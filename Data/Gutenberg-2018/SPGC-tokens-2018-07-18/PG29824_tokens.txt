i
am
thinking
of
a
little
brown
house
somewhere
in
the
wilds
of
new
england
i
wish
i
could
make
my
readers
see
it
as
it
was
one
june
afternoon
some
years
ago
not
for
anything
very
remarkable
about
it
there
are
thousands
of
such
houses
scattered
among
our
hills
and
valleys
nevertheless
one
understands
any
life
story
the
better
for
knowing
amid
what
sort
of
scenes
it
was
unfolded
moreover
such
a
place
is
one
of
the
pleasant
things
in
the
world
to
look
at
as
i
judge
this
was
a
small
house
with
its
gable
end
to
the
road
and
a
at
the
back
over
which
the
long
roof
sloped
down
picturesquely
it
was
that
was
all
of
a
soft
dark
grey
now
that
harmonized
well
enough
with
the
gayer
colours
of
meadows
and
trees
and
two
superb
elms
of
new
england
own
stood
beside
it
and
hung
over
it
enfolding
and
sheltering
the
little
old
house
as
it
were
with
their
arms
of
strength
and
beauty
those
trees
would
have
dignified
anything
one
of
them
of
the
more
rare
weeping
variety
drooped
over
the
door
of
the
shading
it
protectingly
and
hiding
with
its
long
pendant
branches
the
hard
and
stiff
lines
of
the
building
so
the
green
draped
the
grey
until
in
the
soft
mingling
of
hues
the
light
play
of
sunshine
and
shadow
it
seemed
as
if
the
smartness
of
paint
upon
the
old
would
have
been
an
intrusion
and
not
an
advantage
in
front
of
the
house
was
a
little
space
given
to
flowers
at
least
there
were
some
irregular
patches
and
borders
where
balsams
and
hollyhocks
and
pinks
and
marigolds
made
a
spot
of
light
colouring
with
one
or
two
blush
roses
untrained
and
wandering
bearing
a
wealth
of
sweetness
on
their
long
swaying
branches
there
was
that
spot
of
colour
all
around
and
beyond
lay
meadows
orchards
and
cultivated
fields
till
at
no
great
distance
the
ground
became
broken
and
rose
into
a
wilderness
of
hills
mounting
higher
and
higher
in
spots
these
also
showed
cultivation
for
the
most
part
they
were
covered
with
green
woods
in
the
depth
of
june
foliage
the
soft
varied
hilly
outline
filled
the
whole
circuit
of
the
horizon
within
the
nearer
circuit
of
the
hills
the
little
grey
house
sat
alone
with
only
one
single
exception
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
land
half
hid
behind
the
spur
of
a
hill
stood
another
grey
it
might
have
been
half
a
mile
off
people
accustomed
to
a
more
densely
populated
country
would
call
the
situation
lonesome
solitary
it
was
but
nature
had
shaken
down
her
hand
full
of
treasures
over
the
place
art
had
never
so
much
as
looked
that
way
however
we
can
do
without
art
on
a
june
afternoon
the
door
of
the
looked
towards
the
road
and
so
made
a
kind
of
front
door
to
the
kitchen
which
was
within
the
was
raised
a
single
step
above
the
rough
old
grey
stone
which
did
duty
before
it
and
sitting
on
the
doorstep
in
the
shadow
and
sunlight
which
came
through
the
elm
branches
and
fell
over
her
this
june
afternoon
was
the
person
whose
life
story
i
am
going
to
try
to
tell
she
sat
there
as
one
at
home
and
in
the
leisure
of
one
who
had
done
her
work
with
arms
crossed
upon
her
bosom
and
an
air
of
almost
languid
quiet
upon
her
face
the
afternoon
was
genial
warm
sunshine
filled
the
fields
and
grew
hazy
in
the
depth
of
the
hills
the
long
hanging
elm
branches
were
still
sunlight
and
shadow
beneath
slept
in
each
other
arms
soft
breaths
of
air
too
faint
to
move
the
elms
came
nevertheless
with
reminders
and
suggestions
of
all
sorts
of
sweetness
from
the
of
the
woods
from
the
fresh
turf
of
the
meadows
from
a
thousand
hidden
flowers
and
ferns
at
work
in
their
secret
laboratories
distilling
a
thousand
perfumes
mingled
and
untraceable
now
and
then
the
breath
of
the
roses
was
quite
distinguishable
and
from
fields
further
off
the
delicious
scent
of
new
hay
it
was
just
the
time
of
day
when
the
birds
do
not
sing
and
the
watcher
at
the
door
seemed
to
be
in
their
condition
she
was
a
young
woman
full
grown
but
young
her
dress
was
the
common
print
working
dress
of
a
farmer
daughter
with
a
spot
or
two
of
wet
upon
her
apron
showing
that
she
had
been
busy
as
her
dress
suggested
her
sleeves
were
still
rolled
up
above
her
elbows
leaving
the
crossed
arms
full
in
view
and
if
there
is
character
in
faces
so
there
is
in
arms
and
everybody
knows
there
is
in
hands
these
arms
were
after
the
model
of
the
typical
woman
arm
not
chubby
and
round
and
fat
but
moulded
with
beautiful
contour
showing
muscular
form
and
power
with
the
blue
veins
here
and
there
marking
the
clear
delicate
skin
only
look
at
the
arm
without
even
seeing
the
face
and
you
would
feel
there
was
nervous
energy
and
power
of
will
no
weak
flabby
undecided
action
would
ever
come
of
it
the
wrist
was
tapering
enough
and
the
hand
perfectly
shaped
like
the
arm
not
quite
so
white
the
face
you
could
not
read
it
at
once
possibly
not
till
it
had
seen
a
few
more
years
it
was
very
reposeful
this
afternoon
yet
the
brow
and
the
head
bore
tokens
of
the
power
you
would
expect
they
were
very
fine
and
the
eyes
under
the
straight
brow
were
full
and
beautiful
a
deep
changing
and
darkening
at
times
but
the
mouth
and
lower
part
of
the
face
was
as
sweet
and
mobile
as
three
years
old
playing
as
innocently
and
readily
upon
every
occasion
nothing
had
fixed
those
lovely
lines
the
combination
made
it
a
singular
face
and
of
course
very
handsome
but
it
looked
very
unconscious
of
that
fact
within
the
kitchen
another
woman
was
stepping
about
actively
and
now
and
then
cast
an
unsatisfied
look
at
the
doorway
finally
came
to
a
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
to
speak
what
are
you
sittin
there
for
diana
nothing
that
i
know
of
if
i
was
sittin
there
for
nothin
seems
to
me
i
get
up
and
go
somewheres
else
where
said
the
beauty
languidly
anywhere
goodness
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
nothin
would
ever
get
done
to
see
you
sittin
there
so
it
all
done
mother
what
everything
have
you
got
out
the
pink
china
yes
is
your
cake
made
yes
mother
you
saw
me
do
it
i
did
see
you
bakin
it
though
well
it
is
done
did
it
raise
light
and
puffy
beautiful
and
did
get
burned
only
the
least
bit
in
the
corner
no
harm
have
you
cut
the
cheese
and
shivered
the
beef
all
done
then
i
think
you
had
better
go
and
dress
yourself
there
plenty
of
time
nobody
can
be
here
for
two
hours
yet
i
would
sit
and
do
nothin
if
i
was
you
why
not
mother
when
there
is
really
nothing
to
do
i
do
believe
in
no
such
minutes
for
my
part
they
never
come
to
me
look
at
what
i
done
now
there
was
first
the
lighting
the
fire
and
getting
breakfast
then
i
washed
up
and
righted
the
kitchen
and
set
on
the
dinner
then
i
churned
and
brought
the
butter
and
worked
then
there
was
the
dairy
things
then
i
been
in
the
garden
and
picked
four
quarts
of
for
pickles
got
all
down
in
brine
too
then
i
made
out
my
bread
and
made
biscuits
for
tea
and
got
dinner
and
eat
it
and
cleared
it
away
and
boiled
a
ham
not
since
dinner
mother
took
it
out
and
that
and
got
all
my
pots
and
kettles
put
away
and
picked
over
all
that
lot
o
berries
i
think
i
make
preserves
of
diana
when
folks
come
to
sewing
meeting
for
the
missionaries
they
need
have
all
creation
to
eat
seems
to
me
they
do
sew
no
better
for
it
believe
in
fasting
once
in
a
while
what
for
what
for
why
to
keep
down
people
stomach
take
off
a
slice
of
their
pride
mother
do
you
think
eating
and
people
pride
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
i
guess
i
do
i
tell
you
fasting
is
as
good
as
whipping
to
take
down
a
child
stomach
let
get
real
thin
and
empty
and
they
come
down
and
be
as
meek
as
moses
folks
ai
different
from
children
you
never
tried
that
with
me
mother
said
diana
half
laughing
your
father
always
let
you
have
your
own
way
i
could
ha
managed
i
guess
but
your
father
and
you
was
too
much
at
once
come
diana
do
get
up
and
go
off
and
get
dressed
or
something
but
she
sat
still
letting
the
soft
june
air
woo
her
and
the
scents
of
flower
and
field
hold
some
subtle
communion
with
her
there
was
a
certain
hidden
harmony
between
her
and
them
and
yet
they
stirred
her
somehow
uneasily
i
wonder
she
said
after
a
few
minutes
silence
what
a
park
is
like
the
mother
stood
still
again
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
a
park
yes
it
must
be
something
beautiful
and
yet
i
can
not
think
how
it
could
be
prettier
than
this
than
what
said
her
mother
impatiently
just
all
this
all
this
country
and
the
hayfields
and
the
cornfields
and
the
hills
a
park
her
mother
repeated
i
saw
a
once
when
i
was
down
to
new
york
you
would
want
to
see
it
twice
a
homely
little
mite
of
a
green
yard
with
a
big
white
house
in
the
middle
of
it
and
homely
enough
was
too
it
might
do
very
well
for
the
city
folks
but
the
land
knows
i
be
sorry
enough
to
live
there
what
putting
parks
in
your
head
but
the
daughter
did
not
answer
and
the
mother
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
with
perhaps
an
inscrutable
bit
of
pride
and
delight
behind
her
hard
features
it
never
came
out
diana
do
you
calculate
to
be
ready
for
the
sewin
meetin
yes
mother
since
they
must
come
we
may
as
well
make
welcome
and
they
think
it
if
you
meet
in
your
kitchen
dress
is
the
new
minister
comin
do
you
i
do
know
if
anybody
has
told
him
somebody
had
ought
to
it
wo
be
much
of
a
meetin
without
the
minister
and
it
give
him
a
good
chance
to
get
acquainted
hardenburgh
used
to
like
to
come
the
new
man
does
look
much
like
mr
hardenburgh
it
be
a
savin
in
biscuits
if
he
ai
i
used
to
like
to
see
hardenburgh
eat
mother
i
hai
no
objection
when
i
do
have
the
biscuits
to
make
diana
you
baked
a
pan
o
them
biscuits
too
brown
now
you
must
look
out
when
you
put
to
warm
up
or
they
be
crisp
everybody
else
has
them
cold
mother
they
wo
at
my
house
it
just
to
save
trouble
and
there
ai
a
lazy
hair
in
me
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
but
i
thought
you
were
for
taking
down
people
pride
and
keeping
the
sewing
society
low
and
here
are
hot
biscuits
and
all
sorts
of
thing
said
diana
getting
up
from
her
seat
at
last
cream
be
in
the
little
red
pitcher
so
mind
you
do
go
and
take
the
green
one
and
do
be
off
child
and
fix
yourself
for
be
a
while
yet
before
i
ready
and
there
be
nobody
to
see
folks
when
they
come
diana
went
off
slowly
to
her
own
room
there
were
but
two
one
on
each
side
of
the
little
at
the
head
of
the
stair
and
she
and
her
mother
divided
the
floor
between
them
diana
room
was
not
what
one
would
have
expected
from
the
promise
of
all
the
rest
of
the
house
that
was
simple
enough
as
the
dwelling
of
a
small
farmer
would
be
and
much
like
the
other
of
the
region
but
diana
room
a
little
one
it
was
had
one
side
filled
with
bookshelves
and
on
the
bookshelves
was
a
dark
array
of
solid
and
ponderous
volumes
a
table
under
the
front
window
held
one
or
two
that
were
apparently
in
present
use
the
rest
of
the
room
displayed
the
more
usual
fittings
and
surroundings
of
a
maiden
life
only
in
their
essentials
however
no
luxury
was
there
the
little
chest
of
drawers
covered
with
a
white
cloth
held
a
brush
and
comb
and
supported
a
tiny
small
paraphernalia
of
vanity
no
essences
or
perfumes
or
powders
no
curling
sticks
or
crimping
pins
no
rats
or
cats
cushions
or
frames
or
skeletons
of
any
sort
were
there
for
the
help
of
the
rustic
beauty
and
neither
did
she
need
them
so
you
would
have
said
if
you
had
seen
her
when
her
toilette
was
done
the
soft
outlines
of
her
figure
were
neither
helped
nor
hidden
by
any
artificial
contrivances
her
abundant
dark
hair
was
in
smooth
bands
and
a
luxuriant
coil
at
the
back
of
her
head
woman
natural
crown
and
she
looked
when
she
had
finished
her
work
just
because
nature
had
done
so
much
for
her
and
she
had
let
nature
alone
and
because
furthermore
diana
did
not
know
or
at
least
did
not
think
about
her
beauty
when
she
was
in
order
and
it
did
not
take
long
she
placed
herself
at
the
table
under
the
window
before
noticed
and
opening
a
book
that
lay
ready
forgot
i
dare
say
all
about
the
sewing
meeting
till
the
slow
grating
of
wheels
at
the
gate
brought
her
back
to
present
realities
and
she
went
there
was
a
little
old
green
waggon
before
the
house
with
an
old
horse
and
two
women
one
of
whom
had
got
down
and
was
tying
the
horse
head
to
the
fence
are
you
afraid
he
will
run
away
said
the
voice
of
diana
gaily
from
the
garden
massy
no
but
he
might
hitch
round
somewheres
you
know
and
get
himself
into
trouble
thank
ye
i
am
allays
thankful
and
glad
when
i
get
safe
out
o
this
waggin
so
spoke
the
elder
lady
descending
with
diana
help
and
a
great
deal
of
circumlocution
from
her
perch
in
the
vehicle
and
then
they
went
into
the
bright
parlour
where
windows
and
doors
stood
open
and
chairs
had
been
brought
in
ready
to
accommodate
all
who
might
come
it
kind
o
sultry
said
the
same
lady
wiping
her
face
i
declare
these
ellums
o
yourn
do
cast
an
elegant
shadder
it
allays
sort
hampers
me
to
drive
and
i
do
feel
free
till
i
can
let
the
reins
fall
that
how
i
come
to
be
so
heated
dear
me
you
do
excel
in
notions
she
exclaimed
as
diana
presented
some
glasses
of
cool
water
with
raspberry
vinegar
ai
that
wonderful
coolin
will
the
minister
come
to
the
meeting
diana
asked
the
other
woman
he
come
if
he
knowed
he
could
get
anything
like
this
said
the
other
smacking
her
lips
and
sipping
her
glass
slowly
and
then
came
in
her
hostess
if
starling
was
it
can
not
be
denied
that
she
had
a
certain
style
about
her
some
ugly
people
do
country
style
no
doubt
but
these
things
are
relative
and
in
a
smart
black
silk
with
sheer
muslin
neckerchief
and
a
little
cap
her
natural
and
were
very
well
set
off
very
different
from
diana
calm
grace
and
simplicity
the
mother
and
daughter
were
alike
in
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
each
had
character
perhaps
that
is
a
common
fact
in
such
a
region
and
neighbourhood
for
many
of
the
ladies
who
now
came
thronging
in
to
the
meeting
looked
as
if
they
might
justly
lay
claim
to
so
much
praise
the
room
filled
up
thimbles
and
housewives
came
out
of
pockets
work
was
produced
from
baskets
and
bags
and
tongues
went
like
they
put
the
june
afternoon
out
of
countenance
barry
the
good
lady
who
had
arrived
first
took
out
her
knitting
and
in
a
corner
went
over
to
her
neighbour
all
the
incidents
of
her
drive
the
weather
the
getting
out
of
the
waggon
the
shadow
and
the
raspberry
vinegar
carpenter
a
farmer
wife
gave
the
details
of
her
dairy
misfortunes
and
success
to
companion
on
the
next
seat
flandin
discussed
missions
bell
told
how
the
family
of
hardenburgh
had
got
away
on
their
journey
to
their
new
place
of
abode
i
always
liked
hardenburgh
said
carpenter
he
had
a
real
good
wife
remarked
miss
gunn
the
sister
and
that
goes
a
great
way
hardenburgh
was
a
good
woman
but
you
was
speakin
o
hardenburgh
the
dominie
said
salter
he
was
a
man
as
there
war
much
harm
in
i
allays
said
a
man
fault
if
he
ca
make
his
sermons
interestin
i
hardenburgh
preached
real
good
sermons
now
always
seemed
to
me
rejoined
carpenter
he
meant
right
that
what
he
did
that
chimed
in
mansfield
a
rich
farmer
in
her
own
person
there
was
an
owl
up
in
one
of
our
one
night
began
starling
du
tell
so
nigh
that
said
barry
from
her
and
i
took
up
josiah
gun
and
to
shoot
him
but
i
did
he
was
awful
tiresome
there
exclaimed
boddington
what
the
use
of
pretendin
he
war
nobody
could
mind
what
his
sermons
was
about
i
do
believe
as
he
knew
himself
now
a
minister
had
ought
to
know
what
he
means
whether
any
one
else
does
or
not
and
i
like
a
minister
that
makes
know
what
he
means
why
boddington
said
flandin
i
did
know
as
you
cared
anything
about
religion
one
way
or
another
i
got
to
go
to
church
flandin
and
i
a
little
rayther
be
kep
awake
while
i
there
without
pinching
my
fingers
i
prefer
it
why
has
anybody
to
go
to
church
that
does
want
to
go
inquired
diana
but
that
was
like
a
shell
let
off
in
the
midst
of
the
sewing
circle
hear
that
now
said
boddington
ai
that
a
rouser
boddington
was
a
sort
of
a
cousin
and
liked
the
fun
she
lived
in
the
one
in
sight
of
starling
she
do
mean
it
said
mansfield
trust
di
starling
for
meaning
whatever
she
says
returned
the
other
you
and
i
may
understand
it
but
that
all
one
you
know
but
what
she
mean
said
salter
yes
what
the
use
o
havin
a
church
ef
folks
ai
goin
to
it
said
carpenter
no
said
diana
laughing
i
only
asked
why
any
one
go
if
he
do
want
to
where
the
when
we
had
good
hardenburgh
for
example
chimed
in
boddington
who
was
as
loggy
as
he
could
be
good
old
soul
and
put
us
all
to
sleep
or
to
wishin
we
could
my
hai
i
eaten
quarts
o
dill
in
the
course
o
the
summer
trying
to
keep
myself
respectably
awake
and
considerin
o
what
was
goin
on
di
says
why
any
one
eat
all
that
dill
that
do
want
to
cloves
is
better
suggested
miss
gunn
some
laughed
at
this
others
looked
portentously
grave
it
just
one
o
di
nonsense
speeches
said
her
mother
what
they
mean
i
sure
i
do
know
she
reads
too
many
books
to
be
just
like
other
folks
but
the
books
were
written
by
other
folks
mother
la
some
sort
child
not
our
sort
i
guess
hai
di
never
learned
her
catechism
inquired
flandin
is
there
anything
about
going
to
church
in
it
asked
the
girl
there
most
all
sorts
o
good
things
in
it
answered
vaguely
flandin
who
was
afraid
of
committing
herself
i
thought
di
might
learned
there
something
about
such
a
thing
as
we
call
that
so
said
mansfield
just
what
i
am
asking
about
said
di
that
the
thing
why
it
duty
to
go
to
church
when
one
do
want
to
go
well
i
sure
it
was
time
we
had
a
new
minister
said
mrs
salter
and
i
glad
he
come
if
he
no
better
than
old
hardenburgh
it
take
us
a
spell
to
find
it
out
and
that
be
so
much
gained
he
do
like
him
any
way
he
different
ai
he
assented
boddington
if
we
wanted
a
change
we
got
it
how
did
you
all
like
his
sermon
last
sabbath
he
was
very
quiet
said
flandin
i
like
that
said
diana
when
a
man
roars
at
me
i
never
can
tell
what
he
is
saying
he
seemed
to
kind
o
know
his
own
mind
said
salter
i
thought
he
got
an
astonishin
knowledge
o
things
in
the
town
for
the
time
he
had
said
mansfield
i
wisht
he
had
a
family
remarked
miss
gunn
that
all
i
got
agin
him
i
think
a
minister
had
allays
ought
to
have
a
family
he
will
let
him
alone
a
while
said
boddington
time
enough
who
have
we
got
in
town
that
would
do
for
him
the
fruitful
topic
of
debate
and
discussion
here
started
lasted
the
ladies
for
some
time
talk
and
business
got
full
under
weigh
scissors
and
speeches
clipping
and
chattering
knitting
and
the
interminable
yarn
of
small
talk
the
affairs
sickness
and
health
of
every
family
in
the
neighbourhood
with
a
large
discussion
of
character
and
prospects
by
the
way
going
back
to
former
history
and
antecedents
and
forward
to
future
probable
consequences
and
results
nuts
of
society
sweet
confections
of
conversation
of
various
and
changing
flavour
suiting
all
palates
and
warranted
never
to
cloy
then
there
were
farm
prospects
and
doings
also
with
household
matters
very
interesting
to
the
good
ladies
who
all
had
life
interest
in
them
and
the
hours
moved
on
prosperously
here
a
tipped
gently
back
and
forward
in
harmony
with
the
quiet
business
enjoyment
of
its
occupant
and
there
a
pair
of
heels
stretched
out
to
the
farthest
limit
of
their
corresponding
members
with
toes
squarely
elevated
in
the
air
testified
to
the
restful
condition
of
another
individual
of
the
party
see
a
pair
of
toes
in
the
air
and
the
heels
as
nearly
as
possible
straight
under
them
one
tucked
up
on
the
other
and
you
may
be
sure
the
person
they
belong
to
feels
comfortable
physically
and
starling
in
a
corner
in
her
quiet
state
and
gown
was
as
contented
as
an
old
hen
that
sees
all
her
chickens
prosperously
scratching
for
themselves
and
the
june
afternoon
breathed
in
at
the
window
and
upon
all
those
busy
talkers
and
nobody
knew
that
it
was
june
so
things
went
until
diana
left
them
to
put
the
finishing
touches
of
readiness
to
the
her
going
was
noticed
by
some
of
the
assembly
and
taken
as
a
preparatory
note
of
the
coming
entertainment
always
sure
to
be
worth
having
and
coming
for
in
starling
house
needles
and
tongues
took
a
fresh
stir
mis
starling
are
we
goin
to
hev
the
minister
somebody
asked
i
do
know
as
anybody
has
told
him
mis
mansfield
wo

like
a
meetin

the
forenoon

time

to
see
his
cousin
i
they
got
their
young
soldier

miss
barry

boddington
the
knowltons

pretty
well
up
in
the
best
o
times
and
now
evan

home
i
there
be
no

the
looks

and
help
his
la
no
he
home
just
for
a
visit

the
world
but

his
work

work
they
do
hev
to
do
said
salter
there
nobody
to
fight
now
is
there
fight
the
injuns
said
boddington
or
the
mexicans
or
the
english
may
be
anything
that
comes
handy
but
we
hai
no
quarrel
with
the
english
nor
nobody
hev
we
i
thought
we
was
done
fightin
for
the
present
said
miss
barry
in
a
disturbed
tone
of
voice
well
we
be
said
boddington
somebody
might
give
us
a
slap
you
know
when
we
do
expect
it
and
it
best
to
be
ready
and
so
evan
knowlton
be
one
o
them
that
has
to
stand
somewhere
with
his
musket
to
his
shoulder
and
look
after
a
lot
o
powder
behind
him
all
the
while
du
tell
if
it
takes
four
years
to
learn
to
du
that
said
miss
babbage
the
doctor
sister
the
knowltons
is
a
very
fine
family
remarked
miss
gunn
if
the
outside
made
it
said
boddington
do
they
cut
a
shine
when
they
come
into
meetin
though
they
they
do
it
takes
all
the
boys
attention
off
everything
said
flandin
who
was
an
elderly
lady
herself
and
the
girls
added
starling
but
what
more
might
have
been
said
was
cut
short
by
miss
barry
crying
out
that
here
was
the
minister
coming
chapter
ii
the
new
minister
the
little
stir
and
buzz
which
went
round
the
assembly
at
this
news
was
delightful
not
one
but
moved
excitedly
on
her
seat
and
then
settled
herself
for
an
unwonted
good
time
for
the
new
minister
was
undiscovered
ground
an
unexamined
possession
unexplored
treasure
one
sunday
and
two
sermons
had
done
no
more
than
whet
the
appetite
of
the
curious
nobody
had
made
up
his
mind
or
her
mind
on
the
subject
in
regard
to
any
of
its
points
so
there
were
eyes
enough
that
from
starling
windows
watched
the
minister
as
he
dismounted
and
tied
his
horse
to
the
fence
and
then
opened
the
little
gate
and
came
up
to
the
house
diana
had
returned
to
the
room
to
bid
the
company
out
to
supper
but
finding
all
heads
turned
one
way
and
necks
craned
over
and
eyes
on
the
stretch
she
paused
and
waited
for
a
more
auspicious
moment
and
then
came
a
step
in
the
passage
and
the
door
opened
hardenburgh
each
lady
remembered
used
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
company
giving
every
one
a
several
clasp
of
the
hand
and
an
individual
word
of
civility
here
was
a
change
the
new
minister
came
into
the
midst
of
them
and
stood
still
with
a
bright
look
and
a
cheery
good
afternoon
it
was
full
of
good
cheer
and
genial
greeting
but
what
lady
could
respond
to
it
the
greeting
was
not
given
to
the
silence
was
absolute
though
eyes
said
they
had
heard
and
were
listening
i
have
been
down
at
elmfield
the
went
on
not
at
all
disturbed
by
his
reception
and
some
one
informed
me
i
should
find
a
large
circle
of
friends
if
i
came
here
so
i
came
and
i
find
i
was
told
truly
i
guess
we
most
given
you
up
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
coming
out
of
her
corner
now
i
do
know
what
reason
you
had
to
expect
me
nobody
asked
me
to
come
we
real
glad
to
see
you
take
a
chair
said
starling
setting
one
for
his
acceptance
as
she
spoke
hardenburgh
allays
used
to
come
to
our
little
meetin
said
mansfield
thank
you
and
you
expect
me
to
do
all
that
hardenburgh
did
there
was
such
a
quaint
air
of
and
simplicity
in
the
new
minister
manner
that
the
little
assembly
began
to
stir
anew
with
gratification
and
amusement
but
nobody
was
forward
to
answer
in
fact
they
were
a
trifle
shy
of
him
the
late
hardenburgh
had
been
heavy
and
slow
kind
of
course
but
stiff
you
knew
just
what
he
would
do
and
how
he
would
speak
beforehand
there
was
a
delightful
freshness
and
uncertainty
about
this
man
nothing
imposing
either
a
rather
small
slight
figure
with
a
face
that
might
or
might
not
be
called
handsome
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
speaker
but
that
all
would
agree
was
wonderfully
attractive
and
winning
a
fine
broad
brow
an
eye
very
sweet
with
a
build
of
the
jaw
and
lines
of
the
mouth
speaking
both
strength
and
the
absolutest
calm
of
the
mental
nature
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
late
he
went
on
looking
at
his
watch
but
the
roads
are
good
how
far
do
you
call
it
from
elmfield
all
of
five
miles
said
starling
yes
and
one
hill
to
cross
well
i
came
pretty
well
the
long
june
afternoon
favoured
me
hardenburgh
used
to
drive
a
buggy
remarked
miss
barry
yes
is
that
one
of
the
things
you
would
like
me
to
do
as
he
did
well
none
of
our
ministers
ever
went
such
a
venturesome
way
before
said
the
timid
little
old
lady
as
i
do
but
if
had
been
in
a
buggy
miss
barry
this
afternoon
i
am
afraid
you
would
have
got
through
supper
and
been
near
breaking
up
before
i
could
have
joined
your
society
how
long
was
you
comin
then
she
asked
looking
startled
and
there
another
thing
masters
said
mansfield
why
the
days
be
so
much
longer
in
summer
than
in
winter
i
asked
hardenburgh
once
but
i
could
make
out
nothin
from
what
he
told
me
sly
looks
and
suppressed
laughter
went
round
the
room
for
some
of
mansfield
neighbours
were
better
informed
than
she
in
all
that
lay
above
the
level
of
practical
farming
but
masters
quite
gravely
assured
her
he
would
make
it
all
clear
the
first
time
he
had
a
quiet
chance
at
her
house
and
will
you
walk
out
to
supper
friends
said
starling
di
been
standin
waitin
to
call
us
this
half
hour
the
supper
was
laid
on
a
long
table
in
the
which
was
used
as
a
kitchen
but
now
the
fire
was
out
and
the
had
been
boiled
and
was
kept
boiling
in
some
unknown
region
doors
and
windows
stood
open
letting
the
sweet
air
pass
through
and
if
the
floor
was
bare
and
the
chairs
were
wooden
both
one
and
the
other
were
bright
with
cleanliness
and
the
long
board
was
bright
in
another
way
yet
the
word
is
not
misapplied
such
piles
of
snowy
bread
and
golden
cake
such
delicate
cheeses
and
puffy
biscuits
and
such
transparencies
of
preserves
were
an
undoubted
adornment
to
deal
table
and
might
have
been
to
any
table
in
the
world
the
deal
was
covered
however
with
white
cloths
at
the
upper
end
the
hostess
took
her
place
behind
a
regiment
of
cups
and
saucers
officered
by
great
tin
pots
which
held
the
tea
and
coffee
diana
waited
everybody
had
come
expecting
a
good
supper
and
primed
for
enjoyment
and
now
the
enjoyment
began
starling
might
smile
grimly
to
herself
as
she
saw
her
and
jellies
disappear
and
the
piles
of
biscuits
go
down
and
get
heaped
up
again
by
diana
care
nobody
was
at
leisure
enough
to
mark
her
eat
when
you
can
masters
said
boddington
you
wo
get
hot
biscuits
anywhere
in
pleasant
valley
but
here
why
not
said
masters
it
ai
the
fashion
that
all
i
you
seen
the
fashions
down
at
elmfield
masters
said
salter
they
do
think
as
we
hev
no
fashions
up
here
in
the
mountains
their
fashions
is
ridiculous
said
flandin
do
you
think
becomin
masters
for
christian
women
to
go
and
make
sights
of
themselves
in
what
way
mrs
flandin
why
goodness
you
seen
describin
impossible
euphemie
knowlton
she
came
into
church
last
sabbath
three
yards
in
extent
ef
she
was
a
foot
it
beat
me
how
she
was
goin
to
get
in
why
there
war
room
for
but
three
of
in
the
slip
and
it
took
like
half
an
hour
to
get
fixed
in
their
places
i
declare
i
was
ashamed
and
i
had
to
look
for
all
so
had
i
assented
miss
carpenter
i
could
fairly
keep
my
eyes
off
of
and
i
certain
she
could
go
agin
the
wind
with
her
bonnet
it
stuck
just
right
up
from
her
face
and
ended
in
a
pint
and
she
had
a
hull
garden
in
the
brim
of
it
think
ministers
had
ought
to
preach
about
such
doin
and
you
do
know
what
ministers
are
good
for
if
they
do
said
masters
did
ever
see
a
minister
that
could
get
the
better
of
said
boddington
if
you
did
i
would
like
to
go
and
sit
under
his
preachin
a
spell
and
see
what
he
could
do
for
me
does
that
express
the
mind
of
pleasant
valley
generally
asked
the
minister
and
gravely
this
time
la
we
ai
worse
than
other
folks
said
salter
there
no
harm
in
dressin
one
self
smart
now
and
then
is
there
and
we
want
to
know
how
to
be
sure
i
hope
you
do
think
euphemie
knowlton
knows
how
a
quarter
as
becomin
as
the
way
we
dress
in
pleasant
valley
there
ai
the
least
bit
of
prettiness
or
gracefulness
in
a
woman
bein
three
yards
round
anyhow
we
do
think
so
when
it
nature
so
salter
what
do
you
think
o
lettin
your
hair
down
over
the
shoulders
as
if
you
were
goin
to
comb
it
said
boddington
and
goin
to
church
so
but
how
ever
she
make
it
stand
out
as
it
did
asked
miss
carpenter
it
was
just
like
spun
glass
nothin
smooth
or
quiet
about
it
such
a
yellow
mop
i
never
did
see
and
it
war
a
child
neither
who
is
she
anyhow
not
she
it
is
a
grown
woman
said
flandin
and
she
looked
like
a
wild
savage
do
the
minister
agree
with
me
that
it
ai
for
christian
women
to
do
such
things
it
was
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
that
the
minister
answered
where
are
you
going
to
draw
the
line
mrs
flandin
well
with
what
decent
and
comfortable
and
pretty
la
yes
said
salter
do
let
us
be
as
nice
as
we
kin
i
think
people
had
ought
to
make
themselves
as
as
they
can
echoed
one
of
the
younger
ladies
of
the
party
and
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
agreeing
voices
well
said
the
minister
then
comes
the
question
what
is
i
dare
say
the
young
lady
with
the
flowing
tresses
thought
she
was
about
right
she
thought
she
was
the
only
one
said
boddington
a
subject
was
started
now
which
was
fruitful
enough
to
keep
all
tongues
busy
and
whether
biscuits
or
opinions
had
the
most
lively
circulation
for
some
time
thereafter
it
would
be
hard
to
say
old
and
young
upon
this
matter
of
town
and
country
fashions
and
fashion
in
general
gave
tongue
in
concert
proving
that
pleasant
valley
knew
what
was
what
as
well
as
any
place
in
the
land
that
it
was
doubtful
what
right
boston
or
new
york
had
to
dictate
to
it
at
the
same
time
the
means
of
getting
at
the
earliest
the
mind
of
boston
or
new
york
was
eagerly
discussed
and
the
pretensions
of
elmfield
to
any
advantage
in
that
matter
as
earnestly
denied
the
minister
sat
silent
with
an
imperturbable
face
that
did
him
credit
at
last
there
was
a
rush
of
demands
upon
him
for
his
judgment
he
declared
that
so
much
had
been
said
upon
the
subject
he
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
and
he
promised
to
give
them
some
at
least
of
his
thoughts
before
long
in
a
sermon
with
this
promise
highly
satisfied
the
assembly
broke
up
starling
declared
afterwards
to
her
daughter
that
if
there
had
been
any
more
fashions
to
talk
about
they
would
never
have
got
done
supper
but
now
bonnets
were
put
on
and
work
put
up
and
one
after
another
family
party
went
off
in
its
particular
farm
waggon
or
buggy
it
was
but
just
sundown
the
golden
glory
of
the
sky
was
giving
a
mellow
illumination
to
all
the
land
as
one
after
another
the
horses
were
unhitched
the
travellers
mounted
into
their
vehicles
and
the
wheels
went
softly
rolling
off
over
the
smooth
road
the
minister
stood
by
the
gate
helping
the
ladies
to
untie
and
mount
giving
pleasant
words
along
with
pleasant
help
and
receiving
many
expressions
of
pleasure
in
return
dear
me
mr
masters
said
miss
barry
the
last
one
ai
you
afraid
you
catch
cold
standing
there
with
no
hat
on
cold
always
attacks
the
weakest
part
miss
barry
my
head
is
safe
well
i
declare
said
miss
barry
i
never
heerd
that
afore
and
as
she
drove
off
in
her
little
green
waggon
the
minister
and
diana
who
had
come
down
to
the
gate
to
see
the
last
one
off
indulged
in
a
harmless
laugh
then
they
both
stood
still
by
the
fence
a
moment
resting
the
hush
was
so
sweet
the
golden
glory
was
fading
the
last
creak
of
miss
barry
wheels
was
getting
out
of
hearing
the
air
was
perfumed
with
the
scents
which
the
dew
called
forth
is
it
delicious
said
the
minister
leaning
on
the
little
gate
and
pushing
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
the
stillness
is
pleasant
said
diana
yet
you
must
have
enough
of
that
yes
sometimes
said
the
girl
she
was
a
little
shy
of
speaking
her
thoughts
to
the
minister
indeed
she
was
not
accustomed
to
speak
them
to
anybody
not
knowing
where
they
could
meet
entertainment
she
wondered
masters
did
not
go
like
the
rest
however
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
stand
there
talking
to
him
what
do
you
do
for
books
here
he
went
on
o
i
have
all
my
father
books
said
diana
my
father
was
a
minister
masters
and
when
he
died
his
books
came
to
me
a
theological
library
said
masters
yes
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
so
have
you
it
yes
i
have
it
in
my
room
all
one
end
of
the
room
full
do
you
read
these
books
yes
they
are
all
i
have
to
read
i
have
not
read
the
whole
of
them
no
i
suppose
not
do
you
not
find
this
reading
rather
heavy
i
do
know
some
of
the
books
are
rather
heavy
i
do
not
read
those
much
you
must
let
me
look
at
your
library
some
day
miss
diana
it
would
be
certain
to
have
charms
for
me
and
i
exchange
with
you
perhaps
i
have
books
that
you
would
not
find
heavy
diana
full
grey
eyes
turned
on
the
minister
with
a
gleam
of
gratitude
and
pleasure
her
words
were
not
needed
to
say
that
she
would
like
that
kind
of
barter
so
your
father
was
a
clergyman
masters
went
on
yes
not
here
though
that
was
when
i
was
quite
little
we
lived
a
good
way
from
here
and
i
remember
very
well
a
great
many
things
about
all
that
time
till
father
died
and
then
mother
came
back
here
came
then
your
mother
is
at
home
in
pleasant
valley
o
we
both
at
home
here
i
was
so
little
when
we
came
but
father
lived
where
nick
boddington
does
and
owned
all
this
valley
i
do
mean
pleasant
valley
but
all
this
hollow
a
good
large
farm
it
was
and
when
he
died
he
left
mother
a
nice
piece
of
it
with
this
old
house
boddington
is
he
then
a
relation
of
yours
no
not
exactly
he
the
son
of
grandpa
second
wife
we
really
no
relations
but
we
call
each
other
cousin
grandpa
left
the
most
of
his
land
to
his
wife
but
mother
got
enough
to
manage
and
nice
land
it
a
beautiful
place
said
the
minister
there
is
a
waggon
coming
i
wonder
if
any
of
our
friends
have
forgotten
something
that
is
yes
that
farmer
babbage
team
is
it
what
is
the
matter
for
something
unusual
in
the
arrangements
of
the
vehicle
or
the
occupants
of
it
was
dimly
yet
surely
to
be
discerned
through
the
distance
and
the
light
which
was
now
turning
brown
rather
than
grey
nothing
could
be
seen
clearly
and
yet
it
came
as
no
waggon
load
had
gone
from
that
door
that
evening
the
minister
took
his
hand
from
the
gate
and
diana
stepped
forward
as
the
horses
stopped
in
front
of
the
and
a
voice
called
out
who
there
to
help
hollo
lend
a
hand
the
minister
sprang
down
the
road
followed
by
diana
what
do
you
want
help
for
he
asked
there
been
an
accident
jim
delamater
waggon
we
found
it
overturned
in
the
road
and
here
eliza
she
has
spoke
since
have
you
got
no
more
help
where
jim
asked
starling
coming
herself
from
the
staid
with
his
team
about
all
he
was
up
to
now
then
can
we
get
her
in
where
josiah
but
no
more
masculine
help
could
be
mustered
than
what
was
already
on
hand
brains
however
can
do
much
to
supplement
muscular
force
the
minister
had
a
settee
out
from
the
house
in
two
minutes
and
by
the
side
of
the
waggon
with
management
and
care
though
with
much
difficulty
the
unconscious
girl
was
lifted
down
and
laid
on
the
settee
and
by
the
aid
of
the
women
carried
straight
into
the
the
door
of
which
was
the
nearest
there
by
the
same
energetic
ordering
well
seconded
by
diana
a
mattress
was
brought
and
laid
on
the
long
table
which
starling
diligence
had
already
cleared
since
supper
and
there
they
placed
the
girl
who
was
perfectly
helpless
and
motionless
in
their
hands
there
is
life
yet
said
the
minister
after
an
examination
during
which
every
one
stood
breathless
around
loose
everything
she
has
on
miss
diana
and
let
us
have
some
hartshorn
starling
if
you
have
got
any
well
brandy
then
and
cold
water
and
i
go
for
the
doctor
but
babbage
represented
that
he
must
himself
on
hum
and
would
pass
by
the
doctor
door
so
if
the
minister
would
stay
and
help
the
women
folks
it
would
be
more
advisable
accordingly
the
waggon
wheels
were
soon
heard
departing
and
the
little
group
in
the
kitchen
were
left
alone
too
busy
at
first
to
think
of
it
they
were
trying
eagerly
every
restorative
and
stimulant
they
could
think
of
and
command
but
with
little
effect
a
little
they
thought
but
consciousness
had
not
returned
to
the
injured
girl
when
they
had
done
all
they
knew
how
to
do
and
tried
everything
within
their
reach
hope
began
to
fade
towards
despair
still
they
kept
on
with
the
use
of
their
remedies
starling
went
and
came
between
the
room
where
they
were
and
the
stove
which
stood
in
some
outside
shed
fetching
bottles
of
hot
water
i
think
between
whiles
she
was
washing
up
her
cups
and
saucers
the
other
two
in
the
silence
of
her
absences
could
feel
the
strange
solemn
contrasts
which
one
must
feel
and
does
even
in
the
midst
of
keener
anxieties
than
those
which
beset
the
watchers
there
the
girl
a
fair
rather
pretty
person
and
generally
liked
lay
still
and
senseless
on
the
table
round
which
she
and
others
a
little
while
ago
had
been
seated
at
supper
very
still
the
room
was
now
that
had
been
full
of
voices
the
smell
of
camphor
and
brandy
was
about
the
table
was
wet
in
one
great
spot
with
the
cold
water
which
had
been
applied
to
the
girl
face
and
through
the
open
door
and
windows
came
the
stir
of
the
sweet
night
air
and
the
sound
of
insects
and
the
gurgle
of
a
brook
that
ran
a
few
yards
off
peaceful
free
glad
as
if
all
were
as
it
had
been
last
night
or
nature
took
no
cognizance
of
human
affairs
the
minister
had
been
very
active
and
helpful
bringing
wood
and
drawing
water
and
making
up
the
fire
as
well
as
anybody
starling
said
afterwards
he
had
taken
his
part
in
the
actual
nursing
and
better
than
anybody
diana
thought
now
the
two
stood
silent
and
grave
by
the
long
table
while
they
still
kept
up
the
application
of
brandy
to
the
face
and
heat
to
the
extremities
and
rubbing
the
hands
and
wrists
of
the
patient
did
you
know
miss
delamater
well
asked
the
minister
yes
as
i
know
nearly
all
the
girls
diana
answered
do
you
think
she
is
ready
for
the
change
if
she
must
make
it
diana
hesitated
i
never
heard
her
speak
on
the
subject
she
said
she
was
a
member
of
the
church
silence
followed
and
they
were
two
grave
faces
still
that
bent
over
the
table
but
there
was
the
difference
between
the
shadow
on
a
mountain
lake
where
there
is
not
a
ripple
and
the
dark
stir
of
troubled
waters
diana
eye
every
now
and
then
glanced
for
an
instant
at
the
face
of
her
companion
it
was
very
grave
but
the
broad
brow
was
as
quiet
as
if
all
its
questions
were
answered
and
the
mouth
was
sweet
and
at
rest
in
its
stillness
she
wished
he
would
speak
again
there
was
something
in
him
that
provoked
her
curiosity
he
did
speak
presently
this
shows
us
what
the
meaning
of
life
is
he
said
no
said
diana
it
does
to
me
it
is
just
a
puzzle
and
as
much
a
puzzle
here
as
ever
i
see
what
the
use
of
life
is
or
what
we
all
live
for
i
do
see
what
it
amounts
to
what
do
you
mean
asked
her
companion
but
not
as
if
he
were
startled
and
diana
went
on
i
should
say
so
if
people
were
always
having
a
good
time
and
if
they
were
just
right
and
did
just
right
but
they
are
not
masters
you
know
they
are
not
even
the
best
of
them
that
i
see
and
things
like
are
always
happening
one
way
or
another
if
it
is
here
it
is
somewhere
else
and
if
it
is
one
time
it
is
another
and
it
is
all
confusion
i
do
see
what
it
all
comes
to
that
is
the
thought
of
a
moment
of
pain
said
the
minister
no
it
is
not
said
diana
i
think
it
often
i
think
it
all
the
while
now
this
very
afternoon
i
was
sitting
at
the
door
here
you
know
what
sort
of
a
day
it
has
been
mr
masters
i
know
perfect
just
june
well
i
was
looking
at
it
and
feeling
how
lovely
it
was
everything
perfect
and
somehow
all
that
perfection
took
a
kind
of
sharp
edge
and
hurt
me
i
was
thinking
why
nothing
in
the
world
was
like
it
or
agreed
with
it
nothing
in
human
life
i
mean
this
afternoon
when
the
company
was
here
and
all
the
talk
going
on
was
like
nothing
out
of
doors
all
the
while
and
is
not
like
it
there
was
a
sigh
deep
drawn
that
came
through
the
minister
lips
then
he
spoke
cheerfully
ay
god
works
have
parted
company
somehow
parted
said
diana
curiously
yes
you
remember
surely
that
when
he
had
made
all
things
at
first
he
beheld
them
very
good
well
they
are
not
very
good
now
not
all
of
them
whose
fault
is
that
i
know
said
diana
but
that
does
not
help
me
with
my
puzzle
why
does
the
world
go
on
so
what
is
the
use
of
my
living
or
anybody
what
does
it
amount
to
that
your
lesson
the
minister
answered
with
a
quick
glance
from
his
calm
eyes
not
a
bit
of
sentiment
or
of
speculative
rhapsody
there
but
downright
cool
common
sense
with
just
a
little
bit
of
authority
diana
did
not
know
exactly
how
to
meet
it
and
before
she
had
arranged
her
words
they
heard
wheels
again
and
then
the
doctor
came
in
the
doctor
approved
of
what
had
been
done
and
aided
in
renewed
application
of
the
same
remedies
after
a
time
these
seemed
at
last
successful
the
girl
revived
and
the
doctor
after
administering
a
little
tea
and
weak
brandy
and
water
ordered
that
she
should
be
kept
quiet
where
she
was
the
room
be
darkened
when
daylight
came
on
the
windows
kept
open
and
handkerchiefs
wet
with
cold
water
be
laid
on
her
head
and
then
he
took
his
departure
and
diana
went
to
communicate
to
her
mother
the
orders
he
had
left
keep
her
there
echoed
starling
in
the
she
be
a
deal
better
in
her
bed
we
must
make
her
bed
there
mother
there
on
the
table
do
you
mean
diana
starling
you
are
a
baby
she
must
be
stirred
mother
he
says
that
the
very
thing
exclaimed
starling
she
had
ought
to
been
carried
into
one
of
the
at
the
first
and
i
said
so
and
the
new
minister
he
would
have
it
all
his
own
way
but
she
must
have
all
the
air
she
could
mother
you
know
air
said
starling
do
you
she
would
smother
in
one
of
the
chambers
where
many
a
one
before
her
has
laid
sick
and
well
and
got
along
too
air
indeed
the
house
ai
like
a
corked
bottle
i
guess
not
much
said
diana
but
masters
said
and
the
doctor
says
that
she
can
not
have
too
much
air
o
well
eggs
ca
be
beat
too
much
neither
but
it
do
follow
you
to
stand
beating
for
ever
i
no
patience
where
am
i
going
to
do
my
ironing
i
should
like
the
minister
for
to
tell
me
or
get
meals
or
anything
else
i
do
see
what
possessed
josiah
to
go
and
see
his
folks
of
all
nights
we
have
not
wanted
him
mother
after
all
that
i
see
i
have
wanted
him
said
starling
if
he
had
been
home
i
to
have
had
queer
help
and
missed
knowing
who
was
head
of
the
house
well
go
along
and
fix
it
you
and
the
minister
but
mother
i
want
to
get
eliza
things
off
and
to
make
her
bed
comfortably
and
i
ca
do
it
without
you
well
get
rid
of
the
minister
then
and
i
come
him
and
me
is
too
many
in
one
house
the
minister
would
not
leave
the
two
women
alone
and
go
home
as
diana
proposed
to
him
but
he
went
to
make
his
horse
comfortable
while
they
did
the
same
for
the
sick
girl
and
then
he
took
up
his
post
just
outside
the
door
in
the
moonlight
which
came
fitfully
through
the
elm
branches
and
he
and
diana
talked
no
more
that
night
he
was
watchful
and
helpful
for
he
kept
up
the
fire
in
the
stove
and
once
more
brought
wood
when
it
was
needed
moonlight
melted
away
at
last
into
the
dawn
cool
clear
outlines
began
to
take
place
of
the
soft
mystery
of
night
shadows
then
the
warm
glow
from
the
east
behind
the
house
and
the
glint
of
the
sunbeams
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
on
the
racks
of
cloud
lying
along
the
horizon
diana
still
kept
her
place
by
the
improvised
bed
and
the
minister
kept
his
just
outside
the
door
starling
began
to
prepare
for
breakfast
and
finally
josiah
the
on
the
little
farm
came
from
his
excursion
and
from
the
barn
bringing
the
pails
of
milk
then
the
minister
fetched
his
horse
and
came
in
to
shake
hands
with
diana
he
would
not
stay
for
breakfast
she
watched
him
down
to
the
gate
where
he
threw
himself
on
his
grey
steed
and
went
off
at
a
smooth
gallop
swift
and
steady
sitting
as
if
he
were
more
at
home
on
a
horse
back
than
anywhere
else
diana
looked
after
him
certainly
she
thought
that
is
unlike
all
the
other
ministers
that
ever
came
to
pleasant
valley
he
off
is
he
said
starling
as
her
daughter
came
in
now
diana
take
notice
do
you
go
and
take
a
fancy
to
this
new
man
because
i
wo
favour
it
nor
have
anything
of
the
kind
going
on
i
tell
you
beforehand
there
is
very
little
danger
of
his
taking
a
fancy
to
me
mother
i
do
know
about
that
he
might
do
worse
but
you
could
for
never
have
anything
to
say
to
you
if
you
do
why
mother
inquired
diana
in
much
surprise
i
should
think
like
him
i
should
think
everybody
would
why
do
you
like
him
he
too
masterful
for
me
mind
what
i
tell
you
diana
it
absurd
mother
such
a
one
as
masters
never
would
think
of
such
a
one
as
i
am
he
a
very
cultivated
man
mother
and
has
been
accustomed
to
very
different
society
from
what
he
find
here
i
seem
to
him
what
i
seem
to
you
i
hope
not
said
starling
for
you
seem
to
me
a
goose
cultivated
who
is
cultivated
if
you
are
not
were
you
a
whole
year
at
school
in
boston
i
guess
my
gentleman
has
been
to
a
better
place
and
war
you
for
ever
reading
those
musty
old
books
that
make
you
out
of
kilter
for
all
world
if
you
do
fit
his
neither
sorry
society
indeed
there
no
better
society
than
the
folks
of
pleasant
valley
do
you
go
and
set
yourself
up
nor
him
neither
diana
knew
better
than
to
carry
on
the
discussion
meanwhile
the
grey
horse
that
bore
the
minister
home
kept
up
that
long
smooth
gallop
for
a
half
mile
or
so
then
slackened
it
to
walk
up
a
hill
that
a
very
remarkable
girl
the
minister
was
saying
to
himself
with
much
more
in
her
than
she
knows
the
gallop
began
again
in
a
few
minutes
and
was
unbroken
till
he
got
home
it
was
but
a
piece
of
a
home
masters
had
rooms
in
the
house
of
persimmon
a
poor
widow
living
among
the
hills
the
rooms
were
neat
that
was
all
that
could
be
said
for
them
little
and
dark
and
low
with
bits
of
windows
and
with
the
simplest
of
furnishing
the
was
cheerful
with
books
however
as
cheerful
as
books
can
make
a
room
and
the
minister
did
not
look
uncheerful
but
very
grave
if
his
brow
was
neither
wrinkled
nor
lined
the
quiet
eyes
beneath
it
were
deep
with
thought
masters
morning
was
spent
on
this
wise
first
of
all
for
a
good
half
hour
his
knees
were
bent
and
his
thoughts
whatever
they
were
gave
him
work
to
do
that
work
done
the
minister
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
slept
as
quietly
as
he
did
everything
else
for
an
hour
or
two
more
then
he
rose
shaved
and
dressed
took
such
breakfast
as
persimmon
could
give
him
mounted
his
grey
again
and
was
off
to
a
house
at
some
distance
where
there
was
a
sick
child
and
another
house
where
there
dwelt
an
infirm
old
man
between
these
two
the
hours
were
spent
till
he
rode
home
to
dinner
chapter
iii
harnessing
prince
the
improvement
of
the
sick
girl
was
better
than
had
been
hoped
it
was
but
a
day
or
two
before
starling
heart
desire
could
be
effected
and
her
kitchen
cleared
eliza
was
moved
to
another
room
and
at
the
week
end
was
taken
home
it
was
the
next
day
after
this
had
been
done
and
diana
was
sitting
again
in
the
elm
shadow
at
the
door
of
the
not
idly
this
time
for
a
pan
of
peas
was
in
her
lap
and
her
fingers
were
busy
with
shelling
them
still
her
eyes
were
very
much
more
busy
with
the
lovely
light
and
shade
on
meadow
and
hill
her
glances
went
up
and
down
from
her
pan
to
the
sunny
landscape
starling
bustling
about
as
usual
within
the
house
and
never
looking
out
presently
hearing
the
gate
latch
called
out
who
that
joe
bartlett
mother
diana
answered
without
moving
it
was
not
the
gate
that
led
to
the
flower
patch
and
the
front
door
that
was
some
distance
off
another
little
brown
gate
under
the
opened
directly
in
front
of
the
door
and
the
patch
between
was
all
in
fleckered
sunlight
and
shadow
like
the
doorway
where
diana
sat
the
little
gate
opening
now
admitted
a
visitor
who
was
in
appearance
the
very
typical
yankee
of
the
story
books
long
in
the
limbs
loose
in
the
joints
angular
ungainly
he
came
up
the
walk
with
a
movement
that
would
tempt
one
to
think
he
had
not
got
accustomed
to
his
inches
and
did
not
yet
know
quite
what
to
do
with
them
all
he
had
a
long
face
red
in
colour
in
expression
a
mixture
of
honest
frankness
carelessness
and
good
humour
mornin
said
he
as
he
came
near
how
your
folks
this
forenoon
quite
well
all

of

joe
said
diana
shelling
her
peas
as
she
looked
up
at
him
how

mother

she

smart
mother

to
be

joe
i

other
things
to
do
well
do
you
think
a
good
sort

said
diana
shelling
her
peas
very
fast
you
see
it
pretty
silent
down
to
our
place
that
is
when
i
to
hum
and
i
ca
be
there
much
o

and
the
old

it
pretty
much
her

way
as
to
conversation
the
rest
o
the
time
she
can
talk
to
what
she
likes
but
there
ai
nothin
as
can
make
a
remark
back
to
her
it
too
bad
joe
fact
said
joe
seriously
all
the
rest
had
been
said
with
a
smile
but
you
know
mother

your
bonnit
and
run
down
and
set

a
notion

her
hay

out
a
handsome
swath
but
it
had
ought
to
be
all
down
now
well
good
day
hurry
up
now
for
down
yonder
diana
brought
in
her
pan
of
peas
mother
where
josiah
davis
where
should
he
be
he
up
in
the
hill
lot
cuttin
hay
that
grass
is
all
in
flower
it
had
ought
to
been
cut
a
week
ago
but
josiah
always
has
one
of
his
hands
behind
him
and
he
wo
be
in
till
noon
i
must
harness
the
waggon
myself
if
you
can
catch
the
horse
said
her
mother
he
turned
out
in
the
lot
it
a
poor
job
at
this
time
o
day
i
try
and
make
a
good
job
of
it
said
diana
so
she
took
her
and
went
out
to
the
barn
the
old
horse
was
not
far
off
for
the
lot
in
this
case
meant
simply
the
small
field
in
which
the
barn
and
the
barnyard
were
enclosed
but
being
a
wary
old
animal
with
a
good
deal
of
experience
of
life
he
had
come
to
know
that
a
halter
and
a
pan
of
corn
generally
meant
hard
work
near
at
hand
and
was
wo
to
be
shy
of
such
allurements
diana
could
sometimes
do
better
than
anybody
else
with
old
prince
they
were
on
good
terms
and
prince
had
sense
enough
to
take
notice
that
she
never
followed
the
plough
and
was
therefore
a
safer
venture
than
his
other
flatterers
with
the
corn
and
the
halter
diana
now
sought
the
corner
where
prince
was
standing
whisking
his
tail
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
but
it
was
a
warm
morning
and
seeing
her
approach
prince
quietly
walked
off
into
the
sun
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
went
on
to
another
shady
some
distance
away
diana
followed
speaking
to
him
but
prince
repeated
his
ungallant
manoeuvre
and
from
tree
to
tree
across
the
sunny
field
diana
trudged
after
him
until
she
was
hot
and
tired
perhaps
philosophy
came
in
play
at
last
warning
him
that
this
game
could
not
go
on
for
ever
and
would
certainly
end
in
his
discomfiture
some
time
for
with
no
apparent
reason
for
his
change
of
tactics
he
stood
still
at
length
under
the
tree
farthest
from
the
barn
and
suffered
himself
to
be
made
captive
diana
got
the
halter
on
and
flushed
and
excited
with
the
chase
led
him
back
over
the
lot
and
out
to
the
road
where
josiah
had
very
culpably
left
the
little
waggon
standing
in
the
shade
of
the
elm
close
by
the
gate
just
as
she
got
there
diana
saw
a
stranger
who
had
his
hand
on
the
gate
but
who
left
it
now
and
came
forward
to
speak
to
her
diana
stood
by
the
thills
of
the
waggon
horse
in
hand
but
to
tell
the
truth
forgetting
both
the
stranger
was
unlike
anything
often
seen
in
pleasant
valley
he
wore
the
uniform
of
an
army
officer
there
was
a
stripe
of
gold
down
the
seam
of
his
pantaloons
and
a
gold
bar
across
his
shoulders
and
his
cap
was
a
soldier
cap
but
it
was
not
on
his
head
just
now
it
had
come
off
since
he
quitted
the
gate
and
the
step
with
which
he
drew
near
was
the
very
contrast
to
joe
bartlett
lounging
pace
this
was
measured
clean
compact
and
firm
withal
as
light
and
even
as
that
of
an
antelope
his
hair
showed
the
regulation
cut
and
diana
saw
with
the
same
glance
a
pair
of
light
brilliant
hazel
eyes
and
a
finely
trimmed
mustache
stood
flushed
and
still
halter
in
hand
with
her
pushed
a
little
back
for
air
the
stranger
smiled
just
a
little
may
i
ask
how
far
i
am
from
a
place
called
elmfield
it
is
diana
thoughts
wandered
it
is
five
miles
i
ought
not
to
need
to
ask
but
i
have
been
so
long
do
you
know
how
or
where
i
can
get
a
horse
or
any
conveyance
to
bring
me
there
i
have
ridden
beyond
this
and
met
with
an
accident
diana
hesitated
is
it
lieut
knowlton
she
said
ah
you
know
me
said
he
i
forgot
that
pleasant
valley
knows
me
better
than
i
know
pleasant
valley
i
did
not
count
on
finding
a
friend
here
his
eye
glanced
at
the
little
brown
house
everybody
knows
elmfield
said
diana
and
i
guessed
from
my
dress
said
knowlton
following
the
direction
of
her
look
this
was
accident
too
but
which
of
my
friends
ought
i
to
know
here
that
i
do
know
pardon
me
but
is
this
horse
to
be
put
to
the
waggon
or
taken
away
from
it
o
i
was
going
to
put
him
in
allow
me
said
the
young
man
taking
the
halter
from
diana
willing
hands
but
where
is
the
harnessing
gear
o
that
is
in
the
barn
exclaimed
diana
i
will
go
and
fetch
it
pray
no
let
me
get
it
said
her
companion
and
giving
the
end
of
the
halter
a
turn
round
one
of
the
thills
he
had
overtaken
her
before
she
had
well
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
they
went
together
through
the
barnyard
diana
found
the
harness
and
the
young
officer
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
with
a
smile
at
her
which
answered
her
deprecating
words
a
smile
extremely
pleasant
and
gentlemanly
if
withal
a
little
arch
diana
shrank
back
somewhat
before
the
glance
which
to
her
fancy
showed
the
power
of
keen
observation
along
with
the
habit
of
giving
orders
they
went
back
to
the
elm
and
knowlton
harnessed
the
horse
diana
explaining
in
a
word
or
two
the
necessity
under
which
she
had
been
acting
and
what
about
my
dilemma
said
he
presently
as
his
task
was
finished
there
is
no
horse
or
waggon
you
could
get
anywhere
that
i
know
of
said
diana
the
teams
are
apt
to
be
in
use
just
now
but
i
am
going
down
to
within
a
mile
of
elmfield
and
i
was
going
to
say
if
you
like
i
can
take
you
so
far
and
who
will
do
me
such
kindness
who
o
diana
starling
is
that
a
name
i
ought
to
know
inquired
knowlton
i
shall
know
it
from
this
day
but
how
about
before
i
have
been
gone
from
pleasant
valley
at
school
and
at
the
military
academy
four
five
ten
years
mother
came
back
here
to
live
just
ten
years
ago
my
conscience
is
clear
he
said
smiling
i
was
beginning
to
whip
myself
now
are
we
ready
not
quite
for
diana
went
into
the
house
for
her
gloves
and
a
straw
hat
she
made
no
other
change
in
her
dress
having
taken
off
her
apron
before
she
set
out
after
prince
she
found
her
new
friend
standing
with
the
reins
in
his
hand
as
if
he
were
to
drive
and
not
she
and
diana
was
helped
into
her
own
waggon
with
a
deferential
courtesy
which
up
to
that
time
she
had
only
read
of
in
books
nor
known
much
even
so
it
silenced
her
at
first
she
sat
down
as
mute
as
a
child
and
knowlton
handled
prince
and
the
waggon
and
all
in
the
style
of
one
that
knew
how
and
had
the
right
that
drive
however
was
not
to
be
silent
or
stiff
in
any
degree
knowlton
for
his
part
had
no
shyness
or
hesitation
belonging
to
him
he
had
seen
the
world
and
learnt
its
freedom
diana
was
only
a
simple
country
girl
and
had
never
seen
the
world
yet
she
was
as
little
troubled
with
embarrassment
of
any
sort
partly
this
was
no
doubt
because
of
her
sound
healthy
new
england
nature
the
solid
which
does
not
need
nor
use
to
put
itself
in
the
balance
with
anything
else
to
be
assured
of
its
own
quality
but
part
belonged
to
diana
own
personalty
in
a
simple
large
nature
too
simple
and
too
large
to
feel
small
motives
or
to
know
petty
issues
if
her
cheeks
and
brow
were
flushed
at
first
it
was
because
the
sun
had
been
hot
in
the
lot
and
prince
tiresome
she
was
as
composedly
herself
as
ever
the
young
officer
could
be
but
i
think
each
of
them
was
a
little
excited
by
the
companionship
of
the
other
do
you
drive
this
old
fellow
yourself
asked
knowlton
after
a
little
but
i
need
not
ask
of
course
you
do
there
no
difficulty
and
not
much
danger
he
added
with
a
tone
so
dry
and
comical
that
they
both
burst
into
a
laugh
i
assure
you
i
am
very
glad
to
have
prince
said
diana
he
is
so
old
now
that
they
generally
let
him
off
from
the
farm
work
he
takes
mother
and
me
to
church
and
stands
ready
for
anything
i
want
most
of
the
time
lucky
for
me
too
said
knowlton
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
the
sun
very
hot
i
o
no
i
do
mind
it
at
all
said
diana
there
a
nice
air
now
where
is
your
horse
knowlton
you
said
you
had
an
accident
yes
that
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
beyond
your
house
and
is
your
horse
there
must
be
i
think
i
shall
send
some
people
to
remove
him
why
is
he
i
should
not
have
left
him
else
miss
starling
diana
did
not
choose
to
go
on
with
a
string
of
questions
and
her
companion
hesitated
it
my
own
fault
he
said
with
a
sort
of
displeased
half
laugh
a
piece
of
boyish
thoughtlessness
that
i
paid
for
there
was
a
nice
red
cow
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
road
where
said
diana
wondering
just
ahead
of
me
a
few
rods
she
was
lying
quite
quietly
taking
her
morning
siesta
in
the
sun
plunged
in
ruminative
thoughts
i
supposed
and
the
temptation
was
irresistible
to
go
over
without
disturbing
her
her
said
diana
in
a
maze
yes
i
counted
on
what
one
should
never
count
on
what
i
did
know
what
was
that
whether
it
would
occur
to
her
to
get
upon
her
legs
just
at
that
moment
and
she
did
inquired
diana
she
did
what
did
that
do
mr
knowlton
threw
my
poor
steed
off
legs
forever
and
here
in
despite
of
his
vexation
which
was
real
and
apparent
the
young
man
burst
into
a
laugh
diana
had
not
got
at
his
meaning
and
where
were
you
mr
knowlton
on
his
back
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
being
such
a
boy
you
understand
the
creature
rose
up
just
in
time
to
be
in
the
way
of
my
leap
and
we
were
thrown
over
my
horse
and
i
thrown
you
were
not
hurt
mr
knowlton
i
deserved
it
did
but
i
was
nothing
the
worse
except
for
losing
my
horse
and
my
was
the
horse
killed
no
not
by
the
fall
but
he
was
injured
so
that
i
saw
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
put
him
out
of
life
at
once
so
i
did
it
i
had
my
pistols
i
often
ride
with
them
to
be
ready
for
any
sport
that
may
offer
i
am
very
much
ashamed
to
have
to
tell
you
this
story
of
myself
there
was
so
much
of
earnestness
in
the
expression
of
the
last
sentence
it
was
said
with
such
a
deferential
contrition
if
i
may
so
speak
that
diana
thoughts
experienced
a
diversion
from
the
subject
that
had
occasioned
them
the
contrition
came
more
home
than
the
fault
by
common
consent
they
went
off
to
other
matters
of
talk
diana
explained
and
commented
on
the
history
and
features
of
pleasant
valley
so
far
at
least
as
her
companion
questions
called
for
such
explanation
and
that
was
a
good
deal
knowlton
gave
her
details
of
his
own
life
and
experience
which
were
much
more
interesting
she
thought
the
conversation
ran
freely
and
again
and
again
eyes
met
eyes
full
in
sympathy
over
some
grave
or
laughing
point
of
intelligence
and
what
is
there
in
the
meeting
of
eyes
what
if
the
one
pair
were
sparkling
and
quick
and
the
brow
over
them
bore
the
fair
lines
of
command
what
though
the
other
pair
were
deep
and
thoughtful
and
sweet
and
the
brow
one
that
promised
passion
and
power
a
thousand
other
eyes
might
have
looked
on
either
one
of
them
and
forgotten
these
two
looked
and
remembered
you
can
not
tell
why
it
is
the
old
story
the
hidden
unreadable
affinity
making
itself
known
to
its
counterpart
the
sign
and
countersign
of
nature
but
it
was
only
nature
that
gave
and
took
not
diana
and
knowlton
meanwhile
prince
had
an
easy
time
and
the
little
waggon
went
very
gently
over
the
smooth
roads
past
one
farm
after
another
prince
go
faster
than
this
diana
confided
at
last
to
her
companion
he
does
want
to
does
he
diana
laughed
and
knew
in
her
heart
she
was
of
prince
mind
however
even
five
miles
will
come
to
an
end
in
time
if
you
keep
going
even
slowly
and
in
time
the
little
brown
house
of
bartlett
appeared
in
the
distance
and
prince
drew
the
waggon
up
before
the
door
diana
alighted
and
knowlton
drove
on
promising
to
send
the
waggon
back
from
elmfield
it
was
coming
down
in
more
ways
than
one
to
get
out
of
the
waggon
and
go
in
to
make
her
visit
diana
did
not
feel
just
ready
for
it
she
loosened
the
strings
of
her
hat
walked
slowly
up
the
path
between
the
hollyhocks
that
led
to
the
door
and
there
stopped
and
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
knowlton
in
the
distance
such
a
ride
as
she
had
had
such
an
entertainment
people
in
pleasant
valley
did
not
talk
like
that
nor
look
like
that
how
much
difference
it
makes
to
have
education
and
to
see
the
world
and
a
military
education
especially
has
a
more
liberalizing
and
adorning
effect
than
the
course
of
life
in
the
colleges
the
manner
of
a
soldier
has
in
it
a
charm
which
is
wanting
in
the
manner
of
a
minister
as
for
farmers
they
have
no
manners
at
all
and
the
very
faces
thought
diana
well
she
could
not
stand
there
on
the
she
must
go
in
she
turned
and
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
the
little
room
within
was
empty
it
was
a
tiny
house
the
ground
floor
boasted
only
two
rooms
and
each
of
those
was
small
the
broad
hearth
of
flagstones
took
up
a
third
of
the
floor
of
this
one
a
fire
burned
in
the
chimney
though
the
day
was
so
warm
and
a
with
a
faded
cushion
in
it
stood
by
the
chimney
corner
with
a
bunch
of
knitting
lying
on
the
cushion
diana
tapped
at
an
inner
door
at
her
right
and
then
getting
no
answer
went
across
the
kitchen
and
opened
another
opposite
the
one
that
had
admitted
her
chapter
iv
mother
bartlett
the
little
house
unpainted
like
many
others
had
no
fenced
enclosure
on
this
side
a
wide
field
stretched
away
from
the
back
door
lying
partly
upon
a
and
several
cattle
were
pasturing
in
it
farm
fields
and
meadows
were
all
around
except
where
this
one
hill
rose
up
behind
the
house
it
was
wooded
at
the
top
below
the
ranks
of
a
cornfield
sloped
aspiringly
up
its
base
a
narrow
footpath
which
only
the
tread
of
feet
kept
free
from
weeds
and
grass
went
off
obliquely
to
a
little
enclosed
garden
which
lay
beyond
the
corner
of
the
house
in
some
arbitrary
and
independent
way
not
adjoining
it
at
all
it
was
a
sweet
bit
of
country
soft
and
mellow
under
the
summer
sun
still
as
grasshoppers
and
the
tinkle
of
a
cowbell
could
make
it
and
very
far
from
most
of
the
improvements
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
smell
of
the
pasture
and
the
fragrance
that
came
from
the
fresh
shades
of
the
wood
and
the
freedom
of
the
broad
fields
of
pure
ether
made
it
rich
with
some
of
nature
homely
wealth
which
is
not
by
any
means
the
worst
there
is
diana
knew
the
place
very
well
her
eyes
were
looking
now
for
the
mistress
of
it
and
not
long
in
the
lying
garden
she
discerned
her
white
cap
and
at
the
gate
met
her
bringing
a
head
of
lettuce
in
her
hands
i
knew
you
liked
it
dear
she
said
and
i
had
forgot
all
about
it
and
then
it
flashed
on
me
and
i
thought
diana
will
like
to
have
it
for
her
dinner
and
i
guess
it
have
time
to
cool
just
put
it
in
a
tin
pail
dear
and
hang
it
down
in
the
well
and
it
be
fresh
this
was
done
and
diana
came
in
and
took
a
seat
by
her
old
friend
you
need
do
that
for
me
mother
bartlett
i
do
care
what
i
have
to
eat
most
folks
like
what
is
good
said
the
old
lady
they
know
it
yes
and
so
do
i
but
i
made
a
for
ye
the
old
lady
went
on
contentedly
and
i
suppose
you
have
left
nothing
at
all
for
me
to
do
as
usual
it
is
too
bad
mother
bartlett
you
shall
do
all
the
rest
said
her
friend
and
now
you
may
talk
to
me
she
was
a
trim
little
old
woman
not
near
so
tall
as
her
visitor
very
wrinkled
but
and
with
a
quick
grey
eye
her
dress
was
a
common
working
dress
of
some
dark
stuff
coarse
but
tidy
and
her
cap
white
and
plain
she
sat
in
her
setting
her
little
feet
to
the
fire
and
her
fingers
merrily
clicking
her
needles
together
a
very
comfortable
vision
the
kitchen
and
its
furniture
were
as
neat
as
a
pin
i
do
see
how
you
manage
mother
bartlett
diana
went
on
glancing
around
you
ought
to
have
some
one
to
live
with
you
and
help
you
it
looks
as
if
you
had
half
a
dozen
not
much
said
the
old
lady
laughing
a
half
dozen
would
soon
make
a
muss
of
one
sort
or
another
there
nothin
like
having
nobody
but
you
might
be
sick
i
might
be
but
i
ai
said
bartlett
running
one
end
of
a
under
her
cap
and
looking
placidly
at
diana
but
you
might
want
somebody
when
i
do
i
send
for
i
sent
for
you
child
and
here
you
are
but
you
are
quite
well
said
diana
a
little
anxiously
i
am
always
well
never
better
how
old
are
you
mother
bartlett
years
child
well
i
do
think
you
ought
to
be
here
alone
it
do
seem
right
and
i
do
think
it
is
right
what
to
do
child
there
ai
nary
one
to
come
and
live
with
me
they
all
gone
but
joe
my
lord
knows
i
an
old
woman
years
of
age
what
then
mother
bartlett
diana
asked
curiously
he
take
care
of
me
my
dear
but
then
we
ought
to
take
care
of
ourselves
said
diana
now
if
joe
would
marry
somebody
joe
ai
lucky
in
that
line
said
the
old
lady
laughing
again
and
may
be
what
he
might
like
i
might
before
you
go
to
wishin
for
changes
you
better
know
what
they
be
i
content
child
there
ai
a
thing
on
earth
i
want
that
i
have
got
now
what
the
news
diana
began
and
told
her
the
whole
story
of
the
sewing
meeting
and
the
accident
and
the
nursing
of
the
injured
girl
bartlett
had
an
intense
interest
in
every
particular
and
what
diana
failed
to
remember
her
questions
brought
out
and
how
do
you
like
the
new
minister
have
you
seen
him
yet
nay
he
hai
been
down
my
way
yet
in
good
time
he
will
he
had
sick
folks
to
see
arter
joe
told
me
old
jemmy
claflin
and
joe
simmons
boy
and
mis
atwood
and
eliza
i
think
you
like
him
said
diana
slowly
he
not
like
any
minister
ever
saw
what
the
odds
it
is
so
easy
to
tell
he
do
look
like
a
minister
for
one
thing
nor
he
do
talk
like
one
not
a
bit
have
we
got
a
gay
parson
then
said
the
old
lady
slightly
raising
her
eyebrows
gay
o
no
not
in
the
way
you
mean
in
one
way
he
gay
he
is
very
pleasant
not
stiff
or
grum
like
hardenburgh
and
he
is
amusing
too
in
a
quiet
way
but
he
amusing
he
is
so
cool
and
so
quick
o
no
he
not
gay
in
the
way
you
mean
i
guess
he
good
do
you
like
him
bartlett
asked
yes
said
diana
thinking
of
the
night
of
eliza
delamater
accident
he
is
very
queer
i
do
seem
to
make
him
out
by
your
telling
child
i
have
to
wait
i
guess
i
got
no
sort
of
an
idea
of
him
so
far
now
dear
if
you
set
the
table
dinner
ready
and
then
we
have
some
reading
diana
drew
out
a
small
deal
table
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
set
on
it
the
delf
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
the
little
saltcellar
of
the
same
ware
and
the
knives
and
forks
that
were
never
near
sheffield
in
fact
were
never
steel
but
the
lettuce
came
out
of
the
well
crisp
and
fresh
and
cool
and
bartlett
crust
came
out
of
the
pot
as
spongy
and
light
as
possible
and
the
loaf
of
seconds
bread
was
sweet
as
it
is
hard
for
bread
to
be
that
is
not
made
near
the
mill
and
if
you
and
i
had
been
there
i
promise
you
we
would
not
have
minded
the
knives
and
forks
or
the
cups
either
bartlett
tea
was
not
of
corresponding
quality
for
it
came
from
a
country
store
however
the
cream
went
far
to
mend
even
that
the
back
door
was
open
for
the
heat
and
the
could
be
seen
through
the
doorway
and
part
of
the
soft
green
meadow
slope
and
the
grasshopper
song
and
the
bell
tinkle
were
not
bad
music
and
who
was
that
came
with
you
dear
bartlett
asked
as
they
sat
at
table
with
me
did
you
see
me

was
in
the
garden

should
hinder
me

an
accident

into
some
trouble
with
his
horse

out

way
and

to
ask
how
he
could
get

so
i
brought
him
that
evan

a
soldier

soldier

better
o

farm

me
and

better
to
be
educated
as
he
is
and
to
know
the
world
and
all
sorts
of
things
as
he
does
than
just
to
live
on
the
farm
here
in
the
mountains
and
raise
corn
and
eat
it
and
nothing
else
is
it
why
should
it
be
better
child
it
is
nice
to
be
educated
said
diana
softly
and
she
thought
much
more
than
she
said
a
man
can
get
as
much
edication
as
he
can
hold
and
live
on
a
farm
too
i
seen
sich
some
folks
ca
do
no
better
than
hoe
corn
like
my
joe
but
there
ai
no
necessity
for
that
but
arter
all
what
does
folks
live
for
diana
i
never
could
make
out
mother
bartlett
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
and
wistfully
but
said
no
more
diana
cleared
the
table
and
washed
the
few
dishes
and
when
all
was
straight
again
took
out
a
newspaper
she
had
brought
from
home
and
she
and
the
old
lady
settled
themselves
for
an
afternoon
of
enjoyment
for
it
was
that
to
both
parties
at
home
diana
cared
little
about
the
paper
here
it
was
quite
another
thing
bartlett
wanted
to
hear
all
there
was
in
it
public
doings
foreign
doings
city
news
gossip
and
even
the
advertisements
came
in
for
their
share
of
new
inventions
had
an
interest
tokens
of
the
movements
or
the
world
wants
in
other
notices
were
found
suggestive
of
thought
or
provocative
of
wonder
sitting
with
her
feet
put
towards
the
fire
her
knitting
in
her
hands
the
quick
grey
eyes
studied
diana
face
as
she
read
never
needing
to
give
their
supervision
to
the
fingers
and
the
coarse
blue
yarn
stocking
which
was
doubtless
destined
for
joe
grew
visibly
in
length
while
the
eyes
and
thoughts
of
the
knitter
were
busy
elsewhere
the
newspaper
filled
a
good
part
of
the
afternoon
for
the
reading
was
often
interrupted
for
talk
which
grew
out
of
it
when
at
last
it
was
done
and
bartlett
eyes
returned
to
the
fire
there
were
a
few
minutes
of
stillness
then
she
said
gently
now
our
other
reading
dear
you
like
this
the
best
mother
bartlett
do
you
said
diana
as
she
rose
and
brought
from
the
inner
room
a
large
volume
book
as
any
one
might
know
at
a
glance
carefully
covered
with
a
sewn
cover
of
coarse
cloth
where
shall
i
read
now
the
place
indicated
was
the
beginning
of
the
revelation
a
favourite
book
with
the
old
lady
and
as
she
listened
the
knitting
grew
slower
though
true
to
the
instinctive
habit
of
doing
something
the
fingers
never
ceased
absolutely
their
work
but
they
moved
slowly
and
the
old
lady
eyes
no
longer
on
the
fire
went
out
of
the
open
window
and
gazed
with
a
gaze
that
went
surely
beyond
the
visible
heaven
so
wrapt
and
steady
it
was
diana
sitting
on
a
low
seat
at
her
feet
glanced
up
sometimes
but
seeing
that
gaze
looked
down
and
went
on
again
with
her
reading
and
would
not
break
the
spell
at
last
having
read
several
chapters
without
a
word
of
interruption
she
stopped
the
old
lady
eyes
came
back
to
her
knitting
which
began
to
go
a
little
faster
do
you
like
all
this
so
much
diana
asked
i
know
you
do
but
i
ca
see
why
you
do
you
ca
understand
it
i
guess
i
do
said
the
old
lady
i
seem
to
anyhow
it
queer
if
i
do
but
you
ca
make
anything
of
all
those
horses
why
it
just
what
you
been
readin
about
all
the
afternoon
in
the
newspaper

diana
it
many
a
year

the
old
lady

a
good
minister

she
spoke
dreamily
it
all
words
and
words
to
me
said
diana
there
a
blessin
belongs
to
studyin
them
words
though
those
horses
are
the
works
and
judgments
of
the
lord
that
are
goin
on
in
all
the
earth
to
prepare
the
way
of
his
comin
whose

said
the
old
lady
solemnly
the
white
horse
that
victory
that
goin
on
conquering
and
to
conquer
that
the
truth
and
power
of
the
lord
bringin
his
kingdom
the
red
horse
war
ah
how
that
red
horse
has
tramped
round
the
world
he
left
the
marks
of
his
hoofs
on
our
own
ground
not
long
sen
and
now
you

readin
to
me
about
his
goin
on
elsewhere
the
black
horse

the
minister
said
but
just
want

and
pressin
people
down
ai
there
enough
o
that
in
the
world
not
just
so
bad
in
pleasant
valley
but
all
over
and
the
pale
horse
what
is
it
the
book
calls
him
that
death
and
he
comes
to
pleasant
valley
as
he
comes
everywhere
they
been
goin
those
four
ever
sen
the
world
was
a
world
o
fallen
men
but
what
do
they
do
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
lord

said
diana
what
do
i
know
be
known
when
the
book
shall
come
to
be
read
i
i
waitin
i
know
by
and
by
only
i
can
seem
to
see
so
much
as
this
the
old
lady
went
on
after
a
pause
the
lord
wo
have
folk
to
settle
down
accordin
to
their
will
into
a
contented
forgetfulness
o
him
so
he
wo
let
there
be
peace
till
the
king
o
peace
comes
o
i
be
glad
if
he
come
but
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
world
said
diana
well
said
bartlett
it
might
be
the
end
of
the
world
for
all
i
care
if
it
would
bring
him
what
do
i
live
for
you
know
i
do
understand
you
mother
bartlett
said
diana
gently
well
what
do
you
live
for
child
i
do
know
said
diana
slowly
nothing
i
help
mother
make
butter
and
cheese
and
i
make
my
clothes
and
do
the
housework
and
next
year
it
be
the
same
thing
and
the
next
year
after
that
it
do
amount
to
anything
and
do
you
think
the
lord
made
you
you
pretty
creatur
said
the
old
lady
softly
passing
her
hand
down
the
side
of
diana
face
for
nothin
better
than
to
make
cheese
and
butter
diana
smiled
and
blushed
brightly
at
her
old
friend
a
lovely
smile
i
may
come
to
be
married
you
know
one
of
these
days
but
after
all
do
make
any
difference
it
the
same
thing
married
or
not
married
people
all
do
the
same
things
day
after
day
till
they
die
if
that
was
all
said
the
old
lady
meditatively
looking
into
the
fire
and
knitting
slowly
it
all
except
that
here
and
there
there
is
somebody
who
knows
more
and
can
do
something
better
i
suppose
life
is
something
more
to
them
but
they
are
mostly
men
edication
a
fine
thing
bartlett
went
on
in
the
same
manner
but
there
two
sorts
there
two
sorts
diana
i
hai
got
much
o
one
kind
i
never
had
no
chance
to
get
it
so
i
done
without
it
and
now
my
life
so
near
done
it
do
seem
much
matter
but
there
the
other
sort
that
ai
learned
at
no
the
lord
put
me
into
school
years
ago
where
he
puts
all
his
children
and
if
they
learn
their
lessons
he
takes
up
and
up
some
o
the
lessons
is
hard
to
learn
but
he
takes
up
and
up
till
life
ai
a
puzzle
no
longer
and
they
begin
to
know
the
language
o
heaven
where
his
courts
be
and
that
edication
that
worth
havin
when
one
just
goin
there
as
i
be
how
do
you
get
into
that
school
mother
bartlett
diana
asked
thoughtfully
and
yet
with
her
mind
not
all
upon
what
she
was
saying
you
are
in
it
my
dear
the
good
lord
sends
his
lessons
and
his
teachers
to
every
one
but
it
no
use
to
most
folks
they
wo
take
no
notice
what
said
diana
smiling
there
a
host
of
them
said
bartlett
and
of
all
sorts
why
i
seem
to
be
in
the
midst
of
diana
the
sun
is
a
teacher
to
me
every
day
and
the
clouds
and
the
air
and
the
colours
the
hill
and
the
pasture
ahint
the
house
i
learned
a
heap
of
lessons
from
and
i
learnin
all
the
time
till
i
seem
to
be
rich
with
what
tellin
me
so
rich
some
days
i
wonder
at
myself
no
doubt
to
hear
all
them
voices
one
must
hear
the
voice
o
the
word
and
then
there
many
other
voices
but
they
do
come
just
so
to
all
i
could
tell
you
some
o
mine
but
the
ones
that
come
to
you
be
sure
to
be
different
so
you
could
learn
from
child
and
folks
thinks
i
a
lonesome
old
woman
well
how
can
they
help
it
said
diana
it
said
bartlett
i
ca
help
your
seeming
so
to
me
that
for
you
had
ought
to
know
better
they
think
folks
does
i
know
i
a
poor
lone
old
woman
just
going
to
die
but
is
that
nearly
true
said
diana
gently
there
was
a
slight
glad
smile
on
the
withered
lips
as
bartlett
turned
towards
her
you
have
the
book
there
on
your
lap
dear
just
find
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
gospel
of
john
and
read
the
and
verses
and
when
you
feel
inclined
to
think
that
o
me
agin
just
wait
till
you
know
what
they
mean
diana
found
and
read
said
unto
her
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whoesoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
chapter
making
hay
june
had
changed
for
july
but
no
heats
ever
withered
the
green
of
the
pleasant
valley
hills
nor
browned
its
pastures
and
no
droughts
ever
stopped
the
tinkling
of
its
rills
and
brooks
which
rolled
down
every
one
of
them
over
gravelly
pebbly
beds
to
lose
themselves
in
lake
or
river
sun
enough
to
cure
the
hay
and
ripen
the
grain
they
had
and
july
was
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
hayfield
and
lovely
with
brown
hayricks
and
musical
with
the
whetting
of
scythes
little
farm
had
a
good
deal
of
grass
land
and
the
haying
was
proportionally
a
busy
season
for
haymakers
according
to
the
general
tradition
of
the
country
in
common
with
reapers
are
expected
to
eat
more
than
ordinary
men
or
men
in
ordinary
employments
and
to
furnish
the
meals
for
the
day
kept
both
starling
and
her
daughter
busy
it
was
sunny
perfumed
still
the
afternoon
luncheon
had
gone
out
to
the
men
who
were
cutting
then
in
the
meadow
which
surrounded
the
house
diana
found
her
hands
free
and
had
gone
up
to
her
room
not
to
rest
for
she
was
not
tired
but
to
get
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
kitchen
and
breathe
a
few
minutes
without
thinking
of
cheese
and
gingerbread
she
had
begun
to
change
her
dress
but
leisure
wooed
her
and
she
took
up
a
book
and
presently
forgot
even
that
care
in
the
delight
of
getting
into
a
region
of
for
diana
book
was
not
a
novel
few
such
found
their
way
to
pleasant
valley
and
seldom
one
to
starling
house
her
father
library
was
quite
unexhausted
still
its
volumes
took
so
long
to
read
and
needed
so
much
thinking
over
and
now
she
was
deep
in
a
treatise
more
solid
and
less
attractive
than
most
young
women
are
willing
to
read
it
carried
her
out
of
the
round
of
daily
duties
and
took
her
away
from
pleasant
valley
altogether
and
so
was
a
great
refreshment
besides
diana
liked
thinking
once
or
twice
a
creak
of
a
farm
waggon
was
heard
along
the
road
it
was
too
well
known
a
sound
to
awake
her
attention
then
came
a
sound
far
less
common
the
sharp
trot
of
a
horse
moving
without
wheels
behind
him
diana
started
instantly
and
went
to
a
window
that
commanded
the
road
the
sound
ceased
but
she
saw
why
the
rider
had
reined
in
his
steed
and
was
walking
slowly
past
the
same
rider
she
had
expected
to
see
with
the
dark
uniform
and
the
soldier
cap
he
looked
hard
at
the
place
could
he
be
stopping
the
next
moment
diana
had
flown
back
to
her
own
room
had
dropped
the
dress
which
was
half
off
and
was
arraying
herself
in
a
fresh
print
and
she
was
almost
as
soon
as
the
visitor
knocked
diana
opened
the
door
she
knew
starling
was
deep
in
supper
preparations
mingled
with
provisions
for
the
next
day
lunches
uniforms
have
a
great
effect
to
eyes
unaccustomed
to
them
how
lieut
knowlton
came
to
be
wearing
his
uniform
in
the
country
so
far
away
from
any
post
i
do
know
perhaps
he
did
he
that
he
had
nothing
else
he
liked
for
riding
in
but
a
blue
frock
with
gold
bars
across
the
shoulders
and
military
buttons
is
more
graceful
than
a
frieze
coat
and
it
was
a
gracious
graceful
head
that
was
bared
at
the
sight
of
the
you
see
he
said
with
a
smile
i
could
go
by
the
other
day
i
was
your
pensioner
in
kindness
now
i
want
to
come
in
my
own
character
if
you
let
me
is
it
different
from
the
character
i
saw
the
other
day
said
diana
as
she
led
the
way
into
the
parlour
you
did
not
see
my
character
the
other
day
did
you
i
saw
what
you
showed
me
he
laughed
and
then
laughed
again
looking
a
little
surprised
a
good
deal
amused
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
know
what
you
thought
of
me
why
would
you
diana
said
quite
quietly
that
i
might
correct
your
mistakes
of
course
suppose
i
made
any
mistakes
said
diana
you
could
only
tell
me
that
you
thought
differently
i
do
see
that
i
should
be
much
wiser
i
find
i
made
a
mistake
about
you
he
said
laughing
again
but
shaking
his
head
but
every
person
is
like
a
new
language
to
those
that
see
him
for
the
first
time
do
you
think
so
one
has
to
learn
the
signs
of
the
language
by
degrees
before
one
can
read
it
off
like
a
book
i
never
thought
about
that
said
diana
no
i
think
that
is
true
of
people
not
everybody
all
the
pleasant
valley
people
seem
to
me
to
belong
to
one
language
all
except
one
perhaps
who
is
the
exception
knowlton
asked
quickly
i
do
know
whether
you
know
him
o
i
know
everybody
here
or
i
used
to
i
was
thinking
of
somebody
who
did
use
to
be
here
he
has
only
just
come
i
mean
mr
masters
the
parson
yes
i
do
know
him
much
i
suppose
he
belongs
to
the
language
to
carry
on
our
figure
they
all
do
he
do
said
diana
that
is
what
struck
me
in
him
what
are
the
signs
of
the
language
a
black
coat
and
a
white
neckcloth
to
begin
with
he
dresses
in
grey
said
diana
laughing
or
in
white
and
wears
any
sort
of
a
cravat
to
go
on
generally
a
grave
face
and
a
manner
of
great
propriety
with
a
square
way
of
arranging
words
masters
has
no
manner
at
all
and
he
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
people
i
ever
knew
jolly
sort
eh
no
i
think
not
said
diana
i
do
know
exactly
what
you
mean
by
jolly
he
is
never
silly
and
he
does
not
laugh
much
particularly
but
he
can
make
other
people
laugh
well
another
sign
is
they
put
a
religious
varnish
over
common
things
do
you
recognise
that
i
recognise
that
for
i
have
seen
it
but
it
is
true
of
mr
masters
i
give
him
up
said
young
knowlton
i
am
sure
i
should
like
him
why
do
you
these
common
signs
of
the
language
as
you
call
it
that
you
have
been
reckoning
the
answer
was
a
decided
negative
accompanied
with
a
laugh
again
and
then
diana
visitor
turned
the
conversation
to
the
country
and
the
place
and
the
elm
trees
looked
out
of
the
window
and
observed
that
the
haymakers
were
at
work
near
the
house
and
finally
said
he
must
go
out
to
look
at
them
nearer
he
had
not
made
hay
since
he
was
a
boy
he
went
out
and
diana
went
back
to
her
mother
in
the
mother
young
knowlton
is
here
well
keep
him
out
o
way
that
all
i
ask
have
you
got
through
yet
through
there
was
but
one
single
pan
of
left
this
noon
and
there
ai
three
loaves
o
bread
in
the
pantry
what
that
among
a
tribe
o
such
grampuses
i
got
to
make
biscuits
for
tea
di
and
i
may
as
well
get
the
off
my
hands
at
the
same
time
it
be
so
much
done
for
i
wish
you
pick
over
the
berries
and
then
i
find
you
something
else
to
do
if
i
had
six
hands
and
two
heads
i
guess
i
could
about
get
along
but
mother
it
wo
do
for
nobody
to
be
in
the
parlour
i
thought
he
was
gone
only
gone
out
into
the
field
to
see
the
haymakers
queer
company
said
starling
leaving
her
bowl
of
dough
with
flowery
hands
to
peer
out
of
a
window
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
di
he
wo
come
in
again
i
declare
he
got
his
coat
off
and
gone
at
it
himself
ai
that
him
diana
looked
and
allowed
that
it
was
knowlton
had
got
a
rake
in
hand
his
coat
hung
on
the
fence
and
he
was
raking
hay
as
busily
as
the
best
of
them
diana
gave
a
little
sigh
and
turned
to
her
pan
of
berries
this
young
officer
was
a
new
language
to
her
and
she
would
have
liked
she
thought
to
spell
out
a
little
more
of
its
graceful
peculiarities
the
berries
took
a
good
while
meantime
biscuit
went
into
the
oven
and
a
sweet
smell
began
to
come
thereout
starling
bustled
about
setting
the
table
with
cold
pork
and
pickles
and
cheese
and
berry
pie
and
piles
of
bread
brown
and
white
clearly
the
haymakers
were
expected
to
supper
mother
said
diana
doubtfully
when
she
had
washed
her
hands
from
the
berry
stains
will
you
bring
knowlton
out
to
tea
if
he
should
possibly
stay
he
gone
child
this
age
no
he
is
he
ai
out
yonder
any
more
but
his
horse
stands
by
the
fence
under
the
elm
i
wish
he
was
farther
then
yes
of
course
he
come
here
if
he
takes
supper
with
i
do
think
he
will
i
do
know
him
and
i
do
know
as
i
want
to
but
this
vaguely
expressed
hope
was
disappointed
the
young
officer
came
in
a
little
while
before
supper
laughingly
asked
diana
for
some
water
to
wash
his
hands
and
followed
her
out
to
the
there
he
was
introduced
to
starling
and
informed
her
he
had
been
doing
her
work
begging
to
know
if
that
did
not
entitle
him
to
some
supper
i
think
starling
was
a
little
sorry
then
that
she
had
not
made
preparations
to
receive
him
more
elegantly
but
it
was
too
late
now
she
only
rushed
a
little
nervously
to
fetch
him
a
finer
white
towel
than
those
which
usually
did
kitchen
duty
for
herself
and
diana
and
then
the
biscuits
were
baked
and
the
farm
hands
came
streaming
in
there
were
several
of
them
now
in
haying
time
headed
by
josiah
davis
starling
ordinary
heavy
and
clumsy
warm
from
the
a
little
awkward
at
sight
of
the
company
they
filed
in
and
dropped
into
their
several
seats
round
one
end
of
the
table
and
starling
could
only
play
all
her
hospitable
arts
around
her
guest
to
make
him
forget
if
possible
his
unwonted
companions
she
served
him
assiduously
with
the
best
she
had
on
the
table
she
would
not
bring
on
any
dainties
extra
and
the
young
officer
took
kindly
even
to
the
pork
and
pickles
and
declared
the
brown
bread
was
worth
working
for
and
when
starling
let
fall
a
word
of
regretful
apology
assured
her
that
in
the
times
when
he
was
a
cadet
he
would
have
risked
getting
a
good
many
marks
for
the
sake
of
such
a
meal
what
are
the
marks
for
inquired
starling
curiously
bad
boys
he
told
her
and
then
went
off
to
a
discussion
of
her
hay
crop
and
a
dissertation
on
the
delights
of
making
hay
and
the
pleasure
he
had
had
from
it
that
afternoon
something
he
did
not
very
often
enjoy
ca
you
make
hay
anywheres
starling
asked
a
little
dryly
he
gravely
assured
her
it
would
not
be
considered
military
i
do
know
what
military
means
said
starling
are
military
ai
you
mean
to
be
he
answered
seriously
well
you
are
then
i
should
think
whatever
you
do
would
be
military
but
at
this
giving
of
judgment
after
a
minute
of
perhaps
endeavour
for
knowlton
broke
down
and
laughed
furiously
starling
looked
stern
diana
was
in
a
state
of
indecision
whether
to
laugh
with
her
friend
or
frown
with
her
mother
but
the
infection
of
fun
was
too
much
for
her
the
pretty
lips
gave
way
maybe
that
was
encouragement
for
the
offender
for
he
did
not
show
any
embarrassment
or
express
any
contrition
you
do
me
too
much
honour
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
make
his
voice
steady
you
do
me
too
much
honour
starling
i
assure
you
i
have
been
most
unmilitary
this
afternoon
but
really
i
am
no
better
than
a
boy
when
the
temptation
takes
me
and
the
temptation
of
your
meadow
and
those
long
windrows
was
too
much
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
hugely
i
am
coming
again
may
i
you
have
to
be
quick
about
it
then
said
mrs
starling
not
much
mollified
there
ai
much
more
haying
to
do
on
the
home
lot
i
guess
ai
you
done
josiah
how
said
that
worthy
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
starling
had
raised
her
voice
but
josiah
wits
always
wanted
a
knock
at
the
door
before
they
would
come
forth
to
action
hai
you
got
through
haying
not
nigh
why
what
to
do
inquired
the
mistress
with
a
new
interest
there
all
this
here
lot
to
finish
and
all
of
savin
hill
savin
hill
ai
but
half
in
grass
jes
so
there
ai
a
lock
of
it
cut
though
if
i
was
a
man
said
starling
i
believe
i
could
get
the
better
o
twenty
acres
o
hay
in
less
time
than
you
take
for
it
however
i
ai
knowlton
do
take
one
o
those
cucumbers
i
think
there
ai
a
green
pickle
equal
to
a
cucumber
when
it
tender
and
sharp
as
it
had
ought
to
be
i
am
sure
everything
under
your
hands
is
as
it
ought
to
be
said
the
young
officer
taking
the
cucumber
i
know
these
are
your
haymakers
have
a
good
time
he
added
as
the
men
rose
and
there
was
a
heavy
clangour
of
boots
and
grating
chairs
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
they
calculate
to
have
it
said
starling
and
all
through
pleasant
valley
they
do
have
it
there
are
no
poor
folks
in
the
place
and
there
ai
many
that
calls
themselves
rich
they
all
expect
to
be
comfortable
and
i
guess
most
of
be
just
the
state
of
society
in
which
there
a
sweet
little
stream
running
through
your
meadow
miss
diana
said
the
young
officer
with
a
sudden
change
of
subject
where
does
it
go
to
it
makes
a
great
many
turns
through
different
farms
and
then
joins
your
river
the
yellow
river
that
runs
round
elmfield
that
a
river
this
brook
is
just
what
i
like
i
got
tired
with
my
labours
this
afternoon
and
then
i
threw
myself
down
by
the
side
of
the
water
to
look
at
it
i
lay
there
till
i
had
almost
forgotten
what
i
was
about
not
in
your
shirt
sleeves
just
as
you
was
inquired
starling
the
inquiry
drew
another
laugh
from
her
guest
and
he
then
asked
diana
where
the
brook
came
from
if
it
was
pretty
followed
up
very
pretty
diana
said
as
soon
as
you
get
among
the
hills
and
in
the
woods
with
it
it
is
as
pretty
as
it
can
be
not
a
bit
like
what
it
is
here
full
of
rocks
and
pools
and
waterfalls
lovely
any
fish
beautiful
trout
miss
diana
can
you
fish
no
i
never
tried
well
trout
fishing
is
not
exactly
a
thing
that
comes
by
nature
i
must
go
up
that
brook
i
wish
you
would
go
and
show
me
the
way
when
i
see
anything
pretty
i
always
want
some
one
to
point
it
out
to
or
i
ca
half
enjoy
it
i
think
it
would
be
the
other
way
said
diana
i
should
be
the
one
to
show
the
brook
to
you
you
see
if
i
do
make
you
find
more
pretty
things
than
you
ever
knew
were
there
come
is
it
a
bargain
i
take
my
line
and
bring
starling
some
trout
when
said
diana
seems
to
me
said
starling
i
could
keep
along
a
brook
if
i
could
once
get
hold
of
it
ah
said
knowlton
laughing
you
are
a
great
deal
cleverer
than
i
am
you
have
no
idea
how
fast
i
can
lose
myself
miss
diana
the
sooner
the
better
while
this
lovely
weather
lasts
shall
we
say
i
be
ready
said
diana
this
weather
ai
goin
to
change
in
a
hurry
remarked
starling
but
the
remark
did
not
seem
to
be
to
the
purpose
the
appointment
was
made
for
the
following
day
at
three
and
knowlton
visit
having
come
to
an
end
he
mounted
and
galloped
away
three
said
starling
just
the
heat
o
the
day
and
trout
indeed
do
you
be
a
silly
fish
yourself
diana
mother
said
diana
i
could
help
going
when
he
asked
me
you
could
ha
helped
it
if
you
wanted
to
i
which
was
no
doubt
true
and
diana
made
no
response
for
she
wanted
to
go
she
watched
the
golden
promise
of
dawn
the
next
morning
she
watched
the
cloudless
vault
of
the
sky
and
secretly
rejoiced
within
herself
that
she
would
be
ready
chapter
vi
knowlton
fish
doubtless
they
were
ready
those
two
for
the
brook
and
the
afternoon
the
young
officer
came
at
three
not
in
regimentals
this
time
but
in
an
easy
grey
undress
and
straw
hat
he
came
in
a
waggon
and
he
brought
his
and
carried
a
basket
diana
had
been
ready
ever
since
three
they
lost
no
time
they
went
out
into
the
meadow
and
struck
the
brook
now
the
brook
during
its
passage
through
the
valley
field
was
remarkable
for
nothing
but
a
rare
infirmity
of
purpose
which
would
never
let
it
keep
one
course
for
many
rods
together
it
twisted
and
curled
about
making
many
little
meadow
promontories
on
one
side
and
the
other
hurrying
along
with
a
soft
sweet
gurgle
that
sounded
fresh
even
under
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
as
starling
had
said
and
the
two
excursionists
were
fain
to
take
it
gently
and
to
make
as
straight
a
course
across
the
fields
as
keeping
on
one
side
of
the
brook
left
possible
they
could
not
cross
it
the
stream
was
not
large
yet
quite
too
broad
for
a
jump
and
not
deep
yet
deep
enough
to
cover
its
stony
bed
and
leave
no
crossing
stones
so
sometimes
along
the
border
of
the
brook
where
a
fringe
of
long
grass
had
been
left
by
the
mowers
scythes
rank
and
tangled
sometimes
striking
across
from
bend
to
bend
over
the
meadow
where
no
kindly
trees
stood
to
shade
them
the
two
went
on
a
hunt
as
knowlton
said
after
pretty
things
after
a
mile
or
more
of
this
walking
the
scenery
changed
mown
fields
hot
and
fragrant
were
left
behind
almost
suddenly
they
entered
the
hills
where
the
brook
issued
from
them
and
then
they
began
a
slower
tracking
of
its
course
back
among
the
rocks
and
woods
of
a
dell
which
soon
grew
close
and
wild
the
sides
of
the
dell
became
higher
the
bed
of
the
stream
more
steep
and
rough
the
canopy
of
trees
closed
in
overhead
and
showed
the
blue
through
only
in
broken
patches
the
clothing
of
the
was
elegant
and
exquisite
oaks
and
firs
and
hemlocks
with
slender
birches
and
maples
lining
the
ravine
and
under
them
a
free
growth
of
ferns
and
fresh
beds
of
moss
and
lovely
lichens
covered
the
rocks
and
dressed
the
ground
the
stream
rattled
along
at
the
bottom
foaming
over
the
stones
and
leaping
down
the
rocks
making
the
still
deep
pools
where
the
fish
love
to
lie
and
in
its
way
executing
a
succession
of
cascades
and
tiny
waterfalls
that
wanted
no
picturesque
element
except
magnitude
and
a
good
imagination
can
supply
that
and
how
went
the
afternoon
how
goes
it
with
those
who
have
just
received
a
new
sense
or
found
a
sudden
doubling
of
that
which
they
had
before
nay
it
was
a
new
sense
a
new
power
of
perception
able
to
discern
what
had
eluded
all
their
previous
lives
the
brook
in
the
meadow
had
been
to
diana
vision
until
now
merely
running
water
whence
had
come
those
delicious
amber
hues
where
it
rolled
over
the
stones
and
the
deep
olive
shadows
where
the
water
was
deeper
she
had
never
seen
them
before
now
they
were
pointed
out
and
seen
to
be
rich
and
clear
a
sort
of
dilution
of
sunlight
with
a
suggestion
of
sunlight
other
riches
of
possibility
the
rank
unmown
grass
that
fringed
the
stream
diana
had
never
seen
it
but
as
what
the
scythe
had
missed
now
she
was
made
to
notice
what
an
elegant
fringe
it
was
and
how
the
same
sunlight
glanced
upon
its
curving
stems
and
blades
and
set
off
the
deep
brown
stream
diana
own
eyes
began
to
be
quickened
and
her
tongue
loosed
the
lovely
outline
of
the
hills
that
encircled
the
valley
had
never
looked
just
so
rare
and
lovely
as
this
afternoon
when
she
pointed
them
out
to
her
companion
and
he
scanned
them
and
nodded
in
full
assent
but
when
they
got
into
the
ravine
it
was
diana
turn
mosses
and
old
trees
and
sharp
turns
of
the
gorge
and
fords
where
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
brook
and
recross
on
stepping
stones
just
lifting
them
above
the
water
here
black
enough
diana
knew
all
these
things
and
with
secret
delight
unfolded
the
knowledge
of
them
to
her
companion
as
they
went
along
and
still
the
bits
of
blue
sky
overhead
had
never
seemed
so
unearthly
blue
the
drapery
of
oak
and
hemlock
boughs
had
never
been
so
graceful
and
bright
there
was
a
presence
in
the
old
gorge
that
afternoon
which
went
with
them
and
cleared
their
eyes
from
vapour
and
their
minds
from
everything
it
seemed
but
a
susceptibility
to
beauty
and
delight
in
its
influence
perhaps
the
young
officer
would
have
said
that
this
presence
was
embodied
in
the
unconscious
eyes
and
fair
calm
brow
which
went
beside
him
i
think
he
saw
them
more
distinctly
than
anything
else
diana
did
not
know
it
somehow
she
very
rarely
looked
her
companion
in
the
face
and
yet
she
knew
very
well
how
his
face
looked
too
so
well
perhaps
that
she
did
not
need
to
refresh
her
memory
so
they
wandered
on
and
the
fords
were
pleasant
places
where
she
had
to
be
helped
over
the
stones
not
that
diana
needed
such
help
her
foot
was
fearless
and
true
she
never
had
had
help
there
before
was
that
what
made
it
so
pleasant
certainly
it
did
seem
to
her
that
it
was
a
prettier
way
of
going
up
the
brook
than
alone
and
unaided
i
am
not
getting
much
fish
at
this
rate
said
young
knowlton
at
length
with
a
light
laugh
no
said
diana
why
do
you
stop
and
try
here
here
looks
like
a
good
place
right
in
that
still
deep
spot
i
dare
say
there
are
trout
what
will
you
do
in
the
meantime
if
i
stop
and
fish
it
will
be
very
stupid
for
you
for
me
o
no
i
shall
sit
here
and
look
on
it
will
not
be
stupid
i
will
keep
still
never
fear
i
do
want
you
to
keep
still
that
would
be
very
stupid
for
me
you
ca
talk
while
you
are
fishing
it
would
scare
the
trout
you
know
i
do
believe
it
i
have
always
heard
so
i
do
believe
it
will
pay
said
knowlton
as
he
fitted
his
rod
if
i
am
to
purchase
trout
at
the
expense
of
all
that
all
what
diana
wondered
suppose
we
talk
very
softly
in
whispers
he
went
on
laughing
do
you
suppose
the
trout
are
so
observant
as
to
mind
it
if
you
sit
here
on
this
mossy
stone
close
by
me
ca
i
enjoy
two
things
at
once
diana
made
no
objection
to
this
arrangement
she
took
the
place
indicated
full
of
a
breathless
kind
of
pleasure
which
she
did
not
stop
to
analyze
and
watched
in
silence
the
progress
of
the
fishing
in
silence
for
after
knowlton
arrangement
had
been
carried
into
effect
he
too
subsided
into
stillness
whether
engrossed
with
the
business
of
his
line
or
satisfied
or
with
thoughts
otherwise
engaged
did
not
appear
but
as
presently
and
again
a
large
trout
speckled
and
beautiful
was
swung
up
out
of
the
pool
below
the
two
faces
were
turned
towards
each
other
and
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
with
a
smile
of
so
much
sympathy
that
i
rather
think
the
temporary
absence
of
words
lost
nothing
to
the
growth
of
the
understanding
between
them
the
place
where
they
sat
was
lovely
just
there
the
bank
was
high
overhanging
the
brook
a
projecting
rock
brown
and
green
and
grey
with
lichen
and
mosses
of
various
kinds
held
besides
a
delicate
young
silver
birch
the
roots
of
which
found
their
way
to
nourishment
somehow
through
fissures
in
the
rock
here
sat
knowlton
with
diana
beside
him
on
a
stone
just
a
little
behind
while
he
sat
on
the
brink
to
cast
or
rather
drop
his
line
into
the
little
pool
below
where
the
trout
were
lurking
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
was
but
a
few
yards
off
thick
with
a
lovely
growth
of
young
wood
with
one
great
hemlock
not
far
above
towering
up
towards
the
sky
the
view
in
that
direction
went
up
a
vista
of
the
ravine
so
on
both
sides
with
the
stream
leaping
and
tumbling
down
a
steep
rocky
bed
overhead
the
narrow
line
of
blue
sky
four
whispered
diana
as
another
spotted
trout
came
up
from
the
pool
i
wonder
how
many
there
are
down
there
said
knowlton
as
he
unhooked
the
fish
it
makes
me
hungry
catching
the
trout
said
diana
softly
he
nodded
here
comes
another
i
wish
we
could
make
a
fire
somewhere
hereabouts
and
cook
them
is
that
a
good
way
the
best
in
the
world
he
said
adjusting
his
fly
and
then
looking
with
a
smile
at
her
there
is
no
way
that
fish
taste
so
good
i
used
to
do
that
you
see
in
the
hills
round
about
the
academy
and
i
know
all
about
it
we
could
make
a
fire
said
diana
but
we
have
no
gridiron
here
i
had
no
gridiron
there
could
have
carried
a
gridiron
in
my
pocket
if
i
had
had
one
here
another
you
had
not
a
gridiron
of
course
nor
a
pocket
either
but
did
you
eat
the
trout
all
alone
without
bread
i
mean
or
anything
no
we
took
bread
and
salt
and
pepper
and
butter
and
a
few
such
things
there
were
generally
a
lot
of
us
or
if
only
two
or
three
we
could
manage
that
the
butter
was
the
worst
thing
to
accomplish
another
such
beauties
said
diana
well
knowlton
if
you
get
hungry
we
cook
you
one
at
home
you
know
will
you
said
he
i
wish
we
had
salt
and
bread
here
i
should
like
to
show
you
how
wood
cookery
goes
though
but
i
tell
you
we
get
starling
to
let
us
have
it
out
in
the
meadow
that
wo
be
bad
diana
thought
of
her
mother
utter
astonishment
and
disapprobation
at
such
a
proposal
and
there
was
silence
again
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
line
hung
motionless
over
the
pool
and
diana
eyes
watched
it
movelessly
and
the
liquid
sweetness
of
the
water
talk
with
the
stones
was
heard
as
one
hears
things
when
the
senses
are
strung
to
double
keenness
diana
heard
it
at
least
and
listened
to
something
in
it
she
had
never
perceived
before
something
not
only
sweet
and
liquid
and
musical
but
in
some
odd
sense
admonitory
what
did
it
say
diana
hardly
questioned
but
yet
she
heard
my
peace
never
changes
my
song
never
dies
listen
or
not
listen
it
is
all
the
same
you
may
be
in
twenty
moods
in
a
year
in
my
depth
of
content
i
flow
on
for
ever
a
slight
rustling
of
leaves
a
slight
crackling
of
stems
or
branches
brought
the
eyes
of
both
watchers
in
another
direction
and
before
they
could
hear
a
footfall
they
saw
above
them
on
the
course
of
the
brook
a
figure
of
a
man
coming
towards
them
and
diana
knew
it
was
the
minister
swiftly
and
lightly
he
came
swinging
himself
along
bounding
over
obstacles
with
a
sure
foot
and
a
strong
hand
till
presently
he
stood
beside
them
just
then
knowlton
line
was
swung
up
with
another
trout
diana
introduced
the
gentlemen
to
each
other
fishing
said
the
minister
we
have
got
all
there
are
in
this
place
i
thinking
said
knowlton
shutting
up
his
rod
you
not
two
minutes
ago
said
the
other
what
do
you
judge
from
it
does
do
to
be
so
easily
discouraged
as
that
discouraged
said
knowlton
not
exactly
let
us
see
four
five
six
seven
eight
eight
out
of
this
little
one
pool
masters
do
you
think
there
are
any
more
i
always
get
all
i
can
out
of
a
thing
said
the
minister
and
his
very
cheery
tone
as
well
as
his
very
quiet
manner
seemed
to
say
he
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
a
good
deal
out
of
everything
i
do
know
about
that
answered
the
young
officer
in
another
tone
does
always
pay
to
stay
too
long
at
one
pool
of
a
brook
for
instance
the
brook
has
other
pools
i
suppose
i
suppose
it
has
said
the
minister
with
a
manner
which
would
have
puzzled
any
but
one
that
knew
him
to
tell
whether
he
were
in
jest
or
earnest
i
suppose
it
has
but
you
may
not
find
them
or
by
the
time
you
do
you
may
have
lost
your
bait
or
you
may
be
tired
of
fishing
or
it
may
be
time
to
go
home
i
am
never
tired
said
knowlton
springing
up
and
i
have
got
a
guide
that
will
not
let
me
miss
my
way
you
are
fortunate
said
the
other
and
i
will
not
occupy
your
time
good
afternoon
i
shall
hope
to
see
more
of
you
with
a
warm
grasp
of
the
young
officer
hand
and
lifting
his
hat
to
diana
the
minister
went
on
his
way
diana
looked
after
him
wondering
why
he
had
not
shaken
hands
with
her
too
it
was
something
she
was
a
little
sorry
to
miss
who
is
that
knowlton
asked
masters
he
our
minister
what
sort
of
a
chap
is
he
not
like
all
the
rest
of
them
how
are
all
the
rest
of
them
diana
asked
i
declare
i
do
know
said
knowlton
if
i
was
to
tell
the
truth
i
should
say
they
puzzle
all
my
wits
see
in
one
place
and
hear
and
you
would
say
they
thought
all
the
business
of
this
world
was
of
no
account
nor
the
pleasure
of
it
either
see
anywhere
else
and
they
are
just
as
much
of
this
world
as
you
are
or
as
i
am
i
mean
they
change
as
fast
as
a
chameleon
in
the
light
that
comes
through
a
church
window
now
they
be
blue
enough
and
make
you
think
the
only
wear
or
black
but
once
outside
and
they
like
the
colour
that
comes
through
a
glass
of
wine
or
anything
also
that
jolly
one
thing
or
the
other
they
do
mean
that
plain
which
do
you
think
they
do
mean
said
diana
well
they
two
or
three
hours
in
church
and
the
rest
of
the
week
outside
i
believe
what
they
say
the
rest
of
the
time
i
do
think
masters
is
like
that
what
he
like
then
i
think
he
means
exactly
what
he
says
exactly
said
the
young
officer
laughing
but
which
part
of
the
time
you
know
all
times
i
think
he
means
just
the
same
thing
always
must
see
more
of
him
said
knowlton
you
like
him
then
miss
starling
diana
did
like
him
and
it
was
quite
her
way
to
say
what
she
thought
yet
she
did
not
say
it
she
had
an
undefined
shadowy
impression
that
the
hearing
would
not
be
grateful
to
her
companion
her
reply
was
a
very
inconclusive
remark
that
she
had
not
seen
much
of
masters
and
an
inquiry
where
knowlton
meant
to
fish
next
so
the
brook
had
them
without
interruption
the
rest
of
the
time
they
crept
up
the
ravine
under
the
hemlock
branches
and
oak
boughs
picking
their
way
along
the
rocky
banks
catching
one
or
two
more
trout
and
finding
an
unending
supply
of
things
to
talk
about
while
the
air
grew
more
delicious
as
the
day
dipped
towards
evening
and
the
light
flashed
from
the
upper
more
clear
and
sparkling
as
the
rays
came
more
slant
and
the
brook
running
commentary
on
what
was
going
on
like
so
many
other
commentaries
was
heard
and
not
heeded
until
the
shadows
deepening
in
the
dell
warned
them
it
was
time
to
seek
the
lower
grounds
and
open
fields
again
which
they
did
much
more
swiftly
than
the
ascent
of
the
brook
had
been
made
in
great
spirits
on
both
sides
though
with
a
thought
on
diana
part
how
her
mother
would
receive
the
fish
and
the
young
officer
proposition
starling
was
standing
at
the
back
door
of
the
kitchen
as
they
came
up
to
it
i
should
think
diana
you
knew
enough
to
remember
that
we
do
take
visitors
in
at
this
end
of
the
house
was
her
opening
remark
how
about
fish
inquired
knowlton
bringing
forward
his
basket
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
asked
starling
standing
in
the
door
as
if
she
meant
he
should
not
come
in
we
are
going
to
eat
them
with
your
leave
and
by
your
help
and
first
we
are
going
to
cook
them
who
miss
starling
and
myself
i
have
promised
to
show
her
a
thing
may
i
ask
for
the
loan
of
a
match
a
match
echoed
starling
or
two
added
knowlton
with
an
indescribable
twinkle
in
his
eye
indescribable
because
there
was
nothing
contrary
to
good
breeding
in
it
all
the
more
diana
felt
the
sense
of
fun
it
expressed
and
hastened
to
change
the
scene
and
put
an
end
to
the
colloquy
she
threw
down
her
bonnet
and
went
for
a
handful
of
sticks
knowlton
had
got
his
match
by
this
time
starling
stood
astonished
and
scornful
will
this
be
wood
enough
diana
asked
knowlton
replied
by
taking
the
sticks
out
of
her
hand
and
led
the
way
into
the
meadow
diana
followed
very
quiet
and
flushed
he
had
not
said
a
word
yet
the
manner
of
that
little
action
had
a
whole
small
volume
in
it
nobody
else
ever
cared
whether
i
had
sticks
in
my
hands
or
not
thought
diana
and
she
flushed
more
and
more
she
turned
her
face
away
from
the
bright
west
which
threw
too
much
illumination
on
it
and
looked
down
into
the
brook
the
brook
song
sounded
now
unheard
it
was
on
the
border
of
the
brook
that
lieut
knowlton
made
his
fire
he
was
in
a
very
jubilant
sort
of
mood
the
fire
was
made
and
the
fish
were
washed
and
diana
stood
by
the
column
of
smoke
in
the
meadow
and
looked
on
as
still
as
a
mouse
and
starling
stood
in
the
door
of
the
and
looked
on
too
from
a
distance
and
if
she
was
still
it
was
because
she
had
no
one
near
just
then
to
whom
it
was
safe
to
open
her
mind
the
beauty
of
the
picture
was
all
lost
upon
her
the
shorn
meadow
the
soft
column
of
ascending
smoke
coloured
in
dainty
hues
from
the
glowing
western
sky
the
two
figures
moving
about
it
now
miss
diana
said
the
young
officer
if
we
had
a
little
salt
and
a
dish
i
am
afraid
to
go
and
ask
starling
for
them
perhaps
so
was
she
but
diana
went
and
got
them
without
asking
she
smiled
at
the
dishing
of
the
trout
it
was
so
cleverly
done
then
she
was
requested
to
sprinkle
salt
on
them
herself
and
then
with
a
satisfied
air
which
somehow
called
up
a
flush
in
diana
cheeks
again
knowlton
marched
off
to
the
house
with
the
dish
in
his
hands
starling
had
given
her
farm
labourers
their
supper
and
was
clearing
away
relics
from
the
board
she
made
no
move
of
welcome
or
hospitable
invitation
but
diana
hastened
to
remove
the
traces
of
disorder
and
set
clean
plates
and
cups
and
bring
fresh
butter
and
bread
and
make
fresh
tea
how
very
pleasant
and
how
extremely
unpleasant
it
was
altogether
mother
she
said
when
all
was
ready
wo
you
come
and
taste
knowlton
fish
i
guess
i
know
how
fish
taste
i
have
eaten
the
trout
of
that
brook
all
my
life
without
but
you
do
know
my
cookery
said
knowlton
something
new
i
do
see
the
sense
of
doing
things
in
an
outlandish
way
when
you
have
no
need
to
nor
i
do
see
why
men
should
cook
as
long
as
there
women
about
what
outlandish
inquired
knowlton
what
you
been
doing
i
should
say
come
and
try
my
cookery
starling
you
will
never
say
anything
against
men
in
that
capacity
again
i
never
say
anything
against
men
anyhow
only
against
men
cooking
and
that
ai
natural
it
comes
quite
natural
to
me
said
the
young
officer
only
taste
my
trout
starling
and
you
will
be
quite
reconciled
to
me
again
i
ai
quarrelling
with
nobody
fur
i
know
said
starling
but
i
had
my
supper
well
we
have
had
ours
said
the
young
man
and
he
set
himself
not
only
to
supply
that
deficiency
in
his
own
case
but
to
secure
that
diana
should
enjoy
and
eat
hers
in
spite
of
all
hindrances
he
saw
that
she
was
wofully
annoyed
by
her
mother
manner
it
brought
out
his
own
more
in
contrast
than
perhaps
otherwise
would
have
been
he
helped
her
he
coaxed
her
he
praised
the
trout
and
the
tea
and
the
bread
and
the
butter
he
peppered
and
salted
anew
when
he
thought
it
necessary
on
her
own
plate
and
he
talked
and
told
stories
and
laughed
and
made
her
laugh
till
even
starling
moving
about
in
the
pantry
moved
softly
and
set
down
the
dishes
carefully
that
she
too
might
hear
diana
sometimes
knew
that
she
did
so
at
other
times
was
fain
to
forget
everything
but
the
glamour
of
the
moment
trout
were
disposed
of
at
last
however
and
the
remainder
was
cold
bread
and
butter
had
done
its
duty
and
knowlton
rose
from
table
his
adieux
were
gay
quite
unaffected
by
starling
determined
holding
aloof
and
involuntarily
diana
stood
by
the
table
where
she
could
look
out
of
the
window
till
she
had
seen
him
mount
into
his
waggon
and
go
off
have
you
got
through
said
starling
supper
said
diana
starting
yes
mother
then
perhaps
i
can
have
a
chance
now
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
world
to
do
or
is
it
all
done
up
in
the
world
you
have
got
into
diana
began
clearing
away
the
relics
of
the
trout
supper
in
silence
and
with
all
haste
that
ai
all
said
starling
the
house
do
stand
still
for
nobody
nor
the
world
nor
things
generally
the
sponge
has
got
to
be
set
for
the
bread
and
there
the
beans
diana
the
day
for
the
beans
and
they
ai
looked
over
yet
nor
put
in
soak
and
you
better
get
out
some
codfish
and
put
that
on
the
stove
i
know
what
to
have
for
breakfast
if
i
do
have
that
you
best
go
and
get
off
your
dress
first
thing
that
my
counsel
to
ye
and
save
washing
diana
went
into
no
reasoning
on
that
subject
or
any
other
but
she
managed
to
do
all
that
was
demanded
of
her
without
changing
her
dress
and
yet
without
damaging
its
fresh
neatness
in
silence
and
in
an
uncomfortable
mute
antagonism
which
each
one
felt
in
every
movement
of
the
other
odd
it
is
that
when
words
for
any
reason
are
restrained
the
feeling
supposed
to
be
kept
back
manifests
itself
in
the
turn
of
the
shoulders
and
the
set
of
the
head
in
the
putting
down
of
the
foot
or
the
raising
of
the
hand
nay
in
the
harmless
movements
of
pans
and
kettles
the
work
was
done
however
punctually
as
always
in
that
house
though
diana
feeling
of
mingled
resentment
and
shame
grew
as
the
evening
wore
on
she
was
glad
when
the
last
pan
was
lifted
for
the
last
time
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
door
of
the
and
she
and
her
mother
moved
into
the
other
part
of
the
house
preparatory
to
seeking
their
several
rooms
but
starling
had
not
done
her
work
yet
when
that
young
man
comin
again
she
asked
abruptly
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
stopping
to
trim
the
wick
of
her
candle
and
looking
into
the
light
without
winking
i
do
know
diana
faltered
i
do
know
that
he
is
ever
coming
again
do
expect
him
either
do
you
i
think
it
would
be
odd
if
he
did
said
diana
bravely
after
a
moment
hesitation
odd
why
diana
hesitated
longer
this
time
and
the
words
did
not
come
for
her
waiting
why
odd
repeated
starling
sharply
when
people
seem
to
like
a
place
they
are
apt
to
come
again
said
diana
flushing
a
little
said
starling
now
diana
i
have
just
this
one
thing
to
say
do
you
go
and
give
that
young
fellow
no
encouragement
encouragement
mother
repeated
diana
yes
encouragement
do
you
give
him
any
mind
my
words
if
you
do
i
wo
but
mother
said
diana
what
is
there
to
encourage
i
could
not
help
going
to
show
the
brook
to
him
you
could
said
starling
beginning
to
mount
the
stairs
well
it
is
good
to
practise
he
asked
you
to
let
him
show
you
the
mississippi
or
the
pacific
ocean
could
you
help
that
mother
i
am
ashamed
said
poor
diana
just
think
he
is
educated
and
has
every
advantage
and
is
an
officer
in
the
united
states
army
now
and
what
am
i
worth
three
dozen
of
him
said
starling
decidedly
he
would
think
so
mother
nor
anybody
else
but
you
well
think
so
mind
and
that
enough
i
ai
a
goin
to
give
you
to
him
not
if
he
was
fifty
officers
in
the
united
states
army
so
keep
my
words
diana
and
mind
what
i
say
i
never
will
give
you
to
him
nor
to
any
other
man
that
calls
himself
a
soldier
and
looks
down
upon
folks
that
are
better
than
he
is
i
wo
let
you
marry
him
so
do
you
go
and
tell
him
you
will
he
wo
ask
me
mother
you
make
me
ashamed
said
diana
with
her
cheeks
burning
but
i
am
sure
he
does
not
look
down
upon
me
nobody
shall
marry
you
that
sets
himself
up
above
me
said
starling
as
she
closed
her
door
mind
and
diana
went
into
her
own
room
and
shut
her
door
and
sat
down
to
breathe
suppose
he
should
ask
you
to
let
him
show
you
the
mississippi
or
the
pacific
and
the
hot
flush
rushed
over
her
and
she
hid
her
face
as
if
even
from
herself
he
will
not
but
what
if
he
should
starling
had
raised
the
question
diana
in
very
maidenly
shame
tried
to
beat
it
down
and
stamp
the
life
out
of
it
but
that
was
more
than
she
could
do
chapter
vii
belles
and
blackberries
in
the
first
flush
of
diana
distress
that
night
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
the
sight
of
lieut
knowlton
in
all
time
to
come
could
but
give
her
additional
distress
how
could
she
look
at
him
but
the
clear
morning
light
found
her
nerves
quiet
again
and
her
cheeks
cool
and
a
certain
sweet
in
which
she
held
herself
always
forbade
any
such
flutter
of
vanity
or
stir
even
of
fancy
as
could
in
any
wise
ruffle
the
simple
dignity
of
this
country
girl
manner
she
had
no
careful
mother
training
or
father
watch
and
safeguard
the
artificial
rules
of
propriety
were
still
less
known
to
her
but
innate
purity
and
modesty
and
as
i
said
the
poise
of
a
true
new
england
stood
her
in
better
stead
when
diana
saw
knowlton
the
next
time
she
was
conscious
of
no
discomposure
and
was
struck
with
the
placid
elegance
of
manner
formed
in
no
school
which
was
the
very
outgrowth
of
the
truth
within
her
his
own
manner
grew
unconsciously
deferential
it
is
the
most
flattering
homage
a
man
can
render
a
woman
starling
had
delivered
her
mind
and
thereafter
she
was
content
to
be
very
civil
to
him
further
than
that
a
true
record
can
not
go
the
young
officer
tried
to
negotiate
himself
into
her
good
graces
he
was
attentive
and
respectful
and
made
himself
entertaining
and
starling
was
entertained
and
entertained
him
also
on
her
part
and
diana
watched
for
a
word
of
favourable
comment
or
better
judgment
of
him
when
he
was
gone
none
ever
came
and
diana
sometimes
sighed
when
she
and
her
mother
had
shut
the
doors
as
that
night
upon
each
other
for
to
mind
the
favourable
comments
rose
unasked
for
he
came
very
often
on
one
pretext
or
another
he
began
to
be
very
much
at
home
his
eye
used
to
meet
her
as
something
he
had
been
looking
for
and
had
just
found
and
the
lingering
clasp
of
his
hand
said
the
touch
was
pleasant
generally
their
interviews
were
in
the
parlour
of
diana
home
sometimes
he
contrived
an
occasion
to
get
her
to
drive
with
him
or
to
walk
and
diana
never
found
that
she
could
refuse
herself
the
pleasure
or
need
refuse
it
to
him
the
country
was
so
thinly
settled
and
their
excursions
had
as
yet
been
in
such
lonely
places
that
no
village
eyes
or
tongues
had
been
aroused
so
the
depth
of
august
came
the
two
were
standing
one
moonlight
night
at
the
little
front
gate
lingering
in
the
moonlight
knowlton
was
going
and
could
not
go
have
you
heard
anything
about
the
bear
hill
party
he
asked
suddenly
o
yes
miss
delamater
came
here
a
week
ago
to
speak
about
it
are
you
going
mother
said
she
would
so
i
suppose
i
shall
where
is
it
and
what
is
it
the
place
bear
hill
is
a
very
wild
stony
bare
hill
at
least
one
side
of
it
is
bare
the
other
side
is
covered
with
trees
and
the
bare
side
is
covered
with
blackberry
bushes
the
largest
you
ever
saw
and
the
berries
are
the
largest
we
always
go
there
every
summer
a
number
of
us
out
of
pleasant
valley
to
get
blackberries
how
far
is
it
fifteen
miles
that
a
good
way
to
go
said
the
young
man
smiling
people
hereabouts
must
be
very
fond
of
that
fruit
we
want
them
for
a
great
many
uses
you
know
it
is
just
to
eat
them
mother
makes
jam
and
wine
for
the
whole
year
besides
what
we
eat
at
once
and
we
go
for
the
fun
too
as
well
as
for
the
berries
so
it
is
fun
is
it
i
think
so
we
make
a
day
of
it
and
everybody
carries
provisions
and
we
build
a
fire
and
it
is
very
pleasant
i
go
said
knowlton
i
have
heard
something
about
it
at
home
they
wanted
me
to
drive
them
but
i
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
engaging
myself
to
well
i
be
there
and
i
take
care
our
waggon
carries
its
stock
of
supplies
too
thursday
is
it
i
believe
so
what
time
shall
you
go
about
eight
or
said
the
young
officer
i
shall
have
to
revive
academy
habits
i
am
grown
lazy
the
days
are
so
warm
you
know
diana
explained
and
we
have
to
come
home
early
we
always
have
dinner
between
twelve
and
one
i
see
said
the
young
man
i
see
the
necessity
and
feel
the
difficulty
well
i
be
there
he
grasped
her
hand
again
they
had
shaken
hands
before
he
left
the
house
diana
remembered
and
this
time
he
held
her
fingers
in
a
light
clasp
for
some
seconds
after
it
was
time
to
let
them
go
then
he
turned
and
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
went
off
at
a
gallop
diana
stood
still
at
the
gate
where
he
had
left
her
looking
down
the
road
and
listening
to
the
diminishing
sound
of
his
horse
hoofs
the
moonlight
streamed
tenderly
down
upon
her
and
the
elm
trees
it
filled
the
empty
space
where
knowlton
figure
had
been
it
flickered
where
the
elm
branches
stirred
lightly
and
cast
broken
shadows
upon
the
ground
it
poured
its
floods
of
effulgence
over
the
meadows
and
distant
hills
in
still
moveless
peace
and
power
of
everlasting
calm
it
was
one
of
the
minutes
of
diana
life
that
she
never
forgot
afterwards
a
point
where
her
life
had
stood
still
still
as
the
moonlight
and
almost
as
sweet
in
its
broad
restfulness
she
lingered
at
the
gate
and
came
slowly
back
again
into
the
house
what
are
you
going
to
take
to
bear
hill
mother
inquired
diana
the
next
day
i
do
know
i
declare
i
tired
of
picnics
they
cost
more
than
they
come
to

we
could

and
go
off
by
ourselves
early
some
morning
and
get
what
we
want

some
fun
in
that
it

very
lonely
place

diana

or

my

the
smoke
and
bear
hill
wo

off
then
bear
hill
did
come
off
however
early
on
the
morning
of
thursday
josiah
might
be
seen
loading
up
the
little
green
waggon
with
tin
kettles
and
baskets
both
empty
and
full
ears
of
corn
went
in
too
for
the
idee
had
struck
starling
favourably
and
an
iron
pot
found
its
way
into
one
corner
breakfast
was
despatched
in
haste
the
house
locked
up
and
the
key
put
under
the
for
josiah
to
find
at
noon
and
the
two
ladies
mounted
and
drove
away
while
the
morning
light
was
yet
fresh
and
cool
and
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lay
long
in
the
meadow
august
mornings
and
evenings
were
seldom
hotter
than
was
agreeable
in
pleasant
valley
for
some
miles
the
road
lay
through
the
region
so
denominated
then
it
entered
the
hills
and
soon
the
way
led
over
them
up
and
down
steep
ascents
and
pitches
with
a
green
woodland
on
each
side
and
often
a
over
some
little
meadow
valley
of
level
fields
and
cultivation
bordered
and
encircled
by
more
hills
the
drive
was
a
silent
one
starling
held
the
reins
and
perhaps
they
gave
her
thoughts
employment
enough
diana
was
musing
about
another
waggonful
and
wondering
whereabouts
it
was
till
at
a
turn
of
the
road
she
discerned
behind
them
at
some
distance
a
vehicle
coming
along
and
knew
with
a
jump
of
her
heart
the
colour
of
the
horse
and
the
figure
of
the
driver
even
so
far
off
she
was
sure
of
them
and
turned
her
to
look
straight
forward
again
hoping
that
her
mother
might
not
by
any
chance
give
a
look
back
she
did
not
herself
again
but
diana
ears
were
watching
all
the
while
after
that
for
the
sound
of
hoofs
or
wheels
coming
near
and
her
eyes
served
her
to
see
nothing
but
what
was
out
of
her
field
of
vision
the
scenery
grew
by
degrees
rough
and
wild
cultivation
and
civilisation
seemed
as
they
went
on
to
fall
into
the
rear
a
village
or
hamlet
of
miserable
dirty
uncomely
houses
and
people
was
passed
by
and
at
last
just
as
the
morning
was
wakening
up
into
fervour
starling
drew
rein
in
a
desolate
rough
spot
at
the
edge
of
a
woodland
the
regular
road
had
been
left
some
time
before
since
when
only
an
uncertain
wheel
track
had
marked
the
way
two
or
three
farm
waggons
already
stood
at
the
place
of
meeting
nobody
was
in
them
the
last
comer
was
just
hitching
his
horse
to
a
tree
here
mis
starling
he
called
out
good
day
to
hold
on
mis
starling
i
fetch
him
up
goin
to
conquer
all
bear
hill
ai
ye
with
all
them
pails
and
kettles
wall
blackberries
ripe
but
once
in
the
year
i
left
all
business
to
attend
upon
the
women
folks
what
blackberries

for
now
when
you
got
do
you
like
a
blackberry
pie
mr
selden

said
the
farmer
i
kin
live
without
it
but
my
folks
ca
live
comin
once
a
year
to
bear
hill
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
why
things
war
so
ordered
as
that
folks
could
get
along
eatin
it
save
a
sight
o
trouble
why
mis
starlin
we
all
the
time
to
fill
our
stomachs
come
to
think
of
it
that
pretty
much
what
life
is
fur
now
i
warrant
you
they
have
a
spread
by
and
by
that
be
worth
all
they
get
here
who
come
mr
selden
wall
they
ai
all
here
yet
i
guess

in
the
lot

mis
seelye
gals
is
here
and
bill
howe
and
his
wife
and
the
delamaters
that
all
i
guess
he
safe
now
starlin
this
last
remark
had
reference
to
the
horse
which
farmer
selden
had
been
taking
out
of
the
shafts
and
tethering
after
helping
the
ladies
down
starling
got
out
her
pails
and
baskets
destined
for
the
and
gave
some
of
them
to
her
daughter
they
be
all
flocking
together
up
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
lot
she
whispered
now
diana
if
you
sheer
off
a
little
kind
o
and
keep
out
o
sight
you
have
a
ventur
and
we
can
stand
a
chance
to
get
home
early
after
dinner
i
go
along
ahead
and
keep
from
comin
where
you
are
if
i
can
diana
heard
with
tingling
ears
for
she
heard
at
the
same
time
the
sound
of
the
approaching
waggon
behind
her
she
did
not
look
she
caught
up
her
pail
and
basket
and
plunged
into
the
wood
path
after
her
mother
and
selden
but
she
had
not
gone
three
yards
when
she
heard
her
name
called
you
are
not
going
to
desert
us
cried
young
knowlton
coming
up
with
her
we
do
know
a
step
of
the
way
nor
where
to
find
blackberries
or
anything
i
have
been
piloting
myself
all
the
way
by
your
waggon
come
back
and
let
me
make
you
friends
with
my
sister
blushing
and
hesitating
diana
had
yet
no
choice
she
followed
knowlton
back
to
the
clearing
and
looked
on
feeling
partly
pleased
and
partly
uncomfortable
while
he
helped
from
their
waggon
the
ladies
he
had
driven
to
the
picnic
the
first
one
dismounted
was
a
beautiful
vision
to
diana
eyes
a
trim
little
figure
robed
in
a
dress
almost
white
with
small
crimson
clusters
sprinkled
over
it
coral
buckle
and
earrings
a
wide
leghorn
hat
with
red
ribbons
and
curly
luxuriant
long
floating
waves
of
hair
she
was
so
pretty
and
her
attire
was
so
graceful
and
had
so
jaunty
a
style
about
it
that
diana
was
struck
somehow
with
a
fresh
though
very
undefined
feeling
of
uneasiness
she
turned
to
the
other
lady
very
pretty
she
was
too
smaller
even
than
the
first
one
with
delicate
piquant
features
and
a
ready
smile
daintily
she
also
was
dressed
in
some
stuff
of
deep
green
colour
which
set
her
off
as
its
encompassing
foliage
does
a
bunch
of
cherries
her
face
looked
out
almost
like
one
it
was
so
blooming
from
the
shadow
of
a
green
silk
and
her
hands
were
cased
in
green
kid
gloves
her
eyes
sought
diana
my
sister
reverdy
said
young
knowlton
eagerly
leading
her
forward
miss
starling
genevieve
you
know
who
miss
starling
is
the
little
lady
answer
was
most
gracious
she
smiled
winningly
and
grasped
diana
hand
and
was
delighted
to
know
her
and
we
are
so
glad
to
meet
you
for
we
are
strangers
here
you
know
i
never
was
at
bear
hill
in
my
life
but
they
told
us
of
wonderful
blackberries
here
and
such
multitudes
of
them
and
we
persuaded
evan
to
drive
us
you
know
we
do
often
have
him
to
do
anything
for
us
so
we
came
but
i
do
know
what
we
should
have
done
if
we
had
not
met
you
gertrude
and
i
thought
we
would
come
and
see
what
a
picnic
on
bear
hill
meant
and
she
laughed
again
smiles
came
very
easily
to
her
pretty
little
face
and
then
she
introduced
miss
masters
knowlton
stood
by
looking
on
at
them
all
these
elegant
women
thought
diana
what
must
i
seem
to
him
and
truly
her
print
gown
was
of
homely
quality
and
country
wear
she
did
not
take
into
the
account
a
fine
figure
which
health
and
exercise
had
made
free
and
supple
in
all
its
movements
and
which
the
quiet
poise
of
her
character
made
graceful
whether
in
motion
or
rest
for
grace
is
no
gift
of
a
or
result
of
the
schools
it
is
the
growth
of
the
mind
more
than
of
the
body
the
natural
and
almost
necessary
symbolization
in
outward
lines
of
what
is
noble
simple
and
free
from
self
and
not
almost
but
quite
necessary
if
the
further
conditions
of
a
and
figure
and
a
free
and
unconstrained
habit
of
life
are
not
wanting
the
conditions
all
met
in
diana
the
harmony
of
development
was
as
it
always
is
lovely
to
see
but
a
shadow
fell
on
her
heart
as
she
turned
to
lead
the
way
through
the
wood
to
the
blackberry
field
for
in
the
artistic
elegance
of
the
ladies
beside
her
she
thought
she
recognised
somewhat
that
belonged
to
knowlton
sphere
and
not
to
her
own
something
that
removed
her
from
him
and
drew
them
near
she
thought
he
could
not
fail
to
find
it
so
what
then
she
did
not
ask
herself
what
then
indeed
she
had
no
leisure
for
difficult
analysis
of
her
thoughts
dear
me
how
rough
reverdy
exclaimed
really
evan
i
did
not
know
what
you
were
bringing
us
to
is
it
much
farther
we
have
to
go
it
is
all
rough
said
diana
you
ought
to
have
thick
shoes
o
i
have
i
put
on
horridly
thick
ones
look
is
that
thick
enough
but
i
never
felt
anything
like
these
stones
is
the
blackberry
field
full
of
them
too
really
evan
i
think
i
can
not
get
along
if
you
do
give
me
your
arm
you
have
two
arms
knowlton
ca
i
have
the
other
one
cried
miss
masters
dolefully
i
have
got
trees
on
my
other
arm
gatty
i
do
see
where
i
should
put
you
ca
you
help
miss
starling
along
till
we
get
out
of
the
woods
is
it
very
impertinent
of
him
to
call
me
gatty
said
the
little
beauty
tossing
her
long
locks
and
speaking
in
a
half
aside
to
diana
now
he
would
like
that
i
should
return
the
compliment
and
call
him
evan
but
i
wo
what
do
do
when
men
call
you
by
your
christian
name
she
was
trying
to
read
diana
as
she
spoke
eyeing
her
with
sidelong
glances
and
as
they
went
laying
her
daintily
gloved
hand
on
arm
to
help
herself
along
diana
was
astounded
both
at
her
confidence
and
at
her
request
for
counsel
but
as
to
meet
the
request
would
be
to
return
the
confidence
she
was
silent
she
was
thinking
too
of
the
elegant
little
boot
reverdy
had
displayed
and
contrasting
it
with
her
own
coarse
shoes
and
how
very
familiar
these
two
were
that
he
should
speak
to
her
by
her
first
name
so
miss
starling
cried
the
other
lady
behind
her
do
you
know
we
have
been
following
your
lead
all
the
way
we
were
coming
this
morning
knowlton
said
so
diana
replied
half
turning
are
you
very
much
flattered
this
time
diana
turned
quite
and
faced
the
two
my
mother
was
driving
mrs
reverdy
ah
said
the
other
with
a
very
amused
laugh
but
you
could
have
done
it
just
as
well
i
suppose
what
does
she
mean
thought
diana
can
you
do
anything
inquired
the
gay
lady
on
her
arm
i
am
a
useless
creature
i
can
only
fire
a
pistol
and
leap
a
fence
on
horseback
and
dance
a
polka
what
can
you
do
i
dare
say
you
are
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
me
can
you
make
butter
and
bread
and
pudding
and
pies
and
sweetmeats
and
pickles
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
dare
say
you
can
i
can
do
that
and
all
i
am
good
for
is
to
eat
them
i
can
do
that
do
you
make
cheeses
too
i
can
my
mother
generally
makes
the
cheese
o
but
i
mean
you
what
do
people
do
on
a
farm
women
i
mean
i
know
what
the
men
do
you
know
all
about
it
do
you
have
to
milk
the
cows
and
feed
everything
chickens
and
pigs
you
know
and
all
that
the
men
milk
said
diana
and
you
have
to
do
those
other
things
is
it
horrid
it
is
not
horrid
to
feed
the
chickens
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
pigs
o
but
evan
says
you
know
how
to
harness
horses
does
he
thought
diana
and
you
can
cut
wood
cut
wood
diana
repeated
did
anybody
say
i
could
do
that
i
do
know
yes
i
think
so
i
forget
but
you
can
ca
you
i
never
tried
miss
masters
do
you
know
my
cousin
mr
masters
the
minister
you
know
yes
i
know
him
a
little
do
you
like
him
i
like
him
yes
i
do
know
anything
against
him
said
diana
in
great
bewilderment
o
but
i
do
do
you
know
he
says
it
is
wicked
to
do
a
great
many
things
that
we
do
he
thinks
everybody
is
wicked
who
do
do
just
as
he
does
now
i
do
think
everybody
is
bound
to
be
a
minister
he
thinks
it
is
wicked
to
dance
and
i
do
care
to
live
if
i
dance
that
is
being
very
fond
of
it
said
diana
do
you
dance
her
in
the
country
sometimes
not
very
often
is
it
very
dull
here
in
the
winter
when
you
ca
go
after
blackberries
diana
smiled
i
never
found
it
dull
she
said
nevertheless
the
contrast
smote
her
more
and
more
between
what
knowlton
was
accustomed
to
in
his
world
and
the
very
plain
humdrum
uneventful
unadorned
life
she
led
in
hers
and
this
elegant
creature
whose
very
dress
was
a
sort
of
revelation
to
diana
in
its
perfection
of
beauty
she
seemed
to
the
poor
country
girl
to
put
at
an
immense
distance
from
knowlton
those
who
could
not
be
charming
and
refined
and
exquisite
in
the
like
manner
her
gloves
one
hand
rested
on
diana
arm
and
pulled
a
little
too
what
gloves
they
were
for
colour
and
fit
and
make
her
foot
was
a
study
her
hat
might
have
been
a
fairy
hat
and
the
face
under
it
pretty
and
gay
and
wilful
and
sweet
how
could
any
man
help
being
fascinated
by
it
diana
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
impossible
the
rambling
path
through
the
woods
brought
the
party
out
at
last
upon
a
wild
barren
where
stones
and
a
rank
growth
of
blackberry
bushes
were
all
that
was
to
be
seen
only
far
off
might
be
had
the
glimpse
of
other
hills
and
of
patches
of
cultivation
on
them
the
near
landscape
was
all
barrenness
and
blackberries
but
where
are
the
rest
of
the
people
said
reverdy
with
her
faint
laugh
are
we
alone
i
do
see
anybody
they
are
gone
on
they
are
picking
diana
explained
hid
in
this
scrubby
forest
of
bushes
said
her
brother
have
we
got
to
go
into
that
forest
too
if
you
want
to
pick
berries
i
think
we
sit
here
and
let
the
rest
do
the
picking
said
reverdy
looking
with
charming
merriment
at
gertrude
but
gertrude
was
not
so
minded
no
i
going
after
berries
she
said
only
i
do
see
where
they
are
i
see
bushes
and
that
is
all
just
here
they
have
been
picked
said
diana
farther
on
there
are
plenty
well
you
lead
and
we
follow
said
knowlton
you
lead
miss
starling
and
we
will
keep
close
to
you
diana
plunged
into
the
blackberry
bushes
and
striking
off
from
the
route
she
guessed
the
other
pickers
had
taken
sought
a
part
of
the
wilderness
lower
down
on
the
hill
there
was
no
lack
of
blackberries
very
soon
every
bush
hung
black
with
them
great
fat
juicy
beauties
just
ready
to
fall
with
ripeness
blackberry
stains
spotted
the
whole
party
after
they
had
gone
a
few
yards
merely
by
the
unavoidable
crushing
up
against
the
bushes
diana
went
to
work
upon
this
rich
harvest
and
occupied
herself
entirely
with
it
but
never
was
so
dreary
to
her
the
very
sound
of
the
berries
falling
into
her
tin
pail
smote
her
with
a
sense
of
pain
she
thought
of
the
day
work
before
her
with
revulsion
however
it
was
before
her
and
her
fingers
flew
among
the
bushes
from
berry
to
berry
gathering
them
with
a
deft
skilfulness
her
companions
could
not
emulate
diana
knew
how
they
were
getting
on
without
using
her
eyes
to
find
out
for
all
their
experience
was
proclaimed
aloud
how
the
ground
was
rough
and
the
bushes
thorny
how
the
berries
blacked
their
lips
and
the
prickles
lacerated
their
fingers
and
the
stains
of
blackberry
juice
were
spoiling
gloves
and
dresses
and
all
they
had
on
i
never
imagined
said
reverdy
with
a
gay
laugh
that
picking
blackberries
was
such
a
serious
business
o
dear
and
it
only
just
eleven
now
and
i
am
so
hungry
eat
blackberries
said
gertrude
who
was
doing
it
diligently
but
i
want
to
carry
some
home
you
can
buy
we
came
for
fun
was
the
cool
answer
fun
said
reverdy
with
another
echoing
softly
echoing
laugh
it
the
fun
of
being
torn
and
stained
and
scratched
and
having
hat
pulled
off
one
hair
and
the
hair
off
one
head
diana
heard
it
all
they
were
not
far
from
her
and
she
heard
too
knowlton
little
remarks
half
gallant
half
mocking
but
very
familiar
she
thought
no
doubt
to
his
sister
but
how
to
miss
masters
too
yet
they
were
and
also
she
noticed
he
kept
in
close
attendance
upon
the
latter
young
lady
picking
into
her
basket
getting
her
out
of
her
numerous
entanglements
with
the
blackberry
branches
flattering
and
laughing
at
her
gertrude
was
having
what
she
would
call
a
good
time
why
not
and
why
should
i
thought
diana
to
herself
as
she
filled
her
pail
it
is
not
in
my
line
what
a
goose
i
was
to
fancy
that
this
young
man
could
take
pleasure
in
being
with
me
he
but
then
he
was
just
amusing
himself
it
was
not
i
it
was
the
country
and
the
fishing
and
so
on
what
a
goose
i
have
been
as
fast
as
the
blackberries
dropped
into
the
pail
so
fell
these
reflections
into
diana
heart
and
when
the
one
was
full
so
was
the
other
and
as
she
set
down
her
pail
and
began
upon
a
fresh
empty
one
so
she
did
with
her
thoughts
they
began
all
over
again
too
miss
starling
it
is
twelve
cried
reverdy
where
are
all
the
rest
of
the
people
do
you
work
all
day
without
dinner
i
expected
to
see
a
great
picnic
out
under
the
trees
here
this
is
not
the
picnic
place
said
diana
we
will
go
to
it
she
went
back
first
to
the
waggons
put
her
berries
in
safe
keeping
and
got
out
some
of
the
lunch
supplies
knowlton
loaded
himself
with
a
basket
out
of
his
waggon
and
the
procession
formed
again
in
indian
file
everybody
carrying
something
and
the
two
ladies
grumbling
and
laughing
in
concert
diana
headed
the
line
feeling
very
much
alone
and
wishing
sadly
it
were
all
over
and
she
at
home
how
was
she
to
play
her
part
in
the
preparations
at
hand
where
she
had
always
been
so
welcome
and
so
efficient
all
spring
and
life
seemed
to
be
taken
out
of
her
for
everything
but
the
dull
mechanical
picking
of
berries
however
strength
comes
with
necessity
she
found
chapter
viii
the
new
riches
of
the
old
world
there
was
quite
a
collection
of
people
on
bear
hill
as
could
be
seen
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
the
lunching
place
was
high
on
the
mountain
where
there
was
a
good
outlook
over
the
surrounding
country
and
here
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
blackberry
pickers
were
scattered
about
lying
and
sitting
on
the
ground
in
groups
and
pairs
chatting
and
watching
the
preparations
going
on
before
their
eyes
pretty
and
wild
the
preparations
were
under
a
big
tree
just
at
the
border
of
the
clearing
a
fire
was
kindled
a
stout
spike
driven
into
the
trunk
of
the
tree
held
a
just
over
the
blaze
wreaths
of
blue
and
grey
smoke
curling
up
above
the
made
their
way
through
the
tree
branches
into
the
upper
air
taking
hues
and
colours
and
irradiations
from
the
sunlight
in
their
way
the
forest
behind
the
wilderness
of
blackberry
bushes
in
front
the
wide
view
over
the
hills
and
vales
without
one
spot
of
cultivation
anywhere
or
a
trace
of
man
habitation
the
scene
was
wild
enough
the
soft
curling
smoke
grey
and
embrowned
gave
a
curious
touch
of
homeliness
to
it
from
two
fires
it
went
curling
up
as
comfortably
as
if
it
had
been
there
always
the
second
fire
was
lit
for
the
purpose
of
boiling
green
corn
which
two
or
three
people
were
busy
getting
ready
stripping
the
green
husks
off
other
hands
were
unloading
baskets
and
distributing
bread
and
butter
and
cups
and
unpacking
ham
and
chickens
meanwhile
till
the
fires
should
have
done
their
work
most
of
the
party
were
comfortably
awaiting
the
moment
of
enjoyment
and
taking
some
other
moments
as
it
seemed
by
the
way
carpenter
in
one
place
was
surrounded
by
her
large
family
of
children
all
come
to
pick
blackberries
all
heated
with
work
and
fun
and
eager
for
the
dinner
miss
barry
quite
tired
out
was
fanning
herself
with
her
and
having
a
nice
bit
of
chat
with
miss
babbage
the
sister
mansfield
and
farmer
carpenter
were
happily
discussing
systems
of
agriculture
boddington
was
making
a
circle
merry
with
her
sharp
speeches
younger
folks
here
and
there
were
carrying
on
their
own
particular
lines
of
skirmishing
operations
but
there
were
not
many
of
these
the
company
had
come
for
business
quite
as
much
as
for
play
indeed
miss
gunn
array
of
baskets
and
tin
pails
suggested
that
she
was
doing
business
on
her
brother
account
as
much
as
on
her
own
and
that
preserves
and
blackberry
wine
would
be
for
sale
by
and
by
on
the
shelves
of
the
store
at
the
corner
the
little
party
that
came
up
with
diana
melted
away
as
it
met
the
rest
reverdy
glided
into
the
group
gathered
about
boddington
and
slid
as
easily
into
the
desultory
gossip
that
was
going
on
diana
had
instantly
joined
herself
to
the
little
band
of
workers
at
the
camp
fire
only
one
or
two
had
cared
to
take
the
trouble
and
responsibility
of
the
feast
it
was
just
what
diana
craved
as
if
cooking
had
been
the
great
business
of
life
she
went
into
it
making
coffee
watching
the
corn
boiling
the
potatoes
looking
at
nothing
else
and
trying
to
see
nobody
and
as
far
as
possible
contriving
that
nobody
should
see
her
she
hid
behind
the
column
of
smoke
or
sheltered
herself
at
the
further
side
of
the
great
trunk
of
a
tree
from
the
fire
she
said
to
herself
but
her
face
took
on
a
preternatural
gravity
at
those
times
whenever
she
knew
it
was
safe
she
thought
she
did
not
look
at
anybody
yet
she
knew
that
miss
masters
had
joined
none
of
the
groups
under
the
trees
and
seemed
instead
to
prefer
a
solitary
post
in
front
of
them
all
where
her
pretty
figure
and
dainty
appointments
were
displayed
in
full
view
was
she
looking
at
the
landscape
diana
did
not
in
the
least
believe
it
but
she
tried
to
work
without
thinking
that
vainest
of
all
cheateries
where
the
conclusions
of
thought
independent
of
the
processes
force
themselves
upon
the
mind
and
lay
their
full
weight
upon
it
only
one
does
not
stop
anywhere
to
think
about
them
and
the
weight
is
distributed
it
is
like
driving
fast
over
thin
ice
stay
a
minute
in
any
one
place
and
you
would
break
through
but
that
consciousness
makes
unpleasant
driving
the
corn
gave
forth
its
sweet
smell
and
diana
dished
it
up
what
was
the
use
of
taking
so
much
trouble
she
thought
as
ear
after
ear
white
and
fair
came
out
of
the
pot
yet
diana
had
enjoyed
the
notion
of
making
this
variety
in
the
lunch
the
coffee
steamed
forth
its
fragrance
upon
the
air
and
diana
poured
it
into
prepared
cups
of
cream
and
sugar
which
others
brought
and
carried
away
she
was
glad
to
stand
by
the
fire
if
only
she
might
how
the
people
drank
coffee
before
the
cups
were
once
filled
the
first
time
they
began
to
come
back
for
the
second
and
the
second
diana
knew
would
not
satisfy
some
of
the
farmers
and
farmers
wives
there
so
pot
after
pot
of
the
rich
beverage
had
to
be
made
it
wearied
her
but
she
would
rather
do
that
than
anything
else
and
she
had
expected
this
picnic
to
be
such
a
pleasant
time
and
it
had
turned
out
such
a
failure
standing
by
her
camp
fire
where
the
ascending
column
of
grey
smoke
veiled
her
from
observation
diana
could
look
off
and
see
the
wide
landscape
of
hill
and
valley
spread
out
below
and
around
not
a
house
not
another
wreath
of
smoke
not
a
cornfield
hollows
of
beauty
with
nothing
but
their
own
green
growth
and
the
sunshine
in
them
fair
and
lovely
but
without
a
fence
that
told
of
human
ownership
or
a
road
that
spoke
of
human
sympathy
was
life
like
that
diana
wondered
yet
surely
that
landscape
had
never
looked
dreary
to
her
before
starling
will
have
another
cup
of
coffee
miss
diana
diana
started
what
should
bring
knowlton
to
wait
upon
her
cups
of
coffee
she
sugared
and
creamed
and
poured
out
in
silence
may
i
come
presently
and
have
some
have
you
had
any
just
enough
to
make
me
want
more

preparing

diana
coolly

mr
carpenter
said
mrs
boddington
coming
up
with
her
cup
how
mis
boddington
yes

asking
that
a
little
more
diana
it
and
the
corn
it

you
and
your
mother
how

you
think
we
women

all
the
time
under

said
carpenter
yes
all
the
time
how
think
we
feel
about
it
must
be
uncommon
powers
of
reaction
said
the
farmer
my
wife
anywheres
near
killed
yet
think
any
one
ever
get
that
piece
of
under
orders
said
boddington
looking
towards
the
place
where
the
frills
and
rufflings
of
miss
masters
drapery
stirred
in
the
breeze
with
the
long
light
tresses
of
her
unbound
hair
the
breeze
was
partly
of
her
own
making
as
she
stirred
and
turned
and
tossed
her
head
in
talking
with
knowlton
the
only
one
of
the
company
whom
she
would
talk
with
indeed
the
farmer
took
a
good
look
at
her
wall
said
he
should
say
it
was
best
to
do
with
that
kind
of
article
what
you
would
do
with
the
steam
from
your
tea
kettle
let
it
go
no
use
to
try
to
utilize
everything
mis
boddington
evan
knowlton
acts
as
if
he
thought
differently
looks
is
enough
with
some
folks
said
the
farmer
and
she
a
pretty
enough
creatur
take
the
outside
of
her
had
ought
to
be
for
i
guess
that
sort
o
riggin
costs
somethin
do
it
mis
boddington
cost
said
the
lady
evan
knowlton
is
a
fool
if
he
lets
himself
be
caught
by
such
butterfly
wings
but
men
fools
when
women
are
pretty
there
no
use
reasoning
against
nature

diany
exclaimed
joe
bartlett

said
diana
feeling
at
the
moment
that
it
was
not
so
very
wonderful
life
in
this
world
might
be
so
dull
as
to
be
not
worth
living
for
it
a
puzzle
to
me
joe
went
on
which
is
right
her
or
the
rest
on
us
ef
she
is
we
ai
and
her
and
the
rest
o
the

but
it
is
hard
to
say
she

right
for
she
the
happiest
woman
that

absently

said
joe

joe
he

only
a
lieutenant
want
to
know
said
joe
wall
i
kin
tell
ye
she
likes
him
and
joe
strolled
off
evidently
bent
on
doing
his
best
with
the
blackberry
bushes
so
must
diana
at
least
she
must
seem
to
do
it
there
was
a
lull
with
the
coffee
cups
lunch
was
getting
done
here
and
there
parties
were
handling
their
baskets
and
throwing
their
on
the
column
of
smoke
had
thinned
now
to
a
filmy
veil
of
grey
vapour
slowly
ascending
through
which
diana
could
look
over
to
the
round
with
their
green
leaves
glittering
in
the
sun
and
farther
still
to
the
blue
clear
vault
of
ether
where
there
was
neither
shine
nor
shadow
but
the
changeless
rest
of
heaven
earth
with
its
wildness
of
untrodden
ways
its
glitter
and
flutter
heaven
how
did
that
seem
far
off
and
inscrutable
though
with
an
infinite
depth
of
repose
an
infinite
power
of
purity
the
human
heart
shrank
before
both
and
i
had
thought
would
be
a
day
of
pleasure
diana
said
to
herself
if
i
could
get
into
the
waggon
and
go
home
alone
and
get
the
fire
started
and
the
afternoon
work
done
ready
for
supper
before
mother
comes
they
will
not
need
me
to
pilot
them
home
at
any
rate
but
things
have
to
be
faced
not
run
away
from
in
life
and
trials
take
their
time
and
can
not
be
lopped
into
easier
length
diana
did
what
she
could
she
caught
up
her
basket
very
quietly
carrying
it
and
her
in
one
hand
and
slipped
away
down
the
hill
under
cover
of
the
trees
till
she
was
out
of
sight
of
everybody
then
plunged
into
the
forest
of
high
bushes
and
lost
herself
she
began
to
pick
vigorously
if
she
was
found
anybody
should
see
what
she
was
there
for
it
was
a
thicket
of
thorns
and
fruit
the
berries
large
purple
dewy
with
bloom
hung
in
quantities
almost
in
masses
around
her
it
was
only
needful
sometimes
to
hold
her
basket
underneath
and
give
a
touch
to
the
fruit
and
it
dropped
fast
and
thick
into
her
hands
but
she
felt
as
if
the
cool
soft
berries
hurt
her
fingers
she
wondered
whereabouts
was
pretty
miss
masters
now
making
believe
pick
and
with
fingers
at
hand
to
supplement
her
and
looks
and
words
to
make
labour
sweet
even
if
it
were
labour
but
will
never
do
any
work
said
diana
to
herself
and
he
will
be
quite
willing
that
she
should
not
and
then
she
noticed
her
own
fingers
a
little
coarsened
with
honest
usefulness
they
were
a
little
and
a
little
embrowned
with
careless
exposure
not
white
and
pearly
and
delicate
like
those
of
that
other
hand
and
diana
remembered
that
knowlton
own
were
delicate
and
white
and
she
could
understand
she
thought
that
a
man
would
like
in
a
woman
he
loved
all
daintinesses
and
delicacies
even
although
they
pertained
to
the
ornamental
rather
than
to
the
useful
it
was
the
first
time
diana
had
ever
wished
for
white
hands
she
did
wish
for
them
now
or
rather
regret
the
want
of
them
with
a
sharp
sore
point
of
regret
even
though
it
would
have
made
no
difference
picking
and
thinking
and
fancying
herself
safe
diana
made
a
plunge
to
get
through
an
uncommonly
tangled
thicket
of
interlacing
branches
and
found
herself
no
longer
alone
miss
gunn
was
three
feet
off
squatting
on
the
ground
to
pick
the
more
restfully
and
on
the
other
side
of
her
was
diana
cousin
nick
boddington
hullo
di
was
his
salutation
where
have
you
left
my
wife
and
the
rest
of
the
folks
i
do
know

left

i
declare

thought

to
do

nick
and
i
doing
it
what
did
they
come
for
have
you
any
guess
likely
they
come
to
pick
blackberries
i
told
mis
reverdy
said
miss
gunn
smotheredly
from
the
depths
of
a
blackberry
bush
and
her
that
we
have
plenty
for
ourselves
and
elmfield
too
i
will
i
guess
they
want
miss
gunn
said
boddington
they
not
carry
home
a
pint
you
may
depend
di
did
they
come
after
you
or
you
come
after
them
this
morning
diana
answered
something
she
hardly
knew
what
and
made
a
plunge
through
the
bushes
in
another
direction
anything
to
get
out
of
neighbourhood
she
went
on
eagerly
through
thicket
after
thicket
till
she
supposed
she
was
safe
and
as
she
stopped
knowlton
came
round
from
the
other
side
of
the
bush
the
thrill
of
pain
and
pleasure
that
went
through
the
girl
gave
no
outward
sign
met
again
said
the
gentleman
what
has
become
of
you
i
have
lost
sight
of
you
since
dinner
one
ca
see
far
through
these
bushes
said
diana
no
what
a
thicket
it
is
but
at
the
same
time
people
can
hear
and
you
never
know
who
may
be
a
few
feet
off
does
anybody
ever
come
here
i
wonder
when
we
are
gone
or
is
this
wild
fruitful
hill
bearing
its
harvest
for
us
alone
other
parties
come
i
daresay
said
diana
she
was
picking
diligently
and
knowlton
set
himself
to
help
her
the
berries
were
very
big
and
ripe
here
for
a
few
minutes
the
two
hands
were
silently
busy
gathering
and
dropping
them
into
diana
pail
then
knowlton
took
the
burden
of
that
into
his
own
hand
diana
was
not
very
willing
but
he
would
have
it
one
would
think
blackberries
were
an
important
concern
of
life
he
said
presently
by
the
way
you
work
i
am
sure
you
are
working
too
said
diana
ah
but
i
supposed
you
knew
what
it
is
all
for
now
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
i
know
what
am
after
of
course
but
what
you
are
after
is
a
puzzle
to
me
things
are
very
often
a
puzzle
to
me
said
diana
vaguely
and
having
for
some
reason
or
other
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
commanding
herself
are
you
tired
no
i
do
know
said
diana
it
does
not
signify
i
do
believe
you
care
any
more
than
a
soldier
what
you
find
in
your
way
do
you
know
you
said
something
up
yonder
at
the
camp
fire
which
has
been
running
in
my
head
ever
since
i
wish
you
would
explain
it
i
said
diana
i
said
something
what
i
told
you
what
i
wanted
and
you
said
you
had
no
doubt
i
could
get
it
i
have
no
recollection
of
one
thing
or
the
other
knowlton
i
think
you
must
have
been
speaking
to
somebody
else
at
the
time
not
me
if
you
please
i
will
try
the
bushes
that
way
i
think
somebody
has
been
in
this
place
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
i
always
want
the
best
of
everything
he
said
as
he
followed
her
and
diana
went
too
fast
for
him
to
hold
the
briary
branches
out
of
her
way
there
are
so
many
other
people
who
are
of
that
mind
mr
knowlton
not
yourself
i
want
the
best
berries
said
diana
stopping
before
a
cluster
of
bushes
heavily
laden
how
about
other
things
diana
felt
a
pang
at
her
heart
an
odd
desire
to
make
some
wild
answer
but
nothing
could
be
cooler
than
what
she
said
i
take
them
as
i
find
them
mr
knowlton
he
was
helping
her
now
again
what
did
you
suppose
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
told
you
i
wanted
the
best
i
could
have
i
had
no
right
to
suppose
anything
no
doubt
it
is
true
of
all
sorts
of
things
but
i
was
thinking
of
did
you
guess
what
diana
hesitated
i
do
know
knowlton
i
might
guess
wrong
then
what
made
you
say
doubt
i
could
have
it
i
do
know
knowlton
said
diana
feeling
irritated
and
worried
almost
past
her
power
to
bear
do
you
always
have
what
you
want
do
you
think
i
can
he
said
eagerly
i
fancy
you
do
what
you
think
i
meant
by
the
thing
then
tell
me
do
tell
me
i
thought
you
meant
miss
gertrude
masters
diana
said
fairly
brought
to
bay
you
did
and
what
did
you
think
i
thought
of
miss
diana
starling
he
had
stopped
picking
blackberries
now
and
was
putting
his
questions
short
and
keenly
diana
power
of
answering
had
come
to
an
end
hey
said
he
drawing
her
hand
from
the
bush
and
stopping
her
work
what
did
you
think
i
thought
of
i
have
walked
with
her
and
driven
with
her
and
talked
with
her
in
the
house
and
out
of
the
house
now
all
summer
long
i
have
seen
what
she
is
like
at
home
and
abroad
what
do
you
think
i
think
of
baskets
and
berries
had
figuratively
fallen
to
the
ground
literally
too
in
knowlton
case
for
certainly
both
his
hands
were
free
and
had
been
employed
while
these
words
were
spoken
in
gently
and
slowly
gathering
diana
into
close
bondage
there
she
stood
now
hardly
daring
to
look
up
yet
the
tone
of
his
questions
had
found
its
way
to
her
inmost
heart
she
could
not
refuse
one
look
which
they
asked
for
it
gave
her
what
she
never
forgot
to
her
latest
day
does
she
know
now
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
mixed
tenderness
and
triumph
like
the
expression
of
his
face
my
lily
my
camellia
flower
my
sweet
magnolia
whatever
there
is
most
rare
and
good
and
perfect
my
best
of
all
things
can
i
have
the
best
di
miss
gertrude
masters
would
have
been
equal
to
the
situation
and
doubtless
would
have
met
it
with
great
equanimity
diana
was
unused
to
most
of
the
world
ways
and
very
new
to
this
she
stood
in
quiet
dignity
indeed
but
the
stains
of
crimson
on
cheek
and
brow
flushed
and
paled
like
the
lights
of
a
sunset
all
at
the
bottom
of
her
deep
was
knowlton
to
blame
if
he
gently
pushed
it
back
and
insinuated
it
off
till
he
had
a
full
view
you
know
what
is
my
now
he
said
can
i
have
it
diana
she
tried
to
break
away
from
him
and
on
her
lip
there
broke
that
beautiful
smile
of
hers
withal
a
little
tremulous
just
then
it
is
rare
on
a
grown
woman
lip
a
smile
so
very
guileless
and
free
mostly
it
belongs
to
children
yet
not
this
smile
either
i
should
think
you
must
know
by
this
time
she
whispered
i
suppose
he
did
for
he
put
no
more
questions
for
a
minute
or
two
there
one
more
thing
he
said
now
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
what
do
you
think
of
me
diana
i
think
you
are
very
imprudent
she
said
freeing
herself
resolutely
and
picking
up
her
anybody
might
come
mr
knowlton
anybody
might
but
if
ever
you
call
me
knowlton
again
i
do
something
extraordinary
diana
thought
he
would
have
a
great
many
things
to
teach
her
beside
that
she
went
at
her
with
bewildered
haste
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
but
mechanically
her
fingers
flew
and
the
berries
fell
knowlton
picked
rather
more
intelligently
but
between
them
i
must
say
they
worked
very
well
ah
the
blackberry
field
had
become
a
wonderful
place
and
while
the
mellow
purple
fruit
fell
fast
from
the
branches
it
seemed
also
as
if
years
had
reached
their
fruition
and
the
perfected
harvest
of
life
had
come
could
riper
or
richer
be
than
had
fallen
into
diana
hands
now
than
filled
them
now
so
it
was
she
thought
and
yet
this
was
not
life
harvest
only
the
bloom
of
the
flower
the
fruit
comes
not
to
its
maturity
with
one
sunny
day
and
it
needs
more
than
sunshine
but
let
the
fruit
grow
it
will
come
in
time
even
if
it
ripens
in
secret
and
meanwhile
smell
the
flower
it
was
the
fragrance
of
the
grape
blossom
that
filled
the
blackberry
field
most
sweet
most
evanishing
most
significant
oddly
many
people
do
not
know
it
but
it
must
be
that
their
life
has
never
brought
them
within
reach
of
its
charm
two
people
in
the
field
never
knew
how
the
shadows
grew
long
that
day
no
not
even
though
their
colloquy
was
soon
interrupted
and
by
gertrude
masters
herself
she
thenceforth
claimed
and
received
knowlton
whole
services
while
diana
in
her
turn
was
assisted
by
will
flandin
a
young
farmer
of
pleasant
valley
who
gave
his
hands
and
his
arms
to
her
help
it
did
not
make
much
difference
to
diana
it
might
have
been
an
ogre
and
she
would
not
have
cared
so
she
hardly
noticed
that
will
who
had
a
glib
enough
tongue
in
ordinary
was
now
very
silent
diana
herself
said
nothing
she
was
listening
to
hidden
music
there
a
wonderful
lot
o
blackberries
on
bear
hill
will
remarked
at
last
yes
said
diana
well
i
guess
we
cleaned
out
pretty
well
for
this
time
pursued
he
have
we
said
diana
why
all
these
folks
ha
been
pickin
all
day
i
should
ha
made
a
hole
in
silence
fell
again
how
the
roads
down
your
way
began
flandin
again
the
roads
pretty
well
i
believe
they
awful
up
this
way
to
bear
hill
i
say
miss
starling
how
do
you
those
people
lives
in
that
village
how
do
they
i
do
know
beats
me
they
do
raise
nothin
and
they
do
kill
nothin
it
other
folks
and
what
they
live
on
i
would
jest
like
to
know
mother
she
thinks
a
minister
had
ought
to
go
and
settle
down
among
but
i
tell
her
i
like
to
see
what
a
sheriff
do
fust
they
do
live
in
no
good
way
that
a
fact
poor
people
said
diana
they
do
even
know
enough
to
pick
blackberries
they
had
no
need
to
be
so
poor
ef
they
would
work
said
the
young
man
but
i
you
got
a
kind
word
for
every
one
you
miss
starling
diany
said
the
voice
of
joe
bartlett
who
was
pushing
his
way
towards
her
through
the
bushes
diany
here
you
be
here
your
mother
lookin
for
ye
got
all
you
want
it
gettin
time
to
make
tracks
for
hum
the
sun
low
i
ready
joe
give
me
one
o
them
pails
then
and
we
try
ef
we
kin
git
through
these
pesky
bushes
i
vow
i
would
like
to
take
bear
hill
for
a
farm
not
on
a
long
lease
they
pushed
and
fought
their
way
in
the
thicket
for
a
long
distance
till
as
joe
remarked
they
had
surveyed
the
hill
pretty
well
diana
conscious
all
the
time
that
knowlton
and
gertrude
were
following
in
their
wake
that
was
near
enough
she
liked
it
so
she
liked
it
even
that
in
the
crowd
and
the
bustle
of
packing
and
hitching
horses
and
getting
seated
there
was
no
chance
for
more
than
a
nod
and
wave
of
the
hand
from
the
elmfield
parly
they
drove
off
first
this
time
and
diana
followed
at
a
little
distance
driving
prince
starling
declaring
herself
tuckered
out
there
was
no
sense
of
weariness
on
diana
never
less
in
her
life
she
was
glad
the
drive
was
so
long
not
because
she
was
weary
and
wanted
to
rest
but
because
every
nerve
and
sense
seemed
strung
to
a
fine
tension
so
that
everything
that
touched
them
sent
waves
of
melody
over
her
being
truly
the
light
was
sweet
that
evening
for
any
eyes
to
diana
vision
the
sunbeams
were
solid
gold
though
refined
out
of
all
sordidness
and
earth
was
heaped
up
and
brimming
over
with
riches
the
leaves
of
the
trees
on
the
sparkled
in
the
new
wealth
of
nature
the
air
scintillated
with
it
the
water
was
full
of
it
prince
hoofs
trod
in
measure
and
the
wheels
of
the
waggon
moved
rhythmically
and
the
evening
breeze
might
have
been
the
very
spirit
of
harmony
the
way
was
long
and
before
home
was
reached
the
light
had
faded
and
the
sparkling
was
gone
but
even
that
was
welcome
to
diana
she
was
glad
to
have
a
veil
fall
for
a
while
over
the
brightness
and
hide
even
from
herself
the
new
world
into
which
she
had
entered
she
knew
it
was
there
under
the
veil
the
knowledge
was
enough
for
the
present
chapter
ix
starling
opinions
it
was
well
dusk
when
prince
stopped
under
the
elm
tree
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
low
distant
hills
leaving
a
white
glory
in
all
that
region
of
the
heavens
and
shadows
were
settling
upon
the
valleys
all
household
wants
and
proprieties
were
disarranged
the
thing
to
do
was
to
bring
up
arrears
as
speedily
as
possible
to
this
starling
and
her
daughter
addressed
themselves
the
blackberries
were
put
carefully
away
the
table
set
supper
cooked
for
the
men
must
have
a
warm
supper
and
after
supper
and
clearing
up
there
came
a
lull
if
it
war
so
late
said
starling
but
it
too
late
i
go
at
those
berries
mother
not
well
no
it
too
late
as
i
said
and
i
tired
i
want
to
know
if
this
is
what
folks
call
work
or
play
if
it
play
rather
work
for
my
part
i
believe
i
sooner
stand
at
the
than
pick
blackberries
mother
well
yes
said
starling
i
know
when
my
work
was
done
if
the
sun
had
gone
down
we
all
be
pickin
yet
i
am
sure
you
could
stop
when
you
were
tired
mother
could
you
i
never
am
tired
child
while
i
see
my
work
before
me
do
you
know
that
and
it
a
sin
to
let
the
ripe
fruit
go
unpicked
i
wonder
what
it
grows
in
such
a
place
for
who
were
you
with
all
day
different
people
did
will
flandin
find
you
yes
he
was
in
a
takin
to
know
where
you
were
so
i
just
gave
him
a
bit
of
a
notion
i
do
see
how
could
know
mother
i
had
been
going
so
roundabout
among
the
bushes
i
do
know
where
i
was
myself
when
ever
you
do
know
that
diana
stop
and
find
out
starling
was
sitting
before
the
stove
in
a
resting
attitude
with
her
feet
stretched
out
towards
it
diana
was
busy
with
some
odds
and
ends
but
her
mother
tone
or
was
it
her
own
consciousness
made
her
suddenly
stop
and
look
towards
her
starling
did
not
see
this
diana
being
behind
her
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
will
was
sweet
on
you
she
went
on
will
flandin
mother
an
inarticulate
note
of
assent
diana
did
not
answer
and
instead
went
on
with
what
she
had
been
doing
hey
said
starling
i
hope
he
get
cured
of
it
mother
if
he
is
why
i
do
know
why
said
diana
half
laughing
except
that
he
had
better
be
sweet
on
some
one
else
he
a
nice
fellow
yes
i
think
he
is
as
they
go
and
he
be
very
well
off
diana
he
no
match
for
me
then
mother
for
i
am
well
off
now
no
you
ai
child
said
starling
we
have
enough
to
live
on
but
that
all
what
more
does
anybody
want
you
do
mean
what
you
say
diana
cried
her
mother
turning
upon
her
do
you
want
to
have
pretty
things
and
a
nice
house
and
furniture
to
suit
you
and
maybe
servants
to
do
your
work
i
wonder
who
particular
if
you
ai
would
you
like
a
nice
carriage
i
like
all
these
things
well
enough
mother
but
they
are
not
the
first
thing
what
is
the
first
thing
said
starling
shortly
i
should
say
how
i
get
them
oh
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
the
man
was
the
first
thing
that
the
usual
lingo
diana
was
silent
again
now
you
can
have
will
her
mother
went
on
and
he
would
be
my
very
choice
for
you
diana
diana
made
no
response
he
is
smart
and
he
is
and
he
have
a
beautiful
farm
and
a
good
deal
of
money
ready
laid
up
to
begin
with
and
he
the
sort
to
make
it
more
and
not
make
it
less
and
his
mother
is
a
woman
it
one
of
the
best
families
in
all
pleasant
valley
i
would
rather
not
marry
either
of
said
diana
with
a
little
half
laugh
again
you
know
mother
there
are
a
great
many
nice
people
in
the
world
i
ca
have
all
of
who
were
you
with
all
the
forenoon
starling
asked
suddenly
you
went
off
and
left
me
with
the
people
from
elmfield
i
was
taking
care
of
them
i
saw
you
come
out
of
the
field
with
them
what
a
popinjay
that
masters
girl
is
to
be
sure
and
what
her
name
the
other
is
not
much
better
soft
as
oil
and
as
slippery
how
on
earth
did
come
to
bear
hill
i
suppose
they
thought
it
would
be
fun
diana
said
with
constrained
voice
do
let
anybody
get
sweet
on
you
there
diana
starling
not
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
you
where
mother
at
elmfield
among
the
knowlton
folks
what
the
matter
with
them
diana
asked
but
not
without
a
touch
of
amusement
in
her
voice
which
perhaps
turned
the
edge
of
her
suspicion
she
went
on
however
energetically
poor
and
proud
she
said
poor
and
proud
and
that
about
the
meanest
kind
of
a
mixture
there
is
i
do
mind
if
folks
has
something
to
go
on
why
airs
come
to
human
nature
i
can
forgive
anyhow
for
i
as
proud
as
they
be
but
when
they
anything
and
when
they
pile
up
their
pretensions
so
high
they
carry
steady
for
my
part
i
rather
keep
out
o
their
way
no
pleasure
to
me
and
if
they
think
they
an
honour
it
an
opinion
i
do
share
gertrude
masters
ai
no
better
than
a
balloon
full
of
gas
she
hai
weight
enough
to
keep
her
on
her
feet
and
her
name
genevy
she
as
smooth
as
an
eel
and
evan
is
a
monkey
mother
what
makes
you
say
so
why
do
he
shave
himself
then
like
other
folks
why
mother
it
is
just
the
fashion
in
the
army
to
wear
a
moustache
what
business
has
he
to
be
in
the
army
he
ought
to
be
here
helping
his
grandfather
i
have
no
sort
o
patience
with
him
mother
you
know
they
sent
him
to
the
military
academy
of
course
he
could
not
help
being
in
the
army
it
is
no
fault
of
his
he
could
quit
it
i
suppose
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
ai
that
sort
he
just
likes
to
wear
gold
on
his
shoulders
and
a
stripe
down
his
leg
and
fancy
buttons
and
go
with
his
coat
flying
all
open
to
show
his
white
shirt
i
think
when
folks
have
a
pair
of
such
broad
shoulders
they
meant
to
do
some
work
but
he
never
do
none
he
please
himself
and
hold
himself
up
high
over
them
that
work
and
live
to
die
poor
wo
have
you
take
after
such
a
fellow
diana
mind
i
wo
i
wo
have
settin
yourself
up
above
your
mother
and
despisin
the
ways
you
was
brought
up
to
and
i
want
you
to
be
mistress
o
will
flandin
house
and
lands
and
money
and
you
can
if
you
a
mind
to
diana
was
a
little
uncertain
between
laughing
and
crying
and
thought
best
not
to
trust
her
voice
so
they
went
up
to
their
rooms
and
separated
for
the
night
but
all
inclination
to
tears
was
shut
out
with
the
shutting
of
her
door
was
not
the
moonlight
streaming
full
and
broad
over
all
the
fields
filling
the
whole
world
with
quiet
radiance
so
came
down
the
clear
quiet
illumination
of
her
happiness
upon
all
diana
soul
there
was
no
disturbance
there
was
no
shadow
there
was
no
wavering
of
that
full
flood
of
still
ecstasy
all
things
not
in
harmony
with
it
were
hidden
by
it
that
the
way
with
moonlight
and
the
daylight
was
sweeter
early
diana
always
saw
it
in
those
prime
hours
of
day
when
strength
and
freshness
and
promise
and
bright
hope
are
the
speech
and
the
of
nature
how
much
help
the
people
lose
who
lose
all
that
when
the
sun
first
look
at
the
mountains
breaks
into
a
smile
when
morning
softly
draws
off
the
veil
from
the
work
there
is
to
do
when
the
stir
of
the
breeze
speaks
courage
or
breathes
kisses
of
sympathy
and
the
clear
blue
sky
seems
waiting
for
the
rounded
and
perfected
day
to
finish
its
hours
now
just
beginning
diana
often
saw
it
so
she
did
not
often
stop
so
long
at
her
window
to
look
and
listen
as
she
did
this
morning
it
was
a
clear
calm
crisp
morning
without
a
touch
of
frost
promising
one
of
those
mellow
golden
delicious
days
of
september
that
are
the
very
ripeness
of
the
year
just
yet
six
held
only
the
promise
of
it
like
her
life
but
the
daylight
brought
all
the
vigour
of
reality
and
last
night
was
moonshine
diana
sat
at
her
window
a
few
minutes
drinking
it
all
in
and
then
went
to
her
dairy
alas
one
head
may
be
in
rare
ether
and
one
feet
find
bad
walking
spots
at
the
same
time
it
was
diana
experience
at
breakfast
how
are
those
pigs
getting
along
josiah
starling
demanded
wall
i
don
know
was
the
somewhat
unsatisfactory
response
guess
likely
the
little
one
gettin
ahead
lately
he
had
ought
to
said
starling
what
the
reason
the
others
ai
gettin
ahead
as
fast
as
him
he
a
different
critter
that
all
said
josiah
stolidly
he
be
the
biggest
they
all
fed
alike
fur
my
part
goes
said
josiah
but
when
it
comes
to
the
eatin
tell
you
that
little
feller
put
away
his
share
that
how
he
growd
so
they
are
not
any
of
the
size
they
ought
to
be
josiah
we
ai
feedin
corn
yet
but
they
are
not
as
big
as
they
were
last
year
this
time
do
see
how
you
help
it
said
josiah
i
ai
done
nothin
to
with
which
conclusion
starling
finished
his
breakfast
and
went
off
there
ai
the
hay
there
had
ought
to
be
in
the
mows
neither
starling
went
on
to
her
daughter
i
know
there
ai
not
by
tons
and
there
no
sort
o
a
crop
o
rye
i
wish
to
mercy
diana
you
do
somethin
do
what
mother
diana
said
gaily
you
mean
you
wish
josiah
would
do
something
i
know
what
i
mean
said
starling
and
i
commonly
say
it
that
is
when
i
say
anything
i
wish
anything
about
josiah
given
up
wishin
he
an
unaccountable
boy
there
no
dependin
on
him
and
the
thing
is
he
do
care
all
he
thinks
on
is
his
own
victuals
and
so
long
he
has
he
do
care
whether
the
rest
of
the
world
turns
round
or
no
i
suppose
it
the
way
with
most
people
mother
to
care
most
for
their
own
but
if
i
had
hired
myself
to
take
care
of
other
folks
things
it
said
starling
that
ai
my
way
just
see
what
i
have
done
this
morning
already
and
he
made
out
to
eat
his
breakfast
and
fodder
his
cattle
i
been
out
to
the
barn
and
had
a
good
look
at
the
hay
mow
and
calculated
the
grain
in
the
bins
and
seen
to
the
pigs
and
that
was
after
i
made
my
fire
and
ground
my
coffee
and
set
the
potatoes
on
to
boil
and
got
the
table
ready
and
the
rooms
swept
out
is
that
cream
going
to
get
churned
diana
no
mother
it
old
enough
it
is
not
ready
though
it
ought
to
be
i
tell
you
what
diana
you
must
set
your
cream
pot
in
here
o
nights
the
dairy
too
cold
warm
enough
yet
mother
makes
better
butter
you
do
get
nigh
so
much
though
that
last
buttermilk
was
all
thick
with
floatin
bits
of
butter
and
that
what
i
call
wasteful
i
call
it
good
though
there
where
you
make
a
mistake
diana
starling
and
if
you
ever
want
to
be
anything
but
a
poor
woman
you
got
to
mend
it
just
those
little
holes
in
your
pocket
that
let
out
the
money
a
penny
at
a
time
to
be
sure
but
by
and
by
when
you
come
to
look
for
the
dollars
you
wo
find
and
you
not
know
where
they
gone
and
you
want
mother
said
diana
laughing
i
ca
feel
afraid
we
have
never
wanted
yet
you
been
young
child
you
will
want
as
you
grow
older
marry
will
flandin
and
you
have
and
you
may
churn
your
cream
how
you
like
i
tell
you
what
diana
when
your
arm
ai
as
strong
as
it
used
to
be
and
your
back
gets
to
aching
and
you
feel
as
if
you
like
to
sit
down
and
be
quiet
instead
of
delvin
and
delvin
feel
as
if
would
be
handy
to
put
your
hand
in
your
pocket
and
find
cash
somewhere
my
i
wish
i
had
all
the
money
your
father
spent
for
books
books
just
makes
some
folks
crazy
do
you
know
it
the
afternoon
for
society
meeting
diana
i
had
forgotten
it
i
shall
not
go
one
of
us
must
said
starling
i
do
see
how
in
the
world
i
can
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
you
have
to
make
the
bread
then
diana
yesterday
put
me
all
out
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
those
blackberries
they
too
ripe
to
keep
i
do
them
up
this
afternoon
mother
i
take
care
of
them
the
morning
went
in
this
way
with
little
intermission
starling
was
perhaps
uneasy
from
an
undefined
fear
that
something
was
going
not
right
with
diana
affairs
she
could
lay
hold
on
no
clue
but
perhaps
the
secret
fear
or
doubt
was
the
reason
why
she
brought
up
as
if
by
sheer
force
of
affinity
every
small
and
great
source
of
annoyance
that
she
knew
of
all
the
morning
diana
had
to
hear
and
answer
a
string
of
suggestions
and
complainings
like
the
foregoing
she
was
not
unaccustomed
to
this
sort
of
thing
perhaps
and
doubtless
she
had
her
own
hidden
antidote
to
annoyance
yet
it
belonged
still
more
to
the
large
sweet
nature
of
the
girl
that
though
annoyed
she
was
never
irritated
wrinkles
never
lined
themselves
on
the
fair
smooth
brow
proper
token
of
the
depth
and
calm
of
the
character
within
chapter
x
in
sugar
dinner
was
over
and
talk
ceased
for
starling
went
to
dress
herself
for
the
sewing
society
and
presently
drove
off
with
prince
diana
motions
then
became
as
swift
as
they
were
noiseless
her
kitchen
was
in
a
state
of
perfected
order
and
propriety
she
went
to
dress
herself
then
a
modest
dressing
for
business
and
kitchen
business
too
must
claim
her
all
the
afternoon
but
it
is
possible
to
combine
two
effects
in
one
toilet
and
if
you
had
seen
diana
that
day
you
would
have
comprehended
the
proposition
a
common
print
gown
clean
and
showed
her
soft
outlines
at
least
as
well
as
a
more
modish
affair
would
and
the
sleeves
rolled
up
to
the
elbows
revealed
diana
beautiful
arms
i
am
bound
to
confess
she
had
chosen
a
white
apron
in
defiance
of
possible
fruit
stains
and
the
dark
hair
tucked
away
behind
her
ears
gave
the
whole
fair
cheek
and
temple
to
view
fair
and
delicate
in
contour
and
coloured
with
the
very
hues
of
a
perfect
physical
condition
i
think
no
man
but
would
like
to
see
his
future
wife
present
such
a
picture
of
womanly
beauty
and
housewifely
efficiency
as
diana
was
that
day
and
the
best
was
she
did
not
know
it
she
went
about
her
work
doubtless
she
had
a
sense
that
interruptions
might
come
that
afternoon
however
that
changed
nothing
she
had
moulded
her
bread
and
put
it
in
the
pans
and
got
it
out
of
the
way
and
now
the
berries
were
brought
out
of
the
pantry
and
the
preserving
kettle
went
on
the
fire
and
diana
fingers
were
soon
red
with
the
ripe
wine
of
the
fruit
all
the
time
she
had
her
ears
open
for
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
upon
the
road
it
had
not
come
so
that
a
quick
step
outside
startled
her
and
then
the
figure
of
knowlton
in
the
doorway
took
her
by
surprise
certainly
she
had
been
expecting
him
all
the
afternoon
but
now
whether
it
were
the
surprise
or
somewhat
else
diana
face
flushed
to
the
most
lovely
rose
yet
she
went
to
meet
him
with
simple
frankness
i
not
a
hand
to
give
you
she
said
not
a
hand
he
echoed
what
a
mercy
it
is
that
i
am
independent
of
hands
yesterday
i
should
have
been
in
despair
you
must
not
abuse
your
privileges
said
diana
trying
to
free
herself
and
o
knowlton
i
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
so
have
i
said
he
holding
her
fast
and
indeed
she
was
too
pretty
a
possession
to
be
easily
let
go
whole
loads
of
talking
and
no
end
of
di
i
never
saw
you
with
such
a
charming
colour
my
beauty
do
you
know
what
a
beauty
you
are
i
am
glad
you
think
so
she
said
think
so
wait
till
you
are
my
wife
and
i
can
dress
you
to
please
myself
i
think
you
will
be
a
very
princess
of
loveliness
in
the
meantime
knowlton
what
do
you
think
of
letting
me
finish
my
berries
berries
he
said
laughing
tell
me
first
di
what
do
you
think
of
me
inconvenient
said
diana
and
i
think
presuming
i
must
finish
my
berries
mr
knowlton
he
said
well
but
let
me
do
my
work
do
your
work
my
darling
how
am
i
going
to
talk
to
you
if
you
are
going
into
your
work
however
in
consideration
of
yesterday
you
may
what
made
you
come
to
this
door
diana
asked
i
knew
you
were
here
you
would
have
been
much
more
likely
to
find
mother
most
days
ah
but
i
met
prince
as
i
came
along
with
starling
behind
him
and
then
i
thought
what
i
remembered
said
knowlton
laughing
that
the
same
person
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
the
comfort
of
this
fact
being
upon
them
the
two
took
advantage
of
it
knowlton
drew
his
chair
close
to
the
table
over
which
fingers
were
so
busy
and
a
talk
began
which
in
the
range
and
variety
and
arbitrary
introduction
of
its
topics
it
would
be
in
vain
to
try
to
follow
through
it
all
diana
work
went
on
except
now
and
then
when
her
fingers
made
an
involuntary
pause
the
berries
were
picked
over
and
weighed
and
put
over
the
fire
and
watched
and
tended
there
while
the
tall
form
of
the
young
officer
stood
beside
diana
as
she
handled
her
skimmer
and
went
back
and
forth
as
she
went
helping
her
to
carry
her
jars
of
sweetmeat
have
you
told
your
mother
knowlton
asked
no
why
not
he
asked
quickly
i
did
not
think
it
was
a
good
time
last
night
or
this
morning
does
she
not
like
me
i
think
she
wants
to
put
some
one
else
in
your
place
evan
who
he
asked
instantly
nobody
you
need
fear
said
diana
laughing
nobody
i
like
is
there
anybody
you
do
like
plenty
of
people
that
i
like
a
little
how
much
do
you
like
me
diana
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
calm
large
grey
eyes
into
which
there
had
come
a
new
depth
since
yesterday
and
an
added
light
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
dropped
them
in
silence
well
said
he
eagerly
why
do
you
speak
i
can
not
said
diana
why
i
can
speak
to
you
i
suppose
people
are
different
said
diana
and
i
am
a
woman
well
what
then
she
turned
away
with
the
shyest
sweetest
grace
of
reserve
turned
away
to
her
fruit
quite
naturally
there
was
no
shadow
of
affectation
nor
even
of
consciousness
but
her
eyes
did
not
look
up
again
and
knowlton
eyes
had
no
interruption
di
where
do
you
think
we
shall
go
when
we
are
married
i
do
know
she
said
simply
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
said
that
she
did
not
care
it
was
as
quiet
as
the
harebells
when
no
wind
is
blowing
and
do
know
knowlton
echoed
with
a
i
do
know
where
i
am
going
myself
but
i
shall
know
in
a
day
or
two
can
you
be
ready
in
a
week
do
you
think
diana
shall
you
have
to
go
so
soon
as
that
she
asked
with
a
startled
look
up
pretty
near
what
of
that
you
are
going
with
me
it
may
be
to
some
rough
place
we
never
can
tell
you
know
we
are
a
sort
of
football
for
uncle
sam
to
toss
about
as
he
pleases
but
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
a
soldier
wife
di
she
looked
at
him
without
speaking
a
look
clear
and
quiet
and
glad
like
her
voice
when
she
spoke
so
full
of
the
thought
of
the
reality
he
suggested
evidently
that
she
never
perceived
the
occasion
for
a
blush
her
eyes
went
through
him
to
the
rough
country
or
the
frontier
post
where
she
could
share
and
annul
all
his
harsh
experiences
what
sort
of
places
are
those
where
you
might
go
evan
nearly
all
sorts
on
the
face
of
the
earth
my
beauty
i
might
be
sent
to
the
neighbourhood
of
one
of
the
great
cities
we
should
have
a
good
time
then
di
i
would
wait
for
nothing
i
could
come
and
fetch
you
just
as
soon
as
i
could
get
a
furlough
of
a
day
or
two
but
they
are
apt
to
send
us
the
young
officers
to
the
hardest
places
posts
beyond
civilisation
out
west
to
the
frontier
or
south
to
texas
or
across
to
the
pacific
coast
california
diana
cried
california
or
oregon
or
arizona
yes
why
california
is
very
far
off
rather
said
knowlton
with
a
half
sigh
again
it
do
make
any
difference
if
we
were
once
there
diana
diana
looked
thoughtful
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
this
time
to
wish
that
the
country
were
not
so
extended
and
certainly
not
to
fancy
that
california
and
she
had
any
interest
in
common
lo
now
it
might
be
how
soon
you
go
evan
she
asked
as
thoughts
of
longitude
and
latitude
began
to
deepen
the
cloud
shadow
which
had
just
touched
her
a
few
days
a
week
or
two
more
is
that
all
can
you
go
with
me
he
whispered
bending
forward
to
pick
up
a
few
of
her
berries
for
the
taste
of
which
he
certainly
did
not
care
at
that
moment
and
she
whispered
no
ca
you
you
know
it
impossible
evan
then
i
must
go
by
myself
he
said
in
the
same
half
breath
stooping
his
head
still
so
near
that
a
half
breath
could
be
heard
and
his
hair
quite
emancipated
from
the
regulation
cut
touched
diana
cheek
i
do
know
how
i
can
but
di
if
i
can
get
a
furlough
at
christmas
and
come
for
you
will
you
be
ready
then
she
whispered
yes
that
is
supposing
i
am
in
any
place
that
i
can
take
you
to
he
went
on
after
a
hearty
endorsement
of
the
contract
just
made
it
is
quite
possible
i
may
not
be
but
i
wo
borrow
trouble
this
is
the
first
trouble
i
ever
had
in
my
life
di
leaving
you
they
say
prosperity
makes
people
proud
she
said
with
an
arch
glance
at
him
echoed
knowlton
yes
i
proud
i
have
a
right
to
be
proud
i
do
not
think
diana
there
is
such
a
pearl
in
all
the
waters
of
arabia
as
i
shall
wear
on
my
hand
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
rose
to
equal
you
in
all
the
gardens
of
the
world
look
up
my
beauty
and
let
me
see
you
i
have
the
chance
pretty
soon
and
yielding
to
the
light
touch
of
his
fingers
under
her
chin
caressing
and
persuading
diana
face
was
lifted
to
view
it
was
like
a
pearl
for
the
childlike
purity
of
all
its
lines
it
was
like
enough
a
rose
too
like
an
opening
rose
for
the
matter
of
that
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
elegance
of
reverdy
and
gertrude
masters
and
she
wondered
in
herself
at
knowlton
judgment
of
her
but
there
was
too
much
of
diana
ever
to
depreciate
herself
unworthily
she
said
nothing
i
wonder
what
will
become
you
best
said
evan
in
a
very
satisfied
tone
become
me
said
diana
lifting
her
eyes
yes
what
your
colour
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
diana
laughing
no
one
in
particular
i
guess
wear
everything
can
you
i
should
wonder
but
i
think
i
should
like
you
in
white
that
cold
for
winter
in
some
regions
i
think
i
should
like
you
in
let
me
see
show
me
your
eyes
again
diana
if
you
wear
so
much
rose
in
your
cheeks
my
darling
said
he
kissing
first
one
and
then
the
other
i
should
be
safe
to
get
you
green
you
will
be
lovely
in
blue
but
of
all
white
i
think
i
should
like
you
diana
in
royal
red
i
thought
purple
was
the
colour
of
kings
and
queens
diana
remarked
trying
to
get
back
to
her
berries
purple
is
poetical
i
am
certain
a
dark
rich
red
would
be
magnificent
on
you
for
it
is
you
who
will
beautify
the
colour
not
the
colour
you
i
shall
get
you
the
first
stuff
of
that
colour
i
see
that
is
of
the
right
hue
pray
do
evan
wait
said
diana
flushing
more
and
more
wait
i
not
wait
a
minute
longer
than
till
i
see
it
my
beauty
what
a
delight
to
get
things
for
you
and
with
you
officers
quarters
are
sorry
places
sometimes
diana
but
wo
it
be
fun
for
you
and
me
to
work
transformations
and
make
our
own
world
that
is
our
own
home
what
does
starling
think
of
me
i
have
told
her
nothing
evan
yet
she
was
so
busy
this
morning
i
had
not
a
good
chance
i
confront
her
when
she
comes
home
this
evening
o
no
evan
leave
it
to
me
i
want
to
take
a
time
she
will
not
like
it
much
anyhow
i
do
see
really
how
she
should
i
have
sympathy
no
i
have
i
have
a
bit
i
am
so
full
of
my
own
side
of
the
question
it
is
sheer
hypocrisy
to
pretend
i
have
any
feeling
for
anybody
else
when
will
you
come
down
to
elmfield
to
elmfield
said
diana
to
begin
to
learn
to
know
them
all
i
want
them
to
know
you
you
have
not
spoken
to
them
about
me
no
said
he
laughing
but
i
mean
to
evan
do
say
anything
to
anybody
till
mother
has
been
told
promise
me
that
would
not
do
all
safe
yet
di
but
make
haste
with
your
revelations
for
i
shall
be
here
night
and
every
night
now
and
astonish
her
and
it
is
healthy
for
some
people
to
be
astonished
besides
di
my
orders
will
be
here
in
a
week
or
two
and
then
i
must
go
do
you
like
being
under
orders
said
diana
innocently
knowlton
grave
face
changed
again
and
laughing
he
asked
if
did
not
like
it
and
how
she
would
do
when
she
would
be
a
wife
and
so
under
orders
and
he
got
into
such
a
game
of
merriment
at
her
and
with
her
that
diana
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
or
her
berries
either
how
the
berries
got
attended
to
is
a
mystery
but
it
shows
that
the
action
of
the
mind
can
grow
mechanical
where
it
has
been
very
much
exercised
it
can
scarce
be
said
that
diana
thought
of
the
blackberries
and
yet
the
jam
was
made
and
the
wine
prepared
for
in
a
most
regular
and
faultless
manner
the
jars
were
filled
duly
and
nothing
was
burned
and
all
was
done
and
cleared
away
before
starling
came
home
literally
for
knowlton
had
been
sent
away
and
diana
had
gone
up
to
the
sanctuary
of
her
own
room
she
did
not
wish
to
encounter
her
mother
that
night
while
the
dew
was
not
yet
off
her
flowers
she
would
smell
their
sweetness
alone
chapter
xi
a
storm
in
september
diana
was
not
put
to
the
trial
next
day
of
venturing
her
precious
things
to
harsh
handling
a
very
uncommon
thing
happened
starling
was
not
well
and
kept
her
bed
she
had
caught
cold
she
confessed
by
some
imprudence
the
day
before
and
symptoms
of
pleurisy
made
it
impossible
that
she
should
fight
sickness
as
she
liked
to
fight
it
on
foot
the
doctor
was
not
to
be
thought
of
starling
gave
her
best
and
only
confidence
to
her
own
skill
but
even
that
bade
her
lie
by
and
give
up
diana
had
the
whole
house
on
her
hands
as
well
as
the
nursing
truth
to
tell
this
last
was
not
much
starling
would
have
very
little
of
her
daughter
presence
still
less
of
her
ministrations
to
be
let
alone
was
her
principal
demand
and
that
diana
should
keep
things
straight
below
diana
did
that
the
house
went
on
as
well
as
ever
and
even
the
farm
affairs
received
the
needful
supervision
josiah
davis
was
duly
ordered
fed
and
dismissed
and
when
evening
came
diana
was
dressed
in
order
bright
and
ready
for
company
company
it
pleased
her
to
receive
in
the
kitchen
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
beneath
her
would
have
roused
starling
to
a
degree
of
excitement
from
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
keep
back
anything
and
probably
to
a
degree
of
consequent
indignation
which
would
have
been
capable
of
very
informal
measures
of
ejectment
regarding
the
intruder
no
diana
could
not
risk
that
she
must
wait
till
her
mother
nerves
and
temper
were
at
least
in
their
ordinary
state
of
wholesome
calm
before
she
would
shock
them
by
the
disclosures
she
had
to
make
and
almost
by
their
preciousness
to
herself
diana
gauged
their
unwelcomeness
to
her
mother
it
was
always
so
the
two
natures
were
so
unlike
that
not
even
the
long
habit
of
years
could
draw
them
into
sympathy
they
thought
alike
about
nothing
except
the
housewifely
matters
of
practical
life
so
these
evenings
when
starling
was
ill
diana
had
her
lamp
and
her
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
there
were
held
the
long
talks
with
knowlton
which
made
all
the
days
of
september
so
golden
days
when
diana
hands
were
too
busy
to
let
her
see
him
and
he
was
told
he
must
not
come
except
at
night
but
through
all
the
business
streamed
the
radiant
glow
of
the
last
night
talk
like
the
september
sunlight
through
the
misty
air
so
the
days
went
by
and
starling
was
kept
a
prisoner
pain
and
weakness
warning
her
she
must
not
dare
try
anything
else
and
in
their
engrossment
the
two
young
people
hardly
noticed
how
the
time
flew
people
in
pleasant
valley
were
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
visits
to
one
another
in
the
evenings
unless
specially
invited
so
nobody
discovered
that
evan
came
nightly
to
starling
house
and
if
his
own
people
wondered
at
his
absence
from
home
they
could
do
no
more
suspicion
had
no
ground
to
go
upon
in
any
particular
direction
the
month
had
been
glorious
with
golden
leaves
and
golden
sunshine
until
the
middle
was
more
than
past
then
came
a
september
storm
an
equinoctial
the
people
said
as
furious
as
the
preceding
days
had
been
gentle
whirlwinds
of
tempest
and
floods
of
rain
legions
of
clouds
rank
after
rank
bringing
the
winds
in
their
folds
or
did
the
winds
bring
them
all
one
day
and
night
and
all
the
next
day
the
storm
continued
and
night
darkened
early
upon
pleasant
valley
with
no
prospect
of
a
change
diana
had
watched
for
it
a
little
eagerly
visit
was
lost
the
night
before
of
course
it
was
much
to
lose
when
september
days
were
growing
few
and
now
another
night
he
could
not
come
diana
stood
at
the
door
after
supper
looking
and
making
her
conclusions
sorrowfully
it
was
darkening
fast
very
dark
it
would
be
for
there
was
no
moon
the
rain
came
down
in
streams
thick
and
grey
the
branches
of
the
elm
trees
swung
and
swayed
pitilessly
in
the
wind
beating
against
each
other
while
the
wind
whistled
and
shouted
its
intention
of
keeping
on
so
all
night
he
ca
come
sighed
diana
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
to
herself
and
she
shut
the
door
it
could
be
borne
however
to
lose
two
evenings
when
they
had
enjoyed
so
many
together
and
had
so
many
more
to
look
forward
to
and
with
that
mixture
in
her
heart
of
content
and
longing
which
everybody
knows
diana
trimmed
her
lamp
and
sat
down
to
sew
how
the
wind
roared
she
must
trim
her
fire
too
or
the
room
would
be
full
of
smoke
she
made
the
fire
up
and
then
the
snare
of
its
leaping
flames
and
glowing
coal
bed
drew
her
from
her
work
she
sat
looking
and
thinking
in
a
fulness
of
happiness
to
which
all
the
roar
of
the
storm
only
served
for
a
foil
she
heard
the
drip
drip
of
the
rain
the
stream
from
the
overcharged
eaves
trough
then
the
thunder
of
the
wind
sweeping
over
the
house
in
a
great
gust
and
the
whistle
of
the
elm
branches
as
they
swung
through
the
air
like
tremendous
lithe
switches
beating
and
writhing
and
straining
in
the
fury
of
the
blast
looking
into
the
clear
glowing
flames
diana
heard
it
all
with
a
certain
sense
of
enjoyment
when
in
the
midst
of
it
she
heard
another
sound
a
little
thing
but
distinguishable
from
all
the
rest
the
sound
of
a
foot
upon
the
little
stone
before
the
door
only
one
foot
it
could
be
in
the
world
diana
started
up
and
was
standing
with
lips
apart
facing
the
door
when
it
opened
and
a
man
came
in
enveloped
in
a
huge
cloak
dripping
at
every
point
evan
diana
exclamation
was
with
an
utterance
between
joy
and
dread
yes
said
he
as
he
came
forward
into
the
room
i
got
orders
without
another
word
she
helped
relieve
him
of
his
cloak
and
went
with
it
to
the
outer
kitchen
where
she
hung
it
carefully
to
dry
as
she
came
back
evan
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
looking
gravely
into
it
the
light
danced
and
gleamed
upon
the
gold
buttons
on
his
breast
and
touched
the
gold
bands
on
his
shoulders
it
was
a
very
stately
and
graceful
figure
to
diana
eyes
he
turned
a
little
took
her
into
his
arms
and
then
they
both
stood
silent
and
still
i
got
my
orders
knowlton
repeated
in
a
low
tone
to
go
soon
evan
immediately
i
knew
it
when
i
heard
your
foot
at
the
door
they
were
both
still
again
while
the
storm
swept
over
the
house
in
a
fresh
burst
the
wind
rushing
by
as
if
it
was
glad
he
was
going
and
meant
he
should
perhaps
the
two
did
not
hear
it
but
i
think
diana
did
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
kind
of
fury
how
could
you
get
here
evan
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
i
must
i
had
only
you
are
not
no
darling
rain
is
nothing
to
me
how
are
you
and
how
is
your
mother
she
is
better
she
is
getting
well
and
you
you
are
most
like
a
magnolia
tree
full
of
its
white
magnificent
blossoms
sweet
in
a
kind
of
wealth
of
sweetness
and
bountiful
beauty
one
blossom
would
do
for
a
comparison
for
ordinary
women
but
you
are
like
the
whole
tree
suppose
i
were
to
find
comparisons
for
you
ay
suppose
you
did
what
would
you
liken
me
to
said
he
with
a
sparkle
of
the
eyes
which
quite
indisposed
diana
from
giving
any
more
fuel
to
the
fire
that
supplied
it
what
di
you
might
as
well
give
me
all
the
comfort
you
can
to
take
away
with
me
i
shall
need
it
and
it
will
be
long
before
i
can
come
back
for
more
what
am
i
like
would
you
feel
any
better
for
thinking
yourself
like
a
pine
tree
or
a
green
hemlock
one
of
those
up
in
our
ravine
of
the
brook
ah
our
ravine
of
the
brook
those
days
are
all
gone
i
wish
i
were
a
green
hemlock
anywhere
with
you
a
magnolia
beside
me
or
better
a
climbing
rose
hanging
upon
me
if
i
could
take
you
di
the
pang
of
the
wish
was
very
keen
in
her
the
leap
of
the
will
towards
impossibilities
but
she
said
nothing
and
stood
quite
motionless
i
can
not
come
back
for
you
at
christmas
di
where
are
you
going
evan
where
i
would
not
take
you
anyhow
i
am
under
orders
to
report
myself
at
a
post
away
off
on
the
indian
frontier
a
long
journey
from
here
and
a
rough
wild
place
never
fit
for
such
as
you
of
course
we
young
officers
are
the
ones
to
be
sent
to
such
places
unless
we
happen
to
have
influence
at
headquarters
which
i
have
but
i
shall
not
stay
there
for
ever
must
you
go
just
where
they
send
you
yes
he
said
with
a
laugh
a
soldier
can
not
choose
must
you
stay
as
long
as
they
keep
you
there
yes
of
course
but
there
is
no
use
in
looking
at
it
gloomily
di
the
months
will
pass
give
them
time
and
years
are
made
of
months
the
good
time
will
come
at
last
i
not
the
first
who
has
had
to
bear
this
sort
of
thing
will
you
have
to
stay
there
ca
tell
i
may
it
depends
on
what
is
doing
and
how
much
i
am
wanted
probably
i
may
have
to
stay
two
years
at
least
perhaps
three
but
you
can
get
a
furlough
and
come
for
a
little
while
evan
said
diana
her
voice
sounded
frightened
that
the
worst
of
it
said
knowlton
i
do
know
whether
i
can
or
not
why
evan
do
they
always
generally
it
can
be
done
if
the
distance
is
not
too
great
and
you
are
not
too
useful
you
see
there
are
seldom
too
officers
on
hand
at
those
posts
is
there
so
much
to
do
said
diana
half
mechanically
her
thoughts
were
going
farther
for
grant
the
facts
what
did
the
reasons
matter
there
a
good
deal
to
do
sometimes
evan
answered
in
the
same
way
thinking
of
more
than
he
chose
to
speak
they
stood
silent
again
awhile
diana
was
clasped
in
knowlton
arms
her
cheek
rested
on
his
shoulder
they
both
looked
to
the
fire
for
consolation
snapping
sparkling
glowing
as
it
has
done
in
the
face
of
so
many
of
our
sorrows
small
and
great
is
there
no
consolation
or
suggestion
to
be
got
out
of
it
perhaps
from
it
came
the
suggestion
at
last
that
they
should
sit
down
evan
brought
a
chair
for
diana
and
placed
one
for
himself
close
beside
it
and
they
sat
down
holding
fast
each
hands
was
it
also
the
counsel
of
the
fire
that
they
should
sit
there
all
night
for
it
was
what
they
did
the
fire
burned
gloriously
the
lamp
went
out
the
red
lights
leaped
and
flickered
all
over
floor
and
ceiling
and
in
front
of
the
blaze
sat
the
two
and
talked
enough
to
last
two
years
you
and
i
might
say
but
alas
to
them
it
was
but
a
whetting
of
the
appetite
that
was
to
undergo
such
famine
if
i
could
only
take
you
with
me
my
darling
evan
said
for
the
twentieth
time
and
diana
was
silent
at
first
then
she
said
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
through
hardships
together
no
it
would
said
evan
not
hardships
for
you
my
beauty
they
are
all
very
well
for
me
in
a
soldier
line
but
not
for
you
a
soldier
wife
ought
not
to
be
altogether
unworthy
of
him
diana
answered
nor
he
of
her
so
i
would
take
you
if
i
could
where
i
am
going
a
soldier
wife
will
have
hardships
enough
first
and
last
no
fear
but
some
places
are
not
fit
for
women
anyhow
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
starling
though
and
had
it
out
with
her
had
it
out
repeated
diana
yes
i
should
have
a
little
bit
of
a
fight
should
i
she
like
me
much
i
wonder
why
evan
said
diana
after
a
minute
thought
if
you
are
to
be
so
long
away
there
is
no
need
to
speak
to
anybody
about
our
affair
just
now
it
is
our
affair
let
it
stay
so
it
is
our
secret
i
should
like
it
much
better
to
keep
it
a
secret
i
do
want
to
hear
people
talk
will
you
but
our
letters
my
dear
they
will
tell
your
mother
mother
will
not
see
mine
and
she
is
not
likely
to
see
yours
i
shall
go
to
the
post
office
myself
if
she
did
and
found
it
out
i
could
keep
quiet
easily
enough
she
would
not
want
to
speak
any
more
than
i
evan
combated
this
resolution
for
some
time
he
wished
to
have
diana
friends
with
his
sisters
and
at
home
at
elmfield
but
diana
had
her
own
views
and
desired
so
strongly
to
keep
her
secret
to
herself
during
the
first
part
at
least
of
what
threatened
to
be
a
long
engagement
that
at
last
he
yielded
it
did
not
matter
much
to
him
he
said
away
off
in
the
wilds
so
that
subject
was
dismissed
and
before
the
fantasia
of
the
flames
they
sat
and
composed
a
fantasia
of
life
for
themselves
as
bright
as
various
as
bewitching
as
evanishing
the
visions
of
which
were
mingled
with
the
leaping
and
changing
purple
and
flame
tints
the
sparkle
and
the
flash
of
the
fire
diana
could
never
stand
before
a
fire
of
hickory
logs
and
fail
to
see
her
reappear
as
she
had
seen
it
that
night
the
hours
went
by
it
too
bad
to
keep
you
up
so
my
darling
evan
remarked
i
am
selfish
no
indeed
but
you
must
want
something
evan
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
he
said
he
wanted
nothing
but
her
however
diana
energies
were
roused
she
ran
into
the
back
kitchen
and
came
from
thence
with
the
in
her
hands
filled
she
was
not
allowed
to
set
it
down
to
be
sure
but
under
her
directions
it
was
bestowed
in
front
of
the
glowing
coals
then
with
noiseless
rapid
movements
she
brought
a
little
table
to
the
hearth
and
fetched
cups
and
plates
and
then
she
spread
the
board
there
was
a
cold
ham
on
the
big
table
and
round
white
slices
of
bread
such
as
cities
never
see
and
cake
light
and
fruity
and
yellow
butter
and
a
cream
pie
another
dainty
that
confectioners
are
innocent
of
and
presently
the
fragrance
of
coffee
filled
the
old
to
the
very
roof
evan
laughed
at
her
but
confessed
himself
hungry
and
diana
had
it
all
her
own
way
for
once
this
rare
once
she
would
have
the
pleasure
she
and
evan
alone
many
a
day
would
come
and
go
before
she
might
have
it
again
so
she
thought
as
she
poured
coffee
upon
the
cream
in
his
cup
and
whether
the
pleasure
or
the
pain
were
the
keenest
even
then
i
can
not
tell
but
it
was
one
of
those
minutes
when
one
chooses
the
pleasure
and
will
have
it
and
will
taste
it
whatever
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
draught
the
small
hours
of
night
the
kitchen
the
table
she
and
evan
at
opposite
sides
of
it
the
pleasure
of
ministering
such
as
every
woman
knows
the
beauty
of
her
bread
the
magnificence
of
her
coffee
the
perfection
of
her
cookery
the
exultation
of
seeing
him
enjoy
it
while
her
heart
was
storing
up
its
treasure
of
sorrow
for
the
unfolding
by
and
by
and
knew
it
and
covered
it
up
and
went
on
enjoying
the
minute
the
criticism
is
sometimes
made
upon
a
writer
here
and
there
that
he
talks
too
much
about
and
in
a
and
artificial
state
of
society
it
is
indeed
true
that
eating
is
eating
and
nothing
more
servants
prepare
the
viands
and
servants
bring
them
and
the
result
is
more
or
less
agreeable
and
satisfactory
but
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
much
of
poetry
or
sentiment
about
it
the
case
is
not
so
with
humbler
livers
on
the
earth
surface
sympathy
and
affection
and
tender
ministry
are
wrought
into
the
very
and
glow
in
the
brown
loaves
as
they
come
out
of
the
oven
and
are
specially
seen
in
the
shortcake
for
tea
and
the
favourite
dish
at
dinner
and
the
unexpected
dumpling
among
the
working
classes
too
it
is
true
only
of
them
the
meals
are
the
breathing
spaces
of
humanity
the
resting
spots
where
the
members
of
the
household
come
together
to
see
each
other
faces
for
a
moment
at
leisure
and
to
confer
over
matters
of
common
interest
that
have
no
chance
in
the
rush
and
the
whirl
of
the
hours
of
toil
at
any
rate
i
know
there
was
much
more
than
the
mere
taste
of
the
coffee
in
the
cups
that
diana
filled
and
knowlton
emptied
much
more
than
the
supply
of
bodily
want
in
the
bread
they
eat
the
repast
was
prolonged
and
varied
with
very
much
talk
but
it
was
done
at
last
the
kettle
was
set
on
one
side
the
table
pushed
back
and
evan
looked
at
his
watch
still
talk
went
on
quietly
for
a
good
while
longer
at
what
hour
does
your
chief
of
staff
open
his
barn
doors
said
evan
looking
at
his
watch
again
early
said
diana
not
showing
the
the
question
had
given
her
not
till
it
is
light
though
it
will
be
desirable
that
i
should
get
off
before
light
then
it
is
not
best
to
astonish
him
on
this
occasion
it
is
not
near
light
yet
evan
he
laughed
and
looked
at
her
do
you
know
i
do
know
when
that
moment
comes
i
have
not
seen
it
once
since
i
have
been
at
elmfield
it
shows
how
little
truth
there
is
in
the
theories
of
education
diana
did
not
ask
what
he
meant
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
it
was
profoundly
dark
yet
it
was
also
still
the
rain
was
not
falling
the
wind
had
ceased
hush
and
darkness
were
abroad
she
came
back
to
the
fire
and
asked
what
it
was
evan
looked
they
had
an
hour
yet
but
it
was
an
hour
they
could
make
little
use
of
the
night
was
gone
they
stood
side
by
side
on
the
hearth
evan
arm
round
her
now
and
then
repeating
something
which
had
been
already
spoken
of
really
endeavouring
to
make
the
most
of
the
mere
fact
of
being
together
but
the
minutes
went
too
fast
again
and
again
diana
went
to
the
window
the
second
time
saw
with
that
nameless
pang
at
her
heart
that
the
eastern
horizon
was
taking
the
grey
grave
light
of
coming
dawn
knowlton
went
out
then
presently
saddled
his
horse
and
brought
him
out
to
the
fence
all
ready
for
a
few
minutes
they
waited
yet
and
watched
the
grey
light
creeping
up
then
before
anything
was
clearly
discernible
through
the
dusky
gloom
the
last
farewell
was
taken
evan
mounted
and
walked
his
horse
softly
away
from
the
door
chapter
xii
the
ashes
of
the
fire
diana
sat
down
with
her
face
in
her
hands
and
was
still
she
felt
like
a
person
stunned
it
was
very
still
all
around
her
the
fire
gently
breathed
and
snapped
the
living
presence
that
had
been
there
was
gone
a
great
feeling
of
loneliness
smote
her
but
there
was
leisure
for
few
tears
just
then
and
too
a
state
of
the
nerves
to
seek
much
indulgence
in
them
a
little
while
and
josiah
would
be
there
with
his
pails
of
milk
there
was
something
to
be
done
first
and
quick
as
another
look
from
the
window
assured
her
things
were
becoming
visible
out
of
doors
diana
roused
herself
though
every
movement
had
to
be
with
pain
and
went
about
her
work
it
was
hard
to
move
the
chair
in
which
evan
had
been
sitting
it
was
hard
to
move
the
table
around
which
they
had
been
so
happy
even
that
little
trace
of
last
night
could
not
be
kept
evan
cup
evan
plate
the
bit
of
bread
he
had
left
on
it
diana
fingers
were
dilatory
and
unwilling
in
dealing
with
them
but
then
she
roused
herself
and
dallied
no
longer
table
and
cups
and
eatables
were
safely
removed
the
kitchen
brushed
up
and
the
table
set
for
breakfast
the
fire
made
in
the
outer
stove
and
the
kettle
put
on
though
the
touch
of
the
kettle
hurt
her
fingers
remembering
when
she
had
touched
it
last
every
circumstance
was
put
out
of
the
way
and
the
night
of
watching
locked
up
among
the
most
precious
stores
of
diana
memory
she
opened
the
door
then
the
morning
was
rising
fair
clouds
and
wind
had
wearied
themselves
out
as
it
might
be
and
nature
was
in
a
great
hush
racks
of
vapour
were
scattered
overhead
slowly
moving
away
in
some
current
of
air
that
carried
them
but
below
there
was
not
a
breath
stirring
a
little
drip
drip
from
the
leaves
only
told
how
heavily
they
had
been
surcharged
the
long
pendent
branches
of
the
elm
hung
moveless
as
if
they
were
resting
after
last
night
thrashing
about
and
as
diana
looked
the
touches
of
gold
began
to
come
upon
the
hills
and
then
on
the
it
was
lovely
and
fair
as
ever
but
to
diana
it
was
a
changed
world
she
was
not
the
same
and
nothing
would
ever
be
just
the
same
as
yesterday
it
had
been
she
felt
that
as
she
looked
she
had
lost
and
she
had
gained
just
now
the
loss
came
keenest
the
world
seemed
singularly
empty
the
noise
of
entering
feet
behind
her
brought
her
back
to
common
life
it
was
josiah
and
the
milk
pails
hai
set
up
all
night
hev
ye
was
josiah
startling
remark
i
vow
you
get
the
start
of
the
old
lady
herself
i
ready
for
breakfast
yet
if
you
be
it
will
be
ready
soon
josiah
mornin
is
gettin
short
josiah
went
on
one
o
them
pesky
barn
doors
got
loose
in
the
night
and
it
beat
itself
off
the
hinges
i
guess
i
must
see
and
get
it
fixed
afore
mis
round
or
she
be
hoppin
the
wind
was
enough
to
take
the
ruff
off
but
how
it
could
lift
that
heavy
latch
i
do
see
diana
went
to
the
dairy
without
any
discussion
of
the
subject
coming
back
to
the
kitchen
she
was
equally
startled
and
dismayed
to
see
her
mother
entering
by
the
inner
door
if
there
was
one
thing
diana
longed
for
this
morning
it
was
to
be
alone
josiah
and
the
farm
boys
were
hardly
a
hindrance
she
had
thought
her
mother
could
not
be
are
you
fit
to
be
mother
she
exclaimed
might
as
well
be
down
as
up
said
starling
ca
get
well
lying
in
bed
i
tired
to
death
with
it
all
these
days
and
last
night
i
could
sleep
half
the
night
seemed
to
me
i
heard
all
sorts
of
noises
if
i
had
a
light
i
ha
got
up
then
i
thought
the
house
was
coming
down
about
my
ears
and
if
it
was
i
rather
be
up
to
see
the
wind
blew
so
you
heard
it
too
did
you
when
did
you
come
down
diana
i
heard
the
first
sound
of
your
door
light
was
it
i
have
been
up
a
good
while
but
you
are
not
fit
to
do
the
least
thing
mother
i
was
going
to
bring
you
your
breakfast
if
there
a
thing
i
hate
it
to
have
my
meals
in
bed
i
do
want
anything
to
begin
with
and
i
can
take
it
better
here
what
have
you
got
diana
you
may
make
me
a
cup
of
tea
i
do
feel
as
though
i
could
touch
coffee
what
the
use
o
gettin
up
so
early
i
all
to
do
you
know
mother
no
use
in
burning
wood
and
lights
half
the
night
though
the
long
enough
when
did
you
bake
diana
answered
this
and
several
other
similar
household
questions
and
got
her
mother
a
cup
of
tea
but
though
it
was
accompanied
with
a
nice
bit
of
toast
starling
looked
with
a
dissatisfied
air
at
the
more
substantial
breakfast
her
daughter
was
setting
on
the
table
i
never
could
eat
slops
diana
you
may
give
me
some
o
that
pork
and
a
potato
mother
i
do
not
believe
it
is
good
for
you
good
for
me
and
i
have
eat
it
all
my
life
but
when
you
were
well
i
well
enough
put
some
of
the
gravy
on
diana
i
never
get
my
strength
back
on
toasted
chips
the
men
came
in
and
starling
held
an
animated
dialogue
with
her
factotum
about
farm
affairs
while
diana
sat
behind
her
big
not
the
one
she
had
used
last
night
and
wondered
if
that
was
all
a
dream
more
sadly
if
she
should
ever
dream
again
and
why
her
mother
could
not
have
staid
in
her
room
one
day
more
one
day
more
he
hai
begun
to
get
his
ploughing
ahead
said
starling
as
the
door
closed
on
the
delinquent
what
mother
diana
asked
starting
ploughing
you
have
kept
things
as
i
see
returned
her
mother
josiah
all
behind
as
usual
if
i
could
be
a
man
half
the
time
i
could
get
on
he
ought
to
have
had
the
whole
west
field
ploughed
while
i
been
sick
i
do
know
so
much
about
it
as
you
do
mother
i
know
you
do
you
have
too
much
readin
to
do
there
a
pane
of
glass
broken
in
that
window
diana
yes
mother
i
know
it
how
did
it
come
i
do
know
you
never
get
along
diana
till
you
know
everything
that
happens
in
your
house
you
are
fit
anyhow
to
be
a
poor
woman
if
rich
why
you
can
get
a
new
pane
of
glass
and
there
the
end
of
it
i
not
so
rich
as
all
that
comes
to
getting
a
pane
of
glass
mother
without
knowing
what
for
but
how
does
it
help
the
matter
to
know
what
for
the
glass
must
be
got
anyway
if
you
know
what
for
it
wo
be
to
do
another
time
you
find
a
way
to
stop
it
i
warrant
now
diana
you
have
had
the
ashes
cleared
out
of
that
stove
for
a
week
why
mother
it
smokes
it
always
does
smoke
when
it
gets
full
of
ashes
and
it
never
smokes
when
it
ai
there
is
no
smoke
surely
i
smell
it
i
can
smell
anything
there
is
about
i
do
know
whatever
there
was
in
the
house
last
night
that
smelled
like
coffee
but
i
thought
there
was
somebody
makin
it
i
smelled
it
as
plain
as
could
be
if
i
could
ha
got
into
my
shoes
i
believe
i
would
ha
come
down
to
see
just
to
get
rid
of
the
notion
it
worried
me
so
it
beats
me
now
what
it
could
ha
been
diana
turned
away
with
the
cups
she
had
been
wiping
that
she
might
not
show
her
face
do
you
never
have
your
ashes
took
up
diana
cried
starling
who
when
much
exercised
on
household
matters
sometimes
forgot
her
grammar
yes
mother
when
did
you
have
took
up
in
this
chimney
i
do
not
remember
yesterday
i
guess
said
diana
vaguely
you
never
burnt
all
the
ashes
there
is
there
since
yesterday
morning
you
have
had
to
sit
up
all
night
to
do
it
and
burn
a
good
lot
wood
on
your
fire
too
mother
exclaimed
diana
in
desperation
i
do
suppose
everything
is
just
as
it
would
be
if
you
been
round
all
these
days
i
guess
it
ai
said
starling
there
where
you
are
wanting
diana
your
hands
are
good
enough
but
i
would
give
much
for
your
eyes
there
where
you
grow
poor
if
you
were
poor
now
you
did
know
when
that
pane
o
glass
was
broke
you
go
round
and
round
and
a
pane
o
glass
knock
out
here
and
a
quart
of
oil
leak
out
there
and
you
lose
a
pound
of
flour
between
the
sieve
and
the
barrel
and
you
never
know
how
or
where
mother
said
diana
you
know
i
spill
flour
or
anything
else
no
more
than
you
do
no
but
it
would
go
i
mean
and
you
never
the
wiser
it
ai
the
way
to
get
along
unless
you
mean
to
marry
a
rich
man
now
look
at
that
heap
o
ashes
i
declare
it
beats
me
to
know
what
you
been
doing
to
burn
so
much
wood
here
and
mild
weather
too
who
has
been
here
to
see
you
since
i
been
laid
up
several
people
came
to
ask
about
you
who
did
and
who
did
that
came
at
all
joe
bartlett
and
masters
and
delamater
i
ca
tell
you
all
mother
there
been
a
good
many
tell
me
the
men
that
have
been
here
well
those
i
said
and
will
flandin
and
nick
and
mr
knowlton
was
here
more
than
once
yes
how
much
more
mother
how
do
i
know
i
did
keep
count
did
keep
count
eh
starling
repeated
must
have
been
frequent
company
i
judge
diana
you
mind
what
i
told
you
diana
made
no
answer
you
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
starling
went
on
you
never
shall
you
take
up
with
any
one
that
holds
himself
above
me
i
be
glad
when
his
time
up
and
i
hope
it
be
long
before
he
have
another
once
he
gets
away
he
think
no
more
of
that
one
comfort
diana
knew
that
was
not
true
but
it
hurt
her
to
have
it
said
she
could
stand
no
more
of
her
mother
talk
she
left
her
and
went
off
to
the
dairy
till
starling
crept
again
then
diana
came
and
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
for
a
breath
of
refreshment
the
morning
was
going
on
its
way
in
beauty
little
clouds
drifted
over
the
deep
blue
sky
the
mellow
september
light
lay
on
fields
and
hills
the
long
branches
of
the
elm
swayed
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
gentle
air
that
drove
the
clouds
but
oh
for
the
wind
and
the
storm
of
last
night
and
the
figure
that
stood
beside
her
before
the
chimney
fire
the
gladsome
light
seemed
to
mock
her
and
the
soft
breeze
gave
her
touches
of
pain
she
shut
the
door
and
went
back
to
her
work
chapter
xiii
from
the
post
office
starling
room
was
like
her
for
use
and
not
for
show
with
some
points
of
pride
and
a
general
air
of
humble
thrift
a
patchwork
quilt
on
the
bed
curtains
and
valance
of
chintz
a
rag
carpet
covering
only
part
of
the
floor
the
rest
scrubbed
clean
chairs
and
with
those
a
secretary
bureau
of
old
mahogany
a
in
a
dark
carved
frame
and
a
large
oaken
press
there
were
corner
cupboards
a
table
holding
work
and
a
in
a
corner
a
little
iron
stove
but
no
fire
starling
lay
down
on
her
bed
simply
because
she
was
not
able
to
sit
up
any
longer
but
she
was
scarcely
less
busy
in
truth
than
she
had
been
her
eyes
roamed
restlessly
from
the
door
to
the
window
though
with
never
a
thought
of
the
sweet
september
sunlight
on
the
brilliant
blue
sky
diana
queer
this
morning
she
mused
yes
she
was
queer
what
made
her
so
mum
she
was
not
like
herself
sailing
round
with
her
head
in
the
clouds
and
a
little
bit
too
what
diana
never
is
but
she
was
what
up
i
been
lying
here
long
enough
for
plenty
of
things
to
happen
and
she
had
the
house
to
herself
knowlton
has
been
here
she
owned
that
well
either
he
has
been
here
too
often
or
not
often
enough
i
find
out
which
she
thinkin
about
him
then
that
coffee
it
coffee
last
night
i
could
have
sworn
to
it
just
the
smell
of
fresh
steaming
coffee
i
did
dream
it
she
surprised
either
she
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
she
would
have
laughed
at
it
once
and
the
ashes
in
the
chimney
there
been
a
sight
o
wood
burned
there
and
just
burned
too
they
lay
light
and
been
swep
up
there
mischief
but
diana
never
shall
go
off
with
that
young
feller
never
never
maybe
she
wo
have
will
flandin
but
she
have
him
starling
lay
thinking
and
staring
out
of
her
window
till
she
felt
she
could
go
again
and
then
she
watched
but
diana
had
put
every
possible
circumstance
out
of
the
way
the
very
ashes
were
no
longer
where
her
mother
could
speculate
upon
them
pies
and
cakes
showed
no
more
halves
or
quarters
she
had
even
been
out
to
the
barn
and
found
that
josiah
for
reasons
of
his
own
was
making
the
and
hinges
firm
and
fast
it
was
no
time
now
to
tell
her
mother
her
secret
her
heart
was
too
sore
to
brave
the
rasping
speech
she
would
be
certain
to
provoke
and
with
a
widely
different
feeling
it
was
too
rich
in
its
prize
to
drag
the
treasure
forth
before
scornful
eyes
for
this
was
part
of
diana
experience
she
found
and
the
feeling
grew
the
feeling
of
being
rich
in
her
secret
possession
rich
as
she
never
had
been
before
perhaps
the
richer
for
the
secresy
it
was
all
hers
this
beautiful
wonderful
love
that
had
come
to
her
this
share
in
another
person
heart
and
life
her
own
wholly
no
one
might
intermeddle
with
her
joy
she
treasured
it
and
gloated
over
it
in
the
depths
of
her
glad
consciousness
and
so
as
the
days
went
by
there
was
no
change
that
her
mother
could
see
in
the
sweet
lines
of
her
daughter
face
nothing
less
sweet
than
usual
nothing
less
bright
and
free
if
the
eyes
had
a
deeper
depth
at
times
it
was
not
for
starling
to
penetrate
and
if
the
childlike
play
of
the
mouth
had
a
curve
of
beauty
that
had
never
until
then
belonged
to
it
the
archetype
of
such
a
sign
did
not
lie
in
starling
nature
yet
once
or
twice
a
jealous
movement
of
suspicion
did
rise
in
her
only
because
diana
seemed
so
happy
she
reasoned
with
herself
immediately
that
evan
absence
could
never
have
such
an
effect
if
her
fears
were
true
and
that
the
happiness
must
therefore
be
referred
to
some
purely
innocent
cause
nevertheless
starling
watched
for
she
was
pretty
sure
that
the
young
soldier
had
pushed
his
advances
while
he
had
been
in
pleasant
valley
and
he
might
push
them
still
though
there
no
longer
she
would
guard
what
could
be
guarded
she
watched
both
diana
and
other
people
and
kept
an
especial
eye
upon
all
that
came
from
the
post
office
evan
had
gone
to
a
distant
frontier
post
the
journey
would
take
some
time
and
it
would
be
several
days
more
still
in
the
natural
course
of
things
before
diana
could
have
a
letter
diana
reasoned
out
all
that
and
was
not
anxious
for
the
present
the
pleasure
of
expecting
was
enough
a
letter
from
it
was
a
fairylandish
weird
wonderful
pleasure
to
come
to
her
she
took
to
studying
the
newspaper
and
covertly
the
map
from
the
map
she
gained
a
little
knowledge
but
the
columns
of
the
paper
were
barren
of
all
allusion
to
the
matter
which
was
her
world
and
evan
newspapers
are
very
partial
sometimes
she
was
afraid
to
let
her
mother
see
how
eagerly
she
scanned
them
the
map
and
diana
had
secret
and
more
satisfactory
consultations
measuring
the
probable
route
of
evan
journey
by
the
scale
of
miles
calculating
the
rate
of
progress
by
different
modes
of
travel
counting
the
nights
and
places
where
he
might
spend
them
she
reckoned
up
over
and
over
again
the
days
that
were
probably
necessary
to
enable
him
to
reach
his
post
then
she
allowed
margins
for
what
she
did
not
know
and
accounted
for
the
blanks
she
could
not
fill
up
and
reasoned
with
herself
about
the
engrossments
which
might
on
his
first
arrival
hinder
evan
from
writing
for
a
few
hours
or
a
night
so
at
last
she
had
constructed
a
scheme
by
which
she
proved
to
herself
the
earliest
day
at
which
it
would
do
to
look
for
a
letter
and
the
latest
to
which
a
letter
might
reasonably
be
delayed
women
do
such
things
how
many
men
are
worthy
of
it
that
farthest
limit
was
reached
and
no
letter
yet
about
that
time
one
morning
the
family
at
elmfield
were
gathered
at
breakfast
it
was
not
exactly
like
any
other
breakfast
table
in
pleasant
valley
for
a
certain
drift
from
the
great
waves
of
the
world
had
reached
it
whereas
the
others
were
clean
from
any
such
contact
the
first
and
the
third
generation
were
represented
at
the
table
the
second
was
wanting
the
old
gentleman
the
head
of
the
family
was
surrounded
by
only
his
now
old
bowdoin
was
as
simple
and
a
man
as
all
his
country
neighbours
if
somewhat
richer
than
most
of
them
he
had
wrought
at
the
same
labour
and
grown
up
with
the
same
associations
he
was
not
more
respectable
than
respected
generous
honest
and
kindly
but
the
young
ladies
his
grandchildren
evan
sisters
were
different
they
came
to
spend
the
summer
with
him
and
they
brought
fancies
and
notions
from
their
city
life
which
made
a
somewhat
incongruous
mixture
with
the
elemental
simplicity
of
their
grandfather
house
all
this
appeared
now
the
old
farmer
plain
strong
features
his
homespun
dress
and
his
bowl
of
milk
were
at
one
end
of
the
table
where
he
presided
heartily
over
the
fried
ham
and
eggs
look
where
you
would
beside
and
you
saw
ruffled
chintzes
and
little
and
fingers
with
jewels
on
them
miss
euphemia
had
her
tresses
of
long
hair
unbound
and
unbraided
hanging
down
her
back
in
a
style
that
to
her
grandfather
savoured
of
barbarism
he
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
it
was
a
token
of
the
highest
elegance
for
these
ladies
there
was
some
attempt
at
elaborate
and
dainty
cookery
signified
by
sweetbreads
and
a
puffed
omelette
and
reverdy
presided
over
a
that
was
the
wonder
of
the
elmfield
household
and
even
a
little
matter
of
pride
to
the
old
squire
himself
though
he
covered
it
with
laughing
at
her
mimic
fires
and
doubtful
steam
engines
gertrude
masters
was
still
at
elmfield
the
only
one
left
of
a
tribe
of
visitors
who
had
made
the
old
place
gay
through
the
summer
i
have
had
an
invitation
said
reverdy
as
she
sent
her
grandfather
his
cup
of
coffee
and
she
laughed
i
wish
i
could
give
the
impression
of
this
little
laugh
of
hers
which
in
company
was
the
attendant
of
most
of
her
speeches
a
little
gracious
laugh
with
a
funny
air
as
if
she
were
condescending
either
to
her
subject
or
herself
and
amused
at
it
what
is
it
vevay
what
invitation
inquired
her
sister
while
gertrude
tossed
her
mass
of
tresses
from
her
neck
and
looked
as
if
nothing
at
pleasant
valley
concerned
an
invitation
to
the
sewing
society
said
reverdy
we
are
all
asked
and
the
laugh
grew
very
amused
indeed
what
do
they
do
inquired
gertrude
absently
o
they
bring
their
knitting
at
two
or
three
and
have
a
good
time
to
tell
all
the
news
till
five
or
six
and
then
they
have
supper
and
then
they
put
up
their
knitting
and
go
home
what
news
can
they
have
to
tell
at
pleasant
valley
whose
hay
is
in
first
and
whose
orchard
will
yield
the
most
cider
said
euphemia
yes
and
how
all
their
children
are
and
how
many
eggs
go
in
a
pudding
i
do
believe
they
make
puddings
with
eggs
very
often
said
the
other
sister
again
their
puddings
are
more
like
hasty
puddings
i
fancy
some
of
make
pretty
good
things
said
old
bowdoin
things
you
ca
beat
phemie
there
mansfield
she
a
capital
housekeeper
and
starling
can
cook
what
do
they
expect
you
to
do
at
the
sewing
meeting
vevay
show
myself
i
suppose
said
reverdy
well
i
guess
i
go
said
her
grandfather
looking
at
her
it
would
be
as
good
a
thing
as
you
could
do
go
grandpa
o
how
ridiculous
exclaimed
reverdy
with
her
pretty
face
all
wrinkled
up
with
amusement
go
yes
why
not
i
do
know
how
to
knit
and
i
should
know
how
to
talk
orchards
and
puddings
i
think
you
had
better
go
it
is
not
a
knitting
society
as
i
understand
it
and
i
am
sure
you
can
be
useful
useful
echoed
reverdy
it
the
last
thing
i
know
how
to
be
and
i
do
belong
to
the
society
grandpa
i
should
like
them
to
think
that
said
the
old
gentleman
you
belong
to
me
and
i
belong
to
them
my
dear
is
it
dreadful
said
reverdy
in
a
low
aside
now
he
got
this
in
his
head
whatever
am
i
going
to
do
suppose
i
invite
them
all
to
elmfield
how
would
you
like
that
sir
she
added
aloud
yes
my
dear
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
pushing
back
his
chair
for
the
cup
of
coffee
was
the
last
part
of
his
breakfast
it
would
be
well
done
and
i
should
be
glad
of
it
ask
all
you
are
in
for
it
now
vevay
said
gertrude
when
the
ladies
were
left
how
will
you
manage
o
i
give
them
a
grand
entertainment
and
send
them
away
delighted
said
reverdy
you
see
grandpa
wishes
it
and
i
think
it
be
fun
do
you
suppose
evan
really
paid
attentions
to
that
pretty
girl
we
saw
at
the
blackberrying
i
do
know
reverdy
answered
he
told
me
nothing
about
it
i
should
think
evan
was
crazy
to
do
it
but
men
do
crazy
things
however
i
do
believe
it
of
him
gerty
what
nonsense
i
can
find
out
if
she
comes
said
miss
masters
you
ask
her
genevieve
so
it
fell
out
that
an
invitation
to
hold
the
next
meeting
of
the
sewing
society
at
elmfield
was
sent
to
the
ladies
accustomed
to
be
at
such
meetings
and
a
great
stir
of
expectation
in
consequence
went
through
all
pleasant
valley
for
elmfield
whether
they
acknowledged
it
or
not
was
at
the
top
of
their
social
tree
the
invitation
came
in
due
course
to
starling
house
it
came
not
alone
josiah
brought
it
one
evening
on
his
return
from
the
corners
where
the
store
and
the
post
office
were
and
messenger
had
fallen
in
with
him
and
intrusted
to
him
the
note
for
starling
he
handed
it
out
now
and
with
it
a
letter
of
more
bulk
and
pretensions
having
a
double
stamp
and
an
unknown
postmark
starling
received
both
and
josiah
explanations
in
silence
for
her
mind
was
very
busy
curious
as
she
was
to
know
upon
what
subject
reverdy
could
possibly
have
written
to
her
she
lingered
yet
with
her
eyes
upon
this
other
letter
it
was
directed
to
miss
d
starling
that
a
man
hand
said
starling
to
herself
he
had
the
assurance
to
go
and
write
to
her
i
do
believe
she
stood
looking
at
it
doubtful
suspicious
uneasy
then
turned
into
the
dairy
for
fear
diana
might
surprise
her
while
she
opened
reverdy
note
she
had
a
vague
idea
that
both
epistles
might
relate
to
the
same
subject
but
this
one
was
innocent
enough
at
least
hiding
the
large
letter
in
her
bosom
she
came
back
and
gave
the
invitation
to
diana
whose
foot
she
had
heard
at
elmfield
what
an
odd
thing
will
you
go
mother
i
always
go
do
i
what
the
reason
i
should
go
now
i
did
know
whether
you
would
like
to
go
there
what
if
i
do
no
i
do
care
particularly
about
goin
to
elmfield
they
a
kind
o
stuck
up
folks
but
i
go
to
let
them
see
that
i
ai
there
was
silence
for
a
little
then
starling
broke
it
by
inquiring
if
diana
had
finished
her
chintz
gown
diana
had
i
wear
it
if
i
was
you
why
mother
let
see
that
other
folks
can
dress
as
well
as
them
o
mother
my
dresses
are
nothing
alongside
of
theirs
what
the
reason
they
ai
inquired
starling
looking
incredulous
their
things
are
beautiful
mother
more
costly
a
great
deal
and
fashionable
we
ca
make
things
so
in
pleasant
valley
we
do
know
how
i
do
see
any
sense
in
that
rejoined
starling
one
as
good
as
another
anyhow
there
folks
in
pleasant
valley
than
ever
called
themselves
bowdoin
or
knowlton
either
so
be
as
smart
as
you
can
diana
i
guess
you
need
be
ashamed
of
yourself
diana
thought
of
nothing
less
indeed
she
thought
little
about
her
appearance
while
she
was
putting
on
her
bright
chintz
dress
there
was
perhaps
a
movement
of
desire
that
she
might
seem
pleasant
in
the
eyes
of
evan
people
something
that
need
not
be
ashamed
of
but
her
heart
was
too
full
of
richer
thoughts
to
have
much
room
for
such
as
these
for
evan
had
chosen
her
evan
loved
her
the
secret
bond
between
them
nothing
on
earth
could
undo
and
any
day
now
that
first
letter
of
his
might
arrive
which
her
eyes
were
bright
only
to
think
of
looking
upon
poor
diana
that
letter
was
jammed
up
within
the
bones
of
starling
stays
chapter
xiv
a
meeting
at
elmfield
it
was
one
of
the
royal
days
of
a
new
england
autumn
the
air
clear
and
bracing
and
spicy
the
light
golden
and
glowing
and
yet
softened
to
the
dreamiest
richest
most
bounteous
aureole
of
hope
by
a
slight
impalpable
haze
too
slight
to
veil
anything
but
giving
its
tender
flattery
to
the
landscape
nevertheless
and
through
that
to
the
mind
who
can
help
but
receive
it
suggestions
of
waveless
peace
of
endless
delight
of
a
glory
that
must
fill
one
life
with
riches
come
through
such
a
light
and
under
such
a
sky
diana
life
was
full
already
but
she
took
the
promise
for
all
the
years
that
stretched
out
in
the
future
the
soft
autumn
sky
where
the
clouds
were
at
rest
having
done
their
work
bore
no
symbol
of
the
storms
that
might
come
beneath
the
firmament
the
purple
and
gold
and
crimson
of
nature
gala
dress
seemed
to
fling
their
soft
luxury
around
the
beholder
enfolding
him
as
it
were
from
all
the
dust
and
the
dimness
and
the
dullness
of
this
world
working
days
for
evermore
so
it
was
to
diana
and
all
the
miles
of
that
long
drive
joggingly
pulled
along
by
prince
she
rode
in
a
chariot
of
the
imagination
traversing
fields
of
thought
and
of
space
now
to
evan
and
now
with
him
and
in
her
engrossment
spoke
never
a
word
from
the
time
she
mounted
into
the
waggon
till
they
came
in
sight
of
elmfield
and
starling
had
her
own
subjects
for
thought
and
was
as
silent
on
her
part
she
was
thinking
all
the
way
what
she
should
do
with
that
letter
suppose
things
had
gone
too
far
to
be
stopped
but
diana
had
told
her
nothing
she
was
not
bound
to
know
by
and
if
this
were
the
of
serious
proposals
then
it
were
better
known
to
but
herself
only
she
resolved
finally
to
watch
diana
and
the
elmfield
people
this
afternoon
she
could
find
out
she
thought
whether
there
were
any
matter
of
common
interest
between
them
with
all
this
starling
temper
was
not
sweetened
elmfield
was
a
rare
place
not
by
the
work
of
art
or
the
craft
of
the
gardener
at
all
for
a
cunning
workman
had
never
touched
its
turf
or
its
plantations
indeed
it
had
no
plantations
other
than
such
as
were
intended
for
pure
use
and
profit
great
fields
of
indian
corn
and
acres
of
wheat
and
rye
and
a
plot
of
garden
cabbages
power
of
reform
had
reached
only
the
household
affairs
but
the
corn
and
the
rye
and
the
cabbages
were
out
of
sight
from
the
immediate
home
field
and
there
the
grace
of
nature
had
been
so
great
that
one
almost
forgot
to
wish
that
anything
had
been
added
to
it
a
little
river
swept
curving
in
sweet
leisure
through
a
large
level
tract
of
greenest
meadows
in
front
of
one
of
these
large
curves
the
house
stood
but
well
back
so
that
the
meadow
served
instead
of
a
lawn
it
had
no
foreign
beauties
of
tree
growth
to
adorn
it
nor
needed
them
for
along
the
bank
of
the
river
from
space
to
space
irregularly
rose
a
huge
new
england
elm
giving
the
shelter
of
its
canopy
of
branches
to
a
wide
spot
of
turf
the
house
added
nothing
to
the
scene
beyond
the
human
interest
it
was
just
a
large
old
farmhouse
nothing
more
draped
however
and
half
covered
up
by
other
elms
and
a
few
fir
trees
but
in
front
of
it
lay
this
wide
sunny
level
meadow
with
the
wilful
little
stream
meandering
through
with
the
stately
old
trees
spotting
it
and
breaking
its
monotony
and
in
the
distance
a
soft
outline
of
hills
not
too
far
away
and
varied
enough
to
be
picturesque
rounded
in
the
whole
picture
a
picture
one
would
stand
long
to
look
at
thoroughly
new
england
and
characteristic
gentle
homelike
lovely
with
just
a
touch
of
wildness
intimating
that
you
were
beyond
the
rules
of
conventionality
being
new
england
folk
themselves
starling
and
diana
of
course
would
not
read
some
of
these
features
they
only
thought
it
was
a
fine
place
long
before
they
got
there
this
afternoon
before
anybody
got
there
the
ladies
of
the
family
gathered
upon
the
wide
old
piazza
it
as
a
good
as
a
play
said
gertrude
masters
i
never
saw
such
society
in
my
life
and
i
am
curious
to
know
what
they
will
be
like
you
have
seen
them
in
church
said
euphemia
yes
but
they
all
feel
poky
there
i
ca
tell
anything
by
that
besides
i
do
hear
them
talk
there
somebody
now
too
fast
for
any
of
our
good
sewing
friends
said
reverdy
and
there
is
no
waggon
it
masters
gerty
how
he
does
ride
and
yet
he
sits
as
if
he
was
upon
a
i
do
think
he
sit
very
quiet
upon
a
said
gerty
and
then
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
shouted
musically
a
salutation
to
the
approaching
rider
he
alighted
presently
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
throwing
the
bridle
over
his
horse
head
joined
the
party
so
delighted
said
reverdy
graciously
you
are
come
just
in
time
to
help
us
take
care
of
the
people
are
you
going
to
entertain
the
nation
asked
mr
masters
only
pleasant
valley
reverdy
answered
with
her
little
laugh
which
might
mean
amusement
at
herself
or
condescension
to
pleasant
valley
do
you
think
they
will
be
hard
to
entertain
i
can
answer
for
one
said
the
minister
and
looking
at
what
there
is
to
see
from
here
i
could
almost
answer
for
them
all
he
was
considering
the
wide
sunlit
meadow
where
the
green
and
the
gold
yea
and
the
very
elm
shadows
as
well
as
the
distant
hills
were
spiritualized
by
the
slight
soft
haze
why
what
is
there
to
see
basil
inquired
his
cousin
gertrude
the
sky
you
do
think
that
is
entertaining
i
hope
if
you
were
a
polite
man
you
would
have
said
something
else
she
was
something
to
see
herself
in
one
sense
and
the
something
was
pretty
too
but
very
from
her
flow
of
curly
tresses
down
to
the
rosettes
on
her
slippers
every
inch
of
her
showed
it
now
the
best
dressing
surely
avoids
this
effect
while
there
is
some
and
not
bad
dressing
either
which
proclaims
it
in
every
detail
the
crinkles
of
gertrude
hair
were
crisp
with
it
her
french
print
dress
beautiful
in
itself
was
made
with
french
daintiness
and
worn
with
at
least
equal
coquettishness
her
wrists
bore
two
or
three
bracelets
both
valuable
and
delicate
and
gertrude
eyes
pretty
eyes
too
were
audacious
with
the
knowledge
of
all
this
audacious
in
a
sweet
secret
way
understand
they
were
not
bold
eyes
openly
her
cousin
looked
her
over
with
a
glance
quite
recognisant
of
all
i
have
described
yet
destitute
of
a
shade
of
compliment
or
even
of
admiration
very
clear
and
very
cool
basil
you
do
say
all
you
think
exclaimed
the
young
lady
not
always
said
her
cousin
we
have
it
on
solomon
authority
that
a
uttereth
all
his
mind
a
wise
man
keepeth
it
till
afterwards
what
are
you
keeping
but
the
answer
was
interrupted
by
reverdy
where
shall
we
put
them
do
you
think
masters
i
quite
anxious
here
on
the
verandah
do
you
think
or
on
the
green
where
we
mean
to
have
supper
or
would
it
be
better
to
go
into
the
house
as
a
general
principle
reverdy
i
object
to
houses
when
you
can
keep
out
of
them
so
i
say
and
there
comes
one
of
your
guests
i
will
take
my
horse
out
of
the
road
reverdy
objected
and
protested
and
ran
to
summon
a
servant
but
the
minister
had
his
way
and
led
his
horse
off
to
the
stable
while
he
was
gone
the
little
old
green
waggon
which
brought
miss
barry
came
at
a
soft
jog
up
the
drive
and
stopped
before
the
door
reverdy
came
flying
out
and
then
down
the
steps
to
help
her
alight
it
a
long
ways
to
your
place
mis
reverdy
i
declare
i
kind
stiff
said
the
old
lady
as
she
mounted
to
the
piazza
there
she
stood
still
and
surveyed
the
prospect
and
her
conclusion
burst
forth
in
an
unequivocal
ai
it
elegant
i
am
delighted
you
like
it
said
reverdy
with
her
running
laugh
wo
you
sit
down
i
hai
got
straightened
out
yet
after
drivin
the
horse
so
long
it
does
put
me
in
a
kind
o
cramp
somehow
to
drive
allays
is
the
horse
so
la
bless
you
i
never
felt
of
his
mouth
he
do
do
nothin
i
expect
he
would
do
nothin
but
i
allays
think
he
a
horse
and
there
no
tellin
that
very
true
said
reverdy
the
laugh
of
condescending
acquiescence
mingled
with
a
little
sense
of
fun
now
but
do
sit
down
you
be
tired
standing
there
flandin
waggin
i
guess
comin
she
was
ready
when
i
come
by
is
this
your
sister
looking
at
gertrude
no
the
other
is
my
sister
this
is
miss
masters
a
cousin
of
your
minister
i
thought
she
was
maybe
your
sister
i
mean
because
she
had
her
hair
the
same
way
ai
it
very
uncomfortable
this
to
gertrude
it
is
very
comfortable
said
the
young
lady
except
in
hot
weather
do
say
it
is
quoth
miss
barry
looking
at
the
astonishing
hair
while
she
got
out
her
needles
seems
to
me
i
should
feel
as
if
my
hair
never
was
combed
not
if
it
combed
would
you
said
gertrude
gravely
well
yes
seems
to
me
i
should
i
allays
liked
to
have
my
hair
sleeked
up
as
tight
as
i
could
get
it
and
then
i
knowed
there
none
of
it
flyin
but
la
it
a
long
time
since
i
was
young
and
there
new
fashions
is
the
minister
your
cousin
yes
how
do
you
like
him
i
hai
got
accustomed
to
him
yet
said
the
little
old
lady
clicking
her
needles
with
a
considerate
air
he
ai
like
hardenburgh
you
see
and
hardenburgh
was
the
minister
afore
him
what
was
the
difference
well
hardenburgh
you
could
tell
he
was
a
minister
as
fur
as
you
could
see
him
he
had
that
look
now
masters
hai
he
just
like
other
folks
only
he
more
pleasant
than
most
oh
he
is
more
pleasant
is
he
well
seems
to
me
he
is
said
the
little
old
lady
it
allays
makes
me
feel
kind
o
good
when
he
comes
alongside
he
cheerful
hardenburgh
a
good
man
but
he
made
me
afeard
of
him
he
was
sort
o
fierce
in
the
pulpit
and
out
o
the
pulpit
masters
ai
nary
one
do
you
think
he
a
good
preacher
then
said
gertrude
demurely
bending
over
to
look
at
miss
barry
knitting
well
i
do
said
the
old
lady
there
i
ai
no
judge
but
i
love
to
sit
and
hear
him
a
bit
like
a
minister
nother
though
in
church
he
just
speaks
like
as
i
am
speakin
to
you
but
he
makes
the
bible
kind
o
interestin
it
was
very
well
for
gertrude
that
carpenter
now
came
to
take
her
seat
on
the
piazza
and
the
conversation
changed
she
had
got
about
as
much
as
she
could
bear
and
after
carpenter
came
a
crowd
flandin
and
mansfield
and
miss
gunn
and
all
the
rest
with
short
interval
driving
up
and
unloading
and
joining
the
circle
on
the
piazza
which
grew
a
very
wide
circle
indeed
and
at
last
broke
up
into
divisions
gertrude
was
obliged
to
suspend
operations
for
a
while
and
use
her
eyes
instead
of
her
tongue
most
of
the
rest
were
inclined
to
do
the
same
and
curious
glances
went
about
in
every
direction
not
missing
miss
masters
herself
some
people
were
absolutely
others
used
their
opportunity
do
the
wind
come
drefful
cold
over
them
flats
in
winter
asked
one
good
lady
who
had
never
been
at
elmfield
before
reverdy
running
little
laugh
was
ready
with
her
answer
i
believe
it
does
but
we
are
never
here
in
winter
it
too
cold
your
here
ai
he
queried
salter
yes
o
yes
grandpa
is
here
of
course
i
do
suppose
anything
would
draw
him
away
from
the
old
place
how
big
is
the
farm
went
on
the
first
speaker
reverdy
did
not
know
three
or
four
hundred
acres
she
believed
or
it
might
be
five
she
did
not
know
the
difference
i
guess
your
father
misses
you
when
you
all
go
away
remarked
flandin
who
had
hardly
spoken
at
least
aloud
the
reply
was
prevented
for
starling
waggon
drew
up
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
reverdy
hastened
down
to
give
her
assistance
to
the
ladies
in
alighting
gertrude
also
suspended
what
she
was
saying
and
gave
her
undivided
attention
to
the
view
of
diana
she
was
only
a
country
girl
miss
masters
said
to
herself
yet
what
a
lovely
figure
as
she
stood
there
before
the
waggon
perfectly
proportioned
light
and
firm
in
action
or
attitude
with
the
grace
of
absolute
health
and
strength
and
faultless
make
more
there
always
is
more
to
it
and
gertrude
felt
that
without
in
the
least
having
power
to
reason
about
it
felt
in
the
quiet
pose
and
soft
motion
those
spirit
indications
of
calm
and
strength
and
gracious
dignity
which
belonged
to
the
fair
proportions
and
wholesome
soundness
of
the
inward
character
the
face
said
the
same
thing
when
it
was
turned
and
diana
came
up
the
steps
though
it
was
seen
under
a
white
only
the
straight
brows
the
large
quiet
eyes
the
soft
creamy
colour
of
the
skin
all
testified
to
the
fine
physical
and
mental
conditions
of
this
creature
and
gertrude
felt
as
she
looked
that
it
would
not
have
been
very
surprising
if
evan
knowlton
or
any
other
young
officer
had
lost
his
heart
to
her
but
she
is
dressed
thought
gertrude
and
the
next
moment
a
shadow
crossed
her
heart
as
diana
came
off
and
a
wealth
of
dark
hair
was
revealed
knotted
into
a
crown
of
devising
which
art
could
never
outdo
i
find
out
about
evan
said
miss
masters
to
herself
she
had
to
wait
the
company
was
large
now
and
the
buzz
of
tongues
considerable
though
nothing
like
what
had
been
in
parlour
so
soon
as
the
two
were
fairly
seated
and
at
work
flandin
took
up
the
broken
thread
of
her
discourse
ai
your
father
kind
o
lonesome
here
in
the
winters
all
by
himself
my
grandfather
you
mean
said
reverdy
i
mean
your
grandfather
i
forget
you
ai
his
own
but
it
makes
no
difference
do
he
want
you
to
hum
all
the
year
round
i
daresay
he
would
like
it
he
gettin
on
in
years
now
how
old
is
squire
bowdoin
i
do
know
said
reverdy
he
between
seventy
and
eighty
somewhere
you
wo
have
him
long
with
you
o
i
hope
so
said
reverdy
lightly
and
with
the
unfailing
laugh
which
went
with
everything
i
think
grandpa
is
stronger
than
i
am
i
should
wonder
if
he
outlive
still
do
you
think
it
is
your
duty
to
stay
with
him
reverdy
laughed
again
i
suppose
we
do
always
do
our
duty
she
said
it
too
cold
here
in
the
winter
after
october
or
september
for
me
then
it
is
not
your
duty
to
be
here
said
her
sister
euphemia
somewhat
distinctly
but
flandin
was
bound
to
free
her
mind
of
what
was
upon
it
i
should
think
the
squire
want
evan
to
hum
she
went
on
it
would
be
very
nice
if
evan
could
be
in
two
places
at
once
reverdy
owned
conciliatingly
where
captain
knowlton
now
asked
boddington
o
he
is
not
a
captain
yet
said
reverdy
he
is
only
a
lieutenant
i
do
know
when
he
get
any
higher
than
that
he
a
great
way
off
on
the
frontier
watching
the
indians
i
should
think
it
was
pleasanter
work
to
watch
sheep
said
flandin
do
it
make
you
feel
bad
to
have
him
away
so
fur
o
we
accustomed
to
having
him
away
you
know
evan
has
never
been
at
home
we
really
do
know
him
as
well
as
strangers
do
we
have
just
got
a
letter
from
him
at
his
new
post
they
had
got
a
letter
from
him
two
bounds
diana
heart
made
the
first
with
a
pang
of
pain
that
they
should
have
the
earliest
word
the
next
with
a
pang
of
joy
at
the
certainty
that
hers
must
be
lying
in
the
post
office
for
her
the
blood
flowed
and
ebbed
in
her
veins
with
the
violent
action
of
extreme
excitement
yet
nature
did
for
this
girl
what
only
the
practice
and
training
of
society
do
for
others
she
gave
no
outward
sign
her
head
was
not
lifted
from
her
work
the
colour
of
her
cheek
did
not
change
and
when
a
moment
after
she
found
miss
masters
at
her
side
and
heard
her
speaking
diana
looked
and
answered
with
the
utmost
seeming
composure
i
been
trying
ever
since
you
came
to
get
round
to
you
gertrude
whispered
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
but
here
flandin
broke
in
she
was
seated
near
ai
your
hair
a
great
trouble
to
you
gertrude
gave
it
a
little
toss
and
looked
up
how
do
you
get
it
all
flying
like
that
everybody
hair
is
a
trouble
said
gertrude
this
is
as
little
as
any
do
you
sleep
with
it
all
round
your
shoulders
i
should
think
you
be
in
a
net
by
morning
i
suppose
you
would
said
gertrude
is
that
the
fashion
now
it
is
one
fashion
miss
masters
responded
if
it
war
i
reckon
you
do
it
up
pretty
quick
dear
me
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
in
the
fashion
i
do
suppose
do
you
like
it
yourself
queried
gertrude
never
try
something
else
to
do
in
life
well
but
there
no
in
being
in
the
fashion
mis
flandin
said
miss
gunn
the
minister
said
he
thought
there
war
the
minister
had
better
take
care
of
himself
flandin
retorted
whereupon
they
all
opened
upon
her
and
it
could
be
seen
that
for
the
few
months
during
which
he
had
been
among
them
the
minister
had
made
swift
progress
in
the
regards
of
the
people
scarce
a
tongue
now
but
spoke
in
his
praise
or
his
justification
or
called
flandin
to
account
for
her
hasty
remark
when
you
all
done
i
speak
said
that
lady
coolly
i
not
a
never
was
and
nobody
fit
to
be
worshipped
should
like
to
see
the
dominie
put
down
that
grey
horse
of
his
are
grey
horses
fashionable
inquired
reverdy
with
her
little
laugh
what
would
he
do
without
his
horse
said
boddington
how
could
he
fly
round
pleasant
valley
as
he
does
he
ai
bound
to
fly
said
flandin
how
he
to
get
round
to
folks
then
said
salter
the
houses
are
pretty
scattering
in
these
parts
he
be
a
spry
man
if
he
could
walk
it
seems
to
me
that
grey
hoss
is
real
handy
said
quiet
miss
barry
who
never
contradicted
anybody
when
meliny
was
sick
masters
be
there
to
our
house
early
in
the
mornin
and
late
at
night
and
he
allays
had
comfort
with
him
there
i
got
to
set
as
much
by
the
sight
o
that
grey
hoss
you
would
think
just
to
hear
him
come
gallopin
down
the
road
did
me
good
yes
and
so
it
was
to
our
house
when
liz
was
overturned
said
mary
delamater
he
be
there
every
day
just
as
punctual
as
could
be
and
he
could
never
have
walked
over
it
a
cruel
piece
of
road
between
our
house
and
i
do
want
him
to
walk
said
flandin
there
more
ways
than
one
o
doin
most
things
but
i
say
all
the
ministers
ever
i
see
druv
a
team
and
it
looks
more
religious
to
see
the
minister
over
the
hills
like
a
racer
is
altogether
too
gay
for
my
likin
but
he
ai
gay
said
miss
gunn
looking
appalled
he
mighty
spry
for
anybody
that
gets
up
into
a
pulpit
on
the
sabbath
and
tells
his
what
they
ought
to
be
doin
but
he
does
do
that
flandin
said
diana
he
speaks
plain
enough
too
i
love
to
hear
him
said
miss
barry
there
his
words
seem
to
go
all
through
me
and
clear
up
my
want
of
understandin
for
i
never
was
smart
you
know
but
seems
to
me
i
see
things
as
well
agin
when
he
been
talkin
to
me
i
say
it
was
a
good
day
when
he
come
to
pleasant
valley
he
ai
what
you
call
an
eloquent
man
said
miss
babbage
the
schoolmaster
sister
what
is
an
man
lottie
babbage
boddington
asked
it
a
word
i
know
but
what
is
the
thing
the
word
means
come
you
ought
to
be
good
at
definitions
masters
do
pretend
to
be
an
eloquent
man
cried
carpenter
well
tell
come
what
do
you
mean
by
it
i
like
to
know
said
boddington
i
admire
to
get
my
idees
straight
what
is
it
he
pretend
to
be
i
do
think
he
pretends
to
be
anything
said
diana
only
to
have
his
own
way
wherever
he
goes
added
diana
mother
i
be
content
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
said
carpenter
it
pretty
sure
to
be
a
good
way
that
what
think
i
wisht
he
had
it
for
my
part
and
yet
he
is
eloquent
said
boddington
well
said
miss
babbage
with
some
difficulty
he
just
says
what
he
has
got
to
say
and
takes
the
handiest
words
he
can
find
but
heard
men
that
eloquent
that
they
keep
you
wonderin
at
from
the
beginning
of
their
sermon
to
the
end
and
you
got
to
be
smart
to
know
what
they
were
sayin
a
child

tell
what
masters
means
so
kin
i
said
miss
barry
i
thankful
i
kin
and
i
do
want
a
man
more
eloquent
than
he
is
for
my
preachin
it
ai
movin
preachin
said
flandin
it

the
folks
said
carpenter
i
do
know
what
hev
mis
flandin
there
liz
delamater
and
florry
mason
jined
the
church
lately
and
old
lupton
and
my
jim
she
added
with
softened
voice
and
there
several
more
serious
no
more
could
be
said
for
the
minister
himself
came
upon
the
scene
at
this
instant
there
was
not
an
eye
that
did
not
brighten
at
the
sight
of
him
with
the
exception
of
starling
and
diana
there
was
not
a
lady
there
who
was
not
manifestly
glad
to
have
him
come
near
and
speak
to
her
even
flandin
herself
beside
whom
the
minister
presently
sat
down
and
entered
into
conversation
respecting
some
new
movement
in
parish
matters
for
which
he
wished
to
enlist
her
help
general
conversation
returned
to
its
usual
channels
i
ca
stand
this
whispered
gertrude
to
diana
i
am
tired
to
death
do
come
down
and
walk
over
to
the
river
with
me
do
you
can
work
another
day
diana
hesitated
glanced
around
her
it
was
manifest
that
this
was
an
exceptional
meeting
of
the
society
and
not
for
the
purposes
of
work
chiefly
here
and
there
needles
were
suspended
in
lingering
fingers
while
their
owners
made
subdued
comments
to
each
other
or
used
their
eyes
for
purposes
of
information
getting
one
or
two
had
even
left
work
and
were
going
to
the
back
of
the
house
through
the
hall
to
see
the
garden
diana
not
very
unwillingly
dropped
her
sewing
and
followed
her
conductor
down
the
steps
and
over
the
meadow
chapter
xv
catechizing
the
sun
is
hot
through
all
this
cloud
said
gertrude
so
i
mind
it
we
get
into
the
shade
under
the
elm
yonder
there
is
no
cloud
said
diana
no
cloud
what
is
it
then
has
come
over
the
sun
no
it
haze
what
is
haze
i
do
know
we
have
it
in
indian
summer
and
sometimes
in
october
like
this
is
it
hot
said
gertrude
and
last
week
we
were
having
big
fires
it
such
queer
weather
now
this
shade
is
nice
under
one
or
two
of
the
elm
canopies
along
the
verge
of
the
little
river
some
rustic
seats
had
been
fixed
gertrude
sat
down
diana
stood
looking
about
her
the
dreamy
beauty
through
which
she
had
ridden
that
afternoon
was
all
round
her
still
and
the
meadow
and
the
scattered
elms
with
the
distant
hills
were
one
of
new
combinations
in
which
the
gentlest
beauty
and
the
most
characteristic
strength
meet
and
mingle
but
what
was
more
yet
to
diana
she
was
among
evan
haunts
here
was
at
home
there
seemed
to
her
fancy
to
be
a
consciousness
of
him
in
the
silent
trees
and
river
as
if
they
would
say
if
they
could
as
if
they
were
saying
mutely
we
know
him
we
know
him
and
we
are
old
friends
of
his
we
could
tell
you
a
great
deal
about
him
elmfield
is
a
pretty
place
said
gertrude
she
had
been
eyeing
her
companion
while
diana
was
receiving
the
confidences
of
the
trees
lovely
if
it
did
grow
so
cold
in
winter
said
the
young
lady
shrugging
her
airy
shoulders
i
like
the
cold
i
should
like
to
have
it
always
hot
enough
to
wear
muslin
dresses
come
sit
down
evan
put
these
seats
here
but
diana
continued
standing
did
you
hear
that
woman
scolding
because
he
do
stay
here
and
give
up
his
army
life
she
takes
her
own
view
of
it
said
diana
do
think
he
ought
to
give
up
everything
to
take
care
of
his
grandfather
i
daresay
his
grandfather
likes
to
have
him
do
as
he
is
doing
but
it
must
be
awfully
hard
must
it
for
them
to
have
him
so
far
away
and
fighting
the
indians
is
he
fighting
the
indians
diana
asked
quietly
though
she
made
the
words
quiet
she
knew
by
sheer
force
of
necessity
but
quiet
they
were
slow
and
showing
no
eagerness
while
her
pulse
had
made
one
mad
jump
and
then
seemed
to
stand
still
o
the
indians
are
always
making
trouble
you
know
on
the
frontier
that
what
our
men
are
there
for
to
watch
them
i
did
mean
that
evan
was
fighting
just
at
this
minute
but
he
might
be
any
minute
should
you
feel
bad
if
he
was
your
brother
reverdy
does
seem
to
be
uneasy
she
no
said
gertrude
with
a
laugh
nothing
makes
uneasy
except
thinking
that
evan
has
fallen
in
love
with
somebody
she
must
expect
that
sooner
or
later
said
diana
with
a
calmness
which
told
her
companion
nothing
ah
but
she
would
rather
have
it
later
she
do
want
to
lose
evan
she
is
very
proud
of
him
would
she
lose
him
in
such
a
case
diana
asked
smiling
though
she
wished
the
talk
ended
why
you
know
brothers
are
good
for
nothing
to
sisters
after
they
are
married
worse
they
are
tantalizing
you
are
obliged
to
see
what
you
used
to
have
in
somebody
else
possession
and
much
more
than
ever
you
used
to
have
and
it
tiresome
i
glad
i
no
brothers
basil
is
a
good
deal
like
a
brother
and
i
am
jealous
of
it
must
be
very
uncomfortable
to
be
jealous
said
diana
horrid
you
saw
a
good
deal
of
evan
did
you
a
question
that
might
have
embarrassed
diana
if
she
had
not
had
an
instant
perception
of
the
intent
of
it
she
answered
thereupon
with
absolute
i
do
know
what
you
would
call
a
deal
i
saw
what
call
a
good
deal
of
him
that
day
in
the
blackberry
field
do
you
think
he
is
charming
diana
laughed
and
was
vexed
to
feel
her
cheeks
grow
warm
that
a
word
that
belongs
to
women
not
to
many
of
said
gertrude
with
a
slight
turning
up
of
her
pretty
nose
then
struck
with
the
fine
pure
face
and
very
lovely
figure
before
her
she
suddenly
added
did
he
think
you
charming
are
you
laughing
at
me
said
diana
no
indeed
i
am
not
did
he
said
gertrude
caressingly
amusement
almost
carried
off
the
temptation
to
be
provoked
diana
laughed
merrily
as
she
answered
do
you
think
a
person
of
so
good
taste
would
yes
i
do
said
gertrude
half
sulkily
for
she
was
baffled
and
besides
her
words
spoke
the
truth
i
am
sure
he
did
is
life
very
stupid
up
here
in
the
mountains
when
visitors
are
all
gone
away
i
do
think
so
we
never
depend
upon
visitors
it
has
been
awfully
slow
at
elmfield
since
knowlton
went
away
we
stay
much
longer
i
ca
live
where
i
ca
dance
what
is
that
said
a
voice
close
at
hand
a
peculiarly
clear
silvery
voice
cousin
basil
cried
gertrude
starting
what
did
you
come
here
for
i
brought
miss
starling
here
to
have
a
good
talk
with
her
have
you
had
it
i
have
had
time
i
was
just
beginning
what
about
dancing
i
was
not
speaking
for
you
to
hear
i
was
relieving
myself
by
the
confession
that
i
ca
live
happily
i
mean
without
it
choice
of
partners
immaterial
i
could
bear
a
dull
life
nor
i
he
looked
as
if
he
certainly
did
not
know
what
dulness
was
diana
thought
she
listened
much
amused
but
you
think
it
is
wrong
to
dance
do
you
gertrude
went
on
not
is
wrong
to
a
christian
he
replied
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
a
christian
because
he
said
with
a
quiet
and
glance
and
tone
of
inquiry
o
because
it
is
slavery
so
many
things
you
can
not
do
and
dresses
you
can
not
wear
by
what
rule
masters
asked
o
people
think
you
are
dreadful
if
you
do
those
things
the
church
and
all
that
so
i
think
it
is
a
great
deal
better
to
keep
out
of
it
and
make
no
pretensions
better
to
keep
out
of
what
let
me
understand
said
the
minister
you
are
getting
my
ideas
in
a
very
involved
state
no
i
am
not
i
say
it
is
better
to
make
no
profession
better
than
what
what
is
the
alternative
o
you
know
now
you
are
catechizing
me
it
is
better
to
make
no
profession
than
to
make
it
and
not
live
up
to
it
i
understand
that
is
to
say
it
is
wicked
to
pay
your
debts
with
counterfeit
notes
so
it
is
better
not
to
pay
them
at
all
nonsense
basil
i
am
not
talking
of
paying
debts
but
i
am
what
have
debts
got
to
do
with
it
i
beg
your
pardon
i
understood
you
to
declare
your
disapprobation
of
false
money
and
your
preference
for
another
sort
of
dishonesty
dishonest
basil
there
is
no
dishonesty
by
what
name
do
you
call
it
he
was
speaking
gravely
though
with
a
surface
pleasantry
both
gravity
and
pleasantry
were
of
a
very
winning
kind
diana
looked
on
and
listened
much
interested
as
well
as
amused
gertrude
puzzled
and
impatient
though
unable
to
resist
the
attraction
she
hesitated
and
surveyed
him
there
ca
be
dishonesty
unless
where
one
owes
something
precisely
he
said
glancing
at
her
his
hands
were
busy
at
the
time
with
a
supple
twig
he
had
cut
from
one
of
the
trees
which
he
was
trimming
of
its
leaves
and
buds
what
do
i
owe
said
the
beauty
throwing
her
tresses
of
hair
off
from
her
shoulders
he
waited
a
bit
the
one
lady
looking
defiant
the
other
curious
and
then
he
said
with
a
sort
of
gentle
simplicity
that
was
at
the
same
time
uncompromising
lord
hath
made
all
things
for
himself
gertrude
foot
patted
the
turf
after
a
minute
she
answered
of
course
you
say
that
because
you
are
a
clergyman
no
i
do
i
am
stating
a
fact
which
i
thought
it
likely
you
had
forgotten
gertrude
stood
up
as
if
she
had
got
enough
of
the
conversation
diana
wished
for
another
word
it
is
a
fact
she
said
but
what
have
we
to
do
with
it
only
to
let
the
lord
have
his
own
said
the
minister
with
a
full
look
at
her
how
do
you
mean
masters
i
do
understand
gertrude
was
marching
over
the
grass
leading
to
the
house
the
other
two
followed
when
you
have
contrived
and
made
a
thing
you
reckon
it
is
your
own
do
you
and
when
you
have
bought
something
you
think
it
is
at
your
disposal
certainly
but
were
bought
with
a
price
of
course
god
has
a
right
to
dispose
of
us
diana
assented
in
an
of
course
way
he
said
the
minister
then
seeing
her
puzzled
expression
he
went
on
he
can
not
dispose
of
you
as
he
wishes
without
your
consent
diana
stopped
short
midway
in
the
meadow
i
do
not
in
the
least
understand
masters
she
said
how
does
he
wish
to
dispose
of
me
when
you
are
his
own
he
will
let
you
know
said
the
minister
beginning
to
stroll
onward
again
and
no
more
words
passed
till
they
were
nearing
the
house
when
he
said
suddenly
whom
do
you
think
you
belong
to
now
diana
thought
made
an
instant
leap
at
the
words
a
leap
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
intervening
space
and
alighted
beside
a
fine
figure
in
a
dark
blue
military
coat
with
straps
on
the
shoulders
that
was
where
she
belonged
she
thought
and
a
soft
rose
colour
mantled
on
her
cheek
and
deepened
half
with
happiness
halt
with
pride
the
question
that
had
provoked
it
was
forgotten
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
house
was
now
too
near
to
allow
of
the
inquiry
being
pressed
or
repeated
the
minister
indeed
was
aware
that
for
some
time
he
and
his
companion
had
been
facing
a
battery
but
diana
was
in
happy
unconsciousness
it
was
the
thought
of
nothing
present
or
near
which
made
her
eyes
droop
and
her
cheeks
take
on
such
a
bloom
of
loveliness
among
the
eyes
that
beheld
starling
had
not
been
the
least
keen
though
she
watched
without
seeming
to
watch
she
saw
how
the
minister
and
her
daughter
came
slowly
over
the
meadow
engaged
with
each
other
conversation
while
miss
masters
tripped
on
before
them
she
noticed
the
pause
in
their
walk
diana
slow
thoughtful
step
and
then
as
they
came
near
her
flush
and
her
downcast
eye
the
minister
talk
very
interestin
whispered
carpenter
in
her
ear
not
to
me
said
starling
wilfully
misunderstanding
some
folks
thinks
so
i
know
i
ca
somehow
never
get
along
with
him
and
diana
was
her
inward
resolve
but
she
ca
be
of
the
other
feller
as
if
to
try
the
question
at
the
moment
reverdy
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
steps
just
as
the
minister
and
diana
got
to
the
foot
of
them
she
was
in
high
glee
for
her
party
was
going
off
nicely
and
the
tables
were
just
preparing
for
supper
we
want
nothing
now
but
evan
she
said
with
her
unfailing
laugh
miss
starling
do
you
think
he
might
have
come
for
this
afternoon
just
to
see
so
many
friends
diana
never
knew
where
she
got
the
coolness
to
answer
how
long
a
journey
is
it
mrs
reverdy
o
i
do
know
how
far
is
it
mr
masters
a
thousand
miles
or
two
thousand
i
declare
i
have
no
idea
but
love
laughs
at
distances
they
say
is
cupid
a
contractor
on
this
road
inquired
the
minister
gravely
a
contractor
exclaimed
reverdy
laughing
oh
dear
what
a
funny
idea
i
never
thought
of
putting
it
so
but
i
did
know
but
miss
starling
could
tell
us
do
you
know
anything
about
it
miss
diana
asked
the
minister
about
what
why
lieutenant
knowlton
is
not
here
this
afternoon
diana
knew
that
several
pairs
of
eyes
were
upon
her
it
was
a
dangerous
minute
but
she
had
failed
to
discern
in
reverdy
or
in
gertrude
any
symptom
of
more
than
curiosity
and
curiosity
she
felt
she
could
meet
and
baffle
it
was
impertinent
and
it
was
unkind
so
though
her
mind
was
at
a
point
which
made
it
close
steering
she
managed
to
sheer
off
from
embarrassment
and
look
amused
she
laughed
in
the
eyes
that
were
watching
her
and
answered
carelessly
enough
to
question
that
she
dared
say
knowlton
would
have
come
if
he
could
starling
put
up
her
work
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
the
rest
of
the
persons
concerned
felt
free
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
their
minds
and
pay
attention
to
the
supper
it
was
a
great
success
reverdy
sewing
party
the
excellent
entertainment
provided
was
heartily
enjoyed
all
the
more
for
the
little
stimulus
of
curiosity
which
hung
about
every
article
and
each
detail
of
the
old
bowdoin
delighted
himself
in
hospitable
attentions
to
his
old
neighbours
and
was
full
of
genial
and
gratified
talk
with
them
the
stiffness
of
the
afternoon
departed
before
the
tea
and
coffee
and
when
at
last
the
assembly
broke
up
and
a
little
file
of
country
waggons
drove
away
one
after
another
from
the
door
it
was
with
highly
gratified
loads
of
people
diana
may
be
quoted
as
a
single
exception
in
the
tremor
of
her
spirits
which
followed
the
bit
of
social
navigation
noticed
above
she
had
hardly
known
how
anything
tasted
at
the
supper
and
the
talk
she
had
heard
without
hearing
there
was
nothing
but
relief
in
getting
away
the
drive
home
was
as
silent
between
her
and
her
mother
as
the
drive
out
had
been
starling
was
full
of
her
own
cogitations
thoughts
were
not
like
that
and
lines
of
argument
growing
harder
and
more
twisted
towards
their
end
but
wide
flowing
and
soft
changing
visions
flowing
sweet
and
free
as
the
clouds
borne
on
the
of
heaven
catching
such
colours
and
drifting
as
insensibly
from
one
form
into
another
the
evening
kept
up
the
dreamy
character
of
the
afternoon
the
haze
growing
duskier
as
the
light
waned
till
the
tender
gleam
of
a
full
moon
began
to
supply
here
and
there
the
glory
of
the
lost
sunlight
it
was
a
colder
gleam
though
and
so
far
more
practical
than
that
flush
of
living
promise
which
a
little
while
ago
had
filled
the
sky
and
the
world
thoughts
centred
on
evan
letter
where
was
it
when
should
she
get
it
josiah
she
knew
had
been
to
the
post
office
that
morning
and
brought
home
nothing
she
wished
she
could
go
to
the
post
office
herself
she
sometimes
had
done
so
but
she
would
not
like
to
take
evan
letter
either
from
the
knowing
hands
of
the
postmaster
she
might
not
be
able
to
command
her
looks
perfectly
they
do
know
how
to
make
soda
biscuit
down
yonder
starling
broke
out
abruptly
just
as
their
drive
was
near
ended
do
they
said
diana
absently
all
yellow
said
starling
disdainfully
nobody
would
ever
know
there
was
any
salaratus
in
biscuit
or
in
yours
either
except
from
the
lightness
mother
the
lightness
would
tell
what
made
light
said
starling
logically
they
had
salaratus
in
their
pickles
too
how
could
you
tell
tell
as
if
i
could
tell
tell
by
the
colour
ours
are
green
too
not
green
like
that
i
would
despise
to
make
my
pickles
green
that
way
i
as
soon
paint
it
was
very
handsome
mother
the
supper
altogether
hm
it
was
a
little
too
handsome
said
starling
and
that
was
what
they
liked
about
it
i
like
to
know
what
is
the
use
o
having
great
clumsy
forks
of
silver
o
they
were
real
mother
well
the
more
fools
if
they
were
i
like
to
know
what
is
the
use
of
having
great
clumsy
forks
of
silver
real
or
when
you
can
have
nice
sharp
handy
steel
ones
and
for
half
or
a
quarter
the
price
diana
liked
the
silver
forks
and
was
silent
i
could
hardly
eat
my
pickles
with
i
could
if
they
had
been
but
genevieve
cucumbers
were
spongy
to
diana
relief
their
own
door
was
gained
at
this
moment
she
did
not
know
what
her
mother
discourse
might
end
in
and
was
glad
to
have
it
stopped
yet
the
drive
had
been
pretty
the
men
had
had
their
supper
which
had
been
left
ready
for
them
and
josiah
care
had
kept
up
a
blazing
fire
in
the
kitchen
diana
went
to
change
her
dress
for
she
had
the
dishes
now
to
wash
up
and
starling
stood
in
front
of
the
pondering
she
had
been
pondering
all
the
time
of
the
drive
home
as
well
as
much
of
the
time
spent
at
elmfield
she
believed
she
had
come
to
a
conclusion
and
yet
she
delayed
her
purpose
it
was
clear
she
said
to
herself
that
diana
did
not
care
for
lieut
knowlton
at
least
not
much
her
fancy
might
have
been
stirred
but
what
is
a
girl
fancy
nothing
worth
considering
letters
if
allowed
might
nourish
the
fancy
up
into
something
else
she
would
destroy
this
first
one
she
had
determined
on
that
yet
she
lingered
conscience
spoke
uneasily
what
if
she
were
misled
by
appearances
and
diana
had
more
than
a
fancy
for
this
young
fellow
then
she
would
crush
it
nobody
would
be
the
wiser
and
nobody
would
die
of
grief
those
things
were
done
in
stories
only
starling
hesitated
nevertheless
with
her
hand
on
the
letter
till
the
sound
of
diana
step
in
the
house
decided
her
action
she
was
afraid
to
wait
some
accident
might
overthrow
all
her
arrangements
and
with
a
hasty
movement
she
drew
the
packet
from
her
bosom
and
tucked
it
under
the
fofestick
where
a
bed
of
glowing
nutwood
coals
lay
ready
quick
the
fire
caught
the
light
tindery
edges
made
a
little
jet
of
excitement
about
the
large
wax
seal
fought
its
way
through
the
thick
folds
of
paper
and
in
a
moment
had
left
only
a
mock
sheet
of
cinder
with
mock
marks
of
writing
still
traceable
vividly
upon
it
a
letter
still
manifestly
and
square
it
glowed
at
starling
from
its
bed
of
coals
with
the
curious
impassiveness
of
material
things
as
if
the
happiness
of
two
lives
had
not
shrivelled
within
it
starling
stood
looking
what
had
been
written
upon
that
fiery
scroll
it
was
vain
to
ask
now
and
hearing
diana
coming
she
took
the
tongs
and
punched
the
square
cinder
that
kept
its
form
too
well
little
bits
of
paper
grey
cinder
with
red
edges
fluttered
in
the
draught
and
flew
up
in
the
smoke
what
are
you
burning
there
mother
said
diana
and
starling
answered
a
guilty
nothing
and
walked
away
diana
looked
at
the
little
fluttering
cinders
and
an
uneasy
sensation
came
over
her
that
yet
took
no
form
of
suspicion
and
passed
for
the
thing
was
impossible
so
near
she
came
to
it
why
had
starling
not
at
least
read
the
letter
before
destroying
it
the
answer
lies
in
some
of
the
strange
hidden
involutions
of
feeling
and
consciousness
which
are
hard
to
trace
out
even
by
the
person
who
knows
them
best
after
the
thing
was
done
she
wished
she
had
read
it
it
may
be
she
feared
to
find
what
would
stay
her
hand
or
make
her
action
difficult
it
may
be
that
certain
stirrings
of
conscience
warned
her
that
delay
might
defeat
her
whole
purpose
she
was
an
obstinate
woman
by
nature
obstinate
to
the
point
of
wilful
blindness
when
necessary
and
to
do
her
justice
she
was
perfectly
incapable
of
estimating
the
gain
or
the
loss
of
such
an
affection
as
diana
or
of
sympathizing
with
the
suffering
such
a
nature
may
know
it
was
not
in
her
she
had
no
key
to
it
grant
the
utmost
mischief
that
she
supposed
it
even
possible
she
might
be
doing
and
it
was
as
a
summer
gale
to
the
cyclone
of
the
indian
seas
so
her
conscience
troubled
her
little
and
that
little
was
soon
silenced
perhaps
not
quite
forgotten
for
it
had
the
effect
not
to
make
her
more
than
usual
tender
of
her
daughter
and
indulgent
towards
her
as
one
would
expect
but
stern
carping
and
exacting
beyond
all
her
wont
she
drove
household
matters
with
a
tighter
rein
than
ever
and
gave
diana
as
little
time
for
private
thought
or
musing
as
the
constant
and
engrossing
occupation
of
her
hands
could
leave
free
but
however
thoughts
are
not
chained
to
fingers
alas
what
troubled
calculations
diana
worked
into
her
butter
those
weeks
and
how
many
heavy
possibilities
she
shook
down
from
her
fingers
along
with
the
drops
of
water
she
scattered
upon
the
clothes
for
the
ironing
her
very
nights
at
last
became
filled
with
the
anxious
cogitations
that
never
ceased
all
the
day
and
diana
awoke
morning
after
morning
unrefreshed
and
weary
from
her
burdened
sleep
and
from
dreams
that
reproduced
in
fantastic
combinations
the
perplexities
of
her
waking
life
her
face
began
to
grow
shadowed
and
anxious
and
her
tongue
was
still
starling
had
generally
done
most
of
the
talking
she
did
it
all
now
days
passed
on
and
weeks
starling
did
not
find
out
that
anything
was
the
matter
with
diana
partly
because
she
was
determined
that
nothing
should
be
the
matter
and
partly
because
young
flandin
came
about
the
house
a
good
deal
and
starling
thought
diana
to
be
vexed
or
perhaps
in
a
state
of
vexed
indecision
about
him
and
in
addition
she
was
a
little
anxious
herself
lest
another
letter
should
come
and
somehow
reach
the
hands
it
was
meant
for
having
gone
so
far
already
starling
did
not
mean
to
spoil
or
lose
her
work
for
want
of
a
few
finishing
touches
she
watched
the
post
office
as
never
in
her
life
for
any
cause
she
had
watched
it
before
chapter
xvi
is
it
well
with
thee
diana
would
have
written
to
knowlton
to
get
her
mystery
solved
she
was
far
too
simple
and
true
to
stand
upon
needless
punctilio
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
address
to
him
a
letter
evan
himself
had
not
known
when
he
parted
from
her
the
information
came
in
that
epistle
that
never
reached
her
hands
that
first
letter
names
and
directions
had
all
perished
in
the
flames
and
for
want
of
them
diana
could
do
nothing
meanwhile
what
would
evan
think
he
would
expect
an
answer
and
a
quick
answer
to
his
letter
he
was
looking
for
it
now
no
doubt
wondering
why
it
did
not
come
and
disappointed
and
fearing
something
wrong
that
trouble
of
fearing
something
wrong
diana
was
spared
for
she
knew
the
family
at
elmfield
had
heard
and
all
was
well
but
sometimes
her
other
troublesome
thoughts
made
her
powerless
hands
come
together
with
a
clasp
of
wild
pain
how
long
must
she
wait
now
how
long
would
evan
wait
before
in
desperation
he
wrote
again
and
where
was
her
letter
for
it
had
been
written
and
sent
that
she
knew
was
it
lost
was
it
stolen
had
somebody
curiosity
prevailed
so
far
and
was
her
precious
secret
town
property
by
this
time
every
day
became
harder
to
bear
every
week
made
the
suspense
more
intolerable
starling
was
far
out
in
one
of
her
suppositions
will
flandin
came
a
good
deal
about
the
house
it
is
true
but
diana
hardly
knew
he
was
there
if
she
thought
about
it
at
all
she
was
half
glad
because
his
presence
might
serve
to
mask
her
silence
and
abstraction
she
was
conscious
of
both
and
the
effort
to
cover
the
one
and
hide
the
other
was
very
painful
sometimes
october
glories
were
passed
away
and
november
days
grew
shorter
and
shorter
colder
and
more
dreary
it
seemed
now
and
then
to
diana
that
summer
had
gone
to
a
distance
from
which
it
would
never
revisit
her
and
after
those
days
of
constant
communication
with
evan
the
blank
cessation
of
it
the
ignorance
of
all
that
had
befallen
or
was
befalling
him
the
want
of
a
word
of
remembrance
or
affection
grew
almost
to
a
blank
of
despair
it
was
late
in
the
month
what
waggon
that
stopping
exclaimed
starling
one
afternoon
mother
and
daughter
were
in
the
diana
looked
out
and
saw
with
a
pang
of
various
feelings
what
waggon
it
was
ai
that
the
elmfield
folks
i
think
so
i
know
so
i
thought
reverdy
and
the
rest
had
run
away
from
the
cold
did
you
know
miss
masters
had
been
sick
how
should
i
know
it
i
heard
so
i
did
know
but
you
had
heard
it
i
ca
hear
things
without
somebody
tells
me
go
along
diana
and
put
on
something
diana
obeyed
but
she
was
very
quick
about
it
she
was
nervously
afraid
lest
while
she
was
absent
some
word
should
be
said
that
she
would
not
have
lost
for
the
whole
world
what
had
they
come
for
these
people
was
the
secret
out
perhaps
and
had
they
come
to
bring
her
a
letter
or
to
say
why
evan
had
not
written
could
he
have
been
sick
a
feverish
whirlwind
of
thoughts
rushed
through
diana
head
while
she
was
fastening
her
dress
and
she
went
down
and
came
into
the
parlour
with
two
beautiful
spots
of
rose
colour
upon
her
cheeks
they
were
diana
had
been
pale
of
late
but
she
looked
gloriously
handsome
as
she
entered
the
room
bad
for
her
a
woman
might
have
heard
news
from
evan
the
instant
resolve
in
the
hearts
of
the
two
ladies
who
had
come
to
visit
her
was
that
this
girl
should
hear
none
they
were
however
exceedingly
gracious
and
agreeable
reverdy
entered
with
flattering
interest
into
all
the
matters
of
household
and
farm
detail
respecting
which
starling
chose
to
be
communicative
responded
with
details
of
her
own
how
it
was
impossible
to
get
good
butter
made
unless
you
made
it
yourself
how
servants
were
unsatisfactory
even
in
pleasant
valley
and
how
delightful
it
was
to
be
able
to
do
without
them
as
starling
did
and
diana
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
said
reverdy
with
her
unfailing
laugh
a
little
low
murmur
of
a
laugh
it
must
be
so
delightful
to
have
your
biscuits
always
light
and
never
tasting
of
soda
and
your
butter
always
as
if
it
was
made
of
cowslips
and
your
eggs
always
fresh
we
never
have
fresh
eggs
continued
reverdy
shaking
her
head
solemnly
never
i
never
dare
to
have
them
boiled
what
becomes
of
them
said
a
new
voice
and
masters
entered
the
field
in
other
words
the
room
diana
heart
contracted
with
a
pang
was
this
another
hindrance
in
the
way
of
her
hearing
what
she
wanted
but
the
rest
of
the
ladies
welcomed
him
charming
said
reverdy
now
you
will
go
home
with
us
i
do
see
just
on
what
you
found
your
conclusion
o
you
will
have
made
your
visit
to
starling
you
know
and
then
you
will
have
nothing
else
to
do
there
spoke
a
woman
of
business
said
the
minister
yes
why
not
said
the
lady
i
was
just
telling
starling
how
i
should
delight
to
do
as
she
does
without
servants
and
how
pleasant
i
should
find
it
only
you
know
i
should
know
how
to
do
anything
if
i
tried
reverdy
seemed
to
find
the
idea
very
entertaining
you
would
like
to
get
up
in
the
morning
to
make
your
biscuits
said
gertrude
o
yes
i
would
i
need
have
breakfast
very
early
you
know
the
good
butter
would
be
on
the
table
if
you
did
said
starling
would
it
why
does
it
matter
when
butter
is
made
if
it
is
only
made
right
no
but
the
trouble
is
it
can
not
be
made
right
after
the
sun
is
an
hour
or
two
high
an
hour
or
two
reverdy
uttered
a
little
scream
not
at
this
time
of
year
mother
interposed
diana
do
you
get
up
at
these
fearful
times
inquired
miss
masters
languidly
turning
her
eyes
full
upon
the
latter
speaker
diana
scarce
answered
would
all
the
minutes
of
their
visit
pass
in
these
platitudes
could
nothing
else
be
talked
of
the
next
instant
she
blessed
masters
have
you
heard
from
the
soldier
lately
he
asked
o
yes
we
hear
frequently
reverdy
said
he
likes
his
post
i
really
do
know
said
her
sister
laughing
a
soldier
choose
you
know
i
fancy
they
have
some
rough
times
out
there
but
they
manage
to
get
a
good
deal
of
fun
too
evan
last
letter
told
of
buffalo
hunting
and
said
they
had
some
very
good
society
too
you
would
expect
it
on
the
outskirts
of
everything
but
the
families
are
very
pleasant
there
are
young
ladies
sometimes
and
every
one
is
made
a
great
deal
of
where
is
mr
knowlton
diana
asked
she
had
been
working
up
her
courage
to
dare
the
question
it
was
hazardous
she
was
afraid
to
trust
her
voice
but
the
daring
of
desperation
was
on
her
and
the
words
came
out
with
sufficiently
cool
utterance
a
keen
observer
might
note
a
change
in
reverdy
look
and
tone
o
he
in
one
of
those
dreadful
posts
out
on
the
frontier
too
near
the
indians
but
i
suppose
if
there
were
indians
there
would
be
forts
and
they
would
want
officers
or
soldiers
to
be
in
them
she
added
looking
at
masters
as
if
she
had
found
a
happy
final
cause
for
the
existence
of
the
aborigines
of
the
country
what
is
the
name
of
the
place
diana
asked
i
declare
i
forgotten
fort
i
ca
think
of
any
name
but
vancouver
and
it
is
that
gertrude
what
the
name
of
that
place
do
you
know
i
ca
tell
whether
it
is
in
arizona
or
wisconsin
and
reverdy
laughed
at
her
geographical
innocence
gertrude
did
remember
he
is
not
so
far
off
as
vancouver
i
think
said
masters
no
o
no
not
so
far
as
that
but
he
might
just
as
well
when
you
get
to
a
certain
distance
it
do
signify
whether
it
is
more
or
less
you
ca
get
at
people
and
they
ca
get
at
you
have
seemed
to
be
at
that
distance
lately
basil
what
a
dreadful
name
how
came
you
to
be
called
such
a
name
be
thankful
it
is
no
worse
said
the
minister
gravely
i
might
have
been
called
lactantius
lactantius
impossible
was
there
ever
a
man
named
lactantius
certainly
any
worse
than
ichabod
remarked
starling
nothing
can
be
worse
than
ichabod
said
masters
in
the
same
dry
way
it
means
glory
is
departed
the
ichabods
i
knew
never
had
any
glory
to
begin
with
said
starling
but
the
minister
laughed
at
this
and
so
gaily
that
it
was
infectious
starling
joined
in
without
well
knowing
why
the
lady
visitors
seemed
to
be
very
much
amused
diana
tried
to
laugh
with
lips
that
felt
rigid
as
steel
the
minister
eye
came
to
hers
too
she
knew
to
see
how
the
fun
went
with
her
and
then
the
ladies
rose
took
a
very
flattering
leave
and
departed
carrying
masters
off
with
them
i
am
coming
to
look
at
those
books
of
yours
soon
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
with
diana
may
i
diana
made
her
answer
as
civil
as
she
could
with
those
stiff
lips
how
she
bade
to
the
others
she
never
knew
as
her
mother
attended
them
to
the
garden
gate
she
went
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
feeling
now
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
pain
not
be
seeing
these
people
had
brought
evan
so
near
and
hearing
them
talk
had
put
him
at
such
an
impossible
distance
diana
pressed
both
hands
on
her
heart
and
stood
looking
out
of
her
window
at
the
departing
carriage
what
could
she
do
nothing
that
she
could
think
of
and
to
do
nothing
was
the
intolerable
part
of
it
any
the
most
tedious
and
lingering
action
yes
even
the
least
hopeful
anything
that
would
have
been
action
would
have
made
the
pain
supportable
she
could
have
drawn
breath
then
enough
for
life
purposes
now
she
was
stifling
there
was
some
mystery
there
was
something
wrong
some
mistake
or
misapprehension
or
malpractice
which
if
she
could
put
her
hand
on
all
would
be
right
and
it
was
hidden
from
her
dark
it
might
be
near
or
far
she
could
not
touch
it
for
she
could
not
find
it
there
was
even
no
place
for
suspicion
to
take
hold
unless
the
curiosity
of
the
post
office
or
of
some
prying
neighbour
she
did
not
suspect
evan
and
yet
there
was
a
great
throb
at
her
heart
with
the
thought
that
in
evan
place
would
never
have
let
things
rest
nothing
should
have
kept
the
silence
so
long
unbroken
if
the
first
letter
got
no
answer
she
would
have
written
another
so
would
diana
have
done
now
without
being
in
evan
place
if
only
she
had
had
his
address
and
that
cruel
woman
did
she
know
or
did
she
guess
anything
or
was
it
another
of
the
untoward
circumstances
attending
the
whole
matter
it
came
to
her
now
a
thought
of
regret
that
she
had
not
ventured
the
disagreeableness
and
told
her
mother
long
ago
of
her
interest
in
evan
starling
could
take
measures
that
her
daughter
could
not
take
if
she
pleased
that
is
and
the
doubt
also
recurred
whether
she
would
please
it
was
by
no
means
certain
and
at
any
rate
now
in
her
mortification
and
pain
diana
could
not
invite
her
mother
into
her
counsels
she
felt
that
as
from
her
window
she
watched
the
receding
waggon
and
saw
starling
turn
from
the
gate
and
walk
in
uncompromising
unsympathizing
even
her
gait
and
the
set
of
her
head
and
shoulders
proclaimed
her
to
be
diana
was
alone
with
her
trouble
an
hour
afterwards
she
came
down
as
usual
strained
the
milk
skimmed
her
cream
went
through
the
whole
little
routine
of
the
household
evening
her
hands
were
steady
her
eye
was
true
her
memory
lost
nothing
but
she
did
not
speak
one
word
unless
which
was
seldom
a
word
was
spoken
to
her
so
went
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
november
days
were
trailing
along
december
would
follow
there
was
no
change
from
one
to
another
no
variety
less
than
ever
before
for
with
morbid
sensitiveness
diana
shrank
from
visitors
and
visiting
every
contact
gave
her
pain
meanwhile
where
was
evan
second
letter
on
its
way
and
in
the
post
office
it
was
late
in
november
diana
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
the
where
she
had
been
sitting
on
that
june
day
when
our
story
began
she
was
alone
this
time
and
her
look
and
attitude
were
sadly
at
variance
with
that
former
time
the
november
day
was
not
without
a
charm
of
its
own
which
might
even
challenge
comparison
with
the
june
glory
for
it
was
indian
summer
time
and
the
wonder
of
soft
spiritual
beauty
which
had
settled
down
upon
the
landscape
brown
and
bare
though
that
was
left
no
room
to
regret
the
full
verdure
and
radiant
sunlight
of
high
summer
the
indescribable
loveliness
of
the
haze
and
hush
the
winning
tender
colouring
that
was
through
the
air
and
wrapped
round
everything
softening
mellowing
harmonizing
somehow
even
the
most
unsightly
hiding
where
it
could
not
beautify
and
beautifying
where
it
could
not
hide
like
christian
charity
gave
a
most
exquisite
lesson
to
the
world
of
how
much
more
mighty
is
spirit
than
matter
diana
did
not
see
it
as
she
had
seen
the
june
day
her
arms
were
folded
lying
one
upon
another
in
idle
fashion
her
face
was
grave
and
fixed
the
eyes
aimless
and
visionless
looking
at
nothing
and
seeing
nothing
cheeks
pale
and
the
mouth
parted
with
pain
and
questioning
its
delicious
childlike
curves
just
now
all
gone
so
sitting
and
so
abstracted
in
her
own
thoughts
she
never
knew
that
anybody
was
near
till
the
little
gate
opened
and
then
with
a
start
she
saw
masters
coming
up
the
walk
diana
rose
and
stood
in
the
doorway
all
traces
of
manners
if
she
had
ever
had
any
had
disappeared
before
the
dignity
of
a
great
and
engrossing
trouble
good
evening
she
said
quietly
as
they
shook
hands
mother
gone
out
gone
out
is
she
said
masters
but
not
with
a
tone
of
particular
disappointment
yes
i
believe
she
has
gone
to
the
corner
to
the
post
office
the
corner
is
a
good
way
off
and
how
do
you
do
diana
thought
he
looked
at
her
a
little
meaningly
she
answered
in
the
customary
form
that
she
was
well
that
says
a
great
deal
or
nothing
at
all
the
minister
remarked
what
said
diana
not
comprehending
him
that
form
of
words
am
well
it
is
very
apt
to
mean
nothing
at
all
said
diana
for
people
say
it
without
thinking
as
you
did
just
now
perhaps
but
i
well
altogether
said
the
minister
soul
and
mind
and
body
the
word
read
dry
enough
his
manner
his
tone
half
gentle
half
bold
with
a
curious
inoffensive
kind
of
boldness
took
from
them
their
dryness
and
gave
them
a
certain
sweet
acceptableness
that
most
persons
knew
who
knew
masters
diana
never
dreamed
that
he
was
intrusive
even
though
she
recognised
the
fact
that
he
was
about
his
work
nevertheless
she
waived
the
question
can
anybody
say
that
he
is
well
she
asked
i
hope
he
can
do
you
know
the
old
lady
who
is
called
mother
bartlett
o
yes
do
you
think
she
would
hesitate
about
answering
that
question
or
be
mistaken
in
the
answer
but
what
do
you
mean
by
it
exactly
said
diana
do
you
know
i
suppose
i
do
i
know
what
it
means
to
be
well
in
body
i
have
been
well
all
my
life
how
would
you
characterize
that
happy
condition
why
said
diana
unused
to
definitions
of
abstractions
but
following
masters
lead
as
people
always
did
gentle
or
simple
i
mean
or
it
means
sound
and
comfortable
and
fit
for
what
one
has
to
do
excellent
said
the
minister
i
see
you
understand
the
subject
can
not
those
things
be
true
of
soul
and
mind
as
well
as
of
body
what
is
the
difference
between
soul
and
mind
said
diana
a
clear
departure
said
the
minister
laughing
then
gravely
do
you
read
philosophy
i
do
know
said
diana
i
read
or
i
used
to
read
a
good
many
sorts
of
books
i
have
read
much
lately
the
minister
gave
her
another
keen
look
while
she
was
attending
to
something
else
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
with
a
change
of
tone
i
had
a
promise
once
that
i
should
see
those
books
any
time
said
diana
eagerly
any
time
for
it
would
be
an
easy
way
of
entertaining
him
or
of
getting
rid
of
him
either
would
do
i
think
i
proposed
a
plan
of
exchange
which
might
be
to
the
advantage
of
us
both
to
mine
i
am
sure
said
diana
i
do
know
whether
there
can
be
anything
you
would
care
for
among
the
books
but
if
there
should
be
would
you
like
to
go
up
and
look
at
them
i
should
if
it
would
not
give
you
too
much
trouble
it
would
be
no
trouble
just
to
run
and
show
him
where
they
were
and
this
diana
did
leaving
him
to
overhaul
the
stock
at
his
leisure
she
came
down
and
went
on
with
her
work
diana
heart
was
too
sound
and
her
head
too
clear
to
allow
her
to
be
more
than
to
a
certain
degree
distressed
at
not
hearing
from
evan
she
did
not
doubt
him
more
than
she
doubted
herself
and
not
doubting
him
things
must
come
out
all
right
by
and
by
she
was
restive
under
the
present
pain
at
times
wild
with
the
desire
to
find
and
remove
the
something
whatever
it
was
which
had
come
between
evan
and
her
for
this
girl
was
no
calm
nature
but
one
with
depths
of
passionate
reserve
and
terrible
possibilities
of
suffering
or
enjoying
she
had
been
calm
all
her
life
until
now
because
these
powers
and
susceptibilities
had
been
in
an
absolute
poise
an
equilibrium
that
nothing
had
shaken
now
the
depths
were
stirred
and
at
times
she
was
in
a
storm
of
impatient
pain
but
there
came
revulsions
of
hope
and
quiet
lulls
when
the
sun
almost
shone
again
under
the
clearance
made
by
faith
and
hope
one
of
these
revulsions
came
now
after
she
had
set
the
minister
to
work
upon
her
books
perhaps
it
was
simple
reaction
perhaps
it
was
something
caught
from
the
quiet
sunshiny
manner
and
spirit
of
her
visitor
but
at
her
work
in
the
kitchen
diana
grew
quite
she
fancied
she
had
discerned
somewhat
of
more
than
usual
earnestness
in
the
minister
observation
of
her
and
she
began
to
question
whether
her
looks
or
behaviour
had
furnished
occasion
perhaps
she
had
not
been
ready
enough
to
talk
poor
diana
knew
it
was
often
the
case
now
she
resolved
she
would
try
to
mend
that
when
he
came
down
and
there
was
besides
a
certain
lurking
impatience
of
the
bearing
of
his
words
they
had
probed
a
little
too
deep
and
after
the
manner
of
some
morbid
conditions
the
probing
irritated
her
so
by
and
by
when
masters
came
down
with
a
brown
volume
in
his
hand
and
offered
to
borrow
it
if
she
would
let
him
lend
her
another
of
different
colour
diana
met
him
and
answered
quite
like
herself
and
went
on
masters
how
can
people
be
always
well
in
body
mind
and
spirit
as
you
say
i
am
sure
people
bodies
get
sick
without
any
fault
of
their
own
and
there
are
accidents
and
just
so
there
are
troubles
people
ca
help
troubles
and
they
ca
be
in
mind
i
suppose
when
they
are
in
pain
are
you
sure
of
that
the
minister
answered
quietly
while
he
turned
to
the
window
to
look
at
something
in
the
volume
he
had
brought
down
with
him
why
yes
and
so
are
you
masters
are
you
not
you
need
to
know
a
great
deal
to
be
sure
of
anything
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
but
you
are
certain
of
this
mr
masters
i
should
like
to
expose
myself
to
your
criticism
let
us
look
at
facts
it
seems
to
me
that
david
was
when
he
could
say
hast
delivered
my
soul
from
death
mine
eyes
from
tears
and
my
feet
from
falling
also
the
man
described
in
another
place
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
there
came
a
slight
quiver
across
diana
face
but
her
words
were
moved
by
another
feeling
those
were
people
of
the
old
times
i
do
know
anything
about
them
i
mean
people
of
i
think
paul
was
when
he
could
say
have
learned
in
whatsoever
state
i
am
therewith
to
be
content
o
but
that
is
nonsense
mr
masters
it
was
paul
experience
yes
but
it
can
not
be
the
experience
of
other
people
paul
was
inspired
to
write
what
was
true
not
what
was
false
said
the
minister
looking
at
her
you
do
think
peace
and
content
come
by
inspiration
do
you
i
did
not
think
about
it
said
diana
but
i
am
sure
it
is
impossible
to
be
as
he
said
i
never
heard
paul
truth
questioned
before
said
the
minister
with
a
dry
sort
of
comicality
no
but
masters
said
diana
half
by
way
of
apology
i
spoke
from
my
own
experience
and
he
spoke
from
his
but
sir
masters
seriously
do
you
think
it
is
possible
to
be
contented
when
one
is
in
trouble
miss
diana
one
greater
than
david
or
paul
said
this
a
man
love
me
he
will
keep
my
words
and
my
father
will
love
him
and
we
will
come
unto
him
and
make
our
abode
with
him
where
there
is
that
indwelling
believe
me
there
is
no
trouble
that
can
overthrow
content
content
and
pain
together
said
diana
sometimes
pain
and
very
great
joy
you
are
speaking
of
what
i
do
not
understand
in
the
least
said
diana
and
her
face
looked
half
incredulous
half
sad
i
wish
you
did
know
it
he
said
no
more
only
those
few
words
had
a
simplicity
a
truth
an
accent
of
sympathy
and
affection
that
reached
the
very
depth
of
the
heart
he
was
speaking
to
as
the
same
things
from
his
lips
had
often
reached
other
hearts
he
promised
to
take
care
of
the
book
in
his
hand
and
presently
went
away
with
one
of
the
warm
frank
lingering
grasps
of
the
hand
that
were
also
a
characteristic
of
basil
masters
diana
stood
at
the
door
watching
him
ride
away
it
can
not
be
said
she
was
soothed
by
his
words
and
perhaps
he
did
not
mean
she
should
be
she
stood
with
a
weary
feeling
of
want
in
her
heart
but
she
thought
only
of
the
want
of
evan
chapter
xvii
the
use
of
living
it
was
quite
according
to
diana
nature
that
as
the
winter
went
on
though
still
without
news
of
evan
her
tumult
and
agony
of
mind
quieted
down
into
a
calm
and
steadfast
waiting
her
spirit
was
too
healthy
for
suspicion
too
true
for
doubt
and
put
away
doubt
and
suspicion
what
was
left
but
the
assurance
that
there
had
been
some
accident
or
mistake
from
the
consequences
of
which
she
was
suffering
no
doubt
but
which
would
all
be
made
right
and
come
out
clear
so
soon
as
there
could
be
an
opportunity
for
explanation
for
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
a
little
with
the
returning
mild
weather
evan
would
be
able
to
procure
a
furlough
he
would
be
at
her
side
and
then
nothing
then
but
union
and
joy
she
could
wait
and
even
in
the
waiting
her
healthy
spirit
as
it
were
sloughed
off
care
and
came
back
again
to
its
usual
placid
strong
bright
condition
so
the
winter
went
a
winter
which
was
ever
after
a
blank
in
remembrance
and
the
cold
weather
broke
up
into
the
frosts
and
thaws
that
love
and
in
such
a
march
day
it
was
the
word
came
to
starling
house
that
old
squire
bowdoin
was
dead
the
like
weather
never
failed
in
after
years
to
bring
back
to
diana
that
one
day
and
its
tidings
and
the
strange
shock
they
gave
her
was
kind
o
sudden
said
the
who
was
joe
bartlett
he
was
took
all
to
once
and
jes
dropped
like
a
ripe
chestnut
why
like
a
ripe
chestnut
said
starling
sharply
wall
i
had
to
say
suthin
and
that
come
first
the
scripter
doos
speak
of
a
shock
o
corn
in
his
season
do
it
mis
starling
what
the
likeness
between
a
shock
o
corn
and
a
chestnut
joe
i
ca
abide
to
hear
folks
talk
nonsense
who
at
elmfield
ai
nary
one
there
that
had
ought
to
be
there
nary
one
but
the
help
but
they

said
starling
lifting
up
her
head
for
the
answer
wall
i
ca

he
too
fur
and
i
guess
men
in
his
place
hai
their
and
his
folks
is
flourishy
kind
o
bodies
i
set
no
count
on
for
my
part
well
everybody
else
be
there
and
shame
if
they
ai
said
starling
how
your
mother
joe
wall
i
guess
ripe
said
joe
with
a
slow
intonation
loving
and
reverent
but
she
goin
to
hold
on
to
this
state
o
things
yet
awhile
good
day
diana
went
to
the
old
man
funeral
with
her
mother
in
a
sort
of
tremble
of
spirits
looking
forward
to
what
she
might
possibly
see
or
hear
but
no
one
was
there
no
one
in
whom
she
had
any
interest
none
of
bowdoin
grandchildren
could
make
it
convenient
to
come
to
his
funeral
the
large
gathering
of
friends
and
neighbours
and
distant
relations
were
but
an
unmeaning
crowd
to
diana
perceptions
what
difference
would
this
change
at
elmfield
make
in
her
own
prospects
would
reverdy
and
her
set
come
to
elmfield
as
usual
and
so
draw
evan
as
a
matter
of
course
they
might
not
perhaps
but
what
difference
could
it
be
to
diana
evan
would
come
at
all
events
and
under
any
circumstances
even
if
his
coming
let
the
secret
out
he
would
come
and
nothing
would
keep
him
from
it
the
necessity
of
seeing
her
would
be
above
all
other
except
military
necessities
diana
thought
she
wished
the
old
gentlemen
had
not
died
but
it
could
make
no
difference
as
soon
as
he
could
evan
would
be
there
she
returned
to
her
quiet
waiting
but
now
nature
began
to
be
noisy
about
her
it
seemed
that
everything
had
a
voice
spring
winds
said
he
is
coming
the
perfume
of
opening
buds
was
sweet
with
his
presence
the
very
gales
that
chased
the
clouds
to
her
fancy
chased
the
minutes
as
well
the
waking
up
of
the
household
and
farm
activities
said
that
now
diana
inner
life
would
come
back
to
its
wonted
course
and
arrangements
the
spring
winds
blew
themselves
out
spring
buds
opened
into
full
leafage
spring
activities
gradually
merged
into
the
steady
routine
of
summer
and
still
diana
saw
nothing
and
still
she
heard
nothing
of
evan
she
was
patient
now
by
force
of
will
doggedly
trusting
she
not
doubt
none
of
the
family
came
to
elmfield
so
there
was
no
news
by
the
way
that
could
reach
her
starling
watched
the
success
of
her
experiment
and
was
satisfied
will
began
to
come
about
the
house
more
and
more
it
was
near
the
end
of
summer
more
than
a
year
since
her
first
introduction
to
evan
that
diana
found
herself
again
one
day
at
mother
bartlett
cottage
she
always
made
visits
there
from
time
to
time
she
had
come
for
no
special
reason
but
a
restlessness
which
possessed
her
at
home
the
old
lady
was
in
her
usual
chimney
corner
knitting
as
a
year
ago
and
diana
having
prepared
the
repast
and
cleared
away
after
it
was
sitting
on
the
doorstep
at
the
open
door
whence
her
eye
went
out
to
the
hillside
pasture
and
followed
the
two
cows
which
were
slowly
moving
about
there
it
was
as
quiet
a
bit
of
nature
as
could
be
found
anywhere
and
diana
was
very
quiet
looking
at
it
but
bartlett
eye
was
upon
her
much
more
than
upon
her
work
which
indeed
could
go
on
quite
well
without
such
supervision
she
broke
silence
at
last
speaking
with
an
imperceptible
little
sigh
and
so
dear
the
minister
preached
his
sermon
about
the
fashions
last
sabbath
about
fashion
said
diana
he
had
promised
it
long
ago
and
what
did
he
say
dear
he
said
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
away
but
he
said
something
more
i
suppose
could
have
said
that
he
said
a
great
deal
more
replied
diana
it
was
a
very
curious
sermon
as
i
hai
heard
it
and
you
hev
perhaps
you
oblige
me
with
some
more
of
it
it
was
a
very
curious
sermon
diana
repeated
not
in
the
least
like
what
you
would
have
expected
there
was
much
about
fashion
in
it
and
yet
somehow
it
seemed
to
be
that
what
was
his
text
i
ca
tell
something
about
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
i
do
remember
how
the
words
went
i
know
i
guess
said
the
old
lady
was
in
james
war
it
something
like
this
sun
is
no
sooner
risen
with
a
burning
heat
yes
yes
that
was
it
but
it
withereth
the
grass
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
and
the
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
perisheth
that
was
it
assented
diana
so
he
preached
about
the
shortness
of
life
no
not
at
all
he
began
with
those
words
and
just
a
sentence
or
two
and
it
was
beautiful
too
mother
explaining
them
and
then
he
said
the
bible
had
much
in
it
directly
speaking
of
our
fashions
he
would
give
us
what
there
was
and
let
us
make
what
we
could
of
it
so
he
did
you
can
make
a
good
deal
of
it
if
you
try
said
bartlett
and
then
dear
then
he
went
off
you
never
think
where
to
the
last
chapter
of
proverbs
and
he
described
the
woman
described
there
and
he
made
her
out
so
beautiful
and
good
and
clever
and
wise
that
somehow
without
saying
a
word
about
fashion
he
made
us
feel
how
would
never
have
had
any
concern
about
it
how
she
was
above
it
and
five
times
more
beautiful
without
than
she
would
have
been
with
the
foolish
ways
of
people
but
he
did
say
that
you
only
felt
it
i
much
believe
there
are
any
such
women
mother
i
hope
and
believe
you
make
just
such
a
one
diana
i
said
the
girl
with
a
curious
intonation
then
subsiding
again
immediately
she
sat
as
she
had
sat
at
her
own
door
a
year
ago
with
arms
folded
gazing
out
upon
the
summery
hill
pasture
where
the
cows
were
leisurely
feeding
but
now
her
eyes
had
a
steady
hard
look
not
busy
with
the
sunshiny
turf
or
the
deep
blue
sky
against
which
the
line
of
the
hill
cut
so
soft
and
clear
the
vision
had
been
all
outward
and
that
was
his
sermon
said
the
old
lady
with
a
dash
of
disappointment
no
o
no
said
diana
rousing
herself
he
went
on
then
how
shall
i
tell
you
do
you
remember
a
verse
in
the
revelation
about
the
church
coming
down
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
ay
said
the
old
lady
with
a
gratified
change
of
voice
well
he
went
on
to
describe
that
adornment
i
ca
tell
you
how
he
did
it
i
ca
repeat
what
he
said
but
it
was
inner
adornment
you
know
glorious
within
i
remember
he
said
and
without
a
word
more
about
what
he
started
with
he
made
one
feel
that
there
is
no
real
adornment
but
that
kind
nor
any
other
worth
a
thought
i
heard
kate
boddington
telling
mother
as
we
came
out
of
church
that
she
felt
as
cheap
as
dirt
with
all
her
silk
dress
and
new
bonnet
and
carpenter
who
was
close
by
said
she
felt
there
was
a
bit
of
her
that
would
bear
looking
at
what
did
your
mother
say
nothing
she
did
understand
it
she
said
and
di
how
did
you
feel
i
do
think
i
felt
anything
mother
how
come
that
about
i
do
know
i
believe
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
fashion
of
this
world
never
passed
away
it
the
same
thing
year
in
and
year
out
what
ails
you
diana
her
old
friend
asked
after
a
pause
nothing
i
sort
o
tired
i
do
see
how
folks
stand
it
to
live
a
long
life
but
life
has
not
been
very
hard
to
you
honey
it
need
be
for
that
diana
answered
with
a
kind
of
choke
in
her
voice
perhaps
the
hardest
of
all
would
be
to
go
on
an
unvarying
and
to
know
it
would
always
be
so
all
one
life
what
makes
life
all
of
a
sudden
so
tiresome
to
you
di
something
i
have
got
i
suppose
said
the
girl
drearily
i
have
enough
to
eat
and
drink
you
ai
as
bright
as
you
used
to
be
a
year
ago
i
have
grown
older
and
have
got
more
experience
if
life
is
good
for
nothin
else
di
it
good
to
make
ready
for
what
comes
after
i
do
believe
that
doctrine
mother
said
diana
energetically
life
is
meant
to
be
life
and
not
getting
ready
to
live
meant
to
be
all
brown
and
sawdusty
here
that
people
may
have
it
more
fresh
and
pleasant
by
and
by
no
but
to
drive
them
out
o
this
pasture
maybe
if
the
cows
found
always
the
grass
long
in
the
meadow
when
do
you
think
they
go
up
the
hill
a
quick
restless
change
of
position
was
the
only
answer
to
this
an
answer
most
unlike
the
natural
calm
grace
of
diana
movements
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
wistfully
doubtfully
two
or
three
times
up
and
down
from
her
knitting
before
speaking
again
and
then
speaking
was
prevented
for
the
other
door
opened
and
the
minister
came
in
basil
was
always
welcome
whatever
house
or
company
he
entered
he
could
fall
in
with
any
mood
take
up
any
subject
sympathize
in
anybody
concerns
that
was
part
of
his
secret
of
power
but
that
was
not
all
there
was
about
him
an
of
happiness
so
to
speak
a
steadfastness
of
the
inner
nature
which
gave
a
sense
of
calm
to
others
almost
by
the
force
of
sympathy
and
the
strength
of
a
quiet
will
which
was
however
inflexible
all
that
was
restless
uncertain
and
unsatisfied
in
men
hearts
and
lives
found
something
in
him
to
which
they
clung
as
if
it
had
been
an
anchor
of
hope
and
so
his
popularity
had
a
very
wide
and
at
first
sight
very
perplexing
range
the
two
women
in
bartlett
cottage
were
glad
to
see
him
and
they
had
reason
perhaps
for
he
was
very
quick
he
discerned
that
the
social
atmosphere
had
been
somewhat
hazy
when
he
came
in
for
through
all
his
stay
his
talk
was
so
bright
and
strong
that
it
met
the
needs
of
both
hearers
even
diana
laughed
with
him
and
listened
to
him
and
when
he
rose
to
take
leave
she
asked
if
he
came
on
horseback
no
i
am
i
borrowed
chalmers
buggy
which
way
are
you
going
now
sir
if
you
please
he
hesitated
an
instant
looked
at
her
and
answered
quite
demurely
i
think
your
way
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
take
me
so
far
as
home
with
you
then
i
do
see
any
objection
to
that
said
basil
in
the
same
cool
manner
and
diana
hastily
took
her
bonnet
and
kissed
her
old
friend
and
in
another
minute
or
two
she
was
in
the
buggy
and
they
were
driving
off
if
the
minister
suspected
somewhat
he
would
spoil
nothing
by
being
in
a
hurry
he
drove
leisurely
saying
that
it
was
too
hot
weather
to
ask
much
exertion
even
from
a
horse
and
making
little
slight
remarks
in
a
manner
so
gentle
and
quiet
as
to
be
very
reassuring
but
if
that
was
what
diana
wanted
she
wanted
a
great
deal
of
it
for
she
sat
looking
straight
between
the
edges
of
her
absolutely
silent
hardly
even
making
the
replies
her
companion
words
called
for
at
last
he
was
silent
too
the
good
grey
horse
went
very
soberly
on
not
urged
at
all
but
yet
even
a
slow
rate
of
motion
will
take
you
to
the
end
of
anything
given
the
time
and
every
minute
saw
the
rods
of
diana
road
getting
behind
her
i
suppose
she
felt
that
and
spoke
at
last
in
the
desperate
sense
of
it
when
a
person
is
under
that
urgency
he
does
not
always
choose
his
words
masters
is
there
any
way
of
making
life
anything
but
a
miserable
failure
the
lowered
cadences
of
diana
voice
a
thread
of
bitterness
in
her
utterance
quite
turned
the
minister
thought
from
anything
like
a
light
or
a
gay
answer
he
said
very
gravely
nobody
life
need
be
that
how
are
you
to
get
rid
of
it
of
that
result
you
mean
yes
will
you
state
the
difficulty
as
it
appears
to
you
why
look
at
it
said
diana
more
hesitatingly
what
do
most
people
lives
amount
to
what
does
mine
to
dress
oneself
and
eat
and
drink
and
go
through
a
round
of
things
which
only
mean
that
you
will
dress
yourself
and
eat
and
drink
again
and
do
the
same
things
and
the
next
day
what
does
it
all
amount
to
in
the
end
is
life
no
more
than
that
to
you
diana
hesitated
but
then
with
a
tone
still
lowered
said
no
the
minister
was
silent
now
and
presently
diana
went
on
again
the
whole
world
seems
to
me
just
so
people
live
and
die
and
they
might
just
as
well
not
have
lived
for
all
that
their
being
in
the
world
has
done
and
yet
they
have
lived
and
suffered
more
than
she
knew
was
told
in
the
utterance
of
that
last
word
the
minister
was
still
not
in
a
hurry
to
speak
when
he
did
his
question
came
as
a
surprise
you
believe
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
miss
diana
certainly
she
said
feeling
with
downcast
heart
o
now
a
sermon
you
believe
that
god
made
the
earth
and
made
man
to
occupy
it
yes
certainly
what
do
you
think
he
made
him
for
i
know
what
the
catechism
says
diana
began
slowly
no
no
my
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
catechism
do
you
believe
that
the
creator
intention
was
that
men
should
live
purposeless
lives
like
what
you
describe
i
ca
believe
it
then
what
purpose
are
we
here
for
why
am
i
and
why
are
you
on
the
earth
i
do
know
said
diana
faintly
the
talk
was
not
turning
out
well
for
her
wish
she
thought
to
find
that
out
and
to
get
in
harmony
with
the
answer
is
the
great
secret
of
life
will
you
help
me
mr
masters
said
diana
humbly
it
is
all
dark
and
wild
to
me
i
see
no
comfort
in
anything
if
there
were
nothing
better
than
this
one
would
rather
be
on
the
earth
masters
might
have
pondered
with
a
little
surprise
on
the
strength
of
the
currents
that
flow
sometimes
where
the
water
looks
calm
but
he
had
no
time
and
in
truth
was
in
no
mood
for
moralizing
just
then
his
answer
was
somewhat
abrupt
though
gentle
as
possible
what
do
you
want
miss
diana
but
the
answer
to
that
was
a
choked
sob
and
then
breaking
all
bounds
of
her
habit
and
intention
a
passionate
storm
of
tears
diana
was
frightened
at
herself
but
nevertheless
the
sudden
probe
of
the
question
with
the
sympathetic
gentleness
of
it
and
the
too
great
contrast
between
the
speaker
happy
calm
strong
content
and
her
own
disordered
distracted
life
suddenly
broke
her
down
neither
if
you
open
the
to
such
a
current
can
you
immediately
get
them
shut
again
this
she
found
though
greatly
afraid
of
the
conclusions
her
companion
might
draw
for
a
few
minutes
her
passion
was
utterly
uncontrolled
if
basil
drew
conclusions
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
make
them
known
he
did
not
at
that
time
follow
the
conversation
any
further
only
remarking
cheerfully
and
sympathetically
too
we
must
have
some
more
talk
about
this
miss
diana
but
we
take
another
opportunity
and
so
presently
left
her
at
her
own
door
with
the
warm
strong
grasp
of
the
hand
that
many
a
one
in
trouble
had
learned
to
know
there
is
strange
intelligence
somehow
in
our
fingers
they
can
say
what
lips
fail
to
say
diana
went
into
the
house
feeling
that
her
minister
was
a
tower
of
strength
and
a
treasury
of
kindness
she
found
company
flandin
and
her
mother
were
sitting
together
hev
you
come
home
to
stay
diana
was
her
mother
sarcastic
salutation
how
come
you
and
the
dominie
to
be
a
ridin
together
was
the
other
lady
blunter
question
i
had
the
chance
said
diana
and
i
asked
him
to
bring
me
it
too
hot
for
walking
and
how
come
he
to
be
in
a
buggy
so
convenient
he
always
goes
tearin
round
on
the
back
of
that
grey
horse
i
thought
i
never
see
a
minister
ride
so
afore
and
i
do
mis
starling
suitable
what
if
he
was
to
break
his
neck
on
the
way
to
visit
some
sick
man
jim
treadwell
broke
neck
out
of
a
waggon
responded
starling
ah
well
there
ai
no
security
no
place
but
do
it
strike
you
now
mis
starling
that
a
minister
had
ought
to
set
an
example
of
steady
goin
and
not
turn
the
heads
of
the
young
men
and
young
women
with
his
capers
he
is
a
young
man
himself
flandin
diana
was
bold
to
say
wall
i
know
he
is
said
the
lady
in
a
disapproving
way
i
know
he
is
and
he
ca
help
it
but
if
i
had
my
way
i
allays
have
a
minister
as
much
as
fifty
year
old
it
looks
better
said
flandin
complacently
and
it
better
what
is
he
to
do
all
the
first
fifty
years
of
his
life
then
wall
my
dear
i
hai
got
the
arrangement
of
things
i
do
know
i
know
will
would
hitch
up
and
carry
you
anywheres
you
want
to
go
if
it
a
waggon
you
want
any
time
after
that
will
made
good
his
mother
promise
so
far
as
intentions
went
he
was
generally
on
hand
when
anything
was
to
be
done
in
which
himself
and
his
smart
buggy
could
be
useful
indeed
he
was
very
often
on
hand
at
other
times
dropping
in
after
supper
and
appearing
with
baskets
which
were
found
to
contain
some
of
the
flandin
pears
or
the
fine
red
apples
that
grew
in
a
corner
of
the
lot
and
were
famous
some
of
his
own
bees
honey
will
brought
another
time
and
a
bushel
of
uncommonly
fine
nuts
of
course
this
was
in
the
fall
to
which
the
weary
weeks
of
diana
summer
had
at
length
dragged
themselves
out
but
if
will
hoped
that
honey
would
sweeten
diana
reception
of
him
and
his
attentions
as
yet
it
did
not
seem
to
have
the
desired
effect
in
truth
though
will
could
never
suspect
it
her
brain
was
so
heavy
with
other
thoughts
that
she
was
only
in
a
vague
and
general
way
conscious
of
his
presence
and
of
his
officious
gallantries
scarcely
aware
so
little
aware
indeed
of
their
bearing
that
on
two
or
three
occasions
she
suffered
herself
to
be
conveyed
in
will
buggy
to
or
from
some
gathering
of
the
neighbours
starling
or
flandin
had
arranged
it
and
diana
had
quite
blindly
fallen
into
the
trap
and
then
the
young
man
not
unreasonably
elated
and
inspirited
began
to
make
his
visits
to
starling
house
more
frequent
than
ever
it
was
little
he
did
to
recommend
himself
when
he
was
there
he
generally
sat
watching
diana
carrying
on
a
spasmodic
and
interrupted
conversation
with
starling
about
farm
affairs
and
seizing
the
opportunity
of
a
dropped
spool
or
an
unwound
skein
of
yarn
to
draw
near
diana
and
venture
some
word
to
her
poor
diana
felt
in
those
days
so
much
like
a
person
whose
earthly
ties
are
all
broken
that
it
did
not
come
into
her
head
in
what
a
different
light
she
stood
to
other
eyes
chapter
xviii
a
snowstorm
as
the
weeks
of
september
rolled
away
they
brought
by
the
necessary
force
of
associations
a
sharp
waking
up
to
diana
torpor
these
last
year
had
been
the
weeks
of
her
happiness
happiness
had
come
to
her
dressed
in
these
robes
of
autumn
light
and
colour
and
now
every
breath
of
the
soft
atmosphere
every
gleam
from
the
changing
foliage
the
light
peculiar
tone
and
the
soft
indolence
of
the
hazy
days
stole
into
the
recesses
of
diana
heart
and
smote
on
the
nerves
that
answered
every
touch
with
vibrations
of
pain
the
aeolian
harp
that
had
sounded
such
soft
harmonies
a
year
ago
when
the
notes
rose
and
fell
in
breathings
of
joy
clanged
now
with
sharp
and
keen
discords
that
diana
could
scarcely
bear
the
time
of
blackberries
passed
without
her
joining
the
yearly
party
which
went
as
usual
she
escaped
that
but
there
was
no
escaping
september
and
when
in
due
course
the
time
for
the
equinoctial
storms
came
and
the
storms
did
not
fail
though
coming
this
year
somewhat
later
than
the
last
diana
felt
like
a
person
wakened
up
to
life
to
die
the
second
time
her
mood
all
changed
from
a
dull
miserable
apathy
which
yet
had
somewhat
of
the
numbness
of
death
in
it
she
woke
up
to
the
intense
life
of
pain
and
to
a
corresponding
but
in
her
most
unwonted
irritability
of
feeling
all
of
a
sudden
as
it
were
she
grew
sensitive
to
whatever
in
her
life
and
surroundings
was
untoward
or
trying
she
read
through
will
flandin
devotion
she
saw
what
her
mother
was
driving
at
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
and
the
whole
reality
of
her
relations
to
evan
and
his
relations
to
her
stood
in
colours
as
distinct
as
those
of
the
red
and
green
maple
leaves
and
unsoftened
by
the
least
haze
of
in
the
dash
of
the
rain
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
in
the
familiar
swirl
of
the
elm
branches
she
read
as
it
were
her
sentence
of
death
before
this
she
had
not
been
dead
only
stunned
now
she
was
wakened
up
to
die
nature
herself
which
had
been
so
kind
a
year
ago
brought
her
now
the
irrevocable
message
a
whole
year
had
gone
by
a
year
of
silence
it
was
merely
impossible
that
evan
could
be
true
to
her
if
he
had
been
true
he
would
have
overleaped
all
barriers
rather
than
let
this
silence
last
but
indeed
he
had
no
barriers
to
overleap
he
had
only
to
write
and
he
had
plenty
of
time
for
it
might
have
overleaped
barriers
earlier
in
the
year
if
she
could
have
known
the
case
was
so
desperate
and
yet
diana
reflected
she
could
not
and
would
not
even
so
it
was
well
she
had
not
tried
for
if
evan
needed
to
be
held
she
would
not
put
out
a
finger
to
hold
him
of
this
change
in
diana
mood
it
is
safe
to
say
that
nothing
was
visible
feeling
as
if
every
nerve
and
sense
were
become
an
avenue
of
living
pain
dying
mentally
a
slow
death
she
showed
nothing
of
it
to
others
mind
and
body
were
so
sound
and
strong
and
the
poise
of
her
nature
was
matched
with
such
a
sweet
dignity
that
she
was
able
to
go
through
her
usual
round
of
duties
in
quite
her
usual
way
die
and
make
no
sign
nothing
was
neglected
in
any
wise
nothing
was
slurred
or
hurried
over
thoroughly
diligently
punctually
she
did
the
work
from
which
all
heart
was
gone
out
and
even
starling
keen
enough
to
see
anything
if
only
she
had
a
clue
to
it
watched
and
saw
nothing
for
diana
cheek
had
been
pale
for
a
good
while
now
and
she
had
never
been
a
talkative
person
lately
less
than
ever
so
the
fact
that
in
these
days
she
never
talked
at
all
did
not
strike
her
mother
but
such
power
of
is
a
dangerous
gift
for
a
woman
no
doubt
the
extreme
bustle
and
variety
of
the
autumn
and
early
winter
work
helped
starling
to
shut
her
eyes
to
what
she
did
not
want
to
see
helped
diana
too
fall
ploughing
and
sowing
were
to
be
attended
to
laying
down
the
winter
butter
storing
the
vegetables
disposing
of
the
grain
fatting
cattle
wood
cutting
and
hauling
and
repairing
of
fences
which
starling
always
had
done
punctually
in
the
fall
as
soon
as
the
ploughs
were
put
up
for
nothing
under
care
was
ever
left
at
loose
ends
there
was
not
a
better
farmer
in
pleasant
valley
than
she
then
the
winter
closed
in
early
in
those
rather
high
latitudes
and
time
came
when
for
some
time
nothing
was
even
thought
of
in
the
house
but
pork
in
its
various
forms
lard
sausage
bacon
and
hams
with
extras
of
souse
and
headcheese
snow
had
fallen
already
and
winter
was
setting
in
betimes
the
knowing
ones
said
so
came
one
sunday
a
little
before
christmas
it
brought
a
lull
in
the
midst
of
the
pork
business
hands
were
washed
finally
for
the
whole
day
and
the
kitchen
redd
up
the
weariness
of
diana
nerves
welcomed
the
respite
for
business
which
oftimes
is
a
help
to
bearing
pain
in
some
moods
aggravates
it
at
every
touch
and
diana
was
glad
to
think
that
she
might
go
into
her
own
room
and
lock
the
door
and
be
alone
with
her
misery
the
day
was
cloudy
and
threatening
and
starling
had
avowed
her
purpose
not
to
go
to
church
she
was
tuckered
out
she
said
and
i
am
sure
the
sabbath
was
given
us
for
rest
diana
made
no
answer
she
was
washing
up
the
breakfast
things
i
guess
we
ai
early
neither
starling
went
on
well
one
day
in
seven
folks
must
sleep
and
i
did
get
that
headcheese
out
of
my
hands
till
eleven
i
guess
it
diana
we
try
a
bit
this
noon
who
that
stoppin
will
flandin
if
i
see
straight
that
thoughtful
of
him
now
he
take
you
to
church
di
will
he
thought
diana
flandin
came
in
dressed
in
his
sunday
best
he
always
seemed
to
diana
specially
lumbering
and
awkward
and
his
hair
was
massed
into
smoothness
by
means
of
i
know
not
what
bountiful
lubrication
which
looked
very
greasy
and
smelt
very
strong
of
cloves
his
necktie
was
blue
with
yellow
spots
about
the
right
thing
will
thought
it
was
strange
what
a
disgust
it
gave
diana
what
in
a
necktie
goin
to
snow
will
asked
starling
wall
guess
likely
not
jes
yet
though
your
mother
got
through
with
her
pork
wall
i
guess
not
seems
to
me
ef
she
was
through
there
would
be
so
many
pickle
tubs
round
good
weight
wall
fair
better
than
that
tell
you
what
will
your
pigs
do
get
the
sunshine
enough
do
reckon
they
know
the
difference
said
will
smiling
and
glancing
over
towards
diana
but
diana
was
gone
were
you
to
go
to
meetin
mis
starling
guess
not
will
i
gettin
too
old
to
work
seven
days
in
a
week
in
time
anyhow
i
calculatin
to
stay
home
diana
always
for
goin
though
she
gone
to
get
ready
i
guess
she
ai
tired
silence
diana
room
was
too
far
off
for
them
to
hear
her
moving
about
and
starling
sat
down
and
stretched
out
her
feet
towards
the
fire
both
parties
meditating
you
and
she
hai
come
to
any
understanding
yet
the
lady
began
will
shifted
his
position
uneasily
and
spoke
not
i
would
wait
long
if
i
was
you
she
might
take
a
notion
to
somebody
else
you
know
and
then
you
and
me
be
nowhere
has
she
mis
starling
will
asked
terrified
she
hai
told
nothing
of
it
if
she
has
and
i
hai
seen
her
look
sweet
on
anybody
but
she
might
you
know
will
if
anybody
came
along
that
she
fancied
i
always
like
to
get
the
halter
over
my
head
and
then
i
know
i
got
him
the
image
suggested
nothing
but
difficulty
to
will
imagination
a
halter
over
diana
stately
neck
i
allays
catch
a
horse
by
cornerin
him
he
said
sheepishly
and
again
moving
restlessly
in
his
chair
that
wo
answer
in
this
chase
said
starling
diana
walk
up
to
you
of
her
own
accord
if
she
comes
at
all
but
you
must
hold
out
your
hand
will
ai
i
that
all
the
while
mis
starling
said
will
whom
every
one
of
his
friend
utterances
seemed
to
put
farther
and
farther
away
from
his
goal
i
reckon
she
come
all
right
said
starling
reassuringly
but
you
know
girls
ai
obliged
to
see
anybody
hand
till
they
have
to
you
all
like
better
for
bein
skittish
i
do
she
skittish
with
me
neither
and
she
wo
be
with
you
when
caught
her
once
take
your
time
only
i
would
be
long
about
it
as
i
said
poor
will
the
sweat
stood
upon
his
brow
with
the
prospect
of
what
was
before
him
perhaps
that
very
day
for
what
time
could
be
better
for
holding
out
his
hand
to
diana
than
a
solitary
sleigh
ride
then
if
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
would
see
it
diana
had
as
stated
left
the
kitchen
and
mounted
the
stairs
with
a
peculiarly
quick
light
tread
which
meant
business
for
the
fact
was
that
she
did
discern
the
holding
out
of
will
hand
and
was
taking
a
sudden
sheer
nothing
but
the
sheer
was
quite
distinct
to
her
mind
as
she
set
her
foot
upon
the
stair
but
before
she
reached
the
top
she
knew
what
she
would
do
her
mother
was
not
going
to
church
will
flandin
was
and
the
plan
she
saw
was
fixed
that
he
should
drive
herself
her
mother
would
oblige
her
to
go
or
else
if
she
made
a
determined
stand
will
on
the
other
hand
would
not
go
and
she
would
have
to
endure
him
platitudes
blue
necktie
cloves
and
all
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
only
one
escape
was
left
her
with
the
swiftness
and
accuracy
of
movement
which
is
possible
in
a
moment
of
excitement
to
senses
and
faculties
habitually
deft
and
true
diana
changed
her
dress
put
on
the
grey
thick
coarse
wrappings
which
were
very
necessary
for
any
one
going
in
pleasant
valley
took
her
hood
in
her
hand
and
slipped
down
the
stairs
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
gone
up
it
was
not
needful
that
she
should
go
through
the
kitchen
where
her
mother
and
her
visitor
were
there
was
a
side
door
happily
and
without
being
seen
or
heard
diana
reached
the
barn
the
rest
was
easy
prince
was
fast
by
his
halter
instead
of
wandering
at
will
over
the
sunny
meadow
and
without
any
delay
or
difficulty
diana
got
his
harness
on
and
hitched
him
to
the
small
cutter
which
was
wont
to
convey
herself
and
her
mother
to
church
and
wherever
else
they
wanted
to
go
in
winter
time
only
diana
carefully
took
the
precaution
to
remove
the
sleigh
bells
from
the
rest
of
prince
harness
then
she
led
him
out
of
the
barn
where
she
had
harnessed
him
closed
the
barn
doors
securely
remembering
how
they
had
been
left
on
another
occasion
mounted
and
drove
slowly
away
it
had
been
a
dreamy
piece
of
work
to
her
for
it
had
so
fallen
out
that
she
had
never
once
harnessed
prince
again
since
that
june
day
when
she
indeed
did
not
harness
him
but
had
been
about
it
when
somebody
else
had
taken
the
work
out
of
her
hand
it
was
very
bitter
to
diana
to
handle
the
bridle
and
the
traces
that
had
handled
that
day
she
did
it
with
fingers
that
seemed
to
sting
with
pain
at
every
touch
her
brain
got
into
a
whirl
and
when
she
finally
drove
off
it
was
rather
instinctively
that
she
went
slowly
and
made
no
sound
for
will
and
his
hopes
and
his
wooing
and
his
presence
had
faded
out
of
her
imagination
she
went
slowly
until
she
also
instinctively
knew
that
she
was
safe
and
then
still
she
went
slowly
prince
chose
his
own
gait
diana
with
the
reins
slack
in
her
hand
sat
still
and
thought
there
was
no
need
for
hurry
it
was
not
near
church
time
not
yet
even
time
will
would
be
quiet
for
a
while
yet
before
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
any
after
the
runaway
and
she
and
prince
would
be
far
beyond
ken
by
that
time
and
meanwhile
there
was
something
soothing
in
the
mere
being
alone
under
the
wide
grey
sky
nobody
to
watch
her
nothing
to
exert
herself
about
for
a
few
moments
in
her
life
diana
could
be
still
and
drift
whither
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
chafing
of
home
her
mother
driving
and
will
courting
were
becoming
intolerable
heart
and
brain
were
strained
and
sore
if
she
could
be
still
till
she
died
diana
felt
it
to
be
the
utmost
limit
of
desirableness
she
knew
she
was
not
likely
to
die
soon
brain
and
nerve
might
be
strained
but
they
were
sound
and
whole
the
full
capacity
for
suffering
the
unimpaired
energy
for
doing
were
hers
yet
and
stillness
was
not
likely
to
be
granted
her
it
was
inexpressibly
suitable
to
diana
mood
to
sit
quiet
in
the
sleigh
and
let
prince
walk
and
feel
alone
and
know
that
no
one
could
disturb
her
a
few
small
flakes
of
snow
were
beginning
to
flit
aimlessly
about
their
soft
wavering
motion
suggested
nothing
ruder
than
that
same
purposeless
drift
towards
which
diana
whole
soul
was
going
out
in
yearning
if
she
had
been
in
a
german
fairy
tale
the
would
have
seemed
to
her
spirits
of
peace
she
welcomed
them
she
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
two
or
three
and
then
brought
them
close
to
look
at
them
the
little
fair
crystals
lay
still
on
her
glove
it
was
too
cold
for
them
to
melt
o
to
be
like
that
thought
diana
cold
and
alone
but
she
was
in
no
wise
like
that
but
a
living
human
creature
warm
at
heart
and
quick
in
brain
in
the
midst
of
humanity
obliged
to
fight
out
or
watch
through
the
and
take
blows
and
wounds
as
they
came
ah
she
would
not
have
minded
the
blows
or
the
wounds
she
would
have
girded
herself
joyfully
for
the
struggle
were
it
twice
as
long
or
hard
but
now
there
was
nothing
left
to
fight
for
the
fight
looked
dreary
she
longed
to
creep
into
a
corner
under
some
cover
and
get
rid
of
it
all
no
cover
was
in
sight
diana
knew
with
the
subtle
instinct
of
power
that
she
was
one
of
those
who
must
stand
in
the
front
ranks
and
take
the
responsibility
of
her
own
and
probably
of
others
destinies
she
could
not
creep
into
a
corner
and
be
still
there
was
work
to
do
and
diana
never
shirked
work
vaguely
even
now
as
prince
walked
along
and
she
was
revelling
so
to
speak
in
the
loveliness
and
the
peace
of
momentary
immunity
she
began
to
look
at
the
question
how
and
where
her
stand
must
be
and
her
work
be
done
not
as
will
flandin
wife
she
thought
no
she
could
never
be
that
but
her
mother
would
urge
and
press
it
how
much
worry
of
that
sort
could
she
stand
when
she
was
longing
for
rest
would
her
mother
persistence
conquer
in
the
end
just
because
her
own
spirit
was
gone
for
contending
no
never
not
will
flandin
if
she
died
for
it
anything
else
the
truth
was
the
girl
was
so
dead
within
her
that
for
the
time
she
looked
upon
all
things
in
the
universe
through
a
veil
of
unreality
what
did
it
matter
one
thing
or
the
other
what
did
it
signify
any
longer
which
way
she
took
through
the
wilderness
of
this
world
diana
senses
were
benumbed
she
no
longer
recognised
the
forms
of
things
nor
their
possible
hard
edges
nor
the
perspectives
of
time
life
seemed
unending
long
it
is
true
to
look
forward
to
but
she
saw
it
not
in
perspective
but
as
if
in
a
nightmare
it
were
all
in
mass
pressing
upon
her
and
taking
away
her
breath
so
what
did
points
here
and
there
amount
to
what
did
it
matter
any
more
than
this
snow
which
was
beginning
to
come
down
so
fast
fast
and
thick
the
aimless
scattering
crystals
which
had
come
fluttering
about
as
if
uncertain
about
reaching
earth
at
all
had
given
place
to
a
dense
swift
driving
storm
without
much
wind
perceptible
yet
the
snowfall
came
with
a
steady
straight
drift
which
spoke
of
an
impelling
force
somewhere
might
it
be
only
the
weight
of
the
cloud
reservoirs
from
which
it
came
it
came
in
a
way
that
could
no
longer
be
ignored
the
crystals
struck
diana
face
and
hands
with
the
force
of
small
missiles
but
just
now
she
had
been
going
through
a
grey
and
brown
lonely
landscape
it
was
covered
up
and
nothing
to
see
but
this
white
downfall
even
the
nearest
outlines
were
hidden
she
could
barely
distinguish
the
fences
on
either
hand
of
her
road
nothing
further
trees
and
hills
were
all
swallowed
up
and
the
road
itself
was
not
discernible
at
a
very
few
paces
distance
indeed
it
was
not
too
easy
to
keep
her
eyes
open
to
see
anything
so
beat
the
crystals
sharp
and
fast
into
her
face
diana
smiled
to
herself
to
think
that
she
was
safe
now
from
even
distant
pursuit
no
fear
that
flandin
would
by
and
by
come
up
with
her
or
even
make
his
appearance
at
the
church
at
all
that
day
the
storm
was
violent
enough
to
keep
any
one
from
venturing
out
of
doors
or
to
make
any
one
turn
back
to
his
house
who
had
already
left
it
diana
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
the
more
impossible
the
storm
made
other
people
travelling
the
better
it
was
for
hers
prince
knew
the
way
well
enough
and
could
go
to
church
like
a
christian
she
left
the
way
to
him
and
enjoyed
the
strange
joy
of
being
alone
beyond
vision
or
pursuit
set
aside
as
it
were
from
her
life
and
life
surroundings
for
a
time
what
did
she
care
how
hard
the
storm
beat
to
the
rough
treatment
of
life
this
was
as
the
touch
of
a
soft
feather
diana
welcomed
it
loved
the
storm
bent
her
head
to
shield
her
from
the
blast
of
it
and
went
on
the
wind
began
to
make
itself
known
as
one
of
the
forces
abroad
but
she
did
not
mind
that
either
gusts
came
by
turns
sweeping
the
snow
in
what
seemed
a
solid
mass
upon
her
shoulder
and
side
face
and
then
in
a
little
time
more
there
was
no
question
of
gusts
but
a
steady
wild
fury
which
knew
no
intermission
the
storm
grew
tremendous
and
everybody
in
pleasant
valley
was
well
aware
that
such
storms
in
those
regions
did
not
go
as
soon
as
they
came
diana
herself
began
to
feel
glad
that
she
must
be
near
her
no
landmarks
whatever
were
visible
but
she
thought
she
had
been
travelling
long
enough
even
at
prince
slow
rate
to
put
most
of
the
three
miles
behind
her
and
she
grew
a
little
afraid
lest
in
the
white
darkness
she
might
miss
the
little
church
once
past
it
though
never
so
little
and
looking
back
would
be
in
vain
it
was
a
question
if
she
would
not
pass
it
even
with
her
best
endeavour
in
her
preoccupation
it
had
never
once
occurred
to
diana
to
speculate
on
what
she
would
find
at
the
church
if
she
reached
it
and
now
she
had
but
one
thought
not
to
miss
reaching
it
she
had
some
anxious
minutes
of
watching
for
her
rate
of
travelling
had
been
slower
than
she
knew
and
there
was
a
good
piece
of
a
mile
still
between
her
and
the
place
when
she
began
to
look
for
it
now
she
eyed
with
greatest
care
the
road
and
the
fences
when
she
could
see
the
latter
and
indeed
it
is
poetical
to
speak
of
her
seeing
the
road
for
the
tracks
were
all
covered
up
but
at
last
diana
recognised
a
break
in
the
fence
at
her
left
checked
prince
turned
his
head
carefully
in
that
direction
found
he
seemed
to
think
it
all
right
and
presently
saw
just
before
her
the
long
low
shed
in
which
the
country
people
were
wont
to
tie
their
horses
for
the
time
of
divine
service
prince
went
straight
to
his
accustomed
place
diana
got
out
there
was
no
need
to
tie
prince
the
usual
equine
sense
of
expediency
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
keep
any
horse
under
cover
she
left
the
sleigh
and
groped
her
way
truly
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
on
her
feet
the
wind
blew
so
till
she
saw
the
little
white
church
just
before
her
there
was
not
a
on
the
snow
which
covered
the
steps
leading
to
the
door
but
the
wind
and
the
snow
would
cover
up
or
blow
away
any
such
tracks
in
very
short
time
she
reflected
yet
what
if
the
door
were
locked
and
nobody
there
one
moment
her
heart
stood
still
no
things
were
better
than
that
the
door
yielded
to
her
hand
diana
went
in
welcomed
by
the
warm
atmosphere
which
contrasted
so
pleasantly
with
the
wind
and
the
shut
the
door
shook
herself
and
opened
one
of
the
inner
doors
which
led
into
the
audience
room
of
the
building
chapter
xix
out
of
humdrum
warm
how
good
and
warm
but
empty
perfectly
empty
perfectly
still
empty
pews
and
empty
pulpit
nobody
not
a
head
visible
anywhere
not
a
breath
to
be
heard
the
place
was
awful
it
was
like
the
ghost
of
a
church
all
the
life
out
of
it
but
how
then
came
it
to
be
warm
somebody
must
have
made
the
fires
where
was
somebody
gone
and
had
none
of
all
the
congregation
come
to
church
that
day
was
it
too
bad
for
everybody
diana
began
to
wake
up
to
facts
as
she
heard
the
blast
drive
against
the
windows
and
listened
to
the
swirl
of
it
round
the
house
and
how
was
she
going
to
get
home
if
it
was
so
bad
as
that
at
any
rate
here
was
still
solitude
and
quiet
and
freedom
she
could
get
warm
and
enjoy
it
for
awhile
and
let
prince
rest
she
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
she
turned
to
go
to
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
where
the
stoves
were
screened
off
by
high
screens
in
the
interest
of
the
neighbouring
pews
and
then
just
at
the
corner
of
the
screen
from
where
he
had
been
watching
her
she
saw
masters
diana
did
not
know
whether
to
be
sorry
or
glad
on
the
whole
she
rather
thought
she
was
glad
the
church
was
eerie
all
alone
mr
masters
i
thought
nobody
was
here
i
thought
nobody
was
going
to
be
here
good
morning
who
else
is
coming
who
else
nobody
i
guess
how
am
i
to
understand
that
just
so
said
diana
coming
up
to
the
stove
and
putting
her
fingers
out
towards
the
warmth
where
is
the
other
half
of
your
family
i
left
mother
at
home
you
came
alone
yes
i
came
alone
diana
began
to
wonder
a
little
at
the
situation
in
which
she
found
herself
and
to
revolve
in
her
mind
how
she
could
make
use
of
it
miss
diana
you
have
dared
what
no
one
else
has
dared
it
was
not
daring
said
the
girl
i
did
not
think
much
of
the
storm
till
i
was
so
far
on
the
way
that
it
was
as
easy
to
come
on
as
to
go
back
a
light
rejoinder
which
would
have
been
given
to
anybody
else
was
checked
on
masters
lips
by
the
abstracted
apart
air
with
which
these
words
were
spoken
he
gave
one
or
two
inquisitive
glances
at
the
speaker
and
was
silent
diana
roused
herself
has
nobody
at
all
come
to
church
nobody
but
clair
he
was
the
old
sexton
and
he
has
such
a
bad
cold
that
i
took
pity
on
him
and
sent
him
home
i
promised
him
i
would
shut
up
the
church
for
him
when
it
was
necessary
to
leave
it
was
in
no
condition
to
be
preached
to
he
half
expected
diana
would
propose
the
shutting
up
of
the
church
at
once
and
the
ensuing
return
home
of
the
two
people
there
but
instead
of
that
she
drew
up
a
stool
and
sat
down
you
will
not
be
able
to
preach
she
remarked
not
to
much
of
a
congregation
said
the
minister
i
will
do
my
best
with
what
i
have
are
you
going
to
preach
to
me
said
diana
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
if
you
demand
it
you
have
an
undoubted
right
diana
sat
silent
the
warmth
of
the
room
was
very
pleasant
also
the
security
not
from
the
storm
which
howled
and
dashed
upon
the
windows
and
raged
round
the
building
and
the
world
generally
but
from
that
other
storm
and
whirl
of
life
diana
did
not
want
just
yet
to
be
at
home
furthermore
she
had
a
dim
notion
of
using
her
opportunity
she
thought
how
she
could
do
it
and
the
minister
standing
by
watched
her
with
some
secret
anxiety
but
an
extremely
calm
exterior
you
must
give
me
the
text
miss
diana
he
ventured
presently
diana
sat
still
musing
masters
she
said
at
last
very
slowly
in
order
that
the
composure
of
it
might
be
perfect
will
you
tell
me
what
is
the
good
of
life
to
yourself
you
mean
yes
for
me
or
for
anybody
i
should
say
briefly
that
god
makes
all
his
creatures
to
be
happy
happy
echoed
diana
with
more
sharpness
of
accent
than
she
knew
yes
but
masters
suppose
suppose
that
is
impossible
it
never
is
impossible
that
sounds
like
mockery
said
diana
only
you
never
do
say
mocking
things
i
do
not
about
this
but
mr
masters
surely
there
are
a
great
many
people
in
the
world
that
are
not
happy
a
sorrowful
truth
how
comes
diana
starling
to
be
one
of
them
and
saying
this
the
minister
himself
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
the
question
was
daring
but
the
whole
way
and
manner
of
the
man
were
so
quiet
and
gentle
so
sympathizing
and
firm
at
once
that
it
would
have
lured
a
bird
off
its
nest
much
more
the
brooding
reserve
from
a
heart
it
is
not
nursing
but
killing
diana
looked
at
him
met
the
wise
kind
grave
eye
she
had
learned
long
ago
to
trust
and
broke
down
all
of
a
sudden
she
had
not
dreamed
she
was
in
any
danger
she
was
as
much
surprised
as
he
was
but
that
helped
nothing
diana
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
he
looked
very
much
concerned
wisely
however
he
kept
perfectly
quiet
and
let
the
storm
pass
the
little
inner
storm
which
caused
the
outer
violence
of
winds
and
clouds
to
be
for
the
time
forgotten
diana
sobbed
bitterly
when
after
a
few
minutes
she
checked
herself
the
minister
went
off
and
brought
her
a
glass
of
water
diana
lifted
her
flushed
face
and
drank
it
making
no
word
of
excuse
or
apology
as
he
took
the
glass
back
masters
spoke
in
the
tone
of
mixed
sympathy
and
authority
it
was
a
winning
kind
of
authority
which
was
peculiar
to
him
now
miss
diana
what
is
it
but
there
was
a
long
pause
diana
was
regaining
and
searching
for
words
the
minister
was
patient
and
waited
there
seems
to
be
nothing
left
in
life
she
said
at
last
except
duty
you
mean
there
is
enough
of
that
common
sort
of
duties
but
duty
is
very
cold
and
bare
if
it
is
all
alone
mr
masters
undoubtedly
true
but
who
has
told
you
that
your
life
must
be
filled
with
only
common
sorts
of
duties
it
has
nothing
else
said
diana
despondently
and
i
look
forward
and
see
nothing
else
and
when
i
think
of
living
on
and
on
so
my
brain
almost
turns
and
i
wonder
why
i
was
made
not
to
live
so
our
maker
meant
none
of
us
to
live
a
humdrum
life
do
you
know
we
were
intended
for
honour
and
immortality
how
can
one
get
out
of
humdrum
diana
asked
disconsolately
by
living
to
god
i
do
understand
you
you
understand
how
a
woman
can
live
to
a
beloved
human
creature
doing
everything
in
the
thought
and
the
joy
of
her
affection
was
he
probing
her
secret
diana
breath
came
short
she
sat
with
eyes
cast
down
and
a
feeling
of
oppression
growing
pale
with
her
pain
but
she
said
well
let
it
be
god
instead
of
a
your
life
will
have
no
humdrum
then
but
one
can
only
love
what
one
knows
said
diana
speaking
carefully
precisely
and
the
bible
cry
to
men
is
that
they
would
the
lord
for
want
of
that
knowledge
all
goes
wild
do
you
mean
that
that
will
take
the
place
of
everything
else
said
diana
lifting
her
weary
eyes
to
him
they
were
strong
beautiful
eyes
too
but
the
light
of
hope
was
gone
and
all
sparkle
of
pleasure
out
of
them
the
look
struck
to
the
minister
heart
he
answered
however
with
no
change
of
tone
i
mean
that
it
more
than
takes
the
place
of
everything
else
not
replace
what
is
lost
said
diana
sadly
more
than
replace
it
even
when
one
has
lost
all
that
ca
be
that
must
be
impossible
sometimes
said
diana
i
do
believe
you
know
yes
i
do
said
the
minister
gravely
people
would
not
be
human
very
human
tenderly
human
do
you
really
think
miss
diana
that
he
who
made
our
hearts
made
them
larger
than
he
himself
can
fill
diana
sat
silent
a
while
and
the
minister
stood
considering
her
his
heart
strained
with
sympathy
and
longing
to
give
her
help
and
at
the
same
time
doubting
how
far
he
might
or
dared
venture
diana
on
her
part
fearing
to
show
too
much
but
remembering
also
that
this
chance
might
never
repeat
itself
the
fear
of
losing
it
began
to
overtop
all
other
fear
so
she
began
again
but
mr
masters
this
that
you
speak
of
i
have
got
it
and
i
do
understand
it
what
shall
i
do
get
it
how
seek
it
in
the
appointed
way
what
is
that
jesus
said
that
hath
my
commandments
and
keepeth
them
he
it
is
that
loveth
me
and
he
that
loveth
me
shall
be
loved
of
my
father
and
i
will
love
him
and
manifest
myself
to
but
i
do
not
love
him
then
pray
as
moses
prayed
beseech
thee
show
me
thy
glory
diana
head
sank
a
little
i
have
no
heart
to
give
to
anything
she
confessed
what
has
become
of
it
asked
the
minister
daringly
do
people
sometimes
lose
heart
without
any
particular
reason
no
never
i
have
reason
though
said
diana
i
see
that
you
do
not
know
said
diana
facing
him
with
a
startled
movement
no
i
know
nothing
miss
diana
i
guess
she
sat
with
her
face
turned
from
him
for
a
while
then
perhaps
reminded
by
the
blast
of
wind
and
snow
which
at
the
moment
came
round
the
house
furiously
and
beat
on
the
windows
she
went
on
hastily
you
wonder
to
see
me
here
but
i
ran
away
from
home
and
i
ca
bear
to
go
back
why
masters
mother
wants
me
to
diana
hesitated
marry
a
rich
man
the
minister
was
silent
he
is
there
all
the
while
i
mean
very
often
he
has
not
spoken
out
yet
but
mother
has
and
she
favours
him
all
she
can
you
do
not
i
wish
i
could
never
see
him
again
sighed
diana
you
can
send
him
away
i
should
think
i
ca
till
he
asks
my
leave
to
stay
and
i
am
so
tired
he
came
to
take
me
to
church
this
morning
and
i
ran
away
before
it
was
time
to
go
you
can
not
be
disposed
of
against
your
will
miss
diana
i
seem
to
have
so
little
will
now
sometimes
i
am
almost
ready
to
be
afraid
mother
and
he
together
will
tire
me
out
nothing
seems
to
matter
any
more
that
would
be
a
great
mistake
yes
said
diana
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
looking
out
towards
the
storm
with
a
despairing
face
people
make
mistakes
sometimes
masters
you
must
think
me
very
strange
but
i
trust
you
and
i
wanted
help
so
much
and
i
have
not
given
you
any
you
would
if
you
could
and
i
will
if
i
can
i
have
thought
of
more
than
i
have
spoken
when
can
i
see
you
again
to
consult
further
it
must
be
alone
i
do
know
this
is
my
chance
tell
me
now
what
have
you
thought
of
i
never
speak
about
business
on
sunday
said
the
minister
meeting
diana
frank
eyes
with
a
slight
smile
which
was
very
far
from
merriment
is
this
business
partly
of
that
character
i
do
know
then
said
diana
we
must
take
our
chance
thank
you
mr
masters
may
i
ask
what
for
for
your
kindness
i
should
like
to
be
kind
to
you
said
he
now
the
present
practical
question
which
can
not
be
put
off
miss
diana
is
how
are
you
going
to
get
home
and
you
that
is
a
secondary
matter
and
easily
disposed
of
i
live
comparatively
near
by
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
drive
three
miles
in
this
storm
both
stood
and
listened
to
the
blast
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
no
denying
the
truth
of
his
words
in
fact
it
would
be
a
doubtful
thing
for
a
strong
man
to
venture
himself
and
his
beast
out
in
the
fury
of
the
whirling
wind
and
snow
for
a
woman
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
masters
considered
for
him
to
take
diana
supposing
the
storm
would
let
him
to
the
house
of
some
near
neighbour
would
be
awkward
enough
and
give
rise
to
endless
and
boundless
town
talk
to
carry
her
home
three
miles
was
as
he
had
said
out
of
the
question
to
wait
both
of
them
in
the
church
for
the
storm
abating
was
again
not
a
desirable
measure
and
would
furnish
even
richer
food
for
the
tongues
of
the
parish
than
the
other
alternatives
would
to
leave
her
or
for
her
to
leave
him
were
alike
impossible
masters
was
not
a
man
who
usually
hesitated
long
about
any
course
of
action
but
he
was
puzzled
he
walked
up
and
down
in
one
of
the
aisles
thinking
while
diana
resumed
her
seat
by
the
stove
her
simplicity
and
independence
of
character
did
not
allow
her
to
greatly
care
about
the
matter
though
she
too
knew
very
well
what
disagreeable
things
would
be
said
at
home
and
elsewhere
and
what
a
handle
would
be
made
of
the
affair
both
against
her
and
against
the
minister
for
his
sake
she
was
sorry
for
herself
what
did
anything
much
matter
this
storm
was
an
exceptional
one
such
as
comes
once
in
a
year
perhaps
or
perhaps
not
in
several
years
the
wind
had
risen
to
a
tempest
the
snow
drove
thick
before
it
whirling
in
the
eddies
of
the
gust
so
as
to
come
in
every
possible
direction
and
seemingly
caught
up
again
before
it
could
reach
a
the
fury
of
its
assault
upon
the
church
windows
made
one
thing
at
least
certain
it
would
be
a
mad
proceeding
now
to
venture
out
into
it
for
a
woman
or
a
man
either
and
it
was
very
cold
though
happily
the
stoves
had
been
so
effectually
fired
up
that
the
little
was
still
quite
comfortable
yet
the
minister
walked
and
walked
diana
almost
forgot
him
she
sat
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
the
lull
was
soothing
the
solitude
was
comforting
the
storm
which
put
a
barrier
between
her
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
a
temporary
friend
diana
could
find
it
in
her
heart
to
wish
it
were
more
than
temporary
to
be
out
of
the
old
grooves
of
pain
is
something
until
the
new
ones
are
worn
to
forsake
scenes
and
surroundings
which
know
all
our
secrets
is
sometimes
to
escape
beneficially
their
persistent
reminders
of
everything
one
would
like
to
forget
diana
felt
like
a
child
that
has
run
away
from
school
and
so
for
the
present
got
rid
of
its
lessons
and
sat
in
a
quiet
sort
of
dull
content
listening
now
and
then
to
the
roar
of
the
blast
and
hugging
herself
that
she
had
run
away
in
time
half
an
hour
more
and
it
would
have
been
too
late
and
will
and
her
mother
would
have
been
her
companions
for
all
day
how
about
diana
shuddered
and
how
about
all
the
that
stretched
along
in
dreary
perspective
before
her
would
they
also
all
of
them
hold
nothing
but
those
same
two
persons
nothing
but
an
endless
vista
of
and
on
one
hand
and
scented
with
cloves
on
the
other
it
would
be
better
far
to
die
if
she
could
die
but
diana
knew
she
could
not
well
said
the
voice
of
the
minister
suddenly
beside
her
what
do
you
think
of
the
prospect
diana
eyes
as
they
were
lifted
to
his
face
were
full
of
so
blank
a
that
his
own
face
changed
and
a
cloud
came
over
its
brightness
we
ca
get
away
he
said
not
at
present
unless
we
were
gulls
and
gulls
never
fly
in
these
regions
do
you
mind
waiting
i
do
not
mind
it
at
all
said
diana
except
for
you
i
am
sorry
for
you
to
have
to
stay
here
with
me
there
is
anybody
i
would
rather
stay
with
said
the
minister
half
humourously
now
can
you
return
the
compliment
yes
indeed
said
diana
earnestly
there
is
anybody
else
i
would
half
as
lieve
stay
with
apparently
you
have
some
confidence
in
me
he
said
in
the
same
tone
i
have
confidence
in
nobody
else
said
diana
sadly
i
know
you
would
help
me
if
you
could
they
were
silent
a
few
minutes
after
that
and
when
masters
began
to
speak
again
it
was
in
a
different
tone
a
gentle
grave
tone
of
business
i
have
been
doing
some
hard
thinking
he
said
while
i
have
been
walking
yonder
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
present
is
an
exceptional
case
and
an
exceptional
time
ordinarily
i
do
not
let
business
private
business
come
into
sunday
but
we
are
brought
here
together
and
detained
here
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
the
business
i
ought
to
do
i
have
only
one
parishioner
on
my
hands
he
went
on
with
a
slight
smile
and
i
may
as
well
attend
to
her
i
am
going
to
tell
you
my
plan
i
shall
not
startle
you
just
now
you
allowed
that
you
had
confidence
in
me
yes
i
will
try
to
do
whatever
you
say
i
ought
to
do
that
i
can
not
tell
said
he
gravely
but
i
will
unfold
to
you
my
plan
you
have
trust
in
me
so
have
i
in
you
diana
but
i
have
more
so
much
more
that
it
would
make
me
happy
to
go
through
my
life
with
you
i
know
he
said
as
he
met
her
startled
look
up
to
him
i
know
you
do
not
love
me
i
know
that
but
you
trust
me
and
i
have
love
enough
for
two
that
has
been
true
a
great
while
suppose
you
come
to
me
and
let
me
take
care
of
you
can
you
trust
me
to
that
extent
diana
lips
had
grown
white
with
fear
and
astonishment
you
do
not
know
she
gasped
but
his
answer
was
steady
and
sweet
i
think
i
do
all
all
i
need
to
know
it
would
be
very
very
wrong
to
you
mr
masters
said
diana
hiding
her
face
no
he
answered
in
the
same
gentle
way
to
give
me
what
i
long
for
but
but
i
have
nothing
to
give
in
return
she
said
answering
not
the
form
of
his
words
but
the
reality
under
them
i
will
take
my
risk
of
that
i
told
you
i
have
enough
for
both
and
i
might
add
to
last
out
our
lives
i
only
want
to
have
the
privilege
of
taking
care
of
you
my
heart
is
dead
cried
diana
piteously
mine
is
and
yours
is
not
it
is
only
sick
but
not
unto
death
and
i
want
to
shelter
and
nurse
it
to
health
again
may
i
you
can
not
said
diana
i
am
not
worth
anybody
looking
at
any
more
there
is
no
life
left
in
me
i
am
not
good
enough
for
you
masters
you
ought
to
have
a
whole
heart
and
a
large
one
in
return
for
your
own
i
do
not
want
any
return
said
he
not
at
present
beyond
that
trust
which
you
so
kindly
have
given
me
and
if
i
never
have
any
more
i
will
be
content
diana
to
be
allowed
to
do
all
the
giving
myself
you
must
spend
your
life
somewhere
can
you
spend
it
anywhere
better
than
at
my
side
no
diana
breathed
rather
than
spoke
it
a
bargain
said
he
taking
her
hand
diana
did
not
withdraw
it
and
stooping
down
he
touched
his
lips
gently
to
hers
this
was
so
unlike
one
of
evan
kisses
that
it
did
not
even
remind
diana
of
them
she
sat
dazed
and
stunned
hardly
knowing
how
she
felt
only
bewildered
yet
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
offered
a
shelter
and
a
lot
which
if
she
had
never
known
evan
she
would
have
esteemed
the
highest
possible
an
empty
lot
now
as
any
one
must
be
an
unequal
exchange
for
masters
an
unfair
transaction
at
the
same
time
for
her
a
from
the
world
buffetings
she
would
escape
so
from
her
mother
exactions
and
rule
from
young
flandin
following
and
pretensions
from
the
pointed
finger
of
gossip
true
that
finger
had
never
been
levelled
at
her
not
yet
but
every
one
who
has
a
secret
sore
spot
knows
the
dread
of
its
being
discovered
and
touched
and
diana
had
never
been
wont
to
mind
her
mother
exactions
or
to
rebel
against
her
rule
but
lately
for
a
year
past
without
knowing
or
guessing
the
wrong
of
which
her
mother
had
been
guilty
diana
had
been
conscious
of
an
underlying
want
of
harmony
somewhere
she
did
not
know
where
it
was
it
was
in
the
air
for
nature
subtle
sympathies
find
their
way
and
know
their
ground
far
beyond
the
sphere
of
sense
or
reason
something
adverse
and
something
sinister
she
had
vaguely
felt
in
her
mother
manner
without
having
the
least
clue
to
any
possible
cause
or
motive
suspicion
was
the
last
thing
to
occur
to
nature
so
she
suspected
nothing
nevertheless
felt
the
grating
and
now
and
then
the
jar
of
their
two
spirits
one
against
the
other
it
was
dimly
connected
with
evan
too
in
her
mind
without
knowing
why
she
thought
blaming
herself
for
the
thought
that
starling
would
not
have
been
so
determinately
eager
to
get
her
married
to
will
flandin
if
evan
knowlton
had
never
been
thought
to
fancy
her
this
was
a
perfectly
unreasoning
conclusion
in
diana
mind
she
could
give
no
account
of
it
but
as
little
could
she
get
rid
of
it
and
it
made
her
ways
lately
hard
to
bear
the
minister
she
knew
instinctively
would
not
let
a
rough
wind
blow
on
her
face
at
his
side
neither
criticism
nor
any
sort
of
human
annoyance
could
reach
her
she
would
have
only
her
own
deep
to
bear
on
to
the
end
but
what
sort
of
justice
was
this
towards
him
diana
lifted
her
head
which
had
been
sunk
in
musing
and
looked
round
she
had
heard
nothing
for
a
while
now
the
swirl
and
rush
of
the
storm
were
the
first
thing
that
struck
her
senses
and
the
first
thought
that
no
getting
away
was
possible
yet
then
she
glanced
at
masters
he
was
there
near
her
just
as
usual
looking
at
her
quietly
masters
she
burst
forth
you
are
very
good
that
is
right
he
said
with
a
sort
of
dry
comicality
which
belonged
to
him
i
hope
you
will
never
change
your
opinion
but
said
diana
withdrawing
her
eyes
in
some
confusion
i
think
i
am
not
i
think
i
am
doing
wrong
in
what
in
letting
you
say
what
you
said
a
little
while
ago
you
have
a
heart
and
a
big
one
i
have
not
any
heart
at
all
i
ca
give
you
what
you
would
give
me
i
have
got
it
to
give
i
never
shall
have
anything
to
give
the
case
being
so
as
you
put
it
said
the
minister
quite
quietly
what
then
you
can
not
change
the
facts
i
can
not
take
back
what
i
have
given
it
was
given
long
ago
diana
and
remains
yours
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
let
me
have
what
is
left
of
you
and
take
care
of
it
while
i
live
i
will
do
that
and
ask
no
reward
you
will
get
tired
of
it
said
diana
with
her
lip
trembling
will
i
said
he
taking
her
hand
and
he
added
no
more
but
through
the
gentle
almost
careless
intonation
diana
felt
and
knew
the
very
truth
that
he
never
would
she
left
her
hand
in
his
clasp
that
too
was
gentle
and
firm
like
the
man
he
seemed
a
tower
of
strength
to
diana
if
only
she
could
have
loved
him
yet
she
thought
she
was
glad
that
he
loved
her
he
was
something
to
lean
upon
some
one
who
would
be
able
to
give
help
they
sat
so
hand
in
hand
for
a
while
the
storm
roaring
against
the
windows
and
howling
round
the
building
do
you
think
the
minister
began
again
with
a
tender
light
accent
it
will
be
part
of
my
permanent
duty
to
preach
to
you
i
dare
say
i
am
sure
i
want
it
enough
said
diana
is
not
this
a
good
opportunity
i
suppose
it
is
we
can
not
get
away
never
mind
the
wind
will
go
down
by
and
by
it
has
been
blowing
on
purpose
to
keep
us
here
diana
do
you
think
a
good
god
made
any
of
his
creatures
to
be
unhappy
i
do
know
masters
he
lets
them
be
unhappy
it
is
not
his
will
but
he
takes
away
what
would
make
them
happy
what
do
you
think
would
do
that
i
suppose
it
is
one
thing
with
one
person
and
another
with
another
true
but
take
an
instance
it
is
mother
happiness
to
have
her
farm
and
her
dairy
and
her
house
go
just
right
is
she
happy
if
it
does
she
is
very
uncomfortable
if
it
do
that
is
not
my
question
said
the
minister
smiling
happiness
is
not
a
thing
that
comes
and
goes
with
the
weather
or
the
crops
or
the
state
of
the
market
nor
even
with
the
life
and
death
and
affection
of
those
we
love
i
thought
it
did
said
diana
rather
faintly
in
that
case
it
would
be
a
changeable
insecure
thing
and
being
that
it
would
cease
to
be
happiness
yes
i
thought
human
happiness
was
changeable
and
uncertain
do
you
not
feel
that
such
conditions
would
spoil
it
no
god
loves
us
better
than
that
but
masters
said
diana
in
some
surprise
nobody
in
this
world
can
be
sure
of
keeping
what
he
likes
except
one
thing
what
can
that
be
did
you
never
see
anybody
who
was
happy
independent
of
circumstances
diana
reflected
i
think
mother
bartlett
is
i
think
so
too
but
she
is
the
only
person
of
whom
that
is
true
in
all
pleasant
valley
how
comes
she
to
be
an
exception
diana
reflected
again
but
this
time
without
finding
an
answer
is
it
that
she
has
set
her
heart
on
what
can
not
fail
her
nor
be
insufficient
for
her
religion
you
mean
i
do
not
mean
religion
what
then
diana
asked
in
new
surprise
i
mean
christ
but
is
that
the
same
thing
not
exactly
christ
is
a
person
yes
but
and
it
is
that
can
make
happy
those
who
know
him
do
you
remember
he
said
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
thirst
looking
up
at
the
speaker
and
following
his
words
they
somehow
struck
diana
rather
hard
her
lip
suddenly
trembled
and
she
looked
down
you
do
not
understand
it
said
the
minister
but
you
must
believe
it
poor
hungry
lamb
seeking
pasture
where
there
is
none
where
it
is
withered
come
to
christ
do
you
mean
said
diana
struggling
for
voice
and
but
unable
to
look
up
for
the
minister
hand
was
on
her
shoulder
and
his
words
had
been
very
tenderly
spoken
do
you
mean
that
when
everything
withered
he
can
make
it
green
again
the
minister
answered
in
the
words
of
david
which
were
the
words
of
the
lord
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning
when
the
sun
riseth
even
a
morning
without
clouds
as
the
tender
grass
springeth
out
of
the
earth
by
clear
shining
after
rain
diana
bent
her
head
lower
could
such
refreshment
and
renewal
of
her
own
wasted
nature
ever
come
to
pass
she
did
not
believe
it
yet
perhaps
there
was
life
yet
at
the
roots
of
the
grass
which
scented
the
rain
the
words
swept
over
as
the
breath
of
the
south
wind
light
of
a
morning
without
clouds
she
repeated
when
she
could
speak
christ
is
all
that
to
those
who
know
him
the
minister
said
then
i
do
not
know
him
said
diana
did
you
think
you
did
but
how
one
know
him
mr
masters
there
is
only
one
way
it
is
said
who
created
the
light
out
of
darkness
hath
in
our
to
give
the
light
of
the
glory
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
how
i
can
not
tell
as
the
sun
rises
over
the
hills
and
suddenly
the
gold
of
it
is
upon
everything
and
the
warmth
of
it
when
i
do
know
that
either
said
masters
gently
touching
brow
as
one
touches
a
child
with
caressing
fingers
says
shall
find
me
when
ye
shall
search
for
me
with
all
your
heart
thou
criest
after
knowledge
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding
if
thou
seekest
her
as
silver
and
searchest
for
her
as
for
hid
treasures
then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
the
knowledge
of
diana
sat
still
awhile
and
neither
of
them
spoke
then
she
said
speaking
more
lightly
i
think
you
have
preached
a
beautiful
sermon
mr
masters
it
a
beautiful
sermon
assented
the
minister
but
how
much
effect
will
it
have
i
do
know
said
diana
i
do
seem
to
have
energy
enough
to
take
hold
of
anything
then
after
a
little
she
added
but
if
anybody
can
help
me
i
am
sure
it
is
you
we
will
stand
by
one
another
then
said
he
and
do
the
best
we
can
diana
did
not
make
any
denial
of
this
conclusion
and
they
sat
still
without
more
words
for
some
time
each
busied
with
his
own
separate
train
of
musings
then
diana
felt
a
little
shiver
of
cold
beginning
to
creep
over
her
and
masters
roused
himself
this
is
getting
serious
said
he
looking
at
his
watch
what
do
you
think
it
is
one
and
after
am
i
to
make
up
the
fires
again
we
can
not
stir
at
present
neither
it
was
found
could
he
make
up
the
fires
for
the
coal
bin
was
in
the
cellar
or
underground
vault
to
which
the
entrance
was
from
the
outside
and
looking
from
the
window
masters
saw
that
the
snow
had
drifted
on
that
side
to
the
height
of
a
man
covering
the
low
door
entirely
hours
of
labour
would
be
required
to
clear
away
the
snow
enough
to
give
access
to
the
coal
and
the
minister
had
not
even
a
shovel
at
the
same
time
the
fires
were
going
down
and
the
room
was
beginning
to
get
chilly
under
the
power
of
the
searching
wind
which
found
its
way
in
by
many
entrances
the
only
resource
was
to
walk
masters
gave
diana
his
arm
and
she
accepted
it
and
together
they
paced
up
and
down
the
aisle
it
was
a
strange
walk
to
diana
her
companion
was
rather
silent
speaking
only
a
few
words
now
and
then
and
it
occurred
to
her
to
wonder
whether
this
her
first
walk
with
him
was
to
be
a
likeness
of
the
whole
a
progress
through
chilly
and
empty
space
diana
was
not
what
may
be
called
an
imaginative
person
but
a
thought
of
this
kind
came
over
her
it
did
not
make
her
change
her
mind
at
all
respecting
the
agreement
she
had
entered
into
if
it
were
to
be
so
better
she
should
find
herself
at
his
side
she
thought
than
anywhere
else
she
was
even
glad
in
a
dull
sort
of
way
that
masters
should
be
pleased
pleasure
for
her
was
gone
out
of
the
world
honour
him
she
could
and
did
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
but
that
was
all
it
was
well
perhaps
for
her
composure
that
whatever
pleasure
her
companion
might
feel
in
their
new
relations
he
did
not
make
the
feeling
obtrusively
prominent
he
was
just
his
usual
self
with
a
slight
confidence
in
his
manner
to
her
which
had
not
appeared
before
so
they
walked
diana
said
masters
suddenly
have
you
brought
no
lunch
with
you
i
forgot
it
at
least
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
house
without
being
seen
i
did
care
about
anything
else
if
i
had
gone
to
the
pantry
they
would
have
found
out
what
i
was
doing
and
i
brought
nothing
of
all
days
i
am
sorry
for
your
sake
i
do
mind
it
said
diana
i
do
feel
it
nor
i
but
that
proves
nothing
this
wo
do
it
is
two
we
get
away
it
will
be
growing
dark
in
a
little
while
more
the
days
are
just
at
the
shortest
i
think
the
storm
is
quite
so
bad
as
it
was
said
diana
they
stood
still
and
listened
it
beat
and
blew
and
the
snow
came
thick
still
the
exceeding
fury
of
the
blast
seemed
to
be
lessened
we
give
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
said
the
minister
diana
we
have
had
preaching
but
we
have
had
no
praying
she
assented
submissively
to
his
look
as
well
as
his
words
and
they
knelt
down
together
in
the
chancel
masters
prayed
not
very
long
but
a
prayer
full
of
the
sweetness
and
the
confidence
and
the
strength
of
a
child
of
god
who
is
at
home
in
his
father
presence
full
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
for
her
diana
mind
went
through
a
series
of
experiences
in
the
course
of
that
short
prayer
the
sweetness
and
the
confidence
of
it
touched
her
first
with
the
sense
of
contrast
and
wrung
tears
from
her
that
were
bitter
then
the
speaker
got
beyond
her
depth
into
regions
of
feeling
where
she
could
not
follow
him
nor
quite
understand
but
that
she
knew
was
only
because
he
was
at
home
where
she
was
so
much
a
stranger
and
her
thoughts
made
a
leap
to
the
admiration
of
and
then
to
the
useless
consideration
how
happy
she
might
have
been
with
this
man
had
not
evan
come
between
why
had
he
come
just
to
win
her
and
prove
himself
unworthy
of
her
but
it
was
done
and
not
to
be
undone
evan
had
her
heart
worthy
or
unworthy
she
could
not
take
it
back
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
but
to
be
a
cold
shadow
walking
beside
this
good
man
who
was
so
full
of
all
gentle
and
noble
affections
well
she
was
glad
since
he
wanted
her
that
she
might
lead
her
colourless
existence
by
his
side
that
was
the
last
feeling
with
which
she
rose
from
her
knees
chapter
xx
settled
it
was
a
very
wild
storm
yet
through
which
masters
drove
diana
home
still
the
wind
blew
hard
and
the
snow
came
driving
and
beating
down
upon
their
shoulders
and
faces
in
thick
white
masses
and
the
drifts
had
piled
up
in
some
places
very
high
more
than
once
the
sleigh
prince
and
all
was
near
being
lodged
in
a
from
which
the
getting
free
would
have
been
a
work
of
time
masters
had
to
get
out
and
do
some
rather
complicated
engineering
and
withal
through
the
thick
and
heavy
snowfall
it
was
difficult
to
see
what
they
were
coming
to
patience
and
coolness
and
good
driving
got
the
better
of
dangers
however
and
slowly
the
way
was
put
behind
them
they
met
nobody
masters
said
diana
suddenly
you
will
have
to
stay
at
our
house
you
can
never
get
back
i
do
believe
starling
will
let
me
go
said
the
minister
diana
did
not
know
exactly
how
to
understand
this
it
struck
a
sort
of
chill
to
her
that
he
was
intending
at
once
to
proclaim
their
new
relations
to
each
other
yet
she
could
find
nothing
to
object
and
indeed
she
did
not
wish
to
object
mother
will
not
be
pleased
she
ventured
after
a
pause
no
i
do
not
expect
it
we
have
got
to
face
that
but
she
is
a
wise
woman
and
will
know
how
to
accommodate
herself
to
things
when
she
knows
she
ca
help
it
i
will
put
prince
up
and
give
him
some
supper
and
then
we
will
see
diana
accordingly
went
in
alone
but
as
it
happened
starling
was
busied
with
some
affairs
in
the
outer
kitchen
and
diana
passed
through
and
got
up
to
her
own
room
without
any
encounter
she
was
glad
encounters
were
not
in
her
line
she
was
somewhat
leisurely
therefore
in
taking
off
her
wrappings
and
changing
her
dress
and
as
the
minister
was
on
the
other
hand
as
soon
done
with
his
ministrations
to
prince
as
circumstances
and
the
snow
permitted
it
fell
out
that
they
the
kitchen
almost
at
the
same
moment
though
by
different
doors
it
was
the
kitchen
the
only
place
where
fire
was
kept
on
sunday
and
indeed
that
was
the
usual
winter
a
little
outer
kitchen
serving
for
all
the
dirty
work
it
was
in
what
i
should
call
dreary
sunday
order
which
means
order
without
life
the
very
chairs
and
tables
seemed
to
say
forlornly
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
not
so
much
as
an
open
book
proclaimed
that
the
mistress
of
the
place
was
any
better
off
however
she
had
other
resources
for
even
as
the
minister
came
in
from
the
snow
and
diana
from
starling
herself
made
her
appearance
from
the
outer
kitchen
with
a
pan
of
potatoes
in
her
hand
starling
liked
neither
to
be
surprised
nor
to
seem
so
moreover
from
the
outer
kitchen
door
she
had
seen
prince
and
the
sleigh
going
to
the
barn
and
seen
too
who
was
driving
him
with
the
cunning
of
an
indian
she
had
made
a
sudden
tremendous
leap
to
conclusions
how
arrived
at
i
can
not
say
there
is
a
faculty
in
some
natures
that
is
very
like
a
power
of
intuition
so
she
came
in
now
with
a
manner
that
was
undeclarative
of
anything
but
grimness
gave
no
sign
of
either
surprise
or
curiosity
vouchsafed
the
minister
only
a
scant
little
nod
of
welcome
and
to
diana
scarce
a
look
and
set
her
pan
of
potatoes
on
the
table
while
she
went
into
the
pantry
for
a
knife
do
you
want
those
peeled
mother
diana
asked
must
have
something
for
supper
i
suppose
shall
i
do
it
no
i
guess
you
done
enough
for
one
day
have
said
masters
and
if
you
had
driven
these
three
miles
in
the
snow
you
would
know
it
may
i
have
some
supper
mrs
starling
there
be
enough
i
guess
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
with
her
knife
flying
round
the
potato
in
hand
in
a
way
that
showed
both
practice
and
energy
then
presently
with
a
scarce
perceptible
glance
up
at
her
daughter
she
added
where
have
you
been
to
church
mother
to
church
scornfully
what
did
you
do
there
she
heard
preaching
said
the
minister
in
that
very
quiet
and
composed
way
of
his
which
it
was
difficult
to
fight
against
few
people
ever
tried
if
any
one
could
it
was
starling
i
guess
there
war
many
that
had
the
privilege
she
said
inquiringly
not
many
said
the
minister
i
never
had
a
smaller
audience
in
church
to
preach
to
folks
had
better
be
at
home
such
a
day
and
preach
to
themselves
i
quite
agree
with
you
so
i
brought
diana
back
as
soon
as
i
could
but
we
have
been
two
hours
on
the
way
starling
knife
flew
round
the
potatoes
her
tongue
was
silent
diana
began
to
set
the
table
sitting
by
the
corner
of
the
fire
to
dry
the
wet
spots
on
his
clothes
the
minister
watched
her
and
starling
without
looking
watched
them
both
and
at
last
having
finished
her
potatoes
seized
the
dish
and
went
off
with
it
no
doubt
to
cook
the
supper
for
savoury
fumes
soon
came
stealing
in
diana
made
coffee
not
without
a
strange
back
look
to
a
certain
stormy
september
night
when
she
had
made
it
for
some
one
else
it
was
december
now
a
december
which
no
spring
would
follow
so
what
mattered
anything
coffee
or
the
rest
if
there
were
any
blessing
left
for
her
in
the
world
she
believed
it
would
be
under
masters
protection
and
in
his
goodness
she
felt
dull
and
in
a
dream
but
she
believed
that
the
three
had
supper
alone
conversation
as
far
as
starling
was
concerned
went
on
the
pattern
that
has
been
given
masters
was
at
the
whole
expense
of
the
entertainment
mentally
and
he
talked
with
the
ease
and
pleasantness
that
seemed
natural
to
him
of
things
that
could
not
help
interesting
the
others
even
diana
in
her
deadness
of
heart
even
starling
in
her
perversity
pricked
up
their
ears
and
listened
i
do
believe
either
he
even
found
it
a
difficult
effort
nothing
ever
seemed
difficult
to
masters
that
he
had
to
do
it
was
always
done
so
graciously
and
as
if
he
were
enjoying
it
himself
so
no
doubt
he
was
certainly
this
evening
though
starling
did
not
speak
many
words
and
diana
spoke
none
so
supper
was
finished
and
the
mistress
and
her
guest
moved
their
chairs
to
the
fire
while
diana
busied
herself
in
putting
up
the
things
going
in
and
out
from
the
pantry
you
have
to
keep
me
starling
said
the
minister
i
knew
that
when
i
saw
you
come
in
responded
the
lady
not
over
graciously
i
am
not
going
to
receive
hospitality
under
false
pretences
though
said
the
minister
if
i
rob
i
wo
steal
starling
diana
and
i
have
come
to
an
agreement
i
knew
that
too
returned
the
lady
defiantly
according
to
which
agreement
pursued
the
other
without
change
of
a
hair
i
am
coming
again
some
other
time
to
take
her
away
out
of
your
care
into
mine
there
go
two
words
to
that
bargain
said
starling
after
a
pause
two
words
have
been
spoken
mine
and
hers
now
we
want
yours
diana
got
to
take
care
of
me
does
that
mean
that
she
is
never
to
marry
it
do
mean
anything
ridiculous
said
starling
so
it
mean
that
i
should
not
like
to
say
anything
ridiculous
then
if
she
may
marry
it
only
remains
that
she
and
you
should
be
suited
do
you
object
to
me
as
a
it
is
impossible
to
convey
the
impression
of
the
manner
winning
half
humourous
half
dry
supremely
careless
and
confident
in
which
all
this
was
said
on
the
minister
part
it
was
something
almost
impossible
at
the
moment
to
withstand
and
it
fidgetted
starling
to
be
under
the
power
of
it
her
grudge
against
the
minister
was
even
increased
by
it
and
yet
she
could
not
give
vent
to
the
feeling
i
not
called
upon
to
make
objections
against
you
in
any
way
she
answered
rather
vaguely
that
means
of
course
that
you
have
no
objections
to
make
i
do
make
any
said
starling
shortly
i
must
be
content
with
that
said
masters
smiling
diana
your
mother
makes
no
objections
and
rising
he
went
and
gravely
kissed
her
i
do
not
know
what
tied
starling
tongue
she
sat
before
the
fire
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
in
an
inward
fury
of
dull
displeasure
she
had
untold
objections
to
this
arrangement
and
yet
though
she
knew
she
must
speak
now
or
never
she
could
not
speak
whether
it
were
the
spell
of
the
minister
manner
which
as
i
said
worked
its
charm
upon
her
as
it
did
upon
others
whether
it
were
the
prick
of
conscience
warning
her
that
she
had
interfered
once
too
often
already
in
her
life
affairs
or
whether
finally
she
had
an
instinctive
sense
that
things
were
gone
too
far
for
her
hindering
hand
she
fumed
in
secret
and
did
nothing
she
was
a
woman
of
sense
she
knew
that
if
a
man
like
masters
loved
her
daughter
and
had
got
her
daughter
it
would
be
an
ill
waste
of
strength
on
her
part
to
try
to
break
the
arrangement
it
might
be
done
but
it
would
not
be
worth
the
scandal
and
the
confusion
and
she
was
not
sure
that
it
could
be
done
so
she
sat
chewing
the
cud
of
her
mortification
and
ire
giving
little
heed
to
what
words
passed
between
the
others
it
had
come
to
this
she
had
schemed
she
had
put
a
violent
hand
upon
diana
fate
to
turn
it
her
own
way
and
now
was
the
way
it
had
gone
all
her
wrong
deeds
for
nothing
she
had
purposed
as
she
said
that
diana
should
take
care
of
her
therefore
diana
should
not
marry
any
poor
and
proud
young
officer
nor
any
officer
at
all
to
carry
her
away
beyond
reach
and
into
a
sphere
beyond
and
above
the
sphere
of
her
mother
no
diana
must
marry
a
rich
young
farmer
will
flandin
would
just
do
a
man
who
would
not
dislike
or
be
anywise
averse
to
receive
such
a
into
his
house
but
reckon
it
an
added
advantage
then
her
home
would
be
secure
and
her
continued
rule
and
ruling
was
as
necessary
to
starling
as
eating
she
would
have
a
larger
house
and
business
to
manage
and
withal
need
not
do
herself
more
than
she
chose
having
diana
she
would
be
sure
of
everything
else
she
wanted
now
she
had
lost
diana
and
only
to
a
poor
parson
when
all
was
done
would
it
have
been
better
to
let
her
marry
the
officer
for
starling
had
a
shrewd
guess
that
such
would
have
been
the
issue
of
things
if
she
had
let
them
alone
diana
could
not
so
have
been
more
out
of
her
power
or
out
of
her
sphere
for
starling
had
a
certain
assured
consciousness
that
she
would
not
fit
in
the
minister
family
and
that
gentle
as
he
was
he
would
rule
his
house
and
his
wife
himself
she
sat
brooding
hardly
hearing
what
was
said
by
either
of
the
others
and
indeed
the
discourse
was
not
very
lively
till
masters
rose
and
bade
them
good
night
and
then
starling
still
went
on
musing
why
had
she
not
interfered
at
the
right
moment
to
put
a
stop
to
this
affair
she
had
let
the
moment
go
and
the
thought
vexed
her
and
her
mood
was
not
at
all
sweetened
by
the
lurking
doubt
whether
she
could
have
stopped
it
if
she
had
tried
starling
could
not
abide
to
meet
with
her
match
and
sorely
hated
her
match
when
she
found
it
what
if
she
were
to
tell
diana
of
those
letters
of
evan
but
then
diana
would
be
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
with
better
keep
her
in
the
village
perhaps
starling
grew
more
and
more
impatient
diana
you
are
a
big
fool
she
burst
out
diana
at
that
moment
thought
she
did
not
answer
both
were
sitting
before
the
wide
fireplace
and
diana
had
not
moved
since
masters
left
them
what
sort
of
a
life
do
you
expect
you
are
going
to
have
i
do
know
mother
you
who
might
marry
the
richest
man
in
town
and
live
in
plenty
and
have
just
your
own
way
and
everything
you
want
you
a
fool
i
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
a
poor
minister
wife
i
shall
know
i
suppose
that
is
if
masters
is
poor
i
do
know
whether
he
is
or
not
he
is
of
course
they
all
are
well
mother
you
have
taught
me
how
to
keep
house
on
a
little
yes
you
and
me
that
one
thing
it
another
thing
when
you
have
a
shiftless
man
hanging
round
and
a
dozen
children
or
so
and
expected
to
be
civil
to
all
the
world
they
always
have
a
house
full
of
children
and
they
are
all
shiftless
who
mother
poor
ministers
father
had
and
was
he
was
as
shiftless
a
man
as
ever
wore
he
was
a
bit
of
help
to
a
woman
all
he
cared
for
was
to
lose
his
time
in
his
books
and
that
the
way
this
man
do
and
leave
you
to
take
the
brunt
of
everything
time
go
in
cookin
and
mendin
and
washin
up
and
you
have
to
be
at
everybody
beck
and
call
at
the
end
o
that
if
there
anything
hate
it
to
be
in
the
kitchen
and
parlour
both
at
the
same
time
diana
was
silent
you
might
have
lived
like
a
queen
i
do
want
to
live
like
a
queen
you
might
have
had
your
own
way
diana
i
do
care
about
having
my
own
way
i
wish
you
would
care
then
or
had
a
speck
of
spirit
what
life
good
for
i
wish
i
knew
said
diana
wearily
as
she
rose
and
set
back
her
chair
you
never
will
know
in
that
man
house
i
do
think
ministers
are
the
meanest
lot
o
folks
there
is
and
that
you
should
go
and
take
one
of
them
it
is
the
other
way
mother
he
has
taken
me
said
diana
half
laughing
at
what
seemed
to
her
the
disproportion
between
her
passion
and
the
occasion
for
it
you
were
a
fool
to
let
him
i
do
think
so
you
be
sorry
yet
why
they
a
shiftless
lot
said
starling
rather
evasively
the
whole
of
and
this
one
has
a
way
of
holding
his
own
in
other
houses
that
is
intolerable
to
me
i
never
liked
him
not
from
the
very
first
i
always
liked
him
said
diana
simply
and
she
went
off
to
her
room
she
had
not
expected
that
her
mother
would
favour
the
arrangement
on
the
contrary
and
it
had
all
been
settled
much
more
easily
than
she
had
looked
for
chapter
xxi
unsettled
so
things
were
settled
and
starling
made
no
attempt
to
unsettle
them
on
the
other
hand
she
fell
into
a
condition
of
permanent
unrest
which
i
do
not
know
how
to
characterize
it
was
not
exactly
it
was
not
displeasure
or
if
it
was
displeasure
at
herself
but
it
was
contrary
to
all
starling
principles
to
admit
that
and
she
never
admitted
it
her
farm
servant
josh
described
her
as
being
always
now
in
an
aggravated
state
and
diana
found
her
society
very
uncomfortable
there
was
never
a
word
spoken
pleasantly
by
any
chance
about
anything
good
was
not
commended
and
ill
was
not
deplored
but
both
good
and
ill
were
taken
up
in
the
same
sharp
acrid
cynical
tone
or
treated
with
the
like
restless
mockery
starling
found
no
fault
with
diana
other
than
by
this
bitter
manner
of
handling
every
subject
that
came
up
at
the
same
time
she
made
the
little
house
where
they
lived
together
a
place
of
thunderous
atmosphere
where
it
was
impossible
to
draw
breath
freely
and
peacefully
they
were
very
much
shut
up
to
one
another
too
that
sunday
storm
in
december
had
been
followed
by
successive
falls
of
snow
so
deep
that
the
ways
were
encumbered
and
travelling
more
difficult
than
usual
in
pleasant
valley
even
in
winter
there
was
very
little
getting
about
between
the
neighbours
houses
and
the
people
let
their
social
qualities
wait
for
spring
and
summer
to
develope
themselves
diana
and
her
mother
scarcely
saw
anybody
nick
boddington
at
rare
intervals
looked
in
joe
bartlett
once
or
twice
came
with
a
message
from
his
mother
once
diana
had
gone
down
to
see
her
even
masters
made
his
appearance
at
the
little
brown
less
frequently
than
might
have
been
supposed
for
in
truth
starling
presence
made
his
visits
rather
unsatisfactory
and
besides
the
two
kitchen
fires
there
was
none
other
in
the
house
to
which
diana
and
he
could
withdraw
and
see
each
other
alone
so
he
came
only
now
and
then
and
generally
did
not
stay
very
long
to
diana
all
this
while
the
coming
or
the
going
the
solitude
or
the
company
even
the
good
or
ill
humours
of
her
mother
seemed
to
be
of
little
importance
she
lived
her
own
deadened
secret
life
through
it
all
and
had
no
nerves
of
sensation
near
enough
to
the
surface
to
be
affected
much
by
what
went
on
outside
of
her
what
though
her
mother
was
all
the
while
in
a
rasped
sort
of
state
it
could
not
rasp
diana
she
seemed
to
wear
a
coat
of
mail
neighbours
no
neighbours
were
anything
to
her
one
way
or
another
if
she
could
be
said
to
like
anything
it
was
to
be
quite
alone
and
see
and
hear
nobody
her
marriage
she
looked
at
in
the
same
dull
way
with
a
thought
so
far
as
she
gave
it
a
thought
that
in
the
minister
house
her
life
would
be
more
quiet
and
peace
and
would
replace
the
eager
disquiet
around
her
which
without
minding
it
diana
yet
perceived
more
quiet
and
better
she
hoped
her
life
would
be
her
life
and
herself
she
thought
the
minister
was
getting
a
bad
bargain
of
it
but
since
it
was
his
pleasure
she
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
for
her
every
time
she
met
the
gentle
kind
eyes
and
felt
the
warm
clasp
of
his
hand
diana
repeated
the
assurance
to
herself
the
girl
had
sunk
again
into
mental
torpor
she
did
not
see
nor
hear
nor
feel
she
lived
along
a
mechanical
sort
of
life
having
relapsed
into
her
former
stunned
condition
not
crushed
there
was
too
much
of
diana
nature
for
one
blow
or
perhaps
many
blows
to
effect
that
not
beaten
down
like
some
other
characters
she
went
on
her
way
upright
alert
and
strong
doing
and
expecting
to
do
the
work
of
life
to
its
utmost
measure
all
the
same
walking
as
a
ghost
might
walk
through
the
scenes
of
his
former
existence
with
no
longer
any
natural
conditions
to
put
her
at
one
with
them
and
only
conscious
of
her
dead
heart
this
state
of
things
had
given
way
in
the
fall
to
a
few
months
of
incessant
and
very
live
pain
with
her
betrothal
to
the
minister
diana
had
sunk
again
into
the
dulness
of
apathy
but
with
a
constitution
mental
and
physical
like
hers
so
full
of
sound
so
true
and
strong
in
the
nature
of
things
this
state
of
apathetic
sleep
could
not
last
for
ever
and
the
time
of
final
waking
came
the
winter
had
dragged
its
length
away
spring
had
come
with
its
renewal
of
all
the
farm
and
household
activities
diana
stood
up
to
her
work
and
did
it
day
by
day
with
faultless
accuracy
with
blameless
diligence
she
was
too
useful
a
helper
not
to
be
missed
unwillingly
from
any
household
that
had
once
known
her
and
starling
temper
did
not
improve
it
had
been
arranged
that
diana
marriage
should
take
place
about
the
first
of
june
spring
work
over
and
summer
going
on
its
orderly
way
she
could
be
easiest
spared
then
she
thought
and
starling
seeing
it
must
be
made
no
particular
objection
beyond
the
time
nothing
had
been
talked
of
yet
concerning
the
occasion
so
it
was
a
hitherto
untouched
question
when
starling
asked
her
daughter
one
day
what
sort
of
a
wedding
are
you
calculatin
to
have
what
sort
of
a
wedding
i
do
know
said
diana
what
do
you
mean
by
a
wedding
the
thing
is
what
mean
by
it
do
be
a
baby
diana
starling
do
you
mean
to
ask
your
friends
to
see
you
married
i
do
want
anybody
i
am
sure
said
diana
and
i
am
sure
masters
does
not
care
are
you
going
to
be
married
in
a
black
gown
black
no
but
i
do
not
care
what
kind
of
a
gown
it
is
further
than
that
i
do
think
you
care
much
about
the
whole
thing
said
starling
looking
at
her
if
i
was
you
i
would
be
married
just
to
please
somebody
else
without
it
pleased
myself
too
that
what
think
poor
diana
thought
of
masters
face
as
she
had
seen
it
the
last
time
and
it
seemed
to
her
good
to
give
somebody
else
pleasure
even
if
pleasure
were
gone
and
out
of
the
question
for
her
this
view
of
the
question
naturally
she
did
not
make
public
what
you
going
to
marry
this
man
for
said
starling
standing
straight
up
she
had
been
bending
over
some
work
and
looking
hard
at
her
daughter
i
hope
he
make
a
good
woman
of
me
diana
said
soberly
if
you
had
a
little
more
spunk
you
might
make
a
good
man
of
him
but
you
are
the
woman
to
do
it
he
wants
his
pride
taken
down
a
bit
but
what
about
the
day
mother
said
diana
who
preferred
not
to
discuss
this
subject
well
if
you
have
thought
of
it
i
have
and
i
going
to
ask
all
the
folks
there
are
and
we
got
to
make
a
spread
for
diana
starling
so
we
may
as
well
be
about
it
already
said
diana
it
weeks
yet
they
run
away
you
find
and
the
cake
be
better
for
keepin
you
may
go
about
stonin
the
fruit
as
soon
as
you
a
mind
to
diana
said
no
more
but
stoned
her
raisins
and
picked
over
her
currants
and
sliced
her
citron
with
the
same
apathetic
want
of
realization
which
lately
she
had
brought
to
everything
it
might
have
been
cake
for
anybody
else
wedding
that
she
was
getting
ready
so
little
did
her
fingers
recognise
the
relation
of
the
things
with
herself
the
cake
was
made
and
baked
and
iced
and
ornamented
and
then
activities
went
on
to
other
items
of
preparation
seeing
diana
would
be
married
she
meant
it
should
be
done
in
a
way
the
would
not
forget
neither
should
flandin
make
mental
comparisons
pityingly
of
the
wedding
that
was
with
the
wedding
that
would
have
been
with
her
son
for
the
bridegroom
baking
and
boiling
and
roasting
and
jellying
went
on
in
quantity
for
starling
was
a
great
cook
and
could
do
things
in
style
when
she
chose
the
house
was
put
in
order
fresh
curtains
hung
up
and
the
handsomest
linen
laid
out
and
greens
and
flowers
employed
to
cover
and
deck
the
severely
plain
walls
and
furniture
one
thing
more
starling
wished
for
which
she
was
not
likely
to
have
the
presence
of
one
of
the
elmfield
family
on
the
occasion
she
would
have
liked
some
one
of
them
to
be
there
in
order
that
sure
news
of
the
whole
might
go
to
evan
and
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
for
a
lurking
fear
of
his
sudden
appearing
some
time
had
long
hidden
in
starling
mind
i
do
not
know
what
she
feared
in
such
a
case
of
the
two
evan
was
hardly
more
distasteful
to
her
as
a
than
the
minister
was
though
it
is
true
that
her
action
in
the
matter
of
burning
the
letters
had
made
her
hate
the
man
she
had
injured
this
feeling
was
counterbalanced
i
confess
by
another
feeling
of
the
delight
it
would
be
to
see
masters
nonplussed
but
on
the
whole
she
preferred
that
evan
should
keep
at
a
distance
all
the
work
and
confusion
of
these
last
few
weeks
claimed
diana
full
time
and
strength
as
well
as
her
mother
she
had
scarcely
a
minute
to
think
and
that
was
one
reason
no
doubt
why
she
went
through
them
with
such
unchanged
composure
they
were
all
behind
her
at
last
everything
was
in
order
and
readiness
down
to
the
smallest
particular
and
it
was
with
a
dull
sense
of
this
that
diana
went
up
to
her
room
the
last
night
before
her
wedding
day
it
was
all
done
and
the
time
was
all
gone
she
went
in
slowly
went
to
the
window
opened
it
and
sat
down
before
it
june
had
come
again
one
day
of
june
was
passed
and
would
be
the
second
through
the
bustle
of
may
diana
had
hardly
given
a
look
to
the
weather
or
a
thought
to
the
time
of
year
it
greeted
her
now
at
her
window
like
a
dear
old
friend
that
she
had
been
forgetting
the
moon
about
an
hour
high
gave
a
gentle
illumination
through
the
dewy
air
revealing
plainly
enough
the
level
meadows
and
the
hills
which
made
their
distant
bordering
the
scent
of
roses
and
honeysuckles
was
abroad
just
under
diana
window
there
was
a
honeysuckle
vine
in
full
blossom
and
the
rich
peculiar
fragrance
came
in
puffs
of
air
the
softest
of
breezes
brought
them
stirring
the
little
leaves
lazily
and
just
touched
diana
face
sweet
and
tender
reminding
caressing
reminding
of
what
for
it
began
to
stir
vaguely
and
uneasily
in
diana
heart
things
not
thought
of
before
put
in
a
claim
to
be
looked
at
this
her
home
and
sanctuary
for
so
many
years
it
was
to
be
hers
no
longer
this
was
the
last
night
at
her
window
by
her
honeysuckle
vine
she
would
not
have
another
evening
the
enjoyment
of
her
wonted
favourite
view
over
the
fields
and
hills
she
had
done
with
all
that
other
scenes
another
home
would
claim
her
and
then
slowly
rose
the
thought
that
her
freedom
was
gone
this
was
the
last
time
she
would
belong
to
herself
oddly
enough
nothing
of
all
this
had
come
under
consideration
before
diana
had
been
stunned
she
had
believed
for
a
long
time
that
she
was
dead
mentally
she
had
been
as
it
were
in
a
slumber
partly
of
hopelessness
partly
of
preoccupation
now
the
time
of
waking
had
come
and
the
hidden
life
in
her
stirred
and
rose
and
shivered
with
the
consciousness
that
it
alive
and
in
its
full
strength
and
what
it
meant
for
it
to
be
alive
now
as
i
said
diana
nature
was
too
sound
and
and
strong
for
anything
to
crush
it
or
even
any
part
of
it
and
now
she
knew
that
the
nerves
of
feeling
she
thought
evan
had
killed
for
ever
were
all
astir
and
quivering
and
would
never
be
fooled
into
slumbering
again
i
can
not
tell
how
all
this
dawned
and
broke
to
her
consciousness
she
had
sat
down
at
her
window
a
calm
girl
placid
and
with
even
a
dull
sort
of
content
upon
her
so
she
had
sat
and
dreamed
awhile
and
then
june
and
moonlight
and
her
honeysuckle
and
the
roses
and
the
memory
of
her
free
childish
days
and
the
image
of
her
lost
lover
and
the
thought
of
where
she
was
standing
by
degrees
how
gently
they
did
it
too
roused
her
and
pricked
her
up
to
the
consciousness
of
what
she
going
to
do
what
was
she
going
to
do
marry
a
man
who
had
no
real
place
in
her
heart
she
had
thought
it
did
not
matter
she
had
thought
she
was
dead
now
all
at
once
she
knew
that
she
was
alive
in
every
fibre
and
that
it
mattered
fearfully
the
idea
of
masters
stung
her
not
as
say
almost
to
madness
for
there
was
no
such
irregularity
in
diana
round
sound
healthy
nature
but
to
pain
that
seemed
unbearable
no
confusion
in
her
brain
and
no
dulness
now
on
the
contrary
an
intense
consciousness
of
all
that
her
position
involved
she
had
made
a
mistake
like
many
another
unlike
many
she
had
found
it
out
early
she
was
going
to
marry
a
man
to
whom
she
had
no
love
to
give
and
she
knew
now
that
the
life
she
must
thenceforth
lead
would
be
daily
torture
almost
the
worse
because
she
had
for
masters
so
deep
a
respect
and
so
true
an
appreciation
and
he
loved
her
of
that
there
was
no
question
the
whole
affection
of
the
best
man
she
had
ever
known
was
bestowed
upon
her
and
in
his
hopes
he
saw
doubtless
a
future
when
she
would
have
learnt
to
return
his
love
and
i
never
shall
thought
diana
never
as
long
as
i
live
i
wonder
if
i
shall
get
to
hate
him
because
i
am
obliged
to
live
with
him
all
the
heart
i
have
is
evan
and
will
be
evan
it
do
make
any
difference
that
he
was
not
worthy
of
me
as
i
suppose
he
was
i
have
given
and
i
can
not
take
back
and
now
i
must
live
with
this
other
man
diana
shuddered
already
she
shed
no
tears
happy
are
they
whose
grief
can
flow
part
of
the
oppression
at
least
flows
off
with
tears
if
not
part
of
the
pain
eyes
wide
open
staring
out
into
the
moonlight
a
rigid
face
from
which
the
colour
gradually
ebbed
and
ebbed
away
more
and
more
so
diana
kept
the
watch
of
her
bridal
eve
as
the
moon
got
higher
and
the
world
lay
clearer
revealed
under
its
light
shadows
grew
more
defined
and
objects
more
recognisable
it
seemed
as
if
in
due
proportion
the
life
before
diana
mental
vision
opened
and
displayed
itself
plainer
and
clearer
as
she
saw
one
she
saw
the
other
if
diana
had
been
a
woman
of
the
world
her
strength
of
character
would
have
availed
to
do
what
many
a
woman
of
the
world
has
not
the
force
for
she
would
have
drawn
back
at
the
last
minute
and
declined
to
fulfil
her
engagement
but
in
the
sphere
of
diana
experience
such
a
thing
was
unheard
of
all
the
proprieties
all
the
conditions
of
the
social
life
that
was
known
to
her
forbade
even
the
thought
and
the
thought
never
came
to
her
she
felt
just
as
much
bound
that
is
as
irrecoverably
as
she
would
be
hours
later
but
she
was
like
a
caged
wild
animal
the
view
of
the
sweet
moonlit
country
became
unbearable
at
last
and
she
walked
up
and
down
her
floor
she
had
a
vague
idea
of
tiring
herself
so
that
she
could
sleep
she
did
get
tired
of
walking
but
no
sleep
came
and
at
last
she
sat
down
again
before
her
window
to
watch
another
change
that
was
coming
over
the
landscape
the
moon
was
down
and
a
cool
grey
light
very
unlike
her
soft
glamour
was
stealing
into
the
sky
and
upon
the
world
yes
the
day
was
coming
the
clear
light
of
a
creation
it
was
coming
and
she
must
meet
it
and
march
on
in
the
procession
of
life
which
would
leave
no
one
out
if
she
could
go
alone
but
she
must
walk
by
another
side
now
and
to
that
other
the
light
of
this
grey
dawn
if
he
saw
it
brought
only
thoughts
of
joy
could
she
help
his
being
disappointed
would
she
be
able
to
help
his
finding
out
what
a
dreadful
mistake
he
had
made
and
she
i
thought
diana
and
set
her
teeth
mentally
he
must
not
know
how
i
feel
he
does
not
deserve
that
he
deserves
nothing
but
good
of
me
or
of
anybody
i
will
give
him
all
i
can
and
he
shall
not
know
how
i
do
it
with
a
recoil
in
every
fibre
of
her
nature
diana
turned
to
take
up
her
life
burden
she
felt
as
if
she
had
had
none
till
now
chapter
xxii
new
life
the
first
week
of
diana
marriage
was
always
a
blank
in
her
memory
the
one
continual
intense
strain
of
effort
to
hide
from
her
husband
what
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
swallowed
up
everything
else
masters
had
procured
a
comfortable
little
light
rockaway
and
avoiding
all
public
thoroughfares
and
conveyances
had
driven
off
with
diana
among
the
leafy
wildernesses
of
the
white
mountains
going
where
they
liked
and
stopping
where
they
liked
it
was
more
endurable
to
diana
than
any
other
way
of
spending
those
days
could
have
been
the
constant
change
and
activity
and
the
variety
of
new
things
always
claiming
attention
and
admiration
gave
her
all
the
help
circumstances
could
give
they
offered
abundance
of
subjects
for
masters
to
talk
about
and
diana
could
listen
and
with
a
word
or
two
now
and
then
get
along
quite
passably
but
of
all
the
beauty
they
went
through
of
all
the
glory
of
those
june
days
of
all
the
hours
of
conversation
that
went
on
diana
kept
in
her
memory
but
the
one
fact
of
continual
striving
to
hinder
masters
from
seeing
her
heart
she
supposed
she
succeeded
she
never
could
tell
for
one
other
thing
forced
itself
upon
her
consciousness
as
the
days
went
on
a
growing
appreciation
of
this
man
whom
she
did
not
love
his
gentleness
of
manner
his
tender
care
and
consideration
for
her
the
even
sweetness
of
temper
which
nothing
disturbed
and
which
would
let
nothing
disturb
her
playing
with
inconveniences
which
he
could
not
remove
and
then
beneath
all
that
a
strength
of
character
and
steady
force
of
will
which
commanded
her
utmost
respect
and
drew
forth
her
fullest
confidence
it
hurt
conscience
terribly
that
she
had
given
this
man
a
wife
who
as
she
said
to
herself
was
utterly
unworthy
of
him
to
make
this
loss
good
so
far
as
any
possible
service
or
could
she
would
have
done
anything
or
submitted
to
anything
it
was
the
one
wish
left
her
what
do
you
think
of
going
home
masters
asked
suddenly
one
evening
they
had
come
back
from
a
glorious
ramble
over
the
nearest
mountain
and
were
sitting
after
supper
in
front
of
the
small
where
they
had
found
lodging
looking
out
upon
the
view
twilight
was
settling
down
upon
the
green
hills
diana
started
and
repeated
his
word
home
yes
i
mean
pleasant
valley
said
the
minister
smiling
not
the
house
where
i
first
saw
you
there
are
one
or
two
sick
people
from
whom
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
be
long
away
you
always
think
of
other
people
first
said
diana
almost
with
a
sigh
so
do
you
no
i
do
not
i
do
not
think
i
do
it
seems
to
me
i
have
always
thought
most
of
myself
you
can
begin
now
then
to
do
better
in
thinking
of
you
first
you
mean
o
yes
i
do
i
will
but
you
think
of
people
you
do
not
care
for
no
i
do
never
you
can
not
think
of
people
you
do
not
care
for
in
the
way
you
mean
they
will
not
come
into
your
head
how
can
one
do
then
basil
how
do
do
obviously
the
only
way
is
to
care
for
them
who
is
sick
in
pleasant
valley
nobody
you
know
one
is
an
old
man
who
lives
back
on
the
mountain
the
other
is
a
woman
near
blackberry
hill
blackberry
hill
do
you
go
now
and
then
but
those
are
dreadful
people
there
well
said
the
minister
they
want
help
so
much
the
more
help
to
live
do
you
mean
they
do
stealing
enough
for
that
nobody
by
stealing
said
the
minister
it
is
one
of
the
ways
of
death
and
help
to
live
is
just
what
they
want
but
shall
they
believe
on
him
of
whom
they
have
not
heard
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
preacher
and
do
you
to
them
in
that
place
i
try
but
there
is
no
church
there
when
you
have
got
anything
to
do
said
the
minister
with
a
dry
sort
of
humourousness
which
belonged
to
him
it
is
best
not
be
stopped
by
trifles
where
do
you
preach
then
basil
wherever
i
can
find
a
man
or
a
woman
to
listen
to
me
in
the
houses
exclaimed
diana
why
not
well
we
never
had
a
minister
in
pleasant
valley
like
you
before
did
you
i
do
believe
anybody
ever
went
to
those
people
to
preach
to
them
until
you
went
they
had
a
good
deal
of
that
appearance
masters
assented
but
diana
began
again
after
a
short
pause
to
go
back
basil
you
do
not
for
those
people
i
think
i
do
said
the
minister
very
quietly
i
suppose
you
do
said
diana
in
a
sort
of
admiration
but
how
can
you
easy
to
tell
was
the
answer
god
made
them
and
god
loves
them
i
love
all
that
my
father
loves
and
christ
died
for
them
and
i
seek
the
lost
whom
my
master
came
to
save
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
but
has
in
him
the
possibility
of
glory
and
i
see
that
possibility
and
when
i
see
it
diana
it
seems
to
me
a
small
thing
to
give
my
life
if
need
be
that
it
may
be
realized
i
am
not
good
enough
to
be
your
wife
said
diana
sinking
her
head
and
her
secret
was
very
deep
does
that
mean
that
you
object
to
the
cutting
short
of
our
holiday
the
minister
asked
in
his
former
tone
of
dry
humourous
suggestion
i
said
diana
looking
up
and
meeting
his
eyes
no
certainly
i
am
ready
for
whatever
you
wish
and
whenever
you
wish
i
do
wish
it
at
all
said
the
minister
giving
a
somewhat
longing
look
at
the
green
wilderness
before
them
of
which
the
lovely
hilly
outlines
were
all
that
the
gathering
twilight
left
distinct
but
the
thing
is
di
i
can
not
play
when
i
ought
to
be
working
it
made
little
difference
to
diana
indeed
she
had
a
hope
that
in
her
new
home
she
would
find
as
she
always
had
found
in
her
old
home
engrossing
duties
that
would
make
her
part
easier
to
get
through
and
in
some
measure
put
a
check
to
the
rush
of
thought
and
feeling
so
with
her
full
consent
the
very
next
day
they
set
out
upon
their
journey
home
it
was
not
a
great
journey
indeed
a
long
day
drive
would
do
it
their
horse
was
fresh
and
they
had
time
for
a
comfortable
rest
and
dinner
at
the
afternoon
was
very
fair
and
as
they
began
to
get
among
the
hills
overlooking
pleasant
valley
something
in
air
or
light
reminded
diana
of
the
time
two
years
ago
when
she
had
gone
up
the
brook
with
evan
she
began
to
talk
to
get
rid
of
her
thoughts
what
a
nice
comfortable
little
carriage
this
is
basil
where
did
it
come
from
from
boston
from
boston
i
thought
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
pleasant
valley
that
ever
i
saw
but
how
did
you
get
it
from
boston
where
the
difficulty
said
the
minister
sitting
at
ease
sideways
on
the
front
seat
and
looking
in
at
her
he
had
put
diana
on
the
back
seat
that
she
might
take
a
more
resting
position
than
there
was
room
for
beside
him
why
it
so
far
railway
comes
to
manchester
i
received
it
there
and
that
is
only
ten
miles
i
rode
saladin
over
a
few
days
ago
and
drove
him
back
i
had
ordered
the
set
of
harness
sent
with
the
rockaway
ecco
echo
said
diana
where
a
very
sweet
echo
said
the
minister
smiling
did
you
hear
it
no
but
basil
do
you
mean
that
this
carriage
is
yours
no
it
is
yours
mine
then
you
have
bought
it
did
it
cost
a
great
deal
i
thought
not
if
you
like
it
certainly
not
o
basil
you
are
very
good
said
diana
humbly
but
indeed
i
do
not
want
you
to
go
to
any
expense
ever
for
me
i
am
not
a
poor
man
diana
are
you
i
thought
you
were
what
right
had
you
to
think
anything
about
it
i
thought
ministers
were
always
poor
i
am
an
exception
then
and
basil
you
never
acted
like
a
rich
man
i
am
not
going
to
di
do
you
want
to
act
like
a
rich
woman
spite
of
her
desperate
downheartedness
diana
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
at
his
manner
i
do
not
wish
anything
different
from
you
she
answered
it
is
best
for
every
reason
if
you
would
use
money
to
advantage
in
a
place
like
this
not
to
make
a
show
of
it
and
in
other
places
if
you
would
use
it
to
advantage
you
make
a
show
of
it
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
but
short
of
that
di
we
can
do
what
we
like
i
know
what
you
like
she
said
i
shall
find
out
what
you
like
in
the
first
place
where
do
you
think
you
are
going
where
i
never
thought
about
it
i
suppose
to
mrs
persimmon
i
do
think
you
would
like
that
the
place
was
not
exactly
pleasant
and
the
house
accommodations
did
very
well
for
me
but
would
not
have
been
comfortable
for
you
so
i
have
set
up
housekeeping
in
another
locality
do
you
know
where
a
woman
named
cophetua
lives
i
never
heard
of
her
out
of
your
beat
she
lives
a
little
off
the
road
to
the
blackberry
hill
i
have
taken
her
house
and
put
a
woman
in
it
to
do
whatever
you
want
done
i
but
we
never
kept
help
since
i
can
remember
basil
not
house
help
well
that
proves
nothing
but
i
do
need
anybody
i
can
do
all
that
we
want
you
will
find
enough
to
do
masters
quickened
the
pace
of
his
horse
and
diana
sat
back
in
the
carriage
half
dismayed
she
longed
to
lose
herself
in
work
and
she
wished
for
nothing
less
than
eyes
to
watch
her
it
was
almost
evening
when
they
got
home
the
place
was
as
masters
had
said
out
of
what
had
been
diana
way
hitherto
in
a
part
of
pleasant
valley
which
was
at
one
side
of
the
high
road
the
situation
was
very
pretty
overlooking
a
wide
sweep
of
the
valley
bottom
with
its
rich
cultivation
and
its
encircling
border
of
green
wooded
hills
as
to
the
house
it
was
not
distinguished
in
any
way
beyond
its
compeers
it
was
rather
low
it
was
as
brown
as
starling
house
it
had
no
giant
elms
to
hang
over
it
and
veil
its
uncomelinesses
but
just
behind
it
rose
a
green
hill
the
house
indeed
stood
on
the
lower
slope
of
the
hill
which
fell
off
more
gently
towards
the
bottom
behind
the
house
it
lifted
up
a
very
steep
rocky
wall
yet
not
so
steep
but
that
it
was
grown
with
beautiful
forest
trees
set
off
against
its
background
of
wood
and
hill
the
house
looked
rather
cosy
it
had
been
put
in
nice
order
and
even
the
little
plot
of
ground
in
front
had
been
cleared
of
thistles
and
hollyhocks
which
had
held
a
divided
reign
and
trimmed
into
neatness
though
there
had
not
been
time
yet
for
grass
or
flowers
to
grow
within
the
house
about
this
time
at
one
of
the
two
lower
front
windows
a
little
woman
stood
looking
out
and
speculating
on
the
extreme
solitariness
of
the
situation
she
had
nobody
to
communicate
her
sentiments
to
or
she
could
have
been
eloquent
on
the
subject
the
golden
glow
and
shimmer
of
the
setting
sun
all
over
the
wide
landscape
it
may
be
said
with
truth
she
did
not
see
to
her
it
was
nothing
but
sunshine
a
natural
and
necessary
accessory
of
the
sun
presence
when
clouds
did
not
happen
to
come
over
the
sky
i
think
she
really
saw
nothing
but
the
extreme
emptiness
of
the
picture
before
her
just
that
one
fact
that
there
was
nothing
to
see
therefore
it
was
on
various
accounts
an
event
when
the
rockaway
hove
in
sight
and
the
grey
horse
stopped
before
the
gate
it
did
not
occur
to
miss
collins
then
to
go
out
to
the
carriage
to
receive
bundles
or
baskets
or
render
help
generally
she
had
got
something
to
look
at
and
she
looked
only
when
the
minister
having
tied
saladin
head
came
leading
the
way
through
the
little
courtyard
to
the
front
door
did
it
occur
to
his
help
to
open
the
same
there
she
stood
smiling
the
blankest
of
smiles
which
made
diana
want
to
get
rid
of
her
on
the
instant
well
of
all
things
was
her
salutation
uttered
in
a
high
key
if
it
ai
you
i
never
was
so
beat
why
i
did
look
for
ye
this
long
spell
yet
wo
you
let
us
come
in
miss
collins
seeing
we
are
here
la
i
glad
to
see
ye
was
the
answer
as
she
stepped
back
and
stepping
further
back
as
masters
advanced
at
last
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
her
kitchen
which
was
the
front
room
on
that
side
and
backed
in
followed
by
the
minister
and
at
a
little
interval
by
his
wife
miss
collins
went
on
talking
how
do
masters
i
speck
i
ca
be
under
no
mistake
as
to
the
personality
though
i
hai
had
the
pleasure
o
a
introduction
but
i
thought
honeymoon
folks
allays
make
it
last
as
long
as
they
could
she
went
on
turning
her
eyes
from
diana
to
the
minister
again
and
you
been
no
time
at
all
what
have
you
got
in
the
house
miss
collins
anything
for
supper
i
am
hungry
said
the
latter
wall
happiness
makes
some
folks
hungry
and
some
they
say
it
feeds
miss
collins
returned
folks
is
so
unlike
but
if
you
hungry
masters
you
have
to
have
leaving
her
to
prepare
it
with
a
laughing
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
minister
led
diana
out
of
that
room
and
along
a
short
passage
to
another
door
the
passage
was
very
narrow
the
ceiling
was
low
the
walls
whitewashed
the
wainscotting
blue
and
yet
the
room
which
they
entered
though
sharing
in
all
the
items
of
this
description
was
homely
and
comfortable
it
was
furnished
in
a
way
that
made
it
seem
elegant
to
diana
a
dark
carpet
on
the
floor
two
or
three
a
wide
lounge
covered
with
chintz
and
chintz
curtains
at
the
windows
on
the
walls
here
and
there
single
shelves
of
dark
wood
put
up
for
books
and
filled
with
them
a
pretty
lamp
on
the
little
leaf
table
and
a
wide
fireplace
with
bright
brass
andirons
the
windows
looked
out
upon
the
wooded
diana
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
admiration
this
is
your
room
di
said
the
minister
the
kitchen
has
the
view
i
did
think
of
changing
about
and
making
the
kitchen
here
but
the
other
room
has
so
long
been
used
in
that
way
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
a
bad
exchange
however
we
will
do
it
yet
if
you
like
change
why
this
room
is
beautiful
cried
diana
looks
out
into
the
hill
o
i
like
that
do
make
it
a
principle
to
like
everything
i
do
said
he
smiling
but
i
like
it
basil
i
like
it
better
than
the
other
side
said
diana
i
just
love
the
trees
and
the
rocks
and
you
can
hear
the
birds
sing
and
the
room
is
most
beautiful
masters
had
opened
the
windows
and
there
came
in
a
spicy
breath
from
the
woods
together
with
the
wild
warble
of
a
it
was
so
wild
and
sweet
they
both
were
still
to
listen
the
notes
almost
broke
diana
heart
but
she
would
not
show
that
what
do
you
think
that
bird
is
saying
she
asked
i
do
know
what
it
may
be
to
mind
i
know
what
it
to
mine
pray
what
does
it
say
to
yours
it
is
too
plaintive
for
the
bird
to
know
what
it
means
said
diana
probably
i
have
no
doubt
the
ancients
were
right
when
they
felt
certain
animals
to
be
types
of
good
and
others
of
evil
i
think
it
is
true
in
detail
and
variety
i
have
the
same
feeling
and
in
like
manner
carrying
out
the
principle
i
hear
one
bird
say
one
thing
and
another
another
in
their
countless
varieties
of
song
did
the
ancients
think
that
do
you
remember
the
distinction
between
clean
beasts
and
unclean
i
thought
that
was
ordered
it
was
ordered
to
be
observed
the
distinction
was
felt
before
they
were
again
silent
a
moment
while
the
thrush
song
filled
the
air
with
liquid
rejoicing
that
bird
said
diana
slowly
sings
as
if
he
had
got
somewhere
above
all
the
sins
and
troubles
and
fights
of
life
i
mean
as
if
he
were
a
human
being
who
had
got
there
that
will
do
said
the
minister
but
that
impossible
so
why
should
he
sing
it
take
it
the
other
way
said
the
minister
smiling
you
mean
said
diana
looking
up
for
she
had
sat
down
before
the
open
window
and
he
stood
by
her
side
you
mean
he
would
not
sing
a
false
note
nor
god
make
a
promise
he
would
not
fulfil
come
but
basil
how
could
the
bird
song
be
a
promise
from
god
think
he
gave
the
song
diana
as
has
been
said
of
visible
things
in
nature
so
it
may
be
said
of
audible
things
every
one
of
them
is
expression
of
a
thought
of
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
and
diana
mind
was
too
full
to
give
one
they
went
the
room
over
diana
was
arranged
to
be
masters
study
the
other
above
the
kitchen
looked
out
upon
a
glorious
view
of
the
rich
valley
and
its
encompassing
hills
both
were
exceedingly
neat
and
pretty
in
their
furniture
and
arrangements
in
all
of
which
diana
comfort
had
been
sedulously
cared
for
her
husband
showed
her
the
closet
for
her
boxes
and
opened
the
huge
press
prepared
for
her
clothes
and
taking
off
her
bonnet
welcomed
her
tenderly
home
but
it
seemed
to
diana
as
if
everything
stifled
her
and
she
would
have
liked
to
flee
to
the
hills
like
the
wild
creatures
that
had
their
home
there
her
outward
demeanour
for
all
that
was
dignified
and
sweet
whatever
she
felt
she
would
not
give
pain
you
are
too
good
to
me
she
murmured
i
will
be
as
good
as
i
can
basil
to
you
i
know
it
said
he
and
i
think
i
had
better
begin
she
presently
added
more
lightly
by
going
down
and
seeing
how
miss
collins
and
supper
are
getting
on
i
daresay
they
will
get
on
to
some
sort
of
consummation
it
will
be
a
better
consummation
if
you
let
me
go
perhaps
he
divined
something
of
her
feeling
for
he
made
no
objection
and
diana
escaped
with
a
sense
that
her
only
refuge
was
in
action
to
do
something
no
matter
what
and
stop
thinking
yet
when
she
went
she
went
first
to
the
back
room
and
to
the
open
window
to
see
if
she
could
catch
the
note
of
the
thrush
once
more
it
came
to
her
like
a
voice
from
the
other
world
he
was
still
singing
somewhere
up
amid
the
cool
shades
of
the
hemlocks
and
oaks
on
the
hill
from
out
the
dusky
twilight
of
their
tops
sending
his
tremulous
trills
of
triumph
down
the
hillside
he
was
undoubtedly
having
a
good
time
diana
listened
a
minute
and
then
went
to
the
kitchen
miss
collins
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
contemplating
it
or
the
kettle
she
had
hung
over
it
where
is
masters
supper
diana
began
do
you
take
none
was
the
rejoinder
i
mean
what
can
we
have
you
can
have
all

is
and
there

nothin
in
the
house
but
what

diana
if

pork
ai
it
eggs
yes
there

la
i
did
expect
ye
want
potatoes
at
this
time
o
day
diana
informed
herself
of
the
places
of
things
and
set
herself
and
miss
collins
vigorously
to
work
the
handmaid
looked
on
somewhat
ungraciously
at
the
quiet
competent
energy
of
her
superior
the
smile
on
her
broad
mouth
gradually
fading
reckon
you
do
know
me
she
remarked
presently
yes
i
do
said
diana
you
are
jemima
collins
that
used
to
live
at
the
post
office
how
came
you
here
wall
there
nothin
but
changes
in
the
world
i
expect
that
life
mis
reems
to
the
post
office
had
her
mother
come
home
to
live
with
her
owin
to
her
father
gettin
his
arm
took
off
in
some
which
was
the
death
o
him
so
the
mother
come
home
to
her
daughter
and
then
they
made
it
out
as
they
two
was
equal
to
all
there
was
to
do
and
i
do
say
they
war
but
that
was
reason
enough
why
they
did
want
me
no
longer
and
then
i
stayed
with
miss
gunn
a
spell
helpin
her
get
her
house
cleaned
and
then
the
minister
made
out
as
he
wanted
a
real
person
for
to
take
care
o
house
and
miss
gunn
she
told
him
what
she
knowed
about
me
and
so
i
moved
in
la
it
a
change
from
the
post
office
it
was
sort
o
lively
there
allays
comin
and
goin
and
lots
o
news
diana
made
no
answer
the
very
mention
of
the
post
office
gave
her
a
sort
of
pang
about
that
spot
her
hopes
had
hovered
for
so
long
and
with
such
bitter
disillusionising
she
sent
miss
collins
to
set
the
table
in
the
other
room
and
presently
having
finished
her
cookery
followed
with
it
herself
chapter
xxiii
supper
at
home
the
windows
were
open
still
and
the
dusky
air
without
was
full
of
cool
freshness
in
the
wide
fireplace
the
minister
had
kindled
a
fire
and
in
a
little
blue
teapot
he
was
just
making
the
tea
the
kettle
stood
on
the
hearth
it
was
as
pretty
and
cheerful
a
home
view
as
any
bride
need
wish
to
see
for
the
first
evening
in
her
new
house
diana
knew
it
and
took
the
effect
which
possibly
was
only
heightened
by
the
consciousness
that
she
wished
herself
five
hundred
miles
away
what
the
picture
was
to
her
husband
she
had
no
idea
nor
that
the
crowning
feature
of
it
was
her
own
beautiful
sweet
presence
miss
collins
brought
in
the
prepared
dishes
and
left
the
two
alone
i
see
i
have
fallen
into
new
hands
the
minister
remarked
presently
persimmon
never
cooked
these
eggs
you
must
have
been
tired
of
living
in
that
way
i
should
think
no
i
never
get
tired
of
anything
not
of
bad
things
no
i
get
rid
of
them
but
how
can
you
different
ways
can
you
do
everything
you
want
to
basil
his
wife
asked
with
an
incredulous
sort
of
admiration
i
do
everything
you
want
me
to
do
you
have
already
and
more
she
said
with
a
sigh
how
will
your
helpmeet
in
the
other
room
answer
the
purpose
i
have
never
been
used
to
have
anybody
you
know
basil
and
i
do
not
need
any
one
i
can
do
all
easily
myself
i
know
you
can
i
do
not
wish
you
should
then
what
will
you
give
me
to
do
plenty
i
do
care
what
if
i
can
only
be
busy
i
can
not
bear
to
be
idle
what
shall
i
do
basil
is
there
nothing
you
would
like
to
study
that
you
have
never
had
a
chance
to
learn
learn
said
diana
a
whole
vista
of
possible
new
activities
opening
all
at
once
before
her
mind
eye
o
yes
i
would
like
to
learn
to
study
what
basil
what
would
you
like
to
take
hold
of
i
would
like
latin
latin
cried
the
minister
that
an
excellent
choice
greek
too
i
would
like
to
learn
greek
very
much
but
i
suppose
i
must
begin
with
one
at
once
how
about
modern
languages
you
know
said
diana
shyly
i
can
have
no
teacher
but
you
and
you
stand
in
doubt
as
to
my
qualifications
prudent
i
will
learn
anything
you
like
to
teach
me
said
diana
and
her
look
was
both
very
sweet
and
very
humble
withal
had
something
of
an
anxious
strain
in
it
then
there
another
thing
do
you
want
to
help
me
how
in
my
work
how
can
i
i
do
believe
you
know
what
my
work
is
said
the
minister
dryly
do
you
now
i
thought
i
did
said
diana
preaching
sermons
to
wit
said
the
minister
but
that
is
only
one
item
my
business
is
to
work
in
my
master
vineyard
yes
and
i
thought
that
was
how
you
did
it
but
a
man
may
preach
many
sermons
and
do
never
a
bit
of
work
of
the
sort
i
mentioned
what
is
the
sort
then
basil
i
show
you
when
we
get
away
from
the
table
it
is
time
you
knew
so
when
the
supper
tray
and
miss
collins
were
gone
the
minister
took
his
bible
and
made
diana
sit
down
beside
him
where
they
could
both
look
over
it
your
notion
of
a
minister
is
that
he
is
a
sort
of
machine
to
make
sermons
i
never
thought
you
were
a
of
any
sort
said
diana
gently
no
of
course
not
but
you
thought
that
was
my
special
business
did
you
now
look
of
man
i
have
made
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
israel
therefore
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth
and
give
them
warning
from
me
a
watchman
diana
repeated
it
is
a
responsible
post
too
for
see
over
here
the
watchman
see
the
sword
come
and
blow
not
the
trumpet
and
the
people
be
not
warned
if
the
sword
come
and
take
any
person
from
among
them
he
is
taken
away
in
his
iniquity
his
blood
will
i
require
at
the
watchman
do
you
mean
basil
yes
i
mean
all
that
you
can
understand
now
what
was
in
paul
mind
and
what
a
great
word
it
was
when
he
said
to
the
ephesian
elders
take
you
to
record
this
day
that
i
am
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men
he
had
done
his
whole
duty
in
that
place
i
never
felt
that
old
hardenburgh
warned
us
against
anything
diana
remarked
did
i
you
began
to
make
me
uncomfortable
almost
as
soon
as
you
came
that
good
said
the
minister
quietly
now
see
these
words
diana
ye
into
all
the
world
and
tell
the
good
news
to
everybody
the
gospel
said
diana
that
is
simply
telling
the
good
news
is
it
certainly
but
basil
it
never
seemed
so
there
was
a
reason
for
that
cold
waters
to
a
thirsty
soul
so
is
good
news
from
a
far
country
you
were
not
thirsty
that
is
all
basil
said
diana
almost
tremulously
i
think
i
am
now
well
said
her
husband
tenderly
you
know
who
could
say
and
did
say
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
me
and
drink
am
the
bread
of
life
he
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
thirst
that
bringing
together
of
need
and
supply
while
yet
need
does
not
see
how
it
is
to
stretch
out
its
hand
to
take
the
supply
how
sharp
and
how
pitiful
it
makes
the
sense
of
longing
diana
drooped
her
head
till
it
touched
basil
arm
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
would
fairly
break
but
that
does
mean
she
said
bringing
out
her
words
with
hesitation
and
difficulty
that
does
not
mean
hunger
of
every
sort
yes
of
earthly
sorts
basil
how
can
it
people
desires
for
so
many
things
is
there
any
limit
or
qualification
to
the
promise
not
there
is
there
anywhere
else
diana
was
silent
there
is
none
anywhere
except
the
limit
put
by
the
faith
of
the
applicant
i
have
known
a
person
starving
to
death
relieved
for
the
time
even
from
the
pangs
of
bodily
hunger
by
the
food
which
christ
gave
her
there
is
no
condition
of
human
extremity
for
which
he
is
not
sufficient
but
said
diana
still
speaking
with
difficulty
that
is
for
some
people
for
some
people
and
for
everybody
else
but
he
would
not
like
to
have
anybody
go
to
him
just
for
such
a
reason
he
will
never
ask
you
came
if
you
come
he
was
in
this
world
to
relieve
misery
and
to
save
from
it
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
is
his
own
word
he
will
help
you
if
you
will
let
him
diana
diana
head
pressed
more
heavily
against
basil
arm
the
temptation
was
to
break
out
into
wild
weeping
at
this
contact
of
sympathy
but
she
would
not
did
her
husband
guess
how
much
she
was
in
want
of
help
that
thought
half
frightened
her
presently
she
raised
her
head
and
sat
up
here
is
another
verse
said
her
husband
which
tells
of
a
part
of
my
work
ye
into
the
highways
and
as
many
as
ye
shall
find
to
the
i
do
understand
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
a
certain
king
which
made
a
marriage
for
his
son
it
means
rather
a
wedding
entertainment
how
basil
the
bridegroom
is
christ
the
bride
is
the
whole
company
of
his
redeemed
the
time
is
by
and
by
when
they
shall
be
all
gathered
together
all
washed
from
defilement
all
dressed
in
the
white
robes
of
the
king
court
which
are
given
them
and
delivered
from
the
last
shadow
of
mortal
sorrow
and
infirmity
then
in
glory
begins
their
perfected
everlasting
union
with
christ
then
the
wedding
is
celebrated
and
the
supper
signifies
the
fulness
and
communion
of
his
joy
in
them
and
their
joy
in
him
basil
voice
was
a
little
subdued
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
and
he
paused
a
few
minutes
it
is
my
business
to
bid
people
to
that
supper
he
said
then
and
i
bid
you
di
i
will
go
basil
but
the
words
were
low
and
the
tears
burst
forth
and
diana
hurried
away
chapter
xxiv
the
minister
wife
diana
plunged
herself
now
into
business
she
was
quite
in
earnest
in
the
promise
she
had
made
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
last
recorded
but
to
set
about
a
work
is
one
thing
and
to
carry
it
through
is
another
and
diana
did
not
immediately
see
light
in
the
meanwhile
the
pressure
of
the
bonds
of
her
new
existence
was
only
to
be
borne
by
forgetting
it
in
intense
occupation
her
husband
wanted
her
to
study
many
things
for
her
own
sake
and
for
his
own
sake
he
wished
it
knowing
that
her
education
had
been
exceedingly
and
imperfect
he
wanted
all
sources
of
growth
and
pleasure
to
be
open
to
her
and
he
wanted
full
communion
with
his
wife
in
his
own
life
and
so
he
took
her
hands
from
the
and
the
preserving
kettle
and
put
dictionaries
and
philosophies
into
them
on
her
part
besides
the
negative
incitement
of
losing
herself
and
her
troubles
in
books
diana
mental
nature
was
too
sound
and
rich
not
to
take
kindly
the
new
seeds
dropped
into
the
soil
she
had
gone
just
far
enough
in
her
own
private
reading
and
thinking
to
be
all
ready
to
spring
forward
in
the
wider
sphere
to
which
she
was
invited
and
in
which
a
hand
took
hers
to
help
her
along
the
consciousness
of
awakening
power
too
and
of
enlarging
the
bounds
of
her
world
drew
her
on
sometimes
in
study
where
he
had
arranged
a
place
for
her
sometimes
in
her
own
little
parlour
diana
pored
over
books
and
turned
the
leaves
of
dictionaries
and
felt
her
way
along
the
mazes
of
latin
stateliness
or
wondered
and
thrilled
at
the
beauty
of
the
greek
words
of
the
new
testament
as
her
husband
explained
them
to
her
or
she
wrought
out
problems
or
she
wrote
abstracts
or
she
dived
into
depths
of
philosophical
speculation
then
diana
began
to
learn
french
and
very
soon
was
delighting
herself
in
one
or
other
of
a
fine
collection
of
french
classics
which
filled
certain
shelves
in
the
library
there
was
besides
all
the
motives
above
mentioned
which
quickened
and
stimulated
her
zeal
for
learning
another
very
subtle
underlying
cause
which
had
not
a
little
to
do
with
her
unflagging
energy
in
pursuit
of
her
objects
nay
there
were
two
diana
did
earnestly
wish
to
please
her
husband
and
for
his
sake
to
become
so
far
as
cultivation
would
do
it
a
fit
companion
for
him
that
she
knew
but
she
scarcely
knew
how
beneath
all
that
and
mightier
than
all
that
was
the
impulse
to
make
herself
worthy
of
the
other
man
whose
companion
now
she
would
never
be
subtle
as
so
many
of
our
springs
of
action
are
unrecognised
it
drove
her
with
an
incessant
impulse
to
be
such
a
woman
as
evan
would
have
been
proud
of
such
a
one
as
he
would
have
liked
to
stand
by
his
side
anywhere
one
that
he
need
not
have
feared
to
present
in
any
society
diana
strove
for
it
and
that
although
evan
would
never
know
it
and
it
did
not
in
the
least
concern
him
and
as
she
felt
from
time
to
time
that
she
was
attaining
her
end
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
what
she
wished
to
be
diana
was
glad
with
a
secret
joy
which
was
not
the
love
of
knowledge
nor
the
pride
of
personal
ambition
nor
the
duty
of
an
affectionate
wife
as
i
said
she
did
not
recognise
it
if
she
had
i
think
she
would
have
tried
to
banish
it
one
afternoon
she
was
sitting
by
her
table
at
the
study
window
where
she
had
been
very
busy
but
was
not
busy
now
the
window
was
open
the
warm
summer
air
came
in
and
over
the
hills
and
the
lowland
the
brilliance
and
glow
of
the
evening
sunlight
was
just
at
its
brightest
diana
sat
gazing
out
while
her
thoughts
went
wandering
suddenly
she
pulled
them
up
and
her
question
was
rather
a
departure
though
standing
in
a
certain
negative
connection
with
them
basil
i
ca
make
out
just
what
is
can
not
you
no
can
you
help
me
the
bible
says
i
believe
i
believe
everything
it
tells
me
and
you
tell
me
but
i
have
not
faith
how
do
you
know
that
if
i
had
i
should
be
a
christian
and
you
think
you
are
not
i
am
sure
i
am
not
are
you
willing
i
think
i
am
willing
diana
answered
slowly
looking
out
into
the
sunlight
if
you
are
right
then
faith
must
be
something
more
than
mere
belief
what
more
is
it
she
said
eagerly
turning
her
face
towards
him
now
i
think
the
heart
has
its
part
in
it
as
well
as
the
head
and
it
is
with
the
heart
that
the
difficulty
lies
in
true
bible
faith
the
heart
gives
its
confidence
where
the
intellect
has
given
its
assent
the
man
believeth
unto
righteousness
that
is
what
the
lord
wants
our
personal
trust
in
him
unreserved
and
limitless
trust
trust
said
diana
then
why
can
not
i
give
it
why
do
i
that
is
the
question
to
be
answered
but
di
the
heart
can
not
yield
that
confident
trust
so
long
as
there
is
any
point
in
dispute
between
it
and
god
so
long
as
there
is
any
consciousness
of
holding
back
something
from
him
or
refusing
something
to
him
disobedience
and
trust
can
not
go
together
it
is
not
the
child
who
is
standing
out
in
rebellion
who
can
stretch
out
his
hand
for
his
father
gifts
and
know
that
they
will
be
given
do
you
think
i
am
rebelling
basil
i
can
not
see
into
your
heart
di
what
could
i
be
back
from
god
unconditional
surrender
surrender
of
what
yourself
your
will
when
you
have
made
that
surrender
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
trusting
there
never
is
diana
turned
to
the
window
again
and
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
sunlight
left
the
bottom
lands
and
crept
up
the
hills
and
faded
out
of
the
sky
dusk
and
dews
of
twilight
fell
all
around
and
the
dusk
deepened
till
the
stars
began
to
shine
out
here
and
there
sweet
summer
scents
came
in
on
the
air
sweet
chirrup
of
insects
made
their
gentle
running
commentary
on
the
silence
miss
collins
had
long
ago
caused
the
little
bell
with
which
she
was
wont
to
notify
her
employers
that
their
meals
were
ready
to
sound
its
tinkling
call
to
supper
but
diana
had
not
heard
it
and
the
minister
would
not
disturb
her
it
was
after
a
very
long
time
of
this
silence
that
she
rose
came
to
the
table
where
he
was
sitting
and
knelt
down
beside
it
i
believe
she
said
and
i
basil
he
took
her
hand
but
said
nothing
otherwise
he
could
not
see
her
face
for
she
had
laid
it
down
upon
some
books
and
besides
the
room
was
very
dusky
now
but
when
he
expected
some
further
words
which
should
tell
of
relief
or
joy
to
his
surprise
he
felt
that
diana
was
weeping
and
then
that
her
tears
had
grown
into
a
storm
most
strange
for
her
who
very
rarely
let
him
or
anyone
see
the
outbursts
of
such
feeling
indeed
even
by
herself
she
was
very
slow
to
come
to
the
indulgence
of
tears
it
was
not
her
way
now
before
she
was
aware
they
were
flowing
and
as
it
is
with
some
natures
if
you
open
the
at
all
a
flood
pours
forth
which
makes
it
impossible
to
shut
them
again
for
a
while
and
this
time
i
think
she
forgot
that
anybody
was
by
he
was
puzzled
was
it
joy
or
sorrow
hard
for
herself
to
tell
there
was
so
much
of
both
in
it
for
with
the
very
first
finding
of
a
sufficient
refuge
and
help
for
her
trouble
diana
had
brought
her
burden
to
his
feet
and
there
was
weeping
convulsively
partly
from
the
sense
of
the
burden
partly
with
the
sense
of
laying
it
down
and
with
the
might
of
that
infinite
sympathy
the
apprehension
of
which
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
her
now
for
the
first
time
what
is
it
like
o
what
is
it
like
it
is
the
dayspring
from
on
high
basil
could
not
read
all
she
was
feeling
and
spell
it
out
but
i
think
he
had
a
sort
of
instinct
of
it
and
felt
that
his
wife
was
very
far
from
him
in
this
her
agony
of
joy
and
sorrow
for
he
kept
motionless
and
his
broad
brow
which
never
was
wrinkled
was
very
grave
one
hand
he
laid
lightly
upon
diana
shoulder
as
if
so
to
remind
her
of
his
presence
and
close
participation
in
all
that
concerned
her
otherwise
he
did
not
interrupt
her
nor
make
any
claim
upon
her
attention
gradually
diana
sobs
ceased
and
then
she
grew
utterly
still
and
the
two
sat
so
together
for
neither
of
them
knew
how
long
at
last
diana
raised
her
head
you
have
had
no
supper
all
this
while
she
said
i
have
had
something
much
better
said
he
gently
kissing
her
cheek
to
see
me
cry
said
diana
i
do
know
why
i
cried
i
think
i
do
do
you
feel
better
for
it
yes
or
else
for
that
which
made
me
do
so
come
down
basil
at
tea
she
was
perfectly
herself
and
quite
as
usual
except
for
the
different
expression
in
her
face
it
was
hardly
less
grave
than
before
but
something
dark
had
gone
out
and
something
light
had
come
in
i
can
face
the
sewing
society
now
she
remarked
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
the
sewing
society
her
husband
echoed
is
that
much
to
face
i
have
not
been
once
since
i
was
married
and
they
make
so
much
fuss
about
it
i
must
go
now
they
meet
at
mother
what
do
they
sew
they
pretend
to
be
making
up
a
box
for
some
missionary
out
west
i
guess
there
is
no
pretence
about
it
yes
there
is
they
have
been
eight
months
at
work
upon
a
box
to
go
to
iowa
somewhere
to
a
family
very
much
in
want
of
everything
and
the
children
and
mother
are
almost
or
quite
i
guess
in
rags
and
the
ladies
here
are
comfortably
doing
a
little
once
a
week
and
do
even
expect
to
have
the
box
made
up
till
christmas
time
think
of
the
people
in
iowa
waiting
and
waiting
with
hardly
anything
to
put
on
while
we
meet
once
a
week
and
sew
a
little
and
talk
and
have
supper
how
would
you
manage
it
i
would
send
off
the
box
next
week
basil
so
would
i
suppose
now
we
do
send
off
a
box
yes
i
will
give
you
the
money
you
can
go
i
will
drive
you
down
to
gunn
and
you
can
get
there
whatever
you
think
would
be
suitable
and
we
will
have
the
fun
to
ourselves
the
colour
flushed
into
diana
face
it
was
the
first
flush
of
pleasure
that
had
come
there
in
a
long
while
you
are
very
good
basil
she
said
do
you
think
i
could
drive
saladin
where
anywhere
i
mean
that
i
could
go
to
places
then
without
troubling
you
to
drive
me
i
can
stand
so
much
trouble
it
is
not
good
for
a
man
to
live
too
easy
but
it
might
be
convenient
for
you
sometimes
so
it
might
and
pleasant
for
you
no
i
should
not
like
to
trust
you
to
saladin
i
wonder
if
your
mother
would
let
me
have
prince
if
i
offer
her
a
better
horse
in
exchange
perhaps
i
can
do
better
than
that
we
will
see
o
basil
you
must
not
get
another
horse
for
me
i
will
get
anything
i
like
for
you
but
do
you
mean
and
keep
saladin
too
i
mean
that
saladin
is
necessary
to
me
then
do
basil
i
can
tell
you
people
will
say
you
are
extravagant
if
you
have
two
horses
i
can
not
help
people
talking
scandal
no
but
it
will
hurt
your
influence
well
we
will
feel
the
pulse
of
the
public
but
i
think
they
would
stand
it
they
drove
down
to
starling
the
next
day
masters
had
other
business
and
must
go
farther
diana
went
in
alone
she
was
early
for
she
had
come
to
help
her
mother
make
the
preparations
and
at
first
these
engrossed
them
both
well
said
starling
when
some
time
had
passed
how
do
you
get
along
with
your
husband
diana
eyes
opened
slightly
it
would
be
a
very
strange
person
that
could
not
get
on
with
masters
she
answered
easy
is
he
i
hate
easy
men
the
best
of
are
helpless
enough
but
when
you
get
one
of
the
easy
soft
they
are
consented
if
every
door
hangs
on
one
hinge
diana
made
no
answer
how
does
your
girl
get
along
very
well
pretty
well
what
you
want
with
a
girl
i
do
see
i
did
either
but
masters
wants
me
to
do
other
things
set
you
up
to
be
a
lady
well
the
world
full
o
fools
i
am
as
busy
mother
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
depends
on
what
you
call
business
making
yourself
unfit
for
business
i
should
say
call
it
what
you
like
i
suppose
he
is
your
humble
servant
and
just
gives
you
your
own
way
he
is
not
that
sort
of
man
at
all
mother
he
is
as
kind
as
he
can
be
but
he
is
nobody
humble
servant
then
i
suppose
you
are
his
there
is
somebody
now
diana
it
kate
boddington
do
go
in
and
take
care
of
her
you
can
do
so
much
and
keep
her
from
coming
out
here
where
i
am
well
di
exclaimed
her
relative
as
diana
met
her
ai
it
a
sight
to
see
at
the
sewin
meetin
why
have
you
been
before
seems
to
me
you
make
an
uncommon
long
honeymoon
of
it
diana
natural
sweetness
and
dignity
and
furthermore
the
great
ballast
of
old
pain
and
new
gladness
which
lay
deep
down
in
her
heart
kept
her
quite
steady
and
unruffled
under
all
such
breezes
she
had
many
of
the
like
to
meet
that
day
and
the
sweet
calm
and
poise
of
her
manner
through
them
all
would
have
done
honour
to
the
most
practised
woman
of
the
world
most
of
her
friends
and
neighbours
here
collected
had
scarce
seen
her
since
her
marriage
unless
in
church
and
they
were
curious
to
know
how
she
would
carry
herself
and
curious
in
general
about
many
things
it
was
a
sort
of
battery
that
diana
had
to
face
and
sometimes
a
masked
battery
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
a
shot
hit
what
i
want
to
know
said
boddington
is
where
the
minister
and
you
made
it
up
di
you
were
awful
sly
about
it
ai
that
so
chimed
in
carpenter
i
never
had
no
notion
what
was
goin
on
not
the
smallest
idee
and
i
was
jest
a
sayin
one
day
to
miss
gunn
or
somebody
i
declare
i
do
know
now
who
was
i
was
so
dumbfounded
when
the
news
come
it
took
all
my
memory
away
but
i
was
jes
a
sayin
to
somebody
and
i
remember
it
because
i
been
after
dandelion
greens
and
could
find
none
they
was
jest
about
past
by
then
and
bitter
and
we
was
a
settin
with
our
empty
baskets
and
i
was
jes
tellin
somebody
i
do
know
who
was
who
i
thought
would
make
a
good
wife
for
the
minister
when
up
comes
josiah
and
reaches
me
the
invitation
says
i
he
ai
a
goin
to
have
diana
starling
i
was
beat
i
daresay
you
could
have
fitted
him
just
as
well
remarked
starling
wall
i
do
know
i
was
thinkin
but
i
guess
it
as
well
not
to
say
now
what
i
was
thinkin
that
so
assented
miss
barry
i
do
believe
he
thinks
nobody
could
ha
chosen
for
him
no
better
than
he
has
chosen
for
himself
men
never
do
know
what
is
good
for
them
salter
remarked
but
not
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
gleam
of
fun
in
her
face
i
thankful
anyway
he
hai
done
worse
said
another
lady
i
used
to
be
afraid
he
would
go
and
get
himself
hitched
to
a
euphemie
knowlton
said
salter
yes
i
used
to
wonder
if
we
should
get
our
minister
wife
from
elmfield
it
looked
likely
at
one
time
those
two
would
ha
pulled
well
together
ne
ver
said
another
i
should
like
to
know
how
he
and
di
goin
to
pull
together
said
flandin
acidly
he
goin
one
way
and
she
another
do
you
think
so
mrs
flandin
asked
the
lady
thus
in
a
very
uncomplimentary
manner
referred
to
wall
ai
it
true
said
flandin
judicially
i
do
not
think
it
is
true
wall
i
glad
to
hear
it
i
sure
said
the
other
but
there
a
word
in
the
scriptur
about
two
walking
together
when
they
agreed
masters
and
i
are
agreed
said
diana
while
her
lips
parted
in
a
very
slight
smile
and
a
lovely
tinge
of
came
over
her
cheeks
but
not
in
everything
i
reckon
in
everything
i
know
said
diana
steadily
while
a
considerable
breeze
of
laughter
went
round
the
room
flandin
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
then
it
be
the
worse
for
him
she
remarked
with
a
jerk
at
her
sewing
diana
was
silent
now
but
boddington
took
it
up
do
you
mean
to
say
mis
flandin
you
approve
of
quarrels
between
man
and
wife
and
quarrels
in
high
places
too
high
places
echoed
flandin
when
it
says
that
a
minister
is
to
be
the
servant
of
all
and
ai
he
said
carpenter
is
there
a
place
or
a
thing
our
minister
do
go
to
if
he
wanted
and
does
he
mind
whether
night
or
day
or
rough
or
smooth
and
does
he
care
how
fur
it
is
or
how
long
he
goes
without
his
victuals
i
will
say
i
never
did
see
a
no
more
man
than
is
masters
and
i
a
good
right
to
know
and
i
say
it
with
feelin
of
gratitude
that
jes
so
said
miss
barry
her
eyes
glistening
over
her
knitting
which
they
did
not
need
to
watch
and
there
was
a
hum
of
assent
through
the
room
i
not
sayin
nothin
agin
said
flandin
in
an
injured
manner
but
what
i
was
hintin
i
war
nothin
is
that
he
married
a
a
beauty
said
boddington
i
do
set
no
count
on
beauty
said
the
other
i
allays
think
ef
a
minister
is
a
servant
of
the
lord
and
i
hope
masters
is
it
a
pity
his
wife
should
be
too
that
all
but
i
am
flandin
said
diana
quietly
what
a
servant
of
the
lord
since
when
demanded
the
other
incredulously
does
it
matter
since
when
said
diana
with
a
calm
gentleness
which
spoke
for
her
i
was
not
always
so
but
i
am
now
hev
met
with
a
change
the
other
asked
again
judicially
and
critically
yes
ai
that
good
news
now
said
miss
barry
dropping
her
knitting
and
fairly
wiping
her
eyes
i
hope
your
evidence
is
clear
said
the
other
lady
do
you
want
to
hear
what
they
are
said
diana
i
have
come
to
know
the
lord
jesus
i
have
come
to
believe
in
him
i
have
given
myself
to
be
his
servant
as
truly
his
servant
though
not
so
good
a
one
as
my
husband
is
but
what
he
bids
me
i
do
the
little
assembly
was
silent
silent
all
round
both
the
news
and
the
manner
of
the
teller
of
it
were
imposing
decided
clear
calm
sweet
diana
grey
eyes
as
well
as
her
lips
gave
her
testimony
they
did
not
shrink
from
other
eyes
nor
droop
in
hesitation
or
difficulty
as
little
was
there
a
line
of
daring
or
about
them
the
dignity
of
the
woman
struck
and
hushed
her
companions
our
minister
be
a
happy
man
i
thinkin
said
good
carpenter
speaking
out
what
was
the
secret
thought
of
many
present
you
have
joined
the
church
diana
said
starling
harshly
i
will
do
that
the
first
opportunity
mother
that
your
husband
doing
i
allays
knew
he
wile
a
bird
off
a
bush
i
am
very
thankful
to
him
said
diana
calmly
that
calm
of
hers
was
unapproachable
it
would
neither
take
offence
nor
give
it
although
it
is
true
it
did
irritate
some
of
her
neighbours
and
companions
by
the
very
distance
it
put
between
them
and
her
diana
was
different
from
them
and
growing
more
different
yet
it
was
hard
to
find
fault
she
was
so
handsome
too
that
helped
the
effect
of
superiority
and
her
dress
what
was
there
about
her
dress
it
was
a
pale
lilac
muslin
no
way
remarkable
in
itself
but
it
fell
around
lines
so
soft
and
noble
and
about
so
queenly
a
carriage
it
waved
with
so
quiet
and
graceful
motions
there
was
a
temptation
to
think
diana
must
have
called
in
dressmaking
aid
that
was
not
lawful
for
the
minister
wife
as
the
like
often
happens
diana
was
set
apart
by
a
sorrow
from
all
their
world
of
experience
and
they
thought
she
was
proud
what
did
you
pay
for
that
muslin
diana
flandin
asked
fifteenpence
du
tell
well
i
should
ha
thought
it
was
more
remarked
miss
gunn
it
made
so
elegant
i
made
it
myself
said
diana
smiling
du
tell
said
miss
gunn
again
reviewing
the
gown
for
as
i
hinted
its
draperies
were
graceful
their
lovely
lines
being
unbroken
by
furbelows
and
flummery
and
the
sleeves
were
open
and
half
long
with
a
full
ruffle
which
fell
away
from
diana
beautiful
arms
how
phemie
knowlton
used
to
dress
miss
gunn
went
on
moved
by
some
hidden
association
of
ideas
i
wonder
is
nobody
ever
comin
back
to
elmfield
said
boddington
they
do
do
nothin
with
the
place
and
it
just
waste
the
talk
wandered
on
but
diana
thoughts
remained
fixed
they
had
flown
back
over
the
two
years
since
evan
and
she
had
their
explanation
in
the
blackberry
field
and
for
a
little
while
she
sat
in
a
dream
feeling
the
stings
of
pain
that
seemed
she
thought
to
grow
more
lively
now
instead
of
less
the
coming
in
of
masters
roused
her
and
with
a
sort
of
start
she
put
away
the
thought
of
evan
and
of
days
and
joys
past
for
ever
and
forcibly
swung
herself
back
to
present
things
people
were
very
after
her
husband
came
and
she
did
her
part
she
knew
satisfactorily
for
she
saw
his
eye
now
and
then
resting
on
her
or
meeting
hers
with
the
hidden
smile
in
it
she
had
learned
to
know
and
besides
nothing
was
ever
dull
or
commonplace
where
he
was
so
even
in
starling
house
and
presence
the
rest
of
the
evening
went
brightly
off
and
then
driving
home
through
the
light
of
a
young
moon
and
over
the
quiet
country
diana
watched
the
wonderful
calm
line
where
the
met
the
sky
and
thought
surely
with
the
talisman
she
had
just
found
of
heavenly
love
and
sympathy
and
strength
she
could
walk
the
rest
of
her
way
through
life
and
bear
it
till
the
end
then
by
and
by
beyond
that
dividing
line
of
eternity
there
would
be
bright
heaven
instead
of
the
dusky
earth
if
only
she
could
prevent
basil
from
knowing
how
she
felt
and
so
losing
all
peace
in
life
himself
but
his
peace
was
so
fixed
in
heaven
she
wondered
if
anything
on
earth
could
destroy
it
she
would
not
try
that
question
chapter
xxv
miss
collins
work
it
was
well
for
diana
that
she
had
got
a
talisman
of
better
power
than
the
world
can
manufacture
it
was
well
for
her
too
that
she
followed
up
earnestly
the
clue
to
life
which
had
been
given
her
if
you
have
a
of
supplies
and
are
going
to
have
to
get
to
it
in
the
dark
by
and
by
it
is
good
to
learn
the
way
very
well
while
the
light
is
there
for
weeks
diana
gave
herself
before
all
other
things
to
the
study
of
her
bible
and
to
better
understanding
of
faith
duties
and
privileges
in
all
this
basil
was
a
great
help
and
daily
his
wife
learned
more
and
more
to
admire
and
revere
the
mind
and
temper
of
the
man
she
had
married
reverence
would
have
led
surely
to
love
in
such
a
nature
as
diana
but
diana
heart
was
preoccupied
what
love
could
not
do
however
conscience
and
gratitude
did
as
far
as
possible
nothing
that
concerned
basil
comfort
or
honour
was
uncared
for
by
his
wife
so
among
other
things
she
never
intrusted
the
care
of
his
meals
entirely
to
miss
collins
and
quite
to
that
lady
discomfiture
would
often
come
into
the
kitchen
and
prepare
some
nice
dish
herself
or
superintend
the
preparation
of
it
miss
collins
resented
this
she
shared
the
opinion
of
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
sewing
society
that
masters
was
quite
proud
and
needed
to
be
taken
down
a
bit
and
if
she
got
a
good
chance
she
had
it
in
her
mind
to
do
a
little
of
the
taking
down
herself
it
was
one
evening
late
in
september
frosts
had
hardly
set
in
yet
and
every
change
in
the
light
and
colour
carried
diana
mind
back
to
evan
and
two
years
ago
and
mornings
and
evenings
of
that
time
which
were
so
filled
with
nameless
joys
and
hopes
diana
did
not
give
herself
to
these
thoughts
nor
encourage
them
they
came
with
the
suddenness
and
the
start
of
lightning
merely
the
colour
of
a
hill
at
sunset
was
enough
to
flash
back
her
thoughts
to
an
hour
when
she
was
looking
for
evan
or
a
certain
sort
of
starlight
night
would
recall
a
particular
walk
along
the
meadow
fence
or
a
gust
and
whiff
of
the
wind
would
bring
with
it
the
thrill
that
belonged
to
one
certain
stormy
september
night
that
never
faded
in
her
remembrance
or
the
smell
of
coffee
sometimes
when
it
was
just
at
a
certain
stage
of
preparation
would
turn
her
these
associations
and
remembrances
were
countless
and
incessant
always
under
the
reminders
of
the
september
light
and
atmosphere
and
diana
could
not
escape
from
them
though
as
soon
as
they
came
she
put
them
resolutely
away
this
evening
masters
was
out
diana
knew
he
had
gone
a
long
ride
and
would
be
tired
that
is
if
he
ever
could
be
tired
and
would
be
certainly
ready
for
his
supper
when
he
came
in
so
she
went
out
to
make
ready
a
certain
dish
of
eggs
which
she
knew
he
liked
such
service
as
this
she
could
do
and
she
did
there
was
no
thoughtful
care
no
smallest
observance
which
could
have
been
rendered
by
the
most
devoted
affection
which
diana
did
not
give
to
her
husband
except
she
never
offered
a
kiss
or
laid
her
hand
in
his
or
upon
his
shoulder
happily
for
her
basil
was
not
a
particularly
demonstrative
man
for
every
caress
from
him
was
as
vinegar
upon
nitre
she
did
not
show
repulsion
that
was
all
i
guess
i
kin
do
that
mis
masters
said
her
handmaid
who
always
preferred
to
keep
the
kitchen
for
her
own
domain
diana
made
no
answer
she
was
slowly
and
delicately
peeling
her
eggs
and
probably
did
not
notice
the
remark
miss
collins
however
resented
the
neglect
masters
is
gone
a
great
deal
it
sort
o
lonesome
up
here
on
the
hill
dreadfully
quiet
do
you
think
it
is
i
like
quiet
diana
answered
absently
du
hey
wall
i
allays
liked
life
i
never
could
git
too
much
that
i
should
like
a
soldier
life
uncommon
if
i
was
a
man
diana
had
finished
peeling
her
eggs
and
now
began
to
wash
a
bunch
of
green
parsley
which
she
had
fetched
from
the
garden
daintily
dipping
it
up
and
down
in
a
bowl
of
it
was
kind
o
lively
down
to
the
post
office
miss
collins
remarked
again
eyeing
the
beautiful
arm
and
the
whole
figure
which
in
its
calm
elegance
was
both
imposing
and
irritating
to
her
miss
collins
indeed
had
a
very
undefined
sense
of
the
beautiful
yet
she
vaguely
knew
that
nobody
else
in
pleasant
valley
looked
so
or
carried
herself
so
no
other
woman
dress
adorned
her
so
or
was
so
set
off
by
the
wearer
although
diana
present
attire
was
a
very
print
gown
not
even
the
stylish
ladies
of
elmfield
produced
an
equal
effect
with
their
french
dresses
and
was
not
diana
mis
daughter
and
diana
seemed
not
to
hear
or
care
what
she
had
to
say
everybody
comes
to
the
post
office
she
went
on
grimly
you
only
to
watch
and
you
see
all
the
folks
and
you
know
all
that
is
goin
on
an
that
suits
me
but
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
post
office
said
diana
how
could
you
see
everybody
you
keep
your
eyes
open
and
you
see
things
most
places
said
miss
collins
la
i
used
to
be
in
and
out
why
should
i
and
now
and
then
i
say
to
miss
gunn
jest
fagged
out
with
upon
your
feet
you
jes
go
in
there
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
do
let
the
pot
bile
over
and
put
it
out
and
i
see
to
the
letters
and
the
folks
and
so
she
did
and
so
i
did
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
how
said
diana
feeling
a
vague
pain
at
the
thought
of
the
post
office
that
place
where
her
hopes
had
died
somehow
there
was
a
vague
dread
in
her
heart
also
without
any
reason
wall
you
git
at
folks
secrets
if
they
have
any
miss
collins
answered
suddenly
checking
her
flow
of
words
diana
did
not
ask
again
the
subject
was
disagreeable
she
began
to
cut
up
her
parsley
deftly
with
a
sharp
knife
and
her
handmaid
stood
and
looked
at
her
some
folks
thought
you
know
at
one
time
that
masters
was
courtin
phemie
knowlton
i
did
let
on
but
la
i
knowed
it
so
why
there
war
never
a
letter
come
from
her
to
him
nor
went
from
him
to
her
she
was
here
herself
said
diana
why
should
they
write
you
could
tell
nothing
by
that
she
war
here
after
she
had
gone
away
said
miss
collins
and
that
was
jes
the
time
when
i
knowed
all
about
it
i
knowed
about
other
people
too
that
was
also
the
time
after
evan
had
quitted
pleasant
valley
yet
diana
did
not
know
why
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
trembling
if
evan
written
then
this
jemima
collins
and
her
employer
miss
gunn
would
have
known
it
and
drawn
their
conclusions
well
they
had
no
data
to
go
upon
now
bring
me
a
little
saucepan
jemima
will
you
jemima
brought
it
now
her
mistress
but
she
never
called
her
so
would
be
away
and
off
in
a
minute
or
two
more
and
leave
her
to
watch
the
saucepan
she
knew
and
her
opportunity
would
be
over
still
she
waited
to
choose
her
words
you
ai
so
fond
o
life
as
i
be
she
observed
perhaps
not
said
diana
i
do
not
think
i
should
like
a
situation
in
the
post
office
but
i
should
ha
thought
you
ha
liked
to
go
all
over
the
world
and
see
everything
now
pleasant
valley
seems
to
me
something
like
a
corner
why
did
you
why
did
i
what
said
diana
standing
up
she
had
been
stooping
down
over
her
saucepan
which
now
sat
upon
a
little
bed
of
coals
la
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
said
miss
collins
chuckling
it
no
harm
you
had
your
and
you
chose
it
only
would
have
took
the
other
the
other
what
would
you
have
taken
wall
i
don
know
said
miss
collins
to
be
sure
one
never
doos
know
till
one
is
tried
they
say
but
if
i
had
i
think
i
should
took
one
i
do
not
understand
you
said
diana
walking
off
to
the
table
where
she
began
to
gather
up
the
wrecks
of
the
parsley
stems
she
felt
an
odd
sensation
of
cold
about
the
region
of
her
heart
physically
very
disagreeable
you
are
hard
to
make
understand
then
said
miss
collins
i
suppose
you
know
you
had
two
sweethearts
do
you
and
sure
enough
you
had
the
pick
of
the
lot
likely
you
forgotten
how
dare
you
speak
so
asked
diana
not
passionately
but
with
a
sort
of
cold
despair
eying
her
handmaiden
dare
said
the
latter
dare
what
i
ai
saying
nothin
no
harm
to
have
two
beaux
you
chose
your
and
hai
no
cause
to
be
uncontented
anyhow
about
the
one
i
do
say
nothin
i
should
think
he
but
that
i
he
got
over
it
by
now
you
need
stand
and
look
he
fur
enough
off
too
your
husband
wo
be
jealous
you
knowed
you
had
two
men
after
you
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
say
that
diana
repeated
standing
as
it
were
at
bay
how
i
come
to
know
that
easy
did
i
tell
you
i
was
in
the
post
office
la
i
know
i
see
the
letters
letters
cried
diana
in
a
tone
which
forthwith
made
miss
collins
open
all
the
eyes
she
had
it
was
not
a
scream
it
was
not
even
very
loud
yet
miss
collins
went
into
a
swift
calculation
to
find
out
what
was
in
it
beyond
her
ken
happily
it
was
a
heart
yes
she
said
stolidly
i
said
letters
ai
much
else
goin
at
the
post
office
letters
and
papers
and
i
ai
one
o
them
as
sets
no
count
by
the
papers
la
what
do
i
care
for
the
news
at
washington
i
do
know
the
folks
they
may
all
die
or
get
married
for
what
i
care
but
in
pleasant
valley
i
know
where
i
be
and
i
know
who
the
folks
be
and
that
what
made
me
allays
like
to
get
a
chance
to
sort
the
letters
or
hand
out
you
never
saw
many
letters
of
mine
said
diana
turning
away
to
hide
her
lips
which
she
felt
were
growing
strange
but
she
must
speak
she
must
know
more
n
o
said
miss
collins
not
letters
o
your
writin
ef
you
mean
that
letters
of
mine
of
any
sort
i
do
get
many
letters
some
of
big
ones
when
they
come
my
did
i
use
to
wonder
what
was
in
two
stamps
and
stamps
i
makes
heavy
weight
miss
collins
laughed
a
little
two
stamps
and
three
stamps
said
diana
fiercely
how
many
were
there
i
guess
i
knowed
of
three
two
i
handed
out
o
the
box
myself
and
miss
gunn
she
said
there
was
another
there
was
no
mistakin
them
big
letters
they
was
on
soft
paper
and
lots
o
stamps
as
i
said
you
gave
them
out
who
to
to
mis
starlin
herself
i
mind
she
come
for
herself
and
she
got
you
do
mean
she
lost
on
her
way
hum
they
was
postmarked
some
queer
name
but
they
come
from
californy
i
know
that
you
hai
never
forgotten
i
heerd
it
good
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
are
on
with
the
new
but
i
never
heerd
o
folks
forgettin
their
la
no
harm
to
have
nobody
can
cast
that
up
to
ye
you
have
chosen
your
and
it
all
right
i
reckon
most
folks
would
be
proud
to
have
somebody
else
thrown
over
for
them
diana
heard
nothing
of
this
she
was
standing
deaf
and
blind
seeming
to
look
out
of
the
window
then
slowly
moved
by
some
instinct
not
reason
she
went
out
of
the
kitchen
and
crept
to
her
own
room
and
laid
herself
upon
her
bed
deaf
and
blind
she
could
neither
think
nor
feel
she
only
thought
she
knew
that
she
was
dead
the
consciousness
of
the
truth
pressed
upon
her
to
benumbing
but
she
was
utterly
unable
to
separate
points
or
look
at
the
connection
of
them
she
had
lived
and
suffered
before
now
she
was
crushed
and
dead
that
was
all
she
knew
she
could
not
even
measure
the
full
weight
of
her
misery
she
lay
too
prostrate
beneath
it
so
things
were
when
very
shortly
after
the
minister
came
in
he
had
put
up
his
horse
and
came
in
with
his
day
work
behind
him
little
parlour
was
bright
for
a
smart
fire
was
blazing
the
evenings
and
mornings
were
cool
now
in
pleasant
valley
and
the
small
table
stood
ready
for
supper
as
diana
had
left
it
she
was
probably
and
he
went
to
wash
his
hands
and
get
ready
for
the
evening
for
the
minister
was
the
neatest
man
living
there
he
found
diana
laid
upon
her
bed
where
nobody
ever
saw
her
in
the
and
furthermore
lying
with
that
nameless
something
in
all
the
lines
of
her
figure
which
is
the
expression
not
of
pain
but
of
despair
and
those
who
have
never
seen
it
before
read
it
at
first
sight
how
it
should
be
despair
of
course
the
minister
had
no
clue
to
guess
so
although
it
struck
him
with
a
sort
of
strange
chill
he
supposed
she
must
be
suffering
from
some
bodily
ailment
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
nobody
had
ever
known
diana
to
have
so
much
as
a
headache
in
her
life
until
now
her
face
was
hid
basil
went
up
softly
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
felt
so
the
slight
convulsive
shiver
that
ran
over
her
but
his
inquiries
could
get
nothing
but
monosyllables
in
return
hardly
that
rather
inarticulate
utterances
of
assent
or
dissent
to
his
questions
or
proposals
was
she
suffering
yes
what
was
the
cause
no
intelligible
answer
would
she
not
come
down
to
tea
no
would
she
have
anything
no
could
he
do
anything
for
her
no
diana
said
her
husband
tenderly
is
it
bad
news
there
was
a
pause
and
he
waited
just
go
down
she
managed
with
great
difficulty
to
say
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
come
by
and
by
i
just
lie
still
a
little
she
had
not
shown
her
face
and
the
minister
quietly
withdrew
feeling
that
here
was
more
than
appeared
on
the
surface
there
was
enough
appearing
on
the
surface
to
make
him
uneasy
and
he
paid
no
attention
to
miss
collins
who
brought
in
the
supper
and
bustled
about
rather
more
than
was
necessary
do
ring
the
bell
jemima
masters
said
masters
is
not
coming
down
miss
collins
went
on
to
make
the
tea
that
was
always
diana
business
what
ails
her
she
asked
abruptly
you
ought
to
know
said
the
minister
what
did
she
complain
of
complain
echoed
the
handmaiden
she
was
as
well
as
you
be
not
five
minutes
afore
you
come
in
how
do
you
know
guess
i
had
ought
to
why
she
was
in
the
kitchen
talkin
and
with
them
eggs
she
thinks
i
ai
up
to
there
war
nothin
on
earth
the
matter
with
her
then
she
had
sot
the
table
in
here
and
fixed
up
the
fire
and
then
she
come
in
to
the
kitchen
and
went
to
work
at
the
supper
there
ai
never
nothin
the
matter
with
her
the
minister
made
no
sort
of
remark
nor
put
any
further
inquiry
nor
looked
even
curious
miss
collins
however
her
brain
got
into
a
sudden
confusion
of
possibilities
pouring
out
the
tea
she
stood
by
the
table
reflecting
what
she
should
say
next
i
guess
she
mad
at
me
she
began
slowly
or
maybe
she
afeard
you
be
mad
with
her
la
nothin
i
told
her
you
never
be
jealous
no
harm
for
a
girl
to
have
two
beaus
is
it
the
minister
gave
her
a
quick
look
from
under
his
brows
and
replied
calmly
that
he
supposed
not
wall
i
told
her
so
and
now
she
put
out
i
knowed
o
them
letters
la
folks
that
has
the
post
office
ca
help
but
know
more
what
concerns
their
than
other
folks
doos
i
handled
them
myself
you
see
and
handed
them
out
leastways
two
o
them
that
war
no
fault
o
mine
nor
of
anybody
la
she
need
to
mind
how
much
tea
did
you
put
in
jemima
i
do
know
masters
i
put
in
a
pinch
masters
had
ought
to
ha
been
here
to
make
it
herself
she
knows
how
you
like
it
i
like
more
than
such
a
pinch
as
this
was
if
you
will
empty
the
i
will
make
a
cup
for
myself
that
will
do
thank
you
left
alone
masters
sat
for
a
little
while
with
his
head
on
his
hand
neglecting
the
supper
then
he
roused
himself
and
went
on
to
make
some
fresh
tea
and
very
carefully
and
nicely
he
made
it
poured
out
a
cup
and
prepared
it
put
it
on
a
little
tray
then
and
carried
it
steaming
and
fragrant
up
to
his
wife
room
diana
was
lying
just
as
he
had
left
her
masters
shut
the
door
and
came
to
the
bedside
di
said
he
gently
i
have
brought
you
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
neither
answer
nor
movement
he
repeated
his
words
she
murmured
an
unintelligible
rejection
of
the
proposal
keeping
her
face
carefully
covered
no
said
he
i
think
you
had
better
take
it
lift
up
your
head
di
and
try
it
is
good
the
tone
was
tender
and
quiet
nevertheless
diana
had
known
masters
long
enough
to
be
assured
that
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
thing
there
was
no
bringing
him
off
it
she
would
have
to
take
the
tea
and
as
he
put
his
hand
under
her
head
to
lift
her
up
she
suffered
him
to
do
it
then
he
saw
her
face
only
by
the
light
of
a
candle
it
is
true
but
that
revealed
more
than
enough
so
wan
so
deathly
pale
so
dark
in
the
lines
round
the
eyes
and
those
indescribable
shadows
which
mental
pain
brings
into
a
face
that
her
husband
heart
sank
down
no
small
matter
easy
to
blow
away
had
brought
his
strong
beautiful
diana
to
look
like
that
but
his
face
showed
nothing
though
indeed
she
never
looked
at
it
and
his
voice
was
clear
and
gentle
just
as
usual
in
the
few
words
he
said
he
held
the
cup
to
her
lips
and
after
she
had
drank
the
tea
and
lay
down
again
he
passed
his
hand
once
or
twice
with
a
tender
touch
over
her
brow
and
the
disordered
hair
then
with
no
more
questions
or
remarks
he
took
away
the
candle
and
the
empty
cup
and
diana
saw
him
no
more
that
night
chapter
xxvi
things
undone
the
slept
peacefully
till
morning
nobody
else
diana
did
not
keep
awake
it
is
true
she
was
at
that
dull
stage
of
misery
when
something
like
stupor
comes
over
the
brain
she
slumbered
heavily
from
time
to
time
nature
does
claim
such
a
privilege
sometimes
it
was
basil
who
watched
the
night
through
watched
and
prayed
there
was
no
stupor
in
his
thoughts
he
had
a
very
full
though
vague
realization
of
great
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
both
he
was
very
near
the
truth
too
after
an
hour
or
two
of
pondering
putting
miss
collins
hints
diana
own
former
confessions
and
her
present
condition
together
he
saw
clearer
than
it
was
good
to
see
the
probable
state
of
affairs
and
yet
he
was
glad
to
see
it
if
any
help
or
bettering
was
ever
to
come
it
was
desirable
that
his
vision
should
be
true
and
his
wisdom
have
at
least
firm
data
to
act
upon
but
what
action
could
touch
the
case
the
most
difficult
that
a
man
can
have
to
deal
with
through
the
night
basil
alternately
walked
the
floor
and
knelt
down
sometimes
at
his
study
table
sometimes
before
the
open
window
where
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
could
read
signs
of
that
invisible
sympathy
he
was
seeking
the
air
was
a
little
frosty
but
very
still
he
kept
up
a
fire
in
his
chimney
and
basil
was
not
one
of
those
ministers
who
live
in
perpetual
terror
about
draughts
it
was
a
comfort
to
him
to
look
off
and
away
from
earth
even
though
he
could
not
see
into
heaven
the
stars
were
witnesses
to
him
and
for
him
in
their
eternal
calmness
he
calleth
them
all
by
their
names
for
that
he
is
strong
in
power
not
one
faileth
why
sayest
thou
o
jacob
and
speakest
o
israel
my
way
is
hid
from
the
lord
and
my
judgment
is
passed
over
from
my
god
and
in
answer
to
the
unspoken
cry
of
appeal
that
burst
forth
as
he
knelt
there
by
the
window
o
lord
my
strength
my
fortress
and
my
refuge
in
the
day
of
affliction
came
the
unspoken
promise
the
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
removed
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed
saith
the
lord
that
hath
mercy
on
thee
the
minister
had
something
such
a
night
of
it
as
jacob
had
before
his
meeting
with
esau
with
the
difference
that
there
was
no
lameness
left
the
next
morning
before
the
dawn
came
up
when
the
stars
were
fading
basil
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
in
his
study
and
went
into
a
sleep
as
deep
and
peaceful
as
his
sleeps
were
wont
to
be
and
when
he
rose
up
after
some
hours
he
was
entirely
himself
again
refreshed
and
restored
and
ready
for
duty
neither
could
anybody
that
day
or
afterwards
see
the
slightest
change
in
him
from
what
he
had
been
before
he
went
out
and
attended
to
his
horse
the
minister
always
did
that
himself
then
came
in
and
changed
his
dress
and
went
through
his
morning
toilet
with
the
usual
dainty
care
then
he
went
in
to
see
diana
she
had
awaked
at
last
out
of
her
slumberous
stupor
sorry
to
see
the
light
and
know
that
it
was
day
again
another
day
why
should
there
be
another
day
for
her
what
use
why
could
she
not
die
and
be
out
of
her
trouble
another
day
and
now
would
come
had
come
the
duties
of
it
how
was
she
to
meet
them
how
could
she
do
them
life
energy
was
gone
she
was
dead
how
was
she
to
play
the
part
of
the
living
and
among
the
living
what
mockery
and
basil
what
would
become
of
him
as
for
evan
diana
dared
not
so
much
in
her
thoughts
as
even
to
glance
his
way
she
had
risen
half
up
in
bed
she
had
not
undressed
at
all
and
was
sitting
with
her
arms
slung
round
her
knees
gazing
at
the
daylight
and
wondering
vaguely
about
all
these
things
when
the
door
between
the
rooms
swung
lightly
open
if
she
had
dared
diana
would
have
crouched
down
and
hid
her
face
again
she
was
afraid
to
do
that
she
sat
stolidly
still
gazing
out
at
the
window
look
at
basil
she
could
not
his
approach
filled
her
with
so
great
a
feeling
of
repulsion
that
she
would
have
liked
to
spring
from
the
bed
and
flee
anywhere
away
and
away
where
she
would
see
him
no
more
no
such
flight
was
possible
she
sat
motionless
and
stared
at
the
window
keeping
down
the
internal
shiver
which
ran
over
her
basil
came
with
his
light
quick
step
and
stood
beside
her
took
her
hand
and
felt
her
pulse
you
are
not
feeling
very
well
di
he
said
gravely
well
enough
said
diana
i
will
get
up
and
be
down
presently
will
you
said
he
now
i
think
you
had
better
not
the
best
thing
you
can
do
will
be
to
lie
still
here
and
keep
quiet
all
day
may
i
prescribe
for
you
yes
i
will
do
what
you
please
said
diana
she
never
looked
at
him
and
he
knew
it
then
this
is
what
i
think
you
had
better
do
get
up
and
take
a
bath
then
put
on
your
and
lie
down
again
you
shall
have
your
breakfast
up
here
and
i
will
let
nobody
come
up
to
disturb
you
i
not
hungry
i
do
want
anything
you
are
a
little
feverish
but
you
will
be
better
for
taking
something
now
you
get
your
bath
and
i
attend
to
the
breakfast
he
kissed
her
brow
gravely
guessing
that
she
would
rather
he
did
not
but
knowing
nevertheless
that
he
might
and
must
for
he
was
her
husband
and
however
gladly
she
and
unselfishly
he
would
have
broken
the
relation
between
them
it
subsisted
and
could
not
be
broken
and
then
he
went
where
mis
masters
demanded
jemima
when
she
brought
in
the
standing
attention
not
coming
down
ai
anything
ails
her
is
there
yes
but
i
do
know
how
serious
give
me
the
kettle
jemima
i
told
her
to
lie
still
and
that
i
would
bring
her
a
cup
of
tea
i
take
it
up
masters
and
you
can
eat
your
breakfast
thank
you
i
always
like
to
keep
my
promises
fetch
in
the
kettle
jemima
jemima
dared
not
but
obey
so
when
diana
between
dead
and
alive
had
done
as
she
was
bid
taken
her
bath
and
wrapped
in
her
was
laid
upon
her
bed
again
her
husband
made
his
appearance
with
a
little
tray
and
the
tea
there
had
been
a
certain
bodily
refreshment
about
the
bath
and
the
change
of
dress
but
with
that
little
touch
of
the
everyday
work
of
life
there
had
come
such
a
rebellion
against
life
in
general
and
all
that
it
held
that
diana
was
nearly
desperate
in
place
of
dull
despair
had
come
a
wild
repulsion
against
everything
that
was
left
her
in
the
world
and
yet
the
girl
knew
that
she
would
neither
die
nor
go
mad
but
must
just
live
and
bear
she
looked
at
basil
and
his
tray
with
a
sort
of
impatient
horror
i
do
want
anything
she
said
i
do
want
anything
try
the
tea
it
is
out
of
the
green
chest
diana
had
learned
as
i
said
to
know
her
husband
pretty
well
and
she
knew
that
though
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
was
very
quiet
and
for
all
a
certain
sweet
insistence
in
it
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
urging
nevertheless
there
was
under
it
something
to
which
she
must
yield
his
will
never
had
clashed
with
hers
once
nevertheless
diana
had
seen
and
known
that
whatever
basil
wanted
to
do
with
anybody
he
did
everybody
granted
it
to
him
somehow
so
did
she
now
she
raised
herself
up
and
tasted
the
tea
eat
a
biscuit
i
do
want
it
i
do
want
anything
basil
you
must
eat
something
though
said
he
it
is
bad
enough
for
me
to
have
to
carry
along
with
me
all
day
the
thought
of
you
lying
here
i
can
not
bear
in
addition
the
thought
of
you
starving
o
no
i
am
not
starving
diana
answered
and
unable
to
endure
to
look
at
him
or
talk
to
him
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
leaning
it
down
upon
her
knees
basil
did
not
say
anything
nor
did
he
go
away
he
stood
beside
her
with
an
outflow
of
compassion
in
his
heart
but
waiting
patiently
at
last
touched
her
smooth
hair
with
his
hand
di
said
he
gently
look
up
and
take
something
she
hastily
removed
her
hands
raised
her
head
swallowed
the
tea
and
managed
to
swallow
the
biscuit
with
it
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
brow
as
he
had
done
last
night
now
lie
down
and
rest
said
he
i
must
ride
over
to
blackberry
hill
again
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
may
be
kept
there
i
will
tell
jemima
to
let
no
visitors
come
up
to
bother
you
lie
still
and
rest
i
will
give
you
a
pillow
for
your
thoughts
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
i
make
my
refuge
until
these
calamities
be
overpast
he
went
away
and
diana
covered
her
face
again
she
could
not
bear
the
light
her
whole
nature
was
in
uproar
the
bath
and
dressing
the
tea
her
husband
presence
and
words
his
last
words
especially
had
roused
her
from
her
stupor
and
given
her
as
it
were
a
scale
with
which
to
measure
the
full
burden
of
her
misery
there
was
no
item
wanting
diana
thought
to
make
it
utterly
immeasurable
and
unbearable
if
she
had
married
a
less
good
man
it
would
have
been
less
hard
to
spoil
all
his
hopes
of
happiness
if
he
had
been
a
weaker
man
she
would
not
have
cared
about
him
at
all
if
any
hand
but
her
own
mother
had
dashed
her
cup
of
happiness
out
of
her
hand
she
would
have
had
there
a
refuge
to
go
to
most
girls
have
their
mothers
if
evan
had
not
been
sent
to
so
distant
a
post
but
when
her
thoughts
dared
turn
to
evan
diana
writhed
upon
her
bed
in
tearless
agony
evan
writing
in
all
the
freshness
and
strength
of
his
love
and
his
trust
in
her
those
letters
waiting
and
looking
for
her
answer
writing
again
and
again
disappointed
all
the
while
and
at
last
obliged
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
faith
in
her
and
that
her
love
had
been
a
sham
or
a
fancy
what
had
he
not
suffered
on
her
account
even
as
she
had
suffered
for
him
but
that
he
should
think
so
of
her
was
not
to
be
borne
she
would
write
might
she
write
from
hiding
her
head
on
her
pillow
diana
sat
bolt
upright
now
and
stared
at
the
light
as
if
it
could
tell
her
might
she
write
to
evan
just
once
this
once
to
tell
him
how
it
had
been
would
that
be
any
wrong
against
her
husband
would
basil
have
any
right
to
forbid
her
the
uneasy
sense
of
doubt
here
was
met
by
a
furious
rebellion
against
any
authority
that
would
interfere
with
her
doing
herself
as
she
said
so
much
justice
and
giving
herself
and
evan
so
much
miserable
comfort
could
there
be
a
right
to
hinder
her
suppose
she
were
to
ask
basil
but
what
disclosures
that
would
involve
would
he
bear
them
or
could
she
better
write
without
his
knowledge
then
on
the
other
hand
basil
was
so
upright
himself
so
true
and
faithful
and
trusted
her
so
completely
no
she
never
could
deceive
his
trust
not
if
she
died
o
that
she
could
die
but
diana
knew
that
she
was
not
going
to
die
suppose
she
charged
her
mother
with
what
she
had
done
and
get
to
write
and
confess
it
a
likely
thing
that
starling
would
be
wrought
upon
to
make
such
a
humiliation
of
herself
she
was
forced
to
give
up
that
thought
and
indeed
she
was
not
clear
about
the
essential
distinction
between
communicating
directly
herself
with
evan
and
getting
another
to
do
it
for
her
and
what
had
been
motive
in
keeping
back
the
letters
but
diana
knew
her
mother
and
that
problem
did
not
detain
her
long
for
hours
and
hours
diana
mind
was
like
a
stormy
sea
where
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
were
not
wanting
any
more
than
the
wind
once
in
a
while
like
the
faint
blink
of
a
through
the
clouds
came
an
echo
of
the
words
basil
had
quoted
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
i
make
my
refuge
but
they
hurt
her
so
that
she
fled
from
them
the
contrast
of
their
peace
with
her
turmoil
of
their
intense
sweetness
with
the
bitter
passion
which
was
wasting
her
heart
the
hint
of
that
harbour
for
the
vessel
which
could
only
be
entered
she
knew
by
striking
sail
all
that
was
unbearable
i
suppose
there
was
a
whisper
of
conscience
too
which
said
strike
sail
and
go
in
while
passion
would
not
take
down
an
inch
of
canvas
not
she
said
to
herself
could
she
submit
to
have
things
be
as
they
were
submit
and
be
quiet
and
accept
them
and
go
her
way
accepting
them
and
put
the
thought
of
evan
away
and
live
the
rest
of
her
life
as
though
he
had
no
existence
that
was
the
counsel
basil
would
give
she
had
an
unrecognised
consciousness
and
for
the
present
pain
was
easier
to
bear
than
that
and
now
memory
flew
back
over
the
years
and
took
up
again
the
thread
of
her
relations
with
evan
and
traced
them
to
their
beginning
and
went
over
all
the
ground
going
back
and
forward
recalling
every
meeting
and
reviewing
every
one
of
those
too
scanty
hours
for
a
long
while
she
had
not
been
able
to
do
this
because
evan
she
thought
had
been
faithless
and
in
that
case
she
really
never
had
had
what
she
thought
she
had
in
him
now
she
knew
he
was
not
faithless
and
she
had
got
the
time
and
him
back
again
and
she
in
a
sort
revelled
in
the
consciousness
and
with
that
came
then
the
thought
too
late
she
had
got
him
again
only
to
see
an
impassable
barrier
set
between
which
must
keep
them
apart
for
ever
and
that
barrier
was
her
husband
what
the
thought
of
basil
or
rather
what
his
image
was
to
diana
that
day
it
is
difficult
to
tell
she
shunned
it
whenever
it
appeared
with
an
intolerable
mingling
of
contradictory
feelings
her
fate
and
yet
more
like
a
good
angel
to
her
than
anybody
that
had
ever
crossed
the
line
of
her
path
the
destroyer
of
her
hope
and
joy
for
ever
and
yet
one
to
whom
she
was
bound
and
to
whom
she
owed
all
possible
duty
and
affection
she
wished
it
were
possible
never
to
see
him
again
in
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
not
another
in
the
world
of
whom
she
believed
all
the
good
she
believed
of
him
his
image
was
dreadful
to
her
basil
was
the
very
of
her
agonized
struggles
that
day
to
be
parted
from
evan
she
could
have
borne
if
she
might
have
devoted
herself
to
the
memory
of
him
and
lived
in
quiet
sorrow
but
to
put
this
man
in
his
place
to
belong
to
him
to
be
his
wife
in
proportion
to
the
strength
and
health
of
diana
nature
was
the
power
of
her
realization
and
the
force
of
her
will
but
also
the
possibility
of
endurance
the
internal
fight
would
have
broken
down
a
less
pure
and
sound
bodily
organization
it
was
characteristic
of
this
natural
soundness
and
sweetness
which
was
mental
as
well
as
physical
that
her
mother
part
in
the
events
which
had
destroyed
her
happiness
had
very
little
of
her
attention
that
day
she
thought
of
it
with
a
kind
of
sore
wonder
and
astonishment
in
which
resentment
had
almost
no
share
o
mother
mother
she
said
in
her
heart
but
she
said
no
more
miss
collins
came
up
once
or
twice
to
see
her
but
diana
lay
quiet
and
was
able
to
baffle
curiosity
are
ye
goin
to
git
up
and
come
down
to
supper
the
handmaid
asked
in
the
second
visit
which
occurred
late
in
the
afternoon
i
do
know
i
shall
do
what
masters
says
you
do
look
as
ef
there
was
much
ailin
you
and
yet
you
look
kind
o
queer
too
i
should
wonder
a
bit
ef
you
was
a
gettin
a
fever
there
a
red
spot
on
one
of
your
cheeks
that
like
fire
one
pale
enough
you
must
be
in
a
fever
i
guess
or
you
could
lie
here
with
the
window
open
leave
it
open
and
just
let
me
be
quiet
miss
collins
went
down
marvelling
to
herself
but
when
basil
came
home
he
found
the
flush
spread
to
both
cheeks
and
a
look
in
diana
eyes
that
he
did
not
like
how
has
the
day
been
he
asked
passing
his
hand
over
the
flushed
cheek
and
the
disordered
hair
diana
shrank
and
shivered
and
did
not
answer
he
felt
her
pulse
diana
said
he
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
stared
at
him
in
the
utter
difficulty
of
answering
basil
she
began
and
stopped
not
finding
another
word
to
add
for
prevarication
was
an
accomplishment
diana
knew
nothing
of
she
closed
her
eyes
that
they
might
not
see
the
figure
standing
there
would
you
like
me
to
fetch
your
mother
to
you
no
she
said
starting
o
no
do
bring
her
basil
i
will
not
said
he
kindly
why
should
she
not
come
mother
never
never
never
not
mother
i
ca
bear
her
said
diana
strangely
masters
went
looking
very
grave
he
took
his
supper
for
he
needed
it
and
then
he
carried
up
a
cup
of
tea
fresh
made
to
diana
she
drank
it
this
time
eagerly
but
there
was
no
lightening
of
his
grave
brow
when
he
carried
the
cup
down
again
something
was
very
much
the
matter
he
knew
now
as
he
had
feared
it
last
night
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
had
better
try
to
find
out
just
what
it
was
miss
collins
by
a
judicious
system
of
suggestion
and
inquiry
might
be
led
perhaps
to
reveal
something
without
knowing
that
she
revealed
anything
but
the
minister
disliked
that
way
of
getting
information
when
it
could
be
dispensed
with
he
had
enough
knowledge
to
act
upon
for
the
rest
he
was
patient
and
could
wait
that
night
he
knew
diana
did
not
sleep
he
himself
passed
the
night
again
in
his
study
though
not
in
the
struggles
of
the
night
before
he
was
very
calm
stedfast
diligent
that
is
his
usual
self
entirely
and
watching
her
without
her
knowing
he
watched
he
knew
by
her
breathing
and
her
changes
of
position
that
it
was
a
night
of
no
rest
on
her
part
once
he
saw
she
was
sitting
up
in
the
bed
once
he
saw
that
she
had
left
it
and
was
sitting
by
the
window
the
next
day
the
minister
did
not
leave
home
he
had
no
more
urgent
business
anywhere
he
thought
than
there
and
he
found
diana
did
not
make
up
by
day
what
she
had
lost
by
night
she
was
always
staring
wide
awake
whenever
he
went
into
the
room
and
he
went
whenever
there
was
a
cup
of
tea
or
a
cup
of
broth
to
be
taken
to
her
for
he
prepared
it
and
carried
it
to
her
himself
it
happened
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
that
prince
and
the
old
little
green
waggon
came
jogging
along
and
landed
starling
at
the
minister
door
this
was
a
very
rare
event
starling
came
at
long
intervals
to
see
her
daughter
and
made
then
a
call
which
nobody
enjoyed
miss
collins
hailed
the
sight
of
her
indeed
if
the
distance
had
not
been
too
much
miss
collins
would
have
walked
down
to
carry
the
tidings
of
diana
indisposition
for
like
a
true
gossip
she
scented
mischief
where
she
could
see
none
the
minister
would
let
her
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
wife
and
if
he
were
out
of
the
house
and
she
got
a
chance
she
could
make
nothing
of
diana
nothing
certain
but
nothing
either
that
lulled
her
suspicions
now
with
starling
there
was
no
telling
what
she
might
get
at
the
lady
dismounted
and
came
into
the
kitchen
looking
about
her
as
always
with
sharp
eyes
how
d
do
said
she
where
is
diana
i
glad
to
see
ye
mis
starling
and
that
a
fact
said
the
handmaid
i
was
a
mind
to
walk
down
to
your
place
what
the
matter
where
diana
wall
she
she
hai
been
down
now
for
two
days
what
the
reason
wall
ai
right
and
i
do
think
the
minister
clear
what
it
is
and
ai
she
was
took
as
sudden
you
never
see
nothin
suddener
she
come
in
here
to
fix
a
dish
o
eggs
for
supper
that
she
mighty
particler
about
and
do
think
no
one
can
cook
eggs
but
herself
and
i
was
talkin
and
tellin
her
about
my
old
experiences
in
the
post
office
and
she
went
and
took
to
her
bed
and
she
hai
left
it
now
ai
that
queer
she
did
say
ailed
her
not
a
word
only
she
went
up
and
took
to
her
bed
and
she
doos
look
queer
at
you
that
i
will
say
mebbe
it
fever
a
comin
on
there
was
a
minute
or
two
silence
starling
did
not
immediately
find
her
tongue
what
have
the
post
office
and
your
stories
got
to
do
with
it
she
asked
harshly
i
should
like
to
know
yes
said
miss
collins
drawing
out
the
word
with
affable
intonation
that
what
beats
me
what
should
they
but
la
the
post
office
is
queer
that
what
i
always
said
everybody
gits
into
it
and
ef
you
there
o
course
you
ca
help
knowin
things
you
were
in
the
post
office
said
starling
it
was
none
of
business
war
i
said
miss
collins
do
you
mind
that
starling
i
mind
you
comin
and
i
mind
givin
you
your
letters
too
i
mind
some
big
ones
that
had
stamps
enough
on
to
set
up
a
shop
la
no
harm
miss
gunn
she
used
to
feel
a
sort
o
sameness
about
allays
takin
in
and
givin
out
and
then
she
come
into
the
kitchen
and
make
cake
mebbe
and
send
me
to
the
letters
and
the
folks
and
then
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
me
do
you
never
git
tired
o
trottin
a
mile
in
a
bushel
mis
starlin
so
i
was
jest
a
tellin
diany
where
the
minister
most
likely
he
where
she
is
he
wo
let
nobody
else
do
a
hand
turn
for
her
he
takes
up
every
cup
of
tea
and
he
spreads
every
bit
of
bread
and
butter
and
he
tastes
the
broths
you
think
he
was
anythin
in
the
world
but
a
minister
he
tastes
the
broth
and
he
calls
for
the
salt
and
pepper
and
he
stirs
and
he
tastes
and
then
you
never
see
a
man
make
such
a
fuss
leastways
never
did
he
have
a
white
napkin
and
spread
over
a
tray
and
the
cup
on
it
and
saucer
too
for
he
wo
have
the
cup
the
saucer
and
then
carry
it
was
your
husband
like
that
mis
starling
he
was
a
minister
i
heerd
tell
starling
turned
short
about
without
answering
and
went
she
found
the
minister
there
as
miss
collins
had
opined
she
would
but
she
paid
little
attention
to
him
he
was
just
drawing
the
curtains
over
a
window
where
the
sunlight
came
in
too
glaringly
as
he
had
done
this
and
turned
he
was
a
spectator
of
the
meeting
between
mother
and
child
it
was
peculiar
starling
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
came
no
nearer
but
stood
there
looking
down
at
her
daughter
and
diana
eyes
fastened
on
hers
with
a
look
of
calm
cold
intelligence
it
was
intense
enough
yet
there
was
no
passion
in
it
i
suppose
there
was
too
much
despair
however
it
was
as
i
said
keen
and
intent
and
it
held
starling
eye
like
a
vice
those
masters
could
not
see
the
lady
back
was
towards
him
but
he
saw
how
diana
eyes
pinioned
her
and
how
strangely
still
starling
stood
what
the
matter
with
you
she
said
harshly
at
last
you
ought
to
know
said
diana
not
moving
her
eyes
i
ai
a
conjuror
starling
returned
with
a
sort
of
snort
what
makes
you
look
at
me
like
that
diana
gave
a
short
sharp
laugh
how
can
you
look
at
me
she
said
i
know
all
about
it
mother
starling
with
a
sudden
determination
went
round
to
the
head
of
the
bed
and
put
out
her
hand
to
feel
diana
pulse
diana
shrank
away
from
her
keep
off
she
cried
basil
basil
do
let
her
touch
me
she
is
out
of
her
head
said
starling
turning
to
her
and
speaking
half
loud
i
had
better
stay
and
sit
up
with
her
no
cried
diana
i
do
want
you
basil
do
let
her
stay
basil
basil
the
cry
was
urgent
and
pitiful
her
husband
came
near
arranged
the
pillows
for
she
had
started
half
up
and
putting
her
gently
back
upon
them
said
in
his
calm
tones
be
quiet
di
you
command
here
starling
shall
we
go
starling
this
time
complied
without
making
any
objection
but
as
she
reached
the
bottom
she
gave
vent
to
her
opinion
you
are
spoiling
her
really
i
should
like
to
have
the
chance
what
do
you
mean
by
that
just
the
words
i
should
like
to
spoil
di
she
has
never
had
much
of
that
sort
of
bad
influence
that
sounds
very
weak
to
me
said
starling
to
whom
should
a
man
show
himself
weak
if
not
toward
his
wife
said
basil
carelessly
your
wife
will
not
thank
you
for
it
i
will
endeavour
to
retain
her
respect
said
basil
in
the
same
way
which
aggravated
starling
beyond
bounds
something
about
him
always
did
try
her
temper
she
said
to
herself
diana
is
going
to
have
a
fever
she
spoke
abruptly
i
am
afraid
of
it
what
brought
it
on
i
came
home
two
evenings
ago
and
found
her
on
the
bed
you
do
want
me
you
say
who
do
you
expect
is
going
to
sit
up
with
her
and
take
care
of
her
i
will
try
what
i
can
do
for
the
present
you
ca
manage
that
and
your
work
too
i
will
manage
said
basil
significantly
and
let
your
parish
work
go
well
i
always
thought
a
minister
was
bound
to
attend
to
his
people
yes
is
my
wife
more
one
of
my
people
than
anybody
else
will
you
stay
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
mrs
starling
no
if
you
do
want
me
i
am
going
what
will
you
do
if
diana
gets
delirious
i
think
she
out
of
her
head
now
i
attend
to
her
said
basil
composedly
half
suspecting
a
double
meaning
in
his
words
starling
took
short
leave
and
drove
off
not
quite
easy
in
her
mind
if
the
truth
be
told
and
glad
to
be
out
of
all
patience
with
the
minister
yes
if
she
had
known
how
things
would
turn
if
she
had
known
perhaps
she
would
not
have
thrown
that
first
letter
into
the
fire
which
had
drawn
her
on
to
throw
the
second
in
and
the
third
could
any
could
evan
knowlton
at
least
have
been
more
untoward
for
her
wishes
than
the
one
she
had
got
more
unmanageable
he
could
not
have
been
nor
more
likely
to
be
spooney
about
diana
and
now
what
if
diana
really
should
have
a
fever
people
talk
out
in
delirium
well
the
minister
would
keep
his
own
counsel
she
did
not
care
she
said
but
all
the
same
she
did
care
and
she
would
fain
have
been
the
only
one
to
receive
revelations
if
she
could
have
managed
it
and
by
what
conjuration
had
the
truth
come
to
be
revealed
when
only
the
fire
and
she
knew
anything
about
it
starling
chewed
the
cud
of
no
sweet
fancy
on
her
road
home
chapter
xxvii
bonds
diana
did
become
a
few
days
of
such
brain
work
as
she
had
endured
that
first
hours
were
too
much
even
for
her
perfect
organization
she
fell
into
a
low
fever
which
at
times
threatened
to
become
violent
yet
never
did
she
was
delirious
often
and
basil
heard
quite
enough
of
her
unconscious
revelations
to
put
him
in
full
possession
of
the
situation
in
different
portions
diana
went
over
the
whole
ground
he
knew
sometimes
that
she
was
walking
with
evan
taking
leave
of
him
perhaps
taking
counsel
with
him
and
forming
plans
for
life
then
wondering
at
his
silence
speculating
about
ways
and
distances
tracing
his
letters
out
of
the
post
office
into
the
wrong
hand
and
when
she
was
upon
that
strain
diana
would
break
out
into
a
cry
of
o
mother
mother
mother
repeating
the
word
with
an
accent
of
such
plaintive
despair
that
it
tore
the
heart
of
the
one
who
heard
it
there
was
only
one
as
long
as
this
state
of
things
lasted
basil
gave
himself
up
to
the
single
task
of
watching
and
nursing
his
wife
and
amid
the
many
varieties
of
which
people
know
in
this
world
that
which
he
tasted
these
weeks
was
one
of
refined
bitterness
he
came
to
know
just
how
things
were
and
just
how
they
had
been
all
along
he
knew
what
diana
patient
or
reticent
calm
covered
he
heard
sometimes
her
fond
moanings
over
another
name
sometimes
her
passionate
outcries
the
owner
of
that
name
to
come
and
deliver
her
sometimes
she
revealed
that
too
even
the
repulsion
with
which
she
regarded
himself
o
not
this
man
she
said
one
night
when
he
had
been
sitting
by
her
and
hoping
that
she
was
more
quiet
o
not
this
man
it
was
a
mistake
it
was
all
a
mistake
people
ought
to
take
better
care
at
the
post
office
tell
evan
i
did
know
but
i
come
to
him
now
just
as
soon
as
i
can
another
time
she
burst
out
more
violently
do
kiss
me
she
exclaimed
do
touch
me
i
wo
bear
it
never
again
i
belong
to
somebody
else
do
you
know
you
have
no
business
to
be
here
basil
was
not
near
her
indeed
she
would
not
have
recognised
him
if
he
had
been
he
was
sitting
by
the
fire
at
a
distance
but
he
knew
whom
she
was
addressing
in
her
mournful
ravings
and
his
heart
and
courage
almost
gave
way
it
was
very
bitter
and
many
an
hour
of
those
nights
the
minister
spent
on
his
knees
at
the
bed
foot
seeking
for
strength
and
wisdom
seeking
to
keep
his
heart
from
being
quite
broken
striving
to
know
what
to
do
should
he
do
as
she
said
and
never
kiss
her
again
should
he
behave
to
her
in
the
future
as
a
mere
stranger
what
was
best
for
him
and
for
her
basil
would
have
done
that
unflinchingly
though
it
had
led
him
to
the
stake
if
he
could
know
what
the
best
was
but
he
did
not
quite
give
up
all
hope
desperate
as
the
case
looked
his
own
strong
cheerful
nature
and
his
faith
in
god
kept
him
up
and
he
resolutely
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
the
best
way
nor
the
hopefulest
for
him
and
diana
bound
to
each
other
as
they
were
to
try
to
live
as
strangers
the
bond
could
not
be
broken
it
had
better
be
acknowledged
by
them
both
but
if
basil
could
have
broken
it
and
set
her
free
he
would
have
done
it
at
any
cost
to
himself
so
week
after
week
he
kept
his
post
as
nurse
at
diana
side
he
was
a
capital
nurse
untireable
as
a
man
and
tender
as
a
woman
quick
as
a
woman
too
to
read
signs
and
answer
unspoken
wishes
thoughtful
as
many
women
are
not
patient
with
an
unending
patience
diana
was
herself
at
times
and
recognised
all
this
and
by
degrees
as
the
slow
days
wore
away
her
disorder
wore
away
too
or
wore
itself
out
and
she
came
back
to
her
normal
condition
in
all
except
strength
that
was
very
failing
even
after
the
fever
was
gone
and
still
basil
kept
his
post
he
began
now
it
is
true
to
attend
to
some
pressing
outside
duties
for
which
in
the
weeks
just
past
he
had
provided
a
substitute
but
morning
noon
and
night
he
was
at
diana
side
no
hand
but
his
own
might
ever
carry
to
her
the
meals
which
his
own
hand
had
no
inconsiderable
share
in
preparing
he
knew
how
to
serve
an
invalid
breakfast
with
a
refinement
of
care
which
diana
herself
before
that
would
not
have
known
how
to
give
another
though
she
appreciated
it
and
took
her
lesson
then
nobody
could
so
nicely
and
deftly
prop
up
pillows
and
cushions
so
as
to
make
her
rest
comfortably
for
the
taking
of
the
meal
no
one
had
such
skilful
strength
to
enable
a
weak
person
to
change
his
position
for
all
other
things
diana
saw
no
difference
in
him
nothing
told
her
that
she
had
betrayed
herself
and
she
betrayed
herself
no
more
dull
and
listless
she
might
be
that
was
natural
enough
in
her
weak
state
of
convalescence
and
diana
had
never
been
demonstrative
towards
her
husband
it
was
no
new
thing
that
she
was
not
demonstrative
now
neither
did
he
betray
that
he
knew
all
she
was
trying
poor
child
to
hide
from
him
he
was
just
as
usual
only
in
diana
present
helpless
condition
he
had
opportunity
to
show
tenderness
and
care
in
a
thousand
services
which
in
her
well
days
she
would
have
dispensed
with
and
he
did
it
as
i
said
with
the
strength
of
a
man
and
the
delicacy
of
a
woman
he
let
nobody
else
do
anything
for
her
did
he
guess
how
gladly
she
would
have
escaped
from
all
his
ministrations
did
he
knew
what
they
were
to
diana
probably
not
for
with
all
his
fineness
of
perception
he
was
yet
a
man
and
i
suppose
reverse
the
conditions
there
never
was
a
man
yet
who
would
object
to
have
one
woman
wait
upon
him
because
he
loved
another
yet
basil
did
know
partly
and
partly
guess
and
he
went
patiently
on
in
the
way
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
upheld
by
principle
and
by
a
great
tenacity
of
purpose
which
was
part
of
his
character
nevertheless
those
were
days
of
pain
great
and
terrible
even
for
him
what
they
were
to
diana
he
could
but
partially
divine
as
health
slowly
came
back
and
she
looked
at
herself
and
her
life
again
with
eyes
unveiled
by
disease
with
the
pitiless
clearness
of
sound
reason
diana
wished
she
could
die
she
knew
she
could
not
she
could
come
no
nearer
to
it
than
a
passing
thought
her
pulses
were
retaking
their
sweet
regularity
her
nerves
were
strung
again
fine
and
true
only
muscular
strength
seemed
to
tarry
lying
there
on
her
bed
and
looking
out
over
the
fields
for
it
was
by
this
time
diana
sometimes
felt
a
terrible
impulse
to
fly
to
evan
as
if
she
could
wait
only
till
she
had
the
power
to
move
the
feeling
was
wild
impetuous
it
came
like
a
hurricane
wind
sweeping
everything
before
it
and
then
diana
would
feel
her
chains
and
writhe
knowing
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
break
them
but
how
ever
was
life
to
be
endured
life
with
this
other
man
and
how
dreadful
it
was
that
he
was
so
good
and
so
good
to
her
yes
it
would
be
easier
if
he
did
not
care
for
her
so
well
far
easier
easier
even
if
he
were
not
himself
so
good
the
power
of
his
goodness
fettered
diana
it
was
a
spell
upon
her
yes
and
she
wanted
to
be
good
too
she
would
not
forfeit
heaven
because
she
had
lost
earth
no
and
not
to
gain
earth
back
again
but
how
was
she
to
live
and
what
if
she
should
be
unable
always
to
hide
her
feeling
and
basil
should
come
to
know
it
how
would
live
what
if
she
had
said
strange
things
in
her
days
and
nights
of
illness
they
were
all
like
a
confused
misty
landscape
to
her
nothing
taking
shape
she
could
not
tell
how
it
might
have
been
restless
and
weary
she
was
going
over
all
these
and
a
thousand
other
things
one
day
as
she
did
every
day
when
basil
came
in
he
brought
a
tray
in
his
hand
he
set
it
down
and
came
to
the
bedside
is
it
already
she
asked
are
you
hungry
i
ought
not
to
be
hungry
i
do
think
i
am
why
ought
you
not
to
be
hungry
i
am
doing
nothing
lying
here
i
find
that
is
what
the
people
say
who
are
doing
too
much
extremes
meet
as
usual
he
lifted
diana
up
and
piled
pillows
and
cushions
at
her
back
till
she
was
well
supported
nobody
could
do
this
so
well
as
basil
then
he
brought
the
tray
and
arranged
it
before
her
there
was
a
bit
of
cold
partridge
and
toast
and
basil
filled
diana
cup
from
a
little
teapot
he
had
set
by
the
fire
the
last
degree
of
nicety
was
observable
in
all
these
preparations
diana
ate
her
supper
she
must
live
and
she
must
eat
and
she
could
not
help
being
hungry
though
she
wondered
at
herself
that
she
could
be
so
unnatural
where
could
you
get
this
bird
she
asked
at
length
to
break
the
silence
which
grew
painful
i
caught
it
caught
it
shot
it
do
you
mean
no
i
had
not
time
to
go
after
it
with
a
gun
but
i
set
snares
i
never
knew
partridges
were
so
good
said
diana
though
something
in
her
tone
said
unconsciously
to
her
that
she
cared
not
what
was
good
or
bad
you
did
not
use
your
advantages
that
often
happens
i
had
not
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
get
partridges
said
diana
languidly
the
woods
are
full
of
them
do
you
think
it
is
a
pity
to
catch
them
for
you
said
basil
he
was
removing
her
empty
plate
and
putting
before
her
another
with
an
orange
upon
it
so
accurately
prepared
that
it
stirred
her
admiration
oranges
cried
diana
how
did
you
learn
to
do
everything
basil
do
be
too
curious
said
he
as
he
spoke
he
softly
put
back
off
her
ear
a
stray
lock
of
the
beautiful
brown
hair
which
fell
behind
her
like
a
cloud
of
wavy
brightness
even
from
that
touch
she
inwardly
shrank
outwardly
she
was
impassive
enough
basil
said
diana
suddenly
did
i
talk
foolishly
sometimes
when
i
was
sick
i
mean
do
you
ever
do
it
when
you
are
well
do
i
what
do
you
think
said
he
laughing
albeit
his
heart
was
not
merry
at
the
moment
but
diana
question
was
naive
i
did
not
think
i
was
in
the
habit
of
talking
foolishly
your
thoughts
are
true
and
just
as
usual
it
is
so
far
from
being
in
your
habit
that
it
is
hardly
in
your
power
he
said
tenderly
diana
ate
her
orange
for
she
was
very
fond
of
the
fruit
and
it
gave
occupation
to
hands
and
eyes
while
basil
was
standing
by
she
did
not
like
his
evasion
of
her
question
and
pondered
how
she
could
bring
it
up
again
between
wish
and
fear
before
she
was
ready
to
speak
the
chance
was
gone
as
basil
took
away
her
plate
he
remarked
that
he
had
to
go
down
to
see
old
barstow
and
arranging
her
pillows
anew
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
left
alone
diana
sat
still
propped
up
in
bed
and
stared
into
the
fire
which
grew
brighter
as
the
light
without
waned
how
she
rebelled
against
that
kiss
no
he
has
no
right
to
me
she
cried
in
her
passionate
thoughts
he
has
no
right
to
me
i
am
evan
every
bit
of
me
is
evan
and
nobody
else
o
how
came
i
to
marry
this
man
and
what
shall
i
do
i
wonder
if
i
shall
go
mad
for
i
am
not
going
to
die
but
how
is
it
possible
that
i
can
live
she
was
slow
in
regaining
strength
yet
little
by
little
it
came
back
like
a
monarch
entering
a
country
that
has
rebelled
against
him
by
and
by
she
was
able
to
sit
up
her
husband
had
a
luxurious
sent
from
boston
for
her
and
placed
in
her
room
and
one
evening
it
was
in
february
now
diana
got
up
and
put
herself
in
it
she
had
never
known
such
a
luxurious
piece
of
furniture
in
her
life
she
was
dressed
in
a
warm
wrapper
also
provided
by
her
husband
and
which
seemed
to
her
of
extravagant
daintiness
and
she
sank
into
the
depths
of
the
one
and
the
folds
of
the
other
with
a
helpless
feeling
of
basil
power
over
her
symbolized
and
emphasized
by
these
things
presently
came
basil
himself
again
bringing
her
supper
he
placed
a
small
table
by
her
side
and
set
the
tray
there
put
the
teapot
down
by
the
fire
and
taking
a
view
of
his
wife
gave
a
slight
smile
at
the
picture
he
might
well
having
so
good
a
conscience
as
this
man
had
diana
was
one
of
those
magnificent
women
who
look
well
always
and
anywhere
with
a
kitchen
apron
on
and
hands
in
flour
or
in
the
dishabille
of
careless
undress
but
as
her
husband
saw
her
then
she
was
lovely
in
an
exquisite
degree
she
was
wrapped
in
a
quilted
of
soft
grey
stuff
with
a
warm
shawl
about
her
shoulders
her
beautiful
abundant
hair
which
she
had
been
too
weak
of
hand
and
of
heart
too
to
dress
elaborately
lay
piled
about
her
head
in
loose
bright
wavy
masses
much
more
picturesque
than
diana
would
have
known
how
to
make
them
by
design
i
think
there
is
apt
too
to
be
about
such
women
a
natural
grace
of
motion
or
of
repose
it
was
her
case
to
think
of
herself
or
the
appearance
she
might
at
any
time
be
making
was
foreign
to
diana
the
noble
grace
of
unconsciousness
united
to
her
perfectness
of
build
made
her
always
faultless
in
action
or
attitude
if
she
moved
or
if
she
sat
it
might
have
been
a
duchess
for
the
beautiful
unconscious
ease
with
which
she
did
it
nature
high
breeding
there
is
such
a
thing
and
there
is
such
an
effect
of
it
when
the
constitution
of
mind
and
body
are
alike
noble
basil
poured
out
her
cup
of
tea
and
divided
her
quail
and
then
sat
down
it
was
hard
for
her
to
bear
you
are
too
good
to
me
said
diana
humbly
i
should
like
to
see
you
prove
that
i
am
not
sure
but
you
are
too
good
to
everybody
why
how
can
one
be
too
good
you
wo
get
paid
for
it
i
think
i
shall
said
basil
in
a
quiet
confident
way
he
had
which
was
provoking
if
you
were
arguing
with
him
but
diana
was
not
arguing
with
him
basil
can
never
pay
you
she
said
with
a
voice
that
faltered
a
little
you
are
sure
of
that
in
your
own
mind
very
sure
i
am
a
man
of
a
hopeful
turn
of
nature
shall
i
divide
that
joint
for
you
my
hands
can
not
manage
a
quail
said
diana
yielding
her
knife
and
fork
to
him
what
can
make
me
so
weak
you
have
had
fever
but
i
have
no
fever
now
and
i
do
not
seem
to
get
my
strength
back
after
the
unnatural
tension
nature
takes
her
revenge
it
is
very
hard
on
you
what
diana
did
not
answer
she
had
spoken
that
last
word
with
almost
a
break
in
her
voice
she
gave
her
attention
now
diligently
to
picking
the
quail
bones
but
when
her
supper
was
done
and
the
tray
delivered
over
to
miss
collins
basil
did
not
as
sometimes
he
did
go
away
and
leave
her
but
sat
down
again
and
trimmed
the
fire
diana
lay
back
in
her
chair
looking
at
him
basil
she
said
at
last
after
a
long
silence
do
you
think
mistakes
i
mean
can
ever
be
mended
in
this
world
you
must
define
what
you
mean
by
mistakes
he
said
without
looking
at
her
there
are
no
love
but
those
which
we
make
by
our
own
fault
o
but
yes
there
are
basil
not
what
mean
by
mistakes
then
what
do
you
call
them
when
people
lives
are
all
spoiled
by
something
they
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
by
death
or
sickness
or
accident
or
misfortune
i
call
it
said
basil
slowly
and
still
without
looking
at
her
i
call
it
when
it
touches
me
or
you
or
other
of
the
children
god
good
hand
o
no
basil
people
wickedness
can
not
be
his
hand
people
wickedness
is
their
own
and
other
evil
i
believe
is
wrought
by
the
prince
of
this
world
but
god
will
use
people
wickedness
and
even
satan
mischief
to
his
children
best
good
and
so
it
becomes
in
so
far
his
blessed
hand
do
you
know
he
has
promised
shall
no
evil
happen
to
the
just
and
that
things
shall
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
his
promise
does
not
fail
my
child
but
basil
loads
of
things
do
happen
to
them
which
work
for
their
good
then
what
becomes
of
the
lord
promise
he
can
not
have
made
it
i
think
he
has
made
it
and
you
and
i
believe
it
but
basil
it
is
impossible
i
do
not
see
how
some
things
can
ever
turn
to
people
good
if
any
of
the
lord
children
were
in
doubt
upon
that
point
i
should
recommend
him
to
ask
the
lord
to
enlighten
him
for
the
heavens
may
fall
diana
but
word
of
our
god
shall
stand
for
ever
diana
felt
her
lips
quivering
and
drew
back
into
the
shadow
to
hide
them
but
there
can
be
no
kindness
in
some
of
these
things
that
i
am
thinking
about
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
control
her
voice
and
it
sounded
harsh
even
then
there
is
nothing
but
kindness
when
i
would
not
give
you
strong
coffee
a
while
ago
in
your
fever
do
you
think
i
was
influenced
by
cruel
motives
i
could
never
believe
anything
but
good
of
you
basil
thank
you
do
you
mean
that
of
christ
you
no
said
diana
hesitating
but
i
thought
perhaps
he
might
not
care
he
had
need
to
be
said
basil
for
we
do
try
his
patience
the
best
of
us
has
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
diana
down
into
humiliation
and
death
that
he
might
so
earn
the
right
to
lift
them
off
our
shoulders
and
hearts
and
one
of
his
children
doubts
if
he
cares
but
he
does
not
lift
them
off
basil
said
diana
and
her
voice
trembled
with
the
unshed
tears
he
will
said
her
husband
when
as
soon
as
we
let
him
what
must
i
do
to
let
him
trust
him
wholly
and
follow
him
like
a
child
the
tears
came
diana
could
not
hinder
them
she
laid
her
face
against
the
side
of
her
chair
where
basil
could
not
see
it
chapter
xxviii
evan
sister
slowly
from
this
time
diana
regained
strength
and
by
degrees
took
again
her
former
place
in
the
household
to
miss
collins
vision
she
was
the
same
as
ever
basil
felt
she
was
not
yet
diana
did
every
duty
of
her
station
with
all
the
care
and
diligence
she
had
ever
given
to
it
she
neglected
nothing
basil
wardrobe
was
kept
in
perfect
order
his
linen
was
exquisitely
got
up
his
meals
were
looked
after
and
served
with
all
the
nice
attention
that
was
possible
diana
did
not
in
the
least
lose
her
head
or
sit
brooding
when
there
was
something
to
do
she
did
not
sit
brooding
at
any
time
unless
at
rare
intervals
yet
her
husband
heart
was
very
heavy
with
the
weight
which
rested
on
hers
and
truly
with
his
own
share
as
well
there
was
a
line
in
the
corners
of
diana
sweet
mouth
which
told
him
nobody
else
that
she
was
turning
to
stone
and
the
light
of
her
eye
was
as
it
were
turned
inward
upon
itself
without
stopping
to
brood
over
things
which
she
did
not
her
mind
was
constantly
abiding
in
a
different
sphere
away
from
him
dwelling
afar
off
or
apart
in
a
region
by
itself
he
had
her
physical
presence
but
not
her
spiritual
and
who
cares
for
a
body
without
a
soul
all
this
time
there
was
no
confidence
between
them
basil
knew
indeed
the
whole
facts
of
the
case
but
diana
did
not
know
he
knew
he
wished
she
would
speak
but
believed
now
she
never
would
and
he
could
not
ask
her
truly
he
had
his
own
part
to
bear
and
withal
his
sorrow
and
yearning
tenderness
for
her
sometimes
his
heart
was
nigh
to
break
but
diana
heart
was
broken
was
it
comfort
or
was
it
not
comfort
when
near
the
end
of
spring
a
little
daughter
was
born
to
them
diana
in
any
circumstances
was
too
true
a
woman
not
to
enter
upon
a
mother
riches
and
responsibilities
with
a
full
heart
not
to
enter
thoroughly
into
a
mother
joy
and
dignity
it
was
a
beautiful
something
that
had
come
into
her
life
so
far
as
itself
was
concerned
and
no
young
mother
hands
ever
touched
more
tenderly
the
little
pink
bundle
committed
to
them
nor
ever
any
mother
eyes
hung
more
intently
over
her
wonderful
new
possession
but
lift
the
burden
from
diana
heart
her
baby
did
not
there
was
something
awful
about
it
too
for
it
was
another
bond
that
bound
her
to
a
man
she
did
not
love
when
diana
was
strong
enough
she
sometimes
shed
floods
of
tears
over
the
little
unconscious
face
the
only
human
confident
she
dared
trust
with
her
secret
before
this
time
her
tears
had
been
few
something
in
the
baby
took
the
hardness
from
her
or
else
gave
one
of
those
inexplicable
touches
to
the
spring
of
tears
which
we
can
neither
resist
nor
account
for
but
the
baby
father
was
as
fond
of
her
as
her
mother
and
had
a
right
to
be
diana
knew
and
that
tried
her
she
grudged
basil
the
right
on
the
whole
i
think
however
the
baby
did
diana
good
as
for
basil
it
did
him
good
he
thanked
god
and
took
courage
the
summer
had
begun
when
diana
was
able
to
come
again
one
afternoon
she
was
there
in
her
little
parlour
come
down
for
a
change
the
windows
were
open
and
she
sat
thinking
of
many
things
her
had
been
moved
down
to
this
room
and
diana
in
white
as
basil
liked
to
see
her
was
lying
back
in
it
close
beside
the
window
june
was
on
the
hills
and
in
the
air
and
in
the
garden
for
a
bunch
of
red
roses
stood
in
a
glass
on
the
table
and
one
was
fastened
at
diana
belt
and
another
stuck
in
her
beautiful
hair
not
by
her
own
hands
truly
basil
had
brought
in
the
roses
a
little
while
ago
and
held
them
to
her
nose
and
then
put
one
in
her
hair
and
one
in
her
belt
diana
suffered
it
all
careless
and
unknowing
of
the
exquisite
effect
which
her
husband
smiled
at
and
then
went
off
for
his
work
called
him
she
had
heard
his
horse
going
away
at
a
gallop
and
the
sound
carried
her
thoughts
back
away
as
a
little
thing
will
to
a
time
when
masters
used
to
come
to
her
old
home
to
visit
her
mother
and
her
and
then
ride
off
so
yes
and
in
those
clays
another
came
too
and
june
days
were
sweet
then
as
now
and
roses
bloomed
and
the
robins
were
whistling
then
also
she
remembered
did
fates
and
life
courses
never
change
was
it
all
june
to
them
every
year
how
the
robins
whistled
their
answer
all
june
to
them
every
year
and
the
smell
of
roses
did
not
change
nor
the
colour
of
the
light
and
the
fresh
green
of
the
young
foliage
was
deep
and
bright
and
glittering
as
ever
it
was
just
the
same
and
a
human
life
could
have
all
sweet
scents
and
bright
tints
and
glad
sounds
fall
out
of
it
and
not
to
come
back
there
is
nothing
but
duty
left
thought
diana
and
duty
with
all
the
sap
gone
out
of
it
duty
was
left
a
dry
tree
and
more
a
tree
so
full
of
thorns
that
she
could
not
touch
it
without
being
stung
and
pierced
yet
even
so
to
this
stake
of
duty
she
was
bound
diana
sat
cheerlessly
gazing
out
into
the
june
sunlight
which
laughed
at
her
with
no
power
to
gain
a
smile
in
return
when
a
step
came
along
the
narrow
entry
and
the
doorway
was
filled
with
presence
mother
and
daughter
looked
at
each
other
in
a
peculiar
way
they
had
now
diana
face
cold
starling
face
hard
well
said
the
latter
how
are
you
getting
along
you
see
i
am
i
see
you
doing
nothing
masters
wont
let
me
humph
when
had
a
baby
four
weeks
old
i
had
my
own
way
and
so
would
you
if
you
wanted
to
have
it
my
husband
will
not
let
me
have
it
that
fool
nonsense
diana
if
you
are
the
girl
i
take
you
for
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
with
your
husband
no
man
that
ever
lived
would
make
sit
with
my
hands
before
me
who
got
the
baby
jemima
how
jemima
to
do
her
work
and
your
work
too
she
ca
do
it
no
but
masters
is
going
to
get
another
person
to
help
take
care
of
baby
a
nurse
cried
starling
aghast
no
not
exactly
but
somebody
to
help
me
are
you
turned
weak
and
sickly
diana
no
mother
then
you
do
want
another
girl
any
more
than
a
frog
wants
an
umbrella
put
your
baby
in
the
crib
and
teach
her
to
lie
there
when
you
are
busy
that
the
way
you
were
brought
up
you
must
talk
to
masters
mother
i
do
want
to
talk
to
masters
i
got
something
else
to
do
but
you
can
talk
to
him
diana
and
he
do
what
you
say
it
the
other
way
mother
i
must
do
what
he
says
diana
tone
was
peculiar
then
you
turned
soft
i
think
i
am
turned
hard
your
husband
is
easy
to
manage
for
you
is
he
said
diana
i
am
glad
it
is
true
i
despise
men
that
are
easy
to
manage
i
am
glad
i
can
respect
him
at
any
rate
starling
looked
at
her
daughter
with
an
odd
expression
it
was
curious
and
uncertain
but
she
asked
no
question
she
seemed
to
change
the
subject
though
perhaps
the
connection
was
close
did
you
hear
the
family
are
coming
to
elmfield
again
this
summer
diana
lips
formed
the
word
no
the
breath
of
it
hardly
got
out
yes
they
coming
sure
enough
phemie
will
be
here
next
week
and
her
sister
what
her
name
mrs
reverdy
is
here
now
silence
i
suppose
they
fill
the
house
with
company
as
they
did
last
time
and
cut
up
their
shines
as
usual
well
they
do
come
in
my
way
but
you
have
to
see
i
guess
why
you
know
they
make
a
great
to
do
about
your
husband
in
that
family
and
genevieve
reverdy
seems
uncommonly
fond
of
you
she
asked
me
no
end
of
questions
about
you
on
sabbath
there
flushed
a
hot
colour
into
diana
cheeks
which
faded
away
and
left
them
very
pale
she
has
grown
old
a
bit
starling
went
on
talking
rather
uneasily
nor
she
hai
grown
wise
neither
she
ca
ask
you
how
you
do
without
a
giggle
and
she
had
dressed
herself
to
come
to
church
as
if
the
church
was
a
fair
and
she
was
something
for
sale
flowers
and
feathers
and
laces
and
ribbons
a
little
there
and
a
little
here
bows
on
her
gloves
and
bows
on
her
shoes
and
bows
on
her
gown
i
believed
she
would
have
tucked
some
into
the
corners
of
her
mouth
if
they
would
have
stayed
diana
made
no
reply
she
was
looking
out
into
the
sunlit
hillside
in
view
from
her
window
and
had
grown
visibly
whiter
since
her
mother
came
in
starling
reviewed
her
for
that
instant
with
a
keen
anxious
searching
gaze
which
changed
before
diana
turned
her
head
i
ca
make
out
for
my
part
what
such
folks
are
in
the
world
for
she
went
on
they
do
do
no
good
to
themselves
nor
to
nobody
else
and
fools
mostly
contrive
to
do
harm
well
she
coming
to
see
you
she
be
along
one
of
these
days
to
see
me
diana
echoed
so
she
says
maybe
it
all
flummery
i
daresay
it
is
but
she
talked
a
lot
of
it
you
ha
thought
there
war
any
one
else
in
the
world
she
cared
about
seeing
starling
went
at
this
point
to
see
the
baby
and
diana
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
with
her
thoughts
in
a
wild
confusion
of
pain
pain
and
fright
i
might
say
and
yet
her
senses
took
the
most
delicate
notice
of
all
there
was
in
the
world
outside
to
attract
them
could
it
be
june
once
so
fair
and
laughing
that
smote
her
now
with
such
blows
of
memory
hammer
or
was
it
memory
using
june
she
saw
the
bright
glisten
of
the
leaves
upon
the
hillside
the
rich
growth
of
the
grass
the
fair
beams
of
the
summer
sun
she
noticed
minutely
the
stage
of
development
which
the
chestnut
blossoms
had
reached
one
or
two
dandelion
heads
a
robin
redbreast
that
was
making
himself
exceedingly
at
home
on
the
little
spread
of
greensward
behind
the
house
i
know
if
diana
senses
were
trying
to
cheat
her
heart
but
from
one
item
to
another
her
eye
went
and
her
mind
followed
in
a
maze
of
pain
that
was
not
cheated
at
all
till
she
heard
her
mother
steps
forsake
the
house
then
diana
head
sank
and
then
even
at
the
moment
as
if
the
robin
whistle
had
brought
them
the
words
came
to
her
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
an
absolute
promise
of
the
lord
to
his
people
could
it
be
true
when
trouble
was
beyond
deliverance
and
then
came
basil
faith
to
her
help
she
knew
how
he
believed
every
word
no
matter
how
difficult
or
impossible
and
diana
fell
on
her
knees
and
hid
her
face
and
fled
to
the
one
only
last
refuge
of
earth
despairing
children
how
even
god
could
deliver
her
diana
did
not
see
for
the
ground
seemed
giving
away
beneath
her
feet
but
it
is
the
man
who
can
not
swim
who
clutches
the
rope
for
life
and
death
and
it
is
when
we
are
hopeless
of
our
own
strength
that
we
throw
ourselves
utterly
upon
the
one
hand
that
is
strong
diana
was
conscious
of
little
else
but
of
doing
that
to
form
a
connected
prayer
was
beyond
her
she
rather
held
up
the
promise
as
it
were
with
both
hands
and
pleaded
it
mutely
and
with
the
intensity
of
one
hovering
between
life
and
death
the
house
was
still
she
feared
no
disturbance
and
she
remained
motionless
without
change
of
posture
either
of
mind
or
body
for
some
length
of
time
gradually
the
i
will
deliver
thee
i
will
deliver
thee
began
to
emphasize
itself
to
her
consciousness
like
a
whisper
in
the
storm
and
diana
burst
into
a
terrible
flood
of
tears
that
touch
of
divine
sympathy
broke
her
heart
she
sobbed
for
minutes
only
keeping
her
sobs
too
noiseless
to
reach
and
alarm
miss
collins
ears
till
her
agony
was
softened
and
changed
at
last
into
something
more
like
a
child
exhausted
and
humble
tears
while
her
breast
rose
and
fell
so
pitifully
with
that
came
also
a
vague
floating
thought
or
two
my
duty
i
do
my
duty
i
do
my
duty
it
was
over
and
she
had
risen
and
was
resting
in
her
chair
feeling
weaker
and
yet
much
stronger
than
before
waiting
till
she
could
dare
show
her
face
to
miss
collins
when
a
little
low
tap
was
heard
at
the
front
door
company
but
diana
had
noticed
no
step
and
heard
no
wheels
however
there
was
no
escape
for
her
if
it
were
company
she
waited
and
the
tap
was
repeated
i
do
know
what
about
it
this
second
time
sent
a
thrill
all
down
diana
nerves
the
doors
were
open
and
seeing
that
miss
collins
did
not
stir
diana
uttered
a
soft
come
she
was
hardly
surprised
at
what
followed
she
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
what
it
would
be
where
shall
i
come
asked
a
voice
and
a
pair
of
brisk
shoes
tripped
into
the
house
and
a
little
trilling
laugh
equally
light
and
meaningless
followed
the
words
where
shall
i
come
it
an
enchanted
castle
i
see
nobody
but
the
next
instant
she
could
not
say
that
for
diana
showed
herself
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
reverdy
hastened
forward
diana
was
calm
now
with
a
possession
of
herself
which
she
marvelled
at
even
then
bringing
her
visitor
into
the
little
parlour
she
placed
herself
again
in
her
chair
with
her
face
turned
from
the
light
and
here
i
find
you
o
you
beautiful
creature
reverdy
burst
out
i
declare
i
do
wonder
at
anything
and
she
laughed
the
laugh
grated
terribly
on
diana
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
a
beauty
you
are
she
went
on
i
declare
i
did
know
you
were
half
so
handsome
have
you
changed
since
three
years
ago
i
think
i
must
diana
said
quietly
but
where
have
you
been
living
here
in
pleasant
valley
was
the
next
not
very
polite
question
people
do
live
in
pleasant
valley
did
you
think
not
diana
answered
o
yes
no
not
what
we
call
life
you
know
and
you
were
always
handsome
but
three
years
ago
you
were
just
diana
starling
and
now
you
might
be
anybody
i
am
masters
wife
said
diana
setting
her
teeth
as
it
were
upon
the
words
yes
i
heard
how
happened
it
do
you
know
i
am
afraid
you
have
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
o
you
handsome
women
you
have
a
great
deal
to
account
for
did
you
never
think
you
had
another
admirer
in
those
days
long
ago
you
know
what
if
i
had
diana
said
almost
fiercely
o
of
course
said
reverdy
with
her
laugh
again
of
course
it
is
nothing
to
you
now
girls
are
towards
their
old
lovers
i
know
that
but
were
you
a
little
tender
towards
him
once
he
has
forgotten
his
part
i
can
tell
you
you
must
be
diana
if
the
woman
could
have
spoken
without
laughing
that
little
meaningless
trill
at
the
end
of
everything
made
diana
nearly
wild
she
could
find
no
answer
to
the
last
speech
and
so
remained
silent
now
i
have
seen
you
again
i
declare
i
do
wonder
at
anything
i
was
inclined
to
quarrel
with
him
you
know
thinking
it
was
just
a
boyish
foolish
fancy
that
he
ought
to
get
over
i
was
a
little
out
of
patience
with
him
but
now
i
see
you
i
take
it
all
back
i
declare
you
a
woman
the
men
might
rave
about
you
must
mind
if
they
do
there
is
another
question
whether
my
husband
will
mind
she
said
the
words
with
a
hard
relentless
force
upon
herself
is
he
jealous
laughing
he
has
no
reason
reason
o
people
are
jealous
without
reason
they
do
wait
for
that
better
without
than
with
how
is
masters
is
he
one
of
that
kind
and
how
came
he
to
marry
you
you
ought
not
to
wonder
at
it
with
the
opinion
you
have
expressed
of
me
o
no
i
do
wonder
at
all
but
somebody
else
wanted
to
marry
you
too
and
somebody
else
thought
he
had
the
best
right
i
am
afraid
you
flirted
with
him
or
was
it
with
masters
you
flirted
i
think
you
were
a
girl
to
flirt
but
i
see
you
would
keep
just
quietly
still
and
they
would
flutter
round
you
like
moths
round
a
candle
and
it
would
be
their
own
fault
if
they
both
got
burned
has
masters
got
burned
my
poor
moth
has
singed
his
wings
badly
i
can
tell
you
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
so
am
i
diana
said
gravely
are
you
are
you
really
are
you
sorry
for
him
may
i
tell
him
you
are
sorry
you
have
not
said
whom
you
are
talking
about
diana
answered
with
a
coldness
which
she
wondered
at
when
she
said
it
o
but
you
know
there
is
only
one
person
i
could
be
talking
about
there
is
only
one
i
could
care
enough
about
to
be
talking
for
him
you
can
not
help
but
know
may
i
tell
him
you
say
you
are
sorry
for
him
it
would
be
a
sort
of
comfort
and
he
wants
it
you
must
ask
mr
masters
what
that
whether
i
may
tell
evan
you
are
sorry
for
him
whether
you
may
tell
that
to
anybody
i
do
want
to
tell
it
to
but
one
said
reverdy
laughing
what
has
masters
to
do
with
it
he
is
my
husband
and
calmly
as
diana
said
it
she
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
shriek
out
the
words
to
the
birds
on
the
hillside
to
the
angels
if
there
were
angels
in
the
air
yet
she
said
it
calmly
but
do
you
ask
your
husband
about
everything
you
do
or
say
if
i
think
he
would
not
like
it
but
that
is
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
power
too
much
husband
are
fallible
as
well
as
wives
said
reverdy
laughing
masters
is
not
fallible
at
least
i
never
saw
him
fail
in
anything
if
he
ever
made
a
mistake
it
was
when
he
married
me
and
you
said
reverdy
did
you
make
a
mistake
too
in
marrying
somebody
so
much
too
good
for
me
yes
diana
answered
the
little
woman
was
a
good
deal
baffled
then
have
you
really
no
kind
word
for
evan
must
i
tell
him
so
diana
felt
as
if
her
brain
would
have
reeled
in
another
minute
before
she
could
answer
came
the
sound
of
a
little
wailing
cry
from
the
room
and
she
started
up
that
movement
was
sudden
but
the
next
were
collected
and
slow
you
will
excuse
me
she
said
i
hear
baby
and
she
passed
from
the
room
like
a
princess
if
her
manner
had
been
less
discouraging
i
think
reverdy
would
have
still
pursued
her
point
and
asked
leave
to
follow
her
and
see
the
baby
but
slow
languid
dignity
and
gracious
composure
imposed
upon
the
little
woman
and
she
gave
up
the
game
at
least
for
the
present
when
miss
collins
set
free
hurried
down
reverdy
was
gone
chapter
xxix
husband
and
wife
had
she
no
kind
word
for
evan
diana
felt
as
if
her
heart
would
snap
some
one
of
its
cords
and
give
over
its
weary
beating
at
once
and
for
ever
no
kind
word
for
evan
her
beloved
her
betrayed
her
once
towards
whom
still
all
the
wealth
of
her
heart
longed
to
pour
itself
out
and
she
might
not
send
him
one
kind
word
and
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
true
to
him
and
yet
he
had
remained
true
to
her
might
he
not
know
so
much
as
that
and
that
her
heart
was
breaking
as
well
as
his
only
it
would
not
break
all
the
pain
of
death
without
its
cessation
of
consciousness
why
not
let
him
have
one
word
to
know
that
she
loved
him
still
and
would
always
love
him
truth
truth
and
duty
loyal
faith
to
her
husband
the
man
whom
in
her
mistake
she
had
married
o
why
could
not
such
mistakes
be
undone
but
they
never
could
never
it
was
a
living
death
that
she
was
condemned
to
die
i
can
not
say
that
diana
really
wavered
at
all
in
her
truth
but
this
was
an
hour
of
storm
never
to
be
remembered
without
shuddering
she
had
her
baby
in
her
arms
but
the
mother
instincts
were
for
the
time
swallowed
up
in
the
stormier
passions
of
the
woman
she
cared
for
it
and
ministered
to
it
tenderly
as
ever
yet
in
a
mechanical
automatic
sort
of
way
taking
no
comfort
and
finding
no
relief
in
her
sweet
duty
it
was
the
roar
of
the
storm
and
the
howling
of
temptation
which
overwhelmed
every
other
voice
in
her
heart
then
there
were
practical
questions
to
be
met
reverdy
and
her
family
at
elmfield
who
could
guarantee
that
evan
would
not
get
a
furlough
and
come
there
too
reverdy
words
seemed
to
have
some
ultimate
design
which
they
had
not
indeed
declared
they
had
the
air
of
somewhat
different
from
mere
aimless
rattle
or
mischievous
gossip
suppose
evan
were
to
come
what
then
the
baby
went
off
to
sleep
and
was
laid
away
in
its
crib
and
the
mother
stood
alone
at
the
window
wrestling
with
her
pain
she
felt
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
it
as
almost
never
before
danger
was
looming
up
and
threatening
dark
in
the
distance
there
might
be
a
whirlwind
coming
out
of
that
storm
quarter
and
how
was
she
going
to
stand
in
the
whirlwind
beyond
the
wordless
cry
which
meant
lord
help
me
diana
could
hardly
pray
at
all
at
this
moment
and
the
feeling
grew
that
she
must
have
human
help
tell
basil
a
whisper
said
in
her
heart
she
had
shunned
that
thought
always
she
had
judged
it
no
use
now
she
was
driven
to
it
he
must
know
the
whole
perhaps
then
he
could
tell
her
what
to
do
as
soon
as
diana
mind
through
all
its
tossings
and
turnings
had
fixed
upon
this
point
she
went
immediately
from
thought
to
action
it
was
twilight
now
or
almost
basil
would
not
come
home
in
time
for
a
talk
before
supper
supper
must
be
ready
so
as
to
have
no
needless
delay
she
could
wait
now
she
knew
what
she
would
do
though
there
was
a
fire
burning
at
heart
and
brain
she
went
and
ordered
something
to
be
got
ready
for
supper
finished
the
arrangement
of
the
which
her
husband
liked
to
have
very
dainty
picked
a
rose
for
his
plate
though
it
seemed
dreadful
mockery
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
his
step
at
the
door
she
made
the
tea
what
an
atmosphere
of
sweet
calm
brightness
he
brought
in
with
him
and
always
brought
it
struck
diana
now
with
the
kind
of
a
shiver
which
a
person
in
a
fever
feels
at
the
touch
of
fresh
air
yet
she
recognised
the
beauty
of
it
and
it
fortified
her
in
her
resolve
she
would
be
true
to
this
man
though
she
died
for
it
there
was
nothing
but
truth
in
him
she
got
through
the
as
she
could
swallowed
tea
and
even
ate
bread
without
knowing
how
it
tasted
and
heard
basil
talk
without
knowing
what
he
said
as
soon
as
she
could
she
went
to
the
baby
and
waited
till
her
husband
should
come
too
but
when
he
came
he
came
to
her
and
did
not
go
to
his
study
basil
i
want
to
speak
to
you
will
you
come
into
the
other
room
she
said
huskily
wo
this
room
do
to
talk
in
no
it
is
over
the
kitchen
jemima
knows
i
never
quarrel
said
basil
lightly
however
he
led
the
way
into
the
study
he
set
a
chair
for
diana
and
took
another
himself
but
she
remained
standing
basil
is
god
good
she
said
yes
inexpressibly
good
then
why
does
he
let
such
things
happen
sit
down
di
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
talk
standing
such
things
what
things
why
does
he
let
people
be
tempted
above
what
they
can
bear
he
never
does
his
children
if
that
is
what
you
mean
he
always
provides
a
way
of
escape
where
at
christ
feet
basil
how
can
i
get
there
she
said
with
a
sob
you
there
my
darling
he
said
putting
her
gently
into
the
she
had
disregarded
those
who
trust
in
him
his
hand
never
lets
go
they
may
seem
to
themselves
to
lose
their
standing
they
may
not
feel
the
ground
under
their
feet
but
he
knows
and
he
will
not
let
them
fall
if
they
hold
fast
to
him
diana
basil
you
do
know
the
whole
do
you
want
to
tell
me
her
voice
was
abrupt
and
hoarse
his
was
calm
and
cool
as
the
fall
of
the
dew
i
want
to
tell
you
if
i
can
but
i
shall
hurt
you
i
am
very
willing
if
it
eases
you
go
on
it
wont
ease
me
but
you
must
know
it
you
ought
to
know
o
basil
i
made
such
a
mistake
when
i
married
you
she
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
so
bitter
as
that
she
was
where
she
could
not
measure
her
words
perhaps
his
face
paled
a
little
in
the
faint
light
she
could
not
see
the
change
of
colour
his
voice
did
not
change
what
new
has
brought
that
up
nothing
new
something
old
o
basil
his
sister
has
been
here
to
see
me
has
she
his
voice
did
change
a
little
then
what
did
she
come
for
i
do
know
and
will
be
here
perhaps
by
and
by
o
basil
do
you
know
who
it
is
and
what
shall
i
do
diana
had
sprung
up
from
her
chair
and
dropped
down
on
the
floor
by
her
husband
side
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
on
his
knee
his
hand
passed
tenderly
sorrowfully
over
the
beautiful
hair
which
lay
in
disordered
bright
soft
masses
over
head
and
neck
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
basil
do
you
know
who
it
is
i
know
what
shall
i
do
what
do
you
want
to
do
diana
right
she
said
gasping
without
looking
up
i
am
sure
of
it
he
said
tenderly
well
then
the
only
way
is
to
go
on
and
do
right
diana
but
how
can
i
how
shall
i
suppose
he
comes
o
basil
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
wrote
and
mother
kept
back
the
letters
and
i
never
got
them
he
sent
them
and
i
never
got
them
and
i
thought
he
was
not
true
and
it
did
not
matter
what
i
did
and
i
honoured
you
above
everything
basil
and
so
and
so
i
did
what
i
did
what
can
not
be
undone
no
she
said
shivering
he
passed
his
hands
again
over
her
soft
hair
and
bent
down
and
kissed
it
you
honour
yourself
too
diana
as
well
as
me
yes
she
said
under
breath
and
you
honour
our
god
who
has
let
all
this
come
upon
us
both
but
o
basil
how
could
he
how
could
he
i
do
know
and
yet
you
say
he
is
good
and
so
you
say
too
the
only
good
the
utterly
perfectly
good
who
loves
his
people
and
keeps
his
promises
and
who
has
said
that
all
things
shall
work
together
for
the
good
of
those
that
love
him
how
can
such
a
thing
as
this
she
said
faintly
suppose
you
and
i
can
not
see
how
then
faith
comes
in
and
believes
it
without
seeing
we
shall
see
by
and
by
but
basil
suppose
evan
comes
well
suppose
he
came
here
well
diana
she
was
silent
then
but
she
shook
and
trembled
and
writhed
her
head
was
still
where
she
had
laid
it
her
face
hidden
you
are
going
through
as
great
a
trial
my
poor
wife
as
almost
ever
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
mortal
but
you
will
go
through
it
and
come
out
from
it
and
then
it
will
be
found
to
have
been
praise
and
honour
and
glory
by
and
by
o
how
can
you
tell
i
trust
in
god
and
i
trust
you
but
i
think
he
will
come
here
to
pleasant
valley
i
mean
and
if
he
comes
here
to
this
house
i
mean
what
then
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
seeing
him
yes
what
you
like
best
to
do
diana
basil
he
does
not
know
what
does
he
not
know
about
the
letters
or
anything
he
has
never
heard
never
a
word
from
me
there
was
an
understanding
between
you
before
he
went
away
oh
yes
both
were
silent
again
for
a
time
silent
and
still
then
diana
spoke
timidly
do
you
think
it
would
be
wrong
for
him
to
know
her
husband
delayed
his
answer
a
little
truly
if
diana
had
something
to
suffer
so
had
he
and
i
suppose
there
was
somewhat
of
a
struggle
in
his
own
mind
to
be
won
through
however
the
answer
when
it
came
was
a
quiet
negative
may
i
write
and
tell
him
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
fingers
as
he
replied
i
will
o
basil
said
the
woman
at
his
feet
i
have
wished
i
could
die
a
thousand
times
and
i
am
well
and
strong
and
i
can
not
die
no
he
said
gravely
we
must
not
run
away
from
our
work
work
said
diana
sitting
back
now
and
looking
up
at
him
what
work
the
work
our
master
has
given
us
to
do
to
glorify
him
to
fight
with
evil
and
overcome
it
to
endure
temptation
and
baffle
it
to
carry
our
banner
of
salvation
through
the
thick
of
the
smoke
and
the
fire
and
never
let
it
fall
i
am
so
weak
i
can
not
fight
the
fight
of
faith
you
can
the
only
sort
of
fighting
that
can
prevail
faith
lays
hold
of
christ
strength
and
so
comes
off
more
than
conqueror
all
you
can
do
is
to
hold
fast
to
him
o
basil
why
does
he
let
such
things
happen
why
does
he
let
such
things
happen
here
is
my
life
broken
and
yours
both
broken
and
ruined
no
the
minister
answered
quietly
not
mine
nor
yours
broken
if
you
will
but
not
ruined
neither
yours
nor
mine
diana
with
the
love
of
christ
in
our
hearts
that
can
never
be
he
will
not
let
it
be
it
is
all
ruined
said
diana
it
is
all
ruined
i
am
full
of
evil
thoughts
and
no
good
left
i
have
wished
to
die
and
i
have
wanted
to
run
away
i
felt
as
if
i
must
but
instead
of
dying
or
running
away
you
have
stood
nobly
and
bravely
to
your
post
of
suffering
wait
and
trust
the
lord
means
good
to
us
yet
what
possible
good
perhaps
that
being
stripped
of
all
else
we
may
come
to
know
him
is
it
necessary
that
people
should
be
stripped
of
all
before
they
can
do
that
sometimes
diana
stood
still
and
again
there
was
silence
in
the
room
the
soft
june
air
heavy
with
the
breath
of
roses
floated
in
at
the
open
window
bringing
one
of
those
sharp
contrasts
which
make
the
heart
sick
with
memory
and
longing
albeit
the
balsam
of
promise
be
there
too
people
miss
that
now
men
see
not
the
bright
light
that
is
in
the
clouds
and
how
should
they
when
the
darkness
of
night
seems
to
have
fallen
how
can
they
even
remember
that
behind
that
screen
of
darkness
there
is
a
flood
of
glory
there
came
in
sounds
at
the
window
too
from
the
garden
and
the
wood
on
the
hillside
chirruping
sounds
of
insects
mingled
with
the
slight
rustle
of
leaves
and
the
trickle
of
water
from
a
little
brook
which
made
all
the
noise
it
could
over
the
stones
in
its
way
down
the
hill
the
voices
were
of
tender
peace
the
roses
and
the
small
life
of
nature
all
really
told
of
love
and
care
which
can
as
little
fail
for
the
lord
children
as
for
the
furniture
of
their
yet
that
very
unchangeableness
of
nature
hurts
which
should
comfort
diana
stood
still
desolate
to
her
own
sense
seeming
a
ruin
already
and
her
husband
sat
in
his
place
also
still
but
he
was
calm
they
were
quiet
long
enough
to
think
of
many
things
you
are
very
good
basil
diana
said
at
last
it
was
one
of
those
words
which
hurt
unreasonably
not
because
they
are
not
true
words
and
heartily
meant
but
because
they
are
the
poor
substitute
for
those
we
would
like
to
hear
and
give
us
an
ugly
scale
to
measure
distances
and
differences
by
basil
made
no
sort
of
answer
diana
stood
still
in
her
confusion
of
thoughts
she
did
not
miss
the
answer
then
she
began
again
evan
i
mean
basil
and
she
started
i
wish
we
could
get
away
from
pleasant
valley
yes
my
work
is
here
is
mine
here
too
thought
diana
as
she
slowly
went
away
into
the
other
room
what
is
mine
to
die
by
this
fire
that
burns
in
me
or
to
freeze
stiff
in
the
cold
that
sometimes
almost
stops
my
heart
beating
she
came
up
to
the
side
of
her
baby
crib
and
stood
there
looking
dimly
conscious
of
an
inner
voice
that
said
her
work
was
not
death

sunshine
a
few
days
later
the
minister
came
home
one
evening
with
a
message
for
his
wife
good
old
mother
bartlett
is
going
home
diana
and
she
wants
to
see
you
home
is
she
dying
do
you
mean
does
not
mean
it
to
her
it
is
entering
into
life
but
what
the
matter
you
know
she
had
that
bad
cold
i
think
the
treatment
was
worse
than
the
disease
and
under
the
effects
of
both
her
strength
seems
to
have
given
way
she
is
sinking
quietly
i
will
go
down
there
in
the
morning
so
the
next
day
early
basil
drove
his
wife
down
and
left
her
at
the
cottage
it
was
somehow
to
diana
feeling
just
such
another
day
as
had
been
that
other
wonderful
one
when
she
had
seen
evan
first
and
he
harnessed
prince
and
they
came
together
over
this
very
road
perhaps
soon
evan
would
be
riding
there
again
without
her
as
she
was
going
now
without
him
never
together
again
never
together
again
and
what
was
life
to
either
of
them
apart
diana
went
into
the
cottage
walking
as
one
in
a
dream
the
cottage
was
in
nice
order
as
usual
though
no
woman
hand
had
been
about
joe
rough
as
he
was
could
be
what
his
friends
called
real
handy
and
he
had
put
everything
in
trim
and
taken
all
care
for
his
mother
comfort
before
he
went
out
the
minister
had
told
him
diana
would
be
there
so
after
he
had
done
this
he
went
to
his
work
bartlett
was
lying
on
her
bed
in
the
inner
room
diana
kissed
her
with
a
heart
too
full
at
the
moment
to
speak
did
the
minister
bring
you
the
old
lady
asked
yes
are
you
all
alone
the
lord
never
leaves
his
children
alone
dear
they
leave
him
sometimes
wo
you
open
the
winders
diana
joe
forgot
that
and
i
want
to
see
the
sun
diana
rolled
up
the
thick
paper
shades
which
hung
over
the
windows
and
put
up
the
sashes
summer
air
poured
in
so
full
of
warmth
and
brightness
and
sounds
of
nature
activity
that
it
seemed
to
roll
up
a
tide
of
life
to
the
very
feet
of
the
dying
woman
she
looked
and
drew
a
deep
breath
or
two
that
good
she
said
the
lord
made
the
sunshine
now
sit
down
dear
i
want
to
see
you
sit
down
there
where
i
see
you
does
joe
leave
you
here
by
yourself
he
knew
you
was
comin
joe
a
good
boy
but
i
do
want
him
nor
nobody
hangin
round
all
the
time
diana
there
ai
nothin
to
do
only
he
forgot
the
winders
and
i
want
to
look
out
and
see
all
my
riches
your
riches
mother
bartlett
and
she
was
not
going
to
live
but
a
few
days
more
diana
wondered
if
her
senses
were
wandering
but
the
old
lady
smiled
the
wise
sweet
smile
that
diana
knew
of
old
whose
be
they
then
she
asked
you
mean
all
this
pretty
summer
day
ai
it
pretty
and
ai
the
sunshine
clear
gold
and
ai
the
sky
a
kind
of
an
elegant
canopy
and
it
all
mine
and
all
it
covers
and
he
that
made
it
too
and
seein
what
he
makes
puts
me
in
mind
of
how
rich
he
is
and
what
more
he
kin
do
how
the
baby
for
some
little
time
the
baby
was
talked
of
in
both
present
and
future
relations
and
you
very
happy
diana
the
old
woman
asked
i
hai
seen
you
now
for
quite
a
spell
all
winter
i
ought
to
be
diana
answered
hesitating
some
things
folks
does
because
they
had
ought
to
remarked
the
old
lady
but
bein
happy
ai
one
of
the
whole
world
had
ought
to
be
happy
if
you
put
it
so
the
lord
wants
to
be
not
happy
said
diana
hastily
yes
his
fault
if
they
ai
how
can
he
want
everybody
to
be
happy
when
he
makes
them
so
unhappy
he
the
lord
he
do
make
nobody
unhappy
child
how
did
that
git
in
your
head
well
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
mother
bartlett
he
lets
things
happen
he
hai
chained
up
satan
yet
if
that
what
you
mean
but
satan
ca
do
no
harm
to
the
lord
children
he
tried
often
enough
but
the
lord
wo
let
him
but
mother
bartlett
that
only
a
way
of
talking
i
do
know
if
it
is
satan
does
it
but
every
sort
of
terrible
thing
comes
to
them
how
can
you
say
it
not
evil
the
good
lord
turns
it
to
blessing
dear
or
if
he
do
they
wo
let
him
o
course
it
is
satan
does
it
satan
and
his
ministers
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
with
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
how
should
he
be
kind
and
unkind
diana
could
not
trust
her
voice
and
was
silent
the
old
woman
looked
at
her
and
said
in
a
changed
tone
presently
what
come
to
you
diana
masters
you
had
ought
to
be
the
happiest
woman
there
is
livin
diana
could
not
answer
you
dear
bartlett
added
tenderly
i
did
mean
to
speak
of
myself
diana
said
making
a
tremendous
effort
to
bring
out
her
words
unconcernedly
but
i
get
utterly
puzzled
sometimes
mother
bartlett
when
i
see
such
things
happen
such
things
as
do
happen
and
to
good
people
too
you
ai
the
fust
one
that
been
puzzled
that
way
returned
the
old
woman
job
was
all
out
in
his
reckoning
once
and
david
was
as
stupid
as
a
beast
he
says
but
when
chillen
gets
into
the
dark
they
apt
to
run
agin
and
hurt
theirselves
stay
in
the
light
dear
how
can
one
always
o
child
jes
believe
the
lord
word
that
keep
you
near
him
and
there
is
no
darkness
where
he
is
what
his
word
that
i
must
believe
about
this
i
mean
that
he
loves
us
dear
loves
us
tender
and
true
like
you
love
your
little
baby
only
a
deal
more
and
truer
and
tenderer
for
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
but
he
never
will
forget
and
all
things
he
will
make
to
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
him
diana
shook
and
trembled
with
the
effort
to
command
herself
and
not
burst
into
a
storm
of
weeping
which
would
have
betrayed
what
she
did
not
choose
to
betray
she
sat
by
the
bedpost
clasping
it
and
with
the
same
clasp
as
it
were
holding
herself
for
a
moment
had
forgotten
her
sucking
child
the
words
came
home
and
it
was
only
by
that
convulsive
hold
of
herself
that
she
could
keep
from
crying
out
with
her
face
turned
away
from
the
sick
woman
she
waited
till
the
convulsion
had
passed
and
then
said
in
measured
deliberate
accents
it
is
hard
to
see
how
some
things
can
turn
out
for
good
some
things
i
have
known
well
you
ai
infinite
be
you
said
bartlett
you
ca
see
into
the
futur
and
what
more
you
ca
see
into
the
present
you
do
know
what
goin
on
in
your
own
heart
not
as
knows
it
no
more
you
ai
almighty
to
change
things
if
i
was
you
i
would
jest
trust
him
that
is
and
knows
everything
and
almighty
and
kin
do
what
he
likes
then
why
do
he
make
people
good
i
said
he
kin
do
what
he
likes
he
do
like
to
do
people
own
work
for
he
make
good
as
soon
as
they
willin
and
ask
him
but
the
man
sick
with
the
palsy
had
to
rise
and
take
up
his
bed
and
walk
and
what
more
he
had
to
believe
fust
he
could
do
it
i
know
the
lord
gave
the
power
but
the
man
had
his
part
you
see
mother
bartlett
said
diana
rousing
herself
you
must
not
talk
so
much
do
do
me
no
harm
diana
but
you
have
talked
enough
now
let
me
give
you
your
broth
then
you
must
talk
i
hai
so
many
opportunities
o
social
converse
that
i
kin
afford
to
let
one
of
slip
you
must
talk
while
eatin
but
diana
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
she
watched
the
spoonfuls
of
broth
in
attentive
silence
what
new
diana
there
allays
is
nothing
new
only
said
diana
correcting
herself
the
knowltons
are
coming
back
to
elmfield
reverdy
come
be
the
hull
o
them
comin
i
believe
so
what
for
i
do
know
to
enjoy
the
summer
i
suppose
that
their
sort
said
the
old
woman
slowly
jest
to
get
pleasure
i
used
for
to
see
flyin
past
here
in
all
the
colours
o
the
rainbow
last
time
they
was
in
pleasant
valley
but
god
made
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
said
diana
so
he
did
the
old
lady
answered
laughing
a
little
so
he
did
and
the
colours
of
the
flowers
which
is
the
same
colours
to
be
sure
but
what
then
diana
i
was
thinking
mother
bartlett
it
can
not
displease
him
that
we
should
like
them
too
no
child
it
do
nor
it
do
displease
him
to
have
us
wear
nother
if
we
could
only
wear
as
innercently
as
the
flowers
doos
if
you
kin
diana
you
may
be
as
scarlet
as
a
tulip
or
as
bright
as
a
marigold
for
all
i
care
but
people
are
not
any
better
for
putting
on
dark
colours
said
diana
they
some
modester
though
why
they
ai
expectin
that
folks
be
lookin
at
masters
likes
me
to
wear
bright
dresses
then
do
it
child
it
considerable
of
a
pleasure
to
have
his
eyes
pleased
do
you
know
what
a
husband
you
got
diana
yes
he
like
one
o
them
flowers
himself
he
so
full
o
the
sweetness
the
lord
has
put
into
him
and
he
jest
as
unconscious
that
he
spreadin
it
wherever
he
goes
diana
was
silent
she
would
have
liked
again
to
burst
into
tears
she
controlled
herself
as
before
that
ai
the
way
with
those
knowlton
girls
nor
it
ai
the
way
they
wear
their
fine
colours
neither
ca
you
get
a
little
sense
into
their
heads
diana
i
they
think
nothing
of
me
mother
bartlett
maybe
not
two
years
ago
but
they
will
now
you
the
wife
diana
they
allays
sot
a
great
deal
by
him
diana
was
chewing
the
cud
of
this
when
bartlett
asked
again
who
sick
in
the
place
quite
a
number
there
wilson
at
the
tavern
she
sinking
at
last
my
husband
sees
her
every
day
then
old
josh
lightfoot
he
down
with
i
do
know
what
very
sick
saddler
has
a
child
that
has
been
hurt
he
was
pitched
off
a
load
of
hay
and
fell
upon
a
fork
his
mother
is
distracted
about
him
and
it
is
all
masters
can
do
to
quiet
her
and
lizzie
satterthwaite
is
going
slowly
you
know
in
consumption
and
expects
to
see
him
every
day
and
that
all
for
over
in
the
village
of
bromble
there
is
sickness
i
suppose
there
always
is
in
that
miserable
place
and
the
minister
goes
there
too
i
be
bound
o
yes
he
goes
everywhere
if
people
want
him
it
takes
twenty
miles
of
riding
a
day
he
told
me
just
to
visit
all
these
people
that
he
must
see
ay
ay
said
the
old
woman
contentedly
enjoyment
ai
the
end
of
life
but
to
do
the
will
of
god
and
he
doin
it
and
enjoyment
comes
that
way
too
ay
ay
now
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
come
eternal
life
i
hai
ever
been
able
to
do
much
diana
but
it
has
been
sweet
his
service
all
along
the
way
and
now
goin
where
it
be
nothin
but
sweetness
for
ever
a
little
tired
perhaps
with
talking
for
she
had
talked
with
a
good
deal
of
energy
the
old
lady
dozed
off
into
a
nap
and
diana
sat
alone
with
the
summer
stillness
and
thought
over
and
over
some
of
the
words
that
had
been
said
it
was
the
hush
of
the
summer
stillness
and
also
the
full
pulse
of
the
summer
life
that
she
felt
as
she
sat
there
not
soothing
to
inaction
but
stirring
up
the
loving
doing
a
warm
breath
of
vital
energy
an
odorous
of
life
fruitfulness
a
hum
and
a
murmur
of
harmonious
forces
in
action
a
depth
of
colour
in
the
light
and
in
the
shadow
which
told
of
the
richness
and
fullness
of
the
natural
world
nothing
idle
nothing
unfruitful
nothing
out
of
harmony
nothing
in
vain
how
about
diana
masters
and
her
work
and
her
part
in
the
great
plan
again
the
gentle
summer
air
which
stole
in
laden
with
such
scents
and
sweets
rich
and
bountiful
out
of
the
infinite
treasury
spoke
of
love
at
the
heart
of
creation
but
there
were
cold
winds
too
sometimes
icy
storms
desolations
of
tempests
they
had
been
here
not
long
ago
true
but
yet
it
was
not
those
but
which
carried
on
the
life
of
the
world
this
was
the
yes
and
those
others
the
no
of
creation
and
an
affirmative
is
stronger
than
a
negative
any
day
by
universal
acknowledgment
moreover
that
no
was
in
order
to
this
yes
gave
way
before
it
yielded
to
it
and
life
reigned
in
spite
of
death
vaguely
diana
mind
felt
and
carried
on
the
analogy
and
the
reasoning
from
analogy
and
drew
a
chill
hope
from
it
for
it
was
the
time
of
storm
and
desolation
with
her
now
and
the
summer
sun
had
not
come
yet
she
sat
musing
while
the
old
lady
slumbered
hullo
diany
here
you
be
exclaimed
the
voice
of
joe
bartlett
suddenly
breaking
in
here
your
good
man
outside
waitin
for
you
i
guess
his
horse
is
a
leetle
skittish
what
ails
your
mother
my
mother
yes
josh
says
you
see
i
bin
down
to
mill
to
git
some
rye
ground
and
he
was
there
and
what
more
he
had
the
start
of
me
and
i
had
to
wait
for
him
or
i
would
ha
stood
there
chatterin
while
the
sun
was
shinin
like
it
is
that
ai
my
way
but
josh
says
goin
round
groanin
at
and
that
ai
way
nother
mind
you
it
ai
when
anybody
by
i
warrant
you
she
do
give
no
sign
that
anythin
botherin
her
josh
says
it
when
alone
i
did
ask
him
how
he
come
to
know
so
much
and
so
little
but
i
wisht
i
had
joe
finished
his
speech
laughing
diana
took
her
hat
kissed
the
old
woman
and
went
out
to
her
husband
who
was
waiting
for
her
and
some
miles
of
the
drive
were
made
in
silence
then
as
the
old
brown
house
came
in
sight
with
the
weeping
elms
over
the
gate
diana
asked
her
husband
to
stop
for
a
minute
or
two
he
reined
up
under
the
elm
trees
and
helped
diana
out
letting
her
however
go
in
alone
diana
was
not
often
here
naturally
between
her
and
her
mother
who
never
in
the
best
of
times
had
stood
near
together
or
shared
each
other
deeper
sympathies
a
gulf
had
opened
besides
the
place
was
painful
to
diana
on
other
accounts
it
was
full
of
memories
and
associations
she
always
seemed
to
herself
when
there
as
a
dead
person
might
on
revisiting
the
place
where
once
he
had
lived
she
felt
dead
to
all
but
pain
and
the
impression
came
back
with
sharp
torture
that
once
she
used
to
be
alive
so
as
the
shadow
of
the
elm
branches
fell
over
her
now
it
hurt
her
inexpressibly
she
was
alive
when
she
had
dwelt
under
them
yes
she
and
evan
too
she
hurried
her
steps
and
went
in
at
the
door
it
was
now
long
past
the
noon
meal
was
over
apparently
and
every
sign
of
it
cleared
away
the
kitchen
was
in
spotless
order
but
beside
the
table
sat
starling
doing
nothing
an
state
of
affairs
diana
came
farther
in
mother
well
diana
said
starling
looking
up
what
brought
you
now
i
been
down
to
see
bartlett
she
sent
for
me
and
i
thought
i
would
stop
in
as
i
went
by
masters
is
outside
well
i
no
objection
said
starling
ambiguously
how
do
you
do
middling
is
all
getting
on
well
with
the
farm
and
the
dairy
i
do
let
it
be
no
other
way
diana
saw
that
something
was
wrong
but
knew
also
that
if
she
were
to
find
it
out
it
would
be
by
indirect
ways
may
i
go
into
the
pantry
and
get
some
milk
i
been
a
good
while
from
home
and
i
hungry
go
along
said
her
mother
ungraciously
i
should
think
likely
if
are
hungry
your
baby
is
too
that
a
new
way
of
doing
things
ever
my
way
a
woman
that
got
a
baby
ought
to
attend
to
it
an
if
she
do
her
husband
ought
to
make
her
i
not
been
gone
so
long
as
all
that
comes
to
said
diana
and
she
went
into
the
pantry
her
old
domain
the
pans
of
milk
looked
friendly
at
her
the
sweet
clean
smell
of
cream
carried
her
back
it
seemed
ages
to
a
time
when
she
was
as
sweet
and
clean
yet
it
is
not
my
fault
she
said
to
herself
it
is
all
her
she
snatched
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
swallowed
it
hastily
then
as
she
came
out
she
saw
that
one
of
her
mother
hands
lay
bandaged
up
in
her
lap
under
the
table
mother
what
the
matter
with
your
hand
o
not
much
but
what
it
all
tied
up
have
you
burned
it
no
what
then
cut
yourself
i
should
like
to
know
how
i
should
go
to
work
to
cut
my
right
hand
do
make
a
fuss
about
nothing
diana
it
only
scalded
scalded
how
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
that
to
the
end
of
my
days
said
starling
if
pots
and
kettles
and
that
could
be
possessed
i
should
know
what
to
think
i
was
makin
strawberry
preserve
and
the
kettle
was
full
and
it
was
first
rate
preserve
and
boiling
and
almost
done
and
i
had
just
set
it
down
on
the
hearth
and
then
i
do
know
how
to
this
day
i
stumbled
i
do
know
over
what
and
my
arm
soused
right
in
boiling
sweetmeat
cried
diana
mother
let
me
see
it
must
be
dreadfully
burned
it
all
done
up
said
starling
coldly
i
was
real
put
out
about
my
preserves
have
you
had
dinner
i
never
found
i
could
live
eating
who
got
dinner
for
you
and
cleared
away
nobody
i
did
it
myself
for
the
men
and
all
well
do
count
to
live
without
eatin
no
mor
i
do
said
starling
with
a
short
laugh
and
you
did
it
with
one
hand
did
you
ever
know
me
to
stop
in
anything
i
had
to
do
for
want
of
a
hand
said
starling
scornfully
no
thought
diana
to
herself
nor
for
want
of
anything
else
even
though
it
were
right
or
conscience
aloud
she
only
said
i
must
go
home
to
baby
you
had
better
i
should
think
her
mother
broke
in
can
i
do
anything
for
you
first
you
can
see
for
yourself
there
is
nothing
to
do
shall
i
come
back
and
stay
with
you
you
had
better
ask
the
dominie
mother
he
wants
me
to
do
anything
but
just
what
is
right
diana
said
seriously
starling
lifted
up
her
head
and
gave
a
curious
searching
look
into
her
daughter
face
what
was
she
trying
to
find
that
one
turtle
dove
she
said
and
are
you
another
and
always
bob
your
head
when
he
bobs
diana
wondered
at
this
speech
it
seemed
to
her
her
mother
was
losing
ground
even
in
the
matter
of
language
no
thought
of
irritation
crossed
her
she
was
beyond
trifles
now
she
made
no
answer
she
merely
bade
her
mother
and
hurried
out
and
for
a
long
while
the
drive
was
again
in
silence
then
when
the
grey
horse
was
walking
up
a
hill
diana
spoke
in
a
meditative
sort
of
way
basil
you
said
enjoyment
was
not
the
end
of
life
did
i
he
answered
gravely
if
you
did
it
was
mother
bartlett
you
say
so
i
suppose
yes
it
is
not
the
end
of
life
what
is
then
to
do
the
will
of
god
and
by
and
by
if
not
sooner
enjoyment
comes
that
way
too
diana
and
when
it
comes
that
way
it
stays
and
lasts
how
long
for
ever
and
ever
diana
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
spoke
again
basil
i
want
to
consult
you
well
do
it
ought
i
to
leave
my
mother
to
live
alone
as
she
is
she
is
not
young
now
what
would
you
do
if
i
knew
basil
i
would
like
it
to
do
what
i
to
do
would
you
take
her
to
live
with
you
if
you
would
and
she
would
basil
put
his
arm
round
his
wife
and
bent
down
and
kissed
her
he
would
not
have
done
it
if
he
could
have
guessed
how
she
shrank
if
you
will
take
life
on
those
terms
he
said
then
it
will
be
true
for
you
that
may
endure
for
a
night
but
joy
cometh
in
the
morning
it
will
be
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
then
thought
diana
but
she
only
replied
what
basil
do
you
mean
doing
the
lord
will
his
will
is
always
good
diana
and
brings
sweet
fruit
only
you
must
wait
till
the
fruit
is
ripe
my
child
then
what
about
mother
i
do
not
believe
she
would
come
to
us
nor
i
suppose
she
would
let
us
come
to
her
then
i
would
go
if
you
wished
it
i
do
wish
it
basil
i
was
thinking
if
i
could
bear
it
but
the
thought
will
not
out
of
my
head
that
she
ought
not
to
be
alone
then
do
what
is
in
thine
heart
the
minister
said
cheerfully
chapter
xxxi
a
june
day
starling
hesitated
when
diana
proposed
her
plan
she
would
think
of
it
she
said
but
when
she
began
to
think
of
it
the
attractions
were
found
irresistible
to
have
her
grandchild
in
the
house
beside
her
perhaps
with
a
vague
thought
of
making
up
to
her
daughter
in
some
unexplained
way
for
the
wrong
she
had
done
at
any
rate
to
have
voices
and
life
in
the
house
again
instead
of
the
bare
silence
voices
of
people
that
belonged
to
her
own
blood
starling
found
that
she
could
not
give
up
the
idea
once
it
got
into
her
head
then
she
objected
that
the
house
was
too
small
the
minister
said
he
would
put
up
an
addition
of
a
couple
of
rooms
for
himself
and
diana
and
diana
old
room
could
serve
as
a
nursery
who
wants
a
nursery
starling
demanded
her
idea
of
a
nursery
was
the
whole
house
and
all
out
of
doors
the
minister
laughed
and
said
that
was
not
idea
and
starling
was
fain
to
let
it
pass
she
was
human
though
she
was
not
a
good
woman
and
diana
proposal
to
come
back
to
her
had
though
she
would
never
allow
it
even
to
herself
touched
both
her
heart
and
her
conscience
somewhere
very
deep
down
and
out
of
sight
nevertheless
it
was
true
and
it
was
true
that
she
had
been
very
lonely
and
she
let
the
minister
have
his
own
way
undisputed
about
the
building
the
carpenters
were
set
to
work
at
once
and
at
home
diana
quietly
made
preparations
for
a
removal
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
she
buried
herself
in
business
as
much
as
ever
she
could
to
still
thought
and
keep
her
nerves
quiet
for
constantly
daily
and
nightly
now
the
image
of
evan
was
before
her
and
the
possibility
that
he
might
any
day
present
himself
in
very
flesh
and
blood
no
precautions
were
of
any
avail
if
he
chose
to
seek
her
out
diana
could
not
escape
him
unless
by
leaving
pleasant
valley
and
that
was
not
possible
would
he
come
she
looked
at
that
question
from
every
possible
point
of
the
compass
and
from
every
one
the
view
that
presented
itself
was
that
he
would
come
nay
he
ought
not
it
would
be
worse
than
of
no
use
for
them
to
see
each
other
and
yet
something
in
diana
recollections
of
him
or
it
might
be
something
in
the
consciousness
of
her
own
nature
made
her
say
to
herself
that
he
would
come
how
should
she
bear
it
she
almost
wished
that
basil
would
forbid
it
and
take
measures
to
make
it
impossible
but
the
minister
went
his
way
unmoved
and
quiet
as
usual
there
was
neither
fear
nor
doubt
on
his
broad
fair
brow
diana
respected
him
immensely
and
at
times
felt
a
great
pang
of
grief
that
his
face
should
wear
such
a
shade
of
gravity
as
was
habitual
to
it
now
knowing
him
so
well
as
she
did
by
this
time
she
could
guess
that
though
the
gravity
never
degenerated
into
gloom
the
reason
was
to
be
found
solely
and
alone
in
the
fact
that
basil
inner
life
was
fed
by
springs
which
were
beyond
the
reach
of
earthly
impoverishing
or
disturbing
how
much
better
she
thought
him
than
herself
as
she
looked
at
the
calm
stedfast
beauty
of
his
countenance
which
matched
his
daily
life
and
walk
no
private
sorrow
touched
that
never
thinking
of
himself
nor
seeking
his
own
he
was
busy
from
morning
till
night
with
the
needs
of
others
going
from
house
to
house
carrying
help
showing
light
bringing
comfort
guiding
into
the
way
pointing
out
the
wrong
and
at
home
diana
knew
with
what
glad
resort
he
went
to
his
bible
and
prayer
for
his
own
help
and
wisdom
and
wrought
out
the
lessons
that
were
to
be
given
openly
in
the
little
hillside
church
diana
knew
too
what
flowers
of
blessings
were
springing
up
along
his
path
what
fruits
of
good
the
angel
of
the
church
in
pleasant
valley
he
was
in
a
sense
most
true
and
lovely
although
that
be
not
the
original
bearing
of
the
phrase
in
the
revelation
where
alford
thinks
and
i
think
no
human
angels
are
intended
nevertheless
that
was
basil
here
and
his
wife
who
did
not
love
him
honoured
him
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
in
her
and
her
humility
diana
wrote
bitterer
things
against
herself
than
there
was
any
need
for
she
too
was
doing
her
daily
work
with
a
lovely
truth
of
aim
and
simpleness
of
purpose
with
all
the
joys
of
life
crushed
out
she
was
walking
the
way
which
had
become
so
weary
with
a
steady
foot
and
with
hands
ready
and
diligent
to
do
all
they
found
to
do
in
another
sort
from
her
husband
the
fair
calm
grave
woman
was
the
angel
of
her
household
i
can
never
tell
you
how
beautiful
diana
was
now
if
the
careless
light
glance
of
the
girl
was
gone
there
was
now
instead
the
deeper
beauty
of
a
nature
that
has
loved
and
suffered
that
ripening
process
of
humanity
without
which
it
never
comes
to
its
full
bloom
and
fruitage
though
that
be
a
very
material
image
for
the
matter
in
hand
and
there
was
besides
in
diana
the
dignity
of
bearing
of
one
who
is
lifted
above
all
small
considerations
of
every
kind
that
is
not
above
small
duties
but
above
petty
interests
therefore
in
this
woman
who
had
never
seen
and
scarcely
imagined
courts
even
in
the
minister
house
in
pleasant
valley
there
was
the
calm
poise
and
grace
which
we
associate
in
our
speech
and
thoughts
with
the
highest
advantages
of
social
relations
so
extremes
sometimes
meet
in
diana
it
was
due
to
her
inborn
nobility
of
nature
and
the
sharp
discipline
of
sorrow
in
aid
of
which
practically
came
also
her
perfection
of
physical
health
and
form
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
she
had
been
now
for
a
good
while
in
the
close
companionship
of
a
man
of
great
refinement
and
culture
and
that
both
study
and
conversation
had
lifted
her
by
this
time
far
out
of
the
intellectual
sphere
in
which
the
beginning
of
our
story
found
her
the
carpenters
were
going
on
vigorously
with
their
work
on
the
new
rooms
adding
to
starling
house
and
diana
was
making
as
she
could
from
time
to
time
her
little
preparations
for
the
removal
which
however
could
not
take
place
yet
for
some
time
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
july
diana
was
one
day
looking
over
the
contents
of
a
trunk
and
cutting
up
pieces
for
patchwork
windows
were
open
of
course
and
the
scent
of
new
hay
came
in
with
the
warm
air
haymaking
was
going
on
all
over
pleasant
valley
by
and
by
miss
collins
put
her
head
in
be
you
fixed
to
see
folks
who
wants
me
well
there
somebody
comin
and
i
reckon
it
one
or
other
o
them
from
elmfield
here
said
diana
starting
up
and
trembling
wall
there
one
of
comin
i
guess
i
see
the
carriage
and
i
thought
maybe
you
war
ready
to
see
no
one
when
one
gets
into
a
trunk
it
hard
to
get
out
again
so
i
thought
i
jes
come
and
tell
ye
there
she
is
comin
up
the
walk
hurry
now
down
went
miss
collins
to
let
the
visitor
in
and
diana
did
hurry
and
changed
her
dress
what
can
she
be
come
for
she
questioned
with
herself
meanwhile
for
it
was
reverdy
she
had
seen
no
good
no
good
but
nobody
would
have
guessed
that
diana
had
ever
been
in
a
hurry
that
saw
her
entrance
the
next
minute
upon
her
visitor
that
little
lady
felt
a
sort
of
imposing
effect
and
did
not
quite
know
how
to
do
what
she
had
come
for
i
always
think
there
has
come
some
witchery
over
my
eyes
she
said
with
her
invariable
little
laugh
of
ingratiation
when
i
see
you
i
always
feel
a
kind
of
new
surprise
is
it
the
minister
that
has
changed
you
so
what
he
done
changed
me
diana
repeated
why
yes
you
are
changed
you
are
not
like
what
you
were
two
years
ago
three
years
ago
how
long
is
it
it
is
three
years
ago
said
diana
trying
to
smile
i
am
three
years
older
o
it
is
that
three
years
older
i
suppose
i
did
see
enough
of
you
then
to
find
you
out
it
was
my
fault
but
if
you
had
married
somebody
belonging
to
me
i
can
tell
you
i
should
have
been
very
proud
of
my
she
laughed
at
the
compliment
she
was
making
laughed
lightly
while
diana
inwardly
shook
like
a
person
who
has
received
a
sudden
sharp
blow
and
staggers
in
danger
of
losing
his
footing
did
she
waver
visibly
before
her
adversary
eyes
she
wondered
she
was
sure
her
colour
did
not
change
she
found
nothing
to
say
in
any
case
and
after
a
moment
her
vision
cleared
and
she
had
possession
of
herself
again
i
am
saucy
said
reverdy
smiling
but
nobody
thinks
of
minding
anything
i
say
that
the
good
of
being
little
and
insignificant
as
i
am
diana
was
inclined
to
wish
her
visitor
would
not
presume
upon
her
harmlessness
i
should
as
soon
think
of
being
rude
to
a
duchess
reverdy
went
on
or
to
a
princess
i
do
see
how
evan
ever
made
up
his
mind
to
go
away
and
leave
you
is
it
worse
to
be
rude
to
a
duchess
than
to
other
people
diana
asked
seizing
the
first
part
of
this
speech
as
a
means
to
get
over
the
last
i
never
tried
said
reverdy
i
never
had
the
opportunity
you
know
i
might
have
danced
with
the
prince
of
wales
perhaps
when
he
was
here
i
know
a
lady
who
did
and
she
said
she
was
afraid
of
if
you
had
been
there
i
am
sure
she
would
not
have
got
the
chance
you
forget
i
am
not
a
dancer
o
not
now
of
course
but
then
you
would
have
been
a
wife
why
should
not
a
minister
wife
dance
as
well
as
other
people
o
i
do
know
said
reverdy
lightly
but
they
never
do
you
know
they
are
obliged
to
set
an
example
of
what
of
everything
that
is
proper
i
suppose
do
you
feel
that
everybody
eyes
are
upon
you
always
watching
everything
you
do
a
good
reminder
but
diana
answered
simply
that
she
never
thought
about
it
do
you
is
the
minister
always
reminding
you
of
what
people
will
think
no
it
is
his
way
does
he
why
without
being
a
minister
that
is
what
my
husband
used
always
to
be
doing
to
me
i
was
a
little
giddy
you
know
said
reverdy
laughing
i
was
very
young
and
i
used
to
have
plenty
of
admonitions
i
believe
masters
thinks
we
should
only
care
about
god
eyes
diana
said
quietly
reverdy
startled
a
little
at
that
and
for
a
moment
looked
grave
from
diana
she
had
not
expected
this
turn
i
never
think
about
anything
she
said
then
with
a
laugh
that
looked
as
if
it
were
meant
to
be
one
of
childlike
ingenuousness
do
think
me
very
bad
everybody
ca
be
good
and
discreet
like
you
and
mr
masters
very
few
people
are
like
masters
diana
assented
we
all
know
that
and
in
the
daily
beholding
of
his
superiority
have
you
quite
forgotten
everything
else
your
old
lover
and
all
whom
do
you
mean
diana
asked
with
a
calm
coldness
at
which
she
wondered
herself
i
mean
evan
to
be
sure
you
know
he
was
your
old
lover
he
wants
to
see
you
he
has
not
forgotten
you
at
any
rate
have
you
entirely
forgotten
him
poor
fellow
he
has
had
a
hard
time
of
it
i
have
not
forgotten
knowlton
at
all
diana
said
with
difficulty
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
throat
was
suddenly
paralyzed
you
have
not
forgotten
him
i
may
tell
him
that
do
you
know
he
raves
about
you
i
wish
you
could
hear
him
once
he
is
captain
knowlton
now
you
must
understand
he
has
got
his
advancement
early
but
one
or
two
people
died
and
somebody
else
was
removed
out
of
his
way
and
so
he
stepped
into
his
captaincy
lucky
fellow
he
always
has
been
lucky
except
just
in
one
thing
and
he
thinks
that
spoils
all
may
he
come
and
see
you
diana
he
has
given
me
no
peace
until
i
would
come
and
ask
you
and
he
will
never
have
any
peace
that
i
can
see
if
you
refuse
him
poor
fellow
there
he
is
out
there
all
this
time
champing
the
bit
worse
than
the
horses
and
the
woman
said
it
all
with
her
little
civil
smile
and
laugh
as
if
she
were
talking
about
sugar
plums
is
he
here
cried
diana
with
the
horses
waiting
to
know
the
success
of
my
mission
and
i
have
been
afraid
to
ask
you
for
fear
you
should
say
no
and
i
carry
back
such
an
answer
to
him
may
i
tell
him
to
come
in
why
should
not
he
come
to
see
me
as
well
as
any
other
friend
said
diana
but
the
quiver
in
her
voice
gave
the
answer
to
her
own
question
of
course
said
reverdy
rising
with
a
satisfied
face
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
not
if
you
have
kindness
enough
left
for
him
to
let
him
come
then
i
go
out
and
tell
him
to
come
in
for
the
poor
fellow
is
sitting
on
sword
points
all
this
while
and
laughing
at
her
supposed
happy
professional
allusion
the
lady
withdrew
diana
flew
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
she
did
not
debate
much
the
question
whether
she
ought
to
see
evan
it
came
to
her
rather
as
a
thing
that
she
do
there
was
no
question
in
the
case
however
perhaps
the
question
only
lay
very
deep
down
in
her
consciousness
for
the
justification
presented
itself
that
to
refuse
to
see
him
would
be
to
confess
both
to
his
sister
and
himself
that
there
was
danger
in
it
diana
never
could
confess
that
whatever
the
fact
so
answering
dumbly
the
doubt
that
was
as
wordless
without
stopping
a
moment
she
caught
up
her
sleeping
baby
out
of
its
cradle
and
drawing
the
cradle
after
her
went
into
her
husband
study
basil
was
there
she
knew
at
work
he
looked
up
as
she
came
in
diana
drew
the
cradle
near
to
him
and
carefully
laid
the
still
sleeping
fair
and
fat
little
bundle
from
her
arms
down
in
it
again
this
was
done
gently
and
deliberately
enough
no
hurry
and
no
perturbation
then
she
stood
upright
basil
will
you
take
care
of
her
he
is
come
the
minister
looked
up
into
his
wife
face
he
knew
what
she
meant
and
he
felt
as
he
looked
at
her
how
far
she
was
from
him
there
was
no
smile
on
diana
lips
indeed
on
the
contrary
an
intensity
of
feelings
that
were
not
pleasurable
and
yet
and
yet
he
who
has
looked
for
the
light
of
love
in
an
eye
and
missed
it
long
knows
it
when
he
sees
it
even
though
it
be
not
for
him
the
four
eyes
met
each
other
steadily
shall
i
see
him
diana
asked
basil
stretched
out
his
hand
to
her
i
can
trust
you
diana
she
put
her
cold
hand
in
his
for
a
minute
and
hurried
away
then
as
she
reached
the
other
room
she
heard
in
the
hall
below
a
step
the
step
she
had
not
heard
for
years
and
her
heart
made
one
spring
back
over
the
interval
in
the
urgency
of
action
diana
colour
had
hardly
changed
until
now
now
she
turned
deadly
white
and
for
one
instant
sank
on
her
knees
by
her
bedside
with
her
heart
full
of
a
mute
unformed
prayer
for
help
it
was
fearful
to
go
on
but
she
must
go
on
now
she
must
see
evan
he
was
there
questions
were
done
and
as
she
went
while
her
face
was
white
and
pain
almost
confused
her
senses
there
was
a
stir
of
keen
joy
at
her
heart
fierce
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
which
has
been
robbed
of
its
prey
but
has
got
it
again
she
tried
for
and
as
one
mean
towards
it
forced
herself
to
go
deliberately
no
hasty
steps
should
be
heard
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
floor
even
so
the
way
was
short
a
moment
and
she
had
entered
the
room
and
she
and
evan
were
face
to
face
once
more
face
to
face
and
yet
neither
dared
look
at
the
other
he
was
standing
waiting
for
her
she
came
a
few
paces
into
the
room
and
stood
still
opposite
him
they
did
not
touch
each
other
hands
they
made
no
show
of
greeting
how
should
they
in
each
other
presence
indeed
they
were
with
but
a
small
space
of
transparent
air
between
to
the
sense
and
yet
a
barrier
mountains
high
of
impassible
ice
to
the
apprehension
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
the
room
the
two
stood
there
a
few
yards
apart
not
even
looking
at
each
other
yet
intensely
conscious
each
all
the
while
of
the
familiar
outlines
and
traits
so
long
unseen
so
well
known
by
heart
breathing
the
air
of
the
same
room
again
and
nevertheless
miles
and
miles
apart
that
was
what
they
were
feeling
the
miles
could
not
be
bridged
over
what
use
to
try
to
bridge
over
the
yards
diana
was
growing
whiter
if
whiter
could
be
evan
head
sank
lower
at
last
the
man
succumbed
sat
down
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
diana
stood
like
a
statue
but
looking
at
him
now
what
is
it
in
little
things
which
has
such
power
over
us
as
diana
stood
there
looking
it
was
little
things
which
stabbed
her
as
if
each
were
a
sharp
sword
the
set
of
evan
shoulders
the
waves
of
his
hair
the
very
gold
on
the
blue
uniform
undress
his
cap
which
lay
on
her
table
with
its
service
symbols
is
it
that
the
sameness
of
these
material
trifles
seems
to
assert
that
nothing
is
changed
and
so
makes
the
change
more
incredible
and
dreadful
i
can
not
describe
the
woful
pain
which
the
sight
of
these
things
gave
diana
with
them
came
the
fresh
remembrance
of
all
the
manly
beauty
and
grace
of
evan
in
which
she
had
once
sunned
herself
and
the
contrast
of
her
husband
not
that
basil
personal
appearance
was
ever
to
be
despised
any
more
than
himself
his
figure
was
good
and
his
face
had
a
beauty
of
its
own
possibly
a
higher
kind
of
beauty
but
it
was
not
the
type
of
a
hero
of
romance
and
evan
to
fancy
and
it
had
been
her
romance
she
stood
still
motionless
breathless
if
anybody
spoke
it
must
be
he
but
at
last
she
trembled
too
much
to
stand
and
she
sat
down
too
how
has
it
happened
diana
evan
asked
without
looking
up
i
do
know
she
said
just
above
her
breath
how
could
you
do
so
well
it
suited
him
well
to
reproach
her
what
matter
things
could
not
be
more
bitter
than
they
were
she
did
not
try
to
answer
you
have
ruined
both
our
lives
is
ruined
i
am
ruined
i
shall
never
be
worth
anything
now
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
as
she
still
did
not
answer
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
once
meeting
they
could
not
quit
each
other
diana
gaze
was
sad
enough
but
eager
with
the
eagerness
of
long
hunger
his
was
sharp
with
pain
at
first
keen
with
unreasonable
anger
one
of
the
mind
resorts
from
unbearable
torment
then
as
he
looked
it
changed
and
grew
soft
and
finally
springing
up
he
went
over
to
where
she
sat
dropped
on
his
knees
before
her
and
seizing
her
hands
kissed
them
one
after
the
other
till
tears
began
to
mingle
with
the
kisses
she
was
passive
she
could
not
drive
him
off
she
felt
that
she
and
he
must
have
this
one
moment
to
bury
their
past
in
it
was
only
when
her
hands
were
growing
wet
with
his
tears
that
she
roused
herself
to
an
effort
evan
evan
listen
to
me
you
must
remember
i
am
a
man
wife
how
could
you
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
have
you
given
up
loving
me
what
is
the
use
of
talking
of
it
evan
i
am
another
man
wife
but
there
are
such
things
as
divorces
hush
do
not
speak
of
such
a
thing
i
must
speak
of
it
whom
do
you
love
tell
me
that
first
no
one
has
a
right
to
ask
me
such
a
question
have
a
right
cried
the
young
man
for
i
have
been
deceived
cheated
robbed
of
my
own
and
i
have
a
right
to
get
back
my
own
diana
speak
do
you
love
me
less
than
you
used
to
do
tell
me
that
i
do
not
change
evan
then
you
have
no
business
to
be
anybody
wife
but
mine
nothing
can
hinder
diana
stop
you
are
not
to
speak
so
i
will
not
hear
it
you
are
mine
diana
i
yours
evan
she
said
tenderly
bending
her
head
over
him
till
her
lips
touched
his
hair
we
have
been
parted
and
it
is
over
over
for
this
world
you
must
go
your
way
and
i
must
go
mine
and
you
must
not
say
i
am
ruined
do
not
you
say
it
i
must
not
it
is
the
truth
for
me
if
i
do
not
have
you
with
me
it
is
not
the
truth
she
said
with
infinite
tenderness
in
her
manner
not
ruined
evan
we
can
go
our
way
and
do
our
work
even
if
we
are
not
happy
is
another
thing
then
you
are
not
happy
he
said
eagerly
diana
did
not
reply
why
should
we
not
be
happy
he
went
on
passionately
looking
up
now
into
her
face
you
are
mine
diana
you
belonged
to
me
first
you
have
been
mine
all
along
only
i
have
been
robbed
of
you
pure
robbery
nothing
else
and
has
not
a
man
a
right
to
his
own
wherever
and
whenever
he
finds
it
you
had
given
yourself
first
to
me
that
is
irrevocable
no
she
said
with
the
same
gentleness
in
every
tone
of
which
lurked
an
unutterable
sorrow
it
would
have
broken
her
husband
heart
to
hear
her
and
yet
she
was
quiet
so
quiet
that
she
awed
the
young
officer
a
little
no
i
had
promised
to
give
myself
to
you
that
is
all
you
gave
me
your
heart
di
she
was
silent
for
at
the
moment
she
could
not
speak
di
he
insisted
yes
that
is
enough
that
is
all
it
is
not
all
since
then
i
have
how
could
you
do
it
diana
how
could
you
do
it
after
your
heart
was
mine
your
heart
was
mine
i
was
dead
she
said
in
the
same
low
slow
impressive
way
i
thought
i
was
dead
and
that
it
did
not
matter
any
more
what
i
did
one
way
or
another
i
thought
i
was
dead
and
when
i
found
out
that
there
was
life
in
me
yet
it
was
too
late
a
slight
shudder
ran
over
her
shoulders
which
evan
however
did
not
see
and
you
doubted
me
said
he
i
heard
nothing
of
course
and
that
was
enough
to
make
you
think
i
was
nothing
but
a
featherhead
i
thought
i
was
not
good
enough
for
you
she
said
softly
not
good
enough
cried
evan
when
you
are
just
a
pearl
of
perfection
a
diamond
of
loveliness
more
than
all
i
knew
you
would
be
like
a
queen
rather
than
like
a
common
mortal
and
i
could
have
given
you
a
place
fit
for
you
and
here
you
are
hush
she
said
softly
but
it
stopped
him
did
you
never
hear
from
me
i
wrote
and
wrote
and
o
diana
how
i
looked
for
something
from
you
i
walked
miles
on
the
way
to
meet
the
waggon
that
brought
our
mails
i
could
hardly
do
my
duty
or
eat
or
sleep
at
last
i
would
ride
then
to
meet
the
though
it
did
not
help
me
for
i
could
not
open
the
bags
till
they
were
brought
into
the
post
and
then
i
used
to
go
and
gallop
thirty
miles
to
ride
away
from
myself
did
you
never
write
one
word
i
did
not
know
your
address
she
said
faintly
i
gave
it
you
over
and
over
you
forget
i
never
got
the
letters
what
became
of
them
i
do
know
what
was
her
motive
i
suppose
i
do
know
what
do
you
suppose
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
it
evan
my
poor
darling
said
he
looking
up
in
her
face
again
it
has
been
hard
on
you
too
oh
di
my
di
i
can
not
lose
you
he
was
still
kneeling
before
her
and
she
put
her
two
hands
on
his
head
smoothing
or
rather
pushing
back
the
short
locks
from
his
temples
on
either
side
looking
as
one
looks
one
last
on
what
one
loves
her
eyes
were
dry
and
large
with
pain
which
did
not
allow
the
eyelids
their
usual
droop
her
mouth
was
in
the
saddest
lines
a
woman
lips
can
take
but
they
did
not
tremble
hush
she
said
again
softly
i
am
lost
to
you
that
is
over
now
go
and
do
a
man
work
in
the
world
and
if
i
hear
of
you
let
me
hear
good
have
you
got
one
kiss
for
me
she
bent
lower
down
and
kissed
his
brow
she
kissed
it
twice
but
the
manner
of
the
woman
was
of
such
high
and
pure
dignity
that
the
young
officer
who
would
else
have
had
no
scruple
did
not
dare
presume
upon
it
he
took
no
more
than
she
gave
bent
his
head
again
when
she
took
her
hands
away
and
covered
his
face
as
at
first
they
were
both
still
awhile
evan
you
must
go
she
whispered
when
may
i
come
again
she
did
not
answer
i
am
coming
very
soon
again
di
i
must
see
you
often
i
must
see
you
very
often
while
i
am
here
i
can
not
live
if
i
do
not
see
you
i
do
not
see
how
i
can

diana
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
her
and
she
laid
hers
within
it
the
first
time
that
day
the
first
time
since
so
many
days
hands
lingered
were
slow
to
unclasp
loath
to
leave
the
touch
which
was
such
exquisite
pain
and
pleasure
at
once
then
without
looking
again
slowly
deliberately
as
all
her
movements
had
been
made
diana
withdrew
from
the
room
not
bearing
perhaps
to
stay
and
have
him
leave
her
or
doubting
of
her
power
to
make
him
go
or
unable
to
endure
anything
more
for
this
time
she
left
him
standing
there
and
slowly
went
up
the
stairs
but
the
moment
she
got
to
her
room
she
stopped
and
stood
with
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
heart
listening
every
particle
of
colour
vanishing
from
her
face
and
her
eyes
taking
a
strained
look
of
despair
listening
to
the
footsteps
that
also
slowly
now
went
through
the
hall
when
they
went
out
and
had
quitted
the
house
she
flew
to
the
window
she
watched
to
see
the
stately
figure
go
along
the
little
walk
and
out
at
the
gate
she
had
hardly
dared
to
look
at
him
now
her
eye
sought
out
every
line
and
trait
with
an
eagerness
like
the
madness
of
thirst
yes
he
had
grown
broader
in
the
shoulders
his
frame
was
developed
he
had
become
more
manly
and
so
even
finer
in
appearance
than
ever
without
meaning
it
diana
drew
comparisons
how
well
he
walked
what
a
firm
sure
graceful
gait
how
beloved
of
old
time
was
the
officer
undress
coat
and
the
little
cap
which
reminded
diana
so
inevitably
of
the
time
when
it
was
at
home
on
her
table
or
lying
on
a
chair
near
only
for
a
minute
or
two
she
tasted
the
pang
of
associations
and
then
cap
and
wearer
were
passed
from
her
sight
chapter
xxxii
wind
and
tide
how
that
night
went
by
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
tell
some
things
can
not
be
described
a
loosing
of
all
the
bands
of
law
and
order
in
the
material
world
we
call
chaos
and
once
in
a
while
the
mental
nature
of
some
poor
mortal
falls
for
a
time
into
a
like
condition
no
hold
of
anything
not
even
of
herself
no
clear
sense
of
anything
except
of
the
disorder
and
pain
no
hope
at
the
moment
that
could
fasten
on
either
world
the
present
or
the
future
no
will
to
lay
hold
of
the
unruly
forces
within
her
and
reduce
them
to
obedience
an
awful
night
for
diana
such
as
she
never
had
spent
nor
in
its
full
measure
would
ever
spend
again
nevertheless
through
all
the
confusion
under
all
the
tumult
there
was
one
fixed
point
indeed
it
was
the
point
round
which
all
the
confusion
worked
and
which
diana
was
dimly
conscious
of
all
the
while
one
point
of
action
at
the
time
she
could
not
steady
herself
to
look
at
it
but
when
the
dawn
came
up
in
the
sky
with
its
ineffable
promise
of
victory
by
and
by
and
when
the
rays
of
the
sun
broke
over
the
hills
with
their
golden
performance
of
conquest
begun
strength
seemed
to
come
into
her
heart
certainly
light
has
no
fellowship
with
darkness
and
the
spiritual
and
the
material
are
more
closely
allied
perhaps
than
we
wot
of
diana
washed
herself
and
dressed
and
felt
that
she
had
done
with
yesterday
it
was
a
worn
and
haggard
face
that
was
opposite
basil
at
the
breakfast
table
but
she
sat
there
and
poured
out
his
tea
with
not
less
care
than
usual
except
for
cups
of
tea
the
meal
was
not
much
more
than
a
pretence
after
it
was
done
diana
followed
her
husband
to
his
study
basil
she
said
i
must
go
away
masters
started
and
asked
what
she
meant
i
mean
just
that
said
diana
i
must
go
away
basil
help
me
help
you
my
child
said
he
i
will
help
you
all
i
can
but
sit
down
diana
you
are
not
able
to
stand
why
do
you
want
to
go
away
i
must
where
do
you
wish
to
go
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
care
anywhere
you
have
no
plan
no
only
to
get
away
why
diana
he
said
very
tenderly
is
it
necessary
yes
basil
i
must
go
do
you
know
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
leave
home
just
at
present
there
are
so
many
people
wanting
me
i
know
that
i
have
thought
of
all
that
you
can
not
go
let
me
go
and
baby
where
my
dear
i
do
know
she
said
with
almost
a
sob
you
must
know
you
must
help
me
basil
basil
looked
at
her
and
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
room
in
sorrow
and
perplexity
what
is
your
reason
di
he
asked
gently
if
i
understood
your
thought
better
i
should
know
better
how
to
meet
it
i
must
be
away
said
diana
vaguely
i
must
not
be
here
i
mus
be
where
i
can
see
anybody
nobody
must
know
where
i
am
basil
do
you
understand
you
must
send
me
away
and
you
must
not
tell
the
minister
walked
up
and
down
thinking
he
let
go
entirely
the
thought
of
arguing
with
diana
she
had
the
look
at
moments
of
a
creature
driven
to
bay
and
when
not
so
the
haggard
eager
appealing
face
filled
his
inmost
heart
with
grief
and
pity
nobody
better
than
basil
could
manage
the
unreasonable
and
bring
the
disorderly
to
obedience
he
had
a
magical
way
with
him
but
now
he
only
meditated
how
diana
wish
was
to
be
met
it
was
not
just
easy
for
he
had
few
family
connections
in
the
world
and
she
had
none
i
can
think
of
nobody
to
whom
i
should
like
to
send
you
he
said
unless
he
waited
and
diana
waited
then
he
finished
his
sentence
i
was
going
to
say
unless
a
certain
old
grandaunt
of
mine
perhaps
she
would
do
i
do
not
care
where
or
who
it
is
said
diana
i
care
though
where
does
she
live
on
staten
island
staten
island
repeated
diana
yes
it
is
near
new
york
about
an
hour
from
the
city
down
the
bay
the
bay
of
new
york
yes
may
i
go
there
said
diana
that
would
do
how
soon
do
you
wish
to
go
if
i
could
she
said
with
a
breath
can
i
basil
is
best
masters
considered
again
will
you
be
ready
to
go
by
the
seven
train
this
evening
yes
o
yes
very
well
we
will
take
that
diana
repeated
must
i
take
you
basil
away
from
your
work
can
not
i
go
alone
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
very
sweet
grave
smile
as
he
answered
not
possibly
i
am
a
great
deal
of
trouble
she
said
with
a
woful
expression
go
and
make
your
preparations
he
said
cheerfully
and
i
will
tell
you
about
aunt
sutphen
when
we
are
off
there
was
no
bustle
in
the
house
that
day
there
was
no
undue
stir
of
making
arrangements
but
at
the
time
appointed
diana
was
ready
she
had
managed
to
keep
miss
collins
in
the
dark
down
to
the
very
last
minute
and
answered
her
questions
then
with
i
ca
tell
you
you
must
ask
mr
masters
and
diana
knew
anybody
might
as
well
get
the
great
pyramid
to
disclose
its
secrets
that
night
train
took
them
to
boston
the
next
morning
they
went
on
their
way
towards
new
york
and
so
far
masters
had
found
no
good
time
for
his
proposed
explanations
diana
was
busied
with
the
baby
and
contrived
to
keep
herself
away
from
him
or
from
communication
with
him
he
saw
that
she
was
engrossed
preoccupied
suffering
and
that
she
shunned
him
and
he
fell
back
and
waited
in
new
york
he
established
diana
in
a
hotel
and
left
her
to
go
himself
alone
to
the
island
and
have
an
interview
with
his
aunt
diana
alone
in
a
broadway
hotel
felt
a
little
like
a
person
shipwrecked
in
what
was
all
this
bustling
restless
driving
multitude
around
her
like
but
the
waves
of
the
sea
to
which
scripture
likens
them
and
the
roar
of
their
tumult
almost
bewildered
her
senses
proverbially
there
is
no
situation
more
lonely
to
the
feeling
than
the
midst
of
a
strange
crowd
and
diana
sitting
at
her
window
and
looking
down
into
the
busy
street
felt
alone
and
cast
adrift
as
she
never
had
felt
in
her
life
before
life
seemed
done
finished
as
far
as
regarded
hope
or
joy
nothing
left
but
weary
and
dragging
existence
and
the
eager
hurrying
hither
and
thither
of
the
city
crowd
struck
on
her
view
as
aimless
and
fruitless
and
so
very
drear
to
look
at
what
was
it
all
for
seeing
life
was
such
a
thing
as
she
had
found
it
the
wrench
of
coming
away
from
pleasant
valley
had
left
her
with
a
reaction
of
dull
stunned
and
strained
nerves
she
was
glad
she
had
come
away
glad
she
was
no
longer
there
and
that
was
the
only
thing
she
was
glad
of
in
the
wide
wide
world
some
degree
of
rest
came
with
the
quiet
of
those
hours
alone
in
the
hotel
basil
was
gone
until
the
evening
and
diana
had
time
to
recover
a
little
from
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
and
in
the
perfect
solitude
also
from
the
overstrain
of
the
nerves
she
began
to
remember
part
in
all
this
and
to
be
sensible
how
true
and
faithful
and
kind
he
was
how
very
unselfish
how
patient
with
her
and
with
pain
diana
could
have
wept
her
heart
out
over
it
if
that
would
have
done
any
good
and
indeed
supposing
that
she
could
have
shed
tears
at
all
which
she
could
not
just
then
she
only
felt
sore
and
sorry
for
her
husband
and
then
she
took
some
pains
with
her
toilet
and
refreshed
herself
so
as
to
look
pleasant
to
his
eyes
when
he
came
home
he
came
home
only
to
a
late
supper
he
looked
somewhat
weary
but
his
eye
brightened
when
he
saw
diana
and
he
came
up
and
kissed
her
diana
god
is
good
he
said
to
her
yes
she
answered
looking
up
drearily
i
believe
it
but
you
do
not
feel
it
yet
well
remember
it
is
true
and
you
will
feel
it
some
day
it
is
all
right
with
aunt
sutphen
she
will
let
me
come
she
is
glad
to
have
you
come
the
old
lady
is
very
much
alone
and
she
does
me
the
honour
to
say
that
she
expects
my
wife
will
know
how
to
behave
herself
what
does
she
mean
by
that
said
diana
a
little
startled
i
do
know
aunt
sutphen
has
her
own
notions
respecting
behaviour
i
did
not
inquire
diana
knowing
that
whatever
her
meaning
might
be
it
was
the
same
thing
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
basil
you
are
very
good
diana
said
after
a
pause
and
with
a
trembling
lip
i
can
take
compliments
from
aunt
sutphen
he
said
with
a
bit
of
his
old
dry
humorous
manner
but
from
you
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
them
come
to
supper
di
we
must
take
the
first
boat
for
clifton
morning
if
we
can
to
let
me
get
back
on
my
way
to
pleasant
valley
the
first
boat
was
very
early
the
city
however
had
long
begun
its
accustomed
roar
so
that
the
change
was
noticeable
and
pleasant
as
soon
as
the
breadth
of
a
few
furlongs
was
put
between
the
boat
and
the
wharf
stillness
fell
only
excepting
the
noise
made
by
the
dash
of
the
and
the
breathing
and
groaning
of
the
engine
and
that
seemed
quietness
to
diana
in
contrast
with
the
restless
hum
and
roar
of
the
living
multitude
the
bay
and
its
shores
sparkled
in
the
early
sunlight
the
sultry
heated
atmosphere
of
the
city
was
most
refreshingly
replaced
by
the
cool
air
from
the
salt
sea
diana
breathed
it
in
filling
her
lungs
with
it
how
good
this
is
she
said
basil
i
should
think
it
was
dreadful
to
live
in
such
a
place
as
that
makes
less
difference
than
you
would
think
when
you
once
get
accustomed
to
it
o
do
you
think
so
it
seems
to
me
there
is
nothing
pleasant
there
to
see
or
to
hear
ay
you
are
a
true
said
her
husband
but
there
is
plenty
to
do
in
a
city
diana
and
that
is
the
main
thing
so
there
is
in
the
country
i
sometimes
think
i
might
do
more
reach
more
people
i
mean
if
i
were
somewhere
else
but
yes
di
i
grant
you
apart
from
that
one
consideration
there
is
no
comparison
green
hills
are
a
great
deal
better
company
than
hot
brick
walls
and
how
wonderful
how
beautiful
this
water
is
the
water
is
a
new
feature
to
you
well
you
will
have
plenty
of
it
aunt
sutphen
lives
just
on
the
edge
of
the
shore
i
am
very
sorry
i
can
not
stay
to
see
you
domesticated
do
you
mind
it
much
beginning
here
alone
o
no
diana
did
not
mind
that
or
anything
else
in
her
content
at
having
reached
a
safe
harbour
a
place
where
she
would
be
both
secure
and
free
lesser
things
were
of
no
account
and
alas
the
presence
of
her
husband
just
now
with
her
was
no
pleasure
diana
felt
at
this
time
that
if
she
were
to
live
and
keep
her
reason
she
must
have
breathing
space
above
all
things
she
desired
to
be
quite
alone
to
have
leisure
to
think
and
pray
and
review
her
ground
and
set
up
her
defences
basil
could
not
help
her
he
was
better
out
of
sight
so
when
he
had
put
her
into
the
little
carriage
that
was
in
waiting
at
the
landing
and
with
a
last
gesture
of
greeting
turned
back
to
the
boat
while
diana
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
was
nevertheless
nothing
but
glad
at
heart
she
gathered
her
baby
closer
in
her
arms
and
sat
back
in
the
carriage
and
waited
it
was
only
a
short
drive
and
along
the
edge
of
the
bay
the
whole
distance
the
smell
of
the
salt
water
was
strange
and
delicious
the
morning
was
still
cool
now
that
she
had
left
the
boat
behind
her
or
rather
the
boat
had
left
her
the
stillness
began
to
be
like
that
of
pleasant
valley
for
the
light
wheels
rolled
softly
over
a
smooth
road
then
they
stopped
before
a
low
cottage
it
was
low
and
plain
yet
it
was
light
and
pleasant
windows
opening
like
doors
upon
the
piazza
and
the
piazza
running
all
round
the
house
and
the
pillars
of
the
piazza
wreathed
thick
with
honeysuckles
some
of
them
and
some
with
climbing
roses
the
breath
of
the
salt
air
was
smothered
in
perfumes
through
one
of
the
open
diana
went
into
a
matted
room
where
everything
gave
her
the
instant
impression
of
neatness
and
coolness
and
quiet
and
a
certain
sweet
summer
freshness
which
suited
her
exactly
there
was
no
attempt
at
richness
of
furnishing
yet
the
old
lady
who
stood
there
waiting
to
receive
her
was
a
stately
lady
enough
in
a
spotless
morning
dress
of
white
dainty
and
ruffled
and
a
little
close
embroidered
cap
above
her
clustering
grey
curls
the
two
looked
at
each
other
so
you
his
wife
said
the
elder
lady

declare
you
handsomer
than
he
is
come
in
here
my
dear
if
you
are
as
good
as
he
is

are
welcome
she
opened
an
inner
door
and
led
the
way
into
a
bedchamber
adjoining
opening
like
the
other
room
by
upon
the
piazza
matted
and
cool
and
furnished
in
white
all
this
diana
took
in
with
the
first
step
into
the
room
but
she
answered
sutphen
peculiar
welcome
did
you
ever
know
anybody
so
good
as
he
is
breakfast
will
be
on
table
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
sutphen
went
on
without
heeding
her
words
it
is
seven
and
i
always
have
it
at
seven
i
waited
for
you
and
now
i
want
my
cup
of
tea
how
soon
will
you
be
ready
immediately
what
will
you
do
with
the
baby
i
will
lay
her
down
she
is
asleep
you
have
to
have
somebody
to
look
after
her
well
come
then
my
dear
diana
followed
the
old
lady
who
was
half
imperative
and
half
impatient
she
never
forgot
that
hour
in
all
her
life
everything
was
so
new
and
strange
the
windows
open
towards
the
water
the
fresh
salt
air
coming
in
the
india
matting
under
her
feet
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
got
into
a
new
world
the
dishes
were
also
in
part
strange
to
her
and
her
only
companion
fully
strange
the
good
cup
of
tea
she
received
was
almost
the
only
familiar
thing
for
the
very
bread
was
like
no
bread
she
had
ever
seen
before
diana
sipped
her
tea
gratefully
all
this
novelty
was
the
most
welcome
thing
in
the
world
to
her
overstrained
nerves
she
sipped
her
tea
as
in
a
dream
the
old
lady
studied
her
with
eyes
wide
awake
and
practical
where
did
basil
pick
you
up
my
dear
diana
started
a
little
looked
up
and
flushed
where
did
you
come
from
from
the
place
where
masters
has
been
settled
these
three
or
four
years
in
the
mountains
what
sort
of
people
have
you
got
there
more
of
your
sort
they
are
all
of
my
sort
said
diana
somewhat
wonderingly
do
you
know
what
your
sort
is
my
dear
i
do
not
understand
i
thought
you
did
not
i
change
my
question
what
sort
of
work
is
basil
doing
there
you
know
his
profession
diana
said
not
knowing
much
better
either
how
to
take
this
question
yes
yes
i
know
his
profession
i
ought
to
for
i
wanted
him
to
be
a
lawyer
but
do
you
know
my
dear
there
are
all
sorts
of
clergymen
there
are
some
make
sermons
as
other
men
make
bricks
and
some
more
like
the
way
children
blow
all
they
care
for
is
how
big
they
are
and
how
high
they
will
fly
and
how
long
they
will
last
and
i
have
heard
people
preach
the
old
lady
went
on
who
seemed
most
like
as
if
they
were
laying
out
a
chinese
puzzle
and
you
had
to
look
sharp
to
see
where
the
pieces
fitted
and
some
again
preach
sermons
as
if
they
were
a
magistrate
reading
the
riot
act
only
they
do
want
the
people
to
disperse
by
any
means
what
is
basil
way
he
has
more
ways
than
all
these
said
diana
who
could
not
help
smiling
these
among
i
think
not
go
on
then
and
tell
me
what
he
like
in
the
pulpit
diana
considered
how
she
should
humour
the
old
lady
wish
sometimes
he
is
like
a
shepherd
leading
his
flock
to
pasture
she
began
sometimes
he
is
like
a
lifeboat
going
out
to
pick
up
drowning
people
sometimes
it
is
rather
a
surgeon
in
a
hospital
going
round
to
find
out
what
is
the
matter
with
people
and
make
them
well
sometimes
he
is
just
the
messenger
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
all
his
business
is
to
deliver
his
message
and
get
people
to
hear
it
sutphen
looked
at
diana
over
the
table
and
evidently
pricked
up
her
ears
but
diana
spoke
quite
simply
rather
slowly
she
was
thinking
how
basil
had
often
seemed
to
her
in
his
ministry
in
and
out
of
the
pulpit
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
if
your
husband
is
like
that
do
you
know
you
are
married
to
quite
a
remarkable
man
i
thought
as
much
a
great
while
ago
and
what
sort
of
a
pastor
wife
do
you
make
you
are
a
very
handsome
woman
to
be
a
minister
wife
am
i
why
should
not
a
handsome
woman
be
the
wife
of
a
minister
why
she
should
if
she
can
make
up
her
mind
to
it
well
my
dear
if
you
will
have
no
more
breakfast
perhaps
you
will
like
to
go
and
rest
do
you
enjoy
bathing
diana
did
not
take
the
bearing
of
the
question
i
go
into
the
water
every
morning
the
old
lady
explained
you
had
better
do
the
same
it
will
strengthen
you
into
the
water
you
mean
the
salt
water
of
course
i
mean
the
salt
water
there
is
any
fresh
water
to
go
into
and
no
good
if
there
was
i
never
tried
salt
water
i
never
saw
salt
water
before
do
you
good
said
the
old
lady
well
go
and
sleep
my
dear
basil
says
you
want
rest
but
that
way
of
taking
it
was
not
diana
need
or
purpose
she
withdrew
into
her
cool
room
and
as
the
baby
still
slept
set
open
the
blind
doors
which
made
that
pleasant
green
shade
and
sat
down
on
the
threshold
to
be
quiet
and
enjoy
the
view
the
water
was
within
a
few
rods
of
her
window
nothing
but
a
narrow
strip
of
grass
and
a
little
picket
fence
intervening
between
the
house
and
the
sandy
bit
of
beach
the
waves
were
rolling
in
from
the
narrows
which
here
were
but
a
short
distance
to
the
eastward
and
across
the
broad
belt
of
waters
she
could
see
the
low
shore
of
long
island
on
the
other
side
diana
put
her
head
out
of
the
door
and
there
seven
miles
away
to
the
west
and
north
she
could
see
where
a
low
hovering
light
smoke
cloud
told
of
the
big
city
to
which
it
owed
its
origin
over
the
bay
sails
were
flitting
not
swiftly
for
the
air
was
only
very
gently
stirring
but
they
were
many
near
and
far
of
different
sizes
and
forms
and
the
mighty
tide
was
rushing
in
with
wonderful
life
and
energy
in
its
green
waves
diana
senses
were
like
those
of
a
person
enchanted
she
drew
in
the
salt
lively
air
she
looked
at
the
cool
lights
and
shadows
of
the
rushing
water
over
which
here
and
there
still
hung
bands
of
morning
mist
she
heard
the
lap
of
the
waves
upon
the
shore
as
they
went
by
and
it
was
to
her
as
if
she
had
escaped
from
danger
and
perplexity
into
another
world
where
sorrow
might
be
indeed
but
from
which
confusion
and
fear
were
banished
the
baby
slept
on
as
if
she
had
been
broken
off
her
rest
by
the
novelties
and
inconveniences
of
travelling
and
were
making
up
for
lost
time
and
diana
sat
on
the
threshold
of
her
door
and
thought
the
lull
was
inexpressibly
sweet
after
the
storm
that
had
tossed
her
hither
it
gave
her
repose
just
to
remember
that
evan
could
not
find
her
out
and
that
basil
would
leave
her
alone
yes
both
thoughts
came
in
for
a
share
in
the
breaths
of
relief
which
from
time
to
time
wrung
themselves
from
diana
breast
she
knew
it
she
could
not
help
it
and
she
soon
forgot
her
husband
in
thinking
of
her
lover
it
seemed
to
her
she
might
allow
herself
that
indulgence
now
now
when
she
had
put
a
gulf
between
them
which
he
could
not
bridge
over
and
she
would
not
now
when
she
had
brought
a
separation
between
them
which
must
forever
be
final
for
she
would
never
see
him
again
surely
now
she
might
think
of
him
and
let
fancy
taste
the
sweet
bitter
drops
that
memory
would
distil
for
her
diana
went
back
to
the
old
time
and
lived
in
it
for
hours
till
the
baby
awoke
and
claimed
her
and
even
then
she
went
on
with
her
dream
she
dreamed
all
day
next
morning
early
before
she
was
awake
there
came
a
little
imperative
tap
at
her
door
diana
sprang
up
and
opened
it
i
am
going
to
take
my
bath
said
her
hostess
here
a
bathing
dress
put
it
on
and
come
along
now
said
diana
doubtfully
why
of
course
now
now
the
time
nobody
see
you
child
and
if
they
do
it
wo
matter
hundreds
would
see
you
if
you
were
at
long
branch
or
newport
come
along
you
want
bracing
i
wonder
if
i
do
thought
diana
as
she
clothed
herself
in
the
loose
gown
of
brown
mohair
then
slipped
out
after
her
hostess
if
she
did
she
immediately
confessed
to
herself
this
was
the
thing
to
give
it
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
the
morning
air
crisp
and
fresh
and
delicious
the
water
rolling
gently
in
from
the
narrows
again
in
a
mighty
tide
but
with
no
wind
so
sending
up
only
little
waves
to
the
beach
however
they
looked
somewhat
formidable
to
diana
how
far
do
you
go
in
she
asked
as
far
as
i
can
i
ca
swim
child
so
i
keep
to
shore
come
after
me
here
and
she
seized
diana
hand
and
marched
in
ahead
of
her
and
marched
on
till
diana
would
have
stopped
but
the
old
lady
hand
pulled
her
along
it
was
never
to
be
forgotten
that
first
taste
of
salt
water
when
they
were
in
the
flood
up
to
their
necks
her
companion
made
her
duck
her
head
under
it
filled
diana
mouth
and
eyes
at
the
first
gasp
with
salt
water
but
what
a
new
freshness
of
life
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
come
into
her
how
her
brain
cleared
and
her
very
heart
seemed
to
grow
strong
and
her
eyesight
true
in
that
lavatory
she
came
out
of
the
water
for
the
moment
almost
gay
and
made
her
toilette
with
a
vigour
and
energy
she
had
not
brought
to
it
in
many
a
day
breakfast
was
better
to
her
and
the
old
lady
was
contented
with
what
she
said
about
it
yet
diana
sat
and
dreamed
again
all
day
after
that
watching
the
rolling
tide
of
waters
and
letting
her
thoughts
run
on
in
as
uninterrupted
a
flow
she
dreamed
only
about
evan
she
went
over
old
times
and
new
old
impressions
and
new
she
recalled
words
and
looks
and
tones
and
gestures
of
long
ago
and
lately
at
pleasant
valley
she
had
not
dared
here
she
thought
it
was
safe
and
she
might
take
the
indulgence
she
recalled
all
evan
looks
how
he
had
improved
more
stately
more
manly
more
confident
could
that
be
more
graceful
with
the
air
of
command
replacing
a
comparative
repression
of
manner
only
comparative
even
as
the
full
thick
curly
moustache
replaced
a
velvety
dark
line
which
diana
well
remembered
as
he
had
been
then
she
had
fancied
him
perfect
as
he
was
now
he
was
to
the
eye
far
finer
yet
basil
could
not
compare
with
him
ah
why
did
fancy
torture
her
by
ever
bringing
forward
the
comparison
basil
never
pretended
to
wear
a
moustache
and
the
features
of
his
face
were
not
so
regular
and
his
eye
was
not
so
brilliant
and
the
indescribable
air
of
authority
was
not
there
nor
the
regulated
grace
of
movement
true
basil
could
sit
a
horse
and
ride
him
she
knew
as
well
as
anybody
and
true
face
had
a
high
grave
sweetness
which
was
utterly
unknown
to
the
countenance
of
that
other
and
it
was
also
true
that
if
masters
wore
no
air
of
command
he
knew
what
the
thing
meant
especially
command
over
himself
and
there
the
comparison
failed
for
evan
in
the
contrast
diana
down
deep
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
not
satisfied
with
him
not
pleased
not
contented
he
might
know
how
to
give
orders
to
his
company
he
had
not
left
off
himself
being
under
orders
he
might
be
strong
to
enforce
discipline
among
his
men
but
alas
alas
he
had
left
the
reins
loose
upon
the
neck
of
his
passions
basil
never
did
that
never
basil
never
would
in
the
like
circumstances
have
sought
a
weak
gratification
at
her
expense
that
was
the
word
evan
had
been
selfishly
weak
basil
was
always
so
far
as
she
had
known
him
unselfishly
strong
and
yet
and
yet
she
loved
the
weak
one
although
it
pained
her
that
he
should
have
been
weak
days
went
by
diana
lived
in
dreams
what
is
the
matter
with
you
her
old
friend
asked
her
abruptly
one
evening
nothing
i
think
said
diana
looking
up
from
her
sewing
and
answering
in
some
surprise
nothing
the
matter
then
what
did
you
come
here
for
i
thought
diana
hesitated
in
confusion
for
the
moment
my
husband
agreed
with
me
in
thinking
that
it
would
be
good
for
me
to
be
away
from
home
for
awhile
wanted
change
eh
sutphen
said
dryly
diana
did
not
know
what
to
add
to
her
words
change
and
salt
air
the
old
lady
went
on
not
salt
air
particularly
diana
answered
feeling
that
she
must
answer
i
did
not
think
of
salt
air
though
no
change
could
have
been
so
good
for
me
it
been
good
for
you
i
have
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
can
tell
diana
said
looking
up
again
yes
yes
but
that
is
the
thing
i
know
you
enjoy
it
but
do
you
think
it
is
making
you
fat
i
do
need
that
said
diana
smiling
i
am
fat
enough
you
wo
be
if
you
go
on
losing
as
you
have
done
since
you
came
now
i
agree
with
you
that
i
do
think
that
is
clifton
air
what
is
it
diana
could
not
reply
she
was
startled
and
troubled
she
knew
the
fact
was
true
basil
wo
like
it
if
i
let
this
go
on
and
i
do
mean
it
shall
is
anything
the
matter
between
you
and
him
what
do
you
mean
diana
asked
to
gain
time
you
know
what
i
mean
i
spoke
plain
have
you
and
he
had
any
sort
of
a
quarrel
or
disagreement
certainly
not
certainly
then
why
are
you
happy
why
do
you
ask
me
said
diana
why
should
you
question
my
being
happy
i
got
eyes
child
inconvenient
things
for
they
see
you
look
and
act
like
a
marble
woman
only
that
you
are
not
cold
and
that
you
move
about
now
that
is
your
nature
what
spell
has
come
over
you
you
know
sutphen
diana
answered
with
calmness
there
are
many
things
that
come
up
in
the
world
to
try
one
and
trouble
one
things
one
can
not
help
and
that
one
must
bear
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
but
a
woman
with
the
husband
you
have
got
ought
never
to
be
petrified
by
anything
that
comes
to
her
in
the
first
place
she
has
no
cause
and
in
the
second
place
she
has
no
right
there
was
such
an
instant
assent
of
diana
inner
nature
to
at
least
the
latter
of
these
assertions
that
after
a
minute
or
two
pause
she
said
very
simply
thank
you
that
is
true
he
rather
fond
of
you
is
he
the
old
lady
asked
with
a
look
at
her
beautiful
neighbour
yes
too
much
said
diana
sighing
ca
be
too
much
as
i
see
if
only
you
are
equally
fond
of
him
it
is
bad
to
have
inequality
in
that
matter
but
my
dear
whatever
you
do
do
turn
into
marble
there
fire
at
the
heart
of
the
earth
folks
say
but
it
do
do
us
much
good
in
winter
with
this
oracular
statement
sutphen
closed
her
lecture
she
had
said
enough
diana
spent
half
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
in
a
quite
new
set
of
meditations
and
more
days
than
one
she
waked
up
to
see
what
she
had
been
doing
what
business
had
she
to
be
thinking
of
evan
when
she
was
wife
what
right
to
be
even
only
in
imagination
spending
her
life
with
him
she
knew
now
that
she
was
called
to
look
at
it
that
sutphen
had
spoken
true
and
that
a
process
had
been
going
on
in
herself
which
might
well
be
likened
to
the
process
of
petrifying
everything
had
been
losing
taste
and
colour
lately
even
her
baby
was
not
the
delight
she
had
been
formerly
her
mind
had
been
warped
from
its
healthy
condition
and
was
growing
morbid
conscience
roused
up
now
fully
and
bade
diana
stop
short
where
she
was
and
take
another
course
but
there
she
was
met
by
a
difficulty
one
that
many
a
woman
has
had
to
meet
and
that
few
have
ever
overcome
to
take
another
course
meant
that
she
should
cease
thinking
of
evan
cease
thinking
of
him
even
at
all
for
it
was
one
of
those
things
which
you
can
not
do
she
tried
it
and
she
found
it
to
be
impossible
everything
and
anything
would
set
her
upon
the
track
of
thinking
of
him
everything
led
to
him
everything
was
bound
up
with
him
either
by
sympathy
or
contrast
she
found
that
she
must
think
of
evan
because
she
loved
him
she
said
that
to
herself
and
pleaded
it
then
do
not
love
him
was
the
instant
sharp
answer
of
conscience
and
diana
saw
a
battle
set
in
array
that
day
the
day
when
she
got
to
this
point
was
one
of
those
which
even
in
summer
one
may
know
on
the
it
was
grey
and
cool
and
a
violent
easterly
wind
was
driving
the
waters
in
from
the
narrows
the
moment
diana
got
a
sight
of
those
battle
forces
opposed
to
each
other
in
her
spiritual
nature
she
threw
on
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
out
baby
was
sleeping
and
she
left
her
safely
in
charge
of
a
servant
who
asked
no
better
she
went
along
the
shore
in
the
face
of
the
wind
meeting
breasting
overcoming
it
though
with
the
exertion
of
determined
strength
and
energy
the
gale
was
rather
fierce
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
rush
of
that
tide
of
waters
mighty
sweeping
rolling
and
tumbling
in
from
the
great
sea
restless
endless
diana
did
not
stop
to
draw
comparisons
yet
i
think
she
felt
them
even
then
the
wild
accord
of
the
unchained
forces
without
and
the
unchained
forces
within
who
could
stay
them
the
one
or
the
other
that
is
nature
said
diana
to
herself
and
this
is
nature
troubled
sea
that
can
not
rest
but
that
is
spoken
of
the
wicked
am
i
wicked
because
i
can
not
help
what
i
help
as
well
put
out
my
tiny
hand
and
sweep
back
that
stormy
flood
of
water
to
the
ocean
where
it
comes
from
as
hopefully
as
practicably
what
am
i
but
a
chip
or
a
shingle
tossed
and
chased
along
on
the
power
of
the
waves
the
wicked
are
like
the
troubled
sea
when
it
can
not
rest
that
is
it
it
rest
look
at
it
and
think
of
bidding
it
rest
she
had
walked
a
long
way
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
and
yet
unwilling
even
to
turn
her
face
homewards
with
her
mind
still
at
war
she
had
crouched
down
to
rest
under
the
lee
of
an
old
shed
which
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
water
diana
drew
her
shawl
closer
round
her
and
watched
the
wild
play
of
the
waves
which
grew
wilder
every
moment
taking
a
sort
of
gloomy
comfort
in
the
thought
that
they
were
not
more
irresistible
or
unopposable
than
the
tempest
in
her
own
heart
then
came
in
the
thought
it
stole
in
there
was
one
who
could
bid
it
be
still
and
the
sea
heard
him
and
was
quiet
if
he
could
do
that
could
he
not
still
this
other
storm
a
worse
storm
yes
but
could
not
the
hand
that
did
one
thing
do
the
other
diana
knew
on
the
instant
that
it
could
but
with
that
came
another
consciousness
that
she
wished
it
could
not
she
did
not
want
the
storm
laid
better
the
raging
forces
than
the
calm
that
would
follow
the
death
of
her
love
for
evan
knowlton
but
it
could
never
die
was
the
impatient
objection
of
her
heart
and
then
came
the
whisper
of
conscience
it
ought
you
know
it
ought
and
the
lord
never
bade
you
do
a
thing
he
would
not
help
you
to
do
or
do
for
you
if
you
are
willing
and
she
remembered
if
ye
shall
say
to
this
mountain
be
thou
removed
could
she
be
willing
that
was
all
would
she
say
it
the
lord
said
there
are
some
sorts
of
devils
that
are
only
cast
out
by
prayer
and
fasting
and
i
suppose
that
means
by
very
great
and
determinate
laying
hold
of
the
offered
strength
and
fullest
surrender
to
all
its
dispositions
this
was
a
battle
before
which
waterloo
sinks
to
a
play
of
and
gravelotte
to
a
great
wrestling
match
there
was
struggle
on
those
fields
and
bitter
determination
and
death
faced
and
death
met
and
yet
the
combatants
there
never
went
to
the
front
with
the
agony
which
diana
fight
cost
her
and
if
anybody
thinks
i
am
extravagant
i
will
remind
him
on
what
authority
we
have
it
that
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
is
greater
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
let
no
one
suppose
the
battle
in
diana
instance
was
soon
fought
and
over
it
was
death
to
give
up
evan
not
the
death
of
the
body
which
lived
on
and
was
strong
though
she
grew
visibly
thin
but
the
death
of
the
will
and
that
is
a
death
harder
by
far
than
the
other
diana
was
in
the
struggle
of
that
fight
for
many
a
day
and
as
i
said
growing
thin
under
it
she
was
not
willing
if
she
could
be
delivered
from
this
passion
which
was
like
her
life
she
was
not
willing
to
be
delivered
yet
duty
was
plain
conscience
was
inexorable
diana
struggled
and
fought
till
she
could
fight
no
longer
and
then
she
dragged
herself
as
it
were
to
the
feet
of
the
stiller
of
the
waves
with
the
cry
of
the
woman
on
her
lips
and
in
her
heart
lord
help
me
but
the
help
diana
knew
by
this
time
meant
that
he
should
do
all
the
work
himself
not
come
in
aid
of
her
efforts
which
were
like
ropes
of
straw
in
a
flame
let
no
one
think
either
that
the
first
struggle
to
have
faith
was
faith
itself
or
that
the
first
endeavour
to
submit
was
surrender
there
is
a
wide
difference
and
often
a
wide
distance
but
there
came
a
time
it
was
slow
in
coming
but
it
came
when
like
a
wearied
child
diana
ceased
from
her
own
efforts
and
like
a
helpless
child
threw
herself
upon
strength
that
she
knew
and
then
the
work
was
done
let
no
one
say
either
that
what
i
have
described
is
an
impossibility
if
ye
have
faith
the
master
said
nothing
shall
be
impossible
to
you
and
nothing
is
he
is
a
rock
his
work
is
perfect
and
he
who
overcame
all
our
enemies
for
us
can
overcome
them
in
us
they
are
conquered
foes
only
the
lord
will
not
do
the
work
for
those
who
are
trusting
in
themselves
chapter
xxxiii
buds
and
blossoms
it
was
the
end
of
september
nearing
a
time
of
storms
again
in
the
air
and
on
the
sea
but
an
absolute
calm
had
settled
down
upon
diana
not
at
all
the
calm
of
death
for
after
death
in
this
warfare
comes
not
only
victory
but
new
life
it
was
very
strange
even
to
herself
she
had
ceased
to
think
of
captain
knowlton
if
she
thought
of
him
it
was
with
the
recognition
that
his
power
over
her
was
gone
she
felt
like
a
person
delivered
from
helpless
bondage
there
was
some
lameness
there
were
some
bruises
yet
from
the
fight
gone
by
but
diana
was
every
day
recovering
from
these
and
elasticity
and
warmth
were
coming
back
to
the
members
that
had
been
but
lately
rigid
and
cold
the
sun
shone
again
for
her
and
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
arch
of
it
grew
every
day
loftier
and
brighter
to
her
sense
at
first
coming
to
clifton
diana
had
perceived
the
beauties
and
novelties
of
her
new
surroundings
now
she
began
to
enjoy
them
the
salt
air
was
delicious
the
light
morning
mist
over
the
bay
as
she
saw
it
when
she
went
to
take
her
morning
bath
held
a
whole
day
of
sunlit
promise
within
its
mysterious
folds
the
soft
low
hum
of
the
distant
city
which
she
could
hear
when
the
waves
were
still
made
the
solitude
and
the
freshness
and
the
purity
of
the
island
seem
doubly
rare
and
sweet
and
her
baby
began
to
be
now
to
diana
the
most
wonderful
of
delights
more
than
ever
it
had
been
at
any
previous
time
all
this
while
she
had
had
letters
from
basil
not
very
long
letters
such
as
a
man
can
write
to
a
woman
whose
whole
sympathy
he
knows
he
has
but
good
letters
such
as
a
man
can
write
to
a
woman
to
whom
his
own
heart
and
soul
have
given
all
they
have
not
that
he
ever
spoke
of
that
fact
or
alluded
to
it
basil
was
no
maudlin
and
no
fool
to
ask
for
a
gift
which
can
not
be
yielded
by
an
effort
of
will
and
besides
he
had
never
entirely
lost
hope
so
that
though
things
were
dark
enough
for
him
certainly
he
could
write
manly
strong
sensible
letters
which
in
their
very
lack
of
all
allusion
to
his
own
feelings
spoke
whole
volumes
to
the
woman
who
knew
him
and
could
interpret
them
the
thought
of
him
grieved
her
it
was
getting
to
be
now
the
only
grief
she
had
her
own
letters
to
him
were
brief
and
rare
diana
had
a
nervous
fear
of
letting
the
clifton
postmark
be
seen
on
a
letter
of
hers
at
home
knowing
what
sort
of
play
sometimes
went
on
in
the
pleasant
valley
post
office
so
she
never
sent
a
letter
except
when
she
had
a
chance
to
despatch
it
from
new
york
these
epistles
were
very
abstract
they
spoke
of
the
baby
told
of
sutphen
gave
details
of
things
seen
and
experienced
but
of
diana
inner
life
the
fight
and
the
victory
not
a
whit
she
could
not
write
about
them
to
basil
for
glad
as
he
would
be
of
what
she
could
tell
him
she
could
not
say
enough
in
getting
deliverance
from
a
love
it
was
wrong
to
indulge
in
becoming
able
to
forget
evan
she
had
not
thereby
come
nearer
to
her
husband
or
in
the
least
fonder
of
thinking
of
him
and
so
diana
shrank
from
the
whole
subject
when
she
found
herself
with
pen
in
hand
and
paper
before
her
when
september
was
gone
and
october
had
begun
its
course
a
letter
came
from
basil
in
which
he
desired
to
know
about
diana
plans
there
were
no
hindrances
any
longer
in
the
way
of
her
coming
home
he
told
her
diana
had
known
that
such
a
notification
would
come
must
come
and
yet
it
gave
her
an
unwelcome
start
sutphen
had
handed
it
to
her
as
they
came
in
from
their
morning
dip
in
the
salt
water
the
coachman
had
brought
it
late
last
evening
from
the
post
office
she
said
diana
had
dressed
before
reading
it
and
when
she
had
read
it
she
sat
down
upon
the
threshold
of
her
glass
door
to
think
and
examine
herself
it
was
october
yet
still
and
mild
as
june
haze
lay
lingering
about
the
horizon
softened
the
shore
of
long
island
hid
with
a
thick
curtain
the
place
of
the
busy
city
the
roar
of
which
diana
could
plainly
enough
hear
in
the
stillness
a
strange
indistinct
mysterious
significant
murmur
of
distant
unrest
all
before
and
around
her
was
rest
the
flowing
waters
were
too
quiet
to
suggest
anything
disquieting
only
life
without
which
rest
is
nought
the
air
was
inexpressibly
sweet
and
fresh
the
young
light
of
the
day
dancing
as
it
were
upon
every
cloud
edge
and
sail
edge
in
jocund
triumph
beginning
the
work
which
the
day
would
see
done
diana
sat
down
and
looked
out
into
it
all
and
tried
to
hold
communion
with
herself
she
was
sorry
to
leave
this
place
yes
why
not
she
was
sorry
to
exchange
her
present
life
for
the
old
one
quiet
and
solitary
it
had
been
this
life
at
clifton
for
sutphen
scarcely
made
her
feel
less
alone
with
her
than
without
her
and
she
had
held
herself
back
from
society
quiet
and
solitary
and
lately
healing
and
pleasant
valley
was
full
of
painful
memories
and
associations
her
mother
and
her
husband
diana
felt
as
if
she
could
have
welcomed
everything
else
if
only
basil
had
not
been
there
the
sight
of
the
lovely
bay
with
its
misty
shores
and
its
springing
light
hurt
her
at
last
because
she
must
leave
it
she
sank
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
call
herself
to
account
duty
was
waiting
before
her
was
she
not
willing
to
take
it
up
she
had
surrendered
her
will
utterly
to
god
in
the
matter
of
her
love
to
evan
and
she
had
been
delivered
from
the
torture
and
the
bondage
of
it
quite
delivered
she
could
bear
to
live
without
evan
now
she
could
bear
to
live
without
thinking
of
him
he
would
always
be
in
a
certain
sense
dear
but
the
spell
of
passion
was
broken
for
ever
that
did
not
make
her
love
her
husband
no
but
would
not
the
same
strength
that
had
freed
her
from
temptation
on
the
one
hand
help
her
to
go
forward
and
do
her
duty
on
the
other
and
in
love
and
gratitude
for
the
deliverance
vouchsafed
her
should
she
not
do
it
i
will
do
it
if
i
die
was
her
inward
conclusion
and
i
shall
not
die
but
by
the
lord
help
i
shall
do
it
so
she
wrote
to
her
husband
that
she
was
ready
and
he
came
to
fetch
her
the
pleasant
valley
maples
were
flaunting
in
orange
and
crimson
when
the
home
journey
was
made
the
fairest
month
of
the
year
was
in
the
prime
of
its
beauty
the
air
had
that
wonderful
clearness
and
calm
which
bids
the
spirit
of
the
beholder
be
still
and
be
glad
saying
that
there
is
peace
and
victory
somewhere
and
rest
when
the
harvest
of
life
is
gathered
diana
felt
the
speech
but
thought
nevertheless
that
for
peace
and
victory
were
a
good
way
off
she
believed
they
would
come
when
life
was
done
the
present
thing
was
to
live
and
carry
the
burden
and
do
the
work
the
great
elms
hung
still
green
and
sheltering
over
the
door
the
house
was
enlarged
and
improved
and
greatly
beautified
with
a
coat
of
paint
diana
saw
it
all
and
she
saw
the
marvellous
beauty
of
the
meadows
and
their
bordering
hills
she
felt
as
if
she
were
coming
to
her
prison
and
place
of
hard
labour
how
do
you
like
the
looks
of
things
her
husband
asked
nice
as
can
be
you
like
it
very
much
i
am
glad
you
did
not
make
the
house
white
i
remembered
you
said
it
ought
to
be
brown
but
would
you
have
liked
it
white
i
would
have
liked
it
no
way
but
your
way
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
and
look
at
her
which
diana
could
not
answer
and
which
cut
her
sharply
she
had
noticed
she
thought
that
basil
was
more
sober
than
he
used
to
be
she
thought
she
knew
why
and
she
wanted
to
tell
him
part
of
what
had
gone
on
in
her
mind
of
late
and
how
free
she
was
of
the
feelings
he
supposed
were
troubling
her
but
a
great
shyness
of
the
subject
had
seized
diana
she
was
afraid
to
broach
it
at
all
lest
going
on
from
one
thing
to
another
basil
might
ask
a
question
she
could
not
answer
she
was
very
sorry
for
him
so
much
that
she
almost
forgot
to
be
sorry
for
herself
as
she
went
into
the
house
flandin

the
salt

might
wonder
diana

cheerfully

place

said
and
with
a
smile
well

did
salt
water
do
ye
the
minister
said
you
was
gone
to
salt
water
somewheres
it
did
me
more
good
than
i
could
ever
make
you
understand
i
do
believe
it
said
starling
harshly
you
mean
it
was
a
clever
thing
to
play
lady
and
sit
with
your
hands
before
you
all
summer
it
was
good
there
was
somebody
at
home
to
do
the
work
not
your
work
di
said
her
husband
good
humouredly
nor
my
work
did
that
come
along
and
see
what
i
have
done
he
drew
her
off
into
the
little
front
hall
or
entry
from
there
through
a
side
door
into
the
new
part
of
the
building
there
was
a
roomy
cool
bright
room
lined
with
the
minister
books
curtained
and
furnished
not
expensively
indeed
yet
with
a
thorough
air
of
comfort
taking
the
baby
from
her
arms
basil
led
the
way
from
this
room
up
a
short
stairway
to
chambers
above
which
were
charmingly
neat
light
and
cheerful
all
in
order
everything
was
done
everything
was
there
that
ought
to
be
there
he
laid
the
sleeping
child
down
in
its
crib
and
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
serious
face
how
will
you
stand
it
diana
basil
i
was
just
thinking
how
will
you
we
can
do
what
ought
to
be
done
said
he
looking
into
her
face
i
know
you
can
i
think
i
can
too
in
this
and
i
think
it
is
right
to
take
care
of
mother
i
am
sure
it
is
diana
by
the
lord
help
we
can
do
right
in
everything
yes
basil
i
know
it
she
said
meeting
his
eyes
with
a
steady
look
he
turned
away
very
grave
but
with
a
deep
ejaculation
of
thankfulness
diana
eyes
filled
but
she
too
turned
away
she
could
add
no
more
it
was
not
words
but
living
that
must
speak
for
her
now
and
it
did
even
that
same
evening
flandin
would
not
go
away
it
was
too
good
an
opportunity
of
gathering
information
about
various
points
on
which
the
town
had
been
curious
and
divided
she
kept
her
place
till
after
supper
but
all
she
could
see
was
a
fair
quiet
demeanour
an
unruffled
beautiful
face
and
an
unconscious
dignity
of
carriage
which
was
somewhat
provokingly
imposing
she
saw
that
diana
was
at
home
and
likely
to
be
mistress
in
her
own
sphere
held
in
too
much
honour
by
her
husband
and
holding
him
in
too
much
honour
for
that
a
pin
point
of
malicious
curiosity
might
find
an
entering
place
between
them
she
reported
afterwards
that
the
minister
was
a
fool
and
his
wife
another
and
so
they
fitted
starling
was
inclined
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
the
two
most
nearly
concerned
knew
better
they
did
not
though
they
were
the
only
ones
of
all
the
world
that
knew
it
while
diana
had
been
away
at
clifton
the
minister
had
managed
to
make
one
of
the
company
at
elmfield
rather
often
moved
by
various
reasons
one
effect
however
of
this
plan
of
action
had
been
unfavourable
to
his
own
peace
of
mind
he
saw
evan
and
came
to
know
him
he
know
him
though
the
young
man
would
much
rather
have
kept
aloof
from
contact
with
diana
husband
basil
simplicity
of
manner
and
straightforwardness
were
too
much
for
him
and
while
an
unwilling
and
enormous
respect
for
the
minister
grew
up
in
captain
knowlton
mind
the
minister
on
his
part
saw
and
felt
and
perhaps
exaggerated
the
attractiveness
of
the
young
army
officer
basil
was
not
at
all
given
to
in
fact
he
did
not
think
of
himself
enough
for
such
a
mischievous
mental
transaction
however
he
perceived
the
grace
of
figure
and
bearing
the
air
of
command
and
the
beauty
of
feature
which
he
thought
might
well
take
a
woman
eye
my
poor
diana
he
said
to
himself
her
fancy
has
caught
the
stamp
of
all
this
and
will
hold
it
naturally
she
is
not
a
woman
to
like
and
unlike
what
chance
for
me
which
meditations
unwholesome
as
they
were
did
not
prevent
attaching
himself
to
captain
knowlton
society
and
making
a
friend
of
him
in
spite
of
both
their
selves
as
it
were
the
captain
mental
nature
he
suspected
and
found
was
by
no
means
in
order
to
correspond
with
his
physical
and
if
a
friend
could
help
him
he
would
be
that
friend
and
basil
did
not
see
that
the
young
officer
evident
respect
for
himself
and
succumbing
to
his
friendly
advances
were
a
very
significant
tribute
to
his
own
personal
and
other
qualities
it
was
a
little
matter
to
him
indeed
such
tribute
if
he
could
not
have
it
from
his
wife
he
had
everything
else
in
her
that
a
man
heart
could
desire
he
saw
that
soon
after
her
return
from
clifton
diana
demeanour
had
been
gracious
and
sweet
before
always
although
with
a
shadow
upon
it
now
the
shadow
was
gone
or
changed
he
could
not
tell
which
she
was
not
as
he
had
once
known
her
but
she
went
about
her
house
with
a
gentle
grace
which
never
failed
starling
was
at
times
exceedingly
trying
and
irritating
diana
met
and
received
it
all
as
blandly
as
she
would
give
her
face
to
the
west
wind
at
the
same
time
no
rough
wind
could
move
her
from
the
way
of
her
duty
starling
was
able
neither
to
provoke
her
nor
prevail
with
her
she
was
the
sweetest
of
ruling
spirits
within
her
house
without
it
she
was
the
most
indefatigable
and
tender
of
to
her
husband
tender
not
to
him
that
is
but
to
all
those
for
whom
he
and
she
ministered
a
nurse
to
the
sick
a
provider
to
the
very
poor
a
counsellor
to
the
vexed
for
such
would
come
to
her
especially
among
the
younger
women
a
comforter
to
those
in
trouble
such
a
comforter
lips
of
healing
her
husband
said
of
her
once
wise
rare
sweet
as
honey
but
with
the
savour
of
the
wind
blowing
over
wild
thyme
if
a
little
of
that
sweetness
could
have
come
to
him
but
while
her
life
was
full
of
observance
for
him
gentle
and
submissive
as
a
child
to
every
expressed
wish
of
his
and
watchful
to
meet
his
unexpressed
wish
it
was
the
grief
of
diana
life
that
she
did
not
love
this
man
in
the
reserve
of
her
new
england
nature
i
think
what
she
felt
for
him
was
hidden
even
from
herself
that
is
i
mean
as
days
and
months
went
on
at
diana
first
coming
home
from
clifton
no
doubt
her
opinion
of
her
own
feelings
and
basil
opinion
of
them
was
correct
if
a
change
came
it
came
so
imperceptibly
that
nobody
knew
it
diana
beauty
at
this
time
had
taken
a
new
phasis
it
had
lost
the
marble
rigidity
and
calm
impassiveness
which
had
characterized
it
during
all
the
time
of
her
married
life
hitherto
and
it
had
not
regained
the
careless
lightness
of
the
days
before
she
knew
evan
it
was
something
lovelier
than
either
so
lovely
that
basil
wondered
and
starling
sometimes
stared
and
every
lip
in
town
came
to
have
nothing
but
utterances
of
respect
more
often
utterances
of
devotion
for
the
minister
wife
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
give
you
a
just
impression
of
it
for
diana
face
had
come
curiously
near
the
expression
on
the
face
of
her
own
little
child
innocent
tender
pure
something
like
that
grave
but
with
no
clouds
at
all
strong
and
purposeful
yet
with
an
utter
absence
of
or
it
had
always
been
to
a
certain
degree
innocent
and
pure
but
that
was
negative
and
this
was
positive
the
refined
gold
that
had
been
through
the
fire
and
no
baby
face
is
sweeter
than
diana
was
now
all
blossoming
as
it
were
with
love
and
humility
if
her
husband
had
loved
her
before
the
feeling
of
longing
and
despair
that
came
over
him
when
he
looked
at
this
rarefied
beauty
would
be
hard
to
tell
he
had
ruined
her
life
he
reproached
himself
and
she
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
yet
as
i
said
though
diana
face
was
grave
it
was
a
gravity
wholly
without
clouds
the
gravity
of
the
summer
dawn
when
the
stars
are
shining
and
the
light
in
the
east
tells
of
the
coming
day
but
mental
changes
work
slowly
and
insensibly
ofttimes
and
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
went
by
each
with
its
fulness
of
business
and
cares
and
no
one
in
the
little
family
knew
exactly
what
forces
were
silently
busy
so
a
year
rolled
round
and
another
year
began
its
course
and
ran
it
and
june
came
for
the
second
time
since
diana
had
returned
from
the
seaside
elmfield
in
all
this
time
had
not
been
revisited
by
its
owners
june
had
come
again
windows
were
open
and
the
breath
of
roses
filled
the
minister
study
for
diana
had
developed
lately
a
passion
for
flowers
and
for
gardening
and
her
husband
had
given
her
with
full
hands
all
she
wanted
and
much
more
starling
had
grumbled
and
been
very
sarcastic
about
it
however
basil
had
ordered
in
plants
and
seeds
and
tools
and
books
of
instruction
he
had
become
instructor
himself
and
the
result
was
the
parsonage
as
people
began
to
call
it
was
encompassed
with
a
little
wilderness
of
floral
beauty
which
was
growing
to
be
the
wonder
of
pleasant
valley
it
will
do
them
good
the
minister
said
when
diana
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
country
farmers
passing
by
were
falling
into
the
habit
of
reining
in
their
horses
and
stopping
for
a
good
long
look
for
instead
of
the
patch
of
marigolds
and
hollyhocks
in
front
of
the
house
all
the
wing
inhabited
by
the
minister
and
his
family
was
surrounded
with
flowers
roses
bloomed
in
the
beds
and
out
of
the
grass
and
climbed
up
on
the
walls
of
the
house
white
annunciation
lilies
shone
like
stars
here
and
there
whole
beds
of
heliotrope
were
preparing
their
perfume
geraniums
held
up
their
elegant
heads
of
every
colour
verbenas
and
mignonette
and
honeysuckle
and
red
lilies
and
yellow
lilies
and
hardy
gladiolus
were
either
just
beginning
or
in
full
beauty
with
many
more
too
many
to
tell
and
the
guelder
rose
had
shaken
out
its
white
balls
of
snow
and
one
or
two
laburnums
were
hung
thick
with
their
clusters
of
dropping
gold
the
garden
was
growing
large
and
as
i
said
become
a
wilderness
of
beauty
nevertheless
the
roses
kept
their
own
and
this
afternoon
the
breath
of
them
rising
above
all
the
other
sweet
breaths
that
were
abroad
came
in
and
filled
the
study
diana
was
there
alone
sitting
by
one
of
the
open
windows
busy
with
some
work
not
so
busy
but
that
she
smelt
the
roses
and
felt
the
glory
of
light
and
colour
that
was
outside
and
heard
the
hum
of
bees
and
the
twitter
of
birds
and
the
soft
indistinguishable
chirrup
of
insects
which
filled
the
air
diana
sewed
on
till
another
slight
sound
mingled
with
those
the
tread
of
a
foot
on
the
gravel
walk
down
below
then
she
lifted
her
head
suddenly
and
with
that
her
hands
and
her
work
fell
into
her
lap
it
was
long
past
and
the
lovely
slant
light
striking
over
the
roses
and
coming
through
the
crown
of
a
young
elm
fell
upon
basil
who
was
slowly
sauntering
along
the
garden
walk
with
his
little
girl
in
his
arms
very
slowly
and
often
standing
still
to
exchange
love
passages
and
indulge
mutual
admiration
with
her
they
were
partly
talking
of
the
flowers
diana
could
see
but
her
own
eyes
had
no
vision
but
for
those
two
the
baby
and
the
father
one
little
fair
fat
arm
was
round
basil
neck
the
other
tiny
hand
was
sometimes
stretched
out
towards
the
lilies
or
the
laburnums
in
critical
or
delighted
the
word
accompaniment
to
which
diana
could
not
hear
but
could
well
guess
at
other
times
it
was
brought
round
ecstatically
to
join
its
companion
round
her
neck
or
lifted
to
his
face
with
fingers
of
caressing
or
thrust
in
among
the
locks
of
his
hair
which
last
seemed
to
be
a
favourite
pleasure
basil
would
stand
still
at
such
times
and
talk
to
her
or
wait
diana
knew
with
just
what
a
smile
in
his
eyes
to
take
the
soft
touches
and
return
them
diana
work
was
forgotten
and
her
eyes
were
riveted
why
did
the
scene
in
the
garden
give
her
such
pain
she
would
have
said
if
she
had
been
asked
that
it
was
and
sorrow
for
the
inevitable
how
came
it
that
she
held
not
as
near
a
place
to
basil
as
her
child
did
she
ought
but
it
was
not
so
she
thought
she
wished
she
loved
him
she
ought
to
be
as
free
to
put
her
hand
on
the
soft
curls
of
basil
hair
as
her
baby
was
but
they
stood
too
far
apart
from
each
other
and
she
would
as
soon
have
dared
anything
and
basil
never
looked
at
so
he
had
found
out
how
she
felt
and
knew
she
did
not
care
for
his
looks
and
kind
and
gentle
and
unselfish
as
he
was
yes
and
strong
in
and
self
renunciation
he
had
resigned
his
and
left
her
to
her
yet
diana
knew
with
every
smile
and
kiss
to
the
little
one
what
a
cry
of
basil
heart
went
out
towards
the
child
mother
only
he
would
never
give
that
cry
utterance
again
what
can
i
do
thought
diana
i
can
not
bear
it
and
he
thinks
i
am
a
great
deal
more
unhappy
than
i
am
unhappy
i
am
not
unhappy
if
only
were
not
unhappy
she
could
not
explain
her
feelings
to
herself
she
had
no
notion
that
she
was
jealous
of
her
own
child
but
the
pain
bit
her
and
she
could
not
endure
to
sit
up
there
at
the
window
and
look
on
rising
hastily
she
dropped
her
work
out
of
her
hand
and
was
about
to
go
down
into
the
garden
to
join
them
when
another
glance
showed
her
that
basil
had
turned
and
was
coming
back
into
the
house
diana
listened
to
them
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
basil
feet
and
the
baby
voice
sounding
together
with
a
curious
unrest
at
her
heart
and
her
eyes
met
the
pair
eagerly
as
they
entered
the
room
from
what
impulse
she
could
not
have
told
she
advanced
to
meet
them
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
take
the
child
which
however
with
a
little
confident
cry
of
delight
turned
from
her
and
clasped
both
little
arms
again
round
her
neck
basil
smiled
diana
tried
to
follow
suit
she
would
rather
be
with
you
than
with
me
she
remarked
however
i
wonder
at
her
bad
taste
said
basil
but
he
turned
his
face
to
the
baby
and
laid
it
gently
against
her
soft
cheek
it
is
because
you
are
stronger
diana
went
in
is
it
that
is
one
thing
you
may
notice
children
always
like
strong
arms
her
mother
arms
are
not
weak
no
but
i
am
not
so
strong
as
you
basil
bodily
or
mentally
and
i
think
that
is
more
yet
mental
strength
i
mean
children
recognise
that
and
love
to
rest
on
it
you
do
not
think
such
discrimination
is
confined
to
children
said
basil
with
a
dry
quiet
humourousness
at
which
diana
could
not
help
smiling
though
she
felt
quite
as
much
like
a
very
different
demonstration
she
watched
the
two
as
basil
walked
on
to
his
and
sat
down
with
the
child
on
his
knee
she
saw
the
upturned
eye
of
love
with
which
the
little
one
regarded
him
as
he
did
this
and
then
how
with
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
smoothed
down
her
frock
and
laid
the
little
hands
contentedly
together
in
her
lap
basil
drew
his
portfolio
towards
him
and
began
to
write
a
letter
diana
went
to
her
work
again
in
the
window
feeling
restless
she
felt
she
must
say
something
more
and
in
a
different
key
and
as
she
worked
she
watched
the
two
at
the
table
this
was
not
the
way
things
ought
to
be
her
husband
must
be
told
at
least
something
of
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
he
ought
to
know
that
she
was
no
longer
miserable
he
would
be
glad
to
know
that
diana
thought
he
might
have
seen
it
without
her
telling
but
if
he
did
not
then
she
must
speak
he
had
a
right
to
so
much
comfort
as
she
could
give
him
and
he
ought
to
be
told
that
she
was
not
now
wishing
to
be
in
another
presence
and
society
than
his
if
she
could
tell
him
without
his
thinking
too
much
she
watched
till
the
letter
was
written
and
he
was
folding
it
up
and
then
diana
tongue
hesitated
unaccountably
basil
she
began
obliging
herself
to
speak
i
can
smell
the
roses
again
he
looked
up
instantly
with
keen
eyes
you
know
there
was
a
long
while
a
long
while
in
which
i
could
not
feel
that
anything
was
sweet
and
now
now
i
can
i
knew
you
ought
to
know
you
would
be
glad
i
am
like
a
person
who
has
been
in
a
brain
fever
or
dead
and
awaked
to
life
and
soundness
again
you
can
not
think
what
it
is
to
me
to
see
the
sky
diana
eyes
filled
what
did
you
use
to
see
the
vault
of
my
prison
what
signified
whether
it
were
blue
or
brazen
but
now
well
now
diana
i
can
see
through
perhaps
this
was
not
very
intelligible
for
manifestly
it
was
not
easy
for
diana
to
explain
herself
but
basil
this
time
did
not
speak
and
she
presently
began
again
i
mean
there
is
no
prison
vault
nor
any
prison
any
more
the
walls
that
seemed
to
shut
me
in
are
dissolved
and
i
am
free
again
and
you
can
see
through
basil
repeated
yes
where
my
eyes
were
met
by
something
harder
than
fate
it
is
all
broken
up
and
light
and
clear
and
i
can
see
through
i
never
used
to
think
you
were
a
fanciful
woman
said
the
minister
eyeing
her
intently
but
this
time
i
do
not
quite
follow
you
di
i
am
afraid
to
take
your
words
for
all
they
may
mean
but
you
may
what
may
i
they
mean
all
i
say
i
am
sure
of
that
said
he
smiling
though
he
looked
anxious
but
you
see
there
is
the
very
point
of
my
difficulty
i
mean
basil
that
i
am
out
of
my
bondage
which
i
thought
never
could
be
broken
in
this
world
out
of
what
bondage
my
love
diana
paused
when
i
went
down
to
clifton
to
sutphen
do
you
know
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
evan
knowlton
diana
colour
stirred
but
she
looked
her
husband
steadily
in
the
face
i
suspected
it
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
basil
night
and
day
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
was
that
bondage
depends
on
how
you
take
it
said
the
minister
but
it
was
basil
i
found
excuses
for
you
diana
did
you
she
said
humbly
i
daresay
you
did
it
is
like
you
but
it
was
wrong
and
i
knew
it
was
wrong
and
i
could
not
help
it
is
not
that
bondage
of
the
worst
sort
o
you
do
know
basil
never
knew
such
a
fight
between
wrong
and
right
between
your
wish
and
your
will
but
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
see
that
it
was
wrong
i
thought
it
was
of
necessity
how
came
your
view
to
change
i
do
know
all
of
a
sudden
something
sutphen
said
one
morning
started
my
thoughts
and
i
saw
at
once
that
i
was
doing
very
wrong
still
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
help
it
how
did
you
help
it
did
basil
i
fought
and
fought
o
what
a
fight
it
seemed
like
death
and
worse
to
give
up
evan
and
to
stop
thinking
of
him
meant
to
give
him
up
i
could
not
gain
the
victory
but
do
you
remember
telling
me
often
that
christ
would
do
everything
for
me
if
i
would
trust
him
yes
basil
he
did
it
was
i
at
last
i
got
utterly
desperate
and
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
and
claimed
the
promise
i
was
as
helpless
as
i
could
be
and
then
basil
presently
i
can
not
tell
how
the
work
was
done
the
battle
was
fought
and
the
victory
was
won
and
i
was
free
and
ever
since
i
have
been
singing
songs
in
my
heart
basil
did
not
flush
with
pleasure
diana
thought
he
grew
pale
rather
but
he
bowed
his
head
upon
the
head
of
the
little
one
on
his
lap
with
a
deep
low
utterance
of
thanksgiving
she
thought
he
would
have
shown
his
pleasure
differently
she
did
not
know
how
to
go
on
it
was
not
i
basil
she
said
after
a
pause
it
never
is
i
or
you
answered
the
minister
without
looking
up
it
is
always
christ
if
anything
is
done
since
then
you
see
i
have
felt
like
a
freedwoman
which
you
are
and
then
you
can
not
think
what
it
was
to
me
and
what
it
is
to
smell
the
roses
again
there
were
not
many
roses
about
clifton
at
that
time
in
september
but
it
was
the
bay
and
the
shores
and
the
vessels
and
the
sky
i
seemed
to
have
got
new
eyes
and
everything
was
so
beautiful
basil
repeated
his
ejaculation
of
thanksgiving
but
he
said
nothing
more
and
diana
felt
somehow
disappointed
did
he
not
understand
that
she
was
free
he
bowed
his
head
close
down
upon
the
head
of
his
little
daughter
and
was
silent
i
knew
you
ought
to
know
diana
repeated
thank
you
he
said
and
yet
i
could
tell
you
though
i
knew
you
would
be
so
glad
for
me
and
with
me
i
am
unutterably
glad
for
you
and
not
with
me
she
said
to
herself
why
not
is
it
enough
if
i
do
love
anybody
else
if
i
give
him
all
i
have
to
give
even
though
that
be
not
what
he
gives
to
me
i
wish
basil
would
be
reasonable
it
was
certainly
the
first
time
it
had
ever
occurred
to
her
to
make
him
the
subject
of
such
a
wish
but
diana
did
not
speak
out
her
thought
and
of
course
her
husband
did
not
answer
it
chapter
xxxiv
dairy
and
parish
work
according
to
her
custom
diana
was
up
early
the
next
morning
and
down
in
her
dairy
while
yet
the
sun
was
only
just
getting
above
the
horizon
the
dairy
window
stood
open
night
and
day
and
the
cool
dewy
freshness
which
was
upon
the
roses
and
lilies
outside
was
in
there
too
among
the
pans
of
cream
the
fragrance
of
those
mingled
with
the
different
but
very
pure
sweetness
of
these
diana
was
skimming
pan
after
pan
the
thick
yellow
cream
wrinkled
up
in
rich
folds
under
her
skimmer
the
was
just
before
the
window
and
outside
of
the
window
were
the
roses
and
honeysuckles
diana
sleeves
were
rolled
up
above
her
elbows
her
hands
were
disposing
of
their
business
with
quick
skill
yet
now
and
then
even
with
a
pan
under
her
hand
she
paused
leaned
on
the
window
sill
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
she
felt
glad
about
something
and
yet
an
unsatisfied
query
was
in
her
heart
she
was
glad
that
she
had
at
last
told
her
husband
how
the
spell
was
broken
that
had
bound
her
to
evan
and
kept
her
apart
from
himself
but
he
did
not
seem
so
glad
as
i
expected
then
she
recalled
the
deep
tone
of
his
thanksgiving
for
her
and
diana
eyes
took
a
yearning
look
which
certainly
saw
no
roses
it
was
all
for
me
it
was
not
for
his
own
share
he
did
not
think
he
had
any
share
in
it
he
has
a
notion
that
i
hate
him
and
i
do
not
i
never
did
it
occurred
to
her
here
dimly
that
she
had
once
felt
a
horror
of
him
and
who
would
not
rather
have
hatred
than
horror
she
went
on
skimming
her
cream
what
should
she
do
i
can
not
speak
about
it
again
she
said
to
herself
i
can
not
say
any
more
to
him
i
can
not
say
i
do
know
what
i
ought
to
say
but
i
wish
he
knew
that
i
do
not
dislike
him
he
is
keen
enough
surely
he
will
find
it
out
pan
after
pan
was
set
aside
the
churn
was
filled
and
diana
began
to
churn
presently
in
came
starling
hai
josh
brought
the
milk
yet
not
yet
it
time
he
did
that
fellow
got
a
lazy
streak
in
him
somewhere
it
only
just
five
mother
the
butter
ought
to
be
come
by
now
i
should
mrs
starling
was
passing
in
and
out
setting
the
table
in
the
kitchen
she
would
have
no
help
in
her
dominions
so
it
was
only
in
diana
part
of
the
house
that
the
little
servant
officiated
whom
basil
insisted
upon
keeping
for
his
wife
ease
and
comfort
and
leisure
diana
herself
attended
as
of
old
to
her
particular
sphere
the
dairy
how
do
you
know
it
just
five
her
mother
went
on
presently
i
looked
watches
exclaimed
starling
with
much
disgust
your
husband
is
ridiculous
about
you
but
diana
could
bear
that
in
your
dairy
is
a
queer
place
to
wear
a
watch
why
mother
it
for
use
not
for
show
make
me
believe
that
there
a
good
deal
of
show
about
it
anyhow
with
such
a
chain
hanging
to
it
my
husband
gave
it
to
me
you
know
chain
and
all
i
must
wear
it
diana
said
with
a
face
as
sweet
as
the
roses
oh
yes
your
husband
starling
answered
insultingly
that
will
do
to
say
to
other
people
much
you
care
what
your
husband
does
diana
got
up
here
left
her
churn
came
up
to
her
mother
and
put
a
hand
upon
her
arm
the
action
and
air
of
the
woman
were
so
commanding
that
even
starling
stood
still
with
a
certain
involuntary
deference
diana
face
and
voice
however
were
as
clear
and
calm
as
they
were
commanding
mother
she
said
you
are
mistaken
i
care
with
all
there
is
of
me
heart
and
soul
and
life
starling
eye
shrank
away
since
when
she
asked
incredulously
it
does
not
matter
since
when
whatever
i
have
ever
felt
for
other
people
there
is
only
one
person
in
the
world
that
i
care
for
now
and
that
is
my
husband
you
better
tell
him
so
sneered
starling
when
do
you
expect
your
butter
is
going
to
come
if
you
stand
there
the
butter
is
come
said
diana
gently
she
knew
the
sneer
was
meant
to
cover
uneasy
feeling
and
if
it
had
not
still
she
would
not
have
resented
it
she
never
resented
anything
now
that
was
done
to
herself
in
came
josh
with
the
foaming
pails
diana
hands
were
in
the
butter
and
her
mother
came
to
strain
the
milk
there
had
ought
to
be
three
quarts
more
that
ai
here
she
grumbled
they
ai
nowheres
else
then
answered
her
factotum
josh
you
do
strip
the
cows
clean
who
doos
then
said
josh
grinning
if
me
i
don
know
who
that
red
heifer
is
losin
on
her
milk
though
starlin
she
had
ought
to
be
fed
well
feed
her
then
cried
the
mistress
you
know
enough
for
that
you
must
keep
up
the
milk
this
month
josh
the
grass
is
diana
escaped
away
a
while
later
the
family
was
assembled
at
breakfast
where
the
child
inquired
starling
i
believe
she
is
out
in
the
garden
mother
she
ought
to
be
out
before
she
has
had
her
breakfast
good
for
her
o
she
has
had
her
breakfast
said
diana
this
was
nothing
new
diana
as
well
as
her
husband
was
glad
to
keep
the
little
one
from
starling
table
where
unless
they
wanted
her
to
be
fed
on
pork
and
pickles
and
the
like
it
was
difficult
to
have
a
harmonious
meal
it
was
often
difficult
at
any
rate
who
with
her
starling
went
on
her
father
was
with
her
now
prudence
is
looking
after
her
prudence
you
want
to
keep
a
girl
about
as
much
as
i
want
to
keep
a
boat
you
have
no
use
for
her
she
is
useful
just
now
put
in
the
dominie
why
ca
diana
take
care
of
her
own
child
and
feed
her
when
she
takes
her
own
meals
as
i
used
to
do
and
as
everybody
else
does
you
think
that
is
a
convenient
arrangement
for
all
parties
said
the
minister
i
hate
to
have
danglers
about
said
starling
if
anything
i
abominate
it
shiftlessness
i
always
found
my
ten
fingers
was
servants
enough
for
me
and
what
they
could
do
i
could
go
without
and
i
do
like
to
see
a
daughter
o
mine
sit
with
her
hands
before
her
and
livin
off
other
people
strength
diana
laughed
a
low
sweet
laugh
that
was
enough
to
smooth
away
the
wrinkles
out
of
anybody
mood
she
has
to
do
as
she
told
said
the
minister
sententiously
that
because
she
a
fool
do
you
think
so
basil
answered
with
unchanged
good
humour
never
took
my
lessons
from
anybody
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
and
you
are
spoiling
her
starling
added
inconsistently
i
wonder
you
have
starling
paused
to
consider
what
the
minister
meant
before
she
came
to
speech
again
he
rose
from
the
table
will
you
come
to
my
study
diana
after
breakfast
who
goin
to
make
my
cake
then
cried
the
mistress
of
the
house
society
to
meet
here
again
this
afternoon
i
make
it
mother
a
mountain
cake
if
you
like
said
diana
also
rising
basil
wo
want
me
all
the
morning
but
she
was
eager
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
to
her
and
hurried
after
him
he
had
seemed
to
her
more
than
usually
preoccupied
i
do
think
she
remarked
as
she
reached
the
study
the
society
eat
more
cake
than
their
work
is
worth
heresy
said
basil
smiling
they
do
do
much
sewing
basil
they
do
something
else
never
mind
let
them
come
and
have
a
good
time
it
wo
hurt
anybody
much
diana
looked
at
him
and
smiled
and
then
waited
anxiously
she
longed
for
some
words
from
basil
different
from
those
he
had
spoken
last
night
could
he
not
see
that
if
her
passion
for
evan
was
broken
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
look
grave
about
and
ought
he
not
to
be
jubilant
over
the
confession
she
had
just
made
to
her
mother
diana
was
jubilant
over
it
herself
she
had
set
that
matter
clear
at
last
it
is
true
basil
had
not
heard
the
confession
but
ought
he
not
to
divine
it
when
it
was
the
truth
if
i
do
not
just
him
said
diana
to
herself
at
least
he
is
the
only
one
i
care
for
in
all
the
world
that
would
have
made
him
glad
once
and
he
do
look
glad
does
he
expect
me
to
speak
out
and
tell
him
all
that
basil
did
not
look
as
if
he
expected
her
to
do
any
such
thing
he
was
rather
graver
than
usual
and
did
not
at
once
say
anything
through
the
open
window
came
the
air
still
damp
with
dew
laden
with
the
scent
of
honeysuckle
and
roses
jocund
with
the
shouts
of
birds
and
for
one
instant
diana
thoughts
swept
back
away
to
years
ago
with
a
wondering
recognition
of
the
change
in
herself
since
june
days
then
her
husband
began
to
speak
i
have
had
a
call
diana
a
call
you
have
a
good
many
of
them
always
basil
what
was
this
of
a
different
sort
a
call
for
me
not
a
call
upon
me
well
there
have
always
been
calls
you
too
in
plenty
ever
since
i
have
known
you
what
do
you
mean
this
is
a
call
to
me
to
leave
pleasant
valley
said
basil
watching
her
yet
without
seeming
to
do
so
diana
looked
bewildered
to
leave
pleasant
valley
why
and
where
would
you
go
basil
i
am
called
because
the
people
want
somebody
and
have
pitched
upon
me
the
place
is
a
manufacturing
town
not
very
far
from
boston
are
you
going
that
is
the
point
upon
which
i
desire
to
have
your
opinion
but
basil
the
people
here
want
you
too
grant
that
then
what
does
it
signify
whether
other
people
want
you
insomuch
as
the
people
are
more
in
numbers
and
far
more
needy
in
condition
want
you
more
said
diana
wistfully
that
is
the
plain
english
of
it
and
will
you
go
what
do
you
counsel
i
do
not
know
the
people
said
diana
breathless
nor
i
as
yet
the
church
that
calls
me
is
itself
a
rich
little
church
which
has
been
accustomed
i
am
afraid
for
some
time
to
a
dead
level
in
religion
they
must
want
you
then
badly
said
diana
that
was
how
pleasant
valley
was
five
years
ago
but
round
the
church
lies
on
every
hand
the
mill
population
for
whom
hardly
any
one
cares
they
need
not
one
man
but
many
nothing
is
done
for
them
they
are
almost
heathen
in
the
midst
of
a
land
called
christian
then
you
will
go
said
diana
looking
at
masters
and
wishing
that
he
would
speak
to
her
with
a
different
expression
of
face
it
was
calm
sweet
and
high
as
always
but
she
knew
he
thought
his
wife
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
and
yet
i
told
him
last
night
she
said
to
herself
really
she
was
thinking
more
of
that
than
of
this
other
subject
basil
had
unfolded
to
her
i
do
not
know
he
answered
how
would
you
like
to
run
over
there
with
me
and
take
a
look
at
the
place
i
have
a
very
friendly
invitation
to
come
and
bring
you
for
the
very
purpose
run
over
why
it
must
be
more
than
one
day
journey
one
runs
by
railway
said
basil
simply
what
do
you
think
will
you
go
o
yes
indeed
if
you
will
let
me
and
rosy
we
will
go
nowhere
without
rosy
diana
made
her
cake
like
one
in
a
dream
chapter
xxxv
babylon
the
journey
to
mainbridge
the
manufacturing
town
in
question
took
place
within
a
few
days
with
eager
cordiality
the
minister
and
his
family
were
welcomed
in
the
house
of
one
of
the
chief
men
of
the
church
and
of
the
place
and
made
very
much
at
home
it
was
a
phasis
of
social
life
which
diana
had
hardly
touched
ever
before
wealth
was
abounding
and
superabounding
the
house
was
large
the
luxury
of
furnishing
and
fitting
of
service
and
equipage
was
on
a
scale
she
had
never
seen
basil
was
amused
to
observe
that
she
did
not
seem
to
see
it
now
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
fitted
in
these
new
surroundings
as
though
her
life
had
been
lived
in
them
the
dress
of
the
wife
was
very
plain
certainly
her
muslins
were
not
costly
and
they
were
simply
made
yet
nobody
in
the
room
looked
so
much
dressed
as
she
it
was
the
dignity
of
her
beauty
that
so
attired
her
it
was
beauty
of
mind
and
body
both
and
both
made
the
grace
of
her
movements
and
the
grace
of
her
quiet
so
exquisite
as
it
was
basil
smiled
and
sighed
but
there
was
no
doubt
diana
saw
the
mill
people
the
minister
and
his
wife
were
taken
to
see
the
mills
of
course
divers
and
various
silk
mills
cotton
mills
iron
mills
the
machinery
and
the
work
done
by
it
were
fascinating
to
diana
and
delightful
the
mill
people
men
women
and
children
were
more
fascinating
by
far
though
in
a
far
different
way
she
watched
them
in
the
mills
she
watched
them
when
she
met
them
in
the
street
going
to
or
from
work
do
they
go
to
church
she
asked
once
of
brandt
their
entertainer
he
shook
his
head
they
are
tired
with
their
week
work
when
saturday
night
comes
and
want
to
rest
sunday
was
given
for
rest
he
said
looking
into
face
which
was
a
study
to
him
do
you
think
she
said
rest
of
body
is
a
poor
thing
without
rest
of
mind
mind
can
not
rest
unless
my
body
does
he
answered
laughing
take
it
the
other
way
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
have
rest
of
mind
make
you
forget
weariness
of
body
no
nor
you
either
said
he
then
i
am
sorry
for
you
and
i
wish
i
could
get
at
the
mill
people
why
to
tell
them
what
i
know
about
it
but
you
could
not
get
at
them
masters
they
are
in
the
mills
from
seven
till
seven
or
eight
and
come
out
tired
and
dirty
and
sunday
as
i
told
you
they
like
to
stay
at
home
and
rest
and
perhaps
clean
up
if
there
is
no
help
for
that
said
diana
there
ought
to
be
no
mills
and
no
manufacturers
what
are
silk
and
iron
to
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
basil
does
that
passage
in
the
revelation
mean
what
passage
said
brandt
here
is
a
bible
masters
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
find
the
place
i
am
afraid
from
your
expression
it
is
not
a
flattering
passage
for
us
millowners
what
are
the
words
you
refer
to
i
think
he
wanted
to
draw
out
diana
much
more
than
the
meaning
of
scripture
she
took
the
bible
a
little
doubtfully
and
glanced
at
basil
he
was
smiling
at
her
in
a
reassuring
way
but
did
not
at
all
offer
to
help
diana
thoughts
wandered
somewhat
and
she
turned
the
leaves
of
the
bible
unsuccessfully
where
is
it
basil
you
are
thinking
of
the
account
of
the
destruction
of
babylon
it
is
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
but
babylon
said
the
host
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
babylon
that
means
rome
does
it
here
the
chapter
said
diana
no
it
can
not
mean
rome
brandt
though
dean
stanley
seems
to
assume
that
it
does
in
spite
of
the
fact
which
he
naively
points
out
that
the
description
do
fit
what
then
basil
wo
you
explain
it
is
merely
an
assumption
of
old
testament
imagery
said
basil
at
a
time
when
lineal
israel
stood
for
the
church
of
god
upon
earth
babylon
represented
the
head
and
culmination
of
the
the
church
deadly
opponent
and
foe
babylon
in
the
apocalypse
but
means
that
of
which
nebuchadnezzar
old
babylon
was
the
type
and
what
is
that
the
power
of
this
world
of
which
satan
is
said
to
be
the
prince
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
masters
we
can
not
get
out
of
the
world
it
is
a
pretty
good
world
too
i
think
take
it
for
all
in
all
people
talk
of
being
worldly
and
not
worldly
but
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
why
not
diana
asked
well
now
ask
my
wife
brandt
answered
laughing
she
thinks
it
is
to
have
a
cockade
on
your
coachman
hat
it
is
not
worldly
to
have
the
coachman
or
the
carriage
and
she
do
object
to
a
coat
with
buttons
then
it
is
not
worldly
to
give
a
party
but
it
is
worldly
to
dance
it
is
very
worldly
to
play
cards
somewhere
and
my
eyes
are
not
sharp
enough
to
see
the
lines
diana
sat
with
her
book
in
her
hand
looking
up
at
the
speaker
a
look
so
fair
and
clear
and
grave
that
brandt
was
again
moved
by
curiosity
and
tempted
to
try
to
make
her
speak
can
make
it
out
he
said
smiling
why
yes
said
diana
but
there
is
no
it
is
very
simple
there
are
just
two
kingdoms
in
the
world
brandt
and
whatever
does
not
belong
to
the
one
belongs
to
the
other
whatever
is
not
for
god
is
for
the
world
then
your
definition
of
the
is
all
that
is
not
god
but
i
am
not
clear
yet
i
do
see
how
you
draw
the
line
take
my
mills
for
example
they
belong
to
this
profane
world
yet
i
must
run
them
is
that
worldly
yes
if
you
do
not
run
them
for
god
brandt
stared
a
little
i
confess
i
do
not
see
how
that
is
to
be
done
he
owned
the
business
that
you
can
not
do
for
god
you
had
better
not
do
at
all
said
diana
gently
but
spinning
cotton
spinning
cotton
or
anything
else
that
employs
men
and
makes
money
how
you
can
do
it
for
god
can
not
you
said
diana
in
the
same
way
you
can
employ
the
men
and
make
the
money
for
his
sake
and
in
his
service
but
that
is
coming
pretty
close
said
the
millowner
suppose
i
want
a
little
of
the
money
for
myself
and
my
family
i
am
speaking
too
much
said
diana
with
a
lovely
flush
on
her
cheek
and
looking
up
to
her
husband
i
wish
you
would
take
the
word
basil
i
hope
masters
is
going
to
be
a
little
more
merciful
to
the
weaknesses
of
ordinary
humanity
said
brandt
half
lightly
so
tremendous
a
preacher
have
i
never
heard
yet
basil
was
silent
and
diana
looked
down
at
the
volume
in
her
hand
wo
you
go
on
mrs
masters
said
her
host
what
do
you
find
for
me
there
i
was
looking
for
my
quotation
said
diana
i
had
not
got
it
quite
right
how
is
it
here
is
a
list
of
the
luxuries
in
which
babylon
traded
merchandise
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
of
pearls
and
fine
linen
and
purple
and
silk
and
scarlet
and
all
thyine
wood
and
all
manner
vessels
of
ivory
and
all
manner
vessels
of
most
precious
wood
and
of
brass
and
iron
and
marble
and
cinnamon
and
odours
and
ointments
and
frankincense
and
wine
and
oil
and
fine
flour
and
wheat
and
beasts
and
sheep
and
horses
and
chariots
souls
of
sounds
for
all
the
world
like
an
inventory
of
the
things
in
my
house
said
brandt
pray
what
of
all
that
do
you
like
all
those
things
for
in
one
hour
so
great
riches
is
come
to
nought
but
what
harm
in
these
things
or
most
of
them
mrs
masters
diana
glanced
up
at
basil
and
did
not
answer
he
answered
no
harm
so
long
as
business
and
the
fruits
of
business
are
kept
within
the
line
we
were
speaking
of
so
long
as
all
is
for
god
and
to
god
if
it
is
not
for
him
it
is
for
the
o
my
dear
mrs
masters
cried
brandt
running
in
here
you
are
i
was
looking
for
i
came
to
ask
shall
i
order
the
landau
for
five
to
drive
to
the
lake
diana
was
glad
to
have
the
conversation
broken
up
when
the
hour
for
the
drive
came
and
she
sank
into
the
luxurious
satiny
depths
of
the
landau
her
thoughts
involuntarily
recurred
to
it
the
carriage
was
so
very
comfortable
it
rolled
smoothly
along
over
good
roads
drawn
by
horses
the
motion
was
delightful
diana
thoughts
rolled
on
too
suddenly
brandt
leaned
over
towards
her
is
this
carriage
a
indulgence
mrs
masters
diana
started
i
do
know
she
said
ah
said
the
other
laughing
at
her
startled
face
i
am
glad
to
see
that
even
you
may
have
a
doubt
on
that
subject
you
can
not
blame
less
etherealized
persons
like
my
wife
and
me
if
we
go
on
contentedly
with
no
doubts
but
you
mistake
me
said
diana
you
said
you
did
not
know
because
i
do
know
you
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
if
i
knew
you
well
brandt
i
should
know
whether
this
carriage
is
the
lord
or
not
the
expression
of
the
gentleman
face
upon
this
was
hardly
agreeable
he
sat
back
in
his
seat
and
looked
at
the
prospect
and
so
diana
tried
to
do
but
for
a
time
the
landscape
to
her
was
indistinguishable
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
mills
and
the
mill
people
pale
apathetic
reserved
sometimes
stern
they
had
struck
her
painfully
as
a
set
of
people
who
did
not
own
kindred
with
other
classes
of
their
apart
alone
without
instruction
without
sympathy
not
enjoying
this
life
nor
on
the
way
to
enjoy
the
next
the
marks
of
poverty
were
on
them
too
abundantly
diana
mind
was
too
full
of
these
people
to
allow
her
leisure
for
the
beauties
of
nature
or
if
she
felt
these
to
let
her
feel
them
without
a
great
sense
of
contrast
then
she
did
not
know
whether
she
had
spoken
wisely
alone
in
her
room
at
night
with
basil
she
began
to
talk
about
it
she
wished
that
he
would
begin
but
he
did
not
so
she
must
basil
did
i
say
too
much
to
brandt
i
guess
not
diana
knew
by
the
tone
of
these
words
that
her
husband
was
on
this
subject
contented
what
do
you
think
of
the
mill
people
i
am
very
curious
to
find
out
what
impression
they
make
on
you
basil
said
diana
her
voice
trembling
they
break
my
heart
what
to
be
done
in
that
case
i
do
know
nothing
follows
upon
that
but
how
do
you
feel
very
much
as
if
i
would
like
to
prove
the
realizing
of
that
old
prophecy
whom
he
was
not
spoken
of
they
shall
see
and
they
that
have
not
heard
shall
understand
that
is
just
how
i
feel
basil
but
they
do
not
go
to
church
people
say
how
could
you
get
at
them
we
could
look
them
up
at
their
own
homes
we
could
arrange
meetings
for
them
that
they
would
like
we
could
work
ourselves
into
their
affections
by
degrees
and
the
door
would
be
open
for
us
to
bring
christ
in
we
could
give
them
help
too
where
help
is
needed
basil
do
you
feel
as
i
do
you
said
so
he
answered
with
a
grave
smile
o
i
do
said
diana
i
can
not
think
of
anything
lovelier
than
to
see
those
faces
change
with
the
knowledge
of
christ
then
you
would
be
willing
to
leave
our
present
field
of
work
it
does
not
seem
to
want
us
as
this
does
not
by
many
fold
would
your
mother
leave
pleasant
valley
no
how
then
di
about
you
the
first
question
is
duty
basil
i
think
mine
is
to
come
here
then
it
must
be
mine
said
diana
with
a
sort
of
disappointment
upon
her
that
he
should
speak
in
that
way
and
would
it
be
your
pleasure
too
why
certainly
basil
i
can
not
pleasure
to
be
apart
from
duty
thank
you
he
said
gently
and
i
thank
god
who
has
brought
you
so
far
in
your
as
to
know
that
diana
said
no
more
she
was
ready
to
cry
with
the
feeling
that
her
husband
thought
himself
to
have
so
little
to
do
with
her
pleasure
tears
however
were
not
much
in
her
way
and
she
did
not
shed
any
but
she
speculated
he
really
to
do
with
her
pleasure
it
was
different
certainly
once
she
had
craved
to
be
at
a
distance
from
him
she
could
remember
the
time
well
but
the
time
was
past
was
it
reasonable
to
expect
him
to
know
that
fact
he
had
thoroughly
learned
the
bitter
truth
that
her
heart
was
not
his
and
could
never
be
his
what
should
tell
him
that
the
conditions
of
things
were
changed
they
changed
diana
was
in
great
confusion
she
began
to
think
she
did
not
know
herself
she
did
not
hate
masters
any
more
nay
she
declared
to
herself
she
never
had
hated
him
she
always
had
liked
him
only
then
she
had
loved
evan
knowlton
and
now
that
was
gone
she
did
not
love
anybody
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
masters
should
not
be
contented
i
think
said
diana
to
herself
i
give
him
enough
of
my
heart
to
content
him
i
wonder
what
would
content
him
i
do
not
care
two
straws
for
anybody
else
in
all
the
world
he
would
say
if
i
told
him
that
he
would
say
it
is
a
negative
proposition
suppose
i
could
go
further
and
diana
cheeks
began
to
burn
suppose
i
could
i
could
not
possibly
stand
up
and
tell
him
so
i
can
not
he
ought
to
see
it
for
himself
but
he
does
not
he
ought
to
be
contented
i
think
he
might
be
contented
with
what
i
give
him
if
it
is
just
diana
broke
off
with
her
thoughts
very
much
disturbed
she
thought
she
did
not
love
her
husband
but
things
were
no
longer
clear
except
that
basil
persistent
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
they
had
changed
chafed
and
distressed
her
chapter
xxxvi
the
party
the
morning
of
the
next
day
was
spent
in
still
further
visits
to
still
more
mills
brandt
was
much
struck
with
the
direction
his
attention
seemed
to
take
you
are
very
fond
of
machinery
he
remarked
to
diana
yes
i
do
know
much
about
it
she
answered
surely
that
is
not
true
after
these
two
or
three
days
work
i
knew
about
it
before
yes
i
do
enjoy
it
brandt
with
you
and
masters
to
explain
things
to
me
but
it
is
the
people
that
interest
me
most
the
people
the
mill
hands
brandt
asked
yes
the
mill
hands
what
you
find
interesting
in
them
i
am
half
afraid
of
them
for
my
part
they
look
as
if
they
wanted
friends
so
much
friends
repeated
brandt
i
suppose
they
have
friends
among
themselves
why
should
not
they
well
it
is
time
you
had
a
change
of
society
i
think
my
husband
has
taken
you
among
the
mill
people
for
two
days
now
i
will
introduce
you
to
a
different
set
some
of
your
church
people
i
want
you
to
take
rest
this
afternoon
my
dear
masters
now
wo
you
so
as
to
be
able
to
enjoy
the
evening
i
am
sure
brandt
has
fatigued
you
to
death
i
never
can
stand
going
up
and
down
those
stairs
in
the
mills
and
standing
about
it
kills
me
i
wonder
how
they
bear
standing
at
the
looms
or
the
other
machines
all
day
they
o
they
are
accustomed
to
it
i
suppose
an
hour
or
two
of
it
breaks
down
now
rest
will
you
it
quite
a
great
occasion
one
of
our
greatest
men
among
the
millowners
and
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
church
you
and
masters
are
coming
to
take
care
of
gives
an
entertainment
to
his
daughter
a
bride
married
lately
just
come
home
and
just
going
away
again
you
see
all
our
best
people
now
please
go
and
rest
diana
went
to
her
room
and
rested
outwardly
in
her
mind
thoughts
were
very
busy
and
when
it
was
time
to
dress
they
were
hardly
diverted
from
their
subjects
it
was
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
instinct
that
diana
threw
her
beautiful
hair
into
the
wavy
masses
and
coils
which
were
more
graceful
than
she
knew
and
crowned
her
so
royally
and
in
the
like
manner
that
she
put
on
a
dress
of
soft
white
muslin
it
had
no
adornment
other
than
the
lace
which
finished
it
at
throat
and
wrists
she
looked
most
like
a
bride
herself
so
basil
thought
when
he
came
to
fetch
her
though
he
did
not
say
his
thought
fearing
lest
he
might
graze
something
in
her
mind
which
would
pain
her
he
often
withheld
words
for
such
a
reason
will
it
do
said
diana
seeing
him
look
at
her
too
good
for
the
occasion
said
basil
shaking
his
head
too
much
dressed
said
diana
i
thought
i
must
dress
as
much
as
i
could
is
it
too
much
basil
nobody
else
will
think
so
said
the
minister
with
a
queer
smile
do
think
so
you
are
just
as
you
ought
to
be
all
the
same
it
is
beyond
the
company
never
mind
come
downstairs
another
sort
of
criticism
my
dear
masters
not
a
bit
of
colour
you
will
be
taken
for
the
bride
yourself
all
in
white
except
your
beautiful
hair
wait
that
wo
do
let
me
try
if
i
ca
improve
things
a
little
do
you
mind
just
let
me
see
how
this
will
look
diana
submitted
patiently
and
brandt
officiously
fastened
a
knot
of
blue
ribband
in
her
bright
hair
she
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
effect
which
diana
could
not
see
however
when
they
had
reached
the
house
they
were
going
to
and
leaving
the
diana
took
her
husband
arm
to
go
down
to
the
company
he
detained
her
to
let
and
brandt
pass
on
before
and
then
with
a
quick
and
quiet
touch
of
his
fingers
removed
the
blue
bow
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
basil
said
diana
smiling
she
will
miss
it
so
shall
i
it
commonized
the
whole
thing
there
was
nothing
common
left
as
every
one
instantly
recognised
who
saw
diana
that
evening
a
presence
of
such
dignified
grace
a
face
of
such
lofty
and
yet
innocent
beauty
so
sweet
a
movement
and
manner
nobody
there
knew
anything
like
it
in
mainbridge
on
the
other
hand
it
was
diana
first
experience
of
a
party
beyond
the
style
and
degree
of
pleasant
valley
parties
she
found
immediately
that
she
was
by
much
the
plainest
dressed
woman
in
the
company
but
she
forgot
to
think
of
the
dresses
the
people
struck
her
with
so
much
surprise
of
course
everybody
was
introduced
to
her
and
everybody
said
the
same
things
they
hoped
she
liked
mainbridge
they
hoped
she
was
coming
to
live
among
them
masters
was
coming
to
the
church
was
he
and
how
did
he
like
the
looks
of
the
place
you
see
the
best
part
of
the
church
here
remarked
one
stout
elderly
lady
in
a
black
silk
and
with
flowers
in
her
cap
a
very
puffy
old
lady
you
see
just
the
best
of
them
and
the
best
what
do
you
call
the
best
part
of
a
church
diana
asked
looking
round
the
room
well
you
see
them
before
you
there
is
mr
waters
standing
by
the
piano
he
the
wealthiest
man
in
mainbridge
a
very
wealthy
man
the
one
with
his
head
a
little
bald
speaking
just
now
to
brandt
is
one
of
our
elders
he
pretty
comfortable
too
a
beautiful
place
he
has
have
you
seen
it
no
you
ought
to
have
gone
there
to
see
his
flowers
the
grounds
are
beautiful
laid
out
with
so
much
taste
but
if
you
are
fond
of
flowers
you
should
go
to
see
greenhouses
that
is
tillery
in
the
corner
between
the
two
young
ladies
in
white
tillery
greenhouses
extend
half
a
mile
or
would
if
they
were
set
in
a
line
you
know
are
there
any
poor
people
in
the
church
poor
people
the
article
called
for
seemed
to
be
rare
poor
people
there
are
a
few
i
believe
not
many
the
poor
people
go
to
the
mission
chapel
o
we
support
a
mission
that
down
in
the
mill
quarter
where
the
hands
live
i
mean
and
o
masters
a
young
lady
struck
in
here
you
are
coming
are
you
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
and
i
want
you
to
come
and
o
i
want
you
to
tell
me
one
thing
is
masters
very
strict
about
what
said
diana
smiling
about
anything
yes
he
is
very
strict
about
telling
the
truth
o
of
course
but
i
mean
about
other
things
what
one
may
do
or
do
is
he
strict
not
any
stricter
than
his
master
his
master
who
that
but
i
mean
does
he
make
a
fuss
about
dancing
i
never
saw
masters
make
a
fuss
about
anything
o
delightful
then
he
do
mind
you
know
masters
the
bible
says
david
danced
the
bible
tells
why
he
danced
too
said
diana
wholly
unable
to
keep
her
gravity
does
it
i
do
recollect
and
o
masters
i
want
to
know
another
thing
does
masters
use
the
episcopal
form
in
marrying
people
you
are
concerned
in
the
question
o
yes
i
might
be
you
know
one
of
these
days
and
i
always
think
the
episcopal
form
is
so
dignified
and
graceful
the
ring
and
all
that
the
presbyterian
form
is
so
and
ugly
o
masters
do
you
like
a
form
for
everything
before
diana
could
return
an
answer
to
this
somewhat
comprehensive
question
a
slight
sound
caused
her
to
forget
both
question
and
speaker
and
the
place
where
she
was
as
utterly
as
if
they
all
had
been
swept
from
the
sphere
of
the
actual
it
belonged
to
the
sweet
poise
and
calm
of
her
heart
and
life
that
she
was
able
to
keep
still
as
she
was
and
make
no
movement
and
give
no
sign
the
sound
she
had
heard
was
a
little
running
laugh
she
thought
it
came
from
the
next
room
yet
she
did
not
turn
her
head
to
look
that
way
though
it
could
have
been
uttered
she
knew
from
no
throat
but
one
the
young
lady
friend
reiterated
the
question
in
which
she
was
interested
and
diana
answered
i
do
not
know
how
nor
did
she
while
she
was
at
the
same
time
collecting
her
forces
and
reviewing
them
for
the
coming
skirmish
with
circumstances
evan
knowlton
was
here
at
mainbridge
how
could
it
possibly
be
and
even
as
the
thought
went
through
her
came
that
laugh
again
diana
mind
began
to
be
in
a
great
state
of
confusion
which
presently
concentred
itself
upon
the
one
point
of
keeping
a
calm
and
unmoved
exterior
and
to
her
surprise
this
became
easy
the
confusion
subsided
like
the
vibrations
of
which
have
been
brushed
by
a
harsh
hand
only
her
heart
beat
a
little
waiting
for
the
coming
encounter
shall
i
take
you
in
to
see
the
bride
brandt
here
presented
himself
offering
his
services
and
diana
rose
without
hesitation
and
put
her
arm
in
his
she
was
glad
however
that
their
progress
through
the
company
was
slow
she
hoped
evan
would
see
before
he
had
to
speak
to
her
she
herself
felt
ready
for
anything
it
was
with
a
strange
feeling
nevertheless
that
she
went
through
the
introduction
to
the
pale
lady
of
fashion
who
was
evan
second
choice
beyond
white
silk
and
diamonds
and
a
rather
delicate
appearance
diana
could
in
that
moment
discern
nothing
her
senses
did
not
seem
to
serve
her
well
the
lady
was
very
much
in
request
besides
amid
her
old
friends
and
acquaintances
and
there
was
no
chance
to
talk
to
her
then
followed
the
introduction
to
the
bridegroom
he
was
going
to
content
himself
with
a
bow
but
diana
stretched
out
her
hand
and
gave
his
a
warm
grasp
i
have
seen
captain
knowlton
before
she
said
simply
she
was
perfectly
quiet
now
but
she
saw
that
he
was
not
and
that
he
was
willing
to
take
refuge
with
other
claimants
upon
his
attention
to
escape
any
particular
words
with
her
she
stepped
back
and
gradually
got
behind
people
where
the
sight
of
her
could
not
distress
him
it
had
distressed
him
she
had
seen
that
was
it
on
her
account
or
on
his
own
gradually
watching
her
chances
she
was
able
to
work
her
way
back
into
the
other
room
which
was
comparatively
empty
and
there
she
sat
down
at
a
table
covered
with
photographs
she
would
go
away
she
thought
as
soon
as
it
could
gracefully
be
done
and
yet
she
would
have
liked
to
speak
a
few
words
with
evan
this
last
time
they
might
ever
be
together
what
made
him
embarrassed
in
meeting
her
with
his
bride
just
beside
him
that
ought
not
to
be
she
thought
the
company
had
almost
all
crowded
into
the
other
room
about
the
bride
and
were
fully
occupied
with
her
and
diana
was
alone
she
turned
over
the
photographs
and
reviewed
the
kings
and
queens
of
europe
with
no
sort
of
intelligence
as
to
their
families
or
nationalities
mechanically
just
to
cover
her
abstraction
and
to
seem
to
be
doing
something
then
suddenly
she
knew
that
evan
was
beside
her
he
had
come
round
and
entered
by
the
door
from
the
hall
and
now
they
both
stood
together
for
a
moment
shielded
by
a
corner
of
the
partition
wall
between
the
rooms
diana
had
risen
this
is
a
very
painful
meeting
captain
knowlton
said
after
a
silence
which
would
have
been
longer
if
he
had
dared
to
let
it
be
so
no
said
diana
looking
at
him
with
as
clear
and
fair
a
brow
as
if
she
had
been
the
moon
goddess
whose
name
she
bore
and
her
voice
was
very
sweet
not
painful
evan
why
should
it
be
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
i
did
know
you
were
here
he
went
on
hurriedly
in
evident
great
perturbation
and
we
did
not
know
you
were
here
i
had
no
notion
of
it
till
i
heard
your
voice
in
the
next
room
i
knew
it
instantly
i
would
have
spared
you
this
if
i
could
have
foreseen
it
spared
me
what
all
this
this
pain
i
know
it
must
be
pain
to
i
did
not
anticipate
it
why
should
it
be
pain
to
me
inquired
diana
steadily
i
know
your
feeling
i
would
not
have
brought
clara
into
your
presence
i
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
her
said
diana
in
the
same
quiet
way
looking
at
evan
fixedly
i
should
have
been
glad
to
see
more
of
her
and
learn
to
know
her
i
could
scarcely
speak
to
her
for
the
crowd
around
yes
she
is
a
great
favourite
and
everybody
is
eager
to
see
her
before
she
goes
you
are
going
away
soon
o
yes
to
my
post
i
hope
she
will
make
you
happy
evan
diana
said
gently
and
cordially
you
are
very
good
i
am
sure
i
do
want
you
to
think
diana
that
i
that
i
in
fact
have
forgotten
anything
you
can
not
forget
too
soon
she
answered
smiling
everything
that
clara
would
not
wish
you
to
remember
a
fellow
is
so
awfully
lonely
out
there
on
the
frontiers
he
said
mumbling
his
words
through
his
moustache
in
a
peculiar
way
you
will
not
be
lonely
now
i
hope
you
see
di
you
were
lost
to
me
if
i
could
only
think
of
you
as
happy
you
may
happy
he
repeated
looking
at
her
he
had
avoided
her
eyes
until
now
yes
then
have
forgotten
one
does
not
forget
said
diana
with
again
a
grave
smile
but
i
have
ceased
to
look
back
sorrowfully
but
you
are
married
then
light
flushed
into
diana
face
she
understood
evan
allusion
yes
she
said
to
somebody
who
has
my
whole
heart
but
you
are
married
to
mr
masters
he
went
on
incredulously
certainly
and
i
love
my
husband
with
all
the
strength
there
is
in
me
to
love
i
hope
your
wife
will
love
you
as
well
she
added
with
another
smile
a
different
one
which
was
exceedingly
aggravating
to
the
young
man
no
other
lips
could
wreathe
so
with
such
a
mingling
of
softness
and
strength
love
and
yes
happiness
captain
knowlton
had
seen
smiles
like
that
upon
those
lips
once
long
ago
never
a
brighter
or
more
confident
one
he
felt
unaccountably
injured
you
did
not
speak
so
when
i
saw
you
last
he
remarked
no
i
was
a
fool
said
diana
with
somewhat
unreasonable
perverseness
or
if
i
was
not
a
fool
i
was
weak
i
see
you
are
strong
now
said
the
young
officer
bitterly
i
was
never
strong
and
i
am
weak
still
i
have
not
forgotten
diana
you
ought
to
forget
evan
she
said
gently
it
impossible
said
he
hastily
turning
over
photographs
on
the
table
diana
would
have
answered
but
the
opportunity
was
gone
other
people
came
near
the
two
fell
apart
from
each
other
and
no
more
words
were
interchanged
between
them
it
grieved
but
did
not
astonish
basil
to
perceive
when
he
joined
diana
in
their
own
room
that
night
that
she
had
been
weeping
and
it
only
grieved
him
to
know
that
the
weeping
was
renewed
in
the
night
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
knew
it
and
diana
thought
he
was
asleep
through
it
all
tears
were
by
no
means
a
favourite
indulgence
with
her
this
night
the
spring
of
them
seemed
to
be
suddenly
unsealed
and
they
flowed
fast
and
free
and
were
not
to
be
checked
neither
did
diana
quite
clearly
know
what
moved
them
she
was
very
sorry
for
evan
yes
but
these
tears
she
was
shedding
were
not
painful
tears
it
came
home
to
her
all
the
sorrowful
waiting
months
and
years
that
basil
had
endured
on
her
account
but
sympathy
was
not
a
spring
large
enough
to
supply
such
a
flow
she
was
glad
those
months
were
ended
yet
they
were
not
ended
for
basil
did
not
know
the
facts
she
had
stated
with
so
much
clearness
to
his
whilome
rival
she
had
not
told
himself
and
he
did
not
guess
them
he
might
said
diana
to
herself
he
ought
at
the
same
time
she
knew
now
there
was
something
for
her
to
do
how
she
should
do
it
she
did
not
know
chapter
xxxvii
at
one
they
returned
to
pleasant
valley
that
day
and
basil
was
immediately
plunged
in
arrears
of
business
for
the
present
diana
had
to
attend
to
her
mother
whose
conversation
was
anything
but
agreeable
after
she
learned
that
her
had
accepted
the
call
to
mainbridge
ministers
are
made
of
stuff
very
like
common
people
she
declared
every
one
goes
where
he
can
get
the
most
you
know
masters
has
plenty
already
mother
plenty
of
his
own
those
that
have
most
already
are
always
the
ones
that
want
more
seen
that
a
thousand
times
if
a
man
property
lies
in
an
onion
likely
give
you
half
of
it
if
you
want
it
if
he
got
all
pleasant
valley
the
odds
are
he
wo
give
you
an
onion
diana
would
have
turned
the
conversation
but
starling
came
back
to
the
subject
what
do
you
suppose
you
are
going
to
do
with
me
mother
that
is
for
you
to
choose
you
know
where
ever
we
are
there
a
home
for
you
if
you
will
have
it
it
a
pleasure
to
your
husband
to
have
me
too
ai
it
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
him
to
do
what
is
right
complimentary
you
have
grown
very
fond
of
him
have
you
all
of
a
sudden
but
this
subject
diana
would
not
touch
not
to
her
mother
not
to
any
one
till
the
person
most
concerned
knew
the
truth
and
most
certainly
after
that
not
to
any
one
else
evan
had
been
told
there
had
been
a
reason
she
was
glad
she
had
told
him
what
do
you
suppose
i
do
in
mainbridge
starling
went
on
there
is
plenty
to
do
mother
it
is
because
there
is
so
much
to
do
that
we
are
going
dressing
and
giving
parties
i
always
knew
your
husband
held
himself
above
our
folks
he
be
suited
there
this
tried
diana
it
was
so
very
far
from
the
truth
she
fled
the
field
it
was
often
the
safest
way
but
she
was
very
sorry
for
her
mother
she
went
to
basil
study
where
now
no
one
was
and
sat
down
by
the
window
that
looked
into
the
garden
there
rosy
presently
caught
sight
of
her
came
to
her
and
climbed
up
into
her
lap
and
for
a
good
while
the
two
entertained
one
another
the
child
going
on
in
wandering
sweet
prattle
while
the
mother
thoughts
though
she
answered
her
kept
a
deeper
current
of
their
own
all
the
while
she
was
pondering
as
she
sat
there
and
smelled
the
roses
in
the
garden
and
talked
to
the
small
rose
in
her
lap
she
was
pondering
what
she
should
do
to
let
her
husband
know
what
she
now
knew
about
herself
one
would
say
the
simplest
way
would
be
to
tell
him
but
diana
with
all
her
simplicity
and
sweetness
had
a
new
england
nature
and
though
she
could
speak
frankly
enough
when
spoken
to
on
this
or
any
other
subject
she
shrank
from
volunteering
revelations
that
were
not
expected
of
her
revelations
that
were
so
intimate
and
belonged
to
her
very
inner
self
and
that
concerned
besides
so
vitally
her
relations
with
another
person
even
though
that
person
were
her
husband
at
the
mere
thought
of
doing
it
the
colour
stirred
uneasily
in
diana
face
why
could
not
basil
divine
looking
out
into
the
garden
both
mother
and
child
and
talking
very
busily
one
of
them
thinking
very
busily
the
other
neither
of
them
heard
basil
come
in
where
papa
rosy
was
at
the
moment
asking
in
a
tone
sufficiently
indicating
that
in
her
view
of
things
he
had
been
gone
long
enough
not
very
far
off
was
the
answer
close
behind
them
rosy
started
and
threw
herself
round
towards
her
father
and
diana
also
started
and
looked
up
and
in
her
face
not
less
than
in
the
little
one
there
was
a
flash
and
a
flush
of
sudden
pleasure
basil
stooped
to
put
his
lips
to
rosy
and
then
reading
more
than
he
knew
in
diana
eyes
he
carried
the
kiss
to
her
lips
also
it
was
many
a
day
since
he
had
done
the
like
and
diana
face
flushed
more
and
more
but
basil
had
taken
up
rosy
into
his
arms
and
was
interchanging
a
whole
harvest
of
caresses
with
her
diana
turned
her
looks
towards
the
garden
and
felt
ready
to
burst
into
tears
could
it
be
that
he
was
proud
and
intended
to
revenge
upon
her
the
long
avoidance
to
which
in
days
past
she
had
treated
him
not
like
what
she
knew
of
masters
and
diana
was
aware
she
was
unreasonable
but
it
was
sore
and
impatient
at
her
heart
and
she
wanted
to
be
in
rosy
place
and
basil
the
while
was
thinking
whether
by
his
unwonted
caress
he
had
grieved
or
distressed
his
wife
he
touched
her
shoulder
gently
and
said
forgive
me
forgive
you
what
said
diana
looking
round
my
taking
an
indulgence
that
perhaps
i
should
not
have
taken
you
are
very
much
mistaken
basil
said
diana
rising
and
her
voice
trembled
and
her
lips
quivered
she
thought
he
rather
cruel
now
but
i
have
troubled
you
he
said
looking
earnestly
at
her
diana
hesitated
and
the
quiver
of
her
lips
grew
more
uncontrollable
not
in
the
way
you
think
she
answered
how
then
he
asked
gently
but
i
troubled
you
how
di
the
last
two
words
were
spoken
with
a
very
tender
gentle
accentuation
and
they
broke
diana
down
she
laid
one
hand
on
her
husband
arm
and
the
other
with
her
face
in
it
on
his
shoulder
and
burst
into
tears
i
do
not
know
what
there
is
in
the
telegraphy
of
touch
and
look
and
tone
but
something
in
the
grip
of
diana
hand
and
in
her
action
altogether
wrought
a
sudden
change
in
basil
and
brought
a
great
revelation
he
put
his
little
girl
down
out
of
his
arms
and
took
his
wife
in
them
and
for
minutes
there
was
no
word
spoken
and
rosy
was
too
much
astonished
at
the
strange
motionless
hush
they
maintained
to
resent
at
first
her
own
dispossession
and
the
great
slight
which
had
been
done
her
there
had
come
a
into
the
room
by
mistake
and
not
finding
there
what
he
expected
to
find
he
was
flying
about
and
about
trying
in
vain
to
make
his
way
to
something
more
in
his
line
than
books
and
the
soft
buzz
of
the
creature
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
till
rosy
began
to
complain
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
utter
stillness
of
the
two
figures
beside
her
who
stood
like
statues
was
furthermore
not
a
little
jealous
of
seeing
what
she
considered
her
own
prerogative
usurped
by
another
and
finally
began
an
importunate
petitioning
to
be
taken
up
again
but
rosy
voice
never
neglected
before
was
not
heard
neither
of
them
heard
it
the
consciousness
that
was
nearest
was
overpowering
and
barred
out
every
other
diana
said
basil
at
last
in
a
whisper
and
she
looked
up
all
flushed
and
trembling
and
did
not
meet
his
eyes
neither
did
she
take
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
they
had
not
changed
their
position
diana
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
me
have
i
said
it
she
answered
with
a
moment
glance
and
smile
and
then
between
smiles
and
tears
her
head
sank
again
why
did
you
never
tell
me
before
he
said
with
a
breath
that
was
almost
a
sob
and
at
the
same
time
had
a
somewhat
imperative
accent
of
demand
in
it
i
did
not
know
myself
and
now
now
repeated
diana
half
laughing
yes
now
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
you
know
already
you
have
told
me
nothing
and
i
do
not
feel
that
i
know
anything
till
you
have
told
me
he
said
in
a
lighter
tone
hallo
rosy
what
the
matter
for
rosy
seeing
herself
entirely
to
all
appearance
supplanted
had
now
broken
out
into
open
lamentations
too
heartfelt
to
be
longer
disregarded
diana
gently
released
herself
and
stooped
down
and
took
the
child
up
perhaps
glad
of
a
diversion
but
rosy
instantly
stretched
out
her
arms
imploringly
to
go
to
her
father
i
was
jealous
of
a
little
while
ago
diana
remarked
as
the
exchange
was
made
but
at
that
word
basil
set
the
child
scarcely
in
his
arms
out
of
them
again
on
the
floor
and
folding
diana
in
them
anew
paid
her
some
of
the
long
arrear
of
caresses
so
many
a
day
withheld
ay
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
known
he
might
without
distressing
her
and
no
doubt
lips
can
do
no
more
silently
to
reveal
a
passion
of
affection
than
these
did
then
if
basil
had
had
a
revelation
made
to
him
perhaps
so
did
diana
but
i
hardly
think
diana
was
surprised
she
knew
something
of
the
depths
and
the
contained
strength
in
her
husband
character
but
it
is
safe
to
say
she
would
never
be
jealous
of
rosy
again
not
anything
like
these
demonstrations
had
ever
fallen
to
rosy
share
anything
meanwhile
prettier
than
diana
face
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
flushing
like
a
girl
her
lips
wreathing
with
smiles
hanging
on
the
eyelashes
still
but
with
flashes
and
sparkles
coming
and
going
in
the
usually
quiet
grey
eyes
dispossessed
rosy
on
the
floor
meanwhile
looked
on
in
astonishment
so
great
that
she
even
forgot
to
protest
basil
looked
down
at
her
at
last
and
laughed
rosy
has
had
a
lesson
he
said
picking
her
up
she
will
know
her
place
henceforth
come
di
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
how
came
this
about
i
do
know
basil
said
diana
meekly
where
did
it
begin
i
do
know
that
either
o
i
think
the
beginning
was
very
long
ago
when
i
learned
to
honour
you
so
thoroughly
honour
is
very
cold
work
do
talk
to
me
about
honour
said
basil
i
have
fed
and
supped
on
honour
and
felt
very
empty
well
you
have
had
it
said
diana
contentedly
go
on
when
did
it
change
into
something
else
it
has
not
changed
said
diana
mischievously
when
did
you
begin
to
give
me
something
better
do
you
know
basil
i
can
not
tell
i
was
not
conscious
myself
of
what
was
going
on
in
me
when
perhaps
since
soon
after
i
came
home
from
clifton
it
not
begun
then
how
soon
it
began
after
i
can
not
tell
it
was
so
gradual
when
did
you
discover
a
change
i
it
i
hardly
discovered
it
a
good
while
ago
i
think
but
i
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
it
was
i
wished
basil
it
is
very
odd
and
the
colour
rose
in
diana
cheeks
i
that
i
could
love
you
the
minister
smiled
and
there
was
a
suspicious
drop
in
his
eyes
which
i
think
to
hide
he
stooped
and
kissed
rosy
go
on
when
did
you
come
to
a
better
understanding
i
do
think
i
recognised
it
until
i
told
mother
not
a
great
while
ago
that
i
cared
for
nobody
in
the
world
but
you
but
that
was
different
i
meant
something
different
i
do
not
think
i
recognised
it
fully
until
you
will
think
me
very
strange
until
i
saw
evan
knowlton
and
then
said
basil
with
a
quick
look
at
his
wife
diana
eyes
were
dreamily
going
out
of
the
window
and
her
lips
wore
the
rare
smile
which
had
vexed
evan
and
which
he
himself
had
never
seen
on
them
before
that
day
then
he
ventured
to
remind
me
that
once
it
was
not
true
what
said
basil
laughing
your
mother
makes
very
confused
statements
rosy
he
was
mortified
i
think
that
i
did
not
seem
to
feel
more
at
seeing
him
and
then
he
dared
to
remind
me
that
i
had
married
a
man
i
did
not
diana
left
the
word
unspoken
and
then
then
i
knew
all
of
a
sudden
that
he
was
mistaken
that
if
it
had
been
true
once
it
was
true
no
longer
i
told
him
so
told
him
echoed
her
husband
i
told
him
he
will
make
that
mistake
no
more
then
pray
why
did
you
not
tell
the
person
most
concerned
i
could
not
i
thought
you
must
find
it
out
of
yourself
how
did
he
take
your
communication
basil
human
nature
is
a
very
strange
thing
i
think
do
you
know
i
think
he
was
sorry
poor
fellow
said
basil
can
you
understand
it
i
am
afraid
i
can
you
may
say
fellow
but
i
was
displeased
with
him
he
had
no
right
to
care
at
least
to
be
anything
but
glad
it
was
wrong
he
had
no
no
but
you
have
fought
a
fight
my
child
which
few
fight
and
come
off
with
victory
it
was
not
i
basil
said
diana
softly
it
was
the
power
that
bade
the
sea
be
still
never
could
have
conquered
never
let
us
thank
him
and
it
was
you
that
led
me
to
trust
in
him
basil
you
told
me
that
anything
i
trusted
christ
to
do
for
me
he
would
do
it
and
i
saw
how
you
lived
and
i
believed
first
because
you
believed
basil
was
silent
his
face
was
very
grave
and
very
sweet
i
am
rather
disappointed
in
evan
said
diana
after
a
pause
i
shall
always
feel
an
interest
in
him
but
do
you
know
basil
he
seems
to
me
i
knew
that
a
long
while
ago
i
knew
it
two
years
ago
but
i
would
not
recognise
it
then
leaving
her
place
she
knelt
down
beside
her
husband
and
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
o
basil
if
i
can
ever
make
up
to
you
hush
said
he
we
will
go
and
make
things
up
to
those
millworkers
in
mainbridge
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
diana
spoke
again
spoke
slowly
do
you
know
basil
the
millowners
in
mainbridge
seemed
to
me
to
want
something
done
for
them
quite
as
much
as
the
millworkers
i
make
the
charge
of
that
over
to
you
me
said
diana
why
not
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
them
what
do
you
think
they
need
basil
they
do
not
seem
to
me
to
have
the
least
idea
not
an
of
what
true
religion
is
they
would
be
very
much
astonished
to
hear
you
say
so
but
is
it
not
true
you
would
find
every
wealthy
community
more
or
less
like
mainbridge
would
i
that
does
not
alter
the
case
basil
no
do
you
think
things
are
different
here
in
pleasant
valley
diana
pondered
i
think
they
do
not
the
same
she
said
people
at
least
would
not
be
shocked
if
you
told
them
here
what
christian
living
is
and
there
are
some
who
know
it
by
experience
no
doubt
so
there
are
in
the
mainbridge
church
though
it
may
be
we
shall
find
them
most
among
the
poor
people
but
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
basil
show
them
what
a
life
lived
for
christ
is
we
will
both
show
them
but
in
my
case
people
lay
it
off
largely
on
the
bond
of
my
profession
then
when
we
have
shown
them
for
awhile
what
it
is
we
can
speak
of
it
with
some
hope
of
being
understood
has
anything
special
come
to
the
dominie
starling
asked
that
evening
when
after
prayers
the
minister
had
gone
to
his
study
why
mother
he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
thanksgiving
on
his
mind
that
nothing
very
uncommon
in
him
said
diana
smiling
what
happened
to
inquired
her
mother
next
eyeing
her
daughter
with
curious
eyes
why
do
you
ask
i
do
do
things
commonly
without
a
reason
when
folks
roll
their
words
out
like
butter
i
like
to
know
what
to
pay
i
can
not
imagine
what
manner
of
speech
that
can
be
said
diana
amused
well
it
was
just
now
and
it
was
your
husband
half
an
hour
ago
i
suppose
said
diana
gravely
now
that
when
people
feel
happy
it
makes
their
speech
flow
smoothly
and
you
feel
happy
said
starling
with
a
look
as
sharp
as
an
arrow
yes
mother
i
do
what
about
diana
hesitated
and
then
answered
with
a
kind
of
sweet
solemnity
all
earth
and
all
heaven
starling
was
silenced
for
a
minute
by
earth
i
suppose
you
mean
me
to
understand
things
in
the
future
and
things
in
the
past
everything
that
ever
happened
to
me
mother
has
turned
out
for
good
starling
looked
at
her
daughter
and
saw
that
she
meant
it
the
ways
o
the
world
she
muttered
scornfully
are
too
queer
for
anything
but
diana
let
the
imputation
lie
they
went
to
mainbridge
not
starling
but
the
others
and
you
may
think
of
them
as
happy
with
both
hands
full
of
work
they
live
in
a
house
just
a
little
bit
out
of
the
town
where
there
is
plenty
of
ground
for
gardens
and
the
air
is
not
poisoned
with
smoke
or
vapour
roses
and
honeysuckles
flourish
as
well
here
as
in
pleasant
valley
laburnums
are
here
too
dropping
fresh
gold
every
year
and
there
are
banks
of
violets
and
beds
of
lilies
and
in
the
crocuses
and
primroses
and
hyacinths
and
snowdrops
and
chrysanthemums
and
asters
and
all
sorts
of
splendours
and
sweetnesses
in
the
fall
for
even
diana
flowers
are
not
for
herself
alone
nor
even
for
her
children
alone
whose
special
pleasure
in
connection
with
them
is
to
make
nosegays
for
sick
and
poor
people
and
to
cultivate
garden
plots
in
order
to
have
the
more
to
give
away
and
not
diana
roses
and
honeysuckles
are
sweeter
than
the
fragrance
of
her
life
which
goes
through
all
mainbridge
rich
and
poor
look
to
that
house
as
a
point
of
light
and
centre
of
strength
to
the
poor
it
is
besides
a
treasury
of
comfort
there
is
no
telling
the
change
that
has
been
wrought
already
in
the
place
it
is
as
basil
meant
it
should
be
and
knew
it
would
be
it
is
as
it
always
is
when
the
box
is
broken
at
christ
feet
the
house
is
filled
with
the
odour
of
