the
clue
of
the
twisted
candle
by
edgar
wallace
chapter
i
the
from
victoria
to
lewes
had
been
held
up
at
three
bridges
in
consequence
of
a
derailment
and
though
john
lexman
was
fortunate
enough
to
catch
a
belated
connection
to
beston
tracey
the
wagonette
which
was
the
sole
communication
between
the
village
and
the
outside
world
had
gone
if
you
can
wait
half
an
hour
lexman
said
the
i
will
telephone
up
to
the
village
and
get
briggs
to
come
down
for
john
lexman
looked
out
upon
the
dripping
landscape
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
walk
he
said
shortly
and
leaving
his
bag
in
the
care
and
buttoning
his
mackintosh
to
his
chin
he
stepped
forth
resolutely
into
the
rain
to
negotiate
the
two
miles
which
separated
the
tiny
railway
station
from
little
tracey
the
downpour
was
incessant
and
likely
to
last
through
the
night
the
high
hedges
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
were
so
many
leafy
cascades
the
road
itself
was
in
places
ankle
deep
in
mud
he
stopped
under
the
protecting
cover
of
a
big
tree
to
fill
and
light
his
pipe
and
with
its
bowl
turned
downwards
continued
his
walk
but
for
the
driving
rain
which
searched
every
crevice
and
found
every
chink
in
his
waterproof
armor
he
preferred
indeed
welcomed
the
walk
the
road
from
beston
tracey
to
little
beston
was
associated
in
his
mind
with
some
of
the
finest
situations
in
his
novels
it
was
on
this
road
that
he
had
conceived
the
tilbury
between
the
station
and
the
house
he
had
woven
the
plot
which
had
made
gregory
standish
the
most
popular
detective
story
of
the
year
for
john
lexman
was
a
maker
of
cunning
plots
if
in
the
literary
world
he
was
regarded
by
superior
persons
as
a
writer
of
shockers
he
had
a
large
and
increasing
public
who
were
fascinated
by
the
wholesome
and
thrilling
stories
he
wrote
and
who
held
on
breathlessly
to
the
skein
of
mystery
until
they
came
to
the
denouement
he
had
planned
but
no
thought
of
books
or
plots
or
stories
filled
his
troubled
mind
as
he
strode
along
the
deserted
road
to
little
beston
he
had
had
two
interviews
in
london
one
of
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
filled
him
with
joy
he
had
seen
and
t
was
meredith
who
would
one
day
be
chief
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
and
was
now
an
assistant
commissioner
of
police
engaged
in
the
more
delicate
work
of
that
department
in
his
erratic
tempestuous
way
had
suggested
the
greatest
idea
for
a
plot
that
any
author
could
desire
but
it
was
not
of
that
john
lexman
thought
as
he
breasted
the
hill
on
the
slope
of
which
was
the
tiny
habitation
known
by
the
somewhat
magnificent
title
of
beston
priory
it
was
the
interview
he
had
had
with
the
greek
on
the
previous
day
which
filled
his
mind
and
he
frowned
as
he
recalled
it
he
opened
the
little
wicket
gate
and
went
through
the
plantation
to
the
house
doing
his
best
to
shake
off
the
recollection
of
the
remarkable
and
unedifying
discussion
he
had
had
with
the
moneylender
beston
priory
was
little
more
than
a
cottage
though
one
of
its
walls
was
an
indubitable
relic
of
that
establishment
which
a
pious
howard
had
erected
in
the
thirteenth
century
a
small
and
unpretentious
building
built
in
the
elizabethan
style
with
quaint
gables
and
high
chimneys
its
latticed
windows
and
sunken
gardens
its
rosary
and
its
tiny
meadow
gave
it
a
certain
manorial
completeness
which
was
a
source
of
great
pride
to
its
owner
he
passed
under
the
thatched
porch
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
broad
hallway
as
he
stripped
his
drenching
mackintosh
the
hall
was
in
darkness
grace
would
probably
be
changing
for
dinner
and
he
decided
that
in
his
present
mood
he
would
not
disturb
her
he
passed
through
the
long
passage
which
led
to
the
big
study
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
fire
burnt
redly
in
the
grate
and
the
snug
comfort
of
the
room
brought
a
sense
of
ease
and
relief
he
changed
his
shoes
and
lit
the
table
lamp
the
room
was
obviously
a
man
den
the
chairs
the
big
and
bookcase
which
covered
one
wall
of
the
room
the
huge
covered
with
books
and
manuscripts
spoke
unmistakably
of
its
owner
occupation
after
he
had
changed
his
shoes
he
refilled
his
pipe
walked
over
to
the
fire
and
stood
looking
down
into
its
glowing
heart
he
was
a
man
a
little
above
medium
height
slimly
built
with
a
breadth
of
shoulder
which
was
suggestive
of
the
athlete
he
had
indeed
rowed
in
his
boat
and
had
fought
his
way
into
the
of
the
amateur
boxing
championship
of
england
his
face
was
strong
lean
yet
his
eyes
were
grey
and
deep
his
eyebrows
straight
and
a
little
forbidding
the
mouth
was
big
and
generous
and
the
healthy
tan
of
his
cheek
told
of
a
life
lived
in
the
open
air
there
was
nothing
of
the
recluse
or
the
student
in
his
appearance
he
was
in
fact
a
typical
britisher
very
much
like
any
other
man
of
his
class
whom
one
would
meet
in
the
of
the
british
army
in
the
wardrooms
of
the
fleet
or
in
the
posts
of
the
empire
where
the
administrative
cogs
of
the
great
machine
are
to
be
seen
at
work
there
was
a
little
tap
at
the
door
and
before
he
could
say
come
in
it
was
pushed
open
and
grace
lexman
entered
if
you
described
her
as
brave
and
sweet
you
might
secure
from
that
brief
description
both
her
manner
and
her
charm
he
half
crossed
the
room
to
meet
her
and
kissed
her
tenderly
i
did
know
you
were
back
until
she
said
linking
her
arm
in
his
until
you
saw
the
horrible
mess
my
mackintosh
has
made
he
smiled
i
know
your
methods
watson
she
laughed
but
became
serious
again
i
am
very
glad
you
come
back
we
have
a
visitor
she
said
he
raised
his
eyebrows
a
visitor
whoever
came
down
on
a
day
like
this
she
looked
at
him
a
little
strangely
mr
kara
she
said
kara
how
long
has
he
been
here
he
came
at
there
was
nothing
enthusiastic
in
her
tone
i
ca
understand
why
you
do
like
old
kara
rallied
her
husband
there
are
very
many
reasons
she
replied
a
little
curtly
for
her
anyway
said
john
lexman
after
a
moment
thought
his
arrival
is
rather
opportune
where
is
he
he
is
in
the
the
priory
was
a
rambling
apartment
all
old
print
and
chrysanthemums
to
use
lexman
description
cosy
armchairs
a
grand
piano
an
almost
medieval
open
grate
faced
with
tiles
a
but
cheerful
carpet
and
two
big
silver
candelabras
were
the
principal
features
which
attracted
the
newcomer
there
was
in
this
room
a
harmony
a
quiet
order
and
a
soothing
quality
which
made
it
a
haven
of
rest
to
a
literary
man
with
jagged
nerves
two
big
bronze
bowls
were
filled
with
early
violets
another
blazed
like
a
pale
sun
with
primroses
and
the
early
woodland
flowers
filled
the
room
with
a
faint
fragrance
a
man
rose
to
his
feet
as
john
lexman
entered
and
crossed
the
room
with
an
easy
carriage
he
was
a
man
possessed
of
singular
beauty
of
face
and
of
figure
half
a
head
taller
than
the
author
he
carried
himself
with
such
a
grace
as
to
conceal
his
height
i
missed
you
in
town
he
said
so
i
thought
i
run
down
on
the
off
chance
of
seeing
he
spoke
in
the
tone
of
one
who
had
had
a
long
acquaintance
with
the
public
schools
and
universities
of
england
there
was
no
trace
of
any
foreign
accent
yet
remington
kara
was
a
greek
and
had
been
born
and
partly
educated
in
the
more
turbulent
area
of
albania
the
two
men
shook
hands
warmly
you
stay
to
dinner
kara
glanced
round
with
a
smile
at
grace
lexman
she
sat
uncomfortably
upright
her
hands
loosely
folded
on
her
lap
her
face
devoid
of
encouragement
if
lexman
does
object
said
the
greek
i
should
be
pleased
if
you
would
she
said
almost
mechanically
it
is
a
horrid
night
and
you
wo
get
anything
worth
eating
this
side
of
london
and
i
doubt
very
much
she
smiled
a
little
if
the
meal
i
can
give
you
will
be
worthy
of
that
what
you
can
give
me
will
be
more
than
sufficient
he
said
with
a
little
bow
and
turned
to
her
husband
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
deep
in
a
discussion
of
books
and
places
and
grace
seized
the
opportunity
to
make
her
escape
from
books
in
general
to
lexman
books
in
particular
the
conversation
flowed
i
read
every
one
of
them
you
know
said
kara
john
made
a
little
face
poor
devil
he
said
sardonically
on
the
contrary
said
kara
i
am
not
to
be
pitied
there
is
a
great
criminal
lost
in
you
thank
you
said
john
i
am
not
being
uncomplimentary
am
i
smiled
the
greek
i
am
merely
referring
to
the
ingenuity
of
your
plots
sometimes
your
books
baffle
and
annoy
me
if
i
can
not
see
the
solution
of
your
mysteries
before
the
book
is
half
through
it
angers
me
a
little
of
course
in
the
majority
of
cases
i
know
the
solution
before
i
have
reached
the
fifth
john
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
was
somewhat
piqued
i
flatter
myself
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
my
stories
will
end
until
the
last
chapter
he
said
kara
nodded
that
would
be
so
in
the
case
of
the
average
reader
but
you
forget
that
i
am
a
student
i
follow
every
little
thread
of
the
clue
which
you
leave
you
should
meet
said
john
with
a
laugh
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
to
poke
the
fire
t
t
meredith
he
is
the
most
ingenious
beggar
you
could
meet
we
were
at
caius
together
and
he
is
by
way
of
being
a
great
pal
of
mine
he
is
in
the
criminal
investigation
kara
nodded
there
was
the
light
of
interest
in
his
eyes
and
he
would
have
pursued
the
discussion
further
but
at
the
moment
dinner
was
announced
it
was
not
a
particularly
cheerful
meal
because
grace
did
not
as
usual
join
in
the
conversation
and
it
was
left
to
kara
and
to
her
husband
to
supply
the
deficiencies
she
was
experiencing
a
curious
sense
of
depression
a
premonition
of
evil
which
she
could
not
define
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
she
took
her
mind
back
to
the
events
of
the
day
to
discover
the
reason
for
her
unease
usually
when
she
adopted
this
method
she
came
upon
the
trivial
causes
in
which
apprehension
was
born
but
now
she
was
puzzled
to
find
that
a
solution
was
denied
her
her
letters
of
the
morning
had
been
pleasant
neither
the
house
nor
the
servants
had
given
her
any
trouble
she
was
well
herself
and
though
she
knew
john
had
a
little
money
trouble
since
his
unfortunate
speculation
in
roumanian
gold
shares
and
she
half
suspected
that
he
had
had
to
borrow
money
to
make
good
his
losses
yet
his
prospects
were
so
excellent
and
the
success
of
his
last
book
so
promising
that
she
probably
seeing
with
a
clearer
vision
the
unimportance
of
those
money
worries
was
less
concerned
about
the
problem
than
he
you
will
have
your
coffee
in
the
study
i
suppose
said
grace
and
i
know
you
excuse
me
i
have
to
see
chandler
on
the
mundane
subject
of
she
favoured
kara
with
a
little
nod
as
she
left
the
room
and
touched
john
shoulder
lightly
with
her
hand
in
passing
kara
eyes
followed
her
graceful
figure
until
she
was
out
of
view
then
i
want
to
see
you
kara
said
john
lexman
if
you
will
give
me
five
you
can
have
five
hours
if
you
like
said
the
other
easily
they
went
into
the
study
together
the
maid
brought
the
coffee
and
liqueur
and
placed
them
on
a
little
table
near
the
fire
and
disappeared
for
a
time
the
conversation
was
general
kara
who
was
a
frank
admirer
of
the
comfort
of
the
room
and
who
lamented
his
own
inability
to
secure
with
money
the
cosiness
which
john
had
obtained
at
little
cost
went
on
a
foraging
expedition
whilst
his
host
applied
himself
to
a
proof
which
needed
correcting
i
suppose
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
have
electric
light
here
kara
asked
quite
replied
the
other
why
i
rather
like
the
light
of
this
it
is
the
lamp
drawled
the
greek
and
made
a
little
grimace
i
hate
these
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
where
the
six
tall
white
waxen
candles
stood
out
from
two
wall
sconces
why
on
earth
do
you
hate
candles
asked
the
other
in
surprise
kara
made
no
reply
for
the
moment
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
presently
he
spoke
if
you
were
ever
tied
down
to
a
chair
and
by
the
side
of
that
chair
was
a
small
keg
of
black
powder
and
stuck
in
that
powder
was
a
small
candle
that
burnt
lower
and
lower
every
minute
my
god
john
was
amazed
to
see
the
perspiration
stand
upon
the
forehead
of
his
guest
that
sounds
thrilling
he
said
the
greek
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
silk
handkerchief
and
his
hand
shook
a
little
it
was
something
more
than
thrilling
he
said
and
when
did
this
occur
asked
the
author
curiously
in
albania
replied
the
other
it
was
many
years
ago
but
the
devils
are
always
sending
me
reminders
of
the
he
did
not
attempt
to
explain
who
the
devils
were
or
under
what
circumstances
he
was
brought
to
this
unhappy
pass
but
changed
the
subject
definitely
sauntering
round
the
cosy
room
he
followed
the
bookshelf
which
filled
one
wall
and
stopped
now
and
again
to
examine
some
title
presently
he
drew
forth
a
stout
volume
brazil
he
read
by
george
you
know
gathercole
john
was
filling
his
pipe
from
a
big
blue
jar
on
his
desk
and
nodded
met
him
once
a
taciturn
devil
very
short
of
speech
and
like
all
men
who
have
seen
and
done
things
less
inclined
to
talk
about
himself
than
any
man
i
kara
looked
at
the
book
with
a
thoughtful
pucker
of
brow
and
turned
the
leaves
idly
i
never
seen
him
he
said
as
he
replaced
the
book
yet
in
a
sense
his
new
journey
is
on
my
the
other
man
looked
up
on
your
behalf
yes
you
know
he
has
gone
to
patagonia
for
me
he
believes
there
is
gold
there
you
will
learn
as
much
from
his
book
on
the
mountain
systems
of
south
america
i
was
interested
in
his
theories
and
corresponded
with
him
as
a
result
of
that
correspondence
he
undertook
to
make
a
geological
survey
for
me
i
sent
him
money
for
his
expenses
and
he
went
you
never
saw
him
asked
john
lexman
surprised
kara
shook
his
head
that
was
not
began
his
host
not
like
me
you
were
going
to
say
frankly
it
was
not
but
then
i
realized
that
he
was
an
unusual
kind
of
man
i
invited
him
to
dine
with
me
before
he
left
london
and
in
reply
received
a
wire
from
southampton
intimating
that
he
was
already
on
his
lexman
nodded
it
must
be
an
awfully
interesting
kind
of
life
he
said
i
suppose
he
will
be
away
for
quite
a
long
time
three
years
said
kara
continuing
his
examination
of
the
bookshelf
i
envy
those
fellows
who
run
round
the
world
writing
books
said
john
puffing
reflectively
at
his
pipe
they
have
all
the
best
of
kara
turned
he
stood
immediately
behind
the
author
and
the
other
could
not
see
his
face
there
was
however
in
his
voice
an
unusual
earnestness
and
an
unusual
quiet
vehemence
what
have
you
to
complain
about
he
asked
with
that
little
drawl
of
his
you
have
your
own
creative
work
the
most
fascinating
branch
of
labour
that
comes
to
a
man
he
poor
beggar
is
bound
to
actualities
you
have
the
full
range
of
all
the
worlds
which
your
imagination
gives
to
you
you
can
create
men
and
destroy
them
call
into
existence
fascinating
problems
mystify
and
baffle
ten
or
twenty
thousand
people
and
then
at
a
word
elucidate
your
john
laughed
there
is
something
in
that
he
said
as
for
the
rest
of
your
life
kara
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
i
think
you
have
that
which
makes
life
worth
living
an
incomparable
lexman
swung
round
in
his
chair
and
met
the
other
gaze
and
there
was
something
in
the
set
of
the
other
handsome
face
which
took
his
breath
away
i
do
not
see
he
began
kara
smiled
that
was
an
impertinence
was
it
he
said
banteringly
but
then
you
must
forget
my
dear
man
that
i
was
very
anxious
to
marry
your
wife
i
do
suppose
it
is
secret
and
when
i
lost
her
i
had
ideas
about
you
which
are
not
pleasant
to
he
had
recovered
his
and
had
continued
his
aimless
stroll
about
the
room
you
must
remember
i
am
a
greek
and
the
modern
greek
is
no
philosopher
you
must
remember
too
that
i
am
a
petted
child
of
fortune
and
have
had
everything
i
wanted
since
i
was
a
you
are
a
fortunate
devil
said
the
other
turning
back
to
his
desk
and
taking
up
his
pen
for
a
moment
kara
did
not
speak
then
he
made
as
though
he
would
say
something
checked
himself
and
laughed
i
wonder
if
i
am
he
said
and
now
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
energy
what
is
this
trouble
you
are
having
with
vassalaro
john
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
over
to
the
fire
stood
gazing
down
into
its
depths
his
legs
wide
apart
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
kara
took
his
attitude
to
supply
an
answer
to
the
question
i
warned
you
against
vassalaro
he
said
stooping
by
the
other
side
to
light
his
cigar
with
a
spill
of
paper
my
dear
lexman
my
fellow
countrymen
are
unpleasant
people
to
deal
with
in
certain
he
was
so
obliging
at
first
said
lexman
half
to
himself
and
now
he
is
so
disobliging
drawled
kara
that
is
a
way
which
moneylenders
have
my
dear
man
you
were
very
foolish
to
go
to
him
at
all
i
could
have
lent
you
the
there
were
reasons
why
i
should
not
borrow
money
from
you
said
john
quietly
and
i
think
you
yourself
have
supplied
the
principal
reason
when
you
told
me
just
now
what
i
already
knew
that
you
wanted
to
marry
how
much
is
the
amount
asked
kara
examining
his
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
replied
john
with
a
short
laugh
and
i
have
two
thousand
five
hundred
shillings
at
this
will
he
wait
john
lexman
shrugged
his
shoulders
look
here
kara
he
said
suddenly
do
think
i
want
to
reproach
you
but
it
was
through
you
that
i
met
vassalaro
so
that
you
know
the
kind
of
man
he
kara
nodded
well
i
can
tell
you
he
has
been
very
unpleasant
indeed
said
john
with
a
frown
i
had
an
interview
with
him
yesterday
in
london
and
it
is
clear
that
he
is
going
to
make
a
lot
of
trouble
i
depended
upon
the
success
of
my
play
in
town
giving
me
enough
to
pay
him
off
and
i
very
foolishly
made
a
lot
of
promises
of
repayment
which
i
have
been
unable
to
i
see
said
kara
and
then
does
lexman
know
about
this
matter
a
little
said
the
other
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
chin
upon
his
chest
naturally
i
have
not
told
her
the
worst
or
how
beastly
unpleasant
the
man
has
he
stopped
and
turned
do
you
know
he
threatened
to
kill
me
he
asked
kara
smiled
i
can
tell
you
it
was
no
laughing
matter
said
the
other
angrily
i
nearly
took
the
little
whippersnapper
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
kicked
kara
dropped
his
hand
on
the
other
arm
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
he
said
i
am
laughing
at
the
thought
of
vassalaro
threatening
to
kill
anybody
he
is
the
biggest
coward
in
the
world
what
on
earth
induced
him
to
take
this
drastic
step
he
said
he
is
being
hard
pushed
for
money
said
the
other
moodily
and
it
is
possibly
true
he
was
beside
himself
with
anger
and
anxiety
otherwise
i
might
have
given
the
little
blackguard
the
thrashing
he
kara
who
had
continued
his
stroll
came
down
the
room
and
halted
in
front
of
the
fireplace
looking
at
the
young
author
with
a
paternal
smile
you
do
understand
vassalaro
he
said
i
repeat
he
is
the
greatest
coward
in
the
world
you
will
probably
discover
he
is
full
of
firearms
and
threats
of
slaughter
but
you
have
only
to
click
a
revolver
to
see
him
collapse
have
you
a
revolver
by
the
way
oh
nonsense
said
the
other
roughly
i
can
not
engage
myself
in
that
kind
of
it
is
not
nonsense
insisted
the
other
when
you
are
in
rome
et
cetera
and
when
you
have
to
deal
with
a
greek
you
must
use
methods
which
will
at
least
impress
him
if
you
thrash
him
he
will
never
forgive
you
and
will
probably
stick
a
knife
into
you
or
your
wife
if
you
meet
his
melodrama
with
melodrama
and
at
the
psychological
moment
produce
your
revolver
you
will
secure
the
effect
you
require
have
you
a
revolver
john
went
to
his
desk
and
pulling
open
a
drawer
took
out
a
small
browning
that
is
the
extent
of
my
armory
he
said
it
has
never
been
fired
and
was
sent
to
me
by
an
unknown
admirer
last
a
curious
christmas
present
said
the
other
examining
the
weapon
i
suppose
the
mistaken
donor
imagined
from
my
books
that
i
lived
in
a
veritable
museum
of
revolvers
sword
sticks
and
noxious
drugs
said
lexman
recovering
some
of
his
good
humour
it
was
accompanied
by
a
do
you
know
how
it
works
asked
the
other
i
have
never
troubled
very
much
about
it
replied
lexman
i
know
that
it
is
loaded
by
slipping
back
the
cover
but
as
my
admirer
did
not
send
ammunition
i
never
even
practised
with
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
that
is
the
post
explained
john
the
maid
had
one
letter
on
the
salver
and
the
author
took
it
up
with
a
frown
from
vassalaro
he
said
when
the
girl
had
left
the
room
the
greek
took
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
examined
it
he
writes
a
vile
fist
was
his
only
comment
as
he
handed
it
back
to
john
he
slit
open
the
thin
buff
envelope
and
took
out
half
a
dozen
sheets
of
yellow
paper
only
a
single
sheet
of
which
was
written
upon
the
letter
was
brief
i
must
see
you
without
fail
ran
the
scrawl
meet
me
at
the
crossroads
between
beston
tracey
and
the
eastbourne
road
i
shall
be
there
at
eleven
and
if
you
want
to
preserve
your
life
you
had
better
bring
me
a
substantial
it
was
signed
john
read
the
letter
aloud
he
must
be
mad
to
write
a
letter
like
that
he
said
i
meet
the
little
devil
and
teach
him
such
a
lesson
in
politeness
as
he
is
never
likely
to
he
handed
the
letter
to
the
other
and
kara
read
it
in
silence
better
take
your
revolver
he
said
as
he
handed
it
back
john
lexman
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
an
hour
yet
but
it
will
take
me
the
best
part
of
twenty
minutes
to
reach
the
eastbourne
will
you
see
him
asked
kara
in
a
tone
of
surprise
certainly
lexman
replied
emphatically
i
can
not
have
him
coming
up
to
the
house
and
making
a
scene
and
that
is
certainly
what
the
little
beast
will
will
you
pay
him
asked
kara
softly
john
made
no
answer
there
was
probably
pounds
in
the
house
and
a
cheque
which
was
due
on
the
morrow
would
bring
him
another
pounds
he
looked
at
the
letter
again
it
was
written
on
paper
of
an
unusual
texture
the
surface
was
rough
almost
like
blotting
paper
and
in
some
places
the
ink
absorbed
by
the
porous
surface
had
run
the
blank
sheets
had
evidently
been
inserted
by
a
man
in
so
violent
a
hurry
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
extravagance
i
shall
keep
this
letter
said
john
i
think
you
are
well
advised
vassalaro
probably
does
not
know
that
he
transgresses
a
law
in
writing
threatening
letters
and
that
should
be
a
very
strong
weapon
in
your
hand
in
certain
there
was
a
tiny
safe
in
one
corner
of
the
study
and
this
john
opened
with
a
key
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
he
pulled
open
one
of
the
steel
drawers
took
out
the
papers
which
were
in
it
and
put
in
their
place
the
letter
pushed
the
drawer
to
and
locked
it
all
the
time
kara
was
watching
him
intently
as
one
who
found
more
than
an
ordinary
amount
of
interest
in
the
novelty
of
the
procedure
he
took
his
leave
soon
afterwards
i
would
like
to
come
with
you
to
your
interesting
meeting
he
said
but
unfortunately
i
have
business
elsewhere
let
me
enjoin
you
to
take
your
revolver
and
at
the
first
sign
of
any
bloodthirsty
intention
on
the
part
of
my
admirable
compatriot
produce
it
and
click
it
once
or
twice
you
wo
have
to
do
grace
rose
from
the
piano
as
kara
entered
the
little
and
murmured
a
few
conventional
expressions
of
regret
that
the
stay
had
been
so
short
that
there
was
no
sincerity
in
that
regret
kara
for
one
had
no
doubt
he
was
a
man
singularly
free
from
illusions
they
stayed
talking
a
little
while
i
will
see
if
your
chauffeur
is
asleep
said
john
and
went
out
of
the
room
there
was
a
little
silence
after
he
had
gone
i
do
think
you
are
very
glad
to
see
me
said
kara
his
frankness
was
a
little
embarrassing
to
the
girl
and
she
flushed
slightly
i
am
always
glad
to
see
you
kara
or
any
other
of
my
friends
she
said
steadily
he
inclined
his
head
to
be
a
friend
of
your
husband
is
something
he
said
and
then
as
if
remembering
something
i
wanted
to
take
a
book
away
with
me
i
wonder
if
your
husband
would
mind
my
getting
it
i
will
find
it
for
do
let
me
bother
you
he
protested
i
know
my
without
waiting
for
her
permission
he
left
the
girl
with
the
unpleasant
feeling
that
he
was
taking
rather
much
for
granted
he
was
gone
less
than
a
minute
and
returned
with
a
book
under
his
arm
i
have
not
asked
lexman
permission
to
take
it
he
said
but
i
am
rather
interested
in
the
author
oh
here
you
are
he
turned
to
john
who
came
in
at
that
moment
might
i
take
this
book
on
mexico
he
asked
i
will
return
it
in
the
they
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
tail
light
of
the
motor
disappear
down
the
drive
and
returned
in
silence
to
the
drawing
room
you
look
worried
dear
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
smiled
faintly
is
it
the
money
she
asked
anxiously
for
a
moment
he
was
tempted
to
tell
her
of
the
letter
he
stifled
the
temptation
realizing
that
she
would
not
consent
to
his
going
out
if
she
knew
the
truth
it
is
nothing
very
much
he
said
i
have
to
go
down
to
beston
tracey
to
meet
the
last
train
i
am
expecting
some
proofs
he
hated
lying
to
her
and
even
an
innocuous
lie
of
this
character
was
repugnant
to
him
i
afraid
you
have
had
a
dull
evening
he
said
kara
was
not
very
she
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
he
has
not
changed
very
much
she
said
slowly
he
a
wonderfully
handsome
chap
is
he
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
admiration
i
ca
understand
what
you
ever
saw
in
a
fellow
like
me
when
you
had
a
man
who
was
not
only
rich
but
possibly
the
man
in
the
she
shivered
a
little
i
have
seen
a
side
of
kara
that
is
not
particularly
beautiful
she
said
oh
john
i
am
afraid
of
that
man
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
afraid
he
asked
good
heavens
grace
what
a
thing
to
say
why
i
believe
he
do
anything
for
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
afraid
of
she
said
in
a
low
voice
she
had
a
reason
which
she
did
not
reveal
she
had
first
met
remington
kara
in
salonika
two
years
before
she
had
been
doing
a
tour
through
the
balkans
with
her
father
it
was
the
last
tour
the
famous
archeologist
made
and
had
met
the
man
who
was
fated
to
have
such
an
influence
upon
her
life
at
a
dinner
given
by
the
american
consul
many
were
the
stories
which
were
told
about
this
greek
with
his
face
his
handsome
carriage
and
his
limitless
wealth
it
was
said
that
his
mother
was
an
american
lady
who
had
been
captured
by
albanian
brigands
and
was
sold
to
one
of
the
albanian
chiefs
who
fell
in
love
with
her
and
for
her
sake
became
a
protestant
he
had
been
educated
at
yale
and
at
oxford
and
was
known
to
be
the
possessor
of
vast
wealth
and
was
virtually
king
of
a
hill
district
forty
miles
out
of
durazzo
here
he
reigned
supreme
occupying
a
beautiful
house
which
he
had
built
by
an
italian
architect
and
the
fittings
and
appointments
of
which
had
been
imported
from
the
luxurious
centres
of
the
world
in
albania
they
called
him
kara
rumo
which
meant
the
black
roman
for
no
particular
reason
so
far
as
any
one
could
judge
for
his
skin
was
as
fair
as
a
saxon
and
his
curls
were
almost
golden
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
grace
terrell
at
first
his
attentions
had
amused
her
and
then
there
came
a
time
when
they
frightened
her
for
the
man
fire
and
passion
had
been
unmistakable
she
had
made
it
plain
to
him
that
he
could
base
no
hopes
upon
her
returning
his
love
and
in
a
scene
which
she
even
now
shuddered
to
recall
he
had
revealed
something
of
his
wild
and
reckless
nature
on
the
following
day
she
did
not
see
him
but
two
days
later
when
returning
through
the
bazaar
from
a
dance
which
had
been
given
by
the
governor
general
her
carriage
was
stopped
she
was
forcibly
dragged
from
its
interior
and
her
cries
were
stifled
with
a
cloth
impregnated
with
a
scent
of
a
peculiar
aromatic
sweetness
her
assailants
were
about
to
thrust
her
into
another
carriage
when
a
party
of
british
bluejackets
who
had
been
on
leave
came
upon
the
scene
and
without
knowing
anything
of
the
nationality
of
the
girl
had
rescued
her
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
did
not
doubt
kara
complicity
in
this
medieval
attempt
to
gain
a
wife
but
of
this
adventure
she
had
told
her
husband
nothing
until
her
marriage
she
was
constantly
receiving
valuable
presents
which
she
as
constantly
returned
to
the
only
address
she
knew
kara
estate
at
lemazo
a
few
months
after
her
marriage
she
had
learned
through
the
newspapers
that
this
leader
of
greek
society
had
purchased
a
big
house
near
cadogan
square
and
then
to
her
amazement
and
to
her
dismay
kara
had
scraped
an
acquaintance
with
her
husband
even
before
the
honeymoon
was
over
his
visits
had
been
happily
few
but
the
growing
intimacy
between
john
and
this
strange
undisciplined
man
had
been
a
source
of
constant
distress
to
her
should
she
at
this
the
eleventh
hour
tell
her
husband
all
her
fears
and
her
suspicions
she
debated
the
point
for
some
time
and
never
was
she
nearer
taking
him
into
her
complete
confidence
than
she
was
as
he
sat
in
the
big
armchair
by
the
side
of
the
piano
a
little
drawn
of
face
more
than
a
little
absorbed
in
his
own
meditations
had
he
been
less
worried
she
might
have
spoken
as
it
was
she
turned
the
conversation
to
his
last
work
the
big
mystery
story
which
if
it
would
not
make
his
fortune
would
mean
a
considerable
increase
to
his
income
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
rose
she
helped
him
on
with
his
coat
he
stood
for
some
time
irresolutely
is
there
anything
you
have
forgotten
she
asked
he
asked
himself
whether
he
should
follow
kara
advice
in
any
circumstance
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
meet
a
ferocious
little
man
who
had
threatened
his
life
and
to
meet
him
unarmed
was
tempting
providence
the
whole
thing
was
of
course
ridiculous
but
it
was
ridiculous
that
he
should
have
borrowed
and
it
was
ridiculous
that
the
borrowing
should
have
been
necessary
and
yet
he
had
speculated
on
the
best
of
advice
it
was
kara
advice
the
connection
suddenly
occurred
to
him
and
yet
kara
had
not
directly
suggested
that
he
should
buy
roumanian
gold
shares
but
had
merely
spoken
glowingly
of
their
prospects
he
thought
a
moment
and
then
walked
back
slowly
into
the
study
pulled
open
the
drawer
of
his
desk
took
out
the
sinister
little
browning
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
i
sha
be
long
dear
he
said
and
kissing
the
girl
he
strode
out
into
the
darkness
kara
sat
back
in
the
luxurious
depths
of
his
car
humming
a
little
tune
as
the
driver
picked
his
way
cautiously
over
the
uncertain
road
the
rain
was
still
falling
and
kara
had
to
rub
the
windows
free
of
the
mist
which
had
gathered
on
them
to
discover
where
he
was
from
time
to
time
he
looked
out
as
though
he
expected
to
see
somebody
and
then
with
a
little
smile
he
remembered
that
he
had
changed
his
original
plan
and
that
he
had
fixed
the
waiting
room
of
lewes
junction
as
his
rendezvous
here
it
was
that
he
found
a
little
man
muffled
up
to
the
ears
in
a
big
top
coat
standing
before
the
dying
fire
he
started
as
kara
entered
and
at
a
signal
followed
him
from
the
room
the
stranger
was
obviously
not
english
his
face
was
sallow
and
peaked
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
the
beard
he
wore
was
unkempt
kara
led
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
dark
platform
before
he
spoke
you
have
carried
out
my
instructions
he
asked
brusquely
the
language
he
spoke
was
arabic
and
the
other
answered
him
in
that
language
everything
that
you
have
ordered
has
been
done
effendi
he
said
humbly
you
have
a
revolver
the
man
nodded
and
patted
his
pocket
loaded
excellency
asked
the
other
in
surprise
what
is
the
use
of
a
revolver
if
it
is
not
loaded
you
understand
you
are
not
to
shoot
this
man
said
kara
you
are
merely
to
present
the
pistol
to
make
sure
you
had
better
unload
it
wonderingly
the
man
obeyed
and
clicked
back
the
ejector
i
will
take
the
cartridges
said
kara
holding
out
his
hand
he
slipped
the
little
cylinders
into
his
pocket
and
after
examining
the
weapon
returned
it
to
its
owner
you
will
threaten
him
he
went
on
present
the
revolver
straight
at
his
heart
you
need
do
nothing
the
man
shuffled
uneasily
i
will
do
as
you
say
effendi
he
said
but
there
are
no
replied
the
other
harshly
you
are
to
carry
out
my
instructions
without
any
question
what
will
happen
then
you
shall
see
i
shall
be
at
hand
that
i
have
a
reason
for
this
play
be
but
suppose
he
shoots
persisted
the
other
uneasily
he
will
not
shoot
said
kara
easily
besides
his
revolver
is
not
loaded
now
you
may
go
you
have
a
long
walk
before
you
you
know
the
way
the
man
nodded
i
have
been
over
it
before
he
said
confidently
kara
returned
to
the
big
limousine
which
had
drawn
up
some
distance
from
the
station
he
spoke
a
word
or
two
to
the
chauffeur
in
greek
and
the
man
touched
his
hat
chapter
ii
assistant
commissioner
of
police
meredith
did
not
occupy
offices
in
new
scotland
yard
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
public
offices
that
they
are
planned
with
the
idea
of
supplying
the
margin
of
space
above
all
requirements
and
that
on
their
completion
they
are
found
wholly
inadequate
to
house
the
various
departments
which
mysteriously
come
into
progress
coincident
with
the
building
operations
t
as
he
was
known
by
the
police
forces
of
the
world
had
a
big
suite
of
offices
in
whitehall
the
house
was
an
old
one
facing
the
board
of
trade
and
the
inscription
on
the
ancient
door
told
that
this
was
the
public
prosecutor
special
the
duties
of
were
multifarious
people
said
of
him
and
like
most
public
gossip
this
was
probably
untrue
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
illegal
department
of
scotland
yard
if
by
chance
you
lost
the
keys
of
your
safe
could
supply
you
so
popular
rumour
ran
with
a
burglar
who
would
open
that
safe
in
half
an
hour
if
there
dwelt
in
england
a
notorious
individual
against
whom
the
police
could
collect
no
scintilla
of
evidence
to
justify
a
prosecution
and
if
it
was
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
community
that
that
person
should
be
deported
it
was
who
arrested
the
obnoxious
person
hustled
him
into
a
cab
and
did
not
loose
his
hold
upon
his
victim
until
he
had
landed
him
on
the
indignant
shores
of
an
otherwise
friendly
power
it
is
very
certain
that
when
the
minister
of
a
tiny
power
which
shall
be
nameless
was
suddenly
recalled
by
his
government
and
brought
to
trial
in
his
native
land
for
putting
into
circulation
spurious
bonds
it
was
somebody
from
the
department
which
controlled
who
burgled
his
excellency
house
burnt
the
locks
from
his
safe
and
secured
the
necessary
incriminating
evidence
i
say
it
is
fairly
certain
and
here
i
am
merely
voicing
the
opinion
of
very
knowledgeable
people
indeed
heads
of
public
departments
who
speak
behind
their
hands
mysterious
of
state
who
discuss
things
in
whispers
in
the
remote
corners
of
their
clubrooms
and
the
more
frank
views
of
american
correspondents
who
had
no
hesitation
in
putting
those
views
into
print
for
the
benefit
of
their
readers
that
had
a
more
legitimate
occupation
we
know
for
it
was
that
flippant
man
whose
outrageous
comment
on
the
home
office
administration
is
popularly
supposed
to
have
sent
one
home
secretary
to
his
grave
who
traced
the
deptford
murderers
through
a
labyrinth
of
perjury
and
who
brought
to
book
sir
julius
waglite
though
he
had
covered
his
trail
of
defalcation
through
the
balance
sheets
of
companies
on
the
night
of
march
sat
in
his
inner
office
interviewing
a
disconsolate
inspector
of
metropolitan
police
named
mansus
in
appearance
conveyed
the
impression
of
extreme
youth
for
his
face
was
almost
boyish
and
it
was
only
when
you
looked
at
him
closely
and
saw
the
little
creases
about
his
eyes
the
setting
of
his
straight
mouth
that
you
guessed
he
was
on
the
way
to
forty
in
his
early
days
he
had
been
something
of
a
poet
and
had
written
a
slight
volume
of
woodland
lyrics
the
mention
of
which
at
this
later
stage
was
sufficient
to
make
him
feel
violently
unhappy
in
manner
he
was
tactful
but
persistent
his
language
was
at
times
marked
by
a
violent
extravagance
and
he
had
had
the
distinction
of
having
provoked
by
certain
correspondence
which
had
seen
the
light
the
comment
of
a
former
home
secretary
that
it
was
unfortunate
that
meredith
did
not
take
his
position
with
the
seriousness
which
was
expected
from
a
public
his
language
was
as
i
say
under
great
provocation
violent
and
unusual
he
had
a
trick
of
using
words
which
never
were
on
land
or
sea
and
illustrating
his
instruction
or
his
admonition
with
the
quaintest
phraseology
now
he
was
tilted
back
in
his
office
chair
at
an
alarming
angle
scowling
at
his
distressed
subordinate
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
at
the
other
side
of
his
desk
but
protested
the
inspector
there
was
nothing
to
be
it
was
the
outrageous
practice
of
meredith
to
insist
upon
his
associates
calling
him
by
his
initials
a
practice
which
had
earnt
disapproval
in
the
highest
quarters
nothing
is
to
be
found
he
repeated
wrathfully
curious
mike
he
sat
up
with
a
suddenness
which
caused
the
police
officer
to
start
back
in
alarm
listen
said
grasping
an
ivory
paperknife
savagely
in
his
hand
and
tapping
his
to
emphasize
his
words
you
a
pie
i
a
policeman
said
the
other
patiently
a
policeman
exclaimed
the
exasperated
x
you
worse
than
a
pie
you
a
slud
i
afraid
i
shall
never
make
a
detective
of
you
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
at
the
smiling
mansus
who
had
been
in
the
police
force
when
was
a
small
boy
at
school
you
are
neither
wise
nor
wily
you
combine
the
innocence
of
a
baby
with
the
grubbiness
of
a
county
parson
you
ought
to
be
in
the
at
this
outrageous
insult
mansus
was
silent
what
he
might
have
said
or
what
further
provocation
he
might
have
received
may
be
never
known
for
at
that
moment
the
chief
himself
walked
in
the
chief
of
the
police
in
these
days
was
a
grey
man
rather
tired
with
a
hawk
nose
and
deep
eyes
that
glared
under
shaggy
eyebrows
and
he
was
a
terror
to
all
men
of
his
department
save
to
who
respected
nothing
on
earth
and
very
little
elsewhere
he
nodded
curtly
to
mansus
well
he
said
what
have
you
discovered
about
our
friend
kara
he
turned
from
to
the
discomforted
inspector
very
little
said
x
i
had
mansus
on
the
and
you
found
nothing
eh
growled
the
chief
he
has
found
all
that
it
is
possible
to
find
said
x
we
do
not
perform
miracles
in
this
department
sir
george
nor
can
we
pick
up
the
threads
of
a
case
at
five
minutes
sir
george
haley
grunted
mansus
has
done
his
best
the
other
went
on
easily
but
it
is
rather
absurd
to
talk
about
one
best
when
you
know
so
little
of
what
you
sir
george
dropped
heavily
into
the
and
stretched
out
his
long
thin
legs
what
i
want
he
said
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
putting
his
hands
together
is
to
discover
something
about
one
remington
kara
a
wealthy
greek
who
has
taken
a
house
in
cadogan
square
who
has
no
particular
position
in
london
society
and
therefore
has
no
reason
for
coming
here
who
openly
expresses
his
detestation
of
the
climate
who
has
a
magnificent
estate
in
some
wild
place
in
the
balkans
who
is
an
excellent
horseman
a
magnificent
shot
and
a
passable
nodded
to
mansus
and
with
something
of
gratitude
in
his
eyes
the
inspector
took
his
leave
now
mansus
has
departed
said
sitting
himself
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
and
selecting
with
great
care
a
cigarette
from
the
case
he
took
from
his
pocket
let
me
know
something
of
the
reason
for
this
sudden
interest
in
the
great
ones
of
the
sir
george
smiled
grimly
i
have
the
interest
which
is
the
interest
of
my
department
he
said
that
is
to
say
i
want
to
know
a
great
deal
about
abnormal
people
we
have
had
an
application
from
him
he
went
on
which
is
rather
unusual
apparently
he
is
in
fear
of
his
life
from
some
cause
or
other
and
wants
to
know
if
he
can
have
a
private
telephone
connection
between
his
house
and
the
central
office
we
told
him
that
he
could
always
get
the
nearest
police
station
on
the
but
that
does
satisfy
him
he
has
made
bad
friends
with
some
gentleman
of
his
own
country
who
sooner
or
later
he
thinks
will
cut
his
nodded
all
this
i
know
he
said
patiently
if
you
will
further
unfold
the
secret
dossier
sir
george
i
am
prepared
to
be
there
is
nothing
thrilling
about
it
growled
the
older
man
rising
but
i
remember
the
macedonian
shooting
case
in
south
london
and
i
want
a
repetition
of
that
sort
of
thing
if
people
want
to
have
blood
feuds
let
them
take
them
outside
the
metropolitan
by
all
means
said
let
them
personally
i
do
care
where
they
go
but
if
that
is
the
extent
of
your
information
i
can
supplement
it
he
has
had
extensive
alterations
made
to
the
house
he
bought
in
cadogan
square
the
room
in
which
he
lives
is
practically
a
sir
george
raised
his
eyebrows
a
safe
he
repeated
nodded
a
safe
he
said
its
walls
are
burglar
proof
floor
and
roof
are
reinforced
concrete
there
is
one
door
which
in
addition
to
its
ordinary
lock
is
closed
by
a
sort
of
steel
latch
which
he
lets
fall
when
he
retires
for
the
night
and
which
he
opens
himself
personally
in
the
morning
the
window
is
unreachable
there
are
no
communicating
doors
and
altogether
the
room
is
planned
to
stand
a
the
chief
commissioner
was
interested
any
more
he
asked
let
me
think
said
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
yes
the
interior
of
his
room
is
plainly
furnished
there
is
a
big
fireplace
rather
an
ornate
bed
a
steel
safe
built
into
the
wall
and
visible
from
its
outer
side
to
the
policeman
whose
beat
is
in
that
how
do
you
know
all
this
asked
the
chief
commissioner
because
i
been
in
the
room
said
simply
having
by
an
underhand
trick
succeeded
in
gaining
the
misplaced
confidence
of
housekeeper
who
by
the
way
he
turned
round
to
his
desk
and
scribbled
a
name
on
the

discharged

must
be
found

not
a

and
man

quite
normal
save
for
these
eccentricities
he
has
announced
his
intention
of
spending
three
months
of
the
year
in
england
and
nine
months
abroad
he
is
very
rich
has
no
relations
and
has
a
passion
for

he
be
hung
said
the
chief
rising
i
doubt
it
said
the
other
people
with
lots
of
money
seldom
get
hung
you
only
get
hung
for
wanting
then
you
in
some
danger
smiled
the
chief
for
according
to
my
account
you
always
more
or
less
a
genial
libel
said
but
talking
about
people
being
broke
i
saw
john
lexman
you
know
him
the
chief
commissioner
nodded
i
an
idea
he
rather
hit
for
money
he
was
in
that
roumanian
gold
swindle
and
by
his
general
gloom
which
only
comes
to
a
man
when
in
love
and
he
ca
possibly
be
in
love
since
he
married
or
when
he
in
debt
i
fear
that
he
is
still
feeling
the
effect
of
that
rosy
a
telephone
bell
in
the
corner
of
the
room
rang
sharply
and
picked
up
the
receiver
he
listened
intently
a
trunk
call
he
said
over
his
shoulder
to
the
departing
commissioner
it
may
be
something
a
little
pause
then
a
hoarse
voice
spoke
to
him
is
that
you

that
me
said
the
assistant

commonly

john

i
should
have
recognized

john
ca

want
you

the

urgently
and
even
over

chapter
iii
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
a
tragic
little
party
was
assembled
in
the
study
at
beston
priory
john
lexman
white
and
haggard
sat
on
the
sofa
with
his
wife
by
his
side
immediate
authority
as
represented
by
a
village
constable
was
on
duty
in
the
passage
outside
whilst
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
writing
pad
and
a
pencil
was
briefly
noting
the
evidence
the

had
sketched
the
events
of
the
day
he
had
described
his
interview
with
the
the

the
arrival
of
the
letter
you
have
the
letter
asked
john

nodded
i
am
glad
of
that
said
the
other
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
will
save
you
from
a
great
deal
of
unpleasantness
my
poor
old
chap
tell
me
what
happened
i
reached
the
village
said
john
lexman
and
passed
through
it
there
was
nobody
about
the
rain
was
still
falling
very
heavily
and
indeed
i
did
meet
a
single
soul
all
the
evening
i
reached
the
place
appointed
about
five
minutes
before
time
it
was
the
corner
of
eastbourne
road
on
the
station
side
and
there
i
found
vassalaro
waiting
i
was
rather
ashamed
of
myself
at
meeting
him
at
all
under
these
conditions
but
i
was
very
keen
on
his
not
coming
to
the
house
for
i
was
afraid
it
would
upset
grace
what
made
it
all
the
more
ridiculous
was
this
infernal
pistol
which
was
in
my
pocket
banging
against
my
side
with
every
step
i
took
as
though
to
nudge
me
to
an
understanding
of
my
where
did
you
meet
vassalaro
asked
x
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
eastbourne
road
and
crossed
the
road
to
meet
me
at
first
he
was
very
pleasant
though
a
little
agitated
but
afterward
he
began
to
behave
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
as
though
he
was
lashing
himself
up
into
a
fury
which
he
did
feel
i
promised
him
a
substantial
amount
on
account
but
he
grew
worse
and
worse
and
then
suddenly
before
i
realised
what
he
was
doing
he
was
brandishing
a
revolver
in
my
face
and
uttering
the
most
extraordinary
threats
then
it
was
i
remembered
kara
kara
said
quickly
a
man
i
know
and
who
was
responsible
for
introducing
me
to
vassalaro
he
is
immensely
i
see
said
go
i
remembered
this
warning
the
other
proceeded
and
i
thought
it
worth
while
trying
it
out
to
see
if
it
had
any
effect
upon
the
little
man
i
pulled
the
pistol
from
my
pocket
and
pointed
it
at
him
but
that
only
seemed
to
make
it
and
then
i
pressed
the
trigger
to
my
horror
four
shots
exploded
before
i
could
recover
sufficient
to
loosen
my
hold
of
the
butt
he
fell
without
a
word
i
dropped
the
revolver
and
knelt
by
his
side
i
could
tell
he
was
dangerously
wounded
and
indeed
i
knew
at
that
moment
that
nothing
would
save
him
my
pistol
had
been
pointed
in
the
region
of
his
heart
he
shuddered
dropping
his
face
in
his
hands
and
the
girl
by
his
side
encircling
his
shoulder
with
a
protecting
arm
murmured
something
in
his
ear
presently
he
recovered
he
was
quite
dead
i
heard
him
murmur
something
but
i
was
able
to
distinguish
what
he
said
i
went
straight
to
the
village
and
told
the
constable
and
had
the
body
rose
from
the
table
and
walked
to
the
door
and
opened
it
come
in
constable
he
said
and
when
the
man
made
his
appearance
i
suppose
you
were
very
careful
in
removing
this
body
and
you
took
everything
which
was
lying
about
in
the
immediate
vicinity
yes
sir
replied
the
man
i
took
his
hat
and
his
walkingstick
if
that
what
you
and
the
revolver
asked
x
the
man
shook
his
head
there
war
any
revolver
sir
except
the
pistol
which
lexman
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
it
out
gingerly
and
took
it
from
him
i
look
after
your
prisoner
you
go
down
to
the
village
get
any
help
you
can
and
make
a
most
careful
search
in
the
place
where
this
man
was
killed
and
bring
me
the
revolver
which
you
will
discover
probably
find
it
in
a
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
road
i
give
a
sovereign
to
the
man
who
finds
the
constable
touched
his
hat
and
went
out
it
looks
rather
a
weird
case
to
me
said
as
he
came
back
to
the
table
ca
you
see
the
unusual
features
yourself
lexman
it
unusual
for
you
to
owe
money
and
it
is
unusual
for
the
usurer
to
demand
the
return
of
that
money
but
in
this
case
he
is
asking
for
it
before
it
was
due
and
further
than
that
he
was
demanding
it
with
threats
it
is
not
the
practice
of
the
average
money
lender
to
go
after
his
clients
with
a
loaded
revolver
another
peculiar
thing
is
that
if
he
wished
to
blackmail
you
that
is
to
say
bring
you
into
contempt
in
the
eyes
of
your
friends
why
did
he
choose
to
meet
you
in
a
dark
and
unfrequented
road
and
not
in
your
house
where
the
moral
pressure
would
be
greatest
also
why
did
he
write
you
a
threatening
letter
which
would
certainly
bring
him
into
the
grip
of
the
law
and
would
have
saved
you
a
great
deal
of
unpleasantness
if
he
had
decided
upon
taking
action
he
tapped
his
white
teeth
with
the
end
of
his
pencil
and
then
suddenly
i
think
i
see
that
letter
he
said
john
lexman
rose
from
the
sofa
crossed
to
the
safe
unlocked
it
and
was
unlocking
the
steel
drawer
in
which
he
had
placed
the
incriminating
document
his
hand
was
on
the
key
when
noticed
the
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
what
is
it
asked
the
detective
suddenly
this
drawer
feels
very
hot
said
john
he
looked
round
as
though
to
measure
the
distance
between
the
safe
and
the
fire
laid
his
hand
upon
the
front
of
the
drawer
it
was
indeed
warm
open
it
said
and
lexman
turned
the
key
and
pulled
the
drawer
open
as
he
did
so
the
whole
contents
burst
up
in
a
quick
blaze
of
flame
it
died
down
immediately
and
left
only
a
little
coil
of
smoke
that
flowed
from
the
safe
into
the
room
do
touch
anything
inside
said
quickly
he
lifted
the
drawer
carefully
and
placed
it
under
the
light
in
the
bottom
was
no
more
than
a
few
crumpled
white
ashes
and
a
blister
of
paint
where
the
flame
had
caught
the
side
i
see
said
slowly
he
saw
something
more
than
that
handful
of
ashes
he
saw
the
deadly
peril
in
which
his
friend
was
standing
here
was
one
half
of
the
evidence
in
lexman
favour
gone
irredeemably
the
letter
was
written
on
a
paper
which
was
specially
prepared
by
a
chemical
process
which
disintegrated
the
moment
the
paper
was
exposed
to
the
air
probably
if
you
delayed
putting
the
letter
in
the
drawer
another
five
minutes
you
would
have
seen
it
burn
before
your
eyes
as
it
was
it
was
smouldering
before
you
had
turned
the
key
of
the
box
the
envelope
kara
burnt
it
said
lexman
in
a
low
voice
i
remember
seeing
him
take
it
up
from
the
table
and
throw
it
in
the
nodded
there
remains
the
other
half
of
the
evidence
he
said
grimly
and
when
an
hour
later
the
village
constable
returned
to
report
that
in
spite
of
his
most
careful
search
he
had
failed
to
discover
the
dead
revolver
his
anticipations
were
realized
the
next
morning
john
lexman
was
lodged
in
lewes
gaol
on
a
charge
of
wilful
murder
a
telegram
brought
mansus
from
london
to
beston
tracey
and
received
him
in
the
library
i
sent
for
you
mansus
because
i
suffer
from
the
illusion
that
you
have
more
brains
than
most
of
the
people
in
my
department
and
not
saying
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
sir
for
putting
me
right
with
commissioner
began
mansus
but
stopped
him
it
is
the
duty
of
every
head
of
departments
he
said
oracularly
to
shield
the
incompetence
of
his
subordinates
it
is
only
by
the
adoption
of
some
such
method
that
the
decencies
of
the
public
life
can
be
observed
now
get
down
to
he
gave
a
sketch
of
the
case
from
start
to
finish
in
as
brief
a
space
of
time
as
possible
the
evidence
against
lexman
is
very
heavy
he
said
he
borrowed
money
from
this
man
and
on
the
man
body
were
found
particulars
of
the
very
promissory
note
which
lexman
signed
why
he
should
have
brought
it
with
him
i
can
not
say
anyhow
i
doubt
very
much
whether
lexman
will
get
a
jury
to
accept
his
version
our
only
chance
is
to
find
the
revolver
i
do
think
there
any
very
great
chance
but
if
we
are
to
be
successful
we
must
make
a
search
at
before
he
went
out
he
had
an
interview
with
grace
the
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
told
of
a
sleepless
night
she
was
unusually
pale
and
surprisingly
calm
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
said
as
she
led
the
way
into
the
drawing
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
they
concern
kara
i
think
said
x
she
looked
at
him
startled
how
did
you
know
that
i
know
he
hesitated
on
the
brink
of
a
flippant
claim
of
omniscience
but
realizing
in
time
the
agony
she
must
be
suffering
he
checked
his
natural
desire
i
really
know
nothing
he
continued
but
i
guess
a
lot
and
that
was
as
near
to
the
truth
as
you
might
expect
to
reach
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
began
without
preliminary
in
the
first
place
i
must
tell
you
that
kara
once
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
for
reasons
which
i
will
give
you
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
of
she
described
without
reserve
the
meeting
at
salonika
and
extravagant
rage
and
told
of
the
attempt
which
had
been
made
upon
her
does
john
know
this
asked
x
she
shook
her
head
sadly
i
wish
i
had
told
him
now
she
said
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
she
wrung
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
sorrow
and
remorse
looked
at
her
sympathetically
then
he
asked
did
kara
ever
discuss
your
husband
financial
position
with
you
how
did
john
lexman
happen
to
meet
vassalaro
i
can
tell
you
that
she
answered
the
first
time
we
met
kara
in
england
was
when
we
were
staying
at
babbacombe
on
a
summer
holiday
which
was
really
a
prolongation
of
our
honeymoon
kara
came
to
stay
at
the
same
hotel
i
think
vassalaro
must
have
been
there
before
at
any
rate
they
knew
one
another
and
after
kara
introduction
to
my
husband
the
rest
was
easy
can
i
do
anything
for
john
she
asked
piteously
shook
his
head
so
far
as
your
story
is
concerned
i
do
think
you
will
advantage
him
by
telling
it
he
said
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
connect
kara
with
this
business
and
you
would
only
give
your
husband
a
great
deal
of
pain
i
do
the
best
i
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
grasped
it
and
somehow
at
that
moment
there
came
to
meredith
a
new
courage
a
new
faith
and
a
greater
determination
than
ever
to
solve
this
troublesome
mystery
he
found
mansus
waiting
for
him
in
a
car
outside
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
a
curious
little
knot
of
spectators
had
gathered
looking
with
morbid
interest
at
the
place
where
the
body
had
been
found
there
was
a
local
policeman
on
duty
and
to
him
was
deputed
the
ungracious
task
of
warning
his
fellow
villagers
to
keep
their
distance
the
ground
had
already
been
searched
very
carefully
the
two
roads
crossed
almost
at
right
angles
and
at
the
corner
of
the
cross
thus
formed
the
hedges
were
broken
admitting
to
a
field
which
had
evidently
been
used
as
a
pasture
by
an
adjoining
dairy
farm
some
rough
attempt
had
been
made
to
close
the
gap
with
barbed
wire
but
it
was
possible
to
step
over
the
drooping
strands
with
little
or
no
difficulty
it
was
to
this
gap
that
devoted
his
principal
attention
all
the
fields
had
been
carefully
examined
without
result
the
four
drains
which
were
merely
the
connecting
pipes
between
ditches
at
the
sides
of
the
crossroads
had
been
swept
out
and
only
the
broken
hedge
and
its
tangle
of
bushes
behind
offered
any
prospect
of
the
new
search
being
rewarded
hullo
said
mansus
suddenly
and
stooping
down
he
picked
up
something
from
the
ground
took
it
in
his
hand
it
was
unmistakably
a
revolver
cartridge
he
marked
the
spot
where
it
had
been
found
by
jamming
his
walking
stick
into
the
ground
and
continued
his
search
but
without
success
i
am
afraid
we
shall
find
nothing
more
here
said
after
half
an
hour
further
search
he
stood
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
a
frown
on
his
face
mansus
he
said
suppose
there
were
three
people
here
lexman
the
money
lender
and
a
third
witness
and
suppose
this
third
person
for
some
reason
unknown
was
interested
in
what
took
place
between
the
two
men
and
he
wanted
to
watch
unobserved
is
it
likely
that
if
he
as
i
think
instigated
the
meeting
he
would
have
chosen
this
place
because
this
particular
hedge
gave
him
a
chance
of
seeing
without
being
seen
mansus
thought
he
could
have
seen
just
as
well
from
either
of
the
other
hedges
with
less
chance
of
detection
he
said
after
a
long
pause
grinned
you
have
the
makings
of
a
brain
he
said
admiringly
i
agree
with
you
always
remember
that
mansus
that
there
was
one
occasion
in
your
life
when
meredith
and
you
thought
mansus
smiled
a
little
feebly
of
course
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
observer
this
was
the
worst
place
possible
so
whoever
came
here
if
they
did
come
here
dropping
revolver
bullets
about
must
have
chosen
the
spot
because
it
was
from
another
direction
obviously
he
could
come
down
the
road
and
climb
in
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
greek
who
was
waiting
for
lexman
we
may
suppose
there
is
a
gate
farther
along
the
road
we
may
suppose
that
he
entered
that
gate
came
along
the
field
by
the
side
of
the
hedge
and
that
somewhere
between
here
and
the
gate
he
threw
away
his
his
cigar
said
mansus
in
surprise
his
cigar
repeated
if
he
was
alone
he
would
keep
his
cigar
alight
until
the
very
last
he
might
have
thrown
it
into
the
road
said
mansus
do
jibber
said
and
led
the
way
along
the
hedge
from
where
they
stood
they
could
see
the
gate
which
led
on
to
the
road
about
a
hundred
yards
further
on
within
a
dozen
yards
of
that
gate
found
what
he
had
been
searching
for
a
cigar
it
was
sodden
with
rain
and
he
picked
it
up
tenderly
a
good
cigar
if
i
am
any
judge
he
said
cut
with
a
penknife
and
smoked
through
a
they
reached
the
gate
and
passed
through
here
they
were
on
the
road
again
and
this
they
followed
until
they
reached
another
cross
road
that
to
the
left
inclining
southward
to
the
new
eastbourne
road
and
that
to
the
westward
looking
back
to
the
railway
the
rain
had
obliterated
much
that
was
looking
for
but
presently
he
found
a
faint
indication
of
a
car
wheel
this
is
where
she
turned
and
backed
he
said
and
walked
slowly
to
the
road
on
the
left
and
this
is
where
she
stood
there
is
the
grease
from
her
he
stooped
down
and
moved
forward
in
the
attitude
of
a
russian
dancer
and
here
are
the
wax
matches
which
the
chauffeur
struck
he
counted
one
two
three
four
five
six
allow
three
for
each
cigarette
on
a
boisterous
night
like
last
night
that
makes
three
cigarettes
here
is
a
cigarette
end
mansus
gold
flake
brand
he
said
as
he
examined
it
carefully
and
a
gold
flake
brand
smokes
for
twelve
minutes
in
normal
weather
but
about
eight
minutes
in
gusty
weather
a
car
was
here
for
about
minutes
what
do
you
think
of
that
mansus
a
good
bit
of
reasoning
said
the
other
calmly
if
it
happens
to
be
the
car
you
looking
i
am
looking
for
any
old
car
said
x
he
found
no
other
trace
of
car
wheels
though
he
carefully
followed
up
the
little
lane
until
it
reached
the
main
road
after
that
it
was
hopeless
to
search
because
rain
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
drove
his
assistant
to
the
railway
station
in
time
to
catch
the
train
at
one
to
london
you
will
go
straight
to
cadogan
square
and
arrest
the
chauffeur
of
kara
he
said
upon
what
charge
asked
mansus
hurriedly
when
it
came
to
the
step
which
thought
fit
to
take
in
the
pursuance
of
his
duty
mansus
was
beyond
surprise
you
can
charge
him
with
anything
you
like
said
with
fine
carelessness
probably
something
will
occur
to
you
on
your
way
up
to
town
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
chauffeur
has
been
called
unexpectedly
away
to
greece
and
has
probably
left
by
this
morning
train
for
the
continent
if
that
is
so
we
can
do
nothing
because
the
boat
will
have
left
dover
and
will
have
landed
him
at
boulogne
but
if
by
any
luck
you
get
him
keep
him
busy
until
i
get
himself
was
a
busy
man
that
day
and
it
was
not
until
night
was
falling
that
he
again
turned
to
beston
tracey
to
find
a
telegram
waiting
for
him
he
opened
it
and
read
chauffeur
name
goole
formerly
waiter
english
club
constantinople
left
for
east
by
early
train
this
morning
his
mother
being
his
mother
ill
said
contemptuously
how
very
feeble
i
should
have
thought
kara
could
have
gone
one
better
than
he
was
in
john
lexman
study
as
the
door
opened
and
the
maid
announced
mr
remington
chapter
iv
folded
the
telegram
very
carefully
and
slipped
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
favoured
the
newcomer
with
a
little
bow
and
taking
upon
himself
the
honours
of
the
establishment
pushed
a
chair
to
his
visitor
i
think
you
know
my
name
said
kara
easily
i
am
a
friend
of
poor
so
i
am
told
said
but
do
let
your
friendship
for
lexman
prevent
your
sitting
for
a
moment
the
greek
was
nonplussed
and
then
with
a
little
smile
and
bow
he
seated
himself
by
the
writing
table
i
am
very
distressed
at
this
happening
he
went
on
and
i
am
more
distressed
because
i
feel
that
as
i
introduced
lexman
to
this
unfortunate
man
i
am
in
a
sense
if
i
were
you
said
leaning
back
in
the
chair
and
looking
half
questioningly
and
half
earnestly
into
the
face
of
the
other
i
should
let
that
fact
keep
me
awake
at
night
most
people
are
murdered
as
a
result
of
an
introduction
the
cases
where
people
murder
total
strangers
are
singularly
rare
that
i
think
is
due
to
the
insularity
of
our
national
again
the
other
was
taken
back
and
puzzled
by
the
flippancy
of
the
man
from
whom
he
had
expected
at
least
the
official
manner
when
did
you
see
vassalaro
last
asked
pleasantly
kara
raised
his
eyes
as
though
considering
i
think
it
must
have
been
nearly
a
week
think
again
said
x
for
a
second
the
greek
started
and
again
relaxed
into
a
smile
i
am
afraid
he
began
do
worry
about
that
said
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question
you
were
here
last
night
when
lexman
received
a
letter
that
he
did
receive
a
letter
there
is
considerable
evidence
he
said
as
he
saw
the
other
hesitate
because
we
have
the
supporting
statements
of
the
servant
and
the
i
was
here
said
the
other
deliberately
and
i
was
present
when
lexman
received
a
nodded
a
letter
written
on
some
brownish
paper
and
rather
bulky
he
suggested
again
there
was
that
momentary
hesitation
i
would
not
swear
to
the
color
of
the
paper
or
as
to
the
bulk
of
the
letter
he
said
i
should
have
thought
you
would
suggested
because
you
see
you
burnt
the
envelope
and
i
presumed
you
would
have
noticed
i
have
no
recollection
of
burning
any
envelope
said
the
other
easily
at
any
rate
went
on
when
lexman
read
this
letter
out
to
you
to
which
letter
are
you
referring
asked
the
other
with
a
lift
of
his
eyebrows
mr
lexman
received
a
threatening
letter
repeated
patiently
which
he
read
out
to
you
and
which
was
addressed
to
him
by
vassalaro
this
letter
was
handed
to
you
and
you
also
read
it
lexman
to
your
knowledge
put
the
letter
in
his
safe
in
a
steel
the
other
shook
his
head
smiling
gently
i
am
afraid
you
made
a
great
mistake
he
said
almost
apologetically
though
i
have
a
recollection
of
his
receiving
a
letter
i
did
not
read
it
nor
was
it
read
to
the
eyes
of
narrowed
to
the
very
slits
and
his
voice
became
metallic
and
hard
and
if
i
put
you
into
the
box
will
you
swear
that
you
did
not
see
that
letter
nor
read
it
nor
have
it
read
to
you
and
that
you
have
no
knowledge
whatever
of
such
a
letter
having
been
received
by
lexman
most
certainly
said
the
other
coolly
would
you
swear
that
you
have
not
seen
vassalaro
for
a
week
certainly
smiled
the
greek
that
you
did
not
in
fact
see
him
last
night
persisted
and
interview
him
on
the
station
platform
at
lewes
that
you
did
not
after
leaving
him
continue
on
your
way
to
london
and
then
turn
your
car
and
return
to
the
neighbourhood
of
beston
tracey
the
greek
was
white
to
the
lips
but
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
will
you
also
swear
continued
inexorably
that
you
did
not
stand
at
the
corner
of
what
is
known
as
mitre
lot
and
a
gate
near
to
the
side
where
your
car
was
and
that
you
did
not
watch
the
whole
tragedy
i
swear
to
that
kara
voice
was
strained
and
cracked
would
you
also
swear
as
to
the
hour
of
your
arrival
in
london
somewhere
in
the
region
of
ten
or
eleven
said
the
greek
smiled
would
you
swear
that
you
did
not
go
through
guilford
at
twelve
and
pull
up
to
replenish
your
petrol
the
greek
had
now
recovered
his
and
rose
you
are
a
very
clever
man
meredith
i
think
that
is
your
name
that
is
my
name
said
calmly
there
has
been
no
need
for
me
to
change
it
as
often
as
you
have
found
the
he
saw
the
fire
blazing
in
the
other
eyes
and
knew
that
his
shot
had
gone
home
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
said
kara
i
came
here
intending
to
see
lexman
and
i
had
no
idea
that
i
should
meet
a
my
dear
kara
said
rising
and
lighting
a
cigarette
you
will
go
through
life
enduring
that
unhappy
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
you
will
always
be
expecting
to
meet
one
person
and
meeting
another
and
unless
you
are
very
fortunate
indeed
that
other
will
always
be
a
his
eyes
twinkled
for
he
had
recovered
from
the
gust
of
anger
which
had
swept
through
him
there
are
two
pieces
of
evidence
i
require
to
save
lexman
from
very
serious
trouble
he
said
the
first
of
these
is
the
letter
which
was
burnt
as
you
yes
said
kara
leant
across
the
desk
how
did
you
know
he
snapped
somebody
told
me
i
do
know
who
it
that
not
true
replied
nobody
knows
except
myself
and
but
my
dear
good
fellow
said
kara
pulling
on
his
gloves
you
have
already
asked
me
whether
i
did
burn
the
i
said
envelope
said
with
a
little
laugh
and
you
were
going
to
say
something
about
the
other
clue
the
other
is
the
revolver
said
x
mr
lexman
revolver
drawled
the
greek
that
we
have
said
shortly
what
we
want
is
the
weapon
which
the
greek
had
when
he
threatened
there
i
afraid
i
can
not
help
kara
walked
to
the
door
and
followed
i
think
i
will
see
i
think
not
said
x
the
other
turned
with
a
sneer
have
you
arrested
her
too
he
asked
pull
yourself
together
said
coarsely
he
escorted
kara
to
his
waiting
limousine
you
have
a
new
chauffeur
i
observe
he
said
kara
towering
with
rage
stepped
daintily
into
the
car
if
you
are
writing
to
the
other
you
might
give
him
my
love
said
and
make
most
tender
enquiries
after
his
mother
i
particularly
ask
kara
said
nothing
until
the
car
was
out
of
earshot
then
he
lay
back
on
the
down
cushions
and
abandoned
himself
to
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
blasphemy
chapter
v
six
months
later
meredith
was
laboriously
tracing
an
elusive
line
which
occurred
on
an
ordnance
map
of
sussex
when
the
chief
commissioner
announced
himself
sir
george
described
as
the
most
wholesome
corrective
a
public
official
could
have
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
meeting
his
subordinate
as
he
said
for
this
reason
what
are
you
doing
there
he
growled
the
lesson
this
morning
said
without
looking
up
is
sir
george
passed
behind
his
assistant
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
that
is
a
very
old
map
you
have
got
there
he
said
it
shows
the
course
of
a
number
of
interesting
little
streams
in
this
neighbourhood
which
have
been
lost
sight
of
for
one
reason
or
the
other
by
the
gentleman
who
made
the
survey
at
a
later
period
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
in
one
of
these
streams
i
shall
find
what
i
am
you
have
given
up
hope
then
in
regard
to
lexman
i
shall
never
give
up
hope
said
until
i
am
dead
and
possibly
not
let
me
see
what
did
he
get
fifteen
years
fifteen
years
repeated
and
a
very
fortunate
man
to
escape
with
his
sir
george
walked
to
the
window
and
stared
out
on
to
busy
whitehall
i
am
told
you
are
quite
friendly
with
kara
made
a
noise
which
might
be
taken
to
indicate
his
assent
to
the
statement
i
suppose
you
know
that
gentleman
has
made
a
very
heroic
attempt
to
get
you
fired
he
said
i
should
wonder
said
x
i
made
as
heroic
an
attempt
to
get
him
hung
and
one
good
turn
deserves
another
what
did
he
do
see
ministers
and
people
he
did
said
sir
george
he
a
silly
ass
responded
x
i
can
understand
all
that
the
chief
commissioner
turned
round
but
what
i
can
not
understand
is
your
apology
to
there
are
so
many
things
you
do
understand
sir
george
said
tartly
that
i
despair
of
ever
cataloguing
you
are
an
insolent
cub
growled
his
chief
come
to
where
will
you
take
me
asked
cautiously
to
my
i
sorry
said
the
other
with
elaborate
politeness
i
have
lunched
once
at
your
club
need
i
say
more
he
smiled
as
he
worked
after
his
chief
had
gone
at
the
recollection
of
kara
profound
astonishment
and
the
gratification
he
strove
so
desperately
to
disguise
kara
was
a
vain
man
immensely
conscious
of
his
good
looks
conscious
of
his
wealth
he
had
behaved
most
handsomely
for
not
only
had
he
accepted
the
apology
but
he
left
nothing
undone
to
show
his
desire
to
create
a
good
impression
upon
the
man
who
had
so
grossly
insulted
him
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
stay
a
weekend
at
kara
little
place
in
the
country
and
had
found
there
assembled
everything
that
the
heart
could
desire
in
the
way
of
fellowship
eminent
politicians
who
might
conceivably
be
of
service
to
an
ambitious
young
assistant
commissioner
of
police
beautiful
ladies
to
interest
and
amuse
him
kara
had
even
gone
to
the
length
of
engaging
a
theatrical
company
to
play
sweet
lavender
and
for
this
purpose
the
big
ballroom
at
hever
court
had
been
transformed
into
a
theatre
as
he
was
undressing
for
bed
that
night
remembered
that
he
had
mentioned
to
kara
that
sweet
lavender
was
his
favorite
play
and
he
realized
that
the
entertainment
was
got
up
especially
for
his
benefit
in
a
score
of
other
ways
kara
had
endeavoured
to
consolidate
the
friendship
he
gave
the
young
commissioner
advice
about
a
railway
company
which
was
operating
in
asia
minor
and
the
shares
of
which
stood
a
little
below
par
thanked
him
for
the
advice
and
did
not
take
it
nor
did
he
feel
any
regret
when
the
shares
rose
pounds
in
as
many
weeks
had
superintended
the
disposal
of
beston
priory
he
had
the
furniture
removed
to
london
and
had
taken
a
flat
for
grace
lexman
she
had
a
small
income
of
her
own
and
this
added
to
the
large
royalties
which
came
to
her
as
she
was
bitterly
conscious
in
increasing
volume
as
the
result
of
the
publicity
of
the
trial
placed
her
beyond
fear
of
want
fifteen
years
murmured
as
he
worked
and
whistled
there
had
been
no
hope
for
john
lexman
from
the
start
he
was
in
debt
to
the
man
he
killed
his
story
of
threatening
letters
was
not
substantiated
the
revolver
which
he
said
had
been
flourished
at
him
had
never
been
found
two
people
believed
implicitly
in
the
story
and
a
sympathetic
home
secretary
had
assured
personally
that
if
he
could
find
the
revolver
and
associate
it
with
the
murder
beyond
any
doubt
john
lexman
would
be
pardoned
every
stream
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
dragged
in
one
case
a
small
river
had
been
dammed
and
the
bed
had
been
carefully
dried
and
sifted
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
weapon
and
had
tried
methods
more
effective
and
certainly
less
legal
a
mysterious
electrician
had
called
at
cadogan
square
in
absence
and
he
was
armed
with
such
indisputable
authority
that
he
was
permitted
to
penetrate
to
kara
private
room
in
order
to
examine
certain
fitments
kara
returning
next
day
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
when
it
was
reported
to
him
until
going
to
his
safe
that
night
he
discovered
that
it
had
been
opened
and
ransacked
as
it
happened
most
of
kara
valuable
and
confidential
possessions
were
at
the
bank
in
a
fret
of
panic
and
at
considerable
cost
he
had
the
safe
removed
and
another
put
in
its
place
of
such
potency
that
the
makers
offered
to
indemnify
him
against
any
loss
from
burglary
finished
his
work
washed
his
hands
and
was
drying
them
when
mansus
came
bursting
into
the
room
it
was
not
usual
for
mansus
to
burst
into
anywhere
he
was
a
slow
methodical
painstaking
man
with
a
deliberate
and
an
official
manner
what
the
matter
asked
quickly
we
did
search
vassalaro
lodgings
cried
mansus
breathlessly
it
just
occurred
to
me
as
i
was
coming
over
westminster
bridge
i
was
on
top
of
a
bus
wake
up
said
x
you
amongst
friends
and
cut
all
that
stuff
out
of
course
we
searched
vassalaro
lodgings
no
we
did
sir
said
the
other
triumphantly
he
lived
in
great
james
he
lived
in
the
adelphi
corrected
x
there
were
two
places
where
he
lived
said
mansus
when
did
you
learn
this
asked
his
chief
dropping
his
flippancy
this
morning
i
was
on
a
bus
coming
across
westminster
bridge
and
there
were
two
men
in
front
of
me
and
i
heard
the
word
and
naturally
i
pricked
up
my
it
was
very
unnatural
but
proceed
said
x
one
of
the
men
a
very
respectable
person
said
chap
vassalaro
used
to
lodge
in
my
place
and
i
still
got
a
lot
of
his
things
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
and
you
said
suggested
the
other
i
nearly
frightened
his
life
out
of
him
said
mansus
i
said
am
a
police
officer
and
i
want
you
to
come
along
with
me
and
of
course
he
shut
up
and
would
not
say
another
word
said
x
that
true
sir
said
mansus
but
after
awhile
i
got
him
to
talk
vassalaro
lived
in
great
james
street
on
the
third
floor
in
fact
some
of
his
furniture
is
there
still
he
had
a
good
reason
for
keeping
two
addresses
by
all
nodded
wisely
what
was
her
name
he
asked
he
had
a
wife
said
the
other
but
she
left
him
about
four
months
before
he
was
killed
he
used
the
adelphi
address
for
business
purposes
and
apparently
he
slept
two
or
three
nights
of
the
week
at
great
james
street
i
have
told
the
man
to
leave
everything
as
it
is
and
that
we
will
come
ten
minutes
later
the
two
officers
were
in
the
somewhat
gloomy
apartments
which
vassalaro
had
occupied
the
landlord
explained
that
most
of
the
furniture
was
his
but
that
there
were
certain
articles
which
were
the
property
of
the
deceased
man
he
added
somewhat
unnecessarily
that
the
late
tenant
owed
him
six
months
rent
the
articles
which
had
been
the
property
of
vassalaro
included
a
tin
trunk
a
small
writing
bureau
a
secretaire
bookcase
and
a
few
clothes
the
secretaire
was
locked
as
was
the
writing
bureau
the
tin
box
which
had
little
or
nothing
of
interest
was
unfastened
the
other

very
little
attention
without
any
difficulty
mansus
opened
both
the
leaf
of
the
bureau
when
let
down
formed
the
desk
and
piled
up
inside
was
a
whole
mass
of
letters
opened
and
unopened
accounts
and
all
the
paraphernalia
which
an
untidy
man
collects
letter
by
letter
went
through
the
accumulation
without
finding
anything
to
help
him
then
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
small
tin
case
thrust
into
one
of
the
oblong
pigeon
holes
at
the
back
of
the
desk
this
he
pulled
out
and
opened
and
found
a
small
wad
of
paper
wrapped
in
tin
foil
hello
hello
said
and
he
was
pardonably
exhilarated

a
man
stood
in
the
speckless
courtyard
before
the
governor
house
at
dartmoor
gaol
he
wore
the
ugly
livery
of
shame
which
marks
the
convict
his
head
was
clipped
short
and
there
was
two
days
growth
of
beard
upon
his
haggard
face
standing
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
waited
for
the
moment
when
he
would
be
ordered
to
his
work
john
lexman
o
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
as
he
had
looked
so
many
times
from
the
exercise
yard
and
wondered
what
the
day
would
bring
forth
a
day
to
him
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
an
eternity
he
dare
not
let
his
mind
dwell
upon
the
long
aching
years
ahead
he
dare
not
think
of
the
woman
he
left
or
let
his
mind
dwell
upon
the
agony
which
she
was
enduring
he
had
disappeared
from
the
world
the
world
he
loved
and
the
world
that
knew
him
and
all
that
there
was
in
life
all
that
was
worth
while
had
been
crushed
and
obliterated
into
the
granite
of
the
princetown
quarries
and
its
wide
horizon
shrunken
by
the
gaunt
moorland
with
its
menacing
tors
new
interests
made
up
his
existence
the
quality
of
the
food
was
one
the
character
of
the
book
he
would
receive
from
the
prison
library
another
the
future
meant
sunday
chapel
the
present
whatever
task
they
found
him
for
the
day
he
was
to
paint
some
doors
and
windows
of
an
outlying
cottage
a
cottage
occupied
by
a
warder
who
for
some
reason
on
the
day
previous
had
spoken
to
him
with
a
certain
kindness
and
a
certain
respect
which
was
unusual
face
the
wall
growled
a
voice
and
mechanically
he
turned
his
hands
still
behind
him
and
stood
staring
at
the
grey
wall
of
the
prison
storehouse
he
heard
the
shuffling
feet
of
the
quarry
gang
his
ears
caught
the
clink
of
the
chains
which
bound
them
together
they
were
desperate
men
peculiarly
interesting
to
him
and
he
had
watched
their
faces
furtively
in
the
early
period
of
his
imprisonment
he
had
been
sent
to
dartmoor
after
spending
three
months
in
wormwood
scrubbs
old
hands
had
told
him
variously
that
he
was
fortunate
or
unlucky
it
was
usual
to
have
twelve
months
at
the
scrubbs
before
testing
the
life
of
a
convict
establishment
he
believed
there
was
some
talk
of
sending
him
to
parkhurst
and
here
he
traced
the
influence
which
would
exercise
for
parkhurst
was
a
prisoner
paradise
he
heard
his
warder
voice
behind
him
right
turn
quick
he
walked
ahead
of
the
armed
guard
through
the
great
and
gloomy
gates
of
the
prison
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
walked
up
the
village
street
toward
the
moors
beyond
the
village
of
princetown
and
on
the
tavistock
road
where
were
two
or
three
cottages
which
had
been
lately
taken
by
the
prison
staff
and
it
was
to
the
decoration
of
one
of
these
that
o
had
been
sent
the
house
was
as
yet
without
a
tenant
a
under
the
charge
of
another
warder
was
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
painter
the
two
warders
exchanged
greetings
and
the
first
went
off
leaving
the
other
in
charge
of
both
men
for
an
hour
they
worked
in
silence
under
the
eyes
of
the
guard
presently
the
warder
went
outside
and
john
lexman
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
his
fellow
sufferer
he
was
a
man
of
or
lithe
and
alert
by
no
means
bad
looking
he
lacked
that
indefinable
suggestion
of
animalism
which
distinguished
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
at
dartmoor
they
waited
until
they
heard
the
warder
step
clear
the
passage
and
until
his
boots
were
tramping
over
the
cobbled
path
which
led
from
the
door
through
the
tiny
garden
to
the
road
before
the
second
man
spoke
what
are
you
in
for
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
murder
said
john
lexman
laconically
he
had
answered
the
question
before
and
had
noticed
with
a
little
amusement
the
look
of
respect
which
came
into
the
eyes
of
the
questioner
what
have
you
got
fifteen
years
said
the
other
that
means
years
and
months
said
the
first
man
you
never
been
here
before
i
suppose
hardly
said
lexman
drily
i
was
here
when
i
was
a
kid
confessed
the
i
am
going
out
next
john
lexman
looked
at
him
enviously
had
the
man
told
him
that
he
had
inherited
a
great
fortune
and
a
greater
title
his
envy
would
not
have
been
so
genuine
going
out
the
drive
in
the
brake
to
the
station
the
ride
to
london
in
creased
but
comfortable
clothing
free
as
the
air
at
liberty
to
go
to
bed
and
rise
when
he
liked
to
choose
his
own
dinner
to
answer
no
call
save
the
call
of
his
conscience
to
see
he
checked
himself
what
are
you
in
for
he
asked
in
conspiracy
and
fraud
said
the
other
cheerfully
i
was
put
away
by
a
woman
after
three
of
us
had
got
clear
with
pounds
damn
rough
luck
was
it
john
nodded
it
was
curious
he
thought
how
sympathetic
one
grows
with
these
exponents
of
crimes
one
naturally
adopts
their
point
of
view
and
sees
life
through
their
distorted
vision
i
bet
i
not
given
away
with
the
next
lot
the
prisoner
went
on
i
got
one
of
the
biggest
ideas
i
ever
had
and
i
got
a
real
good
man
to
help
how
asked
john
in
surprise
the
man
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
prison
larry
green
he
said
briefly
he
coming
out
next
month
too
and
we
are
all
fixed
up
proper
we
are
going
to
get
the
pile
and
then
we
off
to
south
america
and
you
wo
see
us
for
though
he
employed
all
the
colloquialisms
which
were
common
his
tone
was
that
of
a
man
of
education
and
yet
there
was
something
in
his
address
which
told
john
as
clearly
as
though
the
man
had
confessed
as
much
that
he
had
never
occupied
any
social
position
in
life
the
warder
step
on
the
stones
outside
reduced
them
to
silence
suddenly
his
voice
came
up
the
stairs
he
called
sharply
i
want
you
down
john
took
his
paint
pot
and
brush
and
went
clattering
down
the
uncarpeted
stairs
where
the
other
man
asked
the
warder
in
a
low
voice
he
upstairs
in
the
back
the
warder
stepped
out
of
the
door
and
looked
left
and
right
coming
up
from
princetown
was
a
big
grey
car
put
down
your
paint
pot
he
said
his
voice
was
shaking
with
excitement
i
am
going
upstairs
when
that
car
comes
abreast
of
the
gate
ask
no
questions
and
jump
into
it
get
down
into
the
bottom
and
pull
a
sack
over
you
and
do
not
get
up
until
the
car
the
blood
rushed
to
john
lexman
head
and
he
staggered
my
god
he
whispered
do
as
i
tell
you
hissed
the
warder
like
an
automaton
john
put
down
his
brushes
and
walked
slowly
to
the
gate
the
grey
car
was
crawling
up
the
hill
and
the
face
of
the
driver
was
half
enveloped
in
a
big
rubber
mask
through
the
two
great
goggles
john
could
see
little
to
help
him
identify
the
man
as
the
machine
came
up
to
the
gate
he
leapt
into
the
tonneau
and
sank
instantly
to
the
bottom
as
he
did
so
he
felt
the
car
leap
forward
underneath
him
now
it
was
going
fast
now
faster
now
it
rocked
and
swayed
as
it
gathered
speed
he
felt
it
sweeping
down
hill
and
up
hill
and
once
he
heard
a
hollow
rumble
as
it
crossed
a
wooden
bridge
he
could
not
detect
from
his
hiding
place
in
what
direction
they
were
going
but
he
gathered
they
had
switched
off
to
the
left
and
were
making
for
one
of
the
wildest
parts
of
the
moor
never
once
did
he
feel
the
car
slacken
its
pace
until
with
a
grind
of
brakes
it
stopped
suddenly
get
out
said
a
voice
john
lexman
threw
off
the
cover
and
leapt
out
and
as
he
did
so
the
car
turned
and
sped
back
the
way
it
had
come
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
was
alone
and
looked
around
far
away
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
grey
bulk
of
princetown
gaol
it
was
an
accident
that
he
should
see
it
but
it
so
happened
that
a
ray
of
the
sun
fell
athwart
it
and
threw
it
into
relief
he
was
alone
on
the
moors
where
could
he
go
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
he
was
standing
on
the
slope
of
a
small
tor
at
the
foot
there
was
a
smooth
stretch
of
green
sward
it
was
on
this
stretch
that
the
people
of
dartmoor
held
their
pony
races
in
the
summer
months
there
was
no
sign
of
horses
but
only
a
great
machine
with
pinions
of
taut
white
canvas
and
by
that
machine
a
man
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
brown
overalls
john
stumbled
down
the
slope
as
he
neared
the
machine
he
stopped
and
gasped
kara
he
said
and
the
brown
man
smiled
but
i
do
not
understand
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
lexman
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
place
of
safety
said
the
other
i
have
no
reason
to
be
grateful
to
you
as
yet
kara
breathed
lexman
a
word
from
you
could
have
saved
i
could
not
lie
my
dear
lexman
and
honestly
i
had
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
letter
if
that
is
what
you
are
referring
to
but
i
am
trying
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
and
for
your
my
wife
she
is
waiting
for
you
said
the
other
he
turned
his
head
listening
across
the
moor
came
the
dull
sullen
boom
of
a
gun
you
have
time
for
argument
they
discovered
your
escape
he
said
get
john
clambered
up
into
the
frail
body
of
the
machine
and
kara
followed
this
is
a
he
said
one
of
the
newest
models
of
he
clicked
over
a
lever
and
with
a
roar
the
big
tractor
screw
spun
the
aeroplane
moved
forward
with
a
jerk
ran
with
increasing
gait
for
a
hundred
yards
and
then
suddenly
the
jerky
progress
ceased
the
machine
swayed
gently
from
side
to
side
and
looking
over
the
passenger
saw
the
ground
recede
beneath
him
up
up
they
climbed
in
one
long
sweeping
ascent
passing
through
drifting
clouds
till
the
machine
soared
like
a
bird
above
the
blue
sea
john
lexman
looked
down
he
saw
the
indentations
of
the
coast
and
recognized
the
fringe
of
white
houses
that
stood
for
torquay
but
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
all
signs
of
the
land
were
blotted
out
talking
was
impossible
the
roar
of
the
engines
defied
penetration
kara
was
evidently
a
skilful
pilot
from
time
to
time
he
consulted
the
compass
on
the
board
before
him
and
changed
his
course
ever
so
slightly
presently
he
released
one
hand
from
the
driving
wheel
and
scribbling
on
a
little
block
of
paper
which
was
inserted
in
a
pocket
at
the
side
of
the
seat
he
passed
it
back
john
lexman
read
if
you
can
not
swim
there
is
a
life
belt
under
your
john
nodded
kara
was
searching
the
sea
for
something
and
presently
he
found
it
viewed
from
the
height
at
which
they
flew
it
looked
no
more
than
a
white
speck
in
a
great
blue
saucer
but
presently
the
machine
began
to
dip
falling
at
a
terrific
rate
of
speed
which
took
away
the
breath
of
the
man
who
was
hanging
on
with
both
hands
to
the
dangerous
seat
behind
he
was
deadly
cold
but
had
hardly
noticed
the
fact
it
was
all
so
incredible
so
impossible
he
expected
to
wake
up
and
wondered
if
the
prison
was
also
part
of
the
dream
now
he
saw
the
point
for
which
kara
was
making
a
white
steam
yacht
long
and
narrow
of
beam
was
steaming
slowly
westward
he
could
see
the
feathery
wake
in
her
rear
and
as
the
aeroplane
fell
he
had
time
to
observe
that
a
boat
had
been
put
off
then
with
a
jerk
the
monoplane
flattened
out
and
came
like
a
skimming
bird
to
the
surface
of
the
water
her
engines
stopped
we
ought
to
be
able
to
keep
afloat
for
ten
minutes
said
kara
and
by
that
time
they
will
pick
us
his
voice
was
high
and
harsh
in
the
almost
painful
silence
which
followed
the
stoppage
of
the
engines
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
boat
had
come
alongside
manned
as
lexman
gathered
from
a
glimpse
of
the
crew
by
greeks
he
scrambled
aboard
and
five
minutes
later
he
was
standing
on
the
white
deck
of
the
yacht
watching
the
disappearing
tail
of
the
monoplane
kara
was
by
his
side
there
goes
fifteen
hundred
pounds
said
the
greek
with
a
smile
add
that
to
the
two
thousand
i
paid
the
warder
and
you
have
a
tidy
some
things
are
worth
all
the
money
in
the
world
chapter
vii
came
from
downing
street
at
one
night
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
joy
and
gratitude
he
swung
his
stick
to
the
common
danger
of
the
public
but
the
policeman
on
point
duty
at
the
end
of
the
street
who
saw
him
recognized
and
saluted
him
did
not
think
it
fit
to
issue
any
official
warning
he
ran
up
the
stairs
to
his
office
and
found
mansus
reading
the
evening
paper
my
poor
dumb
beast
said
x
i
am
afraid
i
have
kept
you
waiting
for
a
very
long
time
but
tomorrow
you
and
i
will
take
a
little
journey
to
devonshire
it
will
be
good
for
you
mansus
where
did
you
get
that
ridiculous
name
by
the
way
m
or
replied
mansus
laconically
i
repeat
that
there
is
the
dawn
of
an
intellect
in
you
said
offensively
he
became
more
serious
as
he
took
from
a
pocket
inside
his
waistcoat
a
long
blue
envelope
containing
the
paper
which
had
cost
him
so
much
to
secure
finding
the
revolver
was
a
of
yours
mansus
he
said
and
he
was
in
earnest
as
he
spoke
the
man
coloured
with
pleasure
for
the
subordinates
of
loved
him
and
a
word
of
praise
was
almost
equal
to
promotion
it
was
on
the
advice
of
mansus
that
the
road
from
london
to
lewes
had
been
carefully
covered
and
such
streams
as
passed
beneath
that
road
had
been
searched
the
revolver
had
been
found
after
the
third
attempt
between
gatwick
and
horsley
its
identification
was
made
easier
by
the
fact
that
name
was
engraved
on
the
butt
it
was
rather
an
ornate
affair
and
in
its
earlier
days
had
been
silver
plated
the
handle
was
of
obviously
the
gift
of
one
brigand
to
another
was
t
x
comment
armed
with
this
his
task
would
have
been
fairly
easy
but
when
to
this
evidence
he
added
a
rough
draft
of
the
threatening
letter
which
he
had
found
amongst
vassalaro
belongings
and
which
had
evidently
been
taken
down
at
dictation
since
some
of
the
words
were
misspelt
and
had
been
corrected
by
another
hand
the
case
was
complete
but
what
clinched
the
matter
was
the
finding
of
a
wad
of
that
peculiar
chemical
paper
a
number
of
sheets
of
which
had
ignited
for
the
information
of
the
chief
commissioner
and
the
home
secretary
by
simply
exposing
them
for
a
few
seconds
to
the
light
of
an
electric
lamp
instantly
it
had
filled
the
home
secretary
office
with
a
pungent
and
most
disagreeable
smoke
for
which
he
was
heartily
cursed
by
his
superiors
but
it
had
rounded
off
the
argument
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
wonder
if
it
is
too
late
to
see
lexman
he
said
i
do
think
any
hour
would
be
too
late
suggested
mansus
you
shall
come
and
chaperon
me
said
his
superior
but
a
disappointment
awaited
lexman
was
not
in
and
neither
the
ringing
at
her
electric
bell
nor
vigorous
applications
to
the
knocker
brought
any
response
the
hall
porter
of
the
flats
where
she
lived
was
under
the
impression
that
lexman
had
gone
out
of
town
she
frequently
went
out
on
saturdays
and
returned
on
the
monday
and
he
thought
occasionally
on
tuesdays
it
happened
that
this
particular
night
was
a
monday
night
and
was
faced
with
a
dilemma
the
night
porter
who
had
only
the
vaguest
information
on
the
subject
thought
that
the
day
porter
might
know
more
and
aroused
him
from
his
sleep
yes
lexman
had
gone
she
went
on
the
sunday
an
unusual
day
to
pay
a
visit
and
she
had
taken
with
her
two
bags
the
porter
ventured
the
opinion
that
she
was
rather
excited
but
when
asked
to
define
the
symptoms
relapsed
into
a
chaos
of
incoherent
and
i
do
like
this
said
suddenly
does
anybody
know
that
we
have
made
these
discoveries
nobody
outside
the
office
said
mansus
unless
unless
unless
what
asked
the
other
irritably
do
be
a
jimp
mansus
get
it
off
your
mind
what
is
it
i
am
wondering
said
mansus
slowly
if
the
landlord
at
great
james
street
said
anything
he
knows
we
have
made
a
we
can
easily
find
that
out
said
x
they
hailed
a
taxi
and
drove
to
great
james
street
that
respectable
thoroughfare
was
wrapped
in
sleep
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
landlord
could
be
aroused
recognizing
he
checked
his
sarcasm
which
he
had
prepared
for
a
keyless
lodger
and
led
the
way
into
the
drawing
room
you
did
tell
me
not
to
speak
about
it
meredith
he
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
spoken
to
nobody
except
the
gentleman
who
called
the
same
what
did
he
want
asked
x
he
said
he
had
only
just
discovered
that
vassalaro
had
stayed
with
me
and
he
wanted
to
pay
whatever
rent
was
due
replied
the
other
what
like
of
man
was
he
asked
x
the
brief
description
the
man
gave
sent
a
cold
chill
to
the
commissioner
heart
kara
for
a
ducat
he
said
and
swore
long
and
variously
cadogan
square
he
ordered
his
ring
was
answered
promptly
kara
was
out
of
town
had
indeed
been
out
of
town
since
saturday
this
much
the
explained
with
a
suspicious
eye
upon
his
visitors
remembering
that
his
predecessor
had
lost
his
job
from
a
too
confiding
friendliness
with
spurious
electric
fitters
he
did
not
know
when
kara
would
return
perhaps
it
would
be
a
long
time
and
perhaps
a
short
time
he
might
come
back
that
night
or
he
might
not
you
are
wasting
your
young
life
said
bitterly
you
ought
to
be
a
fortune
this
settles
the
matter
he
said
in
the
cab
on
the
way
back
find
out
the
first
train
for
tavistock
in
the
morning
and
wire
the
george
hotel
to
have
a
car
why
not
go
suggested
the
other
there
is
the
midnight
train
it
is
rather
slow
but
it
will
get
you
there
by
six
or
seven
in
the
too
late
he
said
unless
you
can
invent
a
method
of
getting
from
here
to
paddington
in
about
fifty
the
morning
journey
to
devonshire
was
a
dispiriting
one
despite
the
fineness
of
the
day
had
an
uncomfortable
sense
that
something
distressing
had
happened
the
run
across
the
moor
in
the
fresh
spring
air
revived
him
a
little
as
they
spun
down
to
the
valley
of
the
dart
mansus
touched
his
arm
look
at
that
he
said
and
pointed
to
the
blue
heavens
where
a
mile
above
their
heads
a
aeroplane
looking
no
larger
than
a
very
distant
dragon
fly
shimmered
in
the
sunlight
by
jove
said
x
what
an
excellent
way
for
a
man
to
escape
it
about
the
only
way
said
mansus
the
significance
of
the
aeroplane
was
borne
in
upon
a
few
minutes
later
when
he
was
held
up
by
an
armed
guard
a
glance
at
his
card
was
enough
to
pass
him
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
a
prisoner
has
escaped
said
the
sentry
escaped
by
aeroplane
asked
x
i
do
know
anything
about
aeroplanes
sir
all
i
know
is
that
one
of
the
working
party
got
the
car
came
to
the
gates
of
the
prison
and
sprang
out
followed
by
his
assistant
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
governor
a
greatly
perturbed
man
for
an
escape
is
a
very
serious
matter
the
official
was
inclined
to
be
brusque
in
his
manner
but
again
the
magic
card
produced
a
soothing
effect
i
am
rather
rattled
said
the
governor
one
of
my
men
has
got
away
i
suppose
you
know
that
and
i
am
afraid
another
of
your
men
is
going
away
sir
said
who
had
a
curious
reverence
for
military
authority
he
produced
his
paper
and
laid
it
on
the
governor
table
this
is
an
order
for
the
release
of
john
lexman
convicted
under
sentence
of
fifteen
years
penal
the
governor
looked
at
it
dated
last
night
he
said
and
breathed
a
long
sigh
of
relief
thank
the
lord
that
is
the
man
who
escaped
chapter
viii
two
years
after
the
events
just
described
journeying
up
to
london
from
bath
was
attracted
by
a
paragraph
in
the
morning
post
it
told
him
briefly
that
remington
kara
the
influential
leader
of
the
greek
colony
had
been
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
dinner
of
the
hellenic
society
had
only
seen
kara
for
a
brief
space
of
time
following
that
tragic
morning
when
he
had
discovered
not
only
that
his
best
friend
had
escaped
from
dartmoor
prison
and
disappeared
as
it
were
from
the
world
at
a
moment
when
his
pardon
had
been
signed
but
that
that
friend
wife
had
also
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
at
the
same
time
it
might
as
even
admitted
have
been
the
veriest
coincidence
that
kara
had
also
cleared
out
of
london
to
reappear
at
the
end
of
six
months
any
question
addressed
to
him
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
the
two
unhappy
people
was
met
with
a
bland
expression
of
ignorance
as
to
their
whereabouts
john
lexman
was
somewhere
in
the
world
hiding
as
he
believed
from
justice
and
with
him
was
his
wife
had
no
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
this
solution
of
the
puzzle
he
had
caused
to
be
published
the
story
of
the
pardon
and
the
circumstances
under
which
that
pardon
had
been
secured
and
he
had
moreover
arranged
for
an
advertisement
to
be
inserted
in
the
principal
papers
of
every
european
country
it
was
a
moot
question
amongst
the
departmental
lawyers
as
to
whether
john
lexman
was
not
guilty
of
a
technical
and
punishable
offence
for
prison
breaking
but
this
possibility
did
not
keep
awake
at
nights
the
circumstances
of
the
escape
had
been
carefully
examined
the
warder
responsible
had
been
discharged
from
the
service
and
had
almost
immediately
purchased
for
himself
a
beer
house
in
falmouth
for
a
sum
which
left
no
doubt
in
the
official
mind
that
he
had
been
the
recipient
of
a
heavy
bribe
who
had
been
the
guiding
spirit
in
that
escape
lexman
or
kara
it
was
impossible
to
connect
kara
with
the
event
the
motor
car
had
been
traced
to
exeter
where
it
had
been
hired
by
a
gentleman
but
the
chauffeur
whoever
he
was
had
made
good
his
escape
an
inspection
of
kara
hangars
at
wembley
showed
that
his
two
monoplanes
had
not
been
removed
and
failed
entirely
to
trace
the
owner
of
the
machine
he
had
seen
flying
over
dartmoor
on
the
fatal
morning
was
somewhat
baffled
and
a
little
amused
by
the
disinclination
of
the
authorities
to
believe
that
the
escape
had
been
effected
by
this
method
at
all
all
the
events
of
the
trial
came
back
to
him
as
he
watched
the
landscape
spinning
past
he
set
down
the
newspaper
with
a
little
sigh
put
his
feet
on
the
cushions
of
the
opposite
seat
and
gave
himself
up
to
reverie
presently
he
returned
to
his
journals
and
searched
them
idly
for
something
to
interest
him
in
the
final
stretch
of
journey
between
newbury
and
paddington
presently
he
found
it
in
a
two
column
article
with
the
uninspiring
title
the
mineral
wealth
of
tierra
del
it
was
written
brightly
with
a
style
which
was
at
once
easy
and
informative
it
told
of
adventures
in
the
marshes
behind
sebastian
bay
and
journeys
up
the
guarez
celman
river
of
nights
spent
in
primeval
forests
and
ended
in
a
geological
survey
wherein
the
commercial
value
of
syenite
porphyry
trachite
and
dialite
were
severally
canvassed
the
article
was
signed
g
it
is
said
of
that
his
greatest
virtue
was
his
curiosity
he
had
at
the
tip
of
his
fingers
the
names
of
all
the
big
explorers
and
and
for
some
reason
he
could
not
place
g
to
his
satisfaction
in
fact
he
had
an
absurd
desire
to
interpret
the
initials
into
george
his
inability
to
identify
the
writer
irritated
him
and
his
first
act
on
reaching
his
office
was
to
telephone
to
one
of
the
literary
editors
of
the
times
whom
he
knew
not
my
department
was
the
chilly
reply
and
besides
we
never
give
away
the
names
of
our
contributors
speaking
as
a
person
outside
the
office
i
should
say
that
was
gathercole
the
explorer
you
know
the
fellow
who
had
an
arm
chewed
off
by
a
lion
or
george
gathercole
repeated
x
what
an
ass
i
yes
said
the
voice
at
the
other
end
the
wire
and
he
had
rung
off
before
could
think
of
something
suitable
to
say
having
elucidated
this
little
of
mystery
the
matter
passed
from
the
young
commissioner
mind
it
happened
that
morning
that
his
work
consisted
of
dealing
with
john
lexman
estate
with
the
disappearance
of
the
couple
he
had
taken
over
control
of
their
belongings
it
had
not
embarrassed
him
to
discover
that
he
was
an
executor
under
lexman
will
for
he
had
already
acted
as
trustee
to
the
wife
small
estate
and
had
been
one
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
which
john
lexman
had
made
before
his
marriage
the
estate
revenues
had
increased
very
considerably
all
the
vanished
author
books
were
selling
as
they
had
never
sold
before
and
the
executor
work
was
made
the
heavier
by
the
fact
that
grace
lexman
had
possessed
an
aunt
who
had
most
inconsiderately
died
leaving
a
considerable
fortune
to
her
unhappy
i
will
keep
the
trusteeship
another
year
he
told
the
solicitor
who
came
to
consult
him
that
morning
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
go
to
the
court
for
do
you
think
they
will
ever
turn
up
asked
the
solicitor
an
elderly
and
unimaginative
man
of
course
they
turn
up
said
impatiently
all
the
heroes
of
lexman
books
turn
up
sooner
or
later
he
will
discover
himself
to
us
at
a
suitable
moment
and
we
shall
be
properly
that
lexman
would
return
he
was
sure
it
was
a
faith
from
which
he
did
not
swerve
he
had
as
implicit
a
confidence
that
one
day
or
other
kara
the
magnificent
would
play
into
his
hands
there
were
some
queer
stories
in
circulation
concerning
the
greek
but
on
the
whole
they
were
stories
and
rumours
which
were
difficult
to
separate
from
the
malicious
gossip
which
invariably
attaches
itself
to
the
rich
and
to
the
successful
one
of
these
was
that
kara
desired
something
more
than
an
albanian
chieftainship
which
he
undoubtedly
enjoyed
there
were
whispers
of
wider
and
higher
ambitions
though
his
father
had
been
born
a
greek
he
had
indubitably
descended
in
a
direct
line
from
one
of
those
old
mprets
of
albania
who
had
exercised
their
brief
authority
over
that
turbulent
land
the
man
passion
was
for
power
to
this
end
he
did
not
spare
himself
it
was
said
that
he
utilized
his
vast
wealth
for
this
reason
and
none
other
and
that
whatever
might
have
been
the
irregularities
of
his
youth
and
there
were
adduced
concrete
instances
he
was
working
toward
an
end
with
a
singleness
of
purpose
from
which
it
was
difficult
to
withhold
admiration
kept
in
his
locked
desk
a
little
red
book
steel
bound
and
triple
locked
which
he
called
his
in
this
he
inscribed
in
his
own
irregular
writing
the
titbits
which
might
not
be
published
and
which
often
helped
an
investigator
to
light
upon
the
missing
threads
of
a
problem
in
truth
he
scorned
no
source
of
information
and
was
conscienceless
in
the
compilation
of
this
somewhat
chaotic
record
the
affairs
of
john
lexman
recalled
kara
and
kara
great
reception
mansus
would
have
made
arrangements
to
secure
a
verbatim
report
of
the
speeches
which
were
made
and
these
would
be
in
his
hands
by
the
night
mansus
did
not
tell
him
that
kara
was
financing
some
very
influential
people
indeed
that
a
certain
of
state
with
a
great
number
of
very
influential
relations
had
been
saved
from
bankruptcy
by
the
timely
advances
which
kara
had
made
this
had
obtained
through
sources
which
might
be
hastily
described
as
discreditable
mansus
knew
of
the
baccarat
establishment
in
albemarle
street
but
he
did
not
know
that
the
neurotic
wife
of
a
very
great
man
indeed
no
less
than
the
minister
of
justice
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
that
establishment
and
that
she
had
lost
in
one
night
some
pounds
in
these
circumstances
it
was
remarkable
thought
that
she
should
report
to
the
police
so
small
a
matter
as
the
petty
pilfering
of
servants
this
however
she
had
done
and
whilst
the
lesser
officers
of
scotland
yard
were
interrogating
pawnbrokers
the
men
higher
up
were
genuinely
worried
by
the
lady
own
lapses
from
grace
it
was
all
sordid
but
unfortunately
conventional
because
highly
placed
people
will
always
do
underbred
things
where
money
or
women
are
concerned
but
it
was
necessary
for
the
proper
conduct
of
the
department
which
directed
that
however
sordid
and
however
conventional
might
be
the
errors
which
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
committed
they
should
be
filed
for
reference
the
motto
which
went
upon
in
life
was
you
never
the
minister
of
justice
was
a
very
important
person
for
he
was
a
personal
friend
of
half
the
monarchs
of
europe
a
poor
man
with
two
or
three
thousand
a
year
of
his
own
with
no
very
definite
political
views
and
uncommitted
to
the
more
violent
policies
of
either
party
he
succeeded
in
serving
both
with
profit
to
himself
and
without
earning
the
obloquy
of
either
though
he
did
not
pursue
the
blatant
policy
of
the
vicar
of
bray
yet
it
is
fact
which
may
be
confirmed
from
the
reader
own
knowledge
that
he
served
in
four
different
administrations
drawing
the
pay
and
emoluments
of
his
office
from
each
though
the
fundamental
policies
of
those
four
governments
were
distinct
lady
bartholomew
the
wife
of
this
adaptable
minister
had
recently
departed
for
san
remo
the
newspapers
announced
the
fact
and
spoke
vaguely
of
a
breakdown
which
prevented
the
lady
from
fulfilling
her
social
engagements
ever
a
doubting
thomas
could
trace
no
visit
of
nerve
specialist
nor
yet
of
the
family
practitioner
to
the
official
residence
in
downing
street
and
therefore
he
drew
conclusions
in
his
own
who
who
noted
the
hobbies
of
his
victims
which
by
the
way
did
not
always
coincide
with
the
innocent
occupations

against
their
names
in
the
more
pretentious
volume
their
follies
and
their
weaknesses

a
place

were
recorded
at
a
length

it
might
seem

that
she
was
the
seventh
daughter
of
the
earl
of
balmorey
that
she
had
one
daughter
who
rejoiced
in
the
somewhat
unpromising
name
of
belinda
mary
and
such
further
information
as
a
man
might
get
without
going
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
refreshing
his
memory
from
the
little
red
book
wondered
what
unexpected
tragedy
had
sent
lady
bartholomew
out
of
london
in
the
middle
of
the
season
the
information
was
that
the
lady
was
fairly
well
off
at
this
moment
and
this
fact
made
matters
all
the
more
puzzling
and
almost
induced
him
to
believe
that
after
all
the
story
was
true
and
a
nervous
breakdown
really
was
the
cause
of
her
sudden
departure
he
sent
for
mansus
you
saw
lady
bartholomew
off
at
charing
cross
i
suppose
mansus
nodded
she
went
alone
she
took
her
maid
but
otherwise
she
was
alone
i
thought
she
looked
she
has
been
looking
ill
for
months
past
said
without
any
visible
expression
of
sympathy
did
she
take
belinda
mary
mansus
was
puzzled
belinda
mary
he
repeated
slowly
oh
you
mean
the
daughter
no
she
at
a
school
somewhere
in
whistled
a
snatch
of
a
popular
song
closed
the
little
red
book
with
a
snap
and
replaced
it
in
his
desk
i
wonder
where
on
earth
people
dig
up
names
like
belinda
mary
he
mused
belinda
mary
must
be
rather
a
weird
little
animal
the
lord
forgive
me
for
speaking
so
about
my
betters
if
heredity
counts
for
anything
she
ought
to
be
something
between
a
head
waiter
and
a
pack
of
cards
have
you
lost
anything
mansus
was
searching
his
pockets
i
made
a
few
notes
some
questions
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
and
lady
bartholomew
was
the
subject
of
one
of
them
i
have
had
her
under
observation
for
six
months
do
you
want
it
kept
up
thought
awhile
then
shook
his
head
i
am
only
interested
in
lady
bartholomew
in
so
far
as
kara
is
interested
in
her
there
is
a
criminal
for
you
my
friend
he
added
admiringly
mansus
busily
engaged
in
going
through
the
bundles
of
letters
slips
of
paper
and
little
notebooks
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
sniffed
audibly
have
you
a
cold
asked
politely
no
sir
was
the
reply
only
i
have
much
opinion
of
kara
as
a
criminal
besides
what
has
he
got
to
be
a
criminal
about
he
has
all
that
he
requires
in
the
money
department
he
one
of
the
most
popular
people
in
london
and
certainly
one
of
the
men
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
he
needs
regarded
him
scornfully
you
a
poor
blind
brute
he
said
shaking
his
head
do
you
know
that
great
criminals
are
never
influenced
by
material
desires
or
by
the
prospect
of
concrete
gains
the
man
who
robs
his
employer
till
in
order
to
give
the
girl
of
his
heart
the
and
ruby
brooch
her
soul
desires
gains
nothing
but
the
glow
of
satisfaction
which
comes
to
the
man
who
is
thought
well
of
the
majority
of
crimes
in
the
world
are
committed
by
people
for
the
same
reason
they
want
to
be
thought
well
of
here
is
doctor
who
murdered
his
wife
because
she
was
a
drunkard
and
a
slut
and
he
dared
not
leave
her
for
fear
the
neighbours
would
have
doubts
as
to
his
respectability
here
is
another
gentleman
who
murders
his
wives
in
their
baths
in
order
that
he
should
keep
up
some
sort
of
position
and
earn
the
respect
of
his
friends
and
his
associates
nothing
roused
him
more
quickly
to
a
frenzy
of
passion
than
the
suggestion
that
he
was
not
respectable
here
is
the
great
financier
who
has
embezzled
a
million
and
a
quarter
not
because
he
needed
money
but
because
people
looked
up
to
him
therefore
he
must
build
great
mansions
submarine
pleasure
courts
and
must
lay
out
huge
estates
because
he
wished
that
he
should
be
thought
well
of
mansus
sniffed
again
what
about
the
man
who
half
murders
his
wife
does
he
do
that
to
be
well
thought
of
he
asked
with
a
tinge
of
sarcasm
looked
at
him
pityingly
the
who
beats
his
wife
my
poor
mansus
he
said
does
so
because
she
does
think
well
of
him
that
is
our
ruling
passion
our
national
characteristic
the
primary
cause
of
most
crimes
big
or
little
that
is
why
kara
is
a
bad
criminal
and
will
as
i
say
end
his
life
very
he
took
down
his
glossy
silk
hat
from
the
peg
and
slipped
into
his
overcoat
i
am
going
down
to
see
my
friend
kara
he
said
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
talk
with
him
he
might
tell
me
his
acquaintance
with
kara
menage
had
been
mere
hearsay
he
had
interviewed
the
greek
once
after
his
return
but
since
all
his
efforts
to
secure
information
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
john
lexman
and
his
wife
the
main
reason
for
his
visit
had
been
in
vain
he
had
not
repeated
his
visit
the
house
in
cadogan
square
was
a
large
one
occupying
a
corner
site
it
was
peculiarly
english
in
appearance
with
its
window
boxes
its
discreet
curtains
its
polished
brass
and
enamelled
doorway
it
had
been
the
town
house
of
lord
henry
gratham
that
eccentric
connoisseur
of
wine
and
follower
of
witless
pleasure
it
had
been
built
by
him
round
a
bottle
of
port
as
his
friends
said
meaning
thereby
that
his
first
consideration
had
been
the
cellarage
of
the
house
and
that
when
those
cellars
had
been
built
and
provision
made
for
the
safe
storage
of
his
priceless
wines
the
house
had
been
built
without
the
architect
being
greatly
troubled
by
his
lordship
the
double
cellars
of
gratham
house
had
in
their
time
been
one
of
the
sights
of
london
when
henry
gratham
lay
under
eight
feet
of
congo
earth
he
was
killed
by
an
elephant
whilst
on
a
hunting
trip
his
executors
had
been
singularly
fortunate
in
finding
an
immediate
purchaser
rumour
had
it
that
kara
who
was
no
lover
of
wine
had
bricked
up
the
cellars
and
their
very
existence
passed
into
domestic
legendary
the
door
was
opened
by
a
and
deferential
and
was
ushered
into
the
hall
a
fire
burnt
cheerily
in
a
bronze
grate
and
had
a
glimpse
of
a
big
oil
painting
of
kara
above
the
marble
mr
kara
is
very
busy
sir
said
the
man
just
take
in
my
card
said
x
i
think
he
may
care
to
see
the
man
bowed
produced
from
some
mysterious
corner
a
silver
salver
and
glided
upstairs
in
that
manner
which
servants
have
a
manner
which
seems
to
call
for
no
bodily
effort
in
a
minute
he
returned
will
you
come
this
way
sir
he
said
and
led
the
way
up
a
broad
flight
of
stairs
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
a
corridor
which
ran
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
from
this
there
gave
four
rooms
one
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
passage
on
the
right
one
on
the
left
and
two
at
fairly
regular
intervals
in
the
centre
when
the
man
hand
was
on
one
of
the
doors
asked
quietly
i
think
i
have
seen
you
before
somewhere
my
the
man
smiled
it
is
very
possible
sir
i
was
a
waiter
at
the
constitutional
for
some
nodded
that
is
where
it
must
have
been
he
said
the
man
opened
the
door
and
announced
the
visitor
found
himself
in
a
large
room
very
handsomely
furnished
but
just
lacking
that
sense
of
cosiness
and
comfort
which
is
the
feature
of
the
englishman
home
kara
rose
from
behind
a
big
writing
table
and
came
with
a
smile
and
a
quick
step
to
greet
the
visitor
this
is
a
most
unexpected
pleasure
he
said
and
shook
hands
warmly
had
not
seen
him
for
a
year
and
found
very
little
change
in
this
strange
young
man
he
could
not
be
more
confident
than
he
had
been
nor
bear
himself
with
a
more
graceful
carriage
whatever
social
success
he
had
achieved
it
had
not
spoiled
him
for
his
manner
was
as
genial
and
easy
as
ever
i
think
that
will
do
miss
holland
he
said
turning
to
the
girl
who
with
notebook
in
hand
stood
by
the
desk
evidently
thought
our
hellenic
friend
has
a
pretty
taste
in
in
that
one
glance
he
took
her
all
in
from
the
of
her
hair
to
her
neat
foot
was
not
readily
attracted
by
members
of
the
opposite
sex
he
was
a
predestined
bachelor
finding
life
and
its
incidence
too
absorbing
to
give
his
whole
mind
to
the
serious
problem
of
marriage
or
to
contract
responsibilities
and
interests
which
might
divert
his
attention
from
what
he
believed
was
the
greater
game
yet
he
must
be
a
man
of
stone
to
resist
the
freshness
the
beauty
and
the
youth
of
this
straight
slender
girl
the
of
her
the
aliveness
and
buoyancy
and
the
thrilling
sense
of
vitality
she
carried
in
her
very
presence
what
is
the
weirdest
name
you
have
ever
heard
asked
kara
laughingly
i
ask
you
because
miss
holland
and
i
have
been
discussing
a
begging
letter
addressed
to
us
by
a
maggie
the
girl
smiled
slightly
and
in
that
smile
was
paradise
thought
x
the
weirdest
name
he
repeated
why
i
think
the
worst
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
is
belinda
that
has
a
familiar
ring
said
kara
was
looking
at
the
girl
she
was
staring
at
him
with
a
certain
languid
insolence
which
made
him
curl
up
inside
then
with
a
glance
at
her
employer
she
swept
from
the
room
i
ought
to
have
introduced
you
said
kara
that
was
my
secretary
miss
holland
rather
a
pretty
girl
is
she
very
said
recovering
his
breath
i
like
pretty
things
around
me
said
kara
and
somehow
the
complacency
of
the
remark
annoyed
the
detective
more
than
anything
that
kara
had
ever
said
to
him
the
greek
went
to
the
mantlepiece
and
taking
down
a
silver
cigarette
box
opened
and
offered
it
to
his
visitor
kara
was
wearing
a
grey
lounge
suit
and
although
grey
is
a
very
trying
colour
for
a
foreigner
to
wear
this
suit
fitted
his
splendid
figure
and
gave
him
just
that
bulk
which
he
needed
you
are
a
most
suspicious
man
meredith
he
smiled
suspicious
i
asked
the
innocent
kara
nodded
i
am
sure
you
want
to
enquire
into
the
character
of
all
my
present
staff
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
that
you
will
never
be
at
rest
until
you
learn
the
antecedents
of
my
cook
my
valet
my
secretary
held
up
his
hand
with
a
laugh
spare
me
he
said
it
is
one
of
my
failings
i
admit
but
i
have
never
gone
much
farther
into
your
domestic
affairs
than
to
pry
into
the
antecedents
of
your
very
interesting
a
little
cloud
passed
over
kara
face
but
it
was
only
momentary
oh
brown
he
said
airily
with
just
a
perceptible
pause
between
the
two
words
it
used
to
be
smith
said
but
no
matter
his
name
is
really
oh
poropulos
said
kara
gravely
i
dismissed
him
a
long
time
pensioned
hire
too
i
understand
said
x
the
other
looked
at
him
awhile
then
i
am
very
good
to
my
old
servants
he
said
slowly
and
changing
the
subject
to
what
good
fortune
do
i
owe
this
visit
selected
a
cigarette
before
he
replied
i
thought
you
might
be
of
some
service
to
me
he
said
apparently
giving
his
whole
attention
to
the
cigarette
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
said
kara
a
little
eagerly
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
been
very
keen
on
continuing
what
i
hoped
would
have
ripened
into
a
valuable
friendship
more
valuable
to
me
perhaps
he
smiled
than
to
i
am
a
very
shy
man
said
the
shameless
difficult
to
a
fault
and
rather
apt
to
underrate
my
social
attractions
i
have
come
to
you
now
because
you
know
everybody
by
the
way
how
long
have
you
had
your
secretary
he
asked
abruptly
kara
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
for
inspiration
four
no
three
months
he
corrected
a
very
efficient
young
lady
who
came
to
me
from
one
of
the
training
establishments
somewhat
uncommunicative
better
educated
than
most
girls
in
her
position
for
example
she
speaks
and
writes
modern
greek
fairly
a
treasure
suggested
x
unusually
so
said
kara
she
lives
in
marylebone
road
is
the
address
she
has
no
friends
spends
most
of
her
evenings
in
her
room
is
eminently
respectable
and
a
little
chilling
in
her
attitude
to
her
shot
a
swift
glance
at
the
other
why
do
you
tell
me
all
this
he
asked
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
finding
out
replied
the
other
coolly
that
insatiable
curiosity
which
is
one
of
the
equipments
of
your
profession
would
i
feel
sure
induce
you
to
conduct
investigations
for
your
own
laughed
may
i
sit
down
he
said
the
other
wheeled
an
armchair
across
the
room
and
sank
into
it
he
leant
back
and
crossed
his
legs
and
was
in
a
second
the
personification
of
ease
i
think
you
are
a
very
clever
man
monsieur
kara
he
said
the
other
looked
down
at
him
this
time
without
amusement
not
so
clever
that
i
can
discover
the
object
of
your
visit
he
said
pleasantly
enough
it
is
very
simply
explained
said
x
you
know
everybody
in
town
you
know
amongst
other
people
lady
i
know
the
lady
very
well
indeed
said
kara
readily
too
readily
in
fact
for
the
rapidity
with
which
answer
had
followed
question
suggested
to
that
kara
had
anticipated
the
reason
for
the
call
have
you
any
idea
asked
speaking
with
deliberation
as
to
why
lady
bartholomew
has
gone
out
of
town
at
this
particular
moment
kara
laughed
what
an
extraordinary
question
to
ask
me
as
though
lady
bartholomew
confided
her
plans
to
one
who
is
little
more
than
a
chance
acquaintance
and
yet
said
contemplating
the
burning
end
of
his
cigarette
you
know
her
well
enough
to
hold
her
promissory
promissory
note
asked
the
other
his
tone
was
one
of
involuntary
surprise
and
swore
softly
to
himself
for
now
he
saw
the
faintest
shade
of
relief
in
kara
face
the
commissioner
realized
that
he
had
committed
an
error
he
had
been
far
too
definite
when
i
say
promissory
note
he
went
on
easily
as
though
he
had
noticed
nothing
i
mean
of
course
the
securities
which
the
debtor
invariably
gives
to
one
from
whom
he
or
she
has
borrowed
large
sums
of
kara
made
no
answer
but
opening
a
drawer
of
his
desk
he
took
out
a
key
and
brought
it
across
to
where
was
sitting
here
is
the
key
of
my
safe
he
said
quietly
you
are
at
liberty
to
go
carefully
through
its
contents
and
discover
for
yourself
any
promissory
note
which
i
hold
from
lady
bartholomew
my
dear
fellow
you
imagine
i
a
moneylender
do
you
he
said
in
an
injured
tone
nothing
was
further
from
my
thoughts
said
untruthfully
but
the
other
pressed
the
key
upon
him
i
should
be
awfully
glad
if
you
would
look
for
yourself
he
said
earnestly
i
feel
that
in
some
way
you
associate
lady
illness
with
some
horrible
act
of
usury
on
my
part
will
you
satisfy
yourself
and
in
doing
so
satisfy
me
now
any
ordinary
man
and
possibly
any
ordinary
detective
would
have
made
the
conventional
answer
he
would
have
protested
that
he
had
no
intention
of
doing
anything
of
the
sort
he
would
have
uttered
if
he
were
a
man
in
the
position
which
occupied
the
conventional
statement
that
he
had
no
authority
to
search
the
private
papers
and
that
he
would
certainly
not
avail
himself
of
the
other
kindness
but
was
not
an
ordinary
person
he
took
the
key
and
balanced
it
lightly
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
is
this
the
key
of
the
famous
bedroom
safe
he
said
banteringly
kara
was
looking
down
at
him
with
a
quizzical
smile
it
is
the
safe
you
opened
in
my
absence
on
one
memorable
occasion
meredith
he
said
as
you
probably
know
i
have
changed
that
safe
but
perhaps
you
do
feel
equal
to
the
task
on
the
contrary
said
calmly
and
rising
from
the
chair
i
am
going
to
put
your
good
faith
to
the
for
answer
kara
walked
to
the
door
and
opened
it
let
me
show
you
the
way
he
said
politely
he
passed
along
the
corridor
and
entered
the
apartment
at
the
end
the
room
was
a
large
one
and
lighted
by
one
big
square
window
which
was
protected
by
steel
bars
in
the
grate
which
was
broad
and
high
a
huge
fire
was
burning
and
the
temperature
of
the
room
was
unpleasantly
close
despite
the
coldness
of
the
day
that
is
one
of
the
eccentricities
which
you
as
an
englishman
will
never
excuse
in
me
said
kara
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
let
into
and
flush
with
the
wall
was
a
big
green
door
of
the
safe
here
you
are
meredith
said
kara
all
the
precious
secrets
of
remington
kara
are
yours
for
the
i
am
afraid
i
had
my
trouble
for
nothing
said
making
no
attempt
to
use
the
key
that
is
an
opinion
which
i
share
said
kara
with
a
smile
curiously
enough
said
x
i
mean
just
what
you
he
handed
the
key
to
kara
wo
you
open
it
asked
the
greek
shook
his
head
the
safe
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
a
magnus
the
key
which
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
give
me
is
legibly
inscribed
upon
the
handle
my
experience
as
a
police
officer
has
taught
me
that
chubb
keys
very
rarely
open
magnus
kara
uttered
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
how
stupid
of
me
he
said
yet
now
i
remember
i
sent
the
key
to
my
bankers
before
i
went
out
of
town
i
only
came
back
this
morning
you
know
i
will
send
for
it
at
pray
do
trouble
murmured
politely
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
little
flat
leather
case
and
opened
it
it
contained
a
number
of
steel
implements
of
curious
shape
which
were
held
in
position
by
a
leather
loop
along
the
centre
of
the
case
from
one
of
these
loops
he
extracted
a
handle
and
deftly
fitted
something
that
looked
like
a
steel
awl
to
the
socket
in
the
handle
looking
in
wonder
and
with
no
little
apprehension
kara
saw
that
the
awl
was
bent
at
the
head
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
a
little
alarmed
i
show
you
said
pleasantly
very
gingerly
he
inserted
the
instrument
in
the
small
keyhole
and
turned
it
cautiously
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
there
was
a
sharp
click
followed
by
another
he
turned
the
handle
and
the
door
of
the
safe
swung
open
simple
is
it
he
asked
politely
in
that
second
of
time
kara
face
had
undergone
a
transformation
the
eyes
which
met
meredith
blazed
with
an
almost
insane
fury
with
a
quick
stride
kara
placed
himself
before
the
open
safe
i
think
this
has
gone
far
enough
meredith
he
said
harshly
if
you
wish
to
search
my
safe
you
must
get
a
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
carefully
unscrewing
the
instrument
he
had
employed
and
replacing
it
in
the
case
he
returned
it
to
his
inside
pocket
it
was
at
your
invitation
my
dear
monsieur
kara
he
said
suavely
of
course
i
knew
that
you
were
putting
a
bluff
up
on
me
with
the
key
and
that
you
had
no
more
intention
of
letting
me
see
the
inside
of
your
safe
than
you
had
of
telling
me
exactly
what
happened
to
john
the
shot
went
home
the
face
which
was
thrust
into
the
commissioner
was
ridged
and
veined
with
passion
the
lips
were
turned
back
to
show
the
big
white
even
teeth
the
eyes
were
narrowed
to
slits
the
jaw
thrust
out
and
almost
every
semblance
of
humanity
had
vanished
from
his
face
you
you
he
hissed
and
his
clawing
hands
moved
suspiciously
backward
put
up
your
hands
said
sharply
and
be
damned
quick
about
it
in
a
flash
the
hands
went
up
for
the
revolver
which
held
was
pressed
uncomfortably
against
the
third
button
of
the
greek
waistcoat
that
not
the
first
time
you
been
asked
to
put
up
your
hands
i
think
said
pleasantly
his
own
left
hand
slipped
round
to
kara
hip
pocket
he
found
something
in
the
shape
of
a
cylinder
and
drew
it
out
from
the
pocket
to
his
surprise
it
was
not
a
revolver
not
even
a
knife
it
looked
like
a
small
electric
torch
though
instead
of
a
bulb
and
a
glass
there
was
a
perforation
at
one
end
he
handled
it
carefully
and
was
about
to
press
the
small
nickel
knob
when
a
strangled
cry
of
horror
broke
from
kara
for
god
sake
be
careful
he
gasped
you
pointing
it
at
me
do
not
press
that
lever
i
beg
will
it
explode
asked
curiously
no
no
pointed
the
thing
downward
to
the
carpet
and
pressed
the
knob
cautiously
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
sharp
hiss
and
the
floor
was
stained
with
the
liquid
which
the
instrument
contained
just
one
gush
of
fluid
and
no
more
looked
down
the
bright
carpet
had
already
changed
colour
and
was
smoking
the
room
was
filled
with
a
pungent
and
disagreeable
scent
looked
from
the
floor
to
the
man
vitriol
i
believe
he
said
shaking
his
head
admiringly
what
a
dear
little
fellow
you
are
the
man
big
as
he
was
was
on
the
point
of
collapse
and
mumbled
something
about
and
listened
without
a
word
whilst
labouring
under
an
emotion
which
was
perfectly
pardonable
described
kara
his
ancestors
and
the
possibilities
of
his
future
estate
very
slowly
the
greek
recovered
his
i
did
intend
using
it
on
you
i
swear
i
did
he
pleaded
i
surrounded
by
enemies
meredith
i
had
to
carry
some
means
of
protection
it
is
because
my
enemies
know
i
carry
this
that
they
fight
shy
of
me
i
swear
i
had
no
intention
of
using
it
on
you
the
idea
is
too
preposterous
i
am
sorry
i
fooled
you
about
the
do
let
that
worry
you
said
x
i
am
afraid
i
did
all
the
fooling
no
i
can
not
let
you
have
this
back
again
he
said
as
the
greek
put
out
his
hand
to
take
the
infernal
little
instrument
i
must
take
this
back
to
scotland
yard
it
quite
a
long
time
since
we
had
anything
new
in
this
shape
compressed
air
i
kara
nodded
solemnly
very
ingenious
indeed
said
x
if
i
had
a
brain
like
yours
he
paused
i
should
do
something
with
it
with
a
gun
he
added
as
he
passed
out
of
the
room
chapter
ix
my
dear
meredith
i
can
not
tell
you
how
unhappy
and
humiliated
i
feel
that
my
little
joke
with
you
should
have
had
such
an
uncomfortable
ending
as
you
know
and
as
i
have
given
you
proof
i
have
the
greatest
admiration
in
the
world
for
one
whose
work
for
humanity
has
won
such
universal
recognition
i
hope
that
we
shall
both
forget
this
unhappy
morning
and
that
you
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
rendering
to
you
in
person
the
apologies
which
are
due
to
you
i
feel
that
anything
less
will
neither
rehabilitate
me
in
your
esteem
nor
secure
for
me
the
remnants
of
my
shattered
i
am
hoping
you
will
dine
with
me
next
week
and
meet
a
most
interesting
man
george
gathercole
who
has
just
returned
from
patagonia
i
only
received
his
letter
this
morning
having
made
most
remarkable
discoveries
concerning
that
country
i
feel
sure
that
you
are
large
enough
minded
and
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
allow
my
foolish
fit
of
temper
to
disturb
a
relationship
which
i
have
always
hoped
would
be
mutually
pleasant
if
you
will
allow
gathercole
who
will
be
unconscious
of
the
part
he
is
playing
to
act
as
peacemaker
between
yourself
and
myself
i
shall
feel
that
his
trip
which
has
cost
me
a
large
sum
of
money
will
not
have
been
wasted
i
am
dear
meredith
yours
very
sincerely
remington
kara
folded
the
letter
and
inserted
it
in
its
envelope
he
rang
a
bell
on
his
table
and
the
girl
who
had
so
filled
with
a
sense
of
awe
came
from
an
adjoining
room
you
will
see
that
this
is
delivered
miss
she
inclined
her
head
and
stood
waiting
kara
rose
from
his
desk
and
began
to
pace
the
room
do
you
know
meredith
he
asked
suddenly
i
have
heard
of
him
said
the
girl
a
man
with
a
singular
mind
said
kara
a
man
against
whom
my
favourite
weapon
would
she
looked
at
him
with
interest
in
her
eyes
what
is
your
favourite
weapon
kara
she
asked
fear
he
said
if
he
expected
her
to
give
him
any
encouragement
to
proceed
he
was
disappointed
probably
he
required
no
such
encouragement
for
in
the
presence
of
his
social
inferiors
he
was
somewhat
monopolizing
cut
a
man
flesh
and
it
heals
he
said
whip
a
man
and
the
memory
of
it
passes
frighten
him
fill
him
with
a
sense
of
foreboding
and
apprehension
and
let
him
believe
that
something
dreadful
is
going
to
happen
either
to
himself
or
to
someone
he
loves
better
the
latter
and
you
will
hurt
him
beyond
forgetfulness
fear
is
a
tyrant
and
a
despot
more
terrible
than
the
rack
more
potent
than
the
stake
fear
is
and
sees
horrors
where
normal
vision
only
sees
the
is
that
your
creed
she
asked
quietly
part
of
it
miss
holland
he
smiled
she
played
idly
with
the
letter
she
held
in
her
hand
balancing
it
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
her
eyes
downcast
what
would
justify
the
use
of
such
an
awful
weapon
she
asked
it
is
amply
justified
to
secure
an
end
he
said
blandly
for
example
i
want
something
i
can
not
obtain
that
something
through
the
ordinary
channel
or
by
the
employment
of
ordinary
means
it
is
essential
to
me
to
my
happiness
to
my
comfort
or
my
that
that
something
shall
be
possessed
by
me
if
i
can
buy
it
well
and
good
if
i
can
buy
those
who
can
use
their
influence
to
secure
this
thing
for
me
so
much
the
better
if
i
can
obtain
it
by
any
merit
i
possess
i
utilize
that
merit
providing
always
that
i
can
secure
my
object
in
the
time
otherwise
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
see
she
said
nodding
her
head
quickly
i
suppose
that
is
how
blackmailers
he
frowned
that
is
a
word
i
never
use
nor
do
i
like
to
hear
it
employed
he
said
blackmail
suggests
to
me
a
vulgar
attempt
to
obtain
which
is
generally
very
badly
wanted
by
the
people
who
use
it
said
the
girl
with
a
little
smile
and
according
to
your
argument
they
are
also
it
is
a
matter
of
plane
he
said
airily
viewed
from
my
standpoint
they
are
sordid
criminals
the
sort
of
person
that
meets
i
presume
in
the
course
of
his
daily
work
he
went
on
somewhat
oracularly
is
a
man
for
whom
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
you
will
probably
meet
him
again
for
he
will
find
an
opportunity
of
asking
you
a
few
questions
about
myself
i
need
hardly
tell
you
he
lifted
his
shoulders
with
a
deprecating
smile
i
shall
certainly
not
discuss
your
business
with
any
person
said
the
girl
coldly
i
am
paying
you
pounds
a
week
i
think
he
said
i
intend
increasing
that
to
pounds
because
you
suit
me
most
thank
you
said
the
girl
quietly
but
i
am
already
being
paid
quite
she
left
him
a
little
astonished
and
not
a
little
ruffled
to
refuse
the
favours
of
remington
kara
was
by
him
regarded
as
something
of
an
affront
half
his
quarrel
with
was
that
gentleman
curious
indifference
to
the
benevolent
attitude
which
kara
had
persistently
adopted
in
his
dealings
with
the
detective
he
rang
the
bell
this
time
for
his
valet
fisher
he
said
i
am
expecting
a
visit
from
a
gentleman
named
gathercole
a
gentleman
whom
you
must
look
after
if
he
comes
detain
him
on
some
pretext
or
other
because
he
is
rather
difficult
to
get
hold
of
and
i
want
to
see
him
i
am
going
out
now
and
i
shall
be
back
at
do
whatever
you
can
to
prevent
him
going
away
until
i
return
he
will
probably
be
interested
if
you
take
him
into
the
very
good
sir
said
the
urbane
fisher
will
you
change
before
you
go
out
kara
shook
his
head
i
think
i
will
go
as
i
am
he
said
get
me
my
fur
coat
this
beastly
cold
kills
me
he
shivered
as
he
glanced
into
the
bleak
street
keep
my
fire
going
put
all
my
private
letters
in
my
bedroom
and
see
that
miss
holland
has
her
fisher
followed
him
to
his
car
wrapped
the
fur
rug
about
his
legs
closed
the
door
carefully
and
returned
to
the
house
from
thence
onward
his
behaviour
was
somewhat
extraordinary
for
a
servant
that
he
should
return
to
kara
study
and
set
the
papers
in
order
was
natural
and
proper
that
he
should
conduct
a
rapid
examination
of
all
the
drawers
in
desk
might
be
excused
on
the
score
of
diligence
since
he
was
to
some
extent
in
the
confidence
of
his
employer
kara
was
given
to
making
friends
of
his
servants
up
to
a
point
in
his
more
generous
moments
he
would
address
his
bodyguard
as
fred
and
on
more
occasions
than
one
and
for
no
apparent
reason
had
tipped
his
servant
over
and
above
his
salary
fred
fisher
found
little
to
reward
him
for
his
search
until
he
came
upon
kara
cheque
book
which
told
him
that
on
the
previous
day
the
greek
had
drawn
pounds
in
cash
from
the
bank
this
interested
him
mightily
and
he
replaced
the
cheque
book
with
the
tightened
lips
and
the
fixed
gaze
of
a
man
who
was
thinking
rapidly
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
library
where
the
secretary
was
engaged
in
making
copies
of
correspondence
answering
letters
appealing
for
charitable
donations
and
in
the
hack
words
which
fall
to
the
secretaries
of
the
great
he
replenished
the
fire
asked
deferentially
for
any
instructions
and
returned
again
to
his
quest
this
time
he
made
the
bedroom
the
scene
of
his
investigations
the
safe
he
did
not
attempt
to
touch
but
there
was
a
small
bureau
in
which
kara
would
have
placed
his
private
correspondence
of
the
morning
this
however
yielded
no
result
by
the
side
of
the
bed
on
a
small
table
was
a
telephone
the
sight
of
which
apparently
afforded
the
servant
a
little
amusement
this
was
the
private
which
kara
had
been
instrumental
in
having
fixed
to
scotland
yard
as
he
had
explained
to
his
servants
rum
cove
said
fisher
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
closed
door
of
the
room
and
smilingly
surveyed
the
great
steel
latch
which
spanned
the
door
and
fitted
into
an
iron
socket
securely
screwed
to
the
framework
he
lifted
it
gingerly
there
was
a
little
knob
for
the
purpose
and
let
it
fall
gently
into
the
socket
which
had
been
made
to
receive
it
on
the
door
itself
rum
cove
he
said
again
and
lifting
the
latch
to
the
hook
which
held
it
up
left
the
room
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
he
walked
down
the
corridor
with
a
meditative
frown
and
began
to
descend
the
stairs
to
the
hall
he
was
less
than
down
when
the
one
maid
of
kara
household
came
up
to
meet
him
there
a
gentleman
who
wants
to
see
kara
she
said
here
is
his
fisher
took
the
card
from
the
salver
and
read
mr
george
gathercole
junior
travellers
i
see
this
gentleman
he
said
with
a
sudden
brisk
interest
he
found
the
visitor
standing
in
the
hall
he
was
a
man
who
would
have
attracted
attention
if
only
from
the
somewhat
eccentric
nature
of
his
dress
and
his
unkempt
appearance
he
was
dressed
in
a
overcoat
of
a
somewhat
pronounced
check
he
had
a
glossy
and
obviously
new
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
covered
by
a
ragged
beard
this
he
was
plucking
with
nervous
jerks
talking
to
himself
the
while
and
casting
a
disparaging
eye
upon
the
portrait
of
remington
kara
which
hung
above
the
marble
fireplace
a
pair
of
sat
crookedly
on
his
nose
and
two
fat
volumes
under
his
arm
completed
the
picture
fisher
who
was
an
observer
of
some
discernment
noticed
under
the
overcoat
a
creased
blue
suit
large
black
boots
and
a
pair
of
pearl
studs
the
newcomer
glared
round
at
the
valet
take
these
he
ordered
peremptorily
pointing
to
the
books
under
his
arm
fisher
hastened
to
obey
and
noted
with
some
wonder
that
the
visitor
did
not
attempt
to
assist
him
either
by
loosening
his
hold
of
the
volumes
or
raising
his
hand
accidentally
the
valet
hand
pressed
against
the
other
sleeve
and
he
received
a
shock
for
the
forearm
was
clearly
an
artificial
one
it
was
against
a
wooden
surface
beneath
the
sleeve
that
his
knuckles
struck
and
this
view
of
the
stranger
infirmity
was
confirmed
when
the
other
reached
round
with
his
right
hand
took
hold
of
the
gloved
left
hand
and
thrust
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
where
is
kara
growled
the
stranger
he
will
be
back
very
shortly
sir
said
the
urbane
fisher
out
is
he
boomed
the
visitor
then
i
sha
wait
what
the
devil
does
he
mean
by
being
out
he
had
three
years
to
be
out
mr
kara
expects
you
sir
he
told
me
he
would
be
in
at
six
at
the
six
ye
stormed
the
man
impatiently
what
dog
am
i
that
i
should
wait
till
six
he
gave
a
savage
little
tug
at
his
beard
six
eh
you
will
tell
kara
that
i
called
give
me
those
but
i
assure
you
sir
stammered
fisher
give
me
those
books
roared
the
other
deftly
he
lifted
his
left
hand
from
the
pocket
crooked
the
elbow
by
some
quick
manipulation
and
thrust
the
books
which
the
valet
most
reluctantly
handed
to
him
back
to
the
place
from
whence
he
had
taken
them
tell
kara
i
will
call
at
my
own
time
do
you
understand
at
my
own
time
good
morning
to
if
you
would
only
wait
sir
pleaded
the
agonized
fisher
wait
be
hanged
snarled
the
other
i
waited
three
years
i
tell
you
tell
kara
to
expect
me
when
he
sees
me
he
went
out
and
most
unnecessarily
banged
the
door
behind
him
fisher
went
back
to
the
library
the
girl
was
sealing
up
some
letters
as
he
entered
and
looked
up
i
am
afraid
miss
holland
i
got
myself
into
very
serious
what
is
that
fisher
asked
the
girl
there
was
a
gentleman
coming
to
see
kara
whom
kara
particularly
wanted
to
mr
gathercole
said
the
girl
quickly
fisher
nodded
yes
miss
i
could
get
him
to
stay
she
pursed
her
lips
thoughtfully
mr
kara
will
be
very
cross
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
it
i
wish
you
had
called
he
never
gave
a
chance
miss
said
fisher
with
a
little
smile
but
if
he
comes
again
i
show
him
straight
up
to
she
nodded
is
there
anything
you
want
miss
he
asked
as
he
stood
at
the
door
what
time
did
kara
say
he
would
be
back
at
six
miss
the
man
replied
there
is
rather
an
important
letter
here
which
has
to
be
shall
i
ring
up
for
a
messenger
no
i
do
think
that
would
be
advisable
you
had
better
take
it
kara
was
in
the
habit
of
employing
fisher
as
a
confidential
messenger
when
the
occasion
demanded
such
employment
i
will
go
with
pleasure
miss
he
said
it
was
a
opportunity
for
fisher
who
had
been
inventing
some
excuse
for
leaving
the
house
she
handed
him
the
letter
and
he
read
without
a
droop
of
eyelid
the
superscription
t
meredith
special
service
scotland
yard
he
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
and
went
from
the
room
to
change
large
as
the
house
was
kara
did
not
employ
a
regular
staff
of
servants
a
maid
and
a
valet
comprised
the
whole
of
the
indoor
staff
his
cook
and
the
other
domestics
necessary
for
conducting
an
establishment
of
that
size
were
engaged
by
the
day
kara
had
returned
from
the
country
earlier
than
had
been
anticipated
and
save
for
fisher
the
only
other
person
in
the
house
beside
the
girl
was
the
domestic
who
was
and
housekeeper
in
one
miss
holland
sat
at
her
desk
to
all
appearance
reading
over
the
letters
she
had
typed
that
afternoon
but
her
mind
was
very
far
from
the
correspondence
before
her
she
heard
the
soft
thud
of
the
front
door
closing
and
rising
she
crossed
the
room
rapidly
and
looked
down
through
the
window
to
the
street
she
watched
fisher
until
he
was
out
of
sight
then
she
descended
to
the
hall
and
to
the
kitchen
it
was
not
the
first
visit
she
had
made
to
the
big
underground
room
with
its
vaulted
roof
and
its
great
ranges
which
were
seldom
used
nowadays
for
kara
gave
no
dinners
the
maid
who
was
also
cook
arose
up
as
the
girl
entered
it
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
to
see
you
in
my
kitchen
miss
she
smiled
i
afraid
you
rather
lonely
beale
said
the
girl
sympathetically
lonely
miss
cried
the
maid
i
fairly
get
the
creeps
sitting
here
hour
after
hour
it
that
door
that
gives
me
the
she
pointed
to
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
to
a
soiled
looking
door
of
unpainted
wood
that
kara
wine
cellar
nobody
been
in
it
but
him
i
know
he
goes
in
sometimes
because
i
tried
a
dodge
that
my
brother
who
a
policeman
taught
me
i
stretched
a
bit
of
white
cotton
across
it
an
it
was
broke
the
next
mr
kara
keeps
some
of
his
private
papers
in
there
said
the
girl
quietly
he
has
told
me
so
h
said
the
woman
doubtfully
i
wish
he
brick
it
up
the
same
as
he
has
the
lower
cellar
i
get
the
horrors
sittin
here
at
night
expectin
the
door
to
open
an
the
ghost
of
the
mad
lord
to
come
out
him
that
was
killed
in
miss
holland
laughed
i
want
you
to
go
out
now
she
said
i
have
no
beale
obeyed
with
alacrity
and
whilst
she
was
assuming
a
hat
being
desirous
of
maintaining
her
prestige
as
housekeeper
in
the
eyes
of
cadogan
square
the
girl
ascended
to
the
upper
floor
again
she
watched
from
the
window
the
disappearing
figure
once
out
of
sight
miss
holland
went
to
work
with
a
remarkable
deliberation
and
thoroughness
from
her
bag
she
produced
a
small
purse
and
opened
it
in
that
case
was
a
new
steel
key
she
passed
swiftly
down
the
corridor
to
kara
room
and
made
straight
for
the
safe
in
two
seconds
it
was
open
and
she
was
examining
its
contents
it
was
a
large
safe
of
the
usual
type
there
were
four
steel
drawers
fitted
at
the
back
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
strong
box
two
of
these
were
unlocked
and
contained
nothing
more
interesting
than
accounts
relating
to
estate
in
albania
the
top
pair
were
locked
she
was
prepared
for
this
contingency
and
a
second
key
was
as
efficacious
as
the
first
an
examination
of
the
first
drawer
did
not
produce
all
that
she
had
expected
she
returned
the
papers
to
the
drawer
pushed
it
to
and
locked
it
she
gave
her
attention
to
the
second
drawer
her
hand
shook
a
little
as
she
pulled
it
open
it
was
her
last
chance
her
last
hope
there
were
a
number
of
small
almost
filling
the
drawer
she
took
them
out
one
by
one
and
at
the
bottom
she
found
what
she
had
been
searching
for
and
that
which
had
filled
her
thoughts
for
the
past
three
months
it
was
a
square
case
covered
in
red
morocco
leather
she
inserted
her
shaking
hand
and
took
it
out
with
a
triumphant
little
cry
at
last
she
said
aloud
and
then
a
hand
grasped
her
wrist
and
in
a
panic
she
turned
to
meet
the
smiling
face
of
kara
chapter
x
she
felt
her
knees
shake
under
her
and
thought
she
was
going
to
swoon
she
put
out
her
disengaged
hand
to
steady
herself
and
if
the
face
which
was
turned
to
him
was
pale
there
was
a
steadfast
resolution
in
her
dark
eyes
let
me
relieve
you
of
that
miss
holland
said
kara
in
his
silkiest
tones
he
wrenched
rather
than
took
the
box
from
her
hand
replaced
it
carefully
in
the
drawer
pushed
the
drawer
to
and
locked
it
examining
the
key
as
he
withdrew
it
then
he
closed
the
safe
and
locked
that
obviously
he
said
presently
i
must
get
a
new
he
had
not
released
his
hold
of
her
wrist
nor
did
he
until
he
had
led
her
from
the
room
back
to
the
library
then
he
released
the
girl
standing
between
her
and
the
door
with
folded
arms
and
that
cynical
quiet
contemptuous
smile
of
his
upon
his
handsome
face
there
are
many
courses
which
i
can
adopt
he
said
slowly
i
can
send
for
the
police
when
my
servants
whom
you
have
despatched
so
thoughtfully
have
returned
or
i
can
take
your
punishment
into
my
own
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
the
girl
coolly
you
may
send
for
the
she
leant
back
against
the
edge
of
the
desk
her
hands
holding
the
edge
and
faced
him
without
so
much
as
a
quaver
i
do
not
like
the
police
mused
kara
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
kara
turned
and
opened
it
and
after
a
low
strained
conversation
he
returned
closing
the
door
and
laid
a
paper
of
stamps
on
the
table
as
i
was
saying
i
do
not
care
for
the
police
and
i
prefer
my
own
method
in
this
particular
instance
the
police
obviously
would
not
serve
me
because
you
are
not
afraid
of
them
and
in
all
probability
you
are
in
their
pay
am
i
right
in
supposing
that
you
are
one
of
meredith
accomplices
i
do
not
know
meredith
she
replied
calmly
and
i
am
not
in
any
way
associated
with
the
nevertheless
he
persisted
you
do
not
seem
to
be
very
scared
of
them
and
that
removes
any
temptation
i
might
have
to
place
you
in
the
hands
of
the
law
let
me
see
he
pursed
his
lips
as
he
applied
his
mind
to
the
problem
she
half
sat
half
stood
watching
him
without
any
evidence
of
apprehension
but
with
a
heart
which
began
to
quake
a
little
for
three
months
she
had
played
her
part
and
the
strain
had
been
greater
than
she
had
confessed
to
herself
now
the
great
moment
had
come
and
she
had
failed
that
was
the
sickening
maddening
thing
about
it
all
it
was
not
the
fear
of
arrest
or
of
conviction
which
brought
a
sinking
to
her
heart
it
was
the
despair
of
failure
added
to
a
sense
of
her
helplessness
against
this
man
if
i
had
you
arrested
your
name
would
appear
in
all
the
papers
of
course
he
said
narrowly
and
your
photograph
would
probably
adorn
the
sunday
journals
he
added
expectantly
she
laughed
that
does
appeal
to
me
she
said
i
am
afraid
it
does
he
replied
and
strolled
towards
her
as
though
to
pass
her
on
his
way
to
the
window
he
was
abreast
of
her
when
he
suddenly
swung
round
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
he
caught
her
close
to
him
before
she
could
realise
what
he
planned
he
had
stooped
swiftly
and
kissed
her
full
upon
the
mouth
if
you
scream
i
shall
kiss
you
again
he
said
for
i
have
sent
the
maid
to
buy
some
more
stamps
to
the
general
post
let
me
go
she
gasped
now
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
terror
in
her
eyes
and
there
surged
within
him
that
mad
sense
of
triumph
that
intoxication
of
power
which
had
been
associated
with
the
red
letter
days
of
his
warped
life
you
afraid
he
bantered
her
half
whispering
the
words
afraid
now
are
you
if
you
scream
i
shall
kiss
you
again
do
you
hear
for
god
sake
let
me
go
she
whispered
he
felt
her
shaking
in
his
arms
and
suddenly
he
released
her
with
a
little
laugh
and
she
sank
trembling
from
head
to
foot
upon
the
chair
by
her
desk
now
you
going
to
tell
me
who
sent
you
here
he
went
on
harshly
and
why
you
came
i
never
suspected
you
i
thought
you
were
one
of
those
strange
creatures
one
meets
in
england
a
gentlewoman
who
prefers
working
for
her
living
to
the
more
simple
business
of
getting
married
and
all
the
time
you
were
spying
clever
very
clever
the
girl
was
thinking
rapidly
in
five
minutes
fisher
would
return
somehow
she
had
faith
in
fisher
ability
and
willingness
to
save
her
from
a
situation
which
she
realized
was
fraught
with
the
greatest
danger
to
herself
she
was
horribly
afraid
she
knew
this
man
far
better
than
he
suspected
realized
the
treachery
and
the
unscrupulousness
of
him
she
knew
he
would
stop
short
of
nothing
that
he
was
without
honour
and
without
a
single
attribute
of
goodness
he
must
have
read
her
thoughts
for
he
came
nearer
and
stood
over
her
you
need
shrink
my
young
friend
he
said
with
a
little
chuckle
you
are
going
to
do
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
and
your
first
act
will
be
to
accompany
me
downstairs
get
he
half
lifted
half
dragged
her
to
her
feet
and
led
her
from
the
room
they
descended
to
the
hall
together
and
the
girl
spoke
no
word
perhaps
she
hoped
that
she
might
wrench
herself
free
and
make
her
escape
into
the
street
but
in
this
she
was
disappointed
the
grip
about
her
arm
was
a
grip
of
steel
and
she
knew
safety
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
she
pulled
back
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
kitchen
where
are
you
taking
me
she
asked
i
am
going
to
put
you
into
safe
custody
he
said
on
the
whole
i
think
it
is
best
that
the
police
take
this
matter
in
hand
and
i
shall
lock
you
into
my
wine
cellar
and
go
out
in
search
of
a
the
big
wooden
door
opened
revealing
a
second
door
and
this
kara
unbolted
she
noticed
that
both
doors
were
sheeted
with
steel
the
outer
on
the
inside
and
the
inner
door
on
the
outside
she
had
no
time
to
make
any
further
observations
for
kara
thrust
her
into
the
darkness
he
switched
on
a
light
i
will
not
deny
you
that
he
said
pushing
her
back
as
she
made
a
frantic
attempt
to
escape
he
swung
the
outer
door
to
as
she
raised
her
voice
in
a
piercing
scream
and
clapping
his
hand
over
her
mouth
held
her
tightly
for
a
moment
i
have
warned
you
he
hissed
she
saw
his
face
distorted
with
rage
she
saw
kara
transfigured
with
devilish
anger
saw
that
handsome
almost
godlike
countenance
thrust
into
hers
flushed
and
seamed
with
malignity
and
a
hatefulness
beyond
understanding
and
then
her
senses
left
her
and
she
sank
limp
and
swooning
into
his
arms
when
she
recovered
consciousness
she
found
herself
lying
on
a
plain
stretcher
bed
she
sat
up
suddenly
kara
had
gone
and
the
door
was
closed
the
cellar
was
dry
and
clean
and
its
walls
were
enamelled
white
light
was
supplied
by
two
electric
lamps
in
the
ceiling
there
was
a
table
and
a
chair
and
a
small
washstand
and
air
was
evidently
supplied
through
unseen
ventilators
it
was
indeed
a
prison
and
no
less
and
in
her
first
moments
of
panic
she
found
herself
wondering
whether
kara
had
used
this
underground
dungeon
of
his
before
for
a
similar
purpose
she
examined
the
room
carefully
at
the
farthermost
end
was
another
door
and
this
she
pushed
gently
at
first
and
then
vigorously
without
producing
the
slightest
impression
she
still
had
her
bag
a
small
affair
of
black
moire
which
hung
from
her
belt
in
which
was
nothing
more
formidable
than
a
penknife
a
small
bottle
of
smelling
salts
and
a
pair
of
scissors
the
latter
she
had
used
for
cutting
out
those
paragraphs
from
the
daily
newspapers
which
referred
to
kara
movements
they
would
make
a
formidable
weapon
and
wrapping
her
handkerchief
round
the
handle
to
give
it
a
better
grip
she
placed
it
on
the
table
within
reach
she
was
dimly
conscious
all
the
time
that
she
had
heard
something
about
this
wine
cellar
something
which
if
she
could
recollect
it
would
be
of
service
to
her
then
in
a
flash
she
remembered
that
there
was
a
lower
cellar
which
according
to
beale
was
never
used
and
was
bricked
up
it
was
approached
from
the
outside
down
a
circular
flight
of
stairs
there
might
be
a
way
out
from
that
direction
and
would
there
not
be
some
connection
between
the
upper
cellar
and
the
lower
she
set
to
work
to
make
a
closer
examination
of
the
apartment
the
floor
was
of
concrete
covered
with
a
light
rush
matting
this
she
carefully
rolled
up
starting
at
the
door
one
half
of
the
floor
was
uncovered
without
revealing
the
existence
of
any
trap
she
attempted
to
pull
the
table
into
the
centre
of
the
room
better
to
roll
the
matting
but
found
it
fixed
to
the
wall
and
going
down
on
her
knees
she
discovered
that
it
had
been
fixed
after
the
matting
had
been
laid
obviously
there
was
no
need
for
the
fixture
and
she
tapped
the
floor
with
her
little
knuckle
her
heart
started
racing
the
sound
her
knocking
gave
forth
was
a
hollow
one
she
sprang
up
took
her
bag
from
the
table
opened
the
little
penknife
and
cut
carefully
through
the
thin
rushes
she
might
have
to
replace
the
matting
and
it
was
necessary
she
should
do
her
work
tidily
soon
the
whole
of
the
trap
was
revealed
there
was
an
iron
ring
which
fitted
flush
with
the
top
and
which
she
pulled
the
trap
yielded
and
swung
back
as
though
there
were
a
counterbalance
at
the
other
end
as
indeed
there
was
she
peered
down
there
was
a
dim
light
below
the
reflection
of
a
light
in
the
distance
a
flight
of
steps
led
down
to
the
lower
level
and
after
a
second
hesitation
she
swung
her
legs
over
the
cavity
and
began
her
descent
she
was
in
a
cellar
slightly
smaller
than
that
above
her
the
light
she
had
seen
came
from
an
inner
apartment
which
would
be
underneath
the
kitchen
of
the
house
she
made
her
way
cautiously
along
stepping
on
the
first
of
the
rooms
she
came
to
was
there
was
a
thick
carpet
on
the
floor
comfortable
a
little
bookcase
well
filled
and
a
reading
lamp
this
must
be
underground
study
where
he
kept
his
precious
papers
a
smaller
room
gave
from
this
and
again
it
was
doorless
she
looked
in
and
after
her
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
darkness
she
saw
that
it
was
a
bathroom
handsomely
fitted
the
room
she
was
in
was
also
without
any
light
which
came
from
the
farthermost
chamber
as
the
girl
strode
softly
across
the
room
she
trod
on
something
hard
she
stooped
and
felt
along
the
floor
and
her
fingers
encountered
a
thin
steel
chain
the
girl
was
she
shrunk
back
from
the
entrance
of
the
inner
room
fearful
of
what
she
would
see
and
then
from
the
interior
came
a
sound
that
made
her
tingle
with
horror
it
was
a
sound
of
a
sigh
long
and
trembling
she
set
her
teeth
and
strode
through
the
doorway
and
stood
for
a
moment
staring
with
open
eyes
and
mouth
at
what
she
saw
my
god
she
breathed
london
in
the
twentieth
century
chapter
xi
superintendent
mansus
had
a
little
office
in
scotland
yard
proper
which
he
complained
was
not
so
much
a
private
bureau
as
a
to
which
repaired
every
official
of
the
police
service
who
found
time
hanging
on
his
hands
on
the
afternoon
of
miss
surprising
adventure
a
plainclothes
man
of
d
division
brought
to
mansus
room
a
very
scared
domestic
servant
voluble
tearful
and
agonizingly
penitent
it
was
a
mood
not
wholly
unfamiliar
to
a
police
officer
of
twenty
years
experience
and
mansus
was
not
impressed
if
you
will
kindly
shut
up
he
said
blending
his
natural
politeness
with
his
employment
of
the
vernacular
and
if
you
will
also
answer
a
few
questions
i
will
save
you
a
lot
of
trouble
you
were
lady
bartholomew
maid
were
you
yes
sir
sobbed
the
mary
ann
and
you
have
been
detected
trying
to
pawn
a
gold
bracelet
the
property
of
lady
bartholomew
the
maid
gulped
nodded
and
started
breathlessly
upon
a
recital
of
her
wrongs
yes
sir
but
she
practically
gave
it
to
me
sir
and
i
have
had
my
wages
for
two
months
sir
and
she
can
give
that
foreigner
thousands
and
thousands
of
pounds
at
a
time
sir
but
her
poor
servants
she
pay
no
she
ca
and
if
sir
william
knew
especially
about
my
cards
and
about
the
snuffbox
what
would
he
think
i
wonder
and
going
to
have
my
rights
for
if
she
can
pay
thousands
to
a
swell
like
kara
she
can
pay
me
and
mansus
jerked
his
head
take
her
down
to
the
cells
he
said
briefly
and
they
led
her
away
a
wailing
woeful
figure
of
amateur
larcenist
in
three
minutes
mansus
was
with
and
had
reduced
the
incoherence
to
something
like
order
this
is
important
said
produce
the
the
asked
the
puzzled
officer
the
skivvy
slavey
hired
help
get
busy
said
impatiently
they
brought
her
to
in
a
condition
bordering
upon
collapse
get
her
a
cup
of
tea
said
the
wise
chief
sit
down
mary
ann
and
forget
all
your
oh
sir
i
never
been
in
this
position
before
she
began
as
she
flopped
into
the
chair
they
put
for
her
then
you
had
a
very
tiring
time
said
x
now
listen
i
been
respectable
forget
it
said
wearily
listen
if
you
tell
me
the
whole
truth
about
lady
bartholomew
and
the
money
she
paid
to
kara
two
thousand
pounds
two
separate
thousand
and
by
all
if
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
i
compound
a
felony
and
let
you
go
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
prevail
upon
her
to
clear
her
speech
of
the
ego
which
insisted
upon
intruding
there
were
gaps
in
her
narrative
which
he
bridged
in
the
main
it
was
a
believable
story
lady
bartholomew
had
lost
money
and
had
borrowed
from
kara
she
had
given
as
security
the
snuffbox
presented
to
her
husband
father
a
doctor
by
one
of
the
czars
for
services
rendered
and
was
all
blue
enamel
and
gold
and
foreign
words
in
on
the
question
of
the
amount
lady
bartholomew
had
borrowed
abigail
was
very
vague
all
that
she
knew
was
that
my
lady
had
paid
back
two
thousand
pounds
and
that
she
was
still
very
distressed
in
a
fit
was
the
phrase
the
girl
used
because
apparently
kara
refused
to
restore
the
box
there
had
evidently
been
terrible
scenes
in
the
bartholomew
menage
hysterics
and
what
not
the
principal
breakdown
having
occurred
when
belinda
mary
came
home
from
school
in
france
miss
bartholomew
is
home
then
where
is
she
asked
x
here
the
girl
was
more
vague
than
ever
she
thought
the
young
lady
had
gone
back
again
anyway
miss
belinda
had
been
very
much
upset
miss
belinda
had
seen
williams
and
advised
that
her
mother
should
go
away
for
a
change
miss
belinda
seems
to
be
a
precocious
young
person
said
x
did
she
by
any
chance
see
kara
oh
no
explained
the
girl
miss
belinda
was
above
that
sort
of
person
miss
belinda
was
a
lady
if
ever
there
was
and
how
old
is
this
interesting
young
woman
asked
curiously
she
is
nineteen
said
the
girl
and
the
commissioner
who
had
pictured
belinda
in
short
plaid
frocks
and
long
pigtails
and
had
moreover
visualised
her
as
a
freckled
little
girl
with
thin
legs
and
snub
nose
was
abashed
he
delivered
a
short
lecture
on
the
sacred
rights
of
property
paid
the
girl
the
three
months
wages
which
were
due
to
her
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
legality
of
her
claim
and
dismissed
her
with
instructions
to
go
back
to
the
house
pack
her
box
and
clear
out
after
the
girl
had
gone
sat
down
to
consider
the
position
he
might
see
kara
and
since
kara
had
expressed
his
contrition
and
was
probably
in
a
more
humble
state
of
mind
he
might
make
reparation
then
again
he
might
not
mansus
was
waiting
and
walked
back
with
him
to
his
little
office
i
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
said
in
despair
if
you
can
give
me
kara
motive
sir
i
can
give
you
a
solution
said
mansus
shook
his
head
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
unable
to
give
you
he
said
he
perched
himself
on
mansus
desk
and
lit
a
cigar
i
have
a
good
mind
to
go
round
and
see
him
he
said
after
a
while
why
not
telephone
to
him
asked
mansus
there
is
his
straight
into
his
he
pointed
to
a
small
telephone
in
a
corner
of
the
room
oh
he
persuaded
the
commissioner
to
run
the
wire
did
he
said
interested
and
walked
over
to
the
telephone
he
fingered
the
receiver
for
a
little
while
and
was
about
to
take
it
off
but
changed
his
mind
i
think
not
he
said
i
go
round
and
see
him
i
hope
to
succeed
in
extracting
the
confidence
in
the
case
of
lady
bartholomew
which
he
denied
me
over
poor
i
suppose
you
never
give
up
hope
of
seeing
lexman
again
smiled
mansus
busily
arranging
a
new
blotting
pad
before
could
answer
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
uniformed
policeman
entered
he
saluted
x
they
just
sent
an
urgent
letter
across
from
your
office
sir
i
said
i
thought
you
were
he
handed
the
missive
to
the
commissioner
took
it
and
glanced
at
the
typewritten
address
it
was
marked
urgent
and
by
he
took
up
the
thin
steel
from
the
desk
and
slit
open
the
envelope
the
letter
consisted
of
three
or
four
pages
of
manuscript
and
unlike
the
envelope
it
was
handwritten
my
dear
it
began
and
the
handwriting
was
familiar
mansus
watching
the
commissioner
saw
the
puzzled
frown
gather
on
his
superior
forehead
saw
the
eyebrows
arch
and
the
mouth
open
in
astonishment
saw
him
hastily
turn
to
the
last
page
to
read
the
signature
and
then
howling
apples
gasped
x
it
from
john
lexman
his
hand
shook
as
he
turned
the
closely
written
pages
the
letter
was
dated
that
afternoon
there
was
no
other
address
than
my
dear
it
began
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
letter
will
give
you
a
little
shock
because
most
of
my
friends
will
have
believed
that
i
am
gone
beyond
return
fortunately
or
unfortunately
that
is
not
so
for
myself
i
could
wish
but
i
am
not
going
to
take
a
very
gloomy
view
since
i
am
genuinely
pleased
at
the
thought
that
i
shall
be
meeting
you
again
forgive
this
letter
if
it
is
incoherent
but
i
have
only
this
moment
returned
and
am
writing
at
the
charing
cross
hotel
i
am
not
staying
here
but
i
will
let
you
have
my
address
later
the
crossing
has
been
a
very
severe
one
so
you
must
forgive
me
if
my
letter
sounds
a
little
disjointed
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
my
dear
wife
is
dead
she
died
abroad
about
six
months
ago
i
do
not
wish
to
talk
very
much
about
it
so
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
do
not
tell
you
any
more
my
principal
object
in
writing
to
you
at
the
moment
is
an
official
one
i
suppose
i
am
still
amenable
to
punishment
and
i
have
decided
to
surrender
myself
to
the
authorities
you
used
to
have
a
most
excellent
assistant
in
superintendent
mansus
and
if
it
is
convenient
to
you
as
i
hope
it
will
be
i
will
report
myself
to
him
at
at
any
rate
my
dear
i
do
not
wish
to
mix
you
up
in
my
affairs
and
if
you
will
let
me
do
this
business
through
mansus
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
know
there
is
no
great
punishment
awaiting
me
because
my
pardon
was
apparently
signed
on
the
night
before
my
escape
i
shall
not
have
much
to
tell
you
because
there
is
not
much
in
the
past
two
years
that
i
would
care
to
recall
we
endured
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness
and
death
was
very
merciful
when
it
took
my
beloved
from
me
do
you
ever
see
kara
in
these
days
will
you
tell
mansus
to
expect
me
at
between
ten
and
and
if
he
will
give
instructions
to
the
officer
on
duty
in
the
hall
i
will
come
straight
up
to
his
room
with
affectionate
regards
my
dear
fellow
i
am
yours
sincerely
john
read
the
letter
over
twice
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
poor
girl
he
said
softly
and
handed
the
letter
to
mansus
he
evidently
wants
to
see
you
because
he
is
afraid
of
using
my
friendship
to
his
advantage
i
shall
be
here
what
will
be
the
formality
asked
mansus
there
will
be
no
formality
said
the
other
briskly
i
will
secure
the
necessary
pardon
from
the
home
secretary
and
in
point
of
fact
i
have
it
already
promised
in
he
walked
back
to
whitehall
his
mind
fully
occupied
with
the
momentous
events
of
the
day
it
was
a
raw
february
evening
sleet
was
falling
in
the
street
a
piercing
easterly
wind
drove
even
through
his
thick
overcoat
in
such
doorways
as
offered
protection
from
the
bitter
elements
the
wreckage
of
humanity
which
clings
to
the
west
end
of
london
as
the
singed
moth
flutters
about
the
flame
that
destroys
it
were
huddled
for
warmth
was
a
man
of
vast
human
sympathies
all
his
experience
with
the
criminal
world
all
his
disappointments
all
his
disillusions
had
failed
to
quench
the
pity
for
his
unfortunate
fellows
he
made
it
a
rule
on
such
nights
as
these
that
if
by
chance
returning
late
to
his
office
he
should
find
such
a
shivering
piece
of
jetsam
sheltering
in
his
own
doorway
he
would
give
him
or
her
the
price
of
a
bed
in
his
own
quaint
way
he
derived
a
certain
speculative
excitement
from
this
practice
if
the
doorway
was
empty
he
regarded
himself
as
a
winner
if
some
one
stood
sheltered
in
the
deep
recess
which
is
a
feature
of
the
old
georgian
houses
in
this
historic
thoroughfare
he
would
lose
to
the
extent
of
a
shilling
he
peered
forward
through
the
as
he
neared
the
door
of
his
offices
i
lost
he
said
and
stripped
his
gloves
preparatory
to
groping
in
his
pocket
for
a
coin
somebody
was
standing
in
the
entrance
but
it
was
obviously
a
very
respectable
somebody
a
dumpy
motherly
somebody
in
a
coat
and
a
preposterous
bonnet
hullo
said
in
surprise
are
you
trying
to
get
in
here
i
want
to
see
meredith
said
the
visitor
in
the
mincing
affected
tones
of
one
who
excused
the
vulgar
source
of
her
prosperity
by
frequently
reiterated
claims
to
having
seen
better
days
your
longing
shall
be
gratified
said
gravely
he
unlocked
the
heavy
door
passed
through
the
uncarpeted
passage
there
are
no
frills
on
government
offices
and
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
to
the
suite
on
the
first
floor
which
constituted
his
bureau
he
switched
on
all
the
lights
and
surveyed
his
visitor
a
comfortable
person
of
the
landlady
type
a
good
sort
thought
but
somewhat
overweighted
with
lorgnettes
and
you
will
pardon
my
coming
to
see
you
at
this
hour
of
the
night
she
began
deprecatingly
but
as
my
dear
father
used
to
say
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
your
dear
father
being
in
the
garter
business
suggested
humorously
wo
you
sit
down
mrs
cassley
beamed
the
lady
as
she
seated
herself
he
was
in
the
paper
hanging
business
but
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
as
the
saying
what
particular
devil
is
driving
you
cassley
asked
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
object
of
this
visit
i
may
be
doing
wrong
began
the
lady
pursing
her
lips
and
two
blacks
will
never
make
a
and
all
that
glitters
is
not
gold
suggested
a
little
wearily
will
you
please
tell
me
your
business
cassley
i
am
a
very
hungry
well
it
like
this
sir
said
cassley
dropping
her
erudition
and
coming
down
to
bedrock
homeliness
i
got
a
young
lady
stopping
with
me
as
respectable
a
gel
as
i
had
to
deal
with
and
i
know
what
respectability
is
i
might
tell
you
for
i
taken
professional
boarders
and
i
have
been
housekeeper
to
a
you
are
well
qualified
to
speak
said
with
a
smile
and
what
about
this
particular
young
lady
of
yours
by
the
way
what
is
your
address
marylebone
road
said
the
lady
sat
up
yes
he
said
quickly
what
about
your
young
lady
she
works
as
far
as
i
can
understand
said
the
loquacious
landlady
with
a
certain
kara
in
the
typewriting
line
she
came
to
me
four
months
never
mind
when
she
came
to
you
said
impatiently
have
you
a
message
from
the
lady
well
it
like
this
sir
said
cassley
leaning
forward
confidentially
and
speaking
in
the
hollow
tone
which
she
had
decided
should
accompany
any
revelation
to
a
police
officer
this
young
lady
said
to
me
i
do
come
any
night
by
you
must
go
to
and
tell
him
she
paused
dramatically
yes
yes
said
quickly
for
heaven
sake
go
on
him
said
cassley
belinda
mary
he
sprang
to
his
feet
belinda
mary
he
breathed
belinda
mary
in
a
flash
he
saw
it
all
this
girl
with
a
knowledge
of
modern
greek
who
was
working
in
house
was
there
for
a
purpose
kara
had
something
of
her
mother
something
that
was
vital
and
which
he
would
not
part
with
and
she
had
adopted
this
method
of
securing
that
some
thing
cassley
was
prattling
on
but
her
voice
was
merely
a
haze
of
sound
to
him
it
brought
a
strange
glow
to
his
heart
that
belinda
mary
should
have
thought
of
him
only
as
a
policeman
of
course
said
the
still
small
voice
of
his
official
self
perhaps
said
the
human
defiantly
he
got
on
the
telephone
to
mansus
and
gave
a
few
instructions
you
stay
here
he
ordered
the
astounded
cassley
i
am
going
to
make
a
few
kara
was
at
home
but
was
in
bed
remembered
that
this
extraordinary
man
invariably
went
to
bed
early
and
that
it
was
his
practice
to
receive
visitors
in
this
guarded
room
of
his
he
was
admitted
almost
at
once
and
found
kara
in
his
silk
lying
on
the
bed
smoking
the
heat
of
the
room
was
unbearable
even
on
that
bleak
february
night
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
said
kara
sitting
up
i
hope
you
mind
my
came
straight
to
the
point
where
is
miss
holland
he
asked
miss
holland
kara
eyebrows
advertised
his
astonishment
what
an
extraordinary
question
to
ask
me
my
dear
man
at
her
home
or
at
the
theatre
or
in
a
cinema
palace
i
do
know
how
these
people
employ
their
she
is
not
at
home
said
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
has
not
left
this
what
a
suspicious
person
you
are
meredith
kara
rang
the
bell
and
fisher
came
in
with
a
cup
of
coffee
on
a
tray
fisher
drawled
kara
mr
meredith
is
anxious
to
know
where
miss
holland
is
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
him
you
know
more
about
her
movements
than
i
as
far
as
i
know
sir
said
fisher
deferentially
she
left
the
house
about
her
usual
hour
she
sent
me
out
a
little
before
five
on
a
message
and
when
i
came
back
her
hat
and
her
coat
had
gone
so
i
presume
she
had
gone
did
you
see
her
go
asked
x
the
man
shook
his
head
no
sir
i
very
seldom
see
the
lady
come
or
go
there
has
been
no
restrictions
placed
upon
the
young
lady
and
she
has
been
at
liberty
to
move
about
as
she
likes
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
sir
he
turned
to
kara
kara
nodded
you
will
probably
find
her
at
he
shook
his
finger
waggishly
at
x
what
a
dog
you
are
he
jibed
i
ought
to
keep
the
beauties
of
my
household
veiled
as
we
do
in
the
east
and
especially
when
i
have
a
susceptible
policeman
wandering
at
gave
jest
for
jest
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
making
trouble
here
after
a
few
amiable
commonplaces
he
took
his
departure
he
found
cassley
being
entertained
by
mansus
with
a
wholly
fictitious
description
of
the
famous
criminals
he
had
arrested
i
can
only
suggest
that
you
go
home
said
x
i
will
send
a
police
officer
with
you
to
report
to
me
but
in
all
probability
you
will
find
the
lady
has
returned
she
may
have
had
a
difficulty
in
getting
a
bus
on
a
night
like
a
detective
was
summoned
from
scotland
yard
and
accompanied
by
him
cassley
returned
to
her
domicile
with
a
certain
importance
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
ten
whatever
happens
i
must
see
old
lexman
he
said
tell
the
best
men
we
got
in
the
department
to
stand
by
for
eventualities
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
busy
chapter
xii
kara
lay
back
on
his
down
pillows
with
a
sneer
on
his
face
and
his
brain
very
busy
what
started
the
train
of
thought
he
did
not
know
but
at
that
moment
his
mind
was
very
far
away
it
carried
him
back
a
dozen
years
to
a
dirty
little
peasant
cabin
on
the
hillside
outside
durazzo
to
the
livid
face
of
a
young
albanian
chief
who
had
lost
at
kara
whim
all
that
life
held
for
a
man
to
the
hateful
eyes
of
the
girl
father
who
stood
with
folded
arms
glaring
down
at
the
bound
and
manacled
figure
on
the
floor
to
the
rafters
of
this
peasant
cottage
and
the
dancing
shadows
on
the
roof
to
that
terrible
hour
of
waiting
when
he
sat
bound
to
a
post
with
a
candle
flickering
and
spluttering
lower
and
lower
to
the
little
heap
of
gunpowder
that
would
start
the
trail
toward
the
clumsy
infernal
machine
under
his
chair
he
remembered
the
day
well
because
it
was
candlemas
day
and
this
was
the
anniversary
he
remembered
other
things
more
pleasant
the
beat
of
hoofs
on
the
rocky
roadway
the
crash
of
the
door
falling
in
when
the
turkish
gendarmes
had
battered
a
way
to
his
rescue
he
remembered
with
a
savage
joy
the
spectacle
of
his
assassins
twitching
and
struggling
on
the
gallows
at
pezara
and
he
heard
the
faint
tinkle
of
the
front
door
bell
had
returned
he
slipped
from
the
bed
and
went
to
the
door
opened
it
slightly
and
listened
with
a
search
warrant
might
be
a
source
of
panic
especially
if
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
satisfied
and
allayed
his
suspicions
he
would
get
fisher
out
of
the
way
that
night
and
make
sure
the
voice
from
the
hall
below
was
loud
and
gruff
who
could
it
be
then
he
heard
fisher
foot
on
the
stairs
and
the
valet
entered
will
you
see
gathercole
now
mr
gathercole
kara
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
his
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
why
of
course
tell
him
to
come
up
ask
him
if
he
minds
seeing
me
in
my
i
told
him
you
were
in
bed
sir
and
he
used
shocking
language
said
fisher
kara
laughed
send
him
up
he
said
and
then
as
fisher
was
going
out
of
the
room
he
called
him
back
by
the
way
fisher
after
gathercole
has
gone
you
may
go
out
for
the
night
you
got
somewhere
to
go
i
suppose
and
you
need
come
back
until
the
yes
sir
said
the
servant
such
an
instruction
was
remarkably
pleasing
to
him
there
was
much
that
he
had
to
do
and
that
night
freedom
would
assist
him
materially
perhaps
kara
hesitated
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
until
eleven
bring
me
up
some
sandwiches
and
a
large
glass
of
milk
or
better
still
place
them
on
a
plate
in
the
very
good
sir
said
the
man
and
withdrew
down
below
that
grotesque
figure
with
his
shiny
hat
and
his
ragged
beard
was
walking
up
and
down
the
tesselated
hallway
muttering
to
himself
and
staring
at
the
various
objects
in
the
hall
with
a
certain
amused
antagonism
mr
kara
will
see
you
sir
said
fisher
oh
said
the
other
glaring
at
the
unoffending
fisher
that
very
good
of
him
very
good
of
this
person
to
see
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
who
has
been
about
his
dirty
business
for
three
years
grown
grey
in
his
service
do
you
understand
that
my
man
yes
sir
said
fisher
look
here
the
man
thrust
out
his
face
do
you
see
those
grey
hairs
in
my
beard
the
embarrassed
fisher
grinned
is
it
grey
challenged
the
visitor
with
a
roar
yes
sir
said
the
valet
hastily
is
it
real
grey
insisted
the
visitor
pull
one
out
and
see
the
startled
fisher
drew
back
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
could
think
of
doing
a
thing
like
that
oh
you
could
sneered
the
visitor
then
lead
on
fisher
showed
the
way
up
the
stairs
this
time
the
traveller
carried
no
books
his
left
arm
hung
limply
by
his
side
and
fisher
privately
gathered
that
the
hand
had
got
loose
from
the
detaining
pocket
without
its
owner
being
aware
of
the
fact
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
announced
mr
gathercole
and
kara
came
forward
with
a
smile
to
meet
his
agent
who
with
top
hat
still
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
his
overcoat
dangling
about
his
heels
must
have
made
a
remarkable
picture
fisher
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
returned
to
his
duties
in
the
hall
below
ten
minutes
later
he
heard
the
door
opened
and
the
booming
voice
of
the
stranger
came
down
to
him
fisher
went
up
the
stairs
to
meet
him
and
found
him
addressing
the
occupant
of
the
room
in
his
own
eccentric
fashion
no
more
patagonia
he
roared
no
more
tierra
del
fuego
he
paused
certainly
he
replied
to
some
question
but
not
patagonia
he
paused
again
and
fisher
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
wondered
what
had
occurred
to
make
the
visitor
so
genial
i
suppose
your
cheque
will
be
honoured
all
right
asked
the
visitor
sardonically
and
then
burst
into
a
little
chuckle
of
laughter
as
he
carefully
closed
the
door
he
came
down
the
corridor
talking
to
himself
and
greeted
fisher
damn
all
greeks
he
said
jovially
and
fisher
could
do
no
more
than
smile
reproachfully
the
smile
being
his
very
own
the
reproach
being
on
behalf
of
the
master
who
paid
him
the
traveller
touched
the
other
on
the
chest
with
his
right
hand
never
trust
a
greek
he
said
always
get
your
money
in
advance
is
that
clear
to
you
yes
sir
said
fisher
but
i
think
you
will
always
find
that
kara
is
always
most
generous
about
do
you
believe
it
do
you
believe
it
my
poor
man
said
the
other
you
at
that
moment
there
came
from
kara
room
a
faint
what
that
asked
the
visitor
a
little
startled
mr
kara
put
down
his
steel
latch
said
fisher
with
a
smile
which
means
that
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
until
he
looked
at
his
watch
until
eleven
at
any
he
a
funk
snapped
the
other
a
beastly
funk
he
stamped
down
the
stairs
as
though
testing
the
weight
of
every
tread
opened
the
front
door
without
assistance
slammed
it
behind
him
and
disappeared
into
the
night
fisher
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looked
after
the
departing
stranger
nodding
his
head
in
reprobation
you
a
queer
old
devil
he
said
and
looked
at
his
watch
again
it
wanted
five
minutes
to
ten
chapter
xiii
if
you
would
care
to
come
in
sir
i
sure
lexman
would
be
glad
to
see
you
said
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
an
interest
in
the
the
chief
commissioner
of
police
growled
something
about
being
paid
to
take
an
interest
in
everybody
and
strolled
with
down
one
of
the
apparently
endless
corridors
of
scotland
yard
you
wo
have
any
bother
about
the
pardon
he
said
i
was
dining
with
old
man
bartholomew
and
he
will
fix
that
up
in
the
there
will
be
no
necessity
to
detain
lexman
in
custody
asked
x
the
chief
shook
his
head
none
whatever
he
said
there
was
a
pause
then
by
the
way
did
bartholomew
mention
belinda
mary
the
chief
looked
round
in
astonishment
and
who
the
devil
is
belinda
mary
he
asked
went
red
belinda
mary
he
said
a
little
quickly
is
bartholomew
by
jove
said
the
commissioner
now
you
mention
it
he
did
she
is
still
in
oh
is
she
said
innocently
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
wished
most
fervently
that
she
was
they
came
to
the
room
which
mansus
occupied
and
found
that
admirable
man
waiting
wherever
policemen
meet
their
conversation
naturally
drifts
to
shop
and
in
two
minutes
the
three
were
discussing
with
some
animation
and
much
difference
of
opinion
as
far
as
was
concerned
a
series
of
frauds
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
midlands
and
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
story
your
friend
is
late
said
the
chief
commissioner
there
he
is
cried
springing
up
he
heard
a
familiar
footstep
on
the
flagged
corridor
and
sprung
out
of
the
room
to
meet
the
newcomer
for
a
moment
he
stood
wringing
the
hand
of
this
grave
man
his
heart
too
full
for
words
my
dear
chap
he
said
at
last
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
john
lexman
said
nothing
then
i
am
sorry
to
bring
you
into
this
business
he
said
quietly
nonsense
said
the
other
come
in
and
see
the
he
took
john
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
superintendent
room
there
was
a
change
in
john
lexman
a
subtle
shifting
of
balance
which
was
not
readily
discoverable
his
face
was
older
the
mobile
mouth
a
little
more
grimly
set
the
eyes
more
deeply
lined
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
looked
as
thought
a
typical
clean
english
gentleman
such
an
one
as
any
valet
would
be
proud
to
say
he
had
turned
looking
at
him
carefully
could
see
no
great
change
save
that
down
one
side
of
his
smooth
shaven
cheek
ran
the
scar
of
an
old
wound
which
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
superficial
i
must
apologize
for
this
kit
said
john
taking
off
his
overcoat
and
laying
it
across
the
back
of
a
chair
but
the
fact
is
i
was
so
bored
this
evening
that
i
had
to
do
something
to
pass
the
time
away
so
i
dressed
and
went
to
the
theatre
and
was
more
bored
than
noticed
that
he
did
not
smile
and
that
when
he
spoke
it
was
slowly
and
carefully
as
though
he
were
weighing
the
value
of
every
word
now
he
went
on
i
have
come
to
deliver
myself
into
your
i
suppose
you
have
not
seen
kara
said
x
i
have
no
desire
to
see
kara
was
the
short
reply
well
lexman
broke
in
the
chief
i
do
think
you
are
going
to
have
any
difficulty
about
your
escape
by
the
way
i
suppose
it
was
by
aeroplane
lexman
nodded
and
you
had
an
assistant
again
lexman
nodded
unless
you
press
me
i
would
rather
not
discuss
the
matter
for
some
little
time
sir
george
he
said
there
is
much
that
will
happen
before
the
full
story
of
my
escape
is
made
sir
george
nodded
we
will
leave
it
at
that
he
said
cheerily
and
now
i
hope
you
have
come
back
to
delight
us
all
with
one
of
your
wonderful
for
the
time
being
i
have
done
with
wonderful
plots
said
john
lexman
in
that
even
deliberate
tone
of
his
i
hope
to
leave
london
next
week
for
new
york
and
take
up
such
of
the
threads
of
life
as
remain
the
greater
thread
has
the
chief
commissioner
understood
the
silence
which
followed
was
broken
by
the
loud
and
insistent
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell

mansus
rising
quickly
that
kara
with
two
quick
strides
he
was
at
the
telephone
and
lifted
down
the
receiver
hullo
he
cried
hullo
he
cried
again
there
was
no
reply
only
the
continuous
buzzing
and
when
he
hung
up
the
receiver
again
the
bell
continued
ringing
the
three
policemen
looked
at
one
another

he
said
gripping
the
shoulder
affectionately
john
lexman
did
not
speak
for
the
moment
if

happened
to
kara
he
said
slowly
if
the
worst
that
was
possible
happened
to
him
believe
me
i
should
not

down
into
the
other

sympathetically

badly

said
gently
john

nodded
he

he
said
between
his
teeth
the
chief
commissioner
motor
car
was
waiting
outside
and
in
this
mansus
and
a
were
whirled
off
to
cadogan
square
fisher
was
in
the
hall
when
they
rung
the
bell
and
opened
the
door
instantly
he
was
frankly
surprised
to
see
his
visitors
kara
was
in
his
room
he
explained
resentfully
as
though
should
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
without
being
told
he
had
heard
no
bell
ringing
and
indeed
had
not
been
summoned
to
the
room
i
have
to
see
him
at
eleven
he
said
and
i
have
had
standing
instructions
not
to
go
to
him
unless
i
am
sent
led
the
way
upstairs
and
went
straight
to
kara
room
he
knocked
but
there
was
no
reply
he
knocked
again
and
on
this
failing
to
evoke
any
response
kicked
heavily
at
the
door
have
you
a
telephone
downstairs
he
asked
yes
sir
replied
fisher
turned
to
the
to
the
yard
he
said
and
get
a
man
up
with
a
bag
of
tools
we
shall
have
to
pick
this
lock
and
i
have
got
my
case
with
picking
the
lock
would
be
no
good
sir
said
fisher
an
interested
spectator
mr
kara
got
the
latch
i
forgot
that
said
x
tell
him
to
bring
his
saw
we
have
to
cut
through
the
panel
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
police
officer
strove
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
inmates
of
the
room
but
without
success
does
he
take
opium
or
anything
asked
mansus
fisher
shook
his
head
i
never
known
him
to
take
any
of
that
kind
of
stuff
he
said
made
a
rapid
survey
of
the
other
rooms
on
that
floor
the
room
next
to
kara
was
the
library
beyond
that
was
a
dressing
room
which
according
to
fisher
miss
holland
had
used
and
at
the
farthermost
end
of
the
corridor
was
the
dining
room
facing
the
dining
room
was
a
small
service
lift
and
by
its
side
a
storeroom
in
which
were
a
number
of
trunks
including
a
very
large
one
smothered
in
injunctions
in
three
different
languages
to
handle
with
there
was
nothing
else
of
interest
on
this
floor
and
the
upper
and
lower
floors
could
wait
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
carpenter
had
arrived
from
scotland
yard
and
had
bored
a
hole
in
the
rosewood
panel
of
kara
room
and
was
busily
applying
his
slender
saw
through
the
hole
he
cut
could
see
no
more
than
that
the
room
was
in
darkness
save
for
the
glow
of
a
blazing
fire
he
inserted
his
hand
groped
for
the
knob
of
the
steel
latch
which
he
had
remarked
on
his
previous
visit
to
the
room
lifted
it
and
the
door
swung
open
keep
outside
everybody
he
ordered
he
felt
for
the
switch
of
the
electric
found
it
and
instantly
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
the
bed
was
hidden
by
the
open
door
took
one
stride
into
the
room
and
saw
enough
kara
was
lying
half
on
and
half
off
the
bed
he
was
quite
dead
and
the
patch
above
his
heart
told
its
own
story
stood
looking
down
at
him
saw
the
frozen
horror
on
the
dead
face
then
drew
his
eyes
away
and
slowly
surveyed
the
room
there
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
he
found
his
clue
a
bent
and
twisted
little
candle
such
as
you
find
on
children
christmas
trees
chapter
xiv
it
was
mansus
who
found
the
second
candle
a
stouter
affair
it
lay
underneath
the
bed
the
telephone
which
stood
on
a
fairly
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
was
overturned
and
the
receiver
was
on
the
floor
by
its
side
were
two
books
one
being
the
balkan
question
by
villari
and
the
other
travels
and
politics
in
the
near
east
by
miller
with
them
was
a
long
ivory
there
was
nothing
else
on
the
save
a
silver
cigarette
box
drew
on
a
pair
of
gloves
and
examined
the
bright
surface
for
but
a
superficial
view
revealed
no
such
clue
open
the
window
said
the
heat
here
is
intolerable
be
very
careful
mansus
by
the
way
is
the
window
fastened
very
well
fastened
said
the
superintendent
after
a
careful
scrutiny
he
pushed
back
the
fastenings
lifted
the
window
and
as
he
did
a
harsh
bell
rang
in
the
basement
that
is
the
burglar
alarm
i
suppose
said
go
down
and
stop
that
he
addressed
fisher
who
stood
with
a
troubled
face
at
the
door
when
he
had
disappeared
gave
a
significant
glance
to
one
of
the
waiting
officers
and
the
man
sauntered
after
the
valet
fisher
stopped
the
bell
and
came
back
to
the
hall
and
stood
before
the
hall
fire
a
very
troubled
man
near
the
fire
was
a
big
oaken
writing
table
and
on
this
there
lay
a
small
envelope
which
he
did
not
remember
having
seen
before
though
it
might
have
been
there
for
some
time
for
he
had
spent
a
greater
portion
of
the
evening
in
the
kitchen
with
the
cook
he
picked
up
the
envelope
and
with
a
start
recognised
that
it
was
addressed
to
himself
he
opened
it
and
took
out
a
card
there
were
only
a
few
words
written
upon
it
but
they
were
sufficient
to
banish
all
the
colour
from
his
face
and
set
his
hands
shaking
he
took
the
envelope
and
card
and
flung
them
into
the
fire
it
so
happened
that
at
that
moment
mansus
had
called
from
upstairs
and
the
officer
who
had
been
told
off
to
keep
the
valet
under
observation
ran
up
in
answer
to
the
summons
for
a
moment
fisher
hesitated
then
hatless
and
coatless
as
he
was
he
crept
to
the
door
opened
it
leaving
it
ajar
behind
him
and
darting
down
the
steps
ran
like
a
hare
from
the
house
the
doctor
who
came
a
little
later
was
cautious
as
to
the
hour
of
death
if
you
got
your
telephone
message
at
as
you
say
that
was
probably
the
hour
he
was
killed
he
said
i
could
not
tell
within
half
an
hour
obviously
the
man
who
killed
him
gripped
his
throat
with
his
left
hand
there
are
the
bruises
on
his
neck
and
stabbed
him
with
the
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
disappearance
of
fisher
was
noticed
but
the
of
the
terrified
beale
removed
any
doubt
that
had
as
to
the
man
guilt
you
had
better
send
out
an
stations
message
and
pull
him
in
said
x
he
was
with
the
cook
from
the
moment
the
visitor
left
until
a
few
minutes
before
we
rang
besides
which
it
is
obviously
impossible
for
anybody
to
have
got
into
this
room
or
out
again
have
you
searched
the
dead
man
mansus
produced
a
tray
on
which
kara
belongings
had
been
disposed
the
ordinary
keys
beale
was
able
to
identify
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
beyond
her
recognised
one
of
these
as
the
key
of
the
safe
but
two
smaller
keys
baffled
him
not
a
little
and
beale
was
at
first
unable
to
assist
him
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
sir
she
said
is
the
wine
the
wine
cellar
said
slowly
that
must
be
he
stopped
the
greater
tragedy
of
the
evening
with
all
its
mystifying
aspects
had
not
banished
from
his
mind
the
thought
of
the
girl
that
belinda
mary
who
had
called
upon
him
in
her
hour
of
danger
as
he
divined
perhaps
he
descended
into
the
kitchen
and
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
unpainted
door
it
looks
more
like
a
prison
than
a
wine
cellar
he
said
that
what
i
always
thought
sir
said
beale
and
sometimes
i
had
a
horrible
feeling
of
he
cut
short
her
loquacity
by
inserting
one
of
the
keys
in
the
lock
it
did
not
turn
but
he
had
more
success
with
the
second
the
lock
snapped
back
easily
and
he
pulled
the
door
back
he
found
the
inner
door
bolted
top
and
bottom
the
bolts
slipped
back
in
their
sockets
without
any
effort
evidently
kara
used
this
place
pretty
frequently
thought
x
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
stopped
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
cellar
apartment
was
brilliantly
lit
but
it
was
unoccupied
this
beats
the
band
said
x
he
saw
something
on
the
table
and
lifted
it
up
it
was
a
pair
of
scissors
and
about
the
handle
was
wound
a
handkerchief
it
was
not
this
fact
which
startled
him
but
that
the
scissors
blades
were
dappled
with
blood
and
blood
too
was
on
the
handkerchief
he
unwound
the
flimsy
piece
of
cambric
and
stared
at
the
monogram
b
he
looked
around
nobody
had
seen
the
weapon
and
he
dropped
it
in
his
overcoat
pocket
and
walked
from
the
cellar
to
the
kitchen
where
beale
and
mansus
awaited
him
there
is
a
lower
cellar
is
there
not
he
asked
in
a
strained
voice
that
was
bricked
up
when
kara
took
the
house
explained
the
woman
there
is
nothing
more
to
look
for
here
he
said
he
walked
slowly
up
the
stairs
to
the
library
his
mind
in
a
whirl
that
he
an
accredited
officer
of
police
sworn
to
the
business
of
criminal
detection
should
attempt
to
screen
one
who
was
conceivably
a
criminal
was
inexplicable
but
if
the
girl
had
committed
this
crime
how
had
she
reached
kara
room
and
why
had
she
returned
to
the
locked
cellar
he
sent
for
beale
to
interrogate
her
she
had
heard
nothing
and
she
had
been
in
the
kitchen
all
the
evening
one
fact
she
did
reveal
however
that
fisher
had
gone
from
the
kitchen
and
had
been
absent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
returned
a
little
agitated
stay
here
said
and
went
down
again
to
the
cellar
to
make
a
further
search
probably
there
is
some
way
out
of
this
subterranean
jail
he
thought
and
a
diligent
search
of
the
room
soon
revealed
it
he
found
the
iron
trap
pulled
it
open
and
slipped
down
the
stairs
he
too
was
puzzled
by
the
luxurious
character
of
the
vault
he
passed
from
room
to
room
and
finally
came
to
the
inner
chamber
where
a
light
was
burning
the
light
as
he
discovered
proceeded
from
a
small
reading
lamp
which
stood
by
the
side
of
a
small
brass
bedstead
the
bed
had
recently
been
slept
in
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
occupant
conducted
a
very
careful
search
and
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
bricked
up
door
other
exits
there
were
none
the
floor
was
of
wood
block
laid
on
concrete
the
ventilation
was
excellent
and
in
one
of
the
recesses
which
had
evidently
held
at
so
time
or
other
a
large
wine
bin
there
was
a
prefect
electrical
cooking
plant
in
a
small
larder
were
a
number
of
baskets
bearing
the
name
of
a
caterer
one
of
them
containing
an
excellent
assortment
of
cold
and
potted
meats
preserves
etc
went
back
to
the
bedroom
and
took
the
little
lamp
from
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
began
a
more
careful
examination
presently
he
found
traces
of
blood
and
followed
an
irregular
trail
to
the
outer
room
he
lost
it
suddenly
at
the
foot
of
stairs
leading
down
from
the
upper
cellar
then
he
struck
it
again
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
electric
cord
and
was
now
depending
upon
an
electric
torch
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
there
were
indications
of
something
heavy
having
been
dragged
across
the
room
and
he
saw
that
it
led
to
a
small
bathroom
he
had
made
a
cursory
examination
of
this
apartment
and
now
he
proceeded
to
make
a
close
investigation
and
was
well
rewarded
the
bathroom
was
the
only
apartment
which
possess
anything
resembling
a
door
a
screen
and
as
he
pressed
this
back
he
felt
some
thing
which
prevented
its
wider
extension
he
slipped
into
the
room
and
flashed
his
lamp
in
the
space
behind
the
screen
there
stiff
in
death
with
glazed
eyes
and
lolling
tongue
lay
a
great
gaunt
dog
his
yellow
fangs
exposed
in
a
last
grimace
about
the
neck
was
a
collar
and
attached
to
that
a
few
links
of
broken
chain
mounted
the
steps
thoughtfully
and
passed
out
to
the
kitchen
did
belinda
mary
stab
kara
or
kill
the
dog
that
she
killed
one
hound
or
the
other
was
certain
that
she
killed
both
was
possible
chapter
xv
after
a
busy
and
sleepless
night
he
came
down
to
report
to
the
chief
commissioner
the
next
morning
the
evening
newspaper
bills
were
filled
with
the
chelsea
sensation
but
the
information
given
was
of
a
meagre
character
since
fisher
had
disappeared
many
of
the
details
which
could
have
been
secured
by
the
enterprising
pressmen
were
missing
there
was
no
reference
to
the
visit
of
gathercole
and
in
the
press
had
fallen
back
upon
a
statement
which
at
an
earlier
period
had
crept
into
the
newspapers
in
one
of
those
chatty
paragraphs
which
begin
i
saw
my
friend
kara
at
giros
and
end
with
a
brief
but
inaccurate
summary
of
his
hobbies
the
paragraph
had
been
to
the
effect
that
kara
had
been
in
fear
of
his
life
for
some
time
as
a
result
of
a
blood
feud
which
existed
between
himself
and
another
albanian
family
small
wonder
therefore
the
murder
was
everywhere
referred
to
as
the
political
crime
of
the
so
far
reported
to
his
superior
i
have
been
unable
to
trace
either
gathercole
or
the
valet
the
only
thing
we
know
about
gathercole
is
that
he
sent
his
article
to
the
times
with
his
card
the
servants
of
his
club
are
very
vague
as
to
his
whereabouts
he
is
a
very
eccentric
man
who
only
comes
in
occasionally
and
the
steward
whom
i
interviewed
says
that
it
frequently
happened
that
gathercole
arrived
and
departed
without
anybody
being
aware
of
the
fact
we
have
been
to
his
old
lodgings
in
lincoln
inn
but
apparently
he
sold
up
there
before
he
went
away
to
the
wilds
of
patagonia
and
relinquished
his
tenancy
the
only
clue
i
have
is
that
a
man
answering
to
some
extent
to
his
description
left
by
the
eleven
train
for
paris
last
you
have
seen
the
secretary
of
course
said
the
chief
it
was
a
question
which
had
been
dreading
gone
too
he
answered
shortly
in
fact
she
has
not
been
seen
since
yesterday
sir
george
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
rumpled
his
thick
grey
hair
the
only
person
who
seems
to
have
remained
he
said
with
heavy
sarcasm
was
kara
himself
would
you
like
me
to
put
somebody
else
on
this
case
it
is
exactly
your
job
or
will
you
carry
it
on
i
prefer
to
carry
it
on
sir
said
firmly
have
you
found
out
anything
more
about
kara
nodded
all
that
i
have
discovered
about
him
is
eminently
discreditable
he
said
he
seems
to
have
had
an
ambition
to
occupy
a
very
important
position
in
albania
to
this
end
he
had
bribed
and
subsidized
the
turkish
and
albanian
officials
and
had
a
fairly
large
following
in
that
country
bartholomew
tells
me
that
kara
had
already
sounded
him
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
british
government
recognising
a
fait
accompli
in
albania
and
had
been
inducing
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
cabinet
to
recognize
the
consequence
of
any
revolution
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
kara
has
engineered
all
the
political
assassinations
which
have
been
such
a
feature
in
the
news
from
albania
during
this
past
year
we
also
found
in
the
house
very
large
sums
of
money
and
documents
which
we
have
handed
over
to
the
foreign
office
for
sir
george
thought
for
a
long
time
then
he
said
i
have
an
idea
that
if
you
find
your
secretary
you
will
be
half
way
to
solving
the
went
out
from
the
office
in
anything
but
a
joyous
mood
he
was
on
his
way
to
lunch
when
he
remembered
his
promise
to
call
upon
john
lexman
could
lexman
supply
a
key
which
would
unravel
this
tragic
tangle
he
leant
out
of
his
and
redirected
the
driver
it
happened
that
the
cab
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
great
midland
hotel
as
john
lexman
was
coming
out
come
and
lunch
with
me
said
x
i
suppose
you
heard
all
the
i
read
about
kara
being
killed
if
that
what
you
mean
said
the
other
it
was
rather
a
coincidence
that
i
should
have
been
discussing
the
matter
last
night
at
the
very
moment
when
his
telephone
bell
rang
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
been
in
this
he
said
fretfully
why
asked
the
astonished
assistant
commissioner
and
what
do
you
mean
by
it
in
the
concrete
sense
i
wish
you
had
not
been
present
when
i
returned
said
the
other
moodily
i
wanted
to
be
finished
with
the
whole
sordid
business
without
in
any
way
involving
my
i
think
you
are
too
sensitive
laughed
the
other
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
i
want
you
to
unburden
yourself
to
me
my
dear
chap
and
tell
me
anything
you
can
that
will
help
me
to
clear
up
this
john
lexman
looked
straight
ahead
with
a
worried
frown
i
would
do
almost
anything
for
you
he
said
quietly
the
more
so
since
i
know
how
good
you
were
to
grace
but
i
ca
help
you
in
this
matter
i
hated
kara
living
i
hate
him
dead
he
cried
and
there
was
a
passion
in
his
voice
which
was
unmistakable
he
was
the
vilest
thing
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
there
was
no
villainy
too
despicable
no
cruelty
so
horrid
but
that
he
gloried
in
it
if
ever
the
devil
were
incarnate
on
earth
he
took
the
shape
and
the
form
of
remington
kara
he
died
too
merciful
a
death
by
all
accounts
but
if
there
is
a
god
this
man
will
suffer
for
his
crimes
in
hell
through
all
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
the
hate
in
the
man
face
took
his
breath
away
never
before
had
he
experienced
or
witnessed
such
a
vehemence
of
loathing
what
did
kara
do
to
you
he
demanded
the
other
looked
out
of
the
window
i
am
sorry
he
said
in
a
milder
tone
that
is
my
weakness
some
day
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
but
for
the
moment
it
were
better
that
it
were
not
told
i
will
tell
you
this
he
turned
round
and
faced
the
detective
squarely
kara
tortured
and
killed
my
said
no
more
half
way
through
lunch
he
returned
indirectly
to
the
subject
do
you
know
gathercole
he
asked
nodded
i
think
you
asked
me
that
question
once
before
or
perhaps
it
was
somebody
else
yes
i
know
him
rather
an
eccentric
man
with
an
artificial
that
the
cove
said
with
a
little
sigh
he
one
of
the
few
men
i
want
to
meet
just
why
because
he
was
apparently
the
last
man
to
see
kara
john
lexman
looked
at
the
other
with
an
impatient
jerk
of
his
shoulders
you
do
suspect
gathercole
do
you
he
asked
hardly
said
the
other
drily
in
the
first
place
the
man
that
committed
this
murder
had
two
hands
and
needed
them
both
no
i
only
want
to
ask
that
gentleman
the
subject
of
his
conversation
i
also
want
to
know
who
was
in
the
room
with
kara
when
gathercole
went
h
said
john
lexman
even
if
i
found
who
the
third
person
was
i
am
still
puzzled
as
to
how
they
got
out
and
fastened
the
heavy
latch
behind
them
now
in
the
old
days
lexman
he
said
good
humouredly
you
would
have
made
a
fine
mystery
story
out
of
this
how
would
you
have
made
your
man
escape
lexman
thought
for
a
while
have
you
examined
the
safe
he
asked
yes
said
the
other
was
there
very
much
in
it
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
just
the
ordinary
books
and
things
why
do
you
ask
suppose
there
were
two
doors
to
that
safe
one
on
the
outside
of
the
room
and
one
on
the
inside
would
it
be
possible
to
pass
through
the
safe
and
go
down
the
wall
i
have
thought
of
that
said
x
of
course
said
lexman
leaning
back
and
toying
with
a
in
writing
a
story
where
one
has
got
to
deal
with
the
absolute
possibilities
one
could
always
have
made
kara
have
a
safe
of
that
character
in
order
to
make
his
escape
in
the
event
of
danger
he
might
keep
a
rope
ladder
stored
inside
open
the
back
door
throw
out
his
ladder
to
a
friend
and
by
some
trick
arrangement
could
detach
the
ladder
and
allow
the
door
to
swing
to
a
very
ingenious
idea
said
but
unfortunately
it
does
work
in
this
case
i
have
seen
the
makers
of
the
safe
and
there
is
nothing
very
eccentric
about
it
except
the
fact
that
it
is
mounted
as
it
is
can
you
offer
another
suggestion
john
lexman
thought
again
i
will
not
suggest
trap
doors
or
secret
panels
or
anything
so
banal
he
said
nor
mysterious
springs
in
the
wall
which
when
touched
reveal
secret
he
smiled
slightly
in
my
early
days
i
must
confess
i
was
rather
keen
upon
that
sort
of
thing
but
age
has
brought
experience
and
i
have
discovered
the
impossibility
of
bringing
an
architect
to
one
way
of
thinking
even
in
so
commonplace
a
matter
as
the
position
of
a
scullery
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
induce
him
to
construct
a
house
with
double
walls
and
secret
waited
patiently
there
is
a
possibility
of
course
said
lexman
slowly
that
the
steel
latch
may
have
been
raised
by
somebody
outside
by
some
ingenious
magnetic
arrangement
and
lowered
in
a
similar
i
have
thought
about
it
said
triumphantly
and
i
have
made
the
most
elaborate
tests
only
this
morning
it
is
quite
impossible
to
raise
the
steel
latch
because
once
it
is
dropped
it
can
not
be
raised
again
except
by
means
of
the
knob
the
pulling
of
which
releases
the
catch
which
holds
the
bar
securely
in
its
place
try
another
one
john
lexman
threw
back
his
head
in
a
noiseless
laugh
why
i
should
be
helping
you
to
discover
the
murderer
of
kara
is
beyond
my
understanding
he
said
but
i
will
give
you
another
theory
at
the
same
time
warning
you
that
i
may
be
putting
you
off
the
track
for
god
knows
i
have
more
reason
to
murder
kara
than
any
man
in
the
he
thought
a
while
the
chimney
was
of
course
impossible
there
was
a
big
fire
burning
in
the
grate
explained
so
big
indeed
that
the
room
was
john
lexman
nodded
that
was
kara
way
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
the
suggestion
about
magnetism
in
the
steel
bar
was
impossible
because
i
was
friendly
with
kara
when
he
had
that
bar
put
in
and
pretty
well
know
the
mechanism
although
i
had
forgotten
it
for
the
moment
what
is
your
own
theory
by
the
way
pursed
his
lips
my
theory
is
very
clearly
formed
he
said
cautiously
but
so
far
as
it
goes
it
is
that
kara
was
lying
on
the
bed
probably
reading
one
of
the
books
which
were
found
by
the
bedside
when
his
assailant
suddenly
came
upon
him
kara
seized
the
telephone
to
call
for
assistance
and
was
promptly
again
there
was
silence
that
is
a
theory
said
john
lexman
with
his
curious
deliberation
of
speech
but
as
i
say
i
refuse
to
be
definite
have
you
found
the
weapon
shook
his
head
were
there
any
peculiar
features
about
the
room
which
astonished
you
and
which
you
have
not
told
me
hesitated
there
were
two
candles
he
said
one
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
one
under
the
bed
that
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
small
christmas
candle
the
one
under
the
bed
was
the
ordinary
candle
of
commerce
evidently
roughly
cut
and
probably
cut
in
the
room
we
found
traces
of
candle
chips
on
the
floor
and
it
is
evident
to
me
that
the
portion
which
was
cut
off
was
thrown
into
the
fire
for
here
again
we
have
a
trace
of
lexman
nodded
anything
further
he
asked
the
smaller
candle
was
twisted
into
a
sort
of
corkscrew
the
clue
of
the
twisted
candle
mused
john
lexman
that
a
very
good
title
kara
hated
why
lexman
leant
back
in
his
chair
selected
a
cigarette
from
a
silver
case
in
my
wanderings
he
said
i
have
been
to
many
strange
places
i
have
been
to
the
country
which
you
probably
do
not
know
and
which
the
traveller
who
writes
books
about
countries
seldom
visits
there
are
queer
little
villages
perched
on
the
spurs
of
the
bleakest
hills
you
ever
saw
i
have
lived
with
communities
which
acknowledge
no
king
and
no
government
these
have
their
laws
handed
down
to
them
from
father
to
son
it
is
a
nation
without
a
written
language
they
administer
their
laws
rigidly
and
drastically
the
punishments
they
award
are
cruel
inhuman
i
have
seen
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
stoned
to
death
as
in
the
best
biblical
traditions
and
i
have
seen
the
thief
shivered
i
have
seen
the
false
witness
stand
up
in
a
barbaric
market
place
whilst
his
tongue
was
torn
from
him
sometimes
the
turks
or
the
piebald
governments
of
the
state
sent
down
a
few
gendarmes
and
tried
a
sort
of
sporadic
administration
of
the
country
it
usually
ended
in
the
representative
of
the
law
lapsing
into
barbarism
or
else
disappearing
from
the
face
of
the
earth
with
a
whole
community
of
murderers
eager
to
testify
with
singular
unanimity
to
the
fact
that
he
had
either
committed
suicide
or
had
gone
off
with
the
wife
of
one
of
the
townsmen
in
some
of
these
communities
the
candle
plays
a
big
part
it
is
not
the
candle
of
commerce
as
you
know
it
but
a
dip
made
from
mutton
fat
strap
three
between
the
fingers
of
your
hands
and
keep
the
hand
rigid
with
two
flat
pieces
of
wood
then
let
the
candles
burn
down
lower
and
lower
can
you
imagine
or
set
a
candle
in
a
gunpowder
trail
and
lead
the
trail
to
a
heap
of
shavings
thoughtfully
heaped
about
your
naked
feet
or
a
candle
fixed
to
the
shaved
head
of
a
man
there
are
hundreds
of
variations
and
the
candle
plays
a
part
in
all
of
them
i
do
know
which
kara
had
cause
to
hate
the
worst
but
i
know
one
or
two
that
he
has
was
he
as
bad
as
that
asked
john
lexman
laughed
you
do
know
how
bad
he
was
he
said
towards
the
end
of
the
luncheon
the
waiter
brought
a
note
in
to
which
had
been
sent
on
from
his
office
dear
meredith
in
answer
to
your
enquiry
i
believe
my
daughter
is
in
london
but
i
did
not
know
it
until
this
morning
my
banker
informs
me
that
my
daughter
called
at
the
bank
this
morning
and
drew
a
considerable
sum
of
money
from
her
private
account
but
where
she
has
gone
and
what
she
is
doing
with
the
money
i
do
not
know
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
am
very
worried
about
this
matter
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
explain
what
it
is
all
it
was
signed
william
groaned
if
i
had
only
had
the
sense
to
go
to
the
bank
this
morning
i
should
have
seen
her
he
said
i
going
to
lose
my
job
over
the
other
looked
troubled
you
do
seriously
mean
not
exactly
smiled
but
i
do
think
the
chief
is
very
pleased
with
me
just
now
you
see
i
have
butted
into
this
business
without
any
authority
it
is
exactly
in
my
department
but
you
have
not
given
me
your
theory
about
the
i
have
no
theory
to
offer
said
the
other
folding
up
his
serviette
the
candles
suggest
a
typical
albanian
murder
i
do
not
say
that
it
was
so
i
merely
say
that
by
their
presence
they
suggest
a
crime
of
this
with
this
had
to
be
content
if
it
were
not
his
business
to
interest
himself
in
commonplace
murder
though
this
hardly
fitted
such
a
description
it
was
part
of
the
peculiar
function
which
his
department
exercised
to
restore
to
lady
bartholomew
a
certain
very
elaborate
which
he
discovered
in
the
safe
letters
had
been
found
amongst
his
papers
which
made
clear
the
part
which
kara
had
played
though
he
had
not
been
a
vulgar
blackmailer
he
had
retained
his
hold
not
only
upon
this
particular
property
of
lady
bartholomew
but
upon
certain
other
articles
which
were
discovered
with
no
other
object
apparently
than
to
compel
influence
from
quarters
likely
to
be
of
assistance
to
him
in
his
schemes
the
inquest
on
the
murdered
man
which
the
assistant
commissioner
attended
produced
nothing
in
the
shape
of
evidence
and
the
verdict
of
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
was
only
to
be
expected
spent
a
very
busy
and
a
very
tiring
week
tracing
elusive
clues
which
led
him
nowhere
he
had
a
letter
from
john
lexman
announcing
the
fact
that
he
intended
leaving
for
the
united
states
he
had
received
a
very
good
offer
from
a
firm
of
magazine
publishers
in
new
york
and
was
going
out
to
take
up
the
appointment
meredith
plans
were
now
in
fair
shape
he
had
decided
upon
the
line
of
action
he
would
take
and
in
the
pursuance
of
this
he
interviewed
his
chief
and
the
minister
of
justice
yes
i
have
heard
from
my
daughter
said
that
great
man
uncomfortably
and
really
she
has
placed
me
in
a
most
embarrassing
position
i
can
not
tell
you
meredith
exactly
in
what
manner
she
has
done
this
but
i
can
assure
you
she
can
i
see
her
letter
or
telegram
asked
x
i
am
afraid
that
is
impossible
said
the
other
solemnly
she
begged
me
to
keep
her
communication
very
secret
i
have
written
to
my
wife
and
asked
her
to
come
home
i
feel
the
constant
strain
to
which
i
am
being
subjected
is
more
than
human
can
i
suppose
said
patiently
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
tell
me
to
what
address
you
have
replied
to
no
address
answered
the
other
and
corrected
himself
hurriedly
that
is
to
say
i
only
received
the
telegram
the
message
this
morning
and
there
is
no
address
to
reply
i
see
said
x
that
afternoon
he
instructed
his
secretary
i
want
a
copy
of
all
the
agony
advertisements
in
papers
and
in
the
last
editions
of
the
evening
papers
have
them
ready
for
me
tomorrow
morning
when
i
they
were
waiting
for
him
when
he
reached
the
office
at
nine
the
next
day
and
he
went
through
them
carefully
presently
he
found
the
message
he
was
seeking
you
place
me
awkward
position
very
thoughtless
have
received
package
addressed
your
mother
which
have
placed
in
can
not
understand
why
you
want
me
to
go
away
and
give
servants
holiday
but
have
done
so
shall
require
very
full
explanation
matter
gone
far
enough
father
this
said
exultantly
as
he
read
the
advertisement
is
where
i
get
chapter
xvi
february
as
a
rule
is
not
a
month
of
fogs
but
rather
a
month
of
tempestuous
gales
of
frosts
and
snowfalls
but
the
night
of
february
was
one
of
calm
and
mist
it
was
not
the
typical
london
fog
so
dreaded
by
the
foreigner
but
one
of
those
little
patchy
mists
which
smoke
through
the
streets
now
enshrouding
and
making
the
nearest
object
invisible
now
clearing
away
to
the
finest
diaphanous
filament
of
pale
grey
sir
william
bartholomew
had
a
house
in
portman
place
which
is
a
wide
thoroughfare
filled
with
solemn
edifices
of
unlovely
and
forbidding
exterior
but
remarkably
comfortable
within
shortly
before
eleven
on
the
night
of
february
a
taxi
drew
up
at
the
junction
of
sussex
street
and
portman
place
and
a
girl
alighted
the
fog
at
that
moment
was
denser
than
usual
and
she
hesitated
a
moment
before
she
left
the
shelter
which
the
cab
afforded
she
gave
the
driver
a
few
instructions
and
walked
on
with
a
firm
step
turning
abruptly
and
mounting
the
steps
of
number
very
quickly
she
inserted
her
key
in
the
lock
pushed
the
door
open
and
closed
it
behind
her
she
switched
on
the
hall
light
the
house
sounded
hollow
and
deserted
a
fact
which
afforded
her
considerable
satisfaction
she
turned
the
light
out
and
found
her
way
up
the
broad
stairs
to
the
first
floor
paused
for
a
moment
to
switch
on
another
light
which
she
knew
would
not
be
observable
from
the
street
outside
and
mounted
the
second
flight
miss
belinda
mary
bartholomew
congratulated
herself
upon
the
success
of
her
scheme
and
the
only
doubt
that
was
in
her
mind
now
was
whether
the
boudoir
had
been
locked
but
her
father
was
rather
careless
in
such
matters
and
jacks
the
butler
was
one
of
those
dear
silly
old
men
who
never
locked
anything
and
in
consequence
faced
every
audit
with
a
long
face
and
a
longer
tale
of
the
peculations
of
occasional
servants
to
her
immense
relief
the
handle
turned
and
the
door
opened
to
her
touch
somebody
had
had
the
sense
to
pull
down
the
blinds
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
she
switched
on
the
light
with
a
sigh
of
relief
her
mother
writing
table
was
covered
with
unopened
letters
but
she
brushed
these
aside
in
her
search
for
the
little
parcel
it
was
not
there
and
her
heart
sank
perhaps
she
had
put
it
in
one
of
the
drawers
she
tried
them
all
without
result
she
stood
by
the
desk
a
picture
of
perplexity
biting
a
finger
thoughtfully
thank
goodness
she
said
with
a
jump
for
she
saw
the
parcel
on
the
mantel
shelf
crossed
the
room
and
took
it
down
with
eager
hands
she
tore
off
the
covering
and
came
to
the
familiar
leather
case
not
until
she
had
opened
the
padded
lid
and
had
seen
the
snuffbox
reposing
in
a
bed
of
cotton
wool
did
she
relapse
into
a
long
sigh
of
relief
thank
heaven
for
that
she
said
aloud
and
me
said
a
voice
she
sprang
up
and
turned
round
with
a
look
of
terror
mr
meredith
she
stammered
stood
by
the
window
curtains
from
whence
he
had
made
his
dramatic
entry
upon
the
scene
i
say
you
have
to
thank
me
also
miss
bartholomew
he
said
presently
how
do
you
know
my
name
she
asked
with
some
curiosity
i
know
everything
in
the
world
he
answered
and
she
smiled
suddenly
her
face
went
serious
and
she
demanded
sharply
who
sent
you
after
me
kara
mr
kara
he
repeated
in
wonder
he
threatened
to
send
for
the
police
she
went
on
rapidly
and
i
told
him
he
might
do
so
i
did
mind
the
police
it
was
kara
i
was
afraid
of
you
know
what
i
went
for
my
mother
she
held
the
in
her
outstretched
hand
he
accused
me
of
stealing
and
was
hateful
and
then
he
put
me
downstairs
in
that
awful
cellar
and
and
suggested
x
that
all
she
replied
with
tightened
lips
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
if
i
may
he
said
in
the
first
place
have
you
not
heard
anything
about
kara
since
you
went
away
she
shook
her
head
i
have
kept
out
of
his
way
she
said
grimly
have
you
seen
the
newspapers
he
asked
she
nodded
i
have
seen
the
advertisement
column
i
wired
asking
papa
to
reply
to
my
i
know
i
saw
it
he
smiled
that
is
what
brought
me
i
was
afraid
it
would
she
said
ruefully
father
is
awfully
loquacious
in
print
he
makes
speeches
you
know
all
i
wanted
him
to
say
was
yes
or
no
what
do
you
mean
about
the
newspapers
she
went
on
is
anything
wrong
with
mother
he
shook
his
head
so
far
as
i
know
lady
bartholomew
is
in
the
best
of
health
and
is
on
her
way
then
what
do
you
mean
by
asking
me
about
the
newspapers
she
demanded
why
should
i
see
the
newspapers
what
is
there
for
me
to
see
about
kara
he
suggested
she
shook
her
head
in
bewilderment
i
know
and
want
to
know
nothing
about
kara
why
do
you
say
this
to
me
because
said
slowly
on
the
night
you
disappeared
from
cadogan
square
remington
kara
was
murdered
she
gasped
he
nodded
he
was
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
some
person
or
persons
took
his
hand
from
his
pocket
and
pulled
something
out
which
was
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
this
he
carefully
removed
and
the
girl
watched
with
fascinated
gaze
and
with
an
awful
sense
of
apprehension
presently
the
object
was
revealed
it
was
a
pair
of
scissors
with
the
handle
wrapped
about
with
a
small
handkerchief
dappled
with
brown
stains
she
took
a
step
backward
raising
her
hands
to
her
cheeks
my
scissors
she
said
huskily
you
wo
think
she
stared
up
at
him
fear
and
indignation
struggling
for
mastery
i
do
think
you
committed
the
murder
he
smiled
if
that
what
you
mean
to
ask
me
but
if
anybody
else
found
those
scissors
and
had
identified
this
handkerchief
you
would
have
been
in
rather
a
fix
my
young
she
looked
at
the
scissors
and
shuddered
i
did
kill
something
she
said
in
a
low
voice
an
awful
dog
i
do
know
how
i
did
it
but
the
beastly
thing
jumped
at
me
and
i
just
stabbed
him
and
killed
him
and
i
am
glad
she
nodded
many
times
and
repeated
i
am
so
i
gather
i
found
the
dog
and
now
perhaps
you
explain
why
i
did
find
you
again
she
hesitated
and
he
felt
that
she
was
hiding
something
from
him
i
do
know
why
you
did
find
me
she
said
i
was
how
did
you
get
out
how
did
you
get
out
she
challenged
him
boldly
i
got
out
through
the
door
he
confessed
it
seems
a
ridiculously
commonplace
way
of
leaving
but
that
the
only
way
i
could
and
that
how
i
got
out
she
answered
with
a
little
smile
but
it
was
she
laughed
i
see
now
she
said
i
was
in
the
cellar
i
heard
your
key
in
the
lock
and
bolted
down
the
trap
leaving
those
awful
scissors
behind
i
thought
it
was
kara
with
some
of
his
friends
and
then
the
voices
died
away
and
i
ventured
to
come
up
and
found
you
had
left
the
door
open
so
so
i
these
queer
little
pauses
puzzled
x
there
was
something
she
was
not
telling
him
something
she
had
yet
to
reveal
so
i
got
away
you
see
she
went
on
i
came
out
into
the
kitchen
there
was
nobody
there
and
i
passed
through
the
area
door
and
up
the
steps
and
just
round
the
corner
i
found
a
taxicab
and
that
is
she
spread
out
her
hands
in
a
dramatic
little
gesture
and
that
is
all
is
it
said
x
that
is
all
she
repeated
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
stroked
his
chin
i
suppose
that
i
ought
to
arrest
you
i
feel
that
something
is
due
from
me
may
i
ask
if
you
were
sleeping
in
the
bed
downstairs
in
the
lower
cellar
she
demanded
a
little
pause
and
then
yes
i
was
sleeping
in
the
cellar
there
was
that
interval
of
hesitation
almost
between
each
word
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
again
she
was
feeling
more
sure
of
herself
and
had
suppressed
the
panic
which
his
sudden
appearance
had
produced
in
her
he
rumpled
his
hair
a
gross
imitation
did
she
but
know
it
of
one
of
his
chief
mannerisms
and
she
observed
that
his
hair
was
very
thick
and
inclined
to
curl
she
saw
also
that
he
was
passably
good
looking
had
fine
grey
eyes
a
straight
nose
and
a
most
firm
chin
i
think
she
suggested
gently
you
had
better
arrest
do
be
silly
he
begged
she
stared
at
him
in
amazement
what
did
you
say
she
asked
wrathfully
i
said
be
silly
repeated
the
calm
young
man
do
you
know
that
you
being
very
rude
she
asked
he
seemed
interested
and
surprised
at
this
novel
view
of
his
conduct
of
course
she
went
on
carefully
smoothing
her
dress
and
avoiding
his
eye
i
know
you
think
i
am
silly
and
that
i
got
a
most
comic
i
have
never
said
your
name
was
comic
he
replied
coldly
i
would
not
take
so
great
a
you
said
it
was
which
was
worse
she
claimed
i
may
have
said
it
was
he
admitted
but
that
rather
different
to
saying
it
was
there
is
dignity
in
weird
things
for
example
nightmares
are
comic
but
they
thank
you
she
said
pointedly
not
that
i
mean
your
name
is
anything
approaching
a
he
made
this
concession
with
a
most
magnificent
sweep
of
hand
as
though
he
were
a
king
conceding
her
the
right
to
remain
covered
in
his
presence
i
think
that
belinda
ann
belinda
mary
she
corrected
belinda
mary
i
was
going
to
say
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
floundered
i
was
going
to
say
belinda
and
you
were
going
to
say
nothing
of
the
kind
she
corrected
him
anyway
i
think
belinda
mary
is
a
very
pretty
you
think
nothing
of
the
she
saw
the
laughter
in
his
eyes
and
felt
an
insane
desire
to
laugh
you
said
it
was
a
weird
name
and
you
think
it
is
a
weird
name
but
i
really
ca
be
bothered
considering
everybody
views
i
think
it
a
weird
name
too
i
was
named
after
an
aunt
she
added
in
there
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
he
inclined
his
head
politely
i
was
named
after
my
father
favourite
what
does
stand
for
she
asked
curiously
thomas
xavier
he
said
and
she
leant
back
in
the
big
chair
on
the
edge
of
which
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
perched
herself
in
trepidation
and
dissolved
into
a
fit
of
immoderate
laughter
it
is
comic
is
it
he
asked
oh
i
am
sorry
i
so
rude
she
gasped
fancy
being
called
tommy
xavier
i
mean
thomas
you
may
call
me
tommy
if
you
wish
most
of
my
friends
unfortunately
i
not
your
friend
she
said
still
smiling
and
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
so
i
shall
go
on
calling
you
meredith
if
you
do
she
looked
at
her
watch
if
you
are
not
going
to
arrest
me
i
going
she
said
i
have
certainly
no
intention
of
arresting
you
said
he
but
i
am
going
to
see
you
home
she
jumped
up
smartly
you
not
she
commanded
she
was
so
definite
in
this
that
he
was
startled
my
dear
child
he
protested
please
do
child
me
she
said
seriously
you
going
to
be
a
good
little
tommy
and
let
me
go
home
by
she
held
out
her
hand
frankly
and
the
laughing
appeal
in
her
eyes
was
irresistible
well
i
see
you
to
a
cab
he
insisted
and
listen
while
i
give
the
driver
instructions
where
he
is
to
take
me
she
shook
her
head
reprovingly
it
must
be
an
awful
thing
to
be
a
he
stood
back
with
folded
arms
a
stern
frown
on
his
face
do
you
trust
me
he
asked
no
she
replied
quite
right
he
approved
anyway
i
see
you
to
the
cab
and
you
can
tell
the
driver
to
go
to
charing
cross
station
and
on
your
way
you
can
change
your
and
you
promise
you
wo
follow
me
she
asked
on
my
honour
he
swore
on
one
condition
i
will
make
no
conditions
she
replied
haughtily
please
come
down
from
your
great
big
horse
he
begged
and
listen
to
reason
the
condition
i
make
is
that
i
can
always
bring
you
to
an
appointed
rendezvous
whenever
i
want
you
honestly
this
is
necessary
belinda
miss
bartholomew
she
corrected
coldly
it
is
necessary
he
went
on
as
you
will
understand
promise
me
that
if
i
put
an
advertisement
in
the
agonies
of
either
an
evening
paper
which
i
will
name
or
in
the
morning
port
you
will
keep
the
appointment
i
fix
if
it
is
humanly
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
held
out
her
hand
i
promise
she
said
good
for
you
belinda
mary
said
he
and
tucking
her
arm
in
his
he
led
her
out
of
the
room
switching
off
the
light
and
racing
her
down
the
stairs
if
there
was
a
lot
of
the
schoolgirl
left
in
belinda
mary
bartholomew
no
less
of
the
schoolboy
was
there
in
this
commissioner
of
police
he
would
have
danced
her
through
the
fog
contemptuous
of
the
proprieties
but
he
was
so
very
anxious
to
get
her
to
her
cab
and
to
lose
sight
of
her
he
said
holding
her
hand
that
the
third
time
you
shaken
hands
with
me
she
interjected
do
let
us
have
any
unpleasantness
at
the
last
he
pleaded
and
i
have
promised
she
replied
and
one
day
he
went
on
you
will
tell
me
all
that
happened
in
that
i
have
told
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
have
not
told
me
everything
he
handed
her
into
the
cab
he
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
leant
through
the
open
window
victoria
or
marble
arch
he
asked
politely
charing
cross
she
replied
with
a
little
laugh
he
watched
the
cab
drive
away
and
then
suddenly
it
stopped
and
a
figure
lent
out
from
the
window
beckoning
him
frantically
he
ran
up
to
her
suppose
i
want
you
she
asked
advertise
he
said
promptly
beginning
your
advertisement
i
shall
put
she
said
indignantly
then
i
shall
take
no
notice
of
your
advertisement
he
replied
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
street
his
hat
in
his
hand
to
the
intense
annoyance
of
a
driver
who
literally
all
but
ran
him
down
and
in
a
figurative
sense
did
so
until
was
out
of
earshot
chapter
xvii
thomas
xavier
meredith
was
a
shrewd
young
man
it
was
said
of
him
by
signor
paulo
coselli
the
eminent
criminologist
that
he
had
a
gift
of
intuition
which
was
abnormal
probably
the
mystery
of
the
twisted
candle
was
solved
by
him
long
before
any
other
person
in
the
world
had
the
dimmest
idea
that
it
was
capable
of
solution
the
house
in
cadogan
square
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
police
to
this
house
and
particularly
to
kara
bedroom
from
time
to
time
repaired
and
reproduced
as
far
as
possible
the
conditions
which
obtained
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
had
the
same
stifling
fire
the
same
locked
door
the
latch
was
dropped
in
its
socket
whilst
with
a
stop
watch
in
his
hand
made
elaborate
calculations
and
acted
certain
parts
which
he
did
not
reveal
to
a
soul
three
times
accompanied
by
mansus
he
went
to
the
house
three
times
went
to
the
death
chamber
and
was
alone
on
one
occasion
for
an
hour
and
a
half
whilst
the
patient
mansus
waited
outside
three
times
he
emerged
looking
graver
on
each
occasion
and
after
the
third
visit
he
called
into
consultation
john
lexman
lexman
had
been
spending
some
time
in
the
country
having
deferred
his
trip
to
the
united
states
this
case
puzzles
me
more
and
more
john
said
troubled
out
of
his
usual
boisterous
self
and
thank
heaven
it
worries
other
people
besides
me
de
mainau
came
over
from
france
the
other
day
and
brought
all
his
best
sleuths
whilst
of
the
new
york
central
office
paid
a
flying
visit
just
to
get
hold
of
the
facts
not
one
of
them
has
given
me
the
real
solution
though
they
all
been
rather
ingenious
gathercole
has
vanished
and
is
probably
on
his
way
to
some
undiscoverable
region
and
our
people
have
not
yet
traced
the
he
should
be
the
easiest
for
you
said
john
lexman
reflectively
why
gathercole
should
go
off
i
ca
understand
continued
according
to
the
story
which
was
told
me
by
fisher
his
last
words
to
kara
were
to
the
effect
that
he
was
expecting
a
cheque
or
that
he
had
received
a
cheque
no
cheque
has
been
presented
or
drawn
and
apparently
gathercole
has
gone
off
without
waiting
for
any
payment
an
examination
of
kara
books
show
nothing
against
the
gathercole
account
save
the
sum
of
pounds
which
was
originally
advanced
and
now
to
upset
all
my
calculations
look
at
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
newspaper
cutting
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
for
they
were
dining
together
at
the
carlton
john
lexman
picked
up
the
slip
and
read
it
was
evidently
from
a
new
york
paper
further
news
has
now
come
to
hand
by
the
antarctic
trading
steamer
cyprus
concerning
the
wreck
of
the
city
of
the
argentine
it
is
believed
that
this
vessel
which
called
at
south
american
ports
lost
her
propellor
and
drifted
south
out
of
the
track
of
shipping
this
theory
is
now
confirmed
apparently
the
ship
struck
an
iceberg
on
december
and
foundered
with
all
aboard
save
a
few
men
who
were
able
to
launch
a
boat
and
who
were
picked
up
by
the
cyprus
the
following
is
the
passenger
john
lexman
ran
down
the
list
until
he
came
upon
the
name
which
was
evidently
underlined
in
ink
by
x
that
name
was
george
gathercole
and
after
it
in
brackets
explorer
if
that
were
true
then
gathercole
could
not
have
come
to
he
may
have
taken
another
boat
said
and
i
cabled
to
the
steamship
company
without
any
great
success
apparently
gathercole
was
an
eccentric
sort
of
man
and
lived
in
terror
of
being
overcrowded
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
make
provisional
bookings
by
every
available
steamer
the
company
can
tell
me
no
more
than
that
he
had
booked
but
whether
he
shipped
on
the
city
of
the
argentine
or
not
they
do
not
i
can
tell
you
this
about
gathercole
said
john
slowly
and
thoughtfully
that
he
was
a
man
who
would
not
hurt
a
fly
he
was
incapable
of
killing
any
man
being
constitutionally
averse
to
taking
life
in
any
shape
for
this
reason
he
never
made
collections
of
butterflies
or
of
bees
and
i
believe
has
never
shot
an
animal
in
his
life
he
carried
his
principles
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
a
vegetarian
poor
old
gathercole
he
said
with
the
first
smile
which
had
seen
on
his
face
since
he
came
back
if
you
want
to
sympathize
with
anybody
said
gloomily
sympathize
with
on
the
following
day
was
summoned
to
the
home
office
and
went
steeled
for
a
most
unholy
row
the
home
secretary
a
large
and
worthy
gentleman
given
to
the
making
of
speeches
on
every
excuse
received
him
however
with
unusual
kindness
i
sent
for
you
meredith
he
said
about
this
unfortunate
greek
i
had
all
his
private
papers
looked
into
and
translated
and
in
some
cases
decoded
because
as
you
are
probably
aware
his
diaries
and
a
great
deal
of
his
correspondence
were
in
a
code
which
called
for
the
attention
of
had
not
troubled
himself
greatly
about
kara
private
papers
but
had
handed
them
over
in
accordance
with
instructions
to
the
proper
authorities
of
course
meredith
the
home
secretary
went
on
beaming
across
his
big
table
we
expect
you
to
continue
your
search
for
the
murderer
but
i
must
confess
that
your
prisoner
when
you
secure
him
will
have
a
very
excellent
case
to
put
to
a
that
i
can
well
believe
sir
said
x
seldom
in
my
long
career
at
the
bar
began
the
home
secretary
in
his
best
oratorical
manner
have
i
examined
a
record
so
utterly
discreditable
as
that
of
the
deceased
here
he
advanced
a
few
instances
which
surprised
even
x
the
man
was
a
lunatic
continued
the
home
secretary
a
vicious
evil
man
who
loved
cruelty
for
cruelty
sake
we
have
in
this
diary
alone
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
him
of
three
separate
murders
one
of
which
was
committed
in
this
looked
his
astonishment
you
will
remember
meredith
as
i
saw
in
one
of
your
reports
that
he
had
a
chauffeur
a
greek
named
nodded
he
went
to
greece
on
the
day
following
the
shooting
of
vassalaro
he
said
the
home
secretary
shook
his
head
he
was
killed
on
the
same
night
said
the
minister
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
what
remains
of
his
body
in
the
disused
house
which
kara
rented
for
his
own
purpose
on
the
portsmouth
road
that
he
has
killed
a
number
of
people
in
albania
you
may
well
suppose
whole
villages
have
been
wiped
out
to
provide
him
with
a
little
excitement
the
man
was
a
nero
without
any
of
nero
amiable
weaknesses
he
was
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
he
himself
was
in
danger
of
assassination
and
saw
an
enemy
even
in
his
trusty
servant
undoubtedly
the
chauffeur
poropulos
was
in
touch
with
several
continental
government
circles
you
understand
said
the
minister
in
conclusion
that
i
am
telling
you
this
not
with
the
idea
of
expecting
you
to
relax
your
efforts
to
find
the
murderer
and
clear
up
the
mystery
but
in
order
that
you
may
know
something
of
the
possible
motive
for
this
man
spent
an
hour
going
over
the
decoded
diary
and
documents
and
left
the
home
office
a
little
shakily
it
was
inconceivable
incredible
kara
was
a
lunatic
but
the
directing
genius
was
a
devil
had
a
flat
in
whitehall
gardens
and
thither
he
repaired
to
change
for
dinner
he
was
half
dressed
when
the
evening
paper
arrived
and
he
glanced
as
was
his
wont
first
at
the
news
page
and
then
at
the
advertisement
column
he
looked
down
the
column
marked
personal
without
expecting
to
find
anything
of
particular
interest
to
himself
but
saw
that
which
made
him
drop
the
paper
and
fly
round
the
room
in
a
frenzy
to
complete
his
toilet
tommy
ran
the
brief
announcement
most
urgent
marble
arch
he
had
five
minutes
to
get
there
but
it
seemed
like
five
hours
he
was
held
up
at
almost
every
crossing
and
though
he
might
have
used
his
authority
to
obtain
right
of
way
it
was
a
step
which
his
curious
sense
of
honesty
prevented
him
taking
he
leapt
out
of
the
cab
before
it
stopped
thrust
the
fare
into
the
driver
hands
and
looked
round
for
the
girl
he
saw
her
at
last
and
walked
quickly
towards
her
as
he
approached
her
she
turned
about
and
with
an
almost
imperceptible
beckoning
gesture
walked
away
he
followed
her
along
the
bayswater
road
and
gradually
drew
level
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
watched
she
said
in
a
low
voice
will
you
call
a
cab
he
hailed
a
passing
taxi
helped
her
in
and
gave
at
random
the
first
place
that
suggested
itself
to
him
which
was
finsbury
park
i
am
very
worried
she
said
and
i
do
know
anybody
who
can
help
me
except
is
it
money
he
asked
money
she
said
scornfully
of
course
it
is
money
i
want
to
show
you
a
letter
she
said
after
a
while
she
took
it
from
her
bag
and
gave
it
to
him
and
he
struck
a
match
and
read
it
with
difficulty
it
was
written
in
a
studiously
uneducated
hand
dear
miss
i
know
who
you
are
you
are
wanted
by
the
police
but
i
will
not
give
you
away
dear
miss
i
am
very
hard
up
and
pounds
will
be
very
useful
to
me
and
i
shall
not
trouble
you
again
dear
miss
put
the
money
on
the
window
sill
of
your
room
i
know
you
sleep
on
the
ground
floor
and
i
will
come
in
and
take
it
and
if
not
well
i
do
want
to
make
any
trouble
yours
truly
a
when
did
you
get
this
he
asked
this
morning
she
replied
i
sent
the
agony
to
the
paper
by
telegram
i
knew
you
would
oh
you
did
did
you
he
said
her
assurance
was
very
pleasing
to
him
the
faith
that
her
words
implied
gave
him
an
odd
little
feeling
of
comfort
and
happiness
i
can
easily
get
you
out
of
this
he
added
give
me
your
address
and
when
the
gentleman
comes
that
is
impossible
she
replied
hurriedly
please
do
think
ungrateful
and
do
think
i
being
silly
you
do
think
i
being
silly
do
you
i
have
never
harboured
such
an
unworthy
thought
he
said
virtuously
yes
you
have
she
persisted
but
really
i
ca
tell
you
where
i
am
living
i
have
a
very
special
reason
for
not
doing
so
it
not
myself
that
i
thinking
about
but
there
a
life
this
was
a
somewhat
dramatic
statement
to
make
and
she
felt
she
had
gone
too
far
perhaps
i
do
mean
that
she
said
but
there
is
some
one
i
care
for
she
dropped
her
voice
oh
said
blankly
he
came
down
from
his
rosy
heights
into
the
shadow
and
darkness
of
a
sunless
valley
some
one
you
care
for
he
repeated
after
a
while
there
was
another
long
silence
then
oh
indeed
said
x
again
the
unbroken
interval
of
quiet
and
after
a
while
she
said
in
a
low
voice
not
that
not
what
way
asked
huskily
his
spirits
doing
a
little
mountaineering
the
way
you
mean
she
said
oh
said
x
he
was
back
again
amidst
the
rosy
snows
of
dawn
was
in
fact
climbing
a
dizzy
escalier
on
the
topmost
height
of
hope
mont
blanc
when
she
pulled
the
ladder
from
under
him
i
shall
of
course
never
marry
she
said
with
a
certain
prim
decision
fell
with
a
dull
sickening
thud
discovering
that
his
rosy
snows
were
not
unlike
cold
hard
ice
in
their
lack
of
resilience
who
said
you
would
he
asked
somewhat
feebly
but
in
self
defence
you
did
she
said
and
her
audacity
took
his
breath
away
well
how
am
i
to
help
you
he
asked
after
a
while
by
giving
me
some
advice
she
said
do
you
think
i
ought
to
put
the
money
there
indeed
i
do
not
said
recovering
some
of
his
natural
dominance
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
would
be
compounding
a
felony
you
would
merely
be
laying
out
trouble
for
yourself
in
the
future
if
he
can
get
pounds
so
easily
he
will
come
for
pounds
but
why
do
you
stay
away
why
do
you
return
home
there
no
charge
and
no
breath
of
suspicion
against
because
i
have
something
to
do
which
i
have
set
my
mind
to
she
said
with
determination
in
her
tones
surely
you
can
trust
me
with
your
address
he
urged
her
after
all
that
has
passed
between
us
belinda
mary
after
all
the
years
we
have
known
one
i
shall
get
out
and
leave
you
she
said
steadily
but
how
the
dickens
am
i
going
to
help
you
he
protested
do
swear
she
could
be
very
severe
indeed
the
only
way
you
can
help
me
is
by
being
kind
and
would
you
like
me
to
burst
into
tears
he
asked
sarcastically
i
ask
you
to
do
nothing
more
painful
or
repugnant
to
your
natural
feelings
than
to
be
a
gentleman
she
said
thank
you
very
kindly
said
and
leant
back
in
the
cab
with
an
air
of
supreme
resignation
i
believe
you
making
faces
in
the
dark
she
accused
him
god
forbid
that
i
should
do
anything
so
low
said
he
hastily
what
made
you
think
that
because
i
was
putting
my
tongue
out
at
you
she
admitted
and
the
taxi
driver
heard
the
shrieks
of
laughter
in
the
cab
behind
him
above
the
wheezing
of
his
asthmatic
engine
at
twelve
that
night
in
a
certain
suburb
of
london
an
overcoated
man
moved
stealthily
through
a
garden
he
felt
his
way
carefully
along
the
wall
of
the
house
and
groped
with
hope
but
with
no
great
certainty
along
the
window
sill
he
found
an
envelope
which
his
fingers
somewhat
sensitive
from
long
employment
in
nefarious
uses
told
him
contained
nothing
more
substantial
than
a
letter
he
went
back
through
the
garden
and
rejoined
his
companion
who
was
waiting
under
an
adjacent
did
she
drop
asked
the
other
eagerly
i
do
know
yet
growled
the
man
from
the
garden
he
opened
the
envelope
and
read
the
few
lines
she
has
got
the
money
he
said
but
she
going
to
get
it
i
must
meet
her
afternoon
at
the
corner
of
oxford
street
and
regent
what
time
asked
the
other
six
said
the
first
man
the
chap
who
takes
the
money
must
carry
a
copy
of
the
westminster
gazette
in
his
oh
then
it
a
plant
said
the
other
with
conviction
the
other
laughed
she
wo
work
any
plants
i
bet
she
scared
out
of
her
the
second
man
bit
his
nails
and
looked
up
and
down
the
road
apprehensively
it
come
to
something
he
said
bitterly
we
went
out
to
make
our
thousands
and
we
come
down
to
for
it
the
luck
said
the
other
philosophically
and
i
have
done
with
her
by
any
means
besides
we
still
got
a
chance
of
pulling
of
the
big
thing
harry
i
reckon
she
good
for
a
hundred
or
two
at
six
on
the
following
afternoon
a
man
dressed
in
a
dark
overcoat
with
a
soft
felt
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
stood
nonchalantly
by
the
curb
near
where
the
buses
stop
at
regent
street
slapping
his
hand
gently
with
a
folded
copy
of
the
westminster
gazette
that
none
should
mistake
his
liberal
reading
he
stood
as
near
as
possible
to
a
street
lamp
and
so
arranged
himself
and
his
attitude
that
the
minimum
of
light
should
fall
upon
his
face
and
the
maximum
upon
that
respectable
organ
of
public
opinion
soon
after
six
he
saw
the
girl
approaching
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
and
strolled
off
to
meet
her
to
his
surprise
she
passed
him
by
and
he
was
turning
to
follow
when
an
unfriendly
hand
gripped
him
by
the
arm
mr
fisher
i
believe
said
a
pleasant
voice
what
do
you
mean
said
the
man
struggling
backward
are
you
going
quietly
asked
the
pleasant
superintendent
mansus
or
shall
i
take
my
stick
to
you
fisher
thought
awhile
it
a
cop
he
confessed
and
allowed
himself
to
be
hustled
into
the
waiting
cab
he
made
his
appearance
in
t
x
office
and
that
urbane
gentleman
greeted
him
as
a
friend
and
how
fisher
he
asked
i
suppose
you
are
fisher
still
and
not
harry
gilcott
or
george
fisher
smiled
his
old
deferential
deprecating
smile
you
will
always
have
your
joke
sir
i
suppose
the
young
lady
gave
me
you
gave
yourself
away
my
poor
fisher
said
and
put
a
strip
of
paper
before
him
you
may
disguise
your
hand
and
in
your
extreme
modesty
pretend
to
an
ignorance
of
the
british
language
which
is
not
creditable
to
your
many
attainments
but
what
you
must
be
awfully
careful
in
doing
in
future
when
you
write
such
epistles
he
said
is
to
wash
your
wash
my
hands
repeated
the
puzzled
fisher
nodded
you
see
you
left
a
little
thumb
print
and
we
are
rather
whales
on
thumb
prints
at
scotland
yard
i
see
what
is
the
charge
now
sir
i
shall
make
no
charge
against
you
except
the
conventional
one
of
being
a
convict
under
license
and
failing
to
fisher
heaved
a
sigh
that
only
mean
twelve
months
are
you
going
to
charge
me
with
this
business
he
nodded
to
the
paper
shook
his
head
i
bear
you
no
although
you
tried
to
frighten
miss
bartholomew
oh
yes
i
know
it
is
miss
bartholomew
and
have
known
all
the
time
the
lady
is
there
for
a
reason
which
is
no
business
of
yours
or
of
mine
i
shall
not
charge
you
with
attempt
to
blackmail
and
in
reward
for
my
leniency
i
hope
you
are
going
to
tell
me
all
you
know
about
the
kara
murder
you
would
like
me
to
charge
you
with
that
would
you
by
any
chance
fisher
drew
a
long
breath
no
sir
but
if
you
did
i
could
prove
my
innocence
he
said
earnestly
i
spent
the
whole
of
the
evening
in
the
except
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
x
the
man
nodded
that
true
sir
i
went
out
to
see
a
pal
of
the
man
who
is
in
this
asked
fisher
hesitated
yes
sir
he
was
with
me
in
this
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
the
business
as
far
as
we
went
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
was
planning
a
big
thing
i
not
going
to
blow
on
it
if
it
going
to
get
me
into
trouble
but
if
you
promise
me
that
it
wo
i
tell
you
the
whole
against
whom
was
this
coup
of
yours
planned
against
kara
sir
said
fisher
go
on
with
your
story
nodded
x
the
story
was
a
short
and
commonplace
one
fisher
had
met
a
man
who
knew
another
man
who
was
either
a
turk
or
an
albanian
they
had
learnt
that
kara
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
large
sums
of
money
in
the
house
and
they
had
planned
to
rob
him
that
was
the
story
in
a
nutshell
somewhere
the
plan
miscarried
it
was
when
he
came
to
the
incidents
that
occurred
on
the
night
of
the
murder
that
followed
him
with
the
greatest
interest
the
old
gentleman
came
in
said
fisher
and
i
saw
him
up
to
the
room
i
heard
him
coming
out
and
i
went
up
and
spoke
to
him
while
he
was
having
a
chat
with
kara
at
the
open
did
you
hear
kara
speak
i
fancy
i
did
sir
said
fisher
anyway
the
old
gentleman
was
quite
pleased
with
why
do
you
say
gentleman
asked
he
was
not
an
old
not
exactly
sir
said
fisher
but
he
had
a
sort
of
fussy
irritable
way
that
old
gentlemen
sometimes
have
and
i
somehow
got
it
fixed
in
my
mind
that
he
was
old
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
about
he
may
have
been
you
have
told
me
all
this
before
was
there
anything
peculiar
about
him
fisher
hesitated
nothing
sir
except
the
fact
that
one
of
his
arms
was
a
game
meaning
that
it
was
meaning
that
it
was
an
artificial
one
sir
so
far
as
i
can
make
was
it
his
right
or
his
left
arm
that
was
game
interrupted
x
his
left
arm
you
sure
i
swear
to
it
very
well
go
he
came
downstairs
and
went
out
and
i
never
saw
him
again
when
you
came
and
the
murder
was
discovered
and
knowing
as
i
did
that
i
had
my
own
scheme
on
and
that
one
of
your
splits
might
pinch
me
i
got
a
bit
rattled
i
went
downstairs
to
the
hall
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
lying
on
the
table
was
a
letter
it
was
addressed
to
he
paused
and
nodded
go
on
he
said
again
i
could
understand
how
it
came
to
be
there
but
as
i
been
in
the
kitchen
most
of
the
evening
except
when
i
was
seeing
my
pal
outside
to
tell
him
the
job
was
off
for
that
night
it
might
have
been
there
before
you
came
i
opened
the
letter
there
were
only
a
few
words
on
it
and
i
can
tell
you
those
few
words
made
my
heart
jump
up
into
my
mouth
and
made
me
go
cold
all
what
were
they
asked
x
i
shall
not
forget
them
sir
they
sort
of
permanently
fixed
in
my
brain
said
the
man
earnestly
the
note
started
with
just
the
figures
c
what
was
that
asked
x
my
convict
number
when
i
was
in
dartmoor
prison
what
did
the
note
say
out
of
here
quick
i
do
know
who
had
put
it
there
but
evidently
been
spotted
and
i
was
taking
no
chances
that
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
i
accidentally
happened
to
meet
the
young
lady
miss
holland
miss
bartholomew
as
she
is
and
followed
her
to
her
house
in
portman
place
that
was
the
night
you
were
found
himself
to
his
intense
annoyance
going
very
red
and
you
know
no
more
he
asked
no
more
sir
and
if
i
may
be
struck
dead
keep
all
that
sabbath
talk
for
the
chaplain
commended
and
they
took
away
fisher
not
an
especially
dissatisfied
man
that
night
interviewed
his
prisoner
at
cannon
row
police
station
and
made
a
few
more
enquiries
there
is
one
thing
i
would
like
to
ask
you
said
the
girl
when
he
met
her
next
morning
in
green
park
if
you
were
going
to
ask
whether
i
made
enquiries
as
to
where
your
habitation
was
he
warned
her
i
beg
of
you
to
she
was
looking
very
beautiful
that
morning
he
thought
the
keen
air
had
brought
a
colour
to
her
face
and
lent
a
spring
to
her
gait
and
as
she
strode
along
by
his
side
with
the
free
and
careless
swing
of
youth
she
was
an
epitome
of
the
life
which
even
now
was
budding
on
every
tree
in
the
park
your
father
is
back
in
town
by
the
way
he
said
and
he
is
most
anxious
to
see
she
made
a
little
grimace
i
hope
you
have
been
round
talking
to
father
about
of
course
i
have
he
said
helplessly
i
have
also
had
all
the
reporters
up
from
fleet
street
and
given
them
a
full
description
of
your
she
looked
round
at
him
with
laughter
in
her
eyes
you
have
all
the
manners
of
an
early
christian
martyr
she
said
poor
soul
would
you
like
to
be
thrown
to
the
lions
i
should
prefer
being
thrown
to
the
demnition
ducks
and
drakes
he
said
moodily
you
such
a
miserable
man
she
chided
him
and
yet
you
have
everything
to
make
life
worth
ha
ha
said
x
you
have
of
course
you
have
you
have
a
splendid
position
everybody
looks
up
to
you
and
talks
about
you
you
have
got
a
wife
and
family
who
adore
you
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
as
though
she
were
some
strange
insect
i
have
a
how
much
he
asked
credulously
are
you
married
she
asked
innocently
he
made
a
strange
noise
in
his
throat
do
you
know
i
have
always
thought
of
you
as
married
she
went
on
i
often
picture
you
in
your
domestic
circle
reading
to
the
children
from
the
daily
megaphone
those
awfully
interesting
stories
about
little
willie
he
held
on
to
the
railings
for
support
may
we
sit
down
he
asked
faintly
she
sat
by
his
side
half
turned
to
him
demure
and
wholly
adorable
of
course
you
are
right
in
one
respect
he
said
at
last
but
altogether
wrong
about
the
are
you
married
she
demanded
with
no
evidence
of
amusement
did
you
know
he
asked
she
swallowed
something
of
course
it
no
business
of
mine
and
i
sure
i
hope
you
are
very
perfectly
happy
said
complacently
you
must
come
out
and
see
me
one
saturday
afternoon
when
i
am
digging
the
potatoes
i
am
a
perfect
devil
when
they
let
me
loose
in
the
vegetable
shall
we
go
on
she
said
he
could
have
sworn
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
manlike
he
thought
she
was
vexed
with
him
at
his
fooling
i
have
made
you
cross
have
i
he
asked
oh
no
she
replied
i
mean
you
do
believe
all
this
rot
about
my
being
married
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
not
interested
she
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
not
very
much
you
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
should
be
an
awful
boor
if
i
was
grateful
of
course
i
do
care
whether
you
married
or
not
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
is
it
naturally
it
is
he
replied
i
suppose
you
are
married
by
any
chance
married
she
repeated
bitterly
why
you
will
make
my
fourth
she
had
hardy
got
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
before
she
realized
her
terrible
error
a
second
later
she
was
in
his
arms
and
he
was
kissing
her
to
the
scandal
of
one
aged
park
keeper
one
small
and
little
boy
and
a
moulting
duck
who
seemed
to
sneer
at
the
proceedings
which
he
watched
through
a
yellow
and
malignant
eye
belinda
mary
said
at
parting
you
have
got
to
give
up
your
little
country
establishment
wherever
it
may
be
and
come
back
to
the
discomforts
of
portman
place
oh
i
know
you
ca
come
back
yet
that
is
there
and
i
can
pretty
well
guess
who
it
who
she
challenged
i
rather
fancy
your
mother
has
come
back
he
suggested
a
look
of
scorn
dawned
into
her
pretty
face
good
lord
tommy
she
said
in
disgust
you
do
think
i
should
keep
mother
in
the
suburbs
without
her
telling
the
world
all
about
it
you
an
undutiful
little
beggar
he
said
they
had
reached
the
horse
guards
at
whitehall
and
he
was
saying
to
her
if
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
duty
she
answered
perhaps
you
will
do
your
duty
and
hold
up
the
traffic
for
me
and
let
me
cross
this
my
dear
girl
he
protested
hold
up
the
traffic
of
course
she
said
indignantly
you
a
only
when
i
am
in
uniform
he
said
hastily
and
piloted
her
across
the
road
it
was
a
new
man
who
returned
to
the
gloomy
office
in
whitehall
a
man
with
a
heart
that
swelled
and
throbbed
with
the
pride
and
joy
of
most
precious
possession
chapter
xviii
sat
at
his
desk
his
chin
in
his
hands
his
mind
remarkably
busy
grave
as
the
matter
was
which
he
was
considering
he
rose
with
alacrity
to
meet
the
smiling
girl
who
was
ushered
through
the
door
by
mansus
preternaturally
solemn
and
mysterious
she
was
radiant
that
day
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
an
unusual
brightness
i
got
the
most
wonderful
thing
to
tell
you
she
said
and
i
tell
that
a
very
good
beginning
said
taking
her
muff
from
her
hand
oh
but
it
really
wonderful
she
cried
eagerly
more
wonderful
than
anything
you
have
ever
heard
we
are
interested
said
blandly
no
no
you
must
make
fun
she
begged
i
ca
tell
you
now
but
it
is
something
that
will
make
you
simply
she
was
at
a
loss
for
a
simile
jump
out
of
my
skin
suggested
x
i
shall
astonish
you
she
nodded
her
head
solemnly
i
take
a
lot
of
astonishing
i
warn
you
he
smiled
to
know
you
is
to
exhaust
one
capacity
for
that
can
be
either
very
very
nice
or
very
very
nasty
she
said
cautiously
but
accept
it
as
being
very
very
nice
he
laughed
now
come
out
with
this
tale
of
she
shook
her
head
very
vigorously
i
ca
possibly
tell
you
anything
she
said
then
why
the
dickens
do
you
begin
telling
anything
for
he
complained
not
without
reason
because
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
do
know
oh
lord
he
groaned
of
course
you
know
everything
belinda
mary
you
really
the
most
wonderful
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
you
come
to
take
me
out
to
lunch
what
were
you
worrying
about
when
i
came
in
she
asked
he
made
a
little
gesture
as
if
to
dismiss
the
subject
nothing
very
much
you
heard
me
speak
of
john
lexman
she
bent
her
head
lexman
the
writer
of
a
great
many
mystery
stories
but
probably
read
his
she
nodded
again
and
again
noticed
the
suppressed
eagerness
in
her
eyes
you
not
ill
or
sickening
for
anything
are
you
he
asked
anxiously
measles
or
mumps
or
something
do
be
silly
she
said
go
on
and
tell
me
something
about
he
going
to
america
said
and
before
he
goes
he
wants
to
give
a
little
a
lecture
it
sounds
rum
does
it
but
that
just
what
he
wants
to
why
is
he
doing
it
she
asked
made
a
gesture
of
despair
that
is
one
of
the
mysteries
which
may
never
be
revealed
to
me
except
he
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
girl
there
are
times
he
said
when
there
is
a
great
struggle
going
on
inside
a
man
between
all
the
human
and
better
part
of
him
and
the
baser
professional
part
of
him
one
side
of
me
wants
to
hear
this
lecture
of
john
lexman
very
much
the
other
shrinks
from
the
let
us
talk
it
over
at
lunch
she
said
practically
and
carried
him
off
chapter

one
would
not
readily
associate
the
party
of
sewermen
who
descend
nightly
to
the
subterranean
passages
of
london
with
the
stout
viceconsul
at
durazzo
yet
it
was
one
unimaginative
man
who
lived
in
lambeth
and
had
no
knowledge
that
there
was
such
a
place
as
durazzo
who
was
responsible
for
bringing
this
comfortable
official
out
of
his
bed
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
causing
him
albeit
reluctantly
and
with
violent
and
insubordinate
language
to
conduct
certain
investigations
in
the
crowded
bazaars
at
first
he
was
unsuccessful
because
there
were
many

in
durazzo

sent
an
invitation
to
the
american
consul
to
come
over
to
tiffin
and
help
him
why
the
dickens
the
foreign
office
should
suddenly
be
interested
in
hussein

i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
the
foreign
department
has
to
be
interested
in
something
you
know
said
the
genial
american
i
receive
some
of
the
quaintest
requests
from
washington
i
rather
fancy
they
only
wire
you
to
find
if
they
are
why
are
you
doing
this
i
seen
hakaat
bey
said
the
english
official
i
wonder
what
this
fellow
has
been
doing
there
is
probably
a
wigging
for
me
in
the
at
about
the
same
time
the
sewerman
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
was
taking
loud
and
noisy
sips
from
a
big
mug
of
tea
do
you
be
surprised
he
said
to
his
admiring
better
half
if
i
have
to
go
up
to
the
old
bailey
to
give
lord
joe
she
said
with
interest
what
has
happened
the
sewer
man
filled
his
pipe
and
told
the
story
with
a
wealth
of
rambling
detail
he
gave
particulars
of
the
hour
he
had
descended
the
victoria
street
shaft
of
what
bill
morgan
had
said
to
him
as
they
were
going
down
of
what
he
had
said
to
harry
carter
as
they
splashed
along
the
tunnel
of
how
he
had
a
funny
feeling
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
discovery
and
so
on
and
so
forth
until
he
reached
his
long
delayed
climax
waited
up
very
late
that
night
and
at
twelve
his
patience
was
rewarded
for
the
foreign

messenger
brought
a

he
received
a
further
telephone
report
from

the
next
morning
and
one
which
gave
him
infinite
satisfaction
very
slowly
but
surely
he
was
gathering
together
the
pieces
of
this
baffling
mystery

was
fitting
them
together

night
the

opened
and
the
man
who

came
in
carrying
a

on
his

gave
him
a
nod

then
as

with

waiting
for

to

said

him
in
i
will
see
him
there
walked
into
his
office
a
tall
man
wearing
a
frock
coat
and
a
red
fez
he
was
a
man
from
to
sixty
powerfully
built
with
a
grave
dark
face
and
a
thin
fringe
of
white
beard
he
salaamed
as
he
entered
you
speak
french
i
believe
said
presently
the
other
bowed
my
agent
has
explained
to
you
said
in
french
that
i
desire
some
information
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
up
a
crime
which
has
been
committed
in
this
country
i
have
given
you
my
assurance
if
that
assurance
was
necessary
that
you
would
come
to
no
harm
as
a
result
of
anything
you
might
tell
that
i
understand
effendi
said
the
tall
turk
the
americans
and
the
english
have
always
been
good
friends
of
mine
and
i
have
been
frequently
in
london
therefore
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
be
of
any
help
to
walked
to
a
closed
bookcase
on
one
side
of
the
room
unlocked
it
took
out
an
object
wrapped
in
white
tissue
paper
he
laid
this
on
the
table
the
turk
watching
the
proceedings
with
an
impassive
face
very
slowly
the
commissioner
unrolled
the
little
bundle
and
revealed
at
last
a
long
slim
knife
rusted
and
stained
with
a
hilt
which
in
its
untarnished
days
had
evidently
been
of
chased
silver
he
lifted
the
dagger
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
the
turk
this
is
yours
i
believe
he
said
softly
the
man
turned
it
over
stepping
nearer
the
table
that
he
might
secure
the
advantage
of
a
better
light
he
examined
the
blade
near
the
hilt
and
handed
the
weapon
back
to
x
that
is
my
knife
he
said
smiled
you
understand
of
course
that
i
saw
effendi
of
inscribed
in
arabic
near
the
the
turk
inclined
his
head
with
this
weapon
went
on
speaking
with
slow
emphasis
a
murder
was
committed
in
this
there
was
no
sign
of
interest
or
astonishment
or
indeed
of
any
emotion
whatever
it
is
the
will
of
god
he
said
calmly
these
things
happen
even
in
a
great
city
like
it
was
your
knife
suggested
x
but
my
hand
was
in
durazzo
effendi
said
the
turk
he
looked
at
the
knife
again
so
the
black
roman
is
dead
the
black
roman
asked
a
little
puzzled
the
greek
they
call
kara
said
the
turk
he
was
a
very
wicked
was
up
on
his
feet
now
leaning
across
the
table
and
looking
at
the
other
with
narrowed
eyes
how
did
you
know
it
was
kara
he
asked
quickly
the
turk
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
else
could
it
be
he
said
are
not
your
newspapers
filled
with
the
story
sat
back
again
disappointed
and
a
little
annoyed
with
himself
that
is
true
hussein
effendi
but
i
did
not
think
you
read
the
neither
do
i
master
replied
the
other
coolly
nor
did
i
know
that
kara
had
been
killed
until
i
saw
this
knife
how
came
this
in
your
possession
it
was
found
in
a
rain
sewer
said
into
which
the
murderer
had
apparently
dropped
it
but
if
you
have
not
read
the
newspapers
effendi
then
you
admit
that
you
know
who
committed
this
the
turk
raised
his
hands
slowly
to
a
level
with
his
shoulders
though
i
am
a
christian
he
said
there
are
many
wise
sayings
of
my
father
religion
which
i
remember
and
one
of
these
effendi
was
wicked
must
die
in
the
habitations
of
the
just
by
the
weapons
of
the
worthy
shall
the
wicked
perish
your
excellency
i
am
a
worthy
man
for
never
have
i
done
a
dishonest
thing
in
my
life
i
have
traded
fairly
with
greeks
with
italians
have
with
frenchmen
and
with
englishmen
also
with
jews
i
have
never
sought
to
rob
them
nor
to
hurt
them
if
i
have
killed
men
god
knows
it
was
not
because
i
desired
their
death
but
because
their
lives
were
dangerous
to
me
and
to
mine
ask
the
blade
all
your
questions
and
see
what
answer
it
gives
until
it
speaks
i
am
as
dumb
as
the
blade
for
it
is
also
written
that
soldier
is
the
servant
of
his
sword
and
also
wise
servant
is
dumb
about
his
master
affairs
laughed
helplessly
i
had
hoped
that
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
hoped
and
feared
he
said
if
you
can
not
speak
it
is
not
my
business
to
force
you
either
by
threat
or
by
act
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
having
come
over
although
the
visit
has
been
rather
fruitless
so
far
as
i
am
he
smiled
again
and
offered
his
hand
excellency
said
the
old
turk
soberly
there
are
some
things
in
life
that
are
well
left
alone
and
there
are
moments
when
justice
should
be
so
blind
that
she
does
not
see
guilt
here
is
such
a
and
this
ended
the
interview
one
on
which
had
set
very
high
hopes
his
gloom
carried
to
portman
place
where
he
had
arranged
to
meet
belinda
mary
where
is
lexman
going
to
give
this
famous
lecture
of
his
was
the
question
with
which
she
greeted
him
and
please
what
is
the
subject
it
is
on
a
subject
which
is
of
supreme
interest
to
me
he
said
gravely
he
has
called
his
lecture
clue
of
the
twisted
candle
there
is
no
clearer
brain
being
employed
in
the
business
of
criminal
detection
than
john
lexman
though
he
uses
his
genius
for
the
construction
of
stories
were
it
employed
in
the
legitimate
business
of
police
work
i
am
certain
he
would
make
a
mark
second
to
none
in
the
world
he
is
determined
on
giving
this
lecture
and
he
has
issued
a
number
of
invitations
these
include
the
chiefs
of
the
secret
police
of
nearly
all
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
is
on
his
way
from
america
he
wirelessed
me
this
morning
to
that
effect
even
the
chief
of
the
russian
police
has
accepted
the
invitation
because
as
you
know
this
murder
has
excited
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
police
circles
everywhere
john
lexman
is
not
only
going
to
deliver
this
lecture
he
said
slowly
but
he
is
going
to
tell
us
who
committed
the
murder
and
how
it
was
she
thought
a
moment
where
will
it
be
delivered
i
do
know
he
said
in
astonishment
does
that
matter
it
matters
a
great
deal
she
said
emphatically
especially
if
i
want
it
delivered
in
a
certain
place
would
you
induce
lexman
to
lecture
at
my
house
at
portman
place
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
no
i
have
a
house
of
my
own
a
furnished
house
i
have
rented
at
blackheath
will
you
induce
lexman
to
give
the
lecture
there
but
why
he
asked
please
do
ask
questions
she
pleaded
do
this
for
me
he
saw
she
was
in
earnest
i
write
to
old
lexman
this
afternoon
he
promised
john
lexman
telephoned
his
reply
i
should
prefer
somewhere
out
of
london
he
said
and
since
miss
bartholomew
has
some
interest
in
the
matter
may
i
extend
my
invitation
to
her
i
promise
she
shall
not
be
any
more
shocked
than
a
good
woman
need
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
name
of
belinda
mary
bartholomew
was
added
to
the
selected
list
of
police
chiefs
who
were
making
for
london
at
that
moment
to
hear
from
the
man
who
had
guaranteed
the
solution
of
the
story
of
kara
and
his
killing
the
unravelment
of
the
mystery
which
surrounded
his
death
and
the
significance
of
the
twisted
candles
which
at
that
moment
were
reposing
in
the
black
museum
at
scotland
yard
chapter
xx
the
room
was
a
big
one
and
most
of
the
furniture
had
been
cleared
out
to
admit
the
guests
who
had
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
learn
the
story
of
the
twisted
candles
and
to
test
john
lexman
theory
by
their
own
they
sat
around
chatting
cheerfully
of
men
and
crimes
of
great
coups
planned
and
frustrated
of
strange
deeds
committed
and
undetected
scraps
of
their
conversation
came
to
belinda
mary
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
which
led
from
the
to
the
room
she
used
as
a
study
do
you
remember
sir
george
the
bolbrook
case
i
took
the
man
at
odessa
the
curious
thing
was
that
i
found
no
money
on
the
body
only
a
small
gold
charm
set
with
a
single
emerald
so
i
knew
it
was
the
girl
with
the
fur
bonnet
who
had
pinot
got
away
after
putting
three
bullets
into
me
but
i
dragged
myself
to
the
window
and
shot
him
dead
it
was
a
real
good
shot
they
rose
to
meet
her
and
introduced
her
to
the
men
it
was
at
that
moment
that
john
lexman
was
announced
he
looked
tired
but
returned
the
commissioner
greeting
with
a
cheerful
mien
he
knew
all
the
men
present
by
name
as
they
knew
him
he
had
a
few
sheets
of
notes
which
he
laid
on
the
little
table
which
had
been
placed
for
him
and
when
the
introductions
were
finished
he
went
to
this
and
with
scarcely
any
preliminary
began
chapter
xxi
the
narrative
of
john
lexman
i
am
as
you
may
all
know
a
writer
of
stories
which
depend
for
their
success
upon
the
creation
and
unravelment
of
criminological
mysteries
the
chief
commissioner
has
been
good
enough
to
tell
you
that
my
stories
were
something
more
than
a
mere
seeking
after
sensation
and
that
i
endeavoured
in
the
course
of
those
narratives
to
propound
obscure
but
possible
situations
and
with
the
ingenuity
that
i
could
command
to
offer
to
those
problems
a
solution
acceptable
not
only
to
the
general
reader
but
to
the
police
expert
although
i
did
not
regard
my
earlier
work
with
any
great
seriousness
and
indeed
only
sought
after
exciting
situations
and
incidents
i
can
see
now
looking
back
that
underneath
the
work
which
seemed
at
the
time
purposeless
there
was
something
very
much
like
a
scheme
of
studies
you
must
forgive
this
egotism
in
me
because
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
make
this
explanation
and
you
who
are
in
the
main
police
officers
of
considerable
experience
and
discernment
should
appreciate
the
fact
that
as
i
was
able
to
get
inside
the
minds
of
the
fictitious
criminals
i
portrayed
so
am
i
now
able
to
follow
the
mind
of
the
man
who
committed
this
murder
or
if
not
to
follow
his
mind
to
recreate
the
psychology
of
the
slayer
of
remington
kara
in
the
possession
of
most
of
you
are
the
vital
facts
concerning
this
man
you
know
the
type
of
man
he
was
you
have
instances
of
his
terrible
ruthlessness
you
know
that
he
was
a
blot
upon
god
earth
a
vicious
wicked
ego
seeking
the
gratification
of
that
strange
and
which
is
to
be
found
in
so
few
john
lexman
went
on
to
describe
the
killing
of
vassalaro
i
know
now
how
that
occurred
he
said
i
had
received
on
the
previous
christmas
eve
amongst
other
presents
a
pistol
from
an
unknown
admirer
that
unknown
admirer
was
kara
who
had
planned
this
murder
some
three
months
ahead
he
it
was
who
sent
me
the
browning
knowing
as
he
did
that
i
had
never
used
such
a
weapon
and
that
therefore
i
would
be
chary
about
using
it
i
might
have
put
the
pistol
away
in
a
cupboard
out
of
reach
and
the
whole
of
his
carefully
thought
out
plan
would
have
miscarried
but
kara
was
systematic
in
all
things
three
weeks
after
i
received
the
weapon
a
clumsy
attempt
was
made
to
break
into
my
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
struck
me
at
the
time
it
was
clumsy
because
the
burglar
made
a
tremendous
amount
of
noise
and
disappeared
soon
after
he
began
his
attempt
doing
no
more
damage
than
to
break
a
window
in
my
naturally
my
mind
went
to
the
possibility
of
a
further
attempt
of
this
kind
as
my
house
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
it
was
only
natural
that
i
should
take
the
pistol
from
one
of
my
boxes
and
put
it
somewhere
handy
to
make
doubly
sure
kara
came
down
the
next
day
and
heard
the
full
story
of
the
outrage
he
did
not
speak
of
pistols
but
i
remember
now
though
i
did
not
remember
at
the
time
that
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
i
had
a
handy
weapon
a
fortnight
later
a
second
attempt
was
made
to
enter
the
house
i
say
an
attempt
but
again
i
do
not
believe
that
the
intention
was
at
all
serious
the
outrage
was
designed
to
keep
that
pistol
of
mine
in
a
place
and
again
kara
came
down
to
see
us
on
the
day
following
the
burglary
and
again
i
must
have
told
him
though
i
have
no
distinct
recollection
of
the
fact
of
what
had
happened
the
previous
night
it
would
have
been
unnatural
if
i
had
not
mentioned
the
fact
as
it
was
a
matter
which
had
formed
a
subject
of
discussion
between
myself
my
wife
and
the
servants
then
came
the
threatening
letter
with
kara
providentially
at
hand
on
the
night
of
the
murder
whilst
kara
was
still
in
my
house
i
went
out
to
find
his
chauffeur
kara
remained
a
few
minutes
with
my
wife
and
then
on
some
excuse
went
into
the
library
there
he
loaded
the
pistol
placing
one
cartridge
in
the
chamber
and
trusting
to
luck
that
i
did
not
pull
the
trigger
until
i
had
it
pointed
at
my
victim
here
he
took
his
biggest
chance
because
before
sending
the
weapon
to
me
he
had
had
the
spring
of
the
browning
so
eased
that
the
slightest
touch
set
it
off
and
as
you
know
the
pistol
being
automatic
the
explosion
of
one
cartridge
reloading
and
firing
the
next
and
so
on
it
was
probably
that
a
chance
touch
would
have
brought
his
scheme
to
nought
probably
me
also
of
what
happened
on
that
night
you
are
he
went
on
to
tell
of
his
trial
and
conviction
and
skimmed
over
the
life
he
led
until
that
morning
on
dartmoor
kara
knew
my
innocence
had
been
proved
and
his
hatred
for
me
being
his
great
obsession
since
i
had
the
thing
he
had
wanted
but
no
longer
wanted
let
that
be
understood
he
saw
the
misery
he
had
planned
for
me
and
my
dear
wife
being
brought
to
a
sudden
end
he
had
by
the
way
already
planned
and
carried
his
plan
into
execution
a
system
of
tormenting
her
you
did
not
know
he
turned
to
that
scarcely
a
month
passed
but
some
disreputable
villain
called
at
her
flat
with
a
story
that
he
had
been
released
from
portland
or
wormwood
scrubbs
that
morning
and
that
he
had
seen
me
the
story
each
messenger
brought
was
one
sufficient
to
break
the
heart
of
any
but
the
bravest
woman
it
was
a
story
of
by
brutal
officials
of
my
illness
of
my
madness
of
everything
calculated
to
harrow
the
feelings
of
a
and
faithful
wife
that
was
kara
scheme
not
to
hurt
with
the
whip
or
with
the
knife
but
to
cut
deep
at
the
heart
with
his
evil
tongue
to
cut
to
the
raw
places
of
the
mind
when
he
found
that
i
was
to
be
released
he
may
have
guessed
or
he
may
have
discovered
by
some
underhand
method
that
a
pardon
was
about
to
be
signed
he
conceived
his
great
plan
he
had
less
than
two
days
to
execute
it
through
one
of
his
agents
he
discovered
a
warder
who
had
been
in
some
trouble
with
the
authorities
a
man
who
was
avaricious
and
was
even
then
on
the
brink
of
being
discharged
from
the
service
for
trafficking
with
prisoners
the
bribe
he
offered
this
man
was
a
heavy
one
and
the
warder
accepted
kara
had
purchased
a
new
monoplane
and
as
you
know
he
was
an
excellent
aviator
with
this
new
machine
he
flew
to
devon
and
arrived
at
dawn
in
one
of
the
unfrequented
parts
of
the
moor
the
story
of
my
own
escape
needs
no
telling
my
narrative
really
begins
from
the
moment
i
put
my
foot
upon
the
deck
of
the
mpret
the
first
person
i
asked
to
see
was
naturally
my
wife
kara
however
insisted
on
my
going
to
the
cabin
he
had
prepared
and
changing
my
clothes
and
until
then
i
did
not
realise
i
was
still
in
my
convict
garb
a
clean
change
was
waiting
for
me
and
the
luxury
of
soft
shirts
and
garments
after
the
prison
uniform
i
can
not
describe
after
i
was
dressed
i
was
taken
by
the
greek
steward
to
the
larger
stateroom
and
there
i
found
my
darling
waiting
for
his
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
and
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
he
had
mastered
his
emotions
she
had
been
suspicious
of
kara
but
he
had
been
very
insistent
he
had
detailed
the
plans
and
shown
her
the
monoplane
but
even
then
she
would
not
trust
herself
on
board
and
she
had
been
waiting
in
a
moving
parallel
with
the
yacht
until
she
saw
the
landing
and
realized
as
she
thought
that
kara
was
not
playing
her
false
the
had
been
hired
by
kara
and
the
two
men
inside
were
probably
as
as
the
warder
the
joy
of
freedom
can
only
be
known
to
those
who
have
suffered
the
horrors
of
restraint
that
is
a
trite
enough
statement
but
when
one
is
describing
elemental
things
there
is
no
room
for
subtlety
the
voyage
was
a
fairly
eventless
one
we
saw
very
little
of
kara
who
did
not
intrude
himself
upon
us
and
our
main
excitement
lay
in
the
apprehension
that
we
should
be
held
up
by
a
british
destroyer
or
that
when
we
reached
gibraltar
we
should
be
searched
by
the
brit
authorities
kara
had
foreseen
that
possibility
and
had
taken
in
enough
coal
to
last
him
for
the
run
we
had
a
fairly
stormy
passage
in
the
mediterranean
but
after
that
nothing
happened
until
we
arrived
at
durazzo
we
had
to
go
ashore
in
disguise
because
kara
told
us
that
the
english
consul
might
see
us
and
make
some
trouble
we
wore
turkish
dresses
grace
heavily
veiled
and
i
wearing
a
greasy
old
kaftan
which
with
my
somewhat
emaciated
face
and
my
unshaven
appearance
passed
me
without
comment
kara
home
was
and
is
about
eighteen
miles
from
durazzo
it
is
not
on
the
main
road
but
it
is
reached
by
following
one
of
the
rocky
mountain
paths
which
wind
and
twist
among
the
hills
to
the
of
the
town
the
country
is
wild
and
mainly
uncultivated
we
had
to
pass
through
swamps
and
skirt
huge
lagoons
as
we
mounted
higher
and
higher
from
terrace
to
terrace
and
came
to
the
roads
which
crossed
the
mountains
kara
palace
you
could
call
it
no
less
is
really
built
within
sight
of
the
sea
it
is
on
the
acroceraunian
peninsula
near
cape
linguetta
hereabouts
the
country
is
more
populated
and
better
cultivated
we
passed
great
slopes
entirely
covered
with
mulberry
and
olive
trees
whilst
in
the
valleys
there
were
fields
of
maize
and
corn
the
palazzo
stands
on
a
lofty
plateau
it
is
approached
by
two
paths
which
can
be
and
have
been
well
defended
in
the
past
against
the
sultan
troops
or
against
the
bands
which
have
been
raised
by
rival
villages
with
the
object
of
storming
and
plundering
this
stronghold
the
skipetars
a
crowd
without
pity
or
remorse
were
faithful
enough
to
their
chief
as
kara
was
he
paid
them
so
well
that
it
was
not
profitable
to
rob
him
moreover
he
kept
their
own
turbulent
elements
fully
occupied
with
the
little
raids
which
he
or
his
agents
organized
from
time
to
time
the
palazzo
was
built
rather
in
the
moorish
than
in
the
turkish
style
it
was
a
sort
of
eastern
type
to
which
was
grafted
an
italian
architecture
a
house
of
courts
of
big
paved
yards
fountains
and
cool
dark
rooms
when
i
passed
through
the
gates
i
realized
for
the
first
time
something
of
kara
importance
there
were
a
score
of
servants
all
eastern
perfectly
trained
silent
and
obsequious
he
led
us
to
his
own
room
it
was
a
big
apartment
with
divans
running
round
the
wall
the
most
ornate
french
drawing
room
suite
and
an
enormous
persian
carpet
one
of
the
finest
of
the
kind
that
has
ever
been
turned
out
of
shiraz
here
let
me
say
that
throughout
the
trip
his
attitude
to
me
had
been
perfectly
friendly
and
towards
grace
all
that
i
could
ask
of
my
best
friend
considerate
and
tactful
had
hardly
reached
his
room
before
he
said
to
me
with
that
bonhomie
which
he
had
observed
throughout
the
trip
would
like
to
see
your
room
i
expressed
a
wish
to
that
effect
he
clapped
his
hands
and
a
big
albanian
servant
came
through
the
curtained
doorway
made
the
usual
salaam
and
kara
spoke
to
him
a
few
words
in
a
language
which
i
presume
was
turkish
will
show
you
the
way
said
kara
with
his
most
genial
smile
i
followed
the
servant
through
the
curtains
which
had
hardly
fallen
behind
me
before
i
was
seized
by
four
men
flung
violently
on
the
ground
a
filthy
tarbosch
was
thrust
into
my
mouth
and
before
i
knew
what
was
happening
i
was
bound
hand
and
foot
as
i
realised
the
gross
treachery
of
the
man
my
first
frantic
thoughts
were
of
grace
and
her
safety
i
struggled
with
the
strength
of
three
men
but
they
were
too
many
for
me
and
i
was
dragged
along
the
passage
a
door
was
opened
and
i
was
flung
into
a
bare
room
i
must
have
been
lying
on
the
floor
for
half
an
hour
when
they
came
for
me
this
time
accompanied
by
a
man
named
savolio
who
was
either
an
italian
or
a
greek
he
spoke
english
fairly
well
and
he
made
it
clear
to
me
that
i
had
to
behave
myself
i
was
led
back
to
the
room
from
whence
i
had
come
and
found
kara
sitting
in
one
of
those
big
armchairs
which
he
affected
smoking
a
cigarette
confronting
him
still
in
her
turkish
dress
was
poor
grace
she
was
not
bound
i
was
pleased
to
see
but
when
on
my
entrance
she
rose
and
made
as
if
to
come
towards
me
she
was
unceremoniously
thrown
back
by
the
guardian
who
stood
at
her
side
john
lexman
drawled
kara
are
at
the
beginning
of
a
great
disillusionment
i
have
a
few
things
to
tell
you
which
will
make
you
feel
rather
uncomfortable
it
was
then
that
i
heard
for
the
first
time
that
my
pardon
had
been
signed
and
my
innocence
discovered
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
get
you
in
prison
said
kara
is
likely
that
i
going
to
allow
all
my
plans
to
be
undone
and
my
plan
is
to
make
you
both
extremely
uncomfortable
he
did
not
raise
his
voice
speaking
still
in
the
same
conversational
tone
suave
and
half
amused
hate
you
for
two
things
he
said
and
ticked
them
off
on
his
fingers
first
is
that
you
took
the
woman
that
i
wanted
to
a
man
of
my
temperament
that
is
an
unpardonable
crime
i
have
never
wanted
women
either
as
friends
or
as
amusement
i
am
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
world
who
are
it
happened
that
i
wanted
your
wife
and
she
rejected
me
because
apparently
she
preferred
you
he
looked
at
me
quizzically
are
thinking
at
this
moment
he
went
on
slowly
i
want
her
now
and
that
it
is
part
of
my
revenge
that
i
shall
put
her
straight
in
my
harem
nothing
is
farther
from
my
desires
or
my
thoughts
the
black
roman
is
not
satisfied
with
the
leavings
of
such
poor
trash
as
you
i
hate
you
both
equally
and
for
both
of
you
there
is
waiting
an
experience
more
terrible
than
even
your
elastic
imagination
can
conjure
you
understand
what
that
means
he
asked
me
still
retaining
his
calm
i
did
not
reply
i
dared
not
look
at
grace
to
whom
he
turned
believe
you
love
your
husband
my
friend
he
said
love
will
be
put
to
a
very
severe
test
you
shall
see
him
the
mere
wreckage
of
the
man
he
is
you
shall
see
him
brutalized
below
the
level
of
the
cattle
in
the
field
i
will
give
you
both
no
joys
no
ease
of
mind
from
this
moment
you
are
slaves
and
worse
than
slaves
he
clapped
his
hands
the
interview
was
ended
and
from
that
moment
i
only
saw
grace
john
lexman
stopped
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
they
took
me
to
an
underground
dungeon
cut
in
the
solid
rock
in
many
ways
it
resembled
the
dungeon
of
the
chateau
of
chillon
in
that
its
only
window
looked
out
upon
a
wild
lake
and
its
floor
was
jagged
rock
i
have
called
it
underground
as
indeed
it
was
on
that
side
for
the
palazzo
was
built
upon
a
steep
slope
running
down
from
the
spur
of
the
hills
they
chained
me
by
the
legs
and
left
me
to
my
own
devices
once
a
day
they
gave
me
a
little
goat
flesh
and
a
pannikin
of
water
and
once
a
week
kara
would
come
in
and
outside
the
radius
of
my
chain
he
would
open
a
little
camp
stool
and
sitting
down
smoke
his
cigarette
and
talk
my
god
the
things
that
man
said
the
things
he
described
the
horrors
he
related
and
always
it
was
grace
who
was
the
centre
of
his
description
and
he
would
relate
the
stories
he
was
telling
to
her
about
myself
i
can
not
describe
them
they
are
beyond
john
lexman
shuddered
and
closed
his
eyes
that
was
his
weapon
he
did
not
confront
me
with
the
torture
of
my
darling
he
did
not
bring
tangible
evidence
of
her
suffering
he
just
sat
and
talked
describing
with
a
remarkable
clarity
of
language
which
seemed
incredible
in
a
foreigner
the
which
he
himself
had
witnessed
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
twice
i
sprang
at
him
and
twice
the
chain
about
my
legs
threw
me
headlong
on
that
cruel
floor
once
he
brought
the
jailer
in
to
whip
me
but
i
took
the
whipping
with
such
phlegm
that
it
gave
him
no
satisfaction
i
told
you
i
had
seen
grace
only
once
and
this
is
how
it
happened
it
was
after
the
flogging
and
kara
who
was
a
veritable
demon
in
his
rage
planned
to
have
his
revenge
for
my
indifference
they
brought
grace
out
upon
a
boat
and
rowed
the
boat
to
where
i
could
see
it
from
my
window
there
the
whip
which
had
been
applied
to
me
was
applied
to
her
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
about
that
he
said
brokenly
but
i
wish
you
do
know
how
fervently
that
i
had
broken
down
and
given
the
dog
the
satisfaction
he
wanted
my
god
it
was
horrible
when
the
winter
came
they
used
to
take
me
out
with
chains
on
my
legs
to
gather
in
wood
from
the
forest
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
be
given
this
work
but
the
truth
was
as
i
discovered
from
salvolio
that
kara
thought
my
dungeon
was
too
warm
it
was
sheltered
from
the
winds
by
the
hill
behind
and
even
on
the
coldest
days
and
nights
it
was
not
unbearable
then
kara
went
away
for
some
time
i
think
he
must
have
gone
to
england
and
he
came
back
in
a
white
fury
one
of
his
big
plans
had
gone
wrong
and
the
mental
torture
he
inflicted
upon
me
was
more
acute
than
ever
in
the
old
days
he
used
to
come
once
a
week
now
he
came
almost
every
day
he
usually
arrived
in
the
afternoon
and
i
was
surprised
one
night
to
be
awakened
from
my
sleep
to
see
him
standing
at
the
door
a
lantern
in
his
hand
his
inevitable
cigarette
in
his
mouth
he
always
wore
the
albanian
costume
when
he
was
in
the
country
those
white
kilted
skirts
and
zouave
jackets
which
the
hillsmen
affect
and
if
anything
it
added
to
his
demoniacal
appearance
he
put
down
the
lantern
and
leant
against
the
wall
afraid
that
wife
of
yours
is
breaking
up
lexman
he
drawled
is
the
good
stout
english
stuff
that
i
thought
she
was
i
made
no
reply
i
had
found
by
bitter
experience
that
if
i
intruded
into
the
conversation
i
should
only
suffer
the
more
have
sent
down
to
durazzo
to
get
a
doctor
he
went
on
having
taken
all
this
trouble
i
do
want
to
lose
you
by
death
she
is
breaking
up
he
repeated
with
relish
and
yet
with
an
undertone
of
annoyance
in
his
voice
asked
for
you
three
times
this
morning
i
kept
myself
under
control
as
i
had
never
expected
that
a
man
so
desperately
circumstanced
could
do
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
has
she
done
that
she
should
deserve
this
hell
in
which
she
has
lived
he
sent
out
a
long
ring
of
smoke
and
watched
its
progress
across
the
dungeon
has
she
done
he
said
keeping
his
eye
on
the
ring
i
shall
always
remember
every
look
every
gesture
and
every
intonation
of
his
voice
she
has
done
all
that
a
woman
can
do
for
a
man
like
me
she
has
made
me
feel
little
until
i
had
a
rebuff
from
her
i
had
all
the
world
at
my
feet
lexman
i
did
as
i
liked
if
i
crooked
my
little
finger
people
ran
after
me
and
that
one
experience
with
her
has
broken
me
oh
do
think
he
went
on
quickly
i
am
broken
in
love
i
never
loved
her
very
much
it
was
just
a
passing
passion
but
she
killed
my
after
then
whenever
i
came
to
a
crucial
moment
in
my
affairs
when
the
big
manner
the
big
certainty
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
carry
my
way
whenever
i
was
most
confident
of
myself
and
my
ability
and
my
scheme
a
vision
of
this
damned
girl
rose
and
i
felt
that
momentary
weakening
that
memory
of
defeat
which
made
all
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
hated
her
and
i
hate
her
still
he
said
with
vehemence
she
dies
i
shall
hate
her
more
because
she
will
remain
everlastingly
unbroken
to
menace
my
thoughts
and
spoil
my
schemes
through
all
eternity
he
leant
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
clenched
fist
under
his
chin
how
well
i
can
see
him
and
stared
at
me
could
have
been
king
here
in
this
land
he
said
waving
his
hand
toward
the
interior
could
have
bribed
and
shot
my
way
to
the
throne
of
albania
do
you
realize
what
that
means
to
a
man
like
me
there
is
still
a
chance
and
if
i
could
keep
your
wife
alive
if
i
could
see
her
broken
in
reason
and
in
health
a
poor
skeleton
gibbering
thing
that
knelt
at
my
feet
when
i
came
near
her
i
should
recover
the
mastery
of
myself
believe
me
he
said
nodding
his
head
wife
will
have
the
best
medical
advice
that
it
is
possible
to
obtain
kara
went
out
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
for
a
very
long
time
he
sent
word
just
a
scrawled
note
in
the
morning
to
say
my
wife
had
john
lexman
rose
up
from
his
seat
and
paced
the
apartment
his
head
upon
his
breast
from
that
moment
he
said
i
lived
only
for
one
thing
to
punish
remington
kara
and
gentlemen
i
punished
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
thumped
his
broad
chest
with
his
clenched
hand
i
killed
remington
kara
he
said
and
there
was
a
little
gasp
of
astonishment
from
every
man
present
save
one
that
one
was
meredith
who
had
known
all
the
time
chapter
xxii
after
a
while
lexman
resumed
his
story
i
told
you
that
there
was
a
man
at
the
palazzo
named
salvolio
salvolio
was
a
man
who
had
been
undergoing
a
life
sentence
in
one
of
the
prisons
of
southern
italy
in
some
mysterious
fashion
he
escaped
and
got
across
the
adriatic
in
a
small
boat
how
kara
found
him
i
do
know
salvolio
was
a
very
uncommunicative
person
i
was
never
certain
whether
he
was
a
greek
or
an
italian
all
that
i
am
sure
about
is
that
he
was
the
most
unmitigated
villain
next
to
his
master
that
i
have
ever
met
he
was
a
quick
man
with
his
knife
and
i
have
seen
him
kill
one
of
the
guards
whom
he
had
thought
was
favouring
me
in
the
matter
of
diet
with
less
compunction
than
you
would
kill
a
rat
it
was
he
who
gave
me
this
scar
john
lexman
pointed
to
his
cheek
in
his
master
absence
he
took
upon
himself
the
task
of
conducting
a
clumsy
imitation
of
kara
persecution
he
gave
me
too
the
only
glimpse
i
ever
had
of
the
torture
poor
grace
underwent
she
hated
dogs
and
kara
must
have
come
to
know
this
and
in
her
sleeping
room
she
was
apparently
better
accommodated
than
i
he
kept
four
fierce
beasts
so
chained
that
they
could
almost
reach
her
some
reference
to
my
wife
from
this
low
brute
maddened
me
beyond
endurance
and
i
sprang
at
him
he
whipped
out
his
knife
and
struck
at
me
as
i
fell
and
i
escaped
by
a
miracle
he
evidently
had
orders
not
to
touch
me
for
he
was
in
a
great
panic
of
mind
as
he
had
reason
to
be
because
on
kara
return
he
discovered
the
state
of
my
face
started
an
enquiry
and
had
salvolio
taken
to
the
courtyard
in
the
true
eastern
style
and
bastinadoed
until
his
feet
were
pulp
you
may
be
sure
the
man
hated
me
with
a
malignity
which
almost
rivalled
his
employer
after
grace
death
kara
went
away
suddenly
and
i
was
left
to
the
tender
mercy
of
this
man
evidently
he
had
been
given
a
fairly
free
hand
the
principal
object
of
kara
hate
being
dead
he
took
little
further
interest
in
me
or
else
wearied
of
his
hobby
salvolio
began
his
persecutions
by
reducing
my
diet
fortunately
i
ate
very
little
nevertheless
the
supplies
began
to
grow
less
and
less
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
this
starvation
system
when
there
happened
a
thing
which
changed
the
whole
course
of
my
life
and
opened
to
me
a
way
to
freedom
and
to
vengeance
salvolio
did
not
imitate
the
austerity
of
his
master
and
in
absence
was
in
the
habit
of
having
little
orgies
of
his
own
he
would
bring
up
dancing
girls
from
durazzo
for
his
amusement
and
invite
prominent
men
in
the
neighbourhood
to
his
feasts
and
entertainments
for
he
was
absolutely
lord
of
the
palazzo
when
kara
was
away
and
could
do
pretty
well
as
he
liked
on
this
particular
night
the
festivities
had
been
more
than
usually
prolonged
for
as
near
as
i
could
judge
by
the
which
was
creeping
in
through
my
window
it
was
about
four
in
the
morning
when
the
big
door
was
opened
and
salvolio
came
in
more
than
a
little
drunk
he
brought
with
him
as
i
judged
one
of
his
dancing
girls
who
apparently
was
privileged
to
see
the
sights
of
the
palace
for
a
long
time
he
stood
in
the
doorway
talking
incoherently
in
a
language
which
i
think
must
have
been
turkish
for
i
caught
one
or
two
words
whoever
the
girl
was
she
seemed
a
little
frightened
i
could
see
that
because
she
shrank
back
from
him
though
his
arm
was
about
her
shoulders
and
he
was
half
supporting
his
weight
upon
her
there
was
fear
not
only
in
the
curious
little
glances
she
shot
at
me
from
time
to
time
but
also
in
the
averted
face
her
story
i
was
to
learn
she
was
not
of
the
class
from
whence
salvolio
found
the
dancers
who
from
time
to
time
came
up
to
the
palace
for
his
amusement
and
the
amusement
of
his
guests
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
turkish
merchant
of
scutari
who
had
been
received
into
the
catholic
church
her
father
had
gone
down
to
durazzo
during
the
first
balkan
war
and
then
salvolio
had
seen
the
girl
unknown
to
her
parent
and
there
had
been
some
rough
kind
of
courtship
which
ended
in
her
running
away
on
this
very
day
and
joining
her
lover
at
the
palazzo
i
tell
you
this
because
the
fact
had
some
bearing
on
my
own
fate
as
i
say
the
girl
was
frightened
and
made
as
though
to
go
from
the
dungeon
she
was
probably
scared
both
by
the
unkempt
prisoner
and
by
the
drunken
man
at
her
side
he
however
could
not
leave
without
showing
to
her
something
of
his
authority
he
came
lurching
over
near
where
i
lay
his
long
knife
balanced
in
his
hand
ready
for
emergencies
and
broke
into
a
string
of
vituperations
of
the
character
to
which
i
was
quite
hardened
then
he
took
a
flying
kick
at
me
and
got
home
in
my
ribs
but
again
i
experienced
neither
a
sense
of
indignity
nor
any
great
hurt
salvolio
had
treated
me
like
this
before
and
i
had
survived
it
in
the
midst
of
the
tirade
looking
past
him
i
was
a
new
witness
to
an
extraordinary
scene
the
girl
stood
in
the
open
doorway
shrinking
back
against
the
door
looking
with
distress
and
pity
at
the
spectacle
which
brutality
afforded
then
suddenly
there
appeared
beside
her
a
tall
turk
he
was
and
forbidding
she
looked
round
and
saw
him
and
her
mouth
opened
to
utter
a
cry
but
with
a
gesture
he
silenced
her
and
pointed
to
the
darkness
outside
without
a
word
she
cringed
past
him
her
sandalled
feet
making
no
noise
all
this
time
salvolio
was
continuing
his
stream
of
abuse
but
he
must
have
seen
the
wonder
in
my
eyes
for
he
stopped
and
turned
the
old
turk
took
one
stride
forward
encircled
his
body
with
his
left
arm
and
there
they
stood
grotesquely
like
a
couple
who
were
going
to
start
to
waltz
the
turk
was
a
head
taller
than
salvolio
and
as
i
could
see
a
man
of
immense
strength
they
looked
at
one
another
face
to
face
salvolio
rapidly
recovering
his
senses
and
then
the
turk
gave
him
a
gentle
punch
in
the
ribs
that
is
what
it
seemed
like
to
me
but
salvolio
coughed
horribly
went
limp
in
the
other
arms
and
dropped
with
a
thud
to
the
ground
the
turk
leant
down
soberly
and
wiped
his
long
knife
on
the
other
jacket
before
he
put
it
back
in
the
sash
at
his
waist
then
with
a
glance
at
me
he
turned
to
go
but
stopped
at
the
door
and
looked
back
thoughtfully
he
said
something
in
turkish
which
i
could
not
understand
then
he
spoke
in
french
are
you
he
asked
in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
explained
he
came
over
and
looked
at
the
manacle
about
my
leg
and
shook
his
head
will
never
be
able
to
get
that
undone
he
said
he
caught
hold
of
the
chain
which
was
a
fairly
long
one
bound
it
twice
round
his
arm
and
steadying
his
arm
across
his
thigh
he
turned
with
a
sudden
jerk
there
was
a
smart
as
the
chain
parted
he
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
me
to
my
feet
the
chain
about
your
waist
effendi
he
said
and
he
took
a
revolver
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
me
may
need
this
before
we
get
back
to
durazzo
he
said
his
belt
was
literally
bristling
with
weapons
i
saw
three
revolvers
beside
the
one
i
possessed
and
he
had
evidently
come
prepared
for
trouble
we
made
our
way
from
the
dungeon
into
the
world
without
it
was
the
second
time
i
had
been
in
the
open
air
for
eighteen
months
and
my
knees
were
trembling
under
me
with
weakness
and
excitement
the
old
man
shut
the
prison
door
behind
us
and
walked
on
until
we
came
up
to
the
girl
waiting
for
us
by
the
lakeside
she
was
weeping
softly
and
he
spoke
to
her
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
and
her
weeping
ceased
daughter
of
mine
will
show
us
the
way
he
said
do
not
know
this
part
of
the
country
she
knows
it
too
well
to
cut
a
long
story
short
said
lexman
we
reached
durazzo
in
the
afternoon
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
follow
us
up
and
neither
my
absence
nor
the
body
of
salvolio
were
discovered
until
late
in
the
afternoon
you
must
remember
that
nobody
but
salvolio
was
allowed
into
my
prison
and
therefore
nobody
had
the
courage
to
make
any
investigations
the
old
man
got
me
to
his
house
without
being
observed
and
brought
a
or
some
relative
of
his
to
remove
the
anklet
the
name
of
my
host
was
hussein
effendi
that
same
night
we
left
with
a
little
caravan
to
visit
some
of
the
old
man
relatives
he
was
not
certain
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
his
act
and
for
safety
sake
took
this
trip
which
would
enable
him
if
need
be
to
seek
sanctuary
with
some
of
the
wilder
turkish
tribes
who
would
give
him
protection
in
that
three
months
i
saw
albania
as
it
is
it
was
an
experience
never
to
be
forgotten
if
there
is
a
better
man
in
god
world
than
hiabam
hussein
effendi
i
have
yet
to
meet
him
it
was
he
who
provided
me
with
money
to
leave
albania
i
begged
from
him
too
the
knife
with
which
he
had
killed
salvolio
he
had
discovered
that
kara
was
in
england
and
told
me
something
of
the
greek
occupation
which
i
had
not
known
before
i
crossed
to
italy
and
went
on
to
milan
there
it
was
that
i
learnt
that
an
eccentric
englishman
who
had
arrived
a
few
days
previously
on
one
of
the
south
american
boats
at
genoa
was
in
my
hotel
desperately
my
hotel
i
need
hardly
tell
you
was
not
a
very
expensive
one
and
we
were
evidently
the
only
two
englishmen
in
the
place
i
could
do
no
less
than
go
up
and
see
what
i
could
do
for
the
poor
fellow
who
was
pretty
well
gone
when
i
saw
him
i
seemed
to
remember
having
seen
him
before
and
when
looking
round
for
some
identification
i
discovered
his
name
i
readily
recalled
the
circumstance
it
was
george
gathercole
who
had
returned
from
south
america
he
was
suffering
from
malarial
fever
and
blood
poisoning
and
for
a
week
with
an
italian
doctor
i
fought
as
hard
as
any
man
could
fight
for
his
life
he
was
a
trying
patient
john
lexman
smiled
suddenly
at
the
recollection
vitriolic
in
his
language
impatient
and
imperious
in
his
attitude
to
his
friends
he
was
for
example
terribly
sensitive
about
his
lost
arm
and
would
not
allow
either
the
doctor
or
to
enter
the
room
until
he
was
covered
to
the
neck
nor
would
he
eat
or
drink
in
our
presence
yet
he
was
the
bravest
of
the
brave
careless
of
himself
and
only
fretful
because
he
had
not
time
to
finish
his
new
book
his
indomitable
spirit
did
not
save
him
he
died
on
the
of
january
of
this
year
i
was
in
genoa
at
the
time
having
gone
there
at
his
request
to
save
his
belongings
when
i
returned
he
had
been
buried
i
went
through
his
papers
and
it
was
then
that
i
conceived
my
idea
of
how
i
might
approach
kara
i
found
a
letter
from
the
greek
which
had
been
addressed
to
buenos
ayres
to
await
arrival
and
then
i
remembered
in
a
flash
how
kara
had
told
me
he
had
sent
george
gathercole
to
south
america
to
report
upon
possible
gold
formations
i
was
determined
to
kill
kara
and
determined
to
kill
him
in
such
a
way
that
i
myself
would
cover
every
trace
of
my
complicity
even
as
he
had
planned
my
downfall
scheming
every
step
and
covering
his
trail
so
did
i
plan
to
bring
about
his
death
that
no
suspicion
should
fall
on
me
i
knew
his
house
i
knew
something
of
his
habits
i
knew
the
fear
in
which
he
went
when
he
was
in
england
and
away
from
the
feudal
guards
who
had
surrounded
him
in
albania
i
knew
of
his
famous
door
with
its
steel
latch
and
i
was
planning
to
circumvent
all
these
precautions
and
bring
to
him
not
only
the
death
he
deserved
but
a
full
knowledge
of
his
fate
before
he
died
gathercole
had
some
money
about
pounds
i
took
pounds
of
this
for
my
own
use
knowing
that
i
should
have
sufficient
in
london
to
recompense
his
heirs
and
the
remainder
of
the
money
with
all
such
documents
as
he
had
save
those
which
identified
him
with
kara
i
handed
over
to
the
british
consul
i
was
not
unlike
the
dead
man
my
beard
had
grown
wild
and
i
knew
enough
of
gathercole
eccentricities
to
live
the
part
the
first
step
i
took
was
to
announce
my
arrival
by
inference
i
am
a
fairly
good
journalist
with
a
wide
general
knowledge
and
with
this
corrected
by
reference
to
the
necessary
books
which
i
found
in
the
british
museum
library
i
was
able
to
turn
out
a
very
respectable
article
on
patagonia
this
i
sent
to
the
times
with
one
of
gathercole
cards
and
as
you
know
it
was
printed
my
next
step
was
to
find
suitable
lodgings
between
chelsea
and
scotland
yard
i
was
fortunate
in
being
able
to
hire
a
furnished
flat
the
owner
of
which
was
going
to
the
south
of
france
for
three
months
i
paid
the
rent
in
advance
and
since
i
dropped
all
the
eccentricities
i
had
assumed
to
support
the
character
of
gathercole
i
must
have
impressed
the
owner
who
took
me
without
references
i
had
several
suits
of
new
clothes
made
not
in
london
he
smiled
but
in
manchester
and
again
i
made
myself
as
trim
as
possible
to
avoid
when
i
had
got
these
together
in
my
flat
i
chose
my
day
in
the
morning
i
sent
two
trunks
with
most
of
my
personal
belongings
to
the
great
midland
hotel
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
cadogan
square
and
hung
about
until
i
saw
kara
drive
off
it
was
my
first
view
of
him
since
i
had
left
albania
and
it
required
all
my
to
prevent
me
springing
at
him
in
the
street
and
tearing
at
him
with
my
hands
once
he
was
out
of
sight
i
went
to
the
house
adopting
all
the
style
and
all
the
mannerisms
of
poor
gathercole
my
beginning
was
unfortunate
for
with
a
shock
i
recognised
in
the
valet
a
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
warder
cottage
on
the
morning
of
my
escape
from
dartmoor
there
was
no
mistaking
him
and
when
i
heard
his
voice
i
was
certain
would
he
recognise
me
i
wondered
in
spite
of
my
beard
and
my
apparently
he
did
not
i
gave
him
every
chance
i
thrust
my
face
into
his
and
on
my
second
visit
challenged
him
in
the
eccentric
way
which
poor
old
gathercole
had
to
test
the
grey
of
my
beard
for
the
moment
however
i
was
satisfied
with
my
brief
experiment
and
after
a
reasonable
interval
i
went
away
returning
to
my
place
off
victoria
street
and
waiting
till
the
evening
in
my
observation
of
the
house
whilst
i
was
waiting
for
kara
to
depart
i
had
noticed
that
there
were
two
distinct
telephone
wires
running
down
to
the
roof
i
guessed
rather
than
knew
that
one
of
these
telephones
was
a
private
wire
and
knowing
something
of
kara
fear
i
presumed
that
that
wire
would
lead
to
a
police
office
or
at
any
rate
to
a
guardian
of
some
kind
or
other
kara
had
the
same
arrangement
in
albania
connecting
the
palazzo
with
the
gendarme
posts
at
alesso
this
much
hussein
told
me
that
night
i
made
a
reconnaissance
of
the
house
and
saw
kara
window
was
lit
and
at
ten
minutes
past
ten
i
rang
the
bell
and
i
think
it
was
then
that
i
applied
the
test
of
the
beard
kara
was
in
his
room
the
valet
told
me
and
led
the
way
upstairs
i
had
come
prepared
to
deal
with
this
valet
for
i
had
an
especial
reason
for
wishing
that
he
should
not
be
interrogated
by
the
police
on
a
plain
card
i
had
written
the
number
he
bore
in
dartmoor
and
had
added
the
words
know
you
get
out
of
here
quick
as
he
turned
to
lead
the
way
upstairs
i
flung
the
envelope
containing
the
card
on
the
table
in
the
hall
in
an
inside
pocket
as
near
to
my
body
as
i
could
put
them
i
had
the
two
candles
how
i
should
use
them
both
i
had
already
decided
the
valet
ushered
me
into
kara
room
and
once
more
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
killed
my
girl
and
blotted
out
all
that
was
beautiful
in
life
for
there
was
a
breathless
silence
when
he
paused
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
head
upon
his
breast
his
arms
folded
his
eyes
watching
the
other
intently
the
chief
commissioner
with
a
heavy
frown
and
pursed
lips
sat
stroking
his
moustache
and
looking
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
at
the
speaker
the
french
police
officer
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
his
head
on
one
side
was
taking
in
every
word
eagerly
the
russian
impassive
of
face
might
have
been
a
carved
ivory
mask
the
american
the
stump
of
a
dead
cigar
between
his
teeth
shifted
impatiently
with
every
pause
as
though
he
would
hurry
forward
the
denouement
presently
john
lexman
went
on
he
slipped
from
the
bed
and
came
across
to
meet
me
as
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
gathercole
he
said
in
that
silky
tone
of
his
and
held
out
his
hand
i
did
not
speak
i
just
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
fierce
joy
in
my
heart
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
before
experienced
then
he
saw
in
my
eyes
the
truth
and
half
reached
for
the
telephone
but
at
that
moment
i
was
on
him
he
was
a
child
in
my
hands
all
the
bitter
anguish
he
had
brought
upon
me
all
the
hardships
of
starved
days
and
freezing
nights
had
strengthened
and
hardened
me
i
had
come
back
to
london
disguised
with
a
false
arm
and
this
i
shook
free
it
was
merely
a
gauntlet
of
thin
wood
which
i
had
had
made
for
me
in
paris
i
flung
him
back
on
the
bed
and
half
knelt
half
laid
on
him
i
said
are
going
to
die
a
more
merciful
death
than
my
wife
died
he
tried
to
speak
his
soft
hands
gesticulated
wildly
but
i
was
half
lying
on
one
arm
and
held
the
other
i
whispered
in
his
ear
will
know
who
killed
you
kara
think
of
that
i
shall
go
scot
free
and
you
will
be
the
centre
of
a
fine
mystery
all
your
letters
will
be
read
all
your
life
will
be
examined
and
the
world
will
know
you
for
what
you
are
i
released
his
arm
for
just
as
long
as
it
took
to
draw
my
knife
and
strike
i
think
he
died
instantly
john
lexman
said
simply
i
left
him
where
he
was
and
went
to
the
door
i
had
not
much
time
to
spare
i
took
the
candles
from
my
pocket
they
were
already
ductile
from
the
heat
of
my
body
i
lifted
up
the
steel
latch
of
the
door
and
propped
up
the
latch
with
the
smaller
of
the
two
candles
one
end
of
which
was
on
the
middle
socket
and
the
other
beneath
the
latch
the
heat
of
the
room
i
knew
would
still
further
soften
the
candle
and
let
the
latch
down
in
a
short
time
i
was
prepared
for
the
telephone
by
his
bedside
though
i
did
not
know
to
whither
it
led
the
presence
of
the
decided
me
i
balanced
it
across
the
silver
cigarette
box
so
that
one
end
came
under
the
telephone
receiver
under
the
other
end
i
put
the
second
candle
which
i
had
to
cut
to
fit
on
top
of
the
at
the
candle
end
i
balanced
the
only
two
books
i
could
find
in
the
room
and
fortunately
they
were
heavy
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
long
it
would
take
to
melt
the
candle
to
a
state
of
flexion
which
would
allow
the
full
weight
of
the
books
to
bear
upon
the
candle
end
of
the
and
fling
off
the
receiver
i
was
hoping
that
fisher
had
taken
my
warning
and
had
gone
when
i
opened
the
door
softly
i
heard
his
footsteps
in
the
hall
below
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
finish
the
play
i
turned
and
addressed
an
imaginary
conversation
to
kara
it
was
horrible
but
there
was
something
about
it
which
aroused
in
me
a
curious
sense
of
humour
and
i
wanted
to
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
i
heard
the
man
coming
up
the
stairs
and
closed
the
door
gingerly
what
length
of
time
would
it
take
for
the
candle
to
bend
to
completely
establish
the
alibi
i
determined
to
hold
fisher
in
conversation
and
this
was
all
the
easier
since
apparently
he
had
not
seen
the
envelope
i
had
left
on
the
table
downstairs
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
suddenly
with
a
crash
i
heard
the
steel
latch
fall
in
its
place
under
the
effect
of
the
heat
the
candle
had
bent
sooner
than
i
had
expected
i
asked
fisher
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
sound
and
he
explained
i
passed
down
the
stairs
talking
all
the
time
i
found
a
cab
at
sloane
square
and
drove
to
my
lodgings
underneath
my
overcoat
i
was
partly
dressed
in
evening
kit
ten
minutes
after
i
entered
the
door
of
my
flat
i
came
out
a
beardless
man
about
town
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
thousand
others
who
would
be
found
that
night
walking
the
promenade
of
any
of
the
great
from
victoria
street
i
drove
straight
to
scotland
yard
it
was
no
more
than
a
coincidence
that
whilst
i
should
have
been
speaking
with
you
all
the
second
candle
should
have
bent
and
the
alarm
be
given
in
the
very
office
in
which
i
was
sitting
i
assure
you
all
in
all
earnestness
that
i
did
not
suspect
the
cause
of
that
ringing
until
mansus
spoke
there
gentlemen
is
my
story
he
threw
out
his
arms
you
may
do
with
me
as
you
will
kara
was
a
murderer
dyed
a
hundred
times
in
innocent
blood
i
have
done
all
that
i
set
myself
to
do
that
and
no
more
that
and
no
less
i
had
thought
to
go
away
to
america
but
the
nearer
the
day
of
my
departure
approached
the
more
vivid
became
the
memory
of
the
plans
which
she
and
i
had
formed
my
girl
my
poor
martyred
girl
he
sat
at
the
little
table
his
hands
clasped
before
him
his
face
lined
and
white
and
that
is
the
end
he
said
suddenly
with
a
wry
smile
not
quite
swung
round
with
a
gasp
it
was
belinda
mary
who
spoke
i
can
carry
it
on
she
said
she
was
wonderfully
thought
but
then
never
thought
anything
of
her
but
that
she
was
wonderfully
something
or
the
other
most
of
your
story
is
true
lexman
said
this
astonishing
girl
oblivious
of
the
amazed
eyes
that
were
staring
at
her
but
kara
deceived
you
in
one
what
do
you
mean
asked
john
lexman
rising
unsteadily
to
his
feet
for
answer
she
rose
and
walked
back
to
the
door
with
the
chintz
curtains
and
flung
it
open
there
was
a
wait
which
seemed
an
eternity
and
then
through
the
doorway
came
a
girl
slim
and
grave
and
beautiful
my
god
whispered
x
grace
lexman
chapter
xxiii
they
went
out
and
left
them
alone
two
people
who
found
in
this
moment
a
heaven
which
is
not
beyond
the
reach
of
humanity
but
which
is
seldom
attained
to
belinda
mary
had
an
eager
audience
all
to
her
very
self
of
course
she
did
die
she
said
scornfully
kara
was
playing
on
his
fears
all
the
time
he
never
even
harmed
her
in
the
way
lexman
feared
he
told
lexman
that
her
husband
was
dead
just
as
he
told
john
lexman
his
wife
was
gone
what
happened
was
that
he
brought
her
back
to
england
who
asked
incredulously
grace
lexman
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
you
would
think
it
possible
but
when
you
realize
that
he
had
a
yacht
of
his
own
and
that
he
could
travel
up
from
whatever
landing
place
he
chose
to
his
house
in
cadogan
square
by
motorcar
and
that
he
could
take
her
straight
away
into
his
cellar
without
disturbing
his
household
you
understand
that
the
only
difficulty
he
had
was
in
landing
her
it
was
in
the
lower
cellar
that
i
found
you
found
her
in
the
cellar
demanded
the
chief
commissioner
the
girl
nodded
i
found
her
and
the
dog
you
heard
how
kara
terrified
her
and
i
killed
the
dog
with
my
own
hands
she
said
a
little
proudly
and
then
shivered
it
was
very
beastly
she
admitted
and
she
been
living
with
you
all
this
time
and
you
said
nothing
asked
incredulously
belinda
mary
nodded
and
that
is
why
you
did
want
me
to
know
where
you
were
living
she
nodded
again
you
see
she
was
very
ill
she
said
and
i
had
to
nurse
her
up
and
of
course
i
knew
that
it
was
lexman
who
had
killed
kara
and
i
could
tell
you
about
grace
lexman
without
betraying
him
so
when
lexman
decided
to
tell
his
story
i
thought
i
better
supply
the
grand
the
men
looked
at
one
another
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
lexman
asked
the
chief
commissioner
and
by
the
way
how
does
all
this
fit
your
theories
fairly
well
replied
coolly
obviously
the
man
who
committed
the
murder
was
the
man
introduced
into
the
room
as
gathercole
and
as
obviously
it
was
not
gathercole
although
to
all
appearance
he
had
lost
his
left
why
obvious
asked
the
chief
commissioner
because
answered
meredith
the
real
gathercole
had
lost
his
right
arm
that
was
the
one
error
lexman
h
the
chief
pulled
at
his
moustache
and
looked
enquiringly
round
the
room
we
have
to
make
up
our
minds
very
quickly
about
lexman
he
said
what
do
you
think
carlneau
the
frenchman
shrugged
his
shoulders
for
my
part
i
should
not
only
importune
your
home
secretary
to
pardon
him
but
i
should
recommend
him
for
a
pension
he
said
flippantly
what
do
you
think
savorsky
the
russian
smiled
a
little
it
is
a
very
impressive
story
he
said
dispassionately
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
you
intend
bringing
your
lexman
to
judgment
you
are
likely
to
expose
some
very
pretty
scandals
incidentally
he
said
stroking
his
trim
little
moustache
i
might
remark
that
any
exposure
which
drew
attention
to
the
lawless
conditions
of
albania
would
not
be
regarded
by
my
government
with
the
chief
commissioner
eyes
twinkled
and
he
nodded
that
is
also
my
view
said
the
chief
of
the
italian
bureau
naturally
we
are
greatly
interested
in
all
that
happens
on
the
adriatic
littoral
it
seems
to
me
that
kara
has
come
to
a
very
merciful
end
and
i
am
not
inclined
to
regard
a
prosecution
of
lexman
with
well
i
guess
the
political
aspect
of
the
case
does
affect
us
very
much
said
but
as
one
who
was
once
mighty
near
asphyxiated
by
stirring
up
the
wrong
kind
of
mud
i
should
leave
the
matter
where
it
the
chief
commissioner
was
deep
in
thought
and
belinda
mary
eyed
him
anxiously
tell
them
to
come
in
he
said
bluntly
the
girl
went
and
brought
john
lexman
and
his
wife
and
they
came
in
hand
in
hand
supremely
and
serenely
happy
whatever
the
future
might
hold
for
them
the
chief
commissioner
cleared
his
throat
lexman
we
all
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
for
a
very
interesting
story
and
a
most
interesting
theory
what
you
have
done
as
i
understand
the
matter
he
proceeded
deliberately
is
to
put
yourself
in
the
murderer
place
and
advance
a
theory
not
only
as
to
how
the
murder
was
actually
committed
but
as
to
the
motive
for
that
murder
it
is
i
might
say
a
remarkable
piece
of
reconstruction
he
spoke
very
deliberately
and
swept
away
john
lexman
astonished
interruption
with
a
stern
hand
please
wait
and
do
not
speak
until
i
am
out
of
hearing
he
growled
you
have
got
into
the
skin
of
the
actual
assassin
and
have
spoken
most
convincingly
one
might
almost
think
that
the
man
who
killed
remington
kara
was
actually
standing
before
us
for
that
piece
of
impersonation
we
are
all
very
grateful
he
glared
round
over
his
spectacles
at
his
understanding
colleagues
and
they
murmured
approvingly
he
looked
at
his
watch
now
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
off
he
crossed
the
room
and
put
out
his
hand
to
john
lexman
i
wish
you
good
luck
he
said
and
took
both
grace
lexman
hands
in
his
one
of
these
days
he
said
paternally
i
shall
come
down
to
beston
tracey
and
your
husband
shall
tell
me
another
and
a
happier
he
paused
at
the
door
as
he
was
going
out
and
looking
back
caught
the
grateful
eyes
of
lexman
by
the
way
lexman
he
said
hesitatingly
i
do
think
i
should
ever
write
a
story
called
clue
of
the
twisted
candle
if
i
were
john
lexman
shook
his
head
it
will
never
be
written
he
said
by
me
