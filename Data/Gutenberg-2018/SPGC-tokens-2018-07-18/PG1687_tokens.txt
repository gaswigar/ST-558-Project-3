parmenides
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
and
analysis
the
awe
with
which
plato
regarded
the
character
of
parmenides
has
extended
to
the
dialogue
which
he
calls
by
his
name
none
of
the
writings
of
plato
have
been
more
copiously
illustrated
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
and
in
none
of
them
have
the
interpreters
been
more
at
variance
with
one
another
nor
is
this
surprising
for
the
parmenides
is
more
fragmentary
and
isolated
than
any
other
dialogue
and
the
design
of
the
writer
is
not
expressly
stated
the
date
is
uncertain
the
relation
to
the
other
writings
of
plato
is
also
uncertain
the
connexion
between
the
two
parts
is
at
first
sight
extremely
obscure
and
in
the
latter
of
the
two
we
are
left
in
doubt
as
to
whether
plato
is
speaking
his
own
sentiments
by
the
lips
of
parmenides
and
overthrowing
him
out
of
his
own
mouth
or
whether
he
is
propounding
consequences
which
would
have
been
admitted
by
zeno
and
parmenides
themselves
the
contradictions
which
follow
from
the
hypotheses
of
the
one
and
many
have
been
regarded
by
some
as
transcendental
mysteries
by
others
as
a
mere
illustration
taken
at
random
of
a
new
method
they
seem
to
have
been
inspired
by
a
sort
of
dialectical
frenzy
such
as
may
be
supposed
to
have
prevailed
in
the
megarian
school
compare
cratylus
the
criticism
on
his
own
doctrine
of
ideas
has
also
been
considered
not
as
a
real
criticism
but
as
an
exuberance
of
the
metaphysical
imagination
which
enabled
plato
to
go
beyond
himself
to
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
we
may
certainly
apply
the
words
in
which
he
himself
describes
the
earlier
philosophers
in
the
sophist
went
on
their
way
rather
regardless
of
whether
we
understood
them
or
not
the
parmenides
in
point
of
style
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
platonic
writings
the
first
portion
of
the
dialogue
is
in
no
way
defective
in
ease
and
grace
and
dramatic
interest
nor
in
the
second
part
where
there
was
no
room
for
such
qualities
is
there
any
want
of
clearness
or
precision
the
latter
half
is
an
exquisite
mosaic
of
which
the
small
pieces
are
with
the
utmost
fineness
and
regularity
adapted
to
one
another
like
the
protagoras
phaedo
and
others
the
whole
is
a
narrated
dialogue
combining
with
the
mere
recital
of
the
words
spoken
the
observations
of
the
reciter
on
the
effect
produced
by
them
thus
we
are
informed
by
him
that
zeno
and
parmenides
were
not
altogether
pleased
at
the
request
of
socrates
that
they
would
examine
into
the
nature
of
the
one
and
many
in
the
sphere
of
ideas
although
they
received
his
suggestion
with
approving
smiles
and
we
are
glad
to
be
told
that
parmenides
was
but
and
that
zeno
was
also
that
parmenides
affected
to
decline
the
great
argument
on
which
as
zeno
knew
from
experience
he
was
not
unwilling
to
enter
the
character
of
antiphon
the
of
plato
who
had
once
been
inclined
to
philosophy
but
has
now
shown
the
hereditary
disposition
for
horses
is
very
naturally
described
he
is
the
sole
depositary
of
the
famous
dialogue
but
although
he
receives
the
strangers
like
a
courteous
gentleman
he
is
impatient
of
the
trouble
of
reciting
it
as
they
enter
he
has
been
giving
orders
to
a
by
this
slight
touch
plato
verifies
the
previous
description
of
him
after
a
little
persuasion
he
is
induced
to
favour
the
clazomenians
who
come
from
a
distance
with
a
rehearsal
respecting
the
visit
of
zeno
and
parmenides
to
athens
we
may
observe
first
that
such
a
visit
is
consistent
with
dates
and
may
possibly
have
occurred
secondly
that
plato
is
very
likely
to
have
invented
the
meeting
socrates
can
easily
invent
egyptian
tales
or
anything
else
phaedrus
thirdly
that
no
reliance
can
be
placed
on
the
circumstance
as
determining
the
date
of
parmenides
and
zeno
fourthly
that
the
same
occasion
appears
to
be
referred
to
by
plato
in
two
other
places
many
interpreters
have
regarded
the
parmenides
as
a
ad
absurdum
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
but
would
plato
have
been
likely
to
place
this
in
the
mouth
of
the
great
parmenides
himself
who
appeared
to
him
in
homeric
language
to
be
and
awful
and
to
have
a
depth
of
mind
it
may
be
admitted
that
he
has
ascribed
to
an
eleatic
stranger
in
the
sophist
opinions
which
went
beyond
the
doctrines
of
the
eleatics
but
the
eleatic
stranger
expressly
criticises
the
doctrines
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
admits
that
he
is
going
to
hands
on
his
father
parmenides
nothing
of
this
kind
is
said
of
zeno
and
parmenides
how
then
without
a
word
of
explanation
could
plato
assign
to
them
the
refutation
of
their
own
tenets
the
conclusion
at
which
we
must
arrive
is
that
the
parmenides
is
not
a
refutation
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
nor
would
such
an
explanation
afford
any
satisfactory
connexion
of
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
dialogue
and
it
is
quite
inconsistent
with
plato
own
relation
to
the
eleatics
for
of
all
the
philosophers
he
speaks
of
them
with
the
greatest
respect
but
he
could
hardly
have
passed
upon
them
a
more
unmeaning
slight
than
to
ascribe
to
their
great
master
tenets
the
reverse
of
those
which
he
actually
held
two
preliminary
remarks
may
be
made
first
that
whatever
latitude
we
may
allow
to
plato
in
bringing
together
by
a
de
force
as
in
the
phaedrus
dissimilar
themes
yet
he
always
in
some
way
seeks
to
find
a
connexion
for
them
many
threads
join
together
in
one
the
love
and
dialectic
of
the
phaedrus
we
can
not
conceive
that
the
great
artist
would
place
in
juxtaposition
two
absolutely
divided
and
incoherent
subjects
and
hence
we
are
led
to
make
a
second
remark
viz
that
no
explanation
of
the
parmenides
can
be
satisfactory
which
does
not
indicate
the
connexion
of
the
first
and
second
parts
to
suppose
that
plato
would
first
go
out
of
his
way
to
make
parmenides
attack
the
platonic
ideas
and
then
proceed
to
a
similar
but
more
fatal
assault
on
his
own
doctrine
of
being
appears
to
be
the
height
of
absurdity
perhaps
there
is
no
passage
in
plato
showing
greater
metaphysical
power
than
that
in
which
he
assails
his
own
theory
of
ideas
the
arguments
are
nearly
if
not
quite
those
of
aristotle
they
are
the
objections
which
naturally
occur
to
a
modern
student
of
philosophy
many
persons
will
be
surprised
to
find
plato
criticizing
the
very
conceptions
which
have
been
supposed
in
after
ages
to
be
peculiarly
characteristic
of
him
how
can
he
have
placed
himself
so
completely
without
them
how
can
he
have
ever
persisted
in
them
after
seeing
the
fatal
objections
which
might
be
urged
against
them
the
consideration
of
this
difficulty
has
led
a
recent
critic
ueberweg
who
in
general
accepts
the
authorised
canon
of
the
platonic
writings
to
condemn
the
parmenides
as
spurious
the
accidental
want
of
external
evidence
at
first
sight
seems
to
favour
this
opinion
in
answer
it
might
be
sufficient
to
say
that
no
ancient
writing
of
equal
length
and
excellence
is
known
to
be
spurious
nor
is
the
silence
of
aristotle
to
be
hastily
assumed
there
is
at
least
a
doubt
whether
his
use
of
the
same
arguments
does
not
involve
the
inference
that
he
knew
the
work
and
if
the
parmenides
is
spurious
like
ueberweg
we
are
led
on
further
than
we
originally
intended
to
pass
a
similar
condemnation
on
the
theaetetus
and
sophist
and
therefore
on
the
politicus
compare
but
the
objection
is
in
reality
fanciful
and
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
doctrine
of
the
ideas
was
held
by
plato
throughout
his
life
in
the
same
form
for
the
truth
is
that
the
platonic
ideas
were
in
constant
process
of
growth
and
transmutation
sometimes
veiled
in
poetry
and
mythology
then
again
emerging
as
fixed
ideas
in
some
passages
regarded
as
absolute
and
eternal
and
in
others
as
relative
to
the
human
mind
existing
in
and
derived
from
external
objects
as
well
as
transcending
them
the
anamnesis
of
the
ideas
is
chiefly
insisted
upon
in
the
mythical
portions
of
the
dialogues
and
really
occupies
a
very
small
space
in
the
entire
works
of
plato
their
transcendental
existence
is
not
asserted
and
is
therefore
implicitly
denied
in
the
philebus
different
forms
are
ascribed
to
them
in
the
republic
and
they
are
mentioned
in
the
theaetetus
the
sophist
the
politicus
and
the
laws
much
as
universals
would
be
spoken
of
in
modern
books
indeed
there
are
very
faint
traces
of
the
transcendental
doctrine
of
ideas
that
is
of
their
existence
apart
from
the
mind
in
any
of
plato
writings
with
the
exception
of
the
meno
the
phaedrus
the
phaedo
and
in
portions
of
the
republic
the
stereotyped
form
which
aristotle
has
given
to
them
is
not
found
in
plato
compare
essay
on
the
platonic
ideas
in
the
introduction
to
the
meno
the
full
discussion
of
this
subject
involves
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
philosophy
of
plato
which
would
be
out
of
place
here
but
without
digressing
further
from
the
immediate
subject
of
the
parmenides
we
may
remark
that
plato
is
quite
serious
in
his
objections
to
his
own
doctrines
nor
does
socrates
attempt
to
offer
any
answer
to
them
the
perplexities
which
surround
the
one
and
many
in
the
sphere
of
the
ideas
are
also
alluded
to
in
the
philebus
and
no
answer
is
given
to
them
nor
have
they
ever
been
answered
nor
can
they
be
answered
by
any
one
else
who
separates
the
phenomenal
from
the
real
to
suppose
that
plato
at
a
later
period
of
his
life
reached
a
point
of
view
from
which
he
was
able
to
answer
them
is
a
groundless
assumption
the
real
progress
of
own
mind
has
been
partly
concealed
from
us
by
the
dogmatic
statements
of
aristotle
and
also
by
the
degeneracy
of
his
own
followers
with
whom
a
doctrine
of
numbers
quickly
superseded
ideas
as
a
preparation
for
answering
some
of
the
difficulties
which
have
been
suggested
we
may
begin
by
sketching
the
first
portion
of
the
dialogue
cephalus
of
clazomenae
in
ionia
the
birthplace
of
anaxagoras
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city
in
the
history
of
philosophy
who
is
the
narrator
of
the
dialogue
describes
himself
as
meeting
adeimantus
and
glaucon
in
the
agora
at
athens
cephalus
can
we
do
anything
for
you
in
athens
yes
i
came
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
first
tell
me
your
name
which
i
have
forgotten
he
was
a
mere
child
when
i
was
last
here
i
know
his
father
which
is
pyrilampes
and
the
name
of
our
brother
is
antiphon
but
why
do
you
ask
me
introduce
to
you
some
countrymen
of
mine
who
are
lovers
of
philosophy
they
have
heard
that
antiphon
remembers
a
conversation
of
socrates
with
parmenides
and
zeno
of
which
the
report
came
to
him
from
pythodorus
zeno
friend
is
quite
true
can
they
hear
the
dialogue
easier
in
the
days
of
his
youth
he
made
a
careful
study
of
the
piece
at
present
his
thoughts
have
another
direction
he
takes
after
his
grandfather
and
has
given
up
philosophy
for
horses
went
to
look
for
him
and
found
him
giving
instructions
to
a
worker
in
brass
about
a
bridle
when
he
had
done
with
him
and
had
learned
from
his
brothers
the
purpose
of
our
visit
he
saluted
me
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
we
asked
him
to
repeat
the
dialogue
at
first
he
complained
of
the
trouble
but
he
soon
consented
he
told
us
that
pythodorus
had
described
to
him
the
appearance
of
parmenides
and
zeno
they
had
come
to
athens
at
the
great
panathenaea
the
former
being
at
the
time
about
years
old
aged
but
zeno
who
was
said
to
have
been
beloved
of
parmenides
in
the
days
of
his
youth
about
forty
and
very
that
they
lodged
with
pythodorus
at
the
ceramicus
outside
the
wall
whither
socrates
then
a
very
young
man
came
to
see
them
zeno
was
reading
one
of
his
theses
which
he
had
nearly
finished
when
pythodorus
entered
with
parmenides
and
aristoteles
who
was
afterwards
one
of
the
thirty
when
the
recitation
was
completed
socrates
requested
that
the
first
thesis
of
the
treatise
might
be
read
again
mean
zeno
said
socrates
argue
that
being
if
it
is
many
must
be
both
like
and
unlike
which
is
a
contradiction
and
each
division
of
your
argument
is
intended
to
elicit
a
similar
absurdity
which
may
be
supposed
to
follow
from
the
assumption
that
being
is
many
is
my
meaning
see
said
socrates
turning
to
parmenides
zeno
is
your
second
self
in
his
writings
too
you
prove
admirably
that
the
all
is
one
he
gives
proofs
no
less
convincing
that
the
many
are
nought
to
deceive
the
world
by
saying
the
same
thing
in
entirely
different
forms
is
a
strain
of
art
beyond
most
of
us
socrates
said
zeno
though
you
are
as
keen
as
a
spartan
hound
you
do
not
quite
catch
the
motive
of
the
piece
which
was
only
intended
to
protect
parmenides
against
ridicule
by
showing
that
the
hypothesis
of
the
existence
of
the
many
involved
greater
absurdities
than
the
hypothesis
of
the
one
the
book
was
a
youthful
composition
of
mine
which
was
stolen
from
me
and
therefore
i
had
no
choice
about
the
publication
quite
believe
you
said
socrates
will
you
answer
me
a
question
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
would
assume
an
idea
of
likeness
in
the
abstract
which
is
the
contradictory
of
unlikeness
in
the
abstract
by
participation
in
either
or
both
of
which
things
are
like
or
unlike
or
partly
both
for
the
same
things
may
very
well
partake
of
like
and
unlike
in
the
concrete
though
like
and
unlike
in
the
abstract
are
irreconcilable
nor
does
there
appear
to
me
to
be
any
absurdity
in
maintaining
that
the
same
things
may
partake
of
the
one
and
many
though
i
should
be
indeed
surprised
to
hear
that
the
absolute
one
is
also
many
for
example
i
being
many
that
is
to
say
having
many
parts
or
members
am
yet
also
one
and
partake
of
the
one
being
one
of
seven
who
are
here
present
compare
philebus
this
is
not
an
absurdity
but
a
truism
but
i
should
be
amazed
if
there
were
a
similar
entanglement
in
the
nature
of
the
ideas
themselves
nor
can
i
believe
that
one
and
many
like
and
unlike
rest
and
motion
in
the
abstract
are
capable
either
of
admixture
or
of
separation
pythodorus
said
that
in
his
opinion
parmenides
and
zeno
were
not
very
well
pleased
at
the
questions
which
were
raised
nevertheless
they
looked
at
one
another
and
smiled
in
seeming
delight
and
admiration
of
socrates
me
said
parmenides
you
think
that
the
abstract
ideas
of
likeness
unity
and
the
rest
exist
apart
from
individuals
which
partake
of
them
and
is
this
your
own
distinction
think
that
there
are
such
ideas
would
you
make
abstract
ideas
of
the
just
the
beautiful
the
good
he
said
of
human
beings
like
ourselves
of
water
fire
and
the
like
am
not
certain
would
you
be
undecided
also
about
ideas
of
which
the
mention
will
perhaps
appear
laughable
of
hair
mud
filth
and
other
things
which
are
base
and
vile
parmenides
visible
things
like
these
are
as
i
believe
only
what
they
appear
to
be
though
i
am
sometimes
disposed
to
imagine
that
there
is
nothing
without
an
idea
but
i
repress
any
such
notion
from
a
fear
of
falling
into
an
abyss
of
nonsense
are
young
socrates
and
therefore
naturally
regard
the
opinions
of
men
the
time
will
come
when
philosophy
will
have
a
firmer
hold
of
you
and
you
will
not
despise
even
the
meanest
things
but
tell
me
is
your
meaning
that
things
become
like
by
partaking
of
likeness
great
by
partaking
of
greatness
just
and
beautiful
by
partaking
of
justice
and
beauty
and
so
of
other
ideas
that
is
my
meaning
do
you
suppose
the
individual
to
partake
of
the
whole
or
of
the
part
not
of
the
whole
said
socrates
said
parmenides
that
case
the
whole
which
is
one
will
become
many
said
socrates
whole
may
be
like
the
day
which
is
one
and
in
many
places
in
this
way
the
ideas
may
be
one
and
also
many
the
same
sort
of
way
said
parmenides
a
sail
which
is
one
may
be
a
cover
to
many
that
is
your
meaning
would
you
say
that
each
man
is
covered
by
the
whole
sail
or
by
a
part
only
a
part
the
ideas
have
parts
and
the
objects
partake
of
a
part
of
them
only
seems
to
follow
would
you
like
to
say
that
the
ideas
are
really
divisible
and
yet
remain
one
not
you
venture
to
affirm
that
great
objects
have
a
portion
only
of
greatness
transferred
to
them
or
that
small
or
equal
objects
are
small
or
equal
because
they
are
only
portions
of
smallness
or
equality
how
can
individuals
participate
in
ideas
except
in
the
ways
which
i
have
mentioned
is
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
should
imagine
the
conception
of
ideas
to
arise
as
follows
you
see
great
objects
pervaded
by
a
common
form
or
idea
of
greatness
which
you
abstract
is
quite
true
supposing
you
embrace
in
one
view
the
idea
of
greatness
thus
gained
and
the
individuals
which
it
comprises
a
further
idea
of
greatness
arises
which
makes
both
great
and
this
may
go
on
to
infinity
socrates
replies
that
the
ideas
may
be
thoughts
in
the
mind
only
in
this
case
the
consequence
would
no
longer
follow
must
not
the
thought
be
of
something
which
is
the
same
in
all
and
is
the
idea
and
if
the
world
partakes
in
the
ideas
and
the
ideas
are
thoughts
must
not
all
things
think
or
can
thought
be
without
thought
acknowledge
the
unmeaningness
of
this
says
socrates
would
rather
have
recourse
to
the
explanation
that
the
ideas
are
types
in
nature
and
that
other
things
partake
of
them
by
becoming
like
them
to
become
like
them
is
to
be
comprehended
in
the
same
idea
and
the
likeness
of
the
idea
and
the
individuals
implies
another
idea
of
likeness
and
another
without
end
true
theory
then
of
participation
by
likeness
has
to
be
given
up
you
have
hardly
yet
socrates
found
out
the
real
difficulty
of
maintaining
abstract
ideas
difficulty
greatest
of
all
perhaps
is
this
an
opponent
will
argue
that
the
ideas
are
not
within
the
range
of
human
knowledge
and
you
can
not
disprove
the
assertion
without
a
long
and
laborious
demonstration
which
he
may
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
follow
in
the
first
place
neither
you
nor
any
one
who
maintains
the
existence
of
absolute
ideas
will
affirm
that
they
are
subjective
would
be
a
contradiction
and
therefore
any
relation
in
these
ideas
is
a
relation
which
concerns
themselves
only
and
the
objects
which
are
named
after
them
are
relative
to
one
another
only
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
ideas
themselves
do
you
mean
said
socrates
may
illustrate
my
meaning
in
this
way
one
of
us
has
a
slave
and
the
idea
of
a
slave
in
the
abstract
is
relative
to
the
idea
of
a
master
in
the
abstract
this
correspondence
of
ideas
however
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
relation
of
our
slave
to
do
you
see
my
meaning
absolute
knowledge
in
the
same
way
corresponds
to
absolute
truth
and
being
and
particular
knowledge
to
particular
truth
and
being
clearly
there
is
a
subjective
knowledge
which
is
of
subjective
truth
having
many
kinds
general
and
particular
but
the
ideas
themselves
are
not
subjective
and
therefore
are
not
within
our
ken
are
not
the
beautiful
and
the
good
in
their
own
nature
are
unknown
to
us
would
seem
so
is
a
worse
consequence
yet
is
that
think
we
must
admit
that
absolute
knowledge
is
the
most
exact
knowledge
which
we
must
therefore
attribute
to
god
but
then
see
what
follows
god
having
this
exact
knowledge
can
have
no
knowledge
of
human
things
as
we
have
divided
the
two
spheres
and
forbidden
any
passing
from
one
to
the
other
the
gods
have
knowledge
and
authority
in
their
world
only
as
we
have
in
ours
surely
to
deprive
god
of
knowledge
is
monstrous
are
some
of
the
difficulties
which
are
involved
in
the
assumption
of
absolute
ideas
the
learner
will
find
them
nearly
impossible
to
understand
and
the
teacher
who
has
to
impart
them
will
require
superhuman
ability
there
will
always
be
a
suspicion
either
that
they
have
no
existence
or
are
beyond
human
knowledge
i
agree
with
you
said
socrates
if
these
difficulties
induce
you
to
give
up
universal
ideas
what
becomes
of
the
mind
and
where
are
the
reasoning
and
reflecting
powers
philosophy
is
at
an
end
certainly
do
not
see
my
way
think
said
parmenides
this
arises
out
of
your
attempting
to
define
abstractions
such
as
the
good
and
the
beautiful
and
the
just
before
you
have
had
sufficient
previous
training
i
noticed
your
deficiency
when
you
were
talking
with
aristoteles
the
day
before
yesterday
your
enthusiasm
is
a
wonderful
gift
but
i
fear
that
unless
you
discipline
yourself
by
dialectic
while
you
are
young
truth
will
elude
your
grasp
what
kind
of
discipline
would
you
recommend
training
which
you
heard
zeno
practising
at
the
same
time
i
admire
your
saying
to
him
that
you
did
not
care
to
consider
the
difficulty
in
reference
to
visible
objects
but
only
in
relation
to
ideas
because
i
think
that
in
visible
objects
you
may
easily
show
any
number
of
inconsistent
consequences
and
you
should
consider
not
only
the
consequences
which
follow
from
a
given
hypothesis
but
the
consequences
also
which
follow
from
the
denial
of
the
hypothesis
for
example
what
follows
from
the
assumption
of
the
existence
of
the
many
and
the
of
what
follows
from
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
the
many
and
similarly
of
likeness
and
unlikeness
motion
rest
generation
corruption
being
and
not
being
and
the
consequences
must
include
consequences
to
the
things
supposed
and
to
other
things
in
themselves
and
in
relation
to
one
another
to
individuals
whom
you
select
to
the
many
and
to
the
all
these
must
be
drawn
out
both
on
the
affirmative
and
on
the
negative
hypothesis
that
is
if
you
are
to
train
yourself
perfectly
to
the
intelligence
of
the
truth
you
are
suggesting
seems
to
be
a
tremendous
process
and
one
of
which
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
nature
said
socrates
you
give
me
an
example
must
not
impose
such
a
task
on
a
man
of
my
years
said
parmenides
will
you
zeno
us
rather
said
zeno
with
a
smile
parmenides
for
the
undertaking
is
a
serious
one
as
he
truly
says
nor
could
i
urge
him
to
make
the
attempt
except
in
a
select
audience
of
persons
who
will
understand
him
the
whole
party
joined
in
the
request
here
we
have
first
of
all
an
unmistakable
attack
made
by
the
youthful
socrates
on
the
paradoxes
of
zeno
he
perfectly
understands
their
drift
and
zeno
himself
is
supposed
to
admit
this
but
they
appear
to
him
as
he
says
in
the
philebus
also
to
be
rather
truisms
than
paradoxes
for
every
one
must
acknowledge
the
obvious
fact
that
the
body
being
one
has
many
members
and
that
in
a
thousand
ways
the
like
partakes
of
the
unlike
the
many
of
the
one
the
real
difficulty
begins
with
the
relations
of
ideas
in
themselves
whether
of
the
one
and
many
or
of
any
other
ideas
to
one
another
and
to
the
mind
but
this
was
a
problem
which
the
eleatic
philosophers
had
never
considered
their
thoughts
had
not
gone
beyond
the
contradictions
of
matter
motion
space
and
the
like
it
was
no
wonder
that
parmenides
and
zeno
should
hear
the
novel
speculations
of
socrates
with
mixed
feelings
of
admiration
and
displeasure
he
was
going
out
of
the
received
circle
of
disputation
into
a
region
in
which
they
could
hardly
follow
him
from
the
crude
idea
of
being
in
the
abstract
he
was
about
to
proceed
to
universals
or
general
notions
there
is
no
contradiction
in
material
things
partaking
of
the
ideas
of
one
and
many
neither
is
there
any
contradiction
in
the
ideas
of
one
and
many
like
and
unlike
in
themselves
but
the
contradiction
arises
when
we
attempt
to
conceive
ideas
in
their
connexion
or
to
ascertain
their
relation
to
phenomena
still
he
affirms
the
existence
of
such
ideas
and
this
is
the
position
which
is
now
in
turn
submitted
to
the
criticisms
of
parmenides
to
appreciate
truly
the
character
of
these
criticisms
we
must
remember
the
place
held
by
parmenides
in
the
history
of
greek
philosophy
he
is
the
founder
of
idealism
and
also
of
dialectic
or
in
modern
phraseology
of
metaphysics
and
logic
like
plato
he
is
struggling
after
something
wider
and
deeper
than
satisfied
the
contemporary
pythagoreans
and
plato
with
a
true
instinct
recognizes
him
as
his
spiritual
father
whom
he
and
honoured
more
than
all
other
philosophers
together
he
may
be
supposed
to
have
thought
more
than
he
said
or
was
able
to
express
and
although
he
could
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
have
criticized
the
ideas
of
plato
without
an
anachronism
the
criticism
is
appropriately
placed
in
the
mouth
of
the
founder
of
the
ideal
philosophy
there
was
probably
a
time
in
the
life
of
plato
when
the
ethical
teaching
of
socrates
came
into
conflict
with
the
metaphysical
theories
of
the
earlier
philosophers
and
he
sought
to
supplement
the
one
by
the
other
the
older
philosophers
were
great
and
awful
and
they
had
the
charm
of
antiquity
something
which
found
a
response
in
his
own
mind
seemed
to
have
been
lost
as
well
as
gained
in
the
socratic
dialectic
he
felt
no
incongruity
in
the
veteran
parmenides
correcting
the
youthful
socrates
two
points
in
his
criticism
are
especially
deserving
of
notice
first
of
all
parmenides
tries
him
by
the
test
of
consistency
socrates
is
willing
to
assume
ideas
or
principles
of
the
just
the
beautiful
the
good
and
to
extend
them
to
man
compare
phaedo
but
he
is
reluctant
to
admit
that
there
are
general
ideas
of
hair
mud
filth
etc
there
is
an
ethical
universal
or
idea
but
is
there
also
a
universal
of
physics
of
the
meanest
things
in
the
world
as
well
as
of
the
greatest
parmenides
rebukes
this
want
of
consistency
in
socrates
which
he
attributes
to
his
youth
as
he
grows
older
philosophy
will
take
a
firmer
hold
of
him
and
then
he
will
despise
neither
great
things
nor
small
and
he
will
think
less
of
the
opinions
of
mankind
compare
here
is
lightly
touched
one
of
the
most
familiar
principles
of
modern
philosophy
that
in
the
meanest
operations
of
nature
as
well
as
in
the
noblest
in
mud
and
filth
as
well
as
in
the
sun
and
stars
great
truths
are
contained
at
the
same
time
we
may
note
also
the
transition
in
the
mind
of
plato
to
which
aristotle
alludes
met
when
as
he
says
he
transferred
the
socratic
universal
of
ethics
to
the
whole
of
nature
the
other
criticism
of
parmenides
on
socrates
attributes
to
him
a
want
of
practice
in
dialectic
he
has
observed
this
deficiency
in
him
when
talking
to
aristoteles
on
a
previous
occasion
plato
seems
to
imply
that
there
was
something
more
in
the
dialectic
of
zeno
than
in
the
mere
interrogation
of
socrates
here
again
he
may
perhaps
be
describing
the
process
which
his
own
mind
went
through
when
he
first
became
more
intimately
acquainted
whether
at
megara
or
elsewhere
with
the
eleatic
and
megarian
philosophers
still
parmenides
does
not
deny
to
socrates
the
credit
of
having
gone
beyond
them
in
seeking
to
apply
the
paradoxes
of
zeno
to
ideas
and
this
is
the
application
which
he
himself
makes
of
them
in
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
he
then
proceeds
to
explain
to
him
the
sort
of
mental
gymnastic
which
he
should
practise
he
should
consider
not
only
what
would
follow
from
a
given
hypothesis
but
what
would
follow
from
the
denial
of
it
to
that
which
is
the
subject
of
the
hypothesis
and
to
all
other
things
there
is
no
trace
in
the
memorabilia
of
xenophon
of
any
such
method
being
attributed
to
socrates
nor
is
the
dialectic
here
spoken
of
that
method
of
proceeding
by
regular
divisions
which
is
described
in
the
phaedrus
and
philebus
and
of
which
examples
are
given
in
the
politicus
and
in
the
sophist
it
is
expressly
spoken
of
as
the
method
which
socrates
had
heard
zeno
practise
in
the
days
of
his
youth
compare
the
discussion
of
socrates
with
parmenides
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
passages
in
plato
few
writers
have
ever
been
able
to
anticipate
criticism
of
the
morrow
on
their
favourite
notions
but
plato
may
here
be
said
to
anticipate
the
judgment
not
only
of
the
morrow
but
of
all
on
the
platonic
ideas
for
in
some
points
he
touches
questions
which
have
not
yet
received
their
solution
in
modern
philosophy
the
first
difficulty
which
parmenides
raises
respecting
the
platonic
ideas
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
individuals
are
connected
with
them
do
they
participate
in
the
ideas
or
do
they
merely
resemble
them
parmenides
shows
that
objections
may
be
urged
against
either
of
these
modes
of
conceiving
the
connection
things
are
little
by
partaking
of
littleness
great
by
partaking
of
greatness
and
the
like
but
they
can
not
partake
of
a
part
of
greatness
for
that
will
not
make
them
great
etc
nor
can
each
object
monopolise
the
whole
the
only
answer
to
this
is
that
is
a
figure
of
speech
really
corresponding
to
the
processes
which
a
later
logic
designates
by
the
terms
and
when
we
have
described
accurately
the
methods
or
forms
which
the
mind
employs
we
can
not
further
criticize
them
at
least
we
can
only
criticize
them
with
reference
to
their
fitness
as
instruments
of
thought
to
express
facts
socrates
attempts
to
support
his
view
of
the
ideas
by
the
parallel
of
the
day
which
is
one
and
in
many
places
but
he
is
easily
driven
from
his
position
by
a
counter
illustration
of
parmenides
who
compares
the
idea
of
greatness
to
a
sail
he
truly
explains
to
socrates
that
he
has
attained
the
conception
of
ideas
by
a
process
of
generalization
at
the
same
time
he
points
out
a
difficulty
which
appears
to
be
involved
viz
that
the
process
of
generalization
will
go
on
to
infinity
socrates
meets
the
supposed
difficulty
by
a
flash
of
light
which
is
indeed
the
true
answer
the
ideas
are
in
our
minds
only
neither
realism
is
the
truth
nor
nominalism
is
the
truth
but
conceptualism
and
conceptualism
or
any
other
psychological
theory
falls
very
far
short
of
the
infinite
subtlety
of
language
and
thought
but
the
realism
of
ancient
philosophy
will
not
admit
of
this
answer
which
is
repelled
by
parmenides
with
another
truth
or
of
later
philosophy
subject
or
subjective
must
have
an
object
here
is
the
great
though
unconscious
truth
shall
we
say
or
error
which
underlay
the
early
greek
philosophy
must
have
a
real
existence
they
are
not
mere
forms
or
opinions
which
may
be
changed
arbitrarily
by
individuals
but
the
early
greek
philosopher
never
clearly
saw
that
true
ideas
were
only
universal
facts
and
that
there
might
be
error
in
universals
as
well
as
in
particulars
socrates
makes
one
more
attempt
to
defend
the
platonic
ideas
by
representing
them
as
paradigms
this
is
again
answered
by
the
ad
infinitum
we
may
remark
in
passing
that
the
process
which
is
thus
described
has
no
real
existence
the
mind
after
having
obtained
a
general
idea
does
not
really
go
on
to
form
another
which
includes
that
and
all
the
individuals
contained
under
it
and
another
and
another
without
end
the
difficulty
belongs
in
fact
to
the
megarian
age
of
philosophy
and
is
due
to
their
illogical
logic
and
to
the
general
ignorance
of
the
ancients
respecting
the
part
played
by
language
in
the
process
of
thought
no
such
perplexity
could
ever
trouble
a
modern
metaphysician
any
more
than
the
fallacy
of
or
or
of
and
the
tortoise
these
of
metaphysics
ought
to
occasion
no
more
difficulty
in
speculation
than
a
perpetually
recurring
fraction
in
arithmetic
it
is
otherwise
with
the
objection
which
follows
how
are
we
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
human
truth
and
absolute
truth
between
gods
and
men
this
is
the
difficulty
of
philosophy
in
all
ages
how
can
we
get
beyond
the
circle
of
our
own
ideas
or
how
remaining
within
them
can
we
have
any
criterion
of
a
truth
beyond
and
independent
of
them
parmenides
draws
out
this
difficulty
with
great
clearness
according
to
him
there
are
not
only
one
but
two
chasms
the
first
between
individuals
and
the
ideas
which
have
a
common
name
the
second
between
the
ideas
in
us
and
the
ideas
absolute
the
first
of
these
two
difficulties
mankind
as
we
may
say
a
little
parodying
the
language
of
the
philebus
have
long
agreed
to
treat
as
obsolete
the
second
remains
a
difficulty
for
us
as
well
as
for
the
greeks
of
the
fourth
century
before
christ
and
is
the
of
kant
kritik
and
of
the
hamiltonian
adaptation
of
kant
as
well
as
of
the
platonic
ideas
it
has
been
said
that
can
not
criticize
revelation
how
do
you
know
what
is
revelation
or
that
there
is
one
at
all
is
the
immediate
rejoinder
know
nothing
of
things
in
themselves
how
do
you
know
that
there
are
things
in
themselves
in
some
respects
the
difficulty
pressed
harder
upon
the
greek
than
upon
ourselves
for
conceiving
of
god
more
under
the
attribute
of
knowledge
than
we
do
he
was
more
under
the
necessity
of
separating
the
divine
from
the
human
as
two
spheres
which
had
no
communication
with
one
another
it
is
remarkable
that
plato
speaking
by
the
mouth
of
parmenides
does
not
treat
even
this
second
class
of
difficulties
as
hopeless
or
insoluble
he
says
only
that
they
can
not
be
explained
without
a
long
and
laborious
demonstration
teacher
will
require
superhuman
ability
and
the
learner
will
be
hard
of
understanding
but
an
attempt
must
be
made
to
find
an
answer
to
them
for
as
socrates
and
parmenides
both
admit
the
denial
of
abstract
ideas
is
the
destruction
of
the
mind
we
can
easily
imagine
that
among
the
greek
schools
of
philosophy
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
a
panic
might
arise
from
the
denial
of
universals
similar
to
that
which
arose
in
the
last
century
from
denial
of
our
ideas
of
cause
and
effect
men
do
not
at
first
recognize
that
thought
like
digestion
will
go
on
much
the
same
notwithstanding
any
theories
which
may
be
entertained
respecting
the
nature
of
the
process
parmenides
attributes
the
difficulties
in
which
socrates
is
involved
to
a
want
of
comprehensiveness
in
his
mode
of
reasoning
he
should
consider
every
question
on
the
negative
as
well
as
the
positive
hypothesis
with
reference
to
the
consequences
which
flow
from
the
denial
as
well
as
from
the
assertion
of
a
given
statement
the
argument
which
follows
is
the
most
singular
in
plato
it
appears
to
be
an
imitation
or
parody
of
the
zenonian
dialectic
just
as
the
speeches
in
the
phaedrus
are
an
imitation
of
the
style
of
lysias
or
as
the
derivations
in
the
cratylus
or
the
fallacies
of
the
euthydemus
are
a
parody
of
some
contemporary
sophist
the
interlocutor
is
not
supposed
as
in
most
of
the
other
platonic
dialogues
to
take
a
living
part
in
the
argument
he
is
only
required
to
say
and
in
the
right
places
a
hint
has
been
already
given
that
the
paradoxes
of
zeno
admitted
of
a
higher
application
this
hint
is
the
thread
by
which
plato
connects
the
two
parts
of
the
dialogue
the
paradoxes
of
parmenides
seem
trivial
to
us
because
the
words
to
which
they
relate
have
become
trivial
their
true
nature
as
abstract
terms
is
perfectly
understood
by
us
and
we
are
inclined
to
regard
the
treatment
of
them
in
plato
as
a
mere
or
legerdemain
of
words
yet
there
was
a
power
in
them
which
fascinated
the
neoplatonists
for
centuries
afterwards
something
that
they
found
in
them
or
brought
to
them
some
echo
or
anticipation
of
a
great
truth
or
error
exercised
a
wonderful
influence
over
their
minds
to
do
the
parmenides
justice
we
should
imagine
similar
aporiai
raised
on
themes
as
sacred
to
us
as
the
notions
of
one
or
being
were
to
an
ancient
eleatic
god
is
what
follows
if
god
is
not
what
follows
or
again
if
god
is
or
is
not
the
world
or
if
god
is
or
is
not
many
or
has
or
has
not
parts
or
is
or
is
not
in
the
world
or
in
time
or
is
or
is
not
finite
or
infinite
or
if
the
world
is
or
is
not
or
has
or
has
not
a
beginning
or
end
or
is
or
is
not
infinite
or
infinitely
divisible
or
again
if
god
is
or
is
not
identical
with
his
laws
or
if
man
is
or
is
not
identical
with
the
laws
of
nature
we
can
easily
see
that
here
are
many
subjects
for
thought
and
that
from
these
and
similar
hypotheses
questions
of
great
interest
might
arise
and
we
also
remark
that
the
conclusions
derived
from
either
of
the
two
alternative
propositions
might
be
equally
impossible
and
contradictory
when
we
ask
what
is
the
object
of
these
paradoxes
some
have
answered
that
they
are
a
mere
logical
puzzle
while
others
have
seen
in
them
an
hegelian
propaedeutic
of
the
doctrine
of
ideas
the
first
of
these
views
derives
support
from
the
manner
in
which
parmenides
speaks
of
a
similar
method
being
applied
to
all
ideas
yet
it
is
hard
to
suppose
that
plato
would
have
furnished
so
elaborate
an
example
not
of
his
own
but
of
the
eleatic
dialectic
had
he
intended
only
to
give
an
illustration
of
method
the
second
view
has
been
often
overstated
by
those
who
like
hegel
himself
have
tended
to
confuse
ancient
with
modern
philosophy
we
need
not
deny
that
plato
trained
in
the
school
of
cratylus
and
heracleitus
may
have
seen
that
a
contradiction
in
terms
is
sometimes
the
best
expression
of
a
truth
higher
than
either
compare
but
his
ideal
theory
is
not
based
on
antinomies
the
correlation
of
ideas
was
the
metaphysical
difficulty
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
the
megarian
and
cynic
philosophy
was
a
ad
absurdum
of
their
isolation
to
restore
them
to
their
natural
connexion
and
to
detect
the
negative
element
in
them
is
the
aim
of
plato
in
the
sophist
but
his
view
of
their
connexion
falls
very
far
short
of
the
hegelian
identity
of
being
and
the
being
and
of
plato
never
merge
in
each
other
though
he
is
aware
that
is
only
negation
after
criticizing
the
hypotheses
of
others
it
may
appear
presumptuous
to
add
another
guess
to
the
many
which
have
been
already
offered
may
we
say
in
platonic
language
that
we
still
seem
to
see
vestiges
of
a
track
which
has
not
yet
been
taken
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
obscurity
of
the
parmenides
would
not
have
existed
to
a
contemporary
student
of
philosophy
and
like
the
similar
difficulty
in
the
philebus
is
really
due
to
our
ignorance
of
the
mind
of
the
age
there
is
an
obscure
megarian
influence
on
plato
which
can
not
wholly
be
cleared
up
and
is
not
much
illustrated
by
the
doubtful
tradition
of
his
retirement
to
megara
after
the
death
of
socrates
for
megara
was
within
a
walk
of
athens
phaedr
and
plato
might
have
learned
the
megarian
doctrines
without
settling
there
we
may
begin
by
remarking
that
the
theses
of
parmenides
are
expressly
said
to
follow
the
method
of
zeno
and
that
the
complex
dilemma
though
declared
to
be
capable
of
universal
application
is
applied
in
this
instance
to
zeno
familiar
question
of
the
and
many
here
then
is
a
double
indication
of
the
connexion
of
the
parmenides
with
the
eristic
school
the
old
eleatics
had
asserted
the
existence
of
being
which
they
at
first
regarded
as
finite
then
as
infinite
then
as
neither
finite
nor
infinite
to
which
some
of
them
had
given
what
aristotle
calls
form
others
had
ascribed
a
material
nature
only
the
tendency
of
their
philosophy
was
to
deny
to
being
all
predicates
the
megarians
who
succeeded
them
like
the
cynics
affirmed
that
no
predicate
could
be
asserted
of
any
subject
they
also
converted
the
idea
of
being
into
an
abstraction
of
good
perhaps
with
the
view
of
preserving
a
sort
of
neutrality
or
indifference
between
the
mind
and
things
as
if
they
had
said
in
the
language
of
modern
philosophy
is
not
only
neither
finite
nor
infinite
neither
at
rest
nor
in
motion
but
neither
subjective
nor
objective
this
is
the
track
along
which
plato
is
leading
us
zeno
had
attempted
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
one
by
disproving
the
existence
of
the
many
and
parmenides
seems
to
aim
at
proving
the
existence
of
the
subject
by
showing
the
contradictions
which
follow
from
the
assertion
of
any
predicates
take
the
simplest
of
all
notions
you
can
not
even
assert
being
or
time
of
this
without
involving
a
contradiction
but
is
the
contradiction
also
the
final
conclusion
probably
no
more
than
of
zeno
denial
of
the
many
or
of
parmenides
assault
upon
the
ideas
no
more
than
of
the
earlier
dialogues
search
to
us
there
seems
to
be
no
residuum
of
this
long
piece
of
dialectics
but
to
the
mind
of
parmenides
and
plato
menschen
there
still
remained
the
idea
of
or
which
could
not
be
conceived
defined
uttered
but
could
not
be
got
rid
of
neither
of
them
would
have
imagined
that
their
disputation
ever
touched
the
divine
being
compare
the
same
difficulties
about
unity
and
being
are
raised
in
the
sophist
but
there
only
as
preliminary
to
their
final
solution
if
this
view
is
correct
the
real
aim
of
the
hypotheses
of
parmenides
is
to
criticize
the
earlier
eleatic
philosophy
from
the
point
of
view
of
zeno
or
the
megarians
it
is
the
same
kind
of
criticism
which
plato
has
extended
to
his
own
doctrine
of
ideas
nor
is
there
any
want
of
poetical
consistency
in
attributing
to
the
parmenides
the
last
review
of
the
eleatic
doctrines
the
latest
phases
of
all
philosophies
were
fathered
upon
the
founder
of
the
school
other
critics
have
regarded
the
final
conclusion
of
the
parmenides
either
as
sceptical
or
as
heracleitean
in
the
first
case
they
assume
that
plato
means
to
show
the
impossibility
of
any
truth
but
this
is
not
the
spirit
of
plato
and
could
not
with
propriety
be
put
into
the
mouth
of
parmenides
who
in
this
very
dialogue
is
urging
socrates
not
to
doubt
everything
but
to
discipline
his
mind
with
a
view
to
the
more
precise
attainment
of
truth
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
second
of
the
two
theories
plato
everywhere
ridicules
perhaps
unfairly
his
heracleitean
contemporaries
and
if
he
had
intended
to
support
an
heracleitean
thesis
would
hardly
have
chosen
parmenides
the
condemner
of
the
tribe
who
say
that
things
both
are
and
are
not
to
be
the
speaker
nor
thirdly
can
we
easily
persuade
ourselves
with
zeller
that
by
the
he
means
the
idea
and
that
he
is
seeking
to
prove
indirectly
the
unity
of
the
idea
in
the
multiplicity
of
phenomena
we
may
now
endeavour
to
thread
the
mazes
of
the
labyrinth
which
parmenides
knew
so
well
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
them
the
argument
has
two
divisions
there
is
the
hypothesis
that
one
is
one
is
not
if
one
is
it
is
nothing
if
one
is
not
it
is
everything
but
is
and
is
not
may
be
taken
in
two
senses
either
one
is
one
or
one
has
being
from
which
opposite
consequences
are
deduced
if
one
is
one
it
is
nothing
if
one
has
being
it
is
all
things
to
which
are
appended
two
subordinate
consequences
if
one
has
being
all
other
things
are
if
one
is
one
all
other
things
are
not
the
same
distinction
is
then
applied
to
the
negative
hypothesis
if
one
is
not
one
it
is
all
things
if
one
has
not
being
it
is
nothing
involving
two
parallel
consequences
respecting
the
other
or
remainder
if
one
is
not
one
other
things
are
all
if
one
has
not
being
other
things
are
not
can
not
refuse
said
parmenides
as
zeno
remarks
we
are
alone
though
i
may
say
with
ibycus
who
in
his
old
age
fell
in
love
i
like
the
old
racehorse
tremble
at
the
prospect
of
the
course
which
i
am
to
run
and
which
i
know
so
well
but
as
i
must
attempt
this
laborious
game
what
shall
be
the
subject
suppose
i
take
my
own
hypothesis
of
the
one
all
means
said
zeno
who
will
answer
me
shall
i
propose
the
youngest
he
will
be
the
most
likely
to
say
what
he
thinks
and
his
answers
will
give
me
time
to
breathe
am
the
youngest
said
aristoteles
at
your
service
proceed
with
your
questions
the
result
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
one
is
not
many
and
therefore
has
no
parts
and
therefore
is
not
a
whole
which
is
a
sum
of
parts
and
therefore
has
neither
beginning
middle
nor
end
and
is
therefore
unlimited
and
therefore
formless
being
neither
round
nor
straight
for
neither
round
nor
straight
can
be
defined
without
assuming
that
they
have
parts
and
therefore
is
not
in
place
whether
in
another
which
would
encircle
and
touch
the
one
at
many
points
or
in
itself
because
that
which
is
is
also
contained
and
therefore
not
one
but
two
this
being
premised
let
us
consider
whether
one
is
capable
either
of
motion
or
rest
for
motion
is
either
change
of
substance
or
motion
on
an
axis
or
from
one
place
to
another
but
the
one
is
incapable
of
change
of
substance
which
implies
that
it
ceases
to
be
itself
or
of
motion
on
an
axis
because
there
would
be
parts
around
the
axis
and
any
other
motion
involves
change
of
place
but
existence
in
place
has
been
already
shown
to
be
impossible
and
yet
more
impossible
is
coming
into
being
in
place
which
implies
partial
existence
in
two
places
at
once
or
entire
existence
neither
within
nor
without
the
same
and
how
can
this
be
and
more
impossible
still
is
the
coming
into
being
either
as
a
whole
or
parts
of
that
which
is
neither
a
whole
nor
parts
the
one
then
is
incapable
of
motion
but
neither
can
the
one
be
in
anything
and
therefore
not
in
the
same
whether
itself
or
some
other
and
is
therefore
incapable
of
rest
neither
is
one
the
same
with
itself
or
any
other
or
other
than
itself
or
any
other
for
if
other
than
itself
then
other
than
one
and
therefore
not
one
and
if
the
same
with
other
it
would
be
other
and
other
than
one
neither
can
one
while
remaining
one
be
other
than
other
for
other
and
not
one
is
the
other
than
other
but
if
not
other
by
virtue
of
being
one
not
by
virtue
of
itself
and
if
not
by
virtue
of
itself
not
itself
other
and
if
not
itself
other
not
other
than
anything
neither
will
one
be
the
same
with
itself
for
the
nature
of
the
same
is
not
that
of
the
one
but
a
thing
which
becomes
the
same
with
anything
does
not
become
one
for
example
that
which
becomes
the
same
with
the
many
becomes
many
and
not
one
and
therefore
if
the
one
is
the
same
with
itself
the
one
is
not
one
with
itself
and
therefore
one
and
not
one
and
therefore
one
is
neither
other
than
other
nor
the
same
with
itself
neither
will
the
one
be
like
or
unlike
itself
or
other
for
likeness
is
sameness
of
affections
and
the
one
and
the
same
are
different
and
one
having
any
affection
which
is
other
than
being
one
would
be
more
than
one
the
one
then
can
not
have
the
same
affection
with
and
therefore
can
not
be
like
itself
or
other
nor
can
the
one
have
any
other
affection
than
its
own
that
is
be
unlike
itself
or
any
other
for
this
would
imply
that
it
was
more
than
one
the
one
then
is
neither
like
nor
unlike
itself
or
other
this
being
the
case
neither
can
the
one
be
equal
or
unequal
to
itself
or
other
for
equality
implies
sameness
of
measure
as
inequality
implies
a
greater
or
less
number
of
measures
but
the
one
not
having
sameness
can
not
have
sameness
of
measure
nor
a
greater
or
less
number
of
measures
for
that
would
imply
parts
and
multitude
once
more
can
one
be
older
or
younger
than
itself
or
other
or
of
the
same
age
with
itself
or
other
that
would
imply
likeness
and
unlikeness
equality
and
inequality
therefore
one
can
not
be
in
time
because
that
which
is
in
time
is
ever
becoming
older
and
younger
than
itself
for
older
and
younger
are
relative
terms
and
he
who
becomes
older
becomes
younger
and
is
also
of
the
same
age
with
itself
none
of
which
or
any
other
expressions
of
time
whether
past
future
or
present
can
be
affirmed
of
one
one
neither
is
has
been
nor
will
be
nor
becomes
nor
has
nor
will
become
and
as
these
are
the
only
modes
of
being
one
is
not
and
is
not
one
but
to
that
which
is
not
there
is
no
attribute
or
relative
neither
name
nor
word
nor
idea
nor
science
nor
perception
nor
opinion
appertaining
one
then
is
neither
named
nor
uttered
nor
known
nor
perceived
nor
imagined
but
can
all
this
be
true
think
not
let
us
however
commence
the
inquiry
again
we
have
to
work
out
all
the
consequences
which
follow
on
the
assumption
that
the
one
is
if
one
is
one
partakes
of
being
which
is
not
the
same
with
one
the
words
and
have
different
meanings
observe
the
consequence
in
the
one
of
being
or
the
being
of
one
are
two
parts
being
and
one
which
form
one
whole
and
each
of
the
two
parts
is
also
a
whole
and
involves
the
other
and
may
be
further
subdivided
into
one
and
being
and
is
therefore
not
one
but
two
and
thus
one
is
never
one
and
in
this
way
the
one
if
it
is
becomes
many
and
infinite
again
let
us
conceive
of
a
one
which
by
an
effort
of
abstraction
we
separate
from
being
will
this
abstract
one
be
one
or
many
you
say
one
only
let
us
see
in
the
first
place
the
being
of
one
is
other
than
one
and
one
and
being
if
different
are
so
because
they
both
partake
of
the
nature
of
other
which
is
therefore
neither
one
nor
being
and
whether
we
take
being
and
other
or
being
and
one
or
one
and
other
in
any
case
we
have
two
things
which
separately
are
called
either
and
together
both
and
both
are
two
and
either
of
two
is
severally
one
and
if
one
be
added
to
any
of
the
pairs
the
sum
is
three
and
two
is
an
even
number
three
an
odd
and
two
units
exist
twice
and
therefore
there
are
twice
two
and
three
units
exist
thrice
and
therefore
there
are
thrice
three
and
taken
together
they
give
twice
three
and
thrice
two
we
have
even
numbers
multiplied
into
even
and
odd
into
even
and
even
into
odd
numbers
but
if
one
is
and
both
odd
and
even
numbers
are
implied
in
one
must
not
every
number
exist
and
number
is
infinite
and
therefore
existence
must
be
infinite
for
all
and
every
number
partakes
of
being
therefore
being
has
the
greatest
number
of
parts
and
every
part
however
great
or
however
small
is
equally
one
but
can
one
be
in
many
places
and
yet
be
a
whole
if
not
a
whole
it
must
be
divided
into
parts
and
represented
by
a
number
corresponding
to
the
number
of
the
parts
and
if
so
we
were
wrong
in
saying
that
being
has
the
greatest
number
of
parts
for
being
is
coequal
and
coextensive
with
one
and
has
no
more
parts
than
one
and
so
the
abstract
one
broken
up
into
parts
by
being
is
many
and
infinite
but
the
parts
are
parts
of
a
whole
and
the
whole
is
their
containing
limit
and
the
one
is
therefore
limited
as
well
as
infinite
in
number
and
that
which
is
a
whole
has
beginning
middle
and
end
and
a
middle
is
equidistant
from
the
extremes
and
one
is
therefore
of
a
certain
figure
round
or
straight
or
a
combination
of
the
two
and
being
a
whole
includes
all
the
parts
which
are
the
whole
and
is
therefore
but
then
again
the
whole
is
not
in
the
parts
whether
all
or
some
not
in
all
because
if
in
all
also
in
one
for
if
wanting
in
any
one
how
in
all
not
in
some
because
the
greater
would
then
be
contained
in
the
less
but
if
not
in
all
nor
in
any
nor
in
some
either
nowhere
or
in
other
and
if
nowhere
nothing
therefore
in
other
the
one
as
a
whole
then
is
in
another
but
regarded
as
a
sum
of
parts
is
in
itself
and
is
therefore
both
in
itself
and
in
another
this
being
the
case
the
one
is
at
once
both
at
rest
and
in
motion
at
rest
because
resting
in
itself
in
motion
because
it
is
ever
in
other
and
if
there
is
truth
in
what
has
preceded
one
is
the
same
and
not
the
same
with
itself
and
other
for
everything
in
relation
to
every
other
thing
is
either
the
same
with
it
or
other
or
if
neither
the
same
nor
other
then
in
the
relation
of
part
to
a
whole
or
whole
to
a
part
but
one
can
not
be
a
part
or
whole
in
relation
to
one
nor
other
than
one
and
is
therefore
the
same
with
one
yet
this
sameness
is
again
contradicted
by
one
being
in
another
place
from
itself
which
is
in
the
same
place
this
follows
from
one
being
in
itself
and
in
another
one
therefore
is
other
than
itself
but
if
anything
is
other
than
anything
will
it
not
be
other
than
other
and
the
not
one
is
other
than
the
one
and
the
one
than
the
not
one
therefore
one
is
other
than
all
others
but
the
same
and
the
other
exclude
one
another
and
therefore
the
other
can
never
be
in
the
same
nor
can
the
other
be
in
anything
for
ever
so
short
a
time
as
for
that
time
the
other
will
be
in
the
same
and
the
other
if
never
in
the
same
can
not
be
either
in
the
one
or
in
the
not
one
and
one
is
not
other
than
not
one
either
by
reason
of
other
or
of
itself
and
therefore
they
are
not
other
than
one
another
at
all
neither
can
the
not
one
partake
or
be
part
of
one
for
in
that
case
it
would
be
one
nor
can
the
not
one
be
number
for
that
also
involves
one
and
therefore
not
being
other
than
the
one
or
related
to
the
one
as
a
whole
to
parts
or
parts
to
a
whole
not
one
is
the
same
as
one
wherefore
the
one
is
the
same
and
also
not
the
same
with
the
others
and
also
with
itself
and
is
therefore
like
and
unlike
itself
and
the
others
and
just
as
different
from
the
others
as
they
are
from
the
one
neither
more
nor
less
but
if
neither
more
nor
less
equally
different
and
therefore
the
one
and
the
others
have
the
same
relations
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
case
of
names
when
you
repeat
the
same
name
twice
over
you
mean
the
same
thing
and
when
you
say
that
the
other
is
other
than
the
one
or
the
one
other
than
the
other
this
very
word
other
eteron
which
is
attributed
to
both
implies
sameness
one
then
as
being
other
than
others
and
other
as
being
other
than
one
are
alike
in
that
they
have
the
relation
of
otherness
and
likeness
is
similarity
of
relations
and
everything
as
being
other
of
everything
is
also
like
everything
again
same
and
other
like
and
unlike
are
opposites
and
since
in
virtue
of
being
other
than
the
others
the
one
is
like
them
in
virtue
of
being
the
same
it
must
be
unlike
again
one
as
having
the
same
relations
has
no
difference
of
relation
and
is
therefore
not
unlike
and
therefore
like
or
as
having
different
relations
is
different
and
unlike
thus
one
as
being
the
same
and
not
the
same
with
itself
and
others
for
both
these
reasons
and
for
either
of
them
is
also
like
and
unlike
itself
and
the
others
again
how
far
can
one
touch
itself
and
the
others
as
existing
in
others
it
touches
the
others
and
as
existing
in
itself
touches
only
itself
but
from
another
point
of
view
that
which
touches
another
must
be
next
in
order
of
place
one
therefore
must
be
next
in
order
of
place
to
itself
and
would
therefore
be
two
and
in
two
places
but
one
can
not
be
two
and
therefore
can
not
be
in
contact
with
itself
nor
again
can
one
touch
the
other
two
objects
are
required
to
make
one
contact
three
objects
make
two
contacts
and
all
the
objects
in
the
world
if
placed
in
a
series
would
have
as
many
contacts
as
there
are
objects
less
one
but
if
one
only
exists
and
not
two
there
is
no
contact
and
the
others
being
other
than
one
have
no
part
in
one
and
therefore
none
in
number
and
therefore
two
has
no
existence
and
therefore
there
is
no
contact
for
all
which
reasons
one
has
and
has
not
contact
with
itself
and
the
others
once
more
is
one
equal
and
unequal
to
itself
and
the
others
suppose
one
and
the
others
to
be
greater
or
less
than
each
other
or
equal
to
one
another
they
will
be
greater
or
less
or
equal
by
reason
of
equality
or
greatness
or
smallness
inhering
in
them
in
addition
to
their
own
proper
nature
let
us
begin
by
assuming
smallness
to
be
inherent
in
one
in
this
case
the
inherence
is
either
in
the
whole
or
in
a
part
if
the
first
smallness
is
either
coextensive
with
the
whole
one
or
contains
the
whole
and
if
coextensive
with
the
one
is
equal
to
the
one
or
if
containing
the
one
will
be
greater
than
the
one
but
smallness
thus
performs
the
function
of
equality
or
of
greatness
which
is
impossible
again
if
the
inherence
be
in
a
part
the
same
contradiction
follows
smallness
will
be
equal
to
the
part
or
greater
than
the
part
therefore
smallness
will
not
inhere
in
anything
and
except
the
idea
of
smallness
there
will
be
nothing
small
neither
will
greatness
for
greatness
will
have
a
greater
and
there
will
be
no
small
in
relation
to
which
it
is
great
and
there
will
be
no
great
or
small
in
objects
but
greatness
and
smallness
will
be
relative
only
to
each
other
therefore
the
others
can
not
be
greater
or
less
than
the
one
also
the
one
can
neither
exceed
nor
be
exceeded
by
the
others
and
they
are
therefore
equal
to
one
another
and
this
will
be
true
also
of
the
one
in
relation
to
itself
one
will
be
equal
to
itself
as
well
as
to
the
others
talla
yet
one
being
in
itself
must
also
be
about
itself
containing
and
contained
and
is
therefore
greater
and
less
than
itself
further
there
is
nothing
beside
the
one
and
the
others
and
as
these
must
be
in
something
they
must
therefore
be
in
one
another
and
as
that
in
which
a
thing
is
is
greater
than
the
thing
the
inference
is
that
they
are
both
greater
and
less
than
one
another
because
containing
and
contained
in
one
another
therefore
the
one
is
equal
to
and
greater
and
less
than
itself
or
other
having
also
measures
or
parts
or
numbers
equal
to
or
greater
or
less
than
itself
or
other
but
does
one
partake
of
time
this
must
be
acknowledged
if
the
one
partakes
of
being
for
be
is
the
participation
of
being
in
present
time
have
been
in
past
be
about
to
be
in
future
time
and
as
time
is
ever
moving
forward
the
one
becomes
older
than
itself
and
therefore
younger
than
itself
and
is
older
and
also
younger
when
in
the
process
of
becoming
it
arrives
at
the
present
and
it
is
always
older
and
younger
for
at
any
moment
the
one
is
and
therefore
it
becomes
and
is
not
older
and
younger
than
itself
but
during
an
equal
time
with
itself
and
is
therefore
contemporary
with
itself
and
what
are
the
relations
of
the
one
to
the
others
is
it
or
does
it
become
older
or
younger
than
they
at
any
rate
the
others
are
more
than
one
and
one
being
the
least
of
all
numbers
must
be
prior
in
time
to
greater
numbers
but
on
the
other
hand
one
must
come
into
being
in
a
manner
accordant
with
its
own
nature
now
one
has
parts
or
others
and
has
therefore
a
beginning
middle
and
end
of
which
the
beginning
is
first
and
the
end
last
and
the
parts
come
into
existence
first
last
of
all
the
whole
contemporaneously
with
the
end
being
therefore
younger
while
the
parts
or
others
are
older
than
the
one
but
again
the
one
comes
into
being
in
each
of
the
parts
as
much
as
in
the
whole
and
must
be
of
the
same
age
with
them
therefore
one
is
at
once
older
and
younger
than
the
parts
or
others
and
also
contemporaneous
with
them
for
no
part
can
be
a
part
which
is
not
one
is
this
true
of
becoming
as
well
as
being
thus
much
may
be
affirmed
that
the
same
things
which
are
older
or
younger
can
not
become
older
or
younger
in
a
greater
degree
than
they
were
at
first
by
the
addition
of
equal
times
but
on
the
other
hand
the
one
if
older
than
others
has
come
into
being
a
longer
time
than
they
have
and
when
equal
time
is
added
to
a
longer
and
shorter
the
relative
difference
between
them
is
diminished
in
this
way
that
which
was
older
becomes
younger
and
that
which
was
younger
becomes
older
that
is
to
say
younger
and
older
than
at
first
and
they
ever
become
and
never
have
become
for
then
they
would
be
thus
the
one
and
others
always
are
and
are
becoming
and
not
becoming
younger
and
also
older
than
one
another
and
one
partaking
of
time
and
also
partaking
of
becoming
older
and
younger
admits
of
all
time
present
past
and
future
was
is
shall
be
was
becoming
is
becoming
will
become
and
there
is
science
of
the
one
and
opinion
and
name
and
expression
as
is
already
implied
in
the
fact
of
our
inquiry
yet
once
more
if
one
be
one
and
many
and
neither
one
nor
many
and
also
participant
of
time
must
there
not
be
a
time
at
which
one
as
being
one
partakes
of
being
and
a
time
when
one
as
not
being
one
is
deprived
of
being
but
these
two
contradictory
states
can
not
be
experienced
by
the
one
both
together
there
must
be
a
time
of
transition
and
the
transition
is
a
process
of
generation
and
destruction
into
and
from
being
and
the
one
and
the
others
for
the
generation
of
the
one
is
the
destruction
of
the
others
and
the
generation
of
the
others
is
the
destruction
of
the
one
there
is
also
separation
and
aggregation
assimilation
and
dissimilation
increase
diminution
equalization
a
passage
from
motion
to
rest
and
from
rest
to
motion
in
the
one
and
many
but
when
do
all
these
changes
take
place
when
does
motion
become
rest
or
rest
motion
the
answer
to
this
question
will
throw
a
light
upon
all
the
others
nothing
can
be
in
motion
and
at
rest
at
the
same
time
and
therefore
the
change
takes
place
a
moment
which
is
a
strange
expression
and
seems
to
mean
change
in
no
time
which
is
true
also
of
all
the
other
changes
which
likewise
take
place
in
no
time
but
if
one
is
what
happens
to
the
others
which
in
the
first
place
are
not
one
yet
may
partake
of
one
in
a
certain
way
the
others
are
other
than
the
one
because
they
have
parts
for
if
they
had
no
parts
they
would
be
simply
one
and
parts
imply
a
whole
to
which
they
belong
otherwise
each
part
would
be
a
part
of
many
and
being
itself
one
of
them
of
itself
and
if
a
part
of
all
of
each
one
of
the
other
parts
which
is
absurd
for
a
part
if
not
a
part
of
one
must
be
a
part
of
all
but
this
one
and
if
so
not
a
part
of
each
one
and
if
not
a
part
of
each
one
not
a
part
of
any
one
of
many
and
so
not
of
one
and
if
of
none
how
of
all
therefore
a
part
is
neither
a
part
of
many
nor
of
all
but
of
an
absolute
and
perfect
whole
or
one
and
if
the
others
have
parts
they
must
partake
of
the
whole
and
must
be
the
whole
of
which
they
are
the
parts
and
each
part
as
the
word
implies
is
also
an
absolute
one
and
both
the
whole
and
the
parts
partake
of
one
for
the
whole
of
which
the
parts
are
parts
is
one
and
each
part
is
one
part
of
the
whole
and
whole
and
parts
as
participating
in
one
are
other
than
one
and
as
being
other
than
one
are
many
and
infinite
and
however
small
a
fraction
you
separate
from
them
is
many
and
not
one
yet
the
fact
of
their
being
parts
furnishes
the
others
with
a
limit
towards
other
parts
and
towards
the
whole
they
are
finite
and
also
infinite
finite
through
participation
in
the
one
infinite
in
their
own
nature
and
as
being
finite
they
are
alike
and
as
being
infinite
they
are
alike
but
as
being
both
finite
and
also
infinite
they
are
in
the
highest
degree
unlike
and
all
other
opposites
might
without
difficulty
be
shown
to
unite
in
them
once
more
leaving
all
this
is
there
not
also
an
opposite
series
of
consequences
which
is
equally
true
of
the
others
and
may
be
deduced
from
the
existence
of
one
there
is
one
is
distinct
from
the
others
and
the
others
from
one
for
one
and
the
others
are
all
things
and
there
is
no
third
existence
besides
them
and
the
whole
of
one
can
not
be
in
others
nor
parts
of
it
for
it
is
separated
from
others
and
has
no
parts
and
therefore
the
others
have
no
unity
nor
plurality
nor
duality
nor
any
other
number
nor
any
opposition
or
distinction
such
as
likeness
and
unlikeness
some
and
other
generation
and
corruption
odd
and
even
for
if
they
had
these
they
would
partake
either
of
one
opposite
and
this
would
be
a
participation
in
one
or
of
two
opposites
and
this
would
be
a
participation
in
two
thus
if
one
exists
one
is
all
things
and
likewise
nothing
in
relation
to
one
and
to
the
others
but
again
assume
the
opposite
hypothesis
that
the
one
is
not
and
what
is
the
consequence
in
the
first
place
the
proposition
that
one
is
not
is
clearly
opposed
to
the
proposition
that
not
one
is
not
the
subject
of
any
negative
proposition
implies
at
once
knowledge
and
difference
thus
in
the
proposition
one
is
not
must
be
something
known
or
the
words
would
be
unintelligible
and
again
this
which
is
not
is
something
different
from
other
things
moreover
this
and
that
some
and
other
may
be
all
attributed
or
related
to
the
one
which
is
not
and
which
though
may
and
must
have
plurality
if
the
one
only
is
and
nothing
else
but
if
all
is
there
is
nothing
which
can
be
spoken
of
also
the
one
which
is
not
differs
and
is
different
in
kind
from
the
others
and
therefore
unlike
them
and
they
being
other
than
the
one
are
unlike
the
one
which
is
therefore
unlike
them
but
one
being
unlike
other
must
be
like
itself
for
the
unlikeness
of
one
to
itself
is
the
destruction
of
the
hypothesis
and
one
can
not
be
equal
to
the
others
for
that
would
suppose
being
in
the
one
and
the
others
would
be
equal
to
one
and
like
one
both
which
are
impossible
if
one
does
not
exist
the
one
which
is
not
then
if
not
equal
is
unequal
to
the
others
and
in
equality
implies
great
and
small
and
equality
lies
between
great
and
small
and
therefore
the
one
which
is
not
partakes
of
equality
further
the
one
which
is
not
has
being
for
that
which
is
true
is
and
it
is
true
that
the
one
is
not
and
so
the
one
which
is
not
if
remitting
aught
of
the
being
of
would
become
existent
for
not
being
implies
the
being
of
and
being
the
of
or
more
truly
being
partakes
of
the
being
of
being
and
not
of
the
being
of
and
of
the
being
of
and
not
of
the
of
and
therefore
the
one
which
is
not
has
being
and
also
and
the
union
of
being
and
involves
change
or
motion
but
how
can
which
is
nowhere
move
or
change
either
from
one
place
to
another
or
in
the
same
place
and
whether
it
is
or
is
not
it
would
cease
to
be
one
if
experiencing
a
change
of
substance
the
one
which
is
not
then
is
both
in
motion
and
at
rest
is
altered
and
unaltered
and
becomes
and
is
destroyed
and
does
not
become
and
is
not
destroyed
once
more
let
us
ask
the
question
if
one
is
not
what
happens
in
regard
to
one
the
expression
not
implies
negation
of
being
do
we
mean
by
this
to
say
that
a
thing
which
is
not
in
a
certain
sense
is
or
do
we
mean
absolutely
to
deny
being
of
it
the
latter
then
the
one
which
is
not
can
neither
be
nor
become
nor
perish
nor
experience
change
of
substance
or
place
neither
can
rest
or
motion
or
greatness
or
smallness
or
equality
or
unlikeness
or
likeness
either
to
itself
or
other
or
attribute
or
relation
or
now
or
hereafter
or
formerly
or
knowledge
or
opinion
or
perception
or
name
or
anything
else
be
asserted
of
that
which
is
not
once
more
if
one
is
not
what
becomes
of
the
others
if
we
speak
of
them
they
must
be
and
their
very
name
implies
difference
and
difference
implies
relation
not
to
the
one
which
is
not
but
to
one
another
and
they
are
others
of
each
other
not
as
units
but
as
infinities
the
least
of
which
is
also
infinity
and
capable
of
infinitesimal
division
and
they
will
have
no
unity
or
number
but
only
a
semblance
of
unity
and
number
and
the
least
of
them
will
appear
large
and
manifold
in
comparison
with
the
infinitesimal
fractions
into
which
it
may
be
divided
further
each
particle
will
have
the
appearance
of
being
equal
with
the
fractions
for
in
passing
from
the
greater
to
the
less
it
must
reach
an
intermediate
point
which
is
equality
moreover
each
particle
although
having
a
limit
in
relation
to
itself
and
to
other
particles
yet
it
has
neither
beginning
middle
nor
end
for
there
is
always
a
beginning
before
the
beginning
and
a
middle
within
the
middle
and
an
end
beyond
the
end
because
the
infinitesimal
division
is
never
arrested
by
the
one
thus
all
being
is
one
at
a
distance
and
broken
up
when
near
and
like
at
a
distance
and
unlike
when
near
and
also
the
particles
which
compose
being
seem
to
be
like
and
unlike
in
rest
and
motion
in
generation
and
corruption
in
contact
and
separation
if
one
is
not
once
more
let
us
inquire
if
the
one
is
not
and
the
others
of
the
one
are
what
follows
in
the
first
place
the
others
will
not
be
the
one
nor
the
many
for
in
that
case
the
one
would
be
contained
in
them
neither
will
they
appear
to
be
one
or
many
because
they
have
no
communion
or
participation
in
that
which
is
not
nor
semblance
of
that
which
is
not
if
one
is
not
the
others
neither
are
nor
appear
to
be
one
or
many
like
or
unlike
in
contact
or
separation
in
short
if
one
is
not
nothing
is
the
result
of
all
which
is
that
whether
one
is
or
is
not
one
and
the
others
in
relation
to
themselves
and
to
one
another
are
and
are
not
and
appear
to
be
and
appear
not
to
be
in
all
manner
of
ways
i
on
the
first
hypothesis
we
may
remark
first
that
one
is
one
is
an
identical
proposition
from
which
we
might
expect
that
no
further
consequences
could
be
deduced
the
train
of
consequences
which
follows
is
inferred
by
altering
the
predicate
into
many
yet
perhaps
if
a
strict
eristic
had
been
present
oios
aner
ei
kai
nun
paren
he
might
have
affirmed
that
the
not
many
presented
a
different
aspect
of
the
conception
from
the
one
and
was
therefore
not
identical
with
it
such
a
subtlety
would
be
very
much
in
character
with
the
zenonian
dialectic
secondly
we
may
note
that
the
conclusion
is
really
involved
in
the
premises
for
one
is
conceived
as
one
in
a
sense
which
excludes
all
predicates
when
the
meaning
of
one
has
been
reduced
to
a
point
there
is
no
use
in
saying
that
it
has
neither
parts
nor
magnitude
thirdly
the
conception
of
the
same
is
first
of
all
identified
with
the
one
and
then
by
a
further
analysis
distinguished
from
and
even
opposed
to
it
fourthly
we
may
detect
notions
which
have
reappeared
in
modern
philosophy
the
bare
abstraction
of
undefined
unity
answering
to
the
hegelian
or
the
identity
of
contradictions
which
is
older
is
also
younger
or
the
kantian
conception
of
an
a
priori
synthetical
proposition
is
ii
in
the
first
series
of
propositions
the
word
is
really
the
copula
in
the
second
the
verb
of
existence
as
in
the
first
series
the
negative
consequence
followed
from
one
being
affirmed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
not
many
so
here
the
affirmative
consequence
is
deduced
from
one
being
equivalent
to
the
many
in
the
former
case
nothing
could
be
predicated
of
the
one
but
now
everything
multitude
relation
place
time
transition
one
is
regarded
in
all
the
aspects
of
one
and
with
a
reference
to
all
the
consequences
which
flow
either
from
the
combination
or
the
separation
of
them
the
notion
of
transition
involves
the
singular
conception
of
this
idea
of
is
based
upon
the
contradiction
which
is
involved
in
supposing
that
anything
can
be
in
two
places
at
once
it
is
a
mere
fiction
and
we
may
observe
that
similar
antinomies
have
led
modern
philosophers
to
deny
the
reality
of
time
and
space
it
is
not
the
infinitesimal
of
time
but
the
negative
of
time
by
the
help
of
this
invention
the
conception
of
change
which
sorely
exercised
the
minds
of
early
thinkers
seems
to
be
but
is
not
really
at
all
explained
the
difficulty
arises
out
of
the
imperfection
of
language
and
should
therefore
be
no
longer
regarded
as
a
difficulty
at
all
the
only
way
of
meeting
it
if
it
exists
is
to
acknowledge
that
this
rather
puzzling
double
conception
is
necessary
to
the
expression
of
the
phenomena
of
motion
or
change
and
that
this
and
similar
double
notions
instead
of
being
anomalies
are
among
the
higher
and
more
potent
instruments
of
human
thought
the
processes
by
which
parmenides
obtains
his
remarkable
results
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
compound
or
correlative
ideas
which
involve
each
other
such
as
being
and
one
and
many
are
conceived
sometimes
in
a
state
of
composition
and
sometimes
of
division
the
division
or
distinction
is
sometimes
heightened
into
total
opposition
between
one
and
same
one
and
other
or
the
idea
which
has
been
already
divided
is
regarded
like
a
number
as
capable
of
further
infinite
subdivision
the
argument
often
proceeds
dicto
secundum
quid
ad
dictum
simpliciter
and
conversely
the
analogy
of
opposites
is
misused
by
him
he
argues
indiscriminately
sometimes
from
what
is
like
sometimes
from
what
is
unlike
in
them
the
idea
of
being
or
is
identified
with
existence
or
in
place
or
time
the
same
ideas
are
regarded
sometimes
as
in
process
of
transition
sometimes
as
alternatives
or
opposites
there
are
no
degrees
or
kinds
of
sameness
likeness
difference
nor
any
adequate
conception
of
motion
or
change
one
being
time
like
space
in
zeno
puzzle
of
achilles
and
the
tortoise
are
regarded
sometimes
as
continuous
and
sometimes
as
discrete
in
some
parts
of
the
argument
the
abstraction
is
so
rarefied
as
to
become
not
only
fallacious
but
almost
unintelligible
in
the
contradiction
which
is
elicited
out
of
the
relative
terms
older
and
younger
the
relation
between
two
terms
is
regarded
under
contradictory
aspects
as
for
example
when
the
existence
of
the
one
and
the
of
the
one
are
equally
assumed
to
involve
the
existence
of
the
many
words
are
used
through
long
chains
of
argument
sometimes
loosely
sometimes
with
the
precision
of
numbers
or
of
geometrical
figures
the
argument
is
a
very
curious
piece
of
work
unique
in
literature
it
seems
to
be
an
exposition
or
rather
a
ad
absurdum
of
the
megarian
philosophy
but
we
are
too
imperfectly
acquainted
with
this
last
to
speak
with
confidence
about
it
it
would
be
safer
to
say
that
it
is
an
indication
of
the
sceptical
hyperlogical
fancies
which
prevailed
among
the
contemporaries
of
socrates
it
throws
an
indistinct
light
upon
aristotle
and
makes
us
aware
of
the
debt
which
the
world
owes
to
him
or
his
school
it
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
some
modern
speculations
in
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
narrow
language
in
such
a
manner
that
number
and
figure
may
be
made
a
calculus
of
thought
it
exaggerates
one
side
of
logic
and
forgets
the
rest
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
mathematical
process
the
inventor
of
it
delights
as
mathematicians
do
in
eliciting
or
discovering
an
unexpected
result
it
also
helps
to
guard
us
against
some
fallacies
by
showing
the
consequences
which
flow
from
them
in
the
parmenides
we
seem
to
breathe
the
spirit
of
the
megarian
philosophy
though
we
can
not
compare
the
two
in
detail
but
plato
also
goes
beyond
his
megarian
contemporaries
he
has
split
their
straws
over
again
and
admitted
more
than
they
would
have
desired
he
is
indulging
the
analytical
tendencies
of
his
age
which
can
divide
but
not
combine
and
he
does
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
the
distinctions
which
he
makes
are
shadowy
and
fallacious
but
the
argument
blows
he
follows
iii
the
negative
series
of
propositions
contains
the
first
conception
of
the
negation
of
a
negation
two
minus
signs
in
arithmetic
or
algebra
make
a
plus
two
negatives
destroy
each
other
this
abstruse
notion
is
the
foundation
of
the
hegelian
logic
the
mind
must
not
only
admit
that
determination
is
negation
but
must
get
through
negation
into
affirmation
whether
this
process
is
real
or
in
any
way
an
assistance
to
thought
or
like
some
other
logical
forms
a
mere
figure
of
speech
transferred
from
the
sphere
of
mathematics
may
be
doubted
that
plato
and
the
most
subtle
philosopher
of
the
nineteenth
century
should
have
lighted
upon
the
same
notion
is
a
singular
coincidence
of
ancient
and
modern
thought
iv
the
one
and
the
many
or
others
are
reduced
to
their
strictest
arithmetical
meaning
that
one
is
three
or
three
one
is
a
proposition
which
has
perhaps
given
rise
to
more
controversy
in
the
world
than
any
other
but
no
one
has
ever
meant
to
say
that
three
and
one
are
to
be
taken
in
the
same
sense
whereas
the
one
and
many
of
the
parmenides
have
precisely
the
same
meaning
there
is
no
notion
of
one
personality
or
substance
having
many
attributes
or
qualities
the
truth
seems
to
be
rather
the
opposite
of
that
which
socrates
implies
there
is
no
contradiction
in
the
concrete
but
in
the
abstract
and
the
more
abstract
the
idea
the
more
palpable
will
be
the
contradiction
for
just
as
nothing
can
persuade
us
that
the
number
one
is
the
number
three
so
neither
can
we
be
persuaded
that
any
abstract
idea
is
identical
with
its
opposite
although
they
may
both
inhere
together
in
some
external
object
or
some
more
comprehensive
conception
ideas
persons
things
may
be
one
in
one
sense
and
many
in
another
and
may
have
various
degrees
of
unity
and
plurality
but
in
whatever
sense
and
in
whatever
degree
they
are
one
they
cease
to
be
many
and
in
whatever
degree
or
sense
they
are
many
they
cease
to
be
one
two
points
remain
to
be
considered
the
connexion
between
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
dialogue
the
relation
of
the
parmenides
to
the
other
dialogues
i
in
both
divisions
of
the
dialogue
the
principal
speaker
is
the
same
and
the
method
pursued
by
him
is
also
the
same
being
a
criticism
on
received
opinions
first
on
the
doctrine
of
ideas
secondly
of
being
from
the
platonic
ideas
we
naturally
proceed
to
the
eleatic
one
or
being
which
is
the
foundation
of
them
they
are
the
same
philosophy
in
two
forms
and
the
simpler
form
is
the
truer
and
deeper
for
the
platonic
ideas
are
mere
numerical
differences
and
the
moment
we
attempt
to
distinguish
between
them
their
transcendental
character
is
lost
ideas
of
justice
temperance
and
good
are
really
distinguishable
only
with
reference
to
their
application
in
the
world
if
we
once
ask
how
they
are
related
to
individuals
or
to
the
ideas
of
the
divine
mind
they
are
again
merged
in
the
aboriginal
notion
of
being
no
one
can
answer
the
questions
which
parmenides
asks
of
socrates
and
yet
these
questions
are
asked
with
the
express
acknowledgment
that
the
denial
of
ideas
will
be
the
destruction
of
the
human
mind
the
true
answer
to
the
difficulty
here
thrown
out
is
the
establishment
of
a
rational
psychology
and
this
is
a
work
which
is
commenced
in
the
sophist
plato
in
urging
the
difficulty
of
his
own
doctrine
of
ideas
is
far
from
denying
that
some
doctrine
of
ideas
is
necessary
and
for
this
he
is
paving
the
way
in
a
similar
spirit
he
criticizes
the
eleatic
doctrine
of
being
not
intending
to
deny
ontology
but
showing
that
the
old
eleatic
notion
and
the
very
name
is
unable
to
maintain
itself
against
the
subtleties
of
the
megarians
he
did
not
mean
to
say
that
being
or
substance
had
no
existence
but
he
is
preparing
for
the
development
of
his
later
view
that
ideas
were
capable
of
relation
the
fact
that
contradictory
consequences
follow
from
the
existence
or
of
one
or
many
does
not
prove
that
they
have
or
have
not
existence
but
rather
that
some
different
mode
of
conceiving
them
is
required
parmenides
may
still
have
thought
that
was
just
as
kant
would
have
asserted
the
existence
of
in
themselves
while
denying
the
transcendental
use
of
the
categories
several
lesser
links
also
connect
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
dialogue
the
thesis
is
the
same
as
that
which
zeno
has
been
already
discussing
parmenides
has
intimated
in
the
first
part
that
the
method
of
zeno
should
as
socrates
desired
be
extended
to
ideas
the
difficulty
of
participating
in
greatness
smallness
equality
is
urged
against
the
ideas
as
well
as
against
the
one
ii
the
parmenides
is
not
only
a
criticism
of
the
eleatic
notion
of
being
but
also
of
the
methods
of
reasoning
then
in
existence
and
in
this
point
of
view
as
well
as
in
the
other
may
be
regarded
as
an
introduction
to
the
sophist
long
ago
in
the
euthydemus
the
vulgar
application
of
the
and
neither
eristic
had
been
subjected
to
a
similar
criticism
which
there
takes
the
form
of
banter
and
irony
here
of
illustration
the
attack
upon
the
ideas
is
resumed
in
the
philebus
and
is
followed
by
a
return
to
a
more
rational
philosophy
the
perplexity
of
the
one
and
many
is
there
confined
to
the
region
of
ideas
and
replaced
by
a
theory
of
classification
the
good
arranged
in
classes
is
also
contrasted
with
the
barren
abstraction
of
the
megarians
the
war
is
carried
on
against
the
eristics
in
all
the
later
dialogues
sometimes
with
a
playful
irony
at
other
times
with
a
sort
of
contempt
but
there
is
no
lengthened
refutation
of
them
the
parmenides
belongs
to
that
stage
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
in
which
he
is
partially
under
their
influence
using
them
as
a
sort
of
or
diviners
of
the
truth
of
his
own
and
of
the
eleatic
theories
in
the
theaetetus
a
similar
negative
dialectic
is
employed
in
the
attempt
to
define
science
which
after
every
effort
remains
undefined
still
the
same
question
is
revived
from
the
objective
side
in
the
sophist
being
and
are
no
longer
exhibited
in
opposition
but
are
now
reconciled
and
the
true
nature
of
is
discovered
and
made
the
basis
of
the
correlation
of
ideas
some
links
are
probably
missing
which
might
have
been
supplied
if
we
had
trustworthy
accounts
of
plato
oral
teaching
to
sum
up
the
parmenides
of
plato
is
a
critique
first
of
the
platonic
ideas
and
secondly
of
the
eleatic
doctrine
of
being
neither
are
absolutely
denied
but
certain
difficulties
and
consequences
are
shown
in
the
assumption
of
either
which
prove
that
the
platonic
as
well
as
the
eleatic
doctrine
must
be
remodelled
the
negation
and
contradiction
which
are
involved
in
the
conception
of
the
one
and
many
are
preliminary
to
their
final
adjustment
the
platonic
ideas
are
tested
by
the
interrogative
method
of
socrates
the
eleatic
one
or
being
is
tried
by
the
severer
and
perhaps
impossible
method
of
hypothetical
consequences
negative
and
affirmative
in
the
latter
we
have
an
example
of
the
zenonian
or
megarian
dialectic
which
proceeded
not
assailing
premises
but
conclusions
this
is
worked
out
and
improved
by
plato
when
primary
abstractions
are
used
in
every
conceivable
sense
any
or
every
conclusion
may
be
deduced
from
them
the
words
and
their
opposites
have
slightly
different
meanings
as
they
are
applied
to
objects
of
thought
or
objects
of
sense
to
number
time
place
and
to
the
higher
ideas
of
the
reason
and
out
of
their
different
meanings
this
of
contradictions
been
provided
the
parmenides
of
plato
belongs
to
a
stage
of
philosophy
which
has
passed
away
at
first
we
read
it
with
a
purely
antiquarian
or
historical
interest
and
with
difficulty
throw
ourselves
back
into
a
state
of
the
human
mind
in
which
unity
and
being
occupied
the
attention
of
philosophers
we
admire
the
precision
of
the
language
in
which
as
in
some
curious
puzzle
each
word
is
exactly
fitted
into
every
other
and
long
trains
of
argument
are
carried
out
with
a
sort
of
geometrical
accuracy
we
doubt
whether
any
abstract
notion
could
stand
the
searching
of
parmenides
and
may
at
last
perhaps
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
plato
has
been
using
an
imaginary
method
to
work
out
an
unmeaning
conclusion
but
the
truth
is
that
he
is
carrying
on
a
process
which
is
not
either
useless
or
unnecessary
in
any
age
of
philosophy
we
fail
to
understand
him
because
we
do
not
realize
that
the
questions
which
he
is
discussing
could
have
had
any
value
or
importance
we
suppose
them
to
be
like
the
speculations
of
some
of
the
schoolmen
which
end
in
nothing
but
in
truth
he
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
of
thought
which
beset
his
contemporaries
seeing
that
the
megarians
and
cynics
were
making
knowledge
impossible
he
takes
their
and
analyzes
them
from
every
conceivable
point
of
view
he
is
criticizing
the
simplest
and
most
general
of
our
ideas
in
which
as
they
are
the
most
comprehensive
the
danger
of
error
is
the
most
serious
for
if
they
remain
unexamined
as
in
a
mathematical
demonstration
all
that
flows
from
them
is
affected
and
the
error
pervades
knowledge
far
and
wide
in
the
beginning
of
philosophy
this
correction
of
human
ideas
was
even
more
necessary
than
in
our
own
times
because
they
were
more
bound
up
with
words
and
words
when
once
presented
to
the
mind
exercised
a
greater
power
over
thought
there
is
a
natural
realism
which
says
there
be
a
word
devoid
of
meaning
or
an
idea
which
is
an
idea
of
nothing
in
modern
times
mankind
have
often
given
too
great
importance
to
a
word
or
idea
the
philosophy
of
the
ancients
was
still
more
in
slavery
to
them
because
they
had
not
the
experience
of
error
which
would
have
placed
them
above
the
illusion
the
method
of
the
parmenides
may
be
compared
with
the
process
of
purgation
which
bacon
sought
to
introduce
into
philosophy
plato
is
warning
us
against
two
sorts
of
of
the
den
first
his
own
ideas
which
he
himself
having
created
is
unable
to
connect
in
any
way
with
the
external
world
secondly
against
two
idols
in
particular
and
which
had
grown
up
in
the
philosophy
and
were
still
standing
in
the
way
of
all
progress
and
development
of
thought
he
does
not
say
with
bacon
us
make
truth
by
experiment
or
these
vague
and
inexact
notions
let
us
turn
to
facts
the
time
has
not
yet
arrived
for
a
purely
inductive
philosophy
the
instruments
of
thought
must
first
be
forged
that
they
may
be
used
hereafter
by
modern
inquirers
how
while
mankind
were
disputing
about
universals
could
they
classify
phenomena
how
could
they
investigate
causes
when
they
had
not
as
yet
learned
to
distinguish
between
a
cause
and
an
end
how
could
they
make
any
progress
in
the
sciences
without
first
arranging
them
these
are
the
deficiencies
which
plato
is
seeking
to
supply
in
an
age
when
knowledge
was
a
shadow
of
a
name
only
in
the
earlier
dialogues
the
socratic
conception
of
universals
is
illustrated
by
his
genius
in
the
phaedrus
the
nature
of
division
is
explained
in
the
republic
the
law
of
contradiction
and
the
unity
of
knowledge
are
asserted
in
the
later
dialogues
he
is
constantly
engaged
both
with
the
theory
and
practice
of
classification
these
were
the
weapons
as
he
terms
them
in
the
philebus
which
he
was
preparing
for
the
use
of
some
who
in
after
ages
would
be
found
ready
enough
to
disown
their
obligations
to
the
great
master
or
rather
perhaps
would
be
incapable
of
understanding
them
numberless
fallacies
as
we
are
often
truly
told
have
originated
in
a
confusion
of
the
and
the
of
existence
would
not
the
distinction
which
plato
by
the
mouth
of
parmenides
makes
between
is
one
and
has
being
have
saved
us
from
this
and
many
similar
confusions
we
see
again
that
a
long
period
in
the
history
of
philosophy
was
a
barren
tract
not
uncultivated
but
unfruitful
because
there
was
no
inquiry
into
the
relation
of
language
and
thought
and
the
metaphysical
imagination
was
incapable
of
supplying
the
missing
link
between
words
and
things
the
famous
dispute
between
nominalists
and
realists
would
never
have
been
heard
of
if
instead
of
transferring
the
platonic
ideas
into
a
crude
latin
phraseology
the
spirit
of
plato
had
been
truly
understood
and
appreciated
upon
the
term
substance
at
least
two
celebrated
theological
controversies
appear
to
hinge
which
would
not
have
existed
or
at
least
not
in
their
present
form
if
we
had
the
word
substance
as
plato
has
the
notions
of
unity
and
being
these
weeds
of
philosophy
have
struck
their
roots
deep
into
the
soil
and
are
always
tending
to
reappear
sometimes
in
forms
while
similar
words
such
as
development
evolution
law
and
the
like
are
constantly
put
in
the
place
of
facts
even
by
writers
who
profess
to
base
truth
entirely
upon
fact
in
an
unmetaphysical
age
there
is
probably
more
metaphysics
in
the
common
sense
more
a
priori
assumption
than
in
any
other
because
there
is
more
complete
unconsciousness
that
we
are
resting
on
our
own
ideas
while
we
please
ourselves
with
the
conviction
that
we
are
resting
on
facts
we
do
not
consider
how
much
metaphysics
are
required
to
place
us
above
metaphysics
or
how
difficult
it
is
to
prevent
the
forms
of
expression
which
are
ready
made
for
our
use
from
outrunning
actual
observation
and
experiment
in
the
last
century
the
educated
world
were
astonished
to
find
that
the
whole
fabric
of
their
ideas
was
falling
to
pieces
because
hume
amused
himself
by
analyzing
the
word
into
uniform
sequence
then
arose
a
philosophy
which
equally
regardless
of
the
history
of
the
mind
sought
to
save
mankind
from
scepticism
by
assigning
to
our
notions
of
and
effect
and
accident
and
part
a
necessary
place
in
human
thought
without
them
we
could
have
no
experience
and
therefore
they
were
supposed
to
be
prior
to
experience
to
be
incrusted
on
the
although
in
the
phraseology
of
kant
there
could
be
no
transcendental
use
of
them
or
in
other
words
they
were
only
applicable
within
the
range
of
our
knowledge
but
into
the
origin
of
these
ideas
which
he
obtains
partly
by
an
analysis
of
the
proposition
partly
by
development
of
the
he
never
inquires
they
seem
to
him
to
have
a
necessary
existence
nor
does
he
attempt
to
analyse
the
various
senses
in
which
the
word
or
may
be
employed
the
philosophy
of
berkeley
could
never
have
had
any
meaning
even
to
himself
if
he
had
first
analyzed
from
every
point
of
view
the
conception
of
this
poor
forgotten
word
which
was
very
good
word
to
describe
the
simplest
generalization
of
external
objects
is
now
superseded
in
the
vocabulary
of
physical
philosophers
by
which
seems
to
be
accepted
without
any
rigid
examination
of
its
meaning
as
if
the
general
idea
of
in
our
minds
furnished
an
explanation
of
the
infinite
variety
of
forces
which
exist
in
the
universe
a
similar
ambiguity
occurs
in
the
use
of
the
favourite
word
which
is
sometimes
regarded
as
a
mere
abstraction
and
then
elevated
into
a
real
power
or
entity
almost
taking
the
place
of
god
theology
again
is
full
of
undefined
terms
which
have
distracted
the
human
mind
for
ages
mankind
have
reasoned
from
them
but
not
to
them
they
have
drawn
out
the
conclusions
without
proving
the
premises
they
have
asserted
the
premises
without
examining
the
terms
the
passions
of
religious
parties
have
been
roused
to
the
utmost
about
words
of
which
they
could
have
given
no
explanation
and
which
had
really
no
distinct
meaning
one
sort
of
them
faith
grace
justification
have
been
the
symbols
of
one
class
of
disputes
as
the
words
substance
nature
person
of
another
revelation
inspiration
and
the
like
of
a
third
all
of
them
have
been
the
subject
of
endless
reasonings
and
inferences
but
a
spell
has
hung
over
the
minds
of
theologians
or
philosophers
which
has
prevented
them
from
examining
the
words
themselves
either
the
effort
to
rise
above
and
beyond
their
own
first
ideas
was
too
great
for
them
or
there
might
perhaps
have
seemed
to
be
an
irreverence
in
doing
so
about
the
divine
being
himself
in
whom
all
true
theological
ideas
live
and
move
men
have
spoken
and
reasoned
much
and
have
fancied
that
they
instinctively
know
him
but
they
hardly
suspect
that
under
the
name
of
god
even
christians
have
included
two
characters
or
natures
as
much
opposed
as
the
good
and
evil
principle
of
the
persians
to
have
the
true
use
of
words
we
must
compare
them
with
things
in
using
them
we
acknowledge
that
they
seldom
give
a
perfect
representation
of
our
meaning
in
like
manner
when
we
interrogate
our
ideas
we
find
that
we
are
not
using
them
always
in
the
sense
which
we
supposed
and
plato
while
he
criticizes
the
inconsistency
of
his
own
doctrine
of
universals
and
draws
out
the
endless
consequences
which
flow
from
the
assertion
either
that
is
or
that
is
not
by
no
means
intends
to
deny
the
existence
of
universals
or
the
unity
under
which
they
are
comprehended
there
is
nothing
further
from
his
thoughts
than
scepticism
but
before
proceeding
he
must
examine
the
foundations
which
he
and
others
have
been
laying
there
is
nothing
true
which
is
not
from
some
point
of
view
untrue
nothing
absolute
which
is
not
also
relative

republic
and
so
in
modern
times
because
we
are
called
upon
to
analyze
our
ideas
and
to
come
to
a
distinct
understanding
about
the
meaning
of
words
because
we
know
that
the
powers
of
language
are
very
unequal
to
the
subtlety
of
nature
or
of
mind
we
do
not
therefore
renounce
the
use
of
them
but
we
replace
them
in
their
old
connexion
having
first
tested
their
meaning
and
quality
and
having
corrected
the
error
which
is
involved
in
them
or
rather
always
remembering
to
make
allowance
for
the
adulteration
or
alloy
which
they
contain
we
can
not
call
a
new
metaphysical
world
into
existence
any
more
than
we
can
frame
a
new
universal
language
in
thought
as
in
speech
we
are
dependent
on
the
past
we
know
that
the
words
and
are
very
far
from
representing
to
us
the
continuity
or
the
complexity
of
nature
or
the
different
modes
or
degrees
in
which
phenomena
are
connected
yet
we
accept
them
as
the
best
expression
which
we
have
of
the
correlation
of
forces
or
objects
we
see
that
the
term
is
a
mere
abstraction
under
which
laws
of
matter
and
of
mind
the
law
of
nature
and
the
law
of
the
land
are
included
and
some
of
these
uses
of
the
word
are
confusing
because
they
introduce
into
one
sphere
of
thought
associations
which
belong
to
another
for
example
order
or
sequence
is
apt
to
be
confounded
with
external
compulsion
and
the
internal
workings
of
the
mind
with
their
material
antecedents
yet
none
of
them
can
be
dispensed
with
we
can
only
be
on
our
guard
against
the
error
or
confusion
which
arises
out
of
them
thus
in
the
use
of
the
word
we
are
far
from
supposing
that
there
is
any
mysterious
substratum
apart
from
the
objects
which
we
see
and
we
acknowledge
that
the
negative
notion
is
very
likely
to
become
a
positive
one
still
we
retain
the
word
as
a
convenient
generalization
though
not
without
a
double
sense
substance
and
essence
derived
from
the
translation
of
the
greek
ousia
so
the
human
mind
makes
the
reflection
that
god
is
not
a
person
like
ourselves
is
not
a
cause
like
the
material
causes
in
nature
nor
even
an
intelligent
cause
like
a
human
agent
nor
an
individual
for
he
is
universal
and
that
every
possible
conception
which
we
can
form
of
him
is
limited
by
the
human
faculties
we
can
not
by
any
effort
of
thought
or
exertion
of
faith
be
in
and
out
of
our
own
minds
at
the
same
instant
how
can
we
conceive
him
under
the
forms
of
time
and
space
who
is
out
of
time
and
space
how
get
rid
of
such
forms
and
see
him
as
he
is
how
can
we
imagine
his
relation
to
the
world
or
to
ourselves
innumerable
contradictions
follow
from
either
of
the
two
alternatives
that
god
is
or
that
he
is
not
yet
we
are
far
from
saying
that
we
know
nothing
of
him
because
all
that
we
know
is
subject
to
the
conditions
of
human
thought
to
the
old
belief
in
him
we
return
but
with
corrections
he
is
a
person
but
not
like
ourselves
a
mind
but
not
a
human
mind
a
cause
but
not
a
material
cause
nor
yet
a
maker
or
artificer
the
words
which
we
use
are
imperfect
expressions
of
his
true
nature
but
we
do
not
therefore
lose
faith
in
what
is
best
and
highest
in
ourselves
and
in
the
world
little
philosophy
takes
us
away
from
god
a
great
deal
brings
us
back
to
him
when
we
begin
to
reflect
our
first
thoughts
respecting
him
and
ourselves
are
apt
to
be
sceptical
for
we
can
analyze
our
religious
as
well
as
our
other
ideas
we
can
trace
their
history
we
can
criticize
their
perversion
we
see
that
they
are
relative
to
the
human
mind
and
to
one
another
but
when
we
have
carried
our
criticism
to
the
furthest
point
they
still
remain
a
necessity
of
our
moral
nature
better
known
and
understood
by
us
and
less
liable
to
be
shaken
because
we
are
more
aware
of
their
necessary
imperfection
they
come
to
us
with
opinion
better
confirmation
not
merely
as
the
inspirations
either
of
ourselves
or
of
another
but
deeply
rooted
in
history
and
in
the
human
mind
parmenides
persons
of
the
dialogue
cephalus
adeimantus
glaucon
antiphon
pythodorus
socrates
zeno
parmenides
aristoteles
cephalus
rehearses
a
dialogue
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
narrated
in
his
presence
by
antiphon
the
of
adeimantus
and
glaucon
to
certain
clazomenians
we
had
come
from
our
home
at
clazomenae
to
athens
and
met
adeimantus
and
glaucon
in
the
agora
welcome
cephalus
said
adeimantus
taking
me
by
the
hand
is
there
anything
which
we
can
do
for
you
in
athens
yes
that
is
why
i
am
here
i
wish
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
what
may
that
be
he
said
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
name
of
your
half
brother
which
i
have
forgotten
he
was
a
mere
child
when
i
last
came
hither
from
clazomenae
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
his
father
name
if
i
remember
rightly
was
pyrilampes
yes
he
said
and
the
name
of
our
brother
antiphon
but
why
do
you
ask
let
me
introduce
some
countrymen
of
mine
i
said
they
are
lovers
of
philosophy
and
have
heard
that
antiphon
was
intimate
with
a
certain
pythodorus
a
friend
of
zeno
and
remembers
a
conversation
which
took
place
between
socrates
zeno
and
parmenides
many
years
ago
pythodorus
having
often
recited
it
to
him
quite
true
and
could
we
hear
it
i
asked
nothing
easier
he
replied
when
he
was
a
youth
he
made
a
careful
study
of
the
piece
at
present
his
thoughts
run
in
another
direction
like
his
grandfather
antiphon
he
is
devoted
to
horses
but
if
that
is
what
you
want
let
us
go
and
look
for
him
he
dwells
at
melita
which
is
quite
near
and
he
has
only
just
left
us
to
go
home
accordingly
we
went
to
look
for
him
he
was
at
home
and
in
the
act
of
giving
a
bridle
to
a
smith
to
be
fitted
when
he
had
done
with
the
smith
his
brothers
told
him
the
purpose
of
our
visit
and
he
saluted
me
as
an
acquaintance
whom
he
remembered
from
my
former
visit
and
we
asked
him
to
repeat
the
dialogue
at
first
he
was
not
very
willing
and
complained
of
the
trouble
but
at
length
he
consented
he
told
us
that
pythodorus
had
described
to
him
the
appearance
of
parmenides
and
zeno
they
came
to
athens
as
he
said
at
the
great
panathenaea
the
former
was
at
the
time
of
his
visit
about
years
old
very
white
with
age
but
well
favoured
zeno
was
nearly
years
of
age
tall
and
fair
to
look
upon
in
the
days
of
his
youth
he
was
reported
to
have
been
beloved
by
parmenides
he
said
that
they
lodged
with
pythodorus
in
the
ceramicus
outside
the
wall
whither
socrates
then
a
very
young
man
came
to
see
them
and
many
others
with
him
they
wanted
to
hear
the
writings
of
zeno
which
had
been
brought
to
athens
for
the
first
time
on
the
occasion
of
their
visit
these
zeno
himself
read
to
them
in
the
absence
of
parmenides
and
had
very
nearly
finished
when
pythodorus
entered
and
with
him
parmenides
and
aristoteles
who
was
afterwards
one
of
the
thirty
and
heard
the
little
that
remained
of
the
dialogue
pythodorus
had
heard
zeno
repeat
them
before
when
the
recitation
was
completed
socrates
requested
that
the
first
thesis
of
the
first
argument
might
be
read
over
again
and
this
having
been
done
he
said
what
is
your
meaning
zeno
do
you
maintain
that
if
being
is
many
it
must
be
both
like
and
unlike
and
that
this
is
impossible
for
neither
can
the
like
be
unlike
nor
the
unlike
like
is
that
your
position
just
so
said
zeno
and
if
the
unlike
can
not
be
like
or
the
like
unlike
then
according
to
you
being
could
not
be
many
for
this
would
involve
an
impossibility
in
all
that
you
say
have
you
any
other
purpose
except
to
disprove
the
being
of
the
many
and
is
not
each
division
of
your
treatise
intended
to
furnish
a
separate
proof
of
this
there
being
in
all
as
many
proofs
of
the
of
the
many
as
you
have
composed
arguments
is
that
your
meaning
or
have
i
misunderstood
you
no
said
zeno
you
have
correctly
understood
my
general
purpose
i
see
parmenides
said
socrates
that
zeno
would
like
to
be
not
only
one
with
you
in
friendship
but
your
second
self
in
his
writings
too
he
puts
what
you
say
in
another
way
and
would
fain
make
believe
that
he
is
telling
us
something
which
is
new
for
you
in
your
poems
say
the
all
is
one
and
of
this
you
adduce
excellent
proofs
and
he
on
the
other
hand
says
there
is
no
many
and
on
behalf
of
this
he
offers
overwhelming
evidence
you
affirm
unity
he
denies
plurality
and
so
you
deceive
the
world
into
believing
that
you
are
saying
different
things
when
really
you
are
saying
much
the
same
this
is
a
strain
of
art
beyond
the
reach
of
most
of
us
yes
socrates
said
zeno
but
although
you
are
as
keen
as
a
spartan
hound
in
pursuing
the
track
you
do
not
fully
apprehend
the
true
motive
of
the
composition
which
is
not
really
such
an
artificial
work
as
you
imagine
for
what
you
speak
of
was
an
accident
there
was
no
pretence
of
a
great
purpose
nor
any
serious
intention
of
deceiving
the
world
the
truth
is
that
these
writings
of
mine
were
meant
to
protect
the
arguments
of
parmenides
against
those
who
make
fun
of
him
and
seek
to
show
the
many
ridiculous
and
contradictory
results
which
they
suppose
to
follow
from
the
affirmation
of
the
one
my
answer
is
addressed
to
the
partisans
of
the
many
whose
attack
i
return
with
interest
by
retorting
upon
them
that
their
hypothesis
of
the
being
of
many
if
carried
out
appears
to
be
still
more
ridiculous
than
the
hypothesis
of
the
being
of
one
zeal
for
my
master
led
me
to
write
the
book
in
the
days
of
my
youth
but
some
one
stole
the
copy
and
therefore
i
had
no
choice
whether
it
should
be
published
or
not
the
motive
however
of
writing
was
not
the
ambition
of
an
elder
man
but
the
pugnacity
of
a
young
one
this
you
do
not
seem
to
see
socrates
though
in
other
respects
as
i
was
saying
your
notion
is
a
very
just
one
i
understand
said
socrates
and
quite
accept
your
account
but
tell
me
zeno
do
you
not
further
think
that
there
is
an
idea
of
likeness
in
itself
and
another
idea
of
unlikeness
which
is
the
opposite
of
likeness
and
that
in
these
two
you
and
i
and
all
other
things
to
which
we
apply
the
term
many
participate
things
which
participate
in
likeness
become
in
that
degree
and
manner
like
and
so
far
as
they
participate
in
unlikeness
become
in
that
degree
unlike
or
both
like
and
unlike
in
the
degree
in
which
they
participate
in
both
and
may
not
all
things
partake
of
both
opposites
and
be
both
like
and
unlike
by
reason
of
this
participation
where
is
the
wonder
now
if
a
person
could
prove
the
absolute
like
to
become
unlike
or
the
absolute
unlike
to
become
like
that
in
my
opinion
would
indeed
be
a
wonder
but
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
zeno
in
showing
that
the
things
which
only
partake
of
likeness
and
unlikeness
experience
both
nor
again
if
a
person
were
to
show
that
all
is
one
by
partaking
of
one
and
at
the
same
time
many
by
partaking
of
many
would
that
be
very
astonishing
but
if
he
were
to
show
me
that
the
absolute
one
was
many
or
the
absolute
many
one
i
should
be
truly
amazed
and
so
of
all
the
rest
i
should
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
natures
or
ideas
themselves
had
these
opposite
qualities
but
not
if
a
person
wanted
to
prove
of
me
that
i
was
many
and
also
one
when
he
wanted
to
show
that
i
was
many
he
would
say
that
i
have
a
right
and
a
left
side
and
a
front
and
a
back
and
an
upper
and
a
lower
half
for
i
can
not
deny
that
i
partake
of
multitude
when
on
the
other
hand
he
wants
to
prove
that
i
am
one
he
will
say
that
we
who
are
here
assembled
are
seven
and
that
i
am
one
and
partake
of
the
one
in
both
instances
he
proves
his
case
so
again
if
a
person
shows
that
such
things
as
wood
stones
and
the
like
being
many
are
also
one
we
admit
that
he
shows
the
coexistence
of
the
one
and
many
but
he
does
not
show
that
the
many
are
one
or
the
one
many
he
is
uttering
not
a
paradox
but
a
truism
if
however
as
i
just
now
suggested
some
one
were
to
abstract
simple
notions
of
like
unlike
one
many
rest
motion
and
similar
ideas
and
then
to
show
that
these
admit
of
admixture
and
separation
in
themselves
i
should
be
very
much
astonished
this
part
of
the
argument
appears
to
be
treated
by
you
zeno
in
a
very
spirited
manner
but
as
i
was
saying
i
should
be
far
more
amazed
if
any
one
found
in
the
ideas
themselves
which
are
apprehended
by
reason
the
same
puzzle
and
entanglement
which
you
have
shown
to
exist
in
visible
objects
while
socrates
was
speaking
pythodorus
thought
that
parmenides
and
zeno
were
not
altogether
pleased
at
the
successive
steps
of
the
argument
but
still
they
gave
the
closest
attention
and
often
looked
at
one
another
and
smiled
as
if
in
admiration
of
him
when
he
had
finished
parmenides
expressed
their
feelings
in
the
following
words
socrates
he
said
i
admire
the
bent
of
your
mind
towards
philosophy
tell
me
now
was
this
your
own
distinction
between
ideas
in
themselves
and
the
things
which
partake
of
them
and
do
you
think
that
there
is
an
idea
of
likeness
apart
from
the
likeness
which
we
possess
and
of
the
one
and
many
and
of
the
other
things
which
zeno
mentioned
i
think
that
there
are
such
ideas
said
socrates
parmenides
proceeded
and
would
you
also
make
absolute
ideas
of
the
just
and
the
beautiful
and
the
good
and
of
all
that
class
yes
he
said
i
should
and
would
you
make
an
idea
of
man
apart
from
us
and
from
all
other
human
creatures
or
of
fire
and
water
i
am
often
undecided
parmenides
as
to
whether
i
ought
to
include
them
or
not
and
would
you
feel
equally
undecided
socrates
about
things
of
which
the
mention
may
provoke
a
smile
i
mean
such
things
as
hair
mud
dirt
or
anything
else
which
is
vile
and
paltry
would
you
suppose
that
each
of
these
has
an
idea
distinct
from
the
actual
objects
with
which
we
come
into
contact
or
not
certainly
not
said
socrates
visible
things
like
these
are
such
as
they
appear
to
us
and
i
am
afraid
that
there
would
be
an
absurdity
in
assuming
any
idea
of
them
although
i
sometimes
get
disturbed
and
begin
to
think
that
there
is
nothing
without
an
idea
but
then
again
when
i
have
taken
up
this
position
i
run
away
because
i
am
afraid
that
i
may
fall
into
a
bottomless
pit
of
nonsense
and
perish
and
so
i
return
to
the
ideas
of
which
i
was
just
now
speaking
and
occupy
myself
with
them
yes
socrates
said
parmenides
that
is
because
you
are
still
young
the
time
will
come
if
i
am
not
mistaken
when
philosophy
will
have
a
firmer
grasp
of
you
and
then
you
will
not
despise
even
the
meanest
things
at
your
age
you
are
too
much
disposed
to
regard
the
opinions
of
men
but
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
mean
that
there
are
certain
ideas
of
which
all
other
things
partake
and
from
which
they
derive
their
names
that
similars
for
example
become
similar
because
they
partake
of
similarity
and
great
things
become
great
because
they
partake
of
greatness
and
that
just
and
beautiful
things
become
just
and
beautiful
because
they
partake
of
justice
and
beauty
yes
certainly
said
socrates
that
is
my
meaning
then
each
individual
partakes
either
of
the
whole
of
the
idea
or
else
of
a
part
of
the
idea
can
there
be
any
other
mode
of
participation
there
can
not
be
he
said
then
do
you
think
that
the
whole
idea
is
one
and
yet
being
one
is
in
each
one
of
the
many
why
not
parmenides
said
socrates
because
one
and
the
same
thing
will
exist
as
a
whole
at
the
same
time
in
many
separate
individuals
and
will
therefore
be
in
a
state
of
separation
from
itself
nay
but
the
idea
may
be
like
the
day
which
is
one
and
the
same
in
many
places
at
once
and
yet
continuous
with
itself
in
this
way
each
idea
may
be
one
and
the
same
in
all
at
the
same
time
i
like
your
way
socrates
of
making
one
in
many
places
at
once
you
mean
to
say
that
if
i
were
to
spread
out
a
sail
and
cover
a
number
of
men
there
would
be
one
whole
including
many
is
not
that
your
meaning
i
think
so
and
would
you
say
that
the
whole
sail
includes
each
man
or
a
part
of
it
only
and
different
parts
different
men
the
latter
then
socrates
the
ideas
themselves
will
be
divisible
and
things
which
participate
in
them
will
have
a
part
of
them
only
and
not
the
whole
idea
existing
in
each
of
them
that
seems
to
follow
then
would
you
like
to
say
socrates
that
the
one
idea
is
really
divisible
and
yet
remains
one
certainly
not
he
said
suppose
that
you
divide
absolute
greatness
and
that
of
the
many
great
things
each
one
is
great
in
virtue
of
a
portion
of
greatness
less
than
absolute
greatness
is
that
conceivable
no
or
will
each
equal
thing
if
possessing
some
small
portion
of
equality
less
than
absolute
equality
be
equal
to
some
other
thing
by
virtue
of
that
portion
only
impossible
or
suppose
one
of
us
to
have
a
portion
of
smallness
this
is
but
a
part
of
the
small
and
therefore
the
absolutely
small
is
greater
if
the
absolutely
small
be
greater
that
to
which
the
part
of
the
small
is
added
will
be
smaller
and
not
greater
than
before
how
absurd
then
in
what
way
socrates
will
all
things
participate
in
the
ideas
if
they
are
unable
to
participate
in
them
either
as
parts
or
wholes
indeed
he
said
you
have
asked
a
question
which
is
not
easily
answered
well
said
parmenides
and
what
do
you
say
of
another
question
what
question
i
imagine
that
the
way
in
which
you
are
led
to
assume
one
idea
of
each
kind
is
as
follows
you
see
a
number
of
great
objects
and
when
you
look
at
them
there
seems
to
you
to
be
one
and
the
same
idea
or
nature
in
them
all
hence
you
conceive
of
greatness
as
one
very
true
said
socrates
and
if
you
go
on
and
allow
your
mind
in
like
manner
to
embrace
in
one
view
the
idea
of
greatness
and
of
great
things
which
are
not
the
idea
and
to
compare
them
will
not
another
greatness
arise
which
will
appear
to
be
the
source
of
all
these
it
would
seem
so
then
another
idea
of
greatness
now
comes
into
view
over
and
above
absolute
greatness
and
the
individuals
which
partake
of
it
and
then
another
over
and
above
all
these
by
virtue
of
which
they
will
all
be
great
and
so
each
idea
instead
of
being
one
will
be
infinitely
multiplied
but
may
not
the
ideas
asked
socrates
be
thoughts
only
and
have
no
proper
existence
except
in
our
minds
parmenides
for
in
that
case
each
idea
may
still
be
one
and
not
experience
this
infinite
multiplication
and
can
there
be
individual
thoughts
which
are
thoughts
of
nothing
impossible
he
said
the
thought
must
be
of
something
yes
of
something
which
is
or
which
is
not
of
something
which
is
must
it
not
be
of
a
single
something
which
the
thought
recognizes
as
attaching
to
all
being
a
single
form
or
nature
yes
and
will
not
the
something
which
is
apprehended
as
one
and
the
same
in
all
be
an
idea
from
that
again
there
is
no
escape
then
said
parmenides
if
you
say
that
everything
else
participates
in
the
ideas
must
you
not
say
either
that
everything
is
made
up
of
thoughts
and
that
all
things
think
or
that
they
are
thoughts
but
have
no
thought
the
latter
view
parmenides
is
no
more
rational
than
the
previous
one
in
my
opinion
the
ideas
are
as
it
were
patterns
fixed
in
nature
and
other
things
are
like
them
and
resemblances
of
them
what
is
meant
by
the
participation
of
other
things
in
the
ideas
is
really
assimilation
to
them
but
if
said
he
the
individual
is
like
the
idea
must
not
the
idea
also
be
like
the
individual
in
so
far
as
the
individual
is
a
resemblance
of
the
idea
that
which
is
like
can
not
be
conceived
of
as
other
than
the
like
of
like
impossible
and
when
two
things
are
alike
must
they
not
partake
of
the
same
idea
they
must
and
will
not
that
of
which
the
two
partake
and
which
makes
them
alike
be
the
idea
itself
certainly
then
the
idea
can
not
be
like
the
individual
or
the
individual
like
the
idea
for
if
they
are
alike
some
further
idea
of
likeness
will
always
be
coming
to
light
and
if
that
be
like
anything
else
another
and
new
ideas
will
be
always
arising
if
the
idea
resembles
that
which
partakes
of
it
quite
true
the
theory
then
that
other
things
participate
in
the
ideas
by
resemblance
has
to
be
given
up
and
some
other
mode
of
participation
devised
it
would
seem
so
do
you
see
then
socrates
how
great
is
the
difficulty
of
affirming
the
ideas
to
be
absolute
yes
indeed
and
further
let
me
say
that
as
yet
you
only
understand
a
small
part
of
the
difficulty
which
is
involved
if
you
make
of
each
thing
a
single
idea
parting
it
off
from
other
things
what
difficulty
he
said
there
are
many
but
the
greatest
of
all
is
this
if
an
opponent
argues
that
these
ideas
being
such
as
we
say
they
ought
to
be
must
remain
unknown
no
one
can
prove
to
him
that
he
is
wrong
unless
he
who
denies
their
existence
be
a
man
of
great
ability
and
knowledge
and
is
willing
to
follow
a
long
and
laborious
demonstration
he
will
remain
unconvinced
and
still
insist
that
they
can
not
be
known
what
do
you
mean
parmenides
said
socrates
in
the
first
place
i
think
socrates
that
you
or
any
one
who
maintains
the
existence
of
absolute
essences
will
admit
that
they
can
not
exist
in
us
no
said
socrates
for
then
they
would
be
no
longer
absolute
true
he
said
and
therefore
when
ideas
are
what
they
are
in
relation
to
one
another
their
essence
is
determined
by
a
relation
among
themselves
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
resemblances
or
whatever
they
are
to
be
termed
which
are
in
our
sphere
and
from
which
we
receive
this
or
that
name
when
we
partake
of
them
and
the
things
which
are
within
our
sphere
and
have
the
same
names
with
them
are
likewise
only
relative
to
one
another
and
not
to
the
ideas
which
have
the
same
names
with
them
but
belong
to
themselves
and
not
to
them
what
do
you
mean
said
socrates
i
may
illustrate
my
meaning
in
this
way
said
parmenides
a
master
has
a
slave
now
there
is
nothing
absolute
in
the
relation
between
them
which
is
simply
a
relation
of
one
man
to
another
but
there
is
also
an
idea
of
mastership
in
the
abstract
which
is
relative
to
the
idea
of
slavery
in
the
abstract
these
natures
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
nor
we
with
them
they
are
concerned
with
themselves
only
and
we
with
ourselves
do
you
see
my
meaning
yes
said
socrates
i
quite
see
your
meaning
and
will
not
knowledge
i
mean
absolute
knowledge
answer
to
absolute
truth
certainly
and
each
kind
of
absolute
knowledge
will
answer
to
each
kind
of
absolute
being
yes
but
the
knowledge
which
we
have
will
answer
to
the
truth
which
we
have
and
again
each
kind
of
knowledge
which
we
have
will
be
a
knowledge
of
each
kind
of
being
which
we
have
certainly
but
the
ideas
themselves
as
you
admit
we
have
not
and
can
not
have
no
we
can
not
and
the
absolute
natures
or
kinds
are
known
severally
by
the
absolute
idea
of
knowledge
yes
and
we
have
not
got
the
idea
of
knowledge
no
then
none
of
the
ideas
are
known
to
us
because
we
have
no
share
in
absolute
knowledge
i
suppose
not
then
the
nature
of
the
beautiful
in
itself
and
of
the
good
in
itself
and
all
other
ideas
which
we
suppose
to
exist
absolutely
are
unknown
to
us
it
would
seem
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
stranger
consequence
still
what
is
it
would
you
or
would
you
not
say
that
absolute
knowledge
if
there
is
such
a
thing
must
be
a
far
more
exact
knowledge
than
our
knowledge
and
the
same
of
beauty
and
of
the
rest
yes
and
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
participation
in
absolute
knowledge
no
one
is
more
likely
than
god
to
have
this
most
exact
knowledge
certainly
but
then
will
god
having
absolute
knowledge
have
a
knowledge
of
human
things
why
not
because
socrates
said
parmenides
we
have
admitted
that
the
ideas
are
not
valid
in
relation
to
human
things
nor
human
things
in
relation
to
them
the
relations
of
either
are
limited
to
their
respective
spheres
yes
that
has
been
admitted
and
if
god
has
this
perfect
authority
and
perfect
knowledge
his
authority
can
not
rule
us
nor
his
knowledge
know
us
or
any
human
thing
just
as
our
authority
does
not
extend
to
the
gods
nor
our
knowledge
know
anything
which
is
divine
so
by
parity
of
reason
they
being
gods
are
not
our
masters
neither
do
they
know
the
things
of
men
yet
surely
said
socrates
to
deprive
god
of
knowledge
is
monstrous
these
socrates
said
parmenides
are
a
few
and
only
a
few
of
the
difficulties
in
which
we
are
involved
if
ideas
really
are
and
we
determine
each
one
of
them
to
be
an
absolute
unity
he
who
hears
what
may
be
said
against
them
will
deny
the
very
existence
of
them
and
even
if
they
do
exist
he
will
say
that
they
must
of
necessity
be
unknown
to
man
and
he
will
seem
to
have
reason
on
his
side
and
as
we
were
remarking
just
now
will
be
very
difficult
to
convince
a
man
must
be
gifted
with
very
considerable
ability
before
he
can
learn
that
everything
has
a
class
and
an
absolute
essence
and
still
more
remarkable
will
he
be
who
discovers
all
these
things
for
himself
and
having
thoroughly
investigated
them
is
able
to
teach
them
to
others
i
agree
with
you
parmenides
said
socrates
and
what
you
say
is
very
much
to
my
mind
and
yet
socrates
said
parmenides
if
a
man
fixing
his
attention
on
these
and
the
like
difficulties
does
away
with
ideas
of
things
and
will
not
admit
that
every
individual
thing
has
its
own
determinate
idea
which
is
always
one
and
the
same
he
will
have
nothing
on
which
his
mind
can
rest
and
so
he
will
utterly
destroy
the
power
of
reasoning
as
you
seem
to
me
to
have
particularly
noted
very
true
he
said
but
then
what
is
to
become
of
philosophy
whither
shall
we
turn
if
the
ideas
are
unknown
i
certainly
do
not
see
my
way
at
present
yes
said
parmenides
and
i
think
that
this
arises
socrates
out
of
your
attempting
to
define
the
beautiful
the
just
the
good
and
the
ideas
generally
without
sufficient
previous
training
i
noticed
your
deficiency
when
i
heard
you
talking
here
with
your
friend
aristoteles
the
day
before
yesterday
the
impulse
that
carries
you
towards
philosophy
is
assuredly
noble
and
divine
but
there
is
an
art
which
is
called
by
the
vulgar
idle
talking
and
which
is
often
imagined
to
be
useless
in
that
you
must
train
and
exercise
yourself
now
that
you
are
young
or
truth
will
elude
your
grasp
and
what
is
the
nature
of
this
exercise
parmenides
which
you
would
recommend
that
which
you
heard
zeno
practising
at
the
same
time
i
give
you
credit
for
saying
to
him
that
you
did
not
care
to
examine
the
perplexity
in
reference
to
visible
things
or
to
consider
the
question
that
way
but
only
in
reference
to
objects
of
thought
and
to
what
may
be
called
ideas
why
yes
he
said
there
appears
to
me
to
be
no
difficulty
in
showing
by
this
method
that
visible
things
are
like
and
unlike
and
may
experience
anything
quite
true
said
parmenides
but
i
think
that
you
should
go
a
step
further
and
consider
not
only
the
consequences
which
flow
from
a
given
hypothesis
but
also
the
consequences
which
flow
from
denying
the
hypothesis
and
that
will
be
still
better
training
for
you
what
do
you
mean
he
said
i
mean
for
example
that
in
the
case
of
this
very
hypothesis
of
zeno
about
the
many
you
should
inquire
not
only
what
will
be
the
consequences
to
the
many
in
relation
to
themselves
and
to
the
one
and
to
the
one
in
relation
to
itself
and
the
many
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
being
of
the
many
but
also
what
will
be
the
consequences
to
the
one
and
the
many
in
their
relation
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
on
the
opposite
hypothesis
or
again
if
likeness
is
or
is
not
what
will
be
the
consequences
in
either
of
these
cases
to
the
subjects
of
the
hypothesis
and
to
other
things
in
relation
both
to
themselves
and
to
one
another
and
so
of
unlikeness
and
the
same
holds
good
of
motion
and
rest
of
generation
and
destruction
and
even
of
being
and
in
a
word
when
you
suppose
anything
to
be
or
not
to
be
or
to
be
in
any
way
affected
you
must
look
at
the
consequences
in
relation
to
the
thing
itself
and
to
any
other
things
which
you
choose
to
each
of
them
singly
to
more
than
one
and
to
all
and
so
of
other
things
you
must
look
at
them
in
relation
to
themselves
and
to
anything
else
which
you
suppose
either
to
be
or
not
to
be
if
you
would
train
yourself
perfectly
and
see
the
real
truth
that
parmenides
is
a
tremendous
business
of
which
you
speak
and
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
will
you
take
some
hypothesis
and
go
through
the
steps
then
i
shall
apprehend
you
better
that
socrates
is
a
serious
task
to
impose
on
a
man
of
my
years
then
will
you
zeno
said
socrates
zeno
answered
with
a
smile
let
us
make
our
petition
to
parmenides
himself
who
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
you
are
hardly
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
task
which
you
are
imposing
on
him
and
if
there
were
more
of
us
i
should
not
ask
him
for
these
are
not
subjects
which
any
one
especially
at
his
age
can
well
speak
of
before
a
large
audience
most
people
are
not
aware
that
this
roundabout
progress
through
all
things
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
mind
can
attain
truth
and
wisdom
and
therefore
parmenides
i
join
in
the
request
of
socrates
that
i
may
hear
the
process
again
which
i
have
not
heard
for
a
long
time
when
zeno
had
thus
spoken
pythodorus
according
to
antiphon
report
of
him
said
that
he
himself
and
aristoteles
and
the
whole
company
entreated
parmenides
to
give
an
example
of
the
process
i
can
not
refuse
said
parmenides
and
yet
i
feel
rather
like
ibycus
who
when
in
his
old
age
against
his
will
he
fell
in
love
compared
himself
to
an
old
racehorse
who
was
about
to
run
in
a
chariot
race
shaking
with
fear
at
the
course
he
knew
so
well
this
was
his
simile
of
himself
and
i
also
experience
a
trembling
when
i
remember
through
what
an
ocean
of
words
i
have
to
wade
at
my
time
of
life
but
i
must
indulge
you
as
zeno
says
that
i
ought
and
we
are
alone
where
shall
i
begin
and
what
shall
be
our
first
hypothesis
if
i
am
to
attempt
this
laborious
pastime
shall
i
begin
with
myself
and
take
my
own
hypothesis
the
one
and
consider
the
consequences
which
follow
on
the
supposition
either
of
the
being
or
of
the
of
one
by
all
means
said
zeno
and
who
will
answer
me
he
said
shall
i
propose
the
youngest
he
will
not
make
difficulties
and
will
be
the
most
likely
to
say
what
he
thinks
and
his
answers
will
give
me
time
to
breathe
i
am
the
one
whom
you
mean
parmenides
said
aristoteles
for
i
am
the
youngest
and
at
your
service
ask
and
i
will
answer
parmenides
proceeded
if
one
is
he
said
the
one
can
not
be
many
impossible
then
the
one
can
not
have
parts
and
can
not
be
a
whole
why
not
because
every
part
is
part
of
a
whole
is
it
not
yes
and
what
is
a
whole
would
not
that
of
which
no
part
is
wanting
be
a
whole
certainly
then
in
either
case
the
one
would
be
made
up
of
parts
both
as
being
a
whole
and
also
as
having
parts
to
be
sure
and
in
either
case
the
one
would
be
many
and
not
one
true
but
surely
it
ought
to
be
one
and
not
many
it
ought
then
if
the
one
is
to
remain
one
it
will
not
be
a
whole
and
will
not
have
parts
no
but
if
it
has
no
parts
it
will
have
neither
beginning
middle
nor
end
for
these
would
of
course
be
parts
of
it
right
but
then
again
a
beginning
and
an
end
are
the
limits
of
everything
certainly
then
the
one
having
neither
beginning
nor
end
is
unlimited
yes
unlimited
and
therefore
formless
for
it
can
not
partake
either
of
round
or
straight
but
why
why
because
the
round
is
that
of
which
all
the
extreme
points
are
equidistant
from
the
centre
yes
and
the
straight
is
that
of
which
the
centre
intercepts
the
view
of
the
extremes
true
then
the
one
would
have
parts
and
would
be
many
if
it
partook
either
of
a
straight
or
of
a
circular
form
assuredly
but
having
no
parts
it
will
be
neither
straight
nor
round
right
and
being
of
such
a
nature
it
can
not
be
in
any
place
for
it
can
not
be
either
in
another
or
in
itself
how
so
because
if
it
were
in
another
it
would
be
encircled
by
that
in
which
it
was
and
would
touch
it
at
many
places
and
with
many
parts
but
that
which
is
one
and
indivisible
and
does
not
partake
of
a
circular
nature
can
not
be
touched
all
round
in
many
places
certainly
not
but
if
on
the
other
hand
one
were
in
itself
it
would
also
be
contained
by
nothing
else
but
itself
that
is
to
say
if
it
were
really
in
itself
for
nothing
can
be
in
anything
which
does
not
contain
it
impossible
but
then
that
which
contains
must
be
other
than
that
which
is
contained
for
the
same
whole
can
not
do
and
suffer
both
at
once
and
if
so
one
will
be
no
longer
one
but
two
true
then
one
can
not
be
anywhere
either
in
itself
or
in
another
no
further
consider
whether
that
which
is
of
such
a
nature
can
have
either
rest
or
motion
why
not
why
because
the
one
if
it
were
moved
would
be
either
moved
in
place
or
changed
in
nature
for
these
are
the
only
kinds
of
motion
yes
and
the
one
when
it
changes
and
ceases
to
be
itself
can
not
be
any
longer
one
it
can
not
it
can
not
therefore
experience
the
sort
of
motion
which
is
change
of
nature
clearly
not
then
can
the
motion
of
the
one
be
in
place
perhaps
but
if
the
one
moved
in
place
must
it
not
either
move
round
and
round
in
the
same
place
or
from
one
place
to
another
it
must
and
that
which
moves
in
a
circle
must
rest
upon
a
centre
and
that
which
goes
round
upon
a
centre
must
have
parts
which
are
different
from
the
centre
but
that
which
has
no
centre
and
no
parts
can
not
possibly
be
carried
round
upon
a
centre
impossible
but
perhaps
the
motion
of
the
one
consists
in
change
of
place
perhaps
so
if
it
moves
at
all
and
have
we
not
already
shown
that
it
can
not
be
in
anything
yes
then
its
coming
into
being
in
anything
is
still
more
impossible
is
it
not
i
do
not
see
why
why
because
anything
which
comes
into
being
in
anything
can
neither
as
yet
be
in
that
other
thing
while
still
coming
into
being
nor
be
altogether
out
of
it
if
already
coming
into
being
in
it
certainly
not
and
therefore
whatever
comes
into
being
in
another
must
have
parts
and
then
one
part
may
be
in
and
another
part
out
of
that
other
but
that
which
has
no
parts
can
never
be
at
one
and
the
same
time
neither
wholly
within
nor
wholly
without
anything
true
and
is
there
not
a
still
greater
impossibility
in
that
which
has
no
parts
and
is
not
a
whole
coming
into
being
anywhere
since
it
can
not
come
into
being
either
as
a
part
or
as
a
whole
clearly
then
it
does
not
change
place
by
revolving
in
the
same
spot
nor
by
going
somewhere
and
coming
into
being
in
something
nor
again
by
change
in
itself
very
true
then
in
respect
of
any
kind
of
motion
the
one
is
immoveable
immoveable
but
neither
can
the
one
be
in
anything
as
we
affirm
yes
we
said
so
then
it
is
never
in
the
same
why
not
because
if
it
were
in
the
same
it
would
be
in
something
certainly
and
we
said
that
it
could
not
be
in
itself
and
could
not
be
in
other
true
then
one
is
never
in
the
same
place
it
would
seem
not
but
that
which
is
never
in
the
same
place
is
never
quiet
or
at
rest
never
one
then
as
would
seem
is
neither
at
rest
nor
in
motion
it
certainly
appears
so
neither
will
it
be
the
same
with
itself
or
other
nor
again
other
than
itself
or
other
how
is
that
if
other
than
itself
it
would
be
other
than
one
and
would
not
be
one
true
and
if
the
same
with
other
it
would
be
that
other
and
not
itself
so
that
upon
this
supposition
too
it
would
not
have
the
nature
of
one
but
would
be
other
than
one
it
would
then
it
will
not
be
the
same
with
other
or
other
than
itself
it
will
not
neither
will
it
be
other
than
other
while
it
remains
one
for
not
one
but
only
other
can
be
other
than
other
and
nothing
else
true
then
not
by
virtue
of
being
one
will
it
be
other
certainly
not
but
if
not
by
virtue
of
being
one
not
by
virtue
of
itself
and
if
not
by
virtue
of
itself
not
itself
and
itself
not
being
other
at
all
will
not
be
other
than
anything
right
neither
will
one
be
the
same
with
itself
how
not
surely
the
nature
of
the
one
is
not
the
nature
of
the
same
why
not
it
is
not
when
anything
becomes
the
same
with
anything
that
it
becomes
one
what
of
that
anything
which
becomes
the
same
with
the
many
necessarily
becomes
many
and
not
one
true
but
if
there
were
no
difference
between
the
one
and
the
same
when
a
thing
became
the
same
it
would
always
become
one
and
when
it
became
one
the
same
certainly
and
therefore
if
one
be
the
same
with
itself
it
is
not
one
with
itself
and
will
therefore
be
one
and
also
not
one
surely
that
is
impossible
and
therefore
the
one
can
neither
be
other
than
other
nor
the
same
with
itself
impossible
and
thus
the
one
can
neither
be
the
same
nor
other
either
in
relation
to
itself
or
other
no
neither
will
the
one
be
like
anything
or
unlike
itself
or
other
why
not
because
likeness
is
sameness
of
affections
yes
and
sameness
has
been
shown
to
be
of
a
nature
distinct
from
oneness
that
has
been
shown
but
if
the
one
had
any
other
affection
than
that
of
being
one
it
would
be
affected
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
more
than
one
which
is
impossible
true
then
the
one
can
never
be
so
affected
as
to
be
the
same
either
with
another
or
with
itself
clearly
not
then
it
can
not
be
like
another
or
like
itself
no
nor
can
it
be
affected
so
as
to
be
other
for
then
it
would
be
affected
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
more
than
one
it
would
that
which
is
affected
otherwise
than
itself
or
another
will
be
unlike
itself
or
another
for
sameness
of
affections
is
likeness
true
but
the
one
as
appears
never
being
affected
otherwise
is
never
unlike
itself
or
other
never
then
the
one
will
never
be
either
like
or
unlike
itself
or
other
plainly
not
again
being
of
this
nature
it
can
neither
be
equal
nor
unequal
either
to
itself
or
to
other
how
is
that
why
because
the
one
if
equal
must
be
of
the
same
measures
as
that
to
which
it
is
equal
true
and
if
greater
or
less
than
things
which
are
commensurable
with
it
the
one
will
have
more
measures
than
that
which
is
less
and
fewer
than
that
which
is
greater
yes
and
so
of
things
which
are
not
commensurate
with
it
the
one
will
have
greater
measures
than
that
which
is
less
and
smaller
than
that
which
is
greater
certainly
but
how
can
that
which
does
not
partake
of
sameness
have
either
the
same
measures
or
have
anything
else
the
same
impossible
and
not
having
the
same
measures
the
one
can
not
be
equal
either
with
itself
or
with
another
it
appears
so
but
again
whether
it
have
fewer
or
more
measures
it
will
have
as
many
parts
as
it
has
measures
and
thus
again
the
one
will
be
no
longer
one
but
will
have
as
many
parts
as
measures
right
and
if
it
were
of
one
measure
it
would
be
equal
to
that
measure
yet
it
has
been
shown
to
be
incapable
of
equality
it
has
then
it
will
neither
partake
of
one
measure
nor
of
many
nor
of
few
nor
of
the
same
at
all
nor
be
equal
to
itself
or
another
nor
be
greater
or
less
than
itself
or
other
certainly
well
and
do
we
suppose
that
one
can
be
older
or
younger
than
anything
or
of
the
same
age
with
it
why
not
why
because
that
which
is
of
the
same
age
with
itself
or
other
must
partake
of
equality
or
likeness
of
time
and
we
said
that
the
one
did
not
partake
either
of
equality
or
of
likeness
we
did
say
so
and
we
also
said
that
it
did
not
partake
of
inequality
or
unlikeness
very
true
how
then
can
one
being
of
this
nature
be
either
older
or
younger
than
anything
or
have
the
same
age
with
it
in
no
way
then
one
can
not
be
older
or
younger
or
of
the
same
age
either
with
itself
or
with
another
clearly
not
then
the
one
being
of
this
nature
can
not
be
in
time
at
all
for
must
not
that
which
is
in
time
be
always
growing
older
than
itself
certainly
and
that
which
is
older
must
always
be
older
than
something
which
is
younger
true
then
that
which
becomes
older
than
itself
also
becomes
at
the
same
time
younger
than
itself
if
it
is
to
have
something
to
become
older
than
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
a
thing
does
not
need
to
become
different
from
another
thing
which
is
already
different
it
is
different
and
if
its
different
has
become
it
has
become
different
if
its
different
will
be
it
will
be
different
but
of
that
which
is
becoming
different
there
can
not
have
been
or
be
about
to
be
or
yet
be
a
different
the
only
different
possible
is
one
which
is
becoming
that
is
inevitable
but
surely
the
elder
is
a
difference
relative
to
the
younger
and
to
nothing
else
true
then
that
which
becomes
older
than
itself
must
also
at
the
same
time
become
younger
than
itself
yes
but
again
it
is
true
that
it
can
not
become
for
a
longer
or
for
a
shorter
time
than
itself
but
it
must
become
and
be
and
have
become
and
be
about
to
be
for
the
same
time
with
itself
that
again
is
inevitable
then
things
which
are
in
time
and
partake
of
time
must
in
every
case
i
suppose
be
of
the
same
age
with
themselves
and
must
also
become
at
once
older
and
younger
than
themselves
yes
but
the
one
did
not
partake
of
those
affections
not
at
all
then
it
does
not
partake
of
time
and
is
not
in
any
time
so
the
argument
shows
well
but
do
not
the
expressions
and
become
and
becoming
signify
a
participation
of
past
time
certainly
and
do
not
be
become
have
become
signify
a
participation
of
future
time
yes
and
or
signifies
a
participation
of
present
time
certainly
and
if
the
one
is
absolutely
without
participation
in
time
it
never
had
become
or
was
becoming
or
was
at
any
time
or
is
now
become
or
is
becoming
or
is
or
will
become
or
will
have
become
or
will
be
hereafter
most
true
but
are
there
any
modes
of
partaking
of
being
other
than
these
there
are
none
then
the
one
can
not
possibly
partake
of
being
that
is
the
inference
then
the
one
is
not
at
all
clearly
not
then
the
one
does
not
exist
in
such
way
as
to
be
one
for
if
it
were
and
partook
of
being
it
would
already
be
but
if
the
argument
is
to
be
trusted
the
one
neither
is
nor
is
one
true
but
that
which
is
not
admits
of
no
attribute
or
relation
of
course
not
then
there
is
no
name
nor
expression
nor
perception
nor
opinion
nor
knowledge
of
it
clearly
not
then
it
is
neither
named
nor
expressed
nor
opined
nor
known
nor
does
anything
that
is
perceive
it
so
we
must
infer
but
can
all
this
be
true
about
the
one
i
think
not
suppose
now
that
we
return
once
more
to
the
original
hypothesis
let
us
see
whether
on
a
further
review
any
new
aspect
of
the
question
appears
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
do
so
we
say
that
we
have
to
work
out
together
all
the
consequences
whatever
they
may
be
which
follow
if
the
one
is
yes
then
we
will
begin
at
the
beginning
if
one
is
can
one
be
and
not
partake
of
being
impossible
then
the
one
will
have
being
but
its
being
will
not
be
the
same
with
the
one
for
if
the
same
it
would
not
be
the
being
of
the
one
nor
would
the
one
have
participated
in
being
for
the
proposition
that
one
is
would
have
been
identical
with
the
proposition
that
one
is
one
but
our
hypothesis
is
not
if
one
is
one
what
will
follow
but
if
one
is
am
i
not
right
quite
right
we
mean
to
say
that
being
has
not
the
same
significance
as
one
of
course
and
when
we
put
them
together
shortly
and
say
is
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
of
being
quite
true
once
more
then
let
us
ask
if
one
is
what
will
follow
does
not
this
hypothesis
necessarily
imply
that
one
is
of
such
a
nature
as
to
have
parts
how
so
in
this
way
if
being
is
predicated
of
the
one
if
the
one
is
and
one
of
being
if
being
is
one
and
if
being
and
one
are
not
the
same
and
since
the
one
which
we
have
assumed
is
must
not
the
whole
if
it
is
one
itself
be
and
have
for
its
parts
one
and
being
certainly
and
is
each
of
these
parts
one
and
being
to
be
simply
called
a
part
or
must
the
word
be
relative
to
the
word
the
latter
then
that
which
is
one
is
both
a
whole
and
has
a
part
certainly
again
of
the
parts
of
the
one
if
it
is
i
mean
being
and
one
does
either
fail
to
imply
the
other
is
the
one
wanting
to
being
or
being
to
the
one
impossible
thus
each
of
the
parts
also
has
in
turn
both
one
and
being
and
is
at
the
least
made
up
of
two
parts
and
the
same
principle
goes
on
for
ever
and
every
part
whatever
has
always
these
two
parts
for
being
always
involves
one
and
one
being
so
that
one
is
always
disappearing
and
becoming
two
certainly
and
so
the
one
if
it
is
must
be
infinite
in
multiplicity
clearly
let
us
take
another
direction
what
direction
we
say
that
the
one
partakes
of
being
and
therefore
it
is
yes
and
in
this
way
the
one
if
it
has
being
has
turned
out
to
be
many
true
but
now
let
us
abstract
the
one
which
as
we
say
partakes
of
being
and
try
to
imagine
it
apart
from
that
of
which
as
we
say
it
partakes
will
this
abstract
one
be
one
only
or
many
one
i
think
let
us
see
must
not
the
being
of
one
be
other
than
one
for
the
one
is
not
being
but
considered
as
one
only
partook
of
being
certainly
if
being
and
the
one
be
two
different
things
it
is
not
because
the
one
is
one
that
it
is
other
than
being
nor
because
being
is
being
that
it
is
other
than
the
one
but
they
differ
from
one
another
in
virtue
of
otherness
and
difference
certainly
so
that
the
other
is
not
the
same
either
with
the
one
or
with
being
certainly
not
and
therefore
whether
we
take
being
and
the
other
or
being
and
the
one
or
the
one
and
the
other
in
every
such
case
we
take
two
things
which
may
be
rightly
called
both
how
so
in
this
way
you
may
speak
of
being
yes
and
also
of
one
yes
then
now
we
have
spoken
of
either
of
them
yes
well
and
when
i
speak
of
being
and
one
i
speak
of
them
both
certainly
and
if
i
speak
of
being
and
the
other
or
of
the
one
and
the
other
in
any
such
case
do
i
not
speak
of
both
yes
and
must
not
that
which
is
correctly
called
both
be
also
two
undoubtedly
and
of
two
things
how
can
either
by
any
possibility
not
be
one
it
can
not
then
if
the
individuals
of
the
pair
are
together
two
they
must
be
severally
one
clearly
and
if
each
of
them
is
one
then
by
the
addition
of
any
one
to
any
pair
the
whole
becomes
three
yes
and
three
are
odd
and
two
are
even
of
course
and
if
there
are
two
there
must
also
be
twice
and
if
there
are
three
there
must
be
thrice
that
is
if
twice
one
makes
two
and
thrice
one
three
certainly
there
are
two
and
twice
and
therefore
there
must
be
twice
two
and
there
are
three
and
there
is
thrice
and
therefore
there
must
be
thrice
three
of
course
if
there
are
three
and
twice
there
is
twice
three
and
if
there
are
two
and
thrice
there
is
thrice
two
undoubtedly
here
then
we
have
even
taken
even
times
and
odd
taken
odd
times
and
even
taken
odd
times
and
odd
taken
even
times
true
and
if
this
is
so
does
any
number
remain
which
has
no
necessity
to
be
none
whatever
then
if
one
is
number
must
also
be
it
must
but
if
there
is
number
there
must
also
be
many
and
infinite
multiplicity
of
being
for
number
is
infinite
in
multiplicity
and
partakes
also
of
being
am
i
not
right
certainly
and
if
all
number
participates
in
being
every
part
of
number
will
also
participate
yes
then
being
is
distributed
over
the
whole
multitude
of
things
and
nothing
that
is
however
small
or
however
great
is
devoid
of
it
and
indeed
the
very
supposition
of
this
is
absurd
for
how
can
that
which
is
be
devoid
of
being
in
no
way
and
it
is
divided
into
the
greatest
and
into
the
smallest
and
into
being
of
all
sizes
and
is
broken
up
more
than
all
things
the
divisions
of
it
have
no
limit
true
then
it
has
the
greatest
number
of
parts
yes
the
greatest
number
is
there
any
of
these
which
is
a
part
of
being
and
yet
no
part
impossible
but
if
it
is
at
all
and
so
long
as
it
is
it
must
be
one
and
can
not
be
none
certainly
then
the
one
attaches
to
every
single
part
of
being
and
does
not
fail
in
any
part
whether
great
or
small
or
whatever
may
be
the
size
of
it
true
but
reflect
can
one
in
its
entirety
be
in
many
places
at
the
same
time
no
i
see
the
impossibility
of
that
and
if
not
in
its
entirety
then
it
is
divided
for
it
can
not
be
present
with
all
the
parts
of
being
unless
divided
true
and
that
which
has
parts
will
be
as
many
as
the
parts
are
certainly
then
we
were
wrong
in
saying
just
now
that
being
was
distributed
into
the
greatest
number
of
parts
for
it
is
not
distributed
into
parts
more
than
the
one
into
parts
equal
to
the
one
the
one
is
never
wanting
to
being
or
being
to
the
one
but
being
two
they
are
and
certainly
that
is
true
the
one
itself
then
having
been
broken
up
into
parts
by
being
is
many
and
infinite
true
then
not
only
the
one
which
has
being
is
many
but
the
one
itself
distributed
by
being
must
also
be
many
certainly
further
inasmuch
as
the
parts
are
parts
of
a
whole
the
one
as
a
whole
will
be
limited
for
are
not
the
parts
contained
by
the
whole
certainly
and
that
which
contains
is
a
limit
of
course
then
the
one
if
it
has
being
is
one
and
many
whole
and
parts
having
limits
and
yet
unlimited
in
number
clearly
and
because
having
limits
also
having
extremes
certainly
and
if
a
whole
having
beginning
and
middle
and
end
for
can
anything
be
a
whole
without
these
three
and
if
any
one
of
them
is
wanting
to
anything
will
that
any
longer
be
a
whole
no
then
the
one
as
appears
will
have
beginning
middle
and
end
it
will
but
again
the
middle
will
be
equidistant
from
the
extremes
or
it
would
not
be
in
the
middle
yes
then
the
one
will
partake
of
figure
either
rectilinear
or
round
or
a
union
of
the
two
true
and
if
this
is
the
case
it
will
be
both
in
itself
and
in
another
too
how
every
part
is
in
the
whole
and
none
is
outside
the
whole
true
and
all
the
parts
are
contained
by
the
whole
yes
and
the
one
is
all
its
parts
and
neither
more
nor
less
than
all
no
and
the
one
is
the
whole
of
course
but
if
all
the
parts
are
in
the
whole
and
the
one
is
all
of
them
and
the
whole
and
they
are
all
contained
by
the
whole
the
one
will
be
contained
by
the
one
and
thus
the
one
will
be
in
itself
that
is
true
but
then
again
the
whole
is
not
in
the
parts
neither
in
all
the
parts
nor
in
some
one
of
them
for
if
it
is
in
all
it
must
be
in
one
for
if
there
were
any
one
in
which
it
was
not
it
could
not
be
in
all
the
parts
for
the
part
in
which
it
is
wanting
is
one
of
all
and
if
the
whole
is
not
in
this
how
can
it
be
in
them
all
it
can
not
nor
can
the
whole
be
in
some
of
the
parts
for
if
the
whole
were
in
some
of
the
parts
the
greater
would
be
in
the
less
which
is
impossible
yes
impossible
but
if
the
whole
is
neither
in
one
nor
in
more
than
one
nor
in
all
of
the
parts
it
must
be
in
something
else
or
cease
to
be
anywhere
at
all
certainly
if
it
were
nowhere
it
would
be
nothing
but
being
a
whole
and
not
being
in
itself
it
must
be
in
another
very
true
the
one
then
regarded
as
a
whole
is
in
another
but
regarded
as
being
all
its
parts
is
in
itself
and
therefore
the
one
must
be
itself
in
itself
and
also
in
another
certainly
the
one
then
being
of
this
nature
is
of
necessity
both
at
rest
and
in
motion
how
the
one
is
at
rest
since
it
is
in
itself
for
being
in
one
and
not
passing
out
of
this
it
is
in
the
same
which
is
itself
true
and
that
which
is
ever
in
the
same
must
be
ever
at
rest
certainly
well
and
must
not
that
on
the
contrary
which
is
ever
in
other
never
be
in
the
same
and
if
never
in
the
same
never
at
rest
and
if
not
at
rest
in
motion
true
then
the
one
being
always
itself
in
itself
and
other
must
always
be
both
at
rest
and
in
motion
clearly
and
must
be
the
same
with
itself
and
other
than
itself
and
also
the
same
with
the
others
and
other
than
the
others
this
follows
from
its
previous
affections
how
so
everything
in
relation
to
every
other
thing
is
either
the
same
or
other
or
if
neither
the
same
nor
other
then
in
the
relation
of
a
part
to
a
whole
or
of
a
whole
to
a
part
clearly
and
is
the
one
a
part
of
itself
certainly
not
since
it
is
not
a
part
in
relation
to
itself
it
can
not
be
related
to
itself
as
whole
to
part
it
can
not
but
is
the
one
other
than
one
no
and
therefore
not
other
than
itself
certainly
not
if
then
it
be
neither
other
nor
a
whole
nor
a
part
in
relation
to
itself
must
it
not
be
the
same
with
itself
certainly
but
then
again
a
thing
which
is
in
another
place
from
if
this
remains
in
the
same
place
with
itself
must
be
other
than
for
it
will
be
in
another
place
true
then
the
one
has
been
shown
to
be
at
once
in
itself
and
in
another
yes
thus
then
as
appears
the
one
will
be
other
than
itself
true
well
then
if
anything
be
other
than
anything
will
it
not
be
other
than
that
which
is
other
certainly
and
will
not
all
things
that
are
not
one
be
other
than
the
one
and
the
one
other
than
the
of
course
then
the
one
will
be
other
than
the
others
true
but
consider
are
not
the
absolute
same
and
the
absolute
other
opposites
to
one
another
of
course
then
will
the
same
ever
be
in
the
other
or
the
other
in
the
same
they
will
not
if
then
the
other
is
never
in
the
same
there
is
nothing
in
which
the
other
is
during
any
space
of
time
for
during
that
space
of
time
however
small
the
other
would
be
in
the
same
is
not
that
true
yes
and
since
the
other
is
never
in
the
same
it
can
never
be
in
anything
that
is
true
then
the
other
will
never
be
either
in
the
or
in
the
one
certainly
not
then
not
by
reason
of
otherness
is
the
one
other
than
the
or
the
other
than
the
one
no
nor
by
reason
of
themselves
will
they
be
other
than
one
another
if
not
partaking
of
the
other
how
can
they
be
but
if
they
are
not
other
either
by
reason
of
themselves
or
of
the
other
will
they
not
altogether
escape
being
other
than
one
another
they
will
again
the
can
not
partake
of
the
one
otherwise
it
would
not
have
been
but
would
have
been
in
some
way
one
true
nor
can
the
be
number
for
having
number
it
would
not
have
been
at
all
it
would
not
again
is
the
part
of
the
one
or
rather
would
it
not
in
that
case
partake
of
the
one
it
would
if
then
in
every
point
of
view
the
one
and
the
are
distinct
then
neither
is
the
one
part
or
whole
of
the
nor
is
the
part
or
whole
of
the
one
no
but
we
said
that
things
which
are
neither
parts
nor
wholes
of
one
another
nor
other
than
one
another
will
be
the
same
with
one
another
so
we
said
yes
then
shall
we
say
that
the
one
being
in
this
relation
to
the
is
the
same
with
it
let
us
say
so
then
it
is
the
same
with
itself
and
the
others
and
also
other
than
itself
and
the
others
that
appears
to
be
the
inference
and
it
will
also
be
like
and
unlike
itself
and
the
others
perhaps
since
the
one
was
shown
to
be
other
than
the
others
the
others
will
also
be
other
than
the
one
yes
and
the
one
is
other
than
the
others
in
the
same
degree
that
the
others
are
other
than
it
and
neither
more
nor
less
true
and
if
neither
more
nor
less
then
in
a
like
degree
yes
in
virtue
of
the
affection
by
which
the
one
is
other
than
others
and
others
in
like
manner
other
than
it
the
one
will
be
affected
like
the
others
and
the
others
like
the
one
how
do
you
mean
i
may
take
as
an
illustration
the
case
of
names
you
give
a
name
to
a
thing
yes
and
you
may
say
the
name
once
or
oftener
yes
and
when
you
say
it
once
you
mention
that
of
which
it
is
the
name
and
when
more
than
once
is
it
something
else
which
you
mention
or
must
it
always
be
the
same
thing
of
which
you
speak
whether
you
utter
the
name
once
or
more
than
once
of
course
it
is
the
same
and
is
not
a
name
given
to
a
thing
certainly
whenever
then
you
use
the
word
whether
once
or
oftener
you
name
that
of
which
it
is
the
name
and
to
no
other
do
you
give
the
name
true
then
when
we
say
that
the
others
are
other
than
the
one
and
the
one
other
than
the
others
in
repeating
the
word
we
speak
of
that
nature
to
which
the
name
is
applied
and
of
no
other
quite
true
then
the
one
which
is
other
than
others
and
the
other
which
is
other
than
the
one
in
that
the
word
is
applied
to
both
will
be
in
the
same
condition
and
that
which
is
in
the
same
condition
is
like
yes
then
in
virtue
of
the
affection
by
which
the
one
is
other
than
the
others
every
thing
will
be
like
every
thing
for
every
thing
is
other
than
every
thing
true
again
the
like
is
opposed
to
the
unlike
yes
and
the
other
to
the
same
true
again
and
the
one
was
also
shown
to
be
the
same
with
the
others
yes
and
to
be
the
same
with
the
others
is
the
opposite
of
being
other
than
the
others
certainly
and
in
that
it
was
other
it
was
shown
to
be
like
yes
but
in
that
it
was
the
same
it
will
be
unlike
by
virtue
of
the
opposite
affection
to
that
which
made
it
like
and
this
was
the
affection
of
otherness
yes
the
same
then
will
make
it
unlike
otherwise
it
will
not
be
the
opposite
of
the
other
true
then
the
one
will
be
both
like
and
unlike
the
others
like
in
so
far
as
it
is
other
and
unlike
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
same
yes
that
argument
may
be
used
and
there
is
another
argument
what
in
so
far
as
it
is
affected
in
the
same
way
it
is
not
affected
otherwise
and
not
being
affected
otherwise
is
not
unlike
and
not
being
unlike
is
like
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
affected
by
other
it
is
otherwise
and
being
otherwise
affected
is
unlike
true
then
because
the
one
is
the
same
with
the
others
and
other
than
the
others
on
either
of
these
two
grounds
or
on
both
of
them
it
will
be
both
like
and
unlike
the
others
certainly
and
in
the
same
way
as
being
other
than
itself
and
the
same
with
itself
on
either
of
these
two
grounds
and
on
both
of
them
it
will
be
like
and
unlike
itself
of
course
again
how
far
can
the
one
touch
or
not
touch
itself
and
others
consider
i
am
considering
the
one
was
shown
to
be
in
itself
which
was
a
whole
true
and
also
in
other
things
yes
in
so
far
as
it
is
in
other
things
it
would
touch
other
things
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
in
itself
it
would
be
debarred
from
touching
them
and
would
touch
itself
only
clearly
then
the
inference
is
that
it
would
touch
both
it
would
but
what
do
you
say
to
a
new
point
of
view
must
not
that
which
is
to
touch
another
be
next
to
that
which
it
is
to
touch
and
occupy
the
place
nearest
to
that
in
which
what
it
touches
is
situated
true
then
the
one
if
it
is
to
touch
itself
ought
to
be
situated
next
to
itself
and
occupy
the
place
next
to
that
in
which
itself
is
it
ought
and
that
would
require
that
the
one
should
be
two
and
be
in
two
places
at
once
and
this
while
it
is
one
will
never
happen
no
then
the
one
can
not
touch
itself
any
more
than
it
can
be
two
it
can
not
neither
can
it
touch
others
why
not
the
reason
is
that
whatever
is
to
touch
another
must
be
in
separation
from
and
next
to
that
which
it
is
to
touch
and
no
third
thing
can
be
between
them
true
two
things
then
at
the
least
are
necessary
to
make
contact
possible
they
are
and
if
to
the
two
a
third
be
added
in
due
order
the
number
of
terms
will
be
three
and
the
contacts
two
yes
and
every
additional
term
makes
one
additional
contact
whence
it
follows
that
the
contacts
are
one
less
in
number
than
the
terms
the
first
two
terms
exceeded
the
number
of
contacts
by
one
and
the
whole
number
of
terms
exceeds
the
whole
number
of
contacts
by
one
in
like
manner
and
for
every
one
which
is
afterwards
added
to
the
number
of
terms
one
contact
is
added
to
the
contacts
true
whatever
is
the
whole
number
of
things
the
contacts
will
be
always
one
less
true
but
if
there
be
only
one
and
not
two
there
will
be
no
contact
how
can
there
be
and
do
we
not
say
that
the
others
being
other
than
the
one
are
not
one
and
have
no
part
in
the
one
true
then
they
have
no
number
if
they
have
no
one
in
them
of
course
not
then
the
others
are
neither
one
nor
two
nor
are
they
called
by
the
name
of
any
number
no
one
then
alone
is
one
and
two
do
not
exist
clearly
not
and
if
there
are
not
two
there
is
no
contact
there
is
not
then
neither
does
the
one
touch
the
others
nor
the
others
the
one
if
there
is
no
contact
certainly
not
for
all
which
reasons
the
one
touches
and
does
not
touch
itself
and
the
others
true
further
is
the
one
equal
and
unequal
to
itself
and
others
how
do
you
mean
if
the
one
were
greater
or
less
than
the
others
or
the
others
greater
or
less
than
the
one
they
would
not
be
greater
or
less
than
each
other
in
virtue
of
their
being
the
one
and
the
others
but
if
in
addition
to
their
being
what
they
are
they
had
equality
they
would
be
equal
to
one
another
or
if
the
one
had
smallness
and
the
others
greatness
or
the
one
had
greatness
and
the
others
smallness
whichever
kind
had
greatness
would
be
greater
and
whichever
had
smallness
would
be
smaller
certainly
then
there
are
two
such
ideas
as
greatness
and
smallness
for
if
they
were
not
they
could
not
be
opposed
to
each
other
and
be
present
in
that
which
is
how
could
they
if
then
smallness
is
present
in
the
one
it
will
be
present
either
in
the
whole
or
in
a
part
of
the
whole
certainly
suppose
the
first
it
will
be
either
and
with
the
whole
one
or
will
contain
the
one
clearly
if
it
be
with
the
one
it
will
be
with
the
one
or
if
containing
the
one
it
will
be
greater
than
the
one
of
course
but
can
smallness
be
equal
to
anything
or
greater
than
anything
and
have
the
functions
of
greatness
and
equality
and
not
its
own
functions
impossible
then
smallness
can
not
be
in
the
whole
of
one
but
if
at
all
in
a
part
only
yes
and
surely
not
in
all
of
a
part
for
then
the
difficulty
of
the
whole
will
recur
it
will
be
equal
to
or
greater
than
any
part
in
which
it
is
certainly
then
smallness
will
not
be
in
anything
whether
in
a
whole
or
in
a
part
nor
will
there
be
anything
small
but
actual
smallness
true
neither
will
greatness
be
in
the
one
for
if
greatness
be
in
anything
there
will
be
something
greater
other
and
besides
greatness
itself
namely
that
in
which
greatness
is
and
this
too
when
the
small
itself
is
not
there
which
the
one
if
it
is
great
must
exceed
this
however
is
impossible
seeing
that
smallness
is
wholly
absent
true
but
absolute
greatness
is
only
greater
than
absolute
smallness
and
smallness
is
only
smaller
than
absolute
greatness
very
true
then
other
things
not
greater
or
less
than
the
one
if
they
have
neither
greatness
nor
smallness
nor
have
greatness
or
smallness
any
power
of
exceeding
or
being
exceeded
in
relation
to
the
one
but
only
in
relation
to
one
another
nor
will
the
one
be
greater
or
less
than
them
or
others
if
it
has
neither
greatness
nor
smallness
clearly
not
then
if
the
one
is
neither
greater
nor
less
than
the
others
it
can
not
either
exceed
or
be
exceeded
by
them
certainly
not
and
that
which
neither
exceeds
nor
is
exceeded
must
be
on
an
equality
and
being
on
an
equality
must
be
equal
of
course
and
this
will
be
true
also
of
the
relation
of
the
one
to
itself
having
neither
greatness
nor
smallness
in
itself
it
will
neither
exceed
nor
be
exceeded
by
itself
but
will
be
on
an
equality
with
and
equal
to
itself
certainly
then
the
one
will
be
equal
both
to
itself
and
the
others
clearly
so
and
yet
the
one
being
itself
in
itself
will
also
surround
and
be
without
itself
and
as
containing
itself
will
be
greater
than
itself
and
as
contained
in
itself
will
be
less
and
will
thus
be
greater
and
less
than
itself
it
will
now
there
can
not
possibly
be
anything
which
is
not
included
in
the
one
and
the
others
of
course
not
but
surely
that
which
is
must
always
be
somewhere
yes
but
that
which
is
in
anything
will
be
less
and
that
in
which
it
is
will
be
greater
in
no
other
way
can
one
thing
be
in
another
true
and
since
there
is
nothing
other
or
besides
the
one
and
the
others
and
they
must
be
in
something
must
they
not
be
in
one
another
the
one
in
the
others
and
the
others
in
the
one
if
they
are
to
be
anywhere
that
is
clear
but
inasmuch
as
the
one
is
in
the
others
the
others
will
be
greater
than
the
one
because
they
contain
the
one
which
will
be
less
than
the
others
because
it
is
contained
in
them
and
inasmuch
as
the
others
are
in
the
one
the
one
on
the
same
principle
will
be
greater
than
the
others
and
the
others
less
than
the
one
true
the
one
then
will
be
equal
to
and
greater
and
less
than
itself
and
the
others
clearly
and
if
it
be
greater
and
less
and
equal
it
will
be
of
equal
and
more
and
less
measures
or
divisions
than
itself
and
the
others
and
if
of
measures
also
of
parts
of
course
and
if
of
equal
and
more
and
less
measures
or
divisions
it
will
be
in
number
more
or
less
than
itself
and
the
others
and
likewise
equal
in
number
to
itself
and
to
the
others
how
is
that
it
will
be
of
more
measures
than
those
things
which
it
exceeds
and
of
as
many
parts
as
measures
and
so
with
that
to
which
it
is
equal
and
that
than
which
it
is
less
true
and
being
greater
and
less
than
itself
and
equal
to
itself
it
will
be
of
equal
measures
with
itself
and
of
more
and
fewer
measures
than
itself
and
if
of
measures
then
also
of
parts
it
will
and
being
of
equal
parts
with
itself
it
will
be
numerically
equal
to
itself
and
being
of
more
parts
more
and
being
of
less
less
than
itself
certainly
and
the
same
will
hold
of
its
relation
to
other
things
inasmuch
as
it
is
greater
than
them
it
will
be
more
in
number
than
them
and
inasmuch
as
it
is
smaller
it
will
be
less
in
number
and
inasmuch
as
it
is
equal
in
size
to
other
things
it
will
be
equal
to
them
in
number
certainly
once
more
then
as
would
appear
the
one
will
be
in
number
both
equal
to
and
more
and
less
than
both
itself
and
all
other
things
it
will
does
the
one
also
partake
of
time
and
is
it
and
does
it
become
older
and
younger
than
itself
and
others
and
again
neither
younger
nor
older
than
itself
and
others
by
virtue
of
participation
in
time
how
do
you
mean
if
one
is
being
must
be
predicated
of
it
yes
but
to
be
einai
is
only
participation
of
being
in
present
time
and
to
have
been
is
the
participation
of
being
at
a
past
time
and
to
be
about
to
be
is
the
participation
of
being
at
a
future
time
very
true
then
the
one
since
it
partakes
of
being
partakes
of
time
certainly
and
is
not
time
always
moving
forward
yes
then
the
one
is
always
becoming
older
than
itself
since
it
moves
forward
in
time
certainly
and
do
you
remember
that
the
older
becomes
older
than
that
which
becomes
younger
i
remember
then
since
the
one
becomes
older
than
itself
it
becomes
younger
at
the
same
time
certainly
thus
then
the
one
becomes
older
as
well
as
younger
than
itself
yes
and
it
is
older
is
it
not
when
in
becoming
it
gets
to
the
point
of
time
between
and
be
which
is
for
surely
in
going
from
the
past
to
the
future
it
can
not
skip
the
present
no
and
when
it
arrives
at
the
present
it
stops
from
becoming
older
and
no
longer
becomes
but
is
older
for
if
it
went
on
it
would
never
be
reached
by
the
present
for
it
is
the
nature
of
that
which
goes
on
to
touch
both
the
present
and
the
future
letting
go
the
present
and
seizing
the
future
while
in
process
of
becoming
between
them
true
but
that
which
is
becoming
can
not
skip
the
present
when
it
reaches
the
present
it
ceases
to
become
and
is
then
whatever
it
may
happen
to
be
becoming
clearly
and
so
the
one
when
in
becoming
older
it
reaches
the
present
ceases
to
become
and
is
then
older
certainly
and
it
is
older
than
that
than
which
it
was
becoming
older
and
it
was
becoming
older
than
itself
yes
and
that
which
is
older
is
older
than
that
which
is
younger
true
then
the
one
is
younger
than
itself
when
in
becoming
older
it
reaches
the
present
certainly
but
the
present
is
always
present
with
the
one
during
all
its
being
for
whenever
it
is
it
is
always
now
certainly
then
the
one
always
both
is
and
becomes
older
and
younger
than
itself
truly
and
is
it
or
does
it
become
a
longer
time
than
itself
or
an
equal
time
with
itself
an
equal
time
but
if
it
becomes
or
is
for
an
equal
time
with
itself
it
is
of
the
same
age
with
itself
of
course
and
that
which
is
of
the
same
age
is
neither
older
nor
younger
no
the
one
then
becoming
and
being
the
same
time
with
itself
neither
is
nor
becomes
older
or
younger
than
itself
i
should
say
not
and
what
are
its
relations
to
other
things
is
it
or
does
it
become
older
or
younger
than
they
i
can
not
tell
you
you
can
at
least
tell
me
that
others
than
the
one
are
more
than
the
one
other
would
have
been
one
but
the
others
have
multitude
and
are
more
than
one
they
will
have
multitude
and
a
multitude
implies
a
number
larger
than
one
of
course
and
shall
we
say
that
the
lesser
or
the
greater
is
the
first
to
come
or
to
have
come
into
existence
the
lesser
then
the
least
is
the
first
and
that
is
the
one
yes
then
the
one
of
all
things
that
have
number
is
the
first
to
come
into
being
but
all
other
things
have
also
number
being
plural
and
not
singular
they
have
and
since
it
came
into
being
first
it
must
be
supposed
to
have
come
into
being
prior
to
the
others
and
the
others
later
and
the
things
which
came
into
being
later
are
younger
than
that
which
preceded
them
and
so
the
other
things
will
be
younger
than
the
one
and
the
one
older
than
other
things
true
what
would
you
say
of
another
question
can
the
one
have
come
into
being
contrary
to
its
own
nature
or
is
that
impossible
impossible
and
yet
surely
the
one
was
shown
to
have
parts
and
if
parts
then
a
beginning
middle
and
end
yes
and
a
beginning
both
of
the
one
itself
and
of
all
other
things
comes
into
being
first
of
all
and
after
the
beginning
the
others
follow
until
you
reach
the
end
certainly
and
all
these
others
we
shall
affirm
to
be
parts
of
the
whole
and
of
the
one
which
as
soon
as
the
end
is
reached
has
become
whole
and
one
yes
that
is
what
we
shall
say
but
the
end
comes
last
and
the
one
is
of
such
a
nature
as
to
come
into
being
with
the
last
and
since
the
one
can
not
come
into
being
except
in
accordance
with
its
own
nature
its
nature
will
require
that
it
should
come
into
being
after
the
others
simultaneously
with
the
end
clearly
then
the
one
is
younger
than
the
others
and
the
others
older
than
the
one
that
also
is
clear
in
my
judgment
well
and
must
not
a
beginning
or
any
other
part
of
the
one
or
of
anything
if
it
be
a
part
and
not
parts
being
a
part
be
also
of
necessity
one
certainly
and
will
not
the
one
come
into
being
together
with
each
part
together
with
the
first
part
when
that
comes
into
being
and
together
with
the
second
part
and
with
all
the
rest
and
will
not
be
wanting
to
any
part
which
is
added
to
any
other
part
until
it
has
reached
the
last
and
become
one
whole
it
will
be
wanting
neither
to
the
middle
nor
to
the
first
nor
to
the
last
nor
to
any
of
them
while
the
process
of
becoming
is
going
on
true
then
the
one
is
of
the
same
age
with
all
the
others
so
that
if
the
one
itself
does
not
contradict
its
own
nature
it
will
be
neither
prior
nor
posterior
to
the
others
but
simultaneous
and
according
to
this
argument
the
one
will
be
neither
older
nor
younger
than
the
others
nor
the
others
than
the
one
but
according
to
the
previous
argument
the
one
will
be
older
and
younger
than
the
others
and
the
others
than
the
one
certainly
after
this
manner
then
the
one
is
and
has
become
but
as
to
its
becoming
older
and
younger
than
the
others
and
the
others
than
the
one
and
neither
older
nor
younger
what
shall
we
say
shall
we
say
as
of
being
so
also
of
becoming
or
otherwise
i
can
not
answer
but
i
can
venture
to
say
that
even
if
one
thing
were
older
or
younger
than
another
it
could
not
become
older
or
younger
in
a
greater
degree
than
it
was
at
first
for
equals
added
to
unequals
whether
to
periods
of
time
or
to
anything
else
leave
the
difference
between
them
the
same
as
at
first
of
course
then
that
which
is
can
not
become
older
or
younger
than
that
which
is
since
the
difference
of
age
is
always
the
same
the
one
is
and
has
become
older
and
the
other
younger
but
they
are
no
longer
becoming
so
true
and
the
one
which
is
does
not
therefore
become
either
older
or
younger
than
the
others
which
are
no
but
consider
whether
they
may
not
become
older
and
younger
in
another
way
in
what
way
just
as
the
one
was
proven
to
be
older
than
the
others
and
the
others
than
the
one
and
what
of
that
if
the
one
is
older
than
the
others
has
come
into
being
a
longer
time
than
the
others
yes
but
consider
again
if
we
add
equal
time
to
a
greater
and
a
less
time
will
the
greater
differ
from
the
less
time
by
an
equal
or
by
a
smaller
portion
than
before
by
a
smaller
portion
then
the
difference
between
the
age
of
the
one
and
the
age
of
the
others
will
not
be
afterwards
so
great
as
at
first
but
if
an
equal
time
be
added
to
both
of
them
they
will
differ
less
and
less
in
age
yes
and
that
which
differs
in
age
from
some
other
less
than
formerly
from
being
older
will
become
younger
in
relation
to
that
other
than
which
it
was
older
yes
younger
and
if
the
one
becomes
younger
the
others
aforesaid
will
become
older
than
they
were
before
in
relation
to
the
one
certainly
then
that
which
had
become
younger
becomes
older
relatively
to
that
which
previously
had
become
and
was
older
it
never
really
is
older
but
is
always
becoming
for
the
one
is
always
growing
on
the
side
of
youth
and
the
other
on
the
side
of
age
and
in
like
manner
the
older
is
always
in
process
of
becoming
younger
than
the
younger
for
as
they
are
always
going
in
opposite
directions
they
become
in
ways
the
opposite
to
one
another
the
younger
older
than
the
older
and
the
older
younger
than
the
younger
they
can
not
however
have
become
for
if
they
had
already
become
they
would
be
and
not
merely
become
but
that
is
impossible
for
they
are
always
becoming
both
older
and
younger
than
one
another
the
one
becomes
younger
than
the
others
because
it
was
seen
to
be
older
and
prior
and
the
others
become
older
than
the
one
because
they
came
into
being
later
and
in
the
same
way
the
others
are
in
the
same
relation
to
the
one
because
they
were
seen
to
be
older
and
prior
to
the
one
that
is
clear
inasmuch
then
one
thing
does
not
become
older
or
younger
than
another
in
that
they
always
differ
from
each
other
by
an
equal
number
the
one
can
not
become
older
or
younger
than
the
others
nor
the
others
than
the
one
but
inasmuch
as
that
which
came
into
being
earlier
and
that
which
came
into
being
later
must
continually
differ
from
each
other
by
a
different
portion
in
this
point
of
view
the
others
must
become
older
and
younger
than
the
one
and
the
one
than
the
others
certainly
for
all
these
reasons
then
the
one
is
and
becomes
older
and
younger
than
itself
and
the
others
and
neither
is
nor
becomes
older
or
younger
than
itself
or
the
others
certainly
but
since
the
one
partakes
of
time
and
partakes
of
becoming
older
and
younger
must
it
not
also
partake
of
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
of
course
it
must
then
the
one
was
and
is
and
will
be
and
was
becoming
and
is
becoming
and
will
become
certainly
and
there
is
and
was
and
will
be
something
which
is
in
relation
to
it
and
belongs
to
it
true
and
since
we
have
at
this
moment
opinion
and
knowledge
and
perception
of
the
one
there
is
opinion
and
knowledge
and
perception
of
it
quite
right
then
there
is
name
and
expression
for
it
and
it
is
named
and
expressed
and
everything
of
this
kind
which
appertains
to
other
things
appertains
to
the
one
certainly
that
is
true
yet
once
more
and
for
the
third
time
let
us
consider
if
the
one
is
both
one
and
many
as
we
have
described
and
is
neither
one
nor
many
and
participates
in
time
must
it
not
in
as
far
as
it
is
one
at
times
partake
of
being
and
in
as
far
as
it
is
not
one
at
times
not
partake
of
being
certainly
but
can
it
partake
of
being
when
not
partaking
of
being
or
not
partake
of
being
when
partaking
of
being
impossible
then
the
one
partakes
and
does
not
partake
of
being
at
different
times
for
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
partake
and
not
partake
of
the
same
true
and
is
there
not
also
a
time
at
which
it
assumes
being
and
relinquishes
being
for
how
can
it
have
and
not
have
the
same
thing
unless
it
receives
and
also
gives
it
up
at
some
time
impossible
and
the
assuming
of
being
is
what
you
would
call
becoming
i
should
and
the
relinquishing
of
being
you
would
call
destruction
i
should
the
one
then
as
would
appear
becomes
and
is
destroyed
by
taking
and
giving
up
being
certainly
and
being
one
and
many
and
in
process
of
becoming
and
being
destroyed
when
it
becomes
one
it
ceases
to
be
many
and
when
many
it
ceases
to
be
one
certainly
and
as
it
becomes
one
and
many
must
it
not
inevitably
experience
separation
and
aggregation
inevitably
and
whenever
it
becomes
like
and
unlike
it
must
be
assimilated
and
dissimilated
yes
and
when
it
becomes
greater
or
less
or
equal
it
must
grow
or
diminish
or
be
equalized
true
and
when
being
in
motion
it
rests
and
when
being
at
rest
it
changes
to
motion
it
can
surely
be
in
no
time
at
all
how
can
it
but
that
a
thing
which
is
previously
at
rest
should
be
afterwards
in
motion
or
previously
in
motion
and
afterwards
at
rest
without
experiencing
change
is
impossible
impossible
and
surely
there
can
not
be
a
time
in
which
a
thing
can
be
at
once
neither
in
motion
nor
at
rest
there
can
not
but
neither
can
it
change
without
changing
true
when
then
does
it
change
for
it
can
not
change
either
when
at
rest
or
when
in
motion
or
when
in
time
it
can
not
and
does
this
strange
thing
in
which
it
is
at
the
time
of
changing
really
exist
what
thing
the
moment
for
the
moment
seems
to
imply
a
something
out
of
which
change
takes
place
into
either
of
two
states
for
the
change
is
not
from
the
state
of
rest
as
such
nor
from
the
state
of
motion
as
such
but
there
is
this
curious
nature
which
we
call
the
moment
lying
between
rest
and
motion
not
being
in
any
time
and
into
this
and
out
of
this
what
is
in
motion
changes
into
rest
and
what
is
at
rest
into
motion
so
it
appears
and
the
one
then
since
it
is
at
rest
and
also
in
motion
will
change
to
either
for
only
in
this
way
can
it
be
in
both
and
in
changing
it
changes
in
a
moment
and
when
it
is
changing
it
will
be
in
no
time
and
will
not
then
be
either
in
motion
or
at
rest
it
will
not
and
it
will
be
in
the
same
case
in
relation
to
the
other
changes
when
it
passes
from
being
into
cessation
of
being
or
from
into
becoming
then
it
passes
between
certain
states
of
motion
and
rest
and
neither
is
nor
is
not
nor
becomes
nor
is
destroyed
very
true
and
on
the
same
principle
in
the
passage
from
one
to
many
and
from
many
to
one
the
one
is
neither
one
nor
many
neither
separated
nor
aggregated
and
in
the
passage
from
like
to
unlike
and
from
unlike
to
like
it
is
neither
like
nor
unlike
neither
in
a
state
of
assimilation
nor
of
dissimilation
and
in
the
passage
from
small
to
great
and
equal
and
back
again
it
will
be
neither
small
nor
great
nor
equal
nor
in
a
state
of
increase
or
diminution
or
equalization
true
all
these
then
are
the
affections
of
the
one
if
the
one
has
being
of
course
but
if
one
is
what
will
happen
to
the
others
is
not
that
also
to
be
considered
yes
let
us
show
then
if
one
is
what
will
be
the
affections
of
the
others
than
the
one
let
us
do
so
inasmuch
as
there
are
things
other
than
the
one
the
others
are
not
the
one
for
if
they
were
they
could
not
be
other
than
the
one
very
true
nor
are
the
others
altogether
without
the
one
but
in
a
certain
way
they
participate
in
the
one
in
what
way
because
the
others
are
other
than
the
one
inasmuch
as
they
have
parts
for
if
they
had
no
parts
they
would
be
simply
one
right
and
parts
as
we
affirm
have
relation
to
a
whole
so
we
say
and
a
whole
must
necessarily
be
one
made
up
of
many
and
the
parts
will
be
parts
of
the
one
for
each
of
the
parts
is
not
a
part
of
many
but
of
a
whole
how
do
you
mean
if
anything
were
a
part
of
many
being
itself
one
of
them
it
will
surely
be
a
part
of
itself
which
is
impossible
and
it
will
be
a
part
of
each
one
of
the
other
parts
if
of
all
for
if
not
a
part
of
some
one
it
will
be
a
part
of
all
the
others
but
this
one
and
thus
will
not
be
a
part
of
each
one
and
if
not
a
part
of
each
one
it
will
not
be
a
part
of
any
one
of
the
many
and
not
being
a
part
of
any
one
it
can
not
be
a
part
or
anything
else
of
all
those
things
of
none
of
which
it
is
anything
clearly
not
then
the
part
is
not
a
part
of
the
many
nor
of
all
but
is
of
a
certain
single
form
which
we
call
a
whole
being
one
perfect
unity
framed
out
of
all
of
this
the
part
will
be
a
part
certainly
if
then
the
others
have
parts
they
will
participate
in
the
whole
and
in
the
one
true
then
the
others
than
the
one
must
be
one
perfect
whole
having
parts
certainly
and
the
same
argument
holds
of
each
part
for
the
part
must
participate
in
the
one
for
if
each
of
the
parts
is
a
part
this
means
i
suppose
that
it
is
one
separate
from
the
rest
and
otherwise
it
is
not
each
true
but
when
we
speak
of
the
part
participating
in
the
one
it
must
clearly
be
other
than
one
for
if
not
it
would
not
merely
have
participated
but
would
have
been
one
whereas
only
the
itself
can
be
one
very
true
both
the
whole
and
the
part
must
participate
in
the
one
for
the
whole
will
be
one
whole
of
which
the
parts
will
be
parts
and
each
part
will
be
one
part
of
the
whole
which
is
the
whole
of
the
part
true
and
will
not
the
things
which
participate
in
the
one
be
other
than
it
of
course
and
the
things
which
are
other
than
the
one
will
be
many
for
if
the
things
which
are
other
than
the
one
were
neither
one
nor
more
than
one
they
would
be
nothing
true
but
seeing
that
the
things
which
participate
in
the
one
as
a
part
and
in
the
one
as
a
whole
are
more
than
one
must
not
those
very
things
which
participate
in
the
one
be
infinite
in
number
how
so
let
us
look
at
the
matter
thus
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
partaking
of
the
one
they
are
not
one
and
do
not
partake
of
the
one
at
the
very
time
when
they
are
partaking
of
it
clearly
they
do
so
then
as
multitudes
in
which
the
one
is
not
present
very
true
and
if
we
were
to
abstract
from
them
in
idea
the
very
smallest
fraction
must
not
that
least
fraction
if
it
does
not
partake
of
the
one
be
a
multitude
and
not
one
it
must
and
if
we
continue
to
look
at
the
other
side
of
their
nature
regarded
simply
and
in
itself
will
not
they
as
far
as
we
see
them
be
unlimited
in
number
certainly
and
yet
when
each
several
part
becomes
a
part
then
the
parts
have
a
limit
in
relation
to
the
whole
and
to
each
other
and
the
whole
in
relation
to
the
parts
just
so
the
result
to
the
others
than
the
one
is
that
the
union
of
themselves
and
the
one
appears
to
create
a
new
element
in
them
which
gives
to
them
limitation
in
relation
to
one
another
whereas
in
their
own
nature
they
have
no
limit
that
is
clear
then
the
others
than
the
one
both
as
whole
and
parts
are
infinite
and
also
partake
of
limit
certainly
then
they
are
both
like
and
unlike
one
another
and
themselves
how
is
that
inasmuch
as
they
are
unlimited
in
their
own
nature
they
are
all
affected
in
the
same
way
true
and
inasmuch
as
they
all
partake
of
limit
they
are
all
affected
in
the
same
way
of
course
but
inasmuch
as
their
state
is
both
limited
and
unlimited
they
are
affected
in
opposite
ways
yes
and
opposites
are
the
most
unlike
of
things
certainly
considered
then
in
regard
to
either
one
of
their
affections
they
will
be
like
themselves
and
one
another
considered
in
reference
to
both
of
them
together
most
opposed
and
most
unlike
that
appears
to
be
true
then
the
others
are
both
like
and
unlike
themselves
and
one
another
true
and
they
are
the
same
and
also
different
from
one
another
and
in
motion
and
at
rest
and
experience
every
sort
of
opposite
affection
as
may
be
proved
without
difficulty
of
them
since
they
have
been
shown
to
have
experienced
the
affections
aforesaid
true
suppose
now
that
we
leave
the
further
discussion
of
these
matters
as
evident
and
consider
again
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
one
is
whether
opposite
of
all
this
is
or
is
not
equally
true
of
the
others
by
all
means
then
let
us
begin
again
and
ask
if
one
is
what
must
be
the
affections
of
the
others
let
us
ask
that
question
must
not
the
one
be
distinct
from
the
others
and
the
others
from
the
one
why
so
why
because
there
is
nothing
else
beside
them
which
is
distinct
from
both
of
them
for
the
expression
and
the
others
includes
all
things
yes
all
things
then
we
can
not
suppose
that
there
is
anything
different
from
them
in
which
both
the
one
and
the
others
might
exist
there
is
nothing
then
the
one
and
the
others
are
never
in
the
same
true
then
they
are
separated
from
each
other
yes
and
we
surely
can
not
say
that
what
is
truly
one
has
parts
impossible
then
the
one
will
not
be
in
the
others
as
a
whole
nor
as
part
if
it
be
separated
from
the
others
and
has
no
parts
impossible
then
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
others
can
partake
of
the
one
if
they
do
not
partake
either
in
whole
or
in
part
it
would
seem
not
then
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
others
are
one
or
have
in
themselves
any
unity
there
is
not
nor
are
the
others
many
for
if
they
were
many
each
part
of
them
would
be
a
part
of
the
whole
but
now
the
others
not
partaking
in
any
way
of
the
one
are
neither
one
nor
many
nor
whole
nor
part
true
then
the
others
neither
are
nor
contain
two
or
three
if
entirely
deprived
of
the
one
true
then
the
others
are
neither
like
nor
unlike
the
one
nor
is
likeness
and
unlikeness
in
them
for
if
they
were
like
and
unlike
or
had
in
them
likeness
and
unlikeness
they
would
have
two
natures
in
them
opposite
to
one
another
that
is
clear
but
for
that
which
partakes
of
nothing
to
partake
of
two
things
was
held
by
us
to
be
impossible
impossible
then
the
others
are
neither
like
nor
unlike
nor
both
for
if
they
were
like
or
unlike
they
would
partake
of
one
of
those
two
natures
which
would
be
one
thing
and
if
they
were
both
they
would
partake
of
opposites
which
would
be
two
things
and
this
has
been
shown
to
be
impossible
true
therefore
they
are
neither
the
same
nor
other
nor
in
motion
nor
at
rest
nor
in
a
state
of
becoming
nor
of
being
destroyed
nor
greater
nor
less
nor
equal
nor
have
they
experienced
anything
else
of
the
sort
for
if
they
are
capable
of
experiencing
any
such
affection
they
will
participate
in
one
and
two
and
three
and
odd
and
even
and
in
these
as
has
been
proved
they
do
not
participate
seeing
that
they
are
altogether
and
in
every
way
devoid
of
the
one
very
true
therefore
if
one
is
the
one
is
all
things
and
also
nothing
both
in
relation
to
itself
and
to
other
things
certainly
well
and
ought
we
not
to
consider
next
what
will
be
the
consequence
if
the
one
is
not
yes
we
ought
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
hypothesis
if
the
one
is
not
is
there
any
difference
between
this
and
the
hypothesis
if
the
not
one
is
not
there
is
a
difference
certainly
is
there
a
difference
only
or
rather
are
not
the
two
expressions
if
the
one
is
not
and
if
the
not
one
is
not
entirely
opposed
they
are
entirely
opposed
and
suppose
a
person
to
say
if
greatness
is
not
if
smallness
is
not
or
anything
of
that
sort
does
he
not
mean
whenever
he
uses
such
an
expression
that
is
not
is
other
than
other
things
to
be
sure
and
so
when
he
says
one
is
not
he
clearly
means
that
what
is
other
than
all
others
we
know
what
he
means
do
we
not
yes
we
do
when
he
says
he
says
something
which
is
known
and
secondly
something
which
is
other
than
all
other
things
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
predicate
of
one
being
or
for
that
which
is
said
to
be
is
known
to
be
something
all
the
same
and
is
distinguished
from
other
things
certainly
then
i
will
begin
again
and
ask
if
one
is
not
what
are
the
consequences
in
the
first
place
as
would
appear
there
is
a
knowledge
of
it
or
the
very
meaning
of
the
words
one
is
not
would
not
be
known
true
secondly
the
others
differ
from
it
or
it
could
not
be
described
as
different
from
the
others
certainly
difference
then
belongs
to
it
as
well
as
knowledge
for
in
speaking
of
the
one
as
different
from
the
others
we
do
not
speak
of
a
difference
in
the
others
but
in
the
one
clearly
so
moreover
the
one
that
is
not
is
something
and
partakes
of
relation
to
and
and
and
the
like
and
is
an
attribute
of
for
the
one
or
the
others
than
the
one
could
not
have
been
spoken
of
nor
could
any
attribute
or
relative
of
the
one
that
is
not
have
been
or
been
spoken
of
nor
could
it
have
been
said
to
be
anything
if
it
did
not
partake
of
or
of
the
other
relations
just
now
mentioned
true
being
then
can
not
be
ascribed
to
the
one
since
it
is
not
but
the
one
that
is
not
may
or
rather
must
participate
in
many
things
if
it
and
nothing
else
is
not
if
however
neither
the
one
nor
the
one
that
is
not
is
supposed
not
to
be
and
we
are
speaking
of
something
of
a
different
nature
we
can
predicate
nothing
of
it
but
supposing
that
the
one
that
is
not
and
nothing
else
is
not
then
it
must
participate
in
the
predicate
and
in
many
others
certainly
and
it
will
have
unlikeness
in
relation
to
the
others
for
the
others
being
different
from
the
one
will
be
of
a
different
kind
certainly
and
are
not
things
of
a
different
kind
also
other
in
kind
of
course
and
are
not
things
other
in
kind
unlike
they
are
unlike
and
if
they
are
unlike
the
one
that
which
they
are
unlike
will
clearly
be
unlike
them
clearly
so
then
the
one
will
have
unlikeness
in
respect
of
which
the
others
are
unlike
it
that
would
seem
to
be
true
and
if
unlikeness
to
other
things
is
attributed
to
it
it
must
have
likeness
to
itself
how
so
if
the
one
have
unlikeness
to
one
something
else
must
be
meant
nor
will
the
hypothesis
relate
to
one
but
it
will
relate
to
something
other
than
one
quite
so
but
that
can
not
be
no
then
the
one
must
have
likeness
to
itself
it
must
again
it
is
not
equal
to
the
others
for
if
it
were
equal
then
it
would
at
once
be
and
be
like
them
in
virtue
of
the
equality
but
if
one
has
no
being
then
it
can
neither
be
nor
be
like
it
can
not
but
since
it
is
not
equal
to
the
others
neither
can
the
others
be
equal
to
it
certainly
not
and
things
that
are
not
equal
are
unequal
true
and
they
are
unequal
to
an
unequal
of
course
then
the
one
partakes
of
inequality
and
in
respect
of
this
the
others
are
unequal
to
it
very
true
and
inequality
implies
greatness
and
smallness
yes
then
the
one
if
of
such
a
nature
has
greatness
and
smallness
that
appears
to
be
true
and
greatness
and
smallness
always
stand
apart
true
then
there
is
always
something
between
them
there
is
and
can
you
think
of
anything
else
which
is
between
them
other
than
equality
no
it
is
equality
which
lies
between
them
then
that
which
has
greatness
and
smallness
also
has
equality
which
lies
between
them
that
is
clear
then
the
one
which
is
not
partakes
as
would
appear
of
greatness
and
smallness
and
equality
clearly
further
it
must
surely
in
a
sort
partake
of
being
how
so
it
must
be
so
for
if
not
then
we
should
not
speak
the
truth
in
saying
that
the
one
is
not
but
if
we
speak
the
truth
clearly
we
must
say
what
is
am
i
not
right
yes
and
since
we
affirm
that
we
speak
truly
we
must
also
affirm
that
we
say
what
is
certainly
then
as
would
appear
the
one
when
it
is
not
is
for
if
it
were
not
to
be
when
it
is
not
but
or
remit
something
of
existence
in
relation
to
were
to
relinquish
something
of
being
so
as
to
become
it
would
at
once
be
quite
true
then
the
one
which
is
not
if
it
is
to
maintain
itself
must
have
the
being
of
as
the
bond
of
just
as
being
must
have
as
a
bond
the
of
in
order
to
perfect
its
own
being
for
the
truest
assertion
of
the
being
of
being
and
of
the
of
is
when
being
partakes
of
the
being
of
being
and
not
of
the
being
of
that
is
the
perfection
of
being
and
when
does
not
partake
of
the
of
but
of
the
being
of
that
is
the
perfection
of
most
true
since
then
what
is
partakes
of
and
what
is
not
of
being
must
not
the
one
also
partake
of
being
in
order
not
to
be
certainly
then
the
one
if
it
is
not
clearly
has
being
clearly
and
has
also
if
it
is
not
of
course
but
can
anything
which
is
in
a
certain
state
not
be
in
that
state
without
changing
impossible
then
everything
which
is
and
is
not
in
a
certain
state
implies
change
certainly
and
change
is
motion
we
may
say
that
yes
motion
and
the
one
has
been
proved
both
to
be
and
not
to
be
yes
and
therefore
is
and
is
not
in
the
same
state
yes
thus
the
one
that
is
not
has
been
shown
to
have
motion
also
because
it
changes
from
being
to
that
appears
to
be
true
but
surely
if
it
is
nowhere
among
what
is
as
is
the
fact
since
it
is
not
it
can
not
change
from
one
place
to
another
impossible
then
it
can
not
move
by
changing
place
no
nor
can
it
turn
on
the
same
spot
for
it
nowhere
touches
the
same
for
the
same
is
and
that
which
is
not
can
not
be
reckoned
among
things
that
are
it
can
not
then
the
one
if
it
is
not
can
not
turn
in
that
in
which
it
is
not
no
neither
can
the
one
whether
it
is
or
is
not
be
altered
into
other
than
itself
for
if
it
altered
and
became
different
from
itself
then
we
could
not
be
still
speaking
of
the
one
but
of
something
else
true
but
if
the
one
neither
suffers
alteration
nor
turns
round
in
the
same
place
nor
changes
place
can
it
still
be
capable
of
motion
impossible
now
that
which
is
unmoved
must
surely
be
at
rest
and
that
which
is
at
rest
must
stand
still
certainly
then
the
one
that
is
not
stands
still
and
is
also
in
motion
that
seems
to
be
true
but
if
it
be
in
motion
it
must
necessarily
undergo
alteration
for
anything
which
is
moved
in
so
far
as
it
is
moved
is
no
longer
in
the
same
state
but
in
another
yes
then
the
one
being
moved
is
altered
yes
and
further
if
not
moved
in
any
way
it
will
not
be
altered
in
any
way
no
then
in
so
far
as
the
one
that
is
not
is
moved
it
is
altered
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
not
moved
it
is
not
altered
right
then
the
one
that
is
not
is
altered
and
is
not
altered
that
is
clear
and
must
not
that
which
is
altered
become
other
than
it
previously
was
and
lose
its
former
state
and
be
destroyed
but
that
which
is
not
altered
can
neither
come
into
being
nor
be
destroyed
very
true
and
the
one
that
is
not
being
altered
becomes
and
is
destroyed
and
not
being
altered
neither
becomes
nor
is
destroyed
and
so
the
one
that
is
not
becomes
and
is
destroyed
and
neither
becomes
nor
is
destroyed
true
and
now
let
us
go
back
once
more
to
the
beginning
and
see
whether
these
or
some
other
consequences
will
follow
let
us
do
as
you
say
if
one
is
not
we
ask
what
will
happen
in
respect
of
one
that
is
the
question
yes
do
not
the
words
not
signify
absence
of
being
in
that
to
which
we
apply
them
just
so
and
when
we
say
that
a
thing
is
not
do
we
mean
that
it
is
not
in
one
way
but
is
in
another
or
do
we
mean
absolutely
that
what
is
not
has
in
no
sort
or
way
or
kind
participation
of
being
quite
absolutely
then
that
which
is
not
can
not
be
or
in
any
way
participate
in
being
it
can
not
and
did
we
not
mean
by
becoming
and
being
destroyed
the
assumption
of
being
and
the
loss
of
being
nothing
else
and
can
that
which
has
no
participation
in
being
either
assume
or
lose
being
impossible
the
one
then
since
it
in
no
way
is
can
not
have
or
lose
or
assume
being
in
any
way
true
then
the
one
that
is
not
since
it
in
no
way
partakes
of
being
neither
perishes
nor
becomes
no
then
it
is
not
altered
at
all
for
if
it
were
it
would
become
and
be
destroyed
true
but
if
it
be
not
altered
it
can
not
be
moved
certainly
not
nor
can
we
say
that
it
stands
if
it
is
nowhere
for
that
which
stands
must
always
be
in
one
and
the
same
spot
of
course
then
we
must
say
that
the
one
which
is
not
never
stands
still
and
never
moves
neither
nor
is
there
any
existing
thing
which
can
be
attributed
to
it
for
if
there
had
been
it
would
partake
of
being
that
is
clear
and
therefore
neither
smallness
nor
greatness
nor
equality
can
be
attributed
to
it
no
nor
yet
likeness
nor
difference
either
in
relation
to
itself
or
to
others
clearly
not
well
and
if
nothing
should
be
attributed
to
it
can
other
things
be
attributed
to
it
certainly
not
and
therefore
other
things
can
neither
be
like
or
unlike
the
same
or
different
in
relation
to
it
they
can
not
nor
can
what
is
not
be
anything
or
be
this
thing
or
be
related
to
or
the
attribute
of
this
or
that
or
other
or
be
past
present
or
future
nor
can
knowledge
or
opinion
or
perception
or
expression
or
name
or
any
other
thing
that
is
have
any
concern
with
it
no
then
the
one
that
is
not
has
no
condition
of
any
kind
such
appears
to
be
the
conclusion
yet
once
more
if
one
is
not
what
becomes
of
the
others
let
us
determine
that
yes
let
us
determine
that
the
others
must
surely
be
for
if
they
like
the
one
were
not
we
could
not
be
now
speaking
of
them
true
but
to
speak
of
the
others
implies
difference
the
terms
and
are
synonymous
true
other
means
other
than
other
and
different
different
from
the
different
yes
then
if
there
are
to
be
others
there
is
something
than
which
they
will
be
other
certainly
and
what
can
that
be
for
if
the
one
is
not
they
will
not
be
other
than
the
one
they
will
not
then
they
will
be
other
than
each
other
for
the
only
remaining
alternative
is
that
they
are
other
than
nothing
true
and
they
are
each
other
than
one
another
as
being
plural
and
not
singular
for
if
one
is
not
they
can
not
be
singular
but
every
particle
of
them
is
infinite
in
number
and
even
if
a
person
takes
that
which
appears
to
be
the
smallest
fraction
this
which
seemed
one
in
a
moment
evanesces
into
many
as
in
a
dream
and
from
being
the
smallest
becomes
very
great
in
comparison
with
the
fractions
into
which
it
is
split
up
very
true
and
in
such
particles
the
others
will
be
other
than
one
another
if
others
are
and
the
one
is
not
exactly
and
will
there
not
be
many
particles
each
appearing
to
be
one
but
not
being
one
if
one
is
not
true
and
it
would
seem
that
number
can
be
predicated
of
them
if
each
of
them
appears
to
be
one
though
it
is
really
many
it
can
and
there
will
seem
to
be
odd
and
even
among
them
which
will
also
have
no
reality
if
one
is
not
yes
and
there
will
appear
to
be
a
least
among
them
and
even
this
will
seem
large
and
manifold
in
comparison
with
the
many
small
fractions
which
are
contained
in
it
certainly
and
each
particle
will
be
imagined
to
be
equal
to
the
many
and
little
for
it
could
not
have
appeared
to
pass
from
the
greater
to
the
less
without
having
appeared
to
arrive
at
the
middle
and
thus
would
arise
the
appearance
of
equality
yes
and
having
neither
beginning
middle
nor
end
each
separate
particle
yet
appears
to
have
a
limit
in
relation
to
itself
and
other
how
so
because
when
a
person
conceives
of
any
one
of
these
as
such
prior
to
the
beginning
another
beginning
appears
and
there
is
another
end
remaining
after
the
end
and
in
the
middle
truer
middles
within
but
smaller
because
no
unity
can
be
conceived
of
any
of
them
since
the
one
is
not
very
true
and
so
all
being
whatever
we
think
of
must
be
broken
up
into
fractions
for
a
particle
will
have
to
be
conceived
of
without
unity
certainly
and
such
being
when
seen
indistinctly
and
at
a
distance
appears
to
be
one
but
when
seen
near
and
with
keen
intellect
every
single
thing
appears
to
be
infinite
since
it
is
deprived
of
the
one
which
is
not
nothing
more
certain
then
each
of
the
others
must
appear
to
be
infinite
and
finite
and
one
and
many
if
others
than
the
one
exist
and
not
the
one
they
must
then
will
they
not
appear
to
be
like
and
unlike
in
what
way
just
as
in
a
picture
things
appear
to
be
all
one
to
a
person
standing
at
a
distance
and
to
be
in
the
same
state
and
alike
true
but
when
you
approach
them
they
appear
to
be
many
and
different
and
because
of
the
appearance
of
the
difference
different
in
kind
from
and
unlike
themselves
true
and
so
must
the
particles
appear
to
be
like
and
unlike
themselves
and
each
other
certainly
and
must
they
not
be
the
same
and
yet
different
from
one
another
and
in
contact
with
themselves
although
they
are
separated
and
having
every
sort
of
motion
and
every
sort
of
rest
and
becoming
and
being
destroyed
and
in
neither
state
and
the
like
all
which
things
may
be
easily
enumerated
if
the
one
is
not
and
the
many
are
most
true
once
more
let
us
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
ask
if
the
one
is
not
and
the
others
of
the
one
are
what
will
follow
let
us
ask
that
question
in
the
first
place
the
others
will
not
be
one
impossible
nor
will
they
be
many
for
if
they
were
many
one
would
be
contained
in
them
but
if
no
one
of
them
is
one
all
of
them
are
nought
and
therefore
they
will
not
be
many
true
if
there
be
no
one
in
the
others
the
others
are
neither
many
nor
one
they
are
not
nor
do
they
appear
either
as
one
or
many
why
not
because
the
others
have
no
sort
or
manner
or
way
of
communion
with
any
sort
of
nor
can
anything
which
is
not
be
connected
with
any
of
the
others
for
that
which
is
not
has
no
parts
true
nor
is
there
an
opinion
or
any
appearance
of
in
connexion
with
the
others
nor
is
ever
in
any
way
attributed
to
the
others
no
then
if
one
is
not
there
is
no
conception
of
any
of
the
others
either
as
one
or
many
for
you
can
not
conceive
the
many
without
the
one
you
can
not
then
if
one
is
not
the
others
neither
are
nor
can
be
conceived
to
be
either
one
or
many
it
would
seem
not
nor
as
like
or
unlike
no
nor
as
the
same
or
different
nor
in
contact
or
separation
nor
in
any
of
those
states
which
we
enumerated
as
appearing
to
be
the
others
neither
are
nor
appear
to
be
any
of
these
if
one
is
not
true
then
may
we
not
sum
up
the
argument
in
a
word
and
say
truly
if
one
is
not
then
nothing
is
certainly
let
thus
much
be
said
and
further
let
us
affirm
what
seems
to
be
the
truth
that
whether
one
is
or
is
not
one
and
the
others
in
relation
to
themselves
and
one
another
all
of
them
in
every
way
are
and
are
not
and
appear
to
be
and
appear
not
to
be
most
true
