the
secret
sharer
by
joseph
conrad
i
on
my
right
hand
there
were
lines
of
fishing
stakes
resembling
a
mysterious
system
of
bamboo
fences
incomprehensible
in
its
division
of
the
domain
of
tropical
fishes
and
crazy
of
aspect
as
if
abandoned
forever
by
some
nomad
tribe
of
fishermen
now
gone
to
the
other
end
of
the
ocean
for
there
was
no
sign
of
human
habitation
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
to
the
left
a
group
of
barren
islets
suggesting
ruins
of
stone
walls
towers
and
blockhouses
had
its
foundations
set
in
a
blue
sea
that
itself
looked
solid
so
still
and
stable
did
it
lie
below
my
feet
even
the
track
of
light
from
the
westering
sun
shone
smoothly
without
that
animated
glitter
which
tells
of
an
imperceptible
ripple
and
when
i
turned
my
head
to
take
a
parting
glance
at
the
tug
which
had
just
left
us
anchored
outside
the
bar
i
saw
the
straight
line
of
the
flat
shore
joined
to
the
stable
sea
edge
to
edge
with
a
perfect
and
unmarked
closeness
in
one
leveled
floor
half
brown
half
blue
under
the
enormous
dome
of
the
sky
corresponding
in
their
insignificance
to
the
islets
of
the
sea
two
small
clumps
of
trees
one
on
each
side
of
the
only
fault
in
the
impeccable
joint
marked
the
mouth
of
the
river
meinam
we
had
just
left
on
the
first
preparatory
stage
of
our
homeward
journey
and
far
back
on
the
inland
level
a
larger
and
loftier
mass
the
grove
surrounding
the
great
paknam
pagoda
was
the
only
thing
on
which
the
eye
could
rest
from
the
vain
task
of
exploring
the
monotonous
sweep
of
the
horizon
here
and
there
gleams
as
of
a
few
scattered
pieces
of
silver
marked
the
windings
of
the
great
river
and
on
the
nearest
of
them
just
within
the
bar
the
tug
steaming
right
into
the
land
became
lost
to
my
sight
hull
and
funnel
and
masts
as
though
the
impassive
earth
had
swallowed
her
up
without
an
effort
without
a
tremor
my
eye
followed
the
light
cloud
of
her
smoke
now
here
now
there
above
the
plain
according
to
the
devious
curves
of
the
stream
but
always
fainter
and
farther
away
till
i
lost
it
at
last
behind
the
hill
of
the
great
pagoda
and
then
i
was
left
alone
with
my
ship
anchored
at
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
siam
she
floated
at
the
starting
point
of
a
long
journey
very
still
in
an
immense
stillness
the
shadows
of
her
spars
flung
far
to
the
eastward
by
the
setting
sun
at
that
moment
i
was
alone
on
her
decks
there
was
not
a
sound
in
her
and
around
us
nothing
moved
nothing
lived
not
a
canoe
on
the
water
not
a
bird
in
the
air
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
in
this
breathless
pause
at
the
threshold
of
a
long
passage
we
seemed
to
be
measuring
our
fitness
for
a
long
and
arduous
enterprise
the
appointed
task
of
both
our
existences
to
be
carried
out
far
from
all
human
eyes
with
only
sky
and
sea
for
spectators
and
for
judges
there
must
have
been
some
glare
in
the
air
to
interfere
with
one
s
sight
because
it
was
only
just
before
the
sun
left
us
that
my
roaming
eyes
made
out
beyond
the
highest
ridges
of
the
principal
islet
of
the
group
something
which
did
away
with
the
solemnity
of
perfect
solitude
the
tide
of
darkness
flowed
on
swiftly
and
with
tropical
suddenness
a
swarm
of
stars
came
out
above
the
shadowy
earth
while
i
lingered
yet
my
hand
resting
lightly
on
my
ship
s
rail
as
if
on
the
shoulder
of
a
trusted
friend
but
with
all
that
multitude
of
celestial
bodies
staring
down
at
one
the
comfort
of
quiet
communion
with
her
was
gone
for
good
and
there
were
also
disturbing
sounds
by
this
time
voices
footsteps
forward
the
steward
flitted
along
the
a
busily
ministering
spirit
a
hand
bell
tinkled
urgently
under
the
poop
deck
i
found
my
two
officers
waiting
for
me
near
the
supper
table
in
the
lighted
cuddy
we
sat
down
at
once
and
as
i
helped
the
chief
mate
i
said
are
you
aware
that
there
is
a
ship
anchored
inside
the
islands
i
saw
her
mastheads
above
the
ridge
as
the
sun
went
he
raised
sharply
his
simple
face
overcharged
by
a
terrible
growth
of
whisker
and
emitted
his
usual
ejaculations
bless
my
soul
sir
you
don
t
say
so
my
second
mate
was
a
silent
young
man
grave
beyond
his
years
i
thought
but
as
our
eyes
happened
to
meet
i
detected
a
slight
quiver
on
his
lips
i
looked
down
at
once
it
was
not
my
part
to
encourage
sneering
on
board
my
ship
it
must
be
said
too
that
i
knew
very
little
of
my
officers
in
consequence
of
certain
events
of
no
particular
significance
except
to
myself
i
had
been
appointed
to
the
command
only
a
fortnight
before
neither
did
i
know
much
of
the
hands
forward
all
these
people
had
been
together
for
eighteen
months
or
so
and
my
position
was
that
of
the
only
stranger
on
board
i
mention
this
because
it
has
some
bearing
on
what
is
to
follow
but
what
i
felt
most
was
my
being
a
stranger
to
the
ship
and
if
all
the
truth
must
be
told
i
was
somewhat
of
a
stranger
to
myself
the
youngest
man
on
board
barring
the
second
mate
and
untried
as
yet
by
a
position
of
the
fullest
responsibility
i
was
willing
to
take
the
adequacy
of
the
others
for
granted
they
had
simply
to
be
equal
to
their
tasks
but
i
wondered
how
far
i
should
turn
out
faithful
to
that
ideal
conception
of
one
s
own
personality
every
man
sets
up
for
himself
secretly
meantime
the
chief
mate
with
an
almost
visible
effect
of
collaboration
on
the
part
of
his
round
eyes
and
frightful
whiskers
was
trying
to
evolve
a
theory
of
the
anchored
ship
his
dominant
trait
was
to
take
all
things
into
earnest
consideration
he
was
of
a
painstaking
turn
of
mind
as
he
used
to
say
he
liked
to
account
to
himself
for
practically
everything
that
came
in
his
way
down
to
a
miserable
scorpion
he
had
found
in
his
cabin
a
week
before
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
that
scorpion
how
it
got
on
board
and
came
to
select
his
room
rather
than
the
pantry
which
was
a
dark
place
and
more
what
a
scorpion
would
be
partial
to
and
how
on
earth
it
managed
to
drown
itself
in
the
inkwell
of
his
writing
desk
had
exercised
him
infinitely
the
ship
within
the
islands
was
much
more
easily
accounted
for
and
just
as
we
were
about
to
rise
from
table
he
made
his
pronouncement
she
was
he
doubted
not
a
ship
from
home
lately
arrived
probably
she
drew
too
much
water
to
cross
the
bar
except
at
the
top
of
spring
tides
therefore
she
went
into
that
natural
harbor
to
wait
for
a
few
days
in
preference
to
remaining
in
an
open
roadstead
that
s
so
confirmed
the
second
mate
suddenly
in
his
slightly
hoarse
voice
she
draws
over
twenty
feet
she
s
the
liverpool
ship
sephora
with
a
cargo
of
coal
hundred
and
days
from
we
looked
at
him
in
surprise
the
tugboat
skipper
told
me
when
he
came
on
board
for
your
letters
sir
explained
the
young
man
he
expects
to
take
her
up
the
river
the
day
after
after
thus
overwhelming
us
with
the
extent
of
his
information
he
slipped
out
of
the
cabin
the
mate
observed
regretfully
that
he
could
not
account
for
that
young
fellow
s
what
prevented
him
telling
us
all
about
it
at
once
he
wanted
to
know
i
detained
him
as
he
was
making
a
move
for
the
last
two
days
the
crew
had
had
plenty
of
hard
work
and
the
night
before
they
had
very
little
sleep
i
felt
painfully
that
i
a
stranger
was
doing
something
unusual
when
i
directed
him
to
let
all
hands
turn
in
without
setting
an
anchor
watch
i
proposed
to
keep
on
deck
myself
till
one
o
clock
or
thereabouts
i
would
get
the
second
mate
to
relieve
me
at
that
hour
he
will
turn
out
the
cook
and
the
steward
at
four
i
concluded
and
then
give
you
a
call
of
course
at
the
slightest
sign
of
any
sort
of
wind
we
ll
have
the
hands
up
and
make
a
start
at
he
concealed
his
astonishment
very
well
outside
the
cuddy
he
put
his
head
in
the
second
mate
s
door
to
inform
him
of
my
caprice
to
take
a
five
hours
anchor
watch
on
myself
i
heard
the
other
raise
his
voice
incredulously
what
the
captain
himself
then
a
few
more
murmurs
a
door
closed
then
another
a
few
moments
later
i
went
on
deck
my
strangeness
which
had
made
me
sleepless
had
prompted
that
unconventional
arrangement
as
if
i
had
expected
in
those
solitary
hours
of
the
night
to
get
on
terms
with
the
ship
of
which
i
knew
nothing
manned
by
men
of
whom
i
knew
very
little
more
fast
alongside
a
wharf
littered
like
any
ship
in
port
with
a
tangle
of
unrelated
things
invaded
by
unrelated
shore
people
i
had
hardly
seen
her
yet
properly
now
as
she
lay
cleared
for
sea
the
stretch
of
her
seemed
to
me
very
fine
under
the
stars
very
fine
very
roomy
for
her
size
and
very
inviting
i
descended
the
poop
and
paced
the
waist
my
mind
picturing
to
myself
the
coming
passage
through
the
malay
archipelago
down
the
indian
ocean
and
up
the
atlantic
all
its
phases
were
familiar
enough
to
me
every
characteristic
all
the
alternatives
which
were
likely
to
face
me
on
the
high
seas
everything
except
the
novel
responsibility
of
command
but
i
took
heart
from
the
reasonable
thought
that
the
ship
was
like
other
ships
the
men
like
other
men
and
that
the
sea
was
not
likely
to
keep
any
special
surprises
expressly
for
my
discomfiture
arrived
at
that
comforting
conclusion
i
bethought
myself
of
a
cigar
and
went
below
to
get
it
all
was
still
down
there
everybody
at
the
after
end
of
the
ship
was
sleeping
profoundly
i
came
out
again
on
the
agreeably
at
ease
in
my
sleeping
suit
on
that
warm
breathless
night
barefooted
a
glowing
cigar
in
my
teeth
and
going
forward
i
was
met
by
the
profound
silence
of
the
fore
end
of
the
ship
only
as
i
passed
the
door
of
the
forecastle
i
heard
a
deep
quiet
trustful
sigh
of
some
sleeper
inside
and
suddenly
i
rejoiced
in
the
great
security
of
the
sea
as
compared
with
the
unrest
of
the
land
in
my
choice
of
that
untempted
life
presenting
no
disquieting
problems
invested
with
an
elementary
moral
beauty
by
the
absolute
straightforwardness
of
its
appeal
and
by
the
singleness
of
its
purpose
the
riding
light
in
the
forerigging
burned
with
a
clear
untroubled
as
if
symbolic
flame
confident
and
bright
in
the
mysterious
shades
of
the
night
passing
on
my
way
aft
along
the
other
side
of
the
ship
i
observed
that
the
rope
side
ladder
put
over
no
doubt
for
the
master
of
the
tug
when
he
came
to
fetch
away
our
letters
had
not
been
hauled
in
as
it
should
have
been
i
became
annoyed
at
this
for
exactitude
in
some
small
matters
is
the
very
soul
of
discipline
then
i
reflected
that
i
had
myself
peremptorily
dismissed
my
officers
from
duty
and
by
my
own
act
had
prevented
the
anchor
watch
being
formally
set
and
things
properly
attended
to
i
asked
myself
whether
it
was
wise
ever
to
interfere
with
the
established
routine
of
duties
even
from
the
kindest
of
motives
my
action
might
have
made
me
appear
eccentric
goodness
only
knew
how
that
absurdly
whiskered
mate
would
account
for
my
conduct
and
what
the
whole
ship
thought
of
that
informality
of
their
new
captain
i
was
vexed
with
myself
not
from
compunction
certainly
but
as
it
were
mechanically
i
proceeded
to
get
the
ladder
in
myself
now
a
side
ladder
of
that
sort
is
a
light
affair
and
comes
in
easily
yet
my
vigorous
tug
which
should
have
brought
it
flying
on
board
merely
recoiled
upon
my
body
in
a
totally
unexpected
jerk
what
the
devil
i
was
so
astounded
by
the
immovableness
of
that
ladder
that
i
remained
trying
to
account
for
it
to
myself
like
that
imbecile
mate
of
mine
in
the
end
of
course
i
put
my
head
over
the
rail
the
side
of
the
ship
made
an
opaque
belt
of
shadow
on
the
darkling
glassy
shimmer
of
the
sea
but
i
saw
at
once
something
elongated
and
pale
floating
very
close
to
the
ladder
before
i
could
form
a
guess
a
faint
flash
of
phosphorescent
light
which
seemed
to
issue
suddenly
from
the
naked
body
of
a
man
flickered
in
the
sleeping
water
with
the
elusive
silent
play
of
summer
lightning
in
a
night
sky
with
a
gasp
i
saw
revealed
to
my
stare
a
pair
of
feet
the
long
legs
a
broad
livid
back
immersed
right
up
to
the
neck
in
a
greenish
cadaverous
glow
one
hand
awash
clutched
the
bottom
rung
of
the
ladder
he
was
complete
but
for
the
head
a
headless
corpse
the
cigar
dropped
out
of
my
gaping
mouth
with
a
tiny
plop
and
a
short
hiss
quite
audible
in
the
absolute
stillness
of
all
things
under
heaven
at
that
i
suppose
he
raised
up
his
face
a
dimly
pale
oval
in
the
shadow
of
the
ship
s
side
but
even
then
i
could
only
barely
make
out
down
there
the
shape
of
his
head
however
it
was
enough
for
the
horrid
sensation
which
had
gripped
me
about
the
chest
to
pass
off
the
moment
of
vain
exclamations
was
past
too
i
only
climbed
on
the
spare
spar
and
leaned
over
the
rail
as
far
as
i
could
to
bring
my
eyes
nearer
to
that
mystery
floating
alongside
as
he
hung
by
the
ladder
like
a
resting
swimmer
the
sea
lightning
played
about
his
limbs
at
every
stir
and
he
appeared
in
it
ghastly
silvery
fishlike
he
remained
as
mute
as
a
fish
too
he
made
no
motion
to
get
out
of
the
water
either
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
should
not
attempt
to
come
on
board
and
strangely
troubling
to
suspect
that
perhaps
he
did
not
want
to
and
my
first
words
were
prompted
by
just
that
troubled
incertitude
what
s
the
matter
i
asked
in
my
ordinary
tone
speaking
down
to
the
face
upturned
exactly
under
mine
cramp
it
answered
no
louder
then
slightly
anxious
i
say
no
need
to
call
i
was
not
going
to
i
said
are
you
alone
on
deck
i
had
somehow
the
impression
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
letting
go
the
ladder
to
swim
away
beyond
my
ken
mysterious
as
he
came
but
for
the
moment
this
being
appearing
as
if
he
had
risen
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
was
certainly
the
nearest
land
to
the
ship
wanted
only
to
know
the
time
i
told
him
and
he
down
there
tentatively
i
suppose
your
captain
s
turned
in
i
am
sure
he
isn
t
i
said
he
seemed
to
struggle
with
himself
for
i
heard
something
like
the
low
bitter
murmur
of
doubt
what
s
the
good
his
next
words
came
out
with
a
hesitating
effort
look
here
my
man
could
you
call
him
out
quietly
i
thought
the
time
had
come
to
declare
myself
i
am
the
i
heard
a
by
jove
whispered
at
the
level
of
the
water
the
phosphorescence
flashed
in
the
swirl
of
the
water
all
about
his
limbs
his
other
hand
seized
the
ladder
my
name
s
the
voice
was
calm
and
resolute
a
good
voice
the
of
that
man
had
somehow
induced
a
corresponding
state
in
myself
it
was
very
quietly
that
i
remarked
you
must
be
a
good
yes
i
ve
been
in
the
water
practically
since
nine
o
clock
the
question
for
me
now
is
whether
i
am
to
let
go
this
ladder
and
go
on
swimming
till
i
sink
from
exhaustion
or
to
come
on
board
i
felt
this
was
no
mere
formula
of
desperate
speech
but
a
real
alternative
in
the
view
of
a
strong
soul
i
should
have
gathered
from
this
that
he
was
young
indeed
it
is
only
the
young
who
are
ever
confronted
by
such
clear
issues
but
at
the
time
it
was
pure
intuition
on
my
part
a
mysterious
communication
was
established
already
between
us
two
in
the
face
of
that
silent
darkened
tropical
sea
i
was
young
too
young
enough
to
make
no
comment
the
man
in
the
water
began
suddenly
to
climb
up
the
ladder
and
i
hastened
away
from
the
rail
to
fetch
some
clothes
before
entering
the
cabin
i
stood
still
listening
in
the
lobby
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
faint
snore
came
through
the
closed
door
of
the
chief
mate
s
room
the
second
mate
s
door
was
on
the
hook
but
the
darkness
in
there
was
absolutely
soundless
he
too
was
young
and
could
sleep
like
a
stone
remained
the
steward
but
he
was
not
likely
to
wake
up
before
he
was
called
i
got
a
sleeping
suit
out
of
my
room
and
coming
back
on
deck
saw
the
naked
man
from
the
sea
sitting
on
the
main
hatch
glimmering
white
in
the
darkness
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
in
a
moment
he
had
concealed
his
damp
body
in
a
sleeping
suit
of
the
same
pattern
as
the
one
i
was
wearing
and
followed
me
like
my
double
on
the
poop
together
we
moved
right
aft
barefooted
silent
what
is
it
i
asked
in
a
deadened
voice
taking
the
lighted
lamp
out
of
the
binnacle
and
raising
it
to
his
face
an
ugly
he
had
rather
regular
features
a
good
mouth
light
eyes
under
somewhat
heavy
dark
eyebrows
a
smooth
square
forehead
no
growth
on
his
cheeks
a
small
brown
mustache
and
a
round
chin
his
expression
was
concentrated
meditative
under
the
inspecting
light
of
the
lamp
i
held
up
to
his
face
such
as
a
man
thinking
hard
in
solitude
might
wear
my
sleeping
suit
was
just
right
for
his
size
a
young
fellow
of
at
most
he
caught
his
lower
lip
with
the
edge
of
white
even
teeth
yes
i
said
replacing
the
lamp
in
the
binnacle
the
warm
heavy
tropical
night
closed
upon
his
head
again
there
s
a
ship
over
there
he
murmured
yes
i
know
the
sephora
did
you
know
of
us
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
i
am
the
mate
of
her
he
paused
and
corrected
himself
i
should
say
i
aha
something
wrong
yes
very
wrong
indeed
i
ve
killed
a
what
do
you
mean
just
now
no
on
the
passage
weeks
ago
south
when
i
say
a
man
fit
of
temper
i
suggested
confidently
the
shadowy
dark
head
like
mine
seemed
to
nod
imperceptibly
above
the
ghostly
gray
of
my
sleeping
suit
it
was
in
the
night
as
though
i
had
been
faced
by
my
own
reflection
in
the
depths
of
a
somber
and
immense
mirror
a
pretty
thing
to
have
to
own
up
to
for
a
conway
boy
murmured
my
double
distinctly
you
re
a
conway
boy
i
am
he
said
as
if
startled
then
slowly
perhaps
you
too
it
was
so
but
being
a
couple
of
years
older
i
had
left
before
he
joined
after
a
quick
interchange
of
dates
a
silence
fell
and
i
thought
suddenly
of
my
absurd
mate
with
his
terrific
whiskers
and
the
bless
my
soul
you
don
t
say
so
type
of
intellect
my
double
gave
me
an
inkling
of
his
thoughts
by
saying
my
father
s
a
parson
in
norfolk
do
you
see
me
before
a
judge
and
jury
on
that
charge
for
myself
i
can
t
see
the
necessity
there
are
fellows
that
an
angel
from
heaven
and
i
am
not
that
he
was
one
of
those
creatures
that
are
just
simmering
all
the
time
with
a
silly
sort
of
wickedness
miserable
devils
that
have
no
business
to
live
at
all
he
wouldn
t
do
his
duty
and
wouldn
t
let
anybody
else
do
theirs
but
what
s
the
good
of
talking
you
know
well
enough
the
sort
of
snarling
cur
he
appealed
to
me
as
if
our
experiences
had
been
as
identical
as
our
clothes
and
i
knew
well
enough
the
pestiferous
danger
of
such
a
character
where
there
are
no
means
of
legal
repression
and
i
knew
well
enough
also
that
my
double
there
was
no
homicidal
ruffian
i
did
not
think
of
asking
him
for
details
and
he
told
me
the
story
roughly
in
brusque
disconnected
sentences
i
needed
no
more
i
saw
it
all
going
on
as
though
i
were
myself
inside
that
other
sleeping
suit
it
happened
while
we
were
setting
a
reefed
foresail
at
dusk
reefed
foresail
you
understand
the
sort
of
weather
the
only
sail
we
had
left
to
keep
the
ship
running
so
you
may
guess
what
it
had
been
like
for
days
anxious
sort
of
job
that
he
gave
me
some
of
his
cursed
insolence
at
the
sheet
i
tell
you
i
was
overdone
with
this
terrific
weather
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
to
it
terrific
i
tell
you
and
a
deep
ship
i
believe
the
fellow
himself
was
half
crazed
with
funk
it
was
no
time
for
gentlemanly
reproof
so
i
turned
round
and
felled
him
like
an
ox
he
up
and
at
me
we
closed
just
as
an
awful
sea
made
for
the
ship
all
hands
saw
it
coming
and
took
to
the
rigging
but
i
had
him
by
the
throat
and
went
on
shaking
him
like
a
rat
the
men
above
us
yelling
look
out
look
out
then
a
crash
as
if
the
sky
had
fallen
on
my
head
they
say
that
for
over
ten
minutes
hardly
anything
was
to
be
seen
of
the
ship
just
the
three
masts
and
a
bit
of
the
forecastle
head
and
of
the
poop
all
awash
driving
along
in
a
smother
of
foam
it
was
a
miracle
that
they
found
us
jammed
together
behind
the
forebitts
it
s
clear
that
i
meant
business
because
i
was
holding
him
by
the
throat
still
when
they
picked
us
up
he
was
black
in
the
face
it
was
too
much
for
them
it
seems
they
rushed
us
aft
together
gripped
as
we
were
screaming
murder
like
a
lot
of
lunatics
and
broke
into
the
cuddy
and
the
ship
running
for
her
life
touch
and
go
all
the
time
any
minute
her
last
in
a
sea
fit
to
turn
your
hair
gray
only
at
it
i
understand
that
the
skipper
too
started
raving
like
the
rest
of
them
the
man
had
been
deprived
of
sleep
for
more
than
a
week
and
to
have
this
sprung
on
him
at
the
height
of
a
furious
gale
nearly
drove
him
out
of
his
mind
i
wonder
they
didn
t
fling
me
overboard
after
getting
the
carcass
of
their
precious
shipmate
out
of
my
fingers
they
had
rather
a
job
to
separate
us
i
ve
been
told
a
sufficiently
fierce
story
to
make
an
old
judge
and
a
respectable
jury
sit
up
a
bit
the
first
thing
i
heard
when
i
came
to
myself
was
the
maddening
howling
of
that
endless
gale
and
on
that
the
voice
of
the
old
man
he
was
hanging
on
to
my
bunk
staring
into
my
face
out
of
his
sou
wester
mr
leggatt
you
have
killed
a
man
you
can
act
no
longer
as
chief
mate
of
this
his
care
to
subdue
his
voice
made
it
sound
monotonous
he
rested
a
hand
on
the
end
of
the
skylight
to
steady
himself
with
and
all
that
time
did
not
stir
a
limb
so
far
as
i
could
see
nice
little
tale
for
a
quiet
tea
party
he
concluded
in
the
same
tone
one
of
my
hands
too
rested
on
the
end
of
the
skylight
neither
did
i
stir
a
limb
so
far
as
i
knew
we
stood
less
than
a
foot
from
each
other
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
old
bless
my
soul
you
don
t
say
so
were
to
put
his
head
up
the
companion
and
catch
sight
of
us
he
would
think
he
was
seeing
double
or
imagine
himself
come
upon
a
scene
of
weird
witchcraft
the
strange
captain
having
a
quiet
confabulation
by
the
wheel
with
his
own
gray
ghost
i
became
very
much
concerned
to
prevent
anything
of
the
sort
i
heard
the
other
s
soothing
undertone
my
father
s
a
parson
in
norfolk
it
said
evidently
he
had
forgotten
he
had
told
me
this
important
fact
before
truly
a
nice
little
tale
you
had
better
slip
down
into
my
stateroom
now
i
said
moving
off
stealthily
my
double
followed
my
movements
our
bare
feet
made
no
sound
i
let
him
in
closed
the
door
with
care
and
after
giving
a
call
to
the
second
mate
returned
on
deck
for
my
relief
not
much
sign
of
any
wind
yet
i
remarked
when
he
approached
no
sir
not
much
he
assented
sleepily
in
his
hoarse
voice
with
just
enough
deference
no
more
and
barely
suppressing
a
yawn
well
that
s
all
you
have
to
look
out
for
you
have
got
your
yes
i
paced
a
turn
or
two
on
the
poop
and
saw
him
take
up
his
position
face
forward
with
his
elbow
in
the
ratlines
of
the
mizzen
rigging
before
i
went
below
the
mate
s
faint
snoring
was
still
going
on
peacefully
the
cuddy
lamp
was
burning
over
the
table
on
which
stood
a
vase
with
flowers
a
polite
attention
from
the
ship
s
provision
merchant
the
last
flowers
we
should
see
for
the
next
three
months
at
the
very
least
two
bunches
of
bananas
hung
from
the
beam
symmetrically
one
on
each
side
of
the
rudder
casing
everything
was
as
before
in
the
ship
except
that
two
of
her
captain
s
sleeping
suits
were
simultaneously
in
use
one
motionless
in
the
cuddy
the
other
keeping
very
still
in
the
captain
s
stateroom
it
must
be
explained
here
that
my
cabin
had
the
form
of
the
capital
letter
l
the
door
being
within
the
angle
and
opening
into
the
short
part
of
the
letter
a
couch
was
to
the
left
the
bed
place
to
the
right
my
writing
desk
and
the
chronometers
table
faced
the
door
but
anyone
opening
it
unless
he
stepped
right
inside
had
no
view
of
what
i
call
the
long
or
vertical
part
of
the
letter
it
contained
some
lockers
surmounted
by
a
bookcase
and
a
few
clothes
a
thick
jacket
or
two
caps
oilskin
coat
and
such
like
hung
on
hooks
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
part
a
door
opening
into
my
bathroom
which
could
be
entered
also
directly
from
the
saloon
but
that
way
was
never
used
the
mysterious
arrival
had
discovered
the
advantage
of
this
particular
shape
entering
my
room
lighted
strongly
by
a
big
bulkhead
lamp
swung
on
gimbals
above
my
writing
desk
i
did
not
see
him
anywhere
till
he
stepped
out
quietly
from
behind
the
coats
hung
in
the
recessed
part
i
heard
somebody
moving
about
and
went
in
there
at
once
he
whispered
i
too
spoke
under
my
breath
nobody
is
likely
to
come
in
here
without
knocking
and
getting
he
nodded
his
face
was
thin
and
the
sunburn
faded
as
though
he
had
been
and
no
wonder
he
had
been
i
heard
presently
kept
under
arrest
in
his
cabin
for
nearly
seven
weeks
but
there
was
nothing
sickly
in
his
eyes
or
in
his
expression
he
was
not
a
bit
like
me
really
yet
as
we
stood
leaning
over
my
bed
place
whispering
side
by
side
with
our
dark
heads
together
and
our
backs
to
the
door
anybody
bold
enough
to
open
it
stealthily
would
have
been
treated
to
the
uncanny
sight
of
a
double
captain
busy
talking
in
whispers
with
his
other
self
but
all
this
doesn
t
tell
me
how
you
came
to
hang
on
to
our
side
ladder
i
inquired
in
the
hardly
audible
murmurs
we
used
after
he
had
told
me
something
more
of
the
proceedings
on
board
the
sephora
once
the
bad
weather
was
over
when
we
sighted
java
head
i
had
had
time
to
think
all
those
matters
out
several
times
over
i
had
six
weeks
of
doing
nothing
else
and
with
only
an
hour
or
so
every
evening
for
a
tramp
on
the
he
whispered
his
arms
folded
on
the
side
of
my
bed
place
staring
through
the
open
port
and
i
could
imagine
perfectly
the
manner
of
this
thinking
out
a
stubborn
if
not
a
steadfast
operation
something
of
which
i
should
have
been
perfectly
incapable
i
reckoned
it
would
be
dark
before
we
closed
with
the
land
he
continued
so
low
that
i
had
to
strain
my
hearing
near
as
we
were
to
each
other
shoulder
touching
shoulder
almost
so
i
asked
to
speak
to
the
old
man
he
always
seemed
very
sick
when
he
came
to
see
me
as
if
he
could
not
look
me
in
the
face
you
know
that
foresail
saved
the
ship
she
was
too
deep
to
have
run
long
under
bare
poles
and
it
was
i
that
managed
to
set
it
for
him
anyway
he
came
when
i
had
him
in
my
cabin
he
stood
by
the
door
looking
at
me
as
if
i
had
the
halter
round
my
neck
already
i
asked
him
right
away
to
leave
my
cabin
door
unlocked
at
night
while
the
ship
was
going
through
sunda
straits
there
would
be
the
java
coast
within
two
or
three
miles
off
angier
point
i
wanted
nothing
more
i
ve
had
a
prize
for
swimming
my
second
year
in
the
i
can
believe
it
i
breathed
out
god
only
knows
why
they
locked
me
in
every
night
to
see
some
of
their
faces
you
d
have
thought
they
were
afraid
i
d
go
about
at
night
strangling
people
am
i
a
murdering
brute
do
i
look
it
by
jove
if
i
had
been
he
wouldn
t
have
trusted
himself
like
that
into
my
room
you
ll
say
i
might
have
chucked
him
aside
and
bolted
out
there
and
then
it
was
dark
already
well
no
and
for
the
same
reason
i
wouldn
t
think
of
trying
to
smash
the
door
there
would
have
been
a
rush
to
stop
me
at
the
noise
and
i
did
not
mean
to
get
into
a
confounded
scrimmage
somebody
else
might
have
got
killed
for
i
would
not
have
broken
out
only
to
get
chucked
back
and
i
did
not
want
any
more
of
that
work
he
refused
looking
more
sick
than
ever
he
was
afraid
of
the
men
and
also
of
that
old
second
mate
of
his
who
had
been
sailing
with
him
for
years
a
old
humbug
and
his
steward
too
had
been
with
him
devil
knows
how
long
seventeen
years
or
more
a
dogmatic
sort
of
loafer
who
hated
me
like
poison
just
because
i
was
the
chief
mate
no
chief
mate
ever
made
more
than
one
voyage
in
the
sephora
you
know
those
two
old
chaps
ran
the
ship
devil
only
knows
what
the
skipper
wasn
t
afraid
of
all
his
nerve
went
to
pieces
altogether
in
that
hellish
spell
of
bad
weather
we
had
of
what
the
law
would
do
to
him
of
his
wife
perhaps
oh
yes
she
s
on
board
though
i
don
t
think
she
would
have
meddled
she
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
have
me
out
of
the
ship
in
any
way
the
brand
of
cain
business
don
t
you
see
that
s
all
right
i
was
ready
enough
to
go
off
wandering
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
was
price
enough
to
pay
for
an
abel
of
that
sort
anyhow
he
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
this
thing
must
take
its
course
i
represent
the
law
he
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
so
you
won
t
no
then
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
sleep
on
that
i
said
and
turned
my
back
on
him
i
wonder
that
you
can
cries
he
and
locks
the
door
well
after
that
i
couldn
t
not
very
well
that
was
three
weeks
ago
we
have
had
a
slow
passage
through
the
java
sea
drifted
about
carimata
for
ten
days
when
we
anchored
here
they
thought
i
suppose
it
was
all
right
the
nearest
land
and
that
s
five
miles
is
the
ship
s
destination
the
consul
would
soon
set
about
catching
me
and
there
would
have
been
no
object
in
holding
to
these
islets
there
i
don
t
suppose
there
s
a
drop
of
water
on
them
i
don
t
know
how
it
was
but
tonight
that
steward
after
bringing
me
my
supper
went
out
to
let
me
eat
it
and
left
the
door
unlocked
and
i
ate
it
all
there
was
too
after
i
had
finished
i
strolled
out
on
the
i
don
t
know
that
i
meant
to
do
anything
a
breath
of
fresh
air
was
all
i
wanted
i
believe
then
a
sudden
temptation
came
over
me
i
kicked
off
my
slippers
and
was
in
the
water
before
i
had
made
up
my
mind
fairly
somebody
heard
the
splash
and
they
raised
an
awful
hullabaloo
he
s
gone
lower
the
boats
he
s
committed
suicide
no
he
s
certainly
i
was
swimming
it
s
not
so
easy
for
a
swimmer
like
me
to
commit
suicide
by
drowning
i
landed
on
the
nearest
islet
before
the
boat
left
the
ship
s
side
i
heard
them
pulling
about
in
the
dark
hailing
and
so
on
but
after
a
bit
they
gave
up
everything
quieted
down
and
the
anchorage
became
still
as
death
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
began
to
think
i
felt
certain
they
would
start
searching
for
me
at
daylight
there
was
no
place
to
hide
on
those
stony
things
and
if
there
had
been
what
would
have
been
the
good
but
now
i
was
clear
of
that
ship
i
was
not
going
back
so
after
a
while
i
took
off
all
my
clothes
tied
them
up
in
a
bundle
with
a
stone
inside
and
dropped
them
in
the
deep
water
on
the
outer
side
of
that
islet
that
was
suicide
enough
for
me
let
them
think
what
they
liked
but
i
didn
t
mean
to
drown
myself
i
meant
to
swim
till
i
sank
but
that
s
not
the
same
thing
i
struck
out
for
another
of
these
little
islands
and
it
was
from
that
one
that
i
first
saw
your
riding
light
something
to
swim
for
i
went
on
easily
and
on
the
way
i
came
upon
a
flat
rock
a
foot
or
two
above
water
in
the
daytime
i
dare
say
you
might
make
it
out
with
a
glass
from
your
poop
i
scrambled
up
on
it
and
rested
myself
for
a
bit
then
i
made
another
start
that
last
spell
must
have
been
over
a
his
whisper
was
getting
fainter
and
fainter
and
all
the
time
he
stared
straight
out
through
the
porthole
in
which
there
was
not
even
a
star
to
be
seen
i
had
not
interrupted
him
there
was
something
that
made
comment
impossible
in
his
narrative
or
perhaps
in
himself
a
sort
of
feeling
a
quality
which
i
can
t
find
a
name
for
and
when
he
ceased
all
i
found
was
a
futile
whisper
so
you
swam
for
our
light
yes
straight
for
it
it
was
something
to
swim
for
i
couldn
t
see
any
stars
low
down
because
the
coast
was
in
the
way
and
i
couldn
t
see
the
land
either
the
water
was
like
glass
one
might
have
been
swimming
in
a
confounded
deep
cistern
with
no
place
for
scrambling
out
anywhere
but
what
i
didn
t
like
was
the
notion
of
swimming
round
and
round
like
a
crazed
bullock
before
i
gave
out
and
as
i
didn
t
mean
to
go
back
no
do
you
see
me
being
hauled
back
stark
naked
off
one
of
these
little
islands
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
fighting
like
a
wild
beast
somebody
would
have
got
killed
for
certain
and
i
did
not
want
any
of
that
so
i
went
on
then
your
ladder
why
didn
t
you
hail
the
ship
i
asked
a
little
louder
he
touched
my
shoulder
lightly
lazy
footsteps
came
right
over
our
heads
and
stopped
the
second
mate
had
crossed
from
the
other
side
of
the
poop
and
might
have
been
hanging
over
the
rail
for
all
we
knew
he
couldn
t
hear
us
talking
could
he
my
double
breathed
into
my
very
ear
anxiously
his
anxiety
was
in
answer
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
question
i
had
put
to
him
an
answer
containing
all
the
difficulty
of
that
situation
i
closed
the
porthole
quietly
to
make
sure
a
louder
word
might
have
been
overheard
who
s
that
he
whispered
then
my
second
mate
but
i
don
t
know
much
more
of
the
fellow
than
you
and
i
told
him
a
little
about
myself
i
had
been
appointed
to
take
charge
while
i
least
expected
anything
of
the
sort
not
quite
a
fortnight
ago
i
didn
t
know
either
the
ship
or
the
people
hadn
t
had
the
time
in
port
to
look
about
me
or
size
anybody
up
and
as
to
the
crew
all
they
knew
was
that
i
was
appointed
to
take
the
ship
home
for
the
rest
i
was
almost
as
much
of
a
stranger
on
board
as
himself
i
said
and
at
the
moment
i
felt
it
most
acutely
i
felt
that
it
would
take
very
little
to
make
me
a
suspect
person
in
the
eyes
of
the
ship
s
company
he
had
turned
about
meantime
and
we
the
two
strangers
in
the
ship
faced
each
other
in
identical
attitudes
your
ladder
he
murmured
after
a
silence
who
d
have
thought
of
finding
a
ladder
hanging
over
at
night
in
a
ship
anchored
out
here
i
felt
just
then
a
very
unpleasant
faintness
after
the
life
i
ve
been
leading
for
nine
weeks
anybody
would
have
got
out
of
condition
i
wasn
t
capable
of
swimming
round
as
far
as
your
rudder
chains
and
lo
and
behold
there
was
a
ladder
to
get
hold
of
after
i
gripped
it
i
said
to
myself
what
s
the
good
when
i
saw
a
man
s
head
looking
over
i
thought
i
would
swim
away
presently
and
leave
him
shouting
in
whatever
language
it
was
i
didn
t
mind
being
looked
at
i
i
liked
it
and
then
you
speaking
to
me
so
quietly
as
if
you
had
expected
me
made
me
hold
on
a
little
longer
it
had
been
a
confounded
lonely
time
i
don
t
mean
while
swimming
i
was
glad
to
talk
a
little
to
somebody
that
didn
t
belong
to
the
sephora
as
to
asking
for
the
captain
that
was
a
mere
impulse
it
could
have
been
no
use
with
all
the
ship
knowing
about
me
and
the
other
people
pretty
certain
to
be
round
here
in
the
morning
i
don
t
know
i
wanted
to
be
seen
to
talk
with
somebody
before
i
went
on
i
don
t
know
what
i
would
have
said
fine
night
isn
t
it
or
something
of
the
do
you
think
they
will
be
round
here
presently
i
asked
with
some
incredulity
quite
likely
he
said
faintly
he
looked
extremely
haggard
all
of
a
sudden
his
head
rolled
on
his
shoulders
h
m
we
shall
see
then
meantime
get
into
that
bed
i
whispered
want
help
it
was
a
rather
high
bed
place
with
a
set
of
drawers
underneath
this
amazing
swimmer
really
needed
the
lift
i
gave
him
by
seizing
his
leg
he
tumbled
in
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
flung
one
arm
across
his
eyes
and
then
with
his
face
nearly
hidden
he
must
have
looked
exactly
as
i
used
to
look
in
that
bed
i
gazed
upon
my
other
self
for
a
while
before
drawing
across
carefully
the
two
green
serge
curtains
which
ran
on
a
brass
rod
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
pinning
them
together
for
greater
safety
but
i
sat
down
on
the
couch
and
once
there
i
felt
unwilling
to
rise
and
hunt
for
a
pin
i
would
do
it
in
a
moment
i
was
extremely
tired
in
a
peculiarly
intimate
way
by
the
strain
of
stealthiness
by
the
effort
of
whispering
and
the
general
secrecy
of
this
excitement
it
was
three
o
clock
by
now
and
i
had
been
on
my
feet
since
nine
but
i
was
not
sleepy
i
could
not
have
gone
to
sleep
i
sat
there
fagged
out
looking
at
the
curtains
trying
to
clear
my
mind
of
the
confused
sensation
of
being
in
two
places
at
once
and
greatly
bothered
by
an
exasperating
knocking
in
my
head
it
was
a
relief
to
discover
suddenly
that
it
was
not
in
my
head
at
all
but
on
the
outside
of
the
door
before
i
could
collect
myself
the
words
come
in
were
out
of
my
mouth
and
the
steward
entered
with
a
tray
bringing
in
my
morning
coffee
i
had
slept
after
all
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
shouted
this
way
i
am
here
steward
as
though
he
had
been
miles
away
he
put
down
the
tray
on
the
table
next
the
couch
and
only
then
said
very
quietly
i
can
see
you
are
here
i
felt
him
give
me
a
keen
look
but
i
dared
not
meet
his
eyes
just
then
he
must
have
wondered
why
i
had
drawn
the
curtains
of
my
bed
before
going
to
sleep
on
the
couch
he
went
out
hooking
the
door
open
as
usual
i
heard
the
crew
washing
decks
above
me
i
knew
i
would
have
been
told
at
once
if
there
had
been
any
wind
calm
i
thought
and
i
was
doubly
vexed
indeed
i
felt
dual
more
than
ever
the
steward
reappeared
suddenly
in
the
doorway
i
jumped
up
from
the
couch
so
quickly
that
he
gave
a
start
what
do
you
want
here
close
your
port
sir
they
are
washing
it
is
closed
i
said
reddening
very
well
but
he
did
not
move
from
the
doorway
and
returned
my
stare
in
an
extraordinary
equivocal
manner
for
a
time
then
his
eyes
wavered
all
his
expression
changed
and
in
a
voice
unusually
gentle
almost
coaxingly
may
i
come
in
to
take
the
empty
cup
away
sir
of
course
i
turned
my
back
on
him
while
he
popped
in
and
out
then
i
unhooked
and
closed
the
door
and
even
pushed
the
bolt
this
sort
of
thing
could
not
go
on
very
long
the
cabin
was
as
hot
as
an
oven
too
i
took
a
peep
at
my
double
and
discovered
that
he
had
not
moved
his
arm
was
still
over
his
eyes
but
his
chest
heaved
his
hair
was
wet
his
chin
glistened
with
perspiration
i
reached
over
him
and
opened
the
port
i
must
show
myself
on
deck
i
reflected
of
course
theoretically
i
could
do
what
i
liked
with
no
one
to
say
nay
to
me
within
the
whole
circle
of
the
horizon
but
to
lock
my
cabin
door
and
take
the
key
away
i
did
not
dare
directly
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
companion
i
saw
the
group
of
my
two
officers
the
second
mate
barefooted
the
chief
mate
in
long
boots
near
the
break
of
the
poop
and
the
steward
halfway
down
the
poop
ladder
talking
to
them
eagerly
he
happened
to
catch
sight
of
me
and
dived
the
second
ran
down
on
the
shouting
some
order
or
other
and
the
chief
mate
came
to
meet
me
touching
his
cap
there
was
a
sort
of
curiosity
in
his
eye
that
i
did
not
like
i
don
t
know
whether
the
steward
had
told
them
that
i
was
queer
only
or
downright
drunk
but
i
know
the
man
meant
to
have
a
good
look
at
me
i
watched
him
coming
with
a
smile
which
as
he
got
into
range
took
effect
and
froze
his
very
whiskers
i
did
not
give
him
time
to
open
his
lips
square
the
yards
by
lifts
and
braces
before
the
hands
go
to
it
was
the
first
particular
order
i
had
given
on
board
that
ship
and
i
stayed
on
deck
to
see
it
executed
too
i
had
felt
the
need
of
asserting
myself
without
loss
of
time
that
sneering
young
cub
got
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
on
that
occasion
and
i
also
seized
the
opportunity
of
having
a
good
look
at
the
face
of
every
foremast
man
as
they
filed
past
me
to
go
to
the
after
braces
at
breakfast
time
eating
nothing
myself
i
presided
with
such
frigid
dignity
that
the
two
mates
were
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
the
cabin
as
soon
as
decency
permitted
and
all
the
time
the
dual
working
of
my
mind
distracted
me
almost
to
the
point
of
insanity
i
was
constantly
watching
myself
my
secret
self
as
dependent
on
my
actions
as
my
own
personality
sleeping
in
that
bed
behind
that
door
which
faced
me
as
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
it
was
very
much
like
being
mad
only
it
was
worse
because
one
was
aware
of
it
i
had
to
shake
him
for
a
solid
minute
but
when
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
in
the
full
possession
of
his
senses
with
an
inquiring
look
all
s
well
so
far
i
whispered
now
you
must
vanish
into
the
he
did
so
as
noiseless
as
a
ghost
and
then
i
rang
for
the
steward
and
facing
him
boldly
directed
him
to
tidy
up
my
stateroom
while
i
was
having
my
bath
and
be
quick
about
as
my
tone
admitted
of
no
excuses
he
said
yes
sir
and
ran
off
to
fetch
his
dustpan
and
brushes
i
took
a
bath
and
did
most
of
my
dressing
splashing
and
whistling
softly
for
the
steward
s
edification
while
the
secret
sharer
of
my
life
stood
drawn
up
bolt
upright
in
that
little
space
his
face
looking
very
sunken
in
daylight
his
eyelids
lowered
under
the
stern
dark
line
of
his
eyebrows
drawn
together
by
a
slight
frown
when
i
left
him
there
to
go
back
to
my
room
the
steward
was
finishing
dusting
i
sent
for
the
mate
and
engaged
him
in
some
insignificant
conversation
it
was
as
it
were
trifling
with
the
terrific
character
of
his
whiskers
but
my
object
was
to
give
him
an
opportunity
for
a
good
look
at
my
cabin
and
then
i
could
at
last
shut
with
a
clear
conscience
the
door
of
my
stateroom
and
get
my
double
back
into
the
recessed
part
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
he
had
to
sit
still
on
a
small
folding
stool
half
smothered
by
the
heavy
coats
hanging
there
we
listened
to
the
steward
going
into
the
bathroom
out
of
the
saloon
filling
the
water
bottles
there
scrubbing
the
bath
setting
things
to
rights
whisk
bang
clatter
out
again
into
the
saloon
turn
the
key
click
such
was
my
scheme
for
keeping
my
second
self
invisible
nothing
better
could
be
contrived
under
the
circumstances
and
there
we
sat
i
at
my
writing
desk
ready
to
appear
busy
with
some
papers
he
behind
me
out
of
sight
of
the
door
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
talk
in
daytime
and
i
could
not
have
stood
the
excitement
of
that
queer
sense
of
whispering
to
myself
now
and
then
glancing
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
him
far
back
there
sitting
rigidly
on
the
low
stool
his
bare
feet
close
together
his
arms
folded
his
head
hanging
on
his
breast
and
perfectly
still
anybody
would
have
taken
him
for
me
i
was
fascinated
by
it
myself
every
moment
i
had
to
glance
over
my
shoulder
i
was
looking
at
him
when
a
voice
outside
the
door
said
beg
pardon
well
i
kept
my
eyes
on
him
and
so
when
the
voice
outside
the
door
announced
there
s
a
ship
s
boat
coming
our
way
sir
i
saw
him
give
a
start
the
first
movement
he
had
made
for
hours
but
he
did
not
raise
his
bowed
head
all
right
get
the
ladder
i
hesitated
should
i
whisper
something
to
him
but
what
his
immobility
seemed
to
have
been
never
disturbed
what
could
i
tell
him
he
did
not
know
already
finally
i
went
on
deck
ii
the
skipper
of
the
sephora
had
a
thin
red
whisker
all
round
his
face
and
the
sort
of
complexion
that
goes
with
hair
of
that
color
also
the
particular
rather
smeary
shade
of
blue
in
the
eyes
he
was
not
exactly
a
showy
figure
his
shoulders
were
high
his
stature
but
middling
one
leg
slightly
more
bandy
than
the
other
he
shook
hands
looking
vaguely
around
a
spiritless
tenacity
was
his
main
characteristic
i
judged
i
behaved
with
a
politeness
which
seemed
to
disconcert
him
perhaps
he
was
shy
he
mumbled
to
me
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
what
he
was
saying
gave
his
name
it
was
something
like
archbold
but
at
this
distance
of
years
i
hardly
am
sure
his
ship
s
name
and
a
few
other
particulars
of
that
sort
in
the
manner
of
a
criminal
making
a
reluctant
and
doleful
confession
he
had
had
terrible
weather
on
the
passage
out
terrible
terrible
wife
aboard
too
by
this
time
we
were
seated
in
the
cabin
and
the
steward
brought
in
a
tray
with
a
bottle
and
glasses
thanks
never
took
liquor
would
have
some
water
though
he
drank
two
tumblerfuls
terrible
thirsty
work
ever
since
daylight
had
been
exploring
the
islands
round
his
ship
what
was
that
for
fun
i
asked
with
an
appearance
of
polite
interest
no
he
sighed
painful
as
he
persisted
in
his
mumbling
and
i
wanted
my
double
to
hear
every
word
i
hit
upon
the
notion
of
informing
him
that
i
regretted
to
say
i
was
hard
of
hearing
such
a
young
man
too
he
nodded
keeping
his
smeary
blue
unintelligent
eyes
fastened
upon
me
what
was
the
cause
of
it
some
disease
he
inquired
without
the
least
sympathy
and
as
if
he
thought
that
if
so
i
d
got
no
more
than
i
deserved
yes
disease
i
admitted
in
a
cheerful
tone
which
seemed
to
shock
him
but
my
point
was
gained
because
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
to
give
me
his
tale
it
is
not
worth
while
to
record
his
version
it
was
just
over
two
months
since
all
this
had
happened
and
he
had
thought
so
much
about
it
that
he
seemed
completely
muddled
as
to
its
bearings
but
still
immensely
impressed
what
would
you
think
of
such
a
thing
happening
on
board
your
own
ship
i
ve
had
the
sephora
for
these
fifteen
years
i
am
a
he
was
densely
distressed
and
perhaps
i
should
have
sympathized
with
him
if
i
had
been
able
to
detach
my
mental
vision
from
the
unsuspected
sharer
of
my
cabin
as
though
he
were
my
second
self
there
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
bulkhead
four
or
five
feet
from
us
no
more
as
we
sat
in
the
saloon
i
looked
politely
at
captain
archbold
if
that
was
his
name
but
it
was
the
other
i
saw
in
a
gray
sleeping
suit
seated
on
a
low
stool
his
bare
feet
close
together
his
arms
folded
and
every
word
said
between
us
falling
into
the
ears
of
his
dark
head
bowed
on
his
chest
i
have
been
at
sea
now
man
and
boy
for
years
and
i
ve
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
happening
in
an
english
ship
and
that
it
should
be
my
ship
wife
on
board
i
was
hardly
listening
to
him
don
t
you
think
i
said
that
the
heavy
sea
which
you
told
me
came
aboard
just
then
might
have
killed
the
man
i
have
seen
the
sheer
weight
of
a
sea
kill
a
man
very
neatly
by
simply
breaking
his
good
god
he
uttered
impressively
fixing
his
smeary
blue
eyes
on
me
the
sea
no
man
killed
by
the
sea
ever
looked
like
he
seemed
positively
scandalized
at
my
suggestion
and
as
i
gazed
at
him
certainly
not
prepared
for
anything
original
on
his
part
he
advanced
his
head
close
to
mine
and
thrust
his
tongue
out
at
me
so
suddenly
that
i
couldn
t
help
starting
back
after
scoring
over
my
calmness
in
this
graphic
way
he
nodded
wisely
if
i
had
seen
the
sight
he
assured
me
i
would
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
lived
the
weather
was
too
bad
to
give
the
corpse
a
proper
sea
burial
so
next
day
at
dawn
they
took
it
up
on
the
poop
covering
its
face
with
a
bit
of
bunting
he
read
a
short
prayer
and
then
just
as
it
was
in
its
oilskins
and
long
boots
they
launched
it
amongst
those
mountainous
seas
that
seemed
ready
every
moment
to
swallow
up
the
ship
herself
and
the
terrified
lives
on
board
of
her
that
reefed
foresail
saved
you
i
threw
in
under
god
it
did
he
exclaimed
fervently
it
was
by
a
special
mercy
i
firmly
believe
that
it
stood
some
of
those
hurricane
it
was
the
setting
of
that
sail
which
i
began
god
s
own
hand
in
it
he
interrupted
me
nothing
less
could
have
done
it
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
i
hardly
dared
give
the
order
it
seemed
impossible
that
we
could
touch
anything
without
losing
it
and
then
our
last
hope
would
have
been
the
terror
of
that
gale
was
on
him
yet
i
let
him
go
on
for
a
bit
then
said
casually
as
if
returning
to
a
minor
subject
you
were
very
anxious
to
give
up
your
mate
to
the
shore
people
i
believe
he
was
to
the
law
his
obscure
tenacity
on
that
point
had
in
it
something
incomprehensible
and
a
little
awful
something
as
it
were
mystical
quite
apart
from
his
anxiety
that
he
should
not
be
suspected
of
countenancing
any
doings
of
that
virtuous
years
at
sea
of
which
over
twenty
of
immaculate
command
and
the
last
fifteen
in
the
sephora
seemed
to
have
laid
him
under
some
pitiless
obligation
and
you
know
he
went
on
groping
amongst
his
feelings
i
did
not
engage
that
young
fellow
his
people
had
some
interest
with
my
owners
i
was
in
a
way
forced
to
take
him
on
he
looked
very
smart
very
gentlemanly
and
all
that
but
do
you
know
i
never
liked
him
somehow
i
am
a
plain
man
you
see
he
wasn
t
exactly
the
sort
for
the
chief
mate
of
a
ship
like
the
i
had
become
so
connected
in
thoughts
and
impressions
with
the
secret
sharer
of
my
cabin
that
i
felt
as
if
i
personally
were
being
given
to
understand
that
i
too
was
not
the
sort
that
would
have
done
for
the
chief
mate
of
a
ship
like
the
sephora
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
in
my
mind
not
at
all
the
style
of
man
you
understand
he
insisted
superfluously
looking
hard
at
me
i
smiled
urbanely
he
seemed
at
a
loss
for
a
while
i
suppose
i
must
report
a
beg
pardon
suicide
that
s
what
i
ll
have
to
write
to
my
owners
directly
i
get
unless
you
manage
to
recover
him
before
tomorrow
i
assented
dispassionately
i
mean
he
mumbled
something
which
i
really
did
not
catch
and
i
turned
my
ear
to
him
in
a
puzzled
manner
he
fairly
bawled
the
land
i
say
the
mainland
is
at
least
seven
miles
off
my
about
my
lack
of
excitement
of
curiosity
of
surprise
of
any
sort
of
pronounced
interest
began
to
arouse
his
distrust
but
except
for
the
felicitous
pretense
of
deafness
i
had
not
tried
to
pretend
anything
i
had
felt
utterly
incapable
of
playing
the
part
of
ignorance
properly
and
therefore
was
afraid
to
try
it
is
also
certain
that
he
had
brought
some
suspicions
with
him
and
that
he
viewed
my
politeness
as
a
strange
and
unnatural
phenomenon
and
yet
how
else
could
i
have
received
him
not
heartily
that
was
impossible
for
psychological
reasons
which
i
need
not
state
here
my
only
object
was
to
keep
off
his
inquiries
surlily
yes
but
surliness
might
have
provoked
a
question
from
its
novelty
to
him
and
from
its
nature
punctilious
courtesy
was
the
manner
best
calculated
to
restrain
the
man
but
there
was
the
danger
of
his
breaking
through
my
defense
bluntly
i
could
not
i
think
have
met
him
by
a
direct
lie
also
for
psychological
not
moral
reasons
if
he
had
only
known
how
afraid
i
was
of
his
putting
my
feeling
of
identity
with
the
other
to
the
test
but
strangely
enough
i
thought
of
it
only
afterwards
i
believe
that
he
was
not
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
reverse
side
of
that
weird
situation
by
something
in
me
that
reminded
him
of
the
man
he
was
seeking
suggested
a
mysterious
similitude
to
the
young
fellow
he
had
distrusted
and
disliked
from
the
first
however
that
might
have
been
the
silence
was
not
very
prolonged
he
took
another
oblique
step
i
reckon
i
had
no
more
than
a
pull
to
your
ship
not
a
bit
and
quite
enough
too
in
this
awful
heat
i
said
another
pause
full
of
mistrust
followed
necessity
they
say
is
mother
of
invention
but
fear
too
is
not
barren
of
ingenious
suggestions
and
i
was
afraid
he
would
ask
me
for
news
of
my
other
self
nice
little
saloon
isn
t
it
i
remarked
as
if
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
way
his
eyes
roamed
from
one
closed
door
to
the
other
and
very
well
fitted
out
too
here
for
instance
i
continued
reaching
over
the
back
of
my
seat
negligently
and
flinging
the
door
open
is
my
he
made
an
eager
movement
but
hardly
gave
it
a
glance
i
got
up
shut
the
door
of
the
bathroom
and
invited
him
to
have
a
look
round
as
if
i
were
very
proud
of
my
accommodation
he
had
to
rise
and
be
shown
round
but
he
went
through
the
business
without
any
raptures
whatever
and
now
we
ll
have
a
look
at
my
stateroom
i
declared
in
a
voice
as
loud
as
i
dared
to
make
it
crossing
the
cabin
to
the
starboard
side
with
purposely
heavy
steps
he
followed
me
in
and
gazed
around
my
intelligent
double
had
vanished
i
played
my
part
very
convenient
isn
t
it
very
nice
very
comf
he
didn
t
finish
and
went
out
brusquely
as
if
to
escape
from
some
unrighteous
wiles
of
mine
but
it
was
not
to
be
i
had
been
too
frightened
not
to
feel
vengeful
i
felt
i
had
him
on
the
run
and
i
meant
to
keep
him
on
the
run
my
polite
insistence
must
have
had
something
menacing
in
it
because
he
gave
in
suddenly
and
i
did
not
let
him
off
a
single
item
mate
s
room
pantry
storerooms
the
very
sail
locker
which
was
also
under
the
poop
he
had
to
look
into
them
all
when
at
last
i
showed
him
out
on
the
he
drew
a
long
spiritless
sigh
and
mumbled
dismally
that
he
must
really
be
going
back
to
his
ship
now
i
desired
my
mate
who
had
joined
us
to
see
to
the
captain
s
boat
the
man
of
whiskers
gave
a
blast
on
the
whistle
which
he
used
to
wear
hanging
round
his
neck
and
yelled
sephora
s
away
my
double
down
there
in
my
cabin
must
have
heard
and
certainly
could
not
feel
more
relieved
than
i
four
fellows
came
running
out
from
somewhere
forward
and
went
over
the
side
while
my
own
men
appearing
on
deck
too
lined
the
rail
i
escorted
my
visitor
to
the
gangway
ceremoniously
and
nearly
overdid
it
he
was
a
tenacious
beast
on
the
very
ladder
he
lingered
and
in
that
unique
guiltily
conscientious
manner
of
sticking
to
the
point
i
say
you
you
don
t
think
that
i
covered
his
voice
loudly
certainly
not
i
am
delighted
i
had
an
idea
of
what
he
meant
to
say
and
just
saved
myself
by
the
privilege
of
defective
hearing
he
was
too
shaken
generally
to
insist
but
my
mate
close
witness
of
that
parting
looked
mystified
and
his
face
took
on
a
thoughtful
cast
as
i
did
not
want
to
appear
as
if
i
wished
to
avoid
all
communication
with
my
officers
he
had
the
opportunity
to
address
me
seems
a
very
nice
man
his
boat
s
crew
told
our
chaps
a
very
extraordinary
story
if
what
i
am
told
by
the
steward
is
true
i
suppose
you
had
it
from
the
captain
sir
yes
i
had
a
story
from
the
a
very
horrible
affair
isn
t
it
sir
it
beats
all
these
tales
we
hear
about
murders
in
yankee
i
don
t
think
it
beats
them
i
don
t
think
it
resembles
them
in
the
bless
my
soul
you
don
t
say
so
but
of
course
i
ve
no
acquaintance
whatever
with
american
ships
not
i
so
i
couldn
t
go
against
your
knowledge
it
s
horrible
enough
for
me
but
the
queerest
part
is
that
those
fellows
seemed
to
have
some
idea
the
man
was
hidden
aboard
here
they
had
really
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
preposterous
isn
t
it
we
were
walking
to
and
fro
athwart
the
no
one
of
the
crew
forward
could
be
seen
the
day
was
sunday
and
the
mate
pursued
there
was
some
little
dispute
about
it
our
chaps
took
offense
as
if
we
would
harbor
a
thing
like
that
they
said
wouldn
t
you
like
to
look
for
him
in
our
quite
a
tiff
but
they
made
it
up
in
the
end
i
suppose
he
did
drown
himself
don
t
you
sir
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
no
doubt
in
the
matter
sir
none
i
left
him
suddenly
i
felt
i
was
producing
a
bad
impression
but
with
my
double
down
there
it
was
most
trying
to
be
on
deck
and
it
was
almost
as
trying
to
be
below
altogether
a
situation
but
on
the
whole
i
felt
less
torn
in
two
when
i
was
with
him
there
was
no
one
in
the
whole
ship
whom
i
dared
take
into
my
confidence
since
the
hands
had
got
to
know
his
story
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
pass
him
off
for
anyone
else
and
an
accidental
discovery
was
to
be
dreaded
now
more
than
ever
the
steward
being
engaged
in
laying
the
table
for
dinner
we
could
talk
only
with
our
eyes
when
i
first
went
down
later
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
cautious
try
at
whispering
the
sunday
quietness
of
the
ship
was
against
us
the
stillness
of
air
and
water
around
her
was
against
us
the
elements
the
men
were
against
us
everything
was
against
us
in
our
secret
partnership
time
itself
for
this
could
not
go
on
forever
the
very
trust
in
providence
was
i
suppose
denied
to
his
guilt
shall
i
confess
that
this
thought
cast
me
down
very
much
and
as
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
which
counts
for
so
much
in
the
book
of
success
i
could
only
hope
that
it
was
closed
for
what
favorable
accident
could
be
expected
did
you
hear
everything
were
my
first
words
as
soon
as
we
took
up
our
position
side
by
side
leaning
over
my
bed
place
he
had
and
the
proof
of
it
was
his
earnest
whisper
the
man
told
you
he
hardly
dared
to
give
the
i
understood
the
reference
to
be
to
that
saving
foresail
yes
he
was
afraid
of
it
being
lost
in
the
i
assure
you
he
never
gave
the
order
he
may
think
he
did
but
he
never
gave
it
he
stood
there
with
me
on
the
break
of
the
poop
after
the
main
topsail
blew
away
and
whimpered
about
our
last
hope
positively
whimpered
about
it
and
nothing
else
and
the
night
coming
on
to
hear
one
s
skipper
go
on
like
that
in
such
weather
was
enough
to
drive
any
fellow
out
of
his
mind
it
worked
me
up
into
a
sort
of
desperation
i
just
took
it
into
my
own
hands
and
went
away
from
him
boiling
and
but
what
s
the
use
telling
you
know
do
you
think
that
if
i
had
not
been
pretty
fierce
with
them
i
should
have
got
the
men
to
do
anything
not
i
the
bo
s
n
perhaps
perhaps
it
wasn
t
a
heavy
sea
it
was
a
sea
gone
mad
i
suppose
the
end
of
the
world
will
be
something
like
that
and
a
man
may
have
the
heart
to
see
it
coming
once
and
be
done
with
it
but
to
have
to
face
it
day
after
day
i
don
t
blame
anybody
i
was
precious
little
better
than
the
rest
only
i
was
an
officer
of
that
old
coal
wagon
anyhow
i
quite
understand
i
conveyed
that
sincere
assurance
into
his
ear
he
was
out
of
breath
with
whispering
i
could
hear
him
pant
slightly
it
was
all
very
simple
the
same
force
which
had
given
men
a
chance
at
least
for
their
lives
had
in
a
sort
of
recoil
crushed
an
unworthy
mutinous
existence
but
i
had
no
leisure
to
weigh
the
merits
of
the
matter
footsteps
in
the
saloon
a
heavy
knock
there
s
enough
wind
to
get
under
way
with
here
was
the
call
of
a
new
claim
upon
my
thoughts
and
even
upon
my
feelings
turn
the
hands
up
i
cried
through
the
door
i
ll
be
on
deck
i
was
going
out
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
ship
before
i
left
the
cabin
our
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
only
two
strangers
on
board
i
pointed
to
the
recessed
part
where
the
little
campstool
awaited
him
and
laid
my
finger
on
my
lips
he
made
a
gesture
somewhat
vague
a
little
mysterious
accompanied
by
a
faint
smile
as
if
of
regret
this
is
not
the
place
to
enlarge
upon
the
sensations
of
a
man
who
feels
for
the
first
time
a
ship
move
under
his
feet
to
his
own
independent
word
in
my
case
they
were
not
unalloyed
i
was
not
wholly
alone
with
my
command
for
there
was
that
stranger
in
my
cabin
or
rather
i
was
not
completely
and
wholly
with
her
part
of
me
was
absent
that
mental
feeling
of
being
in
two
places
at
once
affected
me
physically
as
if
the
mood
of
secrecy
had
penetrated
my
very
soul
before
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
the
ship
had
begun
to
move
having
occasion
to
ask
the
mate
he
stood
by
my
side
to
take
a
compass
bearing
of
the
pagoda
i
caught
myself
reaching
up
to
his
ear
in
whispers
i
say
i
caught
myself
but
enough
had
escaped
to
startle
the
man
i
can
t
describe
it
otherwise
than
by
saying
that
he
shied
a
grave
preoccupied
manner
as
though
he
were
in
possession
of
some
perplexing
intelligence
did
not
leave
him
henceforth
a
little
later
i
moved
away
from
the
rail
to
look
at
the
compass
with
such
a
stealthy
gait
that
the
helmsman
noticed
it
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
unusual
roundness
of
his
eyes
these
are
trifling
instances
though
it
s
to
no
commander
s
advantage
to
be
suspected
of
ludicrous
eccentricities
but
i
was
also
more
seriously
affected
there
are
to
a
seaman
certain
words
gestures
that
should
in
given
conditions
come
as
naturally
as
instinctively
as
the
winking
of
a
menaced
eye
a
certain
order
should
spring
on
to
his
lips
without
thinking
a
certain
sign
should
get
itself
made
so
to
speak
without
reflection
but
all
unconscious
alertness
had
abandoned
me
i
had
to
make
an
effort
of
will
to
recall
myself
back
from
the
cabin
to
the
conditions
of
the
moment
i
felt
that
i
was
appearing
an
irresolute
commander
to
those
people
who
were
watching
me
more
or
less
critically
and
besides
there
were
the
scares
on
the
second
day
out
for
instance
coming
off
the
deck
in
the
afternoon
i
had
straw
slippers
on
my
bare
feet
i
stopped
at
the
open
pantry
door
and
spoke
to
the
steward
he
was
doing
something
there
with
his
back
to
me
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
skin
as
the
saying
is
and
incidentally
broke
a
cup
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
with
you
i
asked
astonished
he
was
extremely
confused
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
made
sure
you
were
in
your
you
see
i
wasn
no
sir
i
could
have
sworn
i
had
heard
you
moving
in
there
not
a
moment
ago
it
s
most
extraordinary
very
sorry
i
passed
on
with
an
inward
shudder
i
was
so
identified
with
my
secret
double
that
i
did
not
even
mention
the
fact
in
those
scanty
fearful
whispers
we
exchanged
i
suppose
he
had
made
some
slight
noise
of
some
kind
or
other
it
would
have
been
miraculous
if
he
hadn
t
at
one
time
or
another
and
yet
haggard
as
he
appeared
he
looked
always
perfectly
more
than
calm
almost
invulnerable
on
my
suggestion
he
remained
almost
entirely
in
the
bathroom
which
upon
the
whole
was
the
safest
place
there
could
be
really
no
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
anyone
ever
wanting
to
go
in
there
once
the
steward
had
done
with
it
it
was
a
very
tiny
place
sometimes
he
reclined
on
the
floor
his
legs
bent
his
head
sustained
on
one
elbow
at
others
i
would
find
him
on
the
campstool
sitting
in
his
gray
sleeping
suit
and
with
his
cropped
dark
hair
like
a
patient
unmoved
convict
at
night
i
would
smuggle
him
into
my
bed
place
and
we
would
whisper
together
with
the
regular
footfalls
of
the
officer
of
the
watch
passing
and
repassing
over
our
heads
it
was
an
infinitely
miserable
time
it
was
lucky
that
some
tins
of
fine
preserves
were
stowed
in
a
locker
in
my
stateroom
hard
bread
i
could
always
get
hold
of
and
so
he
lived
on
stewed
chicken
de
foie
asparagus
cooked
oysters
sardines
on
all
sorts
of
abominable
sham
delicacies
out
of
tins
my
coffee
he
always
drank
and
it
was
all
i
dared
do
for
him
in
that
respect
every
day
there
was
the
horrible
maneuvering
to
go
through
so
that
my
room
and
then
the
bathroom
should
be
done
in
the
usual
way
i
came
to
hate
the
sight
of
the
steward
to
abhor
the
voice
of
that
harmless
man
i
felt
that
it
was
he
who
would
bring
on
the
disaster
of
discovery
it
hung
like
a
sword
over
our
heads
the
fourth
day
out
i
think
we
were
then
working
down
the
east
side
of
the
gulf
of
siam
tack
for
tack
in
light
winds
and
smooth
water
the
fourth
day
i
say
of
this
miserable
juggling
with
the
unavoidable
as
we
sat
at
our
evening
meal
that
man
whose
slightest
movement
i
dreaded
after
putting
down
the
dishes
ran
up
on
deck
busily
this
could
not
be
dangerous
presently
he
came
down
again
and
then
it
appeared
that
he
had
remembered
a
coat
of
mine
which
i
had
thrown
over
a
rail
to
dry
after
having
been
wetted
in
a
shower
which
had
passed
over
the
ship
in
the
afternoon
sitting
stolidly
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
became
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
garment
on
his
arm
of
course
he
made
for
my
door
there
was
no
time
to
lose
steward
i
thundered
my
nerves
were
so
shaken
that
i
could
not
govern
my
voice
and
conceal
my
agitation
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
made
my
terrifically
whiskered
mate
tap
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
i
had
detected
him
using
that
gesture
while
talking
on
deck
with
a
confidential
air
to
the
carpenter
it
was
too
far
to
hear
a
word
but
i
had
no
doubt
that
this
pantomime
could
only
refer
to
the
strange
new
captain
yes
sir
the
steward
turned
resignedly
to
me
it
was
this
maddening
course
of
being
shouted
at
checked
without
rhyme
or
reason
arbitrarily
chased
out
of
my
cabin
suddenly
called
into
it
sent
flying
out
of
his
pantry
on
incomprehensible
errands
that
accounted
for
the
growing
wretchedness
of
his
expression
where
are
you
going
with
that
coat
to
your
room
is
there
another
shower
coming
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
sir
shall
i
go
up
again
and
see
sir
no
never
my
object
was
attained
as
of
course
my
other
self
in
there
would
have
heard
everything
that
passed
during
this
interlude
my
two
officers
never
raised
their
eyes
off
their
respective
plates
but
the
lip
of
that
confounded
cub
the
second
mate
quivered
visibly
i
expected
the
steward
to
hook
my
coat
on
and
come
out
at
once
he
was
very
slow
about
it
but
i
dominated
my
nervousness
sufficiently
not
to
shout
after
him
suddenly
i
became
aware
it
could
be
heard
plainly
enough
that
the
fellow
for
some
reason
or
other
was
opening
the
door
of
the
bathroom
it
was
the
end
the
place
was
literally
not
big
enough
to
swing
a
cat
in
my
voice
died
in
my
throat
and
i
went
stony
all
over
i
expected
to
hear
a
yell
of
surprise
and
terror
and
made
a
movement
but
had
not
the
strength
to
get
on
my
legs
everything
remained
still
had
my
second
self
taken
the
poor
wretch
by
the
throat
i
don
t
know
what
i
could
have
done
next
moment
if
i
had
not
seen
the
steward
come
out
of
my
room
close
the
door
and
then
stand
quietly
by
the
sideboard
saved
i
thought
but
no
lost
gone
he
was
gone
i
laid
my
knife
and
fork
down
and
leaned
back
in
my
chair
my
head
swam
after
a
while
when
sufficiently
recovered
to
speak
in
a
steady
voice
i
instructed
my
mate
to
put
the
ship
round
at
eight
o
clock
himself
i
won
t
come
on
deck
i
went
on
i
think
i
ll
turn
in
and
unless
the
wind
shifts
i
don
t
want
to
be
disturbed
before
midnight
i
feel
a
bit
you
did
look
middling
bad
a
little
while
ago
the
chief
mate
remarked
without
showing
any
great
concern
they
both
went
out
and
i
stared
at
the
steward
clearing
the
table
there
was
nothing
to
be
read
on
that
wretched
man
s
face
but
why
did
he
avoid
my
eyes
i
asked
myself
then
i
thought
i
should
like
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
voice
steward
sir
startled
as
usual
where
did
you
hang
up
that
coat
in
the
bathroom
the
usual
anxious
tone
it
s
not
quite
dry
yet
for
some
time
longer
i
sat
in
the
cuddy
had
my
double
vanished
as
he
had
come
but
of
his
coming
there
was
an
explanation
whereas
his
disappearance
would
be
inexplicable
i
went
slowly
into
my
dark
room
shut
the
door
lighted
the
lamp
and
for
a
time
dared
not
turn
round
when
at
last
i
did
i
saw
him
standing
in
the
narrow
recessed
part
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
i
had
a
shock
but
an
irresistible
doubt
of
his
bodily
existence
flitted
through
my
mind
can
it
be
i
asked
myself
that
he
is
not
visible
to
other
eyes
than
mine
it
was
like
being
haunted
motionless
with
a
grave
face
he
raised
his
hands
slightly
at
me
in
a
gesture
which
meant
clearly
heavens
what
a
narrow
escape
narrow
indeed
i
think
i
had
come
creeping
quietly
as
near
insanity
as
any
man
who
has
not
actually
gone
over
the
border
that
gesture
restrained
me
so
to
speak
the
mate
with
the
terrific
whiskers
was
now
putting
the
ship
on
the
other
tack
in
the
moment
of
profound
silence
which
follows
upon
the
hands
going
to
their
stations
i
heard
on
the
poop
his
raised
voice
hard
alee
and
the
distant
shout
of
the
order
repeated
on
the
the
sails
in
that
light
breeze
made
but
a
faint
fluttering
noise
it
ceased
the
ship
was
coming
round
slowly
i
held
my
breath
in
the
renewed
stillness
of
expectation
one
wouldn
t
have
thought
that
there
was
a
single
living
soul
on
her
decks
a
sudden
brisk
shout
mainsail
haul
broke
the
spell
and
in
the
noisy
cries
and
rush
overhead
of
the
men
running
away
with
the
main
brace
we
two
down
in
my
cabin
came
together
in
our
usual
position
by
the
bed
place
he
did
not
wait
for
my
question
i
heard
him
fumbling
here
and
just
managed
to
squat
myself
down
in
the
bath
he
whispered
to
me
the
fellow
only
opened
the
door
and
put
his
arm
in
to
hang
the
coat
up
all
the
same
i
never
thought
of
that
i
whispered
back
even
more
appalled
than
before
at
the
closeness
of
the
shave
and
marveling
at
that
something
unyielding
in
his
character
which
was
carrying
him
through
so
finely
there
was
no
agitation
in
his
whisper
whoever
was
being
driven
distracted
it
was
not
he
he
was
sane
and
the
proof
of
his
sanity
was
continued
when
he
took
up
the
whispering
again
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
come
to
life
it
was
something
that
a
ghost
might
have
said
but
what
he
was
alluding
to
was
his
old
captain
s
reluctant
admission
of
the
theory
of
suicide
it
would
obviously
serve
his
turn
if
i
had
understood
at
all
the
view
which
seemed
to
govern
the
unalterable
purpose
of
his
action
you
must
maroon
me
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
get
amongst
these
islands
off
the
cambodge
shore
he
went
on
maroon
you
we
are
not
living
in
a
boy
s
adventure
tale
i
protested
his
scornful
whispering
took
me
up
we
aren
t
indeed
there
s
nothing
of
a
boy
s
tale
in
this
but
there
s
nothing
else
for
it
i
want
no
more
you
don
t
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
what
can
be
done
to
me
prison
or
gallows
or
whatever
they
may
please
but
you
don
t
see
me
coming
back
to
explain
such
things
to
an
old
fellow
in
a
wig
and
twelve
respectable
tradesmen
do
you
what
can
they
know
whether
i
am
guilty
or
not
or
of
i
am
guilty
either
that
s
my
affair
what
does
the
bible
say
driven
off
the
face
of
the
very
well
i
am
off
the
face
of
the
earth
now
as
i
came
at
night
so
i
shall
impossible
i
murmured
you
can
can
t
not
naked
like
a
soul
on
the
day
of
judgment
i
shall
freeze
on
to
this
sleeping
suit
the
last
day
is
not
yet
and
you
have
understood
thoroughly
didn
t
you
i
felt
suddenly
ashamed
of
myself
i
may
say
truly
that
i
understood
and
my
hesitation
in
letting
that
man
swim
away
from
my
ship
s
side
had
been
a
mere
sham
sentiment
a
sort
of
cowardice
it
can
t
be
done
now
till
next
night
i
breathed
out
the
ship
is
on
the
tack
and
the
wind
may
fail
as
long
as
i
know
that
you
understand
he
whispered
but
of
course
you
do
it
s
a
great
satisfaction
to
have
got
somebody
to
understand
you
seem
to
have
been
there
on
and
in
the
same
whisper
as
if
we
two
whenever
we
talked
had
to
say
things
to
each
other
which
were
not
fit
for
the
world
to
hear
he
added
it
s
very
we
remained
side
by
side
talking
in
our
secret
way
but
sometimes
silent
or
just
exchanging
a
whispered
word
or
two
at
long
intervals
and
as
usual
he
stared
through
the
port
a
breath
of
wind
came
now
and
again
into
our
faces
the
ship
might
have
been
moored
in
dock
so
gently
and
on
an
even
keel
she
slipped
through
the
water
that
did
not
murmur
even
at
our
passage
shadowy
and
silent
like
a
phantom
sea
at
midnight
i
went
on
deck
and
to
my
mate
s
great
surprise
put
the
ship
round
on
the
other
tack
his
terrible
whiskers
flitted
round
me
in
silent
criticism
i
certainly
should
not
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
only
a
question
of
getting
out
of
that
sleepy
gulf
as
quickly
as
possible
i
believe
he
told
the
second
mate
who
relieved
him
that
it
was
a
great
want
of
judgment
the
other
only
yawned
that
intolerable
cub
shuffled
about
so
sleepily
and
lolled
against
the
rails
in
such
a
slack
improper
fashion
that
i
came
down
on
him
sharply
aren
t
you
properly
awake
yet
yes
sir
i
am
well
then
be
good
enough
to
hold
yourself
as
if
you
were
and
keep
a
lookout
if
there
s
any
current
we
ll
be
closing
with
some
islands
before
the
east
side
of
the
gulf
is
fringed
with
islands
some
solitary
others
in
groups
on
the
blue
background
of
the
high
coast
they
seem
to
float
on
silvery
patches
of
calm
water
arid
and
gray
or
dark
green
and
rounded
like
clumps
of
evergreen
bushes
with
the
larger
ones
a
mile
or
two
long
showing
the
outlines
of
ridges
ribs
of
gray
rock
under
the
dark
mantle
of
matted
leafage
unknown
to
trade
to
travel
almost
to
geography
the
manner
of
life
they
harbor
is
an
unsolved
secret
there
must
be
villages
settlements
of
fishermen
at
least
on
the
largest
of
them
and
some
communication
with
the
world
is
probably
kept
up
by
native
craft
but
all
that
forenoon
as
we
headed
for
them
fanned
along
by
the
faintest
of
breezes
i
saw
no
sign
of
man
or
canoe
in
the
field
of
the
telescope
i
kept
on
pointing
at
the
scattered
group
at
noon
i
gave
no
orders
for
a
change
of
course
and
the
mate
s
whiskers
became
much
concerned
and
seemed
to
be
offering
themselves
unduly
to
my
notice
at
last
i
said
i
am
going
to
stand
right
in
quite
in
as
far
as
i
can
take
the
stare
of
extreme
surprise
imparted
an
air
of
ferocity
also
to
his
eyes
and
he
looked
truly
terrific
for
a
moment
we
re
not
doing
well
in
the
middle
of
the
gulf
i
continued
casually
i
am
going
to
look
for
the
land
breezes
bless
my
soul
do
you
mean
sir
in
the
dark
amongst
the
lot
of
all
them
islands
and
reefs
and
shoals
well
if
there
are
any
regular
land
breezes
at
all
on
this
coast
one
must
get
close
inshore
to
find
them
mustn
t
one
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
again
under
his
breath
all
that
afternoon
he
wore
a
dreamy
contemplative
appearance
which
in
him
was
a
mark
of
perplexity
after
dinner
i
went
into
my
stateroom
as
if
i
meant
to
take
some
rest
there
we
two
bent
our
dark
heads
over
a
chart
lying
on
my
bed
there
i
said
it
s
got
to
be
i
ve
been
looking
at
it
ever
since
sunrise
it
has
got
two
hills
and
a
low
point
it
must
be
inhabited
and
on
the
coast
opposite
there
is
what
looks
like
the
mouth
of
a
biggish
river
with
some
towns
no
doubt
not
far
up
it
s
the
best
chance
for
you
that
i
can
anything
let
it
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
chart
as
if
surveying
chances
and
distances
from
a
lofty
height
and
following
with
his
eyes
his
own
figure
wandering
on
the
blank
land
of
and
then
passing
off
that
piece
of
paper
clean
out
of
sight
into
uncharted
regions
and
it
was
as
if
the
ship
had
two
captains
to
plan
her
course
for
her
i
had
been
so
worried
and
restless
running
up
and
down
that
i
had
not
had
the
patience
to
dress
that
day
i
had
remained
in
my
sleeping
suit
with
straw
slippers
and
a
soft
floppy
hat
the
closeness
of
the
heat
in
the
gulf
had
been
most
oppressive
and
the
crew
were
used
to
seeing
me
wandering
in
that
airy
attire
she
will
clear
the
south
point
as
she
heads
now
i
whispered
into
his
ear
goodness
only
knows
when
though
but
certainly
after
dark
i
ll
edge
her
in
to
half
a
mile
as
far
as
i
may
be
able
to
judge
in
the
dark
be
careful
he
murmured
warningly
and
i
realized
suddenly
that
all
my
future
the
only
future
for
which
i
was
fit
would
perhaps
go
irretrievably
to
pieces
in
any
mishap
to
my
first
command
i
could
not
stop
a
moment
longer
in
the
room
i
motioned
him
to
get
out
of
sight
and
made
my
way
on
the
poop
that
unplayful
cub
had
the
watch
i
walked
up
and
down
for
a
while
thinking
things
out
then
beckoned
him
over
send
a
couple
of
hands
to
open
the
two
ports
i
said
mildly
he
actually
had
the
impudence
or
else
so
forgot
himself
in
his
wonder
at
such
an
incomprehensible
order
as
to
repeat
open
the
ports
what
for
sir
the
only
reason
you
need
concern
yourself
about
is
because
i
tell
you
to
do
so
have
them
open
wide
and
fastened
he
reddened
and
went
off
but
i
believe
made
some
jeering
remark
to
the
carpenter
as
to
the
sensible
practice
of
ventilating
a
ship
s
i
know
he
popped
into
the
mate
s
cabin
to
impart
the
fact
to
him
because
the
whiskers
came
on
deck
as
it
were
by
chance
and
stole
glances
at
me
from
below
for
signs
of
lunacy
or
drunkenness
i
suppose
a
little
before
supper
feeling
more
restless
than
ever
i
rejoined
for
a
moment
my
second
self
and
to
find
him
sitting
so
quietly
was
surprising
like
something
against
nature
inhuman
i
developed
my
plan
in
a
hurried
whisper
i
shall
stand
in
as
close
as
i
dare
and
then
put
her
round
i
will
presently
find
means
to
smuggle
you
out
of
here
into
the
sail
locker
which
communicates
with
the
lobby
but
there
is
an
opening
a
sort
of
square
for
hauling
the
sails
out
which
gives
straight
on
the
and
which
is
never
closed
in
fine
weather
so
as
to
give
air
to
the
sails
when
the
ship
s
way
is
deadened
in
stays
and
all
the
hands
are
aft
at
the
main
braces
you
will
have
a
clear
road
to
slip
out
and
get
overboard
through
the
open
port
i
ve
had
them
both
fastened
up
use
a
rope
s
end
to
lower
yourself
into
the
water
so
as
to
avoid
a
splash
you
know
it
could
be
heard
and
cause
some
beastly
he
kept
silent
for
a
while
then
whispered
i
i
won
t
be
there
to
see
you
go
i
began
with
an
effort
the
rest
i
only
hope
i
have
understood
you
have
from
first
to
last
and
for
the
first
time
there
seemed
to
be
a
faltering
something
strained
in
his
whisper
he
caught
hold
of
my
arm
but
the
ringing
of
the
supper
bell
made
me
start
he
didn
t
though
he
only
released
his
grip
after
supper
i
didn
t
come
below
again
till
well
past
eight
o
clock
the
faint
steady
breeze
was
loaded
with
dew
and
the
wet
darkened
sails
held
all
there
was
of
propelling
power
in
it
the
night
clear
and
starry
sparkled
darkly
and
the
opaque
lightless
patches
shifting
slowly
against
the
low
stars
were
the
drifting
islets
on
the
port
bow
there
was
a
big
one
more
distant
and
shadowily
imposing
by
the
great
space
of
sky
it
eclipsed
on
opening
the
door
i
had
a
back
view
of
my
very
own
self
looking
at
a
chart
he
had
come
out
of
the
recess
and
was
standing
near
the
table
quite
dark
enough
i
whispered
he
stepped
back
and
leaned
against
my
bed
with
a
level
quiet
glance
i
sat
on
the
couch
we
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
over
our
heads
the
officer
of
the
watch
moved
here
and
there
then
i
heard
him
move
quickly
i
knew
what
that
meant
he
was
making
for
the
companion
and
presently
his
voice
was
outside
my
door
we
are
drawing
in
pretty
fast
sir
land
looks
rather
very
well
i
answered
i
am
coming
on
deck
i
waited
till
he
was
gone
out
of
the
cuddy
then
rose
my
double
moved
too
the
time
had
come
to
exchange
our
last
whispers
for
neither
of
us
was
ever
to
hear
each
other
s
natural
voice
look
here
i
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
three
sovereigns
take
this
anyhow
i
ve
got
six
and
i
d
give
you
the
lot
only
i
must
keep
a
little
money
to
buy
some
fruit
and
vegetables
for
the
crew
from
native
boats
as
we
go
through
sunda
he
shook
his
head
take
it
i
urged
him
whispering
desperately
no
one
can
tell
what
he
smiled
and
slapped
meaningly
the
only
pocket
of
the
sleeping
jacket
it
was
not
safe
certainly
but
i
produced
a
large
old
silk
handkerchief
of
mine
and
tying
the
three
pieces
of
gold
in
a
corner
pressed
it
on
him
he
was
touched
i
supposed
because
he
took
it
at
last
and
tied
it
quickly
round
his
waist
under
the
jacket
on
his
bare
skin
our
eyes
met
several
seconds
elapsed
till
our
glances
still
mingled
i
extended
my
hand
and
turned
the
lamp
out
then
i
passed
through
the
cuddy
leaving
the
door
of
my
room
wide
open
steward
he
was
still
lingering
in
the
pantry
in
the
greatness
of
his
zeal
giving
a
to
a
plated
cruet
stand
the
last
thing
before
going
to
bed
being
careful
not
to
wake
up
the
mate
whose
room
was
opposite
i
spoke
in
an
undertone
he
looked
round
anxiously
sir
can
you
get
me
a
little
hot
water
from
the
galley
i
am
afraid
sir
the
galley
fire
s
been
out
for
some
time
go
and
he
flew
up
the
stairs
now
i
whispered
loudly
into
the
saloon
too
loudly
perhaps
but
i
was
afraid
i
couldn
t
make
a
sound
he
was
by
my
side
in
an
instant
the
double
captain
slipped
past
the
stairs
through
a
tiny
dark
passage
a
sliding
door
we
were
in
the
sail
locker
scrambling
on
our
knees
over
the
sails
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
i
saw
myself
wandering
barefooted
bareheaded
the
sun
beating
on
my
dark
poll
i
snatched
off
my
floppy
hat
and
tried
hurriedly
in
the
dark
to
ram
it
on
my
other
self
he
dodged
and
fended
off
silently
i
wonder
what
he
thought
had
come
to
me
before
he
understood
and
suddenly
desisted
our
hands
met
gropingly
lingered
united
in
a
steady
motionless
clasp
for
a
second
no
word
was
breathed
by
either
of
us
when
they
separated
i
was
standing
quietly
by
the
pantry
door
when
the
steward
returned
sorry
sir
kettle
barely
warm
shall
i
light
the
spirit
lamp
never
i
came
out
on
deck
slowly
it
was
now
a
matter
of
conscience
to
shave
the
land
as
close
as
possible
for
now
he
must
go
overboard
whenever
the
ship
was
put
in
stays
must
there
could
be
no
going
back
for
him
after
a
moment
i
walked
over
to
leeward
and
my
heart
flew
into
my
mouth
at
the
nearness
of
the
land
on
the
bow
under
any
other
circumstances
i
would
not
have
held
on
a
minute
longer
the
second
mate
had
followed
me
anxiously
i
looked
on
till
i
felt
i
could
command
my
voice
she
will
weather
i
said
then
in
a
quiet
tone
are
you
going
to
try
that
sir
he
stammered
out
incredulously
i
took
no
notice
of
him
and
raised
my
tone
just
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
helmsman
keep
her
good
good
full
the
wind
fanned
my
cheek
the
sails
slept
the
world
was
silent
the
strain
of
watching
the
dark
loom
of
the
land
grow
bigger
and
denser
was
too
much
for
me
i
had
shut
my
eyes
because
the
ship
must
go
closer
she
must
the
stillness
was
intolerable
were
we
standing
still
when
i
opened
my
eyes
the
second
view
started
my
heart
with
a
thump
the
black
southern
hill
of
seemed
to
hang
right
over
the
ship
like
a
towering
fragment
of
everlasting
night
on
that
enormous
mass
of
blackness
there
was
not
a
gleam
to
be
seen
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
it
was
gliding
irresistibly
towards
us
and
yet
seemed
already
within
reach
of
the
hand
i
saw
the
vague
figures
of
the
watch
grouped
in
the
waist
gazing
in
awed
silence
are
you
going
on
sir
inquired
an
unsteady
voice
at
my
elbow
i
ignored
it
i
had
to
go
on
keep
her
full
don
t
check
her
way
that
won
t
do
now
i
said
warningly
i
can
t
see
the
sails
very
well
the
helmsman
answered
me
in
strange
quavering
tones
was
she
close
enough
already
she
was
i
won
t
say
in
the
shadow
of
the
land
but
in
the
very
blackness
of
it
already
swallowed
up
as
it
were
gone
too
close
to
be
recalled
gone
from
me
altogether
give
the
mate
a
call
i
said
to
the
young
man
who
stood
at
my
elbow
as
still
as
death
and
turn
all
hands
my
tone
had
a
borrowed
loudness
reverberated
from
the
height
of
the
land
several
voices
cried
out
together
we
are
all
on
deck
then
stillness
again
with
the
great
shadow
gliding
closer
towering
higher
without
a
light
without
a
sound
such
a
hush
had
fallen
on
the
ship
that
she
might
have
been
a
bark
of
the
dead
floating
in
slowly
under
the
very
gate
of
erebus
my
god
where
are
we
it
was
the
mate
moaning
at
my
elbow
he
was
thunderstruck
and
as
it
were
deprived
of
the
moral
support
of
his
whiskers
he
clapped
his
hands
and
absolutely
cried
out
lost
be
quiet
i
said
sternly
he
lowered
his
tone
but
i
saw
the
shadowy
gesture
of
his
despair
what
are
we
doing
here
looking
for
the
land
he
made
as
if
to
tear
his
hair
and
addressed
me
recklessly
she
will
never
get
out
you
have
done
it
sir
i
knew
it
d
end
in
something
like
this
she
will
never
weather
and
you
are
too
close
now
to
stay
she
ll
drift
ashore
before
she
s
round
oh
my
god
i
caught
his
arm
as
he
was
raising
it
to
batter
his
poor
devoted
head
and
shook
it
violently
she
s
ashore
already
he
wailed
trying
to
tear
himself
away
is
she
keep
good
full
there
good
full
sir
cried
the
helmsman
in
a
frightened
thin
childlike
voice
i
hadn
t
let
go
the
mate
s
arm
and
went
on
shaking
it
ready
about
do
you
hear
you
go
forward
shake
and
stop
there
shake
and
hold
your
noise
shake
and
see
these
properly
overhauled
shake
shake
shake
and
all
the
time
i
dared
not
look
towards
the
land
lest
my
heart
should
fail
me
i
released
my
grip
at
last
and
he
ran
forward
as
if
fleeing
for
dear
life
i
wondered
what
my
double
there
in
the
sail
locker
thought
of
this
commotion
he
was
able
to
hear
everything
and
perhaps
he
was
able
to
understand
why
on
my
conscience
it
had
to
be
thus
close
no
less
my
first
order
hard
alee
ominously
under
the
towering
shadow
of
as
if
i
had
shouted
in
a
mountain
gorge
and
then
i
watched
the
land
intently
in
that
smooth
water
and
light
wind
it
was
impossible
to
feel
the
ship
no
i
could
not
feel
her
and
my
second
self
was
making
now
ready
to
ship
out
and
lower
himself
overboard
perhaps
he
was
gone
already
the
great
black
mass
brooding
over
our
very
mastheads
began
to
pivot
away
from
the
ship
s
side
silently
and
now
i
forgot
the
secret
stranger
ready
to
depart
and
remembered
only
that
i
was
a
total
stranger
to
the
ship
i
did
not
know
her
would
she
do
it
how
was
she
to
be
handled
i
swung
the
mainyard
and
waited
helplessly
she
was
perhaps
stopped
and
her
very
fate
hung
in
the
balance
with
the
black
mass
of
like
the
gate
of
the
everlasting
night
towering
over
her
taffrail
what
would
she
do
now
had
she
way
on
her
yet
i
stepped
to
the
side
swiftly
and
on
the
shadowy
water
i
could
see
nothing
except
a
faint
phosphorescent
flash
revealing
the
glassy
smoothness
of
the
sleeping
surface
it
was
impossible
to
tell
and
i
had
not
learned
yet
the
feel
of
my
ship
was
she
moving
what
i
needed
was
something
easily
seen
a
piece
of
paper
which
i
could
throw
overboard
and
watch
i
had
nothing
on
me
to
run
down
for
it
i
didn
t
dare
there
was
no
time
all
at
once
my
strained
yearning
stare
distinguished
a
white
object
floating
within
a
yard
of
the
ship
s
side
white
on
the
black
water
a
phosphorescent
flash
passed
under
it
what
was
that
thing
i
recognized
my
own
floppy
hat
it
must
have
fallen
off
his
head
and
he
didn
t
bother
now
i
had
what
i
wanted
the
saving
mark
for
my
eyes
but
i
hardly
thought
of
my
other
self
now
gone
from
the
ship
to
be
hidden
forever
from
all
friendly
faces
to
be
a
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
on
the
earth
with
no
brand
of
the
curse
on
his
sane
forehead
to
stay
a
slaying
hand
too
proud
to
explain
and
i
watched
the
hat
the
expression
of
my
sudden
pity
for
his
mere
flesh
it
had
been
meant
to
save
his
homeless
head
from
the
dangers
of
the
sun
and
now
behold
it
was
saving
the
ship
by
serving
me
for
a
mark
to
help
out
the
ignorance
of
my
strangeness
ha
it
was
drifting
forward
warning
me
just
in
time
that
the
ship
had
gathered
sternaway
shift
the
helm
i
said
in
a
low
voice
to
the
seaman
standing
still
like
a
statue
the
man
s
eyes
glistened
wildly
in
the
binnacle
light
as
he
jumped
round
to
the
other
side
and
spun
round
the
wheel
i
walked
to
the
break
of
the
poop
on
the
deck
all
hands
stood
by
the
forebraces
waiting
for
my
order
the
stars
ahead
seemed
to
be
gliding
from
right
to
left
and
all
was
so
still
in
the
world
that
i
heard
the
quiet
remark
she
s
round
passed
in
a
tone
of
intense
relief
between
two
seamen
let
go
and
the
foreyards
ran
round
with
a
great
noise
amidst
cheery
cries
and
now
the
frightful
whiskers
made
themselves
heard
giving
various
orders
already
the
ship
was
drawing
ahead
and
i
was
alone
with
her
nothing
no
one
in
the
world
should
stand
now
between
us
throwing
a
shadow
on
the
way
of
silent
knowledge
and
mute
affection
the
perfect
communion
of
a
seaman
with
his
first
command
walking
to
the
taffrail
i
was
in
time
to
make
out
on
the
very
edge
of
a
darkness
thrown
by
a
towering
black
mass
like
the
very
gateway
of
erebus
yes
i
was
in
time
to
catch
an
evanescent
glimpse
of
my
white
hat
left
behind
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
secret
sharer
of
my
cabin
and
of
my
thoughts
as
though
he
were
my
second
self
had
lowered
himself
into
the
water
to
take
his
punishment
a
free
man
a
proud
swimmer
striking
out
for
a
new
destiny
