indian
tale
by
hermann
hesse
first
part
to
romain
rolland
my
dear
friend
the
son
of
the
brahman
in
the
shade
of
the
house
in
the
sunshine
of
the
riverbank
near
the
boats
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
in
the
shade
of
the
fig
tree
is
where
siddhartha
grew
up
the
handsome
son
of
the
brahman
the
young
falcon
together
with
his
friend
govinda
son
of
a
brahman
the
sun
tanned
his
light
shoulders
by
the
banks
of
the
river
when
bathing
performing
the
sacred
ablutions
the
sacred
offerings
in
the
mango
grove
shade
poured
into
his
black
eyes
when
playing
as
a
boy
when
his
mother
sang
when
the
sacred
offerings
were
made
when
his
father
the
scholar
taught
him
when
the
wise
men
talked
for
a
long
time
siddhartha
had
been
partaking
in
the
discussions
of
the
wise
men
practising
debate
with
govinda
practising
with
govinda
the
art
of
reflection
the
service
of
meditation
he
already
knew
how
to
speak
the
om
silently
the
word
of
words
to
speak
it
silently
into
himself
while
inhaling
to
speak
it
silently
out
of
himself
while
exhaling
with
all
the
concentration
of
his
soul
the
forehead
surrounded
by
the
glow
of
the
spirit
he
already
knew
to
feel
atman
in
the
depths
of
his
being
indestructible
one
with
the
universe
joy
leapt
in
his
father
heart
for
his
son
who
was
quick
to
learn
thirsty
for
knowledge
he
saw
him
growing
up
to
become
great
wise
man
and
priest
a
prince
among
the
brahmans
bliss
leapt
in
his
mother
breast
when
she
saw
him
when
she
saw
him
walking
when
she
saw
him
sit
down
and
get
up
siddhartha
strong
handsome
he
who
was
walking
on
slender
legs
greeting
her
with
perfect
respect
love
touched
the
hearts
of
the
brahmans
young
daughters
when
siddhartha
walked
through
the
lanes
of
the
town
with
the
luminous
forehead
with
the
eye
of
a
king
with
his
slim
hips
but
more
than
all
the
others
he
was
loved
by
govinda
his
friend
the
son
of
a
brahman
he
loved
siddhartha
eye
and
sweet
voice
he
loved
his
walk
and
the
perfect
decency
of
his
movements
he
loved
everything
siddhartha
did
and
said
and
what
he
loved
most
was
his
spirit
his
transcendent
fiery
thoughts
his
ardent
will
his
high
calling
govinda
knew
he
would
not
become
a
common
brahman
not
a
lazy
official
in
charge
of
offerings
not
a
greedy
merchant
with
magic
spells
not
a
vain
vacuous
speaker
not
a
mean
deceitful
priest
and
also
not
a
decent
stupid
sheep
in
the
herd
of
the
many
no
and
he
govinda
as
well
did
not
want
to
become
one
of
those
not
one
of
those
tens
of
thousands
of
brahmans
he
wanted
to
follow
siddhartha
the
beloved
the
splendid
and
in
days
to
come
when
siddhartha
would
become
a
god
when
he
would
join
the
glorious
then
govinda
wanted
to
follow
him
as
his
friend
his
companion
his
servant
his
his
shadow
siddhartha
was
thus
loved
by
everyone
he
was
a
source
of
joy
for
everybody
he
was
a
delight
for
them
all
but
he
siddhartha
was
not
a
source
of
joy
for
himself
he
found
no
delight
in
himself
walking
the
rosy
paths
of
the
fig
tree
garden
sitting
in
the
bluish
shade
of
the
grove
of
contemplation
washing
his
limbs
daily
in
the
bath
of
repentance
sacrificing
in
the
dim
shade
of
the
mango
forest
his
gestures
of
perfect
decency
everyone
love
and
joy
he
still
lacked
all
joy
in
his
heart
dreams
and
restless
thoughts
came
into
his
mind
flowing
from
the
water
of
the
river
sparkling
from
the
stars
of
the
night
melting
from
the
beams
of
the
sun
dreams
came
to
him
and
a
restlessness
of
the
soul
fuming
from
the
sacrifices
breathing
forth
from
the
verses
of
the
being
infused
into
him
drop
by
drop
from
the
teachings
of
the
old
brahmans
siddhartha
had
started
to
nurse
discontent
in
himself
he
had
started
to
feel
that
the
love
of
his
father
and
the
love
of
his
mother
and
also
the
love
of
his
friend
govinda
would
not
bring
him
joy
for
ever
and
ever
would
not
nurse
him
feed
him
satisfy
him
he
had
started
to
suspect
that
his
venerable
father
and
his
other
teachers
that
the
wise
brahmans
had
already
revealed
to
him
the
most
and
best
of
their
wisdom
that
they
had
already
filled
his
expecting
vessel
with
their
richness
and
the
vessel
was
not
full
the
spirit
was
not
content
the
soul
was
not
calm
the
heart
was
not
satisfied
the
ablutions
were
good
but
they
were
water
they
did
not
wash
off
the
sin
they
did
not
heal
the
spirit
thirst
they
did
not
relieve
the
fear
in
his
heart
the
sacrifices
and
the
invocation
of
the
gods
were
excellent
but
was
that
all
did
the
sacrifices
give
a
happy
fortune
and
what
about
the
gods
was
it
really
prajapati
who
had
created
the
world
was
it
not
the
atman
he
the
only
one
the
singular
one
were
the
gods
not
creations
created
like
me
and
you
subject
to
time
mortal
was
it
therefore
good
was
it
right
was
it
meaningful
and
the
highest
occupation
to
make
offerings
to
the
gods
for
whom
else
were
offerings
to
be
made
who
else
was
to
be
worshipped
but
him
the
only
one
the
atman
and
where
was
atman
to
be
found
where
did
he
reside
where
did
his
eternal
heart
beat
where
else
but
in
one
own
self
in
its
innermost
part
in
its
indestructible
part
which
everyone
had
in
himself
but
where
where
was
this
self
this
innermost
part
this
ultimate
part
it
was
not
flesh
and
bone
it
was
neither
thought
nor
consciousness
thus
the
wisest
ones
taught
so
where
where
was
it
to
reach
this
place
the
self
myself
the
atman
there
was
another
way
which
was
worthwhile
looking
for
alas
and
nobody
showed
this
way
nobody
knew
it
not
the
father
and
not
the
teachers
and
wise
men
not
the
holy
sacrificial
songs
they
knew
everything
the
brahmans
and
their
holy
books
they
knew
everything
they
had
taken
care
of
everything
and
of
more
than
everything
the
creation
of
the
world
the
origin
of
speech
of
food
of
inhaling
of
exhaling
the
arrangement
of
the
senses
the
acts
of
the
gods
they
knew
infinitely
much
but
was
it
valuable
to
know
all
of
this
not
knowing
that
one
and
only
thing
the
most
important
thing
the
solely
important
thing
surely
many
verses
of
the
holy
books
particularly
in
the
upanishades
of
samaveda
spoke
of
this
innermost
and
ultimate
thing
wonderful
verses
your
soul
is
the
whole
world
was
written
there
and
it
was
written
that
man
in
his
sleep
in
his
deep
sleep
would
meet
with
his
innermost
part
and
would
reside
in
the
atman
marvellous
wisdom
was
in
these
verses
all
knowledge
of
the
wisest
ones
had
been
collected
here
in
magic
words
pure
as
honey
collected
by
bees
no
not
to
be
looked
down
upon
was
the
tremendous
amount
of
enlightenment
which
lay
here
collected
and
preserved
by
innumerable
generations
of
wise
but
where
were
the
brahmans
where
the
priests
where
the
wise
men
or
penitents
who
had
succeeded
in
not
just
knowing
this
deepest
of
all
knowledge
but
also
to
live
it
where
was
the
knowledgeable
one
who
wove
his
spell
to
bring
his
familiarity
with
the
atman
out
of
the
sleep
into
the
state
of
being
awake
into
the
life
into
every
step
of
the
way
into
word
and
deed
siddhartha
knew
many
venerable
brahmans
chiefly
his
father
the
pure
one
the
scholar
the
most
venerable
one
his
father
was
to
be
admired
quiet
and
noble
were
his
manners
pure
his
life
wise
his
words
delicate
and
noble
thoughts
lived
behind
its
brow
but
even
he
who
knew
so
much
did
he
live
in
blissfulness
did
he
have
peace
was
he
not
also
just
a
searching
man
a
thirsty
man
did
he
not
again
and
again
have
to
drink
from
holy
sources
as
a
thirsty
man
from
the
offerings
from
the
books
from
the
disputes
of
the
brahmans
why
did
he
the
irreproachable
one
have
to
wash
off
sins
every
day
strive
for
a
cleansing
every
day
over
and
over
every
day
was
not
atman
in
him
did
not
the
pristine
source
spring
from
his
heart
it
had
to
be
found
the
pristine
source
in
one
own
self
it
had
to
be
possessed
everything
else
was
searching
was
a
detour
was
getting
lost
thus
were
siddhartha
thoughts
this
was
his
thirst
this
was
his
suffering
often
he
spoke
to
himself
from
a
the
words
truly
the
name
of
the
brahman
is
satyam
verily
he
who
knows
such
a
thing
will
enter
the
heavenly
world
every
day
often
it
seemed
near
the
heavenly
world
but
never
he
had
reached
it
completely
never
he
had
quenched
the
ultimate
thirst
and
among
all
the
wise
and
wisest
men
he
knew
and
whose
instructions
he
had
received
among
all
of
them
there
was
no
one
who
had
reached
it
completely
the
heavenly
world
who
had
quenched
it
completely
the
eternal
thirst
govinda
siddhartha
spoke
to
his
friend
govinda
my
dear
come
with
me
under
the
banyan
tree
let
practise
meditation
they
went
to
the
banyan
tree
they
sat
down
siddhartha
right
here
govinda
twenty
paces
away
while
putting
himself
down
ready
to
speak
the
om
siddhartha
repeated
murmuring
the
verse
om
is
the
bow
the
arrow
is
soul
the
brahman
is
the
arrow
target
that
one
should
incessantly
hit
after
the
usual
time
of
the
exercise
in
meditation
had
passed
govinda
rose
the
evening
had
come
it
was
time
to
perform
the
evening
ablution
he
called
siddhartha
name
siddhartha
did
not
answer
siddhartha
sat
there
lost
in
thought
his
eyes
were
rigidly
focused
towards
a
very
distant
target
the
tip
of
his
tongue
was
protruding
a
little
between
the
teeth
he
seemed
not
to
breathe
thus
sat
he
wrapped
up
in
contemplation
thinking
om
his
soul
sent
after
the
brahman
as
an
arrow
once
samanas
had
travelled
through
siddhartha
town
ascetics
on
a
pilgrimage
three
skinny
withered
men
neither
old
nor
young
with
dusty
and
bloody
shoulders
almost
naked
scorched
by
the
sun
surrounded
by
loneliness
strangers
and
enemies
to
the
world
strangers
and
lank
jackals
in
the
realm
of
humans
behind
them
blew
a
hot
scent
of
quiet
passion
of
destructive
service
of
merciless
in
the
evening
after
the
hour
of
contemplation
siddhartha
spoke
to
govinda
early
tomorrow
morning
my
friend
siddhartha
will
go
to
the
samanas
he
will
become
a
samana
govinda
turned
pale
when
he
heard
these
words
and
read
the
decision
in
the
motionless
face
of
his
friend
unstoppable
like
the
arrow
shot
from
the
bow
soon
and
with
the
first
glance
govinda
realized
now
it
is
beginning
now
siddhartha
is
taking
his
own
way
now
his
fate
is
beginning
to
sprout
and
with
his
my
own
and
he
turned
pale
like
a
dry
o
siddhartha
he
exclaimed
will
your
father
permit
you
to
do
that
siddhartha
looked
over
as
if
he
was
just
waking
up
he
read
in
govinda
soul
read
the
fear
read
the
submission
o
govinda
he
spoke
quietly
let
not
waste
words
tomorrow
at
daybreak
i
will
begin
the
life
of
the
samanas
speak
no
more
of
it
siddhartha
entered
the
chamber
where
his
father
was
sitting
on
a
mat
of
bast
and
stepped
behind
his
father
and
remained
standing
there
until
his
father
felt
that
someone
was
standing
behind
him
quoth
the
brahman
is
that
you
siddhartha
then
say
what
you
came
to
say
quoth
siddhartha
with
your
permission
my
father
i
came
to
tell
you
that
it
is
my
longing
to
leave
your
house
tomorrow
and
go
to
the
ascetics
my
desire
is
to
become
a
samana
may
my
father
not
oppose
this
the
brahman
fell
silent
and
remained
silent
for
so
long
that
the
stars
in
the
small
window
wandered
and
changed
their
relative
positions
the
silence
was
broken
silent
and
motionless
stood
the
son
with
his
arms
folded
silent
and
motionless
sat
the
father
on
the
mat
and
the
stars
traced
their
paths
in
the
sky
then
spoke
the
father
not
proper
it
is
for
a
brahman
to
speak
harsh
and
angry
words
but
indignation
is
in
my
heart
i
wish
not
to
hear
this
request
for
a
second
time
from
your
mouth
slowly
the
brahman
rose
siddhartha
stood
silently
his
arms
folded
what
are
you
waiting
for
asked
the
father
quoth
siddhartha
you
know
what
indignant
the
father
left
the
chamber
indignant
he
went
to
his
bed
and
lay
down
after
an
hour
since
no
sleep
had
come
over
his
eyes
the
brahman
stood
up
paced
to
and
fro
and
left
the
house
through
the
small
window
of
the
chamber
he
looked
back
inside
and
there
he
saw
siddhartha
standing
his
arms
folded
not
moving
from
his
spot
pale
shimmered
his
bright
robe
with
anxiety
in
his
heart
the
father
returned
to
his
bed
after
another
hour
since
no
sleep
had
come
over
his
eyes
the
brahman
stood
up
again
paced
to
and
fro
walked
out
of
the
house
and
saw
that
the
moon
had
risen
through
the
window
of
the
chamber
he
looked
back
inside
there
stood
siddhartha
not
moving
from
his
spot
his
arms
folded
moonlight
reflecting
from
his
bare
shins
with
worry
in
his
heart
the
father
went
back
to
bed
and
he
came
back
after
an
hour
he
came
back
after
two
hours
looked
through
the
small
window
saw
siddhartha
standing
in
the
moon
light
by
the
light
of
the
stars
in
the
darkness
and
he
came
back
hour
after
hour
silently
he
looked
into
the
chamber
saw
him
standing
in
the
same
place
filled
his
heart
with
anger
filled
his
heart
with
unrest
filled
his
heart
with
anguish
filled
it
with
sadness
and
in
the
night
last
hour
before
the
day
began
he
returned
stepped
into
the
room
saw
the
young
man
standing
there
who
seemed
tall
and
like
a
stranger
to
him
siddhartha
he
spoke
what
are
you
waiting
for
you
know
what
will
you
always
stand
that
way
and
wait
until
it
becomes
morning
noon
and
evening
i
will
stand
and
wait
you
will
become
tired
siddhartha
i
will
become
tired
you
will
fall
asleep
siddhartha
i
will
not
fall
asleep
you
will
die
siddhartha
i
will
die
and
would
you
rather
die
than
obey
your
father
siddhartha
has
always
obeyed
his
father
so
will
you
abandon
your
plan
siddhartha
will
do
what
his
father
will
tell
him
to
do
the
first
light
of
day
shone
into
the
room
the
brahman
saw
that
siddhartha
was
trembling
softly
in
his
knees
in
siddhartha
face
he
saw
no
trembling
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
distant
spot
then
his
father
realized
that
even
now
siddhartha
no
longer
dwelt
with
him
in
his
home
that
he
had
already
left
him
the
father
touched
siddhartha
shoulder
you
will
he
spoke
go
into
the
forest
and
be
a
samana
when
you
have
found
blissfulness
in
the
forest
then
come
back
and
teach
me
to
be
blissful
if
you
find
disappointment
then
return
and
let
us
once
again
make
offerings
to
the
gods
together
go
now
and
kiss
your
mother
tell
her
where
you
are
going
to
but
for
me
it
is
time
to
go
to
the
river
and
to
perform
the
first
ablution
he
took
his
hand
from
the
shoulder
of
his
son
and
went
outside
siddhartha
wavered
to
the
side
as
he
tried
to
walk
he
put
his
limbs
back
under
control
bowed
to
his
father
and
went
to
his
mother
to
do
as
his
father
had
said
as
he
slowly
left
on
stiff
legs
in
the
first
light
of
day
the
still
quiet
town
a
shadow
rose
near
the
last
hut
who
had
crouched
there
and
joined
the
pilgrim
govinda
you
have
come
said
siddhartha
and
smiled
i
have
come
said
govinda
with
the
samanas
in
the
evening
of
this
day
they
caught
up
with
the
ascetics
the
skinny
samanas
and
offered
them
their
companionship
and
obedience
they
were
accepted
siddhartha
gave
his
garments
to
a
poor
brahman
in
the
street
he
wore
nothing
more
than
the
loincloth
and
the
unsown
cloak
he
ate
only
once
a
day
and
never
something
cooked
he
fasted
for
fifteen
days
he
fasted
for
days
the
flesh
waned
from
his
thighs
and
cheeks
feverish
dreams
flickered
from
his
enlarged
eyes
long
nails
grew
slowly
on
his
parched
fingers
and
a
dry
shaggy
beard
grew
on
his
chin
his
glance
turned
to
ice
when
he
encountered
women
his
mouth
twitched
with
contempt
when
he
walked
through
a
city
of
nicely
dressed
people
he
saw
merchants
trading
princes
hunting
mourners
wailing
for
their
dead
whores
offering
themselves
physicians
trying
to
help
the
sick
priests
determining
the
most
suitable
day
for
seeding
lovers
loving
mothers
nursing
their
children
and
all
of
this
was
not
worthy
of
one
look
from
his
eye
it
all
lied
it
all
stank
it
all
stank
of
lies
it
all
pretended
to
be
meaningful
and
joyful
and
beautiful
and
it
all
was
just
concealed
putrefaction
the
world
tasted
bitter
life
was
torture
a
goal
stood
before
siddhartha
a
single
goal
to
become
empty
empty
of
thirst
empty
of
wishing
empty
of
dreams
empty
of
joy
and
sorrow
dead
to
himself
not
to
be
a
self
any
more
to
find
tranquility
with
an
emptied
heard
to
be
open
to
miracles
in
unselfish
thoughts
that
was
his
goal
once
all
of
my
self
was
overcome
and
had
died
once
every
desire
and
every
urge
was
silent
in
the
heart
then
the
ultimate
part
of
me
had
to
awake
the
innermost
of
my
being
which
is
no
longer
my
self
the
great
secret
silently
siddhartha
exposed
himself
to
burning
rays
of
the
sun
directly
above
glowing
with
pain
glowing
with
thirst
and
stood
there
until
he
neither
felt
any
pain
nor
thirst
any
more
silently
he
stood
there
in
the
rainy
season
from
his
hair
the
water
was
dripping
over
freezing
shoulders
over
freezing
hips
and
legs
and
the
penitent
stood
there
until
he
could
not
feel
the
cold
in
his
shoulders
and
legs
any
more
until
they
were
silent
until
they
were
quiet
silently
he
cowered
in
the
thorny
bushes
blood
dripped
from
the
burning
skin
from
festering
wounds
dripped
pus
and
siddhartha
stayed
rigidly
stayed
motionless
until
no
blood
flowed
any
more
until
nothing
stung
any
more
until
nothing
burned
any
more
siddhartha
sat
upright
and
learned
to
breathe
sparingly
learned
to
get
along
with
only
few
breathes
learned
to
stop
breathing
he
learned
beginning
with
the
breath
to
calm
the
beat
of
his
heart
leaned
to
reduce
the
beats
of
his
heart
until
they
were
only
a
few
and
almost
none
instructed
by
the
oldest
of
the
samanas
siddhartha
practised
practised
meditation
according
to
a
new
samana
rules
a
heron
flew
over
the
bamboo
forest
and
siddhartha
accepted
the
heron
into
his
soul
flew
over
forest
and
mountains
was
a
heron
ate
fish
felt
the
pangs
of
a
heron
hunger
spoke
the
heron
croak
died
a
heron
death
a
dead
jackal
was
lying
on
the
sandy
bank
and
siddhartha
soul
slipped
inside
the
body
was
the
dead
jackal
lay
on
the
banks
got
bloated
stank
decayed
was
dismembered
by
hyaenas
was
skinned
by
vultures
turned
into
a
skeleton
turned
to
dust
was
blown
across
the
fields
and
siddhartha
soul
returned
had
died
had
decayed
was
scattered
as
dust
had
tasted
the
gloomy
intoxication
of
the
cycle
awaited
in
new
thirst
like
a
hunter
in
the
gap
where
he
could
escape
from
the
cycle
where
the
end
of
the
causes
where
an
eternity
without
suffering
began
he
killed
his
senses
he
killed
his
memory
he
slipped
out
of
his
self
into
thousands
of
other
forms
was
an
animal
was
carrion
was
stone
was
wood
was
water
and
awoke
every
time
to
find
his
old
self
again
sun
shone
or
moon
was
his
self
again
turned
round
in
the
cycle
felt
thirst
overcame
the
thirst
felt
new
thirst
siddhartha
learned
a
lot
when
he
was
with
the
samanas
many
ways
leading
away
from
the
self
he
learned
to
go
he
went
the
way
of
by
means
of
pain
through
voluntarily
suffering
and
overcoming
pain
hunger
thirst
tiredness
he
went
the
way
of
by
means
of
meditation
through
imagining
the
mind
to
be
void
of
all
conceptions
these
and
other
ways
he
learned
to
go
a
thousand
times
he
left
his
self
for
hours
and
days
he
remained
in
the
but
though
the
ways
led
away
from
the
self
their
end
nevertheless
always
led
back
to
the
self
though
siddhartha
fled
from
the
self
a
thousand
times
stayed
in
nothingness
stayed
in
the
animal
in
the
stone
the
return
was
inevitable
inescapable
was
the
hour
when
he
found
himself
back
in
the
sunshine
or
in
the
moonlight
in
the
shade
or
in
the
rain
and
was
once
again
his
self
and
siddhartha
and
again
felt
the
agony
of
the
cycle
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
by
his
side
lived
govinda
his
shadow
walked
the
same
paths
undertook
the
same
efforts
they
rarely
spoke
to
one
another
than
the
service
and
the
exercises
required
occasionally
the
two
of
them
went
through
the
villages
to
beg
for
food
for
themselves
and
their
teachers
how
do
you
think
govinda
siddhartha
spoke
one
day
while
begging
this
way
how
do
you
think
did
we
progress
did
we
reach
any
goals
govinda
answered
we
have
learned
and
we
continue
learning
you
be
a
great
samana
siddhartha
quickly
you
learned
every
exercise
often
the
old
samanas
have
admired
you
one
day
you
be
a
holy
man
oh
siddhartha
quoth
siddhartha
i
ca
help
but
feel
that
it
is
not
like
this
my
friend
what
i
learned
being
among
the
samanas
up
to
this
day
this
oh
govinda
i
could
have
learned
more
quickly
and
by
simpler
means
in
every
tavern
of
that
part
of
a
town
where
the
whorehouses
are
my
friend
among
carters
and
gamblers
i
could
have
learned
it
quoth
govinda
siddhartha
is
putting
me
on
how
could
you
have
learned
meditation
holding
your
breath
insensitivity
against
hunger
and
pain
there
among
these
wretched
people
and
siddhartha
said
quietly
as
if
he
was
talking
to
himself
what
is
meditation
what
is
leaving
one
body
what
is
fasting
what
is
holding
one
breath
it
is
fleeing
from
the
self
it
is
a
short
escape
of
the
agony
of
being
a
self
it
is
a
short
numbing
of
the
senses
against
the
pain
and
the
pointlessness
of
life
the
same
escape
the
same
short
numbing
is
what
the
driver
of
an
finds
in
the
inn
drinking
a
few
bowls
of
or
fermented
then
he
wo
feel
his
self
any
more
then
he
wo
feel
the
pains
of
life
any
more
then
he
finds
a
short
numbing
of
the
senses
when
he
falls
asleep
over
his
bowl
of
he
find
the
same
what
siddhartha
and
govinda
find
when
they
escape
their
bodies
through
long
exercises
staying
in
the
this
is
how
it
is
oh
govinda
quoth
govinda
you
say
so
oh
friend
and
yet
you
know
that
siddhartha
is
no
driver
of
an
and
a
samana
is
no
drunkard
it
true
that
a
drinker
numbs
his
senses
it
true
that
he
briefly
escapes
and
rests
but
he
return
from
the
delusion
finds
everything
to
be
unchanged
has
not
become
wiser
has
gathered
no
enlightenment
has
not
risen
several
steps
and
siddhartha
spoke
with
a
smile
i
do
not
know
i
never
been
a
drunkard
but
that
i
siddhartha
find
only
a
short
numbing
of
the
senses
in
my
exercises
and
meditations
and
that
i
am
just
as
far
removed
from
wisdom
from
salvation
as
a
child
in
the
mother
womb
this
i
know
oh
govinda
this
i
know
and
once
again
another
time
when
siddhartha
left
the
forest
together
with
govinda
to
beg
for
some
food
in
the
village
for
their
brothers
and
teachers
siddhartha
began
to
speak
and
said
what
now
oh
govinda
might
we
be
on
the
right
path
might
we
get
closer
to
enlightenment
might
we
get
closer
to
salvation
or
do
we
perhaps
live
in
a
circle
we
who
have
thought
we
were
escaping
the
cycle
quoth
govinda
we
have
learned
a
lot
siddhartha
there
is
still
much
to
learn
we
are
not
going
around
in
circles
we
are
moving
up
the
circle
is
a
spiral
we
have
already
ascended
many
a
level
siddhartha
answered
how
old
would
you
think
is
our
oldest
samana
our
venerable
teacher
quoth
govinda
our
oldest
one
might
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
and
siddhartha
he
has
lived
for
sixty
years
and
has
not
reached
the
nirvana
he
turn
seventy
and
eighty
and
you
and
me
we
will
grow
just
as
old
and
will
do
our
exercises
and
will
fast
and
will
meditate
but
we
will
not
reach
the
nirvana
he
wo
and
we
wo
oh
govinda
i
believe
out
of
all
the
samanas
out
there
perhaps
not
a
single
one
not
a
single
one
will
reach
the
nirvana
we
find
comfort
we
find
numbness
we
learn
feats
to
deceive
others
but
the
most
important
thing
the
path
of
paths
we
will
not
find
if
you
only
spoke
govinda
would
speak
such
terrible
words
siddhartha
how
could
it
be
that
among
so
many
learned
men
among
so
many
brahmans
among
so
many
austere
and
venerable
samanas
among
so
many
who
are
searching
so
many
who
are
eagerly
trying
so
many
holy
men
no
one
will
find
the
path
of
paths
but
siddhartha
said
in
a
voice
which
contained
just
as
much
sadness
as
mockery
with
a
quiet
a
slightly
sad
a
slightly
mocking
voice
soon
govinda
your
friend
will
leave
the
path
of
the
samanas
he
has
walked
along
your
side
for
so
long
i
suffering
of
thirst
oh
govinda
and
on
this
long
path
of
a
samana
my
thirst
has
remained
as
strong
as
ever
i
always
thirsted
for
knowledge
i
have
always
been
full
of
questions
i
have
asked
the
brahmans
year
after
year
and
i
have
asked
the
holy
vedas
year
after
year
and
i
have
asked
the
devote
samanas
year
after
year
perhaps
oh
govinda
it
had
been
just
as
well
had
been
just
as
smart
and
just
as
profitable
if
i
had
asked
the
or
the
chimpanzee
it
took
me
a
long
time
and
am
not
finished
learning
this
yet
oh
govinda
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
there
is
indeed
no
such
thing
so
i
believe
as
what
we
refer
to
as
there
is
oh
my
friend
just
one
knowledge
this
is
everywhere
this
is
atman
this
is
within
me
and
within
you
and
within
every
creature
and
so
starting
to
believe
that
this
knowledge
has
no
worser
enemy
than
the
desire
to
know
it
than
learning
at
this
govinda
stopped
on
the
path
rose
his
hands
and
spoke
if
you
siddhartha
only
would
not
bother
your
friend
with
this
kind
of
talk
truly
you
words
stir
up
fear
in
my
heart
and
just
consider
what
would
become
of
the
sanctity
of
prayer
what
of
the
venerability
of
the
brahmans
caste
what
of
the
holiness
of
the
samanas
if
it
was
as
you
say
if
there
was
no
learning
what
oh
siddhartha
what
would
then
become
of
all
of
this
what
is
holy
what
is
precious
what
is
venerable
on
earth
and
govinda
mumbled
a
verse
to
himself
a
verse
from
an
upanishad
he
who
ponderingly
of
a
purified
spirit
loses
himself
in
the
meditation
of
atman
unexpressable
by
words
is
his
blissfulness
of
his
heart
but
siddhartha
remained
silent
he
thought
about
the
words
which
govinda
had
said
to
him
and
thought
the
words
through
to
their
end
yes
he
thought
standing
there
with
his
head
low
what
would
remain
of
all
that
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
holy
what
remains
what
can
stand
the
test
and
he
shook
his
head
at
one
time
when
the
two
young
men
had
lived
among
the
samanas
for
about
three
years
and
had
shared
their
exercises
some
news
a
rumour
a
myth
reached
them
after
being
retold
many
times
a
man
had
appeared
gotama
by
name
the
exalted
one
the
buddha
he
had
overcome
the
suffering
of
the
world
in
himself
and
had
halted
the
cycle
of
rebirths
he
was
said
to
wander
through
the
land
teaching
surrounded
by
disciples
without
possession
without
home
without
a
wife
in
the
yellow
cloak
of
an
ascetic
but
with
a
cheerful
brow
a
man
of
bliss
and
brahmans
and
princes
would
bow
down
before
him
and
would
become
his
students
this
myth
this
rumour
this
legend
resounded
its
fragrants
rose
up
here
and
there
in
the
towns
the
brahmans
spoke
of
it
and
in
the
forest
the
samanas
again
and
again
the
name
of
gotama
the
buddha
reached
the
ears
of
the
young
men
with
good
and
with
bad
talk
with
praise
and
with
defamation
it
was
as
if
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
a
country
and
news
had
been
spreading
around
that
in
one
or
another
place
there
was
a
man
a
wise
man
a
knowledgeable
one
whose
word
and
breath
was
enough
to
heal
everyone
who
had
been
infected
with
the
pestilence
and
as
such
news
would
go
through
the
land
and
everyone
would
talk
about
it
many
would
believe
many
would
doubt
but
many
would
get
on
their
way
as
soon
as
possible
to
seek
the
wise
man
the
helper
just
like
this
this
myth
ran
through
the
land
that
fragrant
myth
of
gotama
the
buddha
the
wise
man
of
the
family
of
sakya
he
possessed
so
the
believers
said
the
highest
enlightenment
he
remembered
his
previous
lives
he
had
reached
the
nirvana
and
never
returned
into
the
cycle
was
never
again
submerged
in
the
murky
river
of
physical
forms
many
wonderful
and
unbelievable
things
were
reported
of
him
he
had
performed
miracles
had
overcome
the
devil
had
spoken
to
the
gods
but
his
enemies
and
disbelievers
said
this
gotama
was
a
vain
seducer
he
would
spent
his
days
in
luxury
scorned
the
offerings
was
without
learning
and
knew
neither
exercises
nor
the
myth
of
buddha
sounded
sweet
the
scent
of
magic
flowed
from
these
reports
after
all
the
world
was
sick
life
was
hard
to
bear
and
behold
here
a
source
seemed
to
spring
forth
here
a
messenger
seemed
to
call
out
comforting
mild
full
of
noble
promises
everywhere
where
the
rumour
of
buddha
was
heard
everywhere
in
the
lands
of
india
the
young
men
listened
up
felt
a
longing
felt
hope
and
among
the
brahmans
sons
of
the
towns
and
villages
every
pilgrim
and
stranger
was
welcome
when
he
brought
news
of
him
the
exalted
one
the
sakyamuni
the
myth
had
also
reached
the
samanas
in
the
forest
and
also
siddhartha
and
also
govinda
slowly
drop
by
drop
every
drop
laden
with
hope
every
drop
laden
with
doubt
they
rarely
talked
about
it
because
the
oldest
one
of
the
samanas
did
not
like
this
myth
he
had
heard
that
this
alleged
buddha
used
to
be
an
ascetic
before
and
had
lived
in
the
forest
but
had
then
turned
back
to
luxury
and
worldly
pleasures
and
he
had
no
high
opinion
of
this
gotama
oh
siddhartha
govinda
spoke
one
day
to
his
friend
today
i
was
in
the
village
and
a
brahman
invited
me
into
his
house
and
in
his
house
there
was
the
son
of
a
brahman
from
magadha
who
has
seen
the
buddha
with
his
own
eyes
and
has
heard
him
teach
verily
this
made
my
chest
ache
when
i
breathed
and
thought
to
myself
if
only
i
would
too
if
only
we
both
would
too
siddhartha
and
me
live
to
see
the
hour
when
we
will
hear
the
teachings
from
the
mouth
of
this
perfected
man
speak
friend
would
we
want
to
go
there
too
and
listen
to
the
teachings
from
the
buddha
mouth
quoth
siddhartha
always
oh
govinda
i
had
thought
govinda
would
stay
with
the
samanas
always
i
had
believed
his
goal
was
to
live
to
be
sixty
and
seventy
years
of
age
and
to
keep
on
practising
those
feats
and
exercises
which
are
becoming
a
samana
but
behold
i
had
not
known
govinda
well
enough
i
knew
little
of
his
heart
so
now
you
my
faithful
friend
want
to
take
a
new
path
and
go
there
where
the
buddha
spreads
his
teachings
quoth
govinda
you
mocking
me
mock
me
if
you
like
siddhartha
but
have
you
not
also
developed
a
desire
an
eagerness
to
hear
these
teachings
and
have
you
not
at
one
time
said
to
me
you
would
not
walk
the
path
of
the
samanas
for
much
longer
at
this
siddhartha
laughed
in
his
very
own
manner
in
which
his
voice
assumed
a
touch
of
sadness
and
a
touch
of
mockery
and
said
well
govinda
you
spoken
well
you
remembered
correctly
if
you
only
remembered
the
other
thing
as
well
you
heard
from
me
which
is
that
i
have
grown
distrustful
and
tired
against
teachings
and
learning
and
that
my
faith
in
words
which
are
brought
to
us
by
teachers
is
small
but
let
do
it
my
dear
i
am
willing
to
listen
to
these
teachings
though
in
my
heart
i
believe
that
we
already
tasted
the
best
fruit
of
these
teachings
quoth
govinda
your
willingness
delights
my
heart
but
tell
me
how
should
this
be
possible
how
should
the
gotama
teachings
even
before
we
have
heard
them
have
already
revealed
their
best
fruit
to
us
quoth
siddhartha
let
us
eat
this
fruit
and
wait
for
the
rest
oh
govinda
but
this
fruit
which
we
already
now
received
thanks
to
the
gotama
consisted
in
him
calling
us
away
from
the
samanas
whether
he
has
also
other
and
better
things
to
give
us
oh
friend
let
us
await
with
calm
hearts
on
this
very
same
day
siddhartha
informed
the
oldest
one
of
the
samanas
of
his
decision
that
he
wanted
to
leave
him
he
informed
the
oldest
one
with
all
the
courtesy
and
modesty
becoming
to
a
younger
one
and
a
student
but
the
samana
became
angry
because
the
two
young
men
wanted
to
leave
him
and
talked
loudly
and
used
crude
swearwords
govinda
was
startled
and
became
embarrassed
but
siddhartha
put
his
mouth
close
to
govinda
ear
and
whispered
to
him
now
i
want
to
show
the
old
man
that
i
learned
something
from
him
positioning
himself
closely
in
front
of
the
samana
with
a
concentrated
soul
he
captured
the
old
man
glance
with
his
glances
deprived
him
of
his
power
made
him
mute
took
away
his
free
will
subdued
him
under
his
own
will
commanded
him
to
do
silently
whatever
he
demanded
him
to
do
the
old
man
became
mute
his
eyes
became
motionless
his
will
was
paralysed
his
arms
were
hanging
down
without
power
he
had
fallen
victim
to
siddhartha
spell
but
siddhartha
thoughts
brought
the
samana
under
their
control
he
had
to
carry
out
what
they
commanded
and
thus
the
old
man
made
several
bows
performed
gestures
of
blessing
spoke
stammeringly
a
godly
wish
for
a
good
journey
and
the
young
men
returned
the
bows
with
thanks
returned
the
wish
went
on
their
way
with
salutations
on
the
way
govinda
said
oh
siddhartha
you
have
learned
more
from
the
samanas
than
i
knew
it
is
hard
it
is
very
hard
to
cast
a
spell
on
an
old
samana
truly
if
you
had
stayed
there
you
would
soon
have
learned
to
walk
on
water
i
do
not
seek
to
walk
on
water
said
siddhartha
let
old
samanas
be
content
with
such
feats
gotama
in
the
town
of
savathi
every
child
knew
the
name
of
the
exalted
buddha
and
every
house
was
prepared
to
fill
the
of
disciples
the
silently
begging
ones
near
the
town
was
favourite
place
to
stay
the
grove
of
jetavana
which
the
rich
merchant
anathapindika
an
obedient
worshipper
of
the
exalted
one
had
given
him
and
his
people
for
a
gift
all
tales
and
answers
which
the
two
young
ascetics
had
received
in
their
search
for
gotama
abode
had
pointed
them
towards
this
area
and
arriving
at
savathi
in
the
very
first
house
before
the
door
of
which
they
stopped
to
beg
food
has
been
offered
to
them
and
they
accepted
the
food
and
siddhartha
asked
the
woman
who
handed
them
the
food
we
would
like
to
know
oh
charitable
one
where
the
buddha
dwells
the
most
venerable
one
for
we
are
two
samanas
from
the
forest
and
have
come
to
see
him
the
perfected
one
and
to
hear
the
teachings
from
his
mouth
quoth
the
woman
here
you
have
truly
come
to
the
right
place
you
samanas
from
the
forest
you
should
know
in
jetavana
in
the
garden
of
anathapindika
is
where
the
exalted
one
dwells
there
you
pilgrims
shall
spent
the
night
for
there
is
enough
space
for
the
innumerable
who
flock
here
to
hear
the
teachings
from
his
mouth
this
made
govinda
happy
and
full
of
joy
he
exclaimed
well
so
thus
we
have
reached
our
destination
and
our
path
has
come
to
an
end
but
tell
us
oh
mother
of
the
pilgrims
do
you
know
him
the
buddha
have
you
seen
him
with
your
own
eyes
quoth
the
woman
many
times
i
have
seen
him
the
exalted
one
on
many
days
i
have
seen
him
walking
through
the
alleys
in
silence
wearing
his
yellow
cloak
presenting
his
in
silence
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
leaving
with
a
filled
dish
delightedly
govinda
listened
and
wanted
to
ask
and
hear
much
more
but
siddhartha
urged
him
to
walk
on
they
thanked
and
left
and
hardly
had
to
ask
for
directions
for
rather
many
pilgrims
and
monks
as
well
from
gotama
community
were
on
their
way
to
the
jetavana
and
since
they
reached
it
at
night
there
were
constant
arrivals
shouts
and
talk
of
those
who
sought
shelter
and
got
it
the
two
samanas
accustomed
to
life
in
the
forest
found
quickly
and
without
making
any
noise
a
place
to
stay
and
rested
there
until
the
morning
at
sunrise
they
saw
with
astonishment
what
a
large
crowd
of
believers
and
curious
people
had
spent
the
night
here
on
all
paths
of
the
marvellous
grove
monks
walked
in
yellow
robes
under
the
trees
they
sat
here
and
there
in
deep
contemplation
or
in
a
conversation
about
spiritual
matters
the
shady
gardens
looked
like
a
city
full
of
people
bustling
like
bees
the
majority
of
the
monks
went
out
with
their
to
collect
food
in
town
for
their
lunch
the
only
meal
of
the
day
the
buddha
himself
the
enlightened
one
was
also
in
the
habit
of
taking
this
walk
to
beg
in
the
morning
siddhartha
saw
him
and
he
instantly
recognised
him
as
if
a
god
had
pointed
him
out
to
him
he
saw
him
a
simple
man
in
a
yellow
robe
bearing
the
in
his
hand
walking
silently
look
here
siddhartha
said
quietly
to
govinda
this
one
is
the
buddha
attentively
govinda
looked
at
the
monk
in
the
yellow
robe
who
seemed
to
be
in
no
way
different
from
the
hundreds
of
other
monks
and
soon
govinda
also
realized
this
is
the
one
and
they
followed
him
and
observed
him
the
buddha
went
on
his
way
modestly
and
deep
in
his
thoughts
his
calm
face
was
neither
happy
nor
sad
it
seemed
to
smile
quietly
and
inwardly
with
a
hidden
smile
quiet
calm
somewhat
resembling
a
healthy
child
the
buddha
walked
wore
the
robe
and
placed
his
feet
just
as
all
of
his
monks
did
according
to
a
precise
rule
but
his
face
and
his
walk
his
quietly
lowered
glance
his
quietly
dangling
hand
and
even
every
finger
of
his
quietly
dangling
hand
expressed
peace
expressed
perfection
did
not
search
did
not
imitate
breathed
softly
in
an
unwhithering
calm
in
an
unwhithering
light
an
untouchable
peace
thus
gotama
walked
towards
the
town
to
collect
alms
and
the
two
samanas
recognised
him
solely
by
the
perfection
of
his
calm
by
the
quietness
of
his
appearance
in
which
there
was
no
searching
no
desire
no
imitation
no
effort
to
be
seen
only
light
and
peace
today
we
hear
the
teachings
from
his
mouth
said
govinda
siddhartha
did
not
answer
he
felt
little
curiosity
for
the
teachings
he
did
not
believe
that
they
would
teach
him
anything
new
but
he
had
just
as
govinda
had
heard
the
contents
of
this
buddha
teachings
again
and
again
though
these
reports
only
represented
or
information
but
attentively
he
looked
at
gotama
head
his
shoulders
his
feet
his
quietly
dangling
hand
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
every
joint
of
every
finger
of
this
hand
was
of
these
teachings
spoke
of
breathed
of
exhaled
the
fragrant
of
glistened
of
truth
this
man
this
buddha
was
truthful
down
to
the
gesture
of
his
last
finger
this
man
was
holy
never
before
siddhartha
had
venerated
a
person
so
much
never
before
he
had
loved
a
person
as
much
as
this
one
they
both
followed
the
buddha
until
they
reached
the
town
and
then
returned
in
silence
for
they
themselves
intended
to
abstain
from
on
this
day
they
saw
gotama
returning
what
he
ate
could
not
even
have
satisfied
a
bird
appetite
and
they
saw
him
retiring
into
the
shade
of
the
but
in
the
evening
when
the
heat
cooled
down
and
everyone
in
the
camp
started
to
bustle
about
and
gathered
around
they
heard
the
buddha
teaching
they
heard
his
voice
and
it
was
also
perfected
was
of
perfect
calmness
was
full
of
peace
gotama
taught
the
teachings
of
suffering
of
the
origin
of
suffering
of
the
way
to
relieve
suffering
calmly
and
clearly
his
quiet
speech
flowed
on
suffering
was
life
full
of
suffering
was
the
world
but
salvation
from
suffering
had
been
found
salvation
was
obtained
by
him
who
would
walk
the
path
of
the
buddha
with
a
soft
yet
firm
voice
the
exalted
one
spoke
taught
the
four
main
doctrines
taught
the
eightfold
path
patiently
he
went
the
usual
path
of
the
teachings
of
the
examples
of
the
repetitions
brightly
and
quietly
his
voice
hovered
over
the
listeners
like
a
light
like
a
starry
sky
when
the
buddha
night
had
already
fallen
ended
his
speech
many
a
pilgrim
stepped
forward
and
asked
to
accepted
into
the
community
sought
refuge
in
the
teachings
and
gotama
accepted
them
by
speaking
you
have
heard
the
teachings
well
it
has
come
to
you
well
thus
join
us
and
walk
in
holiness
to
put
an
end
to
all
suffering
behold
then
govinda
the
shy
one
also
stepped
forward
and
spoke
i
also
take
my
refuge
in
the
exalted
one
and
his
teachings
and
he
asked
to
accepted
into
the
community
of
his
disciples
and
was
accepted
right
afterwards
when
the
buddha
had
retired
for
the
night
govinda
turned
to
siddhartha
and
spoke
eagerly
siddhartha
it
is
not
my
place
to
scold
you
we
have
both
heard
the
exalted
one
we
have
both
perceived
the
teachings
govinda
has
heard
the
teachings
he
has
taken
refuge
in
it
but
you
my
honoured
friend
do
you
also
want
to
walk
the
path
of
salvation
would
you
want
to
hesitate
do
you
want
to
wait
any
longer
siddhartha
awakened
as
if
he
had
been
asleep
when
he
heard
words
for
a
long
time
he
looked
into
govinda
face
then
he
spoke
quietly
in
a
voice
without
mockery
govinda
my
friend
now
you
have
taken
this
step
now
you
have
chosen
this
path
always
oh
govinda
you
been
my
friend
you
always
walked
one
step
behind
me
often
i
have
thought
wo
govinda
for
once
also
take
a
step
by
himself
without
me
out
of
his
own
soul
behold
now
you
turned
into
a
man
and
are
choosing
your
path
for
yourself
i
wish
that
you
would
go
it
up
to
its
end
oh
my
friend
that
you
shall
find
salvation
govinda
not
completely
understanding
it
yet
repeated
his
question
in
an
impatient
tone
speak
up
i
beg
you
my
dear
tell
me
since
it
could
not
be
any
other
way
that
you
also
my
learned
friend
will
take
your
refuge
with
the
exalted
buddha
siddhartha
placed
his
hand
on
govinda
shoulder
you
failed
to
hear
my
good
wish
for
you
oh
govinda
i
repeating
it
i
wish
that
you
would
go
this
path
up
to
its
end
that
you
shall
find
salvation
in
this
moment
govinda
realized
that
his
friend
had
left
him
and
he
started
to
weep
siddhartha
he
exclaimed
lamentingly
siddhartha
kindly
spoke
to
him
do
forget
govinda
that
you
are
now
one
of
the
samanas
of
the
buddha
you
have
renounced
your
home
and
your
parents
renounced
your
birth
and
possessions
renounced
your
free
will
renounced
all
friendship
this
is
what
the
teachings
require
this
is
what
the
exalted
one
wants
this
is
what
you
wanted
for
yourself
tomorrow
oh
govinda
i
leave
you
for
a
long
time
the
friends
continued
walking
in
the
grove
for
a
long
time
they
lay
there
and
found
no
sleep
and
over
and
over
again
govinda
urged
his
friend
he
should
tell
him
why
he
would
not
want
to
seek
refuge
in
gotama
teachings
what
fault
he
would
find
in
these
teachings
but
siddhartha
turned
him
away
every
time
and
said
be
content
govinda
very
good
are
the
teachings
of
the
exalted
one
how
could
i
find
a
fault
in
them
very
early
in
the
morning
a
follower
of
buddha
one
of
his
oldest
monks
went
through
the
garden
and
called
all
those
to
him
who
had
as
novices
taken
their
refuge
in
the
teachings
to
dress
them
up
in
the
yellow
robe
and
to
instruct
them
in
the
first
teachings
and
duties
of
their
position
then
govinda
broke
loose
embraced
once
again
his
childhood
friend
and
left
with
the
novices
but
siddhartha
walked
through
the
grove
lost
in
thought
then
he
happened
to
meet
gotama
the
exalted
one
and
when
he
greeted
him
with
respect
and
the
buddha
glance
was
so
full
of
kindness
and
calm
the
young
man
summoned
his
courage
and
asked
the
venerable
one
for
the
permission
to
talk
to
him
silently
the
exalted
one
nodded
his
approval
quoth
siddhartha
yesterday
oh
exalted
one
i
had
been
privileged
to
hear
your
wondrous
teachings
together
with
my
friend
i
had
come
from
afar
to
hear
your
teachings
and
now
my
friend
is
going
to
stay
with
your
people
he
has
taken
his
refuge
with
you
but
i
will
again
start
on
my
pilgrimage
as
you
please
the
venerable
one
spoke
politely
too
bold
is
my
speech
siddhartha
continued
but
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
exalted
one
without
having
honestly
told
him
my
thoughts
does
it
please
the
venerable
one
to
listen
to
me
for
one
moment
longer
silently
the
buddha
nodded
his
approval
quoth
siddhartha
one
thing
oh
most
venerable
one
i
have
admired
in
your
teachings
most
of
all
everything
in
your
teachings
is
perfectly
clear
is
proven
you
are
presenting
the
world
as
a
perfect
chain
a
chain
which
is
never
and
nowhere
broken
an
eternal
chain
the
links
of
which
are
causes
and
effects
never
before
this
has
been
seen
so
clearly
never
before
this
has
been
presented
so
irrefutably
truly
the
heart
of
every
brahman
has
to
beat
stronger
with
love
once
he
has
seen
the
world
through
your
teachings
perfectly
connected
without
gaps
clear
as
a
crystal
not
depending
on
chance
not
depending
on
gods
whether
it
may
be
good
or
bad
whether
living
according
to
it
would
be
suffering
or
joy
i
do
not
wish
to
discuss
possibly
this
is
not
essential
but
the
uniformity
of
the
world
that
everything
which
happens
is
connected
that
the
great
and
the
small
things
are
all
encompassed
by
the
same
forces
of
time
by
the
same
law
of
causes
of
coming
into
being
and
of
dying
this
is
what
shines
brightly
out
of
your
exalted
teachings
oh
perfected
one
but
according
to
your
very
own
teachings
this
unity
and
necessary
sequence
of
all
things
is
nevertheless
broken
in
one
place
through
a
small
gap
this
world
of
unity
is
invaded
by
something
alien
something
new
something
which
had
not
been
there
before
and
which
can
not
be
demonstrated
and
can
not
be
proven
these
are
your
teachings
of
overcoming
the
world
of
salvation
but
with
this
small
gap
with
this
small
breach
the
entire
eternal
and
uniform
law
of
the
world
is
breaking
apart
again
and
becomes
void
please
forgive
me
for
expressing
this
objection
quietly
gotama
had
listened
to
him
unmoved
now
he
spoke
the
perfected
one
with
his
kind
with
his
polite
and
clear
voice
heard
the
teachings
oh
son
of
a
brahman
and
good
for
you
that
thought
about
it
thus
deeply
you
found
a
gap
in
it
an
error
you
should
think
about
this
further
but
be
warned
oh
seeker
of
knowledge
of
the
thicket
of
opinions
and
of
arguing
about
words
there
is
nothing
to
opinions
they
may
be
beautiful
or
ugly
smart
or
foolish
everyone
can
support
them
or
discard
them
but
the
teachings
you
heard
from
me
are
no
opinion
and
their
goal
is
not
to
explain
the
world
to
those
who
seek
knowledge
they
have
a
different
goal
their
goal
is
salvation
from
suffering
this
is
what
gotama
teaches
nothing
else
i
wish
that
you
oh
exalted
one
would
not
be
angry
with
me
said
the
young
man
i
have
not
spoken
to
you
like
this
to
argue
with
you
to
argue
about
words
you
are
truly
right
there
is
little
to
opinions
but
let
me
say
this
one
more
thing
i
have
not
doubted
in
you
for
a
single
moment
i
have
not
doubted
for
a
single
moment
that
you
are
buddha
that
you
have
reached
the
goal
the
highest
goal
towards
which
so
many
thousands
of
brahmans
and
sons
of
brahmans
are
on
their
way
you
have
found
salvation
from
death
it
has
come
to
you
in
the
course
of
your
own
search
on
your
own
path
through
thoughts
through
meditation
through
realizations
through
enlightenment
it
has
not
come
to
you
by
means
of
teachings
and
thus
is
my
thought
oh
exalted
one
nobody
will
obtain
salvation
by
means
of
teachings
you
will
not
be
able
to
convey
and
say
to
anybody
oh
venerable
one
in
words
and
through
teachings
what
has
happened
to
you
in
the
hour
of
enlightenment
the
teachings
of
the
enlightened
buddha
contain
much
it
teaches
many
to
live
righteously
to
avoid
evil
but
there
is
one
thing
which
these
so
clear
these
so
venerable
teachings
do
not
contain
they
do
not
contain
the
mystery
of
what
the
exalted
one
has
experienced
for
himself
he
alone
among
hundreds
of
thousands
this
is
what
i
have
thought
and
realized
when
i
have
heard
the
teachings
this
is
why
i
am
continuing
my
travels
not
to
seek
other
better
teachings
for
i
know
there
are
none
but
to
depart
from
all
teachings
and
all
teachers
and
to
reach
my
goal
by
myself
or
to
die
but
often
i
think
of
this
day
oh
exalted
one
and
of
this
hour
when
my
eyes
beheld
a
holy
man
the
buddha
eyes
quietly
looked
to
the
ground
quietly
in
perfect
equanimity
his
inscrutable
face
was
smiling
i
wish
the
venerable
one
spoke
slowly
that
your
thoughts
shall
not
be
in
error
that
you
shall
reach
the
goal
but
tell
me
have
you
seen
the
multitude
of
my
samanas
my
many
brothers
who
have
taken
refuge
in
the
teachings
and
do
you
believe
oh
stranger
oh
samana
do
you
believe
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
all
the
abandon
the
teachings
and
to
return
into
the
life
the
world
and
of
desires
far
is
such
a
thought
from
my
mind
exclaimed
siddhartha
i
wish
that
they
shall
all
stay
with
the
teachings
that
they
shall
reach
their
goal
it
is
not
my
place
to
judge
another
person
life
only
for
myself
for
myself
alone
i
must
decide
i
must
chose
i
must
refuse
salvation
from
the
self
is
what
we
samanas
search
for
oh
exalted
one
if
i
merely
were
one
of
your
disciples
oh
venerable
one
i
fear
that
it
might
happen
to
me
that
only
seemingly
only
deceptively
my
self
would
be
calm
and
be
redeemed
but
that
in
truth
it
would
live
on
and
grow
for
then
i
had
replaced
my
self
with
the
teachings
my
duty
to
follow
you
my
love
for
you
and
the
community
of
the
monks
with
half
of
a
smile
with
an
unwavering
openness
and
kindness
gotama
looked
into
the
stranger
eyes
and
bid
him
to
leave
with
a
hardly
noticeable
gesture
you
are
wise
oh
samana
the
venerable
one
spoke
you
know
how
to
talk
wisely
my
friend
be
aware
of
too
much
wisdom
the
buddha
turned
away
and
his
glance
and
half
of
a
smile
remained
forever
etched
in
siddhartha
memory
i
have
never
before
seen
a
person
glance
and
smile
sit
and
walk
this
way
he
thought
truly
i
wish
to
be
able
to
glance
and
smile
sit
and
walk
this
way
too
thus
free
thus
venerable
thus
concealed
thus
open
thus
and
mysterious
truly
only
a
person
who
has
succeeded
in
reaching
the
innermost
part
of
his
self
would
glance
and
walk
this
way
well
so
i
also
will
seek
to
reach
the
innermost
part
of
my
self
i
saw
a
man
siddhartha
thought
a
single
man
before
whom
i
would
have
to
lower
my
glance
i
do
not
want
to
lower
my
glance
before
any
other
not
before
any
other
no
teachings
will
entice
me
any
more
since
this
man
teachings
have
not
enticed
me
i
am
deprived
by
the
buddha
thought
siddhartha
i
am
deprived
and
even
more
he
has
given
to
me
he
has
deprived
me
of
my
friend
the
one
who
had
believed
in
me
and
now
believes
in
him
who
had
been
my
shadow
and
is
now
gotama
shadow
but
he
has
given
me
siddhartha
myself
awakening
when
siddhartha
left
the
grove
where
the
buddha
the
perfected
one
stayed
behind
where
govinda
stayed
behind
then
he
felt
that
in
this
grove
his
past
life
also
stayed
behind
and
parted
from
him
he
pondered
about
this
sensation
which
filled
him
completely
as
he
was
slowly
walking
along
he
pondered
deeply
like
diving
into
a
deep
water
he
let
himself
sink
down
to
the
ground
of
the
sensation
down
to
the
place
where
the
causes
lie
because
to
identify
the
causes
so
it
seemed
to
him
is
the
very
essence
of
thinking
and
by
this
alone
sensations
turn
into
realizations
and
are
not
lost
but
become
entities
and
start
to
emit
like
rays
of
light
what
is
inside
of
them
slowly
walking
along
siddhartha
pondered
he
realized
that
he
was
no
youth
any
more
but
had
turned
into
a
man
he
realized
that
one
thing
had
left
him
as
a
snake
is
left
by
its
old
skin
that
one
thing
no
longer
existed
in
him
which
had
accompanied
him
throughout
his
youth
and
used
to
be
a
part
of
him
the
wish
to
have
teachers
and
to
listen
to
teachings
he
had
also
left
the
last
teacher
who
had
appeared
on
his
path
even
him
the
highest
and
wisest
teacher
the
most
holy
one
buddha
he
had
left
him
had
to
part
with
him
was
not
able
to
accept
his
teachings
slower
he
walked
along
in
his
thoughts
and
asked
himself
but
what
is
this
what
you
have
sought
to
learn
from
teachings
and
from
teachers
and
what
they
who
have
taught
you
much
were
still
unable
to
teach
you
and
he
found
it
was
the
self
the
purpose
and
essence
of
which
i
sought
to
learn
it
was
the
self
i
wanted
to
free
myself
from
which
i
sought
to
overcome
but
i
was
not
able
to
overcome
it
could
only
deceive
it
could
only
flee
from
it
only
hide
from
it
truly
no
thing
in
this
world
has
kept
my
thoughts
thus
busy
as
this
my
very
own
self
this
mystery
of
me
being
alive
of
me
being
one
and
being
separated
and
isolated
from
all
others
of
me
being
siddhartha
and
there
is
no
thing
in
this
world
i
know
less
about
than
about
me
about
siddhartha
having
been
pondering
while
slowly
walking
along
he
now
stopped
as
these
thoughts
caught
hold
of
him
and
right
away
another
thought
sprang
forth
from
these
a
new
thought
which
was
that
i
know
nothing
about
myself
that
siddhartha
has
remained
thus
alien
and
unknown
to
me
stems
from
one
cause
a
single
cause
i
was
afraid
of
myself
i
was
fleeing
from
myself
i
searched
atman
i
searched
brahman
i
was
willing
to
dissect
my
self
and
peel
off
all
of
its
layers
to
find
the
core
of
all
peels
in
its
unknown
interior
the
atman
life
the
divine
part
the
ultimate
part
but
i
have
lost
myself
in
the
process
siddhartha
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
a
smile
filled
his
face
and
a
feeling
of
awakening
from
long
dreams
flowed
through
him
from
his
head
down
to
his
toes
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
walked
again
walked
quickly
like
a
man
who
knows
what
he
has
got
to
do
oh
he
thought
taking
a
deep
breath
now
i
would
not
let
siddhartha
escape
from
me
again
no
longer
i
want
to
begin
my
thoughts
and
my
life
with
atman
and
with
the
suffering
of
the
world
i
do
not
want
to
kill
and
dissect
myself
any
longer
to
find
a
secret
behind
the
ruins
neither
shall
teach
me
any
more
nor
nor
the
ascetics
nor
any
kind
of
teachings
i
want
to
learn
from
myself
want
to
be
my
student
want
to
get
to
know
myself
the
secret
of
siddhartha
he
looked
around
as
if
he
was
seeing
the
world
for
the
first
time
beautiful
was
the
world
colourful
was
the
world
strange
and
mysterious
was
the
world
here
was
blue
here
was
yellow
here
was
green
the
sky
and
the
river
flowed
the
forest
and
the
mountains
were
rigid
all
of
it
was
beautiful
all
of
it
was
mysterious
and
magical
and
in
its
midst
was
he
siddhartha
the
awakening
one
on
the
path
to
himself
all
of
this
all
this
yellow
and
blue
river
and
forest
entered
siddhartha
for
the
first
time
through
the
eyes
was
no
longer
a
spell
of
mara
was
no
longer
the
veil
of
maya
was
no
longer
a
pointless
and
coincidental
diversity
of
mere
appearances
despicable
to
the
deeply
thinking
brahman
who
scorns
diversity
who
seeks
unity
blue
was
blue
river
was
river
and
if
also
in
the
blue
and
the
river
in
siddhartha
the
singular
and
divine
lived
hidden
so
it
was
still
that
very
divinity
way
and
purpose
to
be
here
yellow
here
blue
there
sky
there
forest
and
here
siddhartha
the
purpose
and
the
essential
properties
were
not
somewhere
behind
the
things
they
were
in
them
in
everything
how
deaf
and
stupid
have
i
been
he
thought
walking
swiftly
along
when
someone
reads
a
text
wants
to
discover
its
meaning
he
will
not
scorn
the
symbols
and
letters
and
call
them
deceptions
coincidence
and
worthless
hull
but
he
will
read
them
he
will
study
and
love
them
letter
by
letter
but
i
who
wanted
to
read
the
book
of
the
world
and
the
book
of
my
own
being
i
have
for
the
sake
of
a
meaning
i
had
anticipated
before
i
read
scorned
the
symbols
and
letters
i
called
the
visible
world
a
deception
called
my
eyes
and
my
tongue
coincidental
and
worthless
forms
without
substance
no
this
is
over
i
have
awakened
i
have
indeed
awakened
and
have
not
been
born
before
this
very
day
in
thinking
these
thoughts
siddhartha
stopped
once
again
suddenly
as
if
there
was
a
snake
lying
in
front
of
him
on
the
path
because
suddenly
he
had
also
become
aware
of
this
he
who
was
indeed
like
someone
who
had
just
woken
up
or
like
a
baby
he
had
to
start
his
life
anew
and
start
again
at
the
very
beginning
when
he
had
left
in
this
very
morning
from
the
grove
jetavana
the
grove
of
that
exalted
one
already
awakening
already
on
the
path
towards
himself
he
had
every
intention
regarded
as
natural
and
took
for
granted
that
he
after
years
as
an
ascetic
would
return
to
his
home
and
his
father
but
now
only
in
this
moment
when
he
stopped
as
if
a
snake
was
lying
on
his
path
he
also
awoke
to
this
realization
but
i
am
no
longer
the
one
i
was
i
am
no
ascetic
any
more
i
am
not
a
priest
any
more
i
am
no
brahman
any
more
whatever
should
i
do
at
home
and
at
my
place
study
make
offerings
practise
meditation
but
all
this
is
over
all
of
this
is
no
longer
alongside
my
path
motionless
siddhartha
remained
standing
there
and
for
the
time
of
one
moment
and
breath
his
heart
felt
cold
he
felt
a
cold
in
his
chest
as
a
small
animal
a
bird
or
a
rabbit
would
when
seeing
how
alone
he
was
for
many
years
he
had
been
without
home
and
had
felt
nothing
now
he
felt
it
still
even
in
the
deepest
meditation
he
had
been
his
father
son
had
been
a
brahman
of
a
high
caste
a
cleric
now
he
was
nothing
but
siddhartha
the
awoken
one
nothing
else
was
left
deeply
he
inhaled
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
cold
and
shivered
nobody
was
thus
alone
as
he
was
there
was
no
nobleman
who
did
not
belong
to
the
noblemen
no
worker
that
did
not
belong
to
the
workers
and
found
refuge
with
them
shared
their
life
spoke
their
language
no
brahman
who
would
not
be
regarded
as
brahmans
and
lived
with
them
no
ascetic
who
would
not
find
his
refuge
in
the
caste
of
the
samanas
and
even
the
most
forlorn
hermit
in
the
forest
was
not
just
one
and
alone
he
was
also
surrounded
by
a
place
he
belonged
to
he
also
belonged
to
a
caste
in
which
he
was
at
home
govinda
had
become
a
monk
and
a
thousand
monks
were
his
brothers
wore
the
same
robe
as
he
believed
in
his
faith
spoke
his
language
but
he
siddhartha
where
did
he
belong
to
with
whom
would
he
share
his
life
whose
language
would
he
speak
out
of
this
moment
when
the
world
melted
away
all
around
him
when
he
stood
alone
like
a
star
in
the
sky
out
of
this
moment
of
a
cold
and
despair
siddhartha
emerged
more
a
self
than
before
more
firmly
concentrated
he
felt
this
had
been
the
last
tremor
of
the
awakening
the
last
struggle
of
this
birth
and
it
was
not
long
until
he
walked
again
in
long
strides
started
to
proceed
swiftly
and
impatiently
heading
no
longer
for
home
no
longer
to
his
father
no
longer
back
second
part
dedicated
to
wilhelm
gundert
my
cousin
in
japan
kamala
siddhartha
learned
something
new
on
every
step
of
his
path
for
the
world
was
transformed
and
his
heart
was
enchanted
he
saw
the
sun
rising
over
the
mountains
with
their
forests
and
setting
over
the
distant
beach
with
its
at
night
he
saw
the
stars
in
the
sky
in
their
fixed
positions
and
the
crescent
of
the
moon
floating
like
a
boat
in
the
blue
he
saw
trees
stars
animals
clouds
rainbows
rocks
herbs
flowers
stream
and
river
the
glistening
dew
in
the
bushes
in
the
morning
distant
high
mountains
which
were
blue
and
pale
birds
sang
and
bees
wind
silverishly
blew
through
the
all
of
this
a
and
colourful
had
always
been
there
always
the
sun
and
the
moon
had
shone
always
rivers
had
roared
and
bees
had
buzzed
but
in
former
times
all
of
this
had
been
nothing
more
to
siddhartha
than
a
fleeting
deceptive
veil
before
his
eyes
looked
upon
in
distrust
destined
to
be
penetrated
and
destroyed
by
thought
since
it
was
not
the
essential
existence
since
this
essence
lay
beyond
on
the
other
side
of
the
visible
but
now
his
liberated
eyes
stayed
on
this
side
he
saw
and
became
aware
of
the
visible
sought
to
be
at
home
in
this
world
did
not
search
for
the
true
essence
did
not
aim
at
a
world
beyond
beautiful
was
this
world
looking
at
it
thus
without
searching
thus
simply
thus
childlike
beautiful
were
the
moon
and

beautiful
was
the

the

the

and

the

beautiful

to
walk
through

world
thus
childlike
thus
awoken
thus
open
to
what
is
near
thus
without
distrust
differently
the
sun
burnt
the
head
differently
the
shade
of
the
forest
cooled
him
down
differently
the
stream
and
the
cistern
the
pumpkin
and
the
banana
tasted
short
were
the
days
short
the
nights
every
hour
sped
swiftly
away
like
a
sail
on
the
sea
and
under
the
sail
was
a
ship
full
of
treasures
full
of
joy
siddhartha
saw
a
group
of
apes
moving
through
the
high
canopy
of
the
forest
high
in
the
branches
and
heard
their
savage
greedy
song
siddhartha
saw
a
male
sheep
following
a
female
one
and
mating
with
her
in
a
lake
of
reeds
he
saw
the
pike
hungrily
hunting
for
its
dinner
propelling
themselves
away
from
it
in
fear
wiggling
and
sparkling
the
young
fish
jumped
in
droves
out
of
the
water
the
scent
of
strength
and
passion
came
forcefully
out
of
the
hasty
eddies
of
the
water
which
the
pike
stirred
up
impetuously
hunting
all
of
this
had
always
existed
and
he
had
not
seen
it
he
had
not
been
with
it
now
he
was
with
it
he
was
part
of
it
light
and
shadow
ran
through
his
eyes
stars
and
moon
ran
through
his
heart
on
the
way
siddhartha
also
remembered
everything
he
had
experienced
in
the
garden
jetavana
the
teaching
he
had
heard
there
the
divine
buddha
the
farewell
from
govinda
the
conversation
with
the
exalted
one
again
he
remembered
his
own
words
he
had
spoken
to
the
exalted
one
every
word
and
with
astonishment
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
he
had
said
things
which
he
had
not
really
known
yet
at
this
time
what
he
had
said
to
gotama
his
the
buddha
treasure
and
secret
was
not
the
teachings
but
the
unexpressable
and
not
teachable
which
he
had
experienced
in
the
hour
of
his
enlightenment
it
was
nothing
but
this
very
thing
which
he
had
now
gone
to
experience
what
he
now
began
to
experience
now
he
had
to
experience
his
self
it
is
true
that
he
had
already
known
for
a
long
time
that
his
self
was
atman
in
its
essence
bearing
the
same
eternal
characteristics
as
brahman
but
never
he
had
really
found
this
self
because
he
had
wanted
to
capture
it
in
the
net
of
thought
with
the
body
definitely
not
being
the
self
and
not
the
spectacle
of
the
senses
so
it
also
was
not
the
thought
not
the
rational
mind
not
the
learned
wisdom
not
the
learned
ability
to
draw
conclusions
and
to
develop
previous
thoughts
in
to
new
ones
no
this
world
of
thought
was
also
still
on
this
side
and
nothing
could
be
achieved
by
killing
the
random
self
of
the
senses
if
the
random
self
of
thoughts
and
learned
knowledge
was
fattened
on
the
other
hand
both
the
thoughts
as
well
as
the
senses
were
pretty
things
the
ultimate
meaning
was
hidden
behind
both
of
them
both
had
to
be
listened
to
both
had
to
be
played
with
both
neither
had
to
be
scorned
nor
overestimated
from
both
the
secret
voices
of
the
innermost
truth
had
to
be
attentively
perceived
he
wanted
to
strive
for
nothing
except
for
what
the
voice
commanded
him
to
strive
for
dwell
on
nothing
except
where
the
voice
would
advise
him
to
do
so
why
had
gotama
at
that
time
in
the
hour
of
all
hours
sat
down
under
the
where
the
enlightenment
hit
him
he
had
heard
a
voice
a
voice
in
his
own
heart
which
had
commanded
him
to
seek
rest
under
this
tree
and
he
had
neither
preferred
offerings
ablutions
nor
prayer
neither
food
nor
drink
neither
sleep
nor
dream
he
had
obeyed
the
voice
to
obey
like
this
not
to
an
external
command
only
to
the
voice
to
be
ready
like
this
this
was
good
this
was
necessary
nothing
else
was
necessary
in
the
night
when
he
slept
in
the
straw
hut
of
a
ferryman
by
the
river
siddhartha
had
a
dream
govinda
was
standing
in
front
of
him
dressed
in
the
yellow
robe
of
an
ascetic
sad
was
how
govinda
looked
like
sadly
he
asked
why
have
you
forsaken
me
at
this
he
embraced
govinda
wrapped
his
arms
around
him
and
as
he
was
pulling
him
close
to
his
chest
and
kissed
him
it
was
not
govinda
any
more
but
a
woman
and
a
full
breast
popped
out
of
the
woman
dress
at
which
siddhartha
lay
and
drank
sweetly
and
strongly
tasted
the
milk
from
this
breast
it
tasted
of
woman
and
man
of
sun
and
forest
of
animal
and
flower
of
every
fruit
of
every
joyful
desire
it
intoxicated
him
and
rendered
him
when
siddhartha
woke
up
the
pale
river
shimmered
through
the
door
of
the
hut
and
in
the
forest
a
dark
call
of
an
owl
resounded
deeply
and
pleasantly
when
the
day
began
siddhartha
asked
his
host
the
ferryman
to
get
him
across
the
river
the
ferryman
got
him
across
the
river
on
his
the
wide
water
shimmered
reddishly
in
the
light
of
the
morning
this
is
a
beautiful
river
he
said
to
his
companion
yes
said
the
ferryman
a
very
beautiful
river
i
love
it
more
than
anything
often
i
have
listened
to
it
often
i
have
looked
into
its
eyes
and
always
i
have
learned
from
it
much
can
be
learned
from
a
river
i
thank
you
my
benefactor
spoke
siddhartha
disembarking
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
have
no
gift
i
could
give
you
for
your
hospitality
my
dear
and
also
no
payment
for
your
work
i
am
a
man
without
a
home
a
son
of
a
brahman
and
a
samana
i
did
see
it
spoke
the
ferryman
and
i
have
expected
any
payment
from
you
and
no
gift
which
would
be
the
custom
for
guests
to
bear
you
will
give
me
the
gift
another
time
do
you
think
so
asked
siddhartha
amusedly
surely
this
too
i
have
learned
from
the
river
everything
is
coming
back
you
too
samana
will
come
back
now
farewell
let
your
friendship
be
my
reward
commemorate
me
when
you
make
offerings
to
the
gods
smiling
they
parted
smiling
siddhartha
was
happy
about
the
friendship
and
the
kindness
of
the
ferryman
he
is
like
govinda
he
thought
with
a
smile
all
i
meet
on
my
path
are
like
govinda
all
are
thankful
though
they
are
the
ones
who
would
have
a
right
to
receive
thanks
all
are
submissive
all
would
like
to
be
friends
like
to
obey
think
little
like
children
are
all
people
at
about
noon
he
came
through
a
village
in
front
of
the
mud
cottages
children
were
rolling
about
in
the
street
were
playing
with
and
screamed
and
wrestled
but
they
all
timidly
fled
from
the
unknown
samana
in
the
end
of
the
village
the
path
led
through
a
stream
and
by
the
side
of
the
stream
a
young
woman
was
kneeling
and
washing
clothes
when
siddhartha
greeted
her
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
up
to
him
with
a
smile
so
that
he
saw
the
white
in
her
eyes
glistening
he
called
out
a
blessing
to
her
as
it
is
the
custom
among
travellers
and
asked
how
far
he
still
had
to
go
to
reach
the
large
city
then
she
got
up
and
came
to
him
beautifully
her
wet
mouth
was
shimmering
in
her
young
face
she
exchanged
humorous
banter
with
him
asked
whether
he
had
eaten
already
and
whether
it
was
true
that
the
samanas
slept
alone
in
the
forest
at
night
and
were
not
allowed
to
have
any
women
with
them
while
talking
she
put
her
left
foot
on
his
right
one
and
made
a
movement
as
a
woman
does
who
would
want
to
initiate
that
kind
of
sexual
pleasure
with
a
man
which
the
textbooks
call
climbing
a
tree
siddhartha
felt
his
blood
heating
up
and
since
in
this
moment
he
had
to
think
of
his
dream
again
he
bend
slightly
down
to
the
woman
and
kissed
with
his
lips
the
brown
nipple
of
her
breast
looking
up
he
saw
her
face
smiling
full
of
lust
and
her
eyes
with
contracted
pupils
begging
with
desire
siddhartha
also
felt
desire
and
felt
the
source
of
his
sexuality
moving
but
since
he
had
never
touched
a
woman
before
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
while
his
hands
were
already
prepared
to
reach
out
for
her
and
in
this
moment
he
heard
shuddering
with
awe
the
voice
if
his
innermost
self
and
this
voice
said
no
then
all
charms
disappeared
from
the
young
woman
smiling
face
he
no
longer
saw
anything
else
but
the
damp
glance
of
a
female
animal
in
heat
politely
he
petted
her
cheek
turned
away
from
her
and
disappeared
away
from
the
disappointed
woman
with
light
steps
into
the
on
this
day
he
reached
the
large
city
before
the
evening
and
was
happy
for
he
felt
the
need
to
be
among
people
for
a
long
time
he
had
lived
in
the
forests
and
the
straw
hut
of
the
ferryman
in
which
he
had
slept
that
night
had
been
the
first
roof
for
a
long
time
he
has
had
over
his
head
before
the
city
in
a
beautifully
fenced
grove
the
traveller
came
across
a
small
group
of
servants
both
male
and
female
carrying
baskets
in
their
midst
carried
by
four
servants
in
an
ornamental
sat
a
woman
the
mistress
on
red
pillows
under
a
colourful
canopy
siddhartha
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
and
watched
the
parade
saw
the
servants
the
maids
the
baskets
saw
the
and
saw
the
lady
in
it
under
black
hair
which
made
to
tower
high
on
her
head
he
saw
a
very
fair
very
delicate
very
smart
face
a
brightly
red
mouth
like
a
freshly
cracked
fig
eyebrows
which
were
well
tended
and
painted
in
a
high
arch
smart
and
watchful
dark
eyes
a
clear
tall
neck
rising
from
a
green
and
golden
garment
resting
fair
hands
long
and
thin
with
wide
golden
bracelets
over
the
wrists
siddhartha
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
and
his
heart
rejoiced
he
bowed
deeply
when
the
came
closer
and
straightening
up
again
he
looked
at
the
fair
charming
face
read
for
a
moment
in
the
smart
eyes
with
the
high
arcs
above
breathed
in
a
slight
fragrant
he
did
not
know
with
a
smile
the
beautiful
women
nodded
for
a
moment
and
disappeared
into
the
grove
and
then
the
servant
as
well
thus
i
am
entering
this
city
siddhartha
thought
with
a
charming
omen
he
instantly
felt
drawn
into
the
grove
but
he
thought
about
it
and
only
now
he
became
aware
of
how
the
servants
and
maids
had
looked
at
him
at
the
entrance
how
despicable
how
distrustful
how
rejecting
i
am
still
a
samana
he
thought
i
am
still
an
ascetic
and
beggar
i
must
not
remain
like
this
i
will
not
be
able
to
enter
the
grove
like
this
and
he
laughed
the
next
person
who
came
along
this
path
he
asked
about
the
grove
and
for
the
name
of
the
woman
and
was
told
that
this
was
the
grove
of
kamala
the
famous
courtesan
and
that
aside
from
the
grove
she
owned
a
house
in
the
city
then
he
entered
the
city
now
he
had
a
goal
pursuing
his
goal
he
allowed
the
city
to
suck
him
in
drifted
through
the
flow
of
the
streets
stood
still
on
the
squares
rested
on
the
stairs
of
stone
by
the
river
when
the
evening
came
he
made
friends
with
barber
assistant
whom
he
had
seen
working
in
the
shade
of
an
arch
in
a
building
whom
he
found
again
praying
in
a
temple
of
vishnu
whom
he
told
about
stories
of
vishnu
and
the
lakshmi
among
the
boats
by
the
river
he
slept
this
night
and
early
in
the
morning
before
the
first
customers
came
into
his
shop
he
had
the
barber
assistant
shave
his
beard
and
cut
his
hair
comb
his
hair
and
anoint
it
with
fine
oil
then
he
went
to
take
his
bath
in
the
river
when
late
in
the
afternoon
beautiful
kamala
approached
her
grove
in
her
siddhartha
was
standing
at
the
entrance
made
a
bow
and
received
the
courtesan
greeting
but
that
servant
who
walked
at
the
very
end
of
her
train
he
motioned
to
him
and
asked
him
to
inform
his
mistress
that
a
young
brahman
would
wish
to
talk
to
her
after
a
while
the
servant
returned
asked
him
who
had
been
waiting
to
follow
him
conducted
him
who
was
following
him
without
a
word
into
a
pavilion
where
kamala
was
lying
on
a
couch
and
left
him
alone
with
her
were
you
already
standing
out
there
yesterday
greeting
me
asked
kamala
it
true
that
i

and
greeted
you
yesterday
but
did
you
yesterday
wear
a
beard
and
long
hair
and
dust
in
your
hair

have
observed
well

seen
everything

have
seen
siddhartha
the
son
of
a
brahman
who
has
left
his
home
to
become
a
samana
and
who
has
been
a
samana
for
three
years
but
now
i
have
left
that
path
and
came
into
this
city
and

city

fan
of
peacocks

and
asked

to
me

i
not
mark
words
which
are
coming
from
such
a
mouth
your
mouth
is
like
a
freshly
cracked
fig
kamala
my
mouth
is
red
and
fresh
as
well
it
will
be
a
suitable
match
for
yours
you
but
tell
me
beautiful
kamala
are
you
at
all
afraid
of
the
samana
from
the
forest
who
has
come
to
learn
how
to
make
love
whatever
for
should
i
be
afraid
of
a
samana
a
stupid
samana
from
the
forest
who
is
coming
from
the
jackals
and
does
even
know
yet
what
women
are
oh
he
strong
the
samana
and
he
is
afraid
of
anything
he
could
force
you
beautiful
girl
he
could
kidnap
you
he
could
hurt
you
no
samana
i
am
not
afraid
of
this
did
any
samana
or
brahman
ever
fear
someone
might
come
and
grab
him
and
steal
his
learning
and
his
religious
devotion
and
his
depth
of
thought
no
for
they
are
his
very
own
and
he
would
only
give
away
from
those
whatever
he
is
willing
to
give
and
to
whomever
he
is
willing
to
give
like
this
it
is
precisely
like
this
it
is
also
with
kamala
and
with
the
pleasures
of
love
beautiful
and
red
is
kamala
mouth
but
just
try
to
kiss
it
against
kamala
will
and
you
will
not
obtain
a
single
drop
of
sweetness
from
it
which
knows
how
to
give
so
many
sweet
things
you
are
learning
easily
siddhartha
thus
you
should
also
learn
this
love
can
be
obtained
by
begging
buying
receiving
it
as
a
gift
finding
it
in
the
street
but
it
can
not
be
stolen
in
this
you
have
come
up
with
the
wrong
path
no
it
would
be
a
pity
if
a
pretty
young
man
like
you
would
want
to
tackle
it
in
such
a
wrong
manner
siddhartha
bowed
with
a
smile
it
would
be
a
pity
kamala
you
are
so
right
it
would
be
such
a
great
pity
no
i
shall
not
lose
a
single
drop
of
sweetness
from
your
mouth
nor
you
from
mine
so
it
is
settled
siddhartha
will
return
once
he
have
what
he
still
lacks
clothes
shoes
money
but
speak
lovely
kamala
could
you
still
give
me
one
small
advice
an
advice
why
not
who
would
like
to
give
an
advice
to
a
poor
ignorant
samana
who
is
coming
from
the
jackals
of
the
forest
dear
kamala
thus
advise
me
where
i
should
go
to
that
i
find
these
three
things
most
quickly
friend
many
would
like
to
know
this
you
must
do
what
you
learned
and
ask
for
money
clothes
and
shoes
in
return
there
is
no
other
way
for
a
poor
man
to
obtain
money
what
might
you
be
able
to
do
i
can
think
i
can
wait
i
can
fast
nothing
else
nothing
but
yes
i
can
also
write
poetry
would
you
like
to
give
me
a
kiss
for
a
poem
i
would
like
to
if
i
like
your
poem
what
would
be
its
title
siddhartha
spoke
after
he
had
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
these
verses
into
her
shady
grove
stepped
the
pretty
kamala
at
the
grove
entrance
stood
the
brown
samana
deeply
seeing
the
lotus
blossom
bowed
that
man
and
smiling
kamala
thanked
more
lovely
thought
the
young
man
than
offerings
for
gods
more
lovely
is
offering
to
pretty
kamala
kamala
loudly
clapped
her
hands
so
that
the
golden
bracelets
clanged
beautiful
are
your
verses
oh
brown
samana
and
truly
i
losing
nothing
when
i
giving
you
a
kiss
for
them
she
beckoned
him
with
her
eyes
he
tilted
his
head
so
that
his
face
touched
hers
and
placed
his
mouth
on
that
mouth
which
was
like
a
freshly
cracked
fig
for
a
long
time
kamala
kissed
him
and
with
a
deep
astonishment
siddhartha
felt
how
she
taught
him
how
wise
she
was
how
she
controlled
him
rejected
him
lured
him
and
how
after
this
first
one
there
was
to
be
a
long
a
well
ordered
well
tested
sequence
of
kisses
everyone
different
from
the
others
he
was
still
to
receive
breathing
deeply
he
remained
standing
where
he
was
and
was
in
this
moment
astonished
like
a
child
about
the
cornucopia
of
knowledge
and
things
worth
learning
which
revealed
itself
before
his
eyes
very
beautiful
are
your
verses
exclaimed
kamala
if
i
was
rich
i
would
give
you
pieces
of
gold
for
them
but
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
earn
thus
much
money
with
verses
as
you
need
for
you
need
a
lot
of
money
if
you
want
to
be
kamala
friend
the
way
you
able
to
kiss
kamala
stammered
siddhartha
yes
this
i
am
able
to
do
therefore
i
do
not
lack
clothes
shoes
bracelets
and
all
beautiful
things
but
what
will
become
of
you
are
you
able
to
do
anything
else
but
thinking
fasting
making
poetry
i
also
know
the
sacrificial
songs
said
siddhartha
but
i
do
not
want
to
sing
them
any
more
i
also
know
magic
spells
but
i
do
not
want
to
speak
them
any
more
i
have
read
the
scriptures
stop
kamala
interrupted
him
you
able
to
read
and
write
certainly
i
can
do
this
many
people
can
do
this
most
people
ca
i
also
ca
do
it
it
is
very
good
that
able
to
read
and
write
very
good
you
will
also
still
find
use
for
the
magic
spells
in
this
moment
a
maid
came
running
in
and
whispered
a
message
into
her
mistress
ear
there
a
visitor
for
me
exclaimed
kamala
hurry
and
get
yourself
away
siddhartha
nobody
may
see
you
in
here
remember
this
tomorrow
i
see
you
again
but
to
the
maid
she
gave
the
order
to
give
the
pious
brahman
white
upper
garments
without
fully
understanding
what
was
happening
to
him
siddhartha
found
himself
being
dragged
away
by
the
maid
brought
into
a
avoiding
the
direct
path
being
given
upper
garments
as
a
gift
led
into
the
bushes
and
urgently
admonished
to
get
himself
out
of
the
grove
as
soon
as
possible
without
being
seen
contently
he
did
as
he
had
been
told
being
accustomed
to
the
forest
he
managed
to
get
out
of
the
grove
and
over
the
hedge
without
making
a
sound
contently
he
returned
to
the
city
carrying
the
rolled
up
garments
under
his
arm
at
the
inn
where
travellers
stay
he
positioned
himself
by
the
door
without
words
he
asked
for
food
without
a
word
he
accepted
a
piece
of
perhaps
as
soon
as
tomorrow
he
thought
i
will
ask
no
one
for
food
any
more
suddenly
pride
flared
up
in
him
he
was
no
samana
any
more
it
was
no
longer
becoming
to
him
to
beg
he
gave
the
to
a
dog
and
remained
without
food
simple
is
the
life
which
people
lead
in
this
world
here
thought
siddhartha
it
presents
no
difficulties
everything
was
difficult
toilsome
and
ultimately
hopeless
when
i
was
still
a
samana
now
everything
is
easy
easy
like
that
lessons
in
kissing
which
kamala
is
giving
me
i
need
clothes
and
money
nothing
else
this
a
small
near
goals
they
wo
make
a
person
lose
any
sleep
he
had
already
discovered
kamala
house
in
the
city
long
before
there
he
turned
up
the
following
day
things
are
working
out
well
she
called
out
to
him
they
are
expecting
you
at
kamaswami
he
is
the
richest
merchant
of
the
city
if
he
like
you
he
accept
you
into
his
service
be
smart
brown
samana
i
had
others
tell
him
about
you
be
polite
towards
him
he
is
very
powerful
but
do
be
too
modest
i
do
not
want
you
to
become
his
servant
you
shall
become
his
equal
or
else
i
wo
be
satisfied
with
you
kamaswami
is
starting
to
get
old
and
lazy
if
he
like
you
he
entrust
you
with
a
lot
siddhartha
thanked
her
and
laughed
and
when
she
found
out
that
he
had
not
eaten
anything
yesterday
and
today
she
sent
for
bread
and
fruits
and
treated
him
to
it
you
been
lucky
she
said
when
they
parted
i
opening
one
door
after
another
for
you
how
come
do
you
have
a
spell
siddhartha
said
yesterday
i
told
you
i
knew
how
to
think
to
wait
and
to
fast
but
you
thought
this
was
of
no
use
but
it
is
useful
for
many
things
kamala
you
see
you
see
that
the
stupid
samanas
are
learning
and
able
to
do
many
pretty
things
in
the
forest
which
the
likes
of
you
are
capable
of
the
day
before
yesterday
i
was
still
a
shaggy
beggar
as
soon
as
yesterday
i
have
kissed
kamala
and
soon
be
a
merchant
and
have
money
and
all
those
things
you
insist
upon
well
yes
she
admitted
but
where
would
you
be
without
me
what
would
you
be
if
kamala
was
helping
you
dear
kamala
said
siddhartha
and
straightened
up
to
his
full
height
when
i
came
to
you
into
your
grove
i
did
the
first
step
it
was
my
resolution
to
learn
love
from
this
most
beautiful
woman
from
that
moment
on
when
i
had
made
this
resolution
i
also
knew
that
i
would
carry
it
out
i
knew
that
you
would
help
me
at
your
first
glance
at
the
entrance
of
the
grove
i
already
knew
it
but
what
if
i
had
been
willing
you
were
willing
look
kamala
when
you
throw
a
rock
into
the
water
it
will
speed
on
the
fastest
course
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
this
is
how
it
is
when
siddhartha
has
a
goal
a
resolution
siddhartha
does
nothing
he
waits
he
thinks
he
fasts
but
he
passes
through
the
things
of
the
world
like
a
rock
through
water
without
doing
anything
without
stirring
he
is
drawn
he
lets
himself
fall
his
goal
attracts
him
because
he
does
let
anything
enter
his
soul
which
might
oppose
the
goal
this
is
what
siddhartha
has
learned
among
the
samanas
this
is
what
fools
call
magic
and
of
which
they
think
it
would
be
effected
by
means
of
the
daemons
nothing
is
effected
by
daemons
there
are
no
daemons
everyone
can
perform
magic
everyone
can
reach
his
goals
if
he
is
able
to
think
if
he
is
able
to
wait
if
he
is
able
to
fast
kamala
listened
to
him
she
loved
his
voice
she
loved
the
look
from
his
eyes
perhaps
it
is
so
she
said
quietly
as
you
say
friend
but
perhaps
it
is
also
like
this
that
siddhartha
is
a
handsome
man
that
his
glance
pleases
the
women
that
therefore
good
fortune
is
coming
towards
him
with
one
kiss
siddhartha
bid
his
farewell
i
wish
that
it
should
be
this
way
my
teacher
that
my
glance
shall
please
you
that
always
good
fortune
shall
come
to
me
out
of
your
direction
with
the
childlike
people
siddhartha
went
to
kamaswami
the
merchant
he
was
directed
into
a
rich
house
servants
led
him
between
precious
carpets
into
a
chamber
where
he
awaited
the
master
of
the
house
kamaswami
entered
a
swiftly
smoothly
moving
man
with
very
gray
hair
with
very
intelligent
cautious
eyes
with
a
greedy
mouth
politely
the
host
and
the
guest
greeted
one
another
i
have
been
told
the
merchant
began
that
you
were
a
brahman
a
learned
man
but
that
you
seek
to
be
in
the
service
of
a
merchant
might
you
have
become
destitute
brahman
so
that
you
seek
to
serve
no
said
siddhartha
i
have
not
become
destitute
and
have
never
been
destitute
you
should
know
that
i
coming
from
the
samanas
with
whom
i
have
lived
for
a
long
time
if
you
coming
from
the
samanas
how
could
you
be
anything
but
destitute
are
the
samanas
entirely
without
possessions
i
am
without
possessions
said
siddhartha
if
this
is
what
you
mean
surely
i
am
without
possessions
but
i
am
so
voluntarily
and
therefore
i
am
not
destitute
but
what
are
you
planning
to
live
of
being
without
possessions
i
have
thought
of
this
yet
sir
for
more
than
three
years
i
have
been
without
possessions
and
have
never
thought
about
of
what
i
should
live
so
you
lived
of
the
possessions
of
others
presumable
this
is
how
it
is
after
all
a
merchant
also
lives
of
what
other
people
own
well
said
but
he
would
take
anything
from
another
person
for
nothing
he
would
give
his
merchandise
in
return
so
it
seems
to
be
indeed
everyone
takes
everyone
gives
such
is
life
but
if
you
do
mind
me
asking
being
without
possessions
what
would
you
like
to
give
everyone
gives
what
he
has
the
warrior
gives
strength
the
merchant
gives
merchandise
the
teacher
teachings
the
farmer
rice
the
fisher
fish
yes
indeed
and
what
is
it
now
what
you
got
to
give
what
is
it
that
you
learned
what
you
able
to
do
i
can
think
i
can
wait
i
can
fast
that
everything
i
believe
that
everything
and
what
the
use
of
that
for
example
the
fasting
what
is
it
good
for
it
is
very
good
sir
when
a
person
has
nothing
to
eat
fasting
is
the
smartest
thing
he
could
do
when
for
example
siddhartha
learned
to
fast
he
would
have
to
accept
any
kind
of
service
before
this
day
is
up
whether
it
may
be
with
you
or
wherever
because
hunger
would
force
him
to
do
so
but
like
this
siddhartha
can
wait
calmly
he
knows
no
impatience
he
knows
no
emergency
for
a
long
time
he
can
allow
hunger
to
besiege
him
and
can
laugh
about
it
this
sir
is
what
fasting
is
good
for
you
right
samana
wait
for
a
moment
kamaswami
left
the
room
and
returned
with
a
scroll
which
he
handed
to
his
guest
while
asking
can
you
read
this
siddhartha
looked
at
the
scroll
on
which
a
had
been
written
down
and
began
to
read
out
its
contents
excellent
said
kamaswami
and
would
you
write
something
for
me
on
this
piece
of
paper
he
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pen
and
siddhartha
wrote
and
returned
the
paper
kamaswami
read
writing
is
good
thinking
is
better
being
smart
is
good
being
patient
is
better
it
is
excellent
how
you
able
to
write
the
merchant
praised
him
many
a
thing
we
will
still
have
to
discuss
with
one
another
for
today
i
asking
you
to
be
my
guest
and
to
live
in
this
house
siddhartha
thanked
and
accepted
and
lived
in
the
dealers
house
from
now
on
clothes
were
brought
to
him
and
shoes
and
every
day
a
servant
prepared
a
bath
for
him
twice
a
day
a
plentiful
meal
was
served
but
siddhartha
only
ate
once
a
day
and
ate
neither
meat
nor
did
he
drink
wine
kamaswami
told
him
about
his
trade
showed
him
the
merchandise
and
showed
him
calculations
siddhartha
got
to
know
many
new
things
he
heard
a
lot
and
spoke
little
and
thinking
of
kamala
words
he
was
never
subservient
to
the
merchant
forced
him
to
treat
him
as
an
equal
yes
even
more
than
an
equal
kamaswami
conducted
his
business
with
care
and
often
with
passion
but
siddhartha
looked
upon
all
of
this
as
if
it
was
a
game
the
rules
of
which
he
tried
hard
to
learn
precisely
but
the
contents
of
which
did
not
touch
his
heart
he
was
not
in
kamaswami
house
for
long
when
he
already
took
part
in
his
landlords
business
but
daily
at
the
hour
appointed
by
her
he
visited
beautiful
kamala
wearing
pretty
clothes
fine
shoes
and
soon
he
brought
her
gifts
as
well
much
he
learned
from
her
red
smart
mouth
much
he
learned
from
her
tender
supple
hand
him
who
was
regarding
love
still
a
boy
and
had
a
tendency
to
plunge
blindly
and
insatiably
into
lust
like
into
a
bottomless
pit
him
she
taught
thoroughly
starting
with
the
basics
about
that
school
of
thought
which
teaches
that
pleasure
can
not
be
taken
without
giving
pleasure
and
that
every
gesture
every
caress
every
touch
every
look
every
spot
of
the
body
however
small
it
was
had
its
secret
which
would
bring
happiness
to
those
who
know
about
it
and
unleash
it
she
taught
him
that
lovers
must
not
part
from
one
another
after
celebrating
love
without
one
admiring
the
other
without
being
just
as
defeated
as
they
have
been
victorious
so
that
with
none
of
them
should
start
feeling
fed
up
or
bored
and
get
that
evil
feeling
of
having
abused
or
having
been
abused
wonderful
hours
he
spent
with
the
beautiful
and
smart
artist
became
her
student
her
lover
her
friend
here
with
kamala
was
the
worth
and
purpose
of
his
present
life
nit
with
the
business
of
kamaswami
the
merchant
passed
to
duties
of
writing
important
letters
and
contracts
on
to
him
and
got
into
the
habit
of
discussing
all
important
affairs
with
him
he
soon
saw
that
siddhartha
knew
little
about
rice
and
wool
shipping
and
trade
but
that
he
acted
in
a
fortunate
manner
and
that
siddhartha
surpassed
him
the
merchant
in
calmness
and
equanimity
and
in
the
art
of
listening
and
deeply
understanding
previously
unknown
people
this
brahman
he
said
to
a
friend
is
no
proper
merchant
and
will
never
be
one
there
is
never
any
passion
in
his
soul
when
he
conducts
our
business
but
he
has
that
mysterious
quality
of
those
people
to
whom
success
comes
all
by
itself
whether
this
may
be
a
good
star
of
his
birth
magic
or
something
he
has
learned
among
samanas
he
always
seems
to
be
merely
playing
with
out
they
never
fully
become
a
part
of
him
they
never
rule
over
him
he
is
never
afraid
of
failure
he
is
never
upset
by
a
loss
the
friend
advised
the
merchant
give
him
from
the
business
he
conducts
for
you
a
third
of
the
profits
but
let
him
also
be
liable
for
the
same
amount
of
the
losses
when
there
is
a
loss
then
he
become
more
zealous
kamaswami
followed
the
advice
but
siddhartha
cared
little
about
this
when
he
made
a
profit
he
accepted
it
with
equanimity
when
he
made
losses
he
laughed
and
said
well
look
at
this
so
this
one
turned
out
badly
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
he
did
not
care
about
the
business
at
one
time
he
travelled
to
a
village
to
buy
a
large
harvest
of
rice
there
but
when
he
got
there
the
rice
had
already
been
sold
to
another
merchant
nevertheless
siddhartha
stayed
for
several
days
in
that
village
treated
the
farmers
for
a
drink
gave
to
their
children
joined
in
the
celebration
of
a
wedding
and
returned
extremely
satisfied
from
his
trip
kamaswami
held
against
him
that
he
had
not
turned
back
right
away
that
he
had
wasted
time
and
money
siddhartha
answered
stop
scolding
dear
friend
nothing
was
ever
achieved
by
scolding
if
a
loss
has
occurred
let
me
bear
that
loss
i
am
very
satisfied
with
this
trip
i
have
gotten
to
know
many
kinds
of
people
a
brahman
has
become
my
friend
children
have
sat
on
my
knees
farmers
have
shown
me
their
fields
nobody
knew
that
i
was
a
merchant
that
all
very
nice
exclaimed
kamaswami
indignantly
but
in
fact
you
are
a
merchant
after
all
one
ought
to
think
or
might
you
have
only
travelled
for
your
amusement
surely
siddhartha
laughed
surely
i
have
travelled
for
my
amusement
for
what
else
i
have
gotten
to
know
people
and
places
i
have
received
kindness
and
trust
i
have
found
friendship
look
my
dear
if
i
had
been
kamaswami
i
would
have
travelled
back
being
annoyed
and
in
a
hurry
as
soon
as
i
had
seen
that
my
purchase
had
been
rendered
impossible
and
time
and
money
would
indeed
have
been
lost
but
like
this
i
had
a
few
good
days
i
learned
had
joy
i
neither
harmed
myself
nor
others
by
annoyance
and
hastiness
and
if
i
ever
return
there
again
perhaps
to
buy
an
upcoming
harvest
or
for
whatever
purpose
it
might
be
friendly
people
will
receive
me
in
a
friendly
and
happy
manner
and
i
will
praise
myself
for
not
showing
any
hurry
and
displeasure
at
that
time
so
leave
it
as
it
is
my
friend
and
harm
yourself
by
scolding
if
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
see
this
siddhartha
is
harming
me
then
speak
a
word
and
siddhartha
will
go
on
his
own
path
but
until
then
let
be
satisfied
with
one
another
futile
were
also
the
merchant
attempts
to
convince
siddhartha
that
he
should
eat
his
bread
siddhartha
ate
his
own
bread
or
rather
they
both
ate
other
people
bread
all
people
bread
siddhartha
never
listened
to
kamaswami
worries
and
kamaswami
had
many
worries
whether
there
was
a
going
on
which
was
in
danger
of
failing
or
whether
a
shipment
of
merchandise
seemed
to
have
been
lost
or
a
debtor
seemed
to
be
unable
to
pay
kamaswami
could
never
convince
his
partner
that
it
would
be
useful
to
utter
a
few
words
of
worry
or
anger
to
have
wrinkles
on
the
forehead
to
sleep
badly
when
one
day
kamaswami
held
against
him
that
he
had
learned
everything
he
knew
from
him
he
replied
would
you
please
not
kid
me
with
such
jokes
what
i
learned
from
you
is
how
much
a
basket
of
fish
costs
and
how
much
interests
may
be
charged
on
loaned
money
these
are
your
areas
of
expertise
i
have
learned
to
think
from
you
my
dear
kamaswami
you
ought
to
be
the
one
seeking
to
learn
from
me
indeed
his
soul
was
not
with
the
trade
the
business
was
good
enough
to
provide
him
with
the
money
for
kamala
and
it
earned
him
much
more
than
he
needed
besides
from
this
siddhartha
interest
and
curiosity
was
only
concerned
with
the
people
whose
businesses
crafts
worries
pleasures
and
acts
of
foolishness
used
to
be
as
alien
and
distant
to
him
as
the
moon
however
easily
he
succeeded
in
talking
to
all
of
them
in
living
with
all
of
them
in
learning
from
all
of
them
he
was
still
aware
that
there
was
something
which
separated
him
from
them
and
this
separating
factor
was
him
being
a
samana
he
saw
mankind
going
through
life
in
a
childlike
or
animallike
manner
which
he
loved
and
also
despised
at
the
same
time
he
saw
them
toiling
saw
them
suffering
and
becoming
gray
for
the
sake
of
things
which
seemed
to
him
to
entirely
unworthy
of
this
price
for
money
for
little
pleasures
for
being
slightly
honoured
he
saw
them
scolding
and
insulting
each
other
he
saw
them
complaining
about
pain
at
which
a
samana
would
only
smile
and
suffering
because
of
deprivations
which
a
samana
would
not
feel
he
was
open
to
everything
these
people
brought
his
way
welcome
was
the
merchant
who
offered
him
linen
for
sale
welcome
was
the
debtor
who
sought
another
loan
welcome
was
the
beggar
who
told
him
for
one
hour
the
story
of
his
poverty
and
who
was
not
half
as
poor
as
any
given
samana
he
did
not
treat
the
rich
foreign
merchant
any
different
than
the
servant
who
shaved
him
and
the
whom
he
let
cheat
him
out
of
some
small
change
when
buying
bananas
when
kamaswami
came
to
him
to
complain
about
his
worries
or
to
reproach
him
concerning
his
business
he
listened
curiously
and
happily
was
puzzled
by
him
tried
to
understand
him
consented
that
he
was
a
little
bit
right
only
as
much
as
he
considered
indispensable
and
turned
away
from
him
towards
the
next
person
who
would
ask
for
him
and
there
were
many
who
came
to
him
many
to
do
business
with
him
many
to
cheat
him
many
to
draw
some
secret
out
of
him
many
to
appeal
to
his
sympathy
many
to
get
his
advice
he
gave
advice
he
pitied
he
made
gifts
he
let
them
cheat
him
a
bit
and
this
entire
game
and
the
passion
with
which
all
people
played
this
game
occupied
his
thoughts
just
as
much
as
the
gods
and
brahmans
used
to
occupy
them
at
times
he
felt
deep
in
his
chest
a
dying
quiet
voice
which
admonished
him
quietly
lamented
quietly
he
hardly
perceived
it
and
then
for
an
hour
he
became
aware
of
the
strange
life
he
was
leading
of
him
doing
lots
of
things
which
were
only
a
game
of
though
being
happy
and
feeling
joy
at
times
real
life
still
passing
him
by
and
not
touching
him
as
a
plays
with
his
balls
he
played
with
his
with
the
people
around
him
watched
them
found
amusement
in
them
with
his
heart
with
the
source
of
his
being
he
was
not
with
them
the
source
ran
somewhere
far
away
from
him
ran
and
ran
invisibly
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
life
any
more
and
at
several
times
he
suddenly
became
scared
on
account
of
such
thoughts
and
wished
that
he
would
also
be
gifted
with
the
ability
to
participate
in
all
of
this
occupations
of
the
daytime
with
passion
and
with
his
heart
really
to
live
really
to
act
really
to
enjoy
and
to
live
instead
of
just
standing
by
as
a
spectator
but
again
and
again
he
came
back
to
beautiful
kamala
learned
the
art
of
love
practised
the
cult
of
lust
in
which
more
than
in
anything
else
giving
and
taking
becomes
one
chatted
with
her
learned
from
her
gave
her
advice
received
advice
she
understood
him
better
than
govinda
used
to
understand
him
she
was
more
similar
to
him
once
he
said
to
her
you
are
like
me
you
are
different
from
most
people
you
are
kamala
nothing
else
and
inside
of
you
there
is
a
peace
and
refuge
to
which
you
can
go
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
be
at
home
at
yourself
as
i
can
also
do
few
people
have
this
and
yet
all
could
have
it
not
all
people
are
smart
said
kamala
no
said
siddhartha
that
not
the
reason
why
kamaswami
is
just
as
smart
as
i
and
still
has
no
refuge
in
himself
others
have
it
who
are
small
children
with
respect
to
their
mind
most
people
kamala
are
like
a
falling
leaf
which
is
blown
and
is
turning
around
through
the
air
and
wavers
and
tumbles
to
the
ground
but
others
a
few
are
like
stars
they
go
on
a
fixed
course
no
wind
reaches
them
in
themselves
they
have
their
law
and
their
course
among
all
the
learned
men
and
samanas
of
which
i
knew
many
there
was
one
of
this
kind
a
perfected
one
i
never
be
able
to
forget
him
it
is
that
gotama
the
exalted
one
who
is
spreading
that
teachings
thousands
of
followers
are
listening
to
his
teachings
every
day
follow
his
instructions
every
hour
but
they
are
all
falling
leaves
not
in
themselves
they
have
teachings
and
a
law
kamala
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
again
you
talking
about
him
she
said
again
you
having
a
samana
thoughts
siddhartha
said
nothing
and
they
played
the
game
of
love
one
of
the
thirty
or
forty
different
games
kamala
knew
her
body
was
flexible
like
that
of
a
jaguar
and
like
the
bow
of
a
hunter
he
who
had
learned
from
her
how
to
make
love
was
knowledgeable
of
many
forms
of
lust
many
secrets
for
a
long
time
she
played
with
siddhartha
enticed
him
rejected
him
forced
him
embraced
him
enjoyed
his
masterful
skills
until
he
was
defeated
and
rested
exhausted
by
her
side
the
courtesan
bent
over
him
took
a
long
look
at
his
face
at
his
eyes
which
had
grown
tired
you
are
the
best
lover
she
said
thoughtfully
i
ever
saw
stronger
than
others
more
supple
more
willing
you
learned
my
art
well
siddhartha
at
some
time
when
i
be
older
i
want
to
bear
your
child
and
yet
my
dear
you
remained
a
samana
and
yet
you
do
not
love
me
you
love
nobody
is
it
so
it
might
very
well
be
so
siddhartha
said
tiredly
i
am
like
you
you
also
do
not
love
how
else
could
you
practise
love
as
a
craft
perhaps
people
of
our
kind
ca
love
the
childlike
people
can
that
their
secret
sansara
for
a
long
time
siddhartha
had
lived
the
life
of
the
world
and
of
lust
though
without
being
a
part
of
it
his
senses
which
he
had
killed
off
in
hot
years
as
a
samana
had
awoken
again
he
had
tasted
riches
had
tasted
lust
had
tasted
power
nevertheless
he
had
still
remained
in
his
heart
for
a
long
time
a
samana
kamala
being
smart
had
realized
this
quite
right
it
was
still
the
art
of
thinking
of
waiting
of
fasting
which
guided
his
life
still
the
people
of
the
world
the
childlike
people
had
remained
alien
to
him
as
he
was
alien
to
them
years
passed
by
surrounded
by
the
good
life
siddhartha
hardly
felt
them
fading
away
he
had
become
rich
for
quite
a
while
he
possessed
a
house
of
his
own
and
his
own
servants
and
a
garden
before
the
city
by
the
river
the
people
liked
him
they
came
to
him
whenever
they
needed
money
or
advice
but
there
was
nobody
close
to
him
except
kamala
that
high
bright
state
of
being
awake
which
he
had
experienced
that
one
time
at
the
height
of
his
youth
in
those
days
after
sermon
after
the
separation
from
govinda
that
tense
expectation
that
proud
state
of
standing
alone
without
teachings
and
without
teachers
that
supple
willingness
to
listen
to
the
divine
voice
in
his
own
heart
had
slowly
become
a
memory
had
been
fleeting
distant
and
quiet
the
holy
source
murmured
which
used
to
be
near
which
used
to
murmur
within
himself
nevertheless
many
things
he
had
learned
from
the
samanas
he
had
learned
from
gotama
he
had
learned
from
his
father
the
brahman
had
remained
within
him
for
a
long
time
afterwards
moderate
living
joy
of
thinking
hours
of
meditation
secret
knowledge
of
the
self
of
his
eternal
entity
which
is
neither
body
nor
consciousness
many
a
part
of
this
he
still
had
but
one
part
after
another
had
been
submerged
and
had
gathered
dust
just
as
a
potter
wheel
once
it
has
been
set
in
motion
will
keep
on
turning
for
a
long
time
and
only
slowly
lose
its
vigour
and
come
to
a
stop
thus
siddhartha
soul
had
kept
on
turning
the
wheel
of
asceticism
the
wheel
of
thinking
the
wheel
of
differentiation
for
a
long
time
still
turning
but
it
turned
slowly
and
hesitantly
and
was
close
to
coming
to
a
standstill
slowly
like
humidity
entering
the
dying
stem
of
a
tree
filling
it
slowly
and
making
it
rot
the
world
and
sloth
had
entered
siddhartha
soul
slowly
it
filled
his
soul
made
it
heavy
made
it
tired
put
it
to
sleep
on
the
other
hand
his
senses
had
become
alive
there
was
much
they
had
learned
much
they
had
experienced
siddhartha
had
learned
to
trade
to
use
his
power
over
people
to
enjoy
himself
with
a
woman
he
had
learned
to
wear
beautiful
clothes
to
give
orders
to
servants
to
bathe
in
perfumed
waters
he
had
learned
to
eat
tenderly
and
carefully
prepared
food
even
fish
even
meat
and
poultry
spices
and
sweets
and
to
drink
wine
which
causes
sloth
and
forgetfulness
he
had
learned
to
play
with
dice
and
on
a
to
watch
dancing
girls
to
have
himself
carried
about
in
a
to
sleep
on
a
soft
bed
but
still
he
had
felt
different
from
and
superior
to
the
others
always
he
had
watched
them
with
some
mockery
some
mocking
disdain
with
the
same
disdain
which
a
samana
constantly
feels
for
the
people
of
the
world
when
kamaswami
was
ailing
when
he
was
annoyed
when
he
felt
insulted
when
he
was
vexed
by
his
worries
as
a
merchant
siddhartha
had
always
watched
it
with
mockery
just
slowly
and
imperceptibly
as
the
harvest
seasons
and
rainy
seasons
passed
by
his
mockery
had
become
more
tired
his
superiority
had
become
more
quiet
just
slowly
among
his
growing
riches
siddhartha
had
assumed
something
of
the
childlike
people
ways
for
himself
something
of
their
childlikeness
and
of
their
fearfulness
and
yet
he
envied
them
envied
them
just
the
more
the
more
similar
he
became
to
them
he
envied
them
for
the
one
thing
that
was
missing
from
him
and
that
they
had
the
importance
they
were
able
to
attach
to
their
lives
the
amount
of
passion
in
their
joys
and
fears
the
fearful
but
sweet
happiness
of
being
constantly
in
love
these
people
were
all
of
the
time
in
love
with
themselves
with
women
with
their
children
with
honours
or
money
with
plans
or
hopes
but
he
did
not
learn
this
from
them
this
out
of
all
things
this
joy
of
a
child
and
this
foolishness
of
a
child
he
learned
from
them
out
of
all
things
the
unpleasant
ones
which
he
himself
despised
it
happened
more
and
more
often
that
in
the
morning
after
having
had
company
the
night
before
he
stayed
in
bed
for
a
long
time
felt
unable
to
think
and
tired
it
happened
that
he
became
angry
and
impatient
when
kamaswami
bored
him
with
his
worries
it
happened
that
he
laughed
just
too
loud
when
he
lost
a
game
of
dice
his
face
was
still
smarter
and
more
spiritual
than
others
but
it
rarely
laughed
and
assumed
one
after
another
those
features
which
are
so
often
found
in
the
faces
of
rich
people
those
features
of
discontent
of
sickliness
of
of
sloth
of
a
lack
of
love
slowly
the
disease
of
the
soul
which
rich
people
have
grabbed
hold
of
him
like
a
veil
like
a
thin
mist
tiredness
came
over
siddhartha
slowly
getting
a
bit
denser
every
day
a
bit
murkier
every
month
a
bit
heavier
every
year
as
a
new
dress
becomes
old
in
time
loses
its
beautiful
colour
in
time
gets
stains
gets
wrinkles
gets
worn
off
at
the
seams
and
starts
to
show
threadbare
spots
here
and
there
thus
new
life
which
he
had
started
after
his
separation
from
govinda
had
grown
old
lost
colour
and
splendour
as
the
years
passed
by
was
gathering
wrinkles
and
stains
and
hidden
at
bottom
already
showing
its
ugliness
here
and
there
disappointment
and
disgust
were
waiting
siddhartha
did
not
notice
it
he
only
noticed
that
this
bright
and
reliable
voice
inside
of
him
which
had
awoken
in
him
at
that
time
and
had
ever
guided
him
in
his
best
times
had
become
silent
he
had
been
captured
by
the
world
by
lust
covetousness
sloth
and
finally
also
by
that
vice
which
he
had
used
to
despise
and
mock
the
most
as
the
most
foolish
one
of
all
vices
greed
property
possessions
and
riches
also
had
finally
captured
him
they
were
no
longer
a
game
and
trifles
to
him
had
become
a
shackle
and
a
burden
on
a
strange
and
devious
way
siddhartha
had
gotten
into
this
final
and
most
base
of
all
dependencies
by
means
of
the
game
of
dice
it
was
since
that
time
when
he
had
stopped
being
a
samana
in
his
heart
that
siddhartha
began
to
play
the
game
for
money
and
precious
things
which
he
at
other
times
only
joined
with
a
smile
and
casually
as
a
custom
of
the
childlike
people
with
an
increasing
rage
and
passion
he
was
a
feared
gambler
few
dared
to
take
him
on
so
high
and
audacious
were
his
stakes
he
played
the
game
due
to
a
pain
of
his
heart
losing
and
wasting
his
wretched
money
in
the
game
brought
him
an
angry
joy
in
no
other
way
he
could
demonstrate
his
disdain
for
wealth
the
false
god
more
clearly
and
more
mockingly
thus
he
gambled
with
high
stakes
and
mercilessly
hating
himself
mocking
himself
won
thousands
threw
away
thousands
lost
money
lost
jewelry
lost
a
house
in
the
country
won
again
lost
again
that
fear
that
terrible
and
petrifying
fear
which
he
felt
while
he
was
rolling
the
dice
while
he
was
worried
about
losing
high
stakes
that
fear
he
loved
and
sought
to
always
renew
it
always
increase
it
always
get
it
to
a
slightly
higher
level
for
in
this
feeling
alone
he
still
felt
something
like
happiness
something
like
an
intoxication
something
like
an
elevated
form
of
life
in
the
midst
of
his
saturated
lukewarm
dull
life
and
after
each
big
loss
his
mind
was
set
on
new
riches
pursued
the
trade
more
zealously
forced
his
debtors
more
strictly
to
pay
because
he
wanted
to
continue
gambling
he
wanted
to
continue
squandering
continue
demonstrating
his
disdain
of
wealth
siddhartha
lost
his
calmness
when
losses
occurred
lost
his
patience
when
he
was
not
payed
on
time
lost
his
kindness
towards
beggars
lost
his
disposition
for
giving
away
and
loaning
money
to
those
who
petitioned
him
he
who
gambled
away
tens
of
thousands
at
one
roll
of
the
dice
and
laughed
at
it
became
more
strict
and
more
petty
in
his
business
occasionally
dreaming
at
night
about
money
and
whenever
he
woke
up
from
this
ugly
spell
whenever
he
found
his
face
in
the
mirror
at
the
bedroom
wall
to
have
aged
and
become
more
ugly
whenever
embarrassment
and
disgust
came
over
him
he
continued
fleeing
fleeing
into
a
new
game
fleeing
into
a
numbing
of
his
mind
brought
on
by
sex
by
wine
and
from
there
he
fled
back
into
the
urge
to
pile
up
and
obtain
possessions
in
this
pointless
cycle
he
ran
growing
tired
growing
old
growing
then
the
time
came
when
a
dream
warned
him
he
had
spend
the
hours
of
the
evening
with
kamala
in
her
beautiful
they
had
been
sitting
under
the
trees
talking
and
kamala
had
said
thoughtful
words
words
behind
which
a
sadness
and
tiredness
lay
hidden
she
had
asked
him
to
tell
her
about
gotama
and
could
not
hear
enough
of
him
how
clear
his
eyes
how
still
and
beautiful
his
mouth
how
kind
his
smile
how
peaceful
his
walk
had
been
for
a
long
time
he
had
to
tell
her
about
the
exalted
buddha
and
kamala
had
sighed
and
had
said
one
day
perhaps
soon
i
also
follow
that
buddha
i
give
him
my
for
a
gift
and
take
my
refuge
in
his
teachings
but
after
this
she
had
aroused
him
and
had
tied
him
to
her
in
the
act
of
making
love
with
painful
fervour
biting
and
in
tears
as
if
once
more
she
wanted
to
squeeze
the
last
sweet
drop
out
of
this
vain
fleeting
pleasure
never
before
it
had
become
so
strangely
clear
to
siddhartha
how
closely
lust
was
akin
to
death
then
he
had
lain
by
her
side
and
kamala
face
had
been
close
to
him
and
under
her
eyes
and
next
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
he
had
as
clearly
as
never
before
read
a
fearful
inscription
an
inscription
of
small
lines
of
slight
grooves
an
inscription
reminiscent
of
autumn
and
old
age
just
as
siddhartha
himself
who
was
only
in
his
forties
had
already
noticed
here
and
there
gray
hairs
among
his
black
ones
tiredness
was
written
on
kamala
beautiful
face
tiredness
from
walking
a
long
path
which
has
no
happy
destination
tiredness
and
the
beginning
of
withering
and
concealed
still
unsaid
perhaps
not
even
conscious
anxiety
fear
of
old
age
fear
of
the
autumn
fear
of
having
to
die
with
a
sigh
he
had
bid
his
farewell
to
her
the
soul
full
of
reluctance
and
full
of
concealed
anxiety
then
siddhartha
had
spent
the
night
in
his
house
with
dancing
girls
and
wine
had
acted
as
if
he
was
superior
to
them
towards
the
of
his
caste
though
this
was
no
longer
true
had
drunk
much
wine
and
gone
to
bed
a
long
time
after
midnight
being
tired
and
yet
excited
close
to
weeping
and
despair
and
had
for
a
long
time
sought
to
sleep
in
vain
his
heart
full
of
misery
which
he
thought
he
could
not
bear
any
longer
full
of
a
disgust
which
he
felt
penetrating
his
entire
body
like
the
lukewarm
repulsive
taste
of
the
wine
the
just
too
sweet
dull
music
the
just
too
soft
smile
of
the
dancing
girls
the
just
too
sweet
scent
of
their
hair
and
breasts
but
more
than
by
anything
else
he
was
disgusted
by
himself
by
his
perfumed
hair
by
the
smell
of
wine
from
his
mouth
by
the
flabby
tiredness
and
listlessness
of
his
skin
like
when
someone
who
has
eaten
and
drunk
far
too
much
vomits
it
back
up
again
with
agonising
pain
and
is
nevertheless
glad
about
the
relief
thus
this
sleepless
man
wished
to
free
himself
of
these
pleasures
these
habits
and
all
of
this
pointless
life
and
himself
in
an
immense
burst
of
disgust
not
until
the
light
of
the
morning
and
the
beginning
of
the
first
activities
in
the
street
before
his
he
had
slightly
fallen
asleep
had
found
for
a
few
moments
a
half
unconsciousness
a
hint
of
sleep
in
those
moments
he
had
a
dream
kamala
owned
a
small
rare
singing
bird
in
a
golden
cage
of
this
bird
he
dreamt
he
dreamt
this
bird
had
become
mute
who
at
other
times
always
used
to
sing
in
the
morning
and
since
this
arose
his
attention
he
stepped
in
front
of
the
cage
and
looked
inside
there
the
small
bird
was
dead
and
lay
stiff
on
the
ground
he
took
it
out
weighed
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hand
and
then
threw
it
away
out
in
the
street
and
in
the
same
moment
he
felt
terribly
shocked
and
his
heart
hurt
as
if
he
had
thrown
away
from
himself
all
value
and
everything
good
by
throwing
out
this
dead
bird
starting
up
from
this
dream
he
felt
encompassed
by
a
deep
sadness
worthless
so
it
seemed
to
him
worthless
and
pointless
was
the
way
he
had
been
going
through
life
nothing
which
was
alive
nothing
which
was
in
some
way
delicious
or
worth
keeping
he
had
left
in
his
hands
alone
he
stood
there
and
empty
like
a
castaway
on
the
shore
with
a
gloomy
mind
siddhartha
went
to
the
he
owned
locked
the
gate
sat
down
under
a
felt
death
in
his
heart
and
horror
in
his
chest
sat
and
sensed
how
everything
died
in
him
withered
in
him
came
to
an
end
in
him
by
and
by
he
gathered
his
thoughts
and
in
his
mind
he
once
again
went
the
entire
path
of
his
life
starting
with
the
first
days
he
could
remember
when
was
there
ever
a
time
when
he
had
experienced
happiness
felt
a
true
bliss
oh
yes
several
times
he
had
experienced
such
a
thing
in
his
years
as
a
boy
he
has
had
a
taste
of
it
when
he
had
obtained
praise
from
the
brahmans
he
had
felt
it
in
his
heart
there
is
a
path
in
front
of
the
one
who
has
distinguished
himself
in
the
recitation
of
the
holy
verses
in
the
dispute
with
the
learned
ones
as
an
assistant
in
the
offerings
then
he
had
felt
it
in
his
heart
there
is
a
path
in
front
of
you
you
are
destined
for
the
gods
are
awaiting
you
and
again
as
a
young
man
when
the
ever
rising
upward
fleeing
goal
of
all
thinking
had
ripped
him
out
of
and
up
from
the
multitude
of
those
seeking
the
same
goal
when
he
wrestled
in
pain
for
the
purpose
of
brahman
when
every
obtained
knowledge
only
kindled
new
thirst
in
him
then
again
he
had
in
the
midst
of
the
thirst
in
the
midst
of
the
pain
felt
this
very
same
thing
go
on
go
on
you
are
called
upon
he
had
heard
this
voice
when
he
had
left
his
home
and
had
chosen
the
life
of
a
samana
and
again
when
he
had
gone
away
from
the
samanas
to
that
perfected
one
and
also
when
he
had
gone
away
from
him
to
the
uncertain
for
how
long
had
he
not
heard
this
voice
any
more
for
how
long
had
he
reached
no
height
any
more
how
even
and
dull
was
the
manner
in
which
his
path
had
passed
through
life
for
many
long
years
without
a
high
goal
without
thirst
without
elevation
content
with
small
lustful
pleasures
and
yet
never
satisfied
for
all
of
these
many
years
without
knowing
it
himself
he
had
tried
hard
and
longed
to
become
a
man
like
those
many
like
those
children
and
in
all
this
his
life
had
been
much
more
miserable
and
poorer
than
theirs
and
their
goals
were
not
his
nor
their
worries
after
all
that
entire
world
of
the
had
only
been
a
game
to
him
a
dance
he
would
watch
a
comedy
only
kamala
had
been
dear
had
been
valuable
to
him
but
was
she
still
thus
did
he
still
need
her
or
she
him
did
they
not
play
a
game
without
an
ending
was
it
necessary
to
live
for
this
no
it
was
not
necessary
the
name
of
this
game
was
sansara
a
game
for
children
a
game
which
was
perhaps
enjoyable
to
play
once
twice
ten
times
but
for
ever
and
ever
over
again
then
siddhartha
knew
that
the
game
was
over
that
he
could
not
play
it
any
more
shivers
ran
over
his
body
inside
of
him
so
he
felt
something
had
died
that
entire
day
he
sat
under
the
thinking
of
his
father
thinking
of
govinda
thinking
of
gotama
did
he
have
to
leave
them
to
become
a
kamaswami
he
still
sat
there
when
the
night
had
fallen
when
looking
up
he
caught
sight
of
the
stars
he
thought
here
sitting
under
my
in
my
he
smiled
a
little
was
it
really
necessary
was
it
right
was
it
not
as
foolish
game
that
he
owned
a
that
he
owned
a
garden
he
also
put
an
end
to
this
this
also
died
in
him
he
rose
bid
his
farewell
to
the
his
farewell
to
the
since
he
had
been
without
food
this
day
he
felt
strong
hunger
and
thought
of
his
house
in
the
city
of
his
chamber
and
bed
of
the
table
with
the
meals
on
it
he
smiled
tiredly
shook
himself
and
bid
his
farewell
to
these
things
in
the
same
hour
of
the
night
siddhartha
left
his
garden
left
the
city
and
never
came
back
for
a
long
time
kamaswami
had
people
look
for
him
thinking
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
robbers
kamala
had
no
one
look
for
him
when
she
was
told
that
siddhartha
had
disappeared
she
was
not
astonished
did
she
not
always
expect
it
was
he
not
a
samana
a
man
who
was
at
home
nowhere
a
pilgrim
and
most
of
all
she
had
felt
this
the
last
time
they
had
been
together
and
she
was
happy
in
spite
of
all
the
pain
of
the
loss
that
she
had
pulled
him
so
affectionately
to
her
heart
for
this
last
time
that
she
had
felt
one
more
time
to
be
so
completely
possessed
and
penetrated
by
him
when
she
received
the
first
news
of
siddhartha
disappearance
she
went
to
the
window
where
she
held
a
rare
singing
bird
captive
in
a
golden
cage
she
opened
the
door
of
the
cage
took
the
bird
out
and
let
it
fly
for
a
long
time
she
gazed
after
it
the
flying
bird
from
this
day
on
she
received
no
more
visitors
and
kept
her
house
locked
but
after
some
time
she
became
aware
that
she
was
pregnant
from
the
last
time
she
was
together
with
siddhartha
by
the
river
siddhartha
walked
through
the
forest
was
already
far
from
the
city
and
knew
nothing
but
that
one
thing
that
there
was
no
going
back
for
him
that
this
life
as
he
had
lived
it
for
many
years
until
now
was
over
and
done
away
with
and
that
he
had
tasted
all
of
it
sucked
everything
out
of
it
until
he
was
disgusted
with
it
dead
was
the
singing
bird
he
had
dreamt
of
dead
was
the
bird
in
his
heart
deeply
he
had
been
entangled
in
sansara
he
had
sucked
up
disgust
and
death
from
all
sides
into
his
body
like
a
sponge
sucks
up
water
until
it
is
full
and
full
he
was
full
of
the
feeling
of
been
sick
of
it
full
of
misery
full
of
death
there
was
nothing
left
in
this
world
which
could
have
attracted
him
given
him
joy
given
him
comfort
passionately
he
wished
to
know
nothing
about
himself
anymore
to
have
rest
to
be
dead
if
there
only
was
a
to
strike
him
dead
if
there
only
was
a
tiger
to
devour
him
if
there
only
was
a
wine
a
poison
which
would
numb
his
senses
bring
him
forgetfulness
and
sleep
and
no
awakening
from
that
was
there
still
any
kind
of
filth
he
had
not
soiled
himself
with
a
sin
or
foolish
act
he
had
not
committed
a
dreariness
of
the
soul
he
had
not
brought
upon
himself
was
it
still
at
all
possible
to
be
alive
was
it
possible
to
breathe
in
again
and
again
to
breathe
out
to
feel
hunger
to
eat
again
to
sleep
again
to
sleep
with
a
woman
again
was
this
cycle
not
exhausted
and
brought
to
a
conclusion
for
him
siddhartha
reached
the
large
river
in
the
forest
the
same
river
over
which
a
long
time
ago
when
he
had
still
been
a
young
man
and
came
from
the
town
of
gotama
a
ferryman
had
conducted
him
by
this
river
he
stopped
hesitantly
he
stood
at
the
bank
tiredness
and
hunger
had
weakened
him
and
whatever
for
should
he
walk
on
wherever
to
to
which
goal
no
there
were
no
more
goals
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
deep
painful
yearning
to
shake
off
this
whole
desolate
dream
to
spit
out
this
stale
wine
to
put
an
end
to
this
miserable
and
shameful
life
a
hang
bent
over
the
bank
of
the
river
a
siddhartha
leaned
against
its
trunk
with
his
shoulder
embraced
the
trunk
with
one
arm
and
looked
down
into
the
green
water
which
ran
and
ran
under
him
looked
down
and
found
himself
to
be
entirely
filled
with
the
wish
to
let
go
and
to
drown
in
these
waters
a
frightening
emptiness
was
reflected
back
at
him
by
the
water
answering
to
the
terrible
emptiness
in
his
soul
yes
he
had
reached
the
end
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
except
to
annihilate
himself
except
to
smash
the
failure
into
which
he
had
shaped
his
life
to
throw
it
away
before
the
feet
of
mockingly
laughing
gods
this
was
the
great
vomiting
he
had
longed
for
death
the
smashing
to
bits
of
the
form
he
hated
let
him
be
food
for
fishes
this
dog
siddhartha
this
lunatic
this
depraved
and
rotten
body
this
weakened
and
abused
soul
let
him
be
food
for
fishes
and
crocodiles
let
him
be
chopped
to
bits
by
the
daemons
with
a
distorted
face
he
stared
into
the
water
saw
the
reflection
of
his
face
and
spit
at
it
in
deep
tiredness
he
took
his
arm
away
from
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
turned
a
bit
in
order
to
let
himself
fall
straight
down
in
order
to
finally
drown
with
his
eyes
closed
he
slipped
towards
death
then
out
of
remote
areas
of
his
soul
out
of
past
times
of
his
now
weary
life
a
sound
stirred
up
it
was
a
word
a
syllable
which
he
without
thinking
with
a
slurred
voice
spoke
to
himself
the
old
word
which
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
prayers
of
the
brahmans
the
holy
om
which
roughly
means
that
what
is
perfect
or
the
completion
and
in
the
moment
when
the
sound
of
om
touched
siddhartha
ear
his
dormant
spirit
suddenly
woke
up
and
realized
the
foolishness
of
his
actions
siddhartha
was
deeply
shocked
so
this
was
how
things
were
with
him
so
doomed
was
he
so
much
he
had
lost
his
way
and
was
forsaken
by
all
knowledge
that
he
had
been
able
to
seek
death
that
this
wish
this
wish
of
a
child
had
been
able
to
grow
in
him
to
find
rest
by
annihilating
his
body
what
all
agony
of
these
recent
times
all
sobering
realizations
all
desperation
had
not
brought
about
this
was
brought
on
by
this
moment
when
the
om
entered
his
consciousness
he
became
aware
of
himself
in
his
misery
and
in
his
error
om
he
spoke
to
himself
om
and
again
he
knew
about
brahman
knew
about
the
indestructibility
of
life
knew
about
all
that
is
divine
which
he
had
forgotten
but
this
was
only
a
moment
flash
by
the
foot
of
the
siddhartha
collapsed
struck
down
by
tiredness
mumbling
om
placed
his
head
on
the
root
of
the
tree
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
deep
was
his
sleep
and
without
dreams
for
a
long
time
he
had
not
known
such
a
sleep
any
more
when
he
woke
up
after
many
hours
he
felt
as
if
ten
years
had
passed
he
heard
the
water
quietly
flowing
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
who
had
brought
him
here
opened
his
eyes
saw
with
astonishment
that
there
were
trees
and
the
sky
above
him
and
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
how
he
got
here
but
it
took
him
a
long
while
for
this
and
the
past
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
been
covered
by
a
veil
infinitely
distant
infinitely
far
away
infinitely
meaningless
he
only
knew
that
his
previous
life
in
the
first
moment
when
he
thought
about
it
this
past
life
seemed
to
him
like
a
very
old
previous
incarnation
like
an
early
of
his
present
self
that
his
previous
life
had
been
abandoned
by
him
that
full
of
disgust
and
wretchedness
he
had
even
intended
to
throw
his
life
away
but
that
by
a
river
under
a
he
has
come
to
his
senses
the
holy
word
om
on
his
lips
that
then
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
had
now
woken
up
and
was
looking
at
the
world
as
a
new
man
quietly
he
spoke
the
word
om
to
himself
speaking
which
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
entire
long
sleep
had
been
nothing
but
a
long
meditative
recitation
of
om
a
thinking
of
om
a
submergence
and
complete
entering
into
om
into
the
nameless
the
perfected
what
a
wonderful
sleep
had
this
been
never
before
by
sleep
he
had
been
thus
refreshed
thus
renewed
thus
rejuvenated
perhaps
he
had
really
died
had
drowned
and
was
reborn
in
a
new
body
but
no
he
knew
himself
he
knew
his
hand
and
his
feet
knew
the
place
where
he
lay
knew
this
self
in
his
chest
this
siddhartha
the
eccentric
the
weird
one
but
this
siddhartha
was
nevertheless
transformed
was
renewed
was
strangely
well
rested
strangely
awake
joyful
and
curious
siddhartha
straightened
up
then
he
saw
a
person
sitting
opposite
to
him
an
unknown
man
a
monk
in
a
yellow
robe
with
a
shaven
head
sitting
in
the
position
of
pondering
he
observed
the
man
who
had
neither
hair
on
his
head
nor
a
beard
and
he
had
not
observed
him
for
long
when
he
recognised
this
monk
as
govinda
the
friend
of
his
youth
govinda
who
had
taken
his
refuge
with
the
exalted
buddha
govinda
had
aged
he
too
but
still
his
face
bore
the
same
features
expressed
zeal
faithfulness
searching
timidness
but
when
govinda
now
sensing
his
gaze
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
siddhartha
saw
that
govinda
did
not
recognise
him
govinda
was
happy
to
find
him
awake
apparently
he
had
been
sitting
here
for
a
long
time
and
been
waiting
for
him
to
wake
up
though
he
did
not
know
him
i
have
been
sleeping
said
siddhartha
however
did
you
get
here
you
have
been
sleeping
answered
govinda
it
is
not
good
to
be
sleeping
in
such
places
where
snakes
often
are
and
the
animals
of
the
forest
have
their
paths
i
oh
sir
am
a
follower
of
the
exalted
gotama
the
buddha
the
sakyamuni
and
have
been
on
a
pilgrimage
together
with
several
of
us
on
this
path
when
i
saw
you
lying
and
sleeping
in
a
place
where
it
is
dangerous
to
sleep
therefore
i
sought
to
wake
you
up
oh
sir
and
since
i
saw
that
your
sleep
was
very
deep
i
stayed
behind
from
my
group
and
sat
with
you
and
then
so
it
seems
i
have
fallen
asleep
myself
i
who
wanted
to
guard
your
sleep
badly
i
have
served
you
tiredness
has
overwhelmed
me
but
now
that
awake
let
me
go
to
catch
up
with
my
brothers
i
thank
you
samana
for
watching
out
over
my
sleep
spoke
siddhartha
you
friendly
you
followers
of
the
exalted
one
now
you
may
go
then
i
going
sir
may
you
sir
always
be
in
good
health
i
thank
you
samana
govinda
made
the
gesture
of
a
salutation
and
said
farewell
farewell
govinda
said
siddhartha
the
monk
stopped
permit
me
to
ask
sir
from
where
do
you
know
my
name
now
siddhartha
smiled
i
know
you
oh
govinda
from
your
father
hut
and
from
the
school
of
the
brahmans
and
from
the
offerings
and
from
our
walk
to
the
samanas
and
from
that
hour
when
you
took
your
refuge
with
the
exalted
one
in
the
grove
jetavana
you
siddhartha
govinda
exclaimed
loudly
now
i
recognising
you
and
do
comprehend
any
more
how
i
could
recognise
you
right
away
be
welcome
siddhartha
my
joy
is
great
to
see
you
again
it
also
gives
me
joy
to
see
you
again
you
been
the
guard
of
my
sleep
again
i
thank
you
for
this
though
i
would
have
required
any
guard
where
are
you
going
to
oh
friend
i
going
nowhere
we
monks
are
always
travelling
whenever
it
is
not
the
rainy
season
we
always
move
from
one
place
to
another
live
according
to
the
rules
if
the
teachings
passed
on
to
us
accept
alms
move
on
it
is
always
like
this
but
you
siddhartha
where
are
you
going
to
quoth
siddhartha
with
me
too
friend
it
is
as
it
is
with
you
going
nowhere
i
just
travelling
i
on
a
pilgrimage
govinda
spoke
you
saying
you
on
a
pilgrimage
and
i
believe
in
you
but
forgive
me
oh
siddhartha
you
do
not
look
like
a
pilgrim
you
wearing
a
rich
man
garments
you
wearing
the
shoes
of
a
distinguished
gentleman
and
your
hair
with
the
fragrance
of
perfume
is
not
a
pilgrim
hair
not
the
hair
of
a
samana
right
so
my
dear
you
have
observed
well
your
keen
eyes
see
everything
but
i
have
said
to
you
that
i
was
a
samana
i
said
i
on
a
pilgrimage
and
so
it
is
i
on
a
pilgrimage
you
on
a
pilgrimage
said
govinda
but
few
would
go
on
a
pilgrimage
in
such
clothes
few
in
such
shoes
few
with
such
hair
never
i
have
met
such
a
pilgrim
being
a
pilgrim
myself
for
many
years
i
believe
you
my
dear
govinda
but
now
today
you
met
a
pilgrim
just
like
this
wearing
such
shoes
such
a
garment
remember
my
dear
not
eternal
is
the
world
of
appearances
not
eternal
anything
but
eternal
are
our
garments
and
the
style
of
our
hair
and
our
hair
and
bodies
themselves
i
wearing
a
rich
man
clothes
you
seen
this
quite
right
i
wearing
them
because
i
have
been
a
rich
man
and
wearing
my
hair
like
the
worldly
and
lustful
people
for
i
have
been
one
of
them
and
now
siddhartha
what
are
you
now
i
do
know
it
i
do
know
it
just
like
you
i
travelling
i
was
a
rich
man
and
am
no
rich
man
any
more
and
what
i
be
tomorrow
i
do
know
you
lost
your
riches
i
lost
them
or
they
me
they
somehow
happened
to
slip
away
from
me
the
wheel
of
physical
manifestations
is
turning
quickly
govinda
where
is
siddhartha
the
brahman
where
is
siddhartha
the
samana
where
is
siddhartha
the
rich
man
things
change
quickly
govinda
you
know
it
govinda
looked
at
the
friend
of
his
youth
for
a
long
time
with
doubt
in
his
eyes
after
that
he
gave
him
the
salutation
which
one
would
use
on
a
gentleman
and
went
on
his
way
with
a
smiling
face
siddhartha
watched
him
leave
he
loved
him
still
this
faithful
man
this
fearful
man
and
how
could
he
not
have
loved
everybody
and
everything
in
this
moment
in
the
glorious
hour
after
his
wonderful
sleep
filled
with
om
the
enchantment
which
had
happened
inside
of
him
in
his
sleep
and
by
means
of
the
om
was
this
very
thing
that
he
loved
everything
that
he
was
full
of
joyful
love
for
everything
he
saw
and
it
was
this
very
thing
so
it
seemed
to
him
now
which
had
been
his
sickness
before
that
he
was
not
able
to
love
anybody
or
anything
with
a
smiling
face
siddhartha
watched
the
leaving
monk
the
sleep
had
strengthened
him
much
but
hunger
gave
him
much
pain
for
by
now
he
had
not
eaten
for
two
days
and
the
times
were
long
past
when
he
had
been
tough
against
hunger
with
sadness
and
yet
also
with
a
smile
he
thought
of
that
time
in
those
days
so
he
remembered
he
had
boasted
of
three
things
to
kamala
had
been
able
to
do
three
noble
and
undefeatable
feats
fasting
waiting
thinking
these
had
been
his
possession
his
power
and
strength
his
solid
staff
in
the
busy
laborious
years
of
his
youth
he
had
learned
these
three
feats
nothing
else
and
now
they
had
abandoned
him
none
of
them
was
his
any
more
neither
fasting
nor
waiting
nor
thinking
for
the
most
wretched
things
he
had
given
them
up
for
what
fades
most
quickly
for
sensual
lust
for
the
good
life
for
riches
his
life
had
indeed
been
strange
and
now
so
it
seemed
now
he
had
really
become
a
childlike
person
siddhartha
thought
about
his
situation
thinking
was
hard
on
him
he
did
not
really
feel
like
it
but
he
forced
himself
now
he
thought
since
all
these
most
easily
perishing
things
have
slipped
from
me
again
now
i
standing
here
under
the
sun
again
just
as
i
have
been
standing
here
a
little
child
nothing
is
mine
i
have
no
abilities
there
is
nothing
i
could
bring
about
i
have
learned
nothing
how
wondrous
is
this
now
that
i
no
longer
young
that
my
hair
is
already
half
gray
that
my
strength
is
fading
now
i
starting
again
at
the
beginning
and
as
a
child
again
he
had
to
smile
yes
his
fate
had
been
strange
things
were
going
downhill
with
him
and
now
he
was
again
facing
the
world
void
and
naked
and
stupid
but
he
could
not
feed
sad
about
this
no
he
even
felt
a
great
urge
to
laugh
to
laugh
about
himself
to
laugh
about
this
strange
foolish
world
things
are
going
downhill
with
you
he
said
to
himself
and
laughed
about
it
and
as
he
was
saying
it
he
happened
to
glance
at
the
river
and
he
also
saw
the
river
going
downhill
always
moving
on
downhill
and
singing
and
being
happy
through
it
all
he
liked
this
well
kindly
he
smiled
at
the
river
was
this
not
the
river
in
which
he
had
intended
to
drown
himself
in
past
times
a
hundred
years
ago
or
had
he
dreamed
this
wondrous
indeed
was
my
life
so
he
thought
wondrous
detours
it
has
taken
as
i
boy
i
had
only
to
do
with
gods
and
offerings
as
a
youth
i
had
only
to
do
with
asceticism
with
thinking
and
meditation
was
searching
for
brahman
worshipped
the
eternal
in
the
atman
but
as
a
young
man
i
followed
the
penitents
lived
in
the
forest
suffered
of
heat
and
frost
learned
to
hunger
taught
my
body
to
become
dead
wonderfully
soon
afterwards
insight
came
towards
me
in
the
form
of
the
great
buddha
teachings
i
felt
the
knowledge
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
circling
in
me
like
my
own
blood
but
i
also
had
to
leave
buddha
and
the
great
knowledge
i
went
and
learned
the
art
of
love
with
kamala
learned
trading
with
kamaswami
piled
up
money
wasted
money
learned
to
love
my
stomach
learned
to
please
my
senses
i
had
to
spend
many
years
losing
my
spirit
to
unlearn
thinking
again
to
forget
the
oneness
is
it
just
as
if
i
had
turned
slowly
and
on
a
long
detour
from
a
man
into
a
child
from
a
thinker
into
a
childlike
person
and
yet
this
path
has
been
very
good
and
yet
the
bird
in
my
chest
has
not
died
but
what
a
path
has
this
been
i
had
to
pass
through
so
much
stupidity
through
so
much
vices
through
so
many
errors
through
so
much
disgust
and
disappointments
and
woe
just
to
become
a
child
again
and
to
be
able
to
start
over
but
it
was
right
so
my
heart
says
yes
to
it
my
eyes
smile
to
it
i
had
to
experience
despair
i
had
to
sink
down
to
the
most
foolish
one
of
all
thoughts
to
the
thought
of
suicide
in
order
to
be
able
to
experience
divine
grace
to
hear
om
again
to
be
able
to
sleep
properly
and
awake
properly
again
i
had
to
become
a
fool
to
find
atman
in
me
again
i
had
to
sin
to
be
able
to
live
again
where
else
might
my
path
lead
me
to
it
is
foolish
this
path
it
moves
in
loops
perhaps
it
is
going
around
in
a
circle
let
it
go
as
it
likes
i
want
to
take
it
wonderfully
he
felt
joy
rolling
like
waves
in
his
chest
wherever
from
he
asked
his
heart
where
from
did
you
get
this
happiness
might
it
come
from
that
long
good
sleep
which
has
done
me
so
good
or
from
the
word
om
which
i
said
or
from
the
fact
that
i
have
escaped
that
i
have
completely
fled
that
i
am
finally
free
again
and
am
standing
like
a
child
under
the
sky
oh
how
good
is
it
to
have
fled
to
have
become
free
how
clean
and
beautiful
is
the
air
here
how
good
to
breathe
there
where
i
ran
away
from
there
everything
smelled
of
ointments
of
spices
of
wine
of
excess
of
sloth
how
did
i
hate
this
world
of
the
rich
of
those
who
revel
in
fine
food
of
the
gamblers
how
did
i
hate
myself
for
staying
in
this
terrible
world
for
so
long
how
did
i
hate
myself
have
deprive
poisoned
tortured
myself
have
made
myself
old
and
evil
no
never
again
i
will
as
i
used
to
like
doing
so
much
delude
myself
into
thinking
that
siddhartha
was
wise
but
this
one
thing
i
have
done
well
this
i
like
this
i
must
praise
that
there
is
now
an
end
to
that
hatred
against
myself
to
that
foolish
and
dreary
life
i
praise
you
siddhartha
after
so
many
years
of
foolishness
you
have
once
again
had
an
idea
have
done
something
have
heard
the
bird
in
your
chest
singing
and
have
followed
it
thus
he
praised
himself
found
joy
in
himself
listened
curiously
to
his
stomach
which
was
rumbling
with
hunger
he
had
now
so
he
felt
in
these
recent
times
and
days
completely
tasted
and
spit
out
devoured
up
to
the
point
of
desperation
and
death
a
piece
of
suffering
a
piece
of
misery
like
this
it
was
good
for
much
longer
he
could
have
stayed
with
kamaswami
made
money
wasted
money
filled
his
stomach
and
let
his
soul
die
of
thirst
for
much
longer
he
could
have
lived
in
this
soft
well
upholstered
hell
if
this
had
not
happened
the
moment
of
complete
hopelessness
and
despair
that
most
extreme
moment
when
he
hung
over
the
rushing
waters
and
was
ready
to
destroy
himself
that
he
had
felt
this
despair
this
deep
disgust
and
that
he
had
not
succumbed
to
it
that
the
bird
the
joyful
source
and
voice
in
him
was
still
alive
after
all
this
was
why
he
felt
joy
this
was
why
he
laughed
this
was
why
his
face
was
smiling
brightly
under
his
hair
which
had
turned
gray
it
is
good
he
thought
to
get
a
taste
of
everything
for
oneself
which
one
needs
to
know
that
lust
for
the
world
and
riches
do
not
belong
to
the
good
things
i
have
already
learned
as
a
child
i
have
known
it
for
a
long
time
but
i
have
experienced
only
now
and
now
i
know
it
do
just
know
it
in
my
memory
but
in
my
eyes
in
my
heart
in
my
stomach
good
for
me
to
know
this
for
a
long
time
he
pondered
his
transformation
listened
to
the
bird
as
it
sang
for
joy
had
not
this
bird
died
in
him
had
he
not
felt
its
death
no
something
else
from
within
him
had
died
something
which
already
for
a
long
time
had
yearned
to
die
was
it
not
this
what
he
used
to
intend
to
kill
in
his
ardent
years
as
a
penitent
was
this
not
his
self
his
small
frightened
and
proud
self
he
had
wrestled
with
for
so
many
years
which
had
defeated
him
again
and
again
which
was
back
again
after
every
killing
prohibited
joy
felt
fear
was
it
not
this
which
today
had
finally
come
to
its
death
here
in
the
forest
by
this
lovely
river
was
it
not
due
to
this
death
that
he
was
now
like
a
child
so
full
of
trust
so
without
fear
so
full
of
joy
now
siddhartha
also
got
some
idea
of
why
he
had
fought
this
self
in
vain
as
a
brahman
as
a
penitent
too
much
knowledge
had
held
him
back
too
many
holy
verses
too
many
sacrificial
rules
to
much
so
much
doing
and
striving
for
that
goal
full
of
arrogance
he
had
been
always
the
smartest
always
working
the
most
always
one
step
ahead
of
all
others
always
the
knowing
and
spiritual
one
always
the
priest
or
wise
one
into
being
a
priest
into
this
arrogance
into
this
spirituality
his
self
had
retreated
there
it
sat
firmly
and
grew
while
he
thought
he
would
kill
it
by
fasting
and
penance
now
he
saw
it
and
saw
that
the
secret
voice
had
been
right
that
no
teacher
would
ever
have
been
able
to
bring
about
his
salvation
therefore
he
had
to
go
out
into
the
world
lose
himself
to
lust
and
power
to
woman
and
money
had
to
become
a
merchant
a
a
drinker
and
a
greedy
person
until
the
priest
and
samana
in
him
was
dead
therefore
he
had
to
continue
bearing
these
ugly
years
bearing
the
disgust
the
teachings
the
pointlessness
of
a
dreary
and
wasted
life
up
to
the
end
up
to
bitter
despair
until
siddhartha
the
lustful
siddhartha
the
greedy
could
also
die
he
had
died
a
new
siddhartha
had
woken
up
from
the
sleep
he
would
also
grow
old
he
would
also
eventually
have
to
die
mortal
was
siddhartha
mortal
was
every
physical
form
but
today
he
was
young
was
a
child
the
new
siddhartha
and
was
full
of
joy
he
thought
these
thoughts
listened
with
a
smile
to
his
stomach
listened
gratefully
to
a
buzzing
bee
cheerfully
he
looked
into
the
rushing
river
never
before
he
had
liked
a
water
so
well
as
this
one
never
before
he
had
perceived
the
voice
and
the
parable
of
the
moving
water
thus
strongly
and
beautifully
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
river
had
something
special
to
tell
him
something
he
did
not
know
yet
which
was
still
awaiting
him
in
this
river
siddhartha
had
intended
to
drown
himself
in
it
the
old
tired
desperate
siddhartha
had
drowned
today
but
the
new
siddhartha
felt
a
deep
love
for
this
rushing
water
and
decided
for
himself
not
to
leave
it
very
soon
the
ferryman
by
this
river
i
want
to
stay
thought
siddhartha
it
is
the
same
which
i
have
crossed
a
long
time
ago
on
my
way
to
the
childlike
people
a
friendly
ferryman
had
guided
me
then
he
is
the
one
i
want
to
go
to
starting
out
from
his
hut
my
path
had
led
me
at
that
time
into
a
new
life
which
had
now
grown
old
and
is
dead
my
present
path
my
present
new
life
shall
also
take
its
start
there
tenderly
he
looked
into
the
rushing
water
into
the
transparent
green
into
the
crystal
lines
of
its
drawing
so
rich
in
secrets
bright
pearls
he
saw
rising
from
the
deep
quiet
bubbles
of
air
floating
on
the
reflecting
surface
the
blue
of
the
sky
being
depicted
in
it
with
a
thousand
eyes
the
river
looked
at
him
with
green
ones
with
white
ones
with
crystal
ones
with
ones
how
did
he
love
this
water
how
did
it
delight
him
how
grateful
was
he
to
it
in
his
heart
he
heard
the
voice
talking
which
was
newly
awaking
and
it
told
him
love
this
water
stay
near
it
learn
from
it
oh
yes
he
wanted
to
learn
from
it
he
wanted
to
listen
to
it
he
who
would
understand
this
water
and
its
secrets
so
it
seemed
to
him
would
also
understand
many
other
things
many
secrets
all
secrets
but
out
of
all
secrets
of
the
river
he
today
only
saw
one
this
one
touched
his
soul
he
saw
this
water
ran
and
ran
incessantly
it
ran
and
was
nevertheless
always
there
was
always
at
all
times
the
same
and
yet
new
in
every
moment
great
be
he
who
would
grasp
this
understand
this
he
understood
and
grasped
it
not
only
felt
some
idea
of
it
stirring
a
distant
memory
divine
voices
siddhartha
rose
the
workings
of
hunger
in
his
body
became
unbearable
in
a
daze
he
walked
on
up
the
path
by
the
bank
upriver
listened
to
the
current
listened
to
the
rumbling
hunger
in
his
body
when
he
reached
the
ferry
the
boat
was
just
ready
and
the
same
ferryman
who
had
once
transported
the
young
samana
across
the
river
stood
in
the
boat
siddhartha
recognised
him
he
had
also
aged
very
much
would
you
like
to
ferry
me
over
he
asked
the
ferryman
being
astonished
to
see
such
an
elegant
man
walking
along
and
on
foot
took
him
into
his
boat
and
pushed
it
off
the
bank
it
a
beautiful
life
you
have
chosen
for
yourself
the
passenger
spoke
it
must
be
beautiful
to
live
by
this
water
every
day
and
to
cruise
on
it
with
a
smile
the
man
at
the
oar
moved
from
side
to
side
it
is
beautiful
sir
it
is
as
you
say
but
is
every
life
is
every
work
beautiful
this
may
be
true
but
i
envy
you
for
yours
ah
you
would
soon
stop
enjoying
it
this
is
nothing
for
people
wearing
fine
clothes
siddhartha
laughed
once
before
i
have
been
looked
upon
today
because
of
my
clothes
i
have
been
looked
upon
with
distrust
would
you
ferryman
like
to
accept
these
clothes
which
are
a
nuisance
to
me
from
me
for
you
must
know
i
have
no
money
to
pay
your
fare
you
joking
sir
the
ferryman
laughed
i
not
joking
friend
behold
once
before
you
have
ferried
me
across
this
water
in
your
boat
for
the
immaterial
reward
of
a
good
deed
thus
do
it
today
as
well
and
accept
my
clothes
for
it
and
do
you
sir
intent
to
continue
travelling
without
clothes
ah
most
of
all
i
would
want
to
continue
travelling
at
all
most
of
all
i
would
like
you
ferryman
to
give
me
an
old
loincloth
and
kept
me
with
you
as
your
assistant
or
rather
as
your
trainee
for
i
have
to
learn
first
how
to
handle
the
boat
for
a
long
time
the
ferryman
looked
at
the
stranger
searching
now
i
recognise
you
he
finally
said
at
one
time
you
slept
in
my
hut
this
was
a
long
time
ago
possibly
more
than
twenty
years
ago
and
you
been
ferried
across
the
river
by
me
and
we
parted
like
good
friends
have
you
been
a
samana
i
ca
think
of
your
name
any
more
my
name
is
siddhartha
and
i
was
a
samana
when
you
last
seen
me
so
be
welcome
siddhartha
my
name
is
vasudeva
you
will
so
i
hope
be
my
guest
today
as
well
and
sleep
in
my
hut
and
tell
me
where
coming
from
and
why
these
beautiful
clothes
are
such
a
nuisance
to
you
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
and
vasudeva
pushed
the
oar
with
more
strength
in
order
to
overcome
the
current
he
worked
calmly
his
eyes
fixed
in
on
the
front
of
the
boat
with
brawny
arms
siddhartha
sat
and
watched
him
and
remembered
how
once
before
on
that
last
day
of
his
time
as
a
samana
love
for
this
man
had
stirred
in
his
heart
gratefully
he
accepted
vasudeva
invitation
when
they
had
reached
the
bank
he
helped
him
to
tie
the
boat
to
the
stakes
after
this
the
ferryman
asked
him
to
enter
the
hut
offered
him
bread
and
water
and
siddhartha
ate
with
eager
pleasure
and
also
ate
with
eager
pleasure
of
the
mango
fruits
vasudeva
offered
him
afterwards
it
was
almost
the
time
of
the
sunset
they
sat
on
a
log
by
the
bank
and
siddhartha
told
the
ferryman
about
where
he
originally
came
from
and
about
his
life
as
he
had
seen
it
before
his
eyes
today
in
that
hour
of
despair
until
late
at
night
lasted
his
tale
vasudeva
listened
with
great
attention
listening
carefully
he
let
everything
enter
his
mind
birthplace
and
childhood
all
that
learning
all
that
searching
all
joy
all
distress
this
was
among
the
ferryman
virtues
one
of
the
greatest
like
only
a
few
he
knew
how
to
listen
without
him
having
spoken
a
word
the
speaker
sensed
how
vasudeva
let
his
words
enter
his
mind
quiet
open
waiting
how
he
did
not
lose
a
single
one
awaited
not
a
single
one
with
impatience
did
not
add
his
praise
or
rebuke
was
just
listening
siddhartha
felt
what
a
happy
fortune
it
is
to
confess
to
such
a
listener
to
bury
in
his
heart
his
own
life
his
own
search
his
own
suffering
but
in
the
end
of
siddhartha
tale
when
he
spoke
of
the
tree
by
the
river
and
of
his
deep
fall
of
the
holy
om
and
how
he
had
felt
such
a
love
for
the
river
after
his
slumber
the
ferryman
listened
with
twice
the
attention
entirely
and
completely
absorbed
by
it
with
his
eyes
closed
but
when
siddhartha
fell
silent
and
a
long
silence
had
occurred
then
vasudeva
said
it
is
as
i
thought
the
river
has
spoken
to
you
it
is
your
friend
as
well
it
speaks
to
you
as
well
that
is
good
that
is
very
good
stay
with
me
siddhartha
my
friend
i
used
to
have
a
wife
her
bed
was
next
to
mine
but
she
has
died
a
long
time
ago
for
a
long
time
i
have
lived
alone
now
you
shall
live
with
me
there
is
space
and
food
for
both
i
thank
you
said
siddhartha
i
thank
you
and
accept
and
i
also
thank
you
for
this
vasudeva
for
listening
to
me
so
well
these
people
are
rare
who
know
how
to
listen
and
i
did
not
meet
a
single
one
who
knew
it
as
well
as
you
did
i
will
also
learn
in
this
respect
from
you
you
will
learn
it
spoke
vasudeva
but
not
from
me
the
river
has
taught
me
to
listen
from
it
you
will
learn
it
as
well
it
knows
everything
the
river
everything
can
be
learned
from
it
see
already
learned
this
from
the
water
too
that
it
is
good
to
strive
downwards
to
sink
to
seek
depth
the
rich
and
elegant
siddhartha
is
becoming
an
oarsman
servant
the
learned
brahman
siddhartha
becomes
a
ferryman
this
has
also
been
told
to
you
by
the
river
you
learn
that
other
thing
from
it
as
well
quoth
siddhartha
after
a
long
pause
what
other
thing
vasudeva
vasudeva
rose
it
is
late
he
said
let
go
to
sleep
i
tell
you
that
other
thing
oh
friend
you
learn
it
or
perhaps
you
know
it
already
see
i
no
learned
man
i
have
no
special
skill
in
speaking
i
also
have
no
special
skill
in
thinking
all
i
able
to
do
is
to
listen
and
to
be
godly
i
have
learned
nothing
else
if
i
was
able
to
say
and
teach
it
i
might
be
a
wise
man
but
like
this
i
am
only
a
ferryman
and
it
is
my
task
to
ferry
people
across
the
river
i
have
transported
many
thousands
and
to
all
of
them
my
river
has
been
nothing
but
an
obstacle
on
their
travels
they
travelled
to
seek
money
and
business
and
for
weddings
and
on
pilgrimages
and
the
river
was
obstructing
their
path
and
the
ferryman
job
was
to
get
them
quickly
across
that
obstacle
but
for
some
among
thousands
a
few
four
or
five
the
river
has
stopped
being
an
obstacle
they
have
heard
its
voice
they
have
listened
to
it
and
the
river
has
become
sacred
to
them
as
it
has
become
sacred
to
me
let
rest
now
siddhartha
siddhartha
stayed
with
the
ferryman
and
learned
to
operate
the
boat
and
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
the
ferry
he
worked
with
vasudeva
in
the
gathered
wood
plucked
the
fruit
off
the
he
learned
to
build
an
oar
and
learned
to
mend
the
boat
and
to
weave
baskets
and
was
joyful
because
of
everything
he
learned
and
the
days
and
months
passed
quickly
but
more
than
vasudeva
could
teach
him
he
was
taught
by
the
river
incessantly
he
learned
from
it
most
of
all
he
learned
from
it
to
listen
to
pay
close
attention
with
a
quiet
heart
with
a
waiting
opened
soul
without
passion
without
a
wish
without
judgement
without
an
opinion
in
a
friendly
manner
he
lived
side
by
side
with
vasudeva
and
occasionally
they
exchanged
some
words
few
and
at
length
thought
about
words
vasudeva
was
no
friend
of
words
rarely
siddhartha
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
speak
did
you
so
he
asked
him
at
one
time
did
you
too
learn
that
secret
from
the
river
that
there
is
no
time
vasudeva
face
was
filled
with
a
bright
smile
yes
siddhartha
he
spoke
it
is
this
what
you
mean
is
it
that
the
river
is
everywhere
at
once
at
the
source
and
at
the
mouth
at
the
waterfall
at
the
ferry
at
the
rapids
in
the
sea
in
the
mountains
everywhere
at
once
and
that
there
is
only
the
present
time
for
it
not
the
shadow
of
the
past
not
the
shadow
of
the
future
this
it
is
said
siddhartha
and
when
i
had
learned
it
i
looked
at
my
life
and
it
was
also
a
river
and
the
boy
siddhartha
was
only
separated
from
the
man
siddhartha
and
from
the
old
man
siddhartha
by
a
shadow
not
by
something
real
also
siddhartha
previous
births
were
no
past
and
his
death
and
his
return
to
brahma
was
no
future
nothing
was
nothing
will
be
everything
is
everything
has
existence
and
is
present
siddhartha
spoke
with
ecstasy
deeply
this
enlightenment
had
delighted
him
oh
was
not
all
suffering
time
were
not
all
forms
of
tormenting
oneself
and
being
afraid
time
was
not
everything
hard
everything
hostile
in
the
world
gone
and
overcome
as
soon
as
one
had
overcome
time
as
soon
as
time
would
have
been
put
out
of
existence
by
one
thoughts
in
ecstatic
delight
he
had
spoken
but
vasudeva
smiled
at
him
brightly
and
nodded
in
confirmation
silently
he
nodded
brushed
his
hand
over
siddhartha
shoulder
turned
back
to
his
work
and
once
again
when
the
river
had
just
increased
its
flow
in
the
rainy
season
and
made
a
powerful
noise
then
said
siddhartha
is
it
so
oh
friend
the
river
has
many
voices
very
many
voices
has
it
the
voice
of
a
king
and
of
a
warrior
and
of
a
bull
and
of
a
bird
of
the
night
and
of
a
woman
giving
birth
and
of
a
sighing
man
and
a
thousand
other
voices
more
so
it
is
vasudeva
nodded
all
voices
of
the
creatures
are
in
its
voice
and
do
you
know
siddhartha
continued
what
word
it
speaks
when
you
succeed
in
hearing
all
of
its
ten
thousand
voices
at
once
happily
vasudeva
face
was
smiling
he
bent
over
to
siddhartha
and
spoke
the
holy
om
into
his
ear
and
this
had
been
the
very
thing
which
siddhartha
had
also
been
hearing
and
time
after
time
his
smile
became
more
similar
to
the
ferryman
became
almost
just
as
bright
almost
just
as
throughly
glowing
with
bliss
just
as
shining
out
of
thousand
small
wrinkles
just
as
alike
to
a
child
just
as
alike
to
an
old
man
many
travellers
seeing
the
two
ferrymen
thought
they
were
brothers
often
they
sat
in
the
evening
together
by
the
bank
on
the
log
said
nothing
and
both
listened
to
the
water
which
was
no
water
to
them
but
the
voice
of
life
the
voice
of
what
exists
of
what
is
eternally
taking
shape
and
it
happened
from
time
to
time
that
both
when
listening
to
the
river
thought
of
the
same
things
of
a
conversation
from
the
day
before
yesterday
of
one
of
their
travellers
the
face
and
fate
of
whom
had
occupied
their
thoughts
of
death
of
their
childhood
and
that
they
both
in
the
same
moment
when
the
river
had
been
saying
something
good
to
them
looked
at
each
other
both
thinking
precisely
the
same
thing
both
delighted
about
the
same
answer
to
the
same
question
there
was
something
about
this
ferry
and
the
two
ferrymen
which
was
transmitted
to
others
which
many
of
the
travellers
felt
it
happened
occasionally
that
a
traveller
after
having
looked
at
the
face
of
one
of
the
ferrymen
started
to
tell
the
story
of
his
life
told
about
pains
confessed
evil
things
asked
for
comfort
and
advice
it
happened
occasionally
that
someone
asked
for
permission
to
stay
for
a
night
with
them
to
listen
to
the
river
it
also
happened
that
curious
people
came
who
had
been
told
that
there
were
two
wise
men
or
sorcerers
or
holy
men
living
by
that
ferry
the
curious
people
asked
many
questions
but
they
got
no
answers
and
they
found
neither
sorcerers
nor
wise
men
they
only
found
two
friendly
little
old
men
who
seemed
to
be
mute
and
to
have
become
a
bit
strange
and
gaga
and
the
curious
people
laughed
and
were
discussing
how
foolishly
and
gullibly
the
common
people
were
spreading
such
empty
rumours
the
years
passed
by
and
nobody
counted
them
then
at
one
time
monks
came
by
on
a
pilgrimage
followers
of
gotama
the
buddha
who
were
asking
to
be
ferried
across
the
river
and
by
them
the
ferrymen
were
told
that
they
were
most
hurriedly
walking
back
to
their
great
teacher
for
the
news
had
spread
the
exalted
one
was
deadly
sick
and
would
soon
die
his
last
human
death
in
order
to
become
one
with
the
salvation
it
was
not
long
until
a
new
flock
of
monks
came
along
on
their
pilgrimage
and
another
one
and
the
monks
as
well
as
most
of
the
other
travellers
and
people
walking
through
the
land
spoke
of
nothing
else
than
of
gotama
and
his
impending
death
and
as
people
are
flocking
from
everywhere
and
from
all
sides
when
they
are
going
to
war
or
to
the
coronation
of
a
king
and
are
gathering
like
ants
in
droves
thus
they
flocked
like
being
drawn
on
by
a
magic
spell
to
where
the
great
buddha
was
awaiting
his
death
where
the
huge
event
was
to
take
place
and
the
great
perfected
one
of
an
era
was
to
become
one
with
the
glory
often
siddhartha
thought
in
those
days
of
the
dying
wise
man
the
great
teacher
whose
voice
had
admonished
nations
and
had
awoken
hundreds
of
thousands
whose
voice
he
had
also
once
heard
whose
holy
face
he
had
also
once
seen
with
respect
kindly
he
thought
of
him
saw
his
path
to
perfection
before
his
eyes
and
remembered
with
a
smile
those
words
which
he
had
once
as
a
young
man
said
to
him
the
exalted
one
they
had
been
so
it
seemed
to
him
proud
and
precocious
words
with
a
smile
he
remembered
them
for
a
long
time
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
standing
between
gotama
and
him
any
more
though
he
was
still
unable
to
accept
his
teachings
no
there
was
no
teaching
a
truly
searching
person
someone
who
truly
wanted
to
find
could
accept
but
he
who
had
found
he
could
approve
of
any
teachings
every
path
every
goal
there
was
nothing
standing
between
him
and
all
the
other
thousand
any
more
who
lived
in
that
what
is
eternal
who
breathed
what
is
divine
on
one
of
these
days
when
so
many
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
dying
buddha
kamala
also
went
to
him
who
used
to
be
the
most
beautiful
of
the
courtesans
a
long
time
ago
she
had
retired
from
her
previous
life
had
given
her
garden
to
the
monks
of
gotama
as
a
gift
had
taken
her
refuge
in
the
teachings
was
among
the
friends
and
benefactors
of
the
pilgrims
together
with
siddhartha
the
boy
her
son
she
had
gone
on
her
way
due
to
the
news
of
the
near
death
of
gotama
in
simple
clothes
on
foot
with
her
little
son
she
was
travelling
by
the
river
but
the
boy
had
soon
grown
tired
desired
to
go
back
home
desired
to
rest
desired
to
eat
became
disobedient
and
started
whining
kamala
often
had
to
take
a
rest
with
him
he
was
accustomed
to
having
his
way
against
her
she
had
to
feed
him
had
to
comfort
him
had
to
scold
him
he
did
not
comprehend
why
he
had
to
go
on
this
exhausting
and
sad
pilgrimage
with
his
mother
to
an
unknown
place
to
a
stranger
who
was
holy
and
about
to
die
so
what
if
he
died
how
did
this
concern
the
boy
the
pilgrims
were
getting
close
to
vasudeva
ferry
when
little
siddhartha
once
again
forced
his
mother
to
rest
she
kamala
herself
had
also
become
tired
and
while
the
boy
was
chewing
a
banana
she
crouched
down
on
the
ground
closed
her
eyes
a
bit
and
rested
but
suddenly
she
uttered
a
wailing
scream
the
boy
looked
at
her
in
fear
and
saw
her
face
having
grown
pale
from
horror
and
from
under
her
dress
a
small
black
snake
fled
by
which
kamala
had
been
bitten
hurriedly
they
now
both
ran
along
the
path
in
order
to
reach
people
and
got
near
to
the
ferry
there
kamala
collapsed
and
was
not
able
to
go
any
further
but
the
boy
started
crying
miserably
only
interrupting
it
to
kiss
and
hug
his
mother
and
she
also
joined
his
loud
screams
for
help
until
the
sound
reached
vasudeva
ears
who
stood
at
the
ferry
quickly
he
came
walking
took
the
woman
on
his
arms
carried
her
into
the
boat
the
boy
ran
along
and
soon
they
all
reached
the
hut
were
siddhartha
stood
by
the
stove
and
was
just
lighting
the
fire
he
looked
up
and
first
saw
the
boy
face
which
wondrously
reminded
him
of
something
like
a
warning
to
remember
something
he
had
forgotten
then
he
saw
kamala
whom
he
instantly
recognised
though
she
lay
unconscious
in
the
ferryman
arms
and
now
he
knew
that
it
was
his
own
son
whose
face
had
been
such
a
warning
reminder
to
him
and
the
heart
stirred
in
his
chest
kamala
wound
was
washed
but
had
already
turned
black
and
her
body
was
swollen
she
was
made
to
drink
a
healing
potion
her
consciousness
returned
she
lay
on
siddhartha
bed
in
the
hut
and
bent
over
her
stood
siddhartha
who
used
to
love
her
so
much
it
seemed
like
a
dream
to
her
with
a
smile
she
looked
at
her
friend
face
just
slowly
she
realized
her
situation
remembered
the
bite
called
timidly
for
the
boy
he
with
you
do
worry
said
siddhartha
kamala
looked
into
his
eyes
she
spoke
with
a
heavy
tongue
paralysed
by
the
poison
you
become
old
my
dear
she
said
you
become
gray
but
you
are
like
the
young
samana
who
at
one
time
came
without
clothes
with
dusty
feet
to
me
into
the
garden
you
are
much
more
like
him
than
you
were
like
him
at
that
time
when
you
had
left
me
and
kamaswami
in
the
eyes
you
like
him
siddhartha
alas
i
have
also
grown
old
old
could
you
still
recognise
me
siddhartha
smiled
instantly
i
recognised
you
kamala
my
dear
kamala
pointed
to
her
boy
and
said
did
you
recognise
him
as
well
he
is
your
son
her
eyes
became
confused
and
fell
shut
the
boy
wept
siddhartha
took
him
on
his
knees
let
him
weep
petted
his
hair
and
at
the
sight
of
the
child
face
a
brahman
prayer
came
to
his
mind
which
he
had
learned
a
long
time
ago
when
he
had
been
a
little
boy
himself
slowly
with
a
singing
voice
he
started
to
speak
from
his
past
and
childhood
the
words
came
flowing
to
him
and
with
that
singsong
the
boy
became
calm
was
only
now
and
then
uttering
a
sob
and
fell
asleep
siddhartha
placed
him
on
vasudeva
bed
vasudeva
stood
by
the
stove
and
cooked
rice
siddhartha
gave
him
a
look
which
he
returned
with
a
smile
she
die
siddhartha
said
quietly
vasudeva
nodded
over
his
friendly
face
ran
the
light
of
the
fire
once
again
kamala
returned
to
consciousness
pain
distorted
her
face
siddhartha
eyes
read
the
suffering
on
her
mouth
on
her
pale
cheeks
quietly
he
read
it
attentively
waiting
his
mind
becoming
one
with
her
suffering
kamala
felt
it
her
gaze
sought
his
eyes
looking
at
him
she
said
now
i
see
that
your
eyes
have
changed
as
well
they
become
completely
different
by
what
do
i
still
recognise
that
you
siddhartha
it
you
and
it
not
you
siddhartha
said
nothing
quietly
his
eyes
looked
at
hers
you
have
achieved
it
she
asked
you
have
found
peace
he
smiled
and
placed
his
hand
on
hers
i
seeing
it
she
said
i
seeing
it
i
too
will
find
peace
you
have
found
it
siddhartha
spoke
in
a
whisper
kamala
never
stopped
looking
into
his
eyes
she
thought
about
her
pilgrimage
to
gotama
which
wanted
to
take
in
order
to
see
the
face
of
the
perfected
one
to
breathe
his
peace
and
she
thought
that
she
had
now
found
him
in
his
place
and
that
it
was
good
just
as
good
as
if
she
had
seen
the
other
one
she
wanted
to
tell
this
to
him
but
the
tongue
no
longer
obeyed
her
will
without
speaking
she
looked
at
him
and
he
saw
the
life
fading
from
her
eyes
when
the
final
pain
filled
her
eyes
and
made
them
grow
dim
when
the
final
shiver
ran
through
her
limbs
his
finger
closed
her
eyelids
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
looked
at
her
peacefully
dead
face
for
a
long
time
he
observed
her
mouth
her
old
tired
mouth
with
those
lips
which
had
become
thin
and
he
remembered
that
he
used
to
in
the
spring
of
his
years
compare
this
mouth
with
a
freshly
cracked
fig
for
a
long
time
he
sat
read
in
the
pale
face
in
the
tired
wrinkles
filled
himself
with
this
sight
saw
his
own
face
lying
in
the
same
manner
just
as
white
just
as
quenched
out
and
saw
at
the
same
time
his
face
and
hers
being
young
with
red
lips
with
fiery
eyes
and
the
feeling
of
this
both
being
present
and
at
the
same
time
real
the
feeling
of
eternity
completely
filled
every
aspect
of
his
being
deeply
he
felt
more
deeply
than
ever
before
in
this
hour
the
indestructibility
of
every
life
the
eternity
of
every
moment
when
he
rose
vasudeva
had
prepared
rice
for
him
but
siddhartha
did
not
eat
in
the
stable
where
their
goat
stood
the
two
old
men
prepared
beds
of
straw
for
themselves
and
vasudeva
lay
himself
down
to
sleep
but
siddhartha
went
outside
and
sat
this
night
before
the
hut
listening
to
the
river
surrounded
by
the
past
touched
and
encircled
by
all
times
of
his
life
at
the
same
time
but
occasionally
he
rose
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
listened
whether
the
boy
was
sleeping
early
in
the
morning
even
before
the
sun
could
be
seen
vasudeva
came
out
of
the
stable
and
walked
over
to
his
friend
you
have
slept
he
said
no
vasudeva
i
sat
here
i
was
listening
to
the
river
a
lot
it
has
told
me
deeply
it
has
filled
me
with
the
healing
thought
with
the
thought
of
oneness
you
experienced
suffering
siddhartha
but
i
see
no
sadness
has
entered
your
heart
no
my
dear
how
should
i
be
sad
i
who
have
been
rich
and
happy
have
become
even
richer
and
happier
now
my
son
has
been
given
to
me
your
son
shall
be
welcome
to
me
as
well
but
now
siddhartha
get
to
work
there
is
much
to
be
done
kamala
has
died
on
the
same
bed
on
which
my
wife
had
died
a
long
time
ago
let
us
also
build
funeral
pile
on
the
same
hill
on
which
i
had
then
built
my
funeral
pile
while
the
boy
was
still
asleep
they
built
the
funeral
pile
the
son
timid
and
weeping
the
boy
had
attended
his
mother
funeral
gloomy
and
shy
he
had
listened
to
siddhartha
who
greeted
him
as
his
son
and
welcomed
him
at
his
place
in
vasudeva
hut
pale
he
sat
for
many
days
by
the
hill
of
the
dead
did
not
want
to
eat
gave
no
open
look
did
not
open
his
heart
met
his
fate
with
resistance
and
denial
siddhartha
spared
him
and
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
he
honoured
his
mourning
siddhartha
understood
that
his
son
did
not
know
him
that
he
could
not
love
him
like
a
father
slowly
he
also
saw
and
understood
that
the
was
a
pampered
boy
a
mother
boy
and
that
he
had
grown
up
in
the
habits
of
rich
people
accustomed
to
finer
food
to
a
soft
bed
accustomed
to
giving
orders
to
servants
siddhartha
understood
that
the
mourning
pampered
child
could
not
suddenly
and
willingly
be
content
with
a
life
among
strangers
and
in
poverty
he
did
not
force
him
he
did
many
a
chore
for
him
always
picked
the
best
piece
of
the
meal
for
him
slowly
he
hoped
to
win
him
over
by
friendly
patience
rich
and
happy
he
had
called
himself
when
the
boy
had
come
to
him
since
time
had
passed
on
in
the
meantime
and
the
boy
remained
a
stranger
and
in
a
gloomy
disposition
since
he
displayed
a
proud
and
stubbornly
disobedient
heart
did
not
want
to
do
any
work
did
not
pay
his
respect
to
the
old
men
stole
from
vasudeva
then
siddhartha
began
to
understand
that
his
son
had
not
brought
him
happiness
and
peace
but
suffering
and
worry
but
he
loved
him
and
he
preferred
the
suffering
and
worries
of
love
over
happiness
and
joy
without
the
boy
since
young
siddhartha
was
in
the
hut
the
old
men
had
split
the
work
vasudeva
had
again
taken
on
the
job
of
the
ferryman
all
by
himself
and
siddhartha
in
order
to
be
with
his
son
did
the
work
in
the
hut
and
the
field
for
a
long
time
for
long
months
siddhartha
waited
for
his
son
to
understand
him
to
accept
his
love
to
perhaps
reciprocate
it
for
long
months
vasudeva
waited
watching
waited
and
said
nothing
one
day
when
siddhartha
the
younger
had
once
again
tormented
his
father
very
much
with
spite
and
an
unsteadiness
in
his
wishes
and
had
broken
both
of
his
vasudeva
took
in
the
evening
his
friend
aside
and
talked
to
him
pardon
me
he
said
from
a
friendly
heart
i
talking
to
you
seeing
that
you
are
tormenting
yourself
i
seeing
that
you
in
grief
your
son
my
dear
is
worrying
you
and
he
is
also
worrying
me
that
young
bird
is
accustomed
to
a
different
life
to
a
different
nest
he
has
not
like
you
ran
away
from
riches
and
the
city
being
disgusted
and
fed
up
with
it
against
his
will
he
had
to
leave
all
this
behind
i
asked
the
river
oh
friend
many
times
i
have
asked
it
but
the
river
laughs
it
laughs
at
me
it
laughs
at
you
and
me
and
is
shaking
with
laughter
at
our
foolishness
water
wants
to
join
water
youth
wants
to
join
youth
your
son
is
not
in
the
place
where
he
can
prosper
you
too
should
ask
the
river
you
too
should
listen
to
it
troubled
siddhartha
looked
into
his
friendly
face
in
the
many
wrinkles
of
which
there
was
incessant
cheerfulness
how
could
i
part
with
him
he
said
quietly
ashamed
give
me
some
more
time
my
dear
see
i
fighting
for
him
i
seeking
to
win
his
heart
with
love
and
with
friendly
patience
i
intent
to
capture
it
one
day
the
river
shall
also
talk
to
him
he
also
is
called
upon
vasudeva
smile
flourished
more
warmly
oh
yes
he
too
is
called
upon
he
too
is
of
the
eternal
life
but
do
we
you
and
me
know
what
he
is
called
upon
to
do
what
path
to
take
what
actions
to
perform
what
pain
to
endure
not
a
small
one
his
pain
will
be
after
all
his
heart
is
proud
and
hard
people
like
this
have
to
suffer
a
lot
err
a
lot
do
much
injustice
burden
themselves
with
much
sin
tell
me
my
dear
you
not
taking
control
of
your
son
upbringing
you
force
him
you
do
beat
him
you
do
punish
him
no
vasudeva
i
do
do
anything
of
this
i
knew
it
you
do
force
him
do
beat
him
do
give
him
orders
because
you
know
that
is
stronger
than
water
stronger
than
rocks
love
stronger
than
force
very
good
i
praise
you
but
are
you
mistaken
in
thinking
that
you
would
force
him
punish
him
do
you
shackle
him
with
your
love
do
you
make
him
feel
inferior
every
day
and
do
you
make
it
even
harder
on
him
with
your
kindness
and
patience
do
you
force
him
the
arrogant
and
pampered
boy
to
live
in
a
hut
with
two
old
to
whom
even
rice
is
a
delicacy
whose
thoughts
ca
be
his
whose
hearts
are
old
and
quiet
and
beats
in
a
different
pace
than
his
is
forced
he
punished
by
all
this
troubled
siddhartha
looked
to
the
ground
quietly
he
asked
what
do
you
think
should
i
do
quoth
vasudeva
bring
him
into
the
city
bring
him
into
his
house
there
still
be
servants
around
give
him
to
them
and
when
there
are
any
around
any
more
bring
him
to
a
teacher
not
for
the
teachings
sake
but
so
that
he
shall
be
among
other
boys
and
among
girls
and
in
the
world
which
is
his
own
have
you
never
thought
of
this
you
seeing
into
my
heart
siddhartha
spoke
sadly
often
i
have
thought
of
this
but
look
how
shall
i
put
him
who
had
no
tender
heart
anyhow
into
this
world
wo
he
become
exuberant
wo
he
lose
himself
to
pleasure
and
power
wo
he
repeat
all
of
his
mistakes
wo
he
perhaps
get
entirely
lost
in
sansara
brightly
the
ferryman
smile
lit
up
softly
he
touched
arm
and
said
ask
the
river
about
it
my
friend
hear
it
laugh
about
it
would
you
actually
believe
that
you
had
committed
your
foolish
acts
in
order
to
spare
your
son
from
committing
them
too
and
could
you
in
any
way
protect
your
son
from
sansara
how
could
you
by
means
of
teachings
prayer
admonition
my
dear
have
you
entirely
forgotten
that
story
that
story
containing
so
many
lessons
that
story
about
siddhartha
a
brahman
son
which
you
once
told
me
here
on
this
very
spot
who
has
kept
the
samana
siddhartha
safe
from
sansara
from
sin
from
greed
from
foolishness
were
his
father
religious
devotion
his
teachers
warnings
his
own
knowledge
his
own
search
able
to
keep
him
safe
which
father
which
teacher
had
been
able
to
protect
him
from
living
his
life
for
himself
from
soiling
himself
with
life
from
burdening
himself
with
guilt
from
drinking
the
bitter
drink
for
himself
from
finding
his
path
for
himself
would
you
think
my
dear
anybody
might
perhaps
be
spared
from
taking
this
path
that
perhaps
your
little
son
would
be
spared
because
you
love
him
because
you
would
like
to
keep
him
from
suffering
and
pain
and
disappointment
but
even
if
you
would
die
ten
times
for
him
you
would
not
be
able
to
take
the
slightest
part
of
his
destiny
upon
yourself
never
before
vasudeva
had
spoken
so
many
words
kindly
siddhartha
thanked
him
went
troubled
into
the
hut
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
vasudeva
had
told
him
nothing
he
had
not
already
thought
and
known
for
himself
but
this
was
a
knowledge
he
could
not
act
upon
stronger
than
the
knowledge
was
his
love
for
the
boy
stronger
was
his
tenderness
his
fear
to
lose
him
had
he
ever
lost
his
heart
so
much
to
something
had
he
ever
loved
any
person
thus
thus
blindly
thus
sufferingly
thus
unsuccessfully
and
yet
thus
happily
siddhartha
could
not
heed
his
friend
advice
he
could
not
give
up
the
boy
he
let
the
boy
give
him
orders
he
let
him
disregard
him
he
said
nothing
and
waited
daily
he
began
the
mute
struggle
of
friendliness
the
silent
war
of
patience
vasudeva
also
said
nothing
and
waited
friendly
knowing
patient
they
were
both
masters
of
patience
at
one
time
when
the
boy
face
reminded
him
very
much
of
kamala
siddhartha
suddenly
had
to
think
of
a
line
which
kamala
a
long
time
ago
in
the
days
of
their
youth
had
once
said
to
him
you
can
not
love
she
had
said
to
him
and
he
had
agreed
with
her
and
had
compared
himself
with
a
star
while
comparing
the
childlike
people
with
falling
leaves
and
nevertheless
he
had
also
sensed
an
accusation
in
that
line
indeed
he
had
never
been
able
to
lose
or
devote
himself
completely
to
another
person
to
forget
himself
to
commit
foolish
acts
for
the
love
of
another
person
never
he
had
been
able
to
do
this
and
this
was
as
it
had
seemed
to
him
at
that
time
the
great
distinction
which
set
him
apart
from
the
childlike
people
but
now
since
his
son
was
here
now
he
siddhartha
had
also
become
completely
a
childlike
person
suffering
for
the
sake
of
another
person
loving
another
person
lost
to
a
love
having
become
a
fool
on
account
of
love
now
he
too
felt
late
once
in
his
lifetime
this
strongest
and
strangest
of
all
passions
suffered
from
it
suffered
miserably
and
was
nevertheless
in
bliss
was
nevertheless
renewed
in
one
respect
enriched
by
one
thing
he
did
sense
very
well
that
this
love
this
blind
love
for
his
son
was
a
passion
something
very
human
that
it
was
sansara
a
murky
source
dark
waters
nevertheless
he
felt
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
worthless
it
was
necessary
came
from
the
essence
of
his
own
being
this
pleasure
also
had
to
be
atoned
for
this
pain
also
had
to
be
endured
these
foolish
acts
also
had
to
be
committed
through
all
this
the
son
let
him
commit
his
foolish
acts
let
him
court
for
his
affection
let
him
humiliate
himself
every
day
by
giving
in
to
his
moods
this
father
had
nothing
which
would
have
delighted
him
and
nothing
which
he
would
have
feared
he
was
a
good
man
this
father
a
good
kind
soft
man
perhaps
a
very
devout
man
perhaps
a
saint
all
these
there
no
attributes
which
could
win
the
boy
over
he
was
bored
by
this
father
who
kept
him
prisoner
here
in
this
miserable
hut
of
his
he
was
bored
by
him
and
for
him
to
answer
every
naughtiness
with
a
smile
every
insult
with
friendliness
every
viciousness
with
kindness
this
very
thing
was
the
hated
trick
of
this
old
sneak
much
more
the
boy
would
have
liked
it
if
he
had
been
threatened
by
him
if
he
had
been
abused
by
him
a
day
came
when
what
young
siddhartha
had
on
his
mind
came
bursting
forth
and
he
openly
turned
against
his
father
the
latter
had
given
him
a
task
he
had
told
him
to
gather
brushwood
but
the
boy
did
not
leave
the
hut
in
stubborn
disobedience
and
rage
he
stayed
where
he
was
thumped
on
the
ground
with
his
feet
clenched
his
fists
and
screamed
in
a
powerful
outburst
his
hatred
and
contempt
into
his
father
face
get
the
brushwood
for
yourself
he
shouted
foaming
at
the
mouth
not
your
servant
i
do
know
that
you
wo
hit
me
you
do
dare
i
do
know
that
you
constantly
want
to
punish
me
and
put
me
down
with
your
religious
devotion
and
your
indulgence
you
want
me
to
become
like
you
just
as
devout
just
as
soft
just
as
wise
but
i
listen
up
just
to
make
you
suffer
i
rather
want
to
become
a
and
murderer
and
go
to
hell
than
to
become
like
you
i
hate
you
not
my
father
and
if
you
ten
times
been
my
mother
fornicator
rage
and
grief
boiled
over
in
him
foamed
at
the
father
in
a
hundred
savage
and
evil
words
then
the
boy
ran
away
and
only
returned
late
at
night
but
the
next
morning
he
had
disappeared
what
had
also
disappeared
was
a
small
basket
woven
out
of
bast
of
two
colours
in
which
the
ferrymen
kept
those
copper
and
silver
coins
which
they
received
as
a
fare
the
boat
had
also
disappeared
siddhartha
saw
it
lying
by
the
opposite
bank
the
boy
had
ran
away
i
must
follow
him
said
siddhartha
who
had
been
shivering
with
grief
since
those
ranting
speeches
the
boy
had
made
yesterday
a
child
ca
go
through
the
forest
all
alone
he
perish
we
must
build
a
raft
vasudeva
to
get
over
the
water
we
will
build
a
raft
said
vasudeva
to
get
our
boat
back
which
the
boy
has
taken
away
but
him
you
shall
let
run
along
my
friend
he
is
no
child
any
more
he
knows
how
to
get
around
he
looking
for
the
path
to
the
city
and
he
is
right
do
forget
that
he
doing
what
you
failed
to
do
yourself
he
taking
care
of
himself
he
taking
his
course
alas
siddhartha
i
see
you
suffering
but
you
suffering
a
pain
at
which
one
would
like
to
laugh
at
which
you
soon
laugh
for
yourself
siddhartha
did
not
answer
he
already
held
the
axe
in
his
hands
and
began
to
make
a
raft
of
bamboo
and
vasudeva
helped
him
to
tie
the
canes
together
with
ropes
of
grass
then
they
crossed
over
drifted
far
off
their
course
pulled
the
raft
upriver
on
the
opposite
bank
why
did
you
take
the
axe
along
asked
siddhartha
vasudeva
said
it
might
have
been
possible
that
the
oar
of
our
boat
got
lost
but
siddhartha
knew
what
his
friend
was
thinking
he
thought
the
boy
would
have
thrown
away
or
broken
the
oar
in
order
to
get
even
and
in
order
to
keep
them
from
following
him
and
in
fact
there
was
no
oar
left
in
the
boat
vasudeva
pointed
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
looked
at
his
friend
with
a
smile
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
do
you
see
what
your
son
is
trying
to
tell
you
do
you
see
that
he
does
want
to
be
followed
but
he
did
not
say
this
in
words
he
started
making
a
new
oar
but
siddhartha
bid
his
farewell
to
look
for
the
vasudeva
did
not
stop
him
when
siddhartha
had
already
been
walking
through
the
forest
for
a
long
time
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
his
search
was
useless
either
so
he
thought
the
boy
was
far
ahead
and
had
already
reached
the
city
or
if
he
should
still
be
on
his
way
he
would
conceal
himself
from
him
the
pursuer
as
he
continued
thinking
he
also
found
that
he
on
his
part
was
not
worried
for
his
son
that
he
knew
deep
inside
that
he
had
neither
perished
nor
was
in
any
danger
in
the
forest
nevertheless
he
ran
without
stopping
no
longer
to
save
him
just
to
satisfy
his
desire
just
to
perhaps
see
him
one
more
time
and
he
ran
up
to
just
outside
of
the
city
when
near
the
city
he
reached
a
wide
road
he
stopped
by
the
entrance
of
the
beautiful
which
used
to
belong
to
kamala
where
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
the
past
rose
up
in
his
soul
again
he
saw
himself
standing
there
young
a
bearded
naked
samana
the
hair
full
of
dust
for
a
long
time
siddhartha
stood
there
and
looked
through
the
open
gate
into
the
garden
seeing
monks
in
yellow
robes
walking
among
the
beautiful
trees
for
a
long
time
he
stood
there
pondering
seeing
images
listening
to
the
story
of
his
life
for
a
long
time
he
stood
there
looked
at
the
monks
saw
young
siddhartha
in
their
place
saw
young
kamala
walking
among
the
high
trees
clearly
he
saw
himself
being
served
food
and
drink
by
kamala
receiving
his
first
kiss
from
her
looking
proudly
and
disdainfully
back
on
his
brahmanism
beginning
proudly
and
full
of
desire
his
worldly
life
he
saw
kamaswami
saw
the
servants
the
orgies
the
gamblers
with
the
dice
the
musicians
saw
in
the
cage
lived
through
all
this
once
again
breathed
sansara
was
once
again
old
and
tired
felt
once
again
disgust
felt
once
again
the
wish
to
annihilate
himself
was
once
again
healed
by
the
holy
om
after
having
been
standing
by
the
gate
of
the
garden
for
a
long
time
siddhartha
realised
that
his
desire
was
foolish
which
had
made
him
go
up
to
this
place
that
he
could
not
help
his
son
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
cling
him
deeply
he
felt
the
love
for
the
in
his
heart
like
a
wound
and
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
this
wound
had
not
been
given
to
him
in
order
to
turn
the
knife
in
it
that
it
had
to
become
a
blossom
and
had
to
shine
that
this
wound
did
not
blossom
yet
did
not
shine
yet
at
this
hour
made
him
sad
instead
of
the
desired
goal
which
had
drawn
him
here
following
the
runaway
son
there
was
now
emptiness
sadly
he
sat
down
felt
something
dying
in
his
heart
experienced
emptiness
saw
no
joy
any
more
no
goal
he
sat
lost
in
thought
and
waited
this
he
had
learned
by
the
river
this
one
thing
waiting
having
patience
listening
attentively
and
he
sat
and
listened
in
the
dust
of
the
road
listened
to
his
heart
beating
tiredly
and
sadly
waited
for
a
voice
many
an
hour
he
crouched
listening
saw
no
images
any
more
fell
into
emptiness
let
himself
fall
without
seeing
a
path
and
when
he
felt
the
wound
burning
he
silently
spoke
the
om
filled
himself
with
om
the
monks
in
the
garden
saw
him
and
since
he
crouched
for
many
hours
and
dust
was
gathering
on
his
gray
hair
one
of
them
came
to
him
and
placed
two
bananas
in
front
of
him
the
old
man
did
not
see
him
from
this
petrified
state
he
was
awoken
by
a
hand
touching
his
shoulder
instantly
he
recognised
this
touch
this
tender
bashful
touch
and
regained
his
senses
he
rose
and
greeted
vasudeva
who
had
followed
him
and
when
he
looked
into
vasudeva
friendly
face
into
the
small
wrinkles
which
were
as
if
they
were
filled
with
nothing
but
his
smile
into
the
happy
eyes
then
he
smiled
too
now
he
saw
the
bananas
lying
in
front
of
him
picked
them
up
gave
one
to
the
ferryman
ate
the
other
one
himself
after
this
he
silently
went
back
into
the
forest
with
vasudeva
returned
home
to
the
ferry
neither
one
talked
about
what
had
happened
today
neither
one
mentioned
the
boy
name
neither
one
spoke
about
him
running
away
neither
one
spoke
about
the
wound
in
the
hut
siddhartha
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
when
after
a
while
vasudeva
came
to
him
to
offer
him
a
bowl
of
he
already
found
him
asleep
om
for
a
long
time
the
wound
continued
to
burn
many
a
traveller
siddhartha
had
to
ferry
across
the
river
who
was
accompanied
by
a
son
or
a
daughter
and
he
saw
none
of
them
without
envying
him
without
thinking
so
many
so
many
thousands
possess
this
sweetest
of
good
fortunes
why
do
i
even
bad
people
even
thieves
and
robbers
have
children
and
love
them
and
are
being
loved
by
them
all
except
for
me
thus
simply
thus
without
reason
he
now
thought
thus
similar
to
the
childlike
people
he
had
become
differently
than
before
he
now
looked
upon
people
less
smart
less
proud
but
instead
warmer
more
curious
more
involved
when
he
ferried
travellers
of
the
ordinary
kind
childlike
people
businessmen
warriors
women
these
people
did
not
seem
alien
to
him
as
they
used
to
he
understood
them
he
understood
and
shared
their
life
which
was
not
guided
by
thoughts
and
insight
but
solely
by
urges
and
wishes
he
felt
like
them
though
he
was
near
perfection
and
was
bearing
his
final
wound
it
still
seemed
to
him
as
if
those
childlike
people
were
his
brothers
their
vanities
desires
for
possession
and
ridiculous
aspects
were
no
longer
ridiculous
to
him
became
understandable
became
lovable
even
became
worthy
of
veneration
to
him
the
blind
love
of
a
mother
for
her
child
the
stupid
blind
pride
of
a
conceited
father
for
his
only
son
the
blind
wild
desire
of
a
young
vain
woman
for
jewelry
and
admiring
glances
from
men
all
of
these
urges
all
of
this
childish
stuff
all
of
these
simple
foolish
but
immensely
strong
strongly
living
strongly
prevailing
urges
and
desires
were
now
no
childish
notions
for
siddhartha
any
more
he
saw
people
living
for
their
sake
saw
them
achieving
infinitely
much
for
their
sake
travelling
conducting
wars
suffering
infinitely
much
bearing
infinitely
much
and
he
could
love
them
for
it
he
saw
life
that
what
is
alive
the
indestructible
the
brahman
in
each
of
their
passions
each
of
their
acts
worthy
of
love
and
admiration
were
these
people
in
their
blind
loyalty
their
blind
strength
and
tenacity
they
lacked
nothing
there
was
nothing
the
knowledgeable
one
the
thinker
had
to
put
him
above
them
except
for
one
little
thing
a
single
tiny
small
thing
the
consciousness
the
conscious
thought
of
the
oneness
of
all
life
and
siddhartha
even
doubted
in
many
an
hour
whether
this
knowledge
this
thought
was
to
be
valued
thus
highly
whether
it
might
not
also
perhaps
be
a
childish
idea
of
the
thinking
people
of
the
thinking
and
childlike
people
in
all
other
respects
the
worldly
people
were
of
equal
rank
to
the
wise
men
were
often
far
superior
to
them
just
as
animals
too
can
after
all
in
some
moments
seem
to
be
superior
to
humans
in
their
tough
unrelenting
performance
of
what
is
necessary
slowly
blossomed
slowly
ripened
in
siddhartha
the
realisation
the
knowledge
what
wisdom
actually
was
what
the
goal
of
his
long
search
was
it
was
nothing
but
a
readiness
of
the
soul
an
ability
a
secret
art
to
think
every
moment
while
living
his
life
the
thought
of
oneness
to
be
able
to
feel
and
inhale
the
oneness
slowly
this
blossomed
in
him
was
shining
back
at
him
from
vasudeva
old
childlike
face
harmony
knowledge
of
the
eternal
perfection
of
the
world
smiling
oneness
but
the
wound
still
burned
longingly
and
bitterly
siddhartha
thought
of
his
son
nurtured
his
love
and
tenderness
in
his
heart
allowed
the
pain
to
gnaw
at
him
committed
all
foolish
acts
of
love
not
by
itself
this
flame
would
go
out
and
one
day
when
the
wound
burned
violently
siddhartha
ferried
across
the
river
driven
by
a
yearning
got
off
the
boat
and
was
willing
to
go
to
the
city
and
to
look
for
his
son
the
river
flowed
softly
and
quietly
it
was
the
dry
season
but
its
voice
sounded
strange
it
laughed
it
laughed
clearly
the
river
laughed
it
laughed
brightly
and
clearly
at
the
old
ferryman
siddhartha
stopped
he
bent
over
the
water
in
order
to
hear
even
better
and
he
saw
his
face
reflected
in
the
quietly
moving
waters
and
in
this
reflected
face
there
was
something
which
reminded
him
something
he
had
forgotten
and
as
he
thought
about
it
he
found
it
this
face
resembled
another
face
which
he
used
to
know
and
love
and
also
fear
it
resembled
his
father
face
the
brahman
and
he
remembered
how
he
a
long
time
ago
as
a
young
man
had
forced
his
father
to
let
him
go
to
the
penitents
how
he
had
bed
his
farewell
to
him
how
he
had
gone
and
had
never
come
back
had
his
father
not
also
suffered
the
same
pain
for
him
which
he
now
suffered
for
his
son
had
his
father
not
long
since
died
alone
without
having
seen
his
son
again
did
he
not
have
to
expect
the
same
fate
for
himself
was
it
not
a
comedy
a
strange
and
stupid
matter
this
repetition
this
running
around
in
a
fateful
circle
the
river
laughed
yes
so
it
was
everything
came
back
which
had
not
been
suffered
and
solved
up
to
its
end
the
same
pain
was
suffered
over
and
over
again
but
siddhartha
want
back
into
the
boat
and
ferried
back
to
the
hut
thinking
of
his
father
thinking
of
his
son
laughed
at
by
the
river
at
odds
with
himself
tending
towards
despair
and
not
less
tending
towards
laughing
along
at
über
himself
and
the
entire
world
alas
the
wound
was
not
blossoming
yet
his
heart
was
still
fighting
his
fate
cheerfulness
and
victory
were
not
yet
shining
from
his
suffering
nevertheless
he
felt
hope
and
once
he
had
returned
to
the
hut
he
felt
an
undefeatable
desire
to
open
up
to
vasudeva
to
show
him
everything
the
master
of
listening
to
say
everything
vasudeva
was
sitting
in
the
hut
and
weaving
a
basket
he
no
longer
used
the
his
eyes
were
starting
to
get
weak
and
not
just
his
eyes
his
arms
and
hands
as
well
unchanged
and
flourishing
was
only
the
joy
and
the
cheerful
benevolence
of
his
face
siddhartha
sat
down
next
to
the
old
man
slowly
he
started
talking
what
they
had
never
talked
about
he
now
told
him
of
of
his
walk
to
the
city
at
that
time
of
the
burning
wound
of
his
envy
at
the
sight
of
happy
fathers
of
his
knowledge
of
the
foolishness
of
such
wishes
of
his
futile
fight
against
them
he
reported
everything
he
was
able
to
say
everything
even
the
most
embarrassing
parts
everything
could
be
said
everything
shown
everything
he
could
tell
he
presented
his
wound
also
told
how
he
fled
today
how
he
ferried
across
the
water
a
childish
willing
to
walk
to
the
city
how
the
river
had
laughed
while
he
spoke
spoke
for
a
long
time
while
vasudeva
was
listening
with
a
quiet
face
vasudeva
listening
gave
siddhartha
a
stronger
sensation
than
ever
before
he
sensed
how
his
pain
his
fears
flowed
over
to
him
how
his
secret
hope
flowed
over
came
back
at
him
from
his
counterpart
to
show
his
wound
to
this
listener
was
the
same
as
bathing
it
in
the
river
until
it
had
cooled
and
become
one
with
the
river
while
he
was
still
speaking
still
admitting
and
confessing
siddhartha
felt
more
and
more
that
this
was
no
longer
vasudeva
no
longer
a
human
being
who
was
listening
to
him
that
this
motionless
listener
was
absorbing
his
confession
into
himself
like
a
tree
the
rain
that
this
motionless
man
was
the
river
itself
that
he
was
god
himself
that
he
was
the
eternal
itself
and
while
siddhartha
stopped
thinking
of
himself
and
his
wound
this
realisation
of
vasudeva
changed
character
took
possession
of
him
and
the
more
he
felt
it
and
entered
into
it
the
less
wondrous
it
became
the
more
he
realised
that
everything
was
in
order
and
natural
that
vasudeva
had
already
been
like
this
for
a
long
time
almost
forever
that
only
he
had
not
quite
recognised
it
yes
that
he
himself
had
almost
reached
the
same
state
he
felt
that
he
was
now
seeing
old
vasudeva
as
the
people
see
the
gods
and
that
this
could
not
last
in
his
heart
he
started
bidding
his
farewell
to
vasudeva
thoroughout
all
this
he
talked
incessantly
when
he
had
finished
talking
vasudeva
turned
his
friendly
eyes
which
had
grown
slightly
weak
at
him
said
nothing
let
his
silent
love
and
cheerfulness
understanding
and
knowledge
shine
at
him
he
took
siddhartha
hand
led
him
to
the
seat
by
the
bank
sat
down
with
him
smiled
at
the
river
you
heard
it
laugh
he
said
but
you
have
heard
everything
let
listen
you
hear
more
they
listened
softly
sounded
the
river
singing
in
many
voices
siddhartha
looked
into
the
water
and
images
appeared
to
him
in
the
moving
water
his
father
appeared
lonely
mourning
for
his
son
he
himself
appeared
lonely
he
also
being
tied
with
the
bondage
of
yearning
to
his
distant
son
his
son
appeared
lonely
as
well
the
boy
greedily
rushing
along
the
burning
course
of
his
young
wishes
each
one
heading
for
his
goal
each
one
obsessed
by
the
goal
each
one
suffering
the
river
sang
with
a
voice
of
suffering
longingly
it
sang
longingly
it
flowed
towards
its
goal
lamentingly
its
voice
sang
do
you
hear
vasudeva
mute
gaze
asked
siddhartha
nodded
listen
better
vasudeva
whispered
siddhartha
made
an
effort
to
listen
better
the
image
of
his
father
his
own
image
the
image
of
his
son
merged
kamala
image
also
appeared
and
was
dispersed
and
the
image
of
govinda
and
other
images
and
they
merged
with
each
other
turned
all
into
the
river
headed
all
being
the
river
for
the
goal
longing
desiring
suffering
and
the
river
voice
sounded
full
of
yearning
full
of
burning
woe
full
of
unsatisfiable
desire
for
the
goal
the
river
was
heading
siddhartha
saw
it
hurrying
the
river
which
consisted
of
him
and
his
loved
ones
and
of
all
people
he
had
ever
seen
all
of
these
waves
and
waters
were
hurrying
suffering
towards
goals
many
goals
the
waterfall
the
lake
the
rapids
the
sea
and
all
goals
were
reached
and
every
goal
was
followed
by
a
new
one
and
the
water
turned
into
vapour
and
rose
to
the
sky
turned
into
rain
and
poured
down
from
the
sky
turned
into
a
source
a
stream
a
river
headed
forward
once
again
flowed
on
once
again
but
the
longing
voice
had
changed
it
still
resounded
full
of
suffering
searching
but
other
voices
joined
it
voices
of
joy
and
of
suffering
good
and
bad
voices
laughing
and
sad
ones
a
hundred
voices
a
thousand
voices
siddhartha
listened
he
was
now
nothing
but
a
listener
completely
concentrated
on
listening
completely
empty
he
felt
that
he
had
now
finished
learning
to
listen
often
before
he
had
heard
all
this
these
many
voices
in
the
river
today
it
sounded
new
already
he
could
no
longer
tell
the
many
voices
apart
not
the
happy
ones
from
the
weeping
ones
not
the
ones
of
children
from
those
of
men
they
all
belonged
together
the
lamentation
of
yearning
and
the
laughter
of
the
knowledgeable
one
the
scream
of
rage
and
the
moaning
of
the
dying
ones
everything
was
one
everything
was
intertwined
and
connected
entangled
a
thousand
times
and
everything
together
all
voices
all
goals
all
yearning
all
suffering
all
pleasure
all
that
was
good
and
evil
all
of
this
together
was
the
world
all
of
it
together
was
the
flow
of
events
was
the
music
of
life
and
when
siddhartha
was
listening
attentively
to
this
river
this
song
of
a
thousand
voices
when
he
neither
listened
to
the
suffering
nor
the
laughter
when
he
did
not
tie
his
soul
to
any
particular
voice
and
submerged
his
self
into
it
but
when
he
heard
them
all
perceived
the
whole
the
oneness
then
the
great
song
of
the
thousand
voices
consisted
of
a
single
word
which
was
om
the
perfection
do
you
hear
vasudeva
gaze
asked
again
brightly
vasudeva
smile
was
shining
floating
radiantly
over
all
the
wrinkles
of
his
old
face
as
the
om
was
floating
in
the
air
over
all
the
voices
of
the
river
brightly
his
smile
was
shining
when
he
looked
at
his
friend
and
brightly
the
same
smile
was
now
starting
to
shine
on
siddhartha
face
as
well
his
wound
blossomed
his
suffering
was
shining
his
self
had
flown
into
the
oneness
in
this
hour
siddhartha
stopped
fighting
his
fate
stopped
suffering
on
his
face
flourished
the
cheerfulness
of
a
knowledge
which
is
no
longer
opposed
by
any
will
which
knows
perfection
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
flow
of
events
with
the
current
of
life
full
of
sympathy
for
the
pain
of
others
full
of
sympathy
for
the
pleasure
of
others
devoted
to
the
flow
belonging
to
the
oneness
when
vasudeva
rose
from
the
seat
by
the
bank
when
he
looked
into
siddhartha
eyes
and
saw
the
cheerfulness
of
the
knowledge
shining
in
them
he
softly
touched
his
shoulder
with
his
hand
in
this
careful
and
tender
manner
and
said
i
been
waiting
for
this
hour
my
dear
now
that
it
has
come
let
me
leave
for
a
long
time
i
been
waiting
for
this
hour
for
a
long
time
i
been
vasudeva
the
ferryman
now
it
enough
farewell
hut
farewell
river
farewell
siddhartha
siddhartha
made
a
deep
bow
before
him
who
bid
his
farewell
i
known
it
he
said
quietly
you
go
into
the
forests
i
going
into
the
forests
i
going
into
the
oneness
spoke
vasudeva
with
a
bright
smile
with
a
bright
smile
he
left
siddhartha
watched
him
leaving
with
deep
joy
with
deep
solemnity
he
watched
him
leave
saw
his
steps
full
of
peace
saw
his
head
full
of
lustre
saw
his
body
full
of
light
govinda
together
with
other
monks
govinda
used
to
spend
the
time
of
rest
between
pilgrimages
in
the
which
the
courtesan
kamala
had
given
to
the
followers
of
gotama
for
a
gift
he
heard
talk
of
an
old
ferryman
who
lived
one
day
journey
away
by
the
river
and
who
was
regarded
as
a
wise
man
by
many
when
govinda
went
back
on
his
way
he
chose
the
path
to
the
ferry
eager
to
see
the
ferryman
because
though
he
had
lived
his
entire
life
by
the
rules
though
he
was
also
looked
upon
with
veneration
by
the
younger
monks
on
account
of
his
age
and
his
modesty
the
restlessness
and
the
searching
still
had
not
perished
from
his
heart
he
came
to
the
river
and
asked
the
old
man
to
ferry
him
over
and
when
they
got
off
the
boat
on
the
other
side
he
said
to
the
old
man
you
very
good
to
us
monks
and
pilgrims
you
have
already
ferried
many
of
us
across
the
river
are
you
too
ferryman
a
searcher
for
the
right
path
quoth
siddhartha
smiling
from
his
old
eyes
do
you
call
yourself
a
searcher
oh
venerable
one
though
you
are
already
of
an
old
in
years
and
are
wearing
the
robe
of
gotama
monks
it
true
i
old
spoke
govinda
but
i
have
stopped
searching
never
i
stop
searching
this
seems
to
be
my
destiny
you
too
so
it
seems
to
me
have
been
searching
would
you
like
to
tell
me
something
oh
honourable
one
quoth
siddhartha
what
should
i
possibly
have
to
tell
you
oh
venerable
one
perhaps
that
you
searching
far
too
much
that
in
all
that
searching
you
do
find
the
time
for
finding
how
come
asked
govinda
when
someone
is
searching
said
siddhartha
then
it
might
easily
happen
that
the
only
thing
his
eyes
still
see
is
that
what
he
searches
for
that
he
is
unable
to
find
anything
to
let
anything
enter
his
mind
because
he
always
thinks
of
nothing
but
the
object
of
his
search
because
he
has
a
goal
because
he
is
obsessed
by
the
goal
searching
means
having
a
goal
but
finding
means
being
free
being
open
having
no
goal
you
oh
venerable
one
are
perhaps
indeed
a
searcher
because
striving
for
your
goal
there
are
many
things
you
do
see
which
are
directly
in
front
of
your
eyes
i
do
quite
understand
yet
asked
govinda
what
do
you
mean
by
this
quoth
siddhartha
a
long
time
ago
oh
venerable
one
many
years
ago
you
once
before
been
at
this
river
and
have
found
a
sleeping
man
by
the
river
and
have
sat
down
with
him
to
guard
his
sleep
but
oh
govinda
you
did
not
recognise
the
sleeping
man
astonished
as
if
he
had
been
the
object
of
a
magic
spell
the
monk
looked
into
the
ferryman
eyes
are
you
siddhartha
he
asked
with
a
timid
voice
i
would
have
recognised
you
this
time
as
well
from
my
heart
i
greeting
you
siddhartha
from
my
heart
i
happy
to
see
you
once
again
changed
a
lot
my
and
so
you
now
become
a
ferryman
in
a
friendly
manner
siddhartha
laughed
a
ferryman
yes
many
people
govinda
have
to
change
a
lot
have
to
wear
many
a
robe
i
am
one
of
those
my
dear
be
welcome
govinda
and
spend
the
night
in
my
hut
govinda
stayed
the
night
in
the
hut
and
slept
on
the
bed
which
used
to
be
vasudeva
bed
many
questions
he
posed
to
the
friend
of
his
youth
many
things
siddhartha
had
to
tell
him
from
his
life
when
in
the
next
morning
the
time
had
come
to
start
the
day
journey
govinda
said
not
without
hesitation
these
words
before
continue
on
my
path
siddhartha
permit
me
to
ask
one
more
question
do
you
have
a
teaching
do
you
have
a
faith
or
a
knowledge
you
follow
which
helps
you
to
live
and
to
do
right
quoth
siddhartha
you
know
my
dear
that
i
already
as
a
young
man
in
those
days
when
we
lived
with
the
penitents
in
the
forest
started
to
distrust
teachers
and
teachings
and
to
turn
my
back
to
them
i
have
stuck
with
this
nevertheless
i
have
had
many
teachers
since
then
a
beautiful
courtesan
has
been
my
teacher
for
a
long
time
and
a
rich
merchant
was
my
teacher
and
some
gamblers
with
dice
once
even
a
follower
of
buddha
travelling
on
foot
has
been
my
teacher
he
sat
with
me
when
i
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
forest
on
the
pilgrimage
i
also
learned
from
him
i
also
grateful
to
him
very
grateful
but
most
of
all
i
have
learned
here
from
this
river
and
from
my
predecessor
the
ferryman
vasudeva
he
was
a
very
simple
person
vasudeva
he
was
no
thinker
but
he
knew
what
is
necessary
just
as
well
as
gotama
he
was
a
perfect
man
a
saint
govinda
said
still
oh
siddhartha
you
love
a
bit
to
mock
people
as
it
seems
to
me
i
believe
in
you
and
know
that
you
have
followed
a
teacher
but
have
you
found
something
by
yourself
though
found
no
teachings
you
still
found
certain
thoughts
certain
insights
which
are
your
own
and
which
help
you
to
live
if
you
would
like
to
tell
me
some
of
these
you
would
delight
my
heart
quoth
siddhartha
i
had
thoughts
yes
and
insight
again
and
again
sometimes
for
an
hour
or
for
an
entire
day
i
have
felt
knowledge
in
me
as
one
would
feel
life
in
one
heart
there
have
been
many
thoughts
but
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
convey
them
to
you
look
my
dear
govinda
this
is
one
of
my
thoughts
which
i
have
found
wisdom
can
not
be
passed
on
wisdom
which
a
wise
man
tries
to
pass
on
to
someone
always
sounds
like
foolishness
are
you
kidding
asked
govinda
i
not
kidding
i
telling
you
what
i
found
knowledge
can
be
conveyed
but
not
wisdom
it
can
be
found
it
can
be
lived
it
is
possible
to
be
carried
by
it
miracles
can
be
performed
with
it
but
it
can
not
be
expressed
in
words
and
taught
this
was
what
i
even
as
a
young
man
sometimes
suspected
what
has
driven
me
away
from
the
teachers
i
have
found
a
thought
govinda
which
you
again
regard
as
a
joke
or
foolishness
but
which
is
my
best
thought
it
says
the
opposite
of
every
truth
is
just
as
true
that
like
this
any
truth
can
only
be
expressed
and
put
into
words
when
it
is
everything
is
which
can
be
thought
with
thoughts
and
said
with
words
it
all
all
just
one
half
all
lacks
completeness
roundness
oneness
when
the
exalted
gotama
spoke
in
his
teachings
of
the
world
he
had
to
divide
it
into
sansara
and
nirvana
into
deception
and
truth
into
suffering
and
salvation
it
can
not
be
done
differently
there
is
no
other
way
for
him
who
wants
to
teach
but
the
world
itself
what
exists
around
us
and
inside
of
us
is
never
a
person
or
an
act
is
never
entirely
sansara
or
entirely
nirvana
a
person
is
never
entirely
holy
or
entirely
sinful
it
does
really
seem
like
this
because
we
are
subject
to
deception
as
if
time
was
something
real
time
is
not
real
govinda
i
have
experienced
this
often
and
often
again
and
if
time
is
not
real
then
the
gap
which
seems
to
be
between
the
world
and
the
eternity
between
suffering
and
blissfulness
between
evil
and
good
is
also
a
deception
how
come
asked
govinda
timidly
listen
well
my
dear
listen
well
the
sinner
which
i
am
and
which
you
are
is
a
sinner
but
in
times
to
come
he
will
be
brahma
again
he
will
reach
the
nirvana
will
be
buddha
and
now
see
these
to
come
are
a
deception
are
only
a
parable
the
sinner
is
not
on
his
way
to
become
a
buddha
he
is
not
in
the
process
of
developing
though
our
capacity
for
thinking
does
not
know
how
else
to
picture
these
things
no
within
the
sinner
is
now
and
today
already
the
future
buddha
his
future
is
already
all
there
you
have
to
worship
in
him
in
you
in
everyone
the
buddha
which
is
coming
into
being
the
possible
the
hidden
buddha
the
world
my
friend
govinda
is
not
imperfect
or
on
a
slow
path
towards
perfection
no
it
is
perfect
in
every
moment
all
sin
already
carries
the
divine
forgiveness
in
itself
all
small
children
already
have
the
old
person
in
themselves
all
infants
already
have
death
all
dying
people
the
eternal
life
it
is
not
possible
for
any
person
to
see
how
far
another
one
has
already
progressed
on
his
path
in
the
robber
and
the
buddha
is
waiting
in
the
brahman
the
robber
is
waiting
in
deep
meditation
there
is
the
possibility
to
put
time
out
of
existence
to
see
all
life
which
was
is
and
will
be
as
if
it
was
simultaneous
and
there
everything
is
good
everything
is
perfect
everything
is
brahman
therefore
i
see
whatever
exists
as
good
death
is
to
me
like
life
sin
like
holiness
wisdom
like
foolishness
everything
has
to
be
as
it
is
everything
only
requires
my
consent
only
my
willingness
my
loving
agreement
to
be
good
for
me
to
do
nothing
but
work
for
my
benefit
to
be
unable
to
ever
harm
me
i
have
experienced
on
my
body
and
on
my
soul
that
i
needed
sin
very
much
i
needed
lust
the
desire
for
possessions
vanity
and
needed
the
most
shameful
despair
in
order
to
learn
how
to
give
up
all
resistance
in
order
to
learn
how
to
love
the
world
in
order
to
stop
comparing
it
to
some
world
i
wished
i
imagined
some
kind
of
perfection
i
had
made
up
but
to
leave
it
as
it
is
and
to
love
it
and
to
enjoy
being
a
part
of
these
oh
govinda
are
some
of
the
thoughts
which
have
come
into
my
mind
siddhartha
bent
down
picked
up
a
stone
from
the
ground
and
weighed
it
in
his
hand
this
here
he
said
playing
with
it
is
a
stone
and
will
after
a
certain
time
perhaps
turn
into
soil
and
will
turn
from
soil
into
a
plant
or
animal
or
human
being
in
the
past
i
would
have
said
this
stone
is
just
a
stone
it
is
worthless
it
belongs
to
the
world
of
the
maja
but
because
it
might
be
able
to
become
also
a
human
being
and
a
spirit
in
the
cycle
of
transformations
therefore
i
also
grant
it
importance
thus
i
would
perhaps
have
thought
in
the
past
but
today
i
think
this
stone
is
a
stone
it
is
also
animal
it
is
also
god
it
is
also
buddha
i
do
not
venerate
and
love
it
because
it
could
turn
into
this
or
that
but
rather
because
it
is
already
and
always
everything
and
it
is
this
very
fact
that
it
is
a
stone
that
it
appears
to
me
now
and
today
as
a
stone
this
is
why
i
love
it
and
see
worth
and
purpose
in
each
of
its
veins
and
cavities
in
the
yellow
in
the
gray
in
the
hardness
in
the
sound
it
makes
when
i
knock
at
it
in
the
dryness
or
wetness
of
its
surface
there
are
stones
which
feel
like
oil
or
soap
and
others
like
leaves
others
like
sand
and
every
one
is
special
and
prays
the
om
in
its
own
way
each
one
is
brahman
but
simultaneously
and
just
as
much
it
is
a
stone
is
oily
or
juicy
and
this
is
this
very
fact
which
i
like
and
regard
as
wonderful
and
worthy
of
but
let
me
speak
no
more
of
this
the
words
are
not
good
for
the
secret
meaning
everything
always
becomes
a
bit
different
as
soon
as
it
is
put
into
words
gets
distorted
a
bit
a
bit
silly
yes
and
this
is
also
very
good
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
also
very
much
agree
with
this
that
this
what
is
one
man
treasure
and
wisdom
always
sounds
like
foolishness
to
another
person
govinda
listened
silently
why
have
you
told
me
this
about
the
stone
he
asked
hesitantly
after
a
pause
i
did
it
without
any
specific
intention
or
perhaps
what
i
meant
was
that
love
this
very
stone
and
the
river
and
all
these
things
we
are
looking
at
and
from
which
we
can
learn
i
can
love
a
stone
govinda
and
also
a
tree
or
a
piece
of
bark
this
are
things
and
things
can
be
loved
but
i
can
not
love
words
therefore
teachings
are
no
good
for
me
they
have
no
hardness
no
softness
no
colours
no
edges
no
smell
no
taste
they
have
nothing
but
words
perhaps
it
are
these
which
keep
you
from
finding
peace
perhaps
it
are
the
many
words
because
salvation
and
virtue
as
well
sansara
and
nirvana
as
well
are
mere
words
govinda
there
is
no
thing
which
would
be
nirvana
there
is
just
the
word
nirvana
quoth
govinda
not
just
a
word
my
friend
is
nirvana
it
is
a
thought
siddhartha
continued
a
thought
it
might
be
so
i
must
confess
to
you
my
dear
i
do
differentiate
much
between
thoughts
and
words
to
be
honest
i
also
have
no
high
opinion
of
thoughts
i
have
a
better
opinion
of
things
here
on
this
for
instance
a
man
has
been
my
predecessor
and
teacher
a
holy
man
who
has
for
many
years
simply
believed
in
the
river
nothing
else
he
had
noticed
that
the
river
spoke
to
him
he
learned
from
it
it
educated
and
taught
him
the
river
seemed
to
be
a
god
to
him
for
many
years
he
did
not
know
that
every
wind
every
cloud
every
bird
every
beetle
was
just
as
divine
and
knows
just
as
much
and
can
teach
just
as
much
as
the
worshipped
river
but
when
this
holy
man
went
into
the
forests
he
knew
everything
knew
more
than
you
and
me
without
teachers
without
books
only
because
he
had
believed
in
the
river
govinda
said
but
is
that
what
you
call
actually
something
real
something
which
has
existence
is
it
just
a
deception
of
the
maja
just
an
image
and
illusion
your
stone
your
tree
your
river
are
they
actually
a
reality
this
too
spoke
siddhartha
i
do
not
care
very
much
about
let
the
things
be
illusions
or
not
after
all
i
would
then
also
be
an
illusion
and
thus
they
are
always
like
me
this
is
what
makes
them
so
dear
and
worthy
of
veneration
for
me
they
are
like
me
therefore
i
can
love
them
and
this
is
now
a
teaching
you
will
laugh
about
love
oh
govinda
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
important
thing
of
all
to
thoroughly
understand
the
world
to
explain
it
to
despise
it
may
be
the
thing
great
thinkers
do
but
i
only
interested
in
being
able
to
love
the
world
not
to
despise
it
not
to
hate
it
and
me
to
be
able
to
look
upon
it
and
me
and
all
beings
with
love
and
admiration
and
great
respect
this
i
understand
spoke
govinda
but
this
very
thing
was
discovered
by
the
exalted
one
to
be
a
deception
he
commands
benevolence
clemency
sympathy
tolerance
but
not
love
he
forbade
us
to
tie
our
heart
in
love
to
earthly
things
i
know
it
said
siddhartha
his
smile
shone
golden
i
know
it
govinda
and
behold
with
this
we
are
right
in
the
middle
of
the
thicket
of
opinions
in
the
dispute
about
words
for
i
can
not
deny
my
words
of
love
are
in
a
contradiction
a
seeming
contradiction
with
gotama
words
for
this
very
reason
i
distrust
in
words
so
much
for
i
know
this
contradiction
is
a
deception
i
know
that
i
am
in
agreement
with
gotama
how
should
he
not
know
love
he
who
has
discovered
all
elements
of
human
existence
in
their
transitoriness
in
their
meaninglessness
and
yet
loved
people
thus
much
to
use
a
long
laborious
life
only
to
help
them
to
teach
them
even
with
him
even
with
your
great
teacher
i
prefer
the
thing
over
the
words
place
more
importance
on
his
acts
and
life
than
on
his
speeches
more
on
the
gestures
of
his
hand
than
his
opinions
not
in
his
speech
not
in
his
thoughts
i
see
his
greatness
only
in
his
actions
in
his
life
for
a
long
time
the
two
old
men
said
nothing
then
spoke
govinda
while
bowing
for
a
farewell
i
thank
you
siddhartha
for
telling
me
some
of
your
thoughts
they
are
partially
strange
thoughts
not
all
have
been
instantly
understandable
to
me
this
being
as
it
may
i
thank
you
and
i
wish
you
to
have
calm
days
but
secretly
he
thought
to
himself
this
siddhartha
is
a
bizarre
person
he
expresses
bizarre
thoughts
his
teachings
sound
foolish
so
differently
sound
the
exalted
one
pure
teachings
clearer
purer
more
comprehensible
nothing
strange
foolish
or
silly
is
contained
in
them
but
different
from
his
thoughts
seemed
to
me
siddhartha
hands
and
feet
his
eyes
his
forehead
his
breath
his
smile
his
greeting
his
walk
never
again
after
our
exalted
gotama
has
become
one
with
the
nirvana
never
since
then
have
i
met
a
person
of
whom
i
felt
this
is
a
holy
man
only
him
this
siddhartha
i
have
found
to
be
like
this
may
his
teachings
be
strange
may
his
words
sound
foolish
out
of
his
gaze
and
his
hand
his
skin
and
his
hair
out
of
every
part
of
him
shines
a
purity
shines
a
calmness
shines
a
cheerfulness
and
mildness
and
holiness
which
i
have
seen
in
no
other
person
since
the
final
death
of
our
exalted
teacher
as
govinda
thought
like
this
and
there
was
a
conflict
in
his
heart
he
once
again
bowed
to
siddhartha
drawn
by
love
deeply
he
bowed
to
him
who
was
calmly
sitting
siddhartha
he
spoke
we
have
become
old
men
it
is
unlikely
for
one
of
us
to
see
the
other
again
in
this
incarnation
i
see
beloved
that
you
have
found
peace
i
confess
that
i
have
found
it
tell
me
oh
honourable
one
one
more
word
give
me
something
on
my
way
which
i
can
grasp
which
i
can
understand
give
me
something
to
be
with
me
on
my
path
it
is
often
hard
my
path
often
dark
siddhartha
siddhartha
said
nothing
and
looked
at
him
with
the
ever
unchanged
quiet
smile
govinda
stared
at
his
face
with
fear
with
yearning
suffering
and
the
eternal
search
was
visible
in
his
look
eternal
siddhartha
saw
it
and
smiled
bend
down
to
me
he
whispered
quietly
in
govinda
ear
bend
down
to
me
like
this
even
closer
very
close
kiss
my
forehead
govinda
but
while
govinda
with
astonishment
and
yet
drawn
by
great
love
and
expectation
obeyed
his
words
bent
down
closely
to
him
and
touched
his
forehead
with
his
lips
something
miraculous
happened
to
him
while
his
thoughts
were
still
dwelling
on
siddhartha
wondrous
words
while
he
was
still
struggling
in
vain
and
with
reluctance
to
think
away
time
to
imagine
nirvana
and
sansara
as
one
while
even
a
certain
contempt
for
the
words
of
his
friend
was
fighting
in
him
against
an
immense
love
and
veneration
this
happened
to
him
he
no
longer
saw
the
face
of
his
friend
siddhartha
instead
he
saw
other
faces
many
a
long
sequence
a
flowing
river
of
faces
of
hundreds
of
thousands
which
all
came
and
disappeared
and
yet
all
seemed
to
be
there
simultaneously
which
all
constantly
changed
and
renewed
themselves
and
which
were
still
all
siddhartha
he
saw
the
face
of
a
fish
a
carp
with
an
infinitely
painfully
opened
mouth
the
face
of
a
dying
fish
with
fading
eyes
he
saw
the
face
of
a
child
red
and
full
of
wrinkles
distorted
from
crying
he
saw
the
face
of
a
murderer
he
saw
him
plunging
a
knife
into
the
body
of
another
person
he
saw
in
the
same
second
this
criminal
in
bondage
kneeling
and
his
head
being
chopped
off
by
the
executioner
with
one
blow
of
his
sword
he
saw
the
bodies
of
men
and
women
naked
in
positions
and
cramps
of
frenzied
love
he
saw
corpses
stretched
out
motionless
cold
void
he
saw
the
heads
of
animals
of
boars
of
crocodiles
of
elephants
of
bulls
of
birds
he
saw
gods
saw
krishna
saw
agni
he
saw
all
of
these
figures
and
faces
in
a
thousand
relationships
with
one
another
each
one
helping
the
other
loving
it
hating
it
destroying
it
giving
to
it
each
one
was
a
will
to
die
a
passionately
painful
confession
of
transitoriness
and
yet
none
of
them
died
each
one
only
transformed
was
always
received
evermore
a
new
face
without
any
time
having
passed
between
the
one
and
the
other
face
and
all
of
these
figures
and
faces
rested
flowed
generated
themselves
floated
along
and
merged
with
each
other
and
they
were
all
constantly
covered
by
something
thin
without
individuality
of
its
own
but
yet
existing
like
a
thin
glass
or
ice
like
a
transparent
skin
a
shell
or
mold
or
mask
of
water
and
this
mask
was
smiling
and
this
mask
was
siddhartha
smiling
face
which
he
govinda
in
this
very
same
moment
touched
with
his
lips
and
govinda
saw
it
like
this
this
smile
of
the
mask
this
smile
of
oneness
above
the
flowing
forms
this
smile
of
simultaneousness
above
the
thousand
births
and
deaths
this
smile
of
siddhartha
was
precisely
the
same
was
precisely
of
the
same
kind
as
the
quiet
delicate
impenetrable
perhaps
benevolent
perhaps
mocking
wise
smile
of
gotama
the
buddha
as
he
had
seen
it
himself
with
great
respect
a
hundred
times
like
this
govinda
knew
the
perfected
ones
are
smiling
not
knowing
any
more
whether
time
existed
whether
the
vision
had
lasted
a
second
or
a
hundred
years
not
knowing
any
more
whether
there
existed
a
siddhartha
a
gotama
a
me
and
a
you
feeling
in
his
innermost
self
as
if
he
had
been
wounded
by
a
divine
arrow
the
injury
of
which
tasted
sweet
being
enchanted
and
dissolved
in
his
innermost
self
govinda
still
stood
for
a
little
while
bent
over
siddhartha
quiet
face
which
he
had
just
kissed
which
had
just
been
the
scene
of
all
manifestations
all
transformations
all
existence
the
face
was
unchanged
after
under
its
surface
the
depth
of
the
thousandfoldness
had
closed
up
again
he
smiled
silently
smiled
quietly
and
softly
perhaps
very
benevolently
perhaps
very
mockingly
precisely
as
he
used
to
smile
the
exalted
one
deeply
govinda
bowed
tears
he
knew
nothing
of
ran
down
his
old
face
like
a
fire
burnt
the
feeling
of
the
most
intimate
love
the
humblest
veneration
in
his
heart
deeply
he
bowed
touching
the
ground
before
him
who
was
sitting
motionlessly
whose
smile
reminded
him
of
everything
he
had
ever
loved
in
his
life
what
had
ever
been
valuable
and
holy
to
him
in
his
life
