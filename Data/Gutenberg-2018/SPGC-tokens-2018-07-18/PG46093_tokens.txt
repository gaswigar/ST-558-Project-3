preface
if
french
is
as
we
have
been
told
the
natural
language
of
the
art
of
fencing
it
seems
a
particularly
rash
venture
to
translate
a
french
book
on
the
subject
into
english
this
is
especially
the
case
when
the
original
is
such
a
work
as
secrets
de
which
so
far
from
being
a
dry
technical
manual
that
might
be
sufficiently
rendered
by
a
baldly
literal
version
is
one
of
those
fascinating
chatty
books
written
in
a
happy
vein
in
which
the
manner
of
writing
is
the
matter
of
principal
importance
but
the
delightful
ease
and
artful
simplicity
of
style
that
captivate
the
reader
are
the
translator
despair
i
have
made
the
attempt
for
my
own
amusement
and
i
am
publishing
my
translation
because
the
original
work
which
was
first
published
in
and
reprinted
in
has
been
for
some
years
inaccessible
and
because
i
think
it
is
a
book
that
will
interest
english
fencers
an
interesting
and
appreciative
account
of
the
book
is
given
in
the
introduction
to
the
volume
devoted
to
fencing
in
the
badminton
library
together
with
some
criticism
of
the
author
the
fencer
is
cautioned
that
the
baron
de
bazancourt
is
very
expert
literary
dodger
whose
specious
arguments
must
be
studied
with
the
greatest
caution
the
warning
note
is
no
doubt
wise
in
a
book
intended
for
the
english
fencer
for
english
fencing
certainly
shows
no
tendency
to
be
excessively
correct
but
is
rather
inclined
to
err
in
the
other
direction
but
no
fencer
who
reads
the
work
attentively
can
fail
to
derive
from
it
a
real
profit
and
i
hope
a
real
pleasure
the
keynote
of
the
book
is
that
a
fencer
must
fence
with
his
bazancourt
generally
calls
it
or
but
call
it
what
you
will
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
continual
tax
that
fencing
makes
on
the
resourcefulness
of
the
player
gives
it
its
subtle
and
enduring
charm
the
unforeseen
emergencies
that
have
to
be
faced
and
the
varieties
of
play
that
are
encountered
in
meeting
different
opponents
make
fencing
of
all
sports
the
least
mechanical
and
the
least
monotonous
we
are
often
told
that
fencing
will
never
be
popular
in
england
because
it
is
no
longer
required
for
practical
purposes
but
does
anyone
suppose
that
we
are
guided
by
practical
considerations
in
choosing
our
sports
fencing
is
a
most
exhilarating
exercise
and
one
that
is
particularly
suitable
for
those
of
us
who
live
a
town
life
a
dull
day
in
london
may
be
very
sensibly
enlivened
by
a
brisk
assault
the
luxury
of
getting
into
flannels
is
increased
by
the
reflection
that
for
an
hour
at
any
rate
one
will
think
of
nothing
but
the
foils
for
no
exercise
is
so
absorbing
as
fencing
whether
you
are
taking
a
lesson
or
are
engaged
in
a
friendly
combat
your
whole
attention
can
not
fail
to
be
occupied
there
is
room
for
nothing
else
and
on
that
account
alone
fencing
must
be
commended
as
a
mental
relaxation
of
the
highest
value
compared
with
boxing
fencing
has
the
advantage
that
it
can
be
continued
even
into
old
age
now
however
willing
one
may
be
to
be
punched
and
pommelled
there
usually
comes
a
time
when
it
is
inconvenient
to
appear
in
public
with
a
black
eye
or
a
bruised
cheek
few
men
who
take
to
fencing
and
master
the
preliminary
stages
can
make
up
their
minds
to
give
it
up
until
they
are
obliged
to
do
so
for
want
of
time
or
opportunity
the
cosmopolitan
character
of
fencing
is
another
point
in
its
favour
not
only
throughout
france
and
italy
but
wherever
french
or
italian
is
spoken
fencing
rooms
abound
and
the
stranger
who
visits
them
is
sure
to
be
received
with
friendly
interest
and
hospitality
fencers
are
always
glad
to
try
conclusions
with
a
new
blade
and
a
very
moderate
knowledge
of
the
art
may
often
serve
as
a
pleasant
and
informal
introduction
in
a
strange
country
the
art
of
translation
is
perhaps
as
slippery
and
elusive
as
the
art
of
fence
vit
de
loyales
says
the
baron
de
bazancourt
he
might
have
said
the
same
thing
of
translation
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
a
faithful
rendering
of
this
book
it
has
equally
been
my
object
to
make
my
version
readable
i
am
conscious
of
many
defects
and
can
not
hope
to
have
avoided
mistakes
but
if
i
have
sometimes
been
perfidious
i
trust
that
i
have
never
been
disloyal
i
have
to
thank
many
friends
for
assistance
and
advice
and
i
am
especially
indebted
to
mr
townsend
for
the
spirited
series
of
fencing
drawings
that
accompany
the
text

i
why
have
i
written
this
book
i
will
tell
you
for
of
all
the
subjects
that
might
have
occurred
to
me
this
i
am
sure
is
the
last
in
the
world
on
which
i
should
have
ever
dreamed
of
trespassing
accident
however
is
apt
to
take
a
hand
in
the
most
trivial
things
of
this
world
as
well
as
in
the
most
important
it
is
continually
responsible
for
the
most
unlikely
events
and
it
was
in
fact
by
accident
that
i
undertook
this
work
in
which
i
have
collected
and
jotted
down
remarks
that
are
entirely
my
own
concerning
an
art
to
which
i
have
devoted
myself
for
more
years
than
i
care
to
remember
i
was
staying
in
the
country
at
an
old
manor
house
belonging
to
one
of
my
friends
the
litter
of
autumn
fallen
leaves
and
withering
herbage
was
scattered
over
field
and
woodland
this
is
a
favourite
season
with
poets
when
nature
before
her
winter
sleep
affects
a
serene
and
melancholy
air
that
inclines
to
reverie
and
lends
wings
to
fancy
the
season
also
favours
sportsmen
coverts
in
which
the
game
has
hitherto
found
shelter
are
no
longer
impenetrable
and
every
day
the
wind
robs
the
poor
persecuted
beasts
of
some
fraction
of
their
shield
of
verdure
at
my
friend
house
there
were
no
poets
but
there
was
instead
a
large
shooting
party
we
used
to
take
the
field
after
breakfast
and
come
home
towards
dusk
all
of
us
as
tired
as
a
man
has
a
right
to
be
when
he
has
done
six
or
eight
hours
walking
after
dinner
we
invariably
adjourned
to
the
smoking
room
and
spent
the
evening
in
discussing
things
in
general
over
our
cigars
ii
one
evening
i
quite
forget
how
it
came
about
we
found
ourselves
talking
about
fencing
some
one
casual
remark
as
erratic
as
the
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
that
floated
vaguely
towards
the
ceiling
was
taken
up
by
some
one
else
and
led
to
other
remarks
which
gradually
became
more
definite
and
finally
solidified
into
a
conversation
one
can
always
talk
and
one
enjoys
talking
about
a
subject
in
which
one
is
interested
that
is
one
of
the
general
truths
and
as
i
have
always
been
devoted
to
the
practice
of
arms
i
found
myself
talking
at
some
length
and
expounding
some
views
of
my
own
which
i
have
tested
by
practical
experience
and
observation
till
they
have
established
themselves
in
my
mind
as
axioms
i
was
listened
to
with
attention
though
there
were
few
fencers
present
and
after
all
the
art
of
fence
does
furnish
a
most
interesting
fund
of
conversation
the
art
of
skilful
fighting
at
close
quarters
which
implies
a
knowledge
of
theory
combined
with
a
trained
power
of
execution
which
taxes
eye
and
hand
vigour
and
judgment
and
brings
into
play
every
faculty
of
mind
and
body
each
doing
its
part
and
each
in
turn
supplementing
and
reinforcing
the
other
iii
are
you
aware
said
one
of
my
friends
that
these
are
the
secrets
of
the
sword
that
you
are
revealing
to
us
only
i
replied
those
secrets
which
i
happen
to
know
but
really
you
have
hit
upon
the
right
word
for
the
secrets
of
the
sword
are
innumerable
it
is
a
proteus
in
the
hand
that
orders
it
and
obeys
the
least
motion
of
the
will
with
the
quick
docility
of
an
attendant
spirit
it
can
be
the
insolent
and
overbearing
bully
it
can
be
the
wary
and
diplomatic
courtier
at
one
moment
it
is
all
menace
a
keen
attacking
point
the
next
it
changes
to
a
protecting
shield
but
alas
for
our
poor
faithful
servant
the
sword
and
its
secrets
are
almost
forgotten
or
at
least
but
little
valued
there
was
a
time
and
a
time
not
so
very
remote
when
a
knowledge
of
was
considered
one
of
the
credentials
of
a
gentleman
apply
that
test
now
apply
it
to
yourselves
we
have
here
in
this
room
a
large
number
of
gentlemen
met
together
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
each
one
of
you
could
make
good
his
title
to
gentle
birth
and
that
in
more
ways
than
one
and
yet
how
many
of
you
would
be
seriously
embarrassed
if
you
were
required
to
manipulate
a
sword
how
many
of
you
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
would
make
but
a
very
pitiful
exhibition
of
yourselves
i
saw
by
the
smile
that
went
round
the
room
that
my
remarks
were
only
too
well
founded
of
course
i
continued
i
know
the
usual
answer
you
will
say
may
be
duffers
but
we
are
not
afraid
of
fighting
yes
you
are
not
afraid
of
fighting
that
is
to
say
you
are
willing
to
be
killed
by
the
first
bully
who
chooses
to
force
a
quarrel
upon
you
brave
words
truly
but
after
all
is
it
worth
while
to
be
the
owner
of
so
many
talents
youth
and
strength
a
cultured
mind
a
healthy
body
and
yet
not
even
to
know
how
to
defend
your
life
i
am
reminded
of
the
story
told
of
a
certain
general
when
one
of
his
officers
who
disagreed
with
him
on
the
policy
of
some
strategic
movement
had
said
general
when
the
time
comes
i
will
show
you
that
i
know
how
to
die
be
a
fool
sir
replied
the
general
duty
is
not
to
see
that
you
get
killed
but
to
take
care
that
you
do
surely
suggested
one
of
my
friends
the
real
difficulty
is
that
it
takes
years
of
conscientious
and
continual
application
to
make
even
a
moderate
fencer
quite
a
mistake
i
assure
you
why
only
the
other
day
i
happened
to
pick
up
one
or
two
books
about
fencing
and
glanced
through
them
i
assure
you
they
really
are
appalling
there
we
have
it
i
exclaimed
and
with
that
word
you
go
over
bag
and
baggage
to
the
enemy
camp
you
are
not
the
first
to
be
appalled
merely
because
the
professors
have
omitted
to
caution
the
reader
that
they
can
not
in
the
exercise
of
their
craft
afford
to
be
otherwise
than
omniscient
and
that
their
omniscience
must
be
aired
it
is
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
taxed
with
ignorance
or
of
being
rated
as
less
men
than
their
predecessors
that
they
insist
on
science
at
any
price
science
they
must
have
interminable
and
unmitigated
science
and
so
they
produce
their
laborious
treatises
monuments
of
erudition
but
as
you
say
appalling
for
my
part
after
reading
and
rereading
with
the
most
scrupulous
attention
everything
that
has
been
written
on
the
subject
i
remain
convinced
of
this
that
if
i
were
writing
a
manual
of
fencing
my
first
object
would
be
to
get
rid
of
the
alarming
jargon
of
technical
terms
which
are
supposed
to
be
indispensable
a
formidable
array
quite
enough
i
freely
admit
to
give
pause
to
the
most
resolute
and
to
blanch
the
cheek
of
the
keenest
aspirant
ah
you
are
quite
right
said
my
host
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
made
the
experiment
how
much
the
art
and
the
professors
too
would
have
gained
if
they
had
only
studied
simplicity
and
taken
the
trouble
to
make
themselves
intelligible
iv
the
conversation
you
see
was
getting
on
unfortunately
i
continued
most
of
the
professors
who
have
committed
themselves
to
paper
have
thought
otherwise
they
plunge
into
interminable
dissertations
on
the
denomination
of
thrusts
they
use
words
which
it
is
true
may
be
found
in
the
dictionary
but
which
have
an
unfamiliar
appearance
for
instance
they
talk
about
the
hand
or
instead
of
simply
saying
the
hand
with
the
nails
turned
up
or
the
hand
with
the
nails
turned
down
others
have
devoted
their
energy
to
working
out
combinations
and
classifications
of
feints
parries
and
ripostes
distinguishing
between
them
by
the
nicest
shades
of
difference
and
to
devising
subtleties
of
terminology
even
going
so
far
as
to
compile
and
exhibit
with
the
pride
of
a
collector
a
prodigious
catalogue
of
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
strokes
what
memory
could
possibly
contain
them
now
i
on
the
contrary
should
have
spared
no
pains
to
prove
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
learn
the
practical
management
of
the
sword
without
a
superhuman
effort
and
that
is
worth
cultivating
as
a
delightful
exercise
and
one
of
the
finest
kinds
of
sport
for
unfortunately
we
have
to
remember
that
latin
which
one
uses
so
seldom
perhaps
once
or
twice
after
leaving
college
and
greek
for
which
one
has
even
less
occasion
are
considered
useful
and
even
necessary
parts
of
polite
education
but
that
such
things
as
swimming
which
may
on
an
emergency
be
the
means
of
saving
your
life
or
fencing
which
is
one
of
the
most
healthy
of
athletic
exercises
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
developing
and
bracing
a
feeble
youngster
and
which
enables
you
to
defend
yourself
if
you
are
challenged
by
a
bully
or
assaulted
by
a
blackguard
are
reckoned
merely
frivolous
accomplishments
and
it
is
generally
recognised
of
course
that
it
is
not
right
to
waste
time
on
mere
accomplishments
i
mentioned
latin
and
greek
which
we
all
learnt
more
or
less
at
school
well
do
you
suppose
that
the
man
who
is
going
to
make
learning
his
profession
carries
his
studies
no
further
than
the
rest
of
us
however
scholarly
some
of
us
may
be
no
of
course
he
must
go
deeper
and
examine
the
remotest
bearings
of
the
particular
branch
of
knowledge
which
he
will
presently
have
to
teach
if
you
want
a
still
more
striking
analogy
take
horsemanship
most
men
learn
to
ride
and
can
as
a
matter
of
fact
manage
a
hack
in
the
park
without
making
an
exhibition
of
themselves
or
even
join
the
when
it
is
a
question
of
following
the
hounds
but
do
you
suppose
that
the
mere
man
on
horseback
takes
the
trouble
to
acquire
the
whole
art
of
horsemanship
the
severe
mastery
which
the
professional
requires
the
airs
of
the
school
rider
does
every
one
study
the
fundamental
principles
and
analyse
the
nice
distinctions
which
go
to
make
the
finished
equestrian
such
a
man
as
the
late
mr
astley
how
few
there
are
who
attain
or
pretend
to
attain
this
rare
degree
of
excellence
and
yet
they
alone
can
tell
you
how
much
perseverance
how
much
continual
application
and
downright
drudgery
they
have
had
to
go
through
for
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
perfect
mastery
of
any
kind
whatever
can
only
be
the
matured
result
of
extraordinary
diligence
yet
you
seldom
meet
a
man
who
can
not
ride
tolerably
and
you
find
that
men
ride
with
more
or
less
grace
or
freedom
or
vigour
according
to
their
natural
disposition
and
gradually
perfect
their
style
or
if
you
prefer
it
unconsciously
complete
their
education
by
the
growth
of
habit
and
experience
it
is
just
the
same
with
fencing
if
you
would
be
an
accomplished
swordsman
you
will
certainly
require
years
of
hard
work
close
application
and
incessant
practice
but
do
you
need
this
recondite
skill
what
would
you
do
with
it
you
would
find
it
embarrassing
all
that
you
need
as
men
of
leisure
is
to
be
able
to
use
a
sword
as
you
do
a
horse
for
your
amusement
and
when
you
have
occasion
for
it
and
observe
i
say
for
your
amusement
for
no
sport
is
so
attractive
for
its
own
sake
or
so
engrossing
as
the
practice
of
arms
you
are
of
opinion
then
remarked
the
comte
de
c
that
a
man
can
learn
to
use
a
sword
without
devoting
to
it
more
time
and
trouble
than
he
does
to
riding
i
am
sure
of
it
but
do
misunderstand
me
i
mean
riding
in
the
sense
of
sticking
on
in
fact
without
driving
the
analogy
too
hard
i
should
say
that
for
both
exercises
a
year
at
the
outside
is
all
that
is
required
to
obtain
useful
and
solid
results
and
i
should
add
that
after
a
few
months
trial
you
will
find
that
you
can
not
resist
the
fascination
that
belongs
unmistakably
to
both
these
sports
surely
that
is
not
too
much
to
ask
for
putting
you
into
good
trim
and
teaching
you
how
to
protect
yourself
then
why
do
they
say
so
some
one
remarked
well
i
do
say
so
i
replied
and
what
is
more
i
will
make
my
words
good
if
one
of
these
days
you
care
to
continue
this
discussion
i
was
unanimously
called
upon
to
keep
my
word
and
that
the
next
day
well
then
i
replied
i
shall
do
my
best
to
convince
you
but
you
do
give
me
much
law
what
with
hours
notice
there
something
in
that
i
will
sleep
upon
it
and
so
that
is
the
true
history
of
the
making
of
this
book
the
following
chapters
are
the
record
of
our
conversations
which
i
have
simply
put
into
shape
and
revised
illustration
the
first
evening
illustration
the
right
foot
i
the
next
day
after
dinner
we
all
reassembled
in
the
well
said
my
host
your
audience
you
see
is
complete
our
cigars
are
alight
and
we
are
ready
to
give
you
our
best
attention
of
course
i
replied
you
will
understand
that
i
have
no
intention
of
inflicting
upon
you
a
course
of
instruction
as
far
as
that
goes
the
books
especially
the
two
that
have
appeared
most
recently
by
professors
gomard
and
grisier
have
said
all
that
is
worth
saying
and
in
my
judgment
perhaps
a
great
deal
more
they
give
too
much
good
advice
too
many
excellent
rules
too
many
excellent
maxims
too
many
thrusts
feints
parries
ripostes
and
so
forth
i
am
very
far
from
holding
with
the
received
doctrine
of
the
necessity
or
the
importance
of
a
great
variety
of
play
i
believe
that
the
effectiveness
of
a
skilful
fencer
depends
on
the
correctness
of
his
inferences
on
the
alertness
and
nicety
of
his
judgment
on
quickness
of
hand
and
precision
of
movement
whether
in
attack
parry
or
riposte
rather
than
on
a
very
varied
play
which
necessitates
a
much
more
elaborate
training
and
so
far
from
being
of
any
real
use
serves
only
to
perplex
the
mind
the
alphabet
of
fencing
if
you
will
allow
the
expression
is
as
fixed
and
immutable
as
any
other
alphabet
its
characters
are
ascertained
and
definite
motions
which
are
combined
in
accordance
with
the
structure
and
balance
of
our
organism
the
natural
action
of
the
muscles
and
the
flexibility
possible
to
the
limbs
and
body
i
do
not
set
up
for
a
schoolmaster
and
shall
not
attempt
to
teach
you
this
alphabet
i
assume
that
you
are
already
acquainted
with
it
all
that
i
shall
do
or
at
all
events
try
to
do
is
to
discuss
the
theoretical
principles
for
apart
from
them
the
material
factors
are
only
so
much
dull
and
senseless
machinery
i
shall
try
to
keep
within
bounds
and
to
advance
a
few
simple
arguments
to
convince
you
that
swordsmanship
is
neither
so
slow
nor
so
perplexing
as
you
are
inclined
to
suppose
above
all
i
hope
you
will
not
allow
me
to
forget
that
this
is
a
conversation
remember
that
you
are
at
liberty
to
make
any
remarks
that
occur
to
you
that
is
part
of
the
bargain
several
of
my
friends
assured
me
that
i
need
have
no
anxiety
they
did
not
mean
to
let
me
off
too
easily
ii
to
begin
then
my
first
object
will
be
to
make
my
meaning
perfectly
plain
the
thing
to
do
will
be
to
take
fencing
in
its
broad
outlines
it
would
be
labour
thrown
away
to
enter
the
bewildering
labyrinth
of
those
interminable
details
which
after
all
are
nothing
more
than
the
mathematical
extension
of
elementary
principles
which
may
be
continued
to
infinity
fencing
in
its
infancy
had
to
feel
its
way
its
methods
were
yet
to
be
found
its
possibilities
to
be
explored
little
by
little
as
one
period
succeeded
another
and
the
art
became
in
many
respects
perfected
changes
were
introduced
and
especially
changes
that
tended
to
greater
simplicity
old
theories
became
old
fashioned
and
were
thrown
aside
to
make
room
for
new
doctrines
fencing
in
fact
was
developed
like
most
other
things
but
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
early
methods
of
the
old
masters
both
in
italy
and
france
date
from
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
century
and
that
the
weapons
employed
in
those
days
differed
materially
from
ours
in
shape
weight
and
function
the
change
of
weapon
has
naturally
led
to
a
change
of
method
it
would
doubtless
be
interesting
to
the
antiquary
to
trace
the
successive
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
and
to
compare
it
as
it
exists
with
what
it
was
in
when
marozzo
wrote
his
treatise
on
the
sword
pray
excuse
my
erudition
the
sword
of
that
period
was
a
wide
straight
blade
with
two
cutting
edges
i
need
not
say
that
marozzo
was
italian
the
first
french
work
on
the
subject
was
i
believe
a
treatise
by
henri
de
which
was
published
in
and
dedicated
to
charles
ix
at
that
time
france
was
a
long
way
behind
italy
where
for
twenty
years
already
the
edge
had
been
abandoned
for
the
point
it
is
not
my
intention
to
retrace
the
abstruse
history
of
the
development
of
swordsmanship
such
an
inquiry
would
however
prove
that
in
all
ages
the
new
truths
were
invariably
denied
before
they
established
themselves
as
accomplished
facts
there
is
no
need
then
as
you
will
doubtless
be
relieved
to
hear
to
discuss
the
systems
of
antiquity
we
will
pass
over
the
intervening
periods
without
further
preface
and
come
down
at
once
to
modern
times
iii
we
are
told
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
between
two
schools
probably
for
the
convenience
of
putting
ourselves
in
the
right
and
our
opponents
in
the
wrong
for
my
own
part
and
speaking
seriously
i
fail
to
recognise
more
than
one
true
that
one
may
be
regarded
from
several
points
of
view
i
can
distinguish
three
very
clearly
but
these
different
aspects
are
very
far
from
being
distinct
in
the
sense
of
clearly
defined
natural
orders
i
will
describe
three
kinds
of
play
which
are
adopted
by
fencers
according
to
fancy
the
first
is
fencing
regarded
as
a
graceful
athletic
exercise
contrived
very
much
on
the
lines
of
a
ceremonious
dance
the
interlacing
movements
of
the
combatants
as
they
close
and
fall
back
to
their
original
positions
recalling
the
figures
of
a
quadrille
one
might
almost
say
that
the
simplest
example
of
this
method
is
the
single
combat
of
melodrama
the
stage
duel
with
its
concerted
movements
and
that
it
finds
its
most
perfect
expression
or
if
you
prefer
the
phrase
attains
its
object
in
the
execution
of
a
series
of
and
or
dodgy
a
complicated
succession
of
attacks
parries
and
ripostes
skilfully
delivered
and
brought
off
strictly
in
accordance
with
prescribed
regulations
the
second
is
fencing
conceived
as
an
exact
science
here
it
is
noble
art
that
calls
for
profound
study
and
arduous
research
the
student
must
explore
its
truths
and
consider
them
in
all
their
bearings
pursue
theory
to
its
remotest
ramifications
and
drag
to
light
its
most
reluctant
secrets
solid
hard
work
and
assiduous
application
such
as
science
always
demands
of
her
votaries
backed
by
physical
and
intellectual
resources
naturally
fitted
to
the
task
are
the
only
means
which
will
enable
you
to
achieve
this
consummate
skill
the
highest
degree
of
attainment
in
the
art
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
say
that
the
annals
of
the
sword
record
but
few
names
of
undisputed
preeminence
new
stars
that
mark
the
epochs
in
its
history
the
third
is
fencing
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
practical
in
this
case
the
method
is
fashioned
so
to
speak
by
personal
inspiration
and
is
impressed
with
the
stamp
of
individual
character
this
is
the
real
thing
battle
in
deadly
earnest
complete
with
all
the
terrors
and
sudden
crises
of
warfare
instead
of
passes
ingeniously
complicated
and
foiled
by
parries
as
scientifically
elaborate
steel
clashes
with
steel
intent
on
forcing
somewhere
a
passage
for
the
point
the
game
becomes
a
fight
and
a
fight
all
the
more
grim
because
the
fighting
animal
is
reinforced
by
science
and
chooses
from
her
armoury
the
weapons
that
make
him
strong
rejecting
whatever
is
cumbrous
or
likely
to
obscure
his
hue
of
resolution
we
now
see
the
difference
between
the
two
styles
call
them
schools
if
you
like
one
wishes
to
preserve
intact
and
unalloyed
the
ancient
academical
traditions
i
had
almost
called
them
the
traditions
of
the
dancing
master
while
the
other
inclines
to
what
nowadays
we
call
realism
is
that
a
gain
or
a
loss
at
the
present
time
everything
tends
to
realism
but
we
are
not
so
far
as
i
know
obliged
to
admit
that
the
dream
is
the
type
of
perfect
beauty
and
the
real
the
type
of
all
that
is
ugly
and
bad
we
live
in
a
practical
age
perhaps
too
practical
sometimes
one
may
regret
that
it
is
so
but
what
other
result
could
you
expect
to
follow
from
the
convulsions
that
have
so
frequently
shattered
it
the
ideal
scared
by
the
noise
and
confusion
of
our
revolutions
so
often
repeated
so
seldom
foreseen
has
used
its
wings
to
some
purpose
and
taken
flight
to
a
world
far
removed
from
ours
iv
you
will
tell
me
that
my
comment
is
too
grave
for
my
text
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
small
things
and
great
are
linked
together
by
bonds
which
may
be
invisible
but
are
none
the
less
real
every
age
remarked
one
of
my
friends
has
its
own
manners
and
customs
we
no
longer
live
in
the
days
when
every
gentleman
carried
a
sword
at
his
side
and
as
a
matter
of
course
knew
how
to
use
it
the
taste
for
fencing
is
not
so
universal
that
we
are
all
impatient
to
be
initiated
into
its
inmost
mysteries
some
of
us
may
not
have
sufficient
leisure
or
sufficient
inclination
we
are
too
busy
or
too
lazy
i
believe
that
what
most
men
think
about
it
can
be
put
in
a
very
few
words
do
want
to
fight
if
we
must
we
should
like
to
be
able
to
show
our
teeth
and
fight
like
gentlemen
that
is
all
that
the
average
man
wants
with
fencing
quite
right
chimed
in
the
vicomte
de
with
a
laugh
we
only
want
just
so
much
of
it
as
will
serve
our
private
ends
all
that
you
say
i
continued
is
true
but
it
is
not
the
whole
truth
as
you
would
readily
admit
if
you
paid
a
visit
to
one
of
the
fencing
rooms
of
paris
if
you
happened
for
instance
to
drop
in
on
my
friend
and
esteemed
master
pons
you
would
find
a
gathering
of
amateurs
who
are
devoted
to
the
practice
of
arms
who
keep
up
the
traditions
with
taste
and
culture
and
understand
thoroughly
well
how
a
sword
ought
to
be
used
but
to
be
quite
fair
i
must
hasten
to
add
that
the
prowess
and
prestige
of
these
brilliant
players
would
not
suffer
by
the
simplification
of
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
a
treatise
on
fencing
for
the
use
of
gentlemen
who
have
so
little
time
to
spare
and
so
much
to
waste
is
a
book
to
be
written
a
book
of
real
utility
and
importance
and
indeed
almost
indispensable
i
have
put
my
finger
on
a
felt
want
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
briefly
explain
how
i
think
such
a
book
ought
to
be
written
and
what
it
ought
to
teach
i
know
of
course
that
i
shall
be
violently
contradicted
but
after
all
i
know
that
i
am
on
the
right
track
i
have
told
you
that
we
are
asked
to
make
an
absolute
distinction
between
two
schools
of
fencing
obviously
it
is
the
new
school
that
is
wrong
and
as
i
happen
to
belong
to
that
school
you
must
give
me
leave
to
defend
it
or
at
all
events
to
explain
its
tendencies
logically
theoretically
and
practically
take
care
sir
a
voice
was
heard
to
remark
those
three
words
are
decidedly
appalling
do
be
afraid
i
answered
they
are
not
so
formidable
as
they
seem
at
first
sight
you
will
find
that
if
we
thresh
out
the
general
principles
what
i
have
to
say
presently
will
be
much
simplified
and
easier
to
follow
you
often
hear
men
say
is
no
pretty
fencing
nowadays
it
has
relapsed
into
its
primitive
brutality
not
at
all
i
should
answer
it
has
come
back
to
its
proper
object
for
consider
an
exercise
an
art
which
starts
with
the
fundamental
idea
of
a
fight
between
two
men
who
are
thirsting
for
each
blood
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
mere
amusement
or
as
an
academical
study
in
civility
and
good
manners
one
might
argue
with
some
effect
that
to
sacrifice
the
first
essential
principle
of
the
art
to
superior
refinements
which
were
really
too
exclusive
was
a
risky
game
to
play
and
that
sooner
or
later
the
players
were
sure
to
discover
that
fact
to
their
cost
now
i
should
maintain
that
the
revolution
which
has
been
brought
about
is
a
clear
advance
and
only
brutal
if
you
will
have
it
so
because
it
is
the
assertion
of
the
brutal
truth
with
the
exception
of
the
few
who
have
the
ambition
to
make
themselves
accomplished
swordsmen
men
you
meet
in
the
fencing
room
do
not
as
a
rule
come
there
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
professor
and
imbibe
the
mystic
lore
of
scientific
theory
which
he
expounds
but
rather
to
be
drilled
and
disciplined
in
the
practical
use
of
the
sword
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
as
a
young
man
i
was
passionately
fond
of
fencing
i
worked
at
it
with
enthusiasm
my
diligence
and
devotion
were
untiring
among
my
contemporaries
were
several
very
strong
amateurs
really
skilful
swordsmen
experts
worthy
of
the
best
days
and
most
glorious
traditions
of
the
sword
i
am
thinking
of
such
men
as
ambert
caccia
choquet
lord
seymour
the
marquis
de
and
others
a
group
of
amateurs
well
able
to
hold
their
own
with
the
most
skilful
masters
i
believe
that
at
that
time
and
i
give
you
this
as
my
sincere
conviction
fencing
reached
as
high
a
level
as
at
any
period
in
its
history
vi
it
was
the
opening
of
a
new
era
hitherto
the
art
had
advanced
along
a
narrow
track
now
the
old
ways
suddenly
broadened
out
old
methods
were
superseded
fencing
was
no
longer
treated
as
an
academical
accomplishment
a
graceful
exercise
in
courtly
skill
and
bearing
from
which
originality
was
barred
it
had
become
something
more
than
the
glib
repetition
of
set
phrases
that
had
been
got
by
heart
from
a
book
and
carefully
rehearsed
the
new
movement
as
it
may
well
be
called
though
it
abandoned
the
perfect
manner
which
had
grown
too
perfect
brought
our
elusive
art
back
to
regions
less
celestial
i
readily
admit
but
at
the
same
time
brought
it
face
to
face
with
other
than
imaginary
difficulties
the
art
received
a
new
impetus
fighters
men
equipped
with
abundant
energy
and
assurance
who
were
convinced
that
all
that
was
necessary
for
was
a
general
athletic
training
such
as
they
possessed
called
the
fencer
skill
in
question
regarded
as
fencing
their
style
may
have
been
faulty
not
to
say
atrocious
but
they
confronted
the
fencer
with
this
logical
dilemma
are
a
master
of
the
sword
or
an
accomplished
amateur
i
on
the
other
hand
know
nothing
about
it
hit
me
and
do
not
let
me
hit
you
that
is
all
i
ask
i
shall
fight
by
the
light
of
nature
and
do
what
i
can
you
will
be
strictly
scientific
and
keep
to
your
rules
to
my
mind
the
only
way
to
silence
an
opponent
of
this
sort
was
to
take
sword
in
hand
and
literally
demonstrate
to
him
that
he
was
equally
ignorant
and
incapable
this
course
however
did
not
commend
itself
to
others
who
were
content
to
fight
this
modern
hydra
which
reappeared
every
day
in
some
new
shape
with
contempt
the
professors
gnashed
their
teeth
and
swore
though
a
few
of
them
kept
their
temper
our
art
then
they
declaimed
mere
delusion
a
fallen
idol
are
we
to
prostitute
and
expose
it
to
the
barbarous
excesses
of
a
brutal
and
ignorant
mob
are
we
to
join
in
an
outlandish
babel
where
every
one
claims
to
be
heard
in
his
own
tongue
some
jargon
which
no
one
can
understand
there
certainly
was
something
in
this
line
of
argument
however
magisterially
it
might
be
stated
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
impossible
to
deny
that
there
was
wrapped
up
in
these
ungainly
eccentricities
a
real
truth
which
could
not
be
entirely
neglected
for
among
the
noisy
crowd
who
would
have
liked
to
set
their
fads
upon
a
pinnacle
one
found
fencers
of
experience
men
who
by
long
training
and
the
use
of
scientific
method
had
acquired
sound
judgment
and
thorough
workmanship
these
men
it
is
true
had
the
courage
to
trample
on
the
ancient
superstitions
and
gladly
welcomed
the
widening
of
the
field
which
would
give
ample
room
and
scope
for
every
kind
of
bias
it
was
clearly
a
revolution
and
declared
itself
by
the
unmistakable
signs
of
all
revolutions
by
its
aggressive
attitude
and
by
its
onslaught
on
old
ideas
and
traditions
which
till
then
had
been
thought
unassailable
molière
famous
maxim
and
do
be
hit
back
asserted
itself
triumphantly
truth
and
falsehood
went
hand
in
hand
the
thing
to
be
done
was
to
winnow
the
chaff
from
the
corn
and
not
reject
the
whole
as
worthless
vii
well
let
us
now
see
if
we
can
sum
up
the
real
changes
which
the
new
school
introduced
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
proposed
absolutely
none
that
was
unreasonable
its
tenets
amounted
to
this
fencer
must
be
judged
not
so
much
by
his
graceful
attitude
and
classical
style
not
so
much
by
his
masterly
command
of
precise
execution
as
by
his
power
of
quickly
conceiving
and
quickly
delivering
the
right
attack
at
the
right
moment
once
a
beginner
has
learnt
the
rudiments
of
when
he
has
learnt
that
the
movements
of
hand
and
body
must
correspond
and
maintain
an
even
balance
in
every
position
that
the
wrist
must
be
quick
to
follow
the
adverse
blade
and
form
a
close
parry
without
flying
wild
and
wide
in
uncontrolled
disorder
when
he
can
appreciate
the
value
of
a
step
to
the
rear
and
the
value
of
a
step
to
the
front
when
he
has
grasped
the
danger
to
which
he
is
exposed
in
making
a
complicated
attack
and
realises
that
the
effectiveness
of
a
simple
attack
depends
on
the
power
of
seizing
the
critical
moment
then
he
should
be
left
to
follow
his
natural
instinct
and
allowed
to
exercise
his
own
judgment
in
making
use
of
the
knowledge
he
has
acquired
you
should
not
say
to
him
must
now
describe
an
exact
circle
beyond
which
by
thought
word
or
deed
you
must
not
budge
you
find
it
a
more
natural
position
and
easier
for
attack
and
riposte
to
lean
your
body
forward
and
double
yourself
up
it
can
not
be
helped
you
are
required
to
keep
the
body
upright
by
the
rules
of
classical
fencing
prefer
to
keep
out
of
distance
because
you
find
that
at
close
quarters
your
nervous
dread
of
a
surprise
attack
or
of
a
quick
thrust
is
disconcerting
and
disturbs
your
equanimity
you
must
not
keep
out
of
distance
you
are
required
to
keep
the
prescribed
distance
and
to
join
blades
are
afraid
of
attacks
on
the
sword
such
as
beats
binds
and
pressures
or
of
surprise
attacks
and
to
avoid
them
you
refuse
to
engage
your
adversary
blade
you
must
not
refuse
you
are
required
to
engage
swords
by
the
rules
of
the
game
only
bad
fencers
attempt
to
avoid
the
engagement
attack
in
the
low
lines
perhaps
you
hit
your
opponent
below
the
belt
quite
true
the
hit
would
be
fatal
in
a
duel
but
in
it
is
considered
a
foul
blow
the
code
does
not
allow
it
therefore
the
hit
is
bad
viii
this
sort
of
thing
is
mistaken
prejudice
the
assault
ought
to
be
a
sham
fight
it
follows
that
everyone
should
have
liberty
of
action
do
not
attempt
to
force
to
be
graceful
and
elegant
if
he
is
not
built
that
way
permit
to
develope
his
own
style
in
his
own
fashion
and
do
not
try
to
make
him
a
servile
copy
of
yourself
merely
for
the
sake
of
emphasising
your
superiority
if
he
makes
mistakes
take
advantage
of
them
that
is
the
most
convincing
kind
of
correction
if
his
play
is
dangerous
but
incorrect
show
him
that
you
can
be
at
once
correct
and
dangerous
in
short
we
ask
for
a
fair
field
and
no
favour
for
every
sort
of
style
and
theory
that
is
based
on
a
study
of
the
weapon
science
you
know
is
the
result
of
intelligent
application
do
you
seriously
believe
that
these
fencers
are
devoid
of
science
because
they
refuse
to
be
judged
by
your
standard
or
because
they
try
to
obtain
new
results
where
you
persist
in
seeing
nothing
but
annoying
tricks
you
must
allow
one
of
two
things
either
the
methods
which
these
fencers
employ
their
plans
of
attack
and
defence
are
based
on
policy
and
their
knowledge
of
the
weapon
and
their
source
of
inspiration
is
the
same
as
yours
in
that
case
they
are
justified
by
results
they
have
teeth
and
can
bite
and
are
not
the
easy
prey
which
you
expected
to
find
them
or
on
the
contrary
they
go
to
work
without
judgment
they
let
fly
at
random
and
advance
or
retire
without
any
notion
of
time
or
distance
their
parries
are
wide
and
weak
without
any
sense
of
touch
their
attacks
uncertain
wild
and
incoherent
in
that
case
they
are
not
dangerous
chance
may
perhaps
protect
them
once
but
you
with
your
experience
and
skill
of
course
will
easily
defeat
them
and
their
play
will
lead
them
promptly
into
every
trap
which
you
choose
to
set
for
them
ix
such
is
the
controversy
the
great
quarrel
between
the
two
schools
the
feud
between
the
white
rose
and
the
red
i
have
attempted
to
explain
it
to
you
in
its
general
outlines
as
clearly
as
i
possibly
could
you
will
find
it
easier
to
understand
the
details
which
we
shall
consider
when
we
continue
this
discussion
what
will
your
subject
be
asked
my
host
i
really
can
not
say
i
replied
it
would
be
difficult
to
lay
down
a
regular
plan
no
doubt
something
will
turn
up
to
talk
about
and
by
the
way
this
morning
i
noticed
in
the
library
one
or
two
old
books
about
and
i
shall
try
to
find
time
to
turn
them
over
illustration
the
second
evening
illustration
legs
are
i
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
that
my
undertaking
was
more
serious
than
i
had
anticipated
and
that
i
had
let
myself
in
for
some
uncommonly
hard
work
for
i
should
have
to
advance
solid
reasons
in
support
of
the
theories
that
i
had
so
rashly
propounded
i
had
committed
myself
to
nothing
less
than
the
exposition
of
a
system
to
men
who
for
the
most
part
knew
nothing
at
all
about
and
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
technical
terms
i
should
have
to
be
clear
and
precise
and
ready
to
answer
any
questions
that
might
be
put
to
me
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
carry
my
little
audience
with
me
because
i
venture
to
think
that
no
gentleman
education
is
complete
without
some
knowledge
of
fencing
and
i
consider
that
parents
and
guardians
are
much
to
blame
if
they
fail
to
recognise
the
importance
of
this
indispensable
exercise
which
not
only
strengthens
and
developes
the
learner
body
but
also
insures
his
life
ah
i
exclaimed
as
i
joined
the
company
in
the
where
we
met
every
evening
my
audience
i
see
is
before
me
you
have
kept
your
audience
waiting
said
my
host
and
we
have
kept
an
armchair
waiting
for
you
sit
down
and
begin
as
soon
as
you
please
thank
you
i
replied
sitting
down
i
will
begin
at
once
ii
i
remarked
yesterday
that
the
art
of
fencing
would
greatly
benefit
by
simplification
and
that
it
does
not
require
such
formidable
and
protracted
study
as
some
of
the
by
their
elaborate
display
of
intricate
and
interminable
combinations
would
lead
you
to
suppose
the
elementary
principles
of
are
four
in
number
they
are
these
simple
attacks
composite
attacks
simple
parries

my
classification
you
see
is
not
very
complicated
but
some
one
objected
you
are
surely
forgetting
to
name
an
immense
number
of
strokes
and
parries
for
it
is
impossible
that
the
long
lists
of
names
which
are
given
in
the
books
and
the
directions
for
the
various
passes
which
have
the
air
of
cabalistic
formulae
and
are
about
equally
intelligible
can
be
reduced
to
such
simple
terms
i
am
willing
to
forget
them
i
replied
in
fact
more
than
willing
for
i
am
convinced
that
they
only
serve
to
distract
the
learner
mind
the
simpler
the
principles
the
simpler
the
practice
give
him
fewer
things
to
do
and
he
will
do
them
more
easily
and
he
will
certainly
learn
to
do
them
in
a
shorter
time
i
have
always
said
that
a
of
fencing
which
contained
nothing
that
was
superfluous
would
not
fill
a
volume
but
might
be
written
out
on
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
besides
i
would
have
you
notice
that
several
of
the
attacks
parries
and
ripostes
included
in
my
list
might
logically
have
been
omitted
because
they
are
simply
different
ways
of
executing
the
same
movement
for
instance
what
i
have
called
is
the
combination
of
two
one
delivered
in
quarte
the
other
in
tierce
the
straight
is
the
combination
of
a
on
the
sword
with
a
the
is
simply
a
followed
by
a
are
in
like
manner
the
different
methods
which
are
most
commonly
used
of
executing
the
or
the
the
two
fundamental
strokes
of
even
the
is
really
a
sort
of
since
it
starts
from
the
same
position
is
aimed
at
the
same
point
and
may
be
met
by
the
same
parries
the
only
difference
is
that
the
passes
under
the
blade
while
the
passes
over
the
point
the
and
disengage
in
is
the
same
movement
as
conceived
and
executed
in
the
one
case
as
an
attack
in
the
other
as
a
parry
and
disengage
in
is
related
in
precisely
the
same
way
to
you
see
then
that
the
multiplication
of
strokes
far
from
extending
to
infinity
may
be
reduced
to
very
narrow
limits
and
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
if
you
transgress
these
limits
you
are
at
once
involved
in
endless
confusion
which
you
ought
to
be
very
careful
to
you
will
i
am
sure
admit
the
force
of
my
argument
the
attacks
and
parries
which
i
have
described
traverse
all
the
lines
which
are
open
to
the
passage
of
the
sword
that
is
to
say
high
and
low
lines
the
inside
lines
and
the
the
fencer
whose
mind
is
set
free
from
the
perplexity
of
parries
complete
and
parries
intermediate
and
so
forth
understands
more
clearly
the
materials
that
are
available
for
his
combinations
and
the
measures
that
he
must
take
to
meet
the
adverse
attack
the
lucidity
of
his
mind
is
reflected
even
in
the
movement
of
his
hand
which
goes
straight
to
its
mark
without
hesitation
or
confusion
speed
and
freedom
of
delivery
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
and
we
must
not
forget
that
quickness
of
hand
combined
with
what
may
be
called
fencing
judgment
is
of
all
qualifications
the
most
important
the
most
necessary
the
most
vitally
indispensable
iv
we
may
as
well
follow
up
the
turn
our
conversation
has
taken
and
pass
under
review
without
further
preface
the
three
of
swordsmanship
judgment
control
speed
the
man
who
should
master
these
three
would
be
the
pattern
of
the
perfect
fencer
well
what
of
fencing
judgment
why
in
the
world
should
you
be
afraid
of
it
as
though
it
were
the
hydra
that
guards
the
sacred
portals
what
is
it
but
that
part
of
the
understanding
that
we
all
bring
to
bear
on
the
conduct
of
everyday
life
nothing
in
human
affairs
however
trivial
or
however
great
can
be
done
without
it
fencing
judgment
implies
more
especially
distrust
cunning
a
wise
caution
the
power
of
interpreting
the
dumb
language
of
the
sword
the
faculty
of
drawing
correct
inferences
these
faculties
are
in
the
first
instance
directly
stimulated
by
the
master
lessons
and
natural
intelligence
acting
without
any
conscious
effort
on
your
part
combined
with
experience
will
make
the
good
seed
grow
do
not
concern
yourself
about
it
always
has
a
most
disturbing
effect
on
the
mind
the
other
night
when
i
spoke
of
the
alphabet
of
fencing
i
had
a
special
object
in
view
there
is
a
language
of
the
sword
by
which
questions
are
asked
and
answered
as
soon
as
you
have
learnt
the
words
you
can
speak
and
understand
it
to
admit
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
separate
study
of
every
possible
phrase
implies
that
a
simple
and
straightforward
method
of
instruction
which
i
hold
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
is
unattainable
in
like
manner
the
faculty
of
control
is
a
thing
that
may
be
gradually
acquired
by
practice
it
is
the
result
of
imparting
a
supple
to
the
wrist
and
body
and
consists
in
the
knitting
up
of
the
various
operations
into
one
continuous
movement
but
as
in
the
case
of
fencing
judgment
so
here
the
desired
result
can
not
be
obtained
all
at
once
it
is
the
first
and
most
natural
consequence
of
your
instructions
it
comes
of
daily
practice
and
you
must
patiently
watch
and
wait
for
it
as
you
might
wait
for
a
peach
slowly
ripening
on
a
sunny
wall
let
it
grow
upon
you
like
a
habit
by
slow
degrees
till
it
becomes
a
second
nature
speed
not
of
course
mere
quickness
of
hand
but
the
rapid
execution
of
every
movement
is
one
of
the
fencer
great
resources
whether
in
attack
parry
or
retreat
it
is
to
my
mind
the
main
point
to
be
insisted
on
from
the
very
first
and
accordingly
i
think
that
the
master
should
be
careful
not
to
overdo
the
sort
of
teaching
that
consists
in
delivering
a
running
commentary
such
as
this
now
not
too
fast
take
your
time
about
it
think
what
you
are
doing
keep
your
hand
in
order
mark
each
motion
at
the
word
and
so
forth
do
hurry
you
will
go
fast
enough
by
and
by
it
is
certainly
useful
to
practise
the
hand
by
exercising
it
on
the
master
jacket
but
it
is
useless
to
practise
it
by
slow
movements
first
explain
how
the
stroke
is
to
be
executed
and
then
without
more
ado
make
your
pupil
get
into
the
way
of
taking
it
quickly
slowness
is
convenient
because
it
renders
execution
easy
but
the
ease
of
execution
that
is
derived
from
it
is
dangerous
because
it
reacts
on
the
judgment
and
accustoms
the
mind
to
lazy
ways
your
object
is
no
doubt
to
bring
the
hand
under
control
and
analyse
the
stroke
in
detail
but
if
the
result
of
your
teaching
is
that
your
pupil
falls
into
a
sluggish
habit
you
are
sowing
the
seeds
of
a
vice
which
you
will
probably
never
succeed
in
extirpating
suppose
you
are
teaching
a
child
to
walk
you
are
not
surprised
that
his
first
steps
are
wavering
and
unsteady
and
that
he
can
not
plant
his
feeble
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
you
hold
him
up
but
you
let
him
walk
in
due
time
he
learns
to
use
his
strength
as
a
bird
learns
to
fly
the
young
fencer
is
the
child
learning
to
walk
as
his
knowledge
and
experience
gradually
expand
many
faults
will
disappear
of
themselves
or
will
be
more
easily
seen
and
corrected
by
his
maturer
judgment
speed
is
a
mechanical
force
unreasoning
unconscious
but
a
force
capable
of
development
you
must
add
fuel
to
the
fire
and
not
allow
it
to
go
out
do
you
suppose
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
change
the
word
of
command
do
quickly
what
you
have
done
slowly
hitherto
your
new
command
introduces
a
new
idea
and
creates
new
difficulties
such
speaking
generally
are
the
essential
principles
of
fencing
i
can
not
say
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
showing
you
clearly
how
simple
the
lesson
on
these
lines
may
be
made
or
how
far
i
have
been
able
to
reassure
those
who
have
inadvertently
opened
a
treatise
on
and
have
fought
shy
of
the
subject
ever
since
but
i
am
convinced
that
a
course
of
instruction
such
as
i
suggest
would
produce
very
good
results
to
explain
myself
more
fully
as
i
am
talking
among
friends
and
there
are
no
professors
present
i
will
go
on
to
tell
you
briefly
how
i
should
set
about
teaching
the
use
of
the
sword
vi
i
should
expect
my
scholar
during
the
first
month
to
give
up
an
hour
a
to
foil
practice
and
after
that
to
keep
it
up
times
a
my
first
lesson
would
be
devoted
to
showing
him
theoretically
and
practically
the
vital
importance
of
establishing
a
perfect
concert
or
balance
between
the
various
movements
this
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
all
athletic
exercises
and
applies
equally
to
riding
swimming
gymnastics
and
to
fencing
i
should
make
him
advance
and
retire
lunge
and
recover
taking
care
not
to
lose
his
balance
this
first
lesson
is
sufficient
to
enable
the
least
intelligent
to
understand
the
mechanism
of
the
different
movements
which
are
based
on
the
natural
and
instinctive
faculties
of
the
human
body
come
c
i
said
rising
from
my
chair
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
have
never
attempted
to
fence
will
you
allow
me
to
make
use
of
you
by
way
of
illustration
i
shall
be
delighted
replied
c
but
i
shall
be
very
awkward
perhaps
you
will
be
for
the
first
five
minutes
it
is
the
common
lot
from
which
no
one
can
escape
now
place
yourself
guard
the
words
explain
themselves
to
be
on
guard
to
protect
yourself
that
is
to
say
to
hold
yourself
equally
ready
for
attack
or
defence
bend
your
legs
let
me
use
an
expression
which
is
perhaps
incorrect
but
which
explains
my
meaning
clearly
sit
well
down
your
right
arm
must
be
half
extended
as
a
general
rule
the
wrist
should
be
at
the
height
of
the
breast
you
will
be
able
later
to
modify
these
elementary
studies
by
adapting
them
to
suit
the
position
which
comes
to
you
most
naturally
the
important
thing
is
to
acquire
an
uncramped
easy
style
and
to
keep
the
body
evenly
balanced
in
this
position
the
sword
can
most
easily
traverse
the
various
openings
that
are
offered
to
it
i
advance
on
you
in
order
to
get
back
and
always
keep
your
distance
you
have
only
to
carry
the
left
foot
to
the
rear
and
let
the
right
foot
follow
it
immediately
to
advance
on
me
simply
reverse
these
movements
bring
the
right
foot
forward
and
follow
it
up
with
the
left
bravo
you
advance
like
a
professor
see
that
you
keep
your
legs
bent
and
the
body
upright
so
as
to
be
always
ready
for
advance
or
retreat
if
you
can
not
avoid
stooping
lean
forward
rather
than
backward
by
carrying
the
body
forward
you
are
no
more
exposed
than
you
were
before
for
the
body
by
its
inclined
position
protects
itself
presents
a
smaller
surface
and
makes
it
more
difficult
for
your
opponent
to
fix
his
point
when
he
might
otherwise
hit
you
but
if
you
throw
the
body
back
you
lose
the
power
of
making
a
quick
attack
and
a
quick
riposte
are
you
tired
no
good
that
shows
that
your
position
is
correct
and
that
it
does
not
cramp
your
muscles
or
paralyse
any
of
your
movements
you
understand
of
course
that
by
standing
sideways
you
present
a
smaller
target
to
your
adversary
so
much
for
defence
now
for
the
attack
vii
in
order
to
attack
you
lunge
by
carrying
the
right
leg
smartly
forward
and
straightening
the
left
so
as
to
give
the
body
its
full
extension
whatever
the
attack
may
be
whether
simple
or
composite
the
movements
of
the
hand
must
be
completed
and
the
arm
absolutely
straight
before
the
lunge
is
made
though
the
different
movements
must
follow
each
other
without
the
least
interval
it
is
equally
important
to
remember
that
the
recovery
must
be
as
smart
as
the
attack
the
great
danger
of
the
attack
is
that
it
should
be
too
intemperate
for
a
too
intemperate
attack
leaves
you
exposed
to
danger
without
strength
or
speed
to
escape
but
some
one
asked
is
it
really
necessary
when
you
are
on
guard
to
arrange
the
left
arm
above
the
head
in
a
graceful
curve
and
then
swing
it
down
to
the
leg
as
you
lunge
the
graceful
curve
is
not
an
absolute
necessity
place
the
arm
behind
your
back
if
you
prefer
to
do
so
for
if
you
bring
it
to
the
front
you
drag
forward
the
left
shoulder
and
thereby
expose
a
larger
target
to
your
opponent
point
the
arm
you
see
acts
the
part
of
a
balancing
pole
it
steadies
the
movements
and
balances
the
weight
of
the
body
since
you
have
a
spare
arm
you
must
place
it
somewhere
and
if
you
consider
you
will
see
that
it
is
least
in
the
way
where
i
have
placed
it
it
serves
a
useful
purpose
in
the
general
arrangement
that
is
the
only
object
of
the
position
i
need
not
refine
the
point
further
in
fencing
the
movements
of
the
body
and
limbs
are
of
great
importance
all
the
mechanical
part
of
depends
on
the
principles
which
i
have
just
explained
i
have
now
taken
the
mechanism
to
pieces
and
shown
you
how
it
is
put
together
viii
one
word
more
what
was
the
reason
for
choosing
this
attitude
and
these
movements
they
were
chosen
because
they
are
natural
and
instinctive
instinct
dictated
the
rule
which
is
based
on
experience
on
practical
necessity
on
correct
principle
what
is
the
object
to
be
attained
first
for
defence
to
allow
the
limbs
their
complete
liberty
of
action
their
natural
elasticity
and
easy
play
secondly
for
attack
to
give
the
extension
of
the
body
its
full
force
now
try
to
change
the
position
straighten
your
legs
you
will
at
once
notice
the
increased
difficulty
of
executing
the
different
movements
whether
of
attack
defence
or
retreat
you
lose
your
balance
and
the
lunge
either
precedes
the
action
of
the
hand
and
the
extension
of
the
arm
or
follows
those
movements
too
late
the
legs
are
springs
which
support
the
body
and
determine
its
most
rapid
movements
if
you
are
out
shooting
and
want
to
jump
a
ditch
you
bend
your
legs
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
spring
or
again
if
you
jump
down
from
a
height
you
bend
your
legs
at
the
moment
your
feet
touch
the
ground
if
you
do
not
your
whole
body
is
jarred
i
dwell
on
this
point
in
order
to
convince
you
of
its
absolute
necessity
and
to
make
you
understand
clearly
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
position
but
i
repeat
instinct
was
the
first
teacher
experience
came
later
and
has
only
confirmed
the
principle
one
last
caution
when
once
you
have
learnt
by
practice
how
to
harmonise
your
movements
and
have
realised
how
great
a
power
at
a
given
moment
the
faculty
of
making
these
movements
with
ease
and
rapidity
may
be
then
and
not
till
then
venture
to
take
your
personal
inclination
into
account
and
if
after
carefully
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
can
owing
to
some
personal
peculiarity
improve
upon
the
elementary
rules
of
the
lesson
do
not
hesitate
to
depart
from
them
without
scruple
but
never
without
good
reason
the
best
position
is
that
which
allows
you
complete
freedom
and
perfect
balance
but
never
forget
that
all
exaggeration
is
bad
and
that
nothing
can
be
worse
than
the
exaggeration
of
an
ungraceful
and
ungainly
style
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
this
evening
illustration
the
left
shoulder
the
third
evening
illustration
i
we
will
continue
the
course
of
instruction
of
which
you
have
studied
at
present
only
the
first
page
i
am
going
into
very
minute
detail
as
you
see
our
scholar
now
knows
the
different
positions
and
can
appreciate
why
they
are
to
be
commended
and
what
is
to
be
gained
by
adopting
them
at
the
next
lesson
and
each
lesson
would
consist
of
not
more
than
three
bouts
of
eight
or
ten
minutes
each
i
should
show
him
and
make
him
execute
the
simple
attacks
and
the
simple
parries
in
tierce
and
quarte
straight
thrusts
the
cut
over
and
parries
of
quarte
and
the
attacks
will
exercise
him
in
the
lunge
the
parries
will
improve
the
flexibility
of
his
wrist
i
should
make
him
continually
retire
and
advance
i
should
even
at
this
early
stage
take
pains
to
secure
a
certain
degree
of
life
and
speed
in
his
execution
and
i
should
be
careful
to
vary
the
exercises
and
never
appeal
to
his
intelligence
at
the
risk
of
checking
the
activity
of
his
movements
sluggishness
i
repeat
is
a
deadly
foe
against
which
every
avenue
must
be
closed
from
the
very
first
next
i
should
go
on
to
composite
parries
and
composite
attacks
i
have
already
named
them
and
you
remember
that
they
are
not
very
numerous
and
combinations
of
the
and
are
the
most
useful
things
to
practise
because
they
work
the
wrist
in
every
direction
and
make
it
both
quick
and
supple
although
a
great
many
instructors
would
say
that
i
am
wrong
i
should
make
it
my
principal
aim
to
form
and
cultivate
a
habit
of
executing
all
movements
at
speed
i
should
insist
less
on
precision
of
control
than
on
smartness
of
execution
and
at
the
same
time
i
should
call
my
pupil
attention
to
the
mistakes
which
he
must
be
most
careful
to
avoid
and
to
the
points
of
danger
where
he
must
exercise
the
greatest
caution
i
should
practise
him
in
retiring
quickly
and
should
make
him
deliver
simple
attacks
on
the
march
keeping
his
blade
in
position
after
a
few
lessons
i
should
repeatedly
place
my
button
on
his
jacket
if
he
did
not
parry
quickly
enough
or
if
he
was
slow
on
the
recovery
in
a
word
i
should
put
plenty
of
life
and
go
into
my
lessons
from
the
first
and
not
allow
them
to
become
tedious
after
every
lesson
i
should
direct
his
serious
attention
to
the
principal
faults
i
had
noticed
and
i
should
make
him
understand
the
dangers
to
which
these
faults
must
inevitably
expose
him
for
instance
if
he
caught
the
fatal
trick
of
dropping
or
drawing
back
his
hand
i
should
take
care
to
make
him
attack
and
riposte
in
the
high
lines
in
order
to
get
him
to
carry
his
wrist
high
and
vice
versa
in
this
way
i
should
exercise
his
judgment
by
making
him
think
and
his
hand
and
body
by
keeping
him
closely
to
his
work
ii
above
all
the
master
lesson
must
not
lose
itself
in
a
maze
of
attacks
and
parries
and
ripostes
which
in
some
treatises
are
as
numerous
and
interminable
as
the
stars
of
heaven
the
strict
limitation
of
the
number
of
strokes
to
be
taught
renders
their
execution
proportionately
easier
and
makes
a
clear
impression
on
the
mind
experience
and
fencing
instinct
teach
far
better
than
any
lesson
certain
niceties
which
give
life
and
finish
and
character
to
the
play
there
you
have
the
lesson
complete
as
the
scholar
gradually
grows
stronger
he
learns
to
hold
himself
correctly
and
acquires
ease
he
understands
what
to
do
without
being
told
and
his
hand
is
in
a
fair
way
to
become
the
faithful
echo
of
his
thought
iii
we
here
touch
on
another
point
where
i
find
myself
at
variance
with
nearly
all
the
professional
instructors
i
have
read
in
the
books
which
deal
with
this
subject
of
danger
of
premature
loose
play
run
the
risk
say
some
spoiling
a
promising
pupil
and
of
arresting
his
future
progress
just
when
he
is
beginning
to
form
good
habits
others
go
further
and
declare
that
instructor
who
allows
his
pupil
to
commence
loose
play
too
soon
sacrifices
by
an
act
of
fatal
indulgence
the
whole
future
of
fencing
i
do
not
agree
with
this
view
i
can
not
even
see
that
it
logically
applies
to
those
who
mean
to
devote
all
their
time
to
the
study
of
and
who
are
prepared
to
make
a
determined
effort
to
reach
the
topmost
summit
of
this
difficult
art
much
less
then
to
my
mind
is
it
applicable
to
the
generality
of
men
who
have
no
ambition
to
become
such
learned
fencers
as
we
were
saying
the
other
evening
the
professors
wilfully
refuse
to
see
this
and
yet
of
all
arts
the
art
of
fencing
may
be
considered
from
the
most
widely
different
standpoints
and
particularly
may
be
approached
with
very
varied
degrees
of
knowledge
and
application
is
it
so
very
certain
that
loose
play
as
the
professors
love
to
call
it
is
so
pernicious
as
they
think
the
bad
seed
that
can
not
fail
to
produce
an
evil
crop
of
vices
right
or
wrong
i
can
only
say
once
more
that
i
am
of
quite
the
contrary
opinion
i
fail
to
see
that
it
is
dangerous
for
a
pupil
to
attempt
the
assault
when
he
has
learnt
by
taking
lessons
for
a
month
more
or
less
according
to
the
progress
made
and
his
natural
capacity
to
understand
the
various
strokes
i
have
described
and
can
already
execute
them
with
some
degree
of
liveliness
and
control
iv
of
course
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
his
first
assaults
like
all
first
attempts
that
require
a
trained
habit
of
mind
can
not
be
free
from
mistakes
exaggerations
faults
of
all
sorts
but
is
not
the
master
there
to
correct
these
errors
with
his
lesson
and
to
bring
his
pupil
who
is
inclined
to
go
astray
back
to
the
right
path
can
not
the
leading
strings
be
readjusted
the
very
fact
that
the
master
has
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
mistakes
to
which
his
pupil
is
most
liable
when
left
to
himself
enables
him
to
devote
all
his
care
to
overcome
and
correct
them
by
both
practice
and
precept
more
important
still
he
has
also
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
his
pupil
bias
he
notices
the
strokes
which
come
naturally
to
his
hand
the
parries
he
most
affects
the
natural
promptings
of
his
impulse
impetuous
or
cautious
as
the
case
may
be
he
makes
a
study
of
his
artless
scholar
who
is
clumsily
feeling
his
feet
reads
him
like
a
book
catches
him
in
the
act
so
to
speak
and
detects
the
working
of
his
character
and
thenceforward
he
knows
the
way
in
which
his
studies
may
be
most
profitably
directed
to
give
full
play
to
his
individual
temperament
the
assault
teaches
the
novice
what
no
amount
of
lunging
at
the
master
pad
can
drill
into
him
it
enters
him
to
the
sudden
emergencies
which
in
one
shape
or
another
arise
at
every
moment
to
the
movement
and
exertion
and
keen
emulation
of
real
fighting
the
assault
is
in
fact
a
lesson
subsidiary
to
the
formal
lesson
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
the
instruction
it
conveys
is
equally
salutary
then
smilingly
remarked
the
comte
de
you
are
for
open
war
with
the
existing
routine
and
with
the
old
traditions
yes
i
am
afraid
i
am
but
what
can
i
do
you
admit
the
force
of
my
arguments
certainly
and
that
fencing
taught
on
my
plan
loses
its
terrors
yes
i
quite
admit
that
and
in
fact
it
is
not
really
formidable
my
system
is
able
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
all
and
i
do
not
overshoot
the
mark
by
to
reach
it
it
is
most
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
not
necessary
or
even
desirable
to
attend
all
the
professor
lectures
to
pass
all
the
examinations
and
finally
to
qualify
as
bachelor
of
arms
in
order
to
become
a
fair
ordinary
fencer
after
all
in
every
art
one
usually
admits
the
professor
right
to
dictate
the
elementary
principles
of
his
subject
but
after
the
elementary
stage
is
passed
we
are
not
i
believe
always
ready
to
accept
the
professor
estimate
of
the
importance
of
the
art
which
he
happens
to
teach
the
remark
applies
equally
to
music
to
painting
to
literature
and
why
not
to
fencing
poets
we
know
are
nothing
if
not
but
why
should
fencers
be
singled
out
for
this
invidious
distinction
you
may
judge
how
firmly
my
own
belief
is
rooted
when
i
say
that
i
am
as
strongly
convinced
of
the
good
results
that
follow
from
assaults
as
i
am
of
the
necessity
of
making
the
lesson
as
simple
and
as
clear
as
possible
vi
i
remember
a
story
told
by
my
friend
desbarolles
an
artist
who
is
endowed
more
liberally
than
most
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
warm
artistic
temperament
it
is
to
be
found
in
one
of
his
neatly
written
essays
he
had
it
seems
studied
fencing
for
two
years
under
a
french
master
in
germany
i
think
when
he
paid
a
visit
to
charlemagne
one
of
the
most
famous
instructors
of
the
day
to
whom
he
had
an
introduction
he
fenced
before
the
professor
and
when
the
bout
was
over
expected
to
be
complimented
under
the
impression
that
he
had
done
rather
well
you
allow
me
sir
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
asked
the
great
man
all
means
replied
my
friend
let
me
recommend
you
to
give
up
loose
play
altogether
for
at
least
a
year
and
confine
your
attention
entirely
to
the
lesson
good
heavens
what
amazing
perversity
what
pompous
humbug
desbarolles
remarks
that
he
was
utterly
taken
aback
and
i
can
well
believe
him
but
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
accepted
the
verdict
and
never
had
reason
to
repent
it
if
he
had
not
given
his
word
for
the
fact
i
should
certainly
have
ventured
to
hope
most
sincerely
that
his
sense
of
humour
was
sufficient
to
save
him
from
following
such
a
piece
of
advice
to
the
letter
and
in
any
case
i
am
sure
that
it
was
quite
unnecessary
for
him
to
do
so
in
order
to
become
the
charming
fencer
that
he
is
and
one
for
whom
i
have
the
warmest
admiration
do
not
tell
me
that
the
quickness
of
hand
and
rapidity
of
movement
the
alertness
of
body
and
mind
required
in
loose
play
can
be
imparted
by
the
lessons
of
a
skilful
instructor
if
only
he
is
careful
to
graduate
his
instruction
in
proportion
to
his
pupil
progress
the
result
is
mere
with
the
professor
for
mainspring
counterfeit
vitality
set
in
motion
by
the
word
of
command
a
most
mechanical
use
of
the
intelligence
the
pupil
can
not
go
wrong
because
he
is
tied
to
his
master
the
master
sword
shows
him
exactly
where
to
go
with
the
precision
of
a
he
is
like
a
man
swimming
in
a
cork
jacket
practising
the
motions
of
swimming
at
his
leisure
and
not
caring
in
the
least
whether
these
motions
would
really
support
him
on
the
surface
or
let
him
sink
to
the
bottom
that
the
formal
lesson
is
useful
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
has
a
monopoly
of
usefulness
i
emphatically
deny
why
allow
it
to
meddle
with
and
domineer
over
things
which
do
not
concern
it
let
it
keep
its
place
and
refrain
from
trespassing
outside
its
own
dominions
the
lesson
can
explain
the
logic
and
theory
of
fencing
it
can
assign
reasons
and
exhibit
the
mechanical
process
but
it
can
not
deal
with
the
great
unknown
the
tricksy
spirit
which
suddenly
starts
out
on
the
fencer
under
every
shape
and
form
always
assuming
some
new
disguise
and
upsetting
in
a
moment
the
most
perfect
theories
and
the
most
scientific
combinations
the
young
fencer
who
undertakes
his
first
assault
is
like
the
heroic
youth
of
the
fairy
tales
who
leaves
his
humble
cottage
and
goes
out
into
the
wide
world
to
seek
his
fortune
like
him
he
will
meet
with
many
strange
adventures
which
will
try
his
mettle
put
his
character
to
the
touch
and
call
into
play
all
the
resources
of
his
intelligence
vii
perhaps
you
think
that
by
continually
presenting
this
question
to
you
in
a
new
light
i
am
detaining
you
too
long
on
one
part
of
my
subject
my
intention
is
to
bring
home
to
your
minds
the
conviction
i
so
strongly
feel
myself
if
you
only
knew
how
many
striking
examples
i
have
witnessed
of
the
truth
of
my
assertion
you
may
see
one
of
these
pupils
taking
his
lesson
he
is
a
magnificent
spectacle
his
hand
perfectly
correct
a
grand
lunge
his
action
smooth
and
free
he
follows
his
master
blade
through
a
cunning
series
of
feints
and
false
attacks
ripostes
and
his
parry
is
never
beaten
not
a
fault
not
a
single
mistake
he
is
an
animated
illustration
of
his
master
treatise
which
the
author
with
pardonable
pride
displays
before
you
now
in
the
assault
pupils
of
this
type
are
far
from
maintaining
their
superiority
their
mechanical
agility
is
paralysed
when
it
is
no
longer
set
in
motion
by
the
accustomed
spring
they
know
too
little
and
at
the
same
time
they
know
too
much
they
find
out
that
the
assault
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
lesson
their
opponent
blade
does
not
accommodate
itself
to
theirs
with
the
precision
to
which
they
are
accustomed
the
touch
of
the
steel
no
longer
conveys
those
delicate
hints
to
which
they
formerly
responded
with
such
alacrity
and
of
course
they
lose
their
bearings
they
have
not
acquired
the
sort
of
defence
which
is
ready
for
anything
alike
for
well
directed
thrusts
and
for
more
eccentric
methods
of
attack
and
they
look
in
vain
for
a
succession
of
passes
strictly
correlated
in
a
systematic
order
instead
of
marching
with
a
swing
along
the
broad
highway
to
which
they
are
accustomed
they
find
themselves
lost
in
a
wild
and
difficult
country
without
a
guide
and
without
confidence
habit
will
perhaps
enable
them
to
maintain
some
smartness
of
appearance
but
they
make
few
hits
and
in
spite
of
their
science
and
the
skill
which
they
undoubtedly
possess
up
to
a
certain
point
they
are
continually
beaten
by
fencers
who
are
less
scholarly
perhaps
but
who
have
been
better
entered
than
they
to
the
actual
combat
the
manifold
emergencies
of
practical
fighting
and
who
have
learnt
that
strange
language
by
which
the
sword
contrives
to
reveal
the
most
delicate
shades
of
meaning
i
have
seen
this
happen
so
often
that
i
have
taken
some
trouble
to
study
the
question
and
i
am
convinced
that
if
these
same
pupils
had
been
at
less
pains
to
make
themselves
pedantically
perfect
in
the
peaceful
and
philosophic
practice
of
the
lesson
and
had
been
made
familiar
at
an
early
stage
with
the
changing
incidents
of
the
assault
they
would
have
been
equally
well
disciplined
and
at
the
same
time
really
dangerous
fencers
of
course
i
freely
admit
that
exceptions
may
sometimes
be
found
but
they
are
the
exceptions
which
prove
the
rule
viii
we
have
now
reached
a
point
from
which
we
may
survey
the
thrilling
spectacle
of
the
assault
as
fencers
call
the
mimic
combat
in
which
desperate
and
brutal
fighting
is
controlled
by
skill
the
hazardous
duel
full
of
fire
and
fury
between
two
combatants
who
summon
to
their
aid
all
that
they
know
or
all
that
they
think
they
know
i
can
say
with
literal
truth
that
i
have
never
taken
a
foil
in
my
hand
for
a
serious
assault
without
feeling
a
real
tremor
and
most
fencers
have
experienced
and
indeed
are
generally
conscious
of
the
same
sensation
you
have
listened
so
kindly
to
my
rough
attempt
to
put
together
an
extemporary
course
of
instruction
that
i
can
confidently
claim
your
attention
now
for
we
are
about
to
find
in
this
great
arena
the
rival
systems
face
to
face
i
shall
put
before
you
and
examine
at
no
great
length
the
various
situations
which
are
likely
to
occur
our
imaginary
pupil
has
now
become
a
fencer
he
will
no
longer
lunge
merely
at
the
master
pad
henceforward
he
will
cover
his
manly
face
with
a
mask
shall
we
follow
him
in
his
career
we
will
replied
my
host
in
tragic
tones
the
standard
of
revolt
is
raised
lead
on
and
we
will
follow
you
is
well
i
answered
in
the
same
spirit
the
tryst
is
here
at
the
same
hour
illustration
parry
of
the
fourth
evening
illustration
i
the
next
day
i
continued
my
discourse
thus
in
the
assault
with
its
incessant
alarms
and
perilous
crises
in
encountering
the
wiles
and
avoiding
the
snares
of
the
enemy
those
who
use
the
sword
find
their
hour
of
glorious
life
the
hour
crowded
with
illusions
and
disenchantments
the
rubs
of
fortune
the
ups
and
downs
of
victory
or
defeat
what
legions
of
cunning
counsels
and
crafty
wiles
from
the
stratagem
down
to
the
sudden
surprise
one
finds
marshalled
in
the
and
how
unmanageable
and
superfluous
they
generally
are
all
that
the
spartan
mother
said
to
her
son
when
he
was
setting
out
for
the
wars
was
bold
be
resolute
be
cautious
do
not
her
words
contain
the
whole
for
all
fighting
whether
at
long
range
or
at
close
quarters
is
very
much
alike
from
schoolboys
games
to
the
most
elaborate
military
operations
and
all
the
advice
of
the
world
may
be
summed
up
in
the
eternal
law
of
attack
and
defence
which
is
stated
in
these
four
words
cunning
caution
energy
audacity
deceive
your
enemy
seize
the
critical
moment
to
attack
him
that
is
the
secret
of
fighting
cultivate
the
mistrust
which
suspects
the
hidden
snare
the
caution
which
frustrates
his
plots
combined
with
the
energy
and
audacity
which
surmount
difficulties
try
to
encourage
in
your
enemy
a
spirit
of
wanton
confidence
turn
a
strong
position
which
you
can
not
carry
by
a
direct
attack
threaten
one
point
when
you
mean
to
concentrate
your
whole
strength
on
another
draw
your
adversary
by
a
show
of
weakness
to
attack
you
in
your
strongest
position
keep
your
plans
secret
mask
your
approaches
and
then
by
the
sudden
impetuosity
of
your
attack
take
him
unawares
and
if
you
can
not
secure
a
victory
contrive
a
safe
retreat
such
from
the
earliest
times
have
been
the
methods
of
the
greatest
commanders
the
tactics
of
the
field
of
battle
and
the
tactics
of
fighting
are
identical
for
the
simple
reason
that
skill
or
strategy
or
science
call
it
what
you
will
are
but
different
names
to
express
the
same
idea
these
are
the
sage
counsels
the
rest
belongs
to
inspiration
the
inward
monitor
which
in
moments
of
danger
warns
us
with
tenfold
insistence
and
guides
us
right
too
much
stress
is
laid
on
education
too
little
on
individual
intelligence
the
lessons
are
supposed
to
have
trained
and
directed
this
intelligence
but
if
your
pupil
is
so
wanting
in
intelligence
that
he
can
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
game
if
he
can
never
rise
to
the
occasion
and
never
strike
out
a
line
of
his
own
what
can
you
expect
you
may
advise
for
ever
but
his
mind
will
not
respond
he
will
only
listen
and
forget
it
is
here
that
the
two
schools
begin
to
part
company
i
have
already
given
you
a
general
view
of
the
points
in
which
they
differ
and
we
need
not
now
recur
to
the
consideration
of
general
principles
with
which
you
are
already
acquainted
ii
if
we
could
return
to
the
past
and
witness
an
exhibition
of
as
it
was
understood
by
the
professors
of
only
fifty
years
ago
what
a
contrast
we
should
find
with
the
style
of
our
own
day
even
with
our
most
severely
classical
style
our
methods
would
certainly
be
called
revolutionary
it
was
usual
not
so
very
long
since
to
display
upon
the
bosom
a
fair
red
heart
stitched
to
the
fencing
jacket
to
show
plainly
for
all
eyes
to
see
the
spot
where
hits
should
be
placed
attacks
parries
and
ripostes
were
restricted
by
convention
to
a
very
narrow
circle
any
hit
that
went
wide
of
the
mark
was
accounted
execrable
and
received
with
the
most
profound
contempt
modern
fencing
is
inclined
to
be
somewhat
less
fastidious
hits
in
the
low
line
are
generally
acknowledged
but
a
hit
below
the
belt
really
do
not
expect
me
to
follow
your
point
down
there
is
still
the
attitude
of
most
fencers
it
a
hit
if
you
like
but
really
it
is
not
fencing
a
school
of
arms
you
know
is
not
a
school
of
surgery
you
might
leave
those
base
regions
to
the
medical
students
you
smile
but
i
assure
you
that
they
mean
it
seriously
without
the
least
sarcasm
it
is
quite
true
that
any
wound
in
that
despised
region
would
be
mortal
almost
to
a
certainty
that
is
a
detail
and
they
forget
that
a
sword
though
it
may
be
a
civil
and
gentlemanly
implement
is
still
a
lethal
weapon
it
really
is
very
strange
to
admit
that
it
is
wrong
to
disregard
the
deadly
character
of
the
point
when
aimed
in
one
direction
but
to
claim
that
it
is
right
to
disregard
it
when
aimed
in
another
yet
most
men
cling
to
this
error
with
the
utmost
pertinacity
that
you
should
despise
a
hit
in
the
leg
or
i
can
well
understand
by
all
means
concentrate
your
whole
attention
on
the
protection
of
the
parts
of
the
body
which
contain
the
vital
organs
but
not
to
use
your
utmost
care
your
surest
parries
your
most
anxious
precautions
to
defend
the
trunk
high
lines
and
low
always
has
been
and
is
still
a
delusion
a
delusion
which
those
who
attempt
to
draw
an
impossible
distinction
between
the
assaults
of
and
real
fighting
with
sharp
swords
vainly
ask
us
to
accept
as
an
unassailable
article
of
faith
there
is
a
real
distinction
for
after
all
can
only
be
an
imperfect
representation
of
real
fighting
our
object
should
be
to
make
the
resemblance
as
perfect
as
possible
and
so
minimise
the
chances
on
which
the
ignorant
and
brutal
too
confidently
rely
let
them
see
that
you
both
know
the
correct
answer
to
a
correct
combination
and
that
you
are
equally
prepared
to
deal
with
the
wild
and
disorderly
antics
of
an
untutored
point
iii
you
may
often
hear
men
say
do
that
in
the
fencing
room
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
attempt
it
in
a
serious
fight
then
why
attempt
it
at
all
if
your
judgment
tells
you
that
the
stroke
is
good
it
is
good
for
all
occasions
if
it
is
bad
it
can
not
be
justified
in
any
case
always
bear
in
mind
that
you
must
pay
attention
to
all
thrusts
which
might
prove
fatal
in
a
serious
encounter
and
then
if
some
day
you
have
the
misfortune
to
find
a
real
sword
in
your
hand
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
are
by
habit
against
known
and
familiar
dangers
i
can
not
emphasise
this
point
too
strongly
in
short
the
refusal
to
acknowledge
hits
however
low
is
a
dangerous
and
a
gratuitous
mistake
why
should
a
thrust
aimed
in
that
direction
not
be
of
its
kind
as
brilliant
and
meritorious
as
another
why
should
it
be
boycotted
is
there
any
reason
for
this
mysterious
taboo
the
old
master
who
used
to
teach
us
fencing
at
school
remarked
my
host
would
fall
foul
of
you
with
a
vengeance
if
he
heard
you
talk
like
that
i
do
not
mean
for
a
moment
i
replied
that
i
have
any
preference
for
hits
in
the
low
line
but
rather
that
i
am
more
afraid
of
them
because
i
have
fenced
too
often
with
fencers
good
and
bad
not
to
know
how
necessary
it
is
to
be
on
one
guard
against
the
dangers
of
wild
play
for
instance
those
who
make
a
practice
of
straightening
their
arm
as
they
retire
nearly
always
drop
their
hand
and
the
point
of
their
weapon
whether
they
wish
it
or
no
is
necessarily
directed
towards
the
low
line
it
is
equally
inevitable
that
the
same
part
should
be
threatened
by
those
who
rightly
or
wrongly
reverse
the
lunge
by
throwing
the
left
foot
back
on
your
attack
at
the
same
time
stooping
forwards
so
as
to
let
your
point
pass
over
their
head
and
ignorant
fencers
nearly
always
hit
you
there
quite
innocently
and
unintentionally
you
should
therefore
guard
that
part
of
the
body
as
strictly
as
you
guard
the
chest
and
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
when
you
meet
an
adversary
who
neglects
to
protect
the
low
line
annoy
him
in
that
region
frequently
iv
it
often
happens
that
things
that
are
most
neglected
in
one
age
become
the
ruling
fashions
of
the
next
just
as
things
once
highly
honoured
may
often
fall
into
complete
discredit
take
this
instance
in
an
old
and
dusty
folio
entitled
de
which
i
discovered
yesterday
banished
to
the
darkest
corner
of
the
library
i
found
several
pages
entirely
devoted
to
the
art
delivering
a
stroke
with
the
point
at
the
right
the
point
is
specified
because
in
those
days
cuts
and
thrusts
were
held
in
equal
favour
what
do
you
say
to
a
thrust
in
the
eye
and
yet
if
you
will
consult
my
folio
you
will
find
a
collection
of
plates
illustrating
all
the
passes
by
which
this
brilliant
stroke
may
be
brought
off
you
know
what
is
thought
of
a
hit
in
the
face
that
is
to
say
on
the
mask
we
are
taught
again
quite
wrongly
not
to
take
the
smallest
notice
of
it
and
this
leads
me
to
hope
that
some
day
we
may
yet
see
a
revolution
by
which
the
vulgar
belly
will
claim
its
rights
and
in
its
turn
drive
out
the
lordly
bosom
it
will
be
rated
too
highly
then
as
it
is
too
much
degraded
now
but
when
did
revolutions
ever
know
where
to
stop
for
the
assault
the
one
thing
needful
is
trust
to
your
own
resources
and
do
not
imagine
that
you
have
to
repeat
word
for
word
the
lesson
that
you
have
got
by
heart
from
your
book
but
rather
look
for
inspiration
to
the
resources
of
your
native
wit
if
any
one
came
to
me
for
advice
the
course
i
should
recommend
not
as
a
hard
and
fast
rule
but
in
a
general
way
would
be
something
of
this
sort
act
as
much
as
possible
on
the
defensive
keep
out
of
distance
in
order
to
prevent
your
opponent
from
attacking
you
without
shifting
his
position
and
in
order
to
compel
him
to
advance
on
your
point
the
most
dangerous
thing
he
can
do
and
without
a
doubt
the
most
difficult
art
to
acquire
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
stand
your
ground
whatever
happens
and
to
attack
always
in
exact
measure
instead
of
retiring
and
advancing
with
quick
and
irregular
movements
and
instead
of
trying
to
surprise
and
overwhelm
your
adversary
with
combinations
for
which
he
is
unprepared
you
are
to
my
mind
simply
acting
without
the
least
judgment
or
rather
you
are
making
a
perverse
blunder
then
i
should
go
on
to
say
always
supposing
that
i
was
asked
for
my
opinion
make
a
practice
of
stepping
back
as
you
form
the
parry
if
only
half
a
pace
there
is
everything
to
be
gained
by
it
and
there
is
no
objection
to
it
that
i
can
see
unless
it
be
the
strong
objection
that
your
opponent
will
feel
to
being
considerably
embarrassed
on
every
possible
occasion
the
advantages
on
the
other
hand
are
manifold
by
stepping
back
you
increase
the
effectiveness
of
the
parry
because
by
withdrawing
the
body
you
in
a
sense
double
the
rapidity
of
the
hand
if
the
attack
has
been
delivered
with
sufficient
rapidity
to
beat
the
parry
by
retiring
you
parry
twice
the
first
time
with
your
blade
with
which
you
try
to
find
your
adversary
weapon
the
second
time
by
removing
the
body
to
a
greater
distance
with
the
result
that
the
point
which
would
have
hit
you
if
you
had
stood
your
ground
does
not
reach
your
chest
by
employing
this
manoeuvre
against
simple
attacks
you
counteract
rapidity
of
execution
and
by
employing
it
against
composite
attacks
or
against
feints
you
encounter
the
last
movement
forcibly
it
is
also
of
service
in
screening
one
from
attacks
made
by
drawing
back
the
arm
for
it
often
happens
if
you
stand
your
ground
that
your
hand
starts
too
soon
and
your
sword
encounters
nothing
but
empty
air
it
has
the
further
advantage
of
increasing
the
fencer
confidence
in
himself
do
not
imagine
that
it
hinders
the
riposte
it
renders
it
easier
and
more
certain
nearly
always
when
a
fencer
has
lunged
right
out
and
as
often
happens
does
not
recover
immediately
the
two
opponents
are
so
close
together
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
in
the
riposte
without
shortening
the
arm
and
so
giving
an
opportunity
for
a
the
parry
and
riposte
without
breaking
ground
are
certainly
of
value
i
do
not
dispute
that
but
against
the
fencers
of
all
sorts
whom
you
have
to
meet
and
who
offer
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
difficulty
they
should
not
be
employed
except
occasionally
and
only
when
they
are
almost
certain
to
succeed
to
my
mind
it
would
be
dangerous
and
unreasonable
to
adopt
them
as
the
systematic
basis
of
your
play
vi
my
reason
for
insisting
so
strongly
on
this
point
is
that
i
have
nearly
always
found
that
it
is
thought
to
be
very
magnificent
to
stand
up
to
the
parry
whereas
breaking
ground
is
regarded
as
the
shift
of
a
man
hard
pressed
a
last
resort
when
the
hand
has
proved
too
slow
or
when
it
is
necessary
to
retrieve
an
error
of
judgment
now
my
plan
provides
you
with
a
second
line
of
defence
without
infringing
any
of
the
recognised
canons
it
is
consistent
with
the
most
classical
style
and
with
perfect
control
of
your
weapon
and
one
may
well
ask
why
when
two
chances
of
safety
are
at
your
disposal
you
should
deliberately
resolve
to
avail
yourself
of
only
one
of
them
i
should
accordingly
reverse
the
usual
advice
thus
a
general
rule
and
on
principle
break
ground
as
you
parry
either
by
a
few
inches
or
by
a
clear
pace
according
to
the
momentum
of
your
opponent
attack
for
by
breaking
ground
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
are
to
avoid
a
hit
by
continual
and
precipitate
bolting
stand
firm
but
only
when
you
are
sure
that
you
have
at
last
induced
your
opponent
to
develope
an
attack
which
you
have
long
been
waiting
for
him
to
make
vii
unless
i
know
my
man
or
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
beforehand
i
have
very
little
faith
in
a
prolonged
concatenation
of
parries
ripostes
and
and
here
again
i
should
try
to
relieve
the
mind
as
much
as
may
be
from
an
unnecessary
burden
by
getting
rid
of
complications
instead
of
multiplying
them
i
look
at
it
in
this
way
if
a
fencer
has
to
concern
himself
with
the
different
lines
in
which
he
may
be
attacked
he
must
be
in
a
state
of
continual
suspense
he
will
be
continually
asking
himself
whether
the
attack
is
coming
in
the
inside
line
or
the
outside
in
the
high
line
or
the
low
thus
in
order
to
parry
to
advantage
and
correctly
he
must
wait
until
his
enemy
object
is
clearly
disclosed
take
the
case
of
a
simple
attack
promptly
executed
it
is
obvious
that
the
attacker
must
gain
a
considerable
start
true
there
are
a
few
fencers
but
very
few
gifted
with
so
fine
a
sense
of
touch
that
they
can
divine
their
adversary
intention
and
read
his
inmost
thought
less
gifted
mortals
should
be
content
with
a
parry
which
mechanically
traverses
all
the
lines
such
a
parry
must
of
necessity
encounter
the
adverse
blade
forcibly
in
whichever
line
the
enemy
has
selected
for
his
attack
when
once
you
have
acquired
this
universal
parry
the
strain
is
lessened
your
mind
is
more
at
ease
you
are
more
sure
of
yourself
and
feel
that
you
can
act
with
certainty
and
decision
viii
there
are
two
kinds
of
parry
among
those
which
i
enumerated
the
other
day
which
answer
this
purpose
equally
well
the
first
consists
in
combining
the
parry
of
or
with
a
and
beat
in
the
second
in
parrying
and
in
succession
and
vice
versa
or
and
these
covering
parries
though
they
are
technically
composite
in
practice
are
fairly
simple
and
rapidly
pass
through
all
the
lines
that
are
open
to
attack
choose
the
one
which
you
prefer
instinctively
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
one
that
comes
most
naturally
to
your
hand
or
if
you
like
use
sometimes
one
sometimes
the
other
but
what
if
this
parry
is
deceived
asked
the
comte
de
well
i
answered
no
cheating
is
the
fencer
motto
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
attack
that
can
not
be
parried
or
a
parry
that
can
not
be
deceived
sooner
or
later
the
fatal
moment
comes
and
superior
activity
or
superior
cunning
prevails
if
any
professor
can
invent
an
attack
which
it
is
impossible
to
resist
or
a
parry
which
it
is
impossible
to
deceive
i
should
advise
him
to
take
very
good
care
to
secure
the
patent
rights
of
his
invention
without
a
moment
delay
he
would
certainly
have
no
difficulty
in
floating
a
company
to
put
it
on
the
market
in
all
the
capitals
of
europe
i
have
already
expressed
my
opinion
that
a
fencer
strength
lies
much
more
in
presence
of
mind
and
in
quickness
of
hand
than
in
a
very
varied
play
this
is
so
true
that
the
majority
of
fencers
amateur
and
professional
alike
affect
certain
favourite
strokes
they
have
favourite
attacks
favourite
parries
and
ripostes
and
always
come
back
to
them
as
to
old
friends
on
whose
services
they
can
confidently
rely
in
the
course
of
an
assault
the
same
stroke
is
often
repeated
in
many
different
ways
the
shape
it
takes
changes
with
the
changing
incidents
of
the
fight
and
accordingly
as
it
is
adapted
to
suit
the
peculiarities
of
the
individual
against
whom
it
is
employed
that
is
the
great
beauty
of
a
stroke
in
fencing
some
of
you
i
know
are
not
fencers
but
there
are
one
or
two
connoisseurs
present
who
have
studied
the
art
and
are
experts
it
is
to
them
that
i
now
appeal
as
an
illustration
of
my
argument
i
will
take
the
most
simple
parry
the
parry
of
quarte
and
i
will
ask
them
if
it
is
not
the
fact
that
it
constantly
changes
and
undergoes
surprising
transformations
sometimes
it
is
a
light
touch
sometimes
a
vigorous
almost
a
violent
blow
it
may
form
a
high
parry
it
may
form
a
low
parry
it
serves
for
every
purpose
and
answers
every
call
that
can
be
made
upon
it
watch
the
blade
as
the
parry
is
formed
perhaps
it
just
meets
the
adverse
blade
and
suddenly
quits
it
or
it
may
hold
and
dominate
it
it
is
this
power
of
varying
the
stroke
and
transforming
it
at
will
that
marks
the
true
fencer
the
man
i
repeat
who
is
content
to
recite
his
lesson
by
rote
however
well
he
has
learnt
it
can
never
be
anything
more
than
a
call
him
that
or
an
accomplished
parrot
whichever
he
prefers
ix
i
was
reading
one
of
the
ancient
treatises
which
are
reposing
peacefully
on
your
dusty
shelves
my
dear
when
i
came
across
the
following
passage
which
rather
struck
my
fancy
law
of
defence
declares
that
your
motions
should
be
the
natural
motions
of
a
man
body
but
however
sacred
the
dignity
of
law
may
be
nevertheless
you
ought
to
consider
that
necessity
knows
no
law
and
that
it
overrides
even
the
weightiest
laws
of
human
that
was
written
in
the
maxim
is
a
trifle
too
sweeping
for
general
application
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
good
and
serviceable
maxim
when
applied
to
my
remarks
are
perhaps
somewhat
disconnected
i
am
simply
giving
you
my
ideas
at
random
as
they
occur
to
me
but
my
main
object
is
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
points
which
appear
to
me
of
some
importance
after
the
parries
come
the
ripostes
on
this
subject
a
few
words
will
suffice
never
forget
that
the
parry
and
riposte
are
twin
sisters
whose
lives
are
so
closely
bound
up
in
each
other
that
they
can
not
exist
apart
riposte
and
parry
ought
to
be
so
closely
allied
that
the
riposte
may
seem
to
be
the
second
part
of
the
parry
therefore
as
a
general
principle
riposte
direct
in
the
line
in
which
you
have
found
the
blade
changing
the
line
wastes
time
and
gives
your
adversary
an
opportunity
to
pull
himself
together
and
make
a
or
renew
the
attack
never
on
any
consideration
allow
yourself
to
draw
back
your
arm
for
then
your
riposte
is
lost
as
well
throw
your
purse
in
the
gutter
if
your
judgment
tells
you
that
your
adversary
is
waiting
for
your
direct
riposte
and
has
attacked
you
with
the
object
of
drawing
it
or
if
you
have
noticed
that
he
covers
himself
effectively
on
that
side
while
he
leaves
you
a
clear
opening
elsewhere
then
avoid
the
trap
by
a
disengagement
or
a
but
only
make
one
feint
never
more
than
one
for
if
you
do
though
you
may
succeed
once
you
will
probably
find
out
later
that
your
success
was
dearly
bought
it
is
always
wise
you
know
to
count
the
cost
and
economise
your
resources
unless
you
wish
to
take
the
straight
road
to
ruin
x
our
chat
i
remarked
after
a
moment
silence
if
it
has
not
been
very
long
has
at
least
been
very
serious
i
only
complain
that
you
have
not
sufficiently
interrupted
me
we
have
been
listening
to
you
said
the
comte
de
very
attentively
because
you
warned
us
of
the
importance
of
your
subject
very
well
my
dear
i
replied
now
just
imagine
you
are
in
court
and
let
us
hear
how
you
would
sum
up
the
case
for
the
benefit
of
the
jury
i
fancy
i
can
do
that
rather
well
answered
let
me
try
the
lesson
you
say
is
the
the
assault
is
the
career
a
free
field
for
enterprise
where
he
must
stand
or
fall
by
dint
of
his
own
unaided
genius
the
only
counsels
which
are
worth
anything
are
those
which
have
governed
attack
and
defence
from
time
immemorial
for
attack
the
union
of
desperate
energy
with
cool
and
calculating
caution
for
defence
firmness
wariness
then
passing
from
the
general
question
to
points
of
detail
or
execution
i
should
add
it
is
a
great
mistake
a
piece
of
inconceivable
folly
to
have
boycotted
to
use
your
own
expression
hits
in
the
very
low
lines
because
the
fencer
is
prevented
thereby
from
acquiring
the
habit
of
strictly
guarding
those
parts
of
the
body
where
in
a
serious
encounter
any
wound
would
probably
prove
fatal
as
a
general
rule
step
back
as
you
form
the
parry
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
and
to
give
greater
freedom
to
your
riposte
stand
your
ground
only
when
you
think
you
have
judged
the
stroke
to
a
nicety
and
when
you
hold
your
adversary
in
a
tight
place
from
which
he
can
not
escape
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
my
dear
i
remarked
you
have
summarised
most
excellently
the
points
that
i
have
worked
out
in
detail
and
you
have
exactly
caught
my
meaning
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
answered
but
let
me
finish
in
order
to
keep
your
wits
about
you
and
to
avoid
trying
to
think
of
too
many
things
at
once
adopt
as
a
rule
a
universal
parry
which
will
cut
all
the
lines
and
must
meet
and
drive
away
your
opponent
blade
always
riposte
direct
and
be
careful
on
your
riposte
to
avoid
making
feints
which
expose
you
to
a
or
to
a
renewal
of
the
attack
does
that
satisfy
you
you
have
taken
us
over
the
ground
most
admirably
my
dear
professor
i
propose
to
discuss
the
attack
and
in
this
connection
we
shall
have
to
consider
what
is
usually
called
sentiment
du
the
fencer
sense
of
touch
to
this
sovereign
principle
we
are
asked
to
swear
allegiance
as
though
it
occupied
the
throne
by
divine
right
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
the
pretensions
of
another
claimant
of
very
noble
lineage
to
a
share
of
the
royal
honours
illustration
riposte
in
the
fifth
evening
illustration
i
although
our
conversation
was
quite
informal
and
simply
an
amusement
i
found
that
it
involved
diligent
preparation
especially
when
i
was
approaching
one
of
the
questions
where
i
was
in
open
conflict
with
current
theories
which
are
often
taken
for
granted
on
no
better
ground
than
their
respectable
antiquity
one
of
these
theories
which
is
described
in
fencing
language
as
the
importance
of
judging
the
blade
by
touch
i
was
now
prepared
to
challenge
and
i
was
ready
to
maintain
the
superiority
of
another
principle
against
which
the
professors
raise
their
voices
almost
with
one
accord
in
a
chorus
of
unmerited
abuse
accordingly
when
we
assembled
in
the
i
took
my
usual
seat
and
began
without
preface
ii
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
what
is
meant
by
refusing
to
join
blades
it
means
that
as
soon
as
you
have
come
on
guard
you
break
away
from
the
engagement
and
avoid
crossing
swords
with
your
adversary
instead
of
allowing
the
blades
to
remain
in
contact
this
i
consider
was
one
of
the
most
successful
innovations
of
what
it
is
the
fashion
to
call
new
school
and
i
am
therefore
very
far
from
sharing
the
opinions
of
the
professors
who
discover
in
the
practice
the
corruption
of
the
best
traditions
of
and
declare
that
the
refusal
to
join
blades
is
equivalent
to
fencing
blindfold
and
without
judgment
it
leads
they
say
to
mutual
hits
and
deprives
the
fencer
of
one
of
the
finest
accomplishments
he
can
acquire
the
power
of
judging
the
sword
by
touch
iii
undoubtedly
the
fencer
touch
is
a
great
resource
i
am
even
willing
to
allow
that
it
is
invaluable
and
it
is
a
thing
that
can
only
be
obtained
by
practice
and
perseverance
it
gives
lightness
and
dexterity
to
the
hand
and
enables
the
foil
to
be
manipulated
with
accuracy
and
speed
it
is
the
refined
result
that
is
derived
from
extreme
ease
in
regulating
the
extension
of
the
arm
from
exquisite
subtlety
in
the
use
of
the
fingers
and
from
precision
of
play
which
involves
its
victim
almost
unawares
dismays
and
utterly
confounds
him
i
profess
the
greatest
admiration
for
this
consummate
power
of
fence
so
seldom
seen
to
perfection
no
one
can
think
more
highly
of
it
than
i
do
and
on
that
account
i
am
strongly
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
devising
a
means
to
resist
it
when
it
is
used
against
me
i
shall
perhaps
be
told
to
combat
it
by
an
equally
fine
sense
of
touch
but
it
is
still
more
rare
to
see
a
bout
of
fencing
in
which
the
two
men
are
evenly
matched
in
this
respect
and
general
principles
should
be
based
on
general
grounds
not
on
exceptional
cases
the
man
who
possesses
this
consummate
sleight
of
touch
may
almost
be
said
to
control
his
opponent
blade
by
the
exercise
of
his
will
by
a
sort
of
hypnotic
influence
or
fascination
he
does
with
it
what
he
pleases
if
you
refuse
the
engagement
you
create
a
difficulty
for
him
if
you
do
not
allow
him
to
bring
his
blade
into
contact
with
yours
you
put
an
impediment
in
his
way
which
his
skill
will
doubtless
overcome
but
with
less
certainty
his
course
is
not
so
clear
and
he
is
no
longer
completely
master
of
the
situation
for
if
you
join
blades
you
are
always
within
striking
distance
of
his
point
that
is
to
say
he
can
attack
you
at
any
moment
without
shifting
his
ground
now
such
attacks
are
exceedingly
difficult
to
stop
even
for
the
most
practised
hand
especially
simple
attacks
such
as
straight
thrusts
or
simple
disengagements
the
mind
perpetually
held
in
suspense
is
harassed
and
distressed
you
have
no
leisure
to
think
for
yourself
and
are
demoralised
by
the
slow
torture
of
a
constant
strain
for
i
repeat
it
is
very
rare
to
find
two
fencers
so
evenly
matched
in
this
respect
that
the
risk
is
equally
divided
in
that
case
i
should
say
what
you
please
in
the
other
case
refusing
the
engagement
you
can
at
first
keep
your
opponent
out
of
distance
which
will
compel
him
to
advance
in
order
to
attack
you
and
so
give
you
fair
warning
of
his
intention
you
are
no
longer
exposed
to
the
paralysing
influence
of
a
constantly
threatened
attack
which
destroys
your
liberty
of
action
and
judgment
you
disconcert
your
adversary
by
leaving
him
in
the
dark
as
to
the
line
in
which
he
will
encounter
your
blade
and
you
can
choose
your
own
time
when
you
are
ready
to
attack
or
parry
to
engage
his
blade
with
decision
for
my
own
part
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
the
system
is
a
safe
and
sound
defensive
measure
which
offers
advantages
that
can
not
be
denied
pressures
binds
beats
and
all
those
dangerous
movements
by
which
your
opponent
can
bring
the
of
his
blade
to
bear
on
the
of
yours
are
rendered
very
difficult
to
perform
and
are
much
less
likely
to
succeed
surprise
attacks
are
entirely
or
at
least
so
nearly
eliminated
that
their
occurrence
is
a
rare
event
iv
i
have
endeavoured
to
state
as
clearly
as
possible
the
advantages
that
a
weak
fencer
may
derive
from
this
system
when
he
is
opposed
to
a
combatant
more
experienced
and
more
skilful
than
himself
but
further
than
that
i
believe
that
the
skilful
and
experienced
fencer
has
also
something
to
gain
by
adopting
this
much
despised
method
i
have
myself
never
been
able
to
discover
that
it
is
incompatible
with
perfect
or
that
it
tends
to
wild
play
it
opens
a
wider
field
it
shows
the
fallacy
of
certain
ideas
which
have
been
wrongly
supposed
to
be
unassailable
and
it
furnishes
a
whole
range
of
new
situations
another
world
to
conquer
what
ground
is
there
i
would
ask
my
critic
for
your
assertion
that
i
must
be
fencing
blindly
because
my
sword
does
not
happen
to
be
in
constant
touch
with
yours
why
do
you
say
that
mutual
hits
must
occur
more
frequently
if
you
are
talking
of
a
pair
of
duffers
who
charge
each
other
blindly
you
may
trust
them
to
commit
every
possible
blunder
whether
they
join
blades
or
not
but
why
should
you
exalt
so
highly
what
you
call
the
faculty
of
touch
the
power
of
judging
the
blade
by
touch
and
be
so
ready
to
degrade
that
other
sovereign
principle
which
may
be
called
the
faculty
of
sight
the
power
of
judging
the
sword
by
eye
can
you
deny
the
controlling
influence
of
the
eye
the
authority
that
belongs
to
it
do
you
believe
that
the
eye
can
not
be
trained
to
the
same
degree
of
nicety
as
the
hand
why
when
you
have
these
two
forces
at
your
disposal
are
you
content
to
let
one
of
them
do
duty
for
both
you
may
keep
your
opponent
at
his
distance
by
the
menace
of
your
nimble
point
which
flashes
in
his
sight
incessantly
while
your
watchful
eye
follows
the
movements
of
his
sword
and
reads
his
thought
as
well
as
if
the
blades
were
crossed
and
questioned
each
other
by
the
language
of
the
steel
then
when
it
suits
your
convenience
when
you
see
a
favourable
opportunity
when
you
have
by
a
rapid
calculation
reckoned
up
the
situation
weighed
the
chances
taken
everything
into
account
then
is
the
time
to
offer
your
sword
then
is
the
time
to
engage
your
adversary
or
by
bold
decided
movements
to
get
control
of
his
blade
but
objected
one
of
my
hearers
what
if
your
adversary
adopts
the
same
tactics
and
refuses
the
engagement
that
is
where
science
and
strength
skill
and
personal
superiority
tell
what
is
fencing
if
it
is
not
the
art
of
leading
your
opponent
into
a
trap
the
art
of
making
him
think
that
he
will
be
attacked
in
one
place
when
you
mean
to
hit
him
in
another
the
skill
to
outwit
his
calculations
to
master
his
game
paralyse
his
action
outmanoeuvre
him
reduce
him
to
impotence
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
the
accomplished
fencer
sets
himself
to
do
your
adversary
you
say
will
not
come
to
an
engagement
very
good
then
you
must
force
him
to
it
by
feints
or
by
threatening
to
attack
either
he
attempts
to
parry
or
he
attempts
to
thrust
in
either
case
you
get
command
of
his
blade
by
a
simple
or
by
a
double
beat
as
the
case
may
be
and
then
you
drive
your
attack
home
it
holds
good
with
fencing
as
it
does
with
all
warlike
measures
whether
on
a
large
scale
or
small
that
you
must
not
wait
for
what
you
want
to
be
brought
to
you
you
must
learn
to
help
yourself
take
no
denial
but
by
force
or
fraud
get
possession
now
i
appeal
to
you
all
as
critics
not
on
a
technical
question
of
fencing
on
which
no
one
can
be
expected
to
give
an
opinion
without
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
art
but
on
a
simpler
matter
i
will
contrast
two
assaults
imagine
that
you
are
the
spectators
the
first
is
between
two
fencers
of
the
classical
school
to
use
the
conventional
phrase
the
swords
are
crossed
and
the
two
adversaries
both
gifted
with
consummate
skill
stand
facing
each
other
foot
to
foot
feint
follows
feint
and
parry
parry
a
simple
attack
is
delivered
it
is
succeeded
by
a
combination
the
attitudes
of
both
are
irreproachable
the
body
always
upright
the
quick
hand
with
exquisite
finesse
manipulates
the
dancing
point
by
subtle
and
accurate
you
admire
the
exhibition
for
a
moment
you
follow
the
quick
passage
of
the
blades
but
your
sympathies
are
not
aroused
you
are
not
carried
away
or
enthralled
in
spite
of
yourself
in
a
fever
of
anxious
expectation
now
turn
to
the
other
assault
this
also
is
fought
by
two
skilful
fencers
but
they
go
to
work
on
quite
a
different
system
look
at
the
combatants
instead
of
standing
foot
to
foot
and
blade
to
blade
they
are
out
of
distance
on
the
alert
ready
to
strike
but
cautious
their
eyes
follow
each
other
and
watch
for
the
movement
suddenly
they
close
the
blades
cross
interlock
and
break
away
that
was
a
searching
thrust
but
by
a
sudden
retreat
a
rapid
movement
perhaps
a
leap
backwards
the
fencer
evades
the
hit
and
is
ready
on
the
instant
to
give
back
the
point
this
assault
is
a
battle
between
two
men
who
mean
hard
fighting
keen
swordsmen
dodgy
artful
and
slippery
who
bring
to
bear
all
their
science
employ
every
trick
they
can
think
of
and
throw
themselves
body
and
soul
into
the
fight
now
let
me
ask
you
which
of
these
two
assaults
is
the
more
interesting
to
follow
vi
i
remember
an
assault
in
pons
rooms
between
one
of
my
friends
and
a
man
who
was
generally
considered
and
really
was
a
strong
fencer
although
he
insisted
on
clinging
to
that
mischievous
routine
which
with
some
men
is
a
superstition
they
came
on
guard
and
my
friend
after
crossing
swords
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
defend
himself
quitted
the
engagement
attacked
and
hit
his
opponent
several
times
sir
his
opponent
objected
do
not
join
blades
should
i
you
join
blades
how
am
i
to
fence
is
your
you
must
join
blades
i
my
only
object
i
assure
you
is
to
endeavour
as
well
as
i
am
able
to
disconcert
my
opponent
and
as
i
find
that
this
plan
disconcerts
you
considerably
i
see
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
continue
to
employ
it
may
be
rejoined
the
other
sticking
to
his
point
if
you
do
not
join
blades
it
is
not
fencing
said
my
friend
us
try
for
a
moment
to
discuss
the
matter
tell
me
are
my
hits
improperly
delivered
no
i
stab
or
come
in
with
a
there
anything
wrong
with
my
parries
are
they
too
wide
or
what
is
my
hand
too
heavy
or
do
you
complain
of
mutual
hits
that
is
not
the
point
what
more
do
you
want
want
you
to
join
blades
oblige
you
i
do
not
say
that
but
unless
you
join
blades
it
is
not
fencing
and
say
what
one
might
nothing
would
make
him
budge
from
his
everlasting
axiom
it
is
always
so
whenever
an
attempt
is
made
to
interfere
with
the
traditions
of
any
art
whatever
the
man
who
tries
to
strike
out
a
new
line
can
not
fail
to
disturb
the
tranquil
repose
of
ancient
custom
the
conservatives
resist
they
object
to
interference
they
feel
that
their
placid
triumphs
their
cherished
habits
are
threatened
the
regular
routine
which
has
been
drilled
into
them
till
they
know
it
like
an
old
tune
of
which
every
turn
and
every
note
is
familiar
will
be
unsettled
they
have
good
reason
to
be
annoyed
but
that
does
not
prove
them
to
be
right
vii
at
the
present
day
people
have
gradually
come
to
admit
that
there
is
some
good
in
these
innovations
which
have
suddenly
enlarged
the
scope
of
fencing
they
say
more
difficult
than
it
used
to
be
but
less
graceful
are
these
qualities
then
necessarily
incompatible
with
each
other
in
order
to
make
a
clear
distinction
between
those
who
run
after
strange
gods
and
the
lichts
who
have
preserved
intact
the
primitive
tradition
of
the
true
faith
a
phrase
has
been
invented
to
describe
the
backsliders
they
are
said
to
be
fencers
now
what
are
these
words
supposed
to
mean
do
they
imply
that
a
graceful
fencer
is
not
difficult
no
doubt
classical
grace
and
a
masterly
style
are
very
fine
things
which
i
for
one
can
appreciate
and
admire
but
if
i
am
asked
to
choose
between
the
graceful
and
the
difficult
fencer
if
it
is
not
possible
to
be
both
at
once
i
much
prefer
the
latter
for
i
suppose
that
can
only
mean
difficult
to
hit
difficult
to
defeat
but
there
is
no
need
to
suppose
that
difficulty
is
incompatible
with
grace
at
least
with
grace
of
a
certain
kind
the
grace
of
manly
and
robust
energy
which
sits
well
upon
the
fighting
man
such
grace
as
in
old
times
so
well
became
the
gallant
chevaliers
who
illumined
by
their
prowess
the
spacious
days
of
ruff
and
rapier
we
have
here
another
of
the
important
points
of
difference
between
the
two
schools
some
people
treat
the
newcomer
like
an
inconvenient
guest
whom
they
can
not
very
well
turn
out
of
doors
but
they
may
as
well
make
up
their
minds
that
the
intruder
can
take
care
of
himself
and
will
find
room
for
his
ample
proportions
in
the
domestic
circle
he
has
come
to
stay
and
whether
they
like
him
or
not
he
means
to
make
one
of
the
party
the
axiom
and
do
not
be
hit
back
ought
in
spite
of
everything
that
can
be
said
against
it
to
be
the
motto
of
all
who
fight
with
the
sword
science
may
teach
how
to
hit
well
but
its
first
lesson
should
be
how
not
to
be
hit
at
all
by
the
arrant
duffer
who
uses
his
sword
by
the
light
of
nature
when
swordsmanship
fails
to
keep
this
end
in
view
we
may
be
very
sure
that
it
is
off
the
track
must
be
the
invariable
rule
viii
there
was
a
time
when
the
mask
was
not
worn
for
the
assault
and
i
remember
reading
some
time
ago
in
the
published
about
the
middle
of
last
century
under
the
word
the
following
remarks
fencers
have
sometimes
carried
precaution
so
far
as
to
wear
a
mask
to
protect
themselves
from
possible
hits
in
the
face
it
is
true
that
those
who
have
acquired
little
skill
in
the
art
may
chance
to
wound
their
adversary
by
a
clumsy
thrust
or
cause
themselves
to
be
wounded
by
throwing
up
the
point
with
a
bad
parry
it
is
however
never
worn
at
the
present
day
this
encyclopaedia
evidently
reflects
the
ideas
which
were
generally
accepted
at
the
time
to
wear
a
mask
in
a
bout
with
the
foils
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
considered
your
opponent
a
duffer
and
was
not
far
short
of
an
insult
fencing
in
those
days
was
nothing
but
a
formal
series
of
attacks
feints
parries
and
ripostes
well
understood
and
defined
by
the
code
every
movement
led
up
to
some
other
movement
which
was
rigidly
prescribed
if
a
fencer
had
ventured
on
a
straight
thrust
while
the
feints
were
in
progress
instead
of
elaborately
following
the
blade
through
every
turn
of
the
labyrinth
he
would
have
been
considered
an
unmannerly
cub
and
sent
back
to
study
his
rudiments
it
was
only
in
the
last
years
of
the
period
signalised
by
the
famous
that
the
mask
came
into
general
use
even
then
the
only
masks
used
were
made
of
tin
and
the
professors
view
was
that
such
safeguards
were
permissible
for
rough
players
but
it
so
happened
that
three
professors
each
lost
an
eye
and
their
respect
for
ancient
tradition
did
not
go
far
enough
to
induce
them
to
risk
losing
the
one
that
remained
after
that
the
wire
mask
was
generally
adopted
but
not
without
regret
ix
every
generation
takes
the
march
of
progress
one
stage
further
or
at
least
modifies
existing
institutions
in
its
own
way
it
is
not
so
long
since
the
fanciful
multiplication
of
feints
of
which
i
was
speaking
just
now
was
considered
the
correct
game
the
right
thing
to
do
was
to
follow
the
blade
until
you
found
it
at
the
present
day
it
is
no
longer
part
of
the
necessary
ritual
to
follow
always
every
vagary
suppose
you
feint
inordinately
i
suddenly
let
drive
with
opposition
of
the
hand
or
simply
straighten
my
arm
and
hit
you
with
a
stop
thrust
which
interferes
rather
effectively
with
your
trickiness
and
spoils
the
magnificent
flourishes
of
your
arabesques
these
hits
are
now
recognised
and
regularly
taught
if
need
be
instead
of
lunging
you
slip
the
left
foot
to
the
rear
throw
the
left
shoulder
well
back
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
drop
the
body
in
order
to
avoid
being
hit
yourself
the
system
of
our
fathers
which
in
many
respects
was
excellent
but
at
the
same
time
was
remarkable
for
several
very
odd
and
very
peremptory
theories
has
in
many
instances
been
successfully
assailed
perhaps
in
some
cases
its
assailants
have
themselves
been
too
peremptory
and
this
has
led
to
that
loss
of
temper
and
angry
recrimination
by
which
the
debate
has
been
embittered
but
i
must
not
tax
your
patience
further
we
had
better
adjourn
the
discussion
until
otherwise
you
will
be
tired
of
hearing
me
talk
and
i
am
sincerely
anxious
to
command
your
whole
attention
illustration
the
sixth
evening
illustration
very
old
i
fencing
i
began
when
we
had
all
reassembled
as
usual
is
such
an
inexhaustible
topic
that
i
could
not
if
i
would
pretend
to
go
minutely
into
all
its
practical
details
no
one
gifted
with
a
modicum
of
sense
a
little
determination
and
a
dash
of
enterprise
can
fail
to
strike
out
a
line
for
himself
i
am
obliged
as
you
see
to
content
myself
with
a
general
view
for
we
can
not
consider
the
assault
and
especially
an
assault
in
which
the
combatants
use
their
heads
as
well
as
their
hands
without
assuming
that
our
young
friend
has
gained
some
science
and
has
become
an
educated
fencer
i
have
already
spoken
of
parries
and
ripostes
and
you
have
seen
that
the
lesson
teaches
how
these
should
be
employed
you
know
what
use
may
be
made
of
the
sense
of
touch
the
power
of
feeling
the
blade
and
of
the
electric
influence
of
the
eye
it
remains
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
attacks
it
is
more
dangerous
to
attack
than
to
parry
instead
of
waiting
you
let
yourself
go
and
the
great
difficulty
is
to
know
how
to
let
yourself
go
far
enough
without
going
too
far
remember
that
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valour
but
do
not
confound
discretion
with
timidity
i
have
already
said
that
you
ought
to
be
able
and
willing
and
more
than
that
that
you
ought
to
make
it
your
object
to
encounter
every
sort
of
style
even
those
styles
which
are
hardly
worthy
or
to
be
quite
candid
are
quite
unworthy
of
the
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
such
styles
and
therefore
it
is
just
as
well
not
to
allow
their
exponents
to
become
conceited
or
to
imagine
that
by
any
chance
they
can
possibly
be
effective
it
is
important
for
the
prestige
of
fencing
that
those
who
have
no
knowledge
of
their
weapon
or
at
most
a
mere
smattering
should
not
be
allowed
to
suppose
that
they
can
depend
upon
mere
energy
and
a
blind
rush
to
defend
themselves
against
a
man
who
has
been
trained
to
the
skilful
handling
of
the
sword
confidence
that
mainest
mainstay
of
defence
ought
not
to
be
possible
for
the
ignorant
fencer
it
ought
to
be
the
peculiar
privilege
of
the
trained
and
scientific
expert
ii
to
come
back
to
the
various
situations
which
may
occur
in
the
assault
if
i
see
a
fencer
as
soon
as
he
falls
on
guard
engage
swords
and
at
once
hurriedly
let
fly
thrust
after
thrust
attack
following
attack
in
quick
succession
if
he
neglects
to
test
the
length
of
his
sword
by
gradually
feeling
his
way
by
employing
all
the
necessary
tactics
of
the
preliminary
skirmish
by
prospecting
for
information
and
discreetly
sounding
the
enemy
then
to
my
mind
he
may
be
classed
at
once
he
may
have
some
dexterity
a
certain
power
of
execution
but
by
the
mere
act
of
joining
blades
he
may
be
set
down
as
a
blind
fencer
far
more
truly
than
the
man
who
keeps
out
of
distance
and
chooses
the
proper
moment
at
one
time
to
refuse
at
another
when
least
expected
to
take
the
engagement
or
to
seize
his
opponent
blade
with
courage
and
resolution
i
suppose
remarked
the
comte
de
that
a
few
years
hence
it
is
highly
probable
that
a
new
set
of
theories
will
be
invented
to
supersede
these
modern
ideas
which
are
so
hotly
disputed
now
and
they
in
their
turn
will
be
considered
out
of
date
no
doubt
that
is
to
be
expected
in
the
nature
of
things
the
form
may
or
rather
certainly
will
change
but
the
substance
will
be
unaltered
let
me
submit
evidence
to
prove
it
i
mentioned
the
other
day
some
old
books
on
which
i
hoped
to
look
through
i
will
only
refer
to
them
for
one
moment
i
managed
to
read
them
all
and
dreary
reading
it
was
but
i
got
through
them
being
supported
by
a
conscientious
sense
of
duty
and
i
unearthed
among
others
the
two
following
passages
the
first
on
the
subject
of
was
written
in
the
seventeenth
century
that
is
to
say
it
is
about
two
hundred
years
old
reason
why
you
must
make
your
steps
of
unequal
measure
is
that
thereby
you
always
hold
your
adversary
in
suspense
and
uncertain
what
you
would
be
at
for
if
you
always
go
about
your
business
of
a
set
way
and
with
a
set
regularity
of
step
it
may
happen
that
the
enemy
will
make
his
reckoning
so
exactly
that
he
can
direct
his
sword
not
only
at
the
place
where
he
sees
you
to
be
but
even
at
that
place
to
which
he
knows
you
will
presently
come
whereof
by
this
means
he
is
hindered
one
might
suppose
that
this
was
written
yesterday
could
any
professor
however
skilful
put
the
point
better
or
more
logically
the
weapons
however
were
very
different
from
ours
heavy
cut
and
thrust
rapiers
wielded
sometimes
in
one
hand
sometimes
in
both
but
the
laws
of
judgment
caution
and
strategy
were
the
same
and
will
be
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
to
prove
once
more
that
this
new
school
which
a
few
years
since
was
received
with
a
howl
of
abuse
really
did
not
advance
such
very
extravagant
doctrines
and
that
the
power
of
eye
which
we
were
discussing
yesterday
is
intimately
connected
with
the
power
of
touch
i
have
made
a
note
of
these
other
few
lines
still
on
the
subject
of
attacks
follows
that
the
great
gain
that
science
gives
is
security
in
making
your
approaches
which
can
not
be
obtained
except
you
thoroughly
comprehend
the
importance
both
of
touch
and
eye
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
bodily
activity
and
readiness
of
hand
are
alike
as
nothing
when
weighed
against
a
good
approach
and
we
are
reluctantly
obliged
to
admit
that
after
all
our
original
ideas
have
been
anticipated
and
we
stand
convicted
of
plagiarism
i
might
revenge
myself
for
the
trouble
i
have
taken
to
ransack
these
ancient
folios
by
inflicting
upon
you
any
number
of
quotations
but
i
will
be
merciful
and
am
content
to
have
demonstrated
that
the
ideas
that
are
supposed
to
be
most
radical
are
often
when
they
come
to
be
examined
most
truly
conservative
iii
i
have
another
question
for
you
continued
the
comte
de
you
were
speaking
the
other
day
of
feints
and
stop
thrusts
of
course
it
was
ridiculous
to
expect
an
opponent
to
follow
every
gyration
which
you
chose
to
describe
with
the
point
of
your
sword
but
do
you
think
that
nowadays
the
practice
of
straightening
the
arm
on
every
possible
occasion
is
utterly
overdone
no
doubt
it
is
by
some
men
overdone
or
rather
very
badly
done
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
quid
you
know
is
a
good
motto
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
however
little
you
may
like
it
that
this
movement
which
comes
more
by
instinct
than
by
intention
is
now
the
refuge
of
those
who
can
not
parry
but
mind
this
it
is
a
refuge
from
which
it
is
often
very
difficult
to
dislodge
them
i
quite
admit
that
those
who
straighten
the
arm
without
any
justification
are
hopelessly
unscientific
but
they
present
a
difficulty
to
surmount
which
requires
serious
attention
let
me
explain
before
going
on
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
stop
thrusts
and
time
thrusts
the
stop
thrust
is
taken
when
your
opponent
advances
incautiously
or
when
he
draws
back
his
arm
while
executing
a
complicated
attack
whenever
in
fact
he
makes
a
movement
which
leaves
him
exposed
the
time
thrust
on
the
other
hand
correctly
speaking
is
a
parry
of
opposition
the
most
dangerous
of
all
parries
for
if
it
fails
it
leaves
you
absolutely
exposed
and
at
the
mercy
of
your
opponent
i
have
seen
it
taught
in
the
lesson
by
every
master
as
an
exercise
no
doubt
but
i
have
hardly
ever
seen
a
master
put
it
into
practice
in
the
assault
the
thrust
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
but
on
the
contrary
it
is
to
be
condemned
on
many
grounds
i
should
like
to
see
it
ignominiously
expelled
from
the
fencing
room
as
the
buyers
and
sellers
were
expelled
from
the
temple
iv
do
you
follow
the
distinction
a
time
thrust
is
taken
on
the
final
movement
of
an
attack
when
you
think
you
know
exactly
what
is
coming
and
can
judge
with
certainty
in
what
line
the
point
will
be
delivered
very
well
then
parry
instead
of
timing
for
if
you
are
wrong
and
who
is
not
sometimes
you
can
at
any
rate
have
recourse
to
another
parry
whereas
the
time
thrust
when
misjudged
results
in
a
mutual
hit
and
for
one
that
is
good
tender
how
much
base
metal
you
will
put
into
circulation
the
stop
thrust
which
is
taken
as
i
have
said
on
the
opponent
advance
is
less
dangerous
therefore
never
attack
a
man
who
straightens
his
arm
on
every
occasion
without
making
sure
of
his
blade
and
you
need
have
no
fear
of
the
result
it
is
quite
true
that
the
practice
of
straightening
the
arm
is
much
more
prevalent
than
it
used
to
be
simply
because
this
style
of
play
which
is
of
great
antiquity
had
gone
out
of
fashion
and
given
place
to
another
method
which
in
its
turn
was
overdone
the
method
of
feints
and
flourishes
so
too
the
trick
of
reversing
the
lunge
by
throwing
back
the
left
foot
and
dropping
the
body
to
allow
the
attack
to
pass
over
your
head
is
not
an
invention
of
the
school
as
it
has
been
ridiculously
christened
it
is
an
old
trick
a
ruse
of
great
antiquity
which
may
or
at
all
events
ought
to
be
found
in
homer
still
unless
your
opponent
drives
you
to
it
by
wild
and
frantic
rushes
it
is
a
stroke
to
be
used
sparingly
and
with
the
object
of
letting
him
know
that
you
are
ready
to
receive
him
by
this
means
you
will
stop
him
from
rushing
at
you
on
every
possible
occasion
i
like
to
see
a
stop
thrust
correctly
taken
always
provided
that
i
do
not
see
others
in
the
course
of
the
same
assault
taken
incorrectly
for
then
it
is
obvious
that
the
correct
thrust
was
a
simple
fluke
i
am
speaking
now
from
the
scientific
standpoint
perhaps
i
can
put
my
point
more
clearly
if
my
opponent
says
do
profess
to
be
scientific
i
simply
defend
myself
by
the
light
of
nature
he
may
do
what
he
likes
i
shall
not
complain
of
his
mistakes
he
is
perfectly
within
his
rights
and
knows
no
better
but
the
expert
fencer
has
no
business
to
make
mistakes
or
at
least
he
should
try
to
avoid
them
as
far
as
he
can
even
at
the
risk
of
being
lynched
for
my
unorthodox
opinions
i
should
venture
to
say
to
the
fencer
all
things
make
yourself
dangerous
be
difficult
fencer
since
that
is
the
stereotyped
phrase
without
it
there
is
no
salvation
your
guns
are
not
shotted
your
performance
is
mere
but
be
careful
not
to
give
these
words
a
wider
application
than
they
are
meant
to
carry
all
that
i
would
say
is
this
that
you
are
to
follow
your
natural
instinct
to
trust
your
impulse
to
be
yourself
and
not
your
master
puppet
i
do
not
mean
to
propound
an
acrobatic
theory
of
fencing
or
to
recommend
a
meaningless
objectless
indiscriminate
charging
about
like
the
convulsive
struggles
of
a
wild
beast
that
has
received
its
death
wound
it
would
be
as
wrong
to
take
such
extravagant
exceptions
for
your
model
as
it
would
be
unfair
to
argue
from
them
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
futility
of
the
new
school
no
doubt
fencers
of
this
kind
they
call
themselves
fencers
may
score
an
occasional
hit
for
as
i
have
had
occasion
to
remark
already
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
luck
in
fencing
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
fencing
it
is
much
more
like
mere
brutal
fisticuffs
such
eccentric
methods
are
of
no
importance
they
are
not
based
on
any
sort
of
principle
but
are
the
mere
outcome
of
ignorance
they
belong
to
no
school
and
have
no
permanent
value
but
it
does
not
do
to
despise
an
unbeaten
enemy
therefore
confront
these
methods
and
defeat
them
first
you
can
afford
to
despise
them
afterwards
quite
so
exclaimed
monsieur
de
that
is
exactly
my
opinion
one
moment
i
said
i
have
not
quite
done
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
have
very
little
faith
in
the
stories
one
hears
of
the
regimental
fencing
master
being
run
through
by
the
recruit
such
an
event
may
happen
just
as
a
may
fall
on
your
head
when
you
are
walking
in
the
street
but
i
fancy
that
if
you
were
to
apply
the
rule
of
three
to
all
the
cases
the
result
would
not
exactly
support
the
paradox
there
is
a
class
of
fencers
who
are
thoroughly
in
fact
too
thoroughly
convinced
that
they
are
very
dangerous
fellows
and
that
they
are
never
hit
you
repeatedly
come
across
this
sort
of
thing
in
the
fencing
room
your
opponent
delivers
an
attack
which
you
parry
he
stays
on
the
lunge
doubled
up
with
his
body
dropped
forward
your
riposte
lands
perhaps
in
his
mask
perhaps
in
his
back
or
arm
thereupon
he
recovers
and
remarks
with
a
negligent
air
in
the
mask
in
the
back
only
as
the
case
may
be
oh
only
in
the
mask
but
sir
the
point
would
have
run
you
through
the
head
and
traversed
your
brain
in
fact
it
would
have
been
quite
as
effective
as
a
hit
in
the
chest
which
penetrated
your
lungs
the
other
would
have
gone
six
inches
into
your
back
while
the
third
would
have
pierced
your
arm
and
run
you
through
the
chest
afterwards
you
offer
your
head
back
or
arm
instead
of
your
chest
i
hit
the
part
exposed
and
am
quite
satisfied
you
can
not
evade
or
parry
a
thrust
by
substituting
for
the
part
that
would
otherwise
be
hit
some
other
part
which
you
do
not
attempt
to
cover
all
that
you
do
is
to
offer
an
exchange
vi
do
you
suppose
that
these
fencers
would
pursue
the
same
tactics
if
they
had
to
face
a
naked
point
instead
of
the
button
of
a
foil
and
that
they
would
fancy
themselves
out
of
danger
if
they
laid
themselves
open
to
be
run
through
the
head
or
back
or
neck
such
wounds
are
not
trivial
and
can
not
be
ignored
a
sharp
point
is
a
peremptory
fact
which
makes
short
work
of
illusions
or
again
do
you
imagine
that
anyone
would
be
very
anxious
in
a
real
fight
to
run
the
risk
of
double
hits
by
which
he
might
succeed
in
inflicting
a
serious
wound
but
only
at
the
expense
of
being
run
through
the
body
himself
no
one
would
resort
to
such
desperate
measures
as
these
unless
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
left
to
be
done
this
is
so
thoroughly
true
that
if
you
set
two
men
to
fight
in
a
with
blunt
swords
you
notice
at
once
that
the
assault
is
something
very
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
with
mere
foils
you
might
almost
fancy
that
the
swords
though
they
can
no
longer
wound
are
still
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
mortal
combat
and
retain
some
reminiscence
of
the
real
thing
of
naked
chest
opposed
to
naked
steel
there
is
none
of
that
brilliant
dash
none
of
those
brilliant
strokes
that
are
usually
more
conspicuous
for
temerity
than
judgment
the
fight
is
a
sham
fight
still
but
the
players
can
not
help
taking
it
seriously
each
is
saying
to
himself
let
me
see
what
would
happen
if
we
were
in
earnest
the
different
shape
of
the
hilt
the
harsh
grating
of
the
steel
affect
the
imagination
that
fellow
see
what
he
is
up
to
make
him
keep
his
distance
give
him
something
to
think
about
that
is
the
sort
of
caution
that
the
swords
are
whispering
you
may
easily
satisfy
yourselves
of
the
truth
of
my
remarks
the
next
time
you
have
an
opportunity
of
watching
a
bout
of
this
sort
and
if
there
is
so
great
a
difference
between
simple
foils
and
blunt
swords
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
difference
between
blunt
swords
and
sharp
is
far
greater
wild
play
subsides
and
those
who
were
willing
to
charge
blindly
when
they
risked
nothing
more
than
a
dent
in
a
leather
jacket
prefer
to
study
ways
and
means
a
little
more
closely
it
is
a
very
natural
prompting
of
the
instinct
the
rule
is
almost
universal
but
there
are
occasional
exceptions
which
you
may
be
called
upon
to
face
and
if
you
do
not
want
to
be
taken
by
surprise
you
had
better
make
yourself
acquainted
with
them
beforehand
for
what
they
are
worth
then
you
approve
said
de
of
occasional
practice
with
muffled
swords
not
only
of
occasional
but
of
constant
practice
and
that
not
in
the
assault
only
but
in
the
lesson
too
the
greater
weight
of
the
sword
and
the
wider
blade
which
is
straight
and
less
whippy
than
the
foil
steady
the
hand
keep
it
in
position
and
give
a
truer
aim
vii
i
notice
observed
one
of
my
friends
that
you
have
said
nothing
about
fencers
no
i
answered
the
fact
is
there
is
hardly
anything
to
say
and
even
the
which
do
not
usually
err
on
the
side
of
brevity
devote
very
little
space
to
them
for
there
is
really
no
particular
rule
which
applies
to
them
exclusively
but
surely
they
are
very
difficult
yes
in
a
way
no
doubt
they
are
though
one
of
my
friends
a
of
course
used
to
say
that
the
supposed
difficulty
is
only
a
convenient
excuse
invented
by
fencers
his
suggestion
is
more
witty
than
true
and
i
am
willing
to
allow
without
hesitation
that
really
are
puzzling
to
those
who
are
not
accustomed
to
fence
with
them
their
only
real
advantage
is
that
they
have
more
opportunities
of
fencing
against
than
have
of
fencing
against
them
when
once
you
are
used
to
them
the
difficulty
vanishes
the
on
the
contrary
when
it
comes
to
fighting
is
never
rid
of
the
far
graver
risk
which
he
takes
by
exposing
his
left
side
i
may
add
that
the
advantage
which
consists
entirely
in
his
incognito
would
exist
no
longer
if
the
professors
who
i
hope
may
take
the
hint
would
make
a
practice
of
giving
lessons
occasionally
with
the
left
hand
some
of
them
do
so
already
and
i
congratulate
them
on
their
good
sense
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
not
a
single
thrust
or
parry
which
can
not
be
equally
well
executed
by
a
player
only
from
want
of
practice
the
latter
finds
it
more
difficult
to
direct
his
point
because
the
lines
are
reversed
becomes
and
vice
versa
the
prefers
to
take
the
inside
engagement
that
is
to
say
this
line
suits
him
better
and
accordingly
it
is
good
policy
not
to
let
him
take
it
without
a
struggle
it
is
usually
more
difficult
to
hit
him
in
the
outside
line
so
much
for
general
principles
for
of
course
play
varies
as
much
as
although
the
contrary
is
sometimes
maintained
but
if
all
were
providentially
made
alike
one
would
think
that
it
could
not
be
very
difficult
to
get
to
know
the
pattern
by
heart
viii
well
you
must
admit
that
in
the
course
of
my
remarks
i
try
not
to
pass
over
anything
that
is
likely
to
interest
those
who
have
or
those
who
should
could
or
would
have
a
fancy
for
my
object
is
to
bring
out
the
essential
features
in
clear
relief
and
i
intentionally
omit
the
thousand
and
one
minute
details
which
would
overcrowd
my
canvas
and
prevent
you
from
properly
appreciating
the
leading
features
these
refinements
which
come
with
experience
and
habit
can
not
be
forced
they
must
be
slowly
acquired
by
the
friction
of
the
blades
by
meeting
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
fencers
by
facing
the
unforeseen
and
sudden
perils
which
confront
you
just
when
they
are
least
expected
you
know
how
awkward
a
young
fellow
is
when
he
makes
his
first
appearance
in
society
when
he
finds
himself
in
a
he
is
shy
and
uncomfortable
he
does
not
know
how
to
sit
down
or
how
to
stand
up
or
how
to
talk
but
presently
without
consulting
any
professor
simply
so
to
speak
by
the
daily
friction
of
his
common
intercourse
with
other
people
older
and
more
experienced
than
himself
he
acquires
confidence
ease
address
manners
and
so
forth
it
is
just
the
same
with
fencers
craft
finesse
tact
and
judgment
come
by
degrees
as
wings
grow
out
of
feathers
but
do
not
forget
that
the
lesson
and
the
master
pad
are
your
first
instructors
and
must
not
be
neglected
to
neglect
them
would
be
ungrateful
and
ingratitude
is
always
base
besides
you
can
not
afford
it
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
else
i
can
find
to
say
i
shall
be
in
a
difficulty
unless
you
promise
to
help
me
out

the
seventh

i
well
what
is
your
text
asked
my
host
as
he
joined
the
group
which
had
met
as
usual
in
the
oh
i
replied
i
have
nothing
left
to
preach
about
and
i
said
the
marquis
de
who
was
looking
through
the
evening
paper
do
mean
to
let
you
off
so
easily
here
is
a
piece
of
news
which
is
very
interesting
in
connection
with
our
nightly
symposia
read
it
read
it
exclaimed
a
chorus
of
voices
the
marquis
read
out
the
following
paragraph
unfortunate
encounter
recently
took
place
in
the
papal
states
between
the
young
marquis
de
monte
and
the
chevalier
the
duel
arose
out
of
a
very
singular
incident
the
chevalier
a
neapolitan
has
the
reputation
of
a
that
is
to
say
he
is
supposed
to
have
the
evil
eye
the
marquis
de
monte
happening
to
meet
him
in
a
took
up
without
thinking
a
little
coral
hand
a
charm
that
he
was
wearing
on
his
and
pointed
it
at
the
chevalier
as
he
was
passing
close
by
him
the
chevalier
who
knew
what
people
thought
of
him
noticed
the
movement
and
called
the
young
marquis
out
they
met
the
following
morning
and
the
unfortunate
marquis
received
a
sword
thrust
in
the
chest
and
was
killed
outright
the
chevalier
besides
being
a
very
expert
swordsman
is
said
to
have
acquired
a
knowledge
of
several
secret
thrusts
ii
the
reading
of
this
paragraph
was
followed
by
a
momentary
silence
then
someone
remarked
i
have
often
heard
thrusts
spoken
of
but
how
is
it
that
they
are
not
taught
by
the
professors
well
i
said
smiling
for
one
sufficient
reason
that
if
they
were
taught
they
would
no
longer
be
secret
but
joking
apart
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
my
belief
in
secret
thrusts
is
about
equal
to
my
belief
in
ghosts
come
this
must
be
looked
into
i
believe
in
out
of
the
way
and
unlooked
for
strokes
but
further
than
that
i
can
not
go
yet
surely
they
must
have
existed
some
time
or
other
objected
my
critic
or
how
did
they
come
by
their
name
oh
they
existed
more
or
less
at
one
time
or
perhaps
it
would
be
nearer
the
mark
to
say
that
they
were
supposed
to
exist
they
are
a
shadowy
survival
a
sort
of
family
ghost
that
we
have
inherited
from
the
italian
school
for
french
fencing
though
it
has
developed
characteristic
features
of
its
own
traces
its
descent
as
you
know
in
a
direct
line
from
italian
ancestry
secret
thrusts
died
and
were
buried
when
science
was
in
its
infancy
and
science
has
since
grown
up
in
other
conditions
and
grown
strong
by
working
on
other
lines
they
could
not
be
revived
unless
the
attendant
ritual
of
an
effete
tradition
the
system
of
a
bygone
age
long
since
forgotten
were
revived
along
with
them
at
the
present
day
with
our
modern
weapons
and
our
modern
methods
to
use
a
secret
thrust
would
amount
almost
to
a
crime
and
if
it
were
not
exactly
that
if
a
charge
of
murder
or
manslaughter
would
not
lie
it
certainly
would
be
considered
iniquitous
by
all
honourable
men
no
one
with
a
conscience
could
conceivably
buy
success
in
an
affair
of
honour
at
such
a
price
iii
before
we
leave
this
question
i
should
like
to
make
my
meaning
perfectly
clear
in
the
world
as
we
find
it
there
are
some
things
for
which
no
definite
penalty
is
prescribed
things
that
do
not
bring
a
man
within
the
law
but
that
are
none
the
less
offences
in
the
court
of
conscience
and
very
properly
censured
an
action
such
as
we
are
now
discussing
is
to
my
mind
a
case
in
point
always
supposing
it
to
be
a
possible
action
but
is
it
possible
that
is
the
question
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
a
man
who
is
compelled
by
force
of
circumstances
to
fight
a
duel
your
success
if
you
do
succeed
may
be
due
to
the
blessing
of
providence
to
skill
or
to
accident
but
it
must
satisfy
one
condition
it
must
be
unequivocal
you
are
meeting
an
honourable
enemy
in
an
honourable
fight
and
obviously
the
means
you
employ
must
be
beyond
all
question
and
not
devices
so
crooked
as
almost
to
deserve
the
epithet
i
found
myself
speaking
with
some
warmth
and
was
pleased
to
see
that
my
remarks
were
received
with
great
interest
of
course
i
continued
in
speaking
or
writing
on
a
subject
of
this
sort
one
can
only
express
a
strictly
personal
opinion
now
what
do
you
say
we
have
been
let
in
for
this
duel
by
an
evening
paper
shall
we
drop
it
or
shall
we
see
it
through
i
was
answered
by
a
general
cry
go
on
i
am
afraid
it
may
take
us
rather
far
afield
for
it
involves
important
considerations
so
much
the
better
observed
my
host
we
have
plenty
of
cigars
and
the
night
is
young
we
provided
ourselves
with
fresh
cigars
to
follow
those
already
alight
and
settled
down
in
our
and
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
iv
well
i
began
hitherto
we
have
had
in
view
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
theoretical
fencing
fencing
regarded
as
a
sport
as
a
bout
with
the
foils
in
a
fencing
room
we
shall
now
have
to
consider
it
from
the
strictly
utilitarian
standpoint
in
the
one
case
we
have
an
assault
consisting
of
a
succession
of
fancy
strokes
played
by
connoisseurs
who
in
point
of
skill
may
of
course
be
equally
or
unequally
matched
but
who
nevertheless
play
the
game
on
the
whole
in
accordance
with
principles
that
are
tolerably
well
ascertained
in
the
other
case
we
have
a
serious
encounter
with
swords
sharply
pointed
flashing
in
the
sun
and
dangerous
to
life
the
first
hit
correct
or
incorrect
is
decisive
no
matter
how
it
is
delivered
no
matter
where
do
not
forget
that
you
have
to
reckon
not
only
with
skill
but
with
the
possibility
of
surprise
not
only
with
subtlety
but
with
brute
force
not
only
with
science
but
with
blind
and
headlong
ignorance
your
opponent
does
not
greatly
care
whether
he
lets
your
blood
in
orthodox
style
or
whether
he
operates
on
your
face
for
instance
or
on
those
parts
of
the
body
that
are
too
much
neglected
in
the
fencing
room
you
do
not
choose
your
opponent
he
is
chosen
for
you
by
accident
he
may
be
tall
or
short
strong
or
weak
you
are
no
longer
engaged
in
a
sport
in
which
your
object
is
to
play
correctly
in
a
contest
of
skill
in
which
you
may
perhaps
allow
yourself
to
be
hit
occasionally
in
order
to
lead
your
opponent
on
and
afterwards
defeat
him
more
easily
the
man
who
confronts
you
with
that
threatening
point
may
be
an
artistic
and
accomplished
swordsman
but
he
may
equally
well
never
have
touched
a
sword
in
his
life
and
be
trusting
to
luck
or
to
his
general
smartness
or
to
a
cool
head
you
may
find
that
you
have
to
do
with
an
enemy
whose
every
movement
is
studied
who
keeps
his
distance
cleverly
who
never
advances
or
retires
without
a
reason
or
on
the
contrary
it
may
turn
out
that
your
opponent
trusting
to
one
supreme
effort
of
audacity
in
defiance
of
all
calculation
and
throwing
to
the
wind
every
shred
of
theory
will
make
such
brutal
use
of
his
sword
as
the
primitive
and
untutored
instinct
of
dictates
we
realise
at
once
how
far
we
have
got
from
the
harmless
diversion
of
the
assault
the
sham
fight
conducted
under
the
master
eye
on
strictly
correct
principles
and
with
inoffensive
weapons
the
assault
and
the
duel
are
even
further
apart
than
the
assault
and
the
formal
lesson
in
short
this
newspaper
paragraph
has
brought
us
face
to
face
with
the
real
duel
and
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
discuss
it
in
all
its
bearings
so
we
had
better
begin
at
the
beginning
unfortunately
one
always
finds
that
it
is
impossible
to
discuss
the
art
of
fence
without
coming
to
the
duel
for
say
what
you
will
cases
must
sometimes
occur
when
an
affront
for
which
the
law
offers
no
redress
compels
you
to
go
out
duel
as
someone
puts
it
can
not
be
suppressed
it
is
like
a
bad
neighbour
with
whom
we
have
to
live
on
the
best
terms
we
can
some
years
ago
i
happened
to
read
a
great
deal
of
fencing
literature
the
various
authors
though
not
one
of
them
could
find
a
good
word
to
say
for
duelling
contrived
between
them
to
fill
in
a
sketch
of
its
rise
and
progress
from
the
earliest
times
down
to
the
present
day
this
is
evidently
one
of
the
points
where
the
civilised
man
and
the
savage
meet
on
common
ground
and
is
an
instance
of
the
law
that
civilisation
modifies
refines
perhaps
transforms
our
instincts
dresses
or
disguises
them
in
the
latest
fashion
but
never
gets
rid
of
them
at
one
time
the
duel
was
called
trial
by
battle
or
simply
the
judicial
combat
then
it
was
pronounced
illegal
and
those
who
fought
in
a
private
quarrel
were
sentenced
either
to
death
or
to
long
and
cruel
periods
of
imprisonment
at
a
later
period
growing
insolent
with
impunity
the
duel
like
a
strayed
reveller
swaggered
in
the
streets
and
public
places
we
find
it
haunting
the
taverns
we
see
the
flicker
of
the
blades
under
a
street
lamp
drawn
for
a
word
for
a
ribbon
for
a
bet
for
anything
or
for
nothing
even
the
seconds
who
parted
good
friends
did
their
best
to
spit
each
other
next
morning
well
what
better
evidence
could
we
require
to
prove
that
this
last
resort
of
wounded
honour
is
somehow
deeply
rooted
in
human
nature
than
the
fact
that
the
ancient
and
honourable
practice
of
duelling
has
remained
the
final
court
of
appeal
in
spite
of
changed
surroundings
in
spite
of
hostile
opinion
and
in
spite
of
the
extravagant
follies
that
have
sometimes
disgraced
it
vi
but
this
is
a
digression
for
which
i
apologise
i
was
led
astray
by
my
subject
and
drifted
quite
unconsciously
into
an
unpremeditated
preface
do
apologise
said
de
your
digression
is
charming
and
besides
i
continued
you
know
i
have
a
sort
of
moral
claim
on
your
indulgence
for
i
might
have
displayed
my
erudition
and
have
quoted
names
and
dates
and
facts
unearthed
from
dusty
folios
and
yet
i
have
mercifully
spared
you
oh
thank
you
thank
you
came
from
several
when
one
talks
of
duelling
there
is
a
point
that
strikes
one
at
the
outset
and
though
it
is
not
directly
connected
with
it
is
too
nearly
allied
to
the
duel
to
be
dismissed
without
notice
i
mean
the
duties
of
seconds
i
shall
not
now
enter
upon
the
question
of
what
those
duties
may
be
before
the
combatants
meet
these
consist
in
pressing
for
moderate
counsels
in
acting
or
even
the
part
of
peacemaker
you
all
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
no
chance
of
arriving
at
an
honourable
settlement
should
be
neglected
before
allowing
your
men
to
go
out
what
should
we
think
of
the
man
who
could
forget
that
his
honour
and
his
friend
life
are
equally
committed
to
his
keeping
and
that
he
ought
not
out
of
a
quixotic
regard
for
the
one
to
jeopardise
the
other
needlessly
when
a
man
fights
his
conviction
that
right
is
on
his
side
is
everything
and
therefore
the
correct
attitude
of
a
second
is
that
of
a
man
who
acting
calmly
but
firmly
in
his
friend
interest
seeks
to
avoid
a
quarrel
any
other
attitude
is
not
only
incorrect
but
even
renders
him
liable
to
be
called
to
account
for
neglecting
his
bounden
duty
personally
if
after
exhausting
every
effort
to
obtain
a
friendly
settlement
i
found
that
a
meeting
was
unavoidable
although
i
was
thoroughly
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
that
it
was
a
case
not
of
injured
honour
but
only
of
injured
vanity
or
of
wounded
pride
i
should
not
hesitate
to
withdraw
duels
played
to
the
gallery
are
either
odious
or
absurd
they
are
out
of
date
and
should
be
numbered
with
the
obsolete
fashions
of
the
past
vii
they
arose
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
a
flamboyant
era
when
everyone
carried
a
sword
and
it
was
considered
the
right
thing
to
air
it
on
every
opportunity
in
order
to
fill
up
the
time
which
might
otherwise
have
passed
somewhat
heavily
every
age
has
its
fashions
and
its
vices
its
childish
toys
and
favourite
follies
those
gallant
blades
that
cut
such
a
tremendous
figure
in
the
old
days
would
meet
with
a
very
poor
reception
now
if
they
could
revisit
the
scenes
of
their
dashing
exploits
but
if
it
is
the
duty
of
a
second
to
play
the
part
of
mediator
before
the
action
it
is
equally
his
duty
to
be
cool
and
collected
on
the
ground
his
personal
responsibility
is
increased
but
otherwise
his
rôle
remains
unchanged
it
then
becomes
imperative
on
him
to
anticipate
and
allow
for
every
contingency
he
must
let
nothing
escape
him
and
must
give
the
closest
attention
to
the
minutest
detail
in
order
that
his
principal
may
be
relieved
of
all
anxiety
and
may
preserve
that
cool
presence
of
mind
which
is
so
absolutely
indispensable
viii
in
short
the
fact
that
has
to
be
grasped
is
simply
this
that
not
one
of
the
thousand
and
one
preliminary
details
is
unimportant
and
that
things
seemingly
the
most
trivial
may
suddenly
assume
the
most
unexpected
gravity
the
stake
is
too
high
to
justify
any
man
in
gambling
it
away
with
a
light
heart
in
the
first
place
the
selection
of
the
ground
must
be
carefully
considered
the
surface
should
be
smooth
and
even
without
dips
or
inequalities
that
can
be
in
the
slightest
degree
dangerous
be
particular
to
avoid
a
spot
where
there
is
any
grass
grass
is
slippery
and
may
imperil
your
friend
life
here
is
another
point
worth
remembering
run
your
eye
quickly
but
carefully
over
the
ground
where
your
friend
will
stand
he
is
very
likely
to
neglect
this
precaution
himself
and
may
fail
to
see
a
root
for
instance
almost
unnoticeable
to
a
careless
glance
which
might
very
easily
trip
him
up
or
throw
him
off
his
guard
at
a
critical
moment
when
it
was
too
late
to
stay
the
impetus
of
his
point
all
this
no
doubt
seems
extremely
trivial
but
how
do
you
know
that
the
tuft
of
wet
slippery
grass
the
half
hidden
root
or
treacherous
stone
will
not
turn
the
scale
a
moment
later
the
contending
parties
it
has
been
said
are
entitled
to
a
fair
division
of
light
and
ground
if
that
is
so
you
will
be
well
advised
not
to
stand
out
for
your
share
of
light
and
you
should
never
consent
to
let
your
principal
face
the
sun
the
glitter
of
the
blades
confuses
the
eye
and
causes
hesitation
remember
that
in
fighting
the
eye
is
an
implement
at
least
as
important
as
the
sword
seeing
in
this
case
is
thinking
the
eye
warns
you
of
danger
and
instinctively
picks
out
the
enemy
weak
spot
and
more
than
that
a
steady
eye
an
eye
that
looks
one
in
the
face
unflinchingly
overawes
and
fascinates
while
the
sword
threatens
the
spying
questioning
eye
is
the
intelligent
scout
again
never
allow
the
combatants
to
strip
the
impression
of
the
cold
air
on
the
bare
skin
and
the
unaccustomed
exposure
may
affect
one
more
than
the
other
if
he
is
naturally
more
sensitive
even
though
he
may
be
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
but
objected
the
comte
de
what
if
the
other
side
insist
you
must
refuse
to
give
way
no
one
has
a
right
to
insist
upon
it
it
is
a
practice
usual
among
soldiers
and
does
not
hold
good
outside
the
ix
while
we
are
on
this
point
remarked
one
of
my
friends
there
are
two
questions
i
should
like
to
ask
you
i
will
do
my
best
to
answer
them
i
replied
for
as
my
lawyer
would
put
it
i
may
say
that
i
am
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
the
leading
cases
well
is
it
allowable
to
use
a
fencing
glove
it
is
usual
but
custom
is
not
always
right
and
though
many
men
suppose
that
they
are
entitled
to
it
as
a
matter
of
course
they
can
not
strictly
speaking
claim
it
generally
the
parties
agree
beforehand
whether
fencing
gloves
shall
be
used
or
not
it
nearly
always
happens
that
both
sides
prefer
to
use
them
for
with
the
help
of
a
fencing
glove
you
get
a
firmer
and
more
confident
grip
of
the
sword
and
are
less
likely
to
be
disarmed
besides
the
hilt
of
a
sword
is
hard
it
tires
and
bruises
the
hand
the
fingers
in
contact
with
it
are
jarred
at
every
parry
that
is
at
all
strong
or
whenever
the
blades
meet
sharply
on
these
grounds
fencing
gloves
are
generally
allowed
however
if
the
seconds
of
one
side
object
the
seconds
of
the
other
side
can
not
either
require
them
to
use
a
fencing
glove
or
claim
the
right
for
their
own
principal
for
instance
the
objection
may
be
raised
that
the
use
of
a
fencing
glove
is
familiar
to
a
man
accustomed
to
fencing
but
unfamiliar
and
of
no
value
to
one
who
has
never
fenced
true
this
objection
is
seldom
raised
because
as
i
pointed
out
just
now
the
man
who
is
not
used
to
fencing
is
of
all
men
the
one
who
finds
a
serious
difficulty
in
handling
the
rough
hilt
of
a
sword
and
who
has
everything
to
gain
by
using
a
padded
glove
in
any
case
you
are
at
liberty
to
wear
an
ordinary
leather
glove
whether
your
opponent
chooses
to
do
so
or
not
or
you
may
wrap
a
handkerchief
round
your
hand
to
give
you
a
firmer
grip
of
the
sword
provided
you
are
careful
not
to
leave
a
hanging
end
which
may
dangle
loose
and
hinder
the
action
of
your
opponent
point
x
i
will
now
put
my
second
question
continued
my
inquisitor
well
what
is
your
second
question
is
it
permissible
to
use
the
unarmed
hand
to
parry
and
put
aside
your
opponent
blade
oh
that
is
a
very
serious
matter
which
i
did
not
mean
to
pass
over
in
silence
but
it
involves
the
consideration
of
several
points
which
would
perhaps
take
us
too
far
suppose
we
leave
it
for
then
we
adjourn
until
said
the
comte
de
and
so
we
broke
up
illustration
the
eighth
evening
illustration
parry
with
the
i
you
asked
me
yesterday
if
it
is
allowable
to
use
the
unarmed
hand
to
parry
and
put
aside
the
sword
my
answer
is
very
emphatic
no
but
what
if
the
parties
agree
to
allow
it
beforehand
asked
the
marquis
de
r
that
is
an
agreement
which
in
my
opinion
ought
not
to
be
made
the
practice
is
wholly
foreign
to
our
ways
and
to
the
traditions
that
have
come
down
to
us
i
am
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
is
the
authority
of
a
very
profound
writer
the
comte
de
chatauvillard
who
has
many
strong
supporters
for
the
statement
that
parry
with
the
hand
may
be
a
matter
of
agreement
and
other
writers
among
whom
is
more
than
one
eminent
master
may
be
quoted
for
the
view
that
it
is
a
proper
matter
for
arrangement
between
the
contending
parties
that
does
not
affect
my
opinion
in
the
least
and
i
say
very
emphatically
and
very
distinctly
as
you
clearly
have
the
right
to
say
yes
or
no
say
no
invariably
such
a
concession
or
such
an
agreement
even
if
it
is
freely
entered
upon
by
both
sides
is
only
too
likely
to
lead
to
disastrous
and
fatal
mistakes
while
it
does
not
offer
any
counterbalancing
advantage
i
will
try
to
explain
why
the
parry
made
with
the
hand
that
does
not
hold
the
sword
goes
back
to
the
ancient
traditions
of
the
italian
school
to
the
methods
in
vogue
when
men
fought
with
sword
and
dagger
they
parried
and
attacked
with
either
weapon
indifferently
bringing
one
or
other
into
play
by
voltes
and
passes
which
have
been
dismissed
from
the
theory
and
practice
of
modern
fencing
the
art
which
was
adapted
in
those
days
to
the
double
means
of
offence
and
defence
employed
a
system
very
different
from
that
which
prevails
now
this
parry
or
to
speak
more
accurately
this
method
of
diverting
an
opponent
blade
which
was
done
with
either
hand
indifferently
was
reasonable
then
nowadays
it
would
be
a
fantastic
and
dangerous
anomaly
i
remember
trying
by
way
of
experiment
some
years
ago
at
naples
several
assaults
of
this
sort
with
an
italian
professor
named
the
poor
fellow
died
i
believe
in
prison
after
taking
part
in
one
of
the
many
revolutionary
attempts
that
were
made
to
wreck
the
kingdom
of
naples
parisi
used
to
come
regularly
to
my
house
where
i
had
furnished
a
room
for
fencing
i
wished
to
make
a
serious
study
of
italian
play
and
of
the
surviving
traditions
of
this
school
which
is
rapidly
disappearing
and
is
only
connected
with
its
past
by
a
few
almost
invisible
threads
well
parisi
used
to
fence
with
a
long
italian
sword
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
sort
of
stiletto
which
he
employed
to
parry
my
attacks
in
certain
lines
and
while
he
thus
stopped
my
attack
with
his
dagger
he
made
not
exactly
a
riposte
but
rather
a
simultaneous
on
me
with
his
sword
this
kind
of
play
which
continually
produced
new
and
difficult
situations
was
very
interesting
if
parisi
dropped
his
dagger
what
happened
his
left
hand
instead
of
following
my
blade
sprang
at
once
to
a
fixed
position
and
to
what
position
why
you
could
see
at
a
glance
by
the
way
he
carried
his
forearm
thrown
rather
high
across
his
chest
and
only
a
few
inches
away
from
it
that
he
was
ready
for
the
parry
with
the
hand
in
fact
doubly
ready
for
it
both
by
the
position
of
his
body
and
by
the
forward
position
of
his
left
arm
now
we
who
follow
the
rules
of
french
fencing
do
just
the
reverse
we
carry
our
left
arm
to
the
rear
and
so
leave
a
smaller
surface
exposed
to
our
opponent
point
we
therefore
can
not
bring
our
left
hand
into
play
without
abandoning
the
french
position
or
at
all
events
without
sacrificing
some
of
its
fundamental
principles
ii
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
first
took
up
fencing
i
have
been
in
all
the
i
have
fenced
with
many
professors
and
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
amateurs
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested
to
me
that
we
should
agree
to
parry
with
the
hand
i
have
never
no
not
once
in
all
the
assaults
that
i
have
witnessed
heard
such
a
suggestion
made
i
have
never
seen
this
kind
of
parry
employed
i
have
never
heard
of
a
master
showing
or
teaching
it
to
his
pupils
as
a
possible
case
or
even
as
a
highly
improbable
case
against
which
it
was
his
duty
as
a
wise
and
experienced
professor
to
put
on
their
guard
those
whose
instruction
was
committed
to
his
care
then
why
when
the
assault
ceases
to
be
an
exercise
or
an
amusement
why
when
you
stake
your
life
upon
the
issue
should
you
go
out
of
your
way
to
suggest
or
assent
to
something
foreign
to
all
recognised
practice
if
you
approve
of
the
surviving
methods
of
the
old
italian
school
you
should
admit
all
the
precepts
of
that
school
and
then
you
will
at
least
be
logical
your
sword
will
have
a
long
heavy
blade
broad
and
perfectly
rigid
the
hilt
will
be
surmounted
by
a
little
of
steel
on
which
you
will
place
your
fingers
and
to
which
you
will
attach
them
with
a
long
ribbon
incidentally
you
will
do
away
with
the
freedom
of
the
hand
the
supple
action
of
the
wrist
and
the
niceties
of
finger
play
you
will
have
to
make
frequent
use
of
parries
of
contraction
which
are
indispensable
to
italian
play
though
they
are
little
valued
not
to
say
altogether
ignored
by
the
french
school
you
must
learn
your
voltes
and
passes
the
manoeuvres
of
ducking
and
dodging
and
then
i
repeat
you
will
at
least
be
logical
but
an
agreement
which
recognises
only
one
of
these
practices
while
it
disregards
all
the
rest
seems
to
me
absurd
let
me
now
show
you
the
danger
which
can
hardly
be
avoided
of
admitting
this
parry
with
the
left
hand
between
the
open
palm
which
merely
brushes
the
blade
aside
and
the
hand
which
by
a
nervous
movement
closes
unconsciously
on
the
blade
and
holds
it
fast
the
difference
is
very
hard
to
seize
the
thing
is
done
in
a
moment
it
passes
like
a
flash
in
the
confusion
of
the
encounter
and
leaves
no
trace
behind
without
a
doubt
the
man
who
has
unconsciously
arrested
the
blade
instead
of
merely
turning
it
aside
will
be
in
despair
and
in
the
loyalty
of
his
heart
will
be
the
first
to
accuse
himself
but
if
his
point
has
taken
effect
if
he
has
delivered
a
fatal
thrust
will
his
despair
or
regret
or
any
heal
the
wound
that
he
has
inflicted
or
restore
the
life
that
he
has
taken
if
the
odds
were
a
thousand
to
one
against
a
fatal
issue
that
one
chance
would
be
enough
to
condemn
fatally
this
dangerous
agreement
moreover
i
may
remark
speaking
from
the
experience
that
is
obtained
by
long
familiarity
and
perhaps
from
some
small
skill
in
the
practice
of
arms
that
it
is
often
very
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
for
the
most
practised
eye
in
the
confusion
of
a
multitude
of
thrusts
swiftly
parried
and
as
swiftly
returned
to
follow
with
accuracy
the
course
of
two
swords
that
pass
to
and
fro
and
interlace
like
living
things
or
to
judge
with
indisputable
certainty
the
difference
between
these
two
movements
one
of
which
is
authorised
by
consent
while
the
other
may
suddenly
turn
an
honourable
fight
into
a
foul
assassination
the
mere
act
of
judging
so
bristles
with
difficulties
that
it
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
conflict
of
opinion
between
even
the
most
unbiassed
judges
who
can
decide
between
them
the
fact
on
which
their
judgment
is
based
is
there
no
longer
it
passed
in
a
moment
quick
as
thought
consider
the
terrible
position
in
which
you
are
placed
in
the
presence
of
a
man
lying
stretched
on
the
ground
before
you
cold
and
lifeless
who
ought
to
be
a
living
man
full
of
strength
and
vigour
and
now
i
appeal
to
all
seconds
in
the
name
of
good
sense
in
common
fairness
could
you
or
could
you
not
with
a
clear
conscience
take
the
heavy
responsibility
of
such
a
risk
iii
i
am
trying
you
see
to
obtain
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
manifold
duties
of
seconds
and
to
omit
none
of
the
minute
matters
of
detail
which
it
is
their
duty
to
attend
to
and
which
ought
to
be
present
to
their
minds
here
is
another
point
which
is
worthy
of
their
serious
attention
when
the
combatants
have
taken
sword
in
hand
and
the
blades
are
crossed
the
seconds
should
stand
within
reach
holding
a
sword
or
and
ready
to
stop
the
fight
should
any
irregularity
occur
or
if
either
of
the
men
should
slip
or
stumble
or
be
disarmed
or
wounded
this
last
case
especially
requires
their
utmost
vigilance
for
there
are
two
events
both
equally
disastrous
that
may
occur
suppose
one
of
the
men
is
wounded
in
the
natural
excitement
of
the
moment
the
man
who
has
delivered
the
thrust
is
often
unaware
that
his
point
has
taken
effect
before
he
can
tell
that
his
opponent
is
disabled
perhaps
before
he
can
check
himself
he
may
inflict
a
second
wound
unless
the
swords
are
instantly
knocked
up
the
wounded
man
on
the
other
hand
may
not
immediately
feel
the
effect
of
his
wound
and
by
continuing
to
fight
may
run
the
risk
of
being
wounded
a
second
time
and
that
more
seriously
it
may
also
happen
and
this
is
the
great
danger
that
in
a
fit
of
blind
rage
he
will
rush
madly
on
his
opponent
again
the
man
who
has
inflicted
a
wound
and
has
felt
his
point
go
home
instantly
and
instinctively
stays
his
hand
and
even
if
his
opponent
renews
the
attack
hesitates
to
strike
a
second
time
one
who
is
already
hurt
it
is
during
this
juncture
of
a
moment
pause
with
a
moment
hesitation
that
the
wounded
man
may
make
his
mad
rush
and
either
run
his
opponent
through
the
body
or
meet
his
own
destruction
if
his
opponent
has
promptly
recovered
his
guard
and
calmly
offers
him
his
point
iv
both
cases
are
alike
disastrous
for
either
may
lead
to
a
fatal
result
at
a
time
when
by
the
wound
already
received
the
fight
may
be
regarded
as
closed
or
at
least
as
suspended
the
seconds
who
by
redoubling
their
precautions
might
have
saved
the
useless
shedding
of
blood
will
of
course
be
held
to
blame
no
doubt
it
sometimes
happens
that
in
spite
of
the
closest
attention
the
attack
is
so
prompt
so
impetuous
so
swift
that
it
is
impossible
to
intervene
in
time
but
then
at
all
events
the
seconds
will
have
no
cause
for
fortunately
such
cases
are
of
very
rare
occurrence
but
they
do
sometimes
happen
and
it
is
therefore
very
necessary
for
the
seconds
to
watch
the
crossed
swords
incessantly
and
to
follow
their
every
movement
in
order
to
intervene
the
moment
that
one
of
the
men
is
wounded
however
slight
the
wound
may
seem
if
on
examination
the
wound
is
found
to
be
so
trivial
that
the
fight
can
continue
without
disadvantage
to
the
wounded
man
the
combatants
will
at
least
have
had
time
to
recover
their
coolness
and
this
close
attention
is
one
of
the
most
important
points
it
is
in
fact
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
here
is
the
seconds
real
difficulty
for
here
the
whole
responsibility
rests
with
them
i
have
still
several
things
to
say
of
which
you
will
recognise
the
importance
but
it
is
getting
late
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
postpone
them
to
our
next
meeting
illustration
the
ninth
evening
illustration
à
i
i
wish
remarked
the
comte
de
c
when
we
met
the
next
day
that
you
would
tell
us
what
you
think
of
the
à
in
the
duel
that
i
replied
is
the
very
thing
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
right
course
in
my
opinion
is
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
seconds
of
the
other
side
that
the
combatants
shall
be
separated
and
start
afresh
when
they
become
entangled
at
close
quarters
in
what
is
termed
a
à
otherwise
in
a
struggle
of
this
sort
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
may
happen
except
that
both
men
are
likely
to
receive
their
quietus
a
very
symmetrical
settling
of
their
accounts
by
the
process
of
double
entry
but
here
again
one
can
not
help
feeling
that
we
have
another
thorny
case
which
calls
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
with
due
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
and
fair
play
for
both
sides
if
one
of
the
men
makes
a
furious
rush
on
the
other
the
seconds
ought
not
to
knock
up
the
swords
until
the
man
who
has
stood
the
attack
has
delivered
his
riposte
for
he
has
gained
this
clear
advantage
that
after
stopping
the
rush
he
is
prepared
with
an
effective
rejoinder
and
this
advantage
he
is
clearly
entitled
to
use
many
questions
of
duelling
must
be
left
to
the
impartial
discretion
of
the
seconds
there
is
therefore
no
need
to
consider
what
would
happen
if
a
second
were
to
take
unfair
advantage
of
an
agreement
honourably
entered
into
on
both
sides
by
interfering
when
the
case
expressly
provided
for
had
not
arisen
well
but
suppose
such
a
thing
did
happen
why
then
your
conscience
must
tell
you
how
to
act
perhaps
you
might
interfere
summarily
to
stop
the
proceedings
if
the
nature
of
the
quarrel
allowed
it
or
you
might
call
upon
the
second
who
had
so
misconstrued
his
duty
to
withdraw
and
take
no
further
part
in
the
affair
i
have
often
heard
men
say
i
were
acting
second
in
an
affair
that
was
not
so
serious
as
to
warrant
a
fatal
issue
and
were
to
see
that
my
principal
was
about
to
be
run
through
the
body
by
a
thrust
that
would
certainly
be
fatal
i
should
not
hesitate
to
knock
up
the
swords
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
my
feelings
would
be
too
strong
for
me
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
should
i
be
very
far
wrong
yes
my
friend
you
would
be
absolutely
wrong
you
would
be
assuming
the
most
onerous
the
most
terrible
responsibility
and
your
action
though
dictated
by
a
praiseworthy
impulse
would
probably
cause
you
the
most
bitter
remorse
for
consider
you
have
arrested
the
sword
which
would
have
struck
one
of
the
opponents
full
in
the
body
the
fight
continues
and
the
man
whose
blow
you
intercepted
with
the
praiseworthy
motive
i
quite
admit
of
preventing
a
mortal
wound
is
himself
wounded
or
possibly
killed
fortune
which
favoured
him
at
the
outset
suddenly
turns
against
him
and
favours
his
opponent
perhaps
with
a
lucky
fluke
a
thing
which
no
foresight
can
prevent
what
would
your
feelings
be
when
you
saw
stretched
at
your
feet
a
man
whose
death
you
had
caused
by
exposing
him
to
a
danger
that
he
ought
never
to
have
encountered
a
duel
is
always
a
miserable
business
but
when
once
you
have
faithfully
and
energetically
done
all
that
you
can
to
prevent
it
you
must
leave
chance
to
decide
between
the
combatants
only
see
that
you
take
all
the
measures
that
are
in
your
power
to
minimise
the
chances
of
a
fatal
issue
it
seems
to
me
someone
remarked
that
if
when
a
friend
asks
you
to
oblige
him
with
your
services
one
were
to
think
of
all
these
innumerable
responsibilities
one
would
invariably
decline
to
act
i
do
know
whether
one
would
always
decline
but
i
know
very
well
that
the
second
part
is
one
of
unsparing
and
devotion
i
know
that
the
man
who
undertakes
it
lightly
can
not
be
too
severely
blamed
and
i
may
add
that
i
have
never
accepted
the
charge
without
passing
a
sleepless
night
haunted
by
the
most
gloomy
forebodings
the
second
who
conceives
that
he
is
merely
required
to
be
a
passive
witness
robs
the
part
of
all
its
meaning
all
its
value
all
its
dignity
you
remember
i
was
speaking
just
now
of
the
case
of
a
second
who
acting
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
instinctively
intercepts
a
blow
i
will
give
you
an
experience
of
my
own
i
was
once
acting
for
a
friend
in
an
affair
of
honour
i
was
thoroughly
on
the
alert
and
carefully
following
the
play
of
the
points
with
that
close
attention
and
perhaps
i
may
say
with
that
sureness
of
eye
which
one
acquires
from
some
familiarity
with
when
i
saw
the
opponent
point
coming
straight
at
my
friend
body
before
i
could
think
i
saw
in
an
instant
as
no
one
accustomed
to
fencing
could
fail
to
see
that
the
wound
would
be
mortal
i
knocked
up
the
swords
and
as
the
two
men
had
got
to
close
quarters
i
called
out
guard
but
i
had
hardly
done
so
when
i
realised
the
full
extent
of
my
unconsidered
action
and
i
felt
well
i
really
can
not
tell
you
what
my
feelings
were
at
that
moment
luckily
for
me
my
friend
who
was
no
less
clumsy
than
brave
was
not
the
man
to
leave
me
long
in
this
cruel
position
he
fell
a
few
seconds
later
seriously
wounded
the
simple
fact
is
that
where
so
many
considerations
have
to
be
taken
into
account
you
can
not
be
too
careful
never
to
go
a
step
beyond
the
limits
of
strict
and
unassailable
justice
in
fairness
to
yourself
and
to
everyone
else
concerned
ii
in
this
connection
i
am
reminded
of
another
case
which
not
unfrequently
occurs
and
on
which
i
have
sometimes
heard
the
most
contradictory
opinions
expressed
for
it
presents
a
really
difficult
problem
in
the
course
of
the
fight
one
of
the
antagonists
calls
for
a
halt
have
you
the
right
to
insist
that
the
fight
shall
continue
without
interruption
in
my
opinion
you
unquestionably
have
that
right
unless
the
case
has
been
already
provided
for
or
both
men
consent
still
surely
said
the
comte
de
c
in
a
prolonged
if
your
opponent
is
exhausted
if
he
is
so
done
that
he
can
hardly
hold
his
sword
if
he
is
blown
and
distressed
you
can
not
refuse
to
give
him
a
minute
or
two
to
recover
his
wind
well
i
replied
i
have
stated
what
i
believe
to
be
the
rights
of
the
case
on
which
either
combatant
can
fairly
insist
i
will
now
give
you
my
reasons
your
opponent
you
say
is
done
well
perhaps
he
may
be
but
have
you
considered
why
is
not
his
fatigue
due
to
the
violence
and
the
excessive
energy
with
which
he
began
the
fight
to
the
regardless
eagerness
with
which
he
has
assailed
you
without
consulting
his
staying
powers
or
husbanding
his
strength
you
have
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
all
this
fury
you
have
sustained
incessant
attacks
but
you
with
more
skill
have
economised
your
resources
and
have
bided
your
time
to
attack
him
that
opportune
moment
evidently
comes
just
when
your
opponent
exhausted
by
the
failure
of
his
repeated
attacks
is
likely
to
offer
you
the
least
resistance
then
what
happens
he
calls
for
a
halt
and
are
you
to
let
him
off
without
pressing
the
advantage
that
you
with
your
judgment
and
have
held
in
reserve
are
you
to
give
him
leave
to
recover
his
wind
that
is
to
say
to
recover
his
strength
and
rally
his
scattered
forces
in
order
that
he
may
start
afresh
to
make
a
second
onset
with
the
same
ardour
and
the
same
violence
as
before
the
danger
that
you
have
safely
encountered
once
may
prove
too
much
for
you
the
second
time
how
does
that
strike
you
surely
it
is
as
though
a
man
engaged
in
a
duel
with
pistols
in
which
each
party
is
at
liberty
to
fire
when
he
chooses
were
to
be
in
too
great
hurry
to
let
fly
at
his
opponent
and
then
when
his
barrels
were
emptied
and
useless
were
to
ask
permission
to
reload
before
he
has
received
his
opponent
fire
iii
situations
requiring
nerve
and
undoubtedly
occur
in
a
duel
with
pistols
but
similar
situations
more
trying
and
more
critical
occur
in
a
duel
with
swords
you
are
willing
to
admit
them
in
the
one
case
yet
you
refuse
to
admit
them
in
the
other
but
after
all
persisted
my
critic
you
can
hardly
strike
a
man
who
is
so
utterly
done
that
he
can
hardly
keep
his
point
up
quite
true
but
do
you
feel
that
hesitation
when
you
raise
your
pistol
to
fire
on
a
man
who
has
emptied
his
barrels
do
you
not
say
and
with
perfect
justice
have
stood
his
fire
it
is
his
turn
now
to
stand
mine
yet
the
cases
are
strictly
parallel
in
each
case
you
have
taken
the
risk
and
have
escaped
unhurt
and
the
empty
pistol
in
your
opponent
hand
is
more
completely
spent
than
a
sword
in
a
hand
that
is
nerveless
from
fatigue
for
no
power
can
recharge
the
pistol
with
the
ball
that
has
sped
but
on
the
contrary
a
man
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
may
possibly
by
a
supreme
effort
pull
himself
together
and
dangerous
to
the
last
strike
you
before
you
can
strike
him
but
here
as
usual
fashion
refuses
to
be
logical
and
the
sentiment
of
chivalry
which
we
look
for
in
all
men
does
not
nowadays
allow
us
to
make
use
of
an
advantage
which
some
day
or
other
perhaps
in
precisely
identical
circumstances
may
very
likely
be
claimed
without
scruple
iv
there
is
by
the
way
another
argument
which
i
remember
was
once
put
to
me
by
a
friend
and
which
struck
me
forcibly
at
the
time
my
friend
who
is
something
of
a
scholar
and
has
not
forgotten
his
latin
quoted
these
lines
from
virgil
ille
pedum
melior
motu
fretusque
iuventa
hic
membris
et
mole
valens
sed
tarda
trementi
genua
labant
vastos
quatit
aeger
anhelitus
artus
these
verses
describe
the
fighting
qualities
of
two
heroes
who
are
about
to
enter
the
ring
no
one
i
suppose
would
seriously
maintain
that
they
ought
to
be
handicapped
that
one
of
them
should
be
made
to
concede
some
points
in
which
he
is
superior
that
is
to
say
some
of
the
chances
in
his
favour
while
the
other
retains
all
that
he
can
muster
and
yet
can
we
not
easily
imagine
two
men
meeting
to
fight
a
duel
one
of
whom
has
in
his
favour
every
chance
but
one
advantage
of
reach
dexterity
speed
and
swordsmanship
while
the
other
relies
only
on
sound
condition
and
great
staying
power
in
an
unequal
combat
such
as
this
what
can
the
latter
do
but
tire
his
opponent
out
get
him
thoroughly
well
blown
and
so
reduce
the
balance
of
advantage
which
until
then
tells
with
full
force
against
him
the
other
man
who
thereupon
calls
for
a
truce
is
practically
asking
his
antagonist
to
forgo
his
superiority
of
sound
wind
and
limb
while
he
so
far
from
giving
up
his
own
advantages
of
reach
dexterity
and
science
has
every
intention
of
making
the
most
of
them
when
the
fight
begins
afresh
then
again
the
staying
power
which
you
handicap
is
very
likely
derived
from
a
well
developed
chest
which
incidentally
offers
a
larger
target
to
the
adverse
point
the
greater
vigour
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
its
owner
is
with
heavy
muscular
limbs
which
make
his
movements
slow
and
ponderous
why
recognise
the
inequality
of
the
match
in
the
one
case
and
disregard
it
in
the
other
suppose
added
my
friend
that
the
question
is
discussed
by
the
seconds
before
the
fight
begins
one
side
might
say
our
man
is
tired
or
blown
you
will
have
no
objection
we
presume
to
allowing
a
short
interval
can
not
agree
to
that
the
other
side
would
reply
only
chance
we
have
of
making
an
even
fight
of
it
is
that
our
man
should
outstay
yours
if
they
insist
the
answer
is
this
man
has
every
acquired
advantage
ours
has
only
the
one
advantage
of
superior
physique
if
we
are
to
give
up
our
points
you
must
forfeit
yours
and
how
can
you
some
arguments
are
so
in
conclusion
i
think
that
such
questions
may
very
properly
be
debated
between
the
seconds
but
that
they
ought
never
to
come
to
the
ears
of
the
principals
for
one
of
them
might
seem
to
be
asking
a
favour
which
the
other
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
refuse
i
feel
that
i
have
dwelt
on
this
matter
at
great
length
but
i
was
anxious
to
sift
it
thoroughly
because
it
is
of
vital
importance
and
has
often
given
rise
to
a
serious
conflict
of
opinions
i
have
tried
to
give
you
the
rights
of
the
case
in
a
strictly
impartial
spirit
exceptional
cases
may
occur
to
which
the
rule
can
not
be
applied
without
hardship
but
such
circumstances
as
for
example
the
bad
health
or
feeble
constitution
of
one
of
the
combatants
should
be
provided
for
by
arrangement
vi
one
more
question
please
continued
the
comte
de
just
to
complete
my
when
a
man
is
called
out
can
he
be
required
to
fight
two
duels
with
two
opponents
in
succession
no
that
can
not
be
expected
of
him
the
man
who
has
fought
once
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
privileged
person
and
can
not
in
any
case
be
compelled
to
cross
swords
a
second
time
tired
as
he
is
or
as
he
may
be
by
the
first
encounter
he
stands
at
a
disadvantage
in
meeting
a
fresh
antagonist
a
second
encounter
if
it
can
not
be
avoided
and
if
both
sides
consent
ought
not
to
take
place
until
the
next
day
or
after
an
interval
of
at
least
some
hours
unless
the
party
interested
that
is
to
say
the
man
who
has
already
fought
requests
that
it
may
take
place
at
once
but
on
no
account
should
the
man
who
at
a
later
stage
may
probably
or
possibly
become
a
principal
witness
the
first
encounter
either
as
a
simple
spectator
or
as
a
second
for
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
gives
him
a
real
and
indisputable
advantage
especially
if
the
duel
is
fought
with
swords
and
then
the
first
law
of
the
duel
that
it
should
be
a
fair
fight
with
no
favour
is
broken
there
is
one
case
and
strictly
speaking
only
one
in
which
his
presence
is
permissible
that
is
when
being
the
party
injured
and
therefore
having
the
choice
of
weapons
he
selects
different
weapons
from
those
employed
in
the
first
encounter
pistols
for
example
if
the
former
fight
was
with
swords
or
swords
if
it
was
fought
with
pistols
but
i
repeat
this
can
only
be
allowed
if
the
man
who
has
already
fought
wishes
it
or
consents
to
it
freely
in
any
other
circumstances
if
i
were
acting
second
on
an
occasion
of
this
sort
i
should
refuse
to
countenance
a
duel
which
i
should
consider
equally
irregular
and
unfair
vii
take
the
question
on
its
merits
in
a
duel
with
swords
there
are
two
things
you
want
to
know
first
what
is
your
opponent
natural
temper
when
he
is
fighting
in
earnest
secondly
what
is
the
character
of
his
play
and
the
quality
of
his
swordsmanship
no
one
can
deny
that
it
is
very
advantageous
to
know
whether
the
man
that
you
have
to
face
is
impatient
and
excitable
or
and
cool
whether
he
will
attack
you
with
resolution
or
play
a
waiting
game
whether
he
will
attempt
to
parry
or
simply
offer
his
point
whether
he
is
energetic
or
the
reverse
skilful
or
clumsy
an
ugly
customer
or
not
particularly
formidable
the
fact
of
your
presence
at
a
previous
encounter
is
sufficient
by
itself
to
give
you
information
on
all
these
heads
you
are
reassured
and
reinforced
undisturbed
by
doubt
and
hesitation
you
can
mature
your
plans
at
leisure
with
a
quiet
mind
you
have
been
over
the
ground
and
know
how
the
land
lies
even
if
you
have
not
the
vaguest
notion
of
fencing
if
your
ignorance
is
so
complete
that
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
make
the
best
use
of
all
this
valuable
information
still
the
fact
that
you
have
been
a
spectator
of
the
first
fight
apart
from
any
conclusions
you
may
draw
robs
of
its
imaginary
terrors
the
great
unknown
and
shows
you
what
you
have
to
do
your
antagonist
on
the
contrary
has
everything
to
learn
he
does
not
know
whether
you
are
skilful
or
incompetent
whether
he
ought
to
attack
you
or
to
wait
for
your
attack
whether
your
nerves
are
shaky
or
firm
whether
you
are
naturally
cool
or
excitable
he
is
in
the
dark
a
stranger
feeling
his
way
in
a
new
country
you
meanwhile
having
no
need
to
waste
time
on
such
deliberations
go
to
work
at
once
with
every
probability
of
winning
an
easy
victory
therefore
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
is
at
a
disadvantage
in
point
of
science
and
practice
but
superior
in
bodily
strength
soundness
of
wind
and
condition
i
maintained
that
he
has
as
much
right
to
make
full
use
of
those
advantages
as
his
opponent
has
to
use
those
which
he
possesses
so
in
the
situation
we
are
now
considering
i
maintain
that
we
must
refuse
to
allow
anything
that
goes
to
handicap
the
combatants
or
tends
to
incline
the
scales
unfairly
on
one
side
rather
than
the
other
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
considerations
that
i
have
put
forward
have
not
occurred
to
you
before
but
now
bearing
them
in
mind
can
you
say
that
you
really
and
truly
believe
that
such
a
fight
as
this
is
a
fair
fight
or
that
you
would
consent
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
that
i
have
said
everything
that
i
had
to
say
on
the
duties
of
seconds
as
they
appear
to
me
in
the
light
of
my
own
experience
and
of
the
history
of
the
subject
we
will
discuss
a
still
more
important
matter
the
methods
to
be
adopted
by
the
principals
illustration
the
tenth
evening
illustration
instinctive
i
the
next
day
found
us
lighting
our
cigars
as
usual
brilliant
conversation
you
know
can
not
be
maintained
without
something
to
smoke
our
talk
this
evening
was
to
be
about
the
methods
of
attack
and
defence
which
offer
the
most
likely
chances
of
success
in
an
actual
duel
i
began
at
once
yesterday
i
said
i
was
speaking
of
the
whole
duty
of
seconds
i
endeavoured
to
describe
as
clearly
and
fully
as
possible
what
they
ought
to
do
and
provide
for
and
i
showed
why
it
is
essential
that
they
should
follow
every
stage
and
every
incident
of
the
fight
with
the
utmost
keenness
for
the
onus
of
responsibility
is
rightly
held
to
rest
on
them
the
preliminaries
are
now
settled
the
antagonists
armed
with
swords
of
equal
length
stand
face
to
face
one
of
the
seconds
is
stationed
between
them
he
addresses
to
each
in
turn
the
venerable
formula
you
ready
on
guard
upon
their
assenting
he
steps
back
and
gives
the
fatal
word
the
fighting
is
about
to
begin
and
the
two
men
stand
expectant
neither
stirring
yet
each
sheltering
his
life
behind
a
few
inches
of
cold
steel
ii
there
are
only
three
contingencies
that
we
need
consider
which
naturally
divide
the
discussion
under
three
heads
the
first
arises
when
a
man
who
has
never
touched
a
sword
finds
himself
opposed
to
an
old
hand
the
second
when
both
antagonists
are
alike
unskilled
the
third
when
both
are
adepts
i
may
say
at
once
with
regard
to
this
last
case
that
in
a
duel
between
two
skilful
opponents
the
advantage
of
superior
science
which
one
or
the
other
of
them
may
possess
vanishes
more
often
than
not
and
is
compensated
for
by
difference
of
temperament
for
i
can
not
remind
you
too
often
that
in
actual
fighting
it
is
not
a
question
of
hitting
your
opponent
often
or
of
placing
your
point
artistically
but
of
striking
somehow
and
anyhow
one
blow
and
only
one
swords
are
not
worn
now
and
swordsmanship
as
a
necessary
part
of
polite
education
has
gone
out
of
fashion
our
more
punctilious
ancestors
prided
themselves
on
never
wounding
their
antagonist
except
with
some
thrust
ingeniously
conceived
and
brilliantly
executed
perhaps
it
was
better
so
it
was
certainly
more
picturesque
more
chivalrous
and
magnificent
to
mistake
your
sword
for
a
spit
though
you
might
succeed
in
running
your
antagonist
through
and
through
would
have
been
voted
a
blackguardly
proceeding
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
molière
principle
is
good
enough
for
us
the
other
man
and
do
be
hit
our
object
is
to
hit
no
matter
where
no
matter
how
the
art
of
fence
is
now
so
much
neglected
that
it
seldom
happens
when
two
men
go
out
to
fight
that
they
have
even
a
passable
knowledge
of
their
weapon
iii
when
a
man
knows
nothing
about
fencing
either
because
he
has
never
touched
a
sword
or
because
he
has
only
knocked
about
with
his
friends
in
a
rough
way
and
very
occasionally
his
first
thought
when
he
has
to
fight
is
to
call
on
a
professor
and
endeavour
to
obtain
some
ideas
which
will
enable
him
to
defend
himself
on
the
field
of
battle
i
will
describe
one
of
these
lessons
which
the
professor
is
expected
to
give
and
i
shall
try
to
point
out
the
only
sort
of
advice
that
is
of
universal
application
in
such
cases
the
novice
explains
that
he
has
to
go
out
the
next
morning
and
requests
the
professor
to
be
good
enough
to
give
him
a
hint
or
two
you
know
anything
about
fencing
enquires
the
professor
practically
nothing
know
that
one
holds
the
sword
by
the
hilt
and
tries
to
hit
the
other
man
with
the
point
and
that
is
about
all
i
suppose
continues
the
professor
who
will
have
his
little
joke
and
he
takes
down
a
pair
of
swords
provided
with
buttons
hands
one
to
his
pupil
and
the
lesson
begins
one
wonders
how
often
this
same
lesson
has
been
repeated
it
never
varies
and
it
never
ought
to
vary
its
whole
value
lies
in
its
simplicity
the
ignorant
fencer
can
do
nothing
without
a
cool
head
and
steady
nerve
which
are
the
more
effective
when
they
are
opposed
as
they
often
are
to
bluster
and
first
and
foremost
the
professor
must
make
his
pupil
understand
the
absolute
necessity
of
standing
firmly
on
his
feet
with
an
easy
balance
that
allows
perfect
freedom
of
movement
the
position
whatever
it
may
be
that
your
extempore
pupil
falls
into
naturally
is
the
position
you
must
accept
it
is
important
to
give
him
confidence
in
it
and
to
modify
it
only
so
far
as
is
absolutely
necessary
to
enable
him
to
move
about
easily
your
business
is
to
make
the
best
of
this
position
and
if
possible
turn
even
its
defects
to
account
the
body
should
be
inclined
forwards
rather
than
backwards
in
this
somewhat
crouching
attitude
the
upper
part
of
the
body
that
is
to
say
the
chest
by
its
advanced
position
with
the
sword
arm
held
in
front
acts
as
a
kind
of
natural
rampart
or
shield
to
cover
the
lower
part
where
a
wound
is
almost
certain
to
prove
mortal
keep
in
view
from
the
very
first
the
importance
of
inspiring
confidence
in
the
unpractised
fencer
for
confidence
alone
implies
some
sort
of
and
reacts
immediately
on
nerve
and
muscle
he
soon
begins
to
feel
somewhat
more
at
ease
some
slight
modifications
are
all
that
is
required
to
correct
the
glaring
faults
that
are
most
obviously
dangerous
i
am
not
afraid
of
putting
the
truth
of
my
statement
to
a
practical
test
if
you
will
now
all
of
you
take
one
of
those
swords
which
i
see
hanging
on
the
wall
and
place
yourselves
on
guard
not
in
what
you
imagine
to
be
a
fencing
attitude
but
as
you
would
stand
if
you
were
seriously
threatened
you
will
find
that
the
attitudes
you
assume
will
all
be
very
much
alike
apart
from
such
slight
variations
as
are
due
to
differences
of
physique
iv
come
i
be
your
shocking
example
said
one
of
my
hearers
i
have
never
touched
a
sword
in
my
life
see
what
you
can
make
of
me
very
good
i
replied
rising
as
i
spoke
and
taking
down
a
pair
of
swords
i
handed
him
one
then
without
giving
him
time
to
think
i
made
a
quick
movement
and
threatened
him
with
the
point
instinctively
he
threw
himself
on
guard
there
that
will
do
i
said
stay
as
you
are
i
only
wish
you
could
be
photographed
to
illustrate
the
instinctive
attitude
oh
do
be
too
conceited
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
your
position
is
faultless
very
far
from
that
but
the
attitude
in
which
you
are
standing
is
the
origin
of
the
orthodox
guard
as
taught
in
the
because
it
is
essentially
the
attitude
that
accords
with
our
natural
fighting
instincts
i
am
getting
tired
of
this
observed
my
patient
who
had
scrupulously
stuck
to
his
position
one
moment
i
replied
you
are
tired
because
your
arm
is
too
much
extended
draw
it
back
a
trifle
to
relax
the
muscles
and
give
them
their
natural
play
carry
yourself
more
upright
by
slightly
raising
the
body
your
left
foot
is
too
far
from
the
right
bring
it
rather
more
forward
sink
down
a
little
on
your
legs
so
as
to
be
ready
either
to
spring
quickly
to
the
rear
or
to
advance
bring
your
right
shoulder
forward
in
order
to
expose
your
chest
less
but
not
further
than
you
can
manage
with
comfort
you
see
i
am
not
very
exacting
there
that
will
do
very
well
now
if
i
make
a
movement
straighten
your
arm
boldly
and
step
back
very
well
done
and
yet
you
tell
me
you
have
never
touched
a
sword
or
even
a
foil
in
a
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
subject
for
my
demonstration
we
will
now
put
the
swords
back
in
their
place
and
return
to
our
discussion
perhaps
i
may
have
occasion
to
trouble
you
again
by
and
by
i
am
entirely
at
your
disposal
professor
replied
my
obliging
pupil
the
rest
of
the
lesson
may
be
summed
up
in
a
convenient
formula
for
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
only
one
really
useful
tip
that
a
professor
can
give
to
the
uninstructed
novice
who
says
afternoon
or
morning
i
have
to
go
out
the
professor
will
make
a
great
mistake
if
he
attempts
to
teach
him
some
fancy
stroke
for
he
will
only
disturb
the
natural
working
of
his
instinct
without
controlling
it
he
must
remember
that
the
excitement
of
fighting
does
not
leave
much
room
for
thought
and
he
must
accordingly
take
care
to
limit
his
instruction
to
the
simplest
and
clearest
ideas
easy
to
understand
and
easy
to
put
into
practice
such
as
arise
naturally
out
of
the
instinctive
sense
of
these
remarks
of
course
do
not
apply
to
those
dull
and
inert
creatures
cursed
with
a
temperament
so
heavy
and
so
sluggish
that
they
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
move
briskly
and
can
never
rise
to
the
occasion
you
can
put
nothing
into
such
as
these
and
can
get
nothing
out
of
them
when
swords
are
crossed
the
thing
to
do
is
simply
what
our
friend
here
did
just
now
retire
i
say
in
order
to
avoid
saying
away
retire
always
retire
incessantly
but
retire
little
by
little
so
as
not
to
consume
once
and
for
all
the
entire
retire
in
short
not
like
a
man
in
a
panic
but
like
one
who
is
watching
his
opportunity
never
forget
this
the
only
principle
that
at
the
critical
moment
is
available
for
him
who
can
not
count
on
science
to
assist
him
back
and
straighten
the
or
in
other
words
yourself
by
threatening
your
never
attack
that
is
the
point
on
which
your
attention
must
be
concentrated
but
exclaimed
one
of
my
hearers
what
do
you
mean
by
it
is
not
so
easy
to
threaten
when
you
are
an
absolute
duffer
vi
the
naked
point
of
a
sword
resolutely
offered
at
the
body
or
at
the
face
is
always
a
threat
no
one
who
sees
it
directed
straight
at
him
with
a
set
fixity
of
purpose
and
a
suggestive
glitter
can
fail
to
be
alarmed
by
it
or
can
afford
to
disregard
it
more
especially
perhaps
if
he
knows
that
the
man
behind
it
is
unsophisticated
and
can
not
be
depended
upon
to
obey
the
ordinary
rules
that
he
has
no
deep
design
or
artful
scheme
in
the
background
but
just
one
idea
to
keep
his
point
always
there
like
a
sentry
at
his
post
put
shortly
my
advice
amounts
to
this
defend
yourself
by
retreating
threaten
by
offering
the
point
offering
the
point
that
is
to
say
straightening
the
arm
is
the
attack
of
the
incapable
fencer
by
retreating
you
maintain
the
distance
between
yourself
and
your
opponent
and
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
get
command
of
your
blade
on
a
simulated
attack
there
is
only
one
other
movement
that
i
should
teach
to
a
novice
who
came
to
me
for
advice
in
these
circumstances
i
should
tell
him
as
he
retires
and
straightens
his
arm
to
change
the
line
occasionally
that
is
to
say
to
pass
his
point
under
his
opponent
blade
and
threaten
him
on
the
other
side
in
fact
a
simple
disengagement
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
understand
and
anyone
however
little
he
may
be
skilled
in
the
art
of
fencing
can
do
it
with
the
greatest
ease
the
act
of
retiring
itself
facilitates
the
execution
of
the
movement
an
hour
practice
will
make
him
familiar
with
this
change
of
line
which
as
i
remarked
just
now
answers
the
double
purpose
of
attack
and
defence
i
should
make
my
pupil
repeat
this
very
simple
performance
over
and
over
again
instructing
him
to
straighten
his
arm
sometimes
with
his
point
held
high
on
a
level
with
the
chest
attacking
the
high
lines
sometimes
with
the
point
lowered
attacking
the
low
lines
you
understand
of
course
what
is
meant
by
the
high
and
low
lines
it
is
the
a
b
c
of
fencing
notice
that
my
lesson
is
simplified
to
a
degree
that
is
almost
ludicrous
i
dissect
every
movement
and
explain
how
the
parts
are
put
together
being
particularly
careful
to
avoid
the
use
of
technical
terms
for
my
imaginary
pupil
is
supposed
to
be
completely
ignorant
and
he
would
be
hopelessly
puzzled
by
them
if
on
the
other
hand
he
happens
to
have
some
smattering
of
knowledge
he
will
appreciate
more
fully
and
derive
all
the
more
benefit
from
the
lesson
thus
reduced
to
its
simplest
expression
vii
you
say
nothing
remarked
one
of
my
hearers
about
the
movement
which
consists
in
reversing
the
lunge
no
i
answered
because
i
believe
that
this
device
which
is
only
proper
in
certain
exceptional
circumstances
is
likely
to
prove
very
dangerous
if
it
is
employed
at
the
wrong
moment
or
at
random
if
it
does
not
come
off
you
are
left
without
defence
at
your
mercy
to
put
the
matter
shortly
if
you
adopt
my
plan
you
retire
and
at
the
same
moment
offer
your
point
either
with
a
straight
thrust
or
with
a
disengagement
then
you
immediately
recover
your
guard
and
bring
your
forearm
back
to
its
original
position
whether
your
thrust
has
succeeded
or
not
you
are
always
provided
with
a
sound
defence
you
are
set
firmly
on
your
legs
your
balance
is
undisturbed
and
upon
your
opponent
advance
you
can
repeat
the
process
again
and
again
now
suppose
that
you
decide
to
lunge
to
the
rear
that
is
to
say
to
reverse
the
lunge
by
throwing
the
left
leg
back
to
its
full
extent
and
dropping
the
body
without
moving
the
right
foot
well
when
will
you
do
this
and
how
you
are
not
an
expert
what
secret
instinct
will
inform
you
that
the
opportune
moment
has
come
for
executing
this
manoeuvre
for
after
you
have
executed
it
you
must
recover
and
recover
smartly
if
you
are
to
regain
your
guard
no
easy
matter
i
assure
you
in
attempting
to
perform
a
movement
so
complicated
you
with
your
want
of
experience
can
hardly
fail
to
be
thrown
into
disorder
to
the
great
advantage
of
your
adversary
who
will
seize
the
opportunity
to
press
you
briskly
and
get
command
of
your
blade
even
supposing
that
you
escape
from
this
danger
you
can
not
go
on
repeating
the
process
continually
you
can
not
repeat
it
indifferently
on
every
attack
or
on
every
semblance
of
an
attack
that
is
made
upon
you
you
must
judge
your
opportunity
now
fencing
judgment
especially
in
a
duel
implies
knowledge
and
remember
we
are
arguing
on
the
assumption
that
you
are
ignorant
for
these
reasons
i
should
never
think
of
recommending
the
lunge
to
the
rear
to
anyone
who
has
not
acquired
some
familiarity
with
his
weapon
viii
if
we
now
turn
from
the
man
whose
only
chance
lies
in
his
getting
a
rule
of
thumb
to
work
by
to
the
man
who
is
more
or
less
used
to
fencing
the
case
is
different
the
scope
of
the
lesson
is
enlarged
the
pupil
knows
a
few
words
of
the
language
we
must
try
to
turn
his
knowledge
to
account
my
advice
to
him
would
be
in
the
first
place
take
the
same
guard
as
that
already
indicated
but
make
a
little
play
with
your
point
by
changing
the
line
occasionally
from
inside
to
outside
and
so
on
in
order
to
bother
your
opponent
make
a
show
of
attacking
now
and
then
in
order
to
recover
any
ground
that
you
may
have
lost
by
retreating
but
be
very
careful
never
on
any
account
to
attack
in
real
earnest
you
must
be
doubly
strong
and
doubly
sure
of
all
your
movements
to
enable
you
to
attack
without
getting
out
of
your
depth
and
perhaps
throwing
yourself
away
in
a
moment
of
inadvertence
and
then
i
should
go
on
to
say
sometimes
but
always
accompanying
the
movement
with
a
short
step
to
the
rear
make
a
parry
of
counter
quarte
and
circle
a
sweeping
parry
which
cuts
all
the
lines
and
is
bound
to
find
the
blade
somewhere
come
back
to
your
first
position
at
once
holding
your
point
well
in
front
of
your
body
then
if
you
find
that
your
opponent
means
to
develope
his
attack
fully
and
that
his
point
is
directed
high
throw
your
left
foot
back
boldly
remembering
to
drop
your
head
and
body
at
the
same
moment
in
order
to
avoid
the
point
which
would
otherwise
strike
you
in
the
upper
part
of
the
chest
or
in
the
face
above
all
recover
as
smartly
as
you
can
by
springing
quickly
to
the
rear
so
as
to
regain
your
defensive
position
before
your
adversary
if
he
has
avoided
or
parried
your
thrust
can
take
advantage
of
his
opportunity
but
once
more
i
must
caution
you
that
this
sort
of
thing
requires
such
training
and
judgment
as
i
should
not
expect
anyone
to
possess
who
has
not
by
regular
practice
made
himself
thoroughly
at
home
with
the
sword
ix
we
are
allowed
to
criticise
i
believe
remarked
the
comte
de
after
a
pause
which
followed
these
remarks
by
all
means
i
replied
i
not
only
allow
but
invite
criticism
in
working
out
an
idea
i
may
very
likely
neglect
some
side
of
it
that
ought
not
to
be
passed
over
well
you
seem
to
me
inconsistent
you
said
the
other
day
and
i
quite
agreed
with
you
first
and
fundamental
rule
of
fencing
is
to
parry
and
now
you
tell
us
on
the
contrary
not
to
attempt
to
parry
that
is
fair
criticism
i
answered
but
i
do
not
admit
the
inconsistency
you
will
remember
that
we
were
then
talking
of
scientific
fencing
that
is
to
say
of
the
systematic
study
of
swordsmanship
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
question
the
whole
art
of
fencing
can
not
be
learnt
in
three
or
four
hours
let
me
give
you
an
analogy
for
an
analogy
often
serves
to
put
an
argument
simply
two
men
are
on
a
sinking
ship
one
of
them
knows
how
to
swim
the
other
only
knows
how
to
go
to
the
bottom
and
stay
there
meanwhile
the
danger
is
immediate
would
you
say
to
the
man
who
can
not
swim
a
stroke
here
this
is
the
way
to
swim
you
move
your
arms
like
this
and
at
the
same
time
you
move
your
legs
like
that
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
he
will
be
able
to
put
into
practice
straight
away
what
you
have
just
shown
him
or
do
you
suppose
that
thanks
to
your
demonstration
he
will
be
able
to
swim
when
he
finds
himself
in
the
water
no
of
course
you
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
suppose
anything
of
the
sort
you
would
of
course
tell
him
to
catch
hold
of
something
or
other
anything
a
spar
an
oar
or
a
plank
and
to
support
himself
on
it
as
best
he
can
that
is
his
only
chance
well
my
case
is
on
all
fours
with
that
my
pupil
is
in
imminent
peril
of
his
life
my
business
is
to
give
him
the
spar
or
the
plank
which
may
serve
to
keep
him
afloat
i
do
bother
about
teaching
him
to
swim
x
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
one
from
showing
one
or
two
parries
to
the
novice
who
has
to
fight
a
duel
at
short
notice
but
the
only
parries
that
would
be
of
any
use
to
him
are
the
comprehensive
and
rather
complicated
parries
which
sweep
through
all
the
lines
what
would
be
the
result
his
parries
would
be
weak
undecided
and
slow
instead
of
tripping
neatly
round
the
blade
they
would
labour
painfully
after
it
in
wide
circles
to
deceive
them
would
be
the
merest
child
play
and
the
poor
novice
encountering
nothing
but
empty
air
would
let
his
blade
fly
into
space
and
send
his
arm
after
it
leaving
himself
completely
exposed
even
supposing
that
his
opponent
does
not
take
advantage
of
his
opportunity
the
novice
realises
how
helpless
he
is
and
racks
his
brains
for
some
device
to
avoid
the
danger
when
he
is
again
attacked
then
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
what
not
to
do
he
loses
his
head
and
is
seized
with
panic
he
strikes
wildly
at
his
opponent
blade
as
a
drowning
man
strikes
wildly
at
the
water
and
nothing
remains
to
be
done
but
to
wait
for
the
finishing
thrust
or
to
rush
blindly
at
his
opponent
with
the
probability
that
he
will
run
upon
his
point
those
are
my
reasons
for
not
attempting
to
teach
an
untutored
novice
things
which
he
can
not
possibly
perform
now
on
the
other
hand
consider
in
detail
the
measures
that
i
do
put
at
his
disposal
by
retiring
he
evades
the
point
evading
the
point
by
drawing
the
body
back
or
by
springing
to
the
rear
may
not
be
the
same
thing
as
parrying
but
it
amounts
to
much
the
same
in
the
end
since
you
retire
out
of
range
and
are
not
hit
or
if
you
are
hit
at
the
worst
you
can
be
only
lightly
touched
because
by
retiring
you
make
your
opponent
lose
the
ground
which
he
reckoned
on
gaining
by
his
attack
moreover
when
he
sees
that
you
straighten
your
arm
every
time
on
the
chance
of
reaching
him
he
dare
not
lunge
out
recklessly
if
he
does
you
have
at
least
a
chance
of
hitting
him
by
a
fluke
no
doubt
but
i
suppose
you
do
not
much
mind
that
xi
there
is
one
last
objection
that
i
will
anticipate
what
i
may
be
asked
becomes
of
your
scheme
of
defence
if
the
moment
that
the
novice
extends
his
sword
at
a
venture
the
adversary
engages
it
without
a
doubt
that
is
what
he
ought
to
do
and
what
he
will
do
as
i
shall
presently
explain
but
you
do
not
imagine
i
suppose
that
a
man
completely
ignorant
of
the
use
of
his
weapon
who
goes
to
a
professor
for
advice
on
the
eve
of
an
encounter
can
hope
to
come
away
comforted
with
the
assurance
that
he
has
learnt
the
whole
art
of
how
to
hit
his
opponent
without
being
touched
himself
that
i
fancy
would
be
too
convenient
it
would
be
better
then
to
study
the
art
of
not
learning
to
fence
instead
of
spending
months
and
years
in
studying
the
art
of
fencing
ignorance
would
indeed
be
bliss
and
wisdom
folly
the
man
who
has
not
learnt
the
use
of
the
weapon
to
which
he
entrusts
his
life
may
think
himself
lucky
if
he
can
lessen
the
chances
to
which
he
is
exposed
of
a
fatal
issue
the
master
can
hope
to
accomplish
nothing
more
than
to
give
his
pupil
some
confidence
and
show
him
the
only
course
that
can
be
commended
by
common
sense
and
at
the
same
time
furnishes
some
sort
of
defence
if
the
novice
does
what
he
is
told
he
will
i
repeat
put
difficulties
and
dangers
in
the
way
of
his
opponent
he
will
force
him
to
act
with
caution
he
will
keep
him
at
long
range
and
compel
him
to
shift
his
ground
when
he
attacks
in
shifting
his
ground
he
may
either
through
carelessness
or
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
leave
himself
uncovered
and
give
an
opening
to
the
point
that
is
continually
directed
at
him
but
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
a
wary
and
experienced
fencer
who
keeps
his
head
cool
will
not
easily
defeat
such
elementary
strategy
you
may
tell
your
pupil
to
be
prudent
you
may
tell
him
to
be
calm
and
resolute
but
now
or
never
you
should
add
the
pious
wish
help
you
xii
may
i
ask
one
more
question
said
one
of
my
friends
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
if
you
do
know
much
about
fencing
the
best
thing
to
do
is
as
soon
as
you
come
on
guard
to
make
a
sudden
rush
at
the
other
man
before
he
has
time
to
collect
himself
well
i
replied
if
you
wish
to
make
sure
of
being
incurably
spitted
that
is
the
most
infallible
way
to
set
about
it
the
seconds
before
giving
the
signal
to
begin
have
just
asked
your
opponent
if
he
is
ready
is
it
likely
that
he
will
allow
himself
to
be
rushed
or
to
be
victimised
by
such
a
transparent
piece
of
bluff
is
it
not
much
more
likely
that
he
will
have
been
told
to
look
out
for
a
surprise
attack
one
of
two
things
either
the
man
who
confronts
you
is
a
skilful
fencer
in
which
case
he
will
not
want
you
to
give
him
time
to
collect
himself
but
will
be
quite
capable
of
taking
his
own
time
or
his
ignorance
of
fencing
is
on
a
par
with
yours
and
then
it
is
a
toss
up
it
follows
that
if
this
desperate
plan
of
attack
is
chosen
because
it
is
thought
likely
to
succeed
it
is
absurd
if
however
it
is
chosen
because
the
man
who
chooses
it
is
of
a
restive
impatient
disposition
one
who
can
not
wait
and
for
whom
cool
defensive
tactics
are
an
impossibility
the
case
is
different
all
that
one
can
say
to
the
pupil
whose
temper
is
such
that
he
can
not
play
a
waiting
game
is
something
of
this
sort
trust
your
instinct
be
guided
by
your
natural
impulse
you
quite
understand
that
by
acting
as
you
propose
you
run
a
greater
risk
for
your
attack
is
delivered
at
random
you
are
embarking
on
a
wild
and
hazardous
speculation
your
only
chance
of
success
as
you
yourself
admit
is
that
you
may
by
suddenly
and
violently
letting
yourself
go
for
all
you
are
worth
take
your
opponent
by
surprise
and
put
him
off
his
parry
i
can
only
give
you
one
word
of
advice
before
letting
yourself
go
try
at
any
rate
to
beat
the
other
man
sword
out
of
line
in
any
way
you
can
knock
it
up
or
down
to
one
side
or
the
other
as
soon
as
you
have
made
your
beat
let
yourself
go
straight
without
the
least
hesitation
by
this
means
you
will
avoid
an
interchange
of
hits
or
a
stop
thrust
but
i
warn
you
this
is
not
so
easy
as
it
sounds
possibly
where
so
much
depends
on
luck
and
accident
you
may
bring
off
your
hit
but
if
you
are
the
wounded
man
you
will
be
wounded
with
a
vengeance
for
you
will
probably
run
on
the
sword
up
to
the
hilt
a
trifling
consideration
which
is
perhaps
worth
taking
into
account
this
plan
in
fact
can
never
be
recommended
it
involves
not
only
too
many
risks
but
risks
that
are
too
serious
and
too
certain
i
will
show
you
presently
in
greater
detail
why
this
is
so
when
we
look
at
the
question
from
the
other
side
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
fencer
more
or
less
skilful
who
is
opposed
to
a
novice
ignorant
of
swordsmanship
but
a
determined
natural
fighter
who
is
thoroughly
roused
by
a
keen
sense
of
danger
xiii
the
case
we
shall
consider
next
will
be
the
reverse
of
this
by
reversing
the
position
we
shall
hear
what
is
to
be
said
on
both
sides
and
we
shall
then
have
considered
from
every
point
of
view
the
probabilities
of
victory
or
defeat
which
are
likely
to
occur
in
a
duel
we
will
leave
that
for
and
so
we
broke
up
illustration
the
eleventh
evening
illustration
real
i
we
have
now
to
examine
the
duel
with
swords
from
a
different
point
of
view
the
ignorant
and
inexperienced
fencer
trying
at
the
last
moment
to
find
a
desperate
remedy
for
a
desperate
state
of
affairs
may
be
dismissed
and
we
have
now
to
consider
the
case
of
combatants
who
are
more
or
less
evenly
matched
and
who
are
fighting
in
deadly
earnest
for
as
i
have
already
said
a
duel
generally
equalises
the
forces
on
either
side
except
when
a
skilful
and
resolute
swordsman
meets
a
clumsy
hesitating
duffer
or
when
a
cool
head
is
opposed
to
that
rash
and
furious
bluster
which
more
often
than
not
leads
a
man
to
his
destruction
first
and
foremost
your
invariable
rule
must
be
distrust
your
enemy
never
be
overconfident
i
can
not
too
often
repeat
that
the
unexpected
always
turns
up
just
when
you
are
least
prepared
for
it
it
is
this
glorious
uncertainty
that
to
my
mind
makes
fighting
with
swords
the
only
sort
of
duelling
that
is
fair
and
sportsmanlike
the
only
sort
in
which
energy
courage
and
resolution
always
give
some
chance
to
the
weaker
combatant
in
a
duel
fought
with
pistols
what
a
wretched
rôle
is
assigned
to
the
combatants
energy
is
of
no
use
courage
of
no
value
you
stand
up
like
a
target
to
be
shot
at
without
any
possibility
of
defence
courage
and
cowardice
meet
on
equal
terms
the
feeblest
and
most
spiritless
sneak
may
succeed
in
defeating
the
most
determined
courage
and
the
manliest
energy
a
finger
presses
a
trigger
and
the
thing
is
done
duelling
with
pistols
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
monstrous
practice
i
am
delighted
to
see
it
disappearing
from
our
manners
and
going
more
and
more
out
of
fashion
every
day
ii
to
return
to
my
subject
there
are
certain
elementary
principles
of
from
which
the
prudent
fencer
ought
never
to
depart
principles
of
such
universal
application
that
they
may
be
considered
the
foundation
on
which
is
based
all
serious
fighting
which
is
conducted
with
any
sort
of
method
as
soon
as
the
second
who
undertakes
to
start
the
proceedings
has
put
you
on
guard
and
steps
back
leaving
you
at
liberty
to
set
to
you
should
immediately
take
two
or
three
paces
to
the
rear
before
your
opponent
can
realise
or
anticipate
what
you
are
about
by
this
means
you
at
once
put
yourself
out
of
range
and
out
of
danger
either
from
a
surprise
or
from
one
of
those
blind
and
frantic
rushes
to
which
as
we
have
seen
some
men
are
apt
to
pin
their
faith
but
exclaimed
one
of
my
hearers
not
altogether
seriously
if
your
opponent
does
the
same
thing
you
will
find
yourselves
at
a
range
more
suitable
for
pistol
practice
than
for
in
that
case
i
replied
taking
him
seriously
you
have
three
advantages
for
one
surely
a
substantial
gain
in
the
first
place
if
the
same
idea
has
occurred
to
your
opponent
as
to
you
or
if
the
same
advice
has
been
given
to
you
both
the
advice
is
the
more
likely
to
be
sound
in
the
second
place
his
quick
strategic
movement
to
the
rear
tells
you
very
plainly
that
he
too
has
no
fancy
for
a
surprise
or
for
that
rough
and
tumble
style
of
fighting
which
reduces
to
a
sort
of
fisticuffs
you
are
able
to
make
up
your
mind
at
once
that
he
is
not
that
sort
of
fighter
and
that
his
attacks
will
be
prudent
and
well
considered
in
the
third
place
the
brief
pause
gives
you
a
moment
or
two
to
pull
yourself
together
and
get
steady
to
take
a
good
look
at
your
opponent
point
and
get
over
that
first
involuntary
sensation
that
momentary
chill
which
no
one
not
even
the
bravest
of
us
ever
fails
to
experience
it
also
gives
you
time
to
run
your
eye
over
your
antagonist
and
by
noting
how
he
stands
how
he
holds
his
sword
in
a
word
how
he
shapes
to
look
the
situation
in
the
face
and
settle
your
plan
of
campaign
that
i
think
you
will
admit
is
something
gained
even
if
you
have
to
stand
for
a
few
seconds
at
a
range
which
as
you
say
seems
more
suitable
for
pistol
practice
iii
have
you
never
observed
how
all
animals
from
the
most
insignificant
creatures
up
to
the
most
savage
beasts
set
about
fighting
look
at
two
cocks
in
a
or
two
bulls
in
a
field
notice
how
they
skirmish
and
spar
before
really
letting
themselves
go
notice
the
wicked
glitter
of
their
eyes
as
they
intently
watch
for
an
opening
where
they
will
presently
plant
their
most
telling
blow
what
teaches
them
not
to
rush
at
each
other
throat
in
blind
fury
why
simply
instinct
the
science
of
which
is
common
to
every
living
thing
and
common
instinct
should
teach
you
the
same
lesson
you
will
easily
realise
how
completely
you
upset
or
at
least
disturb
the
calculations
of
the
man
who
is
clinging
to
advice
of
this
kind
moment
you
are
on
guard
lunge
before
your
opponent
has
time
to
collect
himself
or
of
the
man
whose
one
idea
is
to
make
a
wild
and
indiscriminate
charge
such
men
however
lacking
they
may
be
in
brains
can
hardly
fail
to
perceive
that
the
distance
between
you
and
them
makes
a
surprise
impracticable
if
they
do
attempt
it
their
movements
will
be
disconcerted
they
will
give
themselves
away
and
may
probably
run
upon
your
point
if
you
hold
it
straight
before
you
or
in
any
case
they
must
give
you
time
to
see
them
coming
you
may
be
attacked
no
doubt
and
attacked
furiously
but
you
will
not
be
surprised
iv
when
you
have
placed
yourself
out
of
range
you
remain
free
to
choose
your
next
move
if
your
opponent
now
seems
inclined
to
shorten
the
distance
between
you
wait
for
him
without
breaking
ground
he
is
compelled
to
advance
and
therefore
is
at
a
disadvantage
for
if
he
exposes
himself
you
are
ready
for
him
you
do
your
best
to
harass
his
advance
you
watch
your
opportunity
and
whatever
movement
he
makes
you
let
him
see
that
he
is
continually
threatened
by
your
point
he
can
not
help
giving
you
notice
of
his
attack
you
see
what
is
coming
and
are
able
to
take
your
measures
accordingly
the
way
he
manages
his
advance
and
the
accompanying
movements
of
his
point
hand
and
arm
are
sure
signs
by
which
you
can
tell
how
much
or
how
little
he
knows
if
on
the
other
hand
he
stands
on
the
defensive
and
seems
inclined
to
wait
for
your
attack
you
may
advance
cautiously
with
short
steps
keeping
your
legs
well
under
you
and
your
body
well
balanced
levelling
your
point
now
at
his
eyes
now
at
his
chest
for
you
must
be
careful
to
guard
against
the
dangers
that
i
have
just
mentioned
in
order
to
counteract
or
at
least
to
lessen
the
disadvantage
to
which
you
are
exposed
on
your
advance
you
must
occupy
your
attention
by
continually
threatening
him
in
the
different
lines
for
by
compelling
him
to
protect
himself
you
prevent
him
from
attacking
you
and
meanwhile
little
by
little
you
gain
ground
it
is
a
good
plan
to
feint
a
serious
attack
in
order
to
compel
him
to
show
his
hand
and
to
find
out
whether
he
means
to
rely
on
a
parry
or
if
he
will
simply
straighten
his
arm
but
you
must
be
very
sure
of
yourself
and
have
complete
control
of
your
movements
or
you
will
very
likely
disclose
your
own
plans
by
some
involuntary
and
incautious
gesture
all
that
i
have
said
applies
with
equal
force
to
good
and
bad
fencers
to
the
expert
as
well
as
to
the
novice
prudence
and
are
more
than
half
the
battle
to
these
must
be
added
science
which
enables
you
to
deceive
your
opponent
by
deluding
him
as
to
your
real
object
while
you
compel
him
unwillingly
to
betray
himself
i
hope
i
said
interrupting
myself
that
you
find
me
tolerably
intelligible
and
that
you
follow
the
connection
between
the
successive
steps
of
my
argument
my
audience
with
one
voice
assured
me
that
i
was
perfectly
intelligible
and
that
they
were
following
me
with
the
greatest
interest
i
may
be
a
trifle
in
dealing
with
these
points
but
please
remember
that
after
pointing
out
a
danger
or
giving
a
piece
of
advice
i
have
to
show
how
the
danger
may
be
met
by
explaining
the
answering
move
to
proceed
whichever
of
you
has
made
the
first
advance
you
are
now
within
striking
distance
if
you
are
absolutely
ignorant
of
like
the
unfortunate
duellist
whose
case
we
were
considering
last
night
i
have
already
told
you
what
in
my
opinion
you
can
do
or
at
least
may
attempt
to
do
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
on
that
head
the
opponents
that
we
now
have
in
view
are
supposed
to
have
a
knowledge
of
the
use
of
weapons
it
follows
that
the
questions
to
be
considered
will
naturally
resemble
those
that
we
have
already
discussed
when
talking
of
theoretical
and
more
particularly
of
the
assault
the
only
difference
is
the
difference
between
a
sham
fight
and
a
real
fight
the
difference
between
a
muzzled
foil
and
an
unmuzzled
sword
besides
that
in
an
assault
you
are
governed
by
conventional
restrictions
clearly
defined
and
well
understood
you
do
not
attempt
to
hit
your
opponent
except
in
accordance
with
the
rules
you
wear
a
mask
and
a
jacket
but
the
mistakes
which
you
are
most
anxious
to
avoid
in
an
assault
are
the
very
things
that
you
try
to
turn
to
account
in
a
fight
in
order
to
perplex
your
opponent
and
spoil
his
game
for
fencing
if
the
professors
will
allow
me
to
say
so
is
perhaps
the
one
art
in
which
mistakes
may
upon
occasion
prove
of
the
greatest
possible
advantage
to
him
who
makes
them
otherwise
it
would
be
mere
bookwork
to
be
learnt
more
or
less
thoroughly
and
the
man
who
knew
his
book
completely
would
have
nothing
to
fear
but
to
my
mind
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
no
knowledge
of
fencing
can
make
a
man
invulnerable
if
anyone
imagines
that
he
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
he
betrays
a
singularly
misplaced
confidence
in
his
own
powers
a
very
dangerous
error
but
ought
we
to
condemn
swordsmanship
on
that
account
my
own
opinion
is
that
this
uncertainty
is
the
great
beauty
of
the
sword
the
one
feature
that
distinguishes
it
as
the
only
weapon
for
a
fair
fight
for
even
the
weakest
player
has
his
opportunity
his
lucky
moments
his
strokes
of
fortune
which
must
always
prevent
the
duel
from
degenerating
into
simple
butchery
if
fencing
were
an
exact
science
if
you
knew
that
as
sure
as
two
and
two
make
four
you
could
certainly
hit
your
man
and
that
he
as
certainly
could
not
hit
you
how
could
you
in
common
honesty
cross
swords
with
him
vi
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
been
wandering
somewhat
from
my
text
but
this
digression
though
it
may
at
first
sight
seem
out
of
place
still
when
one
comes
to
consider
it
is
very
closely
connected
with
our
subject
for
it
serves
to
emphasise
once
more
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
every
probability
luck
may
always
turn
the
scale
in
favour
of
the
other
side
and
to
remind
you
that
you
can
not
attach
too
much
importance
to
the
most
minute
particulars
of
your
defence
habitual
mistrust
is
one
of
the
most
necessary
requirements
for
this
complicated
art
put
in
another
way
it
is
the
careful
study
of
the
enemy
whom
you
have
to
face
the
mistrust
that
marks
the
wary
calculating
player
not
only
preserves
him
from
danger
but
creates
dangers
for
his
opponent
vii
i
was
saying
the
other
day
that
i
did
not
believe
in
secret
thrusts
and
that
the
thrusts
that
have
received
this
absurd
misnomer
are
nothing
but
strokes
that
are
not
generally
recognised
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
fencing
strip
them
of
their
imaginary
terrors
and
far
from
being
dangerous
to
you
they
become
more
than
a
little
dangerous
for
the
man
who
attempts
them
to
describe
them
we
need
not
distinguish
more
than
two
sorts
methods
of
attack
and
methods
of
evading
or
dodging
an
opponent
attack
these
tricks
are
all
very
much
of
the
same
character
take
this
for
an
example
lunge
as
though
you
were
making
a
simple
attack
then
suddenly
draw
your
arm
back
to
make
your
opponent
parry
in
the
air
throw
yourself
out
of
line
and
let
drive
hitting
him
in
the
ribs
or
again
after
a
false
attack
dodge
by
stooping
low
to
avoid
the
parry
and
riposte
and
hit
your
opponent
in
the
low
lines
the
sudden
disappearance
of
your
body
will
probably
astonish
him
some
men
delight
in
charging
at
you
with
a
shout
at
the
same
time
drawing
back
their
arm
to
avoid
your
parry
this
strange
occasionally
has
the
effect
of
causing
a
moment
involuntary
pause
of
which
they
take
advantage
to
drive
their
point
home
anyhow
and
anywhere
others
again
when
the
blades
are
engaged
in
tierce
suddenly
bring
their
left
foot
to
the
front
at
the
same
time
swinging
the
body
round
left
shoulder
forward
and
out
of
line
with
your
point
if
on
the
other
hand
these
strokes
which
if
not
foul
are
decidedly
irregular
are
employed
to
meet
an
attack
the
same
thing
is
done
with
slight
variations
suppose
i
deliver
an
attack
my
opponent
instead
of
parrying
springs
aside
out
of
line
sword
and
body
vanish
the
target
has
moved
away
my
attack
loses
itself
in
space
and
i
am
hit
by
a
flank
movement
or
again
he
ducks
suddenly
supporting
himself
on
his
free
hand
and
allows
my
point
to
pass
harmlessly
over
his
head
while
at
the
same
time
he
hits
me
somewhere
in
the
low
lines
of
course
or
again
he
seizes
my
blade
in
tierce
swings
the
left
foot
round
to
the
front
suddenly
arrives
at
close
quarters
and
before
i
have
time
either
to
retreat
or
to
recover
my
guard
stabs
me
by
drawing
back
or
dropping
his
hand
i
might
extend
this
list
of
examples
indefinitely
but
you
see
that
all
these
strokes
are
contrived
on
the
same
plan
and
only
differ
from
each
other
in
unimportant
details
it
needs
no
argument
to
prove
how
completely
the
man
who
resorts
to
such
tactics
gives
himself
away
if
they
are
unsuccessful
for
in
order
to
make
them
really
formidable
there
must
be
no
hanging
back
you
must
let
yourself
go
without
the
least
reserve
viii
but
surely
someone
objected
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
swordsman
they
would
be
doubly
dangerous
that
contingency
i
replied
is
worth
considering
but
a
skilful
swordsman
would
be
very
unlikely
to
resort
to
such
methods
why
should
he
if
his
opponent
is
a
duffer
he
has
no
need
to
be
so
tricky
if
on
the
other
hand
his
opponent
is
a
fencer
as
skilful
as
himself
he
knows
the
penalty
of
failure
too
well
to
make
the
attempt
i
need
hardly
tell
you
though
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
the
fact
already
that
when
you
attack
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
not
to
let
yourself
go
so
completely
that
you
can
not
recover
your
defensive
position
if
your
attack
fails
all
these
remarks
illustrate
how
necessary
it
is
to
distrust
your
enemy
to
approach
a
strange
antagonist
with
caution
and
always
keep
him
at
a
distance
by
retreating
the
moment
you
come
on
guard
you
have
already
provided
against
a
surprise
and
against
wild
rushes
when
you
are
within
range
take
my
advice
and
do
not
join
blades
and
always
as
much
as
possible
avoid
coming
to
such
close
quarters
that
your
opponent
can
reach
you
without
breaking
ground
but
do
not
misunderstand
me
when
i
tell
you
not
to
join
blades
i
do
not
mean
that
you
are
never
to
cover
yourself
and
never
to
allow
the
blades
to
meet
that
would
be
a
mistake
all
that
i
mean
is
that
you
should
take
care
never
to
allow
your
opponent
to
hold
your
blade
by
playing
light
and
refusing
a
proffered
engagement
you
put
a
stop
to
all
forcing
strokes
beats
binds
which
are
the
most
dangerous
of
all
strokes
because
they
are
the
most
certain
i
call
them
certain
because
by
holding
your
blade
prisoner
they
control
it
forcibly
and
make
a
stop
thrust
or
an
exchange
of
hits
impossible
ix
there
are
of
course
several
ways
of
dealing
with
a
man
who
refuses
to
engage
but
they
are
difficult
and
require
much
practice
it
generally
happens
that
your
refusal
disconcerts
your
opponent
he
has
no
definite
point
to
start
from
he
hesitates
and
his
hesitation
retards
his
attack
if
his
attack
is
complicated
you
may
venture
on
a
stop
thrust
offered
with
caution
and
accompanied
by
a
short
step
to
the
rear
and
you
worry
and
annoy
and
wear
him
out
to
the
best
of
your
ability
if
his
attack
is
simple
he
will
be
afraid
of
an
exchange
of
hits
and
the
more
skilful
he
is
the
more
cautious
you
will
find
him
and
as
i
said
when
speaking
of
the
assault
you
may
lessen
the
danger
of
a
simple
attack
by
a
brisk
retreat
to
a
greater
or
less
distance
as
the
case
may
be
by
this
means
you
parry
more
easily
you
increase
the
distance
to
be
traversed
and
you
counteract
the
rapidity
of
the
attack
by
two
methods
of
defence
instead
of
one
if
you
are
hit
the
wound
is
slight
or
at
all
events
much
less
severe
than
it
would
have
been
if
you
had
tried
to
parry
without
breaking
ground
if
on
the
other
hand
your
parry
is
successful
you
have
escaped
the
danger
of
a
à
and
are
in
a
better
position
for
delivering
your
riposte
so
much
for
the
defence
now
let
us
suppose
that
you
are
the
attacking
party
you
attack
either
because
you
place
more
reliance
on
the
quickness
of
your
hand
than
on
the
certainty
of
your
riposte
or
because
your
opponent
by
confining
himself
to
defensive
tactics
compels
you
to
do
so
you
must
be
doubly
cautious
now
x
if
it
is
important
as
i
have
just
now
pointed
out
to
avoid
engaging
blades
when
you
are
acting
on
the
defensive
in
order
to
protect
yourself
from
what
may
be
called
attacks
on
the
sword
it
is
obviously
of
equal
importance
never
to
attack
without
first
attempting
to
master
your
opponent
eschew
feints
i
have
shown
you
how
dangerous
they
are
therefore
be
content
with
direct
attacks
prefacing
them
with
an
engagement
in
or
or
with
a
pressure
or
a
beat
light
or
heavy
accordingly
as
you
wish
to
draw
your
opponent
to
one
line
or
another
your
object
will
be
gained
more
easily
if
he
is
willing
to
join
blades
if
on
the
other
hand
he
is
unwilling
to
do
so
you
must
by
force
or
fraud
bring
him
to
an
engagement
and
you
should
never
finish
your
attack
until
you
have
succeeded
in
finding
his
blade
unless
in
his
efforts
to
elude
you
he
leaves
himself
completely
exposed
when
that
happens
a
straight
thrust
is
a
certainty
what
you
have
most
to
fear
is
a
stop
thrust
the
straightening
of
your
opponent
arm
on
your
preparation
or
advance
this
is
generally
a
favourite
stroke
with
those
who
deliberately
stand
on
the
defensive
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
refusal
to
join
blades
may
be
successfully
met
by
a
simulated
attack
if
it
is
well
marked
either
your
opponent
attempts
to
parry
or
he
straightens
his
arm
whereupon
you
immediately
engage
his
blade
and
drive
your
attack
home
without
quitting
his
blade
and
above
all
without
any
feint
xi
it
is
evidently
impossible
to
enumerate
in
the
course
of
conversation
all
the
situations
that
may
occur
or
to
describe
all
the
traps
that
you
may
set
for
your
opponent
or
that
he
may
set
for
you
these
things
are
matters
of
instinct
and
inspiration
the
happy
thoughts
of
the
moment
and
depend
on
character
and
individual
temperament
physical
and
moral
the
art
of
fighting
can
not
of
course
be
learnt
in
a
day
it
grows
upon
you
gradually
as
you
learn
by
experience
to
combine
the
various
elements
scientifically
into
a
whole
picture
for
yourselves
two
men
you
see
them
at
one
moment
standing
their
full
height
the
next
bent
double
swerving
to
right
and
left
colliding
violently
and
entangled
in
a
furious
encounter
suddenly
they
break
away
recoiling
from
each
other
with
a
bound
rest
for
a
moment
panting
and
glaring
till
suddenly
they
renew
the
struggle
do
you
suppose
that
all
these
intricate
evolutions
and
the
subtle
application
of
muscular
force
that
they
imply
can
be
systematically
analysed
and
taught
of
course
not
in
every
art
proficiency
can
only
be
obtained
by
persistent
and
intelligent
application
practice
alone
makes
perfect
it
is
by
studying
combinations
by
trying
to
adapt
the
means
at
his
disposal
to
the
object
in
view
that
the
artist
tests
the
limits
of
his
art
and
discovers
its
hidden
secrets
fashions
it
at
will
and
makes
it
his
obedient
slave
these
remarks
would
not
be
complete
if
i
failed
to
caution
you
against
a
very
pernicious
habit
which
one
is
apt
to
contract
in
the
and
which
in
a
duel
may
easily
lead
to
a
fatal
issue
i
mean
the
habit
of
stopping
after
you
have
made
a
hit
instead
of
immediately
recovering
your
guard
and
putting
yourself
out
of
distance
never
forget
this
important
point
if
you
do
you
may
after
wounding
your
opponent
receive
a
mortal
wound
for
which
you
will
have
only
yourself
to
blame
every
fencer
knows
how
commonly
it
happens
in
an
assault
that
a
man
ripostes
automatically
after
he
is
hit
and
strikes
his
opponent
almost
simultaneously
especially
when
the
latter
has
not
taken
the
trouble
to
attend
strictly
to
his
recovery
remember
that
a
even
though
it
be
mortal
does
not
take
effect
immediately
there
is
always
a
momentary
interval
before
the
wounded
man
falters
or
drops
his
sword
or
falls
to
the
ground
unconscious
the
moment
you
think
you
have
made
a
hit
for
you
may
be
mistaken
get
back
as
smartly
as
you
can
and
be
ready
to
go
on
fighting
xii
well
i
added
after
a
short
pause
nothing
else
occurs
to
me
in
the
way
of
general
advice
which
i
can
commend
to
your
notice
when
the
time
for
actual
fighting
arrives
your
attention
must
be
concentrated
on
the
important
points
and
these
may
be
summed
up
in
two
or
three
words
caution
restrained
and
energy
you
have
given
us
most
excellent
advice
exclaimed
the
comte
de
if
one
could
only
think
of
it
all
at
the
critical
moment
one
would
be
well
provided
think
of
only
half
of
it
i
answered
and
you
will
not
do
so
badly
there
are
so
many
men
who
can
not
think
at
all
xiii
the
next
day
we
all
met
as
usual
in
the
well
someone
asked
me
what
are
you
going
to
talk
about
why
i
answered
my
subject
is
exhausted
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
or
at
any
rate
all
that
i
think
worth
knowing
