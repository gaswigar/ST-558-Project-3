charles
merrill
life
of
emerson
ralph
waldo
emerson
was
born
in
boston
may
he
was
descended
from
a
long
line
of
new
england
ministers
men
of
refinement
and
education
as
a
he
was
quiet
and
retiring
reading
a
great
deal
but
not
paying
much
attention
to
his
lessons
he
entered
harvard
at
the
early
age
of
fourteen
but
never
attained
a
high
rank
there
although
he
took
a
prize
for
an
essay
on
socrates
and
was
made
class
poet
after
several
others
had
declined
next
to
his
reserve
and
the
faultless
propriety
of
his
conduct
his
contemporaries
at
college
seemed
most
impressed
by
the
great
maturity
of
his
mind
emerson
appears
never
to
have
been
really
a
boy
he
was
always
serene
and
thoughtful
impressing
all
who
knew
him
with
that
spirituality
which
was
his
most
distinguishing
characteristic
after
graduating
from
college
he
taught
school
for
a
time
and
then
entered
the
harvard
divinity
school
under
channing
the
great
unitarian
preacher
although
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
attend
all
the
lectures
of
the
divinity
course
the
college
authorities
deemed
the
name
emerson
sufficient
passport
to
the
ministry
he
was
accordingly
approbated
to
preach
by
the
middlesex
association
of
ministers
on
october
as
a
preacher
emerson
was
interesting
though
not
particularly
original
his
talent
seems
to
have
been
in
giving
new
meaning
to
the
old
truths
of
religion
one
of
his
hearers
has
said
in
looking
back
on
his
preaching
i
find
he
has
impressed
truths
to
which
i
always
assented
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
appear
new
like
a
clearer
revelation
although
his
sermons
were
always
couched
in
scriptural
language
they
were
touched
with
the
light
of
that
genius
which
avoids
the
conventional
and
commonplace
in
his
other
pastoral
duties
emerson
was
not
quite
so
successful
it
is
characteristic
of
his
deep
humanity
and
his
dislike
for
all
fuss
and
commonplace
that
he
appeared
to
least
advantage
at
a
funeral
a
connoisseur
in
such
matters
an
old
sexton
once
remarked
that
on
such
occasions
he
did
not
appear
at
ease
at
all
to
tell
the
truth
in
my
opinion
that
young
man
was
not
born
to
be
a
minister
emerson
did
not
long
remain
a
minister
in
he
preached
a
sermon
in
which
he
announced
certain
views
in
regard
to
the
communion
service
which
were
disapproved
by
a
large
part
of
his
congregation
he
found
it
impossible
to
continue
preaching
and
with
the
most
friendly
feelings
on
both
sides
he
parted
from
his
congregation
a
few
months
later
he
went
to
europe
for
a
short
year
of
travel
while
abroad
he
visited
walter
savage
landor
coleridge
and
wordsworth
and
thomas
carlyle
this
visit
to
carlyle
was
to
both
men
a
most
interesting
experience
they
parted
feeling
that
they
had
much
intellectually
in
common
this
belief
fostered
a
sympathy
which
by
the
time
they
had
discovered
how
different
they
really
were
had
grown
so
strong
a
habit
that
they
always
kept
up
their
intimacy
this
year
of
travel
opened
emerson
eyes
to
many
things
of
which
he
had
previously
been
ignorant
he
had
profited
by
detachment
from
the
concerns
of
a
limited
community
and
an
isolated
church
after
his
return
he
began
to
find
his
true
field
of
activity
in
the
and
delivered
a
number
of
addresses
in
boston
and
its
vicinity
while
thus
coming
before
the
open
public
on
the
lecture
platform
he
was
all
the
time
preparing
the
treatise
which
was
to
embody
all
the
quintessential
elements
of
his
philosophical
doctrine
this
was
the
essay
which
was
published
in
by
its
conception
of
external
nature
as
an
incarnation
of
the
divine
mind
it
struck
the
fundamental
principle
of
emerson
religious
belief
the
essay
had
a
very
small
circulation
at
first
though
later
it
became
widely
known
in
the
winter
of
emerson
followed
up
his
discourse
on
nature
by
a
course
of
twelve
lectures
on
the
philosophy
of
history
a
considerable
portion
of
which
eventually
became
embodied
in
his
essays
the
next
year
was
the
year
of
the
delivery
of
the
thinking
or
the
american
address
before
the
phi
beta
kappa
society
at
cambridge
this
society
composed
of
the
first
men
in
each
class
graduating
from
college
has
annual
meetings
which
have
called
forth
the
best
efforts
of
many
distinguished
scholars
and
thinkers
emerson
address
was
listened
to
with
the
most
profound
interest
it
declared
a
sort
of
intellectual
independence
for
america
henceforth
we
were
to
be
emancipated
from
clogging
foreign
influences
and
a
national
literature
was
to
expand
under
the
fostering
care
of
the
republic
these
two
discourses
and
american
strike
the
keynote
of
emerson
philosophical
poetical
and
moral
teachings
in
fact
he
had
as
every
great
teacher
has
only
a
limited
number
of
principles
and
theories
to
teach
these
principles
of
life
can
all
be
enumerated
in
twenty
words
culture
intellectual
and
moral
independence
the
divinity
of
nature
and
man
the
necessity
of
labor
and
high
ideals
emerson
spent
the
latter
part
of
his
life
in
lecturing
and
in
literary
work
his
son
edward
emerson
gave
an
interesting
account
of
how
these
lectures
were
constructed
all
through
his
life
he
kept
a
journal
this
book
he
said
was
his
bank
the
thoughts
thus
received
and
garnered
in
his
journals
were
indexed
and
a
great
many
of
them
appeared
in
his
published
works
they
were
religiously
set
down
just
as
they
came
in
no
order
except
chronological
but
later
they
were
grouped
enlarged
or
pruned
illustrated
worked
into
a
lecture
or
discourse
and
after
having
in
this
capacity
undergone
repeated
testing
and
rearranging
were
finally
carefully
sifted
and
more
rigidly
pruned
and
were
printed
as
essays
besides
his
essays
and
lectures
emerson
left
some
poetry
in
which
is
embodied
those
thoughts
which
were
to
him
too
deep
for
prose
expression
oliver
wendell
holmes
in
speaking
of
this
says
emerson
wrote
occasionally
in
verse
from
his
until
he
had
reached
the
age
which
used
to
be
known
as
the
grand
climacteric
his
poems
are
not
and
hardly
can
become
popular
they
are
not
meant
to
be
liked
by
the
many
but
to
be
dearly
loved
and
cherished
by
the
few
his
occasional
lawlessness
in
technical
construction
his
somewhat
fantastic
expressions
his
enigmatic
obscurities
hardly
detract
from
the
pleasant
surprise
his
verses
so
often
bring
with
them
the
poetic
license
which
we
allow
in
the
verse
of
emerson
is
more
than
excused
by
the
noble
spirit
which
makes
us
forget
its
occasional
blemishes
sometimes
to
be
pleased
with
them
as
characteristic
of
the
writer
emerson
was
always
a
striking
figure
in
the
intellectual
life
of
america
his
discourses
were
above
all
things
inspiring
through
them
many
were
induced
to
strive
for
a
higher
his
influence
can
be
discerned
in
all
the
literary
movements
of
the
time
he
was
the
central
figure
of
the
transcendental
school
which
was
so
prominent
fifty
years
ago
although
he
always
rather
held
aloof
from
any
enthusiastic
participation
in
the
movement
emerson
lived
a
quiet
life
in
concord
massachusetts
he
was
a
neighbor
and
one
who
always
kept
his
fences
up
he
traveled
extensively
on
his
lecturing
tours
even
going
as
far
as
england
in
he
has
recorded
his
impressions
of
what
he
saw
of
english
life
and
manners
oliver
wendell
holmes
has
described
him
in
this
wise
his
personal
appearance
was
that
of
the
typical
new
englander
of
ancestry
tall
spare
slender
with
sloping
shoulders
slightly
stooping
in
his
later
years
with
light
hair
and
eyes
the
complexion
the
prominent
somewhat
arched
nose
which
belongs
to
many
of
the
new
england
thin
lips
suggestive
of
delicacy
but
having
nothing
like
primness
still
less
of
the
rigidity
which
is
often
noticeable
in
the
generation
succeeding
next
to
that
of
the
men
in
their
he
would
have
been
noticed
anywhere
as
one
evidently
a
scholarly
thinker
astray
from
the
alcove
or
the
study
which
were
his
natural
habitats
his
voice
was
very
sweet
and
penetrating
without
any
loudness
or
mark
of
effort
his
enunciation
was
beautifully
clear
but
he
often
hesitated
as
if
waiting
for
the
right
word
to
present
itself
his
manner
was
very
quiet
his
smile
was
pleasant
but
he
did
not
like
explosive
laughter
any
better
than
hawthorne
did
none
who
met
him
can
fail
to
recall
that
serene
and
kindly
presence
in
which
there
was
mingled
a
certain
spiritual
remoteness
with
the
most
benignant
human
welcome
to
all
who
were
privileged
to
enjoy
his
companionship
emerson
died
april
after
a
few
days
illness
from
pneumonia
garnett
in
his
excellent
biography
says
seldom
had
reaper
whose
name
is
death
gathered
such
illustrious
harvest
as
between
december
and
april
in
the
first
month
of
this
period
george
eliot
passed
away
in
the
ensuing
february
carlyle
followed
in
april
lord
beaconsfield
died
deplored
by
his
party
nor
unregretted
by
his
country
in
february
of
the
following
year
longfellow
was
carried
to
the
tomb
in
april
rossetti
was
laid
to
rest
by
the
sea
and
the
pavement
of
westminster
abbey
was
disturbed
to
receive
the
dust
of
darwin
and
now
emerson
lay
down
in
death
beside
the
painter
of
man
and
the
searcher
of
nature
the
statesman
the
poet
of
the
plain
man
and
the
poet
of
the
artist
and
the
prophet
whose
name
is
indissolubly
linked
with
his
own
all
these
men
passed
into
eternity
laden
with
the
spoils
of
time
but
of
none
of
them
could
it
be
said
as
of
emerson
that
the
most
shining
intellectual
glory
and
the
most
potent
intellectual
force
of
a
continent
had
departed
along
with
him
critical
opinions
of
emerson
and
his
writings
matthew
arnold
in
an
address
on
emerson
delivered
in
boston
gave
an
excellent
estimate
of
the
rank
we
should
accord
to
him
in
the
great
hierarchy
of
letters
some
perhaps
will
think
that
arnold
was
unappreciative
and
cold
but
dispassionate
readers
will
be
inclined
to
agree
with
his
judgment
of
our
great
american
after
a
review
of
the
poetical
works
of
emerson
the
english
critic
draws
his
conclusions
as
follows
i
do
not
then
place
emerson
among
the
great
poets
but
i
go
farther
and
say
that
i
do
not
place
him
among
the
great
writers
the
great
men
of
letters
who
are
the
great
men
of
letters
they
are
men
like
cicero
plato
bacon
pascal
swift
voltaire
writers
with
in
the
first
place
a
genius
and
instinct
for
style
brilliant
and
powerful
passages
in
a
man
writings
do
not
prove
his
possession
of
it
emerson
has
passages
of
noble
and
pathetic
eloquence
he
has
passages
of
shrewd
and
felicitous
wit
he
has
crisp
epigram
he
has
passages
of
exquisitely
touched
observation
of
nature
yet
he
is
not
a
great
writer
carlyle
formulates
perfectly
the
defects
of
his
friend
poetic
and
literary
productions
when
he
says
me
it
is
too
ethereal
speculative
theoretic
i
will
have
all
things
condense
themselves
take
shape
and
body
if
they
are
to
have
my
sympathy
not
with
the
miltons
and
grays
not
with
the
platos
and
spinozas
not
with
the
swifts
and
voltaires
not
with
the
montaignes
and
addisons
can
we
rank
emerson
no
man
could
see
this
clearer
than
emerson
himself
my
friend
he
writes
in
reply
to
carlyle
who
had
exhorted
him
to
creative
work
my
friend
i
can
do
no
such
gay
thing
as
you
say
i
do
not
belong
to
the
poets
but
only
to
a
low
department
of
literature
the
reporters
suburban
men
he
deprecated
his
friend
praise
praise
to
a
fault
he
calls
it
praise
to
the
shaming
of
me
cold
fastidious
ebbing
person
that
i
am
after
all
this
unfavorable
criticism
arnold
begins
to
praise
quoting
passages
from
the
essays
he
adds
this
is
tonic
indeed
and
let
no
one
object
that
it
is
too
general
that
more
practical
positive
direction
is
what
we
want
yes
truly
his
insight
is
admirable
his
truth
is
precious
yet
the
secret
of
his
effect
is
not
even
in
these
it
is
in
his
temper
it
is
in
the
hopeful
serene
beautiful
temper
wherewith
these
in
emerson
are
indissolubly
united
in
which
they
work
and
have
their
being
one
can
scarcely
overrate
the
importance
of
holding
fast
to
happiness
and
hope
it
gives
to
emerson
work
an
invaluable
virtue
as
poetry
is
in
my
judgment
the
most
important
done
in
verse
in
our
language
during
the
present
century
so
emerson
essays
are
i
think
the
most
important
work
done
in
prose
but
by
his
conviction
that
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
is
happiness
and
by
his
hope
that
this
life
of
the
spirit
will
come
more
and
more
to
be
sanely
understood
and
to
prevail
and
to
work
for
happiness
by
this
conviction
and
hope
emerson
was
great
and
he
will
surely
prove
in
the
end
to
have
been
right
in
them
you
can
not
prize
him
too
much
nor
heed
him
too
diligently
herman
grimm
a
german
critic
of
great
influence
in
his
own
country
did
much
to
obtain
a
hearing
for
emerson
works
in
germany
at
first
the
germans
could
not
understand
the
unusual
english
the
unaccustomed
turns
of
phrase
which
are
so
characteristic
of
emerson
style
macaulay
gives
them
no
difficulty
even
carlyle
is
comprehended
but
in
emerson
writings
the
broad
turnpike
is
suddenly
changed
into
a
hazardous
sandy
his
thoughts
and
his
style
are
american
he
is
not
writing
for
berlin
but
for
the
people
of
massachusetts
it
is
an
art
to
rise
above
what
we
have
been
taught
all
great
men
are
seen
to
possess
this
freedom
they
derive
their
standard
from
their
own
natures
and
their
observations
on
life
are
so
natural
and
spontaneous
that
it
would
seem
as
if
the
most
illiterate
person
with
a
scrap
of
would
have
made
the
same
we
become
wiser
with
them
and
know
not
how
the
difficult
appears
easy
and
the
involved
plain
emerson
possesses
this
noble
manner
of
communicating
himself
he
inspires
me
with
courage
and
confidence
he
has
read
and
seen
but
conceals
the
labor
i
meet
in
his
works
plenty
of
familiar
facts
but
he
does
not
employ
them
to
figure
up
anew
the
old
problems
each
stands
on
a
new
spot
and
serves
for
new
combinations
from
everything
he
sees
the
direct
line
issuing
which
connects
it
with
the
focus
of
life
emerson
theory
is
that
of
the
of
the
individual
to
discover
what
a
young
man
is
good
for
and
to
equip
him
for
the
path
he
is
to
strike
out
in
life
regardless
of
any
other
consideration
is
the
great
duty
to
which
he
calls
attention
he
makes
men
he
reveals
to
the
eyes
of
the
idealist
the
magnificent
results
of
practical
activity
and
unfolds
before
the
realist
the
grandeur
of
the
ideal
world
of
thought
no
man
is
to
allow
himself
through
prejudice
to
make
a
mistake
in
choosing
the
task
to
which
he
will
devote
his
life
emerson
essays
are
as
it
were
printed
sermons
all
having
this
same
text
the
wealth
and
harmony
of
his
language
overpowered
and
entranced
me
anew
but
even
now
i
can
not
say
wherein
the
secret
of
his
influence
lies
what
he
has
written
is
like
life
itself
the
unbroken
thread
ever
lengthened
through
the
addition
of
the
small
events
which
make
up
each
experience
froude
in
his
famous
life
of
carlyle
gives
an
interesting
description
of
emerson
visit
to
the
carlyles
in
scotland
the
carlyles
were
sitting
alone
at
dinner
on
a
sunday
afternoon
at
the
end
of
august
when
a
dumfries
carriage
drove
to
the
door
and
there
stepped
out
of
it
a
young
american
then
unknown
to
fame
but
whose
influence
in
his
own
country
equals
that
of
carlyle
in
ours
and
whose
name
stands
connected
with
his
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
emerson
the
younger
of
the
two
had
just
broken
his
unitarian
fetters
and
was
looking
out
around
him
like
a
young
eagle
longing
for
light
he
had
read
carlyle
articles
and
had
discerned
with
the
instinct
of
genius
that
here
was
a
voice
speaking
real
and
fiery
convictions
and
no
longer
echoes
and
conventionalisms
he
had
come
to
europe
to
study
its
social
and
spiritual
phenomena
and
to
the
young
emerson
as
to
the
old
goethe
the
most
important
of
them
appeared
to
be
carlyle
the
acquaintance
then
begun
to
their
mutual
pleasure
ripened
into
a
deep
friendship
which
has
remained
unclouded
in
spite
of
wide
divergences
of
opinion
throughout
their
working
lives
carlyle
wrote
to
his
mother
after
emerson
had
left
our
third
happiness
was
the
arrival
of
a
certain
young
unknown
friend
named
emerson
from
boston
in
the
united
states
who
turned
aside
so
far
from
his
british
french
and
italian
travels
to
see
me
here
he
had
an
introduction
from
mill
and
a
frenchman
baron
nephew
whom
john
knew
at
rome
of
course
we
could
do
no
other
than
welcome
him
the
rather
as
he
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
most
lovable
creatures
in
himself
we
had
ever
looked
on
he
stayed
till
next
day
with
us
and
talked
and
heard
to
his
heart
content
and
left
us
all
really
sad
to
part
with
him
in
carlyle
wrote
to
john
sterling
a
few
words
apropos
of
the
recent
publication
of
emerson
essays
in
england
i
love
emerson
book
not
for
its
detached
opinions
not
even
for
the
scheme
of
the
general
world
he
has
framed
for
himself
or
any
eminence
of
talent
he
has
expressed
that
with
but
simply
because
it
is
his
own
book
because
there
is
a
tone
of
veracity
an
unmistakable
air
of
its
being
and
a
real
utterance
of
a
human
soul
not
a
mere
echo
of
such
i
consider
it
in
that
sense
highly
remarkable
rare
very
rare
in
these
days
of
ours
ach
gott
it
is
frightful
to
live
among
echoes
the
few
that
read
the
book
i
imagine
will
get
benefit
of
it
to
america
i
sometimes
say
that
emerson
such
as
he
is
seems
to
me
like
a
kind
of
new
era
john
morley
the
acute
english
critic
has
made
an
analytic
study
of
emerson
style
which
may
reconcile
the
reader
to
some
of
its
exasperating
peculiarities
one
of
the
traits
that
every
critic
notes
in
emerson
writing
is
that
it
is
so
abrupt
so
sudden
in
its
transitions
so
discontinuous
so
inconsecutive
dislike
of
a
sentence
that
drags
made
him
unconscious
of
the
quality
that
french
critics
name
everything
is
thrown
in
just
as
it
comes
and
sometimes
the
is
enough
to
persuade
us
that
pope
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
said
that
no
one
qualification
is
so
likely
to
make
a
good
writer
as
the
power
of
rejecting
his
own
thoughts
apart
from
his
difficult
staccato
emerson
is
not
free
from
secondary
faults
he
uses
words
that
are
not
only
odd
but
vicious
in
construction
he
is
sometimes
oblique
and
he
is
often
clumsy
and
there
is
a
visible
feeling
after
epigrams
that
do
not
always
come
when
people
say
that
emerson
style
must
be
good
and
admirable
because
it
fits
his
thought
they
forget
that
though
it
is
well
that
a
robe
should
fit
there
is
still
something
to
be
said
about
its
cut
and
fashion
yet
as
happens
to
all
fine
minds
there
came
to
emerson
ways
of
expression
deeply
marked
with
character
on
every
page
there
is
set
the
strong
stamp
of
sincerity
and
the
attraction
of
a
certain
artlessness
the
most
awkward
sentence
rings
true
and
there
is
often
a
pure
and
simple
note
that
touches
us
more
than
if
it
were
the
perfection
of
elaborated
melody
the
uncouth
procession
of
the
periods
discloses
the
travail
of
the
thought
and
that
too
is
a
kind
of
eloquence
an
honest
reader
easily
forgives
the
rude
jolt
or
unexpected
start
when
it
shows
a
thinker
faithfully
working
his
way
along
arduous
and
unworn
tracks
even
at
the
roughest
emerson
often
interjects
a
delightful
cadence
as
he
says
of
landor
his
sentences
are
cubes
which
will
stand
firm
place
them
how
or
where
you
will
he
criticised
swedenborg
for
being
superfluously
explanatory
and
having
an
exaggerated
feeling
of
the
ignorance
of
men
take
truths
of
this
nature
said
emerson
fast
and
his
own
style
does
no
doubt
very
boldly
take
this
capacity
for
granted
in
us
in
and
pith
of
diction
again
of
which
lowell
speaks
he
hits
the
mark
with
a
felicity
that
is
almost
his
own
in
this
generation
he
is
terse
concentrated
and
free
from
the
important
blunder
of
mistaking
intellectual
dawdling
for
meditation
nor
in
fine
does
his
abruptness
ever
impede
a
true
urbanity
the
accent
is
homely
and
the
apparel
plain
but
his
bearing
has
a
friendliness
a
courtesy
a
hospitable
humanity
which
goes
nearer
to
our
hearts
than
either
literary
decoration
or
rhetorical
unction
that
modest
and
lenient
which
gave
such
charm
to
his
companionship
breathes
in
his
gravest
writing
and
prevents
us
from
finding
any
page
of
it
cold
or
hard
or
dry
whipple
the
american
critic
wrote
soon
after
death
but
and
light
are
precious
and
inspiring
only
so
far
as
they
express
the
essential
sweetness
of
the
disposition
of
the
thinker
and
the
essential
illuminating
power
of
his
intelligence
emerson
greatness
came
from
his
character
sweetness
and
light
streamed
from
him
because
they
were
him
in
everything
he
thought
wrote
and
did
we
feel
the
presence
of
a
personality
as
vigorous
and
brave
as
it
was
sweet
and
the
particular
radical
thought
he
at
any
time
expressed
derived
its
power
to
animate
and
illuminate
other
minds
from
the
might
of
the
manhood
which
was
felt
to
be
within
and
behind
it
to
and
light
he
therefore
added
the
prime
quality
of
fearless
manliness
if
the
force
of
emerson
character
was
thus
inextricably
blended
with
the
force
of
all
his
faculties
of
intellect
and
imagination
and
the
refinement
of
all
his
sentiments
we
have
still
to
account
for
the
peculiarities
of
his
genius
and
to
answer
the
question
why
do
we
instinctively
apply
the
epithet
to
every
characteristic
passage
in
his
writings
we
are
told
that
he
was
the
last
in
a
long
line
of
clergymen
his
ancestors
and
that
the
modern
doctrine
of
heredity
accounts
for
the
impressive
emphasis
he
laid
on
the
moral
sentiment
but
that
does
not
solve
the
puzzle
why
he
unmistakably
differed
in
his
nature
and
genius
from
all
other
emersons
an
imaginary
genealogical
chart
of
descent
connecting
him
with
confucius
or
gautama
would
be
more
satisfactory
what
distinguishes
emerson
was
his
exceptional
genius
and
character
that
something
in
him
which
separated
him
from
all
other
emersons
as
it
separated
him
from
all
other
eminent
men
of
letters
and
impressed
every
intelligent
reader
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
only
but
aboriginal
some
traits
of
his
mind
and
character
may
be
traced
back
to
his
ancestors
but
what
doctrine
of
heredity
can
give
us
the
genesis
of
his
genius
indeed
the
safest
course
to
pursue
is
to
quote
his
own
words
and
despairingly
confess
that
it
is
the
nature
of
genius
spring
like
the
rainbow
daughter
of
wonder
from
the
invisible
to
abolish
the
past

refuse

this

the

chapter
of
the
phi

kappa
society
a
college
fraternity
composed
of
the
first
men
in

the

has
annual

which
have
been
the
occasion
for
addresses
from
the
most
distinguished
scholars
and
thinkers
of
the
day
president
and
gentlemen
i
greet
you
on
the
recommencement
of
our
literary
year
our
anniversary
is
one
of
hope
and
perhaps
not
enough
of
labor
we
do
not
meet
for
games
of
strength
or
skill
for
the
recitation
of
histories
tragedies
and
odes
like
the
ancient
greeks
for
parliaments
of
love
and
poesy
like
the
troubadours
nor
for
the
advancement
of
science
like
our
in
the
british
and
european
capitals
thus
far
our
holiday
has
been
simply
a
friendly
sign
of
the
survival
of
the
love
of
letters
amongst
a
people
too
busy
to
give
to
letters
any
more
as
such
it
is
precious
as
the
sign
of
an
indestructible
instinct
perhaps
the
time
is
already
come
when
it
ought
to
be
and
will
be
something
else
when
the
sluggard
intellect
of
this
continent
will
look
from
under
its
iron
lids
and
fill
the
postponed
expectation
of
the
world
with
something
better
than
the
exertions
of
mechanical
skill
our
day
of
dependence
our
long
apprenticeship
to
the
learning
of
other
lands
draws
to
a
close
the
millions
that
around
us
are
rushing
into
life
can
not
always
be
fed
on
the
sere
remains
of
foreign

events
actions
arise
that
must
be
sung
that
will
sing
themselves
who
can
doubt
that
poetry
will
revive
and
lead
in
a
new
age
as
the

in
the

now

in

light
of
this
hope
i
accept
the
topic
which
not
only
usage
but
the
nature
of
our
association
seem
to
prescribe
to
this
day
the
american
scholar
year
by
year
we
come
up
hither
to
read
one
more
chapter
of
his
biography
let
us
inquire
what
new
lights
new
events
and
more
days
have
thrown
on
his
character
his
duties
and
his
hopes
it
is
one
of
those
fables
which
out
of
an
unknown
antiquity
convey
an
wisdom
that
the
gods
in
the
beginning
divided
man
into
men
that
he
might
be
more
helpful
to
himself
just
as
the
hand
was
divided
into
fingers
the
better
to
answer
its
end
the
old
fable
covers
a
doctrine
ever
new
and
sublime
that
there
is
one
man
present
to
all
particular
men
only
partially
or
through
one
faculty
and
that
you
must
take
the
whole
society
to
find
the
whole
man
man
is
not
a
farmer
or
a
professor
or
an
engineer
but
he
is
all
man
is
priest
and
scholar
and
statesman
and
producer
and
soldier
in
the
or
social
state
these
functions
are
parceled
out
to
individuals
each
of
whom
aims
to
do
his
stint
of
the
joint
work
whilst
each
other
performs
his
the
fable
implies
that
the
individual
to
possess
himself
must
sometimes
return
from
his
own
labor
to
embrace
all
the
other
laborers
but
unfortunately
this
original
unit
this
fountain
of
power
has
been
so
distributed
to
multitudes
has
been
so
minutely
subdivided
and
peddled
out
that
it
is
spilled
into
drops
and
can
not
be
gathered
the
state
of
society
is
one
in
which
the
members
have
suffered
amputation
from
the
trunk
and
strut
about
so
many
walking
monsters
a
good
finger
a
neck
a
stomach
an
elbow
but
never
a
man
man
is
thus
metamorphosed
into
a
thing
into
many
things
the
planter
who
is
man
sent
out
into
the
field
to
gather
food
is
seldom
cheered
by
any
idea
of
the
true
dignity
of
his
ministry
he
sees
his
bushel
and
his
cart
and
nothing
beyond
and
sinks
into
the
farmer
instead
of
man
on
the
farm
the
tradesman
scarcely
ever
gives
an
ideal
worth
to
his
work
but
is
ridden
by
the
routine
of
his
craft
and
the
soul
is
subject
to
dollars
the
priest
becomes
a
form
the
attorney
a
the
mechanic
a
machine
the
sailor
a
rope
of
the
ship
in
this
distribution
of
functions
the
scholar
is
the
delegated
intellect
in
the
right
state
he
is
in
the
degenerate
state
when
the
victim
of
society
he
tends
to
become
a
mere
thinker
or
still
worse
the
parrot
of
other
men
thinking
in
this
view
of
him
as
man
thinking
the
whole
theory
of
his
office
is
contained
him
nature
solicits
with
all
her
placid
all
her
monitory
pictures
him
the
past
instructs
him
the
future
invites
is
not
indeed
every
man
a
student
and
do
not
all
things
exist
for
the
student
behoof
and
finally
is
not
the
true
scholar
the
only
true
master
but
as
the
old
oracle
said
all
things
have
two
handles
beware
of
the
wrong
one
in
life
too
often
the
scholar
errs
with
mankind
and
forfeits
his
privilege
let
us
see
him
in
his
school
and
consider
him
in
reference
to
the
main
influences
he
receives
i
the
first
in
time
and
the
first
in
importance
of
the
influences
upon
the
mind
is
that
of
nature
every
day
the
sun
and
after
sunset
night
and
her
stars
ever
the
winds
blow
ever
the
grass
grows
every
day
men
and
women
conversing
beholding
and
beholden
the
scholar
must
needs
stand
wistful
and
admiring
before
this
great
spectacle
he
must
settle
its
value
in
his
mind
what
is
nature
to
him
there
is
never
a
beginning
there
is
never
an
end
to
the
inexplicable
continuity
of
this
web
of
god
but
always
circular
power
returning
into
itself
therein
it
resembles
his
own
spirit
whose
beginning
whose
ending
he
never
can
find
so
entire
so
boundless
far
too
as
her
splendors
shine
system
on
system
shooting
like
rays
upward
downward
without
center
without
circumference
in
the
mass
and
in
the
particle
nature
hastens
to
render
account
of
herself
to
the
mind
classification
begins
to
the
young
mind
everything
is
individual
stands
by
itself
by
and
by
it
finds
how
to
join
two
things
and
see
in
them
one
nature
then
three
then
three
thousand
and
so
tyrannized
over
by
its
own
unifying
instinct
it
goes
on
tying
things
together
diminishing
anomalies
discovering
roots
running
under
ground
whereby
contrary
and
remote
things
cohere
and
flower
out
from
one
stem
it
presently
learns
that
since
the
dawn
of
history
there
has
been
a
constant
accumulation
and
classifying
of
facts
but
what
is
classification
but
the
perceiving
that
these
objects
are
not
chaotic
and
are
not
foreign
but
have
a
law
which
is
also
a
law
of
the
human
mind
the
astronomer
discovers
that
geometry
a
pure
abstraction
of
the
human
mind
is
the
measure
of
planetary
motion
the
chemist
finds
proportions
and
intelligible
method
throughout
matter
and
science
is
nothing
but
the
finding
of
analogy
identity
in
the
most
remote
parts
the
ambitious
soul
sits
down
before
each
refractory
fact
one
after
another
reduces
all
strange
constitutions
all
new
powers
to
their
class
and
their
law
and
goes
on
forever
to
animate
the
last
fiber
of
organization
the
outskirts
of
nature
by
insight
thus
to
him
to
this
under
the
bending
dome
of
day
is
suggested
that
he
and
it
proceed
from
one
root
one
is
leaf
and
one
is
flower
relation
sympathy
stirring
in
every
vein
and
what
is
that
root
is
not
that
the
soul
of
his
soul
a
thought
too
bold
a
dream
too
wild
yet
when
this
spiritual
light
shall
have
revealed
the
law
of
more
earthly
natures
when
he
has
learned
to
worship
the
soul
and
to
see
that
the
natural
philosophy
that
now
is
is
only
the
first
gropings
of
its
gigantic
hand
he
shall
look
forward
to
an
knowledge
as
to
a
becoming
creator
he
shall
see
that
nature
is
the
opposite
of
the
soul
answering
to
it
part
for
part
one
is
seal
and
one
is
print
its
beauty
is
the
beauty
of
his
own
mind
its
laws
are
the
laws
of
his
own
mind
nature
then
becomes
to
him
the
measure
of
his
attainments
so
much
of
nature
as
he
is
ignorant
of
so
much
of
his
own
mind
does
he
not
yet
possess
and
in
fine
the
ancient
precept
know
thyself
and
the
modern
precept
study
nature
become
at
last
one
maxim
ii
the
next
great
influence
into
the
spirit
of
the
scholar
is
the
mind
of
the
past
in
whatever
form
whether
of
literature
of
art
of
institutions
that
mind
is
inscribed
books
are
the
best
type
of
the
influence
of
the
past
and
perhaps
we
shall
get
at
the
truth
learn
the
amount
of
this
influence
more
conveniently
by
considering
their
value
alone
the
theory
of
books
is
noble
the
scholar
of
the
first
age
received
into
him
the
world
around
brooded
thereon
gave
it
the
new
arrangement
of
his
own
mind
and
uttered
it
again
it
came
into
him
life
it
went
out
from
him
truth
it
came
to
him
actions
it
went
out
from
him
immortal
thoughts
it
came
to
him
business
it
went
from
him
poetry
it
was
dead
fact
now
it
is
quick
thought
it
can
stand
and
it
can
go
it
now
endures
it
now
flies
it
now
inspires
precisely
in
proportion
to
the
depth
of
mind
from
which
it
issued
so
high
does
it
soar
so
long
does
it
sing
or
i
might
say
it
depends
on
how
far
the
process
had
gone
of
transmuting
life
into
truth
in
proportion
to
the
completeness
of
the
distillation
so
will
the
purity
and
imperishableness
of
the
product
be
but
none
is
quite
perfect
as
no
can
by
any
means
make
a
perfect
vacuum
so
neither
can
any
artist
entirely
exclude
the
conventional
the
local
the
perishable
from
his
book
or
write
a
book
of
pure
thought
that
shall
be
as
efficient
in
all
respects
to
a
remote
posterity
as
to
contemporaries
or
rather
to
the
second
age
each
age
it
is
found
must
write
its
own
books
or
rather
each
generation
for
the
next
succeeding
the
books
of
an
older
period
will
not
fit
this
yet
hence
arises
a
grave
mischief
the
sacredness
which
attaches
to
the
act
of
creation
the
act
of
thought
is
instantly
transferred
to
the
record
the
poet
chanting
was
felt
to
be
a
divine
man
henceforth
the
chant
is
divine
also
the
writer
was
a
just
and
wise
spirit
henceforward
it
is
settled
the
book
is
perfect
as
love
of
the
hero
corrupts
into
worship
of
his
statue
instantly
the
book
becomes
noxious
the
guide
is
a
tyrant
we
sought
a
brother
and
lo
a
governor
the
sluggish
and
perverted
mind
of
the
multitude
always
slow
to
open
to
the
incursions
of
reason
having
once
so
opened
having
once
received
this
book
stands
upon
it
and
makes
an
outcry
if
it
is
disparaged
colleges
are
built
on
it
books
are
written
on
it
by
thinkers
not
by
man
thinking
by
men
of
talent
that
is
who
start
wrong
who
set
out
from
accepted
dogmas
not
from
their
own
sight
of
principles
meek
young
men
grow
up
in
libraries
believing
it
their
duty
to
accept
the
views
which
cicero
which
locke
which
bacon
have
given
forgetful
that
cicero
locke
and
bacon
were
only
young
men
in
libraries
when
they
wrote
these
books
hence
instead
of
man
thinking
we
have
the
bookworm
hence
the
class
who
value
books
as
such
not
as
related
to
nature
and
the
human
constitution
but
as
making
a
sort
of
third
estate
with
the
world
and
soul
hence
the
restorers
of
readings
the
emendators
the
bibliomaniacs
of
all
degrees
this
is
bad
this
is
worse
than
it
seems
books
are
the
best
of
things
well
used
abused
among
the
worst
what
is
the
right
use
what
is
the
one
end
which
all
means
go
to
effect
they
are
for
nothing
but
to
inspire
i
had
better
never
see
a
book
than
to
be
warped
by
its
attraction
clean
out
of
my
own
orbit
and
made
a
satellite
instead
of
a
system
the
one
thing
in
the
world
of
value
is
the
active
soul
the
soul
free
sovereign
active
this
every
man
is
entitled
to
this
every
man
contains
within
him
although
in
almost
all
men
obstructed
and
as
yet
unborn
the
soul
active
sees
absolute
truth
and
utters
truth
or
creates
in
this
action
it
is
genius
not
the
privilege
of
here
and
there
a
favorite
but
the
sound
estate
of
every
man
in
its
essence
it
is
progressive
the
book
the
college
the
school
of
art
the
institution
of
any
kind
stop
with
some
past
utterance
of
genius
this
is
good
say
they
let
us
hold
by
this
they
pin
me
down
they
look
backward
and
not
forward
but
genius
always
looks
forward
the
eyes
of
man
are
set
in
his
forehead
not
in
his
hindhead
man
hopes
genius
creates
to
create
to
create
is
the
proof
of
a
divine
presence
whatever
talents
may
be
if
the
man
create
not
the
pure
efflux
of
the
deity
is
not
his
cinders
and
smoke
there
may
be
but
not
yet
flame
there
are
creative
manners
there
are
creative
actions
and
creative
words
manners
actions
words
that
is
indicative
of
no
custom
or
authority
but
springing
spontaneous
from
the
mind
own
sense
of
good
and
fair
on
the
other
part
instead
of
being
its
own
seer
let
it
receive
always
from
another
mind
its
truth
though
it
were
in
torrents
of
light
without
periods
of
solitude
inquest
and
and
a
fatal
disservice
is
done
genius
is
always
sufficiently
the
enemy
of
genius
by
the
literature
of
every
nation
bear
me
witness
the
english
dramatic
poets
have
shakespearized
now
for
two
hundred
years
undoubtedly
there
is
a
right
way
of
reading
so
it
be
sternly
subordinated
man
thinking
must
not
be
subdued
by
his
instruments
books
are
for
the
scholar
idle
times
when
he
can
read
god
directly
the
hour
is
too
precious
to
be
wasted
in
other
men
transcripts
of
their
readings
but
when
the
intervals
of
darkness
come
as
come
they
must
when
the
soul
seeth
not
when
the
sun
is
hid
and
the
stars
withdraw
their
shining
we
repair
to
the
lamps
which
were
kindled
by
their
ray
to
guide
our
steps
to
the
east
again
where
the
dawn
is
we
hear
that
we
may
speak
the
arabian
proverb
says
a
looking
on
a
becometh
fruitful
it
is
remarkable
the
character
of
the
pleasure
we
derive
from
the
best
books
they
impress
us
ever
with
the
conviction
that
one
nature
wrote
and
the
same
reads
we
read
the
verses
of
one
of
the
great
english
poets
of
chaucer
of
marvell
of
dryden
with
the
most
modern
joy
with
a
pleasure
i
mean
which
is
in
great
part
caused
by
the
abstraction
of
all
from
their
verses
there
is
some
awe
mixed
with
the
joy
of
our
surprise
when
this
poet
who
lived
in
some
past
world
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
says
that
which
lies
close
to
my
own
soul
that
which
i
also
had
thought
and
said
but
for
the
evidence
thence
afforded
to
the
philosophical
doctrine
of
the
identity
of
all
minds
we
should
suppose
some
harmony
some
foresight
of
souls
that
were
to
be
and
some
preparation
of
stores
for
their
future
wants
like
the
fact
observed
in
insects
who
lay
up
food
before
death
for
the
young
grub
they
shall
never
see
i
would
not
be
hurried
by
any
love
of
system
by
any
exaggeration
of
instincts
to
underrate
the
book
we
all
know
that
as
the
human
body
can
be
nourished
on
any
food
though
it
were
boiled
grass
and
the
broth
of
shoes
so
the
human
mind
can
be
fed
by
any
knowledge
and
great
and
heroic
men
have
existed
who
had
almost
no
other
information
than
by
the
printed
page
i
only
would
say
that
it
needs
a
strong
head
to
bear
that
diet
one
must
be
an
inventor
to
read
well
as
the
proverb
says
he
that
would
bring
home
the
wealth
of
the
indies
must
carry
out
the
wealth
of
the
indies
there
is
then
creative
reading
as
well
as
creative
writing
when
the
mind
is
braced
by
labor
and
invention
the
page
of
whatever
book
we
read
becomes
luminous
with
manifold
allusion
every
sentence
is
doubly
significant
and
the
sense
of
our
author
is
as
broad
as
the
world
we
then
see
what
is
always
true
that
as
the
seer
hour
of
vision
is
short
and
rare
among
heavy
days
and
months
so
is
its
record
perchance
the
least
part
of
his
volume
the
discerning
will
read
in
his
plato
or
shakespeare
only
that
least
part
only
the
authentic
utterances
of
the
oracle
all
the
rest
he
rejects
were
it
never
so
many
times
and
shakespeare
of
course
there
is
a
portion
of
reading
quite
indispensable
to
a
wise
man
history
and
exact
science
he
must
learn
by
laborious
reading
colleges
in
like
manner
have
their
indispensable
office
to
teach
elements
but
they
can
only
highly
serve
us
when
they
aim
not
to
drill
but
to
create
when
they
gather
from
far
every
ray
of
various
genius
to
their
hospitable
halls
and
by
the
concentrated
fires
set
the
hearts
of
their
youth
on
flame
thought
and
knowledge
are
natures
in
which
apparatus
and
pretension
avail
nothing
gowns
and
pecuniary
foundations
though
of
towns
of
gold
can
never
countervail
the
least
sentence
or
syllable
of
wit
forget
this
and
our
american
colleges
will
recede
in
their
public
importance
whilst
they
grow
richer
every
year
iii
there
goes
in
the
world
a
notion
that
the
scholar
should
be
a
recluse
a
valetudinarian
as
unfit
for
any
handiwork
or
public
labor
as
a
penknife
for
an
axe
the
practical
men
sneer
at
speculative
men
as
if
because
they
speculate
or
they
could
do
nothing
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
clergy
who
are
always
more
universally
than
any
other
class
the
scholars
of
their
day
are
addressed
as
women
that
the
rough
spontaneous
conversation
of
men
they
do
not
hear
but
only
a
mincing
and
diluted
speech
they
are
often
virtually
disfranchised
and
indeed
there
are
advocates
for
their
celibacy
as
far
as
this
is
true
of
the
studious
classes
it
is
not
just
and
wise
action
is
with
the
scholar
subordinate
but
it
is
essential
without
it
he
is
not
yet
man
without
it
thought
can
never
ripen
into
truth
whilst
the
world
hangs
before
the
eye
as
a
cloud
of
beauty
we
can
not
even
see
its
beauty
inaction
is
cowardice
but
there
can
be
no
scholar
without
the
heroic
mind
the
preamble
of
thought
the
transition
through
which
it
passes
from
the
unconscious
to
the
conscious
is
action
only
so
much
do
i
know
as
i
have
lived
instantly
we
know
whose
words
are
loaded
with
life
and
whose
not
the
world
this
shadow
of
the
soul
or
lies
wide
around
its
attractions
are
the
keys
which
unlock
my
thoughts
and
make
me
acquainted
with
myself
i
launch
eagerly
into
this
resounding
tumult
i
grasp
the
hands
of
those
next
me
and
take
my
place
in
the
ring
to
suffer
and
to
work
taught
by
an
instinct
that
so
shall
the
dumb
abyss
be
vocal
with
speech
i
pierce
its
order
i
dissipate
its
fear
i
dispose
of
it
within
the
circuit
of
my
expanding
life
so
much
only
of
life
as
i
know
by
experience
so
much
of
the
wilderness
have
i
vanquished
and
planted
or
so
far
have
i
extended
my
being
my
dominion
i
do
not
see
how
any
man
can
afford
for
the
sake
of
his
nerves
and
his
nap
to
spare
any
action
in
which
he
can
partake
it
is
pearls
and
rubies
to
his
discourse
drudgery
calamity
exasperation
want
are
instructors
in
eloquence
and
wisdom
the
true
scholar
grudges
every
opportunity
of
action
passed
by
as
a
loss
of
power
it
is
the
raw
material
out
of
which
the
intellect
molds
her
splendid
products
a
strange
process
too
this
by
which
experience
is
converted
into
thought
as
a
is
converted
into
satin
the
manufacture
goes
forward
at
all
hours
the
actions
and
events
of
our
childhood
and
youth
are
now
matters
of
calmest
observation
they
lie
like
fair
pictures
in
the
air
not
so
with
our
recent
actions
with
the
business
which
we
now
have
in
hand
on
this
we
are
quite
unable
to
speculate
our
affections
as
yet
circulate
through
it
we
no
more
feel
or
know
it
than
we
feel
the
feet
or
the
hand
or
the
brain
of
our
body
the
new
deed
is
yet
a
part
of
life
remains
for
a
time
immersed
in
our
unconscious
life
in
some
contemplative
hour
it
detaches
itself
from
the
life
like
a
ripe
fruit
to
become
a
thought
of
the
mind
instantly
it
is
raised
transfigured
the
corruptible
has
put
on
incorruption
henceforth
it
is
an
object
of
beauty
however
base
its
origin
and
neighborhood
observe
too
the
impossibility
of
antedating
this
act
in
its
grub
state
it
can
not
fly
it
can
not
shine
it
is
a
dull
grub
but
suddenly
without
observation
the
selfsame
thing
unfurls
beautiful
wings
and
is
an
angel
of
wisdom
so
is
there
no
fact
no
event
in
our
private
history
which
shall
not
sooner
or
later
lose
its
adhesive
inert
form
and
astonish
us
by
soaring
from
our
body
into
the
empyrean
cradle
and
infancy
school
and
playground
the
fear
of
boys
and
dogs
and
ferules
the
love
of
little
maids
and
berries
and
many
another
fact
that
once
filled
the
whole
sky
are
gone
already
friend
and
relative
profession
and
party
town
and
country
nation
and
world
must
also
soar
and
sing
of
course
he
who
has
put
forth
his
total
strength
in
fit
actions
has
the
richest
return
of
wisdom
i
will
not
shut
myself
out
of
this
globe
of
action
and
transplant
an
oak
into
a
there
to
hunger
and
pine
nor
trust
the
revenue
of
some
single
faculty
and
exhaust
one
vein
of
thought
much
like
those
savoyards
who
getting
their
livelihood
by
carving
shepherds
shepherdesses
and
smoking
dutchmen
for
all
europe
went
out
one
day
to
the
mountain
to
find
stock
and
discovered
that
they
had
whittled
up
the
last
of
their
authors
we
have
in
numbers
who
have
written
out
their
vein
and
who
moved
by
a
commendable
prudence
sail
for
greece
or
palestine
follow
the
trapper
into
the
prairie
or
ramble
round
algiers
to
replenish
their
merchantable
stock
if
it
were
only
for
a
vocabulary
the
scholar
would
be
covetous
of
action
life
is
our
dictionary
years
are
well
spent
in
country
labors
in
town
in
the
insight
into
trades
and
manufactures
in
frank
intercourse
with
many
men
and
women
in
science
in
art
to
the
one
end
of
mastering
in
all
their
facts
a
language
by
which
to
illustrate
and
embody
our
perceptions
i
learn
immediately
from
any
speaker
how
much
he
has
already
lived
through
the
poverty
or
the
splendor
of
his
speech
life
lies
behind
us
as
the
quarry
from
whence
we
get
tiles
and
copestones
for
the
masonry
of
this
is
the
way
to
learn
grammar
colleges
and
books
only
copy
the
language
which
the
field
and
the
made
but
the
final
value
of
action
like
that
of
books
and
better
than
books
is
that
it
is
a
resource
that
great
principle
of
undulation
in
nature
that
shows
itself
in
the
inspiring
and
expiring
of
the
breath
in
desire
and
satiety
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
in
day
and
night
in
heat
and
cold
and
as
yet
more
deeply
ingrained
in
every
atom
and
every
fluid
is
known
to
us
under
the
name
of
polarity
these
fits
of
easy
transmission
and
reflection
as
newton
called
them
are
the
law
of
nature
because
they
are
the
law
of
spirit
the
mind
now
thinks
now
acts
and
each
fit
reproduces
the
other
when
the
artist
has
exhausted
his
materials
when
the
fancy
no
longer
paints
when
thoughts
are
no
longer
apprehended
and
books
are
a
weariness
he
has
always
the
resource
character
is
higher
than
intellect
thinking
is
the
function
living
is
the
functionary
the
stream
retreats
to
its
source
a
great
soul
will
be
strong
to
live
as
well
as
strong
to
think
does
he
lack
organ
or
medium
to
impart
his
truth
he
can
still
fall
back
on
this
elemental
force
of
living
them
this
is
a
total
act
thinking
is
a
partial
act
let
the
grandeur
of
justice
shine
in
his
affairs
let
the
beauty
of
affection
cheer
his
lowly
roof
those
far
from
fame
who
dwell
and
act
with
him
will
feel
the
force
of
his
constitution
in
the
doings
and
passages
of
the
day
better
than
it
can
be
measured
by
any
public
and
designed
display
time
shall
teach
him
that
the
scholar
loses
no
hour
which
the
man
lives
herein
he
unfolds
the
sacred
germ
of
his
instinct
screened
from
influence
what
is
lost
in
seemliness
is
gained
in
strength
not
out
of
those
on
whom
systems
of
education
have
exhausted
their
culture
comes
the
helpful
giant
to
destroy
the
old
or
to
build
the
new
but
out
of
unhandselled
savage
nature
out
of
terrible
druids
and
berserkers
come
at
last
alfred
and
shakespeare
i
hear
therefore
with
joy
whatever
is
beginning
to
be
said
of
the
dignity
and
necessity
of
labor
to
every
citizen
there
is
virtue
yet
in
the
hoe
and
the
spade
for
learned
as
well
as
for
unlearned
hands
and
labor
is
everywhere
welcome
always
we
are
invited
to
work
only
be
this
limitation
observed
that
a
man
shall
not
for
the
sake
of
wider
activity
sacrifice
any
opinion
to
the
popular
judgments
and
modes
of
action
i
have
now
spoken
of
the
education
of
the
scholar
by
nature
by
books
and
by
action
it
remains
to
say
somewhat
of
his
duties
they
are
such
as
become
man
thinking
they
may
all
be
comprised
in
the
office
of
the
scholar
is
to
cheer
to
raise
and
to
guide
men
by
showing
them
facts
amidst
appearances
he
plies
the
slow
unhonored
and
unpaid
task
of
observation
flamsteed
and
herschel
in
their
glazed
observatories
may
catalogue
the
stars
with
the
praise
of
all
men
and
the
results
being
splendid
and
useful
honor
is
sure
but
he
in
his
private
observatory
cataloguing
obscure
and
nebulous
stars
of
the
human
mind
which
as
yet
no
man
has
thought
of
as
such
watching
days
and
months
sometimes
for
a
few
facts
correcting
still
his
old
records
must
relinquish
display
and
immediate
fame
in
the
long
period
of
his
preparation
he
must
betray
often
an
ignorance
and
shiftlessness
in
popular
arts
incurring
the
disdain
of
the
able
who
shoulder
him
aside
long
he
must
stammer
in
his
speech
often
forego
the
living
for
the
dead
worse
yet
he
must
accept
how
often
poverty
and
solitude
for
the
ease
and
pleasure
of
treading
the
old
road
accepting
the
fashions
the
education
the
religion
of
society
he
takes
the
cross
of
making
his
own
and
of
course
the
the
faint
heart
the
frequent
uncertainty
and
loss
of
time
which
are
the
nettles
and
tangling
vines
in
the
way
of
the
and
and
the
state
of
virtual
hostility
in
which
he
seems
to
stand
to
society
and
especially
to
educated
society
for
all
this
loss
and
scorn
what
offset
he
is
to
find
consolation
in
exercising
the
highest
functions
of
human
nature
he
is
one
who
raises
himself
from
private
considerations
and
breathes
and
lives
on
public
and
illustrious
thoughts
he
is
the
world
eye
he
is
the
world
heart
he
is
to
resist
the
vulgar
prosperity
that
retrogrades
ever
to
barbarism
by
preserving
and
communicating
heroic
sentiments
noble
biographies
melodious
verse
and
the
conclusions
of
history
whatsoever
oracles
the
human
heart
in
all
emergencies
in
all
solemn
hours
has
uttered
as
its
commentary
on
the
world
of
actions
these
he
shall
receive
and
impart
and
whatsoever
new
verdict
reason
from
her
inviolable
seat
pronounces
on
the
passing
men
and
events
of
this
he
shall
hear
and
promulgate
these
being
his
functions
it
becomes
him
to
feel
all
confidence
in
himself
and
to
defer
never
to
the
popular
cry
he
and
he
only
knows
the
world
the
world
of
any
moment
is
the
merest
appearance
some
great
decorum
some
fetich
of
a
government
some
ephemeral
trade
or
war
or
man
is
cried
up
by
half
mankind
and
cried
down
by
the
other
half
as
if
all
depended
on
this
particular
up
or
down
the
odds
are
that
the
whole
question
is
not
worth
the
poorest
thought
which
the
scholar
has
lost
in
listening
to
the
controversy
let
him
not
quit
his
belief
that
a
popgun
is
a
popgun
though
the
ancient
and
honorable
of
the
earth
affirm
it
to
be
the
crack
of
doom
in
silence
in
steadiness
in
severe
abstraction
let
him
hold
by
himself
add
observation
to
observation
patient
of
neglect
patient
of
reproach
and
bide
his
own
time
happy
enough
if
he
can
satisfy
himself
alone
that
this
day
he
has
seen
something
truly
success
treads
on
every
right
step
for
the
instinct
is
sure
that
prompts
him
to
tell
his
brother
what
he
thinks
he
then
learns
that
in
going
down
into
the
secrets
of
his
own
mind
he
has
descended
into
the
secrets
of
all
minds
he
learns
that
he
who
has
mastered
any
law
in
his
private
thoughts
is
master
to
that
extent
of
all
men
whose
language
he
speaks
and
of
all
into
whose
language
his
own
can
be
translated
the
poet
in
utter
solitude
remembering
his
spontaneous
thoughts
and
recording
them
is
found
to
have
recorded
that
which
men
in
cities
vast
find
true
for
them
also
the
orator
distrusts
at
first
the
fitness
of
his
frank
confessions
his
want
of
knowledge
of
the
persons
he
addresses
until
he
finds
that
he
is
the
complement
of
his
hearers
that
they
drink
his
words
because
he
fulfills
for
them
their
own
nature
the
deeper
he
dives
into
his
privatest
secretest
presentiment
to
his
wonder
he
finds
this
is
the
most
acceptable
most
public
and
universally
true
the
people
delight
in
it
the
better
part
of
every
man
feels
this
is
my
music
this
is
myself
in
all
the
virtues
are
comprehended
free
should
the
scholar
be
free
and
brave
free
even
to
the
definition
of
freedom
without
any
hindrance
that
does
not
arise
out
of
his
own
constitution
brave
for
fear
is
a
thing
which
a
scholar
by
his
very
function
puts
behind
him
fear
always
springs
from
ignorance
it
is
a
shame
to
him
if
his
tranquility
amid
dangerous
times
arise
from
the
presumption
that
like
children
and
women
his
is
a
protected
class
or
if
he
seek
a
temporary
peace
by
the
diversion
of
his
thoughts
from
politics
or
vexed
questions
hiding
his
head
like
an
ostrich
in
the
flowering
bushes
peeping
into
microscopes
and
turning
rhymes
as
a
boy
whistles
to
keep
his
courage
up
so
is
the
danger
a
danger
still
so
is
the
fear
worse
manlike
let
him
turn
and
face
it
let
him
look
into
its
eye
and
search
its
nature
inspect
its
origin
see
the
whelping
of
this
lion
which
lies
no
great
way
back
he
will
then
find
in
himself
a
perfect
comprehension
of
its
nature
and
extent
he
will
have
made
his
hands
meet
on
the
other
side
and
can
henceforth
defy
it
and
pass
on
superior
the
world
is
his
who
can
see
through
its
pretension
what
deafness
what
custom
what
overgrown
error
you
behold
is
there
only
by
sufferance
by
your
sufferance
see
it
to
be
a
lie
and
you
have
already
dealt
it
its
mortal
blow
yes
we
are
the
cowed
we
the
trustless
it
is
a
mischievous
notion
that
we
are
come
late
into
nature
that
the
world
was
finished
a
long
time
ago
as
the
world
was
plastic
and
fluid
in
the
hands
of
god
so
it
is
ever
to
so
much
of
his
attributes
as
we
bring
to
it
to
ignorance
and
sin
it
is
flint
they
adapt
themselves
to
it
as
they
may
but
in
proportion
as
a
man
has
any
thing
in
him
divine
the
firmament
flows
before
him
and
takes
his
signet
and
form
not
he
is
great
who
can
alter
matter
but
he
who
can
alter
my
state
of
mind
they
are
the
kings
of
the
world
who
give
the
color
of
their
present
thought
to
all
nature
and
all
art
and
persuade
men
by
the
cheerful
serenity
of
their
carrying
the
matter
that
this
thing
which
they
do
is
the
apple
which
the
ages
have
desired
to
pluck
now
at
last
ripe
and
inviting
nations
to
the
harvest
the
great
man
makes
the
great
thing
wherever
macdonald
sits
there
is
the
head
of
the
table
linnæus
makes
botany
the
most
alluring
of
studies
and
wins
it
from
the
farmer
and
the
davy
chemistry
and
cuvier
fossils
the
day
is
always
his
who
works
in
it
with
serenity
and
great
aims
the
unstable
estimates
of
men
crowd
to
him
whose
mind
is
filled
with
a
truth
as
the
heaped
waves
of
the
atlantic
follow
the
moon
for
this
the
reason
is
deeper
than
can
be
fathomed
darker
than
can
be
enlightened
i
might
not
carry
with
me
the
feeling
of
my
audience
in
stating
my
own
belief
but
i
have
already
shown
the
ground
of
my
hope
in
adverting
to
the
doctrine
that
man
is
one
i
believe
man
has
been
wronged
he
has
wronged
himself
he
has
almost
lost
the
light
that
can
lead
him
back
to
his
prerogatives
men
are
become
of
no
account
men
in
history
men
in
the
world
of
are
bugs
are
spawn
and
are
called
the
mass
and
the
herd
in
a
century
in
a
millennium
one
or
two
men
that
is
to
say
one
or
two
approximations
to
the
right
state
of
every
man
all
the
rest
behold
in
the
hero
or
the
poet
their
own
green
and
crude
being
ripened
yes
and
are
content
to
be
less
so
may
attain
to
its
full
stature
what
a
testimony
full
of
grandeur
full
of
pity
is
borne
to
the
demands
of
his
own
nature
by
the
poor
clansman
the
poor
partisan
who
rejoices
in
the
glory
of
his
chief
the
poor
and
the
low
find
some
amends
to
their
immense
moral
capacity
for
their
acquiescence
in
a
political
and
social
inferiority
they
are
content
to
be
brushed
like
flies
from
the
path
of
a
great
person
so
that
justice
shall
be
done
by
him
to
that
common
nature
which
it
is
the
dearest
desire
of
all
to
see
enlarged
and
glorified
they
sun
themselves
in
the
great
man
light
and
feel
it
to
be
their
own
element
they
cast
the
dignity
of
man
from
their
downtrod
selves
upon
the
shoulders
of
a
hero
and
will
perish
to
add
one
drop
of
blood
to
make
that
great
heart
beat
those
giant
sinews
combat
and
conquer
he
lives
for
us
and
we
live
in
him
men
such
as
they
are
very
naturally
seek
money
or
power
and
power
because
it
is
as
good
as
money
the
spoils
so
called
of
office
and
why
not
for
they
aspire
to
the
highest
and
this
in
their
they
dream
is
highest
wake
them
and
they
shall
quit
the
false
good
and
leap
to
the
true
and
leave
governments
to
clerks
and
desks
this
revolution
is
to
be
wrought
by
the
gradual
domestication
of
the
idea
of
culture
the
main
enterprise
of
the
world
for
splendor
for
extent
is
the
upbuilding
of
a
man
here
are
the
materials
strewn
along
the
ground
the
private
life
of
one
man
shall
be
a
more
illustrious
monarchy
more
formidable
to
its
enemy
more
sweet
and
serene
in
its
influence
to
its
friend
than
any
kingdom
in
history
for
a
man
rightly
viewed
comprehendeth
the
particular
natures
of
all
men
each
philosopher
each
bard
each
actor
has
only
done
for
me
as
by
a
delegate
what
one
day
i
can
do
for
myself
the
books
which
once
we
valued
more
than
the
apple
of
the
eye
we
have
quite
exhausted
what
is
that
but
saying
that
we
have
come
up
with
the
point
of
view
which
the
universal
mind
took
through
the
eyes
of
one
scribe
we
have
been
that
man
and
have
passed
on
first
one
then
another
we
drain
all
cisterns
and
waxing
greater
by
all
these
supplies
we
crave
a
better
and
a
more
abundant
food
the
man
has
never
lived
that
can
feed
us
ever
the
human
mind
can
not
be
enshrined
in
a
person
who
shall
set
a
barrier
on
any
one
side
to
this
unbounded
unboundable
empire
it
is
one
central
fire
which
flaming
now
out
of
the
lips
of
etna
lightens
the
capes
of
sicily
and
now
out
of
the
throat
of
vesuvius
illuminates
the
towers
and
vineyards
of
naples
it
is
one
light
which
beams
out
of
a
thousand
stars
it
is
one
soul
which
animates
all
men
but
i
have
dwelt
perhaps
tediously
upon
this
abstraction
of
the
scholar
i
ought
not
to
delay
longer
to
add
what
i
have
to
say
of
nearer
reference
to
the
time
and
to
this
country
historically
there
is
thought
to
be
a
difference
in
the
ideas
which
predominate
over
successive
epochs
and
there
are
data
for
marking
the
genius
of
the
classic
of
the
romantic
and
now
of
the
reflective
or
philosophical
age
with
the
views
i
have
intimated
of
the
oneness
or
the
identity
of
the
mind
through
all
individuals
i
do
not
much
dwell
on
these
differences
in
fact
i
believe
each
individual
passes
through
all
three
the
boy
is
a
greek
the
youth
romantic
the
adult
reflective
i
deny
not
however
that
a
revolution
in
the
leading
idea
may
be
distinctly
enough
traced
our
age
is
bewailed
as
the
age
of
introversion
must
that
needs
be
evil
we
it
seems
are
critical
we
are
embarrassed
with
second
thoughts
we
can
not
enjoy
anything
for
hankering
to
know
whereof
the
pleasure
consists
we
are
lined
with
eyes
we
see
with
our
feet
the
time
is
infected
with
hamlet
unhappiness
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
is
it
so
bad
then
sight
is
the
last
thing
to
be
pitied
would
we
be
blind
do
we
fear
lest
we
should
outsee
nature
and
god
and
drink
truth
dry
i
look
upon
the
discontent
of
the
literary
class
as
a
mere
announcement
of
the
fact
that
they
find
themselves
not
in
the
state
of
mind
of
their
fathers
and
regret
the
coming
state
as
untried
as
a
boy
dreads
the
water
before
he
has
learned
that
he
can
swim
if
there
is
any
period
one
would
desire
to
be
born
in
is
it
not
the
age
of
revolution
when
the
old
and
the
new
stand
side
by
side
and
admit
of
being
compared
when
the
energies
of
all
men
are
searched
by
fear
and
by
hope
when
the
historic
glories
of
the
old
can
be
compensated
by
the
rich
possibilities
of
the
new
era
this
time
like
all
times
is
a
very
good
one
if
we
but
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
read
with
some
joy
of
the
auspicious
signs
of
the
coming
days
as
they
glimmer
already
through
poetry
and
art
through
philosophy
and
science
through
church
and
state
one
of
these
signs
is
the
fact
that
the
same
movement
which
effected
the
elevation
of
what
was
called
the
lowest
class
in
the
state
assumed
in
literature
a
very
marked
and
as
benign
an
aspect
instead
of
the
sublime
and
beautiful
the
near
the
low
the
common
was
explored
and
poetized
that
which
had
been
negligently
trodden
under
foot
by
those
who
were
harnessing
and
provisioning
themselves
for
long
journeys
into
far
countries
is
suddenly
found
to
be
richer
than
all
foreign
parts
the
literature
of
the
poor
the
feelings
of
the
child
the
philosophy
of
the
street
the
meaning
of
household
life
are
the
topics
of
the
time
it
is
a
great
stride
it
is
a
sign
is
it
not
of
new
vigor
when
the
extremities
are
made
active
when
currents
of
warm
life
run
into
the
hands
and
the
feet
i
ask
not
for
the
great
the
remote
the
romantic
what
is
doing
in
italy
or
arabia
what
is
greek
art
or
provençal
minstrelsy
i
embrace
the
common
i
explore
and
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
familiar
the
low
give
me
insight
into
and
you
may
have
the
antique
and
future
worlds
what
would
we
really
know
the
meaning
of
the
meal
in
the
firkin
the
milk
in
the
pan
the
ballad
in
the
street
the
news
of
the
boat
the
glance
of
the
eye
the
form
and
the
gait
of
the
body
show
me
the
ultimate
reason
of
these
matters
show
me
the
sublime
presence
of
the
highest
spiritual
cause
lurking
as
always
it
does
lurk
in
these
suburbs
and
extremities
of
nature
let
me
see
every
trifle
bristling
with
the
polarity
that
ranges
it
instantly
on
an
eternal
law
and
the
shop
the
plow
and
the
ledger
referred
to
the
like
cause
by
which
light
undulates
and
poets
sing
and
the
world
lies
no
longer
a
dull
miscellany
and
but
has
form
and
order
there
is
no
trifle
there
is
no
puzzle
but
one
design
unites
and
animates
the
farthest
pinnacle
and
the
lowest
trench
this
idea
has
inspired
the
genius
of
goldsmith
burns
cowper
and
in
a
newer
time
of
goethe
wordsworth
and
carlyle
this
idea
they
have
differently
followed
and
with
various
success
in
contrast
with
their
writing
the
style
of
pope
of
johnson
of
gibbon
looks
cold
and
pedantic
this
writing
is
man
is
surprised
to
find
that
things
near
are
not
less
beautiful
and
wondrous
than
things
remote
the
near
explains
the
far
the
drop
is
a
small
ocean
a
man
is
related
to
all
nature
this
perception
of
the
worth
of
the
vulgar
is
fruitful
in
discoveries
goethe
in
this
very
thing
the
most
modern
of
the
moderns
has
shown
us
as
none
ever
did
the
genius
of
the
ancients
there
is
one
man
of
genius
who
has
done
much
for
this
philosophy
of
life
whose
literary
value
has
never
yet
been
rightly
estimated
i
mean
emanuel
swedenborg
the
most
imaginative
of
men
yet
writing
with
the
precision
of
a
mathematician
he
endeavored
to
engraft
a
purely
philosophical
ethics
on
the
popular
christianity
of
his
time
such
an
attempt
of
course
must
have
difficulty
which
no
genius
could
surmount
but
he
saw
and
showed
the
connexion
between
nature
and
the
affections
of
the
soul
he
pierced
the
emblematic
or
spiritual
character
of
the
visible
audible
tangible
world
especially
did
his
muse
hover
over
and
interpret
the
lower
parts
of
nature
he
showed
the
mysterious
bond
that
allies
moral
evil
to
the
foul
material
forms
and
has
given
in
epical
parables
a
theory
of
insanity
of
beasts
of
unclean
and
fearful
things
another
sign
of
our
times
also
marked
by
an
analogous
political
movement
is
the
new
importance
given
to
the
single
person
everything
that
tends
to
insulate
the
individual
to
surround
him
with
barriers
of
natural
respect
so
that
each
man
shall
feel
the
world
is
his
and
man
shall
treat
with
man
as
a
sovereign
state
with
a
sovereign
state
tends
to
true
union
as
well
as
greatness
i
learned
said
the
melancholy
pestalozzi
that
no
man
in
god
wide
earth
is
either
willing
or
able
to
help
any
other
man
help
must
come
from
the
bosom
alone
the
scholar
is
that
man
who
must
take
up
into
himself
all
the
ability
of
the
time
all
the
contributions
of
the
past
all
the
hopes
of
the
future
he
must
be
an
university
of
knowledges
if
there
be
one
lesson
more
than
another
that
should
pierce
his
ear
it
is
the
world
is
nothing
the
man
is
all
in
yourself
is
the
law
of
all
nature
and
you
know
not
yet
how
a
globule
of
sap
ascends
in
yourself
slumbers
the
whole
of
reason
it
is
for
you
to
know
all
it
is
for
you
to
dare
all
president
and
gentlemen
this
confidence
in
the
unsearched
might
of
man
belongs
by
all
motives
by
all
prophecy
by
all
preparation
to
the
american
scholar
we
have
listened
too
long
to
the
courtly
muses
of
europe
the
spirit
of
the
american
freeman
is
already
suspected
to
be
timid
imitative
tame
public
and
private
avarice
make
the
air
we
breathe
thick
and
fat
the
scholar
is
decent
indolent
complaisant
see
already
the
tragic
consequence
the
mind
of
this
country
taught
to
aim
at
low
objects
eats
upon
itself
there
is
no
work
for
any
one
but
the
decorous
and
the
complaisant
young
men
of
the
fairest
promise
who
begin
life
upon
our
shores
inflated
by
the
mountain
winds
shined
upon
by
all
the
stars
of
god
find
the
earth
below
not
in
unison
with
these
but
are
hindered
from
action
by
the
disgust
which
the
principles
on
which
business
is
managed
inspire
and
turn
drudges
or
die
of
disgust
some
of
them
suicides
what
is
the
remedy
they
did
not
yet
see
and
thousands
of
young
men
as
hopeful
now
crowding
to
the
barriers
for
the
career
do
not
yet
see
that
if
the
single
man
plant
himself
indomitably
on
his
instincts
and
there
abide
the
huge
world
will
come
round
to
him
patience
patience
with
the
shades
of
all
the
good
and

and
for
solace

and
for

the

the

of

the
making
those

prevalent

conversion

is
it
not
the
chief
disgrace
in
the
world
not
to
be
an
unit
not
to

reckoned
one
character
not
to
yield
that
peculiar
fruit
which
each

was
created

bear

to

the

and
like

thee
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
i
have
wished
to
write
a
discourse
on
compensation
for
it
seemed
to
me
when
very
young
that
on
this
subject
life
was
ahead
of
theology
and
the
people
knew
more
than
the
preachers
taught
the
documents
too
from
which
the
doctrine
is
to
be
drawn
charmed
my
fancy
by
their
endless
variety
and
lay
always
before
me
even
in
sleep
for
they
are
the
tools
in
our
hands
the
bread
in
our
basket
the
transactions
of
the
street
the
farm
and
the
greetings
relations
debts
and
credits
the
influence
of
character
the
nature
and
endowment
of
all
men
it
seemed
to
me
also
that
in
it
might
be
shown
men
a
ray
of
divinity
the
present
action
of
the
soul
of
this
world
clean
from
all
vestige
of
tradition
and
so
the
heart
of
man
might
be
bathed
by
an
inundation
of
eternal
love
conversing
with
that
which
he
knows
was
always
and
always
must
be
because
it
really
is
now
it
appeared
moreover
that
if
this
doctrine
could
be
stated
in
terms
with
any
resemblance
to
those
bright
intuitions
in
which
this
truth
is
sometimes
revealed
to
us
it
would
be
a
star
in
many
dark
hours
and
crooked
passages
in
our
journey
that
would
not
suffer
us
to
lose
our
way
i
was
lately
confirmed
in
these
desires
by
hearing
a
sermon
at
church
the
preacher
a
man
esteemed
for
his
orthodoxy
unfolded
in
the
ordinary
manner
the
doctrine
of
the
last
judgment
he
assumed
that
judgment
is
not
executed
in
this
world
that
the
wicked
are
successful
that
the
good
are
miserable
and
then
urged
from
reason
and
from
scripture
a
compensation
to
be
made
to
both
parties
in
the
next
life
no
offense
appeared
to
be
taken
by
the
congregation
at
this
doctrine
as
far
as
i
could
observe
when
the
meeting
broke
up
they
separated
without
remark
on
the
sermon
yet
what
was
the
import
of
this
teaching
what
did
the
preacher
mean
by
saying
that
the
good
are
miserable
in
the
present
life
was
it
that
houses
and
lands
offices
wine
horses
dress
luxury
are
had
by
unprincipled
men
whilst
the
saints
are
poor
and
despised
and
that
a
compensation
is
to
be
made
to
these
last
hereafter
by
giving
them
the
like
gratifications
another
day
bank
stock
and
doubloons
venison
and
champagne
this
must
be
the
compensation
intended
for
what
else
is
it
that
they
are
to
have
leave
to
pray
and
praise
to
love
and
serve
men
why
that
they
can
do
now
the
legitimate
inference
the
disciple
would
draw
was
we
are
to
have
a
good
time
as
the
sinners
have
now
or
to
push
it
to
its
extreme
import
you
sin
now
we
shall
sin
by
and
by
we
would
sin
now
if
we
could
not
being
successful
we
expect
our
revenue
the
fallacy
lay
in
the
immense
concession
that
the
bad
are
successful
that
justice
is
not
done
now
the
blindness
of
the
preacher
consisted
in
deferring
to
the
base
estimate
of
the
market
of
what
constitutes
a
manly
success
instead
of
confronting
and
convicting
the
world
from
the
truth
announcing
the
presence
of
the
soul
the
omnipotence
of
the
will
and
so
establishing
the
standard
of
good
and
ill
of
success
and
falsehood
i
find
a
similar
base
tone
in
the
popular
religious
works
of
the
day
and
the
same
doctrines
assumed
by
the
literary
men
when
occasionally
they
treat
the
related
topics
i
think
that
our
popular
theology
has
gained
in
decorum
and
not
in
principle
over
the
superstitions
it
has
displaced
but
men
are
better
than
this
theology
their
daily
life
gives
it
the
lie
every
ingenuous
and
aspiring
soul
leaves
the
doctrine
behind
him
in
his
own
experience
and
all
men
feel
sometimes
the
falsehood
which
they
can
not
demonstrate
few
men
are
wiser
than
they
know
that
which
they
hear
in
schools
and
pulpits
without
afterthought
if
said
in
conversation
would
probably
be
questioned
in
silence
if
a
man
dogmatize
in
a
mixed
company
on
providence
and
the
divine
laws
he
is
answered
by
a
silence
which
conveys
well
enough
to
an
observer
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
hearer
but
his
incapacity
to
make
his
own
statement
i
shall
attempt
in
this
and
the
following
chapter
to
record
some
facts
that
indicate
the
path
of
the
law
of
compensation
happy
beyond
my
expectation
if
i
shall
truly
draw
the
smallest
arc
of
this
circle
polarity
or
action
and
reaction
we
meet
in
every
part
of
nature
in
darkness
and
light
in
heat
and
cold
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
waters
in
male
and
female
in
the
inspiration
and
expiration
of
plants
and
animals
in
the
equation
of
quantity
and
quality
in
the
fluids
of
the
animal
body
in
the
systole
and
diastole
of
the
heart
in
the
undulations
of
fluids
and
of
sound
in
the
centrifugal
and
centripetal
gravity
in
electricity
galvanism
and
chemical
affinity
superinduce
magnetism
at
one
end
of
a
needle
the
opposite
magnetism
takes
place
at
the
other
end
if
the
south
attracts
the
north
repels
to
empty
here
you
must
condense
there
an
inevitable
dualism
bisects
nature
so
that
each
thing
is
a
half
and
suggests
another
thing
to
make
it
whole
as
spirit
matter
man
woman
odd
even
subjective
objective
in
out
upper
under
motion
rest
yea
nay
whilst
the
world
is
thus
dual
so
is
every
one
of
its
parts
the
entire
system
of
things
gets
represented
in
every
particle
there
is
somewhat
that
resembles
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
day
and
night
man
and
woman
in
a
single
needle
of
the
pine
in
a
kernel
of
corn
in
each
individual
of
every
animal
tribe
the
reaction
so
grand
in
the
elements
is
repeated
within
these
small
boundaries
for
example
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
physiologist
has
observed
that
no
creatures
are
favorites
but
a
certain
compensation
balances
every
gift
and
every
defect
a
surplusage
given
to
one
part
is
paid
out
of
a
reduction
from
another
part
of
the
same
creature
if
the
head
and
neck
are
enlarged
the
trunk
and
extremities
are
cut
short
the
theory
of
the
mechanic
forces
is
another
example
what
we
gain
in
power
is
lost
in
time
and
the
converse
the
periodic
or
compensating
errors
of
the
planets
is
another
instance
the
influences
of
climate
and
soil
in
political
history
is
another
the
cold
climate
invigorates
the
barren
soil
does
not
breed
fevers
crocodiles
tigers
or
scorpions
the
same
dualism
underlies
the
nature
and
condition
of
man
every
excess
causes
a
defect
every
defect
an
excess
every
sweet
hath
its
sour
every
evil
its
good
every
faculty
which
is
a
receiver
of
pleasure
has
an
equal
penalty
put
on
its
abuse
it
is
to
answer
for
its
moderation
with
its
life
for
every
grain
of
wit
there
is
a
grain
of
folly
for
everything
you
have
missed
you
have
gained
something
else
and
for
everything
you
gain
you
lose
something
if
riches
increase
they
are
increased
that
use
them
if
the
gatherer
gathers
too
much
nature
takes
out
of
the
man
what
she
puts
into
his
chest
swells
the
estate
but
kills
the
owner
nature
hates
monopolies
and
exceptions
the
waves
of
the
sea
do
not
more
speedily
seek
a
level
from
their
loftiest
tossing
than
the
varieties
of
condition
tend
to
equalize
themselves
there
is
always
some
leveling
circumstance
that
puts
down
the
overbearing
the
strong
the
rich
the
fortunate
substantially
on
the
same
ground
with
all
others
is
a
man
too
strong
and
fierce

and
by
temper
and
position
a
bad
citizen
a
morose
ruffian
with
a
dash
of
the
pirate
in

sends
him
a
troop
of
pretty
sons
and
daughters
who
are
getting
along
in
the
dame
classes
at
the
village
school
and
love

fear
for
them
smooths
his
grim
scowl

courtesy
thus
she
contrives
to
intenerate

takes
the
boar
out

puts

keeps
her

true
the
farmer
imagines
power

are
fine
things
but
the
president

by

under

of

history
honestly
confesses
that
man
must
have
been
as
free
as
culture
could
make
him
these
appearances
indicate
the
fact
that
the
universe
is
represented
in
every
one
of
its
particles
everything
in
nature
contains
all
the
powers
of
nature
everything
is
made
of
one
hidden
stuff
as
the
naturalist
sees
one
type
under

metamorphosis
and
regards
a
horse
as
a
running
man
a
fish
as
a

man
a

a

as

man
each

not

character
of

all
the
details
all
the

hindrances
energies
and
whole
system
of
every
other
every
occupation
trade

transaction
is
a
compend
of
the

and
a
correlative
of
every

each

is
an
entire
emblem
of
human
life
of
its
good

ill
its
trials
its
enemies
its
course
and
its

and
each

must
somehow
accommodate
the

all
his

the

all
find

to

small

so
do
we
put
our
life
into
every
act
the
true
doctrine
of
omnipresence
is
that
god
reappears
with
all
his
parts
in
every
moss
and
cobweb
the
value
of
the
universe
contrives
to
throw
itself
into
every
point
if
the
good
is
there
so
is
the
evil
if
the
affinity
so
the
repulsion
if
the

so
the
limitation
thus
is
the
universe
alive
all
things
are
moral
that
soul
which
within
us
is
a
sentiment
outside
of
us
is
a
law
we
feel
its
inspiration
out
there
in
history
we
can
see
its
fatal
strength
it
is
in
the
world
and
the
world
was
made
by
it
justice
is
not
postponed
a
perfect
equity
adjusts
its
balance
in
all
parts
of

greek

the
dice
of
god
are

the

looks
like
a

which

it
how
you
will
balances
itself
take
what
figure
you

its

every

every

is
punished
every

rewarded
every
wrong
redressed
in
silence
and
certainty
what
we
call
retribution
is
the
universal
necessity
by
which
the
whole
appears
wherever
a
part
appears
if
you
see
smoke
there
must
be
fire
if
you
see
a

or

you
know
that
the
trunk
to
which
it

is
there
behind
every
act
rewards
itself
or
in
other
words
integrates
itself
in
a
twofold
manner
first
in
the
thing
or
in
real
nature
and
secondly
in
the
circumstance
or
in
apparent
nature
men
call
the
circumstance
the
retribution
the
causal
retribution
is
in
the
thing
and
is
seen
by
the
soul
the
retribution
in
the
circumstance
is
seen
by
the
understanding
it
is
inseparable
from
the
thing
but
is
often
spread
over
a
long
time
and
so
does
not
become
distinct
until
after
many
years
the
specific
stripes
may
follow
late
after
the
offense
but
they
follow
because
they
accompany
it
crime
and
punishment
grow
out
of
one
stem
punishment
is
a
fruit
that
unsuspected
ripens
within
the
flower
of
the
pleasure
which
concealed
it
cause
and
effect
means
and
ends
seed
and
fruit
can
not
be
severed
for
the
effect
already
blooms
in
the
cause
the

preëxists
in
the
means
the
fruit
in
the
seed
whilst
thus
the
world
will
be
whole
and
refuses
to
be
disparted
we
seek
to
act
partially
to
sunder
to
appropriate
for
example
to
gratify
the
senses
we
sever
the
pleasure
of
the
senses
from
the
needs
of
the
character
the
ingenuity
of
man
has
always
been
dedicated
to
the
solution
of
one
problem
how
to
detach
the
sensual
sweet
the
sensual
strong
the
sensual
bright
from
the
moral
sweet
the
moral
deep
the
moral
fair
that
is
again
to
contrive
to
cut
clean
off
this
upper
surface
so
thin
as
to
leave
it
bottomless
to
get
a
without
an
the
soul
says
eat
the
body
would
feast
the
soul
says
the
man
and
woman
shall
be
one
flesh
and
one
soul
the
body
would
join
the
flesh
only
the
soul
says
have
dominion
over
all
things
to
the
ends
of
virtue
the
body
would
have
the
power
over
things
to
its
own
ends
the
soul
strives
amain
to
live
and
work
through
all
things
it
would
be
the
only
fact
all
things
shall
be
added
unto
it
power
pleasure
knowledge
beauty
the
particular
man
aims
to
be
somebody
to
set
up
for
himself
to
truck
and
higgle
for
a
private
good
and
in
particulars
to
ride
that
he
may
ride
to
dress
that
he
may
be
dressed
to
eat
that
he
may
eat
and
to
govern
that
he
may
be
seen
men
seek
to
be
great
they
would
have
offices
wealth
power
and
fame
they
think
that
to
be
great
is
to
possess
one
side
of
nature
the
sweet
without
the
other
side
the
bitter
this
dividing
and
detaching
is
steadily
counteracted
up
to
this
day
it
must
be
owned
no
projector
has
had
the
smallest
success
the
parted
water
reunites
behind
our
hand
pleasure
is
taken
out
of
pleasant
things
profit
out
of
profitable
things
power
out
of
strong
things
as
soon
as
we
seek
to
separate
them
from
the
whole
we
can
no
more
have
things
and
get
the
sensual
good
by
itself
than
we
can
get
an
inside
that
shall
have
no
outside
or
a
light
without
a
shadow
drive
out
nature
with
a
fork
she
comes
running
back
life
invests
itself
with
inevitable
conditions
which
the
unwise
seek
to
dodge
which
one
and
another
brags
that
he
does
not
know
that
they
do
not
touch
him
but
the
brag
is
on
his
lips
the
conditions
are
in
his
soul
if
he
escapes
them
in
one
part
they
attack
him
in
another
more
vital
part
if
he
has
escaped
them
in
form
and
in
the
appearance
it
is
because
he
has
resisted
his
life
and
fled
from
himself
and
the
retribution
is
so
much
death
so
signal
is
the
failure
of
all
attempts
to
make
this
separation
of
the
good
from
the
tax
that
the
experiment
would
not
be
tried
since
to
try
it
is
to
be
mad
but
for
the
circumstance
that
when
the
disease
began
in
the
will
of
rebellion
and
separation
the
intellect
is
at
once
infected
so
that
the
man
ceases
to
see
god
whole
in
each
object
but
is
able
to
see
the
sensual
allurement
of
an
object
and
not
see
the
sensual
hurt
he
sees
the
mermaid
head
but
not
the
dragon
tail
and
thinks
he
can
cut
off
that
which
he
would
have
from
that
which
he
would
not
have
how
secret
art
thou
who
dwellest
in
the
highest
heavens
in
silence
o
thou
only
great
god
sprinkling
with
an
unwearied
providence
certain
penal
blindnesses
upon
such
as
have
unbridled
desires
the
human
soul
is
true
to
these
facts
in
the
painting
of
fable
of
history
of
law
of
proverbs
of
conversation
it
finds
a
tongue
in
literature
unawares
thus
the
greeks
called
jupiter
supreme
mind
but
having
traditionally
ascribed
to
him
many
base
actions
they
involuntarily
made
amends
to
reason
by
tying
up
the
hands
of
so
bad
a
god
he
is
made
as
helpless
as
a
king
of
england
prometheus
knows
one
secret
which
jove
must
bargain
for
minerva
another
he
can
not
get
his
own
thunders
minerva
keeps
the
key
of
them
of
all
the
gods
i
only
know
the
keys
that
ope
the
solid
doors
within
whose
vaults
his
thunders
sleep
a
plain
confession
of
the
of
the
all
and
of
its
moral
aim
the
indian
mythology
ends
in
the
same
ethics
and
it
would
seem
impossible
for
any
fable
to
be
invented
to
get
any
currency
which
was
not
moral
aurora
forgot
to
ask
youth
for
her
lover
and
though
tithonus
is
immortal
he
is
old
achilles
is
not
quite
invulnerable
the
sacred
waters
did
not
wash
the
heel
by
which
thetis
held
him
siegfried
in
the
niebelungen
is
not
quite
immortal
for
a
leaf
fell
on
his
back
whilst
he
was
bathing
in
the
blood
and
that
spot
which
it
covered
is
mortal
and
so
it
must
be
there
is
a
crack
in
everything
god
has
made
it
would
seem
there
is
always
this
vindictive
circumstance
stealing
in
at
unawares
even
into
the
wild
poesy
in
which
the
human
fancy
attempted
to
make
bold
holiday
and
to
shake
itself
free
of
the
old
laws
this
this
kick
of
the
gun
certifying
that
the
law
is
fatal
that
in
nature
nothing
can
be
given
all
things
are
sold
this
is
that
ancient
doctrine
of
nemesis
who
keeps
watch
in
the
universe
and
lets
no
offense
go
unchastised
the
furies
they
said
are
attendants
on
justice
and
if
the
sun
in
heaven
should
transgress
his
path
they
would
punish
him
the
poets
related
that
stone
walls
and
iron
swords
and
leathern
thongs
had
an
occult
sympathy
with
the
wrongs
of
their
owners
that
the
belt
which
ajax
gave
hector
dragged
the
trojan
hero
over
the
field
at
the
wheels
of
the
car
of
achilles
and
the
sword
which
hector
gave
ajax
was
that
on
whose
point
ajax
fell
they
recorded
that
when
the
thasians
erected
a
statue
to
theagenes
a
victor
in
the
games
one
of
his
rivals
went
to
it
by
night
and
endeavored
to
throw
it
down
by
repeated
blows
until
at
last
he
moved
it
from
its
pedestal
and
was
crushed
to
death
beneath
its
fall
this
voice
of
fable
has
in
it
somewhat
divine
it
came
from
thought
above
the
will
of
the
writer
that
is
the
best
part
of
each
writer
which
has
nothing
private
in
it
that
which
he
does
not
know
that
which
flowed
out
of
his
constitution
and
not
from
his
too
active
invention
that
which
in
the
study
of
a
single
artist
you
might
not
easily
find
but
in
the
study
of
many
you
would
abstract
as
the
spirit
of
them
all
phidias
it
is
not
but
the
work
of
man
in
that
early
hellenic
world
that
i
would
know
the
name
and
circumstance
of
phidias
however
convenient
for
history
embarrass
when
we
come
to
the
highest
criticism
we
are
to
see
that
which
man
was
tending
to
do
in
a
given
period
and
was
hindered
or
if
you
will
modified
in
doing
by
the
interfering
volitions
of
phidias
of
dante
of
shakespeare
the
organ
whereby
man
at
the
moment
wrought
still
more
striking
is
the
expression
of
this
fact
in
the
proverbs
of
all
nations
which
are
always
the
literature
of
reason
or
the
statements
of
an
absolute
truth
without
qualification
proverbs
like
the
sacred
books
of
each
nation
are
the
sanctuary
of
the
intuitions
that
which
the
droning
world
chained
to
appearances
will
not
allow
the
realist
to
say
in
his
own
words
it
will
suffer
him
to
say
in
proverbs
without
contradiction
and
this
law
of
laws
which
the
pulpit
the
senate
and
the
college
deny
is
hourly
preached
in
all
markets
and
workshops
by
flights
of
proverbs
whose
teaching
is
as
true
and
as
omnipresent
as
that
of
birds
and
flies
all

the

around
your
bad

the
the

an

it
is
thus
written
because
it
is
thus
in
life
our
action
is
overmastered
and
characterized
above
our
will
by
the
law
of
nature
we
aim
at
a
petty
end
quite
aside
from
the
public
good
but
our
act
arranges
itself
by
irresistible
magnetism
in
a
line
with
the
poles
of
the
world
a
man
can
not
speak
but
he
judges
himself
with
his
will
or
against
his
will
he
draws
his
portrait
to
the
eye
of
his
companions
by
every
word
every

reacts
on

who
utters
it
it
is
a
thrown
at
a
mark
but
the
other
end
remains
in

rather
it
is
a
harpoon
hurled
at
the

unwinding
as

flies
a
coil

and
if
the
harpoon
is
not
good
or
not
well
thrown
it
will
go
nigh
to
cut
the
steersman
in
twain
or
to
sink
the

you
can
not
do
wrong
without
suffering

no

but
as
soon
as
there
is
any
departure
from
simplicity
and
attempt
at
halfness
or
good
for
me
that
is
not
good
for
him
my
neighbor
feels
the
wrong
he
shrinks
from
me
as
far
as
i
have
shrunk
from
him
his
eyes
no
longer
seek
mine
there
is
war
between
us
there
is
hate
in
him
and
fear
in
me
all
the
old
abuses
in
society
universal
and
particular
all
unjust
accumulations
of
property
and
power
are
avenged
in
the
same
manner
fear
is
an
instructor
of
great
sagacity
and
the
herald
of
all
revolutions
one
thing
he
teaches
that
there
is
rottenness
where
he
appears
he
is
a
carrion
crow
and
though
you
see
not
well
what
he
hovers
for
there
is
death
somewhere
our
property
is
timid
our
laws
are
timid
our
cultivated
classes
are
timid
fear
for
ages
has
boded
and
mowed
and
gibbered
over
government
and
property
that
obscene
bird
is
not
there
for
nothing
he
indicates
great
wrongs
which
must
be
revised
of
the
like
nature
is
that
expectation
of
change
which
instantly
follows
the
suspension
of
our
voluntary
activity
the
terror
of
cloudless
noon
the
emerald
of
polycrates
the
awe
of
prosperity
the
instinct
which
leads
every
generous
soul
to
impose
on
itself
tasks
of
a
noble
asceticism
and
vicarious
virtue
are
the
tremblings
of
the
balance
of
justice
through
the
heart
and
mind
of
man
experienced
men
of
the
world
know
very
well
that
it
is
best
to
pay
scot
and
lot
as
they
go
along
and
that
a
man
often
pays
dear
for
a
small
frugality
the
borrower
runs
in
his
own
debt
has
a
man
gained
anything
who
has
received
a
hundred
favors
and
rendered
none
has
he
gained
by
borrowing
through
indolence
or
cunning
his
wares
or
horses
or
money
there
arises
on
the
deed
the
instant
acknowledgment
of
benefit
on
the
one
part
and
of
debt
on
the
other
that
is
of
superiority
and
inferiority
the
transaction
remains
in
the
memory
of
himself
and
his
neighbor
and
every
new
transaction
alters
according
to
its
nature
their
relation
to
each
other
he
may
soon
come
to
see
that
he
had
better
have
broken
his
own
bones
than
to
have
ridden
in
his
neighbor
coach
and
that
the
highest
price
he
can
pay
for
a
thing
is
to
ask
for
it
a
wise
man
will
extend
this
lesson
to
all
parts
of
life
and
know
that
it
is
the
part
of
prudence
to
face
every
claimant
and
pay
every
just
demand
on
your
time
your
talents
or
your
heart
always
pay
for
first
or
last
you
must
pay
your
entire
debt
persons
and
events
may
stand
for
a
time
between
you
and
justice
but
it
is
only
a
postponement
you
must
pay
at
last
your
own
debt
if
you
are
wise
you
will
dread
a
prosperity
which
only
loads
you
with
more
benefit
is
the
end
of
nature
but
for
every
benefit
which
you
receive
a
tax
is
levied
he
is
great
who
confers
the
most
benefits
he
is
base
and
that
is
the
one
base
thing
in
the
universe
to
receive
favors
and
render
none
in
the
order
of
nature
we
can
not
render
benefits
to
those
from
whom
we
receive
them
or
only
seldom
but
the
benefit
we
receive
must
be
rendered
again
line
for
line
deed
for
deed
cent
for
cent
to
somebody
beware
of
too
much
good
staying
in
your
hand
it
will
fast
corrupt
and
worm
worms
pay
it
away
quickly
in
some
sort
labor
is
watched
over
by
the
same
pitiless
laws
cheapest
say
the
prudent
is
the
dearest
labor
what
we
buy
in
a
broom
a
mat
a
wagon
a
knife
is
some
application
of
good
sense
to
a
common
want
it
is
best
to
pay
in
your
land
a
skillful
gardener
or
to
buy
good
sense
applied
to
gardening
in
your
sailor
good
sense
applied
to
navigation
in
the
house
good
sense
applied
to
cooking
sewing
serving
in
your
agent
good
sense
applied
to
accounts
and
affairs
so
do
you
multiply
your
presence
or
spread
yourself
throughout
your
estate
but
because
of
the
dual
constitution
of
things
in
labor
as
in
life
there
can
be
no
cheating
the
thief
steals
from
himself
the
swindler
swindles
himself
for
the
real
price
of
labor
is
knowledge
and
virtue
whereof
wealth
and
credit
are
signs
these
signs
like
paper
money
may
be
counterfeited
or
stolen
but
that
which
they
represent
namely
knowledge
and
virtue
can
not
be
counterfeited
or
stolen
these
ends
of
labor
can
not
be
answered
but
by
real
exertions
of
the
mind
and
in
obedience
to
pure
motives
the
cheat
the
defaulter
the
gambler
can
not
extort
the
knowledge
of
material
and
moral
nature
which
his
honest
care
and
pains
yield
to
the
operative
the
law
of
nature
is
do
the
thing
and
you
shall
have
the
power
but
they
who
do
not
the
thing
have
not
the
power
human
labor
through
all
its
forms
from
the
sharpening
of
a
stake
to
the
construction
of
a
city
or
an
epic
is
one
immense
illustration
of
the
perfect
compensation
of
the
universe
the
absolute
balance
of
give
and
take
the
doctrine
that
everything
has
its
price
and
if
that
price
is
not
paid
not
that
thing
but
something
else
is
obtained
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
anything
without
its
price
is
not
less
sublime
in
the
columns
of
a
ledger
than
in
the
budgets
of
states
in
the
laws
of
light
and
darkness
in
all
the
action
and
reaction
of
nature
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
high
laws
which
each
man
sees
implicated
in
those
processes
with
which
he
is
conversant
the
stern
ethics
which
sparkle
on
his
chisel
edge
which
are
measured
out
by
his
plumb
and
foot
rule
which
stand
as
manifest
in
the
footing
of
the
shop
bill
as
in
the
history
of
a
state
do
recommend
to
him
his
trade
and
though
seldom
named
exalt
his
business
to
his
imagination
the
league
between
virtue
and
nature
engages
all
things
to
assume
a
hostile
front
to
vice
the
beautiful
laws
and
substances
of
the
world
persecute
and
whip
the
traitor
he
finds
that
things
are
arranged
for
truth
and
benefit
but
there
is
no
den
in
the
wide
world
to
hide
a
rogue
commit
a
crime
and
the
earth
is
made
of
glass
commit
a
crime
and
it
seems
as
if
a
coat
of
snow
fell
on
the
ground
such
as
reveals
in
the
woods
the
track
of
every
partridge
and
fox
and
squirrel
and
mole
you
can
not
recall
the
spoken
word
you
can
not
wipe
out
the
you
can
not
draw
up
the
ladder
so
as
to
leave
no
inlet
or
clew
some
damning
circumstance
always
transpires
the
laws
and
substances
of
nature
water
snow
wind
gravitation
become
penalties
to
the
thief
on
the
other
hand
the
law
holds
with
equal
sureness
for
all
right
action
love
and
you
shall
be
loved
all
love
is
mathematically
just
as
much
as
the
two
sides
of
an
algebraic
equation
the
good
man
has
absolute
good
which
like
fire
turns
everything
to
its
own
nature
so
that
you
can
not
do
him
any
harm
but
as
the
royal
armies
sent
against
napoleon
when
he
approached
cast
down
their
colors
and
from
enemies
became
friends
so
disasters
of
all
kinds
as
sickness
offense
poverty
prove
benefactors
winds
blow
and
waters
roll
strength
to
the
brave
and
power
and
deity
yet
in
themselves
are
nothing
the
good
are
befriended
even
by
weakness
and
defect
as
no
man
had
ever
a
point
of
pride
that
was
not
injurious
to
him
so
no
man
had
ever
a
defect
that
was
not
somewhere
made
useful
to
him
the
stag
in
the
fable
admired
his
horns
and
blamed
his
feet
but
when
the
hunter
came
his
feet
saved
him
and
afterwards
caught
in
the
thicket
his
horns
destroyed
him
every
man
in
his
lifetime
needs
to
thank
his
faults
as
no
man
thoroughly
understands
a
truth
until
he
has
contended
against
it
so
no
man
has
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
hindrances
or
talents
of
men
until
he
has
suffered
from
the
one
and
seen
the
triumph
of
the
other
over
his
own
want
of
the
same
has
he
a
defect
of
temper
that
unfits
him
to
live
in
society
thereby
he
is
driven
to
entertain
himself
alone
and
acquire
habits
of
and
thus
like
the
wounded
oyster
he
mends
his
shell
with
pearl
our
strength
grows
out
of
our
weakness
the
indignation
which
arms
itself
with
secret
forces
does
not
awaken
until
we
are
pricked
and
stung
and
sorely
assailed
a
great
man
is
always
willing
to
be
little
whilst
he
sits
on
the
cushion
of
advantages
he
goes
to
sleep
when
he
is
punished
tormented
defeated
he
has
a
chance
to
learn
something
he
has
been
put
on
his
wits
on
his
manhood
he
has
gained
facts
learns
his
ignorance
is
cured
of
the
insanity
of
conceit
has
got
moderation
and
real
skill
the
wise
man
throws
himself
on
the
side
of
his
assailants
it
is
more
his
interest
than
it
is
theirs
to
find
his
weak
point
the
wound
cicatrizes
and
falls
off
from
him
like
a
dead
skin
and
when
they
would
triumph
lo
he
has
passed
on
invulnerable
blame
is
safer
than
praise
i
hate
to
be
defended
in
a
newspaper
as
long
as
all
that
is
said
is
said
against
me
i
feel
a
certain
assurance
of
success
but
as
soon
as
honeyed
words
of
praise
are
spoken
for
me
i
feel
as
one
that
lies
unprotected
before
his
enemies
in
general
every
evil
to
which
we
do
not
succumb
is
a
benefactor
as
the
sandwich
islander
believes
that
the
strength
and
valor
of
the
enemy
he
kills
passes
into
himself
so
we
gain
the
strength
of
the
temptation
we
resist
the
same
guards
which
protect
us
from
disaster
defect
and
enmity
defend
us
if
we
will
from
selfishness
and
fraud
bolts
and
bars
are
not
the
best
of
our
institutions
nor
is
shrewdness
in
trade
a
mark
of
wisdom
men
suffer
all
their
life
long
under
the
foolish
superstition
that
they
can
be
cheated
but
it
is
as
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
cheated
by
anyone
but
himself
as
for
a
thing
to
be
and
not
to
be
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
third
silent
party
to
all
our
bargains
the
nature
and
soul
of
things
takes
on
itself
the
guaranty
of
the
fulfillment
of
every
contract
so
that
honest
service
can
not
come
to
loss
if
you
serve
an
ungrateful
master
serve
him
the
more
put
god
in
your
debt
every
stroke
shall
be
repaid
the
longer
the
payment
is
withholden
the
better
for
you
for
compound
interest
on
compound
interest
is
the
rate
and
usage
of
this
exchequer
the
history
of
persecution
is
a
history
of
endeavors
to
cheat
nature
to
make
water
run
up
hill
to
twist
a
rope
of
sand
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
actors
be
many
or
one
a
tyrant
or
a
mob
a
mob
is
a
society
of
bodies
voluntarily
bereaving
themselves
of
reason
and
traversing
its
work
the
mob
is
man
voluntarily
descending
to
the
nature
of
the
beast
its
fit
hour
of
activity
is
night
its
actions
are
insane
like
its
whole
constitution
it
persecutes
a
principle
it
would
whip
a
right
it
would
tar
and
feather
justice
by
inflicting
fire
and
outrage
upon
the
houses
and
persons
of
those
who
have
these
it
resembles
the
prank
of
boys
who
run
with
fire
engines
to
put
out
the
ruddy
aurora
streaming
to
the
stars
the
inviolate
spirit
turns
their
spite
against
the
wrongdoers
the
martyr
can
not
be
dishonored
every
lash
inflicted
is
a
tongue
of
fame
every
prison
a
more
illustrious
abode
every
burned
book
or
house
enlightens
the
world
every
suppressed
or
expunged
word
reverberates
through
the
earth
from
side
to
side
hours
of
sanity
and
consideration
are
always
arriving
to
communities
as
to
individuals
when
the
truth
is
seen
and
the
martyrs
are
justified
thus
do
all
things
preach
the
indifferency
of
circumstances
the
man
is
all
everything
has
two
sides
a
good
and
an
evil
every
advantage
has
its
tax
i
learn
to
be
content
but
the
doctrine
of
compensation
is
not
the
doctrine
of
indifferency
the
thoughtless
say
on
hearing
these
representations
what
boots
it
to
do
well
there
is
one
event
to
good
and
evil
if
i
gain
any
good
i
must
pay
for
it
if
i
lose
any
good
i
gain
some
other
all
actions
are
indifferent
there
is
a
deeper
fact
in
the
soul
than
compensation
to
wit
its
own
nature
the
soul
is
not
a
compensation
but
a
life
the
soul
under
all
this
running
sea
of
circumstance
whose
waters
ebb
and
flow
with
perfect
balance
lies
the
aboriginal
abyss
of
real
being
essence
or
god
is
not
a
relation
or
a
part
but
the
whole
being
is
the
vast
affirmative
excluding
negation
and
swallowing
up
all
relations
parts
and
times
within
itself
nature
truth
virtue
are
the
influx
from
thence
vice
is
the
absence
or
departure
of
the
same
nothing
falsehood
may
indeed
stand
as
the
great
night
or
shade
on
which
as
a
background
the
living
universe
paints
itself
forth
but
no
fact
is
begotten
by
it
it
can
not
work
for
it
is
not
it
can
not
work
any
good
it
can
not
work
any
harm
it
is
harm
inasmuch
as
it
is
worse
not
to
be
than
to
be
we
feel
defrauded
of
the
retribution
due
to
evil
acts
because
the
criminal
adheres
to
his
vice
and
contumacy
and
does
not
come
to
a
crisis
or
judgment
anywhere
in
visible
nature
there
is
no
stunning
confutation
of
his
nonsense
before
men
and
angels
has
he
therefore
outwitted
the
law
inasmuch
as
he
carries
the
malignity
and
the
lie
with
him
he
so
far
deceases
from
nature
in
some
manner
there
will
be
a
demonstration
of
the
wrong
to
the
understanding
also
but
should
we
not
see
it
this
deadly
deduction
makes
square
the
eternal
account
neither
can
it
be
said
on
the
other
hand
that
the
gain
of
rectitude
must
be
bought
by
any
loss
there
is
no
penalty
to
virtue
no
penalty
to
wisdom
they
are
proper
additions
of
being
in
a
virtuous
action
i
properly
in
a
virtuous
act
i
add
to
the
world
i
plant
into
deserts
conquered
from
chaos
and
nothing
and
see
the
darkness
receding
on
the
limits
of
the
horizon
there
can
be
no
excess
to
love
none
to
knowledge
none
to
beauty
when
these
attributes
are
considered
in
the
purest
sense
the
soul
refuses
limits
and
always
affirms
an
optimism
never
a
pessimism
man
life
is
a
progress
and
not
a
station
his
instinct
is
trust
our
instinct
uses
more
and
less
in
application
to
man
of
the
of
the
and
not
of
its
absence
the
brave
man
is
greater
than
the
coward
the
true
the
benevolent
the
wise
is
more
a
man
and
not
less
than
the
fool
and
knave
there
is
no
tax
on
the
good
of
virtue
for
that
is
the
incoming
of
god
himself
or
absolute
existence
without
any
comparative
material
good
has
its
tax
and
if
it
came
without
desert
or
sweat
has
no
root
in
me
and
the
next
wind
will
blow
it
away
but
all
the
good
of
nature
is
the
soul
and
may
be
had
if
paid
for
in
nature
lawful
coin
that
is
by
labor
which
the
heart
and
the
head
allow
i
no
longer
wish
to
meet
a
good
i
do
not
earn
for
example
to
find
a
pot
of
buried
gold
knowing
that
it
brings
with
it
new
burdens
i
do
not
wish
more
external
goods
neither
possessions
nor
honors
nor
powers
nor
persons
the
gain
is
apparent
the
tax
is
certain
but
there
is
no
tax
on
the
knowledge
that
the
compensation
exists
and
that
it
is
not
desirable
to
dig
up
treasure
herein
i
rejoice
with
a

eternal
peace

nothing

work
me
damage
except
myself
the
harm
that
i
sustain
i
carry
about
with
me
and
never
am
a
real
sufferer
but
by
my
own
fault
in
the
nature
of
the
soul
is
the
compensation
for
the
inequalities
of
condition
the
radical
tragedy
of
nature
seems
to
be
the
distinction
of
more
and
less
how
can
less
not
feel
the
pain
how
not
feel
indignation
or
malevolence
towards
more
look
at
those
who
have
less
faculty
and
one
feels
sad
and
knows
not
well
what
to
make
of
it
he
almost
shuns
their
eye
he
fears
they
will
upbraid
god
what
should
they
do
it
seems
a
great
injustice
but
see
the
facts
nearly
and
these
mountainous
inequalities
vanish
love
reduces
them
as
the
sun
melts
the
iceberg
in
the
sea
the
heart
and
soul
of
all
men
being
one
this
bitterness
of
and
ceases
his
is
mine
i
am
my
brother
and
my
brother
is
me
if
i
feel
overshadowed
and
outdone
by
great
neighbors
i
can
yet
love
i
can
still
receive
and
he
that
loveth
maketh
his
own
the
grandeur
he
loves
thereby
i
make
the
discovery
that
my
brother
is
my
guardian
acting
for
me
with
the
friendliest
designs
and
the
estate
i
so
admired
and
envied
is
my
own
it
is
the
nature
of
the
soul
to
appropriate
all
things
jesus
and
shakespeare
are
fragments
of
the
soul
and
by
love
i
conquer
and
incorporate
them
in
my
own
conscious
domain
his
virtue
is
not
that
mine
his
wit
if
it
can
not
be
made
mine
it
is
not
wit
such
also
is
the
natural
history
of
calamity
the
changes
which
break
up
at
short
intervals
the
prosperity
of
men
are
advertisements
of
a
nature
whose
law
is
growth
every
soul
is
by
this
intrinsic
necessity
quitting
its
whole
system
of
things
its
friends
and
home
and
laws
and
faith
as
the
shellfish
crawls
out
of
its
beautiful
but
stony
case
because
it
no
longer
admits
of
its
growth
and
slowly
forms
a
new
house
in
proportion
to
the
vigor
of
the
individual
these
revolutions
are
frequent
until
in
some
happier
mind
they
are
incessant
and
all
worldly
relations
hang
very
loosely
about
him
becoming
as
it
were
a
transparent
fluid
membrane
through
which
the
living
form
is
seen
and
not
as
in
most
men
an
indurated
heterogeneous
fabric
of
many
dates
and
of
no
settled
character
in
which
the
man
is
imprisoned
then
there
can
be
enlargement
and
the
man
of
scarcely
recognizes
the
man
of
yesterday
and
such
should
be
the
outward
biography
of
man
in
time
a
putting
off
of
dead
circumstances
day
by
day
as
he
renews
his
raiment
day
by
day
but
to
us
in
our
lapsed
estate
resting
not
advancing
resisting
not
coöperating
with
the
divine
expansion
this
growth
comes
by
shocks
we
can
not
part
with
our
friend
we
can
not
let
our
angels
go
we
do
not
see
that
they
only
go
out
that
archangels
may
come
in
we
are
idolaters
of
the
old
we
do
not
believe
in
the
riches
of
the
soul
in
its
proper
eternity
and
omnipresence
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
force
in
to
rival
or
recreate
that
beautiful
yesterday
we
linger
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
tent
where
once
we
had
bread
and
shelter
and
organs
nor
believe
that
the
spirit
can
feed
cover
and
nerve
us
again
we
can
not
again
find
aught
so
dear
so
sweet
so
graceful
but
we
sit
and
weep
in
vain
the
voice
of
the
almighty
saith
up
and
onward
forevermore
we
can
not
stay
amid
the
ruins
neither
will
we
rely
on
the
new
and
so
we
walk
ever
with
reverted
eyes
like
those
monsters
who
look
backwards
and
yet
the
compensations
of
calamity
are
made
apparent
to
the
understanding
also
after
long
intervals
of
time
a
fever
a
mutilation
a
cruel
disappointment
a
loss
of
wealth
a
loss
of
friends
seems
at
the
moment
unpaid
loss
and
unpayable
but
the
sure
years
reveal
the
deep
remedial
force
that
underlies
all
facts
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
wife
brother
lover
which
seemed
nothing
but
privation
somewhat
later
assumes
the
aspect
of
a
guide
or
genius
for

commonly
operates
revolutions
in
our
way
of
life
terminates
an
epoch
of
infancy
or
of
youth
which
was
waiting
to
be
closed
breaks
up
a
wonted
occupation
or
a
household
or
style
of
living
and
allows
the
formation
of
new
ones
more
friendly
to
the
growth
of
character
it
permits
or
constrains
the
formation
of
new
acquaintances
and
the
reception
of
new
influences
that
prove
of
the
first
importance
to
the
next
years
and
the
man
or
woman
who
would
have
remained
a
sunny
garden
flower
with
no
room
for
its
roots
and
too
much
sunshine
for
its
head
by
the
falling
of
the
walls
and
the
neglect
of
the
gardener
is
made
the
banyan
of
the
forest
yielding
shade
and
fruit
to
wide
neighborhoods
of

is
his
own
star
and
the
soul
that
can
render
an
honest
and
a
perfect
man
commands
all
light
all
influence
all
fate
nothing
to
him
falls
early
or
too
late
our
acts
our
angels
are
or
good
or
ill
our
fatal
shadows
that
walk
by
us
still
cast

bantling

the
rocks

with
the
teat
wintered
with
the

and

and

and

i
read
the
other
day
some
verses
written
by
an
eminent
painter
which
were
original
and
not
conventional
the
soul
always
hears
an
admonition
in
such
lines
let
the
subject
be
what
it
may
the
sentiment
they
instill
is
of
more
value
than
any
thought
they
may
contain
to
believe
your
own
thought
to
believe
that
what
is
true
for
you
in
your
private
heart
is
true
for
all
men
that
is
genius
speak
your
latent
conviction
and
it
shall
be
the
universal
sense
for
the
inmost
in
due
time
becomes
the
outmost
and
our
first
thought
is
rendered
back
to
us
by
the
trumpets
of
the
last
judgment
familiar
as
the
voice
of
the
mind
is
to
each
the
highest
merit
we
ascribe
to
moses
plato
and
milton
is
that
they
set
at
naught
books
and
traditions
and
spoke
not
what
men
but
what
they
thought
a
man
should
learn
to
detect
and
watch
that
gleam
of
light
which
flashes
across
his
mind
from
within
more
than
the
luster
of
the
firmament
of
bards
and
sages
yet
he
dismisses
without
notice
his
thought
because
it
is
his
in
every
work
of
genius
we
recognize
our
own
rejected
thoughts
they
come
back
to
us
with
a
certain
alienated
majesty
great
works
of
art
have
no
more
affecting
lesson
for
us
than
this
they
teach
us
to
abide
by
our
spontaneous
impression
with
inflexibility
then
most
when
the
whole
cry
of
voices
is
on
the
other
side
else
a
stranger
will
say
with
masterly
good
sense
precisely
what
we
have
thought
and
felt
all
the
time
and
we
shall
be
forced
to
take
with
shame
our
own
opinion
from
another
there
is
a
time
in
every
man
education
when
he
arrives
at
the
conviction
that
envy
is
ignorance
that
imitation
is
suicide
that
he
must
take
himself
for
better
for
worse
as
his
portion
that
though
the
wide
universe
is
full
of
good
no
kernel
of
nourishing
corn
can
come
to
him
but
through
his
toil
bestowed
on
that
plot
of
ground
which
is
given
to
him
to
till
the
power
which
resides
in
him
is
new
in
nature
and
none
but
he
knows
what
that
is
which
he
can
do
nor
does
he
know
until
he
has
tried
not
for
nothing
one
face
one
character
one
fact
makes
much
impression
on
him
and
another
none
this
sculpture
in
the
memory
is
not
without
preëstablished
harmony
the
eye
was
placed
where
one
ray
should
fall
that
it
might
testify
of
that
particular
ray
we
but
half
express
ourselves
and
are
ashamed
of
that
divine
idea
which
each
of
us
represents
it
may
be
safely
trusted
as
proportionate
and
of
good
issues
so
it
be
faithfully
imparted
but
god
will
not
have
his
work
made
manifest
by
cowards
a
man
is
relieved
and
gay
when
he
has
put
his
heart
into
his
work
and
done
his
best
but
what
he
has
said
or
done
otherwise
shall
give
him
no
peace
it
is
a
deliverance
which
does
not
deliver
in
the
attempt
his
genius
deserts
him
no
muse
befriends
no
invention
no
hope
trust
thyself
every
heart
vibrates
to
that
iron
string
accept
the
place
the
divine
providence
has
found
for
you
the
society
of
your
contemporaries
the
connection
of
events
great
men
have
always
done
so
and
confided
themselves
childlike
to
the
genius
of
their
age
betraying
their
perception
that
the
absolutely
trustworthy
was
seated
at
their
heart
working
through
their
hands
predominating
in
all
their
being
and
we
are
now
men
and
must
accept
in
the
highest
mind
the
same
transcendent
destiny
and
not
minors
and
invalids
in
a
protected
corner
not
cowards
fleeing
before
a
revolution
but
guides
redeemers
and
benefactors
obeying
the
almighty
effort
and
advancing
on
chaos
and
the
dark
what
pretty
oracles
nature
yields
us
on
this
text
in
the
face
and
behavior
of
children
babes
and
even
brutes
that
divided
and
rebel
mind
that
distrust
of
a
sentiment
because
our
arithmetic
has
computed
the
strength
and
means
opposed
to
our
purpose
these
have
not
their
mind
being
whole
their
eye
is
as
yet
unconquered
and
when
we
look
in
their
faces
we
are
disconcerted
infancy
conforms
to
nobody
all
conform
to
it
so
that
one
babe
commonly
makes
four
or
five
out
of
the
adults
who
prattle
and
play
to
it
so
god
has
armed
youth
and
puberty
and
manhood
no
less
with
its
own
piquancy
and
charm
and
made
it
enviable
and
gracious
and
its
claims
not
to
be
put
by
if
it
will
stand
by
itself
do
not
think
the
youth
has
no
force
because
he
can
not
speak
to
you
and
me
hark
in
the
next
room
his
voice
is
sufficiently
clear
and
emphatic
it
seems
he
knows
how
to
speak
to
his
contemporaries
bashful
or
bold
then
he
will
know
how
to
make
us
seniors
very
unnecessary
the
nonchalance
of
boys
who
are
sure
of
a
dinner
and
would
disdain
as
much
as
a
lord
to
do
or
say
aught
to
conciliate
one
is
the
healthy
attitude
of
human
nature
a
boy
is
in
the
parlor
what
the
pit
is
in
the
playhouse
independent
irresponsible
looking
out
from
his
corner
on
such
people
and
facts
as
pass
by
he
tries
and
sentences
them
on
their
merits
in
the
swift
summary
way
of
boys
as
good
bad
interesting
silly
eloquent
troublesome
he
cumbers
himself
never
about
consequences
about
interests
he
gives
an
independent
genuine
verdict
you
must
court
him
he
does
not
court
you
but
the
man
is
as
it
were
clapped
into
jail
by
his
consciousness
as
soon
as
he
has
once
acted
or
spoken
with
he
is
a
committed
person
watched
by
the
sympathy
or
the
hatred
of
hundreds
whose
affections
must
now
enter
into
his
account
there
is
no
lethe
for
this
ah
that
he
could
pass
again
into
his
neutrality
who
can
thus
avoid
all
pledges
and
having
observed
observe
again
from
the
same
unaffected
unbiased
unbribable
unaffrighted
innocence
must
always
be
formidable
he
would
utter
opinions
on
all
passing
affairs
which
being
seen
to
be
not
private
but
necessary
would
sink
like
darts
into
the
ear
of
men
and
put
them
in
fear
these
are
the
voices
which
we
hear
in
solitude
but
they
grow
faint
and
inaudible
as
we
enter
into
the
world
society
everywhere
is
in
conspiracy
against
the
manhood
of
every
one
of
its
members
society
is
a
company
in
which
the
members
agree
for
the
better
securing
of
his
bread
to
each
shareholder
to
surrender
the
liberty
and
culture
of
the
eater
the
virtue
in
most
request
is
conformity
is
its
aversion
it
loves
not
realities
and
creators
but
names
and
customs
whoso
would
be
a
man
must
be
a
nonconformist
he
who
would
gather
immortal
palms
must
not
be
hindered
by
the
name
of
goodness
but
must
explore
if
it
be
goodness
nothing
is
at
last
sacred
but
the
integrity
of
your
own
mind
absolve
you
to
yourself
and
you
shall
have
the
suffrage
of
the
world
i
remember
an
answer
which
when
quite
young
i
was
prompted
to
make
to
a
valued
adviser
who
was
wont
to
importune
me
with
the
dear
old
doctrines
of
the
church
on
my
saying
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
sacredness
of
traditions
if
i
live
wholly
from
within
my
friend
suggested
but
these
impulses
may
be
from
below
not
from
above
i
replied
they
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
such
but
if
i
am
the
devil
child
i
will
live
then
from
the
devil
no
law
can
be
sacred
to
me
but
that
of
my
nature
good
and
bad
are
but
names
very
readily
transferable
to
that
or
this
the
only
right
is
what
is
after
my
constitution
the
only
wrong
what
is
against
it
a
man
is
to
carry
himself
in
the
presence
of
all
opposition
as
if
everything
were
titular
and
ephemeral
but
he
i
am
ashamed
to
think
how
easily
we
capitulate
to
badges
and
names
to
large
societies
and
dead
institutions
every
decent
and
individual
affects
and
sways
me
more
than
is
right
i
ought
to
go
upright
and
vital
and
speak
the
rude
truth
in
all
ways
if
malice
and
vanity
wear
the
coat
of
philanthropy
shall
that
pass
if
an
angry
bigot
assumes
this
bountiful
cause
of
abolition
and
comes
to
me
with
his
last
news
from
barbadoes
why
should
i
not
say
to
him
go
love
thy
infant
love
thy
be
and
modest
have
that
grace
and
never
varnish
your
hard
uncharitable
ambition
with
this
incredible
tenderness
for
black
folk
a
thousand
miles
off
thy
love
afar
is
spite
at
home
rough
and
graceless
would
be
such
greeting
but
truth
is
handsomer
than
the
affectation
of
love
your
goodness
must
have
some
edge
to
it
else
it
is
none
the
doctrine
of
hatred
must
be
preached
as
the
counteraction
of
the
doctrine
of
love
when
that
pules
and
whines
i
shun
father
and
mother
and
wife
and
brother
when
my
genius
calls
me
i
would
write
on
the
lintels
of
the
i
hope
it
is
somewhat
better
than
whim
at
last
but
we
can
not
spend
the
day
in
explanation
expect
me
not
to
show
cause
why
i
seek
or
why
i
exclude
company
then
again
do
not
tell
me
as
a
good
man
did
of
my
obligation
to
put
all
poor
men
in
good
situations
are
they
poor
i
tell
thee
thou
foolish
philanthropist
that
i
grudge
the
dollar
the
dime
the
cent
i
give
to
such
men
as
do
not
belong
to
me
and
to
whom
i
do
not
belong
there
is
a
class
of
persons
to
whom
by
all
spiritual
affinity
i
am
bought
and
sold
for
them
i
will
go
to
prison
if
need
be
but
your
miscellaneous
popular
charities
the
education
at
college
of
fools
the
building
of
to
the
vain
end
to
which
many
now
stand
alms
to
sots
and
the
relief
societies
though
i
confess
with
shame
i
sometimes
succumb
and
give
the
dollar
it
is
a
wicked
dollar
which
by
and
by
i
shall
have
the
manhood
to
withhold
virtues
are
in
the
popular
estimate
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
there
is
the
man
his
virtues
men
do
what
is
called
a
good
action
as
some
piece
of
courage
or
charity
much
as
they
would
pay
a
fine
in
expiation
of
daily
on
parade
their
works
are
done
as
an
apology
or
extenuation
of
their
living
in
the
world
as
invalids
and
the
insane
pay
a
high
board
their
virtues
are
penances
i
do
not
wish
to
expiate
but
to
live
my
life
is
for
itself
and
not
for
a
spectacle
i
much
prefer
that
it
should
be
of
a
lower
strain
so
it
be
genuine
and
equal
than
that
it
should
be
glittering
and
unsteady
i
wish
it
to
be
sound
and
sweet
and
not
to
need
diet
and
bleeding
i
ask
primary
evidence
that
you
are
a
man
and
refuse
this
appeal
from
the
man
to
his
actions
i
know
that
for
myself
it
makes
no
difference
whether
i
do
or
forbear
those
actions
which
are
reckoned
excellent
i
can
not
consent
to
pay
for
a
privilege
where
i
have
intrinsic
right
few
and
mean
as
my
gifts
may
be
i
actually
am
and
do
not
need
for
my
own
assurance
or
the
assurance
of
my
fellows
any
secondary
testimony
what
i
must
do
is
all
that
concerns
me
not
what
the
people
think
this
rule
equally
arduous
in
actual
and
in
intellectual
life
may
serve
for
the
whole
distinction
between
greatness
and
meanness
it
is
the
harder
because
you
will
always
find
those
who
think
they
know
what
is
your
duty
better
than
you
know
it
it
is
easy
in
the
world
to
live
after
the
world
opinion
it
is
easy
in
solitude
to
live
after
our
own
but
the
great
man
is
he
who
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
keeps
with
perfect
sweetness
the
independence
of
solitude
the
objection
to
conforming
to
usages
that
have
become
dead
to
you
is
that
it
scatters
your
force
it
loses
your
time
and
blurs
the
impression
of
your
character
if
you
maintain
a
dead
church
contribute
to
a
dead
vote
with
a
great
party
either
for
the
government
or
against
it
spread
your
table
like
base
housekeepers
under
all
these
screens
i
have
difficulty
to
detect
the
precise
man
you
are
and
of
course
so
much
force
is
withdrawn
from
your
proper
life
but
do
your
work
and
i
shall
know
you
do
your
work
and
you
shall
reinforce
yourself
a
man
must
consider
what
a
is
this
game
of
conformity
if
i
know
your
sect
i
anticipate
your
argument
i
hear
a
preacher
announce
for
his
text
and
topic
the
expediency
of
one
of
the
institutions
of
his
church
do
i
not
know
beforehand
that
not
possibly
can
he
say
a
new
and
spontaneous
word
do
i
not
know
that
with
all
this
ostentation
of
examining
the
grounds
of
the
institution
he
will
do
no
such
thing
do
i
not
know
that
he
is
pledged
to
himself
not
to
look
but
at
one
side
the
permitted
side
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
parish
minister
he
is
a
retained
attorney
and
these
airs
of
the
bench
are
the
emptiest
affectation
well
most
men
have
bound
their
eyes
with
one
or
another
handkerchief
and
attached
themselves
to
some
one
of
these
communities
of
opinion
this
conformity
makes
them
not
false
in
a
few
particulars
authors
of
a
few
lies
but
false
in
all
particulars
their
every
truth
is
not
quite
true
their
two
is
not
the
real
two
their
four
not
the
real
four
so
that
every
word
they
say
chagrins
us
and
we
know
not
where
to
begin
to
set
them
right
meantime
nature
is
not
slow
to
equip
us
in
the
of
the
party
to
which
we
adhere
we
come
to
wear
one
cut
of
face
and
figure
and
acquire
by
degrees
the
gentlest
asinine
expression
there
is
a
mortifying
experience
in
particular
which
does
not
fail
to
wreak
itself
also
in
the
general
history
i
mean
the
foolish
face
of
praise
the
forced
smile
which
we
put
on
in
company
where
we
do
not
feel
at
ease
in
answer
to
conversation
which
does
not
interest
us
the
muscles
not
spontaneously
moved
but
moved
by
a
low
usurping
willfulness
grow
tight
about
the
outline
of
the
face
with
the
most
disagreeable
sensation
for
nonconformity
the
world
whips
you
with
its
displeasure
and
therefore
a
man
must
know
how
to
estimate
a
sour
face
the
bystanders
look
askance
on
him
in
the
public
street
or
in
the
friend
parlor
if
this
aversation
had
its
origin
in
contempt
and
resistance
like
his
own
he
might
well
go
home
with
a
sad
countenance
but
the
sour
faces
of
the
multitude
like
their
sweet
faces
have
no
deep
cause
but
are
put
on
and
off
as
the
wind
blows
and
a
newspaper
directs
yet
is
the
discontent
of
the
multitude
more
formidable
than
that
of
the
senate
and
the
college
it
is
easy
enough
for
a
firm
man
who
knows
the
world
to
brook
the
rage
of
the
cultivated
classes
their
rage
is
decorous
and
prudent
for
they
are
timid
as
being
very
vulnerable
themselves
but
when
to
their
feminine
rage
the
indignation
of
the
people
is
added
when
the
ignorant
and
the
poor
are
aroused
when
the
unintelligent
brute
force
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
society
is
made
to
growl
and
mow
it
needs
the
habit
of
magnanimity
and
religion
to
treat
it
godlike
as
a
trifle
of
no
concernment
the
other
terror
that
scares
us
from
is
our
consistency
a
reverence
for
our
past
act
or
word
because
the
eyes
of
others
have
no
other
data
for
computing
our
orbit
than
our
past
acts
and
we
are
loth
to
disappoint
them
but
why
should
you
keep
your
head
over
your
shoulder
why
drag
about
this
corpse
of
your
memory
lest
you
contradict
somewhat
you
have
stated
in
this
or
that
public
place
suppose
you
should
contradict
yourself
what
then
it
seems
to
be
a
rule
of
wisdom
never
to
rely
on
your
memory
alone
scarcely
even
in
acts
of
pure
memory
but
to
bring
the
past
for
judgment
into
the
present
and
live
ever
in
a
new
day
in
your
metaphysics
you
have
denied
personality
to
the
deity
yet
when
the
devout
motions
of
the
soul
come
yield
to
them
heart
and
life
though
they
should
clothe
god
with
shape
and
color
leave
your
theory
as
joseph
his
coat
in
the
hand
of
the
harlot
and
flee
a
foolish
consistency
is
the
hobgoblin
of
little
minds
adored
by
little
statesmen
and
philosophers
and
divines
with
consistency
a
great
soul
has
simply
nothing
to
do
he
may
as
well
concern
himself
with
the
shadow
on
the
wall
speak
what
you
think
now
in
hard
words
and
speak
what
thinks
in
hard
words
again
though
it
contradict
everything
you
said
ah
so
you
shall
be
sure
to
be
misunderstood
is
it
so
bad
then
to
be
misunderstood
pythagoras
was
misunderstood
and
socrates
and
jesus
and
luther
and
copernicus
and
galileo
and
newton
and
every
pure
and
wise
spirit
that
ever
took
flesh
to
be
great
is
to
be
misunderstood
i
suppose
no
man
can
violate
his
nature
all
the
sallies
of
his
will
are
rounded
in
by
the
law
of
his
being
as
the
inequalities
of
andes
and
himmaleh
are
insignificant
in
the
curve
of
the
sphere
nor
does
it
matter
how
you
gauge
and
try
him
a
character
is
like
an
acrostic
or
alexandrian
stanza
read
it
forward
backward
or
across
it
still
spells
the
same
thing
in
this
pleasing
contrite
which
god
allows
me
let
me
record
day
by
day
my
honest
thought
without
prospect
or
retrospect
and
i
can
not
doubt
it
will
be
found
symmetrical
though
i
mean
it
not
and
see
it
not
my
book
should
smell
of
pines
and
resound
with
the
hum
of
insects
the
swallow
over
my
window
should
interweave
that
thread
or
straw
he
carries
in
his
bill
into
my
web
also
we
pass
for
what
we
are
character
teaches
above
our
wills
men
imagine
that
they
communicate
their
virtue
or
vice
only
by
overt
actions
and
do
not
see
that
virtue
or
vice
emit
a
breath
every
moment
there
will
be
an
agreement
in
whatever
variety
of
actions
so
they
be
each
honest
and
natural
in
their
hour
for
of
one
will
the
actions
will
be
harmonious
however
unlike
they
seem
these
varieties
are
lost
sight
of
at
a
little
distance
at
a
little
height
of
thought
one
tendency
unites
them
all
the
voyage
of
the
best
ship
is
a
zigzag
line
of
a
hundred
tacks
see
the
line
from
a
sufficient
distance
and
it
straightens
itself
to
the
average
tendency
your
genuine
action
will
explain
itself
and
will
explain
your
other
genuine
actions
your
conformity
explains
nothing
act
singly
and
what
you
have
already
done
singly
will
justify
you
now
greatness
appeals
to
the
future
if
i
can
be
firm
enough
to
do
right
and
scorn
eyes
i
must
have
done
so
much
right
before
as
to
defend
me
now
be
it
how
it
will
do
right
now
always
scorn
appearances
and
you
always
may
the
force
of
character
is
cumulative
all
the
foregone
days
of
virtue
work
their
health
into
this
what
makes
the
majesty
of
the
heroes
of
the
senate
and
the
field
which
so
fills
the
imagination
the
consciousness
of
a
train
of
great
days
and
victories
behind
they
shed
an
united
light
on
the
advancing
actor
he
is
attended
as
by
a
visible
escort
of
angels
that
is
it
which
throws
thunder
into
chatham
voice
and
dignity
into
washington
port
and
america
into
adams
eye
honor
is
venerable
to
us
because
it
is
no
ephemeris
it
is
always
ancient
virtue
we
worship
it
because
it
is
not
of
we
love
it
and
pay
it
homage
because
it
is
not
a
trap
for
our
love
and
homage
but
is
and
therefore
of
an
old
immaculate
pedigree
even
if
shown
in
a
young
person
i
hope
in
these
days
we
have
heard
the
last
of
conformity
and
consistency
let
the
words
be
gazetted
and
ridiculous
henceforward
instead
of
the
gong
for
dinner
let
us
hear
a
whistle
from
the
spartan
fife
let
us
never
bow
and
apologize
more
a
great
man
is
coming
to
eat
at
my
house
i
do
not
wish
to
please
him
i
wish
that
he
should
wish
to
please
me
i
will
stand
here
for
humanity
and
though
i
would
make
it
kind
i
would
make
it
true
let
us
affront
and
reprimand
the
smooth
mediocrity
and
squalid
contentment
of
the
times
and
hurl
in
the
face
of
custom
and
trade
and
office
the
fact
which
is
the
upshot
of
all
history
that
there
is
a
great
responsible
thinker
and
actor
working
wherever
a
man
works
that
a
true
man
belongs
to
no
other
time
or
place
but
is
the
center
of
things
where
he
is
there
is
nature
he
measures
you
and
all
men
and
all
events
ordinarily
everybody
in
society
reminds
us
of
somewhat
else
or
of
some
other
person
character
reality
reminds
you
of
nothing
else
it
takes
place
of
the
whole
creation
the
man
must
be
so
much
that
he
must
make
all
circumstances
indifferent
every
true
man
is
a
cause
a
country
and
an
age
requires
infinite
spaces
and
numbers
and
time
fully
to
accomplish
his
design
and
posterity
seem
to
follow
his
steps
as
a
train
of
clients
a
man
cæsar
is
born
and
for
ages
after
we
have
a
roman
empire
christ
is
born
and
millions
of
minds
so
grow
and
cleave
to
his
genius
that
he
is
confounded
with
virtue
and
the
possible
of
man
an
institution
is
the
lengthened
shadow
of
one
man
as
monachism
of
the
hermit
antony
the
reformation
of
luther
quakerism
of
fox
methodism
of
wesley
abolition
of
clarkson
scipio
milton
called
the
height
of
rome
and
all
history
resolves
itself
very
easily
into
the
biography
of
a
few
stout
and
earnest
persons
let
a
man
then
know
his
worth
and
keep
things
under
his
feet
let
him
not
peep
or
steal
or
skulk
up
and
down
with
the
air
of
a
a
bastard
or
an
interloper
in
the
world
which
exists
for
him
but
the
man
in
the
street
finding
no
worth
in
himself
which
corresponds
to
the
force
which
built
a
tower
or
sculptured
a
marble
god
feels
poor
when
he
looks
on
these
to
him
a
palace
a
statue
a
costly
book
have
an
alien
and
forbidding
air
much
like
a
gay
equipage
and
seem
to
say
like
that
who
are
you
sir
yet
they
all
are
his
suitors
for
his
notice
petitioners
to
his
faculties
that
they
will
come
out
and
take
possession
the
picture
waits
for
my
verdict
it
is
not
to
command
me
but
i
am
to
settle
its
claims
to
praise
that
popular
fable
of
the
sot
who
was
picked
up
dead
drunk
in
the
street
carried
to
the
duke
house
washed
and
dressed
and
laid
in
the
duke
bed
and
on
his
waking
treated
with
all
obsequious
ceremony
like
the
duke
and
assured
that
he
had
been
insane
owes
its
popularity
to
the
fact
that
it
symbolizes
so
well
the
state
of
man
who
is
in
the
world
a
sort
of
sot
but
now
and
then
wakes
up
exercises
his
reason
and
finds
himself
a
true
prince
our
reading
is
mendicant
and
sycophantic
in
history
our
imagination
plays
us
false
kingdom
and
lordship
power
and
estate
are
a
gaudier
vocabulary
than
private
john
and
edward
in
a
small
house
and
common
day
work
but
the
things
of
life
are
the
same
to
both
the
sum
total
of
both
is
the
same
why
all
this
deference
to
alfred
and
scanderbeg
and
gustavus
suppose
they
were
virtuous
did
they
wear
out
virtue
as
great
a
stake
depends
on
your
private
act
as
followed
their
public
and
renowned
steps
when
private
men
shall
act
with
original
views
the
luster
will
be
transferred
from
the
actions
of
kings
to
those
of
gentlemen
the
world
has
been
instructed
by
its
kings
who
have
so
magnetized
the
eyes
of
nations
it
has
been
taught
by
this
colossal
symbol
the
mutual
reverence
that
is
due
from
man
to
man
the
joyful
loyalty
with
which
men
have
everywhere
suffered
the
king
the
noble
or
the
great
proprietor
to
walk
among
them
by
a
law
of
his
own
make
his
own
scale
of
men
and
things
and
reverse
theirs
pay
for
benefits
not
with
money
but
with
honor
and
represent
the
law
in
his
person
was
the
hieroglyphic
by
which
they
obscurely
signified
their
consciousness
of
their
own
right
and
comeliness
the
right
of
every
man
the
magnetism
which
all
original
action
exerts
is
explained
when
we
inquire
the
reason
of
who
is
the
trustee
what
is
the
aboriginal
self
on
which
a
universal
reliance
may
be
grounded
what
is
the
nature
and
power
of
that
star
without
parallax
without
calculable
elements
which
shoots
a
ray
of
beauty
even
into
trivial
and
impure
actions
if
the
least
mark
of
independence
appear
the
inquiry
leads
us
to
that
source
at
once
the
essence
of
genius
of
virtue
and
of
life
which
we
call
spontaneity
or
instinct
we
denote
this
primary
wisdom
as
intuition
whilst
all
later
teachings
are
tuitions
in
that
deep
force
the
last
fact
behind
which
analysis
can
not
go
all
things
find
their
common
origin
for
the
sense
of
being
which
in
calm
hours
rises
we
know
not
how
in
the
soul
is
not
diverse
from
things
from
space
from
light
from
time
from
man
but
one
with
them
and
proceeds
obviously
from
the
same
source
whence
their
life
and
being
also
proceed
we
first
share
the
life
by
which
things
exist
and
afterwards
see
them
as
appearances
in
nature
and
forget
that
we
have
shared
their
cause
here
is
the
fountain
of
action
and
of
thought
here
are
the
lungs
of
that
inspiration
which
giveth
man
wisdom
and
which
can
not
be
denied
without
impiety
and
atheism
we
lie
in
the
lap
of
immense
intelligence
which
makes
us
receivers
of
its
truth
and
organs
of
its
activity
when
we
discern
justice
when
we
discern
truth
we
do
nothing
of
ourselves
but
allow
a
passage
to
its
beams
if
we
ask
whence
this
comes
if
we
seek
to
pry
into
the
soul
that
causes
all
philosophy
is
at
fault
its
presence
or
its
absence
is
all
we
can
affirm
every
man
discriminates
between
the
voluntary
acts
of
his
mind
and
his
involuntary
perceptions
and
knows
that
to
his
involuntary
perceptions
a
perfect
faith
is
due
he
may
err
in
the
expression
of
them
but
he
knows
that
these
things
are
so
like
day
and
night
not
to
be
disputed
my
willful
actions
and
acquisitions
are
but
roving
the
idlest
reverie
the
faintest
native
emotion
command
my
curiosity
and
respect
thoughtless
people
contradict
as
readily
the
statement
of
perceptions
as
of
opinions
or
rather
much
more
readily
for
they
do
not
distinguish
between
perception
and
notion
they
fancy
that
i
choose
to
see
this
or
that
thing
but
perception
is
not
whimsical
it
is
fatal
if
i
see
a
trait
my
children
will
see
it
after
me
and
in
course
of
time
all
mankind
although
it
may
chance
that
no
one
has
seen
it
before
me
for
my
perception
of
it
is
as
much
a
fact
as
the
sun
the
relations
of
the
soul
to
the
divine
spirit
are
so
pure
that
it
is
profane
to
seek
to
interpose
helps
it
must
be
that
when
god
speaketh
he
should
communicate
not
one
thing
but
all
things
should
fill
the
world
with
his
voice
should
scatter
forth
light
nature
time
souls
from
the
center
of
the
present
thought
and
new
date
and
new
create
the
whole
whenever
a
mind
is
simple
and
receives
a
divine
wisdom
old
things
pass
away
means
teachers
texts
temples
fall
it
lives
now
and
absorbs
past
and
future
into
the
present
hour
all
things
are
made
sacred
by
relation
to
it
one
as
much
as
another
all
things
are
dissolved
to
their
center
by
their
cause
and
in
the
universal
miracle
petty
and
particular
miracles
disappear
if
therefore
a
man
claims
to
know
and
speak
of
god
and
carries
you
backward
to
the
phraseology
of
some
old
moldered
nation
in
another
country
in
another
world
believe
him
not
is
the
acorn
better
than
the
oak
which
is
its
fullness
and
completion
is
the
parent
better
than
the
child
into
whom
he
has
cast
his
ripened
being
whence
then
this
worship
of
the
past
the
centuries
are
conspirators
against
the
sanity
and
authority
of
the
soul
time
and
space
are
but
physiological
colors
which
the
eye
makes
but
the
soul
is
light
where
it
is
is
day
where
it
was
is
night
and
history
is
an
impertinence
and
an
injury
if
it
be
anything
more
than
a
cheerful
apologue
or
parable
of
my
being
and
becoming
man
is
timid
and
apologetic
he
is
no
longer
upright
he
dares
not
say
i
think
i
am
but
quotes
some
saint
or
sage
he
is
ashamed
before
the
blade
of
grass
or
the
blowing
rose
these
roses
under
my
window
make
no
reference
to
former
roses
or
to
better
ones
they
are
for
what
they
are
they
exist
with
god
there
is
no
time
to
them
there
is
simply
the
rose
it
is
perfect
in
every
moment
of
its
existence
before
a
has
burst
its
whole
life
acts
in
the
flower
there
is
no
more
in
the
leafless
root
there
is
no
less
its
nature
is
satisfied
and
it
satisfies
nature
in
all
moments
alike
but
man
postpones
or
remembers
he
does
not
live
in
the
present
but
with
a
reverted
eye
laments
the
past
or
heedless
of
the
riches
that
surround
him
stands
on
tiptoe
to
foresee
the
future
he
can
not
be
happy
and
strong
until
he
too
lives
with
nature
in
the
present
above
time
this
should
be
plain
enough
yet
see
what
strong
intellects
dare
not
yet
hear
god
himself
unless
he
speak
the
phraseology
of
i
know
not
what
david
or
jeremiah
or
paul
we
shall
not
always
set
so
great
a
price
on
a
few
texts
on
a
few
lives
we
are
like
children
who
repeat
by
rote
the
sentences
of
grandames
and
tutors
and
as
they
grow
older
of
the
men
and
talents
and
characters
they
chance
to
see
painfully
recollecting
the
exact
words
they
spoke
afterwards
when
they
come
into
the
point
of
view
which
those
had
who
uttered
those
saying
they
understand
them
and
are
willing
to
let
the
words
go
for
at
any
time
they
can
use
words
as
good
when
occasion
comes
if
we
live
truly
we
shall
see
truly
it
is
as
easy
for
the
strong
man
to
be
strong
as
it
is
for
the
weak
to
be
weak
when
we
have
new
perception
we
shall
gladly
disburden
the
memory
of
its
hoarded
treasures
as
old
rubbish
when
a
man
lives
with
god
his
voice
shall
be
as
sweet
as
the
murmur
of
the
brook
and
the
rustle
of
the
corn
and
now
at
last
the
highest
truth
on
this
subject
remains
unsaid
probably
can
not
be
said
for
all
that
we
say
is
the
remembering
of
the
intuition
that
thought
by
what
i
can
now
nearest
approach
to
say
it
is
this
when
good
is
near
you
when
you
have
life
in
yourself
it
is
not
by
any
known
or
accustomed
way
you
shall
not
discern
the
footprints
of
any
other
you
shall
not
see
the
face
of
man
you
shall
not
hear
any
name
the
way
the
thought
the
good
shall
be
wholly
strange
and
new
it
shall
exclude
example
and
experience
you
take
the
way
from
man
not
to
man
all
persons
that
ever
existed
are
its
forgotten
ministers
fear
and
hope
are
alike
beneath
it
there
is
somewhat
low
even
in
hope
in
the
hour
of
vision
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
called
gratitude
nor
properly
joy
the
soul
raised
over
passion
beholds
identity
and
eternal
causation
perceives
the
of
truth
and
right
and
calms
itself
with
knowing
that
all
things
go
well
vast
spaces
of
nature
the
atlantic
ocean
the
south
sea
long
intervals
of
time
years
centuries
are
of
no
account
this
which
i
think
and
feel
underlay
every
former
state
of
life
and
circumstances
as
it
does
underlie
my
present
and
what
is
called
life
and
what
is
called
death
life
only
avails
not
the
having
lived
power
ceases
in
the
instant
of
repose
it
resides
in
the
moment
of
transition
from
a
past
to
a
new
state
in
the
shooting
of
the
gulf
in
the
darting
to
an
aim
this
one
fact
the
world
hates
that
the
soul
for
that
forever
degrades
the
past
turns
all
riches
to
poverty
all
reputation
to
shame
confounds
the
saint
with
the
rogue
shoves
jesus
and
judas
equally
aside
why
then
do
we
prate
of
inasmuch
as
the
soul
is
present
there
will
be
power
not
confident
but
agent
to
talk
of
reliance
is
a
poor
external
way
of
speaking
speak
rather
of
that
which
relies
because
it
works
and
is
who
has
more
obedience
than
i
masters
me
though
he
should
not
raise
his
finger
round
him
i
must
revolve
by
the
gravitation
of
spirits
we
fancy
it
rhetoric
when
we
speak
of
eminent
virtue
we
do
not
yet
see
that
virtue
is
height
and
that
a
man
or
a
company
of
men
plastic
and
permeable
to
principles
by
the
law
of
nature
must
overpower
and
ride
all
cities
nations
kings
rich
men
poets
who
are
not
this
is
the
ultimate
fact
which
we
so
quickly
reach
on
this
as
on
every
topic
the
resolution
of
all
into
the
one
is
the
attribute
of
the
supreme
cause
and
it
constitutes
the
measure
of
good
by
the
degree
in
which
it
enters
into
all
lower
forms
all
things
real
are
so
by
so
much
virtue
as
they
contain
commerce
husbandry
hunting
whaling
war
eloquence
personal
weight
are
somewhat
and
engage
my
respect
as
examples
of
its
presence
and
impure
action
i
see
the
same
law
working
in
nature
for
conservation
and
growth
power
is
in
nature
the
essential
measure
of
right
nature
suffers
nothing
to
remain
in
her
kingdoms
which
can
not
help
itself
the
genesis
and
maturation
of
a
planet
its
poise
and
orbit
the
bended
tree
recovering
itself
from
the
strong
wind
the
vital
resources
of
every
animal
and
vegetable
are
demonstrations
of
the
and
therefore
soul
thus
all
concentrates
let
us
not
rove
let
us
sit
at
home
with
the
cause
let
us
stun
and
astonish
the
intruding
rabble
of
men
and
books
and
institutions
by
a
simple
declaration
of
the
divine
fact
bid
the
invaders
take
the
shoes
from
off
their
feet
for
god
is
here
within
let
our
simplicity
judge
them
and
our
docility
to
our
own
law
demonstrate
the
poverty
of
nature
and
fortune
beside
our
native
riches
but
now
we
are
a
mob
man
does
not
stand
in
awe
of
man
nor
is
his
genius
admonished
to
stay
at
home
to
put
itself
in
communication
with
the
internal
ocean
but
it
goes
abroad
to
beg
a
cup
of
water
of
the
urns
of
other
men
we
must
go
alone
i
like
the
silent
church
before
the
service
begins
better
than
any
preaching
how
far
off
how
cool
how
chaste
the
persons
look
begirt
each
one
with
a
precinct
or
sanctuary
so
let
us
always
sit
why
should
we
assume
the
faults
of
our
friend
or
wife
or
father
or
child
because
they
sit
around
our
hearth
or
are
said
to
have
the
same
blood
all
men
have
my
blood
and
i
have
all
men
not
for
that
will
i
adopt
their
petulance
or
folly
even
to
the
extent
of
being
ashamed
of
it
but
your
isolation
must
not
be
mechanical
but
spiritual
that
is
must
be
elevation
at
times
the
whole
world
seems
to
be
in
conspiracy
to
importune
you
with
emphatic
trifles
friend
client
child
sickness
fear
want
charity
all
knock
at
once
at
thy
closet
door
and
say
come
out
unto
us
but
keep
thy
state
come
not
into
their
confusion
the
power
men
possess
to
annoy
men
i
give
them
by
a
weak
curiosity
no
man
can
come
near
me
but
through
my
act
what
we
love
that
we
have
but
by
desire
we
bereave
ourselves
of
the
love
if
we
can
not
at
once
rise
to
the
sanctities
of
obedience
and
faith
let
us
at
least
resist
our
temptations
let
us
enter
into
the
state
of
war
and
wake
thor
and
woden
courage
and
constancy
in
our
saxon
breasts
this
is
to
be
done
in
our
smooth
times
by
speaking
the
truth
check
this
lying
hospitality
and
lying
affection
live
no
longer
to
the
expectation
of
these
deceived
and
deceiving
people
with
whom
we
converse
say
to
them
o
father
o
mother
o
wife
o
brother
o
friend
i
have
lived
with
you
after
appearances
hitherto
henceforward
i
am
the
truth
be
it
known
unto
you
that
henceforward
i
obey
no
law
less
than
the
eternal
law
i
will
have
no
covenants
but
proximities
i
shall
endeavor
to
nourish
my
parents
to
support
my
family
to
be
the
chaste
husband
of
one
wife
but
these
relations
i
must
fill
after
a
new
and
unprecedented
way
i
appeal
from
your
customs
i
must
be
myself
i
can
not
break
myself
any
longer
for
you
or
you
if
you
can
love
me
for
what
i
am
we
shall
be
the
happier
if
you
can
not
i
will
still
seek
to
deserve
that
you
should
i
will
not
hide
my
tastes
or
aversions
i
will
so
trust
that
what
is
deep
is
holy
that
i
will
do
strongly
before
the
sun
and
moon
whatever
inly
rejoices
me
and
the
heart
appoints
if
you
are
noble
i
will
love
you
if
you
are
not
i
will
not
hurt
you
and
myself
by
hypocritical
attentions
if
you
are
true
but
not
in
the
same
truth
with
me
cleave
to
your
companions
i
will
seek
my
own
i
do
this
not
selfishly
but
humbly
and
truly
it
is
alike
your
interest
and
mine
and
all
men
however
long
we
have
dwelt
in
lies
to
live
in
truth
does
this
sound
harsh
you
will
soon
love
what
is
dictated
by
your
nature
as
well
as
mine
and
if
we
follow
the
truth
it
will
bring
us
out
safe
at
last
but
so
may
you
give
these
friends
pain
yes
but
i
can
not
sell
my
liberty
and
my
power
to
save
their
sensibility
besides
all
persons
have
their
moments
of
reason
when
they
look
out
into
the
region
of
absolute
truth
then
will
they
justify
me
and
do
the
same
thing
the
populace
think
that
your
rejection
of
popular
standards
is
a
rejection
of
all
standard
and
mere
antinomianism
and
the
bold
sensualist
will
use
the
name
of
philosophy
to
gild
his
crimes
but
the
law
of
consciousness
abides
there
are
two
confessionals
in
one
or
the
other
of
which
we
must
be
shriven
you
may
fulfill
your
round
of
duties
by
clearing
yourself
in
the
or
in
the
way
consider
whether
you
have
satisfied
your
relations
to
father
mother
cousin
neighbor
town
cat
and
dog
whether
any
of
these
can
upbraid
you
but
i
may
also
neglect
this
reflex
standard
and
absolve
me
to
myself
i
have
my
own
stern
claims
and
perfect
circle
it
denies
the
name
of
duty
to
many
offices
that
are
called
duties
but
if
i
can
discharge
its
debts
it
enables
me
to
dispense
with
the
popular
code
if
any
one
imagines
that
this
law
is
lax
let
him
keep
its
commandment
one
day
and
truly
it
demands
something
godlike
in
him
who
has
cast
off
the
common
motives
of
humanity
and
has
ventured
to
trust
himself
for
a
taskmaster
high
be
his
heart
faithful
his
will
clear
his
sight
that
he
may
in
good
earnest
be
doctrine
society
law
to
himself
that
a
simple
purpose
may
be
to
him
as
strong
as
iron
necessity
is
to
others
if
any
man
consider
the
present
aspects
of
what
is
called
by
distinction
he
will
see
the
need
of
these
ethics
the
sinew
and
heart
of
man
seem
to
be
drawn
out
and
we
are
become
timorous
desponding
whimperers
we
are
afraid
of
truth
afraid
of
fortune
afraid
of
death
and
afraid
of
each
other
our
age
yields
no
great
and
perfect
persons
we
want
men
and
women
who
shall
renovate
life
and
our
social
state
but
we
see
that
most
natures
are
insolvent
can
not
satisfy
their
own
wants
have
an
ambition
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
practical
force
and
do
lean
and
beg
day
and
night
continually
our
housekeeping
is
mendicant
our
arts
our
occupations
our
marriages
our
religion
we
have
not
chosen
but
society
has
chosen
for
us
we
are
parlor
soldiers
we
shun
the
rugged
battle
of
fate
where
strength
is
born
if
our
young
men
miscarry
in
their
first
enterprises
they
lose
all
heart
if
the
young
merchant
fails
men
say
he
is
if
the
finest
genius
studies
at
one
of
our
colleges
and
is
not
installed
in
an
office
within
one
year
afterwards
in
the
cities
or
suburbs
of
boston
or
new
york
it
seems
to
his
friends
and
to
himself
that
he
is
right
in
being
disheartened
and
in
complaining
the
rest
of
his
life
a
sturdy
lad
from
new
hampshire
or
vermont
who
in
turn
tries
all
the
professions
who
it
farms
keeps
a
school
preaches
edits
a
newspaper
goes
to
congress
buys
a
township
and
so
forth
in
successive
years
and
always
like
a
cat
falls
on
his
feet
is
worth
a
hundred
of
these
city
dolls
he
walks
abreast
with
his
days
and
feels
no
shame
in
not
studying
a
profession
for
he
does
not
postpone
his
life
but
lives
already
he
has
not
one
chance
but
a
hundred
chances
let
a
stoic
open
the
resources
of
man
and
tell
men
they
are
not
leaning
willows
but
can
and
must
detach
themselves
that
with
the
exercise
of
new
powers
shall
appear
that
a
man
is
the
word
made
flesh
born
to
shed
healing
to
the
nations
that
he
should
be
ashamed
of
our
compassion
and
that
the
moment
he
acts
from
himself
tossing
the
laws
the
books
idolatries
and
customs
out
of
the
window
we
pity
him
no
more
but
thank
and
revere
him
and
that
teacher
shall
restore
the
life
of
man
to
splendor
and
make
his
name
dear
to
all
history
it
is
easy
to
see
that
a
greater
must
work
a
revolution
in
all
the
offices
and
relations
of
men
in
their
religion
in
their
education
in
their
pursuits
their
modes
of
living
their
association
in
their
property
in
their
speculative
views
in
what
prayers
do
men
allow
themselves
that
which
they
call
a
holy
office
is
not
so
much
as
brave
and
manly
prayer
looks
abroad
and
asks
for
some
foreign
addition
to
come
through
some
foreign
virtue
and
loses
itself
in
endless
mazes
of
natural
and
supernatural
and
mediatorial
and
miraculous
prayer
that
craves
a
particular
commodity
anything
less
than
all
good
is
vicious
prayer
is
the
contemplation
of
the
facts
of
life
from
the
highest
point
of
view
it
is
the
soliloquy
of
a
beholding
and
jubilant
soul
it
is
the
spirit
of
god
pronouncing
his
works
good
but
prayer
as
a
means
to
effect
a
private
end
is
meanness
and
theft
it
supposes
dualism
and
not
unity
in
nature
and
consciousness
as
soon
as
the
man
is
at
one
with
god
he
will
not
beg
he
will
then
see
prayer
in
all
action
the
prayer
of
the
farmer
kneeling
in
his
field
to
weed
it
the
prayer
of
the
rower
kneeling
with
the
stroke
of
his
oar
are
true
prayers
heard
throughout
nature
though
for
cheap
ends
caratach
in
bonduca
when
admonished
to
inquire
the
mind
of
the
god
audate
replies
his
hidden
meaning
lies
in
our
endeavors
our
valors
are
our
best
gods
another
sort
of
false
prayers
are
our
regrets
discontent
is
the
want
of
it
is
infirmity
of
will
regret
calamities
if
you
can
thereby
help
the
sufferer
if
not
attend
your
own
work
and
already
the
evil
begins
to
be
repaired
our
sympathy
is
just
as
base
we
come
to
them
who
weep
foolishly
and
sit
down
and
cry
for
company
instead
of
imparting
to
them
truth
and
health
in
rough
electric
shocks
putting
them
once
more
in
communication
with
their
own
reason
the
secret
of
fortune
is
joy
in
our
hands
welcome
evermore
to
gods
and
men
is
the
man
for
him
all
doors
are
flung
wide
him
all
tongues
greet
all
honors
crown
all
eyes
follow
with
desire
our
love
goes
out
to
him
and
embraces
him
because
he
did
not
need
it
we
solicitously
and
apologetically
caress
and
celebrate
him
because
he
held
on
his
way
and
scorned
our
disapprobation
the
gods
love
him
because
men
hated
him
to
the
persevering
mortal
said
zoroaster
the
blessed
immortals
are
swift
as
men
prayers
are
a
disease
of
the
will
so
are
their
creeds
a
disease
of
the
intellect
they
say
with
those
foolish
israelites
let
not
god
speak
to
us
lest
we
die
speak
thou
speak
any
man
with
us
and
we
will
obey
everywhere
i
am
hindered
of
meeting
god
in
my
brother
because
he
has
shut
his
own
temple
doors
and
recites
fables
merely
of
his
brother
or
his

brother
god
every
new
mind
is
a
new
classification
if
it
prove
a
mind
of
uncommon
activity
and
power
a
locke
a
lavoisier
a
hutton
a
betham
a
fourier
it
imposes
its
classification
on
other
men
and
lo
a
new
system
in
proportion
to
the
depth
of
the
thought
and
so
to
the
number
of
the
objects
it
touches
and
brings
within
reach
of
the
pupil
is
his
complacency
but
chiefly
is
this
apparent
in
creeds
and
churches
which
are
also
classifications
of
some
powerful
mind
acting
on
the
elemental
thought
of
duty
and
man
relation
to
the
highest
such
is
calvinism
quakerism
swedenborgism
the
pupil
takes
the
same
delight
in
subordinating
everything
to
the
new
terminology
as
a
girl
who
has
just
learned
botany
in
seeing
a
new
earth
and
new
seasons
thereby
it
will
happen
for
a
time
that
the
pupil
will
find
his
intellectual
power
has
grown
by
the
study
of
his
master
mind
but
in
all
unbalanced
minds
the
classification
is
idolized
passes
for
the
end
and
not
for
a
speedily
exhaustible
means
so
that
the
walls
of
the
system
blend
to
their
eye
in
the
remote
horizon
with
the
walls
of
the
universe
the
luminaries
of
heaven
seem
to
them
hung
on
the
arch
their
master
built
they
can
not
imagine
how
you
aliens
have
any
right
to
see
how
you
can
see
it
must
be
somehow
that
you
stole
the
light
from
us
they
do
not
yet
perceive
that
light
unsystematic
indomitable
will
break
into
any
cabin
even
into
theirs
let
them
chirp
awhile
and
call
it
their
own
if
they
are
honest
and
do
well
presently
their
neat
new
pinfold
will
be
too
strait
and
low
will
crack
will
lean
will
rot
and
vanish
and
the
immortal
light
all
young
and
joyful
will
beam
over
the
universe
as
on
the
first
morning
it
is
for
want
of
that
the
superstition
of
traveling
whose
idols
are
italy
england
egypt
retains
its
fascination
for
all
educated
americans
they
who
made
england
italy
or
greece
venerable
in
the
imagination
did
so
by
sticking
fast
where
they
were
like
an
axis
of
the
earth
in
manly
hours
we
feel
that
duty
is
our
place
the
soul
is
no
traveler
the
wise
man
stays
at
home
and
when
his
necessities
his
duties
on
any
occasion
call
him
from
his
house
or
into
foreign
lands
he
is
at
home
still
and
shall
make
men
sensible
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
that
he
goes
the
missionary
of
wisdom
and
virtue
and
visits
cities
and
men
like
a
sovereign
and
not
like
an
interloper
or
a
valet
i
have
no
churlish
objection
to
the
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
for
the
purposes
of
art
of
study
and
benevolence
so
that
the
man
is
first
domesticated
or
does
not
go
abroad
with
the
hope
of
finding
somewhat
greater
than
he
knows
he
who
travels
to
be
amused
or
to
get
somewhat
which
he
does
not
carry
travels
away
from
himself
and
grows
old
even
in
youth
among
old
things
in
thebes
in
palmyra
his
will
and
mind
have
become
old
and
dilapidated
as
they
he
carries
ruins
to
ruins
traveling
is
a
fool
paradise
our
first
journeys
discover
to
us
the
indifference
of
places
at
home
i
dream
that
at
naples
at
rome
i
can
be
intoxicated
with
beauty
and
lose
my
sadness
i
pack
my
trunk
embrace
my
friends
embark
on
the
sea
and
at
last
wake
up
in
naples
and
there
beside
me
is
the
stern
fact
the
sad
self
unrelenting
identical
that
i
fled
from
i
seek
the
vatican
and
the
palaces
i
affect
to
be
intoxicated
with
sights
and
suggestions
but
i
am
not
intoxicated
my
giant
goes
with
me
wherever
i
go
but
the
rage
of
traveling
is
a
symptom
of
a
deeper
unsoundness
affecting
the
whole
intellectual
action
the
intellect
is
vagabond
and
our
system
of
education
fosters
restlessness
our
minds
travel
when
our
bodies
are
forced
to
stay
at
home
we
imitate
and
what
is
imitation
but
the
traveling
of
the
mind
our
houses
are
built
with
foreign
taste
our
shelves
are
garnished
with
foreign
ornaments
our
opinions
our
tastes
our
faculties
lean
and
follow
the
past
and
the
distant
the
soul
created
the
arts
wherever
they
have
flourished
it
was
in
his
own
mind
that
the
artist
sought
his
model
it
was
an
application
of
his
own
thought
to
the
thing
to
be
done
and
the
conditions
to
be
observed
and
why
need
we
copy
the
doric
or
the
gothic
model
beauty
convenience
grandeur
of
thought
and
quaint
expression
are
as
near
to
us
as
to
any
and
if
the
american
artist
will
study
with
hope
and
love
the
precise
thing
to
be
done
by
him
considering
the
climate
the
soil
the
length
of
the
day
the
wants
of
the
people
the
habit
and
form
of
the
government
he
will
create
a
house
in
which
all
these
will
find
themselves
fitted
and
taste
and
sentiment
will
be
satisfied
also
insist
on
yourself
never
imitate
your
own
gift
you
can
present
every
moment
with
the
cumulative
force
of
a
whole
life
cultivation
but
of
the
adopted
talent
of
another
you
have
only
an
extemporaneous
half
possession
that
which
each
can
do
best
none
but
his
maker
can
teach
him
no
man
yet
knows
what
it
is
nor
can
till
that
person
has
exhibited
it
where
is
the
master
who
could
have
taught
shakespeare
where
is
the
master
who
could
have
instructed
franklin
or
washington
or
bacon
or
newton
every
great
man
is
a
unique
the
scipionism
of
scipio
is
precisely
that
part
he
could
not
borrow
shakespeare
will
never
be
made
by
the
study
of
shakespeare
do
that
which
is
assigned
to
you
and
you
can
not
hope
too
much
or
dare
too
much
there
is
at
this
moment
for
you
an
utterance
brave
and
grand
as
that
of
the
colossal
chisel
of
phidias
or
trowel
of
the
egyptians
or
the
pen
of
moses
or
dante
but
different
from
all
these
not
possibly
will
the
soul
all
rich
all
eloquent
with
tongue
deign
to
repeat
itself
but
if
you
can
hear
what
these
patriarchs
say
surely
you
can
reply
to
them
in
the
same
pitch
of
voice
for
the
ear
and
the
tongue
are
two
organs
of
one
nature
abide
in
the
simple
and
noble
regions
of
thy
life
obey
thy
heart
and
thou
shalt
reproduce
the
foreworld
again
as
our
religion
our
education
our
art
look
abroad
so
does
our
spirit
of
society
all
men
plume
themselves
on
the
improvement
of
society
and
no
man
improves
society
never
advances
it
recedes
as
fast
on
one
side
as
it
gains
on
the
other
it
undergoes
continual
changes
it
is
barbarous
it
is
civilized
it
is
christianized
it
is
rich
it
is
scientific
but
this
change
is
not
amelioration
for
everything
that
is
given
something
is
taken
society
acquires
new
arts
and
loses
old
instincts
what
a
contrast
between
the
reading
writing
thinking
american
with
a
watch
a
pencil
and
a
bill
of
exchange
in
his
pocket
and
the
naked
new
zealander
whose
property
is
a
club
a
spear
a
mat
and
an
undivided
twentieth
of
a
shed
to
sleep
under
but
compare
the
health
of
the
two
men
and
you
shall
see
that
the
white
man
has
lost
his
aboriginal
strength
if
the
traveler
tell
us
truly
strike
the
savage
with
a
broad
ax
and
in
a
day
or
two
the
flesh
shall
unite
and
heal
as
if
you
struck
the
blow
into
soft
pitch
and
the
same
blow
shall
send
the
white
to
his
grave
the
civilized
man
has
built
a
coach
but
has
lost
the
use
of
his
feet
he
is
supported
on
crutches
but
lacks
so
much
support
of
muscle
he
has
a
fine
geneva
watch
but
he
fails
of
the
skill
to
tell
the
hour
by
the
sun
a
greenwich
nautical
almanac
he
has
and
so
being
sure
of
the
information
when
he
wants
it
the
man
in
the
street
does
not
know
a
star
in
the
sky
the
solstice
he
does
not
observe
the
equinox
he
knows
as
little
and
the
whole
bright
calendar
of
the
year
is
without
a
dial
in
his
mind
his
notebooks
impair
his
memory
his
libraries
overload
his
wit
the
insurance
office
increases
the
number
of
accidents
and
it
may
be
a
question
whether
machinery
does
not
encumber
whether
we
have
not
lost
by
refinement
some
energy
by
a
christianity
entrenched
in
establishments
and
forms
some
vigor
of
wild
virtue
for
every
stoic
was
a
stoic
but
in
christendom
where
is
the
christian
there
is
no
more
deviation
in
the
moral
standard
than
in
the
standard
of
height
or
bulk
no
greater
men
are
now
than
ever
were
a
singular
equality
may
be
observed
between
great
men
of
the
first
and
of
the
last
ages
nor
can
all
the
science
art
religion
and
philosophy
of
the
nineteenth
century
avail
to
educate
greater
men
than
plutarch
heroes
three
or
four
and
twenty
centuries
ago
not
in
time
is
the
race
progressive
phocion
socrates
anaxagoras
diogenes
are
great
men
but
they
leave
no
class
he
who
is
really
of
their
class
will
not
be
called
by
their
name
but
will
be
his
own
man
and
in
his
turn
the
founder
of
a
sect
the
arts
and
inventions
of
each
period
are
only
its
costume
and
do
not
invigorate
men
the
harm
of
the
improved
machinery
may
compensate
its
good
hudson

accomplished
so
much
in
their
fishing

as
to
astonish

of

than
any
one
since
columbus
found
the
new
world
in
an
undecked
boat
it
is
curious
to
see
the
periodical
disuse
and
perishing
of
means
and
machinery
which
were
introduced
with
loud
laudation
a
few
years
or
centuries
before
the
great
genius
returns
to
essential
man
we
reckoned
the
improvements
of
the
art
of
war
among
the
triumphs
of
science
and
yet
napoleon
conquered

by
the
bivouac
which
consisted
of
falling
back
on

valor
and
disencumbering
it
of

the
emperor
held
it
impossible
to
make
a
perfect
army
says
las

without
abolishing
our
arms
magazines
commissaries
and

until
in
imitation
of
the
roman
custom
the
soldier
should
receive
his
supply
of
corn
grind
it
in
his
handmill
and
bake
his
bread
himself
society
is
a
wave
the
wave
moves
onward
but
the
water
of
which
it
is
composed
does
not
the
same
particle
does
not
rise
from
the
valley
to
the
ridge
its
unity
is
only
phenomenal
the
persons
who
make
up
a
nation
next
year
die
and
their
experience
with
them
and
so
the
reliance
on
property
including
the
reliance
on
governments
which
protect
it
is
the
want
of
men
have
looked
away
from
themselves
and
at
things
so
long
that
they
have
come
to
esteem
the
religious
learned
and
civil
institutions
as
guards
of
property
and
they
deprecate
assaults
on
these
because
they
feel
them
to
be
assaults
on
property
they
measure
their
esteem
of
each
other
by
what
each
has
and
not
by
what
each
is
but
a
cultivated
man
becomes
ashamed
of
his
property
out
of
new
respect
for
his
nature
especially
he
hates
what
he
has
if
he
see
that
it
is
accidental
came
to
him
by
inheritance
or
gift
or
crime
then
he
feels
that
it
is
not
having
it
does
not
belong
to
him
has
no
root
in
him
and
merely
lies
there
because
no
revolution
or
no
robber
takes
it
away
but
that
which
a
man
is
does
always
by
necessity
acquire
and
what
the
man
acquires
is
living
property
which
does
not
wait
the
beck
of
rulers
or
mobs
or
revolutions
or
fire
or
storm
or
bankruptcies
but
perpetually
renews
itself
wherever
the
man
breathes
thy
lot
or
portion
of
life

therefore
be
at

from

our
dependence
on
these
foreign
goods
leads
us
to
our
slavish
respect
for
numbers
the

with

the

himself

in

not
so

will
the

deign
to
enter

you
but
by
a
method
precisely
the
reverse
it
is
only
as
a
man
puts
off
all
foreign
support
and
stands
alone
that
i
see
him
to
be
strong
and
to
prevail
he
is
weaker
by
every
recruit
to
his

not
a

in
the
endless

he
who
knows

that

commands
his
limbs
works
miracles
just
as
a
man
who
stands
on
his
feet
is
stronger
than
a
man
who
stands
on
his
head
so
use
all
that
is
called
fortune
most
men
gamble
with
her
and
gain
all
and
lose
all
as
her
wheel
rolls
but
do
thou
leave
as
unlawful
these
winnings
and
deal
with
cause
and
effect
the
chancelors
of
god
in
the
will
work
and
acquire
and
thou
hast
chained
the
wheel
of
chance
and
shalt
sit
hereafter
out
of
fear
from
her
rotations
a
political
victory
a
rise
of
rents
the
recovery
of
your
sick
or
the
return
of
your
absent
friend
or
some
other
favorable
event
raises
your
spirits
and
you
think
good
days
are
preparing
for
you
do
not
believe
it
nothing
can
bring
you
peace
but
yourself
nothing
can
bring
you
peace
but
the
triumph
of
principles
friendship
we
have
a
great
deal
more
kindness
than
is
ever
spoken
barring
all
the
selfishness
that
chills
like
east
winds
the
world
the
whole
human
family
is
bathed
with
an
element
of
love
like
a
fine
ether
how
many
persons
we
meet
in
houses
whom
we
scarcely
speak
to
whom
yet
we
honor
and
who
honor
us
how
many
we
see
in
the
street
or
sit
with
in
church
whom
though
silently
we
warmly
rejoice
to
be
with
read
the
language
of
these
wandering
eyebeams
the
heart
knoweth
the
effect
of
the
indulgence
of
this
human
affection
is
a
certain
cordial
exhilaration
in
poetry
and
in
common
speech
the
emotions
of
benevolence
and
complacency
which
are
felt
toward
others
are
likened
to
the
material
effects
of
fire
so
swift
or
much
more
swift
more
active
more
cheering
are
these
fine
inward
irradiations
from
the
highest
degree
of
passionate
love
to
the
lowest
degree
of
good
will
they
make
the
sweetness
of
life
our
intellectual
and
active
powers
increase
with
our
affection
the
scholar
sits
down
to
write
and
all
his
years
of
meditation
do
not
furnish
him
with
one
good
thought
or
happy
expression
but
it
is
necessary
to
write
a
letter
to
a
friend
and
forthwith
troops
of
gentle
thoughts
invest
themselves
on
every
hand
with
chosen
words
see
in
any
house
where
virtue
and
abide
the
palpitation
which
the
approach
of
a
stranger
causes
a
commended
stranger
is
expected
and
announced
and
an
uneasiness
between
pleasure
and
pain
invades
all
the
hearts
of
a
household
his
arrival
almost
brings
fear
to
the
good
hearts
that
would
welcome
him
the
house
is
dusted
all
things
fly
into
their
places
the
old
coat
is
exchanged
for
the
new
and
they
must
get
up
a
dinner
if
they
can
of
a
commended
stranger
only
the
good
report
is
told
by
others
only
the
good
and
new
is
heard
by
us
he
stands
to
us
for
humanity
he
is
what
we
wish
having
imagined
and
invested
him
we
ask
how
we
should
stand
related
in
conversation
and
action
with
such
a
man
and
are
uneasy
with
fear
the
same
idea
exalts
conversation
with
him
we
talk
better
than
we
are
wont
we
have
the
nimblest
fancy
a
richer
memory
and
our
dumb
devil
has
taken
leave
for
the
time
for
long
hours
we
can
continue
a
series
of
sincere
graceful
rich
communications
drawn
from
the
oldest
secretest
experience
so
that
they
who
sit
by
of
our
own
kinsfolk
and
acquaintance
shall
feel
a
lively
surprise
at
our
unusual
powers
but
as
soon
as
the
stranger
begins
to
intrude
his
partialities
his
definitions
his
defects
into
the
conversation
it
is
all
over
he
has
heard
the
first
the
last
and
best
he
will
ever
hear
from
us
he
is
no
stranger
now
vulgarity
ignorance
misapprehension
are
old
acquaintances
now
when
he
comes
he
may
get
the
order
the
dress
and
the
dinner
but
the
throbbing
of
the
heart
and
the
communications
of
the
soul
no
more
what
is
so
pleasant
as
these
jets
of
affection
which
relume
a
young
world
for
me
again
what
is
so
delicious
as
a
just
and
firm
encounter
of
two
in
a
thought
in
a
feeling
how
beautiful
on
their
approach
to
this
beating
heart
the
steps
and
forms
of
the
gifted
and
the
true
the
moment
we
indulge
our
affections
the
earth
is
metamorphosed
there
is
no
winter
and
no
night
all
tragedies
all
ennuis
vanish
all
duties
even
nothing
fills
the
proceeding
eternity
but
the
forms
all
radiant
of
beloved
persons
let
the
soul
be
assured
that
somewhere
in
the
universe
it
should
rejoin
its
friend
and
it
would
be
content
and
cheerful
alone
for
a
thousand
years
i
awoke
this
morning
with
devout
thanksgiving
for
my
friends
the
old
and
the
new
shall
i
not
call
god
the
beautiful
who
daily
showeth
himself
so
to
me
in
his
gifts
i
chide
society
i
embrace
solitude
and
yet
i
am
not
so
ungrateful
as
not
to
see
the
wise
the
lovely
and
the
as
from
time
to
time
they
pass
my
gate
who
hears
me
who
understands
me
becomes
mine
a
possession
for
all
time
nor
is
nature
so
poor
but
she
gives
me
this
joy
several
times
and
thus
we
weave
social
threads
of
our
own
a
new
web
of
relations
and
as
many
thoughts
in
succession
substantiate
themselves
we
shall
stand
in
a
new
world
of
our
own
creation
and
no
longer
strangers
and
pilgrims
is
a
traditionary
globe
my
friends
have
come
to
me
unsought
the
great
god
gave
them
to
me
by
oldest
right
by
the
divine
affinity
of
virtue
with
itself
i
find
them
or
rather
not
i
but
the
deity
in
me
and
in
them
both
deride
and
cancel
the
thick
walls
of
individual
character
relation
age
sex
and
circumstance
at
which
he
usually
connives
and
now
makes
many
one
high
thanks
i
owe
you
excellent
lovers
who
carry
out
the
world
for
me
to
new
and
noble
depths
and
enlarge
the
meaning
of
all
my
thoughts
these
are
new
poetry
of
the
first
bard
poetry
without
stop
hymn
ode
and
epic
poetry
still
flowing
apollo
and
the
muses
chanting
still
will
these
two
separate
themselves
from
me
again
or
some
of
them
i
know
not
but
i
fear
it
not
for
my
relation
to
them
is
so
pure
that
we
hold
by
simple
affinity
and
the
genius
of
my
life
being
thus
social
the
same
affinity
will
exert
its
energy
on
whomsoever
is
as
noble
as
these
men
and
women
wherever
i
may
be
i
confess
to
an
extreme
tenderness
of
nature
on
this
point
it
is
almost
dangerous
to
me
to
crush
the
sweet
poison
of
misused
wine
of
the
affections
a
new
person
is
to
me
a
great
event
and
hinders
me
from
sleep
i
have
had
such
fine
fancies
lately
about
two
or
three
persons
as
have
given
me
delicious
hours
but
the
joy
ends
in
the
day
it
yields
no
fruit
thought
is
not
born
of
it
my
action
is
very
little
modified
i
must
feel
pride
in
my
accomplishments
as
if
they
were
mine
and
a
property
in
his
virtues
i
feel
as
warmly
when
he
is
praised
as
the
lover
when
he
hears
applause
of
his
engaged
maiden
we
the
conscience
of
our
friend
his
goodness
seems
better
than
our
goodness
his
nature
finer
his
temptations
less
everything
that
is
his
his
name
his
form
his
dress
books
and
instruments
fancy
enhances
our
own
thought
sounds
new
and
larger
from
his
mouth
yet
the
systole
and
diastole
of
the
heart
are
not
without
their
analogy
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
love
friendship
like
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
too
good
to
be
believed
the
lover
beholding
his
maiden
half
knows
that
she
is
not
verily
that
which
he
worships
and
in
the
golden
hour
of
friendship
we
are
surprised
with
shades
of
suspicion
and
unbelief
we
doubt
that
we
bestow
on
our
hero
the
virtues
in
which
he
shines
and
afterward
worship
the
form
to
which
we
have
ascribed
this
divine
inhabitation
in
strictness
the
soul
does
not
respect
men
as
it
respects
itself
in
strict
science
all
persons
underlie
the
same
condition
of
an
infinite
remoteness
shall
we
fear
to
cool
our
love
by
mining
for
the
metaphysical
foundation
of
this
elysian
temple
shall
i
not
be
as
real
as
the
things
i
see
if
i
am
i
shall
not
fear
to
know
them
for
what
they
are
their
essence
is
not
less
beautiful
than
their
appearance
though
it
needs
finer
organs
for
its
apprehension
the
root
of
the
plant
is
not
unsightly
to
science
though
for
chaplets
and
festoons
we
cut
the
stem
short
and
i
must
hazard
the
production
of
the
bald
fact
amid
these
pleasing
reveries
though
it
should
prove
an
egyptian
skull
at
our
banquet
a
man
who
stands
united
with
his
thought
conceives
magnificently
to
himself
he
is
conscious
of
a
universal
success
even
though
bought
by
uniform
particular
failures
no
advantages
no
powers
no
gold
or
force
can
be
any
match
for
him
i
can
not
choose
but
rely
on
my
own
poverty
more
than
on
your
wealth
i
can
not
make
your
consciousness
tantamount
to
mine
only
the
star
dazzles
the
planet
has
a
faint
ray
i
hear
what
you
say
of
the
admirable
parts
and
tried
temper
of
the
party
you
praise
but
i
see
well
that
for
all
his
purple
cloaks
i
shall
not
like
him
unless
he
is
at
least
a
poor
greek
like
me
i
can
not
deny
it
o
friend
that
the
vast
shadow
of
the
phenomenal
includes
thee
also
in
its
pied
and
painted
immensity
thee
also
compared
with
whom
all
else
is
shadow
thou
art
not
being
as
truth
is
as
justice
is
thou
art
not
my
soul
but
a
picture
and
effigy
of
that
thou
hast
come
to
me
lately
and
already
thou
art
seizing
thy
hat
and
cloak
it
is
not
that
the
soul
puts
forth
friends
as
the
tree
puts
forth
leaves
and
presently
by
the
germination
of
new
buds
extrudes
the
old
leaf
the
law
of
nature
is
alternation
forevermore
each
electrical
state
superinduces
the
opposite
the
soul
environs
itself
with
friends
that
it
may
enter
into
a
grander
or
solitude
and
it
goes
alone
for
a
season
that
it
may
exalt
its
conversation
or
society
this
method
betrays
itself
along
the
whole
history
of
our
personal
relations
the
instinct
of
affection
revives
the
hope
of
union
with
our
mates
and
the
returning
sense
of
insulation
recalls
us
from
the
chase
thus
every
man
passes
his
life
in
the
search
after
friendship
and
if
he
should
record
his
true
sentiment
he
might
write
a
letter
like
this
to
each
new
candidate
for
his
love
dear
friend
if
i
was
sure
of
thee
sure
of
thy
capacity
sure
to
match
my
mood
with
thine
i
should
never
think
again
of
trifles
in
relation
to
thy
comings
and
goings
i
am
not
very
wise
my
moods
are
quite
attainable
and
i
respect
thy
genius
it
is
to
me
as
yet
unfathomed
yet
dare
i
not
presume
in
thee
a
perfect
intelligence
of
me
and
so
thou
art
to
me
a
delicious
torment
thine
ever
or
never
yet
these
uneasy
pleasures
and
fine
pains
are
for
curiosity
and
not
for
life
they
are
not
to
be
indulged
this
is
to
weave
cobweb
and
not
cloth
our
friendships
hurry
to
short
and
poor
conclusions
because
we
have
made
them
a
texture
of
wine
and
dreams
instead
of
the
tough
fiber
of
the
human
heart
the
laws
of
friendship
are
great
austere
and
eternal
of
one
web
with
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
morals
but
we
have
aimed
at
a
swift
and
petty
benefit
to
suck
a
sudden
sweetness
we
snatch
at
the
slowest
fruit
in
the
whole
garden
of
god
which
many
summers
and
many
winters
must
ripen
we
seek
our
friend
not
sacredly
but
with
an
adulterate
passion
which
would
appropriate
him
to
ourselves
in
vain
we
are
armed
all
over
with
subtle
antagonisms
which
as
soon
as
we
meet
begin
to
play
and
translate
all
poetry
into
stale
prose
almost
all
people
descend
to
meet
all
association
must
be
a
compromise
and
what
is
worst
the
very
flower
and
aroma
of
the
flower
of
each
of
the
beautiful
natures
disappears
as
they
approach
each
other
what
a
perpetual
disappointment
is
actual
society
even
of
the
virtuous
and
gifted
after
interviews
have
been
compassed
with
long
foresight
we
must
be
tormented
presently
by
baffled
blows
by
sudden
unseasonable
apathies
by
epilepsies
of
wit
and
of
animal
spirits
in
the
heyday
of
friendship
and
thought
our
faculties
do
not
play
us
true
and
both
parties
are
relieved
by
solitude
i
ought
to
be
equal
to
every
relation
it
makes
no
difference
how
many
friends
i
have
and
what
content
i
can
find
in
conversing
with
each
if
there
be
one
to
whom
i
am
not
equal
if
i
have
shrunk
unequal
from
one
contest
instantly
the
joy
i
find
in
all
the
rest
becomes
mean
and
cowardly
i
should
hate
myself
if
then
i
made
my
other
friends
my
asylum
the
valiant
warrior
famoused
for
fight
after
a
hundred
victories
once
foiled
is
from
the
book
of
honor
razed
quite
and
all
the
rest
forgot
for
which
he
toiled
our
impatience
is
thus
sharply
rebuked
bashfulness
and
apathy
are
a
tough
husk
in
which
a
delicate
organization
is
protected
from
premature
ripening
it
would
be
lost
if
it
knew
itself
before
any
of
the
best
souls
were
yet
ripe
enough
to
know
and
own
it
respect
the
which
hardens
the
ruby
in
a
million
years
and
works
in
duration
in
which
alps
and
andes
come
and
go
as
rainbows
the
good
spirit
of
our
life
has
no
heaven
which
is
the
price
of
rashness
love
which
is
the
essence
of
god
is
not
for
levity
but
for
the
total
worth
of
man
let
us
not
have
this
childish
luxury
in
our
regards
but
the
austerest
worth
let
us
approach
our
friend
with
an
audacious
trust
in
the
truth
of
his
heart
in
the
breadth
impossible
to
be
overturned
of
his
foundations
the
attractions
of
this
subject
are
not
to
be
resisted
and
i
leave
for
the
time
all
account
of
subordinate
social
benefit
to
speak
of
that
select
and
sacred
relation
which
is
a
kind
of
absolute
and
which
even
leaves
the
language
of
love
suspicious
and
common
so
much
is
this
purer
and
nothing
is
so
much
divine
i
do
not
wish
to
treat
friendships
daintily
but
with
roughest
courage
when
they
are
real
they
are
not
glass
threads
or
but
the
solidest
thing
we
know
for
now
after
so
many
ages
of
experience
what
do
we
know
of
nature
or
of
ourselves
not
one
step
has
man
taken
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
his
destiny
in
one
condemnation
of
folly
stand
the
whole
universe
of
men
but
the
sweet
sincerity
of
joy
and
peace
which
i
draw
from
this
alliance
with
my
brother
soul
is
the
nut
itself
whereof
all
nature
and
all
thought
is
but
the
husk
and
shell
happy
is
the
house
that
shelters
a
friend
it
might
well
be
built
like
a
festal
bower
or
arch
to
entertain
him
a
single
day
happier
if
he
know
the
solemnity
of
that
relation
and
honor
its
law
he
who
offers
himself
a
candidate
for
that
covenant
comes
up
like
an
olympian
to
the
great
games
where
the
of
the
world
are
the
competitors
he
proposes
himself
for
contest
where
time
want
danger
are
in
the
lists
and
he
alone
is
victor
who
has
truth
enough
in
his
constitution
to
preserve
the
delicacy
of
his
beauty
from
the
wear
and
tear
of
all
these
the
gifts
of
fortune
may
be
present
or
absent
but
all
the
hap
in
that
contest
depends
on
intrinsic
nobleness
and
the
contempt
of
trifles
there
are
two
elements
that
go
to
the
composition
of
friendship
each
so
sovereign
that
i
can
detect
no
superiority
in
either
no
reason
why
either
should
be
first
named
one
is
truth
a
friend
is
a
person
with
whom
i
may
be
sincere
before
him
i
may
think
aloud
i
am
arrived
at
last
in
the
presence
of
a
man
so
real
and
equal
that
i
may
drop
even
those
undermost
garments
of
dissimulation
courtesy
and
second
thought
which
men
never
put
off
and
may
deal
with
him
with
the
simplicity
and
wholeness
with
which
one
chemical
atom
meets
another
sincerity
is
the
luxury
allowed
but
diadems
and
authority
only
to
the
highest
rank
being
permitted
to
speak
truth
as
having
none
above
it
to
court
or
conform
unto
every
man
alone
is
sincere
at
the
entrance
of
a
second
person
hypocrisy
begins
we
parry
and
fend
the
approach
of
our
by
compliments
by
gossip
by
amusements
by
affairs
we
cover
up
our
thought
from
him
under
a
hundred
folds
i
knew
a
man
who
under
a
certain
religious
frenzy
cast
off
this
drapery
and
omitting
all
compliments
and
commonplace
spoke
to
the
conscience
of
every
person
he
encountered
and
that
with
great
insight
and
beauty
at
first
he
was
resisted
and
all
men
agreed
he
was
mad
but
persisting
as
indeed
he
could
not
help
doing
for
some
time
in
this
course
he
attained
to
the
advantage
of
bringing
every
man
of
his
acquaintance
into
true
relations
with
him
no
man
would
think
of
speaking
falsely
with
him
or
of
putting
him
off
with
any
chat
of
markets
or
but
every
man
was
constrained
by
so
much
sincerity
to
the
like
plain
dealing
and
what
love
of
nature
what
poetry
what
symbol
of
truth
he
had
he
did
certainly
show
him
but
to
most
of
us
society
shows
not
its
face
and
eye
but
its
side
and
its
back
to
stand
in
true
relations
with
men
in
a
false
age
is
worth
a
fit
of
insanity
is
it
not
we
can
seldom
go
erect
almost
every
man
we
meet
requires
some
civility
requires
to
be
humored
he
has
some
fame
some
talent
some
whim
of
religion
or
philanthropy
in
his
head
that
is
not
to
be
questioned
and
which
spoils
all
conversation
with
him
but
a
friend
is
a
sane
man
who
exercises
not
my
ingenuity
but
me
my
friend
gives
me
entertainment
without
requiring
any
stipulation
on
my
part
a
friend
therefore
is
a
sort
of
paradox
in
nature
i
who
alone
am
i
who
see
nothing
in
nature
whose
existence
i
can
affirm
with
equal
evidence
to
my
own
behold
now
the
semblance
of
my
being
in
all
its
height
variety
and
curiosity
reiterated
in
a
foreign
form
so
that
a
friend
may
well
be
reckoned
the
masterpiece
of
nature
the
other
element
of
friendship
is
tenderness
we
are
holden
to
men
by
every
sort
of
tie
by
blood
by
pride
by
fear
by
hope
by
lucre
by
lust
by
hate
by
admiration
by
every
circumstance
and
badge
and
trifle
but
we
can
scarce
believe
that
so
much
character
can
subsist
in
another
as
to
draw
us
by
love
can
another
be
so
blessed
and
we
so
pure
that
we
can
offer
him
tenderness
when
a
man
becomes
dear
to
me
i
have
touched
the
goal
of
fortune
i
find
very
little
written
directly
to
the
heart
of
this
matter
in
books
and
yet
i
have
one
text
which
i
can
not
choose
but
remember
my
author
says
i
offer
myself
faintly
and
bluntly
to
those
whose
i
effectually
am
and
tender
myself
least
to
him
to
whom
i
am
the
most
devoted
i
wish
that
friendship
should
have
feet
as
well
as
eyes
and
eloquence
it
must
plant
itself
on
the
ground
before
it
vaults
over
the
moon
i
wish
it
to
be
a
little
of
a
citizen
before
it
is
quite
a
cherub
we
chide
the
citizen
because
he
makes
love
a
commodity
it
is
an
exchange
of
gifts
of
useful
loans
it
is
good
neighborhood
it
watches
with
the
sick
it
holds
the
pall
at
the
funeral
and
quite
loses
sight
of
the
delicacies
and
nobility
of
the
relation
but
though
we
can
not
find
the
god
under
this
disguise
of
a
sutler
yet
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
forgive
the
poet
if
he
spins
his
thread
too
fine
and
does
not
substantiate
his
romance
by
the
municipal
virtues
of
justice
punctuality
fidelity
and
pity
i
hate
the
prostitution
of
the
name
of
friendship
to
signify
modish
and
worldly
alliances
i
much
prefer
the
company
of
and
to
the
silken
and
perfumed
amity
which
only
celebrates
its
days
of
encounter
by
a
frivolous
display
by
rides
in
a
curricle
and
dinners
at
the
best
taverns
the
end
of
friendship
is
a
commerce
the
most
strict
and
homely
that
can
be
joined
more
strict
than
any
of
which
we
have
experience
it
is
for
aid
and
comfort
through
all
the
relations
and
passages
of
life
and
death
it
is
fit
for
serene
days
and
graceful
gifts
and
country
rambles
but
also
for
rough
roads
and
hard
fare
shipwreck
poverty
and
persecution
it
keeps
company
with
the
sallies
of
the
wit
and
the
trances
of
religion
we
are
to
dignify
to
each
other
the
daily
needs
and
offices
of
man
life
and
embellish
it
by
courage
wisdom
and
unity
it
should
never
fall
into
something
usual
and
settled
but
should
be
alert
and
inventive
and
add
rhyme
and
reason
to
what
was
drudgery
friendship
may
be
said
to
require
natures
so
rare
and
costly
each
so
and
so
happily
adapted
and
withal
so
circumstanced
for
even
in
that
particular
a
poet
says
love
demands
that
the
parties
be
altogether
paired
that
its
satisfaction
can
very
seldom
be
assured
it
can
not
subsist
in
its
perfection
say
some
of
those
who
are
learned
in
this
warm
lore
of
the
heart
betwixt
more
than
two
i
am
not
quite
so
strict
in
my
terms
perhaps
because
i
have
never
known
so
high
a
fellowship
as
others
i
please
my
imagination
more
with
a
circle
of
godlike
men
and
women
variously
related
to
each
other
and
between
whom
subsists
a
lofty
intelligence
but
i
find
this
law
of
to
peremptory
for
conversation
which
is
the
practice
and
consummation
of
friendship
do
not
mix
waters
too
much
the
best
mix
as
ill
as
good
and
bad
you
shall
have
very
useful
and
cheering
discourse
at
several
times
with
two
several
men
but
let
all
three
of
you
come
together
and
you
shall
not
have
one
new
and
hearty
word
two
may
talk
and
one
may
hear
but
three
can
not
take
part
in
a
conversation
of
the
most
sincere
and
searching
sort
in
good
company
there
is
never
such
discourse
between
two
across
the
table
as
takes
place
when
you
leave
them
alone
in
good
company
the
individuals
at
once
merge
their
egotism
into
a
social
soul
exactly
with
the
several
consciousnesses
there
present
no
partialities
of
friend
to
friend
no
fondnesses
of
brother
to
sister
of
wife
to
husband
are
there
pertinent
but
quite
otherwise
only
he
may
then
speak
who
can
sail
on
the
common
thought
of
the
party
and
not
poorly
limited
to
his
own
now
this
convention
which
good
sense
demands
destroys
the
high
freedom
of
great
conversation
which
requires
an
absolute
running
of
two
souls
into
one
no
two
men
but
being
left
alone
with
each
other
enter
into
simpler
relations
yet
it
is
affinity
that
determines
two
shall
converse
unrelated
men
give
little
joy
to
each
other
will
never
suspect
the
latent
powers
of
each
we
talk
sometimes
of
a
great
talent
for
conversation
as
if
it
were
a
permanent
property
in
some
individuals
conversation
is
an
evanescent
relation
no
more
a
man
is
reputed
to
have
thought
and
eloquence
he
can
not
for
all
that
say
a
word
to
his
cousin
or
his
uncle
they
accuse
his
silence
with
as
much
reason
as
they
would
blame
the
insignificance
of
a
dial
in
the
shade
in
the
sun
it
will
mark
the
hour
among
those
who
enjoy
his
thought
he
will
regain
his
tongue
friendship
requires
that
rare
mean
betwixt
likeness
and
unlikeness
that
piques
each
with
the
presence
of
power
and
of
consent
in
the
other
party
let
me
be
alone
to
the
end
of
the
world
rather
than
that
my
friend
should
overstep
by
a
word
or
a
look
his
real
sympathy
i
am
equally
balked
by
antagonism
and
by
compliance
let
him
not
cease
an
instant
to
be
himself
the
only
joy
i
have
in
his
being
mine
is
that
the
is
i
hate
where
i
looked
for
a
manly
furtherance
or
at
least
a
manly
resistance
to
find
a
mush
of
concession
better
be
a
nettle
in
the
side
of
your
friend
than
his
echo
the
condition
which
high
friendship
demands
is
ability
to
do
without
it
that
high
office
requires
great
and
sublime
parts
there
must
be
very
two
before
there
can
be
very
one
let
it
be
an
alliance
of
two
large
formidable
natures
mutually
beheld
mutually
feared
before
yet
they
recognize
the
deep
identity
which
beneath
these
disparities
unites
them
he
only
is
fit
for
this
society
who
is
magnanimous
who
is
sure
that
greatness
and
goodness
are
always
economy
who
is
not
swift
to
intermeddle
with
his
fortunes
let
him
not
intermeddle
with
this
leave
to
the
diamond
its
ages
to
grow
nor
expect
to
accelerate
the
births
of
the
eternal
friendship
demands
a
religious
treatment
we
talk
of
choosing
our
friends
but
friends
are
reverence
is
a
great
part
of
it
treat
your
friend
as
a
spectacle
of
course
he
has
merits
that
are
not
yours
and
that
you
can
not
honor
if
you
must
needs
hold
him
close
to
your
person
stand
aside
give
those
merits
room
let
them
mount
and
expand
are
you
the
friend
of
your
buttons
or
of
his
thought
to
a
great
heart
he
will
still
be
a
stranger
in
a
thousand
particulars
that
he
may
come
near
in
the
holiest
ground
leave
it
to
girls
and
boys
to
regard
a
friend
as
property
and
to
suck
a
short
and
pleasure
instead
of
the
noblest
benefits
let
us
buy
our
entrance
to
this
guild
by
a
long
probation
why
should
we
desecrate
noble
and
beautiful
souls
by
intruding
on
them
why
insist
on
rash
personal
relations
with
your
friend
why
go
to
his
house
or
know
his
mother
and
brother
and
sisters
why
be
visited
by
him
at
your
own
are
these
things
material
to
our
covenant
leave
this
touching
and
clawing
let
him
be
to
me
a
spirit
a
message
a
thought
a
sincerity
a
glance
from
him
i
want
but
not
news
nor
pottage
i
can
get
politics
and
chat
and
neighborly
conveniences
from
cheaper
companions
should
not
the
society
of
my
friend
be
to
me
poetic
pure
universal
and
great
as
nature
itself
ought
i
to
feel
that
our
tie
is
profane
in
comparison
with
yonder
bar
of
cloud
that
sleeps
on
the
horizon
or
that
clump
of
waving
grass
that
divides
the
brook
let
us
not
vilify
but
raise
it
to
that
standard
that
great
defying
eye
that
scornful
beauty
of
his
mien
and
action
do
not
pique
yourself
on
reducing
but
rather
fortify
and
enhance
worship
his
superiorities
wish
him
not
less
by
a
thought
but
hoard
and
tell
them
all
guard
him
as
thy
counterpart
let
him
be
to
thee
forever
a
sort
of
beautiful
enemy
untamable
devoutly
revered
and
not
a
trivial
conveniency
to
be
soon
outgrown
and
cast
aside
the
hues
of
the
opal
the
light
of
the
diamond
are
not
to
be
seen
if
the
eye
is
too
near
to
my
friend
i
write
a
letter
and
from
him
i
receive
a
letter
that
seems
to
you
a
little
it
suffices
me
it
is
a
spiritual
gift
worthy
of
him
to
give
and
of
me
to
receive
it
profanes
nobody
in
these
warm
lines
the
heart
will
trust
itself
as
it
will
not
to
the
tongue
and
pour
out
the
prophecy
of
a
godlier
existence
than
all
the
annals
of
heroism
have
yet
made
good
respect
so
far
the
holy
laws
of
this
fellowship
as
not
to
prejudice
its
perfect
flower
by
your
impatience
for
its
opening
we
must
be
our
own
before
we
can
be
another
there
is
at
least
this
satisfaction
in
crime
according
to
the
latin
proverb
you
can
speak
to
your
accomplice
on
even
terms
quos
inquinat
to
those
whom
we
admire
and
love
at
first
we
can
not
yet
the
least
defect
of
vitiates
in
my
judgment
the
entire
relation
there
can
never
be
deep
peace
between
two
spirits
never
mutual
respect
until
in
their
dialogue
each
stands
for
the
whole
world
what
is
so
great
as
friendship
let
us
carry
with
what
grandeur
of
spirit
we
can
let
us
be
silent
so
we
may
hear
the
whisper
of
the
gods
let
us
not
interfere
who
set
you
to
cast
about
what
you
should
say
to
the
select
souls
or
how
to
say
anything
to
such
no
matter
how
ingenious
no
matter
how
graceful
and
bland
there
are
innumerable
degrees
of
folly
and
wisdom
and
for
you
to
say
aught
is
to
be
frivolous
wait
and
thy
heart
shall
speak
wait
until
the
necessary
and
everlasting
overpowers
you
until
day
and
night
avail
themselves
of
your
lips
the
only
reward
of
virtue
is
virtue
the
only
way
to
have
a
friend
is
to
be
one
you
shall
not
come
nearer
a
man
by
getting
into
his
house
if
unlike
his
soul
only
flees
the
faster
from
you
and
you
shall
catch
never
a
true
glance
of
his
eye
we
see
the
noble
afar
off
and
they
repel
us
why
should
we
intrude
late
very
late
we
perceive
that
no
arrangements
no
introductions
no
consuetudes
or
habits
of
society
would
be
of
any
avail
to
establish
us
in
such
relations
with
them
as
we
desire
but
solely
the
uprise
of
nature
in
us
to
the
same
degree
it
is
in
them
then
shall
we
meet
as
water
with
water
and
if
we
should
not
meet
them
then
we
shall
not
want
them
for
we
are
already
they
in
the
last
analysis
love
is
only
the
reflection
of
a
man
own
worthiness
from
other
men
men
have
sometimes
exchanged
names
with
their
friends
as
if
they
would
signify
that
in
their
friend
each
loved
his
own
soul
the
higher
the
style
we
demand
of
friendship
of
course
the
less
easy
to
establish
it
with
flesh
and
blood
we
walk
alone
in
the
world
friends
such
as
we
desire
are
dreams
and
fables
but
a
sublime
hope
cheers
ever
the
faithful
heart
that
elsewhere
in
other
regions
of
the
universal
power
souls
are
now
acting
enduring
and
daring
which
can
love
us
and
which
we
can
love
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
that
the
period
of
nonage
of
follies
of
blunders
and
of
shame
is
passed
in
solitude
and
when
we
are
finished
men
we
shall
grasp
heroic
hands
in
heroic
hands
only
be
admonished
by
what
you
already
see
not
to
strike
leagues
of
friendship
with
cheap
persons
where
no
friendship
can
be
our
impatience
betrays
us
into
rash
and
foolish
alliances
which
no
god
attends
by
persisting
in
your
path
though
you
forfeit
the
little
you
gain
the
great
you
demonstrate
yourself
so
as
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
reach
of
false
relations
and
you
draw
to
you
the
of
the
world
those
rare
pilgrims
whereof
only
one
or
two
wander
in
nature
at
once
and
before
whom
the
vulgar
great
show
as
specters
and
shadows
merely
it
is
foolish
to
be
afraid
of
making
our
ties
too
spiritual
as
if
so
we
could
lose
any
genuine
love
whatever
correction
of
our
popular
views
we
make
from
insight
nature
will
be
sure
to
bear
us
out
in
and
though
it
seem
to
rob
us
of
some
joy
will
repay
us
with
a
greater
let
us
feel
if
we
will
the
absolute
insulation
of
man
we
are
sure
that
we
have
all
in
us
we
go
to
europe
or
we
pursue
persons
or
we
read
books
in
the
instinctive
faith
that
these
will
call
it
out
and
reveal
us
to
ourselves
beggars
all
the
persons
are
such
as
we
the
europe
an
old
faded
garment
of
dead
persons
the
books
their
ghosts
let
us
drop
this
idolatry
let
us
give
over
this
mendicancy
let
us
even
bid
our
dearest
friends
farewell
and
defy
them
saying
who
are
you
unhand
me
i
will
be
dependent
no
more
ah
seest
thou
not
o
brother
that
thus
we
part
only
to
meet
again
on
a
higher
platform
and
only
be
more
each
other
because
we
are
more
our
own
a
friend
is
he
looks
to
the
past
and
the
future
he
is
the
child
of
all
my
foregoing
hours
the
prophet
of
those
to
come
and
the
harbinger
of
a
greater
friend
i
do
then
with
my
friends
as
i
do
with
my
books
i
would
have
them
where
i
can
find
them
but
i
seldom
use
them
we
must
have
society
on
our
own
terms
and
admit
or
exclude
it
on
the
slightest
cause
i
can
not
afford
to
speak
much
with
my
friend
if
he
is
great
he
makes
me
so
great
that
i
can
not
descend
to
converse
in
the
great
days
presentiments
hover
before
me
far
before
me
in
the
firmament
i
ought
then
to
dedicate
myself
to
them
i
go
in
that
i
may
seize
them
i
go
out
that
i
may
seize
them
i
fear
only
that
i
may
lose
them
receding
into
the
sky
in
which
now
they
are
only
a
patch
of
brighter
light
then
though
i
prize
my
friends
i
can
not
afford
to
talk
with
them
and
study
their
visions
lest
i
lose
my
own
it
would
indeed
give
me
a
certain
household
joy
to
quit
this
lofty
seeking
this
spiritual
astronomy
or
search
of
stars
and
come
down
to
warm
sympathies
with
you
but
then
i
know
well
i
shall
mourn
always
the
vanishing
of
my
mighty
gods
it
is
true
next
week
i
shall
have
languid
moods
when
i
can
well
afford
to
occupy
myself
with
foreign
objects
then
i
shall
regret
the
lost
literature
of
your
mind
and
wish
you
were
by
my
side
again
but
if
you
come
perhaps
you
will
fill
my
mind
only
with
new
visions
not
with
yourself
but
with
your
lusters
and
i
shall
not
be
able
any
more
than
now
to
converse
with
you
so
i
will
owe
to
my
friends
this
evanescent
intercourse
i
will
receive
from
them
not
what
they
have
but
what
they
are
they
shall
give
me
that
which
properly
they
can
not
give
but
which
emanates
from
them
but
they
shall
not
hold
me
by
any
relations
less
subtile
and
pure
we
will
meet
as
though
we
met
not
and
part
as
though
we
parted
not
it
has
seemed
to
me
lately
more
possible
than
i
knew
to
carry
a
friendship
greatly
on
one
side
without
due
correspondence
on
the
other
why
should
i
cumber
myself
with
regrets
that
the
receiver
is
not
capacious
it
never
troubles
the
sun
that
some
of
his
rays
fall
wide
and
vain
into
ungrateful
space
and
only
a
small
part
on
the
reflecting
planet
let
your
greatness
educate
the
crude
and
cold
companion
if
he
is
unequal
he
will
presently
pass
away
but
thou
art
enlarged
by
thy
own
shining
and
no
longer
a
mate
for
frogs
and
worms
dost
soar
and
burn
with
the
gods
of
the
empyrean
it
is
thought
a
disgrace
to
love
unrequited
but
the
great
will
see
that
true
love
can
not
be
unrequited
true
love
transcends
the
unworthy
object
and
dwells
and
broods
on
the
eternal
and
when
the
poor
interposed
mask
crumbles
it
is
not
sad
but
feels
rid
of
so
much
earth
and
feels
its
independency
the
surer
yet
these
things
may
hardly
be
said
without
a
sort
of
treachery
to
the
relation
the
essence
of
friendship
is
entireness
a
total
magnanimity
and
trust
it
must
not
surmise
or
provide
for
infirmity
it
treats
its
object
as
a
god
that
it
may
deify
both
heroism
paradise
is
under
the
shadow
of
swords
in
the
elder
english
dramatists
and
mainly
in
the
plays
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
there
is
a
constant
recognition
of
gentility
as
if
a
noble
behavior
were
as
easily
marked
in
the
society
of
their
age
as
color
is
in
our
american
population
when
any
rodrigo
pedro
or
valerio
enters
though
he
be
a
stranger
the
duke
or
governor
exclaims
this
is
a
gentleman
and
proffers
civilities
without
end
but
all
the
rest
are
slag
and
refuse
in
harmony
with
this
delight
in
personal
advantages
there
is
in
their
plays
a
certain
heroic
cast
of
character
and
dialogue
as
in
bonduca
sophocles
the
mad
lover
the
double
marriage
wherein
the
speaker
is
so
earnest
and
cordial
and
on
such
deep
grounds
of
character
that
the
dialogue
on
the
slightest
additional
incident
in
the
plot
rises
naturally
into
poetry
among
many
texts
take
the
following
the
roman
martius
has
conquered
athens
all
but
the
invincible
spirits
of
sophocles
the
duke
of
athens
and
dorigen
his
wife
the
beauty
of
the
latter
inflames
martius
and
he
seeks
to
save
her
husband
but
sophocles
will
not
ask
his
life
although
assured
that
a
word
will
save
him
and
the
execution
of
both
proceeds
bid
thy
wife
farewell
no
i
will
take
no
leave
my
dorigen
yonder
above
ariadne
crown
my
spirit
shall
hover
for
thee
prithee
haste
stay
sophocles
with
this
tie
up
my
sight
let
not
soft
nature
so
transformed
be
and
lose
her
gentler
sexed
humanity
to
make
me
see
my
lord
bleed
so
is
well
never
one
object
underneath
the
sun
will
i
behold
before
my
sophocles
farewell
now
teach
the
romans
how
to
die
dost
know
what
is
to
die
thou
dost
not
martius
and
therefore
not
what
is
to
live
to
die
is
to
begin
to
live
it
is
to
end
an
old
stale
weary
work
and
to
commence
a
newer
and
a
better
is
to
leave
deceitful
knaves
for
the
society
of
gods
and
goodness
thou
thyself
must
part
at
last
from
all
thy
garlands
pleasures
triumphs
and
prove
thy
fortitude
what
then
do
but
art
not
grieved
nor
vexed
to
leave
thy
life
thus
why
should
i
grieve
or
vex
for
being
sent
to
them
i
ever
loved
best
now
i
kneel
but
with
my
back
toward
thee
is
the
last
duty
this
trunk
can
do
the
gods
strike
strike
valerius
or
martius
heart
will
leap
out
at
his
mouth
this
is
a
man
a
woman
kiss
thy
lord
and
live
with
all
the
freedom
you
were
wont
o
love
thou
doubly
hast
afflicted
me
with
virtue
and
with
beauty
treacherous
heart
my
hand
shall
cast
thee
quick
into
my
urn
ere
thou
transgress
this
knot
of
piety
what
ails
my
brother
martius
oh
martius
thou
now
hast
found
a
way
to
conquer
me
o
star
of
rome
what
gratitude
can
speak
fit
words
to
follow
such
a
deed
as
this
this
admirable
duke
valerius
with
his
disdain
of
fortune
and
of
death
captived
himself
has
captived
me
and
though
my
arm
hath
his
body
here
his
soul
hath
subjugated
martius
soul
by
romulus
he
is
all
soul
i
think
he
hath
no
flesh
and
spirit
can
not
be
gyved
then
we
have
vanquished
nothing
he
is
free
and
martius
walks
now
in
captivity
i
do
not
readily
remember
any
poem
play
sermon
novel
or
oration
that
our
press
vents
in
the
last
few
years
which
goes
to
the
same
tune
we
have
a
great
many
flutes
and
flageolets
but
not
often
the
sound
of
any
fife
yet
wordsworth
laodamia
and
the
ode
of
dion
and
some
sonnets
have
a
certain
noble
music
and
scott
will
sometimes
draw
a
stroke
like
the
portrait
of
lord
evandale
given
by
balfour
of
burley
thomas
carlyle
with
his
natural
taste
for
what
is
manly
and
daring
in
character
has
suffered
no
heroic
trait
in
his
favorites
to
drop
from
his
biographical
and
historical
pictures
earlier
robert
burns
has
given
us
a
song
or
two
in
the
harleian
miscellanies
there
is
an
account
of
the
battle
of
lutzen
which
deserves
to
be
read
and
simon
ockley
history
of
the
saracens
recounts
the
prodigies
of
individual
valor
with
admiration
all
the
more
evident
on
the
part
of
the
narrator
that
he
seems
to
think
that
his
place
in
christian
oxford
requires
of
him
some
proper
protestations
of
abhorrence
but
if
we
explore
the
literature
of
heroism
we
shall
quickly
come
to
plutarch
who
is
its
doctor
and
historian
to
him
we
owe
the
brasidas
the
dion
the
epaminondas
the
scipio
of
old
and
i
must
think
we
are
more
deeply
indebted
to
him
than
to
all
the
ancient
writers
each
of
his
lives
is
a
refutation
to
the
despondency
and
cowardice
of
our
religious
and
political
theorists
a
wild
courage
a
stoicism
not
of
the
schools
but
of
the
blood
shines
in
every
anecdote
and
has
given
that
book
its
immense
fame
we
need
books
of
this
tart
cathartic
virtue
more
than
books
of
political
science
or
of
private
economy
life
is
a
festival
only
to
the
wise
seen
from
the
nook
and
of
prudence
it
wears
a
ragged
and
dangerous
front
the
violations
of
the
laws
of
nature
by
our
predecessors
and
our
contemporaries
are
punished
in
us
also
the
disease
and
deformity
around
us
certify
the
infraction
of
natural
intellectual
and
moral
laws
and
often
violation
on
violation
to
breed
such
compound
misery
a
lockjaw
that
bends
a
man
head
back
to
his
heels
hydrophobia
that
makes
him
bark
at
his
wife
and
babes
insanity
that
makes
him
eat
grass
war
plague
cholera
famine
indicate
a
certain
ferocity
in
nature
which
as
it
had
its
inlet
by
human
crime
must
have
its
outlet
by
human
suffering
unhappily
almost
no
man
exists
who
has
not
in
his
own
person
become
to
some
amount
a
stockholder
in
the
sin
and
so
made
himself
liable
to
a
share
in
the
expiation
our
culture
therefore
must
not
omit
the
arming
of
the
man
let
him
hear
in
season
that
he
is
born
into
the
state
of
war
and
that
the
commonwealth
and
his
own
require
that
he
should
not
go
dancing
in
the
weeds
of
peace
but
warned
and
neither
defying
nor
dreading
the
thunder
let
him
take
both
reputation
and
life
in
his
hand
and
with
perfect
urbanity
dare
the
gibbet
and
the
mob
by
the
absolute
truth
of
his
speech
and
the
rectitude
of
his
behavior
toward
all
this
external
evil
the
man
within
the
breast
assumes
a
warlike
attitude
and
affirms
his
ability
to
cope
with
the
infinite
army
of
enemies
to
this
military
attitude
of
the
soul
we
give
the
name
of
heroism
its
rudest
form
is
the
contempt
for
safety
and
ease
which
makes
the
attractiveness
of
war
it
is
a
which
slights
the
restraints
of
prudence
in
the
plenitude
of
its
energy
and
power
to
repair
the
harms
it
may
suffer
the
hero
is
a
mind
of
such
balance
that
no
disturbances
can
shake
his
will
but
pleasantly
and
as
it
were
merrily
he
advances
to
his
own
music
alike
in
frightful
alarms
and
in
the
tipsy
mirth
of
universal
dissoluteness
there
is
somewhat
not
philosophical
in
heroism
there
is
somewhat
not
holy
in
it
it
seems
not
to
know
that
other
souls
are
of
one
texture
with
it
it
has
pride
it
is
the
extreme
of
individual
nature
nevertheless
we
must
profoundly
revere
it
there
is
somewhat
in
great
actions
which
does
not
allow
us
to
go
behind
them
heroism
feels
and
never
reasons
and
therefore
is
always
right
and
although
a
different
breeding
different
religion
and
greater
intellectual
activity
would
have
modified
or
even
reversed
the
particular
action
yet
for
the
hero
that
thing
he
does
is
the
highest
deed
and
is
not
open
to
the
censure
of
philosophers
or
divines
it
is
the
avowal
of
the
unschooled
man
that
he
finds
a
quality
in
him
that
is
negligent
of
expense
of
health
of
life
of
danger
of
hatred
of
reproach
and
knows
that
his
will
is
higher
and
more
excellent
than
all
actual
and
all
possible
antagonists
heroism
works
in
contradiction
to
the
voice
of
mankind
and
in
contradiction
for
a
time
to
the
voice
of
the
great
and
good
heroism
is
an
obedience
to
a
secret
impulse
of
an
individual
character
now
to
no
other
man
can
its
wisdom
appear
as
it
does
to
him
for
every
man
must
be
supposed
to
see
a
little
further
on
his
own
proper
path
than
any
one
else
therefore
just
and
wise
men
take
umbrage
at
his
act
until
after
some
little
time
be
past
then
they
see
it
to
be
in
unison
with
their
acts
all
prudent
men
see
that
the
action
is
clean
contrary
to
a
sensual
prosperity
for
every
heroic
act
measures
itself
by
its
contempt
of
some
external
good
but
it
finds
its
own
success
at
last
and
then
the
prudent
also
extol
is
the
essence
of
heroism
it
is
the
state
of
the
soul
at
war
and
its
ultimate
objects
are
the
last
defiance
of
falsehood
and
wrong
and
the
power
to
bear
all
that
can
be
inflicted
by
evil
agents
it
speaks
the
truth
and
it
is
just
generous
hospitable
temperate
scornful
of
petty
calculations
and
scornful
of
being
scorned
it
persists
it
is
of
an
undaunted
boldness
and
of
a
fortitude
not
to
be
wearied
out
its
jest
is
the
littleness
of
common
life
that
false
prudence
which
dotes
on
health
and
wealth
is
the
butt
and
merriment
of
heroism
heroism
like
plotinus
is
almost
ashamed
of
its
body
what
shall
it
say
then
to
the
and
to
the
toilet
compliments
quarrels
cards
and
custard
which
rack
the
wit
of
all
human
society
what
joys
has
kind
nature
provided
for
us
dear
creatures
there
seems
to
be
no
interval
between
greatness
and
meanness
when
the
spirit
is
not
master
of
the
world
then
it
is
its
dupe
yet
the
little
man
takes
the
great
hoax
so
innocently
works
in
it
so
headlong
and
believing
is
born
red
and
dies
gray
arranging
his
toilet

on
his
own
health
laying
traps
for
sweet
food
and
strong
wine
setting
his
heart
on
a
horse
or
a
rifle
made
happy
with
a
little
gossip
or
a
little
praise
that
the
great
soul
can
not
choose
but
laugh
at
such
earnest
nonsense
indeed
these
humble
considerations
make
me
out
of
love
with
greatness
what
a
disgrace
is
it
to
me
to
take
note
how
many
pairs
of
silk
stockings
thou
hast
namely
these
and
those
that
were
the
ones
or
to
bear
the
inventory
of
thy
shirts
as
one
for
superfluity
and
one
other
for
use
citizens
thinking
after
the
laws
of
arithmetic
consider
the
inconvenience
of
receiving
strangers
at
their
fireside
reckon
narrowly
the
loss
of
time
and
the
unusual
display
the
soul
of
a
better
quality
thrusts
back
the
unreasonable
economy
into
the
vaults
of

i
will
obey

provide
ibn
hankal
the
arabian
geographer
describes
a
heroic
extreme
in
the
hospitality
of
sogd
in
bokhar
when
i
was
in
sogd
i
saw
a
great
building
like
a
palace
the
gates
of
which
were
open
and
fixed
back
to
the
wall
with
large
nails
i
asked
the
reason
and
was
told
that
the
house
had
not
been
shut
night
or
day
for
a
hundred
years
strangers
may
present
themselves
at
any
hour
and
in
whatever
number
the
master
has
amply
provided
for
the
reception
of
the
men
and
their
animals
and
is
never
happier
than
when
they
tarry
for
some
time
nothing
of
the
kind
have
i
seen
in
any
other
country
the
magnanimous
know
very
well
that
they
who
give
time
or
money
or
shelter
to
the
stranger
so
it
be
done
for
love
and
not
for
ostentation
do
as
it
were
put
god
under
obligation
to
them
so
perfect
are
the
compensations
of
the
universe
in
some
way
the
time
they
seem
to
lose
is
redeemed
and
the
pains
they
seem
to
take
remunerate
themselves
these
men
fan
the
flame
of
human
love
and
raise
the
standard
of
civil
virtue
among
mankind
but
hospitality
must
be
for
service
and
not
for
show
or
it
pulls
down
the
host
the
brave
soul
rates
itself
too
high
to
value
itself
by
the
splendor
of
its
table
and
draperies
it
gives
what
it
hath
and
all
it
hath
but
its
own
majesty
can
lend
a
better
grace
to
bannocks
and
fair
water
than
belong
to
city
feasts
the
temperance
of
the
hero
proceeds
from
the
same
wish
to
do
no
dishonor
to
the
worthiness
he
has
but
he
loves
it
for
its
elegancy
not
for
its
austerity
it
seems
not
worth
his
while
to
be
solemn
and
denounce
with
bitterness
or
the
use
of
tobacco
or
opium
or
tea
or
silk
or
gold
a
great
man
scarcely
knows
how
he
dines
how
he
dresses
but
without
railing
or
precision
his
living
is
natural
and
poetic
john
eliot
the
indian
apostle
drank
water
and
said
of
wine
it
is
a
noble
generous
liquor
and
we
should
be
humbly
thankful
for
it
but
as
i
remember
water
was
made
before
it
better
still
is
the
temperance
of
king
david
who
poured
out
on
the
ground
unto
the
lord
the
water
which
three
of
his
warriors
had
brought
him
to
drink
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
it
is
told
of
brutus
that
when
he
fell
on
his
sword
after
the
battle
of
philippi
he
quoted
a
line
of
euripides
o
virtue
i
have
followed
thee
through
life
and
i
find
thee
at
last
but
a
shade
i
doubt
not
the
hero
is
slandered
by
this
report
the
heroic
soul
does
not
sell
its
justice
and
its
nobleness
it
does
not
ask
to
dine
nicely
and
to
sleep
warm
the
essence
of
greatness
is
the
perception
that
virtue
is
enough
poverty
is
its
ornament
it
does
not
need
plenty
and
can
very
well
abide
its
loss
but
that
which
takes
my
fancy
most
in
the
heroic
class
is
the
good
humor
and
hilarity
they
exhibit
it
is
a
height
to
which
common
duty
can
very
well
attain
to
suffer
and
to
dare
with
solemnity
but
these
rare
souls
set
opinion
success
and
life
at
so
cheap
a
rate
that
they
will
not
soothe
their
enemies
by
petitions
or
the
show
of
sorrow
but
wear
their
own
habitual
greatness
scipio
charged
with
peculation
refuses
to
do
himself
so
great
a
disgrace
as
to
wait
for
justification
though
he
had
the
scroll
of
his
accounts
in
his
hands
but
tears
it
to
pieces
before
the
tribunes
socrates
condemnation
of
himself
to
be
maintained
in
all
honor
in
the
prytaneum
during
his
life
and
sir
thomas
more
playfulness
at
the
scaffold
are
of
the
same
strain
in
beaumont
and
fletcher
sea
voyage
juletta
tells
the
stout
captain
and
his
company
why
slaves
is
in
our
power
to
hang
ye
very
likely
in
our
powers
then
to
be
hanged
and
scorn
ye
these
replies
are
sound
and
whole
sport
is
the
bloom
and
glow
of
a
perfect
health
the
great
will
not
condescend
to
take
anything
seriously
all
must
be
as
gay
as
the
song
of
a
canary
though
it
were
the
building
of
cities
or
the
eradication
of
old
and
foolish
churches
and
nations
which
have
cumbered
the
earth
long
thousands
of
years
simple
hearts
put
all
the
history
and
customs
of
this
world
behind
them
and
play
their
own
play
in
innocent
defiance
of
the
of
the
world
and
such
would
appear
could
we
see
the
human
race
assembled
in
vision
like
little
children
frolicking
together
though
to
the
eyes
of
mankind
at
large
they
wear
a
stately
and
solemn
garb
of
works
and
influences
the
interest
these
fine
stories
have
for
us
the
power
of
a
romance
over
the
boy
who
grasps
the
forbidden
book
under
his
bench
at
school
our
delight
in
the
hero
is
the
main
fact
to
our
purpose
all
these
great
and
transcendent
properties
are
ours
if
we
dilate
in
beholding
the
greek
energy
the
roman
pride
it
is
that
we
are
already
domesticating
the
same
sentiment
let
us
find
room
for
this
great
guest
in
our
small
houses
the
first
step
of
worthiness
will
be
to
disabuse
us
of
our
superstitious
associations
with
places
and
times
with
number
and
size
why
should
these
words
athenian
roman
asia
and
england
so
tingle
in
the
ear
where
the
heart
is
there
the
muses
there
the
gods
sojourn
and
not
in
any
geography
of
fame
massachusetts
connecticut
river
and
boston
bay
you
think
paltry
places
and
the
ear
loves
names
of
foreign
and
classic
topography
but
here
we
are
and
if
we
will
tarry
a
little
we
may
come
to
learn
that
here
is
best
see
to
it
only
that
thyself
is
here
and
art
and
nature
hope
and
fate
friends
angels
and
the
supreme
being
shall
not
be
absent
from
the
chamber
where
thou
sittest
epaminondas
brave
and
affectionate
does
not
seem
to
us
to
need
olympus
to
die
upon
nor
the
syrian
sunshine
he
lies
very
well
where
he
is
the
jerseys
were
handsome
ground
enough
for
washington
to
tread
and
london
streets
for
the

of

a
great
man
makes
his
climate
genial
in
the
imagination
of
men
and
its
air
the
beloved
element
of
all
delicate
spirits
that
country
is
the
fairest
which
is
inhabited
by
the
noblest
minds
the
pictures
which
fill
the
imagination
in
reading
the
actions
of
pericles
xenophon
columbus
bayard
sidney
hampden
teach
us
how
needlessly
mean
our
life
is
that
we
by
the
depth
of
our
living
should
deck
it
with
more
than
regal
or
national
splendor
and
act
on
principles
that
should
interest
man
and
nature
in
the
length
of
our
days
we
have
seen
or
heard
of
many
extraordinary
young
men
who
never
ripened
or
whose
performance
in
actual
life
was
not
extraordinary
when
we
see
their
air
and
mien
when
we
hear
them
speak
of
society
or
books
or
religion
we
admire
their
superiority
they
seem
to
throw
contempt
on
our
entire
polity
and
social
state
theirs
is
the
tone
of
a
youthful
giant
who
is
sent
to
work
revolutions
but
they
enter
an
active
profession
and
the
forming
colossus
shrinks
to
the
common
size
of
man
the
magic
they
used
was
the
ideal
tendencies
which
always
make
the
actual
ridiculous
but
the
tough
world
had
its
revenge
the
moment
they
put
their
horses
of
the
sun
to
plow
in
its
furrow
they
found
no
example
and
no
companion
and
their
heart
fainted
what
then
the
lesson
they
gave
in
their
first
aspirations
is
yet
true
and
a
better
valor
and
a
purer
truth
shall
one
day
organize
their
belief
or
why
should
a
woman
liken
herself
to
any
historical
woman
and
think
because
sappho
or
sévigné
or
de
staël
or
the
cloistered
souls
who
have
had
genius
and
cultivation
do
not
satisfy
the
imagination
and
the
serene
themis
none
can
certainly
not
she
why
not
she
has
a
new
and
unattempted
problem
to
solve
perchance
that
of
the
happiest
nature
that
ever
bloomed
let
the
maiden
with
erect
soul
walk
serenely
on
her
way
accept
the
hint
of
each
new
experience
search
in
turn
all
the
objects
that
solicit
her
eye
that
she
may
learn
the
power
and
the
charm
of
her
being
which
is
the
kindling
of
a
new
dawn
in
the
recesses
of
space
the
fair
girl
who
repels
interference
by
a
decided
and
proud
choice
of
influences
so
careless
of
pleasing
so
wilful
and
lofty
inspires
every
beholder
with
somewhat
of
her
own
nobleness
the
silent
heart
encourages
her
o
friend
never
strike
sail
to
a
fear
come
into
port
greatly
or
sail
with
god
the
seas
not
in
vain
you
live
for
every
passing
eye
is
cheered
and
refined
by
the
vision
the
characteristic
of
a
genuine
heroism
is
its
persistency
all
men
have
wandering
impulses
fits
and
starts
of
generosity
but
when
you
have
chosen
your
part
abide
by
it
and
do
not
weakly
try
to
reconcile
yourself
with
the
world
the
heroic
can
not
be
the
common
nor
the
common
the
heroic
yet
we
have
the
weakness
to
expect
the
sympathy
of
people
in
those
actions
whose
excellence
is
that
they
outrun
sympathy
and
appeal
to
a
tardy
justice
if
you
would
serve
your
brother
because
it
is
fit
for
you
to
serve
him
do
not
take
back
your
words
when
you
find
that
prudent
people
do
not
commend
you
adhere
to
your
own
act
and
congratulate
yourself
if
you
have
done
something
strange
and
extravagant
and
broken
the
monotony
of
a
decorous
age
it
was
a
high
counsel
that
i
once
heard
given
to
a
young
person
always
do
what
you
are
afraid
to
do
a
simple
manly
character
need
never
make
an
apology
but
should
regard
its
past
action
with
the
calmness
of
phocion
when
he
admitted
that
the
event
of
the
battle
was
happy
yet
did
not
regret
his
dissuasion
from
the
battle
there
is
no
weakness
or
exposure
for
which
we
can
not
find
consolation
in
the
thought
this
is
a
part
of
my
constitution
part
of
my
relation
and
office
to
my
has
nature
covenanted
with
me
that
i
should
never
appear
to
disadvantage
never
make
a
ridiculous
figure
let
us
be
generous
of
our
dignity
as
well
as
of
our
money
greatness
once
and
forever
has
done
with
opinion
we
tell
our
charities
not
because
we
wish
to
be
praised
for
them
not
because
we
think
they
have
great
merit
but
for
our
justification
it
is
a
capital
blunder
as
you
discover
when
another
man
recites
his
charities
to
speak
the
truth
even
with
some
austerity
to
live
with
some
rigor
of
temperance
or
some
extremes
of
generosity
seems
to
be
an
asceticism
which
common
would
appoint
to
those
who
are
at
ease
and
in
plenty
in
sign
that
they
feel
a
brotherhood
with
the
great
multitude
of
suffering
men
and
not
only
need
we
breathe
and
exercise
the
soul
by
assuming
the
penalties
of
abstinence
of
debt
of
solitude
of
unpopularity
but
it
behooves
the
wise
man
to
look
with
a
bold
eye
into
those
rarer
dangers
which
sometimes
invade
men
and
to
familiarize
himself
with
disgusting
forms
of
disease
with
sounds
of
execration
and
the
vision
of
violent
death
times
of
heroism
are
generally
times
of
terror
but
the
day
never
shines
in
which
this
element
may
not
work
the
circumstances
of
man
we
say
are
historically
somewhat
better
in
this
country
and
at
this
hour
than
perhaps
ever
before
more
freedom
exists
for
culture
it
will
not
now
run
against
an
ax
at
the
first
step
out
of
the
beaten
track
of
opinion
but
whoso
is
heroic
will
always
find
crises
to
try
his
edge
human
virtue
demands
her
champions
and
martyrs
and
the
trial
of
persecution
always
proceeds
it
is
but
the
other
day
that
the
brave
lovejoy
gave
his
breast
to
the
bullets
of
a
mob
for
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
opinion
and
died
when
it
was
better
not
to
live
i
see
not
any
road
to
perfect
peace
which
a
man
can
walk
but
to
take
counsel
of
his
own
bosom
let
him
quit
too
much
association
let
him
go
home
much
and
establish
himself
in
those
courses
he
approves
the
unremitting
retention
of
simple
and
high
sentiments
in
obscure
duties
is
hardening
the
character
to
that
temper
which
will
work
with
honor
if
need
be
in
the
tumult
or
on
the
scaffold
whatever
outrages
have
happened
to
men
may
befall
a
man
again
and
very
easily
in
a
republic
if
there
appear
any
signs
of
a
decay
of
religion
coarse
slander
fire
tar
and
feathers
and
the
gibbet
the
youth
may
freely
bring
home
to
his
mind
and
with
what
sweetness
of
temper
he
can
and
inquire
how
fast
he
can
fix
his
sense
of
duty
braving
such
penalties
whenever
it
may
please
the
next
newspaper
and
a
sufficient
number
of
his
neighbors
to
pronounce
his
opinions
incendiary
it
may
calm
the
apprehension
of
calamity
in
the
most
susceptible
heart
to
see
how
quick
a
bound
nature
has
set
to
the
utmost
infliction
of
malice
we
rapidly
approach
a
brink
over
which
no
enemy
can
follow
us
let
them
rave
thou
art
quiet
in
thy
grave
in
the
gloom
of
our
ignorance
of
what
shall
be
in
the
hour
when
we
are
deaf
to
the
higher
voices
who
does
not
envy
them
who
have
seen
safely
to
an
end
their
manful
endeavor
who
that
sees
the
meanness
of
our
politics
but
inly
congratulates
washington
that
he
is
long
already
wrapped
in
his
shroud
and
forever
safe
that
he
was
laid
sweet
in
his
grave
the
hope
of
humanity
not
yet
subjugated
in
him
who
does
not
sometimes
envy
the
good
and
brave
who
are
no
more
to
suffer
from
the
tumults
of
the
natural
world
and
await
with
curious
complacency
the
speedy
term
of
his
own
conversation
with
finite
nature
and
yet
the
love
that
will
be
annihilated
sooner
than
treacherous
has
already
made
death
impossible
and
affirms
itself
no
mortal
but
a
native
of
the
deeps
of
absolute
and
inextinguishable
being
manners
half
the
world
it
is
said
knows
not
how
the
other
half
live
our
exploring
expedition
saw
the
feejee
islanders
getting
their
dinner
off
human
bones
and
they
are
said
to
eat
their
own
wives
and
children
the
husbandry
of
the
modern
inhabitants
of
gournou
west
of
old
thebes
is
philosophical
to
a
fault
to
set
up
their
housekeeping
nothing
is
requisite
but
two
or
three
earthen
pots
a
stone
to
grind
meal
and
a
mat
which
is
the
bed
the
house
namely
a
tomb
is
ready
without
rent
or
taxes
no
rain
can
pass
through
the
roof
and
there
is
no
door
for
there
is
no
want
of
one
as
there
is
nothing
to
lose
if
the
house
do
not
please
them
they
walk
out
and
enter
another
as
there
are
several
hundreds
at
their
command
it
is
somewhat
singular
adds
berzoni
to
whom
we
owe
this
account
to
talk
of
happiness
among
people
who
live
in
sepulchers
among
corpses
and
rags
of
an
ancient
nation
which
they
knew
nothing
of
in
the
deserts
of
borgoo
the
still
dwell
in
caves
like
and
the
language
of
these
negroes
is
compared
by
their
neighbors
to
the
shrieking
of
bats
and
to
the
whistling
of
birds
again
the
bornoos
have
no
proper
names
individuals
are
called
after
their
height
thickness
or
other
accidental
quality
and
have
merely
but
the
salt
the
dates
the
ivory
and
the
gold
for
which
these
horrible
regions
are
visited
find
their
way
into
countries
where
the
purchaser
and
consumer
can
hardly
be
ranked
in
one
race
with
these
cannibals
and
countries
where
man
serves
himself
with
metals
wood
stone
glass
gum
cotton
silk
and
wool
honors
himself
with
architecture
writes
laws
and
contrives
to
execute
his
will
through
the
hands
of
many
nations
and
especially
establishes
a
select
society
running
through
all
the
countries
of
intelligent
men
a
aristocracy
or
fraternity
of
the
best
which
without
written
law
or
exact
usage
of
any
kind
perpetuates
itself
colonizes
every
island
and
adopts
and
makes
its
own
whatever
personal
beauty
or
extraordinary
native
endowment
anywhere
appears
what
fact
more
conspicuous
in
modern
history
than
the
creation
of
the
gentleman
chivalry
is
that
and
loyalty
is
that
and
in
english
literature
half
the
drama
and
all
the
novels
from
sir
philip
sidney
to
sir
walter
scott
paint
this
figure
the
word
which
like
the
word
christian
must
hereafter
characterize
the
present
and
the
few
preceding
centuries
by
the
importance
attached
to
it
is
a
homage
to
personal
and
incommunicable
properties
frivolous
and
fantastic
additions
have
got
associated
with
the
name
but
the
steady
interest
of
mankind
in
it
must
be
attributed
to
the
valuable
properties
which
it
designates
an
element
which
unites
all
the
most
forcible
persons
of
every
country
makes
them
intelligible
and
agreeable
to
each
other
and
is
somewhat
so
precise
that
it
is
at
once
felt
if
an
individual
lack
the
masonic
sign
can
not
be
any
casual
product
but
must
be
an
average
result
of
the
character
and
faculties
universally
found
in
men
it
seems
a
certain
permanent
average
as
the
atmosphere
is
a
permanent
composition
whilst
so
many
gases
are
combined
only
to
be
decompounded
il
is
the
frenchman
description
of
good
society
we
must
it
is
a
spontaneous
fruit
of
talents
and
feelings
of
precisely
that
class
who
have
most
vigor
who
take
the
lead
in
the
world
of
this
hour
and
though
far
from
pure
far
from
constituting
the
gladdest
and
highest
tone
of
human
feeling
is
as
good
as
the
whole
society
permits
it
to
be
it
is
made
of
the
spirit
more
than
of
the
talent
of
men
and
is
a
compound
result
into
which
every
great
force
enters
as
an
ingredient
namely
virtue
wit
beauty
wealth
and
power
there
is
something
equivocal
in
all
the
words
in
use
to
express
the
excellence
of
manners
and
social
cultivation
because
the
qualities
are
fluxional
and
the
last
effect
is
assumed
by
the
senses
as
the
cause
the
word
has
not
any
correlative
abstract
to
express
the
quality
is
mean
and
is
obsolete
but
we
must
keep
alive
in
the
vernacular
the
distinction
between
a
word
of
narrow
and
often
sinister
meaning
and
the
heroic
character
which
the
gentleman
imports
the
usual
words
however
must
be
respected
they
will
be
found
to
contain
the
root
of
the
matter
the
point
of
distinction
in
all
this
class
of
names
as
courtesy
chivalry
fashion
and
the
like
is
that
the
flower
and
fruit
not
the
grain
of
the
tree
are
contemplated
it
is
beauty
which
is
the
aim
this
time
and
not
worth
the
result
is
now
in
question
although
our
words
intimate
well
enough
the
popular
feeling
that
the
appearance
supposes
a
substance
the
gentleman
is
a
man
of
truth
lord
of
his
own
actions
and
expressing
that
lordship
in
his
behavior
not
in
any
manner
dependent
and
servile
either
on
persons
or
opinions
or
possessions
beyond
this
fact
of
truth
and
real
force
the
word
denotes
and
benevolence
manhood
first
and
then
gentleness
the
popular
notion
certainly
adds
a
condition
of
ease
and
fortune
but
that
is
a
natural
result
of
personal
force
and
love
that
they
should
possess
and
dispense
the
goods
of
the
world
in
times
of
violence
every
eminent
person
must
fall
in
with
many
opportunities
to
approve
his
stoutness
and
worth
therefore
every
man
name
that
emerged
at
all
from
the
mass
in
the
feudal
ages
rattles
in
our
ear
like
a
flourish
of
trumpets
but
personal
force
never
goes
out
of
fashion
that
is
still
paramount
and
in
the
moving
crowd
of
good
society
the
men
of
valor
and
reality
are
known
and
rise
to
their
natural
place
the
competition
is
transferred
from
war
to
politics
and
trade
but
the
personal
force
appears
readily
enough
in
these
new
arenas
power
first
or
no
leading
class
in
politics
and
in
trade
bruisers
and
pirates
are
of
better
promise
than
talkers
and
clerks
god
knows
that
all
sorts
of
gentlemen
knock
at
the
door
but
whenever
used
in
strictness
and
with
any
emphasis
the
name
will
be
found
to
point
at
original
energy
it
describes
a
man
standing
in
his
own
right
and
working
after
untaught
methods
in
a
good
lord
there
must
first
be
a
good
animal
at
least
to
the
extent
of
yielding
the
incomparable
advantage
of
animal
spirits
the
ruling
class
must
have
more
but
they
must
have
these
giving
in
every
company
the
sense
of
power
which
makes
things
easy
to
be
done
which
daunt
the
wise
the
society
of
the
energetic
class
in
their
friendly
and
festive
meetings
is
full
of
courage
and
of
attempts
which
intimidate
the
pale
scholar
the
courage
which
girls
exhibit
is
like
a
battle
of
lundy
lane
or
a
the
intellect
relies
on
memory
to
make
some
supplies
to
face
these
extemporaneous
squadrons
but
memory
is
a
base
mendicant
with
basket
and
badge
in
the
presence
of
these
sudden
masters
the
rulers
of
society
must
be
up
to
the
work
of
the
world
and
equal
to
their
versatile
office
men
of
the
right
cæsarian
pattern
who
have
great
range
of
affinity
i
am
far
from
believing
the
timid
maxim
of
lord
falkland
that
for
ceremony
there
must
go
two
to
it
since
a
bold
fellow
will
go
through
the
cunningest
forms
and
am
of
opinion
that
the
gentleman
is
the
bold
fellow
whose
forms
are
not
to
be
broken
through
and
only
that
plenteous
nature
is
rightful
master
which
is
the
complement
of
whatever
person
it
converses
with
my
gentleman
gives
the
law
where
he
is
he
will
outpray
saints
in
chapel
outgeneral
veterans
in
the
field
and
outshine
all
courtesy
in
the
hall
he
is
good
company
for
pirates
and
good
with
academicians
so
that
it
is
useless
to
fortify
yourself
against
him
he
has
the
private
entrance
to
all
minds
and
i
could
as
easily
exclude
myself
as
him
the
famous
gentlemen
of
asia
and
europe
have
been
of
this
strong
type
saladin
sapor
the
cid
julius
cæsar
scipio
alexander
pericles
and
the
lordliest
personages
they
sat
very
carelessly
in
their
chairs
and
were
too
excellent
themselves
to
value
any
condition
at
a
high
rate
a
plentiful
fortune
is
reckoned
necessary
in
the
popular
judgment
to
the
completion
of
this
man
of
the
world
and
it
is
a
material
deputy
which
walks
through
the
dance
which
the
first
has
led
money
is
not
essential
but
this
wide
affinity
is
which
transcends
the
habits
of
clique
and
caste
and
makes
itself
felt
by
men
of
all
classes
if
the
aristocrat
is
only
valid
in
fashionable
circles
and
not
with
truckmen
he
will
never
be
a
leader
in
fashion
and
if
the
man
of
the
people
can
not
speak
on
equal
terms
with
the
gentleman
so
that
the
gentleman
shall
perceive
that
he
is
already
really
of
his
own
order
he
is
not
to
be
feared
diogenes
socrates
and
epaminondas
are
gentlemen
of
the
best
blood
who
have
chosen
the
condition
of
poverty
when
that
of
wealth
was
equally
open
to
them
i
use
these
old
names
but
the
men
i
speak
of
are
my
contemporaries
fortune
will
not
supply
to
every
generation
one
of
these
knights
but
every
collection
of
men
furnishes
some
example
of
the
class
and
the
politics
of
this
country
and
the
trade
of
every
town
are
controlled
by
these
hardy
and
irresponsible
doers
who
have
invention
to
take
the
lead
and
a
broad
sympathy
which
puts
them
in
fellowship
with
crowds
and
makes
their
action
popular
the
manners
of
this
class
are
observed
and
caught
with
devotion
by
men
of
taste
the
association
of
these
masters
with
each
other
and
with
men
intelligent
of
their
merits
is
mutually
agreeable
and
stimulating
the
good
forms
the
happiest
expressions
of
each
are
repeated
and
adopted
by
swift
consent
everything
superfluous
is
dropped
everything
graceful
is
renewed
fine
manners
show
themselves
formidable
to
the
uncultivated
man
they
are
a
subtler
science
of
defence
to
parry
and
intimidate
but
once
matched
by
the
skill
of
the
other
party
they
drop
the
point
of
the
sword
points
and
fences
disappear
and
the
youth
finds
himself
in
a
more
transparent
atmosphere
wherein
life
is
a
less
troublesome
game
and
not
a
misunderstanding
rises
between
the
players
manners
aim
to
facilitate
life
to
get
rid
of
impediments
and
bring
the
man
pure
to
energize
they
aid
our
dealing
and
conversation
as
a
railway
aids
traveling
by
getting
rid
of
all
avoidable
obstructions
of
the
road
and
leaving
nothing
to
be
conquered
but
pure
space
these
forms
very
soon
become
fixed
and
a
fine
sense
of
propriety
is
cultivated
with
more
heed
that
it
becomes
a
badge
of
social
and
civil
distinctions
thus
grows
up
fashion
an
equivocal
semblance
the
most
puissant
the
most
fantastic
and
frivolous
the
most
feared
and
followed
and
which
morals
and
violence
assault
in
vain
there
exists
a
strict
relation
between
the
class
of
power
and
the
exclusive
and
polished
circles
the
last
are
always
filled
or
filling
from
the
first
the
strong
men
usually
give
some
allowance
even
to
the
petulances
of
fashion
for
that
affinity
they
find
in
it
napoleon
child
of
the
revolution
destroyer
of
the
old
noblesse
never
ceased
to
court
the
faubourg
germain
doubtless
with
the
feeling
that
fashion
is
a
homage
to
men
of
his
stamp
fashion
though
in
a
strange
way
represents
all
manly
virtue
it
is
a
virtue
gone
to
seed
it
is
a
kind
of
posthumous
honor
it
does
not
often
caress
the
great
but
the
children
of
the
great
it
is
a
hall
of
the
past
it
usually
sets
its
face
against
the
great
of
this
hour
great
men
are
not
commonly
in
its
halls
they
are
absent
in
the
field
they
are
working
not
triumphing
fashion
is
made
up
of
their
children
of
those
who
through
the
value
and
virtue
of
somebody
have
acquired
lustre
to
their
name
marks
of
distinction
means
of
cultivation
and
generosity
and
in
their
physical
organization
a
certain
health
and
excellence
which
secures
to
them
if
not
the
highest
power
to
work
yet
high
power
to
enjoy
the
class
of
power
the
working
heroes
the
cortez
the
nelson
the
napoleon
see
that
this
is
the
festivity
and
permanent
celebration
of
such
as
they
that
fashion
is
funded
talent
is
mexico
marengo
and
trafalgar
beaten
out
thin
that
the
brilliant
names
of
fashion
run
back
to
just
such
busy
names
as
their
own
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
they
are
the
sowers
their
sons
shall
be
the
reapers
and
sons
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
must
yield
the
possession
of
the
harvest
to
new
competitors
with
keener
eyes
and
stronger
frames
the
city
is
recruited
from
the
country
in
the
year
it
is
said
every
legitimate
monarch
in
europe
was
imbecile
the
city
would
have
died
out
rotted
and
exploded
long
ago
but
that
it
was
reinforced
from
the
fields
it
is
only
country
which
came
to
town
day
before
yesterday
that
is
city
and
court
aristocracy
and
fashion
are
certain
inevitable
results
these
mutual
selections
are
indestructible
if
they
provoke
anger
in
the
least
favored
class
and
the
excluded
majority
revenge
themselves
on
the
excluding
minority
by
the
strong
hand
and
kill
them
at
once
a
new
class
finds
itself
at
the
top
as
certainly
as
cream
rises
in
a
bowl
of
milk
and
if
the
people
should
destroy
class
after
class
until
two
men
only
were
left
one
of
these
would
be
the
leader
and
would
be
involuntarily
served
and
copied
by
the
other
you
may
keep
this
minority
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
but
it
is
tenacious
of
life
and
is
one
of
the
estates
of
the
realm
i
am
the
more
struck
with
this
tenacity
when
i
see
its
work
it
respects
the
administration
of
such
unimportant
matters
that
we
should
not
look
for
any
durability
in
its
rule
we
sometimes
meet
men
under
some
strong
moral
influence
as
a
patriotic
a
literary
a
religious
movement
and
feel
that
the
moral
sentiment
rules
man
and
nature
we
think
all
other
distinctions
and
ties
will
be
slight
and
fugitive
this
of
caste
or
fashion
for
example
yet
come
from
year
to
year
and
see
how
permanent
that
is
in
this
boston
or
new
york
life
of
man
where
too
it
has
not
the
lease
countenance
from
the
law
of
the
land
not
in
egypt
or
in
india
a
firmer
or
more
impassable
line
here
are
associations
whose
ties
go
over
and
under
and
through
it
a
meeting
of
merchants
a
military
corps
a
a
a
professional
association
a
political
a
religious
convention
the
persons
seem
to
draw
inseparably
near
yet
that
assembly
once
dispersed
its
members
will
not
in
the
year
meet
again
each
returns
to
his
degree
in
the
scale
of
good
society
porcelain
remains
porcelain
and
earthen
earthen
the
objects
of
fashion
may
be
frivolous
or
fashion
may
be
objectless
but
the
nature
of
this
union
and
selection
can
be
neither
frivolous
nor
accidental
each
man
rank
in
that
perfect
graduation
depends
on
some
symmetry
in
his
structure
or
some
agreement
in
his
structure
to
the
symmetry
of
society
its
doors
unbar
instantaneously
to
a
natural
claim
of
their
own
kind
a
natural
gentleman
finds
his
way
in
and
will
keep
the
oldest
patrician
out
who
has
lost
his
intrinsic
rank
fashion
understands
itself
and
personal
superiority
of
whatever
country
readily
fraternize
with
those
of
every
other
the
chiefs
of
savage
tribes
have
distinguished
themselves
in
london
and
paris
by
the
purity
of
their
tournure
to
say
what
good
of
fashion
we
can
it
rests
on
reality
and
hates
nothing
so
much
as
pretenders
to
exclude
and
mystify
pretenders
and
send
them
into
everlasting
coventry
is
its
delight
we
contemn
in
turn
every
other
gift
of
men
of
the
world
but
the
habit
even
in
little
and
the
least
matters
of
not
appealing
to
any
but
our
own
sense
of
propriety
constitutes
the
foundation
of
all
chivalry
there
is
almost
no
kind
of
so
it
be
sane
and
proportioned
which
fashion
does
not
occasionally
adopt
and
give
it
the
freedom
of
its
saloons
a
sainted
soul
is
always
elegant
and
if
it
will
passes
unchallenged
into
the
most
guarded
ring
but
so
will
jock
the
teamster
pass
in
some
crisis
that
brings
him
thither
and
find
favor
as
long
as
his
head
is
not
giddy
with
the
new
circumstance
and
the
iron
shoes
do
not
wish
to
dance
in
waltzes
and
cotillions
for
there
is
nothing
settled
in
manners
but
the
laws
of
behavior
yield
to
the
energy
of
the
individual
the
maiden
at
her
first
ball
the
countryman
at
a
city
dinner
believes
that
there
is
a
ritual
according
to
which
every
act
and
compliment
must
be
performed
or
the
failing
party
must
be
cast
out
of
this
presence
later
they
learn
that
good
sense
and
character
make
their
own
forms
every
moment
and
speak
or
abstain
to
take
wine
or
refuse
it
stay
or
go
sit
in
a
chair
or
sprawl
with
children
on
the
floor
or
stand
on
their
head
or
what
else
soever
in
a
new
and
aboriginal
way
and
that
strong
will
is
always
in
fashion
let
who
will
be
unfashionable
all
that
fashion
demands
is
composure
and
a
circle
of
men
perfectly
would
be
a
company
of
sensible
persons
in
which
every
native
manners
and
character
appear
if
the
fashionist
have
not
this
quality
he
is
nothing
we
are
such
lovers
of
that
we
excuse
in
man
many
sins
if
he
will
show
us
a
complete
satisfaction
in
his
position
which
asks
no
leave
to
be
of
mine
or
any
man
good
opinion
but
any
deference
to
some
eminent
man
or
woman
of
the
world
forfeits
all
privilege
of
nobility
he
is
an
underling
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
i
will
speak
with
his
master
a
man
should
not
go
where
he
can
not
carry
his
whole
sphere
or
society
with
him
not
bodily
the
whole
circle
of
his
friends
but
atmospherically
he
should
preserve
in
a
new
company
the
same
attitude
of
mind
and
reality
of
relation
which
his
daily
associates
draw
him
to
else
he
is
shorn
of
his
best
beams
and
will
be
an
orphan
in
the
merriest
club
if
you
could
see
vich
ian
vohr
with
his
tail
on
but
vich
ian
vohr
must
always
carry
his
belongings
in
some
fashion
if
not
added
as
honor
then
severed
as
disgrace
there
will
always
be
in
society
certain
persons
who
are
mercuries
of
its
approbation
and
whose
glance
will
at
any
time
determine
for
the
curious
their
standing
in
the
world
these
are
the
chamberlains
of
the
lesser
gods
accept
their
coldness
as
an
omen
of
grace
with
the
loftier
deities
and
allow
them
all
their
privilege
they
are
clear
in
their
office
nor
could
they
be
thus
formidable
without
their
own
merits
but
do
not
measure
the
importance
of
this
class
by
their
pretension
or
imagine
that
a
fop
can
be
the
dispenser
of
honor
and
shame
they
pass
also
at
their
just
rate
for
how
can
they
otherwise
in
circles
which
exist
as
a
sort
of
office
for
the
sifting
of
character
as
the
first
thing
man
requires
of
man
is
reality
so
that
appears
in
all
the
forms
of
society
we
pointedly
and
by
name
introduce
the
parties
to
each
other
know
you
before
all
heaven
and
earth
that
this
is
andrew
and
this
is
gregory
they
look
each
other
in
the
eye
they
grasp
each
other
hand
to
identify
and
signalize
each
other
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
a
gentleman
never
dodges
his
eyes
look
straight
forward
and
he
assures
the
other
party
first
of
all
that
he
has
been
met
for
what
is
it
that
we
seek
in
so
many
visits
and
hospitalities
is
it
your
draperies
pictures
and
decorations
or
do
we
not
insatiably
ask
was
a
man
in
the
house
i
may
easily
go
into
a
great
household
where
there
is
much
substance
excellent
provision
for
comfort
luxury
and
taste
and
yet
not
encounter
there
any
amphitryon
who
shall
subordinate
these
appendages
i
may
go
into
a
cottage
and
find
a
farmer
who
feels
that
he
is
the
man
i
have
come
to
see
and
fronts
me
accordingly
it
was
therefore
a
very
natural
point
of
old
feudal
etiquette
that
a
gentleman
who
received
a
visit
though
it
were
of
his
sovereign
should
not
leave
his
roof
but
should
wait
his
arrival
at
the
door
of
his
house
no
house
though
it
were
the
tuileries
or
the
escurial
is
good
for
anything
without
a
master
and
yet
we
are
not
often
gratified
by
this
hospitality
everybody
we
know
surrounds
himself
with
a
fine
house
fine
books
conservatory
gardens
equipage
and
all
manner
of
toys
as
screens
to
interpose
between
himself
and
his
guests
does
it
not
seem
as
if
man
was
of
a
very
sly
elusive
nature
and
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
a
full
renconter
front
to
front
with
his
fellow
it
were
unmerciful
i
know
quite
to
abolish
the
use
of
these
screens
which
are
of
eminent
convenience
whether
the
guest
is
too
great
or
too
little
we
call
together
many
friends
who
keep
each
other
in
play
or
by
luxuries
and
ornaments
we
amuse
the
young
people
and
guard
our
retirement
or
if
perchance
a
searching
realist
comes
to
our
gate
before
whose
eyes
we
have
no
care
to
stand
then
again
we
run
to
our
curtain
and
hide
ourselves
as
adam
at
the
voice
of
the
lord
god
in
the
garden
cardinal
caprara
the
pope
legate
at
paris
defended
himself
from
the
glances
of
napoleon
by
an
immense
pair
of
green
spectacles
napoleon
remarked
them
and
speedily
managed
to
rally
them
off
and
yet
napoleon
in
his
turn
was
not
great
enough
with
eight
hundred
thousand
troops
at
his
back
to
face
a
pair
of
eyes
but
fenced
himself
with
etiquette
and
within
triple
barriers
of
reserve
and
as
all
the
world
knows
from
madame
de
stael
was
wont
when
he
found
himself
observed
to
discharge
his
face
of
all
expression
but
emperors
and
rich
men
are
by
no
means
the
most
skillful
masters
of
good
manners
no
rent
roll
nor
can
dignify
skulking
and
dissimulations
and
the
first
point
of
courtesy
must
always
be
truth
as
really
all
forms
of
point
that
way
i
have
just
been
reading
in
hazlitt
translation
montaigne
account
of
his
journey
into
italy
and
am
struck
with
nothing
more
agreeably
than
the
fashions
of
the
time
his
arrival
in
each
place
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
of
france
is
an
event
of
some
consequence
wherever
he
goes
he
pays
a
visit
to
whatever
prince
or
gentleman
of
note
resides
upon
his
road
as
a
duty
to
himself
and
to
civilization
when
he
leaves
any
house
in
which
he
has
lodged
for
a
few
weeks
he
causes
his
arms
to
be
painted
and
hung
up
as
a
perpetual
sign
to
the
house
as
was
the
custom
of
gentlemen
the
complement
of
this
graceful
and
that
of
all
the
points
of
good
breeding
i
most
require
and
insist
upon
is
deference
i
like
that
every
chair
should
be
a
throne
and
hold
a
king
i
prefer
a
tendency
to
stateliness
to
an
excess
of
fellowship
let
the
incommunicable
objects
of
nature
and
the
metaphysical
isolation
of
man
teach
us
independence
let
us
not
be
too
much
acquainted
i
would
have
a
man
enter
his
house
through
a
hall
filled
with
heroic
and
sacred
sculptures
that
he
might
not
want
the
hint
of
tranquillity
and
we
should
meet
each
morning
as
from
foreign
countries
and
spending
the
day
together
should
depart
at
night
as
into
foreign
countries
in
all
things
i
would
have
the
island
of
a
man
inviolate
let
us
sit
apart
as
the
gods
talking
from
peak
to
peak
all
round
olympus
no
degree
of
affection
need
invade
this
religion
this
is
myrrh
and
rosemary
to
keep
the
other
sweet
lovers
should
guard
their
strangeness
if
they
forgive
too
much
all
slides
into
confusion
and
meanness
it
is
easy
to
push
this
deference
to
a
chinese
etiquette
but
coolness
and
absence
of
heat
and
haste
indicate
fine
qualities
a
gentleman
makes
no
noise
a
lady
is
serene
proportionate
is
our
disgust
at
those
invaders
who
fill
a
studious
house
with
blast
and
running
to
secure
some
paltry
convenience
not
less
i
dislike
a
low
sympathy
of
each
with
his
neighbors
needs
must
we
have
a
good
understanding
with
one
another
palates
as
foolish
people
who
have
lived
long
together
know
when
each
wants
salt
or
sugar
i
pray
my
companion
if
he
wishes
for
bread
to
ask
me
for
bread
and
if
he
wishes
for
sassafras
or
arsenic
to
ask
me
for
them
and
not
to
hold
out
his
plate
as
if
i
knew
already
every
natural
function
can
be
dignified
by
deliberation
and
privacy
let
us
leave
hurry
to
slaves
the
compliments
and
ceremonies
of
our
breeding
should
recall
however
remotely
the
grandeur
of
our
destiny
the
flower
of
courtesy
does
not
very
well
bide
handling
but
if
we
dare
to
open
another
leaf
and
explore
what
parts
go
to
its
conformation
we
shall
find
also
an
intellectual
quality
to
the
leaders
of
men
the
brain
as
well
as
the
flesh
and
the
heart
must
furnish
a
proportion
defect
in
manners
is
usually
the
defect
of
fine
perceptions
men
are
too
coarsely
made
for
the
delicacy
of
beautiful
carriage
and
customs
it
is
not
quite
sufficient
to
good
breeding
a
union
of
kindness
and
independence
we
imperatively
require
a
perception
of
and
a
homage
to
beauty
in
our
companions
other
virtues
are
in
request
in
the
field
and
work
yard
but
a
certain
degree
of
taste
is
not
to
be
spared
in
those
we
sit
with
i
could
better
eat
with
one
who
did
not
respect
the
truth
or
the
laws
than
with
a
sloven
and
unpresentable
person
moral
qualities
rule
the
world
but
at
short
distances
the
senses
are
despotic
the
same
discrimination
of
fit
and
fair
runs
out
if
with
less
rigor
into
all
parts
of
life
the
average
spirit
of
the
energetic
class
is
good
sense
acting
under
certain
limitations
and
to
certain
ends
it
entertains
every
natural
gift
social
in
its
nature
it
respects
everything
which
tends
to
unite
men
it
delights
in
measure
the
love
of
beauty
is
mainly
the
love
of
measure
or
proportion
the
person
who
screams
or
uses
the
superlative
degree
or
converses
with
heat
puts
whole
to
flight
if
you
wish
to
be
loved
love
measure
you
must
have
genius
or
a
prodigious
usefulness
if
you
will
hide
the
want
of
measure
this
perception
comes
in
to
polish
and
perfect
the
parts
of
the
social
instrument
society
will
pardon
much
to
genius
and
special
gifts
but
being
in
its
nature
a
convention
it
loves
what
is
conventional
or
what
belongs
to
coming
together
that
makes
the
good
and
bad
of
manners
namely
what
helps
or
hinders
fellowship
for
fashion
is
not
good
sense
absolute
but
relative
not
good
sense
private
but
good
sense
entertaining
company
it
hates
corners
and
sharp
points
of
character
hates
quarrelsome
egotistical
solitary
and
gloomy
people
hates
whatever
can
interfere
with
total
blending
of
parties
whilst
it
values
all
peculiarities
as
in
the
highest
degree
refreshing
which
can
consist
with
good
fellowship
and
besides
the
general
infusion
of
wit
to
heighten
civility
the
direct
splendor
of
intellectual
power
is
ever
welcome
in
fine
society
as
the
costliest
addition
to
its
rule
and
its
credit
the
dry
light
must
shine
in
to
adorn
our
festival
but
it
must
be
tempered
and
shaded
or
that
will
also
offend
accuracy
is
essential
to
beauty
and
quick
perceptions
to
politeness
but
not
too
quick
perceptions
one
may
be
too
punctual
and
too
precise
he
must
leave
the
omniscience
of
business
at
the
door
when
he
comes
into
the
palace
of
beauty
society
loves
creole
natures
and
sleepy
languishing
manners
so
that
they
cover
sense
grace
and
the
air
of
drowsy
strength
which
disarms
criticism
perhaps
because
such
a
person
seems
to
reserve
himself
for
the
best
of
the
game
and
not
spend
himself
on
surfaces
an
ignoring
eye
which
does
not
see
the
annoyances
shifts
and
inconveniences
that
cloud
the
brow
and
smother
the
voice
of
the
sensitive
therefore
besides
personal
force
and
so
much
perception
as
constitutes
unerring
taste
society
demands
in
its
patrician
class
another
element
already
intimated
which
it
significantly
terms
expressing
all
degrees
of
generosity
from
the
lowest
willingness
and
faculty
to
oblige
up
to
the
heights
of
magnanimity
and
love
insight
we
must
have
or
we
shall
run
against
one
another
and
miss
the
way
to
our
food
but
intellect
is
selfish
and
barren
the
secret
of
success
in
society
is
a
certain
heartiness
and
sympathy
a
man
who
is
not
happy
in
the
company
can
not
find
any
word
in
his
memory
that
will
fit
the
occasion
all
his
information
is
a
little
impertinent
a
man
who
is
happy
there
finds
in
every
turn
of
the
conversation
equally
lucky
occasions
for
the
introduction
of
that
which
he
has
to
say
the
favorites
of
society
and
what
it
calls
are
able
men
and
of
more
spirit
than
wit
who
have
no
uncomfortable
egotism
but
who
exactly
fill
the
hour
and
the
company
contented
and
contenting
at
a
marriage
or
a
funeral
a
ball
or
a
jury
a
or
a
england
which
is
rich
in
gentlemen
furnished
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
a
good
model
of
that
genius
which
the
world
loves
in
fox
who
added
to
his
great
abilities
the
most
social
disposition
and
real
love
of
men
parliamentary
history
has
few
better
passages
than
the
debate
in
which
burke
and
fox
separated
in
the
house
of
commons
when
fox
urged
on
his
old
friend
the
claims
of
old
friendship
with
such
tenderness
that
the
house
was
moved
to
tears
another
anecdote
is
so
close
to
my
matter
that
i
must
hazard
the
story
a
tradesman
who
had
long
dunned
him
for
a
note
of
three
hundred
guineas
found
him
one
day
counting
gold
and
demanded
payment
no
said
fox
i
owe
this
money
to
sheridan
it
is
a
debt
of
honor
if
an
accident
should
happen
to
me
he
has
nothing
to
show
then
said
the
creditor
i
change
my
debt
into
a
debt
of
honor
and
tore
the
note
in
pieces
fox
thanked
the
man
for
his
confidence
and
paid
him
saying
his
debt
was
of
older
standing
and
sheridan
must
wait
lover
of
liberty
friend
of
the
hindoo
friend
of
the
african
slave
he
possessed
a
great
personal
popularity
and
napoleon
said
of
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
visit
to
paris
in
fox
will
always
hold
the
first
place
in
an
assembly
at
the
tuileries
we
may
easily
seem
ridiculous
in
our
eulogy
of
courtesy
whenever
we
insist
on
benevolence
as
its
foundation
the
painted
phantasm
fashion
rises
to
cast
a
species
of
derision
on
what
we
say
but
i
will
neither
be
driven
from
some
allowance
to
fashion
as
a
symbolic
institution
nor
from
the
belief
that
love
is
the
basis
of
courtesy
we
must
obtain
if
we
can
but
by
all
means
we
must
affirm
life
owes
much
of
its
spirit
to
these
sharp
contrasts
fashion
which
affects
to
be
honor
is
often
in
all
men
experience
only
a
ballroom
code
yet
so
long
as
it
is
the
highest
circle
in
the
imagination
of
the
best
heads
on
the
planet
there
is
something
necessary
and
excellent
in
it
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
men
have
agreed
to
be
the
dupes
of
anything
preposterous
and
the
respect
which
these
mysteries
inspire
in
the
most
rude
and
sylvan
characters
and
the
curiosity
with
which
details
of
high
life
are
read
betray
the
universality
of
the
love
of
cultivated
manners
i
know
that
a
comic
disparity
would
be
felt
if
we
should
enter
the
acknowledged
circles
and
apply
these
terrific
standards
of
justice
beauty
and
benefit
to
the
individuals
actually
found
there
monarchs
and
heroes
sages
and
lovers
these
gallants
are
not
fashion
has
many
classes
and
many
rules
of
probation
and
admission
and
not
the
best
alone
there
is
not
only
the
right
of
conquest
which
genius
pretends
the
individual
demonstrating
his
natural
aristocracy
best
of
the
best
but
less
claims
will
pass
for
the
time
for
fashion
loves
lions
and
points
like
circe
to
her
horned
company
this
gentleman
is
this
afternoon
arrived
from
denmark
and
that
is
my
lord
ride
who
came
yesterday
from
bagdad
here
is
captain
friese
from
cape
turnagain
and
captain
symmes
from
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
monsieur
jovaire
who
came
down
this
morning
in
a
balloon
hobnail
the
reformer
and
reverend
jul
bat
who
has
converted
the
whole
torrid
zone
in
his
sunday
school
and
signer
torre
del
greco
who
extinguished
vesuvius
by
pouring
into
it
the
bay
of
naples
spahr
the
persian
ambassador
and
tul
wil
shan
the
exiled
nabob
of
nepaul
whose
saddle
is
the
new
but
these
are
monsters
of
one
day
and
will
be
dismissed
to
their
holes
and
dens
for
in
these
rooms
every
chair
is
waited
for
the
artist
the
scholar
and
in
general
the
clerisy
wins
its
way
up
into
these
places
and
gets
represented
here
somewhat
on
this
footing
of
conquest
another
mode
is
to
pass
through
all
the
degrees
spending
a
year
and
a
day
in
michael
square
being
steeped
in
cologne
water
and
perfumed
and
dined
and
introduced
and
properly
grounded
in
all
the
biography
and
politics
and
anecdotes
of
the
boudoirs
yet
these
fineries
may
have
grace
and
wit
let
there
be
grotesque
sculpture
about
the
gates
and
offices
of
temples
let
the
creed
and
commandments
even
have
the
saucy
homage
of
parody
the
forms
of
politeness
universally
express
benevolence
in
superlative
degrees
what
if
they
are
in
the
mouths
of
selfish
men
and
used
as
means
of
selfishness
what
if
the
false
gentleman
almost
bows
the
true
out
of
the
world
what
if
the
false
gentleman
contrives
so
to
address
his
companion
as
civilly
to
exclude
all
others
from
his
discourse
and
also
to
make
them
feel
excluded
real
service
will
not
lose
its
nobleness
all
generosity
is
not
merely
french
and
sentimental
nor
is
it
to
be
concealed
that
living
blood
and
a
passion
of
kindness
does
at
last
distinguish
god
gentleman
from
fashion
the
epitaph
of
sir
jenkin
grout
is
not
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
present
age
here
lies
sir
jenkin
grout
who
loved
his
friend
and
persuaded
his
enemy
what
his
mouth
ate
his
hand
paid
for
what
his
servants
robbed
he
restored
if
a
woman
gave
him
pleasure
he
supported
her
in
pain
he
never
forgot
his
children
and
whoso
touched
his
finger
drew
after
it
his
whole
body
even
the
line
of
heroes
is
not
utterly
extinct
there
is
still
ever
some
admirable
person
in
plain
clothes
standing
on
the
wharf
who
jumps
in
to
rescue
a
drowning
man
there
is
still
some
absurd
inventor
of
charities
some
guide
and
comforter
of
runaway
slaves
some
friend
of
poland
some
philhellene
some
fanatic
who
plants
for
the
second
and
third
generation
and
orchards
when
he
is
grown
old
some
piety
some
just
man
happy
in
an
some
youth
ashamed
of
the
favors
of
fortune
and
impatiently
casting
them
on
other
shoulders
and
these
are
the
centers
of
society
on
which
it
returns
for
fresh
impulses
these
are
the
creators
of
fashion
which
is
an
attempt
to
organize
beauty
of
behavior
the
beautiful
and
the
generous
are
in
the
theory
the
doctors
and
apostles
of
this
church
scipio
and
the
cid
and
sir
philip
sidney
and
washington
and
every
pure
and
valiant
heart
who
worshiped
beauty
by
word
and
by
deed
the
persons
who
constitute
the
natural
aristocracy
are
not
found
in
the
actual
aristocracy
or
only
on
its
edge
as
the
chemical
energy
of
the
spectrum
is
found
to
be
greatest
just
outside
of
the
spectrum
yet
that
is
the
infirmity
of
the
seneschals
who
do
not
know
their
sovereign
when
he
appears
the
theory
of
society
supposes
the
existence
and
sovereignty
of
these
it
divines
afar
off
their
coming
it
says
with
the
elder
gods
as
heaven
and
earth
are
fairer
far
than
chaos
and
blank
darkness
though
once
chiefs
and
as
we
show
beyond
that
heaven
and
earth
in
form
and
shape
compact
and
beautiful
so
on
our
heels
a
fresh
perfection
treads
a
power
more
strong
in
beauty
born
of
us
and
fated
to
excel
us
as
we
pass
in
glory
that
old
darkness
for
is
the
eternal
law
that
first
in
beauty
shall
be
first
in
might
therefore
within
the
ethnical
circle
of
good
society
there
is
a
narrower
and
higher
circle
concentration
of
its
light
and
flower
of
courtesy
to
which
there
is
always
a
tacit
appeal
of
pride
and
reference
as
to
its
inner
and
imperial
court
the
parliament
of
love
and
chivalry
and
this
is
constituted
of
those
persons
in
whom
heroic
dispositions
are
native
with
the
love
of
beauty
the
delight
in
society
and
the
power
to
embellish
the
passing
day
if
the
individuals
who
compose
the
purest
circles
of
aristocracy
in
europe
the
guarded
blood
of
centuries
should
pass
in
review
in
such
manner
as
that
we
could
leisurely
and
critically
inspect
their
behavior
we
might
find
no
gentleman
and
no
lady
for
although
excellent
specimens
of
courtesy
and
would
gratify
us
in
the
assemblage
in
the
particulars
we
should
detect
offense
because
elegance
comes
of
no
breeding
but
of
birth
there
must
be
romance
of
character
or
the
most
fastidious
exclusion
of
impertinencies
will
not
avail
it
must
be
genius
which
takes
that
direction
it
must
be
not
courteous
but
courtesy
high
behavior
is
as
rare
in
fiction
as
it
is
in
fact
scott
is
praised
for
the
fidelity
with
which
he
painted
the
demeanor
and
conversation
of
the
superior
classes
certainly
kings
and
queens
nobles
and
great
ladies
had
some
right
to
complain
of
the
absurdity
that
had
been
put
in
their
mouths
before
the
days
of
waverley
but
neither
does
scott
dialogue
bear
criticism
his
lords
brave
each
other
in
smart
epigrammatic
speeches
but
the
dialogue
is
in
costume
and
does
not
please
on
the
second
reading
it
is
not
warm
with
life
in
shakespeare
alone
the
speakers
do
not
strut
and
bridle
the
dialogue
is
easily
great
and
he
adds
to
so
many
titles
that
of
being
the
man
in
england
and
in
christendom
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
we
are
permitted
to
enjoy
the
charm
of
noble
manners
in
the
presence
of
a
man
or
woman
who
have
no
bar
in
their
nature
but
whose
character
emanates
freely
in
their
word
and
gesture
a
beautiful
form
is
better
than
a
beautiful
face
a
beautiful
behavior
is
better
than
a
beautiful
form
it
gives
a
higher
pleasure
than
statues
or
pictures
it
is
the
finest
of
the
fine
arts
a
man
is
but
a
little
thing
in
the
midst
of
the
objects
of
nature
yet
by
the
moral
quality
radiating
from
his
countenance
he
may
abolish
all
considerations
of
magnitude
and
in
his
manners
equal
the
majesty
of
the
world
i
have
seen
an
individual
whose
manners
though
wholly
within
the
conventions
of
elegant
society
were
never
learned
there
but
were
original
and
commanding
and
held
out
protection
and
prosperity
one
who
did
not
need
the
aid
of
a
but
carried
the
holiday
in
his
eye
who
exhilarated
the
fancy
by
flinging
wide
the
doors
of
new
modes
of
existence
who
shook
off
the
captivity
of
etiquette
with
happy
spirited
bearing
and
free
as
robin
hood
yet
with
the
port
of
an
emperor
if
need
be
calm
serious
and
fit
to
stand
the
gaze
of
millions
the
open
air
and
the
fields
the
street
and
public
chambers
are
the
places
where
man
executes
his
will
let
him
yield
or
divide
the
scepter
at
the
door
of
the
house
woman
with
her
instinct
of
behavior
instantly
detects
in
man
a
love
of
trifles
any
coldness
or
imbecility
or
in
short
any
want
of
that
large
flowing
and
magnanimous
deportment
which
is
indispensable
as
an
exterior
in
the
hall
our
american
institutions
have
been
friendly
to
her
and
at
this
moment
i
esteem
it
a
chief
felicity
of
this
country
that
it
excels
in
women
a
certain
awkward
consciousness
of
inferiority
in
the
men
may
give
rise
to
the
new
chivalry
in
behalf
of
woman
rights
certainly
let
her
be
as
much
better
placed
in
the
laws
and
in
social
forms
as
the
most
zealous
reformer
can
ask
but
i
confide
so
entirely
in
her
inspiring
and
musical
nature
that
i
believe
only
herself
can
show
us
how
she
shall
be
served
the
wonderful
generosity
of
her
sentiments
raises
her
at
times
into
heroical
and
godlike
regions
and
verifies
the
pictures
of
minerva
juno
or
polymnia
and
by
the
firmness
with
which
she
treads
her
upward
path
she
convinces
the
coarsest
calculators
that
another
road
exists
than
that
which
their
feet
know
but
besides
those
who
make
good
in
our
imagination
the
place
of
muses
and
of
delphic
sibyls
are
there
not
women
who
fill
our
vase
with
wine
and
roses
to
the
brim
so
that
the
wine
runs
over
and
fills
the
house
with
perfume
who
inspire
us
with
courtesy
who
unloose
our
tongues
and
we
speak
who
anoint
our
eyes
and
we
see
we
say
things
we
never
thought
to
have
said
for
once
our
walls
of
habitual
reserve
vanished
and
left
us
at
large
we
were
children
playing
with
children
in
a
wide
field
of
flowers
steep
us
we
cried
in
these
influences
for
days
for
weeks
and
we
shall
be
sunny
poets
and
will
write
out
in
words
the
romance
that
you
are
was
it
hafiz
or
firdousi
that
said
of
his
persian
lilla
she
was
an
elemental
force
and
astonished
me
by
her
amount
of
life
when
i
saw
her
day
after
day
radiating
every
instant
redundant
joy
and
grace
on
all
around
her
she
was
a
solvent
powerful
to
reconcile
all
heterogeneous
persons
into
one
society
like
air
or
water
an
element
of
such
a
great
range
of
affinities
that
it
combines
readily
with
a
thousand
substances
where
she
is
present
all
others
will
be
more
than
they
are
wont
she
was
a
unit
and
whole
so
that
whatsoever
she
did
became
her
she
had
too
much
sympathy
and
desire
to
please
than
that
you
could
say
her
manners
were
marked
with
dignity
yet
no
princess
could
surpass
her
clear
and
erect
demeanor
on
each
occasion
she
did
not
study
the
persian
grammar
nor
the
books
of
the
seven
poets
but
all
the
poems
of
the
seven
seemed
to
be
written
upon
her
for
though
the
bias
of
her
nature
was
not
to
thought
but
to
sympathy
yet
was
she
so
perfect
in
her
own
nature
as
to
meet
intellectual
persons
by
the
fullness
of
her
heart
warming
them
by
her
sentiments
believing
as
she
did
that
by
dealing
nobly
with
all
all
would
show
themselves
noble
i
know
that
this
byzantine
pile
of
chivalry
of
fashion
which
seems
so
fair
and
picturesque
to
those
who
look
at
the
contemporary
facts
for
science
or
for
entertainment
is
not
equally
pleasant
to
all
spectators
the
constitution
of
our
society
makes
it
a
giant
castle
to
the
ambitious
youth
who
have
not
found
their
names
enrolled
in
its
golden
book
and
whom
it
has
excluded
from
its
coveted
honors
and
privileges
they
have
yet
to
learn
that
its
seeming
grandeur
is
shadowy
and
relative
it
is
great
by
their
allowance
its
proudest
gates
will
fly
open
at
the
approach
of
their
courage
and
virtue
for
the
present
distress
however
of
those
who
are
predisposed
to
suffer
from
the
tyrannies
of
this
caprice
there
are
easy
remedies
to
remove
your
residence
a
couple
of
miles
or
at
most
four
will
commonly
relieve
the
most
extreme
susceptibility
for
the
advantages
which
fashion
values
are
plants
which
thrive
in
very
confined
localities
in
a
few
streets
namely
out
of
this
precinct
they
go
for
nothing
are
of
no
use
in
the
farm
in
the
forest
in
the
market
in
war
in
the
nuptial
society
in
the
literary
or
scientific
circle
at
sea
in
friendship
in
the
heaven
of
thought
or
virtue
but
we
have
lingered
long
enough
in
these
painted
courts
the
worth
of
the
thing
signified
must
vindicate
our
taste
for
the
emblem
everything
that
is
called
fashion
and
courtesy
humbles
itself
before
the
cause
and
fountain
of
honor
creator
of
titles
and
dignities
namely
the
heart
of
love
this
is
the
royal
blood
this
the
fire
which
in
all
countries
and
contingencies
will
work
after
its
kind
and
conquer
ind
expand
all
that
approaches
it
this
gives
new
meanings
to
every
fact
this
impoverishes
the
rich
suffering
no
grandeur
but
its
own
what
rich
are
you
rich
enough
to
help
anybody
to
succor
the
unfashionable
and
the
eccentric
rich
enough
to
make
the
canadian
in
his
wagon
the
itinerant
with
his
consul
paper
which
commends
him
to
the
charitable
the
swarthy
italian
with
his
few
broken
words
of
english
the
lame
pauper
hunted
by
overseers
from
town
to
town
even
the
poor
insane
or
besotted
wreck
of
man
or
woman
feel
the
noble
exception
of
your
presence
and
your
house
from
the
general
bleakness
and
stoniness
to
make
such
feel
that
they
were
greeted
with
a
voice
which
made
them
both
remember
and
hope
what
is
vulgar
but
to
refuse
the
claim
on
acute
and
conclusive
reasons
what
is
gentle
but
to
allow
it
and
give
their
heart
and
yours
lone
holiday
from
the
national
caution
without
the
rich
heart
wealth
is
an
ugly
beggar
the
king
of
schiraz
could
not
afford
to
be
so
bountiful
as
the
poor
osman
who
dwelt
at
his
gate
osman
had
a
humanity
so
broad
and
deep
that
although
his
speech
was
so
bold
and
free
with
the
koran
as
to
disgust
all
the
dervishes
yet
was
there
never
a
poor
outcast
eccentric
or
insane
man
some
fool
who
had
cut
off
his
beard
or
who
had
been
mutilated
under
a
vow
or
had
a
pet
madness
in
his
brain
but
fled
at
once
to
him
that
great
heart
lay
there
so
sunny
and
hospitable
in
the
center
of
the
country
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
instinct
of
all
sufferers
drew
them
to
his
side
and
the
madness
which
he
harbored
he
did
not
share
is
not
this
to
be
rich
this
only
to
be
rightly
rich
but
i
shall
hear
without
pain
that
i
play
the
courtier
very
ill
and
talk
of
that
which
i
do
not
well
understand
it
is
easy
to
see
that
what
is
called
by
distinction
society
and
fashion
has
good
laws
as
well
as
bad
has
much
that
is
necessary
and
much
that
is
absurd
too
good
for
banning
and
too
bad
for
blessing
it
reminds
us
of
a
tradition
of
the
pagan
mythology
in
any
attempt
to
settle
its
character
i
overheard
jove
one
day
said
silenus
talking
of
destroying
the
earth
he
said
it
had
failed
they
were
all
rogues
and
vixens
who
went
from
bad
to
worse
as
fast
as
the
days
succeeded
each
other
minerva
said
she
hoped
not
they
were
only
ridiculous
little
creatures
with
this
odd
circumstance
that
they
had
a
blur
or
indeterminate
aspect
seen
far
or
seen
near
if
you
called
them
bad
they
would
appear
so
if
you
called
them
good
they
would
appear
so
and
there
was
no
one
person
or
action
among
them
which
would
not
puzzle
her
owl
much
more
all
olympus
to
know
whether
it
was
fundamentally
bad
or
good
gifts
gifts
of
one
who
loved
me
was
high
time
they
came
when
he
ceased
to
love
me
time
they
stopped
for
shame
it
is
said
that
the
world
is
in
a
state
of
bankruptcy
that
the
world
owes
the
world
more
than
the
world
can
pay
and
ought
to
go
into
chancery
and
be
sold
i
do
not
think
this
general
insolvency
which
involves
in
some
sort
all
the
population
to
be
the
reason
of
the
difficulty
experienced
at
christmas
and
new
year
and
other
times
in
bestowing
gifts
since
it
is
always
so
pleasant
to
be
generous
though
very
vexatious
to
pay
debts
but
the
impediment
lies
in
the
choosing
if
at
any
time
it
comes
into
my
head
that
a
present
is
due
from
me
to
somebody
i
am
puzzled
what
to
give
until
the
opportunity
is
gone
flowers
and
fruits
are
always
fit
presents
flowers
because
they
are
a
proud
assertion
that
a
ray
of
beauty
outvalues
all
the
utilities
of
the
world
these
gay
natures
contrast
with
the
somewhat
stern
countenance
of
ordinary
nature
they
are
like
music
heard
out
of
a
nature
does
not
cocker
us
we
are
children
not
pets
she
is
not
fond
everything
is
dealt
to
us
without
fear
or
favor
after
severe
universal
laws
yet
these
delicate
flowers
look
like
the
frolic
and
interference
of
love
and
beauty
men
use
to
tell
us
that
we
love
flattery
even
though
we
are
not
deceived
by
it
because
it
shows
that
we
are
of
importance
enough
to
be
courted
something
like
that
pleasure
the
flowers
give
us
what
am
i
to
whom
these
sweet
hints
are
addressed
fruits
are
acceptable
gifts
because
they
are
the
flower
of
commodities
and
admit
of
fantastic
values
being
attached
to
them
if
a
man
should
send
to
me
to
come
a
hundred
miles
to
visit
him
and
should
set
before
me
a
basket
of
fine
i
should
think
there
was
some
proportion
between
the
labor
and
the
reward
for
common
gifts
necessity
makes
pertinences
and
beauty
every
day
and
one
is
glad
when
an
imperative
leaves
him
no
option
since
if
the
man
at
the
door
have
no
shoes
you
have
not
to
consider
whether
you
could
procure
him
a
and
as
it
is
always
pleasing
to
see
a
man
eat
bread
or
drink
water
in
the
house
or
out
of
doors
so
it
is
always
a
great
satisfaction
to
supply
these
first
wants
necessity
does
everything
well
in
our
condition
of
universal
dependence
it
seems
heroic
to
let
the
petitioner
be
the
judge
of
his
necessity
and
to
give
all
that
is
asked
though
at
great
inconvenience
if
it
be
a
fantastic
desire
it
is
better
to
leave
to
others
the
office
of
punishing
him
i
can
think
of
many
parts
i
should
prefer
playing
to
that
of
the
furies
next
to
things
of
necessity
the
rule
for
a
gift
which
one
of
my
friends
prescribed
is
that
we
might
convey
to
some
person
that
which
properly
belonged
to
his
character
and
was
easily
associated
with
him
in
thought
but
our
tokens
of
compliment
and
love
are
for
the
most
part
barbarous
rings
and
other
jewels
are
not
gifts
but
apologies
for
gifts
the
only
gift
is
a
portion
of
thyself
thou
must
bleed
for
me
therefore
the
poet
brings
his
poem
the
shepherd
his
lamb
the
farmer
corn
the
miner
a
gem
the
sailor
coral
and
shells
the
painter
his
picture
the
girl
a
handkerchief
of
her
own
sewing
this
is
right
and
pleasing
for
it
restores
society
in
so
far
to
its
primary
basis
when
a
biography
is
conveyed
in
his
gift
and
every
man
wealth
is
an
index
of
his
merit
but
it
is
a
cold
lifeless
business
when
you
go
to
the
shops
to
buy
me
something
which
does
not
represent
your
life
and
talent
but
a
goldsmith
that
is
fit
for
kings
and
rich
men
who
represent
kings
and
a
false
state
of
property
to
make
presents
of
gold
and
silver
stuffs
as
a
kind
of
symbolical
or
payment
of
blackmail
the
law
of
benefits
is
a
difficult
channel
which
requires
careful
sailing
or
rude
boats
it
is
not
the
office
of
a
man
to
receive
gifts
how
dare
you
give
them
we
wish
to
be
we
do
not
quite
forgive
a
forgiver
the
hand
that
feeds
us
is
in
some
danger
of
being
bitten
we
can
receive
anything
from
love
for
that
is
a
way
of
receiving
it
from
ourselves
but
not
from
any
one
who
assumes
to
bestow
we
sometimes
hate
the
meat
which
we
eat
because
there
seems
something
of
degrading
dependence
in
living
by
it
brother
if
jove
to
thee
a
present
make
take
heed
that
from
his
hands
thou
nothing
take
we
ask
the
whole
nothing
less
will
content
us
we
arraign
society
if
it
do
not
give
us
besides
earth
and
fire
and
water
opportunity
love
reverence
and
objects
of
veneration
he
is
a
good
man
who
can
receive
a
gift
well
we
are
either
glad
or
sorry
at
a
gift
and
both
emotions
are
unbecoming
some
violence
i
think
is
done
some
degradation
borne
when
i
rejoice
or
grieve
at
a
gift
i
am
sorry
when
my
independence
is
invaded
or
when
a
gift
comes
from
such
as
do
not
know
my
spirit
and
so
the
act
is
not
supported
and
if
the
gift
pleases
me
overmuch
then
i
should
be
ashamed
that
the
donor
should
read
my
heart
and
see
that
i
love
his
commodity
and
not
him
the
gift
to
be
true
must
be
the
flowing
of
the
giver
unto
me
correspondent
to
my
flowing
unto
him
when
the
waters
are
at
level
then
my
goods
pass
to
him
and
his
to
me
all
his
are
mine
all
mine
his
i
say
to
him
how
can
you
give
me
this
pot
of
oil
or
this
flagon
of
wine
when
all
your
oil
and
wine
is
mine
which
belief
of
mine
this
gift
seems
to
deny
hence
the
fitness
of
beautiful
not
useful
things
for
gifts
this
giving
is
flat
usurpation
and
therefore
when
the
beneficiary
is
ungrateful
as
all
beneficiaries
hate
all
timons
not
at
all
considering
the
value
of
the
gift
but
looking
back
to
the
greater
store
it
was
taken
from
i
rather
sympathize
with
the
beneficiary
than
with
the
anger
of
my
lord
timon
for
the
expectation
of
gratitude
is
mean
and
is
continually
punished
by
the
total
insensibility
of
the
obliged
person
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
get
off
without
injury
and
from
one
who
has
had
the
ill
luck
to
be
served
by
you
it
is
a
very
onerous
business
this
of
being
served
and
the
debtor
naturally
wishes
to
give
you
a
slap
a
golden
text
for
these
gentlemen
is
that
which
i
admire
in
the
buddhist
who
never
thanks
and
who
says
do
not
flatter
your
benefactors
the
reason
of
these
discords
i
conceive
to
be
that
there
is
no
commensurability
between
a
man
and
any
gift
you
can
not
give
anything
to
a
magnanimous
person
after
you
have
served
him
he
at
once
puts
you
in
debt
by
his
magnanimity
the
service
a
man
renders
his
friend
is
trivial
and
selfish
compared
with
the
service
he
knows
his
friend
stood
in
readiness
to
yield
him
alike
before
he
had
begun
to
serve
his
friend
and
now
also
compared
with
that
i
bear
my
friend
the
benefit
it
is
in
my
power
to
render
him
seems
small
besides
our
action
on
each
other
good
as
well
as
evil
is
so
incidental
and
at
random
that
we
can
seldom
hear
the
acknowledgments
of
any
person
who
would
thank
us
for
a
benefit
without
some
shame
and
humiliation
we
can
rarely
strike
a
direct
stroke
but
must
be
content
with
an
oblique
one
we
seldom
have
the
satisfaction
of
yielding
a
direct
benefit
which
is
directly
received
but
rectitude
scatters
favors
on
every
side
without
knowing
it
and
receives
with
wonder
the
thanks
of
all
people
i
fear
to
breathe
any
treason
against
the
majesty
of
love
which
is
the
genius
and
god
of
gifts
and
to
whom
we
must
not
affect
to
prescribe
let
him
give
kingdoms
or
indifferently
there
are
persons
from
whom
we
always
expect
fairy
tokens
let
us
not
cease
to
expect
them
this
is
prerogative
and
not
to
be
limited
by
our
municipal
rules
for
the
rest
i
like
to
see
that
we
can
not
be
bought
and
sold
the
best
of
hospitality
and
of
generosity
is
also
not
in
the
will
but
in
fate
i
find
that
i
am
not
much
to
you
you
do
not
need
me
you
do
not
feel
me
then
am
i
thrust
out
of
doors
though
you
proffer
me
house
and
lands
no
services
are
of
any
value
but
only
likeness
when
i
have
attempted
to
join
myself
to
others
by
services
it
proved
an
intellectual
trick
no
more
they
eat
your
service
like
apples
and
leave
you
out
but
love
them
and
they
feel
for
you
and
delight
in
you
all
the
time
nature
the
rounded
world
is
fair
to
see
nine
times
folded
in
mystery
though
baffled
seers
can
not
impart
the
secret
of
its
laboring
heart
throb
thine
with
nature
throbbing
breast
and
all
is
clear
from
east
to
west
spirit
that
lurks
each
form
within
beckons
to
spirit
of
its
kin
every
atom
glows
and
hints
the
future
which
it
owes
there
are
days
which
occur
in
this
climate
at
almost
any
season
of
the
year
wherein
the
world
reaches
its
perfection
when
the
air
the
heavenly
bodies
and
the
earth
make
a
harmony
as
if
nature
would
indulge
her
offspring
when
in
these
bleak
upper
sides
of
the
planet
nothing
is
to
desire
that
we
have
heard
of
the
happiest
latitudes
and
we
bask
in
the
shining
hours
of
florida
and
cuba
when
everything
that
has
life
gives
sign
of
satisfaction
and
the
cattle
that
lie
on
the
ground
seem
to
have
great
and
tranquil
thoughts
these
halcyons
may
be
looked
for
with
a
little
more
assurance
in
that
pure
october
weather
which
we
distinguish
by
the
name
of
indian
summer
the
day
immeasurably
long
sleeps
over
the
broad
hills
and
warm
wide
fields
to
have
lived
through
all
its
sunny
hours
seems
longevity
enough
the
solitary
places
do
not
seem
quite
lonely
at
the
gates
of
the
forest
the
surprised
man
of
the
world
is
forced
to
leave
his
city
estimates
of
great
and
small
wise
and
foolish
the
knapsack
of
custom
falls
off
his
back
with
the
first
step
he
makes
into
these
precincts
here
is
sanctity
which
shames
our
religions
and
reality
which
discredits
our
heroes
here
we
find
nature
to
be
the
circumstance
which
dwarfs
every
other
circumstance
and
judges
like
a
god
all
men
that
come
to
her
we
have
crept
out
of
our
close
and
crowded
houses
into
the
night
and
morning
and
we
see
what
majestic
beauties
daily
wrap
us
in
their
bosom
how
willingly
we
would
escape
the
barriers
which
render
them
comparatively
impotent
escape
the
sophistication
and
second
thought
and
suffer
nature
to
entrance
us
the
tempered
light
of
the
woods
is
like
a
perpetual
morning
and
is
stimulating
and
heroic
the
anciently
reported
spells
of
these
places
creep
on
us
the
stems
of
pines
hemlocks
and
oaks
almost
gleam
like
iron
on
the
excited
eye
the
incommunicable
trees
begin
to
persuade
us
to
live
with
them
and
quit
our
life
of
solemn
trifles
here
no
history
or
church
or
state
is
interpolated
on
the
divine
sky
and
the
immortal
year
how
easily
we
might
walk
onward
into
opening
landscape
absorbed
by
new
pictures
and
by
thoughts
fast
succeeding
each
other
until
by
degrees
the
recollection
of
home
was
crowded
out
of
the
mind
all
memory
obliterated
by
the
tyranny
of
the
present
and
we
were
led
in
triumph
by
nature
these
enchantments
are
medicinal
they
sober
and
heal
us
these
are
plain
pleasures
kindly
and
native
to
us
we
come
to
our
own
and
make
friends
with
matter
which
the
ambitious
chatter
of
the
schools
would
persuade
us
to
despise
we
never
can
part
with
it
the
mind
loves
its
old
home
as
water
to
our
thirst
so
is
the
rock
the
ground
to
our
eyes
and
hands
and
feet
it
is
firm
water
it
is
cold
flame
what
health
what
affinity
ever
an
old
friend
ever
like
a
dear
friend
and
brother
when
we
chat
affectedly
with
strangers
comes
in
this
honest
face
and
takes
a
grave
liberty
with
us
and
shames
us
out
of
our
nonsense
cities
give
not
the
human
senses
room
enough
we
go
out
daily
and
nightly
to
feed
the
eyes
on
the
horizon
and
require
so
much
scope
just
as
we
need
water
for
our
bath
there
are
all
degrees
of
natural
influence
from
these
quarantine
powers
of
nature
up
to
her
dearest
and
gravest
ministrations
to
the
imagination
and
the
soul
there
is
the
bucket
of
cold
water
from
the
spring
the
to
which
the
chilled
traveler
rushes
for
safety
and
there
is
the
sublime
moral
of
autumn
and
of
noon
we
nestle
in
nature
and
draw
our
living
as
parasites
from
her
roots
and
grains
and
we
receive
glances
from
the
heavenly
bodies
which
call
us
to
solitude
and
foretell
the
remotest
future
the
blue
zenith
is
the
point
in
which
romance
and
reality
meet
i
think
if
we
should
be
rapt
away
into
all
that
we
dream
of
heaven
and
should
converse
with
gabriel
and
uriel
the
upper
sky
would
be
all
that
would
remain
of
our
furniture
it
seems
as
if
the
day
was
not
wholly
profane
in
which
we
have
given
heed
to
some
natural
object
the
fall
of
snowflakes
in
a
still
air
preserving
to
each
crystal
its
perfect
form
the
blowing
of
sleet
over
a
wide
sheet
of
water
and
over
plains
the
waving
the
mimic
waving
of
acres
of
houstonia
whose
innumerable
florets
whiten
and
ripple
before
the
eye
the
reflections
of
trees
and
flowers
in
glassy
lakes
the
musical
steaming
odorous
south
wind
which
converts
all
trees
to
the
crackling
and
spurting
of
hemlock
in
the
flames
or
of
which
yield
glory
to
the
walls
and
faces
in
the
these
are
the
music
and
pictures
of
the
most
ancient
religion
my
house
stands
in
low
land
with
limited
outlook
and
on
the
skirt
of
the
village
but
i
go
with
my
friend
to
the
shore
of
our
little
river
and
with
one
stroke
of
the
paddle
i
leave
the
village
politics
and
personalities
yes
and
the
world
of
villages
and
personalities
behind
and
pass
into
a
delicate
realm
of
sunset
and
moonlight
too
bright
almost
for
spotted
man
to
enter
without
novitiate
and
probation
we
penetrate
bodily
this
incredible
beauty
we
dip
our
hands
in
this
painted
element
our
eyes
are
bathed
in
these
lights
and
forms
a
holiday
a
villeggiatura
a
royal
revel
the
proudest
most
festival
that
valor
and
beauty
power
and
taste
ever
decked
and
enjoyed
establishes
itself
on
the
instant
these
sunset
clouds
these
delicately
emerging
stars
with
their
private
and
ineffable
glances
signify
it
and
proffer
it
i
am
taught
the
poorness
of
our
invention
the
ugliness
of
towns
and
palaces
art
and
luxury
have
early
learned
that
they
must
work
as
enhancement
and
sequel
to
this
original
beauty
i
am
overinstructed
for
my
return
henceforth
i
shall
be
hard
to
please
i
can
not
go
back
to
toys
i
am
grown
expensive
and
sophisticated
i
can
no
longer
live
without
elegance
but
a
countryman
shall
be
my
master
of
revels
he
who
knows
the
most
he
who
knows
what
sweets
and
virtues
are
in
the
ground
the
waters
the
plants
the
heavens
and
how
to
come
at
these
enchantments
is
the
rich
and
royal
man
only
as
far
as
masters
of
the
world
have
called
in
nature
to
their
aid
can
they
reach
the
height
of
magnificence
this
is
the
meaning
of
their
villas
islands
parks
and
preserves
to
back
their
faulty
personality
with
these
strong
accessories
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
landed
interest
should
be
invincible
in
the
state
with
these
dangerous
auxiliaries
these
bribe
and
invite
not
kings
not
palaces
not
men
not
women
but
these
tender
and
poetic
stars
eloquent
of
secret
promises
we
heard
what
the
rich
man
said
we
knew
of
his
villa
his
grove
his
wine
and
his
company
but
the
provocation
and
point
of
the
invitation
came
out
of
these
beguiling
stars
in
their
soft
glances
i
see
what
men
strove
to
realize
in
some
versailles
or
paphos
or
ctesiphon
indeed
it
is
the
magical
lights
of
the
horizon
and
the
blue
sky
for
the
background
which
save
all
our
works
of
art
which
were
otherwise
baubles
when
the
rich
tax
the
poor
with
servility
and
obsequiousness
they
should
consider
the
effect
of
man
reputed
to
be
the
possessors
of
nature
on
imaginative
minds
ah
if
the
rich
were
rich
as
the
poor
fancy
riches
a
boy
hears
a
military
band
play
on
the
field
at
night
and
he
has
kings
and
queens
and
famous
chivalry
palpably
before
him
he
hears
the
echoes
of
a
horn
in
a
hill
country
in
the
notch
mountains
for
example
which
converts
the
mountains
into
an
æolian
harp
and
this
supernatural
restores
to
him
the
dorian
mythology
apollo
diana
and
all
divine
hunters
and
huntresses
can
a
musical
note
be
so
lofty
so
haughtily
beautiful
to
the
poor
young
poet
thus
fabulous
is
his
picture
of
society
he
is
loyal
he
respects
the
rich
they
are
rich
for
the
sake
of
his
imagination
how
poor
his
fancy
would
be
if
they
were
not
rich
that
they
have
some
grove
which
they
call
a
park
that
they
live
in
larger
and
saloons
than
he
has
visited
and
go
in
coaches
keeping
only
the
society
of
the
elegant
to
and
to
distant
cities
are
the
groundwork
from
which
he
has
delineated
estates
of
romance
compared
with
which
their
actual
possessions
are
shanties
and
paddocks
the
muse
herself
betrays
her
son
and
enhances
the
gift
of
wealthy
and
beauty
by
a
radiation
out
of
the
air
and
clouds
and
forests
that
skirt
the
road
a
certain
haughty
favor
as
if
from
patrician
genii
to
patricians
a
kind
of
aristocracy
in
nature
a
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
moral
sensibility
which
makes
edens
and
tempes
so
easily
may
not
be
always
found
but
the
material
landscape
is
never
far
off
we
can
find
these
enchantments
without
visiting
the
como
lake
or
the
madeira
islands
we
exaggerate
the
praises
of
local
scenery
in
every
landscape
the
point
of
astonishment
is
the
meeting
of
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
that
is
seen
from
the
first
hillock
as
well
as
from
the
top
of
the
alleghanies
the
stars
at
night
stoop
down
over
the
brownest
homeliest
common
with
all
the
spiritual
magnificence
which
they
shed
on
the
campagna
or
on
the
marble
deserts
of
egypt
the
uprolled
clouds
and
the
colors
of
morning
and
evening
will
transfigure
maples
and
alders
the
difference
between
landscape
and
landscape
is
small
but
there
is
great
difference
in
the
beholders
there
is
nothing
so
wonderful
in
any
particular
landscape
as
the
necessity
of
being
beautiful
under
which
every
landscape
lies
nature
can
not
be
surprised
in
undress
beauty
breaks
in
everywhere
but
it
is
very
easy
to
outrun
the
sympathy
of
readers
on
this
topic
which
called
or
nature
passive
one
can
hardly
speak
directly
of
it
without
excess
it
is
as
easy
to
broach
in
mixed
companies
what
is
called
the
subject
of
religion
a
susceptible
person
does
not
like
to
indulge
his
tastes
in
this
kind
without
the
apology
of
some
trivial
necessity
he
goes
to
see
a
or
to
look
at
the
crops
or
to
fetch
a
plant
or
a
mineral
from
a
remote
locality
or
he
carries
a
or
a
i
suppose
this
shame
must
have
a
good
reason
a
dilettantism
in
nature
is
barren
and
unworthy
the
fop
of
fields
is
no
better
than
his
brother
of
broadway
men
are
naturally
hunters
and
inquisitive
of
woodcraft
and
i
suppose
that
such
a
gazetteer
as
and
indians
should
furnish
facts
for
would
take
place
in
the
most
sumptuous
of
all
the
wreaths
and
chaplets
of
the
yet
ordinarily
whether
we
are
too
clumsy
for
so
subtle
a
topic
or
from
whatever
cause
as
soon
as
men
begin
to
write
on
nature
they
fall
into
euphuism
frivolity
is
a
most
unfit
tribute
to
pan
who
ought
to
be
represented
in
the
mythology
as
the
most
continent
of
gods
i
would
not
be
frivolous
before
the
admirable
reserve
and
prudence
of
time
yet
i
can
not
renounce
the
right
of
returning
often
to
this
old
topic
the
multitude
of
false
churches
accredits
the
true
religion
literature
poetry
science
are
the
homage
of
man
to
this
unfathomed
secret
concerning
which
no
sane
man
can
affect
an
indifference
or
incuriosity
nature
is
loved
by
what
is
best
in
us
it
is
loved
as
the
city
of
god
although
or
rather
because
there
is
no
citizen
the
sunset
is
unlike
anything
that
is
underneath
it
it
wants
men
and
the
beauty
of
nature
must
always
seem
unreal
and
mocking
until
the
landscape
has
human
figures
that
are
as
good
as
itself
if
there
were
good
men
there
would
never
be
this
rapture
in
nature
if
the
king
is
in
the
palace
nobody
looks
at
the
walls
it
is
when
he
is
gone
and
the
house
is
filled
with
grooms
and
gazers
that
we
turn
from
the
people
to
find
relief
in
the
majestic
men
that
are
suggested
by
the
pictures
and
architecture
the
critics
who
complain
of
the
sickly
separation
of
the
beauty
of
nature
from
the
thing
to
be
done
must
consider
that
our
hunting
of
the
picturesque
is
inseparable
from
our
protest
against
false
society
man
is
fallen
nature
is
erect
and
serves
as
a
differential
thermometer
detecting
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
divine
sentiment
in
man
by
fault
of
our
dulness
and
selfishness
we
are
looking
up
to
nature
but
when
we
are
convalescent
nature
will
look
up
to
us
we
see
the
foaming
brook
with
compunction
if
our
own
life
flowed
with
the
right
energy
we
should
shame
the
brook
the
stream
of
zeal
sparkles
with
real
fire
and
not
with
reflex
rays
of
sun
and
moon
nature
may
be
as
selfishly
studied
as
trade
astronomy
to
the
selfish
becomes
astrology
psychology
mesmerism
with
intent
to
show
where
our
spoons
are
gone
and
anatomy
and
physiology
become
phrenology
and
palmistry
but
taking
timely
warning
and
leaving
many
things
unsaid
on
this
topic
but
not
longer
omit
our
homage
to
the
efficient
nature
the
quick
cause
before
which
all
forms
flee
as
the
driven
snows
itself
secret
its
works
driven
before
it
in
flocks
and
multitudes
as
the
ancient
represented
nature
by
proteus
a
shepherd
and
in
undescribable
variety
it
publishes
itself
in
creatures
reaching
from
particles
and
spicula
through
transformation
on
transformation
to
the
highest
symmetries
arriving
at
consummate
results
without
a
shock
or
a
leap
a
little
heat
that
is
a
little
motion
is
all
that
differences
the
bald
dazzling
white
and
deadly
cold
poles
of
the
earth
from
the
prolific
tropical
climates
all
changes
pass
without
violence
by
reason
of
the
two
cardinal
conditions
of
boundless
space
and
boundless
time
geology
has
initiated
us
into
the
secularity
of
nature
and
taught
us
to
disuse
our
measures
and
exchange
our
mosaic
and
ptolemaic
schemes
for
her
large
style
we
know
nothing
rightly
for
want
of
perspective
now
we
learn
what
patient
periods
must
round
themselves
before
the
rock
is
formed
then
before
the
rock
is
broken
and
the
first
lichen
race
has
disintegrated
the
thinnest
external
plate
into
soil
and
opened
the
door
for
the
remote
flora
fauna
ceres
and
pomona
to
come
in
how
far
off
yet
is
the
trilobite
how
far
the
quadruped
how
inconceivably
remote
is
man
all
duly
arrive
and
then
race
after
race
of
men
it
is
a
long
way
from
granite
to
the
oyster
farther
yet
to
plato
and
the
preaching
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
yet
all
must
come
as
surely
as
the
first
atom
has
two
sides
motion
or
change
and
identity
or
rest
are
the
first
and
second
secrets
of
nature
motion
and
rest
the
whole
code
of
her
laws
may
be
written
on
the
or
the
signet
of
a
ring
the
whirling
bubble
on
the
surface
of
a
brook
admits
us
to
the
secret
of
the
mechanics
of
the
sky
every
shell
on
the
beach
is
a
key
to
it
a
little
water
made
to
rotate
in
a
cup
explains
the
formation
of
the
simpler
shells
the
addition
of
matter
from
year
to
year
arrives
at
last
at
the
most
complex
forms
and
yet
so
poor
is
nature
with
all
her
craft
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
universe
she
has
but
one
stuff
but
one
stuff
with
its
two
ends
to
serve
up
all
her
variety
compound
it
how
she
will
star
sand
fire
water
tree
man
it
is
still
one
stuff
and
betrays
the
same
properties
nature
is
always
consistent
though
she
feigns
to
contravene
her
own
laws
she
keeps
her
laws
and
seems
to
transcend
them
she
arms
and
equips
an
animal
to
find
its
place
and
living
in
the
earth
and
at
the
same
time
she
arms
and
equips
another
animal
to
destroy
it
space
exists
to
divide
creatures
but
by
clothing
the
sides
of
a
bird
with
a
few
feathers
she
gives
him
a
petty
omnipresence
the
direction
is
forever
onward
but
the
artist
still
goes
back
for
materials
and
begins
again
with
the
first
elements
on
the
most
advanced
stage
otherwise
all
goes
to
ruin
if
we
look
at
her
work
we
seem
to
catch
a
glance
of
a
system
in
transition
plants
are
the
young
of
the
world
vessels
of
health
and
vigor
but
they
grope
ever
upward
toward
consciousness
the
trees
are
imperfect
men
and
seem
to
bemoan
their
imprisonment
rooted
in
the
ground
the
animal
is
the
novice
and
probationer
of
a
more
advanced
order
the
men
though
young
having
tasted
the
first
drop
from
the
cup
of
thought
are
already
dissipated
the
maples
and
ferns
are
still
uncorrupt
yet
no
doubt
when
they
come
to
consciousness
they
too
will
curse
and
swear
flowers
so
strictly
belong
to
youth
that
we
adult
men
soon
come
to
feel
that
their
beautiful
generations
concern
not
us
we
have
had
our
day
now
let
the
children
have
theirs
the
flowers
jilt
us
and
we
are
old
bachelors
with
our
ridiculous
tenderness
things
are
so
strictly
related
that
according
to
the
skill
of
the
eye
from
any
one
object
the
parts
and
properties
of
any
other
may
be
predicted
if
we
had
eyes
to
see
it
a
bit
of
stone
from
the
city
wall
would
certify
us
of
the
necessity
that
man
must
exist
as
readily
as
the
city
that
identity
makes
us
all
one
and
reduces
to
nothing
great
intervals
on
our
customary
scale
we
talk
of
deviations
from
natural
life
as
if
artificial
life
were
not
also
natural
the
smoothest
curled
courtier
in
the
boudoirs
of
a
palace
has
an
animal
nature
rude
and
aboriginal
as
a
white
bear
omnipotent
to
its
own
ends
and
is
directly
related
there
amid
essences
and
to
himalaya
and
the
axis
of
the
globe
if
we
consider
how
much
we
are
nature
we
need
not
be
superstitious
about
towns
as
if
that
terrific
or
benefic
force
did
not
find
us
there
also
and
fashion
cities
nature
who
made
the
mason
made
the
house
we
may
easily
hear
too
much
of
rural
influences
the
cool
disengaged
air
of
natural
objects
makes
them
enviable
to
us
chafed
and
irritable
creatures
with
red
faces
and
we
think
we
shall
be
as
grand
as
they
if
we
camp
out
and
eat
roots
but
let
us
be
men
instead
of
and
the
oak
and
the
elm
shall
gladly
serve
us
though
we
sit
in
chairs
of
ivory
on
carpets
of
silk
this
guiding
identity
runs
through
all
the
surprises
and
contrasts
of
the
piece
and
characterizes
every
law
man
carries
the
world
in
his
head
the
whole
astronomy
and
chemistry
suspended
in
a
thought
because
the
history
of
nature
is
charactered
in
his
brain
therefore
is
he
the
prophet
and
discoverer
of
her
secrets
every
known
fact
in
natural
science
was
divined
by
the
presentiment
of
somebody
before
it
was
actually
verified
a
man
does
not
tie
his
shoe
without
recognizing
laws
which
bind
the
farthest
regions
of
nature
moon
plant
gas
crystal
are
concrete
geometry
and
numbers
common
sense
knows
its
own
and
recognizes
the
fact
at
first
sight
in
chemical
experiment
the
common
sense
of
franklin
dalton
davy
and
black
is
the
same
common
sense
which
made
the
arrangements
which
now
it
discovers
if
the
identity
expresses
organized
rest
the
counter
action
runs
also
into
organization
the
astronomers
said
give
us
matter
and
a
little
motion
and
we
will
construct
the
universe
it
is
not
enough
that
we
should
have
matter
we
must
also
have
a
single
impulse
one
shove
to
launch
the
mass
and
generate
the
harmony
of
the
centrifugal
and
centripetal
forces
once
heave
the
ball
from
the
hand
and
we
can
show
how
all
this
mighty
order
grew
a
very
unreasonable
postulate
said
the
metaphysicians
and
a
plain
begging
of
the
question
could
you
not
prevail
to
know
the
genesis
of
projection
as
well
as
the
continuation
of
it
nature
meanwhile
had
not
waited
for
the
discussion
but
right
or
wrong
bestowed
the
impulse
and
the
balls
rolled
it
was
no
great
affair
a
mere
push
but
the
astronomers
were
right
in
making
much
of
it
for
there
is
no
end
of
the
consequences
of
the
act
that
famous
aboriginal
push
propagates
itself
through
all
the
balls
of
the
system
and
through
every
atom
of
every
ball
through
all
the
races
of
creatures
and
through
the
history
and
performances
of
every
individual
exaggeration
is
in
the
course
of
things
nature
sends
no
creature
no
man
into
the
world
without
adding
a
small
excess
of
his
proper
quality
given
the
planet
it
is
still
necessary
to
add
the
impulse
so
to
every
creature
nature
added
a
little
violence
of
direction
in
its
proper
path
a
shove
to
put
it
on
its
way
in
every
instance
a
slight
generosity
a
drop
too
much
without
electricity
the
air
would
rot
and
without
this
violence
of
direction
which
men
and
women
have
without
a
spice
of
bigot
and
fanatic
no
excitement
no
efficiency
we
aim
above
the
mark
to
hit
the
mark
every
act
hath
some
falsehood
of
exaggeration
in
it
and
when
now
and
then
comes
along
some
sad
man
who
sees
how
paltry
a
game
is
played
and
refuses
to
play
but
blabs
the
secret
how
then
is
the
bird
flown
o
no
the
wary
nature
sends
a
new
troop
of
fairer
forms
of
lordlier
youths
with
a
little
more
excess
of
direction
to
hold
them
fast
to
their
several
aims
makes
them
a
little
wrongheaded
in
that
direction
in
which
they
are
rightest
and
on
goes
the
game
again
with
new
whirl
for
a
generation
or
two
more
the
child
with
his
sweet
pranks
the
fool
of
his
senses
commanded
by
every
sight
and
sound
without
any
power
to
compare
and
rank
his
sensations
abandoned
to
a
whistle
or
a
painted
chip
to
a
lead
dragoon
or
a
dog
individualizing
everything
generalizing
nothing
delighted
with
every
new
thing
lies
down
at
night
overpowered
by
the
fatigue
which
this
day
of
continual
petty
madness
has
incurred
but
nature
has
answered
her
purpose
with
the
curly
dimpled
lunatic
she
has
tasked
every
faculty
and
has
secured
the
symmetrical
growth
of
the
bodily
frame
by
all
these
attitudes
and
exertions
an
end
of
the
first
importance
which
could
not
be
trusted
to
any
care
less
perfect
than
her
own
this
glitter
this
opaline
luster
plays
round
the
top
of
every
toy
to
his
eye
to
insure
his
fidelity
and
he
is
deceived
to
his
good
we
are
made
alive
and
kept
alive
by
the
same
arts
let
the
stoics
say
what
they
please
we
do
not
eat
for
the
good
of
living
but
because
the
meat
is
savory
and
the
appetite
is
keen
the
vegetable
life
does
not
content
itself
with
casting
from
the
flower
or
the
tree
a
single
seed
but
it
fills
the
air
and
earth
with
a
prodigality
of
seeds
that
if
thousands
perish
thousands
may
plant
themselves
that
hundreds
may
come
up
that
tens
may
live
to
maturity
that
at
least
one
may
replace
the
parent
all
things
betray
the
same
calculated
profusion
the
excess
of
fear
with
which
the
animal
frame
is
hedged
round
shrinking
from
cold
starting
at
sight
of
a
snake
or
a
sudden
noise
protects
us
through
a
multitude
of
groundless
alarms
from
some
one
real
danger
at
last
the
lover
seeks
in
marriage
his
private
felicity
and
perfection
with
no
prospective
end
and
nature
hides
in
his
happiness
her
own
end
namely
progeny
or
the
perpetuity
of
the
race
but
the
craft
with
which
the
world
is
made
runs
also
into
the
mind
and
character
of
men
no
man
is
quite
sane
each
has
a
vein
of
folly
in
his
composition
a
slight
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
to
make
sure
of
holding
him
hard
to
some
one
point
which
nature
had
taken
to
heart
great
causes
are
never
tried
on
their
merits
but
the
cause
is
reduced
to
particulars
to
suit
the
size
of
the
partisans
and
the
contention
is
ever
hottest
on
minor
matters
not
less
remarkable
is
the
overfaith
of
each
man
in
the
importance
of
what
he
has
to
do
or
say
the
poet
the
prophet
has
a
higher
value
for
what
he
utters
than
any
hearer
and
therefore
it
gets
spoken
the
strong
luther
declares
with
an
emphasis
not
to
be
mistaken
that
god
himself
can
not
do
without
wise
men
jacob
behmen
and
george
fox
betray
their
egotism
in
the
pertinacity
of
their
controversial
tracts
and
james
naylor
once
suffered
himself
to
be
worshiped
as
the
christ
each
prophet
comes
presently
to
identify
himself
with
his
thought
and
to
esteem
his
hat
and
shoes
sacred
however
this
may
discredit
such
persons
with
the
judicious
it
helps
them
with
the
people
as
it
gives
heat
pungency
and
publicity
to
their
words
a
similar
experience
is
not
infrequent
in
private
life
each
young
and
ardent
person
writes
a
diary
in
which
when
the
hours
of
prayer
and
penitence
arrive
he
inscribes
his
soul
the
pages
thus
written
are
to
him
burning
and
fragrant
he
reads
them
on
his
knees
by
midnight
and
by
the
morning
star
he
wets
them
with
his
tears
they
are
sacred
too
good
for
the
world
and
hardly
yet
to
be
shown
to
the
dearest
friend
this
is
the
that
is
born
to
the
soul
and
her
life
still
circulates
in
the
babe
the
umbilical
cord
has
not
yet
been
cut
after
some
time
has
elapsed
he
begins
to
wish
to
admit
his
friend
to
this
hallowed
experience
and
with
hesitation
yet
with
firmness
exposes
the
pages
to
his
eye
will
they
not
burn
his
eyes
the
friend
coldly
turns
them
over
and
passes
from
the
writing
to
conversation
with
easy
transition
which
strikes
the
other
party
with
astonishment
and
vexation
he
can
not
suspect
the
writing
itself
days
and
nights
of
fervid
life
of
communion
with
angels
of
darkness
and
of
light
have
engraved
their
shadowy
characters
on
that
book
he
suspects
the
intelligence
or
the
heart
of
his
friend
is
there
then
no
friend
he
can
not
yet
credit
that
one
may
have
impressive
experience
and
yet
may
not
know
how
to
put
his
private
fact
into
literature
and
perhaps
the
discovery
that
wisdom
has
other
tongues
and
ministers
than
we
that
though
we
should
hold
our
peace
the
truth
would
not
the
less
be
spoken
might
check
injuriously
the
flames
of
our
zeal
a
man
can
only
speak
so
long
as
he
does
not
feel
his
speech
to
be
partial
and
inadequate
it
is
partial
but
he
does
not
see
it
to
be
so
whilst
he
utters
it
as
soon
as
he
is
released
from
the
instinctive
and
particular
and
sees
its
partiality
he
shuts
his
mouth
in
disgust
for
no
man
can
write
anything
who
does
not
think
that
what
he
writes
is
for
the
time
the
history
of
the
world
or
do
anything
well
who
does
not
esteem
his
work
to
be
of
importance
my
work
may
be
of
none
but
i
must
not
think
it
is
of
none
or
i
shall
not
do
it
with
impunity
in
like
manner
there
is
throughout
nature
something
mocking
something
that
leads
us
on
and
on
but
arrives
nowhere
keeps
no
faith
with
us
all
promise
outruns
the
performance
we
live
in
a
system
of
approximations
every
end
is
prospective
of
some
other
end
which
is
also
temporary
a
round
and
final
success
nowhere
we
are
encamped
in
nature
not
domesticated
hunger
and
thirst
lead
us
on
to
eat
and
to
drink
but
bread
and
wine
mix
and
cook
them
how
you
will
leave
us
hungry
and
thirsty
after
the
stomach
is
full
it
is
the
same
with
all
our
arts
and
performances
our
music
our
poetry
our
language
itself
are
not
satisfactions
but
suggestions
the
hunger
for
wealth
which
reduces
the
planet
to
a
garden
fools
the
eager
pursuer
what
is
the
end
sought
plainly
to
secure
the
ends
of
good
sense
and
beauty
from
the
intrusion
of
deformity
or
vulgarity
of
any
kind
but
what
an
operose
method
what
a
train
of
means
to
secure
a
little
conversation
this
palace
of
brick
and
stone
these
servants
this
kitchen
these
stables
horses
and
equipage
this
and
file
of
mortgages
trade
to
all
the
world
and
cottage
by
the
all
for
a
little
conversation
high
clear
and
spiritual
could
it
not
be
had
as
well
by
beggars
on
the
highway
no
all
these
things
came
from
successive
efforts
of
these
beggars
to
remove
friction
from
the
wheels
of
life
and
give
opportunity
conversation
character
were
the
avowed
ends
wealth
was
good
as
it
appeased
the
animal
cravings
cured
the
smoky
chimney
silenced
the
creaking
door
brought
friends
together
in
a
warm
and
quiet
room
and
kept
the
children
and
the
in
a
different
apartment
thought
virtue
beauty
were
the
ends
but
it
was
known
that
men
of
thought
and
virtue
sometimes
had
the
headache
or
wet
feet
or
could
lose
good
time
whilst
the
room
was
getting
warm
in
winter
days
unluckily
in
the
exertions
necessary
to
remove
these
inconveniences
the
main
attention
has
been
diverted
to
this
object
the
old
aims
have
been
lost
sight
of
and
to
remove
friction
has
come
to
be
the
end
that
is
the
ridicule
of
rich
men
and
boston
london
vienna
and
now
the
governments
generally
of
the
world
are
cities
and
governments
of
the
rich
and
the
masses
are
not
men
but
that
is
men
who
would
be
rich
this
is
the
ridicule
of
the
class
that
they
arrive
with
pains
and
sweat
and
fury
nowhere
when
all
is
done
it
is
for
nothing
they
are
like
one
who
has
interrupted
the
conversation
of
a
company
to
make
his
speech
and
now
has
forgotten
what
he
went
to
say
the
appearance
strikes
the
eye
everywhere
of
an
aimless
society
of
aimless
nations
were
the
ends
of
nature
so
great
and
cogent
as
to
exact
this
immense
sacrifice
of
men
quite
analogous
to
the
deceits
in
life
there
is
as
might
be
expected
a
similar
effect
on
the
eye
from
the
face
of
external
nature
there
is
in
woods
and
waters
a
certain
enticement
and
flattery
together
with
a
failure
to
yield
a
present
satisfaction
this
disappointment
is
felt
in
every
landscape
i
have
seen
the
softness
and
beauty
of
the
summer
clouds
floating
feathery
overhead
enjoying
as
it
seemed
their
height
and
privilege
of
motion
whilst
yet
they
appeared
not
so
much
the
drapery
of
this
place
and
hour
as
to
such
pavilions
and
gardens
of
festivity
beyond
it
is
an
odd
jealousy
but
the
poet
finds
himself
not
near
enough
to
this
object
the
pine
tree
the
river
the
bank
of
flowers
before
him
does
not
seem
to
be
nature
nature
is
still
elsewhere
this
or
this
is
but
outskirt
and
reflection
and
echo
of
the
triumph
that
has
passed
by
and
is
now
at
its
glancing
splendor
and
heyday
perchance
in
the
neighboring
fields
or
if
you
stand
in
the
field
then
in
the
adjacent
woods
the
present
object
shall
give
you
this
sense
of
stillness
that
follows
a
pageant
which
has
just
gone
by
what
splendid
distance
what
recesses
of
ineffable
pomp
and
loveliness
in
the
sunset
but
who
can
go
where
they
are
or
lay
his
hand
or
plant
his
foot
thereon
off
they
fall
from
the
round
world
forever
and
ever
it
is
the
same
among
men
and
women
as
among
the
silent
trees
always
a
referred
existence
an
absence
never
a
presence
and
satisfaction
is
it
that
beauty
can
never
be
grasped
in
persons
and
in
landscapes
is
equally
inaccessible
the
accepted
and
betrothed
lover
has
lost
the
wildest
charm
of
his
maiden
in
her
acceptance
of
him
she
was
heaven
whilst
he
pursued
her
as
a
star
she
can
not
be
heaven
if
she
stoops
to
such
a
one
as
he
what
shall
we
say
of
this
omnipresent
appearance
of
that
first
projectile
impulse
of
this
flattery
and
balking
of
so
many
creatures
must
we
not
suppose
somewhere
in
the
universe
a
slight
treachery
and
derision
are
we
not
engaged
to
a
serious
resentment
of
this
use
that
is
made
of
us
are
we
tickled
trout
and
fools
of
nature
one
looks
at
the
face
of
heaven
and
earth
lays
all
petulance
at
rest
and
soothes
us
to
wiser
convictions
to
the
intelligent
nature
converts
itself
into
a
vast
promise
and
will
not
be
rashly
explained
her
secret
is
untold
many
and
many
an
oedipus
arrives
he
has
the
whole
mystery
teeming
in
his
brain
alas
the
same
sorcery
has
spoiled
his
skill
no
syllable
can
he
shape
on
his
lips
her
mighty
orbit
vaults
like
the
fresh
rainbow
into
the
deep
but
no
archangel
wing
was
yet
strong
enough
to
follow
it
and
report
of
the
return
of
the
curve
but
it
also
appears
that
our
actions
are
seconded
and
disposed
to
greater
conclusions
than
we
designed
we
are
escorted
on
every
hand
through
life
by
spiritual
agents
and
a
beneficent
purpose
lies
in
wait
for
us
we
can
not
bandy
words
with
nature
or
deal
with
her
as
we
deal
with
persons
if
we
measure
our
individual
forces
against
hers
we
may
easily
feel
as
if
we
were
the
sport
of
an
insuperable
destiny
but
if
instead
of
identifying
ourselves
with
the
work
we
feel
that
the
soul
of
the
workman
streams
through
us
we
shall
find
the
peace
of
the
morning
dwelling
first
in
our
hearts
and
the
fathomless
powers
of
gravity
and
chemistry
and
over
them
of
life
preëxisting
within
us
in
their
highest
form
the
uneasiness
which
the
thought
of
our
helplessness
in
the
chain
of
causes
occasions
us
results
from
looking
too
much
at
one
condition
of
nature
namely
motion
but
the
drag
is
never
taken
from
the
wheel
wherever
the
impulse
exceeds
the
rest
or
identity
insinuates
its
compensation
all
over
the
wide
fields
of
earth
grows
the
prunella
or
after
every
foolish
day
we
sleep
off
the
fumes
and
furies
of
its
hours
and
though
we
are
always
engaged
with
particulars
and
often
enslaved
to
them
we
bring
with
us
to
every
experiment
the
innate
universal
laws
these
while
they
exist
in
the
mind
as
ideas
stand
around
us
in
nature
forever
embodied
a
present
sanity
to
expose
and
cure
the
insanity
of
men
our
servitude
to
particulars
betrays
us
into
a
hundred
foolish
expectations
we
anticipate
a
new
era
from
the
invention
of
a
locomotive
or
a
balloon
the
new
engine
brings
with
it
the
old
checks
they
say
that
by
your
salad
shall
be
grown
from
the
seed
whilst
your
fowl
is
roasting
for
dinner
it
is
a
symbol
of
our
modern
aims
and
endeavors
of
our
condensation
and
acceleration
of
objects
but
nothing
is
gained
nature
can
not
be
cheated
man
life
is
but
seventy
salads
long
grow
they
swift
or
grow
they
slow
in
these
checks
and
impossibilities
however
we
find
our
advantage
not
less
than
in
impulses
let
the
victory
fall
where
it
will
we
are
on
that
side
and
the
knowledge
that
we
traverse
the
whole
scale
of
being
from
the
center
to
the
poles
of
nature
and
have
some
stake
in
every
possibility
lends
that
sublime
luster
to
death
which
philosophy
and
religion
have
too
outwardly
and
literally
striven
to
express
in
the
popular
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
reality
is
more
excellent
than
the
report
here
is
no
ruin
no
discontinuity
no
spent
ball
the
divine
circulations
never
rest
nor
linger
nature
is
the
incarnation
of
a
thought
and
turns
to
a
thought
again
as
ice
becomes
water
and
gas
the
world
is
mind
precipitated
and
the
volatile
essence
is
forever
escaping
again
into
the
state
of
free
thought
hence
the
virtue
and
pungency
of
the
influence
on
the
mind
of
natural
objects
whether
inorganic
or
organized
man
imprisoned
man
crystallized
man
vegetative
speaks
to
man
impersonated
that
power
which
does
not
respect
quantity
which
makes
the
whole
and
the
particle
its
equal
channel
delegates
its
smile
to
the
morning
and
distills
its
essence
into
every
drop
of
rain
every
moment
instructs
and
every
object
for
wisdom
is
infused
into
every
form
it
has
been
poured
into
us
as
blood
it
convulsed
us
as
pain
it
slid
into
us
as
pleasure
it
enveloped
us
in
dull
melancholy
days
or
in
days
of
cheerful
labor
we
did
not
guess
its
essence
until
after
a
long
time
shakspeare
or
the
poet
transcriber
note
shakspeare
is
spelled
as
shakspeare
as
well
as
shakespeare
in
this
book
the
original
spellings
have
been
retained
great
men
are
more
distinguished
by
range
and
extent
than
by
originality
if
we
require
the
originality
which
consists
in
weaving
like
a
spider
their
web
from
their
own
bowels
in
finding
clay
and
making
bricks
and
building
the
house
no
great
men
are
original
nor
does
valuable
originality
consist
in
unlikeness
to
other
men
the
hero
is
in
the
press
of
knights
and
the
thick
of
events
and
seeing
what
men
want
and
sharing
their
desire
he
adds
the
needful
length
of
sight
and
of
arm
to
come
to
the
desired
point
the
greatest
genius
is
the
most
indebted
man
a
poet
is
no
rattlebrain
saying
what
comes
uppermost
and
because
he
says
everything
saying
at
last
something
good
but
a
heart
in
unison
with
his
time
and
country
there
is
nothing
whimsical
and
fantastic
in
his
production
but
sweet
and
sad
earnest
freighted
with
the
weightiest
convictions
and
pointed
with
the
most
determined
aim
which
any
man
or
class
knows
of
in
his
times
the
genius
of
our
life
is
jealous
of
individuals
and
will
not
have
any
individual
great
except
through
the
general
there
is
no
choice
to
genius
a
great
man
does
not
wake
up
on
some
fine
morning
and
say
i
am
full
of
life
i
will
go
to
sea
and
find
an
antarctic
continent
i
will
square
the
circle
i
will
ransack
botany
and
find
a
new
food
for
man
i
have
a
new
architecture
in
my
mind
i
foresee
a
new
mechanic
power
no
but
he
finds
himself
in
the
river
of
the
thoughts
and
events
forced
onward
by
the
ideas
and
necessities
of
his
contemporaries
he
stands
where
all
the
eyes
of
men
look
one
way
and
their
hands
all
point
in
the
direction
in
which
he
should
go
the
church
has
reared
him
amidst
rites
and
pomps
and
he
carries
out
the
advice
which
her
music
gave
him
and
builds
a
cathedral
needed
by
her
chants
and
processions
he
finds
a
war
raging
it
educates
him
by
trumpet
in
barracks
and
he
betters
the
instruction
he
finds
two
counties
groping
to
bring
coal
or
flour
or
fish
from
the
place
of
production
to
the
place
of
consumption
and
he
hits
on
a
railroad
every
master
has
found
his
materials
collected
and
his
power
lay
in
his
sympathy
with
his
people
and
in
his
love
of
the
materials
he
wrought
in
what
an
economy
of
power
and
what
a
compensation
for
the
shortness
of
life
all
is
done
to
his
hand
the
world
has
brought
him
thus
far
on
his
way
the
human
race
has
gone
out
before
him
sunk
the
hills
filled
the
hollows
and
bridged
the
rivers
men
nations
poets
artisans
women
all
have
worked
for
him
and
he
enters
into
their
labors
choose
any
other
thing
out
of
the
line
of
tendency
out
of
the
national
feeling
and
history
and
he
would
have
all
to
do
for
himself
his
powers
would
be
expended
in
the
first
preparations
great
genial
power
one
would
almost
say
consists
in
not
being
original
at
all
in
being
altogether
receptive
in
letting
the
world
do
all
and
suffering
the
spirit
of
the
hour
to
pass
unobstructed
through
the
mind
shakspeare
youth
fell
in
a
time
when
the
english
people
were
importunate
for
dramatic
entertainments
the
court
took
offense
easily
at
political
allusions
and
attempted
to
suppress
them
the
puritans
a
growing
and
energetic
party
and
the
religious
among
the
anglican
church
would
suppress
them
but
the
people
wanted
them
houses
without
roofs
and
extemporaneous
inclosures
at
country
fairs
were
the
ready
theaters
of
strolling
players
the
people
had
tasted
this
new
joy
and
as
we
could
not
hope
to
suppress
newspapers
now
no
not
by
the
strongest
party
neither
then
could
king
prelate
or
puritan
alone
or
united
suppress
an
organ
which
was
ballad
epic
newspaper
caucus
lecture
punch
and
library
at
the
same
time
probably
king
prelate
and
puritan
all
found
their
own
account
in
it
it
had
become
by
all
causes
a
national
interest
by
no
means
conspicuous
so
that
some
great
scholar
would
have
thought
of
treating
it
in
an
english
history
but
not
a
whit
less
considerable
because
it
was
cheap
and
of
no
account
like
a
baker
shop
the
best
proof
of
its
vitality
is
the
crowd
of
writers
which
suddenly
broke
into
this
field
kyd
marlow
greene
jonson
chapman
dekker
webster
heywood
middleton
peele
ford
massinger
beaumont
and
fletcher
the
secure
possession
by
the
stage
of
the
public
mind
is
of
the
first
importance
to
the
poet
who
works
for
it
he
loses
no
time
in
idle
experiments
here
is
audience
and
expectation
prepared
in
the
case
of
shakspeare
there
is
much
more
at
the
time
when
he
left
stratford
and
went
up
to
london
a
great
body
of
of
all
dates
and
writers
existed
in
manuscript
and
were
in
turn
produced
on
the
boards
here
is
the
tale
of
troy
which
the
audience
will
bear
hearing
some
part
of
every
week
the
death
of
julius
cæsar
and
other
stories
out
of
plutarch
which
they
never
tire
of
a
shelf
full
of
english
history
from
the
chronicles
of
brut
and
arthur
down
to
the
royal
henries
which
men
hear
eagerly
and
a
string
of
doleful
tragedies
merry
italian
tales
and
spanish
voyages
which
all
the
london
prentices
know
all
the
mass
has
been
treated
with
more
or
less
skill
by
every
playwright
and
the
prompter
has
the
soiled
and
tattered
manuscripts
it
is
now
no
longer
possible
to
say
who
wrote
them
first
they
have
been
the
property
of
the
theater
so
long
and
so
many
rising
geniuses
have
enlarged
or
altered
them
inserting
a
speech
or
a
whole
scene
or
adding
a
song
that
no
man
can
any
longer
claim
copyright
in
this
work
of
numbers
happily
no
man
wishes
to
they
are
not
yet
desired
in
that
way
we
have
few
readers
many
spectators
and
hearers
they
had
best
lie
where
they
are
shakspeare
in
common
with
his
comrades
esteemed
the
mass
of
old
plays
waste
stock
in
which
any
experiment
could
be
freely
tried
had
the
which
hedges
about
a
modern
tragedy
existed
nothing
could
have
been
done
the
rude
warm
blood
of
the
living
england
circulated
in
the
play
as
in
and
gave
body
which
he
wanted
to
his
airy
and
majestic
fancy
the
poet
needs
a
ground
in
popular
tradition
on
which
he
may
work
and
which
again
may
restrain
his
art
within
the
due
temperance
it
holds
him
to
the
people
supplies
a
foundation
for
his
edifice
and
in
furnishing
so
much
work
done
to
his
hand
leaves
him
at
leisure
and
in
full
strength
for
the
audacities
of
his
imagination
in
short
the
poet
owes
to
his
legend
what
sculpture
owed
to
the
temple
sculpture
in
egypt
and
in
greece
grew
up
in
subordination
to
architecture
it
was
the
ornament
of
the
temple
wall
at
first
a
rude
relief
carved
on
pediments
then
the
relief
became
bolder
and
a
head
or
arm
was
projected
from
the
wall
the
groups
being
still
arranged
with
reference
to
the
building
which
serves
also
as
a
frame
to
hold
the
figures
and
when
at
last
the
greatest
freedom
of
style
and
treatment
was
reached
the
prevailing
genius
of
architecture
still
enforced
a
certain
calmness
and
continence
in
the
statue
as
soon
as
the
statue
was
begun
for
itself
and
with
no
reference
to
the
temple
or
palace
the
art
began
to
decline
freak
extravagance
and
exhibition
took
the
place
of
the
old
temperance
this
which
the
sculptor
found
in
architecture
the
perilous
irritability
of
poetic
talent
found
in
the
accumulated
dramatic
materials
to
which
the
people
were
already
wonted
and
which
had
a
certain
excellence
which
no
single
genius
however
extraordinary
could
hope
to
create
in
point
of
fact
it
appears
that
shakspeare
did
owe
debts
in
all
directions
and
was
able
to
use
whatever
he
found
and
the
amount
of
indebtedness
may
be
inferred
from
malone
laborious
computations
in
regard
to
the
first
second
and
third
parts
of
henry
in
which
out
of
lines
were
written
by
some
author
preceding
shakspeare
by
him
on
the
foundation
laid
by
his
predecessors
and
were
entirely
his
own
and
the
proceeding
investigation
hardly
leaves
a
single
drama
of
his
absolute
invention
sentence
is
an
important
piece
of
external
history
in
henry
viii
i
think
i
see
plainly
the
cropping
out
of
the
original
rock
on
which
his
own
finer
stratum
was
laid
the
first
play
was
written
by
a
superior
thoughtful
man
with
a
vicious
ear
i
can
mark
his
lines
and
know
well
their
cadence
see
wolsey
soliloquy
and
the
following
scene
from
cromwell
where
instead
of
the
meter
of
shakspeare
whose
secret
is
that
the
thought
constructs
the
tune
so
that
reading
for
the
sense
will
best
bring
out
the
rhythm
here
the
lines
are
constructed
on
a
given
tune
and
the
verse
has
even
a
trace
of
pulpit
eloquence
but
the
play
contains
through
all
its
length
unmistakable
traits
of
shakspeare
hand
and
some
passages
as
the
account
of
the
coronation
are
like
autographs
what
is
odd
the
compliment
to
queen
elizabeth
is
in
bad
rhythm
shakspeare
knew
that
tradition
supplies
a
better
fable
than
any
invention
can
if
he
lost
any
credit
of
design
he
augmented
his
resources
and
at
that
day
our
petulant
demand
for
originality
was
not
so
much
pressed
there
was
no
literature
for
the
million
the
universal
reading
the
cheap
press
were
unknown
a
great
poet
who
appears
in
illiterate
times
absorbs
into
his
sphere
all
the
light
which
is
anywhere
radiating
every
intellectual
jewel
every
flower
of
sentiment
it
is
his
fine
office
to
bring
to
his
people
and
he
comes
to
value
his
memory
equally
with
his
invention
he
is
therefore
little
solicitous
whence
his
thoughts
have
been
derived
whether
through
translation
whether
through
tradition
whether
by
travel
in
distant
countries
whether
by
inspiration
from
whatever
source
they
are
equally
welcome
to
his
uncritical
audience
nay
he
borrows
very
near
home
other
men
say
wise
things
as
well
as
he
only
they
say
a
good
many
foolish
things
and
do
not
know
when
they
have
spoken
wisely
he
knows
the
sparkle
of
the
true
stone
and
puts
it
in
high
place
wherever
he
finds
it
such
is
the
happy
position
of
homer
perhaps
of
chaucer
of
saadi
they
felt
that
all
wit
was
their
wit
and
they
are
librarians
and
historiographers
as
well
as
poets
each
romancer
was
heir
and
dispenser
of
all
the
hundred
tales
of
the
world
presenting
thebes
and
pelops
line
and
the
tale
of
troy
divine
the
influence
of
chaucer
is
conspicuous
in
all
our
early
literature
and
more
recently
not
only
pope
and
dryden
have
been
beholden
to
him
but
in
the
whole
society
of
english
writers
a
large
unacknowledged
debt
is
easily
traced
one
is
charmed
with
the
opulence
which
feeds
so
many
pensioners
but
chaucer
is
a
huge
borrower
chaucer
it
seems
drew
continually
through
lydgat
and
caxton
from
guido
di
colonna
whose
latin
romance
of
the
trojan
war
was
in
turn
a
compilation
from
dares
phrygius
ovid
and
statius
then
petrarch
boccaccio
and
the
provençal
poets
and
his
benefactors
the
romaunt
of
the
rose
is
only
judicious
translation
from
william
of
lorris
and
john
of
meung
troilus
and
creseide
from
lollius
of
urbino
the
cock
and
the
fox
from
the
of
marie
the
house
of
fame
from
the
french
or
italian
and
poor
gower
he
uses
as
if
he
were
only
a
or
out
of
which
to
build
his
house
he
steals
by
this
apology
that
what
he
takes
has
no
worth
where
he
finds
it
and
the
greatest
where
he
leaves
it
it
has
come
to
be
practically
a
sort
of
rule
in
literature
that
a
man
having
once
shown
himself
capable
of
original
writing
is
entitled
thenceforth
to
steal
from
the
writings
of
others
at
discretion
thought
is
the
property
of
him
who
can
entertain
it
and
of
him
who
can
adequately
place
it
a
certain
awkwardness
marks
the
use
of
borrowed
thoughts
but
as
soon
as
we
have
learned
what
to
do
with
them
they
become
our
own
thus
all
originality
is
relative
every
thinker
is
retrospective
the
learned
member
of
the
legislature
at
westminister
or
at
washington
speaks
and
votes
for
thousands
show
us
the
constituency
and
the
now
invisible
channels
by
which
the
senator
is
made
aware
of
their
wishes
the
crowd
of
practical
and
knowing
men
who
by
correspondence
or
conversation
are
feeding
him
with
evidence
anecdotes
and
estimates
and
it
will
bereave
his
fine
attitude
and
resistance
of
something
of
their
impressiveness
as
sir
robert
peel
and
webster
vote
so
locke
and
rousseau
think
for
thousands
and
so
there
were
foundations
all
around
homer
menu
saada
or
milton
from
which
they
drew
friends
lovers
books
traditions
proverbs
all
perished
which
if
seen
would
go
to
reduce
the
wonder
did
the
bard
speak
with
authority
did
he
feel
himself
overmatched
by
any
companion
the
appeal
is
to
the
consciousness
of
the
writer
is
there
at
last
in
his
breast
a
delphi
whereof
to
ask
concerning
any
thought
or
thing
whether
it
be
verily
so
yea
or
nay
and
to
have
answer
and
rely
on
that
all
the
debts
which
such
a
man
could
contract
to
other
wit
would
never
disturb
his
consciousness
of
originality
for
the
ministrations
of
books
and
of
other
minds
are
a
whiff
of
smoke
to
that
most
private
reality
with
which
he
has
conversed
it
is
easy
to
see
that
what
is
best
written
or
done
by
genius
in
the
world
was
no
man
work
but
came
by
wide
social
labor
when
a
thousand
wrought
like
one
sharing
the
same
impulse
our
english
bible
is
a
wonderful
specimen
of
the
strength
and
music
of
the
english
language
but
it
was
not
made
by
one
man
or
at
one
time
but
centuries
and
churches
brought
it
to
perfection
there
never
was
a
time
when
there
was
not
some
translation
existing
the
liturgy
admired
for
its
energy
and
pathos
is
an
anthology
of
the
piety
of
ages
and
nations
a
translation
of
the
prayers
and
forms
of
the
catholic
church
these
collected
too
in
long
periods
from
the
prayers
and
meditations
of
every
saint
and
sacred
writer
all
over
the
world
grotius
makes
the
like
remark
in
respect
to
the
prayer
that
the
single
clauses
of
which
it
is
composed
were
already
in
use
in
the
time
of
christ
in
the
rabbinical
forms
he
picked
out
the
grains
of
gold
the
nervous
language
of
the
common
law
the
impressive
forms
of
our
courts
and
the
precision
and
substantial
truth
of
the
legal
distinctions
are
the
contribution
of
all
the
men
who
have
lived
in
the
countries
where
these
laws
govern
the
translation
of
plutarch
gets
its
excellence
by
being
translation
on
translation
there
never
was
a
time
when
there
was
none
all
the
truly
idiomatic
and
national
phrases
are
kept
and
all
others
successively
picked
out
and
thrown
away
something
like
the
same
process
had
gone
on
long
before
with
the
originals
of
these
books
the
world
takes
liberties
with
vedas
fables
pilpay
arabian
nights
cid
iliad
robin
hood
scottish
minstrelsy
are
not
the
work
of
single
men
in
the
composition
of
such
works
the
time
thinks
the
market
thinks
the
mason
the
carpenter
the
merchant
the
farmer
the
fop
all
think
for
us
every
book
supplies
its
time
with
one
good
word
every
municipal
law
every
trade
every
folly
of
the
day
and
the
generic
catholic
genius
who
is
not
afraid
or
ashamed
to
owe
his
originality
to
the
originality
of
all
stands
with
the
next
age
as
the
recorder
and
embodiment
of
his
own
we
have
to
thank
the
researches
of
antiquaries
and
the
shakspeare
society
for
ascertaining
the
steps
of
the
english
drama
from
the
mysteries
celebrated
in
churches
and
by
churchmen
and
the
final
detachment
from
the
church
and
the
completion
of
secular
plays
from
ferrex
and
porrex
and
gammer
gurton
needle
down
to
the
possession
of
the
stage
by
the
very
pieces
which
shakspeare
altered
remodelled
and
finally
made
his
own
elated
with
success
and
piqued
by
the
growing
interest
of
the
problem
they
have
left
no
unsearched
no
chest
in
a
garret
unopened
no
file
of
old
yellow
accounts
to
decompose
in
damp
and
worms
so
keen
was
the
hope
to
discover
whether
the
boy
shakspeare
poached
or
not
whether
he
held
horses
at
the
whether
he
kept
school
and
why
he
left
in
his
will
only
his
bed
to
ann
hathaway
his
wife
there
is
somewhat
touching
in
the
madness
with
which
the
passing
age
mischooses
the
object
on
which
all
candles
shine
and
all
eyes
are
turned
the
care
with
which
it
registers
every
trifle
touching
queen
elizabeth
and
king
james
and
the
essexes
leicesters
burleighs
and
buckinghams
and
lets
pass
without
a
single
valuable
note
the
founder
of
another
dynasty
which
alone
will
cause
the
tudor
dynasty
to
be
remembered
the
man
who
carries
the
saxon
race
in
him
by
the
inspiration
which
feeds
him
and
on
whose
thoughts
the
foremost
people
of
the
world
are
now
for
some
ages
to
be
nourished
and
minds
to
receive
this
and
not
another
bias
a
popular
player
nobody
suspected
he
was
the
poet
of
the
human
race
and
the
secret
was
kept
as
faithfully
from
poets
and
intellectual
men
as
from
courtiers
and
frivolous
people
bacon
who
took
the
inventory
of
the
human
understanding
for
his
times
never
mentioned
his
name
ben
jonson
though
we
have
strained
his
few
words
of
regard
and
panegyric
had
no
suspicion
of
the
elastic
fame
whose
first
vibrations
he
was
attempting
he
no
doubt
thought
the
praise
he
has
conceded
to
him
generous
and
esteemed
himself
out
of
all
question
the
better
poet
of
the
two
if
it
need
wit
to
know
wit
according
to
the
proverb
time
should
be
capable
of
recognizing
it
sir

wotton
was
born
four
years

many
others
whom
doubtless
he
saw
shakspeare
spenser
jonson
beaumont
massinger
two
herberts
marlow
chapman
and
the
rest
since
the
constellation
of
great
men
who
appeared
in
greece
in
the
time
of
pericles
there
was
never
any
such
society
yet
their
genius
failed
them
to
find
out
the
best
head
in
the
universe
our
poet
mask
was
impenetrable
you
can
not
see
the
mountain
near
it
took
a
century
to
make
it
suspected
and
not
until
two
centuries
had
passed
after
his
death
did
any
criticism
which
we
think
adequate
begin
to
appear
it
was
not
possible
to
write
the
history
of
shakspeare
till
now
for
he
is
the
father
of
german
literature
it
was
on
the
introduction
of
shakspeare
into
german
by
lessing
and
the
translation
of
his
works
by
wieland
and
schlegel
that
the
rapid
burst
of
german
literature
was
most
intimately
connected
it
was
not
until
the
nineteenth
century
whose
speculative
genius
is
a
sort
of
living
hamlet
that
the
tragedy
of
hamlet
could
find
such
wondering
readers
now
literature
philosophy
and
thought
are
shakspearized
his
mind
is
the
horizon
beyond
which
at
present
we
do
not
see
our
ears
are
educated
to
music
by
his
rhythm
coleridge
and
goethe
are
the
only
critics
who
have
expressed
our
convictions
with
any
adequate
fidelity
but
there
is
in
all
cultivated
minds
a
silent
appreciation
of
his
superlative
power
and
beauty
which
like
christianity
qualifies
the
period
transcriber
note
number
runs
from
to
number
omitted
the
shakspeare
society
have
inquired
in
all
directions
advertised
the
missing
facts
offered
money
for
any
information
that
will
lead
to
proof
and
with
what
result
beside
some
important
illustration
of
the
history
of
the
english
stage
to
which
i
have
adverted
they
have
gleaned
a
few
facts
touching
the
property
and
dealings
in
regard
to
property
of
the
poet
it
appears
that
from
year
to
year
he
owned
a
larger
share
in
the
theater
its
wardrobe
and
other
appurtenances
were
his
and
he
bought
an
estate
in
his
native
village
with
his
earnings
as
writer
and
shareholder
that
he
lived
in
the
best
house
in
stratford
was
intrusted
by
his
neighbors
with
their
commissions
in
london
as
of
borrowing
money
and
the
like
and
he
was
a
veritable
farmer
about
the
time
when
he
was
writing
macbeth
he
sues
philip
rogers
in
the
of
stratford
for
shillings
ten
pence
for
corn
delivered
to
him
at
different
times
and
in
all
respects
appears
as
a
good
husband
with
no
reputation
for
eccentricity
or
excess
he
was
a
sort
of
man
an
actor
and
shareholder
in
the
theater
not
in
any
striking
manner
distinguished
from
other
actors
and
managers
i
admit
the
importance
of
this
information
it
is
well
worth
the
pains
that
have
been
taken
to
procure
it
but
whatever
scraps
of
information
concerning
his
condition
these
researches
may
have

no

to

up

which
sees

for

history
shakspeare
is
the
only
biographer
of
shakspeare
and
even
he
can
tell
nothing
except
to
the
shakspeare
in
us
that
is
to
our
most
apprehensive
and
sympathetic
hour
he
can
not
step
from
off
his
tripod
and
give
us
anecdotes
of
his
inspirations
read
the
antique
documents
extricated
analyzed
and
compared
by
the
assiduous
dyce
and
collier
and
now
read
one
of
those
skyey
sentences
aerolites
which
seem
to
have
fallen
out
of
heaven
and
which
not
your
experience
but
the
man
within
the
breast
has
accepted
as
words
of
fate
and
tell
me
if
they
match
if
the
former
account
in
any
manner
for
the
latter
or
which
gives
the
most
historical
insight
into
the
man
hence
though
our
external
history
is
so
meager
yet
with
shakspeare
for
biographer
instead
of
aubrey
and
rowe
we
have
really
the
information
which
is
material
that
which
describes
character
and
fortune
that
which
if
we
were
about
to
meet
the
man
and
deal
with
him
would
most
import
us
to
know
we
have
his
recorded
convictions
on
those
questions
which
knock
for
answer
at
every
heart
on
life
and
death
on
love
on
wealth
and
poverty
on
the
prizes
of
life
and
the
ways
whereby
we
come
at
them
on
the
characters
of
men
and
the
influences
occult
and
open
which
affect
their
fortunes
and
on
those
mysterious
and
demoniacal
powers
which
defy
our
science
and
which
yet
interweave
their
malice
and
their
gift
in
our
brightest
hours
who
ever
read
the
volume
of
the
sonnets
without
finding
that
the
poet
had
there
revealed
under
masks
that
are
no
masks
to
the
intelligent
the
lore
of
friendship
and
of
love
the
confusion
of
sentiments
in
the
most
susceptible
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
intellectual
of
men
what
trait
of
his
private
mind
has
he
hidden
in
his
dramas
one
can
discern
in
his
ample
pictures
of
the
gentleman
and
the
king
what
forms
and
humanities
pleased
him
his
delight
in
troops
of
friends
in
large
hospitality
in
cheerful
giving
let
timon
let
warwick
let
antonio
the
merchant
answer
for
his
great
heart
so
far
from
shakspeare
being
the
least
known
he
is
the
one
person
in
all
modern
history
known
to
us
what
point
of
morals
of
manners
of
economy
of
philosophy
of
religion
of
taste
of
the
conduct
of
life
has
he
not
settled
what
mystery
has
he
not
signified
his
knowledge
of
what
office
or
function
or
district
of
man
work
has
he
not
remembered
what
king
has
he
not
taught
state
as
talma
taught
napoleon
what
maiden
has
not
found
him
finer
than
her
delicacy
what
lover
has
he
not
what
sage
has
he
not
outseen
what
gentleman
has
he
not
instructed
in
the
rudeness
of
his
behavior
some
able
and
appreciating
critics
think
no
criticism
on
shakspeare
valuable
that
does
not
rest
purely
on
the
dramatic
merit
that
he
is
falsely
judged
as
poet
and
philosopher
i
think
as
highly
as
these
critics
of
his
dramatic
merit
who
still
think
it
secondary
he
was
a
full
man
who
liked
to
talk
a
brain
exhaling
thoughts
and
images
which
seeking
vent
found
the
drama
next
at
hand
had
he
been
less
we
should
have
had
to
consider
how
well
he
filled
his
place
how
good
a
dramatist
he
was
and
he
is
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
turns
out
that
what
he
has
to
say
is
of
that
weight
as
to
withdraw
some
attention
from
the
vehicle
and
he
is
like
some
saint
whose
history
is
to
be
rendered
into
all
languages
into
verse
and
prose
into
songs
and
pictures
and
cut
up
into
proverbs
so
that
the
occasion
which
gave
the
saint
meaning
the
form
of
a
conversation
or
of
a
prayer
or
of
a
code
of
laws
is
immaterial
compared
with
the
universality
of
its
application
so
it
fares
with
the
wise
shakspeare
and
his
book
of
life
he
wrote
the
airs
for
all
our
modern
music
he
wrote
the
text
of
modern
life
the
text
of
manners
he
drew
the
man
of
england
and
europe
the
father
of
the
man
in
america
he
drew
the
man
and
described
the
day
and
what
is
done
in
it
he
read
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
their
probity
and
their
second
thought
and
wiles
the
wiles
of
innocence
and
the
transitions
by
which
virtues
and
vices
slide
into
their
contraries
he
could
divide
the
mother
part
from
the
father
part
in
the
face
of
the
child
or
draw
the
fine
demarcations
of
freedom
and
of
fate
he
knew
the
laws
of
repression
which
make
the
police
of
nature
and
all
the
sweets
and
all
the
terrors
of
human
lot
lay
in
his
mind
as
truly
but
as
softly
as
the
landscape
lies
on
the
eye
and
the
importance
of
this
wisdom
of
life
sinks
the
form
as
of
drama
or
epic
out
of
notice
is
like
making
a
question
concerning
the
paper
on
which
a
king
message
is
written
shakspeare
is
as
much
out
of
the
category
of
eminent
authors
as
he
is
out
of
the
crowd
he
is
inconceivably
wise
the
others
conceivably
a
good
reader
can
in
a
sort
nestle
into
plato
brain
and
think
from
thence
but
not
into
shakspeare
we
are
still
out
of
doors
for
executive
faculty
for
creation
shakspeare
is
unique
no
man
can
imagine
it
better
he
was
the
farthest
reach
of
subtlety
compatible
with
an
individual
self
the
subtilest
of
authors
and
only
just
within
the
possibility
of
authorship
with
this
wisdom
of
life
is
the
equal
endowment
of
imaginative
and
of
lyric
power
he
clothed
the
creatures
of
his
legend
with
form
and
sentiments
as
if
they
were
people
who
had
lived
under
his
roof
and
few
real
men
have
left
such
distinct
characters
as
these
fictions
and
they
spoke
in
language
as
sweet
as
it
was
fit
yet
his
talents
never
seduced
him
into
an
ostentation
nor
did
he
harp
on
one
string
an
omnipresent
humanity
coördinates
all
his
faculties
give
a
man
of
talents
a
story
to
tell
and
his
partiality
will
presently
appear
he
has
certain
observations
opinions
topics
which
have
some
accidental
prominence
and
which
he
disposes
all
to
exhibit
he
crams
this
part
and
starves
that
other
part
consulting
not
the
fitness
of
the
thing
but
his
fitness
and
strength
but
shakspeare
has
no
peculiarity
no
importunate
topic
but
all
is
duly
given
no
veins
no
curiosities
no
no
no
mannerist
is
he
he
has
no
discoverable
egotism
the
great
he
tells
greatly
the
small
subordinately
he
is
wise
without
emphasis
or
assertion
he
is
strong
as
nature
is
strong
who
lifts
the
land
into
mountain
slopes
without
effort
and
by
the
same
rule
as
she
floats
a
bubble
in
the
air
and
likes
as
well
to
do
the
one
as
the
other
this
makes
that
equality
of
power
in
farce
tragedy
narrative
and
a
merit
so
incessant
that
each
reader
is
incredulous
of
the
perception
of
other
readers
this
power
of
expression
or
of
transferring
the
inmost
truth
of
things
into
music
and
verse
makes
him
the
type
of
the
poet
and
has
added
a
new
problem
to
metaphysics
this
is
that
which
throws
him
into
natural
history
as
a
main
production
of
the
globe
and
as
announcing
new
eras
and
ameliorations
things
were
mirrored
in
his
poetry
without
loss
or
blur
he
could
paint
the
fine
with
precision
the
great
with
compass
the
tragic
and
the
comic
indifferently
and
without
any
distortion
or
favor
he
carried
his
powerful
execution
into
minute
details
to
a
hair
point
finishes
an
eyelash
or
a
dimple
as
firmly
as
he
draws
a
mountain
and
yet
these
like
nature
will
bear
the
scrutiny
of
the
solar
microscope
in
short
he
is
the
chief
example
to
prove
that
more
or
less
of
production
more
or
fewer
pictures
is
a
thing
indifferent
he
had
the
power
to
make
one
picture
daguerre
learned
how
to
let
one
flower
etch
its
image
on
his
plate
of
iodine
and
then
proceeds
at
leisure
to
etch
a
million
there
are
always
objects
but
there
was
never
representation
here
is
perfect
representation
at
last
and
now
let
the
world
of
figures
sit
for
their
portraits
no
recipe
can
be
given
for
the
making
of
a
shakspeare
but
the
possibility
of
the
translation
of
things
into
song
is
demonstrated
his
lyric
power
lies
in
the
genius
of
the
piece
the
sonnets
though
their
excellence
is
lost
in
the
splendor
of
the
dramas
are
as
inimitable
as
they
and
it
is
not
a
merit
of
lines
but
a
total
merit
of
the
piece
like
the
tone
of
voice
of
some
incomparable
person
so
is
this
a
speech
of
poetic
beings
and
any
clause
as
unproducible
now
as
a
whole
poem
though
the
speeches
in
the
plays
and
single
lines
have
a
beauty
which
tempts
the
ear
to
pause
on
them
for
their
euphuism
yet
the
sentence
is
so
loaded
with
meaning
and
so
linked
with
its
foregoers
and
followers
that
the
logician
is
satisfied
his
means
are
as
admirable
as
his
ends
every
subordinate
invention
by
which
he
helps
himself
to
connect
some
irreconcilable
opposites
is
a
poem
too
he
is
not
reduced
to
dismount
and
walk
because
his
horses
are
running
off
with
him
in
some
distant
direction
he
always
rides
the
finest
poetry
was
first
experienced
but
the
thought
has
suffered
a
transformation
since
it
was
an
experience
cultivated
men
often
attain
a
good
degree
of
skill
in
writing
verses
but
it
is
easy
to
read
through
their
poems
their
personal
history
any
one
acquainted
with
parties
can
name
every
figure
this
is
andrew
and
that
is
rachael
the
sense
thus
remains
prosaic
it
is
a
caterpillar
with
wings
and
not
yet
a
butterfly
in
the
poet
mind
the
fact
has
gone
quite
over
into
the
new
element
of
thought
and
has
lost
all
that
is
exuvial
this
generosity
bides
with
shakspeare
we
say
from
the
truth
and
closeness
of
his
pictures
that
he
knows
the
lesson
by
heart
yet
there
is
not
a
trace
of
egotism
one
more
royal
trait
properly
belongs
to
the
poet
i
mean
his
cheerfulness
without
which
no
man
can
be
a
poet
for
beauty
is
his
aim
he
loves
virtue
not
for
its
obligation
but
for
its
grace
he
delights
in
the
world
in
man
in
woman
for
the
lovely
light
that
sparkles
from
them
beauty
the
spirit
of
joy
and
hilarity
he
sheds
over
the
universe
epicurus
relates
that
poetry
hath
such
charms
that
a
lover
might
forsake
his
mistress
to
partake
of
them
and
the
true
bards
have
been
noted
for
their
firm
and
cheerful
temper
homer
lies
in
sunshine
chaucer
is
glad
and
erect
and
saadi
says
it
was
rumored
abroad
that
i
was
penitent
but
what
had
i
to
do
with
repentance
not
less
sovereign
and
cheerful
much
more
sovereign
and
cheerful
is
the
tone
of
shakspeare
his
name
suggests
joy
and
emancipation
to
the
heart
of
men
if
he
should
appear
in
any
company
of
human
souls
who
would
not
march
in
his
troop
he
touches
nothing
that
does
not
borrow
health
and
longevity
from
his
festal
style
and
now
how
stands
the
account
of
man
with
this
bard
and
benefactor
when
in
solitude
shutting
our
ears
to
the
reverberations
of
his
fame
we
seek
to
strike
the
balance
solitude
has
austere
lessons
it
can
teach
us
to
spare
both
heroes
and
poets
and
it
weighs
shakspeare
also
and
finds
him
to
share
the
halfness
and
imperfection
of
humanity
shakspeare
homer
dante
chaucer
saw
the
splendor
of
meaning
that
plays
over
the
visible
world
knew
that
a
tree
had
another
use
than
for
apples
and
corn
another
than
for
meal
and
the
ball
of
the
earth
than
for
tillage
and
roads
that
these
things
bore
a
second
and
finer
harvest
to
the
mind
being
emblems
of
its
thoughts
and
conveying
in
all
their
natural
history
a
certain
mute
commentary
on
human
life
shakspeare
employed
them
as
colors
to
compose
his
picture
he
rested
in
their
beauty
and
never
took
the
step
which
seemed
inevitable
to
such
genius
namely
to
explore
the
virtue
which
resides
in
these
symbols
and
imparts
this
power
what
is
that
which
they
themselves
say
he
converted
the
elements
which
waited
on
his
command
into
entertainments
he
was
master
of
the
revels
to
mankind
is
it
not
as
if
one
should
have
through
majestic
powers
of
science
the
comets
given
into
his
hand
or
the
planets
and
their
moons
and
should
draw
them
from
their
orbits
to
glare
with
the
municipal
fireworks
on
a
holiday
night
and
advertise
in
all
towns
very
superior
pyrotechny
this
evening
are
the
agents
of
nature
and
the
power
to
understand
them
worth
no
more
than
a
street
serenade
or
the
breath
of
a
cigar
one
remembers
again
the
in
the
koran
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
that
is
between
them
think
ye
we
have
created
them
in
jest
as
long
as
the
question
is
of
talent
and
mental
power
the
world
of
men
has
not
his
equal
to
show
but
when
the
question
is
to
life
and
its
materials
and
its
auxiliaries
how
does
he
profit
me
what
does
it
signify
it
is
but
a
twelfth
night
or
midsummer
night
dream
or
a
winter
evening
tale
what
signifies
another
picture
more
or
less
the
egyptian
verdict
of
the
shakspeare
societies
comes
to
mind
that
he
was
a
jovial
actor
and
manager
i
can
not
marry
this
fact
to
his
verse
other
admirable
men
have
led
lives
in
some
sort
of
keeping
with
their
thought
but
this
man
in
wide
contrast
had
he
been
less
had
he
reached
only
the
common
measure
of
great
authors
of
bacon
milton
tasso
cervantes
we
might
leave
the
fact
in
the
twilight
of
human
fate
but
that
this
man
of
men
he
who
gave
to
the
science
of
mind
a
new
and
larger
subject
than
had
ever
existed
and
planted
the
standard
of
humanity
some
furlongs
forward
into
chaos
that
he
should
not
be
wise
for
himself
it
must
even
go
into
the
world
history
that
the
best
poet
led
an
obscure
and
profane
life
using
his
genius
for
the
public
amusement
well
other
men
priest
and
prophet
israelite
german
and
swede
beheld
the
same
objects
they
also
saw
through
them
that
which
was
contained
and
to
what
purpose
the
beauty
straightway
vanished
they
read
commandments
mountainous
duty
an
obligation
a
sadness
as
of
piled
mountains
fell
on
them
and
life
became
ghastly
joyless
a
pilgrim
progress
a
probation
beleaguered
round
with
doleful
histories
of
adam
fall
and
curse
behind
us
with
doomsdays
and
purgatorial
and
penal
fires
before
us
and
the
heart
of
the
seer
and
the
heart
of
the
listener
sank
in
them
it
must
be
conceded
that
these
are
of
the
world
still
wants
its
a
reconciler
who
shall
not
trifle
with
shakspeare
the
player
nor
shall
grope
in
graves
with
swedenborg
the
mourner
but
who
shall
see
speak
and
act
with
equal
inspiration
for
knowledge
will
brighten
the
sunshine
right
is
more
beautiful
than
private
affection
and
love
is
compatible
with
universal
wisdom
prudence
what
right
have
i
to
write
on
prudence
whereof
i
have
little
and
that
of
the
negative
sort
my
prudence
consists
in
avoiding
and
going
without
not
in
the
inventing
of
means
and
methods
not
in
adroit
steering
not
in
gentle
repairing
i
have
no
skill
to
make
money
spend
well
no
genius
in
my
economy
and
whoever
sees
my
garden
discovers
that
i
must
have
some
other
garden
yet
i
love
facts
and
hate
lubricity
and
people
without
perception
then
i
have
the
same
title
to
write
on
prudence
that
i
have
to
write
on
poetry
or
holiness
we
write
from
aspiration
and
antagonism
as
well
as
from
experience
we
paint
those
qualities
which
we
do
not
possess
the
poet
admires
the
man
of
energy
and
tactics
the
merchant
breeds
his
son
for
the
church
or
the
bar
and
where
a
man
is
not
vain
and
egotistic
you
shall
find
what
he
has
not
by
his
praise
moreover
it
would
be
hardly
honest
in
me
not
to
balance
these
fine
lyric
words
of
love
and
friendship
with
words
of
coarser
sound
and
whilst
my
debt
to
my
senses
is
real
and
constant
not
to
own
it
in
passing
prudence
is
the
virtue
of
the
senses
it
is
the
science
of
appearances
it
is
the
outmost
action
of
the
inward
life
it
is
god
taking
thought
for
oxen
it
moves
matter
after
the
laws
of
matter
it
is
content
to
seek
health
of
body
by
complying
with
physical
conditions
and
health
of
mind
by
the
laws
of
the
intellect
the
world
of
the
senses
is
a
world
of
shows
it
does
not
exist
for
itself
but
has
a
symbolic
character
and
a
true
prudence
or
law
of
shows
recognizes
the
of
other
laws
and
knows
that
its
own
office
is
subaltern
knows
that
it
is
surface
and
not
centre
where
it
works
prudence
is
false
when
detached
it
is
legitimate
when
it
is
the
natural
history
of
the
soul
incarnate
when
it
unfolds
the
beauty
of
laws
within
the
narrow
scope
of
the
senses
there
are
all
degrees
of
proficiency
in
knowledge
of
the
world
it
is
sufficient
to
our
present
purpose
to
indicate
three
one
class
lives
to
the
utility
of
the
symbol
esteeming
health
and
wealth
a
final
good
another
class
live
above
this
mark
of
the
beauty
of
the
symbol
as
the
poet
and
artist
and
the
naturalist
and
man
of
science
a
third
class
live
above
the
beauty
of
the
symbol
to
the
beauty
of
the
thing
signified
these
are
wise
men
the
first
class
have
common
sense
the
second
taste
and
the
third
spiritual
perception
once
in
a
long
time
a
man
traverses
the
whole
scale
and
sees
and
enjoys
the
symbol
solidly
then
also
has
a
clear
eye
for
its
beauty
and
lastly
whilst
he
pitches
his
tent
on
this
sacred
volcanic
isle
of
nature
does
not
offer
to
build
houses
and
barns
thereon
reverencing
the
splendor
of
the
god
which
he
sees
bursting
through
each
chink
and
cranny
the
world
is
filled
with
the
proverbs
and
acts
and
winkings
of
a
base
prudence
which
is
a
devotion
to
matter
as
if
we
possessed
no
other
faculties
than
the
palate
the
nose
the
touch
the
eye
and
ear
a
prudence
which
adores
the
rule
of
three
which
never
subscribes
which
gives
never
which
seldom
lends
and
asks
but
one
question
of
any
project
will
it
bake
bread
this
is
a
disease
like
a
thickening
of
the
skin
until
the
vital
organs
are
destroyed
but
culture
revealing
the
high
origin
of
the
apparent
world
and
aiming
at
the
perfection
of
the
man
as
the
end
degrades
everything
else
as
health
and
bodily
life
into
means
it
sees
prudence
not
to
be
a
several
faculty
but
a
name
for
wisdom
and
virtue
conversing
with
the
body
and
its
wants
cultivated
men
always
feel
and
speak
so
as
if
a
great
fortune
the
achievement
of
a
civil
or
social
measure
great
personal
influence
a
graceful
and
commanding
address
had
their
value
as
proofs
of
the
energy
of
the
spirit
if
a
man
lose
his
balance
and
immerse
himself
in
any
trades
or
pleasures
for
their
own
sake
he
may
be
a
good
wheel
or
pin
but
he
is
not
a
cultivated
man
the
spurious
prudence
making
the
senses
final
is
the
god
of
sots
and
cowards
and
is
the
subject
of
all
comedy
it
is
nature
joke
and
therefore
literature
the
true
prudence
limits
this
sensualism
by
admitting
the
knowledge
of
an
internal
and
real
world
this
recognition
once
made
the
order
of
the
world
and
the
distribution
of
affairs
and
times
being
studied
with
the
of
their
subordinate
place
will
reward
any
degree
of
attention
for
our
existence
thus
apparently
attached
in
nature
to
the
sun
and
the
returning
moon
and
the
periods
which
they
mark
so
susceptible
to
climate
and
to
country
so
alive
to
social
good
and
evil
so
fond
of
splendor
and
so
tender
to
hunger
and
cold
and
debt
reads
all
its
primary
lessons
out
of
these
books
prudence
does
not
go
behind
nature
and
ask
whence
it
is
it
takes
the
laws
of
the
world
whereby
man
being
is
conditioned
as
they
are
and
keeps
these
laws
that
it
may
enjoy
their
proper
good
it
respects
space
and
time
climate
want
sleep
the
law
of
polarity
growth
and
death
there
revolve
to
give
bound
and
period
to
his
being
on
all
sides
the
sun
and
moon
the
great
formalists
in
the
sky
here
lies
stubborn
matter
and
will
not
swerve
from
its
chemical
routine
here
is
a
planted
globe
pierced
and
belted
with
natural
laws
and
fenced
and
distributed
externally
with
civil
partitions
and
properties
which
impose
new
restraints
on
the
young
inhabitant
we
eat
of
the
bread
which
grows
in
the
field
we
live
by
the
air
which
blows
around
us
and
we
are
poisoned
by
the
air
that
is
too
cold
or
too
hot
too
dry
or
too
wet
time
which
shows
so
vacant
indivisible
and
divine
in
its
coming
is
slit
and
peddled
into
trifles
and
tatters
a
door
is
to
be
painted
a
lock
to
be
repaired
i
want
wood
or
oil
or
meal
or
salt
the
house
smokes
or
i
have
a
headache
then
the
tax
and
an
affair
to
be
transacted
with
a
man
without
heart
or
brains
and
the
stinging
recollection
of
an
injurious
or
very
awkward
word
these
eat
up
the
hours
do
what
we
can
summer
will
have
its
flies
if
we
walk
in
the
woods
we
must
feed
mosquitoes
if
we
go
we
must
expect
a
wet
coat
then
climate
is
a
great
impediment
to
idle
persons
we
often
resolve
to
give
up
the
care
of
the
weather
but
still
we
regard
the
clouds
and
the
rain
we
are
instructed
by
these
petty
experiences
which
usurp
the
hours
and
years
the
hard
soil
and
four
months
of
snow
make
the
inhabitant
of
the
northern
temperate
zone
wiser
and
abler
than
his
fellow
who
enjoys
the
fixed
smile
of
the
tropics
the
islander
may
ramble
all
day
at
will
at
night
he
may
sleep
on
a
mat
under
the
moon
and
wherever
a
wild
grows
nature
has
without
a
prayer
even
spread
a
table
for
his
morning
meal
the
northerner
is
perforce
a
householder
he
must
brew
bake
salt
and
preserve
his
food
he
must
pile
wood
and
coal
but
as
it
happens
that
not
one
stroke
can
labor
lay
to
without
some
new
acquaintance
with
nature
and
as
nature
is
inexhaustibly
significant
the
inhabitants
of
these
climates
have
always
excelled
the
southerner
in
force
such
is
the
value
of
these
matters
that
a
man
who
knows
other
things
can
never
know
too
much
of
these
let
him
have
accurate
perceptions
let
him
if
he
have
hands
handle
if
eyes
measure
and
discriminate
let
him
accept
and
hive
every
fact
of
chemistry
natural
history
and
economics
the
more
he
has
the
less
is
he
willing
to
spare
any
one
time
is
always
bringing
the
occasions
that
disclose
their
value
some
wisdom
comes
out
of
every
natural
and
innocent
action
the
domestic
man
who
loves
no
music
so
well
as
his
kitchen
clock
and
the
airs
which
the
logs
sing
to
him
as
they
burn
on
the
hearth
has
solaces
which
others
never
dream
of
the
application
of
means
to
ends
ensures
victory
and
the
songs
of
victory
not
less
in
a
farm
or
a
shop
than
in
the
tactics
of
party
or
of
war
the
good
husband
finds
method
as
efficient
in
the
packing
of
in
a
shed
or
in
the
harvesting
of
fruits
in
the
cellar
as
in
peninsular
campaigns
or
the
files
of
the
department
of
state
in
the
rainy
day
he
builds
a
or
gets
his
set
in
the
corner
of
the
and
stored
with
nails
gimlet
pincers
screwdriver
and
chisel
herein
he
tastes
an
old
joy
of
youth
and
childhood
the
love
of
garrets
presses
and
and
of
the
conveniences
of
long
housekeeping
his
garden
or
his
very
paltry
places
it
may
be
tells
him
many
pleasant
anecdotes
one
might
find
argument
for
optimism
in
the
abundant
flow
of
this
saccharine
element
of
pleasure
in
every
suburb
and
extremity
of
the
good
world
let
a
man
keep
the
law
any
law
and
his
way
will
be
strown
with
satisfactions
there
is
more
difference
in
the
quality
of
our
pleasures
than
in
the
amount
on
the
other
hand
nature
punishes
any
neglect
of
prudence
if
you
think
the
senses
final
obey
their
law
if
you
believe
in
the
soul
do
not
clutch
at
sensual
sweetness
before
it
is
ripe
on
the
slow
tree
of
cause
and
effect
it
is
vinegar
to
the
eyes
to
deal
with
men
of
loose
and
imperfect
perception
johnson
is
reported
to
have
said
if
the
child
says
he
looked
out
of
this
window
when
he
looked
out
of
that
whip
him
our
american
character
is
marked
by
a
more
than
average
delight
in
accurate
perception
which
is
shown
by
the
currency
of
the
no
mistake
but
the
discomfort
of
unpunctuality
of
confusion
of
thought
about
facts
inattention
to
the
wants
of
is
of
no
nation
the
beautiful
laws
of
time
and
space
once
dislocated
by
our
inaptitude
are
holes
and
dens
if
the
hive
be
disturbed
by
rash
and
stupid
hands
instead
of
honey
it
will
yield
us
bees
our
words
and
actions
to
be
fair
must
be
timely
a
gay
and
pleasant
sound
is
the
whetting
of
the
scythe
in
the
mornings
of
june
yet
what
is
more
lonesome
and
sad
than
the
sound
of
a
whetstone
or
mower
rifle
when
it
is
too
late
in
the
season
to
make
hay
scatter
brained
and
afternoon
men
spoil
much
more
than
their
own
affairs
in
spoiling
the
temper
of
those
who
deal
with
them
i
have
seen
a
criticism
on
some
paintings
of
which
i
am
reminded
when
i
see
the
shiftless
and
unhappy
men
who
are
not
true
to
their
senses
the
last
grand
duke
of
weimar
a
man
of
superior
understanding
said
i
have
sometimes
remarked
in
the
presence
of
great
works
of
art
and
just
now
especially
in
dresden
how
much
a
certain
property
contributes
to
the
effect
which
gives
life
to
the
figures
and
to
the
life
an
irresistible
truth
this
property
is
the
hitting
in
all
the
figures
we
draw
the
right
centre
of
gravity
i
mean
the
placing
the
figures
firm
upon
their
feet
making
the
hands
grasp
and
fastening
the
eyes
on
the
spot
where
they
should
look
even
lifeless
figures
as
vessels
and
stools
let
them
be
drawn
ever
so
correctly
lose
all
effect
so
soon
as
they
lack
the
resting
upon
their
centre
of
gravity
and
have
a
certain
swimming
and
oscillating
appearance
the
raphael
in
the
dresden
gallery
the
only
great
affecting
picture
which
i
have
seen
is
the
quietest
and
most
passionless
piece
you
can
imagine
a
couple
of
saints
who
worship
the
virgin
and
child
nevertheless
it
awakens
a
deeper
impression
than
the
contortions
of
ten
crucified
martyrs
for
beside
all
the
resistless
beauty
of
form
it
possesses
in
the
highest
degree
the
property
of
the
perpendicularity
of
all
the
figures
this
perpendicularity
we
demand
of
all
the
figures
in
this
picture
of
life
let
them
stand
on
their
feet
and
not
float
and
swing
let
us
know
where
to
find
them
let
them
discriminate
between
what
they
remember
and
what
they
dreamed
let
them
call
a
spade
a
spade
let
them
give
us
facts
and
honor
their
own
senses
with
trust
but
what
man
shall
dare
task
another
with
imprudence
who
is
prudent
the
men
we
call
greatest
are
least
in
this
kingdom
there
is
a
certain
fatal
dislocation
in
our
relation
to
nature
distorting
all
our
modes
of
living
and
making
every
law
our
enemy
which
seems
at
last
to
have
aroused
all
the
wit
and
virtue
in
the
world
to
ponder
the
question
of
reform
we
must
call
the
highest
prudence
to
counsel
and
ask
why
health
and
beauty
and
genius
should
now
be
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
of
human
nature
we
do
not
know
the
properties
of
plants
and
animals
and
the
laws
of
nature
through
our
sympathy
with
the
same
but
this
remains
the
dream
of
poets
poetry
and
prudence
should
be
coincident
poets
should
be
lawgivers
that
is
the
boldest
lyric
inspiration
should
not
chide
and
insult
but
should
announce
and
lead
the
civil
code
and
the
day
work
but
now
the
two
things
seem
irreconcilably
parted
we
have
violated
law
upon
law
until
we
stand
amidst
ruins
and
when
by
chance
we
espy
a
coincidence
between
reason
and
the
phenomena
we
are
surprised
beauty
should
be
the
dowry
of
every
man
and
woman
as
invariably
as
sensation
but
it
is
rare
health
or
sound
organization
should
be
universal
genius
should
be
the
child
of
genius
and
every
child
should
be
inspired
but
now
it
is
not
to
be
predicted
of
any
child
and
nowhere
is
it
pure
we
call
partial
half
lights
by
courtesy
genius
talent
which
converts
itself
to
money
talent
which
glitters
that
it
may
dine
and
sleep
well
and
society
is
officered
by
of
as
they
are
properly
called
and
not
by
divine
men
these
use
their
gifts

not
to
abolish

and
piety
and
love
appetite
shows
to
the
finer
souls
as
a
disease
and
they
find
beauty
in
rites
and
bounds
that
resist
it
we
have
found
out
fine
names
to
cover
our
sensuality
withal
but
no
gifts
can
raise
intemperance
the
man
of
talent
affects
to
call
his
transgressions
of
the
laws
of
the
senses
trivial
and
to
count
them
nothing
considered
with
his
devotion
to
his
art
his
art
rebukes
him
that
never
taught
him
lewdness
nor
the
love
of
wine
nor
the
wish
to
reap
where
he
had
not
sowed
his
art
is
less
for
every
deduction
from
his
holiness
and
less
for
every
defect
of
common
sense
on
him
who
scorned
the
world
as
he
said
the
scorned
world
wreaks
its
revenge
he
that
despiseth
small
things
will
perish
by
little

little
goethe
tasso
is
very
likely
to
be
a
pretty
fair
historical
portrait
and
that
is
true
tragedy
it
does
not
seem
to
me
so
genuine
grief
when
some
tyrannous
richard
iii
oppresses
and
slays
a
score
of
innocent
persons
as
when
antonio
and
tasso
both
apparently
right
wrong
each
other
one
living
after
the
maxims
of
this
world
and
consistent
and
true
to
them
the
other
fired
with
all
divine
sentiments
yet
grasping
also
at
the
pleasures
of
sense
without
submitting
to
their
law
that
is
a
grief
we
all
feel
a
knot
we
can
not
untie
tasso
is
no
infrequent
case
in
modern
biography
a
man
of
genius
of
an
ardent
temperament
reckless
of
physical
laws
becomes
presently
unfortunate
querulous
a
discomfortable
cousin
a
thorn
to
himself
and
to
others
the
scholar
shames
us
by
his
bifold
life
whilst
something
higher
than
prudence
is
active
he
is
admirable
when
common
sense
is
wanted
he
is
an
encumbrance
yesterday
cæsar
was
not
so
great
job
not
so
miserable
yesterday
radiant
with
the
light
of
an
ideal
world
in
which
he
lives
the
first
of
men
and
now
oppressed
by
wants
and
by
sickness
for
which
he
must
thank
himself
none
is
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
he
resembles
the
opium
eaters
whom
travellers
describe
as
frequenting
the
bazaars
of
constantinople
who
skulk
about
all
day
the
most
pitiful
drivellers
yellow
emaciated
ragged
sneaking
then
at
evening
when
the
bazaars
are
open
they
slink
to
the
swallow
their
morsel
and
become
tranquil
glorious
and
great
and
who
has
not
seen
the
tragedy
of
imprudent
genius
struggling
for
years
with
paltry
pecuniary
difficulties
at
last
sinking
chilled
exhausted
and
fruitless
like
a
giant
slaughtered
by
pins
is
it
not
better
that
a
man
should
accept
the
first
pains
and
mortifications
of
this
sort
which
nature
is
not
slack
in
sending
him
as
hints
that
he
must
expect
no
other
good
than
the
just
fruit
of
his
own
labor
and
health
bread
climate
social
position
have
their
importance
and
he
will
give
them
their
due
let
him
esteem
nature
a
perpetual
counsellor
and
her
perfections
the
exact
measure
of
our
deviations
let
him
make
the
night
night
and
the
day
day
let
him
control
the
habit
of
expense
let
him
see
that
as
much
wisdom
may
be
expended
on
a
private
economy
as
on
an
empire
and
as
much
wisdom
may
be
drawn
from
it
the
laws
of
the
world
are
written
out
for
him
on
every
piece
of
money
in
his
hand
there
is
nothing
he
will
not
be
the
better
for
knowing
were
it
only
the
wisdom
of
poor
richard
or
the
prudence
of
buying
by
the
acre
to
sell
by
the
foot
or
the
thrift
of
the
agriculturist
to
stick
in
a
tree
between
whiles
because
it
will
grow
whilst
he
sleeps
or
the
prudence
which
consists
in
husbanding
little
strokes
of
the
tool
little
portions
of
time
particles
of
stock
and
small
gains
the
eye
of
prudence
may
never
shut
iron
if
kept
at
the
ironmonger
will
rust
beer
if
not
brewed
in
the
right
state
of
the
atmosphere
will
sour
timber
of
ships
will
rot
at
sea
or
if
laid
up
high
and
dry
will
strain
warp
and
money
if
kept
by
us
yields
no
rent
and
is
liable
to
loss
if
invested
is
liable
to
depreciation
of
the
particular
kind
of
stock
strike
says
the
smith
the

white
keep
the
rake
says
the
haymaker
as
nigh
the
scythe
as
you
can
and
the
cart
as
nigh
the
rake
our
yankee
trade
is
reputed
to
be
very
much
on
the
extreme
of
this
prudence
it
saves
itself
by
its
activity
it
takes
bank
notes
good
bad
clean
ragged
and
saves
itself
by
the
speed
with
which
it
passes
them
off
iron
can
not
rust
nor
beer
sour
nor
timber
rot
nor
calicoes
go
out
of
fashion
nor
money
stocks
depreciate
in
the
few
swift
moments
in
which
the
yankee
suffers
any
one
of
them
to
remain
in
his
possession
in
skating
over
thin
ice
our
safety
is
in
our
speed
let
him
learn
a
prudence
of
a
higher
strain
let
him
learn
that
everything
in
nature
even
motes
and
feathers
go
by
law
and
not
by
luck
and
that
what
he
sows
he
reaps
by
diligence
and
let
him
put
the
bread
he
eats
at
his
own
disposal
and
not
at
that
of
others
that
he
may
not
stand
in
bitter
and
false
relations
to
other
men
for
the
best
good
of
wealth
is
freedom
let
him
practise
the
minor
virtues
how
much
of
human
life
is
lost
in
waiting
let
him
not
make
his
fellow
creatures
wait
how
many
words
and
promises
are
promises
of
conversation
let
his
be
words
of
fate
when
he
sees
a
folded
and
sealed
scrap
of
paper
float
around
the
globe
in
a
pine
ship
and
come
safe
to
the
eye
for
which
it
was
written
amidst
a
swarming
population
let
him
likewise
feel
the
admonition
to
integrate
his
being
across
all
these
distracting
forces
and
keep
a
slender
human
word
among
the
storms
distances
and
accidents
that
drive
us
hither
and
thither
and
by
persistency
make
the
paltry
force
of
one
man
reappear
to
redeem
its
pledge
after
months
and
years
in
the
most
distant
climates
we
must
not
try
to
write
the
laws
of
any
one
virtue
looking
at
that
only
human
nature
loves
no
contradictions
but
is
symmetrical
the
prudence
which
secures
an
outward
is
not
to
be
studied
by
one
set
of
men
whilst
heroism
and
holiness
are
studied
by
another
but
they
are
reconcilable
prudence
concerns
the
present
time
persons
property
and
existing
forms
but
as
every
fact
hath
its
roots
in
the
soul
and
if
the
soul
were
changed
would
cease
to
be
or
would
become
some
other
thing
therefore
the
proper
administration
of
outward
things
will
always
rest
on
a
just
apprehension
of
their
cause
and
origin
that
is
the
good
man
will
be
the
wise
man
and
the
the
politic
man
every
violation
of
truth
is
not
only
a
sort
of
suicide
in
the
liar
but
is
a
stab
at
the
health
of
human
society
on
the
most
profitable
lie
the
course
of
events
presently
lays
a
destructive
tax
whilst
frankness
proves
to
be
the
best
tactics
for
it
invites
frankness
puts
the
parties
on
a
convenient
footing
and
makes
their
business
a
friendship
trust
men
and
they
will
be
true
to
you
treat
them
greatly
and
they
will
show
themselves
great
though
they
make
an
exception
in
your
favor
to
all
their
rules
of
trade
so
in
regard
to
disagreeable
and
formidable
things
prudence
does
not
consist
in
evasion
or
in
flight
but
in
courage
he
who
wishes
to
walk
in
the
most
peaceful
parts
of
life
with
any
serenity
must
screw
himself
up
to
resolution
let
him
front
the
object
of
his
worst
apprehension
and
his
stoutness
will
commonly
make
his
fears
groundless
the
latin
proverb
says
in
battles
the
eye
is
first
overcome
the
eye
is
daunted
and
greatly
exaggerates
the
perils
of
the
hour
entire
may
make
a
battle
very
little
more
dangerous
to
life
than
a
match
at
foils
or
at
football
examples
are
cited
by
soldiers
of
men
who
have
seen
the
cannon
pointed
and
the
fire
given
to
it
and
who
have
stepped
aside
from
the
path
of
the
ball
the
terrors
of
the
storm
are
chiefly
confined
to
the
parlor
and
the
cabin
the

the
sailor
buffets
it
all
day
and
his
health
renews
itself
at
as
vigorous
a
pulse
under
the
sleet
as
under
the
sun
of
june
in
the
occurrence
of
unpleasant
things
among
neighbors
fear
comes
readily
to
heart
and
magnifies
the
consequence
of
the
other
party
but
it
is
a
bad
counsellor
every
man
is
actually
weak
and
apparently
strong
to
himself
he
seems
weak
to
others
formidable
you
are
afraid
of
grim
but
grim
also
is
afraid
of
you
you
are
solicitous
of
the
good
will
of
the
meanest
person
uneasy
at
his
ill
will
but
the
sturdiest
offender
of
your
peace
and
of
the
neighborhood
if
you
rip
up
claims
is
as
thin
and
timid
as
any
and
the
peace
of
society
is
often
kept
because
as
children
say
one
is
afraid
and
the
other
dares
not
far
off
men
swell
bully
and
threaten
bring
them
hand
to
hand
and
they
are
a
feeble
folk
it
is
a
proverb
that
courtesy
costs
nothing
but
calculation
might
come
to
value
love
for
its
profit
love
is
fabled
to
be
blind
but
kindness
is
necessary
to
perception
love
is
not
a
hood
but
an
if
you
meet
a
sectary
or
a
hostile
partisan
never
recognize
the
dividing
lines
but
meet
on
what
common
ground
remains
if
only
that
the
sun
shines
and
the
rain
rains
for
both
the
area
will
widen
very
fast
and
ere
you
know
it
the
boundary
mountains
on
which
the
eye
had
fastened
have
melted
into
air
if
he
set
out
to
contend
almost
paul
will
lie
almost
john
will
hate
what
low
poor
paltry
hypocritical
people
an
argument
on
religion
will
make
of
the
pure
and
chosen
souls
shuffle
they
will
and
crow
crook
and
hide
feign
to
confess
here
only
that
they
may
brag
and
conquer
there
and
not
a
thought
has
enriched
either
party
and
not
an
emotion
of
bravery
modesty
or
hope
so
neither
should
you
put
yourself
in
a
false
position
to
your
contemporaries
by
indulging
a
vein
of
hostility
and
bitterness
though
your
views
are
in
straight
antagonism
to
theirs
assume
an
identity
of
sentiment
assume
that
you
are
saying
precisely
that
which
all
think
and
in
the
flow
of
wit
and
love
roll
out
your
paradoxes
in
solid
column
with
not
the
infirmity
of
a
doubt
so
at
least
shall
you
get
an
adequate
deliverance
the
natural
emotions
of
the
soul
are
so
much
better
than
the
voluntary
ones
that
you
will
never
do
yourself
justice
in
dispute
the
thought
is
not
then
taken
hold
of
by
the
right
handle
does
not
show
itself
proportioned
and
in
its
true
bearings
but
bears
extorted
hoarse
and
half
witness
but
assume
a
consent
and
it
shall
presently
be
granted
since
really
and
underneath
their
all
external
diversities
all
men
are
of
one
heart
and
mind
wisdom
will
never
let
us
stand
with
any
man
or
men
on
an
unfriendly
footing
we
refuse
sympathy
and
intimacy
with
people
as
if
we
waited
for
some
better
sympathy
and
intimacy
to
come
but
whence
and
when
will
be
like
life
wastes
itself
whilst
we
are
preparing
to
live
our
friends
and
die
off
from
us
scarcely
can
we
say
we
see
new
men
new
women
approaching
us
we
are
too
old
to
regard
fashion
too
old
to
expect
patronage
of
any
greater
or
more
powerful
let
us
suck
the
sweetness
of
those
affections
and
consuetudes
that
grow
near
us
these
old
shoes
are
easy
to
the
feet
undoubtedly
we
can
easily
pick
faults
in
our
company
can
easily
whisper
names
prouder
and
that
tickle
the
fancy
more
every
imagination
hath
its
friends
and
pleasant
would
life
be
with
such
companions
but
if
you
can
not
have
them
on
good
mutual
terms
you
can
not
have
them
if
not
the
deity
but
our
ambition
hews
and
shapes
the
new
relations
their
virtue
escapes
as
strawberries
lose
their
flavor
in
garden
beds
thus
truth
frankness
courage
love
humility
and
all
the
virtues
range
themselves
on
the
side
of
prudence
or
the
art
of
securing
a
present
i
do
not
know
if
all
matter
will
be
found
to
be
made
of
one
element
as
oxygen
or
hydrogen
at
last
but
the
world
of
manners
and
actions
is
wrought
of
one
stuff
and
begin
where
we
will
we
are
pretty
sure
in
a
short
space
to
be
mumbling
our
ten
commandments
circles
the
eye
is
the
first
circle
the
horizon
which
it
forms
is
the
second
and
throughout
nature
this
primary
picture
is
repeated
without
end
it
is
the
highest
emblem
in
the
cipher
of
the
world
augustine
described
the
nature
of
god
as
a
circle
whose
centre
was
everywhere
and
its
circumference
nowhere
we
are
all
our
lifetime
reading
the
copious
sense
of
this
first
of
forms
one
moral
we
have
already
deduced
in
considering
the
circular
or
compensatory
character
of
every
human
action
another
analogy
we
shall
now
trace
that
every
action
admits
of
being
outdone
our
life
is
an
apprenticeship
to
the
truth
that
around
every
circle
another
can
be
drawn
that
there
is
no
end
in
nature
but
every
end
is
a
beginning
that
there
is
always
another
dawn
risen
on
and
under
every
deep
a
lower
deep
opens
this
fact
as
far
as
it
symbolizes
the
moral
fact
of
the
unattainable
the
flying
perfect
around
which
the
hands
of
man
can
never
meet
at
once
the
inspirer
and
the
condemner
of
every
success
may
conveniently
serve
us
to
connect
many
illustrations
of
human
power
in
every
department
there
are
no
fixtures
in
nature
the
universe
is
fluid
and
volatile
permanence
is
but
a
word
of
degrees
our
globe
seen
by
god
is
a
transparent
law
not
a
mass
of
facts
the
law
dissolves
the
fact
and
holds
its
fluid
our
culture
is
the
predominance
of
an
idea
which
draws
after
it
all
this
train
of
cities
and
institutions
let
us
rise
into
another
idea
they
will
disappear
the
greek
sculpture
is
all
melted
away
as
if
it
had
been
statues
of
ice
here
and
there
a
solitary
figure
or
fragment
remaining
as
we
see
flecks
and
scraps
of
snow
left
in
cold
dells
and
mountain
clefts
in
june
and
july
for
the
genius
that
created
it
creates
now
somewhat
else
the
greek
letters
last
a
little
longer
but
are
already
passing
under
the
same
sentence
and
tumbling
into
the
inevitable
pit
which
the
creation
of
new
thought
opens
for
all
that
is
old
the
new
continents
are
built
out
of
the
ruins
of
an
old
planet
the
new
races
fed
out
of
the
decomposition
of
the
foregoing
new
arts
destroy
the
old
see
the
investment
of
capital
in
aqueducts
made
useless
by
hydraulics
fortifications
by
gunpowder
roads
and
canals
by
railways
sails
by
steam
steam
by
electricity
you
admire
this
tower
of
granite
weathering
the
hurts
of
so
many
ages
yet
a
little
waving
hand
built
this
huge
wall
and
that
which
builds
is
better
than
that
which
is
built
the
hand
that
built
can
topple
it
down
much
faster
better
than
the
hand
and
nimbler
was
the
invisible
thought
which
wrought
through
it
and
thus
ever
behind
the
coarse
effect
is
a
fine
cause
which
being
narrowly
seen
is
itself
the
effect
of
a
finer
cause
everything
looks
permanent
until
its
secret
is
known
a
rich
estate
appears
to
women
and
children
a
firm
and
lasting
fact
to
a
merchant
one
easily
created
out
of
any
materials
and
easily
lost
an
orchard
good
tillage
good
grounds
seem
a
fixture
like
a
gold
mine
or
a
river
to
a
citizen
but
to
a
large
farmer
not
much
more
fixed
than
the
state
of
the
crop
nature
looks
provokingly
stable
and
secular
but
it
has
a
cause
like
all
the
rest
and
when
once
i
comprehend
that
will
these
fields
stretch
so
immovably
wide
these
leaves
hang
so
individually
considerable
permanence
is
a
word
of
degrees
every
thing
is
medial
moons
are
no
more
bounds
to
spiritual
power
than
the
key
to
every
man
is
his
thought
sturdy
and
defying
though
he
look
he
has
a
helm
which
he
obeys
which
is
the
idea
after
which
all
his
facts
are
classified
he
can
only
be
reformed
by
showing
him
a
new
idea
which
commands
his
own
the
life
of
man
is
a
circle
which
from
a
ring
imperceptibly
small
rushes
on
all
sides
outwards
to
new
and
larger
circles
and
that
without
end
the
extent
to
which
this
generation
of
circles
wheel
without
wheel
will
go
depends
on
the
force
or
truth
of
the
individual
soul
for
it
is
the
inert
effort
of
each
thought
having
formed
itself
into
a
circular
wave
of
circumstance
as
for
instance
an
empire
rules
of
an
art
a
local
usage
a
religious
rite
to
heap
itself
on
that
ridge
and
to
solidify
and
hem
in
the
life
but
if
the
soul
is
quick
and
strong
it
bursts
over
that
boundary
on
all
sides
and
expands
another
orbit
on
the
great
deep
which
also
runs
up
into
a
high
wave
with
attempt
again
to
stop
and
to
bind
but
the
heart
refuses
to
be
imprisoned
in
its
first
and
narrowest
pulses
it
already
tends
outward
with
a
vast
force
and
to
immense
and
innumerable
expansions
every
ultimate
fact
is
only
the
first
of
a
new
series
every
general
law
only
a
particular
fact
of
some
more
general
law
presently
to
disclose
itself
there
is
no
outside
no
inclosing
wall
no
circumference
to
us
the
man
finishes
his
story
how
good
how
final
how
it
puts
a
new
face
on
all
things
he
fills
the
sky
lo
on
the
other
side
rises
also
a
man
and
draws
a
circle
around
the
circle
we
had
just
pronounced
the
outline
of
the
sphere
then
already
is
our
first
speaker
not
man
but
only
a
first
speaker
his
only
redress
is
forthwith
to
draw
a
circle
outside
of
his
antagonist
and
so
men
do
by
themselves
the
result
of
which
haunts
the
mind
and
can
not
be
escaped
will
presently
be
abridged
into
a
word
and
the
principle
that
seemed
to
explain
nature
will
itself
be
included
as
one
example
of
a
bolder
generalization
in
the
thought
of
there
is
a
power
to
upheave
all
thy
creed
all
the
creeds
all
the
literatures
of
the
nations
and
marshal
thee
to
a
heaven
which
no
epic
dream
has
yet
depicted
every
man
is
not
so
much
a
workman
in
the
world
as
he
is
a
suggestion
of
that
he
should
be
men
walk
as
prophecies
of
the
next
age
step
by
step
we
scale
this
mysterious
ladder
the
steps
are
actions
the
new
prospect
is
power
every
several
result
is
threatened
and
judged
by
that
which
follows
every
one
seems
to
be
contradicted
by
the
new
it
is
only
limited
by
the
new
the
new
statement
is
always
hated
by
the
old
and
to
those
dwelling
in
the
old
comes
like
an
abyss
of
scepticism
but
the
eye
soon
gets
wonted
to
it
for
the
eye
and
it
are
effects
of
one
cause
then
its
innocency
and
benefit
appear
and
presently
all
its
energy
spent
it
pales
and
dwindles
before
the
revelation
of
the
new
hour
fear
not
the
new
generalization
does
the
fact
look
crass
and
material
threatening
to
degrade
thy
theory
of
spirit
resist
it
not
it
goes
to
refine
and
raise
thy
theory
of
matter
just
as
much
there
are
no
fixtures
to
men
if
we
appeal
to
consciousness
every
man
supposes
himself
not
to
be
fully
understood
and
if
there
is
any
truth
in
him
if
he
rests
at
last
on
the
divine
soul
i
see
not
how
it
can
be
otherwise
the
last
chamber
the
last
closet
he
must
feel
was
never
opened
there
is
always
a
residuum
unknown
unanalyzable
that
is
every
man
believes
that
he
has
a
greater
possibility
our
moods
do
not
believe
in
each
other
i
am
full
of
thoughts
and
can
write
what
i
please
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
have
the
same
thought
the
same
power
of
expression
what
i
write
whilst
i
write
it
seems
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
yesterday
i
saw
a
dreary
vacuity
in
this
direction
in
which
now
i
see
so
much
and
a
month
hence
i
doubt
not
i
shall
wonder
who
he
was
that
wrote
so
many
continuous
pages
alas
for
this
infirm
faith
this
will
not
strenuous
this
vast
ebb
of
a
vast
flow
i
am
god
in
nature
i
am
a
weed
by
the
wall
the
continual
effort
to
raise
himself
above
himself
to
work
a
pitch
above
his
last
height
betrays
itself
in
a
man
relations
we
thirst
for
approbation
yet
can
not
forgive
the
approver
the
sweet
of
nature
is
love
yet
if
i
have
a
friend
i
am
tormented
by
my
imperfections
the
love
of
me
accuses
the
other
party
if
he
were
high
enough
to
slight
me
then
could
i
love
him
and
rise
by
my
affection
to
new
heights
a
man
growth
is
seen
in
the
successive
choirs
of
his
friends
for
every
friend
whom
he
loses
for
truth
he
gains
a
better
i
thought
as
i
walked
in
the
woods
and
mused
on
any
friends
why
should
i
play
with
them
this
game
of
idolatry
i
know
and
see
too
well
when
not
voluntarily
blind
the
speedy
limits
of
persons
called
high
and
worthy
rich
noble
and
great
they
are
by
the
liberality
of
our
speech
but
truth
is
sad
o
blessed
spirit
whom
i
forsake
for
these
they
are
not
thee
every
personal
consideration
that
we
allow
costs
us
heavenly
state
we
sell
the
thrones
of
angels
for
a
short
and
turbulent
pleasure
how
often
must
we
learn
this
lesson
men
cease
to
interest
us
when
we
find
their
limitations
the
only
sin
is
limitation
as
soon
as
you
once
come
up
with
a
man
limitations
it
is
all
over
with
him
has
he
talents
has
he
enterprises
has
he
knowledge
it
boots
not
infinitely
alluring
and
attractive
was
he
to
you
yesterday
a
great
hope
a
sea
to
swim
in
now
you
have
found
his
shores
found
it
a
pond
and
you
care
not
if
you
never
see
it
again
each
new
step
we
take
in
thought
reconciles
twenty
seemingly
discordant
facts
as
expressions
of
one
law
aristotle
and
plato
are
reckoned
the
respective
heads
of
two
schools
a
wise
man
will
see
that
aristotle
platonizes
by
going
one
step
farther
back
in
thought
discordant
opinions
are
reconciled
by
being
seen
to
be
two
extremes
of
one
principle
and
we
can
never
go
so
far
back
as
to
preclude
a
still
higher
vision
beware
when
the
great
god
lets
loose
a
thinker
on
this
planet
then
all
things
are
at
risk
it
is
as
when
a
conflagration
has
broken
out
in
a
great
city
and
no
man
knows
what
is
safe
or
where
it
will
end
there
is
not
a
piece
of
science
but
its
flank
may
be
turned
there
is
not
any
literary
reputation
not
the
eternal
names
of
fame
that
may
not
be
revised
and
condemned
the
very
hopes
of
man
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
the
religion
of
nations
the
manners
and
morals
of
mankind
are
all
at
the
mercy
of
a
new
generalization
generalization
is
always
a
new
influx
of
the
divinity
into
the
mind
hence
the
thrill
that
attends
it
valor
consists
in
the
power
of
so
that
a
man
can
not
have
his
flank
turned
can
not
be
but
put
him
where
you
will
he
stands
this
can
only
be
by
his
preferring
truth
to
his
past
apprehension
of
truth
and
his
alert
acceptance
of
it
from
whatever
quarter
the
intrepid
conviction
that
his
laws
his
relations
to
society
his
christianity
his
world
may
at
any
time
be
superseded
and
decease
there
are
degrees
in
idealism
we
learn
first
to
play
with
it
academically
as
the
magnet
was
once
a
toy
then
we
see
in
the
heyday
of
youth
and
poetry
that
it
may
be
true
that
it
is
true
in
gleams
and
fragments
then
its
countenance
waxes
stern
and
grand
and
we
see
that
it
must
be
true
it
now
shows
itself
ethical
and
practical
we
learn
that
god
is
that
he
is
in
me
and
that
all
things
are
shadows
of
him
the
idealism
of
berkeley
is
only
a
crude
statement
of
the
idealism
of
jesus
and
that
again
is
a
crude
statement
of
the
fact
that
all
nature
is
the
rapid
efflux
of
goodness
executing
and
organizing
itself
much
more
obviously
is
history
and
the
state
of
the
world
at
any
one
time
directly
dependent
on
the
intellectual
classification
then
existing
in
the
minds
of
men
the
things
which
are
dear
to
men
at
this
hour
are
so
on
account
of
the
ideas
which
have
emerged
on
their
mental
horizon
and
which
cause
the
present
order
of
things
as
a
tree
bears
its
apples
a
new
degree
of
culture
would
instantly
revolutionize
the
entire
system
of
human
pursuits
conversation
is
a
game
of
circles
in
conversation
we
pluck
up
the
which
bound
the
common
of
silence
on
every
side
the
parties
are
not
to
be
judged
by
the
spirit
they
partake
and
even
express
under
this
pentecost
they
will
have
receded
from
this
mark
you
shall
find
them
stooping
under
the
old
yet
let
us
enjoy
the
cloven
flame
whilst
it
glows
on
our
walls
when
each
new
speaker
strikes
a
new
light
emancipates
us
from
the
oppression
of
the
last
speaker
to
oppress
us
with
the
greatness
and
exclusiveness
of
his
own
thought
then
yields
us
to
another
redeemer
we
seem
to
recover
our
rights
to
become
men
o
what
truths
profound
and
executable
only
in
ages
and
orbs
are
supposed
in
the
announcement
of
every
truth
in
common
hours
society
sits
cold
and
statuesque
we
all
stand
waiting
empty
knowing
possibly
that
we
can
be
full
surrounded
by
mighty
symbols
which
are
not
symbols
to
us
but
prose
and
trivial
toys
then
cometh
the
god
and
converts
the
statues
into
fiery
men
and
by
a
flash
of
his
eye
burns
up
the
veil
which
shrouded
all
things
and
the
meaning
of
the
very
furniture
of
cup
and
saucer
of
chair
and
clock
and
tester
is
manifest
the
facts
which
loomed
so
large
in
the
fogs
of
yesterday
property
climate
breeding
personal
beauty
and
the
like
have
strangely
changed
their
proportions
all
that
we
reckoned
settled
shakes
and
rattles
and
literatures
cities
climates
religions
leave
their
foundations
and
dance
before
our
eyes
and
yet
here
again
see
the
swift
circumscription
good
as
is
discourse
silence
is
better
and
shames
it
the
length
of
the
discourse
indicates
the
distance
of
thought
betwixt
the
speaker
and
the
hearer
if
they
were
at
a
perfect
understanding
in
any
part
no
words
would
be
necessary
thereon
if
at
one
in
all
parts
no
words
would
be
suffered
literature
is
a
point
outside
of
our
hodiernal
circle
through
which
a
new
one
may
be
described
the
use
of
literature
is
to
afford
us
a
platform
whence
we
may
command
a
view
of
our
present
life
a
purchase
by
which
we
may
move
it
we
fill
ourselves
with
ancient
learning
install
ourselves
the
best
we
can
in
greek
in
punic
in
roman
houses
only
that
we
may
wiselier
see
french
english
and
american
houses
and
modes
of
living
in
like
manner
we
see
literature
best
from
the
midst
of
wild
nature
or
from
the
din
of
affairs
or
from
a
high
religion
the
field
can
not
be
well
seen
from
within
the
field
the
astronomer
must
have
his
diameter
of
the
orbit
as
a
base
to
find
the
parallax
of
any
star
therefore
we
value
the
poet
all
the
argument
and
all
the
wisdom
is
not
in
the
encyclopædia
or
the
treatise
on
metaphysics
or
the
body
of
divinity
but
in
the
sonnet
or
the
play
in
my
daily
work
i
incline
to
repeat
my
old
steps
and
do
not
believe
in
remedial
force
in
the
power
of
change
and
reform
but
some
petrarch
or
ariosto
filled
with
the
new
wine
of
his
imagination
writes
me
an
ode
or
a
brisk
romance
full
of
daring
thought
and
action
he
smites
and
arouses
me
with
his
shrill
tones
breaks
up
my
whole
chain
of
habits
and
i
open
my
eye
on
my
own
possibilities
he
claps
wings
to
the
sides
of
all
the
solid
old
lumber
of
the
world
and
i
am
capable
once
more
of
choosing
a
straight
path
in
theory
and
practice
we
have
the
same
need
to
command
a
view
of
the
religion
of
the
world
we
can
never
see
christianity
from
the
catechism
from
the
pastures
from
a
boat
in
the
pond
from
amidst
the
songs
of
we
possibly
may
cleansed
by
the
elemental
light
and
wind
steeped
in
the
sea
of
beautiful
forms
which
the
field
offers
us
we
may
chance
to
cast
a
right
glance
back
upon
biography
christianity
is
rightly
dear
to
the
best
of
mankind
yet
was
there
never
a
young
philosopher
whose
breeding
had
fallen
into
the
christian
church
by
whom
that
brave
text
of
paul
was
not
specially
prized
then
shall
also
the
son
be
subject
unto
him
who
put
all
things
under
him
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
let
the
claims
and
virtues
of
persons
be
never
so
great
and
welcome
the
instinct
of
man
presses
eagerly
onward
to
the
impersonal
and
illimitable
and
gladly
arms
itself
against
the
dogmatism
of
bigots
with
this
generous
word
out
of
the
book
itself
the
natural
world
may
be
conceived
of
as
a
system
of
concentric
circles
and
we
now
and
then
detect
in
nature
slight
dislocations
which
apprize
us
that
this
surface
on
which
we
now
stand
is
not
fixed
but
sliding
these
manifold
tenacious
qualities
this
chemistry
and
vegetation
these
metals
and
animals
which
seem
to
stand
there
for
their
own
sake
are
means
and
methods
only
are
words
of
god
and
as
fugitive
as
other
words
has
the
naturalist
or
chemist
learned
his
craft
who
has
explored
the
gravity
of
atoms
and
the
elective
affinities
who
has
not
yet
discerned
the
deeper
law
whereof
this
is
only
a
partial
or
approximate
statement
namely
that
like
draws
to
like
and
that
the
goods
which
belong
to
you
gravitate
to
you
and
need
not
be
pursued
with
pains
and
cost
yet
is
that
statement
approximate
also
and
not
final
omnipresence
is
a
higher
fact
not
through
subtle
subterranean
channels
need
friend
and
fact
be
drawn
to
their
counterpart
but
rightly
considered
these
things
proceed
from
the
eternal
generation
of
the
soul
cause
and
effect
are
two
sides
of
one
fact
the
same
law
of
eternal
procession
ranges
all
that
we
call
the
virtues
and
extinguishes
each
in
the
light
of
a
better
the
great
man
will
not
be
prudent
in
the
popular
sense
all
his
prudence
will
be
so
much
deduction
from
his
grandeur
but
it
behooves
each
to
see
when
he
sacrifices
prudence
to
what
god
he
devotes
it
if
to
ease
and
pleasure
he
had
better
be
prudent
still
if
to
a
great
trust
he
can
well
spare
his
mule
and
panniers
who
has
a
winged
chariot
instead
geoffrey
draws
on
his
boots
to
go
through
the
woods
that
his
feet
may
be
safer
from
the
bite
of
snakes
aaron
never
thinks
of
such
a
peril
in
many
years
neither
is
harmed
by
such
an
accident
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
with
every
precaution
you
take
against
such
an
evil
you
put
yourself
into
the
power
of
the
evil
i
suppose
that
the
highest
prudence
is
the
lowest
prudence
is
this
too
sudden
a
rushing
from
the
centre
to
the
verge
of
our
orbit
think
how
many
times
we
shall
fall
back
into
pitiful
calculations
before
we
take
up
our
rest
in
the
great
sentiment
or
make
the

one
man

justice
consists
in
paying
debts
and
has
no

in
his
abhorrence
of
another
who
is
very
remiss
in
this
duty
and
makes
the
creditor
wait
tediously

that
second
man
has
his
own
way
of
looking
at
things
asks
himself
which
debt
must
i
pay
first
the
debt
to
the
rich
or
the
debt
to
the
poor
the
debt
of
money
or
the
debt
of
thought
to
mankind
of
genius
to
nature

you
o

no

commerce

of

i
detach
one

you
from
all
other
duties
and
concentrate
my
forces
mechanically
on
the
payment
of
moneys
let
me
live
onward
you
shall
find
that
though
slower
the
progress
of
my
character
will
liquidate
all
these
debts
without
injustice
to
higher
claims
if
a
man
should
dedicate
himself
to
the
payment
of
notes
would
not
this
be
injustice
owes
he
no
debt
but
money
and
are
all
claims
on
him
to
be
postponed
to
a

a
banker
there
is
no
virtue
which
is
final

initial

terror

reform
is
the
discovery
that
we
must
cast
away
our
virtues
or
what
we
have
always
esteemed
such
into
the
same
pit
that
has
consumed
our
grosser
vices

his
crimes
forgive
his

those
smaller
faults
half
converts
to
the
right
it
is
the
highest
power
of
divine
moments
that
they
abolish
our
contritions
also
i
accuse
myself
of
sloth
and
unprofitableness
day
by
day
but
when
these
waves
of
god
flow
into
me
i
no
longer
reckon
lost
time
i
no

compute
my
possible
achievement

what
remains

of
omnipresence
and
omnipotence
which
asks
nothing
of
duration
but
sees
that
the
energy
of
the
mind
is
commensurate
with
the
work
to
be
done
without
time
and
thus
o
circular
philosopher
i
hear
some
reader
exclaim
you
have
arrived
at
a
fine
pyrrhonism
at
an
equivalence
and
indifferency
of
all
actions
and
would
fain
teach
us
that

are
forsooth

be
lively

careful
to
justify
myself
i
own
i
am
gladdened
by
seeing
the
predominance
of
the
saccharine
principle
throughout
vegetable
nature
and
not
less
by
beholding
in
morals
that
unrestrained
inundation
of
the
principle
of
good
into
every
chink
and
hole
that
selfishness
has
left
open

into
selfishness
and
sin
itself
so
that
no
evil
is
pure
nor
hell
itself
without
its
extreme
satisfactions
but
lest
i
should
mislead
any
when
i
have
my
own
head
and
obey
my
whims
let
me
remind
the
reader
that
i
am
only
an
experimenter
do
not
set
the
least
value
on
what
i
do
or
the

discredit
on
what
i
do
not
as
if
i
pretended
to
settle
anything
as
true
or
false
i
unsettle
all
things
no
facts
are
to
me
sacred
none
are
profane
i
simply
experiment
an
endless
seeker
with
no
past
at
my
back
yet
this
incessant
movement
and
progression
which
all
things
partake
could
never
become
sensible
to
us
but
by
contrast
to
some
principle
of
fixture
or
stability
in
the
soul
whilst
the
eternal
generation
of
circles
proceeds
the
eternal
generator
abides
that
central
life
is
somewhat
superior
to
creation
superior
to
knowledge
and
thought
and
contains
all
its
circles
for
ever
it
labors
to
create
a
life
and
thought
as
large
and
excellent

itself

in

that
which

how
to
make
a
better
thus
there
is
no
sleep
no
pause
no
preservation
but
all

renew

spring
why
should
we
import
rags
and

simplest
words
we
do
not
know
what
they

except
when

the
difference
between

keep
the

trodden

power

courage

make

making
them
see
that
much
is
possible

particular
events

do
not

much

any
one
battle

success

see
that
we

exaggerated

was
easy
to
him

great
man
is
not
convulsible
or
tormentable

is
so
much

events
pass
over
him
without
much
impression

say
sometimes
see
what
i
have
overcome
see
how
cheerful
i
am
see
how
completely
i
have
triumphed
over
these
black
events
not
if
they
still
remind
me
of
the
black
event
they
have
not
yet
conquered
is
it
conquest
to
be
a
gay

decorated
sepulchre
or

hysterically

true
conquest
is
the
causing
the
black
event
to
fade
and
disappear
as
an
early
cloud
of
insignificant
result
in
a
history
so
large
and
advancing
the
one
thing
which
we
seek
with
insatiable
desire
is
to
forget
ourselves
to
be
surprised
out
of
our
propriety
to
lose
our
sempiternal
memory
and
to
do
something
without
knowing
how
or
why
in

draw
a
new
circle
nothing
great
was
ever
achieved
without
enthusiasm
