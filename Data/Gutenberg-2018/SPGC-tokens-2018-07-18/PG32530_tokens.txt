armageddon
philip
francis
once
more
is
a
real
scientifiction
story
plus
it
is
a
story
which
will
make
the
heart
of
many
readers
leap
with
have
rarely
printed
a
story
in
this
magazine
that
for
scientific
interest
as
well
as
suspense
could
hold
its
own
with
this
particular
story
we
prophesy
that
this
story
will
become
more
valuable
as
the
years
go
by
it
certainly
holds
a
number
of
interesting
prophecies
of
which
no
doubt
many
will
come
true
for
wealth
of
science
it
will
be
hard
to
beat
for
some
time
to
come
it
is
one
of
those
rare
stories
that
will
bear
reading
and
many
story
has
impressed
us
so
favorably
that
we
hope
the
author
may
be
induced
to
write
a
sequel
to
it
foreword
elsewhere
i
have
set
down
for
whatever
interest
they
have
in
this
the
century
my
personal
recollections
of
the
century
now
it
occurs
to
me
that
my
memoirs
of
the
century
may
have
an
equal
interest
years
from
now
particularly
in
view
of
that
unique
perspective
from
which
i
have
seen
the
century
entering
it
as
i
did
in
one
leap
across
a
gap
of
years
this
statement
requires
elucidation
there
are
still
many
in
the
world
who
are
not
familiar
with
my
unique
experience
five
centuries
from
now
there
may
be
many
more
especially
if
civilization
is
fated
to
endure
any
worse
convulsions
than
those
which
have
occurred
between
and
the
present
time
i
should
state
therefore
that
i
anthony
rogers
am
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
man
alive
whose
normal
span
of
years
of
life
has
been
spread
over
a
period
of
years
to
be
precise
i
lived
the
first
years
of
my
life
between
and
the
other
since
the
gap
between
these
two
a
period
of
nearly
five
hundred
years
i
spent
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
free
from
the
ravages
of
katabolic
processes
and
without
any
apparent
effect
on
my
physical
or
mental
faculties
when
i
began
my
long
sleep
man
had
just
begun
his
real
conquest
of
the
air
in
a
sudden
series
of
transoceanic
flights
in
airplanes
driven
by
internal
combustion
motors
he
had
barely
begun
to
speculate
on
the
possibilities
of
harnessing
forces
and
had
made
no
further
practical
penetration
into
the
field
of
ethereal
pulsations
than
the
primitive
radio
and
television
of
that
day
the
united
states
of
america
was
the
most
powerful
nation
in
the
world
its
political
financial
industrial
and
scientific
influence
being
supreme
and
in
the
arts
also
it
was
rapidly
climbing
into
leadership
i
awoke
to
find
the
america
i
knew
a
total
wreck
to
find
americans
a
hunted
race
in
their
own
land
hiding
in
the
dense
forests
that
covered
the
shattered
and
leveled
ruins
of
their
once
magnificent
cities
desperately
preserving
and
struggling
to
develop
in
their
secret
retreats
the
remnants
of
their
culture
and
science
and
the
undying
flame
of
their
sturdy
independence
world
domination
was
in
the
hands
of
mongolians
and
the
center
of
world
power
lay
in
inland
china
with
americans
one
of
the
few
races
of
mankind
unsubdued
and
it
must
be
admitted
in
fairness
to
the
truth
not
worth
the
trouble
of
subduing
in
the
eyes
of
the
han
airlords
who
ruled
north
america
as
titular
tributaries
of
the
most
magnificent
for
they
needed
not
the
forests
in
which
the
americans
lived
nor
the
resources
of
the
vast
territories
these
forests
covered
with
the
perfection
to
which
they
had
reduced
the
synthetic
production
of
necessities
and
luxuries
their
remarkable
development
of
scientific
processes
and
mechanical
accomplishment
of
work
they
had
no
economic
need
for
the
forests
and
no
economic
desire
for
the
enslaved
labor
of
an
unruly
race
they
had
all
they
needed
for
their
magnificently
luxurious
and
degraded
scheme
of
civilization
within
the
walls
of
the
fifteen
cities
of
sparkling
glass
they
had
flung
skyward
on
the
sites
of
ancient
american
centers
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
underneath
them
and
with
relatively
small
surrounding
areas
of
agriculture
complete
domination
of
the
air
rendered
communication
between
these
centers
a
matter
of
ease
and
safety
occasional
destructive
raids
on
the
waste
lands
were
considered
all
that
was
necessary
to
keep
the
wild
americans
on
the
run
within
the
shelter
of
their
forests
and
prevent
their
becoming
a
menace
to
the
han
civilization
but
nearly
three
hundred
years
of
easily
maintained
security
the
last
century
of
which
had
been
nearly
sterile
in
scientific
social
and
economic
progress
had
softened
and
devitalized
the
hans
it
had
likewise
developed
beneath
the
protecting
foliage
of
the
forest
the
growth
of
a
vigorous
new
american
civilization
remarkable
in
the
mobility
and
flexibility
of
its
organization
in
its
conquest
of
almost
insuperable
obstacles
in
the
development
and
guarding
of
its
industrial
and
scientific
resources
all
in
anticipation
of
that
day
of
hope
to
which
it
had
been
looking
forward
for
generations
when
it
would
be
strong
enough
to
burst
from
the
green
chrysalis
of
the
forests
soar
into
the
upper
air
lanes
and
destroy
the
yellow
incubus
at
the
time
i
awoke
the
day
of
hope
was
almost
at
hand
i
shall
not
attempt
to
set
forth
a
detailed
history
of
the
second
war
of
independence
for
that
has
been
recorded
already
by
better
historians
than
i
am
instead
i
shall
confine
myself
largely
to
the
part
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
play
in
this
struggle
and
in
the
events
leading
up
to
it
illustration
seen
upon
the
ultroscope
viewplate
the
battle
looked
as
though
it
were
being
fought
in
daylight
perhaps
on
a
cloudy
day
while
the
explosions
of
the
rockets
appeared
as
flashes
of
extra
brilliance
it
all
resulted
from
my
interest
in
radioactive
gases
during
the
latter
part
of
my
company
the
american
radioactive
gas
corporation
had
been
keeping
me
busy
investigating
reports
of
unusual
phenomena
observed
in
certain
abandoned
coal
mines
near
the
wyoming
valley
in
pennsylvania
with
two
assistants
and
a
complete
equipment
of
scientific
instruments
i
began
the
exploration
of
a
deserted
working
in
a
mountainous
district
where
several
weeks
before
a
number
of
mining
engineers
had
reported
traces
of
carnotite
and
what
they
believed
to
be
radioactive
gases
their
report
was
not
without
foundation
it
was
apparent
from
the
outset
for
in
our
examination
of
the
upper
levels
of
the
mine
our
instruments
indicated
a
vigorous
radioactivity
a
hydrovanadate
of
uranium
and
other
metals
used
as
a
source
of
radium
compounds
on
the
morning
of
december
we
descended
to
one
of
the
lowest
levels
to
our
surprise
we
found
no
water
there
obviously
it
had
drained
off
through
some
break
in
the
strata
we
noticed
too
that
the
rock
in
the
side
walls
of
the
shaft
was
soft
evidently
due
to
the
radioactivity
and
pieces
crumbled
under
foot
rather
easily
we
made
our
way
cautiously
down
the
shaft
when
suddenly
the
rotted
timbers
above
us
gave
way
i
jumped
ahead
barely
escaping
the
avalanche
of
coal
and
soft
rock
but
my
companions
who
were
several
paces
behind
me
were
buried
under
it
and
undoubtedly
met
instant
death
i
was
trapped
return
was
impossible
with
my
electric
torch
i
explored
the
shaft
to
its
end
but
could
find
no
other
way
out
the
air
became
increasingly
difficult
to
breathe
probably
from
the
rapid
accumulation
of
the
radioactive
gas
in
a
little
while
my
senses
reeled
and
i
lost
consciousness
when
i
awoke
there
was
a
cool
and
refreshing
circulation
of
air
in
the
shaft
i
had
no
thought
that
i
had
been
unconscious
more
than
a
few
hours
although
it
seems
that
the
radioactive
gas
had
kept
me
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
for
something
like
years
my
awakening
i
figured
out
later
had
been
due
to
some
shifting
of
the
strata
which
reopened
the
shaft
and
cleared
the
atmosphere
in
the
working
this
must
have
been
the
case
for
i
was
able
to
struggle
back
up
the
shaft
over
a
pile
of
debris
and
stagger
up
the
long
incline
to
the
mouth
of
the
mine
where
an
entirely
different
world
overgrown
with
a
vast
forest
and
no
visible
sign
of
human
habitation
met
my
eyes
i
shall
pass
over
the
days
of
mental
agony
that
followed
in
my
attempt
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
it
all
there
were
times
when
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
verge
of
insanity
i
roamed
the
unfamiliar
forest
like
a
lost
soul
had
it
not
been
for
the
necessity
of
improvising
traps
and
crude
clubs
with
which
to
slay
my
food
i
believe
i
should
have
gone
mad
suffice
it
to
say
however
that
i
survived
this
psychic
crisis
i
shall
begin
my
narrative
proper
with
my
first
contact
with
americans
of
the
year
chapter
i
floating
men
my
first
glimpse
of
a
human
being
of
the
century
was
obtained
through
a
portion
of
woodland
where
the
trees
were
thinly
scattered
with
a
dense
forest
beyond
i
had
been
wandering
along
aimlessly
and
hopelessly
musing
over
my
strange
fate
when
i
noticed
a
figure
that
cautiously
backed
out
of
the
dense
growth
across
the
glade
i
was
about
to
call
out
joyfully
but
there
was
something
furtive
about
the
figure
that
prevented
me
the
boy
attention
for
it
seemed
to
be
a
lad
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
was
centered
tensely
on
the
heavy
growth
of
trees
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
he
was
clad
in
rather
garments
entirely
of
green
and
wore
a
cap
of
the
same
color
high
around
his
waist
he
wore
a
broad
thick
belt
which
bulked
up
in
the
back
across
the
shoulders
into
something
of
the
proportions
of
a
knapsack
as
i
was
taking
in
these
details
there
came
a
vivid
flash
and
heavy
detonation
like
that
of
a
hand
grenade
not
far
to
the
left
of
him
he
threw
up
an
arm
and
staggered
a
bit
in
a
queer
gliding
way
then
he
recovered
himself
and
slipped
cautiously
away
from
the
place
of
the
explosion
crouching
slightly
and
still
facing
the
denser
part
of
the
forest
every
few
steps
he
would
raise
his
arm
and
point
into
the
forest
with
something
he
held
in
his
hand
wherever
he
pointed
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
deeper
in
among
the
trees
it
came
to
me
then
that
he
was
shooting
with
some
form
of
pistol
though
there
was
neither
flash
nor
detonation
from
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
itself
after
firing
several
times
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
sudden
resolution
and
turning
in
my
general
direction
leaped
to
my
amazement
sailing
through
the
air
between
the
sparsely
scattered
trees
in
such
a
jump
as
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
before
that
leap
must
have
carried
him
a
full
fifty
feet
although
at
the
height
of
his
arc
he
was
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
when
he
alighted
his
foot
caught
in
a
projecting
root
and
he
sprawled
gently
forward
i
say
gently
for
he
did
not
crash
down
as
i
expected
him
to
do
the
only
thing
i
could
compare
it
with
was
a
cinema
although
i
had
never
seen
one
in
which
horizontal
motions
were
registered
at
normal
speed
and
only
the
vertical
movements
were
slowed
down
due
to
my
surprise
i
suppose
my
brain
did
not
function
with
its
normal
quickness
for
i
gazed
at
the
prone
figure
for
several
seconds
before
i
saw
the
blood
that
oozed
out
from
under
the
tight
green
cap
regaining
my
power
of
action
i
dragged
him
out
of
sight
back
of
the
big
tree
for
a
few
moments
i
busied
myself
in
an
attempt
to
staunch
the
flow
of
blood
the
wound
was
not
a
deep
one
my
companion
was
more
dazed
than
hurt
but
what
of
the
pursuers
i
took
the
weapon
from
his
grasp
and
examined
it
hurriedly
it
was
not
unlike
the
automatic
pistol
to
which
i
was
accustomed
except
that
it
apparently
fired
with
a
button
instead
of
a
trigger
i
inserted
several
fresh
rounds
of
ammunition
into
its
magazine
from
my
companion
belt
as
rapidly
as
i
could
for
i
soon
heard
near
us
the
suppressed
conversation
of
his
pursuers
there
followed
a
series
of
explosions
round
about
us
but
none
very
close
they
evidently
had
not
spotted
our
hiding
place
and
were
firing
at
random
i
waited
tensely
balancing
the
gun
in
my
hand
to
accustom
myself
to
its
weight
and
probable
throw
then
i
saw
a
movement
in
the
green
foliage
of
a
tree
not
far
away
and
the
head
and
face
of
a
man
appeared
like
my
companion
he
was
clad
entirely
in
green
which
made
his
figure
difficult
to
distinguish
but
his
face
could
be
seen
clearly
it
was
an
evil
face
and
had
murder
in
it
that
decided
me
i
raised
the
gun
and
fired
my
aim
was
bad
for
there
was
no
kick
in
the
gun
as
i
had
expected
and
i
hit
the
trunk
of
the
tree
several
feet
below
him
it
blew
him
from
his
perch
like
a
crumpled
bit
of
paper
and
he
down
to
the
ground
like
some
limp
dead
thing
gently
lowered
by
an
invisible
hand
the
tree
its
trunk
blown
apart
by
the
explosion
crashed
down
there
followed
another
series
of
explosions
around
us
these
guns
we
were
using
made
no
sound
in
the
firing
and
my
opponents
were
evidently
as
much
at
sea
as
to
my
position
as
i
was
to
theirs
so
i
made
no
attempt
to
reply
to
their
fire
contenting
myself
with
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
in
their
general
direction
and
patience
had
its
reward
very
soon
i
saw
a
cautious
movement
in
the
top
of
another
tree
exposing
myself
as
little
as
possible
i
aimed
carefully
at
the
tree
trunk
and
fired
again
a
shriek
followed
the
explosion
i
heard
the
tree
crash
down
then
a
groan
there
was
silence
for
a
while
then
i
heard
a
faint
sound
of
boughs
swishing
i
shot
three
times
in
its
direction
pressing
the
button
as
rapidly
as
i
could
branches
crashed
down
where
my
shells
had
exploded
but
there
was
no
body
then
i
saw
one
of
them
he
was
starting
one
of
those
amazing
leaps
from
the
bough
of
one
tree
to
another
about
forty
feet
away
i
threw
up
my
gun
impulsively
and
fired
by
now
i
had
gotten
the
feel
of
the
weapon
and
my
aim
was
good
i
hit
him
the
bullet
must
have
penetrated
his
body
and
exploded
for
one
moment
i
saw
him
flying
through
the
air
then
the
explosion
and
he
had
vanished
he
never
finished
his
leap
it
was
annihilation
how
many
more
of
them
there
were
i
do
know
but
this
must
have
been
too
much
for
them
they
used
a
final
round
of
shells
on
us
all
of
which
exploded
harmlessly
and
shortly
after
i
heard
them
swishing
and
crashing
away
from
us
through
the
tree
tops
not
one
of
them
descended
to
earth
now
i
had
time
to
give
some
attention
to
my
companion
she
was
i
found
a
girl
and
not
a
boy
despite
her
bulky
appearance
due
to
the
peculiar
belt
strapped
around
her
body
high
up
under
the
arms
she
was
very
slender
and
very
pretty
there
was
a
stream
not
far
away
from
which
i
brought
water
and
bathed
her
face
and
wound
apparently
the
mystery
of
these
long
leaps
the
ability
to
jump
from
bough
to
bough
and
of
the
bodies
that
floated
gently
down
instead
of
falling
lay
in
the
belt
the
thing
was
some
sort
of
belt
that
almost
balanced
the
weight
of
the
wearer
thereby
tremendously
multiplying
the
propulsive
power
of
the
leg
muscles
and
the
lifting
power
of
the
arms
when
the
girl
came
to
she
regarded
me
as
curiously
as
i
did
her
and
promptly
began
to
quiz
me
her
accent
and
intonation
puzzled
me
a
lot
but
nevertheless
we
were
able
to
understand
each
other
fairly
well
except
for
certain
words
and
phrases
i
explained
what
had
happened
while
she
lay
unconscious
and
she
thanked
me
simply
for
saving
her
life
you
are
a
strange
exchange
she
said
eying
my
clothing
quizzically
evidently
she
found
it
mirth
provoking
by
contrast
with
her
own
neatly
efficient
garb
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
by
i
mean
ah
let
me
see
a
stranger
somebody
from
some
other
gang
what
gang
do
you
belong
to
she
pronounced
it
gan
with
only
a
suspicion
of
a
nasal
sound
i
laughed
i
not
a
gangster
i
said
but
she
evidently
did
not
understand
this
word
i
do
belong
to
any
gang
i
explained
and
never
did
does
everybody
belong
to
a
gang
nowadays
naturally
she
said
frowning
if
you
do
belong
to
a
gang
where
and
how
do
you
live
why
have
you
not
found
and
joined
a
gang
how
do
you
eat
where
do
you
get
your
clothing
i
been
eating
wild
game
for
the
past
two
weeks
i
explained
and
this
clothing
i
er
ah
i
paused
wondering
how
i
could
explain
that
it
must
be
many
hundred
years
old
in
the
end
i
saw
i
would
have
to
tell
my
story
as
well
as
i
could
piecing
it
together
with
my
assumptions
as
to
what
had
happened
she
listened
patiently
incredulously
at
first
but
with
more
confidence
as
i
went
on
when
i
had
finished
she
sat
thinking
for
a
long
time
that
hard
to
believe
she
said
but
i
believe
it
she
looked
me
over
with
frank
interest
were
you
married
when
you
slipped
into
unconsciousness
down
in
that
mine
she
asked
me
suddenly
i
assured
her
i
had
never
married
well
that
simplifies
matters
she
continued
you
see
if
you
were
technically
classed
as
a
family
man
i
could
take
you
back
only
as
an
invited
exchange
and
i
being
unmarried
and
no
relation
of
yours
could
do
the
inviting
chapter
ii
the
forest
gangs
she
gave
me
a
brief
outline
of
the
very
peculiar
social
and
economic
system
under
which
her
people
lived
at
least
it
seemed
very
peculiar
from
my
century
viewpoint
i
learned
with
amazement
that
exactly
years
had
passed
over
my
head
as
i
lay
unconscious
in
the
mine
wilma
for
that
was
her
name
did
not
profess
to
be
a
historian
and
so
could
give
me
only
a
sketchy
outline
of
the
wars
that
had
been
fought
and
the
manner
in
which
such
radical
changes
had
come
about
it
seemed
that
another
war
had
followed
the
first
world
war
in
which
nearly
all
the
european
nations
had
banded
together
to
break
the
financial
and
industrial
power
of
america
they
succeeded
in
their
purpose
though
they
were
beaten
for
the
war
was
a
terrific
one
and
left
america
like
themselves
gasping
bleeding
and
disorganized
with
only
the
hollow
shell
of
a
victory
this
opportunity
had
been
seized
by
the
russian
soviets
who
had
made
a
coalition
with
the
chinese
to
sweep
over
all
europe
and
reduce
it
to
a
state
of
chaos
america
industrially
geared
to
world
production
and
the
world
trade
collapsed
economically
and
there
ensued
a
long
period
of
stagnation
and
desperate
attempts
at
economic
reconstruction
but
it
was
impossible
to
stave
off
war
with
the
mongolians
who
by
now
had
subjugated
the
russians
and
were
aiming
at
a
world
empire
in
about
it
seems
the
conflict
was
finally
precipitated
the
mongolians
with
overwhelming
fleets
of
great
airships
and
a
science
that
far
outstripped
that
of
crippled
america
swept
in
over
the
pacific
and
atlantic
coasts
and
down
from
canada
annihilating
american
aircraft
armies
and
cities
with
their
terrific
rays
these
rays
were
projected
from
a
machine
not
unlike
a
searchlight
in
appearance
the
reflector
of
which
however
was
not
material
substance
but
a
complicated
balance
of
interacting
electronic
forces
this
resulted
in
a
terribly
destructive
beam
under
its
influence
material
substance
melted
into
nothingness
into
electronic
vibrations
it
destroyed
all
then
known
substances
from
air
to
the
most
dense
metals
and
stone
they
settled
down
to
the
establishment
of
what
became
known
as
the
han
dynasty
in
america
as
a
sort
of
province
in
their
world
empire
those
were
terrible
days
for
the
americans
they
were
hunted
like
wild
beasts
only
those
survived
who
finally
found
refuge
in
mountains
canyons
and
forests
government
was
at
an
end
among
them
anarchy
prevailed
for
several
generations
most
would
have
been
eager
to
submit
to
the
hans
even
if
it
meant
slavery
but
the
hans
did
not
want
them
for
they
themselves
had
marvelous
machinery
and
scientific
process
by
which
all
difficult
labor
was
accomplished
ultimately
they
stopped
their
active
search
for
and
annihilation
of
the
widely
scattered
groups
of
now
savage
americans
so
long
as
they
remained
hidden
in
their
forests
and
did
not
venture
near
the
great
cities
the
hans
had
built
little
attention
was
paid
to
them
then
began
the
building
of
the
new
american
civilization
families
and
individuals
gathered
together
in
clans
or
gangs
for
mutual
protection
for
nearly
a
century
they
lived
a
nomadic
and
primitive
life
moving
from
place
to
place
in
desperate
fear
of
the
casual
and
occasional
han
air
raids
and
the
terrible
disintegrator
ray
as
the
frequency
of
these
raids
decreased
they
began
to
stay
permanently
in
given
localities
organizing
upon
lines
which
in
many
respects
were
similar
to
those
of
the
military
households
of
the
norman
feudal
barons
except
that
instead
of
gathering
together
in
castles
their
defense
tactics
necessitated
a
certain
scattering
of
living
quarters
for
families
and
individuals
they
lived
virtually
in
the
open
air
in
the
forests
in
green
tents
resorting
to
camouflage
tactics
that
would
conceal
their
presence
from
air
observers
they
dug
underground
factories
and
laboratories
that
they
might
better
be
shielded
from
the
electrical
detectors
of
the
hans
they
tapped
the
radio
communication
lines
of
the
hans
with
crude
instruments
at
first
better
ones
later
on
they
bent
every
effort
toward
the
redevelopment
of
science
for
many
generations
they
labored
as
unseen
unknown
scholars
of
the
hans
picking
up
their
knowledge
piecemeal
as
fast
as
they
were
able
to
during
the
earlier
part
of
this
period
there
were
many
deadly
wars
fought
between
the
various
gangs
and
occasional
courageous
but
childishly
futile
attacks
upon
the
hans
followed
by
terribly
punitive
raids
but
as
knowledge
progressed
the
sense
of
american
brotherhood
redeveloped
reciprocal
arrangements
were
made
among
the
gangs
over
constantly
increasing
areas
trade
developed
to
a
certain
extent
as
between
one
gang
and
another
but
the
interchange
of
knowledge
became
more
important
than
that
of
goods
as
skill
in
the
handling
of
synthetic
processes
developed
within
the
gang
an
economy
was
developed
that
was
a
compromise
between
individual
liberty
and
a
military
socialism
the
right
of
private
property
was
limited
practically
to
personal
possessions
but
private
privileges
were
many
and
sacredly
regarded
stimulation
to
achievement
lay
chiefly
in
the
winning
of
various
kinds
of
leadership
and
prerogatives
and
only
in
a
very
limited
degree
in
the
hope
of
owning
anything
that
might
be
classified
as
wealth
and
nothing
that
might
be
classified
as
resources
resources
of
every
description
for
military
safety
and
efficiency
belonged
as
a
matter
of
public
interest
to
the
community
as
a
whole
in
the
meantime
through
these
many
generations
the
hans
had
developed
a
luxury
economy
and
with
it
the
perfection
of
gilded
vice
and
degradation
the
americans
were
regarded
as
wild
men
of
the
woods
and
since
they
neither
needed
nor
wanted
the
woods
or
the
wild
men
they
treated
them
as
beasts
and
were
conscious
of
no
human
brotherhood
with
them
as
time
went
on
and
synthetic
processes
of
producing
foods
and
materials
were
further
developed
less
and
less
ground
was
needed
by
the
hans
for
the
purposes
of
agriculture
and
finally
even
the
working
of
mines
was
abandoned
when
it
became
cheaper
to
build
up
metal
from
electronic
vibrations
than
to
dig
them
out
of
the
ground
the
han
race
devitalized
by
its
vices
and
luxuries
with
machinery
and
scientific
processes
to
satisfy
its
every
want
with
virtually
no
necessity
of
labor
began
to
assume
a
defensive
attitude
toward
the
americans
and
quite
naturally
the
americans
regarded
the
hans
with
a
deep
grim
hatred
conscious
of
individual
superiority
as
men
knowing
that
latterly
they
were
outstripping
the
hans
in
science
and
civilization
they
longed
desperately
for
the
day
when
they
should
be
powerful
enough
to
rise
and
annihilate
the
yellow
blight
that
lay
over
the
continent
at
the
time
of
my
awakening
the
gangs
were
rather
loosely
organized
but
were
considering
the
establishment
of
a
special
military
force
whose
special
business
it
would
be
to
harry
the
hans
and
bring
down
their
air
ships
whenever
possible
without
causing
general
alarm
among
the
mongolians
this
force
was
destined
to
become
the
nucleus
of
the
national
force
when
the
day
of
retribution
arrived
but
that
however
did
not
happen
for
ten
years
and
is
another
story
illustration
on
the
left
of
the
illustration
is
a
han
girl
and
on
the
right
is
an
american
girl
who
like
all
of
her
race
is
equipped
with
an
inertron
belt
and
a
rocket
gun
wilma
told
me
she
was
a
member
of
the
wyoming
gang
which
claimed
the
entire
wyoming
valley
as
its
territory
under
the
leadership
of
boss
hart
her
mother
and
father
were
dead
and
she
was
unmarried
so
she
was
not
a
family
member
she
lived
in
a
little
group
of
tents
known
as
camp
under
a
woman
camp
boss
with
seven
other
girls
her
duties
alternated
between
military
or
police
scouting
and
factory
work
for
the
period
which
would
end
the
next
day
she
had
been
on
air
patrol
this
did
not
mean
as
i
first
imagined
that
she
was
flying
but
rather
that
she
was
on
the
lookout
for
han
ships
over
this
outlying
section
of
the
wyoming
territory
and
had
spent
most
of
her
time
perched
in
the
tree
tops
scanning
the
skies
had
she
seen
one
she
would
have
fired
a
drop
flare
several
miles
off
to
one
side
which
would
ignite
when
it
was
floating
vertically
toward
the
earth
so
that
the
direction
or
point
from
which
if
had
been
fired
might
not
be
guessed
by
the
airship
and
bring
a
blasting
play
of
the
disintegrator
ray
in
her
vicinity
other
members
of
the
air
patrol
would
send
up
rockets
on
seeing
hers
until
finally
a
scout
equipped
with
an
ultrophone
which
unlike
the
ancient
radio
operated
on
the
ultronic
ethereal
vibrations
would
pass
the
warning
simultaneously
to
the
headquarters
of
the
wyoming
gang
and
other
communities
within
a
radius
of
several
hundred
miles
not
to
mention
the
few
american
rocket
ships
that
might
be
in
the
air
and
which
instantly
would
duck
to
cover
either
through
forest
clearings
or
by
flattening
down
to
earth
in
green
fields
where
their
coloring
would
probably
protect
them
from
observation
the
favorite
american
method
of
propulsion
was
known
as
the
is
what
i
would
describe
from
my
century
comprehension
of
the
matter
as
an
extremely
powerful
gas
blast
atomically
produced
through
the
stimulation
of
chemical
action
scientists
of
today
regard
it
as
a
childishly
simple
reaction
but
by
that
very
virtue
most
economical
and
efficient
but
tomorrow
she
explained
she
would
go
back
to
work
in
the
cloth
plant
where
she
would
take
charge
of
one
of
the
synthetic
processes
by
which
those
wonderful
substitutes
for
woven
fabrics
of
wool
cotton
and
silk
are
produced
at
the
end
of
another
two
weeks
she
would
be
back
on
military
duty
again
perhaps
at
the
same
work
or
maybe
as
a
contact
guard
on
duty
where
the
territory
of
the
wyomings
merged
with
that
of
the
delawares
or
the
susquannas
susquehannas
or
one
of
the
half
dozen
other
gangs
in
that
section
of
the
country
which
i
knew
as
pennsylvania
and
new
york
states
wilma
cleared
up
for
me
the
mystery
of
those
flying
leaps
which
she
and
her
assailants
had
made
and
explained
in
the
following
manner
how
the
inertron
belt
balances
weight
were
in
common
use
at
the
time
i
awoke
though
they
were
costly
for
at
that
time
had
not
been
produced
in
very
great
quantity
they
were
very
useful
in
the
forest
they
were
belts
strapped
high
under
the
arms
containing
an
amount
of
inertron
adjusted
to
the
wearer
weight
and
purposes
in
effect
they
made
a
man
weigh
as
little
as
he
desired
two
pounds
if
he
liked
are
a
later
development
of
rocket
motors
encased
in
blocks
and
strapped
to
the
back
in
such
a
way
that
the
wearer
floats
when
drifting
facing
slightly
downward
with
his
motor
in
operation
he
moves
like
a
diver
headforemost
controlling
his
direction
by
twisting
his
body
and
by
movements
of
his
outstretched
arms
and
hands
ballast
weights
locked
in
the
front
of
the
belt
adjust
weight
and
lift
some
men
prefer
a
few
ounces
of
weight
in
floating
using
a
slight
motor
thrust
to
overcome
this
others
prefer
a
buoyance
balance
of
a
few
ounces
the
inadvertent
dropping
of
weight
is
not
a
serious
matter
the
motor
thrust
always
can
be
used
to
descend
but
as
an
extra
precaution
in
case
the
motor
should
fail
for
any
reason
there
are
built
into
every
belt
a
number
of
detachable
sections
one
or
more
of
which
can
be
discarded
to
balance
off
any
loss
in
weight
but
who
were
your
assailants
i
asked
and
why
were
you
attacked
her
assailants
she
told
me
were
members
of
an
outlaw
gang
referred
to
as
bad
bloods
a
group
which
for
several
generations
had
been
under
the
domination
of
conscienceless
leaders
who
tried
to
advance
the
interests
of
their
clan
by
tactics
which
their
neighbors
had
come
to
regard
as
unfair
and
who
in
consequence
had
been
virtually
boycotted
their
purpose
had
been
to
slay
her
near
the
delaware
frontier
making
it
appear
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
by
delaware
scouts
and
thus
embroil
the
delawares
and
wyomings
in
acts
of
reprisal
against
each
other
or
at
least
cause
suspicions
fortunately
they
had
not
succeeded
in
surprising
her
and
she
had
been
successful
in
dodging
them
for
some
two
hours
before
the
shooting
began
at
the
moment
when
i
arrived
on
the
scene
but
we
must
not
stay
here
talking
wilma
concluded
i
have
to
take
you
in
and
besides
i
must
report
this
attack
right
away
i
think
we
had
better
slip
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
whoever
is
on
that
post
will
have
a
phone
and
i
can
make
a
direct
report
but
you
have
to
have
a
belt
mine
alone
wo
help
much
against
our
combined
weights
and
there
little
to
be
gained
by
jumping
heavy
it
almost
as
bad
as
walking
after
a
little
search
we
found
one
of
the
men
i
had
killed
who
had
floated
down
among
the
trees
some
distance
away
and
whose
belt
was
not
badly
damaged
in
detaching
it
from
his
body
it
nearly
got
away
from
me
and
shot
up
in
the
air
wilma
caught
it
however
and
though
it
reinforced
the
lift
of
her
own
belt
so
that
she
had
to
hook
her
knee
around
a
branch
to
hold
herself
down
she
saved
it
i
climbed
the
tree
and
with
my
weight
added
to
hers
we
floated
down
easily
chapter
iii
life
in
the
century
we
were
delayed
in
starting
for
quite
a
while
since
i
had
to
acquire
a
few
crude
ideas
about
the
technique
of
using
these
belts
i
had
been
sitting
down
for
instance
with
the
belt
strapped
about
me
enjoying
an
ease
similar
to
that
of
a
comfortable
armchair
when
i
stood
up
with
a
natural
exertion
of
muscular
effort
i
shot
ten
feet
into
the
air
with
a
wild
instinctive
thrashing
of
arms
and
legs
that
amused
wilma
greatly
but
after
some
practice
i
began
to
get
the
trick
of
gauging
muscular
effort
to
a
minimum
of
vertical
and
a
maximum
of
horizontal
the
correct
form
i
found
was
in
a
measure
comparable
to
that
of
skating
i
found
also
that
in
forest
work
particularly
the
arms
and
hands
could
be
used
to
great
advantage
in
swinging
along
from
branch
to
branch
so
prolonging
leaps
almost
indefinitely
at
times
in
going
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
i
found
that
my
century
muscles
did
have
an
advantage
in
spite
of
lack
of
skill
with
the
belt
and
since
the
slopes
were
very
sharp
and
most
of
our
leaps
were
upward
i
could
have
distanced
wilma
easily
but
when
we
crossed
the
ridge
and
descended
she
outstripped
me
with
her
superior
technique
choosing
the
steepest
slopes
she
would
crouch
in
the
top
of
a
tree
and
propel
herself
outward
literally
diving
until
with
the
loss
of
horizontal
momentum
she
would
assume
a
more
upright
position
and
float
downward
in
this
manner
she
would
sometimes
cover
as
much
as
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
a
single
leap
while
i
leaped
and
scrambled
clumsily
behind
thoroughly
enjoying
the
novel
sensation
half
way
down
the
mountain
we
saw
another
figure
leap
out
above
the
tree
tops
toward
us
the
three
of
us
perched
on
an
outcropping
of
rock
from
which
a
view
for
many
miles
around
could
be
had
while
wilma
hastily
explained
her
adventure
and
my
presence
to
her
fellow
guard
whose
name
was
alan
i
learned
later
that
this
was
the
modern
form
of
helen
you
want
to
report
by
phone
then
do
you
alan
took
a
compact
packet
about
six
inches
square
from
a
holster
attached
to
her
belt
and
handed
it
to
wilma
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
had
no
special
receiver
for
the
ear
wilma
merely
threw
back
a
lid
as
though
she
were
opening
a
book
and
began
to
talk
the
voice
that
came
back
from
the
machine
was
as
audible
as
her
own
she
was
queried
closely
as
to
the
attack
upon
her
and
at
considerable
length
as
to
myself
and
i
could
tell
from
the
tone
of
that
voice
that
its
owner
was
not
prepared
to
take
me
at
my
face
value
as
readily
as
wilma
had
for
that
matter
neither
was
the
other
girl
i
could
realize
it
from
the
suspicious
glances
she
threw
my
way
when
she
thought
my
attention
was
elsewhere
and
the
manner
in
which
her
hand
hovered
constantly
near
her
gun
holster
wilma
was
ordered
to
bring
me
in
at
once
and
informed
that
another
scout
would
take
her
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
so
she
closed
down
the
lid
of
the
phone
and
handed
it
back
to
alan
who
seemed
relieved
to
see
us
departing
over
the
tree
tops
in
the
direction
of
the
camps
we
had
covered
perhaps
ten
miles
in
what
still
seemed
to
me
a
surprisingly
easy
fashion
when
wilma
explained
that
from
here
on
we
would
have
to
keep
to
the
ground
we
were
nearing
the
camps
she
said
and
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
some
small
han
scoutship
invisible
high
in
the
sky
might
catch
sight
of
us
through
a
projectoscope
and
thus
find
the
general
location
of
the
camps
wilma
took
me
to
the
scout
office
which
proved
to
be
a
small
building
of
irregular
shape
conforming
to
the
trees
around
it
and
substantially
constructed
of
green
material
i
was
received
by
the
assistant
scout
boss
who
reported
my
arrival
at
once
to
the
historical
office
and
to
officials
he
called
the
psycho
boss
and
the
history
boss
who
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
the
attitude
of
all
three
men
was
at
first
polite
but
skeptical
and
wilma
ardent
advocacy
seemed
to
amuse
them
secretly
for
the
next
two
hours
i
talked
explained
and
answered
questions
i
had
to
explain
in
detail
the
manner
of
my
life
in
the
century
and
my
understanding
of
customs
habits
business
science
and
the
history
of
that
period
and
about
developments
in
the
centuries
that
had
elapsed
had
i
been
in
a
classroom
i
would
have
come
through
the
examination
with
a
very
poor
mark
for
i
was
unable
to
give
any
answer
to
fully
half
of
their
questions
but
before
long
i
realized
that
the
majority
of
these
questions
were
designed
as
traps
objects
of
whose
purpose
i
knew
nothing
were
casually
handed
to
me
and
i
was
watched
keenly
as
i
handled
them
in
the
end
i
could
see
both
amazement
and
belief
begin
to
show
in
the
faces
of
my
inquisitors
and
at
last
the
historical
and
psycho
bosses
agreed
openly
that
they
could
find
no
flaw
in
my
story
or
reactions
and
that
unbelievable
as
it
seemed
my
story
must
be
accepted
as
genuine
they
took
me
at
once
to
big
boss
hart
he
was
a
portly
man
with
a
poker
face
he
would
probably
have
been
the
successful
politician
even
in
the
century
they
gave
him
a
brief
outline
of
my
story
and
a
report
of
their
examination
of
me
he
made
no
comment
other
than
to
nod
his
acceptance
of
it
then
he
turned
to
me
how
does
it
feel
he
asked
do
we
look
funny
to
you
a
bit
strange
i
admitted
but
i
beginning
to
lose
that
dazed
feeling
though
i
can
see
i
have
an
awful
lot
to
learn
maybe
we
can
learn
some
things
from
you
too
he
said
so
you
fought
in
the
first
world
war
do
you
know
we
have
very
little
left
in
the
way
of
records
of
the
details
of
that
war
that
is
the
precise
conditions
under
which
it
was
fought
and
the
tactics
employed
we
forgot
many
things
during
the
han
terror
and
well
i
think
you
might
have
a
lot
of
ideas
worth
thinking
over
for
our
raid
masters
by
the
way
now
that
you
here
and
ca
go
back
to
your
own
century
so
to
speak
what
do
you
want
to
do
you
welcome
to
become
one
of
us
or
perhaps
just
like
to
visit
with
us
for
a
while
and
then
look
around
among
the
other
gangs
maybe
you
like
some
of
the
others
better
do
make
up
your
mind
now
we
put
you
down
as
an
exchange
for
a
while
let
see
you
and
bill
hearn
ought
to
get
along
well
together
he
camp
boss
of
number
when
he
is
acting
as
raid
boss
or
scout
boss
there
a
vacancy
in
his
camp
stay
with
him
and
think
things
over
as
long
as
you
want
to
as
soon
as
you
make
up
your
mind
to
anything
let
me
know
we
all
shook
hands
for
that
was
one
custom
that
had
not
died
out
in
five
hundred
years
and
i
set
out
with
bill
hearn
bill
like
all
the
others
was
clad
in
green
he
was
a
big
man
that
is
he
was
about
my
own
height
five
feet
eleven
this
was
considerably
above
the
average
now
for
the
race
had
lost
something
in
stature
it
seemed
through
the
vicissitudes
of
five
centuries
most
of
the
women
were
a
bit
below
five
feet
and
the
men
only
a
trifle
above
this
height
for
a
period
of
two
weeks
bill
was
to
confine
himself
to
camp
duties
so
i
had
a
good
chance
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
community
life
it
was
not
easy
there
were
so
many
marvels
to
absorb
i
never
ceased
to
wonder
at
the
strange
combination
of
rustic
social
life
and
feverish
industrial
activity
at
least
it
was
strange
to
me
for
in
my
experience
industrial
development
meant
crowded
cities
tenements
paved
streets
profusion
of
vehicles
noise
hurrying
men
and
women
with
strained
or
dull
faces
vast
structures
and
ornate
public
works
here
however
was
rustic
simplicity
apparently
isolated
families
and
groups
living
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
with
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
between
households
a
total
absence
of
crowds
no
means
of
conveyance
other
than
the
belts
called
jumpers
almost
constantly
worn
by
everybody
and
an
occasional
rocket
ship
used
only
for
longer
journeys
and
underground
plants
or
factories
that
were
to
my
mind
more
like
laboratories
and
engine
rooms
many
of
them
were
excavations
as
deep
as
mines
with
well
finished
lighted
and
comfortable
interiors
these
people
were
adepts
at
camouflage
against
air
observation
not
only
would
their
activity
have
been
unsuspected
by
an
airship
passing
over
the
center
of
the
community
but
even
by
an
enemy
who
might
happen
to
drop
through
the
screen
of
the
upper
branches
to
the
floor
of
the
forest
the
camps
or
household
structures
were
all
irregular
in
shape
and
of
colors
that
blended
with
the
great
trees
among
which
they
were
hidden
there
were
dwellings
or
camps
among
the
wyomings
located
within
an
area
of
about
fifteen
square
miles
the
total
population
was
every
man
woman
and
child
whether
member
or
exchange
being
listed
the
plants
were
widely
scattered
through
the
territory
also
nowhere
was
anything
like
congestion
permitted
so
far
as
possible
families
and
individuals
were
assigned
to
living
quarters
not
too
far
from
the
plants
or
offices
in
which
their
work
lay
all
men
and
women
alternated
in
periods
between
military
and
industrial
service
except
those
who
were
needed
for
household
work
since
working
conditions
in
the
plants
and
offices
were
ideal
and
everybody
thus
had
plenty
of
healthy
outdoor
activity
in
addition
the
population
was
sturdy
and
active
laziness
was
regarded
as
nearly
the
greatest
of
social
offenses
hard
work
and
general
merit
were
variously
rewarded
with
extra
privileges
advancement
to
positions
of
authority
and
with
various
items
of
personal
equipment
for
convenience
and
luxury
in
leisure
moments
i
got
great
enjoyment
from
sitting
outside
the
dwelling
in
which
i
was
quartered
with
bill
hearn
and
ten
other
men
watching
the
occasional
as
with
leisurely
but
swift
movements
they
swung
up
and
down
the
forest
trail
rising
from
the
ground
in
long
leaps
occasionally
swinging
from
one
convenient
branch
overhead
to
another
before
sliding
back
to
the
ground
farther
on
normal
traveling
pace
where
these
trails
were
straight
enough
was
about
twenty
miles
an
hour
such
things
as
automobiles
and
railroad
trains
the
memory
of
them
not
more
than
a
month
old
in
my
mind
seemed
inexpressibly
silly
and
futile
compared
with
such
convenience
as
these
belts
or
jumpers
offered
bill
suggested
that
i
wander
around
for
several
days
from
plant
to
plant
to
observe
and
study
what
i
could
the
entire
community
had
been
apprised
of
my
coming
my
rating
as
an
exchange
reaching
every
building
and
post
in
the
community
by
means
of
ultronic
broadcast
everywhere
i
was
welcomed
in
an
interested
and
helpful
spirit
i
visited
the
plants
where
ultronic
vibrations
were
isolated
from
the
ether
and
through
slow
processes
built
up
into
electronic
and
atomic
forms
into
the
two
great
synthetic
elements
ultron
and
inertron
i
learned
something
superficially
at
least
of
the
processes
of
combined
chemical
and
mechanical
action
through
which
were
produced
the
various
forms
of
synthetic
cloth
i
watched
the
manufacture
of
the
machines
which
were
used
at
locations
of
construction
to
produce
the
various
forms
of
building
materials
but
i
was
particularly
interested
in
the
munitions
plants
and
the
shops
ultron
is
a
solid
of
great
molecular
density
and
moderate
elasticity
which
has
the
property
of
being
percent
conductive
to
those
pulsations
known
as
light
electricity
and
heat
since
it
is
completely
permeable
to
light
vibrations
it
is
therefore
invisible
and
its
magnetic
response
is
almost
but
not
quite
percent
also
it
is
therefore
very
heavy
under
normal
conditions
but
extremely
responsive
to
the
or
rays
such
as
the
hans
use
as
for
their
airships
inertron
is
the
second
great
triumph
of
american
research
and
experimentation
with
ultronic
forces
it
was
developed
just
a
few
years
before
my
awakening
in
the
abandoned
mine
it
is
a
synthetic
element
built
up
through
a
complicated
heterodyning
of
ultronic
pulsations
from
forms
it
is
completely
inert
to
both
electric
and
magnetic
forces
in
all
the
orders
above
the
that
is
to
say
the
the
the
and
the
in
consequence
it
has
a
number
of
amazing
and
valuable
properties
one
of
these
is
total
lack
of
another
is
a
total
lack
of
heat
it
has
no
molecular
vibration
whatever
it
reflects
percent
of
the
heat
and
light
impinging
upon
it
it
does
not
feel
cold
to
the
touch
of
course
since
it
will
not
absorb
the
heat
of
the
hand
it
is
a
solid
very
dense
in
molecular
structure
despite
its
lack
of
weight
of
great
strength
and
considerable
elasticity
it
is
a
perfect
shield
against
the
disintegrator
rays
illustration
setting
his
rocket
gun
for
a
shot
rocket
guns
are
very
simple
contrivances
so
far
as
the
mechanism
of
launching
the
bullet
is
concerned
they
are
simple
light
tubes
closed
at
the
rear
end
with
a
pin
for
piercing
the
thin
skin
at
the
base
of
the
cartridge
this
piercing
of
the
skin
starts
the
chemical
and
atomic
reaction
the
entire
cartridge
leaves
the
tube
under
its
own
power
at
a
very
easy
initial
velocity
just
enough
to
insure
accuracy
of
aim
so
the
tube
does
not
have
to
be
of
heavy
construction
the
bullet
increases
in
velocity
as
it
goes
it
may
be
solid
or
explosive
it
may
explode
on
contact
or
on
time
or
a
combination
of
these
two
bill
and
i
talked
mostly
of
weapons
military
tactics
and
strategy
strangely
enough
he
had
no
idea
whatever
of
the
possibilities
of
the
barrage
though
the
tremendous
effect
of
a
curtain
of
fire
with
such
projectiles
as
these
modern
rocket
guns
used
was
obvious
to
me
but
the
barrage
idea
it
seemed
has
been
lost
track
of
completely
in
the
air
wars
that
followed
the
first
world
war
and
in
the
peculiar
guerilla
tactics
developed
by
americans
in
the
later
period
of
operations
from
the
ground
against
han
airships
and
in
the
gang
wars
which
until
a
few
generations
ago
i
learned
had
been
almost
continuous
i
wonder
said
bill
one
day
if
we
could
work
up
some
form
of
barrage
to
spring
on
the
bad
bloods
the
big
boss
told
me
today
that
he
been
in
communication
with
the
other
gangs
and
all
are
agreed
that
the
bad
bloods
might
as
well
be
wiped
out
for
good
that
attempt
on
wilma
deering
life
and
their
evident
desire
to
make
trouble
among
the
gangs
has
stirred
up
every
community
east
of
the
alleghenies
the
boss
says
that
none
of
the
others
will
object
if
we
go
after
them
so
i
imagine
that
before
long
we
will
now
show
me
again
how
you
worked
that
business
in
the
argonne
forest
the
conditions
ought
to
be
pretty
much
the
same
i
went
over
it
with
him
in
detail
and
gradually
we
worked
out
a
modified
plan
that
would
be
better
adapted
to
our
more
powerful
weapons
and
the
use
of
jumpers
it
will
be
easy
bill
exulted
i
slide
down
and
talk
it
over
with
the
boss
tomorrow
during
the
first
two
weeks
of
my
stay
with
the
wyomings
wilma
deering
and
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
i
naturally
felt
a
little
closer
friendship
for
her
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
the
first
human
being
i
saw
after
waking
from
my
long
sleep
her
appreciation
of
my
saving
her
life
though
i
could
not
have
done
otherwise
than
i
did
in
that
matter
and
most
of
all
my
own
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
she
had
not
found
it
as
difficult
as
the
others
to
believe
my
story
operated
in
the
same
direction
i
could
easily
imagine
my
story
must
have
sounded
incredible
it
was
natural
enough
too
that
she
should
feel
an
unusual
interest
in
me
in
the
first
place
i
was
her
personal
discovery
in
the
second
she
was
a
girl
of
studious
and
reflective
turn
of
mind
she
never
got
tired
of
my
stories
and
descriptions
of
the
century
the
others
of
the
community
however
seemed
to
find
our
friendship
a
bit
amusing
it
seemed
that
wilma
had
a
reputation
for
being
cold
toward
the
opposite
sex
and
so
others
not
being
able
to
appreciate
some
of
her
fine
qualities
as
i
did
misinterpreted
her
attitude
much
to
their
own
delight
wilma
and
i
however
ignored
this
as
much
as
we
could
chapter
iv
a
han
air
raid
there
was
a
girl
in
wilma
camp
named
gerdi
mann
with
whom
bill
hearn
was
desperately
in
love
and
the
four
of
us
used
to
go
around
a
lot
together
gerdi
was
a
distinct
type
whereas
wilma
had
the
usual
dark
brown
hair
and
hazel
eyes
that
marked
nearly
every
member
of
the
community
gerdi
had
red
hair
blue
eyes
and
very
fair
skin
she
has
been
dead
many
years
now
but
i
remember
her
vividly
because
she
was
a
throwback
in
physical
appearance
to
a
certain
century
type
which
i
have
found
very
rare
among
modern
americans
also
because
the
four
of
us
were
engaged
one
day
in
a
discussion
of
this
very
point
when
i
obtained
my
first
experience
of
a
han
air
raid
we
were
sitting
high
on
the
side
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
valley
that
teemed
with
human
activity
invisible
beneath
its
blanket
of
foliage
the
other
three
who
knew
of
the
irish
but
vaguely
and
indefinitely
as
a
race
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
which
like
ourselves
had
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
precarious
and
fugitive
existence
in
rebellion
against
the
mongolian
domination
of
the
earth
were
listening
with
interest
to
my
theory
that
gerdi
ancestors
of
several
hundred
years
ago
must
have
been
irish
i
explained
that
gerdi
was
an
irish
type
evidently
a
throwback
and
that
her
surname
might
well
have
been
mcmann
or
mcmahan
and
still
more
anciently
mac
mathghamhain
they
were
interested
too
in
my
surmise
that
gerdi
was
the
same
name
as
that
which
had
been
gerty
or
gertrude
in
the
century
in
the
middle
of
our
discussion
we
were
startled
by
an
alarm
rocket
that
burst
high
in
the
air
far
to
the
north
spreading
a
pall
of
red
smoke
that
drifted
like
a
cloud
it
was
followed
by
others
at
scattered
points
in
the
northern
sky
a
han
raid
bill
exclaimed
in
amazement
the
first
in
seven
years
maybe
it
just
one
of
their
ships
off
its
course
i
ventured
no
said
wilma
in
some
agitation
that
would
be
green
rockets
red
means
only
one
thing
tony
they
sweeping
the
countryside
with
their
dis
beams
can
you
see
anything
bill
we
had
better
get
under
cover
gerdi
said
nervously
the
four
of
us
are
bunched
here
in
the
open
for
all
we
know
they
may
be
twelve
miles
up
out
of
sight
yet
looking
at
us
with
a
projecto
bill
had
been
sweeping
the
horizon
hastily
with
his
glass
but
apparently
saw
nothing
we
had
better
scatter
at
that
he
said
finally
it
orders
you
know
see
he
pointed
to
the
valley
here
and
there
a
tiny
human
figure
shot
for
a
moment
above
the
foliage
of
the
treetops
that
bad
wilma
commented
as
she
counted
the
jumpers
no
less
than
fifteen
people
visible
and
all
clearly
radiating
from
a
central
point
do
they
want
to
give
away
our
location
the
standard
orders
covering
air
raids
were
that
the
population
was
to
scatter
individually
there
should
be
no
grouping
or
even
pairing
in
view
of
the
destructiveness
of
the
disintegrator
rays
experience
of
generations
had
proved
that
if
this
were
done
and
everybody
remained
hidden
beneath
the
tree
screens
the
hans
would
have
to
sweep
mile
after
mile
of
territory
foot
by
foot
to
catch
more
than
a
small
percentage
of
the
community
gerdi
however
refused
to
leave
bill
and
wilma
developed
an
equal
obstinacy
against
quitting
my
side
i
was
inexperienced
at
this
sort
of
thing
she
explained
quite
ignoring
the
fact
that
she
was
too
she
was
only
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
last
air
raid
however
since
i
could
not
argue
her
out
of
it
we
leaped
together
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
right
while
bill
and
gerdi
disappeared
down
the
hillside
among
the
trees
wilma
and
i
both
wanted
a
point
of
vantage
from
which
we
might
overlook
the
valley
and
the
sky
to
the
north
and
we
found
it
near
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
protected
from
visibility
by
thick
branches
we
could
look
out
between
the
tree
trunks
and
get
a
good
view
of
the
valley
no
more
rockets
went
up
except
for
a
few
of
those
warning
red
clouds
drifting
lazily
in
a
blue
sky
there
was
no
visible
indication
of
past
or
present
existence
anywhere
in
the
sky
or
on
the
ground
then
wilma
gripped
my
arm
and
pointed
i
saw
it
away
off
in
the
distance
looking
like
a
phantom
dirigible
airship
in
its
coat
of
paint
a
bare
spectre
seven
thousand
feet
up
wilma
whispered
crouching
close
to
me
watch
the
ship
was
about
the
same
shape
as
the
great
dirigibles
of
the
century
that
i
had
seen
but
without
the
suspended
control
car
engines
propellors
rudders
or
elevating
planes
as
it
loomed
rapidly
nearer
i
saw
that
it
was
wider
and
somewhat
flatter
than
i
had
supposed
now
i
could
see
the
repellor
rays
that
held
the
ship
aloft
like
searchlight
beams
faintly
visible
in
the
bright
daylight
and
still
faintly
visible
to
the
human
eye
at
night
actually
i
had
been
informed
by
my
instructors
there
were
two
rays
the
visible
one
generated
by
the
ship
apparatus
and
directed
toward
the
ground
as
a
beam
of
carrier
impulses
and
the
true
repellor
ray
the
complement
of
the
other
in
one
sense
induced
by
the
action
of
the
carrier
and
reacting
in
a
concentrating
upward
direction
from
the
mass
of
the
earth
becoming
successively
electronic
atomic
and
finally
molecular
in
its
nature
according
to
various
ratios
of
distance
between
earth
mass
and
carrier
source
until
in
the
last
analysis
the
ship
itself
actually
is
supported
on
an
upward
rushing
column
of
air
much
like
a
ball
continuously
supported
on
a
fountain
jet
the
raider
neared
with
incredible
speed
its
rays
were
both
slanted
astern
at
a
sharp
angle
so
that
it
slid
forward
with
tremendous
momentum
the
ship
was
operating
two
disintegrator
rays
though
only
in
a
casual
intermittent
fashion
but
whenever
they
flashed
downward
with
blinding
brilliancy
forest
rocks
and
ground
melted
instantaneously
into
nothing
where
they
played
upon
them
when
later
i
inspected
the
scars
left
by
these
rays
i
found
them
some
five
feet
deep
and
thirty
feet
wide
the
exposed
surfaces
being
in
texture
but
of
a
pale
iridescent
greenish
hue
no
systematic
use
of
the
rays
was
made
by
the
ship
however
until
it
reached
a
point
over
the
center
of
the
valley
the
center
of
the
community
activities
there
it
came
to
a
sudden
stop
by
shooting
its
repellor
beams
sharply
forward
and
easing
them
back
gradually
to
the
vertical
holding
the
ship
floating
and
motionless
then
the
work
of
destruction
began
systematically
back
and
forth
traveled
the
destroying
rays
ploughing
parallel
furrows
from
hillside
to
hillside
we
gasped
in
dismay
wilma
and
i
as
time
after
time
we
saw
it
plough
through
sections
where
we
knew
camps
or
plants
were
located
this
is
awful
she
moaned
a
terrified
question
in
her
eyes
how
could
they
know
the
location
so
exactly
tony
did
you
see
they
were
never
in
doubt
they
stalled
at
a
predetermined
spot
and
and
it
was
exactly
the
right
spot
we
did
not
talk
of
what
might
happen
if
the
rays
were
turned
in
our
direction
we
both
knew
we
would
simply
disintegrate
in
a
split
second
into
mere
scattered
electronic
vibrations
strangely
enough
it
was
this
girl
of
the
century
who
clung
to
me
a
relatively
primitive
man
of
the
less
familiar
than
she
with
the
thought
of
this
terrifying
possibility
for
moral
support
we
knew
that
many
of
our
companions
must
have
been
whisked
into
absolute
before
our
eyes
in
these
few
moments
the
whole
thing
paralyzed
us
into
mental
and
physical
immobility
for
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
could
have
been
long
however
for
the
rays
had
not
ploughed
more
than
thirty
of
their
furrows
or
so
across
the
valley
when
i
regained
control
of
myself
and
brought
wilma
to
herself
by
shaking
her
roughly
how
far
will
this
rocket
gun
shoot
wilma
i
demanded
drawing
my
pistol
it
depends
on
your
rocket
tony
it
will
take
even
the
longest
range
rocket
but
you
could
shoot
more
accurately
from
a
longer
tube
but
why
you
could
penetrate
the
shell
of
that
ship
with
rocket
force
even
if
you
could
reach
it
i
fumbled
clumsily
with
my
rocket
pouch
for
i
was
excited
i
had
an
idea
i
wanted
to
try
a
hunch
i
called
it
forgetting
that
wilma
could
not
understand
my
ancient
slang
but
finally
with
her
help
i
selected
the
longest
range
explosive
rocket
in
my
pouch
and
fitted
it
to
my
pistol
it
wo
carry
seven
thousand
feet
tony
wilma
objected
but
i
took
aim
carefully
it
was
another
thought
that
i
had
in
my
mind
the
supporting
repellor
ray
i
had
been
told
became
molecular
in
character
at
what
was
called
a
logarithmic
level
of
five
below
that
it
was
a
purely
electronic
flow
or
pulsation
between
the
source
of
the
carrier
and
the
average
mass
of
the
earth
below
that
level
if
i
could
project
my
explosive
bullet
into
this
stream
where
it
began
to
carry
material
substance
upward
might
it
not
rise
with
the
air
column
gathering
speed
and
hitting
the
ship
with
enough
impact
to
carry
it
through
the
shell
it
was
worth
trying
anyhow
wilma
became
greatly
excited
too
when
she
grasped
the
nature
of
my
inspiration
feverishly
i
looked
around
for
some
formation
of
branches
against
which
i
could
rest
the
pistol
for
i
had
to
aim
most
carefully
at
last
i
found
one
patiently
i
sighted
on
the
hulk
of
the
ship
far
above
us
aiming
at
the
far
side
of
it
at
such
an
angle
as
would
so
far
as
i
could
estimate
bring
my
bullet
path
through
the
forward
repellor
beam
at
last
the
sights
wavered
across
the
point
i
sought
and
i
pressed
the
button
gently
for
a
moment
we
gazed
breathlessly
suddenly
the
ship
swung
bow
down
as
on
a
pivot
and
swayed
like
a
pendulum
wilma
screamed
in
her
excitement
oh
tony
you
hit
it
you
hit
it
do
it
again
bring
it
down
we
had
only
one
more
rocket
of
extreme
range
between
us
and
we
dropped
it
three
times
in
our
excitement
in
inserting
it
in
my
gun
then
forcing
myself
to
be
calm
by
sheer
will
power
while
wilma
stuffed
her
little
fist
into
her
mouth
to
keep
from
shrieking
i
sighted
carefully
again
and
fired
in
a
flash
wilma
had
grasped
the
hope
that
this
discovery
of
mine
might
lead
to
the
end
of
the
han
domination
the
elapsed
time
of
the
rocket
invisible
flight
seemed
an
age
then
we
saw
the
ship
falling
it
seemed
to
plunge
lazily
but
actually
it
fell
with
terrific
acceleration
turning
end
over
end
its
disintegrator
rays
out
of
control
describing
vast
wild
arcs
and
once
cutting
a
gash
through
the
forest
less
than
two
hundred
feet
from
where
we
stood
the
crash
with
which
the
heavy
craft
hit
the
ground
reverberated
from
the
hills
the
momentum
of
eighteen
or
twenty
thousand
tons
in
a
sheer
drop
of
seven
thousand
feet
a
mangled
mass
of
metal
it
buried
itself
in
the
ground
with
poetic
justice
in
the
middle
of
the
smoking
field
of
destruction
it
had
been
so
deliberately
ploughing
the
silence
the
vacuity
of
the
landscape
was
oppressive
as
the
last
echoes
died
away
then
far
down
the
hillside
a
single
figure
leaped
exultantly
above
the
foliage
screen
and
in
the
distance
another
and
another
in
a
moment
the
sky
was
punctured
by
signal
rockets
one
after
another
the
little
red
puffs
became
drifting
clouds
scatter
scatter
wilma
exclaimed
in
half
an
hour
there
be
an
entire
han
fleet
here
from
and
another
from
they
get
this
instantly
on
their
recordographs
and
location
finders
blast
the
whole
valley
and
the
country
for
miles
beyond
come
tony
there
no
time
for
the
gang
to
rally
see
the
signals
we
got
to
jump
oh
i
so
proud
of
you
over
the
ridge
we
went
in
long
leaps
toward
the
east
the
country
of
the
delawares
from
time
to
time
signal
rockets
puffed
in
the
sky
most
of
them
were
the
red
warnings
the
scatter
signals
but
from
certain
of
the
others
which
wilma
identified
as
wyoming
rockets
she
gathered
that
whoever
was
in
command
we
did
not
know
whether
the
boss
was
alive
or
not
was
ordering
an
ultimate
rally
toward
the
south
and
so
we
changed
our
course
it
was
a
great
pity
i
thought
that
the
clan
had
not
been
equipped
throughout
its
membership
with
ultrophones
but
wilma
explained
to
me
that
not
enough
of
these
had
been
built
for
distribution
as
yet
although
general
distribution
had
been
contemplated
within
a
couple
of
months
we
traveled
far
before
nightfall
overtook
us
trying
only
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
ourselves
and
the
valley
when
gathering
dusk
made
jumping
too
dangerous
we
sought
a
comfortable
spot
beneath
the
trees
and
consumed
part
of
our
emergency
rations
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
tasted
the
stuff
a
highly
nutritive
synthetic
substance
called
concentro
which
was
however
a
bit
bitter
and
unpalatable
but
as
only
a
mouthful
or
so
was
needed
it
did
not
matter
neither
of
us
had
a
cloak
but
we
were
both
thoroughly
tired
and
happy
so
we
curled
up
together
for
warmth
i
remember
wilma
making
some
sleepy
remark
about
our
mating
as
she
cuddled
up
as
though
the
matter
were
all
settled
and
my
surprise
at
my
own
instant
acceptance
of
the
idea
for
i
had
not
consciously
thought
of
her
that
way
before
but
we
both
fell
asleep
at
once
in
the
morning
we
found
little
time
for
love
making
the
practical
problem
facing
us
was
too
great
wilma
felt
that
the
wyoming
plan
must
be
to
rally
in
the
susquanna
territory
but
she
had
her
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
this
plan
in
my
elation
at
my
success
in
bringing
down
the
han
ship
and
my
newly
found
interest
in
my
charming
companion
who
was
from
my
viewpoint
of
another
century
at
once
more
highly
civilized
and
yet
more
primitive
than
myself
i
had
forgotten
the
ominous
fact
that
the
han
ship
i
had
destroyed
must
have
known
the
exact
location
of
the
wyoming
works
this
meant
to
wilma
logical
mind
either
that
the
hans
had
perfected
new
instruments
as
yet
unknown
to
us
or
that
somewhere
among
the
wyomings
or
some
other
nearby
gang
there
were
traitors
so
degraded
as
to
commit
that
unthinkable
act
of
trafficking
in
information
with
the
hans
in
either
contingency
she
argued
other
han
raids
would
follow
and
since
the
susquannas
had
a
highly
developed
organization
and
more
than
usually
productive
plants
the
next
raid
might
be
expected
to
strike
them
but
at
any
rate
it
was
clearly
our
business
to
get
in
touch
with
the
other
fugitives
as
quickly
as
possible
so
in
spite
of
muscles
that
were
sore
from
the
excessive
leaping
of
the
day
before
we
continued
on
our
way
we
traveled
for
only
a
couple
of
hours
when
we
saw
a
rocket
in
the
sky
some
ten
miles
ahead
of
us
bear
to
the
left
tony
wilma
said
and
listen
for
the
whistle
why
i
asked
have
they
given
you
the
rocket
code
yet
she
replied
that
what
the
green
followed
by
yellow
and
purple
means
to
concentrate
five
miles
east
of
the
rocket
position
you
know
the
rocket
position
itself
might
draw
a
play
of
disintegrator
beams
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
reach
the
neighborhood
of
the
indicated
rallying
though
we
were
now
traveling
beneath
the
trees
with
but
an
occasional
leap
to
a
top
branch
to
see
if
any
more
rocket
smoke
was
floating
above
and
soon
we
heard
a
distant
whistle
we
found
about
half
the
gang
already
there
in
a
spot
where
the
trees
met
high
above
a
little
stream
the
big
boss
and
raid
bosses
were
busy
reorganizing
the
remnants
we
reported
to
boss
hart
at
once
he
was
silent
but
interested
when
he
heard
our
story
you
two
stick
close
to
me
he
said
adding
grimly
i
going
back
to
the
valley
at
once
with
a
hundred
picked
men
and
i
need
you
chapter
v
setting
the
trap
inside
of
fifteen
minutes
we
were
on
our
way
a
certain
amount
of
caution
was
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
speed
and
the
men
leaped
away
either
across
the
forest
top
or
over
open
spaces
of
ground
but
concentration
was
forbidden
the
big
boss
named
the
spot
on
the
hillside
as
the
rallying
point
we
have
to
take
a
chance
on
being
seen
so
long
as
we
do
group
he
declared
at
least
until
within
five
miles
of
the
rallying
spot
from
then
on
i
want
every
man
to
disappear
from
sight
and
to
travel
under
cover
and
keep
your
ultrophones
open
and
tuned
on
wilma
and
i
had
received
our
battle
equipment
from
the
gear
boss
it
consisted
of
a
a
with
a
special
case
of
ammunition
constructed
of
inertron
which
made
the
load
weigh
but
a
few
ounces
and
a
short
sword
this
gear
we
strapped
over
each
other
shoulders
on
top
of
our
jumping
belts
in
addition
we
each
received
an
ultrophone
and
a
light
inertron
blanket
rolled
into
a
cylinder
about
six
inches
long
by
two
or
three
in
diameter
this
fabric
was
exceedingly
thin
and
light
but
it
had
considerable
warmth
because
of
the
mixture
of
inertron
in
its
composition
illustration
the
han
raider
neared
with
incredible
speed
its
rays
were
both
slanted
astern
at
a
sharp
angle
so
that
it
slid
forward
with
tremendous
momentum
whenever
the
disintegrator
rays
flashed
downward
with
blinding
brilliancy
forest
rocks
and
ground
melted
instantaneously
into
nothing
where
they
played
upon
them
this
looks
like
business
wilma
remarked
to
me
with
sparkling
eyes
and
i
might
mention
a
curious
thing
here
the
word
business
had
survived
from
the
century
american
vocabulary
but
not
with
any
meaning
of
industry
or
trade
for
such
things
being
purely
community
activities
were
spoken
of
as
work
and
clearing
business
simply
meant
fighting
and
that
was
all
did
you
bring
all
this
equipment
from
the
valley
i
asked
the
gear
boss
no
he
said
there
was
no
time
to
gather
anything
all
this
stuff
we
cleared
from
the
susquannas
a
few
hours
ago
i
was
with
the
boss
on
the
way
down
and
he
had
me
jump
on
ahead
and
arrange
it
but
you
two
had
better
be
moving
he
beckoning
you
now
hart
was
about
to
call
us
on
our
phones
when
we
looked
up
as
soon
as
we
did
so
he
leaped
away
waving
us
to
follow
closely
he
was
a
powerful
man
and
he
darted
ahead
in
long
swift
low
leaps
up
the
banks
of
the
stream
which
followed
a
fairly
straight
course
at
this
point
by
extending
ourselves
however
wilma
and
i
were
able
to
catch
up
to
him
as
we
gradually
synchronized
our
leaps
with
his
he
outlined
to
us
between
the
grunts
that
accompanied
each
leap
his
plan
of
action
we
have
to
start
the
big
business
unh
sooner
or
later
he
said
and
if
unh
the
hans
have
found
any
way
of
locating
our
positions
unh
it
time
to
start
now
although
the
council
of
bosses
unh
had
intended
waiting
a
few
years
until
enough
rocket
ships
have
been
unh
built
but
no
matter
what
the
sacrifice
unh
we
afford
to
let
them
get
us
on
the
run
unh
we
set
a
trap
for
the
yellow
devils
in
the
unh
valley
if
they
come
back
for
their
wreckage
unh
and
if
they
do
we
go
rocketing
for
some
of
their
liners
unh
on
the
course
we
can
use
unh
that
idea
of
yours
of
shooting
up
the
repellor
unh
beams
want
you
to
give
us
a
demonstration
with
further
admonition
to
follow
him
closely
he
increased
his
pace
and
wilma
and
i
were
taxed
to
our
utmost
to
keep
up
with
him
it
was
only
in
ascending
the
slopes
that
my
tougher
muscles
overbalanced
his
greater
skill
and
i
was
able
to
set
the
pace
for
him
as
i
had
for
wilma
we
slept
in
greater
comfort
that
night
under
our
inertron
blankets
and
were
off
with
the
dawn
leaping
cautiously
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
overlooking
the
valley
which
wilma
and
i
had
left
the
boss
scanned
the
sky
with
his
ultroscope
patiently
taking
some
fifteen
minutes
to
the
task
and
then
swung
his
phone
into
use
calling
the
roll
and
giving
the
men
their
instructions
his
first
order
was
for
us
all
to
slip
our
ear
and
chest
discs
into
permanent
position
these
ultrophones
were
quite
different
from
the
one
used
by
companion
scout
the
day
i
saved
her
from
the
vicious
attack
of
the
bandit
gang
that
one
was
contained
entirely
in
a
small
pocket
case
these
with
which
we
were
now
equipped
consisted
of
a
pair
of
ear
discs
each
a
separate
and
receiving
set
they
slipped
into
little
pockets
over
our
ears
in
the
fabric
helmets
we
wore
and
shut
out
virtually
all
extraneous
sounds
the
chest
discs
were
likewise
sending
sets
strapped
to
the
chest
a
few
inches
below
the
neck
and
actuated
by
the
vibrations
from
the
vocal
cords
through
the
body
tissues
the
total
range
of
these
sets
was
about
eighteen
miles
reception
was
remarkably
clear
quite
free
from
the
static
that
so
marked
the
century
radios
and
of
a
strength
in
direct
proportion
to
the
distance
of
the
speaker
the
boss
set
was
triple
powered
so
that
his
orders
would
cut
in
on
any
local
conversations
which
were
indulged
in
however
with
great
restraint
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
contacts
i
marveled
at
the
efficiency
of
this
modern
method
of
battle
communication
in
contrast
to
the
clumsy
signaling
devices
of
more
ancient
times
and
also
at
other
military
contrasts
in
which
the
and
century
methods
were
the
reverse
of
each
other
in
efficiency
these
modern
americans
for
instance
knew
little
of
hand
to
hand
fighting
and
nothing
naturally
of
trench
warfare
of
barrages
they
were
quite
ignorant
although
they
possessed
weapons
of
terrific
power
and
until
my
recent
flash
of
inspiration
no
one
among
them
apparently
had
ever
thought
of
the
scheme
of
shooting
a
rocket
into
a
repellor
beam
and
letting
the
beam
itself
hurl
it
upward
into
the
most
vital
part
of
the
han
ship
hart
patiently
placed
his
men
first
giving
his
instructions
to
the
campmasters
and
then
remaining
silent
while
they
placed
the
individuals
in
the
end
the
hundred
men
were
ringed
about
the
valley
on
the
hillsides
and
tops
each
in
a
position
from
which
he
had
a
good
view
of
the
wreckage
of
the
han
ship
but
not
a
man
had
come
in
view
so
far
as
i
could
see
in
the
whole
process
the
boss
explained
to
me
that
it
was
his
idea
that
he
wilma
and
i
should
investigate
the
wreck
if
han
ships
should
appear
in
the
sky
we
would
leap
for
the
hillsides
i
suggested
to
him
to
have
the
men
set
up
their
trained
on
an
imaginary
circle
surrounding
the
wreck
he
busied
himself
with
this
after
the
three
of
us
leaped
down
to
the
han
ship
serving
as
a
target
himself
while
he
called
on
the
men
individually
to
aim
their
pieces
and
lock
them
in
position
in
the
meantime
wilma
and
i
climbed
into
the
wreckage
but
did
not
find
much
practically
all
of
the
instruments
and
machinery
had
been
twisted
out
of
all
recognizable
shape
or
utterly
destroyed
by
the
disintegrator
rays
which
apparently
had
continued
to
operate
in
the
midst
of
its
warped
remains
for
some
moments
after
the
crash
it
was
unpleasant
work
searching
the
mangled
bodies
of
the
crew
but
it
had
to
be
done
the
han
clothing
i
observed
was
quite
different
from
that
of
the
americans
and
in
many
respects
more
like
the
garb
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
life
it
was
made
of
synthetic
fabrics
like
silks
loose
and
comfortable
trousers
of
knee
length
and
sleeveless
shirts
no
protection
except
that
against
drafts
was
needed
wilma
explained
to
me
for
the
han
cities
were
entirely
enclosed
with
splendid
arrangements
for
ventilation
and
heating
these
arrangements
of
course
were
equally
adequate
in
their
airships
the
hans
indeed
had
quite
a
distaste
for
unshaded
daylight
since
their
lighting
apparatus
diffused
a
controlled
amount
of
violet
rays
making
the
unmodified
sunlight
unnecessary
for
health
and
undesirable
for
comfort
since
the
hans
did
not
have
the
secret
of
inertron
none
of
them
wore
belts
yet
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
to
bear
their
own
full
weights
at
all
times
they
were
physically
far
inferior
to
the
americans
for
they
lived
lives
of
degenerative
physical
inertia
having
machinery
of
every
description
for
the
performance
of
all
labor
and
convenient
conveyances
for
any
movement
of
more
than
a
few
steps
even
from
the
twisted
wreckage
of
this
ship
i
could
see
that
seats
chairs
and
couches
played
an
extremely
important
part
in
their
scheme
of
existence
but
none
of
the
bodies
were
overweight
they
seemed
to
have
been
the
bodies
of
men
in
good
health
but
muscularly
much
underdeveloped
wilma
explained
to
me
that
they
had
mastered
the
science
of
gland
control
and
of
course
dietetics
to
the
point
where
men
and
women
among
them
not
uncommonly
reached
the
age
of
a
hundred
years
with
arteries
and
general
health
in
splendid
condition
i
did
not
have
time
to
study
the
ship
and
its
contents
as
carefully
as
i
would
have
liked
however
time
pressed
and
it
was
our
business
to
discover
some
clue
to
the
deadly
accuracy
with
which
the
ship
had
spotted
the
wyoming
works
the
boss
had
hardly
finished
his
arrangements
for
the
ring
barrage
when
one
of
the
scouts
on
an
eminence
to
the
north
announced
the
approach
of
seven
han
ships
spread
out
in
a
great
hart
leaped
for
the
hillside
calling
to
us
to
do
likewise
but
wilma
and
i
had
raised
the
flaps
of
our
helmets
and
switched
off
our
speakers
for
conversation
between
ourselves
and
by
the
time
we
discovered
what
had
happened
the
ships
were
clearly
visible
so
fast
were
they
approaching
jump
we
heard
the
boss
order
deering
to
the
north
rogers
to
the
east
but
wilma
looked
at
me
meaningly
and
pointed
to
where
the
twisted
plates
of
the
ship
projecting
from
the
ground
offered
a
shelter
too
late
boss
she
said
they
see
us
besides
i
think
something
here
we
ought
to
look
at
it
probably
their
magnetic
graph
you
signing
your
death
warrant
hart
warned
we
risk
it
said
wilma
and
i
together
good
for
you
replied
the
boss
take
command
then
rogers
for
the
present
do
you
all
know
his
voice
boys
a
chorus
of
assent
rang
in
our
ears
and
i
began
to
do
some
fast
thinking
as
the
girl
and
i
ducked
into
the
twisted
mass
of
metal
wilma
hunt
for
that
record
i
said
knowing
that
by
the
simple
process
of
talking
i
could
keep
the
entire
command
continuously
informed
as
to
the
situation
on
the
hillsides
keep
your
guns
trained
on
the
circles
and
stand
by
on
the
hilltops
how
many
of
you
are
there
speak
in
rotation
from
bald
knob
around
to
the
east
north
west
in
turn
the
men
called
their
names
there
were
twenty
of
them
i
assigned
them
by
name
to
cover
the
various
han
ships
numbering
the
latter
from
left
to
right
train
your
rockets
on
their
repellor
rays
about
of
the
way
up
between
ships
and
ground
aim
is
more
important
than
elevation
follow
those
rays
with
your
aim
continuously
shoot
when
i
tell
you
not
before
deering
has
the
record
the
hans
probably
have
not
seen
us
or
at
least
think
there
are
but
two
of
us
in
the
valley
since
settling
without
opening
up
disintegrators
any
opinions
my
ear
discs
remained
silent
deering
and
i
remain
here
until
they
land
and
debark
stand
by
and
keep
alert
rapidly
and
easily
the
largest
of
the
han
ships
settled
to
the
earth
three
scouted
sharply
to
the
south
rising
to
a
higher
level
the
others
floated
motionless
about
a
thousand
feet
above
peeping
through
a
small
fissure
between
two
plates
i
saw
the
vast
hulk
of
the
ship
come
to
rest
full
on
the
line
of
our
prospective
ring
barrage
a
door
clanged
open
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
and
one
by
one
the
crew
emerged
chapter
vi
the
wyoming
massacre
they
coming
out
of
the
ship
i
spoke
quietly
with
my
hand
over
my
mouth
for
fear
they
might
hear
me
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
that
seems
to
be
all
who
knows
how
many
men
a
ship
like
that
is
likely
to
carry
about
ten
if
there
are
no
passengers
replied
one
of
my
men
probably
one
of
those
on
the
hillside
how
are
they
armed
i
asked
just
knives
came
the
reply
they
never
permit
on
the
ships
afraid
of
accidents
have
a
ruling
against
it
leave
them
to
us
then
i
said
for
i
had
a
hastily
formed
plan
in
my
mind
you
on
the
hillsides
take
the
ships
above
abandon
the
ring
target
divide
up
in
training
on
those
repellor
rays
you
on
the
hilltops
all
train
on
the
repellors
of
the
ships
to
the
south
shoot
at
the
word
but
not
before
wilma
crawl
over
to
your
left
where
you
can
make
a
straight
leap
for
the
door
in
that
ship
these
men
are
all
walking
around
the
wreck
in
a
bunch
when
they
on
the
far
side
i
give
the
word
and
you
leap
through
that
door
in
one
bound
i
follow
maybe
we
wo
be
seen
we
overpower
the
guard
inside
but
do
shoot
we
may
escape
being
seen
by
both
this
crew
and
ships
above
they
ca
see
over
this
wreck
it
was
so
easy
that
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
the
hans
who
had
emerged
from
the
ship
walked
round
the
wreckage
lazily
talking
in
guttural
tones
keenly
interested
in
the
wreck
but
quite
unsuspicious
at
last
they
were
on
the
far
side
in
a
moment
they
would
be
picking
their
way
into
the
wreck
wilma
leap
i
almost
whispered
the
order
the
distance
between
wilma
hiding
place
and
the
door
in
the
side
of
the
han
ship
was
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
she
was
already
crouched
with
her
feet
braced
against
a
metal
beam
taking
the
lift
of
that
wonderful
inertron
belt
into
her
calculation
she
dove
headforemost
like
a
green
projectile
through
the
door
i
followed
in
a
split
second
more
clumsily
but
no
less
speedily
bruising
my
shoulder
painfully
as
i
ricocheted
from
the
edge
of
the
opening
and
brought
up
sliding
against
the
unconscious
girl
for
she
evidently
had
hit
her
head
against
the
partition
within
the
ship
into
which
she
had
crashed
we
had
made
some
noise
within
the
ship
shuffling
footsteps
were
approaching
down
a
well
lit
gangway
any
signs
we
have
been
observed
i
asked
my
men
on
the
hillsides
not
yet
i
heard
the
boss
reply
ships
overhead
still
standing
no
beams
have
been
broken
out
men
on
ground
absorbed
in
wreck
most
of
them
have
crawled
into
it
out
of
sight
good
i
said
quickly
deering
hit
her
head
knocked
out
one
or
more
members
of
the
crew
approaching
we
not
discovered
yet
i
take
care
of
them
stand
a
bit
longer
but
be
ready
i
think
my
last
words
must
have
been
heard
by
the
man
who
was
approaching
for
he
stopped
suddenly
i
crouched
at
the
far
side
of
the
compartment
motionless
i
would
not
draw
my
sword
if
there
were
only
one
of
them
he
would
be
a
weakling
i
figured
and
i
should
easily
overcome
him
with
my
bare
hands
apparently
reassured
at
the
absence
of
any
further
sound
a
man
came
around
a
sort
of
bulkhead
and
i
leaped
i
swung
my
legs
up
in
front
of
me
as
i
did
so
catching
him
full
in
the
stomach
and
knocked
him
cold
i
ran
forward
along
the
keel
gangway
searching
for
the
control
room
i
found
it
well
up
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
and
it
was
deserted
what
could
i
do
to
jam
the
controls
of
the
ships
that
would
not
register
on
the
recording
instruments
of
the
other
ships
i
gazed
at
the
mass
of
controls
levers
and
wheels
galore
in
the
center
of
the
compartment
on
a
massively
braced
universal
joint
mounting
was
what
i
took
for
the
repellor
generator
a
dial
on
it
glowed
and
a
faint
hum
came
from
within
its
shielding
metallic
case
but
i
had
no
time
to
study
it
above
all
else
i
was
afraid
that
some
automatic
telephone
apparatus
existed
in
the
room
through
which
i
might
be
heard
on
the
other
ships
the
risk
of
trying
to
jam
the
controls
was
too
great
i
abandoned
the
idea
and
withdrew
softly
i
would
have
to
take
a
chance
that
there
was
no
other
member
of
the
crew
aboard
i
ran
back
to
the
entrance
compartment
wilma
still
lay
where
she
had
slumped
down
i
heard
the
voices
of
the
hans
approaching
it
was
time
to
act
the
next
few
seconds
would
tell
whether
the
ships
in
the
air
would
try
or
be
able
to
melt
us
into
nothingness
i
spoke
are
you
boys
all
ready
i
asked
creeping
to
a
position
opposite
the
door
and
drawing
my
again
there
was
a
chorus
of
assent
then
on
the
count
of
three
shoot
up
those
repellor
rays
all
of
them
and
for
god
sake
do
miss
and
i
counted
i
think
my
three
was
a
bit
weak
i
know
it
took
all
the
courage
i
had
to
utter
it
for
an
agonizing
instant
nothing
happened
except
that
the
landing
party
from
the
ship
strolled
into
my
range
of
vision
then
startled
they
turned
their
eyes
upward
for
an
instant
they
stood
frozen
with
horror
at
whatever
they
saw
one
hurled
his
knife
at
me
it
grazed
my
cheek
then
a
couple
of
them
made
a
break
for
the
doorway
the
rest
followed
but
i
fired
pointblank
with
my
pressing
the
button
as
fast
as
i
could
and
aiming
at
their
feet
to
make
sure
my
explosive
rockets
would
make
contact
and
do
their
work
the
detonations
of
my
rockets
were
deafening
the
spot
on
which
the
hans
stood
flashed
into
a
blinding
glare
then
there
was
nothing
there
except
their
torn
and
mutilated
corpses
they
had
been
fairly
bunched
and
i
got
them
all
i
ran
to
the
door
expecting
any
instant
to
be
hurled
into
infinity
by
the
sweep
of
a
disintegrator
ray
some
eighth
of
a
mile
away
i
saw
one
of
the
ships
crash
to
earth
a
disintegrator
ray
came
into
my
line
of
vision
wavered
uncertainly
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
sweep
directly
toward
the
ship
in
which
i
stood
but
it
never
reached
it
suddenly
like
a
light
switched
off
it
shot
to
one
side
and
a
moment
later
another
vast
hulk
crashed
to
earth
i
looked
out
then
stepped
out
on
the
ground
the
only
han
ships
in
the
sky
were
two
of
the
scouts
to
the
south
which
were
hanging
perpendicularly
and
sagging
slowly
down
the
others
must
have
crashed
down
while
i
was
deafened
by
the
sound
of
the
explosion
of
my
own
rockets
somebody
hit
the
other
repellor
ray
of
one
of
the
two
remaining
ships
and
it
fell
out
of
sight
beyond
a
hilltop
the
other
farther
away
drifted
down
diagonally
its
disintegrator
ray
playing
viciously
over
the
ground
below
it
i
shouted
with
exultation
and
relief
take
back
the
command
boss
i
yelled
his
commands
sending
out
jumpers
in
pursuit
of
the
descending
ship
rang
in
my
ears
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
them
i
leaped
back
into
the
compartment
of
the
han
ship
and
knelt
beside
my
wilma
her
padded
helmet
had
absorbed
much
of
the
blow
i
thought
otherwise
her
skull
might
have
been
fractured
oh
my
head
she
groaned
coming
to
as
i
lifted
her
gently
in
my
arms
and
strode
out
in
the
open
with
her
we
must
have
won
dearest
did
we
we
most
certainly
did
i
reassured
her
all
but
one
crashed
and
that
one
is
drifting
down
toward
the
south
we
captured
this
one
we
in
intact
there
was
only
one
member
of
the
crew
aboard
when
we
dove
in
illustration
as
the
american
leaped
he
swung
his
legs
up
in
front
of
him
catching
the
han
full
in
the
stomach
less
than
an
hour
afterward
the
big
boss
ordered
the
outfit
to
tune
in
ultrophones
on
to
pick
up
a
translated
broadcast
of
the
han
intelligence
office
in
from
the
susquanna
station
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
public
warning
and
news
item
and
read
as
follows
this
is
public
intelligence
office
broadcasting
warning
to
navigators
of
private
ships
and
news
of
public
interest
the
squadron
of
seven
ships
which
left
this
morning
to
investigate
the
recent
destruction
of
the
in
the
wyoming
valley
has
been
destroyed
by
a
series
of
mysterious
explosions
similar
to
those
which
wrecked
the
the
phones
viewplates
and
all
other
signaling
devices
of
five
of
the
seven
ships
ceased
operating
suddenly
at
approximately
the
same
moment
about
according
to
the
han
system
of
reckoning
time
seven
and
one
hundredths
after
midnight
after
violent
disturbances
the
location
finders
went
out
of
operation
electroactivity
registers
applied
to
the
territory
of
the
wyoming
valley
remain
dead
the
intelligence
office
has
no
indication
of
the
kind
of
disaster
which
overtook
the
squadron
except
certain
evidences
of
explosive
phenomena
similar
to
those
in
the
case
of
the
which
recently
went
dead
while
beaming
the
valley
in
a
systematic
effort
to
wipe
out
the
works
and
camps
of
the
tribesmen
the
office
considers
as
obvious
the
deduction
that
the
tribesmen
have
developed
a
new
and
as
yet
undetermined
technique
of
attack
on
airships
and
has
recommended
to
the
that
immediate
and
unlimited
authority
be
given
the
navigation
intelligence
division
to
make
an
investigation
of
this
technique
and
develop
a
defense
against
it
in
the
meantime
it
urges
that
private
navigators
avoid
this
territory
in
particular
and
in
general
hold
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
official
routes
which
now
are
being
patrolled
by
the
entire
force
of
the
military
office
which
is
beaming
the
routes
generously
to
a
width
of
ten
miles
the
military
office
reports
that
it
is
at
present
considering
no
retaliatory
raids
against
the
tribesmen
with
the
navigation
intelligence
division
it
holds
that
unless
further
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
disaster
is
developed
in
the
near
future
the
public
interest
will
be
better
served
and
at
smaller
cost
of
life
by
a
scientific
research
than
by
attempts
at
retaliation
which
may
bring
destruction
on
all
ships
engaging
therein
so
unless
further
evidence
actually
is
developed
or
the
orders
to
the
contrary
the
military
will
hold
to
a
defensive
policy
unofficial
intimations
from
are
to
the
effect
that
the
has
the
matter
under
consideration
the
navigation
intelligence
office
permits
the
broadcast
of
the
following
condensation
of
its
detailed
observations
the
squadron
proceeded
to
a
position
above
the
wyoming
valley
where
the
wreck
of
the
was
known
to
be
from
the
record
of
its
location
finder
before
it
went
dead
recently
there
the
bottom
projectoscope
relays
of
all
ships
registered
the
wreck
of
the
teleprojectoscope
views
of
the
wreck
and
the
bowl
of
the
valley
showed
no
evidence
of
the
presence
of
tribesmen
neither
ship
registers
nor
base
registers
showed
any
indication
of
electroactivity
except
from
the
squadron
itself
on
orders
from
the
base

commander

and
scouted
southward
at

stood
above
at

and
the
landed
to
permit
personal
inspection
of
the
wreck
by
the
science
committee
the
party
debarked
leaving
one
man
on
board
in
the
control
cabin
he
set
all
projectoscopes
at
universal
focus
except
this
meant
the
third
projectoscope
from
the
bow
of
the
ship
on
the
side
of
the
lower
deck
with
which
he
followed
the
landing
group
as
it
walked
around
the
wreck
the
first
abnormal
phenomenon
recorded
by
any
of
the
instruments
at
base
was
that
relayed
automatically
from
projectoscope
of
the
which
as
the
party
disappeared
from
view
in
back
of
the
wreck
recorded
two
green
missiles
of
roughly
cylindrical
shape
projected
from
the
wreckage
into
the
landing
compartment
of
the
ship
at
such
close
range
these
were
not
clearly
defined
owing
to
the
universal
focus
at
which
the
projectoscope
was
set
the
base
captain
of
at
once
ordered
the
man
in
the
control
room
to
investigate
and
saw
him
leave
the
control
room
in
compliance
with
this
order
an
instant
later
confused
sounds
reached
the
electrophone
such
as
might
be
made
by
a
man
falling
heavily
and
footsteps
reapproached
the
control
room
a
figure
entering
and
leaving
the
control
room
hurriedly
the
base
captain
now
believes
and
the
stills
of
the
photorecord
support
his
belief
that
this
was
not
the
crew
member
who
had
been
left
in
the
control
room
before
the
base
captain
could
speak
to
him
he
left
the
room
nor
was
any
response
given
to
the
attention
signal
the
captain
flashed
throughout
the
ship
at
this
point
projectoscope

the
ship

the
landing

walking
back
toward
the
ship

it
more
clearly
then
on
both
these
instruments
a
number
of
blinding
explosives
in
rapid
succession
were
seen

the

registered
terrific
concussions

observers
and

backed
by
the

the
explosions
as
taking
place
in
the
midst
of
the
landing
party
as
it
returned
evidently
unsuspicious
to
the
ship
then
in
rapid
succession
they
indicate
that
terrific
explosions
occurred
inside
and
outside
the
three
ships
standing
above
close
to
their
generators
and
all
signals
from
these
ships
thereupon
went

like
a

the

their

the

also
a

of
the

tumbling
and
falling
to
the
rear
wall
then
the
forward
generator
exploded
and
all
signals
went

the
fate
of

somewhat
similar
except
that
this
ship
hung
nose
down
and
drifted
on

incredible
treason
after
receiving
this
report
and
reassurances
of
support
from
the
big
bosses
of
the
neighboring
gangs
hart
determined
to
reestablish
the
wyoming
valley
community
a
careful
survey
of
the
territory
showed
that
it
was
only
the
northern
sections
and
slopes
that
had
been
beamed
by
the
first
han
ship
the
plant
had
been
partially
wiped
out
though
the
lower
levels
underground
had
not
been
reached
by
the
dis
ray
the
forest
screen
above
it
however
had
been
annihilated
and
it
was
determined
to
abandon
it
after
removing
all
usable
machinery
and
evidences
of
the
processes
that
might
be
of
interest
to
the

scientists
should
they
return
to
the

in
the
future
the
ammunition
plant
and
the
plant
which
had
just
been
about
to
start
operation
at
the
time
of
the
raid
were
intact
as
were
the
other
important
plants

brought
the
camboss
up
from
the
susquanna
works
and
laid
out
new
camp
locations
scattering
them
farther
to
the
south
and
avoiding
ground
which
had
been
seared
by
the
han
beams
and
the
immediate
locations
of
the

wrecks
during
this
period
a
sharp
check
was
kept
upon

messages
for
the
phone
plant
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
be
put
in
operation
and
when
it
became
evident
that
the
hans
did
not
intend
any
immediate
reprisals
the
entire
membership
of
the
community
was
summoned
back
and
normal
life
was
resumed
wilma
and
i
had
been
married
the
day
after
the
destruction
of
the
ships
and
spent
this
intervening
period
in
a
delightful
honeymoon
camping
high
in
the
mountains
on
our
return
we
had
a
camp
of
our
own
of
course
we
were
assigned
to
location
and
as
might
be
expected
we
had
a
great
deal
of
banter
over
which
one
of
us
was
camp
boss
the
title
stood
after
my
name
on
the
big
boss
records
and
those
of
the
big
camboss
of
course
but
wilma
airily
held
that
this
meant
nothing
at
all
and
generally
succeeded
in
making
me
admit
it
whenever
she
chose
i
found
myself
a
member
of
the
gang
now
for
i
had
elected
to
search
no
farther
for
a
permanent
alliance
much
as
i
would
have
liked
to
familiarize
myself
with
this
century
life
in
other
sections
of
the
country
the
wyomings
had
a
high
morale
and
had
prospered
under
the
rule
of
big
boss
hart
for
many
years
but
many
of
the
gangs
i
found
were
badly
organized
lacked
strong
hands
in
authority
and
were
rife
with
intrigue
on
the
whole
i
thought
i
would
be
wise
to
stay
with
a
group
which
had
already
proved
its
friendliness
and
in
which
i
seemed
to
have
prospects
of
advancement
under
these
modern
social
and
economic
conditions
the
kind
of
individual
freedom
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
in
the
century
was
impossible
i
would
have
been
as
much
of
a
nonentity
in
every
phase
of
human
relationship
by
attempting
to
avoid
alliances
as
any
man
of
the
century
would
have
been
politically
who
aligned
himself
with
no
political
party
this
entire
modern
life
it
appeared
to
me
judging
from
my
ancient
viewpoint
was
organized
along
what
i
called
political
lines
and
in
this
connection
it
amused
me
to
notice
how
universal
had
become
the
use
of
the
word
boss
the
leader
the
person
in
charge
or
authority
over
anything
was
a
boss
there
was
as
little
formality
in
his
relations
with
his
followers
as
there
was
in
the
case
of
the
century
political
boss
and
the
same
high
respect
paid
him
by
his
followers
as
well
as
the
same
high
consideration
by
him
of
their
interests
he
was
just
as
much
of
an
autocrat
and
just
as
much
dependent
upon
the
general
popularity
of
his
actions
for
the
ability
to
maintain
his
autocracy
the
who
could
not
command
the
loyalty
of
his
followers
was
as
quickly
deposed
either
by
them
or
by
his
superiors
as
the
ancient
ward
leader
of
the
century
who
lost
control
of
his
votes
as
society
was
organized
in
the
century
i
do
not
believe
the
system
could
have
worked
in
anything
but
politics
i
tremble
to
think
what
would
have
happened
had
the
attempt
been
made
to
handle
the
this
way
during
the
first
world
war
instead
of
by
that
rigid
military
discipline
and
complete
assumption
of
the
individual
as
a
mere
standardized
cog
in
the
machine
but
owing
to
the
centuries
of
desperate
suffering
the
people
had
endured
at
the
hands
of
the
hans
there
developed
a
spirit
of
and
consideration
for
the
common
good
that
made
the
scheme
applicable
and
efficient
in
all
forms
of
human
i
have
a
little
heresy
about
all
this
however
my
associates
regard
the
thought
with
as
much
horror
as
many
worthy
people
of
the
century
felt
in
regard
to
any
heretical
suggestion
that
the
original
outline
of
government
as
laid
down
in
the
first
constitution
did
not
apply
as
well
to
century
conditions
as
to
those
of
the
early
in
later
years
i
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
softening
of
moral
fiber
among
the
people
since
the
hans
had
been
finally
destroyed
with
all
their
works
and
americans
have
developed
a
new
luxury
economy
i
have
seen
signs
of
the
reawakening
of
greed
of
selfishness
the
eternal
cycle
seems
to
be
at
work
i
fear
that
slowly
though
surely
private
wealth
is
reappearing
codes
of
inflexibility
are
developing
they
will
be
followed
by
corruption
degradation
and
in
the
end
some
cataclysmic
event
will
end
this
era
and
usher
in
a
new
one
all
this
however
is
wandering
afar
from
my
story
which
concerns
our
early
battles
against
the
hans
and
not
our
more
modern
problems
of
our
victory
over
the
seven
han
ships
had
set
the
country
ablaze
the
secret
had
been
carefully
communicated
to
the
other
gangs
and
the
country
was
agog
from
one
end
to
the
other
there
was
feverish
activity
in
the
ammunition
plants
and
the
hunting
of
stray
han
ships
became
an
enthusiastic
sport
the
results
were
disastrous
to
our
hereditary
enemies
from
the
pacific
coast
came
the
report
of
a
great
transpacific
liner
of
tons
lift
being
brought
to
earth
from
a
position
of
invisibility
above
the
clouds
a
dozen
sacramentos
had
caught
the
hazy
outlines
of
its
rep
rays
approaching
them
in
the
twilight
like
ghostly
pillars
reaching
into
the
sky
they
had
fired
rockets
into
it
with
ease
whereas
they
would
have
had
difficulty
in
hitting
it
if
it
had
been
moving
at
right
angles
to
their
position
they
got
one
rep
ray
the
other
was
not
strong
enough
to
hold
it
up
it
floated
to
earth
nose
down
and
since
it
was
unarmed
and
unarmored
they
had
no
difficulty
in
shooting
it
to
pieces
and
massacring
its
crew
and
passengers
it
seemed
barbarous
to
me
but
then
i
did
not
have
centuries
of
bitter
persecution
in
my
blood
from
the
jersey
beaches
we
received
news
of
the
destruction
of
a
liner
the
practically
invisible
in
their
clothing
and
half
buried
along
the
beaches
lay
in
wait
for
days
risking
the
play
of
dis
beams
along
the
route
and
finally
registering
four
hits
within
a
week
the
hans
discontinued
their
service
along
this
route
and
as
evidence
that
they
were
badly
shaken
by
our
success
sent
no
raiders
down
the
beaches
it
was
a
few
weeks
later
that
big
boss
hart
sent
for
me
tony
he
said
there
are
two
things
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
one
of
them
will
become
public
property
in
a
few
days
i
think
we
going
to
get
any
more
han
ships
by
shooting
up
their
repellor
rays
unless
we
use
much
larger
rockets
they
are
wise
to
us
now
putting
armor
of
great
thickness
in
the
hulls
of
their
ships
below
the
machines
near
this
morning
a
party
of
eries
shot
one
without
success
the
explosions
staggered
her
but
did
not
penetrate
as
near
as
we
can
gather
from
their
reports
their
laboratories
have
developed
a
new
alloy
of
great
tensile
strength
and
elasticity
which
nevertheless
lets
the
rep
rays
through
like
a
sieve
our
reports
indicate
that
the
eries
rockets
bounced
off
harmlessly
most
of
the
party
was
wiped
out
as
the
dis
rays
went
into
action
on
them
this
is
going
to
mean
real
business
for
all
of
the
gangs
before
long
the
big
bosses
have
just
held
a
national
ultrophone
council
it
was
decided
that
america
must
organize
on
a
national
basis
the
first
move
is
to
develop
sectional
organization
by
zones
i
have
been
made
superboss
of
the
zone
we
in
for
it
now
the
hans
are
sure
to
launch
reprisal
expeditions
if
we
to
save
the
race
we
must
keep
them
away
from
our
camps
and
plants
i
thinking
of
developing
a
permanent
field
force
along
the
lines
of
the
regular
armies
of
the
century
you
told
me
about
its
business
will
be
twofold
to
carry
the
warfare
as
much
as
possible
to
the
hans
and
to
serve
as
a
decoy
to
keep
their
attention
from
our
plants
i
going
to
need
your
help
in
this
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
is
this
amazing
and
impossible
as
it
seems
there
is
a
group
or
perhaps
an
entire
gang
somewhere
among
us
that
is
betraying
us
to
the
hans
it
may
be
the
bad
bloods
or
it
may
be
one
of
those
gangs
who
live
near
one
of
the
han
cities
you
know
a
hundred
and
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
there
were
certain
of
these
people
ancestors
who
actually
degraded
themselves
by
mating
with
the
hans
sometimes
even
serving
them
as
slaves
in
the
days
before
they
brought
all
their
service
machinery
to
perfection
there
is
such
a
gang
called
the
nagras
up
near
and
another
in
that
men
call
the
pineys
but
i
hardly
suspect
the
pineys
there
is
little
intelligence
among
them
they
would
have
the
information
to
give
the
hans
nor
would
they
be
capable
of
imparting
it
they
absolute
savages
just
what
evidence
is
there
that
anybody
has
been
clearing
information
to
the
hans
i
asked
well
he
replied
first
of
all
there
was
that
raid
upon
us
that
first
han
ship
knew
the
location
of
our
plants
exactly
you
remember
it
floated
directly
into
position
above
the
valley
and
began
a
systematic
beaming
then
the
hans
quite
obviously
have
learned
that
we
are
picking
up
their
electrophone
waves
for
they
gone
back
to
their
old
but
extremely
accurate
system
of
directional
control
but
we
been
getting
them
for
the
past
week
by
installing
automatic
units
along
the
scar
paths
this
is
what
the
americans
called
those
strips
of
country
directly
under
the
regular
ship
routes
of
the
hans
who
as
a
matter
of
precaution
frequently
blasted
them
with
their
dis
beams
to
prevent
the
growth
of
foliage
which
might
give
shelter
to
the
americans
but
they
been
beaming
those
paths
so
hard
it
looks
as
though
they
even
had
information
of
this
strategy
and
in
addition
they
been
using
code
finally
we
picked
up
three
of
their
messages
in
which
they
discuss
with
some
nervousness
the
existence
of
our
ultrophone
but
they
still
have
no
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
control
of
ultronic
activity
i
asked
no
said
the
big
boss
thoughtfully
they
do
seem
to
have
a
bit
of
information
about
it
then
it
quite
clear
i
ventured
that
whoever
is
us
to
them
is
doing
it
piecemeal
it
sounds
like
a
bit
of
occasional
barter
rather
than
an
alliance
they
holding
back
as
much
information
as
possible
for
future
bartering
perhaps
yes
hart
said
and
it
is
information
the
hans
are
giving
in
return
but
some
form
of
goods
or
privilege
the
trick
would
be
to
locate
the
goods
i
guess
i
have
to
make
a
personal
trip
around
among
the
big
bosses
chapter
viii
the
han
city
this
conversation
set
me
thinking
all
of
the
han
electrophone
had
been
an
open
record
to
the
americans
for
a
good
many
years
and
the
hans
were
just
finding
it
out
for
centuries
they
had
not
regarded
us
as
any
sort
of
a
menace
unquestionably
it
had
never
occurred
to
them
to
secrete
their
own
records
somewhere
in
or
or
possibly
in
itself
the
record
of
this
traitorous
transaction
would
be
more
or
less
openly
filed
if
we
could
only
get
at
it
i
wondered
if
a
raid
might
not
be
possible
bill
hearn
and
i
talked
it
over
with
our
boss
and
his
experts
there
ensued
several
days
of
research
in
which
the
han
records
of
the
entire
decade
were
scanned
and
analyzed
in
the
end
they
picked
out
a
mass
of
detail
and
fitted
it
together
into
a
very
definite
picture
of
the
great
central
filing
office
of
the
hans
in
where
the
entire
mass
of
official
records
was
kept
constantly
available
for
instant
projectoscoping
to
any
of
the
city
offices
and
of
the
system
by
which
the
information
was
filed
the
attempt
began
to
look
feasible
though
hart
instantly
turned
the
idea
down
when
i
first
presented
it
to
him
it
was
unthinkable
he
said
sheer
suicide
but
in
the
end
i
persuaded
him
i
will
need
i
said
blash
who
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
han
library
system
bert
gaunt
who
for
years
has
specialized
on
their
military
offices
bill
barker
the
ray
specialist
and
the
best
swooper
pilot
we
have
are
and
ships
developed
by
the
americans
with
skeleton
backbones
of
inertron
during
the
war
painted
green
for
invisibility
against
the
green
forests
below
and
bellies
of
clear
ultron
that
will
be
mort
gibbons
said
hart
we
only
got
three
swoopers
left
tony
but
i
risk
one
of
them
if
you
and
the
others
will
voluntarily
risk
your
existences
but
mind
i
wo
urge
or
order
one
of
you
to
go
i
spread
the
word
to
every
plant
boss
at
once
to
give
you
anything
and
everything
you
need
in
the
way
of
equipment
when
i
told
wilma
of
the
plan
i
expected
her
to
raise
violent
and
tearful
objections
but
she
did
she
was
made
of
far
sterner
stuff
than
the
women
of
the
century
not
that
she
could
weep
as
copiously
or
be
just
as
whimsical
on
occasion
but
she
would
weep
for
the
same
reasons
she
just
gave
me
an
unfathomable
look
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
pride
and
asked
eagerly
for
the
details
i
confess
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
that
she
could
so
courageously
risk
my
loss
even
though
i
was
amazed
at
her
fortitude
but
later
i
was
to
learn
how
little
i
knew
her
then
we
were
ready
to
slide
off
at
dawn
the
next
morning
i
had
kissed
wilma
at
our
camp
and
after
a
final
conference
over
our
plans
we
boarded
our
craft
and
gently
glided
away
over
the
tree
tops
on
a
course
which
after
crossing
three
routes
of
the
han
ships
would
take
us
out
over
the
atlantic
off
the
jersey
coast
whence
we
would
come
up
on
from
the
ocean
twice
we
had
to
nose
down
and
lie
motionless
on
the
ground
near
a
route
while
han
ships
passed
those
were
tense
moments
had
the
green
back
of
our
ship
been
observed
we
would
have
been
disintegrated
in
a
second
but
it
was
once
over
the
water
however
we
climbed
in
a
great
spiral
ten
miles
in
diameter
until
our
altimeter
registered
ten
miles
here
gibbons
shut
off
his
rocket
motor
and
we
floated
far
above
the
level
of
the
atlantic
liners
whose
course
was
well
to
the
north
of
us
anyhow
and
waited
for
nightfall
then
gibbons
turned
from
his
control
long
enough
to
grin
at
me
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
tony
he
said
throwing
back
the
lid
of
what
i
had
supposed
was
a
big
supply
case
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
wilma
stepped
out
of
the
case
if
you
into
zero
a
common
expression
of
the
day
for
being
annihilated
by
the
disintegrator
ray
you
do
think
i
going
to
let
you
go
alone
do
you
tony
i
could
believe
my
ears
last
night
when
you
spoke
of
going
without
me
until
i
realized
that
you
are
still
five
hundred
years
behind
the
times
in
lots
of
ways
do
you
know
dear
heart
that
you
offered
me
the
greatest
insult
a
husband
could
give
a
wife
you
did
of
course
the
others
it
seemed
had
all
been
in
on
the
secret
and
now
they
would
have
kidded
me
unmercifully
except
that
wilma
eyes
blazed
dangerously
at
nightfall
we
maneuvered
to
a
position
directly
above
the
city
this
took
some
time
and
calculation
on
the
part
of
bill
barker
who
explained
to
me
that
he
had
to
determine
our
point
by
ultronic
bearings
the
slightest
resort
to
an
electronic
instrument
he
feared
might
be
detected
by
our
enemies
locators
in
fact
we
did
not
dare
bring
our
swooper
any
lower
than
five
miles
for
fear
that
its
capacity
might
be
reflected
in
their
instruments
finally
however
he
succeeded
in
locating
above
the
central
tower
of
the
city
if
my
calculations
are
as
much
as
ten
feet
off
he
remarked
with
confidence
i
eat
the
tower
now
the
rest
is
up
to
you
mort
see
what
you
can
do
to
hold
her
steady
no
here
watch
this
indicator
the
red
beam
not
the
green
one
see
if
you
keep
it
exactly
centered
on
the
needle
you
the
width
of
the
beam
represents
seventeen
feet
the
tower
platform
is
fifty
feet
square
so
we
got
a
good
margin
to
work
on
for
several
moments
we
watched
as
gibbons
bent
over
his
levers
constantly
adjusting
them
with
deft
touches
of
his
fingers
after
a
bit
of
wavering
the
beam
remained
centered
on
the
needle
now
i
said
let
drop
i
opened
the
trap
and
looked
down
but
quickly
shut
it
again
when
i
felt
the
air
rushing
out
of
the
ship
into
the
rarefied
atmosphere
in
a
torrent
gibbons
literally
yelled
a
protest
from
his
instrument
board
i
forgot
i
mumbled
silly
of
me
of
course
we
have
to
drop
out
of
compartment
the
compartment
to
which
i
referred
was
similar
to
those
in
some
of
the
century
submarines
we
all
entered
it
there
was
barely
room
for
us
to
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
some
struggles
we
got
into
our
special
air
helmets
and
adjusted
the
pressure
at
our
signal
gibbons
exhausted
the
air
in
the
compartment
pumping
it
into
the
body
of
the
ship
and
as
the
little
signal
light
flashed
wilma
threw
open
the
hatch
setting
the
reel
i
climbed
through
and
began
to
slide
down
gently
we
all
had
our
belts
on
of
course
adjusted
to
a
weight
balance
of
but
a
few
ounces
and
the
reel
of
ultron
wire
that
was
to
be
our
guide
was
of
gossamer
fineness
though
anyway
i
believe
it
would
have
lifted
the
full
weight
of
the
five
of
us
so
strong
and
tough
was
this
invisible
metal
as
an
extra
precaution
since
the
wire
was
of
the
purest
metal
and
therefore
totally
invisible
even
in
daylight
we
all
had
our
belts
hooked
on
small
rings
that
slid
down
the
wire
i
went
down
with
the
end
of
the
wire
wilma
followed
a
few
feet
above
me
then
barker
gaunt
and
blash
gibbons
of
course
stayed
behind
to
hold
the
ship
in
position
and
control
the
paying
out
of
the
line
we
all
had
our
ultrophones
in
place
inside
our
air
helmets
and
so
could
converse
with
one
another
and
with
gibbons
but
at
wilma
suggestion
although
we
would
have
liked
to
let
the
big
boss
listen
in
we
kept
them
adjusted
to
work
for
fear
that
those
who
had
been
clearing
with
the
hans
and
against
whom
we
were
on
a
raid
for
evidence
might
also
pick
up
our
conversation
we
had
no
fear
that
the
hans
would
hear
us
in
fact
we
had
the
added
advantage
that
even
after
we
landed
we
could
converse
freely
without
danger
of
their
hearing
our
voices
through
our
air
helmets
for
a
while
i
could
see
nothing
below
but
utter
darkness
then
i
realized
from
the
feel
of
the
air
as
much
as
from
anything
that
we
were
sinking
through
a
cloud
layer
we
passed
through
two
more
cloud
layers
before
anything
was
visible
to
us
then
there
came
under
my
gaze
about
two
miles
below
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sights
i
have
ever
seen
the
soft
yet
brilliant
radiance
of
the
great
han
city
of
every
foot
of
its
structural
members
seemed
to
glow
with
a
wonderful
incandescence
tower
piled
up
on
tower
and
all
built
on
the
vast
of
the
city
which
so
i
had
been
told
sheered
upward
from
the
surface
of
the
rivers
to
a
height
of
levels
the
city
i
noticed
with
some
surprise
did
not
cover
anything
like
the
same
area
as
the
new
york
of
the
century
it
occupied
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
the
lower
half
of
manhattan
island
with
one
section
straddling
the
east
river
and
spreading
out
sufficiently
over
what
once
had
been
brooklyn
to
provide
berths
for
the
great
liners
and
other
air
craft
straight
beneath
my
feet
was
a
tiny
dark
patch
it
seemed
the
only
spot
in
the
entire
city
that
was
not
aflame
with
radiance
this
was
the
central
tower
in
the
top
floors
of
which
were
housed
the
vast
library
of
record
files
and
the
main
projectoscope
plant
you
can
shoot
the
wire
now
i
ultrophoned
gibbons
and
let
go
the
little
weighted
knob
it
dropped
like
a
plummet
and
we
followed
with
considerable
speed
but
braking
our
descent
with
gloved
hands
sufficiently
to
see
whether
the
knob
on
which
a
faint
light
glowed
as
a
signal
for
ourselves
might
be
observed
by
any
han
guard
or
night
prowler
apparently
it
was
not
and
we
again
shot
down
with
accelerated
speed
we
landed
on
the
roof
of
the
tower
without
any
mishap
and
fortunately
for
our
plan
in
darkness
since
there
was
nothing
above
it
on
which
it
would
have
been
worth
while
to
shed
illumination
or
from
which
there
was
any
need
to
observe
it
the
hans
had
neglected
to
light
the
tower
roof
or
indeed
to
occupy
it
at
all
this
was
the
reason
we
had
selected
it
as
our
landing
place
as
soon
as
gibbons
had
our
word
he
extinguished
the
knob
light
and
the
knob
as
well
as
the
wire
became
totally
invisible
at
our
ultrophoned
word
he
would
light
it
again
no
gun
play
now
i
warned
swords
only
and
then
only
if
absolutely
necessary
closely
bunched
and
treading
as
lightly
as
only
people
could
we
made
our
way
cautiously
through
a
door
and
down
an
inclined
plane
to
the
floor
below
where
gaunt
and
blash
assured
us
the
military
offices
were
located
twice
barker
cautioned
us
to
stop
as
we
were
about
to
pass
in
front
of
windows
in
the
passage
wall
and
flattening
ourselves
to
the
floor
we
crawled
past
them
projectoscopes
he
said
probably
on
automatic
record
only
at
this
time
of
night
still
we
do
want
to
leave
any
records
for
them
to
study
after
we
gone
were
you
ever
here
before
i
asked
no
he
replied
but
i
have
been
studying
their
electrophone
communications
for
seven
years
without
being
able
to
recognize
these
machines
when
i
run
across
them
chapter
ix
the
fight
in
the
tower
so
far
we
had
not
laid
eyes
on
a
han
the
tower
seemed
deserted
blash
and
gaunt
however
assured
me
that
there
would
be
at
least
one
man
on
duty
in
the
military
offices
though
he
would
probably
be
asleep
and
two
or
three
in
the
library
proper
and
the
projectoscope
plant
we
got
to
put
them
out
of
commission
i
said
did
you
bring
the
cans
wilma
yes
she
said
two
for
each
here
and
she
distributed
them
we
were
now
two
levels
below
the
roof
and
at
the
point
where
we
were
to
separate
i
did
not
want
to
let
wilma
out
of
my
sight
but
it
was
necessary
according
to
our
plan
barker
was
to
make
his
way
to
the
projectoscope
plant
blash
and
i
to
the
library
and
wilma
and
gaunt
to
the
military
office
blash
and
i
traversed
a
long
corridor
and
paused
at
the
great
arched
doorway
of
the
library
cautiously
we
peered
in
seated
at
three
great
switchboards
were
library
operatives
occasionally
one
of
them
would
reach
lazily
for
a
lever
or
sleepily
push
a
button
as
little
numbered
lights
winked
on
and
off
they
were
answering
calls
for
electrograph
and
viewplate
records
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
from
all
sections
of
the
city
i
apprised
my
companions
of
the
situation
better
wait
a
bit
blash
added
the
calls
will
lessen
shortly
wilma
reported
an
officer
in
the
military
office
sound
asleep
give
him
the
can
then
i
said
barker
was
to
do
nothing
more
than
keep
watch
in
the
projectoscope
plant
and
a
few
moments
later
he
reported
himself
well
concealed
with
a
splendid
view
of
the
floor
i
think
we
can
take
a
chance
now
blash
said
to
me
and
at
my
nod
he
opened
the
lid
of
his
dope
can
of
course
the
fumes
did
not
affect
us
through
our
helmets
they
were
absolutely
without
odor
or
visibility
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
librarians
were
unconscious
we
stepped
into
the
room
there
ensued
considerable
cautious
observation
and
experiment
on
the
part
of
gaunt
working
from
the
military
office
and
blash
in
the
library
while
wilma
and
i
with
drawn
swords
and
sharply
attuned
microphones
stood
guard
and
occasionally
patrolled
nearby
corridors
i
hear
something
approaching
wilma
said
after
a
bit
with
excitement
in
her
voice
it
a
soft
gliding
sound
that
an
elevator
somewhere
barker
cut
in
from
the
projectoscope
floor
can
you
locate
it
i
ca
hear
it
it
to
the
east
of
me
she
replied
and
to
my
west
said
i
faintly
catching
it
it
between
us
wilma
and
nearer
you
than
me
be
careful
have
you
got
any
information
yet
blash
and
gaunt
getting
it
now
one
of
them
replied
give
us
two
minutes
more
keep
at
it
then
i
said
we
guard
the
soft
gliding
sound
ceased
i
think
it
very
close
to
me
wilma
almost
whispered
come
closer
tony
i
have
a
feeling
something
is
going
to
happen
i
never
known
my
nerves
to
get
taut
like
this
without
reason
in
some
alarm
i
launched
myself
down
the
corridor
in
a
great
leap
toward
the
intersection
whence
i
knew
i
could
see
her
in
the
middle
of
my
leap
my
ultrophone
registered
her
gasp
of
alarm
the
next
instant
i
glided
to
a
stop
at
the
intersection
to
see
wilma
backing
toward
the
door
of
the
military
office
her
sword
red
with
blood
and
an
inert
form
on
the
corridor
floor
two
other
hans
were
circling
to
either
side
of
her
with
knives
while
a
third
evidently
a
high
officer
judging
by
the
resplendence
of
his
garb
tugged
desperately
to
get
an
electrophone
instrument
out
of
a
bulky
pocket
if
he
ever
gave
the
alarm
there
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
to
us
i
was
at
least
seventy
feet
away
but
i
crouched
low
and
sprang
with
every
bit
of
strength
in
my
legs
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
i
dived
for
i
reached
the
fellow
head
on
with
no
attempt
to
draw
my
legs
beneath
me
some
instinct
must
have
warned
him
for
he
turned
suddenly
as
i
hurtled
close
to
him
but
by
this
time
i
had
sunk
close
to
the
floor
and
had
stiffened
myself
rigidly
lest
a
dragging
knee
or
foot
might
just
prevent
my
reaching
him
i
brought
my
blade
upward
and
over
it
was
a
vicious
slash
that
laid
him
open
bisecting
him
from
groin
to
chin
and
his
dead
body
toppled
down
on
me
as
i
slid
to
a
tangled
stop
the
other
two
startled
turned
wilma
leaped
at
one
and
struck
him
down
with
a
side
slash
i
looked
up
at
this
instant
and
the
dazed
fear
on
his
face
at
the
length
of
her
leap
registered
vividly
the
hans
knew
nothing
of
our
inertron
belts
it
seemed
and
these
leaps
and
dives
of
ours
filled
them
with
terror
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
a
gory
mess
wilma
with
a
poise
and
speed
which
i
found
time
to
admire
even
in
this
crisis
again
leaped
this
time
she
dove
head
first
as
i
had
done
and
with
a
beautifully
executed
thrust
ran
the
last
han
through
the
throat
uncertainly
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
staggered
queerly
and
then
sank
gently
prone
on
the
corridor
she
had
fainted
at
this
juncture
blash
and
gaunt
reported
with
elation
that
they
had
the
record
we
wanted
back
to
the
roof
everybody
i
ordered
as
i
picked
wilma
up
in
my
arms
with
her
inertron
belt
she
felt
as
light
as
a
feather
gaunt
joined
me
at
once
from
the
military
office
and
at
the
intersection
of
the
corridor
we
came
upon
blash
waiting
for
us
barker
however
was
not
in
evidence
where
are
you
barker
i
called
go
ahead
he
replied
i
be
with
you
on
the
roof
at
once
we
came
out
in
the
open
without
any
further
mishap
and
i
instructed
gibbons
in
the
ship
to
light
the
knob
on
the
end
of
the
ultron
wire
it
flashed
dully
a
few
feet
away
from
us
just
how
he
had
maneuvered
the
ship
to
keep
our
end
of
the
line
in
position
without
its
swinging
in
a
tremendous
arc
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
had
not
the
night
been
an
unusually
still
one
he
could
not
have
checked
the
initial
movements
as
it
was
there
was
considerable
air
current
at
certain
of
the
levels
and
in
different
directions
too
but
gibbons
was
an
expert
of
rare
ability
and
sensitivity
in
the
handling
of
a
rocket
ship
and
he
managed
with
the
aid
of
his
delicate
instruments
to
sense
the
drifts
almost
before
they
affected
the
fine
ultron
wire
and
to
neutralize
them
with
little
shifts
in
the
position
of
the
ship
blash
and
gaunt
fastened
their
rings
to
the
wire
and
i
hooked
my
own
and
wilma
on
too
but
on
looking
around
i
found
barker
was
still
missing
barker
come
i
called
we
waiting
coming
he
replied
and
indeed
at
that
instant
his
figure
appeared
up
the
ramp
he
chuckled
as
he
fastened
his
ring
to
the
wire
and
said
something
about
a
little
surprise
he
had
left
for
the
hans
do
reel
in
the
wire
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
i
instructed
gibbons
it
will
take
too
long
to
wind
it
in
we
float
up
and
when
we
aboard
we
can
drop
it
in
order
to
float
up
we
had
to
dispense
with
a
pound
or
two
of
weight
apiece
we
hurled
our
swords
from
us
and
kicked
off
our
shoes
as
gibbons
reeled
up
the
line
a
bit
and
then
letting
go
of
the
wire
began
to
hum
upward
on
our
rings
with
increasing
velocity
the
rush
of
air
brought
wilma
to
and
i
hastily
explained
to
her
that
we
had
been
successful
receding
far
below
us
now
i
could
see
our
dully
shining
knob
swinging
to
and
fro
in
an
ever
widening
arc
as
it
crossed
and
recrossed
the
black
square
of
the
tower
roof
as
an
extra
precaution
i
ordered
gibbons
to
shut
off
the
light
and
to
show
one
from
the
belly
of
the
ship
for
so
great
was
our
speed
now
that
i
began
to
fear
we
would
have
difficulty
in
checking
ourselves
we
were
literally
falling
upward
and
with
terrific
acceleration
fortunately
we
had
several
minutes
in
which
to
solve
this
difficulty
which
none
of
us
strangely
enough
had
foreseen
it
was
gibbons
who
found
the
answer
you
be
all
right
if
all
of
you
grab
the
wire
tight
when
i
give
the
word
he
said
first
i
start
reeling
it
in
at
full
speed
you
get
much
of
a
jar
and
then
i
decrease
its
speed
again
gradually
and
its
weight
will
hold
you
back
are
you
ready
one
two
three
we
all
grabbed
tightly
with
our
gloved
hands
as
he
gave
the
word
we
must
have
been
rising
a
good
bit
faster
than
he
figured
however
for
it
wrenched
our
arms
considerably
and
the
maneuver
set
up
a
sickening
pendulum
motion
for
a
while
all
we
could
do
was
swing
there
in
an
arc
that
may
have
been
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
about
three
and
a
half
miles
above
the
city
and
still
more
than
a
mile
from
our
ship
gibbons
skilfully
took
up
the
slack
as
our
momentum
pulled
up
the
line
then
at
last
we
had
ourselves
under
control
again
and
continued
our
upward
journey
checking
our
speed
somewhat
with
our
gloves
there
was
not
one
of
us
who
did
not
breathe
a
big
sigh
of
relief
when
we
scrambled
through
the
hatch
safely
into
the
ship
again
cast
off
the
ultron
line
and
slammed
the
trap
shut
little
realizing
that
we
had
a
still
more
terrible
experience
to
go
through
we
discussed
the
information
blash
and
gaunt
had
between
them
extracted
from
the
han
records
and
the
advisability
of
ultrophoning
hart
at
once
chapter
x
the
walls
of
hell
the
traitors
were
it
seemed
a
degenerate
gang
of
americans
located
a
few
miles
north
of
on
the
wooded
banks
of
the
hudson
the
sinsings
they
had
exchanged
scraps
of
information
to
the
hans
in
return
for
several
old
machines
and
the
privilege
of
tuning
in
on
the
han
electronic
power
broadcast
for
their
operation
provided
their
ships
agreed
to
subject
themselves
to
the
orders
of
the
han
traffic
office
while
aloft
the
rest
wanted
to
ultrophone
their
news
at
once
since
there
was
always
danger
that
we
might
never
get
back
to
the
gang
with
it
i
objected
however
the
sinsings
would
be
likely
to
pick
up
our
message
even
if
we
used
the
directional
projector
they
might
have
scouts
out
to
the
west
and
south
in
the
big
stretches
of
country
they
would
flee
to
and
escape
the
punishment
they
merited
it
seemed
to
be
vitally
important
that
they
should
not
for
the
sake
of
example
to
other
weak
groups
among
the
american
gangs
as
well
as
to
prevent
a
crisis
in
which
they
might
clear
more
vital
information
to
the
enemy
out
to
sea
again
i
ordered
gibbons
they
be
less
likely
to
look
for
us
in
that
direction
easy
boss
easy
he
replied
wait
until
we
get
up
a
mile
or
two
more
they
must
have
discovered
evidences
of
our
raid
by
now
and
their
wall
may
go
in
operation
any
moment
even
as
he
spoke
the
ship
lurched
downward
and
to
one
side
there
it
is
he
shouted
hang
on
everybody
we
going
to
nose
straight
up
and
he
flipped
the
control
wide
open
looking
through
one
of
the
rear
ports
i
could
see
a
nebulous
luminous
ring
and
on
all
sides
the
atmosphere
took
on
a
faint
iridescence
we
were
almost
over
the
destructive
range
of
the
wall
a
hollow
cylinder
of
annihilation
shooting
upward
from
a
solid
ring
of
generators
surrounding
the
city
it
was
the
main
defense
system
of
the
hans
which
had
never
been
used
except
in
periodic
tests
they
may
or
may
not
have
suspected
that
an
american
rocket
ship
was
within
the
cylinder
probably
they
had
turned
on
their
generators
more
as
a
precaution
to
prevent
any
reaching
a
position
above
the
city
but
even
at
our
present
great
height
we
were
in
great
danger
it
was
a
question
how
much
we
might
have
been
harmed
by
the
rays
themselves
for
their
effective
range
was
not
much
more
than
seven
or
eight
miles
the
greater
danger
lay
in
the
terrific
downward
rush
of
air
within
the
cylinder
to
replace
that
which
was
being
burned
into
nothingness
by
the
continual
play
of
the
disintegrators
the
air
fell
into
the
cylinder
with
the
force
of
a
gale
it
would
be
rushing
toward
the
wall
from
the
outside
with
terrific
force
also
but
naturally
the
effect
was
intensified
on
the
interior
our
ship
vibrated
and
trembled
we
had
only
one
chance
of
escape
to
fight
our
way
well
above
the
current
to
drift
down
with
it
meant
ultimately
and
inevitably
to
be
sucked
into
the
destruction
wall
at
some
lower
level
but
very
gradually
and
jerkily
our
upward
movement
as
shown
on
the
indicators
began
to
increase
and
after
an
hour
of
desperate
struggle
we
were
free
of
the
maelstrom
and
into
the
rarefied
upper
levels
the
terror
beneath
us
was
now
invisible
through
several
layers
of
cloud
formations
gibbons
brought
the
ship
back
to
an
even
keel
and
drove
her
eastward
into
one
of
the
most
brilliantly
gorgeous
sunrises
i
have
ever
seen
we
described
a
great
circle
to
the
south
and
west
in
a
long
easy
dive
for
he
had
cut
out
his
rocket
motors
to
save
them
as
much
as
possible
we
had
drawn
terrifically
on
their
fuel
reserves
in
our
battle
with
the
elements
for
the
moment
the
atmosphere
below
cleared
and
we
could
see
the
jersey
coast
far
beneath
like
a
great
map
we
not
through
yet
remarked
gibbons
suddenly
pointing
at
his
periscope
and
adjusting
it
to
telescopic
focus
a
han
ship
and
a
ship
at
that
and
he
seen
us
if
he
whips
that
beam
of
his
on
us
we
done
i
gazed
fascinated
at
the
viewplate
what
i
saw
was
a
ship
not
dissimilar
to
our
own
in
design
and
from
the
proportional
size
of
its
ports
of
about
the
same
size
as
our
swoopers
we
learned
later
that
they
carried
crews
for
the
most
part
of
not
more
than
three
or
four
men
they
had
streamline
hulls
and
tails
that
embodied
double
rudders
in
operation
they
rose
to
great
heights
on
their
powerful
repellor
rays
then
gathered
speed
either
by
a
straight
nose
dive
or
an
inclined
dive
in
which
they
sometimes
used
the
repellor
ray
slanted
at
a
sharp
angle
he
was
already
above
us
though
several
miles
to
the
north
he
could
of
course
try
to
get
on
our
tail
and
spear
us
with
his
beam
as
he
dropped
at
us
from
a
great
height
suddenly
his
beam
blazed
forth
in
a
blinding
flash
whipping
downward
slowly
to
our
right
he
went
through
a
peculiar
evolution
evidently
maneuvering
to
bring
his
beam
to
bear
on
us
with
a
spiral
motion
gibbons
instantly
sent
our
ship
into
a
series
of
evolutions
that
must
have
looked
like
those
of
a
frightened
hen
alternately
he
used
the
forward
and
the
reverse
rocket
blasts
and
in
varying
degree
we
fluttered
we
shot
suddenly
to
right
and
left
and
dropped
like
a
plummet
in
uncertain
movements
but
all
the
time
the
han
scout
dropped
toward
us
determinedly
whipping
the
air
around
us
with
his
beam
once
it
sliced
across
beneath
us
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
and
we
dropped
with
a
jar
into
the
pocket
formed
by
the
destruction
of
the
air
he
had
dropped
to
within
a
mile
of
us
and
was
coming
with
the
speed
of
a
projectile
when
the
end
came
gibbons
always
swore
it
was
sheer
luck
maybe
it
was
but
i
like
pilots
who
are
lucky
that
way
in
the
midst
of
a
dizzy
fluttering
maneuver
of
our
own
with
the
han
ship
enlarging
to
our
gaze
with
terrifying
rapidity
and
its
beam
slowly
slicing
toward
us
in
what
looked
like
certain
destruction
within
the
second
i
saw
gibbons
fingers
flick
at
the
lever
of
his
rocket
gun
and
a
split
second
later
the
han
ship
flew
apart
like
a
clay
pigeon
we
staggered
and
fluttered
crazily
for
several
moments
while
gibbons
struggled
to
bring
our
ship
into
balance
and
a
section
of
about
four
square
feet
in
the
side
of
the
ship
near
the
stern
slowly
crumbled
like
rusted
metal
his
beam
actually
had
touched
us
but
our
explosive
rocket
had
got
him
a
thousandth
of
a
second
sooner
part
of
our
rudder
had
been
annihilated
and
our
motor
damaged
but
we
were
able
to
swoop
gently
back
across
jersey
fortunately
crossing
the
ship
lanes
without
sighting
any
more
han
craft
and
finally
settling
to
rest
in
the
little
glade
beneath
the
trees
near
hart
camp
chapter
xi
the
new
boss
we
had
ultrophoned
our
arrival
and
the
big
boss
himself
surrounded
by
the
council
was
on
hand
to
welcome
us
and
learn
our
news
in
turn
we
were
informed
that
during
the
night
a
band
of
raiding
bad
bloods
disguised
under
the
insignia
of
the
altoonas
a
gang
some
distance
to
the
west
of
us
had
destroyed
several
of
our
camps
before
our
people
had
rallied
and
driven
them
off
their
purpose
evidently
had
been
to
embroil
us
with
the
altoonas
but
fortunately
one
of
our
exchanges
recognized
the
bad
blood
leader
who
had
been
slain
the
big
boss
had
mobilized
the
full
raiding
force
of
the
gang
and
was
on
the
point
of
heading
an
expedition
for
the
extermination
of
the
bad
bloods
i
looked
around
the
grim
circle
of
the
and
realized
the
fate
of
america
at
this
moment
lay
in
their
hands
their
temper
demanded
the
immediate
expenditure
of
our
full
effort
in
revenging
ourselves
for
this
raid
but
the
strategic
exigencies
to
my
mind
quite
clearly
demanded
the
instant
and
absolute
extermination
of
the
sinsings
it
might
be
only
a
matter
of
hours
for
all
we
knew
before
these
degraded
people
would
barter
clues
to
the
american
ultronic
secrets
to
the
hans
how
large
a
force
have
we
i
asked
hart
every
man
and
maid
who
can
be
spared
he
replied
that
gives
us
seven
hundred
married
and
unmarried
men
and
three
hundred
girls
more
than
the
entire
bad
blood
gang
every
one
is
equipped
with
belts
ultrophones
rocket
guns
and
swords
and
all
fighting
mad
i
meditated
how
i
might
put
the
matter
to
these
determined
men
and
was
vaguely
conscious
that
they
were
awaiting
my
words
finally
i
began
to
speak
i
do
not
remember
to
this
day
just
what
i
said
i
talked
calmly
with
due
regard
for
their
passion
but
with
deep
conviction
i
went
over
the
information
we
had
collected
point
by
point
building
my
case
logically
and
painting
a
lurid
picture
of
the
danger
impending
in
that
between
the
sinsings
and
the
hans
of
i
became
impassioned
culminating
i
believe
with
a
vow
to
proceed
against
the
hereditary
enemies
of
our
race
if
the
wyomings
were
blindly
set
on
placing
a
gang
feud
ahead
of
honor
and
duty
and
the
hopes
of
all
america
as
i
concluded
a
great
calm
came
over
me
as
of
one
detached
i
had
felt
much
the
same
way
during
several
crises
in
the
first
world
war
i
gazed
from
face
to
face
striving
to
read
their
expressions
and
in
a
mood
to
make
good
my
threat
without
any
further
heroics
if
the
decision
was
against
me
but
it
was
hart
who
sensed
the
temper
of
the
council
more
quickly
than
i
did
and
looked
beyond
it
into
the
future
he
arose
from
the
tree
trunk
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
that
settles
it
he
said
looking
around
the
ring
i
have
felt
this
thing
coming
on
for
some
time
now
i
sure
the
council
agrees
with
me
that
there
is
among
us
a
man
more
capable
than
i
to
boss
the
wyoming
gang
despite
his
handicap
of
having
had
all
too
short
a
time
in
which
to
familiarize
himself
with
our
modern
ways
and
facilities
whatever
i
can
do
to
support
his
effective
leadership
at
any
cost
i
pledge
myself
to
do
as
he
concluded
he
advanced
to
where
i
stood
and
taking
from
his
head
the
helmet
that
constituted
his
badge
of
office
to
my
surprise
he
placed
it
in
my
mechanically
extended
hand
the
roar
of
approval
that
went
up
from
the
council
members
left
me
dazed
somebody
ultrophoned
the
news
to
the
rest
of
the
gang
and
even
though
the
earflaps
of
my
helmet
were
turned
up
i
could
hear
the
cheers
with
which
my
invisible
followers
greeted
me
from
near
and
distant
hillsides
camps
and
plants
my
first
move
was
to
make
sure
that
the
phone
boss
in
communicating
this
news
to
the
members
of
the
gang
had
not
my
talk
nor
mentioned
my
plan
of
shifting
the
attack
from
the
bad
bloods
to
the
sinsings
i
was
relieved
by
his
assurance
that
he
had
not
for
it
would
have
wrecked
the
whole
plan
everything
depended
upon
our
ability
to
surprise
the
sinsings
so
i
pledged
the
council
and
my
companions
to
secrecy
and
allowed
it
to
be
believed
that
we
were
about
to
take
to
the
air
and
the
trees
against
the
bad
bloods
that
outfit
must
have
been
badly
scared
the
way
they
were
burning
the
ether
with
ultrophone
alibis
and
propaganda
for
the
benefit
of
the
more
distant
gangs
it
was
their
old
game
and
the
only
method
by
which
they
had
avoided
extermination
long
ago
from
their
immediate
neighbors
these
appeals
to
the
spirit
of
american
brotherhood
addressed
to
gangs
too
far
away
to
have
had
the
sort
of
experience
with
them
that
had
fallen
to
our
lot
i
chuckled
here
was
another
good
reason
for
the
shift
in
my
plans
were
we
actually
to
undertake
the
exterminations
of
the
bad
bloods
at
once
it
would
have
been
a
hard
job
to
convince
some
of
the
gangs
that
we
had
not
been
precipitate
and
unjustified
jealousies
and
prejudices
existed
there
were
gangs
which
would
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
bad
bloods
rather
than
to
ourselves
and
the
issue
was
now
hopelessly
beclouded
with
the
clever
lies
that
were
being
broadcast
in
an
unceasing
stream
but
the
extermination
of
the
sinsings
would
be
another
thing
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
no
warning
of
our
action
until
it
was
all
over
i
hoped
in
the
second
place
we
would
have
indisputable
proof
in
the
form
of
their
ships
and
other
paraphernalia
of
their
traffic
with
the
hans
and
the
state
of
american
prejudice
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
held
trafficking
with
the
hans
a
far
more
heinous
thing
than
even
a
vicious
gang
feud
i
called
an
executive
session
of
the
council
at
once
i
wanted
to
inventory
our
military
resources
i
created
a
new
office
on
the
spot
that
of
control
boss
and
appointed
ned
garlin
to
the
post
turning
over
his
former
responsibility
as
plants
boss
to
his
assistant
i
needed
someone
i
felt
to
tie
in
the
records
of
the
various
functional
activities
of
the
campaign
and
take
over
from
me
the
task
of
keeping
the
records
of
them
up
to
the
minute
i
received
reports
from
the
bosses
of
the
ultrophone
unit
and
those
of
food
transportation
fighting
gear
chemistry
electronic
activity
and
electrophone
intelligence
ultroscopes
air
patrol
and
contact
guard
my
ideas
for
the
campaign
of
course
were
somewhat
tinged
with
my
century
experience
and
i
found
myself
faced
with
the
task
of
working
out
a
staff
organization
that
was
a
composite
of
the
best
and
most
easily
applied
principles
of
business
and
military
efficiency
as
i
knew
them
from
the
viewpoint
of
immediate
practicality
what
i
wanted
was
an
organization
that
would
be
specialized
functionally
not
as
that
indicated
above
but
from
the
angles
of
intelligence
as
to
the
sinsings
activities
intelligence
as
to
han
activities
perfection
of
communication
with
my
own
units
of
field
command
and
perfect
mobilization
of
emergency
supplies
and
resources
it
took
several
hours
of
hard
work
with
the
council
to
map
out
the
plan
first
we
assigned
functional
experts
and
equipment
to
each
division
in
accordance
with
its
needs
then
these
in
turn
were
reassigned
by
the
new
division
bosses
to
the
field
commands
as
needed
or
as
independent
or
headquarters
units
the
two
intelligence
divisions
were
named
the
white
and
the
yellow
indicating
that
one
specialized
on
the
american
enemy
and
the
other
on
the
mongolians
the
division
in
charge
of
our
own
communications
the
assignment
of
ultrophone
frequencies
and
strengths
and
the
maintenance
of
operators
and
equipment
i
called
communications
i
named
bill
hearn
to
the
post
of
field
boss
in
charge
of
the
main
or
undetached
fighting
units
and
to
the
resources
division
i
assigned
all
responsibility
for
what
few
aircraft
we
had
and
all
transportation
and
supply
problems
i
assigned
to
resources
the
functional
bosses
stayed
with
this
division
we
finally
completed
our
organization
with
the
assignment
of
liaison
representatives
among
the
various
divisions
as
needed
thus
i
had
a
headquarters
staff
composed
of
the
division
bosses
who
reported
directly
to
ned
garlin
as
control
boss
or
to
wilma
as
my
personal
assistant
and
each
of
the
division
bosses
had
a
small
staff
of
his
own
in
the
final
summing
up
of
our
personnel
and
resources
i
found
we
had
roughly
a
thousand
troops
of
whom
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
were
in
what
i
called
the
service
divisions
the
rest
being
in
bill
field
division
this
latter
number
however
was
cut
down
somewhat
by
the
assignment
of
numerous
small
units
to
detached
service
altogether
the
actual
available
fighting
force
i
figured
would
number
about
five
hundred
by
the
time
we
actually
went
into
action
we
had
only
six
small
swoopers
but
i
had
an
ingenious
plan
in
my
mind
as
the
result
of
our
little
raid
on
that
would
make
this
sufficient
since
the
reserves
of
inertron
blocks
were
larger
than
i
expected
to
find
them
the
resources
division
by
packing
its
supply
cases
a
bit
tight
or
by
slipping
in
extra
blocks
of
inertron
was
able
to
reduce
each
to
a
weight
of
a
few
ounces
these
easily
could
be
floated
and
towed
by
the
swoopers
in
any
quantity
hitched
to
ultron
lines
it
would
be
a
virtual
impossibility
for
them
to
break
loose
the
entire
personnel
of
course
was
supplied
with
jumpers
and
if
each
man
and
girl
was
careful
to
adjust
balances
properly
the
entire
number
could
also
be
towed
along
through
the
air
grasping
wires
of
ultron
swinging
below
the
swoopers
or
stringing
out
behind
them
there
would
be
nothing
tiring
about
this
because
the
strain
would
be
no
greater
than
that
of
carrying
a
one
or
two
pound
weight
in
the
hand
except
for
air
friction
at
high
speeds
but
to
make
doubly
sure
that
we
should
lose
none
of
our
personnel
i
gave
strict
orders
that
the
belts
and
tow
lines
should
be
equipped
with
rings
and
hooks
so
great
was
the
efficiency
of
the
fundamental
organization
and
discipline
of
the
gang
that
we
got
under
way
at
nightfall
one
by
one
the
swoopers
eased
into
the
air
each
followed
by
its
long
train
or
of
humanity
and
supply
cases
hanging
lightly
from
its
tow
line
for
convenience
the
tow
lines
were
made
of
an
alloy
of
ultron
which
unlike
the
metal
itself
is
visible
at
first
these
tails
hung
downward
but
as
the
ships
swung
into
formation
and
headed
eastward
toward
the
bad
blood
territory
gathering
speed
they
began
to
string
out
behind
and
swinging
low
from
each
ship
on
heavily
weighted
lines
ultroscope
ultrophone
and
observers
keenly
scanned
the
countryside
while
intelligence
men
in
the
swoopers
above
bent
over
their
instrument
boards
and
viewplates
leaving
control
boss
ned
garlin
temporarily
in
charge
of
affairs
wilma
and
i
dropped
a
weighted
line
from
our
ship
and
slid
down
about
half
way
to
the
under
lookouts
that
is
to
say
about
a
thousand
feet
the
sensation
of
floating
swiftly
through
the
air
like
this
in
the
absolute
security
of
one
confidence
in
the
inertron
belt
was
one
of
delight
to
me
we
reascended
into
the
swooper
as
the
expedition
approached
the
territory
of
the
bad
bloods
and
directed
the
preparations
for
the
bombardment
it
was
part
of
my
plan
to
appear
to
carry
out
the
attack
as
originally
planned
about
fifteen
miles
from
their
camps
our
ships
came
to
a
halt
and
maintained
their
positions
for
a
while
with
the
idling
blasts
of
their
rocket
motors
to
give
the
ultroscope
operators
a
chance
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
territory
below
us
for
it
was
very
important
that
this
next
step
in
our
program
should
be
carried
out
with
all
secrecy
at
length
they
reported
the
ground
below
us
entirely
clear
of
any
appearance
of
human
occupation
and
a
gun
unit
of
specialists
was
lowered
with
a
dozen
rocket
guns
equipped
with
special
automatic
devices
that
the
resources
division
had
developed
at
my
request
a
few
hours
before
our
departure
these
were
aiming
and
timing
devices
after
calculating
the
range
elevation
and
rocket
charges
carefully
the
guns
were
left
concealed
in
a
ravine
and
the
men
were
hauled
up
into
the
ship
again
at
the
predetermined
hour
those
unmanned
rocket
guns
would
begin
automatically
to
bombard
the
bad
bloods
hillsides
shifting
their
aim
and
elevation
slightly
with
each
shot
as
did
many
of
our
artillery
pieces
in
the
first
world
war
in
the
meantime
we
turned
south
about
twenty
miles
and
grounded
waiting
for
the
bombardment
to
begin
before
we
attempted
to
sneak
across
the
han
ship
lane
i
was
relying
for
security
on
the
distraction
that
the
bombardment
might
furnish
the
han
observers
it
was
tense
work
waiting
but
the
affair
went
through
as
planned
our
squadron
drifting
across
the
route
high
enough
to
enable
the
tails
of
troops
and
supply
cases
to
clear
the
ground
in
crossing
the
second
ship
route
out
along
the
beaches
of
jersey
we
were
not
so
successful
in
escaping
observation
a
han
ship
came
speeding
along
at
a
very
low
elevation
we
caught
it
on
our
electronic
location
and
direction
finders
and
also
located
it
with
our
ultroscopes
but
it
came
so
fast
and
so
low
that
i
thought
it
best
to
remain
where
we
had
grounded
the
second
time
and
lie
quiet
rather
than
get
under
way
and
cross
in
front
of
it
the
point
was
this
while
the
hans
had
no
such
devices
as
our
ultroscopes
with
which
we
could
see
in
the
dark
within
certain
limitations
of
course
and
their
electronic
instruments
would
be
virtually
useless
in
uncovering
our
presence
since
all
but
natural
electronic
activities
were
carefully
eliminated
from
our
apparatus
except
electrophone
receivers
which
are
not
easily
spotted
the
hans
did
have
some
very
highly
sensitive
sound
devices
which
operated
with
great
efficiency
in
calm
weather
so
far
as
sounds
emanating
from
the
air
were
concerned
but
the
ground
roar
greatly
confused
their
use
of
these
instruments
in
the
location
of
specific
sounds
floating
up
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
this
ship
must
have
caught
some
slight
noise
of
ours
however
in
its
sensitive
instruments
for
we
heard
its
electronic
devices
go
into
play
and
picked
up
the
routine
report
of
the
noise
to
its
base
ship
commander
but
from
the
nature
of
the
conversation
i
judged
they
had
not
identified
it
and
were
in
fact
more
curious
about
the
detonations
they
were
picking
up
now
from
the
bad
blood
lands
some
sixty
miles
or
so
to
the
west
immediately
after
this
ship
had
shot
by
we
took
the
air
again
and
following
much
the
same
route
that
i
had
taken
the
previous
night
climbed
in
a
long
out
over
the
ocean
swung
toward
the
north
and
finally
the
west
we
set
our
course
however
for
the
sinsings
land
north
of
instead
of
for
the
city
itself
chapter
xii
the
finger
of
doom
as
we
crossed
the
hudson
river
a
few
miles
north
of
the
city
we
dropped
several
units
of
the
yellow
intelligence
division
with
full
instrumental
equipment
their
apparatus
cases
were
nicely
balanced
at
only
a
few
ounces
weight
each
and
the
men
used
their
chute
capes
to
ease
their
drops
we
recrossed
the
river
a
little
distance
above
and
began
dropping
white
intelligence
units
and
a
few
long
and
short
range
gun
units
then
we
held
our
position
until
we
began
to
get
reports
gradually
we
ringed
the
territory
of
the
sinsings
our
observation
units
working
busily
and
patiently
at
their
locators
and
scopes
both
aloft
and
aground
until
garlin
finally
turned
to
me
with
the
remark
the
map
circle
is
complete
now
boss
we
got
clear
locations
all
the
way
around
them
let
me
see
it
i
replied
and
studied
the
illuminated
viewplate
map
with
its
little
overlapping
circles
of
light
that
indicated
spots
proved
clear
of
the
enemy
by
ultroscopic
observation
i
nodded
to
bill
hearn
go
ahead
now
hearn
i
said
and
place
your
barrage
men
he
spoke
into
his
ultrophone
and
three
of
the
ships
began
to
glide
in
a
wide
ring
around
the
enemy
territory
every
few
seconds
at
the
word
from
his
unit
boss
a
gunner
would
drop
off
the
wire
and
slipping
the
clasp
of
his
chute
cape
drift
down
into
the
darkness
below
bill
formed
two
lines
parallel
to
and
facing
the
river
and
enclosing
the
entire
territory
of
the
enemy
between
them
above
and
below
straddling
the
river
were
two
defensive
lines
these
latter
were
merely
to
hold
their
positions
the
others
were
to
close
in
toward
each
other
pushing
a
barrage
five
miles
ahead
of
them
when
the
two
barrages
met
both
lines
were
to
switch
to
barrage
and
continue
to
close
in
on
any
of
the
enemy
who
might
have
drifted
through
the
previous
curtain
of
fire
in
the
meantime
bill
kept
his
reserves
a
picked
corps
of
a
hundred
men
the
same
that
had
accompanied
hart
and
myself
in
our
fight
with
the
han
squadron
in
the
air
divided
about
equally
among
the
of
four
ships
a
final
roll
call
by
units
companies
divisions
and
functions
established
the
fact
that
all
our
forces
were
in
position
no
han
activity
was
reported
and
no
han
broadcasts
indicated
any
suspicion
of
our
expedition
nor
was
there
any
indication
that
the
sinsings
had
any
knowledge
of
the
fate
in
store
for
them
the
idling
of
generators
was
reported
from
the
center
of
their
camp
obviously
those
of
the
ships
the
hans
had
given
them
the
price
of
their
treason
to
their
race
again
i
gave
the
word
and
hearn
passed
on
the
order
to
his
subordinates
far
below
us
and
several
miles
to
the
right
and
left
the
two
barrage
lines
made
their
appearance
from
the
great
height
to
which
we
had
risen
they
appeared
like
lines
of
brilliant
winking
lights
and
the
detonations
were
muffled
by
the
distances
into
a
sort
of
rumbling
distant
thunder
hearn
and
his
assistants
were
very
busy
measuring
calculating
and
snapping
out
ultrophone
orders
to
unit
commanders
that
resulted
in
the
straightening
of
lines
and
the
closing
of
gaps
in
the
barrage
the
white
division
boss
reported
the
utmost
confusion
in
the
sinsing
organization
they
were
as
might
be
expected
an
inefficient
loosely
disciplined
gang
and
repeated
broadcasts
for
help
to
neighboring
gangs
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
mongolians
had
not
used
explosives
for
many
generations
they
nevertheless
jumped
at
the
conclusion
that
they
were
being
raided
by
the
hans
their
frantic
broadcasts
persisted
in
this
thought
despite
the
nervous
electrophonic
inquiries
of
the
hans
themselves
to
whom
the
sound
of
the
battle
was
evidently
audible
and
who
were
trying
to
locate
the
trouble
at
this
point
the
swooper
i
had
sent
south
toward
the
city
went
into
action
as
a
diversion
to
keep
the
hans
at
home
its
loaded
with
gunners
using
the
most
highly
explosive
rockets
we
had
hung
invisible
in
the
darkness
of
the
sky
and
bombarded
the
city
from
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
with
an
entire
city
to
shoot
at
and
the
object
of
creating
as
much
commotion
therein
as
possible
regardless
of
actual
damage
the
gunners
had
no
difficulty
in
hitting
the
mark
i
could
see
the
glow
of
the
city
and
the
stabbing
flashes
of
exploding
rockets
in
the
end
the
hans
uncertain
as
to
what
was
going
on
fell
back
on
a
defensive
policy
and
shot
their
hell
cylinder
or
wall
of
upturned
disintegrator
rays
into
operation
that
of
course
ended
our
bombardment
of
them
the
rays
were
a
perfect
defense
disintegrating
our
rockets
as
they
were
reached
if
they
had
not
sent
out
ships
before
turning
on
the
rays
and
if
they
had
none
within
sufficient
radius
already
in
the
air
all
would
be
well
i
queried
garlin
on
this
but
he
assured
me
yellow
intelligence
reported
no
indications
of
han
ships
nearer
than
miles
this
would
probably
give
us
a
free
hand
for
a
while
since
most
of
their
instruments
recorded
only
imperfectly
or
not
at
all
through
the
death
wall
requisitioning
one
of
the
viewplates
of
the
headquarters
ship
and
the
services
of
an
expert
operator
i
instructed
him
to
focus
on
our
lines
below
i
wanted
a
of
the
men
in
action
he
began
to
manipulate
his
controls
and
chaotic
shadows
moved
rapidly
across
the
plate
fading
in
and
out
of
focus
until
he
reached
an
adjustment
that
gave
me
a
picture
of
the
forest
floor
apparently
feet
wide
with
the
intervening
branches
and
foliage
of
the
trees
appearing
like
shadows
that
melted
into
reality
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
i
watched
one
man
setting
up
his
with
skillful
speed
his
lips
pursed
slightly
as
though
he
were
whistling
as
he
adjusted
the
tall
tripod
on
which
the
long
tube
was
balanced
swiftly
he
twirled
the
knobs
controlling
the
aim
and
elevation
of
his
piece
then
lifting
a
belt
of
ammunition
from
the
big
box
which
itself
looked
heavy
enough
to
break
down
the
spindly
tripod
he
inserted
the
end
of
it
in
the
lock
of
his
tube
and
touched
the
proper
combination
of
buttons
then
he
stepped
aside
and
occupied
himself
with
peering
carefully
through
the
trees
ahead
not
even
a
tremor
shook
the
tube
but
i
knew
that
at
intervals
of
something
less
than
a
second
it
was
discharging
small
projectiles
which
traveling
under
their
own
continuously
reduced
power
were
arching
into
the
air
to
fall
precisely
five
miles
ahead
and
explode
with
the
force
of
shells
such
as
we
used
in
the
first
world
war
another
gunner
fifty
feet
to
the
right
of
him
waved
a
hand
and
called
out
something
to
him
then
picking
up
his
own
tube
and
tripod
he
gauged
the
distance
between
the
trees
ahead
of
him
and
the
height
of
their
lowest
branches
and
bending
forward
a
bit
flexed
his
muscles
and
leaped
lightly
some
feet
another
leap
took
him
another
twenty
feet
or
so
where
he
began
to
set
up
his
piece
i
ordered
my
observer
then
to
switch
to
the
barrage
itself
he
got
a
close
focus
on
it
but
this
showed
little
except
a
continuous
series
of
blinding
flashes
which
from
the
viewplate
lit
up
the
entire
interior
of
the
ship
an
focus
proved
better
i
had
thought
that
some
of
our
french
and
american
artillery
of
the
century
had
achieved
the
ultimate
in
mathematical
precision
of
fire
but
i
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
the
accuracy
of
that
line
of
terrific
explosions
as
it
moved
steadily
forward
mowing
down
trees
as
a
scythe
cuts
grass
or
used
to
years
ago
literally
churning
up
the
earth
and
the
splintered
blasted
remains
of
the
forest
giants
to
a
depth
of
from
ten
to
twenty
feet
by
now
the
two
curtains
of
fire
were
nearing
each
other
lines
of
vibrant
shimmering
continuous
brilliant
destruction
inevitably
squeezing
the
sinsings
between
them
even
as
i
watched
a
group
of
them
who
had
been
making
a
futile
effort
to
get
their
three
machines
into
the
air
abandoned
their
efforts
and
rushed
forth
into
the
milling
mob
i
queried
the
control
boss
sharply
on
the
futility
of
this
attempt
of
theirs
and
learned
that
the
hans
apparently
in
doubt
as
to
what
was
going
on
had
continued
to
play
safe
and
broken
off
their
power
broadcast
after
ordering
all
their
own
ships
east
of
the
alleghenies
to
the
ground
for
fear
these
ships
they
had
traded
to
the
sinsings
might
be
used
against
them
again
i
turned
to
my
viewplate
which
was
still
focussed
on
the
central
section
of
the
sinsing
works
the
confusion
of
the
traitors
was
entirely
that
of
fear
for
our
barrage
had
not
yet
reached
them
some
of
them
set
up
their
and
fired
at
random
over
the
barrage
line
then
gave
it
up
they
realized
that
they
had
no
target
to
shoot
at
no
way
of
knowing
whether
our
gunners
were
a
few
hundred
feet
or
several
miles
beyond
it
their
ultrophone
men
of
whom
they
did
not
have
many
stood
around
in
tense
attitudes
their
helmet
phones
strapped
around
their
ears
nervously
fingering
the
tuning
controls
at
their
belts
unquestionably
they
must
have
located
some
of
our
frequencies
and
overheard
many
of
our
reports
and
orders
but
they
were
confused
and
disorganized
if
they
had
an
ultrophone
boss
they
evidently
were
not
reporting
to
him
in
an
organized
way
they
were
beginning
to
draw
back
now
before
our
advancing
fire
with
intermittent
desperation
they
began
to
shoot
over
our
barrage
again
and
the
explosions
of
their
rockets
flashed
at
widely
scattered
points
beyond
a
few
took
distance
pot
shots
oddly
enough
it
was
our
own
forces
that
suffered
the
first
casualties
in
the
battle
some
of
these
distance
shots
by
chance
registered
hits
while
our
men
were
under
strict
orders
not
to
exceed
their
barrage
distances
seen
upon
the
ultroscope
viewplate
the
battle
looked
as
though
it
were
being
fought
in
daylight
perhaps
on
a
cloudy
day
while
the
explosions
of
the
rockets
appeared
as
flashes
of
extra
brilliance
the
two
barrage
lines
were
not
more
than
five
hundred
feet
apart
when
the
sinsings
resorted
to
tactics
we
had
not
foreseen
we
noticed
first
that
they
began
to
lighten
themselves
by
throwing
away
extra
equipment
a
few
of
them
in
their
excitement
threw
away
too
much
and
shot
suddenly
into
the
air
then
a
scattering
few
floated
up
gently
followed
by
increasing
numbers
while
still
others
preserving
a
weight
balance
jumped
toward
the
closing
barrages
and
leaped
high
hoping
to
clear
them
some
succeeded
we
saw
others
blown
about
like
leaves
in
a
windstorm
to
crumple
and
drift
slowly
down
or
else
to
fall
into
the
barrage
their
belts
blown
from
their
bodies
however
it
was
not
part
of
our
plan
to
allow
a
single
one
of
them
to
escape
and
find
his
way
to
the
hans
i
quickly
passed
the
word
to
bill
hearn
to
have
the
alternate
men
in
his
line
raise
their
barrages
and
heard
him
bark
out
a
mathematical
formula
to
the
unit
bosses
we
backed
off
our
ships
as
the
explosions
climbed
into
the
air
in
stagger
formation
until
they
reached
a
height
of
three
miles
i
believe
any
of
the
sinsings
who
tried
to
float
away
to
freedom
succeeded
but
we
did
know
later
that
a
few
who
leaped
the
barrage
got
away
and
ultimately
reached
it
was
those
who
managed
to
jump
the
barrage
who
gave
us
the
most
trouble
with
half
of
our
turned
aloft
i
foresaw
we
would
not
have
enough
to
establish
successive
ground
barrages
and
so
ordered
the
barrage
back
two
miles
from
which
positions
our
curtains
began
to
close
in
again
this
time
however
gauged
to
explode
not
on
contact
but
thirty
feet
in
the
air
this
left
little
chance
for
the
sinsings
to
leap
either
over
or
under
it
gradually
the
two
barrages
approached
each
other
until
they
finally
met
and
in
the
grey
dawn
the
battle
ended
our
own
casualties
amounted
to
men
in
the
ground
forces
eighteen
of
whom
had
been
slain
in
hand
to
hand
fighting
with
the
few
of
the
enemy
who
managed
to
reach
our
lines
and
in
the
crew
and
force
of
swooper
no
which
had
been
located
by
one
of
the
enemy
ultroscopes
and
brought
down
with
fire
since
nearly
every
member
of
the
sinsing
gang
had
so
far
as
we
knew
been
killed
we
considered
the
raid
a
great
success
it
had
however
a
far
greater
significance
than
this
to
all
of
us
who
took
part
in
the
expedition
the
effectiveness
of
our
barrage
tactics
definitely
established
a
confidence
in
our
ability
to
overcome
the
hans
as
i
pointed
out
to
wilma
it
has
been
my
belief
all
along
dear
that
the
american
explosive
rocket
is
a
far
more
efficient
weapon
than
the
disintegrator
ray
of
the
hans
once
we
can
train
all
our
gangs
to
use
it
systematically
and
in
fashion
as
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
single
individual
shooting
at
a
mark
in
direct
line
of
vision
the
is
inferior
in
destructive
power
to
the
dis
ray
except
as
its
range
may
be
a
little
greater
the
trouble
is
that
to
date
it
has
been
used
only
as
we
used
our
rifles
and
shot
guns
in
the
century
the
possibilities
of
its
use
as
artillery
in
laying
barrages
that
advance
along
the
ground
or
climb
into
the
air
are
tremendous
the
dis
ray
inevitably
reveals
its
source
of
emanation
the
rocket
gun
does
not
the
dis
ray
can
reach
its
target
only
in
a
straight
line
the
rocket
may
be
made
to
travel
in
an
arc
over
intervening
obstacles
to
an
unseen
target
nor
must
we
forget
that
our
ultronists
now
are
promising
us
a
perfect
shield
against
the
dis
ray
in
inertron
i
tremble
though
tony
dear
when
i
think
of
the
horrors
that
are
ahead
of
us
the
hans
are
clever
they
will
develop
defenses
against
our
new
tactics
and
they
are
sure
to
mass
against
us
not
only
the
full
force
of
their
power
in
america
but
the
united
forces
of
the
world
empire
they
are
a
cowardly
race
in
one
sense
but
clever
as
the
very
devils
in
hell
and
inheritors
of
a
calm
ruthless
vicious
persistency
nevertheless
i
prophesied
the
finger
of
doom
points
squarely
at
them
today
and
unless
you
and
i
are
killed
in
the
struggle
we
shall
live
to
see
america
blast
the
yellow
blight
from
the
face
of
the
