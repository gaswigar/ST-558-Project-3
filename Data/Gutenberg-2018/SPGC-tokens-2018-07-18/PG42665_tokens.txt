satan
diary
leonid
andreyev
last
work
was
completed
by
the
great
russian
a
few
days
before
he
died
in
finland
in
september
but
a
few
years
ago
the
most
popular
and
successful
of
russian
writers
andreyev
died
almost
penniless
a
sad
tragic
figure
disillusioned
over
the
tragedy
of
russia
a
year
ago
leonid
andreyev
wrote
me
that
he
was
eager
to
come
to
america
to
study
this
country
and
familiarize
americans
with
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
countrymen
i
arranged
for
his
visit
to
this
country
and
informed
him
of
this
by
cable
but
on
the
very
day
i
sent
my
cable
the
sad
news
came
from
finland
announcing
that
leonid
andreyev
died
of
heart
failure
in
satan
diary
andreyev
summed
up
his
boundless
disillusionment
in
an
absorbing
satire
on
human
life
fearlessly
and
mercilessly
he
hurled
the
falsehoods
and
hypocrisies
into
the
face
of
life
he
portrayed
satan
coming
to
this
earth
to
amuse
himself
and
play
having
assumed
the
form
of
an
american
satan
set
out
on
a
tour
through
europe
in
quest
of
amusement
and
adventure
before
him
passed
various
forms
of
spurious
virtues
hypocrisies
the
ruthless
cruelty
of
man
and
the
often
deceptive
innocence
of
woman
within
a
short
time
satan
finds
himself
outwitted
deceived
relieved
of
his
millions
mocked
humiliated
beaten
by
man
in
his
own
devilish
devices
the
story
of
andreyev
beginning
as
a
writer
is
best
told
in
his
autobiography
which
he
gave
me
in
i
was
born
he
said
in
oryol
in
and
studied
there
at
the
gymnasium
i
studied
poorly
while
in
the
seventh
class
i
was
for
a
whole
year
known
as
the
worst
student
and
my
mark
for
conduct
was
never
higher
than
sometimes
the
most
pleasant
time
i
spent
at
school
which
i
recall
to
this
day
with
pleasure
was
recess
time
between
lessons
and
also
the
rare
occasions
when
i
was
sent
out
from
the
classroom
the
sunbeams
the
free
sunbeams
which
penetrated
some
cleft
and
which
played
with
the
dust
in
the
hallway
all
this
was
so
mysterious
so
interesting
so
full
of
a
peculiar
hidden
meaning
when
i
studied
at
the
gymnasium
my
father
an
engineer
died
as
a
university
student
i
was
in
dire
need
during
my
first
course
in
petersburg
i
even
starved
not
so
much
out
of
real
necessity
as
because
of
my
youth
inexperience
and
my
inability
to
utilize
the
unnecessary
parts
of
my
costume
i
am
to
this
day
ashamed
to
think
that
i
went
two
days
without
food
at
a
time
when
i
had
two
or
three
pairs
of
trousers
and
two
overcoats
which
i
could
have
sold
it
was
then
that
i
wrote
my
first
story
about
a
starving
student
i
cried
when
i
wrote
it
and
the
editor
who
returned
my
manuscript
laughed
that
story
of
mine
remained
unpublished
in
in
january
i
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
kill
myself
by
shooting
as
a
result
of
this
unsuccessful
attempt
i
was
forced
by
the
authorities
into
religious
penitence
and
i
contracted
heart
trouble
though
not
of
a
serious
nature
yet
very
annoying
during
this
time
i
made
one
or
two
unsuccessful
attempts
at
writing
i
devoted
myself
with
greater
pleasure
and
success
to
painting
which
i
loved
from
childhood
on
i
made
portraits
to
order
at
and
rubles
a
piece
in
i
received
my
diploma
and
became
an
assistant
attorney
but
i
was
at
the
very
outset
sidetracked
i
was
offered
a
position
on
for
which
i
was
to
report
court
proceedings
i
did
not
succeed
in
getting
any
practice
as
a
lawyer
i
had
only
one
case
and
lost
it
at
every
point
in
i
wrote
my
first
story
for
the
easter
number
and
since
that
time
i
have
devoted
myself
exclusively
to
literature
maxim
gorky
helped
me
considerably
in
my
literary
work
by
his
always
practical
advice
and
suggestions
andreyev
first
steps
in
literature
his
first
short
stories
attracted
but
little
attention
at
the
time
of
their
appearance
it
was
only
when
countess
tolstoy
the
wife
of
leo
tolstoy
in
a
letter
to
the
came
out
in
defense
of
artistic
purity
and
moral
power
in
contemporary
literature
declaring
that
russian
society
instead
of
buying
reading
and
making
famous
the
works
of
the
andreyevs
should
rise
against
such
filth
with
indignation
that
almost
everybody
who
knew
how
to
read
in
russia
turned
to
the
little
volume
of
the
young
writer
in
her
attack
upon
andreyev
countess
tolstoy
said
as
follows
the
poor
new
writers
like
andreyev
succeeded
only
in
concentrating
their
attention
on
the
filthy
point
of
human
degradation
and
uttered
a
cry
to
the
undeveloped
reading
public
inviting
them
to
see
and
to
examine
the
decomposed
corpse
of
human
degradation
and
to
close
their
eyes
to
god
wonderful
vast
world
with
the
beauties
of
nature
with
the
majesty
of
art
with
the
lofty
yearnings
of
the
human
soul
with
the
religious
and
moral
struggles
and
the
great
ideals
of
goodness
even
with
the
downfall
misfortunes
and
weaknesses
of
such
people
as
dostoyevsky
depicted
in
describing
all
these
every
true
artist
should
illumine
clearly
before
humanity
not
the
side
of
filth
and
vice
but
should
struggle
against
them
by
illumining
the
highest
ideals
of
good
truth
and
the
triumph
over
evil
weakness
and
the
vices
of
mankind
i
should
like
to
cry
out
loudly
to
the
whole
world
in
order
to
help
those
unfortunate
people
whose
wings
given
to
each
of
them
for
high
flights
toward
the
understanding
of
the
spiritual
light
beauty
kindness
and
god
are
clipped
by
these
andreyevs
this
letter
of
countess
tolstoy
called
forth
a
storm
of
protest
in
the
russian
press
and
strange
to
say
the
representatives
of
the
fair
sex
were
among
the
warmest
defenders
of
the
young
author
answering
the
attack
many
women
in
their
letters
to
the
press
pointed
out
that
the
author
of
anna
karenina
had
been
abused
in
almost
the
same
manner
for
his
kreutzer
sonata
and
that
tolstoy
himself
had
been
accused
of
exerting
just
such
an
influence
as
the
countess
attributed
to
andreyev
over
the
youth
of
russia
since
the
publication
of
countess
tolstoy
condemnation
andreyev
has
produced
a
series
of
masterpieces
such
as
the
life
of
father
vassily
a
powerful
psychological
study
red
laughter
a
war
story
written
with
the
blood
of
russia
the
life
of
man
a
striking
morality
presentation
in
five
acts
anathema
his
greatest
drama
and
the
seven
who
were
hanged
in
which
the
horrors
of
russian
life
under
the
tsar
were
delineated
with
such
beautiful
simplicity
and
power
that
turgenev
or
tolstoy
himself
would
have
signed
his
name
to
this
masterpiece
thus
the
first
accusations
against
andreyev
were
disarmed
by
his
artistic
productions
permeated
with
sincere
profound
love
for
all
that
is
pure
in
life
dostoyevsky
and
maupassant
depicted
more
subjects
such
as
that
treated
in
the
abyss
than
andreyev
but
with
them
these
stories
are
lost
in
the
great
mass
of
their
other
works
while
in
andreyev
who
at
that
time
had
as
yet
produced
but
a
few
short
stories
works
like
the
abyss
stood
out
in
bold
relief
i
recall
my
first
meeting
with
leonid
andreyev
in
two
weeks
after
my
visit
to
count
leo
tolstoy
at
yasnaya
polyana
at
that
time
he
had
already
become
the
most
popular
russian
writer
his
popularity
having
overshadowed
even
that
of
maxim
gorky
as
i
drove
from
terioki
to
andreyev
house
along
the
road
the
stern
and
taciturn
little
finnish
driver
suddenly
broke
the
silence
by
saying
to
me
in
broken
russian
andreyev
is
a
good
writer
although
he
is
a
russian
he
is
a
very
good
man
he
is
building
a
beautiful
house
here
in
finland
and
he
gives
employment
to
many
of
our
people
we
were
soon
at
the
gate
of
andreyev
beautiful
villa
a
fantastic
structure
original
in
design
something
like
the
conception
of
the
architect
in
the
life
of
man
my
son
is
out
rowing
with
his
wife
in
the
gulf
of
finland
andreyev
mother
told
me
they
will
be
back
in
half
an
hour
as
i
waited
i
watched
the
seething
activity
everywhere
on
estate
in
yasnaya
polyana
the
home
of
count
tolstoy
everything
seemed
long
established
fixed
serenely
beautiful
andreyev
estate
was
astir
with
vigorous
life
young
strong
men
were
building
the
house
of
man
more
than
thirty
of
them
were
working
on
the
roof
and
in
the
yard
and
a
little
distance
away
in
the
meadows
young
women
and
girls
and
red
faced
were
haying
youth
strength
vigor
everywhere
and
above
all
the
ringing
laughter
of
little
children
at
play
i
could
see
from
the
window
the
black
little
river
which
sparkled
in
the
sun
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
constant
noise
of
the
workmen
axes
and
hammers
was
so
loud
that
i
did
not
notice
when
leonid
andreyev
entered
the
room
where
i
was
waiting
for
him
pardon
my
manner
of
dressing
he
said
as
we
shook
hands
in
the
summer
i
lead
a
lazy
life
and
do
not
write
a
line
i
am
afraid
i
am
forgetting
even
to
sign
my
name
i
had
seen
numerous
photographs
of
leonid
andreyev
but
he
did
not
look
like
any
of
them
instead
of
a
young
man
there
stood
before
me
a
strong
handsome
man
with
wonderful
eyes
he
wore
a
grayish
blouse
black
wide
pantaloons
up
to
his
knees
and
no
shoes
or
stockings
we
soon
spoke
of
russian
literature
at
the
time
particularly
of
the
drama
we
have
no
real
drama
in
russia
said
andreyev
russia
has
not
yet
produced
anything
that
could
justly
be
called
a
great
drama
perhaps
storm
by
ostrovsky
is
the
only
russian
play
that
may
be
classed
as
a
drama
tolstoy
plays
can
not
be
placed
in
this
category
of
the
later
writers
anton
chekhov
came
nearest
to
giving
real
dramas
to
russia
but
unfortunately
he
was
taken
from
us
in
the
prime
of
his
life
what
do
you
consider
your
own
of
man
and
the
stars
i
asked
they
are
not
dramas
they
are
merely
presentations
in
so
many
acts
answered
andreyev
and
after
some
hesitation
added
i
have
not
written
any
dramas
but
it
is
possible
that
i
will
write
one
at
this
point
andreyev
wife
came
in
dressed
in
a
russian
blouse
the
conversation
turned
to
america
and
to
the
treatment
accorded
to
maxim
gorky
in
new
york
when
i
was
a
child
i
loved
america
remarked
andreyev
perhaps
cooper
and
mayne
reid
my
favorite
authors
in
my
childhood
days
were
responsible
for
this
i
was
always
planning
to
run
away
to
america
i
am
anxious
even
now
to
visit
america
but
i
am
afraid
i
may
get
as
bad
a
reception
as
my
friend
gorky
got
he
laughed
as
he
glanced
at
his
wife
after
a
brief
pause
he
said
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
the
gorky
incident
is
that
while
in
his
stories
and
articles
about
america
gorky
wrote
nothing
but
the
very
worst
that
could
be
said
about
that
country
he
never
told
me
anything
but
the
very
best
about
america
some
day
he
will
probably
describe
his
impressions
of
america
as
he
related
them
to
me
it
was
a
very
warm
day
the
sun
was
burning
mercilessly
in
the
large
room
mme
andreyev
suggested
that
it
would
be
more
pleasant
to
go
down
to
a
shady
place
near
the
black
little
river
on
the
way
down
the
hill
andreyev
inquired
about
tolstoy
health
and
was
eager
to
know
his
views
on
contemporary
matters
if
tolstoy
were
young
now
he
would
have
been
with
us
he
said
we
stepped
into
a
boat
mme
andreyev
took
up
the
oars
and
began
to
row
we
resumed
our
conversation
the
decadent
movement
in
russian
literature
said
andreyev
started
to
make
itself
felt
about
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
at
first
it
was
looked
upon
as
mere
child
play
as
a
curiosity
now
it
is
regarded
more
seriously
although
i
do
not
belong
to
that
school
i
do
not
consider
it
worthless
the
fault
with
it
is
that
it
has
but
few
talented
people
in
its
ranks
and
these
few
direct
the
criticism
of
the
decadent
school
they
are
the
writers
and
also
the
critics
and
they
praise
whatever
they
write
of
the
younger
men
alexander
blok
is
perhaps
the
most
gifted
but
in
russia
our
clothes
change
quickly
nowadays
and
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
the
future
will
tell
us
in
our
literature
and
our
life
how
do
i
picture
to
myself
this
future
continued
andreyev
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
i
can
not
know
even
the
fate
and
future
of
my
own
child
how
can
i
foretell
the
future
of
such
a
great
country
as
russia
but
i
believe
that
the
russian
people
have
a
great
future
before
them
in
life
and
in
literature
for
they
are
a
great
people
rich
in
talents
kind
and
savage
as
yet
it
is
true
very
ignorant
but
on
the
whole
they
do
not
differ
so
much
from
other
european
nations
suddenly
the
author
of
red
laughter
looked
upon
me
intently
and
asked
how
is
it
that
the
european
and
the
american
press
has
ceased
to
interest
itself
in
our
struggle
for
emancipation
is
it
possible
that
the
reaction
in
russia
appeals
to
them
more
than
our
people
yearnings
for
freedom
simply
because
the
reaction
happens
to
be
stronger
at
the
present
time
in
that
event
they
are
probably
sympathizing
with
the
shah
of
persia
russia
is
a
lunatic
asylum
the
people
who
are
hanged
are
not
the
people
who
should
be
hanged
everywhere
else
honest
people
are
at
large
and
only
criminals
are
in
prison
in
russia
the
honest
people
are
in
prison
and
the
criminals
are
at
large
the
russian
government
is
composed
of
a
band
of
criminals
and
nicholas
ii
is
not
the
greatest
of
them
there
are
still
greater
ones
i
do
not
hold
that
the
russian
government
alone
is
guilty
of
these
horrors
the
european
nations
and
the
americans
are
just
as
much
to
blame
for
they
look
on
in
silence
while
the
most
despicable
crimes
are
committed
the
murderer
usually
has
at
least
courage
while
he
who
looks
on
silently
when
murder
is
committed
is
a
contemptible
weakling
england
and
france
who
have
become
so
friendly
to
our
government
are
surely
watching
with
compassion
the
poor
shah
who
hangs
the
constitutional
leaders
perhaps
i
do
not
know
international
law
perhaps
i
am
not
speaking
as
a
practical
man
one
nation
must
not
interfere
with
the
internal
affairs
of
another
nation
but
why
do
they
interfere
with
our
movement
for
freedom
france
helped
the
russian
government
in
its
war
against
the
people
by
giving
money
to
russia
germany
also
helped
secretly
in
countries
each
individual
must
behave
decently
when
a
man
murders
robs
dishonors
women
he
is
thrown
into
prison
but
when
the
russian
government
is
murdering
helpless
men
and
women
and
children
the
other
governments
look
on
indifferently
and
yet
they
speak
of
god
if
this
had
happened
in
the
middle
ages
a
crusade
would
have
been
started
by
civilized
peoples
who
would
have
marched
to
russia
to
free
the
women
and
the
children
from
the
claws
of
the
government
andreyev
became
silent
his
wife
kept
rowing
for
some
time
slowly
without
saying
a
word
we
soon
reached
the
shore
and
returned
silently
to
the
house
that
was
twelve
years
ago
i
met
him
several
times
after
that
the
last
time
i
visited
him
in
petrograd
during
the
july
riots
in
a
literary
friend
thus
describes
the
funeral
of
leonid
andreyev
which
gives
a
picture
of
the
tragedy
of
russia
in
the
morning
a
decision
had
to
be
reached
as
to
the
day
of
the
funeral
it
was
necessary
to
see
to
the
purchase
and
the
delivery
of
the
coffin
from
viborg
and
to
undertake
all
those
unavoidable
hard
duties
which
are
so
painful
to
the
family
it
appeared
that
the
russian
exiles
living
in
our
village
had
no
permits
from
the
finnish
government
to
go
to
viborg
nor
the
money
for
that
expense
it
further
appeared
that
the
family
of
leonid
andreyev
had
left
at
their
disposal
only
one
hundred
marks
about
dollars
which
the
doctor
who
had
come
from
the
station
after
andreyev
death
declined
to
take
from
the
widow
for
his
visit
this
was
all
the
family
possessed
it
was
necessary
to
charge
a
russian
exile
living
in
a
neighboring
village
who
had
a
pass
for
viborg
with
the
sad
commission
of
finding
among
some
wealthy
people
in
viborg
who
had
known
andreyev
the
means
required
for
the
funeral
on
the
following
day
mass
was
read
floral
tributes
and
wreaths
from
viborg
with
black
inscriptions
made
hastily
in
ink
on
white
ribbons
began
to
arrive
they
were
all
from
private
individuals
the
local
refugees
brought
garlands
of
autumn
foliage
bouquets
of
late
flowers
their
children
laid
their
carefully
woven
simple
and
touching
little
childish
wreaths
at
the
foot
of
the
coffin
leonid
andreyev
widow
did
not
wish
to
inter
the
body
in
foreign
soil
and
it
was
decided
temporarily
until
burial
in
native
ground
to
leave
his
body
in
the
little
mortuary
in
the
park
on
the
estate
of
a
local
woman
landowner
the
day
of
the
funeral
was
not
widely
known
the
need
for
special
permits
to
travel
deprived
many
of
the
opportunity
to
attend
in
this
way
it
happened
that
only
a
very
small
group
of
people
followed
the
body
from
the
house
to
the
mortuary
none
of
his
close
friends
was
there
they
like
his
brothers
sister
one
of
his
sons
were
in
russia
neighbors
refugees
acquaintances
of
the
last
two
years
with
whom
his
exile
had
accidentally
thrown
him
into
contact
people
who
had
no
connection
with
russian
literature
almost
all
alien
in
spirit
such
was
the
little
group
of
russians
that
followed
the
coffin
of
leonid
andreyev
to
its
temporary
resting
place
it
was
a
tragic
funeral
this
funeral
in
exile
of
a
writer
who
is
so
dearly
loved
by
the
whole
intellectual
class
of
russia
whom
the
younger
generation
of
russia
acclaimed
with
such
enthusiasm
meanwhile
he
rests
in
a
foreign
land
waiting
waiting
for
free
russia
to
demand
back
his
ashes
and
pay
tribute
to
his
genius
among
his
last
notes
breathing
deep
anguish
and
despair
found
on
his
desk
were
the
following
lines
revolution
is
just
as
unsatisfactory
a
means
of
settling
disputes
as
is
war
if
it
be
impossible
to
vanquish
a
hostile
idea
except
by
smashing
the
skull
in
which
it
is
contained
if
it
be
impossible
to
appease
a
hostile
heart
except
by
piercing
it
with
a
bayonet
then
of
course
fight
leonid
andreyev
died
of
a
broken
heart
but
the
spirit
of
his
genius
is
deathless

diary
january
on
board
the
this
is
exactly
the
tenth
day
since
i
have
become
human
and
am
leading
this
earthly
life
my
loneliness
is
very
great
i
am
not
in
need
of
friends
but
i
must
speak
of
myself
and
i
have
no
one
to
speak
to
thoughts
alone
are
not
sufficient
and
they
will
not
become
quite
clear
precise
and
exact
until
i
express
them
in
words
it
is
necessary
to
arrange
them
in
a
row
like
soldiers
or
telephone
poles
to
lay
them
out
like
a
railway
track
to
throw
across
bridges
and
viaducts
to
construct
barrows
and
enclosures
to
indicate
stations
in
certain
places
and
only
then
will
everything
become
clear
this
laborious
engineering
work
i
think
they
call
logic
and
consistency
and
is
essential
to
those
who
desire
to
be
wise
it
is
not
essential
to
all
others
they
may
wander
about
as
they
please
the
work
is
slow
difficult
and
repulsive
for
one
who
is
accustomed
to
i
do
not
know
what
to
call
it
to
embracing
all
in
one
breath
and
expressing
all
in
a
single
breath
it
is
not
in
vain
that
men
respect
their
thinkers
so
much
and
it
is
not
in
vain
that
these
unfortunate
thinkers
if
they
are
honest
and
conscientious
in
this
process
of
construction
as
ordinary
engineers
end
in
insane
asylums
i
am
but
a
few
days
on
this
earth
and
more
than
once
have
the
yellow
walls
of
the
insane
asylum
and
its
luring
open
door
flashed
before
my
eyes
yes
it
is
extremely
difficult
and
irritates
one
nerves
i
have
just
now
wasted
so
much
of
the
ship
fine
stationery
to
express
a
little
ordinary
thought
on
the
inadequacy
of
man
words
and
logic
what
will
it
be
necessary
to
waste
to
give
expression
to
the
great
and
the
unusual
i
want
to
warn
you
my
earthly
reader
at
the
very
outset
not
to
gape
in
astonishment
the
can
not
be
in
the
language
of
your
grumbling
if
you
do
not
believe
me
go
to
the
nearest
insane
asylum
and
listen
to
the
inmates
they
have
all
realized
and
wanted
to
give
expression
to
it
and
now
you
can
hear
the
roar
and
rumble
of
these
wrecked
engines
their
wheels
revolving
and
hissing
in
the
air
and
you
can
see
with
what
difficulty
they
manage
to
hold
intact
the
rapidly
dissolving
features
of
their
astonished
faces
i
see
you
are
all
ready
to
ply
me
with
questions
now
that
you
learned
that
i
am
satan
in
human
form
it
is
so
fascinating
whence
did
i
come
what
are
the
ways
of
hell
is
there
immortality
there
and
also
what
is
the
price
of
coal
at
the
stock
exchange
of
hell
unfortunately
my
dear
reader
despite
my
desire
to
the
contrary
if
i
had
such
a
desire
i
am
powerless
to
satisfy
your
very
proper
curiosity
i
could
have
composed
for
your
benefit
one
of
those
funny
little
stories
about
horny
and
hairy
devils
which
appeal
so
much
to
your
meagre
imagination
but
you
have
had
enough
of
them
already
and
i
do
not
want
to
lie
so
rudely
and
ungracefully
i
will
lie
to
you
elsewhere
when
you
least
expect
it
and
that
will
be
far
more
interesting
for
both
of
us
and
the
truth
how
am
i
to
tell
it
when
even
my
name
can
not
be
expressed
in
your
tongue
you
have
called
me
satan
and
i
accept
the
name
just
as
i
would
have
accepted
any
other
be
it
so
i
am
satan
but
my
real
name
sounds
quite
different
quite
different
it
has
an
extraordinary
sound
and
try
as
i
may
i
can
not
force
it
into
your
narrow
ear
without
tearing
it
open
together
with
your
brain
be
it
so
i
am
satan
and
nothing
more
and
you
yourself
are
to
blame
for
this
my
friend
why
is
there
so
little
understanding
in
your
reason
your
reason
is
like
a
sack
containing
only
crusts
of
stale
bread
while
it
is
necessary
to
have
something
more
than
bread
you
have
but
two
conceptions
of
existence
life
and
death
how
then
can
i
reveal
to
you
the
all
your
existence
is
an
absurdity
only
because
you
do
not
have
this
and
where
can
i
get
it
for
you
i
am
human
even
as
you
in
my
skull
is
your
brain
in
my
mouth
are
your
cubic
words
jostling
one
another
about
with
their
sharp
corners
and
i
can
not
tell
you
of
the
extraordinary
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
there
are
no
devils
i
would
lie
but
if
i
say
that
such
creatures
do
exist
i
also
deceive
you
you
see
how
difficult
it
is
how
absurd
my
friend
i
can
also
tell
you
but
little
that
you
would
understand
of
how
i
assumed
the
human
form
with
which
i
began
my
earthly
life
ten
days
ago
first
of
all
forget
about
your
favorite
hairy
horny
winged
devils
who
breathe
fire
transform
fragments
of
earthenware
into
gold
and
change
old
men
into
fascinating
youths
and
having
done
all
this
and
prattled
much
nonsense
they
disappear
suddenly
through
a
wall
remember
when
want
to
visit
your
earth
must
always
become
human
why
this
is
so
you
will
learn
after
your
death
meanwhile
remember
i
am
a
human
being
now
like
yourself
there
is
not
the
foul
smell
of
a
goat
about
me
but
the
fragrance
of
perfume
and
you
need
not
fear
to
shake
my
hand
lest
i
may
scratch
you
with
my
nails
i
manicure
them
just
as
you
do
but
how
did
it
all
happen
very
simply
when
i
first
conceived
the
desire
to
visit
this
earth
i
selected
as
the
most
satisfactory
lodging
a
american
billionaire
henry
wondergood
i
killed
him
at
night
of
course
not
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
but
you
can
not
bring
me
to
court
despite
this
confession
because
the
american
is
alive
and
we
both
greet
you
with
one
respectful
bow
i
and
wondergood
he
simply
rented
his
empty
place
to
me
you
understand
and
not
all
of
it
either
the
devil
take
him
and
to
my
great
regret
i
can
only
through
the
same
door
which
leads
you
too
to
liberty
through
death
this
is
the
most
important
thing
you
may
understand
something
of
what
i
may
have
to
say
later
on
although
to
speak
to
you
of
such
matters
in
your
language
is
like
trying
to
conceal
a
mountain
in
a
vest
pocket
or
to
empty
niagara
with
a
thimble
imagine
for
example
that
you
my
dear
king
of
nature
should
want
to
come
closer
to
the
ants
and
that
by
some
miracle
you
became
a
real
little
ant
then
you
may
have
some
conception
of
that
gulf
which
separates
me
now
from
what
i
was
no
still
more
imagine
that
you
were
a
sound
and
have
become
a
mere
symbol
a
musical
mark
on
paper
no
still
worse
no
comparisons
can
make
clear
to
you
that
terrible
gulf
whose
bottom
even
i
do
not
see
as
yet
or
perhaps
there
is
no
bottom
there
at
all
think
of
it
for
two
days
after
leaving
new
york
i
suffered
from
seasickness
this
sounds
queer
to
you
who
are
accustomed
to
wallow
in
your
own
dirt
well
i
i
have
also
wallowed
in
it
but
it
was
not
queer
at
all
i
only
smiled
once
in
thinking
that
was
not
i
but
wondergood
and
said
roll
on
wondergood
roll
on
there
is
another
question
to
which
you
probably
want
an
answer
why
did
i
come
to
this
earth
and
accept
such
an
unprofitable
exchange
to
be
transformed
from
satan
the
mighty
immortal
chieftain
and
ruler
into
you
i
am
tired
of
seeking
words
that
can
not
be
found
i
will
answer
you
in
english
french
italian
or
german
languages
we
both
understand
well
i
have
grown
lonesome
in
hell
and
i
have
come
upon
the
earth
to
lie
and
play
you
know
what
ennui
is
and
as
for
falsehood
you
know
it
well
too
and
as
for
you
can
judge
it
to
a
certain
extent
by
your
own
theaters
and
celebrated
actors
perhaps
you
yourself
are
playing
a
little
rôle
in
parliament
at
home
or
in
your
church
if
you
are
you
may
understand
something
of
the
of
play
and
if
in
addition
you
are
familiar
with
the
multiplication
table
then
multiply
the
delight
and
joy
of
play
into
any
considerable
figure
and
you
will
get
an
idea
of
my
enjoyment
of
my
play
no
imagine
that
you
are
an
ocean
wave
which
plays
eternally
and
lives
only
in
play
take
this
wave
for
example
which
i
see
outside
the
porthole
now
and
which
wants
to
lift
our
atlantic
but
here
i
am
again
seeking
words
and
comparisons
i
simply
want
to
play
at
present
i
am
still
an
unknown
actor
a
modest
débutante
but
i
hope
to
become
no
less
a
celebrity
than
your
own
garrick
or
aldrich
after
i
have
played
what
i
please
i
am
proud
selfish
and
even
if
you
please
vain
and
boastful
you
know
what
vanity
is
when
you
crave
the
praise
and
plaudits
even
of
a
fool
then
i
entertain
the
brazen
idea
that
i
am
a
genius
satan
is
known
for
his
brazenness
and
so
imagine
that
i
have
grown
weary
of
hell
where
all
these
hairy
and
horny
rogues
play
and
lie
no
worse
than
i
do
and
that
i
am
no
longer
satisfied
with
the
laurels
of
hell
in
which
i
but
perceive
no
small
measure
of
base
flattery
and
downright
stupidity
but
i
have
heard
of
you
my
earthly
friend
i
have
heard
that
you
are
wise
tolerably
honest
properly
incredulous
responsive
to
the
problems
of
eternal
art
and
that
you
yourself
play
and
lie
so
badly
that
you
might
appreciate
the
playing
of
others
not
in
vain
have
you
so
many
and
so
i
have
come
you
understand
my
stage
is
the
earth
and
the
nearest
scene
for
which
i
am
now
bound
is
rome
the
eternal
city
as
it
is
called
here
in
your
profound
conception
of
eternity
and
other
simple
matters
i
have
not
yet
selected
my
company
would
you
not
like
to
join
it
but
i
believe
that
and
to
whom
i
am
now
subservient
like
all
your
earthly
things
will
realize
my
unselfish
motives
and
will
send
me
worthy
partners
old
europe
is
so
rich
in
talents
i
believe
that
i
shall
find
a
keen
and
appreciative
audience
in
europe
too
i
confess
that
i
first
thought
of
going
to
the
east
which
some
of
my
compatriots
made
their
scene
of
activity
some
time
ago
with
no
small
measure
of
success
but
the
east
is
too
credulous
and
is
inclined
too
much
to
poison
and
the
ballet
its
gods
are
ludicrous
the
east
still
reeks
too
much
of
hairy
animals
its
lights
and
shadows
are
barbarously
crude
and
too
bright
to
make
it
worth
while
for
a
refined
artist
as
i
am
to
go
into
that
crowded
foul
circus
tent
ah
my
friend
i
am
so
vain
that
i
even
begin
this
diary
not
without
the
secret
intention
of
impressing
you
with
my
modesty
in
the
rôle
of
of
words
and
comparisons
i
hope
you
will
not
take
advantage
of
my
frankness
and
cease
believing
me
are
there
any
other
questions
of
the
play
itself
i
have
no
clear
idea
yet
it
will
be
composed
by
the
same
impresario
who
will
assemble
the
actors
my
modest
rôle
as
a
beginning
will
be
that
of
a
man
who
so
loves
his
fellow
beings
that
he
is
willing
to
give
them
everything
his
soul
and
his
money
of
course
you
have
not
forgotten
that
i
am
a
billionaire
i
have
three
billion
dollars
sufficient
is
it
not
for
one
spectacular
performance
one
more
detail
before
i
conclude
this
page
i
have
with
me
sharing
my
fate
a
certain
irwin
toppi
my
secretary
a
most
worthy
person
in
his
black
frock
coat
and
silk
top
hat
his
long
nose
resembling
an
unripened
pear
and
his
smoothly
shaven
face
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
a
prayer
book
in
his
pocket
my
toppi
came
upon
this
earth
from
from
hell
and
by
the
same
means
as
mine
he
too
assumed
the
human
form
and
it
seems
quite
successfully
the
rogue
is
entirely
immune
from
seasickness
however
to
be
seasick
one
must
have
some
brains
and
my
toppi
is
unusually
stupid
even
for
this
earth
besides
he
is
impolite
and
ventures
to
offer
advice
i
am
rather
sorry
that
out
of
our
entire
wealth
of
material
i
did
not
select
some
one
better
but
i
was
impressed
by
his
honesty
and
partial
familiarity
with
the
earth
it
seemed
more
pleasant
to
enter
upon
this
little
jaunt
with
an
experienced
comrade
quite
a
long
time
ago
he
once
before
assumed
the
human
form
and
was
so
taken
by
religious
sentiments
that
think
of
it
he
entered
a
franciscan
monastery
lived
there
to
a
ripe
old
age
and
died
peacefully
under
the
name
of
brother
vincent
his
ashes
became
the
object
of
veneration
for
believers
not
a
bad
career
for
a
fool
of
a
devil
no
sooner
did
he
enter
upon
this
trip
with
me
than
he
began
to
sniff
about
for
incense
an
incurable
habit
you
will
probably
like
him
and
now
enough
get
thee
hence
my
friend
i
wish
to
be
alone
your
shallow
reflection
upon
this
wall
wears
upon
me
i
wish
to
be
alone
or
only
with
this
wondergood
who
has
leased
his
abode
to
me
and
seems
to
have
gotten
the
best
of
me
somehow
or
other
the
sea
is
calm
i
am
no
longer
nauseated
but
i
am
afraid
of
something
i
am
afraid
i
fear
this
darkness
which
they
call
night
and
descends
upon
the
ocean
here
in
the
cabin
there
is
still
some
light
but
there
on
deck
there
is
terrible
darkness
and
my
eyes
are
quite
helpless
these
silly
reflectors
they
are
worthless
they
are
able
to
reflect
things
by
day
but
in
the
darkness
they
lose
even
this
miserable
power
of
course
i
shall
get
used
to
the
darkness
i
have
already
grown
used
to
many
things
but
just
now
i
am
ill
at
ease
and
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
the
mere
turn
of
a
key
obsesses
me
with
this
blind
ever
present
darkness
whence
does
it
come
and
how
brave
men
are
with
their
dim
reflectors
they
see
nothing
and
simply
say
it
is
dark
here
we
must
make
a
light
then
they
themselves
put
it
out
and
go
to
sleep
i
regard
these
braves
with
a
kind
of
cold
wonder
and
i
am
seized
with
admiration
or
must
one
possess
a
great
mind
to
appreciate
horror
like
mine
you
are
not
such
a
coward
wondergood
you
always
bore
the
reputation
of
being
a
hardened
man
and
a
man
of
experience
there
is
one
moment
in
the
process
of
my
assumption
of
the
human
form
that
i
can
not
recollect
without
horror
that
was
when
for
the
first
time
i
heard
the
beating
of
my
heart
this
regular
loud
sound
which
speaks
as
much
of
death
as
of
life
filled
me
with
the
hitherto
inexperienced
sensation
of
horror
men
are
always
quarrelling
about
accounts
but
how
can
they
carry
in
their
breasts
counting
machine
registering
with
the
speed
of
a
magician
the
fleeting
seconds
of
life
at
first
i
wanted
to
shout
and
to
run
back
before
i
could
grow
accustomed
to
life
but
here
i
looked
at
toppi
this
fool
was
calmly
brushing
his
top
hat
with
the
sleeve
of
his
frock
coat
i
broke
out
into
laughter
and
cried
toppi
the
brush
we
both
brushed
ourselves
while
the
counting
machine
in
my
breast
was
computing
the
seconds
and
it
seemed
to
me
adding
on
a
few
for
good
measure
finally
hearing
its
brazen
beating
i
thought
i
might
not
have
time
enough
to
finish
my
toillette
i
have
been
in
a
great
hurry
for
some
time
just
what
it
was
i
would
not
be
able
to
complete
i
did
not
know
but
for
two
days
i
was
in
a
mad
rush
to
eat
and
drink
and
even
sleep
the
counting
machine
was
beating
away
while
i
lay
in
slumber
but
i
never
rush
now
i
know
that
i
will
manage
to
get
through
and
my
moments
seem
inexhaustible
but
the
little
machine
keeps
on
beating
just
the
same
like
a
drunken
soldier
at
a
drum
and
how
about
the
very
moments
it
is
using
up
now
are
they
to
be
counted
as
equal
to
the
great
ones
then
i
say
it
is
all
a
fraud
and
i
protest
as
a
honest
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
as
a
merchant
i
do
not
feel
well
yet
i
would
not
repulse
even
a
friend
at
this
moment
ah
in
all
the
universe
i
am
alone
february
rome
hotel
internationale
i
am
driven
mad
whenever
i
am
compelled
to
seize
the
club
of
a
policeman
to
bring
order
in
my
brain
facts
to
the
right
thoughts
to
the
left
moods
to
the
rear
clear
the
road
for
his
highness
conscience
which
barely
moves
about
upon
its
stilts
i
am
compelled
to
do
this
otherwise
there
would
be
a
riot
an
abrecadebra
chaos
and
so
i
call
you
to
order
gentleman
facts
and
i
begin
night
darkness
the
air
is
balmy
there
is
a
pleasant
fragrance
toppi
is
enchanted
we
are
in
italy
our
speeding
train
is
approaching
rome
we
are
enjoying
our
soft
couches
when
suddenly
crash
everything
flies
to
the
devil
the
train
has
gone
out
of
its
mind
it
is
wrecked
i
confess
without
shame
that
i
am
not
very
brave
that
i
was
seized
with
terror
and
seemed
to
have
lost
consciousness
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
with
much
labor
i
crawled
out
of
the
corner
into
which
i
had
been
hurled
i
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
exit
there
were
only
walls
and
corners
i
felt
something
stinging
and
beating
at
me
and
all
about
nothing
but
darkness
suddenly
i
felt
a
body
beneath
my
feet
i
stepped
right
upon
the
face
only
afterwards
did
i
discover
that
the
body
was
that
of
george
my
lackey
killed
outright
i
shouted
and
my
obliging
toppi
came
to
my
aid
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
to
an
open
window
as
both
exits
had
been
barricaded
by
fragments
of
the
car
and
baggage
i
leaped
out
but
toppi
lingered
behind
my
knees
were
trembling
i
was
groaning
but
still
he
failed
to
appear
i
shouted
suddenly
he
reappeared
at
the
window
and
shouted
back
what
are
you
crying
about
i
am
looking
for
our
hats
and
your
portfolio
a
few
moments
later
he
returned
and
handed
me
my
hat
he
himself
had
his
silk
top
hat
on
and
carried
the
portfolio
i
shook
with
laughter
and
said
young
man
you
have
forgotten
the
umbrella
but
the
old
buffoon
has
no
sense
of
humor
he
replied
seriously
i
do
not
carry
an
umbrella
and
do
you
know
our
george
is
dead
and
so
is
the
chef
so
this
fallen
carcass
which
has
no
feelings
and
upon
whose
face
one
steps
with
impunity
is
our
george
i
was
again
seized
with
terror
and
suddenly
my
ears
were
pierced
with
groans
wild
shrieks
whistlings
and
cries
all
the
sounds
wherewith
these
braves
wail
when
they
are
crushed
at
first
i
was
deafened
i
heard
nothing
the
cars
caught
fire
the
flames
and
smoke
shot
up
into
the
air
the
wounded
began
to
groan
and
without
waiting
for
the
flesh
to
roast
i
darted
like
a
flash
into
the
field
what
a
leap
fortunately
the
low
hills
of
the
roman
campagna
are
very
convenient
for
this
kind
of
sport
and
i
was
no
means
behind
in
the
line
of
runners
when
out
of
breath
i
hurled
myself
upon
the
ground
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
hear
or
see
anything
only
toppi
was
approaching
but
what
a
terrible
thing
this
heart
is
my
face
touched
the
earth
the
earth
was
cool
firm
calm
and
here
i
liked
it
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
restored
my
breath
and
put
my
heart
back
into
its
place
i
felt
easier
the
stars
above
were
calm
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
get
excited
about
they
were
not
concerned
with
things
below
they
merely
shine
in
triumph
that
is
their
eternal
ball
and
at
this
brilliant
ball
the
earth
clothed
in
darkness
appeared
as
an
enchanting
stranger
in
a
black
mask
not
at
all
badly
expressed
i
trust
that
you
my
reader
will
be
pleased
my
style
and
my
manners
are
improving
i
kissed
toppi
in
the
darkness
i
always
kiss
those
i
like
in
the
darkness
and
i
said
you
are
carrying
your
human
form
toppi
very
well
i
respect
you
but
what
are
we
to
do
now
those
lights
yonder
in
the
sky
they
are
the
lights
of
rome
but
they
are
too
far
away
yes
it
is
rome
affirmed
toppi
and
raised
his
hand
do
you
hear
whistling
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
the
piercing
shrieking
of
locomotives
they
were
sounding
the
alarm
yes
they
are
whistling
i
said
and
laughed
they
are
whistling
repeated
toppi
smiling
he
never
laughs
but
here
again
i
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
i
was
cold
lonely
quivering
in
my
feet
there
was
still
the
sensation
of
treading
upon
corpses
i
wanted
to
shake
myself
like
a
dog
after
a
bath
you
must
understand
me
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
seen
and
felt
your
corpse
my
dear
reader
and
if
you
pardon
me
it
did
not
appeal
to
me
at
all
why
did
it
not
protest
when
i
walked
over
its
face
george
had
such
a
beautiful
young
face
and
he
carried
himself
with
much
dignity
remember
your
face
too
may
be
trod
upon
and
will
you
too
remain
submissive
we
did
not
proceed
to
rome
but
went
instead
in
search
of
the
nearest
night
lodging
we
walked
long
we
grew
tired
we
longed
to
drink
oh
how
we
longed
to
drink
and
now
permit
me
to
present
to
you
my
new
friend
signor
thomas
magnus
and
his
beautiful
daughter
maria
at
first
we
observed
the
faint
flicker
of
a
light
as
we
approached
nearer
we
found
a
little
house
its
white
walls
gleaming
through
a
thicket
of
dark
cypress
trees
and
shrubbery
there
was
a
light
in
one
of
the
windows
the
rest
were
barricaded
with
shutters
the
house
had
a
stone
fence
an
iron
gate
strong
doors
and
silence
at
first
glance
it
all
looked
suspicious
toppi
knocked
again
silence
i
knocked
still
silence
finally
there
came
a
gruff
voice
asking
from
behind
the
iron
door
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
hardly
mumbling
with
his
parched
tongue
my
brave
toppi
narrated
the
story
of
the
catastrophe
and
our
escape
he
spoke
at
length
and
then
came
the
click
of
a
lock
and
the
door
was
opened
following
behind
our
austere
and
silent
stranger
we
entered
the
house
passed
through
several
dark
and
silent
rooms
walked
up
a
flight
of
creaking
stairs
into
a
brightly
lighted
room
apparently
the
stranger
workroom
there
was
much
light
many
books
with
one
open
beneath
a
low
lamp
shaded
by
a
simple
green
globe
we
had
not
noticed
this
light
in
the
field
but
what
astonished
me
was
the
silence
of
the
house
despite
the
rather
early
hour
not
a
move
not
a
sound
not
a
voice
was
to
be
heard
have
a
seat
we
sat
down
and
toppi
now
almost
in
pain
began
again
to
narrate
his
story
but
the
strange
host
interrupted
him
yes
a
catastrophe
they
often
occur
on
our
roads
were
there
many
victims
toppi
continued
his
prattle
and
the
host
while
listening
to
him
took
a
revolver
out
of
his
pocket
and
hid
it
in
a
table
drawer
adding
carelessly
this
is
not
a
particularly
quiet
neighborhood
well
please
remain
here
for
the
first
time
he
raised
his
dark
eyebrows
and
his
large
dim
eyes
and
studied
us
intently
as
if
he
were
gazing
upon
something
savage
in
a
museum
it
was
an
impolite
and
brazen
stare
i
arose
and
said
i
fear
that
we
are
not
welcome
here
signor
and
he
stopped
me
with
an
impatient
and
slightly
sarcastic
gesture
nonsense
you
remain
here
i
will
get
you
some
wine
and
food
my
servant
is
here
in
the
daytime
only
so
allow
me
to
wait
on
you
you
will
find
the
bathroom
behind
this
door
go
wash
and
freshen
up
while
i
get
the
wine
make
yourself
at
home
while
we
ate
and
drank
with
savage
relish
i
confess
this
unsympathetic
gentleman
kept
on
reading
a
book
as
if
there
were
no
one
else
in
the
room
undisturbed
by
toppi
munching
and
the
struggle
with
a
bone
i
studied
my
host
carefully
almost
my
height
his
pale
face
bore
an
expression
of
weariness
he
had
a
black
oily
beard
but
his
brow
was
high
and
his
nose
betrayed
good
sense
how
would
you
describe
it
well
here
again
i
seek
comparisons
imagine
the
nose
betraying
the
story
of
a
great
passionate
extraordinary
secret
life
it
is
beautiful
and
seems
to
have
been
made
not
out
of
muscle
and
cartilage
but
out
of
what
do
you
call
it
out
of
thoughts
and
brazen
desires
he
seems
quite
brave
too
but
i
was
particularly
attracted
by
his
hands
very
big
very
white
and
giving
the
impression
of
i
do
not
know
why
his
hands
attracted
me
so
much
but
suddenly
i
thought
how
beautifully
exact
the
number
of
fingers
exactly
ten
of
them
ten
thin
evil
wise
crooked
fingers
i
said
politely
thank
you
signor
he
replied
my
name
is
magnus
thomas
magnus
have
some
wine
americans
i
waited
for
toppi
to
introduce
me
according
to
the
english
custom
and
i
looked
toward
magnus
one
had
to
be
an
ignorant
illiterate
animal
not
to
know
me
toppi
broke
in
henry
wondergood
of
illinois
his
secretary
irwin
toppi
your
obedient
servant
yes
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
old
buffoon
blurted
out
his
tirade
evincing
a
thorough
lack
of
pride
and
magnus
yes
he
was
a
little
startled
billions
my
friend
billions
he
gazed
at
me
long
and
intently
wondergood
henry
wondergood
are
you
not
sir
that
american
billionaire
who
seeks
to
bestow
upon
humanity
the
benefits
of
his
billions
i
modestly
shook
my
head
in
the
affirmative
yes
i
am
the
gentleman
toppi
shook
his
head
in
affirmation
the
ass
yes
we
are
the
gentlemen
magnus
bowed
and
said
with
a
tinge
of
irony
in
his
voice
humanity
is
awaiting
you
wondergood
judging
by
the
roman
newspapers
it
is
extremely
impatient
but
i
must
crave
your
pardon
for
this
very
modest
meal
i
did
not
know
i
seized
his
large
strangely
warm
hand
and
shaking
it
violently
in
american
fashion
i
said
nonsense
signor
magnus
i
was
a
before
i
became
a
billionaire
while
you
are
a
straightforward
honest
and
noble
gentleman
whose
hand
i
press
with
the
utmost
respect
the
devil
take
it
not
a
single
human
face
has
yet
aroused
in
me
as
much
sympathy
as
yours
magnus
said
magnus
said
nothing
i
can
not
continue
this
i
said
he
said
this
cursed
consistency
is
deadly
to
my
inspiration
it
transforms
me
into
a
silly
romanticist
of
a
boulevard
sheet
and
makes
me
lie
like
a
mediocrity
i
have
five
senses
i
am
a
complete
human
being
and
yet
i
speak
only
of
the
hearing
and
how
about
the
sight
i
assure
you
it
did
not
remain
idle
and
this
sensation
of
the
earth
of
italy
of
my
existence
which
i
now
perceive
with
a
new
and
sweet
strength
you
imagine
that
all
i
did
was
to
listen
to
wise
thomas
magnus
he
speaks
and
i
gaze
understand
answer
while
i
think
what
a
beautiful
earth
what
a
beautiful
campagna
di
roma
i
persisted
in
penetrating
the
recesses
of
the
house
into
its
locked
silent
rooms
with
every
moment
my
joy
mounted
at
the
thought
that
i
am
alive
that
i
can
speak
and
play
and
suddenly
i
rather
liked
the
idea
of
being
human
i
remember
that
i
held
out
my
card
to
magnus
henry
wondergood
he
was
surprised
but
laid
the
card
politely
on
the
table
i
felt
like
implanting
a
kiss
on
his
brow
for
this
politeness
for
the
fact
that
he
too
was
human
i
too
am
human
i
was
particularly
proud
of
my
foot
encased
in
a
fine
tan
leather
shoe
and
i
persisted
in
swinging
it
swing
on
beautiful
human
american
foot
i
was
extremely
emotional
that
evening
i
even
wanted
to
weep
to
look
my
host
straight
in
the
eyes
and
to
squeeze
out
of
my
own
eyes
so
full
of
love
and
goodness
two
little
tears
i
actually
did
it
for
at
that
moment
i
felt
a
little
pleasant
sting
in
my
nose
as
if
it
had
been
hit
by
a
spurt
of
lemonade
i
observed
that
my
two
little
tears
made
an
impression
upon
magnus
but
toppi
while
i
experienced
this
wondrous
poem
of
feeling
human
and
even
of
weeping
he
slept
like
a
dead
one
at
the
very
same
table
i
was
rather
angered
this
was
really
going
too
far
i
wanted
to
shout
at
him
but
magnus
restrained
me
he
has
had
a
good
deal
of
excitement
and
is
weary
mr
wondergood
the
hour
had
really
grown
late
we
had
been
talking
and
arguing
with
magnus
for
two
hours
when
toppi
fell
asleep
i
sent
him
off
to
bed
while
we
continued
to
talk
and
drink
for
quite
a
while
i
drank
more
wine
but
magnus
restrained
himself
there
was
a
dimness
about
his
face
i
was
beginning
to
develop
an
admiration
for
his
grim
and
at
times
evil
secretive
countenance
he
said
i
believe
in
your
altruistic
passion
wondergood
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
a
man
of
wisdom
and
of
action
and
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
cold
could
place
any
serious
hopes
upon
your
money
three
billion
dollars
that
is
a
mighty
power
magnus
yes
three
billion
dollars
a
mighty
power
indeed
he
agreed
rather
unwillingly
but
what
will
you
do
with
it
i
laughed
you
probably
want
to
say
what
can
this
ignoramus
of
an
american
this
erstwhile
who
knows
swine
better
than
he
knows
men
do
with
the
money
the
first
business
helps
the
other
said
magnus
i
dare
say
you
have
but
a
slight
opinion
of
this
foolish
philanthropist
whose
head
has
been
turned
by
his
gold
said
i
yes
to
be
sure
what
can
i
do
i
can
open
another
university
in
chicago
or
another
maternity
hospital
in
san
francisco
or
another
humanitarian
reformatory
in
new
york
the
latter
would
be
a
distinct
work
of
mercy
quoth
magnus
do
not
gaze
at
me
with
such
reproach
wondergood
i
am
not
jesting
you
will
find
in
me
the
same
pure
love
for
humanity
which
burns
so
fiercely
in
you
he
was
laughing
at
me
and
i
felt
pity
for
him
not
to
love
people
miserable
unfortunate
magnus
i
could
kiss
his
brow
with
great
pleasure
not
to
love
people
yes
i
do
not
love
them
affirmed
magnus
but
i
am
glad
that
you
do
not
intend
to
travel
the
conventional
road
of
all
american
philanthropists
your
billions
three
billions
magnus
one
could
build
a
nation
on
this
money
yes
or
destroy
a
nation
said
i
with
this
gold
magnus
one
can
start
a
war
or
a
revolution
yes
i
actually
succeeded
in
arousing
his
interest
his
large
white
hands
trembled
slightly
and
in
his
eyes
there
gleamed
for
a
moment
a
look
of
respect
you
wondergood
are
not
as
foolish
as
i
thought
he
arose
paced
up
and
down
the
room
and
halting
before
me
asked
sneeringly
and
you
know
exactly
what
your
humanity
needs
most
the
creation
of
a
new
or
the
destruction
of
the
old
state
war
or
peace
rest
or
revolution
who
are
you
wondergood
of
illinois
that
you
essay
to
solve
problems
you
had
better
keep
on
building
your
maternity
hospitals
and
universities
that
is
far
less
dangerous
work
i
liked
the
man
hauteur
i
bowed
my
head
modestly
and
said
you
are
right
signor
magnus
who
am
i
henry
wondergood
to
undertake
the
solution
of
these
problems
but
i
do
not
intend
to
solve
them
i
merely
indicate
them
i
indicate
them
and
i
seek
the
solution
i
seek
the
solution
and
the
man
who
can
give
it
to
me
i
have
never
read
a
serious
book
carefully
i
see
you
have
quite
a
supply
of
books
here
you
are
a
misanthrope
magnus
you
are
too
much
of
a
european
not
to
be
easily
disillusioned
in
things
while
we
young
america
believe
in
humanity
a
man
must
be
created
you
in
europe
are
bad
craftsmen
and
have
created
a
bad
man
we
shall
create
a
better
one
i
beg
your
pardon
for
my
frankness
as
long
as
i
was
merely
henry
wondergood
i
devoted
myself
only
to
the
creation
of
pigs
and
my
pigs
let
me
say
to
you
have
been
awarded
no
fewer
medals
and
decorations
than
field
marshal
moltke
but
now
i
desire
to
create
people
magnus
smiled
you
are
an
alchemist
wondergood
you
would
transform
lead
into
gold
yes
i
want
to
create
gold
and
i
seek
the
philosopher
stone
but
has
it
not
already
been
found
it
has
been
found
only
you
do
not
know
how
to
use
it
it
is
love
ah
magnus
i
do
not
know
yet
what
i
will
do
but
my
plans
are
heroic
and
magnificent
if
not
for
that
misanthropic
smile
of
yours
i
might
go
further
believe
in
man
magnus
and
give
me
your
aid
you
know
what
man
needs
most
he
said
coldly
and
with
sadness
he
needs
prisons
and
gallows
i
exclaimed
in
anger
i
am
particularly
adept
in
feigning
anger
you
are
slandering
me
magnus
i
see
that
you
must
have
experienced
some
very
great
misfortune
perhaps
treachery
and
hold
on
wondergood
i
never
speak
of
myself
and
do
not
like
to
hear
others
speak
of
me
let
it
be
sufficient
for
you
to
know
that
you
are
the
first
man
in
four
years
to
break
in
upon
my
solitude
and
this
only
due
to
chance
i
do
not
like
people
oh
pardon
but
i
do
not
believe
it
magnus
went
over
to
the
bookcase
and
with
an
expression
of
supreme
contempt
he
seized
the
first
volume
he
laid
his
hands
upon
and
you
who
have
read
no
books
he
said
do
you
know
what
these
books
are
about
only
about
evil
about
the
mistakes
and
sufferings
of
humanity
they
are
filled
with
tears
and
blood
wondergood
look
in
this
thin
little
book
which
i
clasp
between
two
fingers
is
contained
a
whole
ocean
of
human
blood
and
if
you
should
take
all
of
them
together
and
who
has
spilled
this
blood
the
devil
i
felt
flattered
and
wanted
to
bow
in
acknowledgment
but
he
threw
the
book
aside
and
shouted
no
sir
man
man
has
spilled
this
blood
yes
i
do
read
books
but
only
for
one
purpose
to
learn
how
to
hate
man
and
to
hold
him
in
contempt
you
wondergood
have
transformed
your
pigs
into
gold
yes
and
i
can
see
how
your
gold
is
being
transformed
back
again
into
pigs
they
will
devour
you
wondergood
but
i
do
not
wish
either
to
prattle
or
to
lie
throw
your
money
into
the
sea
or
build
some
new
prisons
and
gallows
you
are
vain
like
all
men
then
go
on
building
gallows
you
will
be
respected
by
serious
people
while
the
flock
in
general
will
call
you
great
or
do
you
american
from
illinois
want
to
get
into
the
pantheon
no
magnus
blood
cried
magnus
ca
you
see
that
it
is
everywhere
here
it
is
on
your
boot
now
i
confess
that
at
the
moment
magnus
appeared
to
be
insane
i
jerked
my
foot
in
sudden
fear
and
only
then
did
i
perceive
a
dark
reddish
spot
on
my
shoe
how
dastardly
magnus
smiled
and
immediately
regaining
his
composure
continued
calmly
and
without
emotion
i
have
unwittingly
startled
you
wondergood
nonsense
you
probably
stepped
on
something
inadvertently
a
mere
trifle
but
this
conversation
a
conversation
i
have
not
conducted
for
a
number
of
years
makes
me
uneasy
and
good
night
wondergood
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
presenting
you
to
my
daughter
and
now
you
will
permit
me
and
so
on
in
short
this
gentleman
conducted
me
to
my
room
in
a
most
impolite
manner
and
well
nigh
put
me
to
bed
i
offered
no
resistance
why
should
i
i
must
say
that
i
did
not
like
him
at
this
moment
i
was
even
pleased
when
he
turned
to
go
but
suddenly
he
turned
at
the
very
threshold
and
stepping
forward
stretched
out
his
large
white
hands
and
murmured
do
you
see
these
hands
there
is
blood
on
them
let
it
be
the
blood
of
a
scoundrel
a
torturer
a
tyrant
but
it
is
the
same
red
human
blood
good
night
he
spoiled
my
night
for
me
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
that
on
that
night
i
felt
great
pleasure
in
being
a
man
and
i
made
myself
thoroughly
at
home
in
his
narrow
human
skin
it
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
in
the
armpits
you
see
i
bought
it
ready
made
and
thought
that
it
would
be
as
comfortable
as
if
it
had
been
made
to
measure
i
was
highly
emotional
i
was
extremely
good
and
affable
i
was
very
eager
to
play
but
i
was
not
inclined
to
tragedy
blood
how
can
any
person
of
good
breeding
thrust
his
white
hands
under
the
nose
of
a
stranger
hangmen
have
very
white
hands
do
not
think
i
am
jesting
i
did
not
feel
well
in
the
daytime
i
still
manage
to
subdue
wondergood
but
at
night
he
lays
his
hands
upon
me
it
is
he
who
fills
me
with
his
silly
dreams
and
shakes
within
me
his
entire
dusty
archive
and
how
godlessly
silly
and
meaningless
are
his
dreams
he
fusses
about
within
me
all
night
long
like
a
returned
master
seems
to
be
looking
about
for
something
grumbles
about
losses
and
wear
and
tear
and
sneezes
and
cavorts
about
like
a
dog
lying
uncomfortable
on
its
bed
it
is
he
who
draws
me
in
at
night
like
a
mass
of
wet
lime
into
the
depths
of
miserable
humanity
where
i
nearly
choke
to
death
when
i
awake
in
the
morning
i
feel
that
wondergood
has
infused
ten
more
degrees
of
human
into
me
think
of
it
he
may
soon
eject
me
all
together
and
leave
me
standing
outside
he
the
miserable
owner
of
an
empty
barn
into
which
i
brought
breath
and
soul
like
a
hurried
thief
i
crawled
into
a
stranger
clothes
the
pockets
of
which
are
bulging
with
forged
promissory
notes
no
still
worse
it
is
not
only
uncomfortable
attire
it
is
a
low
dark
and
stifling
jail
wherein
i
occupy
less
space
than
a
ring
might
in
the
stomach
of
wondergood
you
my
dear
reader
have
been
hidden
in
your
prison
from
childhood
and
you
even
seem
to
like
it
but
i
i
come
from
the
kingdom
of
liberty
and
i
refuse
to
be
wondergood
tape
worm
one
swallow
of
poison
and
i
am
free
again
what
will
you
say
then
scoundrel
wondergood
without
me
you
will
be
devoured
by
the
worms
you
will
crack
open
at
the
seams
miserable
carcass
touch
me
not
on
this
night
however
i
was
in
the
absolute
power
of
wondergood
what
is
human
blood
to
me
what
do
i
care
about
the
troubles
of
life
but
wondergood
was
quite
aroused
by
the
crazy
magnus
suddenly
i
felt
just
think
of
it
that
i
am
filled
with
blood
like
the
bladder
of
an
ox
and
the
bladder
is
very
thin
and
weak
so
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
prick
it
prick
it
and
out
spurts
the
blood
i
was
terrified
at
the
idea
that
i
might
be
killed
in
this
house
that
some
one
might
cut
my
throat
and
turning
me
upside
down
hanging
by
the
legs
would
let
the
blood
run
out
upon
the
floor
i
lay
in
the
darkness
and
strained
my
ears
to
hear
whether
or
not
magnus
was
approaching
with
his
white
hands
and
the
greater
the
silence
in
this
cursed
house
the
more
terrified
i
grew
even
toppi
failed
to
snore
as
usual
this
made
me
angry
then
my
body
began
to
ache
perhaps
i
was
injured
in
the
wreck
or
was
it
weariness
brought
on
by
the
flight
then
my
body
began
to
itch
in
the
most
ordinary
way
and
i
even
began
to
move
the
feet
it
was
the
appearance
of
the
jovial
clown
in
the
tragedy
suddenly
a
dream
seized
me
by
the
feet
and
dragged
me
rapidly
below
i
hardly
had
time
enough
to
shout
and
what
nonsense
arose
before
me
do
you
ever
have
such
dreams
i
felt
that
i
was
a
bottle
of
champagne
with
a
thin
neck
and
sealed
but
filled
not
with
wine
but
with
blood
and
it
seemed
that
not
only
i
but
all
people
had
become
bottles
with
sealed
tops
and
all
of
us
were
arranged
in
a
row
on
a
seashore
and
someone
horrible
was
approaching
from
somewhere
and
wanted
to
smash
us
all
and
i
saw
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
do
so
and
wanted
to
shout
do
smash
them
get
a
corkscrew
but
i
had
no
voice
i
was
a
bottle
suddenly
the
dead
lackey
george
approached
in
his
hands
was
a
huge
sharp
corkscrew
he
said
something
and
seized
me
by
the
throat
ah
ah
by
the
throat
i
awoke
in
pain
apparently
he
did
try
to
open
me
up
my
wrath
was
so
great
that
i
neither
sighed
nor
smiled
nor
moved
i
simply
killed
wondergood
again
i
gnashed
my
teeth
straightened
out
my
eyes
closed
them
calmly
stretched
out
at
full
length
and
lay
peacefully
in
the
full
consciousness
of
the
greatness
of
my
ego
had
the
ocean
itself
moved
up
on
me
i
would
not
have
batted
an
eye
get
thee
hence
my
friend
i
wish
to
be
alone
and
the
body
grew
silent
colorless
airy
and
empty
again
with
light
step
i
left
it
and
before
my
eyes
there
arose
a
vision
of
the
that
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
your
language
my
poor
friend
satisfy
your
curiosity
with
the
dream
i
have
just
confided
to
you
and
ask
no
more
or
does
not
the
huge
sharp
corkscrew
suit
you
but
it
is
so
artistic
in
the
morning
i
was
well
again
refreshed
and
beautiful
i
yearned
for
the
play
like
an
actor
who
has
just
left
his
dressing
room
of
course
i
did
not
forget
to
shave
this
canaille
wondergood
gets
overgrown
with
hair
as
quickly
as
his
golden
skinned
pigs
i
complained
about
this
to
toppi
with
whom
while
waiting
for
magnus
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
and
toppi
thinking
a
while
replied
philosophically
yes
man
sleeps
and
his
beard
grows
this
is
as
it
should
be
for
the
barbers
magnus
appeared
he
was
no
more
hospitable
than
yesterday
and
his
pale
face
carried
unmistakable
indications
of
weariness
but
he
was
calm
and
polite
how
black
his
beard
is
in
the
daytime
he
pressed
my
hand
in
cold
politeness
and
said
we
were
perched
on
a
wall
you
are
enjoying
the
roman
campagna
wondergood
a
magnificent
sight
it
is
said
that
the
campagna
is
noted
for
its
fevers
but
there
is
but
one
fever
it
produces
in
me
the
fever
of
thought
apparently
wondergood
did
not
have
much
of
a
liking
for
nature
and
i
have
not
yet
managed
to
develop
a
taste
for
earthly
landscape
an
empty
field
for
me
i
cast
my
eyes
politely
over
the
countryside
before
us
and
said
people
interest
me
more
signor
magnus
he
gazed
at
me
intently
with
his
dark
eyes
and
lowering
his
voice
said
dryly
and
with
apparent
reluctance
just
two
words
about
people
wondergood
you
will
soon
see
my
daughter
maria
she
is
my
three
billions
you
understand
i
nodded
my
head
in
approval
but
your
california
does
not
produce
such
gold
neither
does
any
other
country
on
this
dirty
earth
it
is
the
gold
of
the
heavens
i
am
not
a
believer
wondergood
but
even
i
experience
some
doubts
when
i
meet
the
gaze
of
my
maria
hers
are
the
only
hands
into
which
you
might
without
the
slightest
misgiving
place
your
billions
i
am
an
old
bachelor
and
i
was
overcome
with
fear
but
magnus
continued
sternly
with
a
ring
of
triumph
in
his
voice
but
she
will
not
accept
them
sir
her
gentle
hands
must
never
touch
this
golden
dirt
her
clean
eyes
will
never
behold
any
sight
but
that
of
this
endless
godless
campagna
here
is
her
monastery
wondergood
and
there
is
but
one
exit
for
her
from
here
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
it
does
exist
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
can
not
understand
this
my
dear
magnus
i
protested
in
great
joy
life
and
people
the
face
of
thomas
magnus
grew
angry
as
it
did
yesterday
and
in
stern
ridicule
he
interrupted
me
and
i
beg
you
to
grasp
wondergood
that
life
and
people
are
not
for
maria
it
is
enough
that
i
know
them
my
duty
was
to
you
and
now
he
again
assumed
the
attitude
of
cold
politeness
i
ask
you
to
come
to
my
table
you
too
mr
toppi
we
had
begun
to
eat
and
were
chattering
of
small
matters
when
entered
the
door
through
which
she
entered
was
behind
my
back
i
mistook
her
soft
step
for
those
of
the
maid
carrying
the
dishes
but
i
was
astonished
by
the
toppi
sitting
opposite
me
his
eyes
grew
round
like
circles
his
face
red
as
if
he
were
choking
his
adam
apple
seemed
to
be
lifted
above
his
neck
as
if
driven
by
a
wave
and
to
disappear
again
somewhere
behind
his
narrow
ministerial
collar
of
course
i
thought
he
was
choking
to
death
with
a
fishbone
and
shouted
toppi
what
is
the
matter
with
you
take
some
water
but
magnus
was
already
on
his
feet
announcing
coldly
my
daughter
maria
henry
wondergood
i
turned
about
quickly
and
how
can
i
express
the
extraordinary
when
it
is
inexpressible
it
was
something
more
than
beautiful
it
was
terrible
in
its
beauty
i
do
not
want
to
seek
comparisons
i
shall
leave
that
to
you
take
all
that
you
have
ever
seen
or
ever
known
of
the
beautiful
on
earth
the
lily
the
stars
the
sun
but
add
add
still
more
but
not
this
was
the
awful
aspect
of
it
there
was
something
else
the
elusive
yet
astonishing
similarity
to
whom
whom
have
i
met
upon
this
earth
who
was
so
beautiful
so
beautiful
and
and
unapproachable
i
have
learned
by
this
time
your
entire
archive
wondergood
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
comes
from
your
modest
gallery
madonna
mumbled
toppi
in
a
hoarse
voice
scared
out
of
his
wits
so
that
is
it
yes
madonna
the
fool
was
right
and
i
satan
could
understand
his
terror
madonna
whom
people
see
only
in
churches
in
paintings
in
the
imagination
of
artists
maria
the
name
which
rings
only
in
hymns
and
prayer
books
heavenly
beauty
mercy
forgiveness
and
love
star
of
the
seas
do
you
like
that
name
star
of
the
seas
it
was
really
devilishly
funny
i
made
a
deep
bow
and
almost
blurted
out
madam
i
beg
pardon
for
my
unbidden
intrusion
but
i
really
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
i
most
humbly
beg
your
pardon
but
i
could
not
imagine
that
this
black
bearded
fellow
has
the
honor
of
having
you
for
his
daughter
a
thousand
times
i
crave
your
pardon
for
but
enough
i
said
something
else
how
do
you
do
signorina
it
is
indeed
a
pleasure
and
she
really
did
not
indicate
in
any
way
that
she
was
acquainted
with
me
one
must
respect
an
incognito
if
one
would
remain
a
gentleman
and
only
a
scoundrel
would
dare
to
tear
a
mask
from
a
lady
face
this
would
have
been
all
the
more
impossible
because
her
father
thomas
magnus
continued
to
urge
us
with
a
chuckle
do
eat
please
toppi
why
do
you
not
drink
wondergood
the
wine
is
splendid
in
the
course
of
what
followed
she
breathed
she
blinked
she
ate
and
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
about
eighteen
years
of
age
and
her
dress
was
white
and
her
throat
bare
it
was
really
laughable
i
gazed
at
her
bare
neck
and
believe
me
my
earthly
friend
i
am
not
easily
seduced
i
am
not
a
romantic
youth
but
i
am
not
old
by
any
means
i
am
not
at
all
bad
looking
i
enjoy
an
independent
position
in
the
world
and
do
you
like
the
combination
satan
and
and
satan
in
evidence
of
the
seriousness
of
my
intentions
i
can
submit
at
that
moment
i
thought
more
of
descendants
and
sought
a
name
for
than
indulged
in
frivolity
suddenly
toppi
adam
apple
gave
a
jerk
and
he
inquired
hoarsely
has
any
one
ever
painted
your
portrait
signorina
maria
never
poses
for
painters
broke
in
magnus
sternly
i
felt
like
laughing
at
the
fool
toppi
i
had
already
opened
wide
my
mouth
filled
with
a
set
of
american
teeth
when
maria
pure
gaze
pierced
my
eyes
and
everything
flew
to
the
devil
as
in
that
moment
of
the
railway
catastrophe
you
understand
she
turned
me
inside
out
like
a
stocking
or
how
shall
i
put
it
my
fine
parisian
costume
was
driven
inside
of
me
and
my
still
finer
thoughts
which
however
i
would
not
have
wanted
to
convey
to
the
lady
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
surface
with
all
my
secrecy
i
was
left
no
more
sealed
than
a
room
in
a
fifteen
cent
lodging
house
but
she
me
said
nothing
and
threw
her
gaze
like
a
projector
in
the
direction
of
toppi
illumining
his
entire
body
you
too
would
have
laughed
had
you
seen
how
this
poor
old
devil
was
set
aglow
and
aflame
by
this
gaze
clear
from
the
prayer
book
to
the
fishbone
with
which
he
nearly
choked
to
death
fortunately
for
both
of
us
magnus
arose
and
invited
us
to
follow
him
into
the
garden
come
let
us
go
into
the
garden
said
he
maria
will
show
you
her
favorite
flowers
yes
maria
but
seek
no
songs
of
praise
from
me
oh
poet
i
was
mad
i
was
as
provoked
as
a
man
whose
closet
has
just
been
ransacked
by
a
burglar
i
wanted
to
gaze
at
maria
but
was
compelled
to
look
upon
the
foolish
flowers
because
i
dared
not
lift
my
eyes
i
am
a
gentleman
and
can
not
appear
before
a
lady
without
a
necktie
i
was
seized
by
a
curious
humility
do
you
like
to
feel
humble
i
do
not
i
do
not
know
what
maria
said
but
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
her
gaze
and
her
entire
uncanny
countenance
was
the
embodiment
of
an
meaning
so
that
any
wise
word
i
might
have
uttered
would
have
sounded
meaningless
the
wisdom
of
words
is
necessary
only
for
those
poor
in
spirit
the
right
are
silent
take
note
of
that
little
poet
sage
and
eternal
chatterbox
wherever
you
may
be
let
it
be
sufficient
for
you
that
i
have
humbled
myself
to
speak
ah
but
i
have
forgotten
my
humility
she
walked
and
i
and
toppi
crawled
after
her
i
detested
myself
and
this
toppi
because
of
his
hanging
nose
and
large
pale
ears
what
was
needed
here
was
an
apollo
and
not
a
pair
of
ordinary
americans
we
felt
quite
relieved
when
she
had
gone
and
we
were
left
alone
with
magnus
it
was
all
so
sweet
and
simple
toppi
abandoned
his
religious
airs
and
i
crossed
my
legs
comfortably
lit
a
cigar
and
fixed
my
gaze
upon
the
whites
of
magnus
eyes
you
must
be
off
to
rome
wondergood
they
are
probably
worrying
about
you
said
our
host
in
a
tone
of
loving
concern
i
can
send
toppi
i
replied
he
smiled
and
added
ironically
i
hardly
think
that
would
be
sufficient
mr
wondergood
i
sought
to
clasp
his
great
white
hand
but
it
did
not
seem
to
move
closer
but
i
caught
it
just
the
same
pressed
it
warmly
and
he
was
compelled
to
return
the
pressure
very
well
signor
magnus
i
am
off
at
once
i
said
i
have
already
sent
for
the
carriage
he
replied
is
not
the
campagna
beautiful
in
the
morning
i
again
took
a
polite
look
at
the
and
said
with
emotion
yes
it
is
beautiful
irwin
my
friend
leave
us
for
a
moment
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
signor
magnus
toppi
left
and
signor
magnus
opened
wide
his
big
sad
eyes
i
again
tried
my
steel
on
him
and
bending
forward
closer
to
his
dark
face
i
asked
have
you
ever
observed
magnus
the
very
striking
resemblance
between
your
daughter
the
signorina
maria
and
a
certain
celebrated
personage
do
you
think
she
resembles
the
madonna
madonna
drawled
out
magnus
no
wondergood
i
noticed
that
i
never
go
to
church
but
i
fear
you
will
be
late
the
roman
fever
i
again
seized
his
white
hand
and
shook
it
vigorously
no
i
did
not
tear
it
off
and
from
my
eyes
there
burst
forth
again
two
tears
let
us
speak
plainly
signor
magnus
said
i
i
am
a
straightforward
man
and
have
grown
to
love
you
do
you
want
to
come
along
with
me
and
be
the
lord
of
my
billions
magnus
was
silent
his
hand
lay
motionless
in
mine
his
eyes
were
lowered
and
something
dark
seemed
to
pass
over
his
face
then
immediately
to
disappear
finally
he
said
seriously
and
simply
i
understand
you
wondergood
but
i
must
refuse
no
i
will
not
go
with
you
i
have
failed
to
tell
you
one
thing
but
your
frankness
and
confidence
in
me
compels
me
to
say
that
i
must
to
a
certain
extent
steer
clear
of
the
police
the
roman
police
i
asked
betraying
a
slight
excitement
nonsense
we
shall
buy
it
no
the
international
he
replied
i
hope
you
do
not
think
that
i
have
committed
some
base
crime
the
trouble
is
not
with
police
which
can
be
bought
you
are
right
wondergood
when
you
say
that
one
can
buy
almost
any
one
the
truth
is
that
i
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
what
do
you
want
me
for
you
love
humanity
and
i
detest
it
at
best
i
am
indifferent
to
it
let
it
live
and
not
interfere
with
me
leave
me
my
maria
leave
me
the
right
and
strength
to
detest
people
as
i
read
the
history
of
their
life
leave
me
my
campagna
and
that
is
all
i
want
and
all
of
which
i
am
capable
all
the
oil
within
me
has
burned
out
wondergood
you
see
before
you
an
extinguished
lamp
hanging
on
a
wall
a
lamp
which
once
goodbye
i
do
not
ask
your
confidence
magnus
i
interjected
pardon
me
you
will
never
receive
it
wondergood
my
name
is
an
invention
but
it
is
the
only
one
i
can
offer
to
my
friends
to
tell
the
truth
i
liked
thomas
magnus
at
that
moment
he
spoke
bravely
and
simply
in
his
face
one
could
read
stubbornness
and
will
this
man
knew
the
value
of
human
life
and
had
the
mien
of
one
condemned
to
death
but
it
was
the
mien
of
a
proud
uncompromising
criminal
who
will
never
accept
the
ministrations
of
a
priest
for
a
moment
i
thought
my
father
had
many
bastard
children
deprived
of
legacy
and
wandering
about
the
world
perhaps
thomas
magnus
is
one
of
these
wanderers
and
is
it
possible
that
i
have
met
a
on
this
earth
very
interesting
but
from
a
purely
human
business
point
of
view
one
can
not
help
but
respect
a
man
whose
hands
are
steeped
in
blood
i
saluted
changed
my
position
and
in
the
humblest
possible
manner
asked
magnus
permission
to
visit
him
occasionally
and
seek
his
advice
he
hesitated
but
finally
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
agreed
very
well
wondergood
you
may
come
i
hope
to
hear
from
you
things
that
may
supplement
the
knowledge
i
glean
from
my
books
and
by
the
way
toppi
has
made
an
excellent
impression
upon
my
maria
toppi
yes
she
has
found
a
striking
resemblance
between
him
and
one
of
her
favorite
saints
she
goes
to
church
frequently
toppi
a
saint
or
has
his
prayer
book
overbalanced
his
huge
back
and
the
fishbone
in
his
throat
magnus
gazed
at
me
almost
gently
and
only
his
thin
nose
seemed
to
tremble
slightly
with
restrained
it
is
very
pleasant
to
know
that
behind
this
austere
exterior
there
is
so
much
quiet
and
restrained
merriment
it
was
twilight
when
we
left
magnus
followed
us
to
the
threshold
but
maria
remained
in
seclusion
the
little
white
house
surrounded
by
the
cypress
trees
was
as
quiet
and
silent
as
we
found
it
yesterday
but
the
silence
was
of
a
different
character
the
silence
was
the
soul
of
maria
i
confess
that
i
felt
rather
sad
at
this
departure
but
very
soon
came
a
new
series
of
impressions
which
dispelled
this
feeling
we
were
approaching
rome
we
entered
the
brightly
illuminated
densely
populated
streets
through
some
opening
in
the
city
wall
and
the
first
thing
we
saw
in
the
eternal
city
was
a
creaking
trolley
car
trying
to
make
its
way
through
the
same
hole
in
the
wall
toppi
who
was
acquainted
with
rome
revelled
in
the
familiar
atmosphere
of
the
churches
we
were
passing
and
indicated
with
his
long
finger
the
of
ancient
rome
which
seemed
to
be
clinging
to
the
huge
wall
of
the
new
structures
just
as
if
the
latter
had
been
bombarded
with
the
shells
of
old
and
fragments
of
the
missiles
had
clung
to
the
bricks
here
and
there
we
came
upon
additional
heaps
of
this
old
rubbish
above
a
low
parapet
of
stone
we
observed
a
dark
shallow
ditch
and
a
large
triumphal
gate
half
sunk
in
the
earth
the
forum
exclaimed
toppi
majestically
our
coachman
nodded
his
head
in
affirmation
with
every
new
pile
of
old
stone
and
brick
the
fellow
swelled
with
pride
while
i
longed
for
my
new
york
and
its
skyscrapers
and
tried
to
calculate
the
number
of
trucks
that
would
be
necessary
to
clear
these
heaps
of
rubbish
called
ancient
rome
away
before
morning
when
i
mentioned
this
to
toppi
he
was
insulted
and
replied
you
do
understand
anything
better
close
your
eyes
and
just
reflect
that
you
are
in
rome
i
did
so
and
was
again
convinced
that
sight
is
as
much
of
an
impediment
to
the
mind
as
sound
not
without
reason
are
all
wise
folk
on
the
earth
blind
and
all
good
musicians
deaf
like
toppi
i
began
to
sniff
the
air
and
through
my
sense
of
smell
i
gathered
more
of
rome
and
its
horribly
long
and
highly
entertaining
history
than
hitherto
thus
a
decaying
leaf
in
the
woods
smells
stronger
than
the
young
and
green
foliage
will
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
sensed
the
odor
of
blood
and
nero
but
when
i
opened
my
eyes
expectantly
i
observed
a
plain
everyday
kiosk
and
a
lemonade
stand
well
how
do
you
like
it
growled
toppi
still
dissatisfied
it
smells
well
certainly
it
smells
it
will
smell
stronger
with
every
hour
these
are
old
strong
aromas
mr
wondergood
and
so
it
really
was
the
odor
grew
in
strength
i
can
not
find
comparisons
to
make
it
clear
to
you
all
the
sections
of
my
brain
began
to
move
and
buzz
like
bees
aroused
by
smoke
it
is
strange
but
it
seems
that
rome
is
included
in
the
archive
of
the
silly
wondergood
perhaps
this
is
his
native
town
when
we
approached
a
certain
populous
square
i
sensed
the
clear
odor
of
some
blood
relatives
which
was
soon
followed
by
the
conviction
that
i
too
have
walked
these
streets
before
have
i
like
toppi
previously
donned
the
human
form
ever
louder
buzzed
the
bees
my
entire
beehive
buzzed
and
suddenly
thousands
of
faces
dim
and
white
beautiful
and
horrible
began
to
dance
before
me
thousands
upon
thousands
of
voices
noises
cries
laughters
and
sighs
nearly
set
me
deaf
no
this
was
no
longer
a
beehive
it
was
a
huge
fiery
smithy
where
firearms
were
being
forged
with
the
red
sparks
flying
all
about
iron
of
course
if
i
had
lived
in
rome
before
i
must
have
been
one
of
its
emperors
i
the
expression
of
my
face
i
remember
the
movement
of
my
bare
neck
as
i
turn
my
head
i
remember
the
touch
of
golden
laurels
upon
my
bald
head
iron
ah
i
hear
the
steps
of
the
iron
legions
of
rome
i
hear
the
iron
voices
vivat
cæsar
i
am
hot
i
am
burning
or
was
i
not
an
emperor
but
simply
one
of
the
victims
when
rome
burned
down
in
accordance
with
the
magnificent
plan
of
nero
no
this
is
not
a
fire
this
is
a
funeral
pyre
on
which
i
am
forcibly
esconsced
i
hear
the
hissing
of
the
tongues
of
flame
beneath
my
feet
i
strain
my
neck
all
lined
with
blue
veins
and
in
my
throat
there
rises
the
final
curse
or
blessing
think
of
it
i
even
remember
that
roman
face
in
the
front
row
of
spectators
which
even
then
gave
me
no
rest
because
of
its
idiotic
expression
and
sleepy
eyes
i
am
being
burned
and
it
sleeps
hotel
cried
toppi
and
i
opened
my
eyes
we
were
going
up
a
hill
along
a
quiet
street
at
the
end
of
which
there
glowed
a
large
structure
worthy
even
of
new
york
it
was
the
hotel
where
we
had
previously
wired
for
reservations
they
probably
thought
we
had
perished
in
the
wreck
my
funeral
pyre
was
extinguished
i
grew
as
merry
as
a
darkey
who
has
just
escaped
from
hard
labor
and
i
whispered
to
toppi
well
toppi
and
how
about
the
madonna
interesting
i
was
frightened
at
first
and
nearly
choked
to
death
with
a
bone
you
are
silly
toppi
she
is
polite
and
did
not
recognize
you
she
simply
took
you
for
one
of
her
saints
it
is
a
pity
old
boy
that
we
have
chosen
for
ourselves
these
solemn
american
faces
had
we
looked
around
more
carefully
we
might
have
found
some
more
beautiful
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
mine
said
toppi
sadly
and
turned
away
a
glow
of
secret
appeared
upon
his
long
shiny
nose
ah
toppi
ah
the
saint
but
we
were
already
being
accorded
a
triumphal
reception
february
rome
hotel
internationale
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
magnus
i
am
thinking
too
much
of
his
madonna
of
flesh
and
bone
i
have
come
here
to
lie
and
to
play
merrily
and
i
am
not
at
all
taken
by
the
prospect
of
being
a
mediocre
actor
who
weeps
behind
the
scenes
and
appears
on
the
stage
with
his
eyes
perfectly
dry
moreover
i
have
no
time
to
gad
about
the
fields
catching
butterflies
with
a
net
like
a
boy
the
whole
of
rome
is
buzzing
about
me
i
am
an
extraordinary
man
who
loves
his
fellow
beings
and
i
am
celebrated
the
mobs
who
flock
to
worship
me
are
no
less
numerous
than
those
who
worship
the
vicar
of
christ
himself
two
popes
all
at
yes
happy
rome
can
not
consider
itself
an
orphan
i
am
now
living
at
the
hotel
where
all
is
aquiver
with
ecstacy
when
i
put
my
shoes
outside
my
door
for
the
night
but
they
are
renovating
a
palace
for
me
the
historic
villa
orsini
painters
sculptors
and
poets
are
kept
busy
one
is
already
painting
my
portrait
assuring
me
that
i
remind
him
of
one
of
the
medicis
the
other
are
sharpening
their
knives
for
him
i
ask
him
and
can
you
paint
a
madonna
certainly
he
can
it
was
he
if
the
signor
recollects
who
painted
the
famous
turk
on
the
cigarette
boxes
the
turk
whose
fame
is
known
even
in
america
and
now
three
are
painting
madonnas
for
me
the
rest
are
running
about
rome
seeking
models
i
said
to
one
in
my
barbarous
american
ignorance
of
the
higher
arts
but
if
you
find
such
a
model
signor
just
bring
her
to
me
why
waste
paint
and
canvas
he
was
evidently
pained
and
mumbled
ah
signor
a
model
i
think
he
took
me
for
a
merchant
in
live
stock
but
fool
why
do
i
need
your
aid
for
which
i
must
pay
a
commission
when
my
is
filled
with
a
flock
of
beauties
they
all
worship
me
i
remind
them
of
savanarola
and
they
seek
to
transform
every
dark
corner
in
my
drawing
room
and
every
soft
couch
into
a
confessional
i
am
so
glad
that
these
society
ladies
like
the
painters
know
so
well
the
history
of
their
country
and
realize
who
i
am
the
joy
of
the
roman
papers
on
finding
that
i
did
not
perish
in
the
wreck
and
lost
neither
my
legs
nor
my
billions
was
equal
to
the
joy
of
the
papers
of
jerusalem
on
the
day
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
in
reality
there
was
little
cause
for
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
latter
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
read
history
i
feared
that
i
might
remind
the
journalists
of
cæsar
but
fortunately
they
think
little
of
the
past
and
confined
themselves
to
pointing
out
my
resemblance
to
president
wilson
scoundrels
they
were
simply
flattering
my
american
patriotism
to
the
majority
however
i
recall
a
prophet
but
they
do
not
know
which
one
on
this
point
they
are
modestly
silent
at
any
rate
it
is
not
mahomet
my
opposition
to
marriage
is
well
known
at
all
telegraph
stations
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
filth
on
which
i
fed
my
hungry
interviewers
like
an
experienced
i
gaze
with
horror
on
the
mess
they
feed
upon
they
eat
and
yet
they
live
although
i
must
admit
i
do
not
see
them
growing
fat
yesterday
morning
i
flew
in
an
aeroplane
over
rome
and
the
campagna
you
will
probably
ask
whether
i
saw
maria
home
no
i
did
not
find
it
how
can
one
find
a
grain
of
sand
among
a
myriad
of
other
grains
but
i
really
did
not
look
for
it
i
felt
at
the
great
altitude
but
my
good
interviewers
restless
and
impatient
were
astounded
by
my
coolness
and
courage
one
fellow
strong
surly
and
bearded
who
reminded
me
of
hannibal
was
the
first
to
reach
me
after
the
flight
and
asked
did
not
the
sensation
of
flying
in
the
air
wondergood
the
feeling
of
having
conquered
the
elements
thrill
you
with
a
sense
of
pride
in
man
who
has
subdued
he
repeated
the
question
they
do
seem
to
trust
me
somehow
and
are
always
suggesting
the
proper
answers
but
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
exclaimed
sadly
can
you
imagine
signor
no
only
once
did
i
have
a
sense
of
pride
in
men
and
that
was
in
the
lavatory
on
board
the
oh
in
the
lavatory
but
what
happened
a
storm
and
you
were
astounded
by
the
genius
of
man
who
has
subdued
nothing
extraordinary
happened
but
i
was
astounded
by
the
genius
of
man
who
managed
to
create
a
palace
out
of
such
a
disgusting
necessity
as
a
lavatory
oh
a
real
temple
in
which
one
is
the
arch
priest
permit
me
to
make
a
note
of
that
it
is
such
an
original
illumination
of
the
problem
and
the
whole
eternal
city
was
feeding
on
this
sally
not
only
did
they
not
request
me
to
leave
the
place
but
on
the
contrary
this
was
the
day
of
the
first
official
visits
to
my
apartments
something
on
the
order
of
a
minister
of
state
an
ambassador
or
some
other
palace
chef
came
and
poured
sugar
and
cinnamon
all
over
me
as
if
i
were
a
pudding
later
in
the
day
i
returned
the
visits
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
keep
such
things
need
i
say
that
i
have
a
nephew
every
american
millionaire
has
a
nephew
in
europe
my
nephew
name
is
also
wondergood
he
is
connected
with
some
legation
is
very
correct
in
manners
and
his
bald
spot
is
so
oiled
that
my
kiss
could
serve
me
as
a
breakfast
were
i
fond
of
scented
oil
but
one
must
be
willing
to
sacrifice
something
especially
the
gratification
of
a
sense
of
smell
the
kiss
cost
me
not
a
cent
while
it
meant
a
great
deal
to
the
young
man
it
opened
for
him
a
wide
credit
on
soap
and
perfumery
but
enough
when
i
look
at
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
reflect
that
they
are
just
as
they
were
at
the
court
of
aschurbanipal
and
that
for
the
past
years
the
pieces
of
silver
received
by
judas
continue
to
bear
interest
like
his
kiss
i
grow
bored
with
this
old
and
threadbare
play
ah
i
want
a
great
play
i
seek
originality
and
talent
i
want
beautiful
lines
and
bold
strokes
this
company
here
casts
me
in
the
rôle
of
an
old
brass
band
conductor
at
times
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
really
worth
my
while
to
have
undertaken
such
a
long
journey
for
the
sake
of
this
old
drivel
to
exchange
ancient
magnificent
and
hell
for
its
miserable
replica
in
truth
i
am
sorry
that
magnus
and
his
madonna
refused
to
join
me
we
would
have
played
a
little
just
a
little
i
have
had
but
one
interesting
morning
in
fact
i
was
quite
excited
the
congregation
of
a
free
church
composed
of
very
serious
men
and
women
who
insist
upon
worshipping
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
invited
me
to
deliver
a
sunday
sermon
i
donned
a
black
frock
coat
which
gave
me
a
close
resemblance
to
toppi
went
through
a
number
of
particularly
expressive
gestures
before
my
mirror
and
was
driven
in
an
automobile
like
a
prophet
moderne
to
the
service
i
took
as
my
subject
or
text
jesus
advice
to
the
rich
youth
to
distribute
his
wealth
among
the
poor
and
in
not
more
than
half
an
hour
i
demonstrated
as
conclusively
as
and
make
that
love
of
one
neighbor
is
the
all
important
thing
like
a
practical
and
careful
american
however
i
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
try
and
go
after
the
whole
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
one
shot
and
to
distribute
one
wealth
carelessly
that
one
can
buy
it
up
in
lots
on
the
instalment
plan
and
by
easy
payments
the
faces
of
the
faithful
bore
a
look
of
extreme
concentration
they
were
apparently
figuring
out
something
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
on
the
basis
i
suggested
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
attainable
for
the
pockets
of
all
of
them
unfortunately
a
number
of
my
compatriots
were
present
in
the
congregation
one
of
them
was
about
to
rise
to
his
feet
to
propose
the
formation
of
a
stock
company
when
i
realized
the
danger
and
frustrated
this
plan
by
letting
loose
a
fountain
of
emotion
and
thus
extinguished
his
religiously
practical
zeal
what
did
i
not
talk
about
i
wept
for
my
sad
childhood
spent
in
labor
and
privation
i
whined
about
my
poor
father
who
perished
in
a
match
factory
i
prayed
solemnly
for
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
in
christ
the
swamp
i
created
was
so
huge
that
the
journalists
caught
enough
wild
ducks
to
last
them
for
six
months
how
we
wept
i
shivered
with
the
dampness
and
began
to
beat
energetically
the
drum
of
my
billions
everything
for
others
not
a
cent
for
me
with
a
brazenness
worthy
of
the
whip
i
concluded
with
the
words
of
the
great
teacher
come
ye
unto
me
all
who
are
and
weary
and
i
will
comfort
ye
ah
what
a
pity
i
can
not
perform
miracles
a
little
practical
miracle
something
on
the
order
of
transforming
a
bottle
of
water
into
one
of
sour
chianti
or
some
of
the
worshippers
into
pastry
would
have
gone
a
long
way
at
that
you
laugh
and
are
angry
my
earthy
reader
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
act
thus
remember
only
that
the
can
not
be
expressed
in
your
ventriloquist
language
and
that
my
words
are
merely
a
cursed
mask
for
my
thoughts
maria
you
will
read
of
my
success
in
the
newspapers
there
was
one
fool
however
who
almost
spoiled
my
day
for
me
he
was
a
member
of
the
salvation
army
he
came
to
see
me
and
suggested
that
i
immediately
take
up
a
trumpet
and
lead
the
army
into
battle
they
were
too
cheap
laurels
he
offered
and
i
drove
him
out
but
toppi
he
was
triumphantly
silent
all
the
way
home
and
finally
he
said
very
respectfully
you
were
in
fine
mettle
wondergood
i
even
wept
it
is
a
pity
that
neither
magnus
nor
his
daughter
heard
you
preach
she
she
would
have
changed
her
opinion
of
us
you
understand
of
course
that
i
felt
like
kicking
this
admirer
out
of
the
carriage
i
again
felt
in
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
the
piercing
sting
of
hers
the
speed
with
which
i
was
again
turned
inside
out
and
spread
out
on
a
plate
for
the
public
view
is
equal
only
to
that
with
which
an
experienced
waiter
opens
a
can
of
conserves
i
drew
my
top
hat
over
my
eyes
raised
the
collar
of
my
coat
and
looking
very
much
like
a
tragedian
just
hissed
off
the
stage
i
rode
silently
and
without
acknowledging
the
greetings
showered
upon
me
i
proceeded
to
my
apartments
ah
that
gaze
of
maria
and
how
could
i
have
acknowledged
the
greetings
when
i
had
no
cane
with
me
i
have
declined
all
of
invitations
and
am
at
home
i
am
engaged
in
religious
meditation
this
was
how
toppi
announced
it
to
the
journalists
he
has
really
begun
to
respect
me
before
me
are
whiskey
and
champagne
i
am
slowly
filling
up
on
the
liquor
while
from
the
dining
hall
below
come
the
distant
strains
of
music
my
wondergood
was
apparently
considerable
of
a
drunkard
and
every
night
he
drags
me
to
the
wineshop
to
which
i
interpose
no
objection
the
difference
fortunately
his
intoxication
is
of
a
merry
kind
and
we
make
quite
a
pleasant
time
of
it
at
first
we
cast
our
dull
eyes
over
the
furniture
and
involuntarily
begin
to
calculate
the
value
of
all
this
bronze
these
carpets
venetian
mirrors
etc
a
trifle
we
agree
and
with
peculiar
we
lose
ourselves
in
the
contemplation
of
our
own
billions
of
our
power
and
our
remarkable
wisdom
and
character
our
bliss
increases
with
each
additional
glass
with
peculiar
pleasure
we
wallow
in
the
cheap
luxury
of
the
hotel
and
think
of
it
i
am
actually
beginning
to
have
a
liking
for
bronze
carpets
glass
and
stones
my
puritan
toppi
condemns
luxury
it
reminds
him
of
sodom
and
gommorah
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
part
with
these
little
emotional
pleasures
how
silly
of
me
we
continue
to
listen
dully
and
to
the
music
and
venture
to
whistle
some
accompaniments
we
add
a
little
contemplation
on
the
decollete
of
the
ladies
and
then
with
our
step
still
firm
we
proceed
to
our
resting
room
but
we
were
just
ready
for
bed
when
suddenly
i
felt
as
if
some
one
had
struck
me
a
blow
and
i
was
immediately
seized
with
a
tempest
of
tears
of
love
and
sadness
the
extraordinary
suddenly
found
expression
i
grew
as
broad
as
space
as
deep
as
eternity
and
i
embraced
all
in
a
single
breath
but
oh
what
sadness
oh
what
love
maria
but
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
subterranean
lake
in
the
belly
of
wondergood
and
my
storms
in
no
way
disturb
his
firm
tread
i
am
only
a
solitaire
in
his
stomach
of
which
he
seeks
to
rid
himself
we
ring
for
the
servants
soda
i
am
simply
drunk
arrivederci
signor
buona
notte
february
rome
hotel
internationale
yesterday
i
visited
magnus
i
was
compelled
to
wait
long
for
him
in
the
garden
and
when
he
did
appear
he
was
so
cold
and
indifferent
that
i
felt
like
leaving
i
observed
a
few
gray
hairs
in
his
black
beard
i
had
not
noticed
them
before
was
maria
unwell
i
appeared
concerned
everything
here
is
so
uncertain
that
on
leaving
a
person
for
one
hour
one
may
have
to
seek
him
in
eternity
maria
is
well
thank
you
replied
magnus
frigidly
he
seemed
surprised
as
if
my
question
were
presumptuous
and
improper
and
how
are
your
affairs
wondergood
the
roman
papers
are
filled
with
news
of
you
you
are
scoring
a
big
success
with
pain
aggravated
by
the
absence
of
maria
i
revealed
to
magnus
my
disappointment
and
my
ennui
i
spoke
well
not
without
wit
and
sarcasm
i
grew
more
and
more
provoked
by
his
lack
of
attention
and
interest
plainly
written
on
his
pale
and
weary
face
not
once
did
he
smile
or
venture
to
put
any
questions
but
when
i
reached
the
story
of
my
nephew
he
frowned
in
displeasure
and
said
fie
this
is
a
cheap
variety
farce
how
can
you
occupy
yourself
with
such
trifles
mr
wondergood
i
replied
angrily
but
it
is
not
i
who
am
occupying
myself
with
them
signor
magnus
and
how
about
the
interviews
what
about
that
flight
of
yours
you
should
drive
them
away
this
humbles
your
three
billions
and
is
it
true
that
you
delivered
some
sort
of
a
sermon
the
joy
of
play
forsook
me
unwilling
as
magnus
was
to
listen
to
me
i
told
him
all
about
my
sermon
and
those
credulous
fools
who
swallowed
sacrilege
as
they
do
marmalade
and
did
you
expect
anything
different
mr
wondergood
i
expected
that
they
would
fall
upon
me
with
clubs
for
my
audacity
when
i
sacrilegiously
bandied
about
the
words
of
the
testament
yes
they
are
beautiful
words
agreed
magnus
but
did
you
know
that
all
their
worship
of
god
and
all
their
faith
are
nothing
but
sacrilege
when
they
term
a
wafer
the
body
of
christ
while
some
sixtus
or
pius
reigns
undisturbed
and
with
the
approval
of
all
catholics
as
the
vicar
of
christ
why
should
not
you
an
american
from
illinois
call
yourself
at
least
his
governor
this
is
not
meant
as
sacrilege
wondergood
these
are
simply
allegories
highly
convenient
for
blockheads
and
you
are
only
wasting
your
wrath
but
when
will
you
get
down
to
i
threw
up
my
hands
in
skillfully
simulated
sorrow
i
to
do
something
but
i
not
what
to
do
i
shall
probably
never
get
down
to
business
until
you
magnus
agree
to
come
to
my
aid
he
frowned
at
his
own
large
motionless
white
hands
and
then
at
me
you
are
too
credulous
wondergood
this
is
a
great
fault
when
one
has
three
billions
no
i
am
of
no
use
to
you
our
roads
are
far
apart
but
dear
magnus
i
expected
him
to
strike
me
for
this
gentle
which
i
uttered
in
my
best
possible
falsetto
but
i
ventured
to
continue
with
all
the
sweetness
i
managed
to
accumulate
in
rome
i
looked
upon
the
dim
physiognomy
of
my
friend
and
in
a
still
gentler
falsetto
i
asked
and
of
what
nationality
are
you
my
signor
magnus
i
suspect
for
some
reason
that
you
are
not
italian
he
replied
calmly
no
i
am
not
italian
but
where
is
your
country
my
country
omne
solum
liberam
libero
patria
i
suppose
you
do
not
know
latin
it
means
where
freedom
is
there
is
the
fatherland
of
every
free
man
will
you
take
breakfast
with
me
the
invitation
was
couched
in
such
icy
tones
and
maria
absence
was
so
strongly
implied
therein
that
i
was
compelled
to
decline
it
politely
the
devil
take
this
man
i
was
not
at
all
in
a
merry
mood
that
morning
i
fervently
wished
to
weep
upon
his
breast
while
he
mercilessly
threw
cold
showers
upon
my
noblest
transports
i
sighed
and
changed
my
pose
i
assumed
a
pose
prepared
especially
for
maria
speaking
in
a
low
voice
i
said
i
want
to
be
frank
with
you
signor
magnus
my
past
contains
many
dark
pages
which
i
should
like
to
redeem
i
he
quickly
interrupted
me
there
are
dark
pages
in
everybody
past
wondergood
i
myself
am
not
so
clear
of
reproach
as
to
accept
the
confession
of
such
a
worthy
gentleman
i
am
a
poor
spiritual
father
he
added
with
a
most
unpleasant
laugh
never
pardon
and
in
view
of
that
what
pleasure
could
there
be
for
you
in
your
confession
better
tell
me
something
more
about
your
nephew
is
he
young
we
spoke
about
my
nephew
and
magnus
smiled
a
pause
ensued
then
magnus
asked
whether
i
had
visited
the
vatican
gallery
and
i
bade
him
requesting
him
to
transmit
my
compliments
to
maria
i
confess
i
was
a
sorry
sight
and
felt
deeply
indebted
to
magnus
when
he
said
in
bidding
me
farewell
do
not
be
angry
with
me
wondergood
i
am
not
altogether
well
and
am
rather
worried
about
my
affairs
that
all
i
hope
to
be
more
pleasant
when
we
meet
again
but
be
so
kind
as
to
excuse
me
this
morning
i
shall
see
that
maria
gets
your
compliments
if
this
blackbearded
fellow
were
only
i
confess
i
would
have
found
a
worthy
partner
a
dozen
pickaninnies
could
not
have
licked
off
the
honeyed
expression
my
face
assumed
at
magnus
promise
to
transmit
my
greetings
to
maria
all
the
way
back
to
my
hotel
i
smiled
idiotically
at
the
back
and
afterwards
bestowed
a
kiss
on
toppi
brow
the
canaile
still
maintains
an
odor
of
fur
like
a
young
devil
i
see
there
was
profit
in
your
visit
said
toppi
significantly
how
is
magnus
daughter
you
understand
splendid
toppi
splendid
she
said
that
my
beauty
and
wisdom
reminded
her
of
solomon
toppi
smiled
condescendingly
at
my
unsuccessful
jest
the
honeyed
expression
left
my
face
and
rust
and
vinegar
took
the
place
of
the
sugar
i
locked
myself
in
my
room
and
for
a
long
time
continued
to
curse
satan
for
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
you
consider
yourself
original
my
earthly
friend
when
you
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
and
begin
to
quiver
all
over
with
the
fever
of
love
and
i
do
not
i
can
see
the
legions
of
couples
from
adam
and
eve
on
i
can
see
their
kisses
and
caresses
i
can
hear
the
words
so
cursedly
monotonous
and
i
begin
to
detest
my
own
lips
daring
to
mumble
the
mumbling
of
others
my
eyes
simulating
the
gaze
of
others
my
heart
surrendering
obediently
to
the
click
of
the
lock
of
a
house
of
shame
i
can
see
all
these
excited
animals
in
their
groaning
and
their
caresses
and
i
cry
with
revulsion
at
my
own
mass
of
bones
and
flesh
and
nerves
take
care
satan
in
human
form
deceit
is
coming
over
you
wo
you
take
maria
for
yourself
my
earthly
friend
take
her
she
is
yours
not
mine
ah
if
maria
were
my
slave
i
would
put
a
rope
around
her
neck
and
would
take
her
naked
to
the
market
place
who
will
buy
who
will
pay
the
most
for
this
unearthly
beauty
ah
do
not
hurt
the
poor
blind
merchant
open
wide
your
purses
jingle
louder
your
gold
generous
gentlemen
what
she
will
not
go
fear
not
signor
she
will
come
and
she
will
love
you
this
is
simply
her
maidenly
modesty
sir
shall
i
tie
the
other
end
of
the
rope
about
her
and
lead
her
to
your
bed
kind
sir
take
the
rope
along
with
you
i
charge
nothing
for
that
only
rid
me
of
this
heavenly
beauty
she
has
the
face
of
the
radiant
madonna
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
honorable
thomas
magnus
and
both
of
them
are
thieves
he
stole
his
white
hands
and
she
her
pristine
face
ah
but
i
am
beginning
to
play
with
you
dear
reader
that
is
a
mistake
i
have
simply
taken
the
wrong
note
book
no
it
is
not
a
mistake
it
is
worse
i
play
because
my
loneliness
is
very
great
very
deep
i
fear
it
has
no
bottom
at
all
i
stand
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
and
hurl
words
many
heavy
words
into
it
but
they
fall
without
a
sound
i
hurl
into
it
laughter
threats
and
moans
i
spit
into
it
i
fling
into
it
heaps
of
stones
and
rocks
i
throw
mountains
into
it
and
still
it
remains
silent
and
empty
no
really
there
is
no
bottom
to
this
abyss
and
we
toil
in
vain
you
and
i
my
friend
but
i
see
your
smile
and
your
cunning
laugh
you
why
i
spoke
so
sourly
of
loneliness
ah
is
love
and
you
want
to
ask
whether
i
have
a
mistress
yes
there
are
two
one
is
a
russian
countess
the
other
an
italian
countess
they
differ
only
in
the
kind
of
perfume
they
use
but
this
is
such
an
immaterial
matter
that
i
love
them
both
equally
you
probably
wish
to
ask
also
whether
i
shall
ever
visit
magnus
again
yes
i
shall
go
to
magnus
i
love
him
very
much
it
matters
little
that
his
name
is
false
and
that
his
daughter
has
the
audacity
to
resemble
the
madonna
i
have
enough
of
wondergood
in
me
to
be
particular
about
a
name
and
i
am
too
not
to
forgive
the
efforts
of
others
to
appear
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
that
the
one
is
worthy
of
the
other
february
rome
villa
orsini
cardinal
the
closest
friend
and
confidante
of
the
pope
has
paid
me
a
visit
he
was
accompanied
by
two
abbés
in
general
he
is
a
personage
whose
attentions
to
me
have
brought
me
no
small
measure
of
prestige
i
met
his
eminence
in
the
reception
hall
of
my
new
palace
toppi
was
dancing
all
about
the
priests
snatching
their
blessings
quicker
than
a
lover
does
the
kisses
of
his
mistress
six
devout
hands
hardly
managed
to
handle
one
devil
grown
pious
and
before
we
had
reached
the
threshold
of
my
study
he
actually
contrived
to
touch
the
belly
of
the
cardinal
what
ecstasy
cardinal
speaks
all
the
european
languages
and
out
of
respect
for
the
stars
and
stripes
and
my
billions
he
spoke
english
he
began
the
conversation
by
congratulating
me
upon
the
acquisition
of
the
villa
orsini
and
told
me
its
history
in
detail
for
the
past
years
this
was
quite
unexpected
very
long
at
times
confusing
and
unintelligible
so
that
i
was
compelled
like
a
real
american
ass
to
blink
constantly
but
this
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
study
my
distinguished
and
eminent
visitor
he
is
not
at
all
old
he
is
broad
shouldered
well
built
and
in
good
health
he
has
a
large
almost
square
face
an
olive
skin
with
a
bluish
tinge
upon
his
shaven
cheeks
and
his
thin
but
beautiful
hands
reveal
his
spanish
blood
before
he
dedicated
himself
to
god
cardinal
was
a
spanish
grandee
and
duke
but
his
dark
eyes
are
too
small
and
too
deeply
set
beneath
his
thick
eyebrows
and
the
distance
between
the
short
nose
and
the
thin
lips
is
too
long
all
this
reminds
me
of
some
one
but
of
whom
and
what
is
this
curious
habit
i
have
of
being
reminded
of
some
one
probably
a
saint
for
a
moment
the
cardinal
was
lost
in
thought
and
suddenly
i
recalled
yes
this
is
simply
a
shaven
this
must
be
its
sad
boundless
pensiveness
evil
gleam
within
the
narrow
pupil
but
in
a
moment
the
cardinal
laughed
jested
and
gesticulated
like
a
neapolitan
lazzarone
he
was
no
longer
telling
me
the
history
of
the
palace
he
was
playing
he
was
interpreting
it
in
facial
expression
and
dramatic
monologue
he
has
short
fingers
not
at
all
like
those
of
a
monkey
and
when
he
gesticulates
he
rather
resembles
a
penguin
while
his
voice
reminds
me
of
a
talking
parrot
who
are
you
anyhow
no
a
monkey
he
is
laughing
again
and
i
observe
that
he
really
does
not
know
how
to
laugh
it
is
as
if
he
had
learned
the
human
art
of
laughter
but
yesterday
he
likes
it
but
experiences
considerable
difficulty
in
extracting
it
from
his
throat
the
sounds
seem
to
choke
him
it
is
impossible
not
to
echo
this
strange
contagious
laughter
but
it
seems
to
break
one
jaws
and
teeth
and
to
petrify
the
muscles
it
was
really
remarkable
i
was
fascinated
when
cardinal
suddenly
cut
short
his
lecture
on
the
villa
orsini
by
a
fit
of
groaning
laughter
which
left
him
calm
and
silent
his
thin
fingers
played
with
his
rosary
he
remained
quiet
and
gazed
at
me
with
a
mien
of
deepest
reverence
and
gentle
love
something
akin
to
tears
glistened
in
his
dark
eyes
i
had
made
an
impression
upon
him
he
loved
me
what
was
i
to
do
i
gazed
into
his
square
face
kindliness
turned
to
love
love
into
passion
and
still
we
maintained
the
silence
another
moment
and
i
would
have
stifled
him
in
my
embrace
well
here
you
are
in
rome
wondergood
sweetly
sang
the
old
monkey
without
altering
his
loving
gaze
here
i
am
in
rome
i
agreed
obediently
continuing
to
gaze
upon
him
with
the
same
sinful
passion
and
do
you
know
wondergood
why
i
came
here
in
addition
of
course
to
the
pleasure
i
anticipated
in
making
your
acquaintance
i
thought
and
with
my
gaze
unchanged
replied
for
money
your
eminence
the
cardinal
shook
as
though
flapping
his
wings
laughed
and
slapped
his
knee
and
again
lost
himself
in
loving
contemplation
of
my
nose
this
dumb
reverence
to
which
i
replied
with
redoubled
zest
began
to
wield
a
peculiar
influence
upon
me
i
purposely
tell
you
all
this
in
detail
in
order
that
you
may
understand
my
wish
at
that
moment
to
begin
cavorting
about
to
sing
like
a
cock
to
tell
my
best
arkansas
anecdote
or
simply
to
invite
his
eminence
to
remove
his
regalia
and
play
a
game
of
poker
your
eminence
i
love
americans
mr
wondergood
your
eminence
in
arkansas
they
tell
a
story
ah
i
see
you
want
to
get
down
to
business
i
understand
your
impatience
money
matters
should
never
be
postponed
is
that
not
so
it
depends
entirely
upon
one
concern
in
these
matters
your
eminence
the
square
face
of
the
cardinal
grew
serious
and
in
his
eyes
there
gleamed
for
a
moment
a
ray
of
loving
reproach
i
hope
you
are
not
vexed
at
my
long
dissertation
wondergood
i
love
so
much
the
history
of
our
great
city
that
i
could
not
forego
the
pleasure
the
things
you
see
before
you
are
not
rome
there
is
no
rome
wondergood
once
upon
a
time
it
was
the
eternal
city
but
it
is
simply
a
large
city
and
the
greater
it
grows
the
further
it
is
from
eternity
where
is
that
great
spirit
which
once
illumined
it
i
shall
not
narrate
to
you
all
the
prattle
of
this
purple
parrot
his
look
his
grimaces
and
his
laughter
all
that
the
old
shaven
monkey
told
me
when
it
finally
grew
weary
was
your
misfortune
is
that
you
love
your
fellow
beings
too
much
love
your
neighbor
well
let
neighbors
love
each
other
go
on
teaching
that
but
why
do
want
to
do
it
when
one
loves
too
well
one
is
blind
to
the
shortcomings
of
the
beloved
and
still
worse
one
elevates
these
faults
to
virtues
how
can
you
reform
people
and
make
them
happy
without
realizing
their
shortcomings
or
by
ignoring
their
vices
when
one
loves
one
pities
and
pity
is
the
death
of
power
you
see
i
am
quite
frank
with
you
wondergood
and
i
repeat
love
is
weakness
love
will
get
the
money
out
of
your
pocket
and
will
squander
it
on
rouge
leave
love
to
the
lower
classes
let
them
love
each
other
demand
it
of
them
but
you
you
have
risen
to
greater
heights
gifted
with
such
power
but
what
can
i
do
your
eminence
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
it
all
from
my
childhood
on
especially
in
church
i
have
had
it
drummed
into
me
that
one
must
love
his
neighbor
and
i
believed
it
and
so
the
cardinal
grew
pensive
like
laughter
pensiveness
was
becoming
to
him
and
rendered
his
square
face
immovable
filling
it
with
dignity
and
lonely
grief
leaning
forward
with
his
lips
compressed
and
supporting
his
chin
upon
his
hand
he
fixed
his
sharp
sleepy
eyes
upon
me
there
was
much
sorrow
in
them
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
conclusion
of
my
remark
and
not
having
patience
to
do
so
sighed
and
blinked
childhood
yes
he
mumbled
still
blinking
sorrowfully
children
yes
but
you
are
no
longer
a
child
forget
this
lesson
you
must
acquire
the
heavenly
gift
of
forgetfulness
you
know
he
gnashed
his
white
teeth
and
significantly
scratched
his
nose
with
his
thin
finger
continuing
seriously
but
it
all
the
same
wondergood
you
yourself
can
not
accomplish
much
yes
yes
one
must
people
to
make
them
happy
is
that
your
noble
aim
but
the
church
alone
people
she
has
been
a
mother
and
teacher
for
thousands
of
years
her
is
the
only
one
worth
while
and
i
may
say
the
only
reliable
one
as
far
as
i
know
your
career
wondergood
you
are
an
experienced
cattle
man
and
you
know
of
course
what
means
even
in
the
matter
of
handling
such
simple
creatures
as
as
swine
he
was
startled
and
suddenly
began
to
bark
to
cough
to
whine
he
was
laughing
again
swine
that
fine
that
splendid
wondergood
but
do
not
forget
that
one
finds
the
devil
too
in
swine
ceasing
his
laughter
he
proceeded
in
teaching
others
we
learn
ourselves
i
do
not
contend
that
all
the
methods
of
education
and
training
employed
by
the
church
were
equally
successful
no
we
often
made
mistakes
but
every
one
of
our
mistakes
served
to
improve
our
methods
we
are
approaching
perfection
wondergood
we
are
approaching
perfection
i
hinted
at
the
rapid
growth
of
rationalism
which
it
seemed
to
me
threatened
to
destroy
the
perfection
of
the
church
but
cardinal
again
flapped
his
wings
and
almost
screeched
with
laughter
rationalism
you
are
a
most
talented
humorist
wondergood
tell
me
was
not
the
celebrated
mark
twain
a
countryman
of
yours
yes
yes
rationalism
just
think
a
moment
from
what
root
is
this
word
derived
and
what
does
it
mean
nescis
mi
filis
quantilla
sapientia
rigitur
orbis
ah
my
dear
wondergood
to
speak
of
ratio
on
this
earth
is
more
out
of
place
than
it
would
be
to
speak
of
a
rope
in
the
home
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
hanged
i
watched
the
old
monkey
enjoying
himself
and
i
enjoyed
myself
too
i
studied
this
mixture
of
a
monkey
parrot
penguin
fox
wolf
and
what
not
and
it
was
really
funny
i
love
merry
suicides
for
a
long
time
we
continued
our
fun
at
the
expense
of
until
his
eminence
calmed
himself
and
assumed
the
tone
of
a
teacher
as
is
the
socialism
of
fools
and
are
you
familiar
i
told
you
we
are
approaching
perfection
so
is
rationalism
the
wisdom
of
fools
the
wise
man
goes
further
the
ratio
constitutes
the
holiday
dress
of
a
fool
it
is
the
coat
he
dons
in
the
presence
of
others
but
he
really
lives
sleeps
works
loves
and
dies
without
any
ratio
at
all
do
you
fear
death
mr
wondergood
i
did
not
feel
like
replying
and
remained
silent
you
need
not
feel
ashamed
wondergood
one
should
fear
death
as
long
as
there
is
the
features
of
the
monkey
face
suddenly
contracted
and
in
his
eyes
there
appeared
horror
and
wrath
as
if
some
one
had
seized
him
by
the
back
of
his
neck
and
thrust
him
into
the
darkness
and
terror
of
a
primeval
forest
he
death
and
his
terror
was
dark
evil
and
boundless
i
needed
no
words
of
explanation
and
no
other
evidence
one
look
upon
this
distorted
befogged
and
confused
face
was
sufficient
to
compel
reverence
for
the
great
irrational
and
how
weak
is
steadiness
my
wondergood
also
grew
pale
and
cringed
ah
the
rogue
he
was
seeking
protection
and
help
from
me
will
you
have
some
wine
your
eminence
but
his
eminence
was
himself
again
he
curved
his
thin
lips
into
a
smile
and
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
and
suddenly
he
broke
out
again
with
surprising
fury
and
as
long
as
there
is
death
the
church
is
unshakable
let
all
of
you
who
seek
to
undermine
her
tear
her
and
blow
her
up
you
can
not
conquer
her
and
even
if
you
should
succeed
in
destroying
her
the
first
to
perish
beneath
her
ruins
would
be
yourselves
who
will
then
defend
you
against
death
who
will
give
you
sweet
faith
in
immortality
in
eternal
life
in
everlasting
bliss
believe
me
wondergood
the
world
is
not
seeking
your
ratio
it
is
all
a
misunderstanding
but
what
does
it
seek
your
eminence
what
does
it
want
vult
you
know
our
latin
the
world
wants
to
be
fooled
and
the
old
monkey
again
grew
merry
begun
to
wink
to
beam
with
satisfaction
slapped
his
knee
and
burst
into
laughter
i
also
laughed
the
rascal
was
so
funny
and
is
it
you
said
i
who
wants
to
fool
it
the
cardinal
again
grew
serious
and
replied
sadly
the
holy
see
needs
funds
wondergood
the
world
while
it
has
not
grown
rational
has
become
weaker
in
its
faith
and
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
manage
it
he
signed
and
continued
you
are
not
a
socialist
wondergood
ah
do
not
be
ashamed
we
are
all
socialists
now
we
are
all
on
the
side
of
the
hungry
the
more
satisfied
they
will
be
the
more
they
will
fear
you
understand
he
flung
out
his
arms
and
drew
them
in
again
like
a
net
filled
with
fish
and
said
we
are
fishermen
wondergood
humble
fishermen
and
tell
me
do
you
regard
the
desire
for
as
a
virtue
or
a
vice
the
entire
civilized
world
regards
the
desire
for
liberty
as
a
virtue
i
replied
angrily
i
expected
no
other
reply
from
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
but
do
you
personally
believe
that
he
who
will
give
man
limitless
will
also
bring
him
alone
releases
all
earthly
ties
and
do
you
regard
the
words
and
as
synonymous
i
speak
of
political
liberty
of
political
liberty
oh
we
have
no
objection
to
that
you
can
have
as
much
as
you
please
of
that
of
course
provided
men
themselves
ask
for
it
are
you
sure
they
really
want
it
if
they
do
please
help
yourself
it
is
all
nonsense
and
calumny
to
say
that
the
holy
see
is
in
favor
of
reaction
i
had
the
honor
to
be
present
on
the
balcony
of
the
vatican
when
his
holiness
blessed
the
first
french
aëroplane
that
appeared
over
rome
and
the
next
pope
i
am
sure
will
gladly
bless
the
barricades
the
time
of
galileo
has
passed
wondergood
and
we
all
know
now
that
the
earth
does
move
he
drew
a
circle
in
the
air
with
his
finger
indicating
the
revolution
of
the
earth
i
said
you
must
permit
me
to
think
over
your
proposal
your
eminence
cardinal
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
gently
touched
my
shoulder
with
two
of
his
aristocratic
fingers
oh
i
am
not
hurrying
you
my
good
wondergood
it
was
you
who
were
hurrying
me
i
am
even
convinced
that
you
will
at
first
refuse
me
but
when
after
some
little
experience
you
will
have
realized
the
real
of
man
i
too
love
man
wondergood
to
be
sure
not
so
passionately
and
he
departed
with
the
same
grimaces
bearing
himself
with
dignity
and
dispensing
blessings
all
about
him
i
saw
him
again
through
the
window
at
the
entrance
of
the
palace
while
the
coachman
was
bringing
up
the
carriage
he
was
speaking
into
the
ear
of
one
of
his
abbés
whose
face
resembled
a
black
plate
the
cardinal
countenance
no
longer
reminded
me
of
a
monkey
it
was
rather
the
face
of
a
shaven
hungry
tired
lion
this
able
actor
needed
no
dressing
room
for
his
behind
him
stood
a
tall
lackey
all
dressed
in
black
reminding
one
of
an
english
baronet
whenever
his
eminence
turned
about
in
his
direction
he
would
respectfully
lift
his
faded
silk
hat
following
the
departure
of
his
eminence
i
was
surrounded
by
a
merry
group
of
friends
with
whom
i
had
filled
the
spare
rooms
of
my
palace
for
the
purpose
of
alleviating
my
loneliness
and
ennui
toppi
looked
proud
and
happy
he
was
so
satiated
with
blessings
that
he
fairly
bulged
the
artists
decorators
and
others
whatever
you
call
them
were
greatly
impressed
by
the
cardinal
visit
and
spoke
with
much
glee
of
the
remarkable
expression
of
his
face
and
the
grandeur
of
his
manner
the
pope
himself
but
when
i
remarked
with
the
naïveté
of
a
redskin
that
he
reminded
me
of
a
monkey
the
shrewd
canailes
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
one
of
them
immediately
sketched
a
portrait
of
cardinal
in
a
cage
i
am
not
a
moralist
to
judge
other
people
for
their
petty
sins
they
will
get
what
is
due
them
on
their
judgment
day
and
i
was
much
pleased
by
the
cleverness
of
the
laughing
beasts
they
do
not
appear
to
have
much
faith
in
for
and
if
i
should
rummage
about
among
their
drawings
i
would
probably
find
a
pretty
good
sketch
of
the
ass
wondergood
i
like
that
i
find
relief
in
communion
with
my
little
pleasant
sinners
from
the
babbling
of
the
great
and
disagreeable
saints
whose
hands
are
covered
with
blood
then
toppi
asked
me
and
how
much
does
he
want
he
wants
all
toppi
said
with
determination
do
you
give
him
all
he
promised
to
make
me
a
prelate
but
all
the
same
do
you
give
him
all
one
should
save
his
money
every
day
i
have
unpleasant
experiences
with
toppi
people
are
constantly
foisting
counterfeit
coin
on
him
when
they
first
gave
him
some
he
was
greatly
perturbed
and
was
impressed
with
what
i
said
to
him
you
really
astonish
me
toppi
i
said
it
is
ridiculous
for
an
old
devil
like
you
to
accept
counterfeit
money
from
human
beings
and
allow
yourself
to
be
fooled
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
toppi
i
fear
you
will
make
a
beggar
of
me
now
however
toppi
entangled
in
the
mesh
of
the
counterfeit
and
the
genuine
seeks
to
preserve
both
the
one
and
the
other
he
is
quite
clever
in
money
matters
and
the
cardinal
tried
in
vain
to
bribe
him
toppi
a
prelate
but
the
shaven
monkey
does
really
want
my
three
billions
apparently
the
belly
of
the
holy
see
is
rumbling
with
hunger
i
gazed
long
at
the
well
executed
caricature
of
the
cardinal
and
the
longer
i
gazed
the
less
i
liked
it
no
there
was
something
missing
the
artist
had
sensed
the
ridiculous
pretty
well
but
i
do
not
see
that
fire
of
spite
and
malice
which
is
in
constant
play
beneath
the
gray
ashes
of
terror
the
bestial
and
the
human
is
here
but
it
is
not
molded
into
that
mask
which
now
that
a
long
distance
separates
me
from
the
cardinal
and
i
no
longer
hear
his
heavy
laughter
is
beginning
to
exercise
a
most
disagreeable
influence
over
me
or
is
it
because
the
extraordinary
is
inexpressible
through
pencil
in
reality
he
is
a
cheap
rascal
no
better
than
a
plain
pickpocket
and
told
me
nothing
new
he
is
human
enough
and
wise
enough
to
cultivate
that
contemptuous
laughter
of
his
at
the
expense
of
the
rational
but
he
revealed
to
me
and
do
not
take
offense
at
my
american
rudeness
dear
reader
somewhere
behind
his
broad
shoulders
cringing
with
terror
there
gleamed
also
your
dear
countenance
it
was
like
a
dream
you
understand
it
was
as
if
some
one
were
strangling
you
and
you
in
stifled
voice
cried
to
heaven
murder
police
ah
you
do
not
know
that
which
is
neither
life
nor
death
and
i
know
it
was
that
was
strangling
you
with
his
bony
fingers
but
do
i
know
oh
laugh
at
him
who
is
laughing
at
you
comrade
i
fear
your
turn
is
coming
to
have
some
fun
at
my
expense
do
i
know
i
came
to
you
from
the
innermost
depths
merry
and
serene
blessed
in
the
consciousness
of
my
immortality
and
i
am
already
hesitating
i
am
already
trembling
before
this
shaven
monkey
face
which
dares
to
express
its
own
low
horror
in
such
audaciously
grand
style
ah
i
have
not
even
sold
my
immortality
i
have
simply
crushed
it
in
my
sleep
as
does
a
foolish
mother
her
newborn
babe
it
has
simply
faded
beneath
your
sun
and
rains
it
has
become
a
transparent
cloth
without
design
unfit
to
cover
the
nakedness
of
a
respectable
gentleman
this
reeking
wondergood
swamp
in
which
i
am
submerged
to
my
eyes
envelops
me
with
mire
befogs
my
consciousness
and
stifles
me
with
the
unbearable
odors
of
decay
when
do
you
usually
begin
to
decay
my
friend
on
the
second
the
third
day
or
does
it
depend
upon
the
climate
i
am
already
in
the
process
of
decay
and
i
am
nauseated
by
the
odor
of
my
entrails
or
are
you
so
used
to
the
work
of
the
that
you
take
it
for
the
elevation
of
thought
and
inspiration
my
god
i
forgot
that
i
may
have
some
fair
readers
too
i
most
humbly
beg
your
pardon
worthy
folk
for
this
uncalled
for
discussion
of
odors
i
am
a
most
unpleasant
conversationalist
milady
and
as
a
perfumer
i
am
worse
no
still
worse
i
am
a
disgusting
mixture
of
satan
and
an
american
bear
and
i
know
not
how
to
appreciate
your
good
taste
no
i
am
still
satan
i
still
know
that
i
am
immortal
and
when
my
will
shall
command
me
i
will
strangle
myself
with
my
own
bony
fingers
but
if
i
then
i
shall
distribute
my
wealth
among
the
poor
and
with
you
my
friend
shall
crawl
up
to
the
old
shaven
monkey
i
shall
cling
with
my
american
face
to
his
soft
slipper
emitting
blessings
i
shall
weep
i
shall
rave
with
horror
save
me
from
death
and
the
old
monkey
brushing
the
hair
from
his
face
reclining
comfortably
gleaming
with
a
holy
light
illuminating
all
about
it
and
itself
trembling
with
fear
and
horror
will
hastily
continue
to
fool
the
world
the
world
which
so
loves
to
be
fooled
but
i
am
jesting
i
wish
to
be
serious
now
i
like
cardinal
and
i
shall
permit
him
to
begild
himself
with
my
gold
i
am
weary
i
must
sleep
my
bed
and
wondergood
await
me
i
shall
extinguish
the
light
and
in
the
darkness
i
shall
listen
for
a
moment
to
the
clicking
of
the
counting
machine
within
my
breast
and
then
will
come
the
great
pianist
a
drunken
genius
and
begin
drumming
upon
the
black
keys
of
my
brain
he
knows
everything
and
has
forgotten
everything
this
ingenious
drunkard
and
confuses
the
most
inspiring
landscapes
with
a
swamp
that
is
a
dream
ii
february
rome
villa
orsini
magnus
was
not
at
home
i
was
received
by
maria
a
glorious
peace
has
suddenly
descended
upon
me
in
wondrous
calm
i
breathe
at
this
moment
like
a
schooner
its
sails
lowered
i
doze
in
the
midday
heat
of
the
slumbering
ocean
not
a
stir
not
a
ripple
i
fear
to
move
or
to
open
wide
my
eyes
dazzled
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
i
breathe
silently
and
i
would
not
rouse
the
slightest
wave
upon
the
boundless
smoothness
of
the
sea
and
quietly
i
lay
down
my
pen
february
villa
orsini
thomas
magnus
was
not
at
home
and
to
my
great
surprise
i
was
received
by
maria
i
do
not
suppose
you
would
be
interested
in
how
i
greeted
her
and
what
i
mumbled
in
the
first
few
moments
of
our
meeting
i
can
only
say
that
i
mumbled
and
that
i
felt
a
strong
impulse
to
laugh
i
could
not
lift
my
eyes
to
gaze
upon
maria
until
my
thoughts
cast
off
their
soiled
garb
and
donned
clean
attire
as
you
see
i
did
not
lose
consciousness
altogether
but
in
vain
did
i
take
these
precautions
torture
did
not
follow
maria
gaze
was
clear
and
simple
and
it
contained
neither
searching
penetrating
fire
nor
fatal
forgiveness
it
was
calm
and
clear
like
the
sky
of
the
campagna
and
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
it
penetrated
my
entire
being
she
met
me
in
the
garden
we
sat
down
by
the
gate
from
which
vantage
point
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
campagna
when
you
gaze
at
the
campagna
you
can
not
prattle
nonsense
no
it
was
she
who
gazed
at
the
campagna
and
i
gazed
into
her
eyes
clear
to
the
seventh
sky
where
you
end
the
count
of
your
heavens
we
were
silent
or
if
you
regard
the
following
as
conversation
we
spoke
are
those
mountains
yes
those
are
the
mountains
of
albania
and
there
is
tivoli
she
picked
out
little
white
houses
in
the
distance
and
pointed
them
out
to
me
and
i
felt
a
peculiar
calm
and
joy
in
maria
gaze
the
suspicious
resemblance
of
maria
to
the
madonna
no
longer
troubled
me
how
can
i
possibly
be
troubled
by
the
fact
that
you
resemble
and
came
a
moment
when
a
great
peace
of
mind
descended
upon
i
have
no
words
of
comparison
whereby
to
reveal
to
you
that
great
and
bright
calm
i
am
forever
conjuring
up
before
me
that
accursed
schooner
with
its
lowered
sails
on
which
i
never
really
sailed
for
i
am
afraid
of
seasickness
or
is
it
because
on
this
night
of
my
loneliness
my
road
is
being
illuminated
by
the
of
the
well
yes
i
was
a
schooner
if
you
so
desire
it
and
if
this
is
not
agreeable
to
you
i
was
besides
i
was
you
see
what
nonsense
emerges
out
of
all
this
talk
when
wondergood
begins
to
seek
words
and
comparisons
i
was
so
calm
that
i
even
soon
began
to
gaze
into
maria
eyes
i
simply
them
this
is
deeper
than
mere
gazing
when
necessary
i
shall
find
those
eyes
again
in
the
meantime
i
shall
remain
a
schooner
with
sails
lowered
i
shall
be
and
i
shall
be
only
once
did
a
slight
breeze
stir
my
sails
but
only
for
a
moment
that
was
when
maria
pointed
out
the
tiberian
road
to
me
cutting
the
green
hills
like
a
white
thread
and
asked
whether
i
had
ever
traversed
it
before
yes
occasionally
signorina
i
often
gaze
upon
this
road
and
think
that
it
must
be
extremely
pleasant
to
traverse
it
by
automobile
have
you
a
swift
car
signor
oh
yes
signorina
very
swift
but
those
i
continued
in
gentle
reproach
who
are
themselves
limitless
distances
and
endlessness
are
in
no
need
of
any
movement
maria
and
an
automobile
a
winged
angel
entering
a
trolley
car
for
the
sake
of
speed
a
swallow
riding
on
a
turtle
an
arrow
on
the
humpy
back
of
a
hod
carrier
ah
all
comparisons
lie
why
speak
of
swallows
and
arrows
why
speak
of
any
movement
for
maria
who
embraces
all
distances
but
it
is
only
now
that
i
thought
of
the
trolley
and
the
turtle
at
that
time
i
felt
so
calm
and
peaceful
i
was
deep
in
such
bliss
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
that
countenance
of
eternity
and
undying
light
a
great
calm
came
upon
me
on
that
day
and
nothing
could
disturb
my
endless
bliss
it
was
not
long
before
thomas
magnus
returned
and
a
flying
fish
gleaming
for
a
moment
above
the
ocean
could
no
more
disturb
its
blue
smoothness
than
did
magnus
disturb
me
i
him
into
my
heart
i
swallowed
him
calmly
and
felt
no
heavier
burden
in
my
stomach
than
a
whale
does
after
swallowing
a
herring
it
was
gratifying
to
find
magnus
hospitable
and
merry
he
pressed
my
hand
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
kind
even
his
face
seemed
less
pale
and
not
as
weary
as
usual
i
was
invited
to
breakfast
lest
it
worry
you
let
me
say
right
now
that
i
remained
until
late
in
the
evening
when
maria
had
retired
i
told
magnus
of
the
visit
of
cardinal
x
his
merry
face
darkened
slightly
and
in
his
eyes
appeared
his
former
hostile
flame
cardinal
he
to
see
you
i
narrated
to
him
in
detail
my
conversation
with
the
shaven
monkey
and
remarked
that
he
had
impressed
me
as
a
scoundrel
of
no
small
caliber
magnus
frowned
and
said
sternly
you
laugh
in
vain
wondergood
i
have
long
known
cardinal
x
and
i
have
been
keeping
a
close
eye
on
him
he
is
evil
cruel
and
dangerous
despite
his
ridiculous
exterior
he
is
as
cunning
merciless
and
revengeful
as
satan
and
you
too
magnus
like
satan
this
shaven
this
caressing
gorilla
this
monkey
cavorting
before
a
but
i
have
exhausted
my
capacity
for
insult
remark
fell
like
a
stone
to
the
bottom
of
my
bliss
i
listened
further
his
flirting
with
the
socialists
his
jokes
at
the
expense
of
galileo
are
all
lies
just
as
the
enemies
of
cromwell
hanged
him
after
his
death
so
would
cardinal
burn
the
bones
of
galileo
with
immense
satisfaction
to
this
day
he
regards
the
movement
of
the
earth
as
a
personal
affront
it
is
an
old
school
wondergood
he
will
stop
at
nothing
to
overcome
obstacles
be
it
poison
or
murder
which
he
will
take
care
to
attribute
to
the
misfortune
of
accident
you
smile
but
i
can
not
discuss
the
vatican
smilingly
not
so
long
as
it
contains
such
and
it
will
always
produce
some
one
like
cardinal
x
look
out
wondergood
you
have
landed
within
the
sphere
of
his
vision
and
interests
and
let
me
assure
you
that
scores
of
eyes
are
now
watching
you
perhaps
me
too
be
on
your
guard
my
friend
magnus
was
quite
excited
fervently
i
shook
his
hand
ah
magnus
but
when
will
you
agree
to
help
me
but
you
know
that
i
do
not
like
human
beings
it
is
who
loves
them
wondergood
not
i
a
gleam
of
irony
appeared
in
his
eyes
the
cardinal
says
that
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
love
people
in
order
to
be
happy
the
contrary
he
says
and
who
told
you
that
i
want
to
make
people
happy
again
it
is
who
wants
to
do
that
not
i
hand
over
your
billions
to
cardinal
x
his
recipe
for
happiness
is
not
worse
than
other
patent
medicines
to
be
sure
his
recipe
has
one
disadvantage
while
dispensing
it
destroys
but
is
that
important
you
are
too
much
of
a
business
man
wondergood
and
i
see
that
you
are
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
world
of
our
inventors
of
the
best
means
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
these
means
are
more
numerous
than
the
best
tonics
for
the
growth
of
hair
i
myself
was
a
dreamer
at
one
time
and
invented
one
or
two
in
my
youth
but
i
was
short
on
chemistry
and
badly
singed
my
hair
in
an
explosion
i
am
very
glad
i
did
not
come
across
your
billions
in
days
i
am
joking
wondergood
but
if
you
wish
to
be
serious
here
is
my
answer
keep
on
growing
and
multiplying
your
hogs
make
four
of
your
three
billions
continue
selling
your
conserves
provided
they
are
not
too
rotten
and
cease
worrying
about
the
happiness
of
mankind
as
long
as
the
world
likes
good
ham
it
will
not
deny
you
its
love
and
admiration
and
how
about
those
who
have
no
means
to
buy
ham
what
do
you
care
about
them
it
is
their
belly
pardon
me
for
the
expression
that
is
rumbling
with
hunger
not
yours
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
new
home
i
know
the
villa
orsini
very
well
it
is
a
magnificent
relic
of
old
rome
i
balked
at
the
prospect
of
another
lecture
on
my
palace
yes
magnus
had
again
shoved
me
aside
he
did
it
brusquely
and
roughly
but
his
voice
lacked
sternness
and
he
gazed
at
me
softly
and
kindly
well
what
of
it
to
the
devil
with
humanity
its
happiness
and
its
ham
i
shall
try
later
to
bore
an
entrance
into
magnus
brain
in
the
meantime
leave
me
alone
with
my
great
peace
and
maria
boundless
peace
and
satan
is
that
a
splendid
touch
in
my
play
and
what
kind
of
a
liar
is
he
who
can
fool
only
others
to
lie
to
oneself
and
believe
it
that
is
an
art
after
breakfast
all
of
us
walked
over
the
downy
hills
and
slopes
of
the
campagna
it
was
still
early
spring
and
only
little
white
flowers
gently
brightened
the
young
green
earth
a
soft
breeze
diffused
the
scents
of
the
season
while
little
houses
gleamed
in
distant
albano
maria
walked
in
front
of
us
stopping
now
and
then
and
casting
her
heavenly
eyes
upon
everything
they
could
envisage
when
i
return
to
rome
i
shall
order
my
to
paint
madonna
thus
on
a
carpet
of
soft
green
and
little
white
flowers
magnus
was
so
frank
and
merry
that
i
again
drew
his
attention
to
maria
resemblance
to
the
madonna
and
told
him
of
the
miserable
in
search
of
a
model
he
laughed
agreed
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
the
aforementioned
resemblance
and
grew
wistful
it
is
a
resemblance
wondergood
you
remember
that
heavy
moment
when
i
spoke
to
you
of
already
there
is
blood
at
the
feet
of
maria
the
blood
of
one
noble
youth
whose
memory
maria
and
i
cherish
there
are
fatal
faces
there
are
fatal
which
confuse
our
souls
and
lead
to
the
abyss
of
self
destruction
i
am
the
father
of
maria
and
yet
i
myself
hardly
dare
to
touch
her
brow
with
my
lips
what
insurmountable
barriers
does
love
raise
for
itself
when
it
dares
to
lift
its
eyes
upon
maria
this
was
the
only
moment
of
that
happy
day
when
my
ocean
became
overcast
with
heavy
clouds
as
tangled
as
the
beard
of
mad
king
lear
while
a
wild
wind
shook
the
sails
of
my
schooner
but
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
maria
i
met
her
gaze
it
was
bright
and
calm
like
the
sky
above
us
and
the
wild
wind
disappeared
without
trace
bearing
away
with
it
fragments
of
the
darkness
i
do
not
know
whether
you
understand
these
sea
comparisons
which
i
consider
quite
inadequate
let
me
explain
i
again
grew
quite
calm
what
is
that
noble
roman
youth
to
me
who
himself
unable
to
find
was
hurled
over
the
head
of
his
pegasus
i
am
a
schooner
and
beneath
me
is
an
entire
ocean
and
was
it
not
written
of
her
the
the
day
was
long
and
quiet
and
i
was
charmed
with
the
precision
with
which
the
sun
rolled
down
from
its
height
to
the
rim
of
the
earth
with
the
measured
pace
with
which
the
stars
covered
the
heavens
the
large
stars
first
then
the
little
ones
until
the
whole
sky
sparkled
and
gleamed
slowly
grew
the
darkness
then
came
the
rosy
moon
at
first
somewhat
rusty
then
brilliant
and
swam
majestically
over
the
road
made
free
and
warm
by
the
sun
but
more
than
anything
else
did
i
and
magnus
feel
charmed
when
we
sat
in
the
room
and
heard
maria
she
played
the
harp
and
sang
and
listening
to
the
strains
of
the
harp
i
realized
why
man
likes
music
produced
by
taut
strings
i
was
myself
a
taut
string
and
even
when
the
finger
no
longer
touched
me
the
sound
continued
to
vibrate
and
died
so
slowly
that
i
can
still
hear
it
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
and
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
entire
air
was
filled
with
taut
and
trembling
strings
they
extend
from
star
to
star
scatter
themselves
over
the
earth
and
penetrate
my
heart
like
a
network
of
telephone
wires
through
a
central
station
if
you
want
more
simple
comparisons
and
there
was
i
understood
when
i
heard
voice
no
you
are
simply
an
animal
wondergood
when
i
recall
your
loud
complaints
against
love
and
its
songs
cursed
with
the
curse
of
monotony
is
that
not
your
own
expression
i
feel
like
sending
you
off
to
a
barn
you
are
a
dull
and
dirty
animal
and
i
am
ashamed
that
for
a
whole
hour
i
listened
to
your
silly
bellowing
you
may
hold
words
in
contempt
you
may
curse
your
embraces
but
do
not
touch
love
my
friend
only
through
love
has
it
been
given
to
you
to
obtain
a
glimpse
into
eternity
away
my
friend
leave
satan
to
himself
he
who
in
the
very
blackest
depths
of
man
has
suddenly
come
upon
new
and
unexpected
flames
away
you
must
not
see
the
and
of
satan
the
hour
was
late
the
moon
indicated
midnight
when
i
left
magnus
and
ordered
the
chauffeur
to
drive
by
way
of
the
numentinian
road
i
feared
lest
this
great
calm
might
slip
away
from
me
and
i
wanted
to
overtake
it
in
the
depths
of
the
campagna
but
the
speed
of
the
car
broke
the
silence
and
i
left
my
machine
it
went
to
sleep
at
once
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
over
its
own
shadow
and
looked
like
a
huge
gray
stone
barring
the
road
for
the
last
time
its
lights
gleamed
upon
me
and
it
became
transformed
into
something
invisible
i
was
left
alone
with
my
shadow
we
walked
along
the
white
road
i
and
my
shadow
stopping
occasionally
and
then
again
resuming
our
march
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
along
the
road
and
the
black
shadow
hid
behind
my
back
and
here
a
great
quiet
descended
upon
the
earth
upon
the
world
upon
my
chilled
brow
i
felt
the
cool
touch
of
the
moon
kiss
march
rome
villa
orsini
i
pass
my
days
in
deep
solitude
my
earthly
existence
is
beginning
to
trouble
me
with
every
hour
i
seem
to
what
i
have
left
behind
the
wall
of
things
my
is
weakening
i
can
hardly
see
behind
that
wall
the
shadows
behind
it
scarcely
move
and
i
can
no
longer
distinguish
their
outline
with
every
second
my
sense
of
grows
duller
i
hear
the
quiet
squeak
of
a
mouse
fussing
beneath
the
floor
but
i
am
deaf
to
the
thunders
rolling
above
my
head
the
silence
of
delusion
envelops
me
and
i
desperately
strain
my
ears
to
catch
the
voices
of
frankness
i
left
them
behind
that
impenetrable
wall
with
each
moment
flees
from
me
in
vain
my
words
try
to
overtake
it
they
merely
shoot
by
in
vain
i
seek
to
surround
it
in
the
tight
embraces
of
my
thoughts
and
rivet
it
with
chains
the
prison
disappears
like
air
and
my
embraces
envelop
nothing
but
emptiness
only
yesterday
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
caught
my
prey
i
imprisoned
it
and
fastened
it
to
the
wall
with
a
heavy
chain
but
when
i
came
to
view
it
in
the
morning
i
found
nothing
but
a
shackled
skeleton
the
rusty
chains
dangled
loosely
from
its
neck
while
the
skull
was
nodding
to
me
in
brazen
laughter
you
see
i
am
again
seeking
comparisons
only
to
have
the
escape
me
but
what
can
i
do
when
i
have
left
all
my
weapons
at
and
must
resort
to
your
poor
arsenal
let
god
himself
don
this
human
form
and
he
will
immediately
begin
to
speak
to
you
in
exquisite
french
or
yiddish
and
he
will
be
unable
to
say
than
it
is
possible
to
say
in
exquisite
french
or
yiddish
god
and
i
am
only
satan
a
modest
careless
human
devil
of
course
it
was
careless
of
me
but
when
i
looked
upon
life
from
no
wait
you
and
i
have
just
been
caught
in
a
lie
old
man
when
i
said
from
you
understood
at
once
it
must
have
been
very
far
away
yes
you
may
have
already
determined
perhaps
the
approximate
number
of
miles
have
you
not
at
your
disposal
a
limitless
number
of
zeros
ah
it
is
not
true
my
is
as
close
as
your
and
is
no
further
away
than
very
spot
you
see
what
nonsense
what
a
lie
you
and
i
are
pirouetting
about
cast
away
your
meter
and
your
scales
and
only
listen
as
if
behind
your
back
there
were
no
ticking
of
a
clock
and
in
your
breast
there
were
no
counting
machine
and
so
when
i
looked
upon
your
life
from
it
appeared
to
me
a
great
and
merry
game
of
immortal
fragments
do
you
know
what
a
puppets
show
is
when
one
doll
breaks
its
place
is
taken
by
another
but
the
play
goes
on
the
music
is
not
silenced
the
auditors
continue
to
applaud
and
it
is
all
very
interesting
does
the
spectator
concern
himself
about
the
fate
of
the
fragments
thrust
upon
the
scrap
heap
he
simply
looks
on
in
enjoyment
so
it
was
with
me
too
i
heard
the
beat
of
the
drums
and
watched
the
antics
of
the
clowns
and
i
so
love
immortal
play
that
i
felt
like
becoming
an
actor
myself
ah
i
did
not
know
then
that
it
is
not
a
at
all
and
that
the
scrap
heap
was
terrible
when
one
becomes
a
puppet
himself
and
that
the
broken
fragments
reeked
with
blood
you
deceived
me
my
friend
but
you
are
astonished
you
knit
your
brow
in
contempt
and
ask
who
is
this
satan
who
does
not
such
things
you
are
accustomed
to
respect
the
devil
you
listen
to
the
commonest
dog
as
if
he
were
speaking
ex
cathedra
you
have
surrendered
to
me
your
last
dollar
as
if
i
were
a
professor
of
white
and
black
magic
and
suddenly
i
reveal
myself
an
ignoramus
in
the
most
elementary
matters
i
understand
your
disappointment
i
myself
have
grown
to
respect
mediums
and
cards
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
can
not
perform
a
single
trick
or
kill
a
bedbug
by
simply
casting
my
eye
upon
it
but
even
with
my
finger
but
what
matters
most
to
me
is
truth
yes
i
did
not
know
your
things
apparently
the
blame
for
this
is
for
that
which
separates
us
just
as
you
do
not
know
real
name
and
can
not
pronounce
a
simple
thing
like
that
so
i
did
not
know
my
earthly
shadow
and
only
now
in
great
ecstasy
do
i
begin
to
grasp
the
wealth
that
is
in
you
think
of
it
such
a
simple
matter
as
counting
i
had
to
learn
from
wondergood
i
would
not
even
be
able
to
button
my
attire
if
it
were
not
for
the
experienced
and
dexterous
fingers
of
that
fine
chap
wondergood
now
i
am
human
like
you
the
limited
sensation
of
my
being
i
regard
as
my
and
with
respect
i
now
touch
my
own
nose
when
necessity
arises
it
is
not
merely
a
nose
it
is
an
axiom
i
am
now
myself
a
struggling
doll
in
a
theater
of
marionettes
my
porcelain
head
moves
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
my
hands
move
up
and
down
i
am
merry
i
am
gay
i
am
at
play
i
know
everything
except
whose
hand
it
is
that
pulls
the
string
behind
me
and
in
the
distance
i
can
see
the
scrap
heap
from
which
protrude
two
little
feet
clad
in
ball
slippers
no
this
is
not
the
of
the
that
i
sought
it
no
more
resembles
merriment
than
do
the
convulsions
of
an
epileptic
a
good
negro
dance
here
any
one
is
what
he
is
and
here
every
one
seeks
not
to
be
what
he
is
and
it
is
this
endless
process
of
fraud
that
i
mistook
for
a
merry
theater
what
a
mistake
how
silly
it
was
of
almighty
immortal
satan
here
every
one
is
dragging
every
one
else
to
court
the
living
are
dragging
the
dead
the
dead
the
living
the
history
of
the
former
is
the
history
of
the
latter
and
god
too
is
history
and
this
endless
nonsense
this
dirty
stream
of
false
witnesses
of
perjurers
of
false
judges
and
false
scoundrels
i
mistook
for
the
of
immortals
or
have
i
landed
in
the
place
tell
me
stranger
whither
does
road
lead
you
are
pale
your
trembling
finger
points
in
the
direction
of
ah
the
scrap
heap
yesterday
i
questioned
toppi
about
his
former
life
the
first
time
he
donned
the
human
form
i
wanted
to
know
how
a
doll
feels
when
its
head
is
cracking
and
the
thread
which
moves
it
is
severed
we
lit
our
pipes
and
with
steins
of
beer
before
us
like
two
good
germans
we
ventured
into
the
realm
of
philosophy
it
developed
however
that
this
numbskull
has
everything
and
my
questions
only
confused
him
is
it
possible
that
you
have
really
forgotten
everything
toppi
wait
till
you
die
and
you
will
learn
all
about
it
yourself
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
it
what
good
is
it
then
it
is
not
good
and
have
you
ever
heard
of
any
one
praising
it
quite
true
no
one
has
yet
showered
praises
upon
it
and
no
one
will
i
know
we
sat
silent
and
do
you
remember
toppi
whence
you
have
come
from
illinois
the
same
place
you
come
from
no
i
am
speaking
of
do
you
remember
whence
you
came
do
you
recollect
your
real
name
toppi
looked
at
me
strangely
paled
slightly
and
proceeded
to
clean
his
pipe
then
he
arose
and
without
lifting
his
eyes
said
i
beg
you
not
to
speak
to
me
wondergood
i
am
an
honest
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
i
do
not
understand
your
insinuations
but
he
remembers
not
in
vain
did
he
grow
pale
he
is
seeking
to
forget
and
will
forget
soon
enough
this
double
play
of
earth
and
heaven
is
too
much
for
him
and
he
has
surrendered
entirely
to
the
earth
there
will
come
a
time
when
he
will
take
me
off
to
an
insane
asylum
or
betray
me
to
cardinal
if
i
dare
to
speak
to
him
of
satan
i
respect
you
toppi
you
are
quite
a
man
i
said
and
kissed
his
brow
i
always
kiss
the
brow
of
people
i
love
again
i
departed
for
the
green
campagna
desert
i
follow
the
best
models
when
i
am
ill
at
ease
i
go
into
the
desert
there
i
called
for
satan
and
cursed
his
name
but
he
would
not
answer
me
i
lay
there
long
in
the
dust
pleading
when
from
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
desert
i
heard
the
muffled
tread
of
feet
and
a
bright
light
helped
me
to
arise
and
again
i
saw
the
eden
i
had
left
behind
its
green
tents
and
unfading
sunrise
its
quiet
lights
upon
the
placid
waters
and
again
i
the
silent
murmurs
of
lips
born
of
immaculate
conception
while
toward
my
eyes
i
saw
approaching
truth
and
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
her
and
pleaded
give
me
back
my
liberty
who
called
maria
satan
again
departed
the
lights
upon
the
placid
waters
were
extinguished
and
truth
frightened
disappeared
and
again
i
sit
upon
the
earth
wearing
my
human
form
and
gazing
dully
upon
the
painted
world
and
on
my
knees
rested
my
shackled
hands
maria
it
is
painful
for
me
to
admit
that
all
this
is
really
an
invention
the
coming
of
satan
with
his
light
and
ringing
step
the
gardens
of
eden
and
my
shackled
hands
but
i
needed
your
attention
and
i
could
not
get
it
without
these
gardens
of
eden
and
these
chains
the
two
extremes
of
your
life
the
gardens
of
eden
how
beautiful
chains
how
terrible
moreover
all
this
talk
is
much
more
entertaining
than
merely
squatting
on
a
hill
cigar
in
one
hand
thinking
lazily
and
yawning
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
chauffeur
and
as
far
as
is
concerned
i
brought
her
into
the
situation
because
from
afar
i
could
see
the
black
cypress
trees
above
the
magnus
home
an
involuntary
association
of
ideas
you
understand
can
a
man
with
such
sight
really
see
satan
can
a
person
of
such
dull
hear
the
murmurs
born
of
immaculate
conception
nonsense
and
please
i
beg
of
you
call
me
just
wondergood
call
me
just
wondergood
until
the
day
when
i
crack
my
skull
open
with
that
plaything
which
opens
the
door
into
space
call
me
just
henry
wondergood
of
illinois
you
will
find
that
i
will
respond
promptly
and
obligingly
but
if
some
day
you
should
find
my
head
crushed
examine
carefully
its
there
in
red
ink
will
be
engraved
the
proud
name
of
satan
bend
thy
head
in
reverence
and
bow
to
him
but
do
not
do
me
the
honor
of
accompanying
my
fragments
to
the
scrap
heap
one
should
never
bow
so
respectfully
to
chains
cast
off
march
rome
villa
orsini
last
night
i
had
an
important
conversation
with
thomas
magnus
when
maria
had
retired
i
began
as
usual
to
prepare
to
return
home
but
magnus
detained
me
why
go
wondergood
stay
here
for
the
night
stay
here
and
listen
to
the
barking
of
mars
for
several
days
dense
clouds
had
been
gathering
over
rome
and
a
heavy
rain
had
been
beating
down
upon
its
walls
and
ruins
this
morning
i
read
in
a
newspaper
a
very
portentous
weather
bulletin
nuvolo
il
vento
forte
e
mare
molto
toward
evening
the
threat
turned
into
a
storm
and
the
enraged
sea
hurled
across
a
range
of
ninety
miles
its
moist
odors
upon
the
walls
of
rome
and
the
real
roman
sea
the
billowy
campagna
sang
forth
with
all
the
voices
of
the
tempest
like
the
ocean
and
at
moments
it
seemed
that
its
immovable
hills
its
ancient
waves
long
evaporated
by
the
sun
had
once
more
come
to
life
and
moved
forward
upon
the
city
walls
mad
mars
this
creator
of
terror
and
tempest
flew
like
an
arrow
across
its
wide
spaces
crushed
the
head
of
every
blade
of
grass
to
the
ground
sighed
and
panted
and
hurled
heavy
gusts
of
wind
into
the
whining
cypress
trees
occasionally
he
would
seize
and
hurl
the
nearest
objects
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
the
brick
roofs
of
the
houses
shook
beneath
his
blows
and
their
stone
walls
roared
as
if
inside
the
very
stones
the
imprisoned
wind
was
gasping
and
seeking
an
escape
we
listened
to
the
storm
all
evening
maria
was
calm
but
magnus
was
visibly
nervous
constantly
rubbed
his
white
hands
and
listened
intently
to
the
antics
of
the
wind
to
its
murderous
whistle
its
roar
and
its
signs
its
laughter
and
its
groans
the
artist
was
cunning
enough
to
be
slayer
and
victim
to
strangle
and
to
plead
for
mercy
at
one
and
the
same
time
if
magnus
had
the
moving
ears
of
an
animal
they
would
have
remained
immovable
his
thin
nose
trembled
his
dim
eyes
grew
dark
as
if
they
reflected
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
his
thin
lips
were
twisted
into
a
quick
and
strange
smile
i
too
was
quite
excited
it
was
the
first
time
since
i
became
human
i
had
heard
such
a
storm
and
it
raised
in
me
a
white
terror
almost
with
the
horror
of
a
child
i
avoided
the
windows
beyond
which
lay
the
night
why
does
it
not
come
here
i
thought
can
the
window
pane
possibly
keep
it
out
if
it
should
wish
to
break
through
some
one
knocked
at
the
iron
gates
several
times
the
gates
at
which
i
and
toppi
once
knocked
for
admission
that
is
my
chauffeur
who
has
come
to
fetch
me
said
i
we
must
admit
him
magnus
glanced
at
me
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
remarked
sadly
there
is
no
road
on
that
side
of
the
house
there
is
nothing
but
field
there
that
is
mad
mars
who
is
begging
for
admittance
and
as
if
he
had
actually
heard
his
words
mars
broke
out
into
laughter
and
disappeared
whistling
but
the
knocking
was
soon
resumed
it
seemed
as
if
some
one
were
tearing
off
the
iron
gates
and
several
voices
shouting
and
interrupting
each
other
were
anxiously
speaking
an
infant
was
heard
weeping
those
must
be
people
who
have
lost
their
way
you
hear
an
infant
we
must
open
the
gates
well
we
see
said
magnus
angrily
i
will
go
with
you
magnus
sit
still
wondergood
this
friend
of
mine
here
is
quite
enough
he
quickly
drew
revolver
from
the
table
drawer
and
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
love
and
even
gentleness
he
grasped
it
in
his
broad
hand
and
carefully
hid
it
in
his
pocket
he
walked
out
and
we
could
hear
the
cry
that
met
him
at
the
gate
on
that
evening
i
somehow
avoided
maria
eyes
and
i
felt
quite
ill
at
ease
when
we
were
left
alone
and
suddenly
i
felt
like
sinking
to
the
floor
and
kneeling
before
her
so
that
her
dress
might
touch
my
face
i
felt
as
if
i
had
hair
on
my
back
that
sparks
would
at
any
moment
begin
to
fly
if
some
one
were
to
touch
it
and
that
this
would
relieve
me
thus
in
my
mind
i
moved
closer
and
closer
to
her
when
magnus
returned
and
silently
put
the
revolver
back
into
the
drawer
the
voices
at
the
door
had
ceased
and
the
knocking
too
who
was
that
asked
maria
magnus
angrily
shook
off
the
drops
of
rain
upon
his
coat
crazy
mars
who
else
did
you
expect
but
i
thought
i
heard
you
speak
to
him
i
jested
trying
to
conceal
the
shiver
produced
by
the
cold
brought
in
by
magnus
yes
i
told
him
it
was
not
polite
to
drag
about
with
him
such
suspicious
company
he
excused
himself
and
said
he
would
come
no
more
magnus
laughed
and
added
i
am
convinced
that
all
the
murderers
of
rome
and
the
campagna
are
threatening
to
ambush
people
and
hugging
their
stilettos
as
if
they
were
their
sweethearts
again
came
a
muffled
and
timid
knock
again
cried
magnus
angrily
as
if
mad
mars
had
really
promised
to
knock
no
more
but
the
knock
was
followed
by
the
ring
of
a
bell
it
was
my
chauffeur
maria
retired
while
i
as
i
have
already
said
had
been
invited
by
magnus
to
remain
overnight
to
which
i
agreed
after
some
hesitation
i
was
not
at
all
taken
by
magnus
and
his
revolver
and
still
less
was
i
attracted
by
the
silly
darkness
the
kind
host
himself
went
out
to
dismiss
the
chauffeur
through
the
window
i
could
see
the
bright
lights
of
the
lanterns
of
the
machine
and
for
a
moment
i
yearned
to
return
home
to
my
pleasant
sinners
who
were
probably
imbibing
their
wine
at
that
moment
in
expectation
of
my
return
ah
i
have
long
since
abandoned
philanthropy
and
am
now
leading
the
life
of
a
drunkard
and
a
gambler
and
again
as
on
that
first
night
the
quiet
little
white
house
this
of
maria
looked
terrible
and
suspicious
this
revolver
these
stains
of
upon
the
white
hands
and
maybe
there
are
more
stains
like
these
here
but
it
was
too
late
to
change
my
mind
the
machine
had
gone
and
magnus
by
the
light
had
not
a
but
a
very
black
and
beautiful
beard
and
his
eyes
were
smiling
pleasantly
in
his
broad
hand
he
carried
not
a
weapon
but
two
bottles
of
wine
and
from
afar
he
shouted
merrily
on
a
night
like
this
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
to
drink
wine
even
mars
when
i
spoke
to
him
looked
drunk
to
me
the
rogue
your
glass
mr
wondergood
but
when
the
glasses
had
been
filled
this
merry
drunkard
hardly
touched
the
wine
and
sitting
deep
in
his
chair
asked
me
to
drink
and
to
talk
without
particular
enthusiasm
listening
to
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
thinking
about
the
length
of
the
night
before
us
i
told
magnus
of
the
new
and
insistent
visits
of
cardinal
x
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
cardinal
had
actually
put
spies
on
my
trail
and
what
is
more
strange
he
has
managed
to
gain
quite
an
influence
over
the
unbribable
toppi
toppi
is
still
the
same
devoted
friend
of
mine
but
he
seems
to
have
grown
sad
goes
to
confessional
every
day
and
is
trying
to
persuade
me
to
accept
catholicism
magnus
listened
calmly
to
my
story
and
with
still
greater
reluctance
i
told
him
of
the
many
unsuccessful
efforts
to
open
my
purse
of
the
endless
petitions
badly
written
in
which
the
truth
appears
to
be
falsehood
because
of
the
boresome
monotony
of
tears
bows
and
naïve
flattery
of
crazy
inventors
of
all
sorts
of
people
with
hasty
projects
gentlemen
who
seek
to
utilize
as
quickly
as
possible
their
temporary
absence
from
jail
of
all
this
hungry
mass
of
humanity
aroused
by
the
smell
of
protected
billions
my
secretaries
there
are
six
of
them
now
hardly
manage
to
handle
all
this
mess
of
tears
on
paper
and
the
madly
babbling
fools
who
fill
the
doors
of
my
palace
i
fear
that
i
will
have
to
build
me
an
underground
exit
they
are
watching
me
even
at
nights
they
are
aiming
at
me
with
picks
and
shovels
as
if
they
were
in
the
klondike
the
nonsense
published
by
these
accursed
newspapers
about
the
billions
i
am
ready
to
give
away
to
every
fool
displaying
a
wound
in
his
leg
or
an
empty
pocket
has
driven
them
out
of
their
senses
i
believe
that
some
night
they
will
divide
me
into
portions
and
eat
me
they
are
organizing
regular
pilgrimages
to
my
palace
and
come
with
huge
bags
my
ladies
who
regard
me
as
their
property
have
found
for
me
a
little
dante
inferno
where
we
take
daily
walks
in
company
with
the
society
that
storms
my
place
yesterday
we
examined
an
old
witch
whose
entire
worth
consists
in
the
fact
that
she
has
outlived
her
husband
her
children
and
her
grandchildren
and
is
now
in
need
of
snuff
and
some
angry
old
man
refused
to
be
consoled
and
even
would
not
take
any
money
until
all
of
us
had
smelled
the
old
putrid
wound
in
his
foot
it
was
indeed
a
horrible
odor
this
cross
old
fellow
is
the
pride
of
my
ladies
and
like
all
favorites
he
is
capricious
and
temperamental
and
are
you
tired
of
listening
to
me
magnus
i
could
tell
you
of
a
whole
flock
of
ragged
fathers
hungry
children
green
and
rotten
like
certain
kinds
of
cheese
of
noble
geniuses
who
despise
me
like
a
negro
of
clever
drunkards
with
merry
red
noses
my
ladies
are
not
very
keen
on
drunkards
but
i
love
them
better
than
any
other
kind
of
goods
and
how
do
you
feel
about
it
signor
magnus
magnus
was
silent
i
too
was
tired
of
talking
mad
mars
alone
continued
his
antics
he
was
now
ensconced
upon
the
roof
trying
to
bite
a
hole
in
the
center
and
crushing
the
tiles
as
he
would
a
lump
of
sugar
magnus
broke
the
silence
the
newspapers
seem
to
have
little
to
say
about
you
recently
what
is
the
matter
i
pay
the
interviewers
not
to
write
anything
at
first
i
drove
them
away
but
they
began
interviewing
my
horses
and
now
i
pay
them
for
their
silence
by
the
line
have
you
a
customer
for
my
villa
magnus
i
shall
sell
it
together
with
the
artists
and
the
rest
of
its
paraphernalia
we
again
grew
silent
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
magnus
rose
first
and
then
sat
down
i
followed
and
sat
down
too
in
addition
i
drank
two
more
glasses
of
wine
while
magnus
drank
none
his
nose
is
never
red
suddenly
he
said
with
determination
do
not
drink
any
more
wine
wondergood
oh
very
well
i
want
no
more
wine
is
that
all
magnus
continued
to
question
me
at
long
intervals
his
voice
was
sharp
and
stern
while
mine
was
melodious
i
would
say
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
you
wondergood
quite
possible
thank
you
magnus
there
used
to
be
more
life
in
you
now
you
rarely
jest
you
have
become
very
morose
wondergood
oh
you
have
even
grown
thin
and
your
brow
is
sallow
is
it
true
that
you
get
drunk
every
night
in
the
company
of
your
friends
it
seems
so
that
you
play
cards
squander
your
gold
and
that
recently
some
one
had
been
nearly
murdered
at
your
table
i
fear
that
is
true
i
recollect
that
one
gentleman
actually
tried
to
pierce
another
gentleman
with
his
fork
and
how
do
you
know
all
about
that
he
replied
sternly
and
significantly
toppi
was
here
yesterday
he
wanted
to
see
maria
but
i
myself
received
him
with
all
due
respect
to
you
wondergood
i
must
say
that
your
secretary
is
unusually
stupid
i
acquiesced
coldly
you
are
quite
right
you
should
have
driven
him
out
i
must
say
for
my
part
that
my
last
two
glasses
of
wine
evaporated
from
me
at
the
mention
of
name
and
our
attempted
conversation
was
marked
by
continued
evaporation
of
the
wine
i
drank
like
perfume
out
of
a
bottle
i
have
always
regarded
wine
as
unreliable
matter
we
found
ourselves
again
listening
to
the
storm
and
i
remarked
the
wind
seems
to
be
growing
more
violent
signor
magnus
yes
the
wind
seems
to
be
growing
more
violent
wondergood
but
you
must
admit
that
i
warned
you
beforehand
mr
wondergood
of
what
did
you
warn
me
beforehand
signor
magnus
he
seized
his
knees
with
his
white
hands
and
directed
upon
me
the
gaze
of
a
snake
charmer
ah
he
did
not
know
that
i
myself
had
extracted
my
poisoned
teeth
and
was
quite
harmless
like
a
mummy
in
a
museum
finally
he
realized
that
there
was
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
and
came
straight
to
the
point
i
warned
you
in
regard
to
he
said
slowly
with
peculiar
insinuation
you
remember
that
i
did
not
desire
your
acquaintance
and
expressed
it
plainly
enough
you
have
not
forgotten
i
told
you
about
maria
of
her
fatal
influence
upon
the
soul
but
you
were
bold
and
insistent
and
i
yielded
and
now
you
ask
us
me
and
my
daughter
to
view
the
highly
exhilarating
spectacle
of
a
gentleman
in
the
process
of
disintegration
one
who
asks
nothing
who
reproaches
no
one
but
can
find
no
solace
until
every
one
has
smelled
his
wound
i
do
not
want
to
repeat
your
expression
wondergood
it
has
a
bad
odor
yes
sir
you
have
spoken
quite
frankly
of
your
neighbors
and
i
am
sincerely
glad
you
have
finally
abandoned
this
cheap
play
at
love
and
humanity
you
have
so
many
other
pastimes
i
confess
however
that
i
am
not
at
all
overjoyed
at
your
intention
of
presenting
to
the
of
a
gentleman
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
you
made
a
mistake
in
leaving
america
and
your
canning
business
dealing
with
people
requires
quite
a
different
sort
of
ability
he
laughed
he
was
almost
driving
me
out
this
little
man
and
i
who
write
my
i
in
a
i
listened
to
him
humbly
and
meekly
it
was
divinely
ridiculous
here
is
another
detail
for
those
who
love
the
ridiculous
before
his
tirade
began
my
eyes
and
the
cigar
between
my
teeth
were
quite
bravely
and
nonchalantly
directed
toward
the
ceiling
but
they
changed
their
attitude
before
he
had
finished
to
this
very
moment
i
feel
the
taste
of
that
miserable
dangling
extinguished
cigar
i
was
choking
with
laughter
that
is
i
did
not
yet
know
whether
to
choke
with
laughter
or
with
wrath
or
without
choking
at
all
to
ask
him
for
an
umbrella
and
leave
ah
he
was
at
he
was
on
his
ground
this
angry
black
bearded
man
he
knew
how
to
manage
himself
in
this
situation
and
he
sang
a
not
a
like
the
inseparable
satan
of
eternity
and
wondergood
of
illinois
sir
i
said
with
dignity
there
seems
to
be
a
sad
misunderstanding
here
you
see
before
you
satan
in
you
understand
he
went
out
for
an
evening
stroll
and
was
lost
in
the
forest
in
the
forest
sir
in
the
forest
wo
you
be
good
enough
sir
to
direct
him
to
the
nearest
road
to
eternity
ah
ah
thank
you
i
thought
myself
farewell
of
course
i
really
did
not
say
that
i
was
and
gave
the
floor
to
wondergood
and
this
is
what
that
respectable
gentleman
said
dropping
his
wet
dead
cigar
the
devil
take
it
you
are
quite
right
magnus
thank
you
old
man
yes
you
warned
me
quite
honestly
but
i
preferred
to
play
a
lone
hand
now
i
am
a
bankrupt
and
at
your
mercy
i
shall
have
no
objection
if
you
should
order
the
removal
of
the
of
the
gentleman
i
thought
that
without
waiting
for
a
stretcher
magnus
would
simply
throw
the
sediment
out
of
the
window
but
his
generosity
proved
quite
surprising
he
looked
at
me
with
pity
and
even
stretched
out
his
hand
you
are
suffering
very
much
mr
wondergood
a
question
quite
difficult
to
answer
for
the
celebrated
i
blinked
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
this
appeared
to
satisfy
magnus
and
for
a
few
moments
we
were
both
silent
i
do
not
know
of
what
magnus
was
thinking
i
thought
of
nothing
i
simply
examined
with
great
interest
the
walls
the
ceiling
books
pictures
all
the
furnishings
of
this
human
habitation
i
was
particularly
absorbed
in
the
electric
light
upon
which
i
fixed
my
attention
why
does
burn
and
give
light
i
am
waiting
for
your
answer
mr
wondergood
so
he
was
really
expecting
me
to
reply
very
well
it
very
simple
magnus
you
warned
me
i
admit
toppi
will
pack
my
trunks
and
i
shall
go
back
to
america
to
resume
my
business
and
the
cardinal
what
cardinal
ah
yes
cardinal
and
my
billions
i
remember
but
do
gaze
at
me
in
such
astonishment
magnus
i
am
sick
of
it
what
are
you
sick
of
mr
wondergood
six
secretaries
brainless
old
women
snuff
and
my
dante
inferno
where
they
take
me
for
my
walks
do
look
at
me
so
sternly
magnus
probably
one
could
have
made
better
wine
out
of
my
billions
but
i
managed
to
produce
only
sour
beer
why
did
you
refuse
to
help
me
of
course
you
hate
human
beings
i
forgot
but
you
them
what
shall
i
say
magnus
no
i
am
rather
indifferent
to
them
look
at
me
so
pityingly
by
god
it
is
worth
it
yes
i
am
indifferent
to
them
there
are
there
were
and
there
will
be
so
many
of
them
that
it
is
really
worth
while
so
i
am
to
conclude
that
you
look
not
at
me
but
at
my
packed
trunks
no
i
did
not
lie
not
entirely
you
know
i
wanted
to
do
something
interesting
for
the
sake
of
amusement
and
so
i
let
loose
this
this
emotion
so
it
was
only
i
blinked
again
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
like
this
method
of
reply
to
complex
questions
and
face
of
signor
thomas
magnus
appealed
to
me
too
his
long
oval
face
recompensed
me
slightly
for
my
theatrical
failures
and
maria
i
must
add
that
by
this
time
there
was
a
fresh
cigar
in
my
mouth
you
said
that
in
your
past
there
are
some
dark
pages
what
the
trouble
mr
wondergood
oh
it
was
a
slight
exaggeration
nothing
in
particular
magnus
i
beg
your
pardon
for
disturbing
you
needlessly
but
at
that
time
i
thought
i
should
have
spoken
thus
for
the
sake
of
style
style
yes
and
the
laws
of
contrast
the
present
is
always
brighter
with
a
dark
past
as
a
background
you
understand
but
i
have
already
told
you
magnus
that
my
prank
had
little
result
in
the
place
i
come
from
they
have
quite
a
mistaken
conception
of
the
pleasures
of
the
game
here
i
shall
have
to
disabuse
them
when
i
get
back
for
a
moment
i
was
taken
in
by
the
old
monkey
but
its
method
of
fleecing
people
is
rather
ancient
and
too
certain
like
a
counting
house
i
prefer
an
element
of
risk
fleecing
people
do
we
despise
them
magnus
and
if
the
game
has
failed
let
us
not
at
least
deny
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
speaking
frankly
i
am
very
glad
but
i
am
tired
of
this
prattle
and
with
your
permission
i
will
take
another
glass
of
wine
there
was
not
even
the
resemblance
of
a
smile
on
thomas
magnus
face
i
mention
the
smile
for
the
sake
of
style
we
passed
the
next
half
hour
in
silence
broken
only
by
the
shrieks
and
yells
of
mad
mars
and
the
even
pacing
of
magnus
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
disregarding
me
entirely
he
paced
the
room
with
even
step
eight
steps
forward
eight
steps
backward
apparently
he
must
have
been
in
jail
at
one
time
and
for
quite
a
while
for
he
had
the
knack
of
the
experienced
prisoner
of
creating
distances
out
of
a
few
meters
i
permitted
myself
to
yawn
slightly
and
thus
drew
the
attention
of
my
host
back
to
myself
but
magnus
kept
quiet
for
another
moment
until
the
rang
out
through
the
air
and
well
nigh
hurled
me
out
of
my
seat
but
loves
you
of
course
you
do
not
know
that
i
arose
yes
that
is
the
truth
maria
loves
you
i
did
not
expect
this
misfortune
i
failed
to
kill
you
wondergood
i
should
have
done
that
at
the
very
beginning
and
now
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
you
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
stretched
and
maria
loves
i
once
witnessed
in
philadelphia
an
unsuccessful
electrocution
of
a
prisoner
i
saw
at
la
scala
in
milan
my
colleague
mephisto
and
hopping
all
over
the
stage
when
the
supers
moved
upon
him
with
their
crosses
and
my
silent
reply
to
magnus
was
an
artistic
improvisation
of
both
the
first
and
the
second
trick
ah
at
that
moment
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
imitate
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
that
never
before
had
i
been
permeated
by
so
many
deadly
currents
never
did
i
drink
such
bitter
wine
never
was
my
soul
seized
with
such
uncontrollable
now
i
no
longer
laugh
or
cringe
like
a
cheap
actor
i
am
alone
and
only
my
own
seriousness
can
hear
and
see
me
but
in
that
moment
of
triumph
i
needed
all
my
strength
to
control
my
laughter
so
that
i
might
not
deal
ringing
blows
to
the
face
of
this
stern
and
honest
man
hurling
the
madonna
into
the
embraces
of
the
devil
do
you
really
think
so
no
or
are
you
merely
thinking
of
wondergood
the
american
with
his
goatee
and
wet
cigar
between
his
gold
teeth
hatred
and
contempt
love
and
anguish
wrath
and
laughter
these
filled
to
the
brim
the
cup
presented
to
me
no
still
worse
still
more
bitter
still
more
deadly
what
do
i
care
about
the
deceived
magnus
or
the
stupidity
of
his
eyes
and
brain
but
how
could
the
pure
eyes
of
have
been
deceived
or
am
i
really
such
a
clever
don
juan
that
i
can
turn
the
head
of
an
innocent
and
trusting
girl
by
a
few
simple
silent
meetings
madonna
where
art
thou
or
has
she
discovered
a
resemblance
between
myself
and
one
of
her
saints
like
toppi
but
i
do
not
carry
with
me
a
traveling
prayer
book
madonna
where
art
thou
are
thy
lips
stretching
out
to
mine
madonna
where
art
thou
or
and
yet
i
cringed
like
an
actor
i
sought
to
stifle
in
respectful
mumbling
my
hatred
and
my
contempt
when
this
new
suddenly
filled
me
with
new
confusion
and
such
love
ah
such
love
thought
i
has
immortality
madonna
echoed
the
immortality
of
satan
and
is
it
now
stretching
forth
this
gentle
hand
to
it
from
the
realms
of
eternity
thou
who
art
hast
thou
recognized
a
friend
in
him
who
has
become
thou
who
art
dost
thou
pity
him
who
is
oh
madonna
lay
thy
hand
upon
my
dark
head
that
i
may
recognize
thee
by
thy
touch
but
hear
what
further
transpired
that
night
i
know
not
why
maria
has
fallen
in
love
with
you
that
is
a
secret
of
her
soul
too
much
for
my
understanding
no
i
do
not
know
but
i
bow
to
her
will
as
to
her
frankness
what
are
my
human
eyes
before
her
gaze
mr
wondergood
the
latter
too
was
saying
the
same
thing
a
moment
ago
in
a
fit
of
excitement
continued
magnus
i
said
something
about
murder
and
death
no
wondergood
you
may
rest
secure
forever
the
chosen
one
of
maria
enjoys
complete
immunity
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
is
protected
by
more
than
the
law
her
pure
love
is
his
armor
of
course
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
leave
us
at
once
and
i
believe
in
your
honest
intention
wondergood
to
place
the
ocean
between
us
but
magnus
moved
forward
towards
me
and
shouted
angrily
not
another
word
i
can
not
kill
you
but
if
you
dare
to
mention
the
word
i
he
slowly
dropped
his
uplifted
hand
and
continued
calmly
i
see
that
i
will
have
to
beg
your
pardon
again
for
my
fit
of
passion
but
it
is
better
than
examples
of
which
we
have
had
from
you
do
not
defend
yourself
wondergood
it
is
quite
unnecessary
and
of
marriage
let
speak
it
will
ring
less
insulting
to
maria
than
it
would
from
your
lips
it
is
quite
unthinkable
remember
that
i
am
a
sober
realist
i
see
nothing
but
mere
coincidence
in
resemblance
of
maria
and
i
am
not
at
all
taken
aback
by
the
thought
that
my
daughter
with
all
her
unusual
qualities
may
some
day
become
a
wife
and
mother
my
categorical
opposition
to
this
marriage
was
simply
another
means
of
warning
you
yes
i
am
accustomed
to
look
soberly
upon
things
wondergood
it
is
not
you
who
is
destined
to
be
maria
life
partner
you
do
not
know
me
at
all
and
now
i
am
compelled
to
raise
slightly
the
curtain
behind
which
i
am
hiding
these
many
years
my
idleness
is
merely
rest
i
am
not
at
all
a
peaceful
villager
or
a
book
philosopher
i
am
a
man
of
struggle
i
am
a
warrior
on
the
battlefield
of
life
and
my
maria
will
be
the
gift
only
of
a
hero
if
if
i
should
ever
find
a
hero
i
said
you
may
rest
assured
signor
magnus
that
i
will
not
permit
myself
to
utter
a
single
word
in
regard
to
signorina
maria
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
hero
but
i
should
think
it
permissible
to
ask
of
you
how
am
i
to
reconcile
your
present
remarks
with
your
former
for
man
i
recollect
that
you
spoke
seriously
of
gallows
and
prisons
magnus
laughed
loudly
and
do
you
remember
what
you
said
about
your
for
man
ah
my
dear
wondergood
i
would
be
a
bad
warrior
and
politician
if
my
education
did
not
embrace
the
art
of
lying
a
little
we
were
both
playing
that
all
you
played
better
i
admitted
quite
gloomily
and
you
played
very
badly
my
friend
do
not
be
offended
but
what
am
i
to
do
when
there
suddenly
appears
before
me
a
gentleman
all
loaded
with
gold
like
like
an
ass
continue
and
begins
to
reveal
to
me
his
love
for
humanity
while
his
confidence
in
his
success
is
equal
only
to
the
quantity
of
the
dollars
in
his
pocket
the
main
fault
of
your
play
wondergood
is
that
you
are
too
eager
for
success
and
seek
immediate
results
this
makes
the
spectator
cold
and
less
credulous
to
be
sure
i
really
did
not
think
you
were
merely
acting
the
worst
play
is
better
than
sincere
assininity
and
i
must
again
crave
your
pardon
you
seemed
to
me
just
one
of
those
foolish
yankees
who
really
take
their
own
bombastic
and
contemptible
tirades
seriously
and
you
understand
quite
fully
i
beg
you
to
continue
only
one
phrase
of
yours
something
about
war
and
revolution
purchasable
with
your
billions
seemed
to
me
to
possess
a
modicum
of
interest
but
the
rest
of
the
drivel
proved
that
that
too
was
a
mere
slip
of
the
tongue
an
accidental
excerpt
of
some
one
else
text
your
newspaper
triumphs
your
flippancy
in
serious
matters
remember
cardinal
x
your
cheap
philanthropy
are
of
a
quite
different
tone
no
wondergood
you
are
not
fit
for
serious
drama
and
your
prattling
despite
its
cynicism
made
a
better
impression
than
your
flamboyant
circus
pathos
i
say
frankly
were
it
not
for
i
would
gladly
have
had
a
good
laugh
at
your
expense
and
without
the
slightest
compunction
would
have
raised
the
farewell
cup
just
one
correction
magnus
i
earnestly
desired
that
you
should
take
part
in
what
in
your
play
yes
your
play
lacked
the
and
you
earnestly
desired
to
saddle
me
with
your
poverty
of
spirit
just
as
you
hire
your
artists
to
paint
and
decorate
your
palaces
so
you
wanted
to
hire
my
will
and
my
imagination
my
power
and
my
love
but
your
hatred
for
man
up
to
this
point
magnus
had
maintained
his
tone
of
irony
and
subtle
ridicule
my
remark
however
seemed
to
change
him
entirely
he
grew
pale
his
white
hands
moved
convulsively
over
his
body
as
if
they
were
searching
for
a
weapon
and
his
face
became
threatening
and
even
horrible
as
if
fearing
the
power
of
his
own
voice
he
lowered
it
almost
to
a
whisper
as
if
fearing
that
his
words
would
break
their
leash
and
run
off
at
a
wild
pace
he
tried
desperately
to
hold
them
in
check
and
in
order
hatred
be
silent
sir
or
have
you
no
conscience
at
all
or
any
common
sense
my
contempt
my
hatred
they
were
my
reply
not
to
your
theatrical
but
to
your
sincere
and
dead
indifference
you
were
insulting
as
a
human
being
by
your
indifference
you
were
insulting
life
by
your
indifference
it
was
in
your
voice
it
gleamed
savagely
out
of
your
eyes
and
more
than
once
was
i
seized
by
terror
terror
sir
when
i
pierced
deeper
the
mysterious
emptiness
of
your
pupils
if
your
past
has
no
dark
pages
which
as
you
say
you
merely
added
for
the
sake
of
style
then
there
is
something
worse
than
that
in
it
there
are
pages
in
it
and
i
can
not
read
them
oh
oh
when
i
look
at
your
eternal
cigar
and
see
your
but
handsome
and
energetic
face
when
i
view
your
unassuming
manner
in
which
the
simplicity
of
the
grog
shop
is
elevated
to
the
heights
of
puritanism
i
fully
understand
your
naïve
game
but
i
need
only
meet
the
pupil
of
your
eye
or
its
rim
and
i
am
immediately
hurled
into
a
void
i
am
seized
with
alarm
and
i
no
longer
see
either
your
cigar
or
your
gold
teeth
and
i
am
ready
to
exclaim
who
are
you
that
you
dare
to
bear
yourself
with
such
indifference
the
situation
was
becoming
interesting
loves
me
and
this
creature
is
about
ready
to
utter
my
name
at
any
moment
is
he
the
son
of
my
father
how
could
he
unravel
the
great
mystery
of
my
boundless
indifference
i
tried
so
carefully
to
conceal
it
even
from
you
here
here
shouted
magnus
in
great
excitement
again
there
are
two
little
tears
in
your
eyes
as
i
have
noticed
before
they
are
a
wondergood
there
is
no
source
of
tears
behind
them
they
have
fallen
from
somewhere
above
from
the
clouds
like
dew
rather
laugh
behind
your
laughter
i
see
merely
a
bad
man
but
behind
your
tears
there
are
pages
white
pages
or
has
maria
read
them
without
taking
his
eyes
off
me
as
if
fearing
that
i
might
run
away
magnus
paced
the
room
finally
seating
himself
opposite
me
his
face
grew
dim
and
his
voice
seemed
tired
when
he
said
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
exciting
myself
in
vain
do
not
forget
magnus
that
i
myself
spoke
to
you
of
indifference
he
waved
his
hand
wearily
and
carelessly
yes
you
did
speak
but
there
is
something
else
involved
here
wondergood
there
is
nothing
insulting
in
the
indifference
but
in
the
other
i
sensed
it
immediately
upon
your
appearance
with
your
billions
i
do
not
know
whether
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
but
i
immediately
felt
like
shouting
of
hatred
and
to
demand
gallows
and
blood
the
gallows
is
a
gloomy
thing
but
the
curious
jostling
about
the
gallows
wondergood
are
quite
unbearable
i
do
not
know
what
they
think
of
our
game
here
in
the
you
come
from
but
we
pay
for
it
with
our
lives
and
when
there
suddenly
appears
before
us
some
curious
gentleman
in
a
top
hat
cigar
in
mouth
one
feels
you
understand
like
seizing
him
by
the
back
of
his
neck
and
he
never
stays
to
the
end
of
the
performance
anyway
have
you
too
wondergood
dropped
in
on
us
for
a
brief
visit
with
what
a
long
sigh
i
uttered
the
name
of
and
i
no
longer
played
i
no
longer
lied
when
i
replied
to
this
gloomy
man
yes
i
have
dropped
in
on
you
for
a
brief
visit
signor
magnus
you
have
guessed
right
for
certain
very
valid
reasons
i
can
reveal
nothing
to
you
of
the
pages
of
my
life
the
existence
of
which
behind
my
leather
binding
you
have
likewise
guessed
but
on
one
of
them
was
written
that
was
not
a
top
hat
in
the
hands
of
the
curious
visitor
but
a
revolver
you
understand
i
look
on
as
long
as
it
is
interesting
and
after
that
i
make
my
bow
and
depart
let
me
put
it
clearer
and
simpler
out
of
deference
to
your
realism
in
a
few
days
perhaps
i
depart
for
the
other
world
no
that
is
not
clear
enough
in
a
few
days
or
i
shall
shoot
myself
kill
myself
with
a
revolver
i
at
first
planned
to
aim
at
my
heart
but
have
decided
that
the
brain
would
be
more
reliable
i
have
planned
all
this
long
ago
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
appearance
before
you
and
was
it
not
in
this
of
mine
to
depart
that
you
have
detected
indifference
is
it
true
that
when
one
eye
is
directed
upon
the
world
it
is
hardly
possible
to
maintain
any
particularly
bright
flame
in
the
eye
directed
upon
world
i
refer
to
the
kind
of
flame
i
see
in
your
eyes
o
you
have
wonderful
eyes
signor
magnus
magnus
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
and
maria
permit
me
to
reply
i
prize
signorina
maria
too
highly
not
to
regard
her
for
me
as
a
fatal
mistake
but
you
wanted
that
love
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question
at
first
perhaps
when
i
indulged
in
dreams
for
a
while
but
the
more
i
perceived
this
fatal
resemblance
that
is
mere
resemblance
magnus
hastened
to
assure
me
but
you
must
be
a
child
wondergood
maria
soul
is
lofty
and
beautiful
but
she
is
human
made
of
flesh
and
bone
she
probably
has
her
own
little
sins
too
and
how
about
my
top
hat
magnus
how
about
my
departure
i
need
only
buy
a
seat
to
gaze
upon
maria
and
her
fatal
resemblance
admitting
that
it
is
only
resemblance
but
how
must
i
pay
for
magnus
said
sternly
only
with
your
life
you
see
only
with
my
life
how
then
did
you
expect
me
to
desire
such
love
but
you
have
miscalculated
she
already
loves
you
oh
if
the
signorina
maria
really
loves
me
then
my
can
be
no
obstacle
however
i
do
not
make
myself
clear
i
wanted
to
say
that
my
departure
no
i
had
better
say
nothing
in
short
signor
magnus
would
you
agree
to
have
me
place
my
billions
at
your
disposal
he
looked
at
me
quickly
now
yes
now
when
we
are
no
longer
playing
i
at
love
and
you
at
hatred
now
when
i
am
about
to
disappear
entirely
taking
with
me
the
of
a
gentlemen
let
me
make
it
quite
clear
would
you
like
to
be
my
heir
magnus
frowned
and
looked
at
me
in
anger
apparently
he
took
my
words
for
ridicule
but
i
was
calm
and
serious
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
large
white
hands
were
trembling
slightly
he
turned
away
for
a
moment
and
then
whirling
about
quickly
he
shouted
loudly
no
again
you
want
no
he
stamped
his
foot
and
cried
once
more
no
his
hands
were
trembling
his
breathing
was
heavy
and
irregular
there
followed
a
long
silence
the
wailing
of
the
tempest
the
whistling
and
murmur
of
the
wind
and
again
great
calm
great
dead
all
embracing
peace
descended
upon
me
everything
was
turned
me
i
still
could
hear
the
earthly
demons
of
the
storm
but
voices
sounded
far
away
and
dull
i
saw
before
me
a
and
he
was
strange
and
cold
to
me
like
a
stone
statue
one
after
another
there
floated
by
me
all
the
days
of
my
human
existence
there
was
the
gleam
of
faces
the
weak
sound
of
voices
and
curious
laughter
and
then
again
all
was
silent
i
turned
my
gaze
to
the
other
side
and
there
i
was
met
by
dumbness
it
was
as
if
i
were
immured
between
two
dumb
stone
walls
behind
one
was
human
life
which
i
had
abandoned
and
behind
the
other
in
silence
and
in
darkness
stretched
forth
the
world
of
eternal
and
real
being
its
silence
was
resounding
its
darkness
was
gleaming
eternal
joyous
life
beat
constantly
like
breakers
upon
the
hard
rocks
of
the
impenetrable
wall
but
deaf
was
my
consciousness
and
silent
my
thought
from
beneath
the
weak
legs
of
thought
there
came
and
it
hung
suspended
in
the
void
immovable
paralyzed
for
the
moment
did
i
leave
behind
the
wall
of
my
unconsciousness
thought
made
no
reply
it
was
motionless
empty
and
silent
two
silences
surrounded
me
two
darknesses
enveloped
me
two
walls
were
burying
me
and
behind
one
in
the
pale
movement
of
shadows
passed
their
human
life
while
behind
the
other
in
silence
and
in
darkness
stretched
forth
the
world
of
my
real
eternal
being
whence
shall
i
hear
the
call
whither
can
i
take
a
step
and
at
that
moment
i
suddenly
heard
the
voice
of
a
man
strange
and
distant
it
grew
closer
and
closer
there
was
a
gentle
ring
in
it
it
was
magnus
speaking
with
great
effort
and
concentration
i
tried
to
catch
the
words
and
this
was
what
i
heard
and
would
you
rather
continue
living
wondergood
march
rome
palazzo
orsini
it
is
three
days
now
that
magnus
and
maria
are
living
in
my
palazzo
in
rome
it
is
empty
and
silent
and
really
seems
huge
last
night
worn
by
insomnia
i
wandered
about
its
halls
and
stairways
over
rooms
i
had
never
seen
before
and
their
number
astonished
me
maria
has
expelled
from
it
all
that
was
frivolous
and
impure
and
only
the
saintly
toppi
moves
through
its
emptiness
like
the
pendulum
of
a
church
clock
ah
how
saintly
he
looks
if
not
for
his
broad
back
the
broad
folds
of
his
coat
and
the
odor
of
fur
in
his
head
i
myself
would
take
him
for
one
of
the
saints
who
have
honored
me
with
their
acquaintance
i
rarely
see
my
guests
i
am
turning
my
entire
estate
into
cash
and
magnus
and
toppi
and
all
the
secretaries
are
busy
with
this
work
from
morning
to
night
our
telegraph
is
constantly
buzzing
magnus
has
little
to
say
to
me
he
only
talks
business
maria
it
seems
as
if
i
were
avoiding
her
i
can
see
her
through
my
window
walking
in
the
garden
and
this
is
quite
enough
for
me
for
her
is
here
and
every
atom
of
the
air
is
filled
with
her
breath
and
as
i
have
already
remarked
i
suffer
with
insomnia
as
you
see
my
friend
i
have
remained
among
the
a
dead
hand
could
not
possibly
write
even
the
dead
words
i
am
not
setting
down
let
us
forget
the
past
as
sweethearts
would
who
have
just
settled
their
differences
let
us
be
friends
you
and
i
give
me
your
hand
my
friend
i
vow
by
eternal
salvation
that
never
again
will
i
chase
you
hence
or
laugh
at
you
if
i
have
lost
the
wisdom
of
the
snake
i
have
acquired
the
gentleness
of
the
dove
i
am
rather
sorry
that
i
have
driven
away
my
painters
and
my
interviewers
i
have
no
one
to
inquire
whom
i
with
my
radiant
countenance
i
personally
feel
that
i
remind
one
of
a
powdered
darkey
who
is
afraid
to
rub
the
powder
off
with
his
sleeve
and
thus
reveal
his
black
skin
ah
i
still
have
a
black
skin
yes
i
have
remained
but
i
know
not
yet
how
far
i
shall
succeed
in
keeping
up
this
state
have
you
any
idea
how
hard
are
the
transitions
from
a
nomad
to
a
settled
life
i
was
a
redskin
a
carefree
nomad
who
folds
up
and
casts
off
all
that
is
human
as
he
would
a
tent
now
i
am
laying
a
granite
foundation
for
an
earthly
home
and
i
having
little
faith
am
cold
and
trembling
will
it
be
warm
when
the
white
snow
covers
my
new
home
what
do
you
think
my
friend
is
the
best
heating
system
i
promised
thomas
magnus
that
night
that
i
would
not
kill
myself
we
sealed
this
agreement
with
a
warm
handshake
we
did
not
open
our
veins
nor
seal
the
pact
with
our
blood
we
simply
said
yes
and
that
was
quite
sufficient
as
you
know
only
human
beings
break
agreements
devils
always
keep
them
you
need
only
recall
your
horny
hairy
heroes
and
their
spartan
honesty
fortunately
let
us
call
it
we
had
set
no
date
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
i
would
be
a
poor
king
and
ruler
if
when
building
a
palace
i
did
not
leave
for
myself
a
secret
exit
a
little
door
a
modest
loophole
through
which
wise
kings
disappear
when
their
foolish
subjects
rise
and
break
into
versailles
i
will
not
kill
myself
perhaps
i
shall
wait
quite
a
while
i
will
not
kill
myself
of
the
two
walls
i
have
chosen
the
lower
one
and
i
am
quite
human
now
even
as
you
my
friend
my
earthly
experiment
is
not
very
thrilling
as
yet
but
who
knows
this
human
life
may
unexpectedly
grow
quite
attractive
has
not
toppi
lived
to
grow
gray
and
to
a
peaceful
end
why
should
not
i
traversing
all
the
ages
of
man
like
the
seasons
of
the
year
grow
to
be
a
gray
old
sage
a
wise
guide
and
teacher
the
bearer
of
the
covenant
and
arterio
sclerosis
ah
this
ridiculous
sclerosis
these
ills
of
old
age
it
is
only
now
that
they
begin
to
seem
terrible
to
me
but
can
i
not
get
used
to
them
and
even
grow
to
love
them
every
one
says
it
is
easy
to
get
used
to
life
well
i
too
will
try
to
get
used
to
it
everything
here
is
so
well
ordered
that
after
rain
comes
sunshine
and
dries
him
who
is
wet
if
he
has
not
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
die
everything
here
is
so
well
ordered
that
there
is
not
a
single
disease
for
which
there
is
no
cure
this
is
so
good
one
may
be
ill
all
the
time
provided
there
is
a
drug
store
nearby
at
any
rate
i
have
my
little
door
my
secret
exit
my
narrow
wet
dark
corridor
beyond
which
are
the
stars
and
all
the
breadth
of
my
illimitable
space
my
friend
i
want
to
be
frank
with
you
there
is
a
certain
characteristic
of
insubordination
in
me
and
it
is
that
i
fear
what
is
a
cough
or
a
catarrh
of
the
stomach
but
it
is
possible
that
i
may
suddenly
refuse
to
cough
for
no
reason
at
all
or
for
some
trivial
cause
and
run
off
i
like
you
at
this
moment
i
am
quite
ready
to
conclude
a
long
and
fast
alliance
with
you
but
may
suddenly
gleam
across
your
dear
face
which
no
it
is
quite
impossible
to
do
without
a
little
secret
door
for
him
who
is
so
capricious
and
insubordinate
unfortunately
i
am
proud
too
an
old
and
well
known
vice
of
satan
like
a
fish
struck
in
the
head
i
am
dazed
by
my
human
existence
a
fatal
unconsciousness
is
driving
me
into
your
life
but
of
one
thing
i
am
quite
certain
i
am
of
the
race
of
the
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
the
i
come
from
those
who
transform
their
will
into
laws
conquered
kings
are
taken
into
captivity
but
conquered
kings
never
become
slaves
and
when
i
shall
perceive
above
my
head
the
whip
of
a
dirty
guard
and
my
fettered
hands
are
helpless
to
avert
the
blow
well
shall
i
remain
living
with
welts
upon
my
back
shall
i
bargain
with
my
judges
about
another
blow
of
the
whip
shall
i
kiss
the
hand
of
the
executioner
or
shall
i
send
to
the
druggist
for
an
eye
lotion
no
let
not
magnus
misjudge
me
for
a
little
slip
in
our
agreement
i
will
live
only
as
long
as
i
want
to
live
all
the
blessings
of
the
human
existence
which
he
offered
me
on
that
night
when
satan
was
tempted
by
man
will
not
strike
the
weapon
from
my
hand
in
it
alone
is
the
assurance
of
my
liberty
oh
man
what
are
all
your
kingdoms
and
dukedoms
your
knowledge
and
your
nobility
your
gold
and
your
freedom
beside
this
little
free
movement
of
the
finger
which
in
a
moment
carries
you
up
to
the
throne
of
thrones
yes
i
am
afraid
of
her
the
look
in
her
eye
is
so
clear
and
commanding
the
light
of
her
love
is
so
mighty
enchanting
and
beautiful
that
i
am
all
atremble
and
everything
in
me
is
quivering
and
urging
me
to
immediate
flight
with
hitherto
unknown
happiness
with
veiled
promises
with
singing
dreams
she
tempts
me
shall
i
cry
away
or
shall
i
bend
mine
to
her
will
and
follow
her
where
i
do
not
know
or
are
there
other
worlds
beside
those
i
know
or
have
forgotten
whence
comes
this
motionless
light
behind
my
back
it
is
growing
ever
broader
and
brighter
its
warm
touch
heats
my
soul
so
that
its
polar
ice
crumbles
and
melts
but
i
am
afraid
to
look
back
i
may
see
sodom
on
fire
and
if
i
look
i
may
turn
into
stone
or
is
it
a
new
sun
which
i
have
not
yet
seen
upon
this
earth
that
is
rising
behind
my
back
and
i
like
a
fool
am
fleeing
from
it
and
baring
my
back
instead
of
my
breast
to
it
the
low
dumb
neck
of
a
frightened
animal
instead
of
my
lofty
brow
maria
will
you
give
me
my
revolver
i
paid
ten
dollars
for
it
together
with
the
holster
to
you
i
will
not
give
it
for
a
kingdom
only
do
not
look
at
me
oh
queen
otherwise
otherwise
i
will
give
you
everything
the
revolver
and
the
holster
and
satan
himself
march
rome
palazzo
orsini
it
is
the
fifth
night
that
i
do
not
sleep
when
the
last
light
is
turned
out
in
my
silent
palazzo
i
quietly
descend
the
stairs
quietly
order
a
machine
somehow
or
other
even
the
noise
of
my
own
steps
and
voice
disturb
me
and
i
go
for
the
night
into
the
campagna
there
leaving
the
automobile
on
the
road
i
wander
about
until
or
sit
immovable
upon
some
dark
ruins
i
can
not
be
seen
at
all
and
the
rare
passersby
perhaps
some
peasants
from
albano
converse
quite
loudly
and
without
restraint
i
like
to
remain
unseen
it
reminds
me
of
something
i
have
forgotten
once
as
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
i
disturbed
a
lizzard
it
may
have
been
that
it
lightly
moved
the
grass
beneath
my
feet
and
disappeared
perhaps
it
was
a
snake
i
do
not
know
but
i
wanted
desperately
to
become
a
lizzard
or
a
snake
concealed
beneath
a
stone
i
am
troubled
by
my
large
stature
by
the
size
of
my
feet
and
arms
they
make
it
very
difficult
to
become
invisible
i
likewise
refrain
from
looking
at
my
face
in
the
mirror
it
is
painful
to
think
i
have
a
face
which
all
can
see
why
did
i
fear
darkness
so
much
at
the
beginning
it
is
so
easy
to
conceal
oneself
in
it
apparently
all
animals
experience
such
subtle
shame
fear
and
worriment
and
seek
seclusion
when
they
are
changing
their
skin
or
hide
so
i
am
changing
my
skin
ah
it
is
the
same
worthless
prattle
the
whole
trouble
is
that
i
have
failed
to
escape
gaze
and
am
apparently
preparing
to
close
the
last
door
the
door
i
guarded
so
well
but
i
am
ashamed
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
i
feel
ashamed
like
a
girl
before
the
altar
i
am
almost
blushing
blushing
satan
no
quiet
quiet
is
not
here
quiet
magnus
told
her
everything
she
did
not
reiterate
that
she
loves
me
but
looked
at
me
and
said
promise
you
will
not
kill
yourself
the
was
in
her
gaze
you
remember
how
bright
it
is
but
do
not
think
that
i
hastily
agreed
like
a
salamander
in
the
fire
i
quickly
changed
colors
i
shall
not
repeat
to
you
all
the
flaming
phrases
i
uttered
i
have
forgotten
them
but
you
remember
how
bright
and
serene
maria
gaze
is
i
kissed
her
hand
and
said
humbly
madam
i
do
not
ask
you
for
forty
days
and
a
desert
for
contemplation
the
desert
i
will
find
myself
and
a
week
is
quite
enough
for
me
to
think
the
matter
over
but
do
give
me
a
week
and
please
do
look
at
me
any
more
otherwise
no
that
was
what
i
said
i
said
it
in
other
words
but
it
all
the
same
i
am
now
changing
my
skin
it
hurts
me
i
am
frightened
and
ashamed
because
any
crow
might
see
me
and
come
to
pick
my
flesh
what
use
is
there
in
the
fact
that
there
is
a
revolver
in
my
pocket
it
is
only
when
you
learn
to
hit
yourself
that
you
can
hit
a
crow
crows
know
that
and
consequently
do
not
fear
tragically
bulging
pockets
having
become
human
and
descended
from
above
i
have
become
but
half
a
man
i
entered
upon
this
human
existence
as
if
into
a
strange
element
but
i
have
not
lost
myself
in
it
entirely
i
still
cling
with
one
hand
to
my
heaven
and
my
eyes
are
still
above
the
surface
but
she
commands
me
to
accept
man
in
his
entirety
only
he
is
a
who
has
said
never
shall
i
kill
myself
never
shall
i
leave
life
of
my
own
free
will
and
what
about
the
whip
these
cursed
cuts
upon
my
back
pride
oh
maria
maria
how
terribly
you
tempt
me
i
look
into
the
past
of
this
earth
and
serious
myriads
of
tragic
shadows
floating
slowly
over
climes
and
ages
their
hands
stretch
hopelessly
into
space
their
bony
ribs
tear
through
the
lean
thin
skin
their
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
and
their
sighs
have
dried
up
their
throats
i
see
blood
and
madness
violence
and
falsehood
i
hear
their
oaths
which
they
constantly
betray
their
prayers
to
god
in
which
with
every
word
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
they
curse
their
own
earth
wherever
i
look
i
see
the
earth
smoking
in
convulsion
no
matter
in
which
direction
i
strain
my
ear
i
hear
everywhere
unceasing
moans
or
is
the
womb
of
the
earth
itself
filled
with
moaning
i
see
a
myriad
cups
about
me
but
no
matter
which
of
them
my
lips
may
touch
i
find
it
filled
with
rust
and
vinegar
or
has
man
no
other
drink
and
this
is
i
knew
before
i
have
seen
before
but
i
looked
upon
them
as
augustus
did
from
his
box
upon
the
galaxy
of
his
victims
ave
cæsar
these
who
are
about
to
die
salute
you
and
i
looked
upon
them
with
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
and
my
wise
belaureled
head
did
not
disdain
to
take
notice
of
their
groaning
cries
even
with
so
much
as
a
nod
they
came
and
disappeared
they
marched
on
in
endless
procession
and
endless
was
the
indifference
of
my
gaze
and
now
is
it
really
i
who
walks
on
so
hastily
playing
with
the
sand
of
the
arena
and
am
i
this
dirty
emaciated
hungry
slave
who
lifts
his
convict
face
into
the
air
yelling
hoarsely
into
the
indifferent
eyes
of
fate
ave
cæsar
ave
cæsar
i
feel
a
sharp
whip
upon
my
back
and
with
a
cry
of
pain
i
fall
to
the
ground
is
it
some
who
is
beating
me
no
it
is
another
who
has
been
ordered
to
whip
a
very
soon
his
knout
will
be
in
my
hand
and
his
back
will
be
covered
with
blood
and
he
will
be
chewing
the
sand
the
sand
which
now
grates
between
my
teeth
oh
maria
maria
how
terribly
you
tempt
me
iii
march
rome
buy
the
blackest
paint
available
take
the
largest
brush
you
can
find
and
with
a
broad
line
divide
my
life
into
yesterday
and
take
the
staff
of
moses
and
divide
the
stream
of
time
and
dry
it
up
clear
down
to
its
bed
then
only
will
you
sense
my
cæsar
moriturus
te
salutat
april
rome
pallazzo
orsini
i
do
not
want
to
lie
there
is
not
yet
in
me
oh
man
any
love
for
you
and
if
you
have
hastened
to
open
your
arms
to
me
please
close
them
the
time
has
not
yet
come
for
passionate
embraces
later
at
some
other
date
we
shall
embrace
but
meanwhile
let
us
be
cold
and
restrained
like
two
gentlemen
in
misfortune
i
can
not
say
that
my
respect
for
you
has
grown
to
any
extent
although
your
life
and
your
fate
have
become
my
life
and
my
fate
let
the
facts
suffice
that
i
have
voluntarily
placed
my
neck
beneath
the
yoke
and
that
one
and
the
same
whip
are
furrowing
our
backs
yes
that
is
quite
sufficient
for
the
present
you
have
observed
that
i
no
longer
use
a
in
writing
the
word
i
i
have
thrown
it
out
together
with
the
revolver
this
is
a
sign
of
submission
and
equality
you
understand
like
a
king
i
have
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
your
constitution
but
i
shall
not
like
a
king
betray
this
vow
i
have
preserved
from
my
former
life
a
respect
for
contracts
i
swear
i
will
be
true
to
your
and
will
not
make
any
attempt
to
escape
alone
for
the
last
few
nights
before
i
took
this
decision
i
thought
much
upon
life
it
is
wretched
do
you
think
so
it
is
difficult
and
humiliating
to
be
this
little
thing
called
man
the
cunning
and
avaricious
little
worm
that
crawls
hastily
multiplies
itself
and
lies
turning
away
its
head
from
the
final
blow
the
worm
that
no
matter
how
much
it
lies
will
perish
just
the
same
at
the
appointed
hour
but
i
will
be
a
worm
let
me
too
beget
children
let
the
unthinking
foot
also
crush
my
unthinking
head
at
the
appointed
hour
i
meekly
accept
all
consequences
we
are
both
of
us
humiliated
comrade
and
in
this
alone
there
is
some
consolation
you
will
listen
to
my
complaints
and
i
to
yours
and
if
the
matter
should
ultimately
reach
the
state
of
litigation
why
the
witnesses
will
all
be
ready
that
is
well
when
one
kills
in
the
public
square
there
are
always
eyewitnesses
i
will
lie
if
necessary
i
will
not
lie
in
that
free
play
of
lying
with
which
even
prophets
lie
but
in
that
enforced
manner
of
lying
employed
by
the
rabbit
which
compels
him
to
hide
his
ears
to
be
gray
in
summer
and
white
in
winter
what
can
one
do
when
behind
every
tree
a
hunter
with
a
rifle
is
concealed
this
lying
may
appear
to
be
ignoble
from
one
point
of
view
and
may
well
call
forth
condemnation
upon
us
but
you
and
i
must
live
my
friend
let
accuse
us
to
their
heart
content
but
when
necessary
we
will
lie
like
wolves
too
we
will
spring
forward
suddenly
and
seize
the
enemy
by
the
throat
one
must
live
brother
one
must
live
and
are
we
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
fact
that
there
is
such
great
lure
and
such
fine
taste
in
blood
in
reality
neither
you
nor
i
are
proud
of
our
lying
of
our
cowardice
or
of
our
cruelty
and
our
bloodthirstiness
is
certainly
not
a
matter
of
conviction
but
however
hideous
our
life
may
be
it
is
still
more
miserable
do
you
agree
with
that
i
do
not
love
you
yet
oh
man
but
on
these
nights
i
have
been
more
than
once
on
the
verge
of
tears
when
i
thought
of
your
suffering
of
your
tortured
body
and
of
your
soul
relinquished
to
eternal
crucifixion
it
is
well
for
a
wolf
to
be
a
wolf
it
is
well
for
a
rabbit
to
be
a
rabbit
but
you
man
contain
both
god
and
satan
and
oh
how
terrible
is
the
imprisonment
of
both
in
that
narrow
and
dark
cell
of
yours
can
god
be
a
wolf
tearing
throats
and
drinking
blood
can
satan
be
a
rabbit
hiding
his
ears
behind
his
humped
back
no
that
is
intolerable
i
agree
with
you
that
fills
life
with
eternal
confusion
and
pain
and
the
sorrow
of
the
soul
becomes
boundless
think
of
it
of
three
children
that
you
beget
one
becomes
a
murderer
the
other
the
victim
and
the
third
the
judge
and
executioner
and
each
day
the
murderers
are
murdered
and
still
they
continue
to
be
born
and
each
day
the
murderers
kill
conscience
and
conscience
kills
the
murderers
and
all
are
alive
the
murderers
and
conscience
oh
what
a
fog
we
live
in
give
heed
to
all
the
spoken
by
man
from
the
day
of
his
birth
and
you
will
think
this
is
god
look
at
all
the
of
man
from
his
very
first
day
and
you
will
exclaim
in
disgust
this
is
a
beast
thus
does
man
struggle
with
himself
for
thousands
of
years
and
the
sorrow
of
his
soul
is
boundless
and
the
suffering
of
his
mind
is
terrible
and
horrible
while
the
judge
is
slow
about
his
coming
but
he
will
never
come
i
say
this
to
you
we
are
forever
alone
with
our
life
but
i
accept
this
too
not
yet
has
the
earth
endowed
me
with
my
name
and
i
know
not
who
i
am
cain
or
abel
but
i
accept
the
sacrifice
as
i
do
murder
i
am
everywhere
with
you
and
everywhere
i
follow
you
man
let
us
weep
together
in
the
desert
knowing
that
no
one
will
give
heed
to
us
or
perhaps
some
one
will
you
see
you
and
i
are
beginning
to
have
faith
in
some
one
ear
and
soon
i
will
begin
to
believe
in
a
triangular
eye
it
is
really
impossible
that
such
a
concert
should
have
no
hearer
that
such
a
spectacle
should
be
wasted
on
the
desert
air
i
think
of
the
fact
that
no
one
has
yet
beaten
me
and
i
am
afraid
what
will
become
of
my
soul
when
some
one
grubby
hand
strikes
me
on
the
face
what
will
become
of
me
for
i
know
that
no
earthly
revenge
could
return
my
face
to
me
and
what
will
then
become
of
my
soul
i
swear
i
will
become
reconciled
even
to
this
everywhere
with
you
and
after
you
man
what
is
my
face
when
you
struck
the
face
of
your
own
christ
and
spat
into
his
eyes
everywhere
with
you
and
if
necessary
i
myself
will
strike
at
christ
with
the
hand
with
which
i
now
write
i
go
with
you
to
all
ends
man
they
beat
us
and
they
will
continue
to
beat
us
we
beat
christ
and
will
still
beat
him
ah
bitter
is
our
life
almost
unbearable
only
a
while
ago
i
rejected
your
embraces
i
said
they
were
premature
but
now
i
say
let
us
embrace
more
firmly
brother
let
us
cling
closely
to
each
other
it
is
so
painful
so
terrible
to
be
alone
in
this
life
when
all
exits
from
it
are
closed
and
i
know
not
yet
wherein
there
is
more
pride
and
liberty
in
going
away
voluntarily
whenever
one
wishes
or
in
accepting
without
resistance
the
hand
of
the
executioner
in
calmly
placing
one
hands
upon
his
breast
putting
one
foot
forward
and
with
head
proudly
bent
backward
to
wait
calmly
do
thy
duty
executioner
or
soldiers
here
my
breast
fire
there
is
something
plastic
in
this
pose
and
it
pleases
me
but
still
more
am
i
pleased
with
the
fact
that
once
again
my
greater
ego
is
rising
within
me
at
the
striking
of
this
pose
of
course
the
executioner
will
not
fail
to
do
his
duty
and
the
soldiers
will
not
lower
their
rifles
but
the
important
thing
is
the
line
the
when
before
my
very
death
itself
i
shall
suddenly
find
myself
immortal
and
broader
than
life
itself
it
is
strange
but
with
one
turn
of
the
head
with
one
phrase
expressed
or
conceived
at
the
proper
moment
i
could
so
to
speak
halt
the
function
of
my
very
spirit
and
the
entire
operation
would
be
performed
outside
of
me
and
when
death
shall
have
finally
performed
its
rôle
of
redeemer
its
darkness
would
not
eclipse
the
light
for
the
latter
will
have
first
separated
itself
from
me
and
scattered
into
space
in
order
to
reassemble
somewhere
and
blaze
forth
again
but
where
strange
strange
i
sought
to
escape
from
men
and
found
myself
at
that
wall
of
unconsciousness
known
only
to
satan
how
important
indeed
is
the
pose
i
must
make
note
of
that
but
will
the
pose
be
as
convincing
and
will
it
not
lose
in
plasticity
if
instead
of
death
the
executioner
and
the
firing
squad
i
should
be
compelled
to
say
something
else
well
something
like
here
my
face
strike
i
do
not
know
why
i
am
so
concerned
about
my
face
but
it
does
concern
me
greatly
i
confess
man
that
it
worries
me
very
much
indeed
no
a
mere
trifle
i
will
simply
subdue
my
spirit
let
them
beat
me
when
the
spirit
is
crushed
the
operation
is
no
more
painful
or
humiliating
than
it
would
be
if
i
were
to
beat
my
overcoat
on
its
hanger
but
i
have
forgotten
that
i
am
not
alone
and
being
in
your
company
have
fallen
into
impolite
meditation
for
a
half
hour
i
have
been
silent
over
this
sheet
of
paper
and
it
seemed
all
the
time
as
if
i
had
been
talking
and
quite
excitedly
i
forgot
that
it
is
not
enough
to
think
that
one
must
also
speak
what
a
shame
it
is
man
that
for
the
exchange
of
thoughts
we
must
resort
to
the
service
of
such
a
poor
and
stealthy
broker
as
the
word
he
steals
all
that
is
precious
and
defiles
the
best
thoughts
with
the
chatter
of
the
market
place
in
truth
this
pains
me
much
more
than
death
or
the
beating
i
am
terrified
by
the
necessity
of
when
i
come
upon
the
which
is
inexpressible
like
a
rivulet
i
run
and
advance
only
as
far
as
the
ocean
in
the
depths
of
the
latter
is
the
end
of
my
murmuring
within
me
however
motionless
and
omnipresent
rocking
to
and
fro
is
the
ocean
it
only
hurls
noise
and
surf
upon
the
earth
but
its
depths
are
dumb
and
motionless
and
quite
without
any
purpose
are
the
ships
sailing
on
its
surface
how
shall
i
describe
it
before
i
resolved
to
enroll
myself
as
an
earthly
slave
i
did
not
speak
to
maria
or
to
magnus
why
should
i
speak
to
maria
when
her
beckoning
is
like
her
gaze
but
having
become
a
slave
i
went
to
magnus
to
complain
and
to
seek
advice
apparently
the
human
begins
thus
magnus
heard
me
in
silence
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
some
inner
excitement
he
works
day
and
night
virtually
knowing
no
rest
and
the
complicated
business
of
the
liquidation
of
my
property
is
moving
forward
as
rapidly
in
his
hands
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
in
such
work
all
his
life
i
like
his
heroic
gestures
and
his
contempt
for
details
when
he
can
not
unravel
a
situation
he
hurls
millions
out
of
the
window
with
the
grace
of
a
grandee
but
he
is
weary
and
his
eyes
seem
larger
and
darker
on
the
background
of
his
dim
face
only
now
have
i
learned
from
maria
that
he
is
tortured
by
frequent
headaches
my
complaints
against
life
i
fear
have
failed
to
arouse
any
particular
sympathy
on
his
part
no
matter
what
the
accusations
i
brought
against
man
and
the
life
he
leads
magnus
would
reply
impatiently
yes
yes
wondergood
that
is
what
being
a
man
means
your
misfortune
is
that
you
discovered
this
rather
late
and
are
now
quite
unnecessarily
aroused
when
you
shall
have
at
least
a
part
of
that
which
now
terrifies
you
you
will
speak
in
quite
a
different
tone
however
i
am
glad
that
you
have
dropped
your
you
have
become
much
more
nervous
and
energetic
but
whence
comes
this
immeasurable
terror
in
your
eyes
collect
yourself
wondergood
i
laughed
thank
you
i
am
quite
collected
apparently
it
is
the
in
expectation
of
the
whip
who
peers
at
you
from
within
my
eye
have
patience
magnus
i
am
not
quite
acclimated
to
the
situation
tell
me
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
be
compelled
to
commit
murder
quite
possibly
and
can
you
tell
me
this
happens
both
of
us
looked
simultaneously
at
his
white
hands
and
magnus
replied
somewhat
ironically
no
i
will
not
tell
you
that
but
if
you
wish
i
will
tell
you
something
else
i
will
tell
you
what
it
means
to
accept
man
to
the
it
is
this
that
is
really
worrying
you
is
it
not
and
with
much
coolness
and
a
sort
of
secret
impatience
as
if
another
thought
were
devouring
his
attention
he
told
me
briefly
of
a
certain
unwilling
and
terrible
murderer
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
telling
me
a
fact
or
a
dark
tale
created
for
my
personal
benefit
but
this
was
the
story
it
happened
long
ago
a
certain
russian
a
political
exile
a
man
of
wide
education
yet
deeply
religious
as
often
happens
in
russia
escaped
from
and
after
long
and
painful
wandering
over
the
siberian
forests
he
found
refuge
with
some
sectarians
huge
wooden
fresh
huts
in
a
thick
forest
surrounded
by
tall
fences
great
bearded
people
large
ugly
dogs
something
on
that
order
and
in
his
very
presence
soon
after
his
arrival
there
was
to
be
performed
a
monstrous
crime
these
insane
mystics
under
the
influence
of
some
wild
religious
fanaticism
were
to
sacrifice
an
innocent
upon
a
altar
to
the
accompaniment
of
hymns
they
were
to
kill
a
child
magnus
did
not
relate
all
the
painful
details
limiting
himself
solely
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
seven
year
old
boy
in
a
new
shirt
and
that
his
young
mother
witnessed
the
ceremony
all
the
reasonable
arguments
all
the
objections
of
the
exile
that
they
were
about
to
perform
a
great
sacrilege
that
not
the
mercy
of
the
lord
awaited
them
but
the
terrible
tortures
of
hell
proved
powerless
to
overcome
the
fierce
and
dull
stubbornness
of
the
fanatics
he
fell
upon
his
knees
begged
wept
and
tried
to
seize
the
knife
at
that
moment
the
victim
stripped
was
already
on
the
table
while
the
was
trying
desperately
to
control
her
tears
and
cries
but
he
only
succeeded
in
rousing
the
mad
anger
of
the
fanatics
they
threatened
to
kill
him
too
magnus
looked
at
me
and
said
slowly
with
a
peculiar
calm
and
how
would
you
have
acted
in
that
case
mr
wondergood
well
i
would
have
fought
until
i
was
killed
yes
he
did
better
he
offered
his
services
and
with
his
hand
with
appropriate
song
he
cut
the
boy
throat
you
are
astonished
but
he
said
for
me
to
take
this
terrible
sin
and
punishment
upon
myself
than
to
surrender
into
the
arms
of
hell
these
innocent
fools
of
course
such
things
happen
only
with
russians
and
it
seems
to
me
he
himself
was
somewhat
deranged
he
died
eventually
in
an
insane
asylum
following
a
period
of
silence
i
asked
and
how
would
you
have
acted
magnus
and
with
still
greater
coolness
he
replied
really
i
do
not
know
it
would
have
depended
on
the
moment
it
is
quite
possible
i
would
have
left
those
beasts
but
it
is
also
possible
that
i
too
human
madness
is
extremely
contagious
mr
wondergood
do
you
call
it
only
madness
i
said
human
madness
but
it
is
you
who
are
concerned
in
this
wondergood
do
you
like
it
i
am
off
to
work
in
the
meantime
devote
yourself
to
discerning
the
of
the
human
which
you
are
now
willing
to
accept
in
its
entirety
and
then
tell
me
about
it
you
have
not
changed
your
intention
i
hope
of
remaining
with
he
laughed
and
went
away
patronizingly
polite
and
i
remained
to
think
and
so
i
think
where
is
the
boundary
i
confess
that
i
have
begun
to
fear
magnus
somewhat
or
is
this
fear
one
of
the
gifts
of
my
complete
human
existence
but
when
he
speaks
to
me
in
this
fashion
i
become
animated
with
a
strange
confusion
my
eyes
move
timidly
my
will
is
bent
as
if
too
great
and
strange
a
load
had
been
put
upon
it
think
man
i
shake
his
big
hand
with
and
find
in
his
caress
this
is
not
true
of
me
before
but
now
in
every
conversation
i
perceive
that
this
man
can
go
than
i
in
everything
i
fear
i
him
if
i
have
not
yet
experienced
love
i
know
not
hatred
either
and
it
will
be
strange
indeed
if
i
should
be
compelled
to
begin
by
hating
the
of
maria
in
what
a
fog
we
do
live
man
i
have
just
merely
mentioned
the
name
of
maria
her
clear
gaze
has
only
touched
my
soul
and
already
my
hatred
of
magnus
is
extinguished
or
did
i
only
conjure
it
up
and
extinguished
also
is
my
fear
of
man
and
life
or
did
i
merely
invent
it
and
great
joy
great
peace
has
descended
upon
me
it
is
as
if
i
were
again
a
white
schooner
on
the
glassy
ocean
as
if
i
held
all
answers
in
my
hand
and
were
merely
too
lazy
to
open
it
and
read
therein
as
if
had
returned
to
me
ah
i
can
speak
no
more
oh
man
let
me
press
your
hand
april
the
good
toppi
approves
my
actions
he
amuses
me
greatly
this
good
toppi
as
i
expected
he
has
forgotten
his
true
origin
he
regards
all
my
reminders
of
our
past
as
jests
sometimes
he
laughs
but
more
often
he
frowns
as
if
he
were
hurt
for
he
is
religious
and
considers
it
an
insult
to
be
compared
with
a
horny
devil
even
in
jest
he
himself
is
now
convinced
that
devils
have
horns
his
americanism
at
first
pale
and
weak
like
a
pencil
sketch
has
now
become
filled
with
color
and
i
myself
am
ready
to
believe
all
the
nonsense
given
out
by
toppi
as
his
life
it
is
so
sincere
and
convincing
according
to
he
has
been
in
my
service
about
fifteen
years
and
particularly
amusing
it
is
to
hear
his
stories
of
his
youth
apparently
he
too
has
been
touched
by
the
charms
of
my
decision
to
surrender
all
my
money
to
her
father
astonished
him
much
less
than
i
expected
he
merely
chewed
his
cigar
for
a
moment
and
asked
and
what
will
he
do
with
your
money
i
do
not
know
toppi
he
raised
his
brow
and
frowned
you
are
joking
mr
wondergood
you
see
toppi
just
now
we
magnus
is
occupied
in
converting
my
estate
into
gold
and
jamming
it
into
banks
in
his
name
of
course
you
understand
how
can
i
fail
to
understand
mr
wondergood
these
are
all
preliminary
essential
steps
what
may
happen
further
i
do
not
know
yet
oh
you
are
jesting
again
you
must
remember
old
man
that
i
myself
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
my
money
it
is
not
money
that
i
need
but
new
activity
you
understand
but
magnus
i
do
not
know
yet
what
his
plans
are
but
it
is
what
magnus
said
that
is
important
to
me
will
compel
you
to
work
wondergood
oh
magnus
is
a
great
man
you
will
see
that
for
yourself
toppi
toppi
frowned
again
and
replied
you
are
master
of
your
money
mr
wondergood
ah
you
have
forgotten
everything
toppi
do
you
remember
about
that
that
i
wanted
to
play
yes
you
did
say
something
about
it
but
i
thought
you
were
joking
no
i
was
not
joking
i
was
only
mistaken
they
do
play
here
but
this
is
not
a
theater
it
is
a
gambling
house
and
so
i
gave
all
my
money
to
magnus
let
him
break
the
bank
you
understand
he
is
the
banker
he
will
manage
the
game
and
i
shall
simply
do
the
betting
quite
a
life
eh
apparently
the
old
fool
understood
nothing
he
kept
raising
and
lowering
his
eyebrows
and
again
inquired
and
how
soon
may
we
expect
your
betrothal
to
signorina
maria
i
do
not
know
yet
toppi
but
that
is
not
the
thing
i
see
you
are
dissatisfied
you
do
not
trust
magnus
oh
signor
magnus
is
a
worthy
man
but
one
thing
i
do
fear
wondergood
if
you
will
permit
me
to
be
frank
he
is
a
man
who
does
not
believe
this
seems
strange
to
me
how
can
the
father
of
signorina
maria
be
a
is
that
not
so
permit
me
to
ask
do
you
intend
to
give
anything
to
his
eminence
that
depends
now
on
magnus
oh
on
signor
magnus
so
so
and
do
you
know
that
his
eminence
has
already
been
to
see
signor
magnus
he
was
here
a
few
days
ago
and
spent
several
hours
in
this
study
you
were
not
at
home
at
that
time
no
i
do
not
know
we
have
not
spoken
about
that
but
have
no
fear
we
will
find
for
the
cardinal
confess
old
man
you
are
quite
enchanted
with
that
old
monkey
toppi
glanced
at
me
sharply
and
sighed
then
he
lapsed
into
thought
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
something
akin
to
a
monkey
appeared
in
his
countenance
as
in
the
cardinal
later
from
somewhere
deep
within
him
there
appeared
a
smile
it
illumined
his
hanging
nose
rose
to
his
eyes
and
blazed
forth
within
them
in
two
bright
little
flames
not
devoid
of
wanton
malice
i
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
even
with
joy
yes
that
was
my
old
toppi
risen
from
his
human
grave
i
am
convinced
that
his
hair
again
has
the
smell
of
fur
instead
of
oil
gently
i
kissed
his
brow
old
habits
can
not
be
rooted
out
and
exclaimed
you
are
enchanting
toppi
but
was
it
that
gave
you
such
joy
i
waited
to
see
whether
he
would
show
maria
to
the
cardinal
well
he
did
not
well
but
toppi
remained
silent
and
as
it
had
come
so
did
the
smile
disappear
slowly
at
first
the
hanging
nose
grew
pale
and
became
quite
indistinct
then
all
at
once
the
flames
within
his
eyes
went
out
and
again
the
old
dejection
sourness
and
odor
of
church
hypocrisy
buried
him
who
had
been
resurrected
for
a
moment
it
would
have
been
useless
to
trouble
the
ashes
with
further
questions
this
happened
yesterday
a
warm
rain
fell
during
the
day
but
it
cleared
up
towards
evening
and
magnus
weary
and
apparently
suffering
with
headache
suggested
that
we
take
a
ride
into
the
campagna
we
left
our
chauffeur
behind
a
practice
peculiar
to
all
our
intimate
trips
his
duties
were
performed
by
magnus
with
extraordinary
skill
and
daring
on
this
occasion
his
usual
daring
reached
the
point
of
audacity
despite
the
twilight
and
the
muddy
road
magnus
drove
the
automobile
at
such
mad
speed
that
more
than
once
did
i
look
up
at
his
broad
motionless
back
but
that
was
only
at
first
the
presence
of
maria
whom
i
supported
with
my
arm
i
do
not
dare
say
embraced
soon
brought
me
to
the
loss
of
all
my
senses
i
can
not
describe
it
all
to
you
so
that
you
would
really
feel
it
the
aromatic
air
of
the
campagna
which
caressed
my
face
the
magnificence
and
charm
of
our
speed
my
virtual
loss
of
all
sensation
of
material
weight
of
the
complete
disappearance
of
when
i
felt
myself
a
speeding
thought
a
flying
gaze
but
still
less
can
i
tell
you
of
her
madonna
gaze
whitened
in
the
twilight
like
marble
like
the
mysterious
silence
and
perfect
beauty
of
marble
was
her
gentle
sweet
and
wise
silence
i
barely
touched
her
slender
supple
figure
but
if
i
had
been
embracing
within
the
hollow
of
my
hand
the
entire
firmness
of
earth
and
sky
i
could
not
have
felt
a
more
complete
mastery
of
the
do
you
know
what
a
line
is
in
measurement
not
much
is
that
not
so
and
it
was
only
by
the
measure
of
a
line
that
maria
bent
her
divine
form
to
me
no
no
more
than
that
but
what
would
you
say
man
if
the
coming
down
from
its
course
just
one
line
were
to
come
closer
to
you
by
that
distance
would
you
not
consider
it
a
my
existence
seemed
unbounded
like
the
universe
which
knows
neither
your
time
nor
distance
for
a
moment
there
gleamed
before
me
the
wall
of
my
unconsciousness
that
unconquerable
barrier
against
which
the
spirit
of
him
who
has
donned
the
human
form
beats
in
vain
and
as
quickly
did
it
disappear
it
was
swallowed
without
sound
or
conflict
by
the
waves
of
my
new
sea
even
higher
they
rose
enshrouding
the
world
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
remember
for
me
or
to
know
my
new
human
soul
remembered
all
and
commanded
all
i
am
a
man
what
gave
me
the
idea
that
i
hate
magnus
i
looked
at
this
motionless
erect
and
firm
human
back
and
thought
that
behind
it
a
heart
was
beating
i
thought
of
how
painful
and
terrible
it
was
for
it
to
remain
firm
and
erect
and
of
how
much
pain
and
suffering
had
already
fallen
to
the
lot
of
this
human
creature
no
matter
how
proud
it
might
appear
or
dejected
and
suddenly
i
realized
to
the
extent
of
pain
and
tears
how
much
i
loved
magnus
this
very
same
magnus
he
speeds
so
wildly
and
has
no
fear
and
the
very
moment
i
sensed
this
maria
eyes
turned
upon
me
ah
they
are
as
bright
at
night
as
they
are
by
day
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
troubled
look
within
them
they
were
asking
why
these
tears
what
could
i
say
in
reply
with
the
aid
of
weak
words
i
silently
took
maria
hand
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
and
without
taking
her
gaze
off
me
shining
in
cold
marble
luster
she
quietly
withdrew
her
hand
and
i
became
confused
and
again
gave
it
to
me
taking
off
her
glove
will
you
permit
me
to
discontinue
man
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
you
who
are
reading
these
lines
and
i
rather
fear
you
your
swift
and
daring
imagination
moreover
a
gentleman
feels
ill
at
ease
in
speaking
of
his
success
with
the
ladies
besides
it
was
time
to
return
on
the
hills
the
lights
of
tivoli
were
already
gleaming
and
magnus
reduced
his
speed
we
were
moving
quite
slowly
on
the
return
trip
and
magnus
grown
merry
wiping
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
now
and
then
addressed
brief
remarks
to
us
there
is
one
thing
i
will
not
conceal
her
unquestionable
womanliness
emphasizes
the
completeness
of
my
transformation
as
we
walked
up
the
broad
stairs
of
my
palazzo
amid
its
princely
wealth
and
beauty
i
suddenly
thought
why
not
send
all
this
adventure
to
the
devil
why
not
simply
wed
and
live
like
a
prince
in
this
palace
there
will
be
freedom
children
laughter
just
earthly
happiness
and
love
and
again
i
looked
at
magnus
he
seemed
strange
to
me
i
will
take
your
money
then
i
saw
the
stern
gaze
of
my
maria
and
the
contradiction
between
her
love
and
this
plan
of
simple
modest
happiness
was
so
great
and
emphatic
that
my
thought
did
not
even
require
an
answer
i
now
recollect
this
thought
accidentally
as
a
curiosity
of
toppism
let
me
call
it
toppism
in
honor
of
my
perfect
toppi
the
evening
was
charming
at
magnus
request
maria
sang
you
can
not
imagine
the
reverence
with
which
toppi
listened
to
her
singing
he
dared
not
utter
a
word
to
maria
but
on
leaving
he
shook
my
hand
long
and
with
particular
warmth
then
similarly
he
shook
the
hand
of
magnus
i
also
rose
to
retire
do
you
intend
to
do
some
work
yet
magnus
no
do
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
wondergood
come
to
my
room
chat
a
bit
incidentally
there
is
a
paper
for
you
to
sign
do
you
want
any
wine
oh
with
pleasure
magnus
i
love
conversation
at
night
we
drank
the
wine
magnus
whistling
something
out
of
tune
silently
walked
the
carpet
while
i
as
usual
reclined
in
a
chair
the
palazzo
was
all
silence
like
a
sarcophagus
and
this
reminded
me
of
that
stirring
night
when
mad
mars
raved
behind
the
wall
suddenly
magnus
exclaimed
loudly
without
hesitation
the
affair
is
progressing
splendidly
so
in
two
weeks
everything
will
be
completed
your
swollen
scattered
wealth
in
which
one
can
be
lost
as
in
a
wood
will
be
transformed
into
a
clear
concise
and
exact
sack
of
gold
to
be
more
correct
into
a
mountain
do
you
know
the
exact
estimate
of
your
money
wondergood
oh
do
magnus
i
do
want
to
know
it
moreover
it
your
money
magnus
looked
at
me
quickly
and
said
sharply
no
it
yours
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
did
not
want
to
argue
it
was
so
quiet
and
i
so
enjoyed
watching
this
strong
man
silently
pacing
to
and
fro
i
still
remembered
his
motionless
stern
back
behind
which
i
could
clearly
see
his
heart
he
continued
after
a
pause
do
you
know
wondergood
that
the
cardinal
has
been
here
the
old
monkey
yes
i
know
what
did
he
want
the
same
thing
he
wanted
to
see
you
but
i
did
not
feel
like
taking
you
away
from
your
thoughts
thanks
did
you
drive
him
out
magnus
replied
angrily
i
am
sorry
to
say
no
do
put
on
airs
wondergood
i
have
already
told
you
that
we
must
be
careful
of
him
as
long
as
we
remain
here
but
you
are
quite
right
he
is
an
old
shaven
useless
evil
gluttonous
cowardly
monkey
ah
ah
then
why
not
show
him
the
door
impossible
i
believe
you
magnus
and
what
does
this
king
i
hear
about
want
he
who
is
to
visit
us
some
of
these
days
probably
the
same
thing
you
should
receive
him
yourself
of
course
but
only
in
your
presence
otherwise
i
refuse
you
must
understand
my
friend
that
from
that
memorable
night
on
i
have
been
merely
your
disciple
you
find
it
impossible
to
drive
out
the
old
monkey
very
well
let
him
remain
you
say
we
must
receive
some
very
well
receive
him
but
i
would
rather
be
hanged
on
the
first
lamppost
than
to
do
so
without
knowing
your
reason
you
are
jesting
again
wondergood
no
i
am
serious
magnus
but
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
that
i
know
not
what
we
are
doing
or
intend
to
do
i
am
not
reproaching
you
i
am
not
even
questioning
you
as
i
have
already
told
you
i
trust
you
and
am
ready
to
follow
your
directions
that
you
may
not
again
reproach
me
with
levity
and
impracticability
i
may
add
a
little
business
detail
maria
and
her
love
are
my
hostages
moreover
i
do
not
yet
know
to
what
you
intend
to
devote
your
energy
of
whose
boundlessness
i
am
becoming
more
convinced
each
day
what
plans
and
ends
your
experience
and
mind
have
set
before
you
but
of
one
thing
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
be
huge
plans
great
objects
and
i
too
shall
always
find
something
to
do
beside
you
at
any
rate
this
will
be
much
better
than
my
brainless
old
women
and
six
secretaries
why
do
you
refuse
to
believe
in
my
modesty
as
i
believe
in
your
genius
imagine
that
i
am
come
from
some
other
planet
from
mars
for
instance
and
wish
in
the
most
serious
manner
possible
to
pass
through
the
experience
of
a
it
is
all
very
simple
magnus
magnus
frowned
at
me
for
a
few
moments
and
suddenly
broke
into
laughter
you
certainly
are
a
pilgrim
from
some
other
planet
wondergood
and
what
if
i
should
devote
your
gold
to
doing
evil
why
is
that
so
very
interesting
hm
you
think
not
interesting
yes
and
so
do
you
you
are
too
big
a
man
to
do
little
evil
just
as
billions
constitute
too
much
money
while
honestly
as
far
as
great
evil
is
concerned
i
know
not
yet
what
is
perhaps
it
is
really
in
my
recent
contemplations
there
came
to
me
a
strange
thought
who
is
of
greater
to
man
he
who
hates
or
he
who
loves
him
you
see
magnus
how
ignorant
i
still
am
of
human
affairs
and
how
ready
i
am
for
almost
anything
without
laughter
and
with
what
seemed
to
me
extreme
curiosity
magnus
measured
me
with
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
deciding
the
question
is
this
a
fool
i
see
before
me
or
the
foremost
sage
of
america
judging
by
his
subsequent
question
he
was
nearer
the
second
opinion
so
if
i
have
correctly
understood
your
words
you
are
afraid
of
mr
wondergood
i
think
and
murder
many
murders
you
remember
the
point
you
made
in
your
story
about
the
boy
of
the
of
the
human
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
i
have
moved
it
forward
several
kilometers
will
that
be
enough
something
like
respect
arose
in
magnus
eyes
the
devil
take
him
though
he
really
considers
me
a
clod
continuing
to
pace
the
room
he
looked
at
me
curiously
several
times
as
if
he
were
trying
to
recall
and
verify
my
remark
then
with
a
quick
movement
he
touched
my
shoulders
you
have
an
active
mind
wondergood
it
is
a
pity
i
did
not
come
to
know
you
before
why
just
so
i
am
interested
to
know
how
you
will
speak
to
the
king
he
will
probably
suggest
something
very
evil
to
you
and
great
evil
is
great
good
is
that
not
so
he
again
broke
into
laughter
and
shook
his
head
in
a
friendly
fashion
i
do
think
so
the
chances
are
he
will
propose
something
very
silly
hm
and
is
that
not
great
wisdom
he
laughed
again
but
frowned
suddenly
and
added
seriously
do
not
feel
hurt
wondergood
i
liked
what
you
said
very
much
and
it
is
well
you
do
not
put
any
questions
to
me
at
this
time
i
could
not
answer
them
just
now
but
there
is
something
i
can
say
even
now
in
general
terms
of
course
are
you
listening
i
am
all
attention
magnus
seated
himself
opposite
me
and
taking
a
sip
of
wine
asked
with
strange
seriousness
how
do
you
regard
explosives
with
great
respect
yes
that
is
cold
praise
but
i
dare
say
they
do
deserve
much
more
yet
there
was
a
time
when
i
worshiped
dynamite
as
i
do
frankness
this
scar
on
my
brow
is
the
result
of
my
youthful
enthusiasm
since
then
i
have
made
great
strides
in
chemistry
and
other
things
and
this
has
cooled
my
zeal
the
drawback
of
every
explosive
beginning
with
powder
is
that
the
explosion
is
confined
to
a
limited
space
and
strikes
only
the
things
near
at
hand
it
might
do
for
war
of
course
but
it
is
quite
inadequate
where
bigger
things
are
concerned
besides
being
a
thing
of
material
limitations
dynamite
or
powder
demands
a
constantly
guiding
hand
in
itself
it
is
dumb
blind
and
deaf
like
a
mole
to
be
sure
in
whitehead
mine
we
find
an
attempt
to
create
consciousness
giving
the
shell
the
power
to
correct
so
to
speak
certain
mistakes
and
to
maintain
a
certain
aim
but
that
is
only
a
pitiful
parody
on
eyesight
and
you
want
your
to
have
consciousness
will
and
eyes
you
are
right
that
is
what
i
want
and
my
new
does
have
these
attributes
will
consciousness
eyes
and
what
is
your
aim
but
this
sounds
terrible
magnus
smiled
faintly
terrible
i
fear
your
terror
will
turn
to
laughter
when
i
give
you
the
name
of
my
dynamite
it
is
have
you
never
looked
at
man
from
this
point
of
view
wondergood
i
confess
no
does
dynamite
too
belong
to
the
domain
of
psychology
this
is
all
very
ridiculous
chemistry
psychology
cried
magnus
angrily
that
is
all
because
knowledge
has
been
subdivided
into
so
many
different
subjects
just
as
a
hand
with
ten
fingers
is
now
a
rarity
you
and
your
toppi
all
of
us
are
explosive
shells
some
loaded
and
ready
others
still
to
be
loaded
and
the
crux
of
the
matter
lies
you
understand
in
how
to
load
the
shell
and
what
is
still
more
important
how
to
explode
it
you
know
of
course
that
the
method
of
exploding
various
preparations
depends
upon
their
respective
compositions
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
here
the
lecture
on
explosives
given
me
by
magnus
with
great
zeal
and
enthusiasm
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
despite
the
absorbing
interest
of
the
subject
as
my
friends
the
journalists
would
say
i
heard
only
half
the
things
he
was
saying
and
concentrated
most
of
my
attention
on
his
skull
the
skull
which
contained
such
wide
and
dangerous
knowledge
whether
it
was
due
to
the
conviction
carried
in
magnus
words
or
to
pure
weariness
i
know
not
which
this
round
skull
blazing
with
the
flames
of
his
eyes
gradually
assumed
the
character
of
a
real
explosive
shell
of
a
bomb
with
the
fuse
lit
for
action
i
trembled
when
magnus
carelessly
threw
upon
the
table
a
heavy
object
resembling
a
cake
of
soap
and
exclaimed
involuntarily
what
that
it
looks
like
soap
or
wax
but
it
has
the
force
of
a
devil
one
half
of
this
would
be
enough
to
blow
peter
into
bits
it
is
a
capricious
devil
you
may
kick
it
about
or
chop
it
into
pieces
you
may
burn
it
in
your
stove
it
will
remain
ever
silent
a
dynamite
shell
may
tear
it
apart
yet
it
will
not
rouse
its
wrath
i
may
throw
it
into
the
street
beneath
the
hoofs
of
horses
the
dogs
may
bite
at
it
and
children
may
play
with
it
and
still
it
remains
indifferent
but
i
need
only
apply
a
current
of
high
pressure
to
it
and
the
force
of
the
explosion
will
be
monstrous
limitless
a
strong
but
silly
devil
with
equal
carelessness
bordering
almost
upon
contempt
magnus
threw
his
devil
back
into
the
table
drawer
and
looked
at
me
sternly
my
eyebrows
twitched
slightly
i
see
you
know
your
subject
to
perfection
and
i
rather
like
this
capricious
devil
of
yours
but
i
would
like
to
hear
you
discuss
magnus
laughed
and
was
it
not
of
him
i
have
just
spoken
is
not
the
history
of
this
piece
of
soap
the
history
of
your
who
can
be
beaten
burned
hacked
to
bits
hurled
beneath
the
hoofs
of
horses
thrown
to
the
dogs
torn
into
shreds
without
rousing
his
consuming
wrath
or
even
his
anger
but
prick
him
with
and
the
explosion
will
be
terrible
as
you
will
learn
mr
wondergood
he
laughed
again
and
rubbed
his
white
hands
with
pleasure
he
scarcely
remembered
at
that
moment
that
human
blood
was
already
upon
them
and
is
it
really
necessary
for
to
remember
that
after
a
pause
commensurate
with
the
respect
due
to
the
subject
i
asked
and
do
you
know
how
to
make
a
explode
certainly
and
would
you
consider
it
permissible
to
give
me
this
information
unfortunately
it
is
not
so
easy
or
convenient
because
the
current
of
high
pressure
would
require
too
much
elucidation
dear
wondergood
ca
you
put
it
briefly
oh
briefly
well
it
is
necessary
to
promise
man
some
is
that
all
that
is
all
lies
once
more
the
old
monkey
yes
lies
again
but
not
the
old
monkey
it
is
not
that
i
have
in
mind
neither
crusades
nor
immortality
in
heaven
this
is
the
period
of
other
miracles
and
other
wonders
he
promised
resurrection
to
the
dead
i
promise
resurrection
to
the
living
his
followers
were
the
dead
mine
ours
are
the
living
but
the
dead
not
how
about
the
living
who
must
make
an
i
can
not
yet
confide
in
you
the
business
end
of
the
enterprise
but
i
warn
you
the
experiment
must
be
conducted
on
a
very
large
scale
you
are
not
afraid
mr
wondergood
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
indicating
nothing
definite
what
could
i
answer
this
gentleman
carrying
upon
his
shoulders
a
bomb
instead
of
a
head
again
split
me
into
two
halves
of
which
alas
was
the
lesser
one
as
wondergood
i
confess
without
shame
i
felt
cruel
fear
and
even
pain
just
as
if
the
monstrous
explosion
had
already
touched
my
bones
and
were
now
breaking
them
ah
but
where
is
my
endless
happiness
with
maria
where
the
boundless
peace
of
mind
where
the
devil
is
that
white
schooner
no
as
great
immortal
curiosity
as
the
genius
of
and
eternal
movement
as
the
rapacious
gaze
of
unclosing
eyes
i
felt
i
confess
this
too
without
shame
great
joy
bordering
upon
ecstasy
and
with
a
shiver
of
delight
i
mumbled
what
a
pity
i
did
not
know
that
before
why
a
pity
oh
just
so
do
not
forget
that
i
am
come
from
another
planet
and
am
only
now
getting
acquainted
with
man
so
what
shall
we
do
with
this
planet
magnus
he
laughed
again
you
are
a
strange
fellow
wondergood
with
this
planet
we
will
give
it
a
little
holiday
but
enough
jesting
i
do
not
like
it
he
frowned
angrily
and
looked
at
me
sternly
like
an
old
professor
the
manner
of
this
gentleman
was
not
distinguished
by
flippancy
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
i
had
grown
sufficiently
serious
he
shook
his
head
in
approval
and
asked
do
you
know
wondergood
that
the
whole
of
europe
is
now
in
a
very
uneasy
state
war
possibly
war
everybody
is
secretly
expecting
it
war
precedes
the
belief
in
the
kingdom
of
you
understand
we
have
lived
too
long
in
simple
faith
in
the
multiplication
table
are
tired
of
the
multiplication
table
are
filled
with
ennui
and
anxiety
on
this
straight
road
whose
mire
is
lost
in
infinity
just
now
all
of
us
are
demanding
some
miracle
and
soon
the
day
will
come
when
we
will
demand
the
miracle
immediately
it
is
not
i
alone
who
wants
experiment
on
a
large
the
whole
world
is
preparing
it
ah
wondergood
in
truth
life
would
not
be
worth
the
candle
if
it
were
not
for
these
highly
interesting
moments
highly
interesting
he
greedily
rubbed
his
hands
you
are
pleased
as
a
chemist
i
am
in
ecstasy
my
shells
are
already
loaded
without
being
themselves
conscious
of
the
fact
but
they
will
know
it
well
enough
when
i
apply
the
torch
can
you
imagine
the
sight
when
dynamite
will
begin
to
explode
its
consciousness
its
will
its
eyes
directed
straight
upon
its
goal
and
blood
perhaps
my
reminder
is
out
of
place
but
i
remember
an
occasion
when
you
spoke
of
with
much
excitement
magnus
fixed
his
long
gaze
upon
me
something
akin
to
suffering
appeared
in
his
eyes
but
this
was
not
the
prick
of
conscience
or
pity
it
was
the
emotion
of
a
mature
and
wise
man
whose
thoughts
had
been
interrupted
by
the
foolish
question
of
a
child
blood
he
said
what
blood
i
recalled
to
him
his
words
on
that
occasion
and
told
him
of
my
strange
and
extremely
unpleasant
dream
about
the
bottles
filled
with
blood
instead
of
wine
and
so
easily
broken
weary
with
his
eyes
closed
he
listened
to
my
tale
and
sighed
heavily
blood
he
murmured
blood
that
nonsense
i
told
you
many
trite
things
on
that
occasion
wondergood
and
it
is
not
worth
while
to
recall
them
however
if
gives
you
fear
it
is
not
too
late
i
replied
resolutely
i
fear
as
i
have
already
said
i
shall
follow
you
everywhere
it
is
blood
that
is
protesting
you
understand
not
my
consciousness
or
will
apparently
i
shall
be
the
first
to
be
fooled
by
you
i
too
seek
a
miracle
is
not
your
a
miracle
i
have
been
repeating
the
multiplication
table
night
and
day
and
i
have
grown
to
hate
it
like
the
bars
of
a
prison
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
chemistry
i
am
quite
loaded
and
i
ask
but
one
thing
blow
me
up
as
quickly
as
possible
magnus
agreed
sternly
very
well
in
about
two
weeks
are
you
satisfied
thank
you
i
hope
that
signorina
maria
will
then
become
my
wife
magnus
laughed
madonna
oh
i
do
understand
your
smile
and
i
must
say
my
hope
is
altogether
in
conformity
with
the
regard
i
bear
for
your
daughter
signor
magnus
do
excite
yourself
wondergood
my
smile
was
not
about
maria
but
about
your
faith
in
miracles
you
are
a
splendid
fellow
wondergood
i
am
beginning
to
love
you
like
a
son
in
two
weeks
you
will
receive
everything
and
then
we
shall
conclude
a
new
and
strong
pact
your
hand
comrade
for
the
first
time
he
shook
my
hand
in
a
strong
comradely
fashion
i
would
have
kissed
him
if
there
had
been
a
simple
human
head
instead
of
a
bomb
upon
his
shoulders
but
to
touch
a
bomb
not
even
in
the
face
of
my
utmost
respect
for
him
that
was
the
first
night
that
i
slept
like
one
slain
and
the
stone
walls
of
the
palace
did
not
press
upon
me
the
walls
were
brushed
by
the
explosive
power
of
magnus
speech
while
the
roof
melted
away
beneath
the
starry
coverlet
of
maria
my
soul
departed
into
the
realms
of
her
calm
love
and
refuge
the
mountain
tivoli
and
its
fires
that
was
what
i
saw
as
i
fell
into
slumber
april
rome
before
knocking
at
my
door
his
majesty
the
had
knocked
at
no
small
number
of
entrances
in
europe
true
to
the
example
of
his
apostolic
ancestors
who
believed
in
the
gold
of
israel
he
particularly
liked
to
approach
jewish
bankers
i
believe
that
the
honor
done
me
by
his
visit
was
based
upon
his
firm
conviction
that
i
was
a
jew
although
his
majesty
was
visiting
rome
incognito
i
warned
of
his
visit
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
bowed
low
to
him
i
think
that
is
the
requirement
of
etiquette
then
also
in
accordance
with
etiquette
we
introduced
ourselves
he
his
adjutant
i
thomas
magnus
i
confess
i
had
not
a
very
flattering
opinion
of
the
former
king
and
that
is
why
he
astonished
me
all
the
more
with
his
high
opinion
of
himself
he
gave
me
his
hand
politely
but
with
such
haughty
indifference
he
looked
at
me
with
such
complete
as
if
he
were
gazing
at
a
being
of
a
lower
order
he
walked
ahead
of
me
so
naturally
sat
down
without
invitation
gazed
upon
the
walls
and
furniture
in
such
frankly
royal
manner
that
my
entire
uneasiness
due
to
my
unfamiliarity
with
etiquette
disappeared
immediately
it
was
only
necessary
to
follow
this
fellow
who
appeared
to
know
everything
so
well
in
appearance
he
was
quite
a
young
man
with
fresh
complexion
and
magnificent
coiffure
somewhat
worn
out
but
sufficiently
with
colorless
eyes
and
a
calm
brazenly
protruding
lower
lip
his
hands
were
beautiful
he
did
not
try
to
conceal
that
he
was
bored
by
my
american
face
which
appeared
jewish
to
him
and
by
the
necessity
of
asking
me
for
money
he
yawned
slightly
after
seating
himself
and
said
sit
down
gentlemen
and
with
a
slight
command
of
the
hand
he
ordered
the
adjutant
to
state
the
nature
of
his
proposal
he
paid
no
attention
to
magnus
at
all
and
while
the
fat
red
and
obliging
adjutant
was
stealthily
narrating
the
story
of
the
misunderstanding
which
caused
the
departure
of
his
majesty
from
his
country
his
majesty
was
nonchalantly
examining
his
feet
finally
he
interrupted
his
representative
speech
with
the
impatient
remark
briefer
marquis
mr
wondergood
is
as
well
familiar
with
this
history
as
we
are
in
a
word
these
fools
kicked
me
out
how
do
you
regard
it
dear
wondergood
how
do
i
regard
it
i
bowed
low
i
am
glad
to
be
of
service
to
your
majesty
well
yes
that
what
they
all
say
but
will
you
give
me
any
money
continue
marquis
the
marquis
smiling
gently
at
me
and
magnus
despite
his
obesity
he
looked
quite
hungry
continued
to
weave
his
thin
flimsy
web
about
the
misunderstanding
until
the
bored
king
again
interrupted
him
you
understand
these
fools
thought
that
i
was
responsible
for
all
their
misfortunes
was
that
silly
wondergood
and
now
they
are
worse
off
than
ever
and
they
write
back
for
god
sake
we
are
perishing
read
the
letters
marquis
at
first
the
king
spoke
with
a
trace
of
excitement
but
apparently
any
effort
soon
wearied
him
the
marquis
obediently
took
a
packet
of
papers
from
the
portfolio
and
tortured
us
with
the
complaints
of
the
orphaned
subjects
begging
their
lord
to
return
i
looked
at
the
king
he
was
no
less
bored
than
we
were
it
was
so
clear
to
him
that
the
people
could
not
exist
without
him
that
all
confirmations
of
this
seemed
superfluous
and
i
felt
so
strange
whence
does
this
miserable
man
get
so
much
happy
confidence
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
bird
unable
to
find
a
crumb
for
himself
sincerely
believed
in
the
peculiar
qualities
of
his
personage
capable
of
bestowing
upon
a
whole
people
marvelous
benefactions
stupidity
training
habit
at
that
moment
the
marquis
was
reading
the
plea
of
some
correspondent
in
which
through
the
web
of
official
mediocrity
and
the
lies
of
swollen
phrases
gleamed
the
very
same
confidence
and
sincere
call
was
that
too
stupidity
and
habit
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
interrupted
the
king
listlessly
that
will
do
marquis
you
may
close
your
portfolio
well
what
you
think
of
it
dear
mr
wondergood
i
will
be
bold
enough
to
say
to
your
majesty
that
i
am
a
representative
of
an
old
democratic
republic
and
stop
wondergood
republic
democracy
that
nonsense
you
know
well
enough
yourself
that
a
king
is
a
necessity
you
in
america
will
have
a
king
too
some
day
how
can
you
get
along
without
a
king
who
will
be
responsible
for
them
before
god
no
that
foolish
this
creature
was
actually
getting
ready
to
answer
for
the
people
before
god
and
he
continued
with
the
same
calm
audacity
the
king
can
do
everything
and
what
can
a
president
do
nothing
do
you
understand
wondergood
why
then
do
you
want
a
president
who
can
do
nothing
he
deigned
to
twist
his
lower
lip
into
a
sarcastic
it
is
all
nonsense
invented
by
the
newspapers
would
you
for
example
take
your
president
seriously
mr
wondergood
but
representative
government
fi
excuse
me
wondergood
he
recalled
my
name
with
great
difficulty
but
what
fool
will
pay
any
attention
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
citizen
a
will
pay
heed
to
citizen
b
and
citizen
b
will
pay
heed
to
citizen
a
is
that
not
so
but
who
will
compel
their
obedience
if
both
of
them
are
wise
no
i
too
have
studied
logic
wondergood
and
you
will
permit
me
to
indulge
in
a
laugh
he
laughed
slightly
and
said
with
his
usual
gesture
continue
marquis
no
let
me
do
it
the
king
can
do
wondergood
you
understand
but
the
law
ah
this
fellow
too
speaks
of
law
do
you
hear
marquis
no
i
really
ca
understand
what
you
want
this
law
for
that
all
may
suffer
equitably
however
if
you
are
so
keen
on
having
law
law
you
shall
have
but
who
will
give
it
to
you
if
not
i
but
the
representatives
of
the
people
the
king
directed
his
colorless
eyes
upon
me
almost
in
despair
ah
again
citizen
a
and
b
but
ca
you
understand
dear
wondergood
what
kind
of
a
law
is
it
if
they
themselves
make
it
what
wise
man
will
agree
to
obey
it
no
that
nonsense
is
it
possible
that
you
yourself
obey
this
law
wondergood
not
only
i
your
majesty
but
the
whole
of
america
his
eyes
measured
me
with
sympathy
pardon
me
but
i
do
believe
it
the
whole
of
america
well
in
that
case
they
simply
do
understand
what
law
is
do
you
hear
marquis
the
whole
of
america
but
that
not
the
thing
i
must
return
wondergood
you
heard
what
the
poor
devils
write
i
am
happy
to
see
that
the
road
is
open
for
you
my
lord
open
you
think
so
hm
no
i
need
money
some
write
and
others
do
you
understand
perhaps
they
do
know
how
to
write
my
lord
they
oh
you
should
have
seen
what
they
wrote
against
me
i
was
quite
flustered
what
they
need
is
the
firing
squad
all
of
them
why
all
of
them
some
of
them
will
be
enough
the
rest
of
them
will
simply
be
scared
to
death
you
understand
wondergood
they
have
simply
stolen
my
power
from
me
and
now
of
course
will
simply
refuse
to
return
it
you
ca
expect
me
to
see
to
it
that
no
one
robs
me
and
these
gentlemen
he
indicated
the
blushing
marquis
to
my
sorrow
did
not
manage
to
guard
my
interests
the
marquis
mumbled
confusedly
sire
now
now
i
know
your
devotion
but
you
were
asleep
at
the
switch
just
the
same
and
now
there
is
so
much
trouble
so
much
trouble
he
sighed
lightly
did
not
cardinal
tell
you
i
needed
money
wondergood
he
promised
to
of
course
i
will
return
it
all
and
however
you
should
take
this
matter
up
with
the
marquis
i
have
heard
that
you
love
people
very
much
mr
wondergood
a
faint
smile
flitted
over
the
dim
face
of
magnus
i
bowed
slightly
the
cardinal
told
me
so
that
is
very
praiseworthy
wondergood
but
if
you
do
love
people
you
will
certainly
give
me
money
i
doubt
that
in
the
least
they
must
have
a
king
the
newspapers
are
merely
prattling
nonsense
why
do
they
have
a
king
in
germany
a
king
in
england
a
king
in
italy
and
a
hundred
other
kings
and
do
we
need
a
king
too
the
adjutant
mumbled
a
misunderstanding
of
course
a
misunderstanding
the
marquis
is
quite
right
the
newspapers
call
it
a
revolution
but
believe
me
i
know
my
people
it
is
simply
a
misunderstanding
they
are
now
weeping
themselves
how
can
they
get
along
without
a
king
there
would
be
no
kings
at
all
then
you
understand
what
nonsense
they
now
talk
of
no
god
too
no
we
must
do
a
little
shooting
a
little
shooting
he
rose
quickly
and
this
time
shook
my
hand
with
a
patronizing
smile
and
bowed
to
magnus
my
dear
wondergood
you
have
a
magnificent
figure
oh
what
a
splendid
fellow
the
marquis
will
drop
in
to
see
you
one
of
these
days
there
was
something
more
i
wanted
to
say
oh
yes
i
hope
that
you
in
america
will
have
a
king
too
in
the
near
future
that
is
very
essential
my
friend
moreover
that
bound
to
be
the
end
au
revoir
we
escorted
his
majesty
with
the
same
ceremony
the
marquis
followed
and
his
bowed
head
divided
into
two
halves
by
the
part
in
his
reddish
hair
and
his
red
face
bore
the
expression
of
hunger
and
constant
failure
ah
he
has
so
frequently
and
so
fruitlessly
orated
about
that
the
king
apparently
also
recalled
at
that
moment
his
vain
knocking
about
at
other
thresholds
his
bloodless
face
again
filled
with
grayish
ennui
and
in
reply
to
my
parting
bow
he
opened
wide
his
eyes
as
if
in
astonishment
with
the
expression
what
more
does
this
fool
want
ah
yes
he
has
money
and
lazily
he
asked
and
so
you
not
forget
mr
and
his
automobile
was
magnificent
and
just
as
magnificent
was
the
huge
chauffeur
resembling
a
gendarme
attired
for
the
new
rôle
when
we
had
reascended
the
stairs
our
respectful
lackeys
meanwhile
gazing
upon
me
as
on
a
royal
personage
and
entered
our
apartments
magnus
fell
into
a
long
ironic
silence
i
asked
how
old
is
this
creature
did
you
know
wondergood
that
bad
he
is
years
old
perhaps
less
did
the
cardinal
really
speak
of
him
and
ask
you
to
give
him
money
yes
from
what
you
may
have
left
after
the
cardinal
wants
are
attended
to
that
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
monarchist
form
of
government
is
also
in
vogue
in
heaven
can
you
conceive
of
a
republic
of
saints
and
the
administration
of
the
world
on
the
basis
of
popular
representation
think
of
it
even
devils
will
then
receive
the
vote
a
king
is
most
necessary
wondergood
believe
me
nonsense
this
is
not
worthy
even
of
a
jest
i
am
not
jesting
you
are
mistaken
and
pardon
me
for
being
so
direct
my
friend
in
his
discussion
about
kings
was
above
you
this
time
you
saw
only
a
creature
a
countenance
of
purely
material
limitations
and
ridiculous
conceived
himself
to
be
a
symbol
that
is
why
he
is
so
calm
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
will
return
to
his
beloved
people
and
will
do
a
little
shooting
and
will
do
a
little
shooting
and
will
throw
a
little
scare
into
them
ah
wondergood
how
stubborn
you
are
in
your
refusal
to
part
with
the
multiplication
table
your
republic
is
a
simple
table
while
a
king
do
you
realize
it
is
a
what
can
there
be
simpler
sillier
and
more
hopeless
than
a
million
bearded
men
governing
themselves
and
how
wonderful
how
miraculous
when
this
million
of
bearded
fellows
are
governed
by
a
creature
that
is
a
miracle
and
what
possibilities
it
gives
rise
to
it
seemed
very
funny
to
me
when
you
spoke
with
so
much
warmth
about
the
law
this
dream
of
the
devil
a
king
is
necessary
for
the
precise
purpose
of
the
law
in
order
that
the
may
be
the
law
but
laws
change
magnus
to
change
is
only
to
submit
to
necessity
and
to
new
law
which
was
unknown
to
you
before
only
by
breaking
the
law
do
you
elevate
the
prove
to
me
that
god
himself
is
subject
to
his
own
laws
to
put
it
simply
that
he
can
not
perform
miracles
and
your
shaven
monkey
will
share
the
fate
of
loneliness
and
all
the
churches
will
be
turned
into
horse
stables
the
miracle
wondergood
the
miracle
that
is
what
holds
human
beings
on
this
cursed
earth
magnus
emphasized
these
words
by
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
his
face
was
gloomy
in
his
dark
eyes
there
flickered
unusual
excitement
speaking
as
if
he
were
threatening
some
one
he
continued
believes
in
miracles
and
i
envy
him
he
is
insignificant
he
is
really
what
you
might
call
a
creature
but
he
believes
in
miracles
and
he
has
already
been
a
king
and
will
be
a
king
again
and
we
he
waved
his
hand
contemptuously
and
began
to
pace
the
carpet
like
an
angry
captain
on
the
deck
of
vessel
with
much
respect
i
gazed
upon
his
heavy
explosive
head
and
blazing
eyes
for
the
first
time
i
realized
what
ambitions
there
were
concealed
in
this
strange
gentlemen
and
we
magnus
noticed
my
gaze
and
shouted
angrily
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
wondergood
it
silly
you
are
thinking
of
my
ambition
that
foolish
wondergood
would
not
a
gentleman
of
illinois
also
like
to
be
well
at
least
emperor
of
where
the
is
still
above
the
law
and
on
what
particular
throne
have
you
your
eye
magnus
i
replied
no
longer
concealing
my
irony
if
you
are
pleased
to
think
of
me
so
flatteringly
wondergood
i
will
tell
you
that
i
much
higher
nonsense
my
friend
only
bloodless
moralists
have
never
dreamt
of
a
crown
just
as
only
eunuchs
have
never
tempted
themselves
with
the
thought
of
woman
nonsense
but
i
do
not
seek
a
throne
not
even
the
russian
throne
it
is
too
cramping
but
there
is
another
throne
signor
magnus
the
throne
of
god
but
why
only
the
throne
of
god
and
have
you
forgotten
satan
mr
wondergood
and
this
he
said
to
me
or
did
the
whole
street
know
that
my
throne
was
vacant
i
bowed
my
head
respectfully
and
said
permit
me
to
be
the
first
to
greet
you
your
majesty
magnus
turned
on
me
in
wild
wrath
gnashing
his
teeth
like
a
dog
over
a
contested
bone
and
this
angry
atom
wants
to
be
satan
this
handful
of
earth
hardly
enough
for
one
whiff
for
the
devil
is
dreaming
to
be
crowned
with
my
crown
i
bowed
my
head
still
lower
and
dropped
my
eyes
i
felt
the
gleaming
flame
of
contempt
and
divine
laughter
blazing
forth
within
them
i
realized
that
it
must
not
be
given
to
my
honored
ward
to
know
this
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
remained
silent
but
when
our
eyes
met
again
they
were
clear
pure
and
innocent
like
two
bright
rays
in
the
shade
magnus
was
the
first
to
speak
and
so
he
said
and
so
i
replied
will
you
order
money
for
the
king
the
money
is
at
your
disposal
my
dear
friend
magnus
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
it
not
worth
while
he
decided
this
miracle
is
old
stuff
it
requires
too
many
police
to
compel
belief
we
shall
perform
a
better
miracle
oh
undoubtedly
we
shall
contrive
a
better
device
in
two
weeks
yes
about
that
replied
magnus
cordially
we
shook
hands
warmly
in
parting
and
in
about
two
hours
the
gracious
king
sent
each
of
us
a
decoration
some
sort
of
a
star
for
me
and
something
else
for
magnus
i
rather
pitied
the
poor
idiot
who
continued
to
play
his
lone
hand
april
rome
maria
is
somewhat
indisposed
and
i
hardly
see
her
magnus
informed
me
of
her
illness
and
lied
about
it
for
some
reason
he
does
not
want
me
to
see
her
does
he
fear
anything
again
cardinal
called
on
him
in
my
absence
nothing
is
being
said
to
me
about
the
miracle
but
i
am
patient
and
i
wait
at
first
this
was
rather
boresome
but
recently
i
have
found
a
new
pastime
and
now
i
am
quite
content
it
is
the
roman
museums
where
i
spend
my
mornings
like
a
conscientious
american
who
has
just
learned
to
distinguish
between
a
painting
and
a
piece
of
sculpture
but
i
have
no
baedecker
with
me
and
i
am
strangely
happy
that
i
do
understand
a
thing
about
it
all
marble
and
painting
i
merely
like
it
i
like
the
odor
of
the
sea
in
the
museums
why
the
sea
i
do
not
know
the
sea
is
far
away
and
i
rather
expected
the
odor
of
decay
and
it
is
so
spacious
here
much
more
spacious
than
the
campagna
in
the
campagna
i
see
only
space
over
which
run
trains
and
automobiles
here
i
swim
in
time
there
is
so
much
time
here
then
too
i
rather
like
the
fact
that
here
they
preserve
with
great
care
a
chip
of
a
marble
foot
or
a
stony
sole
with
a
bit
of
the
heel
like
an
ass
from
illinois
i
simply
can
not
understand
what
value
there
is
in
this
but
i
already
believe
that
it
is
valuable
and
i
am
touched
by
your
careful
thrift
little
man
preserve
it
go
on
breaking
the
feet
of
live
men
that
is
nothing
but
these
you
must
preserve
it
is
good
indeed
when
living
dying
ever
changing
men
for
the
space
of
years
take
such
good
care
of
a
chip
of
marble
foot
when
i
enter
the
narrow
museum
from
the
roman
street
where
every
stone
is
drowned
in
the
light
of
the
april
sun
its
transparent
and
even
shadow
seems
to
me
a
peculiar
light
more
durable
than
the
expensive
rays
of
the
sun
as
far
as
i
it
is
thus
that
eternity
doth
shine
and
these
marbles
they
have
swallowed
as
much
sunlight
as
an
englishman
whiskey
before
they
were
driven
into
this
place
that
they
do
not
fear
night
at
all
and
i
too
do
not
fear
the
night
when
i
am
near
them
take
care
of
them
man
if
is
what
you
call
art
what
an
ass
you
are
wondergood
of
course
you
are
cultured
you
look
upon
art
with
reverence
as
upon
religion
and
you
have
understood
as
much
of
it
as
that
ass
did
on
which
the
messiah
entered
jerusalem
and
what
if
there
should
be
a
fire
yesterday
this
thought
troubled
me
all
day
and
i
went
with
it
to
magnus
but
he
seems
extremely
occupied
with
something
and
could
not
at
first
understand
what
i
was
driving
at
what
the
trouble
wondergood
you
want
to
insure
the
vatican
or
something
else
make
it
clearer
oh
to
insure
i
exclaimed
in
anger
you
are
a
barbarian
thomas
magnus
at
last
he
understood
smiling
cordially
he
stretched
yawned
and
laid
some
paper
before
me
you
really
are
a
gentleman
from
mars
dear
wondergood
contradict
and
sign
this
paper
it
is
the
last
one
i
will
sign
but
under
one
condition
your
explosion
must
not
touch
the
vatican
he
laughed
again
would
you
be
sorry
then
you
had
better
not
sign
in
general
if
you
are
sorry
about
anything
about
anything
at
all
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
part
before
it
is
too
late
there
is
no
room
for
pity
in
my
game
and
my
play
is
not
for
sentimental
american
girls
if
you
please
i
signed
the
paper
and
threw
it
aside
but
it
seems
as
if
you
have
earnestly
entered
upon
the
duties
of
satan
dear
magnus
and
does
satan
have
duties
poor
satan
then
i
do
want
to
be
satan
neither
duties
nor
obligations
neither
duties
nor
obligations
and
what
then
he
glanced
at
me
quickly
with
his
gleaming
eyes
and
replied
with
one
short
word
which
cut
the
air
before
my
face
and
the
current
of
high
pressure
magnus
smiled
patronizingly
i
am
very
glad
that
you
remember
my
words
so
well
wondergood
they
may
be
of
use
to
you
some
day
cursed
dog
i
felt
so
much
like
striking
him
that
i
bowed
particularly
low
and
politely
but
he
restrained
me
with
a
gracious
gesture
pointing
to
a
chair
where
are
you
going
wondergood
sit
down
we
have
seen
so
little
of
each
other
of
late
how
is
your
health
fine
thank
you
and
how
is
the
health
of
signorina
maria
not
particularly
good
but
it
a
trifle
a
few
more
days
of
waiting
and
you
so
you
like
the
museums
wondergood
there
was
a
time
when
i
too
gave
them
much
time
and
feeling
yes
i
remember
i
remember
do
you
find
wondergood
that
man
in
mass
is
a
repulsive
being
i
raised
my
eyes
in
astonishment
i
do
not
quite
understand
this
change
of
subject
magnus
on
the
contrary
the
museums
have
revealed
to
me
a
new
and
more
attractive
side
of
man
he
laughed
love
for
mankind
well
well
do
not
take
offense
at
the
jest
wondergood
you
see
everything
that
man
does
in
crayon
is
wonderful
but
repulsive
in
painting
take
the
sketch
of
christianity
with
its
sermon
on
the
mount
its
lilies
and
its
ears
of
corn
how
marvelous
it
is
and
how
ugly
is
its
picture
with
its
sextons
its
funeral
pyres
and
its
cardinal
a
genius
begins
the
work
and
an
idiot
an
animal
completes
it
the
pure
and
fresh
wave
of
the
ocean
tide
strikes
the
dirty
shore
and
returns
dirty
bearing
back
with
it
corks
and
shells
the
beginning
of
love
the
beginning
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
great
revolution
how
good
are
all
beginnings
and
their
end
and
even
if
a
man
here
and
there
has
managed
to
die
as
beautifully
as
he
was
born
the
masses
the
masses
wondergood
invariably
end
the
liturgy
in
shamelessness
oh
but
what
about
the
causes
magnus
the
causes
apparently
we
find
concealed
here
the
very
of
man
of
animal
evil
and
limited
in
the
mass
inclined
to
madness
easily
inoculated
with
all
sorts
of
disease
and
crowning
the
widest
possible
road
with
a
standstill
and
that
is
why
art
is
so
much
above
man
i
do
not
understand
is
there
incomprehensible
about
it
in
art
it
is
the
genius
who
begins
and
the
genius
completes
you
understand
the
genius
the
fool
the
imitator
or
the
critic
is
quite
powerless
to
change
or
mar
the
paintings
of
velasquez
the
sculpture
of
angelo
or
the
verse
of
homer
he
can
destroy
smash
break
burn
or
deface
but
he
is
quite
powerless
to
bring
them
down
to
his
own
level
and
that
is
why
he
so
detests
real
art
you
understand
wondergood
his
paw
is
helpless
magnus
waved
his
white
hand
and
laughed
but
why
does
he
guard
and
protect
it
so
assiduously
it
is
not
who
guards
and
protects
this
is
done
by
a
special
species
of
magnus
laughed
again
and
did
you
observe
how
uncomfortable
they
feel
in
the
museum
who
they
well
those
who
came
to
view
the
things
but
the
most
ridiculous
phase
of
the
whole
business
is
not
that
the
fool
is
a
fool
but
that
the
genius
unswervedly
worships
the
fool
as
a
neighbor
and
fellow
being
and
anxiously
seeks
his
devastating
love
as
if
he
were
a
savage
himself
the
genius
does
not
understand
that
true
neighbor
is
a
genius
similar
to
himself
and
he
is
eternally
opening
his
embraces
to
the
near
human
who
eagerly
crawls
into
them
in
order
to
abstract
the
watch
from
his
vest
pocket
yes
my
dear
wondergood
it
is
a
most
laughable
point
and
i
fear
he
lapsed
into
thought
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
thus
apparently
do
human
beings
gaze
into
the
depths
of
their
own
graves
and
i
understood
just
what
this
genius
feared
and
once
again
i
bowed
before
the
satanic
mind
which
in
all
the
world
recognized
only
itself
and
its
own
will
here
was
a
god
who
would
not
share
his
power
with
olympus
and
what
a
contempt
for
mankind
and
what
open
contempt
for
me
here
was
a
grain
of
earth
that
could
make
the
devil
himself
sneeze
and
do
you
know
how
i
concluded
that
evening
i
took
my
pious
toppi
by
the
neck
and
threatened
to
shoot
him
if
he
did
not
get
drunk
with
me
and
drunk
we
did
get
we
began
in
some
dirty
little
café
and
continued
in
some
night
taverns
where
i
generously
filled
some
bandits
with
liquor
mandolin
players
and
singers
who
sang
to
me
of
maria
i
drank
like
a
farm
hand
who
had
just
arrived
in
the
city
after
a
year
of
sober
labor
away
with
the
museums
i
remember
that
i
shouted
much
and
waved
my
hands
but
never
did
i
love
my
so
tenderly
so
sweetly
and
so
painfully
as
in
that
smoke
of
drink
permeated
with
the
odor
of
wine
oranges
and
some
burning
fat
in
this
wide
circle
of
black
bearded
stealthy
faces
and
rapaciously
gleaming
eyes
amid
the
melodious
strains
of
mandolins
which
opened
for
me
the
very
vestibules
of
heaven
and
hell
i
vaguely
remember
some
very
accommodating
but
pompous
murderers
whom
i
kissed
and
forgave
in
the
name
of
maria
i
remember
that
i
proposed
that
all
of
us
go
to
drink
in
the
coliseum
in
the
very
place
where
martyrs
used
to
die
but
i
do
not
know
why
we
did
not
do
it
i
believe
there
were
technical
difficulties
and
how
splendid
toppi
was
at
first
he
drank
long
and
silently
like
an
archbishop
then
he
suddenly
began
to
perform
interesting
feats
he
put
a
bottle
of
chianti
on
his
nose
the
wine
running
all
over
him
he
tried
to
perform
some
tricks
with
cards
but
was
immediately
caught
by
the
affable
bandits
who
brilliantly
repeated
the
same
trick
he
walked
on
all
fours
and
sang
some
religious
verses
through
his
nose
he
cried
and
suddenly
announced
frankly
that
he
was
a
devil
we
walked
home
staggering
along
the
street
bumping
into
walls
and
lampposts
and
hilariously
enjoying
ourselves
like
two
students
toppi
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
some
policemen
but
touched
by
their
politeness
he
ended
by
conferring
his
stern
blessing
upon
them
saying
gloomily
go
and
sin
no
more
then
he
confessed
with
tears
that
he
was
in
love
with
a
certain
signorina
that
his
love
was
requited
and
that
he
must
therefore
resign
his
spiritual
calling
saying
this
he
lay
down
upon
a
stony
threshold
and
fell
into
a
stubborn
sleep
and
thus
i
left
him
maria
maria
how
you
tempt
me
not
once
have
i
touched
your
lips
yesterday
i
kissed
only
red
wine
but
whence
come
these
burning
traces
on
my
lips
but
yesterday
i
stood
upon
my
knees
madonna
and
covered
you
with
flowers
but
yesterday
i
timidly
laid
hands
upon
the
hem
of
your
garment
and
you
are
only
a
woman
and
i
want
you
my
hands
are
trembling
the
obstacles
the
halls
the
paces
and
the
thresholds
separating
us
drive
me
mad
i
want
you
i
did
not
recognize
my
own
eyes
in
the
mirror
there
is
a
thick
shadow
upon
them
i
breathe
heavily
and
irregularly
and
all
day
long
my
thoughts
are
wandering
lustfully
about
your
naked
breast
i
have
forgotten
everything
in
whose
power
am
i
it
bends
me
like
soft
heated
iron
i
am
deafened
i
am
blinded
by
my
own
heat
and
sparks
what
do
you
do
man
when
happens
to
you
do
you
simply
go
and
take
the
woman
do
you
violate
her
think
it
is
night
now
and
maria
is
so
close
by
i
can
approach
her
room
without
a
sound
and
i
want
to
hear
her
cries
but
suppose
magnus
bars
the
road
for
me
i
will
kill
magnus
nonsense
no
tell
me
in
whose
power
am
i
you
ought
to
know
that
man
just
before
evening
as
i
was
seeking
to
escape
from
myself
and
maria
i
wandered
about
the
streets
but
it
was
worse
there
everywhere
i
saw
men
and
women
men
and
women
as
if
i
had
never
seen
them
before
they
all
appeared
naked
to
me
i
stood
long
at
and
tried
to
grasp
what
a
sunset
was
but
could
not
before
me
there
passed
by
in
endless
procession
those
men
and
women
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
tell
me
what
is
woman
i
saw
one
very
beautiful
in
an
automobile
the
sunset
threw
a
rosy
glow
upon
her
pale
face
and
in
her
ears
there
glistened
two
diamond
sparks
she
gazed
upon
the
sunset
and
the
sunset
gazed
on
her
but
i
could
not
endure
it
sorrow
and
love
gripped
my
heart
as
if
i
were
dying
there
behind
her
were
trees
green
almost
black
maria
maria
april
isle
of
capri
perfect
calm
reigned
upon
the
sea
from
a
high
precipice
i
gazed
long
upon
a
little
schooner
motionless
in
the
blue
expanse
its
white
sails
were
rigidly
still
and
it
seemed
as
happy
as
on
that
memorable
day
and
again
great
calm
descended
upon
me
while
the
holy
name
of
resounded
purely
and
peacefully
like
the
sabbath
bells
on
the
distant
shore
there
i
lay
upon
the
grass
my
face
toward
the
sky
the
good
earth
warmed
my
back
while
my
eyes
were
pierced
with
warm
light
as
if
i
had
thrust
my
face
into
the
sun
not
more
than
three
paces
away
there
lay
an
abyss
a
steep
precipice
a
dizzying
wall
and
it
was
delightful
to
imbibe
the
odor
of
grass
and
the
spring
flowers
of
capri
there
was
also
the
odor
of
toppi
who
was
lying
beside
me
when
he
is
heated
by
the
sun
he
emits
the
smell
of
fur
he
was
all
sunburned
just
as
if
he
had
been
smeared
with
coal
in
general
he
is
a
very
amiable
old
devil
the
place
where
we
lay
is
called
anacapri
and
constitutes
the
elevated
part
of
the
island
the
sun
had
already
set
when
we
began
our
trip
downward
and
a
half
moon
had
risen
in
the
sky
but
there
was
the
same
quiet
and
warmth
and
from
somewhere
came
the
strains
of
mandolins
in
love
calling
to
maria
maria
everywhere
but
my
love
breathed
with
great
calm
bathed
in
the
pure
moonlight
rays
like
the
little
white
houses
below
in
such
a
house
at
one
time
did
maria
live
and
into
just
such
a
house
i
will
take
her
in
about
four
days
a
high
wall
along
which
the
road
ran
concealed
the
moon
from
us
and
here
we
beheld
the
statue
of
an
old
madonna
standing
in
a
niche
high
above
the
road
and
the
surrounding
bushes
before
her
burned
with
a
weak
flame
the
light
of
an
and
she
seemed
so
alive
in
her
watchful
silence
that
my
heart
grew
cold
with
sweet
terror
toppi
bowed
his
head
and
mumbled
a
prayer
while
i
removed
my
hat
and
thought
how
high
above
this
earthly
vessel
filled
with
moonlit
twilight
and
mysterious
charms
you
stand
thus
does
stand
above
my
soul
enough
here
again
the
extraordinary
begins
and
i
must
pause
we
shall
soon
drink
some
champagne
and
then
we
shall
go
to
the
café
i
understand
they
expect
some
mandolin
players
from
naples
there
toppi
would
rather
be
shot
than
follow
me
his
conscience
troubles
him
to
this
day
but
it
is
good
that
i
will
be
alone
april
rome
palazzo
orsini
night
my
palace
is
dead
and
silent
as
if
it
were
one
of
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
beyond
the
large
window
lies
the
garden
it
is
transparent
and
white
with
the
rays
of
the
moon
and
the
vaporous
pole
of
the
fountain
resembles
a
headless
vision
in
a
silver
veil
its
splash
is
scarcely
heard
through
the
thick
as
if
it
were
the
sleepy
mumbling
of
the
night
guard
yes
this
is
all
beautiful
and
how
do
you
put
it
it
breathes
with
love
of
course
it
would
be
good
to
walk
beside
maria
over
the
blue
sand
of
the
garden
path
and
to
trample
upon
her
shadow
but
i
am
disturbed
and
my
disquiet
is
wider
than
love
in
my
attempts
to
walk
lightly
i
wander
about
the
room
lean
against
the
wall
recline
in
silence
in
the
corners
and
all
the
time
i
seem
to
hear
something
something
far
away
a
thousand
kilometers
from
here
or
is
this
all
lodged
in
my
memory
that
which
i
strain
my
ear
to
catch
and
the
thousand
kilometers
are
they
the
thousand
years
of
my
life
you
would
be
astonished
if
you
saw
how
i
was
dressed
my
fine
american
costume
had
suddenly
become
unbearably
heavy
so
i
put
on
my
bathing
suit
this
made
me
appear
thin
tall
and
wiry
i
tried
to
test
my
nimbleness
by
crawling
about
the
floor
suddenly
changing
the
direction
like
a
noiseless
bat
but
it
is
not
i
who
am
restless
it
is
my
muscles
that
are
filled
with
this
unrest
and
i
know
not
what
they
want
then
i
began
to
feel
cold
i
dressed
and
sat
down
to
write
i
drank
some
wine
and
drew
down
the
curtains
to
shut
the
white
garden
from
my
eyes
then
i
examined
and
fixed
my
browning
i
intend
to
take
it
with
me
for
a
friendly
chat
with
magnus
you
see
thomas
magnus
has
some
that
is
what
he
calls
those
gentlemen
unknown
to
me
who
respectfully
get
out
of
my
way
when
we
meet
but
never
greet
me
as
if
we
were
meeting
in
the
street
and
not
in
my
house
there
were
two
of
them
when
i
went
to
capri
now
they
are
six
according
to
what
toppi
tells
me
and
they
live
here
toppi
does
not
like
them
neither
do
i
they
seem
to
have
no
i
could
not
see
them
i
happened
to
think
of
that
just
now
when
i
tried
to
recall
them
these
are
my
assistants
magnus
told
me
without
trying
in
the
least
to
conceal
his
ridicule
well
i
must
say
magnus
they
have
had
bad
training
they
never
greet
me
when
we
meet
on
the
contrary
dear
wondergood
they
are
very
they
simply
can
not
bring
themselves
to
greet
you
without
a
proper
introduction
they
are
extremely
correct
people
however
you
will
learn
all
do
frown
be
patient
wondergood
just
one
more
night
how
is
signorina
maria
health
she
will
be
well
he
placed
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
brought
his
dark
evil
brazen
eyes
closer
to
my
face
the
passion
of
love
eh
i
shook
off
his
hand
and
shouted
signor
magnus
i
you
he
frowned
at
me
and
calmly
turned
his
back
upon
me
till
mr
wondergood
that
is
why
i
loaded
my
revolver
in
the
evening
i
was
handed
a
letter
from
magnus
he
begged
my
pardon
said
his
conduct
was
due
to
unusual
excitement
and
he
sincerely
sought
my
friendship
and
confidence
he
also
agreed
that
his
are
really
folk
i
gazed
long
upon
these
hasty
illegible
lines
and
felt
like
taking
with
me
not
my
revolver
but
a
cannon
one
more
night
but
how
long
it
is
is
danger
facing
i
feel
it
and
my
muscles
it
too
do
you
think
that
i
am
merely
afraid
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
no
i
know
not
where
my
fear
has
disappeared
but
only
a
short
while
ago
i
was
afraid
of
everything
of
darkness
death
and
the
most
inconsequential
pain
and
now
i
fear
nothing
i
only
feel
strange
is
that
how
you
put
it
strange
here
i
am
on
your
earth
man
and
i
am
thinking
of
another
person
who
is
dangerous
to
me
and
i
myself
am
man
and
there
is
the
moon
and
the
fountain
and
there
is
maria
whom
i
love
and
here
is
a
glass
and
wine
and
this
is
my
and
your
life
or
did
i
simply
imagine
that
i
was
satan
once
i
see
is
all
an
invention
the
fountain
and
maria
and
my
very
thoughts
on
the
man
magnus
but
the
my
mind
can
neither
unravel
nor
understand
i
assiduously
examine
my
memory
and
it
is
silent
like
a
closed
book
and
i
have
no
power
to
open
this
enchanted
volume
concealing
the
whole
past
of
my
being
straining
my
eyesight
i
gaze
into
the
bright
and
distant
depth
from
which
i
came
upon
this
pasteboard
earth
but
i
see
nothing
in
the
painful
ebb
and
flow
of
the
boundless
fog
there
behind
the
fog
is
my
country
but
it
seems
it
seems
i
have
quite
forgotten
the
road
i
have
again
returned
to
wondergood
bad
habit
of
getting
drunk
alone
and
i
am
slightly
drunk
now
no
matter
it
is
the
last
time
i
have
just
seen
something
after
which
i
wish
to
see
nothing
else
i
felt
like
taking
a
look
at
the
white
garden
and
to
imagine
how
it
would
feel
to
walk
beside
maria
over
the
path
of
blue
sand
i
turned
off
the
light
in
the
room
and
opened
wide
the
draperies
and
the
white
garden
arose
before
me
like
a
dream
and
think
of
it
over
the
path
of
blue
sand
there
walked
a
man
and
a
woman
and
the
woman
was
maria
they
walked
quietly
trampling
upon
their
own
shadows
and
the
man
embraced
her
the
little
counting
machine
in
my
breast
beat
madly
fell
to
the
floor
and
broke
when
finally
i
recognized
the
man
it
was
magnus
only
magnus
dear
magnus
the
father
may
he
be
cursed
with
his
fatherly
embraces
ah
how
my
love
for
surged
up
again
within
me
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
the
window
and
stretched
out
my
hands
to
her
to
be
sure
i
had
already
seen
something
of
that
kind
in
the
theater
but
it
all
the
same
to
me
i
stretched
out
my
hands
was
i
not
alone
and
drunk
why
should
i
not
do
what
i
want
to
do
madonna
then
i
suddenly
drew
down
the
curtain
quietly
like
a
web
like
a
handful
of
moonlight
i
will
take
this
vision
and
weave
it
into
night
dreams
quietly
quietly
iv
may
italy
had
i
at
my
disposal
not
the
pitiful
word
but
a
strong
orchestra
i
would
compel
all
the
brass
trumpets
to
roar
i
would
raise
their
blazing
mouths
to
the
sky
and
would
compel
them
to
rave
incessantly
in
a
blazen
screeching
voice
which
would
make
one
hair
stand
on
end
and
scatter
the
clouds
in
terror
i
do
not
want
the
lying
violins
hateful
to
me
is
the
gentle
murmur
of
false
strings
beneath
the
fingers
of
liars
and
scoundrels
breath
breath
my
gullet
is
like
a
brass
horn
my
breath
a
hurricane
driving
forward
into
every
narrow
cleft
and
all
of
me
rings
kicks
and
grates
like
a
heap
of
iron
in
the
face
of
the
wind
oh
it
is
not
always
the
mighty
wrathful
roar
of
brass
trumpets
frequently
very
frequently
it
is
the
pitiful
wail
of
burned
rusty
iron
crawling
along
lonely
like
the
winter
the
whistle
of
bent
twigs
which
drives
thought
cold
and
fills
the
heart
with
the
rust
of
gloom
and
homelessness
everything
that
fire
can
touch
has
burned
up
within
me
was
it
i
who
wanted
to
play
was
it
i
who
yearned
for
the
game
then
look
upon
this
monstrous
ruin
of
the
theater
wrecked
by
the
flames
all
the
actors
too
have
lost
their
lives
ah
all
the
actors
too
have
perished
and
brazen
truth
peers
now
through
the
beggarly
holes
of
its
empty
windows
by
my
throne
what
was
that
love
i
prattled
of
when
i
donned
this
human
form
to
whom
was
it
that
i
opened
my
embraces
was
it
you
comrade
by
my
throne
if
i
was
love
but
a
single
henceforth
i
am
hate
and
thus
i
remain
let
us
halt
at
this
point
dear
comrade
it
has
been
quite
some
time
since
i
moved
my
pen
upon
this
paper
and
i
must
now
grow
accustomed
anew
to
your
dull
and
shallow
face
smeared
with
the
red
of
your
cheeks
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
how
to
speak
the
language
of
respectable
people
who
have
just
received
a
trouncing
get
thee
hence
my
friend
i
am
a
brass
trumpet
tickle
not
my
throat
little
worm
leave
me
may
italy
it
was
a
month
ago
that
thomas
magnus
me
up
yes
it
is
true
he
really
blew
me
up
and
it
was
a
month
ago
in
the
holy
city
of
rome
in
the
palazzo
orsini
when
i
still
belonged
to
the
billionaire
henry
wondergood
do
you
remember
that
genial
american
with
his
cigar
and
patent
gold
teeth
alas
he
is
no
longer
with
us
he
died
suddenly
and
you
will
do
well
if
you
order
a
requiem
mass
for
him
his
illinois
soul
is
in
need
of
your
prayers
let
us
return
however
to
his
last
hours
i
shall
try
to
be
exact
in
my
recollections
and
give
you
not
only
the
emotions
but
also
the
words
of
that
evening
it
was
evening
when
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
perhaps
i
shall
not
give
you
quite
the
words
spoken
but
at
any
rate
they
will
be
the
words
i
heard
and
stored
away
in
my
memory
if
you
were
ever
whipped
worthy
comrade
then
you
know
how
difficult
it
was
for
you
to
count
all
the
blows
of
the
whip
a
change
of
gravity
you
understand
oh
you
understand
everything
and
so
let
us
receive
the
last
breath
of
henry
wondergood
blown
up
by
the
culprit
thomas
magnus
and
buried
by
i
remember
i
awoke
on
the
morning
after
that
evening
calm
and
even
gay
apparently
it
was
the
effect
of
the
sun
shining
into
that
same
broad
window
through
which
at
night
there
streamed
that
unwelcome
and
too
highly
significant
moonlight
you
understand
now
the
moon
and
now
the
sun
oh
you
understand
everything
it
is
probably
for
the
very
same
reason
i
acquired
my
touching
faith
in
the
integrity
of
magnus
and
awaited
toward
evening
that
cloudless
bliss
this
expectation
was
all
the
greater
because
his
collaborators
you
remember
his
collaborators
had
begun
to
and
to
me
what
is
a
greeting
ah
how
much
it
means
to
the
faith
of
man
you
know
my
good
manners
and
therefore
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
was
cold
and
restrained
like
a
gentleman
who
has
just
received
a
legacy
but
if
you
had
put
your
ear
to
my
belly
you
would
have
heard
violins
playing
within
something
about
love
you
understand
oh
you
understand
everything
and
thus
with
these
violins
did
i
come
to
magnus
in
the
evening
when
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
magnus
was
alone
we
were
long
silent
and
this
indicated
that
an
interesting
conversation
awaited
me
finally
i
said
how
is
the
signorina
health
but
he
interrupted
me
we
are
facing
a
very
difficult
talk
wondergood
does
that
disturb
you
oh
no
not
at
all
do
you
want
wine
well
never
mind
i
shall
drink
a
little
but
you
need
not
yes
wondergood
he
laughed
as
he
poured
out
the
wine
and
here
i
noticed
with
astonishment
that
he
himself
was
excited
his
large
white
hangman
hands
were
quite
noticeably
trembling
i
do
not
know
exactly
just
when
my
violins
ceased
i
think
it
was
at
that
very
moment
magnus
gulped
down
two
glasses
of
wine
he
had
intended
to
take
only
a
little
and
sitting
down
continued
no
you
ought
not
to
drink
wondergood
i
need
all
your
undimmed
by
anything
you
did
drink
anything
no
good
your
must
be
clear
and
sober
one
must
not
take
anesthetics
in
such
cases
as
as
as
vivisection
he
shook
his
head
seriously
in
affirmation
yes
vivisection
you
have
caught
my
idea
marvelously
yes
in
cases
of
vivisection
of
the
soul
for
instance
when
a
loving
mother
is
informed
of
the
death
of
her
son
or
a
rich
man
that
he
has
become
penniless
but
the
senses
what
can
we
do
with
the
senses
we
can
not
hold
them
in
leash
all
our
life
you
understand
wondergood
in
the
long
run
i
am
not
in
the
least
so
cruel
a
man
as
i
occasionally
seem
even
to
myself
and
the
of
others
frequently
arouses
in
me
an
unpleasant
responsive
trembling
that
is
not
good
a
surgeon
hand
must
be
firm
he
looked
at
his
fingers
they
no
longer
trembled
he
continued
with
a
smile
however
wine
helps
some
dear
wondergood
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
by
which
you
love
so
to
swear
that
it
is
extremely
unpleasant
for
me
to
cause
you
this
little
pain
keep
your
senses
wondergood
your
senses
your
senses
your
hand
my
friend
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
magnus
enveloped
my
palm
and
fingers
and
held
them
long
in
his
own
paw
strained
permeated
with
some
kind
of
electric
currents
then
he
let
them
go
sighing
with
relief
that
it
just
so
courage
wondergood
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
lit
a
cigar
and
asked
your
illustration
of
the
wealthy
man
who
has
suddenly
become
a
beggar
does
that
concern
me
am
i
penniless
magnus
answered
slowly
as
he
gazed
straight
into
my
eyes
if
you
wish
to
put
it
that
way
yes
you
have
nothing
left
absolutely
nothing
and
this
palace
too
is
already
sold
the
new
owners
take
possession
oh
that
is
interesting
and
where
are
my
billions
i
have
them
they
are
mine
i
am
a
very
wealthy
man
wondergood
i
moved
my
cigar
to
the
other
corner
of
my
mouth
and
asked
and
you
are
ready
of
course
to
give
me
a
helping
hand
you
are
a
contemptible
scoundrel
thomas
magnus
if
that
what
you
call
me
yes
something
on
that
order
and
a
liar
perhaps
in
general
dear
wondergood
it
is
very
necessary
for
you
to
change
your
outlook
on
life
and
man
you
are
too
much
of
an
idealist
and
you
i
rose
from
my
chair
for
you
it
is
necessary
to
change
your
fellow
conversationalist
permit
me
to
bid
you
and
to
send
a
police
commissary
in
my
place
magnus
laughed
nonsense
wondergood
everything
has
been
done
within
the
law
you
yourself
have
handed
over
everything
to
me
this
will
surprise
no
one
with
your
love
for
humanity
of
course
you
can
proclaim
yourself
insane
you
understand
and
then
perhaps
i
may
get
to
the
penitentiary
but
you
you
will
land
in
an
insane
asylum
you
would
hardly
like
that
dear
friend
police
well
go
on
talking
it
will
relieve
the
first
effects
of
the
blow
i
think
it
was
really
difficult
for
me
to
conceal
my
excitement
i
hurled
my
cigar
angrily
into
the
fireplace
while
my
eye
carefully
measured
both
the
window
and
magnus
no
this
carcass
was
too
big
to
play
ball
with
at
that
moment
the
loss
of
my
wealth
had
not
yet
fully
impressed
itself
upon
my
mind
and
it
was
that
which
maddened
me
as
much
as
the
brazen
tone
of
magnus
and
the
patronizing
manner
of
the
old
scoundrel
in
addition
i
dimly
sensed
something
portentous
of
evil
and
sorrow
like
a
threat
as
if
some
real
danger
were
lurking
not
in
front
of
me
but
behind
my
back
what
is
this
all
about
i
shouted
stamping
my
foot
what
is
this
all
about
replied
magnus
like
an
echo
yes
i
really
can
not
understand
why
you
are
so
excited
wondergood
you
have
so
frequently
offered
me
this
money
and
even
forced
it
upon
me
and
now
when
the
money
is
in
my
hands
you
want
to
call
the
police
of
course
magnus
smiled
there
is
a
slight
distinction
here
in
placing
your
money
so
magnanimously
at
my
you
still
remained
its
master
and
the
master
of
the
situation
while
now
you
understand
old
friend
now
i
can
simply
drive
you
out
of
this
house
i
looked
at
magnus
significantly
he
replied
with
no
less
a
significant
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
cried
angrily
stop
your
nonsense
i
am
stronger
than
you
are
do
not
try
to
be
more
of
a
fool
than
is
absolutely
necessitated
by
the
situation
you
are
an
unusually
brazen
scoundrel
signor
magnus
again
how
these
sentimental
souls
do
seek
consolation
in
words
take
a
cigar
and
listen
to
me
i
have
long
needed
money
a
great
deal
of
money
in
my
past
which
i
need
not
disclose
to
you
i
have
suffered
certain
failures
they
irritated
me
considerably
fools
and
sentimental
souls
you
understand
my
energy
was
imprisoned
under
lock
and
key
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
for
three
years
i
sat
in
this
cursed
cage
awaiting
my
chance
and
all
that
in
the
beautiful
campagna
yes
in
the
beautiful
campagna
and
i
had
already
begun
to
lose
hope
when
you
appeared
i
find
it
difficult
to
express
myself
at
this
point
be
as
direct
as
you
can
have
no
compunctions
you
seemed
very
strange
with
all
this
love
of
yours
for
men
and
your
as
you
finally
termed
it
and
my
friend
for
a
long
time
i
had
grave
doubts
as
to
what
you
really
were
an
extraordinary
fool
or
just
a
scoundrel
like
myself
you
see
such
extraordinary
asses
appear
so
seldom
that
even
i
had
my
doubts
you
are
not
angry
oh
not
at
all
you
forced
money
upon
me
and
i
thought
a
trap
however
you
made
your
moves
quickly
and
certain
precautions
on
my
part
pardon
me
for
interrupting
so
those
books
of
yours
your
solitary
contemplation
of
life
that
little
white
house
and
everything
was
all
a
lie
and
murder
do
you
remember
all
that
drivel
about
hands
steeped
in
blood
yes
i
did
kill
that
is
true
and
i
have
pondered
much
upon
life
while
awaiting
you
but
the
rest
of
course
was
falsehood
very
base
falsehood
but
you
were
so
credulous
maria
i
confess
that
i
had
hardly
uttered
this
name
when
i
felt
something
clutching
at
my
throat
magnus
looked
at
me
sharply
and
said
gloomily
we
will
discuss
maria
too
but
how
excited
you
are
even
your
nails
have
turned
blue
perhaps
you
have
some
wine
well
never
mind
have
patience
i
shall
continue
when
you
began
your
affair
with
maria
of
course
with
my
slight
assistance
i
finally
concluded
that
you
were
an
extraordinary
ass
magnus
raised
his
hand
in
a
consoling
gesture
oh
no
you
seemed
to
me
to
be
that
at
the
beginning
i
will
tell
you
quite
truthfully
as
i
do
everything
i
am
telling
you
now
you
are
not
a
fool
at
all
wondergood
i
have
grown
to
know
you
more
intimately
it
does
matter
that
you
have
so
naïvely
surrendered
your
billions
to
me
many
wise
men
have
been
fooled
before
by
clever
scoundrels
your
misfortune
is
quite
another
thing
i
had
the
strength
to
smile
my
love
for
human
beings
no
my
friend
your
contempt
for
human
beings
your
and
at
the
same
time
your
naïve
faith
in
them
arising
from
it
you
regard
human
beings
so
far
below
you
you
are
so
convinced
of
their
fatal
powerlessness
that
you
do
not
fear
them
at
all
and
are
quite
ready
to
pat
the
rattlesnake
head
such
a
nice
little
rattlesnake
one
should
fear
people
comrade
i
know
your
but
at
times
you
were
quite
sincere
in
your
prattle
about
man
you
even
pitied
him
but
from
an
elevation
or
from
a
sidetrack
i
know
not
which
oh
if
you
could
only
hate
people
i
would
take
you
along
with
me
with
pleasure
but
you
are
an
egotist
a
terrible
egotist
wondergood
and
i
am
even
beginning
to
shed
my
regrets
for
having
robbed
you
when
i
think
of
that
whence
comes
this
base
contempt
of
yours
i
am
still
only
learning
to
be
a
man
well
go
on
learning
but
why
do
you
call
your
professor
a
scoundrel
for
i
am
your
professor
wondergood
to
the
devil
with
this
prattle
so
you
do
not
intend
to
take
me
along
with
you
no
my
friend
i
do
not
so
only
my
billions
very
well
but
what
about
your
plan
to
blow
up
the
earth
or
something
of
that
kind
or
did
you
lie
on
this
point
too
i
can
not
believe
that
you
simply
intend
to
open
a
money
changer
bureau
or
become
some
ragged
king
magnus
looked
at
me
gloomily
there
was
even
a
gleam
of
sympathy
in
his
eyes
as
he
replied
slowly
no
on
that
point
i
did
not
lie
but
you
wo
do
for
me
you
would
always
be
hanging
on
to
my
coat
tails
just
now
you
shouted
liar
scoundrel
thief
it
strange
but
you
are
yet
only
learning
to
be
a
man
and
you
have
already
imbibed
so
much
pettiness
when
i
shall
raise
my
hand
to
strike
some
one
your
contempt
will
begin
to
whine
do
strike
leave
him
alone
have
pity
oh
if
you
could
only
hate
no
you
are
a
terrible
egotist
old
man
i
shouted
the
devil
take
you
with
your
harping
on
this
egotism
i
am
not
in
the
least
more
stupid
than
you
you
beast
and
i
can
not
understand
what
you
find
so
saintly
in
hatred
magnus
frowned
first
of
all
do
shout
or
i
throw
you
out
do
you
hear
yes
perhaps
you
are
no
more
stupid
than
i
am
but
man
business
is
not
your
business
do
you
realize
that
you
beast
in
blowing
up
things
i
only
intend
to
do
business
and
you
want
to
be
the
ruler
of
another
plant
let
them
steal
and
break
down
the
machinery
and
you
you
will
be
concerned
only
about
your
salary
and
the
respect
due
you
and
i
i
wo
stand
that
all
this
he
swept
the
room
with
a
broad
gesture
is
my
plant
do
you
hear
and
it
is
i
who
will
be
robbed
i
will
be
robbed
and
injured
and
i
hate
those
who
rob
me
what
would
you
have
done
in
the
long
run
with
your
billions
if
i
had
not
taken
them
from
you
built
conservatories
and
raised
heirs
for
the
perpetuation
of
your
kind
private
yachts
and
diamonds
for
your
wife
and
i
give
me
all
the
gold
on
earth
and
i
will
throw
it
all
into
the
flames
of
my
hatred
and
all
because
i
have
been
insulted
when
you
see
a
hunchback
you
throw
him
a
lire
so
that
he
may
continue
to
bear
his
hump
yes
and
i
want
to
destroy
him
to
kill
him
to
burn
him
like
a
crooked
log
to
whom
do
you
appeal
when
you
are
fooled
or
when
a
dog
bites
your
finger
to
your
wife
the
police
public
opinion
but
suppose
the
wife
with
the
aid
of
your
butler
plants
horns
on
your
head
or
public
opinion
fails
to
understand
you
and
instead
of
pitying
you
prefers
to
give
you
a
thrashing
then
do
you
make
your
appeal
to
god
but
i
i
go
to
no
one
i
plead
before
no
one
but
neither
do
i
forgive
you
understand
i
do
not
forgive
only
egotists
forgive
i
consider
myself
personally
insulted
i
heard
him
in
silence
perhaps
it
was
because
i
was
so
close
to
the
fireplace
gazing
into
the
fire
and
listening
to
magnus
words
each
new
word
intermingled
with
a
fresh
blaze
of
a
burning
log
no
sooner
would
the
glowing
red
mass
fall
apart
than
the
words
too
would
break
up
into
particles
like
hot
coals
my
head
was
not
at
all
clear
and
under
the
influence
of
these
burning
flaming
flying
words
i
fell
into
a
strange
dark
drowsiness
but
this
was
what
my
memory
retained
oh
if
you
could
only
hate
if
you
were
not
so
cowardly
and
weak
of
soul
i
would
take
you
with
me
and
would
let
you
behold
a
fire
which
would
forever
dry
your
miserable
tears
and
burn
your
sentimental
dreams
to
ashes
do
you
hear
the
song
of
the
fools
of
the
world
they
are
merely
loading
the
cannons
the
wise
man
need
only
apply
the
fire
to
the
fuse
you
understand
could
you
behold
calmly
the
sight
of
a
blissful
sheep
and
hungry
snake
lying
together
separated
only
by
a
thin
partition
i
could
not
i
would
drill
just
a
little
opening
a
little
opening
the
rest
they
would
do
themselves
do
you
know
that
from
the
union
of
truth
and
falsehood
comes
an
explosion
i
want
to
unite
i
shall
do
nothing
myself
i
shall
only
what
they
have
begun
do
you
hear
how
merrily
they
sing
i
will
make
them
dance
too
come
with
me
comrade
you
sought
some
sort
of
a
play
let
me
give
you
an
extraordinary
spectacle
we
shall
bring
the
whole
earth
into
action
and
millions
of
marionettes
will
begin
to
caper
obediently
at
our
command
you
know
not
yet
how
talented
and
obliging
they
are
it
will
be
a
splendid
play
and
will
give
you
much
pleasure
and
amusement
a
large
log
fell
apart
and
split
into
many
sparks
and
hot
cinders
the
flame
subsided
growing
morose
and
red
a
silent
heat
emanated
from
the
dimmed
hearth
it
burned
my
face
and
suddenly
there
arose
before
me
my
puppets
show
the
heat
and
fire
had
conjured
up
a
mirage
i
seemed
to
hear
the
crash
of
drums
and
the
gay
ring
of
cymbals
while
the
merry
clown
turned
on
his
head
at
the
sight
of
the
broken
skulls
of
the
dolls
the
broken
heads
continued
to
pile
up
then
i
saw
the
scrap
heap
with
two
motionless
little
legs
protruding
from
the
heap
of
rubbish
they
wore
rose
slippers
and
the
drums
continued
beating
and
i
said
pensively
i
think
it
will
hurt
them
and
behind
my
back
rang
out
the
contemptuous
and
indifferent
reply
quite
possibly
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
wondergood
but
i
can
not
ca
you
see
i
can
not
permit
every
miserable
biped
to
call
himself
a
man
there
are
too
many
of
them
already
they
multiply
like
rabbits
under
the
stimulus
of
physicians
and
laws
death
deceived
can
not
handle
them
all
it
is
confused
and
seems
to
have
lost
its
dignity
and
moral
authority
it
is
wasting
its
time
in
dancing
halls
i
hate
them
it
has
become
repulsive
to
me
to
walk
upon
this
earth
fallen
into
the
power
of
a
strange
strange
species
we
must
suspend
the
law
at
least
temporarily
and
let
death
have
its
fling
however
they
themselves
will
see
to
this
no
not
i
but
they
will
do
it
think
not
that
i
am
particularly
cruel
no
i
am
only
logical
i
am
only
the
conclusion
the
symbol
of
equality
the
sum
total
the
line
beneath
the
column
of
figures
you
may
call
it
ergo
magnus
ergo
they
say
and
and
i
reply
exactly
four
imagine
that
the
world
has
suddenly
grown
cold
and
immovable
for
a
moment
and
you
behold
some
such
picture
here
is
a
free
and
careless
head
and
above
it
a
suspended
axe
here
is
a
mass
of
powder
and
here
a
spark
about
to
fall
upon
it
but
it
has
stopped
and
does
not
fall
here
is
a
heavy
structure
set
upon
a
single
undermined
foundation
but
everything
has
grown
rigid
and
the
foundation
holds
here
is
a
breast
and
here
a
hand
aiming
a
bullet
at
it
have
i
prepared
all
this
i
merely
touch
the
lever
and
press
it
down
the
axe
falls
upon
the
laughing
head
and
crushes
it
the
spark
falls
into
the
powder
all
is
off
the
building
crashes
to
the
ground
the
bullet
pierces
the
ready
breast
and
i
i
have
merely
touched
the
lever
i
magnus
ergo
think
would
i
be
able
to
kill
had
i
at
my
disposal
only
violins
or
other
musical
instruments
i
laughed
only
violins
magnus
replied
with
laughter
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
heavy
but
they
have
other
instruments
too
and
i
will
use
these
instruments
see
how
simple
and
interesting
all
this
is
and
what
further
magnus
ergo
how
do
i
know
what
to
follow
i
see
only
page
and
solve
only
problem
i
know
not
what
the
next
page
contains
perhaps
it
contains
the
same
thing
perhaps
it
does
and
perhaps
this
is
the
final
page
well
what
of
that
the
sum
total
remains
as
is
necessary
you
spoke
on
one
occasion
about
yes
that
is
my
lever
you
remember
what
i
told
you
explosive
i
promise
rabbits
to
make
lions
of
them
you
see
a
rabbit
can
not
stand
brains
give
a
rabbit
brains
and
he
will
hang
himself
melancholy
will
drive
him
to
suicide
brains
implies
logic
and
what
can
promise
to
a
rabbit
nothing
but
a
sorry
fate
on
a
restaurant
menu
what
one
must
promise
a
rabbit
is
either
immortality
for
a
cheap
price
as
does
cardinal
or
heaven
on
earth
you
will
see
what
energy
what
daring
my
rabbit
will
develop
when
i
paint
before
him
on
the
wall
heavenly
powers
and
gardens
of
eden
on
the
wall
yes
on
a
stone
wall
he
will
storm
it
with
all
the
power
of
his
species
and
who
knows
who
knows
perhaps
this
mass
may
really
break
through
this
stone
wall
magnus
lapsed
into
thought
i
drew
away
from
the
now
extinguished
fire
and
looked
upon
the
explosive
head
of
my
repulsive
friend
something
naïve
like
two
little
wrinkles
almost
like
those
of
a
child
lay
upon
his
stony
brow
i
burst
into
laughter
and
shouted
thomas
magnus
thomas
ergo
do
you
believe
without
raising
his
head
as
if
he
had
not
heard
my
laughter
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
replied
pensively
we
must
try
i
continued
to
laugh
deep
wild
apparently
human
laughing
malice
began
to
rise
within
me
thomas
magnus
magnus
rabbit
do
you
believe
he
thumped
the
table
with
his
fist
and
roared
in
a
wild
transport
be
quiet
i
tell
you
we
must
try
how
do
i
know
i
have
never
yet
been
on
mars
nor
seen
this
earth
be
silent
accursed
egotist
you
know
nothing
of
our
affairs
ah
if
only
you
could
hate
i
hate
already
magnus
suddenly
laughed
and
grew
strangely
calm
he
sat
down
and
scrutinizing
me
from
all
possible
angles
as
if
he
did
not
believe
me
he
burst
out
you
hate
whom
you
he
looked
me
over
as
carefully
again
and
shook
his
head
in
doubt
is
that
true
wondergood
if
they
are
rabbits
you
are
the
most
repulsive
of
them
all
because
you
are
a
mixture
of
rabbit
and
satan
you
are
a
coward
the
fact
that
you
are
a
crook
a
thief
a
liar
a
murderer
is
not
important
but
you
are
a
coward
that
is
important
i
expected
something
more
of
you
i
hoped
your
mind
would
lift
you
above
the
greatest
crime
but
you
lift
crime
itself
into
some
base
philanthropy
you
are
as
much
of
a
lackey
as
the
others
the
only
difference
between
you
and
them
is
that
you
have
a
perverted
idea
of
service
magnus
sighed
no
that
not
it
you
understand
nothing
wondergood
and
what
you
lack
is
daring
my
friend
if
you
are
magnus
ergo
what
audacity
magnus
ergo
then
why
do
you
go
the
limit
then
i
too
would
follow
you
perhaps
will
you
really
come
and
why
should
i
not
come
let
me
be
contempt
and
you
hatred
we
can
go
together
do
not
fear
lest
i
hang
on
to
your
coat
tails
you
have
revealed
much
to
me
my
dear
putridity
and
i
shall
not
seize
your
hand
even
though
you
raise
it
against
yourself
will
you
betray
me
and
you
will
kill
me
is
that
not
enough
but
magnus
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
said
you
will
betray
me
i
am
a
living
human
being
while
you
smell
like
a
corpse
i
do
not
want
to
have
contempt
for
if
i
do
i
perish
do
you
dare
to
look
at
me
look
upon
the
others
i
laughed
very
well
i
shall
not
look
at
i
will
look
at
the
rest
i
will
make
it
easier
for
you
with
my
contempt
magnus
fell
into
prolonged
thought
then
he
looked
again
at
me
piercingly
and
quietly
asked
and
maria
oh
cursed
wretch
again
he
hurled
my
heart
upon
the
floor
i
looked
at
him
wildly
like
one
aroused
at
night
by
fire
and
three
big
waves
swept
my
breast
with
the
first
wave
rose
the
silent
violins
ah
how
they
wailed
just
as
if
the
musician
played
not
upon
strings
but
upon
my
veins
then
in
a
huge
wave
with
foamy
surf
there
rolled
by
all
the
images
thoughts
and
emotions
of
my
recent
beloved
human
state
think
of
it
everything
was
there
even
the
lizzard
that
hissed
at
my
feet
that
evening
beneath
the
moonlight
i
recalled
even
the
little
lizzard
and
with
the
third
wave
there
was
rolled
out
quietly
upon
the
shore
the
holy
name
and
just
as
quietly
it
receded
leaving
behind
a
delicate
lace
of
foam
and
from
beyond
the
sea
burst
forth
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
for
a
moment
for
one
little
moment
i
again
became
a
white
schooner
with
sails
lowered
where
were
the
stars
while
awaiting
the
word
of
the
lord
of
the
universe
to
break
forth
in
all
their
brilliance
madonna
magnus
recalled
me
quietly
where
are
you
going
she
is
not
there
what
do
you
want
pardon
me
dear
magnus
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
signorina
maria
only
for
a
moment
i
do
feel
quite
well
there
is
something
revolving
in
my
eyes
and
head
are
you
smiling
dear
magnus
or
does
it
only
seem
so
to
me
i
have
been
gazing
into
the
fire
too
long
and
i
can
hardly
discern
the
objects
before
me
did
you
say
maria
yes
i
would
like
to
see
her
then
we
shall
continue
our
interesting
conversation
you
will
remind
me
just
where
we
stopped
but
meanwhile
i
would
be
extremely
obliged
to
you
if
we
were
to
take
a
little
drive
into
the
campagna
it
is
so
sweet
there
and
signorina
maria
sit
down
you
will
see
her
presently
but
i
continued
to
weave
my
nonsense
what
in
the
devil
had
happened
to
my
head
i
prattled
on
for
a
considerable
period
and
now
the
whole
thing
seems
so
ridiculous
once
or
twice
i
pressed
the
heavy
motionless
hand
of
thomas
magnus
apparently
he
must
have
looked
like
my
father
at
that
moment
finally
i
subsided
partially
regained
my
senses
but
in
obedience
to
magnus
command
remained
in
my
chair
and
prepared
to
listen
can
you
listen
now
you
are
quite
excited
old
man
remember
the
senses
the
senses
yes
now
i
can
go
on
i
remember
everything
continue
old
friend
i
am
all
attention
yes
i
recollected
everything
but
it
was
quite
immaterial
to
me
just
what
magnus
said
or
what
he
might
say
i
was
awaiting
maria
that
is
how
strong
my
love
was
turning
aside
for
some
reason
and
beating
time
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
magnus
said
slowly
and
rather
reluctantly
listen
wondergood
in
reality
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
for
me
to
throw
you
out
into
the
street
you
and
your
idiotic
toppi
you
wanted
to
experience
human
life
and
i
would
have
viewed
with
pleasure
any
efforts
on
your
part
to
earn
your
own
bread
you
are
apparently
no
longer
used
to
this
it
would
also
have
been
very
interesting
to
know
what
would
become
of
your
grandiose
contempt
when
but
i
am
not
angry
strange
to
say
i
even
nurse
a
feeling
of
thankfulness
for
your
billions
and
i
am
rather
hopeful
yes
i
still
have
a
little
hope
that
some
day
you
may
really
grow
to
be
a
man
and
while
this
may
prove
an
impediment
to
me
i
am
ready
to
take
you
with
me
but
only
after
a
certain
test
are
you
still
anxious
to
have
maria
yes
very
well
magnus
rose
with
effort
and
moved
toward
the
door
but
he
halted
for
a
moment
and
turned
toward
me
and
surprising
as
it
was
on
the
part
of
this
scoundrel
he
kissed
my
brow
sit
down
old
man
i
will
call
her
immediately
the
servants
are
all
out
he
uttered
the
last
sentence
as
he
knocked
feebly
at
the
door
the
head
of
one
of
his
appeared
for
a
moment
and
immediately
withdrew
with
apparently
the
same
effort
magnus
returned
to
his
place
and
said
with
a
sigh
she
will
be
here
at
once
we
were
silent
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
tall
door
and
it
opened
wide
entered
with
a
quick
step
i
moved
to
greet
her
and
bowed
low
magnus
shouted
do
kiss
that
hand
may
i
could
not
continue
these
notes
yesterday
do
not
laugh
this
mere
combination
of
words
do
not
kiss
that
hand
seemed
to
me
the
most
terrible
utterance
the
human
tongue
was
capable
of
it
acted
upon
me
like
a
magic
curse
when
i
recall
those
words
now
they
everything
i
do
and
befog
my
whole
being
transporting
me
into
a
new
state
if
i
happen
to
be
speaking
i
grow
silent
as
if
suddenly
stricken
dumb
if
i
happen
to
be
walking
i
halt
if
standing
i
run
if
i
happen
to
be
asleep
no
matter
how
deep
my
slumber
i
awake
and
can
not
fall
asleep
again
very
simple
extremely
simple
words
do
not
kiss
that
hand
and
now
listen
to
what
happened
further
and
so
i
bowed
over
hand
but
so
strange
and
sudden
was
magnus
cry
so
great
was
the
command
in
his
hoarse
voice
that
it
was
impossible
to
disobey
it
was
as
if
he
had
stopped
a
blind
man
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
i
failed
to
grasp
his
meaning
and
raised
my
head
in
perplexity
still
holding
maria
hand
in
mine
and
looked
at
magnus
he
was
breathing
heavily
as
if
he
had
actually
witnessed
my
fall
into
the
abyss
and
in
reply
to
my
questioning
look
he
said
in
a
stifled
tone
let
her
hand
alone
maria
get
away
from
him
maria
released
her
hand
and
stepped
aside
at
a
distance
from
me
still
perplexed
i
watched
her
standing
alone
i
tried
to
grasp
the
situation
for
a
brief
moment
it
seemed
even
extremely
ludicrous
and
reminded
me
of
a
scene
in
a
comedy
in
which
the
angry
father
comes
unexpectedly
upon
the
sweethearts
but
my
silly
laughter
died
away
immediately
and
in
obedient
expectation
i
raised
my
eyes
to
magnus
magnus
hesitated
rising
with
an
effort
he
twice
paced
the
length
of
the
room
and
halting
before
me
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
said
with
all
your
eccentricities
you
a
decent
man
wondergood
i
have
you
that
was
how
he
put
it
but
i
can
no
longer
permit
you
to
kiss
the
hand
of
this
woman
listen
listen
i
have
already
told
you
you
must
change
your
outlook
upon
men
i
know
it
is
very
difficult
and
i
sympathize
with
you
but
it
is
essential
that
you
do
it
old
friend
listen
listen
i
misled
you
maria
is
not
my
daughter
i
have
no
children
neither
is
she
a
madonna
she
is
my
mistress
and
she
was
that
as
recently
as
last
night
now
i
understand
that
magnus
was
merciful
in
his
own
way
and
was
intentionally
submerging
me
slowly
into
darkness
but
at
that
time
i
did
not
realize
this
and
stifling
my
breath
gradually
dying
i
lost
consciousness
and
when
with
magnus
last
words
the
light
fled
from
me
and
impenetrable
night
enveloped
my
being
i
whipped
out
my
revolver
and
fired
at
magnus
several
times
in
succession
i
do
not
know
how
many
shots
i
fired
i
remember
only
a
series
of
laughing
flickering
flames
and
the
movements
of
my
hand
pushing
the
weapon
forward
i
can
not
remember
at
all
how
and
when
his
rushed
in
and
disarmed
me
when
i
regained
my
senses
this
was
the
picture
i
saw
the
were
gone
i
was
sitting
deep
in
my
chair
before
the
dark
fireplace
my
hair
was
wet
while
above
my
left
eyebrow
there
was
a
bandage
soaked
in
blood
my
collar
was
gone
and
my
shirt
was
torn
my
left
sleeve
was
almost
entirely
torn
off
so
that
i
had
to
keep
jerking
it
up
constantly
maria
stood
on
the
same
spot
in
the
same
pose
as
if
she
had
not
moved
at
all
during
the
struggle
i
was
surprised
to
see
toppi
who
sat
in
a
corner
and
gazed
at
me
strangely
at
the
table
with
his
back
to
me
stood
magnus
he
was
pouring
out
some
wine
for
himself
when
i
heaved
a
particularly
deep
sigh
magnus
turned
quickly
and
said
in
a
strangely
familiar
tone
do
you
want
some
wine
wondergood
you
may
have
a
glass
now
here
drink
you
see
you
failed
to
hit
me
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
not
but
i
am
alive
to
your
health
old
man
i
touched
my
brow
with
my
finger
and
mumbled
blood
a
mere
trifle
just
a
little
scratch
it
wo
matter
do
touch
it
it
smells
with
powder
yes
that
soon
pass
too
toppi
is
here
do
you
see
him
he
asked
permission
to
stay
here
you
wo
object
if
your
secretary
remains
while
we
continue
our
conversation
he
is
extremely
devoted
to
you
i
looked
at
toppi
and
smiled
toppi
made
a
grimace
and
sighed
gently
wondergood
it
is
i
your
toppi
and
he
burst
into
tears
this
old
devil
still
emitting
the
odor
of
fur
this
old
clown
in
black
this
sexton
with
hanging
nose
this
seducer
of
little
girls
burst
into
tears
but
still
worse
was
it
when
blinking
my
eyes
i
too
began
to
weep
i
the
wise
immortal
almighty
thus
we
both
wept
two
deceived
devils
who
happened
to
drop
in
upon
this
earth
and
human
beings
i
am
happy
to
give
them
their
due
looked
on
with
deep
sympathy
for
our
tears
weeping
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
i
asked
it
difficult
to
be
a
man
toppi
and
toppi
sobbing
replied
obediently
very
difficult
mr
wondergood
but
here
i
happened
to
look
at
maria
and
my
sentimental
tears
immediately
dried
in
general
that
evening
is
memorable
for
the
sudden
and
ludicrous
transformations
of
my
moods
you
probably
know
them
old
man
now
i
wept
and
beat
the
lyre
like
a
weeping
post
now
i
became
permeated
with
a
stony
calm
and
a
sense
of
unconquerable
power
or
i
began
to
chatter
nonsense
like
a
parrot
scared
to
death
by
a
dog
and
kept
up
my
chatter
louder
sillier
and
more
and
more
unbearable
until
a
new
mood
bore
me
off
into
a
deep
and
inexpressible
sadness
magnus
caught
my
look
at
maria
and
smiled
involuntarily
i
adjusted
the
collar
of
my
torn
shirt
and
said
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
that
i
failed
to
kill
you
old
friend
i
am
quite
calm
now
however
and
would
like
you
to
tell
me
everything
about
that
woman
but
as
you
are
a
liar
let
me
question
her
first
signorina
maria
you
were
my
bride
and
in
a
few
days
i
hoped
to
call
you
my
wife
but
tell
me
the
truth
are
you
really
this
man
mistress
yes
signor
and
how
long
five
years
signor
and
how
old
are
you
now
nineteen
signor
that
means
you
were
fourteen
now
you
may
continue
magnus
oh
my
god
it
was
toppi
who
exclaimed
sit
down
as
you
see
wondergood
began
magnus
in
a
dry
and
calm
tone
as
if
he
were
demonstrating
not
himself
but
some
sort
of
a
chemical
compound
this
mistress
of
mine
is
quite
an
extraordinary
phenomenon
with
all
her
unusual
resemblance
to
the
madonna
capable
of
deceiving
men
better
versed
than
you
or
i
in
religion
with
all
her
really
unearthly
beauty
chastity
and
charm
she
is
a
licentious
and
quite
shameless
creature
ready
to
sell
herself
from
head
to
foot
magnus
calm
yourself
you
see
how
she
listens
to
me
even
your
old
toppi
is
cringing
and
blushing
while
she
her
gaze
is
clear
and
all
her
features
are
filled
with
placid
harmony
did
you
notice
how
clear
maria
gaze
is
do
you
hear
me
yes
certainly
would
you
like
wine
or
an
orange
take
it
there
it
is
on
the
table
incidentally
observe
her
graceful
walk
she
seems
to
be
always
stepping
lightly
as
if
on
flowers
or
clouds
what
extraordinary
beauty
and
litheness
as
an
old
lover
of
hers
i
may
also
add
the
following
detail
which
you
have
not
learned
yet
she
herself
her
body
has
the
fragrance
of
some
flowers
now
as
to
her
spiritual
qualities
as
the
psychologists
put
it
if
i
were
to
speak
of
them
in
ordinary
language
i
would
say
she
was
as
stupid
as
a
goose
quite
a
hopeless
fool
but
she
is
cunning
and
a
liar
very
avaricious
as
regards
money
but
she
likes
it
only
in
gold
everything
she
told
you
she
learned
from
me
memorizing
the
more
difficult
lines
and
i
had
quite
a
task
in
teaching
her
but
i
feared
all
the
time
that
despite
your
love
you
would
be
struck
by
her
apparent
lack
of
brains
and
that
is
why
i
kept
her
from
you
the
last
few
days
toppi
sobbed
oh
god
madonna
does
this
astonish
you
mr
toppi
magnus
asked
turning
his
head
i
dare
say
you
are
not
alone
do
you
remember
wondergood
what
i
told
you
about
maria
resemblance
which
drove
one
young
man
to
suicide
i
did
not
lie
to
you
altogether
the
youth
actually
did
kill
himself
when
he
realized
who
maria
really
was
he
was
pure
of
soul
he
loved
as
you
do
and
as
you
he
could
not
bear
how
do
you
put
it
the
wreck
of
his
ideal
magnus
laughed
do
you
remember
giovanni
maria
slightly
do
you
hear
wondergood
asked
magnus
laughing
that
is
exactly
the
tone
in
which
she
would
have
spoken
of
me
a
week
hence
if
you
had
killed
me
have
another
orange
maria
but
if
i
were
to
speak
of
maria
in
extraordinary
language
she
is
not
at
all
stupid
she
simply
does
happen
to
have
what
is
called
a
soul
i
have
frequently
tried
to
look
deep
into
her
heart
and
thoughts
and
i
have
always
ended
in
vertigo
as
if
i
had
been
hurled
to
the
edge
of
an
abyss
there
was
there
emptiness
you
have
probably
observed
wondergood
or
you
toppi
that
ice
is
not
as
cold
as
the
brow
of
a
man
and
no
matter
what
emptiness
familiar
to
you
you
may
imagine
my
friends
it
can
not
be
compared
with
that
absolute
vacuum
which
forms
the
kernel
of
my
beautiful
star
star
of
the
seas
that
was
what
you
once
called
her
wondergood
was
it
not
magnus
laughed
again
and
gulped
down
a
glass
of
wine
he
drank
a
great
deal
that
evening
will
you
have
some
wine
toppi
no
well
suit
yourself
take
some
so
that
is
why
wondergood
i
did
not
want
you
to
kiss
the
hand
of
that
creature
do
turn
your
eyes
away
old
friend
imagine
you
are
in
a
museum
and
look
straight
at
her
bravely
did
you
wish
to
say
something
toppi
yes
signor
magnus
pardon
me
wondergood
but
i
would
like
to
ask
your
permission
to
leave
as
a
gentleman
although
not
much
of
that
i
can
not
remain
at
magnus
narrowed
his
eyes
derisively
at
such
a
scene
yes
at
such
a
scene
when
one
gentleman
with
the
silent
approval
of
another
gentleman
insults
a
woman
like
exclaimed
toppi
extremely
irritated
and
rose
magnus
just
as
ironically
turned
to
me
and
what
do
you
say
wondergood
shall
we
release
this
little
extremely
little
gentleman
stay
toppi
toppi
sat
down
obediently
from
the
moment
magnus
resumed
i
for
the
first
time
regained
my
breath
and
looked
at
maria
what
shall
i
say
to
you
it
was
and
here
i
understood
a
little
happens
in
one
brain
when
one
begins
to
go
mad
may
i
continue
asked
magnus
however
i
have
little
to
add
yes
i
took
her
when
she
was
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
she
herself
does
not
know
how
old
she
really
is
but
i
was
not
her
first
lover
nor
the
tenth
i
could
never
learn
her
past
exactly
she
either
lies
cunningly
or
is
actually
devoid
of
memory
but
even
the
most
subtle
questioning
which
even
a
most
expert
criminal
could
not
dodge
neither
bribes
nor
gifts
nor
threats
and
she
is
extremely
cowardly
could
compel
her
to
reveal
herself
she
does
not
that
all
but
her
deep
licentiousness
enough
to
shame
the
sultan
himself
her
extraordinary
experience
and
daring
in
ars
amandi
confirms
my
suspicion
that
she
received
her
training
in
a
lupanaria
or
or
at
the
court
of
some
nero
i
do
not
know
how
old
she
is
and
she
seems
to
change
constantly
why
should
i
not
say
that
she
is
or
years
old
maria
you
can
do
everything
and
you
know
everything
i
did
not
look
at
that
woman
but
in
her
answer
there
was
a
slight
displeasure
do
talk
nonsense
what
will
wondergood
think
of
me
magnus
broke
into
loud
laughter
and
struck
the
table
with
his
glass
do
you
hear
wondergood
she
covets
your
good
opinion
and
if
i
should
command
her
to
undress
at
once
in
your
presence
oh
my
god
my
god
sobbed
toppi
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
glanced
quickly
into
magnus
eyes
and
remained
rigid
in
the
terrible
enchantment
of
his
gaze
his
face
was
laughing
this
pale
mask
of
his
was
still
lined
with
traces
of
faint
laughter
but
the
eyes
were
dim
and
inscrutable
directed
upon
me
they
stared
off
somewhere
into
the
distance
and
were
horrible
in
their
expression
of
dark
and
madness
only
the
empty
orbits
of
a
skull
could
gaze
so
threateningly
and
in
such
wrath
and
again
darkness
filled
my
head
and
when
i
regained
my
senses
magnus
had
already
turned
and
calmly
sipped
his
wine
without
changing
his
position
he
raised
his
glass
to
the
light
smelled
the
wine
sipped
some
more
of
it
and
said
as
calmly
as
before
and
so
wondergood
my
friend
now
you
know
about
all
there
is
to
know
of
maria
or
the
madonna
as
you
called
her
and
i
ask
you
will
you
take
her
or
not
i
give
her
away
take
her
if
you
say
yes
she
will
be
in
your
bedroom
and
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
you
will
pass
a
very
pleasant
night
well
what
do
you
say
yesterday
you
and
i
yesterday
i
you
he
smiled
what
kind
of
man
are
you
wondergood
to
speak
of
such
trifles
or
are
you
used
to
having
some
one
else
warm
your
bed
take
her
she
is
a
fine
girl
whom
are
you
torturing
magnus
me
or
yourself
magnus
looked
at
me
ironically
what
a
wise
boy
of
course
myself
you
are
a
very
clever
american
wondergood
and
i
wonder
why
your
career
has
been
so
mediocre
go
to
bed
dear
children
good
night
what
are
you
looking
at
wondergood
do
you
find
the
hour
too
early
if
so
take
her
out
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
when
you
see
maria
beneath
the
moonlight
magnuses
will
be
unable
to
prove
that
this
heavenly
maiden
is
the
same
creature
who
i
flared
up
you
are
a
disgusting
scoundrel
and
liar
thomas
magnus
if
she
has
received
her
training
in
a
lupanaria
then
you
my
worthy
signor
must
have
received
your
higher
education
in
the
penitentiary
whence
comes
that
aroma
which
permeates
so
thoroughly
your
gentlemanly
jokes
and
witticisms
the
sight
of
your
pale
face
is
beginning
to
nauseate
me
after
enticing
a
woman
in
the
fashion
of
a
petty
common
hero
magnus
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
aflame
silence
you
are
an
inconceivable
ass
wondergood
do
you
understand
that
i
myself
like
you
was
deceived
by
her
who
meeting
can
escape
deception
oh
devil
what
are
the
sufferings
of
your
little
shallow
american
soul
in
comparison
with
the
pangs
of
mine
oh
devil
witticism
jests
gentlemen
and
ladies
asses
and
tigers
gods
and
devils
ca
you
see
this
is
not
a
woman
this
is
an
eagle
who
daily
plucks
my
liver
my
suffering
begins
in
the
morning
each
morning
oblivious
to
what
passed
the
day
before
i
see
madonna
before
me
and
believe
i
think
what
happened
to
me
yesterday
apparently
i
must
be
mistaken
or
did
i
miss
anything
it
is
impossible
that
this
clear
gaze
this
divine
walk
this
pure
countenance
of
madonna
should
belong
to
a
prostitute
it
is
your
soul
that
is
vile
thomas
magnus
she
is
as
pure
as
a
host
and
there
were
occasions
when
on
my
knees
i
actually
begged
forgiveness
of
this
creature
can
you
imagine
it
on
my
knees
then
it
was
that
i
was
really
a
scoundrel
wondergood
i
idealized
her
endowed
her
with
my
thoughts
and
feelings
and
was
overjoyed
like
an
idiot
i
almost
wept
with
felicity
when
she
mumblingly
repeated
what
i
would
say
like
a
high
priest
i
painted
my
idol
and
then
knelt
before
it
in
intoxication
but
the
truth
proved
stronger
at
last
with
each
moment
with
each
hour
falsehood
slipped
off
her
body
so
that
toward
night
i
even
beat
her
i
beat
her
and
wept
i
beat
her
cruelly
as
does
a
procurer
his
mistress
and
then
came
night
with
its
babylonian
licentiousness
the
sleep
of
the
dead
and
oblivion
and
then
morning
again
and
again
madonna
and
again
oh
devil
over
night
my
faith
again
grew
as
did
the
liver
of
prometheus
and
like
a
bird
of
prey
she
tortured
me
all
day
i
too
am
human
wondergood
shivering
as
if
with
cold
magnus
began
to
pace
the
room
rapidly
gazed
into
the
dark
fireplace
and
approached
maria
maria
lifted
her
clear
gaze
to
him
as
if
in
question
while
magnus
stroked
her
head
carefully
and
gently
as
he
would
that
of
a
parrot
or
a
cat
what
a
little
head
what
a
sweet
little
head
wondergood
come
caress
it
i
drew
up
my
torn
sleeve
and
asked
ironically
and
it
is
this
bird
of
prey
that
you
now
wish
to
give
to
me
have
you
exhausted
your
feed
you
want
my
liver
too
in
addition
to
my
billions
but
magnus
had
already
calmed
himself
subduing
his
excitement
and
the
drunkenness
which
had
imperceptibly
come
upon
him
he
returned
to
his
place
without
haste
and
ordered
politely
i
will
answer
you
in
a
moment
wondergood
please
withdraw
to
your
room
maria
i
have
something
to
say
to
wondergood
and
i
would
ask
you
too
my
honorable
toppi
to
depart
you
may
join
my
friends
in
the
salon
if
wondergood
will
so
command
replied
toppi
dryly
without
rising
i
nodded
and
without
looking
at
magnus
my
secretary
obediently
made
his
exit
maria
too
left
the
room
to
tell
the
truth
i
again
felt
like
clinging
to
his
vest
and
weeping
in
the
first
few
moments
of
my
with
magnus
after
all
this
thief
was
my
friend
but
i
satisfied
myself
with
merely
swallowing
my
tears
then
followed
a
moment
of
brief
desperation
at
the
of
maria
and
slowly
as
if
from
the
realm
of
remote
recollection
blind
and
wild
anger
and
the
need
of
beating
and
destroying
began
to
fill
my
heart
let
me
add
too
that
i
was
extremely
provoked
by
my
torn
sleeve
that
kept
slipping
constantly
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
stern
and
austere
and
this
made
me
seem
ridiculous
ah
on
what
trifles
does
the
result
of
the
greatest
events
depend
on
this
earth
i
lighted
a
cigar
and
with
studied
gruffness
hurled
into
the
calm
and
hateful
face
of
magnus
now
you
enough
of
comedy
and
charlatanism
tell
me
what
you
want
so
you
want
me
to
surrender
to
that
bird
of
prey
of
yours
magnus
replied
calmly
although
his
eyes
were
burning
with
anger
yes
that
is
the
trial
i
wanted
to
subject
you
to
wondergood
i
fear
that
i
have
succumbed
slightly
to
the
emotion
of
useless
and
vain
revenge
and
spoke
more
heatedly
than
was
necessary
in
maria
presence
the
thing
is
wondergood
that
all
that
i
have
so
picturesquely
described
to
you
all
this
passion
and
despair
and
all
these
sufferings
of
prometheus
really
belong
to
the
past
i
now
look
upon
maria
without
pain
and
even
with
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
as
upon
a
beautiful
and
useful
little
beast
useful
for
domestic
considerations
you
understand
what
after
all
is
the
liver
of
prometheus
it
is
all
nonsense
in
reality
i
should
be
thankful
to
maria
she
gnawed
out
with
her
little
teeth
my
silly
and
gave
me
that
clear
firm
and
realistic
outlook
upon
life
which
permits
of
no
deceptions
and
sentimentalisms
you
too
ought
to
experience
and
grasp
it
wondergood
if
you
would
follow
magnus
ergo
i
remained
silent
lazily
chewing
my
cigar
magnus
lowered
his
eyes
and
continued
still
more
calmly
and
dryly
desert
pilgrims
to
accustom
themselves
to
death
used
to
sleep
in
coffins
let
maria
be
your
coffin
and
when
you
feel
like
going
to
church
kissing
a
woman
and
stretching
your
hand
to
a
friend
just
look
at
maria
and
her
thomas
magnus
take
her
wondergood
and
you
will
soon
convince
yourself
of
the
value
of
my
gift
i
need
her
any
longer
and
when
your
humiliated
soul
shall
become
inflamed
with
truly
inextinguishable
human
hatred
and
not
with
weak
contempt
come
to
me
and
i
shall
welcome
you
into
the
ranks
of
my
yeomanry
which
will
very
soon
are
you
hesitating
well
then
go
catch
other
lies
but
be
careful
to
avoid
scoundrels
and
madonnas
my
gentleman
from
illinois
he
broke
into
loud
laughter
and
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
at
one
gulp
his
swollen
calm
evaporated
little
flames
of
intoxication
now
merry
now
ludicrous
like
the
lights
of
a
carnival
now
triumphant
now
dim
like
funeral
torches
at
a
grave
again
sprang
forth
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
the
scoundrel
was
drunk
but
held
himself
firmly
merely
swaying
his
branches
like
an
oak
before
a
south
wind
rising
and
facing
me
he
straightened
his
body
cynically
as
if
trying
to
reveal
himself
in
his
entirety
and
well
nigh
spat
these
words
at
me
well
how
long
do
you
intend
to
think
about
it
you
ass
come
quick
or
i
kick
you
out
quick
i
tired
of
you
what
the
use
of
my
wasting
words
what
are
you
thinking
of
my
head
buzzed
madly
pulling
up
that
accursed
sleeve
of
mine
i
replied
i
am
thinking
that
you
are
an
evil
contemptible
stupid
and
repulsive
beast
i
am
thinking
in
what
springs
of
life
or
hell
itself
i
could
find
for
you
the
punishment
you
deserve
yes
i
came
upon
this
earth
to
play
and
to
laugh
yes
i
myself
was
ready
to
embrace
any
evil
i
myself
lied
and
pretended
but
you
hairy
worm
you
crawled
into
my
very
heart
and
bit
me
you
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
my
heart
was
human
and
bit
me
you
hairy
worm
how
dared
you
deceive
me
i
will
punish
you
you
me
i
am
glad
to
say
that
magnus
was
astonished
and
taken
aback
his
eyes
widened
and
grew
round
and
his
open
mouth
naïvely
displayed
a
set
of
white
teeth
breathing
with
difficulty
he
repeated
you
me
yes
i
you
police
you
are
not
afraid
of
it
very
well
let
all
your
courts
be
powerless
remain
unpunished
on
this
earth
you
evil
conscienceless
creature
the
day
will
come
when
the
sea
of
falsehood
which
constitutes
your
life
will
part
and
all
your
falsehood
too
will
give
way
and
disappear
let
there
be
no
foot
upon
this
earth
to
crush
you
hairy
worm
let
i
too
am
powerless
here
but
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
depart
from
this
earth
and
when
you
come
to
and
fall
under
the
shadow
of
my
kingdom
your
kingdom
hold
on
wondergood
who
are
you
then
and
right
at
this
point
there
occurred
the
most
shameful
event
of
my
entire
earthly
life
tell
me
is
it
not
ridiculously
funny
when
satan
even
in
human
form
bends
his
knee
in
prayer
to
a
prostitute
and
is
stripped
naked
by
the
very
first
man
he
meets
yes
this
is
extremely
ridiculous
and
shameful
of
satan
who
bears
with
him
the
breath
of
eternity
but
what
would
you
say
of
satan
when
he
turned
into
a
powerless
and
pitiful
liar
and
pasted
upon
his
head
with
a
great
flourish
the
paper
crown
of
a
theatrical
czar
i
am
ashamed
old
man
give
me
one
of
your
blows
the
kind
on
which
you
feed
your
friends
and
hired
clowns
or
has
this
torn
sleeve
brought
me
to
this
senseless
pitiful
wrath
or
was
this
the
last
act
of
my
human
masquerade
when
man
spirit
descends
to
the
mire
and
sweeps
the
dust
and
dirt
with
its
breath
or
has
the
of
madonna
which
i
witnessed
dragged
satan
too
into
the
same
abyss
but
this
was
think
of
it
this
was
what
i
answered
magnus
thrusting
out
my
chest
barely
covered
with
my
torn
shirt
stealthily
pulling
up
my
sleeve
so
that
it
might
not
slip
off
entirely
and
looking
sternly
and
angrily
directly
into
the
stupid
and
as
they
seemed
to
me
frightened
eyes
of
the
scoundrel
magnus
i
replied
i
am
satan
magnus
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
broke
out
into
all
the
laughter
that
a
drunken
repulsive
human
belly
can
contain
of
course
you
old
man
expected
that
but
i
did
not
i
swear
by
eternal
salvation
i
did
not
i
shouted
something
but
the
brazen
laughter
of
this
beast
drowned
my
voice
finally
taking
advantage
of
a
interval
between
his
thundering
peals
of
laughter
i
exclaimed
quickly
and
modestly
like
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
like
a
commentary
of
a
publisher
do
you
understand
i
am
satan
i
have
donned
the
human
form
i
have
donned
the
human
form
he
heard
me
with
his
eyes
bulging
and
with
fresh
thunderous
roars
of
laughter
the
outbursts
shaking
his
entire
frame
he
moved
toward
the
door
flung
it
open
and
shouted
here
come
here
here
is
satan
in
human
human
garb
and
he
disappeared
behind
the
door
oh
if
i
could
only
have
fallen
through
the
floor
disappeared
or
flown
away
like
a
real
devil
on
wings
in
that
endless
moment
during
which
he
was
gathering
the
for
an
extraordinary
spectacle
and
now
they
came
all
of
them
damn
them
maria
and
all
the
six
and
my
miserable
toppi
and
magnus
himself
and
completing
the
procession
his
eminence
cardinal
the
cursed
shaven
monkey
walked
with
great
dignity
and
even
bowed
to
me
after
which
he
sat
down
just
as
dignified
in
an
armchair
and
carefully
covered
his
knees
with
his
robes
all
were
wondering
not
knowing
yet
what
it
was
all
about
and
glanced
now
at
me
and
now
at
magnus
who
tried
hard
to
look
serious
what
the
trouble
signor
magnus
asked
the
cardinal
in
a
benevolent
tone
permit
me
to
report
the
following
your
eminence
henry
wondergood
has
just
informed
me
that
he
is
satan
yes
satan
and
that
he
has
merely
donned
the
human
form
and
thus
our
assumption
that
he
is
an
american
from
illinois
falls
wondergood
is
satan
and
apparently
has
but
recently
deigned
to
arrive
from
hell
what
shall
we
do
about
it
your
eminence
silence
might
have
saved
me
but
how
could
i
restrain
this
maddened
wondergood
whose
heart
was
aflame
with
insult
like
a
lackey
who
has
appropriated
his
celebrated
master
name
and
who
faintly
senses
something
of
his
grandeur
power
and
connections
wondergood
stepped
forward
and
said
with
an
ironic
bow
yes
i
am
satan
but
i
must
add
to
the
speech
of
signor
magnus
that
not
only
do
i
wear
the
human
form
but
also
that
i
have
been
robbed
are
those
scoundrels
who
have
robbed
me
known
to
you
your
eminence
and
are
you
perhaps
one
of
them
your
eminence
magnus
alone
continued
to
smile
the
rest
it
seemed
to
me
grew
serious
and
awaited
the
cardinal
reply
it
followed
the
shaven
monkey
it
developed
was
not
a
bad
actor
pretending
to
be
startled
the
cardinal
raised
his
right
hand
and
said
with
an
expression
of
extreme
goodness
contrasting
sharply
with
his
words
and
gesture
vade
petro
satanas
i
am
not
going
to
describe
to
you
how
they
laughed
you
can
imagine
it
even
maria
teeth
parted
slightly
almost
losing
consciousness
from
anger
and
impotence
i
turned
to
toppi
for
sympathy
and
aid
but
toppi
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
was
cringing
in
the
corner
silent
amid
general
laughter
and
ringing
far
above
it
came
the
heavy
voice
of
magnus
laden
with
infinite
ridicule
look
at
the
plucked
rooster
that
is
satan
and
again
there
came
an
outburst
of
laughter
his
eminence
continuously
shook
as
though
flapping
his
wings
and
choked
and
whined
the
monkey
gullet
could
hardly
pass
the
cascades
of
laughter
i
tore
off
that
accursed
sleeve
madly
and
waving
it
like
a
flag
i
ventured
into
a
sea
of
falsehood
with
full
sails
set
i
knew
that
somewhere
ahead
there
were
rocks
against
which
i
might
be
shattered
but
the
tempest
of
impotence
and
anger
bore
me
on
like
a
chip
of
wood
i
am
ashamed
to
repeat
my
speech
here
every
word
of
it
was
trembling
and
wailing
with
impotency
like
a
village
vicar
frightening
his
ignorant
parishioners
i
threatened
them
with
and
with
all
the
dantean
tortures
of
literary
fame
oh
i
did
know
something
that
i
might
really
have
frightened
them
with
but
how
could
i
express
the
which
is
inexpressible
in
their
language
and
so
i
prattled
on
of
eternal
fire
of
eternal
torture
of
unquenchable
thirst
of
the
gnashing
of
teeth
of
the
fruitlessness
of
tears
and
pleading
and
what
else
ah
even
of
red
hot
forks
i
prattled
maddened
more
and
more
by
the
indifference
and
shamelessness
of
these
shallow
faces
these
small
eyes
these
mediocre
souls
regarding
themselves
above
punishment
but
they
remained
unmoved
and
smug
as
if
in
a
fortress
beyond
the
walls
of
their
mediocrity
and
fatal
blindness
and
all
my
words
were
shattered
against
their
impenetrable
skulls
and
think
of
it
the
only
one
who
was
really
frightened
was
my
toppi
and
yet
he
alone
could
that
all
my
words
were
lies
it
was
so
unbearably
ridiculous
when
i
met
his
pleading
frightened
eyes
that
i
abruptly
ended
my
speech
suddenly
at
its
very
climax
silently
i
waved
my
torn
sleeve
which
served
me
as
a
standard
once
or
twice
and
hurled
it
into
the
corner
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
shaven
monkey
too
was
frightened
the
blue
of
his
cheeks
seemed
to
stand
out
sharply
upon
the
pale
square
face
and
the
little
coals
of
his
eyes
were
glowing
suspiciously
beneath
his
black
bushy
eyebrows
but
he
slowly
raised
his
hand
and
the
same
voice
broke
the
general
silence
vade
petro
satanas
or
did
the
cardinal
try
to
hide
behind
this
jest
his
actual
fright
i
do
not
know
i
know
nothing
if
i
could
not
destroy
them
like
sodom
and
gomorrah
is
it
worth
while
speaking
of
cold
shivers
and
goose
flesh
a
mere
glass
of
wine
can
conquer
them
and
magnus
like
the
skilled
healer
of
souls
that
he
was
said
calmly
will
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
your
eminence
with
pleasure
replied
the
cardinal
but
none
for
satan
added
magnus
jestingly
pouring
out
the
wine
but
he
could
speak
and
do
anything
he
pleased
now
wondergood
was
squeezed
dry
and
hung
like
a
rag
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
after
the
wine
had
been
drunk
magnus
lit
a
cigarette
he
smokes
cigarettes
cast
his
eye
over
the
audience
like
a
lecturer
before
a
lecture
motioned
pleasantly
to
toppi
now
grown
quite
pale
and
said
the
following
although
he
was
obviously
drunk
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
voice
was
firm
and
his
speech
flowed
with
measured
calm
i
must
say
wondergood
that
i
listened
to
you
very
attentively
and
your
passionate
tirade
created
upon
me
i
may
say
a
great
artistic
impression
at
certain
points
you
reminded
me
of
the
best
passages
of
brother
geronimo
savanarola
do
you
also
find
the
same
striking
resemblance
your
eminence
but
alas
you
are
slightly
behind
the
times
those
threats
of
hell
and
eternal
torture
with
which
you
might
have
driven
the
beautiful
and
merry
florence
to
panic
ring
extremely
unconvincing
in
the
atmosphere
of
contemporary
rome
the
sinners
have
long
since
departed
from
the
earth
wondergood
have
not
you
noticed
that
and
as
for
criminals
and
as
you
have
expressed
it
scoundrels
a
plain
commissary
of
police
is
much
more
alarming
to
them
than
beelzebub
himself
with
his
whole
staff
of
devils
i
must
also
confess
that
your
reference
to
the
court
of
history
and
posterity
was
rather
strange
when
contrasted
with
the
picture
you
painted
of
the
tortures
of
hell
and
your
reference
to
eternity
but
here
too
you
failed
to
rise
to
the
height
of
contemporary
thought
every
fool
nowadays
knows
that
history
records
with
equal
impartiality
both
the
names
of
saints
and
of
rogues
the
whole
point
wondergood
which
you
as
an
american
should
be
particularly
familiar
with
is
in
the
scope
with
which
history
treats
its
respective
subjects
and
heroes
the
lashings
history
administers
to
its
great
criminals
differ
but
little
from
her
laurels
when
viewed
at
a
distance
and
this
little
distinction
eventually
becomes
quite
invisible
i
assure
you
wondergood
in
fact
it
disappears
entirely
and
in
so
far
as
the
biped
strives
to
find
a
place
in
history
and
we
are
all
animated
by
this
desire
wondergood
it
need
not
be
particular
through
which
door
it
enters
i
beg
the
indulgence
of
his
eminence
but
no
prostitute
received
a
new
guest
with
greater
welcome
than
does
history
a
new
hero
i
fear
wondergood
that
your
references
to
hell
as
well
as
those
to
history
have
fallen
flat
ah
i
fear
your
hope
in
the
police
will
prove
equally
i
have
failed
to
tell
you
that
his
eminence
has
received
a
certain
share
of
those
billions
which
you
have
transferred
to
me
in
such
a
perfectly
legal
manner
while
his
connections
you
understand
poor
toppi
all
he
could
do
was
to
keep
on
blinking
the
broke
into
loud
laughter
but
the
cardinal
mumbled
angrily
casting
upon
me
the
burning
little
coals
of
his
eyes
he
is
indeed
a
brazen
fellow
he
said
he
is
satan
throw
him
out
signor
magnus
this
is
sacrilege
is
that
so
smiled
magnus
politely
i
did
not
know
that
satan
too
belonged
to
the
heavenly
chair
satan
is
a
fallen
angel
said
the
cardinal
in
an
instructive
tone
and
as
such
he
is
in
your
service
i
understand
magnus
bowed
his
head
politely
in
acceptance
of
this
truth
and
turned
smilingly
to
me
do
you
hear
wondergood
his
eminence
is
irritated
by
your
audacity
i
was
silent
magnus
winked
at
me
slyly
and
continued
with
an
air
of
artificial
importance
i
believe
your
eminence
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
misunderstanding
here
i
know
the
modesty
and
mind
of
wondergood
and
i
suppose
that
he
utilized
the
name
of
satan
merely
as
an
artistic
gesture
does
satan
ever
threaten
people
with
the
police
but
my
unfortunate
friend
did
and
in
general
has
anybody
ever
seen
a
satan
he
stretched
his
hand
out
to
me
in
an
effective
gesture
and
the
reply
to
this
was
another
outburst
of
laughter
the
cardinal
too
laughed
and
toppi
alone
shook
his
wise
head
as
if
to
say
idiots
i
think
magnus
must
have
noticed
that
or
else
he
fell
into
intoxication
or
was
it
because
that
spirit
of
murder
with
which
his
soul
was
aflame
could
not
remain
passive
and
was
tearing
at
the
leash
he
threateningly
shook
his
heavy
explosive
head
and
shouted
enough
of
this
laughter
it
is
silly
why
are
you
so
sure
of
yourselves
it
is
stupid
i
tell
you
i
believe
in
nothing
and
that
is
why
i
admit
press
my
hand
wondergood
they
are
all
fools
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
you
are
satan
only
you
have
fallen
into
a
bad
mess
friend
satan
because
it
will
not
save
you
i
will
soon
throw
you
out
anyhow
do
you
hear
devil
he
shook
his
finger
at
me
threateningly
and
then
lapsed
into
thought
dropping
his

and

cardinal
were
silent
with

magnus
again
shook
his
finger
at
me
significantly
and
said
if
you
are
satan
then
you
come
here
too
late
do
you
understand
what
did
you
come
here
for
anyway

play

say

tempt
to
laugh
at
us
human
beings
to
invent
some
sort
of

evil
game
to
make
us
dance
to
your
tune
well
you
too
late
you
should
have
come
earlier
for
the
earth
is
grown
now
and
no
longer
needs
your
talents
i
speak
not

myself

deceived
you
so
easily

took

your
money

thomas
ergo
i
speak
not

look
at
these
modest
little
friends
of
mine
where
in
your
hell
will
you
find
such
charming
fearless
devils
ready
for
any
task
and
yet
they
are
so
small
they
will
not
even
find
a
place
in
history
it
was
after
this
that
thomas
magnus
blew
me
up
in
the
holy
city
of
rome
in
the
palazzo
orsini
when
i
still
belonged
to
the
american
billionaire
henry
wondergood
do
you
remember
that
genial
american
with
his
cigar
and
patent
gold
teeth
alas
he
is
no
longer
with
us
he
died
suddenly
and
you
will
do
well
if
you
order
a
requiem
mass
for
him
his
illinois
soul
is
in
need
of
your
prayers
let
us
receive
the
last
breath
of
henry
wondergood
blown
up
by
the
culprit
thomas
magnus
and
buried
by
maria
