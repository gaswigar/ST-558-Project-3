the
yes
i
truly
think
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
nothing
so
dead
as
a
young
widow
deceased
husband
and
god
ought
to
give
his
wisest
special
charge
concerning
looking
after
her
and
the
devil
at
the
same
time
they
both
need
it
i
do
know
how
all
this
is
going
to
end
and
i
wish
my
mind
was
in
a
kind
of
tingle
however
i
do
the
best
i
can
and
not
hold
myself
at
all
responsible
for
myself
and
then
who
will
there
be
to
blame
there
are
a
great
many
kinds
of
in
this
world
from
radiant
joy
down
to
perfect
bliss
but
this
spring
i
have
got
an
attack
of
just
happiness
that
looks
as
if
it
might
become
chronic
i
am
so
happy
that
i
planted
my
garden
all
crooked
my
eyes
upon
the
clouds
with
the
birds
sailing
against
them
and
when
i
became
conscious
i
found
wicked
flaunting
poppies
sprouted
right
up
against
the
sweet
modest
while
the
whole
paper
of
was
sowed
over
everything
which
i
immediately
began
to
dig
right
up
again
blushing
furiously
to
myself
over
the
trowel
and
glad
that
i
had
caught
myself
before
they
grew
up
to
laugh
in
my
face
however
i
got
that
laugh
anyway
and
i
might
just
as
well
have
left
them
for
billy
ran
to
the
gate
and
called
doctor
john
to
come
in
and
make
molly
stop
digging
up
his
buttons
billy
claims
everything
in
this
garden
and
he
thought
they
would
grow
up
into
the
kind
of
buttons
you
pop
out
of
a
gun
so
you
digging
up
the
mrs
molly
the
doctor
asked
as
he
leaned
over
the
gate
i
went
right
on
digging
without
looking
up
at
him
i
could
look
up
because
i
was
blushing
still
worse
sometimes
i
hate
that
man
and
if
he
was
billy
father
i
would
neighbor
with
him
as
i
do
but
somebody
to
look
after
billy
i
believe
it
will
be
a
real
relief
to
write
down
how
i
feel
about
him
in
his
old
book
and
i
shall
do
it
whenever
i
ca
stand
him
any
longer
and
if
he
gave
the
horrid
red
leather
thing
to
me
to
make
me
miserable
he
ca
do
it
not
this
spring
i
wish
i
dared
burn
it
up
and
forget
about
it
but
i
do
this
record
on
the
first
page
is
enough
to
me
to
tears
and
i
wonder
why
it
does
i
weigh
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
down
in
black
and
white
and
it
is
a
tragedy
i
do
believe
that
man
at
the
grocery
store
is
so
very
reliable
in
his
weights
though
he
had
a
very
pleasant
smile
while
he
was
weighing
me
still
i
had
better
get
some
scales
of
my
own
smiles
are
so
deceptive
i
am
five
feet
three
inches
tall
or
short
whichever
way
one
looks
at
me
i
thought
i
was
taller
but
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
believe
my
own
yardstick
but
as
to
my
waist
measure
i
positively
refuse
to
write
that
down
even
if
i
have
promised
doctor
john
a
dozen
times
over
to
do
it
while
i
only
really
left
him
to
i
would
it
is
bad
enough
to
know
that
your
belt
has
to
be
reduced
to
inches
without
putting
down
how
much
it
measures
now
in
figures
to
insult
yourself
with
no
i
intend
to
have
this
for
my
happy
spring
yes
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
lots
better
for
my
happiness
if
i
had
kept
quiet
about
it
all
but
at
the
time
i
thought
i
had
to
advise
with
him
over
the
matter
now
i
sorry
i
did
that
is
one
thing
about
being
a
widow
you
are
accustomed
to
advising
with
a
man
whether
you
want
to
or
not
and
you
ca
get
over
the
habit
right
away
poor
carter
has
been
dead
much
over
a
year
and
i
must
be
missing
him
most
awfully
though
just
lately
i
ca
remember
not
to
forget
about
him
a
great
deal
of
the
time
now
if
he
had
been
here
still
that
letter
was
enough
to
upset
anybody
and
no
wonder
i
ran
right
across
my
garden
through
billy
and
over
into
doctor
john
office
to
tell
him
about
it
but
i
ought
not
to
have
been
agitated
enough
to
let
him
take
the
letter
right
out
of
my
hand
and
read
it
so
after
ten
years
al
bennett
is
coming
back
to
pop
his
at
you
mrs
molly
he
said
in
the
deep
drawling
voice
he
always
uses
when
he
makes
fun
of
billy
and
me
and
which
never
fails
to
make
us
both
mad
i
did
look
at
him
directly
but
i
felt
his
hand
shake
with
the
letter
in
it
not
ten
only
he
went
when
i
was
seventeen
i
answered
with
dignity
wishing
i
dared
be
snappy
at
him
though
i
never
am
and
after
eight
years
he
wants
to
come
back
and
find
you
squeezed
into
a
blue
muslin
rag
you
wore
at
parting
no
wonder
al
did
succeed
at
bank
clerking
but
had
to
make
his
hit
at
diplomacy
and
the
high
arts
some
hit
at
that
to
be
legationed
at
saint
james
he
such
a
big
gun
that
it
is
a
pity
he
had
to
return
to
his
native
heath
and
find
even
such
a
slight
disappointment
as
a
waist
measure
around
his
his
oh
it
not
it
that
much
i
fairly
gasped
and
i
help
the
tears
coming
into
my
eyes
i
have
never
said
much
about
it
but
nobody
knows
how
it
hurts
me
to
be
all
this
fat
just
writing
it
down
in
a
book
mortifies
me
dreadfully
it
been
coming
on
worse
and
worse
every
year
since
i
married
poor
carter
had
a
very
good
appetite
and
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
felt
that
i
had
to
eat
so
much
every
day
to
keep
him
company
i
was
always
so
considerate
of
him
then
he
did
want
me
to
dance
any
more
because
married
women
ought
or
ride
horseback
either
no
amusement
left
but
himself
and
weekly
and
and
i
just
could
help
the
tears
coming
and
dripping
as
i
thought
about
it
all
and
that
awful
waist
measure
in
inches
stop
crying
this
minute
molly
said
doctor
john
suddenly
in
the
deep
voice
he
uses
to
billy
and
me
when
we
are
really
sick
or
you
know
i
was
only
teasing
you
and
i
wo
stand
for
but
i
sobbed
some
more
i
like
him
when
his
eyes
come
out
from
under
his
bushy
brows
and
are
all
tender
and
full
of
sorry
for
us
i
ca
help
it
i
gulped
in
my
sleeve
i
did
used
to
like
alfred
bennett
my
heart
almost
broke
when
he
went
away
i
used
to
be
beautiful
and
slim
and
now
i
feel
as
if
my
own
fat
ghost
has
come
to
haunt
me
all
my
life
i
am
so
ashamed
if
a
woman
ca
cry
over
her
own
dead
beauty
what
can
she
cry
over
by
this
time
i
was
really
crying
then
what
happened
to
me
was
that
doctor
john
took
me
by
the
shoulders
and
gave
me
one
good
shake
and
then
made
me
look
him
right
in
the
eyes
through
the
tears
and
all
you
foolish
child
he
said
in
the
deepest
voice
i
almost
ever
heard
him
use
you
are
just
a
lovely
round
luscious
peach
but
if
you
will
be
happier
to
have
al
bennett
come
and
find
you
as
slim
as
a
i
can
show
you
how
to
do
it
will
you
do
just
as
i
tell
you
illustration
will
you
do
just
as
i
tell
you
yes
i
will
i
sniffed
in
a
comforted
voice
what
woman
would
be
comforted
by
being
called
a
luscious
peach
i
looked
out
between
my
fingers
to
see
what
more
he
was
going
to
say
but
he
had
turned
to
a
shelf
and
taken
down
two
books
now
he
said
in
his
most
businesslike
voice
as
cool
as
a
bucket
of
water
fresh
from
the
spring
it
is
no
trouble
at
all
to
take
off
your
surplus
avoirdupois
at
the
rate
of
two
and
a
half
pounds
a
week
if
you
follow
these
directions
as
i
take
it
you
are
about
pounds
over
your
normal
weight
it
will
take
over
two
months
to
reduce
you
and
we
will
allow
an
extra
month
for
further
beautifying
so
that
when
bennett
arrives
he
will
find
the
lady
of
his
adoration
in
proper
trim
to
be
adored
yes
just
be
still
until
i
copy
these
directions
in
this
little
red
leather
for
you
and
every
day
i
want
you
to
keep
an
exact
record
of
the
conditions
of
which
i
make
note
no
do
talk
while
i
make
out
these
diet
lists
i
wish
you
would
go
across
the
hall
and
see
if
you
do
think
we
ought
to
get
bill
a
thinner
set
of
it
seems
to
me
he
must
be
too
warm
in
the
ones
he
is
wearing
when
he
speaks
to
me
in
that
tone
of
voice
i
always
do
it
and
i
needed
billy
badly
at
that
very
moment
i
took
him
out
of
his
little
cot
by
doctor
john
big
bed
and
sat
down
with
him
in
my
arms
over
by
the
window
through
which
the
early
moon
came
streaming
billy
is
so
little
little
not
to
have
a
mother
to
rock
him
all
the
times
he
needs
it
that
i
take
every
opportunity
to
give
it
to
him
i
find
when
he
unconscious
and
ca
help
himself
she
died
before
she
ever
even
saw
him
and
always
tried
to
do
what
i
could
to
make
it
up
to
him
poor
carter
said
when
billy
cut
his
teeth
that
a
neighbor
baby
can
be
worse
than
twins
of
your
own
he
did
like
children
and
the
crying
disturbed
him
so
many
a
night
i
walked
billy
out
in
the
garden
until
daylight
while
carter
and
doctor
john
both
slept
always
his
little
warm
wilty
body
has
comforted
me
for
the
emptiness
of
not
having
a
baby
of
my
own
and
he
very
congenial
too
for
he
slim
and
flowery
pink
and
dimply
and
as
mannish
as
his
father
in
funny
little
flashes
git
a
stick
to
punch
it
molly
he
was
murmuring
in
his
sleep
then
i
heard
the
doctor
call
me
and
i
had
to
kiss
him
put
him
back
in
his
bed
and
go
across
the
hall
doctor
john
was
standing
by
the
table
with
this
horrid
small
book
in
his
hand
and
his
mouth
was
set
in
a
straight
line
and
his
eyes
were
deep
back
under
their
brows
i
hate
him
that
way
too
and
i
would
like
to
get
up
so
close
to
him
that
he
could
me
or
have
a
door
locked
between
us
it
strange
how
the
thought
of
taking
a
beating
from
a
man
can
make
a
woman
heart
jump
mine
jumped
so
it
was
hard
to
look
as
meek
as
i
felt
best
under
the
circumstances
but
i
looked
it
out
from
under
my
lashes
cautiously
there
you
are
molly
he
said
briskly
as
he
handed
me
this
book
get
weighed
and
measured
and
generally
in
the
morning
and
follow
all
the
directions
also
make
every
record
i
have
noted
so
that
i
can
have
the
proper
data
to
help
you
as
you
go
along
or
rather
down
and
if
you
will
be
faithful
about
it
to
me
or
rather
al
i
think
we
can
be
sure
of
buttoning
that
blue
muslin
dress
without
even
the
aid
of
the
his
voice
had
the
if
you
can
note
in
it
that
always
sets
me
off
had
we
better
get
the
kiddie
some
thinner
he
hastened
to
ask
as
i
was
just
about
to
explode
he
knows
the
signs
thank
you
doctor
moore
i
hate
the
very
ground
you
walk
on
and
attend
to
those
myself
i
answered
and
i
sailed
out
of
that
office
and
down
the
path
toward
my
own
house
beyond
his
hedge
but
i
carried
this
book
tight
in
my
hand
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
do
it
all
if
it
killed
me
i
would
show
him
i
could
be
to
whom
i
would
decide
later
on
but
i
had
read
far
into
this
book
when
i
committed
myself
to
myself
like
that
i
do
know
just
how
long
i
sat
on
the
front
steps
all
by
myself
bathed
in
a
perfect
flood
of
moonlight
and
loneliness
it
was
not
a
bit
of
comfort
to
hear
aunt
adeline
snoring
away
in
her
room
down
the
dark
hall
it
takes
the
greatest
congeniality
to
make
a
person
snoring
a
pleasure
to
anybody
and
aunt
adeline
and
i
are
not
that
way
when
poor
carter
died
the
next
day
she
said
now
mary
you
are
entirely
too
young
to
live
all
your
long
years
of
widowhood
alone
and
as
i
am
in
the
same
condition
i
will
rent
my
cottage
and
move
right
up
the
street
into
your
house
to
protect
and
console
you
and
she
did
the
moving
and
the
protecting
henderson
has
been
dead
years
he
only
lived
three
months
after
he
married
aunt
adeline
and
her
crepe
veil
is
over
a
yard
long
yet
men
are
the
dust
under
her
feet
but
she
likes
for
doctor
john
to
come
over
and
sit
on
the
porch
with
us
because
she
can
consult
with
him
about
what
henderson
really
died
of
and
talk
with
him
about
the
sad
state
of
poor
carter
liver
for
a
year
before
he
died
i
just
go
on
rocking
billy
and
singing
hymns
to
him
in
such
a
way
that
i
ca
hear
the
conversation
carter
liver
got
on
my
nerves
alive
and
dead
it
does
worse
but
it
hurts
when
the
doctor
has
to
take
the
little
out
of
my
arms
to
carry
him
home
though
i
like
it
when
he
says
under
his
breath
thank
you
molly
and
as
i
sat
and
thought
how
near
he
and
i
had
been
to
each
other
in
all
our
troubles
i
excused
myself
for
running
to
him
with
that
letter
and
i
acknowledged
to
myself
that
i
had
no
right
to
get
mad
when
he
teased
me
for
he
had
been
kind
and
interested
about
helping
me
get
thin
by
the
time
alfred
came
back
to
see
me
i
could
tell
which
i
was
blushing
all
to
myself
about
the
luscious
peach
he
had
called
me
or
the
lovely
lily
alfred
had
reminded
me
in
his
letter
that
i
had
been
when
he
left
me
why
do
people
realize
that
a
girl
heart
is
a
sensitive
that
may
be
shattered
by
a
breath
mine
shattered
when
alfred
went
away
to
find
something
he
could
do
to
make
a
living
and
aunt
adeline
gave
the
hard
green
stem
to
carter
when
she
married
me
to
him
poor
carter
no
i
was
twenty
and
this
town
was
full
of
women
who
were
aunts
and
cousins
and
to
me
and
nobody
did
anything
for
me
they
all
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
will
be
such
a
nice
safe
thing
for
you
molly
and
they
really
did
mean
anything
by
tying
up
a
gay
dancing
frolicking
prancing
colt
of
a
girl
with
a
terribly
ponderous
bridle
but
god
did
want
to
see
me
always
trotting
along
slow
and
tired
and
not
caring
what
happened
to
me
even
pounds
and
pounds
of
plumpness
so
he
found
use
for
carter
in
some
other
place
but
this
world
and
i
feel
that
he
is
going
to
see
me
through
whatever
happens
if
some
of
the
women
in
my
missionary
society
knew
how
friendly
i
feel
with
god
they
would
put
me
out
for
contempt
of
court
no
the
town
did
mean
anything
by
chastening
my
spirit
with
carter
and
they
did
consider
him
in
the
matter
at
all
poor
man
of
that
i
feel
sure
hillsboro
is
like
that
it
settled
itself
here
in
a
tennessee
valley
a
few
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
has
been
hatching
and
clucking
over
its
own
small
affairs
ever
since
all
the
houses
set
back
from
the
street
with
their
wings
spread
out
over
their
gardens
and
mothers
here
go
on
hovering
even
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
lots
of
times
young
boys
scramble
out
of
the
nests
and
go
off
to
college
and
decide
to
grow
up
where
their
crow
will
be
heard
by
the
world
alfred
was
one
of
them
and
too
occasionally
some
man
comes
along
from
the
big
world
and
marries
a
plump
little
broiler
and
takes
her
away
with
him
but
mostly
they
stay
and
go
to
hovering
life
on
a
corner
of
the
family
estate
that
what
i
did
i
was
a
poor
little
lost
chick
with
frivolous
tendencies
and
they
all
clucked
me
over
into
this
empty
carter
nest
which
they
considered
for
me
it
gave
them
all
a
sensation
when
they
found
out
from
the
will
just
how
well
it
was
feathered
and
it
gave
me
one
too
all
that
money
would
make
me
nervous
if
carter
had
made
doctor
john
its
guardian
though
i
sometimes
feel
that
the
responsibility
of
me
makes
him
treat
me
as
if
he
were
my
but
all
in
all
though
stiff
in
its
knees
with
aristocracy
hillsboro
is
lovely
and
loving
and
could
inquisitiveness
be
called
just
real
affection
with
a
kind
of
squint
in
its
eye
and
there
i
sat
on
my
front
steps
being
embraced
in
a
perfume
of
everybody
lilacs
and
peachblow
and
sweet
syringa
and
affectionate
interest
and
moonlight
with
a
letter
in
my
hand
from
the
man
whose
two
photographs
and
many
letters
i
had
kept
locked
up
in
the
garret
for
years
is
it
any
wonder
i
tingled
when
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
come
back
because
he
could
have
me
and
that
now
the
minute
he
landed
in
america
he
was
going
to
lay
his
heart
at
my
feet
i
added
his
honors
to
his
prostrate
heart
myself
and
my
own
beat
at
the
prospect
all
the
eight
years
faded
away
and
i
was
again
back
in
the
old
garden
down
at
aunt
adeline
cottage
saying
folded
up
in
his
arms
the
way
my
memory
put
the
scene
to
me
but
the
word
folded
made
me
remember
that
blue
muslin
dress
again
i
had
promised
to
keep
it
and
wear
it
for
him
when
he
came
back
and
i
could
forget
that
the
blue
belt
was
just
inches
and
mine
is
no
i
write
it
i
had
got
that
dress
out
of
the
old
trunk
not
ten
minutes
after
i
had
read
the
letter
and
measured
it
no
nobody
would
blame
me
for
running
right
across
the
garden
to
doctor
john
with
such
a
real
trouble
as
that
all
of
a
sudden
i
hugged
the
letter
and
the
little
book
up
close
to
my
breast
and
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
then
before
i
went
into
the
house
i
assembled
my
garden
and
had
family
prayers
with
my
flowers
i
do
that
because
they
are
all
the
family
got
and
god
knows
that
all
his
budding
things
need
encouragement
whether
it
is
a
widow
or
a
he
give
it
to
us
and
i
praying
again
as
i
sit
here
and
watch
for
the
doctor
light
to
go
out
i
hate
to
go
to
sleep
and
leave
it
burning
for
he
sits
up
so
late
and
he
is
so
gaunt
and
thin
and
most
times
what
the
last
prayer
is
about
almost
always
sleep
for
him
and
no
night
call
leaf
second
a
loaded
the
very
worst
page
in
this
red
red
devil
i
glad
i
written
it
at
last
of
a
book
is
the
fifth
it
says
breakfast
one
slice
of
dry
toast
one
egg
fruit
and
a
tablespoonful
of
baked
cereal
small
cup
of
coffee
no
sugar
no
cream
and
me
with
two
jersey
cows
full
of
the
richest
cream
in
hillsboro
harpeth
valley
out
in
my
pasture
dinner
one
small
lean
chop
slice
of
toast
spinach
green
beans
and
lettuce
salad
no
dessert
or
sweet
the
in
my
yard
is
full
of
fat
little
fryers
and
i
wish
i
were
a
sheep
if
i
have
to
eat
lettuce
and
spinach
for
grass
at
least
i
have
more
than
one
chop
inside
me
then
supper
slice
of
toast
and
an
apple
why
the
apple
why
supper
at
all
oh
i
hungry
hungry
until
i
cry
in
my
sleep
when
i
dream
about
a
muffin
i
thought
at
first
that
getting
out
of
bed
before
my
eyes
are
fairly
open
and
turning
myself
into
a
circus
actor
by
doing
every
kind
of
overhand
foot
arm
and
leg
contortion
that
the
mind
of
cruel
man
could
invent
to
torture
a
human
being
with
would
kill
me
before
i
had
been
at
it
a
week
but
when
i
read
on
page
sixteen
that
as
soon
as
all
that
horror
was
over
i
must
jump
right
into
the
tub
of
cold
water
i
kicked
metaphorically
speaking
and
i
been
kicking
ever
since
literally
to
keep
from
freezing
illustration
she
shrouds
me
for
the
agony
but
as
cruel
a
death
as
freezing
is
it
does
compare
to
the
tortures
of
being
melted
judy
administers
it
to
me
and
her
faithful
heart
is
so
wrung
with
compassion
that
she
perspires
almost
as
much
as
i
do
she
wrings
a
linen
sheet
out
in
a
caldron
of
boiling
water
and
shrouds
me
in
it
for
the
agony
and
then
more
and
more
blanket
windings
envelop
me
until
i
am
like
the
mummy
of
some
egyptian
giantess
i
have
ice
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
my
forehead
and
murder
for
the
whole
world
in
my
heart
once
i
got
so
discouraged
at
the
idea
of
having
all
this
hades
in
this
life
that
i
mingled
tears
with
the
beads
of
perspiration
that
rolled
down
my
cheeks
and
she
snatched
me
out
of
those
steaming
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
soused
me
in
a
tub
of
cold
water
fed
me
a
chicken
wing
and
a
hot
biscuit
and
the
information
that
i
was
enough
for
to
eat
up
alive
without
all
this
foolishness
all
in
a
very
few
seconds
now
i
have
to
beg
her
to
help
me
and
i
heard
her
tell
her
nephew
who
does
the
gardening
that
she
felt
like
an
undertaker
with
such
at
any
rate
if
it
all
kills
me
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
anybody
has
to
lie
in
saying
that
i
was
beautiful
in
death
but
now
that
more
than
a
month
has
passed
i
really
do
mind
it
so
much
i
feel
so
good
and
strong
and
prancy
all
the
time
that
i
keep
from
bubbling
i
have
to
smile
at
myself
then
another
thing
that
helps
is
billy
and
his
ball
i
never
could
really
play
with
him
before
but
now
i
ca
help
it
but
an
awful
thing
happened
about
that
yesterday
we
were
in
the
garden
playing
over
by
the
lilac
bushes
and
billy
always
beats
me
because
when
he
runs
to
base
he
throws
himself
down
and
slides
along
on
the
grass
on
his
little
stomach
as
he
sees
the
real
players
do
over
at
the
ball
grounds
then
all
of
a
sudden
before
i
knew
it
i
just
did
the
same
thing
and
we
slid
to
the
flower
pot
we
use
as
a
base
together
each
on
his
own
stomach
and
what
did
billy
do
but
begin
right
there
on
the
grass
the
kind
of
a
tussle
we
always
have
in
the
big
on
the
porch
over
and
over
we
rolled
billy
chuckling
and
squealing
while
i
laughed
myself
all
out
of
breath
i
glad
i
always
would
wear
delicious
petticoats
for
there
looking
right
over
my
front
fence
i
discovered
judge
benton
wade
i
wish
i
could
write
down
how
i
felt
for
i
never
had
that
sensation
before
and
i
do
believe
i
ever
have
it
again
i
have
always
thought
that
judge
wade
was
really
the
most
wonderful
man
in
hillsboro
not
because
he
is
a
judge
so
young
in
life
that
there
is
only
a
white
sprinkle
in
his
lovely
black
hair
that
grows
back
off
his
head
like
napoleon
and
charles
wesley
but
because
of
his
smile
which
you
wait
for
so
long
that
you
glow
all
over
when
you
get
it
i
have
seen
him
do
it
once
or
twice
at
his
mother
when
he
seats
her
in
their
pew
at
church
and
once
at
little
mamie
johnson
when
she
gave
him
a
flower
through
their
fence
as
he
passed
by
one
day
last
week
but
i
never
thought
i
should
have
one
all
to
myself
but
there
it
was
a
most
beautiful
one
long
and
slow
and
distinctly
mine
at
least
i
think
much
of
it
was
for
billie
i
sat
up
and
blushed
as
red
all
over
as
i
do
when
i
first
hit
that
tub
of
cold
water
illustration
i
sat
up
and
blushed
red
all
over
i
hope
you
forgive
an
intruder
carter
but
how
could
a
mortal
resist
a
peep
into
the
garden
of
the
gods
if
he
spied
the
queen
and
her
faun
at
play
he
said
in
a
voice
as
wonderful
as
the
smile
by
that
time
i
had
reefed
in
my
ruffles
around
my
feet
and
pushed
in
all
my
hairpins
billy
stood
as
near
in
front
of
me
as
he
could
get
and
said
in
the
rudest
possible
tone
of
voice
get
away
from
my
molly
man
i
never
was
so
mortified
in
all
my
life
and
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
came
over
to
the
fence
to
get
between
him
and
billy
it
a
lovely
day
is
it
judge
wade
i
asked
with
the
greatest
interest
which
i
did
really
feel
in
the
weather
but
what
could
i
think
of
to
say
a
woman
is
apt
to
keep
the
image
of
a
good
many
of
the
grand
men
she
sees
passing
around
her
in
queer
niches
in
her
brain
and
when
one
steps
out
and
speaks
to
her
for
the
first
time
it
is
confusing
of
course
i
have
known
the
judge
and
his
mother
all
my
life
for
she
is
one
of
aunt
adeline
best
friends
but
i
had
a
feeling
from
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
that
very
minute
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
me
it
was
lovely
and
i
blushed
some
more
as
i
put
my
hand
up
to
my
cheek
so
i
would
have
to
look
right
at
him
about
the
loveliest
day
that
ever
happened
in
hillsboro
he
said
and
there
was
still
more
of
the
delicious
smile
though
i
had
noticed
it
so
especially
until
but
i
never
knew
what
he
had
intended
to
say
for
billy
suddenly
swelled
up
like
a
little
and
cut
out
with
his
switch
at
the
judge
git
man
git
and
let
my
molly
alone
he
said
in
a
perfect
thundertone
of
voice
but
i
almost
laughed
for
it
had
such
a
sound
in
it
like
doctor
john
at
his
most
positive
times
with
billy
and
me
no
no
billy
the
judge
is
just
looking
over
the
fence
at
our
flowers
do
you
want
to
give
him
a
rose
i
hurried
to
say
as
the
smile
died
out
of
judge
wade
face
and
he
looked
at
billy
intently
how
like
john
moore
the
youngster
is
he
said
and
his
voice
was
so
cold
to
billy
that
it
hurt
me
and
i
was
afraid
billy
would
notice
it
coldness
in
people
voices
always
makes
me
feel
just
like
tastes
but
billy
answer
was
still
more
rude
you
better
go
man
before
i
bring
my
father
to
sic
our
dog
on
you
he
exploded
and
before
i
could
stop
him
his
thin
little
legs
went
trundling
down
the
garden
path
toward
home
then
the
judge
and
i
both
laughed
we
could
help
it
when
two
people
laugh
straight
into
each
other
eyes
something
feels
dangerous
and
you
get
closer
together
the
judge
leaned
farther
over
the
fence
and
i
went
a
little
nearer
before
i
knew
it
you
do
need
to
keep
a
personal
dog
do
you
mrs
carter
he
asked
with
a
twinkle
that
might
have
been
a
spark
in
his
eyes
and
just
at
that
moment
another
awful
thing
happened
aunt
adeline
came
out
on
the
front
porch
and
said
in
the
most
frozen
tone
of
voice
mary
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
in
the
house
and
then
walked
back
through
the
front
door
without
even
looking
in
judge
wade
direction
though
he
had
waved
his
hat
with
one
of
his
mother
own
smiles
when
he
had
seen
her
before
i
did
one
of
my
most
impossible
habits
is
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
i
laugh
i
did
it
then
and
it
saved
the
day
for
we
both
laughed
into
each
others
eyes
a
second
time
and
before
we
realized
it
we
were
within
whispering
distance
no
i
do
do
need
any
dog
i
said
softly
hardly
glancing
out
from
under
my
lashes
because
i
was
afraid
to
risk
looking
straight
at
him
again
so
soon
i
could
fairly
feel
aunt
adeline
eyes
boring
into
my
back
it
would
take
the
monster
of
may
i
bring
my
mother
to
call
on
you
and
the
mrs
henderson
he
asked
and
poured
the
wonder
smile
all
over
me
again
i
almost
caught
my
breath
i
do
wish
you
would
aunt
adeline
is
so
fond
of
mrs
wade
i
said
in
a
positive
flutter
that
i
hope
he
did
see
but
i
am
afraid
he
did
for
he
hesitated
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
calm
me
then
bowed
mercifully
and
went
on
down
the
street
he
did
put
on
the
hat
he
had
held
in
his
hand
all
the
while
he
stood
by
the
fence
until
he
had
looked
back
and
bowed
again
then
i
felt
still
more
fluttered
as
i
went
into
the
house
but
i
received
the
third
cold
plunge
of
the
day
when
i
reached
the
front
hall
mary
said
aunt
adeline
in
a
voice
that
sounded
as
if
it
had
been
buried
and
never
resurrected
if
you
are
going
to
continue
in
such
an
unseemly
course
of
conduct
i
hope
you
will
remove
your
mourning
which
is
an
empty
mockery
and
an
insult
to
my
own
widowhood
yes
aunt
adeline
i
go
take
it
off
this
very
minute
i
heard
myself
answer
her
airily
to
my
own
astonishment
i
might
have
known
that
if
i
ever
got
one
of
those
smiles
it
would
go
to
my
head
without
another
word
i
sailed
into
my
room
and
closed
the
door
softly
i
wonder
if
god
could
have
realized
what
a
tender
thing
he
was
leaving
exposed
to
life
in
the
garden
of
the
world
after
he
had
finished
making
a
woman
traditionally
we
are
created
out
of
and
and
the
harmony
of
the
winds
but
we
need
a
netting
to
fend
us
slowly
i
unbuttoned
that
black
dress
that
symbolized
the
ending
of
six
years
of
the
blackness
of
a
married
life
from
which
i
had
been
powerless
to
fend
myself
and
the
rosy
dimpling
thing
in
snowy
lingerie
with
tags
of
blue
ribbon
that
stood
in
front
of
my
mirror
was
as
as
any
other
similar
bundle
of
linen
and
lace
in
hillsboro
tennessee
fortunately
an
old
white
lawn
dress
could
be
pulled
from
the
top
shelf
of
the
closet
in
a
hurry
and
the
molly
that
came
out
of
that
room
was
ready
for
life
and
a
lot
of
it
quick
and
fast
and
again
fortunately
aunt
adeline
had
retired
with
a
violent
headache
and
black
judy
was
carrying
her
in
a
hot
with
a
broad
grin
on
her
face
judy
sees
the
world
from
the
kitchen
window
and
understands
everything
she
had
laid
a
large
thick
letter
on
the
hall
table
where
i
could
fail
to
see
it
i
took
possession
of
it
and
carried
it
to
a
bench
in
the
garden
that
backs
up
against
the
purple
sprayed
lilacs
and
is
flanked
by
two
rows
of
tall
purple
and
white
iris
that
stand
in
line
ready
for
a
virginia
reel
with
a
delicate
row
of
the
poet
narcissus
across
the
broad
path
i
love
my
flowers
i
love
them
swaying
on
their
stems
in
the
wind
and
i
like
to
snatch
them
and
crush
the
life
out
of
them
against
my
breast
and
face
i
have
been
to
bed
every
night
this
spring
with
a
bunch
of
cool
violets
against
my
cheek
and
i
feel
that
i
am
going
to
flirt
with
my
tall
row
of
hollyhocks
as
soon
as
they
are
old
enough
to
hold
up
their
heads
and
take
notice
they
always
remind
me
of
very
stately
gentlemen
and
i
have
wondered
if
the
fluffy
little
butter
and
eggs
were
shaking
their
ruffles
at
them
a
real
ought
to
be
like
a
cream
puff
with
a
drop
of
dynamite
in
it
alfred
was
that
kind
i
felt
warm
and
happy
down
to
my
toes
as
i
read
it
and
i
turned
around
so
old
lilac
bush
could
peep
over
my
shoulder
at
what
he
said
he
wrote
from
rome
this
time
where
he
had
been
sent
on
some
sort
of
diplomatic
mission
to
the
vatican
and
his
letter
about
the
ancient
city
on
her
seven
hills
was
a
in
itself
i
was
so
interested
that
i
read
on
and
on
and
forgot
it
was
almost
time
of
course
anybody
that
is
anybody
would
be
interested
in
father
tiber
and
the
old
colosseum
but
what
made
me
forget
the
one
slice
of
dry
toast
and
the
apple
was
the
way
he
seemed
to
be
connecting
me
up
with
all
those
wonderful
old
antiquities
that
had
never
even
seen
me
because
of
me
he
had
felt
and
written
that
poem
descriptive
of
old
tiber
and
the
moonlight
had
lit
up
the
colosseum
just
because
i
was
over
here
lighting
up
hillsboro
tennessee
with
carter
dead
of
course
that
is
not
the
way
he
put
it
all
but
there
is
no
place
to
really
copy
what
he
did
say
down
into
this
imp
book
and
anyway
that
is
the
sentiment
he
expressed
boiled
down
and
sugared
off
that
just
what
i
mean
love
boiled
down
and
sugared
off
is
mighty
apt
to
get
an
explosive
flavor
and
one
had
better
be
careful
with
that
kind
if
one
is
timid
which
i
not
as
i
said
also
i
am
ready
for
a
little
taste
of
life
so
i
read
on
without
fear
and
to
be
fair
alfred
had
well
boiled
his
own
last
paragraph
it
snapped
and
i
jumped
and
gasped
both
i
almost
thought
i
did
quite
like
it
and
was
going
to
read
it
over
again
to
see
when
there
came
a
procession
from
over
to
doctor
john
and
i
laid
the
bombshell
down
on
the
bench
first
came
the
red
setter
that
is
always
first
with
doctor
john
and
then
he
came
himself
leading
billy
by
the
hand
it
was
billy
but
the
most
subdued
billy
i
ever
saw
and
i
held
out
my
arms
and
started
for
him
wait
a
minute
please
molly
said
the
doctor
in
the
voice
he
always
uses
when
he
punishing
billy
and
me
bill
came
to
apologize
to
you
for
being
rude
to
your
your
guest
he
told
me
all
about
it
and
i
think
he
sorry
tell
carter
you
are
sorry
son
when
that
man
speaks
to
me
as
if
i
were
just
any
old
body
else
i
hate
him
so
it
is
a
wonder
i
do
show
it
more
than
i
do
but
there
was
nothing
to
say
and
i
looked
at
billy
and
billy
looked
at
me
then
suddenly
he
stretched
out
his
little
arms
to
me
and
the
dimples
winked
at
me
from
all
over
his
darling
face
molly
molly
he
said
with
a
perfect
rapture
of
chuckles
in
his
voice
now
you
look
just
as
pretty
as
you
do
when
you
go
to
bed
all
whity
all
over
you
can
kiss
my
a
hundred
times
while
i
you
for
that
nice
dress
and
before
any
stern
person
could
have
stopped
us
i
was
on
my
knees
on
the
grass
kissing
my
fill
from
the
on
the
back
of
his
neck
while
he
hugged
all
the
starch
out
of
the
and
doctor
john
sat
down
on
the
bench
quick
and
laughed
out
loud
one
of
the
very
few
times
i
ever
heard
him
do
it
he
was
looking
down
at
us
but
i
did
laugh
up
into
eyes
i
was
afraid
i
felt
it
was
safer
to
go
on
kissing
the
for
the
present
anyway
bill
he
said
with
his
voice
dancing
that
the
most
effective
apology
i
ever
heard
you
were
sorry
to
some
point
then
suddenly
billy
stiffened
right
in
my
arms
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
said
in
the
doctor
own
brisk
tones
even
with
his
cupid
mouth
set
in
the
same
straight
line
i
say
i
sorry
molly
but
damn
that
man
and
i
git
him
yet
what
could
we
say
what
could
we
do
we
did
try
i
busied
myself
in
tying
the
string
on
billy
blouse
that
had
come
untied
in
the
and
the
doctor
suddenly
discovered
the
letter
on
the
bench
i
saw
him
see
it
without
looking
in
his
direction
at
all
and
how
many
pounds
are
we
nearer
the
state
of
existence
mrs
molly
he
asked
me
before
i
had
finished
tying
the
blouse
in
the
nicest
voice
in
the
world
fairly
crackling
with
friendship
and
good
humor
and
hateful
things
like
that
why
i
should
have
wanted
him
to
huff
over
that
letter
is
more
than
i
can
say
but
i
did
and
he
did
over
twenty
and
most
of
the
time
i
am
so
hungry
i
could
eat
aunt
adeline
i
dream
about
billy
fried
with
cream
gravy
i
answered
as
i
kissed
again
the
back
of
the
head
that
was
beginning
to
nod
down
against
my
breast
long
shadows
lay
across
the
garden
and
the
old
was
signaling
out
of
the
dusk
to
a
dorothy
perkins
down
the
walk
in
a
scandalous
way
at
best
spring
is
just
the
old
chaperon
and
ought
to
be
watched
i
still
sat
on
the
grass
and
i
began
to
cuddle
billy
bare
knees
in
the
skirt
of
my
dress
so
the
chigres
could
get
at
them
but
molly
is
it
worth
it
all
asked
the
doctor
as
he
bent
over
toward
us
and
looked
down
with
something
wonderful
and
kind
in
his
eyes
that
seemed
to
rest
on
us
like
a
benediction
you
have
been
just
as
plucky
as
a
girl
can
be
and
in
only
a
little
over
two
months
you
have
grown
as
lightfooted
and
hearty
as
a
boy
think
nothing
could
be
lovelier
than
you
are
right
now
but
you
can
get
off
those
other
few
pounds
if
you
want
to
you
know
do
you
that
i
have
known
how
hard
some
of
it
was
and
i
have
been
able
to
eat
as
much
as
i
usually
do
thinking
how
hungry
you
are
but
is
it
all
worth
it
i
think
it
is
alfred
bennett
is
a
very
great
man
and
it
is
right
that
he
should
have
a
very
lovely
wife
to
go
out
into
the
world
with
him
and
as
lovely
as
you
are
i
think
it
is
wonderful
of
you
to
make
all
this
sacrifice
to
be
still
lovelier
for
him
i
am
glad
i
can
help
you
and
it
has
taught
me
something
to
see
how
how
faithful
a
woman
can
be
across
years
and
then
in
this
smaller
thing
now
give
me
bill
and
you
get
your
apple
and
toast
do
forget
to
take
your
letter
in
out
of
the
dew
i
sat
perfectly
still
and
held
billy
tighter
in
my
arms
as
i
looked
up
at
his
father
and
then
after
i
had
thought
as
long
as
i
could
stand
it
i
spoke
right
out
at
him
as
mad
as
hops
and
i
do
to
this
minute
know
why
nobody
in
the
world
ever
doubted
that
a
woman
could
be
faithful
if
she
had
anything
to
be
faithful
to
i
said
as
i
let
him
take
billy
out
of
my
arms
at
last
faithfulness
is
what
a
woman
flowers
only
it
takes
a
to
pick
his
posy
with
which
i
marched
into
the
house
and
left
him
standing
with
billy
in
his
arms
i
hope
dumfounded
i
look
back
to
see
i
always
leave
that
man
presence
so
mad
i
can
never
look
back
at
him
and
would
it
make
any
woman
rage
to
have
a
man
pick
out
another
man
for
her
to
be
faithful
to
when
she
had
made
any
decision
about
it
her
own
self
i
wonder
just
how
old
judge
wade
is
i
believe
i
will
make
up
with
aunt
adeline
enough
before
i
go
to
bed
to
find
out
why
he
has
never
married
leaf
third
monument
or
trousseau
men
are
very
strange
people
they
are
like
those
horrible
sums
in
algebra
that
you
think
about
and
worry
about
and
cry
about
and
try
to
get
help
from
other
women
about
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
x
works
itself
out
into
perfectly
good
sense
not
that
i
thought
much
about
carter
poor
man
when
he
was
right
around
i
felt
it
best
to
forget
him
as
much
as
i
could
but
it
seems
hard
for
other
women
to
let
you
forget
either
your
husband
or
theirs
i
know
now
that
i
really
never
got
any
older
than
the
poor
foolish
child
that
aunt
adeline
married
off
safe
all
the
time
i
was
the
refuge
sort
of
wife
i
would
sit
and
listen
while
the
other
wives
talked
over
the
men
in
utter
bewilderment
and
most
times
terror
then
i
would
force
myself
to
a
little
more
forgetting
and
poor
carter
must
have
suffered
the
consequences
but
all
that
was
a
mild
sort
of
exasperation
to
what
a
widow
has
to
go
through
with
in
the
matter
of
of
well
i
think
hazing
is
about
the
best
name
to
give
it
molly
carter
said
johnson
just
day
before
yesterday
after
the
episode
that
aunt
adeline
had
gone
to
all
the
friends
up
and
down
the
street
to
be
consoled
about
if
you
have
got
sense
enough
to
appreciate
your
present
blissful
condition
somebody
ought
to
operate
on
your
mind
i
was
tempted
to
say
why
not
my
heart
i
was
glad
she
did
know
how
good
that
heart
did
feel
under
my
tucker
when
the
boy
brought
that
basket
of
fish
from
judge
wade
fishing
trip
saturday
i
have
firmly
determined
not
to
blush
any
more
at
the
thought
of
that
gorgeous
man
at
least
outwardly
do
you
think
it
is
very
very
lonely
to
be
a
widow
mrs
johnson
i
asked
timidly
to
see
what
she
would
say
about
johnson
who
is
really
lovely
i
think
he
gives
me
the
gentlest
understanding
smile
when
he
meets
me
on
the
street
of
late
weeks
lonely
molly
you
talk
about
the
married
state
exactly
like
an
old
maid
do
do
it
it
foolish
and
you
will
get
the
lone
notion
really
fastened
in
your
mind
and
let
some
fool
man
find
out
that
is
how
you
feel
then
it
will
be
all
over
with
you
i
have
only
one
regret
and
it
is
that
if
i
ever
should
be
a
widow
johnson
be
here
to
see
how
quickly
i
turned
into
an
old
maid
by
the
grace
of
god
johnson
sews
by
assassinating
the
cloth
with
the
needle
and
as
she
talked
she
was
mending
the
sleeve
of
one
of
johnson
shirts
i
think
an
old
maid
is
just
a
woman
who
has
never
been
in
love
with
a
man
who
loves
her
lots
of
them
have
been
married
for
years
i
said
just
as
innocently
as
the
soft
face
of
a
pan
of
cream
and
went
on
darning
one
of
billy
socks
well
be
that
as
it
may
they
are
the
blessed
members
of
the
women
tribe
she
answered
looking
at
me
sharply
now
i
have
often
told
johnson
but
here
we
were
interrupted
in
what
might
have
been
the
rehearsal
of
a
glorious
scrap
by
the
appearance
of
aunt
bettie
pollard
and
with
her
came
a
long
tall
lovely
vision
of
a
woman
in
the
most
wonderful
close
clingy
dress
and
hat
that
you
wanted
to
eat
on
sight
i
hated
her
instantly
with
the
most
intense
adoration
that
made
me
want
to
lie
down
at
her
feet
and
also
made
me
feel
like
i
had
gained
all
the
more
than
twenty
pounds
that
i
have
slaved
off
me
and
doubled
them
on
again
i
would
have
liked
to
lead
her
that
minute
into
doctor
office
and
just
to
have
looked
at
him
and
said
one
word
aunt
betty
introduced
her
as
miss
chester
from
washington
oh
my
dear
carter
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
you
she
said
as
she
towered
over
me
in
a
willowy
way
and
her
voice
was
lovely
and
cool
almost
to
slimness
i
am
the
bearer
of
so
many
gracious
messages
that
i
am
anxious
to
deliver
them
safely
to
you
not
six
weeks
ago
i
left
alfred
bennett
in
paris
and
really
really
his
greetings
to
you
almost
amounted
to
steamer
luggage
he
came
down
to
cherbourg
to
see
me
off
and
almost
the
last
thing
he
said
to
me
was
do
fail
to
see
carter
as
soon
as
you
get
to
hillsboro
and
the
more
you
see
of
her
the
more
you
enjoy
your
visit
to
mrs
pollard
is
he
the
most
delightful
of
men
she
asked
me
the
question
but
she
had
the
most
wonderful
way
of
seeming
to
be
talking
to
everybody
at
one
time
so
johnson
got
in
the
first
answer
delightful
nothing
but
al
bennett
is
a
man
of
sense
not
to
marry
any
of
the
string
of
women
i
suppose
he
got
following
him
she
said
miss
chester
looked
at
her
in
a
mild
kind
of
wonder
but
she
went
on
murdering
johnson
with
the
needle
without
noticing
the
glance
at
all
well
well
honey
i
do
know
about
that
said
aunt
bettie
as
she
fanned
and
rocked
her
great
big
darling
fat
self
in
the
strong
rocker
i
always
kept
in
the
breezy
angle
of
the
porch
for
her
al
is
not
old
enough
to
have
proved
himself
entirely
and
from
what
i
hear
she
paused
with
the
big
hearty
smile
that
she
always
wears
when
she
begins
to
tease
or
and
she
does
them
both
most
of
her
time
but
at
whom
do
you
suppose
she
looked
not
me
miss
chester
that
was
cold
tub
number
two
for
that
day
and
i
did
react
as
quickly
as
i
might
but
when
i
did
i
was
in
the
proper
glow
all
over
when
i
revived
and
saw
the
lovely
pale
blush
on
her
face
i
felt
like
a
beside
a
i
was
glad
aunt
adeline
came
out
on
the
porch
just
then
so
i
could
go
in
and
tell
judy
to
bring
out
the
iced
tea
and
cakes
when
i
came
from
the
kitchen
i
stepped
into
my
room
and
took
out
one
of
alfred
letters
from
the
desk
drawer
and
opened
it
at
random
as
you
do
the
bible
when
you
want
to
decide
things
and
put
my
finger
down
on
a
line
with
my
eyes
shut
this
was
what
it
was
and
all
these
years
i
have
walked
the
world
blindfolded
to
its
loveliness
with
the
blackness
that
came
to
me
when
i
found
that
you
i
did
read
any
more
but
shoved
it
back
in
a
hurry
and
went
on
out
on
the
porch
comforted
in
a
way
but
feeling
some
more
in
sympathy
with
mrs
johnson
than
i
had
before
aunt
bettie
and
her
guest
from
washington
had
interrupted
our
algebraic
demonstration
on
the
man
subject
you
ca
always
be
sure
of
the
right
answer
to
x
in
any
proposition
of
life
that
is
a
woman
ca
and
furthermore
i
did
like
that
next
hour
much
just
as
a
sample
of
life
for
instance
aunt
bettie
had
got
her
humor
well
started
and
right
there
before
my
face
she
made
a
present
of
every
nice
man
in
hillsboro
to
that
lovely
distinguished
strange
girl
who
could
have
slipped
through
a
bucket
hoop
if
she
had
tried
hard
i
had
to
sit
there
listen
to
the
presentations
watch
her
drink
two
tall
delicious
glasses
of
tea
full
of
sugar
and
consume
without
fear
three
of
puffy
cakes
while
i
crumbled
mine
in
secret
over
the
banisters
and
set
half
the
glass
of
tea
out
of
sight
behind
the
wistaria
vine
it
was
bad
enough
to
hear
aunt
bettie
just
offer
her
tom
who
if
he
is
her
own
son
is
my
favorite
cousin
but
i
believe
the
worst
minute
i
almost
ever
faced
was
when
she
began
on
the
judge
for
i
could
see
from
aunt
adeline
shoulder
beyond
miss
chester
how
she
was
enjoying
that
and
she
added
another
distinguished
ancestor
to
his
pedigree
every
time
aunt
bettie
paused
for
breath
i
could
say
a
word
about
the
fish
and
aunt
adeline
would
i
almost
loved
johnson
when
she
bit
off
a
thread
viciously
and
said
humph
as
she
rose
to
start
the
home
that
night
i
did
so
many
exercises
that
at
last
i
sank
exhausted
in
a
chair
in
front
of
my
mirror
and
put
my
head
down
on
my
arms
and
cried
the
real
tears
you
cry
when
nobody
is
looking
i
felt
terribly
old
and
ugly
and
dowdy
and
widowed
it
could
have
been
jealousy
for
i
just
love
that
girl
i
want
most
awfully
to
hug
her
very
slimness
and
it
was
more
what
she
might
think
of
poor
dumpy
me
than
what
any
man
in
hillsboro
tennessee
or
paris
france
could
possibly
feel
on
the
subject
that
hurt
so
hard
but
then
looking
back
on
it
i
am
afraid
that
jealousy
sheds
feathers
every
night
so
you
wo
know
him
in
the
morning
for
something
made
me
sit
up
suddenly
with
a
spark
in
my
eyes
and
reach
out
to
the
desk
for
my
pencil
and
it
took
me
more
than
an
hour
to
figure
it
all
up
but
i
went
to
bed
a
happier
though
in
prospects
a
poorer
woman
it
is
strange
how
spending
a
man
money
makes
you
feel
more
congenial
with
him
and
as
i
sat
in
the
cars
on
my
way
to
the
city
early
the
next
morning
i
felt
nearer
to
carter
than
i
almost
ever
did
alive
or
dead
after
this
i
shall
always
appreciate
and
admire
him
for
the
way
he
made
money
since
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
fully
realized
what
it
could
buy
and
i
bought
things
first
i
went
to
see
madam
courtier
for
corsets
i
had
heard
about
her
and
i
knew
it
meant
a
fortune
but
that
did
matter
she
came
in
and
looked
at
me
for
about
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
and
then
she
ran
her
hands
down
and
down
over
me
until
i
could
feel
the
flesh
just
crawling
off
of
me
it
was
delicious
then
she
and
two
girls
in
puffs
and
rats
came
in
and
did
things
to
a
corset
they
laced
on
me
that
i
ca
even
write
down
for
i
understand
the
process
but
when
i
looked
in
that
long
glass
i
almost
dropped
on
the
floor
i
was
tight
and
i
was
stiff
and
i
looked
i
too
modest
to
write
how
lovely
i
really
looked
to
myself
i
was
spellbound
with
delight
illustration
i
was
spellbound
with
delight
next
i
signed
the
check
for
three
of
those
wonders
with
my
head
so
in
the
clouds
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
but
i
came
to
with
a
jolt
when
the
prettiest
girl
began
to
get
me
into
that
black
taffeta
bag
i
had
worn
down
to
the
city
i
must
have
shrunk
the
whole
remaining
pounds
i
had
felt
obliged
to
lose
for
alfred
and
ruth
chester
from
the
horror
i
felt
when
i
looked
at
myself
the
girl
was
really
sympathetic
and
said
with
a
smile
that
was
true
kindness
shall
i
call
a
taxi
for
madam
and
have
it
take
her
to
klein
they
have
wonderful
gowns
by
rene
all
ready
to
be
fitted
at
short
notice
really
madam
figure
is
such
that
it
commands
a
perfect
costume
now
men
do
business
well
but
when
women
enter
the
field
they
are
geniuses
at
money
extracting
i
felt
myself
already
clothed
perfectly
when
that
girl
said
my
figure
commanded
a
proper
dress
of
course
klein
pays
madam
courtier
a
commission
for
the
customers
she
passes
right
on
to
him
the
one
for
me
must
have
looked
to
her
like
a
real
estate
transaction
i
spent
three
days
at
the
great
klein
store
only
going
to
the
hotel
to
sleep
and
most
of
the
time
i
forgot
to
eat
madam
rene
must
have
been
madam
courtier
twin
sister
in
youth
and
madam
telliers
in
the
hat
department
was
the
triplet
to
them
both
when
women
have
genius
it
breaks
out
all
over
them
like
measles
and
they
never
recover
from
it
those
women
had
the
confluent
kind
but
i
know
that
old
rene
really
liked
me
for
when
i
blushed
and
asked
her
if
they
had
a
good
beauty
doctor
in
the
store
she
held
up
her
hands
and
shuddered
never
madam
never
it
is
to
fool
nevair
jamais
de
la
vie
i
had
to
calm
her
down
and
she
kissed
my
hand
when
we
parted
i
thought
klein
was
going
to
do
the
same
thing
or
worse
when
i
signed
the
check
which
would
be
good
for
a
house
and
lot
and
for
him
but
he
did
only
he
got
even
with
me
by
saying
and
i
am
delighted
that
the
trousseau
is
perfectly
satisfactory
to
you
mrs
carter
that
was
an
awful
shock
and
i
hope
i
did
show
it
as
i
murmured
perfectly
thank
you
the
word
trousseau
can
be
spoken
in
a
woman
presence
for
many
years
with
no
effect
but
it
is
an
awful
shock
when
she
first
hears
it
i
felt
funny
all
afternoon
as
i
packed
those
trunks
for
the
five
train
yes
the
word
trousseau
ought
to
have
a
definite
surname
after
it
always
and
that
why
my
loyalty
dragged
poor
carter
out
into
the
light
of
my
conscience
the
thinking
of
him
had
a
strange
effect
on
me
i
had
laid
out
the
dream
in
dark
rajah
tailored
almost
beyond
endurance
to
wear
home
on
the
train
and
had
thrown
the
old
black
taffeta
bag
across
the
chair
to
give
to
the
hotel
maid
but
the
decision
of
the
session
between
conscience
and
loyalty
made
me
pack
the
precious
blue
wonder
and
put
on
once
more
the
black
rags
of
remembrance
in
a
kind
of
panic
of
respect
i
would
lots
rather
have
bought
poor
carter
the
monument
i
have
been
planning
for
months
to
keep
up
conversation
with
aunt
adeline
than
wear
that
dress
again
i
felt
conscience
reprove
me
once
more
with
loyalty
looking
on
in
disapproval
as
i
buttoned
the
old
thing
up
for
the
last
time
because
i
really
ought
to
have
stayed
over
a
day
to
buy
that
monument
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
wanted
to
see
billy
so
desperately
that
his
above
my
heart
hurt
as
if
it
might
have
prickly
heat
break
out
at
any
minute
so
i
hurried
and
stuffed
the
darling
in
the
top
tray
lapped
old
black
taffeta
around
my
waist
and
belted
it
in
with
a
black
belt
off
a
new
green
linen
i
had
made
for
morning
walks
down
to
the
drug
store
on
the
public
square
i
suppose
that
is
about
the
only
morning
dissipation
in
hillsboro
that
i
can
think
of
and
it
all
depends
on
whom
you
meet
how
much
of
a
dissipation
it
is
the
next
thing
that
happens
after
you
have
done
a
noble
deed
is
you
either
regard
it
as
a
reward
of
virtue
or
as
a
punishment
for
having
been
foolish
i
felt
both
ways
when
judge
wade
came
down
the
car
aisle
looking
so
much
grander
than
any
other
man
in
sight
that
i
do
see
how
they
stand
him
ever
at
that
minute
the
noble
deed
felt
foolish
but
at
the
next
minute
i
thanked
my
lucky
stars
for
it
it
is
nice
to
watch
for
a
person
to
catch
sight
of
you
if
you
feel
sure
how
they
are
going
to
take
it
and
somehow
in
this
case
i
felt
sure
i
was
not
disappointed
for
his
smile
broke
his
face
up
into
a
off
came
his
hat
instantly
so
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fascinating
frost
over
his
temples
and
with
a
positive
sigh
of
rapture
he
subsided
into
the
seat
beside
me
i
turned
with
an
echo
smile
all
over
me
when
suddenly
his
face
became
grave
and
considerate
and
he
looked
at
me
as
all
the
men
in
hillsboro
have
been
doing
ever
since
poor
funeral
carter
he
said
very
kindly
in
a
voice
that
pitched
me
out
of
the
car
window
and
left
me
a
mile
behind
on
the
track
all
by
myself
i
wish
i
had
known
of
your
sad
errand
to
town
so
i
could
have
offered
you
some
assistance
in
your
selection
you
know
we
have
just
had
our
lot
in
the
cemetery
finally
arranged
and
i
found
the
dealers
in
memorial
stones
very
confusing
in
their
ideas
and
designs
henderson
just
told
my
mother
of
your
absence
from
home
last
night
and
i
could
only
come
down
to
the
city
for
the
day
on
important
business
or
i
would
have
arranged
to
see
you
i
hope
you
found
something
that
satisfied
you
what
a
woman
going
to
say
when
she
has
a
tombstone
thrown
in
her
face
like
that
i
did
say
anything
but
what
i
thought
about
aunt
adeline
filled
in
a
dreadful
pause
perfectly
dumb
and
quiet
i
sat
for
an
awful
space
of
time
and
wondered
just
what
i
was
going
to
do
could
a
woman
lie
a
monument
into
her
suit
case
it
was
beyond
me
at
that
speaking
and
the
molly
that
is
ready
for
life
quick
did
want
to
i
shut
my
eyes
counted
three
to
myself
as
i
do
when
i
go
over
into
the
cold
tub
and
told
him
all
about
it
we
both
got
a
satisfactory
reaction
and
i
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
as
that
before
i
understand
now
why
judge
wade
has
had
so
many
women
martyr
themselves
over
him
and
live
unhappily
ever
afterward
as
everybody
says
henrietta
mason
is
doing
he
a
very
inspiring
man
and
he
fairly
bristles
with
fascinations
some
men
are
what
you
call
taking
and
they
take
you
if
they
want
you
while
others
are
drawing
and
after
you
are
drawn
to
them
they
will
consider
the
question
of
taking
you
the
judge
is
like
that
in
the
meantime
it
tingles
me
up
to
a
very
great
degree
to
have
a
man
use
his
eyes
on
me
as
it
is
the
privilege
of
only
womankind
to
do
and
i
feel
that
it
will
be
good
for
his
judgeship
for
me
to
let
him
draw
me
at
least
a
little
way
i
may
get
hurt
but
i
shall
at
least
have
an
interesting
time
of
it
i
started
right
then
and
got
results
for
he
stopped
under
the
old
lilac
bush
that
leans
over
my
side
gate
and
kissed
my
hand
old
lilac
shook
a
laugh
of
perfume
all
over
us
and
i
believe
signaled
the
event
at
the
top
of
his
bough
to
the
white
clump
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
i
glad
aunt
adeline
is
in
the
flower
fraternity
or
sorority
suppose
she
had
seen
or
heard
and
it
did
take
many
minutes
for
me
to
slip
into
old
also
for
the
last
time
inside
of
those
buttons
and
run
through
the
garden
my
heart
singing
billy
billy
in
a
perfect
rapture
of
tune
i
ran
past
the
office
door
and
found
him
in
his
cot
almost
asleep
and
we
had
a
bear
reunion
in
the
rocker
by
the
window
that
made
us
both
breathless
what
did
you
bring
me
molly
he
finally
kissed
under
my
right
ear
a
real
and
bat
lover
and
an
engine
with
five
cars
a
rake
and
a
spade
and
a
hoe
two
that
pop
a
new
way
and
something
that
squirts
water
and
some
other
things
will
that
be
enough
i
hugged
him
up
anxiously
for
sometimes
he
is
hard
to
please
and
i
might
not
have
got
the
very
thing
he
wanted
thank
you
molly
all
them
things
is
what
i
want
but
you
oughter
brung
that
for
three
days
not
being
here
with
me
did
any
woman
ever
have
a
more
lovely
lover
than
that
i
do
know
how
long
i
should
have
rocked
him
in
the
twilight
if
doctor
john
voice
had
come
across
the
hall
in
command
put
him
down
now
molly
and
come
and
say
other
he
called
softly
it
was
a
funny
i
felt
as
i
came
into
the
office
where
he
was
standing
over
by
the
window
looking
out
at
my
garden
in
its
twilight
glow
i
think
it
is
wrong
for
a
woman
to
let
her
imagination
kiss
a
man
on
the
back
of
his
neck
even
if
she
has
known
for
some
time
that
there
is
a
little
lock
of
hair
there
just
like
his
own
son
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
a
good
deal
more
of
a
smile
and
a
blush
than
i
intended
he
very
far
from
kissed
the
hand
he
held
it
just
long
enough
to
turn
me
around
into
the
light
and
give
me
one
long
from
head
to
feet
just
where
does
that
corset
press
you
worst
he
asked
in
the
tone
of
voice
he
uses
to
say
poke
out
your
tongue
so
much
of
my
tennessee
rose
to
my
face
that
it
is
a
wonder
it
did
drip
but
i
was
cold
enough
to
have
hit
at
forty
paces
if
i
had
had
a
in
my
hand
as
it
was
the
coldness
was
the
only
missile
that
i
had
but
i
used
it
to
some
effect
i
am
making
a
call
on
a
friend
doctor
moore
and
not
a
consultation
visit
to
my
physician
i
said
looking
into
his
face
as
though
i
had
never
seen
him
before
i
beg
your
pardon
molly
he
exclaimed
and
his
face
was
redder
than
mine
and
then
it
went
white
with
mortification
i
could
stand
that
do
do
that
way
i
exclaimed
and
before
i
knew
it
i
had
taken
hold
of
his
hand
and
had
it
in
both
of
mine
i
know
i
look
as
if
i
was
shrunk
or
laced
but
i
not
i
was
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
show
it
to
you
i
really
inches
bigger
in
the
right
place
and
just
just
the
woman
called
it
in
the
wrong
place
please
feel
me
and
see
and
i
offered
myself
to
him
for
examination
in
the
most
regardless
way
he
not
at
all
like
other
people
the
blood
came
back
into
his
face
and
he
laughed
as
he
gave
me
a
little
shake
that
pushed
me
away
from
him
do
you
ever
scare
me
like
that
again
child
or
it
might
be
serious
he
said
in
the
tone
of
voice
that
i
like
some
only
i
never
will
i
said
in
a
hurry
i
want
you
to
ask
me
anything
in
the
world
you
want
to
and
i
always
do
it
well
let
me
take
you
home
through
the
garden
then
and
yes
i
believe
i
stay
to
break
a
muffin
with
henderson
do
you
want
to
tell
me
what
a
little
girl
like
you
did
in
a
big
city
and
and
read
me
part
of
that
london
letter
i
saw
the
postman
give
judy
this
afternoon
again
i
ask
myself
the
question
why
his
friendliness
to
alfred
letters
always
makes
me
so
instantly
cross
leaf
fourth
scattered
jam
sleep
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
and
undervalued
amusements
known
to
the
human
race
i
have
never
had
enough
yet
and
every
second
of
time
that
i
not
busy
with
something
interesting
i
curl
up
on
the
bed
and
go
dream
hunting
only
i
sleep
too
hard
to
do
much
catching
but
this
torture
book
found
that
out
on
me
and
stopped
it
the
very
first
thing
on
page
three
the
command
is
to
sleep
as
little
as
possible
to
keep
the
nerves
in
a
good
condition
eight
hours
at
the
most
and
seven
would
be
better
what
earthly
good
would
a
nap
do
me
i
want
ten
hours
to
sleep
and
twelve
if
i
get
a
good
tired
start
to
see
me
stagger
out
of
my
perfectly
nice
bed
at
six
every
morning
now
would
wring
the
sternest
heart
with
compassion
and
admiration
at
my
faithfulness
to
whom
yes
it
was
the
day
after
poor
carter
funeral
that
aunt
adeline
moved
up
here
into
my
house
and
settled
herself
in
the
big
south
room
across
the
hall
from
mine
her
furniture
weighs
a
ton
each
piece
and
aunt
adeline
is
not
light
herself
in
disposition
the
next
morning
when
i
went
in
to
breakfast
she
sat
in
the
vacant
chair
in
a
way
that
made
me
see
that
she
was
obviously
trying
to
fill
the
vacancy
i
am
sorry
she
worried
herself
about
that
anyway
it
made
me
take
a
resolve
after
breakfast
i
went
into
the
kitchen
to
speak
to
judy
judy
i
said
looking
past
her
head
my
health
is
not
very
good
and
you
can
bring
my
breakfast
to
me
in
bed
after
this
poor
carter
always
wanted
breakfast
on
the
stroke
of
seven
and
me
at
the
same
time
though
he
rarely
got
me
judy
has
two
dead
husbands
and
she
likes
a
barber
also
her
mother
is
our
washerwoman
and
influenced
by
aunt
adeline
judy
understands
everything
i
say
to
her
after
i
had
closed
the
door
i
heard
a
laugh
that
sounded
like
a
and
i
smiled
to
myself
but
that
was
before
my
martyrdom
to
this
book
had
begun
i
get
up
now
but
the
day
after
i
came
from
the
city
i
lay
in
bed
just
as
long
as
i
wanted
to
and
ignored
the
thought
of
the
exercises
and
deep
breathing
and
the
icy
unsympathetic
tub
i
could
even
take
very
much
interest
in
the
lonely
egg
on
the
lonely
slice
of
dry
toast
i
was
thinking
about
things
hillsboro
is
a
very
peculiar
little
speck
on
the
universe
even
more
peculiar
than
being
like
a
hen
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
towns
in
tennessee
and
the
moss
on
it
is
so
thick
that
it
ca
be
scratched
off
except
in
spots
but
it
has
a
lot
of
racehorse
and
distillery
money
in
it
and
when
it
gets
poked
up
by
anything
unusual
it
takes
a
gulp
of
its
own
alcoholic
atmosphere
and
runs
away
on
its
own
track
at
a
gait
shedding
moss
as
it
goes
it
has
had
a
real
for
a
long
time
and
i
felt
that
it
needed
it
i
rolled
over
and
laughed
into
my
pillow
the
subject
of
the
conduct
of
widows
is
a
serious
one
of
all
the
things
old
tradition
is
most
set
about
it
is
that
and
what
was
decided
to
be
the
proper
thing
a
million
years
ago
this
town
still
dictates
shall
be
done
and
spends
a
good
deal
of
its
time
seeing
its
directions
carried
out
for
a
year
after
the
funeral
they
forget
about
the
poor
bereaved
and
when
they
do
remember
her
they
speak
to
and
of
her
in
the
same
tones
of
voice
they
used
at
the
obsequies
then
sooner
or
later
some
neighbor
is
sure
to
see
some
man
walk
home
from
church
with
her
or
hear
some
old
bachelor
voice
on
her
front
porch
cain
took
little
jessie
up
in
his
buggy
and
helped
her
out
at
her
mother
gate
just
before
last
christmas
and
if
the
poor
widow
had
acted
quick
the
town
would
have
noticed
them
to
death
before
he
proposed
to
her
they
were
married
the
day
after
new
year
and
she
lost
lots
of
good
friends
because
she
did
give
them
more
time
to
talk
about
it
i
do
intend
to
run
any
risk
of
losing
my
friends
that
way
and
i
want
them
to
have
all
the
good
time
they
can
get
out
of
it
i
going
to
serve
out
of
excitement
until
the
dear
old
place
is
running
as
it
did
when
it
was
a
why
get
mad
when
people
are
interested
in
you
it
a
compliment
after
all
and
just
gives
them
more
to
think
about
i
remembered
the
two
trunks
across
the
hall
and
hugged
my
knees
up
under
by
chin
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
the
they
contained
then
just
as
i
had
got
the
first
plan
and
was
deciding
whether
to
wear
the
mauve
meteor
or
the
white
chiffon
with
the
rosebud
embroidery
as
a
first
julep
for
my
friends
a
sweetness
came
in
through
my
window
that
took
my
breath
away
and
i
lay
still
with
my
hand
over
my
heart
and
listened
it
was
billy
singing
right
under
my
window
and
never
heard
him
do
it
before
in
all
his
five
years
it
was
the
dearest
tune
ever
written
and
billy
sang
the
words
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
been
a
boy
chorister
doing
a
difficult
recitative
my
heart
beat
so
it
shook
the
lace
on
my
breast
like
a
breeze
from
heaven
as
he
took
the
high
note
and
then
let
it
go
on
the
last
few
words
if
you
love
me
molly
darling
let
your
answer
be
a
kiss
a
confused
recollection
of
having
heard
the
words
and
tune
sung
by
my
mother
when
i
was
at
the
rocking
age
myself
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
as
i
flew
to
the
window
and
parted
the
curtains
if
you
heard
a
little
singing
at
your
casement
would
you
expect
a
cherubim
face
upturned
with
all
over
it
billy
face
was
upturned
as
he
heard
me
draw
the
shade
but
it
was
streaked
like
a
wild
indian
with
decorations
of
brown
mud
and
he
held
a
long
slimy
on
the
end
of
a
stick
while
he
wiped
his
other
grimy
hand
down
the
front
of
his
linen
blouse
illustration
i
lifted
him
into
my
arms
say
molly
look
at
the
snake
i
brunged
you
he
exclaimed
as
he
came
close
under
the
sill
which
is
not
high
from
the
ground
if
you
put
your
face
down
to
the
mud
and
sing
something
to
they
come
outen
they
holes
a
comed
too
but
i
could
ketch
both
lift
me
up
and
i
can
put
him
in
the
on
your
table
he
held
up
one
muddy
paddie
to
me
and
promptly
i
lifted
him
up
into
my
arms
from
the
embrace
in
which
he
and
the
worm
and
i
indulged
my
lace
and
dimity
came
out
much
the
worse
that
was
a
lovely
song
you
sang
about
darling
billy
i
said
where
did
you
hear
it
that
a
good
molly
and
i
bet
i
can
git
a
lizard
with
it
too
if
i
sing
it
right
low
he
began
to
squirm
out
of
my
arms
toward
the
table
and
the
glass
who
taught
it
to
you
i
persisted
as
i
poured
water
in
on
the
squirming
worm
under
his
direction
nobody
taught
it
to
me
doc
sings
it
to
me
when
tilly
nurse
nor
you
ai
there
to
put
me
to
bed
he
do
know
no
good
songs
like
jordan
or
or
i
go
to
sleep
quick
he
makes
me
feel
tired
with
his
slow
tune
what
only
good
for
bugs
git
a
for
me
to
poke
him
with
molly
quick
i
found
the
and
i
do
know
why
my
hand
trembled
as
i
handed
it
to
billy
as
soon
as
he
got
it
he
climbed
out
the
window
glass
bug
and
all
and
i
saw
him
and
the
red
setter
go
down
the
garden
walk
together
in
pursuit
of
the
desired
lizard
i
suppose
i
closed
the
blinds
and
drew
the
curtains
again
and
flung
myself
on
my
pillow
something
warm
and
sweet
seemed
to
be
sweeping
over
me
in
great
waves
and
i
felt
young
and
close
up
to
some
sort
of
big
it
was
delicious
and
i
do
know
how
long
i
would
have
stayed
there
just
feeling
it
if
judy
had
brought
in
my
letter
he
had
written
from
london
and
it
was
many
pages
of
wonderful
things
all
flavored
with
me
he
told
me
about
miss
chester
and
what
good
friends
they
were
and
how
much
he
hoped
she
would
be
in
hillsboro
when
he
got
here
he
said
that
a
great
many
of
her
dainty
ways
reminded
him
of
his
own
slip
of
a
girl
especially
the
turn
of
her
head
like
a
flower
on
its
stem
at
that
i
got
right
out
of
bed
like
a
jack
jumping
out
of
a
box
and
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
there
is
one
exercise
here
on
page
twenty
that
i
hate
worst
of
all
you
screw
up
your
face
tight
until
you
look
like
a
christmas
mask
to
get
your
neck
muscles
taut
and
then
wobble
your
head
around
like
a
baby
until
it
swims
i
did
that
one
twenty
extra
times
and
all
the
others
in
proportion
to
make
up
for
those
two
hours
in
bed
hereafter
i
get
up
at
the
time
directed
on
page
three
or
maybe
earlier
it
frightens
me
to
think
that
i
got
only
a
few
weeks
more
to
turn
from
a
into
a
lily
i
wo
let
myself
even
think
luscious
peach
and
if
i
do
i
get
warm
and
happy
all
over
and
let
up
on
myself
i
try
when
i
get
hungry
to
think
of
myself
in
that
blue
muslin
dress
i
have
been
really
willing
before
to
write
down
in
this
torture
volume
that
i
took
that
garment
to
the
city
with
me
and
what
madam
rene
did
to
it
made
it
over
into
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
saw
only
i
would
let
her
alter
the
size
one
single
inch
i
honorable
as
all
women
are
at
peculiar
times
i
think
she
understood
but
she
seemed
not
to
and
worked
a
miracle
on
it
with
ribbon
and
lace
i
put
it
away
on
the
top
shelf
of
a
closet
for
it
is
torment
to
look
at
it
you
can
just
take
any
old
recipe
for
a
party
and
mix
up
a
début
for
a
girl
but
it
takes
more
time
to
concoct
one
for
a
widow
especially
if
it
is
for
yourself
i
spent
all
the
rest
of
the
day
doing
almost
nothing
and
thinking
until
i
felt
lightheaded
finally
i
had
just
about
given
up
any
idea
of
a
blaze
and
had
decided
to
leak
out
in
general
society
as
quietly
as
my
clothes
would
let
me
when
a
real
conflagration
was
lighted
inside
me
if
tom
pollard
was
my
own
first
cousin
i
would
have
loved
him
desperately
even
if
i
am
a
week
older
than
he
he
was
about
the
only
oasis
in
my
marriage
mirage
though
i
do
think
anybody
would
think
of
calling
him
at
all
green
he
never
stopped
coming
to
see
me
occasionally
and
carter
liked
him
he
was
the
first
man
to
notice
the
white
ruche
i
sewed
in
the
neck
of
my
old
black
taffeta
four
or
five
months
ago
and
he
let
me
see
that
he
noticed
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
even
right
there
in
church
under
aunt
adeline
very
elbow
he
makes
love
unconsciously
and
he
flirts
with
his
own
mother
as
soon
as
i
made
this
widowhood
hurdle
well
i
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
buying
tobacco
with
him
in
his
hup
runabout
which
sounds
as
if
it
was
named
for
himself
and
when
that
conflagration
was
lighted
in
me
about
my
début
tom
did
it
i
was
sitting
peaceably
on
my
own
front
steps
dressed
in
the
that
judy
washes
and
irons
every
day
while
deciding
how
to
hand
out
the
first
sip
of
my
trousseau
to
the
neighbors
when
tom
in
a
dangerous
shirt
with
a
tie
that
melted
into
it
in
tone
blew
over
my
hedge
and
landed
at
my
side
he
kissed
the
lace
ruffle
on
my
sleeve
while
i
reproved
him
severely
and
settled
down
to
enjoy
him
but
i
did
have
such
an
awfully
good
time
as
i
generally
do
with
him
he
was
too
full
of
another
woman
and
even
a
first
cousin
can
be
an
exasperation
in
that
condition
now
molly
truly
did
you
ever
see
such
a
peach
as
she
is
he
demanded
after
i
had
expressed
more
than
a
dozen
delighted
opinions
of
miss
chester
his
use
of
the
word
peach
riled
me
and
before
i
stopped
to
think
i
said
she
reminds
me
more
of
a
now
molly
do
be
mean
just
because
old
wade
has
got
her
out
driving
behind
the
grays
after
kissing
your
hand
under
the
lilacs
yesterday
which
praise
be
nobody
saw
but
little
me
i
not
sore
why
should
you
be
are
you
happy
with
me
i
withered
him
with
a
look
or
rather
to
wither
him
for
tom
is
no
mimosa
bud
the
way
that
girl
has
started
in
to
wake
up
this
little
old
town
reminds
me
of
the
feeling
you
get
under
your
belt
seven
minutes
after
you
sipped
an
absinthe
frappé
for
the
first
time
you
are
liable
for
a
good
jag
and
do
know
it
he
continued
enthusiastically
do
let
the
folks
know
that
they
are
off
until
i
get
everybody
in
a
full
swing
of
buzz
over
my
queen
i
had
never
seen
tom
so
enthusiastic
over
a
girl
before
and
i
did
like
it
but
i
decided
not
to
let
him
know
that
but
to
get
to
work
putting
out
the
chester
blaze
in
him
and
starting
one
on
my
own
account
that
just
what
i
thinking
about
tom
i
said
with
a
smile
that
was
as
sweet
as
i
could
make
it
and
as
she
came
with
messages
to
me
from
one
of
my
best
old
friends
i
think
i
ought
to
do
something
to
make
her
have
a
good
time
i
was
just
planning
a
gorgeous
i
want
to
have
for
her
when
you
came
so
suddenly
do
you
think
we
could
arrange
it
for
tuesday
evening
lord
love
us
molly
do
knock
the
town
down
like
that
let
have
more
than
a
week
to
get
used
to
this
white
rag
of
a
dress
you
been
waving
in
their
faces
for
the
last
few
days
go
slow
i
been
going
so
slow
for
so
many
years
that
i
turned
around
and
i
going
fast
backward
i
said
with
a
blush
that
i
could
help
help
let
my
kinship
protect
me
exclaimed
tom
in
alarm
and
he
pretended
to
move
an
inch
away
from
me
yes
i
said
slowly
and
as
i
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eyes
from
under
the
lashes
that
tom
himself
had
once
told
me
were
too
long
and
black
to
be
tidy
i
saw
that
he
was
in
a
condition
to
get
the
full
shock
if
anybody
wakes
up
this
town
it
will
be
i
i
said
as
i
flung
down
the
gauntlet
with
a
high
head
here
molly
here
are
the
keys
of
my
office
and
the
to
the
hup
you
can
cut
off
a
lock
of
my
hair
and
if
judy
has
got
a
cake
eat
it
out
of
your
hands
shall
it
be
california
or
nova
scotia
and
i
prefer
bride
served
in
light
gray
tweed
tom
really
is
adorable
and
i
let
him
snuggle
up
just
one
cousinly
second
then
we
both
laughed
and
began
to
plan
what
tom
was
horrible
enough
to
call
the
resurrection
razoo
but
i
kept
that
delicious
treasure
all
to
myself
i
wanted
him
to
meet
it
entirely
unprepared
i
was
glad
we
had
both
got
over
our
excitement
and
were
sitting
decorously
at
several
inches
distance
apart
when
the
judge
drew
the
grays
up
to
the
gate
and
we
both
went
down
to
the
sidewalk
to
ask
him
and
the
lovely
long
lady
to
come
in
they
could
but
we
stood
and
talked
to
them
long
enough
for
johnson
to
get
a
good
look
at
us
from
across
the
street
and
i
was
afraid
i
would
find
aunt
adeline
in
a
faint
when
i
went
into
the
house
miss
chester
was
delightfully
gracious
about
the
dinner
i
almost
called
it
the
début
dinner
and
the
expression
on
the
judge
face
when
he
accepted
i
was
glad
she
was
sitting
sidewise
to
him
and
could
see
some
women
like
to
make
other
women
unhappy
but
i
think
it
is
best
for
you
to
keep
them
blissfully
unconscious
until
you
get
what
you
want
anyway
i
like
that
girl
all
over
and
i
ca
see
that
her
neck
is
so
absolutely
impossibly
flowery
however
i
think
she
might
have
been
a
little
more
considerate
about
discussing
alfred
london
triumph
over
the
italian
mission
as
a
punishment
i
let
tom
put
his
arm
around
my
waist
as
we
stood
watching
them
drive
off
and
then
was
sorry
for
the
left
gray
horse
that
shied
and
came
in
for
a
crack
of
the
irritated
whip
then
i
refused
to
let
tom
come
inside
the
gate
and
he
went
down
the
street
whistling
only
when
he
got
to
the
purple
lilac
he
turned
and
kissed
his
hand
to
me
that
johnson
just
could
stand
and
she
came
across
the
street
immediately
and
called
me
back
to
the
gate
you
are
tempting
providence
molly
carter
she
exclaimed
decidedly
do
you
know
tom
pollard
is
nothing
but
a
as
a
husband
he
chew
the
rope
and
run
away
like
a
puppy
the
first
time
your
back
was
turned
besides
being
your
cousin
he
younger
than
you
what
do
you
mean
he
just
a
week
younger
johnson
and
i
would
tie
him
for
worlds
even
if
i
married
him
i
said
meekly
somehow
i
like
johnson
enough
to
be
meek
with
her
and
it
always
brings
her
to
a
higher
point
of
excitement
tie
nonsense
marrying
is
roping
in
with
ball
and
chain
to
my
mind
and
a
week
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
their
cradles
gets
to
be
fifteen
years
between
them
and
their
graves
i
going
to
make
you
the
subject
of
a
silent
prayer
at
the
next
missionary
meeting
and
i
must
go
home
now
to
see
that
sally
cooks
up
a
few
of
johnson
crotchets
for
supper
and
she
began
to
hurry
away
i
do
believe
you
be
able
to
make
it
a
session
about
me
johnson
i
called
after
her
and
she
laughed
back
from
her
own
front
gate
marriage
is
the
only
worm
in
the
bud
of
johnson
life
and
her
laugh
has
a
snap
to
it
even
if
it
is
not
very
sugary
sweet
when
i
told
judy
about
the
and
asked
her
to
get
the
yellow
barber
to
come
help
her
and
her
nephew
wait
on
the
table
she
grinned
such
a
wide
grin
that
i
was
afraid
of
being
swallowed
she
understood
that
aunt
adeline
would
be
interested
in
it
until
i
had
time
to
tell
her
all
about
it
anyway
she
will
be
going
over
to
springfield
on
a
pilgrimage
to
see
henderson
sister
next
week
she
does
know
it
yet
but
i
do
after
that
i
spent
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
planning
my
and
i
had
a
most
royal
good
time
i
always
have
had
lots
of
company
but
mostly
the
kind
with
relatives
or
more
relatives
to
supper
that
what
most
entertaining
in
hillsboro
is
like
but
as
i
say
once
in
a
while
the
old
slow
pacer
wakes
up
i
never
forget
my
first
real
as
the
flower
girl
for
caroline
evans
wedding
when
she
married
the
chicago
millionaire
from
which
hillsboro
has
never
yet
recovered
i
was
sixteen
felt
dreadfully
naked
without
a
tucker
in
my
dress
and
saw
alfred
for
the
first
time
in
evening
clothes
his
first
i
can
hardly
stand
thinking
about
how
he
looked
even
now
i
have
been
to
very
many
in
my
life
but
from
this
time
on
i
mean
to
indulge
in
them
often
pretty
women
shoulders
black
coat
sleeves
cut
glass
and
flowers
are
good
ingredients
for
a
and
why
not
but
when
i
got
to
planning
about
the
gorgeous
food
i
wanted
to
give
them
all
i
got
into
what
i
feel
came
near
being
a
serious
trouble
it
was
writing
down
the
recipe
for
the
nesselrode
pudding
they
make
in
my
family
that
undid
me
suddenly
hunger
rose
up
from
nowhere
and
gripped
me
by
the
throat
gnawed
me
all
over
like
a
bone
then
shook
me
until
i
was
limp
and
unresisting
i
must
have
astralized
myself
down
to
the
pantry
for
when
i
became
conscious
i
found
myself
in
company
with
a
loaf
of
bread
a
plate
of
butter
and
a
huge
jar
of
jam
i
sat
down
by
the
long
table
by
the
window
and
slowly
prepared
to
enjoy
myself
i
cut
off
four
slices
and
buttered
them
to
an
equal
thickness
and
then
more
slowly
put
a
long
silver
spoon
into
the
jam
i
even
paused
to
admire
in
judy
mirror
over
the
table
the
effect
of
the
cascade
of
lace
that
fell
across
my
arm
and
lost
itself
in
the
blue
shimmer
of
old
rene
masterpiece
of
a
negligée
then
deep
down
i
buried
the
spoon
in
the
purple
sweetness
i
had
just
lifted
it
high
in
the
air
when
out
of
the
dark
of
the
garden
came
a
laugh
illustration
why
molly
molly
molly
why
molly
molly
molly
drawled
that
miserable
as
he
came
and
leaned
on
the
sill
right
close
to
my
elbow
the
spoon
crashed
on
the
table
and
i
turned
and
crashed
into
words
you
are
cruel
cruel
john
moore
and
i
hate
you
worse
than
i
ever
did
before
if
that
is
possible
i
hungry
hungry
to
death
and
now
spoiled
it
all
go
away
before
i
wet
this
nice
crisp
bread
and
jam
with
tears
into
a
mush
i
have
to
eat
with
a
spoon
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
want
something
sweet
so
bad
you
are
willing
to
steal
it
from
yourself
i
fairly
blazed
my
eyes
down
into
his
and
moved
as
far
away
from
him
as
the
table
would
let
me
do
i
molly
he
asked
softly
after
looking
straight
in
my
eyes
for
a
long
minute
that
made
me
drop
my
head
until
the
blue
bow
i
had
tied
on
the
end
of
my
long
plait
almost
got
into
the
scattered
jam
even
at
such
a
moment
as
that
i
felt
how
glad
old
rene
would
have
been
to
have
given
such
a
nice
man
as
the
doctor
a
treat
like
that
blue
silk
of
hers
i
was
glad
myself
do
i
peaches
he
asked
again
in
a
still
softer
voice
again
i
had
that
sensation
of
being
against
something
warm
and
great
and
good
like
your
own
mother
breast
and
i
do
know
how
i
controlled
it
enough
not
to
to
well
have
some
jam
then
i
managed
to
say
with
a
little
laugh
as
i
turned
away
and
picked
up
the
silver
spoon
thank
you
i
will
all
of
it
and
the
bread
and
butter
too
he
answered
in
that
detestable
friendly
tone
of
voice
as
he
drew
himself
up
and
sat
in
the
window
hustle
peaches
if
you
are
going
to
feed
me
for
i
ravenous
it
took
sam
benson
wife
the
longest
time
to
have
the
shortest
baby
i
ever
experienced
and
i
have
had
any
supper
you
have
so
i
do
mind
taking
it
all
away
from
you
supper
i
sniffed
as
i
spread
the
jam
on
those
lovely
lovely
slices
of
bread
and
thick
butter
that
i
had
fixed
for
my
own
self
that
combination
tires
me
so
now
that
i
forget
it
if
i
can
as
i
handed
him
the
first
slice
of
drippy
lusciousness
i
turned
my
head
away
he
thought
it
was
from
the
expression
of
that
jam
but
it
was
from
his
eyes
slice
up
the
whole
loaf
peaches
and
let
get
on
a
jam
jag
come
with
me
just
this
once
and
forget
forget
he
did
finish
his
sentence
and
i
glad
we
neither
of
us
said
anything
more
as
i
fed
him
that
whole
loaf
i
found
that
the
bite
i
took
off
of
each
piece
i
had
ready
for
him
when
he
finished
with
the
one
he
had
in
hand
satisfied
me
as
nothing
i
had
ever
eaten
in
all
my
life
before
had
done
while
at
the
same
time
my
nibbles
soothed
his
conscience
about
robbing
me
his
teeth
are
big
and
strong
and
white
and
his
jaws
work
like
machinery
he
is
the
strongest
man
i
ever
saw
and
his
gauntness
is
all
muscle
what
is
that
glow
a
woman
gets
from
feeding
a
hungry
man
whom
she
likes
with
her
own
hands
and
why
should
i
want
to
be
certain
that
he
kissed
the
lace
on
my
sleeve
as
it
brushed
his
face
when
i
reached
across
him
to
catch
an
inquisitive
rose
that
i
saw
peeping
in
the
window
at
us
leaf
fifth
blue
absinthe
the
juice
of
a
lemon
in
two
glasses
of
cold
water
to
be
drunk
immediately
on
wakening
page
eleven
i
handed
myself
that
lemon
every
morning
now
until
i
am
sensitive
with
myself
about
it
if
there
was
ever
anybody
on
the
water
wagon
it
i
and
i
have
to
sit
on
the
front
seat
from
dawn
to
dusk
to
get
in
the
gallon
of
water
i
supposed
to
consume
in
that
time
sometime
i
going
to
get
mixed
up
and
try
to
drink
my
bath
if
i
do
look
out
i
dreamed
night
before
last
that
i
was
taking
a
bath
in
a
glass
of
and
trying
to
hide
from
doctor
john
behind
the
dab
of
that
seemed
inadequate
for
food
or
protection
i
have
had
even
one
glass
for
two
months
and
i
woke
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
of
embarrassment
and
raging
hunger
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
about
this
book
and
i
got
myself
into
trouble
about
writing
things
besides
records
in
it
he
looked
at
me
this
morning
as
coolly
as
if
i
was
just
anybody
and
said
i
would
like
to
see
that
record
now
molly
it
seems
to
me
you
are
about
as
slim
as
you
want
to
be
how
did
you
tip
the
scales
last
time
you
weighed
and
have
you
noticed
any
trouble
at
all
with
your
heart
i
weigh
one
hundred
and
pounds
and
i
got
to
melt
and
freeze
and
starve
off
that
four
i
answered
ignoring
the
heart
question
and
also
the
question
of
producing
this
book
wonder
what
he
would
do
if
i
gave
it
to
him
to
read
just
as
it
is
how
about
the
heart
he
persisted
and
i
may
have
imagined
the
smile
in
his
eyes
for
his
mouth
was
purely
professional
anyway
i
lowered
my
lashes
down
on
to
my
cheeks
and
answered
experimentally
sometimes
it
hurts
then
a
cyclone
happened
to
me
come
here
to
me
a
minute
he
said
quickly
and
he
turned
me
around
and
put
his
head
down
between
my
shoulders
and
held
me
so
tight
against
his
ear
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
expand
your
chest
three
times
and
breathe
as
deep
as
you
can
he
ordered
from
against
my
back
buttons
i
expanded
and
breathed
pretty
quickly
at
that
illustration
breathe
as
deep
as
you
can
now
hold
your
breath
as
long
as
you
can
he
commanded
and
it
fitted
my
mood
exactly
to
do
so
ca
find
anything
he
said
at
last
letting
me
go
and
looking
carefully
at
my
face
his
eyes
were
all
anxiety
and
i
liked
it
when
does
it
hurt
you
and
how
he
asked
anxiously
moonlight
nights
and
lonesomely
i
answered
before
i
could
stop
myself
and
what
happened
then
was
worse
than
any
cyclone
he
got
white
for
a
minute
and
just
looked
at
me
as
if
i
was
a
bug
stuck
on
a
pin
then
gave
a
short
little
laugh
and
turned
to
the
table
i
did
understand
you
were
joking
he
said
quietly
that
maddened
me
and
i
would
have
done
anything
to
make
him
think
i
was
not
the
foolish
thing
he
evidently
had
classified
me
as
being
i
snatched
at
my
mind
and
shook
out
a
mixture
of
truth
and
lies
that
fooled
even
myself
and
gave
them
to
him
looking
straight
in
his
face
i
would
have
cracked
all
the
ten
commandments
to
save
myself
from
his
contempt
i
not
joking
i
said
jerkily
i
lonesome
and
worse
than
being
lonesome
i
scared
i
ought
to
have
stayed
just
the
quiet
relict
of
carter
and
gone
on
to
church
meetings
with
aunt
adeline
and
let
myself
be
fat
and
respectable
but
i
have
got
the
character
you
thought
i
went
to
town
to
buy
a
monument
and
i
did
i
bought
enough
clothes
for
two
brides
and
now
i
scared
to
wear
and
i
do
know
what
you
think
when
you
see
my
everybody
is
talking
about
me
and
that
tuesday
night
and
aunt
adeline
says
she
live
in
a
house
of
mourning
so
desecrated
any
longer
she
going
back
to
the
cottage
aunt
bettie
pollard
says
that
if
i
want
to
get
married
i
ought
to
do
it
to
wilson
graves
because
of
the
seven
children
and
then
everybody
would
be
so
relieved
that
they
are
taken
care
of
that
they
would
forget
that
carter
has
been
dead
quite
one
year
yet
johnson
says
i
ought
to
be
declared
a
minor
and
put
as
a
ward
to
you
i
ca
help
judge
wade
sending
me
flowers
and
tom
sitting
on
my
front
steps
night
and
day
i
not
strong
enough
to
carry
him
away
and
murder
him
i
am
perfectly
miserable
and
i
now
that
do
molly
just
hush
for
a
and
let
me
talk
to
you
said
doctor
john
as
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
drew
me
near
him
no
wonder
your
heart
hurts
if
it
has
got
all
that
load
of
trouble
on
it
and
well
just
get
a
little
of
that
off
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
and
you
are
to
do
just
as
i
tell
you
and
i
say
forget
it
come
with
me
while
i
make
a
call
it
is
a
long
drive
and
i
i
lonesome
sometimes
myself
i
saw
the
worst
was
over
and
i
breathed
freely
again
but
i
had
talked
so
much
truth
in
that
fiction
that
i
felt
just
as
i
said
i
did
which
is
a
slightly
unnatural
feeling
for
a
woman
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
with
him
and
i
wanted
to
most
awfully
to
my
dying
day
i
never
forget
that
little
house
way
out
on
the
cane
run
pike
he
took
me
to
in
his
shabby
little
car
just
two
tiny
rooms
but
they
were
clean
and
quiet
and
a
girl
with
the
sweetest
face
i
ever
saw
lay
in
the
bed
with
her
eyes
bright
with
pride
and
a
tiny
tiny
little
bundle
close
beside
her
the
young
farmer
was
red
with
embarrassment
and
anxiety
she
all
right
but
she
worries
because
she
do
think
i
can
tend
to
the
baby
right
he
said
and
he
did
look
helpless
her
mother
had
to
go
home
for
two
days
but
is
coming
i
das
undress
and
wash
the
youngster
myself
it
wo
hurt
him
to
stay
bundled
up
until
granny
comes
will
it
doc
not
a
bit
answered
doctor
john
in
his
big
comforting
voice
but
i
looked
at
the
girl
and
i
understood
her
she
wanted
that
baby
clean
and
fresh
even
if
it
was
just
five
days
old
and
i
felt
all
of
a
sudden
terribly
capable
i
picked
up
the
bundle
and
went
into
the
other
room
with
it
where
a
kettle
was
boiling
on
the
stove
and
a
large
bucket
by
the
door
i
found
things
by
just
a
glance
from
her
and
the
hour
i
spent
with
that
small
baby
was
one
of
the
most
delicious
of
all
my
life
i
never
was
left
entirely
to
myself
with
one
before
and
i
did
all
i
wanted
to
this
one
guided
by
instinct
and
desire
he
slept
right
through
and
was
the
darlingest
thing
i
ever
saw
when
i
laid
him
back
on
the
bed
by
her
i
never
looked
in
doctor
john
direction
once
though
i
felt
him
all
the
time
but
on
the
way
home
i
gave
myself
the
surprise
of
my
life
suddenly
i
turned
my
face
against
his
sleeve
and
cried
as
i
never
had
before
i
felt
safe
for
it
is
a
cliff
road
and
he
had
to
drive
carefully
however
he
managed
to
press
that
one
arm
against
my
cheek
in
a
way
that
comforted
me
into
stopping
when
i
saw
we
were
near
town
i
got
out
of
the
car
at
the
garage
and
walked
away
through
the
garden
home
without
looking
in
his
direction
at
all
i
never
seem
to
be
able
to
look
at
him
as
i
do
at
other
people
we
had
spoken
two
words
since
we
had
left
the
little
house
in
the
woods
with
that
girl
in
it
he
has
more
sense
than
just
a
man
it
was
almost
dusk
and
i
stopped
in
the
garden
a
minute
to
pull
the
dirt
closer
around
some
of
the
that
had
popped
the
ground
some
weeks
ago
thinking
about
them
made
me
regain
my
spirits
and
i
went
on
in
the
house
to
be
scolded
for
whatever
aunt
adeline
had
thought
up
while
i
was
gone
to
do
it
to
me
about
judy
told
me
with
her
broadest
grin
that
she
had
gone
down
to
her
for
supper
and
i
sat
down
on
the
steps
with
a
sigh
of
relief
some
days
are
like
tin
cocoanut
graters
that
everybody
uses
to
grate
you
against
and
this
was
one
for
me
for
an
hour
i
sat
and
grated
my
own
self
against
alfred
letter
that
had
come
in
the
morning
i
realized
that
i
would
just
have
to
come
to
some
sort
of
decision
about
what
i
was
going
to
do
for
he
wrote
that
he
was
to
sail
in
a
day
or
two
and
ships
do
travel
so
fast
these
days
i
love
him
and
always
have
of
that
i
am
sure
he
offers
me
the
most
wonderful
life
in
the
world
and
no
woman
could
help
being
proud
to
accept
it
i
am
lonely
more
lonely
than
i
was
even
willing
to
confess
to
doctor
john
i
ca
go
on
living
this
way
any
longer
ruth
chester
has
made
me
see
that
if
i
want
alfred
it
will
be
now
or
never
and
quick
i
know
now
that
she
loves
him
and
she
ought
to
have
her
show
if
i
do
want
him
the
way
she
idolizes
and
idealizes
him
is
a
marvel
of
womanly
stupidity
some
women
like
to
collect
men
hearts
and
hide
them
away
from
other
women
on
cold
storage
and
the
helpless
things
ca
help
themselves
i
have
contempt
for
that
sort
of
butcher
and
i
love
ruth
it
my
duty
to
look
the
matter
in
the
face
before
i
look
in
alfred
and
if
not
alfred
what
then
first
no
husband
that
out
of
the
question
i
not
enough
to
crank
my
own
and
study
woman
suffrage
i
prefer
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
some
cruel
man
and
trust
to
beguiling
him
into
doing
just
as
i
say
i
like
men
ca
help
it
and
want
one
for
my
own
i
do
count
poor
carter
second
if
not
alfred
who
judge
wade
is
so
delightful
that
i
flutter
at
the
thought
but
his
mother
is
aunt
adeline
own
best
friend
and
they
have
ideas
in
common
she
is
so
religious
that
living
with
her
would
be
like
having
the
sacrament
for
daily
bread
still
living
with
him
might
have
adventures
i
never
saw
such
eyes
the
girl
he
wanted
to
marry
died
of
tuberculosis
and
he
wears
a
locket
with
her
in
it
yet
like
to
reward
him
for
such
faithfulness
with
a
nice
husky
wife
to
wear
instead
of
the
locket
but
then
alfred
been
faithful
too
i
look
at
ruth
chester
and
realize
how
faithful
and
my
heart
melts
to
him
in
my
breast
my
hips
have
almost
all
melted
away
too
so
i
had
better
keep
the
heart
cold
enough
to
handle
if
i
want
anything
left
at
all
for
him
to
come
home
to
in
some
ways
tom
pollard
is
the
most
congenial
man
i
ever
knew
you
have
to
say
do
to
him
all
the
time
but
what
woman
does
like
a
little
impertinence
once
in
a
while
i
flavor
all
tom
kisses
with
kinship
when
i
feed
them
to
my
conscience
and
i
truly
try
to
make
him
be
serious
about
the
important
things
in
life
like
going
to
church
with
his
mother
and
working
all
day
even
if
he
is
rich
i
wish
he
was
so
near
kin
to
me
now
there
i
feel
in
ruth
chester
way
again
one
of
the
things
that
keeps
the
devil
so
busy
is
taking
helpless
widows
to
the
heights
of
knowledge
and
showing
them
kingdoms
of
men
that
girls
never
dream
even
exist
if
all
women
could
have
been
born
with
things
would
run
much
more
smoothly
along
the
marriage
and
line
and
the
poor
men
are
most
of
them
as
ignorant
as
girls
about
what
to
do
i
suppose
i
really
would
be
doing
a
righteous
thing
to
marry
graves
and
i
would
adore
all
those
children
to
start
with
but
i
know
billy
would
get
on
with
them
at
all
i
ca
even
consider
it
on
his
account
but
i
let
the
nice
old
chap
come
on
for
a
few
times
more
to
see
me
for
he
really
is
interesting
and
we
have
suffered
things
in
common
graves
lacked
the
kind
of
temperament
poor
carter
did
i
like
to
make
it
all
up
to
him
but
if
billy
would
be
happy
that
settles
it
and
i
do
know
how
good
his
boys
are
i
could
have
billy
corrupted
and
so
as
there
is
nobody
else
exactly
suitable
in
town
it
all
simmers
down
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
or
alfred
in
my
heart
i
knew
that
i
could
hesitate
a
minute
and
in
the
flash
of
a
second
i
of
course
i
love
alfred
and
i
take
him
gladly
and
be
the
wife
he
has
waited
for
all
these
six
lonely
years
i
make
everything
up
to
him
if
i
have
to
diet
to
keep
thin
for
him
the
rest
of
my
life
i
likely
will
have
that
very
thing
to
do
and
i
get
weak
at
the
idea
before
i
burn
this
book
i
have
to
copy
it
all
out
and
be
chained
to
it
for
life
at
the
thought
my
heart
dropped
like
a
sinker
to
my
toes
but
i
hauled
it
up
to
its
normal
place
with
picturing
to
myself
how
alfred
would
look
when
he
saw
me
in
that
old
blue
muslin
done
over
into
a
rene
wonder
however
old
heart
would
show
a
strange
propensity
for
sinking
down
into
my
slippers
without
any
reason
at
all
tears
were
even
coming
into
my
eyes
when
tom
suddenly
came
over
the
fence
and
picked
me
and
the
heart
up
together
and
put
us
into
an
adventure
of
the
first
water
molly
he
said
in
the
most
nonchalant
manner
imaginable
we
got
a
dandy
strolling
gipsy
band
up
at
the
hotel
the
floor
is
all
waxed
and
i
asking
for
the
first
dance
with
the
young
and
radiant
carter
get
into
a
glad
rag
and
do
keep
me
waiting
tom
i
gasped
oh
be
a
sport
moll
and
do
take
water
you
said
you
would
wake
up
this
town
and
now
do
it
it
seems
twenty
instead
of
six
years
since
i
had
my
arms
around
you
to
music
and
i
not
going
to
wait
any
longer
everybody
is
there
and
they
ca
all
dance
with
miss
chester
that
settled
it
i
could
let
a
visiting
girl
be
danced
to
death
of
course
i
had
planned
to
make
a
dignified
début
under
my
own
roof
backed
up
by
the
presence
of
ancestral
and
marital
rosewood
silver
and
mahogany
as
a
widow
should
but
called
me
to
myself
amidst
the
informality
of
an
impromptu
dance
at
the
little
town
hotel
and
in
the
fifteen
minutes
tom
gave
me
i
to
some
purpose
and
flowered
out
to
still
more
i
never
do
anything
by
halves
in
that
that
trousseau
old
rene
had
made
me
there
was
one
what
she
called
simple
lingerie
frock
and
it
looked
just
as
simple
as
the
check
it
called
for
a
one
and
two
ciphers
back
of
it
it
was
of
linen
as
sheer
as
a
cobweb
real
lace
and
tiny
delicious
incrustations
of
embroidery
it
fitted
in
lines
that
melted
into
curves
had
enticements
in
the
shape
of
a
long
sash
and
a
dangerous
of
shimmery
blue
the
color
of
my
eyes
and
i
looked
in
it
i
glad
that
poor
carter
was
so
stern
with
me
about
rats
and
things
in
my
hair
now
that
they
are
out
of
style
for
i
got
lots
of
my
own
left
in
consequence
of
not
wearing
other
peoples
it
clings
and
coils
to
my
head
just
any
old
way
that
looks
as
if
i
had
spent
an
hour
on
it
that
made
me
able
to
be
ready
to
go
down
to
tom
in
only
ten
minutes
over
the
time
he
gave
me
i
stopped
on
next
to
the
bottom
step
in
the
wide
old
hall
and
called
tom
to
turn
out
the
light
for
me
as
judy
had
gone
i
have
turned
out
that
light
lots
of
times
but
i
felt
it
best
to
let
tom
see
me
in
a
full
light
when
we
were
alone
it
is
well
i
did
at
first
it
stunned
him
and
it
is
a
compliment
to
any
woman
to
stun
tom
pollard
but
tom
does
stay
stunned
long
and
i
only
succeeded
in
suppressing
him
after
he
had
landed
two
kisses
on
my
shoulder
one
on
my
hair
and
one
on
the
back
of
my
neck
molly
he
said
standing
off
and
looking
at
me
with
shining
eyes
you
are
one
lovely
dream
your
shoulders
are
flushed
velvet
your
cheeks
are
peaches
under
cream
your
eyes
are
blue
absinthe
and
your
mouth
a
red
devil
come
on
before
i
get
drunk
looking
at
you
i
did
know
whether
i
liked
that
or
not
and
turned
down
the
light
quickly
myself
and
went
to
the
gate
hurriedly
tom
laughed
and
behaved
himself
illustration
molly
you
are
one
lovely
dream
everybody
in
town
was
up
to
the
hotel
and
everybody
was
nice
to
me
girls
and
all
there
is
a
bunch
of
lovely
posy
girls
in
this
town
and
they
were
all
in
full
flower
most
of
the
men
were
college
boys
home
for
vacation
and
while
they
are
a
few
years
younger
than
me
i
have
been
friends
with
them
for
always
and
they
know
how
i
dance
i
did
even
get
near
enough
to
the
wall
to
know
it
was
there
though
i
was
conscious
of
aunt
bettie
and
johnson
sitting
on
it
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
every
time
i
passed
them
i
flirted
with
them
until
i
won
a
smile
from
them
both
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
hearing
johnson
tell
aunt
adeline
all
about
it
and
it
was
well
i
did
come
to
save
ruth
chester
from
a
dancing
death
for
she
is
as
light
as
a
feather
and
sails
on
the
air
like
i
felt
sorry
for
tom
for
when
he
danced
with
me
he
could
see
her
and
when
he
danced
with
her
i
pouted
at
him
even
over
judge
wade
arm
i
verily
believe
it
was
from
being
really
rattled
that
he
asked
little
pet
buford
to
dance
with
him
by
mistake
as
it
were
after
that
if
pet
breathed
a
single
strain
of
music
out
of
his
arms
i
did
see
it
i
knew
that
gone
expression
on
his
face
and
it
made
me
feel
so
lonesome
that
i
was
more
gracious
to
the
judge
than
was
exactly
safe
he
dances
just
as
magnificently
as
he
exists
in
life
and
it
is
a
kind
of
ceremonial
to
do
it
with
him
the
boys
all
wore
white
flannels
and
most
of
the
men
but
the
judge
was
as
formally
dressed
as
he
would
have
been
in
and
i
wondered
if
alfred
could
be
half
as
distinguished
to
look
at
i
suppose
my
eyes
must
have
been
telling
on
me
about
how
grand
i
thought
he
was
looking
because
he
well
i
was
rather
relieved
when
one
of
the
boys
took
me
out
of
his
arms
for
a
good
long
swinging
and
how
i
did
enjoy
it
all
every
single
minute
of
it
my
heart
beat
time
to
the
music
as
if
it
would
never
tire
of
doing
so
miss
chester
and
i
exchanged
little
laughs
and
scraps
of
conversation
in
between
times
and
i
fell
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
with
her
every
pound
i
have
melted
and
frozen
and
starved
off
me
has
brought
me
nearer
to
her
and
i
just
think
about
how
i
am
going
to
hurt
her
in
a
few
days
now
i
put
the
thought
from
me
and
so
let
myself
swing
out
into
thoughtlessness
with
one
of
the
boys
and
after
that
i
really
know
with
whom
i
was
dancing
i
began
to
get
so
intoxicated
with
it
all
i
never
heard
musicians
play
better
or
get
more
of
the
spirit
of
dance
in
their
music
than
those
did
they
had
just
given
us
the
most
lovely
swinging
things
one
after
another
when
suddenly
they
all
stopped
and
the
leader
drew
his
bow
across
his
violin
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
ever
heard
anything
like
the
call
of
that
waltz
from
that
gipsy
strings
it
laughed
you
a
signal
and
you
felt
yourself
follow
the
first
strain
just
then
somebody
happened
to
take
me
from
whomever
i
was
with
and
i
caught
step
and
glided
off
the
universe
the
strongest
arms
that
i
had
felt
that
evening
or
ever
held
me
and
i
did
have
to
look
up
to
see
who
it
was
i
do
know
why
i
knew
but
i
did
i
was
clasped
so
very
close
to
him
or
left
to
float
by
myself
an
inch
i
was
just
a
part
of
him
like
the
arms
themselves
or
the
hand
that
mine
molded
into
and
while
that
teased
and
cajoled
and
mocked
and
rocked
and
sobbed
and
throbbed
i
laid
my
cheek
against
his
coat
sleeve
and
gave
myself
away
i
did
care
to
whom
again
that
strange
sense
of
some
wonderful
eternal
good
came
to
me
and
i
found
myself
humming
billy
little
soul
to
keep
prayer
against
the
doctor
sleeve
to
the
tune
of
that
magic
waltz
i
had
never
danced
with
him
before
of
course
but
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
doing
it
always
and
i
melted
in
his
arms
as
that
baby
had
wilted
to
his
mother
out
in
the
cabin
a
few
hours
earlier
and
i
do
see
how
such
happiness
as
that
stop
but
with
a
soft
entreating
wail
the
music
came
to
an
end
and
there
the
doctor
was
smiling
down
into
my
face
with
his
whimsical
friendly
smile
that
woke
me
up
all
over
somebody
has
stolen
a
rose
from
the
carter
garden
and
brought
it
to
the
dance
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
was
for
me
alone
no
i
flashed
back
a
and
with
that
i
danced
off
again
with
the
judge
while
the
doctor
disappeared
through
the
door
and
i
heard
the
chuck
of
his
car
as
it
whirled
away
he
had
just
stopped
in
for
a
second
to
see
the
fun
and
god
had
given
me
that
gipsy
waltz
with
him
because
he
knew
i
needed
something
like
that
in
my
life
to
keep
for
always
this
has
been
a
happy
night
in
which
i
betrothed
myself
to
alfred
though
he
does
know
it
yet
i
am
going
to
take
it
as
a
sign
that
life
for
us
is
going
to
be
brilliant
and
gay
and
full
of
laughter
and
love
i
have
had
billy
in
my
arms
and
i
do
know
how
i
shall
ever
get
myself
to
sleep
if
i
let
myself
think
about
it
his
on
my
breast
aches
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
the
great
big
god
understands
the
women
folk
that
he
makes
even
if
they
do
understand
themselves

razoo
most
parties
are
just
bunches
of
selfish
people
who
go
off
in
the
corners
and
have
good
times
all
by
themselves
but
in
hillsboro
tennessee
it
is
not
that
way
everybody
that
is
not
invited
helps
the
hostess
get
ready
and
have
nice
things
for
the
others
and
sometimes
i
think
they
really
have
the
best
time
of
all
this
morning
aunt
bettie
came
up
my
front
steps
before
breakfast
with
a
large
basketful
of
things
for
my
dinner
and
i
wondered
what
i
would
have
collected
to
be
served
to
those
people
by
the
time
all
my
neighbors
had
made
their
prize
contributions
it
took
aunt
bettie
and
judy
a
to
unpack
her
things
and
set
them
in
the
refrigerator
and
on
the
pantry
shelves
one
was
a
plump
that
had
been
keeping
company
in
a
tight
box
with
a
sponge
soaked
in
sherry
for
ever
since
new
year
it
was
ripe
or
smelled
so
it
made
me
gnaw
under
my
belt
a
little
later
judy
was
exclaiming
over
a
ham
that
had
been
simmered
in
port
and
larded
with
egg
dressing
when
johnson
came
in
and
began
to
unpack
her
basket
which
was
mostly
bottles
of
things
she
said
she
used
to
stick
food
the
barber
got
the
run
of
them
before
the
dinner
was
over
and
got
badly
stuck
so
judy
says
that
what
made
him
make
the
mistake
i
had
planned
to
have
a
lot
of
strange
food
and
had
ordered
some
things
up
from
a
caterer
in
the
city
but
i
telephoned
the
express
man
not
to
deliver
them
until
the
next
day
even
if
they
did
spoil
how
could
i
use
soft
shelled
crabs
when
wade
had
sent
me
word
that
she
was
going
to
bake
some
brook
trout
by
a
recipe
of
the
judge
grandmother
hampton
buford
had
let
me
know
about
two
fat
little
summer
turkeys
she
was
going
to
stuff
with
and
green
sage
and
seemed
foolish
eating
beside
them
but
when
the
little
bit
of
a
baby
pig
roasted
whole
with
an
apple
in
its
mouth
looking
too
frisky
and
innocent
for
worlds
with
his
little
baked
tail
curled
up
in
the
air
arrived
from
caruthers
cain
i
went
out
into
the
garden
and
laughed
at
the
idea
of
having
spent
money
for
lobsters
to
be
shipped
alive
and
to
be
served
broiled
in
their
own
shells
when
i
got
back
in
the
kitchen
things
were
well
under
way
everything
smelling
grand
and
aunt
bettie
in
full
swing
matching
up
my
dinner
guests
nobody
in
this
town
could
suit
me
better
than
pet
buford
for
a
and
i
believe
i
have
all
the
east
rooms
done
over
in
blue
chintz
for
her
i
think
that
would
be
the
best
thing
to
set
off
her
blue
eyes
and
corn
silk
hair
she
was
saying
as
she
cut
orange
peel
into
strips
you
planned
the
refurnishing
of
that
east
wing
to
suit
the
style
of
nearly
every
girl
in
hillsboro
since
tom
put
on
long
trousers
bettie
pollard
and
they
are
just
as
they
have
been
for
fifteen
years
since
you
did
over
the
whole
house
said
johnson
as
she
poured
a
half
full
from
one
bottle
and
added
a
tablespoonful
from
another
well
i
think
he
is
really
interested
now
from
the
way
he
danced
most
of
his
time
with
her
down
at
the
hotel
the
other
night
and
i
have
hopes
i
never
had
before
now
molly
do
put
him
between
you
and
her
sort
of
cornered
so
he
ca
even
ruth
chester
she
is
too
old
for
him
and
tom
mother
looked
at
me
over
the
orange
peel
as
to
a
confederate
humph
i
like
to
see
you
or
molly
or
any
woman
tom
pollard
said
johnson
with
a
wry
smile
as
she
tasted
the
concoction
in
the
i
have
to
put
him
at
the
end
of
the
table
because
he
is
my
kinsman
and
the
only
host
i
got
at
present
aunt
bettie
i
said
regretfully
i
always
take
every
chance
to
rub
in
tom
and
my
relationship
on
aunt
bettie
so
she
wo
notice
our
flirtation
i
put
john
moore
at
the
head
of
the
table
if
i
were
you
molly
carter
because
he
about
the
only
man
you
invited
that
has
got
any
sense
left
since
you
and
that
chester
girl
took
to
visiting
hillsboro
he
a
host
of
steadiness
in
himself
and
the
way
he
ignores
all
you
women
who
would
run
after
him
if
he
would
let
you
shows
what
he
is
he
has
my
full
confidence
and
as
she
delivered
herself
of
this
judgment
of
doctor
john
johnson
drove
in
all
the
corks
tight
and
began
to
pound
spice
he
not
out
of
the
yet
caroline
said
aunt
bettie
with
her
most
speculative
smile
i
have
about
decided
on
him
for
ruth
since
the
judge
has
taken
to
following
molly
about
as
bad
as
billy
moore
does
but
do
you
all
say
a
word
for
john
mighty
timid
and
i
believe
in
spite
of
all
these
years
he
had
a
single
notion
yet
if
he
had
had
he
have
tried
a
with
you
molly
like
all
the
rest
of
the
shy
birds
in
town
he
does
see
a
woman
as
anything
but
a
patient
at
the
end
of
a
spoon
and
mighty
kind
and
gentle
he
does
the
dosing
of
them
too
just
the
other
day
dearie
me
judy
what
has
boiled
over
now
and
in
the
excitement
that
ensued
i
escaped
to
the
garden
yes
aunt
bettie
is
right
about
doctor
john
he
does
see
a
woman
and
there
is
no
way
to
make
him
what
she
had
said
about
it
made
me
realize
that
he
had
always
been
like
that
and
i
told
myself
that
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
my
heart
should
beat
in
my
slippers
on
that
account
still
i
do
see
why
ruth
chester
should
have
her
head
literally
thrown
against
that
stone
wall
and
i
wish
aunt
bettie
would
it
seemed
like
a
desecration
even
to
try
to
him
and
it
made
me
hot
with
indignation
all
over
i
dug
so
fiercely
at
the
roots
of
my
phlox
with
a
trowel
i
had
picked
up
that
they
groaned
so
loud
i
could
almost
hear
them
i
felt
as
if
i
must
operate
on
something
and
it
was
in
this
mood
that
alfred
letter
found
me
it
had
a
surprise
in
it
and
i
sat
back
on
the
grass
and
read
it
with
my
heart
beating
like
a
he
had
sailed
the
day
he
had
posted
it
and
he
was
due
to
arrive
in
new
york
almost
as
soon
as
it
did
just
any
hour
now
i
calculated
in
a
flash
and
from
new
york
immediately
to
hillsboro
he
had
written
in
words
that
fairly
sung
themselves
off
the
paper
i
was
frightened
so
frightened
that
the
letter
shook
in
my
hands
and
with
only
the
thought
of
being
sure
that
i
might
be
alone
for
a
few
minutes
with
it
i
fled
to
the
garret
surely
no
woman
ever
in
all
the
world
read
such
a
letter
as
that
and
no
wonder
my
breath
almost
failed
me
it
was
a
in
which
the
cold
paper
was
transubstantiated
into
a
heart
that
beat
against
mine
and
i
bowed
my
head
over
it
as
i
wet
it
with
tears
i
knew
then
that
i
had
taken
his
coming
back
lightly
had
fussed
over
it
and
been
of
it
while
not
caring
at
all
all
that
awful
melting
away
of
my
fatness
seemed
just
a
lack
of
confidence
in
his
love
for
me
he
would
have
minded
if
i
weighed
five
hundred
i
felt
sure
he
loved
me
really
really
really
and
i
had
sat
and
weighed
him
with
a
lot
of
men
who
were
nothing
more
than
amused
by
my
flightiness
or
taken
with
my
beauty
and
who
would
have
known
such
love
if
it
were
shown
to
them
through
a
telescope
illustration
his
letters
were
all
there
and
his
photographs
i
reached
into
a
trunk
that
stood
right
beside
me
and
took
out
a
box
that
i
had
looked
into
for
years
his
letters
were
all
there
and
his
photographs
that
were
as
handsome
as
the
young
god
of
love
himself
i
could
hardly
see
them
through
my
tears
but
i
knew
that
they
were
dim
in
places
with
being
cried
over
when
i
had
put
them
away
years
ago
after
aunt
adeline
decided
that
i
was
to
be
married
i
kissed
the
poor
and
with
that
a
perfect
flood
of
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
but
they
did
fall
for
there
right
in
front
of
me
stood
a
more
human
being
than
i
could
possibly
be
if
i
judged
by
appearances
molly
molly
gulped
billy
i
am
so
sick
i
going
to
die
here
on
the
floor
and
he
sank
into
my
arms
oh
billy
what
is
the
matter
i
gasped
and
gave
him
a
little
terrified
shake
mamie
johnson
did
it
poked
her
finger
down
her
throat
and
mine
too
he
wailed
against
my
breast
we
was
full
of
things
folks
gived
us
to
eat
and
could
eat
no
more
she
said
if
we
did
that
with
our
fingers
it
would
all
come
up
and
we
would
have
room
for
some
more
then
she
did
it
and
i
going
to
die
dead
dead
no
no
lover
you
be
all
right
in
a
second
stay
quiet
here
in
your
molly
lap
and
you
will
be
well
in
just
a
few
minutes
i
said
with
a
smile
i
hid
in
his
yellow
mop
as
i
kissed
the
where
mamie
i
thought
to
ask
with
the
greatest
apprehension
in
the
garden
eating
judy
baked
hot
for
both
of
us
she
frow
up
as
much
as
i
did
or
maybe
more
he
answered
snuggling
close
and
much
comforted
do
ever
ever
do
that
again
billy
i
said
giving
him
both
a
hug
and
a
shake
it
piggy
to
eat
more
than
you
can
hold
and
then
still
want
more
what
would
your
father
say
doc
ai
no
good
and
i
do
care
what
he
says
answered
billy
with
spirit
he
do
play
no
more
and
he
do
laugh
no
more
and
he
eat
no
more
hardly
too
i
ai
to
live
in
that
house
with
him
two
days
longer
i
want
to
come
over
and
sleep
in
your
bed
with
blue
ribbons
on
the
posts
and
have
you
to
play
with
me
molly
do
say
that
lover
ever
again
i
said
as
i
bent
over
him
your
father
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
you
must
never
never
leave
him
i
bet
i
will
when
i
get
big
enough
to
kill
a
bear
answered
billy
decidedly
say
do
you
reckon
mamie
saved
even
a
little
piece
of
that
cake
i
i
had
better
go
see
and
he
slipped
out
of
my
arms
and
was
gone
before
i
could
hold
him
it
a
lonely
house
across
the
garden
with
the
big
and
the
tiny
man
in
it
all
by
themselves
and
tears
from
another
corner
of
my
heart
entirely
rose
to
my
eyes
at
the
thought
but
they
too
never
fell
for
i
heard
johnson
calling
and
i
had
to
run
down
quick
and
see
what
new
delicacy
had
arrived
for
my
party
uncle
thomas
pollard
had
sent
me
a
quart
bottle
of
his
private
stock
with
the
message
to
put
the
mint
to
soak
just
one
hour
and
twenty
minutes
before
the
men
came
i
made
room
for
it
beside
the
case
of
champagne
on
the
cellar
shelf
and
wondered
how
they
would
stand
it
all
we
do
have
champagne
often
in
hillsboro
and
when
we
do
nobody
seems
to
want
to
cut
down
on
the
juleps
consequently
well
nothing
ever
really
happens
however
it
must
have
been
the
champagne
that
made
tom
act
as
he
did
he
was
never
like
that
before
somehow
i
did
enjoy
dressing
for
my
dinner
as
i
did
for
the
dance
and
when
i
was
through
i
stood
before
the
mirror
and
looked
at
myself
a
long
time
i
was
very
tall
and
slim
and
well
i
suppose
i
might
say
regal
in
that
amethyst
crêpe
with
the
soft
but
i
looked
to
myself
about
the
eyes
as
i
had
been
doing
for
years
when
i
put
on
my
sunday
clothes
to
go
to
church
with
carter
he
was
always
in
a
hurry
and
i
did
care
about
looking
at
myself
in
the
mirror
anyway
nobody
else
ever
looked
at
me
and
what
was
the
use
and
that
rene
triumph
made
me
feel
no
different
from
one
of
miss
hettie
conceptions
that
i
had
been
wearing
for
ages
with
indifference
and
total
lack
of
style
i
shrugged
my
shoulder
almost
out
of
the
dress
with
what
i
thought
was
sadness
though
it
felt
a
trifle
like
temper
too
and
went
on
down
into
the
garden
to
see
if
any
of
my
flowers
had
a
message
for
me
but
it
was
a
bored
garden
i
stepped
into
just
as
the
last
purple
flush
of
day
was
being
drunk
down
by
the
night
the
tall
white
lilies
laid
their
heads
over
on
my
breast
and
went
to
sleep
before
i
had
said
a
word
to
them
and
the
nasturtiums
snarled
around
my
feet
until
they
got
my
slippers
stained
with
green
only
billy
stood
up
stiff
and
sturdy
slightly
flushed
with
imbibing
the
night
dew
and
tipped
me
an
impertinent
wink
i
felt
cheered
at
the
sight
of
them
and
bent
down
to
gather
a
bunch
of
them
to
wear
even
if
they
did
swear
at
my
amethyst
draperies
when
an
amused
smile
that
was
done
out
loud
came
from
the
path
just
behind
me
do
gather
them
all
peaches
said
doctor
john
teasingly
as
he
stooped
beside
me
leave
a
few
for
for
the
others
i
waked
up
in
a
and
so
did
all
those
prying
flowers
i
felt
sure
i
was
just
gathering
them
for
place
bouquets
for
for
the
girls
i
said
stupidly
as
i
moved
over
a
little
nearer
to
him
why
it
is
that
the
minute
that
man
comes
near
me
i
get
warm
and
comfortable
and
stupid
and
as
young
as
billy
and
bubbly
and
sad
and
happy
and
cross
is
more
than
i
can
say
but
i
do
i
never
possibly
know
how
to
answer
any
remark
that
he
may
happen
to
make
unless
it
is
something
that
makes
me
lose
my
temper
his
next
remark
was
the
usual
spark
better
give
them
the
run
of
the
garden
alone
molly
no
show
for
unless
you
do
he
said
laughingly
or
the
buttons
either
he
added
under
his
breath
so
i
could
just
hear
it
i
wish
johnson
could
have
heard
how
soft
his
voice
lingered
over
that
little
she
is
so
experienced
she
could
have
told
me
if
it
meant
but
of
course
he
is
like
other
men
there
are
lots
of
questions
i
going
to
ask
alfred
after
i
married
to
him
carter
did
know
anything
about
anything
and
i
never
cared
to
ask
him
but
i
wonder
how
you
know
when
oh
you
molly
came
a
hail
in
tom
voice
from
the
gate
just
as
i
was
making
up
my
mind
to
try
and
think
up
something
to
wither
the
doctor
with
and
he
and
ruth
chester
came
up
the
front
walk
to
meet
us
i
wondered
why
i
was
having
a
party
in
my
house
when
being
alone
in
my
garden
with
just
a
neighbor
was
so
much
more
fun
but
i
had
to
begin
to
enjoy
myself
right
off
for
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
rest
came
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
my
house
look
so
lovely
before
johnson
had
put
all
the
flowers
out
of
hers
and
cain
garden
all
over
everything
and
the
table
was
a
mass
of
soft
pink
roses
that
were
shedding
perfume
and
nodding
at
one
another
in
their
most
society
manner
there
is
no
glimmer
in
the
world
like
that
which
comes
from
really
old
polished
silver
and
rosewood
and
mahogany
and
linen
feels
like
oriental
silk
across
one
knees
suddenly
i
felt
very
stately
and
and
responsible
as
i
looked
at
them
all
across
the
roses
and
sparkling
glasses
they
were
lovely
women
all
of
them
and
could
such
men
be
found
anywhere
else
in
the
world
when
i
left
them
all
to
go
out
into
the
big
universe
to
meet
the
distinctions
that
i
knew
my
husband
would
have
for
me
would
i
sit
at
salt
with
people
who
loved
me
like
this
i
saw
pet
buford
say
something
to
tom
about
me
that
i
know
was
lovely
from
the
way
he
smiled
at
me
and
the
judge
eyes
were
a
full
cup
for
any
woman
to
have
offered
her
then
in
a
flash
all
the
seemed
to
go
to
my
head
tom
mixing
of
that
julep
had
been
skilful
too
and
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
and
there
i
might
have
been
crying
at
my
own
party
if
i
had
felt
a
strong
warm
hand
laid
on
mine
as
it
rested
on
my
lap
and
doctor
john
kind
voice
teased
into
my
ears
steady
peaches
there
the
to
come
yet
he
whispered
i
hated
him
but
held
on
to
his
thumb
tight
for
half
a
minute
he
did
know
what
the
matter
really
was
but
he
understood
what
i
needed
he
always
does
and
after
that
everybody
had
a
good
time
the
ginger
barber
and
judy
as
much
as
anybody
and
i
could
see
aunt
bettie
and
johnson
peeping
in
the
pantry
door
having
the
time
of
their
lives
too
that
dinner
was
going
like
an
airship
on
a
high
wind
when
something
happened
to
tangle
its
tail
feathers
and
i
can
hardly
write
it
for
trembling
yet
it
was
a
simple
little
blue
telegram
but
it
might
have
been
on
a
tear
for
the
way
it
acted
it
was
for
me
but
the
ginger
barber
handed
it
to
tom
and
he
opened
it
and
looking
at
me
over
his
full
after
many
times
emptied
glass
he
solemnly
read
it
out
loud
it
said
landed
this
noon
have
i
your
permission
to
come
to
hillsboro
immediately
answer
alfred
it
was
dreadful
nobody
said
a
word
and
tom
laid
the
telegram
right
down
in
his
plate
where
it
immediately
began
to
soak
up
the
dressing
of
his
salad
he
was
so
white
and
shaky
that
pet
looked
at
him
in
amazement
and
then
i
am
sure
she
had
the
good
sense
to
find
his
hand
under
the
cloth
and
hold
it
for
his
shoulder
hovered
against
hers
and
the
color
came
back
to
his
face
as
he
smiled
down
at
her
i
do
believe
ever
get
the
courage
to
look
at
tom
again
until
he
marries
pet
which
he
do
now
i
feel
sure
and
as
for
the
judge
and
ruth
chester
i
was
glad
they
were
sitting
beside
each
other
for
i
could
avoid
that
side
of
the
table
with
my
eyes
until
i
had
steadied
myself
a
few
seconds
at
least
the
surprise
made
the
others
i
had
been
dining
seem
statues
from
the
stone
age
and
only
graves
fork
failed
to
hang
fire
his
appetite
is
as
strong
as
his
nerves
and
delia
hawes
looked
at
his
composure
with
the
relief
plain
in
her
eyes
henrietta
smile
in
the
judge
direction
was
doubtful
but
they
were
not
all
my
lovers
and
why
that
awful
silence
i
could
say
a
word
and
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
if
it
had
been
for
the
doctor
he
leaned
forward
and
his
deep
eyes
came
out
in
their
wonderful
way
and
seemed
to
collect
every
pair
of
eyes
at
the
table
even
the
most
astounded
as
he
raised
his
glass
we
all
held
our
breaths
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
no
wonder
we
are
all
stricken
dumb
at
carter
telegram
he
said
in
his
deep
voice
that
commands
everybody
and
everything
even
the
terrors
of
birth
and
death
the
whole
town
will
be
paralyzed
at
the
news
that
its
most
distinguished
citizen
is
only
going
to
give
them
two
days
to
get
ready
to
receive
him
i
can
see
the
panic
the
brass
band
will
have
now
getting
the
brass
shined
up
and
i
want
to
be
the
one
to
tell
mayor
pollard
myself
so
as
to
suggest
to
him
to
have
at
least
a
speech
of
welcome
to
hand
out
at
the
train
we
make
it
one
time
for
him
when
he
lands
in
the
old
town
and
here
to
him
god
bless
him
every
glass
high
they
all
drank
and
i
suppose
it
helped
them
i
wish
i
could
have
drained
a
quart
but
i
could
swallow
a
sip
though
i
did
a
good
stunt
of
pretending
illustration
every
glass
high
the
rest
of
this
evening
has
paid
me
off
for
every
sin
i
have
ever
committed
or
am
ever
going
to
commit
tom
took
pet
home
early
and
i
hope
they
walked
in
the
moonlight
for
hours
tom
is
the
kind
of
man
that
any
pretty
girl
who
is
loving
enough
in
the
moonlight
could
comfort
for
anything
i
not
at
all
worried
about
him
but
the
hour
i
sat
on
my
front
steps
and
talked
to
judge
wade
must
have
brought
gray
hairs
to
my
head
if
it
was
daylight
and
i
could
see
them
ruth
chester
had
said
with
the
loveliest
haunted
look
in
her
great
dark
eyes
and
i
had
felt
as
if
i
had
killed
something
that
was
alive
and
that
i
had
killed
it
enough
doctor
john
had
been
called
from
his
coffee
to
a
patient
and
had
gone
with
just
a
friendly
word
of
good
night
and
the
others
had
at
last
left
the
judge
and
me
alone
also
in
the
moonlight
which
i
wished
in
my
heart
somebody
would
put
out
they
say
among
the
lawyers
that
it
is
a
good
thing
that
benton
wade
is
on
the
bench
for
it
is
no
use
to
try
a
case
against
him
when
he
has
the
handling
of
a
jury
he
just
looks
them
in
the
face
and
tells
them
how
to
vote
he
looked
me
in
the
face
and
told
me
how
to
marry
and
i
not
sure
yet
that
i
wo
do
as
he
says
of
course
i
in
love
with
alfred
but
if
he
wants
me
he
had
better
get
me
away
quick
before
the
judge
makes
all
his
arrangements
a
woman
loves
to
be
courted
with
poems
and
flowers
and
deference
but
she
mighty
apt
to
marry
the
man
who
says
do
argue
but
put
on
your
bonnet
and
come
with
me
the
fact
that
it
was
too
late
to
get
into
the
clerk
office
saved
me
but
in
two
days
oh
i
crying
crying
in
my
heart
which
is
worse
than
in
my
eyes
as
i
sit
and
look
across
my
garden
where
the
cold
moon
is
hanging
low
over
the
tall
trees
behind
the
doctor
house
and
his
light
in
his
room
is
burning
warm
and
bright
they
are
right
does
care
if
i
am
going
away
for
ever
with
alfred
his
quick
toast
to
him
and
the
lovely
warm
look
he
poured
over
poor
frightened
me
at
his
side
as
he
drank
his
champagne
told
me
that
once
and
for
all
still
we
have
been
so
close
together
over
his
baby
and
i
have
grown
so
dependent
on
him
for
so
many
things
that
it
cuts
into
me
like
a
hot
knife
that
he
should
care
if
he
lost
me
even
for
a
neighbor
i
should
mind
not
having
husband
if
i
could
always
live
close
by
him
and
billy
like
this
and
if
i
married
judge
wade
i
could
at
least
have
him
for
a
family
physician
i
do
like
of
course
i
going
with
alfred
now
that
an
accident
has
made
me
announce
the
fact
to
the
whole
town
before
he
even
knows
it
himself
but
wherever
i
go
that
light
in
the
room
with
that
lonely
man
is
going
to
burn
in
my
heart
hope
it
will
throw
a
glow
over
alfred
leaf
seventh
dashed
i
do
believe
god
gave
that
wise
angel
charge
concerning
me
lest
i
get
dashed
but
i
just
got
dashed
anyway
and
its
my
own
fault
not
the
angel
i
have
suffered
this
day
until
i
want
to
lay
my
face
down
against
the
hem
of
his
garment
and
wait
in
the
dust
for
him
to
pick
me
up
i
shall
never
be
able
to
do
it
myself
and
how
he
going
to
do
it
i
ca
see
but
he
will
that
last
night
was
bad
enough
but
been
worse
i
did
sleep
until
long
after
daylight
and
then
judy
came
in
before
eight
with
a
letter
for
me
that
looked
like
a
state
document
i
felt
in
my
trembly
bones
that
it
was
some
sort
of
summons
affair
from
judge
wade
and
it
was
i
looked
into
the
first
paragraph
and
then
decided
that
i
had
better
get
up
and
dress
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
single
egg
before
i
tried
to
read
it
incidental
to
my
bath
and
dressing
i
weighed
and
found
that
i
had
lost
all
four
of
those
last
surplus
pounds
and
two
more
in
three
days
those
two
extra
pounds
might
be
construed
to
prove
love
but
exactly
on
whom
i
was
utterly
unprepared
to
say
i
did
even
enjoy
the
thinness
but
took
a
kind
of
look
in
my
glass
and
tried
to
slip
the
egg
past
my
bored
lips
and
get
myself
to
chew
it
down
it
was
work
and
then
i
took
up
the
judge
letter
which
also
was
work
and
more
of
it
he
started
in
at
the
beginning
of
everything
that
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
tuberculosis
girl
and
i
cried
over
the
pages
of
her
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
sister
at
the
tenth
page
we
buried
her
and
took
up
alfred
and
i
must
say
i
saw
a
new
alfred
in
the
judge
appreciation
of
him
but
i
did
want
him
as
bad
as
i
had
the
day
before
when
i
read
his
own
new
and
old
letters
and
cried
over
his
old
photographs
i
suppose
that
was
the
result
of
some
of
what
the
judge
manages
the
juries
with
he
be
apt
to
use
it
on
a
woman
and
she
would
find
out
about
it
until
it
was
too
late
to
be
anything
but
mad
still
when
he
began
on
me
at
page
sixteen
i
felt
a
little
better
though
i
did
know
myself
any
better
than
i
did
alfred
when
i
got
to
page
twenty
what
i
am
is
just
a
poor
foolish
woman
who
has
a
lot
more
heart
than
she
can
manage
with
the
amount
of
brains
she
got
with
it
at
birth
not
any
star
in
a
sky
and
i
do
want
to
inspire
anybody
it
too
much
of
a
job
i
want
to
be
a
healthy
happy
woman
and
a
wife
to
a
man
who
can
inspire
himself
and
manage
me
i
want
to
marry
a
thin
man
and
have
from
five
to
ten
thin
children
and
when
i
get
to
be
thirty
i
want
my
husband
to
want
me
to
be
as
fat
as
aunt
bettie
but
not
let
me
an
inspiration
could
be
fat
and
i
always
in
danger
from
hot
muffins
and
chicken
gravy
however
if
i
should
undertake
to
be
all
the
things
judge
wade
said
in
that
letter
he
wanted
me
to
be
to
him
i
should
soon
be
skin
and
bones
from
mental
and
physical
exercise
still
he
does
live
in
hillsboro
and
i
wo
let
myself
know
how
my
heart
aches
at
the
thought
of
leaving
my
home
and
other
things
it
up
in
my
throat
and
i
seem
always
to
be
swallowing
it
the
last
few
days
all
the
men
who
write
me
letters
seem
to
get
themselves
wound
up
into
a
skyrocket
and
then
let
themselves
explode
in
the
last
paragraph
and
it
always
upsets
my
nerves
i
was
just
about
to
begin
to
cry
again
over
the
last
words
of
the
judge
when
the
only
bright
spot
in
the
day
so
far
suddenly
happened
pet
buford
blew
in
with
the
pinkest
cheeks
and
the
brightest
eyes
i
had
seen
since
i
looked
in
the
mirror
the
night
of
the
dance
she
was
in
an
awful
hurry
molly
dear
she
said
with
her
words
literally
falling
over
themselves
tom
says
you
give
us
some
of
your
dinner
to
take
for
lunch
in
the
hup
for
we
are
going
way
out
to
wayne
county
to
see
some
awfully
fine
tobacco
he
has
heard
is
there
i
do
want
to
ask
mother
for
she
wo
let
me
go
and
his
mother
if
he
asked
her
will
begin
to
talk
about
us
tom
said
come
to
you
and
you
would
understand
and
fix
it
quick
he
said
kiss
you
for
him
and
tell
you
he
said
on
in
the
water
fine
is
he
a
joke
and
we
kissed
and
laughed
and
packed
a
basket
and
kissed
and
laughed
again
for
i
felt
amused
and
happy
for
a
few
minutes
and
also
deserted
it
a
very
good
thing
for
a
woman
conceit
to
find
out
how
many
of
her
lovers
are
just
i
may
have
needed
tom
deflection
anyway
i
do
know
when
i
ever
was
so
glad
to
see
anybody
as
i
was
when
johnson
came
in
the
front
door
a
woman
who
has
proved
to
her
own
satisfaction
that
marriage
is
a
failure
is
at
times
a
great
tonic
to
other
women
i
needed
a
tonic
badly
this
morning
and
i
got
it
well
from
all
my
long
experience
molly
she
said
as
she
seated
herself
and
began
to
hem
a
with
long
steady
stabs
husbands
are
just
stick
candy
in
different
jars
they
may
look
a
little
different
but
they
all
taste
alike
and
you
soon
get
tired
of
them
in
two
months
you
wo
know
the
difference
in
being
married
to
al
bennett
and
carter
and
you
have
to
go
on
living
with
him
maybe
fifty
years
luck
does
strike
twice
in
the
same
place
and
you
ca
count
on
losing
two
husbands
al
father
was
johnson
first
cousin
and
had
more
crochets
and
worse
he
had
silent
spells
that
lasted
a
week
and
family
prayers
three
times
a
day
though
he
got
drunk
twice
a
year
for
a
month
at
a
time
al
looks
very
much
like
him
johnson
i
said
after
a
minute
silence
while
i
had
decided
whether
or
not
i
had
better
tell
her
all
about
it
if
a
woman
in
love
with
her
husband
you
ca
trust
her
to
keep
a
secret
but
i
decided
to
try
johnson
i
really
am
not
engaged
exactly
to
alfred
bennett
though
i
suppose
he
thinks
so
by
now
if
he
has
got
the
answer
to
that
telegram
but
but
something
has
made
me
made
me
think
about
judge
wade
that
is
he
what
do
you
think
of
him
mrs
johnson
i
concluded
in
the
most
pitifully
perplexed
tone
of
voice
all
alike
molly
all
as
much
alike
as
peas
in
a
pod
all
except
john
moore
who
the
only
exception
in
all
the
male
tribe
i
ever
met
his
marrying
once
was
just
accidental
and
must
be
forgiven
him
she
fell
in
love
with
him
while
he
was
treating
her
for
typhoid
when
his
back
was
turned
as
it
were
and
it
was
god
own
kindness
in
him
that
made
him
marry
her
when
he
found
out
how
it
was
with
the
poor
thing
there
not
a
woman
in
this
town
who
could
marry
that
would
marry
him
at
the
drop
of
his
hat
but
thank
goodness
that
hat
will
never
drop
and
have
one
sensible
man
to
comfort
and
doctor
me
down
into
my
old
age
now
just
look
at
that
johnson
come
home
here
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
and
i
have
to
get
that
old
paper
i
hunted
out
of
his
desk
for
him
last
night
i
wonder
how
he
came
to
forget
it
it
funny
how
johnson
always
knows
what
johnson
wants
before
he
knows
himself
and
gets
it
before
he
asks
for
it
as
she
went
out
the
gate
the
postman
came
in
and
at
the
sight
of
another
letter
my
heart
again
slunk
off
into
my
slippers
and
my
brain
seemed
about
to
back
up
in
a
corner
and
refuse
to
work
in
a
flash
it
came
to
me
that
men
ought
to
write
letters
to
women
very
much
they
really
do
plow
deep
enough
they
just
irritate
the
top
soil
i
took
this
missive
from
alfred
counted
all
the
fifteen
pages
put
it
out
of
sight
under
a
book
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
the
ginger
barber
coming
dejectedly
around
to
the
side
gate
from
the
kitchen
i
knew
the
scene
he
had
had
with
judy
about
the
bottle
encounters
of
the
night
before
saw
johnson
shooed
off
down
the
street
by
johnson
saw
the
car
go
chucking
hurriedly
in
the
garage
and
then
my
spirit
turned
itself
to
the
wall
and
refused
to
be
comforted
i
tried
my
best
but
failed
to
respond
to
my
own
remonstrances
with
myself
and
tears
were
slowly
gathering
in
a
cloud
of
gloom
when
a
blue
gingham
sunbeam
burst
into
the
room
git
your
and
your
toothbresh
quick
molly
if
you
want
to
pack
in
my
trunk
he
exclaimed
with
his
eyes
dancing
and
a
curl
standing
straight
up
on
the
top
of
his
head
as
it
has
a
habit
of
doing
when
he
is
most
excited
you
ca
take
nothing
but
them
going
to
put
in
a
rope
to
tie
the
whale
with
when
i
ketch
him
and
it
take
up
all
the
rest
of
the
room
git
quick
yes
lover
i
get
them
for
you
but
tell
molly
where
it
is
you
are
going
to
sail
off
with
her
in
that
trunk
of
yours
i
asked
dropping
into
the
game
as
i
have
always
done
with
him
no
matter
what
game
of
my
own
pressed
when
he
called
on
the
ocean
where
the
boats
go
and
run
right
over
a
whale
do
you
remember
you
showed
me
them
pictures
of
spout
whales
in
a
book
molly
doc
says
they
comes
right
up
by
the
ship
and
you
can
hear
shoot
water
and
maybe
a
iceberg
too
which
do
you
want
to
ketch
most
molly
a
iceberg
or
a
whale
his
eager
eyes
demanded
instant
decision
on
my
part
of
the
nature
of
capture
i
preferred
my
mind
quickly
reverted
to
those
two
ponderous
and
intense
epistles
i
had
got
within
the
hour
and
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
laughed
until
i
felt
almost
merry
the
iceberg
billy
every
time
i
said
at
last
i
just
ca
manage
whales
especially
if
they
are
ardent
which
word
means
hot
i
like
or
i
think
i
should
if
i
could
catch
one
i
do
believe
you
could
molly
but
maybe
doc
will
let
you
put
a
rope
and
a
long
hook
in
his
trunk
to
try
with
if
your
clothes
go
into
mine
his
is
a
heap
the
biggest
anyway
and
nurse
tilly
said
he
oughter
put
my
things
in
his
but
i
cried
and
then
he
went
and
got
out
that
little
one
for
me
come
see
what
do
you
mean
billy
i
asked
while
a
sudden
fear
shot
all
over
me
like
lightning
you
just
playing
are
you
no
i
ai
playing
molly
he
exclaimed
excitedly
me
and
you
and
doc
is
across
the
ocean
for
a
long
long
time
away
from
here
doc
ast
me
about
it
this
morning
and
i
told
him
all
right
and
you
could
come
with
us
if
you
was
good
he
said
could
i
go
without
you
if
you
was
busy
and
could
come
and
i
told
him
you
would
put
things
down
and
come
if
i
said
so
wo
you
molly
it
wo
be
no
fun
without
you
and
you
cry
all
by
yourself
with
me
gone
his
little
face
was
all
drawn
up
with
anxiety
and
sympathy
at
my
lonely
estate
with
him
out
of
it
and
a
cry
rose
up
from
my
heart
with
a
kind
of
primitive
savagery
at
what
i
felt
was
coming
down
upon
me
without
waiting
to
take
him
with
me
or
think
or
do
anything
but
feel
deadly
savage
anger
i
hurried
across
the
garden
and
into
doctor
office
where
he
was
just
laying
off
his
gloves
and
dust
coat
what
do
you
mean
john
moore
by
daring
daring
to
think
you
can
go
and
take
billy
away
from
me
i
demanded
looking
at
him
with
what
must
have
been
such
fear
and
madness
in
my
face
that
he
was
startled
as
he
came
close
to
the
table
against
which
i
leaned
his
face
had
grown
white
and
quiet
at
my
attack
and
he
waited
to
answer
for
a
long
horrible
minute
that
pulled
me
apart
like
one
of
those
inquisition
machines
they
used
to
torture
women
with
when
they
did
know
any
better
modern
way
to
do
it
i
did
know
bill
would
tell
you
so
soon
molly
he
said
at
last
gently
looking
past
me
out
of
the
window
into
the
garden
i
was
coming
over
just
as
soon
as
i
got
back
from
this
call
to
talk
with
you
about
it
even
if
it
did
seem
to
intrude
bill
and
my
affairs
into
a
day
that
that
ought
to
be
all
yours
to
be
be
happy
in
but
bill
you
see
is
no
respecter
of
of
other
people
happy
days
if
he
wants
them
in
his
billy
happy
days
are
mine
and
mine
are
his
and
he
has
the
heart
not
to
leave
me
out
even
if
you
would
have
him
i
exclaimed
a
sob
gathering
in
my
heart
at
the
thought
that
my
little
lover
had
even
taken
in
a
situation
that
would
separate
him
from
me
across
an
ocean
bill
is
too
young
to
understand
when
he
is
is
being
bereaved
molly
he
said
and
still
he
did
look
at
me
i
have
been
appointed
a
delegate
to
represent
the
state
medical
association
at
the
centennial
congress
in
london
the
middle
of
next
month
and
somehow
i
feel
a
bit
pulled
lately
and
i
thought
i
would
take
the
little
chap
and
have
have
a
you
wo
need
him
now
peaches
and
i
could
go
without
him
could
i
the
sadness
in
his
voice
would
have
killed
me
if
i
had
let
it
madden
me
instead
wo
need
billy
any
more
i
exclaimed
with
a
rage
that
made
my
voice
literally
scorch
past
my
lips
was
there
ever
a
minute
in
his
life
that
i
have
needed
billy
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
to
me
you
are
cruel
cruel
and
i
have
always
known
it
cold
and
cruel
like
all
other
men
who
do
care
how
they
wring
the
life
blood
out
of
women
hearts
and
are
willing
to
use
their
children
to
do
it
with
even
the
law
does
help
us
poor
helpless
creatures
and
you
can
take
our
children
and
go
with
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
leave
us
suffering
i
have
gone
on
and
believed
that
you
were
not
like
what
the
women
say
all
men
are
and
that
you
cared
whether
you
hurt
people
or
not
but
now
i
see
that
you
are
just
the
same
and
you
take
my
baby
away
if
you
want
to
and
i
can
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
nothing
in
the
wide
world
i
am
completely
and
absolutely
helpless
you
coward
you
when
that
awful
word
the
worst
word
that
a
woman
can
use
to
a
man
left
my
lips
a
flame
shot
up
into
his
eyes
that
i
thought
would
burn
me
up
but
in
a
it
was
extinguished
by
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
for
the
situation
a
perfect
flood
of
mirth
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
shook
all
over
with
his
head
in
his
hands
until
i
saw
tears
creep
through
his
fingers
i
had
calmed
down
so
suddenly
that
i
was
about
to
begin
to
cry
in
good
earnest
when
he
wiped
his
eyes
and
said
with
a
low
laugh
in
his
throat
the
case
is
yours
molly
settled
out
of
court
and
the
clause
works
in
some
cases
for
a
woman
against
a
man
generally
speaking
anyway
the
pup
belongs
to
the
man
who
can
whistle
him
down
and
you
can
whistle
bill
from
me
any
day
i
just
his
father
and
what
i
think
or
want
does
matter
you
had
better
take
him
and
keep
him
i
intend
to
i
answered
haughtily
uncertain
as
to
whether
i
had
better
give
in
and
be
agreeable
or
stay
prepared
to
cry
in
case
there
was
further
argument
but
suddenly
a
strange
diffidence
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
looked
away
from
me
as
he
said
in
queer
hesitating
words
you
see
molly
i
thought
from
now
on
your
life
would
have
exactly
a
place
for
bill
have
you
considered
that
you
have
trained
him
to
demand
you
all
the
time
and
all
of
you
how
would
you
manage
bill
and
and
other
claims
and
if
there
is
a
contagious
thing
in
this
world
it
is
embarrassment
i
never
felt
anything
worse
in
all
my
life
than
the
shame
that
swept
over
me
in
a
great
hot
wave
when
that
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
made
me
realize
just
exactly
what
i
had
been
saying
to
him
about
what
and
how
i
had
said
it
i
stood
perfectly
still
shook
all
over
like
a
leaf
and
wondered
if
i
would
ever
be
able
to
raise
my
eyes
from
the
ground
a
dizzy
nauseated
feeling
for
myself
rose
up
in
me
against
myself
and
i
was
just
about
to
turn
on
my
heels
and
leave
him
i
hoped
for
ever
when
he
came
over
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
molly
he
said
in
a
voice
that
might
have
come
down
from
heaven
on
dove
wings
you
ca
for
a
moment
feel
or
think
that
i
do
realize
and
appreciate
what
you
have
been
to
the
motherless
little
chap
and
for
life
i
am
yours
at
command
as
he
is
i
really
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
to
you
to
have
him
taken
away
from
you
for
just
a
little
while
right
now
and
i
still
think
it
is
best
but
not
unless
you
consent
you
shall
have
him
back
whenever
you
are
ready
for
him
and
at
all
times
both
he
and
i
are
at
your
service
to
the
whole
of
our
kingdoms
just
think
the
matter
over
wo
you
and
decide
what
you
want
me
to
do
something
in
me
died
for
ever
i
think
when
he
spoke
to
me
like
that
he
not
like
other
men
and
there
are
any
other
men
on
earth
but
him
all
the
rest
are
just
bugs
or
bats
or
something
worse
and
i
not
anything
myself
there
no
excuse
for
my
living
and
i
wish
i
was
so
healthy
and
likely
to
go
on
doing
it
it
was
all
over
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
live
for
and
before
i
could
stop
myself
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
billy
asked
me
to
go
with
him
on
this
awful
whale
hunt
i
sobbed
out
to
comfort
myself
with
the
thought
that
somebody
did
care
for
me
regardless
of
just
how
i
was
further
embarrassing
and
complicating
myself
in
the
affairs
of
the
two
men
i
had
thought
i
owned
and
was
now
finding
out
that
i
had
to
give
up
i
wish
i
had
been
looking
at
him
for
i
felt
him
start
but
he
said
in
his
big
friendly
voice
that
is
so
much
and
never
enough
for
me
well
why
not
you
and
al
come
along
and
make
it
a
family
party
if
that
is
what
suits
bill
the
boss
if
men
would
just
buy
good
sharp
kitchen
knives
and
cut
out
hearts
in
a
businesslike
way
it
would
be
so
much
kinder
of
them
why
do
they
prefer
to
use
dull
weapons
that
mash
the
life
out
slowly
everything
is
at
an
end
for
me
and
that
blow
did
it
it
was
a
horrible
cruel
thing
for
him
to
say
to
me
i
know
now
that
i
have
been
in
love
with
john
moore
for
longer
than
my
honor
lets
me
admit
and
that
i
never
love
anybody
else
and
that
also
i
have
offered
myself
to
him
served
up
in
every
known
enticement
and
have
had
to
be
refused
at
least
twice
a
day
for
a
year
a
widow
ca
say
she
did
understand
what
she
was
doing
even
to
herself
but
my
humiliation
is
complete
and
the
only
thing
that
can
make
me
ever
hold
up
my
head
is
to
puzzle
him
by
by
marrying
alfred
bennett
and
quick
of
course
he
must
suspect
how
i
feel
about
him
for
two
people
both
be
so
ignorant
as
not
to
see
such
an
enormous
thing
as
my
love
for
him
is
and
i
was
the
blind
one
but
he
must
never
never
know
that
i
ever
realized
it
for
he
is
so
good
that
it
would
distress
him
i
must
just
go
on
in
my
foolish
way
with
him
until
i
can
get
away
i
tell
him
i
sorry
i
was
so
indignant
and
say
that
i
think
it
will
be
fine
for
him
to
take
my
billy
away
from
me
with
him
i
must
smile
at
the
idea
of
having
my
very
soul
amputated
insist
that
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
and
pack
up
the
little
soul
in
a
steamer
trunk
with
the
smile
just
smile
that
is
all
life
demands
smiles
from
a
woman
even
if
she
must
crush
their
perfume
from
her
own
heart
and
she
generally
has
them
ready
oh
molly
molly
is
it
for
this
you
came
into
the
world
twice
to
give
yourself
without
love
what
difference
does
it
make
that
your
arms
are
strong
and
white
if
they
ca
clasp
him
to
the
softness
and
fragrance
of
your
breast
why
are
your
eyes
blue
pools
of
love
if
they
are
not
for
his
questioning
and
what
are
your
rose
lips
for
if
they
quench
not
his
thirst
illustration
what
are
your
rose
lips
for
yes
i
know
god
is
very
tender
with
a
woman
and
i
think
he
understands
so
if
she
crept
very
close
to
him
and
caught
at
his
sleeve
to
steady
herself
he
would
be
kind
to
her
until
she
could
go
on
along
her
own
steep
way
please
god
never
let
him
find
out
for
it
would
hurt
him
to
have
hurt
me
leaf
eight
melted
some
days
are
like
the
miracle
flowers
that
open
in
the
garden
from
plants
you
did
expect
to
bloom
at
all
i
might
have
been
born
lived
and
died
without
having
this
one
come
into
my
life
and
now
that
i
have
had
it
i
do
know
how
to
write
it
except
in
the
crimson
of
blood
the
blue
of
flame
the
gold
of
glory
and
a
tinge
of
light
green
would
well
express
the
part
i
have
played
but
it
is
all
over
at
last
and
ruth
chester
was
the
unfolding
of
the
first
and
i
got
a
glimpse
of
a
heart
of
gold
that
i
feel
dumb
with
worship
to
think
of
she
god
own
good
woman
and
he
made
her
in
one
of
his
holy
hours
i
wish
i
could
have
borne
her
or
she
me
and
the
tenderness
of
her
arms
was
a
sacrament
we
two
women
just
stood
aside
with
life
artifices
and
concealments
and
let
our
own
hearts
do
the
talking
she
said
she
had
come
because
she
felt
that
if
she
talked
with
me
i
might
be
better
able
to
understand
alfred
when
he
came
and
that
she
had
seen
that
the
judge
was
very
determined
and
she
thoroughly
recognized
his
force
of
character
we
stopped
there
while
i
gave
her
the
document
to
read
i
suppose
it
was
dishonorable
but
i
needed
her
protection
from
it
i
glad
she
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
walk
with
a
head
high
in
the
air
to
judy
range
and
burn
it
up
anything
might
have
happened
if
she
had
and
even
now
i
feel
that
only
my
marriage
vows
will
close
up
the
case
for
the
judge
even
yet
he
may
but
when
ruth
had
got
done
with
alfred
she
had
wiped
judge
wade
appreciation
of
him
completely
off
my
mind
and
destroyed
it
in
tender
words
that
burned
us
both
worse
than
judy
fire
burned
the
letter
she
did
me
an
awfully
good
service
and
so
you
see
you
lovely
woman
you
do
you
not
that
god
has
made
you
for
him
as
a
tribute
to
his
greatness
and
it
is
given
to
you
to
fulfil
a
destiny
she
was
so
beautiful
as
she
said
it
that
i
had
to
turn
my
eyes
away
but
i
felt
as
i
did
when
those
awful
from
carter
words
were
spoken
over
me
by
raines
the
methodist
minister
it
made
me
wild
and
before
i
knew
it
i
had
poured
out
the
whole
truth
to
her
in
a
perfect
cataract
of
words
the
truth
always
acts
on
women
as
some
hitherto
untried
drug
and
you
can
never
tell
what
the
reaction
is
going
to
be
in
this
case
i
was
stricken
dumb
and
found
it
hard
to
see
oh
dear
heart
she
exclaimed
as
she
reached
out
and
drew
me
into
her
lovely
gracious
arms
then
the
privilege
is
all
the
more
wonderful
for
you
as
you
make
some
sacrifice
to
complete
his
life
having
suffered
this
you
will
be
all
the
greater
woman
to
understand
him
i
accept
my
own
sorrow
at
his
hands
willingly
as
it
gives
me
the
larger
sympathy
for
his
work
though
he
will
no
longer
need
my
personal
encouragement
as
he
has
for
years
in
the
light
of
his
love
this
lesser
feeling
for
doctor
moore
will
soon
pass
away
and
the
accord
between
you
will
be
complete
this
was
more
than
i
could
stand
and
feeling
less
than
a
worm
i
turned
my
face
into
her
breast
and
wailed
now
who
would
have
thought
that
girl
could
dance
as
she
did
by
this
time
i
was
in
such
a
solution
of
grief
that
i
would
soon
have
had
to
be
sopped
up
with
a
sponge
if
pet
had
run
in
bubbling
over
like
a
lovely
white
glass
of
rhine
wine
and
seltzer
happiness
has
a
habit
of
not
even
acknowledging
the
presence
of
grief
and
pet
did
seem
to
see
our
red
noses
crushed
draperies
and
generally
damp
atmosphere
molly
she
said
with
a
deliciously
young
giggle
tom
says
for
you
to
send
him
ten
dollars
to
spend
getting
the
brass
band
half
drunk
before
the
six
train
on
which
your
bennett
comes
he
has
spent
five
dollars
paying
the
negroes
to
polish
up
their
instruments
and
clean
up
the
uniforms
and
it
cost
him
to
bail
the
cornettist
out
of
jail
for
roost
robbing
and
it
takes
a
whole
gallon
of
whisky
to
get
any
spirit
into
the
drummer
he
says
tell
you
that
as
this
is
your
shindig
you
ought
at
least
to
pay
the
piper
hurry
up
he
waiting
for
me
and
here
the
kiss
he
told
me
to
put
on
your
left
ear
i
suppose
you
delivered
that
kiss
straight
from
where
he
gave
it
to
you
pettie
dear
i
had
the
spirit
to
say
as
i
went
over
to
the
desk
for
my
why
molly
you
know
me
better
than
that
she
exclaimed
from
behind
a
perfect
rose
cloud
of
blushes
i
know
tom
better
than
i
do
you
i
answered
as
she
fled
with
the
ten
in
her
hand
i
looked
at
ruth
chester
and
we
both
laughed
it
is
true
that
a
broader
sympathy
is
one
of
the
of
sorrow
and
a
week
ago
i
might
have
resented
pet
to
a
marked
degree
instead
of
giving
her
the
ten
dollars
and
a
blessing
i
going
quick
molly
with
that
laugh
between
us
ruth
said
as
she
rose
and
took
me
into
her
arms
again
for
just
half
a
second
and
before
i
could
stop
her
she
was
gone
she
met
billy
toiling
up
the
front
step
with
a
long
piece
of
rusty
iron
which
took
off
an
inch
of
paint
as
it
bumped
against
the
edge
of
the
porch
she
bent
down
and
kissed
the
back
of
his
neck
which
theft
was
almost
more
than
i
could
stand
and
apparently
more
than
billy
was
prepared
to
accept
go
way
girl
he
said
in
his
rudest
manner
do
you
see
i
busy
i
met
him
in
the
front
hall
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
hopeless
scar
on
my
hardwood
floor
he
was
hot
perspiring
and
panting
but
full
of
triumph
i
found
it
molly
i
found
it
he
exclaimed
as
he
let
the
heavy
pipe
drop
almost
on
the
bare
pink
toes
you
can
git
a
hammer
and
pound
the
end
sharp
and
bend
it
so
no
whale
we
ketch
can
git
away
for
nothing
you
and
doc
kin
put
it
in
your
trunk
it
too
long
for
mine
and
i
can
carry
doc
shirts
and
things
in
mine
git
the
hammer
quick
and
help
you
fix
it
the
pain
in
my
breast
was
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
lover
i
said
as
i
knelt
down
by
him
in
the
dim
old
hall
and
put
my
arms
around
him
as
if
to
shield
him
from
some
blow
i
could
help
being
aimed
at
him
you
would
mind
much
would
you
if
just
this
time
your
molly
could
go
with
you
your
father
is
going
to
take
good
care
of
you
and
and
maybe
bring
you
back
to
me
some
day
why
molly
he
said
flaring
his
astonished
blue
eyes
at
me
me
to
be
took
care
of
i
ai
to
leave
you
here
for
maybe
a
bear
to
come
out
of
a
circus
and
eat
you
up
with
me
and
doc
gone
doc
ai
no
good
and
maybe
would
help
me
hold
the
rope
right
to
keep
the
whale
from
gitting
away
he
do
know
how
to
do
like
i
tell
him
like
you
do
try
him
lover
and
maybe
he
will
will
learn
to
i
could
help
the
tears
that
came
to
stop
my
words
now
you
see
molly
how
you
cry
with
that
gone
he
said
with
an
amused
manly
little
tenderness
in
his
voice
that
i
had
never
heard
before
and
he
cuddled
his
lips
against
mine
in
almost
the
only
voluntary
kiss
he
had
given
me
since
i
had
got
him
into
his
ridiculous
little
trousers
under
his
blouses
you
can
have
most
a
hundred
kisses
every
night
if
you
do
say
no
more
about
not
and
fix
that
whale
hook
for
me
quick
he
coaxed
against
my
cheek
oh
little
lover
little
lover
you
did
know
what
you
were
saying
with
your
baby
wisdom
and
your
little
paddie
burned
the
on
my
breast
like
a
terrible
white
heat
from
which
i
was
powerless
to
defend
myself
you
are
mine
you
are
you
you
are
soul
of
my
soul
and
heart
of
my
heart
and
spirit
of
my
spirit
and
and
you
ought
to
have
been
flesh
of
my
flesh
i
do
know
how
i
managed
to
answer
johnson
call
from
my
front
gate
but
i
sometimes
think
that
women
have
a
clause
in
their
constitutions
she
and
aunt
bettie
had
just
come
up
the
street
from
aunt
bettie
house
and
the
pollard
cook
was
following
them
with
a
large
basket
in
which
were
packed
the
things
aunt
bettie
was
contributing
to
the
entertainment
of
the
distinguished
citizen
johnson
is
alfred
nearest
kinsman
in
hillsboro
and
of
course
he
is
to
be
their
guest
while
he
is
in
town
he
be
feeding
his
eyes
on
molly
so
he
not
even
know
he
eating
my
washington
almond
pudding
with
thomas
old
port
in
it
teased
aunt
bettie
with
a
laugh
as
i
went
across
the
street
with
them
there
going
to
be
a
regular
epidemic
of
love
in
hillsboro
i
do
believe
she
continued
in
her
usual
strain
of
sentimental
speculation
i
saw
graves
talking
to
delia
hawes
in
front
of
the
store
an
hour
ago
as
i
came
out
from
looking
at
the
blue
chintz
to
match
pet
for
the
west
wing
and
they
were
both
so
absorbed
they
did
even
see
me
that
was
what
might
have
been
called
a
conflagration
dinner
you
gave
the
other
night
molly
in
more
ways
than
one
i
wish
a
spark
had
set
off
benton
wade
and
henrietta
too
maybe
it
did
but
is
just
taking
fire
slowly
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
just
to
let
aunt
bettie
blindfold
every
unmarried
person
in
this
town
and
marry
them
to
the
first
person
they
touch
hands
with
it
would
be
fun
for
her
and
then
we
could
have
peace
and
apparently
as
much
happiness
as
we
are
going
to
have
anyway
johnson
seemed
to
be
in
somewhat
the
same
state
of
mind
as
i
found
myself
humph
she
said
as
we
went
up
the
front
steps
i
be
glad
when
you
are
married
and
settled
molly
carter
so
the
rest
of
this
town
can
quiet
down
into
peace
once
more
and
i
sincerely
hope
every
woman
under
fifty
in
hillsboro
who
is
already
married
will
stay
in
that
state
until
she
reaches
that
age
but
i
do
believe
if
the
law
marched
widows
from
grave
number
one
to
altar
number
two
they
would
get
into
trouble
and
fuss
along
the
road
but
come
on
in
both
of
you
and
help
me
get
this
marriage
feast
ready
if
i
must
the
day
is
going
by
on
greased
wheels
and
i
ca
let
johnson
crotchets
be
neglected
al
bennett
or
no
al
bennett
and
from
then
on
for
hours
and
hours
i
was
strapped
to
a
torture
wheel
that
turned
and
turned
minute
after
minute
as
it
ground
spice
and
sugar
and
bridal
meats
and
me
relentlessly
into
a
great
suffering
pulp
could
i
ever
in
all
my
life
have
hungered
for
food
and
been
able
to
get
it
past
the
lump
in
my
throat
that
grew
larger
with
the
seconds
and
if
alfred
pudding
tasted
of
the
salt
of
dead
this
evening
it
was
from
my
surreptitious
tears
that
dripped
into
it
it
was
late
very
late
before
johnson
realized
it
and
shooed
me
home
to
get
ready
to
go
to
the
train
along
with
the
brass
band
and
all
the
other
welcomes
i
hurried
all
i
could
but
for
long
minutes
i
stood
in
front
of
my
mirror
and
questioned
myself
could
this
slow
pale
slim
drooping
girl
be
the
rollicking
child
of
a
molly
who
had
looked
out
of
that
mirror
at
me
one
short
week
ago
where
were
the
wings
on
her
heels
the
glint
in
her
curls
the
laugh
on
her
mouth
and
the
devil
in
her
eyes
slowly
at
last
i
lifted
the
blue
muslin
waist
shroud
and
let
it
slip
over
my
head
and
fall
slimly
around
me
i
had
fastened
the
neck
button
and
was
fumbling
the
next
one
into
the
buttonhole
when
i
suddenly
heard
laughing
excited
voices
coming
up
the
side
street
that
ran
just
under
my
west
window
something
told
me
that
alfred
had
come
on
the
train
instead
of
the
and
i
fairly
reeled
to
the
window
and
peeped
through
the
shutters
they
were
all
in
a
laughing
group
around
him
with
tom
as
master
of
ceremonies
and
ruth
chester
was
looking
up
into
his
face
with
an
expression
i
am
glad
i
can
never
forget
it
killed
all
my
regrets
on
the
score
of
his
future
it
took
two
good
looks
to
take
him
all
in
and
then
i
must
have
missed
some
of
him
for
all
in
all
he
was
so
large
that
he
stretched
your
eyes
to
behold
him
he
grown
seven
feet
tall
i
do
know
how
many
pounds
he
weighs
and
i
do
want
anybody
ever
to
tell
me
i
had
never
thought
enough
about
evolution
to
know
whether
i
believed
in
it
and
woman
suffrage
but
i
do
now
i
know
that
millions
of
years
ago
a
great
big
distinguished
hippopotamus
stepped
out
of
the
woods
and
frightened
one
of
my
foremothers
so
that
she
turned
tail
and
fled
through
a
thicket
that
almost
tore
her
limb
from
limb
right
into
the
arms
of
her
own
mate
that
what
i
did
i
caught
that
blue
satin
belt
together
with
one
hand
and
ran
through
my
garden
right
over
a
bed
of
savage
and
flung
myself
into
john
moore
office
slammed
the
door
and
backed
up
against
it
he
come
i
gasped
and
i
frightened
to
death
with
nobody
but
you
to
run
to
hide
me
quick
he
fat
and
i
him
i
was
that
deadly
cold
you
can
get
when
fear
runs
into
your
very
marrow
and
congeals
the
blood
in
your
arteries
quick
quick
i
panted
he
must
have
been
as
pale
as
i
was
and
for
an
eternity
of
a
second
he
looked
at
me
then
suddenly
heaven
shone
from
his
eyes
and
he
opened
his
arms
to
me
with
just
one
word
here
i
went
he
held
me
gently
for
a
and
then
with
a
sob
which
i
felt
rather
than
heard
he
crushed
me
to
him
and
stopped
my
breath
with
his
lips
on
mine
i
understood
things
then
that
i
never
had
before
and
i
felt
that
wise
guardian
take
his
fingers
from
mine
and
leave
me
safe
at
last
i
raised
my
hand
and
pressed
it
against
john
wet
lashes
until
he
could
let
me
speak
and
i
was
melted
into
his
very
breast
itself
molly
he
said
when
enough
tenderness
had
come
back
into
his
arms
to
let
me
breathe
you
have
almost
killed
me
you
i
exclaimed
crowding
still
closer
or
at
least
trying
to
not
it
i
that
am
killed
and
you
did
it
i
know
you
really
want
me
but
i
ca
help
that
i
rather
you
do
the
suffering
with
me
than
to
do
it
myself
away
from
you
i
so
hungry
and
thirsty
for
you
that
that
i
ca
diet
any
longer
i
put
the
case
the
strongest
way
i
knew
how
and
got
a
swooning
maddening
luscious
result
want
you
molly
he
almost
sobbed
and
i
felt
his
heart
pounding
hard
next
to
my
shoulder
yes
want
me
i
answered
with
more
spirit
than
breath
left
in
me
i
refuse
to
believe
you
are
as
stupid
as
i
am
and
anybody
with
even
an
ordinary
amount
of
brains
must
have
seen
how
hard
i
was
fighting
for
you
i
feel
sure
i
left
no
stone
unturned
some
of
them
i
can
already
think
back
and
see
myself
tugging
at
and
it
makes
me
hot
all
over
foolish
and
always
was
so
i
to
be
excused
for
acting
that
awful
way
but
you
are
to
blame
for
me
do
it
i
going
to
be
your
punishment
for
life
for
not
having
been
stern
and
stopped
me
you
had
better
stop
me
some
now
anyway
for
if
i
go
on
loving
you
as
i
have
been
for
the
last
few
minutes
it
will
make
you
uncomfortable
peaches
he
said
after
he
had
hushed
me
with
another
broken
dose
of
love
as
large
as
he
thought
i
could
stand
i
could
have
stood
more
i
am
never
going
to
tell
you
how
long
i
have
loved
you
but
that
day
you
came
to
me
all
in
a
flutter
with
al
bennett
letter
in
your
hand
it
is
going
to
take
you
a
lifetime
to
settle
for
you
were
mine
and
bill
how
you
but
women
do
understand
i
felt
him
shudder
in
my
arms
as
i
held
him
close
i
was
repaid
for
all
those
tiresome
exercises
i
had
taken
by
the
strength
to
crush
him
against
my
breast
almost
as
hard
as
he
crushed
me
our
combined
strength
was
terrific
dangerous
to
life
and
ribs
but
heavenly
do
women
know
john
i
managed
to
ask
softly
in
memory
of
a
like
question
he
had
put
to
me
across
that
bread
and
jam
with
the
rose
from
the
dark
what
brought
me
to
consciousness
was
his
fumbling
with
the
buttons
at
the
waist
of
that
blue
muslin
relict
of
a
sentiment
i
had
fastened
but
one
and
the
lace
had
got
caught
on
his
sleeve
buttons
please
do
button
me
into
his
possession
i
laughed
under
his
chin
i
still
scared
to
death
of
him
and
you
have
hid
me
yet
molly
he
asked
this
time
with
a
where
could
you
be
more
effectually
hid
from
al
bennett
than
in
my
arms
i
spent
ten
minutes
telling
billy
what
a
hippopotamus
really
looks
like
as
i
put
him
to
bed
but
later
much
as
i
should
have
liked
to
i
could
consume
that
horrible
dinner
that
i
had
helped
prepare
at
the
johnsons
in
the
shelter
of
john
arms
and
i
had
to
face
alfred
ruth
chester
was
there
and
she
faced
him
too
a
man
that
ca
be
happy
with
a
woman
who
is
willing
to
fulfil
his
destiny
does
deserve
to
be
then
we
came
over
here
and
john
had
the
most
beautiful
time
persuading
aunt
adeline
how
a
good
man
like
carter
would
want
his
young
widow
to
be
taken
care
of
by
being
married
to
a
safe
friend
of
his
instead
of
being
flighty
and
having
folks
wondering
whom
she
would
marry
you
know
yourself
how
hard
a
time
a
beautiful
young
widow
has
henderson
he
said
in
the
tone
of
voice
that
always
makes
his
patients
glad
to
take
his
worst
doses
he
got
his
blessing
and
me
with
a
warning
a
lovely
night
wind
is
blowing
across
my
garden
and
bringing
me
congratulations
from
all
my
flower
family
flowers
are
a
part
of
love
and
the
wooing
of
it
and
they
understand
i
am
waiting
for
the
light
to
go
out
behind
the
tall
trees
over
which
the
moon
is
stealthily
sinking
he
promised
me
to
put
it
out
right
away
and
i
watching
the
glow
that
marks
the
place
where
my
own
two
men
creatures
are
going
to
rest
with
my
heart
in
full
song
he
needs
rest
he
is
so
very
tired
and
worn
he
confessed
it
as
i
stood
on
the
step
above
him
after
he
had
taken
his
own
good
night
from
me
out
on
the
porch
when
he
explained
to
me
how
his
agony
over
me
for
all
these
months
had
kept
him
walking
the
floor
night
after
night
not
knowing
that
i
was
waiting
for
the
light
to
go
out
i
gave
myself
a
sweetness
that
i
am
going
to
say
a
prayer
for
the
last
thing
before
i
sleep
i
took
his
head
in
my
arms
and
pressed
his
cheek
down
against
billy
on
my
breast
over
my
heart
and
put
my
lips
to
that
that
has
tempted
me
for
i
wo
say
how
long
then
i
fled
and
so
did
he
i
had
about
decided
to
burn
this
book
because
i
sha
need
it
any
longer
for
he
says
he
and
billy
and
i
are
going
to
play
so
much
golf
and
tennis
that
i
shall
keep
as
thin
as
he
wants
me
to
be
without
any
more
melting
or
freezing
or
starving
but
perhaps
he
would
like
to
read
the
little
red
devil
do
you
suppose
he
would
