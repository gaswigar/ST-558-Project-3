the
magnificent
ambersons
by

i
major
amberson
had
made
a
fortune
in
when
other
people
were
losing
fortunes
and
the
magnificence
of
the
ambersons
began
then
magnificence
like
the
size
of
a
fortune
is
always
comparative
as
even
magnificent
lorenzo
may
now
perceive
if
he
has
happened
to
haunt
new
york
in
and
the
ambersons
were
magnificent
in
their
day
and
place
their
splendour
lasted
throughout
all
the
years
that
saw
their
midland
town
spread
and
darken
into
a
city
but
reached
its
topmost
during
the
period
when
every
prosperous
family
with
children
kept
a
newfoundland
dog
in
that
town
in
those
days
all
the
women
who
wore
silk
or
velvet
knew
all
the
other
women
who
wore
silk
or
velvet
and
when
there
was
a
new
purchase
of
sealskin
sick
people
were
got
to
windows
to
see
it
go
by
trotters
were
out
in
the
winter
afternoons
racing
light
sleighs
on
national
avenue
and
tennessee
street
everybody
recognized
both
the
trotters
and
the
drivers
and
again
knew
them
as
well
on
summer
evenings
when
slim
buggies
whizzed
by
in
renewals
of
the
rivalry
for
that
matter
everybody
knew
everybody
else
family
could
identify
such
a
silhouette
half
a
mile
down
the
street
and
thereby
was
sure
who
was
going
to
market
or
to
a
reception
or
coming
home
from
office
or
store
to
noon
dinner
or
evening
supper
during
the
earlier
years
of
this
period
elegance
of
personal
appearance
was
believed
to
rest
more
upon
the
texture
of
garments
than
upon
their
shaping
a
silk
dress
needed
no
remodelling
when
it
was
a
year
or
so
old
it
remained
distinguished
by
merely
remaining
silk
old
men
and
governors
wore
broadcloth
full
dress
was
broadcloth
with
doeskin
trousers
and
there
were
seen
men
of
all
ages
to
whom
a
hat
meant
only
that
rigid
tall
silk
thing
known
to
impudence
as
a
in
town
and
country
these
men
would
wear
no
other
hat
and
without
they
went
rowing
in
such
hats
shifting
fashions
of
shape
replaced
aristocracy
of
texture
dressmakers
shoemakers
hatmakers
and
tailors
increasing
in
cunning
and
in
power
found
means
to
make
new
clothes
old
the
long
contagion
of
the
derby
hat
arrived
one
season
the
crown
of
this
hat
would
be
a
bucket
the
next
it
would
be
a
spoon
every
house
still
kept
its
bootjack
but
boots
gave
way
to
shoes
and
congress
gaiters
and
these
were
played
through
fashions
that
shaped
them
now
with
toes
like
and
now
with
toes
like
the
prows
of
racing
shells
trousers
with
a
crease
were
considered
plebeian
the
crease
proved
that
the
garment
had
lain
upon
a
shelf
and
hence
was
these
betraying
trousers
were
called
in
allusion
to
the
shelf
in
the
early
while
bangs
and
bustles
were
having
their
way
with
women
that
variation
of
dandy
known
as
the
dude
was
invented
he
wore
trousers
as
tight
as
stockings
shoes
a
spoon
derby
a
coat
called
a
chesterfield
with
short
flaring
skirts
a
torturing
cylindrical
collar
laundered
to
a
polish
and
three
inches
high
while
his
other
neckgear
might
be
a
heavy
puffed
cravat
or
a
tiny
bow
fit
for
a
doll
braids
with
evening
dress
he
wore
a
tan
overcoat
so
short
that
his
black
hung
visible
five
inches
below
the
but
after
a
season
or
two
he
lengthened
his
overcoat
till
it
touched
his
heels
and
he
passed
out
of
his
tight
trousers
into
trousers
like
great
bags
then
presently
he
was
seen
no
more
though
the
word
that
had
been
coined
for
him
remained
in
the
vocabularies
of
the
impertinent
it
was
a
hairier
day
than
this
beards
were
to
the
wearers
fancy
and
things
as
strange
as
the
kaiserliche
moustache
were
commonplace
found
nourishment
upon
childlike
profiles
great
dundreary
whiskers
blew
like
tippets
over
young
shoulders
moustaches
were
trained
as
lambrequins
over
forgotten
mouths
and
it
was
possible
for
a
senator
of
the
united
states
to
wear
a
mist
of
white
whisker
upon
his
throat
only
not
a
newspaper
in
the
land
finding
the
ornament
distinguished
enough
to
warrant
a
lampoon
surely
no
more
is
needed
to
prove
that
so
short
a
time
ago
we
were
living
in
another
age
at
the
beginning
of
the
ambersons
great
period
most
of
the
houses
of
the
midland
town
were
of
a
pleasant
architecture
they
lacked
style
but
also
lacked
pretentiousness
and
whatever
does
not
pretend
at
all
has
style
enough
they
stood
in
commodious
yards
well
shaded
by
leftover
forest
trees
elm
and
walnut
and
beech
with
here
and
there
a
line
of
tall
sycamores
where
the
land
had
been
made
by
filling
bayous
from
the
creek
the
house
of
a
prominent
resident
facing
military
square
or
national
avenue
or
tennessee
street
was
built
of
brick
upon
a
stone
foundation
or
of
wood
upon
a
brick
foundation
usually
it
had
a
front
porch
and
a
back
porch
often
a
side
porch
too
there
was
a
front
hall
there
was
a
side
hall
and
sometimes
a
back
from
the
front
hall
opened
three
rooms
the
parlour
the
sitting
room
and
the
library
and
the
library
could
show
warrant
to
its
title
for
some
reason
these
people
bought
books
commonly
the
family
sat
more
in
the
library
than
in
the
sitting
room
while
callers
when
they
came
formally
were
kept
to
the
parlour
a
place
of
formidable
polish
and
discomfort
the
upholstery
of
the
library
furniture
was
a
little
shabby
but
the
hostile
chairs
and
sofa
of
the
parlour
always
looked
new
for
all
the
wear
and
tear
they
got
they
should
have
lasted
a
thousand
years
upstairs
were
the
bedrooms
room
the
largest
a
smaller
room
for
one
or
two
sons
another
for
one
or
two
daughters
each
of
these
rooms
containing
a
double
bed
a
washstand
a
bureau
a
wardrobe
a
little
table
a
and
often
a
chair
or
two
that
had
been
slightly
damaged
downstairs
but
not
enough
to
justify
either
the
expense
of
repair
or
decisive
abandonment
in
the
attic
and
there
was
always
a
for
visitors
where
the
usually
was
kept
and
during
the
there
developed
an
appreciation
of
the
necessity
for
a
bathroom
therefore
the
architects
placed
bathrooms
in
the
new
houses
and
the
older
houses
tore
out
a
cupboard
or
two
set
up
a
boiler
beside
the
kitchen
stove
and
sought
a
new
godliness
each
with
its
own
bathroom
the
great
american
plumber
joke
that
evergreen
was
planted
at
this
time
at
the
rear
of
the
house
upstairs
was
a
bleak
little
chamber
called
the
girl
room
and
in
the
stable
there
was
another
bedroom
adjoining
the
hayloft
and
called
the
hired
man
house
and
stable
cost
seven
or
eight
thousand
dollars
to
build
and
people
with
that
much
money
to
invest
in
such
comforts
were
classified
as
the
rich
they
paid
the
inhabitant
of
the
girl
room
two
dollars
a
week
and
in
the
latter
part
of
this
period
two
dollars
and
a
half
and
finally
three
dollars
a
week
she
was
irish
ordinarily
or
german
or
it
might
be
scandinavian
but
never
native
to
the
land
unless
she
happened
to
be
a
person
of
colour
the
man
or
youth
who
lived
in
the
stable
had
like
wages
and
sometimes
he
too
was
lately
a
steerage
voyager
but
much
oftener
he
was
coloured
after
sunrise
on
pleasant
mornings
the
alleys
behind
the
stables
were
gay
laughter
and
shouting
went
up
and
down
their
dusty
lengths
with
a
lively
accompaniment
of
knocking
against
back
fences
and
stable
walls
for
the
darkies
loved
to
curry
their
horses
in
the
alley
darkies
always
prefer
to
gossip
in
shouts
instead
of
whispers
and
they
feel
that
profanity
unless
it
be
vociferous
is
almost
worthless
horrible
phrases
were
caught
by
early
rising
children
and
carried
to
older
people
for
definition
sometimes
at
inopportune
moments
while
less
investigative
children
would
often
merely
repeat
the
phrases
in
some
subsequent
flurry
of
agitation
and
yet
bring
about
consequences
so
emphatic
as
to
be
recalled
with
ease
in
middle
life
they
have
passed
those
darky
of
the
midland
town
and
the
introspective
horses
they
curried
and
brushed
and
whacked
and
amiably
cursed
those
good
old
horses
switch
their
tails
at
flies
no
more
for
all
their
seeming
permanence
they
might
as
well
have
been
buffaloes
or
the
buffalo
laprobes
that
grew
bald
in
patches
and
used
to
slide
from
the
careless
drivers
knees
and
hang
unconcerned
half
way
to
the
ground
the
stables
have
been
transformed
into
other
likenesses
or
swept
away
like
the
woodsheds
where
were
kept
the
and
kindling
that
the
girl
and
the
always
quarrelled
over
who
should
fetch
it
horse
and
stable
and
woodshed
and
the
whole
tribe
of
the
all
are
gone
they
went
quickly
yet
so
silently
that
we
whom
they
served
have
not
yet
really
noticed
that
they
are
vanished
so
with
other
vanishings
there
were
the
little
bunty
on
the
long
single
track
that
went
its
troubled
way
among
the
cobblestones
at
the
rear
door
of
the
car
there
was
no
platform
but
a
step
where
passengers
clung
in
wet
clumps
when
the
weather
was
bad
and
the
car
crowded
the
patrons
if
not
too
put
their
fares
into
a
slot
and
no
conductor
paced
the
heaving
floor
but
the
driver
would
rap
remindingly
with
his
elbow
upon
the
glass
of
the
door
to
his
little
open
platform
if
the
nickels
and
the
passengers
did
not
appear
to
coincide
in
number
a
lone
mule
drew
the
car
and
sometimes
drew
it
off
the
track
when
the
passengers
would
get
out
and
push
it
on
again
they
really
owed
it
courtesies
like
this
for
the
car
was
genially
accommodating
a
lady
could
whistle
to
it
from
an
upstairs
window
and
the
car
would
halt
at
once
and
wait
for
her
while
she
shut
the
window
put
on
her
hat
and
cloak
went
downstairs
found
an
umbrella
told
the
girl
what
to
have
for
dinner
and
came
forth
from
the
house
the
previous
passengers
made
little
objection
to
such
gallantry
on
the
part
of
the
car
they
were
wont
to
expect
as
much
for
themselves
on
like
occasion
in
good
weather
the
mule
pulled
the
car
a
mile
in
a
little
less
than
twenty
minutes
unless
the
stops
were
too
long
but
when
the
came
doing
its
mile
in
five
minutes
and
better
it
would
wait
for
nobody
nor
could
its
passengers
have
endured
such
a
thing
because
the
faster
they
were
carried
the
less
time
they
had
to
spare
in
the
days
before
deathly
contrivances
hustled
them
through
their
lives
and
when
they
had
no
telephones
another
ancient
vacancy
profoundly
responsible
for
leisure
they
had
time
for
everything
time
to
think
to
talk
time
to
read
time
to
wait
for
a
lady
they
even
had
time
to
dance
square
dances
quadrilles
and
lancers
they
also
danced
the
racquette
and
schottisches
and
polkas
and
such
whims
as
the
portland
they
pushed
back
the
sliding
doors
between
the
parlour
and
the
sitting
room
tacked
down
crash
over
the
carpets
hired
a
few
palms
in
green
tubs
stationed
three
or
four
italian
musicians
under
the
stairway
in
the
front
hall
and
had
great
nights
but
these
people
were
gayest
on
new
year
day
they
made
it
a
true
festival
something
no
longer
known
the
women
gathered
to
assist
the
hostesses
who
kept
open
house
and
the
carefree
men
dandified
and
perfumed
went
about
in
sleighs
or
in
carriages
and
ponderous
hacks
going
from
open
house
to
open
house
leaving
fantastic
cards
in
fancy
baskets
as
they
entered
each
doorway
and
emerging
a
little
later
more
carefree
than
ever
if
the
punch
had
been
to
their
liking
it
always
was
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
pedestrians
saw
great
gesturing
and
waving
of
lemon
gloves
while
ruinous
fragments
of
song
were
dropped
behind
as
the
carriages
rolled
up
and
down
the
streets
keeping
open
house
was
a
merry
custom
it
has
gone
like
the
picnic
in
the
woods
and
like
that
prettiest
of
all
vanished
customs
the
serenade
when
a
lively
girl
visited
the
town
she
did
not
long
go
unserenaded
though
a
visitor
was
not
indeed
needed
to
excuse
a
serenade
of
a
summer
night
young
men
would
bring
an
orchestra
under
a
pretty
girl
window
or
it
might
be
her
father
or
that
of
an
ailing
maiden
aunt
and
flute
harp
fiddle
cornet
and
bass
viol
would
presently
release
to
the
dulcet
stars
such
melodies
as
sing
through
you
remember
me
i
dreamt
that
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
silver
threads
among
the
gold
kathleen
mavourneen
or
the
soldier
they
had
other
music
to
offer
too
for
these
were
the
happy
days
of
olivette
and
the
macotte
and
the
chimes
of
normandy
and
and
fra
better
than
that
these
were
the
days
of
pinafore
and
the
pirates
of
penzance
and
of
this
last
was
needed
in
the
midland
town
as
elsewhere
for
the
aesthetic
movement
had
reached
thus
far
from
london
and
terrible
things
were
being
done
to
honest
old
furniture
maidens
sawed
in
two
and
gilded
the
remains
they
took
the
rockers
from
and
gilded
the
inadequate
legs
they
gilded
the
easels
that
supported
the
crayon
portraits
of
their
deceased
uncles
in
the
new
spirit
of
art
they
sold
old
clocks
for
new
and
threw
wax
flowers
and
wax
fruit
and
the
protecting
glass
domes
out
upon
the
they
filled
vases
with
peacock
feathers
or
cattails
or
sumac
or
sunflowers
and
set
the
vases
upon
mantelpieces
and
tables
they
embroidered
daisies
which
they
called
marguerites
and
sunflowers
and
sumac
and
and
owls
and
peacock
feathers
upon
plush
screens
and
upon
heavy
cushions
then
strewed
these
cushions
upon
floors
where
fathers
fell
over
them
in
the
dark
in
the
teeth
of
sinful
oratory
the
daughters
went
on
embroidering
they
embroidered
daisies
and
sunflowers
and
sumac
and
and
owls
and
peacock
feathers
upon
throws
which
they
had
the
courage
to
drape
upon
horsehair
sofas
they
painted
owls
and
daisies
and
sunflowers
and
sumac
and
and
peacock
feathers
upon
tambourines
they
hung
chinese
umbrellas
of
paper
to
the
chandeliers
they
nailed
paper
fans
to
the
walls
they
studied
painting
on
china
these
girls
they
sang
tosti
new
songs
they
sometimes
still
practiced
the
old
genteel
habit
of
and
were
most
charming
of
all
when
they
drove
forth
three
or
four
in
a
basket
phaeton
on
a
spring
morning
croquet
and
the
mildest
archery
ever
known
were
the
sports
of
people
still
young
and
active
enough
for
so
much
exertion
played
euchre
there
was
a
theatre
next
door
to
the
amberson
hotel
and
when
edwin
booth
came
for
a
night
everybody
who
could
afford
to
buy
a
ticket
was
there
and
all
the
hacks
in
town
were
hired
the
black
crook
also
filled
the
theatre
but
the
audience
then
was
almost
entirely
of
men
who
looked
uneasy
as
they
left
for
home
when
the
final
curtain
fell
upon
the
shocking
girls
dressed
as
fairies
but
the
theatre
did
not
often
do
so
well
the
people
of
the
town
were
still
too
thrifty
they
were
thrifty
because
they
were
the
sons
or
grandsons
of
the
early
settlers
who
had
opened
the
wilderness
and
had
reached
it
from
the
east
and
the
south
with
wagons
and
axes
and
guns
but
with
no
money
at
all
the
pioneers
were
thrifty
or
they
would
have
perished
they
had
to
store
away
food
for
the
winter
or
goods
to
trade
for
food
and
they
often
feared
they
had
not
stored
enough
they
left
traces
of
that
fear
in
their
sons
and
grandsons
in
the
minds
of
most
of
these
indeed
their
thrift
was
next
to
their
religion
to
save
even
for
the
sake
of
saving
was
their
earliest
lesson
and
discipline
no
matter
how
prosperous
they
were
they
could
not
spend
money
either
upon
art
or
upon
mere
luxury
and
entertainment
without
a
sense
of
sin
against
so
homespun
a
background
the
magnificence
of
the
ambersons
was
as
conspicuous
as
a
brass
band
at
a
funeral
major
amberson
bought
two
hundred
acres
of
land
at
the
end
of
national
avenue
and
through
this
tract
he
built
broad
streets
and
paved
them
with
cedar
block
and
curbed
them
with
stone
he
set
up
fountains
here
and
there
where
the
streets
intersected
and
at
symmetrical
intervals
placed
statues
painted
white
with
their
titles
clear
upon
the
pedestals
minerva
mercury
hercules
venus
gladiator
emperor
augustus
fisher
boy
mastiff
greyhound
fawn
antelope
wounded
doe
and
wounded
lion
most
of
the
forest
trees
had
been
left
to
flourish
still
and
at
some
distance
or
by
moonlight
the
place
was
in
truth
beautiful
but
the
ardent
citizen
loving
to
see
his
city
grow
wanted
neither
distance
nor
moonlight
he
had
not
seen
versailles
but
standing
before
the
fountain
of
neptune
in
amberson
addition
at
bright
noon
and
quoting
the
favourite
comparison
of
the
local
newspapers
he
declared
versailles
outdone
all
this
art
showed
a
profit
from
the
start
for
the
lots
sold
well
and
there
was
something
like
a
rush
to
build
in
the
new
addition
its
main
thoroughfare
an
oblique
continuation
of
national
avenue
was
called
amberson
boulevard
and
here
at
the
juncture
of
the
new
boulevard
and
the
avenue
major
amberson
reserved
four
acres
for
himself
and
built
his
new
house
the
amberson
mansion
of
course
this
house
was
the
pride
of
the
town
faced
with
stone
as
far
back
as
the
windows
it
was
a
house
of
arches
and
turrets
and
girdling
stone
porches
it
had
the
first
seen
in
that
town
there
was
a
central
front
hall
with
a
great
black
walnut
stairway
and
open
to
a
green
glass
skylight
called
the
dome
three
stories
above
the
ground
floor
a
ballroom
occupied
most
of
the
third
story
and
at
one
end
of
it
was
a
carved
walnut
gallery
for
the
musicians
citizens
told
strangers
that
the
cost
of
all
this
black
walnut
and
was
sixty
thousand
dollars
sixty
thousand
dollars
for
the
alone
yes
sir
and
hardwood
floors
all
over
the
house
turkish
rugs
and
no
carpets
at
all
except
a
brussels
carpet
in
the
front
parlour
i
hear
they
call
it
the
hot
and
cold
water
upstairs
and
down
and
stationary
washstands
in
every
last
bedroom
in
the
place
their
sideboard
built
right
into
the
house
and
goes
all
the
way
across
one
end
of
the
dining
room
it
is
walnut
it
solid
mahogany
not
veneering
solid
mahogany
well
sir
i
presume
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
be
tickled
to
swap
the
white
house
for
the
new
amberson
mansion
if
the
major
give
him
the
chance
but
by
the
almighty
dollar
you
bet
your
sweet
life
the
major
would
the
visitor
to
the
town
was
certain
to
receive
further
enlightenment
for
there
was
one
form
of
entertainment
never
omitted
he
was
always
patriotically
taken
for
a
little
drive
around
our
city
even
if
his
host
had
to
hire
a
hack
and
the
climax
of
the
display
was
the
amberson
mansion
look
at
that
greenhouse
they
put
up
there
in
the
side
yard
the
escort
would
continue
and
look
at
that
brick
stable
most
folks
would
think
that
stable
plenty
big
enough
and
good
enough
to
live
in
it
got
running
water
and
four
rooms
upstairs
for
two
hired
men
and
one
of
family
to
live
in
they
keep
one
hired
man
loafin
in
the
house
and
they
got
a
married
hired
man
out
in
the
stable
and
his
wife
does
the
washing
they
got
for
four
horses
and
they
keep
a
coupay
and
some
new
kinds
of
fancy
rigs
you
never
saw
the
beat
of
they
call
two
of
up
in
the
air
they
are
too
high
for
me
i
guess
they
got
every
new
kind
of
fancy
rig
in
there
that
been
invented
and
harness
well
everybody
in
town
can
tell
when
ambersons
are
out
driving
after
dark
by
the
jingle
this
town
never
did
see
so
much
style
as
ambersons
are
putting
on
these
days
and
i
guess
going
to
be
expensive
because
a
lot
of
other
folks
try
to
keep
up
with
the
major
wife
and
the
daughter
been
to
europe
and
my
wife
tells
me
since
they
got
back
they
make
tea
there
every
afternoon
about
five
and
drink
it
seems
to
me
it
would
go
against
a
person
stomach
just
before
supper
like
that
and
anyway
tea
is
fit
for
much
not
unless
you
sick
or
something
my
wife
says
ambersons
do
make
lettuce
salad
the
way
other
people
do
they
do
chop
it
up
with
sugar
and
vinegar
at
all
they
pour
olive
oil
on
it
with
their
vinegar
and
they
have
it
separate
not
along
with
the
rest
of
the
meal
and
they
eat
these
olives
too
green
things
they
are
something
like
a
hard
plum
but
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
they
tasted
a
good
deal
like
a
bad
my
wife
says
she
going
to
buy
some
you
got
to
eat
nine
and
then
you
get
to
like
she
says
well
i
would
eat
nine
bad
to
get
to
like
them
and
i
going
to
let
these
olives
alone
kind
of
a
woman
dish
anyway
i
suspect
but
most
be
makin
a
stagger
to
worm
through
nine
of
now
ambersons
brought
to
town
yes
sir
the
rest
eat
whether
they
get
sick
or
not
looks
to
me
like
some
people
in
this
city
be
willing
to
go
crazy
if
they
thought
that
would
help
to
be
as
as
ambersons
old
aleck
minafer
he
about
the
closest
old
codger
we
got
he
come
in
my
office
the
other
day
and
he
pretty
near
had
a
stroke
tellin
me
about
his
daughter
fanny
seems
miss
isabel
amberson
got
some
kind
of
a
dog
they
call
it
a
saint
bernard
and
fanny
was
bound
to
have
one
too
well
old
aleck
told
her
he
did
like
dogs
except
because
a
cleans
up
the
mice
but
she
kept
on
at
him
and
finally
he
said
all
right
she
could
have
one
then
by
george
she
says
ambersons
bought
their
dog
and
you
ca
get
one
without
paying
for
it
they
cost
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
dollars
up
old
aleck
wanted
to
know
if
i
ever
heard
of
anybody
buyin
a
dog
before
because
of
course
even
a
newfoundland
or
a
setter
you
can
usually
get
somebody
to
give
you
one
he
says
he
saw
some
sense
in
payin
a
nigger
a
dime
or
even
a
quarter
to
drown
a
dog
for
you
but
to
pay
out
fifty
dollars
and
maybe
more
well
sir
he
like
to
choked
himself
to
death
right
there
in
my
office
of
course
everybody
realizes
that
major
amberson
is
a
fine
business
man
but
what
with
throwin
money
around
for
dogs
and
every
which
and
what
some
think
all
this
style
bound
to
break
him
up
if
his
family
do
quit
one
citizen
having
thus
discoursed
to
a
visitor
came
to
a
thoughtful
pause
and
then
added
does
seem
pretty
much
like
squandering
yet
when
you
see
that
dog
out
walking
with
this
miss
isabel
he
seems
worth
the
what
she
look
like
well
sir
said
the
citizen
she
not
more
than
just
about
eighteen
or
maybe
nineteen
years
old
and
i
do
know
as
i
know
just
how
to
put
it
but
she
kind
of
a
delightful
lookin
young
lady
chapter
ii
another
citizen
said
an
eloquent
thing
about
miss
isabel
looks
this
was
henry
franklin
foster
the
foremost
literary
authority
and
intellectual
leader
of
the
community
both
the
daily
newspapers
thus
described
foster
when
she
founded
the
tennyson
club
and
her
word
upon
art
letters
and
the
drama
was
accepted
more
as
law
than
as
opinion
naturally
when
hazel
kirke
finally
reached
the
town
after
its
long
triumph
in
larger
places
many
people
waited
to
hear
what
henry
franklin
foster
thought
of
it
before
they
felt
warranted
in
expressing
any
estimate
of
the
play
in
fact
some
of
them
waited
in
the
lobby
of
the
theatre
as
they
came
out
and
formed
an
inquiring
group
about
her
i
did
see
the
play
she
informed
them
what
why
we
saw
you
right
in
the
middle
of
the
fourth
row
yes
she
said
smiling
but
i
was
sitting
just
behind
isabelle
amberson
i
could
look
at
anything
except
her
wavy
brown
hair
and
the
wonderful
back
of
her
the
ineligible
young
men
of
the
town
they
were
all
ineligible
were
unable
to
content
themselves
with
the
view
that
had
so
charmed
henry
franklin
foster
they
spent
their
time
struggling
to
keep
miss
amberson
face
turned
toward
them
she
turned
it
most
often
observers
said
toward
two
one
excelling
in
the
general
struggle
by
his
sparkle
and
the
other
by
that
winning
if
not
winsome
old
trait
persistence
the
sparkling
gentleman
led
germans
with
her
and
sent
sonnets
to
her
with
his
bouquets
sonnets
lacking
neither
music
nor
wit
he
was
generous
poor
and
his
amazing
persuasiveness
was
one
reason
why
he
was
always
in
debt
no
one
doubted
that
he
would
be
able
to
persuade
isabel
but
he
unfortunately
joined
too
merry
a
party
one
night
and
during
a
moonlight
serenade
upon
the
lawn
before
the
amberson
mansion
was
easily
identified
from
the
windows
as
the
person
who
stepped
through
the
bass
viol
and
had
to
be
assisted
to
a
waiting
carriage
one
of
miss
amberson
brothers
was
among
the
serenaders
and
when
the
party
had
dispersed
remained
propped
against
the
front
door
in
a
state
of
helpless
liveliness
the
major
going
down
in
a
and
slippers
to
bring
him
in
and
scolding
mildly
while
imperfectly
concealing
strong
impulses
to
laughter
miss
amberson
also
laughed
at
this
brother
the
next
day
but
for
the
suitor
it
was
a
different
matter
she
refused
to
see
him
when
he
called
to
apologize
you
seem
to
care
a
great
deal
about
bass
viols
he
wrote
her
i
promise
never
to
break
she
made
no
response
to
the
note
unless
it
was
an
answer
two
weeks
later
when
her
engagement
was
announced
she
took
the
persistent
one
wilbur
minafer
no
breaker
of
bass
viols
or
of
hearts
no
serenader
at
all
a
few
people
who
always
foresaw
everything
claimed
that
they
were
not
surprised
because
though
wilbur
minafer
might
not
be
an
apollo
as
it
were
he
was
a
steady
young
business
man
and
a
good
and
isabel
amberson
was
pretty
sensible
for
such
a
showy
but
the
engagement
astounded
the
young
people
and
most
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
too
and
as
a
topic
it
supplanted
literature
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
women
tennyson
wilbur
minafer
a
member
cried
her
inflection
seeming
to
imply
that
wilbur
crime
was
explained
by
his
surname
wilbur
minafer
it
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
heard
to
think
of
her
taking
wilbur
minafer
just
because
a
man
any
woman
would
like
a
thousand
times
better
was
a
little
wild
one
night
at
a
serenade
no
said
henry
franklin
foster
it
is
that
it
is
even
because
she
afraid
he
be
a
dissipated
husband
and
she
wants
to
be
safe
it
is
because
she
religious
or
hates
wildness
it
is
even
because
she
hates
wildness
in
well
but
look
how
she
thrown
him
over
for
no
that
was
her
reason
said
the
wise
henry
franklin
foster
if
men
only
knew
it
and
it
a
good
thing
they
do
a
woman
really
care
much
about
whether
a
man
wild
or
not
if
it
does
affect
herself
and
isabel
amberson
does
care
a
thing
mrs
foster
no
she
does
what
she
minds
is
his
making
a
clown
of
himself
in
her
front
yard
it
made
her
think
he
did
care
much
about
her
probably
mistaken
but
that
what
she
thinks
and
it
too
late
for
her
to
think
anything
else
now
because
she
going
to
be
married
right
away
the
invitations
will
be
out
next
week
it
be
a
big
thing
raw
oysters
floating
in
blocks
of
ice
and
a
band
from
champagne
showy
presents
a
colossal
present
from
the
major
then
wilbur
will
take
isabel
on
the
carefulest
little
wedding
trip
he
can
manage
and
she
be
a
good
wife
to
him
but
they
have
the
worst
spoiled
lot
of
children
this
town
will
ever
how
on
earth
do
you
make
that
out
foster
she
could
love
wilbur
could
she
foster
demanded
with
no
challengers
well
it
will
all
go
to
her
children
and
she
ruin
the
prophetess
proved
to
be
mistaken
in
a
single
detail
merely
except
for
that
her
foresight
was
accurate
the
wedding
was
of
ambersonian
magnificence
even
to
the
floating
oysters
and
the
major
colossal
present
was
a
set
of
architect
designs
for
a
house
almost
as
elaborate
and
impressive
as
the
mansion
the
house
to
be
built
in
amberson
addition
by
the
major
the
orchestra
was
certainly
not
that
local
one
which
had
suffered
the
loss
of
a
bass
viol
the
musicians
came
according
to
the
prophecy
and
next
morning
paper
from
afar
and
at
midnight
the
bride
was
still
being
toasted
in
champagne
though
she
had
departed
upon
her
wedding
journey
at
ten
four
days
later
the
pair
had
returned
to
town
which
promptness
seemed
fairly
to
demonstrate
that
wilbur
had
indeed
taken
isabel
upon
the
carefulest
little
trip
he
could
manage
according
to
every
report
she
was
from
the
start
a
good
wife
to
him
but
here
in
a
final
detail
the
prophecy
proved
inaccurate
wilbur
and
isabel
did
not
have
children
they
had
only
one
only
one
henry
franklin
foster
admitted
but
i
like
to
know
if
he
is
spoiled
enough
for
a
whole
carload
again
she
found
none
to
challenge
her
at
the
age
of
nine
george
amberson
minafer
the
major
one
grandchild
was
a
princely
terror
dreaded
not
only
in
amberson
addition
but
in
many
other
quarters
through
which
he
galloped
on
his
white
pony
by
golly
i
guess
you
think
you
own
this
town
an
embittered
labourer
complained
one
day
as
georgie
rode
the
pony
straight
through
a
pile
of
sand
the
man
was
sieving
i
will
when
i
grow
up
the
undisturbed
child
replied
i
guess
my
grandpa
owns
it
now
you
bet
and
the
baffled
workman
having
no
means
to
controvert
what
seemed
a
mere
exaggeration
of
the
facts
could
only
mutter
oh
pull
down
your
vest
do
haf
to
doctor
says
it
ai
healthy
the
boy
returned
promptly
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
pull
down
my
vest
if
you
wipe
off
your
chin
this
was
stock
and
stencil
the
accustomed
argot
of
street
badinage
of
the
period
and
in
such
matters
georgie
was
an
expert
he
had
no
vest
to
pull
down
the
incongruous
fact
was
that
a
fringed
sash
girdled
the
juncture
of
his
velvet
blouse
and
breeches
for
the
fauntleroy
period
had
set
in
and
georgie
mother
had
so
poor
an
eye
for
appropriate
things
where
georgie
was
concerned
that
she
dressed
him
according
to
the
doctrine
of
that
school
in
boy
decoration
not
only
did
he
wear
a
silk
sash
and
silk
stockings
and
a
broad
lace
collar
with
his
little
black
velvet
suit
he
had
long
brown
curls
and
often
came
home
with
burrs
in
them
except
upon
the
surface
which
was
not
his
own
work
but
his
mother
georgie
bore
no
vivid
resemblance
to
the
fabulous
little
cedric
the
storied
boy
famous
lean
on
me
grandfather
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
upon
the
lips
of
georgie
a
month
after
his
ninth
birthday
anniversary
when
the
major
gave
him
his
pony
he
had
already
become
acquainted
with
the
toughest
boys
in
various
distant
parts
of
the
town
and
had
convinced
them
that
the
toughness
of
a
rich
little
boy
with
long
curls
might
be
considered
in
many
respects
superior
to
their
own
he
fought
them
learning
how
to
go
berserk
at
a
certain
point
in
a
fight
bursting
into
tears
of
anger
reaching
for
rocks
uttering
wailed
threats
of
murder
and
attempting
to
fulfil
them
fights
often
led
to
intimacies
and
he
acquired
the
art
of
saying
things
more
exciting
than
do
haf
to
and
doctor
says
it
ai
healthy
thus
on
a
summer
afternoon
a
strange
boy
sitting
bored
upon
the
of
the
reverend
malloch
smith
beheld
george
amberson
minafer
rapidly
approaching
on
his
white
pony
and
was
impelled
by
bitterness
to
shout
shoot
the
ole
jackass
look
at
the
girly
curls
say
bub
where
you
steal
your
mother
ole
sash
your
sister
stole
it
for
me
georgie
instantly
replied
checking
the
pony
she
stole
it
off
our
an
gave
it
to
you
go
get
your
hair
cut
said
the
stranger
hotly
yah
i
have
got
any
sister
i
know
you
have
at
home
georgie
responded
i
mean
the
one
in
i
dare
you
to
get
down
off
that
pony
georgie
jumped
to
the
ground
and
the
other
boy
descended
from
the
reverend
smith
gatepost
but
he
descended
inside
the
gate
i
dare
you
outside
that
gate
said
georgie
yah
i
dare
you
half
way
here
i
dare
you
but
these
were
luckless
challenges
for
georgie
immediately
vaulted
the
fence
and
four
minutes
later
malloch
smith
hearing
strange
noises
looked
forth
from
a
window
then
screamed
and
dashed
for
the
pastor
study
malloch
smith
that
methodist
came
to
the
front
yard
and
found
his
visiting
nephew
being
rapidly
prepared
by
master
minafer
to
serve
as
a
principal
figure
in
a
pageant
of
massacre
it
was
with
great
physical
difficulty
that
smith
managed
to
give
his
nephew
a
chance
to
escape
into
the
house
for
georgie
was
hard
and
quick
and
in
such
matters
remarkably
intense
but
the
minister
after
a
grotesque
tussle
got
him
separated
from
his
opponent
and
shook
him
you
stop
that
you
georgie
cried
fiercely
and
wrenched
himself
away
i
guess
you
do
know
who
i
am
yes
i
do
know
the
angered
smith
retorted
i
know
who
you
are
and
you
a
disgrace
to
your
mother
your
mother
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
to
allow
shut
up
about
my
mother
bein
ashamed
of
herself
smith
exasperated
was
unable
to
close
the
dialogue
with
dignity
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
he
repeated
a
woman
that
lets
a
bad
boy
like
you
but
georgie
had
reached
his
pony
and
mounted
before
setting
off
at
his
accustomed
gallop
he
paused
to
interrupt
the
reverend
malloch
smith
again
you
pull
down
your
vest
you
ole
billygoat
you
he
shouted
distinctly
pull
down
your
vest
wipe
off
your
chin
an
go
to
hell
such
precocity
is
less
unusual
even
in
children
of
the
rich
than
most
grown
people
imagine
however
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
reverend
malloch
smith
and
left
him
in
a
state
of
excitement
he
at
once
wrote
a
note
to
georgie
mother
describing
the
crime
according
to
his
testimony
and
the
note
reached
minafer
before
georgie
did
when
he
got
home
she
read
it
to
him
sorrowfully
dear
madam
your
son
has
caused
a
painful
distress
in
my
household
he
made
an
unprovoked
attack
upon
a
little
nephew
of
mine
who
is
visiting
in
my
household
insulted
him
by
calling
him
vicious
names
and
falsehoods
stating
that
ladies
of
his
family
were
in
jail
he
then
tried
to
make
his
pony
kick
him
and
when
the
child
who
is
only
eleven
years
old
while
your
son
is
much
older
and
stronger
endeavoured
to
avoid
his
indignities
and
withdraw
quietly
he
pursued
him
into
the
enclosure
of
my
property
and
brutally
assaulted
him
when
i
appeared
upon
this
scene
he
deliberately
called
insulting
words
to
me
concluding
with
profanity
such
as
go
to
hell
which
was
heard
not
only
by
myself
but
by
my
wife
and
the
lady
who
lives
next
door
i
trust
such
a
state
of
undisciplined
behaviour
may
be
remedied
for
the
sake
of
the
reputation
for
propriety
if
nothing
higher
of
the
family
to
which
this
unruly
child
belongs
georgie
had
muttered
various
interruptions
and
as
she
concluded
the
reading
he
said
he
an
ole
liar
georgie
you
must
say
is
this
letter
the
truth
well
said
georgie
how
old
am
i
well
look
how
he
says
i
older
than
a
boy
eleven
years
that
true
said
isabel
he
does
but
is
some
of
it
true
georgie
georgie
felt
himself
to
be
in
a
difficulty
here
and
he
was
silent
georgie
did
you
say
what
he
says
you
did
which
one
did
you
tell
him
to
to
did
you
say
to
hell
georgie
looked
worried
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
brightened
listen
here
mamma
grandpa
would
wipe
his
shoe
on
that
ole
would
he
georgie
you
must
i
mean
none
of
the
ambersons
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
would
they
he
does
even
know
you
does
he
mamma
that
has
anything
to
do
with
yes
it
has
i
mean
none
of
the
amberson
family
go
to
see
him
and
they
never
have
him
come
in
their
house
they
would
ask
him
to
and
they
would
even
let
that
is
what
we
talking
i
bet
said
georgie
emphatically
i
bet
if
he
wanted
to
see
any
of
he
haf
to
go
around
to
the
side
door
no
dear
they
yes
they
would
mamma
so
what
does
it
matter
if
i
did
say
somep
to
him
he
did
like
that
kind
o
people
i
do
see
why
you
ca
say
anything
you
want
to
to
no
georgie
and
you
have
answered
me
whether
you
said
that
dreadful
thing
he
says
you
well
said
georgie
anyway
he
said
somep
to
me
that
made
me
and
upon
this
point
he
offered
no
further
details
he
would
not
explain
to
his
mother
that
what
had
made
him
mad
was
smith
hasty
condemnation
of
herself
your
mother
ought
to
be
ashamed
and
a
woman
that
lets
a
bad
boy
like
you
georgie
did
not
even
consider
excusing
himself
by
quoting
these
insolences
isabel
stroked
his
head
they
were
terrible
words
for
you
to
use
dear
from
his
letter
he
does
seem
a
very
tactful
person
but
he
just
riffraff
said
georgie
you
must
say
so
his
mother
gently
agreed
where
did
you
learn
those
bad
words
he
speaks
of
where
did
you
hear
any
one
use
them
well
i
heard
several
places
i
guess
uncle
george
amberson
was
the
first
i
ever
heard
say
uncle
george
amberson
said
to
papa
once
papa
did
like
it
but
uncle
george
was
just
laughin
at
papa
an
then
he
said
while
he
was
that
was
wrong
of
him
she
said
but
almost
instinctively
he
detected
the
lack
of
conviction
in
her
tone
it
was
isabel
great
failing
that
whatever
an
amberson
did
seemed
right
to
her
especially
if
the
amberson
was
either
her
brother
george
or
her
son
george
she
knew
that
she
should
be
more
severe
with
the
latter
now
but
severity
with
him
was
beyond
her
power
and
the
reverend
malloch
smith
had
succeeded
only
in
rousing
her
resentment
against
himself
georgie
symmetrical
face
altogether
an
amberson
face
had
looked
never
more
beautiful
to
her
it
always
looked
unusually
beautiful
when
she
tried
to
be
severe
with
him
you
must
promise
me
she
said
feebly
never
to
use
those
bad
words
i
promise
not
to
he
said
promptly
and
he
whispered
an
immediate
codicil
under
his
breath
unless
i
get
mad
at
somebody
this
satisfied
a
code
according
to
which
in
his
own
sincere
belief
he
never
told
lies
that
a
good
boy
she
said
and
he
ran
out
to
the
yard
his
punishment
over
some
admiring
friends
were
gathered
there
they
had
heard
of
his
adventure
knew
of
the
note
and
were
waiting
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
they
hoped
for
an
account
of
things
and
also
that
he
would
allow
them
to
take
turns
riding
his
pony
to
the
end
of
the
alley
and
back
they
were
really
his
henchmen
georgie
was
a
lord
among
boys
in
fact
he
was
a
personage
among
certain
sorts
of
grown
people
and
was
often
fawned
upon
the
alley
negroes
delighted
in
him
chuckled
over
him
flattered
him
slavishly
for
that
matter
he
often
heard
people
speaking
of
him
admiringly
a
group
of
ladies
once
gathered
about
him
on
the
pavement
where
he
was
spinning
a
top
i
know
this
is
georgie
one
exclaimed
and
turned
to
the
others
with
the
impressiveness
of
a
showman
major
amberson
only
grandchild
the
others
said
it
is
and
made
clicking
sounds
with
their
mouths
two
of
them
loudly
whispering
so
handsome
georgie
annoyed
because
they
kept
standing
upon
the
circle
he
had
chalked
for
his
top
looked
at
them
coldly
and
offered
a
suggestion
oh
go
hire
a
hall
as
an
amberson
he
was
already
a
public
character
and
the
story
of
his
adventure
in
the
reverend
malloch
smith
front
yard
became
a
town
topic
many
people
glanced
at
him
with
great
distaste
thereafter
when
they
chanced
to
encounter
him
which
meant
nothing
to
georgie
because
he
innocently
believed
most
grown
people
to
be
necessarily
as
a
normal
phenomenon
resulting
from
the
adult
state
and
he
failed
to
comprehend
that
the
distasteful
glances
had
any
personal
bearing
upon
himself
if
he
had
perceived
such
a
bearing
he
would
have
been
affected
only
so
far
probably
as
to
mutter
riffraff
possibly
he
would
have
shouted
it
and
certainly
most
people
believed
a
story
that
went
round
the
town
just
after
amberson
funeral
when
georgie
was
eleven
georgie
was
reported
to
have
differed
with
the
undertaker
about
the
seating
of
the
family
his
indignant
voice
had
become
audible
well
who
is
the
most
important
person
at
my
own
grandmother
funeral
and
later
he
had
projected
his
head
from
the
window
of
the
foremost
mourners
carriage
as
the
undertaker
happened
to
pass
riffraff
there
were
people
grown
people
they
were
who
expressed
themselves
longingly
they
did
hope
to
live
to
see
the
day
they
said
when
that
boy
would
get
his
they
used
that
honest
word
so
much
better
than
deserts
and
not
until
many
years
later
to
be
more
clumsily
rendered
as
what
is
coming
to
something
was
bound
to
take
him
down
some
day
and
they
only
wanted
to
be
there
but
georgie
heard
nothing
of
this
and
the
yearners
for
his
taking
down
went
unsatisfied
while
their
yearning
grew
the
greater
as
the
happy
day
of
fulfilment
was
longer
and
longer
postponed
his
grandeur
was
not
diminished
by
the
malloch
smith
story
the
rather
it
was
increased
and
among
other
children
especially
among
little
girls
there
was
added
to
the
prestige
of
his
gilded
position
that
diabolical
glamour
which
must
inevitably
attend
a
boy
who
has
told
a
minister
to
go
to
hell
chapter
iii
until
he
reached
the
age
of
twelve
georgie
education
was
a
domestic
process
tutors
came
to
the
house
and
those
citizens
who
yearned
for
his
taking
down
often
said
just
wait
till
he
has
to
go
to
public
school
then
he
get
it
but
at
twelve
georgie
was
sent
to
a
private
school
in
the
town
and
there
came
from
this
small
and
dependent
institution
no
report
or
even
rumour
of
georgie
getting
anything
that
he
was
thought
to
deserve
therefore
the
yearning
still
persisted
though
growing
gaunt
with
feeding
upon
itself
for
although
pomposities
and
impudence
in
the
little
school
were
often
almost
unbearable
the
teachers
were
fascinated
by
him
they
did
not
like
him
he
was
too
arrogant
for
that
but
he
kept
them
in
such
a
state
of
emotion
that
they
thought
more
about
him
than
they
did
about
all
of
the
other
ten
pupils
the
emotion
he
kept
them
in
was
usually
one
resulting
from
injured
but
sometimes
it
was
dazzled
admiration
so
far
as
their
conscientious
observation
went
he
studied
his
lessons
sparingly
but
sometimes
in
class
he
flashed
an
admirable
answer
with
a
comprehension
not
often
shown
by
the
pupils
they
taught
and
he
passed
his
examinations
easily
in
all
without
discernible
effort
he
acquired
at
this
school
some
rudiments
of
a
liberal
education
and
learned
nothing
whatever
about
himself
the
yearners
were
still
yearning
when
georgie
at
sixteen
was
sent
away
to
a
great
prep
now
they
said
brightly
he
get
it
he
find
himself
among
boys
just
as
important
in
their
home
towns
as
he
is
and
they
knock
the
stuffing
out
of
him
when
he
puts
on
his
airs
with
them
oh
but
that
would
be
worth
something
to
see
they
were
mistaken
it
appeared
for
when
georgie
returned
a
few
months
later
he
still
seemed
to
have
the
same
stuffing
he
had
been
deported
by
the
authorities
the
offense
being
stated
as
insolence
and
profanity
in
fact
he
had
given
the
principal
of
the
school
instructions
almost
identical
with
those
formerly
objected
to
by
the
reverend
malloch
smith
but
he
had
not
got
his
and
those
who
counted
upon
it
were
embittered
by
his
appearance
upon
the
streets
driving
a
at
criminal
speed
making
pedestrians
retreat
from
the
crossings
and
behaving
generally
as
if
he
owned
the
a
disgusted
hardware
dealer
of
middle
age
one
of
those
who
hungered
for
georgie
downfall
was
thus
driven
back
upon
the
sidewalk
to
avoid
being
run
over
and
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
make
use
of
the
pet
street
insult
of
the
year
got
sense
see
here
bub
does
your
mother
know
you
out
georgie
without
even
seeming
to
look
at
him
flicked
the
long
lash
of
his
whip
dexterously
and
a
little
spurt
of
dust
came
from
the
hardware
man
trousers
not
far
below
the
waist
he
was
not
made
of
hardware
he
raved
looking
for
a
missile
then
finding
none
commanded
himself
sufficiently
to
shout
after
the
rapid
turn
down
your
pants
you
dude
raining
in
dear
ole
lunnon
git
off
the
earth
georgie
gave
him
no
encouragement
to
think
that
he
was
heard
the
turned
the
next
corner
causing
indignation
there
likewise
and
having
proceeded
some
distance
farther
halted
in
front
of
the
amberson
block
an
brick
warren
of
lawyers
offices
insurance
and
realestate
offices
with
a
drygoods
store
occupying
the
ground
floor
georgie
tied
his
lathered
trotter
to
a
telegraph
pole
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
building
critically
it
seemed
shabby
and
he
thought
his
grandfather
ought
to
replace
it
with
a
skyscraper
or
even
a
higher
one
such
as
he
had
lately
seen
in
new
york
when
he
stopped
there
for
a
few
days
of
recreation
and
rest
on
his
way
home
from
the
bereaved
school
about
the
entryway
to
the
stairs
were
various
tin
signs
announcing
the
occupation
and
location
of
tenants
and
georgie
decided
to
take
some
of
these
with
him
if
he
should
ever
go
to
college
however
he
did
not
stop
to
collect
them
at
this
time
but
climbed
the
worn
stairs
there
was
no
elevator
to
the
fourth
floor
went
down
a
dark
corridor
and
rapped
three
times
upon
a
door
it
was
a
mysterious
door
its
upper
half
of
opaque
glass
bearing
no
sign
to
state
the
business
or
profession
of
the
occupants
within
but
overhead
upon
the
lintel
four
letters
had
been
smearingly
inscribed
partly
with
purple
ink
and
partly
with
a
soft
lead
pencil
f
and
upon
the
plaster
wall
above
the
lintel
there
was
a
drawing
dear
to
male
adolescence
a
skull
and
crossbones
three
raps
similar
to
georgie
sounded
from
within
the
room
georgie
then
rapped
four
times
the
rapper
within
the
room
rapped
twice
and
georgie
rapped
seven
times
this
ended
precautionary
measures
and
a
boy
of
sixteen
opened
the
door
whereupon
georgie
entered
quickly
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
seven
boys
of
congenial
age
were
seated
in
a
semicircular
row
of
damaged
office
chairs
facing
a
platform
whereon
stood
a
solemn
young
personage
with
a
table
before
him
at
one
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
battered
sideboard
and
upon
it
were
some
empty
beer
bottles
a
tobacco
can
about
full
with
a
web
of
mold
over
the
surface
of
the
tobacco
a
dusty
cabinet
photograph
not
inscribed
of
miss
lillian
russell
several
withered
old
pickles
a
caseknife
and
a
section
of
on
a
sooty
plate
at
the
other
end
of

said
the
presiding
officer

georgie
was
disposed
to
be
informal
he
interrupted
turning
to
the
boy
who
had
admitted

charlie
johnson
uneasily

i
did
have
much
to
do
with
it
some
of
the
other
members
thought
that
long
as
you
in
town
or
anything
and
fred
gave
the
sideboard
why
kinney
presiding
held
in
his
hand
in
lieu
of
a
gavel
and
considered
much
more
impressive
a
civil
war
relic
known
as

rapped
loudly
for
order

said
sharply

because

to
hold
a
meeting

said
george
skeptically
charlie
johnson
thought
to
mollify
him
well
did
we
call
this
meeting
just
especially
because
you
told
us
to
you
said
yourself
we
ought
to
have
a
kind
of
celebration
because
you
got
back
to
town
george
and
that
what
we
here
for
now
and
everything
what
do
you
care
about
being
president
all
it
amounts
to
is
just
calling
the
roll
and
the
president
de
facto
hammered
the
table
this
meeting
will
now
proceed
to
no

wo
said
george
and
he
advanced
to
the
desk
laughing
contemptuously
get
off
that
this
meeting
will
come
to
order
kinney
commanded
fiercely
you
put
down
that
gavel
said
george
whose
is
it
i
like
to
know
it
belongs
to
my
grandfather
and
you
quit
hammering
it
that
way
or
you
break
it
and
i
have
to
knock
your
head
this
meeting
will
come
to
order
i
was
legally
elected

not
going
to

said
georgie

shouted
we

and
then
we
play
euchre

a
corner
what

for
this
meeting
will
now
come
to
ord
georgie
addressed
the
members
i
like
to
know
who
got
up
this
thing
in
the
first
place
he
said
who
the
founder
of
the
if
you
please
who
got
this
room
rent
free
who
got
the
janitor
to
let
us
have
most
of
this
furniture
you
suppose
you
could
keep
this
clubroom
a
minute
if
i
told
my
grandfather
i
did
want
it
for
a
literary
club
any
more
i
like
to
say
a
word
on
how
you
members
been
acting
too
when
i
went
away
i
said
i
did
care
if
you
had
a
or
something
while
i
was
gone
but
here
i
hardly
turned
my
back
and
you
had
to
go
and
elect
fred
kinney
president
well
if
that
what
you
want
you
can
have
it
i
was
going
to
have
a
little
celebration
down
here
some
night
pretty
soon
and
bring
some
port
wine
like
we
drink
at
school
in
our
crowd
there
and
i
was
going
to
get
my
grandfather
to
give
the
club
an
extra
room
across
the
hall
and
i
could
get
my
uncle
george
to
give
us
his
old
billiard
table
because
he
got
a
new
one
and
the
club
could
put
it
in
the
other
room
well
you
got
a
new
president
now
here
georgie
moved
toward
the
door
and
his
tone
became
plaintive
though
undeniably
there
was
disdain
beneath
his
sorrow
i
guess
all
i
better
do
is
resign
and
he
opened
the
door
apparently
intending
to
withdraw
all
in
favour
of
having
a
new
election
charlie
johnson
shouted
hastily
say
aye
was
said
by
everyone
present
except
kinney
who
began
a
hot
protest
but
it
was
immediately
smothered
all
in
favour
of
me
being
president
instead
of
fred
kinney
shouted
georgie
say
the
have
it
i
resign
said
the
boy
gulping
as
he
descended
from
the
platform
i
resign
from
the
club
he
found
his
hat
and
departed
jeers
echoing
after
him
as
he
plunged
down
the
corridor
georgie
stepped
upon
the
platform
and
took
up
the
emblem
of
office
ole
fred
be
around
next
week
said
the
new
chairman
he
be
around
to
get
us
to
take
him
back
in
again
but
i
guess
we
do
want
him
that
fellow
always
was
a
we
will
now
proceed
with
our
meeting
well
fellows
i
suppose
you
want
to
hear
from
your
president
i
do
know
that
i
have
much
to
say
as
i
have
already
seen
most
of
you
a
few
times
since
i
got
back
i
had
a
good
time
at
the
old
school
back
east
but
had
a
little
trouble
with
the
faculty
and
came
on
home
my
family
stood
by
me
as
well
as
i
could
ask
and
i
expect
to
stay
right
here
in
the
old
town
until
whenever
i
decide
to
enter
college
now
i
do
suppose
there
any
more
business
before
the
meeting
i
guess
we
might
as
well
play
cards
anybody
that
game
for
a
little
poker
or
any
limit
they
say
why
i
like
to
have
sit
at
the
president
when
the
diversions
of
the
friends
of
the
ace
were
concluded
for
that
afternoon
georgie
invited
his
chief
supporter
charlie
johnson
to
drive
home
with
him
to
dinner
and
as
they
jingled
up
national
avenue
in
the
charlie
asked
what
sort
of
men
did
you
run
up
against
at
that
school
george
best
crowd
there
finest
set
of
men
i
ever
how
you
get
in
with
georgie
laughed
i
let
them
get
in
with
me
charlie
he
said
in
a
tone
of
gentle
explanation
it
vulgar
to
do
any
other
way
did
i
tell
you
the
nickname
they
gave
me
that
was
what
they
called
me
at
that
school
how
they
happen
to
do
that
his
friend
asked
innocently
oh
different
things
george
answered
lightly
of
course
any
of
that
came
from
anywhere
out
in
this
part
the
country
knew
about
the
family
and
all
that
and
so
i
suppose
it
was
a
good
deal
on
account
of
oh
on
account
of
the
family
and
the
way
i
do
things
most
chapter
iv
when
george
amberson
minafer
came
home
for
the
holidays
at
christmastide
in
his
sophomore
year
probably
no
great
change
had
taken
place
inside
him
but
his
exterior
was
visibly
altered
nothing
about
him
encouraged
any
hope
that
he
had
received
his
on
the
contrary
the
yearners
for
that
stroke
of
justice
must
yearn
even
more
itchingly
the
gilded
youth
manner
had
become
polite
but
his
politeness
was
of
a
kind
which
democratic
people
found
hard
to
bear
in
a
word
le
due
had
returned
from
the
gay
life
of
the
capital
to
show
himself
for
a
week
among
the
loyal
peasants
belonging
to
the
old
chateau
and
their
quaint
habits
and
costumes
afforded
him
a
mild
amusement
cards
were
out
for
a
ball
in
his
honour
and
this
pageant
of
the
tenantry
was
held
in
the
ballroom
of
the
amberson
mansion
the
night
after
his
arrival
it
was
as
henry
franklin
foster
said
of
isabel
wedding
a
big
thing
though
that
wise
henry
franklin
foster
had
long
ago
gone
the
way
of
all
wisdom
having
stepped
out
of
the
midland
town
unquestionably
into
heaven
a
long
step
but
not
beyond
her
powers
she
had
successors
but
no
successor
the
town
having
grown
too
large
to
confess
that
it
was
intellectually
led
and
literarily
authoritated
by
one
person
and
some
of
these
successors
were
not
invited
to
the
ball
for
dimensions
were
now
so
metropolitan
that
intellectual
leaders
and
literary
authorities
loomed
in
outlying
regions
unfamiliar
to
the
ambersons
however
all
old
citizens
recognizable
as
gentry
received
cards
and
of
course
so
did
their
dancing
descendants
the
orchestra
and
the
caterer
were
brought
from
away
in
the
amberson
manner
though
this
was
really
a
gesture
perhaps
one
more
of
habit
than
of
ostentation
for
servitors
of
gaiety
as
proficient
as
these
importations
were
nowadays
to
be
found
in
the
town
even
flowers
and
plants
and
roped
vines
were
brought
from
afar
not
however
until
the
stock
of
the
local
florists
proved
insufficient
to
obliterate
the
interior
structure
of
the
big
house
in
the
amberson
way
it
was
the
last
of
the
great
long
remembered
dances
that
everybody
talked
about
there
were
getting
to
be
so
many
people
in
town
that
no
later
than
the
next
year
there
were
too
many
for
everybody
to
hear
of
even
such
a
ball
as
the
ambersons
george
with
a
gardenia
in
his
buttonhole
stood
with
his
mother
and
the
major
embowered
in
the
big
red
and
gold
drawing
room
downstairs
to
receive
the
guests
and
standing
thus
together
the
trio
offered
a
picturesque
example
of
good
looks
persistent
through
three
generations
the
major
his
daughter
and
his
grandson
were
of
a
type
all
amberson
tall
straight
and
regular
with
dark
eyes
short
noses
good
chins
and
the
grandfather
expression
no
less
than
the
grandson
was
one
of
faintly
amused
condescension
there
was
a
difference
however
the
grandson
unlined
young
face
had
nothing
to
offer
except
this
condescension
the
grandfather
had
other
things
to
say
it
was
a
handsome
worldly
old
face
conscious
of
its
importance
but
persuasive
rather
than
arrogant
and
not
without
tokens
of
sufferings
withstood
the
major
short
white
hair
was
parted
in
the
middle
like
his
grandson
and
in
all
he
stood
as
briskly
equipped
to
the
fashion
as
exquisite
young
george
isabel
standing
between
her
father
and
her
son
caused
a
vague
amazement
in
the
mind
of
the
latter
her
age
just
under
forty
was
for
george
a
thought
of
something
as
remote
as
the
moons
of
jupiter
he
could
not
possibly
have
conceived
such
an
age
ever
coming
to
be
his
own
five
years
was
the
limit
of
his
thinking
in
time
five
years
ago
he
had
been
a
child
not
yet
fourteen
and
those
five
years
were
an
abyss
five
years
hence
he
would
be
almost
what
the
girls
he
knew
called
one
of
the
older
he
could
imagine
himself
at
but
beyond
that
his
powers
staggered
and
refused
the
task
he
saw
little
essential
difference
between
and
and
his
mother
was
to
him
not
a
woman
but
wholly
a
mother
he
had
no
perception
of
her
other
than
as
an
adjunct
to
himself
his
mother
nor
could
he
imagine
her
thinking
or
doing
anything
falling
in
love
walking
with
a
friend
or
reading
a
book
as
a
woman
and
not
as
his
mother
the
woman
isabel
was
a
stranger
to
her
son
as
completely
a
stranger
as
if
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
her
or
heard
her
voice
and
it
was
while
he
stood
with
her
receiving
that
he
caught
a
disquieting
glimpse
of
this
stranger
whom
he
thus
fleetingly
encountered
for
the
first
time
youth
can
not
imagine
romance
apart
from
youth
that
is
why
the
roles
of
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
plays
are
given
by
the
managers
to
the
most
youthful
actors
they
can
find
among
the
competent
both
people
and
young
people
enjoy
a
play
about
young
lovers
but
only
people
will
tolerate
a
play
about
lovers
young
people
will
not
come
to
see
such
a
play
because
for
them
lovers
are
a
joke
not
a
very
funny
one
therefore
to
bring
both
the
people
and
the
young
people
into
his
house
the
manager
makes
his
romance
as
young
as
he
can
youth
will
indeed
be
served
and
its
profound
instinct
is
to
be
not
only
scornfully
amused
but
vaguely
angered
by
romance
so
standing
beside
his
mother
george
was
disturbed
by
a
sudden
impression
coming
upon
him
out
of
nowhere
so
far
as
he
could
detect
that
her
eyes
were
brilliant
that
she
was
graceful
and
youthful
in
a
word
that
she
was
romantically
lovely
he
had
one
of
those
curious
moments
that
seem
to
have
neither
a
cause
nor
any
connection
with
actual
things
while
it
lasted
he
was
disquieted
not
by
thoughts
for
he
had
no
definite
thoughts
but
by
a
slight
emotion
like
that
caused
in
a
dream
by
the
presence
of
something
invisible
soundless
and
yet
fantastic
there
was
nothing
different
or
new
about
his
mother
except
her
new
black
and
silver
dress
she
was
standing
there
beside
him
bending
her
head
a
little
in
her
greetings
smiling
the
same
smile
she
had
worn
for
the
that
people
had
been
passing
the
receiving
group
her
face
was
flushed
but
the
room
was
warm
and
shaking
hands
with
so
many
people
easily
accounted
for
the
pretty
glow
that
was
upon
her
at
any
time
she
could
have
passed
for
or
a
man
of
fifty
would
have
honestly
guessed
her
to
be
about
thirty
but
possibly
two
or
three
years
younger
and
though
extraordinary
in
this
she
had
been
extraordinary
in
it
for
years
there
was
nothing
in
either
her
looks
or
her
manner
to
explain
george
uncomfortable
feeling
and
yet
it
increased
becoming
suddenly
a
vague
resentment
as
if
she
had
done
something
unmotherly
to
him
the
fantastic
moment
passed
and
even
while
it
lasted
he
was
doing
his
duty
greeting
two
pretty
girls
with
whom
he
had
grown
up
as
people
say
and
warmly
assuring
them
that
he
remembered
them
very
well
an
assurance
which
might
have
surprised
them
in
anybody
but
georgie
minafer
it
seemed
unnecessary
since
he
had
spent
many
hours
with
them
no
longer
ago
than
the
preceding
august
they
had
with
them
their
parents
and
an
uncle
from
out
of
town
and
george
negligently
gave
the
parents
the
same
assurance
he
had
given
the
daughters
but
murmured
another
form
of
greeting
to
the
uncle
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
this
person
george
absently
took
note
of
as
a
undergraduates
had
not
yet
adopted
it
was
a
period
previous
to
that
in
which
a
sophomore
would
have
thought
of
the
sharon
girls
uncle
as
a
bird
or
perhaps
a
in
george
time
every
human
male
was
to
be
defined
at
pleasure
as
a
duck
but
duck
was
not
spoken
with
admiring
affection
as
in
its
former
feminine
use
to
signify
a
dear
on
the
contrary
duck
implied
the
speaker
personal
detachment
and
humorous
superiority
an
indifferent
amusement
was
what
george
felt
when
his
mother
with
a
gentle
emphasis
interrupted
his
interchange
of
courtesies
with
the
nieces
to
present
him
to
the
duck
their
uncle
this
emphasis
of
isabel
though
slight
enabled
george
to
perceive
that
she
considered
the
duck
a
person
of
some
importance
but
it
was
far
from
enabling
him
to
understand
why
the
duck
parted
his
thick
and
longish
black
hair
on
the
side
his
tie
was
a
forgetful
looking
thing
and
his
coat
though
it
fitted
a
good
enough
figure
no
product
of
this
year
or
of
last
year
either
one
of
his
eyebrows
was
noticeably
higher
than
the
other
and
there
were
whimsical
lines
between
them
which
gave
him
an
apprehensive
expression
but
his
apprehensions
were
evidently
more
humorous
than
profound
for
his
prevailing
look
was
that
of
a
genial
man
of
affairs
not
much
afraid
of
anything
whatever
nevertheless
observing
only
his
unfashionable
hair
his
eyebrows
his
preoccupied
tie
and
his
old
coat
the
olympic
george
set
him
down
as
a
duck
and
having
thus
completed
his
portrait
took
no
interest
in
him
the
sharon
girls
passed
on
taking
the
duck
with
them
and
george
became
pink
with
mortification
as
his
mother
called
his
attention
to
a
guest
waiting
to
shake
his
hand
this
was
old
john
minafer
it
was
old
john
boast
that
in
spite
of
his
connection
by
marriage
with
the
ambersons
he
never
had
worn
and
never
would
wear
a
coat
members
of
his
family
had
exerted
their
influence
uselessly
at
conservative
people
seldom
form
radical
new
habits
and
old
john
wore
his
sunday
suit
of
black
broadcloth
to
the
amberson
ball
the
coat
was
square
with
skirts
to
the
knees
old
john
called
it
a
prince
albert
and
was
well
enough
pleased
with
it
but
his
considered
it
the
next
thing
to
an
insult
george
purpose
had
been
to
ignore
the
man
but
he
had
to
take
his
hand
for
a
moment
whereupon
old
john
began
to
tell
george
that
he
was
looking
well
though
there
had
been
a
time
during
his
fourth
month
when
he
was
so
puny
that
nobody
thought
he
would
live
the
in
a
fury
of
blushes
dropped
old
john
hand
with
some
vigour
and
seized
that
of
the
next
person
in
the
line
member
you
well
he
said
fiercely
the
large
room
had
filled
and
so
had
the
broad
hall
and
the
rooms
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
where
there
were
tables
for
whist
the
imported
orchestra
waited
in
the
ballroom
on
the
third
floor
but
a
local
harp
violin
and
flute
were
playing
airs
from
the
fencing
master
in
the
hall
and
people
were
shouting
over
the
music
old
john
minafer
voice
was
louder
and
more
penetrating
than
any
other
because
he
had
been
troubled
with
deafness
for
years
heard
his
own
voice
but
faintly
and
liked
to
hear
it
smell
o
flowers
like
this
always
puts
me
in
mind
o
funerals
he
kept
telling
his
niece
fanny
minafer
who
was
with
him
and
he
seemed
to
get
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
out
of
this
reminder
his
tremulous
yet
strident
voice
cut
through
the
voluminous
sound
that
filled
the
room
and
he
was
heard
everywhere
always
got
to
think
o
funerals
when
i
smell
so
many
flowers
and
as
the
pressure
of
people
forced
fanny
and
himself
against
the
white
marble
mantelpiece
he
pursued
this
train
of
cheery
thought
shouting
right
here
where
the
major
wife
was
laid
out
at
her
funeral
they
had
her
in
a
good
light
from
that
big
bow
he
paused
to
chuckle
mournfully
i
that
where
they
put
the
major
when
his
time
presently
george
mortification
was
increased
to
hear
this
sawmill
droning
harshly
from
the
midst
of
the
thickening
crowd
ai
the
dancin
broke
out
yet
fanny
hoopla
le
push
through
and
go
see
the
young
crack
their
heels
start
the
circus
miss
fanny
minafer
in
charge
of
the
lively
veteran
was
almost
as
distressed
as
her
nephew
george
but
she
did
her
duty
and
managed
to
get
old
john
through
the
press
and
out
to
the
broad
stairway
which
numbers
of
young
people
were
now
ascending
to
the
ballroom
and
here
the
sawmill
voice
still
rose
over
all
others
solid
black
walnut
every
inch
of
it
balustrades
and
all
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
o
carved
woodwork
in
the
house
like
water
spent
money
like
water
always
did
still
do
like
water
god
knows
where
it
all
comes
from
he
continued
the
ascent
barking
and
coughing
among
the
gleaming
young
heads
white
shoulders
jewels
and
chiffon
like
an
old
dog
slowly
swimming
up
the
rapids
of
a
sparkling
river
while
down
below
in
the
drawing
room
george
began
to
recover
from
the
degradation
into
which
this
relic
of
early
settler
days
had
dragged
him
what
restored
him
completely
was
a
little
beauty
of
nineteen
very
knowing
in
lustrous
blue
and
jet
at
sight
of
this
dashing
advent
in
the
line
of
guests
before
him
george
was
fully
an
amberson
again
remember
you
very
well
indeed
he
said
his
graciousness
more
earnest
than
any
he
had
heretofore
displayed
isabel
heard
him
and
laughed
but
you
do
george
she
said
you
do
remember
her
yet
though
of
course
you
will
miss
morgan
is
from
out
of
town
and
i
afraid
this
is
the
first
time
you
ever
seen
her
you
might
take
her
up
to
the
dancing
i
think
you
pretty
well
done
your
duty
be
george
responded
formally
and
offered
his
arm
not
with
a
flourish
certainly
but
with
an
impressiveness
inspired
partly
by
the
appearance
of
the
person
to
whom
he
offered
it
partly
by
his
being
the
hero
of
this
fete
and
partly
by
his
youthfulness
for
when
manners
are
new
they
are
apt
to
be
elaborate
the
little
beauty
entrusted
her
gloved
fingers
to
his
and
they
moved
away
together
their
progress
was
necessarily
slow
and
to
george
mind
it
did
not
lack
stateliness
how
could
it
musicians
hired
especially
for
him
were
sitting
in
a
grove
of
palms
in
the
hall
and
now
tenderly
playing
oh
promise
me
for
his
pleasuring
dozens
and
scores
of
flowers
had
been
brought
to
life
and
tended
to
this
hour
that
they
might
sweeten
the
air
for
him
while
they
died
and
the
evanescent
power
that
music
and
floral
scents
hold
over
youth
stirred
his
appreciation
of
strange
beautiful
qualities
within
his
own
bosom
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
mysteriously
angelic
and
about
to
do
something
which
would
overwhelm
the
beautiful
young
stranger
upon
his
arm
elderly
people
and
people
moved
away
to
let
him
pass
with
his
honoured
fair
beside
him
worthy
creatures
they
seemed
leading
dull
lives
but
appreciative
of
better
things
when
they
saw
them
and
george
bosom
was
fleetingly
touched
with
a
pitying
kindness
and
since
the
primordial
day
when
caste
or
heritage
first
set
one
person
in
his
own
esteem
above
his
it
is
to
be
doubted
if
anybody
ever
felt
more
illustrious
or
more
negligently
grand
than
george
amberson
minafer
felt
at
this
party
as
he
conducted
miss
morgan
through
the
hall
toward
the
stairway
they
passed
the
open
double
doors
of
a
card
room
where
some
squadrons
of
older
people
were
preparing
for
action
and
leaning
gracefully
upon
the
mantelpiece
of
this
room
a
tall
man
handsome
and
sparklingly
held
laughing
converse
with
that
duck
the
sharon
girls
uncle
the
tall
gentleman
waved
a
gracious
salutation
to
george
and
miss
morgan
curiosity
was
stirred
who
is
that
i
did
catch
his
name
when
my
mother
presented
him
to
me
said
george
you
mean
the
i
mean
the
aristocratic
that
my
uncle
george
honourable
george
amberson
i
thought
everybody
knew
he
looks
as
though
everybody
ought
to
know
him
she
said
it
seems
to
run
in
your
if
she
had
any
sly
intention
it
skipped
over
george
harmlessly
well
of
course
i
suppose
most
everybody
does
he
admitted
out
in
this
part
of
the
country
especially
besides
uncle
george
is
in
congress
the
family
like
to
have
someone
why
well
it
sort
of
a
good
thing
in
one
way
for
instance
my
uncle
sydney
amberson
and
his
wife
aunt
amelia
they
have
got
much
of
anything
to
do
with
themselves
get
bored
to
death
around
here
of
course
well
probably
uncle
george
have
uncle
sydney
appointed
minister
or
ambassador
or
something
like
that
to
russia
or
italy
or
somewhere
and
that
make
it
pleasant
when
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
go
travelling
or
things
like
that
i
expect
to
do
a
good
deal
of
travelling
myself
when
i
get
out
of
on
the
stairway
he
pointed
out
this
prospective
ambassadorial
couple
sydney
and
amelia
they
were
coming
down
fronting
the
ascending
tide
and
as
conspicuous
over
it
as
a
king
and
queen
in
a
play
moreover
as
the
miss
morgan
remarked
the
very
least
they
looked
was
ambassadorial
sydney
was
an
amberson
exaggerated
more
pompous
than
gracious
too
portly
flushed
starched
to
a
shine
his
stately
jowl
furnished
with
an
edward
the
seventh
beard
amelia
likewise
showed
glittering
blond
hair
exuberantly
dressed
a
pink
fat
face
cold
under
a
tiara
a
solid
cold
bosom
under
a
necklace
great
cold
gloved
arms
and
the
rest
of
her
beautifully
upholstered
amelia
was
an
amberson
born
herself
they
had
no
children
and
sydney
was
without
a
business
or
a
profession
thus
both
found
a
great
deal
of
time
to
think
about
the
appropriateness
of
their
becoming
excellencies
and
as
george
ascended
the
broad
stairway
they
were
precisely
the
aunt
and
uncle
he
was
most
pleased
to
point
out
to
a
girl
from
out
of
town
as
his
appurtenances
in
the
way
of
relatives
at
sight
of
them
the
grandeur
of
the
amberson
family
was
instantly
conspicuous
as
a
permanent
thing
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
the
ambersons
were
entrenched
in
their
nobility
and
riches
behind
polished
and
glittering
barriers
which
were
as
solid
as
they
were
brilliant
and
would
last
chapter
v
the
hero
of
the
fete
with
the
little
beauty
upon
his
arm
reached
the
top
of
the
second
flight
of
stairs
and
here
beyond
a
spacious
landing
where
two
darkies
tended
a
crystalline
punch
bowl
four
wide
archways
in
a
lattice
framed
gliding
silhouettes
of
waltzers
already
smoothly
at
it
to
the
castanets
of
la
old
john
minafer
evidently
surfeited
was
in
the
act
of
leaving
these
delights
more
o
that
he
barked
just
slidin
around
call
that
dancin
rather
see
a
jig
any
day
in
the
world
they
ai
very
modest
some
of
i
do
mind
that
though
not
me
miss
fanny
minafer
was
no
longer
in
charge
of
him
he
emerged
from
the
ballroom
escorted
by
a
man
of
commonplace
appearance
the
escort
had
a
dry
lined
face
upon
which
not
ornamentally
but
as
a
matter
of
course
there
grew
a
business
man
short
moustache
and
his
thin
neck
showed
an
adam
apple
but
not
conspicuously
for
there
was
nothing
conspicuous
about
him
baldish
dim
quiet
he
was
an
unnoticeable
part
of
this
festival
and
although
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
men
present
not
casually
to
be
distinguished
from
him
in
general
aspect
he
was
probably
the
last
person
in
the
big
house
at
whom
a
stranger
would
have
glanced
twice
it
did
not
enter
george
mind
to
mention
to
miss
morgan
that
this
was
his
father
or
to
say
anything
whatever
about
him
minafer
shook
his
son
hand
unobtrusively
in
passing
i
take
uncle
john
home
he
said
in
a
low
voice
then
i
guess
i
go
on
home
myself
i
not
a
great
hand
at
parties
you
know
george
murmured
a
friendly
enough
without
pausing
ordinarily
he
was
not
ashamed
of
the
minafers
he
seldom
thought
about
them
at
all
for
he
belonged
as
most
american
children
do
to
the
family
but
he
was
anxious
not
to
linger
with
miss
morgan
in
the
vicinity
of
old
john
whom
he
felt
to
be
a
disgrace
he
pushed
brusquely
through
the
fringe
of
calculating
youths
who
were
gathered
in
the
arches
watching
for
chances
to
dance
only
with
girls
who
would
soon
be
taken
off
their
hands
and
led
his
stranger
lady
out
upon
the
floor
they
caught
the
time
instantly
and
were
away
in
the
waltz
george
danced
well
and
miss
morgan
seemed
to
float
as
part
of
the
music
the
very
dove
itself
of
la
they
said
nothing
as
they
danced
her
eyes
were
cast
down
all
the
while
the
prettiest
gesture
for
a
dancer
and
there
was
left
in
the
universe
for
each
of
them
only
their
companionship
in
this
waltz
while
the
faces
of
the
other
dancers
swimming
by
denoted
not
people
but
merely
blurs
of
colour
george
became
conscious
of
strange
feelings
within
him
an
exaltation
of
soul
tender
but
indefinite
and
seemingly
located
in
the
upper
part
of
his
diaphragm
the
stopping
of
the
music
came
upon
him
like
the
waking
to
an
alarm
clock
for
instantly
six
or
seven
of
the
calculating
persons
about
the
bore
down
upon
miss
morgan
to
secure
dances
george
had
to
do
with
one
already
established
as
a
belle
it
seemed
give
me
the
next
and
the
one
after
that
he
said
hurriedly
recovering
some
presence
of
mind
just
as
the
nearest
applicant
reached
them
and
give
me
every
third
one
the
rest
of
the
she
laughed
are
you
asking
what
do
you
mean
it
sounded
as
though
you
were
just
telling
me
to
give
you
all
those
well
i
want
george
insisted
what
about
all
the
other
girls
it
your
duty
to
dance
with
they
have
to
go
without
he
said
heartlessly
and
then
with
surprising
vehemence
here
i
want
to
know
are
you
going
to
give
me
those
good
gracious
she
laughed
yes
the
applicants
flocked
round
her
urging
contracts
for
what
remained
but
they
did
not
dislodge
george
from
her
side
though
he
made
it
evident
that
they
succeeded
in
annoying
him
and
presently
he
extricated
her
from
an
accumulating
siege
she
must
have
connived
in
the
extrication
and
bore
her
off
to
sit
beside
him
upon
the
stairway
that
led
to
the
musicians
gallery
where
they
were
sufficiently
retired
yet
had
a
view
of
the
room
how
all
those
ducks
get
to
know
you
so
quick
george
inquired
with
little
enthusiasm
oh
i
been
here
a
looks
as
if
you
been
pretty
busy
he
said
most
of
those
ducks
i
do
know
what
my
mother
wanted
to
invite
here
oh
i
used
to
see
something
of
a
few
of
i
was
president
of
a
club
we
had
here
and
some
of
belonged
to
it
but
i
do
care
much
for
that
sort
of
thing
any
more
i
really
do
see
why
my
mother
invited
perhaps
it
was
on
account
of
their
parents
miss
morgan
suggested
mildly
maybe
she
did
want
to
offend
their
fathers
and
oh
hardly
i
do
think
my
mother
need
worry
much
about
offending
anybody
in
this
old
it
must
be
wonderful
said
miss
morgan
it
must
be
wonderful
amberson
minafer
i
what
must
be
wonderful
to
be
so
important
as
that
that
is
george
assured
her
anybody
that
really
is
anybody
ought
to
be
able
to
do
about
as
they
like
in
their
own
town
i
should
think
she
looked
at
him
critically
from
under
her
shading
lashes
but
her
eyes
grew
gentler
almost
at
once
in
truth
they
became
more
appreciative
than
critical
george
imperious
good
looks
were
altogether
manly
yet
approached
actual
beauty
as
closely
as
a
boy
good
looks
should
dare
and
and
flowers
have
some
effect
upon
girls
as
well
as
upon
boys
miss
morgan
turned
her
eyes
slowly
from
george
and
pressed
her
face
among
the
and
violets
of
the
pretty
bouquet
she
carried
while
from
the
gallery
above
the
music
of
the
next
dance
carolled
out
merrily
in
a
new
the
musicians
made
the
melody
gay
for
the
christmastime
with
chimes
of
sleighbells
and
the
entrance
to
the
shadowed
stairway
framed
the
passing
flushed
and
lively
dancers
but
neither
george
nor
miss
morgan
suggested
moving
to
join
the
dance
the
stairway
was
draughty
the
steps
were
narrow
and
uncomfortable
no
older
person
would
have
remained
in
such
a
place
moreover
these
two
young
people
were
strangers
to
each
other
neither
had
said
anything
in
which
the
other
had
discovered
the
slightest
intrinsic
interest
there
had
not
arisen
between
them
the
beginnings
of
congeniality
or
even
of
friendliness
but
stairways
near
ballrooms
have
more
to
answer
for
than
have
moonlit
lakes
and
mountain
sunsets
some
day
the
laws
of
glamour
must
be
discovered
because
they
are
so
important
that
the
world
would
be
wiser
now
if
sir
isaac
newton
had
been
hit
on
the
head
not
by
an
apple
but
by
a
young
lady
age
confused
by
its
own
long
accumulation
of
follies
is
everlastingly
inquiring
what
does
she
see
in
him
as
if
young
love
came
about
through
thinking
or
through
conduct
age
wants
to
know
what
on
earth
can
they
talk
about
as
if
talking
had
anything
to
do
with
april
rains
at
seventy
one
gets
up
in
the
morning
finds
the
air
sweet
under
a
bright
sun
feels
lively
thinks
i
am
hearty
today
and
plans
to
go
for
a
drive
at
eighteen
one
goes
to
a
dance
sits
with
a
stranger
on
a
stairway
feels
peculiar
thinks
nothing
and
becomes
incapable
of
any
plan
whatever
miss
morgan
and
george
stayed
where
they
were
they
had
agreed
to
this
in
silence
and
without
knowing
it
certainly
without
exchanging
glances
of
intelligence
they
had
exchanged
no
glances
at
all
both
sat
staring
vaguely
out
into
the
ballroom
and
for
a
time
they
did
not
speak
over
their
heads
the
music
reached
a
climax
of
vivacity
drums
cymbals
triangle
and
sleighbells
beating
clashing
tinkling
here
and
there
were
to
be
seen
couples
so
carried
away
that
ceasing
to
move
at
the
decorous
even
glide
considered
most
knowing
they
pranced
and
whirled
through
the
throng
from
wall
to
wall
galloping
bounteously
in
abandon
george
suffered
a
shock
of
vague
surprise
when
he
perceived
that
his
aunt
fanny
minafer
was
the
of
one
of
these
wild
couples
fanny
minafer
who
rouged
a
little
was
like
fruit
which
in
some
climates
dries
with
the
bloom
on
her
features
had
remained
prettily
childlike
so
had
her
figure
and
there
were
times
when
strangers
seeing
her
across
the
street
took
her
to
be
about
twenty
they
were
other
times
when
at
the
same
distance
they
took
her
to
be
about
sixty
instead
of
forty
as
she
was
she
had
old
days
and
young
days
old
hours
and
young
hours
old
minutes
and
young
minutes
for
the
change
might
be
that
quick
an
alteration
in
her
expression
or
a
difference
in
the
attitude
of
her
head
would
cause
astonishing
indentations
to
appear
and
behold
fanny
was
an
old
lady
but
she
had
been
never
more
childlike
than
she
was
tonight
as
she
flew
over
the
floor
in
the
capable
arms
of
the
duck
for
this
person
was
her
partner
the
duck
had
been
a
real
dancer
in
his
day
it
appeared
and
evidently
his
day
was
not
yet
over
in
spite
of
the
headlong
gay
rapidity
with
which
he
bore
miss
fanny
about
the
big
room
he
danced
authoritatively
avoiding
without
effort
the
lightest
collision
with
other
couples
maintaining
sufficient
grace
throughout
his
wildest
moments
and
all
the
while
laughing
and
talking
with
his
partner
what
was
most
remarkable
to
george
and
a
little
irritating
this
stranger
in
the
amberson
mansion
had
no
vestige
of
the
air
of
deference
proper
to
a
stranger
in
such
a
place
he
seemed
thoroughly
at
home
he
seemed
offensively
so
indeed
when
passing
the
entrance
to
the
gallery
stairway
he
disengaged
his
hand
from
miss
fanny
for
an
instant
and
not
pausing
in
the
dance
waved
a
laughing
salutation
more
than
cordial
then
capered
lightly
out
of
sight
george
gazed
stonily
at
this
manifestation
responding
neither
by
word
nor
sign
how
that
for
a
bit
of
freshness
he
murmured
what
was
miss
morgan
asked
that
duck
waving
his
hand
at
me
like
that
except
the
sharon
girls
uncle
i
do
know
him
from
you
do
need
to
she
said
he
was
waving
his
hand
to
you
he
meant
oh
he
did
george
was
not
mollified
by
the
explanation
everybody
seems
to
mean
you
you
certainly
do
seem
to
been
pretty
busy
this
week
you
been
here
she
pressed
her
bouquet
to
her
face
again
and
laughed
into
it
not
displeased
she
made
no
other
comment
and
for
another
period
neither
spoke
meanwhile
the
music
stopped
loud
applause
insisted
upon
its
renewal
an
encore
was
danced
there
was
an
interlude
of
voices
and
the
changing
of
partners
began
well
said
george
finally
i
must
say
you
do
seem
to
be
much
of
a
prattler
they
say
it
a
great
way
to
get
a
reputation
for
being
wise
never
saying
much
do
you
ever
talk
any
when
people
can
understand
she
answered
he
had
been
looking
moodily
out
at
the
ballroom
but
he
turned
to
her
quickly
at
this
saw
that
her
eyes
were
sunny
and
content
over
the
top
of
her
bouquet
and
he
consented
to
smile
girls
are
usually
pretty
fresh
he
said
they
ought
to
go
to
a
college
about
a
year
they
get
taught
a
few
things
about
freshness
what
you
got
to
do
after
two
afternoon
a
whole
lot
of
things
every
minute
filled
all
right
said
george
the
snow
fine
for
sleighing
i
come
for
you
in
a
cutter
at
ten
minutes
after
i
ca
possibly
if
you
do
he
said
i
going
to
sit
in
the
cutter
in
front
of
the
gate
wherever
you
visiting
all
afternoon
and
if
you
try
to
go
out
with
anybody
else
he
got
to
whip
me
before
he
gets
and
as
she
laughed
though
she
blushed
a
little
too
he
continued
seriously
if
you
think
i
not
in
earnest
you
at
liberty
to
make
quite
a
big
experiment
she
laughed
again
i
do
think
i
often
had
so
large
a
compliment
as
that
she
said
especially
on
such
short
notice
and
yet
i
think
i
go
with
you
you
be
ready
at
ten
minutes
after
no
i
yes
you
will
yes
she
said
i
will
and
her
partner
for
the
next
dance
arrived
breathless
with
searching
do
forget
i
got
the
third
from
now
george
called
after
her
i
and
every
third
one
after
i
know
she
called
over
her
partner
shoulder
and
her
voice
was
amused
but
meek
when
the
third
from
now
came
george
presented
himself
before
her
without
any
greeting
like
a
brother
or
a
mannerless
old
friend
neither
did
she
greet
him
but
moved
away
with
him
concluding
as
she
went
an
exchange
of
badinage
with
the
preceding
partner
she
had
been
talkative
enough
with
him
it
appeared
in
fact
both
george
and
miss
morgan
talked
much
more
to
every
one
else
that
evening
than
to
each
other
and
they
said
nothing
at
all
at
this
time
both
looked
preoccupied
as
they
began
to
dance
and
preserved
a
gravity
of
expression
to
the
end
of
the
number
and
when
the
third
one
after
that
came
they
did
not
dance
but
went
back
to
the
gallery
stairway
seeming
to
have
reached
an
understanding
without
any
verbal
consultation
that
this
suburb
was
again
the
place
for
them
well
said
george
coolly
when
they
were
seated
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
funny
name
everybody
else
name
always
i
did
mean
it
was
really
funny
george
explained
that
just
one
of
my
crowd
bits
of
horsing
at
college
we
always
say
name
no
matter
what
it
is
i
guess
we
pretty
fresh
sometimes
but
i
knew
your
name
was
morgan
because
my
mother
said
so
downstairs
i
meant
the
rest
of
it
he
was
silent
is
a
funny
name
too
she
inquired
no
lucy
very
much
all
right
he
said
and
he
went
so
far
as
to
smile
even
his
aunt
fanny
admitted
that
when
george
smiled
in
a
certain
way
he
was
charming
thanks
about
letting
my
name
be
lucy
she
said
how
old
are
you
george
asked
i
do
really
know
what
do
you
mean
you
do
really
know
yourself
i
mean
i
only
know
what
they
tell
me
i
believe
them
of
course
but
believing
is
really
knowing
you
believe
some
certain
day
is
your
birthday
at
least
i
suppose
you
do
but
you
do
really
know
it
is
because
you
ca
look
here
said
george
do
you
always
talk
like
this
miss
lucy
morgan
laughed
forgivingly
put
her
young
head
on
one
side
like
a
bird
and
responded
cheerfully
i
willing
to
learn
wisdom
what
are
you
studying
in
school
college
at
the
university
yes
what
are
you
studying
there
george
laughed
lot
o
useless
guff
then
why
do
you
study
some
useful
guff
what
do
you
mean
something
you
use
later
in
your
business
or
profession
george
waved
his
hand
impatiently
i
do
expect
to
go
into
any
or
no
certainly
not
george
was
emphatic
being
sincerely
annoyed
by
a
suggestion
which
showed
how
utterly
she
failed
to
comprehend
the
kind
of
person
he
was
why
not
she
asked
mildly
just
look
at
he
said
almost
with
bitterness
and
he
made
a
gesture
presumably
intended
to
indicate
the
business
and
professional
men
now
dancing
within
range
of
vision
that
a
fine
career
for
a
man
is
it
lawyers
bankers
politicians
what
do
they
get
out
of
life
i
like
to
know
what
do
they
ever
know
about
real
things
where
do
they
ever
get
he
was
so
earnest
that
she
was
surprised
and
impressed
evidently
he
had
ambitions
for
he
seemed
to
speak
with
actual
emotion
of
these
despised
things
which
were
so
far
beneath
his
planning
for
the
future
she
had
a
vague
momentary
vision
of
pitt
at
prime
minister
of
england
and
she
spoke
involuntarily
in
a
lowered
voice
with
deference
what
do
you
want
to
be
she
asked
george
answered
promptly
a
yachtsman
he
said
chapter
vi
having
thus
in
a
word
revealed
his
ambition
for
a
career
above
courts
marts
and
polling
booths
george
breathed
more
deeply
than
usual
and
turning
his
face
from
the
lovely
companion
whom
he
had
just
made
his
confidant
gazed
out
at
the
dancers
with
an
expression
in
which
there
was
both
sternness
and
a
contempt
for
the
squalid
lives
of
the
unyachted
midlanders
before
him
however
among
them
he
marked
his
mother
and
his
sombre
grandeur
relaxed
momentarily
a
more
genial
light
came
into
his
eyes
isabel
was
dancing
with
the
duck
and
it
was
to
be
noted
that
the
lively
gentleman
gait
was
more
sedate
than
it
had
been
with
miss
fanny
minafer
but
not
less
dexterous
and
authoritative
he
was
talking
to
isabel
as
gaily
as
he
had
talked
to
miss
fanny
though
with
less
laughter
and
isabel
listened
and
answered
eagerly
her
colour
was
high
and
her
eyes
had
a
look
of
delight
she
saw
george
and
the
beautiful
lucy
on
the
stairway
and
nodded
to
them
george
waved
his
hand
vaguely
he
had
a
momentary
return
of
that
inexplicable
uneasiness
and
resentment
which
had
troubled
him
downstairs
how
lovely
your
mother
is
lucy
said
i
think
she
is
he
agreed
gently
she
the
gracefulest
woman
in
that
ballroom
she
dances
like
a
girl
of
most
girls
of
sixteen
said
george
are
bum
dancers
anyhow
i
would
dance
with
one
unless
i
had
well
you
better
dance
with
your
mother
i
never
saw
anybody
lovelier
how
wonderfully
they
dance
together
who
your
mother
and
and
the
duck
said
lucy
i
going
to
dance
with
him
pretty
i
do
care
so
long
as
you
do
give
him
one
of
the
numbers
that
belong
to
i
try
to
remember
she
said
and
thoughtfully
lifted
to
her
face
the
bouquet
of
violets
and
lilies
a
gesture
which
george
noted
without
approval
look
here
who
sent
you
those
flowers
you
keep
makin
such
a
fuss
over
he
who
the
george
feared
no
such
rival
he
laughed
loudly
i
he
some
old
widower
he
said
the
object
thus
described
seeming
ignominious
enough
to
a
person
of
eighteen
without
additional
characterization
some
old
widower
lucy
became
serious
at
once
yes
he
is
a
widower
she
said
i
ought
to
have
told
you
before
he
my
george
stopped
laughing
abruptly
well
that
a
horse
on
me
if
known
he
was
your
father
of
course
i
would
have
made
fun
of
him
nobody
could
make
fun
of
him
she
said
quietly
why
could
they
it
would
make
him
funny
it
would
only
make
themselves
upon
this
george
had
a
gleam
of
intelligence
well
i
not
going
to
make
myself
silly
any
more
then
i
do
want
to
take
chances
like
that
with
you
but
i
thought
he
was
the
sharon
girls
uncle
he
came
with
them
yes
she
said
i
always
late
to
everything
i
would
let
them
wait
for
me
we
visiting
the
about
time
i
knew
that
you
forget
my
being
so
fresh
about
your
father
will
you
of
course
he
a
distinguished
looking
man
in
a
lucy
was
still
serious
in
a
way
she
repeated
you
mean
not
in
your
way
do
you
george
was
perplexed
how
do
you
mean
not
in
my
way
people
pretty
often
say
a
way
and
distinguished
looking
or
or
anything
to
show
that
superior
do
they
in
new
york
last
month
i
overheard
a
climber
sort
of
woman
speaking
of
me
as
miss
morgan
but
she
did
mean
my
height
she
meant
that
she
was
important
her
husband
spoke
of
a
friend
of
mine
as
pembroke
and
is
this
husband
and
wife
were
really
so
terribly
unimportant
that
the
only
way
they
knew
to
pretend
to
be
important
was
calling
people
miss
or
mister
it
a
kind
of
snob
slang
i
think
of
course
people
do
always
say
or
a
to
be
i
should
say
not
i
use
both
of
a
great
deal
myself
said
george
one
thing
i
do
see
though
what
the
use
of
a
man
being
men
that
size
ca
handle
themselves
as
well
as
a
man
about
and
a
half
can
those
long
gangling
men
nearly
always
too
kind
of
wormy
to
be
any
good
in
athletics
and
so
awkward
they
keep
falling
over
chairs
or
mr
pembroke
is
in
the
army
said
lucy
primly
he
extraordinarily
in
the
army
oh
i
suppose
he
some
old
friend
of
your
they
got
on
very
well
she
said
after
i
introduced
george
was
a
straightforward
soul
at
least
see
here
he
said
are
you
engaged
to
anybody
not
wholly
mollified
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
seem
to
know
a
good
many
people
do
you
live
in
new
york
no
we
do
live
what
you
mean
you
do
live
anywhere
we
lived
all
over
she
answered
papa
used
to
live
here
in
this
town
but
that
was
before
i
was
what
do
you
keep
moving
around
so
for
is
he
a
promoter
no
he
an
what
he
invented
just
lately
said
lucy
he
been
working
on
a
new
kind
of
horseless
well
i
sorry
for
him
george
said
in
no
unkindly
spirit
those
things
are
never
going
to
amount
to
anything
people
are
going
to
spend
their
lives
lying
on
their
backs
in
the
road
and
letting
grease
drip
in
their
faces
horseless
carriages
are
pretty
much
a
failure
and
your
father
better
not
waste
his
time
on
papa
be
so
grateful
she
returned
if
he
could
have
your
instantly
george
face
became
flushed
i
do
know
that
i
done
anything
to
be
insulted
for
he
said
i
do
see
that
what
i
said
was
particularly
no
indeed
then
what
do
you
she
laughed
gaily
i
do
and
i
do
mind
your
being
such
a
lofty
person
at
all
i
think
it
ever
so
interesting
but
papa
a
great
man
is
he
george
decided
to
be
well
let
us
hope
so
i
hope
so
i
looking
at
him
keenly
she
saw
that
the
magnificent
youth
was
incredibly
sincere
in
this
bit
of
graciousness
he
spoke
as
a
tolerant
elderly
statesman
might
speak
of
a
promising
young
politician
and
with
her
eyes
still
upon
him
lucy
shook
her
head
in
gentle
wonder
i
just
beginning
to
understand
she
said
understand
what
what
it
means
to
be
a
real
amberson
in
this
town
papa
told
me
something
about
it
before
we
came
but
i
see
he
did
say
half
enough
george
superbly
took
this
all
for
tribute
did
your
father
say
he
knew
the
family
before
he
left
here
yes
i
believe
he
was
particularly
a
friend
of
your
uncle
george
and
he
did
say
so
but
i
imagine
he
must
have
known
your
mother
very
well
too
he
was
an
inventor
then
he
was
a
young
lawyer
the
town
was
smaller
in
those
days
and
i
believe
he
was
quite
well
i
dare
say
i
no
doubt
the
family
are
all
very
glad
to
see
him
back
especially
if
they
used
to
have
him
at
the
house
a
good
deal
as
he
told
i
do
think
he
meant
to
boast
of
it
she
said
he
spoke
of
it
quite
george
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
perplexity
then
perceiving
that
her
intention
was
satirical
girls
really
ought
to
go
to
a
college
he
said
just
a
month
or
two
anyhow
it
take
some
of
the
freshness
out
of
i
ca
believe
it
she
retorted
as
her
partner
for
the
next
dance
arrived
it
would
only
make
them
a
little
politer
on
the
surface
they
be
really
just
as
awful
as
ever
after
you
got
to
know
them
a
few
what
do
you
mean
you
got
to
know
them
a
she
was
departing
to
the
dance
janie
and
mary
sharon
told
me
all
about
what
sort
of
a
little
boy
you
were
she
said
over
her
shoulder
you
must
think
it
out
she
took
wing
away
on
the
breeze
of
the
waltz
and
george
having
stared
gloomily
after
her
for
a
few
moments
postponed
filling
an
engagement
and
strolled
round
the
fluctuating
outskirts
of
the
dance
to
where
his
uncle
george
amberson
stood
smilingly
watching
under
one
of
the
arches
at
the
entrance
to
the
room
hello
young
namesake
said
the
uncle
why
lingers
the
laggard
heel
of
the
dancer
have
you
got
a
partner
she
sitting
around
waiting
for
me
somewhere
said
george
see
here
who
is
this
fellow
morgan
that
aunt
fanny
minafer
was
dancing
with
a
while
amberson
laughed
he
a
man
with
a
pretty
daughter
georgie
meseemed
you
been
spending
the
evening
noticing
something
of
that
sort
or
do
i
err
never
mind
what
sort
is
he
i
think
we
have
to
give
him
a
character
georgie
he
an
old
friend
used
to
practice
law
here
perhaps
he
had
more
debts
than
cases
but
he
paid
all
up
before
he
left
town
your
question
is
purely
mercenary
i
take
it
you
want
to
know
his
true
worth
before
proceeding
further
with
the
daughter
i
can
not
inform
you
though
i
notice
signs
of
considerable
prosperity
in
that
becoming
dress
of
hers
however
you
never
can
tell
it
is
an
age
when
every
sacrifice
is
made
for
the
young
and
how
your
own
poor
mother
managed
to
provide
those
genuine
pearl
studs
for
you
out
of
her
allowance
from
father
i
ca
oh
dry
up
said
the
nephew
i
understand
this
morgan
mr
eugene
morgan
his
uncle
suggested
politeness
requires
that
the
young
should
i
guess
the
did
know
much
about
politeness
in
your
day
george
interrupted
i
understand
that
eugene
morgan
used
to
be
a
great
friend
of
the
oh
the
minafers
the
uncle
inquired
with
apparent
innocence
no
i
seem
to
recall
that
he
and
your
father
were
not
i
mean
the
ambersons
george
said
impatiently
i
understand
he
was
a
good
deal
around
the
house
what
is
your
objection
to
that
george
what
do
you
mean
my
objection
you
seemed
to
speak
with
a
certain
well
said
george
i
meant
he
seems
to
feel
awfully
at
home
here
the
way
he
was
dancing
with
aunt
fanny
amberson
laughed
i
afraid
your
aunt
fanny
heart
was
stirred
by
ancient
recollections
you
mean
she
used
to
be
silly
about
him
she
was
considered
singular
said
the
uncle
he
was
he
was
popular
could
you
bear
a
question
what
do
you
mean
could
i
bear
i
only
wanted
to
ask
do
you
take
this
same
passionate
interest
in
the
parents
of
every
girl
you
dance
with
perhaps
it
a
new
fashion
we
old
bachelors
ought
to
take
up
is
it
the
thing
this
year
to
oh
go
on
said
george
moving
away
i
only
wanted
to
know
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
a
girl
sat
waiting
for
his
nobility
to
find
time
to
fulfil
his
contract
with
her
for
this
dance
pardon
f
keep
wait
he
muttered
as
she
rose
brightly
to
meet
him
and
she
seemed
pleased
that
he
came
at
all
but
george
was
used
to
girls
looking
radiant
when
he
danced
with
them
and
she
had
little
effect
upon
him
he
danced
with
her
perfunctorily
thinking
the
while
of
eugene
morgan
and
his
daughter
strangely
enough
his
thoughts
dwelt
more
upon
the
father
than
the
daughter
though
george
could
not
possibly
have
given
a
reason
even
to
himself
for
this
disturbing
preponderance
by
a
coincidence
though
not
an
odd
one
the
thoughts
and
conversation
of
eugene
morgan
at
this
very
time
were
concerned
with
george
amberson
minafer
rather
casually
it
is
true
morgan
had
retired
to
a
room
set
apart
for
smoking
on
the
second
floor
and
had
found
a
grizzled
gentleman
lounging
in
solitary
possession
morgan
this
person
exclaimed
rising
with
great
heartiness
i
heard
you
were
in
town
i
do
believe
you
know
me
yes
i
do
fred
kinney
morgan
returned
with
equal
friendliness
your
real
face
the
one
i
used
to
know
it
just
underneath
the
one
you
masquerading
in
you
ought
to
have
changed
it
more
if
you
wanted
a
twenty
years
said
kinney
it
makes
some
difference
in
faces
but
more
in
behaviour
it
does
so
his
friend
agreed
with
explosive
emphasis
my
own
behaviour
began
to
be
different
about
that
long
ago
quite
i
remember
said
kinney
sympathetically
well
life
odd
enough
as
we
look
probably
it
going
to
be
odder
still
if
we
could
look
they
sat
and
smoked
however
morgan
remarked
presently
i
still
dance
like
an
indian
do
you
no
i
leave
that
to
my
boy
fred
he
does
the
dancing
for
the
i
suppose
he
upstairs
hard
at
it
no
he
not
kinney
glanced
toward
the
open
door
and
lowered
his
voice
he
would
come
it
seems
that
a
couple
of
years
or
so
ago
he
had
a
row
with
young
georgie
minafer
fred
was
president
of
a
literary
club
they
had
and
he
said
this
young
georgie
got
himself
elected
instead
in
an
overbearing
sort
of
way
fred
you
know
i
suppose
you
remember
his
mother
you
were
at
the
wedding
i
remember
the
wedding
said
morgan
and
i
remember
your
bachelor
dinner
most
of
it
that
well
my
boy
fred
as
now
kinney
went
on
as
his
mother
was
then
and
he
very
bitter
about
his
row
with
georgie
minafer
he
says
he
rather
burn
his
foot
off
than
set
it
inside
any
amberson
house
or
any
place
else
where
young
georgie
is
fact
is
the
boy
seemed
to
have
so
much
feeling
over
it
i
had
my
doubts
about
coming
myself
but
my
wife
said
it
was
all
nonsense
we
must
humour
fred
in
a
grudge
over
such
a
little
thing
and
while
she
despised
that
georgie
minafer
herself
as
much
as
any
one
else
did
she
was
going
to
miss
a
big
amberson
show
just
on
account
of
a
boys
rumpus
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
we
do
people
dislike
young
minafer
generally
i
do
know
about
i
guess
he
gets
plenty
of
toadying
but
there
certainly
a
lot
of
people
that
are
glad
to
express
their
opinions
about
what
the
matter
with
him
too
much
amberson
i
suppose
for
one
thing
and
for
another
his
mother
just
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
from
the
day
he
was
born
what
beats
me
i
do
have
to
tell
you
what
isabel
amberson
is
eugene
morgan
she
got
a
touch
of
the
amberson
high
stuff
about
her
but
you
ca
get
anybody
that
ever
knew
her
to
deny
that
she
just
about
the
finest
woman
in
the
no
said
eugene
morgan
you
ca
get
anybody
to
deny
then
i
ca
see
how
she
does
see
the
truth
about
that
boy
he
thinks
he
a
little
tin
god
on
wheels
and
honestly
it
makes
some
people
weak
and
sick
just
to
think
about
him
yet
that
intelligent
woman
isabel
amberson
actually
sits
and
worships
him
you
can
hear
it
in
her
voice
when
she
speaks
to
him
or
speaks
of
him
you
can
see
it
in
her
eyes
when
she
looks
at
him
my
lord
what
does
she
see
when
she
looks
at
him
morgan
odd
expression
of
genial
apprehension
deepened
whimsically
though
it
denoted
no
actual
apprehension
whatever
and
cleared
away
from
his
face
altogether
when
he
smiled
he
became
surprisingly
winning
and
persuasive
when
he
smiled
he
smiled
now
after
a
moment
at
this
question
of
his
old
friend
she
sees
something
that
we
do
see
he
said
what
does
she
see
an
kinney
laughed
aloud
well
if
she
sees
an
angel
when
she
looks
at
georgie
minafer
she
a
funnier
woman
than
i
thought
she
was
perhaps
she
is
said
morgan
but
that
what
she
my
lord
it
easy
to
see
you
only
known
him
an
hour
or
so
in
that
time
have
you
looked
at
georgie
and
seen
an
angel
no
all
i
saw
was
a
remarkably
with
the
pride
of
satan
and
a
set
of
nice
new
manners
that
he
probably
could
use
more
than
half
an
hour
at
a
time
without
then
what
mothers
are
right
said
morgan
do
you
think
this
young
george
is
the
same
sort
of
creature
when
he
with
his
mother
that
he
is
when
bulldozing
your
boy
fred
mothers
see
the
angel
in
us
because
the
angel
is
there
if
it
shown
to
the
mother
the
son
has
got
an
angel
to
show
has
he
when
a
son
cuts
somebody
throat
the
mother
only
sees
possible
for
a
misguided
angel
to
act
like
a
devil
and
she
entirely
right
about
that
kinney
laughed
and
put
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
i
remember
what
a
fellow
you
always
were
to
argue
he
said
you
mean
georgie
minafer
is
as
much
of
an
angel
as
any
murderer
is
and
that
mother
is
always
i
afraid
she
always
has
been
morgan
said
lightly
the
friendly
hand
remained
upon
his
shoulder
she
was
wrong
once
old
fellow
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
no
said
morgan
a
little
awkwardly
no
kinney
relieved
the
slight
embarrassment
that
had
come
upon
both
of
them
he
laughed
again
wait
till
you
know
young
georgie
a
little
better
he
said
something
tells
me
you
going
to
change
your
mind
about
his
having
an
angel
to
show
if
you
see
anything
of
him
you
mean
beauty
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
and
the
angel
is
all
in
the
eye
of
the
mother
if
you
were
a
painter
fred
you
paint
mothers
with
angels
eyes
holding
imps
in
their
laps
me
i
stick
to
the
old
masters
and
the
kinney
looked
at
him
musingly
somebody
eyes
must
have
been
pretty
angelic
he
said
if
they
been
persuading
you
that
georgie
minnafer
is
a
cherub
they
are
said
morgan
heartily
they
more
angelic
than
and
as
a
new
flourish
of
music
sounded
overhead
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
jumped
up
briskly
i
got
this
dance
with
with
whom
with
isabel
the
grizzled
kinney
affected
to
rub
his
eyes
it
startles
me
your
jumping
up
like
that
to
go
and
dance
with
isabel
amberson
twenty
years
seem
to
have
passed
but
have
they
tell
me
have
you
danced
with
poor
old
fanny
too
this
evening
twice
my
lord
kinney
groaned
half
in
earnest
old
times
starting
all
over
again
my
lord
old
times
morgan
laughed
gaily
from
the
doorway
not
a
bit
there
are
any
old
times
when
times
are
gone
they
not
old
they
dead
there
are
any
times
but
new
times
and
he
vanished
in
such
a
manner
that
he
seemed
already
to
have
begun
dancing
chapter
vii
the
appearance
of
miss
lucy
morgan
the
next
day
as
she
sat
in
fast
cutter
proved
so
charming
that
her
escort
was
stricken
to
soft
words
instantly
and
failed
to
control
a
poetic
impulse
her
rich
little
hat
was
trimmed
with
black
fur
her
hair
was
almost
as
dark
as
the
fur
a
great
boa
of
black
fur
was
about
her
shoulders
her
hands
were
vanished
into
a
black
muff
and
george
laprobe
was
black
you
look
like
he
said
your
face
looks
like
it
looks
like
a
snowflake
on
a
lump
of
coal
i
mean
a
a
snowflake
that
would
be
a
too
perhaps
you
better
look
at
the
reins
she
returned
we
almost
upset
just
george
declined
to
heed
this
advice
because
there
too
much
pink
in
your
cheeks
for
a
snowflake
he
continued
what
that
fairy
story
about
and
we
going
pretty
fast
minafer
well
you
see
i
only
here
for
two
i
mean
the
sleigh
she
explained
we
not
the
only
people
on
the
street
you
oh
they
keep
out
of
the
that
very
patrician
charioteering
but
it
seems
to
me
a
horse
like
this
needs
guidance
i
sure
he
going
almost
twenty
miles
an
that
nothing
said
george
but
he
consented
to
look
forward
again
he
can
trot
under
three
minutes
all
he
laughed
i
suppose
your
father
thinks
he
can
build
a
horseless
carriage
to
go
that
fast
they
go
that
fast
already
yes
said
george
they
do
for
about
a
hundred
feet
then
they
give
a
yell
and
burn
evidently
she
decided
not
to
defend
her
father
faith
in
horseless
carriages
for
she
laughed
and
said
nothing
the
cold
air
was
with
snowflakes
and
trembled
to
the
loud
continuous
jingling
of
sleighbells
boys
and
girls
all
aglow
and
panting
jets
of
vapour
darted
at
the
passing
sleighs
to
ride
on
the
runners
or
sought
to
rope
their
sleds
to
any
vehicle
whatever
but
the
fleetest
no
more
than
just
touched
the
flying
cutter
though
a
hundred
soggy
mittens
grasped
for
it
then
reeled
and
whirled
till
sometimes
the
wearers
of
those
daring
mittens
plunged
flat
in
the
snow
and
lay
reflecting
for
this
was
the
holiday
time
and
all
the
boys
and
girls
in
town
were
out
most
of
them
on
national
avenue
but
there
came
panting
and
chugging
up
that
flat
thoroughfare
a
thing
which
some
day
was
to
spoil
all
their
merriment
save
for
the
rashest
and
most
disobedient
it
was
vaguely
like
a
topless
surry
but
cumbrous
with
unwholesome
excrescences
fore
and
aft
while
underneath
were
spinning
leather
belts
and
something
that
whirred
and
howled
and
seemed
to
stagger
the
made
no
attempt
to
fasten
their
sleds
to
a
contrivance
so
nonsensical
and
yet
so
fearsome
instead
they
gave
over
their
sport
and
concentrated
all
their
energies
in
their
lungs
so
that
up
and
down
the
street
the
one
cry
shrilled
increasingly
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
mister
why
you
git
a
hoss
but
the
mahout
in
charge
sitting
solitary
on
the
front
seat
was
unconcerned
he
laughed
and
now
and
then
ducked
a
snowball
without
losing
any
of
his
it
was
eugene
morgan
who
exhibited
so
cheerful
a
countenance
between
the
forward
visor
of
a
cap
and
the
collar
of
a
fuzzy
gray
ulster
git
a
hoss
the
children
shrieked
and
gruffer
voices
joined
them
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
george
minafer
was
correct
thus
far
the
twelve
miles
an
hour
of
such
a
machine
would
never
george
trotter
the
cutter
was
already
scurrying
between
the
stone
pillars
at
the
entrance
to
amberson
addition
that
my
grandfather
said
george
nodding
toward
the
amberson
mansion
i
ought
to
know
that
lucy
exclaimed
we
stayed
there
late
enough
last
night
papa
and
i
were
almost
the
last
to
go
he
and
your
mother
and
miss
fanny
minafer
got
the
musicians
to
play
another
waltz
when
everybody
else
had
gone
downstairs
and
the
fiddles
were
being
put
away
in
their
cases
papa
danced
part
of
it
with
miss
minafer
and
the
rest
with
your
mother
miss
minafer
your
aunt
is
she
yes
she
lives
with
us
i
tease
her
a
good
what
about
oh
anything
handy
whatever
easy
to
tease
an
old
maid
does
she
mind
she
usually
has
sort
of
a
grouch
on
me
laughed
george
nothing
much
that
our
house
just
beyond
he
waved
a
sealskin
gauntlet
to
indicate
the
house
major
amberson
had
built
for
isabel
as
a
wedding
gift
it
almost
the
same
as
grandfather
only
not
as
large
and
has
got
a
regular
ballroom
we
gave
the
dance
last
night
at
grandfather
on
account
of
the
ballroom
and
because
i
the
only
grandchild
you
know
of
course
some
day
that
be
my
house
though
i
expect
my
mother
will
most
likely
go
on
living
where
she
does
now
with
father
and
aunt
fanny
i
suppose
i
probably
build
a
country
house
too
somewhere
east
i
he
stopped
speaking
and
frowned
as
they
passed
a
closed
carriage
and
pair
the
body
of
this
comfortable
vehicle
sagged
slightly
to
one
side
the
paint
was
old
and
seamed
with
hundreds
of
minute
cracks
like
little
rivers
on
a
black
map
the
coachman
a
fat
and
elderly
darky
seemed
to
drowse
upon
the
box
but
the
open
window
afforded
the
occupants
of
the
cutter
a
glimpse
of
a
tired
fine
old
face
a
silk
hat
a
pearl
tie
and
an
astrachan
collar
evidently
out
to
take
the
air
there
your
grandfather
now
said
lucy
is
it
george
frown
was
not
relaxed
yes
it
is
and
he
ought
to
give
that
away
and
sell
those
old
horses
they
a
disgrace
all
shaggy
not
even
clipped
i
suppose
he
does
notice
it
people
get
awful
funny
when
they
get
old
they
seem
to
lose
their
sort
he
seemed
a
real
brummell
to
me
she
said
oh
he
keeps
up
about
what
he
wears
well
enough
but
well
look
at
that
he
pointed
to
a
statue
of
minerva
one
of
the
sculptures
major
amberson
had
set
up
in
opening
the
addition
years
before
minerva
was
intact
but
a
blackish
streak
descended
unpleasantly
from
her
forehead
to
the
point
of
her
straight
nose
and
a
few
other
streaks
were
sketched
in
a
repellent
dinge
upon
the
folds
of
her
drapery
that
must
be
from
soot
said
lucy
there
are
so
many
houses
around
anyhow
somebody
ought
to
see
that
these
statues
are
kept
clean
my
grandfather
owns
a
good
many
of
these
houses
i
guess
for
renting
of
course
he
sold
most
of
the
lots
there
are
any
vacant
ones
and
there
used
to
be
heaps
of
when
i
was
a
boy
another
thing
i
think
he
ought
to
allow
a
good
many
of
these
people
bought
big
lots
and
they
built
houses
on
then
the
price
of
the
land
kept
getting
higher
and
they
sell
part
of
their
yards
and
let
the
people
that
bought
it
build
houses
on
it
to
live
in
till
they
have
hardly
any
of
got
big
open
yards
any
more
and
it
getting
all
too
much
built
up
the
way
it
used
to
be
it
was
like
a
gentleman
country
estate
and
that
the
way
my
grandfather
ought
to
keep
it
he
lets
these
people
take
too
many
liberties
they
do
anything
they
want
but
how
could
he
stop
them
lucy
asked
surely
with
reason
if
he
sold
them
the
land
it
theirs
is
it
george
remained
serene
in
the
face
of
this
apparently
difficult
question
he
ought
to
have
all
the
boycott
the
families
that
sell
part
of
their
yards
that
way
all
he
have
to
do
would
be
to
tell
the
they
would
get
any
more
orders
from
the
family
if
they
did
do
from
family
what
family
our
family
said
george
unperturbed
the
i
see
she
murmured
and
evidently
she
did
see
something
that
he
did
not
for
as
she
lifted
her
muff
to
her
face
he
asked
what
are
you
laughing
at
now
why
you
always
seem
to
have
some
little
secret
of
your
own
to
get
happy
over
always
she
exclaimed
what
a
big
word
when
we
only
met
last
night
that
another
case
of
it
he
said
with
obvious
sincerity
one
of
the
reasons
i
do
like
you
much
is
you
got
that
way
of
seeming
quietly
superior
to
everybody
i
she
cried
i
have
oh
you
think
you
keep
it
sort
of
confidential
to
yourself
but
plain
enough
i
do
believe
in
that
kind
of
you
do
no
said
george
emphatically
not
with
me
i
think
the
world
like
this
there
a
few
people
that
their
birth
and
position
and
so
on
puts
them
at
the
top
and
they
ought
to
treat
each
other
entirely
as
his
voice
betrayed
a
little
emotion
as
he
added
i
speak
like
this
to
you
mean
you
confiding
your
deepest
creed
or
code
whatever
it
is
to
me
go
on
make
fun
of
it
then
george
said
bitterly
you
do
think
you
terribly
clever
it
makes
me
tired
well
as
you
do
like
my
seeming
superior
after
this
be
noisily
superior
she
returned
cheerfully
we
aim
to
please
i
had
a
notion
before
i
came
for
you
today
that
we
were
going
to
quarrel
he
said
no
we
wo
it
takes
two
she
laughed
and
waved
her
muff
toward
a
new
house
not
quite
completed
standing
in
a
field
upon
their
right
they
had
passed
beyond
amberson
addition
and
were
leaving
the
northern
fringes
of
the
town
for
the
open
country
is
that
a
beautiful
house
she
exclaimed
papa
and
i
call
it
our
beautiful
george
was
not
pleased
does
it
belong
to
you
of
course
not
papa
brought
me
out
here
the
other
day
driving
in
his
machine
and
we
both
loved
it
it
so
spacious
and
dignified
and
yes
it
plain
enough
george
grunted
yet
it
lovely
the
roof
and
shutters
give
just
enough
colour
with
the
trees
for
the
long
white
walls
it
seems
to
me
the
finest
house
i
seen
in
this
part
of
the
george
was
outraged
by
an
enthusiasm
so
ignorant
not
ten
minutes
ago
they
had
passed
the
amberson
mansion
is
that
a
sample
of
your
taste
in
architecture
he
asked
yes
why
because
it
strikes
me
you
better
go
somewhere
and
study
the
subject
a
little
lucy
looked
puzzled
what
makes
you
have
so
much
feeling
about
it
have
i
offended
you
offended
nothing
george
returned
brusquely
girls
usually
think
they
know
it
all
as
soon
as
they
learned
to
dance
and
dress
and
flirt
a
little
they
never
know
anything
about
things
like
architecture
for
instance
that
house
is
about
as
bum
a
house
as
any
house
i
ever
saw
why
why
george
repeated
did
you
ask
me
why
well
for
one
thing
he
paused
for
one
thing
well
just
look
at
it
i
should
think
you
have
to
do
any
more
than
look
at
it
if
ever
given
any
attention
to
what
is
the
matter
with
its
architecture
minafer
well
it
this
way
said
george
it
like
this
well
for
instance
that
house
well
it
was
built
like
a
town
he
spoke
of
it
in
the
past
tense
because
they
had
now
left
it
far
behind
them
a
human
habit
of
curious
significance
it
was
like
a
house
meant
for
a
street
in
the
city
what
kind
of
a
house
was
that
for
people
of
any
taste
to
build
out
here
in
the
country
but
papa
says
it
built
that
way
on
purpose
there
are
a
lot
of
other
houses
being
built
in
this
direction
and
papa
says
the
city
coming
out
this
way
and
in
a
year
or
two
that
house
will
be
right
in
it
was
a
bum
house
anyhow
said
george
crossly
i
do
even
know
the
people
that
are
building
it
they
say
a
lot
of
riffraff
come
to
town
every
year
nowadays
and
there
other
riffraff
that
have
always
lived
here
and
have
made
a
little
money
and
act
as
if
they
owned
the
place
uncle
sydney
was
talking
about
it
yesterday
he
says
he
and
some
of
his
friends
are
organizing
a
country
club
and
already
some
of
these
riffraff
are
worming
into
it
people
he
never
heard
of
at
all
anyhow
i
guess
it
pretty
clear
you
do
know
a
great
deal
about
she
demonstrated
the
completeness
of
her
amiability
by
laughing
know
something
about
the
north
pole
before
long
she
said
if
we
keep
going
much
farther
in
this
direction
at
this
he
was
remorseful
all
right
we
turn
and
drive
south
awhile
till
you
get
warmed
up
again
i
expect
we
have
been
going
against
the
wind
about
long
enough
indeed
i
sorry
he
said
indeed
i
sorry
in
a
nice
way
and
looked
very
strikingly
handsome
when
he
said
it
she
thought
no
doubt
it
is
true
that
there
is
more
rejoicing
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
repented
than
over
all
the
saints
who
consistently
remain
holy
and
the
rare
sudden
gentlenesses
of
arrogant
people
have
infinitely
more
effect
than
the
continual
gentleness
of
gentle
people
arrogance
turned
gentle
melts
the
heart
and
lucy
gave
her
companion
a
little
sidelong
sunny
nod
of
acknowledgment
george
was
dazzled
by
the
quick
glow
of
her
eyes
and
found
himself
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
having
turned
about
he
kept
his
horse
to
a
walk
and
at
this
gait
the
sleighbells
tinkled
but
intermittently
gleaming
wanly
through
the
whitish
vapour
that
kept
rising
from
the
trotter
body
and
flanks
they
were
like
tiny
and
made
the
only
sounds
in
a
great
winter
silence
the
white
road
ran
between
lonesome
rail
fences
and
frozen
barnyards
beyond
the
fences
showed
sometimes
a
harrow
left
to
rust
with
its
iron
seat
half
filled
with
stiffened
snow
and
sometimes
an
old
dead
buggy
its
wheels
forever
set
it
seemed
in
the
solid
ice
of
deep
ruts
chickens
scratched
the
metallic
earth
with
an
air
of
protest
and
a
masterless
ragged
colt
looked
up
in
sudden
horror
at
the
mild
tinkle
of
the
passing
bells
then
blew
fierce
clouds
of
steam
at
the
sleigh
the
snow
no
longer
fell
and
far
ahead
in
a
grayish
cloud
that
lay
upon
the
land
was
the
town
lucy
looked
at
this
distant
thickening
reflection
when
we
get
this
far
out
we
can
see
there
must
be
quite
a
little
smoke
hanging
over
the
town
she
said
i
suppose
that
because
it
growing
as
it
grows
bigger
it
seems
to
get
ashamed
of
itself
so
it
makes
this
cloud
and
hides
in
it
papa
says
it
used
to
be
a
bit
nicer
when
he
lived
here
he
always
speaks
of
it
differently
he
always
has
a
gentle
look
a
particular
tone
of
voice
i
noticed
he
must
have
been
very
fond
of
it
it
must
have
been
a
lovely
place
everybody
must
have
been
so
jolly
from
the
way
he
talks
you
think
life
here
then
was
just
one
long
midsummer
serenade
he
declares
it
was
always
sunshine
that
the
air
was
like
the
air
anywhere
else
that
as
he
remembers
it
there
always
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
i
doubt
it
i
think
it
seem
to
be
duller
air
to
him
now
just
on
account
of
having
a
little
soot
in
it
sometimes
but
probably
because
he
was
twenty
years
younger
then
it
seems
to
me
the
he
thinks
was
here
is
just
his
being
young
that
he
remembers
i
think
it
was
just
youth
it
is
pretty
pleasant
to
be
young
is
it
she
laughed
absently
then
appeared
to
become
wistful
i
wonder
if
we
really
do
enjoy
it
as
much
as
we
look
back
and
think
we
did
i
do
suppose
so
anyhow
for
my
part
i
feel
as
if
i
must
be
missing
something
about
it
somehow
because
i
do
ever
seem
to
be
thinking
about
what
happening
at
the
present
moment
i
always
looking
forward
to
something
thinking
about
things
that
will
happen
when
i
you
a
funny
girl
george
said
gently
but
your
voice
sounds
pretty
nice
when
you
think
and
talk
along
together
like
that
the
horse
shook
himself
all
over
and
the
impatient
sleighbells
made
his
wish
audible
accordingly
george
tightened
the
reins
and
the
cutter
was
off
again
at
a
trot
no
despicable
rate
of
speed
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
again
passing
lucy
beautiful
house
and
here
george
thought
fit
to
put
an
appendix
to
his
remark
you
a
funny
girl
and
you
know
a
lot
but
i
do
believe
you
know
much
about
architecture
coming
toward
them
black
against
the
snowy
road
was
a
strange
silhouette
it
approached
moderately
and
without
visible
means
of
progression
so
the
matter
seemed
from
a
distance
but
as
the
cutter
shortened
the
distance
the
silhouette
was
revealed
to
be
horseless
carriage
conveying
four
people
atop
morgan
with
mother
beside
him
and
in
the
rear
seat
miss
fanny
minafer
and
the
honorable
george
amberson
all
four
seemed
to
be
in
the
liveliest
humour
like
people
upon
a
new
adventure
and
isabel
waved
her
handkerchief
dashingly
as
the
cutter
flashed
by
them
for
the
lord
sake
george
gasped
your
mother
a
dear
said
lucy
and
she
does
wear
the
most
bewitching
things
she
looked
like
a
russian
princess
though
i
doubt
if
they
that
george
said
nothing
he
drove
on
till
they
had
crossed
amberson
addition
and
reached
the
stone
pillars
at
the
head
of
national
avenue
there
he
turned
let
go
back
and
take
another
look
at
that
old
he
said
it
certainly
is
the
weirdest
craziest
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
presently
they
were
again
in
sight
of
the
old
george
shouted
mockingly
alas
three
figures
stood
in
the
road
and
a
pair
of
legs
with
the
toes
turned
up
indicated
that
a
fourth
figure
lay
upon
its
back
in
the
snow
beneath
a
horseless
carriage
that
had
decided
to
need
a
horse
george
became
vociferous
with
laughter
and
coming
up
at
his
best
gait
snow
spraying
from
runners
and
every
hoof
swerved
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
shot
by
shouting
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
three
hundred
yards
away
he
turned
and
came
back
racing
leaning
out
as
he
passed
to
wave
jeeringly
at
the
group
about
the
disabled
machine
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
git
a
the
trotter
had
broken
into
a
gallop
and
lucy
cried
a
warning
be
careful
she
said
look
where
you
driving
there
a
ditch
on
that
side
look
george
turned
too
late
the
cutter
right
runner
went
into
the
ditch
and
snapped
off
the
little
sleigh
upset
and
after
dragging
its
occupants
some
fifteen
yards
left
them
lying
together
in
a
bank
of
snow
then
the
vigorous
young
horse
kicked
himself
free
of
all
annoyances
and
disappeared
down
the
road
galloping
cheerfully
chapter
viii
when
george
regained
some
measure
of
his
presence
of
mind
miss
lucy
morgan
cheek
snowy
and
cold
was
pressing
his
nose
slightly
to
one
side
his
right
arm
was
firmly
about
her
neck
and
a
monstrous
amount
of
her
fur
boa
seemed
to
mingle
with
an
equally
unplausible
quantity
of
snow
in
his
mouth
he
was
confused
but
conscious
of
no
objection
to
any
of
these
juxtapositions
she
was
apparently
uninjured
for
she
sat
up
hatless
her
hair
down
and
said
mildly
good
heavens
though
her
father
had
been
under
his
machine
when
they
passed
he
was
the
first
to
reach
them
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
his
daughter
but
found
her
already
laughing
and
was
reassured
all
right
he
called
to
isabel
who
was
running
toward
them
ahead
of
her
brother
and
fanny
minafer
this
snowbank
a
feather
bed
nothing
the
matter
with
them
at
all
do
look
so
pale
georgie
she
gasped
georgie
georgie
was
on
his
feet
snow
all
over
him
do
make
a
fuss
mother
nothing
the
matter
that
darned
silly
horse
sudden
tears
stood
in
isabel
eyes
to
see
you
down
underneath
dragging
oh
then
with
shaking
hands
she
began
to
brush
the
snow
from
him
let
me
alone
he
protested
you
ruin
your
gloves
you
getting
snow
all
over
you
and
no
no
she
cried
you
catch
cold
you
must
catch
cold
and
she
continued
to
brush
him
amberson
had
brought
lucy
hat
miss
fanny
acted
as
and
both
victims
of
the
accident
were
presently
restored
to
about
their
usual
appearance
and
condition
of
apparel
in
fact
encouraged
by
the
two
older
gentlemen
the
entire
party
with
one
exception
decided
that
the
episode
was
after
all
a
merry
one
and
began
to
laugh
about
it
but
george
was
glummer
than
the
december
twilight
now
swiftly
closing
in
that
darned
horse
he
said
i
would
bother
about
pendennis
georgie
said
his
uncle
you
can
send
a
man
out
for
what
left
of
the
cutter
tomorrow
and
pendennis
will
gallop
straight
home
to
his
stable
he
be
there
a
long
while
before
we
will
because
all
we
got
to
depend
on
to
get
us
home
is
gene
morgan
they
were
approaching
the
machine
as
he
spoke
and
his
friend
again
underneath
it
heard
him
he
emerged
smiling
she
go
he
said
what
all
aboard
he
offered
his
hand
to
isabel
she
was
smiling
but
still
pale
and
her
eyes
in
spite
of
the
smile
kept
upon
george
in
a
shocked
anxiety
miss
fanny
had
already
mounted
to
the
rear
seat
and
george
after
helping
lucy
morgan
to
climb
up
beside
his
aunt
was
following
isabel
saw
that
his
shoes
were
light
things
of
patent
leather
and
that
snow
was
clinging
to
them
she
made
a
little
rush
toward
him
and
as
one
of
his
feet
rested
on
the
iron
step
of
the
machine
in
mounting
she
began
to
clean
the
snow
from
his
shoe
with
her
almost
aerial
lace
handkerchief
you
must
catch
cold
she
cried
stop
that
george
shouted
and
furiously
withdrew
his
foot
then
stamp
the
snow
off
she
begged
you
must
ride
with
wet
they
not
george
roared
thoroughly
outraged
for
heaven
sake
get
in
you
standing
in
the
snow
yourself
get
in
isabel
consented
turning
to
morgan
whose
habitual
expression
of
apprehensiveness
was
somewhat
accentuated
he
climbed
up
after
her
george
amberson
having
gone
to
the
other
side
you
the
same
isabel
i
used
to
know
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
a
divinely
ridiculous
am
i
eugene
she
said
not
displeased
and
just
counterbalance
each
other
do
they
plus
one
and
minus
one
equal
nothing
so
you
mean
i
nothing
in
particular
no
he
answered
tugging
at
a
lever
that
does
seem
to
be
precisely
what
i
meant
there
this
exclamation
referred
to
the
subterranean
machinery
for
dismaying
sounds
came
from
beneath
the
floor
and
the
vehicle
plunged
then
rolled
noisily
forward
behold
george
amberson
exclaimed
she
does
move
it
must
be
another
accident
morgan
shouted
over
the
din
no
she
breathes
she
stirs
she
seems
to
feel
a
thrill
of
life
along
her
keel
and
he
began
to
sing
the
star
spangled
amberson
joined
him
lustily
and
sang
on
when
morgan
stopped
the
twilight
sky
cleared
discovering
a
round
moon
already
risen
and
the
musical
congressman
hailed
this
bright
presence
with
the
complete
text
and
melody
of
the
danube
his
nephew
behind
was
gloomy
he
had
overheard
his
conversation
with
the
inventor
it
seemed
curious
to
him
that
this
morgan
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
until
last
night
should
be
using
the
name
isabel
so
easily
and
george
felt
that
it
was
not
just
the
thing
for
his
mother
to
call
morgan
eugene
the
resentment
of
the
previous
night
came
upon
george
again
meanwhile
his
mother
and
morgan
continued
their
talk
but
he
could
no
longer
hear
what
they
said
the
noise
of
the
car
and
his
uncle
songful
mood
prevented
he
marked
how
animated
isabel
seemed
it
was
not
strange
to
see
his
mother
so
gay
but
it
was
strange
that
a
man
not
of
the
family
should
be
the
cause
of
her
gaiety
and
george
sat
frowning
fanny
minafer
had
begun
to
talk
to
lucy
your
father
wanted
to
prove
that
his
horseless
carriage
would
run
even
in
the
snow
she
said
it
really
does
of
course
it
so
interesting
he
been
telling
us
how
he
going
to
change
it
he
says
he
going
to
have
wheels
all
made
of
rubber
and
blown
up
with
air
i
do
understand
what
he
means
at
all
i
should
think
explode
but
eugene
seems
to
be
very
confident
he
always
was
confident
though
it
seems
so
like
old
times
to
hear
him
talk
she
became
thoughtful
and
lucy
turned
to
george
you
tried
to
swing
underneath
me
and
break
the
fall
for
me
when
we
went
over
she
said
i
knew
you
were
doing
that
and
it
was
nice
of
was
any
fall
to
speak
of
he
returned
brusquely
could
have
hurt
either
of
still
it
was
friendly
of
you
and
awfully
quick
too
i
not
not
forget
it
her
voice
had
a
sound
of
genuineness
very
pleasant
and
george
began
to
forget
his
annoyance
with
her
father
this
annoyance
of
his
had
not
been
alleviated
by
the
circumstance
that
neither
of
the
seats
of
the
old
was
designed
for
three
people
but
when
his
neighbour
spoke
thus
gratefully
he
no
longer
minded
the
crowding
in
fact
it
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
began
to
wish
the
old
would
go
even
slower
and
she
had
spoken
no
word
of
blame
for
his
letting
that
darned
horse
get
the
cutter
into
the
ditch
george
presently
addressed
her
hurriedly
almost
tremulously
speaking
close
to
her
ear
i
forgot
to
tell
you
something
you
pretty
nice
i
thought
so
the
first
second
i
saw
you
last
night
i
come
for
you
tonight
and
take
you
to
the
assembly
at
the
amberson
hotel
you
going
are
you
yes
but
i
going
with
papa
and
the
sharons
i
see
you
looks
to
me
as
if
you
were
awfully
conventional
george
grumbled
and
his
disappointment
was
deeper
than
he
was
willing
to
let
her
see
though
she
probably
did
see
well
we
dance
the
cotillion
together
i
afraid
not
i
promised
what
george
tone
was
shocked
as
at
incredible
news
well
you
could
break
that
engagement
i
guess
if
you
wanted
to
girls
always
can
get
out
of
things
when
they
want
to
wo
you
i
do
think
why
not
because
i
promised
him
several
days
george
gulped
and
lowered
his
pride
i
do
oh
look
here
i
only
want
to
go
to
that
thing
tonight
to
get
to
see
something
of
you
and
if
you
do
dance
the
cotillion
with
me
how
can
i
i
only
be
here
two
weeks
and
the
others
have
got
all
the
rest
of
your
visit
to
see
you
wo
you
do
it
please
i
see
here
said
the
stricken
george
if
you
going
to
decline
to
dance
that
cotillion
with
me
simply
because
you
promised
a
a
a
miserable
outsider
like
fred
kinney
why
we
might
as
well
quit
quit
what
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
mean
he
said
huskily
i
well
you
ought
to
but
i
do
at
all
george
thoroughly
hurt
and
not
a
little
embittered
expressed
himself
in
a
short
outburst
of
laughter
well
i
ought
to
have
seen
it
seen
what
that
you
might
turn
out
to
be
a
girl
who
like
a
fellow
of
the
kinney
sort
i
ought
to
have
seen
it
from
the
first
lucy
bore
her
disgrace
lightly
oh
dancing
a
cotillion
with
a
person
does
mean
that
you
like
him
but
i
do
see
anything
in
particular
the
matter
with
kinney
what
is
if
you
do
see
anything
the
matter
with
him
for
yourself
george
responded
icily
i
do
think
pointing
it
out
would
help
you
you
probably
would
you
might
try
she
suggested
of
course
i
a
stranger
here
and
if
people
have
done
anything
wrong
or
have
something
unpleasant
about
them
i
would
have
any
way
of
knowing
it
just
at
first
if
poor
kinney
i
prefer
not
to
discuss
it
said
george
curtly
he
an
enemy
of
why
i
prefer
not
to
discuss
well
but
i
prefer
not
to
discuss
it
very
she
began
to
hum
the
air
of
the
song
which
george
amberson
was
now
discoursing
o
moon
of
my
delight
that
knows
no
wane
and
there
was
no
further
conversation
on
the
back
seat
they
had
entered
amberson
addition
and
the
moon
of
delight
was
overlaid
by
a
slender
gothic
filagree
the
branches
that
sprang
from
the
shade
trees
lining
the
street
through
the
windows
of
many
of
the
houses
rosy
lights
were
flickering
and
silver
tinsel
and
evergreen
wreaths
and
brilliant
little
glass
globes
of
silver
and
wine
colour
could
be
seen
and
glimpses
were
caught
of
christmas
trees
with
people
decking
them
by
firelight
reminders
that
this
was
christmas
eve
the
had
disappeared
from
the
highway
though
now
and
then
over
the
gasping
and
howling
of
the
horseless
carriage
there
came
a
shrill
jeer
from
some
young
upon
the
sidewalk
mister
fer
heaven
sake
go
an
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
git
a
hoss
the
contrivance
stopped
with
a
jerk
before
isabel
house
the
gentlemen
jumped
down
helping
isabel
and
fanny
to
descend
there
were
friendly
leavetakings
and
one
that
was
not
precisely
friendly
it
revoir
till
is
it
lucy
asked
laughing
good
afternoon
said
george
and
he
did
not
wait
as
his
relatives
did
to
see
the
old
sewing
machine
start
briskly
down
the
street
toward
the
sharons
its
lighter
load
consisting
now
of
only
morgan
and
his
daughter
george
went
into
the
house
at
once
he
found
his
father
reading
the
evening
paper
in
the
library
where
are
your
mother
and
your
aunt
fanny
minafer
inquired
not
looking
up
they
coming
said
his
son
and
casting
himself
heavily
into
a
chair
stared
at
the
fire
his
prediction
was
verified
a
few
moments
later
the
two
ladies
came
in
cheerfully
unfastening
their
fur
cloaks
it
all
right
georgie
said
isabel
your
uncle
george
called
to
us
that
pendennis
got
home
safely
put
your
shoes
close
to
the
fire
dear
or
else
go
and
change
she
went
to
her
husband
and
patted
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
an
action
which
george
watched
with
sombre
moodiness
you
might
dress
before
long
she
suggested
we
all
going
to
the
assembly
after
dinner
are
we
brother
george
said
he
go
with
look
here
said
george
abruptly
how
about
this
man
morgan
and
his
old
does
he
want
to
get
grandfather
to
put
money
into
it
is
he
trying
to
work
uncle
george
for
that
is
that
what
up
to
it
was
miss
fanny
who
responded
you
little
silly
she
cried
with
surprising
sharpness
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
eugene
morgan
perfectly
able
to
finance
his
own
inventions
these
i
bet
he
borrows
money
of
uncle
george
the
nephew
insisted
isabel
looked
at
him
in
grave
perplexity
why
do
you
say
such
a
thing
george
she
asked
he
strikes
me
as
that
sort
of
man
he
answered
doggedly
is
he
father
minafer
set
down
his
paper
for
the
moment
he
was
a
fairly
wild
young
fellow
twenty
years
ago
he
said
glancing
at
his
wife
absently
he
was
like
you
in
one
thing
georgie
he
spent
too
much
money
only
he
did
have
any
mother
to
get
money
out
of
a
grandfather
for
him
so
he
was
usually
in
debt
but
i
believe
i
heard
he
done
fairly
well
of
late
years
no
i
ca
say
i
think
he
a
swindler
and
i
doubt
if
he
needs
anybody
else
money
to
back
his
horseless
well
what
he
brought
the
old
thing
here
for
then
people
that
own
elephants
do
take
them
elephants
around
with
when
they
go
visiting
what
he
got
it
here
for
i
sure
i
do
know
said
minafer
resuming
his
paper
you
might
ask
isabel
laughed
and
patted
her
husband
shoulder
again
are
you
going
to
dress
are
we
all
going
to
the
dance
he
groaned
faintly
are
your
brother
and
georgie
escorts
enough
for
you
and
fanny
would
you
enjoy
it
at
all
you
know
i
isabel
let
her
hand
remain
upon
his
shoulder
a
moment
longer
she
stood
behind
him
looking
into
the
fire
and
george
watching
her
broodingly
thought
there
was
more
colour
in
her
face
than
the
reflection
of
the
flames
accounted
for
well
then
she
said
indulgently
stay
at
home
and
be
happy
we
wo
urge
you
if
you
really
rather
i
really
would
he
said
contentedly
half
an
hour
later
george
was
passing
through
the
upper
hall
in
a
stage
of
preparation
for
the
evening
gaieties
when
he
encountered
his
aunt
fanny
he
stopped
her
look
here
he
said
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
she
demanded
regarding
him
with
little
amiability
you
look
as
if
you
were
rehearsing
for
a
villain
in
a
play
do
change
your
expression
his
expression
gave
no
sign
of
yielding
to
the
request
on
the
contrary
its
somberness
deepened
i
suppose
you
do
know
why
father
want
to
go
tonight
he
said
solemnly
you
his
only
sister
and
yet
you
do
know
he
never
wants
to
go
anywhere
that
i
ever
heard
of
said
fanny
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
does
want
to
go
because
he
does
like
this
man
good
gracious
fanny
cried
impatiently
eugene
morgan
is
in
your
father
thoughts
at
all
one
way
or
the
other
why
should
he
be
george
hesitated
well
it
strikes
me
look
here
what
makes
you
and
and
everybody
so
excited
over
him
excited
she
jeered
ca
people
be
glad
to
see
an
old
friend
without
silly
children
like
you
having
to
make
a
about
it
just
been
in
your
mother
room
suggesting
that
she
might
give
a
little
dinner
for
them
for
who
for
whom
georgie
for
morgan
and
his
look
here
george
said
quickly
do
do
that
mother
must
do
that
it
would
look
would
look
well
fanny
mocked
him
and
her
suppressed
vehemence
betrayed
a
surprising
acerbity
see
here
georgie
minafer
i
suggest
that
you
just
march
straight
on
into
your
room
and
finish
your
dressing
sometimes
you
say
things
that
show
you
have
a
pretty
mean
little
mind
george
was
so
astounded
by
this
outburst
that
his
indignation
was
delayed
by
his
curiosity
why
what
upsets
you
this
way
he
inquired
i
know
what
you
mean
she
said
her
voice
still
lowered
but
not
decreasing
in
sharpness
you
trying
to
insinuate
that
i
get
your
mother
to
invite
eugene
morgan
here
on
my
account
because
he
a
widower
i
am
george
gasped
nonplussed
i
trying
to
insinuate
that
setting
your
cap
at
him
and
getting
mother
to
help
you
is
that
what
you
mean
beyond
a
doubt
that
was
what
miss
fanny
meant
she
gave
him
a
look
you
attend
to
your
own
affairs
she
whispered
fiercely
and
swept
away
george
dumfounded
returned
to
his
room
for
meditation
he
had
lived
for
years
in
the
same
house
with
his
aunt
fanny
and
it
now
appeared
that
during
all
those
years
he
had
been
thus
intimately
associating
with
a
total
stranger
never
before
had
he
met
the
passionate
lady
with
whom
he
had
just
held
a
conversation
in
the
hall
so
she
wanted
to
get
married
and
wanted
george
mother
to
help
her
with
this
widower
well
i
will
be
shot
he
muttered
aloud
i
will
i
certainly
will
be
shot
and
he
began
to
laugh
lord
but
presently
at
the
thought
of
the
daughter
his
grimness
returned
and
he
resolved
upon
a
line
of
conduct
for
the
evening
he
would
nod
to
her
carelessly
when
he
first
saw
her
and
after
that
he
would
notice
her
no
more
he
would
not
dance
with
her
he
would
not
favour
her
in
the
cotillion
he
would
not
go
near
her
he
descended
to
dinner
upon
the
third
urgent
summons
of
a
coloured
butler
having
spent
two
hours
dressing
and
rehearsing
chapter
ix
the
honourable
george
amberson
was
a
congressman
who
led
cotillions
the
sort
of
congressman
an
amberson
would
be
he
did
it
negligently
tonight
yet
with
infallible
dexterity
now
and
then
glancing
humorously
at
the
spectators
people
of
his
own
age
they
were
seated
in
a
tropical
grove
at
one
end
of
the
room
whither
they
had
retired
at
the
beginning
of
the
cotillion
which
they
surrendered
entirely
to
the
twenties
and
the
late
and
here
grouped
with
that
stately
pair
sydney
and
amelia
amberson
sat
isabel
with
fanny
while
eugene
morgan
appeared
to
bestow
an
amiable
devotion
impartially
upon
the
three
fanny
watched
his
face
eagerly
laughing
at
everything
he
said
amelia
smiled
blandly
but
rather
because
of
graciousness
than
because
of
interest
while
isabel
looking
out
at
the
dancers
rhythmically
moved
a
great
fan
of
blue
ostrich
feathers
listened
to
eugene
thoughtfully
yet
all
the
while
kept
her
shining
eyes
on
georgie
georgie
had
carried
out
his
rehearsed
projects
with
precision
he
had
given
miss
morgan
a
nod
studied
into
perfection
during
his
lengthy
toilet
before
dinner
oh
yes
i
do
seem
to
remember
that
curious
little
outsider
this
nod
seemed
to
say
thereafter
all
cognizance
of
her
evaporated
the
curious
little
outsider
was
permitted
no
further
existence
worth
the
struggle
nevertheless
she
flashed
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
too
often
he
was
aware
of
her
dancing
demurely
and
of
her
viciously
flirtatious
habit
of
never
looking
up
at
her
partner
but
keeping
her
eyes
concealed
beneath
downcast
lashes
and
he
had
consciousness
of
her
between
the
dances
though
it
was
not
possible
to
see
her
at
these
times
even
if
he
had
cared
to
look
frankly
in
her
direction
she
was
invisible
in
a
thicket
of
young
dresscoats
the
black
thicket
moved
as
she
moved
and
her
location
was
hatefully
apparent
even
if
he
had
not
heard
her
voice
laughing
from
the
thicket
it
was
annoying
how
her
voice
though
never
loud
pursued
him
no
matter
how
vociferous
were
other
voices
all
about
he
seemed
unable
to
prevent
himself
from
constantly
recognizing
hers
it
had
a
quaver
in
it
not
pathetic
rather
humorous
than
pathetic
a
quality
which
annoyed
him
to
the
point
of
rage
because
it
was
so
difficult
to
get
away
from
she
seemed
to
be
having
a
wonderful
time
an
unbearable
soreness
accumulated
in
his
chest
his
dislike
of
the
girl
and
her
conduct
increased
until
he
thought
of
leaving
this
sickening
assembly
and
going
home
to
bed
that
would
show
her
but
just
then
he
heard
her
laughing
and
decided
that
it
would
show
her
so
he
remained
when
the
young
couples
seated
themselves
in
chairs
against
the
walls
round
three
sides
of
the
room
for
the
cotillion
george
joined
a
group
clustering
about
the
doorway
youths
with
no
partners
yet
eligible
to
be
called
out
and
favoured
he
marked
that
his
uncle
placed
the
infernal
kinney
and
miss
morgan
as
the
leading
couple
in
the
first
chairs
at
the
head
of
the
line
upon
the
right
and
this
disloyalty
on
the
part
of
uncle
george
was
inexcusable
for
in
the
family
circle
the
nephew
had
often
expressed
his
opinion
of
fred
kinney
in
his
bitterness
george
uttered
a
significant
monosyllable
the
music
flourished
whereupon
kinney
miss
morgan
and
six
of
their
neighbours
rose
and
waltzed
knowingly
amberson
whistle
blew
then
the
eight
young
people
went
to
the
and
were
given
toys
and
trinkets
wherewith
to
delight
the
new
partners
it
was
now
their
privilege
to
select
around
the
walls
the
seated
in
this
ceremony
looked
rather
conscious
some
chattered
endeavouring
not
to
appear
expectant
some
tried
not
to
look
wistful
and
others
were
frankly
solemn
it
was
a
trying
moment
and
whoever
secured
a
favour
this
very
first
shot
might
consider
the
portents
happy
for
a
successful
evening
holding
their
twinkling
gewgaws
in
their
hands
those
about
to
bestow
honour
came
toward
the
seated
lines
where
expressions
became
feverish
two
of
the
approaching
girls
seemed
to
wander
not
finding
a
predetermined
object
in
sight
and
these
two
were
janie
sharon
and
her
cousin
lucy
at
this
george
amberson
minafer
conceiving
that
he
had
little
to
anticipate
from
either
turned
a
proud
back
upon
the
room
and
affected
to
converse
with
his
friend
charlie
johnson
the
next
moment
a
quick
little
figure
intervened
between
the
two
it
was
lucy
gaily
offering
a
silver
sleighbell
decked
with
white
ribbon
i
almost
could
find
you
she
cried
george
stared
took
her
hand
led
her
forth
in
silence
danced
with
her
she
seemed
content
not
to
talk
but
as
the
whistle
blew
signalling
that
this
episode
was
concluded
and
he
conducted
her
to
her
seat
she
lifted
the
little
bell
toward
him
you
have
taken
your
favour
supposed
to
pin
it
on
your
coat
she
said
do
you
want
it
if
you
insist
said
george
stiffly
and
he
bowed
her
into
her
chair
then
turned
and
walked
away
dropping
the
sleighbell
haughtily
into
his
trousers
pocket
the
figure
proceeded
to
its
conclusion
and
george
was
given
other
sleighbells
which
he
easily
consented
to
wear
upon
his
lapel
but
as
the
next
figure
he
strolled
with
a
bored
air
to
the
tropical
grove
where
sat
his
elders
and
seated
himself
beside
his
uncle
sydney
his
mother
leaned
across
miss
fanny
raising
her
voice
over
the
music
to
speak
to
him
georgie
nobody
will
be
able
to
see
you
here
you
not
be
favoured
you
ought
to
be
where
you
can
do
care
to
he
returned
bore
but
you
ought
she
stopped
and
laughed
waving
her
fan
to
direct
his
attention
behind
him
look
over
your
shoulder
he
turned
and
discovered
miss
lucy
morgan
in
the
act
of
offering
him
a
purple
toy
balloon
i
found
you
she
laughed
george
was
startled
well
he
said
would
you
rather
it
out
lucy
asked
quickly
as
he
did
not
move
i
do
care
to
dance
if
you
no
he
said
rising
it
would
be
better
to
his
tone
was
solemn
and
solemnly
he
departed
with
her
from
the
grove
solemnly
he
danced
with
her
four
times
with
not
the
slightest
encouragement
she
brought
him
a
favour
times
in
succession
when
the
fourth
came
look
here
said
george
huskily
you
going
to
keep
this
up
all
night
what
do
you
mean
by
it
for
an
instant
she
seemed
confused
that
what
cotillions
are
for
are
they
she
murmured
what
do
you
mean
what
they
for
so
that
a
girl
can
dance
with
a
person
she
wants
to
george
huskiness
increased
well
do
you
mean
you
you
want
to
dance
with
me
all
the
time
all
evening
well
this
much
of
it
evidently
she
laughed
is
it
because
you
thought
i
tried
to
keep
you
from
getting
hurt
this
afternoon
when
we
upset
she
shook
her
head
was
it
because
you
want
to
even
things
up
for
making
me
angry
i
mean
for
hurting
my
feelings
on
the
way
home
with
her
eyes
averted
for
girls
of
nineteen
can
be
as
shy
as
boys
sometimes
she
said
well
you
only
got
angry
because
i
could
dance
the
cotillion
with
you
i
i
did
feel
terribly
hurt
with
you
for
getting
angry
about
that
was
there
any
other
reason
did
my
telling
you
i
liked
you
have
anything
to
do
with
it
she
looked
up
gently
and
as
george
met
her
eyes
something
exquisitely
touching
yet
queerly
delightful
gave
him
a
catch
in
the
throat
she
looked
instantly
away
and
turning
ran
out
from
the
palm
grove
where
they
stood
to
the
come
on
she
cried
let
dance
he
followed
her
see
here
i
i
he
stammered
you
mean
do
you
no
no
she
laughed
let
dance
he
put
his
arm
about
her
almost
tremulously
and
they
began
to
waltz
it
was
a
happy
dance
for
both
of
them
christmas
day
is
the
children
but
the
holidays
are
the
holidays
belong
to
the
early
twenties
and
the
home
from
school
and
college
these
years
possess
the
holidays
for
a
little
while
then
possess
them
only
in
smiling
wistful
memories
of
holly
and
twinkling
lights
and
and
charming
faces
all
aglow
it
is
the
liveliest
time
in
life
the
happiest
of
the
irresponsible
times
in
life
mothers
echo
its
happiness
nothing
is
like
a
mother
who
has
a
son
home
from
college
except
another
mother
with
a
son
home
from
college
bloom
does
actually
come
upon
these
mothers
it
is
a
visible
thing
and
they
run
like
girls
walk
like
athletes
laugh
like
sycophants
yet
they
give
up
their
sons
to
the
daughters
of
other
mothers
and
find
it
proud
rapture
enough
to
be
allowed
to
sit
and
watch
thus
isabel
watched
george
and
lucy
dancing
as
together
they
danced
away
the
holidays
of
that
year
into
the
past
they
seem
to
get
along
better
than
they
did
at
first
those
two
children
fanny
minafer
said
sitting
beside
her
at
the
sharons
dance
a
week
after
the
assembly
they
seemed
to
be
always
having
little
quarrels
of
some
sort
at
first
at
least
george
did
he
seemed
to
be
continually
pecking
at
that
lovely
dainty
little
lucy
and
being
cross
with
her
over
pecking
isabel
laughed
what
a
word
to
use
about
georgie
i
think
i
never
knew
a
more
angelically
amiable
disposition
in
my
life
miss
fanny
echoed
her
laugh
but
it
was
a
rueful
echo
and
not
sweet
he
amiable
to
you
she
said
that
all
the
side
of
him
you
ever
happen
to
see
and
why
would
he
be
amiable
to
anybody
that
simply
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
every
minute
of
her
life
most
of
us
would
is
he
worth
worshipping
just
look
at
him
is
he
charming
with
lucy
see
how
hard
he
ran
to
get
it
when
she
dropped
her
handkerchief
back
oh
i
not
going
to
argue
with
you
about
george
said
miss
fanny
i
fond
enough
of
him
for
that
matter
he
can
be
charming
and
certainly
stunning
looking
if
only
let
the
only
go
dear
isabel
suggested
talk
about
that
dinner
you
thought
i
should
i
miss
fanny
interrupted
quickly
did
you
want
to
give
it
yourself
indeed
i
did
my
dear
said
isabel
heartily
i
only
meant
that
unless
you
had
proposed
it
perhaps
i
would
but
here
eugene
came
for
her
to
dance
and
she
left
the
sentence
uncompleted
holiday
dances
can
be
happy
for
youth
renewed
as
well
as
for
youth
in
bud
and
yet
it
was
not
with
the
air
of
a
rival
that
miss
fanny
watched
her
brother
wife
dancing
with
the
widower
miss
eyes
narrowed
a
little
but
only
as
if
her
mind
engaged
in
a
hopeful
calculation
she
looked
pleased
chapter
x
a
few
days
after
george
return
to
the
university
it
became
evident
that
not
quite
everybody
had
gazed
with
complete
benevolence
upon
the
various
young
collegians
at
their
holiday
sports
the
sunday
edition
of
the
principal
morning
paper
even
expressed
some
bitterness
under
the
heading
gilded
youths
of
the
this
was
considered
the
knowing
phrase
of
the
time
especially
for
sunday
supplements
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
from
certain
references
in
this
bit
of
writing
some
people
drew
the
conclusion
that
george
amberson
minafer
had
not
yet
got
his
comeuppance
a
postponement
still
irritating
undeniably
fanny
minafer
was
one
of
the
people
who
drew
this
conclusion
for
she
cut
the
article
out
and
enclosed
it
in
a
letter
to
her
nephew
having
written
on
the
border
of
the
clipping
i
wonder
whom
it
can
mean
george
read
part
of
it
we
debate
sometimes
what
is
to
be
the
future
of
this
nation
when
we
think
that
in
a
few
years
public
affairs
may
be
in
the
hands
of
the
gilded
youths
we
see
about
us
during
the
christmas
holidays
such
foppery
such
luxury
such
insolence
was
surely
never
practised
by
the
scented
overbearing
patricians
of
the
palatine
even
in
rome
most
decadent
epoch
in
all
the
wild
orgy
of
wastefulness
and
luxury
with
which
the
nineteenth
century
reaches
its
close
the
gilded
youth
has
been
surely
the
worst
symptom
with
his
airs
of
young
milord
his
fast
horses
his
gold
and
silver
his
clothes
from
a
new
york
tailor
his
recklessness
of
money
showered
upon
him
by
indulgent
mothers
or
doting
grandfathers
he
respects
nothing
and
nobody
he
is
blase
if
you
please
watch
him
at
a
social
function
how
condescendingly
he
deigns
to
select
a
partner
for
the
popular
waltz
or
two
step
how
carelessly
he
shoulders
older
people
out
of
his
way
with
what
a
blank
stare
he
returns
the
salutation
of
some
old
acquaintance
whom
he
may
choose
in
his
royal
whim
to
forget
the
unpleasant
part
of
all
this
is
that
the
young
women
he
so
condescendingly
selects
as
partners
for
the
dance
greet
him
with
seeming
rapture
though
in
their
hearts
they
must
feel
humiliated
by
his
languid
hauteur
and
many
older
people
beam
upon
him
almost
fawningly
if
he
unbends
so
far
as
to
throw
them
a
careless
disdainful
word
one
wonders
what
has
come
over
the
new
generation
of
such
as
these
the
republic
was
not
made
let
us
pray
that
the
future
of
our
country
is
not
in
the
hands
of
these
gilded
youths
but
rather
in
the
calloused
palms
of
young
men
yet
unknown
labouring
upon
the
farms
of
the
land
when
we
compare
the
young
manhood
of
abraham
lincoln
with
the
specimens
we
are
now
producing
we
see
too
well
that
it
bodes
ill
for
the
twentieth
century
george
yawned
and
tossed
the
clipping
into
his
wondering
why
his
aunt
thought
such
dull
nonsense
worth
the
sending
as
for
her
insinuation
pencilled
upon
the
border
he
supposed
she
meant
to
joke
a
supposition
which
neither
surprised
him
nor
altered
his
lifelong
opinion
of
her
wit
he
read
her
letter
with
more
interest
the
dinner
your
mother
gave
for
the
morgans
was
a
lovely
affair
it
was
last
monday
evening
just
ten
days
after
you
left
it
was
peculiarly
appropriate
that
your
mother
should
give
this
dinner
because
her
brother
george
your
uncle
was
morgan
most
intimate
friend
before
he
left
here
a
number
of
years
ago
and
it
was
a
pleasant
occasion
for
the
formal
announcement
of
some
news
which
you
heard
from
lucy
morgan
before
you
returned
to
college
at
least
she
told
me
she
had
told
you
the
night
before
you
left
that
her
father
had
decided
to
return
here
to
live
it
was
appropriate
that
your
mother
herself
an
old
friend
should
assemble
a
representative
selection
of
morgan
old
friends
around
him
at
such
a
time
he
was
in
great
spirits
and
most
entertaining
as
your
time
was
so
charmingly
taken
up
during
your
visit
home
with
a
younger
member
of
his
family
you
probably
overlooked
opportunities
of
hearing
him
talk
and
do
not
know
what
an
interesting
man
he
can
be
he
will
soon
begin
to
build
his
factory
here
for
the
manufacture
of
automobiles
which
he
says
is
a
term
he
prefers
to
horseless
your
uncle
george
told
me
he
would
like
to
invest
in
this
factory
as
george
thinks
there
is
a
future
for
automobiles
perhaps
not
for
general
use
but
as
an
interesting
novelty
which
people
with
sufficient
means
would
like
to
own
for
their
amusement
and
the
sake
of
variety
however
he
said
morgan
laughingly
declined
his
offer
as
was
fully
able
to
finance
this
venture
though
not
starting
in
a
very
large
way
your
uncle
said
other
people
are
manufacturing
automobiles
in
different
parts
of
the
country
with
success
your
father
is
not
very
well
though
he
is
not
actually
ill
and
the
doctor
tells
him
he
ought
not
to
be
so
much
at
his
office
as
the
long
years
of
application
indoors
with
no
exercise
are
beginning
to
affect
him
unfavourably
but
i
believe
your
father
would
die
if
he
had
to
give
up
his
work
which
is
all
that
has
ever
interested
him
outside
of
his
family
i
never
could
understand
it
morgan
took
your
mother
and
me
with
lucy
to
see
modjeska
in
twelfth
night
yesterday
evening
and
lucy
said
she
thought
the
duke
looked
rather
like
you
only
much
more
democratic
in
his
manner
i
suppose
you
will
think
i
have
written
a
great
deal
about
the
morgans
in
this
letter
but
thought
you
would
be
interested
because
of
your
interest
in
a
younger
member
of
his
family
hoping
that
you
are
finding
college
still
as
attractive
as
ever
affectionately
aunt
fanny
george
read
one
sentence
in
this
letter
several
times
then
he
dropped
the
missive
in
his
wastebasket
to
join
the
clipping
and
strolled
down
the
corridor
of
his
dormitory
to
borrow
a
copy
of
twelfth
having
secured
one
he
returned
to
his
study
and
refreshed
his
memory
of
the
play
but
received
no
enlightenment
that
enabled
him
to
comprehend
lucy
strange
remark
however
he
found
himself
impelled
in
the
direction
of
correspondence
and
presently
wrote
a
letter
not
a
reply
to
his
aunt
fanny
dear
lucy
no
doubt
you
will
be
surprised
at
hearing
from
me
so
soon
again
especially
as
this
makes
two
in
answer
to
the
one
received
from
you
since
getting
back
to
the
old
place
i
hear
you
have
been
making
comments
about
me
at
the
theatre
that
some
actor
was
more
democratic
in
his
manners
than
i
am
which
i
do
not
understand
you
know
my
theory
of
life
because
i
explained
it
to
you
on
our
first
drive
together
when
i
told
you
i
would
not
talk
to
everybody
about
things
i
feel
like
the
way
i
spoke
to
you
of
my
theory
of
life
i
believe
those
who
are
able
should
have
a
true
theory
of
life
and
i
developed
my
theory
of
life
long
long
ago
well
here
i
sit
smoking
my
faithful
briar
pipe
indulging
in
the
fragrance
of
my
tobacco
as
i
look
out
on
the
campus
from
my
window
and
things
are
different
with
me
from
the
way
they
were
way
back
in
freshman
year
i
can
see
now
how
boyish
in
many
ways
i
was
then
i
believe
what
has
changed
me
as
much
as
anything
was
my
visit
home
at
the
time
i
met
you
so
i
sit
here
with
my
faithful
briar
and
dream
the
old
dreams
over
as
it
were
dreaming
of
the
waltzes
we
waltzed
together
and
of
that
last
night
before
we
parted
and
you
told
me
the
good
news
you
were
going
to
live
there
and
i
would
find
my
friend
waiting
for
me
when
i
get
home
next
summer
i
will
be
glad
my
friend
will
be
waiting
for
me
i
am
not
capable
of
friendship
except
for
the
very
few
and
looking
back
over
my
life
i
remember
there
were
times
when
i
doubted
if
i
could
feel
a
great
friendship
for
anybody
especially
girls
i
do
not
take
a
great
interest
in
many
people
as
you
know
for
i
find
most
of
them
shallow
here
in
the
old
place
i
do
not
believe
in
being
with
every
tom
dick
and
harry
just
because
he
happens
to
be
a
classmate
any
more
than
i
do
at
home
where
i
have
always
been
careful
who
i
was
seen
with
largely
on
account
of
the
family
but
also
because
my
disposition
ever
since
my
boyhood
has
been
to
encourage
real
intimacy
from
but
the
few
what
are
you
reading
now
i
have
finished
both
henry
esmond
and
the
i
like
thackeray
because
he
is
not
trashy
and
because
he
writes
principally
of
nice
people
my
theory
of
literature
is
an
author
who
does
not
indulge
in
trashiness
writes
about
people
you
could
introduce
into
your
own
home
i
agree
with
my
uncle
sydney
as
i
once
heard
him
say
he
did
not
care
to
read
a
book
or
go
to
a
play
about
people
he
would
not
care
to
meet
at
his
own
dinner
table
i
believe
we
should
live
by
certain
standards
and
ideals
as
you
know
from
my
telling
you
my
theory
of
life
well
a
letter
is
no
place
for
deep
discussions
so
i
will
not
go
into
the
subject
from
several
letters
from
my
mother
and
one
from
aunt
fanny
i
hear
you
are
seeing
a
good
deal
of
the
family
since
i
left
i
hope
sometimes
you
think
of
the
member
who
is
absent
i
got
a
silver
frame
for
your
photograph
in
new
york
and
i
keep
it
on
my
desk
it
is
the
only
girl
photograph
i
ever
took
the
trouble
to
have
framed
though
as
i
told
you
frankly
i
have
had
any
number
of
other
photographs
yet
all
were
only
passing
fancies
and
oftentimes
i
have
questioned
in
years
past
if
i
was
capable
of
much
friendship
toward
the
feminine
sex
which
i
usually
found
shallow
until
our
own
friendship
began
when
i
look
at
your
photograph
i
say
to
myself
at
last
at
last
here
is
one
that
will
not
prove
my
faithful
briar
has
gone
out
i
will
have
to
rise
and
fill
it
then
once
more
in
the
fragrance
of
my
lady
nicotine
i
will
sit
and
dream
the
old
dreams
over
and
think
too
of
the
true
friend
at
home
awaiting
my
return
in
june
for
the
summer
vacation
friend
this
is
from
your
friend
george
anticipations
were
not
disappointed
when
he
came
home
in
june
his
friend
was
awaiting
him
at
least
she
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
again
that
for
a
few
minutes
after
their
first
encounter
she
was
a
little
breathless
and
a
great
deal
glowing
and
quiet
withal
their
sentimental
friendship
continued
though
sometimes
he
was
irritated
by
her
making
it
less
sentimental
than
he
did
and
sometimes
by
what
he
called
her
air
of
her
air
was
usually
in
truth
that
of
a
fond
but
amused
older
sister
and
george
did
not
believe
such
an
attitude
was
warranted
by
her
eight
months
of
seniority
lucy
and
her
father
were
living
at
the
amberson
hotel
while
morgan
got
his
small
built
in
a
western
outskirt
of
the
town
and
george
grumbled
about
the
shabbiness
and
the
look
of
the
hotel
though
it
was
still
the
best
in
the
place
of
he
remonstrated
with
his
grandfather
declaring
that
the
whole
amberson
estate
would
be
getting
and
if
things
taken
in
hand
pretty
he
urged
the
general
need
of
rebuilding
renovating
varnishing
and
lawsuits
but
the
major
declining
to
hear
him
out
interrupted
querulously
saying
that
he
had
enough
to
bother
him
without
any
advice
from
george
and
retired
to
his
library
going
so
far
as
to
lock
the
door
audibly
second
childhood
george
muttered
shaking
his
head
and
he
thought
sadly
that
the
major
had
not
long
to
live
however
this
surmise
depressed
him
for
only
a
moment
or
so
of
course
people
could
be
expected
to
live
forever
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
someone
in
charge
of
the
estate
who
would
let
it
get
to
looking
so
rusty
that
riffraff
dared
to
make
fun
of
it
for
george
had
lately
undergone
the
annoyance
of
calling
upon
the
morgans
in
the
rather
stuffy
red
velours
and
gilt
parlour
of
their
apartment
at
the
hotel
one
evening
when
frederick
kinney
also
was
a
caller
and
kinney
had
not
been
tactful
in
fact
though
he
adopted
a
humorous
tone
of
voice
in
expressing
his
sympathy
for
people
who
through
the
city
poverty
in
hotels
were
obliged
to
stay
at
the
amberson
kinney
intention
was
interpreted
by
the
other
visitor
as
not
at
all
humorous
but
on
the
contrary
personal
and
offensive
george
rose
abruptly
his
face
the
colour
of
wrath
miss
morgan
morgan
he
said
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
calling
at
some
other
time
when
a
more
courteous
sort
of
people
may
be
look
here
the
fred
burst
out
do
you
try
to
make
me
out
a
boor
george
minafer
i
was
hinting
anything
at
you
i
simply
forgot
all
about
your
grandfather
owning
this
old
building
do
you
try
to
put
me
in
the
light
of
a
boor
i
wo
but
george
walked
out
in
the
very
course
of
this
vehement
protest
and
it
was
necessarily
left
unfinished
kinney
remained
only
a
few
moments
after
george
departure
and
as
the
door
closed
upon
him
the
distressed
lucy
turned
to
her
father
she
was
plaintively
surprised
to
find
him
in
a
condition
of
immoderate
laughter
i
did
i
did
think
i
could
hold
out
he
gasped
and
after
choking
until
tears
came
to
his
eyes
felt
blindly
for
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
to
wish
kinney
an
indistinct
his
hand
found
the
arm
of
the
chair
he
collapsed
feebly
and
sat
uttering
incoherent
sounds
papa
it
brings
things
back
so
he
managed
to
explain
this
very
fred
kinney
father
and
young
george
father
wilbur
minafer
used
to
do
just
such
things
when
they
were
at
that
age
and
for
that
matter
so
did
george
amberson
and
i
and
all
the
rest
of
us
and
in
spite
of
his
exhaustion
he
began
to
imitate
do
you
try
to
put
me
in
the
light
of
a
boor
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
calling
at
some
time
when
a
more
courteous
sort
of
people
he
was
unable
to
go
on
there
is
a
mirth
for
every
age
and
lucy
failed
to
comprehend
her
father
but
tolerated
it
a
little
ruefully
papa
i
think
they
were
shocking
were
they
awful
just
just
boys
he
moaned
wiping
his
eyes
but
lucy
could
not
smile
at
all
she
was
beginning
to
look
indignant
i
can
forgive
that
poor
fred
kinney
she
said
he
just
blundering
but
george
oh
george
behaved
outrageously
it
a
difficult
age
her
father
observed
his
calmness
somewhat
restored
girls
do
seem
to
have
to
pass
through
it
quite
as
boys
do
or
their
savoir
faire
is
instinctive
or
something
and
he
gave
away
to
a
return
of
his
convulsion
she
came
and
sat
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
papa
why
should
george
behave
like
that
he
rather
but
why
is
he
he
does
anything
he
likes
to
without
any
regard
for
what
people
think
then
why
should
he
mind
so
furiously
when
the
least
little
thing
reflects
upon
him
or
on
anything
or
anybody
connected
with
him
eugene
patted
her
hand
that
one
of
the
greatest
puzzles
of
human
vanity
dear
and
i
do
pretend
to
know
the
answer
in
all
my
life
the
most
arrogant
people
that
i
known
have
been
the
most
sensitive
the
people
who
have
done
the
most
in
contempt
of
other
people
opinion
and
who
consider
themselves
the
highest
above
it
have
been
the
most
furious
if
it
went
against
them
arrogant
and
domineering
people
stand
the
least
lightest
faintest
breath
of
criticism
it
just
kills
papa
do
you
think
george
is
arrogant
and
domineering
oh
he
still
only
a
boy
said
eugene
consolingly
there
plenty
of
fine
stuff
in
him
ca
help
but
be
because
he
isabel
lucy
stroked
his
hair
which
was
still
almost
as
dark
as
her
own
you
liked
her
pretty
well
once
i
guess
i
do
still
he
said
quietly
she
lovely
lovely
papa
she
paused
then
continued
i
wonder
sometimes
what
i
wonder
just
how
she
happened
to
marry
oh
minafer
all
right
said
eugene
he
a
quiet
sort
of
man
but
he
a
good
man
and
a
kind
man
he
always
was
and
those
things
but
in
a
way
well
i
heard
people
say
there
was
anything
to
him
at
all
except
business
and
saving
money
miss
fanny
minafer
herself
told
me
that
everything
george
and
his
mother
have
of
their
own
that
is
just
to
spend
as
they
like
she
says
it
has
always
come
from
major
thrift
horatio
said
eugene
lightly
thrift
an
inheritance
and
a
common
enough
one
here
the
people
who
settled
the
country
had
to
save
so
making
and
saving
were
taught
as
virtues
and
the
people
to
the
third
generation
have
found
out
that
making
and
saving
are
only
means
to
an
end
minafer
does
believe
in
money
being
spent
he
believes
god
made
it
to
be
invested
and
but
george
is
saving
he
reckless
and
even
if
he
is
arrogant
and
conceited
and
he
awfully
oh
he
an
amberson
said
her
father
the
ambersons
are
saving
they
too
much
the
other
way
most
of
i
do
think
i
should
have
called
george
lucy
said
thoughtfully
no
i
do
think
he
only
when
he
cross
about
something
morgan
suggested
with
a
semblance
of
sympathetic
gravity
yes
she
said
brightly
not
perceiving
that
his
intention
was
humorous
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
really
very
amiable
of
course
he
much
more
a
perfect
child
the
whole
time
than
he
realizes
he
certainly
behaved
awfully
she
jumped
up
her
indignation
returning
he
did
indeed
and
it
wo
do
to
encourage
him
in
it
i
think
he
find
me
pretty
cool
for
a
week
or
so
whereupon
her
father
suffered
a
renewal
of
his
attack
of
uproarious
laughter
chapter
xi
in
the
matter
of
coolness
george
met
lucy
upon
her
own
predetermined
ground
in
fact
he
was
there
first
and
at
their
next
encounter
proved
loftier
and
more
formal
than
she
did
their
estrangement
lasted
three
weeks
and
then
disappeared
without
any
preliminary
treaty
it
had
worn
itself
out
and
they
forgot
it
at
times
however
george
found
other
disturbances
to
the
friendship
lucy
was
too
much
the
village
belle
he
complained
and
took
a
satiric
attitude
toward
his
competitors
referring
to
them
as
her
local
swains
and
bumpkins
sulking
for
an
afternoon
when
she
reminded
him
that
he
too
was
at
least
she
was
a
belle
with
older
people
as
well
isabel
and
fanny
were
continually
taking
her
driving
bringing
her
home
with
them
to
lunch
or
dinner
and
making
a
hundred
little
engagements
with
her
and
the
major
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
insisting
upon
her
presence
and
her
father
at
the
amberson
family
dinner
at
the
mansion
every
sunday
evening
she
knew
how
to
flirt
with
old
people
he
said
as
she
sat
next
him
at
the
table
on
one
of
these
sunday
occasions
and
he
had
always
liked
her
father
even
when
eugene
was
a
terror
long
ago
oh
yes
he
was
the
major
laughed
when
she
remonstrated
he
came
up
here
with
my
son
george
and
some
others
for
a
serenade
one
night
and
eugene
stepped
into
a
bass
fiddle
and
the
poor
musicians
just
gave
up
i
had
a
pretty
getting
my
son
george
upstairs
i
remember
it
was
the
last
time
eugene
ever
touched
a
drop
but
touched
plenty
before
that
young
lady
and
he
dare
deny
it
well
well
there
another
thing
that
changed
hardly
anybody
drinks
nowadays
perhaps
it
just
as
well
but
things
used
to
be
livelier
that
serenade
was
just
before
isabel
was
married
and
do
you
fret
miss
lucy
your
father
remembers
it
well
enough
the
old
gentleman
burst
into
laughter
and
shook
his
finger
at
eugene
across
the
table
the
fact
is
the
major
went
on
hilariously
i
believe
if
eugene
had
broken
that
bass
fiddle
and
given
himself
away
isabel
would
never
have
taken
wilbur
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
was
about
all
the
reason
that
wilbur
got
her
what
do
you
think
wilbur
i
should
be
surprised
said
wilbur
placidly
if
your
notion
is
right
i
glad
broke
the
fiddle
he
was
giving
me
a
hard
run
the
major
always
drank
three
glasses
of
champagne
at
his
sunday
dinner
and
he
was
finishing
the
third
what
do
you
say
about
it
isabel
by
jove
he
cried
pounding
the
table
she
blushing
isabel
did
blush
but
she
laughed
who
would
blush
she
cried
and
her
came
to
her
assistance
the
important
thing
said
fanny
jovially
is
that
wilbur
did
get
her
and
not
only
got
her
but
kept
her
eugene
was
as
pink
as
isabel
but
he
laughed
without
any
sign
of
embarrassment
other
than
his
heightened
colour
there
another
important
thing
that
is
for
me
he
said
it
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
forgive
that
bass
viol
for
getting
in
my
what
is
it
the
major
asked
lucy
said
morgan
gently
isabel
gave
him
a
quick
glance
all
warm
approval
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
friendliness
round
the
table
george
was
not
one
of
those
who
joined
in
this
applause
he
considered
his
grandfather
nonsense
indelicate
even
for
second
childhood
and
he
thought
that
the
sooner
the
subject
was
dropped
the
better
however
he
had
only
a
slight
recurrence
of
the
resentment
which
had
assailed
him
during
the
winter
at
every
sign
of
his
mother
interest
in
morgan
though
he
was
still
ashamed
of
his
aunt
sometimes
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
fanny
was
almost
publicly
throwing
herself
at
the
widower
head
fanny
and
he
had
one
or
two
arguments
in
which
her
fierceness
again
astonished
and
amused
him
you
drop
your
criticisms
of
your
relatives
she
bade
him
hotly
one
day
and
begin
thinking
a
little
about
your
own
behaviour
you
say
people
will
about
my
about
my
merely
being
pleasant
to
an
old
friend
what
do
i
care
how
they
talk
i
guess
if
people
are
talking
about
anybody
in
this
family
they
talking
about
the
impertinent
little
snippet
that
has
any
respect
for
anything
and
does
even
know
enough
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
snippet
aunt
fanny
george
laughed
how
elegant
and
snippet
when
i
over
i
said
it
she
snapped
departing
i
do
see
how
lucy
can
stand
you
you
make
an
amiable
he
called
after
her
i
be
careful
about
proposing
to
lucy
these
were
but
roughish
spots
in
a
summer
that
glided
by
evenly
and
quickly
enough
for
the
most
part
and
at
the
end
seemed
to
fly
on
the
last
night
before
george
went
back
to
be
a
junior
his
mother
asked
him
confidently
if
it
had
not
been
a
happy
summer
he
had
thought
about
it
he
answered
oh
i
suppose
so
why
i
just
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
you
say
so
she
said
smiling
i
mean
it
pleasant
for
people
of
my
age
to
know
that
people
of
your
age
realize
that
they
people
of
your
age
he
repeated
you
know
you
do
look
precisely
like
an
old
woman
mother
not
precisely
no
she
said
and
i
suppose
i
feel
about
as
young
as
you
do
inside
but
it
wo
be
many
years
before
i
must
begin
to
look
old
it
does
come
she
sighed
still
smiling
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
have
been
a
happy
summer
for
you
a
real
of
roses
and
wine
without
the
wine
perhaps
ye
roses
while
ye
may
or
was
it
primroses
time
does
really
fly
or
perhaps
it
more
like
the
sky
and
smoke
george
was
puzzled
what
do
you
mean
time
being
like
the
sky
and
smoke
i
mean
the
things
that
we
have
and
that
we
think
are
so
solid
like
smoke
and
time
is
like
the
sky
that
the
smoke
disappears
into
you
know
how
wreath
of
smoke
goes
up
from
a
chimney
and
seems
all
thick
and
black
and
busy
against
the
sky
as
if
it
were
going
to
do
such
important
things
and
last
forever
and
you
see
it
getting
thinner
and
thinner
and
then
in
such
a
little
while
it
is
there
at
all
nothing
is
left
but
the
sky
and
the
sky
keeps
on
being
just
the
same
it
strikes
me
you
getting
mixed
up
said
george
cheerfully
i
do
see
much
resemblance
between
time
and
the
sky
or
between
things
and
but
i
do
see
one
reason
you
like
morgan
so
much
she
talks
that
same
kind
of
wistful
moony
way
sometimes
i
mean
to
say
i
mind
it
in
either
of
you
because
i
rather
like
to
listen
to
it
and
you
got
a
very
good
voice
mother
it
nice
to
listen
to
no
matter
how
much
smoke
and
sky
and
so
on
you
talk
so
lucy
for
that
matter
and
i
see
why
you
congenial
she
talks
that
way
to
her
father
too
and
he
right
there
with
the
same
kind
of
guff
well
all
right
with
me
he
laughed
teasingly
and
allowed
her
to
retain
his
hand
which
she
had
fondly
seized
i
got
plenty
to
think
about
when
people
drool
along
she
pressed
his
hand
to
her
cheek
and
a
tear
made
a
tiny
warm
streak
across
one
of
his
knuckles
for
heaven
sake
he
said
what
the
matter
is
everything
all
right
you
going
away
well
i
coming
back
do
you
suppose
is
that
all
that
worries
you
she
cheered
up
and
smiled
again
but
shook
her
head
i
never
can
bear
to
see
you
go
that
the
most
of
it
i
a
little
bothered
about
your
father
why
it
seems
to
me
he
looks
so
badly
everybody
thinks
what
nonsense
george
laughed
he
been
looking
that
way
all
summer
he
is
much
different
from
the
way
he
looked
all
his
life
that
i
can
see
what
the
matter
with
him
he
never
talks
much
about
his
business
to
me
but
i
think
he
been
worrying
about
some
investments
he
made
last
year
i
think
his
worry
has
affected
his
what
investments
george
demanded
he
has
gone
into
automobile
concern
has
he
no
isabel
smiled
the
concern
is
all
eugene
and
so
small
i
understand
it
taken
hardly
anything
no
your
father
has
always
prided
himself
on
making
only
the
most
absolutely
safe
investments
but
two
or
three
years
ago
he
and
your
uncle
george
both
put
a
great
deal
pretty
much
everything
they
could
get
together
i
think
into
the
stock
of
some
friends
of
theirs
owned
and
i
afraid
the
mills
have
been
doing
what
of
that
father
need
worry
you
and
i
could
take
care
of
him
the
rest
of
his
life
on
what
grandfather
of
course
she
agreed
but
your
father
always
lived
so
for
his
business
and
taken
such
pride
in
his
sound
investments
it
a
passion
with
him
i
pshaw
he
need
worry
you
tell
him
we
look
after
him
we
build
him
a
little
stone
bank
in
the
backyard
if
he
busts
up
and
he
can
go
and
put
his
pennies
in
it
every
morning
that
keep
him
just
as
happy
as
he
ever
was
he
kissed
her
i
going
to
tell
lucy
do
sit
up
for
she
walked
to
the
front
gate
with
him
still
holding
his
hand
and
he
told
her
again
not
to
sit
up
for
him
yes
i
will
she
laughed
you
wo
be
very
well
it
my
last
but
i
know
lucy
and
she
knows
i
want
to
see
you
too
your
last
night
you
see
she
send
you
home
promptly
at
eleven
but
she
was
mistaken
lucy
sent
him
home
promptly
at
ten
chapter
xii
isabels
uneasiness
about
her
husbands
health
sometimes
reflected
in
her
letters
to
george
during
the
winter
that
followed
had
not
been
alleviated
when
the
accredited
senior
returned
for
his
next
summer
vacation
and
she
confided
to
him
in
his
room
soon
after
his
arrival
that
something
the
doctor
had
said
to
her
lately
had
made
her
more
uneasy
than
ever
still
worrying
over
his
investments
george
asked
not
seriously
impressed
i
afraid
it
past
that
stage
from
what
dr
rainey
says
his
worries
only
aggravate
his
condition
now
rainey
says
we
ought
to
get
him
well
let
do
it
he
wo
he
a
man
awfully
set
in
his
ways
that
true
said
george
i
think
there
anything
much
the
matter
with
him
though
and
he
looks
just
the
same
to
me
have
you
seen
lucy
lately
how
is
she
has
she
written
you
oh
about
once
a
month
he
answered
carelessly
never
says
much
about
herself
how
she
look
she
looks
pretty
said
isabel
i
suppose
she
wrote
you
moved
yes
i
got
her
address
she
said
they
were
they
did
it
all
finished
and
they
been
in
it
a
month
lucy
is
so
capable
she
keeps
house
exquisitely
it
small
but
oh
such
a
pretty
little
house
well
that
fortunate
george
said
one
thing
i
always
felt
they
did
know
a
great
deal
about
is
do
they
asked
isabel
surprised
anyhow
their
house
is
charming
it
way
out
beyond
the
end
of
amberson
boulevard
it
quite
near
that
big
white
house
with
a
roof
somebody
built
out
there
a
year
or
so
ago
there
are
any
number
of
houses
going
up
out
that
way
and
the
runs
within
a
block
of
them
now
on
the
next
street
and
the
traction
people
are
laying
tracks
more
than
three
miles
beyond
i
suppose
you
be
driving
out
to
see
lucy
i
thought
george
hesitated
i
thought
perhaps
i
go
after
dinner
this
at
this
his
mother
laughed
not
astonished
it
was
only
my
feeble
joke
about
georgie
i
was
pretty
sure
you
could
wait
that
long
did
lucy
write
you
about
the
factory
no
what
factory
the
automobile
shops
they
had
rather
a
dubious
time
at
first
afraid
and
some
of
eugene
experiments
turned
out
badly
but
this
spring
they
finished
eight
automobiles
and
sold
them
all
and
got
twelve
more
almost
finished
and
they
sold
already
eugene
so
gay
over
it
what
do
his
old
look
like
like
that
first
one
he
had
when
they
came
here
no
indeed
these
have
rubber
tires
blown
up
with
air
pneumatic
and
they
are
so
high
they
very
easy
to
get
into
and
the
in
front
eugene
thinks
that
a
great
improvement
they
very
interesting
to
look
at
behind
the
driver
seat
there
a
sort
of
box
where
four
people
can
sit
with
a
step
and
a
little
door
in
the
rear
and
i
know
all
about
it
said
george
i
seen
any
number
like
that
east
you
can
see
all
you
want
of
if
you
stand
on
fifth
avenue
half
an
hour
any
afternoon
i
seen
go
by
almost
at
the
same
time
within
a
few
minutes
anyhow
and
of
course
electric
hansoms
are
a
common
sight
there
any
day
i
hired
one
myself
the
last
time
i
was
there
how
fast
do
morgan
machines
go
much
too
fast
it
very
exhilarating
but
rather
frightening
and
they
do
make
a
fearful
uproar
he
says
though
he
thinks
he
sees
a
way
to
get
around
the
noisiness
in
i
do
mind
the
noise
said
george
give
me
a
horse
for
mine
though
any
day
i
must
get
up
a
race
with
one
of
these
things
pendennis
leave
it
one
mile
behind
in
a
run
grandfather
he
looks
well
but
he
complains
sometimes
of
his
heart
i
suppose
that
natural
at
his
age
and
it
an
amberson
having
mentioned
this
she
looked
anxious
instantly
did
you
ever
feel
any
weakness
there
georgie
no
he
laughed
are
you
sure
dear
no
and
he
laughed
again
did
you
oh
i
think
not
at
least
the
doctor
told
me
he
thought
my
heart
was
about
all
right
he
said
i
need
be
i
should
think
not
women
do
seem
to
be
always
talking
about
health
i
suppose
they
have
got
enough
else
to
think
of
that
must
be
it
she
said
gayly
we
an
idle
lot
george
had
taken
off
his
coat
i
do
like
to
hint
to
a
lady
he
said
but
i
do
want
to
dress
before
do
be
long
i
got
to
do
a
lot
of
looking
at
you
dear
she
kissed
him
and
ran
away
singing
but
his
aunt
fanny
was
not
so
fond
and
at
the
there
came
a
spark
of
liveliness
into
her
eye
when
george
patronizingly
asked
her
what
was
the
news
in
her
own
particular
line
of
what
do
you
mean
georgie
she
asked
quietly
oh
i
mean
what
the
news
in
the
fast
set
generally
you
been
causing
any
divorces
lately
no
said
fanny
the
spark
in
her
eye
getting
brighter
i
have
been
causing
well
what
the
gossip
you
usually
hear
pretty
much
everything
that
goes
on
around
the
nooks
and
crannies
in
this
town
i
hear
what
the
last
from
the
gossips
corner
auntie
fanny
dropped
her
eyes
and
the
spark
was
concealed
but
a
movement
of
her
lower
lip
betokened
a
tendency
to
laugh
as
she
replied
there
has
been
much
gossip
lately
except
the
report
that
lucy
morgan
and
fred
kinney
are
engaged
and
that
quite
old
by
this
undeniably
this
bit
of
mischief
was
entirely
successful
for
there
was
a
clatter
upon
george
plate
what
what
do
you
think
you
talking
about
he
gasped
miss
fanny
looked
up
innocently
about
the
report
of
lucy
engagement
to
fred
george
turned
dumbly
to
his
mother
and
isabel
shook
her
head
reassuringly
people
are
always
starting
rumours
she
said
i
paid
any
attention
to
this
but
you
you
heard
it
he
stammered
oh
one
hears
all
sorts
of
nonsense
dear
i
have
the
slightest
idea
that
it
then
you
have
heard
it
i
would
let
it
take
my
appetite
his
father
suggested
drily
there
are
plenty
of
girls
in
the
world
george
turned
pale
eat
your
dinner
georgie
his
aunt
said
sweetly
food
will
do
you
good
i
did
say
i
knew
this
rumour
was
true
i
only
said
i
heard
when
when
did
you
hear
it
oh
months
ago
and
fanny
found
any
further
postponement
of
laughter
impossible
fanny
you
a
creature
isabel
said
gently
you
really
are
do
pay
any
attention
to
her
george
fred
kinney
only
a
clerk
in
his
uncle
hardware
place
he
could
marry
for
ages
even
if
anybody
would
accept
him
george
breathed
tumultuously
i
do
care
anything
about
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
he
said
his
thoughts
appearing
to
be
somewhat
disconnected
ages
do
mean
anything
i
only
want
to
know
i
want
to
know
i
want
he
stopped
what
do
you
want
his
father
asked
crossly
why
do
you
say
it
do
make
such
a
i
not
not
at
all
george
declared
pushing
his
chair
back
from
the
table
you
must
finish
your
dinner
dear
his
mother
urged
do
i
have
finished
i
eaten
all
i
want
i
do
want
any
more
than
i
wanted
i
do
want
i
he
rose
still
incoherent
i
prefer
i
want
please
excuse
me
he
left
the
room
and
a
moment
later
the
screens
outside
the
open
front
door
were
heard
to
slam
fanny
you
should
isabel
do
reproach
me
he
did
have
plenty
of
dinner
and
i
only
told
the
truth
everybody
has
been
saying
but
there
is
any
truth
in
we
do
actually
know
there
is
miss
fanny
insisted
giggling
we
never
asked
i
would
ask
her
anything
so
absurd
george
would
george
father
remarked
that
what
he
gone
to
minafer
was
not
mistaken
that
was
what
his
son
had
gone
to
do
lucy
and
her
father
were
just
rising
from
their
dinner
table
when
the
stirred
youth
arrived
at
the
front
door
of
the
new
house
it
was
a
cottage
however
rather
than
a
house
and
lucy
had
taken
a
free
hand
with
the
architect
achieving
results
in
white
and
green
outside
and
white
and
blue
inside
to
such
effect
of
youth
and
daintiness
that
her
father
complained
of
too
much
the
whole
place
including
his
own
bedroom
was
a
young
damsel
boudoir
he
said
so
that
nowhere
could
he
smoke
a
cigar
without
feeling
like
a
ruffian
however
he
was
smoking
when
george
arrived
and
he
encouraged
george
to
join
him
in
the
pastime
but
the
caller
whose
air
was
both
tense
and
preoccupied
declined
with
something
like
agitation
i
never
smoke
that
is
i
seldom
i
mean
no
thanks
he
said
i
mean
not
at
all
i
rather
are
you
well
george
eugene
asked
looking
at
him
in
perplexity
have
you
been
overworking
at
college
you
do
look
rather
pa
i
do
work
said
george
i
mean
i
do
work
i
think
but
i
work
i
only
work
at
the
end
of
the
term
there
is
much
to
eugene
perplexity
was
little
decreased
and
a
tinkle
of
the
afforded
him
obvious
relief
it
my
foreman
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
i
take
him
out
in
the
yard
to
talk
this
is
no
place
for
a
and
he
departed
leaving
the
living
room
to
lucy
and
george
it
was
a
pretty
room
white
panelled
and
blue
curtained
and
no
place
for
a
foreman
as
eugene
said
there
was
a
grand
piano
and
lucy
stood
leaning
back
against
it
looking
intently
at
george
while
her
fingers
behind
her
absently
struck
a
chord
or
two
and
her
dress
was
the
dress
for
that
room
being
of
blue
and
white
too
and
the
high
colour
in
her
cheeks
was
far
from
interfering
with
the
general
harmony
of
things
george
saw
with
dismay
that
she
was
prettier
than
ever
and
naturally
he
missed
the
reassurance
he
might
have
felt
had
he
been
able
to
guess
that
lucy
on
her
part
was
finding
him
better
looking
than
ever
for
however
unusual
the
scope
of
george
pride
vanity
of
beauty
was
not
included
he
did
not
think
about
his
looks
what
wrong
george
she
asked
softly
what
do
you
mean
wrong
you
awfully
upset
about
something
did
you
get
though
your
examination
all
right
certainly
i
did
what
makes
you
think
anything
with
me
you
do
look
pale
as
papa
said
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
way
you
talked
sounded
well
a
little
confused
i
said
i
did
care
to
smoke
what
in
the
world
is
confused
about
that
nothing
but
see
here
george
stepped
close
to
her
are
you
glad
to
see
me
you
need
be
so
fierce
about
it
lucy
protested
laughing
at
his
dramatic
intensity
of
course
i
am
how
long
have
i
been
looking
forward
to
it
i
do
know
he
said
sharply
abating
nothing
of
his
fierceness
how
long
have
you
why
ever
since
you
went
away
is
that
true
lucy
is
that
true
you
are
funny
she
said
of
course
it
true
do
tell
me
what
the
matter
with
you
george
i
will
he
exclaimed
i
was
a
boy
when
i
saw
you
last
i
see
that
now
though
i
did
then
well
i
not
a
boy
any
longer
i
a
man
and
a
man
has
a
right
to
demand
a
totally
different
why
has
he
what
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
understand
you
at
all
george
why
a
boy
be
treated
just
as
well
as
a
man
george
seemed
to
find
himself
at
a
loss
why
should
well
he
should
because
a
man
has
a
right
to
certain
what
explanations
whether
he
been
made
a
toy
of
george
almost
shouted
that
what
i
want
to
know
lucy
shook
her
head
despairingly
you
are
the
queerest
person
you
say
you
a
man
now
but
you
talk
more
like
a
boy
than
ever
what
does
make
you
so
excited
he
stormed
do
you
dare
to
stand
there
and
call
me
i
tell
you
i
never
have
been
more
calm
or
calmer
in
my
life
i
do
know
that
a
person
needs
to
be
called
because
he
demands
explanations
that
are
his
simple
due
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
me
to
explain
your
conduct
with
fred
kinney
george
shouted
lucy
uttered
a
sudden
cry
of
laughter
she
was
delighted
it
been
awful
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
ever
heard
of
worse
misbehaviour
papa
and
i
have
been
twice
to
dinner
with
his
family
and
i
been
three
times
to
church
with
fred
and
once
to
the
circus
i
do
know
when
they
be
here
to
arrest
me
stop
that
george
commanded
fiercely
i
want
to
know
just
one
thing
and
i
mean
to
know
it
too
whether
i
enjoyed
the
circus
i
want
to
know
if
you
engaged
to
him
no
she
cried
and
lifting
her
face
close
to
his
for
the
shortest
instant
possible
she
gave
him
a
look
half
merry
half
defiant
but
all
fond
it
was
an
adorable
look
lucy
he
said
huskily
but
she
turned
quickly
from
him
and
ran
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
followed
awkwardly
stammering
lucy
i
want
i
want
to
ask
you
will
you
will
you
will
you
be
engaged
to
me
she
stood
at
a
window
seeming
to
look
out
into
the
summer
darkness
her
back
to
him
will
you
lucy
no
she
murmured
just
audibly
why
not
i
older
than
eight
months
you
too
is
that
he
said
gulping
is
that
the
only
reason
you
wo
she
did
not
answer
as
she
stood
persistently
staring
out
of
the
window
with
her
back
to
him
she
did
not
see
how
humble
his
attitude
had
become
but
his
voice
was
low
and
it
shook
so
that
she
could
have
no
doubt
of
his
emotion
lucy
please
forgive
me
for
making
such
a
row
he
said
thus
gently
i
been
i
been
terribly
upset
terribly
you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
and
always
have
felt
about
you
i
shown
it
in
every
single
thing
i
done
since
the
first
time
i
met
you
and
i
know
you
know
it
do
you
still
she
did
not
move
or
speak
is
the
only
reason
you
wo
be
engaged
to
me
you
think
i
too
young
lucy
it
it
reason
enough
she
said
faintly
at
that
he
caught
one
of
her
hands
and
she
turned
to
him
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
tears
which
he
did
not
understand
at
all
lucy
you
little
dear
he
cried
i
knew
you
no
no
she
said
and
she
pushed
him
away
withdrawing
her
hand
george
let
not
talk
of
solemn
solemn
things
like
what
like
being
but
george
had
become
altogether
jubilant
and
he
laughed
triumphantly
good
gracious
that
is
solemn
it
is
too
she
said
wiping
her
eyes
it
too
solemn
for
no
it
is
i
let
sit
down
and
be
sensible
dear
she
said
you
sit
over
there
i
will
if
you
call
me
no
she
said
i
only
call
you
that
once
again
this
summer
the
night
before
you
go
that
will
have
to
do
then
he
laughed
so
long
as
i
know
but
we
not
she
protested
and
we
never
will
be
if
you
promise
not
to
speak
of
it
again
until
until
i
tell
you
to
i
wo
promise
that
said
the
happy
george
i
only
promise
not
to
speak
of
it
till
the
next
time
you
call
me
and
you
promised
to
call
me
that
the
night
before
i
leave
for
my
senior
oh
but
i
did
she
said
earnestly
then
hesitated
did
i
did
you
i
do
think
i
meant
it
she
murmured
her
wet
lashes
flickering
above
troubled
eyes
i
know
one
thing
about
you
he
said
gayly
his
triumph
increasing
you
never
went
back
on
anything
you
said
yet
and
i
not
afraid
of
this
being
the
first
time
but
we
must
let
she
faltered
then
went
on
tremulously
george
we
got
on
so
well
together
we
wo
let
this
make
a
difference
between
us
will
we
and
she
joined
in
his
laughter
it
will
all
depend
on
what
you
tell
me
the
night
before
i
go
away
you
agree
we
going
to
settle
things
then
do
you
lucy
i
do
yes
you
do
do
you
well
chapter
xiii
tonight
george
began
a
jubilant
warfare
upon
his
aunt
fanny
opening
the
campaign
upon
his
return
home
at
about
eleven
fanny
had
retired
and
was
presumably
asleep
but
george
on
the
way
to
his
own
room
paused
before
her
door
and
serenaded
her
in
a
full
baritone
as
i
walk
along
the
boy
de
balong
with
my
independent
air
the
people
all
declare
must
be
a
millionaire
oh
you
hear
them
sigh
and
wish
to
die
and
see
them
wink
the
other
eye
at
the
man
that
broke
the
bank
at
monte
carlo
isabel
came
from
george
room
where
she
had
been
reading
waiting
for
him
i
afraid
you
disturb
your
father
dear
i
wish
you
sing
more
though
in
the
daytime
you
have
a
splendid
old
lady
i
thought
perhaps
i
did
you
want
me
to
come
in
with
you
and
talk
a
little
not
you
go
to
bed
old
lady
he
kissed
her
hilariously
entered
his
room
with
a
skip
closed
his
door
noisily
and
then
he
could
be
heard
tossing
things
about
loudly
humming
the
man
that
broke
the
bank
at
monte
smiling
his
mother
knelt
outside
his
door
to
pray
then
with
her
amen
pressed
her
lips
to
the
bronze
and
went
silently
to
her
own
apartment
after
breakfasting
in
bed
george
spent
the
next
morning
at
his
grandfather
and
did
not
encounter
his
aunt
fanny
until
lunch
when
she
seemed
to
be
ready
for
him
thank
you
so
much
for
the
serenade
george
she
said
your
poor
father
tells
me
he
just
got
to
sleep
for
the
first
time
in
two
nights
but
after
your
kind
attentions
he
lay
awake
the
rest
of
last
perfectly
true
minafer
said
grimly
of
course
i
did
know
sir
george
hastened
to
assure
him
awfully
sorry
but
aunt
fanny
was
so
gloomy
and
excited
before
i
went
out
last
evening
i
thought
she
needed
cheering
i
fanny
jeered
i
was
gloomy
i
was
excited
you
mean
about
that
engagement
yes
were
you
i
thought
i
heard
you
worrying
over
somebody
being
engaged
did
i
hear
you
say
you
heard
eugene
morgan
was
engaged
to
marry
some
pretty
little
girl
fanny
was
stung
but
she
made
a
brave
effort
did
you
ask
lucy
she
said
her
voice
almost
refusing
the
teasing
laugh
she
tried
to
make
it
utter
did
you
ask
her
when
fred
kinney
and
she
yes
that
story
was
true
but
the
other
one
here
he
stared
at
fanny
and
then
affected
dismay
why
what
the
matter
with
your
face
aunt
fanny
it
seems
agitated
agitated
fanny
said
disdainfully
but
her
voice
undeniably
lacked
steadiness
agitated
oh
come
minafer
interposed
let
have
a
little
peace
i
willing
said
george
i
do
want
to
see
poor
aunt
fanny
all
stirred
up
over
a
rumour
i
just
this
minute
invented
myself
she
so
excitable
about
certain
subjects
it
hard
to
control
he
turned
to
his
mother
what
the
matter
with
grandfather
did
you
see
him
this
morning
isabel
asked
yes
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
all
that
but
he
seemed
pretty
fidgety
has
he
been
having
trouble
with
his
heart
again
not
lately
well
he
not
himself
i
tried
to
talk
to
him
about
the
estate
disgraceful
it
really
is
the
way
things
are
looking
he
listen
and
he
seemed
upset
what
he
upset
over
isabel
looked
serious
however
it
was
her
husband
who
suggested
gloomily
i
suppose
the
major
bothered
about
this
sydney
and
amelia
business
most
what
sydney
and
amelia
business
george
asked
your
mother
can
tell
you
if
she
wants
to
minafer
said
it
not
my
side
of
the
family
so
i
keep
it
rather
disagreeable
for
all
of
us
georgie
isabel
began
you
see
your
uncle
sydney
wanted
a
diplomatic
position
and
he
thought
brother
george
being
in
congress
could
arrange
it
george
did
get
him
the
offer
of
a
south
american
ministry
but
sydney
wanted
a
european
ambassadorship
and
he
got
quite
indignant
with
poor
george
for
thinking
he
take
anything
smaller
and
he
believes
george
did
work
hard
enough
for
him
george
had
done
his
best
of
course
and
now
he
out
of
congress
and
wo
run
again
so
there
sydney
idea
of
a
big
diplomatic
position
gone
for
good
well
sydney
and
your
aunt
amelia
are
terribly
disappointed
and
they
say
they
been
thinking
for
years
that
this
town
is
really
fit
to
live
in
a
gentleman
sydney
says
and
it
is
getting
rather
big
and
dirty
so
they
sold
their
house
and
decided
to
go
abroad
to
live
permanently
there
a
villa
near
florence
they
often
talked
of
buying
and
they
want
father
to
let
them
have
their
share
of
the
estate
now
instead
of
waiting
for
him
to
leave
it
to
them
in
his
well
i
suppose
that
fair
enough
george
said
that
is
in
case
he
intended
to
leave
them
a
certain
amount
in
his
of
course
that
understood
georgie
father
explained
his
will
to
us
long
ago
a
third
to
them
and
a
third
to
brother
george
and
a
third
to
her
son
made
a
simple
calculation
in
his
mind
uncle
george
was
a
bachelor
and
probably
would
never
marry
sydney
and
amelia
were
childless
the
major
only
grandchild
appeared
to
remain
the
eventual
heir
of
the
entire
property
no
matter
if
the
major
did
turn
over
to
sydney
a
third
of
it
now
and
george
had
a
fragmentary
vision
of
himself
in
mourning
arriving
to
take
possession
of
a
historic
florentine
villa
he
saw
himself
walking
up
a
path
with
ancient
carven
stone
balustrades
in
the
distance
and
servants
in
mourning
livery
greeting
the
new
signore
well
i
suppose
grandfather
own
affair
he
can
do
it
or
not
just
as
he
likes
i
see
why
he
mind
he
seemed
rather
confused
and
pained
about
it
isabel
said
i
think
they
ought
to
urge
it
george
says
that
the
estate
wo
stand
taking
out
the
third
that
sydney
wants
and
that
sydney
and
amelia
are
behaving
like
a
couple
of
she
laughed
continuing
of
course
i
do
know
whether
they
are
or
not
i
never
have
understood
any
more
about
business
myself
than
a
little
pig
would
but
i
on
george
side
whether
right
or
wrong
i
always
was
from
the
time
we
were
children
and
sydney
and
amelia
are
hurt
with
me
about
it
i
afraid
they
stopped
speaking
to
george
entirely
poor
father
family
rows
at
his
time
of
george
became
thoughtful
if
sydney
and
amelia
were
behaving
like
pigs
things
might
not
be
so
simple
as
at
first
they
seemed
to
be
uncle
sydney
and
aunt
amelia
might
live
an
awful
long
while
he
thought
and
besides
people
did
always
leave
their
fortunes
to
relatives
sydney
might
die
first
leaving
everything
to
his
widow
and
some
italian
adventurer
might
get
round
her
over
there
in
florence
she
might
be
fool
enough
to
marry
again
or
even
adopt
somebody
he
became
more
and
more
thoughtful
forgetting
entirely
a
plan
he
had
formed
for
the
continued
teasing
of
his
aunt
fanny
and
an
hour
after
lunch
he
strolled
over
to
his
grandfather
intending
to
apply
for
further
information
as
a
party
rightfully
interested
he
did
not
carry
out
this
intention
however
going
into
the
big
house
by
a
side
entrance
he
was
informed
that
the
major
was
upstairs
in
his
bedroom
that
his
sons
sydney
and
george
were
both
with
him
and
that
a
serious
argument
was
in
progress
you
kin
stan
right
in
de
middle
dat
big
said
old
sam
the
ancient
negro
who
was
his
informant
an
you
kin
heah
all
you
to
wivout
goin
on
up
no
fudda
sydney
an
mist
jawge
talkin
i
evuh
heah
nobody
on
in
nish
heah
house
quollin
honey
big
quollin
all
right
said
george
shortly
you
go
on
back
to
your
own
part
of
the
house
and
do
make
any
talk
hear
me
yessuh
yessuh
sam
chuckled
as
he
shuffled
away
plenty
wivout
sam
yessuh
george
went
to
the
foot
of
the
great
stairway
he
could
hear
angry
voices
overhead
those
of
his
two
uncles
and
a
plaintive
murmur
as
if
the
major
tried
to
keep
the
peace
such
sounds
were
far
from
encouraging
to
callers
and
george
decided
not
to
go
upstairs
until
this
interview
was
over
his
decision
was
the
result
of
no
timidity
nor
of
a
too
sensitive
delicacy
what
he
felt
was
that
if
he
interrupted
the
scene
in
his
grandfather
room
just
at
this
time
one
of
the
three
gentlemen
engaging
in
it
might
speak
to
him
in
a
peremptory
manner
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
and
george
saw
no
reason
for
exposing
his
dignity
to
such
mischances
therefore
he
turned
from
the
stairway
and
going
quietly
into
the
library
picked
up
a
magazine
but
he
did
not
open
it
for
his
attention
was
instantly
arrested
by
his
aunt
amelia
voice
speaking
in
the
next
room
the
door
was
open
and
george
heard
her
distinctly
isabel
does
isabel
she
exclaimed
her
tone
high
and
shrewish
you
need
tell
me
anything
about
isabel
minafer
i
guess
my
dear
old
frank
bronson
i
know
her
a
little
better
than
you
do
do
you
think
george
heard
the
voice
of
bronson
replying
a
voice
familiar
to
him
as
that
of
his
grandfather
and
chief
intimate
as
well
he
was
a
contemporary
of
the
major
being
over
seventy
and
they
had
been
through
three
years
of
the
war
in
the
same
regiment
amelia
addressed
him
now
with
an
effect
of
angry
mockery
as
my
dear
old
frank
bronson
but
that
without
the
mockery
was
how
the
amberson
family
almost
always
spoke
of
him
dear
old
frank
he
was
a
hale
thin
old
man
six
feet
three
inches
tall
and
without
a
stoop
i
doubt
your
knowing
isabel
he
said
stiffly
you
speak
of
her
as
you
do
because
she
sides
with
her
brother
george
instead
of
with
you
and
pooh
aunt
amelia
was
evidently
in
a
passion
you
know
what
been
going
on
over
there
well
enough
frank
bronson
i
do
even
know
what
you
talking
oh
you
do
you
do
know
that
isabel
takes
george
side
simply
because
he
eugene
morgan
best
friend
it
seems
to
me
you
talking
pure
nonsense
said
bronson
sharply
not
impure
nonsense
i
hope
amelia
became
shrill
i
thought
you
were
a
man
of
the
world
tell
me
you
blind
for
nearly
two
years
isabel
been
pretending
to
chaperone
fanny
minafer
with
eugene
and
all
the
time
she
been
dragging
that
poor
fool
fanny
around
to
chaperone
her
and
eugene
under
the
circumstances
she
knows
people
will
get
to
thinking
fanny
a
pretty
slim
kind
of
chaperone
and
isabel
wants
to
please
george
because
she
thinks
there
be
less
talk
if
she
can
keep
her
own
brother
around
seeming
to
approve
she
better
look
out
the
whole
town
will
be
talking
the
first
thing
she
knows
she
amelia
stopped
and
stared
at
the
doorway
in
a
panic
for
her
nephew
stood
there
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
his
white
face
for
a
few
strained
moments
then
regaining
her
nerve
looked
away
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
were
intended
to
hear
what
i
been
saying
george
she
said
quietly
but
since
you
seem
to
yes
i
so
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
again
after
all
i
do
know
but
it
just
as
well
in
the
long
he
walked
up
to
where
she
sat
you
you
he
said
thickly
it
seems
it
seems
to
me
you
you
pretty
common
amelia
tried
to
give
the
impression
of
an
unconcerned
person
laughing
with
complete
indifference
but
the
sounds
she
produced
were
disjointed
and
uneasy
she
fanned
herself
looking
out
of
the
open
window
near
her
of
course
if
you
want
to
make
more
trouble
in
the
family
than
already
got
george
with
your
eavesdropping
you
can
go
and
repeat
old
bronson
had
risen
from
his
chair
in
great
distress
your
aunt
was
talking
nonsense
because
she
piqued
over
a
business
matter
george
he
said
she
does
mean
what
she
said
and
neither
she
nor
any
one
else
gives
the
slightest
credit
to
such
foolishness
no
one
in
the
world
george
gulped
and
wet
lines
shone
suddenly
along
his
lower
eyelids
they
they
better
not
he
said
then
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
he
stamped
fiercely
across
the
stone
slabs
of
the
front
porch
descended
the
steps
and
halted
abruptly
blinking
in
the
strong
sunshine
in
front
of
his
own
gate
beyond
the
major
broad
lawn
his
mother
was
just
getting
into
her
victoria
where
sat
already
his
aunt
fanny
and
lucy
morgan
it
was
a
summer
the
three
ladies
charmingly
dressed
delicate
parasols
aloft
the
lines
of
the
victoria
graceful
as
those
of
a
violin
the
trim
pair
of
bays
in
glistening
harness
picked
out
with
silver
and
the
serious
black
driver
whom
isabel
being
an
amberson
dared
even
in
that
town
to
put
into
a
black
livery
coat
boots
white
breeches
and
cockaded
hat
they
jingled
smartly
away
and
seeing
george
standing
on
the
major
lawn
lucy
waved
and
isabel
threw
him
a
kiss
but
george
shuddered
pretending
not
to
see
them
and
stooped
as
if
searching
for
something
lost
in
the
grass
protracting
that
posture
until
the
victoria
was
out
of
hearing
and
ten
minutes
later
george
amberson
somewhat
in
the
semblance
of
an
angry
person
plunging
out
of
the
mansion
found
a
pale
nephew
waiting
to
accost
him
i
have
time
to
talk
yes
you
have
you
better
what
the
matter
then
his
namesake
drew
him
away
from
the
vicinity
of
the
house
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
just
heard
aunt
amelia
say
in
i
do
want
to
hear
it
said
amberson
i
been
hearing
entirely
too
much
of
what
amelia
says
she
says
my
mother
on
your
side
about
this
division
of
the
property
because
you
eugene
morgan
best
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
has
that
got
to
do
with
your
mother
being
on
my
side
she
said
george
paused
to
swallow
she
said
he
faltered
you
look
sick
said
his
uncle
and
laughed
shortly
if
it
because
of
anything
amelia
been
saying
i
do
blame
you
what
else
did
she
say
george
swallowed
again
as
with
nausea
but
under
his
encouragement
he
was
able
to
be
explicit
she
said
my
mother
wanted
you
to
be
friendly
to
her
about
eugene
morgan
she
said
my
mother
had
been
using
aunt
fanny
as
a
amberson
emitted
a
laugh
of
disgust
it
wonderful
what
a
woman
in
a
state
of
spite
can
think
of
i
suppose
you
do
doubt
that
amelia
amberson
created
this
specimen
of
herself
i
know
she
then
what
the
matter
she
said
george
faltered
again
she
said
she
implied
people
were
were
talking
about
of
all
the
damn
nonsense
his
uncle
exclaimed
george
looked
at
him
haggardly
you
sure
they
not
rubbish
your
mother
on
my
side
about
this
division
because
she
knows
sydney
a
pig
and
always
has
been
a
pig
and
so
has
his
spiteful
wife
i
trying
to
keep
them
from
getting
the
better
of
your
mother
as
well
as
from
getting
the
better
of
me
do
you
suppose
well
they
in
a
rage
because
sydney
always
could
do
what
he
liked
with
father
unless
your
mother
interfered
and
they
know
i
got
isabel
to
ask
him
not
to
do
what
they
wanted
they
keeping
up
the
fight
and
they
sore
and
amelia
a
woman
who
always
says
any
damn
thing
that
comes
into
her
head
that
all
there
is
to
but
she
said
george
persisted
wretchedly
she
said
there
was
talk
she
said
look
here
young
fellow
amberson
laughed
there
probably
is
some
harmless
talk
about
the
way
your
aunt
fanny
goes
after
poor
eugene
and
i
no
doubt
i
abetted
it
myself
people
ca
help
being
amused
by
a
thing
like
that
fanny
was
always
languishing
at
him
years
ago
before
he
left
here
well
we
ca
blame
the
poor
thing
if
she
got
her
hopes
up
again
and
i
do
know
that
i
blame
her
myself
for
using
your
mother
the
way
she
how
do
you
mean
amberson
put
his
hand
on
george
shoulder
you
like
to
tease
fanny
he
said
but
i
would
tease
her
about
this
if
i
were
you
fanny
has
got
much
in
her
life
you
know
georgie
just
being
an
aunt
really
the
great
career
it
may
sometimes
appear
to
you
in
fact
i
do
know
of
anything
much
that
fanny
has
got
except
her
feeling
about
eugene
she
always
had
it
and
what
funny
to
us
is
pretty
much
to
her
i
suspect
now
i
not
deny
that
eugene
morgan
is
attracted
to
your
mother
he
is
and
that
another
case
of
was
but
i
know
him
and
he
a
knight
george
a
crazy
one
perhaps
if
you
read
quixote
and
i
think
your
mother
likes
him
better
than
she
likes
any
man
outside
her
own
family
and
that
he
interests
her
more
than
anybody
else
and
has
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
except
except
what
george
asked
quickly
as
he
paused
except
that
i
suspect
amberson
chuckled
and
began
over
i
tell
you
in
confidence
i
think
fanny
a
fairly
tricky
customer
for
such
an
innocent
old
girl
there
is
any
real
harm
in
her
but
she
a
great
diplomatist
lots
of
cards
up
her
lace
sleeves
georgie
by
the
way
did
you
ever
notice
how
proud
she
is
of
her
arms
always
flashing
at
poor
eugene
and
he
stopped
to
laugh
again
i
do
see
anything
confidential
about
that
george
complained
i
thought
wait
a
minute
my
idea
is
do
forget
it
a
confidential
one
but
i
devilish
right
about
it
young
georgie
it
this
fanny
uses
your
mother
for
a
decoy
duck
she
does
everything
in
the
world
she
can
to
keep
your
mother
friendship
with
eugene
going
because
she
thinks
that
what
keeps
eugene
about
the
place
so
to
speak
fanny
always
with
your
mother
you
see
and
whenever
he
sees
isabel
he
sees
fanny
fanny
thinks
he
get
used
to
the
idea
of
her
being
around
and
some
day
her
chance
may
come
you
see
she
probably
afraid
perhaps
she
even
knows
poor
thing
that
she
would
get
to
see
much
of
eugene
if
it
were
for
isabel
being
such
a
friend
of
his
there
see
well
i
suppose
george
brow
was
still
dark
however
if
sure
whatever
talk
there
is
is
about
aunt
fanny
if
that
so
do
be
an
ass
his
uncle
advised
him
lightly
moving
away
i
off
for
a
week
fishing
to
forget
that
woman
in
there
and
her
pig
of
a
his
gesture
toward
the
mansion
indicated
and
sydney
amberson
i
recommend
a
like
course
to
you
if
you
silly
enough
to
pay
any
attention
to
such
rubbishings
george
was
partially
reassured
but
still
troubled
a
word
haunted
him
like
the
recollection
of
a
nightmare
talk
he
stood
looking
at
the
houses
across
the
street
from
the
mansion
and
though
the
sunshine
was
bright
upon
them
they
seemed
mysteriously
threatening
he
had
always
despised
them
except
the
largest
of
them
which
was
the
home
of
his
henchman
charlie
johnson
the
johnsons
had
originally
owned
a
lot
three
hundred
feet
wide
but
they
had
sold
all
of
it
except
the
meager
frontage
before
the
house
itself
and
five
houses
were
now
crowded
into
the
space
where
one
used
to
squire
it
so
spaciously
up
and
down
the
street
the
same
transformation
had
taken
place
every
big
comfortable
old
brick
house
now
had
two
or
three
smaller
frame
neighbours
crowding
up
to
it
on
each
side
neighbours
most
of
them
needing
paint
and
not
clean
and
yet
though
they
were
cheap
looking
they
had
cost
as
much
to
build
as
the
big
brick
houses
whose
former
ample
yards
they
occupied
only
where
george
stood
was
there
left
a
sward
as
of
yore
the
great
level
green
lawn
that
served
for
both
the
major
house
and
his
daughter
this
serene
domain
unbroken
except
for
the
two
gravelled
alone
remained
as
it
had
been
during
the
early
glories
of
the
amberson
addition
george
stared
at
the
ugly
houses
opposite
and
hated
them
more
than
ever
but
he
shivered
perhaps
the
riffraff
living
in
those
houses
sat
at
the
windows
to
watch
their
betters
perhaps
they
dared
to
gossip
he
uttered
an
exclamation
and
walked
rapidly
toward
his
own
front
gate
the
victoria
had
returned
with
miss
fanny
alone
she
jumped
out
briskly
and
the
victoria
waited
where
mother
george
asked
sharply
as
he
met
her
at
lucy
i
only
came
back
to
get
some
embroidery
because
we
found
the
sun
too
hot
for
driving
i
in
a
but
going
into
the
house
with
her
he
detained
her
when
she
would
have
hastened
upstairs
i
have
time
to
talk
now
georgie
i
going
right
back
i
promised
your
mother
you
listen
said
george
what
on
earth
he
repeated
what
amelia
had
said
this
time
however
he
spoke
coldly
and
without
the
emotion
he
had
exhibited
during
the
recital
to
his
uncle
fanny
was
the
one
who
showed
agitation
during
this
interview
for
she
grew
fiery
red
and
her
eyes
dilated
what
on
earth
do
you
want
to
bring
such
trash
to
me
for
she
demanded
breathing
fast
i
merely
wished
to
know
two
things
whether
it
is
your
duty
or
mine
to
speak
to
father
of
what
aunt
amelia
fanny
stamped
her
foot
you
little
fool
she
cried
you
awful
little
fool
i
decline
decline
my
hat
your
father
a
sick
man
and
you
he
does
seem
so
to
well
he
does
to
me
and
you
want
to
go
troubling
him
with
an
amberson
family
row
it
just
what
that
cat
would
love
you
to
do
well
i
tell
your
father
if
you
like
it
will
only
make
him
a
little
sicker
to
think
he
got
a
son
silly
enough
to
listen
to
such
craziness
then
you
sure
there
is
any
talk
fanny
disdained
a
reply
in
words
she
made
a
hissing
sound
of
utter
contempt
and
snapped
her
fingers
then
she
asked
scornfully
what
the
other
thing
you
wanted
to
know
george
pallor
increased
whether
it
might
be
better
under
the
circumstances
he
said
if
this
family
were
not
so
intimate
with
the
morgan
family
at
least
for
a
time
it
might
be
better
fanny
stared
at
him
incredulously
you
mean
you
quit
seeing
lucy
i
had
thought
of
that
side
of
it
but
if
such
a
thing
were
necessary
on
account
of
talk
about
my
mother
i
i
he
hesitated
unhappily
i
suggested
that
if
all
of
us
for
a
time
perhaps
only
for
a
time
it
might
be
better
if
see
here
she
interrupted
we
settle
this
nonsense
right
now
if
eugene
morgan
comes
to
this
house
for
instance
to
see
me
your
mother
ca
get
up
and
leave
the
place
the
minute
he
gets
here
can
she
what
do
you
want
her
to
do
insult
him
or
perhaps
you
prefer
she
insult
lucy
that
would
do
just
as
well
what
is
it
you
up
to
anyhow
do
you
really
love
your
aunt
amelia
so
much
that
you
want
to
please
her
or
do
you
really
hate
your
aunt
fanny
so
much
that
you
want
to
that
you
want
to
she
choked
and
sought
for
her
handkerchief
suddenly
she
began
to
cry
oh
see
here
george
said
i
do
hate
you
aunt
fanny
silly
i
do
you
do
you
do
you
want
to
you
want
to
destroy
the
only
thing
that
i
that
i
ever
and
unable
to
continue
she
became
inaudible
in
her
handkerchief
george
felt
remorseful
and
his
own
troubles
were
lightened
all
at
once
it
became
clear
to
him
that
he
had
been
worrying
about
nothing
he
perceived
that
his
aunt
amelia
was
indeed
an
old
cat
and
that
to
give
her
scandalous
meanderings
another
thought
would
be
the
height
of
folly
by
no
means
unsusceptible
to
such
pathos
as
that
now
exposed
before
him
he
did
not
lack
pity
for
fanny
whose
almost
spoken
confession
was
lamentable
and
he
was
granted
the
vision
to
understand
that
his
mother
also
pitied
fanny
infinitely
more
than
he
did
this
seemed
to
explain
everything
he
patted
the
unhappy
lady
awkwardly
upon
her
shoulder
there
there
he
said
i
did
mean
anything
of
course
the
only
thing
to
do
about
aunt
amelia
is
to
pay
no
attention
to
her
it
all
right
aunt
fanny
do
cry
i
feel
a
lot
better
now
myself
come
on
i
drive
back
there
with
you
it
all
over
and
nothing
the
matter
ca
you
cheer
up
fanny
cheered
up
and
presently
the
customarily
hostile
aunt
and
nephew
were
driving
out
amberson
boulevard
amiably
together
in
the
hot
sunshine
chapter
xiv
almost
was
lucy
last
word
on
the
last
night
of
vacation
that
vital
evening
which
she
had
half
consented
to
agree
upon
for
settling
things
between
them
almost
engaged
she
meant
and
george
discontented
with
the
almost
but
contented
that
she
seemed
glad
to
wear
a
sapphire
locket
with
a
tiny
photograph
of
george
amberson
minafer
inside
it
found
himself
wonderful
in
a
new
world
at
the
final
instant
of
their
parting
for
after
declining
to
let
him
kiss
her
as
if
his
desire
for
such
a
ceremony
were
the
most
preposterous
absurdity
in
the
world
she
had
leaned
suddenly
close
to
him
and
left
upon
his
cheek
the
veriest
feather
from
a
fairy
wing
she
wrote
him
a
month
later
no
it
must
keep
on
being
almost
is
almost
pretty
pleasant
you
know
well
enough
that
i
care
for
you
i
did
from
the
first
minute
i
saw
you
and
i
pretty
sure
you
knew
it
i
afraid
you
did
i
afraid
you
always
knew
it
i
not
conventional
and
cautious
about
being
engaged
as
you
say
i
am
dear
i
always
read
over
the
dears
in
your
letters
a
time
or
two
as
you
say
you
do
in
mine
only
i
read
all
of
your
letters
a
time
or
two
but
it
such
a
solemn
thing
it
scares
me
it
means
a
good
deal
to
a
lot
of
people
besides
you
and
me
and
that
scares
me
too
you
write
that
i
take
your
feeling
for
me
too
lightly
and
that
i
take
the
whole
affair
too
is
that
odd
because
to
myself
i
seem
to
take
it
as
something
so
much
more
solemn
than
you
do
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
to
find
myself
an
old
lady
some
day
still
thinking
of
you
while
you
be
away
and
away
with
somebody
else
perhaps
and
me
forgotten
ages
ago
lucy
morgan
you
say
when
you
saw
my
obituary
lucy
morgan
let
me
see
i
seem
to
remember
the
name
did
i
know
some
lucy
morgan
or
other
once
upon
a
time
then
you
shake
your
big
white
head
and
stroke
your
long
white
beard
you
have
such
a
distinguished
long
white
beard
and
you
say
i
do
seem
to
remember
any
lucy
morgan
i
wonder
what
made
me
think
i
did
and
poor
me
i
be
deep
in
the
ground
wondering
if
you
heard
about
it
and
what
you
were
saying
for
do
work
too
hard
dear
george
immediately
seized
pen
and
paper
plaintively
but
vigorously
requesting
lucy
not
to
imagine
him
with
a
beard
distinguished
or
otherwise
even
in
the
extremities
of
age
then
after
inscribing
his
protest
in
the
matter
of
this
visioned
beard
he
concluded
his
missive
in
a
tone
mollified
to
tenderness
and
proceeded
to
read
a
letter
from
his
mother
which
had
reached
him
simultaneously
with
lucy
isabel
wrote
from
asheville
where
she
had
just
arrived
with
her
husband
i
think
your
father
looks
better
already
darling
though
we
been
here
only
a
few
hours
it
may
be
we
found
just
the
place
to
build
him
up
the
doctors
said
they
hoped
it
would
prove
to
be
and
if
it
is
it
would
be
worth
the
long
struggle
we
had
with
him
to
get
him
to
give
up
and
come
poor
dear
man
he
was
so
blue
not
about
his
health
but
about
giving
up
the
worries
down
at
his
office
and
forgetting
them
for
a
time
if
he
only
will
forget
them
it
took
the
pressure
of
the
family
and
all
his
best
friends
to
get
him
to
come
but
father
and
brother
george
and
fanny
and
eugene
morgan
all
kept
at
him
so
constantly
that
he
just
had
to
give
in
i
afraid
that
in
my
anxiety
to
get
him
to
do
what
the
doctors
wanted
him
to
i
was
able
to
back
up
brother
george
as
i
should
in
his
difficulty
with
sydney
and
amelia
i
so
sorry
george
is
more
upset
than
i
ever
seen
him
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
they
sailing
before
long
i
hear
to
live
in
florence
father
said
he
could
stand
the
constant
persuading
i
afraid
the
word
he
used
was
i
ca
understand
people
behaving
like
that
george
says
they
may
be
ambersons
but
they
vulgar
i
afraid
i
almost
agree
with
him
at
least
i
think
they
were
inconsiderate
but
i
do
see
why
i
unburdening
myself
of
all
this
to
you
poor
darling
we
have
forgotten
all
about
it
long
before
you
come
home
for
the
holidays
and
it
should
mean
little
or
nothing
to
you
anyway
forget
that
i
been
so
foolish
your
father
is
waiting
for
me
to
take
a
walk
with
him
that
a
splendid
sign
because
he
has
felt
he
could
walk
much
at
home
lately
i
must
keep
him
waiting
be
careful
to
wear
your
mackintosh
and
rubbers
in
rainy
weather
and
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
get
colder
your
ulster
wish
you
could
see
your
father
now
looks
so
much
better
we
plan
to
stay
six
weeks
if
the
place
agrees
with
him
it
does
really
seem
to
already
he
just
called
in
the
door
to
say
he
waiting
do
smoke
too
much
darling
boy
devotedly
your
mother
isabel
but
she
did
not
keep
her
husband
there
for
the
six
weeks
she
anticipated
she
did
not
keep
him
anywhere
that
long
three
weeks
after
writing
this
letter
she
telegraphed
suddenly
to
george
that
they
were
leaving
for
home
at
once
and
four
days
later
when
he
and
a
friend
came
whistling
into
his
study
from
lunch
at
the
club
he
found
another
telegram
upon
his
desk
he
read
it
twice
before
he
comprehended
its
import
papa
left
us
at
ten
this
morning
dearest
mother
the
friend
saw
the
change
in
his
face
not
bad
news
george
lifted
utterly
dumfounded
eyes
from
the
yellow
paper
my
father
he
said
weakly
she
says
she
says
he
dead
i
got
to
go
his
uncle
george
and
the
major
met
him
at
the
station
when
he
arrived
the
first
time
the
major
had
ever
come
to
meet
his
grandson
the
old
gentleman
sat
in
his
closed
carriage
which
still
needed
paint
at
the
entrance
to
the
station
but
he
got
out
and
advanced
to
grasp
george
hand
tremulously
when
the
latter
appeared
poor
fellow
he
said
and
patted
him
repeatedly
upon
the
shoulder
poor
fellow
poor
georgie
george
had
not
yet
come
to
a
full
realization
of
his
loss
so
far
his
condition
was
merely
dazed
and
as
the
major
continued
to
pat
him
murmuring
poor
fellow
over
and
over
george
was
seized
by
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
tell
his
grandfather
that
he
was
not
a
poodle
but
he
said
thanks
in
a
low
voice
and
got
into
the
carriage
his
two
relatives
following
with
deferential
sympathy
he
noticed
that
the
major
tremulousness
did
not
disappear
as
they
drove
up
the
street
and
that
he
seemed
much
feebler
than
during
the
summer
principally
however
george
was
concerned
with
his
own
emotion
or
rather
with
his
lack
of
emotion
and
the
anxious
sympathy
of
his
grandfather
and
his
uncle
made
him
feel
hypocritical
he
was
not
but
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
and
with
a
secret
shame
concealed
his
callousness
beneath
an
affectation
of
solemnity
but
when
he
was
taken
into
the
room
where
lay
what
was
left
of
wilbur
minafer
george
had
no
longer
to
pretend
his
grief
was
sufficient
it
needed
only
the
sight
of
that
forever
inert
semblance
of
the
quiet
man
who
had
been
always
so
quiet
a
part
of
his
son
life
so
quiet
a
part
that
george
had
seldom
been
consciously
aware
that
his
father
was
indeed
a
part
of
his
life
as
the
figure
lay
there
its
very
quietness
was
what
was
most
lifelike
and
suddenly
it
struck
george
hard
and
in
that
unexpected
racking
grief
of
his
son
wilbur
minafer
became
more
vividly
george
father
than
he
had
ever
been
in
life
when
george
left
the
room
his
arm
was
about
his
mother
his
shoulders
were
still
shaken
with
sobs
he
leaned
upon
his
mother
she
gently
comforted
him
and
presently
he
recovered
his
composure
and
became
enough
to
wonder
if
he
had
not
been
making
an
unmanly
display
of
himself
i
all
right
again
mother
he
said
awkwardly
do
worry
about
me
you
better
go
lie
down
or
something
you
look
pretty
isabel
did
look
pretty
pale
but
not
ghastly
pale
as
fanny
did
grief
was
overwhelming
she
stayed
in
her
room
and
george
did
not
see
her
until
the
next
day
a
few
minutes
before
the
funeral
when
her
haggard
face
appalled
him
but
by
this
time
he
was
quite
himself
again
and
during
the
short
service
in
the
cemetery
his
thoughts
even
wandered
so
far
as
to
permit
him
a
feeling
of
regret
not
directly
connected
with
his
father
beyond
the
open
grave
was
a
mound
where
new
grass
grew
and
here
lay
his
old
john
minafer
who
had
died
the
previous
autumn
and
beyond
this
were
the
graves
of
grandfather
and
grandmother
minafer
and
of
his
grandfather
second
wife
and
her
three
sons
george
who
had
been
drowned
together
in
a
canoe
accident
when
george
was
a
child
fanny
was
the
last
of
the
family
next
beyond
was
the
amberson
family
lot
where
lay
the
major
wife
and
their
sons
henry
and
milton
uncles
whom
george
dimly
remembered
and
beside
them
lay
isabel
older
sister
his
aunt
estelle
who
had
died
in
her
girlhood
long
before
george
was
born
the
minafer
monument
was
a
granite
block
with
the
name
chiseled
upon
its
one
polished
side
and
the
amberson
monument
was
a
white
marble
shaft
taller
than
any
other
in
that
neighbourhood
but
farther
on
there
was
a
newer
section
of
the
cemetery
an
addition
which
had
been
thrown
open
to
occupancy
only
a
few
years
before
after
dexterous
modern
treatment
by
a
landscape
specialist
there
were
some
large
new
mausoleums
here
and
shafts
taller
than
the
ambersons
as
well
as
a
number
of
monuments
of
some
sculptural
pretentiousness
and
altogether
the
new
section
appeared
to
be
a
more
fashionable
and
important
quarter
than
that
older
one
which
contained
the
amberson
and
minafer
lots
this
was
what
caused
regret
during
the
moment
or
two
when
his
mind
strayed
from
his
father
and
the
reading
of
the
service
on
the
train
going
back
to
college
ten
days
later
this
regret
though
it
was
as
much
an
annoyance
as
a
regret
recurred
to
his
mind
and
a
feeling
developed
within
him
that
the
new
quarter
of
the
cemetery
was
in
bad
taste
not
architecturally
or
sculpturally
perhaps
but
in
presumption
it
seemed
to
flaunt
a
kind
of
parvenu
ignorance
as
if
it
were
actually
pleased
to
be
unaware
that
all
the
aristocratic
and
really
important
families
were
buried
in
the
old
section
the
annoyance
gave
way
before
a
recollection
of
the
sweet
mournfulness
of
his
mother
face
as
she
had
said
to
him
at
the
station
and
of
how
lovely
she
looked
in
her
mourning
he
thought
of
lucy
whom
he
had
seen
only
twice
and
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
in
these
quiet
interviews
he
had
appeared
to
her
as
tinged
with
heroism
she
had
shown
rather
than
said
how
brave
she
thought
him
in
his
sorrow
but
what
came
most
vividly
to
george
mind
during
these
retrospections
was
the
despairing
face
of
his
aunt
fanny
again
and
again
he
thought
of
it
he
could
not
avoid
its
haunting
and
for
days
after
he
got
back
to
college
the
stricken
likeness
of
fanny
would
appear
before
him
unexpectedly
and
without
a
cause
that
he
could
trace
in
his
immediately
previous
thoughts
her
grief
had
been
so
silent
yet
it
had
so
amazed
him
george
felt
more
and
more
compassion
for
this
ancient
antagonist
of
his
and
he
wrote
to
his
mother
about
her
i
afraid
poor
aunt
fanny
might
think
now
father
gone
we
wo
want
her
to
live
with
us
any
longer
and
because
i
always
teased
her
so
much
she
might
think
i
be
for
turning
her
out
i
do
know
where
on
earth
she
go
or
what
she
could
live
on
if
we
did
do
something
like
this
and
of
course
we
never
would
do
such
a
thing
but
i
pretty
sure
she
had
something
of
the
kind
on
her
mind
she
did
say
anything
but
the
way
she
looked
is
what
makes
me
think
so
honestly
to
me
she
looked
just
scared
sick
you
tell
her
there
is
any
danger
in
the
world
of
my
treating
her
like
that
tell
her
everything
is
to
go
on
just
as
it
always
has
tell
her
to
cheer
up
chapter
xv
isabel
did
more
for
fanny
than
telling
her
to
cheer
up
everything
that
fanny
inherited
from
her
father
old
aleck
minafer
had
been
invested
in
wilbur
business
and
wilbur
business
after
a
period
of
illness
corresponding
in
dates
to
the
illness
of
wilbur
body
had
died
just
before
wilbur
did
george
amberson
and
fanny
were
both
wiped
out
to
a
miracle
of
precision
as
amberson
said
they
owned
not
a
penny
and
owed
not
a
penny
he
continued
explaining
his
phrase
it
like
the
moment
just
before
drowning
you
not
under
water
and
you
not
out
of
it
all
you
know
is
that
you
not
dead
he
spoke
philosophically
having
his
prospects
from
his
father
to
fall
back
upon
but
fanny
had
neither
prospects
nor
philosophy
however
a
legal
survey
of
wilbur
estate
revealed
the
fact
that
his
life
insurance
was
left
clear
of
the
wreck
and
isabel
with
the
cheerful
consent
of
her
son
promptly
turned
this
salvage
over
to
her
invested
it
would
yield
something
better
than
nine
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
thus
she
was
assured
of
becoming
neither
a
pauper
nor
a
dependent
but
proved
to
be
as
amberson
said
adding
his
efforts
to
the
cheering
up
of
fanny
an
heiress
after
all
in
spite
of
rolling
mills
and
the
she
was
unable
to
smile
and
he
continued
his
humane
gayeties
see
what
a
wonderfully
desirable
income
nine
hundred
dollars
is
fanny
a
bachelor
to
be
in
your
class
must
have
exactly
thousand
one
hundred
a
year
then
you
see
all
you
need
to
do
in
order
to
have
fifty
thousand
a
year
is
to
be
a
little
encouraging
when
some
bachelor
in
your
class
begins
to
show
by
his
haberdashery
what
he
wants
you
to
think
about
him
she
looked
at
him
wanly
murmured
a
desolate
response
she
had
sewing
to
do
and
left
the
room
while
amberson
shook
his
head
ruefully
at
his
sister
i
often
thought
that
humor
was
not
my
forte
he
sighed
lord
she
does
up
much
the
collegian
did
not
return
to
his
home
for
the
holidays
instead
isabel
joined
him
and
they
went
south
for
the
two
weeks
she
was
proud
of
her
stalwart
son
at
the
hotel
where
they
stayed
and
it
was
meat
and
drink
to
her
when
she
saw
how
people
stared
at
him
in
the
lobby
and
on
the
big
verandas
indeed
her
vanity
in
him
was
so
dominant
that
she
was
unaware
of
their
staring
at
her
with
more
interest
and
an
admiration
friendlier
than
george
evoked
happy
to
have
him
to
herself
for
this
fortnight
she
loved
to
walk
with
him
leaning
upon
his
arm
to
read
with
him
to
watch
the
sea
with
him
perhaps
most
of
all
she
liked
to
enter
the
big
dining
room
with
him
yet
both
of
them
felt
constantly
the
difference
between
this
christmastime
and
other
of
theirs
in
all
it
was
a
sorrowful
holiday
but
when
isabel
came
east
for
george
commencement
in
june
she
brought
lucy
with
her
and
things
began
to
seem
different
especially
when
george
amberson
arrived
with
lucy
father
on
class
day
eugene
had
been
in
new
york
on
business
amberson
easily
persuaded
him
to
this
outing
and
they
made
a
cheerful
party
of
it
with
the
new
graduate
of
course
the
hero
and
center
of
it
all
his
uncle
was
a
fellow
alumnus
yonder
was
where
i
roomed
when
i
was
here
he
said
pointing
out
one
of
the
university
buildings
to
eugene
i
do
know
whether
george
would
let
my
admirers
place
a
tablet
to
mark
the
spot
or
not
he
owns
all
these
buildings
now
you
did
you
when
you
were
here
like
uncle
like
do
tell
george
you
think
he
like
me
just
at
this
time
we
should
be
careful
of
the
young
gentleman
yes
said
eugene
if
we
were
he
might
let
us
exist
at
i
sure
i
did
have
it
so
badly
at
his
age
amberson
said
reflectively
as
they
strolled
on
through
the
commencement
crowd
for
one
thing
i
had
brothers
and
sisters
and
my
mother
did
just
sit
at
my
feet
as
george
does
and
i
was
an
only
grandchild
either
father
always
spoiled
georgie
a
lot
more
than
he
did
any
of
his
eugene
laughed
you
need
only
three
things
to
explain
all
that
good
and
bad
about
three
he
isabel
only
child
he
an
amberson
he
a
well
mister
bones
of
these
three
things
which
are
the
good
ones
and
which
are
the
bad
ones
all
of
them
said
eugene
it
happened
that
just
then
they
came
in
sight
of
the
subject
of
their
discourse
george
was
walking
under
the
elms
with
lucy
swinging
a
stick
and
pointing
out
to
her
various
objects
and
localities
which
had
attained
historical
value
during
the
last
four
years
the
two
older
men
marked
his
gestures
careless
and
graceful
they
observed
his
attitude
unconsciously
noble
his
easy
proprietorship
of
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
and
round
about
of
the
branches
overhead
of
the
old
buildings
beyond
and
of
lucy
i
do
know
eugene
said
smiling
whimsically
i
do
know
when
i
spoke
of
his
being
a
human
being
i
do
know
perhaps
it
more
like
i
wonder
if
i
was
like
that
groaned
you
do
suppose
every
amberson
has
had
to
go
through
it
do
you
do
worry
at
least
half
of
it
is
a
combination
of
youth
good
looks
and
college
and
even
the
noblest
ambersons
get
over
their
nobility
and
come
to
be
people
in
time
it
takes
more
than
time
i
should
say
it
did
take
more
than
time
his
friend
agreed
shaking
a
rueful
head
then
they
walked
over
to
join
the
loveliest
amberson
whom
neither
time
nor
trouble
seemed
to
have
touched
she
stood
alone
thoughtful
under
the
great
trees
chaperoning
george
and
lucy
at
a
distance
but
seeing
the
two
friends
approaching
she
came
to
meet
them
it
charming
is
it
she
said
moving
her
hand
to
indicate
the
summery
dressed
crowd
strolling
about
them
or
clustering
in
groups
each
with
its
own
hero
they
seem
so
eager
and
so
confident
all
these
boys
it
touching
but
of
course
youth
does
know
amberson
coughed
no
it
does
seem
to
take
itself
as
pathetic
precisely
eugene
and
i
were
just
speaking
of
something
like
that
do
you
know
what
i
think
whenever
i
see
these
smooth
triumphal
young
faces
i
always
think
how
you
going
to
catch
it
george
oh
yes
he
said
life
most
ingenious
it
got
a
special
walloping
for
every
mother
son
of
maybe
said
isabel
troubled
maybe
some
of
the
mothers
can
take
the
walloping
for
not
one
her
brother
assured
her
with
emphasis
not
any
more
than
she
can
take
on
her
own
face
the
lines
that
are
bound
to
come
on
her
son
i
suppose
you
know
that
all
these
young
faces
have
got
to
get
lines
on
maybe
they
wo
she
said
smiling
wistfully
maybe
times
will
change
and
nobody
will
have
to
wear
times
have
changed
like
that
for
only
one
person
that
i
know
eugene
said
and
as
isabel
looked
inquiring
he
laughed
and
she
saw
that
she
was
the
only
one
his
implication
was
justified
moreover
and
she
knew
it
she
blushed
charmingly
which
is
it
puts
the
lines
on
the
faces
amberson
asked
is
it
age
or
trouble
of
course
we
ca
decide
that
wisdom
does
it
we
must
be
polite
to
i
tell
you
what
puts
the
lines
there
eugene
said
age
puts
some
and
trouble
puts
some
and
work
puts
some
but
the
deepest
are
carved
by
lack
of
faith
the
serenest
brow
is
the
one
that
believes
the
in
what
isabel
asked
gently
in
everything
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
he
laughed
as
he
had
a
moment
before
when
she
looked
at
him
that
way
oh
yes
you
do
he
said
she
continued
to
look
at
him
inquiringly
a
moment
or
two
longer
and
there
was
an
unconscious
earnestness
in
her
glance
something
trustful
as
well
as
inquiring
as
if
she
knew
that
whatever
he
meant
it
was
all
right
then
her
eyes
drooped
thoughtfully
and
she
seemed
to
address
some
inquiries
to
herself
she
looked
up
suddenly
why
i
believe
she
said
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
believe
i
do
and
at
that
both
men
laughed
isabel
her
brother
exclaimed
a
foolish
person
there
are
times
when
you
look
exactly
fourteen
years
old
but
this
reminded
her
of
her
real
affair
in
that
part
of
the
world
good
gracious
she
said
where
have
the
children
got
to
we
must
take
lucy
pretty
soon
so
that
george
can
go
and
sit
with
the
class
we
must
catch
up
with
she
took
her
brother
arm
and
the
three
moved
on
looking
about
them
in
the
crowd
curious
amberson
remarked
as
they
did
not
immediately
discover
the
young
people
they
sought
even
in
such
a
concourse
one
would
think
we
could
fail
to
see
the
several
hundred
proprietors
today
eugene
suggested
no
they
only
proprietors
of
the
university
said
george
uncle
we
looking
for
the
proprietor
of
the
there
he
is
cried
isabel
fondly
not
minding
this
satire
at
all
and
does
he
look
it
her
escorts
were
still
laughing
at
her
when
they
joined
the
proprietor
of
the
universe
and
his
pretty
friend
and
though
both
amberson
and
eugene
declined
to
explain
the
cause
of
their
mirth
even
upon
urgent
request
the
portents
of
the
day
were
amiable
and
the
five
made
a
happy
party
that
is
to
say
four
of
them
made
a
happy
audience
for
the
fifth
and
the
mood
of
this
fifth
was
gracious
and
cheerful
george
took
no
conspicuous
part
in
either
the
academic
or
the
social
celebrations
of
his
class
he
seemed
to
regard
both
sets
of
exercises
with
a
tolerant
amusement
his
own
crowd
not
going
in
much
for
either
of
those
sorts
of
things
as
he
explained
to
lucy
what
his
crowd
had
gone
in
for
remained
ambiguous
some
negligent
testimony
indicating
that
except
for
an
astonishing
reliability
which
they
all
seemed
to
have
attained
in
matters
relating
to
musical
comedy
they
had
not
gone
in
for
anything
certainly
the
question
one
of
them
put
to
lucy
in
response
to
investigations
of
hers
seemed
to
point
that
way
do
you
think
he
said
really
do
you
think
that
being
things
is
rather
better
than
doing
things
he
said
rahthuh
bettuh
for
rather
better
and
seemed
to
do
it
deliberately
with
perfect
knowledge
of
what
he
was
doing
later
lucy
mocked
him
to
george
and
george
refused
to
smile
he
somewhat
inclined
to
such
pronunciations
himself
this
inclination
was
one
of
the
things
that
he
had
acquired
in
the
four
years
what
else
he
had
acquired
it
might
have
puzzled
him
to
state
had
anybody
asked
him
and
required
a
direct
reply
within
a
reasonable
space
of
time
he
had
learned
how
to
pass
examinations
by
cramming
that
is
in
three
or
four
days
and
nights
he
could
get
into
his
head
enough
of
a
selected
fragment
of
some
scientific
or
philosophical
or
literary
or
linguistic
subject
to
reply
plausibly
to
six
questions
out
of
ten
he
could
retain
the
information
necessary
for
such
a
feat
just
long
enough
to
give
a
successful
performance
then
it
would
evaporate
utterly
from
his
brain
and
leave
him
undisturbed
george
like
his
crowd
not
only
preferred
being
things
to
doing
things
but
had
contented
himself
with
four
years
of
being
things
as
a
preparation
for
going
on
being
and
when
lucy
rather
shyly
pressed
him
for
his
probable
definition
of
the
things
it
seemed
so
superior
and
beautiful
to
be
george
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
meaning
that
she
should
have
understood
without
explanation
but
he
did
explain
oh
family
and
all
that
being
a
gentleman
i
lucy
gave
the
horizon
a
long
look
but
offered
no
comment
chapter

aunt
fanny
does
look
much
better
george
said
to
his
mother
a
few
minutes
after
their
arrival
on
the
night
they
got
home
he
stood
with
a
towel
in
her
doorway
concluding
some
sketchy
ablutions
before
going
downstairs
to
a
supper
which
fanny
was
hastily
preparing
for
them
isabel
had
not
telegraphed
fanny
was
taken
by
surprise
when
they
drove
up
in
a
station
cab
at
eleven
and
george
instantly
demanded
a
little
decent
some
criticisms
of
his
had
publicly
disturbed
the
composure
of
the
steward
four
hours
previously
i
never
saw
anybody
take
things
so
hard
as
she
seems
to
he
observed
his
voice
muffled
by
the
towel
does
she
get
over
it
at
all
i
thought
feel
better
when
we
turned
over
the
insurance
to
her
gave
it
to
her
absolutely
without
any
strings
to
it
she
looks
about
a
thousand
years
old
she
looks
quite
girlish
sometimes
though
his
mother
said
has
she
looked
that
way
much
since
father
not
so
much
isabel
said
thoughtfully
but
she
will
as
times
goes
time
have
to
hurry
then
it
seems
to
me
george
observed
returning
to
his
own
room
when
they
went
down
to
the
dining
room
he
pronounced
acceptable
the
salmon
salad
cold
beef
cheese
and
cake
which
fanny
made
ready
for
them
without
disturbing
the
servants
the
journey
had
fatigued
isabel
she
ate
nothing
but
sat
to
observe
with
tired
pleasure
the
manifestations
of
her
son
appetite
meanwhile
giving
her
a
brief
summary
of
the
events
of
commencement
but
presently
she
kissed
them
both
taking
care
to
kiss
george
lightly
upon
the
side
of
his
head
so
as
not
to
disturb
his
eating
and
left
aunt
and
nephew
alone
together
it
never
was
becoming
to
her
to
look
pale
fanny
said
absently
a
few
moments
after
isabel
departure
wha
you
say
aunt
fanny
nothing
i
suppose
your
mother
been
being
pretty
gay
going
a
lot
how
could
she
george
asked
cheerfully
in
mourning
of
course
all
she
could
do
was
just
sit
around
and
look
on
that
all
lucy
could
do
either
for
the
matter
of
i
suppose
so
his
aunt
assented
how
did
lucy
get
home
george
regarded
her
with
astonishment
why
on
the
train
with
the
rest
of
us
of
i
did
mean
that
fanny
explained
i
meant
from
the
station
did
you
drive
out
to
their
house
with
her
before
you
came
here
no
she
drove
home
with
her
father
of
oh
i
see
so
eugene
came
to
the
station
to
meet
to
meet
us
george
echoed
renewing
his
attack
upon
the
salmon
salad
how
could
he
i
do
know
what
you
mean
fanny
said
drearily
in
the
desolate
voice
that
had
become
her
habit
i
have
seen
him
while
your
mother
been
naturally
said
george
he
been
east
at
this
fanny
drooping
eyelids
opened
wide
did
you
see
him
well
naturally
since
he
made
the
trip
home
with
us
he
did
she
said
sharply
he
been
with
you
all
the
time
no
only
on
the
train
and
the
last
three
days
before
we
left
uncle
george
got
him
to
fanny
eyelids
drooped
again
and
she
sat
silent
until
george
pushed
back
his
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
declaring
his
satisfaction
with
what
she
had
provided
you
a
fine
housekeeper
he
said
benevolently
you
know
how
to
make
things
look
dainty
as
well
as
taste
the
right
way
i
do
believe
you
stay
single
very
long
if
some
of
the
bachelors
and
widowers
around
town
could
just
once
see
she
did
not
hear
him
it
a
little
odd
she
said
what
odd
your
mother
not
mentioning
that
morgan
had
been
with
did
think
of
it
i
suppose
said
george
carelessly
and
his
benevolent
mood
increasing
he
conceived
the
idea
that
a
little
harmless
rallying
might
serve
to
elevate
his
aunt
drooping
spirits
i
tell
you
something
in
confidence
he
said
solemnly
she
looked
up
startled
what
well
it
struck
me
that
morgan
was
looking
pretty
most
of
the
time
and
he
certainly
is
dressing
better
than
he
used
to
uncle
george
told
me
he
heard
that
the
automobile
factory
had
been
doing
quite
well
won
a
race
too
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
all
the
young
fellow
had
been
waiting
for
was
to
know
he
had
an
assured
income
before
he
what
fellow
this
young
fellow
morgan
laughed
george
honestly
aunt
fanny
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
to
have
him
request
an
interview
with
me
any
day
and
declare
that
his
intentions
are
honourable
and
ask
my
permission
to
pay
his
addresses
to
you
what
had
i
better
tell
him
fanny
burst
into
tears
good
heavens
george
cried
i
was
only
teasing
i
did
mean
let
me
alone
she
said
lifelessly
and
continuing
to
weep
rose
and
began
to
clear
away
the
dishes
please
aunt
fanny
just
let
me
george
was
distressed
i
did
mean
anything
aunt
fanny
i
know
you
got
so
sensitive
as
all
you
better
go
up
to
bed
she
said
desolately
going
on
with
her
work
and
her
weeping
anyhow
he
insisted
do
let
these
things
wait
let
the
servants
to
the
table
in
the
but
why
not
just
let
me
oh
lord
george
groaned
going
to
the
door
there
he
turned
see
here
aunt
fanny
there
not
a
bit
of
use
your
bothering
about
those
dishes
tonight
what
the
use
of
a
butler
and
three
maids
if
just
let
me
he
obeyed
and
could
still
hear
a
pathetic
sniffing
from
the
dining
room
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
by
george
he
grunted
as
he
reached
his
own
room
and
his
thought
was
that
living
with
a
person
so
sensitive
to
kindly
raillery
might
prove
lugubrious
he
whistled
long
and
low
then
went
to
the
window
and
looked
through
the
darkness
to
the
great
silhouette
of
his
house
lights
were
burning
over
there
upstairs
probably
his
newly
arrived
uncle
was
engaged
in
talk
with
the
major
george
glance
lowered
resting
casually
upon
the
indistinct
ground
and
he
beheld
some
vague
shapes
unfamiliar
to
him
formless
heaps
they
seemed
but
without
much
curiosity
he
supposed
that
sewer
connections
or
water
pipes
might
be
out
of
order
making
necessary
some
excavations
he
hoped
the
work
would
not
take
long
he
hated
to
see
that
sweep
of
lawn
made
unsightly
by
trenches
and
lines
of
dirt
even
temporarily
not
greatly
disturbed
however
he
pulled
down
the
shade
yawned
and
began
to
undress
leaving
further
investigation
for
the
morning
but
in
the
morning
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
raised
his
shade
to
let
in
the
light
without
even
glancing
toward
the
ground
not
until
he
had
finished
dressing
did
he
look
forth
from
his
window
and
then
his
glance
was
casual
the
next
instant
his
attitude
became
electric
and
he
gave
utterance
to
a
bellow
of
dismay
he
ran
from
his
room
plunged
down
the
stairs
out
of
the
front
door
and
upon
a
nearer
view
of
the
destroyed
lawn
began
to
release
profanity
upon
the
breezeless
summer
air
which
remained
unaffected
between
his
mother
house
and
his
grandfather
excavations
for
the
cellars
of
five
new
houses
were
in
process
each
within
a
few
feet
of
its
neighbour
foundations
of
brick
were
being
laid
everywhere
were
piles
of
brick
and
stacked
lumber
and
sand
heaps
and
mortar
beds
it
was
sunday
and
so
the
workmen
implicated
in
these
defacings
were
denied
what
unquestionably
they
would
have
considered
a
treat
but
as
the
fanatic
orator
continued
the
monologue
a
gentleman
in
flannels
emerged
upward
from
one
of
the
excavations
and
regarded
him
contemplatively
obtaining
any
relief
nephew
he
inquired
with
some
interest
you
must
have
learned
quite
a
number
of
those
expressions
in
childhood
so
long
since
i
heard
them
i
fancied
they
were
who
would
swear
george
demanded
hotly
in
the
name
of
god
what
does
grandfather
mean
doing
such
things
my
private
opinion
is
said
amberson
gravely
he
desires
to
increase
his
income
by
building
these
houses
to
well
in
the
name
of
god
ca
he
increase
his
income
any
other
way
but
this
in
the
name
of
god
it
would
appear
he
it
beastly
it
a
damn
degradation
it
a
crime
i
do
know
about
its
being
a
crime
said
his
uncle
stepping
over
some
planks
to
join
him
it
might
be
a
mistake
though
your
mother
said
not
to
tell
you
until
we
got
home
so
as
not
to
spoil
commencement
for
you
she
rather
feared
you
be
upset
oh
my
lord
i
should
think
i
would
be
upset
he
in
his
second
childhood
what
did
you
let
him
do
it
for
in
the
name
of
make
it
in
the
name
of
heaven
this
time
george
it
sunday
well
i
thought
myself
it
was
a
i
should
say
so
yes
said
amberson
i
wanted
him
to
put
up
an
apartment
building
instead
of
these
an
apartment
building
here
yes
that
was
my
george
struck
his
hands
together
despairingly
an
apartment
house
oh
my
lord
do
worry
your
grandfather
would
listen
to
me
but
he
wish
he
had
some
day
he
says
that
people
are
going
to
live
in
miserable
little
flats
when
they
can
get
a
whole
house
with
some
grass
in
front
and
plenty
of
backyard
behind
he
sticks
it
out
that
apartment
houses
will
never
do
in
a
town
of
this
type
and
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
a
dozen
or
so
of
already
are
doing
he
claimed
it
was
just
the
novelty
and
that
they
all
be
empty
as
soon
as
people
got
used
to
so
he
putting
up
these
is
he
getting
miserly
in
his
old
age
hardly
look
what
he
gave
sydney
and
amelia
i
do
mean
he
a
miser
of
course
said
george
heaven
knows
he
liberal
enough
with
mother
and
me
but
why
on
earth
did
he
sell
something
or
other
rather
than
do
a
thing
like
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
amberson
returned
coolly
i
believe
he
has
sold
something
or
other
from
time
to
well
in
heaven
name
george
cried
what
did
he
do
it
for
to
get
money
his
uncle
mildly
replied
that
my
i
suppose
you
joking
or
trying
to
that
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
amberson
said
amiably
take
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
and
in
the
meantime
if
you
have
had
your
breakfast
i
have
then
if
i
were
you
i
go
in
and
gets
some
and
he
paused
becoming
serious
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
say
anything
to
your
grandfather
about
i
do
think
i
could
trust
myself
to
speak
to
him
about
it
said
george
i
want
to
treat
him
respectfully
because
he
is
my
grandfather
but
i
do
believe
i
could
if
i
talked
to
him
about
such
a
thing
as
this
and
with
a
gesture
of
despair
plainly
signifying
that
all
too
soon
after
leaving
bright
college
years
behind
him
he
had
entered
into
the
full
tragedy
of
life
george
turned
bitterly
upon
his
heel
and
went
into
the
house
for
his
breakfast
his
uncle
with
his
head
whimsically
upon
one
side
gazed
after
him
not
altogether
unsympathetically
then
descended
again
into
the
excavation
whence
he
had
lately
emerged
being
a
philosopher
he
was
not
surprised
that
afternoon
in
the
course
of
a
drive
he
took
in
the
old
carriage
with
the
major
when
george
was
encountered
upon
the
highway
flashing
along
in
his
runabout
with
lucy
beside
him
and
pendennis
doing
better
than
three
minutes
he
seems
to
have
recovered
amberson
remarked
looks
in
the
highest
good
i
beg
your
your
grandson
amberson
explained
he
was
inclined
to
melancholy
this
morning
but
seemed
jolly
enough
just
now
when
they
passed
what
was
he
melancholy
about
not
getting
remorseful
about
all
the
money
he
spent
at
college
was
he
the
major
chuckled
feebly
but
with
sufficient
grimness
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
i
made
of
he
concluded
querulously
gold
his
son
suggested
adding
gently
and
he
right
about
part
of
you
what
part
your
the
major
laughed
ruefully
i
suppose
that
may
account
for
how
heavy
it
feels
sometimes
nowadays
this
town
seems
to
be
rolling
right
over
that
old
heart
you
mentioned
george
rolling
over
it
and
burying
it
under
when
i
think
of
those
devilish
workmen
digging
up
my
lawn
yelling
around
my
house
never
mind
father
do
think
of
it
when
things
are
a
nuisance
a
good
idea
not
to
keep
remembering
i
try
not
to
the
old
gentleman
murmured
i
try
to
keep
remembering
that
i
wo
be
remembering
anything
very
and
somehow
convinced
that
this
thought
was
a
mirthful
one
he
laughed
loudly
and
slapped
his
knee
not
so
very
long
now
my
boy
he
chuckled
continuing
to
echo
his
own
amusement
not
so
very
long
not
so
very
long
chapter
xvii
young
george
paid
his
respects
to
his
grandfather
the
following
morning
having
been
occupied
with
various
affairs
and
engagements
on
sunday
until
after
the
major
bedtime
and
topics
concerned
with
building
or
excavations
were
not
introduced
into
the
conversation
which
was
a
cheerful
one
until
george
lightly
mentioned
some
new
plans
of
his
he
was
a
skillful
driver
as
the
major
knew
and
he
spoke
of
his
desire
to
extend
his
proficiency
in
this
art
in
fact
be
entertained
the
ambition
to
drive
a
however
as
the
major
said
nothing
and
merely
sat
still
looking
surprised
george
went
on
to
say
that
he
did
not
propose
to
go
in
for
coaching
just
at
the
start
he
thought
it
would
be
better
to
begin
with
a
tandem
he
was
sure
pendennis
could
be
trained
to
work
as
a
leader
and
all
that
one
needed
to
buy
at
present
he
said
would
be
comparatively
inexpensive
a
new
trap
and
the
harness
of
course
and
a
good
bay
to
match
he
did
not
care
for
a
special
groom
one
of
the
stablemen
would
do
at
this
point
the
major
decided
to
speak
you
say
one
of
the
stablemen
would
do
he
inquired
his
widened
eyes
remaining
fixed
upon
his
grandson
that
lucky
because
one
all
there
is
just
at
present
george
old
fat
tom
does
it
all
did
you
notice
when
you
took
pendennis
out
yesterday
oh
that
will
be
all
right
sir
my
mother
can
lend
me
her
can
she
the
old
gentleman
smiled
faintly
i
wonder
he
paused
what
sir
whether
you
might
care
to
go
to
somewhere
perhaps
i
be
glad
to
set
aside
a
sum
that
would
see
you
this
senile
divergence
from
the
topic
in
hand
surprised
george
painfully
i
have
no
interest
whatever
in
the
law
he
said
i
care
for
it
and
the
idea
of
being
a
professional
man
has
never
appealed
to
me
none
of
the
family
has
ever
gone
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
to
my
knowledge
and
i
do
care
to
be
the
first
i
was
speaking
of
driving
a
tandem
i
know
you
were
the
major
said
quietly
george
looked
hurt
i
beg
your
pardon
of
course
if
the
idea
appeal
to
you
and
he
rose
to
go
the
major
ran
a
tremulous
hand
through
his
hair
sighing
deeply
i
i
do
like
to
refuse
you
anything
georgie
he
said
i
do
know
that
i
often
have
refused
you
whatever
you
wanted
in
reason
you
always
been
more
than
generous
sir
george
interrupted
quickly
and
if
the
idea
of
a
tandem
does
appeal
to
you
why
of
course
and
he
waved
his
hand
heroically
dismissing
the
tandem
the
major
distress
became
obvious
georgie
i
like
to
but
but
i
an
idea
tandems
are
dangerous
to
drive
and
your
mother
might
be
anxious
she
no
sir
i
think
not
she
felt
it
would
be
rather
a
good
thing
help
to
keep
me
out
in
the
open
air
but
if
perhaps
your
finances
oh
it
is
that
so
much
the
old
gentleman
said
hurriedly
i
thinking
of
that
he
laughed
uncomfortably
i
guess
we
could
still
afford
a
new
horse
or
two
if
need
be
i
thought
you
said
the
major
waved
his
hand
airily
oh
a
few
retrenchments
where
things
were
useless
nothing
gained
by
a
raft
of
idle
darkies
in
the
stable
nor
by
a
lot
of
extra
land
that
might
as
well
be
put
to
work
for
us
in
rentals
and
if
you
want
this
thing
so
very
much
it
not
important
enough
to
bother
about
really
of
well
let
wait
till
autumn
then
said
the
major
in
a
tone
of
relief
we
see
about
it
in
the
autumn
if
you
still
in
the
mind
for
it
then
that
will
be
a
great
deal
better
you
remind
me
of
it
along
in
september
or
october
we
see
what
can
be
he
rubbed
his
hands
cheerfully
we
see
what
can
be
done
about
it
then
georgie
and
george
in
reporting
this
conversation
to
his
mother
was
ruefully
humorous
in
fact
the
old
boy
cheered
up
so
much
he
told
her
have
thought
he
got
a
real
load
off
his
mind
he
seemed
to
think
fixed
me
up
perfectly
and
that
i
was
just
as
good
as
driving
a
tandem
around
his
library
right
that
minute
of
course
i
know
he
anything
but
miserly
still
i
ca
help
thinking
he
must
be
salting
a
lot
of
money
away
i
know
prices
are
higher
than
they
used
to
be
but
he
spend
within
thousands
of
what
he
used
to
and
we
certainly
ca
be
spending
more
than
we
always
have
spent
where
does
it
all
go
to
uncle
george
told
me
grandfather
had
sold
some
pieces
of
property
and
it
looks
a
little
queer
if
he
really
poor
of
course
we
ought
to
be
more
saving
than
we
are
and
help
him
out
i
do
mind
giving
up
a
tandem
if
it
seems
a
little
too
expensive
just
now
i
perfectly
willing
to
live
quietly
till
he
gets
his
bank
balance
where
he
wants
it
but
i
have
a
faint
suspicion
not
that
he
getting
miserly
not
that
at
all
but
that
old
age
has
begun
to
make
him
timid
about
money
no
doubt
about
it
he
getting
a
little
queer
he
ca
keep
his
mind
on
a
subject
long
right
in
the
middle
of
talking
about
one
thing
wander
off
to
something
else
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
turned
out
to
be
a
lot
better
off
than
any
of
us
guess
it
entirely
possible
that
whatever
he
sold
just
went
into
government
bonds
or
even
his
safety
deposit
box
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
in
college
had
an
old
uncle
like
that
made
the
whole
family
think
he
was
poor
as
dirt
and
then
left
seven
millions
people
get
terribly
queer
as
they
get
old
sometimes
and
grandfather
certainly
does
act
the
way
he
used
to
he
seems
to
be
a
totally
different
man
for
instance
he
said
he
thought
tandem
driving
might
be
dangerous
did
he
isabel
asked
quickly
then
i
glad
he
does
want
you
to
have
one
i
did
dream
but
it
not
there
is
the
slightest
isabel
had
a
bright
idea
georgie
instead
of
a
tandem
would
it
interest
you
to
get
one
of
eugene
automobiles
i
do
think
so
they
fast
enough
of
course
in
fact
running
one
of
those
things
is
getting
to
be
quite
on
the
cards
for
sport
and
people
go
all
over
the
country
in
but
they
dirty
things
and
they
keep
getting
out
of
order
so
that
you
always
lying
down
on
your
back
in
the
mud
and
oh
no
she
interrupted
eagerly
have
you
noticed
you
do
see
nearly
so
many
people
doing
that
nowadays
as
you
did
two
or
three
years
ago
and
when
you
do
eugene
says
it
apt
to
be
one
of
the
older
patterns
the
way
they
make
them
now
you
can
get
at
most
of
the
machinery
from
the
top
i
do
think
you
be
interested
george
remained
indifferent
possibly
but
i
hardly
think
so
i
know
a
lot
of
good
people
are
really
taking
them
up
but
still
but
still
what
she
said
as
he
paused
but
still
well
i
suppose
i
a
little
and
fastidious
but
i
afraid
being
a
sort
of
engine
driver
never
will
appeal
to
me
mother
it
exciting
and
i
like
that
part
of
it
but
still
it
does
seem
to
me
precisely
the
thing
a
gentleman
ought
to
do
too
much
overalls
and
and
grease
but
eugene
says
people
are
hiring
mechanics
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
them
they
beginning
to
have
them
just
the
way
they
have
coachmen
and
he
says
it
developing
into
quite
a
i
know
that
mother
of
course
but
i
seen
some
of
these
mechanics
and
they
not
very
satisfactory
for
one
thing
most
of
them
only
pretend
to
understand
the
machinery
and
they
let
people
break
down
a
hundred
miles
from
nowhere
so
that
about
all
these
fellows
are
good
for
is
to
hunt
up
a
farmer
and
hire
a
horse
to
pull
the
automobile
and
friends
of
mine
at
college
that
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
tell
me
the
mechanics
who
do
understand
the
engines
have
no
training
at
all
as
servants
they
awful
they
say
anything
they
like
and
usually
speak
to
members
of
the
family
as
no
i
believe
i
rather
wait
for
september
and
a
tandem
nevertheless
george
sometimes
consented
to
sit
in
an
automobile
while
waiting
for
september
and
he
frequently
went
driving
in
one
of
cars
with
lucy
and
her
father
he
even
allowed
himself
to
be
escorted
with
his
mother
and
fanny
through
the
growing
factory
which
was
now
as
the
foreman
of
the
paint
shop
informed
the
visitors
turning
out
a
car
and
a
quarter
a
george
had
seldom
been
more
excessively
bored
but
his
mother
showed
a
lively
interest
in
everything
wishing
to
have
all
the
machinery
explained
to
her
it
was
lucy
who
did
most
of
the
explaining
while
her
father
looked
on
and
laughed
at
the
mistakes
she
made
and
fanny
remained
in
the
background
with
george
exhibiting
a
bleakness
that
overmatched
his
boredom
from
the
factory
eugene
took
them
to
lunch
at
a
new
restaurant
just
opened
in
the
town
a
place
which
surprised
isabel
with
its
metropolitan
air
and
though
george
made
fun
of
it
to
her
in
a
whisper
she
offered
everything
the
tribute
of
pleased
exclamations
and
her
gayety
helped
eugene
to
make
the
little
occasion
almost
a
festive
one
george
ennui
disappeared
in
spite
of
himself
and
he
laughed
to
see
his
mother
in
such
spirits
i
did
know
mineral
waters
could
go
to
a
person
head
he
said
or
perhaps
it
this
place
it
might
pay
to
have
a
new
restaurant
opened
somewhere
in
town
every
time
you
get
the
fanny
turned
to
him
with
a
wan
smile
oh
she
does
the
blues
george
then
she
added
as
if
fearing
her
remark
might
be
thought
unpleasantly
significant
i
never
knew
a
person
of
a
more
even
disposition
i
wish
i
could
be
like
that
and
though
the
tone
of
this
afterthought
was
not
so
enthusiastic
as
she
tried
to
make
it
she
succeeded
in
producing
a
fairly
amiable
effect
no
isabel
said
reverting
to
george
remark
and
overlooking
fanny
what
makes
me
laugh
so
much
at
nothing
is
eugene
factory
would
anybody
be
delighted
to
see
an
old
friend
take
an
idea
out
of
the
air
like
that
an
idea
that
most
people
laughed
at
him
for
any
old
friend
of
his
be
happy
to
see
how
he
made
his
idea
into
such
a
splendid
humming
thing
as
that
factory
all
shiny
steel
clicking
and
buzzing
away
and
with
all
those
workmen
such
muscled
looking
men
and
yet
so
intelligent
looking
hear
hear
george
applauded
we
seem
to
have
a
lady
orator
among
us
i
hope
the
waiters
wo
isabel
laughed
not
discouraged
it
beautiful
to
see
such
a
thing
she
said
it
makes
us
all
happy
dear
old
eugene
and
with
a
brave
gesture
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
across
the
small
table
he
took
it
quickly
giving
her
a
look
in
which
his
laughter
tried
to
remain
but
vanished
before
a
gratitude
threatening
to
become
emotional
in
spite
of
him
isabel
however
turned
instantly
to
fanny
give
him
your
hand
fanny
she
said
gayly
and
as
fanny
mechanically
obeyed
there
isabel
cried
if
brother
george
were
here
eugene
would
have
his
three
oldest
and
best
friends
congratulating
him
all
at
once
we
know
what
brother
george
thinks
about
it
though
it
just
beautiful
eugene
probably
if
her
brother
george
had
been
with
them
at
the
little
table
he
would
have
made
known
what
he
thought
about
herself
for
it
must
inevitably
have
struck
him
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
times
when
she
looked
exactly
fourteen
years
lucy
served
as
a
proxy
for
amberson
perhaps
when
she
leaned
toward
george
and
whispered
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
lovely
as
what
george
inquired
not
because
he
misunderstood
but
because
he
wished
to
prolong
the
pleasant
neighbourliness
of
whispering
as
your
mother
think
of
her
doing
that
she
a
darling
and
papa
here
she
imperfectly
repressed
a
tendency
to
laugh
papa
looks
as
if
he
were
either
going
to
explode
or
utter
loud
sobs
eugene
commanded
his
features
however
and
they
resumed
their
customary
apprehensiveness
i
used
to
write
verse
he
said
if
you
remember
yes
isabel
interrupted
gently
i
i
do
recall
that
i
written
any
for
twenty
years
or
so
he
continued
but
i
almost
thinking
i
could
do
it
again
to
thank
you
for
making
a
factory
visit
into
such
a
kind
gracious
lucy
whispered
giggling
are
they
sentimental
people
that
age
always
are
george
returned
they
get
sentimental
over
anything
at
all
factories
or
restaurants
it
does
matter
what
and
both
of
them
were
seized
with
fits
of
laughter
which
they
managed
to
cover
under
the
general
movement
of
departure
as
isabel
had
risen
to
go
outside
upon
the
crowded
street
george
helped
lucy
into
his
runabout
and
drove
off
waving
triumphantly
and
laughing
at
eugene
who
was
struggling
with
the
engine
of
his
car
in
the
tonneau
of
which
isabel
and
fanny
had
established
themselves
looks
like
a
man
grinding
away
for
pennies
said
george
as
the
runabout
turned
the
corner
and
into
national
avenue
i
still
take
a
horse
any
he
was
not
so
cocksure
half
an
hour
later
on
an
open
road
when
a
siren
whistle
wailed
behind
him
and
before
the
sound
had
died
away
eugene
car
coming
from
behind
with
what
seemed
fairly
like
one
long
leap
went
by
the
runabout
and
dwindled
almost
instantaneously
in
perspective
with
a
lace
handkerchief
in
a
hand
fluttering
sweet
derision
as
it
was
swept
onward
into
minuteness
a
mere
white
speck
and
then
out
of
sight
george
was
undoubtedly
impressed
your
father
does
know
how
to
drive
some
the
dashing
exhibition
forced
him
to
admit
of
course
pendennis
is
as
young
as
he
was
and
i
do
care
to
push
him
too
hard
i
would
mind
handling
one
of
those
machines
on
the
road
like
that
myself
if
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
no
cranking
to
do
or
fooling
with
the
engine
well
i
enjoyed
part
of
that
lunch
quite
a
lot
the
salad
no
your
whispering
to
blarney
george
made
no
response
but
checked
pendennis
to
a
walk
whereupon
lucy
protested
quickly
oh
do
why
do
you
want
him
to
trot
his
legs
off
no
but
no
but
what
she
spoke
with
apparent
gravity
i
know
when
you
make
him
walk
it
so
you
can
give
all
your
attention
to
to
proposing
to
me
again
and
as
she
turned
a
face
of
exaggerated
color
to
him
by
the
lord
but
you
a
little
witch
george
cried
george
do
let
pendennis
trot
again
i
wo
she
clucked
to
the
horse
get
up
pendennis
trot
go
on
commence
pendennis
paid
no
attention
she
meant
nothing
to
him
and
george
laughed
at
her
fondly
you
are
the
prettiest
thing
in
this
world
lucy
he
exclaimed
when
i
see
you
in
winter
in
furs
with
your
cheeks
red
i
think
you
prettiest
then
but
when
i
see
you
in
summer
in
a
straw
hat
and
a
shirtwaist
and
a
duck
skirt
and
white
gloves
and
those
little
silver
buckled
slippers
and
your
parasol
and
your
cheeks
not
red
but
with
a
kind
of
pinky
glow
about
them
then
i
see
i
must
have
been
wrong
about
the
winter
when
are
you
going
to
drop
the
and
say
we
really
engaged
oh
not
for
years
so
there
the
answer
and
let
trot
but
george
was
persistent
moreover
he
had
become
serious
during
the
last
minute
or
two
i
want
to
know
he
said
i
really
mean
let
do
be
serious
george
she
begged
him
hopefully
let
talk
of
something
he
was
a
little
offended
then
it
is
pleasant
for
you
to
know
that
i
want
to
marry
you
at
this
she
became
as
serious
as
he
could
have
asked
she
looked
down
and
her
lip
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
cry
suddenly
she
put
her
hand
upon
one
of
his
for
just
an
instant
and
then
withdrew
it
lucy
he
said
huskily
dear
what
the
matter
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
cry
you
always
do
that
he
went
on
plaintively
whenever
i
can
get
you
to
talk
about
marrying
i
know
it
she
murmured
well
why
do
you
her
eyelids
flickered
and
then
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sad
gravity
tears
seeming
just
at
the
poise
one
reason
because
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
never
going
to
why
it
just
a
you
have
any
reason
or
it
just
a
well
if
that
all
george
said
reassured
and
laughing
confidently
i
guess
i
wo
be
very
much
troubled
but
at
once
he
became
serious
again
adopting
the
tone
of
argument
lucy
how
is
anything
ever
going
to
get
a
chance
to
come
of
it
so
long
as
you
keep
sticking
to
does
it
strike
you
as
unreasonable
to
have
a
that
never
be
married
when
what
principally
stands
between
us
is
the
fact
that
you
wo
be
really
engaged
to
me
that
does
seem
pretty
absurd
do
you
care
enough
about
me
to
marry
me
she
looked
down
again
pathetically
troubled
wo
you
always
care
that
much
about
me
i
yes
i
afraid
so
george
i
never
do
change
much
about
well
then
why
in
the
world
wo
you
drop
the
her
distress
increased
everything
is
everything
what
about
everything
is
so
so
and
at
that
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
impatience
if
you
are
the
queerest
girl
what
is
well
for
one
thing
she
said
able
to
smile
at
his
vehemence
you
have
settled
on
anything
to
do
at
least
if
you
have
you
never
spoken
of
as
she
spoke
she
gave
him
the
quickest
possible
side
glance
of
hopeful
scrutiny
then
looked
away
not
happily
surprise
and
displeasure
were
intentionally
visible
upon
the
countenance
of
her
companion
and
he
permitted
a
significant
period
of
silence
to
elapse
before
making
any
response
lucy
he
said
finally
with
cold
dignity
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
yes
the
first
is
have
you
perfectly
well
understood
that
i
do
mean
to
go
into
business
or
adopt
a
profession
i
was
quite
sure
she
said
gently
i
really
did
know
then
of
course
it
time
i
did
tell
you
i
never
have
been
able
to
see
any
occasion
for
a
man
going
into
trade
or
being
a
lawyer
or
any
of
those
things
if
his
position
and
family
were
such
that
he
did
need
to
you
know
yourself
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
east
in
the
south
too
for
that
matter
that
do
think
we
got
any
particular
family
or
position
or
culture
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
met
plenty
of
that
kind
of
provincial
snobs
myself
and
they
pretty
galling
there
were
one
or
two
men
in
my
crowd
at
college
their
families
had
lived
on
their
income
for
three
generations
and
they
never
dreamed
there
was
anybody
in
their
class
out
here
i
had
to
show
them
a
thing
or
two
right
at
the
start
and
i
guess
they
wo
forget
it
well
i
think
it
time
all
their
sort
found
out
that
three
generations
can
mean
just
as
much
out
here
as
anywhere
else
that
the
way
i
feel
about
it
and
let
me
tell
you
i
feel
it
pretty
deeply
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
george
she
cried
george
earnestness
surpassed
hers
he
had
become
flushed
and
his
breathing
was
emotional
as
he
confessed
with
simple
genuineness
he
did
feel
what
he
was
saying
pretty
deeply
and
in
truth
his
state
approached
the
tremulous
i
expect
to
live
an
honourable
life
he
said
i
expect
to
contribute
my
share
to
charities
and
to
take
part
in
in
what
kind
whatever
appeals
to
me
he
said
lucy
looked
at
him
with
grieved
wonder
but
you
really
do
mean
to
have
any
regular
business
or
profession
at
all
i
certainly
do
not
george
returned
promptly
and
emphatically
i
was
afraid
so
she
said
in
a
low
voice
george
continued
to
breathe
deeply
throughout
another
protracted
interval
of
silence
then
he
said
i
should
like
to
revert
to
the
questions
i
was
asking
you
if
you
do
no
george
i
think
we
better
your
father
is
a
business
man
he
a
mechanical
genius
lucy
interrupted
quickly
of
course
both
and
he
was
a
lawyer
once
he
done
all
sorts
of
very
well
i
merely
wished
to
ask
if
it
his
influence
that
makes
you
think
i
ought
to
something
lucy
frowned
slightly
why
i
suppose
almost
everything
i
think
or
say
must
be
owing
to
his
influence
in
one
way
or
another
we
have
had
anybody
but
each
other
for
so
many
years
and
we
always
think
about
alike
so
of
course
i
see
and
george
brow
darkened
with
resentment
so
that
it
is
it
it
your
father
idea
that
i
ought
to
go
into
business
and
that
you
ought
to
be
engaged
to
me
until
i
lucy
gave
a
start
her
denial
was
so
quick
no
i
never
once
spoken
to
him
about
it
never
george
looked
at
her
keenly
and
he
jumped
to
a
conclusion
not
far
from
the
truth
but
you
know
without
talking
to
him
that
it
the
way
he
does
feel
about
it
i
she
nodded
gravely
george
brow
grew
darker
still
do
you
think
i
be
much
of
a
man
he
said
slowly
if
i
let
any
other
man
dictate
to
me
my
own
way
of
life
george
who
your
it
seems
to
me
it
amounts
to
that
he
returned
oh
no
i
only
know
how
papa
thinks
about
things
he
never
never
spoken
unkindly
or
of
she
lifted
her
hand
in
protest
and
her
face
was
so
touching
in
its
distress
that
for
the
moment
george
forgot
his
anger
he
seized
that
small
troubled
hand
lucy
he
said
huskily
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
yes
i
do
you
love
me
yes
i
then
what
does
it
matter
what
your
father
thinks
about
my
doing
something
or
not
doing
anything
he
has
his
way
and
i
have
mine
i
do
believe
in
the
whole
world
scrubbing
dishes
and
selling
potatoes
and
trying
law
cases
why
look
at
your
father
best
friend
my
uncle
george
amberson
he
never
done
anything
in
his
life
and
oh
yes
he
has
she
interrupted
he
was
in
well
i
glad
he
out
george
said
politics
is
a
dirty
business
for
a
gentleman
and
uncle
george
would
tell
you
that
himself
lucy
let
not
talk
any
more
about
it
let
me
tell
mother
when
i
get
home
that
we
engaged
wo
you
dear
she
shook
her
head
is
it
because
for
a
fleeting
instant
she
touched
to
her
cheek
the
hand
that
held
hers
no
she
said
and
gave
him
a
sudden
little
look
of
renewed
gayety
let
let
it
stay
because
your
father
oh
because
it
better
george
voice
shook
is
it
your
father
it
his
ideals
i
thinking
of
george
dropped
her
hand
abruptly
and
anger
narrowed
his
eyes
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
i
dare
say
i
do
care
for
your
ideals
any
more
than
he
does
for
mine
he
tightened
the
reins
pendennis
quickening
eagerly
to
the
trot
and
when
george
jumped
out
of
the
runabout
before
lucy
gate
and
assisted
her
to
descend
the
silence
in
which
they
parted
was
the
same
that
had
begun
when
pendennis
began
to
trot
chapter
xviii
that
evening
after
dinner
george
sat
with
his
mother
and
his
aunt
fanny
upon
the
veranda
in
former
summers
when
they
sat
outdoors
in
the
evening
they
had
customarily
used
an
open
terrace
at
the
side
of
the
house
looking
toward
the
major
but
that
more
private
retreat
now
afforded
too
blank
and
abrupt
a
view
of
the
nearest
of
the
new
houses
so
without
consultation
they
had
abandoned
it
for
the
romanesque
stone
structure
in
front
an
oppressive
place
its
oppression
seemed
congenial
to
george
he
sat
upon
the
copestone
of
the
stone
parapet
his
back
against
a
stone
pilaster
his
attitude
not
comfortable
but
rigid
and
his
silence
not
comfortable
either
but
heavy
however
to
the
eyes
of
his
mother
and
his
aunt
who
occupied
wicker
chairs
at
a
little
distance
he
was
almost
indistinguishable
except
for
the
stiff
white
shield
of
his
evening
frontage
it
so
nice
of
you
always
to
dress
in
the
evening
georgie
his
mother
said
her
glance
resting
upon
this
surface
your
uncle
george
always
used
to
and
so
did
father
for
years
but
they
both
stopped
quite
a
long
time
ago
unless
there
some
special
occasion
it
seems
to
me
we
do
see
it
done
any
more
except
on
the
stage
and
in
the
he
made
no
response
and
isabel
after
waiting
a
little
while
as
if
she
expected
one
appeared
to
acquiesce
in
his
mood
for
silence
and
turned
her
head
to
gaze
thoughtfully
out
at
the
street
there
in
the
highway
the
evening
life
of
the
midland
city
had
begun
a
rising
moon
was
bright
upon
the
tops
of
the
shade
trees
where
their
branches
met
overhead
arching
across
the
street
but
only
filtered
splashings
of
moonlight
reached
the
block
pavement
below
and
through
this
darkness
flashed
the
firefly
lights
of
silent
bicycles
gliding
by
in
pairs
and
trios
or
sometimes
a
dozen
at
a
time
might
come
and
not
so
silent
striking
their
little
bells
the
riders
voices
calling
and
laughing
while
now
and
then
a
pair
of
invisible
experts
would
pass
playing
mandolin
and
guitar
as
if
were
of
no
account
in
the
world
their
music
would
come
swiftly
and
then
too
swiftly
die
away
surreys
rumbled
lightly
by
with
the
of
honest
old
horses
and
frequently
there
was
the
glitter
of
whizzing
spokes
from
a
runabout
or
a
sporting
buggy
and
the
sharp
decisive
of
a
trotter
then
like
a
cowboy
shooting
up
a
peaceful
camp
a
frantic
devil
would
hurtle
out
of
the
distance
bellowing
exhaust
racketing
like
a
machine
gun
gone
amuck
and
at
these
horrid
sounds
the
surreys
and
buggies
would
hug
the
curbstone
and
the
bicycles
scatter
to
cover
cursing
while
children
rushed
from
the
sidewalks
to
drag
pet
dogs
from
the
street
the
thing
would
roar
by
leaving
a
long
wake
of
turbulence
then
the
indignant
street
would
quiet
down
for
a
few
minutes
till
another
came
there
are
a
great
many
more
than
there
used
to
be
miss
fanny
observed
in
her
lifeless
voice
as
the
lull
fell
after
one
of
these
visitations
eugene
is
right
about
that
there
seem
to
be
at
least
three
or
four
times
as
many
as
there
were
last
summer
and
you
never
hear
the
ragamuffins
shouting
a
horse
nowadays
but
i
think
he
may
be
mistaken
about
their
going
on
increasing
after
this
i
believe
we
see
so
many
next
summer
as
we
do
why
asked
isabel
because
i
begun
to
agree
with
george
about
their
being
more
a
fad
than
anything
else
and
i
think
it
must
be
the
height
of
the
fad
just
now
you
know
how
came
in
everybody
in
the
world
seemed
to
be
crowding
to
the
rinks
and
now
only
a
few
children
use
rollers
for
getting
to
school
besides
people
wo
permit
the
automobiles
to
be
used
really
i
think
they
make
laws
against
them
you
see
how
they
spoil
the
bicycling
and
the
driving
people
just
seem
to
hate
them
they
never
stand
it
never
in
the
world
of
course
i
be
sorry
to
see
such
a
thing
happen
to
eugene
but
i
should
be
really
surprised
to
see
a
law
passed
forbidding
the
sale
of
automobiles
just
the
way
there
is
with
concealed
fanny
exclaimed
her
you
not
in
earnest
i
am
though
isabel
laugh
came
out
of
the
dusk
where
she
sat
then
you
did
mean
it
when
you
told
eugene
you
enjoyed
the
drive
this
afternoon
i
did
say
it
so
very
enthusiastically
did
i
perhaps
not
but
he
certainly
thought
he
pleased
i
do
think
i
gave
him
any
right
to
think
he
pleased
me
fanny
said
slowly
why
not
why
should
you
fanny
fanny
did
not
reply
at
once
and
when
she
did
her
voice
was
almost
inaudible
but
much
more
reproachful
than
plaintive
i
hardly
think
want
any
one
to
get
the
notion
he
pleased
me
just
now
it
hardly
seems
time
yet
to
isabel
made
no
response
and
for
a
time
the
only
sound
upon
the
dark
veranda
was
the
creaking
of
the
wicker
in
which
fanny
sat
a
creaking
which
seemed
to
denote
content
and
placidity
on
the
part
of
the
chair
occupant
though
at
this
juncture
a
series
of
human
shrieks
could
have
been
little
more
eloquent
of
emotional
disturbance
however
the
creaking
gave
its
hearer
one
great
advantage
it
could
be
ignored
have
you
given
up
smoking
george
isabel
asked
presently
i
hoped
perhaps
you
had
because
you
not
smoked
since
dinner
we
sha
mind
if
you
care
no
there
was
silence
again
except
for
the
creaking
of
the
then
a
low
clear
whistle
singularly
musical
was
heard
softly
rendering
an
old
air
from
fra
the
creaking
stopped
is
that
you
george
fanny
asked
abruptly
is
that
me
what
whistling
yonder
rock
reclining
it
i
said
isabel
oh
fanny
said
dryly
does
it
disturb
you
not
at
all
i
had
an
idea
george
was
depressed
about
something
and
merely
wondered
if
he
could
be
making
such
a
cheerful
and
fanny
resumed
her
creaking
is
she
right
george
his
mother
asked
quickly
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
to
peer
at
him
through
the
dusk
you
did
eat
a
very
hearty
dinner
but
i
thought
it
was
probably
because
of
the
warm
weather
are
you
troubled
about
anything
no
he
said
angrily
that
good
i
thought
we
had
such
a
nice
day
did
you
i
suppose
so
he
muttered
and
satisfied
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
but
fra
diavolo
was
not
revived
after
a
time
she
rose
went
to
the
steps
and
stood
for
several
minutes
looking
across
the
street
then
her
laughter
was
faintly
heard
are
you
laughing
about
something
fanny
inquired
pardon
isabel
did
not
turn
but
continued
her
observation
of
what
had
interested
her
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
i
asked
were
you
laughing
at
something
yes
i
was
and
she
laughed
again
it
that
funny
fat
old
johnson
she
has
a
habit
of
sitting
at
her
bedroom
window
with
a
pair
of
really
really
you
can
see
the
window
through
the
place
that
was
left
when
we
had
the
dead
walnut
tree
cut
down
she
looks
up
and
down
the
street
but
mostly
at
father
and
over
here
sometimes
she
forgets
to
put
out
the
light
in
her
room
and
there
she
is
spying
away
for
all
the
world
to
see
however
fanny
made
no
effort
to
observe
this
spectacle
but
continued
her
creaking
i
always
thought
her
a
very
good
woman
she
said
primly
so
she
is
isabel
agreed
she
a
good
friendly
old
thing
a
little
too
intimate
in
her
manner
sometimes
and
if
her
poor
old
afford
her
the
quiet
happiness
of
knowing
what
sort
of
young
man
our
new
cook
is
walking
out
with
i
the
last
to
begrudge
it
to
her
do
you
want
to
come
and
look
at
her
george
what
i
beg
your
pardon
i
had
noticed
what
you
were
talking
it
nothing
she
laughed
only
a
funny
old
lady
and
she
gone
now
i
going
too
at
least
i
going
indoors
to
read
it
cooler
in
the
house
but
the
heat
really
not
bad
anywhere
since
nightfall
dying
how
quickly
it
goes
once
it
begins
to
when
she
had
gone
into
the
house
fanny
stopped
rocking
and
leaning
forward
drew
her
black
gauze
wrap
about
her
shoulders
and
shivered
is
it
queer
she
said
drearily
how
your
mother
can
use
such
words
what
words
are
you
talking
about
george
asked
words
like
and
i
do
see
how
she
can
bear
to
use
them
so
soon
after
your
poor
father
she
shivered
again
it
almost
a
year
george
said
absently
and
he
added
it
seems
to
me
you
using
them
i
never
yes
you
when
just
this
oh
said
fanny
you
mean
when
i
repeated
what
she
said
that
hardly
the
same
thing
he
was
not
enough
interested
to
argue
the
point
i
do
think
convince
anybody
that
mother
unfeeling
he
said
indifferently
i
not
trying
to
convince
anybody
i
mean
merely
that
in
my
opinion
well
perhaps
it
may
be
just
as
wise
for
me
to
keep
my
opinions
to
she
paused
expectantly
but
her
possible
anticipation
that
george
would
urge
her
to
discard
wisdom
and
reveal
her
opinion
was
not
fulfilled
his
back
was
toward
her
and
he
occupied
himself
with
opinions
of
his
own
about
other
matters
fanny
may
have
felt
some
disappointment
as
she
rose
to
withdraw
however
at
the
last
moment
she
halted
with
her
hand
upon
the
latch
of
the
screen
door
there
one
thing
i
hope
she
said
i
hope
at
least
she
wo
leave
off
her
full
mourning
on
the
very
anniversary
of
wilbur
death
the
light
door
clanged
behind
her
and
the
sound
annoyed
her
nephew
he
had
no
idea
why
she
thus
used
inoffensive
wood
and
wire
to
dramatize
her
departure
from
the
veranda
the
impression
remaining
with
him
being
that
she
was
critical
of
his
mother
upon
some
point
of
funeral
millinery
throughout
the
desultory
conversation
he
had
been
profoundly
concerned
with
his
own
disturbing
affairs
and
now
was
preoccupied
with
a
dialogue
taking
place
in
his
mind
between
himself
and
miss
lucy
morgan
as
he
beheld
the
vision
lucy
had
just
thrown
herself
at
his
feet
george
you
must
forgive
me
she
cried
papa
was
utterly
wrong
i
have
told
him
so
and
the
truth
is
that
i
have
come
to
rather
dislike
him
as
you
do
and
as
you
always
have
in
your
heart
of
hearts
george
i
understand
you
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
gods
my
gods
george
wo
you
take
me
back
lucy
are
you
sure
you
understand
me
and
in
the
darkness
bodily
lips
moved
in
unison
with
those
which
uttered
the
words
in
his
imaginary
rendering
of
this
scene
an
eavesdropper
concealed
behind
the
column
could
have
heard
the
whispered
word
sure
the
emphasis
put
upon
it
in
the
vision
was
so
poignant
you
say
you
understand
me
but
are
you
sure
weeping
her
head
bowed
almost
to
her
waist
the
ethereal
lucy
made
reply
oh
so
sure
i
will
never
listen
to
father
opinions
again
i
do
not
even
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
then
i
pardon
you
he
said
gently
this
softened
mood
lasted
for
several
moments
until
he
realized
that
it
had
been
brought
about
by
processes
strikingly
lacking
in
substance
abruptly
he
swung
his
feet
down
from
the
copestone
to
the
floor
of
the
veranda
pardon
nothing
no
meek
lucy
had
thrown
herself
in
remorse
at
his
feet
and
now
he
pictured
her
as
she
probably
really
was
at
this
moment
sitting
on
the
white
steps
of
her
own
front
porch
in
the
moonlight
with
fred
kinney
and
silly
charlie
johnson
and
four
or
five
others
all
of
them
laughing
most
likely
and
some
idiot
playing
the
guitar
george
spoke
aloud
riffraff
and
because
of
an
impish
but
all
too
natural
reaction
of
the
mind
he
could
see
lucy
with
much
greater
distinctness
in
this
vision
than
in
his
former
pleasing
one
for
a
moment
she
was
miraculously
real
before
him
every
line
and
colour
of
her
he
saw
the
moonlight
shimmering
in
the
chiffon
of
her
skirts
brightest
on
her
crossed
knee
and
the
tip
of
her
slipper
saw
the
blue
curve
of
the
characteristic
shadow
behind
her
as
she
leaned
back
against
the
white
step
saw
the
watery
twinkling
of
sequins
in
the
gauze
wrap
over
her
white
shoulders
as
she
moved
and
the
faint
symmetrical
lights
in
her
black
hair
and
not
one
alluring
exasperating
of
her
laughing
profile
was
spared
him
as
she
seemed
to
turn
to
the
infernal
kinney
riffraff
and
george
began
furiously
to
pace
the
stone
floor
riffraff
by
this
hard
term
a
favourite
with
him
since
scornful
hour
he
meant
to
indicate
not
lucy
but
the
young
gentlemen
who
in
his
vision
surrounded
her
riffraff
he
said
again
aloud
and
again
riffraff
at
that
moment
as
it
happened
lucy
was
playing
chess
with
her
father
and
her
heart
though
not
remorseful
was
as
heavy
as
george
could
have
wished
but
she
did
not
let
eugene
see
that
she
was
troubled
and
he
was
pleased
when
he
won
three
games
of
her
usually
she
beat
him
chapter
xix
george
went
driving
the
next
afternoon
alone
and
encountering
lucy
and
her
father
on
the
road
in
one
of
morgan
cars
lifted
his
hat
but
nowise
relaxed
his
formal
countenance
as
they
passed
eugene
waved
a
cordial
hand
quickly
returned
to
the
but
lucy
only
nodded
gravely
and
smiled
no
more
than
george
did
nor
did
she
accompany
eugene
to
the
major
for
dinner
the
following
sunday
evening
though
both
were
bidden
to
attend
that
feast
which
was
already
reduced
in
numbers
and
gayety
by
the
absence
of
george
amberson
eugene
explained
to
his
host
that
lucy
had
gone
away
to
visit
a
the
information
delivered
in
the
library
just
before
old
appearance
to
announce
dinner
set
miss
minafer
in
quite
a
flutter
why
george
she
said
turning
to
her
nephew
how
does
it
happen
you
did
tell
us
and
with
both
hands
opening
as
if
to
express
her
innocence
of
some
conspiracy
she
exclaimed
to
the
others
he
never
said
one
word
to
us
about
lucy
planning
to
go
away
probably
afraid
to
the
major
suggested
did
know
but
he
might
break
down
and
cry
if
he
tried
to
speak
of
it
he
clapped
his
grandson
on
the
shoulder
inquiring
jocularly
that
it
georgie
georgie
made
no
reply
but
he
was
red
enough
to
justify
the
developing
a
chuckle
into
laughter
though
miss
fanny
observing
her
nephew
keenly
got
an
impression
that
this
fiery
blush
was
in
truth
more
fiery
than
tender
she
caught
a
glint
in
his
eye
less
like
confusion
than
resentment
and
saw
a
dilation
of
his
nostrils
which
might
have
indicated
not
so
much
a
sweet
agitation
as
an
inaudible
snort
fanny
had
never
been
lacking
in
curiosity
and
since
her
brother
death
this
quality
was
more
than
ever
alert
the
fact
that
george
had
spent
all
the
evenings
of
the
past
week
at
home
had
not
been
lost
upon
her
nor
had
she
failed
to
ascertain
by
diplomatic
inquiries
that
since
the
day
of
the
visit
to
eugene
shops
george
had
gone
driving
alone
at
the
she
continued
to
observe
him
sidelong
and
toward
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
she
was
not
startled
by
an
episode
which
brought
discomfort
to
the
others
after
the
arrival
of
coffee
the
major
was
rallying
eugene
upon
some
rival
automobile
shops
lately
built
in
a
suburb
and
already
promising
to
flourish
i
suppose
they
either
drive
you
out
of
the
business
said
the
old
gentleman
or
else
the
two
of
you
drive
all
the
rest
of
us
off
the
if
we
do
we
even
things
up
by
making
the
streets
five
or
ten
times
as
long
as
they
are
now
eugene
returned
how
do
you
propose
to
do
that
it
is
the
distance
from
the
center
of
a
town
that
counts
said
eugene
it
the
time
it
takes
to
get
there
this
town
already
spreading
bicycles
and
trolleys
have
been
doing
their
share
but
the
automobile
is
going
to
carry
city
streets
clear
out
to
the
county
the
major
was
skeptical
dream
on
fair
son
he
said
it
lucky
for
us
that
you
only
dreaming
because
if
people
go
to
moving
that
far
real
estate
values
in
the
old
residence
part
of
town
are
going
to
be
stretched
pretty
i
afraid
so
eugene
assented
unless
you
keep
things
so
bright
and
clean
that
the
old
section
will
stay
more
attractive
than
the
new
not
very
likely
how
are
things
going
to
be
kept
and
with
soft
coal
and
our
kind
of
city
government
they
are
eugene
replied
quickly
there
no
hope
of
it
and
already
the
is
marching
up
national
avenue
there
are
two
in
the
next
block
below
here
and
there
are
a
dozen
in
the
below
that
my
relatives
the
sharons
have
sold
their
house
and
are
building
in
the
country
at
least
they
call
it
country
it
will
be
city
in
two
or
three
good
gracious
the
major
exclaimed
affecting
so
your
little
shops
are
going
to
ruin
all
your
old
friends
eugene
unless
my
old
friends
take
warning
in
time
or
abolish
smoke
and
get
a
new
kind
of
city
government
i
should
say
the
best
chance
is
to
take
well
well
the
major
laughed
you
have
enough
faith
in
miracles
eugene
granting
that
trolleys
and
bicycles
and
automobiles
are
miracles
so
you
think
they
to
change
the
face
of
the
land
do
you
they
already
doing
it
major
and
it
ca
be
stopped
automobiles
at
this
point
he
was
interrupted
george
was
the
interrupter
he
had
said
nothing
since
entering
the
dining
room
but
now
he
spoke
in
a
loud
and
peremptory
voice
using
the
tone
of
one
in
authority
who
checks
idle
prattle
and
settles
a
matter
forever
automobiles
are
a
useless
nuisance
he
said
there
fell
a
moment
silence
isabel
gazed
incredulously
at
george
colour
slowly
heightening
upon
her
cheeks
and
temples
while
fanny
watched
him
with
a
quick
eagerness
her
eyes
alert
and
bright
but
eugene
seemed
merely
quizzical
as
if
not
taking
this
brusquerie
to
himself
the
major
was
seriously
disturbed
what
did
you
say
george
he
asked
though
george
had
spoken
but
too
distinctly
i
said
all
automobiles
were
a
nuisance
george
answered
repeating
not
only
the
words
but
the
tone
in
which
he
had
uttered
them
and
he
added
they
never
amount
to
anything
but
a
nuisance
they
had
no
business
to
be
the
major
frowned
of
course
you
forget
that
morgan
makes
them
and
also
did
his
share
in
inventing
them
if
you
were
so
thoughtless
he
might
think
you
rather
that
would
be
too
bad
said
george
coolly
i
do
think
i
could
survive
again
there
was
a
silence
while
the
major
stared
at
his
grandson
aghast
but
eugene
began
to
laugh
cheerfully
i
not
sure
he
wrong
about
automobiles
he
said
with
all
their
speed
forward
they
may
be
a
step
backward
in
civilization
that
is
in
spiritual
civilization
it
may
be
that
they
will
not
add
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
nor
to
the
life
of
men
souls
i
am
not
sure
but
automobiles
have
come
and
they
bring
a
greater
change
in
our
life
than
most
of
us
suspect
they
are
here
and
almost
all
outward
things
are
going
to
be
different
because
of
what
they
bring
they
are
going
to
alter
war
and
they
are
going
to
alter
peace
i
think
men
minds
are
going
to
be
changed
in
subtle
ways
because
of
automobiles
just
how
though
i
could
hardly
guess
but
you
ca
have
the
immense
outward
changes
that
they
will
cause
without
some
inward
ones
and
it
may
be
that
george
is
right
and
that
the
spiritual
alteration
will
be
bad
for
us
perhaps
ten
or
twenty
years
from
now
if
we
can
see
the
inward
change
in
men
by
that
time
i
should
be
able
to
defend
the
gasoline
engine
but
would
have
to
agree
with
him
that
automobiles
no
business
to
be
invented
he
laughed
and
looking
at
his
watch
apologized
for
having
an
engagement
which
made
his
departure
necessary
when
he
would
so
much
prefer
to
linger
then
he
shook
hands
with
the
major
and
bade
isabel
george
and
fanny
a
cheerful
a
collective
farewell
cordially
addressed
to
all
three
of
them
together
and
left
them
at
the
table
isabel
turned
wondering
hurt
eyes
upon
her
son
george
dear
she
said
what
did
you
mean
just
what
i
said
he
returned
lighting
one
of
the
major
cigars
and
his
manner
was
imperturbable
enough
to
warrant
the
definition
sometimes
merited
by
imperturbability
of
stubbornness
isabel
hand
pale
and
slender
upon
the
tablecloth
touched
one
of
the
fine
silver
candlesticks
aimlessly
the
fingers
were
seen
to
tremble
oh
he
was
hurt
she
murmured
i
do
see
why
he
should
be
george
said
i
did
say
anything
about
him
he
did
seem
to
me
to
be
hurt
seemed
perfectly
cheerful
what
made
you
think
he
was
hurt
i
know
him
was
all
of
her
reply
half
whispered
the
major
stared
hard
at
george
from
under
his
white
eyebrows
you
did
mean
you
say
george
i
suppose
if
we
had
a
clergyman
as
a
guest
here
you
expect
him
not
to
be
offended
and
to
understand
that
your
remarks
were
neither
personal
nor
untactful
if
you
said
the
church
was
a
nuisance
and
ought
never
to
have
been
invented
by
jove
but
you
a
puzzle
in
what
way
may
i
ask
sir
we
seem
to
have
a
new
kind
of
young
people
these
days
the
old
gentleman
returned
shaking
his
head
it
a
new
style
of
courting
a
pretty
girl
certainly
for
a
young
fellow
to
go
deliberately
out
of
his
way
to
try
and
make
an
enemy
of
her
father
by
attacking
his
business
by
jove
that
a
new
way
to
win
a
woman
george
flushed
angrily
and
seemed
about
to
offer
a
retort
but
held
his
breath
for
a
moment
and
then
held
his
peace
it
was
isabel
who
responded
to
the
major
oh
no
she
said
eugene
would
never
be
anybody
enemy
he
could
and
last
of
all
georgie
i
afraid
he
was
hurt
but
i
do
fear
his
not
having
understood
that
george
spoke
without
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
i
mean
realizing
its
bearing
on
again
george
seemed
upon
the
point
of
speech
and
again
controlled
the
impulse
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
staring
inflexibly
at
the
ceiling
well
well
said
his
grandfather
rising
it
was
a
very
successful
little
dinner
thereupon
he
offered
his
arm
to
his
daughter
who
took
it
fondly
and
they
left
the
room
isabel
assuring
him
that
all
his
little
dinners
were
pleasant
and
that
this
one
was
no
exception
george
did
not
move
and
fanny
following
the
other
two
came
round
the
table
and
paused
close
beside
his
chair
but
george
remained
posed
in
his
great
imperturbability
cigar
between
teeth
eyes
upon
ceiling
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
fanny
waited
until
the
sound
of
isabel
and
the
major
voices
became
inaudible
in
the
hall
then
she
said
quickly
and
in
a
low
voice
so
eager
that
it
was
unsteady
george
you
struck
just
the
treatment
to
adopt
you
doing
the
right
thing
she
hurried
out
scurrying
after
the
others
with
a
faint
rustling
of
her
black
skirts
leaving
george
mystified
but
incurious
he
did
not
understand
why
she
should
bestow
her
approbation
upon
him
in
the
matter
and
cared
so
little
whether
she
did
or
not
that
he
spared
himself
even
the
trouble
of
being
puzzled
about
it
in
truth
however
he
was
neither
so
comfortable
nor
so
imperturbable
as
he
appeared
he
felt
some
gratification
he
had
done
a
little
to
put
the
man
in
his
place
that
man
whose
influence
upon
his
daughter
was
precisely
the
same
thing
as
a
contemptuous
criticism
of
george
amberson
minafer
and
of
george
amberson
minafer
ideals
of
lucy
going
away
without
a
word
was
intended
he
supposed
as
a
bit
of
punishment
well
he
was
the
sort
of
man
that
people
were
allowed
to
punish
he
could
demonstrate
that
to
them
since
they
started
it
it
appeared
to
him
as
almost
a
kind
of
insolence
this
abrupt
departure
not
even
telephoning
probably
she
wondered
how
he
would
take
it
she
even
might
have
supposed
he
would
show
some
betraying
chagrin
when
he
heard
of
it
he
had
no
idea
that
this
was
just
what
he
had
shown
and
he
was
satisfied
with
his
evening
performance
nevertheless
he
was
not
comfortable
in
his
mind
though
he
could
not
have
explained
his
inward
perturbations
for
he
was
convinced
without
any
confirmation
from
his
aunt
fanny
that
he
had
done
just
the
right
chapter
xx
isabel
came
to
george
door
that
night
and
when
she
had
kissed
him
she
remained
in
the
open
doorway
with
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
thoughtfully
lowered
so
that
her
wish
to
say
something
more
than
was
evident
not
less
obvious
was
her
perplexity
about
the
manner
of
saying
it
and
george
divining
her
thought
amiably
made
an
opening
for
her
well
old
lady
he
said
indulgently
you
need
look
so
worried
i
wo
be
tactless
with
morgan
again
after
this
i
just
keep
out
of
his
isabel
looked
up
searching
his
face
with
the
fond
puzzlement
which
her
eyes
sometimes
showed
when
they
rested
upon
him
then
she
glanced
down
the
hall
toward
fanny
room
and
after
another
moment
of
hesitation
came
quickly
in
and
closed
the
door
dear
she
said
i
wish
you
tell
me
something
why
do
you
like
eugene
oh
i
like
him
well
enough
george
returned
with
a
short
laugh
as
he
sat
down
and
began
to
unlace
his
shoes
i
like
him
well
enough
in
his
no
dear
she
said
hurriedly
i
had
a
feeling
from
the
very
first
that
you
did
really
like
him
that
you
really
never
liked
him
sometimes
you
seemed
to
be
friendly
with
him
and
you
laugh
with
him
over
something
in
a
jolly
companionable
way
and
i
think
i
was
wrong
and
that
you
really
did
like
him
after
all
but
sure
my
other
feeling
was
the
right
one
you
do
like
him
i
understand
it
dear
i
do
see
what
can
be
the
nothing
the
this
easy
declaration
naturally
failed
to
carry
great
weight
and
isabel
went
on
in
her
troubled
voice
it
seems
so
queer
especially
when
you
feel
as
you
do
about
his
at
this
george
stopped
unlacing
his
shoes
abruptly
and
sat
up
how
do
i
feel
about
his
daughter
he
demanded
well
it
seemed
as
if
as
if
isabel
began
timidly
it
did
seem
at
least
you
have
looked
at
any
other
girl
ever
since
they
came
here
and
and
certainly
you
seemed
very
much
interested
in
her
certainly
you
been
very
great
friends
well
what
of
that
it
only
that
i
like
your
grandfather
i
ca
see
how
you
could
be
so
much
interested
in
a
girl
and
and
not
feel
very
pleasantly
toward
her
well
i
tell
you
something
george
said
slowly
and
a
frown
of
concentration
could
be
seen
upon
his
brow
as
from
a
profound
effort
at
i
have
ever
thought
much
on
that
particular
point
but
i
admit
there
may
be
a
little
something
in
what
you
say
the
truth
is
i
do
believe
i
ever
thought
of
the
two
together
exactly
at
least
not
until
lately
i
always
thought
of
lucy
just
as
lucy
and
of
morgan
just
as
morgan
i
always
thought
of
her
as
a
person
herself
not
as
anybody
daughter
i
do
see
what
very
extraordinary
about
that
you
probably
got
plenty
of
friends
for
instance
that
do
care
much
about
your
son
no
indeed
she
protested
quickly
and
if
i
knew
anybody
who
felt
like
that
i
would
never
mind
he
interrupted
i
try
to
explain
a
little
more
if
i
have
a
friend
i
do
see
that
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
like
that
friend
relatives
if
i
did
like
them
and
pretended
to
i
be
a
hypocrite
if
that
friend
likes
me
and
wants
to
stay
my
friend
have
to
stand
my
not
liking
his
relatives
or
else
he
can
quit
i
decline
to
be
a
hypocrite
about
it
that
all
now
suppose
i
have
certain
ideas
or
ideals
which
i
have
chosen
for
the
regulation
of
my
own
conduct
in
life
suppose
some
friend
of
mine
has
a
relative
with
ideals
directly
the
opposite
of
mine
and
my
friend
believes
more
in
the
relative
ideals
than
in
mine
do
you
think
i
ought
to
give
up
my
own
just
to
please
a
person
who
taken
up
ideals
that
i
really
despise
no
dear
of
course
people
ca
give
up
their
ideals
but
i
do
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
dear
little
lucy
and
i
did
say
it
had
anything
to
do
with
them
he
interrupted
i
was
merely
putting
a
case
to
show
how
a
person
would
be
justified
in
being
a
friend
of
one
member
of
a
family
and
feeling
anything
but
friendly
toward
another
i
do
say
though
that
i
feel
unfriendly
to
morgan
i
do
say
that
i
feel
friendly
to
him
and
i
do
say
that
i
feel
unfriendly
but
if
you
really
think
that
i
was
rude
to
him
just
thoughtless
dear
you
did
see
that
what
you
said
well
i
not
say
anything
of
that
sort
again
where
he
can
hear
it
there
is
that
enough
this
question
delivered
with
large
indulgence
met
with
no
response
for
isabel
still
searching
his
face
with
her
troubled
and
perplexed
gaze
seemed
not
to
have
heard
it
on
that
account
george
repeated
it
and
rising
went
to
her
and
patted
her
reassuringly
upon
the
shoulder
there
old
lady
you
need
fear
my
tactlessness
will
worry
you
again
i
ca
quite
promise
to
like
people
i
do
care
about
one
way
or
another
but
you
can
be
sure
i
be
careful
after
this
not
to
let
them
see
it
it
all
right
and
you
better
toddle
along
to
bed
because
i
want
to
but
george
she
said
earnestly
you
would
like
him
if
you
just
let
yourself
you
say
you
do
dislike
him
why
do
you
like
him
i
ca
understand
at
all
what
is
it
that
you
do
there
there
he
said
it
all
right
and
you
toddle
but
george
dear
now
now
i
really
do
want
to
get
into
bed
old
dear
but
let
not
talk
of
it
any
more
he
said
it
all
right
and
nothing
in
the
world
to
worry
about
so
old
lady
i
be
polite
enough
to
him
never
fear
if
we
happen
to
be
thrown
together
so
but
george
dear
i
going
to
bed
old
lady
so
thus
the
interview
closed
perforce
she
kissed
him
again
before
going
slowly
to
her
own
room
her
perplexity
evidently
not
dispersed
but
the
subject
was
not
renewed
between
them
the
next
day
or
subsequently
nor
did
fanny
make
any
allusion
to
the
cryptic
approbation
she
had
bestowed
upon
her
nephew
after
the
major
not
very
successful
little
dinner
though
she
annoyed
george
by
looking
at
him
oftener
and
longer
than
he
cared
to
be
looked
at
by
an
aunt
he
could
not
glance
her
way
it
seemed
without
finding
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
eagerly
with
an
alert
and
hopeful
calculation
in
them
which
he
declared
would
send
a
nervous
man
into
fits
for
thus
one
day
he
broke
out
in
protest
it
would
he
repeated
vehemently
given
time
it
would
straight
into
fits
what
do
you
find
the
matter
with
me
is
my
tie
always
slipping
up
behind
ca
you
look
at
something
else
my
lord
we
better
buy
a
cat
for
you
to
stare
at
aunt
fanny
a
cat
could
stand
it
maybe
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
do
you
expect
to
see
but
fanny
laughed
and
was
not
offended
it
more
as
if
i
expected
you
to
see
something
is
it
she
said
quietly
still
laughing
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
never
mind
all
right
i
do
but
for
heaven
sake
stare
at
somebody
else
awhile
try
it
on
the
well
well
fanny
said
indulgently
and
then
chose
to
be
more
obscure
in
her
meaning
than
ever
for
she
adopted
a
tone
of
deep
sympathy
for
her
final
remark
as
she
left
him
i
do
wonder
you
nervous
these
days
poor
boy
and
george
indignantly
supposed
that
she
referred
to
the
ordeal
of
lucy
continued
absence
during
this
period
he
successfully
avoided
contact
with
lucy
father
though
eugene
came
frequently
to
the
house
and
spent
several
evenings
with
isabel
and
fanny
and
sometimes
persuaded
them
and
the
major
to
go
for
an
afternoon
motoring
he
did
not
however
come
again
to
the
major
sunday
evening
dinner
even
when
george
amberson
returned
sunday
evening
was
the
time
he
explained
for
going
over
the
week
work
with
his
factory
managers
when
lucy
came
home
the
autumn
was
far
enough
advanced
to
smell
of
burning
leaves
and
for
the
annual
editorials
in
the
papers
on
the
purple
haze
the
golden
branches
the
ruddy
fruit
and
the
pleasure
of
long
tramps
in
the
brown
forest
george
had
not
heard
of
her
arrival
and
he
met
her
on
the
afternoon
following
that
event
at
the
sharons
where
he
had
gone
in
the
secret
hope
that
he
might
hear
something
about
her
janie
sharon
had
just
begun
to
tell
him
that
she
heard
lucy
was
expected
home
soon
after
having
a
perfectly
gorgeous
time
information
which
george
received
with
no
responsive
enthusiasm
when
lucy
came
demurely
in
a
proper
little
autumn
figure
in
green
and
brown
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
dark
eyes
were
bright
indeed
evidences
as
george
supposed
of
the
excitement
incidental
to
the
perfectly
gorgeous
time
just
concluded
though
janie
and
mary
sharon
both
thought
they
were
the
effect
of
lucy
having
seen
runabout
in
front
of
the
house
as
she
came
in
george
took
on
colour
himself
as
he
rose
and
nodded
indifferently
and
the
hot
suffusion
to
which
he
became
subject
extended
its
area
to
include
his
neck
and
ears
nothing
could
have
made
him
much
more
indignant
than
his
consciousness
of
these
symptoms
of
the
icy
indifference
which
it
was
his
purpose
not
only
to
show
but
to
feel
she
kissed
her
cousins
gave
george
her
hand
said
how
do
and
took
a
chair
beside
janie
with
a
composure
which
augmented
indignation
how
do
he
said
i
trust
that
ah
i
trust
i
do
trust
he
stopped
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
word
trust
sounded
idiotic
then
to
cover
his
awkwardness
he
coughed
and
even
to
his
own
rosy
ears
his
cough
was
ostentatiously
a
false
one
whereupon
seeking
to
be
plausible
he
coughed
again
and
instantly
hated
himself
the
sound
he
made
was
an
atrocity
meanwhile
lucy
sat
silent
and
the
two
sharon
girls
leaned
forward
staring
at
him
with
strained
eyes
their
lips
tightly
compressed
and
both
were
but
too
easily
diagnosed
as
subject
to
an
agitation
which
threatened
their
he
began
again
i
er
i
hope
you
have
had
a
a
pleasant
time
i
er
i
hope
you
are
well
i
hope
you
are
extremely
i
hope
extremely
extremely
and
again
he
stopped
in
the
midst
of
his
floundering
not
knowing
how
to
progress
beyond
extremely
and
unable
to
understand
why
the
infernal
word
kept
getting
into
his
mouth
i
beg
your
pardon
lucy
said
george
was
never
more
furious
he
felt
that
he
was
making
a
spectacle
of
himself
and
no
young
gentleman
in
the
world
was
more
loath
than
george
amberson
minafer
to
look
a
figure
of
fun
and
while
he
stood
there
undeniably
such
a
figure
with
janie
and
mary
sharon
threatening
to
burst
at
any
moment
if
laughter
were
longer
denied
them
lucy
sat
looking
at
him
with
her
eyebrows
delicately
lifted
in
casual
polite
inquiry
her
own
complete
composure
was
what
most
galled
him
nothing
of
the
slightest
importance
he
managed
to
say
i
was
just
leaving
good
afternoon
and
with
long
strides
he
reached
the
door
and
hastened
through
the
hall
but
before
he
closed
the
front
door
he
heard
from
janie
and
mary
sharon
the
outburst
of
wild
irrepressible
emotion
which
his
performance
had
inspired
he
drove
home
in
a
tumultuous
mood
and
almost
ran
down
two
ladies
who
were
engaged
in
absorbing
conversation
at
a
crossing
they
were
his
aunt
fanny
and
the
stout
johnson
a
jerk
of
the
reins
at
the
last
instant
saved
them
by
a
few
inches
but
their
conversation
was
so
interesting
that
they
were
unaware
of
their
danger
and
did
not
notice
the
runabout
nor
how
close
it
came
to
them
george
was
so
furious
with
himself
and
with
the
girl
whose
unexpected
coming
into
a
room
could
make
him
look
such
a
fool
that
it
might
have
soothed
him
a
little
if
he
had
actually
run
over
the
two
absorbed
ladies
without
injuring
them
beyond
repair
at
least
he
said
to
himself
that
he
wished
he
had
it
might
have
taken
his
mind
off
of
himself
for
a
few
minutes
for
in
truth
to
be
ridiculous
and
know
it
was
one
of
several
things
that
george
was
unable
to
endure
he
was
savage
he
drove
into
the
major
stable
too
fast
the
sagacious
pendennis
saving
himself
from
going
through
a
partition
by
a
swerve
which
splintered
a
shaft
of
the
runabout
and
almost
threw
the
driver
to
the
floor
george
swore
and
then
swore
again
at
the
fat
old
darkey
tom
for
giggling
at
his
swearing
hoopee
said
old
tom

george
said
sternly
yessuh
george
strode
from
the
stable
crossed
the
major
back
yard
then
passed
behind
the
new
houses
on
his
way
home
these
structures
were
now
approaching
completion
but
still
in
a
state
of
rawness
hideous
to
george
though
for
that
matter
they
were
never
to
be
anything
except
hideous
to
him
behind
them
stray
planks
bricks
refuse
of
plaster
and
lath
shingles
straw
empty
barrels
strips
of
twisted
tin
and
broken
tiles
were
strewn
everywhere
over
the
dried
and
pitted
gray
mud
where
once
the
suave
lawn
had
lain
like
a
green
lake
around
those
stately
islands
the
two
amberson
houses
and
george
state
of
mind
was
not
improved
by
his
present
view
of
this
repulsive
area
nor
by
his
sensations
when
he
kicked
an
uptilted
shingle
only
to
discover
that
what
uptilted
it
was
a
brickbat
on
the
other
side
of
it
after
that
the
whole
world
seemed
to
be
one
solid
conspiracy
of
malevolence
in
this
temper
he
emerged
from
behind
the
house
nearest
to
his
own
and
glancing
toward
the
street
saw
his
mother
standing
with
eugene
morgan
upon
the
cement
path
that
led
to
the
front
gate
she
was
bareheaded
and
eugene
held
his
hat
and
stick
in
his
hand
evidently
he
had
been
calling
upon
her
and
she
had
come
from
the
house
with
him
continuing
their
conversation
and
delaying
their
parting
they
had
paused
in
their
slow
walk
from
the
front
door
to
the
gate
yet
still
stood
side
by
side
their
shoulders
almost
touching
as
though
neither
isabel
nor
eugene
quite
realized
that
their
feet
had
ceased
to
bear
them
forward
and
they
were
not
looking
at
each
other
but
at
some
indefinite
point
before
them
as
people
do
who
consider
together
thoughtfully
and
in
harmony
the
conversation
was
evidently
serious
his
head
was
bent
and
isabel
lifted
left
hand
rested
against
her
cheek
but
all
the
significances
of
their
thoughtful
attitude
denoted
companionableness
and
a
shared
understanding
yet
a
stranger
passing
would
not
have
thought
them
married
somewhere
about
eugene
not
quite
to
be
located
there
was
a
romantic
gravity
and
isabel
tall
and
graceful
with
high
colour
and
absorbed
eyes
was
visibly
no
wife
walking
down
to
the
gate
with
her
husband
george
stared
at
them
a
hot
dislike
struck
him
at
the
sight
of
eugene
and
a
vague
revulsion
like
a
strange
unpleasant
taste
in
his
mouth
came
over
him
as
he
looked
at
his
mother
her
manner
was
eloquent
of
so
much
thought
about
her
companion
and
of
such
reliance
upon
him
and
the
picture
the
two
thus
made
was
a
vivid
one
indeed
to
george
whose
angry
eyes
for
some
reason
fixed
themselves
most
intently
upon
lifted
hand
upon
the
white
ruffle
at
her
wrist
bordering
the
graceful
black
sleeve
and
upon
the
little
indentations
in
her
cheek
where
the
tips
of
her
fingers
rested
she
should
not
have
worn
white
at
her
wrist
or
at
the
throat
either
george
felt
and
then
strangely
his
resentment
concentrated
upon
those
tiny
indentations
at
the
tips
of
her
fingers
actual
changes
however
slight
and
fleeting
in
his
face
made
because
of
eugene
morgan
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
george
that
morgan
might
have
claimed
the
ownership
of
a
face
that
changed
for
it
was
as
if
he
owned
isabel
the
two
began
to
walk
on
toward
the
gate
where
they
stopped
again
turning
to
face
each
other
and
isabel
glance
passing
eugene
fell
upon
george
instantly
she
smiled
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
while
eugene
turned
and
nodded
but
george
standing
as
in
some
rigid
trance
and
staring
straight
at
them
gave
these
signals
of
greeting
no
sign
of
recognition
whatever
upon
this
isabel
called
to
him
waving
her
hand
again
georgie
she
called
laughing
wake
up
dear
georgie
hello
george
turned
away
as
if
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
and
stalked
into
the
house
by
the
side
door
chapter
xxi
he
went
to
his
room
threw
off
his
coat
waistcoat
collar
and
tie
letting
them
lie
where
they
chanced
to
fall
and
then
having
violently
enveloped
himself
in
a
black
velvet
continued
this
action
by
lying
down
with
a
vehemence
that
brought
a
wheeze
of
protest
from
his
bed
his
repose
was
only
a
momentary
semblance
however
for
it
lasted
no
longer
than
the
time
it
took
him
to
groan
riffraff
between
his
teeth
then
he
sat
up
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
rose
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
large
room
he
had
just
been
consciously
rude
to
his
mother
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
for
with
all
his
riding
down
of
populace
and
riffraff
he
had
never
before
been
either
deliberately
or
impulsively
disregardful
of
her
when
he
had
hurt
her
it
had
been
accidental
and
his
remorse
for
such
an
accident
was
always
adequate
compensation
and
more
to
isabel
but
now
he
had
done
a
rough
thing
to
her
and
he
did
not
repent
rather
he
was
the
more
irritated
with
her
and
when
he
heard
her
presently
go
by
his
door
with
a
light
step
singing
cheerfully
to
herself
as
she
went
to
her
room
he
perceived
that
she
had
mistaken
his
intention
altogether
or
indeed
had
failed
to
perceive
that
he
had
any
intention
at
all
evidently
she
had
concluded
that
he
refused
to
speak
to
her
and
morgan
out
of
sheer
supposing
him
so
immersed
in
some
preoccupation
that
he
had
not
seen
them
or
heard
her
calling
to
him
therefore
there
was
nothing
of
which
to
repent
even
if
he
had
been
so
minded
and
probably
eugene
himself
was
unaware
that
any
disapproval
had
recently
been
expressed
george
snorted
what
sort
of
a
dreamy
loon
did
they
take
him
to
be
there
came
a
delicate
eager
tapping
at
his
door
not
done
with
a
knuckle
but
with
the
tip
of
a
fingernail
which
was
instantly
clarified
to
george
mind
eye
as
plainly
as
if
he
saw
it
the
long
and
polished
pink
shield
on
the
end
of
his
aunt
fanny
right
forefinger
but
george
was
in
no
mood
for
human
communications
and
even
when
things
went
well
he
had
little
pleasure
in
fanny
society
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
at
the
sound
of
her
tapping
instead
of
bidding
her
enter
he
immediately
crossed
the
room
with
the
intention
of
locking
the
door
to
keep
her
out
fanny
was
too
eager
and
opening
the
door
before
he
reached
it
came
quickly
in
and
closed
it
behind
her
she
was
in
a
street
dress
and
a
black
hat
with
a
black
umbrella
in
her
hand
for
heavy
mourning
at
least
was
nowhere
tempered
with
a
glimpse
of
white
though
the
anniversary
of
wilbur
death
had
passed
an
infinitesimal
perspiration
gleamed
upon
her
pale
skin
she
breathed
fast
as
if
she
had
run
up
the
stairs
and
excitement
was
sharp
in
her
widened
eyes
her
look
was
that
of
a
person
who
had
just
seen
something
extraordinary
or
heard
thrilling
news
now
what
on
earth
do
you
want
her
chilling
nephew
demanded
george
she
said
hurriedly
i
saw
what
you
did
when
you
speak
to
them
i
was
sitting
with
johnson
at
her
front
window
across
the
street
and
i
saw
it
well
what
of
it
you
did
right
fanny
said
with
a
vehemence
not
the
less
spirited
because
she
suppressed
her
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
you
did
exactly
right
you
behaving
splendidly
about
the
whole
thing
and
i
want
to
tell
you
i
know
your
father
would
thank
you
if
he
could
see
what
my
lord
george
broke
out
at
her
you
make
me
dizzy
for
sake
quit
the
mysterious
detective
business
at
least
do
quit
it
around
me
go
and
try
it
on
somebody
else
if
you
like
but
i
do
want
to
hear
it
she
began
to
tremble
regarding
him
with
a
fixed
gaze
you
do
care
to
hear
then
she
said
huskily
that
i
approve
of
what
you
doing
certainly
not
since
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
you
think
naturally
i
do
care
whether
you
approve
of
it
or
not
all
i
like
if
you
please
is
to
be
alone
i
not
giving
a
tea
here
this
afternoon
if
you
permit
me
to
mention
it
fanny
gaze
wavered
she
began
to
blink
then
suddenly
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
wept
silently
but
with
a
terrible
desolation
oh
for
the
lord
sake
he
moaned
what
in
the
world
is
wrong
with
you
you
always
picking
on
me
she
quavered
wretchedly
her
voice
indistinct
with
the
wetness
that
bubbled
into
it
from
her
tears
you
do
you
always
pick
on
me
you
always
done
it
always
ever
since
you
were
a
little
boy
whenever
anything
goes
wrong
with
you
you
take
it
out
on
me
you
do
you
always
george
flung
to
heaven
a
gesture
of
despair
it
seemed
to
him
the
last
straw
that
fanny
should
have
chosen
this
particular
time
to
come
and
sob
in
his
room
over
his
mistreatment
of
her
oh
my
lord
he
whispered
then
with
a
great
effort
addressed
her
in
a
reasonable
tone
look
here
aunt
fanny
i
do
see
what
making
all
this
fuss
about
of
course
i
know
i
teased
you
sometimes
but
teased
me
she
wailed
teased
me
oh
it
does
seem
too
hard
sometimes
this
mean
old
life
of
mine
does
seem
too
hard
i
do
think
i
can
stand
it
honestly
i
do
think
i
can
i
came
in
here
just
to
show
you
i
sympathized
with
you
just
to
say
something
pleasant
to
you
and
you
treat
me
as
if
i
were
oh
no
you
would
treat
a
servant
the
way
you
treat
me
you
would
treat
anybody
in
the
world
like
this
except
old
fanny
fanny
you
say
nobody
but
old
fanny
so
i
kick
her
nobody
will
resent
it
i
kick
her
all
i
want
to
you
do
that
how
you
think
of
know
it
and
right
i
have
got
anything
in
the
world
since
my
brother
died
nobody
nothing
nothing
oh
my
lord
george
groaned
fanny
spread
out
her
small
soaked
handkerchief
and
shook
it
in
the
air
to
dry
it
a
little
crying
as
damply
and
as
wretchedly
during
this
operation
as
before
a
sight
which
gave
george
a
curious
shock
to
add
to
his
other
agitations
it
seemed
so
strange
i
ought
not
to
have
come
she
went
on
because
i
might
have
known
it
would
only
give
you
an
excuse
to
pick
on
me
again
i
sorry
enough
i
came
i
can
tell
you
i
did
mean
to
speak
of
it
again
to
you
at
all
and
i
would
have
but
i
saw
how
you
treated
them
and
i
guess
i
got
excited
about
it
and
could
help
following
the
impulse
but
i
know
better
next
time
i
can
tell
you
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
as
i
meant
to
and
as
i
would
have
if
i
had
got
excited
and
if
i
had
felt
sorry
for
you
but
what
does
it
matter
to
anybody
if
i
sorry
for
them
i
only
old
fanny
oh
good
gracious
how
can
it
matter
to
me
who
sorry
for
me
when
i
do
know
what
they
sorry
about
you
so
proud
she
quavered
and
so
hard
i
tell
you
i
did
mean
to
speak
of
it
to
you
and
i
never
never
in
the
world
would
have
told
you
about
it
nor
have
made
the
faintest
reference
to
it
if
i
seen
that
somebody
else
had
told
you
or
you
found
out
for
yourself
some
way
i
in
despair
of
her
intelligence
and
in
some
doubt
of
his
own
george
struck
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
somebody
else
had
told
me
what
i
found
what
out
for
myself
how
people
are
talking
about
your
except
for
the
incidental
teariness
of
her
voice
her
tone
was
casual
as
though
she
mentioned
a
subject
previously
discussed
and
understood
for
fanny
had
no
doubt
that
george
had
only
pretended
to
be
mystified
because
in
his
pride
he
would
not
in
words
admit
that
he
knew
what
he
knew
what
did
you
say
he
asked
incredulously
of
course
i
understood
what
you
were
doing
fanny
went
on
drying
her
handkerchief
again
it
puzzled
other
people
when
you
began
to
be
rude
to
eugene
because
they
could
see
how
you
could
treat
him
as
you
did
when
you
were
so
interested
in
lucy
but
i
remembered
how
you
came
to
me
that
other
time
when
there
was
so
much
talk
about
isabel
and
i
knew
you
give
lucy
up
in
a
minute
if
it
came
to
a
question
of
your
mother
reputation
because
you
said
then
that
look
here
george
interrupted
in
a
shaking
voice
look
here
like
he
stopped
unable
to
go
on
his
agitation
was
so
great
his
chest
heaved
as
from
hard
running
and
his
complexion
pallid
at
first
had
become
mottled
fiery
splotches
appearing
at
his
temples
and
cheeks
what
do
you
mean
by
telling
me
telling
me
there
talk
about
about
he
gulped
and
began
again
what
do
you
mean
by
using
such
words
as
what
do
you
mean
speaking
of
a
of
my
my
mother
reputation
fanny
looked
up
at
him
woefully
over
the
handkerchief
which
she
now
applied
to
her
reddened
nose
god
knows
i
sorry
for
you
george
she
murmured
i
wanted
to
say
so
but
it
only
old
fanny
so
whatever
she
says
even
when
it
sympathy
pick
on
her
for
it
hammer
her
she
sobbed
hammer
her
it
only
poor
old
lonely
fanny
you
look
here
george
said
harshly
when
i
spoke
to
my
uncle
george
after
that
rotten
thing
i
heard
aunt
amelia
say
about
my
mother
he
said
if
there
was
any
gossip
it
was
about
you
he
said
people
might
be
laughing
about
the
way
you
ran
after
morgan
but
that
was
fanny
lifted
her
hands
clenched
them
and
struck
them
upon
her
knees
yes
it
always
fanny
she
sobbed
ridiculous
old
fanny
always
always
you
listen
george
said
after
i
talked
to
uncle
george
i
saw
you
and
you
said
i
had
a
mean
little
mind
for
thinking
there
might
be
truth
in
what
aunt
amelia
said
about
people
talking
you
denied
it
and
that
was
the
only
time
you
attacked
me
before
then
because
i
intimated
that
morgan
might
be
coming
here
too
often
you
made
me
believe
that
mother
let
him
come
entirely
on
your
account
and
now
you
say
i
think
he
did
fanny
interrupted
desolately
i
think
he
did
come
as
much
to
see
me
as
anything
for
a
while
it
looked
like
it
anyhow
he
liked
to
dance
with
me
he
danced
with
me
as
much
as
he
danced
with
her
and
he
acted
as
if
he
came
on
my
account
at
least
as
much
as
he
did
on
hers
he
did
act
a
good
deal
that
way
and
if
wilbur
had
died
you
told
me
there
was
any
i
did
think
there
was
much
then
fanny
protested
i
did
know
how
much
there
what
people
do
come
and
tell
such
things
to
a
person
family
you
know
you
do
suppose
anybody
was
going
to
say
to
george
amberson
that
his
sister
was
getting
herself
talked
about
do
you
or
that
they
were
going
to
say
much
to
me
you
told
me
said
george
fiercely
that
mother
never
saw
him
except
when
she
was
chaperoning
they
were
much
alone
together
then
fanny
returned
hardly
ever
before
wilbur
died
but
you
do
suppose
that
stops
people
from
talking
do
you
your
father
never
went
anywhere
and
people
saw
eugene
with
her
everywhere
she
went
and
though
i
was
with
them
people
just
thought
she
choked
they
just
thought
i
did
count
old
fanny
minafer
i
suppose
they
say
besides
everybody
knew
that
he
been
engaged
to
her
what
that
george
cried
everybody
knows
it
do
you
remember
your
grandfather
speaking
of
it
at
the
sunday
dinner
one
night
he
did
say
they
were
engaged
or
well
they
were
everybody
knows
it
and
she
broke
it
off
on
account
of
that
serenade
when
eugene
did
know
what
he
was
doing
he
drank
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
she
would
stand
it
but
everybody
in
this
town
knows
that
isabel
has
never
really
cared
for
any
other
man
in
her
life
poor
wilbur
he
was
the
only
soul
alive
that
did
know
it
nightmare
had
descended
upon
the
unfortunate
george
he
leaned
back
against
the
of
his
bed
gazing
wildly
at
his
aunt
i
believe
i
going
crazy
he
said
you
mean
when
you
told
me
there
was
any
talk
you
told
me
a
falsehood
no
fanny
gasped
you
did
i
tell
you
i
did
know
how
much
talk
there
was
and
it
would
have
amounted
to
much
if
wilbur
had
and
fanny
completed
this
with
a
fatal
admission
i
did
want
you
to
george
overlooked
the
admission
his
mind
was
not
now
occupied
with
analysis
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
when
you
say
that
if
father
had
lived
the
talk
would
have
amounted
to
anything
things
might
have
been
they
might
have
been
you
mean
morgan
might
have
married
you
fanny
gulped
no
because
i
do
know
that
i
have
accepted
she
had
ceased
to
weep
and
now
she
sat
up
stiffly
i
certainly
did
care
enough
about
him
to
marry
him
i
would
have
let
myself
care
that
much
until
he
showed
that
he
wished
to
marry
me
i
not
that
sort
of
person
the
poor
lady
paid
her
vanity
this
piteous
little
tribute
what
i
mean
is
if
wilbur
had
died
people
would
have
had
it
proved
before
their
very
eyes
that
what
they
been
talking
about
was
true
you
say
you
say
that
people
believe
george
shuddered
then
forced
himself
to
continue
in
a
sick
voice
they
believe
my
mother
is
is
in
love
with
that
man
of
course
and
because
he
comes
here
and
they
see
her
with
him
driving
and
all
that
they
think
they
were
right
when
they
said
she
was
in
in
love
with
him
before
before
my
father
died
she
looked
at
him
gravely
with
her
eyes
now
dry
between
their
reddened
lids
why
george
she
said
gently
do
you
know
that
what
they
say
you
must
know
that
everybody
in
town
thinks
they
going
to
be
married
very
george
uttered
an
incoherent
cry
and
sections
of
him
appeared
to
writhe
he
was
upon
the
verge
of
actual
nausea
you
know
it
fanny
cried
getting
up
you
do
think
i
have
spoken
of
it
to
you
unless
i
was
sure
you
knew
it
her
voice
was
wholly
genuine
as
it
had
been
throughout
the
wretched
interview
sincerity
was
unquestionable
george
i
would
have
told
you
if
you
did
know
what
other
reason
could
you
have
for
treating
eugene
as
you
did
or
for
refusing
to
speak
to
them
like
that
a
while
ago
in
the
yard
somebody
must
have
told
you
who
told
you
he
said
what
who
told
you
there
was
talk
where
is
this
talk
where
does
it
come
from
who
does
it
why
i
suppose
pretty
much
everybody
she
said
i
know
it
must
be
pretty
who
said
so
what
george
stepped
close
to
her
you
say
people
do
speak
to
a
person
of
gossip
about
that
person
family
well
how
did
you
hear
it
then
how
did
you
get
hold
of
it
answer
me
fanny
looked
thoughtful
well
of
course
nobody
not
one
most
intimate
friends
would
speak
to
them
about
such
things
and
then
only
in
the
kindest
most
considerate
who
spoken
of
it
to
you
in
any
way
at
all
george
demanded
why
fanny
hesitated
you
answer
me
i
hardly
think
it
would
be
fair
to
give
look
here
said
george
one
of
your
most
intimate
friends
is
that
mother
of
charlie
johnson
for
instance
has
she
ever
mentioned
this
to
you
you
say
everybody
is
talking
is
she
one
oh
she
may
have
intimated
i
asking
you
has
she
ever
spoken
of
it
to
you
she
a
very
kind
discreet
woman
george
but
she
may
have
intimated
george
had
a
sudden
intuition
as
there
flickered
into
his
mind
the
picture
of
a
and
two
absorbed
ladies
almost
run
down
by
a
fast
horse
you
and
she
have
been
talking
about
it
he
cried
you
were
talking
about
it
with
her
not
two
hours
ago
do
you
deny
it
i
do
you
deny
it
no
all
right
said
george
that
enough
she
caught
at
his
arm
as
he
turned
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
george
i
not
talk
about
it
now
he
said
heavily
i
think
you
done
a
good
deal
for
one
day
aunt
fanny
and
fanny
seeing
the
passion
in
his
face
began
to
be
alarmed
she
tried
to
retain
possession
of
the
black
velvet
sleeve
which
her
fingers
had
clutched
and
he
suffered
her
to
do
so
but
used
this
leverage
to
urge
her
to
the
door
george
you
know
i
sorry
for
you
whether
you
care
or
not
she
whimpered
i
never
in
the
world
would
have
spoken
of
it
if
i
had
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
i
would
have
but
he
had
opened
the
door
with
his
free
hand
never
mind
he
said
and
she
was
obliged
to
pass
out
into
the
hall
the
door
closing
quickly
behind
her
chapter
xxii
george
took
off
his
and
put
on
a
collar
and
a
tie
his
fingers
shaking
so
that
the
tie
was
not
his
usual
success
then
he
picked
up
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
left
the
room
while
still
in
process
of
donning
them
fastening
the
buttons
as
he
ran
down
the
front
stairs
to
the
door
it
was
not
until
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
street
that
he
realized
that
he
had
forgotten
his
hat
and
he
paused
for
an
irresolute
moment
during
which
his
eye
wandered
for
no
reason
to
the
fountain
of
neptune
this
castiron
replica
of
too
elaborate
sculpture
stood
at
the
next
corner
where
the
major
had
placed
it
when
the
addition
was
laid
out
so
long
ago
the
street
corners
had
been
shaped
to
conform
with
the
great
octagonal
basin
which
was
no
great
inconvenience
for
vehicles
but
a
nuisance
to
speeding
automobiles
and
even
as
george
looked
one
of
the
latter
coming
too
fast
saved
itself
only
by
a
dangerous
skid
as
it
rounded
the
fountain
this
skid
was
to
george
liking
though
he
would
have
been
more
pleased
to
see
the
car
go
over
for
he
was
wishing
grief
and
destruction
just
then
upon
all
the
automobiles
in
the
world
his
eyes
rested
a
second
or
two
longer
upon
the
fountain
of
neptune
not
an
enlivening
sight
even
in
the
shielding
haze
of
autumn
twilight
for
more
than
a
year
no
water
had
run
in
the
fountain
the
connections
had
been
broken
and
the
major
was
evasive
about
restorations
even
when
reminded
by
his
grandson
that
a
dry
fountain
is
as
gay
as
a
dry
fish
soot
streaks
and
a
thousand
pits
gave
neptune
the
distinction
at
least
of
leprosy
which
the
mermaids
associated
with
him
had
been
consistent
in
catching
and
his
trident
had
been
so
deeply
affected
as
to
drop
its
prongs
altogether
this
heavy
work
of
heavy
art
smoked
dry
hugely
scabbed
cracked
and
crumbling
was
a
dismal
sight
to
the
distracted
eye
of
george
amberson
minafer
and
its
present
condition
of
craziness
may
have
added
a
mite
to
his
own
his
own
was
sufficient
with
no
additions
however
as
he
stood
looking
at
the
johnsons
house
and
those
houses
on
both
sides
of
it
that
row
of
riffraff
dwellings
he
had
thought
so
damnable
the
day
when
he
stood
in
his
grandfather
yard
staring
at
them
after
hearing
what
his
aunt
amelia
said
of
the
talk
about
his
mother
he
decided
that
he
needed
no
hat
for
the
sort
of
call
he
intended
to
make
and
went
forward
hurriedly
johnson
was
at
home
the
irish
girl
who
came
to
the
door
informed
him
and
he
was
left
to
await
the
lady
in
a
room
like
an
elegant
well
the
johnsons
reception
room
floor
space
nothing
to
mention
walls
blue
calcimined
ceiling
twelve
feet
from
the
floor
inside
shutters
and
gray
lace
curtains
five
gilt
chairs
a
brocaded
sofa
soiled
and
an
inlaid
walnut
table
supporting
two
tall
alabaster
vases
a
palm
with
two
leaves
dying
in
a
corner
johnson
came
in
breathing
noticeably
and
her
round
head
smoothly
but
economically
decorated
with
the
hair
of
an
honest
woman
seemed
to
be
lingering
far
in
the
background
of
the
alpine
bosom
which
took
precedence
of
the
rest
of
her
everywhere
but
when
she
was
all
in
the
room
it
was
to
be
seen
that
her
breathing
was
the
result
of
hospitable
haste
to
greet
the
visitor
and
her
hand
not
so
dry
as
fountain
suggested
that
she
had
paused
for
only
the
briefest
ablutions
george
accepted
this
cold
damp
lump
mechanically
mr
amberson
i
mean
minafer
she
exclaimed
i
really
delighted
i
understood
you
asked
for
me
johnson
out
of
the
city
but
charlie
downtown
and
i
looking
for
him
at
any
minute
now
and
he
be
so
pleased
that
you
i
did
want
to
see
charlie
george
said
i
want
do
sit
down
the
hospitable
lady
urged
him
seating
herself
upon
the
sofa
do
sit
no
i
thank
you
i
wish
surely
you
not
going
to
run
away
again
when
you
just
come
do
sit
down
minafer
i
hope
you
all
well
at
your
house
and
at
the
dear
old
major
too
he
looking
mrs
johnson
george
said
in
a
strained
loud
voice
which
arrested
her
attention
immediately
so
that
she
was
abruptly
silent
leaving
her
surprised
mouth
open
she
had
already
been
concealing
some
astonishment
at
this
unexampled
visit
however
and
the
condition
of
ordinarily
smooth
hair
for
he
had
overlooked
more
than
his
hat
had
not
alleviated
her
perplexity
mrs
johnson
he
said
i
have
come
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
which
i
would
like
you
to
answer
if
you
she
became
grave
at
once
certainly
minafer
anything
i
can
he
interrupted
sternly
yet
his
voice
shook
in
spite
of
its
sternness
you
were
talking
with
my
aunt
fanny
about
my
mother
this
at
this
johnson
uttered
an
involuntary
gasp
but
she
recovered
herself
then
i
sure
our
conversation
was
a
very
pleasant
one
if
we
were
talking
of
your
mother
because
again
he
interrupted
my
aunt
has
told
me
what
the
conversation
virtually
was
and
i
do
mean
to
waste
any
time
johnson
you
were
talking
about
a
george
shoulders
suddenly
heaved
uncontrollably
but
he
went
fiercely
on
you
were
discussing
a
scandal
that
involved
my
mother
mr
minafer
is
that
the
truth
i
do
feel
called
upon
to
answer
minafer
she
said
with
visible
agitation
i
do
not
consider
that
you
have
any
right
my
aunt
told
me
you
repeated
this
scandal
to
i
do
think
your
aunt
can
have
said
that
johnson
returned
sharply
i
did
not
repeat
a
scandal
of
any
kind
to
your
aunt
and
i
think
you
are
mistaken
in
saying
she
told
you
i
did
we
may
have
discussed
some
matters
that
have
been
a
topic
of
comment
about
town
yes
george
cried
i
think
you
may
have
that
what
i
here
about
and
what
i
intend
to
do
tell
me
what
you
intend
please
johnson
interrupted
crisply
and
i
should
prefer
that
you
would
not
make
your
voice
quite
so
loud
in
this
house
which
i
happen
to
own
your
aunt
may
have
told
you
though
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
unwise
in
her
if
she
did
and
not
very
considerate
of
me
she
may
have
told
you
that
we
discussed
some
such
topic
as
i
have
mentioned
and
possibly
that
would
have
been
true
if
i
talked
it
over
with
her
you
may
be
sure
i
spoke
in
the
most
charitable
spirit
and
without
sharing
in
other
people
disposition
to
put
an
evil
interpretation
on
what
may
be
nothing
more
than
unfortunate
appearances
and
my
god
said
george
i
ca
stand
this
you
have
the
option
of
dropping
the
subject
johnson
suggested
tartly
and
she
added
or
of
leaving
the
i
do
that
soon
enough
but
first
i
mean
to
know
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
tell
you
anything
you
wish
if
you
will
remember
to
ask
it
quietly
i
also
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
you
that
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
discuss
the
subject
with
your
aunt
other
people
may
be
less
considerate
in
not
confining
their
discussion
of
it
as
i
have
to
charitable
views
expressed
only
to
a
member
of
the
family
other
people
other
people
the
unhappy
george
repeated
viciously
that
what
i
want
to
know
about
these
other
people
i
beg
your
i
want
to
ask
you
about
them
you
say
you
know
of
other
people
who
talk
about
i
presume
they
how
many
what
i
want
to
know
how
many
other
people
talk
about
it
dear
dear
she
protested
how
should
i
know
that
have
you
heard
anybody
mention
it
i
presume
well
how
many
have
you
heard
johnson
was
becoming
more
annoyed
than
apprehensive
and
she
showed
it
really
this
is
a
she
said
and
i
not
a
defendant
in
a
either
the
unfortunate
young
man
lost
what
remained
of
his
balance
you
may
be
he
cried
i
intend
to
know
just
who
dared
to
say
these
things
if
i
have
to
force
my
way
into
every
house
in
town
and
i
going
to
make
them
take
every
word
of
it
back
i
mean
to
know
the
name
of
every
slanderer
that
spoken
of
this
matter
to
you
and
of
every
tattler
you
passed
it
on
to
yourself
i
mean
to
know
you
know
something
pretty
quick
she
said
rising
with
difficulty
and
her
voice
was
thick
with
the
sense
of
insult
you
know
that
you
out
in
the
street
please
to
leave
my
house
george
stiffened
sharply
then
he
bowed
and
strode
out
of
the
door
three
minutes
later
disheveled
and
perspiring
but
cold
all
over
he
burst
into
his
uncle
george
room
at
the
major
without
knocking
amberson
was
dressing
good
gracious
georgie
he
exclaimed
what
up
i
just
come
from
johnson
across
the
street
george
panted
you
have
your
own
tastes
was
amberson
comment
but
curious
as
they
are
you
ought
to
do
something
better
with
your
hair
and
button
your
waistcoat
to
the
right
buttons
even
for
johnson
what
were
you
doing
over
there
she
told
me
to
leave
the
house
george
said
desperately
i
went
there
because
aunt
fanny
told
me
the
whole
town
was
talking
about
my
mother
and
that
man
morgan
that
they
say
my
mother
is
going
to
marry
him
and
that
proves
she
was
too
fond
of
him
before
my
father
died
she
said
this
johnson
was
one
that
talked
about
it
and
i
went
to
her
to
ask
who
were
the
amberson
jaw
fell
in
dismay
do
tell
me
you
did
that
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
then
seeing
that
it
was
true
oh
now
you
have
done
it
chapter
xxiii
i
it
george
cried
what
do
you
mean
i
done
it
and
what
have
i
done
amberson
had
collapsed
into
an
easy
chair
beside
his
the
white
evening
tie
he
had
been
about
to
put
on
dangling
from
his
hand
which
had
fallen
limply
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
the
tie
dropped
to
the
floor
before
he
replied
and
the
hand
that
had
held
it
was
lifted
to
stroke
his
graying
hair
reflectively
by
jove
he
muttered
that
is
too
bad
george
folded
his
arms
bitterly
will
you
kindly
answer
my
question
what
have
i
done
that
was
honourable
and
right
do
you
think
these
riffraff
can
go
about
bandying
my
mother
name
they
can
now
said
amberson
i
do
know
if
they
could
before
but
they
certainly
can
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
his
uncle
sighed
profoundly
picked
up
his
tie
and
preoccupied
with
despondency
twisted
the
strip
of
white
lawn
till
it
became
unwearable
meanwhile
he
tried
to
enlighten
his
nephew
gossip
is
never
fatal
georgie
he
said
until
it
is
denied
gossip
goes
on
about
every
human
being
alive
and
about
all
the
dead
that
are
alive
enough
to
be
remembered
and
yet
almost
never
does
any
harm
until
some
defender
makes
a
controversy
gossip
a
nasty
thing
but
it
sickly
and
if
people
of
good
intentions
will
let
it
entirely
alone
it
will
die
times
out
of
a
see
here
george
said
i
did
come
to
listen
to
any
generalizing
dose
of
philosophy
i
ask
you
you
asked
me
what
you
done
and
i
telling
amberson
gave
him
a
melancholy
smile
continuing
suffer
me
to
do
it
in
my
own
way
fanny
says
there
been
talk
about
your
mother
and
that
johnson
does
some
of
it
i
do
know
because
naturally
nobody
would
come
to
me
with
such
stuff
or
mention
it
before
me
but
it
presumably
true
i
suppose
it
is
i
seen
fanny
with
johnson
quite
a
lot
and
that
old
lady
is
a
notorious
gossip
and
that
why
she
ordered
you
out
of
her
house
when
you
pinned
her
down
that
she
been
gossiping
i
have
a
suspicion
johnson
has
been
quite
a
comfort
to
fanny
in
their
long
talks
but
she
probably
quit
speaking
to
her
over
this
because
fanny
told
you
i
suppose
it
true
that
the
town
a
lot
of
others
that
is
do
share
in
the
gossip
in
this
town
naturally
anything
about
any
amberson
has
always
been
a
stone
dropped
into
the
centre
of
a
pond
and
a
lie
would
send
the
ripples
as
far
as
a
truth
would
i
been
on
a
steamer
when
the
story
went
all
over
the
boat
the
second
day
out
that
the
prettiest
girl
on
board
did
have
any
ears
and
you
can
take
it
as
a
rule
that
when
a
woman
past
the
prettier
her
hair
is
the
more
certain
you
are
to
meet
somebody
with
reliable
information
that
it
a
wig
you
can
be
sure
that
for
many
years
there
been
more
gossip
in
this
place
about
the
ambersons
than
about
any
other
family
i
dare
say
it
is
so
much
so
now
as
it
used
to
be
because
the
town
got
too
big
long
ago
but
it
the
truth
that
the
more
prominent
you
are
the
more
gossip
there
is
about
you
and
the
more
people
would
like
to
pull
you
down
well
they
ca
do
it
as
long
as
you
refuse
to
know
what
gossip
there
is
about
you
but
the
minute
you
notice
it
it
got
you
i
not
speaking
of
certain
kinds
of
slander
that
sometimes
people
have
got
to
take
to
the
courts
i
talking
of
the
wretched
buzzing
the
do
the
thing
you
seem
to
have
such
a
horror
of
people
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
assailed
your
mother
people
who
have
repeated
a
slander
either
get
ashamed
or
forget
it
if
let
alone
challenge
them
and
in
they
believe
everything
they
said
they
rather
believe
you
a
sinner
than
believe
themselves
liars
naturally
submit
to
gossip
and
you
kill
it
fight
it
and
you
make
it
strong
people
will
forget
almost
any
slander
except
one
been
is
that
all
george
asked
i
suppose
so
his
uncle
murmured
sadly
well
then
may
i
ask
what
you
have
done
in
my
place
i
not
sure
georgie
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
like
you
in
many
ways
especially
in
not
being
very
so
i
ca
say
youth
ca
be
trusted
for
much
except
asserting
itself
and
fighting
and
making
indeed
george
snorted
may
i
ask
what
you
think
i
ought
to
have
done
george
echoed
mocking
bitterly
i
suppose
you
think
i
mean
to
let
my
mother
good
name
your
mother
good
name
amberson
cut
him
off
impatiently
nobody
has
a
good
name
in
a
bad
mouth
nobody
has
a
good
name
in
a
silly
mouth
either
well
your
mother
name
was
in
some
silly
mouths
and
all
you
done
was
to
go
and
have
a
scene
with
the
worst
old
woman
gossip
in
the
town
a
scene
that
going
to
make
her
into
a
partisan
against
your
mother
whereas
she
was
a
mere
prattler
before
do
you
suppose
she
be
all
over
town
with
this
why
have
her
telephone
going
as
long
as
any
of
her
friends
are
up
people
that
never
heard
anything
about
this
are
going
to
hear
it
all
now
with
embellishments
and
she
see
to
it
that
everybody
hinted
anything
about
poor
isabel
will
know
that
you
on
the
warpath
and
that
will
put
them
on
the
defensive
and
make
them
vicious
the
story
will
grow
as
it
spreads
and
george
unfolded
his
arms
to
strike
his
right
fist
into
his
left
palm
but
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
tolerate
such
things
he
shouted
what
do
you
suppose
i
be
doing
nothing
oh
you
think
so
do
you
you
can
do
absolutely
nothing
said
amberson
nothing
of
any
use
the
more
you
do
the
more
harm
you
you
see
i
going
to
stop
this
thing
if
i
have
to
force
my
way
into
every
house
on
national
avenue
and
amberson
boulevard
his
uncle
laughed
rather
sourly
but
made
no
other
comment
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
george
demanded
do
you
propose
to
sit
there
and
let
this
riffraff
bandy
my
mother
good
name
back
and
forth
among
them
is
that
what
you
propose
to
do
it
all
i
can
do
amberson
returned
it
all
any
of
us
can
do
now
just
sit
still
and
hope
that
the
thing
may
die
down
in
time
in
spite
of
your
stirring
up
that
awful
old
george
drew
a
long
breath
then
advanced
and
stood
close
before
his
uncle
did
you
understand
me
when
i
told
you
that
people
are
saying
my
mother
means
to
marry
this
man
yes
i
understood
you
say
that
my
going
over
there
has
made
matters
worse
george
went
on
how
about
it
if
such
a
such
an
unspeakable
marriage
did
take
place
do
you
think
that
would
make
people
believe
they
been
wrong
in
saying
you
know
what
they
no
said
amberson
deliberately
i
do
believe
it
would
there
be
more
badness
in
the
bad
mouths
and
more
silliness
in
the
silly
mouths
i
dare
say
but
it
would
hurt
isabel
and
eugene
if
they
never
heard
of
it
and
if
they
did
hear
of
it
then
they
could
take
their
choice
between
placating
gossip
or
living
for
their
own
happiness
if
they
have
decided
to
marry
george
almost
staggered
good
god
he
gasped
you
speak
of
it
calmly
amberson
looked
up
at
him
inquiringly
why
should
they
marry
if
they
want
to
he
asked
it
their
own
why
should
they
george
echoed
why
should
they
yes
why
should
they
i
do
see
anything
precisely
monstrous
about
two
people
getting
married
when
they
both
free
and
care
about
each
other
what
the
matter
with
their
marrying
it
would
be
monstrous
george
shouted
monstrous
even
if
this
horrible
thing
had
happened
but
now
in
the
face
of
this
oh
that
you
can
sit
there
and
even
speak
of
it
your
own
sister
o
god
oh
he
became
incoherent
swinging
away
from
amberson
and
making
for
the
door
wildly
gesturing
for
heaven
sake
do
be
so
theatrical
said
his
uncle
and
then
seeing
that
george
was
leaving
the
room
come
back
here
you
speak
to
your
mother
of
this
do
to
george
said
indistinctly
and
he
plunged
out
into
the
big
dimly
lit
hall
he
passed
his
grandfather
room
on
the
way
to
the
stairs
and
the
major
was
visible
within
his
white
head
brightly
illumined
by
a
lamp
as
he
bent
low
over
a
ledger
upon
his
desk
he
did
not
look
up
and
his
grandson
strode
by
the
door
not
really
conscious
of
the
old
figure
stooping
at
its
tremulous
work
with
long
additions
and
subtractions
that
refused
to
balance
as
they
used
to
george
went
home
and
got
a
hat
and
overcoat
without
seeing
either
his
mother
or
fanny
then
he
left
word
that
he
would
be
out
for
dinner
and
hurried
away
from
the
house
he
walked
the
dark
streets
of
amberson
addition
for
an
hour
then
went
downtown
and
got
coffee
at
a
restaurant
after
that
he
walked
through
the
lighted
parts
of
the
town
until
ten
when
he
turned
north
and
came
back
to
the
purlieus
of
the
addition
he
strode
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
it
again
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
forehead
his
overcoat
collar
turned
up
behind
he
walked
fiercely
though
his
feet
ached
but
by
and
by
he
turned
homeward
and
when
he
reached
the
major
went
in
and
sat
upon
the
steps
of
the
huge
stone
veranda
in
front
an
obscure
figure
in
that
lonely
and
repellent
place
all
lights
were
out
at
the
major
and
finally
after
twelve
he
saw
his
window
darken
at
home
he
waited
half
an
hour
longer
then
crossed
the
front
yards
of
the
new
houses
and
let
himself
noiselessly
in
the
front
door
the
light
in
the
hall
had
been
left
burning
and
another
in
his
own
room
as
he
discovered
when
he
got
there
he
locked
the
door
quickly
and
without
noise
but
his
fingers
were
still
upon
the
key
when
there
was
a
quick
footfall
in
the
hall
outside
georgie
dear
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
before
replying
yes
i
been
wondering
where
you
were
had
you
there
was
a
pause
then
she
said
timidly
wherever
it
was
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
after
a
silence
thank
you
he
said
without
expression
another
silence
followed
before
she
spoke
again
you
would
care
to
be
kissed
i
suppose
and
with
a
little
flurry
of
placative
laughter
she
added
at
your
age
of
course
i
going
to
bed
now
he
said
another
silence
seemed
blanker
than
those
which
had
preceded
it
and
finally
her
voice
came
it
was
blank
too
after
he
was
in
bed
his
thoughts
became
more
tumultuous
than
ever
while
among
all
the
inchoate
and
fragmentary
sketches
of
this
dreadful
day
now
rising
before
him
the
clearest
was
of
his
uncle
collapsed
in
a
big
chair
with
a
white
tie
dangling
from
his
hand
and
one
conviction
following
upon
that
picture
became
definite
in
george
mind
that
his
uncle
george
amberson
was
a
hopeless
dreamer
from
whom
no
help
need
be
expected
an
amiable
imbecile
lacking
in
normal
impulses
and
wholly
useless
in
a
struggle
which
required
honour
to
be
defended
by
a
man
of
action
then
would
return
a
vision
of
johnson
furious
round
head
set
behind
her
great
bosom
like
the
sun
far
sunk
on
the
horizon
of
a
mountain
plateau
and
her
crackling
asthmatic
voice
without
sharing
in
other
people
disposition
to
put
an
evil
interpretation
on
what
may
be
nothing
more
than
unfortunate
other
people
may
be
less
considerate
in
not
confining
their
discussion
of
it
as
i
have
to
charitable
you
know
something
pretty
quick
you
know
you
out
in
the
and
then
george
would
get
up
again
and
again
and
pace
the
floor
in
his
bare
feet
that
was
what
the
tormented
young
man
was
doing
when
daylight
came
gauntly
in
at
his
window
pacing
the
floor
rubbing
his
head
in
his
hands
and
muttering
it
ca
be
true
this
ca
be
happening
to
me
chapter
xxiv
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
in
his
room
as
usual
but
he
did
not
make
his
normal
healthy
raid
upon
the
dainty
tray
the
food
remained
untouched
and
he
sustained
himself
upon
coffee
four
cups
of
it
which
left
nothing
of
value
inside
the
glistening
little
percolator
during
this
process
he
heard
his
mother
being
summoned
to
the
telephone
in
the
hall
not
far
from
his
door
and
then
her
voice
responding
yes
oh
it
you
indeed
i
should
of
then
i
expect
you
about
three
yes
till
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
her
speaking
to
someone
beneath
his
window
and
looking
out
saw
her
directing
the
removal
of
plants
from
a
small
garden
bed
to
the
conservatory
for
the
winter
there
was
an
air
of
briskness
about
her
as
she
turned
away
to
go
into
the
house
she
laughed
gaily
with
the
gardener
over
something
he
said
and
this
unconcerned
cheerfulness
of
her
was
terrible
to
her
son
he
went
to
his
desk
and
searching
the
jumbled
contents
of
a
drawer
brought
forth
a
large
unframed
photograph
of
his
father
upon
which
he
gazed
long
and
piteously
till
at
last
hot
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
it
was
strange
how
the
inconsequent
face
of
wilbur
seemed
to
increase
in
high
significance
during
this
belated
interview
between
father
and
son
and
how
it
seemed
to
take
on
a
reproachful
nobility
and
yet
under
the
circumstances
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
that
george
having
paid
but
the
slightest
attention
to
his
father
in
life
should
begin
to
deify
him
now
that
he
was
dead
poor
poor
father
the
son
whispered
brokenly
poor
man
i
glad
you
did
know
he
wrapped
the
picture
in
a
sheet
of
newspaper
put
it
under
his
arm
and
leaving
the
house
hurriedly
and
stealthily
went
downtown
to
the
shop
of
a
silversmith
where
he
spent
sixty
dollars
on
a
resplendently
festooned
silver
frame
for
the
picture
having
lunched
upon
more
coffee
he
returned
to
the
house
at
two
carrying
the
framed
photograph
with
him
and
placed
it
upon
the
in
the
library
the
room
most
used
by
isabel
and
fanny
and
himself
then
he
went
to
a
front
window
of
the
long
reception
room
and
sat
looking
out
through
the
lace
curtains
the
house
was
quiet
though
once
or
twice
he
heard
his
mother
and
fanny
moving
about
upstairs
and
a
ripple
of
song
in
the
voice
of
isabel
a
fragment
from
the
romantic
ballad
of
lord
bateman
lord
bateman
was
a
noble
lord
a
noble
lord
of
high
degree
and
he
sailed
west
and
he
sailed
east
far
countries
for
to
see
the
words
became
indistinct
the
air
was
hummed
absently
the
humming
shifted
to
a
whistle
then
drifted
out
of
hearing
and
the
place
was
still
again
george
looked
often
at
his
watch
but
his
vigil
did
not
last
an
hour
at
ten
minutes
of
three
peering
through
the
curtain
he
saw
an
automobile
stop
in
front
of
the
house
and
eugene
morgan
jump
lightly
down
from
it
the
car
was
of
a
new
pattern
low
and
long
with
an
ample
seat
in
the
tonneau
facing
forward
and
a
professional
driver
sat
at
the
wheel
a
strange
figure
in
leather
goggled
out
of
all
personality
and
seemingly
part
of
the
mechanism
eugene
himself
as
he
came
up
the
cement
path
to
the
house
was
a
figure
of
the
new
era
which
was
in
time
to
be
so
disastrous
to
stiff
hats
and
skirted
coats
and
his
appearance
afforded
a
debonair
contrast
to
that
of
the
duck
capering
at
the
amberson
ball
in
an
old
dress
coat
and
chugging
up
national
avenue
through
the
snow
in
his
nightmare
of
a
eugene
this
afternoon
was
richly
in
the
new
outdoor
mode
motoring
coat
was
soft
gray
fur
his
cap
and
gloves
were
of
gray
suede
and
though
lucy
hand
may
have
shown
itself
in
the
selection
of
these
garnitures
he
wore
them
easily
even
with
becoming
hint
of
jauntiness
some
change
might
be
his
face
too
for
a
successful
man
is
seldom
to
be
mistaken
especially
if
his
temper
be
genial
eugene
had
begun
to
look
like
a
millionaire
but
above
everything
else
what
was
most
evident
about
him
as
he
came
up
the
path
was
confidence
in
the
happiness
promised
by
his
errand
the
anticipation
in
his
eyes
could
have
been
read
by
a
stranger
his
look
at
the
door
of
isabel
house
was
the
look
of
a
man
who
is
quite
certain
that
the
next
moment
will
reveal
something
ineffably
charming
inexpressibly
dear
when
the
bell
rang
george
waited
at
the
entrance
of
the
reception
room
until
a
housemaid
came
through
the
hall
on
her
way
to
answer
the
summons
you
need
mind
mary
he
told
her
i
see
who
it
is
and
what
they
want
probably
it
only
a
thank
you
sir
mister
george
said
mary
and
returned
to
the
rear
of
the
house
george
went
slowly
to
the
front
door
and
halted
regarding
the
misty
silhouette
of
the
caller
upon
the
ornamental
frosted
glass
after
a
minute
of
waiting
this
silhouette
changed
outline
so
that
an
arm
could
be
distinguished
an
arm
outstretched
toward
the
bell
as
if
the
gentleman
outside
doubted
whether
or
not
it
had
sounded
and
were
minded
to
try
again
but
before
the
gesture
was
completed
george
abruptly
threw
open
the
door
and
stepped
squarely
upon
the
middle
of
the
threshold
a
slight
change
shadowed
the
face
of
eugene
his
look
of
happy
anticipation
gave
way
to
something
formal
and
polite
how
do
you
do
george
he
said
mrs
minafer
expects
to
go
driving
with
me
i
believe
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
send
her
word
that
i
george
made
not
the
slightest
movement
no
he
said
eugene
was
incredulous
even
when
his
second
glance
revealed
how
hot
of
eye
was
the
haggard
young
man
before
him
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
heard
you
said
george
you
said
you
had
an
engagement
with
my
mother
and
i
told
you
no
eugene
gave
him
a
steady
look
and
then
he
quietly
what
is
the
the
difficulty
george
kept
his
own
voice
quiet
enough
but
that
did
not
mitigate
the
vibrant
fury
of
it
my
mother
will
have
no
interest
in
knowing
that
you
came
here
he
said
or
any
other
day
eugene
continued
to
look
at
him
with
a
scrutiny
in
which
began
to
gleam
a
profound
anger
none
less
powerful
because
it
was
so
quiet
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
understand
i
doubt
if
i
could
make
it
much
plainer
george
said
raising
his
voice
slightly
but
i
try
you
not
wanted
in
this
house
morgan
now
or
at
any
other
time
perhaps
you
understand
this
and
with
the
last
word
he
closed
the
door
in
eugene
face
then
not
moving
away
he
stood
just
inside
door
and
noted
that
the
misty
silhouette
remained
upon
the
frosted
glass
for
several
moments
as
if
the
forbidden
gentleman
debated
in
his
mind
what
course
to
pursue
let
him
ring
again
george
thought
grimly
or
try
the
side
door
or
the
kitchen
but
eugene
made
no
further
attempt
the
silhouette
disappeared
footsteps
could
be
heard
withdrawing
across
the
floor
of
the
veranda
and
george
returning
to
the
window
in
the
reception
room
was
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
an
automobile
manufacturer
in
baffled
retreat
with
all
his
wooing
furs
and
fineries
mocking
him
eugene
got
into
his
car
slowly
not
looking
back
at
the
house
which
had
just
taught
him
such
a
lesson
and
it
was
easily
visible
even
from
a
window
seventy
feet
distant
that
he
was
not
the
same
light
suitor
who
had
jumped
so
gallantly
from
the
car
only
a
few
minutes
earlier
observing
the
heaviness
of
his
movements
as
he
climbed
into
the
tonneau
george
indulged
in
a
sickish
throat
rumble
which
bore
a
distant
cousinship
to
mirth
the
car
was
quicker
than
its
owner
it
shot
away
as
soon
as
he
had
sunk
into
his
seat
and
george
having
watched
its
impetuous
disappearance
from
his
field
of
vision
ceased
to
haunt
the
window
he
went
to
the
library
and
seating
himself
beside
the
table
whereon
he
had
placed
the
photograph
of
his
father
picked
up
a
book
and
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
reading
it
presently
isabel
buoyant
step
was
heard
descending
the
stairs
and
her
low
sweet
whistling
renewing
the
air
of
lord
she
came
into
the
library
still
whistling
thoughtfully
a
fur
coat
over
her
arm
ready
to
put
on
and
two
veils
round
her
small
black
hat
her
right
hand
engaged
in
buttoning
the
glove
upon
her
left
and
as
the
large
room
contained
too
many
pieces
of
heavy
furniture
and
the
inside
shutters
excluded
most
of
the
light
of
day
she
did
not
at
once
perceive
presence
instead
she
went
to
the
bay
window
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
afforded
a
view
of
the
street
and
glanced
out
expectantly
then
bent
her
attention
upon
her
glove
after
that
looked
out
toward
the
street
again
ceased
to
whistle
and
turned
toward
the
interior
of
the
room
why
georgie
she
came
leaned
over
from
behind
him
and
there
was
a
faint
exquisite
odour
as
from
distant
apple
blossoms
as
she
kissed
his
cheek
dear
i
waited
lunch
almost
an
hour
for
you
but
you
did
come
did
you
lunch
out
somewhere
he
did
not
look
up
from
the
book
did
you
have
plenty
to
eat
are
you
sure
would
you
like
to
have
maggie
get
you
something
now
in
the
dining
room
or
they
could
bring
it
to
you
here
if
you
think
it
would
be
cozier
sha
i
a
tinkling
bell
was
audible
and
she
moved
to
the
doorway
into
the
hall
i
going
out
driving
dear
i
she
interrupted
herself
to
address
the
housemaid
who
was
passing
through
the
hall
i
think
it
morgan
mary
tell
him
i
be
there
at
yes
mary
returned
twas
a
pedlar
another
one
isabel
said
surprised
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
pedlar
when
the
bell
rang
a
little
while
mister
george
said
it
was
he
went
to
the
door
mary
informed
her
disappearing
there
seem
to
be
a
great
many
of
them
isabel
mused
what
did
yours
want
to
sell
george
he
did
you
must
have
cut
him
off
short
she
laughed
and
then
still
standing
in
the
doorway
she
noticed
the
big
silver
frame
upon
the
table
beside
him
gracious
georgie
she
exclaimed
you
have
been
investing
and
as
she
came
across
the
room
for
a
closer
view
is
it
is
it
lucy
she
asked
half
timidly
half
archly
but
the
next
instant
she
saw
whose
likeness
was
thus
set
forth
in
elegiac
splendour
and
she
was
silent
except
for
a
long
oh
he
neither
looked
up
nor
moved
that
was
nice
of
you
georgie
she
said
in
a
low
voice
presently
i
ought
to
have
had
it
framed
myself
when
i
gave
it
to
he
said
nothing
and
standing
beside
him
she
put
her
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder
then
as
gently
withdrew
it
and
went
out
of
the
room
but
she
did
not
go
upstairs
he
heard
the
faint
rustle
of
her
dress
in
the
hall
and
then
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
in
the
reception
after
a
time
silence
succeeded
even
these
slight
tokens
of
her
presence
whereupon
george
rose
and
went
warily
into
the
hall
taking
care
to
make
no
noise
and
he
obtained
an
oblique
view
of
her
through
the
open
double
doors
of
the
reception
she
was
sitting
in
the
chair
which
he
had
occupied
so
long
and
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
expectantly
a
little
troubled
he
went
back
to
the
library
waited
an
interminable
half
hour
then
returned
noiselessly
to
the
same
position
in
the
hall
where
he
could
see
her
she
was
still
sitting
patiently
by
the
window
waiting
for
that
man
was
she
well
it
might
be
quite
a
long
wait
and
the
grim
george
silently
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
own
room
and
began
to
pace
his
suffering
floor
chapter
xxv
he
left
his
door
open
however
and
when
he
heard
the
front
ring
by
and
by
he
went
half
way
down
the
stairs
and
stood
to
listen
he
was
not
much
afraid
that
morgan
would
return
but
he
wished
to
make
sure
mary
appeared
in
the
hall
below
him
but
after
a
glance
toward
the
front
of
the
house
turned
back
and
withdrew
evidently
isabel
had
gone
to
the
door
then
a
murmur
was
heard
and
george
amberson
voice
quick
and
serious
i
want
to
talk
to
you
isabel
and
another
murmur
then
isabel
and
her
brother
passed
the
foot
of
the
broad
dark
stairway
but
did
not
look
up
and
remained
unconscious
of
the
watchful
presence
above
them
isabel
still
carried
her
cloak
upon
her
arm
but
amberson
had
taken
her
hand
and
retained
it
and
as
he
led
her
silently
into
the
library
there
was
something
about
her
attitude
and
the
pose
of
her
slightly
bent
head
that
was
both
startled
and
meek
thus
they
quickly
disappeared
from
george
sight
hand
in
hand
and
amberson
at
once
closed
the
massive
double
doors
of
the
library
for
a
time
all
that
george
could
hear
was
the
indistinct
sound
of
his
uncle
voice
what
he
was
saying
could
not
be
surmised
though
the
troubled
brotherliness
of
his
tone
was
evident
he
seemed
to
be
explaining
something
at
considerable
length
and
there
were
moments
when
he
paused
and
george
guessed
that
his
mother
was
speaking
but
her
voice
must
have
been
very
low
for
it
was
entirely
inaudible
to
him
suddenly
he
did
hear
her
through
the
heavy
doors
her
outcry
came
clear
and
loud
oh
no
it
was
a
cry
of
protest
as
if
something
her
brother
told
her
must
be
untrue
or
if
it
were
true
the
fact
he
stated
must
be
undone
and
it
was
a
sound
of
sheer
pain
another
sound
of
pain
close
to
george
followed
it
this
was
a
vehement
sniffling
which
broke
out
just
above
him
and
looking
up
he
saw
fanny
minafer
on
the
landing
leaning
over
the
banisters
and
applying
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
nose
i
can
guess
what
that
was
about
she
whispered
huskily
he
just
told
her
what
you
did
to
eugene
george
gave
her
a
dark
look
over
his
shoulder
you
go
on
back
to
your
room
he
said
and
he
began
to
descend
the
stairs
but
fanny
guessing
his
purpose
rushed
down
and
caught
his
arm
detaining
him
you
not
going
in
there
she
whispered
huskily
you
do
let
go
of
me
but
she
clung
to
him
savagely
no
you
do
georgie
minafer
keep
away
from
there
you
will
you
let
go
of
i
wo
you
come
back
here
you
come
upstairs
and
let
them
alone
that
what
you
do
and
with
such
passionate
determination
did
she
clutch
and
tug
never
losing
a
grip
of
him
somewhere
though
george
tried
as
much
as
he
could
without
hurting
her
to
wrench
away
with
such
utter
forgetfulness
of
her
maiden
dignity
did
she
assault
him
that
she
forced
him
stumbling
upward
to
the
landing
of
all
the
ridiculous
he
began
furiously
but
she
spared
one
hand
from
its
grasp
of
his
sleeve
and
clapped
it
over
his
mouth
hush
up
never
for
an
instant
in
this
grotesque
struggle
did
fanny
raise
her
voice
above
a
husky
whisper
hush
up
it
indecent
like
squabbling
outside
the
door
of
an
go
on
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
go
on
and
when
george
had
most
unwillingly
obeyed
she
planted
herself
in
his
way
on
the
top
step
there
she
said
the
idea
of
your
going
in
there
now
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
with
the
sudden
departure
of
the
nervous
vigour
she
had
shown
so
amazingly
she
began
to
cry
again
i
was
an
awful
fool
i
thought
you
knew
what
was
going
on
or
i
never
never
would
have
done
it
do
you
suppose
i
dreamed
you
go
making
everything
into
such
a
tragedy
do
you
i
do
care
what
you
dreamed
george
muttered
but
fanny
went
on
always
taking
care
to
keep
her
voice
from
getting
too
loud
in
spite
of
her
most
grievous
agitation
do
you
dream
i
thought
you
go
making
such
a
fool
of
yourself
at
johnson
oh
i
saw
her
this
morning
she
would
talk
to
me
but
i
met
george
amberson
on
my
way
back
and
he
told
me
what
you
done
over
there
and
do
you
dream
i
thought
you
do
what
you
done
here
this
afternoon
to
eugene
oh
i
knew
that
too
i
was
looking
out
of
the
front
bedroom
window
and
i
saw
him
drive
up
and
then
go
away
again
and
i
knew
you
been
to
the
door
of
course
he
went
to
george
amberson
about
it
and
that
why
george
is
here
he
got
to
tell
isabel
the
whole
thing
now
and
you
wanted
to
go
in
there
interfering
god
knows
what
you
stay
here
and
let
her
brother
tell
her
he
got
some
consideration
for
her
i
suppose
you
think
i
have
george
said
challenging
her
and
at
that
fanny
laughed
witheringly
you
considerate
of
anybody
i
considerate
of
her
good
name
he
said
hotly
it
seems
to
me
that
about
the
first
thing
to
be
considerate
of
in
being
considerate
of
a
person
and
look
here
it
strikes
me
you
taking
a
pretty
different
tack
from
what
you
did
yesterday
afternoon
fanny
wrung
her
hands
i
did
a
terrible
thing
she
lamented
now
that
it
done
and
too
late
i
know
what
it
was
i
did
have
sense
enough
just
to
let
things
go
on
i
did
have
any
business
to
interfere
and
i
did
mean
to
interfere
i
only
wanted
to
talk
and
let
out
a
little
i
did
think
you
already
knew
everything
i
told
you
i
did
and
i
rather
have
cut
my
hand
off
than
stir
you
up
to
doing
what
you
have
done
i
was
just
suffering
so
that
i
wanted
to
let
out
a
little
i
did
mean
any
real
harm
but
now
i
see
what
happened
oh
i
was
a
fool
i
had
any
business
interfering
eugene
never
would
have
looked
at
me
anyhow
and
oh
why
could
i
have
seen
that
before
he
never
came
here
a
single
time
in
his
life
except
on
her
account
never
and
i
might
have
let
them
alone
because
he
would
have
looked
at
me
even
if
he
never
seen
isabel
and
they
have
done
any
harm
she
made
wilbur
happy
and
she
was
a
true
wife
to
him
as
long
as
he
lived
it
was
a
crime
for
her
to
care
for
eugene
all
the
time
she
certainly
never
told
him
she
did
and
she
gave
me
every
chance
in
the
world
she
left
us
alone
together
every
time
she
could
even
since
wilbur
died
but
what
was
the
use
and
here
i
go
not
doing
myself
a
bit
of
good
by
it
and
just
fanny
wrung
her
hands
again
just
ruining
them
i
suppose
you
mean
i
doing
that
george
said
bitterly
yes
i
do
she
sobbed
and
drooped
upon
the
stairway
railing
exhausted
on
the
contrary
i
mean
to
save
my
mother
from
a
fanny
looked
at
him
wanly
in
a
tired
despair
then
she
stepped
by
him
and
went
slowly
to
her
own
door
where
she
paused
and
beckoned
to
him
what
do
you
want
just
come
here
a
what
for
he
asked
impatiently
i
just
wanted
to
say
something
to
well
for
heaven
sake
say
it
there
nobody
to
nevertheless
after
a
moment
as
she
beckoned
him
again
he
went
to
her
profoundly
annoyed
well
what
is
it
george
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
think
you
ought
to
be
told
something
if
i
were
you
i
let
my
mother
oh
my
lord
he
groaned
i
doing
these
things
for
her
not
against
her
a
mildness
had
come
upon
fanny
and
she
had
controlled
her
weeping
she
shook
her
head
gently
no
i
let
her
alone
if
i
were
you
i
think
she
very
well
she
i
never
saw
a
healthier
person
in
my
no
she
does
let
anybody
know
but
she
goes
to
the
doctor
women
are
always
going
to
doctors
no
he
told
her
george
was
not
impressed
it
nothing
at
all
she
spoke
of
it
to
me
years
ago
some
kind
of
family
failing
she
said
grandfather
had
it
too
and
look
at
him
has
proved
very
serious
with
him
you
act
as
if
i
done
something
wrong
in
sending
that
man
about
his
business
and
as
if
i
were
going
to
persecute
my
mother
instead
of
protecting
her
by
jove
it
sickening
you
told
me
how
all
the
riffraff
in
town
were
busy
with
her
name
and
then
the
minute
i
lift
my
hand
to
protect
her
you
begin
to
attack
me
and
sh
fanny
checked
him
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
your
uncle
is
the
library
doors
were
heard
opening
and
a
moment
later
there
came
the
sound
of
the
front
door
closing
george
moved
toward
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
stood
listening
but
the
house
was
silent
fanny
made
a
slight
noise
with
her
lips
to
attract
his
attention
and
when
he
glanced
toward
her
shook
her
head
at
him
urgently
let
her
alone
she
whispered
she
down
there
by
herself
do
go
down
let
her
she
moved
a
few
steps
toward
him
and
halted
her
face
pallid
and
awestruck
and
then
both
stood
listening
for
anything
that
might
break
the
silence
downstairs
no
sound
came
to
them
that
poignant
silence
was
continued
throughout
long
long
minutes
while
the
two
listeners
stood
there
under
its
mysterious
spell
and
in
its
plaintive
eloquence
speaking
as
it
did
of
the
figure
alone
in
the
big
dark
library
where
dead
wilbur
new
silver
frame
gleamed
in
the
dimness
there
was
something
that
checked
even
george
above
the
aunt
and
nephew
as
they
kept
this
strange
vigil
there
was
a
triple
window
of
stained
glass
to
illumine
the
landing
and
upper
reaches
of
the
stairway
figures
in
blue
and
amber
garments
posed
gracefully
in
panels
conceived
by
some
craftsman
of
the
eighties
to
represent
love
and
purity
and
beauty
and
these
figures
leaded
to
unalterable
attitudes
were
little
more
motionless
than
the
two
human
beings
upon
whom
fell
the
mottled
faint
light
of
the
window
the
colours
were
growing
dull
evening
was
coming
on
fanny
minafer
broke
the
long
silence
with
a
sound
from
her
throat
a
stilled
gasp
and
with
that
great
companion
of
hers
her
handkerchief
retired
softly
to
the
loneliness
of
her
own
chamber
after
she
had
gone
george
looked
about
him
bleakly
then
on
tiptoe
crossed
the
hall
and
went
into
his
own
room
which
was
filled
with
twilight
still
tiptoeing
though
he
could
not
have
said
why
he
went
across
the
room
and
sat
down
heavily
in
a
chair
facing
the
window
outside
there
was
nothing
but
the
darkening
air
and
the
wall
of
the
nearest
of
the
new
houses
he
had
not
slept
at
all
the
night
before
and
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
preceding
day
at
lunch
but
he
felt
neither
drowsiness
nor
hunger
his
set
determination
filled
him
kept
him
but
too
wide
awake
and
his
gaze
at
the
grayness
beyond
the
window
was
and
bitter
darkness
had
closed
in
when
there
was
a
step
in
the
room
behind
him
then
someone
knelt
beside
the
chair
two
arms
went
round
him
with
infinite
compassion
a
gentle
head
rested
against
his
shoulder
and
there
came
the
faint
scent
as
of
far
away
you
must
be
troubled
darling
his
mother
whispered
chapter
xxvi
george
choked
for
an
instant
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
but
he
commanded
himself
bravely
dismissing
the
roused
by
her
compassion
how
can
i
help
but
be
he
said
no
she
soothed
him
you
must
you
must
be
troubled
no
matter
what
that
easy
enough
to
say
he
protested
and
he
moved
as
if
to
rise
just
let
stay
like
this
a
little
while
dear
just
a
minute
or
two
i
want
to
tell
you
brother
george
has
been
here
and
he
told
me
everything
about
about
how
unhappy
you
been
and
how
you
went
so
gallantly
to
that
old
woman
with
the
isabel
gave
a
sad
little
laugh
what
a
terrible
old
woman
she
is
what
a
really
terrible
thing
a
vulgar
old
woman
can
be
mother
i
and
again
he
moved
to
rise
must
you
it
seemed
to
me
such
a
comfortable
way
to
talk
well
she
yielded
he
rose
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
pressed
the
light
into
being
as
the
room
took
life
from
the
sudden
lines
of
fire
within
the
bulbs
isabel
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
and
with
a
faint
laugh
of
apologetic
protest
turned
quickly
away
from
george
what
she
meant
was
you
must
see
my
face
until
i
made
it
nicer
for
then
she
turned
again
to
him
her
eyes
downcast
but
no
sign
of
tears
in
them
and
she
contrived
to
show
him
that
there
was
the
semblance
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
she
still
wore
her
hat
and
in
her
unsteady
fingers
she
held
a
white
envelope
somewhat
crumpled
now
mother
wait
dearest
she
said
and
though
he
stood
stone
cold
she
lifted
her
arms
put
them
round
him
again
and
pressed
her
cheek
lightly
to
his
oh
you
do
look
so
troubled
poor
dear
one
thing
you
doubt
beloved
boy
you
know
i
could
never
care
for
anything
in
the
world
as
i
care
for
you
never
never
now
mother
she
released
him
and
stepped
back
just
a
moment
more
dearest
i
want
you
to
read
this
first
we
can
get
at
things
she
pressed
into
his
hand
the
envelope
she
had
brought
with
her
and
as
he
opened
it
and
began
to
read
the
long
enclosure
she
walked
slowly
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
then
stood
there
with
her
back
to
him
and
her
head
drooping
a
little
until
he
had
finished
the
sheets
of
paper
were
covered
with
eugene
handwriting
george
amberson
will
bring
you
this
dear
isabel
he
is
waiting
while
i
write
he
and
i
have
talked
things
over
and
before
he
gives
this
to
you
he
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
of
course
i
rather
confused
and
have
had
time
to
think
matters
out
very
definitely
and
yet
i
believe
i
should
have
been
better
prepared
for
what
took
place
i
ought
to
have
known
it
was
coming
because
i
have
understood
for
quite
a
long
time
that
young
george
was
getting
to
dislike
me
more
and
more
somehow
i
never
been
able
to
get
his
friendship
he
always
had
a
latent
distrust
of
me
or
something
like
distrust
and
perhaps
that
made
me
sometimes
a
little
awkward
and
diffident
with
him
i
think
it
may
be
he
felt
from
the
first
that
i
cared
a
great
deal
about
you
and
he
naturally
resented
it
i
think
perhaps
he
felt
this
even
during
all
the
time
when
i
was
so
careful
at
least
i
thought
i
was
not
to
show
even
to
you
how
immensely
i
did
care
and
he
may
have
feared
that
you
were
thinking
too
much
about
me
even
when
you
were
and
only
liked
me
as
an
old
friend
it
perfectly
comprehensible
to
me
also
that
at
his
age
one
gets
excited
about
gossip
dear
isabel
what
i
trying
to
get
at
in
my
confused
way
is
that
you
and
i
do
care
about
this
nonsensical
gossip
ourselves
at
all
yesterday
i
thought
the
time
had
come
when
i
could
ask
you
to
marry
me
and
you
were
dear
enough
to
tell
me
sometime
it
might
come
to
well
you
and
i
left
to
ourselves
and
knowing
what
we
have
been
and
what
we
are
we
pay
as
much
attention
to
talk
as
we
would
to
any
other
kind
of
old
cats
mewing
we
not
be
very
apt
to
let
such
things
keep
us
from
the
plenty
of
life
we
have
left
to
us
for
making
up
to
ourselves
for
old
unhappinesses
and
mistakes
but
now
we
faced
with
not
the
slander
and
not
our
own
fear
of
it
because
we
have
any
but
someone
else
fear
of
it
your
son
and
oh
dearest
woman
in
the
world
i
know
what
your
son
is
to
you
and
it
frightens
me
let
me
explain
a
little
i
do
think
change
at
or
so
many
things
appear
solid
and
permanent
and
terrible
which
forty
sees
are
nothing
but
disappearing
miasma
forty
ca
tell
twenty
about
this
that
the
pity
of
it
twenty
can
find
out
only
by
getting
to
be
forty
and
so
we
come
to
this
dear
will
you
live
your
own
life
your
way
or
george
way
i
going
a
little
further
because
it
would
be
fatal
not
to
be
wholly
frank
now
george
will
act
toward
you
only
as
your
long
worship
of
him
your
sacrifices
all
the
unseen
little
ones
every
day
since
he
was
born
will
make
him
act
dear
it
breaks
my
heart
for
you
but
what
you
have
to
oppose
now
is
the
history
of
your
own
selfless
and
perfect
motherhood
i
remember
saying
once
that
what
you
worshipped
in
your
son
was
the
angel
you
saw
in
him
and
i
still
believe
that
is
true
of
every
mother
but
in
a
mother
worship
she
may
not
see
that
the
will
in
her
son
should
not
always
be
offered
incense
along
with
the
angel
i
grow
sick
with
fear
for
you
for
both
you
and
me
when
i
think
how
the
will
against
us
two
has
grown
strong
through
the
love
you
have
given
the
angel
and
how
long
your
own
sweet
will
has
served
that
other
are
you
strong
enough
isabel
can
you
make
the
fight
i
promise
you
that
if
you
will
take
heart
for
it
you
will
find
so
quickly
that
it
has
all
amounted
to
nothing
you
shall
have
happiness
and
in
a
little
while
only
happiness
you
need
only
to
write
me
a
line
i
ca
come
to
your
house
and
tell
me
where
you
will
meet
me
we
will
come
back
in
a
month
and
the
angel
in
your
son
will
bring
him
to
you
i
promise
it
what
is
good
in
him
will
grow
so
fine
once
you
have
beaten
the
turbulent
will
but
it
must
be
beaten
your
brother
that
good
friend
is
waiting
with
such
patience
i
should
not
keep
him
longer
and
i
am
saying
too
much
for
wisdom
i
fear
but
oh
my
dear
wo
you
be
strong
such
a
little
short
strength
it
would
need
do
strike
my
life
down
twice
dear
this
time
i
not
deserved
it
eugene
concluding
this
missive
george
tossed
it
abruptly
from
him
so
that
one
sheet
fell
upon
his
bed
and
the
others
upon
the
floor
and
at
the
faint
noise
of
their
falling
isabel
came
and
kneeling
began
to
gather
them
up
did
you
read
it
dear
george
face
was
pale
no
longer
but
pink
with
fury
yes
i
all
of
it
she
asked
gently
as
she
rose
certainly
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
kept
her
eyes
downcast
upon
the
letter
in
her
hands
tremulously
rearranging
the
sheets
in
order
as
she
spoke
and
though
she
smiled
her
smile
was
as
tremulous
as
her
hands
nervousness
and
an
irresistible
timidity
possessed
her
i
i
wanted
to
say
george
she
faltered
i
felt
that
if
if
some
day
it
should
happen
i
mean
if
you
came
to
feel
differently
about
it
and
eugene
and
i
that
is
if
we
found
that
it
seemed
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
i
was
afraid
you
might
think
it
would
be
a
little
queer
about
lucy
i
mean
if
if
she
were
your
of
course
she
not
be
even
legally
related
to
you
and
if
you
if
you
cared
for
her
thus
far
she
got
stumblingly
with
what
she
wanted
to
say
while
george
watched
her
with
a
gaze
that
grew
harder
and
hotter
but
here
he
cut
her
off
i
have
already
given
up
all
idea
of
lucy
he
said
naturally
i
could
have
treated
her
father
as
i
deliberately
did
treat
him
i
could
hardly
have
done
that
and
expected
his
daughter
ever
to
speak
to
me
isabel
gave
a
quick
cry
of
compassion
but
he
allowed
her
no
opportunity
to
speak
you
need
think
i
making
any
particular
sacrifice
he
said
sharply
though
i
would
quickly
enough
if
i
thought
it
necessary
in
a
matter
of
honour
like
this
i
was
interested
in
her
and
i
could
even
say
i
did
care
for
her
but
she
proved
pretty
satisfactorily
that
she
cared
little
enough
about
me
she
went
away
right
in
the
midst
of
a
of
a
difference
of
opinion
we
were
having
she
did
even
let
me
know
she
was
going
and
never
wrote
a
line
to
me
and
then
came
back
telling
everybody
she
had
perfectly
gorgeous
time
that
quite
enough
for
me
i
not
precisely
the
sort
to
arrange
for
that
kind
of
thing
to
be
done
to
me
more
than
once
the
truth
is
we
not
congenial
and
we
found
that
much
out
at
least
before
she
left
we
should
never
have
been
happy
she
was
all
the
time
and
critical
of
me
not
very
pleasant
that
i
was
disappointed
in
her
and
i
might
as
well
say
it
i
do
think
she
has
the
very
deepest
nature
in
the
world
and
but
isabel
put
her
hand
timidly
on
his
arm
georgie
dear
this
is
only
a
quarrel
all
young
people
have
them
before
they
get
adjusted
and
you
must
let
if
you
please
he
said
emphatically
moving
back
from
her
this
that
kind
it
all
over
and
i
do
care
to
speak
of
it
again
settled
do
you
understand
but
dear
no
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
letter
of
her
yes
dear
that
why
it
simply
the
most
offensive
piece
of
writing
that
i
ever
held
in
my
hands
she
stepped
back
from
him
startled
but
dear
i
thought
i
ca
understand
your
even
showing
me
such
a
thing
he
cried
how
did
you
happen
to
bring
it
to
me
your
uncle
thought
i
better
he
thought
it
was
the
simplest
thing
to
do
and
he
said
that
he
suggested
it
to
eugene
and
eugene
had
agreed
they
thought
yes
george
said
bitterly
i
should
like
to
hear
what
they
thought
they
thought
it
would
be
the
most
straightforward
george
drew
a
long
breath
well
what
do
you
think
mother
i
thought
it
would
be
the
simplest
and
most
straightforward
thing
i
thought
they
were
very
well
we
agree
it
was
simple
and
straightforward
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
letter
itself
she
hesitated
looking
away
i
of
course
i
do
agree
with
him
in
the
way
he
speaks
of
you
dear
except
about
the
angel
i
do
agree
with
some
of
the
things
he
implies
you
always
been
unselfish
nobody
knows
that
better
than
your
mother
when
fanny
was
left
with
nothing
you
were
so
quick
and
generous
to
give
up
what
really
should
have
come
to
you
and
and
yet
george
broke
in
you
see
what
he
implies
about
me
do
you
think
really
that
this
was
a
pretty
insulting
letter
for
that
man
to
be
asking
you
to
hand
your
son
oh
no
she
cried
you
can
see
how
fair
he
means
to
be
and
he
ask
for
me
to
give
it
to
you
it
was
brother
george
who
never
mind
that
now
you
say
he
tries
to
be
fair
and
yet
do
you
suppose
it
ever
occurs
to
him
that
i
doing
my
simple
duty
that
doing
what
my
father
would
do
if
he
were
alive
that
i
doing
what
my
father
would
ask
me
to
do
if
he
could
speak
from
his
grave
out
yonder
do
you
suppose
it
ever
occurs
to
that
man
for
one
minute
that
protecting
my
mother
george
raised
his
voice
advancing
upon
the
helpless
lady
fiercely
and
she
could
only
bend
her
head
before
him
he
talks
about
my
how
it
must
be
beaten
down
yes
and
he
asks
my
mother
to
do
that
little
thing
to
please
him
what
for
why
does
he
want
me
by
my
mother
because
i
trying
to
protect
her
name
got
my
mother
name
bandied
up
and
down
the
streets
of
this
town
till
i
ca
step
in
those
streets
without
wondering
what
every
soul
i
meet
is
thinking
of
me
and
of
my
family
and
now
he
wants
you
to
marry
him
so
that
every
gossip
in
town
will
say
what
did
i
tell
you
i
guess
that
proves
it
true
you
ca
get
away
from
it
that
exactly
what
they
say
and
this
man
pretends
he
cares
for
you
and
yet
asks
you
to
marry
him
and
give
them
the
right
to
say
it
he
says
he
and
you
care
what
they
say
but
i
know
better
he
may
not
care
probably
that
kind
but
you
do
there
never
was
an
amberson
yet
that
would
let
the
amberson
name
go
trailing
in
the
dust
like
that
it
the
proudest
name
in
this
town
and
it
going
to
stay
the
proudest
and
i
tell
you
that
the
deepest
thing
in
my
nature
not
that
i
expect
eugene
morgan
to
understand
the
very
deepest
thing
in
my
nature
is
to
protect
that
name
and
to
fight
for
it
to
the
last
breath
when
danger
threatens
it
as
it
does
now
through
my
mother
he
turned
from
her
striding
up
and
down
and
tossing
his
arms
about
in
a
tumult
of
gesture
i
believe
it
of
you
that
you
think
of
such
a
sacrilege
that
what
it
would
be
sacrilege
when
he
talks
about
your
unselfishness
toward
me
he
right
you
have
been
unselfish
and
you
have
been
a
perfect
mother
but
what
about
him
is
it
unselfish
of
him
to
want
you
to
throw
away
your
good
name
just
to
please
him
that
all
he
asks
of
you
and
to
quit
being
my
mother
do
you
think
i
can
believe
you
really
care
for
him
i
do
you
are
my
mother
and
you
an
amberson
and
i
believe
you
too
proud
you
too
proud
to
care
for
a
man
who
could
write
such
a
letter
as
that
he
stopped
faced
her
and
spoke
with
more
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
mother
george
was
right
about
his
mother
being
proud
and
even
when
she
laughed
with
a
negro
gardener
or
even
those
few
times
in
her
life
when
people
saw
her
weep
isabel
had
a
proud
look
something
that
was
independent
and
graceful
and
strong
but
she
did
not
have
it
now
she
leaned
against
the
wall
beside
his
and
seemed
beset
with
humility
and
with
weakness
her
head
drooped
what
answer
are
you
going
to
make
to
such
a
letter
george
demanded
like
a
judge
on
the
bench
i
i
do
quite
know
dear
she
murmured
wait
she
begged
him
i
so
i
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
write
him
do
you
think
if
you
did
what
he
wants
you
to
i
could
bear
to
stay
another
day
in
this
town
mother
do
you
think
i
could
ever
bear
even
to
see
you
again
if
you
married
him
i
want
to
but
you
surely
know
i
just
could
she
made
a
futile
gesture
and
seemed
to
breathe
with
difficulty
i
i
was
quite
sure
she
faltered
about
about
it
being
wise
for
us
to
be
married
even
before
knowing
how
you
feel
about
it
i
was
even
sure
it
was
quite
fair
to
to
eugene
i
have
i
seem
to
have
that
family
trouble
like
father
that
i
spoke
to
you
about
she
managed
a
deprecatory
little
dry
laugh
not
that
it
amounts
to
much
but
i
at
all
sure
that
it
would
be
fair
to
him
marrying
does
mean
so
much
after
all
not
at
my
age
it
enough
to
know
that
that
people
think
of
you
and
to
see
them
i
thought
we
were
all
oh
pretty
happy
the
way
things
were
and
i
do
think
it
would
mean
giving
up
a
great
deal
for
him
or
me
either
if
we
just
went
on
as
we
have
been
i
i
see
him
almost
every
day
and
mother
george
voice
was
loud
and
stern
do
you
think
you
could
go
on
seeing
him
after
this
she
had
been
talking
helplessly
enough
before
her
tone
was
little
more
broken
now
not
not
even
see
him
how
could
you
george
cried
mother
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
ever
set
foot
in
this
house
again
oh
i
ca
speak
of
it
could
you
see
him
knowing
what
talk
it
makes
every
time
he
turns
into
this
street
and
knowing
what
that
means
to
me
oh
i
do
understand
all
this
i
do
if
you
told
me
a
year
ago
that
such
things
were
going
to
happen
i
have
thought
you
were
insane
and
now
i
believe
i
am
then
after
a
preliminary
gesture
of
despair
as
though
he
meant
harm
to
the
ceiling
he
flung
himself
heavily
face
downward
upon
the
bed
his
anguish
was
none
the
less
real
for
its
vehemence
and
the
stricken
lady
came
to
him
instantly
and
bent
over
him
once
more
enfolding
him
in
her
arms
she
said
nothing
but
suddenly
her
tears
fell
upon
his
head
she
saw
them
and
seemed
to
be
startled
oh
this
wo
do
she
said
i
never
let
you
see
me
cry
before
except
when
your
father
died
i
must
and
she
ran
from
the
room
a
little
while
after
she
had
gone
george
rose
and
began
solemnly
to
dress
for
dinner
at
one
stage
of
these
conscientious
proceedings
he
put
on
temporarily
his
long
black
velvet
and
happening
to
catch
sight
in
his
pier
glass
of
the
picturesque
and
medieval
figure
thus
presented
he
paused
to
regard
it
and
something
profoundly
theatrical
in
his
nature
came
to
the
surface
his
lips
moved
he
whispered
some
famous
fragments
tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
for
in
truth
the
mirrored
princely
image
with
hair
dishevelled
on
the
white
brow
and
the
long
tragic
fall
of
black
velvet
from
the
shoulders
had
brought
about
in
his
thought
at
least
some
comparisons
of
his
own
times
so
out
of
joint
with
those
of
that
other
gentle
prince
and
heir
whose
widowed
mother
was
minded
to
marry
again
but
i
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
these
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
not
less
like
hamlet
did
he
feel
and
look
as
he
sat
gauntly
at
the
dinner
table
with
fanny
to
partake
of
a
meal
throughout
which
neither
spoke
isabel
had
sent
word
not
to
wait
for
her
an
injunction
it
was
as
well
they
obeyed
for
she
did
not
come
at
all
but
with
the
renewal
of
sustenance
furnished
to
his
system
some
relaxation
must
have
occurred
within
the
george
dinner
was
not
quite
finished
when
without
warning
sleep
hit
him
hard
his
burning
eyes
could
no
longer
restrain
the
lids
above
them
his
head
sagged
beyond
control
and
he
got
to
his
feet
and
went
lurching
upstairs
yawning
with
exhaustion
from
the
door
of
his
room
which
he
closed
mechanically
with
his
eyes
shut
he
went
blindly
to
his
bed
fell
upon
it
soddenly
and
slept
with
his
face
full
upturned
to
the
light
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
woke
and
the
room
was
dark
he
had
not
dreamed
but
he
woke
with
the
sense
that
somebody
or
something
had
been
with
him
while
he
slept
somebody
or
something
infinitely
compassionate
somebody
or
something
infinitely
protective
that
would
let
him
come
to
no
harm
and
to
no
grief
he
got
up
and
pressed
the
light
on
pinned
to
the
cover
of
his
was
a
square
envelope
with
the
words
for
you
dear
written
in
pencil
upon
it
but
the
message
inside
was
in
ink
a
little
smudged
here
and
there
i
have
been
out
to
the
darling
with
a
letter
i
written
to
eugene
and
he
have
it
in
the
morning
it
would
be
unfair
not
to
let
him
know
at
once
and
my
decision
could
not
change
if
i
waited
it
would
always
be
the
same
i
think
it
is
a
little
better
for
me
to
write
to
you
like
this
instead
of
waiting
till
you
wake
up
and
then
telling
you
because
i
foolish
and
might
cry
again
and
i
took
a
vow
once
long
ago
that
you
should
never
see
me
cry
not
that
i
feel
like
crying
when
we
talk
things
over
tomorrow
i
be
all
right
and
fine
as
you
say
so
often
by
that
time
do
fear
i
think
what
makes
me
most
ready
to
cry
now
is
the
thought
of
the
terrible
suffering
in
your
poor
face
and
the
unhappy
knowledge
that
it
is
i
your
mother
who
put
it
there
it
shall
never
come
again
i
love
you
better
than
anything
and
everything
else
on
earth
god
gave
you
to
me
and
oh
how
thankful
i
have
been
every
day
of
my
life
for
that
sacred
gift
and
nothing
can
ever
come
between
me
and
god
gift
i
can
not
hurt
you
and
i
can
not
let
you
stay
hurt
as
you
have
been
not
another
instant
after
you
wake
up
my
darling
boy
it
is
beyond
my
power
and
eugene
was
right
i
know
you
could
change
about
this
your
suffering
shows
how
the
feeling
is
within
you
so
i
written
him
just
about
what
i
think
you
would
like
me
to
though
i
told
him
i
would
always
be
fond
of
him
and
always
his
best
friend
and
i
hoped
his
dearest
friend
he
understand
about
not
seeing
him
he
understand
that
though
i
did
say
it
in
so
many
words
you
must
trouble
about
that
he
understand
my
darling
my
beloved
my
beloved
you
must
be
troubled
i
think
i
should
mind
anything
very
much
so
long
as
i
have
you
all
to
myself
as
people
say
to
make
up
for
your
long
years
away
from
me
at
college
we
talk
of
what
best
to
do
in
the
morning
sha
we
and
for
all
this
pain
you
forgive
your
loving
and
devoted
mother
isabel
chapter
xxvii
having
finished
some
errands
downtown
the
next
afternoon
george
amberson
minafer
was
walking
up
national
avenue
on
his
homeward
way
when
he
saw
in
the
distance
coming
toward
him
upon
the
same
side
of
the
street
the
figure
of
a
young
lady
a
figure
just
under
the
middle
height
comely
indeed
and
to
be
mistaken
for
none
other
in
the
world
even
at
two
hundred
yards
to
his
sharp
discomfiture
his
heart
immediately
forced
upon
him
the
consciousness
of
its
acceleration
a
sudden
warmth
about
his
neck
made
him
aware
that
he
had
turned
red
and
then
departing
left
him
pale
for
a
panicky
moment
he
thought
of
facing
about
in
actual
flight
he
had
little
doubt
that
lucy
would
meet
him
with
no
token
of
recognition
and
all
at
once
this
probability
struck
him
as
unendurable
and
if
she
did
not
speak
was
it
the
proper
part
of
chivalry
to
lift
his
hat
and
take
the
cut
bareheaded
or
should
the
finer
gentleman
acquiesce
in
the
lady
desire
for
no
further
acquaintance
and
pass
her
with
stony
mien
and
eyes
constrained
forward
george
was
a
young
man
badly
flustered
but
the
girl
approaching
him
was
unaware
of
his
trepidation
being
perhaps
somewhat
preoccupied
with
her
own
she
saw
only
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
eyes
were
darkly
circled
but
here
he
was
advantaged
with
her
for
the
finest
touch
to
his
good
looks
was
given
by
this
toning
down
neither
pallor
nor
dark
circles
detracting
from
them
but
rather
adding
to
them
a
melancholy
favour
of
distinction
george
had
retained
his
mourning
a
tribute
completed
down
to
the
final
details
of
black
gloves
and
a
polished
ebony
cane
which
he
would
have
been
pained
to
name
otherwise
than
as
a
and
in
the
aura
of
this
sombre
elegance
his
straight
figure
and
drawn
face
were
not
without
a
tristful
and
appealing
dignity
in
everything
outward
he
was
cause
enough
for
a
girl
cheek
to
flush
her
heart
to
beat
faster
and
her
eyes
to
warm
with
the
soft
light
that
came
into
lucy
now
whether
she
would
or
no
if
his
spirit
had
been
what
his
looks
proclaimed
it
she
would
have
rejoiced
to
let
the
light
glow
forth
which
now
shone
in
spite
of
her
for
a
long
time
thinking
of
that
spirit
of
his
and
what
she
felt
it
should
be
she
had
a
persistent
sense
it
must
be
there
but
she
had
determined
to
believe
this
folly
no
longer
nevertheless
when
she
met
him
at
the
sharons
she
had
been
far
less
calm
than
she
seemed
people
speaking
casually
of
lucy
were
apt
to
define
her
as
a
little
beauty
a
definition
short
of
the
mark
she
was
a
little
beauty
but
an
independent
masterful
little
american
of
whom
her
father
earlier
gipsyings
and
her
own
sturdiness
had
made
a
woman
ever
since
she
was
fifteen
but
though
she
was
the
mistress
of
her
own
ways
and
no
slave
to
any
lamp
save
that
of
her
own
conscience
she
had
a
weakness
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
george
amberson
minafer
at
first
sight
and
no
matter
how
she
disciplined
herself
she
had
never
been
able
to
climb
out
the
thing
had
happened
to
her
that
was
all
george
had
looked
just
the
way
she
had
always
wanted
someone
to
look
the
riskiest
of
all
the
moonshine
ambushes
wherein
tricky
romance
snares
credulous
young
love
but
what
was
fatal
to
lucy
was
that
this
thing
having
happened
to
her
she
could
not
change
it
no
matter
what
she
discovered
in
george
nature
she
was
unable
to
take
away
what
she
had
given
him
and
though
she
could
think
differently
about
him
she
could
not
feel
differently
about
him
for
she
was
one
of
those
too
faithful
victims
of
glamour
when
she
managed
to
keep
the
picture
of
george
away
from
her
mind
eye
she
did
well
enough
but
when
she
let
him
become
visible
she
could
not
choose
but
love
what
she
disdained
she
was
a
little
angel
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
lucifer
quite
an
experience
and
not
apt
to
be
soon
succeeded
by
any
falling
in
love
with
a
tamer
party
and
the
unhappy
truth
was
that
george
did
make
better
men
seem
tame
but
though
she
was
a
victim
she
was
a
heroic
one
anything
but
helpless
as
they
drew
nearer
george
tried
to
prepare
himself
to
meet
her
with
some
remnants
of
aplomb
he
decided
that
he
would
keep
on
looking
straight
ahead
and
lift
his
hand
toward
his
hat
at
the
very
last
moment
when
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
see
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
then
when
she
thought
it
over
later
she
would
not
be
sure
whether
he
had
saluted
her
or
merely
rubbed
his
forehead
and
there
was
the
added
benefit
that
any
third
person
who
might
chance
to
look
from
a
window
or
from
a
passing
carriage
would
not
think
that
he
was
receiving
a
snub
because
he
did
not
intend
to
lift
his
hat
but
timing
the
gesture
properly
would
in
fact
actually
rub
his
forehead
these
were
the
hasty
plans
which
occupied
his
thoughts
until
he
was
within
about
fifty
feet
of
her
when
he
ceased
to
have
either
plans
or
thoughts
he
had
kept
his
eyes
from
looking
full
at
her
until
then
and
as
he
saw
her
thus
close
at
hand
and
coming
nearer
a
regret
that
was
dumfounding
took
possession
of
him
for
the
first
time
he
had
the
sense
of
having
lost
something
of
overwhelming
importance
lucy
did
not
keep
to
the
right
but
came
straight
to
meet
him
smiling
and
with
her
hand
offered
to
him
why
you
he
stammered
as
he
took
it
have
you
what
he
meant
to
say
was
have
you
heard
have
i
what
she
asked
and
he
saw
that
eugene
had
not
yet
told
her
nothing
he
gasped
may
i
may
i
turn
and
walk
with
you
a
little
way
yes
indeed
she
said
cordially
he
would
not
have
altered
what
had
been
done
he
was
satisfied
with
all
that
satisfied
that
it
was
right
and
that
his
own
course
was
right
but
he
began
to
perceive
a
striking
inaccuracy
in
some
remarks
he
had
made
to
his
mother
now
when
he
had
put
matters
in
such
shape
that
even
by
the
relinquishment
of
his
ideals
of
life
he
could
not
have
lucy
knew
that
he
could
never
have
her
and
knew
that
when
eugene
told
her
the
history
of
yesterday
he
could
not
have
a
glance
or
word
even
friendly
from
her
now
when
he
must
in
good
truth
give
up
all
idea
of
lucy
he
was
amazed
that
he
could
have
used
such
words
as
no
particular
sacrifice
and
believed
them
when
he
said
them
she
had
looked
never
in
his
life
so
bewitchingly
pretty
as
she
did
today
and
as
he
walked
beside
her
he
was
sure
that
she
was
the
most
exquisite
thing
in
the
world
lucy
he
said
huskily
i
want
to
tell
you
something
something
that
i
hope
it
a
lively
something
then
she
said
and
laughed
been
so
glum
he
scarcely
spoken
to
me
your
uncle
george
amberson
came
to
see
him
an
hour
ago
and
they
shut
themselves
up
in
the
library
and
your
uncle
looked
as
glum
as
papa
i
be
glad
if
tell
me
a
funny
story
well
it
may
seem
one
to
you
he
said
bitterly
just
to
begin
with
when
you
went
away
you
did
let
me
know
not
even
a
word
not
a
line
her
manner
persisted
in
being
inconsequent
why
no
she
said
i
just
trotted
off
for
some
well
at
least
you
might
have
why
no
she
said
again
briskly
do
you
remember
george
we
had
a
grand
quarrel
and
did
speak
to
each
other
all
the
way
home
from
a
long
long
drive
so
as
we
could
play
together
like
good
children
of
course
it
was
plain
that
we
ought
to
play
at
play
he
cried
yes
what
i
mean
is
that
we
come
to
the
point
where
it
was
time
to
quit
playing
well
what
we
were
at
being
lovers
you
mean
do
you
something
like
that
she
said
lightly
for
us
two
playing
at
being
lovers
was
just
the
same
as
playing
at
i
had
all
the
purposes
and
that
gave
you
all
the
crossness
things
were
getting
along
at
all
it
was
absurd
well
have
it
your
own
way
he
said
it
need
have
been
no
it
could
help
but
be
she
informed
him
cheerfully
the
way
i
am
and
the
way
you
are
it
could
ever
be
anything
else
so
what
was
the
use
i
do
know
he
sighed
and
his
sigh
was
abysmal
but
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
is
this
when
you
went
away
you
did
let
me
know
and
did
care
how
or
when
i
heard
it
but
i
not
like
that
with
you
this
time
i
going
away
that
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
going
away
tomorrow
night
she
nodded
sunnily
that
nice
for
you
i
hope
you
have
ever
so
jolly
a
time
i
do
expect
to
have
a
particularly
jolly
well
then
she
laughed
if
i
were
you
i
do
think
i
it
seemed
impossible
to
impress
this
distracting
creature
to
make
her
serious
lucy
he
said
desperately
this
is
our
last
walk
evidently
she
said
if
you
going
away
tomorrow
lucy
this
may
be
the
last
time
i
see
you
ever
ever
in
my
at
that
she
looked
at
him
quickly
across
her
shoulder
but
she
smiled
as
brightly
as
before
and
with
the
same
cordial
inconsequence
oh
i
can
hardly
think
that
she
said
and
of
course
i
be
awfully
sorry
to
think
it
you
not
moving
away
are
you
to
live
and
even
if
you
were
of
course
you
be
coming
back
to
visit
your
relatives
every
now
and
i
do
know
when
i
coming
back
mother
and
i
are
starting
night
for
a
trip
around
the
at
this
she
did
look
thoughtful
your
mother
is
going
with
you
good
heavens
he
groaned
lucy
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
that
i
am
going
at
this
her
cordial
smile
instantly
appeared
again
yes
of
course
she
said
i
sure
i
miss
you
ever
so
much
are
you
to
be
gone
long
he
stared
at
her
wanly
i
told
you
indefinitely
he
said
we
made
no
plans
at
all
for
coming
that
does
sound
like
a
long
trip
she
exclaimed
admiringly
do
you
plan
to
be
travelling
all
the
time
or
will
you
stay
in
some
one
place
the
greater
part
of
it
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
to
lucy
he
halted
and
she
stopped
with
him
they
had
come
to
a
corner
at
the
edge
of
the
business
section
of
the
city
and
people
were
everywhere
about
them
brushing
against
them
sometimes
in
passing
i
ca
stand
this
george
said
in
a
low
voice
i
just
about
ready
to
go
in
this
here
and
ask
the
clerk
for
something
to
keep
me
from
dying
in
my
tracks
it
quite
a
shock
you
see
lucy
what
is
to
find
out
certainly
at
last
how
deeply
you
cared
for
me
to
see
how
much
difference
this
makes
to
you
by
jove
i
have
mattered
to
you
her
cordial
smile
was
tempered
now
with
george
she
laughed
indulgently
surely
you
do
want
me
to
do
pathos
on
a
downtown
corner
you
would
pathos
anywhere
well
do
you
think
pathos
is
generally
rather
fooling
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
he
said
i
ca
lucy
he
took
her
hand
it
i
think
it
for
good
lucy
i
do
hope
you
have
the
most
splendid
she
gave
his
hand
a
cordial
little
grip
then
released
it
lightly
give
my
love
to
your
mother
he
turned
heavily
away
and
a
moment
later
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
she
had
not
gone
on
but
stood
watching
him
that
same
casual
cordial
smile
on
her
face
to
the
very
last
and
now
as
he
looked
back
she
emphasized
her
friendly
unconcern
by
waving
her
small
hand
to
him
cheerily
though
perhaps
with
the
slightest
hint
of
preoccupation
as
if
she
had
begun
to
think
of
the
errand
that
brought
her
downtown
in
his
mind
george
had
already
explained
her
to
his
own
poignant
dissatisfaction
some
blond
pup
probably
whom
she
had
met
during
that
perfectly
gorgeous
time
and
he
strode
savagely
onward
not
looking
back
again
but
lucy
remained
where
she
was
until
he
was
out
of
sight
then
she
went
slowly
into
the
drugstore
which
had
struck
george
as
a
possible
source
of
stimulant
for
himself
please
let
me
have
a
few
drops
of
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
in
a
glass
of
water
she
said
with
the
utmost
composure
yes
said
the
impressionable
clerk
who
had
been
looking
at
her
through
the
display
window
as
she
stood
on
the
corner
but
a
moment
later
as
he
turned
from
the
shelves
of
glass
jars
against
the
wall
with
the
potion
she
had
asked
for
in
his
hand
he
uttered
an
exclamation
for
goshes
sake
miss
and
describing
this
adventure
to
his
that
evening
sagged
pretty
near
to
the
counter
she
was
he
said
if
i
had
been
a
bright
quick
young
fella
she
flummixed
plum
i
was
watchin
her
out
the
window
talkin
to
some
young
fella
and
she
was
all
right
then
she
was
all
right
when
she
come
in
the
store
too
yes
sir
the
prettiest
girl
that
ever
walked
in
our
place
and
took
one
good
look
at
me
i
reckon
it
must
be
the
truth
what
some
you
town
wags
say
about
my
face
chapter
xxviii
at
that
hour
the
heroine
of
the
susceptible
clerk
romance
was
engaged
in
brightening
the
rosy
little
coal
fire
under
the
white
mantelpiece
in
her
pretty
boudoir
four
photographs
all
framed
in
decorous
plain
silver
went
to
the
anthracite
fierce
destruction
frames
and
all
and
three
packets
of
letters
and
notes
in
a
charming
florentine
of
painted
wood
nor
was
the
box
any
more
than
the
silver
frames
spared
this
rousing
finish
thrown
heartily
upon
live
coal
the
fine
wood
sparkled
forth
in
stars
then
burst
into
an
alarming
blaze
which
scorched
the
white
mantelpiece
but
lucy
stood
and
looked
on
without
moving
it
was
not
eugene
who
told
her
what
had
happened
at
isabel
door
when
she
got
home
she
found
fanny
minafer
waiting
for
her
a
secret
excursion
of
fanny
for
the
purpose
presumably
of
letting
out
again
because
that
was
what
she
did
she
told
lucy
everything
except
her
own
lamentable
part
in
the
production
of
the
recent
miseries
and
concluded
with
a
tribute
to
george
the
worst
of
it
is
he
thinks
been
such
a
hero
and
isabel
does
too
and
that
makes
him
more
than
twice
as
awful
it
been
the
same
all
his
life
everything
he
did
was
noble
and
perfect
he
had
a
domineering
nature
to
begin
with
and
she
let
it
go
on
and
fostered
it
till
it
absolutely
ruled
her
i
never
saw
a
plainer
case
of
a
person
fault
making
them
pay
for
having
it
she
goes
about
overseeing
the
packing
and
praising
george
and
pretending
to
be
perfectly
cheerful
about
what
he
making
her
do
and
about
the
dreadful
things
he
done
she
pretends
he
did
such
a
fine
thing
so
manly
and
protective
going
to
johnson
and
so
heroic
doing
what
his
made
him
even
though
he
knew
what
it
would
cost
him
with
you
and
all
the
while
it
almost
killing
her
what
he
said
to
your
father
she
always
been
lofty
enough
so
to
speak
and
had
the
greatest
idea
of
the
ambersons
being
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
all
that
but
rudeness
or
anything
like
a
or
any
bad
manners
they
always
just
made
her
sick
but
she
could
never
see
what
george
manners
were
oh
it
been
a
terrible
adulation
it
going
to
be
a
task
for
me
living
in
that
big
house
all
alone
you
must
come
and
see
me
i
mean
after
they
gone
of
course
i
go
crazy
if
i
do
see
something
of
people
i
sure
you
come
as
often
as
you
can
i
know
you
too
well
to
think
you
be
sensitive
about
coming
there
or
being
reminded
of
george
thank
heaven
you
too
miss
fanny
concluded
with
a
profound
fervour
you
too
to
let
anything
affect
you
deeply
about
that
that
monkey
the
four
photographs
and
the
painted
florentine
box
went
to
their
cremation
within
the
same
hour
that
miss
fanny
spoke
and
a
little
later
lucy
called
her
father
in
as
he
passed
her
door
and
pointed
to
the
blackened
area
on
the
underside
of
the
mantelpiece
and
to
the
burnt
heap
upon
the
coal
where
some
metallic
shapes
still
retained
outline
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
in
passionate
sympathy
telling
him
that
she
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
and
presently
he
began
to
comfort
her
and
managed
an
embarrassed
laugh
well
well
he
said
i
was
too
old
for
such
foolishness
to
be
getting
into
my
head
no
no
she
sobbed
and
if
you
knew
how
i
despise
myself
for
for
ever
having
thought
one
instant
about
oh
miss
fanny
called
him
the
right
name
that
monkey
he
is
there
i
think
i
agree
with
you
eugene
said
grimly
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
steady
light
of
anger
that
was
to
last
yes
i
think
i
agree
with
you
about
that
there
only
one
thing
to
do
with
such
a
person
she
said
vehemently
that
to
put
him
out
of
our
thoughts
forever
forever
and
yet
the
next
day
at
six
which
was
the
hour
fanny
had
told
her
when
george
and
his
mother
were
to
leave
upon
their
long
journey
lucy
touched
that
scorched
place
on
her
mantel
with
her
hand
just
as
the
little
clock
above
it
struck
then
after
this
odd
unconscious
gesture
she
went
to
a
window
and
stood
between
the
curtains
looking
out
into
the
cold
november
dusk
and
in
spite
of
every
reasoning
and
reasonable
power
within
her
a
pain
of
loneliness
struck
through
her
heart
the
dim
street
below
her
window
the
dark
houses
across
the
way
the
vague
air
itself
all
looked
empty
and
cold
and
most
of
all
uninteresting
something
more
sombre
than
november
dusk
took
the
colour
from
them
and
gave
them
that
air
of
desertion
the
light
of
her
fire
flickering
up
behind
her
showed
suddenly
a
flying
group
of
tiny
snowflakes
nearing
the
and
for
an
instant
she
felt
the
sensation
of
being
dragged
through
a
snows
drift
under
a
broken
cutter
with
a
boy
arms
about
her
an
arrogant
handsome
boy
who
nevertheless
did
his
best
to
get
hurt
himself
keeping
her
from
any
possible
harm
she
shook
the
picture
out
of
her
eyes
indignantly
then
came
and
sat
before
her
fire
and
looked
long
and
long
at
the
blackened
mantelpiece
she
did
not
have
the
mantelpiece
repainted
and
since
she
did
not
might
as
well
have
kept
his
photographs
one
forgets
what
made
the
scar
upon
his
hand
but
not
what
made
the
scar
upon
his
wall
she
played
no
marche
funebre
upon
her
piano
even
though
romantic
lamentation
was
then
at
the
top
of
of
the
in
the
country
american
youth
having
recently
discovered
the
distinguished
congeniality
between
itself
and
this
deathless
bit
of
deathly
gloom
she
did
not
even
play
robin
adair
she
played
bedelia
and
all
the
new
for
she
was
her
father
housekeeper
and
rightly
looked
upon
the
office
as
being
the
same
as
that
of
his
therefore
it
was
her
affair
to
keep
both
house
and
heart
in
what
state
of
cheerfulness
might
be
contrived
she
made
him
go
out
more
than
ever
made
him
take
her
to
all
the
gayeties
of
that
winter
declining
to
go
herself
unless
he
took
her
and
though
eugene
danced
no
more
and
quoted
shakespeare
to
prove
all
lightfoot
caperings
beneath
the
dignity
of
his
age
she
broke
his
resolution
for
him
at
the
new
year
eve
assembly
and
half
coaxed
half
dragged
him
forth
upon
the
floor
and
made
him
dance
the
new
year
in
with
her
new
faces
appeared
at
the
dances
of
the
winter
new
faces
had
been
appearing
everywhere
for
that
matter
and
familiar
ones
were
disappearing
merged
in
the
increasing
crowd
or
gone
forever
and
missed
a
little
and
not
long
for
the
town
was
growing
and
changing
as
it
never
had
grown
and
changed
before
it
was
heaving
up
in
the
middle
incredibly
it
was
spreading
incredibly
and
as
it
heaved
and
spread
it
befouled
itself
and
darkened
its
sky
its
boundary
was
mere
shapelessness
on
the
run
a
raw
new
house
would
appear
on
a
country
road
four
or
five
others
would
presently
be
built
at
intervals
between
it
and
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
country
road
would
turn
into
an
asphalt
street
with
a
drugstore
and
a
frame
grocery
at
a
corner
then
bungalows
and
cottages
would
swiftly
speckle
the
open
green
spaces
and
a
farm
had
become
a
suburb
which
would
immediately
shoot
out
other
suburbs
into
the
country
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
join
itself
solidly
to
the
city
you
drove
between
pleasant
fields
and
woodland
groves
one
spring
day
and
in
the
autumn
passing
over
the
same
ground
you
were
warned
off
the
tracks
by
an
interurban
gonging
and
beheld
beyond
cement
sidewalks
just
dry
new
busy
moving
gasoline
and
electricity
were
performing
the
miracles
eugene
had
predicted
but
the
great
change
was
in
the
citizenry
itself
what
was
left
of
the
patriotic
generation
that
had
fought
the
civil
war
and
subsequently
controlled
politics
had
become
venerable
and
was
little
heeded
the
descendants
of
the
pioneers
and
early
settlers
were
merging
into
the
new
crowd
becoming
part
of
it
little
to
be
distinguished
from
it
what
happened
to
boston
and
to
broadway
happened
in
degree
to
the
midland
city
the
old
stock
became
less
and
less
typical
and
of
the
grown
people
who
called
the
place
home
less
than
a
third
had
been
born
in
it
there
was
a
german
quarter
there
was
a
jewish
quarter
there
was
a
negro
quarter
square
miles
of
it
called
bucktown
there
were
many
irish
neighbourhoods
and
there
were
large
settlements
of
italians
and
of
hungarians
and
of
rumanians
and
of
serbians
and
other
balkan
peoples
but
not
the
emigrants
themselves
were
the
almost
dominant
type
on
the
streets
downtown
that
type
was
the
emigrant
prosperous
offspring
descendant
of
the
emigrations
of
the
seventies
and
eighties
and
nineties
those
great
in
search
not
so
directly
of
freedom
and
democracy
as
of
more
money
for
the
same
labour
a
new
midlander
in
fact
a
new
american
was
beginning
dimly
to
emerge
a
new
spirit
of
citizenship
had
already
sharply
defined
itself
it
was
idealistic
and
its
ideals
were
expressed
in
the
new
kind
of
young
men
in
business
downtown
they
were
optimists
optimists
to
the
point
of
belligerence
their
motto
being
boost
do
knock
and
they
were
hustlers
believing
in
hustling
and
in
honesty
because
both
paid
they
loved
their
city
and
worked
for
it
with
a
plutonic
energy
which
was
always
ardently
vocal
they
were
viciously
governed
but
they
sometimes
went
so
far
to
struggle
for
better
government
on
account
of
the
helpful
effect
of
good
government
on
the
price
of
real
estate
and
betterment
generally
the
politicians
could
not
go
too
far
with
them
and
knew
it
the
idealists
planned
and
strove
and
shouted
that
their
city
should
become
a
better
better
and
better
city
and
what
they
meant
when
they
used
the
word
better
was
more
prosperous
and
the
core
of
their
idealism
was
this
the
more
prosperous
my
beloved
city
the
more
prosperous
beloved
i
they
had
one
supreme
theory
that
the
perfect
beauty
and
happiness
of
cities
and
of
human
life
was
to
be
brought
about
by
more
factories
they
had
a
mania
for
factories
there
was
nothing
they
would
not
do
to
cajole
a
factory
away
from
another
city
and
they
were
never
more
piteously
embittered
than
when
another
city
cajoled
one
away
from
them
what
they
meant
by
prosperity
was
credit
at
the
bank
but
in
exchange
for
this
credit
they
got
nothing
that
was
not
dirty
and
therefore
to
a
sane
mind
valueless
since
whatever
was
cleaned
was
dirty
again
before
the
cleaning
was
half
done
for
as
the
town
grew
it
grew
dirty
with
an
incredible
completeness
the
idealists
put
up
magnificent
business
buildings
and
boasted
of
them
but
the
buildings
were
begrimed
before
they
were
finished
they
boasted
of
their
libraries
of
their
monuments
and
statues
and
poured
soot
on
them
they
boasted
of
their
schools
but
the
schools
were
dirty
like
the
children
within
them
this
was
not
the
fault
of
the
children
or
their
mothers
it
was
the
fault
of
the
idealists
who
said
the
more
dirt
the
more
they
drew
patriotic
optimistic
breaths
of
the
flying
powdered
filth
of
the
streets
and
took
the
foul
and
heavy
smoke
with
gusto
into
the
profundities
of
their
lungs
boost
do
knock
they
said
and
every
year
or
so
they
boomed
a
great
week
when
everybody
was
supposed
to
get
rid
of
the
tin
cans
in
his
backyard
they
were
happiest
when
the
tearing
down
and
building
up
were
most
riotous
and
when
new
factory
districts
were
thundering
into
life
in
truth
the
city
came
to
be
like
the
body
of
a
great
dirty
man
skinned
to
show
his
busy
works
yet
wearing
a
few
barbaric
ornaments
and
such
a
figure
carved
coloured
and
discoloured
and
set
up
in
the
would
have
done
well
enough
as
the
god
of
the
new
people
such
a
god
they
had
indeed
made
in
their
own
image
as
all
peoples
make
the
god
they
truly
serve
though
of
course
certain
of
the
idealists
went
to
church
on
sunday
and
there
knelt
to
another
considered
to
be
impractical
in
business
but
while
the
growing
went
on
this
god
of
their
was
their
true
god
their
familiar
and
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
his
helplessly
obedient
slaves
nor
could
they
ever
hope
to
realize
their
serfdom
as
the
first
step
toward
becoming
free
men
until
they
should
make
the
strange
and
hard
discovery
that
matter
should
serve
man
spirit
prosperity
meant
good
credit
at
the
bank
black
lungs
and
purgatory
the
women
fought
the
dirt
all
they
could
but
if
they
let
the
air
into
their
houses
they
let
in
the
dirt
it
shortened
their
lives
and
kept
them
from
the
happiness
of
ever
seeing
anything
white
and
thus
as
the
city
grew
the
time
came
when
lucy
after
a
hard
struggle
had
to
give
up
her
curtains
and
her
white
walls
indoors
she
put
everything
into
dull
gray
and
brown
and
outside
had
the
little
house
painted
the
dark
green
nearest
to
black
then
she
knew
of
course
that
everything
was
as
dirty
as
ever
but
was
a
little
less
distressed
because
it
no
longer
looked
so
dirty
as
it
was
these
were
bad
times
for
amberson
addition
this
quarter
already
old
lay
within
a
mile
of
the
centre
of
the
town
but
business
moved
in
other
directions
and
the
addition
share
of
prosperity
was
only
the
smoke
and
dirt
with
the
bank
credit
left
out
the
owners
of
the
original
big
houses
sold
them
or
rented
them
to
keepers
and
the
tenants
of
the
multitude
of
small
houses
moved
farther
out
where
the
smoke
was
thinner
or
into
apartment
houses
which
were
built
by
dozens
now
cheaper
tenants
took
their
places
and
the
rents
were
lower
and
lower
and
the
houses
shabbier
and
shabbier
for
all
these
shabby
houses
burning
soft
coal
did
their
best
to
help
in
the
destruction
of
their
own
value
they
helped
to
make
the
quarter
so
dingy
and
the
air
so
foul
to
breathe
that
no
one
would
live
there
who
had
money
enough
to
get
farther
out
where
there
were
glimpses
of
ungrayed
sky
and
breaths
of
cleaner
winds
and
with
the
coming
of
the
new
speed
farther
out
was
now
as
close
to
business
as
the
addition
had
been
in
the
days
of
its
prosperity
distances
had
ceased
to
matter
the
five
new
houses
built
so
closely
where
had
been
the
fine
lawn
of
the
amberson
mansion
did
not
look
new
when
they
were
a
year
old
they
looked
as
old
as
they
would
ever
look
and
two
of
them
were
vacant
having
never
been
rented
for
the
major
mistake
about
apartment
houses
had
been
a
disastrous
one
he
guessed
wrong
george
amberson
he
guessed
wrong
at
just
the
wrong
time
housekeeping
in
a
house
is
harder
than
in
an
apartment
and
where
the
smoke
and
dirt
are
as
thick
as
they
are
in
the
addition
women
ca
stand
it
people
were
crazy
for
apartments
too
bad
he
could
have
seen
it
in
time
poor
man
he
digs
away
at
his
ledgers
by
his
old
gas
lamp
almost
every
night
he
still
refuses
to
let
the
mansion
be
torn
up
for
wiring
you
know
but
he
had
one
painful
satisfaction
this
spring
he
got
his
taxes
lowered
amberson
laughed
ruefully
and
fanny
minafer
asked
how
the
major
could
have
managed
such
an
economy
they
were
sitting
upon
the
veranda
at
isabel
one
evening
during
the
third
summer
of
the
absence
of
their
nephew
and
his
mother
and
the
conversation
had
turned
toward
amberson
finances
i
said
it
was
a
satisfaction
fanny
he
explained
the
property
has
gone
down
in
value
and
they
assessed
it
lower
than
they
did
fifteen
years
but
farther
out
oh
yes
out
prices
are
magnificent
out
and
farther
in
too
we
just
happen
to
be
the
wrong
spot
that
all
not
that
i
do
think
something
could
be
done
if
father
would
let
me
have
a
hand
but
he
wo
he
ca
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
he
done
his
own
figuring
he
says
and
it
his
lifelong
habit
to
keep
his
affairs
and
even
his
books
to
himself
and
just
hand
us
out
the
money
heaven
knows
he
done
enough
of
that
he
sighed
and
both
were
silent
looking
out
at
the
long
flares
of
the
constantly
passing
automobile
headlights
shifting
in
vast
geometric
demonstrations
against
the
darkness
now
and
then
a
bicycle
wound
its
nervous
way
among
these
portents
or
at
long
intervals
a
surrey
or
buggy
plodded
forlornly
by
there
seem
to
be
so
many
ways
of
making
money
nowadays
fanny
said
thoughtfully
every
day
i
hear
of
a
new
fortune
some
person
has
got
hold
of
one
way
or
another
nearly
always
it
somebody
you
never
heard
of
it
does
seem
all
to
be
in
just
making
motor
cars
i
hear
a
great
deal
in
manufacturing
these
things
that
motor
cars
use
new
inventions
particularly
i
met
dear
old
frank
bronson
the
other
day
and
he
told
me
oh
yes
even
dear
old
frank
got
the
fever
amberson
laughed
as
wild
as
any
of
them
he
told
me
about
this
invention
he
gone
into
too
in
it
some
new
electric
headlight
better
than
anything
yet
car
in
america
ca
help
but
have
and
all
that
putting
half
he
laid
by
into
it
and
the
fact
is
he
almost
talked
me
into
getting
father
to
me
enough
for
me
to
go
into
it
poor
father
he
financed
me
before
i
suppose
he
would
again
if
i
had
the
heart
to
ask
him
and
this
seems
to
be
a
good
thing
though
probably
old
frank
is
a
little
too
sanguine
at
any
rate
i
been
thinking
it
so
have
i
fanny
admitted
he
seemed
to
be
certain
it
would
pay
per
cent
the
first
year
and
enormously
more
after
that
and
i
only
getting
four
on
my
little
principal
people
are
making
such
enormous
fortunes
out
of
everything
to
do
with
motor
cars
it
does
seem
as
if
she
paused
well
i
told
him
i
think
it
over
we
may
turn
out
to
be
partners
and
millionaires
then
amberson
laughed
i
thought
i
ask
eugene
i
wish
you
would
said
fanny
he
probably
knows
exactly
how
much
profit
there
would
be
in
eugene
advice
was
to
go
slow
he
thought
electric
lights
for
automobiles
were
coming
someday
but
probably
not
until
certain
difficulties
could
be
altogether
he
was
discouraging
but
by
this
time
his
two
friends
had
the
fever
as
thoroughly
as
old
frank
bronson
himself
had
it
for
they
had
been
with
bronson
to
see
the
light
working
beautifully
in
a
machine
shop
they
were
already
enthusiastic
and
after
asking
eugene
opinion
they
argued
with
him
telling
him
how
they
had
seen
with
their
own
eyes
that
the
difficulties
he
mentioned
had
been
overcome
perfectly
fanny
cried
and
if
it
worked
in
the
shop
it
bound
to
work
any
place
else
is
it
he
would
not
agree
that
it
was
bound
to
yet
being
pressed
was
driven
to
admit
that
it
might
and
retiring
from
what
was
developing
into
an
oratorical
contest
repeated
a
warning
about
not
putting
too
much
into
george
amberson
also
laid
stress
on
this
caution
later
though
the
major
had
financed
him
again
and
he
was
going
you
must
be
careful
to
leave
yourself
a
of
safety
fanny
he
said
i
confident
that
is
a
pretty
conservative
investment
of
its
kind
and
all
the
chances
are
with
us
but
you
must
be
careful
to
leave
yourself
enough
to
fall
back
on
in
case
anything
should
go
fanny
deceived
him
in
the
impossible
event
of
anything
going
wrong
she
would
have
enough
left
to
live
on
she
declared
and
laughed
excitedly
for
she
was
having
the
best
time
that
had
come
to
her
since
wilbur
death
like
so
many
women
for
whom
money
has
always
been
provided
without
their
understanding
how
she
was
prepared
to
be
a
thorough
and
irresponsible
plunger
amberson
in
his
wearier
way
shared
her
excitement
and
in
the
winter
when
the
exploiting
company
had
been
formed
and
he
brought
fanny
her
importantly
engraved
shares
of
stock
he
reverted
to
his
prediction
of
possibilities
made
when
they
first
spoke
of
the
new
light
we
seem
to
be
partners
all
right
he
laughed
now
let
go
ahead
and
be
millionaires
before
isabel
and
young
george
come
when
they
come
home
she
echoed
sorrowfully
and
it
was
a
phrase
which
found
an
evasive
echo
in
isabel
letters
in
these
letters
isabel
was
always
planning
pleasant
things
that
she
and
fanny
and
the
major
and
george
and
brother
george
would
do
when
she
and
her
son
came
home
they
find
things
pretty
changed
i
afraid
fanny
said
if
they
ever
do
come
home
amberson
went
over
the
next
summer
and
joined
his
sister
and
nephew
in
paris
where
they
were
living
isabel
does
want
to
come
home
he
told
fanny
gravely
on
the
day
of
his
return
in
october
she
wanted
to
for
a
long
while
and
she
ought
to
come
while
she
can
stand
the
journey
and
he
amplified
this
statement
leaving
fanny
looking
startled
and
solemn
when
lucy
came
by
to
drive
him
out
to
dinner
at
the
new
house
eugene
had
just
completed
this
was
no
cottage
but
a
great
georgian
picture
in
brick
five
miles
north
of
amberson
addition
with
four
acres
of
its
own
hedged
land
between
it
and
its
next
neighbour
and
amberson
laughed
wistfully
as
they
turned
in
between
the
stone
and
brick
gate
pillars
and
rolled
up
the
crushed
stone
driveway
i
wonder
lucy
if
going
on
forever
repeating
itself
he
said
i
wonder
if
this
going
on
building
up
things
and
rolling
over
them
as
poor
father
once
said
it
was
rolling
over
his
poor
old
heart
it
looks
like
it
the
amberson
mansion
again
only
it
georgian
instead
of
nondescript
romanesque
but
it
just
the
same
amberson
mansion
that
my
father
built
long
before
you
were
born
the
only
difference
is
that
it
your
father
who
built
this
one
now
it
all
the
same
in
the
long
lucy
did
not
quite
understand
but
she
laughed
as
a
friend
should
and
taking
his
arm
showed
him
through
vast
rooms
where
walls
and
trim
window
hangings
were
reflected
dimly
in
dark
rugless
floors
and
the
sparse
furniture
showed
that
lucy
had
been
collecting
with
a
long
purse
by
jove
he
said
you
have
been
going
it
fanny
tells
me
you
had
a
great
dance
and
you
keep
right
on
being
the
belle
of
the
ball
not
any
than
you
used
to
be
fred
kinney
father
says
you
refused
fred
so
often
that
he
got
engaged
to
janie
sharon
just
to
prove
that
someone
would
have
him
in
spite
of
his
hair
well
the
material
world
do
move
and
you
got
the
new
kind
of
house
it
moves
into
nowadays
if
it
has
the
new
price
and
even
the
grand
old
expanses
of
plate
glass
we
used
to
be
so
proud
of
at
the
other
amberson
mansion
they
gone
too
with
the
crowded
heavy
gold
and
red
stuff
curious
we
still
got
the
plate
glass
windows
though
all
we
can
see
out
of
is
the
smoke
and
the
old
johnson
house
which
is
a
boardinghouse
now
while
you
got
a
view
and
you
cut
it
all
up
into
little
panes
well
you
pretty
refreshingly
out
of
the
smoke
up
yes
for
a
while
lucy
laughed
until
it
comes
and
we
have
to
move
out
no
you
stay
here
he
assured
her
it
will
be
somebody
else
move
out
he
continued
to
talk
of
the
house
after
eugene
arrived
and
gave
them
no
account
of
his
journey
until
they
had
retired
from
the
dinner
table
to
eugene
library
a
gray
and
shadowy
room
where
their
coffee
was
brought
then
equipped
with
a
cigar
which
seemed
to
occupy
his
attention
amberson
spoke
in
a
casual
tone
of
his
sister
and
her
son
i
found
isabel
as
well
as
usual
he
said
only
i
afraid
is
particularly
well
sydney
and
amelia
had
been
up
to
paris
in
the
spring
but
she
had
seen
them
somebody
told
her
they
were
there
it
seems
they
left
florence
and
were
living
in
rome
amelia
become
a
catholic
and
is
said
to
give
great
sums
to
charity
and
to
go
about
with
the
gentry
in
consequence
but
sydney
ailing
and
lives
in
a
most
of
the
time
it
struck
me
isabel
ought
to
be
doing
the
same
he
paused
bestowing
minute
care
upon
the
removal
of
the
little
band
from
his
cigar
and
as
he
seemed
to
have
concluded
his
narrative
eugene
spoke
out
of
the
shadow
beyond
a
heavily
shaded
lamp
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
asked
quietly
oh
she
cheerful
enough
said
amberson
still
not
looking
at
either
his
young
hostess
or
her
father
at
least
he
added
she
manages
to
seem
so
i
afraid
she
has
been
really
well
for
several
years
she
is
stout
you
know
she
has
changed
in
looks
much
and
she
seems
rather
alarmingly
short
of
breath
for
a
slender
person
father
been
that
way
for
years
of
course
but
never
nearly
so
much
as
isabel
is
now
of
course
she
makes
nothing
of
it
but
it
seemed
rather
serious
to
me
when
i
noticed
she
had
to
stop
and
rest
twice
to
get
up
the
one
short
flight
of
stairs
in
their
apartment
i
told
her
i
thought
she
ought
to
make
george
let
her
come
let
her
eugene
repeated
in
a
low
voice
does
she
want
to
she
does
urge
it
george
seems
to
like
the
life
his
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
way
and
of
course
she
never
change
about
being
proud
of
him
and
all
that
he
quite
a
swell
but
in
spite
of
anything
she
said
rather
than
because
i
know
she
does
indeed
want
to
come
she
like
to
be
with
father
of
course
and
i
think
she
well
she
intimated
one
day
that
she
feared
it
might
even
happen
that
she
get
to
see
him
again
at
the
time
i
thought
she
referred
to
his
age
and
feebleness
but
on
the
boat
coming
home
i
remembered
the
little
look
of
wistfulness
yet
of
resignation
with
which
she
said
it
and
it
struck
me
all
at
once
that
i
been
mistaken
i
saw
she
was
really
thinking
of
her
own
state
of
i
see
eugene
said
his
voice
even
lower
than
it
had
been
before
and
you
say
he
wo
her
come
home
amberson
laughed
but
still
continued
to
be
interested
in
his
cigar
oh
i
do
think
he
uses
force
he
very
gentle
with
her
i
doubt
if
the
subject
is
mentioned
between
them
and
yet
and
yet
knowing
my
interesting
nephew
as
you
do
would
you
think
that
was
about
the
way
to
put
it
knowing
him
as
i
do
yes
said
eugene
slowly
yes
i
should
think
that
was
about
the
way
to
put
a
murmur
out
of
the
shadows
beyond
him
a
faint
sound
musical
and
feminine
yet
expressive
of
a
notable
intensity
seemed
to
indicate
that
lucy
was
of
the
same
opinion
chapter
xxix
let
her
was
correct
but
the
time
came
and
it
came
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
when
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
george
letting
his
mother
come
home
he
had
to
bring
her
and
to
bring
her
quickly
if
she
was
to
see
her
father
again
and
amberson
had
been
right
her
danger
of
never
seeing
him
again
lay
not
in
the
major
feebleness
of
heart
but
in
her
own
as
it
was
george
telegraphed
his
uncle
to
have
a
wheeled
chair
at
the
station
for
the
journey
had
been
disastrous
and
to
this
hybrid
vehicle
placed
close
to
the
platform
her
son
carried
her
in
his
arms
when
she
arrived
she
was
unable
to
speak
but
patted
her
brother
and
fanny
hands
and
looked
very
sweet
fanny
found
the
desperate
courage
to
tell
her
she
was
lifted
from
the
chair
into
a
carriage
and
seemed
a
little
stronger
as
they
drove
home
for
once
she
took
her
hand
from
george
and
waved
it
feebly
toward
the
carriage
window
changed
she
whispered
so
you
mean
the
town
amberson
said
you
mean
the
old
place
is
changed
do
you
dear
she
smiled
and
moved
her
lips
it
change
to
a
happier
place
old
dear
he
said
now
that
back
in
it
and
going
to
get
well
but
she
only
looked
at
him
wistfully
her
eyes
a
little
frightened
when
the
carriage
stopped
her
son
carried
her
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
where
a
nurse
was
waiting
and
he
came
out
a
moment
later
as
the
doctor
went
in
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
stricken
group
was
clustered
amberson
and
fanny
and
the
major
george
deathly
pale
and
speechless
took
his
grandfather
hand
but
the
old
gentleman
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
action
when
are
they
going
to
let
me
see
my
daughter
he
asked
querulously
they
told
me
to
keep
out
of
the
way
while
they
carried
her
in
because
it
might
upset
her
i
wish
they
let
me
go
in
and
speak
to
my
daughter
i
think
she
wants
to
see
he
was
right
presently
the
doctor
came
out
and
beckoned
to
him
and
the
major
shuffled
forward
leaning
on
a
shaking
cane
his
figure
after
all
its
years
of
proud
soldierliness
had
grown
stooping
at
last
and
his
untrimmed
white
hair
straggled
over
the
back
of
his
collar
he
looked
old
old
and
divested
of
the
world
as
he
crept
toward
his
room
her
voice
was
stronger
for
the
waiting
group
heard
a
low
cry
of
tenderness
and
welcome
as
the
old
man
reached
the
open
doorway
then
the
door
was
closed
fanny
touched
her
nephew
arm
george
you
must
need
something
to
eat
i
know
she
want
you
to
i
had
things
ready
i
knew
she
want
me
to
you
better
go
down
to
the
dining
room
there
plenty
on
the
table
waiting
for
you
she
want
you
to
eat
he
turned
a
ghastly
face
to
her
it
was
so
i
want
anything
to
eat
he
said
savagely
and
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
taking
care
not
to
go
near
isabel
door
and
that
his
footsteps
were
muffled
by
the
long
thick
hall
rug
after
a
while
he
went
to
where
amberson
with
folded
arms
and
bowed
head
had
seated
himself
near
the
front
window
uncle
george
he
said
hoarsely
i
did
well
oh
my
god
i
did
think
this
thing
the
matter
with
her
could
ever
be
serious
i
he
gasped
when
that
doctor
i
had
meet
us
at
the
boat
he
could
not
go
on
amberson
only
nodded
his
head
and
did
not
otherwise
change
his
attitude
isabel
lived
through
the
night
at
eleven
fanny
came
timidly
to
george
in
his
room
eugene
is
here
she
whispered
he
downstairs
he
wants
she
gulped
he
wants
to
know
if
he
ca
see
her
i
know
what
to
say
i
said
i
see
i
did
know
the
doctor
said
the
doctor
said
we
keep
her
peaceful
george
said
sharply
do
you
think
that
man
coming
would
be
very
soothing
my
god
if
it
been
for
him
this
might
have
happened
we
could
have
gone
on
living
here
quietly
and
why
it
would
be
like
taking
a
stranger
into
her
room
she
has
even
spoken
of
him
more
than
twice
in
all
the
time
we
been
away
does
he
know
how
sick
she
is
you
tell
him
the
doctor
said
she
had
to
be
quiet
and
peaceful
that
what
he
did
say
is
it
fanny
acquiesced
tearfully
i
tell
him
i
tell
him
the
doctor
said
she
was
to
be
kept
very
quiet
i
i
did
know
and
she
pottered
out
an
hour
later
the
nurse
appeared
in
george
doorway
she
came
noiselessly
and
his
back
was
toward
her
but
he
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
his
jaw
fell
he
so
feared
what
she
was
going
to
say
she
wants
to
see
the
terrified
mouth
shut
with
a
click
and
he
nodded
and
followed
her
but
she
remained
outside
his
mother
room
while
he
went
in
isabel
eyes
were
closed
and
she
did
not
open
them
or
move
her
head
but
she
smiled
and
edged
her
hand
toward
him
as
he
sat
on
a
stool
beside
the
bed
he
took
that
slender
cold
hand
and
put
it
to
his
cheek
darling
did
you
get
something
to
eat
she
could
only
whisper
slowly
and
with
difficulty
it
was
as
if
isabel
herself
were
far
away
and
only
able
to
signal
what
she
wanted
to
say
yes
all
you
needed
yes
she
did
not
speak
again
for
a
time
then
are
you
sure
you
did
did
catch
cold
coming
home
i
all
right
that
good
it
sweet
it
sweet
what
is
mother
darling
to
feel
my
hand
on
your
cheek
i
i
can
feel
but
this
frightened
him
horribly
that
she
seemed
so
glad
she
could
feel
it
like
a
child
proud
of
some
miraculous
seeming
thing
accomplished
it
frightened
him
so
that
he
could
not
speak
and
he
feared
that
she
would
know
how
he
trembled
but
she
was
unaware
and
again
was
silent
finally
she
spoke
again
i
wonder
if
if
eugene
and
lucy
know
that
we
come
i
sure
they
has
he
asked
about
me
yes
he
was
has
he
gone
yes
she
sighed
faintly
i
like
what
mother
i
like
to
have
seen
it
was
just
audible
this
little
regretful
murmur
several
minutes
passed
before
there
was
another
just
just
once
she
whispered
and
then
was
still
she
seemed
to
have
fallen
asleep
and
george
moved
to
go
but
a
faint
pressure
upon
his
fingers
detained
him
and
he
remained
with
her
hand
still
pressed
against
his
cheek
after
a
while
he
made
sure
she
was
asleep
and
moved
again
to
let
the
nurse
come
in
and
this
time
there
was
no
pressure
of
the
fingers
to
keep
him
she
was
not
asleep
but
thinking
that
if
he
went
he
might
get
some
rest
and
be
better
prepared
for
what
she
knew
was
coming
she
commanded
those
longing
fingers
of
hers
and
let
him
go
he
found
the
doctor
standing
with
the
nurse
in
the
hall
and
telling
them
that
his
mother
was
drowsing
now
george
went
back
to
his
own
room
where
he
was
startled
to
find
his
grandfather
lying
on
the
bed
and
his
uncle
leaning
against
the
wall
they
had
gone
home
two
hours
before
and
he
did
not
know
they
had
returned
the
doctor
thought
we
better
come
over
amberson
said
then
was
silent
and
george
shaking
violently
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
his
shaking
continued
and
from
time
to
time
he
wiped
heavy
sweat
from
his
forehead
the
hours
passed
and
sometimes
the
old
man
upon
the
bed
would
snore
a
little
stop
suddenly
and
move
as
if
to
rise
but
george
amberson
would
set
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
murmur
a
reassuring
word
or
two
now
and
then
either
uncle
or
nephew
would
tiptoe
into
the
hall
and
look
toward
isabel
room
then
come
tiptoeing
back
the
other
watching
him
haggardly
once
george
gasped
defiantly
that
doctor
in
new
york
said
she
might
get
better
do
you
know
he
did
do
you
know
he
said
she
might
amberson
made
no
answer
dawn
had
been
murking
through
the
smoky
windows
growing
stronger
for
half
an
hour
when
both
men
started
violently
at
a
sound
in
the
hall
and
the
major
sat
up
on
the
bed
unchecked
it
was
the
voice
of
the
nurse
speaking
to
fanny
minafer
and
the
next
moment
fanny
appeared
in
the
doorway
making
contorted
efforts
to
speak
amberson
said
weakly
does
she
want
us
to
come
in
but
fanny
found
her
voice
and
uttered
a
long
loud
cry
she
threw
her
arms
about
george
and
sobbed
in
an
agony
of
loss
and
compassion
she
loved
you
she
wailed
she
loved
you
she
loved
you
oh
how
she
did
love
you
isabel
had
just
left
them
chapter
xxx
major
amberson
remained
through
the
time
that
followed
he
knew
that
this
separation
from
his
daughter
would
be
short
that
the
separation
which
had
preceded
it
was
the
long
one
he
worked
at
his
ledgers
no
more
under
his
old
gas
but
would
sit
all
evening
staring
into
the
fire
in
his
bedroom
and
not
speaking
unless
someone
asked
him
a
question
he
seemed
almost
unaware
of
what
went
on
around
him
and
those
who
were
with
him
thought
him
dazed
by
isabel
death
guessing
that
he
was
lost
in
reminiscences
and
vague
dreams
probably
his
mind
is
full
of
pictures
of
his
youth
or
the
civil
war
and
the
days
when
he
and
mother
were
young
married
people
and
all
of
us
children
were
jolly
little
things
and
the
city
was
a
small
town
with
one
cobbled
street
and
the
others
just
dirt
roads
with
board
this
was
george
amberson
conjecture
and
the
others
agreed
but
they
were
mistaken
the
major
was
engaged
in
the
profoundest
thinking
of
his
life
no
business
plans
which
had
ever
absorbed
him
could
compare
in
momentousness
with
the
plans
that
absorbed
him
now
for
he
had
to
plan
how
to
enter
the
unknown
country
where
he
was
not
even
sure
of
being
recognized
as
an
amberson
not
sure
of
anything
except
that
isabel
would
help
him
if
she
could
his
absorption
produced
the
outward
effect
of
reverie
but
of
course
it
was
not
the
major
was
occupied
with
the
first
really
important
matter
that
had
taken
his
attention
since
he
came
home
invalided
after
the
gettysburg
campaign
and
went
into
business
and
he
realized
that
everything
which
had
worried
him
or
delighted
him
during
this
lifetime
between
then
and
all
his
buying
and
building
and
trading
and
banking
that
it
all
was
trifling
and
waste
beside
what
concerned
him
now
he
seldom
went
out
of
his
room
and
often
left
untouched
the
meals
they
brought
to
him
there
and
this
neglect
caused
them
to
shake
their
heads
mournfully
again
mistaking
for
dazedness
the
profound
concentration
of
his
mind
meanwhile
the
life
of
the
little
bereft
group
still
forlornly
centering
upon
him
began
to
pick
up
again
as
life
will
and
to
emerge
from
its
own
period
of
dazedness
it
was
not
isabel
father
but
her
son
who
was
really
dazed
a
month
after
her
death
he
walked
abruptly
into
fanny
room
one
night
and
found
her
at
her
desk
eagerly
adding
columns
of
figures
with
which
she
had
covered
several
sheets
of
paper
this
mathematical
computation
was
concerned
with
her
future
income
to
be
produced
by
the
electric
headlight
now
just
placed
on
the
general
market
but
fanny
was
ashamed
to
be
discovered
doing
anything
except
mourning
and
hastily
pushed
the
sheets
aside
even
as
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
greet
her
visitor
george
you
startled
i
beg
your
pardon
for
not
knocking
he
said
huskily
i
did
she
turned
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
him
solicitously
sit
down
george
wo
you
no
i
just
wanted
i
could
hear
you
walking
up
and
down
in
your
room
said
fanny
you
were
doing
it
ever
since
dinner
and
it
seems
to
me
you
at
it
almost
every
evening
i
do
believe
it
good
for
you
and
i
know
it
would
worry
your
mother
terribly
if
she
fanny
hesitated
see
here
george
said
breathing
fast
i
want
to
tell
you
once
more
that
what
i
did
was
right
how
could
i
have
done
anything
else
but
what
i
did
do
about
what
george
about
everything
he
exclaimed
and
he
became
vehement
i
did
the
right
thing
i
tell
you
in
heaven
name
i
like
to
know
what
else
there
was
for
anybody
in
my
position
to
do
it
would
have
been
a
dreadful
thing
for
me
to
just
let
matters
go
on
and
not
interfere
it
would
have
been
terrible
what
else
on
earth
was
there
for
me
to
do
i
had
to
stop
that
talk
did
i
could
a
son
do
less
than
i
did
it
cost
me
something
to
do
it
lucy
and
i
had
a
quarrel
but
that
would
have
come
round
in
time
and
it
meant
the
end
forever
when
i
turned
her
father
back
from
our
door
i
knew
what
it
meant
yet
i
went
ahead
and
did
it
because
knew
it
had
to
be
done
if
the
talk
was
to
be
stopped
i
took
mother
away
for
the
same
reason
i
knew
that
would
help
to
stop
it
and
she
was
happy
over
there
she
was
perfectly
happy
i
tell
you
i
think
she
had
a
happy
life
and
that
my
only
consolation
she
did
live
to
be
old
she
was
still
beautiful
and
young
looking
and
i
feel
she
rather
have
gone
before
she
got
old
she
had
a
good
husband
and
all
the
comfort
and
luxury
that
anybody
could
have
and
how
could
it
be
called
anything
but
a
happy
life
she
was
always
cheerful
and
when
i
think
of
her
i
can
always
see
her
laughing
i
can
always
hear
that
pretty
laugh
of
hers
when
i
can
keep
my
mind
off
of
the
trip
home
and
that
last
night
i
always
think
of
her
gay
and
laughing
so
how
on
earth
could
she
have
had
anything
but
a
happy
life
people
that
happy
do
look
cheerful
all
the
time
do
they
they
look
unhappy
if
they
are
unhappy
that
how
they
look
see
here
he
faced
her
challengingly
do
you
deny
that
i
did
the
right
thing
oh
i
do
pretend
to
judge
fanny
said
soothingly
for
his
voice
and
gesture
both
partook
of
wildness
i
know
you
think
you
did
think
i
did
he
echoed
violently
my
god
in
heaven
and
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
what
else
was
there
to
do
what
choice
did
i
have
was
there
any
other
way
of
stopping
the
talk
he
stopped
close
in
front
of
her
gesticulating
his
voice
harsh
and
loud
do
you
hear
me
i
asking
you
was
there
any
other
way
on
earth
of
protecting
her
from
the
talk
miss
fanny
looked
away
it
died
down
before
long
i
think
she
said
nervously
that
shows
i
was
right
does
it
he
cried
if
i
had
acted
as
i
did
that
slanderous
old
johnson
woman
would
have
kept
on
with
her
slanders
she
still
be
no
fanny
interrupted
she
dead
she
dropped
dead
with
apoplexy
one
day
about
six
weeks
after
you
left
i
did
mention
it
in
my
letters
because
i
did
want
i
thought
well
the
other
people
would
have
kept
on
then
they
have
i
do
know
said
fanny
still
averting
her
troubled
eyes
things
are
so
changed
here
george
the
other
people
you
speak
of
one
hardly
knows
what
become
of
them
of
course
not
a
great
many
were
doing
the
talking
and
they
well
some
of
them
are
dead
and
some
might
as
well
be
you
never
see
them
any
more
and
the
rest
whoever
they
were
are
probably
so
mixed
in
with
the
crowds
of
new
people
that
seem
never
even
to
have
heard
of
us
and
i
sure
we
certainly
never
heard
of
them
and
people
seem
to
forget
things
so
soon
they
seem
to
forget
anything
you
ca
imagine
how
things
have
changed
here
george
gulped
painfully
before
he
could
speak
you
you
mean
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
if
i
just
let
things
go
on
oh
he
swung
away
walking
the
floor
again
i
tell
you
i
did
the
only
right
thing
if
you
do
think
so
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
ca
you
say
what
else
i
should
have
done
it
easy
enough
to
criticize
but
the
person
who
criticizes
a
man
ought
at
least
to
tell
him
what
else
he
should
have
done
you
think
i
was
wrong
i
not
saying
so
she
said
you
did
at
the
time
he
cried
you
said
enough
then
i
think
well
what
have
you
to
say
now
if
you
so
sure
i
was
wrong
nothing
it
only
because
you
afraid
to
he
said
and
he
went
on
with
a
sudden
bitter
divination
you
reproaching
yourself
with
what
you
had
to
do
with
all
that
and
you
trying
to
make
up
for
it
by
doing
and
saying
what
you
think
mother
would
want
you
to
and
you
think
i
stand
it
if
i
got
to
thinking
i
might
have
done
differently
oh
i
know
that
exactly
what
in
your
mind
you
do
think
i
was
wrong
so
does
uncle
george
i
challenged
him
about
it
the
other
day
and
he
answered
just
as
you
answering
evaded
and
tried
to
be
gentler
i
do
care
to
be
handled
with
gloves
i
tell
you
i
was
right
and
i
do
need
any
coddling
by
people
that
think
i
was
and
i
suppose
you
believe
i
was
wrong
not
to
let
morgan
see
her
that
last
night
when
he
came
here
and
she
she
was
dying
if
you
do
why
in
the
name
of
god
did
you
come
and
ask
me
you
could
have
taken
him
in
she
did
want
to
see
him
she
miss
fanny
looked
startled
you
think
she
told
me
so
and
the
tortured
young
man
choked
she
said
once
she
said
like
to
have
seen
him
just
once
she
meant
to
tell
him
that
what
she
meant
and
you
put
this
on
me
too
you
put
this
responsibility
on
me
but
i
tell
you
and
i
told
uncle
george
that
the
responsibility
is
all
mine
if
you
were
so
sure
i
was
wrong
all
the
time
when
i
took
her
away
and
when
i
turned
morgan
out
if
you
were
so
sure
what
did
you
let
me
do
it
for
you
and
uncle
george
were
grown
people
both
of
you
were
you
you
were
older
than
i
and
if
you
were
so
sure
you
were
wiser
than
i
why
did
you
just
stand
around
with
your
hands
hanging
down
and
let
me
go
ahead
you
could
have
stopped
it
if
it
was
wrong
could
you
fanny
shook
her
head
no
george
she
said
slowly
nobody
could
have
stopped
you
you
were
too
strong
and
and
what
he
demanded
loudly
and
she
loved
you
too
george
stared
at
her
hard
then
his
lower
lip
began
to
move
convulsively
and
he
set
his
teeth
upon
it
but
could
not
check
its
frantic
twitching
he
ran
out
of
the
room
she
sat
still
listening
he
had
plunged
into
his
mother
room
but
no
sound
came
to
fanny
ears
after
the
sharp
closing
of
the
door
and
presently
she
rose
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
but
could
hear
nothing
the
heavy
black
walnut
door
of
isabel
room
as
troubled
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
it
seemed
to
become
darker
and
vaguer
the
polished
wood
took
the
distant
ceiling
light
at
the
end
of
the
hall
in
dim
reflections
which
became
mysterious
and
to
disturbed
mind
the
single
sharp
point
of
light
on
the
bronze
was
like
a
continuous
sharp
cry
in
the
stillness
of
night
what
interview
was
sealed
away
from
human
eye
and
ear
within
the
lonely
darkness
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
in
that
darkness
where
own
special
chairs
were
and
her
own
special
books
and
the
two
great
walnut
wardrobes
filled
with
her
dresses
and
wraps
what
tragic
argument
might
be
there
vainly
striving
to
confute
the
gentle
dead
in
name
what
else
could
i
have
done
for
his
mother
immutable
silence
was
surely
answering
him
as
isabel
in
life
would
never
have
answered
him
and
he
was
beginning
to
understand
how
eloquent
the
dead
can
be
they
can
not
stop
their
eloquence
no
matter
how
they
have
loved
the
living
they
can
not
choose
and
so
no
matter
in
what
agony
george
should
cry
out
what
else
could
i
have
done
and
to
the
end
of
his
life
no
matter
how
often
he
made
that
wild
appeal
isabel
was
doomed
to
answer
him
with
the
wistful
faint
murmur
i
like
to
him
just
just
a
cheerful
darkey
went
by
the
house
loudly
and
tunelessly
whistling
some
broken
thoughts
upon
women
fried
food
and
gin
then
a
group
of
high
school
boys
returning
homeward
after
important
initiations
were
heard
skylarking
along
the
sidewalk
rattling
sticks
on
the
fences
squawking
hoarsely
and
even
attempting
to
sing
in
the
shocking
new
voices
of
uncompleted
adolescence
for
no
reason
and
just
as
a
poultry
yard
falls
into
causeless
agitation
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
and
for
half
an
hour
produced
the
effect
of
a
noisy
multitude
in
full
riot
to
the
woman
standing
upstairs
in
the
hall
this
was
almost
unbearable
and
she
felt
that
she
would
have
to
go
down
and
call
to
them
to
stop
but
she
was
too
timid
and
after
a
time
went
back
to
her
room
and
sat
at
her
desk
again
she
left
the
door
open
and
frequently
glanced
out
into
the
hall
but
gradually
became
once
more
absorbed
in
the
figures
which
represented
her
prospective
income
from
her
great
plunge
in
electric
lights
for
automobiles
she
did
not
hear
george
return
to
his
own
room
a
superstitious
person
might
have
thought
it
unfortunate
that
her
partner
in
this
speculative
industry
as
in
wilbur
disastrous
was
that
charming
but
too
haphazardous
man
of
the
world
george
amberson
he
was
one
of
those
optimists
who
believe
that
if
you
put
money
into
a
great
many
enterprises
one
of
them
is
sure
to
turn
out
a
fortune
and
therefore
in
order
to
find
the
lucky
one
it
is
only
necessary
to
go
into
a
large
enough
number
of
them
altogether
gallant
in
spirit
and
beautifully
game
under
catastrophe
he
had
gone
into
a
great
many
and
the
unanimity
of
their
bad
luck
as
he
called
it
gave
him
one
claim
to
be
a
distinguished
person
if
he
had
no
other
in
business
he
was
ill
fated
with
a
consistency
which
made
him
in
that
alone
a
remarkable
man
and
he
declared
with
some
earnestness
that
there
was
no
accounting
for
it
except
by
the
fact
that
there
had
been
so
much
good
luck
in
his
family
before
he
was
born
that
something
had
to
balance
it
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
my
record
and
stayed
out
he
told
fanny
one
day
the
next
spring
when
the
affairs
of
the
headlight
company
had
begun
to
look
discouraging
i
feel
the
old
familiar
sinking
attended
all
my
previous
efforts
to
prove
myself
a
business
genius
i
think
it
must
be
something
like
the
feeling
an
aeronaut
has
when
his
balloon
bursts
and
looking
down
he
sees
below
him
the
old
home
farm
where
he
used
to
live
i
mean
the
feeling
he
have
just
before
he
flattened
out
in
that
same
old
clay
barnyard
things
do
look
bleak
and
i
only
glad
you
did
go
into
this
confounded
thing
to
the
extent
i
miss
fanny
grew
pink
but
it
must
go
right
she
protested
we
saw
with
our
own
eyes
how
perfectly
it
worked
in
the
shop
the
light
was
so
bright
no
one
could
face
it
and
so
there
ca
be
any
reason
for
it
not
to
work
it
simply
oh
you
right
about
that
amberson
said
it
certainly
was
a
perfect
thing
in
the
shop
the
only
thing
we
did
know
was
how
fast
an
automobile
had
to
go
to
keep
the
light
going
it
appears
that
this
was
a
matter
of
some
well
how
fast
does
one
have
to
to
keep
the
light
from
going
entirely
out
he
informed
her
with
elaborate
deliberation
it
is
computed
by
those
enthusiasts
who
have
bought
our
product
and
subsequently
returned
it
to
us
and
got
their
money
back
they
compute
that
a
motor
car
must
maintain
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
or
else
there
wo
be
any
light
at
all
to
make
the
illumination
bright
enough
to
be
noticed
by
an
approaching
automobile
they
state
the
speed
must
be
more
than
thirty
miles
an
hour
at
objects
in
the
path
of
the
light
begin
to
become
visible
at
forty
they
are
revealed
distinctly
and
at
fifty
and
above
we
have
a
real
headlight
unfortunately
many
people
do
care
to
drive
that
fast
at
all
times
after
dusk
especially
in
the
traffic
or
where
policemen
are
likely
to
become
but
think
of
that
test
on
the
road
when
we
that
test
was
lovely
he
admitted
the
inventor
made
us
happy
with
his
oratory
and
you
and
frank
bronson
and
i
went
whirling
through
the
night
at
a
speed
that
thrilled
us
it
was
an
intoxicating
sensation
we
were
intoxicated
by
the
lights
the
lights
and
the
music
we
must
never
forget
that
drive
with
the
cool
wind
kissing
our
cheeks
and
the
road
lit
up
for
miles
ahead
we
must
never
forget
it
and
we
never
shall
it
cost
but
something
got
to
be
it
has
indeed
my
something
would
seem
to
be
leaving
my
watch
at
my
uncle
luckily
you
the
pink
of
fanny
cheeks
became
deeper
but
is
that
man
going
to
do
anything
to
remedy
it
ca
he
try
to
he
can
try
said
amberson
he
is
trying
in
fact
i
sat
in
the
shop
watching
him
try
for
several
beautiful
afternoons
while
outside
the
windows
all
nature
was
fragrant
with
spring
and
smoke
he
hums
ragtime
to
himself
as
he
tries
and
i
think
his
mind
is
wandering
to
something
else
less
tedious
to
some
new
invention
in
which
he
take
more
but
you
must
let
him
she
cried
you
must
make
him
keep
on
trying
oh
yes
he
understands
that
what
i
sit
there
for
i
keep
sitting
however
in
spite
of
the
time
he
spent
sitting
in
the
shop
worrying
the
inventor
of
the
fractious
light
amberson
found
opportunity
to
worry
himself
about
another
matter
of
business
this
was
the
settlement
of
isabel
estate
it
curious
about
the
deed
to
her
house
he
said
to
his
nephew
you
absolutely
sure
it
was
among
her
papers
mother
did
have
any
papers
george
told
him
none
at
all
all
she
ever
had
to
do
with
business
was
to
deposit
the
cheques
grandfather
gave
her
and
then
write
her
own
cheques
against
the
deed
to
the
house
was
never
recorded
amberson
said
thoughtfully
i
been
over
to
the
courthouse
to
see
i
asked
father
if
he
never
gave
her
one
and
he
did
seem
able
to
understand
me
at
first
then
he
finally
said
he
thought
he
must
have
given
her
a
deed
long
ago
but
he
was
sure
i
rather
think
he
never
did
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
get
him
to
execute
one
now
in
your
favour
i
speak
to
him
about
george
sighed
i
do
think
i
bother
him
about
it
the
house
is
mine
and
you
and
i
understand
that
it
is
that
enough
for
me
and
there
is
likely
to
be
much
trouble
between
you
and
me
when
we
come
to
settling
poor
grandfather
estate
i
just
been
with
him
and
i
think
it
would
only
confuse
him
for
you
to
speak
to
him
about
it
again
i
notice
he
seems
distressed
if
anybody
tries
to
get
his
attention
he
a
long
way
off
somewhere
and
he
likes
to
stay
that
way
i
think
i
think
mother
would
want
us
to
bother
him
about
it
i
sure
she
tell
us
to
let
him
alone
he
looks
so
white
and
amberson
shook
his
head
not
much
whiter
and
queerer
than
you
do
young
fellow
you
better
begin
to
get
some
air
and
exercise
and
quit
hanging
about
in
the
house
all
day
i
wo
bother
him
any
more
than
i
can
help
but
i
have
the
deed
made
out
ready
for
his
i
would
bother
him
at
all
i
do
see
you
might
see
said
his
uncle
uneasily
the
estate
is
just
about
as
involved
and
as
an
estate
can
well
get
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
i
have
helped
it
any
by
what
he
let
me
have
for
this
infernal
headlight
scheme
which
has
finally
gone
trolloping
forever
to
where
the
woodbine
twineth
leaves
me
flat
and
poor
old
frank
bronson
just
half
flat
and
fanny
well
thank
heaven
i
kept
her
from
going
in
so
deep
that
it
would
leave
her
flat
it
rough
on
her
as
it
is
i
suspect
you
ought
to
have
that
no
do
bother
i
bother
him
as
little
as
possible
i
wait
till
some
day
when
he
seems
to
brighten
up
a
but
amberson
waited
too
long
the
major
had
already
taken
eleven
months
since
his
daughter
death
to
think
important
things
out
he
had
got
as
far
with
them
as
he
could
and
there
was
nothing
to
detain
him
longer
in
the
world
one
evening
his
grandson
sat
with
him
the
major
seemed
to
like
best
to
have
young
george
with
him
so
far
as
they
were
able
to
guess
his
preferences
and
the
old
gentleman
made
a
queer
gesture
he
slapped
his
knee
as
if
he
had
made
a
sudden
discovery
or
else
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
something
george
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
inquiry
but
said
nothing
he
had
grown
to
be
almost
as
silent
as
his
grandfather
however
the
major
spoke
without
being
questioned
it
must
be
in
the
sun
he
said
there
was
anything
here
but
the
sun
in
the
first
place
and
the
earth
came
out
of
the
sun
and
we
came
out
of
the
earth
so
whatever
we
are
we
must
have
been
in
the
sun
we
go
back
to
the
earth
we
came
out
of
so
the
earth
will
go
back
to
the
sun
that
it
came
out
of
and
time
means
nothing
nothing
at
all
so
in
a
little
while
we
all
be
back
in
the
sun
together
i
wish
he
moved
his
hand
uncertainly
as
if
reaching
for
something
and
george
jumped
up
did
you
want
anything
grandfather
what
would
you
like
a
glass
of
water
no
no
no
i
do
want
the
reaching
hand
dropped
back
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
he
relapsed
into
silence
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
finished
the
sentence
he
had
begun
i
wish
somebody
could
tell
me
the
next
day
he
had
a
slight
cold
but
he
seemed
annoyed
when
his
son
suggested
calling
the
doctor
and
amberson
let
him
have
his
own
way
so
far
in
fact
that
after
he
had
got
up
and
dressed
the
following
morning
he
was
all
alone
when
he
went
away
to
find
out
what
he
been
able
to
think
out
all
those
things
he
had
wished
somebody
would
tell
him
old
sam
shuffling
in
with
the
breakfast
tray
found
the
major
in
his
accustomed
by
the
fireplace
and
yet
even
the
old
darkey
could
see
instantly
that
the
major
was
not
there
chapter
xxxi
when
the
great
amberson
estate
went
into
court
for
settlement
there
was
any
george
amberson
said
that
is
when
the
settlement
was
concluded
there
was
no
estate
i
guessed
it
amberson
went
on
as
an
expert
on
prosperity
my
career
is
disreputable
but
as
a
prophet
of
calamity
i
deserve
a
testimonial
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
not
having
long
ago
discovered
that
his
father
had
never
given
isabel
a
deed
to
her
house
and
those
pigs
sydney
and
amelia
he
added
for
this
was
another
thing
he
was
bitter
about
they
do
anything
i
sorry
i
gave
them
the
opportunity
of
making
a
polished
refusal
amelia
letter
was
about
half
in
italian
she
remember
enough
ways
of
saying
no
in
english
one
has
to
live
quite
a
long
while
to
realize
there
are
people
like
that
the
estate
was
badly
crippled
even
before
they
took
out
their
and
the
they
took
was
the
only
good
part
of
the
rotten
apple
well
i
did
ask
them
for
restitution
on
my
own
account
and
at
least
it
will
save
you
some
trouble
young
george
never
waste
any
time
writing
to
them
you
count
on
i
do
george
said
quietly
i
do
count
on
oh
we
not
feel
that
things
are
quite
desperate
amberson
laughed
but
not
with
great
cheerfulness
we
survive
georgie
you
will
especially
for
my
part
i
a
little
too
old
and
too
accustomed
to
fall
back
on
somebody
else
for
supplies
to
start
a
big
fight
with
life
i
be
content
with
just
surviving
and
i
can
do
it
on
an
consulship
an
can
always
be
pretty
sure
of
getting
some
such
job
and
i
hear
from
washington
the
matter
about
settled
i
live
pleasantly
enough
with
a
pitcher
of
ice
under
a
palm
tree
and
black
folks
to
wait
on
me
that
part
of
it
will
be
like
home
and
i
manage
to
send
you
fifty
dollars
every
now
and
then
after
i
once
get
settled
so
much
for
me
but
you
of
course
you
had
a
poor
training
for
making
your
own
way
but
you
only
a
boy
after
all
and
the
stuff
of
the
old
stock
is
in
you
it
come
out
and
do
something
i
never
forgive
myself
about
that
deed
it
would
have
given
you
something
substantial
to
start
with
still
you
have
a
little
tiny
bit
and
you
have
a
little
tiny
salary
too
and
of
course
your
aunt
fanny
here
and
she
got
something
you
can
fall
back
on
if
you
get
too
pinched
until
i
can
begin
to
send
you
a
dribble
now
and
george
little
tiny
bit
was
six
hundred
dollars
which
had
come
to
him
from
the
sale
of
his
mother
furniture
and
the
little
tiny
salary
was
eight
dollars
a
week
which
old
frank
bronson
was
to
pay
him
for
services
as
a
clerk
and
old
frank
would
have
offered
more
to
the
major
grandson
but
since
the
death
of
that
best
of
clients
and
his
own
experience
with
automobile
headlights
he
was
not
certain
of
being
able
to
pay
more
and
at
the
same
time
settle
his
own
small
bills
for
board
and
lodging
george
had
accepted
haughtily
and
thereby
removed
a
burden
from
his
uncle
mind
amberson
himself
however
had
not
even
a
tiny
bit
though
he
got
his
consular
appointment
and
to
take
him
to
his
post
he
found
it
necessary
to
borrow
two
hundred
of
his
nephew
six
hundred
dollars
it
makes
me
sick
george
he
said
but
i
better
get
there
and
get
that
salary
started
of
course
eugene
would
do
anything
in
the
world
and
the
fact
is
he
wanted
to
but
i
felt
that
ah
under
the
circumstances
never
george
exclaimed
growing
red
i
ca
imagine
one
of
the
family
he
paused
not
finding
it
necessary
to
explain
that
the
family
should
turn
a
man
from
the
door
and
then
accept
favours
from
him
i
wish
you
take
amberson
declined
one
thing
i
say
for
you
young
george
you
have
a
stingy
bone
in
your
body
that
the
amberson
stock
in
you
and
i
like
it
he
added
something
to
this
praise
of
his
nephew
on
the
day
he
left
for
washington
he
was
not
to
return
but
to
set
forth
from
the
capital
on
the
long
journey
to
his
post
george
went
with
him
to
the
station
and
their
farewell
was
lengthened
by
the
train
being
several
minutes
late
i
may
not
see
you
again
georgie
amberson
said
and
his
voice
was
a
little
husky
as
he
set
a
kind
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
quite
probable
that
from
this
time
on
we
only
know
each
other
by
letter
until
you
notified
as
my
next
of
kin
that
there
an
old
valise
to
be
forwarded
to
you
and
perhaps
some
dusty
curios
from
the
consulate
mantelpiece
well
it
an
odd
way
for
us
to
be
saying
one
would
have
thought
it
even
a
few
years
ago
but
here
we
are
two
gentlemen
of
elegant
appearance
in
a
state
of
bustitude
we
ca
ever
tell
what
will
happen
at
all
can
we
once
i
stood
where
we
standing
now
to
say
to
a
pretty
girl
only
it
was
in
the
old
station
before
this
was
built
and
we
called
it
the
been
visiting
your
mother
before
isabel
was
married
and
i
was
wild
about
her
and
she
admitted
she
did
mind
that
in
fact
we
decided
we
could
live
without
each
other
and
we
were
to
be
married
but
she
had
to
go
abroad
first
with
her
father
and
when
we
came
to
say
we
knew
we
would
see
each
other
again
for
almost
a
year
i
thought
i
could
live
through
it
and
she
stood
here
crying
well
i
do
even
know
where
she
lives
now
or
if
she
is
living
and
i
only
happen
to
think
of
her
sometimes
when
i
here
at
the
station
waiting
for
a
train
if
she
ever
thinks
of
me
she
probably
imagines
i
still
dancing
in
the
ballroom
at
the
amberson
mansion
and
she
probably
thinks
of
the
mansion
as
still
beautiful
still
the
finest
house
in
town
life
and
money
both
behave
like
loose
quicksilver
in
a
nest
of
cracks
and
when
they
gone
we
ca
tell
where
or
what
the
devil
we
did
with
but
i
believe
i
say
now
while
there
is
much
time
left
for
either
of
us
to
get
embarrassed
about
it
i
believe
i
say
that
i
always
been
fond
of
you
georgie
but
i
ca
say
that
i
always
liked
you
sometimes
felt
you
were
distinctly
not
an
acquired
taste
until
lately
one
had
to
be
fond
of
you
just
naturally
this
is
very
of
course
for
if
he
did
well
he
would
we
all
spoiled
you
terribly
when
you
were
a
little
boy
and
let
you
grow
up
en
prince
and
i
must
say
you
took
to
it
but
you
received
a
pretty
heavy
jolt
and
i
had
enough
of
your
disposition
myself
at
your
age
to
understand
a
little
of
what
cocksure
youth
has
to
go
through
inside
when
it
finds
that
it
can
make
terrible
mistakes
poor
old
fellow
you
get
both
kinds
of
jolts
together
spiritual
and
material
and
you
taken
them
pretty
quietly
and
well
with
my
train
coming
into
the
shed
you
forgive
me
for
saying
that
there
have
been
times
when
i
thought
you
ought
to
be
hanged
but
i
always
been
fond
of
you
and
now
i
like
you
and
just
for
a
last
word
there
may
be
somebody
else
in
this
town
who
always
felt
about
you
like
that
fond
of
you
i
mean
no
matter
how
much
it
seemed
you
ought
to
be
hanged
you
might
try
hello
i
must
run
send
back
the
money
as
fast
as
they
pay
me
so
and
god
bless
you
georgie
he
passed
through
the
gates
waved
his
hat
cheerily
from
the
other
side
of
the
iron
screen
and
was
lost
from
sight
in
the
hurrying
crowd
and
as
he
disappeared
an
unexpected
poignant
loneliness
fell
upon
his
nephew
so
heavily
and
so
suddenly
that
he
had
no
energy
to
recoil
from
the
shock
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
last
fragment
of
his
familiar
world
had
disappeared
leaving
him
all
alone
forever
he
walked
homeward
slowly
through
what
appeared
to
be
the
strange
streets
of
a
strange
city
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
city
was
strange
to
him
he
had
seen
little
of
it
during
his
years
in
college
and
then
had
followed
the
long
absence
and
his
tragic
return
since
that
he
had
been
scarcely
outdoors
at
all
as
fanny
complained
warning
him
that
his
health
would
suffer
and
he
had
been
downtown
only
in
a
closed
carriage
he
had
not
realized
the
great
change
the
streets
were
thunderous
a
vast
energy
heaved
under
the
universal
coating
of
dinginess
george
walked
through
the
begrimed
crowds
of
hurrying
strangers
and
saw
no
face
that
he
remembered
great
numbers
of
the
faces
were
even
of
a
kind
he
did
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
they
were
partly
like
the
old
type
that
his
boyhood
knew
and
partly
like
types
he
knew
abroad
he
saw
german
eyes
with
american
wrinkles
at
their
corners
he
saw
irish
eyes
and
neapolitan
eyes
roman
eyes
tuscan
eyes
eyes
of
lombardy
of
savoy
hungarian
eyes
balkan
eyes
scandinavian
eyes
all
with
a
queer
american
look
in
them
he
saw
jews
who
had
been
german
jews
jews
who
had
been
russian
jews
jews
who
had
been
polish
jews
but
were
no
longer
german
or
russian
or
polish
jews
all
the
people
were
soiled
by
the
through
which
they
hurried
under
the
heavy
sky
that
hung
close
upon
the
new
skyscrapers
and
nearly
all
seemed
harried
by
something
impending
though
here
and
there
a
women
with
bundles
would
be
laughing
to
a
companion
about
some
adventure
of
the
department
stores
or
perhaps
an
escape
from
the
charging
traffic
of
the
streets
and
not
infrequently
a
girl
or
a
young
matron
found
time
to
throw
an
encouraging
look
to
george
he
took
no
note
of
these
and
leaving
the
crowded
sidewalks
turned
north
into
national
avenue
and
presently
reached
the
quieter
but
no
less
begrimed
region
of
smaller
shops
and
houses
those
latter
had
been
the
homes
of
his
boyhood
playmates
old
friends
of
his
grandfather
had
lived
here
in
this
alley
he
had
fought
with
two
boys
at
the
same
time
and
whipped
them
in
that
front
yard
he
had
been
successfully
teased
into
temporary
insanity
by
class
of
pinky
little
girls
on
that
sagging
porch
a
laughing
woman
had
fed
him
and
other
boys
with
doughnuts
and
gingerbread
yonder
he
saw
the
staggered
relics
of
the
iron
picket
fence
he
had
made
his
white
pony
jump
on
a
dare
and
in
the
shabby
house
behind
the
fence
he
had
gone
to
children
parties
and
when
he
was
a
little
older
he
had
danced
there
often
and
fallen
in
love
with
mary
sharon
and
kissed
her
apparently
by
force
under
the
stairs
in
the
hall
the
double
front
doors
of
meaninglessly
carved
walnut
once
so
glossily
varnished
had
been
painted
smoke
gray
but
the
smoke
grime
showed
repulsively
even
on
the
smoke
gray
and
over
the
doors
a
smoked
sign
proclaimed
the
place
to
be
a
stag
other
houses
had
become
too
genteel
for
signs
but
many
were
franker
some
offering
board
by
the
day
week
or
meal
and
some
more
laconic
contenting
themselves
with
the
label
one
having
torn
out
part
of
an
old
bay
window
for
purposes
of
commercial
display
showed
forth
two
suspended
petticoats
and
a
pair
of
flannel
trousers
to
prove
the
claims
of
its
sign
french
cleaning
and
dye
its
next
neighbour
also
sported
a
remodelled
front
and
permitted
no
doubt
that
its
mission
in
life
was
to
attend
cosily
upon
death
j
rolsener
caskets
the
funeral
and
beyond
that
a
plain
old
honest
brick
house
was
flamboyantly
decorated
with
a
great
gilt
scroll
on
the
railing
of
the
veranda
mutual
order
cavaliers
and
dames
of
this
was
the
old
minafer
house
george
passed
it
without
perceptibly
wincing
in
fact
he
held
his
head
up
and
except
for
his
gravity
of
countenance
and
the
prison
pallor
he
had
acquired
by
too
constantly
remaining
indoors
there
was
little
to
warn
an
acquaintance
that
he
was
not
precisely
the
same
george
amberson
minafer
known
aforetime
he
was
still
so
magnificent
indeed
that
there
came
to
his
ears
a
waft
of
comment
from
a
passing
automobile
this
was
a
fearsome
red
car
glittering
in
brass
with
young
people
in
it
whose
motorism
had
reached
an
extreme
manifestation
in
dress
the
ladies
of
this
party
were
favourably
affected
at
sight
of
the
pedestrian
upon
the
sidewalk
and
as
the
machine
was
moving
slowly
and
close
to
the
curb
they
had
time
to
observe
him
in
detail
which
they
did
with
a
frankness
not
pleasing
to
the
object
of
their
attentions
one
sees
so
many
people
one
does
know
nowadays
said
the
youngest
of
the
young
ladies
this
old
town
of
ours
is
really
getting
enormous
i
should
mind
knowing
who
he
i
do
know
the
youth
beside
her
said
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
i
do
know
who
he
is
but
from
his
looks
i
know
who
he
thinks
he
is
he
thinks
he
the
grand
duke
cuthbert
there
was
a
burst
of
tittering
as
the
car
gathered
speed
and
rolled
away
with
the
girl
continuing
to
look
back
until
her
scandalized
companions
forced
her
to
turn
by
pulling
her
hood
over
her
face
she
made
an
impression
upon
george
so
deep
a
one
in
fact
that
he
unconsciously
put
his
emotion
into
a
muttered
word
riffraff
this
was
the
last
walk
home
he
was
ever
to
take
by
the
route
he
was
now
following
up
national
avenue
to
amberson
addition
and
the
two
big
old
houses
at
the
foot
of
amberson
boulevard
for
tonight
would
be
the
last
night
that
he
and
fanny
were
to
spend
in
the
house
which
the
major
had
forgotten
to
deed
to
isabel
they
were
to
move
out
and
george
was
to
begin
his
work
in
bronson
office
he
had
not
come
to
this
collapse
without
a
fierce
struggle
but
the
struggle
was
inward
and
the
rolling
world
was
not
agitated
by
it
and
rolled
calmly
on
for
of
all
the
ideals
of
life
which
the
world
in
its
rolling
inconsiderately
flattens
out
to
nothingness
the
least
likely
to
retain
a
profile
is
that
ideal
which
depends
upon
inheriting
money
george
amberson
in
spite
of
his
record
of
failures
in
business
had
spoken
shrewdly
when
he
realized
at
last
that
money
like
life
was
like
quicksilver
in
a
nest
of
and
his
nephew
had
the
awakening
experience
of
seeing
the
great
amberson
estate
vanishing
into
such
a
nest
in
a
twinkling
it
seemed
now
that
it
was
indeed
so
utterly
vanished
his
uncle
had
suggested
that
he
might
write
to
college
friends
perhaps
they
could
help
him
to
something
better
than
the
prospect
offered
by
bronson
office
but
george
flushed
and
shook
his
head
without
explaining
in
that
small
and
quietly
superior
crowd
of
his
he
had
too
emphatically
supported
the
ideal
of
being
rather
than
doing
he
could
not
appeal
to
one
of
its
members
now
to
help
him
to
a
job
besides
they
were
not
precisely
the
crew
in
the
world
and
he
had
long
ago
dropped
the
last
affectation
of
a
correspondence
with
any
of
them
he
was
as
aloof
from
any
survival
of
intimacy
with
his
boyhood
friends
in
the
city
and
in
truth
had
lost
track
of
most
of
them
the
friends
of
the
ace
once
bound
by
oath
to
succour
one
another
in
peril
or
poverty
were
long
ago
dispersed
one
or
two
had
died
one
or
two
had
gone
to
live
elsewhere
the
others
were
disappeared
into
the
smoky
bigness
of
the
heavy
city
of
the
brethren
there
remained
within
his
present
cognizance
only
his
old
enemy
the
kinney
now
married
to
janie
sharon
and
charlie
johnson
who
out
of
deference
to
his
mother
memory
had
passed
the
amberson
mansion
one
day
when
george
stood
upon
the
front
steps
and
looking
in
fiercely
had
looked
away
with
continued
fierceness
his
only
token
of
recognition
on
this
last
homeward
walk
of
his
when
george
reached
the
entrance
to
amberson
addition
that
is
when
he
came
to
where
the
entrance
had
formerly
been
he
gave
a
little
start
and
halted
for
a
moment
to
stare
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
noticed
that
the
stone
pillars
marking
the
entrance
had
been
removed
then
he
realized
that
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
queerness
about
this
corner
without
being
aware
of
what
made
the
difference
national
avenue
met
amberson
boulevard
here
at
an
obtuse
angle
and
the
removal
of
the
pillars
made
the
boulevard
seem
a
of
no
overpowering
importance
certainly
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
boulevard
at
the
next
corner
neptune
fountain
remained
and
one
could
still
determine
with
accuracy
what
its
designer
intentions
had
been
it
stood
in
sore
need
of
just
one
last
kindness
and
if
the
thing
had
possessed
any
friends
they
would
have
done
that
doleful
shovelling
after
dark
george
did
not
let
his
eyes
linger
upon
the
relic
nor
did
he
look
steadfastly
at
the
amberson
mansion
massive
as
the
old
house
was
it
managed
to
look
gaunt
its
windows
stared
with
the
skull
emptiness
of
all
windows
in
empty
houses
that
are
to
be
lived
in
no
more
of
course
the
rowdy
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
had
been
at
work
many
of
these
haggard
windows
were
broken
the
front
door
stood
ajar
forced
open
and
idiot
salacity
in
white
chalk
was
smeared
everywhere
upon
the
pillars
and
stonework
of
the
verandas
george
walked
by
the
mansion
hurriedly
and
came
home
to
his
house
for
the
last
time
emptiness
was
there
too
and
the
closing
of
the
door
resounded
through
bare
rooms
for
downstairs
there
was
no
furniture
in
the
house
except
a
kitchen
table
in
the
dining
room
which
fanny
had
kept
for
dinner
she
said
though
as
she
was
to
cook
and
serve
that
meal
herself
george
had
his
doubts
about
her
name
for
it
upstairs
she
had
retained
her
own
furniture
and
george
had
been
living
in
his
mother
room
having
sent
everything
from
his
own
to
the
auction
isabel
room
was
still
as
it
had
been
but
the
furniture
would
be
moved
with
fanny
to
new
quarters
in
the
morning
fanny
had
made
plans
for
her
nephew
as
well
as
herself
she
had
found
a
kitchenette
apartment
in
an
apartment
house
where
several
old
friends
of
hers
had
established
themselves
elderly
widows
of
citizens
once
prominent
and
other
retired
gentry
people
used
their
own
kitchenettes
for
breakfast
and
lunch
but
there
was
a
arrangement
for
dinner
on
the
ground
floor
and
after
dinner
bridge
was
played
all
evening
an
attraction
powerful
with
fanny
she
had
made
all
the
arrangements
she
reported
and
nervously
appealed
for
approval
asking
if
she
had
shown
herself
pretty
practical
in
such
matters
george
acquiesced
not
thinking
of
what
she
said
and
not
realizing
to
what
it
committed
him
he
began
to
realize
it
now
as
he
wandered
about
the
dismantled
house
he
was
far
from
sure
that
he
was
willing
to
go
and
live
in
a
apartment
with
fanny
and
eat
breakfast
and
lunch
with
her
prepared
by
herself
in
the
kitchenette
and
dinner
at
the
table
in
such
a
pretty
colonial
dining
room
so
fanny
described
it
at
a
little
round
table
they
would
have
all
to
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
dozen
little
round
tables
which
other
relics
of
disrupted
families
would
have
all
to
themselves
for
the
first
time
now
that
the
change
was
imminent
george
began
to
develop
before
his
mind
eye
pictures
of
what
he
was
in
for
and
they
appalled
him
he
decided
that
such
a
life
verged
upon
the
sheerly
unbearable
and
that
after
all
there
were
some
things
left
that
he
just
could
stand
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
to
his
aunt
about
it
at
dinner
and
tell
her
that
he
preferred
to
ask
bronson
to
let
him
put
a
a
trunk
and
a
folding
rubber
bathtub
behind
a
screen
in
the
dark
rear
room
of
the
office
george
felt
that
this
would
be
infinitely
more
tolerable
and
he
could
eat
at
restaurants
especially
as
about
all
he
ever
wanted
nowadays
was
coffee
but
at
dinner
he
decided
to
put
off
telling
fanny
of
his
plan
until
later
she
was
so
nervous
and
so
distressed
about
the
failure
of
her
efforts
with
sweetbreads
and
macaroni
and
she
was
so
eager
in
her
talk
of
how
comfortable
they
would
be
by
this
time
she
fluttered
on
her
nervousness
increasing
saying
how
nice
it
would
be
for
him
when
he
came
from
work
in
the
evenings
to
be
among
nice
people
people
who
know
who
we
are
and
to
have
a
pleasant
game
of
bridge
with
people
who
are
really
old
friends
of
the
family
when
they
stopped
probing
among
the
scorched
fragments
she
had
set
forth
george
lingered
downstairs
waiting
for
a
better
opportunity
to
introduce
his
own
subject
but
when
he
heard
dismaying
sounds
from
the
kitchen
he
gave
up
there
was
a
crash
then
a
shower
of
crashes
falling
tin
clamoured
to
be
heard
above
the
shattering
of
porcelain
and
over
all
rose
fanny
wail
of
lamentation
for
the
treasures
saved
from
the
sale
but
now
lost
forever
to
the
fanny
was
nervous
indeed
so
nervous
that
she
could
not
trust
her
hands
for
a
moment
george
thought
she
might
have
been
injured
but
before
he
reached
the
kitchen
he
heard
her
sweeping
at
the
fragments
and
turned
back
he
put
off
speaking
to
fanny
until
morning
things
more
insistent
than
his
vague
plans
for
a
in
office
had
possession
of
his
mind
as
he
went
upstairs
moving
his
hand
slowly
along
the
smooth
walnut
railing
of
the
balustrade
half
way
to
the
landing
he
stopped
turned
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
heavy
doors
masking
the
black
emptiness
that
had
been
the
library
here
he
had
stood
on
what
he
now
knew
was
the
worst
day
of
his
life
here
he
had
stood
when
his
mother
passed
through
that
doorway
with
her
brother
to
learn
what
her
son
had
done
he
went
on
more
heavily
more
slowly
and
more
heavily
and
slowly
still
entered
isabel
room
and
shut
the
door
he
did
not
come
forth
again
and
bade
fanny
through
the
closed
door
when
she
stopped
outside
it
later
i
put
all
the
lights
out
george
she
said
everything
all
very
well
he
called
she
did
not
go
i
sure
we
going
to
enjoy
the
new
little
home
george
she
said
timidly
i
try
hard
to
make
things
nice
for
you
and
the
people
really
are
lovely
you
must
feel
as
if
things
are
altogether
gloomy
george
i
know
everything
going
to
turn
out
all
right
you
young
and
strong
and
you
have
a
good
mind
and
i
sure
she
hesitated
i
sure
your
mother
watching
over
you
georgie
aunt
his
voice
had
a
strangled
sound
in
spite
of
him
but
she
seemed
not
to
notice
it
and
he
heard
her
go
to
her
own
room
and
lock
herself
in
with
bolt
and
key
against
burglars
she
had
said
the
one
thing
she
should
not
have
said
just
then
i
sure
your
mother
watching
over
you
she
had
meant
to
be
kind
but
it
destroyed
his
last
chance
for
sleep
that
night
he
would
have
slept
little
if
she
had
not
said
it
but
since
she
had
said
it
he
could
not
sleep
at
all
for
he
knew
that
it
was
true
if
it
could
be
true
and
that
his
mother
if
she
still
lived
in
spirit
would
be
weeping
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
of
silence
weeping
and
seeking
for
some
gate
to
let
her
through
so
that
she
could
come
and
watch
over
he
felt
that
if
there
were
such
gates
they
were
surely
barred
they
were
like
those
awful
library
doors
downstairs
which
had
shut
her
in
to
begin
the
suffering
to
which
he
had
consigned
her
the
room
was
still
isabel
nothing
had
been
changed
even
the
photographs
of
george
of
the
major
and
of
brother
george
still
stood
on
her
and
in
a
drawer
of
her
desk
was
an
old
picture
of
eugene
and
lucy
taken
together
which
george
had
found
but
had
slowly
closed
away
again
from
sight
not
touching
it
everything
would
be
gone
and
he
had
heard
there
was
not
long
to
wait
before
the
house
itself
would
be
demolished
the
very
space
which
tonight
was
still
isabel
room
would
be
cut
into
new
shapes
by
new
walls
and
floors
and
ceilings
yet
the
room
would
always
live
for
it
could
not
die
out
of
george
memory
it
would
live
as
long
as
he
did
and
it
would
always
be
murmurous
with
a
tragic
wistful
whispering
and
if
space
itself
can
be
haunted
as
memory
is
haunted
then
some
time
when
the
space
that
was
isabel
room
came
to
be
made
into
the
small
bedrooms
and
kitchenettes
already
designed
as
its
destiny
that
space
might
well
be
haunted
and
the
new
occupants
come
to
feel
that
some
seemingly
causeless
depression
hung
about
it
a
wraith
of
the
passion
that
filled
it
throughout
the
last
night
that
george
minafer
spent
there
whatever
remnants
of
the
old
arrogance
were
still
within
him
he
did
penance
for
his
deepest
sin
that
night
and
it
may
be
that
to
this
day
some
impressionable
overworked
woman
in
a
kitchenette
after
turning
out
the
light
will
seem
to
see
a
young
man
kneeling
in
the
darkness
shaking
convulsively
and
with
arms
outstretched
through
the
wall
clutching
at
the
covers
of
a
shadowy
bed
it
may
seem
to
her
that
she
hears
the
faint
cry
over
and
over
mother
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
chapter
xxxii
at
least
it
may
be
claimed
for
george
that
his
last
night
in
the
house
where
he
had
been
born
was
not
occupied
with
his
own
disheartening
future
but
with
sorrow
for
what
sacrifices
his
pride
and
youth
had
demanded
of
others
and
early
in
the
morning
he
came
downstairs
and
tried
to
help
fanny
make
coffee
on
the
kitchen
range
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
last
night
aunt
fanny
he
said
as
she
finally
discovered
that
an
amber
fluid
more
like
tea
than
coffee
was
as
near
ready
to
be
taken
into
the
human
system
as
it
would
ever
be
i
think
i
better
do
it
she
set
the
back
upon
the
stove
with
a
little
crash
and
looking
at
him
in
a
desperate
anxiety
began
to
twist
her
dainty
apron
between
her
fingers
without
any
consciousness
of
what
she
was
doing
why
why
she
stammered
but
she
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
that
was
why
she
had
been
more
and
more
nervous
had
perhaps
perhaps
we
better
get
the
the
things
moved
to
the
little
new
home
first
george
let
he
interrupted
quietly
though
at
her
phrase
the
little
new
home
his
pungent
impulse
was
to
utter
one
loud
shout
and
run
it
was
about
this
new
place
that
i
wanted
to
speak
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
decided
i
want
you
to
take
all
the
things
from
mother
room
and
use
them
and
keep
them
for
me
and
i
sure
the
little
apartment
will
be
just
what
you
like
and
with
the
extra
bedroom
probably
you
could
find
some
woman
friend
to
come
and
live
there
and
share
the
expense
with
you
but
i
decided
on
another
arrangement
for
myself
and
so
i
not
going
with
you
i
do
suppose
you
mind
much
and
i
do
see
why
you
should
mind
particularly
that
is
i
not
very
lively
company
these
days
or
any
days
for
that
matter
i
ca
imagine
you
or
any
one
else
being
much
attached
to
me
so
he
stopped
in
amazement
no
chair
had
been
left
in
the
kitchen
but
fanny
gave
a
despairing
glance
around
her
in
search
of
one
then
sank
abruptly
and
sat
flat
upon
the
floor
you
going
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
she
gasped
what
on
earth
george
sprang
to
her
get
up
aunt
fanny
i
ca
i
too
weak
let
me
alone
george
and
as
he
released
the
wrist
he
had
seized
to
help
her
she
repeated
the
dismal
prophecy
which
for
days
she
had
been
matching
against
her
hopes
you
going
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
why
no
aunt
fanny
he
protested
at
first
i
have
been
something
of
a
burden
on
you
i
to
get
eight
dollars
a
week
about
a
month
the
rent
dollars
a
month
and
the
dinner
runs
up
to
over
dollars
apiece
so
with
my
half
of
the
rent
eighteen
dollars
i
have
less
than
nothing
left
out
of
my
salary
to
pay
my
share
of
the
groceries
for
all
the
breakfasts
and
luncheons
you
see
you
not
only
be
doing
all
the
housework
and
cooking
but
be
paying
more
of
the
expenses
than
i
she
stared
at
him
with
such
a
forlorn
blankness
as
he
had
never
seen
i
be
paying
she
said
feebly
i
be
paying
certainly
you
would
you
be
using
more
of
your
money
than
my
money
fanny
chin
drooped
upon
her
thin
chest
and
she
laughed
miserably
i
got
dollars
that
you
mean
until
the
interest
is
due
again
i
mean
that
all
fanny
said
i
mean
that
all
there
is
there
wo
be
any
more
interest
because
there
is
any
why
you
told
she
shook
her
head
no
i
have
told
you
then
it
was
uncle
george
he
told
me
you
had
enough
to
fall
back
on
that
just
what
he
said
fall
back
on
he
said
you
lost
more
than
you
should
in
the
headlight
company
but
he
insisted
that
you
should
hold
out
enough
to
live
on
and
you
very
wisely
followed
his
i
know
she
said
weakly
i
told
him
so
he
did
know
or
else
forgotten
how
much
wilbur
insurance
amounted
to
and
i
oh
it
seemed
such
a
sure
way
to
make
a
real
fortune
out
of
a
little
and
i
thought
i
could
do
something
for
you
george
if
you
ever
came
to
need
it
and
it
all
looked
so
bright
i
just
thought
i
put
it
all
in
i
did
every
cent
except
my
last
interest
payment
and
it
good
lord
george
began
to
pace
up
and
down
on
the
worn
planks
of
the
bare
floor
why
on
earth
did
you
wait
till
now
to
tell
such
a
thing
as
this
i
could
tell
till
i
had
to
she
said
piteously
i
could
till
george
amberson
went
away
he
could
do
anything
to
help
anyhow
and
i
just
did
want
him
to
talk
to
me
about
it
he
been
at
me
so
much
about
not
putting
more
in
than
i
could
afford
to
lose
and
said
he
considered
he
had
my
my
word
i
was
putting
more
than
that
in
it
so
i
thought
what
was
the
use
what
was
the
use
of
going
over
it
all
with
him
and
having
him
reproach
me
and
probably
reproach
himself
it
would
do
any
good
not
any
good
on
she
got
out
her
lace
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
nothing
does
any
good
i
guess
in
this
old
world
oh
how
tired
of
this
old
world
i
am
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
just
tried
to
go
ahead
and
be
as
practical
as
i
could
and
arrange
some
way
for
us
to
live
oh
i
knew
you
did
want
me
george
you
always
teased
me
and
berated
me
whenever
you
had
a
chance
from
the
time
you
were
a
little
boy
you
did
so
later
you
tried
to
be
kinder
to
me
but
you
do
want
me
around
oh
i
can
see
that
much
you
suppose
i
want
to
thrust
myself
on
you
do
you
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
thrusting
yourself
on
a
person
you
know
does
want
you
but
i
knew
you
ought
to
be
left
all
alone
in
the
world
it
is
good
i
knew
your
mother
want
me
to
watch
over
you
and
try
to
have
something
like
a
home
for
you
i
know
she
want
me
to
do
what
i
tried
to
do
fanny
tears
were
bitter
now
and
her
voice
hoarse
and
wet
was
tragically
sincere
i
tried
i
tried
to
be
practical
to
look
after
your
interests
to
make
things
as
nice
for
you
as
i
could
i
walked
my
heels
down
looking
for
a
place
for
us
to
live
i
walked
and
walked
over
this
town
i
did
ride
one
block
on
a
i
would
use
five
cents
no
matter
how
tired
i
oh
she
sobbed
uncontrollably
oh
and
now
you
do
want
you
want
you
want
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
you
george
stopped
walking
in
god
name
aunt
fanny
he
said
quit
spreading
out
your
handkerchief
and
drying
it
and
then
getting
it
all
wet
again
i
mean
stop
crying
do
and
for
heaven
sake
get
up
sit
there
with
your
back
against
the
boiler
and
it
not
hot
fanny
sniffled
it
cold
the
plumbers
disconnected
it
i
would
mind
if
they
had
i
would
mind
if
it
burned
me
oh
my
lord
he
went
to
her
and
lifted
her
for
god
sake
get
up
come
let
take
the
coffee
into
the
other
room
and
see
what
to
be
he
got
her
to
her
feet
she
leaned
upon
him
already
somewhat
comforted
and
with
his
arm
about
her
he
conducted
her
to
the
dining
room
and
seated
her
in
one
of
the
two
kitchen
chairs
which
had
been
placed
at
the
rough
table
there
he
said
get
over
it
then
he
brought
the
some
lumps
of
sugar
in
a
tin
pan
and
finding
that
all
the
were
broken
set
water
glasses
upon
the
table
and
poured
some
of
the
pale
coffee
into
them
by
this
time
fanny
spirits
had
revived
appreciably
she
looked
up
with
a
plaintive
eagerness
i
had
bought
all
my
fall
clothes
george
she
said
and
i
paid
every
bill
i
owed
i
do
owe
a
cent
for
clothes
that
good
he
said
wanly
and
he
had
a
moment
of
physical
dizziness
that
decided
him
to
sit
down
quickly
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
fanny
nephew
but
married
to
her
he
passed
his
pale
hand
over
his
paler
forehead
well
let
see
where
we
stand
he
said
feebly
let
see
if
we
can
afford
this
place
you
fanny
continued
to
brighten
i
sure
it
the
most
practical
plan
we
could
possibly
have
worked
out
george
and
it
is
a
comfort
to
be
among
nice
people
i
think
we
both
enjoy
it
because
the
truth
is
been
keeping
too
much
to
ourselves
for
a
long
while
it
is
good
for
i
was
thinking
about
the
money
aunt
fanny
you
see
i
sure
we
can
manage
it
she
interrupted
quickly
there
really
is
a
cheaper
place
in
town
that
we
could
actually
live
in
and
be
here
she
interrupted
herself
oh
there
one
great
economy
i
forgot
to
tell
you
and
it
especially
an
economy
for
you
because
you
always
too
generous
about
such
things
they
do
allow
any
tipping
they
have
signs
that
prohibit
that
good
he
said
grimly
but
the
rent
is
dollars
a
month
the
dinner
is
and
a
half
for
each
of
us
and
we
got
to
have
some
provision
for
other
food
we
wo
need
any
clothes
for
a
year
perhaps
oh
longer
she
exclaimed
so
you
see
i
see
that
and
make
he
said
at
the
lowest
we
need
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
i
going
to
make
i
thought
of
that
george
she
said
confidently
and
i
sure
it
will
be
all
right
you
be
earning
a
great
deal
more
than
that
very
i
do
see
any
prospect
of
it
not
till
i
admitted
to
the
bar
and
that
will
be
two
years
at
the
fanny
confidence
was
not
shaken
i
know
you
be
getting
on
faster
than
faster
george
echoed
gravely
we
got
to
have
more
than
that
to
start
well
there
the
six
hundred
dollars
from
the
sale
six
hundred
and
twelve
dollars
it
it
is
six
hundred
and
twelve
now
said
george
it
about
one
hundred
and
fanny
showed
a
momentary
dismay
why
how
i
lent
uncle
george
two
hundred
i
gave
fifty
apiece
to
old
sam
and
those
two
other
old
darkies
that
worked
for
grandfather
so
long
and
ten
to
each
of
the
servants
here
and
you
gave
me
she
said
thoughtfully
for
the
first
month
rent
in
did
i
i
forgotten
well
with
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
in
bank
and
our
expenses
a
hundred
a
month
it
does
seem
as
if
this
new
place
still
she
interrupted
we
have
paid
the
first
month
rent
in
advance
and
it
does
seem
to
be
the
most
practical
george
rose
see
here
aunt
fanny
he
said
decisively
you
stay
here
and
look
after
the
moving
old
frank
does
expect
me
until
afternoon
this
first
day
but
i
go
and
see
him
it
was
early
and
old
frank
just
established
at
his
big
desk
was
surprised
when
his
prospective
assistant
and
pupil
walked
in
he
was
pleased
as
well
as
surprised
however
and
rose
offering
a
cordial
old
hand
the
real
flare
he
said
the
real
flare
for
the
law
that
right
could
wait
till
afternoon
to
begin
i
delighted
that
you
i
wanted
to
say
george
began
but
his
patron
cut
him
off
wait
just
a
minute
my
boy
i
prepared
a
little
speech
of
welcome
and
even
though
you
five
hours
ahead
of
time
i
mean
to
deliver
it
first
of
all
your
grandfather
was
my
old
and
my
best
client
for
years
i
prospered
through
my
connection
with
his
business
and
his
grandson
is
welcome
in
my
office
and
to
my
best
efforts
in
his
behalf
but
i
want
to
confess
georgie
that
during
your
earlier
youth
i
may
have
had
some
slight
feeling
of
well
prejudice
not
altogether
in
your
favour
but
whatever
slight
feeling
it
was
it
began
to
vanish
on
that
afternoon
a
good
while
ago
when
you
stood
up
to
your
aunt
amelia
amberson
as
you
did
in
the
major
library
and
talked
to
her
as
a
man
and
a
gentleman
should
i
saw
then
what
good
stuff
was
in
you
and
i
always
wanted
to
mention
it
if
my
prejudice
had
altogether
vanished
after
that
the
last
vestiges
disappeared
during
these
trying
times
that
have
come
upon
you
this
past
year
when
i
have
been
a
witness
to
the
depth
of
feeling
you
shown
and
your
quiet
consideration
for
your
grandfather
and
for
everyone
else
around
you
i
just
want
to
add
that
i
think
you
find
an
honest
pleasure
now
in
industry
and
frugality
that
would
have
come
to
you
in
a
more
frivolous
career
the
law
is
a
jealous
mistress
and
a
stern
mistress
but
a
george
had
stood
before
him
in
great
and
increasing
embarrassment
and
he
was
unable
to
allow
the
address
to
proceed
to
its
conclusion
i
ca
do
it
he
burst
out
i
ca
take
her
for
my
what
i
come
to
tell
you
i
got
to
find
something
that
quicker
i
ca
old
frank
got
a
little
red
let
sit
down
he
said
what
the
trouble
george
told
him
the
old
gentleman
listened
sympathetically
only
murmuring
well
well
from
time
to
time
and
nodding
acquiescence
you
see
she
set
her
mind
on
this
apartment
george
explained
got
some
old
cronies
there
and
i
guess
she
been
looking
forward
to
the
games
of
bridge
and
the
kind
of
harmless
gossip
that
goes
on
in
such
places
really
it
a
life
she
like
better
than
anything
else
better
than
that
she
lived
at
home
i
really
believe
it
struck
me
just
about
got
to
have
it
and
after
all
she
could
hardly
have
anything
this
comes
pretty
heavily
upon
me
you
know
said
old
frank
i
got
her
into
that
headlight
company
and
she
fooled
me
about
her
resources
as
much
as
she
did
your
uncle
george
i
was
never
your
father
adviser
if
you
remember
and
when
the
insurance
was
turned
over
to
her
some
other
lawyer
arranged
it
probably
your
father
but
it
comes
pretty
heavily
on
me
and
i
feel
a
certain
not
at
all
i
taking
the
and
george
smiled
with
one
corner
of
his
mouth
she
not
your
aunt
you
know
well
i
unable
to
see
even
if
she
yours
that
a
young
man
is
morally
called
upon
to
give
up
a
career
at
the
law
to
provide
his
aunt
with
a
favourable
opportunity
to
play
bridge
whist
no
george
agreed
but
i
have
begun
my
at
the
law
so
it
ca
be
said
i
making
any
considerable
sacrifice
i
tell
you
how
it
is
he
flushed
and
looking
out
of
the
streaked
and
smoky
window
beside
which
he
was
sitting
spoke
with
difficulty
i
feel
as
if
as
if
perhaps
i
had
one
or
two
pretty
important
things
in
my
life
to
make
up
for
well
i
ca
i
ca
make
them
up
to
to
whom
i
would
it
struck
me
that
as
i
could
i
might
be
a
little
decent
to
somebody
else
perhaps
if
i
could
manage
it
i
never
have
been
particularly
decent
to
poor
old
aunt
oh
i
do
know
i
should
say
that
a
little
youthful
teasing
i
doubt
if
she
minded
so
much
she
felt
your
father
death
terrifically
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
she
had
a
fairly
comfortable
to
now
if
she
was
disposed
to
take
it
that
but
to
now
is
the
important
thing
george
said
now
is
now
and
you
see
i
ca
wait
two
years
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
and
begin
to
practice
i
got
to
start
in
at
something
else
that
pays
from
the
start
and
that
what
i
come
to
you
about
i
have
an
idea
you
well
i
glad
of
that
said
old
frank
smiling
i
ca
think
of
anything
just
at
this
minute
that
pays
from
the
i
only
know
of
one
thing
what
is
it
george
flushed
again
but
managed
to
laugh
at
his
own
embarrassment
i
suppose
i
about
as
ignorant
of
business
as
anybody
in
the
world
he
said
but
i
heard
they
pay
very
high
wages
to
people
in
dangerous
trades
i
always
heard
they
did
and
i
sure
it
must
be
true
i
mean
people
that
handle
touchy
chemicals
or
high
explosives
men
in
dynamite
factories
or
who
take
things
of
that
sort
about
the
country
in
wagons
and
shoot
oil
wells
i
thought
i
see
if
you
could
tell
me
something
more
about
it
or
else
introduce
me
to
someone
who
could
and
then
i
thought
i
see
if
i
could
get
something
of
the
kind
to
do
as
soon
as
possible
my
nerves
are
good
i
muscular
and
i
got
a
steady
hand
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
about
the
only
line
of
work
in
the
world
that
i
fitted
for
i
wanted
to
get
started
if
i
old
frank
gave
him
a
long
stare
at
first
this
scrutiny
was
sharply
incredulous
then
it
was
grave
finally
it
developed
into
a
threat
of
overwhelming
laughter
a
forked
vein
in
his
forehead
became
more
visible
and
his
eyes
seemed
about
to
protrude
but
he
controlled
his
impulse
and
rising
took
up
his
hat
and
overcoat
all
right
he
said
if
you
promise
not
to
get
blown
up
i
go
with
you
to
see
if
we
can
find
the
then
meaning
what
he
said
but
amazed
that
he
did
mean
it
he
added
you
certainly
are
the
most
practical
young
man
i
ever
met
chapter
xxxiii
they
found
the
job
it
needed
an
apprenticeship
of
only
six
weeks
during
which
period
george
was
to
receive
fifteen
dollars
a
week
after
that
he
would
get
this
settled
the
apartment
question
and
fanny
was
presently
established
in
a
greater
contentment
than
she
had
known
for
a
long
time
early
every
morning
she
made
something
she
called
and
believed
to
be
coffee
for
george
and
he
was
gallant
enough
not
to
undeceive
her
she
lunched
alone
in
her
kitchenette
for
place
of
employment
was
ten
miles
out
of
town
on
an
interurban
and
he
seldom
returned
before
seven
fanny
found
partners
for
bridge
by
two
almost
every
afternoon
and
she
played
until
about
six
then
she
got
george
dinner
clothes
out
for
him
he
maintained
this
habit
and
she
changed
her
own
dress
when
he
arrived
he
usually
denied
that
he
was
tired
though
he
sometimes
looked
tired
particularly
during
the
first
few
months
and
he
explained
to
her
frequently
looking
bored
enough
with
her
insistence
that
his
work
was
fairly
light
and
fairly
congenial
fanny
had
the
foggiest
idea
of
what
it
was
though
she
noticed
that
it
roughened
his
hands
and
stained
them
something
in
those
new
chemical
works
she
explained
to
casual
inquirers
it
was
not
more
definite
in
her
own
mind
respect
for
george
undoubtedly
increased
within
her
however
and
she
told
him
she
always
had
a
feeling
he
might
turn
out
to
be
a
mechanical
genius
or
george
assented
with
a
nod
as
the
easiest
course
open
to
him
he
did
not
take
a
hand
at
bridge
after
dinner
his
provisions
for
fanny
happiness
refused
to
extend
that
far
and
at
the
table
he
was
a
rather
discouraging
boarder
he
was
considered
affected
and
absurdly
by
the
one
or
two
young
men
and
the
three
or
four
young
women
who
enlivened
the
elderly
retreat
and
was
possibly
less
popular
there
than
he
had
been
elsewhere
during
his
life
though
he
was
now
nothing
worse
than
a
coldly
polite
young
man
who
kept
to
himself
after
dinner
he
would
escort
his
aunt
from
the
table
in
some
state
not
wholly
unaccompanied
by
a
leerish
wink
or
two
from
the
wags
of
the
place
and
he
would
leave
her
at
the
door
of
the
communal
parlours
and
card
rooms
with
a
formality
in
his
bow
of
farewell
which
afforded
an
amusing
contrast
to
fanny
always
voluble
protests
she
never
failed
to
urge
loudly
that
he
really
must
come
and
play
just
this
once
and
not
go
hiding
from
everybody
in
his
room
every
evening
like
this
at
least
some
of
the
other
inhabitants
found
the
contrast
amusing
for
sometimes
as
he
departed
stiffly
toward
the
elevator
leaving
her
still
entreating
in
the
doorway
though
with
one
eye
already
on
her
table
to
see
that
it
was
not
seized
a
titter
would
follow
him
which
he
was
no
doubt
meant
to
hear
he
did
not
care
whether
they
laughed
or
not
and
once
as
he
passed
the
one
or
two
young
men
of
the
place
entertaining
the
three
or
four
young
women
who
were
elbowing
and
jerking
on
a
settee
in
the
lobby
he
heard
a
voice
inquiring
quickly
as
he
passed
what
makes
people
tired
work
well
what
the
answer
then
with
an
intentional
outbreak
of
mirth
the
answer
was
given
by
two
loudly
whispering
voices
together
a
boarder
george
did
care
on
sunday
mornings
fanny
went
to
church
and
george
took
long
walks
he
explored
the
new
city
and
found
it
hideous
especially
in
the
early
spring
before
the
leaves
of
the
shade
trees
were
out
then
the
town
was
fagged
with
the
long
winter
and
blacked
with
the
heavier
smoke
that
had
been
held
close
to
the
earth
by
the
it
bred
was
damply
streaked
with
the
soot
the
walls
of
the
houses
inside
and
out
the
gray
curtains
at
the
windows
the
windows
themselves
the
dirty
cement
and
unswept
asphalt
underfoot
the
very
sky
overhead
throughout
this
murky
season
he
continued
his
explorations
never
seeing
a
face
he
knew
for
on
sunday
those
whom
he
remembered
or
who
might
remember
him
were
not
apt
to
be
found
within
the
limits
of
the
town
but
were
congenially
occupied
with
the
new
outdoor
life
which
had
come
to
be
the
mode
since
his
boyhood
he
and
fanny
were
pretty
thoroughly
buried
away
within
the
bigness
of
the
city
one
of
his
sunday
walks
that
spring
he
made
into
a
sour
pilgrimage
it
was
a
misty
morning
of
belated
snow
slush
and
suited
him
to
a
perfection
of
miserableness
as
he
stood
before
the
great
dripping
department
store
which
now
occupied
the
big
plot
of
ground
where
once
had
stood
both
the
amberson
hotel
and
the
amberson
opera
house
from
there
he
drifted
to
the
old
amberson
block
but
this
was
fallen
into
a
business
had
stagnated
here
the
old
structure
had
not
been
replaced
but
a
cavernous
entryway
for
trucks
had
been
torn
in
its
front
and
upon
the
cornice
where
the
old
separate
metal
letters
had
spelt
amberson
block
there
was
a
long
billboard
sign
doogan
to
spare
himself
nothing
he
went
out
national
avenue
and
saw
the
piles
of
wreckage
where
the
mansion
and
his
mother
house
had
been
and
where
the
major
five
new
houses
had
stood
for
these
were
down
too
to
make
room
for
the
great
tenement
already
shaped
in
unending
lines
of
foundation
but
the
fountain
of
neptune
was
gone
at
last
and
george
was
glad
that
it
was
he
turned
away
from
the
devastated
site
thinking
bitterly
that
the
only
amberson
mark
still
left
upon
the
town
was
the
name
of
the
boulevard
amberson
boulevard
but
he
had
reckoned
without
the
city
council
of
the
new
order
and
by
an
unpleasant
coincidence
while
the
thought
was
still
in
his
mind
his
eye
fell
upon
a
metal
oblong
sign
upon
the
lamppost
at
the
corner
there
were
two
of
these
little
signs
upon
the
at
an
obtuse
angle
to
each
other
one
to
give
the
name
of
national
avenue
the
other
to
acquaint
them
with
amberson
boulevard
but
the
one
upon
which
should
have
been
stenciled
amberson
boulevard
exhibited
the
words
tenth
george
stared
at
it
hard
then
he
walked
quickly
along
the
boulevard
to
the
next
corner
and
looked
at
the
little
sign
there
tenth
it
had
begun
to
rain
but
george
stood
unheeding
staring
at
the
little
sign
damn
them
he
said
finally
and
turning
up
his
plodded
back
through
the
soggy
streets
toward
the
utilitarian
impudence
of
the
city
authorities
put
a
thought
into
his
mind
a
week
earlier
he
had
happened
to
stroll
into
the
large
parlour
of
the
apartment
house
finding
it
empty
and
on
the
center
table
he
noticed
a
large
book
newly
printed
bearing
the
title
a
civic
history
and
beneath
the
title
the
rubric
biographies
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
and
families
in
the
history
of
the
he
had
glanced
at
it
absently
merely
noticing
the
title
and
and
wandered
out
of
the
room
thinking
of
other
things
and
feeling
no
curiosity
about
the
book
but
he
had
thought
of
it
several
times
since
with
a
faint
vague
uneasiness
and
now
when
he
entered
the
lobby
he
walked
directly
into
the
parlour
where
he
had
seen
the
book
the
room
was
empty
as
it
always
was
on
sunday
mornings
and
the
flamboyant
volume
was
still
upon
the
table
evidently
a
fixture
as
a
sort
of
local
almanach
de
gotha
or
burke
for
the
enlightenment
of
tenants
and
boarders
he
opened
it
finding
a
few
painful
steel
engravings
of
placid
faces
some
of
which
he
remembered
dimly
but
much
more
numerous
and
also
more
unfamiliar
to
him
were
the
pictures
of
neat
aggressive
men
with
clipped
short
hair
and
clipped
short
moustaches
almost
all
of
them
strangers
to
him
he
delayed
not
long
with
these
but
turned
to
the
index
where
the
names
of
the
five
hundred
most
prominent
citizens
and
families
in
the
history
of
the
city
were
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
and
ran
his
finger
down
the
column
of
a
abbett
abbott
abrams
adam
adams
adler
akers
albertsmeyer
alexander
allen
ambrose
ambuhl
anderson
andrews
appenbasch
archer
arszman
ashcraft
austin
avey
george
eyes
remained
for
some
time
fixed
on
the
thin
space
between
the
names
allen
and
then
he
closed
the
book
quietly
and
went
up
to
his
own
room
agreeing
with
the
elevator
boy
on
the
way
that
it
was
getting
to
be
a
mighty
nasty
wet
and
windy
day
outside
the
elevator
boy
noticed
nothing
unusual
about
him
and
neither
did
fanny
when
she
came
in
from
church
with
her
hat
ruined
an
hour
later
and
yet
something
had
happened
a
thing
which
years
ago
had
been
the
eagerest
hope
of
many
many
good
citizens
of
the
town
they
had
thought
of
it
longed
for
it
hoping
acutely
that
they
might
live
to
see
the
day
when
it
would
come
to
pass
and
now
it
had
happened
at
last
georgie
minafer
had
got
his
he
had
got
it
three
times
filled
and
running
over
the
city
had
rolled
over
his
heart
burying
it
under
as
it
rolled
over
the
major
and
buried
it
under
the
city
had
rolled
over
the
ambersons
and
buried
them
under
to
the
last
vestige
and
it
mattered
little
that
george
guessed
easily
enough
that
most
of
the
five
hundred
most
prominent
had
paid
something
substantial
to
defray
the
cost
of
steel
engraving
the
five
hundred
had
heaved
the
final
shovelful
of
soot
upon
that
heap
of
obscurity
wherein
the
ambersons
were
lost
forever
from
sight
and
history
quicksilver
in
a
nest
of
cracks
georgie
minafer
had
got
his
but
the
people
who
had
so
longed
for
it
were
not
there
to
see
it
and
they
never
knew
it
those
who
were
still
living
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
all
about
him
chapter
xxxiv
there
was
one
border
section
of
the
city
which
george
never
explored
in
his
sunday
morning
excursions
this
was
far
out
to
the
north
where
lay
the
new
elysian
fields
of
the
millionaires
though
he
once
went
as
far
in
that
direction
as
the
white
house
which
lucy
had
so
admired
long
ago
her
beautiful
george
looked
at
it
briefly
and
turned
back
rumbling
with
an
interior
laugh
of
some
grimness
the
house
was
white
no
longer
nothing
could
be
white
which
the
town
had
reached
and
the
town
reached
far
beyond
the
beautiful
white
house
now
the
owners
had
given
up
and
painted
it
a
despairing
chocolate
suitable
to
the
life
it
was
called
upon
to
endure
george
did
not
again
risk
going
even
so
far
as
that
in
the
direction
of
the
millionaires
although
their
settlement
began
at
least
two
miles
farther
out
his
thought
of
lucy
and
her
father
was
more
a
sensation
than
a
thought
and
may
be
compared
to
that
of
a
convicted
cashier
beset
by
recollections
of
the
bank
he
had
pillaged
there
are
some
thoughts
to
which
one
closes
the
mind
george
had
seen
eugene
only
once
since
their
calamitous
encounter
they
had
passed
on
opposite
sides
of
the
street
downtown
each
had
been
aware
of
the
other
and
each
had
been
aware
that
the
other
was
aware
of
him
and
yet
each
kept
his
eyes
straight
forward
and
neither
had
shown
a
perceptible
alteration
of
countenance
it
seemed
to
george
that
he
felt
emanating
from
the
outwardly
imperturbable
person
of
his
mother
old
friend
a
hate
that
was
like
a
hot
wind
at
his
mother
funeral
and
at
the
major
he
had
been
conscious
that
eugene
was
there
though
he
had
afterward
no
recollection
of
seeing
him
and
while
certain
of
his
presence
was
uncertain
how
he
knew
of
it
fanny
had
not
told
him
for
she
understood
george
well
enough
not
to
speak
to
him
of
eugene
or
lucy
nowadays
fanny
almost
never
saw
either
of
them
and
seldom
thought
of
them
so
sly
is
the
way
of
time
with
life
she
was
passing
middle
age
when
old
intensities
and
longings
grow
thin
and
flatten
out
as
fanny
herself
was
thinning
and
flattening
out
and
she
was
settling
down
contentedly
to
her
apartment
house
intimacies
she
was
precisely
suited
by
the
life
with
its
bridge
its
variable
alliances
and
shifting
feuds
and
the
long
whisperings
of
elderly
ladies
at
corridor
corners
those
eager
but
suppressed
conversations
all
sibilance
of
which
the
elevator
boy
declared
he
heard
the
words
she
said
a
million
times
and
the
word
she
five
million
the
apartment
house
suited
fanny
and
swallowed
her
the
city
was
so
big
now
that
people
disappeared
into
it
unnoticed
and
the
disappearance
of
fanny
and
her
nephew
was
not
exceptional
people
no
longer
knew
their
neighbours
as
a
matter
of
course
one
lived
for
years
next
door
to
strangers
that
sharpest
of
all
the
changes
since
the
old
days
and
a
friend
would
lose
sight
of
a
friend
for
a
year
and
not
know
it
one
may
day
george
thought
he
had
a
glimpse
of
lucy
he
was
not
certain
but
he
was
sufficiently
disturbed
in
spite
of
his
uncertainty
a
promotion
in
his
work
now
frequently
took
him
out
of
town
for
a
week
or
longer
and
it
was
upon
his
return
from
one
of
these
absences
that
he
had
the
strange
experience
he
had
walked
home
from
the
station
and
as
he
turned
the
corner
which
brought
him
in
sight
of
the
apartment
house
entrance
though
two
blocks
distant
from
it
he
saw
a
charming
little
figure
come
out
get
into
a
shiny
landaulet
automobile
and
drive
away
even
at
that
distance
no
one
could
have
any
doubt
that
the
little
figure
was
charming
and
the
height
the
quickness
and
decision
of
motion
even
the
swift
gesture
of
a
white
glove
toward
the
chauffeur
all
were
characteristic
of
lucy
george
was
instantly
subjected
to
a
shock
of
indefinable
nature
yet
definitely
a
shock
he
did
not
know
what
he
felt
but
he
knew
that
he
felt
heat
surged
over
him
probably
he
would
not
have
come
face
to
face
with
her
if
the
restoration
of
all
the
ancient
amberson
magnificence
could
have
been
his
reward
he
went
on
slowly
his
knees
shaky
but
he
found
fanny
not
at
home
she
had
been
out
all
afternoon
and
there
was
no
record
of
any
caller
and
he
began
to
wonder
then
to
doubt
if
the
small
lady
he
had
seen
in
the
distance
was
lucy
it
might
as
well
have
been
he
said
to
himself
since
any
one
who
looked
like
her
could
give
him
a
jolt
like
that
lucy
had
not
left
a
card
she
never
left
one
when
she
called
on
fanny
though
she
did
not
give
her
reasons
a
quite
definite
form
in
her
own
mind
she
came
seldom
this
was
but
the
third
time
that
year
and
when
she
did
come
george
was
not
mentioned
either
by
her
hostess
or
by
herself
an
oddity
contrived
between
the
two
ladies
without
either
of
them
realizing
how
odd
it
was
for
naturally
while
fanny
was
with
lucy
fanny
thought
of
george
and
what
time
lucy
had
aunt
before
her
eyes
she
could
not
well
avoid
the
thought
of
him
consequently
both
looked
as
they
talked
and
each
often
gave
a
wrong
answer
which
the
other
consistently
failed
to
notice
at
other
times
lucy
thoughts
of
george
were
anything
but
continuous
and
weeks
went
by
when
he
was
not
consciously
in
her
mind
at
all
her
life
was
a
busy
one
she
had
the
big
house
to
keep
up
she
had
a
garden
to
keep
up
too
a
large
and
beautiful
garden
she
represented
her
father
as
a
director
for
half
a
dozen
public
charity
organizations
and
did
private
charity
work
of
her
own
being
a
proxy
mother
of
several
large
families
and
she
had
danced
down
as
she
said
groups
from
eight
or
nine
classes
of
new
graduates
returned
from
the
universities
without
marrying
any
of
them
but
she
still
danced
and
still
did
not
marry
her
father
observing
this
circumstance
happily
yet
with
some
hypocritical
concern
spoke
of
it
to
her
one
day
as
they
stood
in
her
garden
i
suppose
i
want
to
shoot
him
he
said
with
attempted
lightness
but
i
must
be
an
old
pig
i
build
you
a
beautiful
house
close
by
just
over
no
no
that
would
be
like
she
began
impulsively
then
checked
herself
george
amberson
comparison
of
the
georgian
house
to
the
amberson
mansion
had
come
into
her
mind
and
she
thought
that
another
new
house
built
close
by
for
her
would
be
like
the
house
the
major
built
for
isabel
like
what
she
looked
serious
and
when
he
reverted
to
his
idea
of
some
day
grudgingly
surrendering
her
up
to
a
suitor
she
invented
a
legend
did
you
ever
hear
the
indian
name
for
that
little
grove
of
beech
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
she
asked
him
no
and
you
never
did
either
he
laughed
do
be
so
sure
i
read
a
great
deal
more
than
i
used
to
getting
ready
for
my
bookish
days
when
i
have
to
do
something
solid
in
the
evenings
and
wo
be
asked
to
dance
any
more
even
by
the
very
youngest
boys
who
think
it
a
sporting
event
to
dance
with
the
oldest
of
the
girls
the
name
of
the
grove
was
and
it
means
does
sound
like
indian
names
do
there
was
a
bad
indian
chief
lived
in
the
grove
before
the
white
settlers
came
he
was
the
worst
indian
that
ever
lived
and
his
name
was
it
was
that
means
what
his
name
was
vendonah
the
same
thing
as
i
see
said
eugene
thoughtfully
he
gave
her
a
quick
look
and
then
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
end
of
the
garden
path
go
vendonah
was
an
unspeakable
case
lucy
continued
he
was
so
proud
that
he
wore
iron
shoes
and
he
walked
over
people
faces
with
them
he
was
always
killing
people
that
way
and
so
at
last
the
tribe
decided
that
it
was
a
good
enough
excuse
for
him
that
he
was
young
and
inexperienced
he
have
to
go
they
took
him
down
to
the
river
and
put
him
in
a
canoe
and
pushed
him
out
from
shore
and
then
they
ran
along
the
bank
and
would
let
him
land
until
at
last
the
current
carried
the
canoe
out
into
the
middle
and
then
on
down
to
the
ocean
and
he
never
got
back
they
did
want
him
back
of
course
and
if
he
been
able
to
manage
it
they
have
put
him
in
another
canoe
and
shoved
him
out
into
the
river
again
but
still
they
did
elect
another
chief
in
his
place
other
tribes
thought
that
was
curious
and
wondered
about
it
a
lot
but
finally
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
beech
grove
people
were
afraid
a
new
chief
might
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
indian
too
and
wear
iron
shoes
like
vendonah
but
they
were
wrong
because
the
real
reason
was
that
the
tribe
had
led
such
an
exciting
life
under
vendonah
that
they
could
settle
down
to
anything
tamer
he
was
awful
but
he
always
kept
things
happening
terrible
things
of
course
they
hated
him
but
they
were
able
to
discover
any
other
warrior
that
they
wanted
to
make
chief
in
his
place
i
suppose
it
was
a
little
like
drinking
a
glass
of
too
strong
wine
and
then
trying
to
take
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
with
barley
water
they
could
help
feeling
that
i
see
said
eugene
so
that
why
they
named
the
place
it
must
have
and
so
you
going
to
stay
here
in
your
garden
he
said
musingly
you
think
it
better
to
keep
on
walking
these
sunshiny
gravel
paths
between
your
and
growing
to
look
like
a
pensive
garden
lady
in
a
victorian
i
suppose
i
like
the
tribe
that
lived
here
papa
i
had
too
much
unpleasant
excitement
it
was
unpleasant
but
it
was
excitement
i
want
any
more
in
fact
i
do
want
anything
but
you
do
he
looked
at
her
keenly
and
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
but
he
seemed
perplexed
rather
doubtful
what
was
the
name
of
the
grove
he
asked
the
indian
name
i
no
it
was
that
was
the
name
you
i
i
see
you
have
he
said
his
look
of
perplexity
remaining
perhaps
you
remember
the
chief
name
she
shook
her
head
again
i
do
at
this
he
laughed
but
not
very
heartily
and
walked
slowly
to
the
house
leaving
her
bending
over
a
and
a
shade
more
pensive
than
the
most
pensive
garden
lady
in
any
victorian
engraving
next
day
it
happened
that
this
same
vendonah
or
became
the
subject
of
a
chance
conversation
between
eugene
and
his
old
friend
kinney
father
of
the
fred
the
two
gentlemen
found
themselves
smoking
in
neighbouring
leather
chairs
beside
a
broad
window
at
the
club
after
lunch
kinney
had
remarked
that
he
expected
to
get
his
family
established
at
the
seashore
by
the
fourth
of
july
and
following
a
train
of
thought
he
paused
and
chuckled
fourth
of
july
reminds
me
he
said
have
you
heard
what
that
georgie
minafer
is
doing
no
i
have
said
eugene
and
his
friend
failed
to
notice
the
crispness
of
the
utterance
well
sir
kinney
chuckled
again
it
beats
the
devil
my
boy
fred
told
me
about
it
yesterday
he
a
friend
of
this
young
henry
akers
son
of
akers
of
the
akers
chemical
company
it
seems
this
young
akers
asked
fred
if
he
knew
a
fellow
named
minafer
because
he
knew
fred
had
always
lived
here
and
young
akers
had
heard
some
way
that
minafer
used
to
be
an
old
family
name
here
and
was
sort
of
curious
about
it
well
sir
you
remember
this
young
georgie
sort
of
disappeared
after
his
grandfather
death
and
nobody
seemed
to
know
much
what
had
become
of
him
though
i
did
hear
once
or
twice
that
he
was
still
around
somewhere
well
sir
he
working
for
the
akers
chemical
company
out
at
their
plant
on
the
thomasvile
he
paused
seeming
to
reserve
something
to
be
delivered
only
upon
inquiry
and
eugene
offered
him
the
expected
question
but
only
after
a
cold
glance
through
the
he
had
lately
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
what
does
he
do
kinney
laughed
and
slapped
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
a
nitroglycerin
expert
he
was
gratified
to
see
that
eugene
was
surprised
if
not
indeed
a
little
startled
he
what
he
an
expert
on
nitroglycerin
does
that
beat
the
devil
yes
sir
young
akers
told
fred
that
this
george
minafer
had
worked
like
a
ever
since
he
got
started
out
at
the
works
they
have
a
special
plant
for
nitroglycerin
way
off
from
the
main
plant
course
in
the
woods
somewhere
and
george
minafer
been
working
there
and
lately
they
put
him
in
charge
of
it
he
oversees
shooting
too
and
shoots
himself
sometimes
they
are
allowed
to
carry
it
on
the
railroads
you
know
have
to
team
it
young
akers
says
george
rides
around
over
the
bumpy
roads
sitting
on
as
much
as
three
hundred
quarts
of
nitroglycerin
my
lord
talk
about
romantic
tumbles
if
he
gets
blown
some
day
he
wo
have
a
bigger
drop
when
he
comes
down
than
he
already
had
do
it
beat
the
devil
young
akers
said
he
got
all
the
nerve
there
is
in
the
world
well
he
always
did
have
plenty
of
that
from
the
time
he
used
to
ride
around
here
on
his
white
pony
and
fight
all
the
irish
boys
in
with
his
long
curls
all
handy
to
be
pulled
out
akers
says
he
gets
a
fair
salary
and
i
should
think
he
ought
to
seems
to
me
i
heard
the
average
life
in
that
sort
of
work
is
somewhere
around
four
years
and
agents
do
write
any
insurance
at
all
for
nitroglycerin
experts
hardly
no
said
eugene
i
suppose
kinney
rose
to
go
well
it
a
pretty
funny
thing
pretty
odd
i
mean
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
for
old
fanny
minafer
if
he
blew
up
fred
told
me
that
they
living
in
some
apartment
house
and
said
georgie
supports
her
he
was
going
to
study
law
but
could
earn
enough
that
way
to
take
care
of
fanny
so
he
gave
it
up
fred
wife
told
him
all
this
says
fanny
does
do
anything
but
play
bridge
these
days
got
to
playing
too
high
for
awhile
and
lost
more
than
she
wanted
to
tell
georgie
about
and
borrowed
a
little
from
old
frank
bronson
paid
him
back
though
do
know
how
fred
wife
heard
it
women
do
hear
the
darndest
things
they
do
eugene
agreed
i
thought
you
probably
heard
about
it
thought
most
likely
wife
might
have
said
something
to
your
daughter
especially
as
i
think
well
i
off
to
the
store
said
kinney
briskly
yet
he
lingered
i
suppose
we
all
have
to
club
in
and
keep
old
fanny
out
of
the
poorhouse
if
he
does
blow
up
from
all
i
hear
it
usually
only
a
question
of
time
they
say
she
has
got
anything
else
to
depend
i
suppose
well
i
wondered
kinney
hesitated
i
was
wondering
why
you
thought
of
finding
something
around
your
works
for
him
they
say
an
worker
and
he
certainly
does
seem
to
have
hid
some
decent
stuff
in
him
under
all
his
damfoolishness
and
you
used
to
be
such
a
tremendous
friend
of
the
family
i
thought
perhaps
you
of
course
i
know
he
a
queer
lot
i
know
yes
i
think
he
is
said
eugene
no
i
have
anything
to
offer
i
suppose
not
kinney
returned
thoughtfully
as
he
went
out
i
know
that
i
would
myself
well
we
probably
see
his
name
in
the
papers
some
day
if
he
stays
with
that
job
however
the
nitroglycerin
expert
of
whom
they
spoke
did
not
get
into
the
papers
as
a
consequence
of
being
blown
up
although
his
daily
life
was
certainly
a
continuous
exposure
to
that
risk
destiny
has
a
constant
passion
for
the
incongruous
and
it
was
george
lot
to
manipulate
wholesale
quantities
of
terrific
and
volatile
explosives
in
safety
and
to
be
laid
low
by
an
accident
so
commonplace
and
inconsequent
that
it
was
a
comedy
fate
had
reserved
for
him
the
final
insult
of
riding
him
down
under
the
wheels
of
one
of
those
juggernauts
at
which
he
had
once
shouted
git
a
hoss
nevertheless
fate
ironic
choice
for
undoing
was
not
a
big
and
swift
and
momentous
car
such
as
eugene
manufactured
it
was
a
specimen
of
the
hustling
little
type
that
was
flooding
the
country
the
cheapest
commonest
hardiest
little
car
ever
made
the
accident
took
place
upon
a
sunday
morning
on
a
downtown
crossing
with
the
streets
almost
empty
and
no
reason
in
the
world
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
he
had
gone
out
for
his
sunday
morning
walk
and
he
was
thinking
of
an
automobile
at
the
very
moment
when
the
little
car
struck
him
he
was
thinking
of
a
shiny
landaulet
and
a
charming
figure
stepping
into
it
and
of
the
quick
gesture
of
a
white
glove
toward
the
chauffeur
motioning
him
to
go
on
george
heard
a
shout
but
did
not
look
up
for
he
could
not
imagine
anybody
shouting
at
him
and
he
was
too
engrossed
in
the
question
was
it
lucy
he
could
not
decide
and
his
lack
of
decision
in
this
matter
probably
superinduced
a
lack
of
decision
in
another
more
pressingly
vital
at
the
second
and
louder
shout
he
did
look
up
and
the
car
was
almost
on
him
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
if
the
charming
little
figure
he
had
seen
was
lucy
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
go
backward
or
forward
these
questions
became
entangled
in
his
mind
then
still
not
being
able
to
decide
which
of
two
ways
to
go
he
tried
to
go
both
and
the
little
car
ran
him
down
it
was
not
moving
very
rapidly
but
it
went
all
the
way
over
george
he
was
conscious
of
gigantic
violence
of
roaring
and
jolting
and
concussion
of
choking
clouds
of
dust
shot
with
lightning
about
his
head
he
heard
snapping
sounds
as
loud
as
shots
from
a
small
pistol
and
was
stabbed
by
excruciating
pains
in
his
legs
then
he
became
aware
that
the
machine
was
being
lifted
off
of
him
people
were
gathering
in
a
circle
round
him
gabbling
his
forehead
was
bedewed
with
the
sweat
of
anguish
and
he
tried
to
wipe
off
this
dampness
but
failed
he
could
not
get
his
arm
that
far
nev
mind
a
policeman
said
and
george
could
see
above
his
eyes
the
skirts
of
the
blue
coat
covered
with
dust
and
sunshine
be
here
in
a
minute
nev
mind
tryin
to
move
any
you
want
to
send
for
some
special
doctor
george
lips
formed
the
word
or
to
take
you
to
some
private
hospital
tell
them
to
take
me
he
said
faintly
to
the
city
a
a
smallish
young
man
in
a
duster
fidgeted
among
the
crowd
explaining
and
protesting
and
a
strident
voiced
girl
his
companion
supported
his
argument
declaring
to
everyone
her
willingness
to
offer
testimony
in
any
court
of
law
that
every
blessed
word
he
said
was
the
god
truth
it
the
fella
that
hit
you
the
policeman
said
looking
down
on
george
i
guess
he
right
you
must
of
been
thinkin
about
or
other
it
wunnerful
the
damage
them
little
machines
can
do
never
think
it
but
i
guess
they
ai
much
case
this
fella
that
was
drivin
you
bet
your
life
they
ai
no
case
on
me
the
young
man
in
the
duster
agreed
with
great
bitterness
he
came
and
stood
at
feet
addressing
him
heatedly
i
sorry
fer
you
all
right
and
i
say
i
ai
i
hold
nothin
against
you
but
it
was
any
more
my
fault
than
the
statehouse
you
run
into
me
much
as
i
run
into
you
and
if
you
get
well
you
ai
goin
to
get
not
one
single
cent
out
o
me
this
lady
here
was
settin
with
me
and
we
both
yelled
at
you
was
goin
a
step
over
eight
mile
an
hour
i
perfectly
willing
to
say
i
sorry
for
you
though
and
so
the
lady
with
me
we
both
willing
to
say
that
much
but
that
all
understand
george
drawn
eyelids
twitched
his
misted
glance
rested
fleetingly
upon
the
two
protesting
motorists
and
the
old
imperious
spirit
within
him
flickered
up
in
a
single
word
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
street
where
he
was
regarded
as
an
increasing
public
as
an
unpleasant
curiosity
he
spoke
this
word
clearly
from
a
mouth
filled
with
dust
and
from
lips
smeared
with
blood
it
was
a
word
which
interested
the
policeman
when
the
ambulance
clanged
away
he
turned
to
a
fellow
patrolman
who
had
joined
him
funny
what
he
says
to
the
little
cuss
that
done
the
damage
that
all
he
did
call
him
else
at
all
and
the
cuss
had
broke
both
his
legs
fer
him
and
i
was
here
then
what
was
it
riffraff
chapter
xxxv
eugene
feeling
about
george
had
not
been
altered
by
his
talk
with
kinney
in
the
club
window
though
he
was
somewhat
disturbed
he
was
not
disturbed
by
kinney
hint
that
fanny
minafer
might
be
left
on
the
hands
of
her
friends
through
her
nephew
present
dealings
with
nitroglycerin
but
he
was
surprised
that
kinney
had
led
up
with
intentional
tact
to
the
suggestion
that
a
position
might
be
made
for
george
in
the
morgan
factory
eugene
did
not
care
to
have
any
suggestions
about
georgie
minafer
made
to
him
kinney
had
represented
georgie
as
a
new
georgie
at
least
in
spots
a
georgie
who
was
proving
that
decent
stuff
had
been
hid
in
him
in
fact
a
georgie
who
was
doing
rather
a
handsome
thing
in
taking
a
risky
job
for
the
sake
of
his
aunt
poor
old
silly
fanny
minafer
eugene
did
care
what
risks
georgie
took
or
how
much
decent
stuff
he
had
in
him
nothing
that
georgie
would
ever
do
in
this
world
or
the
next
could
change
eugene
morgan
feeling
toward
him
if
eugene
could
possibly
have
brought
himself
to
offer
georgie
a
position
in
the
automobile
business
he
knew
full
well
the
proud
devil
would
have
taken
it
from
him
though
georgie
proud
reason
would
not
have
been
the
one
attributed
to
him
by
eugene
george
would
never
reach
the
point
where
he
could
accept
anything
material
from
eugene
and
preserve
the
he
had
begun
to
regain
but
if
eugene
had
wished
he
could
easily
have
taken
george
out
of
the
nitroglycerin
branch
of
the
chemical
works
always
interested
in
apparent
impossibilities
of
invention
eugene
had
encouraged
many
experiments
in
such
gropings
as
those
for
the
discovery
of
substitutes
for
gasoline
and
rubber
and
though
his
mood
had
withheld
the
information
from
kinney
he
had
recently
bought
from
the
elder
akers
a
substantial
quantity
of
stock
on
the
condition
that
the
chemical
company
should
establish
an
experimental
laboratory
he
intended
to
buy
more
akers
was
anxious
to
please
him
and
a
word
from
eugene
would
have
placed
george
almost
anywhere
in
the
chemical
works
george
need
never
have
known
it
for
eugene
purchases
of
stock
were
always
quiet
ones
the
transaction
remained
so
far
between
him
and
akers
and
could
be
kept
between
them
the
possibility
just
edged
itself
into
eugene
mind
that
is
he
let
it
become
part
of
his
perceptions
long
enough
for
it
to
prove
to
him
that
it
was
actually
a
possibility
then
he
half
started
with
disgust
that
he
should
be
even
idly
considering
such
a
thing
over
his
last
cigar
for
the
night
in
his
library
no
and
he
threw
the
cigar
into
the
empty
fireplace
and
went
to
bed
his
bitterness
for
himself
might
have
worn
away
but
never
his
bitterness
for
isabel
he
took
that
thought
to
bed
with
him
and
it
was
true
that
nothing
george
could
do
would
ever
change
this
bitterness
of
eugene
only
george
mother
could
have
changed
it
and
as
eugene
fell
asleep
that
night
thinking
thus
bitterly
of
georgie
georgie
in
the
hospital
was
thinking
of
eugene
he
had
come
out
of
ether
with
no
great
nausea
and
had
fallen
into
a
reverie
though
now
and
then
a
white
sailboat
staggered
foolishly
into
the
small
ward
where
he
lay
after
a
time
he
discovered
that
this
happened
only
when
he
tried
to
open
his
eyes
and
look
about
him
so
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
and
his
thoughts
were
clearer
he
thought
of
eugene
morgan
and
of
the
major
they
seemed
to
be
the
same
person
for
awhile
but
he
managed
to
disentangle
them
and
even
to
understand
why
he
had
confused
them
long
ago
his
grandfather
had
been
the
most
striking
figure
of
success
in
the
town
as
rich
as
major
amberson
they
used
to
say
now
it
was
eugene
if
i
had
eugene
morgan
money
he
would
hear
the
workmen
at
the
chemical
works
or
if
eugene
morgan
had
hold
of
this
place
you
see
things
hum
and
the
boarders
at
the
table
spoke
of
the
morgan
place
as
an
frenchman
spoke
of
versailles
like
his
uncle
george
had
perceived
that
the
morgan
place
was
the
new
amberson
mansion
his
reverie
went
back
to
the
palatial
days
of
the
mansion
in
his
boyhood
when
he
would
gallop
his
pony
up
the
driveway
and
order
the
darkey
about
while
they
whooped
and
obeyed
and
his
grandfather
observing
from
a
window
would
laugh
and
call
out
to
him
that
right
georgie
make
those
lazy
rascals
jump
he
remembered
his
gay
young
uncles
and
how
the
town
was
eager
concerning
everything
about
them
and
about
himself
what
a
clean
pretty
town
it
had
been
and
in
his
reverie
be
saw
like
a
pageant
before
him
the
magnificence
of
the
ambersons
its
passing
and
the
passing
of
the
ambersons
themselves
they
had
been
slowly
engulfed
without
knowing
how
to
prevent
it
and
almost
without
knowing
what
was
happening
to
them
the
family
lot
in
the
shabby
older
quarter
out
at
the
cemetery
held
most
of
them
now
and
the
name
was
swept
altogether
from
the
new
city
but
the
new
great
people
who
had
taken
their
places
the
morgans
and
akerses
and
sheridans
they
would
go
too
george
saw
that
they
would
pass
as
the
ambersons
had
passed
and
though
some
of
them
might
do
better
than
the
major
and
leave
the
letters
that
spelled
a
name
on
a
hospital
or
a
street
it
would
be
only
a
word
and
it
would
not
stay
forever
nothing
stays
or
holds
or
keeps
where
there
is
growth
he
somehow
perceived
vaguely
but
truly
great
caesar
dead
and
turned
to
clay
stopped
no
hole
to
keep
the
wind
away
dead
caesar
was
nothing
but
a
tiresome
bit
of
print
in
a
book
that
schoolboys
study
for
awhile
and
then
forget
the
ambersons
had
passed
and
the
new
people
would
pass
and
the
new
people
that
came
after
them
and
then
the
next
new
ones
and
the
next
and
the
next
he
had
begun
to
murmur
and
the
man
on
duty
as
night
nurse
for
the
ward
came
and
bent
over
him
did
you
want
something
there
nothing
in
this
family
business
george
told
him
confidentially
even
george
washington
is
only
something
in
a
eugene
read
a
report
of
the
accident
in
the
next
morning
paper
he
was
on
the
train
having
just
left
for
new
york
on
business
and
with
less
leisure
would
probably
have
overlooked
the
obscure
item
legs
broken
minafer
an
employee
of
the
akers
chemical
was
run
down
by
an
automobile
yesterday
at
the
corner
of
tennessee
and
main
and
had
both
legs
broken
minafer
was
to
blame
for
the
accident
according
to
patrolman
kax
who
witnessed
the
affair
the
automobile
was
a
small
one
driven
by
herbert
cottleman
of
noble
avenue
who
stated
that
he
was
making
less
than
miles
an
hour
minafer
is
said
to
belong
to
a
family
formerly
of
considerable
prominence
in
the
city
he
was
taken
to
the
city
hospital
where
physicians
stated
later
that
he
was
suffering
from
internal
injuries
besides
the
fracture
of
his
legs
but
might
recover
eugene
read
the
item
twice
then
tossed
the
paper
upon
the
opposite
seat
of
his
compartment
and
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
his
feeling
toward
georgie
was
changed
not
a
jot
by
his
human
pity
for
human
pain
and
injury
he
thought
of
georgie
tall
and
graceful
figure
and
he
shivered
but
his
bitterness
was
untouched
he
had
never
blamed
isabel
for
the
weakness
which
had
cost
them
the
few
years
of
happiness
they
might
have
had
together
he
had
put
the
blame
all
on
the
son
and
it
stayed
there
he
began
to
think
poignantly
of
isabel
he
had
seldom
been
able
to
see
her
more
clearly
than
as
he
sat
looking
out
of
his
compartment
window
after
reading
the
account
of
this
accident
she
might
have
been
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
looking
in
at
him
and
then
he
thought
of
her
as
the
pale
figure
of
a
woman
seen
yet
unseen
flying
through
the
air
beside
the
train
over
the
fields
of
springtime
green
and
through
the
woods
that
were
just
sprouting
out
their
little
leaves
he
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
her
as
she
had
been
long
ago
he
saw
the
proud
gentle
laughing
girl
he
had
known
when
first
he
came
to
town
a
boy
just
out
of
the
state
college
he
remembered
as
he
had
remembered
ten
thousand
times
before
the
look
she
gave
him
when
her
brother
george
introduced
him
to
her
at
a
picnic
it
was
like
hazel
starlight
he
had
written
her
in
a
poem
afterward
he
remembered
his
first
call
at
the
amberson
mansion
and
what
a
great
personage
she
seemed
at
home
in
that
magnificence
and
yet
so
gay
and
friendly
he
remembered
the
first
time
he
had
danced
with
her
and
the
old
waltz
song
began
to
beat
in
his
ears
and
in
his
heart
they
laughed
and
sang
it
together
as
they
danced
to
it
oh
love
for
a
year
a
week
a
day
but
alas
for
the
love
that
lasts
always
most
plainly
of
all
he
could
see
her
dancing
and
he
became
articulate
in
the
mourning
whisper
so
graceful
oh
so
graceful
all
the
way
to
new
york
it
seemed
to
him
that
isabel
was
near
him
and
he
wrote
of
her
to
lucy
from
his
hotel
the
next
night
i
saw
an
account
of
the
accident
to
george
minafer
i
sorry
though
the
paper
states
that
it
was
plainly
his
own
fault
i
suppose
it
may
have
been
as
a
result
of
my
attention
falling
upon
the
item
that
i
thought
of
his
mother
a
great
deal
on
the
way
here
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
her
more
distinctly
or
so
constantly
but
as
you
know
thinking
of
his
mother
is
not
very
apt
to
make
me
admire
him
of
course
however
he
has
my
best
wishes
for
his
recovery
he
posted
the
letter
and
by
the
morning
mail
he
received
one
from
lucy
written
a
few
hours
after
his
departure
from
home
she
enclosed
the
item
he
had
read
on
the
train
i
thought
you
might
not
see
it
i
have
seen
miss
fanny
and
she
has
got
him
put
into
a
room
by
himself
oh
poor
i
have
been
thinking
so
constantly
of
his
mother
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
have
never
seen
her
more
distinctly
how
lovely
she
was
and
how
she
loved
him
if
lucy
had
not
written
this
letter
eugene
might
not
have
done
the
odd
thing
he
did
that
day
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
that
both
he
and
lucy
should
have
thought
intently
of
isabel
after
reading
the
account
of
george
accident
but
the
fact
that
lucy
letter
had
crossed
his
own
made
eugene
begin
to
wonder
if
a
phenomenon
of
telepathy
might
not
be
in
question
rather
than
a
chance
coincidence
the
reference
to
isabel
in
the
two
letters
was
almost
identical
he
and
lucy
it
appeared
had
been
thinking
of
isabel
at
the
same
time
both
said
constantly
thinking
of
her
and
neither
had
ever
seen
her
more
he
remembered
these
phrases
in
his
own
letter
accurately
reflection
upon
the
circumstance
stirred
a
queer
spot
in
brain
he
had
one
he
was
an
adventurer
if
he
had
lived
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
would
have
sailed
the
unknown
new
seas
but
having
been
born
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
when
geography
was
a
fairly
matter
he
had
become
an
explorer
in
mechanics
but
the
fact
that
he
was
a
business
man
as
well
as
an
adventurer
did
not
keep
him
from
having
a
queer
spot
in
his
brain
because
business
men
are
as
susceptible
to
such
spots
as
adventurers
are
some
of
them
are
secretly
troubled
when
they
do
not
see
the
new
moon
over
the
lucky
shoulder
some
of
them
have
strange
secret
incredulities
they
do
not
believe
in
geology
for
instance
and
some
of
them
think
they
have
had
supernatural
experiences
of
course
there
was
nothing
in
it
still
it
was
queer
they
say
two
weeks
after
isabel
death
eugene
had
come
to
new
york
on
urgent
business
and
found
that
the
delayed
arrival
of
a
steamer
gave
him
a
day
with
nothing
to
do
his
room
at
the
hotel
had
become
intolerable
outdoors
was
intolerable
everything
was
intolerable
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
see
isabel
once
more
hear
her
voice
once
more
that
he
must
find
some
way
to
her
or
lose
his
mind
under
this
pressure
he
had
gone
with
complete
scepticism
to
a
of
whom
he
had
heard
wild
accounts
from
the
wife
of
a
business
acquaintance
he
thought
despairingly
that
at
least
such
an
excursion
would
be
trying
to
do
something
he
remembered
the
woman
name
found
it
in
the
telephone
book
and
made
an
appointment
the
experience
had
been
grotesque
and
he
came
away
with
an
encouraging
message
from
his
father
who
had
failed
to
identify
himself
satisfactorily
but
declared
that
everything
was
on
a
higher
plane
in
his
present
state
of
being
and
that
all
life
was
continuous
and
horner
spoke
of
herself
as
a
psychic
but
otherwise
she
seemed
oddly
unpretentious
and
and
eugene
had
no
doubt
at
all
of
her
sincerity
he
was
sure
that
she
was
not
an
intentional
fraud
and
though
he
departed
in
a
state
of
annoyance
with
himself
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
any
credulity
were
played
upon
by
horner
exhibitions
it
was
her
own
nevertheless
his
queer
spot
having
been
stimulated
to
action
by
the
coincidence
of
the
letters
he
went
to
horner
after
his
directors
meeting
today
he
used
the
telephone
booth
in
the
room
to
make
the
appointment
and
he
laughed
feebly
at
himself
and
wondered
what
the
group
of
men
in
that
mahogany
apartment
would
think
if
they
knew
what
he
was
doing
horner
had
changed
her
address
but
he
found
the
new
one
and
somebody
purporting
to
be
a
niece
of
hers
talked
to
him
and
made
an
appointment
for
a
sitting
at
five
he
was
prompt
and
the
niece
a
fat
girl
with
a
magazine
under
her
arm
admitted
him
to
horner
apartment
which
smelt
of
camphor
and
showed
him
into
a
room
with
gray
painted
walls
no
rug
on
the
floor
and
no
furniture
except
a
table
with
nothing
on
it
and
two
chairs
one
a
leather
and
the
other
a
stiff
little
brute
with
a
wooden
seat
there
was
one
window
with
the
shade
pulled
down
to
the
sill
but
the
sun
was
bright
outside
and
the
room
had
light
enough
horner
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
wan
and
unenterprising
looking
woman
in
brown
with
thin
hair
artificially
waved
but
not
recently
and
parted
in
the
middle
over
a
bluish
forehead
her
eyes
were
small
and
seemed
weak
but
she
recognized
the
visitor
oh
you
been
here
before
she
said
in
a
thin
voice
not
unmusical
i
recollect
you
quite
a
time
ago
it
yes
quite
a
long
i
recollect
because
i
recollect
you
was
disappointed
anyway
you
was
kind
of
she
laughed
faintly
i
sorry
if
i
seemed
so
eugene
said
do
you
happen
to
have
found
out
my
name
she
looked
surprised
and
a
little
reproachful
why
no
i
never
try
to
find
out
people
name
why
should
i
i
do
claim
anything
for
the
power
i
only
know
i
have
it
and
some
ways
it
ai
always
such
a
blessing
neither
i
can
tell
you
eugene
did
not
press
an
investigation
of
her
meaning
but
said
vaguely
i
suppose
not
shall
we
all
right
she
assented
dropping
into
the
leather
chair
with
her
back
to
the
shaded
window
you
better
set
down
too
i
reckon
i
hope
you
get
something
this
time
so
you
wo
feel
cross
but
i
dunno
i
ca
never
tell
what
they
do
well
she
sighed
closed
her
eyes
and
was
silent
while
eugene
seated
in
the
stiff
chair
across
the
table
from
her
watched
her
profile
thought
himself
an
idiot
and
called
himself
that
and
other
names
and
as
the
silence
continued
and
the
impassive
woman
in
the
remained
impassive
he
began
to
wonder
what
had
led
him
to
be
such
a
fool
it
became
clear
to
him
that
the
similarity
of
his
letter
and
lucy
needed
no
explanation
involving
telepathy
and
was
not
even
an
extraordinary
coincidence
what
then
had
brought
him
back
to
this
absurd
place
and
caused
him
to
be
watching
this
absurd
woman
taking
a
nap
in
a
chair
in
brief
what
the
devil
did
he
mean
by
it
he
had
not
the
slightest
interest
in
horner
naps
or
in
her
teeth
which
were
being
slightly
revealed
by
the
unconscious
parting
of
her
lips
as
her
breathing
became
heavier
if
the
vagaries
of
his
own
mind
had
brought
him
into
such
a
grotesquerie
as
this
into
what
did
the
vagaries
of
other
men
minds
take
them
confident
that
he
was
ordinarily
saner
than
most
people
he
perceived
that
since
he
was
capable
of
doing
a
thing
like
this
other
men
did
even
more
idiotic
things
in
secret
and
he
had
a
fleeting
vision
of
bankers
and
manufacturers
and
lawyers
men
sound
citizens
and
all
as
queer
as
the
deuce
inside
how
long
was
he
going
to
sit
here
presiding
over
this
unknown
slumbers
it
struck
him
that
to
make
the
picture
complete
he
ought
to
be
shooing
flies
away
from
her
with
a
fan
horner
parted
lips
closed
again
abruptly
and
became
compressed
her
shoulders
moved
a
little
then
jerked
repeatedly
her
small
chest
heaved
she
gasped
and
the
compressed
lips
relaxed
to
a
slight
contortion
then
began
to
move
whispering
and
bringing
forth
indistinguishable
mutterings
suddenly
she
spoke
in
a
loud
husky
voice
lopa
is
here
yes
eugene
said
dryly
that
what
you
said
last
time
i
remember
she
your
i
think

i
lopa
said
the
husky
voice
i
lopa
you
mean
i
to
suppose
you
not
horner
now
never
was
horner
the
voice
declared
speaking
undeniably
from
horner
lips
but
with
such
conviction
that
eugene
in
spite
of
everything
began
to
feel
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
third
party
who
was
none
the
less
an
individual
even
though
she
might
be
another
edition
of
the
apparently
somnambulistic
horner
never
was
horner
or
anybody
but
just
lopa
you
mean
you
horner
guide
he
asked
your
guide
now
said
the
voice
with
emphasis
to
which
was
incongruously
added
a
low
laugh
you
came
here
once
before
lopa
yes
so
did
lopa
overlooked
his
implication
and
continued
quickly
you
build
build
things
that
go
you
came
here
once
and
old
gentleman
on
this
side
he
spoke
to
you

says

but

says

hair

fond

is
someone
who

very
well
but
she
is
not

she
is
very
anxious
to
say
something
to
you
very
anxious
very
fond
of
you
very
anxious
to
talk
to
you
very
glad
you
came
here
oh
very
glad
what
is
her
name
name
the
voice
repeated
and
seemed
to
ruminate
name
hard
to
get
always
very
hard
for
lopa
name
she
wants
to
tell
me
her
name
to
tell
you
she
wants
you
to
understand
names
are
hard
to
make
she
says
you
must
think
of
something
that
makes
a
here
the
voice
seemed
to
put
a
question
to
an
invisible
presence
and
to
receive
an
answer
a
little
sound
or
a
big
sound
she
says
it
might
be
a
little
sound
or
a
big
sound
she
says
a
ring
oh
lopa
knows
she
means
a
bell
that
it
a
eugene
looked
grave
does
she
mean
her
name
is
belle
not
quite
her
name
is
perhaps
he
suggested
she
means
that
she
was
a
no
she
says
she
thinks
you
know
what
she
means
she
says
you
must
think
of
a
colour
what
colour
again
lopa
addressed
the
unknown
but
this
time
seemed
to
wait
for
an
answer
perhaps
she
means
the
colour
of
her
eyes
said
eugene
no
she
says
her
colour
is
light
it
a
light
colour
and
you
can
see
through
amber
he
said
and
was
startled
for
horner
with
her
eyes
still
closed
clapped
her
hands
and
the
voice
cried
out
in
delight
yes
she
says
you
know
who
she
is
from
amber
amber
amber
that
it
she
says
you
understand
what
her
name
is
from
a
bell
and
from
amber
she
is
laughing
and
waving
a
lace
handkerchief
at
me
because
she
is
pleased
she
says
i
have
made
you
know
who
it
this
was
the
strangest
moment
of
eugene
life
because
while
it
lasted
he
believed
that
isabel
amberson
who
was
dead
had
found
means
to
speak
to
him
though
within
ten
minutes
he
doubted
it
he
believed
it
then
his
elbows
pressed
hard
upon
the
table
and
his
head
between
his
hands
he
leaned
forward
staring
at
the
commonplace
figure
in
the
what
does
she
wish
to
say
to
me
she
is
happy
because
you
know
her
no
she
is
troubled
oh
a
great
trouble
something
she
wants
to
tell
you
she
wants
so
much
to
tell
you
she
wants
lopa
to
tell
you
this
is
a
great
trouble
she
says
oh
yes
she
wants
you
to
be
to
be
kind
that
what
she
says
that
it
to
be
does
she
she
wants
you
to
be
kind
said
the
voice
she
nods
when
i
tell
you
this
yes
it
must
be
right
she
is
a
very
fine
lady
very
pretty
she
is
so
anxious
for
you
to
understand
she
hopes
and
hopes
you
will
someone
else
wants
to
speak
to
you
this
is
a
man
he
says
i
do
want
to
speak
to
any
one
else
said
eugene
quickly
i
want
this
man
who
has
come
says
that
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
he
says
eugene
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
i
do
want
to
speak
to
any
one
else
i
tell
you
he
cried
passionately
if
she
is
there
i
he
caught
his
breath
sharply
checked
himself
and
sat
in
amazement
could
his
mind
so
easily
accept
so
stupendous
a
thing
as
true
evidently
it
could
horner
spoke
languidly
in
her
own
voice
did
you
get
anything
satisfactory
she
asked
i
certainly
hope
it
was
like
that
other
time
when
you
was
cross
because
they
could
get
anything
for
no
no
he
said
hastily
this
was
different
it
was
very
he
paid
her
went
to
his
hotel
and
thence
to
his
train
for
home
never
did
he
so
seem
to
move
through
a
world
of
for
he
knew
that
he
was
not
more
credulous
than
other
men
and
if
he
could
believe
what
he
had
believed
though
he
had
believed
it
for
no
longer
than
a
moment
or
two
what
hold
had
he
or
any
other
human
being
on
reality
his
credulity
vanished
or
so
he
thought
with
his
recollection
that
it
was
he
and
not
the
alleged
lopa
who
had
suggested
the
word
going
over
the
mortifying
plain
facts
of
his
experience
he
found
that
horner
or
the
subdivision
of
horner
known
as
lopa
had
told
him
to
think
of
a
bell
and
of
a
colour
and
that
being
furnished
with
these
scientific
data
he
had
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
spoke
with
isabel
amberson
for
a
moment
he
had
believed
that
isabel
was
there
believed
that
she
was
close
to
him
entreating
him
entreating
him
to
be
but
with
this
recollection
a
strange
agitation
came
upon
him
after
all
had
she
not
spoken
to
him
if
his
own
unknown
consciousness
had
told
the
psychic
unknown
consciousness
how
to
make
the
picture
of
the
pretty
lady
had
the
picture
been
a
true
one
and
had
the
true
isabel
oh
indeed
her
very
soul
called
to
him
out
of
his
own
true
memory
of
her
and
as
the
train
roared
through
the
darkened
evening
he
looked
out
beyond
his
window
and
saw
her
as
he
had
seen
her
on
his
journey
a
few
days
ago
an
ethereal
figure
flying
beside
the
train
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
kept
her
face
toward
his
window
with
an
infinite
wistfulness
to
be
kind
if
it
had
been
isabel
was
that
what
she
would
have
said
if
she
were
anywhere
and
could
come
to
him
through
the
invisible
wall
what
would
be
the
first
thing
she
would
say
to
him
ah
well
enough
and
perhaps
bitterly
enough
he
knew
the
answer
to
that
question
to
be
kind
to
georgie
a
at
the
station
when
he
arrived
leaped
for
his
bag
abandoning
another
which
the
pullman
porter
had
handed
him
yessuh
mist
morgan
yessuh
you
car
waitin
front
the
station
fer
you
morgan
suh
and
people
in
the
crowd
about
the
gates
turned
to
stare
as
he
passed
through
whispering
that
outside
the
neat
chauffeur
stood
at
the
door
of
the
like
a
soldier
in
i
not
go
home
now
harry
said
eugene
when
he
had
got
in
drive
to
the
city
yes
sir
the
man
returned
miss
lucy
there
she
said
she
expected
you
come
there
before
you
went
she
did
yes
eugene
stared
i
suppose
minafer
must
be
pretty
bad
he
said
yes
sir
i
understand
he
liable
to
get
well
though
he
moved
his
lever
into
high
speed
and
the
car
went
through
the
heavy
traffic
like
some
fast
faithful
beast
that
knew
its
way
about
and
knew
its
master
need
of
haste
eugene
did
not
speak
again
until
they
reached
the
hospital
fanny
met
him
in
the
upper
corridor
and
took
him
to
an
open
door
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
startled
for
from
the
waxen
face
on
the
pillow
almost
it
seemed
the
eyes
of
isabel
herself
were
looking
at
him
never
before
had
the
resemblance
between
mother
and
son
been
so
strong
and
eugene
knew
that
now
he
had
once
seen
it
thus
startlingly
he
need
divest
himself
of
no
bitterness
to
be
kind
to
georgie
george
was
startled
too
he
lifted
a
white
hand
in
a
queer
gesture
half
forbidding
half
imploring
and
then
let
his
arm
fall
back
upon
the
coverlet
you
must
have
thought
my
mother
wanted
you
to
come
he
said
so
that
i
could
ask
you
to
to
forgive
but
lucy
who
sat
beside
him
lifted
ineffable
eyes
from
him
to
her
father
and
shook
her
head
no
just
to
take
his
hand
gently
she
was
radiant
but
for
eugene
another
radiance
filled
the
room
he
knew
that
he
had
been
true
at
last
to
his
true
love
and
that
through
him
she
had
brought
her
boy
under
shelter
again
her
eyes
would
look
wistful
no
more
the
end
