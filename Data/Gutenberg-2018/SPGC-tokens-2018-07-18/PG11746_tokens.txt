preface
this
is
an
account
of
a
reconnaissance
through
the
brazilian
hinterland
the
official
and
proper
title
of
the
expedition
is
that
given
it
by
the
brazilian
government
expedicao
scientifica
rondon
when
i
started
from
the
united
states
it
was
to
make
an
expedition
primarily
concerned
with
mammalogy
and
ornithology
for
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
of
new
york
this
was
undertaken
under
the
auspices
of
osborn
and
chapman
acting
on
behalf
of
the
museum
in
the
body
of
this
work
i
describe
how
the
scope
of
the
expedition
was
enlarged
and
how
it
was
given
a
geographic
as
well
as
a
zoological
character
in
consequence
of
the
kind
proposal
of
the
brazilian
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
general
lauro
muller
in
its
altered
and
enlarged
form
the
expedition
was
rendered
possible
only
by
the
generous
assistance
of
the
brazilian
government
throughout
the
body
of
the
work
will
be
found
reference
after
reference
to
my
colleagues
and
companions
of
the
expedition
whose
services
to
science
i
have
endeavored
to
set
forth
and
for
whom
i
shall
always
feel
the
most
cordial
friendship
and
regard

i
the
start
one
day
in
when
my
presidential
term
was
coming
to
a
close
father
zahm
a
priest
whom
i
knew
came
in
to
call
on
me
father
zahm
and
i
had
been
cronies
for
some
time
because
we
were
both
of
us
fond
of
dante
and
of
history
and
of
science
i
had
always
commended
to
theologians
his
book
evolution
and
dogma
he
was
an
ohio
boy
and
his
early
schooling
had
been
obtained
in
american
fashion
in
a
little
log
school
where
by
the
way
one
of
the
other
boys
was
januarius
aloysius
macgahan
afterward
the
famous
war
correspondent
and
friend
of
skobeloff
father
zahm
told
me
that
macgahan
even
at
that
time
added
an
utter
fearlessness
to
chivalric
tenderness
for
the
weak
and
was
the
defender
of
any
small
boy
who
was
oppressed
by
a
larger
one
later
father
zahm
was
at
notre
dame
university
in
indiana
with
maurice
egan
whom
when
i
was
president
i
appointed
minister
to
denmark
on
the
occasion
in
question
father
zahm
had
just
returned
from
a
trip
across
the
andes
and
down
the
amazon
and
came
in
to
propose
that
after
i
left
the
presidency
he
and
i
should
go
up
the
paraguay
into
the
interior
of
south
america
at
the
time
i
wished
to
go
to
africa
and
so
the
subject
was
dropped
but
from
time
to
time
afterward
we
talked
it
over
five
years
later
in
the
spring
of
i
accepted
invitations
conveyed
through
the
governments
of
argentina
and
brazil
to
address
certain
learned
bodies
in
these
countries
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
instead
of
making
the
conventional
tourist
trip
purely
by
sea
round
south
america
after
i
had
finished
my
lectures
i
would
come
north
through
the
middle
of
the
continent
into
the
valley
of
the
amazon
and
i
decided
to
write
father
zahm
and
tell
him
my
intentions
before
doing
so
however
i
desired
to
see
the
authorities
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
in
new
york
city
to
find
out
whether
they
cared
to
have
me
take
a
couple
of
naturalists
with
me
into
brazil
and
make
a
collecting
trip
for
the
museum
accordingly
i
wrote
to
frank
chapman
the
curator
of
ornithology
of
the
museum
and
accepted
his
invitation
to
lunch
at
the
museum
one
day
early
in
june
at
the
lunch
in
addition
to
various
naturalists
to
my
astonishment
i
also
found
father
zahm
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
told
him
i
was
now
intending
to
make
the
south
american
trip
it
appeared
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
take
it
himself
and
had
actually
come
on
to
see
chapman
to
find
out
if
the
latter
could
recommend
a
naturalist
to
go
with
him
and
he
at
once
said
he
would
accompany
me
chapman
was
pleased
when
he
found
out
that
we
intended
to
go
up
the
paraguay
and
across
into
the
valley
of
the
amazon
because
much
of
the
ground
over
which
we
were
to
pass
had
not
been
covered
by
collectors
he
saw
henry
fairfield
osborn
the
president
of
the
museum
who
wrote
me
that
the
museum
would
be
pleased
to
send
under
me
a
couple
of
naturalists
whom
with
my
approval
chapman
would
choose
the
men
whom
chapman
recommended
were
george
cherrie
and
leo
miller
i
gladly
accepted
both
the
former
was
to
attend
chiefly
to
the
ornithology
and
the
latter
to
the
mammalogy
of
the
expedition
but
each
was
to
help
out
the
other
no
two
better
men
for
such
a
trip
could
have
been
found
both
were
veterans
of
the
tropical
american
forests
miller
was
a
young
man
born
in
indiana
an
enthusiastic
with
good
literary
as
well
as
scientific
training
he
was
at
the
time
in
the
guiana
forests
and
joined
us
at
barbados
cherrie
was
an
older
man
born
in
iowa
but
now
a
farmer
in
vermont
he
had
a
wife
and
six
children
cherrie
had
accompanied
him
during
two
or
three
years
of
their
early
married
life
in
his
collecting
trips
along
the
orinoco
their
second
child
was
born
when
they
were
in
camp
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
from
any
white
man
or
woman
one
night
a
few
weeks
later
they
were
obliged
to
leave
a
where
they
had
intended
to
spend
the
night
because
the
baby
was
fretful
and
its
cries
attracted
a
jaguar
which
prowled
nearer
and
nearer
in
the
twilight
until
they
thought
it
safest
once
more
to
put
out
into
the
open
river
and
seek
a
new
cherrie
had
spent
about
years
collecting
in
the
american
tropics
like
most
of
the
i
have
met
he
was
an
unusually
efficient
and
fearless
man
and
he
had
been
forced
at
times
to
vary
his
career
by
taking
part
in
insurrections
twice
he
had
been
behind
the
bars
in
consequence
on
one
occasion
spending
three
months
in
a
prison
of
a
certain
south
american
state
expecting
each
day
to
be
taken
out
and
shot
in
another
state
he
had
as
an
interlude
to
his
ornithological
pursuits
followed
the
career
of
a
acting
as
such
off
and
on
for
two
and
a
half
years
the
particular
revolutionary
chief
whose
fortunes
he
was
following
finally
came
into
power
and
cherrie
immortalized
his
name
by
naming
a
new
species
of
after
him
a
delightful
touch
in
its
practical
combination
of
those
not
normally
kindred
pursuits
ornithology
and
in
anthony
fiala
a
former
arctic
explorer
we
found
an
excellent
man
for
assembling
equipment
and
taking
charge
of
its
handling
and
shipment
in
addition
to
his
four
years
in
the
arctic
regions
fiala
had
served
in
the
new
york
squadron
in
porto
rico
during
the
spanish
war
and
through
his
service
in
the
squadron
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
his
little
tennessee
wife
she
came
down
with
her
four
children
to
say
to
him
when
the
steamer
left
my
secretary
frank
harper
went
with
us
jacob
sigg
who
had
served
three
years
in
the
united
states
army
and
was
both
a
hospital
nurse
and
a
cook
as
well
as
having
a
natural
taste
for
adventure
went
as
the
personal
attendant
of
father
zahm
in
southern
brazil
my
son
kermit
joined
me
he
had
been
bridge
building
and
a
couple
of
months
previously
while
on
top
of
a
long
steel
span
something
went
wrong
with
the
derrick
he
and
the
steel
span
coming
down
together
on
the
rocky
bed
beneath
he
escaped
with
two
broken
ribs
two
teeth
knocked
out
and
a
knee
partially
dislocated
but
was
practically
all
right
again
when
he
started
with
us
in
its
composition
ours
was
a
typical
american
expedition
kermit
and
i
were
of
the
old
revolutionary
stock
and
in
our
veins
ran
about
every
strain
of
blood
that
there
was
on
this
side
of
the
water
during
colonial
times
cherrie

was
born
in

while
i
belonged

shotguns
one
of
having
a

barrel
underneath
the
firearms
for
the
rest
of
the
party
were
supplied
by
kermit
and

two
winchesters
a
and
the
fox
shotgun
and
another
gun
and
a
couple
of
revolvers
a

we
took
from

york
a
couple
of
canvas
canoes
tents
plenty
of
cheesecloth
including
nets
for
the
hats
and
both
light
cots
and
hammocks
we
took
ropes
and
pulleys
which
proved
invaluable
on
our
canoe
trip
each
equipped
himself
with
the
clothing
he
fancied
mine
consisted
of
khaki
such
as
i
wore
in
africa
with
a
couple
of
united
states
army
flannel
shirts
and
a
couple
of
silk
shirts
one
pair
of
shoes
with
leggings
and
one
pair
of
laced
leather
boots
coming
nearly
to
the
knee
both
the
naturalists
told
me
that
it
was
well
to
have
either
the
boots
or
leggings
as
a
protection
against
and
i
also
had
gauntlets
because
of
the
mosquitoes
and
we
intended
where
possible
to
live
on
what
we
could
get
from
time
to
time
in
the
country
but
we
took
some
united
states
army
emergency
rations
and
also
ninety
cans
each
containing
a
day
provisions
for
five
men
made
up
by
fiala
the
trip
i
proposed
to
take
can
be
understood
only
if
there
is
a
slight
knowledge
of
south
american
topography
the
great
mountain
chain
of
the
andes
extends
down
the
entire
length
of
the
western
coast
so
close
to
the
pacific
ocean
that
no
rivers
of
any
importance
enter
it
the
rivers
of
south
america
drain
into
the
atlantic
southernmost
south
america
including
over
half
of
the
territory
of
the
argentine
republic
consists
chiefly
of
a
cool
open
plains
country
northward
of
this
country
and
eastward
of
the
andes
lies
the
great
bulk
of
the
south
american
continent
which
is
included
in
the
tropical
and
the
subtropical
regions
most
of
this
territory
is
brazilian
aside
from
certain
relatively
small
stretches
drained
by
coast
rivers
this
immense
region
of
tropical
and
subtropical
america
east
of
the
andes
is
drained
by
the
three
great
river
systems
of
the
plate
the
amazon
and
the
orinoco
at
their
headwaters
the
amazon
and
the
orinoco
systems
are
actually
connected
by
a
sluggish
natural
canal
the
headwaters
of
the
northern
affluents
of
the
paraguay
and
the
southern
affluents
of
the
amazon
are
sundered
by
a
stretch
of
high
land
which
toward
the
east
broadens
out
into
the
central
plateau
of
brazil
geologically
this
is
a
very
ancient
region
having
appeared
above
the
waters
before
the
dawning
of
the
age
of
reptiles
or
indeed
of
any
true
land
vertebrates
on
the
globe
this
plateau
is
a
region
partly
of
healthy
rather
dry
and
sandy
open
prairie
partly
of
forest
the
great
and
basin
of
the
paraguay
which
borders
it
on
the
south
is
one
of
the
largest
and
the
still
greater
basin
of
the
amazon
which
borders
it
on
the
north
is
the
very
largest
of
all
the
river
basins
of
the
earth
in
these
basins
but
especially
in
the
basin
of
the
amazon
and
thence
in
most
places
northward
to
the
caribbean
sea
lie
the
most
extensive
stretches
of
tropical
forest
to
be
found
anywhere
the
forests
of
tropical
west
africa
and
of
portions
of
the
region
are
the
only
ones
that
can
be
compared
with
them
much
difficulty
has
been
experienced
in
exploring
these
forests
because
under
the
torrential
rains
and
steaming
heat
the
rank
growth
of
vegetation
becomes
almost
impenetrable
and
the
streams
difficult
of
navigation
while
white
men
suffer
much
from
the
terrible
insect
scourges
and
the
deadly
diseases
which
modern
science
has
discovered
to
be
due
very
largely
to
insect
bites
the
fauna
and
flora
however
are
of
great
interest
the
american
museum
was
particularly
anxious
to
obtain
collections
from
the
divide
between
the
headwaters
of
the
paraguay
and
the
amazon
and
from
the
southern
affluents
of
the
amazon
our
purpose
was
to
ascend
the
paraguay
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
head
of
navigation
thence
cross
to
the
sources
of
one
of
the
affluents
of
the
amazon
and
if
possible
descend
it
in
canoes
built
on
the
spot
the
paraguay
is
regularly
navigated
as
high
as
boats
can
go
the
point
for
our
trip
was
to
be
asuncion
in
the
state
of
paraguay
my
exact
plan
of
operations
was
necessarily
a
little
indefinite
but
on
reaching
rio
de
janeiro
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
lauro
muller
who
had
been
kind
enough
to
take
great
personal
interest
in
my
trip
informed
me
that
he
had
arranged
that
on
the
headwaters
of
the
paraguay
at
the
town
of
caceres
i
would
be
met
by
a
brazilian
army
colonel
himself
chiefly
indian
by
blood
colonel
rondon
colonel
rondon
has
been
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
foremost
explorer
of
the
brazilian
hinterland
he
was
at
the
time
in
manaos
but
his
lieutenants
were
in
caceres
and
had
been
notified
that
we
were
coming
more
important
still
lauro
muller
who
is
not
only
an
efficient
public
servant
but
a
man
of
wide
cultivation
with
a
quality
about
him
that
reminded
me
of
john
hay
offered
to
help
me
make
my
trip
of
much
more
consequence
than
i
had
originally
intended
he
has
taken
a
keen
interest
in
the
exploration
and
development
of
the
interior
of
brazil
and
he
believed
that
my
expedition
could
be
used
as
a
means
toward
spreading
abroad
a
more
general
knowledge
of
the
country
he
told
me
that
he
would
with
me
in
every
way
if
i
cared
to
undertake
the
leadership
of
a
serious
expedition
into
the
unexplored
portion
of
western
matto
grosso
and
to
attempt
the
descent
of
a
river
which
flowed
nobody
knew
whither
but
which
the
men
believed
would
prove
to
be
a
very
big
river
utterly
unknown
to
geographers
i
eagerly
and
gladly
accepted
for
i
felt
that
with
such
help
the
trip
could
be
made
of
much
scientific
value
and
that
a
substantial
addition
could
be
made
to
the
geographical
knowledge
of
one
of
the
parts
of
south
america
accordingly
it
was
arranged
that
colonel
rondon
and
some
assistants
and
scientists
should
meet
me
at
or
below
corumba
and
that
we
should
attempt
the
descent
of
the
river
of
which
they
had
already
come
across
the
headwaters
i
had
to
travel
through
brazil
uruguay
the
argentine
and
chile
for
six
weeks
to
fulfil
my
speaking
engagements
fiala
cherrie
miller
and
sigg
left
me
at
rio
continuing
to
buenos
aires
in
the
boat
in
which
we
had
all
come
down
from
new
york
from
buenos
aires
they
went
up
the
paraguay
to
corumba
where
they
awaited
me
the
two
naturalists
went
first
to
do
all
the
collecting
that
was
possible
fiala
and
sigg
travelled
more
leisurely
with
the
heavy
baggage
before
i
followed
them
i
witnessed
an
incident
worthy
of
note
from
the
standpoint
of
a
naturalist
and
of
possible
importance
to
us
because
of
the
trip
we
were
about
to
take
south
america
even
more
than
australia
and
africa
and
almost
as
much
as
india
is
a
country
of
poisonous
snakes
as
in
india
although
not
to
the
same
degree
these
snakes
are
responsible
for
a
very
serious
mortality
among
human
beings
one
of
the
most
interesting
evidences
of
the
modern
advance
in
brazil
is
the
establishment
near
sao
paulo
of
an
institution
especially
for
the
study
of
these
poisonous
snakes
so
as
to
secure
antidotes
to
the
poison
and
to
develop
enemies
to
the
snakes
themselves
we
wished
to
take
into
the
interior
with
us
some
bottles
of
the
serum
for
on
such
an
expedition
there
is
always
a
certain
danger
from
snakes
on
one
of
his
trips
cherrie
had
lost
a
native
follower
by
the
man
was
bitten
while
out
alone
in
the
forest
and
although
he
reached
camp
the
poison
was
already
working
in
him
so
that
he
could
give
no
intelligible
account
of
what
had
occurred
and
he
died
in
a
short
time
poisonous
snakes
are
of
several
different
families
but
the
most
poisonous
ones
those
which
are
dangerous
to
man
belong
to
the
two
great
families
of
the
colubrine
snakes
and
the
vipers
most
of
the
colubrine
snakes
are
entirely
harmless
and
are
the
common
snakes
that
we
meet
everywhere
but
some
of
them
the
cobras
for
instance
develop
into
what
are
on
the
whole
perhaps
the
most
formidable
of
all
snakes
the
only
poisonous
colubrine
snakes
in
the
new
world
are
the
snakes
the
of
the
genus
elaps
which
are
found
from
the
extreme
southern
united
states
southward
to
the
argentine
these
are
not
vicious
and
have
small
teeth
which
can
not
penetrate
even
ordinary
clothing
they
are
only
dangerous
if
actually
trodden
on
by
some
one
with
bare
feet
or
if
seized
in
the
hand
there
are
harmless
snakes
very
like
them
in
color
which
are
sometimes
kept
as
pets
but
it
behooves
every
man
who
keeps
such
a
pet
or
who
handles
such
a
snake
to
be
very
sure
as
to
the
genus
to
which
it
belongs
the
great
bulk
of
the
poisonous
snakes
of
america
including
all
the
really
dangerous
ones
belong
to
a
division
of
the
widely
spread
family
of
vipers
which
is
known
as
the
in
south
america
these
include
two
distinct
subfamilies
or
genera
whether
they
are
called
families
subfamilies
or
genera
would
depend
i
suppose
largely
upon
the
varying
personal
views
of
the
individual
describer
on
the
subject
of
herpetological
nomenclature
one
genus
includes
the
rattlesnakes
of
which
the
big
brazilian
species
is
as
dangerous
as
those
of
the
southern
united
states
but
the
large
majority
of
the
species
and
individuals
of
dangerous
snakes
in
tropical
america
are
included
in
the
genus
lachecis
these
are
active
vicious
aggressive
snakes
without
rattles
they
are
exceedingly
poisonous
some
of
them
grow
to
a
very
large
size
being
indeed
among
the
largest
poisonous
snakes
in
the
world
their
only
rivals
in
this
respect
being
the
diamond
rattlesnake
of
florida
one
of
the
african
mambas
and
the
indian
hamadryad
or
cobra
the
so
dreaded
in
martinique
and
the
equally
dangerous
bushmaster
of
guiana
are
included
in
this
genus
a
dozen
species
are
known
in
brazil
the
biggest
one
being
identical
with
the
guiana
bushmaster
and
the
most
common
one
the
jararaca
being
identical
or
practically
identical
with
the
the
snakes
of
this
genus
like
the
rattlesnakes
and
the
old
world
vipers
and
possess
long
which
strike
through
clothes
or
any
other
human
garment
except
stout
leather
moreover
they
are
very
aggressive
more
so
than
any
other
snakes
in
the
world
except
possibly
some
of
the
cobras
as
in
addition
they
are
numerous
they
are
a
source
of
really
frightful
danger
to
scantily
clad
men
who
work
in
the
fields
and
forests
or
who
for
any
reason
are
abroad
at
night
the
poison
of
venomous
serpents
is
not
in
the
least
uniform
in
its
quality
on
the
contrary
the
natural
forces
to
use
a
term
which
is
vague
but
which
is
as
exact
as
our
knowledge
permits
that
have
developed
in
so
many
different
families
of
snakes
these
poisoned
fangs
have
worked
in
two
or
three
totally
different
fashions
unlike
the
vipers
the
colubrine
poisonous
snakes
have
small
fangs
and
their
poison
though
on
the
whole
even
more
deadly
has
entirely
different
effects
and
owes
its
deadliness
to
entirely
different
qualities
even
within
the
same
family
there
are
wide
differences
in
the
jararaca
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
yellow
venom
is
spurted
from
the
long
this
poison
is
secreted
in
large
glands
which
among
vipers
give
the
head
its
peculiar
shape
the
rattlesnake
yields
a
much
smaller
quantity
of
white
venom
but
quantity
for
quantity
this
white
venom
is
more
deadly
it
is
the
great
quantity
of
venom
injected
by
the
long
fangs
of
the
jararaca
the
bushmaster
and
their
fellows
that
renders
their
bite
so
generally
fatal
moreover
even
between
these
two
allied
genera
of
the
differences
in
the
action
of
the
poison
are
sufficiently
marked
to
be
easily
recognizable
and
to
render
the
most
effective
serum
for
each
slightly
different
from
the
other
however
they
are
near
enough
alike
to
make
this
difference
in
practice
of
comparatively
small
consequence
in
practice
the
same
serum
can
be
used
to
neutralize
the
effect
of
either
and
as
will
be
seen
later
on
the
snake
that
is
immune
to
one
kind
of
venom
is
also
immune
to
the
other
but
the
effect
of
the
venom
of
the
poisonous
colubrine
snakes
is
totally
different
from
although
to
the
full
as
deadly
as
the
effect
of
the
poison
of
the
rattlesnake
or
jararaca
the
serum
that
is
an
antidote
as
regards
the
colubrines
the
animal
that
is
immune
to
the
bite
of
one
may
not
be
immune
to
the
bite
of
the
other
the
bite
of
a
cobra
or
other
colubrine
poisonous
snake
is
more
painful
in
its
immediate
effects
than
is
the
bite
of
one
of
the
big
vipers
the
victim
suffers
more
there
is
a
greater
effect
on
the
but
less
swelling
of
the
wound
itself
and
whereas
the
blood
of
the
rattlesnake
victim
coagulates
the
blood
of
the
victim
of
an
elapine
snake
that
is
of
one
of
the
only
poisonous
american
colubrines
becomes
watery
and
incapable
of
coagulation
snakes
are
highly
specialized
in
every
way
including
their
prey
some
live
exclusively
on
animals
on
mammals
or
birds
some
live
exclusively
on
batrachians
others
only
on
lizards
a
few
only
on
insects
a
very
few
species
live
exclusively
on
other
snakes
these
include
one
very
formidable
venomous
snake
the
indian
hamadryad
or
giant
cobra
and
several
snakes
in
africa
i
killed
a
small
cobra
which
contained
within
it
a
snake
but
a
few
inches
shorter
than
itself
but
as
far
as
i
could
find
out
snakes
were
not
the
habitual
diet
of
the
african
cobras
the
poisonous
snakes
use
their
venom
to
kill
their
victims
and
also
to
kill
any
possible
foe
which
they
think
menaces
them
some
of
them
are
and
only
fight
if
injured
or
seriously
alarmed
others
are
excessively
irritable
and
on
rare
occasions
will
even
attack
of
their
own
accord
when
entirely
unprovoked
and
unthreatened
on
reaching
sao
paulo
on
our
southward
journey
from
rio
to
montevideo
we
drove
out
to
the
instituto
serumtherapico
designed
for
the
study
of
the
effects
of
the
venom
of
poisonous
brazilian
snakes
its
director
is
doctor
vital
brazil
who
has
performed
a
most
extraordinary
work
and
whose
experiments
and
investigations
are
not
only
of
the
utmost
value
to
brazil
but
will
ultimately
be
recognized
as
of
the
utmost
value
for
humanity
at
large
i
know
of
no
institution
of
similar
kind
anywhere
it
has
a
fine
modern
building
with
all
the
best
appliances
in
which
experiments
are
carried
on
with
all
kinds
of
serpents
living
and
dead
with
the
object
of
discovering
all
the
properties
of
their
several
kinds
of
venom
and
of
developing
various
serums
which
nullify
the
effects
of
the
different
venoms
every
effort
is
made
to
teach
the
people
at
large
by
practical
demonstration
in
the
open
field
the
lessons
thus
learned
in
the
laboratory
one
notable
result
has
been
the
diminution
in
the
mortality
from
in
the
province
of
sao
paulo
in
connection
with
his
institute
and
right
by
the
laboratory
the
doctor
has
a
large
serpentarium
in
which
quantities
of
the
common
poisonous
and
snakes
are
kept
and
some
of
the
rarer
ones
he
has
devoted
considerable
time
to
the
effort
to
find
out
if
there
are
any
natural
enemies
of
the
poisonous
snakes
of
his
country
and
he
has
discovered
that
the
most
formidable
enemy
of
the
many
dangerous
brazilian
snakes
is
a
entirely
harmless
rather
uncommon
brazilian
snake
the
mussurama
of
all
the
interesting
things
the
doctor
showed
us
by
far
the
most
interesting
was
the
opportunity
of
witnessing
for
ourselves
the
action
of
the
mussurama
toward
a
dangerous
snake
the
doctor
first
showed
us
specimens
of
the
various
important
snakes
poisonous
and
in
alcohol
then
he
showed
us
preparations
of
the
different
kinds
of
venom
and
of
the
different
serums
presenting
us
with
some
of
the
latter
for
our
use
on
the
journey
he
has
been
able
to
produce
two
distinct
kinds
of
serum
one
to
neutralize
the
virulent
poison
of
the
rattlesnake
bite
the
other
to
neutralize
the
poison
of
the
different
snakes
of
the
lachecis
genus
these
poisons
are
somewhat
different
and
moreover
there
appear
to
be
some
differences
between
the
poisons
of
the
different
species
of
lachecis
in
some
cases
the
poison
is
nearly
colorless
and
in
others
as
in
that
of
the
jararaca
whose
poison
i
saw
it
is
yellow
but
the
vital
difference
is
that
between
all
these
poisons
of
the
vipers
and
the
poisons
of
the
colubrine
snakes
such
as
the
cobra
and
the
as
yet
the
doctor
has
not
been
able
to
develop
an
serum
which
will
neutralize
the
poison
of
these
colubrine
snakes
practically
this
is
a
matter
of
little
consequence
in
brazil
for
the
brazilian
are
dangerous
only
when
mishandled
by
some
one
whose
bare
skin
is
exposed
to
the
bite
the
numerous
accidents
and
fatalities
continually
occurring
in
brazil
are
almost
always
to
be
laid
to
the
account
of
the
several
species
of
lachecis
and
the
single
species
of
rattlesnake
finally
the
doctor
took
us
into
his
to
show
us
how
he
conducted
his
experiments
the
various
snakes
were
in
boxes
on
one
side
of
the
room
under
the
care
of
a
skilful
and
impassive
assistant
who
handled
them
with
the
cool
and
fearless
caution
of
the
doctor
himself
the
poisonous
ones
were
taken
out
by
means
of
a
steel
hook
all
that
is
necessary
to
do
is
to
insert
this
under
the
snake
and
lift
him
off
the
ground
he
is
not
only
unable
to
escape
but
he
is
unable
to
strike
for
he
can
not
strike
unless
coiled
so
as
to
give
himself
support
and
leverage
the
table
on
which
the
snakes
are
laid
is
fairly
large
and
smooth
differing
in
no
way
from
an
ordinary
table
there
were
a
number
of
us
in
the
room
including
two
or
three
photographers
the
doctor
first
put
on
the
table
a
but
very
vicious
and
truculent
colubrine
snake
it
struck
right
and
left
at
us
then
the
doctor
picked
it
up
opened
its
mouth
and
showed
that
it
had
no
fangs
and
handed
it
to
me
i
also
opened
its
mouth
and
examined
its
teeth
and
then
put
it
down
whereupon
its
temper
having
been
much
ruffled
it
struck
violently
at
me
two
or
three
times
in
its
action
and
temper
this
snake
was
quite
as
vicious
as
the
most
irritable
poisonous
snakes
yet
it
is
entirely
harmless
one
of
the
innumerable
mysteries
of
nature
which
are
at
present
absolutely
insoluble
is
why
some
snakes
should
be
so
vicious
and
others
absolutely
placid
and
after
removing
the
vicious
harmless
snake
the
doctor
warned
us
to
get
away
from
the
table
and
his
attendant
put
on
it
in
succession
a
very
big
lachecis
of
the
kind
called
bushmaster
and
a
big
rattlesnake
each
coiled
menacingly
a
formidable
brute
ready
to
attack
anything
that
approached
then
the
attendant
adroitly
dropped
his
iron
crook
on
the
neck
of
each
in
succession
seized
it
right
behind
the
head
and
held
it
toward
the
doctor
the
snake
mouth
was
in
each
case
wide
open
and
the
great
fangs
erect
and
very
evident
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
held
an
african
cobra
in
such
fashion
because
the
would
have
ejected
its
venom
through
the
fangs
into
the
eyes
of
the
onlookers
there
was
no
danger
in
this
case
and
the
doctor
inserted
a
shallow
glass
saucer
into
the
mouth
of
the
snake
behind
the
fangs
permitted
it
to
eject
its
poison
and
then
himself
squeezed
out
the
remaining
poison
from
the
bags
through
the
fangs
from
the
big
lachecis
came
a
large
quantity
of
yellow
venom
a
liquid
which
speedily
crystallized
into
a
number
of
minute
crystals
the
rattlesnake
yielded
a
much
less
quantity
of
white
venom
which
the
doctor
assured
us
was
far
more
active
than
the
yellow
lachecis
venom
then
each
snake
was
returned
to
its
box
unharmed
after
this
the
doctor
took
out
of
a
box
and
presented
to
me
a
fine
handsome
nearly
black
snake
an
individual
of
the
species
called
the
mussurama
this
is
in
my
eyes
perhaps
the
most
interesting
serpent
in
the
world
it
is
a
big
snake
four
or
five
feet
long
sometimes
even
longer
nearly
black
lighter
below
with
a
friendly
placid
temper
it
lives
exclusively
on
other
snakes
and
is
completely
immune
to
the
poison
of
the
lachecis
and
rattlesnake
groups
which
contain
all
the
really
dangerous
snakes
of
america
doctor
brazil
told
me
that
he
had
conducted
many
experiments
with
this
interesting
snake
it
is
not
very
common
and
prefers
wet
places
in
which
to
live
it
lays
eggs
and
the
female
remains
coiled
above
the
eggs
the
object
being
apparently
not
to
warm
them
but
to
prevent
too
great
evaporation
it
will
not
eat
when
moulting
nor
in
cold
weather
otherwise
it
will
eat
a
small
snake
every
five
or
six
days
or
a
big
one
every
fortnight
there
is
the
widest
difference
both
among
poisonous
and
snakes
not
alone
in
nervousness
and
irascibility
but
also
in
ability
to
accustom
themselves
to
surroundings
many
species
of
snakes
which
are
entirely
harmless
to
man
or
to
any
other
animal
except
their
small
prey
are
nevertheless
very
vicious
and
truculent
striking
right
and
left
and
biting
freely
on
the
smallest
provocation
this
is
the
case
with
the
species
of
which
the
doctor
had
previously
placed
a
specimen
on
the
table
moreover
many
snakes
some
entirely
harmless
and
some
vicious
ones
are
so
nervous
and
uneasy
that
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
they
can
be
induced
to
eat
in
captivity
and
the
slightest
disturbance
or
interference
will
prevent
their
eating
there
are
other
snakes
however
of
which
the
mussurama
is
perhaps
the
best
example
which
are
very
good
captives
and
at
the
same
time
very
fearless
showing
a
complete
indifference
not
only
to
being
observed
but
to
being
handled
when
they
are
feeding
there
is
in
the
united
states
a
beautiful
and
attractive
snake
the
with
much
the
same
habits
as
the
mussurama
it
is
friendly
toward
mankind
and
not
poisonous
so
that
it
can
be
handled
freely
it
feeds
on
other
serpents
and
will
kill
a
rattlesnake
as
big
as
itself
being
immune
to
the
rattlesnake
venom
ditmars
of
the
bronx
zoo
has
made
many
interesting
experiments
with
these
snakes
i
have
had
them
in
my
own
possession
they
are
and
can
generally
be
handled
with
impunity
but
i
have
known
them
to
bite
whereas
doctor
brazil
informed
me
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
the
mussurama
bite
a
man
the
will
feed
greedily
on
other
snakes
in
the
presence
of
man
i
knew
of
one
case
where
it
partly
swallowed
another
snake
while
both
were
in
a
small
pocket
it
is
immune
to
viper
poison
but
it
is
not
immune
to
colubrine
poison
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
was
informed
of
a
case
where
one
of
these
was
put
into
an
enclosure
with
an
indian
eating
cobra
or
hamadryad
of
about
the
same
size
it
killed
the
cobra
but
made
no
effort
to
swallow
it
and
very
soon
showed
the
effects
of
the
cobra
poison
i
believe
it
afterward
died
but
unfortunately
i
have
mislaid
my
notes
and
can
not
now
remember
the
details
of
the
incident
doctor
brazil
informed
me
that
the
mussurama
like
the
was
not
immune
to
the
colubrine
poison
a
mussurama
in
his
possession
which
had
with
impunity
killed
and
eaten
several
rattlesnakes
and
representatives
of
the
lachecis
genus
also
killed
and
ate
a
venomous
but
shortly
afterward
itself
died
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
it
is
one
of
the
many
puzzles
of
nature
that
these
american
serpents
which
kill
poisonous
serpents
should
only
have
grown
immune
to
the
poison
of
the
most
dangerous
american
poisonous
serpents
the
and
should
not
have
become
immune
to
the
poison
of
the
which
are
commonly
distributed
throughout
their
range
yet
judging
by
the
one
instance
mentioned
by
doctor
brazil
they
attack
and
master
these
although
the
conflict
in
the
end
results
in
their
death
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
whether
this
attack
was
exceptional
that
is
whether
the
mussurama
has
or
has
not
as
a
species
learned
to
avoid
the
if
it
was
not
exceptional
then
not
only
is
the
instance
highly
curious
in
itself
but
it
would
also
go
far
to
explain
the
failure
of
the
mussurama
to
become
plentiful
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
acquainted
with
the
subject
i
may
mention
that
the
poison
of
a
poisonous
snake
is
not
dangerous
to
its
own
species
unless
injected
in
very
large
doses
about
ten
times
what
would
normally
be
injected
by
a
bite
but
that
it
is
deadly
to
all
other
snakes
poisonous
or
save
as
regards
the
very
few
species
which
themselves
eat
poisonous
snakes
the
indian
hamadryad
or
giant
cobra
is
exclusively
a
it
evidently
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
poisonous
and
snakes
for
ditmars
has
recorded
that
two
individuals
in
the
bronx
zoo
which
are
habitually
fed
on
harmless
snakes
and
attack
them
eagerly
refused
to
attack
a
copperhead
which
was
thrown
into
their
cage
being
evidently
afraid
of
this
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
if
the
hamadryad
is
afraid
to
prey
on
all
and
also
whether
it
will
prey
on
its
small
relative
the
true
cobra
for
it
may
well
be
that
even
if
not
immune
to
the
viper
poison
it
is
immune
to
the
poison
of
its
close
ally
the
smaller
cobra
all
these
and
many
other
questions
would
be
speedily
settled
by
doctor
brazil
if
he
were
given
the
opportunity
to
test
them
it
must
be
remembered
moreover
that
not
only
have
his
researches
been
of
absorbing
value
from
the
standpoint
of
pure
science
but
that
they
also
have
a
real
utilitarian
worth
he
is
now
collecting
and
breeding
the
mussurama
the
favorite
prey
of
the
mussurama
is
the
most
common
and
therefore
the
most
dangerous
poisonous
snake
of
brazil
the
jararaca
which
is
known
in
martinique
as
the
in
martinique
and
elsewhere
this
snake
is
such
an
object
of
terror
as
to
be
at
times
a
genuine
scourge
surely
it
would
be
worth
while
for
the
authorities
of
martinique
to
import
specimens
of
the
mussurama
to
that
island
the
mortality
from
in
british
india
is
very
great
surely
it
would
be
well
worth
while
for
the
able
indian
government
to
copy
brazil
and
create
such
an
institute
as
that
over
which
doctor
vital
brazil
is
the
curator
at
first
sight
it
seems
extraordinary
that
poisonous
serpents
so
dreaded
by
and
so
irresistible
to
most
animals
should
be
so
utterly
helpless
before
the
few
creatures
that
prey
on
them
but
the
explanation
is
easy
any
highly
specialized
creature
the
higher
its
specialization
is
apt
to
be
proportionately
helpless
when
once
its
peculiar
specialized
traits
are
effectively
nullified
by
an
opponent
this
is
eminently
the
case
with
the
most
dangerous
poisonous
snakes
in
them
a
highly
peculiar
specialization
has
been
carried
to
the
highest
point
they
rely
for
attack
and
defence
purely
on
their
all
other
means
and
methods
of
attack
and
defence
have
atrophied
they
neither
crush
nor
tear
with
their
teeth
nor
constrict
with
their
bodies
the
are
slender
and
delicate
and
save
for
the
poison
the
wound
inflicted
is
of
a
trivial
character
in
consequence
they
are
helpless
in
the
presence
of
any
animal
which
the
poison
does
not
affect
there
are
several
mammals
immune
to
bite
including
various
species
of
hedgehog
pig
and
mongoose
the
other
mammals
which
kill
them
do
so
by
pouncing
on
them
unawares
or
by
avoiding
their
stroke
through
sheer
quickness
of
movement
and
probably
this
is
the
case
with
most
birds
the
mongoose
is
very
quick
but
in
some
cases
at
least
i
have
mentioned
one
in
the
african
game
trails
it
permits
itself
to
be
bitten
by
poisonous
snakes
treating
the
bite
with
utter
indifference
there
should
be
extensive
experiments
made
to
determine
if
there
are
species
of
mongoose
immune
to
both
cobra
and
viper
poison
hedgehogs
as
determined
by
actual
experiments
pay
no
heed
at
all
to
viper
poison
even
when
bitten
on
such
tender
places
as
the
tongue
and
lips
and
eat
the
snake
as
if
it
were
a
radish
even
among
animals
which
are
not
immune
to
the
poison
different
species
are
very
differently
affected
by
the
different
kinds
of
snake
poisons
not
only
are
some
species
more
resistant
than
others
to
all
poisons
but
there
is
a
wide
variation
in
the
amount
of
immunity
each
displays
to
any
given
venom
one
species
will
be
quickly
killed
by
the
poison
from
one
species
of
snake
and
be
fairly
resistant
to
the
poison
of
another
whereas
in
another
species
the
conditions
may
be
directly
reversed
the
mussurama
which
doctor
brazil
handed
me
was
a
fine
specimen
perhaps
four
and
a
half
feet
long
i
lifted
the
smooth
lithe
bulk
in
my
hands
and
then
let
it
twist
its
coils
so
that
it
rested
at
ease
in
my
arms
it
glided
to
and
fro
on
its
own
length
with
the
sinuous
grace
of
its
kind
and
showed
not
the
slightest
trace
of
either
nervousness
or
bad
temper
meanwhile
the
doctor
bade
his
attendant
put
on
the
table
a
big
jararaca
or
which
was
accordingly
done
the
jararaca
was
about
three
feet
and
a
half
or
perhaps
nearly
four
feet
long
that
is
it
was
about
nine
inches
shorter
than
the
mussurama
the
latter
which
i
continued
to
hold
in
my
arms
behaved
with
friendly
and
impassive
indifference
moving
easily
to
and
fro
through
my
hands
and
once
or
twice
hiding
its
head
between
the
sleeve
and
the
body
of
my
coat
the
doctor
was
not
quite
sure
how
the
mussurama
would
behave
for
it
had
recently
eaten
a
small
snake
and
unless
hungry
it
pays
no
attention
whatever
to
venomous
snakes
even
when
they
attack
and
bite
it
however
it
fortunately
proved
still
to
have
a
good
appetite
the
jararaca
was
alert
and
vicious
it
partly
coiled
itself
on
the
table
threatening
the
bystanders
i
put
the
big
black
serpent
down
on
the
table
four
or
five
feet
from
the
enemy
and
headed
in
its
direction
as
soon
as
i
let
go
with
my
hands
it
glided
toward
where
the
threatening
lay
stretched
in
a
half
coil
the
mussurama
displayed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
excitement
apparently
it
trusted
little
to
its
eyes
for
it
began
to
run
its
head
along
the
body
of
the
jararaca
darting
out
its
flickering
tongue
to
feel
just
where
it
was
as
it
nosed
its
way
up
toward
the
head
of
its
antagonist
so
placid
were
its
actions
that
i
did
not
at
first
suppose
that
it
meant
to
attack
for
there
was
not
the
slightest
exhibition
of
anger
or
excitement
it
was
the
jararaca
that
began
the
fight
it
showed
no
fear
whatever
of
its
foe
but
its
irritable
temper
was
aroused
by
the
proximity
and
actions
of
the
other
and
like
a
flash
it
drew
back
its
head
and
struck
burying
its
fangs
in
the
forward
part
of
the
mussurama
body
immediately
the
latter
struck
in
return
and
the
was
so
instantaneous
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
just
what
had
happened
there
was
tremendous
writhing
and
struggling
on
the
part
of
the
jararaca
and
then
leaning
over
the
knot
into
which
the
two
serpents
were
twisted
i
saw
that
the
mussurama
had
seized
the
jararaca
by
the
lower
jaw
putting
its
own
head
completely
into
the
mouth
of
the
poisonous
snake
the
long
fangs
were
just
above
the
top
of
the
mussurama
head
and
it
appeared
as
well
as
i
could
see
that
they
were
once
again
driven
into
the
mussurama
but
without
the
slightest
effect
then
the
fangs
were
curved
back
in
the
jaw
a
fact
which
i
particularly
noted
and
all
effort
at
the
offensive
was
abandoned
by
the
poisonous
snake
meanwhile
the
mussurama
was
chewing
hard
and
gradually
shifted
its
grip
little
by
little
until
it
got
the
top
of
the
head
of
the
jararaca
in
its
mouth
the
lower
jaw
of
the
jararaca
being
spread
out
to
one
side
the
venomous
serpent
was
helpless
the
fearsome
master
of
the
wild
life
of
the
forest
the
deadly
foe
of
humankind
was
itself
held
in
the
grip
of
death
its
cold
baleful
serpent
eyes
shone
as
evil
as
ever
but
it
was
dying
in
vain
it
writhed
and
struggled
nothing
availed
it
once
or
twice
the
mussurama
took
a
turn
round
the
middle
of
the
body
of
its
opponent
but
it
did
not
seem
to
press
hard
and
apparently
used
its
coils
chiefly
in
order
to
get
a
better
grip
so
as
to
crush
the
head
of
its
antagonist
or
to
hold
the
latter
in
place
this
crushing
was
done
by
its
teeth
and
the
repeated
bites
were
made
with
such
effort
that
the
muscles
stood
out
on
the
mussurama
neck
then
it
took
two
coils
round
the
neck
of
the
jararaca
and
proceeded
deliberately
to
try
to
break
the
backbone
of
its
opponent
by
twisting
the
head
round
with
this
purpose
it
twisted
its
own
head
and
neck
round
so
that
the
surface
was
uppermost
and
indeed
at
one
time
it
looked
as
if
it
had
made
almost
a
complete
single
spiral
revolution
of
its
own
body
it
never
for
a
moment
relaxed
its
grip
except
to
shift
slightly
the
jaws
in
a
few
minutes
the
jararaca
was
dead
its
head
crushed
in
although
the
body
continued
to
move
convulsively
when
satisfied
that
its
opponent
was
dead
the
mussurama
began
to
try
to
get
the
head
in
its
mouth
this
was
a
process
of
some
difficulty
on
account
of
the
angle
at
which
the
lower
jaw
of
the
jararaca
stuck
out
but
finally
the
head
was
taken
completely
inside
and
then
swallowed
after
this
the
mussurama
proceeded
deliberately
but
with
unbroken
speed
to
devour
its
opponent
by
the
simple
process
of
crawling
outside
it
the
body
and
tail
of
the
jararaca
writhing
and
struggling
until
the
last
during
the
early
portion
of
the
meal
the
mussurama
put
a
stop
to
this
writhing
and
struggling
by
resting
its
own
body
on
that
of
its
prey
but
toward
the
last
the
part
of
the
body
that
remained
outside
was
left
free
to
wriggle
as
it
wished
not
only
was
the
mussurama
totally
indifferent
to
our
presence
but
it
was
totally
indifferent
to
being
handled
while
the
meal
was
going
on
several
times
i
replaced
the
combatants
in
the
middle
of
the
table
when
they
had
writhed
to
the
edge
and
finally
when
the
photographers
found
that
they
could
not
get
good
pictures
i
held
the
mussurama
up
against
a
white
background
with
the
partially
swallowed
snake
in
its
mouth
and
the
feast
went
on
uninterruptedly
i
never
saw
cooler
or
more
utterly
unconcerned
conduct
and
the
ease
and
certainty
with
which
the
terrible
poisonous
snake
was
mastered
gave
me
the
heartiest
respect
and
liking
for
the
and
exceedingly
efficient
serpent
which
i
had
been
holding
in
my
arms
our
trip
was
not
intended
as
a
but
as
a
scientific
expedition
before
starting
on
the
trip
itself
while
travelling
in
the
argentine
i
received
certain
pieces
of
information
concerning
the
natural
history
of
the
jaguar
and
of
the
cougar
or
puma
which
are
worth
recording
the
facts
about
the
jaguar
are
not
new
in
the
sense
of
casting
new
light
on
its
character
although
they
are
interesting
but
the
facts
about
the
behavior
of
the
puma
in
one
district
of
patagonia
are
of
great
interest
because
they
give
an
entirely
new
side
of
its
there
was
travelling
with
me
at
the
time
doctor
francisco
moreno
of
buenos
aires
doctor
moreno
is
at
the
present
day
a
member
of
the
national
board
of
education
of
the
argentine
a
man
who
has
worked
in
every
way
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
perhaps
especially
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
so
that
when
he
was
first
introduced
to
me
it
was
as
the
jacob
riis
of
the
argentine
for
they
know
my
deep
and
affectionate
intimacy
with
jacob
riis
he
is
also
an
eminent
man
of
science
who
has
done
admirable
work
as
a
geologist
and
a
geographer
at
one
period
in
connection
with
his
duties
as
a
boundary
commissioner
on
the
survey
between
chile
and
the
argentine
he
worked
for
years
in
patagonia
it
was
he
who
made
the
extraordinary
discovery
in
a
patagonian
cave
of
the
still
fresh
fragments
of
skin
and
other
remains
of
the
mylodon
the
aberrant
horse
known
as
the
onohipidium
the
huge
south
american
tiger
and
the
macrauchenia
all
of
them
extinct
animals
this
discovery
showed
that
some
of
the
strange
representatives
of
the
giant
south
american
pleistocene
fauna
had
lasted
down
to
within
a
comparatively
few
thousand
years
down
to
the
time
when
man
substantially
as
the
spaniards
found
him
flourished
on
the
continent
incidentally
the
discovery
tended
to
show
that
this
fauna
had
lasted
much
later
in
south
america
than
was
the
case
with
the
corresponding
faunas
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
therefore
it
tended
to
disprove
the
claims
advanced
by
doctor
ameghino
for
the
extreme
age
geologically
of
this
fauna
and
for
the
extreme
antiquity
of
man
on
the
american
continent
one
day
doctor
moreno
handed
me
a
copy
of
the
outlook
containing
my
account
of
a
in
arizona
saying
that
he
noticed
that
i
had
very
little
faith
in
cougars
attacking
men
although
i
had
explicitly
stated
that
such
attacks
sometimes
occurred
i
told
him
yes
that
i
had
found
that
the
cougar
was
practically
harmless
to
man
the
undoubtedly
authentic
instances
of
attacks
on
men
being
so
exceptional
that
they
could
in
practice
be
wholly
disregarded
thereupon
doctor
moreno
showed
me
a
scar
on
his
face
and
told
me
that
he
had
himself
been
attacked
and
badly
mauled
by
a
puma
which
was
undoubtedly
trying
to
prey
on
him
that
is
which
had
started
on
a
career
as
a
this
was
to
me
most
interesting
i
had
often
met
men
who
knew
other
men
who
had
seen
other
men
who
said
that
they
had
been
attacked
by
pumas
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
come
across
a
man
who
had
himself
been
attacked
doctor
moreno
as
i
have
said
is
not
only
an
eminent
citizen
but
an
eminent
scientific
man
and
his
account
of
what
occurred
is
unquestionably
a
scientifically
accurate
statement
of
the
facts
i
give
it
exactly
as
the
doctor
told
it
paraphrasing
a
letter
he
sent
me
and
including
one
or
two
answers
to
questions
i
put
to
him
the
doctor
by
the
way
stated
to
me
that
he
had
known
hudson
the
author
of
the
naturalist
on
the
plata
and
that
the
latter
knew
nothing
whatever
of
pumas
from
personal
experience
and
had
accepted
as
facts
utterly
wild
fables
undoubtedly
said
the
doctor
the
puma
in
south
america
like
the
puma
in
north
america
is
as
a
general
rule
a
cowardly
animal
which
not
only
never
attacks
man
but
rarely
makes
any
efficient
defence
when
attacked
the
indian
and
white
hunters
have
no
fear
of
it
in
most
parts
of
the
country
and
its
harmlessness
to
man
is
proverbial
but
there
is
one
particular
spot
in
southern
patagonia
where
cougars
to
the
doctor
own
personal
knowledge
have
for
years
been
dangerous
foes
of
man
this
curious
local
change
in
habits
by
the
way
is
nothing
unprecedented
as
regards
wild
animals
in
portions
of
its
range
as
i
am
informed
by
lord
smith
the
asiatic
tiger
can
hardly
be
forced
to
fight
man
and
never
preys
on
him
while
throughout
most
of
its
range
it
is
a
most
dangerous
beast
and
often
turns
so
there
are
waters
in
which
sharks
are
habitual
eaters
and
others
where
they
never
touch
men
and
there
are
rivers
and
lakes
where
crocodiles
or
caymans
are
very
dangerous
and
others
where
they
are
practically
harmless
i
have
myself
seen
this
in
africa
in
march
doctor
moreno
with
a
party
of
men
working
on
the
boundary
commission
and
with
a
number
of
patagonian
was
encamped
for
some
weeks
beside
lake
viedma
which
had
not
before
been
visited
by
white
men
for
a
century
and
which
was
rarely
visited
even
by
indians
one
morning
just
before
sunrise
he
left
his
camp
by
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
to
make
a
topographical
sketch
of
the
lake
he
was
unarmed
but
carried
a
prismatic
compass
in
a
leather
case
with
a
strap
it
was
cold
and
he
wrapped
his
poncho
of
hide
round
his
neck
and
head
he
had
walked
a
few
hundred
yards
when
a
puma
a
female
sprang
on
him
from
behind
and
knocked
him
down
as
she
sprang
on
him
she
tried
to
seize
his
head
with
one
paw
striking
him
on
the
shoulder
with
the
other
she
lacerated
his
mouth
and
also
his
back
but
tumbled
over
with
him
and
in
the
scuffle
they
separated
before
she
could
bite
him
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
as
he
said
was
forced
to
think
quickly
she
had
recovered
herself
and
sat
on
her
haunches
like
a
cat
looking
at
him
and
then
crouched
to
spring
again
whereupon
he
whipped
off
his
poncho
and
as
she
sprang
at
him
he
opened
it
and
at
the
same
moment
hit
her
head
with
the
prismatic
compass
in
its
case
which
he
held
by
the
strap
she
struck
the
poncho
and
was
evidently
puzzled
by
it
for
turning
she
slunk
off
to
one
side
under
a
bush
and
then
proceeded
to
try
to
get
round
behind
him
he
faced
her
keeping
his
eyes
upon
her
and
backed
off
she
followed
him
for
three
or
four
hundred
yards
at
least
twice
she
came
up
to
attack
him
but
each
time
he
opened
his
poncho
and
yelled
and
at
the
last
moment
she
shrank
back
she
continually
however
tried
by
taking
advantage
of
cover
to
sneak
up
to
one
side
or
behind
to
attack
him
finally
when
he
got
near
camp
she
abandoned
the
pursuit
and
went
into
a
small
patch
of
bushes
he
raised
the
alarm
an
indian
rode
up
and
set
fire
to
the
bushes
from
the
windward
side
when
the
cougar
broke
from
the
bushes
the
indian
rode
after
her
and
threw
his
bolas
which
twisted
around
her
hind
legs
and
while
she
was
struggling
to
free
herself
he
brained
her
with
his
second
bolas
the
doctor
injuries
were
rather
painful
but
not
serious
years
later
in
april
he
was
camped
on
the
same
lake
but
on
the
north
shore
at
the
foot
of
a
basaltic
cliff
he
was
in
company
with
four
soldiers
with
whom
he
had
travelled
from
the
strait
of
magellan
in
the
night
he
was
aroused
by
the
shriek
of
a
man
and
the
barking
of
his
dogs
as
the
men
sprang
up
from
where
they
were
lying
asleep
they
saw
a
large
puma
run
off
out
of
the
firelight
into
the
darkness
it
had
sprung
on
a
soldier
named
marcelino
huquen
while
he
was
asleep
and
had
tried
to
carry
him
off
fortunately
the
man
was
so
wrapped
up
in
his
blanket
as
the
night
was
cold
that
he
was
not
injured
the
puma
was
never
found
or
killed
about
the
same
time
a
surveyor
of
doctor
moreno
party
a
swede
named
arneberg
was
attacked
in
similar
fashion
the
doctor
was
not
with
him
at
the
time
arneberg
was
asleep
in
the
forest
near
lake
san
martin
the
cougar
both
bit
and
clawed
him
and
tore
his
mouth
breaking
out
three
teeth
the
man
was
rescued
but
this
puma
also
escaped
the
doctor
stated
that
in
this
particular
locality
the
indians
who
elsewhere
paid
no
heed
whatever
to
the
puma
never
let
their
women
go
out
after
wood
for
fuel
unless
two
or
three
were
together
this
was
because
on
several
occasions
women
who
had
gone
out
alone
were
killed
by
pumas
evidently
in
this
one
locality
the
habit
of
at
least
occasional
has
become
chronic
with
a
species
which
elsewhere
is
the
most
cowardly
and
to
man
the
least
dangerous
of
all
the
big
cats
these
observations
of
doctor
moreno
have
a
peculiar
value
because
as
far
as
i
know
they
are
the
first
trustworthy
accounts
of
a
having
attacked
man
save
under
circumstances
so
exceptional
as
to
make
the
attack
signify
little
more
than
the
similar
exceptional
instances
of
attack
by
various
other
species
of
wild
animals
that
are
not
normally
dangerous
to
man
the
jaguar
however
has
long
been
known
not
only
to
be
a
dangerous
foe
when
itself
attacked
but
also
now
and
then
to
become
a
therefore
the
instances
of
such
attacks
furnished
me
are
of
merely
corroborative
value
in
the
excellent
zoological
gardens
at
buenos
aires
the
curator
doctor
onelli
a
naturalist
of
note
showed
us
a
big
male
jaguar
which
had
been
trapped
in
the
chaco
where
it
had
already
begun
a
career
as
a
having
killed
three
persons
they
were
killed
and
two
of
them
were
eaten
the
animal
was
trapped
in
consequence
of
the
alarm
excited
by
the
death
of
his
third
victim
this
jaguar
was
very
savage
whereas
a
young
jaguar
which
was
in
a
cage
with
a
young
tiger
was
playful
and
friendly
as
was
also
the
case
with
the
young
tiger
on
my
trip
to
visit
la
plata
museum
i
was
accompanied
by
captain
vicente
montes
of
the
argentine
navy
an
accomplished
officer
of
scientific
attainments
he
had
at
one
time
been
engaged
on
a
survey
of
the
boundary
between
the
argentine
and
parana
and
brazil
they
had
a
quantity
of
dried
beef
in
camp
on
several
occasions
a
jaguar
came
into
camp
after
this
dried
beef
finally
they
succeeded
in
protecting
it
so
that
he
could
not
reach
it
the
result
however
was
disastrous
on
the
next
occasion
that
he
visited
camp
at
midnight
he
seized
a
man
everybody
was
asleep
at
the
time
and
the
jaguar
came
in
so
noiselessly
as
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
dogs
as
he
seized
the
man
the
latter
gave
one
yell
but
the
next
moment
was
killed
the
jaguar
driving
his
fangs
through
the
man
skull
into
the
brain
there
was
a
scene
of
uproar
and
confusion
and
the
jaguar
was
forced
to
drop
his
prey
and
flee
into
the
woods
next
morning
they
followed
him
with
the
dogs
and
finally
killed
him
he
was
a
large
male
in
condition
the
only
features
of
note
about
these
two
incidents
was
that
in
each
case
the
was
a
powerful
animal
in
the
prime
of
life
whereas
it
frequently
happens
that
the
jaguars
that
turn
eaters
are
old
animals
and
have
become
too
inactive
or
too
feeble
to
catch
their
ordinary
prey
during
the
two
months
before
starting
from
asuncion
in
paraguay
for
our
journey
into
the
interior
i
was
kept
so
busy
that
i
had
scant
time
to
think
of
natural
history
but
in
a
strange
land
a
man
who
cares
for
wild
birds
and
wild
beasts
always
sees
and
hears
something
that
is
new
to
him
and
interests
him
in
the
dense
tropical
woods
near
rio
janeiro
i
heard
in
late
october
springtime
near
the
southern
tropic
the
songs
of
many
birds
that
i
could
not
identify
but
the
most
beautiful
music
was
from
a
shy
woodland
thrush
which
lived
near
the
ground
in
the
thick
timber
but
sang
high
among
the
branches
at
a
great
distance
we
could
hear
the
ringing
musical
note
and
of
piercing
sweetness
which
occurs
at
intervals
in
the
song
at
first
i
thought
this
was
the
song
but
when
it
was
possible
to
approach
the
singer
i
found
that
these
notes
were
scattered
through
a
continuous
song
of
great
melody
i
never
listened
to
one
that
impressed
me
more
in
different
places
in
argentina
i
heard
and
saw
the
argentine
which
is
not
very
unlike
our
own
and
is
also
a
delightful
and
remarkable
singer
but
i
never
heard
the
wonderful
which
is
said
by
hudson
who
knew
well
the
birds
of
both
south
america
and
europe
to
be
the
of
them
all
most
of
the
birds
i
thus
noticed
while
hurriedly
passing
through
the
country
were
of
course
the
conspicuous
ones
the
spurred
lapwings
big
tame
boldly
marked
plover
were
everywhere
they
were
very
noisy
and
active
and
both
inquisitive
and
daring
and
they
have
a
very
curious
dance
custom
no
man
need
look
for
them
they
will
look
for
him
and
when
they
find
him
they
will
fairly
yell
the
discovery
to
the
universe
in
the
marshes
of
the
lower
parana
i
saw
flocks
of
headed
blackbirds
on
the
tops
of
the
reeds
the
females
are
as
strikingly
colored
as
the
males
and
their
bodies
and
brilliant
red
heads
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
escape
observation
among
their
natural
surroundings
on
the
plains
to
the
west
i
saw
flocks
of
the
beautiful
starlings
unlike
the
blackbirds
which
seemed
fairly
to
court
attention
these
starlings
sought
to
escape
observation
by
crouching
on
the
ground
so
that
their
red
breasts
were
hidden
there
were
blackbirds
in
wet
places
and
abounded
but
the
most
conspicuous
birds
i
saw
were
members
of
the
family
of
tyrant
flycatchers
of
which
our
own
is
the
most
familiar
example
this
family
is
very
numerously
represented
in
argentina
both
in
species
and
individuals
some
of
the
species
are
so
striking
both
in
color
and
habits
and
in
one
case
also
in
shape
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
even
the
unobservant
the
least
conspicuous
and
nevertheless
very
conspicuous
among
those
that
i
saw
was
the
bientevido
which
is
brown
above
yellow
beneath
with
a
boldly
marked
black
and
white
head
and
a
yellow
crest
it
is
very
noisy
is
common
in
the
neighborhood
of
houses
and
builds
a
big
domed
nest
it
is
really
a
big
heavy
kingbird
fiercer
and
more
powerful
than
any
northern
kingbird
i
saw
them
assail
not
only
the
big
but
the
small
hawks
with
fearlessness
driving
them
in
headlong
flight
they
not
only
capture
insects
but
pounce
on
mice
small
frogs
lizards
and
little
snakes
rob
birds
nests
of
the
fledgling
young
and
catch
tadpoles
and
even
small
fish
two
of
the
tyrants
which
i
observed
are
like
two
with
which
i
grew
fairly
familiar
in
texas
the
is
common
throughout
the
open
country
and
the
long
tail
feathers
which
seem
at
times
to
hamper
its
flight
attract
attention
whether
the
bird
is
in
flight
or
perched
on
a
tree
it
has
a
habit
of
occasionally
soaring
into
the
air
and
descending
in
loops
and
spirals
the
scarlet
tyrant
i
saw
in
the
orchards
and
gardens
the
male
is
a
fascinating
little
bird
black
above
while
his
crested
head
and
the
body
beneath
are
brilliant
scarlet
he
utters
his
rapid
musical
trill
in
the
air
rising
with
fluttering
wings
to
a
height
of
a
hundred
feet
hovering
while
he
sings
and
then
falling
back
to
earth
the
color
of
the
bird
and
the
character
of
his
performance
attract
the
attention
of
every
observer
bird
beast
or
man
within
reach
of
vision
the
tyrant
is
utterly
unlike
any
of
his
kind
in
the
united
states
and
until
i
looked
him
up
in
sclater
and
hudson
ornithology
i
never
dreamed
that
he
belonged
to
this
family
he
for
only
the
male
is
so
brightly
colored
is
with
a
back
i
saw
these
birds
on
december
near
barilloche
out
on
the
bare
patagonian
plains
they
behaved
like
pipits
or
longspurs
running
actively
over
the
ground
in
the
same
manner
and
showing
the
same
restlessness
and
the
same
kind
of
flight
but
whereas
pipits
are
inconspicuous
the
at
once
attracted
attention
by
the
contrast
between
their
bold
coloring
and
the
grayish
or
yellowish
tones
of
the
ground
along
which
they
ran
the
tyrant
however
is
much
more
conspicuous
i
saw
it
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
the
and
also
in
many
other
places
the
male
is
with
white
bill
and
wings
he
runs
about
on
the
ground
like
a
pipit
but
also
frequently
perches
on
some
bush
to
go
through
a
strange
performance
he
perches
motionless
bolt
upright
and
even
then
his
black
coloring
advertises
him
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
round
about
but
every
few
minutes
he
springs
up
into
the
air
to
the
height
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
the
white
wings
flashing
in
contrast
to
the
black
body
screams
and
gyrates
and
then
instantly
returns
to
his
former
post
and
resumes
his
erect
pose
of
waiting
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
more
conspicuous
bird
than
the
but
the
next
and
last
tyrant
flycatcher
of
which
i
shall
speak
possesses
on
the
whole
the
most
advertising
coloration
of
any
small
bird
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
open
country
and
moreover
this
advertising
coloration
exists
in
both
sexes
and
throughout
the
year
it
is
a
brilliant
white
all
over
except
the
long
and
the
ends
of
the
which
are
black
the
first
one
i
saw
at
a
very
long
distance
i
thought
must
be
an
albino
it
perches
on
the
top
of
a
bush
or
tree
watching
for
its
prey
and
it
shines
in
the
sun
like
a
silver
mirror
every
hawk
cat
or
man
must
see
it
no
one
can
help
seeing
it
these
common
argentine
birds
most
of
them
of
the
open
country
and
all
of
them
with
a
strikingly
advertising
coloration
are
interesting
because
of
their
beauty
and
their
habits
they
are
also
interesting
because
they
offer
such
illuminating
examples
of
the
truth
that
many
of
the
most
common
and
successful
birds
not
merely
lack
a
concealing
coloration
but
possess
a
coloration
which
is
in
the
highest
degree
revealing
the
coloration
and
the
habits
of
most
of
these
birds
are
such
that
every
hawk
or
other
foe
that
can
see
at
all
must
have
its
attention
attracted
to
them
evidently
in
their
cases
neither
the
coloration
nor
any
habit
of
concealment
based
on
the
coloration
is
a
survival
factor
and
this
although
they
live
in
a
land
teeming
with
hawks
among
the
higher
vertebrates
there
are
many
known
factors
which
have
influence
some
in
one
set
of
cases
some
in
another
set
of
cases
in
the
development
and
preservation
of
species
courage
intelligence
adaptability
prowess
bodily
vigor
speed
alertness
ability
to
hide
ability
to
build
structures
which
will
protect
the
young
while
they
are
helpless
fecundity
all
and
many
more
like
them
have
their
several
places
and
behind
all
these
visible
causes
there
are
at
work
other
and
often
more
potent
causes
of
which
as
yet
science
can
say
nothing
some
species
owe
much
to
a
given
attribute
which
may
be
wholly
lacking
in
influence
on
other
species
and
every
one
of
the
attributes
above
enumerated
is
a
survival
factor
in
some
species
while
in
others
it
has
no
survival
value
whatever
and
in
yet
others
although
of
benefit
it
is
not
of
sufficient
benefit
to
offset
the
benefit
conferred
on
foes
or
rivals
by
totally
different
attributes
intelligence
for
instance
is
of
course
a
survival
factor
but
there
exist
multitudes
of
animals
with
very
little
intelligence
which
have
persisted
through
immense
periods
of
geologic
time
either
unchanged
or
else
without
any
change
in
the
direction
of
increased
intelligence
and
during
their
they
have
witnessed
the
death
of
countless
other
species
of
far
greater
intelligence
but
in
other
ways
less
adapted
to
succeed
in
the
environmental
complex
the
same
statement
can
be
made
of
all
the
many
many
other
known
factors
in
development
from
fecundity
to
concealing
coloration
and
behind
them
lie
forces
as
to
which
we
veil
our
ignorance
by
the
use
of
nomenclature
as
when
we
use
such
a
convenient
but
far
from
satisfactory
term
as
orthogenesis
ii
up
the
paraguay
on
the
afternoon
of
december
we
left
the
attractive
and
picturesque
city
of
asuncion
to
ascend
the
paraguay
with
generous
courtesy
the
paraguayan
government
had
put
at
my
disposal
the
of
the
president
himself
a
most
comfortable
river
steamer
and
so
the
opening
days
of
our
trip
were
pleasant
in
every
way
the
food
was
good
our
quarters
were
clean
we
slept
well
below
or
on
deck
usually
without
our
and
in
daytime
the
deck
was
pleasant
under
the
awnings
it
was
hot
of
course
but
we
were
dressed
suitably
in
our
exploring
and
hunting
clothes
and
did
not
mind
the
heat
the
river
was
low
for
there
had
been
dry
weather
for
some
weeks
judging
from
the
vague
and
contradictory
information
i
received
there
is
much
elasticity
to
the
terms
wet
season
and
dry
season
at
this
part
of
the
paraguay
under
the
brilliant
sky
we
steamed
steadily
up
the
mighty
river
the
sunset
was
glorious
as
we
leaned
on
the
port
railing
and
after
nightfall
the
moon
nearly
full
and
hanging
high
in
the
heavens
turned
the
water
to
shimmering
radiance
on
the
and
sandbars
and
among
the
green
rushes
of
the
bays
and
inlets
were
stately
crimson
flamingoes
and
rosy
spoonbills
colored
ibis
and
white
storks
with
black
wings
darters
with
snakelike
necks
and
pointed
bills
perched
in
the
trees
on
the
brink
of
the
river
snowy
egrets
flapped
across
the
marshes
caymans
were
common
and
differed
from
the
crocodiles
we
had
seen
in
africa
in
two
points
they
were
not
alarmed
by
the
report
of
a
rifle
when
fired
at
and
they
lay
with
the
head
raised
instead
of
stretched
along
the
sand
for
three
days
as
we
steamed
northward
toward
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
then
passed
it
we
were
within
the
republic
of
paraguay
on
our
right
to
the
east
there
was
a
fairly
country
where
bananas
and
oranges
were
cultivated
and
other
crops
of
hot
countries
raised
on
the
banks
we
passed
an
occasional
small
town
or
saw
a
close
to
the
river
brink
or
stopped
for
wood
at
some
little
settlement
across
the
river
to
the
west
lay
the
level
swampy
fertile
wastes
known
as
the
chaco
still
given
over
either
to
the
wild
indians
or
to
on
a
gigantic
scale
the
broad
river
ran
in
curves
between
where
terraces
marked
successive
periods
of
flood
a
belt
of
forest
stood
on
each
bank
but
it
was
only
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
wide
back
of
it
was
the
open
country
on
the
chaco
side
this
was
a
vast
plain
of
grass
dotted
with
tall
graceful
palms
in
places
the
belt
of
forest
vanished
and
the
dotted
prairie
came
to
the
river
edge
the
chaco
is
an
ideal
cattle
country
and
not
really
unhealthy
it
will
be
covered
with
ranches
at
a
not
distant
day
but
mosquitoes
and
many
other
winged
insect
pests
swarm
over
it
cherrie
and
miller
had
spent
a
week
there
collecting
mammals
and
birds
prior
to
my
arrival
at
asuncion
they
were
veterans
of
the
tropics
hardened
to
the
insect
plagues
of
guiana
and
the
orinoco
but
they
reported
that
never
had
they
been
so
tortured
as
in
the
chaco
the
crawled
through
the
meshes
in
the
nets
and
forbade
them
to
sleep
if
in
their
sleep
a
knee
touched
the
net
the
mosquitoes
fell
on
it
so
that
it
looked
as
if
riddled
by
birdshot
and
the
nights
were
a
torment
although
they
had
done
well
in
their
work
collecting
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
specimens
of
birds
and
mammals
nevertheless
for
some
as
yet
inscrutable
reason
the
river
served
as
a
barrier
to
certain
insects
which
are
menaces
to
the
cattlemen
with
me
on
the
gunboat
was
an
old
western
friend
tex
rickard
of
the
panhandle
and
alaska
and
various
places
in
between
he
now
has
a
large
tract
of
land
and
some
thousand
head
of
cattle
in
the
chaco
opposite
concepcion
at
which
city
he
was
to
stop
he
told
me
that
horses
did
not
do
well
in
the
chaco
but
that
cattle
throve
and
that
while
ticks
swarmed
on
the
east
bank
of
the
great
river
they
would
not
live
on
the
west
bank
again
and
again
he
had
crossed
herds
of
cattle
which
were
covered
with
the
loathsome
bloodsuckers
and
in
a
couple
of
months
every
tick
would
be
dead
the
worst
animal
foes
of
man
indeed
the
only
dangerous
foes
are
insects
and
this
is
especially
true
in
the
tropics
fortunately
exactly
as
certain
differences
too
minute
for
us
as
yet
to
explain
render
some
insects
deadly
to
man
or
domestic
animals
while
closely
allied
forms
are
harmless
so
for
other
reasons
which
also
we
are
not
as
yet
able
to
fathom
these
insects
are
for
the
most
part
strictly
limited
by
geographical
and
other
considerations
the
war
against
what
sir
harry
johnston
calls
the
really
material
devil
the
devil
of
evil
wild
nature
in
the
tropics
has
been
waged
with
marked
success
only
during
the
last
two
decades
the
men
in
the
united
states
in
england
france
germany
italy
the
men
like
doctor
cruz
in
rio
janeiro
and
doctor
vital
brazil
in
sao
paulo
who
work
experimentally
within
and
without
the
laboratory
in
their
warfare
against
the
disease
and
death
bearing
insects
and
microbes
are
the
true
leaders
in
the
fight
to
make
the
tropics
the
home
of
civilized
man
late
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
of
our
trip
just
before
midnight
we
reached
concepcion
on
this
day
when
we
stopped
for
wood
or
to
get
provisions
at
picturesque
places
where
the
women
from
rough
mud
and
thatched
cabins
were
washing
clothes
in
the
river
or
where
ragged
horsemen
stood
gazing
at
us
from
the
bank
or
where
dark
ranchmen
stood
in
front
of
houses
we
caught
many
fish
they
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
formidable
genera
of
fish
in
the
world
the
piranha
or
cannibal
fish
the
fish
that
eats
men
when
it
can
get
the
chance
farther
north
there
are
species
of
small
piranha
that
go
in
schools
at
this
point
on
the
paraguay
the
piranha
do
not
seem
to
go
in
regular
schools
but
they
swarm
in
all
the
waters
and
attain
a
length
of
eighteen
inches
or
over
they
are
the
most
ferocious
fish
in
the
world
even
the
most
formidable
fish
the
sharks
or
the
barracudas
usually
attack
things
smaller
than
themselves
but
the
piranhas
habitually
attack
things
much
larger
than
themselves
they
will
snap
a
finger
off
a
hand
incautiously
trailed
in
the
water
they
mutilate
swimmers
in
every
river
town
in
paraguay
there
are
men
who
have
been
thus
mutilated
they
will
rend
and
devour
alive
any
wounded
man
or
beast
for
blood
in
the
water
excites
them
to
madness
they
will
tear
wounded
wild
fowl
to
pieces
and
bite
off
the
tails
of
big
fish
as
they
grow
exhausted
when
fighting
after
being
hooked
miller
before
i
reached
asuncion
had
been
badly
bitten
by
one
those
that
we
caught
sometimes
bit
through
the
hooks
or
the
double
strands
of
copper
wire
that
served
as
leaders
and
got
away
those
that
we
hauled
on
deck
lived
for
many
minutes
most
predatory
fish
are
long
and
slim
like
the
and
pickerel
but
the
piranha
is
a
short
fish
with
a
blunt
face
and
a
heavily
undershot
or
projecting
lower
jaw
which
gapes
widely
the
teeth
are
like
a
shark
and
the
jaw
muscles
possess
great
power
the
rabid
furious
snaps
drive
the
teeth
through
flesh
and
bone
the
head
with
its
short
muzzle
staring
malignant
eyes
and
gaping
cruelly
armed
jaws
is
the
embodiment
of
evil
ferocity
and
the
actions
of
the
fish
exactly
match
its
looks
i
never
witnessed
an
exhibition
of
such
impotent
savage
fury
as
was
shown
by
the
piranhas
as
they
flapped
on
deck
when
fresh
from
the
water
and
thrown
on
the
boards
they
uttered
an
extraordinary
squealing
sound
as
they
flapped
about
they
bit
with
vicious
eagerness
at
whatever
presented
itself
one
of
them
flapped
into
a
cloth
and
seized
it
with
a
bulldog
grip
another
grasped
one
of
its
fellows
another
snapped
at
a
piece
of
wood
and
left
the
deep
therein
they
are
the
pests
of
the
waters
and
it
is
necessary
to
be
exceedingly
cautious
about
either
swimming
or
wading
where
they
are
found
if
cattle
are
driven
into
or
of
their
own
accord
enter
the
water
they
are
commonly
not
molested
but
if
by
chance
some
unusually
big
or
ferocious
specimen
of
these
fearsome
fishes
does
bite
an
animal
taking
off
part
of
an
ear
or
perhaps
of
a
teat
from
the
udder
of
a
cow
the
blood
brings
up
every
member
of
the
ravenous
throng
which
is
anywhere
near
and
unless
the
attacked
animal
can
immediately
make
its
escape
from
the
water
it
is
devoured
alive
here
on
the
paraguay
the
natives
hold
them
in
much
respect
whereas
the
caymans
are
not
feared
at
all
the
only
redeeming
feature
about
them
is
that
they
are
themselves
fairly
good
to
eat
although
with
too
many
bones
at
daybreak
of
the
third
day
finding
we
were
still
moored
off
concepcion
we
were
rowed
ashore
and
strolled
off
through
the
streets
of
the
quaint
picturesque
old
town
a
town
which
like
asuncion
was
founded
by
the
conquistadores
of
a
century
before
our
own
english
and
dutch
forefathers
landed
in
what
is
now
the
united
states
the
jesuits
then
took
practically
complete
possession
of
what
is
now
paraguay
controlling
and
christianizing
the
indians
and
raising
their
flourishing
missions
to
a
pitch
of
prosperity
they
never
elsewhere
achieved
they
were
expelled
by
the
civil
authorities
backed
by
the
other
representatives
of
ecclesiastical
authority
some
fifty
years
before
spanish
south
america
became
independent
but
they
had
already
made
the
language
of
the
indians
guarany
a
tongue
reducing
it
to
writing
and
printing
religious
books
in
it
guarany
is
one
of
the
most
of
the
indian
tongues
being
originally
found
in
various
closely
allied
forms
not
only
in
paraguay
but
in
uruguay
and
over
the
major
part
of
brazil
it
remains
here
and
there
as
a
lingua
general
at
least
and
doubtless
in
cases
as
an
original
tongue
among
the
wild
tribes
in
most
of
brazil
as
around
para
and
around
sao
paulo
it
has
left
its
traces
in
but
has
been
completely
superseded
as
a
language
by
portuguese
in
paraguay
it
still
exists
side
by
side
with
spanish
as
the
common
language
of
the
lower
people
and
as
a
familiar
tongue
among
the
upper
classes
the
blood
of
the
people
is
mixed
their
language
dual
the
lower
classes
are
chiefly
of
indian
blood
but
with
a
white
admixture
while
the
upper
classes
are
predominantly
white
with
a
strong
infusion
of
indian
there
is
no
other
case
quite
parallel
to
this
in
the
annals
of
european
colonization
although
the
goanese
in
india
have
a
native
tongue
and
a
portuguese
creed
while
in
several
of
the
states
the
indian
blood
is
dominant
and
the
majority
of
the
population
speak
an
indian
tongue
perhaps
itself
as
with
the
quichuas
once
a
of
the
archaic
type
whether
in
paraguay
one
tongue
will
ultimately
drive
out
the
other
and
if
so
which
will
be
the
victor
it
is
yet
too
early
to
prophesy
the
english
missionaries
and
the
bible
society
have
recently
published
parts
of
the
scriptures
in
guarany
and
in
asuncion
a
daily
paper
is
published
with
the
text
in
parallel
columns
spanish
and
guarany
just
as
in
oklahoma
there
is
a
similar
paper
published
in
english
and
in
the
tongue
which
the
extraordinary
cherokee
chief
sequoia
a
veritable
cadmus
made
a
literary
language
the
paraguayan
is
a
christian
and
as
much
an
inheritor
of
our
common
culture
as
most
of
the
peasant
populations
of
europe
he
has
no
kinship
with
the
wild
indian
who
hates
and
fears
him
the
indian
of
the
chaco
a
pure
savage
a
savage
will
never
come
east
of
the
paraguay
and
the
paraguayan
is
only
beginning
to
venture
into
the
western
interior
away
from
the
banks
of
the
river
under
the
lead
of
pioneer
settlers
like
rickard
whom
by
the
way
the
wild
indians
thoroughly
trust
and
for
whom
they
work
eagerly
and
faithfully
there
is
a
great
development
ahead
for
paraguay
as
soon
as
they
can
definitely
shake
off
the
revolutionary
habit
and
establish
an
orderly
permanence
of
government
the
people
are
a
fine
people
the
strains
of
blood
white
and
indian
are
good
we
walked
up
the
streets
of
concepcion
and
interestedly
looked
at
everything
of
interest
at
the
houses
their
windows
covered
with
gratings
of
fretted
ironwork
and
their
occasional
open
doors
giving
us
glimpses
into
cool
inner
courtyards
with
trees
and
flowers
at
the
carts
drawn
by
mules
or
oxen
at
an
occasional
rider
with
spurs
on
his
bare
feet
and
his
big
toes
thrust
into
the
small
at
the
little
stores
and
the
warehouses
for
matte
and
hides
then
we
came
to
a
pleasant
little
inn
kept
by
a
frenchman
and
his
wife
of
old
spanish
style
with
its
patio
or
inner
court
but
as
neat
as
an
inn
in
normandy
or
brittany
we
were
sitting
at
coffee
around
a
little
table
when
in
came
the
colonel
of
the
garrison
for
concepcion
is
the
second
city
in
paraguay
he
told
me
that
they
had
prepared
a
reception
for
me
i
was
in
my
rough
clothes
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
accompany
my
kind
hosts
and
trust
to
their
good
nature
to
pardon
my
shortcomings
in
the
matter
of
dress
the
colonel
drove
me
about
in
a
smart
open
carriage
with
two
good
horses
and
a
liveried
driver
it
was
a
much
more
fashionable
turnout
than
would
be
seen
in
any
of
our
cities
save
the
largest
and
even
in
them
probably
not
in
the
service
of
a
public
official
in
all
the
south
american
countries
there
is
more
pomp
and
ceremony
in
connection
with
public
functions
than
with
us
and
at
these
functions
the
liveried
servants
often
with
and
powdered
hair
are
like
those
seen
at
similar
european
functions
there
is
not
the
democratic
simplicity
which
better
suits
our
own
habits
of
life
and
ways
of
thought
but
the
south
americans
often
surpass
us
not
merely
in
pomp
and
ceremony
but
in
what
is
of
real
importance
courtesy
in
civility
and
courtesy
we
can
well
afford
to
take
lessons
from
them
we
first
visited
the
barracks
saw
the
troops
in
the
exercises
and
inspected
the
arms
the
artillery
the
equipment
there
was
a
german
lieutenant
with
the
paraguayan
officers
one
of
several
german
officers
who
are
now
engaged
in
helping
the
paraguayans
with
their
army
the
equipments
and
arms
were
in
good
condition
the
enlisted
men
evidently
offered
fine
material
and
the
officers
were
doing
hard
work
it
is
worth
while
for
to
ponder
the
fact
that
in
every
south
american
country
where
a
really
efficient
army
is
developed
the
increase
in
military
efficiency
goes
hand
in
hand
with
a
decrease
in
lawlessness
and
disorder
and
a
growing
reluctance
to
settle
internal
disagreements
by
violence
they
are
introducing
universal
military
service
in
paraguay
the
officers
many
of
whom
have
studied
abroad
are
growing
to
feel
an
increased
esprit
de
corps
an
increased
pride
in
the
army
and
therefore
a
desire
to
see
the
army
made
the
servant
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
not
the
tool
of
any
faction
or
individual
if
these
feelings
grow
strong
enough
they
will
be
powerful
factors
in
giving
paraguay
what
she
most
needs
freedom
from
revolutionary
disturbance
and
therefore
the
chance
to
achieve
the
material
prosperity
without
which
as
a
basis
there
can
be
no
advance
in
other
and
even
more
important
matters
then
i
was
driven
to
the
city
hall
accompanied
by
the
intendente
or
mayor
a
german
long
settled
in
the
country
and
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
city
there
was
a
breakfast
when
i
had
to
speak
i
impressed
into
my
service
as
interpreter
a
young
paraguayan
who
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
he
was
able
to
render
into
spanish
my
ideas
on
such
subjects
as
orderly
liberty
and
the
mischief
done
by
the
revolutionary
habit
with
clearness
and
vigor
because
he
thoroughly
understood
not
only
how
i
felt
but
also
the
american
way
of
looking
at
such
things
my
hosts
were
hospitality
itself
and
i
enjoyed
the
unexpected
greeting
we
steamed
on
up
the
river
now
and
then
we
passed
another
boat
a
steamer
or
to
my
surprise
perhaps
a
barkentine
or
schooner
the
paraguay
is
a
highway
of
traffic
once
we
passed
a
big
factory
ranches
stood
on
either
bank
a
few
leagues
apart
and
we
stopped
at
on
the
west
bank
indians
worked
around
them
at
one
such
yard
the
indians
were
evidently
part
of
the
regular
force
their
squaws
were
with
them
cooking
at
queer
ovens
one
small
child
had
as
pets
a
parrot
and
a
young
coati
a
kind
of
nosed
raccoon
loading
wood
the
indians
stood
in
a
line
tossing
the
logs
from
one
to
the
other
these
indians
wore
clothes
on
this
day
we
got
into
the
tropics
even
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
deck
was
pleasant
under
the
awnings
the
sun
rose
and
set
in
crimson
splendor
and
the
nights
with
the
moon
at
the
full
were
wonderful
at
night
orion
blazed
overhead
and
the
southern
cross
hung
in
the
heavens
behind
us
but
after
the
moon
rose
the
constellations
paled
and
clear
in
her
light
the
banks
stood
on
either
hand
as
we
steamed
steadily
against
the
swirling
current
of
the
great
river
at
noon
on
the
twelfth
we
were
at
the
brazilian
boundary
on
this
day
we
here
and
there
came
on
low
conical
hills
close
to
the
river
in
places
the
palm
groves
broke
through
the
belts
of
deciduous
trees
and
stretched
for
a
mile
or
so
right
along
the
river
bank
at
times
we
passed
cattle
on
the
banks
or
followed
by
their
herders
or
a
handsome
under
a
cluster
of
shady
trees
some
bearing
a
wealth
of
red
and
some
a
wealth
of
yellow
blossoms
or
we
saw
a
corral
among
the
trees
close
to
the
brink
with
the
horses
in
it
and
a
barefooted
man
in
shirt
and
trousers
leaning
against
the
fence
or
a
herd
of
cattle
among
the
palms
or
a
big
tannery
or
factory
or
a
little
native
hamlet
came
in
sight
we
stopped
at
one
tannery
the
owner
was
a
spaniard
the
manager
an
oriental
as
he
called
himself
a
uruguayan
of
german
parentage
the
peons
or
workers
who
lived
in
a
long
line
of
wooden
cabins
back
of
the
main
building
were
mostly
paraguayans
with
a
few
brazilians
and
a
dozen
german
and
argentine
foremen
there
were
also
some
wild
indians
who
were
camped
in
the
usual
squalid
fashion
of
indians
who
are
round
the
white
man
but
have
not
yet
adopted
his
ways
most
of
the
men
were
at
work
cutting
wood
for
the
tannery
the
women
and
children
were
in
camp
some
individuals
of
both
sexes
were
naked
to
the
waist
one
little
girl
had
a
young
ostrich
as
a
pet
were
plentiful
we
saw
large
flocks
of
wild
muscovy
ducks
our
tame
birds
come
from
this
wild
species
and
its
absurd
misnaming
dates
back
to
the
period
when
the
turkey
and
were
misnamed
in
similar
fashion
our
european
forefathers
taking
a
large
and
hazy
view
of
geography
and
including
turkey
guinea
india
and
muscovy
as
places
which
in
their
capacity
of
being
outlandish
could
be
comprehensively
used
as
including
america
the
muscovy
ducks
were
very
good
eating
darters
and
cormorants
swarmed
they
waddled
on
the
bars
in
big
flocks
and
crowded
the
trees
by
the
water
edge
beautiful
egrets
also
lit
in
the
trees
often
well
back
from
the
river
a
tree
of
vivid
green
its
round
surface
crowded
with
these
birds
as
if
it
had
suddenly
blossomed
with
huge
white
flowers
is
a
sight
worth
seeing
here
and
there
on
the
bars
we
saw
huge
jabiru
storks
and
once
a
flock
of
white
among
the
trees
on
the
bank
on
the
brazilian
boundary
we
met
a
shallow
river
steamer
carrying
colonel
candido
mariano
da
silva
rondon
and
several
other
brazilian
members
of
the
expedition
colonel
rondon
immediately
showed
that
he
was
all
and
more
than
all
that
could
be
desired
it
was
evident
that
he
knew
his
business
thoroughly
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
he
would
be
a
pleasant
companion
he
was
a
classmate
of
lauro
muller
at
the
brazilian
military
academy
he
is
of
almost
pure
indian
blood
and
is
a
positivist
the
positivists
are
a
really
strong
body
in
brazil
as
they
are
in
france
and
indeed
in
chile
the
colonel
seven
children
have
all
been
formally
made
members
of
the
positivist
church
in
rio
janeiro
brazil
possesses
the
same
complete
liberty
in
matters
religious
spiritual
and
intellectual
as
we
for
our
great
good
fortune
do
in
the
united
states
and
my
brazilian
companions
included
catholics
and
equally
sincere
men
who
described
themselves
as
libres
penseurs
colonel
rondon
has
spent
the
last
years
in
exploring
the
western
highlands
of
brazil
pioneering
the
way
for
and
railroads
during
that
time
he
has
travelled
some
fourteen
thousand
miles
on
territory
most
of
which
had
not
previously
been
traversed
by
civilized
man
and
has
built
three
thousand
miles
of
telegraph
he
has
an
exceptional
knowledge
of
the
indian
tribes
and
has
always
zealously
endeavored
to
serve
them
and
indeed
to
serve
the
cause
of
humanity
wherever
and
whenever
he
was
able
thanks
mainly
to
his
efforts
four
of
the
wild
tribes
of
the
region
he
has
explored
have
begun
to
tread
the
road
of
civilization
they
have
taken
the
first
steps
toward
becoming
christians
it
may
seem
strange
that
among
the
of
the
efforts
of
a
positivist
should
be
the
conversion
of
those
he
seeks
to
benefit
to
christianity
but
in
south
america
christianity
is
at
least
as
much
a
status
as
a
theology
it
represents
the
indispensable
first
step
upward
from
savagery
in
the
wilder
and
poorer
districts
men
are
divided
into
the
two
great
classes
of
christians
and
indians
when
an
indian
becomes
a
christian
he
is
accepted
into
and
becomes
wholly
absorbed
or
partly
assimilated
by
the
crude
and
simple
neighboring
civilization
and
then
he
moves
up
or
down
like
any
one
else
among
his
fellows
among
colonel
rondon
companions
were
captain
amilcar
de
magalhaes
lieutenant
joao
lyra
lieutenant
joaquin
de
mello
filho
and
doctor
euzebio
de
oliveira
a
geologist
the
steamers
halted
colonel
rondon
and
several
of
his
officers
spick
and
span
in
their
white
uniforms
came
aboard
and
in
the
afternoon
i
visited
him
on
his
steamer
to
talk
over
our
plans
when
these
had
been
fully
discussed
and
agreed
on
we
took
tea
i
happened
to
mention
that
one
of
our
naturalists
miller
had
been
bitten
by
a
piranha
and
the
fish
at
once
became
the
subject
of
conversation
curiously
enough
one
of
the
brazilian
taxidermists
had
also
just
been
severely
bitten
by
a
piranha
my
new
companions
had
story
after
story
to
tell
of
them
only
three
weeks
previously
a
boy
who
had
gone
in
swimming
near
corumba
was
attacked
and
literally
devoured
alive
by
them
colonel
rondon
during
his
exploring
trips
had
met
with
more
than
one
unpleasant
experience
in
connection
with
them
he
had
lost
one
of
his
toes
by
the
bite
of
a
piranha
he
was
about
to
bathe
and
had
chosen
a
shallow
pool
at
the
edge
of
the
river
which
he
carefully
inspected
until
he
was
satisfied
that
none
of
the
fish
were
in
it
yet
as
soon
as
he
put
his
foot
into
the
water
one
of
them
attacked
him
and
bit
off
a
toe
on
another
occasion
while
wading
across
a
narrow
stream
one
of
his
party
was
attacked
the
fish
bit
him
on
the
thighs
and
buttocks
and
when
he
put
down
his
hands
tore
them
also
he
was
near
the
bank
and
by
a
rush
reached
it
and
swung
himself
out
of
the
water
by
means
of
an
overhanging
limb
of
a
tree
but
he
was
terribly
injured
and
it
took
him
six
months
before
his
wounds
healed
and
he
recovered
an
extraordinary
incident
occurred
on
another
trip
the
party
were
without
food
and
very
hungry
on
reaching
a
stream
they
dynamited
it
and
waded
in
to
seize
the
stunned
fish
as
they
floated
on
the
surface
one
man
lieutenant
pyrineus
having
his
hands
full
tried
to
hold
one
fish
by
putting
its
head
into
his
mouth
it
was
a
piranha
and
seemingly
stunned
but
in
a
moment
it
recovered
and
bit
a
big
section
out
of
his
tongue
such
a
hemorrhage
followed
that
his
life
was
saved
with
the
utmost
difficulty
on
another
occasion
a
member
of
the
party
was
off
by
himself
on
a
mule
the
mule
came
into
camp
alone
following
his
track
back
they
came
to
a
ford
where
in
the
water
they
found
the
skeleton
of
the
dead
man
his
clothes
uninjured
but
every
particle
of
flesh
stripped
from
his
bones
whether
he
had
drowned
and
the
fishes
had
then
eaten
his
body
or
whether
they
had
killed
him
it
was
impossible
to
say
they
had
not
hurt
the
clothes
getting
in
under
them
which
made
it
seem
likely
that
there
had
been
no
struggle
these
fish
are
a
veritable
scourge
in
the
waters
they
frequent
but
it
must
not
be
understood
by
this
that
the
piranhas
or
for
the
matter
of
that
the
caymans
and
crocodiles
ever
become
such
dreaded
foes
of
man
as
for
instance
the
crocodiles
of
africa
accidents
occur
and
there
are
certain
places
where
swimming
and
bathing
are
dangerous
but
in
most
places
the
people
swim
freely
although
they
are
usually
careful
to
find
spots
they
believe
safe
or
else
to
keep
together
and
make
a
splashing
in
the
water
during
his
trips
colonel
rondon
had
met
with
various
experiences
with
wild
creatures
the
paraguayan
caymans
are
not
ordinarily
dangerous
to
man
but
they
do
sometimes
become
and
should
be
destroyed
whenever
the
opportunity
offers
the
huge
caymans
and
crocodiles
of
the
amazon
are
far
more
dangerous
and
the
colonel
knew
of
repeated
instances
where
men
women
and
children
had
become
their
victims
once
while
dynamiting
a
stream
for
fish
for
his
starving
party
he
partially
stunned
a
giant
anaconda
which
he
killed
as
it
crept
slowly
off
he
said
that
it
was
of
a
size
that
no
other
anaconda
he
had
ever
seen
even
approached
and
that
in
his
opinion
such
a
brute
if
hungry
would
readily
attack
a
man
twice
smaller
anacondas
had
attacked
his
dogs
one
was
carried
under
water
for
the
anaconda
is
a
loving
serpent
but
he
rescued
it
one
of
his
men
was
bitten
by
a
jararaca
he
killed
the
venomous
snake
but
was
not
discovered
and
brought
back
to
camp
until
it
was
too
late
to
save
his
life
the
puma
colonel
rondon
had
found
to
be
as
cowardly
as
i
have
always
found
it
but
the
jaguar
was
a
formidable
beast
which
occasionally
turned
eater
and
often
charged
savagely
when
brought
to
bay
he
had
known
a
hunter
to
be
killed
by
a
jaguar
he
was
following
in
thick
grass
cover
all
such
enemies
however
he
regarded
as
utterly
trivial
compared
to
the
real
dangers
of
the
wilderness
the
torment
and
menace
of
attacks
by
the
swarming
insects
by
mosquitoes
and
the
even
more
intolerable
tiny
gnats
by
the
ticks
and
by
the
vicious
poisonous
ants
which
occasionally
cause
villages
and
even
whole
districts
to
be
deserted
by
human
beings
these
insects
and
the
fevers
they
cause
and
dysentery
and
starvation
and
wearing
hardship
and
accidents
in
rapids
are
what
the
pioneer
explorers
have
to
fear
the
conversation
was
to
me
most
interesting
the
colonel
spoke
french
about
to
the
extent
i
did
but
of
course
he
and
the
others
preferred
portuguese
and
then
kermit
was
the
interpreter
in
the
evening
soon
after
moonrise
we
stopped
for
wood
at
the
little
brazilian
town
of
porto
martinho
there
are
about
twelve
hundred
inhabitants
some
of
the
buildings
were
of
stone
a
large
private
house
with
a
castellated
tower
was
of
stone
there
were
shops
and
a
stores
a
restaurant
and
and
warehouses
for
matte
of
which
much
is
grown
in
the
region
roundabout
most
of
the
houses
were
low
with
overhanging
sloping
caves
and
there
were
gardens
with
high
walls
inside
of
which
trees
rose
many
of
them
fragrant
we
wandered
through
the
wide
dusty
streets
and
along
the
narrow
sidewalks
it
was
a
hot
still
evening
the
smell
of
the
tropics
was
on
the
heavy
december
air
through
the
open
doors
and
windows
we
caught
dim
glimpses
of
the
inmates
of
the
poorer
houses
women
and
young
girls
sat
outside
their
thresholds
in
the
moonlight
all
whom
we
met
were
most
friendly
the
captain
of
the
little
brazilian
garrison
the
intendente
a
local
trader
another
trader
and
ranchman
a
uruguayan
who
had
just
received
his
newspaper
containing
my
speech
in
montevideo
and
who
as
i
gathered
from
what
i
understood
of
his
rather
voluble
spanish
was
much
impressed
by
my
views
on
democracy
honesty
liberty
and
order
rather
topics
and
a
catalan
who
spoke
french
and
who
was
accompanied
by
his
pretty
daughter
a
dear
little
girl
of
eight
or
ten
who
said
with
much
pride
that
she
spoke
three
languages
brazilian
spanish
and
catalan
her
father
expressed
strongly
his
desire
for
a
church
and
for
a
school
in
the
little
city
when
at
last
the
wood
was
aboard
we
resumed
our
journey
the
river
was
like
glass
in
the
white
moonlight
the
palms
on
the
edge
of
the
banks
stood
mirrored
in
the
still
water
we
sat
forward
and
as
we
rounded
the
curves
the
long
silver
reaches
of
the
great
stream
stretched
ahead
of
us
and
the
ghostly
outlines
of
hills
rose
in
the
distance
here
and
there
prairie
fires
burned
and
the
red
glow
warred
with
the
moon
radiance
next
morning
was
overcast
occasionally
we
passed
a
or
factory
or
cabin
now
on
the
eastern
the
brazilian
now
on
the
western
the
paraguayan
bank
the
paraguay
was
known
to
men
of
european
birth
bore
soldiers
and
priests
and
merchants
as
they
sailed
and
rowed
up
and
down
the
current
of
its
stream
and
beheld
little
towns
and
forts
rise
on
its
banks
long
before
the
mississippi
had
become
the
white
man
highway
now
along
its
upper
course
the
settlements
are
much
like
those
on
the
mississippi
at
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
last
century
and
in
the
not
distant
future
it
will
witness
a
burst
of
growth
and
prosperity
much
like
that
which
the
mississippi
saw
when
the
old
men
of
today
were
very
young
in
the
early
forenoon
we
stopped
at
a
little
paraguayan
hamlet
nestling
in
the
green
growth
under
a
group
of
low
hills
by
the
brink
on
one
of
these
hills
stood
a
picturesque
old
stone
fort
known
as
fort
bourbon
in
the
spanish
the
colonial
days
now
the
paraguayan
flag
floats
over
it
and
it
is
garrisoned
by
a
handful
of
paraguayan
soldiers
here
father
zahm
baptized
two
children
the
youngest
of
a
large
family
of
small
people
whose
father
was
a
paraguayan
and
the
mother
an
oriental
or
uruguayan
no
priest
had
visited
the
village
for
three
years
and
the
children
were
respectively
one
and
two
years
of
age
the
sponsors
included
the
local
commandante
and
a
married
couple
from
austria
in
answer
to
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
perfunctory
question
whether
they
were
catholics
the
parents
returned
the
unexpected
answer
that
they
were
not
further
questioning
elicited
the
fact
that
the
father
called
himself
a
thinking
catholic
and
the
mother
said
she
was
a
protestant
catholic
her
mother
having
been
a
protestant
the
daughter
of
an
immigrant
from
normandy
however
it
appeared
that
the
older
children
had
been
baptized
by
the
bishop
of
asuncion
so
father
zahm
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
parents
proceeded
with
the
ceremony
they
were
good
people
and
although
they
wished
liberty
to
think
exactly
as
they
individually
pleased
they
also
wished
to
be
connected
and
to
have
their
children
connected
with
some
church
by
preference
the
church
of
the
majority
of
their
people
a
very
short
experience
of
communities
where
there
is
no
church
ought
to
convince
the
most
heterodox
of
the
absolute
need
of
a
church
i
earnestly
wish
that
there
could
be
such
an
increase
in
the
personnel
and
equipment
of
the
catholic
church
in
south
america
as
to
permit
the
establishment
of
one
good
and
earnest
priest
in
every
village
or
little
community
in
the
far
interior
nor
is
there
any
inconsistency
between
this
wish
and
the
further
wish
that
there
could
be
a
marked
extension
and
development
of
the
native
protestant
churches
such
as
i
saw
established
here
and
there
in
brazil
uruguay
and
argentina
and
of
the
associations
the
bulk
of
these
good
people
who
profess
religion
will
continue
to
be
catholics
but
the
spiritual
needs
of
a
more
or
less
considerable
minority
will
best
be
met
by
the
establishment
of
protestant
churches
or
in
places
even
of
a
positivist
church
or
ethical
culture
society
not
only
is
the
establishment
of
such
churches
a
good
thing
for
the
body
politic
as
a
whole
but
a
good
thing
for
the
catholic
church
itself
for
their
presence
is
a
constant
spur
to
activity
and
clean
and
honorable
conduct
and
a
constant
reflection
on
sloth
and
moral
laxity
the
government
in
each
of
these
commonwealths
is
doing
everything
possible
to
further
the
cause
of
education
and
the
tendency
is
to
treat
education
as
peculiarly
a
function
of
government
and
to
make
it
where
the
government
acts
sectarian
obligatory
and
free
a
cardinal
doctrine
of
our
own
great
democracy
to
which
we
are
committed
by
every
principle
of
sound
americanism
there
must
be
absolute
religious
liberty
for
tyranny
and
intolerance
are
as
abhorrent
in
matters
intellectual
and
spiritual
as
in
matters
political
and
material
and
more
and
more
we
must
all
realize
that
conduct
is
of
infinitely
greater
importance
than
dogma
but
no
democracy
can
afford
to
overlook
the
vital
importance
of
the
ethical
and
spiritual
the
truly
religious
element
in
life
and
in
practice
the
average
good
man
grows
clearly
to
understand
this
and
to
express
the
need
in
concrete
form
by
saying
that
no
community
can
make
much
headway
if
it
does
not
contain
both
a
church
and
a
school
we
took
breakfast
the
brazilian
breakfast
on
colonel
rondon
boat
caymans
were
becoming
more
plentiful
the
ugly
brutes
lay
on
the
and
like
logs
always
with
the
head
raised
sometimes
with
the
jaws
open
they
are
often
dangerous
to
domestic
animals
and
are
always
destructive
to
fish
and
it
is
good
to
shoot
them
i
killed
half
a
dozen
and
missed
nearly
as
many
more
a
throbbing
boat
does
not
improve
one
aim
we
passed
forests
of
palms
that
extended
for
leagues
and
vast
marshy
meadows
where
storks
herons
and
ibis
were
gathered
with
flocks
of
cormorants
and
darters
on
the
and
stilts
skimmers
and
clouds
of
beautiful
swaying
terns
in
the
foreground
about
noon
we
passed
the
highest
point
which
the
old
spanish
conquistadores
and
explorers
irala
and
ayolas
had
reached
in
the
course
of
their
marvellous
journeys
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
at
a
time
when
there
was
not
a
settlement
in
what
is
now
the
united
states
and
when
hardly
a
single
english
sea
captain
had
ventured
so
much
as
to
cross
the
atlantic
by
the
following
day
the
country
on
the
east
bank
had
become
a
vast
marshy
plain
dotted
here
and
there
by
patches
of
higher
land
the
morning
was
rainy
a
contrast
to
the
fine
weather
we
had
hitherto
encountered
we
passed
and
at
one
of
the
latter
the
owner
an
argentine
of
irish
parentage
who
still
spoke
english
with
the
accent
of
the
land
of
his
parents
nativity
remarked
that
this
was
the
first
time
the
american
flag
had
been
seen
on
the
upper
paraguay
for
our
gunboat
carried
it
at
the
masthead
early
in
the
afternoon
having
reached
the
part
where
both
banks
of
the
river
were
brazilian
territory
we
came
to
the
old
colonial
portuguese
fort
of
coimbra
it
stands
where
two
steep
hills
rise
one
on
either
side
of
the
river
and
it
guards
the
between
them
it
was
captured
by
the
paraguayans
in
the
war
of
nearly
half
a
century
ago
some
modern
guns
have
been
mounted
and
there
is
a
garrison
of
brazilian
troops
the
white
fort
is
perched
on
the
hillside
where
it
clings
and
rises
terrace
above
terrace
with
bastion
and
parapet
and
crenellated
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
riverine
plain
stretches
the
village
with
its
roofs
of
palm
in
the
village
dwell
several
hundred
souls
almost
entirely
the
officers
and
soldiers
and
their
families
there
is
one
long
street
the
houses
have
low
eaves
and
steep
sloping
roofs
of
or
of
split
under
one
or
two
old
but
small
trees
there
are
rude
benches
and
for
a
part
of
the
length
of
the
street
there
is
a
rough
stone
sidewalk
a
little
graveyard
some
of
the
tombs
very
old
stands
at
one
end
as
we
passed
down
the
street
the
wives
and
the
swarming
children
of
the
garrison
were
at
the
doors
and
windows
there
were
women
and
girls
with
skins
as
fair
as
any
in
the
northland
and
others
that
were
predominantly
negro
most
were
of
intervening
shades
all
this
was
paralleled
among
the
men
and
the
fusion
of
the
colors
was
going
on
steadily
around
the
village
black
vultures
were
gathered
not
long
before
reaching
it
we
passed
some
rounded
green
trees
their
tops
covered
with
the
showy
at
the
same
time
we
saw
behind
them
farther
inland
other
trees
crowded
with
the
more
delicate
forms
of
the
shining
white
egrets
the
river
now
widened
so
that
in
places
it
looked
like
a
long
lake
it
wound
in
every
direction
through
the
endless
marshy
plain
whose
surface
was
broken
here
and
there
by
low
mountains
the
splendor
of
the
sunset
i
never
saw
surpassed
we
were
steaming
east
toward
clouds
of
storm
the
river
ran
a
broad
highway
of
molten
gold
into
the
flaming
sky
the
mountains
loomed
purple
across
the
marshes
belts
of
rich
green
the
river
banks
stood
out
on
either
side
against
the
of
the
rippling
water
in
front
as
we
forged
steadily
onward
hung
the
tropic
night
dim
and
vast
on
december
we
reached
corumba
for
three
or
four
miles
before
it
is
reached
the
west
bank
on
which
it
stands
becomes
high
rocky
ground
falling
away
into
cliffs
the
country
roundabout
was
evidently
well
peopled
we
saw
gauchos
the
equivalent
of
our
own
cowboys
riding
along
the
bank
women
were
washing
clothes
and
their
naked
children
bathing
on
the
shore
we
were
told
that
caymans
and
piranhas
rarely
ventured
near
a
place
where
so
much
was
going
on
and
that
accidents
generally
occurred
in
ponds
or
lonely
stretches
of
the
river
several
steamers
came
out
to
meet
us
and
accompanied
us
for
a
dozen
miles
with
bands
playing
and
the
passengers
cheering
just
as
if
we
were
nearing
some
town
on
the
hudson
corumba
is
on
a
steep
hillside
with
wide
roughly
paved
streets
some
of
them
lined
with
beautiful
trees
that
bear
scarlet
flowers
and
with
houses
most
of
them
of
one
story
some
of
two
or
three
stories
we
were
greeted
with
a
reception
by
the
municipal
council
and
were
given
a
state
dinner
the
hotel
kept
by
an
italian
was
as
comfortable
as
possible
stone
floors
high
ceilings
big
windows
and
doors
a
cool
open
courtyard
and
a
of
course
corumba
is
still
a
frontier
town
the
vehicles
and
there
are
no
carriages
and
oxen
as
well
as
mules
are
used
for
riding
the
water
comes
from
a
big
central
well
around
it
the
gather
and
their
contents
are
then
peddled
around
at
the
different
houses
the
families
showed
the
mixture
of
races
characteristic
of
brazil
one
mother
after
the
children
had
been
photographed
in
their
ordinary
costume
begged
that
we
return
and
take
them
in
their
sunday
clothes
which
was
accordingly
done
in
a
year
the
railway
from
rio
will
reach
corumba
and
then
this
city
and
the
country
roundabout
will
see
much
development
at
this
point
we
rejoined
the
rest
of
the
party
and
very
glad
we
were
to
see
them
cherrie
and
miller
had
already
collected
some
eight
hundred
specimens
of
mammals
and
birds
iii
a
on
the
taquary
the
morning
after
our
arrival
at
corumba
i
asked
colonel
rondon
to
inspect
our
outfit
for
his
experience
of
what
is
necessary
in
tropical
travelling
has
been
gained
through
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
arduous
exploration
in
the
wilderness
it
was
fiala
who
had
assembled
our
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
and
he
and
sigg
during
their
stay
in
corumba
had
been
putting
everything
in
shape
for
our
start
colonel
rondon
at
the
end
of
his
inspection
said
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
suggest
that
it
was
extraordinary
that
fiala
without
personal
knowledge
of
the
tropics
could
have
gathered
the
things
most
necessary
with
the
minimum
of
bulk
and
maximum
of
usefulness
miller
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
piranhas
which
swarmed
at
one
of
the
camps
he
and
cherrie
had
made
in
the
chaco
so
numerous
were
they
that
the
members
of
the
party
had
to
be
exceedingly
careful
in
dipping
up
water
miller
did
not
find
that
they
were
cannibals
toward
their
own
kind
they
were
cannibals
only
in
the
sense
of
eating
the
flesh
of
men
when
dead
piranhas
and
even
when
mortally
injured
piranhas
with
the
blood
flowing
were
thrown
among
the
ravenous
living
they
were
left
unmolested
moreover
it
was
experience
the
direct
contrary
of
which
we
had
been
told
that
splashing
and
a
commotion
in
the
water
attracted
the
piranhas
whereas
they
rarely
attacked
anything
that
was
motionless
unless
it
was
bloody
dead
birds
and
mammals
thrown
whole
and
unskinned
into
the
water
were
permitted
to
float
off
unmolested
whereas
the
skinned
carcass
of
a
monkey
was
at
once
seized
pulled
under
the
water
and
completely
devoured
by
the
fish
a
man
who
had
dropped
something
of
value
waded
in
after
it
to
above
the
knees
but
went
very
slowly
and
quietly
avoiding
every
possibility
of
disturbance
and
not
venturing
to
put
his
hands
into
the
water
but
nobody
could
bathe
and
even
the
slightest
disturbance
in
the
water
such
as
that
made
by
scrubbing
the
hands
vigorously
with
soap
immediately
attracted
the
attention
of
the
savage
little
creatures
who
darted
to
the
place
evidently
hoping
to
find
some
animal
in
difficulties
once
while
miller
and
some
indians
were
attempting
to
launch
a
boat
and
were
making
a
great
commotion
in
the
water
a
piranha
attacked
a
naked
indian
who
belonged
to
the
party
and
mutilated
him
as
he
struggled
and
splashed
in
the
stream
men
not
making
a
splashing
and
struggling
are
rarely
attacked
but
if
one
is
attacked
by
any
chance
the
blood
in
the
water
maddens
the
piranhas
and
they
assail
the
man
with
frightful
ferocity
at
corumba
the
weather
was
hot
in
the
patio
of
the
comfortable
little
hotel
we
heard
the
cicadas
but
i
did
not
hear
the
extraordinary
screaming
whistle
of
the
locomotive
cicada
which
i
had
heard
in
the
gardens
of
the
house
in
which
i
stayed
at
asuncion
this
was
as
remarkable
a
sound
as
any
animal
sound
to
which
i
have
listened
except
only
the
wailing
of
the
tree
hyrax
in
east
africa
and
like
the
east
african
mammal
this
south
american
insect
has
a
voice
or
rather
utters
a
sound
which
so
far
as
it
resembles
any
other
animal
sound
at
the
beginning
remotely
suggests
batrachian
affinities
the
part
of
the
utterance
however
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
a
small
steam
siren
when
first
heard
it
seems
impossible
that
it
can
be
produced
by
an
insect
on
december
colonel
rondon
and
several
members
of
our
party
started
on
a
shallow
river
steamer
for
the
ranch
of
senhor
de
barros
las
palmeiras
on
the
rio
taquary
we
went
down
the
paraguay
for
a
few
miles
and
then
up
the
taquary
it
was
a
beautiful
trip
the
shallow
river
we
were
aground
several
times
wound
through
a
vast
marshy
plain
with
occasional
spots
of
higher
land
on
which
trees
grew
there
were
many
darters
swarmed
but
the
conspicuous
and
attractive
bird
was
the
stately
jabiru
stork
flocks
of
these
storks
whitened
the
marshes
and
lined
the
river
banks
they
were
not
shy
for
such
big
birds
before
flying
they
had
to
run
a
few
paces
and
then
launch
themselves
on
the
air
once
at
noon
a
couple
soared
round
overhead
in
wide
rings
rising
higher
and
higher
on
another
occasion
late
in
the
day
a
flock
passed
by
gleaming
white
with
black
points
in
the
long
afternoon
lights
and
with
them
were
spoonbills
showing
rosy
amid
their
snowy
companions
caymans
always
called
jacares
swarmed
and
we
killed
scores
of
the
noxious
creatures
they
were
singularly
indifferent
to
our
approach
and
to
the
sound
of
the
shots
sometimes
they
ran
into
the
water
erect
on
their
legs
looking
like
miniatures
of
the
monsters
of
the
prime
one
showed
by
its
behavior
how
little
an
ordinary
shot
pains
or
affects
these
blooded
creatures
as
it
lay
on
a
it
was
hit
with
a
long
bullet
it
slid
into
the
water
but
found
itself
in
the
midst
of
a
school
of
fish
it
at
once
forgot
everything
except
its
greedy
appetite
and
began
catching
the
fish
it
seized
fish
after
fish
holding
its
head
above
water
as
soon
as
its
jaws
had
closed
on
a
fish
and
a
second
bullet
killed
it
some
of
the
crocodiles
when
shot
performed
most
extraordinary
antics
our
weapons
by
the
way
were
good
except
miller
shotgun
the
outfit
furnished
by
the
american
museum
was
excellent
except
in
guns
and
cartridges
this
gun
was
so
bad
that
miller
had
to
use
fiala
gun
or
else
my
fox
in
the
late
afternoon
we
secured
a
more
interesting
creature
than
the
jacares
kermit
had
charge
of
two
hounds
which
we
owed
to
the
courtesy
of
one
of
our
argentine
friends
they
were
biggish
nondescript
animals
obviously
good
fighters
and
they
speedily
developed
the
utmost
affection
for
all
the
members
of
the
expedition
but
especially
for
kermit
who
took
care
of
them
one
we
named
shenzi
the
name
given
the
wild
bush
natives
by
the
swahili
the
african
porters
he
was
rough
and
stupid
hence
his
name
the
other
was
called
by
a
native
name
trigueiro
the
chance
now
came
to
try
them
we
were
steaming
between
long
stretches
of
coarse
grass
about
three
feet
high
when
we
spied
from
the
deck
a
black
object
very
conspicuous
against
the
vivid
green
it
was
a
giant
or
tamandua
bandeira
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
creatures
of
the
world
it
is
about
the
size
of
a
rather
small
black
bear
it
has
a
very
long
narrow
toothless
snout
with
a
tongue
it
can
project
a
couple
of
feet
it
is
covered
with
coarse
black
hair
save
for
a
couple
of
white
stripes
it
has
a
long
bushy
tail
and
very
powerful
claws
on
its
fore
feet
it
walks
on
the
sides
of
its
fore
feet
with
these
claws
curved
in
under
the
foot
the
claws
are
used
in
digging
out
but
the
beast
has
courage
and
in
a
grapple
is
a
rather
unpleasant
enemy
in
spite
of
its
toothless
mouth
for
it
can
strike
a
formidable
blow
with
these
claws
it
sometimes
hugs
a
foe
gripping
him
tight
but
its
ordinary
method
of
defending
itself
is
to
strike
with
its
long
stout
curved
claws
which
driven
by
its
muscular
forearm
can
rip
open
man
or
beast
several
of
our
companions
had
had
dogs
killed
by
these
and
we
came
across
one
man
with
a
very
ugly
scar
down
his
back
where
he
had
been
hit
by
one
which
charged
him
when
he
came
up
to
kill
it
at
close
quarters
as
soon
as
we
saw
the
giant
tamandua
we
pushed
off
in
a
rowboat
and
landed
only
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
distant
from
our
clumsy
quarry
the
tamandua
throughout
most
of
its
habitat
rarely
leaves
the
forest
and
it
is
a
helpless
animal
in
the
open
plain
the
two
dogs
ran
ahead
followed
by
colonel
rondon
and
kermit
with
me
behind
carrying
the
rifle
in
a
minute
or
two
the
hounds
overtook
the
cantering
shuffling
creature
and
promptly
began
a
fight
with
it
the
combatants
were
so
mixed
up
that
i
had
to
wait
another
minute
or
so
before
i
could
fire
without
risk
of
hitting
a
dog
we
carried
our
prize
back
to
the
bank
and
hoisted
it
aboard
the
steamer
the
sun
was
just
about
to
set
behind
dim
mountains
many
miles
distant
across
the
marsh
soon
afterward
we
reached
one
of
the
outstations
of
the
huge
ranch
we
were
about
to
visit
and
hauled
up
alongside
the
bank
for
the
night
there
was
a
and
sheds
and
corrals
several
of
the
peons
or
gauchos
had
come
to
meet
us
after
dark
they
kindled
fires
and
sat
beside
them
singing
songs
in
a
strange
minor
key
and
strumming
guitars
the
red
firelight
flickered
over
their
wild
figures
as
they
squatted
away
from
the
blaze
where
the
light
and
the
shadow
met
it
was
still
and
hot
there
were
mosquitoes
of
course
and
other
insects
of
all
kinds
swarmed
round
every
light
but
the
steamboat
was
comfortable
and
we
passed
a
pleasant
night
at
sunrise
we
were
off
for
the
fazenda
the
ranch
of
de
barros
the
baggage
went
in
an
which
had
to
make
two
trips
so
that
all
of
my
belongings
reached
the
ranch
a
day
later
than
i
did
we
rode
small
tough
ranch
horses
the
distance
was
some
twenty
miles
the
whole
country
was
marsh
varied
by
stretches
of
higher
ground
and
although
these
stretches
rose
only
three
or
four
feet
above
the
marsh
they
were
covered
with
thick
jungle
largely
palmetto
scrub
or
else
with
open
palm
forest
for
three
or
four
miles
we
splashed
through
the
marsh
now
and
then
crossing
boggy
pools
where
the
little
horses
labored
hard
not
to
mire
down
our
dusky
guide
was
clad
in
a
shirt
trousers
and
fringed
leather
apron
and
wore
spurs
on
his
bare
feet
he
had
a
rope
for
a
bridle
and
two
or
three
toes
of
each
foot
were
thrust
into
little
iron
stirrups
the
pools
in
the
marsh
were
drying
they
were
filled
with
fish
most
of
them
dead
or
dying
and
the
birds
had
gathered
to
the
banquet
the
most
notable
dinner
guests
were
the
great
jabiru
storks
the
stately
creatures
dotted
the
marsh
but
ibis
and
herons
abounded
the
former
uttered
queer
querulous
cries
when
they
discovered
our
presence
the
spurred
lapwings
were
as
noisy
as
they
always
are
the
ibis
and
plover
did
not
pay
any
heed
to
the
fish
but
the
black
carrion
vultures
feasted
on
them
in
the
mud
and
in
the
pools
that
were
not
dry
small
alligators
the
were
feasting
also
in
many
places
the
stench
from
the
dead
fish
was
unpleasant
then
for
miles
we
rode
through
a
beautiful
open
forest
of
tall
slender
caranda
palms
with
other
trees
scattered
among
them
green
parakeets
with
black
heads
chattered
as
they
flew
noisy
green
and
red
parrots
climbed
among
the
palms
and
huge
macaws
some
entirely
blue
others
almost
entirely
red
screamed
loudly
as
they
perched
in
the
trees
or
took
wing
at
our
approach
if
one
was
wounded
its
cries
kept
its
companions
circling
around
overhead
the
naturalists
found
the
bird
fauna
totally
different
from
that
which
they
had
been
collecting
in
the
hill
country
near
corumba
seventy
or
eighty
miles
distant
and
birds
swarmed
both
species
and
individuals
south
america
has
the
most
extensive
and
most
varied
avifauna
of
all
the
continents
on
the
other
hand
its
mammalian
fauna
although
very
interesting
is
rather
poor
in
number
of
species
and
individuals
and
in
the
size
of
the
beasts
it
possesses
more
mammals
that
are
unique
and
distinctive
in
type
than
does
any
other
continent
save
australia
and
they
are
of
higher
and
much
more
varied
types
than
in
australia
but
there
is
nothing
approaching
the
majesty
beauty
and
swarming
mass
of
the
great
mammalian
life
of
africa
and
in
a
less
degree
of
tropical
asia
indeed
it
does
not
even
approach
the
similar
mammalian
life
of
north
america
and
northern
eurasia
poor
though
this
is
compared
with
the
seething
vitality
of
tropical
life
in
the
old
world
during
a
geologically
recent
period
a
period
extending
into
that
which
saw
man
spread
over
the
world
in
substantially
the
physical
and
cultural
stage
of
many
existing
savages
south
america
possessed
a
varied
and
striking
fauna
of
enormous
beasts
tigers
huge
lions
mastodons
horses
of
many
kinds
pachyderms
giant
sloths
mylodons
the
size
of
the
rhinoceros
and
many
many
other
strange
and
wonderful
creatures
from
some
cause
concerning
the
nature
of
which
we
can
not
at
present
even
hazard
a
guess
this
vast
and
giant
fauna
vanished
completely
the
tremendous
catastrophe
the
duration
of
which
is
unknown
not
being
consummated
until
within
a
few
thousand
or
a
few
score
thousand
years
when
the
white
man
reached
south
america
he
found
the
same
weak
and
impoverished
mammalian
fauna
that
exists
practically
unchanged
elsewhere
civilized
man
has
been
even
more
destructive
than
his
very
destructive
uncivilized
brothers
of
the
magnificent
mammalian
life
of
the
wilderness
for
ages
he
has
been
rooting
out
the
higher
forms
of
beast
life
in
europe
asia
and
north
africa
and
in
our
own
day
he
has
repeated
the
feat
on
a
very
large
scale
in
the
rest
of
africa
and
in
north
america
but
in
south
america
although
he
is
in
places
responsible
for
the
wanton
slaughter
of
the
most
interesting
and
the
largest
or
the
most
beautiful
birds
his
advent
has
meant
a
positive
enrichment
of
the
wild
mammalian
fauna
none
of
the
native
mammals
the
graminivores
approach
in
size
and
beauty
the
herds
of
wild
or
wild
cattle
and
horses
or
so
add
to
the
interest
of
the
landscape
there
is
every
reason
why
the
good
people
of
south
america
should
waken
as
we
of
north
america
very
late
in
the
day
are
beginning
to
waken
and
as
the
peoples
of
northern
europe
not
southern
europe
have
already
partially
wakened
to
the
duty
of
preserving
from
impoverishment
and
extinction
the
wild
life
which
is
an
asset
of
such
interest
and
value
in
our
several
lands
but
the
case
against
civilized
man
in
this
matter
is
gruesomely
heavy
anyhow
when
the
plain
truth
is
told
and
it
is
harmed
by
exaggeration
after
five
or
six
hours
travelling
through
this
country
of
marsh
and
of
palm
forest
we
reached
the
ranch
for
which
we
were
heading
in
the
neighborhood
stood
giant
singly
or
in
groups
with
dense
dark
green
foliage
ponds
overgrown
with
lay
about
wet
meadow
and
drier
pastureland
open
or
dotted
with
palms
and
varied
with
tree
jungle
stretched
for
many
miles
on
every
hand
there
are
some
thirty
thousand
head
of
cattle
on
the
ranch
besides
herds
of
horses
and
droves
of
swine
and
a
few
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
the
home
buildings
of
the
ranch
stood
in
a
quadrangle
surrounded
by
a
fence
or
low
stockade
one
end
of
the
quadrangle
was
formed
by
the
itself
one
story
high
with
whitewashed
walls
and
tiled
roof
inside
the
rooms
were
bare
with
clean
whitewashed
walls
and
rafters
there
were
solid
wooden
shutters
on
the
unglazed
windows
we
slept
in
hammocks
or
on
cots
and
we
feasted
royally
on
delicious
native
brazilian
dishes
on
another
side
of
the
quadrangle
stood
another
long
low
white
building
with
a
roof
this
held
the
kitchen
and
the
of
the
peons
the
headmen
the
cook
and
with
their
families
men
their
wives
showing
varied
strains
of
white
indian
and
negro
blood
the
children
tumbled
merrily
in
the
dust
and
were
fondly
tended
by
their
mothers
opposite
the
kitchen
stood
a
row
of
buildings
some
whitewashed
daub
and
wattle
with
tin
roofs
others
of
erect
with
thatch
these
were
the
storehouse
and
stable
the
was
allotted
to
kermit
and
miller
for
the
preparation
of
the
specimens
and
there
they
worked
industriously
with
a
big
skin
like
that
of
the
giant
they
had
to
squat
on
the
ground
while
the
ducklings
and
wee
chickens
scuffled
not
only
round
the
skin
but
all
over
it
grabbing
the
shreds
and
scraps
of
meat
and
catching
flies
the
fourth
end
of
the
quadrangle
was
formed
by
a
corral
and
a
big
wooden
scaffolding
on
which
hung
hides
and
strips
of
drying
meat
extraordinary
to
relate
there
were
no
mosquitoes
at
the
ranch
why
i
can
not
say
as
they
ought
to
swarm
in
these
vast
pantanals
or
swamps
therefore
in
spite
of
the
heat
it
was
very
pleasant
near
by
stood
other
buildings
sheds
and
thatched
huts
of
in
which
the
ordinary
peons
lived
and
big
corrals
in
the
quadrangle
were
flamboyant
trees
with
their
masses
of
brilliant
red
flowers
and
delicately
cut
foliage
noisy
haunted
these
trees
in
a
high
palm
in
the
garden
a
family
of
green
parakeets
had
taken
up
their
abode
and
were
preparing
to
build
nests
they
chattered
incessantly
both
when
they
flew
and
when
they
sat
or
crawled
among
the
branches
ibis
and
plover
crying
and
wailing
passed
immediately
overhead
jacanas
frequented
the
ponds
near
by
the
peons
with
a
familiarity
which
to
us
seems
sacrilegious
but
to
them
was
entirely
inoffensive
and
matter
of
course
called
them
the
jesus
christ
birds
because
they
walked
on
the
water
there
was
a
wealth
of
strange
bird
life
in
the
neighborhood
there
were
large
marshes
the
papyrus
not
being
a
fifth
perhaps
not
a
tenth
as
high
as
in
africa
in
these
swamps
were
many
blackbirds
some
uttered
notes
that
reminded
me
of
our
own
redwings
others
with
crimson
heads
and
necks
and
thighs
fairly
blazed
often
a
dozen
sat
together
on
a
swaying
which
their
weight
bent
over
there
were
all
kinds
of
extraordinary
in
the
trees
there
is
still
need
for
the
work
of
the
collector
in
south
america
but
i
believe
that
already
so
far
as
birds
are
concerned
there
is
infinitely
more
need
for
the
work
of
the
careful
observer
who
to
the
power
of
appreciation
and
observation
adds
the
power
of
vivid
truthful
and
interesting
narration
which
means
as
scientists
no
less
than
historians
should
note
that
training
in
the
writing
of
good
english
is
indispensable
to
any
learned
man
who
expects
to
make
his
learning
count
for
what
it
ought
to
count
in
the
effect
on
his
fellow
men
the
outdoor
naturalist
the
faunal
naturalist
who
devotes
himself
primarily
to
a
study
of
the
habits
and
of
the
of
birds
beasts
fish
and
reptiles
and
who
can
portray
truthfully
and
vividly
what
he
has
seen
could
do
work
of
more
usefulness
than
any
mere
collector
in
this
upper
paraguay
country
the
work
of
the
collector
is
indispensable
but
it
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
work
that
ought
to
be
done
and
after
collecting
has
reached
a
certain
point
the
work
of
the
field
observer
with
the
gift
for
recording
what
he
has
seen
becomes
of
far
more
importance
the
long
days
spent
riding
through
the
swamp
the
pantanal
were
pleasant
and
interesting
several
times
we
saw
the
tamandua
bandeira
the
giant
kermit
shot
one
because
the
naturalists
eagerly
wished
for
a
second
specimen
afterward
we
were
relieved
of
all
necessity
to
molest
the
strange
creatures
it
was
a
surprise
to
us
to
find
them
habitually
frequenting
the
open
marsh
they
were
always
on
muddy
ground
and
in
the
we
found
them
in
several
inches
of
water
the
stomach
is
like
a
gizzard
the
stomachs
of
those
we
shot
contained
adult
and
larval
ants
chiefly
termites
together
with
plenty
of
black
mould
and
fragments
of
leaves
both
green
and
dry
doubtless
the
earth
and
the
vegetable
matter
had
merely
been
taken
incidentally
adhering
to
the
viscid
tongue
when
it
was
thrust
into
the
ant
masses
out
in
the
open
marsh
the
tamandua
could
neither
avoid
observation
nor
fight
effectively
nor
make
good
its
escape
by
flight
it
was
curious
to
see
one
lumbering
off
at
a
rocking
canter
the
big
bushy
tail
held
aloft
one
while
fighting
the
dogs
suddenly
threw
itself
on
its
back
evidently
hoping
to
grasp
a
dog
with
its
paws
and
it
now
and
then
reared
in
order
to
strike
at
its
assailants
in
one
patch
of
thick
jungle
we
saw
a
black
howler
monkey
sitting
motionless
in
a
tree
top
we
also
saw
the
about
the
size
of
our
blacktail
it
is
a
real
swamp
animal
for
we
found
it
often
in
the
and
out
in
the
open
marsh
in
the
water
among
the
aquatic
plants
the
tough
little
horses
bore
us
well
through
the
marsh
often
in
crossing
bayous
and
ponds
the
water
rose
almost
to
their
backs
but
they
splashed
and
waded
and
if
necessary
swam
through
the
dogs
were
a
set
some
were
of
distinctly
wolfish
appearance
these
we
were
assured
were
descended
in
part
from
the
big
red
wolf
of
the
neighborhood
a
tall
lank
animal
with
much
smaller
teeth
than
a
big
northern
wolf
the
domestic
dog
is
undoubtedly
descended
from
at
least
a
dozen
different
species
of
wild
dogs
wolves
and
jackals
some
of
them
probably
belonging
to
what
we
style
different
genera
the
degree
of
fecundity
or
lack
of
fecundity
between
different
species
varies
in
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
fashion
in
different
families
of
mammals
in
the
horse
family
for
instance
the
species
are
not
fertile
inter
se
whereas
among
the
oxen
species
seemingly
at
least
as
widely
separated
as
the
horse
ass
and
zebra
species
such
as
the
domestic
ox
bison
yak
and
gaur
breed
freely
together
and
their
offspring
are
fertile
the
lion
and
tiger
also
breed
together
and
produce
offspring
which
will
breed
with
either
parent
stock
and
tame
dogs
in
different
quarters
of
the
world
although
all
of
them
fertile
inter
se
are
in
many
cases
obviously
blood
kin
to
the
neighboring
wild
or
creatures
which
are
specifically
and
possibly
even
generically
distinct
from
one
another
the
big
red
wolf
of
the
south
american
plains
is
not
closely
related
to
the
northern
wolves
and
it
was
to
me
unexpected
to
find
it
interbreeding
with
ordinary
domestic
dogs
in
the
evenings
after
dinner
we
sat
in
the
bare
ranch
or
out
under
the
trees
in
the
hot
darkness
and
talked
of
many
things
natural
history
with
the
naturalists
and
all
kinds
of
other
subjects
both
with
them
and
with
our
brazilian
friends
colonel
rondon
is
not
simply
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
in
the
sense
that
is
honorably
true
of
the
best
army
officers
in
every
good
military
service
he
is
also
a
peculiarly
hardy
and
competent
explorer
a
good
field
naturalist
and
scientific
man
a
student
and
a
philosopher
with
him
the
conversation
ranged
from
and
the
perils
of
exploration
in
the
matto
grosso
the
great
wilderness
to
indian
anthropology
to
the
dangers
of
a
purely
materialistic
industrial
civilization
and
to
positivist
morality
the
colonel
positivism
was
in
very
fact
to
him
a
religion
of
humanity
a
creed
which
bade
him
be
just
and
kindly
and
useful
to
his
fellow
men
to
live
his
life
bravely
and
no
less
bravely
to
face
death
without
reference
to
what
he
believed
or
did
not
believe
or
to
what
the
unknown
hereafter
might
hold
for
him
the
native
hunters
who
accompanied
us
were
swarthy
men
of
mixed
blood
they
were
barefooted
and
scantily
clad
and
each
carried
a
long
clumsy
spear
and
a
keen
machete
in
the
use
of
which
he
was
an
expert
now
and
then
in
thick
jungle
we
had
to
cut
out
a
path
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
one
of
them
although
cumbered
by
his
unwieldy
spear
handling
his
little
horse
with
complete
ease
while
he
hacked
at
limbs
and
branches
of
the
two
ordinarily
with
us
one
was
much
the
younger
and
whenever
we
came
to
an
unusually
looking
ford
or
piece
of
boggy
ground
the
elder
man
always
sent
the
younger
one
on
and
sat
on
the
bank
until
he
saw
what
befell
the
experimenter
in
that
rather
preposterous
book
of
our
youth
the
swiss
family
robinson
mention
is
made
of
a
tame
monkey
called
nips
which
was
used
to
test
all
things
as
to
the
healthfulness
of
which
the
adventurers
felt
doubtful
and
because
of
the
obvious
resemblance
of
function
we
christened
this
younger
hunter
nips
our
guides
were
not
only
hunters
but
the
coarse
dead
grass
is
burned
to
make
room
for
the
green
young
grass
on
which
the
cattle
thrive
every
now
and
then
one
of
the
men
as
he
rode
ahead
of
us
without
leaving
the
saddle
would
drop
a
lighted
match
into
a
tussock
of
tall
dead
blades
and
even
as
we
who
were
behind
rode
by
tongues
of
hot
flame
would
be
shooting
up
and
a
local
prairie
fire
would
have
started
kermit
took
nips
off
with
him
for
a
solitary
hunt
one
day
he
shot
two
of
the
big
a
buck
and
a
doe
and
preserved
them
as
museum
specimens
they
were
in
the
papyrus
growth
but
their
stomachs
contained
only
the
fine
which
grows
in
the
water
and
on
the
land
along
the
edges
of
the
swamps
the
papyrus
was
used
only
for
cover
not
for
food
the
buck
had
two
big
beside
the
nostrils
in
the
doe
these
were
rudimentary
on
this
day
kermit
also
came
across
a
herd
of
the
big
fierce
peccary
at
the
sound
of
their
grunting
nips
promptly
spurred
his
horse
and
took
to
his
heels
explaining
that
the
peccaries
would
charge
them
hamstring
the
horses
and
kill
the
riders
kermit
went
into
the
jungle
after
the
truculent
little
wild
hogs
on
foot
and
followed
them
for
an
hour
but
never
was
able
to
catch
sight
of
them
in
the
afternoon
of
this
same
day
one
of
the
merely
ranch
hands
who
knew
something
of
the
chase
of
the
jaguar
who
had
been
searching
for
tracks
rode
in
with
the
information
that
he
had
found
fresh
sign
at
a
spot
in
the
swamp
about
nine
miles
distant
next
morning
we
rose
at
two
and
had
started
on
our
at
three
colonel
rondon
kermit
and
i
with
the
two
trailers
or
hunters
made
up
the
party
each
on
a
weedy
undersized
marsh
pony
accustomed
to
traversing
the
vast
stretches
of
morass
and
we
were
accompanied
by
a
brown
boy
with
holding
our
lunch
who
rode
a
trotting
steer
which
he
managed
by
a
string
through
its
nostril
and
lip
the
two
trailers
carried
each
a
long
clumsy
spear
we
had
a
rather
poor
pack
besides
our
own
two
dogs
neither
of
which
was
used
to
there
were
the
ranch
dogs
which
were
worthless
and
then
two
jaguar
hounds
borrowed
for
the
occasion
from
a
ranch
six
or
eight
leagues
distant
these
were
the
only
hounds
on
which
we
could
place
any
trust
and
they
were
led
in
leashes
by
the
two
trailers
one
was
a
white
bitch
the
other
the
best
one
we
had
was
a
gelded
black
dog
they
were
lean
creatures
with
prick
ears
and
a
look
of
furtive
wildness
as
our
shabby
little
horses
shuffled
away
from
the
the
stars
were
brilliant
and
the
southern
cross
hung
well
up
in
the
heavens
tilted
to
the
right
the
landscape
was
spectral
in
the
light
of
the
waning
moon
at
the
first
shallow
ford
as
horses
and
dogs
splashed
across
an
alligator
the
some
five
feet
long
floated
unconcernedly
among
the
splashing
hoofs
and
paws
evidently
at
night
it
did
not
fear
us
hour
after
hour
we
slogged
along
then
the
night
grew
ghostly
with
the
first
dim
gray
of
the
dawn
the
sky
had
become
overcast
the
sun
rose
red
and
angry
through
broken
clouds
his
disk
flamed
behind
the
tall
slender
columns
of
the
palms
and
lit
the
waste
fields
of
papyrus
the
black
monkeys
howled
mournfully
the
birds
awoke
macaws
parrots
parakeets
screamed
at
us
and
chattered
at
us
as
we
rode
by
ibis
called
with
wailing
voices
and
the
plovers
shrieked
as
they
wheeled
in
the
air
we
waded
across
bayous
and
ponds
where
white
lilies
floated
on
the
water
and
thronging
splashed
the
green
marsh
with
color
at
last
on
the
edge
of
a
patch
of
jungle
in
wet
ground
we
came
on
fresh
jaguar
tracks
both
the
jaguar
hounds
challenged
the
sign
they
were
unleashed
and
galloped
along
the
trail
while
the
other
dogs
noisily
accompanied
them
the
hunt
led
right
through
the
marsh
evidently
the
jaguar
had
not
the
least
distaste
for
water
probably
it
had
been
hunting
for
capybaras
or
tapirs
and
it
had
gone
straight
through
ponds
and
long
winding
narrow
ditches
or
bayous
where
it
must
now
and
then
have
had
to
swim
for
a
stroke
or
two
it
had
also
wandered
through
the
stretches
of
land
the
trees
at
this
point
being
mostly
palms
and
tarumans
the
taruman
is
almost
as
big
as
a
with
glossy
foliage
and
a
fruit
like
an
olive
the
pace
quickened
the
motley
pack
burst
into
yelling
and
howling
and
then
a
sudden
quickening
of
the
note
showed
that
the
game
had
either
climbed
a
tree
or
turned
to
bay
in
a
thicket
the
former
proved
to
be
the
case
the
dogs
had
entered
a
patch
of
tall
tree
jungle
and
as
we
cantered
up
through
the
marsh
we
saw
the
jaguar
high
among
the
forked
limbs
of
a
taruman
tree
it
was
a
beautiful
picture
the
spotted
coat
of
the
big
lithe
formidable
cat
fairly
shone
as
it
snarled
defiance
at
the
pack
below
i
did
not
trust
the
pack
the
dogs
were
not
stanch
and
if
the
jaguar
came
down
and
started
i
feared
we
might
lose
it
so
i
fired
at
once
from
a
distance
of
seventy
yards
i
was
using
my
favorite
rifle
the
little
springfield
with
which
i
have
killed
most
kinds
of
african
game
from
the
lion
and
elephant
down
the
bullets
were
the
sharp
pointed
kind
with
the
end
of
naked
lead
at
the
shot
the
jaguar
fell
like
a
sack
of
sand
through
the
branches
and
although
it
staggered
to
its
feet
it
went
but
a
score
of
yards
before
it
sank
down
and
when
i
came
up
it
was
dead
under
the
palms
with
three
or
four
of
the
bolder
dogs
riving
at
it
the
jaguar
is
the
king
of
south
american
game
ranking
on
an
equality
with
the
noblest
beasts
of
the
chase
of
north
america
and
behind
only
the
huge
and
fierce
creatures
which
stand
at
the
head
of
the
big
game
of
africa
and
asia
this
one
was
an
adult
female
it
was
heavier
and
more
powerful
than
a
male
cougar
or
african
panther
or
leopard
it
was
a
big
powerfully
built
creature
giving
the
same
effect
of
strength
that
a
tiger
or
lion
does
and
that
the
lithe
leopards
and
pumas
do
not
its
flesh
by
the
way
proved
good
eating
when
we
had
it
for
supper
although
it
was
not
cooked
in
the
way
it
ought
to
have
been
i
tried
it
because
i
had
found
cougars
such
good
eating
i
have
always
regretted
that
in
africa
i
did
not
try
flesh
which
i
am
sure
must
be
excellent
next
day
came
kermit
turn
we
had
the
miscellaneous
pack
with
us
all
much
enjoying
themselves
but
although
they
could
help
in
a
to
the
extent
of
giving
tongue
and
following
the
chase
for
half
a
mile
cowing
the
quarry
by
their
clamor
they
were
not
sufficiently
stanch
to
be
of
use
if
there
was
any
difficulty
in
the
hunt
the
only
two
dogs
we
could
trust
were
the
two
borrowed
jaguar
hounds
this
was
the
black
dog
day
about
ten
in
the
morning
we
came
to
a
long
deep
winding
bayou
on
the
opposite
bank
stood
a
capybara
looking
like
a
pig
its
wet
hide
shining
black
i
killed
it
and
it
slid
into
the
water
then
i
found
that
the
bayou
extended
for
a
mile
or
two
in
each
direction
and
the
two
said
they
did
not
wish
to
swim
across
for
fear
of
the
piranhas
just
at
this
moment
we
came
across
fresh
jaguar
tracks
it
was
hot
we
had
been
travelling
for
five
hours
and
the
dogs
were
much
exhausted
the
black
hound
in
particular
was
nearly
done
up
for
he
had
been
led
in
a
leash
by
one
of
the
horsemen
he
lay
flat
on
the
ground
panting
unable
to
catch
the
scent
kermit
threw
water
over
him
and
when
he
was
thoroughly
drenched
and
freshened
thrust
his
nose
into
the
jaguar
footprints
the
game
old
hound
at
once
and
eagerly
responded
as
he
snuffed
the
scent
he
challenged
loudly
while
still
lying
down
then
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
started
on
the
trail
going
stronger
with
every
leap
evidently
the
big
cat
was
not
far
distant
soon
we
found
where
it
had
swum
across
the
bayou
piranhas
or
no
piranhas
we
now
intended
to
get
across
and
we
tried
to
force
our
horses
in
at
what
seemed
a
likely
spot
the
matted
growth
of
with
their
leathery
slippery
stems
formed
an
unpleasant
barrier
as
the
water
was
for
the
horses
the
latter
were
very
unwilling
to
attempt
the
passage
kermit
finally
forced
his
horse
through
the
tangled
mass
swimming
plunging
and
struggling
he
left
a
lane
of
clear
water
through
which
we
swam
after
him
the
dogs
splashed
and
swam
behind
us
on
the
other
bank
they
struck
the
fresh
trail
and
followed
it
at
a
run
it
led
into
a
long
belt
of
timber
chiefly
composed
of
nacury
palms
with
long
drooping
fronded
branches
in
silhouette
they
suggest
coarse
bamboos
the
nuts
hang
in
big
clusters
and
look
like
bunches
of
small
unripe
bananas
among
the
lower
palms
were
scattered
some
big
ordinary
trees
we
cantered
along
outside
the
timber
belt
listening
to
the
dogs
within
and
in
a
moment
a
burst
of
yelling
clamor
from
the
pack
told
that
the
jaguar
was
afoot
these
few
minutes
are
the
really
exciting
moments
in
the
chase
with
hounds
of
any
big
cat
that
will
tree
the
furious
baying
of
the
pack
the
shouts
and
cheers
of
encouragement
from
the
galloping
horsemen
the
wilderness
surroundings
the
knowledge
of
what
the
quarry
is
all
combine
to
make
the
moment
one
of
fierce
and
thrilling
excitement
besides
in
this
case
there
was
the
possibility
the
jaguar
might
come
to
bay
on
the
ground
in
which
event
there
would
be
a
slight
element
of
risk
as
it
might
need
straight
shooting
to
stop
a
charge
however
about
as
soon
as
the
howling
and
eager
yelping
showed
that
the
jaguar
had
been
overtaken
we
saw
him
a
huge
male
up
in
the
branches
of
a
great
a
bullet
behind
the
shoulder
from
kermit
winchester
brought
him
dead
to
the
ground
he
was
heavier
than
the
very
big
male
cougar
i
shot
in
colorado
whose
skull
hart
merriam
reported
as
the
biggest
he
had
ever
seen
he
was
very
nearly
double
the
weight
of
any
of
the
male
african
leopards
we
shot
he
was
nearly
or
quite
the
weight
of
the
smallest
of
the
adult
african
lionesses
we
shot
while
in
africa
he
had
the
big
bones
the
stout
frame
and
the
heavy
muscular
build
of
a
small
lion
he
was
not
lithe
and
slender
and
long
like
a
cougar
or
leopard
the
tail
as
with
all
jaguars
was
short
while
the
girth
of
the
body
was
great
his
coat
was
beautiful
with
a
satiny
gloss
and
the
spots
on
the
gold
of
his
back
head
and
sides
were
hardly
as
conspicuous
as
the
black
of
the
equally
spots
against
his
white
belly
this
was
a
jaguar
he
had
occasionally
indulged
in
killing
on
one
occasion
during
the
floods
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
near
the
and
had
killed
a
couple
of
cows
and
a
young
steer
the
hunters
had
followed
him
but
he
had
made
his
escape
and
for
the
time
being
had
abandoned
the
neighborhood
in
these
marshes
each
jaguar
had
a
wide
irregular
range
and
travelled
a
good
deal
perhaps
only
passing
a
day
or
two
in
a
given
locality
perhaps
spending
a
week
where
game
was
plentiful
jaguars
love
the
water
they
drink
greedily
and
swim
freely
in
this
country
they
rambled
through
the
night
across
the
marshes
and
prowled
along
the
edges
of
the
ponds
and
bayous
catching
the
capybaras
and
the
caymans
for
these
small
pond
caymans
the
form
part
of
their
habitual
food
and
a
big
jaguar
when
hungry
will
attack
and
kill
large
caymans
and
crocodiles
if
he
can
get
them
a
few
yards
from
the
water
on
these
marshes
the
jaguars
also
followed
the
peccary
herds
it
is
said
that
they
always
strike
the
hindmost
of
a
band
of
the
fierce
little
wild
pigs
elsewhere
they
often
prey
on
the
tapir
if
in
timber
however
the
jaguar
must
kill
it
at
once
for
the
squat
shaped
tapir
has
no
respect
for
timber
as
colonel
rondon
phrased
it
and
rushes
with
such
blind
headlong
speed
through
and
among
branches
and
trunks
that
if
not
immediately
killed
it
brushes
the
jaguar
off
the
claws
leaving
long
raking
scars
in
the
tough
hide
cattle
are
often
killed
the
jaguar
will
not
meddle
with
a
big
bull
and
is
cautious
about
attacking
a
herd
accompanied
by
a
bull
but
it
will
at
times
where
wild
game
is
scarce
kill
every
other
domestic
animal
it
is
a
thirsty
brute
and
if
it
kills
far
from
water
will
often
drag
its
victim
a
long
distance
toward
a
pond
or
stream
colonel
rondon
had
once
come
across
a
horse
which
a
jaguar
had
thus
killed
and
dragged
for
over
a
mile
jaguars
also
stalk
and
kill
the
deer
in
this
neighborhood
they
seemed
to
be
less
habitual
than
the
cougars
whether
this
is
generally
the
case
i
can
not
say
they
have
been
known
to
pounce
on
and
devour
anacondas
in
this
particular
neighborhood
the
ordinary
jaguars
molested
the
cattle
and
horses
hardly
at
all
except
now
and
then
to
kill
calves
it
was
only
occasionally
that
under
special
circumstances
some
old
male
took
to
there
were
plenty
of
capybaras
and
deer
and
evidently
the
big
spotted
cats
preferred
the
easier
prey
when
it
was
available
exactly
as
in
east
africa
we
found
the
lions
living
almost
exclusively
on
zebra
and
antelope
and
not
molesting
the
buffalo
and
domestic
cattle
which
in
other
parts
of
africa
furnish
their
habitual
prey
in
some
other
neighborhoods
not
far
distant
our
hosts
informed
us
that
the
jaguars
lived
almost
exclusively
on
horses
and
cattle
they
also
told
us
that
the
cougars
had
the
same
habits
as
the
jaguars
except
that
they
did
not
prey
on
such
big
animals
the
cougars
on
this
ranch
never
molested
the
foals
a
fact
which
astonished
me
as
in
the
rockies
they
are
the
worst
enemies
of
foals
it
was
interesting
to
find
that
my
hosts
and
the
hunters
and
ranch
workers
combined
special
knowledge
of
many
of
the
habits
of
these
big
cats
with
a
curious
ignorance
of
other
matters
concerning
them
and
a
readiness
to
believe
fables
about
them
this
was
precisely
what
i
had
found
to
be
the
case
with
the
north
american
hunters
in
discussing
the
puma
bear
and
wolf
and
with
the
english
and
boer
hunters
of
africa
when
they
spoke
of
the
lion
and
rhinoceros
until
the
habit
of
scientific
accuracy
in
observation
and
record
is
achieved
and
until
specimens
are
preserved
and
carefully
compared
entirely
truthful
men
at
home
in
the
wilderness
will
accept
and
repeat
as
matters
of
gospel
faith
theories
which
split
the
grizzly
and
black
bears
of
each
locality
in
the
united
states
and
the
lions
and
black
rhinos
of
south
africa
or
the
jaguars
and
pumas
of
any
portion
of
south
america
into
several
different
species
all
with
widely
different
habits
they
will
moreover
describe
these
imaginary
habits
with
such
sincerity
and
minuteness
that
they
deceive
most
listeners
and
the
result
sometimes
is
that
an
otherwise
good
naturalist
will
perpetuate
these
fables
as
hudson
did
when
he
wrote
of
the
puma
hudson
was
a
capital
observer
and
writer
when
he
dealt
with
the
ordinary
birds
and
mammals
of
the
districts
near
buenos
aires
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
wilderness
this
is
no
reflection
on
him
his
books
are
great
favorites
of
mine
and
are
to
a
large
degree
models
of
what
such
books
should
be
i
only
wish
that
there
were
hundreds
of
such
writers
and
observers
who
would
give
us
similar
books
for
all
parts
of
america
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
accept
him
as
an
authority
on
that
concerning
which
he
was
ignorant
an
interesting
incident
occurred
on
the
day
we
killed
our
first
jaguar
we
took
our
lunch
beside
a
small
but
deep
and
obviously
permanent
pond
i
went
to
the
edge
to
dip
up
some
water
and
something
growled
or
bellowed
at
me
only
a
few
feet
away
it
was
a
or
small
cayman
about
five
feet
long
i
paid
no
heed
to
it
at
the
moment
but
shortly
afterward
when
our
horses
went
down
to
drink
it
threatened
them
and
frightened
them
and
then
colonel
rondon
and
kermit
called
me
to
watch
it
it
lay
on
the
surface
of
the
water
only
a
few
feet
distant
from
us
and
threatened
us
we
threw
cakes
of
mud
at
it
whereupon
it
clashed
its
jaws
and
made
short
rushes
at
us
and
when
we
threw
sticks
it
seized
them
and
crunched
them
we
could
not
drive
it
away
why
it
should
have
shown
such
truculence
and
heedlessness
i
can
not
imagine
unless
perhaps
it
was
a
female
with
eggs
near
by
in
another
little
pond
a
showed
no
less
anger
when
another
of
my
companions
approached
it
bellowed
opened
its
jaws
and
lashed
its
tail
yet
these
pond
jacares
never
actually
molested
even
our
dogs
in
the
ponds
far
less
us
on
our
horses
this
same
day
others
of
our
party
had
an
interesting
experience
with
the
creatures
in
another
pond
one
of
them
was
commander
da
cunha
of
the
brazilian
navy
a
capital
sportsman
and
delightful
companion
they
found
a
deepish
pond
a
hundred
yards
or
so
long
and
thirty
or
forty
across
it
was
tenanted
by
the
small
caymans
and
by
capybaras
the
largest
known
rodent
a
huge
aquatic
the
size
of
a
small
sheep
it
also
swarmed
with
piranhas
the
ravenous
fish
of
which
i
have
so
often
spoken
undoubtedly
the
caymans
were
subsisting
largely
on
these
piranhas
but
the
tables
were
readily
turned
if
any
caymans
were
injured
when
a
capybara
was
shot
and
sank
in
the
water
the
piranhas
at
once
attacked
it
and
had
eaten
half
the
carcass
ten
minutes
later
but
much
more
extraordinary
was
the
fact
that
when
a
cayman
about
five
feet
long
was
wounded
the
piranhas
attacked
and
tore
it
and
actually
drove
it
out
on
the
bank
to
face
its
human
foes
the
fish
first
attacked
the
wound
then
as
the
blood
maddened
them
they
attacked
all
the
soft
parts
their
terrible
teeth
cutting
out
chunks
of
tough
hide
and
flesh
evidently
they
did
not
molest
either
cayman
or
capybara
while
it
was
unwounded
but
blood
excited
them
to
frenzy
their
habits
are
in
some
ways
inexplicable
we
saw
men
frequently
bathing
unmolested
but
there
are
places
where
this
is
never
safe
and
in
any
place
if
a
school
of
the
fish
appear
swimmers
are
in
danger
and
a
wounded
man
or
beast
is
in
deadly
peril
if
piranhas
are
in
the
neighborhood
ordinarily
it
appears
that
an
unwounded
man
is
attacked
only
by
accident
such
accidents
are
rare
but
they
happen
with
sufficient
frequency
to
justify
much
caution
in
entering
water
where
piranhas
abound
we
frequently
came
across
ponds
tenanted
by
numbers
of
capybaras
the
huge
rodents
are
said
to
be
shy
elsewhere
here
they
were
tame
the
water
was
their
home
and
refuge
they
usually
went
ashore
to
feed
on
the
grass
and
made
trails
in
the
marsh
immediately
around
the
water
but
they
must
have
travelled
these
at
night
for
we
never
saw
them
more
than
a
few
feet
away
from
the
water
in
the
daytime
even
at
midday
we
often
came
on
them
standing
beside
a
bayou
or
pond
the
dogs
would
rush
wildly
at
such
a
standing
beast
which
would
wait
until
they
were
only
a
few
yards
off
and
then
dash
into
and
under
the
water
the
dogs
would
also
run
full
tilt
into
the
water
and
it
was
then
really
funny
to
see
their
surprise
and
disappointment
at
the
sudden
and
complete
disappearance
of
their
quarry
often
a
capybara
would
stand
or
sit
on
its
haunches
in
the
water
with
only
its
blunt
head
above
the
surface
quite
heedless
of
our
presence
but
if
alarmed
it
would
dive
for
capybaras
swim
with
equal
facility
on
or
below
the
surface
and
if
they
wish
to
hide
they
rise
gently
among
the
rushes
or
leaves
with
only
their
nostrils
exposed
in
these
waters
the
capybaras
and
small
caymans
paid
no
attention
to
one
another
swimming
and
resting
in
close
proximity
they
both
had
the
same
enemy
the
jaguar
the
capybara
is
a
game
animal
only
in
the
sense
that
a
hare
or
rabbit
is
the
flesh
is
good
to
eat
and
its
amphibious
habits
and
queer
nature
and
surroundings
make
it
interesting
in
some
of
the
ponds
the
water
had
about
gone
and
the
capybaras
had
become
for
the
time
being
beasts
of
the
marsh
and
the
mud
although
they
could
always
find
little
slimy
pools
under
a
mass
of
in
which
to
lie
and
hide
our
whole
stay
on
this
ranch
was
delightful
on
the
long
rides
we
always
saw
something
of
interest
and
often
it
was
something
entirely
new
to
us
early
one
morning
we
came
across
two
armadillos
the
big
armadillo
we
were
riding
with
the
pack
through
a
dry
sandy
pasture
country
dotted
with
clumps
of
palms
round
the
trunks
of
which
grew
a
dense
jungle
of
thorns
and
spanish
bayonets
the
armadillos
were
feeding
in
an
open
space
between
two
of
these
jungle
clumps
which
were
about
a
hundred
yards
apart
one
was
on
all
fours
the
other
was
in
a
squatting
position
with
its
fore
legs
off
the
ground
their
long
ears
were
very
prominent
the
dogs
raced
at
them
i
had
always
supposed
that
armadillos
merely
shuffled
along
and
curled
up
for
protection
when
menaced
and
i
was
almost
as
surprised
as
if
i
had
seen
a
turtle
gallop
when
these
two
armadillos
bounded
off
at
a
run
going
as
fast
as
rabbits
one
headed
back
for
the
nearest
patch
of
jungle
which
it
reached
the
other
ran
at
full
speed
and
ran
really
fast
too
until
it
nearly
reached
the
other
patch
a
hundred
yards
distant
the
dogs
in
full
cry
immediately
behind
it
then
it
suddenly
changed
its
mind
wheeled
in
its
tracks
and
came
back
like
a
bullet
right
through
the
pack
dog
after
dog
tried
to
seize
it
or
stop
it
and
turned
to
pursue
it
but
its
snout
and
armored
body
joined
to
the
speed
at
which
it
was
galloping
enabled
it
to
drive
straight
ahead
through
its
pursuers
not
one
of
which
could
halt
it
or
grasp
it
and
it
reached
in
safety
its
thorny
haven
of
refuge
it
had
run
at
speed
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
i
was
much
impressed
by
this
unexpected
exhibition
evidently
this
species
of
armadillo
only
curls
up
as
a
last
resort
and
ordinarily
trusts
to
its
speed
and
to
the
protection
its
build
and
its
armor
give
it
while
running
in
order
to
reach
its
burrow
or
other
place
of
safety
twice
while
laying
railway
tracks
near
sao
paulo
kermit
had
accidentally
dug
up
armadillos
with
a
there
were
big
some
of
them
of
huge
dimensions
scattered
through
the
country
sometimes
they
were
built
against
the
stems
of
trees
we
did
not
here
come
across
any
of
the
poisonous
or
biting
ants
which
when
sufficiently
numerous
render
certain
districts
uninhabitable
they
are
ordinarily
not
very
numerous
those
of
them
that
march
in
large
bodies
kill
nestling
birds
and
at
once
destroy
any
big
animal
unable
to
get
out
of
their
way
it
has
been
suggested
that
nestlings
in
their
nests
are
in
some
way
immune
from
the
attack
of
these
ants
the
experiments
of
our
naturalists
tended
to
show
that
this
was
not
the
case
they
plundered
any
nest
they
came
across
and
could
get
at
once
we
saw
a
small
herd
of
peccaries
one
a
sow
followed
by
three
little
pigs
they
are
said
to
have
only
two
young
but
we
saw
three
although
of
course
it
is
possible
one
belonged
to
another
sow
the
herd
galloped
into
a
mass
of
thorny
cover
the
hounds
could
not
penetrate
and
when
they
were
in
safety
we
heard
them
utter
from
the
depths
of
the
jungle
a
curious
moaning
sound
on
one
ride
we
passed
a
clump
of
palms
which
were
fairly
ablaze
with
bird
color
there
were
magnificent
hyacinth
macaws
green
parrots
with
red
splashes
toucans
with
varied
plumage
black
white
red
yellow
green
jacmars
flaming
orioles
and
both
blue
and
tanagers
it
was
an
extraordinary
collection
all
were
noisy
perhaps
there
was
a
snake
that
had
drawn
them
by
its
presence
but
we
could
find
no
snake
the
assembly
dispersed
as
we
rode
up
the
huge
blue
macaws
departed
in
pairs
uttering
their
hoarse
it
has
been
said
that
parrots
in
the
wilderness
are
only
noisy
on
the
wing
they
are
certainly
noisy
on
the
wing
and
those
that
we
saw
were
quiet
while
they
were
feeding
but
ordinarily
when
they
were
perched
among
the
branches
and
especially
when
as
in
the
case
of
the
little
parakeets
near
the
house
they
were
gathering
materials
for
they
were
just
as
noisy
as
while
flying
the
were
always
a
delight
we
shot
merely
the
two
or
three
specimens
the
naturalists
needed
for
the
museum
i
killed
a
on
the
wing
with
the
handy
little
springfield
and
then
lost
all
the
credit
i
had
thus
gained
by
a
series
of
inexcusable
misses
at
long
range
before
i
finally
killed
a
jabiru
kermit
shot
a
jabiru
with
the
luger
automatic
the
great
splendid
birds
standing
about
as
tall
as
a
man
show
fight
when
wounded
and
advance
against
their
assailants
clattering
their
formidable
bills
one
day
we
found
the
nest
of
a
jabiru
in
a
mighty
on
the
edge
of
a
patch
of
jungle
it
was
a
big
platform
of
sticks
placed
on
a
horizontal
branch
there
were
four
young
standing
on
it
we
passed
it
in
the
morning
when
both
parents
were
also
perched
alongside
the
sky
was
then
overcast
and
it
was
not
possible
to
photograph
it
with
the
small
camera
in
the
early
afternoon
when
we
again
passed
it
the
sun
was
out
and
we
tried
to
get
photographs
only
one
parent
bird
was
present
at
this
time
it
showed
no
fear
i
noticed
that
as
it
stood
on
a
branch
near
the
nest
its
bill
was
slightly
open
it
was
very
hot
and
i
suppose
it
had
opened
its
bill
just
as
a
hen
opens
her
bill
in
hot
weather
as
we
rode
away
the
old
bird
and
the
four
young
birds
were
standing
motionless
and
with
gliding
flight
the
other
old
bird
was
returning
to
the
nest
it
is
hard
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
wealth
of
bird
life
in
these
marshes
a
naturalist
could
with
the
utmost
advantage
spend
six
months
on
such
a
branch
as
that
we
visited
he
would
have
to
do
some
collecting
but
only
a
little
exhaustive
observation
in
the
field
is
what
is
now
most
needed
most
of
this
wonderful
and
harmless
bird
life
should
be
protected
by
law
and
the
mammals
should
receive
reasonable
protection
the
books
now
most
needed
are
those
dealing
with
the
of
wild
creatures
near
the
walking
familiarly
among
the
cattle
we
saw
the
big
ani
blackbirds
they
feed
on
the
insects
disturbed
by
the
hoofs
of
the
cattle
and
often
cling
to
them
and
pick
off
the
ticks
it
was
the
end
of
the
nesting
season
and
we
did
not
find
their
curious
communal
nests
in
which
half
a
dozen
females
lay
their
eggs
indiscriminately
the
common
ibises
in
the
ponds
near
by
which
usually
went
in
pairs
instead
of
in
flocks
like
the
wood
ibis
were
very
tame
and
so
were
the
night
herons
and
all
the
small
herons
in
flying
the
ibises
and
storks
stretch
the
neck
straight
in
front
of
them
the
jabiru
a
splendid
bird
on
the
wing
also
stretches
his
neck
out
in
front
but
there
appears
to
be
a
slight
downward
curve
at
the
base
of
the
neck
which
may
be
due
merely
to
the
craw
the
big
slender
herons
on
the
contrary
bend
the
long
neck
back
in
a
beautiful
curve
so
that
the
head
is
nearly
between
the
shoulders
one
day
i
saw
what
i
at
first
thought
was
a
small
kingfisher
hovering
over
a
pond
and
finally
plunging
down
to
the
surface
of
the
water
after
a
school
of
tiny
young
fish
but
it
proved
to
be
a
birds
the
size
and
somewhat
the
coloration
of
veeries
but
with
long
slender
were
common
in
the
little
garden
back
of
the
house
their
habits
were
those
of
creepers
and
they
scrambled
with
agility
up
along
and
under
the
trunks
and
branches
and
along
the
posts
and
rails
of
the
fence
thrusting
the
bill
into
crevices
for
insects
the
which
had
the
carriage
and
somewhat
the
look
of
i
am
sure
would
prove
delightful
friends
on
a
close
acquaintance
they
are
very
individual
not
only
in
the
extraordinary
domed
mud
nests
they
build
but
in
all
their
ways
in
their
bright
alertness
their
interest
in
and
curiosity
about
whatever
goes
on
their
rather
jerky
quickness
of
movement
and
their
loud
and
varied
calls
with
a
little
encouragement
they
become
tame
and
familiar
the
parakeets
were
too
noisy
but
otherwise
were
most
attractive
little
birds
as
they
flew
to
and
fro
and
scrambled
about
in
the
top
of
the
palm
behind
the
house
there
was
one
showy
kind
of
or
tyrant
flycatcher
lustrous
black
with
a
white
head
one
afternoon
several
score
cattle
were
driven
into
a
big
square
corral
near
the
house
in
order
to
brand
the
calves
and
a
number
of
unbranded
yearlings
and
a
special
element
of
excitement
was
added
by
the
presence
of
a
dozen
big
bulls
which
were
to
be
turned
into
the
agility
nerve
and
prowess
of
the
ranch
workmen
the
herders
or
gauchos
were
noteworthy
the
men
were
obviously
mainly
of
indian
and
negro
descent
although
some
of
them
also
showed
a
strong
strain
of
white
blood
they
wore
the
usual
shirt
trousers
and
fringed
leather
apron
with
hats
their
bare
feet
must
have
been
literally
as
tough
as
horn
for
when
one
of
them
roped
a
big
bull
he
would
brace
himself
bending
back
until
he
was
almost
sitting
down
and
digging
his
heels
into
the
ground
and
the
galloping
beast
would
be
stopped
short
and
whirled
completely
round
when
the
rope
tautened
the
maddened
bulls
and
an
occasional
steer
or
cow
charged
again
and
again
with
furious
wrath
but
two
or
three
ropes
would
settle
on
the
doomed
beast
and
down
it
would
go
and
when
it
was
released
and
rose
and
charged
once
more
with
greater
fury
than
ever
the
men
shouting
with
laughter
would
leap
up
the
sides
of
the
heavy
stockade
we
stayed
at
the
ranch
until
a
couple
of
days
before
christmas
hitherto
the
weather
had
been
lovely
the
night
before
we
left
there
was
a
torrential
tropic
downpour
it
was
not
unexpected
for
we
had
been
told
that
the
rainy
season
was
overdue
the
following
forenoon
the
baggage
started
in
a
couple
of
for
the
landing
where
the
steamboat
awaited
us
each
cart
was
drawn
by
eight
oxen
the
huge
wheels
were
over
seven
feet
high
early
in
the
afternoon
we
followed
on
horseback
and
overtook
the
carts
as
darkness
fell
just
before
we
reached
the
landing
on
the
river
bank
the
last
few
miles
after
the
final
reaches
of
higher
ground
had
been
passed
were
across
a
level
plain
of
low
ground
on
which
the
water
stood
sometimes
only
up
to
the
ankles
of
a
man
on
foot
sometimes
as
high
as
his
waist
directly
in
front
of
us
many
leagues
distant
rose
the
bold
mountains
that
lie
west
of
corumba
behind
them
the
sun
was
setting
and
kindled
the
overcast
heavens
with
lurid
splendor
then
the
last
rose
tints
faded
from
the
sky
the
horses
plodded
wearily
through
the
water
on
every
side
stretched
the
marsh
vast
lonely
desolate
in
the
gray
of
the
we
overtook
the
the
cattle
strained
in
the
yokes
the
drivers
wading
alongside
cracked
their
whips
and
uttered
strange
cries
the
carts
rocked
and
swayed
as
the
huge
wheels
churned
through
the
mud
and
water
as
the
last
light
faded
we
reached
the
small
patches
of
dry
land
at
the
landing
where
the
steamboat
was
moored
to
the
bank
the
tired
horses
and
oxen
were
turned
loose
to
graze
water
stood
in
the
corrals
but
the
open
shed
was
on
dry
ground
under
it
the
and
herders
slung
their
hammocks
and
close
by
they
lit
a
fire
and
roasted
or
scorched
slabs
and
legs
of
mutton
spitted
on
sticks
and
propped
above
the
smouldering
flame
next
morning
with
real
regret
we
waved
to
our
dusky
attendants
as
they
stood
on
the
bank
grouped
around
a
little
fire
beside
the
big
empty
a
dozen
miles
a
rowboat
fitted
for
a
put
off
from
the
bank
the
owner
a
countryman
from
a
small
ranch
asked
for
a
tow
to
corumba
which
we
gave
he
had
with
him
in
the
boat
his
comely
brown
wife
who
was
smoking
a
very
large
cigar
their
two
children
a
young
man
and
a
couple
of
trunks
and
various
other
belongings
on
christmas
eve
we
reached
corumba
and
rejoined
the
other
members
of
the
expedition
iv
the
headwaters
of
the
paraguay
at
corumba
our
entire
party
and
all
their
belongings
came
aboard
our
good
little
river
boat
the
nyoac
christmas
day
saw
us
making
our
way
steadily
against
the
strong
current
and
between
the
green
and
beautiful
banks
of
the
upper
paraguay
the
shallow
little
steamer
was
jammed
with
men
dogs
rifles
partially
cured
skins
boxes
of
provisions
ammunition
tools
and
photographic
supplies
bags
containing
tents
cots
bedding
and
clothes
saddles
hammocks
and
the
other
necessaries
for
a
trip
through
the
great
wilderness
the
matto
grosso
of
western
brazil
it
was
a
brilliantly
clear
day
and
although
of
course
in
that
latitude
and
at
that
season
the
heat
was
intense
later
on
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
in
the
early
morning
we
sat
on
the
forward
deck
admiring
the
trees
on
the
brink
of
the
sheer
river
banks
the
lush
rank
grass
of
the
marshes
and
the
many
the
two
pilots
one
black
and
one
white
stood
at
the
wheel
colonel
rondon
read
thomas
a
kempis
kermit
cherrie
and
miller
squatted
outside
the
railing
on
the
deck
over
one
and
put
the
final
touches
on
the
jaguar
skins
fiala
satisfied
himself
that
the
boxes
and
bags
were
in
place
it
was
probable
that
hardship
lay
in
the
future
but
the
day
was
our
own
and
the
day
was
pleasant
in
the
evening
the
open
all
around
where
we
dined
was
decorated
with
green
boughs
and
rushes
and
we
drank
the
health
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
president
of
brazil
now
and
then
we
passed
little
ranches
on
the
river
edge
this
is
a
fertile
land
pleasant
to
live
in
and
any
settler
who
is
willing
to
work
can
earn
his
living
there
are
mines
there
is
there
is
abundance
of
rich
soil
the
country
will
soon
be
opened
by
rail
it
offers
a
fine
field
for
immigration
and
for
agricultural
mining
and
business
development
and
it
has
a
great
future
cherrie
and
miller
had
secured
a
little
owl
a
month
before
in
the
chaco
and
it
was
travelling
with
them
in
a
basket
it
was
a
dear
little
bird
very
tame
and
affectionate
it
liked
to
be
handled
and
petted
and
when
miller
its
especial
protector
came
into
the
cabin
it
would
make
queer
little
noises
as
a
signal
that
it
wished
to
be
taken
up
and
perched
on
his
hand
cherrie
and
miller
had
trapped
many
mammals
among
them
was
a
tayra
weasel
whitish
above
and
black
below
as
big
and
as
a
and
a
tiny
opossum
no
bigger
than
a
mouse
they
had
taken
four
species
of
opossum
but
they
had
not
found
the
curious
which
they
had
obtained
on
the
rivers
flowing
into
the
caribbean
sea
this
opossum
which
is
black
and
white
swims
in
the
streams
like
a
muskrat
or
otter
catching
fish
and
living
in
burrows
which
open
under
water
miller
and
cherrie
were
puzzled
to
know
why
the
young
throve
leading
such
an
existence
of
constant
immersion
one
of
them
once
found
a
female
swimming
and
diving
freely
with
four
quite
young
in
her
pouch
we
saw
on
the
banks
screamers
big
crested
waders
of
archaic
type
with
spurred
wings
rather
short
bills
and
no
especial
affinities
with
other
modern
birds
in
one
meadow
by
a
pond
we
saw
three
deer
a
buck
and
two
does
they
stared
at
us
with
their
thickly
haired
tails
raised
on
end
these
tails
are
black
underneath
instead
of
white
as
in
our
whitetail
deer
one
of
the
vagaries
of
the
has
been
to
uphold
the
incidentally
quite
preposterous
theory
that
the
tail
of
our
deer
is
colored
white
beneath
so
as
to
harmonize
with
the
sky
and
thereby
mislead
the
cougar
or
wolf
at
the
critical
moment
when
it
makes
its
spring
but
this
shows
a
black
instead
of
a
white
flag
and
yet
has
just
as
much
need
of
protection
from
its
enemies
the
jaguar
and
the
cougar
in
south
america
concealing
coloration
plays
no
more
part
in
the
lives
of
the
adult
deer
the
tamandua
the
tapir
the
peccary
the
jaguar
and
the
puma
than
it
plays
in
africa
in
the
lives
of
such
animals
as
the
zebra
the
sable
antelope
the
wildebeeste
the
lion
and
the
hunting
hyena
next
day
we
spent
ascending
the
sao
lourenco
it
was
narrower
than
the
paraguay
naturally
and
the
swirling
brown
current
was
if
anything
more
rapid
the
strange
tropical
trees
standing
densely
on
the
banks
were
matted
together
by
long
bush
ropes
lianas
or
vines
some
very
slender
and
very
long
sometimes
we
saw
brilliant
red
or
blue
flowers
or
masses
of
scarlet
berries
on
a
queer
tree
or
an
array
of
great
white
blossoms
on
a
much
larger
tree
in
a
lagoon
bordered
by
the
taquara
bamboo
a
school
of
big
otters
were
playing
when
they
came
to
the
surface
they
opened
their
mouths
like
seals
and
made
a
loud
hissing
noise
the
crested
screamers
dark
gray
and
as
large
as
turkeys
perched
on
the
very
topmost
branches
of
the
tallest
trees
hyacinth
macaws
screamed
harshly
as
they
flew
across
the
river
among
the
trees
was
the
guan
another
peculiar
bird
as
big
as
a
big
grouse
and
with
certain
habits
of
the
but
not
akin
to
any
northern
the
windpipe
of
the
male
is
very
long
extending
down
to
the
end
of
the
and
the
bird
utters
queer
guttural
screams
a
dead
cayman
floated
with
a
black
vulture
devouring
it
capybaras
stood
or
squatted
on
the
banks
sometimes
they
stared
stupidly
at
us
sometimes
they
plunged
into
the
river
at
our
approach
at
long
intervals
we
passed
little
clearings
in
each
stood
a
house
of
with
a
steeply
pitched
roof
of
palm
thatch
and
near
by
were
patches
of
corn
and
mandioc
the
dusky
owner
and
perhaps
his
family
came
out
on
the
bank
to
watch
us
as
we
passed
it
was
a
hot
day
the
thermometer
on
the
deck
in
the
shade
stood
at
nearly
degrees
fahrenheit
biting
flies
came
aboard
even
when
we
were
in
midstream
next
day
we
were
ascending
the
cuyaba
river
it
had
begun
raining
in
the
night
and
the
heavy
downpour
continued
throughout
the
forenoon
in
the
morning
we
halted
at
a
big
to
get
fresh
milk
and
beef
there
were
various
houses
sheds
and
corrals
near
the
edge
and
fifty
or
sixty
milch
cows
were
gathered
in
one
corral
spurred
plover
or
lapwings
strolled
familiarly
among
the
hens
parakeets
and
tanagers
lit
in
the
trees
over
our
heads
a
kind
of
primitive
houseboat
was
moored
at
the
bank
a
woman
was
cooking
breakfast
over
a
little
stove
at
one
end
the
crew
were
ashore
the
boat
was
one
of
those
which
are
really
stores
and
which
travel
up
and
down
these
rivers
laden
with
what
the
natives
most
need
and
stopping
wherever
there
is
a
ranch
they
are
the
only
stores
which
many
of
the
see
from
year
end
to
year
end
they
float
and
are
poled
by
their
crew
or
now
and
then
get
a
tow
from
a
steamer
this
one
had
a
house
with
a
tin
roof
others
bear
houses
with
thatched
roofs
or
with
roofs
made
of
hides
the
river
wound
through
vast
marshes
broken
by
belts
of
woodland
always
the
two
naturalists
had
something
of
interest
to
tell
of
their
past
experience
suggested
by
some
bird
or
beast
we
came
across
black
and
golden
orioles
slightly
crested
of
two
different
species
were
found
along
the
river
they
nest
in
colonies
and
often
we
passed
such
colonies
the
long
pendulous
nests
hanging
from
the
boughs
of
trees
directly
over
the
water
cherrie
told
us
of
finding
such
a
colony
built
round
a
big
several
feet
in
diameter
these
wasps
are
venomous
and
irritable
and
few
foes
would
dare
venture
near
nests
that
were
under
such
formidable
shelter
but
the
birds
themselves
were
entirely
unafraid
and
obviously
were
not
in
any
danger
of
disagreement
with
their
dangerous
protectors
we
saw
a
dark
ibis
flying
across
the
bow
of
the
boat
uttering
his
deep
syllabled
note
miller
told
how
on
the
orinoco
these
ibises
plunder
the
nests
of
the
big
they
are
very
skilful
in
finding
where
the
female
turtle
has
laid
her
eggs
scratch
them
out
of
the
sand
break
the
shells
and
suck
the
contents
it
was
astonishing
to
find
so
few
mosquitoes
on
these
marshes
they
did
not
in
any
way
compare
as
pests
with
the
mosquitoes
on
the
lower
mississippi
the
new
jersey
coast
the
red
river
of
the
north
or
the
kootenay
back
in
the
forest
near
corumba
the
naturalists
had
found
them
very
bad
indeed
cherrie
had
spent
two
or
three
days
on
a
which
was
bare
of
forest
he
had
thought
there
would
be
few
mosquitoes
but
the
long
grass
harbored
them
they
often
swarm
in
long
grass
and
bush
even
where
there
is
no
water
and
at
night
they
were
such
a
torment
that
as
soon
as
the
sun
set
he
had
to
go
to
bed
under
his
yet
on
the
vast
marshes
they
were
not
seriously
troublesome
in
most
places
i
was
informed
that
they
were
not
in
any
way
a
bother
on
the
grassy
uplands
the
high
country
north
of
cuyaba
which
from
thence
stretches
eastward
to
the
coastal
region
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
this
inland
region
of
brazil
including
the
state
of
matto
grosso
which
we
were
traversing
is
a
healthy
region
excellently
adapted
to
settlement
railroads
will
speedily
penetrate
it
and
then
it
will
witness
an
astonishing
development
on
the
morning
of
the
we
reached
the
home
buildings
of
the
great
sao
joao
fazenda
the
ranch
of
senhor
joao
da
costa
marques
our
host
himself
and
his
son
dom
joao
the
younger
who
was
state
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
latter
charming
wife
and
the
president
of
matto
grosso
and
several
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
come
down
the
river
to
greet
us
from
the
city
of
cuyaba
several
hundred
miles
farther
as
usual
we
were
treated
with
and
generous
hospitality
some
miles
below
the
the
party
met
us
on
a
steamboat
and
a
launch
both
decked
with
many
flags
the
handsome
white
stood
only
a
few
rods
back
from
the
river
brink
in
a
grassy
opening
dotted
with
those
noble
trees
the
royal
palms
other
trees
buildings
of
all
kinds
fields
corrals
and
enclosures
with
high
white
walls
stood
near
the
house
a
detachment
of
soldiers
or
state
police
with
a
band
were
in
front
of
the
house
and
two
flagpoles
one
with
the
brazilian
flag
already
hoisted
the
american
flag
was
run
up
on
the
other
as
i
stepped
ashore
while
the
band
played
the
national
anthems
of
the
two
countries
the
house
held
much
comfort
and
the
comfort
was
all
the
more
appreciated
because
even
indoors
the
thermometer
stood
at
degrees
in
the
late
afternoon
heavy
rain
fell
and
cooled
the
air
we
were
riding
at
the
time
around
the
house
the
birds
were
tame
the
parrots
and
parakeets
crowded
and
chattered
in
the
tree
tops
jacanas
played
in
the
wet
ground
just
back
of
the
garden
ibises
and
screamers
called
loudly
in
the
swamps
a
little
distance
off
until
we
came
actually
in
sight
of
this
great
we
had
been
passing
through
a
hot
fertile
pleasant
wilderness
where
the
few
small
houses
each
in
its
little
patch
of
corn
and
mandioc
stood
very
many
miles
apart
one
of
these
little
houses
stood
on
an
old
indian
mound
exactly
like
the
mounds
which
form
the
only
hillocks
along
the
lower
mississippi
and
which
are
also
of
indian
origin
these
occasional
indian
mounds
made
ages
ago
are
the
highest
bits
of
ground
in
the
immense
swamps
of
the
upper
paraguay
region
there
are
still
indian
tribes
in
this
neighborhood
we
passed
an
indian
fishing
village
on
the
edge
of
the
river
with
huts
scaffoldings
for
drying
the
fish
hammocks
and
rude
tables
they
cultivated
patches
of
bananas
and
out
in
a
shallow
place
in
the
river
was
a
scaffolding
on
which
the
indians
stood
to
spear
fish
the
indians
were
friendly
peaceable
souls
for
the
most
part
dressed
like
the
poorer
classes
among
the
brazilians
next
morning
there
was
to
have
been
a
great
rodeo
or
and
we
determined
to
have
a
hunt
first
as
there
were
still
several
kinds
of
beasts
of
the
chase
notably
tapirs
and
peccaries
of
which
the
naturalists
desired
specimens
dom
joao
our
host
and
his
son
accompanied
us
theirs
is
a
noteworthy
family
born
in
matto
grosso
in
the
tropics
our
host
had
the
look
of
a
northerner
and
although
a
grandfather
he
possessed
an
abounding
vigor
and
energy
such
as
very
few
men
of
any
climate
or
surroundings
do
possess
all
of
his
sons
are
doing
well
the
son
who
was
with
us
was
a
stalwart
powerful
man
a
pleasant
companion
an
able
public
servant
a
finished
horseman
and
a
skilled
hunter
he
carried
a
sharp
spear
not
a
rifle
for
in
matto
grosso
it
is
the
custom
in
hunting
the
jaguar
for
riflemen
and
spearmen
to
go
in
at
him
together
when
he
turns
at
bay
the
spearman
holding
him
off
if
the
first
shot
fails
to
stop
him
so
that
another
shot
can
be
put
in
altogether
our
host
and
his
son
reminded
one
of
the
best
type
of
american
ranchmen
and
planters
of
those
planters
and
ranchmen
who
are
adepts
in
bold
and
manly
field
sports
who
are
capital
men
of
business
and
who
also
often
supply
to
the
state
skilled
and
faithful
public
servants
the
hospitality
the
father
and
son
extended
to
us
was
patriarchal
neither
for
instance
would
sit
at
table
with
their
guests
at
the
beginning
of
the
formal
meals
instead
they
exercised
a
close
personal
supervision
over
the
feast
our
charming
hostess
however
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
at
six
in
the
morning
we
started
all
of
us
on
fine
horses
the
day
was
lowering
and
overcast
a
dozen
dogs
were
with
us
but
only
one
or
two
were
worth
anything
three
or
four
ordinary
countrymen
the
ranch
hands
or
vaqueiros
accompanied
us
they
were
mainly
of
indian
blood
and
would
have
been
called
peons
or
caboclos
in
other
parts
of
brazil
but
here
were
always
spoken
to
and
of
as
camaradas
they
were
of
course
chosen
from
among
the
men
who
were
hunters
and
each
carried
his
long
rather
heavy
and
clumsy
in
front
rode
our
vigorous
host
and
his
strapping
son
the
latter
also
carrying
a
the
bridles
and
saddles
of
the
big
ranchmen
and
of
the
gentlefolk
generally
were
handsome
and
were
elaborately
ornamented
with
silver
the
stirrups
for
instance
were
not
only
of
silver
but
contained
so
much
extra
metal
in
ornamented
bars
and
rings
that
they
would
have
been
awkward
for
riders
indeed
as
it
was
they
were
adapted
only
for
the
tips
of
boots
with
long
pointed
toes
and
were
impossible
for
our
feet
our
hosts
stirrups
were
long
narrow
silver
slippers
the
camaradas
on
the
other
hand
had
saddles
and
bridles
and
rusty
little
iron
stirrups
into
which
they
thrust
their
naked
toes
but
all
gentry
and
commonalty
alike
rode
equally
well
and
with
the
same
skill
and
fearlessness
to
see
our
hosts
gallop
at
headlong
speed
over
any
kind
of
country
toward
the
sound
of
the
dogs
with
their
quarry
at
bay
or
to
see
them
handle
their
horses
in
a
morass
was
a
pleasure
it
was
equally
a
pleasure
to
see
a
camarada
carrying
his
heavy
spear
leading
a
hound
in
a
leash
and
using
his
machete
to
cut
his
way
through
the
tangled
of
a
jungle
all
at
the
same
time
and
all
without
the
slightest
reference
to
the
plunges
and
the
odd
and
exceedingly
jerky
behavior
of
his
wild
horse
for
on
such
a
ranch
most
of
the
horses
are
apt
to
come
in
the
categories
of
or
else
of
one
dusky
tatterdemalion
wore
a
pair
of
boots
from
which
he
had
removed
the
soles
his
bare
feet
projecting
from
beneath
the
uppers
he
was
on
a
little
devil
of
a
stallion
which
he
rode
blindfold
for
a
couple
of
miles
and
there
was
a
regular
circus
when
he
removed
the
bandage
but
evidently
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
animal
was
hardly
a
comfortable
for
a
man
going
out
hunting
and
encumbered
with
a
spear
a
machete
and
other
belongings
the
eight
hours
that
we
were
out
we
spent
chiefly
in
splashing
across
the
marshes
with
excursions
now
and
then
into
belts
and
clumps
of
timber
some
of
the
bayous
we
had
to
cross
were
uncomfortably
boggy
we
had
to
lead
the
horses
through
one
wading
ahead
of
them
and
even
so
two
of
them
mired
down
and
their
saddles
had
to
be
taken
off
before
they
could
be
gotten
out
among
the
marsh
plants
were
fields
and
strips
of
the
great
caete
rush
these
caete
flags
towered
above
the
other
and
lesser
marsh
plants
they
were
higher
than
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
their
two
or
three
huge
like
leaves
stood
straight
up
on
end
the
large
brilliant
flowers
orange
red
and
yellow
were
joined
into
a
singularly
shaped
and
solid
string
or
cluster
buzzed
round
these
flowers
one
species
the
hummer
has
its
bill
especially
adapted
for
use
in
these
queerly
shaped
blossoms
and
gets
its
food
only
from
them
never
appearing
around
any
other
plant
the
birds
were
tame
even
those
striking
and
beautiful
birds
which
under
man
persecution
are
so
apt
to
become
scarce
and
shy
the
huge
jabiru
storks
stalking
through
the
water
with
stately
dignity
sometimes
refused
to
fly
until
we
were
only
a
hundred
yards
off
one
of
them
flew
over
our
heads
at
a
distance
of
thirty
or
forty
yards
the
screamers
crying
and
the
ibises
wailing
dolefully
came
even
closer
the
wonderful
hyacinth
macaws
in
twos
and
threes
accompanied
us
at
times
for
several
hundred
yards
hovering
over
our
heads
and
uttering
their
rasping
screams
in
one
wood
we
came
on
the
black
howler
monkey
the
place
smelt
almost
like
a
menagerie
not
watching
with
sufficient
care
i
brushed
against
a
sapling
on
which
the
venomous
swarmed
they
burnt
the
skin
like
cinders
and
left
little
sores
more
than
once
in
the
drier
parts
of
the
marsh
we
met
small
caymans
making
their
way
from
one
pool
to
another
my
horse
stepped
over
one
before
i
saw
it
the
dead
carcasses
of
others
showed
that
on
their
wanderings
they
had
encountered
jaguars
or
human
foes
we
had
been
out
about
three
hours
when
one
of
the
dogs
gave
tongue
in
a
large
belt
of
woodland
and
jungle
to
the
left
of
our
line
of
march
through
the
marsh
the
other
dogs
ran
to
the
sound
and
after
a
while
the
long
barking
told
that
the
thing
whatever
it
was
was
at
bay
or
else
in
some
refuge
we
made
our
way
toward
the
place
on
foot
the
dogs
were
baying
excitedly
at
the
mouth
of
a
huge
hollow
log
and
very
short
examination
showed
us
that
there
were
two
peccaries
within
doubtless
a
boar
and
sow
however
just
at
this
moment
the
peccaries
bolted
from
an
unsuspected
opening
at
the
other
end
of
the
log
dove
into
the
tangle
and
instantly
disappeared
with
the
hounds
in
full
cry
after
them
it
was
twenty
minutes
later
before
we
again
heard
the
pack
baying
with
much
difficulty
and
by
the
incessant
swinging
of
the
machetes
we
opened
a
trail
through
the
network
of
vines
and
branches
this
time
there
was
only
one
peccary
the
boar
he
was
at
bay
in
a
stump
the
dogs
were
about
his
head
raving
with
excitement
and
it
was
not
possible
to
use
the
rifle
so
i
borrowed
the
spear
of
dom
joao
the
younger
and
killed
the
fierce
little
boar
therewith
this
was
an
animal
akin
to
our
collared
peccary
smaller
and
less
fierce
than
its
kinsfolk
it
is
a
valiant
and
truculent
little
beast
nevertheless
and
if
given
the
chance
will
bite
a
piece
the
size
of
a
teacup
out
of
either
man
or
dog
it
is
found
singly
or
in
small
parties
feeds
on
roots
fruits
grass
and
delights
to
make
its
home
in
hollow
logs
if
taken
young
it
makes
an
affectionate
and
entertaining
pet
when
the
two
were
in
the
hollow
log
we
heard
them
utter
a
kind
of
moaning
or
menacing
grunt
long
drawn
an
hour
or
two
afterward
we
unexpectedly
struck
the
fresh
tracks
of
two
jaguars
and
at
once
loosed
the
dogs
who
tore
off
yelling
on
the
line
of
the
scent
unfortunately
just
at
this
moment
the
clouds
burst
and
a
deluge
of
rain
drove
in
our
faces
so
heavy
was
the
downpour
that
the
dogs
lost
the
trail
and
we
lost
the
dogs
we
found
them
again
only
owing
to
one
of
our
caboclos
an
indian
with
a
queer
mongolian
face
and
no
brain
at
all
that
i
could
discover
apart
from
his
special
dealings
with
wild
creatures
cattle
and
horses
he
rode
in
a
huddle
of
rags
but
nothing
escaped
his
eyes
and
he
rode
anything
anywhere
the
downpour
continued
so
heavily
that
we
knew
the
rodeo
had
been
abandoned
and
we
turned
our
faces
for
the
long
dripping
splashing
ride
homeward
through
the
gusts
of
driving
rain
we
could
hardly
see
the
way
once
the
rain
lightened
and
half
a
mile
away
the
sunshine
gleamed
through
a
rift
in
the
leaden
suddenly
in
this
rift
of
shimmering
brightness
there
appeared
a
flock
of
beautiful
white
egrets
with
strong
graceful
the
birds
urged
their
flight
their
plumage
flashing
in
the
sun
they
then
crossed
the
rift
and
were
swallowed
in
the
gray
gloom
of
the
day
on
the
marsh
the
dogs
several
times
roused
capybaras
where
there
were
no
ponds
of
sufficient
size
the
capybaras
sought
refuge
in
flight
through
the
tangled
marsh
they
ran
well
kermit
and
fiala
went
after
one
on
foot
for
a
mile
and
a
half
with
two
hounds
which
then
bayed
it
literally
bayed
it
for
the
capybara
fought
with
the
courage
of
a
gigantic
woodchuck
if
the
pack
overtook
a
capybara
they
of
course
speedily
finished
it
but
a
single
dog
of
our
not
very
valorous
outfit
was
not
able
to
overmatch
its
opponent
near
the
about
forty
feet
up
in
a
big
tree
was
a
jabiru
nest
containing
young
jabirus
the
young
birds
exercised
themselves
by
walking
solemnly
round
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
opening
and
shutting
their
wings
their
heads
and
necks
were
instead
of
being
naked
like
those
of
their
parents
fiala
wished
to
take
a
of
them
while
thus
engaged
and
so
after
arranging
his
machine
he
asked
harper
to
rouse
the
young
birds
by
throwing
a
stick
up
to
the
nest
he
did
so
whereupon
one
young
jabiru
hastily
opened
its
wings
in
the
desired
fashion
at
the
same
time
seizing
the
stick
in
its
bill
it
dropped
it
at
once
with
an
air
of
comic
disappointment
when
it
found
that
the
stick
was
not
edible
there
were
many
strange
birds
round
about
toucans
were
not
uncommon
i
have
never
seen
any
other
bird
take
such
grotesque
and
comic
attitudes
as
the
toucan
this
day
i
saw
one
standing
in
the
top
of
a
tree
with
the
big
bill
pointing
straight
into
the
air
and
the
tail
also
cocked
perpendicularly
the
toucan
is
a
born
comedian
on
the
river
and
in
the
ponds
we
saw
the
finfoot
a
bird
with
feet
like
a
grebe
and
bill
and
tail
like
those
of
a
darter
but
like
so
many
south
american
birds
with
no
close
affiliations
among
other
species
the
exceedingly
rich
bird
fauna
of
south
america
contains
many
species
which
seem
to
be
survivals
from
a
very
remote
geologic
past
whose
kinsfolk
have
perished
under
the
changed
conditions
of
recent
ages
and
in
the
case
of
many
like
the
hoatzin
and
screamer
their
like
is
not
known
elsewhere
herons
of
many
species
swarmed
in
this
neighborhood
the
handsomest
was
the
richly
colored
tiger
bittern
two
other
species
were
so
unlike
ordinary
herons
that
i
did
not
recognize
them
as
herons
at
all
until
cherrie
told
me
what
they
were
one
had
a
dark
body
a
or
ocellated
neck
and
a
bill
almost
like
that
of
an
ibis
the
other
looked
white
but
was
really
with
black
on
the
head
when
perched
on
a
tree
it
stood
like
an
ibis
and
instead
of
the
measured
characteristic
of
a
flight
it
flew
with
a
quick
vigorous
flapping
of
the
wings
there
were
queer
mammals
too
as
well
as
birds
in
the
fields
miller
trapped
mice
of
a
kind
entirely
new
next
morning
the
sky
was
leaden
and
a
drenching
rain
fell
as
we
began
our
descent
of
the
river
the
rainy
season
had
fairly
begun
for
our
good
fortune
we
were
still
where
we
had
the
cabins
aboard
the
boat
and
the
in
which
to
dry
our
clothes
and
soggy
shoes
but
in
the
intensely
humid
atmosphere
hot
and
steaming
they
stayed
wet
a
long
time
and
were
still
moist
when
we
put
them
on
again
before
we
left
the
house
where
we
had
been
treated
with
such
courteous
hospitality
the
finest
in
matto
grosso
on
a
huge
ranch
where
there
are
some
sixty
thousand
head
of
horned
cattle

with

magnificent

the
work
of

director
of
the
botanical
gardens
at
rio

the
two
folios
were
in
a
box
of
native
cedar
no
gift
more
appropriate
none
that
i
would
in
the
future
value
more
as
a
reminder
of
my
stay
in
matto
grosso
could
have
been
given
me
all
that
afternoon
the
rain
continued
it
was
still
pouring
in
torrents
when
we
left
the
cuyaba
for
the
sao
lourenco
and
steamed
up
the
latter
a
few
miles
before
anchoring
dom
joao
the
younger
had
accompanied
us
in
his
launch
the
little
river
steamer
was
of
very
open
build
as
is
necessary
in
such
a
hot
climate
and
to
keep
things
dry
necessitated
also
keeping
the
atmosphere
stifling
the
german
taxidermist
who
was
with

reinisch
a
very
good
fellow
from
vienna
sat
on
a
stool
alternately
drenched
with
rain
and
sweltering
with
heat
and
muttered
to
himself
ach
schweinerei
two
small
caymans
of
the
common
species
with
prominent
eyes
were
at
the
bank
where
we
moored
and
betrayed
an
astonishing
and
stupid
tameness
neither
the
size
of
the
boat
nor
the
commotion
caused
by
the
paddles
in
any
way
affected
them
they
lay
inshore
not
twenty
feet
from
us
half
out
of
water
they
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
to
our
presence
and
only
reluctantly
left
when
repeatedly
poked
at
and
after
having
been
repeatedly
hit
with
clods
of
mud
and
sticks
and
even
then
one
first
crawled
up
on
shore
to
find
out
if
thereby
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
annoyance
we
caused
him
next
morning
it
was
still
raining
but
we
set
off
on
a
hunt
anyway
going
afoot
a
couple
of
brown
camaradas
led
the
way
and
colonel
rondon
dom
joao
kermit
and
i
followed
the
incessant
downpour
speedily
wet
us
to
the
skin
we
made
our
way
slowly
through
the
forest
the
machetes
playing
right
and
left
up
and
down
at
every
step
for
the
trees
were
tangled
in
a
network
of
vines
and
creepers
some
of
the
vines
were
as
thick
as
a
man
leg
mosquitoes
hummed
about
us
the
venomous
stung
us
the
sharp
spines
of
a
small
palm
tore
our
hands
afterward
some
of
the
wounds
festered
hour
after
hour
we
thus
walked
on
through
the
brazilian
forest
we
saw
monkeys
the
common
yellowish
kind
a
species
of
cebus
a
couple
were
shot
for
the
museum
and
the
others
raced
off
among
the
upper
branches
of
the
trees
then
we
came
on
a
party
of
coatis
which
look
like
reddish
lanky
raccoons
they
were
in
the
top
of
a
big
tree
one
when
shot
at
and
missed
bounced
down
to
the
ground
and
ran
off
through
the
bushes
kermit
ran
after
it
and
secured
it
he
came
back
to
find
us
peering
hopelessly
up
into
the
tree
top
trying
to
place
where
the
other
coatis
were
kermit
solved
the
difficulty
by
going
up
along
some
huge
twisted
lianas
for
forty
or
fifty
feet
and
exploring
the
upper
branches
whereupon
down
came
three
other
coatis
through
the
branches
one
being
caught
by
the
dogs
and
the
other
two
escaping
coatis
fight
savagely
with
both
teeth
and
claws
miller
told
us
that
he
once
saw
one
of
them
kill
a
dog
they
feed
on
all
small
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
and
even
on
some
large
ones
they
kill
iguanas
cherrie
saw
a
rattling
chase
through
the
trees
a
coati
following
an
iguana
at
full
speed
we
heard
the
rush
of
a
couple
of
tapirs
as
they
broke
away
in
the
jungle
in
front
of
the
dogs
and
headed
according
to
their
custom
for
the
river
but
we
never
saw
them
one
of
the
party
shot
a
bush
deer
a
very
pretty
graceful
creature
smaller
than
our
whitetail
deer
but
kin
to
it
and
doubtless
the
southernmost
representative
of
the
whitetail
group
the
whitetail
deer
using
the
word
to
designate
a
group
of
deer
which
can
neither
be
called
a
subgenus
with
many
species
nor
a
widely
spread
species
diverging
into
many
varieties
is
the
only
north
american
species
which
has
spread
down
into
and
has
outlying
representatives
in
south
america
it
has
been
contended
that
the
species
has
spread
from
south
america
northward
i
do
not
think
so
and
the
specimen
thus
obtained
furnished
a
probable
refutation
of
the
theory
it
was
a
buck
and
had
just
shed
its
small
antlers
the
antlers
are
therefore
shed
at
the
same
time
as
in
the
north
and
it
appears
that
they
are
grown
at
the
same
time
as
in
the
north
yet
this
variety
now
dwells
in
the
tropics
south
of
the
equator
where
the
spring
and
the
breeding
season
for
most
birds
comes
at
the
time
of
the
northern
fall
in
september
october
and
november
that
the
deer
is
an
intrusive
immigrant
and
that
it
has
not
yet
been
in
south
america
long
enough
to
change
its
mating
season
in
accordance
with
the
climate
as
the
birds
geologically
doubtless
very
old
residents
have
changed
their
breeding
season
is
rendered
probable
by
the
fact
that
it
conforms
so
exactly
in
the
time
of
its
antler
growth
to
the
universal
rule
which
obtains
in
the
great
arctogeal
realm
where
deer
of
many
species
abound
and
where
the
fossil
forms
show
that
they
have
long
existed
the
which
has
diverged
much
further
from
the
northern
type
than
this
bush
deer
its
horns
show
a
likeness
to
those
of
a
blacktail
often
keeps
its
antlers
until
june
or
july
although
it
begins
to
grow
them
again
in
august
however
too
much
stress
must
not
be
laid
on
this
fact
inasmuch
as
the
wapiti
and
the
cow
caribou
both
keep
their
antlers
until
spring
the
specialization
of
the
deer
by
the
way
is
further
shown
in
its
hoofs
which
thanks
to
its
mode
of
life
have
grown
long
like
those
of
such
african
swamp
antelopes
as
the
lechwe
and
situtunga
miller
when
we
presented
the
monkeys
to
him
told
us
that
the
females
both
of
these
monkeys
and
of
the
howlers
themselves
took
care
of
the
young
the
males
not
assisting
them
and
moreover
that
when
the
young
one
was
a
male
he
had
always
found
the
mother
keeping
by
herself
away
from
the
old
males
on
the
other
hand
among
the
marmosets
he
found
the
fathers
taking
as
much
care
of
the
young
as
the
mothers
if
the
mother
had
twins
the
father
would
usually
carry
one
and
sometimes
both
around
with
him
after
we
had
been
out
four
hours
our
camaradas
got
lost
three
several
times
they
travelled
round
in
a
complete
circle
and
we
had
to
set
them
right
with
the
compass
about
noon
the
rain
which
had
been
falling
almost
without
interruption
for
hours
let
up
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
sun
came
out
we
went
back
to
the
river
and
found
our
rowboat
in
it
the
hounds
a
motley
and
rather
worthless
lot
and
the
rest
of
the
party
were
ferried
across
to
the
opposite
bank
while
colonel
rondon
and
i
stayed
in
the
boat
on
the
chance
that
a
tapir
might
be
roused
and
take
to
the
river
however
no
tapir
was
found
kermit
killed
a
collared
peccary
and
i
shot
a
capybara
representing
a
the
naturalists
wished
next
morning
january
we
were
up
at
five
and
had
a
good
new
year
day
breakfast
of
hardtack
ham
sardines
and
coffee
before
setting
out
on
an
all
day
hunt
on
foot
i
much
feared
that
the
pack
was
almost
or
quite
worthless
for
jaguars
but
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
great
spotted
cats
in
the
neighborhood
and
it
seemed
worth
while
to
make
a
try
for
them
anyhow
after
an
hour
or
two
we
found
the
fresh
tracks
of
two
and
after
them
we
went
our
party
consisted
of
colonel
rondon
lieutenant
rogaciano
an
excellent
man
himself
a
native
of
matto
grosso
of
old
matto
grosso
stock
two
others
of
the
party
from
the
sao
joao
ranch
kermit
and
myself
together
with
four
camaradas
cowhands
from
the
same
ranch
we
soon
found
that
the
dogs
would
not
by
themselves
follow
the
jaguar
trail
nor
would
the
camaradas
although
they
carried
spears
kermit
was
the
one
of
our
party
who
possessed
the
requisite
speed
endurance
and
eyesight
and
accordingly
he
led
two
of
the
dogs
would
follow
the
track
half
a
dozen
yards
ahead
of
him
but
no
farther
and
two
of
the
camaradas
could
just
about
keep
up
with
him
for
an
hour
we
went
through
thick
jungle
where
the
machetes
were
constantly
at
work
then
the
trail
struck
off
straight
across
the
marshes
for
jaguars
swim
and
wade
as
freely
as
it
was
a
hard
walk
the
sun
was
out
we
were
drenched
with
sweat
we
were
torn
by
the
spines
of
the
innumerable
clusters
of
small
palms
with
thorns
like
needles
we
were
bitten
by
the
hosts
of
and
by
the
mosquitoes
which
we
scarcely
noticed
where
the
were
found
exactly
as
all
dread
of
the
latter
vanished
when
we
were
menaced
by
the
big
red
wasps
of
which
a
dozen
stings
will
disable
a
man
and
if
he
is
weak
or
in
bad
health
will
seriously
menace
his
life
in
the
marsh
we
were
continually
wading
now
up
to
our
knees
now
up
to
our
hips
twice
we
came
to
long
bayous
so
deep
that
we
had
to
swim
them
holding
our
rifles
above
water
in
our
right
hands
the
floating
masses
of
marsh
grass
and
the
slimy
stems
of
the
doubled
our
work
as
we
swam
cumbered
by
our
clothing
and
boots
and
holding
our
rifles
aloft
one
result
of
the
swim
by
the
way
was
that
my
watch
a
veteran
of
cuba
and
africa
came
to
an
indignant
halt
then
on
we
went
hampered
by
the
weight
of
our
drenched
clothes
while
our
soggy
boots
squelched
as
we
walked
there
was
no
breeze
in
the
undimmed
sky
the
sun
stood
almost
overhead
the
heat
beat
on
us
in
waves
by
noon
i
could
only
go
forward
at
a
slow
walk
and
two
of
the
party
were
worse
off
than
i
was
kermit
with
the
dogs
and
two
camaradas
close
behind
him
disappeared
across
the
marshes
at
a
trot
at
last
when
he
was
out
of
sight
and
it
was
obviously
useless
to
follow
him
the
rest
of
us
turned
back
toward
the
boat
the
two
exhausted
members
of
the
party
gave
out
and
we
left
them
under
a
tree
colonel
rondon
and
lieutenant
rogaciano
were
not
much
tired
i
was
somewhat
tired
but
was
perfectly
able
to
go
for
several
hours
more
if
i
did
not
try
to
go
too
fast
and
we
three
walked
on
to
the
river
reaching
it
about
half
past
four
after
eleven
hours
stiff
walking
with
nothing
to
eat
we
were
soon
on
the
boat
a
relief
party
went
back
for
the
two
men
under
the
tree
and
soon
after
it
reached
them
kermit
also
turned
up
with
his
hounds
and
his
camaradas
trailing
wearily
behind
him
he
had
followed
the
jaguar
trail
until
the
dogs
were
so
tired
that
even
after
he
had
bathed
them
and
then
held
their
noses
in
the
fresh
footprints
they
would
pay
no
heed
to
the
scent
a
hunter
of
scientific
tastes
a
or
even
an
outdoors
naturalist
or
faunal
naturalist
interested
in
big
mammals
with
a
pack
of
hounds
such
as
those
with
which
paul
rainey
hunted
lion
and
leopard
in
africa
or
such
a
pack
as
the
packs
of
johnny
goff
and
jake
borah
with
which
i
hunted
cougar
lynx
and
bear
in
the
rockies
or
such
packs
as
those
of
the
mississippi
and
louisiana
planters
with
whom
i
have
hunted
bear
and
deer
in
the
of
the
lower
mississippi
would
not
only
enjoy
fine
hunting
in
these
vast
marshes
of
the
upper
paraguay
but
would
also
do
work
of
real
scientific
value
as
regards
all
the
big
cats
only
a
limited
number
of
the
naturalists
who
have
worked
in
the
tropics
have
had
any
experience
with
the
big
beasts
whose
histories
possess
such
peculiar
interest
of
all
the
biologists
who
have
seriously
studied
the
south
american
fauna
on
the
ground
bates
probably
rendered
most
service
but
he
hardly
seems
even
to
have
seen
the
animals
with
which
the
hunter
is
fairly
familiar
his
interests
and
those
of
the
other
biologists
of
his
kind
lay
in
other
directions
in
consequence
in
treating
of
the
of
the
very
interesting
big
game
we
have
been
largely
forced
to
rely
either
on
native
report
in
which
acutely
accurate
observation
is
invariably
mixed
with
wild
fable
or
else
on
the
chance
remarks
of
travellers
or
mere
sportsmen
who
had
not
the
training
to
make
them
understand
even
what
it
was
desirable
to
observe
nowadays
there
is
a
growing
proportion
of
hunters
of
sportsmen
who
are
of
the
schilling
selous
and
shiras
type
these
men
do
work
of
capital
value
for
science
the
mere
butcher
is
tending
to
disappear
as
a
type
on
the
other
hand
the
hunter
who
is
a
good
observer
a
good
field
naturalist
occupies
at
present
a
more
important
position
than
ever
before
and
it
is
now
recognized
that
he
can
do
work
which
the
closest
naturalist
can
not
do
the
hunter
of
this
type
and
the
outdoors
faunal
naturalist
the
student
of
the
of
big
mammals
have
open
to
them
in
south
america
a
wonderful
field
in
which
to
work
the
of
which
i
have
above
spoken
are
generally
found
on
a
species
of
small
tree
or
sapling
with
a
greenish
trunk
they
bend
the
whole
body
as
they
bite
the
tail
and
head
being
thrust
downward
a
few
seconds
after
the
bite
the
poison
causes
considerable
pain
later
it
may
make
a
tiny
festering
sore
there
is
certainly
the
most
extraordinary
diversity
in
the
traits
by
which
nature
achieves
the
perpetuation
of
species
among
the
warrior
and
predaceous
insects
the
prowess
is
in
some
cases
of
such
type
as
to
render
the
possessor
practically
immune
from
danger
in
other
cases
the
condition
of
its
exercise
may
normally
be
the
sacrifice
of
the
life
of
the
possessor
there
are
wasps
that
prey
on
formidable
fighting
spiders
which
yet
instinctively
so
handle
themselves
that
the
prey
practically
never
succeeds
in
either
defending
itself
or
retaliating
being
captured
and
paralyzed
with
unerring
efficiency
and
with
entire
security
to
the
wasp
the
wasp
safety
is
absolute
on
the
other
hand
these
fighting
ants
including
the
soldiers
even
among
the
termites
are
frantically
eager
for
a
success
which
generally
means
their
annihilation
the
condition
of
their
efficiency
is
absolute
indifference
to
their
own
security
probably
the
majority
of
the
ants
that
actually
lay
hold
on
a
foe
suffer
death
in
consequence
certainly
they
not
merely
run
the
risk
of
but
eagerly
invite
death
the
following
day
we
descended
the
sao
lourenco
to
its
junction
with
the
paraguay
and
once
more
began
the
ascent
of
the
latter
at
one
where
we
stopped
the
troupials
or
big
black
and
yellow
orioles
had
built
a
large
colony
of
their
nests
on
a
dead
tree
near
the
primitive
little
the
birds
were
breeding
the
old
ones
were
feeding
the
young
in
this
neighborhood
the
naturalists
found
many
birds
that
were
new
to
them
including
a
tiny
woodpecker
no
bigger
than
a
kinglet
they
had
collected
two
night
monkeys
nocturnal
monkeys
not
as
agile
as
the
ordinary
monkey
these
two
were
found
at
dawn
having
stayed
out
too
late
the
early
morning
was
always
lovely
on
these
rivers
and
at
that
hour
many
birds
and
beasts
were
to
be
seen
one
morning
we
saw
a
fine
marsh
buck
holding
his
head
aloft
as
he
stared
at
us
his
red
coat
vivid
against
the
green
marsh
another
of
these
swam
the
river
ahead
of
us
i
shot
at
it
as
it
landed
and
ought
to
have
got
it
but
did
not
as
always
with
these
and
as
with
so
many
other
deer
i
was
struck
by
the
revealing
or
advertising
quality
of
its
red
coloration
there
was
nothing
in
its
normal
surroundings
with
which
this
coloration
harmonized
so
far
as
it
had
any
effect
whatever
it
was
always
a
revealing
and
not
a
concealing
effect
when
the
animal
fled
the
black
of
the
erect
tail
was
an
additional
revealing
mark
although
not
of
such
startlingly
advertising
quality
as
the
flag
of
the
whitetail
the
whitetail
in
one
of
its
forms
and
with
the
ordinary
whitetail
custom
of
displaying
the
white
flag
as
it
runs
is
found
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
it
has
the
same
foes
evidently
it
is
of
no
survival
consequence
whether
the
running
deer
displays
a
white
or
a
black
flag
any
competent
observer
of
big
game
must
be
struck
by
the
fact
that
in
the
great
majority
of
the
species
the
coloration
is
not
concealing
and
that
in
many
it
has
a
highly
revealing
quality
moreover
if
the
spotted
or
striped
young
represent
the
ancestral
coloration
and
if
as
seems
probable
the
spots
and
stripes
have
on
the
whole
some
slight
concealing
value
it
is
evident
that
in
the
life
history
of
most
of
these
large
mammals
both
among
those
that
prey
and
those
that
are
preyed
on
concealing
coloration
has
not
been
a
survival
factor
throughout
the
ages
during
which
they
have
survived
they
have
gradually
lost
whatever
of
concealing
coloration
they
may
once
have
had
if
any
and
have
developed
a
coloration
which
under
present
conditions
has
no
concealing
and
perhaps
even
has
a
revealing
quality
and
which
in
all
probability
never
would
have
had
a
concealing
value
in
any
environmental
complex
in
which
the
species
as
a
whole
lived
during
its
ancestral
development
indeed
it
seems
astonishing
when
one
observes
these
big
beasts
and
big
waders
and
other
in
their
native
surroundings
to
find
how
utterly
their
often
strikingly
revealing
coloration
is
evidently
the
various
other
survival
factors
such
as
habit
and
in
many
cases
cover
are
of
such
overmastering
importance
that
the
coloration
is
generally
of
no
consequence
whatever
one
way
or
the
other
and
is
only
very
rarely
a
factor
of
any
serious
weight
the
junction
of
the
sao
lourenco
and
the
paraguay
is
a
day
journey
above
corumba
from
corumba
there
is
a
regular
service
by
shallow
steamers
to
cuyaba
at
the
head
of
one
fork
and
to
sao
luis
de
caceres
at
the
head
of
the
other
the
steamers
are
not
powerful
and
the
voyage
to
each
little
city
takes
a
week
there
are
other
forks
that
are
navigable
above
cuyaba
and
caceres
launches
go
for
several
days
journey
except
during
the
dryest
parts
of
the
season
north
of
this
marshy
plain
lies
the
highland
the
plan
alto
where
the
nights
are
cool
and
the
climate
healthy
but
i
wish
emphatically
to
record
my
view
that
these
marshy
plains
although
hot
are
also
healthy
and
moreover
the
mosquitoes
in
most
places
are
not
in
sufficient
numbers
to
be
a
serious
pest
although
of
course
there
must
be
nets
for
protection
against
them
at
night
the
country
is
excellently
suited
for
settlement
and
offers
a
remarkable
field
for
moreover
it
is
a
paradise
for
and
for
many
other
kinds
of
birds
and
for
many
mammals
it
is
literally
an
ideal
place
in
which
a
field
naturalist
could
spend
six
months
or
a
year
it
is
readily
accessible
it
offers
an
almost
virgin
field
for
work
and
the
life
would
be
healthy
as
well
as
delightfully
attractive
the
man
should
have
a
in
it
he
could
with
comfort
cover
all
parts
of
the
country
from
south
of
corumbra
to
north
of
cuyaba
and
caceres
there
would
have
to
be
a
good
deal
of
collecting
although
nothing
in
the
nature
of
butchery
should
be
tolerated
for
the
region
has
only
been
superficially
worked
especially
as
regards
mammals
but
if
the
man
were
only
a
collector
he
would
leave
undone
the
part
of
the
work
best
worth
doing
the
region
offers
extraordinary
opportunities
for
the
study
of
the
of
birds
which
because
of
their
size
their
beauty
or
their
habits
are
of
exceptional
interest
all
kinds
of
problems
would
be
worked
out
for
example
on
the
morning
of
the
as
we
were
ascending
the
paraguay
we
again
and
again
saw
in
the
trees
on
the
bank
big
nests
of
sticks
into
and
out
of
which
parakeets
were
flying
by
the
dozen
some
of
them
had
straws
or
twigs
in
their
bills
in
some
of
the
big
globular
nests
we
could
make
out
several
holes
of
exit
or
entrance
apparently
these
parakeets
were
building
or
remodelling
communal
nests
but
whether
they
had
themselves
built
these
nests
or
had
taken
old
nests
and
added
to
or
modified
them
we
could
not
tell
there
was
so
much
of
interest
all
along
the
banks
that
we
were
continually
longing
to
stop
and
spend
days
where
we
were
mixed
flocks
of
scores
of
cormorants
and
darters
covered
certain
trees
both
at
sunset
and
after
sunrise
although
there
was
no
deep
forest
merely
belts
or
fringes
of
trees
along
the
river
or
in
patches
back
of
it
we
frequently
saw
monkeys
in
this
riverine
active
common
monkeys
and
black
howlers
of
more
leisurely
gait
we
saw
caymans
and
capybaras
sitting
socially
near
one
another
on
the
sandbanks
at
night
we
heard
the
calling
of
large
flights
of
these
were
now
the
most
common
of
all
the
ducks
although
there
were
many
muscovy
ducks
also
the
evenings
were
pleasant
and
not
hot
as
we
sat
on
the
forward
deck
there
was
a
waxing
moon
the
screamers
were
among
the
most
noticeable
birds
they
were
noisy
they
perched
on
the
very
tops
of
the
trees
not
down
among
the
branches
and
they
were
not
shy
they
should
be
carefully
protected
by
law
for
they
readily
become
tame
and
then
come
familiarly
round
the
houses
from
the
steamer
we
now
and
then
saw
beautiful
orchids
in
the
trees
on
the
river
bank
one
afternoon
we
stopped
at
the
home
buildings
or
headquarters
of
one
of
the
great
outlying
ranches
of
the
brazil
land
and
cattle
company
the
farquahar
syndicate
under
the
management
of
murdo
mackenzie
than
whom
we
have
in
the
united
states
no
better
citizen
or
more
competent
cattleman
on
this
ranch
there
are
some
seventy
thousand
head
of
stock
we
were
warmly
greeted
by
mclean
the
head
of
the
ranch
and
his
assistant
ramsey
an
old
texan
friend
among
the
other
assistants
all
equally
cordial
were
several
belgians
and
frenchmen
the
hands
were
paraguayans
and
brazilians
and
a
few
indians
a
set
each
of
whom
always
goes
armed
and
knows
how
to
use
his
arms
for
there
are
constant
collisions
with
cattle
thieves
from
across
the
bolivian
border
and
the
ranch
has
to
protect
itself
these
cowhands
vaqueiros
were
of
the
type
with
which
we
were
now
familiar
skinned
lean
men
in
worn
shirts
and
trousers
and
fringed
leather
aprons
with
heavy
spurs
on
their
bare
feet
they
are
wonderful
riders
and
ropers
and
fear
neither
man
nor
beast
i
noticed
one
indian
vaqueiro
standing
in
exactly
the
attitude
of
a
shilluk
of
the
white
nile
with
the
sole
of
one
foot
against
the
other
leg
above
the
knee
this
is
a
region
with
extraordinary
possibilities
of
at
this
ranch
there
was
a
tannery
a
a
cannery
a
church
buildings
of
various
kinds
and
all
degrees
of
comfort
for
the
thirty
or
forty
families
who
made
the
place
their
headquarters
and
the
handsome
white
big
house
standing
among
and
flamboyants
on
the
there
were
all
kinds
of
pets
around
the
house
the
most
fascinating
was
a
wee
spotted
fawn
which
loved
being
petted
half
a
dozen
curassows
of
different
species
strolled
through
the
rooms
there
were
also
parrots
of
several
different
species
and
immediately
outside
the
house
four
or
five
herons
with
unclipped
wings
which
would
let
us
come
within
a
few
feet
and
then
fly
gracefully
off
shortly
afterward
returning
to
the
same
spot
they
included
big
and
little
white
egrets
and
also
the
mauve
and
heron
with
a
partially
black
head
and
colored
bill
which
flies
with
quick
repeated
instead
of
the
usual
slow
heron
in
the
warehouse
were
scores
of
skins
of
jaguar
puma
ocelot
and
jaguarundi
and
one
skin
of
the
big
red
wolf
these
were
all
brought
in
by
the
cowhands
and
by
friendly
indians
a
price
being
put
on
each
as
they
destroyed
the
stock
the
jaguars
occasionally
killed
horses
and
cows
but
not
bulls
the
pumas
killed
the
calves
the
others
killed
an
occasional
very
young
calf
but
ordinarily
only
sheep
little
pigs
and
chickens
there
was
one
black
melanism
is
much
more
common
among
jaguars
than
pumas
although
once
miller
saw
a
black
puma
that
had
been
killed
by
indians
the
patterns
of
the
and
even
more
of
the
showed
wide
variation
no
two
being
alike
the
pumas
were
for
the
most
part
bright
red
but
some
were
reddish
gray
there
being
much
the
same
dichromatism
that
i
found
among
their
colorado
kinsfolk
the
jaguarundis
were
dark
brownish
gray
all
these
animals
the
spotted
jaguars
and
ocelots
the
monochrome
black
jaguars
red
pumas
and
jaguarundis
were
killed
in
the
same
locality
with
the
same
environment
a
glance
at
the
skins
and
a
serious
thought
would
have
been
enough
to
show
any
sincere
thinker
that
in
these
cats
the
coloration
pattern
whether
concealing
or
revealing
is
of
no
consequence
one
way
or
the
other
as
a
survival
factor
the
spotted
patterns
conferred
no
benefit
as
compared
with
the
nearly
or
quite
monochrome
blacks
reds
and
dark
grays
the
bodily
condition
of
the
various
beasts
was
equally
good
showing
that
their
success
in
life
that
is
their
ability
to
catch
their
prey
was
unaffected
by
their
several
color
schemes
except
white
there
is
no
color
so
conspicuously
advertising
as
black
yet
the
black
jaguar
had
been
a
fine
powerful
beast
the
spotted
patterns
in
the
forests
and
perhaps
even
in
the
marshes
which
the
jaguars
so
frequently
traversed
are
probably
a
shade
less
conspicuous
than
the
monochrome
red
and
gray
but
the
puma
and
jaguarundi
are
just
as
hard
to
see
and
evidently
find
it
just
as
easy
to
catch
prey
as
the
jaguar
and
ocelot
the
little
fawn
which
we
saw
was
spotted
the
grown
deer
had
lost
the
spots
if
the
spots
do
really
help
to
conceal
the
wearer
it
is
evident
that
the
deer
has
found
the
original
concealing
coloration
of
so
little
value
that
it
has
actually
been
lost
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
the
species
when
these
big
cats
and
the
deer
are
considered
together
with
the
dogs
tapirs
peccaries
capybaras
and
big
which
live
in
the
same
environment
and
when
we
also
consider
the
difference
between
the
young
and
the
adult
deer
and
tapirs
both
of
which
when
adult
have
substituted
a
complete
or
partial
monochrome
for
the
ancestral
spots
and
streaks
it
is
evident
that
in
the
present
life
and
in
the
ancestral
development
of
the
big
mammals
of
south
america
coloration
is
not
and
has
not
been
a
survival
factor
any
pattern
and
any
color
may
accompany
the
persistence
and
development
of
the
qualities
and
attributes
which
are
survival
factors
indeed
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
in
their
ordinary
environments
such
color
schemes
as
the
bright
red
of
the
the
black
of
the
black
jaguar
and
the
black
with
white
stripes
of
the
great
tamandua
are
not
positive
detriments
to
the
wearers
yet
such
is
evidently
not
the
case
evidently
the
other
factors
in
survival
are
of
such
overwhelming
importance
that
the
coloration
becomes
negligible
from
this
standpoint
whether
it
be
concealing
or
revealing
the
cats
mould
themselves
to
the
ground
as
they
crouch
or
crawl
they
take
advantage
of
the
tiniest
scrap
of
cover
they
move
with
extraordinary
stealth
and
patience
the
other
animals
which
try
to
sneak
off
in
such
manner
as
to
escape
observation
approach
more
or
less
closely
to
the
ideal
which
the
cats
most
nearly
realize
wariness
sharp
senses
the
habit
of
being
rigidly
motionless
when
there
is
the
least
suspicion
of
danger
and
ability
to
take
advantage
of
cover
all
count
on
the
bare
open
treeless
plain
whether
marsh
meadow
or
upland
anything
above
the
level
of
the
grass
is
seen
at
once
a
out
in
the
open
makes
no
effort
to
avoid
observation
its
concern
is
purely
to
see
its
foes
in
time
to
leave
a
dangerous
neighborhood
the
deer
of
the
neighboring
forest
skulk
and
hide
and
lie
still
in
dense
cover
to
avoid
being
seen
the
lipped
peccaries
make
no
effort
to
escape
observation
by
being
either
noiseless
or
motionless
they
trust
for
defence
to
their
gregariousness
and
truculence
the
collared
peccary
also
trusts
to
its
truculence
but
seeks
refuge
in
a
hole
where
it
can
face
any
opponent
with
its
formidable
biting
apparatus
as
for
the
giant
tamandua
in
spite
of
its
fighting
prowess
i
am
wholly
unable
to
understand
how
such
a
slow
and
clumsy
beast
has
been
able
through
the
ages
to
exist
and
thrive
surrounded
by
jaguars
and
pumas
speaking
generally
the
animals
that
seek
to
escape
observation
trust
primarily
to
smell
to
discover
their
foes
or
their
prey
and
see
whatever
moves
and
do
not
see
whatever
is
motionless
by
the
morning
of
january
we
had
left
the
marsh
region
there
were
low
hills
here
and
there
and
the
land
was
covered
with
dense
forest
from
time
to
time
we
passed
little
clearings
with
houses
we
were
approaching
caceres
where
the
easiest
part
of
our
trip
would
end
we
had
lived
in
much
comfort
on
the
little
steamer
the
food
was
plentiful
and
the
cooking
good
at
night
we
slept
on
deck
in
cots
or
hammocks
the
mosquitoes
were
rarely
troublesome
although
in
the
daytime
we
were
sometimes
bothered
by
numbers
of
biting
flies
the
bird
life
was
wonderful
one
of
the
characteristic
sights
we
were
always
seeing
was
that
of
a
number
of
heads
and
necks
of
cormorants
and
without
any
bodies
projecting
above
water
and
disappearing
as
the
steamer
approached
skimmers
and
billed
tern
were
plentiful
here
right
in
the
heart
of
the
continent
in
addition
to
the
spurred
lapwing
characteristic
and
most
interesting
resident
of
most
of
south
america
we
found
tiny
legged
plover
which
also
breed
and
are
at
home
in
the
tropics
the
contrasts
in
habits
between
closely
allied
species
are
wonderful
among
the
plovers
and
bay
snipe
there
are
species
that
live
all
the
year
round
in
almost
the
same
places
in
tropical
and
subtropical
lands
and
other
related
forms
which
wander
over
the
whole
earth
and
spend
nearly
all
their
time
now
in
the
arctic
and
cold
temperate
regions
of
the
far
north
now
in
the
cold
temperate
regions
of
the
south
these
latter
birds
of
the
seashore
and
the
river
bank
pass
most
of
their
lives
in
regions
of
almost
perpetual
sunlight
they
spend
the
breeding
season
the
northern
summer
in
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
during
the
long
arctic
day
they
then
fly
for
endless
distances
down
across
the
north
temperate
zone
across
the
equator
through
the
lands
where
the
days
and
nights
are
always
of
equal
length
into
another
hemisphere
and
spend
another
summer
of
long
days
and
long
twilights
in
the
far
south
where
the
antarctic
winds
cool
them
while
their
nesting
home
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
is
shrouded
beneath
the
iron
desolation
of
the
polar
night
in
the
late
afternoon
of
the
we
reached
the
quaint
little
town
of
sao
luis
de
caceres
on
the
outermost
fringe
of
the
settled
region
of
the
state
of
matto
grosso
the
last
town
we
should
see
before
reaching
the
villages
of
the
amazon
as
we
approached
we
passed
black
washerwomen
on
the
river
edge
the
men
with
the
local
band
were
gathered
at
the
steeply
sloping
foot
of
the
main
street
where
the
steamer
came
to
her
moorings
groups
of
women
and
girls
white
and
brown
watched
us
from
the
low
bluff
their
skirts
and
bodices
were
red
blue
green
of
all
colors
sigg
had
gone
ahead
with
much
of
the
baggage
he
met
us
in
an
improvised
consisting
of
a
dugout
to
the
side
of
which
he
had
clamped
our
evinrude
motor
he
was
giving
several
of
the
local
citizens
of
prominence
a
ride
to
their
huge
enjoyment
the
streets
of
the
little
town
were
unpaved
with
narrow
brick
sidewalks
the
houses
were
white
or
blue
with
roofs
of
red
tiles
and
of
latticed
woodwork
come
down
from
colonial
days
and
tracing
back
through
christian
and
moorish
portugal
to
a
remote
arab
ancestry
pretty
faces
some
dark
some
light
looked
out
from
these
windows
their
mothers
mothers
for
generations
past
must
thus
have
looked
out
of
similar
windows
in
the
vanished
colonial
days
but
now
even
here
in
caceres
the
spirit
of
the
new
brazil
is
moving
a
fine
new
government
school
has
been
started
and
we
met
its
principal
an
earnest
man
doing
excellent
work
one
of
the
many
teachers
who
during
the
last
few
years
have
been
brought
to
matto
grosso
from
sao
paulo
a
centre
of
the
new
educational
movement
which
will
do
so
much
for
brazil
father
zahm
went
to
spend
the
night
with
some
french
franciscan
friars
capital
fellows
i
spent
the
night
at
the
comfortable
house
of
lieutenant
lyra
a
house
with
thick
walls
big
doors
and
an
open
patio
bordered
by
a
gallery
lieutenant
lyra
was
to
accompany
us
he
was
an
old
companion
of
colonel
rondon
explorations
we
visited
one
or
two
of
the
stores
to
make
some
final
purchases
and
in
the
evening
strolled
through
the
dusky
streets
and
under
the
trees
of
the
plaza
the
women
and
girls
sat
in
groups
in
the
doorways
or
at
the
windows
and
here
and
there
a
stringed
instrument
tinkled
in
the
darkness
from
caceres
onward
we
were
entering
the
scene
of
colonel
explorations
for
some
eighteen
years
he
was
occupied
in
exploring
and
in
opening
telegraph
lines
through
the
eastern
or
north
middle
part
of
the
great
forest
state
the
wilderness
state
of
the
matto
grosso
the
great
wilderness
or
as
australians
would
call
it
the
bush
then
in
he
began
to
penetrate
the
unknown
region
lying
to
the
north
and
west
he
was
the
head
of
the
exploring
expeditions
sent
out
by
the
brazilian
government
to
traverse
for
the
first
time
this
unknown
land
to
map
for
the
first
time
the
courses
of
the
rivers
which
from
the
same
divide
run
into
the
upper
portions
of
the
tapajos
and
the
madeira
two
of
the
mighty
affluents
of
the
amazon
and
to
build
across
to
the
madeira
where
a
line
of
brazilian
settlements
connected
by
steamboat
lines
and
a
railroad
again
occurs
three
times
he
penetrated
into
this
absolutely
unknown
wilderness
being
absent
for
a
year
or
two
at
a
time
and
suffering
every
imaginable
hardship
before
he
made
his
way
through
to
the
madeira
and
completed
the
across
the
officers
and
men
of
the
brazilian
army
and
the
civilian
scientists
who
followed
him
shared
the
toil
and
the
credit
of
the
task
some
of
his
men
died
of
beriberi
some
were
killed
or
wounded
by
the
indians
he
himself
almost
died
of
fever
again
and
again
his
whole
party
was
reduced
almost
to
the
last
extremity
by
starvation
disease
hardship
and
the
due
to
wearing
fatigues
in
dealing
with
the
wild
naked
savages
he
showed
a
combination
of
fearlessness
wariness
good
judgment
and
resolute
patience
and
kindliness
the
result
was
that
they
ultimately
became
his
firm
friends
guarded
the
lines
and
helped
the
few
soldiers
left
at
the
isolated
widely
separated
little
posts
he
and
his
assistants
explored
and
mapped
for
the
first
time
the
juruena
and
the
two
important
affluents
of
the
tapajos
and
the
madeira
respectively
the
tapajos
and
the
madeira
like
the
orinoco
and
rio
negro
have
been
highways
of
travel
for
a
couple
of
centuries
the
madeira
as
later
the
tapajos
was
the
chief
means
of
ingress
a
century
and
a
half
ago
to
the
little
portuguese
settlements
of
this
far
interior
region
of
brazil
one
of
these
little
towns
named
matto
grosso
being
the
original
capital
of
the
province
it
has
long
been
abandoned
by
the
government
and
practically
so
by
its
inhabitants
the
ruins
of
palace
fortress
and
church
now
rising
amid
the
rank
tropical
luxuriance
of
the
wild
forest
the
mouths
of
the
main
affluents
of
these
highway
rivers
were
as
a
rule
well
known
but
in
many
cases
nothing
but
the
mouth
was
known
the
river
itself
was
not
known
and
it
was
placed
on
the
map
by
guesswork
colonel
rondon
found
for
example
that
the
course
of
the
was
put
down
on
the
map
two
degrees
out
of
its
proper
place
he
with
his
party
was
the
first
to
find
out
its
sources
the
first
to
traverse
its
upper
course
the
first
to
map
its
length
he
and
his
assistants
performed
a
similar
service
for
the
juruena
discovering
the
sources
discovering
and
descending
some
of
the
branches
and
for
the
first
time
making
a
trustworthy
map
of
the
main
river
itself
until
its
junction
with
the
tapajos
near
the
watershed
between
the
juruena
and
the
he
established
his
farthest
station
to
the
westward
named
jose
bonofacio
after
one
of
the
chief
republican
patriots
of
brazil
a
couple
of
days
march
northwestward
from
this
station
he
in
came
across
a
part
of
the
stream
of
a
river
running
northward
between
the
and
the
juruena
he
could
only
guess
where
it
debouched
believing
it
to
be
into
the
madeira
although
it
was
possible
that
it
entered
the
or
tapajos
the
region
through
which
it
flows
was
unknown
no
civilized
man
having
ever
penetrated
it
and
as
all
conjecture
as
to
what
the
river
was
as
to
its
length
and
as
to
its
place
of
entering
into
some
highway
river
was
mere
he
had
entered
it
on
his
sketch
maps
as
the
rio
da
duvida
the
river
of
doubt
among
the
officers
of
the
brazilian
army
and
the
scientific
civilians
who
have
accompanied
him
there
have
been
not
only
expert
cartographers
photographers
and
telegraphists
but
astronomers
geologists
botanists
and
zoologists
their
reports
published
in
excellent
shape
by
the
brazilian
government
make
an
invaluable
series
of
volumes
reflecting
the
highest
credit
on
the
explorers
and
on
the
government
itself
colonel
rondon
own
accounts
of
his
explorations
of
the
indian
tribes
he
has
visited
and
of
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
he
has
seen
possess
a
peculiar
interest
up
the
river
of
tapirs
after
leaving
caceres
we
went
up
the
sepotuba
which
in
the
local
indian
dialect
means
river
of
tapirs
this
river
is
only
navigable
for
boats
of
size
when
the
water
is
high
it
is
a
swift
fairly
clear
stream
rushing
down
from
the
plan
alto
the
high
uplands
through
the
tropical
lowland
forest
on
the
right
hand
or
western
bank
and
here
and
there
on
the
left
bank
the
forest
is
broken
by
natural
pastures
and
meadows
and
at
one
of
these
places
known
as
porto
campo
sixty
or
seventy
miles
above
the
mouth
there
is
a
here
we
halted
because
the
launch
and
the
two
pranchas
native
with
houses
on
their
decks
which
it
towed
could
not
carry
our
entire
party
and
outfit
accordingly
most
of
the
baggage
and
some
of
the
party
were
sent
ahead
to
where
we
were
to
meet
our
train
at
tapirapoan
meanwhile
the
rest
of
us
made
our
first
camp
under
tents
at
porto
campo
to
wait
the
return
of
the
boats
the
tents
were
placed
in
a
line
with
the
tent
of
colonel
rondon
and
the
tent
in
which
kermit
and
i
slept
in
the
middle
beside
one
another
in
front
of
these
two
on
tall
poles
stood
the
brazilian
and
american
flags
and
at
sunrise
and
sunset
the
flags
were
hoisted
and
hauled
down
while
the
trumpet
sounded
and
all
of
us
stood
at
attention
camp
was
pitched
beside
the
ranch
buildings
in
the
trees
near
the
tents
grew
wonderful
violet
orchids
many
birds
were
around
us
i
saw
some
of
them
and
cherrie
and
miller
many
many
more
they
ranged
from
macaws
green
parrots
and
big
gregarious
cuckoos
down
to
a
brilliant
kingfisher
five
and
a
quarter
inches
long
and
a
tiny
green
manakin
smaller
than
any
bird
i
have
ever
seen
except
a
hummer
we
also
saw
a
bird
that
really
was
protectively
colored
a
kind
of
whippoorwill
which
even
the
naturalists
could
only
make
out
because
it
moved
its
head
we
saw
squirrels
with
showy
orange
tails
lizards
were
common
we
killed
our
first
poisonous
snake
the
second
we
had
seen
an
evil
jararaca
that
was
swimming
the
river
we
also
saw
a
harmless
snake
nearly
eight
feet
long
which
we
were
told
was
akin
to
the
mussurama
and
various
other
snakes
one
day
while
paddling
in
a
canoe
on
the
river
hoping
that
the
dogs
might
drive
a
tapir
to
us
they
drove
into
the
water
a
couple
of
small
bush
deer
instead
there
was
no
point
in
shooting
them
we
caught
them
with
ropes
thrown
over
their
heads
for
the
naturalists
needed
them
as
specimens
and
all
of
us
needed
the
meat
one
of
the
men
was
stung
by
a
single
big
red
maribundi
wasp
for
hours
he
was
in
great
pain
and
incapacitated
for
work
in
a
lagoon
two
of
the
dogs
had
the
tips
of
their
tails
bitten
off
by
piranhas
as
they
swam
and
the
ranch
hands
told
us
that
in
this
lagoon
one
of
their
hounds
had
been
torn
to
pieces
and
completely
devoured
by
the
ravenous
fish
it
was
a
further
illustration
of
the
uncertainty
of
temper
and
behavior
of
these
ferocious
little
monsters
in
other
lagoons
they
had
again
and
again
left
us
and
our
dogs
unmolested
they
vary
locally
in
aggressiveness
just
as
sharks
and
crocodiles
in
different
seas
and
rivers
vary
on
the
morning
of
january
we
started
out
for
a
tapirs
are
hunted
with
canoes
as
they
dwell
in
thick
jungle
and
take
to
the
water
when
hounds
follow
them
in
this
region
there
were
extensive
and
big
lagoons
back
from
the
river
and
often
the
tapirs
fled
to
these
for
refuge
throwing
off
the
hounds
in
these
places
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
get
them
our
best
chance
was
to
keep
to
the
river
in
canoes
and
paddle
toward
the
spot
in
the
direction
of
which
the
hounds
by
the
noise
seemed
to
be
heading
we
started
in
four
canoes
three
of
them
were
indian
dugouts
very
low
in
the
water
the
fourth
was
our
canadian
canoe
a
beauty
light
safe
roomy
made
of
thin
slats
of
wood
and
canvas
colonel
rondon
fiala
with
his
camera
and
i
went
in
this
canoe
together
with
two
paddlers
the
paddlers
were
natives
of
the
poorer
class
they
were
good
men
the
bowsman
was
of
nearly
pure
white
blood
the
steersman
was
of
nearly
pure
negro
blood
and
was
evidently
the
stronger
character
and
better
man
of
the
two
the
other
canoes
carried
a
couple
of
fazendeiros
ranchmen
who
had
come
up
from
caceres
with
their
dogs
these
dugouts
were
manned
by
indian
and
paddlers
and
the
fazendeiros
who
were
of
nearly
pure
white
blood
also
at
times
paddled
vigorously
all
were
dressed
in
substantially
similar
clothes
the
difference
being
that
those
of
the
camaradas
the
poorer
men
or
laborers
were
in
tatters
in
the
canoes
no
man
wore
anything
save
a
shirt
trousers
and
hat
the
feet
being
bare
on
horseback
they
wore
long
leather
leggings
which
were
really
simply
high
rather
flexible
boots
with
the
soles
off
their
spurs
were
on
their
tough
bare
feet
there
was
every
gradation
between
and
among
the
nearly
pure
whites
negroes
and
indians
on
the
whole
there
was
the
most
white
blood
in
the
upper
ranks
and
most
indian
and
negro
blood
among
the
camaradas
but
there
were
exceptions
in
both
classes
and
there
was
no
discrimination
on
account
of
color
all
alike
were
courteous
and
friendly
the
hounds
were
at
first
carried
in
two
of
the
dugouts
and
then
let
loose
on
the
banks
we
went
for
a
couple
of
hours
against
the
swift
current
the
paddlers
making
good
headway
with
their
pointed
paddles
the
broad
blade
of
each
paddle
was
tipped
with
a
long
point
so
that
it
could
be
thrust
into
the
mud
to
keep
the
low
dugout
against
the
bank
the
tropical
forest
came
down
almost
like
a
wall
the
tall
trees
laced
together
with
vines
and
the
spaces
between
their
trunks
filled
with
a
low
dense
jungle
in
most
places
it
could
only
be
penetrated
by
a
man
with
a
machete
with
few
exceptions
the
trees
were
unknown
to
me
and
their
native
names
told
me
nothing
on
most
of
them
the
foliage
was
thick
among
the
exceptions
were
the
cecropias
growing
by
preference
on
alluvial
soil
bare
of
other
trees
whose
rather
scanty
leaf
bunches
were
as
i
was
informed
the
favorite
food
of
sloths
we
saw
one
or
two
squirrels
among
the
trees
and
a
family
of
monkeys
there
were
few
in
the
river
and
no
save
an
occasional
cormorant
but
as
we
pushed
along
near
the
shore
where
the
branches
overhung
and
dipped
in
the
swirling
water
we
continually
roused
little
flocks
of
bats
they
were
hanging
from
the
boughs
right
over
the
river
and
when
our
approach
roused
them
they
zigzagged
rapidly
in
front
of
us
for
a
few
rods
and
then
again
dove
in
among
the
branches
at
last
we
landed
at
a
point
of
ground
where
there
was
little
jungle
and
where
the
forest
was
composed
of
palms
and
was
fairly
open
it
was
a
lovely
bit
of
forest
the
colonel
strolled
off
in
one
direction
returning
an
hour
later
with
a
squirrel
for
the
naturalists
meanwhile
fiala
and
i
went
through
the
palm
wood
to
a
many
trails
led
through
the
woods
and
especially
along
the
borders
of
the
swamp
and
although
their
principal
makers
had
evidently
been
cattle
yet
there
were
in
them
footprints
of
both
tapir
and
deer
the
tapir
makes
a
footprint
much
like
that
of
a
small
rhinoceros
being
one
of
the
ungulates
we
could
hear
the
dogs
now
and
then
evidently
scattered
and
running
on
various
trails
they
were
a
worthless
lot
of
they
would
chase
tapir
or
deer
or
anything
else
that
ran
away
from
them
as
long
as
the
trail
was
easy
to
follow
but
they
were
not
stanch
even
after
animals
that
fled
and
they
would
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
animals
that
were
formidable
while
standing
by
the
marsh
we
heard
something
coming
along
one
of
the
game
paths
in
a
moment
a
buck
of
the
bigger
species
of
bush
deer
appeared
a
very
pretty
and
graceful
creature
it
stopped
and
darted
back
as
soon
as
it
saw
us
giving
us
no
chance
for
a
shot
but
in
another
moment
we
caught
glimpses
of
it
running
by
at
full
speed
back
among
the
palms
i
covered
an
opening
between
two
by
good
luck
the
buck
appeared
in
the
right
place
giving
me
just
time
to
hold
well
ahead
of
him
and
fire
at
the
report
he
went
down
in
a
heap
the
bullet
going
in
at
one
shoulder
and
ranging
forward
breaking
the
neck
the
leaden
portion
of
the
bullet
in
the
proper
mushroom
or
umbrella
shape
stopped
under
the
neck
skin
on
the
farther
side
it
is
a
very
effective
bullet
miller
particularly
wished
specimens
of
these
various
species
of
bush
deer
because
their
mutual
relationships
have
not
yet
been
satisfactorily
worked
out
this
was
an
old
buck
the
antlers
were
single
spikes
five
or
six
inches
long
they
were
old
and
white
and
would
soon
have
been
shed
in
the
stomach
were
the
remains
of
both
leaves
and
grasses
but
especially
the
former
the
buck
was
both
a
browser
and
grazer
there
were
also
seeds
but
no
berries
or
nuts
such
as
i
have
sometimes
found
in
deer
stomachs
this
species
which
is
abundant
in
this
neighborhood
is
solitary
in
its
habits
not
going
in
herds
at
this
time
the
rut
was
past
the
bucks
no
longer
sought
the
does
the
fawns
had
not
been
born
and
the
yearlings
had
left
their
mothers
so
that
each
animal
usually
went
by
itself
when
chased
they
were
very
apt
to
take
to
the
water
this
instinct
of
taking
to
the
water
by
the
way
is
quite
explicable
as
regards
both
deer
and
tapir
for
it
affords
them
refuge
against
their
present
day
natural
foes
but
it
is
a
little
puzzling
to
see
the
jaguar
readily
climbing
trees
to
escape
dogs
for
ages
have
passed
since
there
were
in
its
habitat
any
natural
foes
from
which
it
needed
to
seek
safety
in
trees
but
it
is
possible
that
the
habit
has
been
kept
alive
by
its
seeking
refuge
in
them
on
occasion
from
the
big
peccaries
which
are
among
the
beasts
on
which
it
ordinarily
preys
we
hung
the
buck
in
a
tree
the
colonel
returned
and
not
long
afterward
one
of
the
paddlers
who
had
been
watching
the
river
called
out
to
us
that
there
was
a
tapir
in
the
water
a
good
distance
stream
and
that
two
of
the
other
boats
were
after
it
we
jumped
into
the
canoe
and
the
two
paddlers
dug
their
blades
in
the
water
as
they
drove
her
against
the
strong
current
edging
over
for
the
opposite
bank
the
tapir
was
coming
at
a
great
rate
only
its
queer
head
above
water
while
the
dugouts
were
closing
rapidly
on
it
the
paddlers
uttering
loud
cries
as
the
tapir
turned
slightly
to
one
side
or
the
other
the
long
slightly
upturned
snout
and
the
strongly
pronounced
arch
of
the
crest
along
the
head
and
upper
neck
gave
it
a
marked
and
unusual
aspect
i
could
not
shoot
for
it
was
directly
in
line
with
one
of
the
pursuing
dugouts
suddenly
it
dived
the
snout
being
slightly
curved
downward
as
it
did
so
there
was
no
trace
of
it
we
gazed
eagerly
in
all
directions
the
dugout
in
front
came
alongside
our
canoe
and
the
paddlers
rested
their
paddles
ready
then
we
made
out
the
tapir
clambering
up
the
bank
it
had
dived
at
right
angles
to
the
course
it
was
following
and
swum
under
water
to
the
very
edge
of
the
shore
rising
under
the
overhanging
at
a
point
where
a
for
game
led
down
a
break
in
the
bank
the
branches
partially
hid
it
and
it
was
in
deep
shadow
so
that
it
did
not
offer
a
very
good
shot
my
bullet
went
into
its
body
too
far
back
and
the
tapir
disappeared
in
the
forest
at
a
gallop
as
if
unhurt
although
the
bullet
really
secured
it
by
making
it
unwilling
to
trust
to
its
speed
and
leave
the
neighborhood
of
the
water
three
or
four
of
the
hounds
were
by
this
time
swimming
the
river
leaving
the
others
yelling
on
the
opposite
side
and
as
soon
as
the
swimmers
reached
the
shore
they
were
put
on
the
tapir
trail
and
galloped
after
it
giving
tongue
in
a
couple
of
minutes
we
saw
the
tapir
take
to
the
water
far
and
after
it
we
went
as
fast
as
the
paddles
could
urge
us
through
the
water
we
were
not
in
time
to
head
it
but
fortunately
some
of
the
dogs
had
come
down
to
the
river
edge
at
the
very
point
where
the
tapir
was
about
to
land
and
turned
it
back
two
or
three
of
the
dogs
were
swimming
we
were
more
than
half
the
breadth
of
the
river
away
from
the
tapir
and
somewhat
when
it
dived
it
made
an
astonishingly
long
swim
beneath
the
water
this
time
almost
as
if
it
had
been
a
hippopotamus
for
it
passed
completely
under
our
canoe
and
rose
between
us
and
the
hither
bank
i
shot
it
the
bullet
going
into
its
brain
while
it
was
thirty
or
forty
yards
from
shore
it
sank
at
once
there
was
now
nothing
to
do
but
wait
until
the
body
floated
i
feared
that
the
strong
current
would
roll
it
over
the
river
bed
but
my
companions
assured
me
that
this
was
not
so
and
that
the
body
would
remain
where
it
was
until
it
rose
which
would
be
in
an
hour
or
two
they
were
right
except
as
to
the
time
for
over
a
couple
of
hours
we
paddled
or
anchored
ourselves
by
clutching
branches
close
to
the
spot
or
else
drifted
down
a
mile
and
paddled
up
again
near
the
shore
to
see
if
the
body
had
caught
anywhere
then
we
crossed
the
river
and
had
lunch
at
the
lovely
natural
where
the
buck
was
hung
up
we
had
very
nearly
given
up
the
tapir
when
it
suddenly
floated
only
a
few
rods
from
where
it
had
sunk
with
no
little
difficulty
the
big
round
black
body
was
hoisted
into
the
canoe
and
we
all
turned
our
prows
the
skies
had
been
lowering
for
some
time
and
now
too
late
to
interfere
with
the
hunt
or
cause
us
any
annoyance
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
came
on
and
beat
upon
us
little
we
cared
as
the
canoe
raced
forward
with
the
tapir
and
the
buck
lying
in
the
bottom
and
a
dry
comfortable
camp
ahead
of
us
when
we
reached
camp
and
father
zahm
saw
the
tapir
he
reminded
me
of
something
i
had
completely
forgotten
when
some
six
years
previously
he
had
spoken
to
me
in
the
white
house
about
taking
this
south
american
trip
i
had
answered
that
i
could
not
as
i
intended
to
go
to
africa
but
added
that
i
hoped
some
day
to
go
to
south
america
and
that
if
i
did
so
i
should
try
to
shoot
both
a
jaguar
and
a
tapir
as
they
were
the
characteristic
animals
of
the
country
well
said
father
zahm
now
you
shot
them
both
the
storm
continued
heavy
until
after
sunset
then
the
rain
stopped
and
the
full
moon
broke
through
the
father
zahm
and
i
walked
up
and
down
in
the
moonlight
talking
of
many
things
from
dante
and
our
own
plans
for
the
future
to
the
deeds
and
the
wanderings
of
the
spanish
conquistadores
in
their
search
for
the
gilded
king
and
of
the
portuguese
adventurers
who
then
divided
with
them
the
mastery
of
the
oceans
and
of
the
unknown
continents
beyond
this
was
an
attractive
and
interesting
camp
in
more
ways
than
one
the
vaqueiros
with
their
wives
and
families
were
housed
on
the
two
sides
of
the
field
in
which
our
tents
were
pitched
on
one
side
was
a
big
whitewashed
house
in
which
the
foreman
dwelt
an
skinned
slightly
built
wiry
man
with
an
wife
and
eight
as
pretty
children
as
one
could
wish
to
see
he
usually
went
barefoot
and
his
manners
were
not
merely
good
but
distinguished
corrals
and
outbuildings
were
near
this
big
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
field
stood
the
row
of
thatched
huts
in
which
the
ordinary
cowhands
lived
with
their
dusky
helpmeets
and
children
each
night
from
these
quarters
we
heard
the
faint
sounds
of
a
music
that
went
far
back
of
civilization
to
a
savage
ancestry
near
by
in
point
of
time
and
otherwise
immeasurably
remote
for
through
the
still
hot
air
under
the
brilliant
moonlight
we
heard
the
monotonous
throbbing
of
a
tomtom
drum
and
the
twanging
of
some
old
stringed
instrument
the
small
black
here
always
called
crows
were
as
tame
as
chickens
near
the
big
house
walking
on
the
ground
or
perched
in
the
trees
beside
the
corral
waiting
for
the
offal
of
the
slaughtered
cattle
two
near
our
tent
were
crowded
with
the
long
hanging
nests
of
one
of
the
cacique
orioles
we
lived
well
with
plenty
of
tapir
beef
which
was
good
and
venison
of
the
bush
deer
which
was
excellent
and
as
much
ordinary
beef
as
we
wished
and
fresh
milk
too
a
rarity
in
this
country
there
were
very
few
mosquitoes
and
everything
was
as
comfortable
as
possible
the
tapir
i
killed
was
a
big
one
i
did
not
wish
to
kill
another
unless
of
course
it
became
advisable
to
do
so
for
food
whereas
i
did
wish
to
get
some
specimens
of
the
big
peccary
the
queixa
pronounced
cashada
of
the
brazilians
which
would
make
our
collection
of
the
big
mammals
of
the
brazilian
forests
almost
complete
the
remaining
members
of
the
party
killed
two
or
three
more
tapirs
one
was
a
bull
full
grown
but
very
much
smaller
than
the
animal
i
had
killed
the
hunters
said
that
this
was
a
distinct
kind
the
skull
and
skin
were
sent
back
with
the
other
specimens
to
the
american
museum
where
after
due
examination
and
comparison
its
specific
identify
will
be
established
tapirs
are
solitary
beasts
two
are
rarely
found
together
except
in
the
case
of
a
cow
and
its
spotted
and
streaked
calf
they
live
in
dense
cover
usually
lying
down
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
coming
out
to
feed
and
going
to
the
river
or
to
some
lagoon
to
bathe
and
swim
from
this
camp
sigg
took
lieutenant
lyra
back
to
caceres
to
get
something
that
had
been
overlooked
they
went
in
a
rowboat
to
which
the
motor
had
been
attached
and
at
night
on
the
way
back
almost
ran
over
a
tapir
that
was
swimming
but
in
unfrequented
places
tapirs
both
feed
and
bathe
during
the
day
the
stomach
of
the
one
i
shot
contained
big
they
had
been
swallowed
without
enough
mastication
to
break
the
kernel
the
outer
pulp
being
what
the
tapir
prized
tapirs
gallop
well
and
their
tough
hide
and
wedge
shape
enable
them
to
go
at
speed
through
very
dense
cover
they
try
to
stamp
on
and
even
to
bite
a
foe
but
are
only
clumsy
fighters
the
tapir
is
a
very
archaic
type
of
ungulate
not
unlike
the
specialized
beasts
of
the
oligocene
from
some
such
ancestral
type
the
highly
specialized
modern
horse
has
evolved
while
during
the
uncounted
ages
that
saw
the
horse
thus
develop
the
tapir
has
continued
substantially
unchanged
originally
the
tapirs
dwelt
in
the
northern
hemisphere
but
there
they
gradually
died
out
the
more
specialized
horse
and
even
for
long
ages
the
rhinoceros
persisting
after
they
had
vanished
and
nowadays
the
surviving
tapirs
are
found
in
malaysia
and
south
america
far
from
their
original
home
the
relations
of
the
horse
and
tapir
in
the
paleontological
history
of
south
america
are
very
curious
both
were
geologically
speaking
comparatively
recent
immigrants
and
if
they
came
at
different
dates
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
horse
came
later
the
horse
for
an
age
or
two
certainly
for
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
throve
greatly
and
developed
not
only
several
different
species
but
even
different
genera
it
was
much
the
most
highly
specialized
of
the
two
and
in
the
other
continental
regions
where
both
were
found
the
horse
outlasted
the
tapir
but
in
south
america
the
tapir
outlasted
the
horse
from
unknown
causes
the
various
genera
and
species
of
horses
died
out
while
the
tapir
has
persisted
the
highly
specialized
highly
developed
beasts
which
represented
such
a
full
evolutionary
development
died
out
while
their
less
specialized
remote
kinsfolk
which
had
not
developed
clung
to
life
and
throve
and
this
although
the
direct
reverse
was
occurring
in
north
america
and
in
the
old
world
it
is
one
of
the
innumerable
and
at
present
insoluble
problems
in
the
history
of
life
on
our
planet
i
spent
a
couple
of
days
of
hard
work
in
getting
the
big
peccaries
being
rather
a
misnomer
as
the
entire
under
jaw
and
lower
cheek
are
white
they
were
said
to
be
found
on
the
other
side
of
and
some
distance
back
from
the
river
colonel
rondon
had
sent
out
one
of
our
attendants
an
old
follower
of
his
a
parecis
indian
to
look
for
tracks
this
was
an
excellent
man
who
dressed
and
behaved
just
like
the
other
good
men
we
had
and
was
called
antonio
parecis
he
found
the
tracks
of
a
herd
of
thirty
or
forty
cashadas
and
the
following
morning
we
started
after
them
on
the
first
day
we
killed
nothing
we
were
rather
too
large
a
party
for
one
or
two
of
the
visiting
fazendeiros
came
along
with
their
dogs
i
doubt
whether
these
men
very
much
wished
to
overtake
our
game
for
the
big
peccary
is
a
murderous
foe
of
dogs
and
is
sometimes
dangerous
to
men
one
of
their
number
frankly
refused
to
come
or
to
let
his
dogs
come
explaining
that
the
fierce
wild
swine
were
very
badly
brought
up
a
literal
translation
of
his
words
and
that
respectable
dogs
and
men
ought
not
to
go
near
them
the
other
fazendeiros
merely
feared
for
their
dogs
a
groundless
fear
i
believe
as
i
do
not
think
that
the
dogs
could
by
any
exertion
have
been
dragged
into
dangerous
proximity
with
such
foes
the
ranch
foreman
benedetto
came
with
us
and
two
or
three
other
camaradas
including
antonio
the
parecis
indian
the
horses
were
swum
across
the
river
each
being
led
beside
a
dugout
then
we
crossed
with
the
dogs
our
horses
were
saddled
and
we
started
it
was
a
picturesque
cavalcade
the
native
hunters
of
every
shade
from
white
to
dark
copper
all
wore
leather
leggings
that
left
the
soles
of
their
feet
bare
and
on
their
bare
heels
wore
spurs
with
wheels
four
inches
across
they
went
in
single
file
for
no
other
mode
of
travel
was
possible
and
the
two
or
three
leading
men
kept
their
machetes
out
and
had
to
cut
every
yard
of
our
way
while
we
were
in
the
forest
the
hunters
rode
little
stallions
and
their
hounds
were
gelded
most
of
the
time
we
were
in
forest
or
swampy
jungle
part
of
the
time
we
crossed
or
skirted
marshy
plains
in
one
of
them
a
herd
of
wild
cattle
was
feeding
herons
storks
ducks
and
ibises
were
in
these
marshes
and
we
saw
one
flock
of
lovely
roseate
spoonbills
in
one
grove
the
were
killing
the
palms
just
as
in
africa
they
kill
the
in
the
gloom
of
this
grove
there
were
no
flowers
no
bushes
the
air
was
heavy
the
ground
was
brown
with
mouldering
leaves
almost
every
palm
was
serving
as
a
prop
for
a
tree
the
were
in
every
stage
of
growth
the
youngest
ones
merely
ran
up
the
palms
as
vines
in
the
next
stage
the
vine
had
thickened
and
was
sending
out
shoots
wrapping
the
palm
stem
in
a
deadly
hold
some
of
the
shoots
were
thrown
round
the
stem
like
the
tentacles
of
an
immense
cuttlefish
others
looked
like
claws
that
were
hooked
into
every
crevice
and
round
every
projection
in
the
stage
beyond
this
the
palm
had
been
killed
and
its
dead
carcass
appeared
between
the
big
winding
and
later
the
palm
had
disappeared
and
the
vines
had
united
into
a
great
water
stood
in
black
pools
at
the
foot
of
the
murdered
trees
and
of
the
trees
that
had
murdered
them
there
was
something
sinister
and
evil
in
the
dark
stillness
of
the
grove
it
seemed
as
if
sentient
beings
had
writhed
themselves
round
and
were
strangling
other
sentient
beings
we
passed
through
wonderfully
beautiful
woods
of
tall
palms
the
ouaouaca
palm
wawasa
palm
as
it
should
be
spelled
in
english
the
trunks
rose
tall
and
strong
and
slender
and
the
fronds
were
branches
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long
with
the
many
long
narrow
green
blades
starting
from
the
midrib
at
right
angles
in
pairs
round
the
ponds
stood
stately
burity
palms
rising
like
huge
columns
with
great
branches
that
looked
like
fans
as
the
long
stiff
blades
radiated
from
the
end
of
the
midrib
one
tree
was
gorgeous
with
the
brilliant
hues
of
a
flock
of
macaws
green
parrots
flew
shrieking
overhead
now
and
then
we
were
bitten
and
stung
by
the
venomous
and
ticks
crawled
upon
us
once
we
were
assailed
by
more
serious
foes
in
the
shape
of
a
nest
of
maribundi
wasps
not
the
biggest
kind
but
about
the
size
of
our
hornets
we
were
at
the
time
passing
through
dense
jungle
under
tall
trees
in
a
spot
where
the
down
timber
holes
tangled
creepers
and
thorns
made
the
going
difficult
the
leading
men
were
not
assailed
although
they
were
now
and
then
cutting
the
trail
colonel
rondon
and
i
were
in
the
middle
of
the
column
and
the
swarm
attacked
us
both
of
us
were
badly
stung
on
the
face
neck
and
hands
the
colonel
even
more
severely
than
i
was
he
wheeled
and
rode
to
the
rear
and
i
to
the
front
our
horses
were
stung
too
and
we
went
at
a
rate
that
a
moment
previously
i
would
have
deemed
impossible
over
such
ground
at
the
close
of
the
day
when
we
were
almost
back
at
the
river
the
dogs
killed
a
jaguar
kitten
there
was
no
trace
of
the
mother
some
accident
must
have
befallen
her
and
the
kitten
was
trying
to
shift
for
herself
she
was
very
emaciated
in
her
stomach
were
the
remains
of
a
pigeon
and
some
tendons
from
the
skeleton
or
dried
carcass
of
some
big
animal
the
loathsome
berni
flies
which
deposit
eggs
in
living
beings
cattle
dogs
monkeys
rodents
men
had
been
at
it
there
were
seven
huge
white
grubs
making
big
swellings
over
its
eyes
these
flies
deposit
their
grubs
in
men
in
on
colonel
rondon
hardest
trip
every
man
of
the
party
had
from
one
to
five
grubs
deposited
in
him
the
fly
acting
with
great
speed
and
driving
its
ovipositor
through
clothing
the
grubs
cause
torture
but
a
couple
of
cross
cuts
with
a
lancet
permit
the
loathsome
creatures
to
be
squeezed
out
in
these
forests
the
multitude
of
insects
that
bite
sting
devour
and
prey
upon
other
creatures
often
with
accompaniments
of
atrocious
suffering
passes
belief
the
very
pathetic
myth
of
beneficent
nature
could
not
deceive
even
the
least
wise
being
if
he
once
saw
for
himself
the
iron
cruelty
of
life
in
the
tropics
of
course
nature
in
common
parlance
a
wholly
inaccurate
term
by
the
way
especially
when
used
as
if
to
express
a
single
entity
is
entirely
ruthless
no
less
so
as
regards
types
than
as
regards
individuals
and
entirely
indifferent
to
good
or
evil
and
works
out
her
ends
or
no
ends
with
utter
disregard
of
pain
and
woe
the
following
morning
at
sunrise
we
started
again
this
time
only
colonel
rondon
and
i
went
with
benedetto
and
antonio
the
indian
we
brought
along
four
dogs
which
it
was
fondly
hoped
might
chase
the
cashadas
two
of
them
disappeared
on
the
track
of
a
tapir
and
we
saw
them
no
more
one
of
the
others
promptly
fled
when
we
came
across
the
tracks
of
our
game
and
would
not
even
venture
after
them
in
our
company
the
remaining
one
did
not
actually
run
away
and
occasionally
gave
tongue
but
could
not
be
persuaded
to
advance
unless
there
was
a
man
ahead
of
him
however
colonel
rondon
benedetto
and
antonio
formed
a
trio
of
hunters
who
could
do
fairly
well
without
dogs
after
four
hours
of
riding
benedetto
who
was
in
the
lead
suddenly
stopped
and
pointed
downward
we
were
riding
along
a
grassy
intervale
between
masses
of
forest
and
he
had
found
the
fresh
track
of
a
herd
of
big
peccaries
crossing
from
left
to
right
there
were
apparently
thirty
or
forty
in
the
herd
the
small
peccaries
go
singly
or
in
small
parties
and
when
chased
take
refuge
in
holes
or
hollow
logs
where
they
show
valiant
fight
but
the
big
peccaries
go
in
herds
of
considerable
size
and
are
so
truculent
that
they
are
reluctant
to
run
and
prefer
either
to
move
slowly
off
chattering
their
tusks
and
grunting
or
else
actually
to
charge
where
much
persecuted
the
survivors
gradually
grow
more
willing
to
run
but
their
instinct
is
not
to
run
but
to
trust
to
their
truculence
and
their
for
safety
they
inflict
a
fearful
bite
and
frequently
kill
dogs
they
often
charge
the
hunters
and
i
have
heard
of
men
being
badly
wounded
by
them
while
almost
every
man
who
hunts
them
often
is
occasionally
forced
to
scramble
up
a
tree
to
avoid
a
charge
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
man
being
killed
by
them
they
sometimes
surround
the
tree
in
which
the
man
has
taken
refuge
and
keep
him
up
it
cherrie
on
one
occasion
in
costa
rica
was
thus
kept
up
a
tree
for
several
hours
by
a
great
herd
of
three
or
four
hundred
of
these
peccaries
and
this
although
he
killed
several
of
them
ordinarily
however
after
making
their
charge
they
do
not
turn
but
pass
on
out
of
sight
their
great
foe
is
the
jaguar
but
unless
he
exercises
much
caution
they
will
turn
the
tables
on
him
cherrie
also
in
costa
rica
came
on
the
body
of
a
jaguar
which
had
evidently
been
killed
by
a
herd
of
peccaries
some
hours
previously
the
ground
was
trampled
up
by
their
hoofs
and
the
carcass
was
rent
and
slit
into
pieces
benedetto
as
soon
as
we
discovered
the
tracks
slipped
off
his
horse
changed
his
leggings
for
sandals
threw
his
rifle
over
his
arm
and
took
the
trail
of
the
herd
followed
by
the
only
dog
which
would
accompany
him
the
peccaries
had
gone
into
a
broad
belt
of
forest
with
a
marsh
on
the
farther
side
at
first
antonio
led
the
colonel
and
me
all
of
us
on
horseback
at
a
canter
round
this
belt
to
the
marsh
side
thinking
the
peccaries
had
gone
almost
through
it
but
we
could
hear
nothing
the
dog
only
occasionally
barked
and
then
not
loudly
finally
we
heard
a
shot
benedetto
had
found
the
herd
which
showed
no
fear
of
him
he
had
backed
out
and
fired
a
signal
shot
we
all
three
went
into
the
forest
on
foot
toward
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
it
was
dense
jungle
and
stiflingly
hot
we
could
not
see
clearly
for
more
than
a
few
feet
or
move
easily
without
free
use
of
the
machetes
soon
we
heard
the
ominous
groaning
of
the
herd
in
front
of
us
and
almost
on
each
side
then
benedetto
joined
us
and
the
dog
appeared
in
the
rear
we
moved
slowly
forward
toward
the
sound
of
the
fierce
moaning
grunts
which
were
varied
at
times
by
a
castanet
chattering
of
the
tusks
then
we
dimly
made
out
the
dark
forms
of
the
peccaries
moving
very
slowly
to
the
left
my
companions
each
chose
a
tree
to
climb
at
need
and
pointed
out
one
for
me
i
fired
at
the
form
of
a
hog
through
the
vines
leaves
and
branches
the
colonel
fired
i
fired
three
more
shots
at
other
hogs
and
the
indian
also
fired
the
peccaries
did
not
charge
walking
and
trotting
with
bristles
erect
groaning
and
clacking
their
tusks
they
disappeared
into
the
jungle
we
could
not
see
one
of
them
clearly
and
not
one
was
left
dead
but
a
few
paces
on
we
came
across
one
of
my
wounded
ones
standing
at
bay
by
a
palm
trunk
and
i
killed
it
forthwith
the
dog
would
not
even
trail
the
wounded
ones
but
here
antonio
came
to
the
front
with
eyes
almost
as
quick
and
sure
as
those
of
a
wild
beast
he
had
watched
after
every
shot
and
was
able
to
tell
the
results
in
each
case
he
said
that
in
addition
to
the
one
i
had
just
killed
i
had
wounded
two
others
so
seriously
that
he
did
not
think
they
would
go
far
and
that
colonel
rondon
and
he
himself
had
each
badly
wounded
one
and
moreover
he
showed
the
trails
each
wounded
animal
had
taken
the
event
justified
him
in
a
few
minutes
we
found
my
second
one
dead
then
we
found
antonio
then
we
found
my
third
one
alive
and
at
bay
and
i
killed
it
with
another
bullet
finally
we
found
the
colonel
i
told
him
i
should
ask
the
authorities
of
the
american
museum
to
mount
his
and
one
or
two
of
mine
in
a
group
to
commemorate
our
hunting
together
if
we
had
not
used
crippling
rifles
the
peccaries
might
have
gotten
away
for
in
the
dark
jungle
with
the
masses
of
intervening
leaves
and
branches
it
was
impossible
to
be
sure
of
placing
each
bullet
properly
in
the
moving
beast
we
found
where
the
herd
had
wallowed
in
the
mud
the
stomachs
of
the
peccaries
we
killed
contained
wild
figs
palm
nuts
and
bundles
of
root
fibres
the
dead
beasts
were
covered
with
ticks
they
were
at
least
twice
the
weight
of
the
smaller
peccaries
on
the
ride
home
we
saw
a
buck
of
the
small
species
of
bush
deer
not
half
the
size
of
the
kind
i
had
already
shot
it
was
only
a
patch
of
red
in
the
bush
a
good
distance
off
but
i
was
lucky
enough
to
hit
it
in
spite
of
its
small
size
it
was
a
male
of
a
species
we
had
not
yet
obtained
the
antlers
had
recently
been
shed
and
the
new
antler
growth
had
just
begun
a
great
jabiru
stork
let
us
ride
by
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
off
without
thinking
it
worth
while
to
take
flight
this
day
we
saw
many
of
the
beautiful
violet
orchids
and
in
the
swamps
were
multitudes
of
flowers
red
yellow
lilac
of
which
i
did
not
know
the
names
i
alluded
above
to
the
queer
custom
these
people
in
the
interior
of
brazil
have
of
gelding
their
this
absurd
habit
is
doubtless
the
chief
reason
why
there
are
so
few
hounds
worth
their
salt
in
the
more
serious
kinds
of
hunting
where
the
quarry
is
the
jaguar
or
big
peccary
thus
far
we
had
seen
but
one
dog
as
good
as
the
ordinary
cougar
hound
or
bear
hound
in
such
packs
as
those
with
which
i
had
hunted
in
the
rockies
and
in
the
of
the
lower
mississippi
it
can
hardly
be
otherwise
when
every
dog
that
shows
himself
worth
anything
is
promptly
put
out
of
the
category
of
breeders
the
theory
apparently
being
that
the
dog
will
then
last
longer
all
the
breeding
is
from
worthless
dogs
and
no
dog
of
proved
worth
leaves
descendants
the
country
along
this
river
is
a
fine
natural
cattle
country
and
some
day
it
will
surely
see
a
great
development
it
was
opened
to
development
by
colonel
rondon
only
five
or
six
years
ago
already
an
occasional
cattle
ranch
is
to
be
found
along
the
banks
when
railroads
are
built
into
these
interior
portions
of
matto
grosso
the
whole
region
will
grow
and
thrive
amazingly
and
so
will
the
railroads
the
growth
will
not
be
merely
material
an
immense
amount
will
be
done
in
education
using
the
word
education
in
its
broadest
and
most
accurate
sense
as
applying
to
both
mind
and
spirit
to
both
the
child
and
the
man
colonel
rondon
is
not
merely
an
explorer
he
has
been
and
is
now
a
leader
in
the
movement
for
the
vital
betterment
of
his
people
the
people
of
matto
grosso
the
poorer
people
of
the
back
country
everywhere
suffer
because
of
the
harsh
and
improper
laws
of
debt
in
practice
these
laws
have
resulted
in
establishing
a
system
of
peonage
such
as
has
grown
up
here
and
there
in
our
own
nation
a
radical
change
is
needed
in
this
matter
and
the
colonel
is
fighting
for
the
change
in
school
matters
the
colonel
has
precisely
the
ideas
of
our
wisest
and
most
advanced
men
and
women
in
the
united
states
cherrie
who
is
not
only
an
exceedingly
efficient
naturalist
and
explorer
in
the
tropics
but
is
also
a
thoroughly
good
citizen
at
home
is
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
of
the
town
of
newfane
in
vermont
he
and
the
colonel
and
kermit
and
i
talked
over
school
matters
at
length
and
were
in
hearty
accord
as
to
the
vital
educational
needs
of
both
brazil
and
the
united
states
the
need
of
combining
industrial
with
purely
mental
training
and
the
need
of
having
the
popular
education
which
is
and
must
be
supported
and
paid
for
by
the
government
made
a
purely
governmental
and
absolutely
nonsectarian
function
administered
by
the
state
alone
without
interference
with
nor
furtherance
of
the
beliefs
of
any
reputable
church
the
colonel
is
also
head
of
the
indian
service
of
brazil
being
what
corresponds
roughly
with
our
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
here
also
he
is
taking
the
exact
view
that
is
taken
in
the
united
states
by
the
staunchest
and
wisest
friends
of
the
indians
the
indians
must
be
treated
with
intelligent
and
sympathetic
understanding
no
less
than
with
justice
and
firmness
and
until
they
become
citizens
absorbed
into
the
general
body
politic
they
must
be
the
wards
of
the
nation
and
not
of
any
private
association
lay
or
clerical
no
matter
how
the
sepotuba
river
was
scientifically
explored
and
mapped
for
the
first
time
by
colonel
rondon
in
as
head
of
the
brazilian
telegraphic
commission
this
was
during
the
second
year
of
his
exploration
and
opening
of
the
unknown
northwestern
wilderness
of
matto
grosso
most
of
this
wilderness
had
never
previously
been
trodden
by
the
foot
of
a
civilized
man
not
only
were
careful
maps
made
and
much
other
scientific
work
accomplished
but
posts
were
established
and
constructed
when
colonel
rondon
began
the
work
he
was
a
major
he
was
given
two
promotions
to
colonel
and
colonel
while
absent
in
the
wilderness
his
longest
and
most
important
exploring
trip
and
the
one
fraught
with
most
danger
and
hardship
was
begun
by
him
in
on
may
the
anniversary
of
the
discovery
of
brazil
he
left
tapirapoan
on
that
day
and
he
reached
the
madeira
river
on
christmas
december
of
the
same
year
having
descended
the
the
mouth
of
this
river
had
long
been
known
but
its
upper
course
for
half
its
length
was
absolutely
unknown
when
rondon
descended
it
among
those
who
took
part
under
him
in
this
piece
of
exploration
were
the
present
captain
amilcar
and
lieutenant
lyra
and
two
better
or
more
efficient
men
for
such
wilderness
work
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
they
acted
as
his
two
chief
assistants
on
our
trip
in
the
party
exhausted
all
their
food
including
even
the
salt
by
august
for
the
last
four
months
they
lived
exclusively
on
the
game
they
killed
on
fruits
and
on
wild
honey
their
equipage
was
what
the
men
could
carry
on
their
backs
by
the
time
the
party
reached
the
madeira
they
were
worn
out
by
fatigue
exposure
and
starvation
and
their
enfeebled
bodies
were
racked
by
fever
the
work
of
exploration
accomplished
by
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
during
these
years
was
as
remarkable
as
and
in
its
results
even
more
important
than
any
similar
work
undertaken
elsewhere
on
the
globe
at
or
about
the
same
time
its
value
was
recognized
in
brazil
it
received
no
recognition
by
the
geographical
societies
of
europe
or
the
united
states
the
work
done
by
the
original
explorers
of
such
a
wilderness
necessitates
the
undergoing
of
untold
hardship
and
danger
their
successors
even
their
immediate
successors
have
a
relatively
easy
time
soon
the
road
becomes
so
well
beaten
that
it
can
be
traversed
without
hardship
by
any
man
who
does
not
venture
from
it
although
if
he
goes
off
into
the
wilderness
for
even
a
day
hunting
or
collecting
he
will
have
a
slight
taste
of
what
his
predecessors
endured
the
wilderness
explored
by
colonel
rondon
is
not
yet
wholly
subdued
and
still
holds
menace
to
human
life
at
caceres
he
received
notice
of
the
death
of
one
of
his
gallant
subordinates
captain
cardozo
he
died
from
beriberi
far
out
in
the
wilderness
along
our
proposed
line
of
march
colonel
rondon
also
received
news
that
a
boat
ascending
the
parana
to
carry
provisions
to
meet
those
of
our
party
who
were
to
descend
that
stream
had
been
upset
the
provisions
lost
and
three
men
drowned
the
risk
and
hardship
are
such
that
the
ordinary
men
the
camaradas
do
not
like
to
go
into
the
wilderness
the
men
who
go
with
the
telegraphic
commission
on
the
rougher
and
wilder
work
are
paid
seven
times
as
much
as
they
earn
in
civilization
on
this
trip
of
ours
colonel
rondon
met
with
much
difficulty
in
securing
some
one
who
could
cook
he
asked
the
cook
on
the
little
steamer
nyoac
to
go
with
us
but
the
cook
with
unaffected
horror
responded
senhor
i
have
never
done
anything
to
deserve
punishment
five
days
after
leaving
us
the
launch
with
one
of
the
native
lashed
alongside
returned
on
the
we
broke
camp
loaded
ourselves
and
all
our
belongings
on
the
launch
and
the
boat
and
started
for
tapirapoan
all
told
there
were
about
thirty
men
with
five
dogs
and
tents
bedding
and
provisions
fresh
beef
growing
rapidly
less
fresh
skins
all
and
everything
jammed
together
it
rained
most
of
the
first
day
and
part
of
the
first
night
after
that
the
weather
was
generally
overcast
and
pleasant
for
travelling
but
sometimes
rain
and
torrid
sunshine
alternated
the
cooking
and
it
was
good
cooking
was
done
at
a
funny
little
fireplace
with
two
or
three
placed
at
the
stern
of
the
the
fireplace
was
a
platform
of
earth
taken
from
anthills
and
heaped
and
spread
on
the
boards
of
the
boat
around
it
the
dusky
cook
worked
with
philosophic
solemnity
in
rain
and
shine
our
attendants
friendly
souls
with
skins
of
every
shade
and
hue
slept
most
of
the
time
curled
up
among
boxes
bundles
and
slabs
of
beef
an
enormous
land
turtle
was
tethered
toward
the
bow
of
the
when
the
men
slept
too
near
it
it
made
futile
efforts
to
scramble
over
them
and
in
return
now
and
then
one
of
them
gravely
used
it
for
a
seat
slowly
the
throbbing
engine
drove
the
launch
and
its
unwieldy
partner
against
the
swift
current
the
river
had
risen
we
made
about
a
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
ahead
of
us
the
brown
water
street
stretched
in
curves
between
endless
walls
of
dense
tropical
forest
it
was
like
passing
through
a
gigantic
greenhouse
wawasa
and
burity
palms
cecropias
huge
figs
feathery
bamboos
strange
trees
low
trees
with
enormous
leaves
tall
trees
with
foliage
as
delicate
as
lace
trees
with
buttressed
trunks
trees
with
boles
rising
smooth
and
straight
to
lofty
heights
all
woven
together
by
a
tangle
of
vines
crowded
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
their
drooping
branches
hung
down
to
the
water
forming
a
screen
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
bank
and
exceedingly
difficult
to
penetrate
to
the
bank
rarely
one
of
them
showed
flowers
large
white
blossoms
or
small
red
or
yellow
blossoms
more
often
the
lilac
flowers
of
the
made
large
patches
of
color
innumerable
epiphytes
covered
the
limbs
and
even
grew
on
the
roughened
trunks
we
saw
little
bird
life
a
darter
now
and
then
and
kingfishers
flitting
from
perch
to
perch
at
long
intervals
we
passed
a
ranch
at
one
the
large
whitewashed
house
stood
on
a
grassy
slope
behind
trees
the
wooden
shutters
were
thrown
back
from
the
unglazed
windows
and
the
big
rooms
were
utterly
bare
not
a
book
not
an
ornament
a
palm
loaded
with
scores
of
the
pendulous
nests
of
the
troupials
stood
near
the
door
behind
were
and
and
near
by
fields
of
bananas
rice
and
tobacco
the
sallow
foreman
was
courteous
and
hospitable
his
kept
in
the
furtive
background
like
most
of
the
ranches
it
was
owned
by
a
company
with
headquarters
at
caceres
the
trip
was
pleasant
and
interesting
although
there
was
not
much
to
do
on
the
boat
it
was
too
crowded
to
move
around
save
with
a
definite
purpose
we
enjoyed
the
scenery
we
talked
in
english
portuguese
bad
french
and
broken
german
some
of
us
wrote
fiala
made
sketches
of
improved
tents
hammocks
and
other
field
equipment
suggested
by
what
he
had
already
seen
some
of
us
read
books
colonel
rondon
neat
trim
alert
and
soldierly
studied
a
standard
work
on
applied
geographical
astronomy
father
zahm
read
a
novel
by
fogazzaro
kermit
read
camoens
and
a
couple
of
brazilian
novels
o
guarani
and
innocencia
my
own
reading
varied
from
quentin
durward
and
gibbon
to
the
chanson
de
roland
miller
took
out
his
little
pet
owl
moses
from
the
basket
in
which
moses
dwelt
and
gave
him
food
and
water
moses
crooned
and
chuckled
gratefully
when
he
was
stroked
and
tickled
late
the
first
evening
we
moored
to
the
bank
by
a
little
fazenda
of
the
poorer
type
the
houses
were
of
even
the
walls
were
made
of
the
huge
fronds
or
leafy
branches
of
the
wawasa
palm
stuck
upright
in
the
ground
and
the
blades
plaited
together
some
of
us
went
ashore
some
stayed
on
the
boats
there
were
no
mosquitoes
the
weather
was
not
oppressively
hot
and
we
slept
well
by
five
next
morning
we
had
each
drunk
a
cup
of
delicious
brazilian
coffee
and
the
boats
were
under
way
all
day
we
steamed
slowly
we
passed
two
or
three
fazendas
at
one
where
we
halted
to
get
milk
the
trees
were
overgrown
with
pretty
little
yellow
orchids
at
dark
we
moored
at
a
spot
where
there
were
no
branches
to
prevent
our
placing
the
boats
directly
alongside
the
bank
there
were
hardly
any
mosquitoes
most
of
the
party
took
their
hammocks
ashore
and
the
camp
was
pitched
amid
singularly
beautiful
surroundings
the
trees
were
wawasa
palms
some
with
the
fronds
cresting
very
tall
trunks
some
with
the
fronds
seemingly
longer
rising
almost
from
the
ground
the
fronds
were
of
great
length
some
could
not
have
been
less
than
fifty
feet
long
bushes
and
tall
grass
and
glittering
with
the
green
of
emeralds
grew
in
the
open
spaces
between
we
left
at
sunrise
the
following
morning
one
of
the
sailors
had
strayed
inland
he
got
turned
round
and
could
not
find
the
river
and
we
started
before
discovering
his
absence
we
stopped
at
once
and
with
much
difficulty
he
forced
his
way
through
the
and
jungle
toward
the
sound
of
the
launch
engines
and
of
the
bugle
which
was
blown
in
this
dense
jungle
when
the
sun
is
behind
clouds
a
man
without
a
compass
who
strays
a
hundred
yards
from
the
river
may
readily
become
hopelessly
lost
as
we
ascended
the
river
the
wawasa
palms
became
constantly
more
numerous
at
this
point
for
many
miles
they
gave
their
own
character
to
the
forest
on
the
river
banks
everywhere
their
long
curving
fronds
rose
among
the
other
trees
and
in
places
their
lofty
trunks
made
them
hold
their
heads
higher
than
the
other
trees
but
they
were
never
as
tall
as
the
giants
among
the
ordinary
trees
on
one
towering
palm
we
noticed
a
mass
of
beautiful
violet
orchids
growing
from
the
side
of
the
trunk
to
the
top
on
another
big
tree
not
a
palm
which
stood
in
a
little
opening
there
hung
well
over
a
hundred
troupials
nests
besides
two
or
three
small
ranches
we
this
day
passed
a
large
ranch
the
various
houses
and
sheds
all
stood
by
the
river
in
a
big
space
of
cleared
ground
dotted
with
wawasa
palms
a
native
was
moored
by
the
bank
women
and
children
looked
from
the
unglazed
windows
of
the
houses
men
stood
in
front
of
them
the
biggest
house
was
enclosed
by
a
stockade
of
logs
thrust
into
the
ground
cows
and
oxen
grazed
round
about
and
carts
with
solid
wheels
each
wheel
made
of
a
single
disk
of
wood
were
tilted
on
their
poles
we
made
our
noonday
halt
on
an
island
where
very
tall
trees
grew
bearing
fruits
that
were
pleasant
to
the
taste
other
trees
on
the
island
were
covered
with
rich
red
and
yellow
blossoms
and
masses
of
delicate
blue
flowers
and
of
white
flowers
grew
underfoot
hither
and
thither
across
the
surface
of
the
river
flew
swallows
with
so
much
white
in
their
plumage
that
as
they
flashed
in
the
sun
they
seemed
to
have
bodies
borne
by
dark
wings
the
current
of
the
river
grew
swifter
there
were
stretches
of
broken
water
that
were
almost
rapids
the
laboring
engine
strained
and
sobbed
as
with
increasing
difficulty
it
urged
forward
the
launch
and
her
clumsy
consort
at
nightfall
we
moored
beside
the
bank
where
the
forest
was
open
enough
to
permit
a
comfortable
camp
that
night
the
ants
ate
large
holes
in
miller
and
almost
devoured
his
socks
and
at
sunrise
we
again
started
there
were
occasional
stretches
of
swift
broken
water
almost
rapids
in
the
river
everywhere
the
current
was
swift
and
our
progress
was
slow
the
prancha
was
towed
at
the
end
of
a
hawser
and
her
crew
poled
even
thus
we
only
just
made
the
riffle
in
more
than
one
case
two
or
three
times
cormorants
and
perched
on
snags
in
the
river
or
on
trees
alongside
it
permitted
the
boat
to
come
within
a
few
yards
in
one
piece
of
high
forest
we
saw
a
party
of
toucans
conspicuous
even
among
the
tree
tops
because
of
their
huge
bills
and
the
leisurely
expertness
with
which
they
crawled
climbed
and
hopped
among
the
branches
we
went
by
several
fazendas
shortly
before
noon
january
we
reached
tapirapoan
the
headquarters
of
the
telegraphic
commission
it
was
an
attractive
place
on
the
and
it
was
gayly
bedecked
with
flags
not
only
those
of
brazil
and
the
united
states
but
of
all
the
other
american
republics
in
our
honor
there
was
a
large
green
square
with
trees
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
on
one
side
of
this
square
were
the
buildings
of
the
telegraphic
commission
on
the
other
those
of
a
big
ranch
of
which
this
is
the
headquarters
in
addition
there
were
stables
sheds
outhouses
and
corrals
and
there
were
cultivated
fields
near
by
milch
cows
oxen
and
mules
wandered
almost
at
will
there
were
two
or
three
wagons
and
carts
and
a
traction
automobile
used
in
the
construction
of
the
but
not
available
in
the
rainy
season
at
the
time
of
our
trip
here
we
were
to
begin
our
trip
overland
on
and
scores
of
which
had
been
gathered
to
meet
us
several
days
were
needed
to
apportion
the
loads
and
arrange
for
the
several
divisions
in
which
it
was
necessary
that
so
large
a
party
should
attempt
the
long
wilderness
march
through
a
country
where
there
was
not
much
food
for
man
or
beast
and
where
it
was
always
possible
to
run
into
a
district
in
which
fatal
cattle
or
horse
diseases
were
prevalent
fiala
with
his
usual
efficiency
took
charge
of
handling
the
outfit
of
the
american
portion
of
the
expedition
with
sigg
as
an
active
and
useful
assistant
harper
who
like
the
others
worked
with
zeal
and
cheerfulness
also
helped
him
except
when
he
was
engaged
in
helping
the
naturalists
the
two
latter
cherrie
and
miller
had
so
far
done
the
hardest
and
the
best
work
of
the
expedition
they
had
collected
about
a
thousand
birds
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
mammals
it
was
not
probable
that
they
would
do
as
well
during
the
remainder
of
our
trip
for
we
intended
thenceforth
to
halt
as
little
and
march
as
steadily
as
the
country
the
weather
and
the
condition
of
our
means
of
transportation
permitted
i
kept
continually
wishing
that
they
had
more
time
in
which
to
study
the
absorbingly
interesting
of
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
beasts
and
birds
we
were
all
the
time
seeing
every
museum
must
still
employ
competent
collectors
but
i
think
that
a
museum
could
now
confer
most
lasting
benefit
and
could
do
work
of
most
permanent
good
by
sending
out
into
the
immense
wildernesses
where
wild
nature
is
at
her
best
trained
observers
with
the
gift
of
recording
what
they
have
observed
such
men
should
be
collectors
for
collecting
is
still
necessary
but
they
should
also
and
indeed
primarily
be
able
themselves
to
see
and
to
set
vividly
before
the
eyes
of
others
the
full
of
the
creatures
that
dwell
in
the
waste
spaces
of
the
world
at
this
point
both
cherrie
and
miller
collected
a
number
of
mammals
and
birds
which
they
had
not
previously
obtained
whether
any
were
new
to
science
could
only
be
determined
after
the
specimens
reached
the
american
museum
while
making
the
round
of
his
small
mammal
traps
one
morning
miller
encountered
an
army
of
the
formidable
foraging
ants
the
species
was
a
large
black
one
moving
with
a
front
these
ants
sometimes
called
like
the
of
africa
move
in
big
bodies
and
destroy
or
make
prey
of
every
living
thing
that
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
get
out
of
their
path
in
time
they
run
fast
and
everything
runs
away
from
their
advance
insects
form
their
chief
prey
and
the
most
dangerous
and
aggressive
life
creatures
make
astonishingly
little
resistance
to
them
attention
was
first
attracted
to
this
army
of
ants
by
noticing
a
big
centipede
nine
or
ten
inches
long
trying
to
flee
before
them
a
number
of
ants
were
biting
it
and
it
writhed
at
each
bite
but
did
not
try
to
use
its
long
curved
jaws
against
its
assailants
on
other
occasions
he
saw
big
scorpions
and
big
hairy
spiders
trying
to
escape
in
the
same
way
and
showing
the
same
helpless
inability
to
injure
their
ravenous
foes
or
to
defend
themselves
the
ants
climb
trees
to
a
great
height
much
higher
than
most
birds
nests
and
at
once
kill
and
tear
to
pieces
any
fledglings
in
the
nests
they
reach
but
they
are
not
as
common
as
some
writers
seem
to
imagine
days
may
elapse
before
their
armies
are
encountered
and
doubtless
most
nests
are
never
visited
or
threatened
by
them
in
some
instances
it
seems
likely
that
the
birds
save
themselves
and
their
young
in
other
ways
some
nests
are
inaccessible
from
others
it
is
probable
that
the
parents
remove
the
young
miller
once
in
guiana
had
been
watching
for
some
days
a
nest
of
which
contained
young
going
thither
one
morning
he
found
the
tree
and
the
nest
itself
swarming
with
foraging
ants
he
at
first
thought
that
the
fledglings
had
been
devoured
but
he
soon
saw
the
parents
only
about
thirty
yards
off
with
food
in
their
beaks
they
were
engaged
in
entering
a
dense
part
of
the
jungle
coming
out
again
without
food
in
their
beaks
and
soon
reappearing
once
more
with
food
miller
never
found
their
new
nests
but
their
actions
left
him
certain
that
they
were
feeding
their
young
which
they
must
have
themselves
removed
from
the
old
nest
these
wrens
hover
in
front
of
and
over
the
columns
of
foraging
ants
feeding
not
only
on
the
other
insects
aroused
by
the
ants
but
on
the
ants
themselves
this
fact
has
been
doubted
but
miller
has
shot
them
with
the
ants
in
their
bills
and
in
their
stomachs
in
numbers
often
hover
over
the
columns
darting
down
at
them
miller
could
not
be
certain
he
had
seen
them
actually
seizing
the
ants
but
this
was
his
belief
i
have
myself
seen
these
ants
plunder
a
nest
of
the
dangerous
and
highly
aggressive
wasps
while
the
wasps
buzzed
about
in
great
excitement
but
seemed
unable
effectively
to
retaliate
i
have
also
seen
them
clear
a
sapling
tenanted
by
their
kinsmen
the
poisonous
red
ants
or
the
fought
and
i
have
no
doubt
injured
or
killed
some
of
their
swarming
and
active
black
foes
but
the
latter
quickly
did
away
with
them
i
have
only
come
across
black
foraging
ants
but
there
are
red
species
they
attack
human
beings
precisely
as
they
attack
all
animals
and
precipitate
flight
is
the
only
resort
around
our
camp
here
butterflies
of
gorgeous
coloring
swarmed
and
there
were
many
fungi
as
delicately
shaped
and
tinted
as
flowers
the
scents
in
the
woods
were
wonderful
there
were
many
whippoorwills
or
rather
brazilian
birds
related
to
them
they
uttered
at
intervals
through
the
night
a
succession
of
notes
suggesting
both
those
of
our
whippoorwill
and
those
of
our
big
of
the
gulf
states
but
not
identical
with
either
there
were
other
birds
which
were
nearly
akin
to
familiar
birds
of
the
united
states
a
colored
catbird
a
robin
and
a
sparrow
belonging
to
the
same
genus
as
our
common
and
sweetheart
sparrow
miller
had
heard
this
sparrow
singing
by
day
and
night
fourteen
thousand
feet
up
on
the
andes
and
its
song
suggested
the
songs
of
both
of
our
sparrows
there
were
doves
and
woodpeckers
of
various
species
other
birds
bore
no
resemblance
to
any
of
ours
one
was
a
perfect
little
gem
with
plumage
that
was
black
purple
and
turquoise
and
brilliant
scarlet
feet
two
of
the
birds
which
cherrie
and
miller
procured
were
of
extraordinary
nesting
habits
one
a
nunlet
in
shape
resembles
a
bluebird
it
is
plumbeous
with
a
fulvous
belly
and
white
tail
coverts
it
is
a
stupid
little
bird
and
does
not
like
to
fly
away
even
when
shot
at
it
catches
its
prey
and
ordinarily
acts
like
a
rather
dull
flycatcher
perching
on
some
dead
tree
swooping
on
insects
and
then
returning
to
its
perch
and
never
going
on
the
ground
to
feed
or
run
about
but
it
nests
in
burrows
which
it
digs
itself
one
bird
usually
digging
while
the
other
bird
perches
in
a
bush
near
by
sometimes
these
burrows
are
in
the
side
of
a
the
sand
being
so
loose
that
it
is
a
marvel
that
it
does
not
cave
in
sometimes
the
burrows
are
in
the
level
plain
running
down
about
three
feet
and
then
rising
at
an
angle
the
nest
consists
of
a
few
leaves
and
grasses
and
the
eggs
are
white
the
other
bird
called
a
nun
or
waxbill
is
about
the
size
of
a
thrush
grayish
in
color
with
a
waxy
red
bill
it
also
burrows
in
the
level
soil
the
burrow
being
five
feet
long
and
over
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
it
heaps
a
pile
of
sticks
and
leaves
at
this
camp
the
heat
was
great
from
to
fahrenheit
and
the
air
very
heavy
being
saturated
with
moisture
and
there
were
many
but
there
were
no
mosquitoes
and
we
were
very
comfortable
thanks
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
ranch
we
fared
sumptuously
with
plenty
of
beef
chickens
and
fresh
milk
two
of
the
brazilian
dishes
were
delicious
canja
a
thick
soup
of
chicken
and
rice
the
best
soup
a
hungry
man
ever
tasted
and
beef
chopped
in
rather
small
pieces
and
served
with
a
but
simple
gravy
the
mule
allotted
me
as
a
was
a
powerful
animal
with
easy
gaits
the
brazilian
government
had
waiting
for
me
a
very
handsome
saddle
and
bridle
i
was
much
pleased
with
both
however
my
exceedingly
rough
and
shabby
clothing
made
an
incongruous
contrast
at
tapirapoan
we
broke
up
our
baggage
as
well
as
our
party
we
sent
forward
the
canadian
canoe
which
with
the
and
some
kerosene
went
in
a
cart
drawn
by
six
oxen
and
a
hundred
sealed
tin
cases
of
provisions
each
containing
rations
for
a
day
for
six
men
they
had
been
put
up
in
new
york
under
the
special
direction
of
fiala
for
use
when
we
got
where
we
wished
to
take
good
and
varied
food
in
small
compass
all
the
skins
skulls
and
alcoholic
specimens
and
all
the
baggage
not
absolutely
necessary
were
sent
back
down
the
paraguay
and
to
new
york
in
charge
of
harper
the
separate
under
the
charge
of
captain
amilcar
were
organized
to
go
in
one
detachment
the
main
body
of
the
expedition
consisting
of
the
american
members
and
of
colonel
rondon
lieutenant
lyra
and
doctor
cajazeira
with
their
baggage
and
provisions
formed
another
detachment
vi
through
the
highland
wilderness
of
western
brazil
we
were
now
in
the
land
of
the
bloodsucking
bats
the
vampire
bats
that
suck
the
blood
of
living
creatures
clinging
to
or
hovering
against
the
shoulder
of
a
horse
or
cow
or
the
hand
or
foot
of
a
sleeping
man
and
making
a
wound
from
which
the
blood
continues
to
flow
long
after
the
bat
thirst
has
been
satiated
at
tapirapoan
there
were
milch
cattle
and
one
of
the
calves
turned
up
one
morning
weak
from
loss
of
blood
which
was
still
trickling
from
a
wound
forward
of
the
shoulder
made
by
a
bat
but
the
bats
do
little
damage
in
this
neighborhood
compared
to
what
they
do
in
some
other
places
where
not
only
the
mules
and
cattle
but
the
chickens
have
to
be
housed
behind
protection
at
night
or
their
lives
may
pay
the
penalty
the
chief
and
habitual
offenders
are
various
species
of
rather
small
bats
but
it
is
said
that
other
kinds
of
brazilian
bats
seem
to
have
become
at
least
sporadically
and
locally
affected
by
the
evil
example
and
occasionally
vary
their
customary
diet
by
draughts
of
living
blood
one
of
the
brazilian
members
of
our
party
hoehne
the
botanist
was
a
zoologist
also
he
informed
me
that
he
had
known
even
the
big
bats
to
take
to
bloodsucking
they
did
not
according
to
his
observations
themselves
make
the
original
wound
but
after
it
had
been
made
by
one
of
the
true
vampires
they
would
lap
the
flowing
blood
and
enlarge
the
wound
south
america
makes
up
for
its
lack
relatively
to
africa
and
india
of
large
carnivores
by
the
extraordinary
ferocity
or
bloodthirstiness
of
certain
small
creatures
of
which
the
kinsfolk
elsewhere
are
harmless
it
is
only
here
that
fish
no
bigger
than
trout
kill
swimmers
and
bats
the
size
of
the
ordinary
flittermice
of
the
northern
hemisphere
drain
the
of
big
beasts
and
of
man
himself
there
was
not
much
large
mammalian
life
in
the
neighborhood
kermit
hunted
industriously
and
brought
in
an
occasional
armadillo
coati
or
agouti
for
the
naturalists
miller
trapped
rats
and
a
queer
opossum
new
to
the
collection
cherrie
got
many
birds
cherrie
and
miller
skinned
their
specimens
in
a
little
open
hut
or
shed
moses
the
small
pet
owl
sat
on
a
overhead
an
interested
spectator
and
chuckled
whenever
he
was
petted
two
wrens
who
bred
just
outside
the
hut
were
much
excited
by
the
presence
of
moses
and
paid
him
visits
of
noisy
unfriendliness
the
little
sparrows
came
familiarly
about
the
palm
cabins
and
whitewashed
houses
and
trilled
on
the
rooftrees
it
was
a
simple
song
with
just
a
hint
of
our
northern
sweet
and
plaintive
melody
and
of
the
opening
bars
of
our
pleasant
homely
lay
it
brought
back
dear
memories
of
glorious
april
mornings
on
long
island
when
through
the
singing
of
robin
and
comes
the
piercing
cadence
of
the
meadowlark
and
of
the
far
northland
woods
in
june
fragrant
with
the
breath
of
pine
and
where
sweetheart
sparrows
sing
from
wet
spruce
thickets
and
rapid
brooks
rush
under
the
drenched
and
swaying
boughs
from
tapirapoan
our
course
lay
northward
up
to
and
across
the
plan
alto
the
highland
wilderness
of
brazil
from
the
edges
of
this
highland
country
which
is
geologically
very
ancient
the
affluents
of
the
amazon
to
the
north
and
of
the
plate
to
the
south
flow
with
immense
and
devious
loops
and
windings
two
days
before
we
ourselves
started
with
our
a
train
of
left
loaded
with
provisions
tools
and
other
things
which
we
would
not
need
until
after
a
month
or
six
weeks
we
began
our
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
amazon
there
were
about
seventy
oxen
most
of
them
were
well
broken
but
there
were
about
a
score
which
were
either
not
broken
at
all
or
else
very
badly
broken
these
were
loaded
with
much
difficulty
and
bucked
like
wild
broncos
again
and
again
they
scattered
their
loads
over
the
corral
and
over
the
first
part
of
the
road
the
however
black
and
white
were
not
only
masters
of
their
art
but
possessed
tempers
that
could
not
be
ruffled
when
they
showed
severity
it
was
because
severity
was
needed
and
not
because
they
were
angry
they
finally
got
all
their
longhorned
beasts
loaded
and
started
on
the
trail
with
them
on
january
we
ourselves
started
with
the
of
course
as
always
in
such
a
journey
there
was
some
confusion
before
the
men
and
the
animals
of
the
train
settled
down
to
the
routine
performance
of
duty
in
addition
to
the
we
all
had
the
first
day
we
journeyed
about
twelve
miles
then
crossing
the
sepotuba
and
camping
beside
it
below
a
series
of
falls
or
rather
rapids
the
country
was
level
it
was
a
great
natural
pasture
covered
with
a
very
open
forest
of
low
twisted
trees
bearing
a
superficial
likeness
to
the
of
texas
and
oklahoma
it
is
as
well
fitted
for
as
oklahoma
and
there
is
also
much
fine
agricultural
land
while
the
river
will
ultimately
yield
electric
power
it
is
a
fine
country
for
settlement
the
heat
is
great
at
noon
but
the
nights
are
not
uncomfortable
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
rainy
season
but
hitherto
most
of
the
days
had
been
fine
varied
with
showers
the
astonishing
thing
was
the
absence
of
mosquitoes
insect
pests
that
work
by
day
can
be
stood
and
especially
by
settlers
because
they
are
far
less
serious
foes
in
the
clearings
than
in
the
woods
the
mosquitoes
and
other
night
foes
offer
the
really
serious
and
unpleasant
problem
because
they
break
one
rest
hitherto
during
our
travels
up
the
paraguay
and
its
tributaries
in
this
level
marshy
tropical
region
of
western
brazil
we
had
practically
not
been
bothered
by
mosquitoes
at
all
in
our
home
camps
out
in
the
woods
they
were
at
times
a
serious
nuisance
and
cherrie
and
miller
had
been
subjected
to
real
torment
by
them
during
some
of
their
special
expeditions
but
there
were
practically
none
on
the
ranches
and
in
our
camps
in
the
open
fields
by
the
river
even
when
marshes
were
close
by
i
was
puzzled
and
delighted
by
their
absence
settlers
need
not
be
deterred
from
coming
to
this
region
by
the
fear
of
insect
foes
this
does
not
mean
that
there
are
not
such
foes
outside
of
the
clearings
and
of
the
beaten
tracks
of
travel
they
teem
there
are
ticks
poisonous
ants
wasps
of
which
some
species
are
really
serious
menaces
biting
flies
and
gnats
i
merely
mean
that
unlike
so
many
other
tropical
regions
this
particular
region
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
settler
and
the
ordinary
traveller
relatively
free
from
insect
pests
and
a
pleasant
place
of
residence
the
original
explorer
and
to
an
only
less
degree
the
hardworking
field
naturalist
or
hunter
have
to
face
these
pests
just
as
they
have
to
face
countless
risks
hardships
and
difficulties
this
is
inherent
in
their
several
professions
or
avocations
many
regions
in
the
united
states
where
life
is
now
absolutely
comfortable
and
easygoing
offered
most
formidable
problems
to
the
first
explorers
a
century
or
two
ago
we
must
not
fall
into
the
foolish
error
of
thinking
that
the
first
explorers
need
not
suffer
terrible
hardships
merely
because
the
ordinary
travellers
and
even
the
settlers
who
come
after
them
do
not
have
to
endure
such
danger
privation
and
wearing
fatigue
although
the
first
among
the
genuine
settlers
also
have
to
undergo
exceedingly
trying
experiences
the
early
explorers
and
adventurers
make
fairly
trails
but
it
is
incumbent
on
them
neither
to
boast
of
their
own
experiences
nor
to
misjudge
the
efforts
of
the
pioneers
because
thanks
to
these
very
efforts
their
own
lines
fall
in
pleasant
places
the
ordinary
traveller
who
never
goes
off
the
beaten
route
and
who
on
this
beaten
route
is
carried
by
others
without
himself
doing
anything
or
risking
anything
does
not
need
to
show
much
more
initiative
and
intelligence
than
an
express
package
he
does
nothing
others
do
all
the
work
show
all
the
forethought
take
all
the
risk
and
are
entitled
to
all
the
credit
he
and
his
valise
are
carried
in
practically
the
same
fashion
and
for
each
the
achievement
stands
about
on
the
same
plane
if
this
kind
of
traveller
is
a
writer
he
can
of
course
do
admirable
work
work
of
the
highest
value
but
the
value
comes
because
he
is
a
writer
and
observer
not
because
of
any
particular
credit
that
attaches
to
him
as
a
traveller
we
all
recognize
this
truth
as
far
as
highly
civilized
regions
are
concerned
when
bryce
writes
of
the
american
commonwealth
or
lowell
of
european
legislative
assemblies
our
admiration
is
for
the
insight
and
thought
of
the
observer
and
we
are
not
concerned
with
his
travels
when
a
man
travels
across
arizona
in
a
pullman
car
we
do
not
think
of
him
as
having
performed
a
feat
bearing
even
the
most
remote
resemblance
to
the
feats
of
the
first
explorers
of
those
waterless
wastes
whatever
admiration
we
feel
in
connection
with
his
trip
is
reserved
for
the
engineer
fireman
and
brakeman
but
as
regards
the
continents
such
as
south
america
we
sometimes
fail
to
remember
these
obvious
truths
there
yet
remains
plenty
of
exploring
work
to
be
done
in
south
america
as
hard
as
dangerous
and
almost
as
important
as
any
that
has
already
been
done
work
such
as
has
recently
been
done
or
is
now
being
done
by
men
and
women
such
as
haseman
farrabee
and
miss
snethlage
the
collecting
naturalists
who
go
into
the
wilds
and
do
work
encounter
every
kind
of
risk
and
undergo
every
kind
of
hardship
and
exertion
explorers
and
naturalists
of
the
right
type
have
open
to
them
in
south
america
a
field
of
extraordinary
attraction
and
difficulty
but
to
excavate
ruins
that
have
already
long
been
known
to
visit
towns
that
date
from
colonial
days
to
traverse
old
even
if
uncomfortable
routes
of
travel
or
to
ascend
or
descend
highway
rivers
like
the
amazon
the
paraguay
and
the
lower
orinoco
all
of
these
exploits
are
well
worth
performing
but
they
in
no
sense
represent
exploration
or
adventure
and
they
do
not
entitle
the
performer
no
matter
how
well
he
writes
and
no
matter
how
much
of
real
value
he
contributes
to
human
knowledge
to
compare
himself
in
anyway
with
the
real
wilderness
wanderer
or
to
criticise
the
latter
such
a
performance
entails
no
hardship
or
difficulty
worth
heeding
its
value
depends
purely
on
observation
not
on
action
the
man
does
little
he
merely
records
what
he
sees
he
is
only
the
man
of
the
beaten
routes
the
true
wilderness
wanderer
on
the
contrary
must
be
a
man
of
action
as
well
as
of
observation
he
must
have
the
heart
and
the
body
to
do
and
to
endure
no
less
than
the
eye
to
see
and
the
brain
to
note
and
record
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
depreciating
the
excellent
work
of
so
many
of
the
men
who
have
not
gone
off
the
beaten
trails
i
merely
wish
to
make
it
plain
that
this
excellent
work
must
not
be
put
in
the
class
with
that
of
the
wilderness
explorer
it
is
excellent
work
nevertheless
and
has
its
place
just
as
the
work
of
the
true
explorer
has
its
place
both
stand
in
sharpest
contrast
with
the
actions
of
those
alleged
explorers
among
whom
savage
landor
stands
in
unpleasant
prominence
from
the
sepotuba
rapids
our
course
at
the
outset
lay
westward
the
first
day
march
away
from
the
river
lay
through
dense
tropical
forest
away
from
the
broad
beaten
route
every
step
of
a
progress
represented
slashing
a
trail
with
the
machete
through
the
tangle
of
bushes
low
trees
thorny
scrub
and
interlaced
creepers
there
were
palms
of
new
kinds
very
tall
slender
straight
and
graceful
with
rather
short
and
few
fronds
the
wild
plantains
or
pacovas
thronged
the
spaces
among
the
trunks
of
the
tall
trees
their
boles
were
short
and
their
broad
erect
leaves
gigantic
they
bore
brilliant
flowers
there
were
trees
whose
trunks
bellied
into
huge
swellings
there
were
towering
trees
with
buttressed
trunks
whose
leaves
made
a
fretwork
against
the
sky
far
overhead
gorgeous
trogons
with
long
tails
perched
motionless
on
the
lower
branches
and
uttered
a
loud
whistle
we
heard
the
calling
of
the
false
bellbird
which
is
gray
instead
of
white
like
the
true
bellbirds
it
keeps
among
the
very
topmost
branches
heavy
rain
fell
shortly
after
we
reached
our
next
morning
at
sunrise
we
climbed
a
steep
slope
to
the
edge
of
the
parecis
plateau
at
a
level
of
about
two
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
we
were
on
the
plan
alto
the
high
central
plain
of
brazil
the
healthy
land
of
dry
air
of
cool
nights
of
clear
running
brooks
the
sun
was
directly
behind
us
when
we
topped
the
rise
reining
in
we
looked
back
over
the
vast
paraguayan
marshes
shimmering
in
the
long
morning
lights
then
turning
again
we
rode
forward
casting
shadows
far
before
us
it
was
twenty
miles
to
the
next
water
and
in
hot
weather
the
journey
across
this
waterless
shadeless
sandy
stretch
of
country
is
hard
on
the
mules
and
oxen
but
on
this
day
the
sky
speedily
grew
overcast
and
a
cool
wind
blew
in
our
faces
as
we
travelled
at
a
quick
running
walk
over
the
immense
rolling
plain
the
ground
was
sandy
it
was
covered
with
grass
and
with
a
sparse
growth
of
stunted
twisted
trees
never
more
than
a
few
feet
high
there
were
rheas
ostriches
and
small
on
this
plain
the
coloration
of
the
rheas
made
it
difficult
to
see
them
at
a
distance
whereas
the
bright
red
coats
of
the
little
deer
and
their
uplifted
flags
as
they
ran
advertised
them
afar
off
we
also
saw
the
footprints
of
cougars
and
of
the
big
red
wolf
cougars
are
the
most
inveterate
enemies
of
these
small
south
american
deer
both
those
of
the
open
grassy
plain
and
those
of
the
forest
it
is
not
nearly
as
easy
to
get
lost
on
these
open
plains
as
in
the
dense
forest
and
where
there
is
a
long
reasonably
straight
road
or
river
to
come
back
to
a
man
even
without
a
compass
is
safe
but
in
these
thick
south
american
forests
especially
on
cloudy
days
a
compass
is
an
absolute
necessity
we
were
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
native
hunters
and
ranchmen
on
such
days
continually
lost
themselves
and
if
permitted
travelled
for
miles
through
the
forest
either
in
circles
or
in
exactly
the
wrong
direction
they
had
no
such
sense
of
direction
as
the
hunters
in
africa
had
or
as
the
true
indians
of
south
america
are
said
to
have
on
certainly
half
a
dozen
occasions
our
guides
went
completely
astray
and
we
had
to
take
command
to
disregard
their
assertions
and
to
lead
the
way
aright
by
sole
reliance
on
our
compasses
on
this
cool
day
we
travelled
well
the
air
was
wonderful
the
vast
open
spaces
gave
a
sense
of
abounding
vigor
and
freedom
early
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
station
made
by
colonel
rondon
in
the
course
of
his
first
explorations
there
were
several
houses
with
whitewashed
walls
stone
floors
and
tiled
or
thatched
roofs
they
stood
in
a
wide
gently
sloping
valley
through
it
ran
a
rapid
brook
of
cool
water
in
which
we
enjoyed
delightful
baths
the
heavy
intensely
humid
atmosphere
of
the
low
marshy
plains
had
gone
the
air
was
clear
and
fresh
the
sky
was
brilliant
far
and
wide
we
looked
over
a
landscape
that
seemed
limitless
the
breeze
that
blew
in
our
faces
might
have
come
from
our
own
northern
plains
the
midday
sun
was
very
hot
but
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
we
were
in
the
torrid
zone
there
were
no
mosquitoes
so
that
we
never
put
up
our
nets
when
we
went
to
bed
but
wrapped
ourselves
in
our
blankets
and
slept
soundly
through
the
cool
pleasant
nights
surely
in
the
future
this
region
will
be
the
home
of
a
healthy
highly
civilized
population
it
is
good
for
and
the
valleys
are
fitted
for
agriculture
from
june
to
september
the
nights
are
often
really
cold
any
sound
northern
race
could
live
here
and
in
such
a
land
with
such
a
climate
there
would
be
much
joy
of
living
on
these
plains
the
telegraphic
commission
uses
and
these
now
to
relieve
the
mules
and
oxen
for
some
of
them
especially
among
the
oxen
already
showed
the
effects
of
the
strain
travelling
in
a
wild
country
with
a
is
not
easy
on
the
it
was
strange
to
see
these
big
out
in
the
wilderness
where
there
was
not
a
settler
not
a
civilized
man
except
the
employees
of
the
telegraphic
commission
they
were
handled
by
lieutenant
lauriado
who
with
lieutenant
mello
had
taken
special
charge
of
our
transport
service
both
were
exceptionally
good
and
competent
men
the
following
day
we
again
rode
on
across
the
plan
alto
in
the
early
afternoon
in
the
midst
of
a
downpour
of
rain
we
crossed
the
divide
between
the
basins
of
the
paraguay
and
the
amazon
that
evening
we
camped
on
a
brook
whose
waters
ultimately
ran
into
the
tapajos
the
rain
fell
throughout
the
afternoon
now
lightly
now
heavily
and
the
did
not
get
up
until
dark
but
enough
tents
and
flies
were
pitched
to
shelter
all
of
us
fires
were
lit
and
after
a
fourteen
hours
fast
we
feasted
royally
on
beans
and
rice
and
pork
and
beef
seated
around
spread
upon
the
ground
the
sky
cleared
the
stars
blazed
down
through
the
cool
night
and
wrapped
in
our
blankets
we
slept
soundly
warm
and
comfortable
next
morning
the
trail
had
turned
and
our
course
led
northward
and
at
times
east
of
north
we
traversed
the
same
high
rolling
plains
of
coarse
grass
and
stunted
trees
kermit
riding
a
big
white
mule
rode
off
to
one
side
on
a
hunt
and
rejoined
the
line
of
march
carrying
two
bucks
of
the
little
or
field
deer
behind
his
saddle
these
deer
are
very
pretty
and
graceful
with
a
tail
like
that
of
the
colombian
blacktail
standing
motionless
facing
one
in
the
sparse
scrub
they
are
hard
to
make
out
if
seen
sideways
the
reddish
of
their
coats
contrasted
with
the
greens
and
grays
of
the
landscape
betrays
them
and
when
they
bound
off
the
upraised
white
tail
is
very
conspicuous
they
carefully
avoid
the
woods
in
which
their
cousins
the
little
bush
deer
are
found
and
go
singly
or
in
couples
their
odor
can
be
made
out
at
quite
a
distance
but
it
is
not
rank
they
still
carried
their
antlers
their
venison
was
delicious
we
came
across
many
queer
insects
one
red
grasshopper
when
it
flew
seemed
as
big
as
a
small
sparrow
and
we
passed
in
some
places
such
multitudes
of
active
little
green
grasshoppers
that
they
frightened
the
mules
at
our
we
saw
an
extraordinary
colony
of
spiders
it
was
among
some
dwarf
trees
standing
a
few
yards
apart
from
one
another
by
the
water
when
we
reached
the
early
in
the
afternoon
the
did
not
get
in
until
nearly
sunset
just
ahead
of
the
rain
no
spiders
were
out
they
were
under
the
leaves
of
the
trees
their
webs
were
tenantless
and
indeed
for
the
most
part
were
broken
down
but
at
dusk
they
came
out
from
their
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
in
all
and
at
once
began
to
repair
the
old
and
spin
new
webs
each
spun
its
own
circular
web
and
sat
in
the
middle
and
each
web
was
connected
on
several
sides
with
other
webs
while
those
nearest
the
trees
were
hung
to
them
by
spun
ropes
so
to
speak
the
result
was
a
kind
of
sheet
of
web
consisting
of
scores
of
wheels
in
each
of
which
the
owner
and
proprietor
sat
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
such
sheets
each
extending
between
two
trees
the
webs
could
hardly
be
seen
and
the
effect
was
of
scores
of
big
spiders
poised
in
midair
equidistant
from
one
another
between
each
pair
of
trees
when
darkness
and
rain
fell
they
were
still
out
fixing
their
webs
and
pouncing
on
the
occasional
insects
that
blundered
into
the
webs
i
have
no
question
that
they
are
nocturnal
they
certainly
hide
in
the
daytime
and
it
seems
impossible
that
they
can
come
out
only
for
a
few
minutes
at
dusk
in
the
evenings
after
supper
or
dinner
it
is
hard
to
tell
by
what
title
the
exceedingly
movable
evening
meal
should
be
called
the
members
of
the
party
sometimes
told
stories
of
incidents
in
their
past
lives
most
of
them
were
men
of
varied
experiences
rondon
and
lyra
told
of
the
hardship
and
suffering
of
the
first
trips
through
the
wilderness
across
which
we
were
going
with
such
comfort
on
this
very
plateau
they
had
once
lived
for
weeks
on
the
fruits
of
the
various
trees
naturally
they
became
emaciated
and
feeble
in
the
forests
of
the
amazonian
basin
they
did
better
because
they
often
shot
birds
and
plundered
the
hives
of
the
wild
in
cutting
the
trail
for
the
through
the
juruena
basin
they
lost
every
single
one
of
the
hundred
and
sixty
mules
with
which
they
had
started
those
men
pay
dear
who
build
the
first
foundations
of
empire
fiala
told
of
the
long
polar
nights
and
of
white
bears
that
came
round
the
snow
huts
of
the
explorers
greedy
to
eat
them
and
themselves
destined
to
be
eaten
by
them
of
all
the
party
cherrie
experiences
had
covered
the
widest
range
this
was
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
naturalist
of
the
most
vigorous
type
who
goes
into
the
untrodden
wastes
of
the
world
must
see
and
do
many
strange
things
and
still
more
owing
to
the
character
of
the
man
himself
the
things
he
had
seen
and
done
and
undergone
often
enabled
him
to
cast
the
light
of
his
own
past
experience
on
unexpected
subjects
once
we
were
talking
about
the
proper
weapons
for
cavalry
and
some
one
mentioned
the
theory
that
the
lance
is
especially
formidable
because
of
the
moral
effect
it
produces
on
the
enemy
cherrie
nodded
emphatically
and
a
little
elicited
the
fact
that
he
was
speaking
from
lively
personal
recollection
of
his
own
feelings
when
charged
by
lancers
it
was
while
he
was
fighting
with
the
venezuelan
insurgents
in
an
unsuccessful
uprising
against
the
tyranny
of
castro
he
was
on
foot
with
five
venezuelans
all
cool
men
and
good
shots
in
an
open
plain
they
were
charged
by
twenty
of
castro
lancers
who
galloped
out
from
behind
cover
two
or
three
hundred
yards
off
it
was
a
war
in
which
neither
side
gave
quarter
and
in
which
the
wounded
and
the
prisoners
were
butchered
just
as
president
madero
was
butchered
in
mexico
cherrie
knew
that
it
meant
death
for
him
and
his
companions
if
the
charge
came
home
and
the
sight
of
the
horsemen
running
in
at
full
speed
with
their
long
lances
in
rest
and
the
blades
glittering
left
an
indelible
impression
on
his
mind
but
he
and
his
companions
shot
deliberately
and
accurately
ten
of
the
lancers
were
killed
the
nearest
falling
within
fifty
yards
and
the
others
rode
off
in
headlong
haste
a
cool
man
with
a
rifle
if
he
has
mastered
his
weapon
need
fear
no
foe
at
this
camp
the
again
joined
us
they
were
to
go
direct
to
the
first
telegraph
station
at
the
great
falls
of
the
utiarity
on
the
rio
papagaio
of
course
they
travelled
faster
than
the
father
zahm
attended
by
sigg
started
for
the
falls
in
them
cherrie
and
miller
also
went
in
them
because
they
had
found
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
collect
birds
and
especially
mammals
when
we
were
moving
every
day
packing
up
early
each
morning
and
the
arriving
late
in
the
afternoon
or
not
until
nightfall
moreover
there
was
much
rain
which
made
it
difficult
to
work
except
under
the
tents
accordingly
the
two
naturalists
desired
to
get
to
a
place
where
they
could
spend
several
days
and
collect
steadily
thereby
doing
more
effective
work
the
rest
of
us
continued
with
the
as
was
necessary
it
was
always
a
picturesque
sight
when
camp
was
broken
and
again
at
nightfall
when
the
laden
mules
came
stringing
in
and
their
burdens
were
thrown
down
while
the
tents
were
pitched
and
the
fires
lit
we
breakfasted
before
leaving
camp
the
aluminum
cups
and
plates
being
placed
on
round
which
we
sat
on
the
ground
or
on
stools
we
fared
well
on
rice
beans
and
crackers
with
canned
corned
beef
and
salmon
or
any
game
that
had
been
shot
and
coffee
tea
and
matte
i
then
usually
sat
down
somewhere
to
write
and
when
the
mules
were
nearly
ready
i
popped
my
into
my
as
we
would
have
called
it
in
the
old
days
on
the
plains
i
found
that
the
mules
usually
arrived
so
late
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
that
i
could
not
depend
upon
being
able
to
write
at
that
time
of
course
if
we
made
a
very
early
start
i
could
not
write
at
all
at
night
there
were
no
mosquitoes
in
the
daytime
gnats
and
and
sometimes
bothered
us
a
little
but
not
much
small
stingless
bees
lit
on
us
in
numbers
and
crawled
over
the
skin
making
a
slight
tickling
but
we
did
not
mind
them
until
they
became
very
numerous
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rain
but
not
enough
to
cause
any
serious
annoyance
colonel
rondon
and
lieutenant
lyra
held
many
discussions
as
to
whither
the
rio
da
duvida
flowed
and
where
its
mouth
might
be
its
provisional
name
river
of
doubt
was
given
it
precisely
because
of
this
ignorance
concerning
it
an
ignorance
which
it
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
our
trip
to
dispel
it
might
go
into
the
in
which
case
its
course
must
be
very
short
it
might
flow
into
the
madeira
low
down
in
which
case
its
course
would
be
very
long
or
which
was
unlikely
it
might
flow
into
the
tapajos
there
was
another
river
of
which
colonel
rondon
had
come
across
the
whose
course
was
equally
doubtful
although
in
its
case
there
was
rather
more
probability
of
its
flowing
into
the
juruena
by
which
name
the
tapajos
is
known
for
its
upper
half
to
this
unknown
river
colonel
rondon
had
given
the
name
ananas
because
when
he
came
across
it
he
found
a
deserted
indian
field
with
pineapples
which
the
hungry
explorers
ate
greedily
among
the
things
the
colonel
and
i
hoped
to
accomplish
on
the
trip
was
to
do
a
little
work
in
clearing
up
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
doubtful
geographical
points
and
thereby
to
push
a
little
forward
the
knowledge
of
this
region
originally
as
described
in
the
first
chapter
my
trip
was
undertaken
primarily
in
the
interest
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
of
new
york
to
add
to
our
knowledge
of
the
birds
and
mammals
of
the
far
interior
of
the
western
brazilian
wilderness
and
the
labels
of
our
baggage
and
scientific
equipment
printed
by
the
museum
were
entitled
colonel
roosevelt
south
american
expedition
for
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
but
as
i
have
already
mentioned
at
rio
the
brazilian
government
through
the
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
doctor
lauro
muller
suggested
that
i
should
combine
the
expedition
with
one
by
colonel
rondon
which
they
contemplated
making
and
thereby
make
both
expeditions
of
broader
scientific
interest
i
accepted
the
proposal
with
much
pleasure
and
we
found
when
we
joined
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
that
their
baggage
and
equipment
had
been
labelled
by
the
brazilian
government
expedicao
scientifica
rondon
this
thenceforth
became
the
proper
and
official
title
of
the
expedition
cherrie
and
miller
did
the
chief
zoological
work
the
geological
work
was
done
by
a
brazilian
member
of
the
expedition
euzebio
oliveira
the
astronomical
work
necessary
for
obtaining
the
exact
geographical
location
of
the
rivers
and
points
of
note
was
to
be
done
by
lieutenant
lyra
under
the
supervision
of
colonel
rondon
and
at
the
telegraph
stations
this
astronomical
work
would
be
checked
by
wire
communications
with
one
of
colonel
rondon
assistants
at
cuyaba
lieutenant
caetano
thereby
securing
a
minutely
accurate
comparison
of
time
the
and
surveying
and
cartographical
work
generally
were
to
be
made
under
the
supervision
of
colonel
rondon
by
lyra
with
assistance
from
fiala
and
kermit
captain
amilcar
handled
the
worst
problem
transportation
the
medical
member
was
doctor
cajazeira
at
night
around
the
my
brazilian
companions
often
spoke
of
the
first
explorers
of
this
vast
wilderness
of
western
brazil
men
whose
very
names
are
now
hardly
known
but
who
did
each
his
part
in
opening
the
country
which
will
some
day
see
such
growth
and
development
among
the
most
notable
of
them
was
a
portuguese
ricardo
franco
who
spent
forty
years
at
the
work
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
opening
years
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
he
ascended
for
long
distances
the
xingu
and
the
tapajos
and
went
up
the
madeira
and
guapore
crossing
to
the
of
the
paraguay
and
partially
exploring
there
also
he
worked
among
and
with
the
indians
much
as
mungo
park
worked
with
the
natives
of
west
africa
having
none
of
the
aids
instruments
and
comforts
with
which
even
the
hardiest
of
modern
explorers
are
provided
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
established
the
beginnings
of
the
province
of
matto
grosso
for
many
years
the
sole
method
of
communication
between
this
remote
interior
province
and
civilization
was
by
the
long
difficult
and
perilous
route
which
led
up
the
amazon
and
madeira
and
its
then
capital
the
town
of
matto
grosso
the
seat
of
the
with
its
palace
cathedral
and
fortress
was
accordingly
placed
far
to
the
west
near
the
guapore
when
less
circuitous
lines
of
communication
were
established
farther
eastward
the
old
capital
was
abandoned
and
the
tropic
wilderness
surged
over
the
lonely
little
town
the
tomb
of
the
old
colonial
explorer
still
stands
in
the
ruined
cathedral
where
the
forest
has
once
more
come
to
its
own
but
civilization
is
again
advancing
to
reclaim
the
lost
town
and
to
revive
the
memory
of
the
wilderness
wanderer
who
helped
to
found
it
colonel
rondon
has
named
a
river
after
franco
a
range
of
mountains
has
also
been
named
after
him
and
the
colonel
acting
for
the
brazilian
government
has
established
a
telegraph
station
in
what
was
once
the
palace
of
the
our
northward
trail
led
along
the
high
ground
a
league
or
two
to
the
east
of
the
rio
sacre
each
night
we
camped
on
one
of
the
small
tributary
brooks
that
fed
it
fiala
kermit
and
i
occupied
one
tent
in
the
daytime
the
pium
flies
vicious
little
became
bad
enough
to
make
us
finally
use
gloves
and
nets
there
were
many
heavy
rains
which
made
the
travelling
hard
for
the
mules
the
soil
was
more
often
clay
than
sand
and
it
was
slippery
when
wet
the
weather
was
overcast
and
there
was
usually
no
oppressive
heat
even
at
noon
at
intervals
along
the
trail
we
came
on
the
staring
skull
and
bleached
skeleton
of
a
mule
or
ox
day
after
day
we
rode
forward
across
endless
flats
of
grass
and
of
low
open
scrubby
forest
the
trees
standing
far
apart
and
in
most
places
being
but
little
higher
than
the
head
of
a
horseman
some
of
them
carried
blossoms
white
orange
yellow
pink
and
there
were
many
flowers
the
most
beautiful
being
the
among
the
trees
were
bastard
and
dwarf
palmetto
if
the
latter
grew
more
than
a
few
feet
high
their
tops
were
torn
and
dishevelled
by
the
wind
there
was
very
little
bird
or
mammal
life
there
were
few
long
vistas
for
in
most
places
it
was
not
possible
to
see
far
among
the
gray
gnarled
trunks
of
the
little
trees
yet
the
desolate
landscape
had
a
certain
charm
of
its
own
although
not
a
charm
that
would
be
felt
by
any
man
who
does
not
take
pleasure
in
mere
space
and
freedom
and
wildness
and
in
plains
standing
empty
to
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
rain
the
country
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
country
west
of
redjaf
on
the
white
nile
the
home
of
the
giant
eland
only
here
there
was
no
big
game
no
chance
of
seeing
the
towering
form
of
the
giraffe
the
black
bulk
of
elephant
or
buffalo
the
herds
of
hartebeests
or
the
ghostly
shimmer
of
the
sun
glinting
on
the
coats
of
roan
and
eland
as
they
vanished
silently
in
the
gray
sea
of
withered
scrub
one
feature
in
common
with
the
african
landscape
was
the
abundance
of
some
as
high
as
a
man
they
were
red
in
the
clay
country
gray
where
it
was
sandy
and
the
dirt
houses
were
also
in
trees
while
their
raised
tunnels
traversed
trees
and
ground
alike
at
some
of
the
we
had
to
be
on
our
watch
against
the
swarms
of
carrying
ants
these
are
so
called
in
the
books
the
brazilians
call
them
carregadores
or
porters
because
they
are
always
carrying
bits
of
leaves
and
blades
of
grass
to
their
underground
homes
they
are
inveterate
and
they
industriously
cut
into
pieces
and
carry
off
any
garment
they
can
get
at
and
we
had
to
guard
our
shoes
and
clothes
from
them
just
as
we
had
often
had
to
guard
all
our
belongings
against
the
termites
these
ants
did
not
bite
us
but
we
encountered
huge
black
ants
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
which
were
very
vicious
and
their
bite
was
not
only
painful
but
quite
poisonous
were
common
and
one
evening
at
supper
one
had
a
comical
encounter
with
a
young
dog
a
jovial
of
colonel
rondon
named
cartucho
he
had
been
christened
the
from
a
character
in
one
of
frank
stockton
stories
which
i
suppose
are
now
remembered
only
by
elderly
people
and
by
them
only
if
they
are
natives
of
the
united
states
cartucho
was
lying
with
his
head
on
the
that
served
as
table
waiting
with
poorly
dissembled
impatience
for
his
share
of
the
banquet
the
mantis
flew
down
on
the
and
proceeded
to
crawl
over
it
taking
little
flights
from
one
corner
to
another
and
whenever
it
thought
itself
menaced
it
assumed
an
attitude
of
seeming
devotion
and
real
defiance
soon
it
lit
in
front
of
cartucho
nose
cartucho
cocked
his
big
ears
forward
stretched
his
neck
and
cautiously
sniffed
at
the
new
arrival
not
with
any
hostile
design
but
merely
to
find
out
whether
it
would
prove
to
be
a
playmate
the
mantis
promptly
assumed
an
attitude
of
prayer
this
struck
cartucho
as
both
novel
and
interesting
and
he
thrust
his
sniffing
black
nose
still
nearer
the
mantis
dexterously
thrust
forward
first
one
and
then
the
other
armed
fore
leg
touching
the
intrusive
nose
which
was
instantly
jerked
back
and
again
slowly
and
inquiringly
brought
forward
then
the
mantis
suddenly
flew
in
cartucho
face
whereupon
cartucho
with
a
smothered
yelp
of
dismay
almost
turned
a
back
somersault
and
the
triumphant
mantis
flew
back
to
the
middle
of
the
among
the
plates
where
it
reared
erect
and
defied
the
laughing
and
applauding
company
on
the
morning
of
the
we
were
rather
late
in
starting
because
the
rain
had
continued
through
the
night
into
the
morning
drenching
everything
after
nightfall
there
had
been
some
mosquitoes
and
the
piums
were
a
pest
during
daylight
where
one
bites
it
leaves
a
tiny
black
spot
on
the
skin
which
lasts
for
several
weeks
in
the
slippery
mud
one
of
the
fell
and
injured
itself
so
that
it
had
to
be
abandoned
soon
after
starting
we
came
on
the
which
runs
from
cuyaba
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
seen
it
two
parecis
indians
joined
us
leading
a
they
were
dressed
in
hat
shirt
trousers
and
sandals
precisely
like
the
ordinary
brazilian
caboclos
as
the
poor
backwoods
peasants
usually
with
little
white
blood
in
them
are
colloquially
and
styled
caboclo
being
originally
a
guarany
word
meaning
naked
savage
these
two
indians
were
in
the
employ
of
the
telegraphic
commission
and
had
been
patrolling
the
the
bullock
carried
their
personal
belongings
and
the
tools
with
which
they
could
repair
a
break
the
commission
pays
the
ordinary
indian
worker
cents
a
day
a
very
good
worker
gets
and
the
chief
no
man
gets
anything
unless
he
works
colonel
rondon
by
just
kindly
and
understanding
treatment
of
these
indians
who
previously
had
often
been
exploited
and
maltreated
by
has
made
them
the
loyal
friends
of
the
government
he
has
gathered
them
at
the
telegraph
stations
where
they
cultivate
fields
of
mandioc
beans
potatoes
maize
and
other
vegetables
and
where
he
is
introducing
them
to
and
the
entire
work
of
guarding
and
patrolling
the
line
is
theirs
after
six
hours
march
we
came
to
the
crossing
of
the
rio
sacre
at
the
beautiful
waterfall
appropriately
called
the
salto
bello
this
is
the
end
of
the
automobile
road
here
there
is
a
small
parecis
village
the
men
of
the
village
work
the
ferry
by
which
everything
is
taken
across
the
deep
and
rapid
river
the
is
made
of
planking
placed
on
three
dugout
canoes
and
runs
on
a
trolley
before
crossing
we
enjoyed
a
good
swim
in
the
swift
clear
cool
water
the
indian
village
where
we
camped
is
placed
on
a
jutting
tongue
of
land
round
which
the
river
sweeps
just
before
it
leaps
from
the
precipice
the
falls
themselves
are
very
lovely
just
above
them
is
a
wooded
island
but
the
river
joins
again
before
it
races
forward
for
the
final
plunge
there
is
a
sheer
drop
of
forty
or
fifty
yards
with
a
breadth
two
or
three
times
as
great
and
the
volume
of
water
is
large
on
the
left
or
hither
bank
a
cliff
extends
for
several
hundred
yards
below
the
falls
green
vines
have
flung
themselves
down
over
its
face
and
they
are
met
by
other
vines
thrusting
upward
from
the
mass
of
vegetation
at
its
foot
glistening
in
the
perpetual
mist
from
the
cataract
and
clothing
even
the
rock
surfaces
in
vivid
green
the
river
after
throwing
itself
over
the
rock
wall
rushes
off
in
long
curves
at
the
bottom
of
a
thickly
wooded
ravine
the
white
water
churning
among
the
black
boulders
there
is
a
perpetual
rainbow
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
the
masses
of
green
water
that
are
hurling
themselves
over
the
brink
dissolve
into
shifting
foaming
columns
of
snowy
lace
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
below
the
falls
colonel
rondon
had
placed
benches
giving
a
curious
touch
of
rather
conventional
civilization
to
this
cataract
far
out
in
the
lonely
wilderness
it
is
well
worth
visiting
for
its
beauty
it
is
also
of
extreme
interest
because
of
the
promise
it
holds
for
the
future
lieutenant
lyra
informed
me
that
they
had
calculated
that
this
fall
would
furnish
thousand
eight
miles
off
we
were
to
see
another
fall
of
much
greater
height
and
power
there
are
many
rivers
in
this
region
which
would
furnish
almost
unlimited
motive
force
to
populous
manufacturing
communities
the
country
round
about
is
healthy
it
is
an
upland
region
of
good
climate
we
were
visiting
it
in
the
rainy
season
the
season
when
the
nights
are
far
less
cool
than
in
the
dry
season
and
yet
we
found
it
delightful
there
is
much
fertile
soil
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
streams
and
the
teeming
lowlands
of
the
amazon
and
the
paraguay
could
readily
and
with
immense
advantage
to
both
sides
be
made
tributary
to
an
industrial
civilization
seated
on
these
highlands
a
has
been
built
to
and
across
them
a
should
follow
such
a
line
could
be
easily
built
for
there
are
no
serious
natural
obstacles
in
advance
of
its
construction
a
could
be
run
from
cuyaba
to
the
falls
using
the
power
furnished
by
the
latter
once
this
is
done
the
land
will
offer
extraordinary
opportunities
to
settlers
of
the
right
kind
to
and
to
enterprising
business
men
of
foresight
coolness
and
sagacity
who
are
willing
to
work
with
the
settlers
the
immigrants
the
for
an
advantage
which
shall
be
mutual
the
parecis
indians
whom
we
met
here
were
exceedingly
interesting
they
were
to
all
appearance
an
unusually
cheerful
people
their
teeth
were
bad
otherwise
they
appeared
strong
and
vigorous
and
there
were
plenty
of
children
the
colonel
was
received
as
a
valued
friend
and
as
a
leader
who
was
to
be
followed
and
obeyed
he
is
raising
them
by
degrees
the
only
way
by
which
to
make
the
rise
permanent
in
this
village
he
has
got
them
to
substitute
for
the
flimsy
indian
cabins
houses
of
the
type
usual
among
the
poorer
field
laborers
and
dwellers
in
brazil
these
houses
have
roofs
of
palm
thatch
steeply
pitched
they
are
usually
open
at
the
sides
consisting
merely
of
a
framework
of
timbers
with
a
wall
at
the
back
but
some
have
the
ordinary
four
walls
of
erect
the
hammocks
are
slung
in
the
houses
and
the
cooking
is
also
done
in
them
with
pots
placed
on
small
open
fires
or
occasionally
in
a
kind
of
clay
oven
the
big
gourds
for
water
and
the
wicker
baskets
are
placed
on
the
ground
or
hung
on
the
poles
the
men
had
adopted
and
were
wearing
shirts
and
trousers
but
the
women
had
made
little
change
in
their
clothing
a
few
wore
print
dresses
but
obviously
only
for
ornament
most
of
them
especially
the
girls
and
young
married
women
wore
nothing
but
a
in
addition
to
bead
necklaces
and
bracelets
the
nursing
mothers
and
almost
all
the
mothers
were
nursing
sometimes
carried
the
child
slung
against
their
side
of
hip
seated
in
a
cloth
belt
or
sling
which
went
over
the
opposite
shoulder
of
the
mother
the
women
seemed
to
be
well
treated
although
polygamy
is
practised
the
children
were
loved
by
every
one
they
were
petted
by
both
men
and
women
and
they
behaved
well
to
one
another
the
boys
not
seeming
to
bully
the
girls
or
the
smaller
boys
most
of
the
children
were
naked
but
the
girls
early
wore
the
and
some
both
of
the
little
boys
and
the
little
girls
wore
colored
print
garments
to
the
evident
pride
of
themselves
and
their
parents
in
each
house
there
were
several
families
and
life
went
on
with
no
privacy
but
with
good
humor
consideration
and
fundamentally
good
manners
the
man
or
woman
who
had
nothing
to
do
lay
in
a
hammock
or
squatted
on
the
ground
leaning
against
a
post
or
wall
the
children
played
together
or
lay
in
little
hammocks
or
tagged
round
after
their
mothers
and
when
called
they
came
trustfully
up
to
us
to
be
petted
or
given
some
small
trinket
they
were
friendly
little
souls
and
accustomed
to
good
treatment
one
woman
was
weaving
a
cloth
another
was
making
a
hammock
others
made
ready
melons
and
other
vegetables
and
cooked
them
over
tiny
fires
the
men
who
had
come
in
from
work
at
the
ferry
or
along
the
did
some
work
themselves
or
played
with
the
children
one
cut
a
small
hair
and
then
had
his
own
hair
cut
by
a
friend
but
the
absorbing
amusement
of
the
men
was
an
extraordinary
game
of
ball
in
our
family
we
have
always
relished
oliver
herford
nonsense
rhymes
including
the
account
of
willie
displeasure
with
his
goat
i
do
not
like
my
billy
goat
i
wish
that
he
was
dead
because
he
kicked
me
so
he
did
he
kicked
me
with
his
head
well
these
parecis
indians
enthusiastically
play
football
with
their
heads
the
game
is
not
only
native
to
them
but
i
have
never
heard
or
read
of
its
being
played
by
any
other
tribe
or
people
they
use
a
light
hollow
rubber
ball
of
their
own
manufacture
it
is
circular
and
about
eight
inches
in
diameter
the
players
are
divided
into
two
sides
and
stationed
much
as
in
association
football
and
the
ball
is
placed
on
the
ground
to
be
put
in
play
as
in
football
then
a
player
runs
forward
throws
himself
flat
on
the
ground
and
butts
the
ball
toward
the
opposite
side
this
first
butt
when
the
ball
is
on
the
ground
never
lifts
it
much
and
it
rolls
and
bounds
toward
the
opponents
one
or
two
of
the
latter
run
toward
it
one
throws
himself
flat
on
his
face
and
butts
the
ball
back
usually
this
butt
lifts
it
and
it
flies
back
in
a
curve
well
up
in
the
air
and
an
opposite
player
rushing
toward
it
catches
it
on
his
head
with
such
a
swing
of
his
brawny
neck
and
such
precision
and
address
that
the
ball
bounds
back
through
the
air
as
a
football
soars
after
a
if
the
ball
flies
off
to
one
side
or
the
other
it
is
brought
back
and
again
put
in
play
often
it
will
be
sent
to
and
fro
a
dozen
times
from
head
to
head
until
finally
it
rises
with
such
a
sweep
that
it
passes
far
over
the
heads
of
the
opposite
players
and
descends
behind
them
then
shrill
rolling
cries
of
triumph
arise
from
the
victors
and
the
game
instantly
begins
again
with
fresh
zest
there
are
of
course
no
such
rules
as
in
a
specialized
of
civilization
and
i
saw
no
disputes
there
may
be
eight
or
ten
or
many
more
players
on
each
side
the
ball
is
never
touched
with
the
hands
or
feet
or
with
anything
except
the
top
of
the
head
it
is
hard
to
decide
whether
to
wonder
most
at
the
dexterity
and
strength
with
which
it
is
hit
or
butted
with
the
head
as
it
comes
down
through
the
air
or
at
the
reckless
speed
and
skill
with
which
the
players
throw
themselves
headlong
on
the
ground
to
return
the
ball
if
it
comes
low
down
why
they
do
not
grind
off
their
noses
i
can
not
imagine
some
of
the
players
hardly
ever
failed
to
catch
and
return
the
ball
if
it
came
in
their
neighborhood
and
with
such
a
vigorous
toss
of
the
head
that
it
often
flew
in
a
great
curve
for
a
really
astonishing
distance
that
night
a
got
into
the
tent
in
which
kermit
and
i
were
sleeping
entering
first
at
one
end
and
then
at
the
other
it
is
extraordinary
that
he
did
not
waken
us
but
we
slept
undisturbed
while
the
ox
deliberately
ate
our
shirts
socks
and
underclothes
it
chewed
them
into
rags
one
of
my
socks
escaped
and
my
undershirt
although
chewed
full
of
holes
was
still
good
for
some
weeks
wear
but
the
other
things
were
in
fragments
in
the
morning
colonel
rondon
arranged
for
us
to
have
breakfast
over
on
the
benches
under
the
trees
by
the
waterfall
whose
roar
lulled
to
a
thunderous
murmur
had
been
in
our
ears
before
we
slept
and
when
we
waked
there
could
have
been
no
more
picturesque
place
for
the
breakfast
of
such
a
party
as
ours
all
travellers
who
really
care
to
see
what
is
most
beautiful
and
most
characteristic
of
the
far
interior
of
south
america
should
in
their
journey
visit
this
region
and
see
the
two
great
waterfalls
they
are
even
now
easy
of
access
and
as
soon
as
the
traffic
warrants
it
they
will
be
made
still
more
so
then
from
sao
luis
caceres
they
will
be
speedily
reached
by
light
steamboat
up
the
sepotuba
and
by
a
day
or
two
automobile
ride
with
a
couple
of
days
on
in
between
the
colonel
held
a
very
serious
council
with
the
parecis
indians
over
an
incident
which
caused
him
grave
concern
one
of
the
employees
a
negro
had
killed
a
wild
nhambiquara
indian
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
really
been
urged
on
and
aided
by
the
parecis
as
the
members
of
the
tribe
to
which
the
dead
indian
belonged
were
much
given
to
carrying
off
the
parecis
women
and
in
other
ways
making
themselves
bad
neighbors
the
colonel
tried
hard
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
he
went
to
the
biggest
indian
house
where
he
sat
in
a
hammock
an
indian
child
cuddling
solemnly
up
to
him
by
the
way
while
the
indians
sat
in
other
hammocks
and
stood
round
about
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
an
absolutely
frank
statement
it
appeared
however
that
the
nhambiquaras
had
made
a
descent
on
the
parecis
village
in
the
momentary
absence
of
the
men
of
the
village
but
the
latter
notified
by
the
screaming
of
the
women
had
returned
in
time
to
rescue
them
the
negro
was
with
them
and
having
a
good
rifle
he
killed
one
of
the
aggressors
the
parecis
were
of
course
in
the
right
but
the
colonel
could
not
afford
to
have
his
men
take
sides
in
a
tribal
quarrel
it
was
only
a
two
hours
march
across
to
the
papagaio
at
the
falls
of
utiarity
so
named
by
their
discoverer
colonel
rondon
after
the
sacred
falcon
of
the
parecis
on
the
way
we
passed
our
indian
friends
themselves
bound
thither
both
the
men
and
the
women
bore
burdens
the
burdens
of
some
of
the
women
poor
things
were
heavy
and
even
the
small
naked
children
carried
the
live
hens
at
utiarity
there
is
a
big
parecis
settlement
and
a
telegraph
station
kept
by
one
of
the
employees
of
the
commission
his
pretty
brown
wife
is
acting
as
schoolmistress
to
a
group
of
little
parecis
girls
the
parecis
chief
has
been
made
a
major
and
wears
a
uniform
accordingly
the
commission
has
erected
good
buildings
for
its
own
employees
and
has
superintended
the
erection
of
good
houses
for
the
indians
most
of
the
latter
still
prefer
the
simplicity
of
the
in
their
ordinary
lives
but
they
proudly
wore
their
civilized
clothes
in
our
honor
when
in
the
late
afternoon
the
men
began
to
play
a
regular
match
game
of
ball
with
a
scorer
or
umpire
to
keep
count
they
soon
discarded
most
of
their
clothes
coming
down
to
nothing
but
trousers
or
a
two
or
three
of
them
had
their
faces
stained
with
red
ochre
among
the
women
and
children
looking
on
were
a
couple
of
little
girls
who
paraded
about
on
stilts
the
great
waterfall
was
half
a
mile
below
us
lovely
though
we
had
found
salto
bello
these
falls
were
far
superior
in
beauty
and
majesty
they
are
twice
as
high
and
twice
as
broad
and
the
lay
of
the
land
is
such
that
the
various
landscapes
in
which
the
waterfall
is
a
feature
are
more
striking
a
few
hundred
yards
above
the
falls
the
river
turns
at
an
angle
and
widens
the
broad
rapid
shallows
are
crested
with
whitecaps
beyond
this
wide
expanse
of
flecked
and
hurrying
water
rise
the
mist
columns
of
the
cataract
and
as
these
columns
are
swayed
and
broken
by
the
wind
the
forest
appears
through
and
between
them
from
below
the
view
is
one
of
singular
grandeur
the
fall
is
over
a
shelving
ledge
of
rock
which
goes
in
a
nearly
straight
line
across
the
river
course
but
at
the
left
there
is
a
salient
in
the
and
here
accordingly
a
great
cataract
of
foaming
water
comes
down
almost
as
a
separate
body
in
advance
of
the
line
of
the
main
fall
i
doubt
whether
excepting
of
course
niagara
there
is
a
waterfall
in
north
america
which
outranks
this
if
both
volume
and
beauty
are
considered
above
the
fall
the
river
flows
through
a
wide
valley
with
gently
sloping
sides
below
it
slips
along
a
torrent
of
water
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
gorge
and
the
sides
of
the
gorge
are
clothed
with
a
towering
growth
of
tropical
forest
next
morning
the
cacique
of
these
indians
in
his
major
uniform
came
to
breakfast
and
bore
himself
with
entire
propriety
it
was
raining
heavily
it
rained
most
of
the
time
and
a
few
minutes
previously
i
had
noticed
the
cacique
two
wives
with
three
or
four
other
young
women
going
out
to
the
mandioc
fields
it
was
a
picturesque
group
the
women
were
all
mothers
and
each
carried
a
nursing
child
they
wore
or
short
skirts
each
carried
on
her
back
a
wickerwork
basket
supported
by
a
which
went
around
her
forehead
each
carried
a
belt
slung
diagonally
across
her
body
over
her
right
shoulder
in
this
the
child
was
carried
against
and
perhaps
astride
of
her
left
hip
they
were
comely
women
who
did
not
look
jaded
or
cowed
and
they
laughed
cheerfully
and
nodded
to
us
as
they
passed
through
the
rain
on
their
way
to
the
fields
but
the
contrast
between
them
and
the
chief
in
his
soldier
uniform
seated
at
breakfast
was
rather
too
striking
and
incidentally
it
etched
in
bold
lines
the
folly
of
those
who
idealize
the
life
of
even
exceptionally
good
and
savages
although
it
was
the
rainy
season
the
trip
up
to
this
point
had
not
been
difficult
and
from
may
to
october
when
the
climate
is
dry
and
at
its
best
there
would
be
practically
no
hardship
at
all
for
travellers
and
visitors
this
is
a
healthy
plateau
but
of
course
the
men
who
do
the
first
pioneering
even
in
country
like
this
encounter
dangers
and
run
risks
and
they
make
payment
with
their
bodies
at
more
than
one
we
had
come
across
the
forlorn
grave
of
some
soldier
or
laborer
of
the
commission
the
lay
within
a
rude
stockade
and
an
uninscribed
wooden
cross
gray
and
marked
the
last
of
the
unknown
and
forgotten
man
beneath
the
man
who
had
paid
with
his
humble
life
the
cost
of
pushing
the
frontier
of
civilization
into
the
wild
savagery
of
the
wilderness
farther
west
the
conditions
become
less
healthy
at
this
station
colonel
rondon
received
news
of
sickness
and
of
some
deaths
among
the
employees
of
the
commission
in
the
country
to
the
westward
which
we
were
soon
to
enter
beriberi
and
malignant
malarial
fever
were
the
diseases
which
claimed
the
major
number
of
the
victims
surely
these
are
the
men
who
do
the
work
for
which
they
draw
the
wage
kermit
had
with
him
the
same
copy
of
kipling
poems
which
he
had
carried
through
africa
at
these
falls
there
was
one
sunset
of
angry
splendor
and
we
contrasted
this
going
down
of
the
sun
through
broken
and
over
leagues
of
wet
tropical
forest
with
the
desert
sunsets
we
had
seen
in
arizona
and
sonora
and
along
the
guaso
nyiro
north
and
west
of
mount
kenia
when
the
barren
mountains
were
changed
into
flaming
ramparts
of
slaughter
and
peril
standing
above
the
flats
below
it
rained
during
most
of
the
day
after
our
arrival
at
utiarity
whenever
there
was
any
the
men
promptly
came
forth
from
their
houses
and
played
with
the
utmost
vigor
and
we
would
listen
to
their
shrill
undulating
cries
of
applause
and
triumph
until
we
also
grew
interested
and
strolled
over
to
look
on
they
are
more
infatuated
with
the
game
than
an
american
boy
is
with
baseball
or
football
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
that
this
strange
and
exciting
game
should
be
played
by
and
only
by
one
little
tribe
of
indians
in
what
is
almost
the
very
centre
of
south
america
if
any
traveller
or
ethnologist
knows
of
a
tribe
elsewhere
that
plays
a
similar
game
i
wish
he
would
let
me
know
to
play
it
demands
great
activity
vigor
skill
and
endurance
looking
at
the
strong
supple
bodies
of
the
players
and
at
the
number
of
children
roundabout
it
seemed
as
if
the
tribe
must
be
in
vigorous
health
yet
the
parecis
have
decreased
in
numbers
for
measles
and
smallpox
have
been
fatal
to
them
by
the
evening
the
rain
was
coming
down
more
heavily
than
ever
it
was
not
possible
to
keep
the
moisture
out
of
our
belongings
everything
became
mouldy
except
what
became
rusty
it
rained
all
that
night
and
saw
the
downpour
continuing
with
no
prospect
of
cessation
the
could
not
have
gone
on
with
the
march
they
were
already
rather
done
up
by
their
previous
ten
days
labor
through
rain
and
mud
and
it
seemed
advisable
to
wait
until
the
weather
became
better
before
attempting
to
go
forward
moreover
there
had
been
no
chance
to
take
the
desired
astronomical
observations
there
was
very
little
grass
for
the
mules
but
there
was
abundance
of
a
plant
eight
or
ten
inches
high
unfortunately
not
very
nourishing
on
which
they
fed
greedily
in
such
weather
and
over
such
muddy
trails
oxen
travel
better
than
mules
in
spite
of
the
weather
cherrie
and
miller
whom
together
with
father
zahm
and
sigg
we
had
found
awaiting
us
made
good
collections
of
birds
and
mammals
among
the
latter
were
opossums
and
mice
that
were
new
to
them
the
birds
included
various
forms
so
unlike
our
home
birds
that
the
enumeration
of
their
names
would
mean
nothing
one
of
the
most
interesting
was
a
large
woodpecker
the
white
predominating
in
the
plumage
several
of
these
woodpeckers
were
usually
found
together
they
were
showy
noisy
and
restless
and
perched
on
twigs
in
ordinary
bird
fashion
at
least
as
often
as
they
clung
to
the
trunks
in
orthodox
woodpecker
style
the
prettiest
bird
was
a
tiny
manakin
with
a
head
on
february
the
rain
let
up
although
the
sky
remained
overcast
and
there
were
occasional
showers
i
walked
off
with
my
rifle
for
a
couple
of
leagues
at
that
distance
from
a
slight
hillock
the
mist
columns
of
the
falls
were
conspicuous
in
the
landscape
the
only
mammal
i
saw
on
the
walk
was
a
rather
hairy
armadillo
with
a
flexible
tail
which
i
picked
up
and
brought
back
to
miller
it
showed
none
of
the
speed
of
the
armadillos
we
met
on
our
judging
by
its
actions
as
it
trotted
about
before
it
saw
me
it
must
be
diurnal
in
habits
it
was
new
to
the
collection
i
spent
much
of
the
afternoon
by
the
waterfall
under
the
overcast
sky
the
great
cataract
lost
the
deep
green
and
of
the
sunlit
falling
waters
instead
it
showed
opaline
hues
and
tints
of
topaz
and
amethyst
at
all
times
and
under
all
lights
it
was
majestic
and
beautiful
colonel
rondon
had
given
the
indians
various
presents
those
for
the
women
including
calico
prints
and
what
they
especially
prized
bottles
of
scented
oil
from
paris
for
their
hair
the
men
held
a
dance
in
the
late
afternoon
for
this
occasion
most
but
not
all
of
them
cast
aside
their
civilized
clothing
and
appeared
as
doubtless
they
would
all
have
appeared
had
none
but
themselves
been
present
they
were
absolutely
naked
except
for
a
beaded
string
round
the
waist
most
of
them
were
spotted
and
dashed
with
red
paint
and
on
one
leg
wore
anklets
which
rattled
a
number
carried
pipes
through
which
they
blew
a
kind
of
deep
stifled
whistle
in
time
to
the
dancing
one
of
them
had
his
pipe
leading
into
a
huge
gourd
which
gave
out
a
hollow
moaning
boom
many
wore
two
red
or
green
or
yellow
macaw
feathers
in
their
hair
and
one
had
a
macaw
feather
stuck
transversely
through
the
septum
of
his
nose
they
circled
slowly
round
and
round
chanting
and
stamping
their
feet
while
the
anklet
rattles
clattered
and
the
pipes
droned
they
advanced
to
the
wall
of
one
of
the
houses
again
and
again
chanting
and
bowing
before
it
i
was
told
this
was
a
demand
for
drink
they
entered
one
house
and
danced
in
a
ring
around
the
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
earth
floor
i
was
told
that
they
were
then
reciting
the
deeds
of
mighty
hunters
and
describing
how
they
brought
in
the
game
they
drank
freely
from
gourds
and
pannikins
of
a
fermented
drink
made
from
mandioc
which
were
brought
out
to
them
during
the
first
part
of
the
dance
the
women
remained
in
the
houses
and
all
the
doors
and
windows
were
shut
and
blankets
hung
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
seeing
out
but
during
the
second
part
all
the
women
and
girls
came
out
and
looked
on
they
were
themselves
to
have
danced
when
the
men
had
finished
but
were
overcome
with
shyness
at
the
thought
of
dancing
with
so
many
strangers
looking
on
the
children
played
about
with
unconcern
throughout
the
ceremony
one
of
them
throwing
high
in
the
air
and
again
catching
in
his
hands
a
loaded
feather
a
kind
of
shuttlecock
in
the
evening
the
growing
moon
shone
through
the
anything
approaching
fair
weather
always
put
our
men
in
good
spirits
and
the
muleteers
squatted
in
a
circle
by
a
fire
near
a
pile
of
packs
and
listened
to
a
long
monotonously
and
rather
mournfully
chanted
song
about
a
dance
and
a
we
ourselves
worked
busily
with
our
photographs
and
our
writing
there
was
so
much
humidity
in
the
air
that
everything
grew
damp
and
stayed
damp
and
mould
gathered
quickly
at
this
season
it
is
a
country
in
which
writing
taking
photographs
and
preparing
specimens
are
all
works
of
difficulty
at
least
so
far
as
concerns
preserving
and
sending
home
the
results
of
the
labor
and
a
man
clothing
is
never
really
dry
from
here
father
zahm
returned
to
tapirapoan
accompanied
by
sigg
vii
with
a
mule
train
across
nhambiquara
land
from
this
point
we
were
to
enter
a
still
wilder
region
the
land
of
the
naked
nhambiquaras
on
february
the
weather
cleared
and
we
started
with
the
and
two
fiala
and
lieutenant
lauriado
stayed
at
utiarity
to
take
canoes
and
go
down
the
papagaio
which
had
not
been
descended
by
any
scientific
party
and
perhaps
by
no
one
they
were
then
to
descend
the
juruena
and
tapajos
thereby
performing
a
necessary
part
of
the
work
of
the
expedition
our
remaining
party
consisted
of
colonel
rondon
lieutenant
lyra
the
doctor
oliveira
cherrie
miller
kermit
and
myself
on
the
juruena
we
expected
to
meet
the
pack
with
captain
amilcar
and
lieutenant
mello
the
other
brazilian
members
of
the
party
had
returned
we
had
now
begun
the
difficult
part
of
the
expedition
the
pium
flies
were
becoming
a
pest
there
was
much
fever
and
beriberi
in
the
country
we
were
entering
the
feed
for
the
animals
was
poor
the
rains
had
made
the
trails
slippery
and
difficult
and
many
both
of
the
mules
and
the
oxen
were
already
weak
and
some
had
to
be
abandoned
we
left
the
canoe
the
motor
and
the
gasolene
we
had
hoped
to
try
them
on
the
amazonian
rivers
but
we
were
obliged
to
cut
down
everything
that
was
not
absolutely
indispensable
before
leaving
we
prepared
for
shipment
back
to
the
museum
some
of
the
bigger
skins
and
also
some
of
the
weapons
and
utensils
of
the
indians
which
kermit
had
collected
these
included
woven
fillets
and
fillets
made
of
macaw
feathers
for
use
in
the
dances
woven
belts
a
gourd
in
which
the
sacred
drink
is
offered
to
the
god
enoerey
wickerwork
baskets
flutes
or
pipes
anklet
rattles
hammocks
a
belt
of
the
kind
used
by
the
women
in
carrying
the
babies
with
the
all
these
were
parecis
articles
he
also
secured
from
the
nhambiquaras
wickerwork
baskets
of
a
different
type
and
bows
and
arrows
the
bows
were
seven
feet
long
and
the
arrows
five
feet
there
were
arrows
for
birds
arrows
with
long
sharp
wooden
blades
for
tapir
deer
and
other
mammals
and
the
poisoned
arrows
with
sharp
barbs
and
bound
on
by
fine
thongs
and
with
a
long
hollow
wooden
guard
to
slip
over
the
entire
point
and
protect
it
until
the
time
came
to
use
it
when
people
talk
glibly
of
idle
savages
they
ignore
the
immense
labor
entailed
by
many
of
their
industries
and
the
really
extraordinary
amount
of
work
they
accomplish
by
the
skilful
use
of
their
primitive
and
ineffective
tools
it
was
not
until
early
in
the
afternoon
that
we
started
into
the
sertao
as
brazilians
call
the
wilderness
we
drove
with
us
a
herd
of
oxen
for
food
after
going
about
fifteen
miles
we
camped
beside
the
swampy
headwaters
of
a
little
brook
it
was
at
the
spot
where
nearly
seven
years
previously
rondon
and
lyra
had
camped
on
the
trip
when
they
discovered
utiarity
falls
and
penetrated
to
the
juruena
when
they
reached
this
place
they
had
been
hours
without
food
they
killed
a
bush
deer
a
small
deer
and
ate
literally
every
particle
the
dogs
devoured
the
entire
skin
for
much
of
the
time
on
this
trip
they
lived
on
wild
fruit
and
the
two
dogs
that
remained
alive
would
wait
eagerly
under
the
trees
and
eat
the
fruit
that
was
shaken
down
pronounced
sairtown
as
nearly
as
with
our
preposterous
methods
of
spelling
and
pronunciation
i
can
render
it
in
the
late
afternoon
the
piums
were
rather
bad
at
this
camp
but
we
had
gloves
and
and
were
not
bothered
and
although
there
were
some
mosquitoes
we
slept
well
under
our
the
frogs
in
the
swamp
uttered
a
peculiar
loud
shout
miller
told
of
a
little
in
colombia
which
swelled
itself
out
with
air
until
it
looked
like
the
frog
in
aesop
fables
and
then
brayed
like
a
mule
and
cherrie
told
of
a
huge
frog
in
guiana
that
uttered
a
short
loud
roar
next
day
the
weather
was
still
fair
our
march
lay
through
country
like
that
which
we
had
been
traversing
for
ten
days
skeletons
of
mules
and
oxen
were
more
frequent
and
once
or
twice
by
the
wayside
we
passed
the
graves
of
officers
or
men
who
had
died
on
the
road
barbed
wire
encircled
the
desolate
little
mounds
we
camped
on
the
west
bank
of
the
burity
river
here
there
is
a
balsa
or
ferry
run
by
two
parecis
indians
as
employees
of
the
telegraphic
commission
under
the
colonel
each
had
a
thatched
house
and
each
had
two
wives
all
these
indians
are
pagans
all
were
dressed
much
like
the
poorer
peasants
of
the
brazilian
back
country
and
all
were
pleasant
and
the
women
ran
the
ferry
about
as
well
as
the
men
they
had
no
cultivated
fields
and
for
weeks
they
had
been
living
only
on
game
and
honey
and
they
hailed
with
joy
our
advent
and
the
quantities
of
beans
and
rice
which
together
with
some
beef
the
colonel
left
with
them
they
feasted
most
of
the
night
their
houses
contained
their
hammocks
baskets
and
other
belongings
and
they
owned
some
poultry
in
one
house
was
a
tiny
parakeet
very
much
at
home
and
familiar
but
by
no
means
friendly
with
strangers
there
are
wild
nhambiquaras
in
the
neighborhood
and
recently
several
of
these
had
menaced
the
two
ferrymen
with
an
attack
even
shooting
arrows
at
them
the
ferrymen
had
driven
them
off
by
firing
their
rifles
in
the
air
and
they
expected
and
received
the
colonel
praise
for
their
for
the
colonel
is
doing
all
he
can
to
persuade
the
indians
to
stop
their
blood
feuds
the
rifles
were
short
and
light
winchester
carbines
of
the
kind
so
universally
used
by
the
and
other
adventurous
wanderers
in
the
forest
wilderness
of
brazil
there
were
a
number
of
in
the
neighborhood
by
the
way
we
enjoyed
a
good
bath
in
the
burity
although
it
was
impossible
to
make
headway
by
swimming
against
the
racing
current
there
were
few
mosquitoes
on
the
other
hand
various
kinds
of
piums
were
a
little
too
abundant
they
vary
from
things
like
small
gnats
to
things
like
black
flies
the
small
stingless
bees
have
no
fear
and
can
hardly
be
frightened
away
when
they
light
on
the
hands
or
face
but
they
never
bite
and
merely
cause
a
slight
tickling
as
they
crawl
over
the
skin
there
were
some
big
bees
however
which
although
they
crawled
about
harmlessly
after
lighting
if
they
were
undisturbed
yet
stung
fiercely
if
they
were
molested
the
insects
were
not
ordinarily
a
serious
bother
but
there
were
occasional
hours
when
they
were
too
numerous
for
comfort
and
now
and
then
i
had
to
do
my
writing
in
a
and
gauntlets
the
night
we
reached
the
burity
it
rained
heavily
and
next
day
the
rain
continued
in
the
morning
the
mules
were
ferried
over
while
the
oxen
were
swum
across
half
a
dozen
of
our
men
whites
indians
and
negroes
all
stark
naked
and
uttering
wild
cries
drove
the
oxen
into
the
river
and
then
with
powerful
overhand
strokes
swam
behind
and
alongside
them
as
they
crossed
half
breasting
the
swift
current
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
the
big
staring
beasts
swimming
strongly
while
the
sinewy
naked
men
urged
them
forward
utterly
at
ease
in
the
rushing
water
we
made
only
a
short
day
journey
for
owing
to
the
lack
of
grass
the
mules
had
to
be
driven
off
nearly
three
miles
from
our
line
of
march
in
order
to
get
them
feed
we
camped
at
the
headwaters
of
a
little
brook
called
huatsui
which
is
parecis
for
monkey
accompanying
us
on
this
march
was
a
soldier
bound
for
one
of
the
remoter
posts
with
him
trudged
his
wife
they
made
the
whole
journey
on
foot
there
were
two
children
one
was
so
young
that
it
had
to
be
carried
alternately
by
the
father
and
mother
the
other
a
small
boy
of
eight
and
much
the
best
of
the
party
was
already
a
competent
wilderness
worker
he
bore
his
share
of
the
belongings
on
the
march
and
when
camp
was
reached
sometimes
himself
put
up
the
family
shelter
they
were
mainly
of
negro
blood
struck
by
the
woman
uncomplaining
endurance
of
fatigue
we
offered
to
take
her
and
the
baby
in
the
automobile
while
it
accompanied
us
but
alas
this
proved
to
be
one
of
those
melancholy
cases
where
the
effort
to
relieve
hardship
well
endured
results
only
in
showing
that
those
who
endure
the
adversity
can
not
stand
even
a
slight
prosperity
the
woman
proved
a
querulous
traveller
in
the
auto
complaining
that
she
was
not
made
as
comfortable
as
apparently
she
had
expected
and
after
one
day
the
husband
declared
he
was
not
willing
to
have
her
go
unless
he
went
too
and
the
family
resumed
their
walk
in
this
neighborhood
there
were
multitudes
of
the
big
gregarious
crepuscular
or
nocturnal
spiders
which
i
have
before
mentioned
on
arriving
in
camp
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
i
ran
into
a
number
of
remains
of
their
webs
and
saw
a
very
few
of
the
spiders
themselves
sitting
in
the
webs
midway
between
trees
i
then
strolled
a
couple
of
miles
up
the
road
ahead
of
us
under
the
line
of
it
was
still
bright
sunlight
and
no
spiders
were
out
in
fact
i
did
not
suspect
their
presence
along
the
line
of
although
i
ought
to
have
done
so
for
i
continually
ran
into
long
strings
of
tough
fine
web
which
got
across
my
face
or
hands
or
rifle
barrel
i
returned
just
at
sunset
and
the
spiders
were
out
in
force
i
saw
dozens
of
colonies
each
of
scores
or
hundreds
of
individuals
many
were
among
the
small
trees
alongside
the
broad
cleared
trail
but
most
were
dependent
from
the
wire
itself
their
webs
had
all
been
made
or
repaired
since
i
had
passed
each
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
his
own
wheel
and
all
the
wheels
were
joined
to
one
another
and
the
whole
pendent
fabric
hung
by
fine
ropes
from
the
wire
above
and
was
in
some
cases
steadied
by
thrown
thirty
feet
off
to
little
trees
alongside
i
watched
them
until
nightfall
and
evidently
to
them
after
their
day
rest
their
day
work
had
just
begun
next
morning
owing
to
a
desire
to
find
out
what
the
facts
were
as
regards
the
which
were
in
difficulties
cherrie
miller
kermit
and
i
walked
back
to
the
burity
river
where
colonel
rondon
had
spent
the
night
it
was
a
misty
overcast
morning
and
the
spiders
in
the
webs
that
hung
from
the
were
just
going
to
their
day
homes
these
were
in
and
under
the
big
white
china
insulators
on
the
hundreds
of
spiders
were
already
climbing
up
into
these
when
two
or
three
hours
later
we
returned
the
sun
was
out
and
not
a
spider
was
to
be
seen
here
we
had
to
cut
down
our
baggage
and
rearrange
the
loads
for
the
cherrie
and
miller
had
a
most
workmanlike
equipment
including
a
very
light
tent
and
two
light
flies
one
fly
they
gave
for
the
kitchen
use
one
fly
was
allotted
to
kermit
and
me
and
they
kept
only
the
tent
for
themselves
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
went
in
one
tent
the
doctor
and
oliveira
in
another
each
of
us
got
rid
of
everything
above
the
sheer
necessities
this
was
necessary
because
of
the
condition
of
the
the
oxen
were
so
weak
that
the
effort
to
bring
on
the
carts
had
to
be
abandoned
nine
of
the
mules
had
already
been
left
on
the
road
during
the
three
days
march
from
utiarity
in
the
first
expeditions
into
this
country
all
the
baggage
animals
had
died
and
even
in
our
case
the
loss
was
becoming
very
heavy
this
state
of
affairs
is
due
to
the
scarcity
of
forage
and
the
type
of
country
good
grass
is
scanty
and
the
endless
leagues
of
sparse
scrubby
forest
render
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
find
the
animals
when
they
wander
they
must
be
turned
absolutely
loose
to
roam
about
and
pick
up
their
scanty
subsistence
and
must
be
given
as
long
a
time
as
possible
to
feed
and
rest
even
under
these
conditions
most
of
them
grow
weak
when
as
in
our
case
it
is
impossible
to
carry
corn
they
can
not
be
found
again
until
after
daylight
and
then
hours
must
be
spent
in
gathering
them
and
this
means
that
the
march
must
be
made
chiefly
during
the
heat
of
the
day
the
most
trying
time
often
some
of
the
animals
would
not
be
brought
in
until
so
late
that
it
was
well
on
in
the
forenoon
perhaps
midday
before
the
bulk
of
the
train
started
and
they
reached
the
as
often
after
night
fall
as
before
it
under
such
conditions
many
of
the
mules
and
oxen
grew
constantly
weaker
and
ultimately
gave
out
and
it
was
imperative
to
load
them
as
lightly
as
possible
and
discard
all
luxuries
especially
heavy
or
bulky
luxuries
travelling
through
a
wild
country
where
there
is
little
food
for
man
or
beast
is
beset
with
difficulties
almost
inconceivable
to
the
man
who
does
not
himself
know
this
kind
of
wilderness
and
especially
to
the
man
who
only
knows
the
ease
of
civilization
a
scientific
party
of
some
size
with
the
equipment
necessary
in
order
to
do
scientific
work
can
only
go
at
all
if
the
men
who
actually
handle
the
problems
of
food
and
transportation
do
their
work
thoroughly
our
march
continued
through
the
same
type
of
high
nearly
level
upland
covered
with
scanty
scrubby
forest
it
is
the
kind
of
country
known
to
the
brazilians
as
chapadao
pronounced
almost
as
if
it
were
a
french
word
and
spelled
shapadon
our
camp
on
the
fourth
night
was
in
a
beautiful
spot
an
open
grassy
space
beside
a
clear
cool
rushing
little
river
we
ourselves
reached
this
and
waded
our
beasts
across
the
deep
narrow
stream
in
the
late
afternoon
and
we
then
enjoyed
a
bath
and
swim
the
loose
bullocks
arrived
at
sunset
and
with
shrill
cries
the
mounted
herdsmen
urged
them
into
and
across
the
swift
water
the
arrived
long
after
night
fall
and
it
was
not
deemed
wise
to
try
to
cross
the
laden
animals
accordingly
the
loads
were
taken
off
and
brought
over
on
the
heads
of
the
men
it
was
fine
to
see
the
sinewy
naked
figures
bearing
their
burdens
through
the
broken
moonlit
water
to
the
hither
bank
the
night
was
cool
and
pleasant
we
kindled
a
fire
and
sat
beside
the
blaze
then
healthily
hungry
we
gathered
around
the
to
a
delicious
dinner
of
soup
beef
beans
rice
and
coffee
next
day
we
made
a
short
march
crossed
a
brook
and
camped
by
another
clear
deep
rapid
little
river
swollen
by
the
rains
all
these
rivers
that
we
were
crossing
run
actually
into
the
juruena
and
therefore
form
part
of
the
headwaters
of
the
tapajos
for
the
tapajos
is
a
mighty
river
and
the
basin
which
holds
its
headwaters
covers
an
immense
extent
of
country
this
country
and
the
adjacent
regions
forming
the
high
interior
of
western
brazil
will
surely
some
day
support
a
large
industrial
population
of
which
the
advent
would
be
hastened
although
not
necessarily
in
permanently
better
fashion
if
colonel
rondon
anticipations
about
the
development
of
mining
especially
gold
mining
are
realized
in
any
event
the
region
will
be
a
healthy
home
for
a
considerable
agricultural
and
pastoral
population
above
all
the
many
swift
streams
with
their
numerous
waterfalls
some
of
great
height
and
volume
offer
the
chance
for
the
upgrowth
of
a
number
of
big
manufacturing
communities
knit
by
roads
to
one
another
and
to
the
atlantic
coast
and
the
valleys
of
the
paraguay
madeira
and
amazon
and
feeding
and
being
fed
by
the
dwellers
in
the
rich
hot
alluvial
lowlands
that
surround
this
elevated
territory
the
work
of
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
of
the
telegraphic
commission
has
been
to
open
this
great
and
virgin
land
to
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
to
the
service
of
their
nation
in
doing
so
they
have
incidentally
founded
the
brazilian
school
of
exploration
before
their
day
almost
all
the
scientific
and
regular
exploration
of
brazil
was
done
by
foreigners
but
of
course
there
was
much
exploration
and
settlement
by
nameless
brazilians
who
were
merely
endeavoring
to
make
new
homes
or
advance
their
private
fortunes
in
recent
years
by
for
instance
and
a
century
ago
by
those
bold
and
restless
adventurers
partly
of
portuguese
and
partly
of
indian
blood
the
paolistas
from
one
of
whom
colonel
rondon
is
himself
descended
on
his
father
side
the
camp
by
this
river
was
in
some
old
and
fields
once
the
seat
of
a
rather
extensive
maize
and
mandioc
cultivation
by
the
nhambiquaras
on
this
day
cherrie
got
a
number
of
birds
new
to
the
collection
and
two
or
three
of
them
probably
new
to
science
we
had
found
the
birds
for
the
most
part
in
worn
plumage
for
the
breeding
season
the
southern
spring
and
northern
fall
was
over
but
some
birds
were
still
breeding
in
the
tropics
the
breeding
season
is
more
irregular
than
in
the
north
some
birds
breed
at
very
different
times
from
that
chosen
by
the
majority
of
their
fellows
some
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
any
regular
season
cherrie
had
found
one
species
of
breeding
in
every
month
of
the
year
just
before
sunset
and
just
after
sunrise
big
noisy
macaws
flew
over
this
camp
they
were
plentiful
enough
to
form
a
loose
flock
but
each
pair
kept
to
itself
the
two
individuals
always
close
together
and
always
separated
from
the
rest
although
not
an
abundant
it
was
an
interesting
fauna
which
the
two
naturalists
found
in
this
upland
country
where
hitherto
no
collections
of
birds
and
mammals
had
been
made
miller
trapped
several
species
of
opossums
mice
and
rats
which
were
new
to
him
cherrie
got
many
birds
which
he
did
not
recognize
at
this
camp
among
totally
strange
forms
he
found
an
old
and
familiar
acquaintance
before
breakfast
he
brought
in
several
birds
a
dark
colored
flycatcher
with
white
forehead
and
rump
and
two
very
long
a
black
and
tanager
a
black
with
a
concealed
white
spot
on
its
back
at
the
base
of
the
neck
and
its
mate
and
other
birds
which
he
believed
to
be
new
to
science
but
whose
relationships
with
any
of
our
birds
are
so
remote
that
it
is
hard
to
describe
them
save
in
technical
language
finally
among
these
unfamiliar
forms
was
a
veery
and
the
sight
of
the
olive
back
and
faintly
spotted
throat
of
this
singer
of
our
northern
junes
made
us
almost
homesick
next
day
was
brilliantly
clear
the
mules
could
not
be
brought
in
until
quite
late
in
the
morning
and
we
had
to
march
twenty
miles
under
the
burning
tropical
sun
right
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
from
a
rise
of
ground
we
looked
back
over
the
vast
sunlit
landscape
the
endless
rolling
stretches
of
low
forest
midway
on
our
journey
we
crossed
a
brook
the
dogs
minded
the
heat
much
they
continually
ran
off
to
one
side
lay
down
in
a
shady
place
waited
until
we
were
several
hundred
yards
ahead
and
then
raced
after
us
overtook
us
and
repeated
the
performance
the
came
in
about
sunset
but
we
ourselves
reached
the
juruena
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
juruena
is
the
name
by
which
the
tapajos
goes
along
its
upper
course
where
we
crossed
it
was
a
deep
rapid
stream
flowing
in
a
heavily
wooded
valley
with
rather
steep
sides
we
were
ferried
across
on
the
usual
balsa
a
platform
on
three
dugouts
running
by
the
force
of
the
current
on
a
wire
trolley
there
was
a
clearing
on
each
side
with
a
few
palms
and
on
the
farther
bank
were
the
buildings
of
the
telegraph
station
this
is
a
wild
country
and
the
station
was
guarded
by
a
few
soldiers
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
marino
a
native
of
rio
grande
do
sul
a
blond
man
who
looked
like
an
englishman
an
agreeable
companion
and
a
good
and
resolute
officer
as
all
must
be
who
do
their
work
in
this
wilderness
the
juruena
was
first
followed
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
by
the
portuguese
explorer
franco
and
not
again
until
over
a
hundred
years
had
elapsed
when
the
telegraphic
commission
not
only
descended
but
for
the
first
time
accurately
placed
and
mapped
its
course
there
were
several
houses
on
the
rise
of
the
farther
bank
all
with
thatched
roofs
some
of
them
with
walls
of
upright
some
of
them
daub
and
wattle
into
one
of
the
latter
with
two
rooms
we
took
our
belongings
the
were
bothersome
at
night
coming
through
the
interstices
in
the
ordinary
the
first
night
they
did
this
i
got
no
sleep
until
morning
when
it
was
cool
enough
for
me
to
roll
myself
in
my
blanket
and
put
on
a
afterward
we
used
fine
nets
of
a
kind
of
they
were
hot
but
they
kept
out
all
or
almost
all
of
the
and
other
small
tormentors
here
we
overtook
the
rearmost
division
of
captain
amilcar
train
our
own
route
had
diverged
in
order
to
pass
the
great
falls
captain
amilcar
had
come
direct
overtaking
the
which
had
left
tapirapoan
before
we
did
laden
with
material
for
the
duvida
trip
he
had
brought
the
oxen
through
in
fine
shape
losing
only
three
beasts
with
their
loads
and
had
himself
left
the
juruena
the
morning
of
the
day
we
reached
there
his
weakest
animals
left
that
evening
to
make
the
march
by
moonlight
and
as
it
was
desirable
to
give
them
hours
start
we
halted
for
a
day
on
the
banks
of
the
river
it
was
not
a
wasted
day
in
addition
to
bathing
and
washing
our
clothes
the
naturalists
made
some
valuable
additions
to
the
collection
including
a
boldly
marked
black
blue
and
white
jay
and
our
photographs
were
developed
and
our
writing
brought
abreast
of
the
date
travelling
through
a
tropical
wilderness
in
the
rainy
season
when
the
amount
of
baggage
that
can
be
taken
is
strictly
limited
entails
not
only
a
good
deal
of
work
but
also
the
exercise
of
considerable
ingenuity
if
the
writing
and
photographing
and
especially
the
preservation
of
the
specimens
are
to
be
done
in
satisfactory
shape
at
the
telegraph
office
we
received
news
that
the
voyage
of
lauriado
and
fiala
down
the
papagaio
had
opened
with
a
misadventure
in
some
bad
rapids
not
many
miles
below
the
falls
two
of
the
canoes
had
been
upset
half
of
their
provisions
and
all
of
fiala
baggage
lost
and
fiala
himself
nearly
drowned
the
papagaio
is
known
both
at
the
source
and
the
mouth
to
descend
it
did
not
represent
a
plunge
into
the
unknown
as
in
the
case
of
the
duvida
or
the
ananas
but
the
actual
water
work
over
the
part
that
was
unexplored
offered
the
same
possibilities
of
mischance
and
disaster
it
is
a
hazardous
thing
to
descend
a
swift
unknown
river
rushing
through
an
uninhabited
wilderness
to
descend
or
ascend
the
ordinary
great
highway
rivers
of
south
america
such
as
the
amazon
paraguay
tapajos
and
in
its
lower
course
the
orinoco
is
now
so
safe
and
easy
whether
by
boat
or
big
native
that
people
are
apt
to
forget
the
very
serious
difficulties
offered
by
the
streams
often
themselves
great
rivers
which
run
into
or
form
the
upper
courses
of
these
same
water
highways
few
things
are
easier
than
the
former
feat
and
few
more
difficult
than
the
latter
and
experience
in
ordinary
travelling
on
the
lower
courses
of
the
rivers
is
of
no
benefit
whatever
in
enabling
a
man
to
form
a
judgement
as
to
what
can
be
done
and
how
to
do
it
on
the
upper
courses
failure
to
remember
this
fact
is
one
of
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
securing
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
needs
and
the
results
of
south
american
exploration
at
the
juruena
we
met
a
party
of
nhambiquaras
very
friendly
and
sociable
and
very
glad
to
see
colonel
rondon
they
were
originally
exceedingly
hostile
and
suspicious
but
the
colonel
unwearied
thoughtfulness
and
good
temper
joined
with
his
indomitable
resolution
enabled
him
to
avoid
war
and
to
secure
their
friendship
and
even
their
aid
he
never
killed
one
many
of
them
are
known
to
him
personally
he
is
on
remarkably
good
terms
with
them
and
they
are
very
fond
of
him
although
this
does
not
prevent
them
from
now
and
then
yielding
to
temptation
even
at
his
expense
and
stealing
a
dog
or
something
else
which
strikes
them
as
offering
an
irresistible
attraction
they
can
not
be
employed
at
steady
work
but
they
do
occasional
odd
jobs
and
are
excellent
at
hunting
up
strayed
mules
or
oxen
and
a
few
of
the
men
have
begun
to
wear
clothes
purely
for
ornament
their
confidence
and
bold
friendliness
showed
how
well
they
had
been
treated
probably
half
of
our
visitors
were
men
several
were
small
boys
one
was
a
woman
with
a
baby
the
others
were
young
married
women
and
girls
nowhere
in
africa
did
we
come
across
wilder
or
more
absolutely
primitive
savages
although
these
indians
were
pleasanter
and
featured
than
any
of
the
african
tribes
at
the
same
stage
of
culture
both
sexes
were
and
rather
with
fairly
good
teeth
although
some
of
them
seemed
to
have
skin
diseases
they
were
a
laughing
crew
and
the
women
were
as
as
the
men
and
were
obviously
from
the
savage
standpoint
there
was
no
male
brutality
like
that
which
forms
such
a
revolting
feature
in
the
life
of
the
australian
black
fellows
and
although
to
a
somewhat
less
degree
in
the
life
of
so
many
negro
and
indian
tribes
they
were
practically
absolutely
naked
in
many
savage
tribes
the
men
go
absolutely
naked
but
the
women
wear
a
or
loincloth
in
certain
tribes
we
saw
near
lake
victoria
nyanza
and
on
the
upper
white
nile
both
men
and
women
were
practically
naked
among
these
nhambiquaras
the
women
were
more
completely
naked
than
the
men
although
the
difference
was
not
essential
the
men
wore
a
string
around
the
waist
most
of
them
wore
nothing
else
but
a
few
had
loosely
hanging
from
this
string
in
front
a
scanty
tuft
of
dried
grass
or
a
small
piece
of
cloth
which
however
was
of
purely
symbolic
use
so
far
as
either
protection
or
modesty
was
concerned
the
women
did
not
wear
a
stitch
of
any
kind
anywhere
on
their
bodies
they
did
not
have
on
so
much
as
a
string
or
a
bead
or
even
an
ornament
in
their
hair
they
were
all
men
and
women
boys
and
young
girls
as
entirely
at
ease
and
unconscious
as
so
many
friendly
animals
all
of
them
men
women
and
children
laughing
and
talking
crowded
around
us
whether
we
were
on
horseback
or
on
foot
they
flocked
into
the
house
and
when
i
sat
down
to
write
surrounded
me
so
closely
that
i
had
to
push
them
gently
away
the
women
and
girls
often
stood
holding
one
another
hands
or
with
their
arms
over
one
another
shoulders
or
around
one
another
waists
offering
an
attractive
picture
the
men
had
holes
pierced
through
the
septum
of
the
nose
and
through
the
upper
lip
and
wore
a
straw
through
each
hole
the
women
were
not
marked
or
mutilated
it
seems
like
a
contradiction
in
terms
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
fact
that
the
behavior
of
these
completely
naked
women
and
men
was
entirely
modest
there
was
never
an
indecent
look
or
a
consciously
indecent
gesture
they
had
no
blankets
or
hammocks
and
when
night
came
simply
lay
down
in
the
sand
colonel
rondon
stated
that
they
never
wore
a
covering
by
night
or
by
day
and
if
it
was
cool
slept
one
on
each
side
of
a
small
fire
their
huts
were
merely
slight
shelters
against
the
rain
the
moon
was
nearly
full
and
after
nightfall
a
few
of
the
indians
suddenly
held
an
improvised
dance
for
us
in
front
of
our
house
there
were
four
men
a
small
boy
and
two
young
women
or
grown
girls
two
of
the
men
had
been
doing
some
work
for
the
commission
and
were
dressed
one
completely
and
one
partially
in
ordinary
clothes
two
of
the
men
and
the
boy
were
practically
naked
and
the
two
young
women
were
absolutely
so
all
of
them
danced
in
a
circle
without
a
touch
of
embarrassment
or
impropriety
the
two
girls
kept
hold
of
each
hands
throughout
dancing
among
the
men
as
modestly
as
possible
and
with
the
occasional
interchange
of
a
laugh
or
jest
in
as
good
taste
and
temper
as
in
any
dance
in
civilization
the
dance
consisted
in
slowly
going
round
in
a
circle
first
one
way
then
the
other
rhythmically
beating
time
with
the
feet
to
the
music
of
the
song
they
were
chanting
the
chants
there
were
three
of
them
all
told
were
measured
and
rather
slowly
uttered
melodies
varied
with
an
occasional
shrill
cry
the
women
continually
uttered
a
kind
of
drawn
wailing
or
droning
i
am
not
enough
of
a
musician
to
say
whether
it
was
an
overtone
or
the
sustaining
of
the
burden
of
the
ballad
the
young
boy
sang
better
than
any
of
the
others
it
was
a
strange
and
interesting
sight
to
see
these
utterly
wild
friendly
savages
circling
in
their
slow
dance
and
chanting
their
immemorial
melodies
in
the
brilliant
tropical
moonlight
with
the
river
rushing
by
in
the
background
through
the
lonely
heart
of
the
wilderness
the
indians
stayed
with
us
feasting
dancing
and
singing
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
they
then
suddenly
and
silently
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
did
not
return
in
the
morning
we
discovered
that
they
had
gone
off
with
one
of
colonel
rondon
dogs
probably
the
temptation
had
proved
irresistible
to
one
of
their
number
and
the
others
had
been
afraid
to
interfere
and
also
afraid
to
stay
in
or
return
to
our
neighborhood
we
had
not
time
to
go
after
them
but
rondon
remarked
that
as
soon
as
he
again
came
to
the
neighborhood
he
would
take
some
soldiers
hunt
up
the
indians
and
reclaim
the
dog
it
has
been
his
mixture
of
firmness
good
nature
and
good
judgment
that
has
enabled
him
to
control
these
bold
warlike
savages
and
even
to
reduce
the
warfare
between
them
and
the
parecis
in
spite
of
their
good
nature
and
laughter
their
fearlessness
and
familiarity
showed
how
necessary
it
was
not
to
let
them
get
the
upper
hand
they
are
always
required
to
leave
all
their
arms
a
mile
or
two
away
before
they
come
into
the
encampment
they
are
much
wilder
and
more
savage
and
at
a
much
lower
cultural
level
than
the
parecis
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
our
arrival
there
was
a
heavy
which
drove
into
the
unglazed
windows
and
here
and
there
came
through
the
roof
and
walls
of
our
house
the
heat
was
intense
and
there
was
much
moisture
in
this
valley
during
the
downpour
i
looked
out
at
the
dreary
little
houses
showing
through
the
driving
rain
while
the
sheets
of
muddy
water
slid
past
their
sills
and
i
felt
a
sincere
respect
for
the
lieutenant
and
his
soldiers
who
were
holding
this
desolate
outpost
of
civilization
it
is
an
unhealthy
spot
there
has
been
much
malarial
fever
and
beriberi
an
obscure
and
deadly
disease
next
morning
we
resumed
our
march
it
soon
began
to
rain
and
we
were
drenched
when
some
fifteen
miles
on
we
reached
the
river
where
we
were
to
camp
after
the
great
heat
we
felt
quite
cold
in
our
wet
clothes
and
gladly
crowded
round
a
fire
which
was
kindled
under
a
thatched
shed
beside
the
cabin
of
the
ferryman
this
was
so
small
that
it
could
only
take
one
mule
or
at
most
two
at
a
time
the
mules
and
a
span
of
six
oxen
dragging
an
which
we
had
overtaken
were
ferried
slowly
to
the
farther
side
that
afternoon
as
there
was
no
feed
on
the
hither
bank
where
we
ourselves
camped
the
ferryman
was
a
soldier
in
the
employ
of
the
telegraphic
commission
his
wife
evidently
of
both
indian
and
negro
blood
was
with
him
and
was
doing
all
she
could
do
as
a
housekeeper
in
the
comfortless
little
cabin
with
its
primitive
bareness
of
furniture
and
fittings
here
we
saw
captain
amilcar
who
had
come
back
to
hurry
up
his
guard
we
stood
in
mud
and
water
by
the
swollen
river
while
the
rain
beat
on
us
and
enjoyed
a
few
minutes
talk
with
the
cool
competent
officer
who
was
doing
a
difficult
job
with
such
efficiency
he
had
no
poncho
and
was
wet
through
but
was
much
too
busy
in
getting
his
laden
oxen
forward
to
think
of
personal
discomfort
he
had
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
his
mules
but
his
oxen
were
still
in
fair
shape
after
leaving
the
juruena
the
ground
became
somewhat
more
hilly
and
the
scrubby
forest
was
less
open
but
otherwise
there
was
no
change
in
the
monotonous
and
yet
to
me
rather
attractive
landscape
the
hills
and
the
in
the
trees
arboreal
so
to
speak
were
as
conspicuous
as
ever
the
architects
of
some
were
red
ants
of
others
black
ants
and
others
which
were
on
the
whole
the
largest
had
been
built
by
the
white
ants
the
termites
the
latter
were
not
infrequently
taller
than
a
horseman
head
that
evening
round
the
colonel
rondon
happened
to
mention
how
the
brother
of
one
of
the
soldiers
with
us
a
parecis
indian
had
been
killed
by
a
jararaca
snake
cherrie
told
of
a
narrow
escape
he
had
from
one
while
collecting
in
guiana
at
night
he
used
to
set
traps
in
camp
for
small
mammals
one
night
he
heard
one
of
these
traps
go
off
under
his
hammock
he
reached
down
for
it
and
as
he
fumbled
for
the
chain
he
felt
a
snake
strike
at
him
just
missing
him
in
the
darkness
but
actually
brushing
his
hand
he
lit
a
light
and
saw
that
a
big
jararaca
had
been
caught
in
the
trap
and
he
preserved
it
as
a
specimen
snakes
frequently
came
into
his
camp
after
nightfall
he
killed
one
rattlesnake
which
had
swallowed
the
skinned
bodies
of
four
mice
he
had
prepared
as
specimens
which
shows
that
rattlesnakes
do
not
always
feed
only
on
living
prey
another
rattlesnake
which
he
killed
in
central
america
had
just
swallowed
an
opossum
which
proved
to
be
of
a
species
new
to
science
miller
told
how
once
on
the
orinoco
he
saw
on
the
bank
a
small
anaconda
some
ten
feet
long
killing
one
of
the
iguanas
big
active
truculent
carnivorous
lizards
equally
at
home
on
the
land
and
in
the
water
evidently
the
iguanas
were
digging
out
holes
in
the
bank
in
which
to
lay
their
eggs
for
there
were
several
such
holes
and
iguanas
working
at
them
the
snake
had
crushed
its
prey
to
a
pulp
and
not
more
than
a
couple
of
feet
away
another
iguana
was
still
busily
and
with
entire
unconcern
engaged
in
making
its
burrow
at
miller
approach
the
anaconda
left
the
dead
iguana
and
rushed
into
the
water
and
the
live
iguana
promptly
followed
it
miller
also
told
of
the
stone
gods
and
altars
and
temples
he
had
seen
in
the
great
colombian
forests
monuments
of
strange
civilizations
which
flourished
and
died
out
ages
ago
and
of
which
all
memory
has
vanished
he
and
cherrie
told
of
giant
rivers
and
waterfalls
and
of
forests
never
penetrated
and
mountains
never
ascended
by
civilized
man
and
of
bloody
revolutions
that
devastated
the
settled
regions
listening
to
them
i
felt
that
they
could
write
tales
of
two
naturalists
that
would
be
worth
reading
they
were
short
of
literature
by
the
way
a
party
such
as
ours
always
needs
books
and
as
kermit
consisted
chiefly
of
camoens
and
other
portuguese
or
else
brazilian
writers
i
strove
to
supply
the
deficiency
with
spare
volumes
of
gibbon
at
the
end
of
our
march
we
were
usually
far
ahead
of
the
and
the
rain
was
also
usually
falling
accordingly
we
would
sit
about
under
trees
or
under
a
shed
or
if
there
was
one
each
solemnly
reading
a
volume
of
gibbon
and
no
better
reading
can
be
found
in
my
own
case
as
i
had
been
having
rather
a
steady
course
of
gibbon
i
varied
him
now
and
then
with
a
volume
of
arsene
lupin
lent
me
by
kermit
there
were
many
swollen
rivers
to
cross
at
this
point
of
our
journey
some
we
waded
at
fords
some
we
crossed
by
rude
bridges
the
larger
ones
such
as
the
juina
we
crossed
by
ferry
and
when
the
approaches
were
swampy
and
the
river
broad
and
swift
many
hours
might
be
consumed
in
getting
the
the
loose
bullocks
and
the
cart
over
we
had
few
accidents
although
we
once
lost
a
of
provisions
which
was
quite
a
misfortune
in
a
country
where
they
could
not
be
replaced
the
pasturage
was
poor
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
long
marches
with
our
weakened
animals
at
one
camp
three
nhambiquaras
paid
us
a
visit
at
breakfast
time
they
left
their
weapons
behind
them
before
they
appeared
and
shouted
loudly
while
they
were
still
hid
by
the
forest
and
it
was
only
after
repeated
answering
calls
of
welcome
that
they
approached
always
in
the
wilderness
friends
proclaim
their
presence
a
silent
advance
marks
a
foe
our
visitors
were
men
and
stark
naked
as
usual
one
seemed
sick
he
was
thin
and
his
back
was
scarred
with
marks
of
the
grub
of
the
loathsome
berni
fly
indeed
all
of
them
showed
scars
chiefly
from
insect
wounds
but
the
other
two
were
in
good
condition
and
although
they
ate
greedily
of
the
food
offered
them
they
had
with
them
a
big
mandioc
cake
some
honey
and
a
little
fish
one
of
them
wore
a
high
helmet
of
with
the
tail
hanging
down
his
back
handsome
which
he
gladly
bartered
for
several
strings
of
bright
beads
around
the
upper
arms
of
two
of
them
were
bands
bound
so
tightly
as
to
cut
into
and
deform
the
muscles
a
singular
custom
seemingly
not
only
purposeless
but
mischievous
which
is
common
among
this
tribe
and
many
others
the
nhambiquaras
are
a
numerous
tribe
covering
a
large
region
but
they
have
no
general
organization
each
group
of
families
acts
for
itself
half
a
dozen
years
previously
they
had
been
very
hostile
and
colonel
rondon
had
to
guard
his
camp
and
exercise
every
precaution
to
guarantee
his
safety
while
at
the
same
time
successfully
endeavoring
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
himself
shedding
blood
now
they
are
for
the
most
part
friendly
but
there
are
groups
or
individuals
that
are
not
several
soldiers
have
been
killed
at
these
little
lonely
stations
and
while
in
some
cases
the
attack
may
have
been
due
to
the
soldiers
having
meddled
with
nhambiquara
women
in
other
cases
the
killing
was
entirely
wanton
and
unprovoked
sooner
or
later
these
criminals
or
outlaws
will
have
to
be
brought
to
justice
it
will
not
do
to
let
their
crimes
go
unpunished
twice
soldiers
have
deserted
and
fled
to
the
nhambiquaras
the
runaways
were
well
received
were
given
wives
and
adopted
into
the
tribe
the
country
when
opened
will
be
a
healthy
abode
for
white
settlers
but
pioneering
in
the
wilderness
is
grim
work
for
both
man
and
beast
continually
as
we
journeyed
onward
under
the
pitiless
glare
of
the
sun
or
through
blinding
torrents
of
rain
we
passed
desolate
little
graves
by
the
roadside
they
marked
the
last
resting
places
of
men
who
had
died
by
fever
or
dysentery
or
nhambiquara
arrows
we
raised
our
hats
as
our
mules
plodded
slowly
by
through
the
sand
on
each
grave
was
a
frail
wooden
cross
and
this
and
the
paling
round
about
were
already
stained
by
the
weather
as
gray
as
the
tree
trunks
of
the
stunted
forest
that
stretched
endlessly
on
every
side
the
skeletons
of
mules
and
oxen
were
frequent
along
the
road
now
and
then
we
came
across
a
mule
or
ox
which
had
been
abandoned
by
captain
amilcar
party
ahead
of
us
the
animal
had
been
left
with
the
hope
that
when
night
came
it
would
follow
along
the
trail
to
water
sometimes
it
did
so
sometimes
we
found
it
dead
or
standing
motionless
waiting
for
death
from
time
to
time
we
had
to
leave
behind
one
of
our
own
mules
it
was
not
always
easy
to
recognize
what
pasturage
the
mules
would
accept
as
good
one
afternoon
we
pitched
camp
by
a
tiny
rivulet
in
the
midst
of
the
scrubby
upland
forest
a
camp
by
the
way
where
the
piums
the
small
biting
flies
were
a
torment
during
the
hours
of
daylight
while
after
dark
their
places
were
more
than
taken
by
the
diminutive
gnats
which
the
brazilians
expressively
term
polvora
or
powder
and
which
get
through
the
smallest
meshes
of
a
the
feed
was
so
scanty
and
the
cover
so
dense
at
this
spot
that
i
thought
we
would
have
great
difficulty
in
gathering
the
mules
next
morning
but
we
did
not
a
few
hours
later
in
the
afternoon
we
camped
by
a
beautiful
open
meadow
on
one
side
ran
a
rapid
brook
with
a
waterfall
eight
feet
high
under
which
we
bathed
and
swam
here
the
feed
looked
so
good
that
we
all
expressed
pleasure
but
the
mules
did
not
like
it
and
after
nightfall
they
hiked
back
on
the
trail
and
it
was
a
long
and
arduous
work
to
gather
them
next
morning
i
have
touched
above
on
the
insect
pests
men
unused
to
the
south
american
wilderness
speak
with
awe
of
the
danger
therein
from
jaguars
crocodiles
and
poisonous
snakes
in
reality
the
danger
from
these
sources
is
trivial
much
less
than
the
danger
of
being
run
down
by
an
automobile
at
home
but
at
times
the
torment
of
insect
plagues
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
there
are
many
different
species
of
mosquitoes
some
of
them
bearers
of
disease
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
small
biting
flies
and
gnats
loosely
grouped
together
under
various
titles
the
ones
more
especially
called
piums
by
my
companions
were
somewhat
like
our
northern
black
flies
they
gorged
themselves
with
blood
at
the
moment
their
bites
did
not
hurt
but
they
left
an
itching
scar
and
gloves
are
a
protection
but
are
not
very
comfortable
in
stifling
hot
weather
it
is
impossible
to
sleep
without
when
settlers
of
the
right
type
come
into
a
new
land
they
speedily
learn
to
take
the
measures
necessary
to
minimize
the
annoyance
caused
by
all
these
pests
those
that
are
winged
have
plenty
of
kinsfolk
in
so
much
of
the
northern
continent
as
has
not
yet
been
subdued
by
man
but
the
most
noxious
of
the
south
american
ants
have
thank
heaven
no
representatives
in
north
america
at
the
camp
of
the
piums
a
column
of
the
carnivorous
foraging
ants
made
its
appearance
before
nightfall
and
for
a
time
we
feared
it
might
put
us
out
of
our
tents
for
it
went
straight
through
camp
between
the
and
our
own
sleeping
tents
however
the
column
turned
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
streaming
uninterruptedly
past
for
several
hours
and
doing
no
damage
except
to
the
legs
of
any
incautious
man
who
walked
near
it
on
the
afternoon
of
february
we
reached
campos
novos
this
place
was
utterly
unlike
the
country
we
had
been
traversing
it
was
a
large
basin
several
miles
across
traversed
by
several
brooks
the
brooks
ran
in
deep
swampy
valleys
occupied
by
a
matted
growth
of
tall
tropical
forest
between
them
the
ground
rose
in
bold
hills
bare
of
forest
and
covered
with
grass
on
which
our
jaded
animals
fed
eagerly
on
one
of
these
rounded
hills
a
number
of
buildings
were
ranged
in
a
quadrangle
for
the
pasturage
at
this
spot
is
so
good
that
it
is
permanently
occupied
there
were
milch
cows
and
we
got
delicious
fresh
milk
and
there
were
goats
pigs
turkeys
and
chickens
most
of
the
buildings
were
made
of
upright
poles
with
roofs
of
palm
thatch
one
or
two
were
of
native
brick
plastered
with
mud
and
before
these
there
was
an
enclosure
with
a
few
ragged
palms
and
some
pineapple
plants
here
we
halted
our
attendants
made
two
kitchens
one
was
out
in
the
open
air
one
was
under
a
shelter
of
the
view
over
the
surrounding
grassy
hills
riven
by
deep
wooded
valleys
was
lovely
the
air
was
cool
and
fresh
we
were
not
bothered
by
insects
although
mosquitoes
swarmed
in
every
belt
of
timber
yet
there
has
been
much
fever
at
this
beautiful
and
seemingly
healthy
place
doubtless
when
settlement
is
sufficiently
advanced
a
remedy
will
be
developed
the
geology
of
this
neighborhood
was
interesting
oliveira
found
fossil
which
he
believed
to
be
of
cretaceous
age
here
we
found
amilcar
and
mello
who
had
waited
for
us
with
the
guard
of
their
and
we
enjoyed
our
meeting
with
the
two
fine
fellows
than
whom
no
military
service
of
any
nation
could
produce
more
efficient
men
for
this
kind
of
difficult
and
responsible
work
next
morning
they
mustered
their
soldiers
muleteers
and
ox
men
and
marched
off
reinisch
the
taxidermist
was
with
them
we
followed
in
the
late
afternoon
camping
after
a
few
miles
we
left
the
oxcart
at
campos
novos
from
thence
on
the
trail
was
only
for
animals
in
this
neighborhood
the
two
naturalists
found
many
birds
which
we
had
not
hitherto
met
the
most
conspicuous
was
a
huge
oriole
the
size
of
a
small
crow
with
a
naked
face
a
bill
and
gaudily
variegated
plumage
of
green
yellow
and
chestnut
very
interesting
was
the
false
bellbird
a
gray
bird
with
loud
metallic
notes
there
was
also
a
tiny
woodpecker
no
larger
than
a
kinglet
a
queer
with
a
slightly
flexible
bill
and
many
species
of
tanager
manakin
and
tody
among
these
unfamiliar
forms
was
a
vireo
looking
much
like
our
solitary
vireo
at
one
camp
cherrie
collected
a
dozen
perching
birds
miller
a
beautiful
little
rail
and
kermit
with
the
small
luger
a
handsome
curassow
nearly
as
big
as
a
turkey
out
of
which
after
it
had
been
skinned
the
cook
made
a
delicious
canja
the
thick
brazilian
soup
of
fowl
and
rice
than
which
there
is
nothing
better
of
its
kind
all
these
birds
were
new
to
the
collection
no
naturalists
had
previously
worked
this
region
so
that
the
afternoon
work
represented
nine
species
new
to
the
collection
six
new
genera
and
a
most
excellent
soup
two
days
after
leaving
campos
novos
we
reached
vilhena
where
there
is
a
telegraph
station
we
camped
once
at
a
small
river
named
by
colonel
rondon
the
twelfth
of
october
because
he
reached
it
on
the
day
columbus
discovered
america
i
had
never
before
known
what
day
it
was
and
once
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
which
he
had
named
after
lyra
his
companion
in
the
exploration
the
two
days
march
really
one
full
day
and
part
of
two
others
was
through
beautiful
country
and
we
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
although
there
were
occasional
driving
storms
when
the
rain
came
in
almost
level
sheets
and
drenched
every
one
and
everything
the
country
was
like
that
around
campos
novos
and
offered
a
striking
contrast
to
the
level
barren
sandy
wastes
of
the
chapadao
which
is
a
healthy
region
where
great
industrial
centres
can
arise
but
not
suited
for
extensive
agriculture
as
are
the
lowland
flats
for
these
hours
the
trail
climbed
into
and
out
of
steep
valleys
and
broad
basins
and
up
and
down
hills
in
the
deep
valleys
were
magnificent
woods
in
which
giant
towered
while
the
huge
leaves
of
the
pacova
or
wild
banana
were
conspicuous
in
the
undergrowth
great
azure
butterflies
flitted
through
the
open
sunny
glades
and
the
bellbirds
sitting
motionless
uttered
their
ringing
calls
from
the
dark
stillness
of
the
columned
groves
the
hillsides
were
grassy
pastures
or
else
covered
with
low
open
forest
a
huge
frog
brown
above
with
a
light
streak
down
each
side
was
found
hiding
under
some
sticks
in
a
damp
place
in
one
of
the
improvised
kitchens
and
another
frog
with
disks
on
his
toes
was
caught
on
one
of
the
tents
a
puzzled
us
some
snakes
are
harmless
others
are
poisonous
although
not
aggressive
the
best
authorities
give
an
infallible
recipe
for
distinguishing
them
by
the
pattern
of
the
colors
but
this
particular
specimen
although
it
corresponded
exactly
in
color
pattern
with
the
description
of
the
poisonous
snakes
nevertheless
had
no
that
even
after
the
most
minute
examination
we
could
discover
miller
and
one
of
the
dogs
caught
a
sariema
a
big
bird
in
rather
a
curious
way
we
were
on
the
march
plodding
along
through
as
heavy
a
tropic
downpour
as
it
was
our
ill
fortune
to
encounter
the
sariema
evidently
as
drenched
and
uncomfortable
as
we
were
was
hiding
under
a
bush
to
avoid
the
pelting
rain
the
dog
discovered
it
and
after
the
bird
valiantly
repelled
him
miller
was
able
to
seize
it
its
stomach
contained
about
half
a
pint
of
and
beetles
and
young
leaves
at
vilhena
there
was
a
tame
sariema
much
more
familiar
and
at
home
than
any
of
the
poultry
it
was
without
the
least
fear
of
man
or
dog
the
sariema
like
the
screamer
and
the
curassow
ought
to
be
introduced
into
our
barnyards
and
on
our
lawns
at
any
rate
in
the
southern
states
it
is
a
friendly
and
attractive
bird
another
bird
we
met
is
in
some
places
far
more
intimate
and
domesticates
itself
this
is
the
pretty
little
in
colombia
miller
found
the
habitually
coming
inside
the
houses
and
hotels
at
hopping
about
the
table
and
climbing
into
the
along
this
part
of
our
march
there
was
much
of
what
at
a
hasty
glance
seemed
to
be
volcanic
rock
but
oliveira
showed
me
that
it
was
a
kind
of
conglomerate
with
bubbles
or
hollows
in
it
made
of
sand
and
bearing
earth
he
said
it
was
a
superficial
quaternary
deposit
formed
by
erosion
from
the
cretaceous
rocks
and
that
there
were
here
no
tertiary
deposits
he
described
the
geological
structure
of
the
lands
through
which
we
had
passed
as
follows
the
pantanals
were
of
pleistocene
age
along
the
upper
sepotuba
in
the
region
of
the
rapids
there
were
sandstones
shales
and
clays
of
permian
age
the
rolling
country
east
of
this
contained
eruptive
rocks
a
porphyritic
disbase
with
zeolite
quartz
and
agate
of
triassic
age
with
the
chapadao
of
the
parecis
plateau
we
came
to
a
land
of
sand
and
clay
dotted
with
lumps
of
sandstone
and
pieces
of
petrified
wood
this
according
to
oliveira
is
of
mesozoic
age
possibly
cretaceous
and
similar
to
the
south
african
formation
there
are
geologists
who
consider
it
as
of
permian
age
at
vilhena
we
were
on
a
watershed
which
drained
into
the
which
itself
runs
into
the
madeira
nearly
midway
between
its
sources
and
its
mouth
a
little
farther
along
and
northward
we
again
came
to
streams
running
ultimately
into
the
tapajos
and
between
them
and
close
to
them
were
streamlets
which
drained
into
the
duvida
and
ananas
whose
courses
and
outlets
were
unknown
this
point
is
part
of
the
divide
between
the
basins
of
the
madeira
and
tapajos
a
singular
topographical
feature
of
the
plan
alto
the
great
interior
sandy
plateau
of
brazil
is
that
at
its
westernmost
end
the
southward
flowing
streams
instead
of
running
into
the
paraguay
as
they
do
farther
east
form
the
headwaters
of
the
guapore
which
may
perhaps
be
called
the
upper
main
stream
of
the
madeira
these
westernmost
streams
from
the
southern
edge
of
the
plateau
therefore
begin
by
flowing
south
then
for
a
long
stretch
they
flow
southwest
then
north
and
finally
northeast
into
the
amazon
according
to
some
exceptionally
good
geological
observers
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
in
a
remote
geologic
past
the
ocean
sent
in
an
arm
from
the
south
between
the
plan
alto
and
what
is
now
the
andean
chain
these
rivers
then
emptied
into
the
andean
sea
the
gradual
upheaval
of
the
soil
has
resulted
in
substituting
dry
land
for
this
arm
of
the
ocean
and
in
reversing
the
course
of
what
is
now
the
madeira
just
as
according
to
these
geologists
in
somewhat
familiar
fashion
the
amazon
has
been
reversed
it
having
once
been
at
least
for
the
upper
two
thirds
of
its
course
an
affluent
of
the
andean
sea
from
vilhena
we
travelled
in
a
generally
northward
direction
for
a
few
leagues
we
went
across
the
chapadao
the
sands
or
clays
of
the
nearly
level
upland
plateau
grassy
or
covered
with
thin
stunted
forest
the
same
type
of
country
that
had
been
predominant
ever
since
we
ascended
the
parecis
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
leaving
the
sepotuba
then
at
about
the
point
where
the
trail
dipped
into
a
basin
containing
the
of
the
ananas
we
left
this
type
of
country
and
began
to
march
through
thick
forest
not
very
high
there
was
little
feed
for
the
animals
on
the
chapadao
there
was
less
in
the
forest
moreover
the
continual
heavy
rains
made
the
travelling
difficult
and
laborious
for
them
and
they
weakened
however
a
couple
of
marches
before
we
reached
tres
burity
where
there
is
a
big
ranch
with
hundreds
of
cattle
we
were
met
by
ten
fresh
and
our
serious
difficulties
were
over
there
were
piums
in
plenty
by
day
but
neither
mosquitoes
nor
by
night
and
for
us
the
trip
was
very
pleasant
save
for
moments
of
anxiety
about
the
mules
the
loose
bullocks
furnished
us
abundance
of
fresh
beef
although
as
was
inevitable
under
the
circumstances
of
a
decidedly
tough
quality
one
of
the
biggest
of
the
bullocks
was
attacked
one
night
by
a
vampire
bat
and
next
morning
his
withers
were
literally
bathed
in
blood
with
the
chapadao
we
said
to
the
curious
gregarious
and
crepuscular
or
nocturnal
spiders
which
we
found
so
abundant
along
the
line
of
the
telegraph
wire
they
have
offered
one
of
the
small
problems
with
which
the
commission
has
had
to
deal
they
are
not
common
in
the
dry
season
they
swarm
during
the
rains
and
when
their
tough
webs
are
wet
those
that
lead
from
the
wire
to
the
ground
sometimes
effectually
short
circuit
the
wire
they
have
on
various
occasions
caused
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
this
manner
the
third
night
out
from
vilhena
we
emerged
for
a
moment
from
the
endless
forest
in
which
our
poor
animals
got
such
scanty
pickings
and
came
to
a
beautiful
open
country
where
grassy
slopes
dotted
with
occasional
trees
came
down
on
either
side
of
a
little
brook
which
was
one
of
the
headwaters
of
the
duvida
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
the
mules
greedily
bury
their
muzzles
in
the
pasturage
our
tents
were
pitched
in
the
open
near
a
shady
tree
which
sent
out
its
low
branches
on
every
side
at
this
camp
cherrie
shot
a
lark
very
characteristic
of
the
open
upland
country
and
miller
found
two
bats
in
the
rotten
wood
of
a
dead
log
he
heard
them
squeaking
and
dug
them
out
he
could
not
tell
by
what
method
they
had
gotten
in
here
kermit
while
a
couple
of
miles
from
our
tents
came
across
an
encampment
of
nhambiquaras
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
men
women
and
a
few
children
kermit
after
the
manner
of
honest
folk
in
the
wilderness
advanced
ostentatiously
in
the
open
calling
out
to
give
warning
of
his
coming
like
surroundings
may
cause
like
manners
the
early
saxons
in
england
deemed
it
legal
to
kill
any
man
who
came
through
the
woods
without
shouting
or
blowing
a
horn
and
in
nhambiquara
land
at
the
present
time
it
is
against
etiquette
and
may
be
very
unhealthy
to
come
through
the
woods
toward
strangers
without
loudly
announcing
one
presence
the
nhambiquaras
received
kermit
with
the
utmost
cordiality
and
gave
him
to
drink
they
were
stark
naked
as
usual
they
had
no
hammocks
or
blankets
and
their
huts
were
flimsy
shelters
of
yet
they
were
in
fine
condition
half
a
dozen
of
the
men
and
a
couple
of
boys
accompanied
kermit
back
to
our
camp
paying
not
slightest
heed
to
the
rain
which
was
falling
they
were
bold
and
friendly
at
least
superficially
and
very
inquisitive
in
feasting
the
long
reeds
thrust
through
holes
in
their
lips
did
not
seem
to
bother
them
and
they
laughed
at
the
suggestion
of
removing
them
evidently
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
rather
bad
manners
like
using
a
knife
as
an
aid
in
eating
they
held
two
or
three
dances
and
we
were
again
struck
by
the
rhythm
and
weird
haunting
melody
of
their
chanting
after
supper
they
danced
beside
the
and
finally
to
their
delight
most
of
the
members
of
our
own
party
americans
and
brazilians
enthusiastically
joined
the
dance
while
the
colonel
and
i
furnished
an
appreciative
and
applauding
audience
next
morning
when
we
were
awakened
by
the
chattering
and
screaming
of
the
numerous
macaws
parrots
and
parakeets
we
found
that
nearly
all
the
indians
men
and
women
were
gathered
outside
the
tent
as
far
as
clothing
was
concerned
they
were
in
the
condition
of
adam
and
eve
before
the
fall
one
of
the
women
carried
a
little
squirrel
monkey
she
put
it
up
the
big
tree
some
distance
from
the
tents
and
when
she
called
it
came
scampering
to
her
across
the
grass
ran
up
her
and
clung
to
her
neck
they
would
have
liked
to
pilfer
but
as
they
had
no
clothes
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
conceal
anything
one
of
the
women
was
observed
to
take
a
fork
but
as
she
did
not
possess
a
rag
of
clothing
of
any
kind
all
she
did
do
was
to
try
to
bury
the
fork
in
the
sand
and
then
sit
on
it
and
it
was
reclaimed
without
difficulty
one
or
two
of
the
children
wore
necklaces
and
bracelets
made
of
the
polished
wood
of
the
tucum
palm
and
of
the
molars
of
small
rodents
next
day
march
led
us
across
a
hilly
country
of
good
pastureland
the
valleys
were
densely
wooded
palms
of
several
kinds
being
conspicuous
among
the
other
trees
and
the
brooks
at
the
bottoms
we
crossed
at
fords
or
by
the
usual
rude
pole
bridges
on
the
open
pastures
were
occasional
trees
usually
slender
bacaba
palms
with
heads
which
the
winds
had
dishevelled
until
they
looked
like
mops
it
was
evidently
a
fine
natural
cattle
country
and
we
soon
began
to
see
scores
perhaps
hundreds
of
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
government
ranch
at
tres
burity
which
we
reached
in
the
early
afternoon
it
is
beautifully
situated
the
view
roundabout
is
lovely
and
certainly
the
land
will
prove
healthy
when
settlements
have
been
definitely
established
here
we
revelled
in
abundance
of
good
fresh
milk
and
eggs
and
for
dinner
we
had
chicken
canja
and
fat
beef
roasted
on
big
wooden
spits
and
we
even
had
watermelons
the
latter
were
from
seeds
brought
down
by
the
american
engineers
who
built
the
madeira
marmore
railroad
a
work
which
stands
honorably
distinguished
among
the
many
great
and
useful
works
done
in
the
development
of
the
tropics
of
recent
years
amilcar
which
were
nearly
worn
out
had
been
left
in
these
fertile
pastures
most
of
the
fresh
oxen
which
he
took
in
their
places
were
unbroken
and
there
was
a
perfect
circus
before
they
were
packed
and
marched
off
in
every
direction
said
the
gleeful
narrators
there
were
bucking
oxen
and
loads
strewed
on
the
ground
this
cattle
ranch
is
managed
by
the
colonel
uncle
his
brother
a
hale
old
man
of
seventy
but
as
active
and
vigorous
as
ever
with
a
fine
kindly
intelligent
face
his
name
is
miguel
evangalista
he
is
a
native
of
matto
grosso
of
practically
pure
indian
blood
and
was
dressed
in
the
ordinary
costume
of
the
caboclo
hat
shirt
trousers
and
no
shoes
or
stockings
within
the
last
year
he
had
killed
three
jaguars
which
had
been
living
on
the
mules
as
long
as
they
could
get
mules
they
did
not
at
this
station
molest
the
cattle
it
was
with
this
uncle
father
colonel
rondon
own
grandfather
that
colonel
rondon
as
an
orphan
spent
the
first
seven
years
of
his
life
his
father
died
before
he
was
born
and
his
mother
when
he
was
only
a
year
old
he
lived
on
his
grandfather
some
fifty
miles
from
cuyaba
then
he
went
to
live
in
cuyaba
with
a
kinsman
on
his
father
side
from
whom
he
took
the
name
of
rondon
his
own
father
name
was
dasilva
he
studied
in
the
cuyaba
government
school
and
at
sixteen
was
inscribed
as
one
of
the
instructors
then
he
went
to
rio
served
for
a
year
in
the
army
as
an
enlisted
man
in
the
ranks
and
succeeded
finally
in
getting
into
the
military
school
after
five
years
as
pupil
he
served
three
years
as
professor
of
mathematics
in
this
school
and
then
as
a
lieutenant
of
engineers
in
the
brazilian
army
he
came
back
to
his
home
in
matto
grosso
and
began
his
of
exploring
the
wilderness
next
day
we
journeyed
to
the
telegraph
station
at
bonofacio
through
alternate
spells
of
glaring
sunshine
and
heavy
rain
on
the
way
we
stopped
at
an
of
nhambiquaras
we
first
met
a
couple
of
men
going
to
hunt
with
bows
and
arrows
longer
than
themselves
a
rather
comely
young
woman
carrying
on
her
back
a
wickerwork
basket
or
creel
supported
by
a
forehead
band
and
accompanied
by
a
small
child
was
with
them
at
the
village
there
were
a
number
of
men
women
and
children
although
as
completely
naked
as
the
others
we
had
met
the
members
of
this
band
were
more
ornamented
with
beads
and
wore
earrings
made
from
the
inside
of
or
very
big
shells
they
were
more
hairy
than
the
ones
we
had
so
far
met
the
women
but
not
the
men
completely
remove
the
hair
from
their
bodies
and
look
more
instead
of
less
indecent
in
consequence
the
chief
whose
body
was
painted
red
with
the
juice
of
a
fruit
had
what
could
fairly
be
styled
a
mustache
and
imperial
and
one
old
man
looked
somewhat
like
a
hairy
ainu
or
perhaps
even
more
like
an
australian
black
fellow
my
companion
told
me
that
this
probably
represented
an
infusion
of
negro
blood
and
possibly
of
mulatto
blood
from
runaway
slaves
of
the
old
days
when
some
of
the
matto
grosso
mines
were
worked
by
slave
labor
they
also
thought
it
possible
that
this
infiltration
of
african
negroes
might
be
responsible
for
the
curious
shape
of
the
bigger
huts
which
were
utterly
unlike
their
flimsy
ordinary
shelters
and
bore
no
resemblance
in
shape
to
those
of
the
other
indian
tribes
of
this
region
whereas
they
were
not
unlike
the
ordinary
beehive
huts
of
the
agricultural
african
negroes
there
were
in
this
village
several
huts
or
shelters
open
at
the
sides
and
two
of
the
big
huts
these
were
of
closely
woven
thatch
circular
in
outline
with
a
rounded
dome
and
two
doors
a
couple
of
feet
high
opposite
each
other
and
no
other
opening
there
were
fifteen
or
twenty
people
to
each
hut
inside
were
their
implements
and
utensils
such
as
wicker
baskets
some
of
them
filled
with
pineapples
gourds
wooden
knives
wooden
mortars
and
a
board
for
grating
mandioc
made
of
a
thick
slab
of
wood
inset
with
sharp
points
of
a
harder
wood
from
the
brazilians
one
or
two
of
them
had
obtained
blankets
and
one
a
hammock
and
they
had
also
obtained
knives
which
they
sorely
needed
for
they
are
not
even
in
the
stone
age
one
woman
shielded
herself
from
the
rain
by
holding
a
green
down
her
back
another
had
on
her
head
what
we
at
first
thought
to
be
a
dress
but
it
was
a
little
live
black
monkey
it
stayed
habitually
with
its
head
above
her
forehead
and
its
arms
and
legs
spread
so
that
it
lay
moulded
to
the
shape
of
her
head
but
both
woman
and
monkey
showed
some
reluctance
about
having
their
photographs
taken
bonofacio
consisted
of
several
thatched
cabins
connected
by
a
stockade
which
was
extended
to
form
an
enclosure
behind
them
a
number
of
tame
parrots
and
parakeets
of
several
different
species
scrambled
over
the
roofs
and
entered
the
houses
in
the
open
pastures
near
by
were
the
curious
extensive
burrows
of
a
gopher
rat
which
ate
the
roots
of
grass
not
emerging
to
eat
the
grass
but
pulling
it
into
the
burrows
by
the
roots
these
burrows
bore
a
close
likeness
to
those
of
our
pocket
gophers
miller
found
the
animals
difficult
to
trap
finally
by
the
aid
of
colonel
rondon
several
indians
and
two
or
three
of
our
men
he
dug
one
out
from
the
central
shaft
several
surface
galleries
radiated
running
for
many
rods
about
a
foot
below
the
surface
with
at
intervals
of
half
a
dozen
yards
mounds
where
the
loose
earth
had
been
expelled
the
central
shaft
ran
straight
down
for
about
eight
feet
and
then
laterally
for
about
fifteen
feet
to
a
kind
of
chamber
the
animal
dug
hard
to
escape
but
when
taken
and
put
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
it
moved
slowly
and
awkwardly
it
showed
vicious
courage
in
looks
it
closely
resembled
our
pocket
gophers
but
it
had
no
pockets
this
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
small
mammals
that
we
secured
after
breakfast
at
bonofacio
a
number
of
nhambiquaras
men
women
and
children
strolled
in
the
men
gave
us
an
exhibition
of
not
very
good
archery
when
the
bow
was
bent
it
was
at
first
held
so
that
the
arrow
pointed
straight
upwards
and
was
then
lowered
so
that
the
arrow
was
aimed
at
the
target
several
of
the
women
had
been
taken
from
other
tribes
after
their
husbands
or
fathers
had
been
killed
for
the
nhambiquaras
are
robbers
and
murderers
two
or
three
miserable
dogs
accompanied
them
and
mangy
but
each
decorated
with
a
collar
of
beads
the
headmen
had
three
or
four
wives
apiece
and
the
women
were
the
but
apparently
were
not
badly
treated
most
of
them
were
dirty
although
looking
and
their
features
were
of
a
low
type
but
some
especially
among
the
children
were
quite
attractive
from
bonofacio
we
went
about
seven
miles
across
a
rolling
prairie
dotted
with
trees
and
clumps
of
shrub
there
on
february
we
joined
amilcar
who
was
camped
by
a
brook
which
flowed
into
the
duvida
we
were
only
some
six
miles
from
our
place
of
embarkation
on
the
duvida
and
we
divided
our
party
and
our
belongings
amilcar
miller
mello
and
oliveira
were
to
march
three
days
to
the
and
then
descend
it
and
continue
down
the
madeira
to
manaos
rondon
lyra
the
doctor
cherrie
kermit
and
i
with
sixteen
paddlers
in
seven
canoes
were
to
descend
the
duvida
and
find
out
whether
it
led
into
the
our
purpose
was
to
return
and
descend
the
ananas
whose
outlet
was
also
unknown
having
this
in
view
we
left
a
fortnight
provisions
for
our
party
of
six
at
bonofacio
we
took
with
us
provisions
for
about
fifty
days
not
full
rations
for
we
hoped
in
part
to
live
on
the
country
on
fish
game
nuts
and
our
personal
baggage
was
already
well
cut
down
cherrie
kermit
and
i
took
the
naturalist
fly
to
sleep
under
and
a
very
light
little
tent
extra
for
any
one
who
might
fall
sick
rondon
lyra
and
the
doctor
took
one
of
their
own
tents
the
things
that
we
carried
were
necessities
food
medicines
bedding
instruments
for
determining
the
altitude
and
longitude
and
latitude
except
a
few
books
each
in
small
compass
lyra
were
in
german
consisting
of
two
tiny
volumes
of
goethe
and
schiller
kermit
were
in
portuguese
mine
all
in
english
included
the
last
two
volumes
of
gibbon
the
plays
of
sophocles
more
utopia
marcus
aurelius
and
epictetus
the
two
latter
lent
me
by
a
friend
major
shipton
of
the
regulars
our
military
attaché
at
buenos
aires
if
our
canoe
voyage
was
prosperous
we
would
gradually
lighten
the
loads
by
eating
the
provisions
if
we
met
with
accidents
such
as
losing
canoes
and
men
in
the
rapids
or
losing
men
in
encounters
with
indians
or
if
we
encountered
overmuch
fever
and
dysentery
the
loads
would
lighten
themselves
we
were
all
armed
we
took
no
cartridges
for
sport
cherrie
had
some
to
be
used
sparingly
for
collecting
specimens
the
others
were
to
be
used
unless
in
the
unlikely
event
of
having
to
repel
an
attack
only
to
procure
food
the
food
and
the
arms
we
carried
represented
all
reasonable
precautions
against
suffering
and
starvation
but
of
course
if
the
course
of
the
river
proved
very
long
and
difficult
if
we
lost
our
boats
over
falls
or
in
rapids
or
had
to
make
too
many
and
too
long
portages
or
were
brought
to
a
halt
by
impassable
swamps
then
we
would
have
to
reckon
with
starvation
as
a
possibility
anything
might
happen
we
were
about
to
go
into
the
unknown
and
no
one
could
say
what
it
held
note
the
first
four
days
before
we
struck
the
upper
rapids
and
during
which
we
made
nearly
seventy
kilometres
are
of
course
not
included
when
i
speak
of
our
making
our
way
down
the
rapids
i
hope
that
this
year
the
ananas
or
pineapple
will
also
be
put
on
the
map
one
of
colonel
rondon
subordinates
is
to
attempt
the
descent
of
the
river
we
passed
the
headwaters
of
the
pineapple
on
the
high
plateau
very
possibly
we
passed
its
mouth
although
it
is
also
possible
that
it
empties
into
the
canama
or
tapajos
but
it
will
not
be
put
on
the
map
until
some
one
descends
and
finds
out
where
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
really
does
go
it
would
be
well
if
a
geographical
society
of
standing
would
investigate
the
formal
and
official
charges
made
by
colonel
rondon
an
officer
and
gentleman
of
the
highest
repute
against
savage
landor
colonel
rondon
in
an
official
report
to
the
brazilian
government
has
written
a
scathing
review
of
landor
he
states
that
savage
landor
did
not
perform
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
perform
the
work
he
had
contracted
to
do
in
exploration
for
the
brazilian
government
landor
had
asserted
and
promised
that
he
would
go
through
unknown
country
along
the
line
of
eleven
degrees
latitude
south
and
as
colonel
rondon
states
it
was
because
of
this
proposal
of
his
that
the
brazilian
government
gave
him
material
financial
assistance
in
advance
however
colonel
rondon
sets
forth
that
landor
did
not
keep
his
word
or
make
any
serious
effort
to
fulfil
his
moral
obligation
to
do
as
he
had
said
he
would
do
in
a
letter
to
me
under
date
of
may
a
letter
which
has
been
published
in
full
in
france
colonel
rondon
goes
at
length
into
the
question
of
what
territory
landor
had
traversed
colonel
rondon
states
that
excepting
on
one
occasion
when
landor
wandering
off
a
beaten
trail
immediately
got
lost
and
shortly
returned
to
his
without
making
any
discoveries
he
kept
to
old
travelled
routes
one
sentence
of
the
colonel
letter
to
me
runs
as
follows
i
can
guarantee
to
you
that
in
brazil
landor
did
not
cross
a
hand
breadth
of
land
that
had
not
been
explored
the
greater
part
of
it
many
centuries
ago
as
regards
landor
sole
and
brief
experience
in
leaving
a
beaten
route
colonel
rondon
states
that
at
sao
manoel
landor
engaged
from
senhor
jose
sotero
barreto
the
revenue
officer
of
matto
grosso
at
sao
manoel
a
guide
to
lead
him
across
a
trail
which
connects
the
tapajos
with
the
madeira
via
the
canama
the
guide
however
got
lost
and
after
a
few
days
they
all
returned
to
the
point
of
departure
instead
of
going
through
to
the
canama
senhor
barreto
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
related
this
last
incident
to
fiala
when
fiala
descended
the
tapajos
and
by
the
way
fiala
trip
down
the
papagaio
juruena
and
tapajos
was
infinitely
more
important
than
all
the
work
landor
did
in
south
america
put
together
lieutenants
pyrineus
and
mello
mentioned
in
the
body
of
this
work
informed
me
that
they
accompanied
landor
on
most
of
his
overland
trip
before
he
embarked
on
the
arinos
and
that
he
simply
followed
the
highroad
or
else
the
and
furthermore
colonel
rondon
states
that
the
indians
whom
landor
encountered
and
photographed
were
those
educated
at
the
missions
colonel
rondon
official
report
to
the
brazilian
government
and
his
letter
to
me
are
of
interest
to
all
geographers
and
other
scientific
men
who
have
any
concern
with
the
alleged
discoveries
of
landor
they
contain
very
grave
charges
with
which
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
deal
suffice
it
to
say
that
landor
accounts
of
his
alleged
exploration
can
not
be
considered
as
entitled
to
the
slightest
serious
consideration
until
he
has
satisfactorily
and
in
detail
answered
colonel
rondon
and
this
he
has
thus
far
signally
failed
to
do
fortunately
there
are
numerous
examples
of
exactly
the
opposite
type
of
work
from
the
days
of
humboldt
and
spix
and
martius
to
the
present
time
german
explorers
have
borne
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
exploration
of
south
america
as
representatives
of
the
men
and
women
who
have
done
such
capital
work
who
have
fronted
every
hazard
and
hardship
and
labored
in
the
scientific
spirit
and
who
have
added
greatly
to
our
fund
of
geographic
biologic
and
ethnographic
knowledge
i
may
mention

the
river
of
doubt
on
february
shortly
after
midday
we
started
down
the
river
of
doubt
into
the
unknown
we
were
quite
uncertain
whether
after
a
week
we
should
find
ourselves
in
the
or
after
six
weeks
in
the
madeira
or
after
three
months
we
knew
not
where
that
was
why
the
river
was
rightly
christened
the
duvida
we
had
been
camped
close
to
the
river
where
the
trail
that
follows
the
telegraph
line
crosses
it
by
a
rough
bridge
as
our
laden
dugouts
swung
into
the
stream
amilcar
and
miller
and
all
the
others
of
the
party
were
on
the
banks
and
the
bridge
to
wave
farewell
and
wish
us
and
good
luck
it
was
the
height
of
the
rainy
season
and
the
swollen
torrent
was
swift
and
brown
our
camp
was
at
about
degrees
minute
latitude
south
and
degrees
minutes
longitude
west
of
greenwich
our
general
course
was
to
be
northward
toward
the
equator
by
waterway
through
the
vast
forest
we
had
seven
canoes
all
of
them
dugouts
one
was
small
one
was
cranky
and
two
were
old
waterlogged
and
leaky
the
other
three
were
good
the
two
old
canoes
were
lashed
together
and
the
cranky
one
was
lashed
to
one
of
the
others
kermit
with
two
paddlers
went
in
the
smallest
of
the
good
canoes
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
with
three
other
paddlers
in
the
next
largest
and
the
doctor
cherrie
and
i
in
the
largest
with
three
paddlers
the
remaining
eight
camaradas
there
were
sixteen
in
all
were
equally
divided
between
our
two
pairs
of
lashed
canoes
although
our
personal
baggage
was
cut
down
to
the
limit
necessary
for
health
and
efficiency
yet
on
such
a
trip
as
ours
where
scientific
work
has
to
be
done
and
where
food
for
men
for
an
unknown
period
of
time
has
to
be
carried
it
is
impossible
not
to
take
a
good
deal
of
stuff
and
the
seven
dugouts
were
too
heavily
laden
the
paddlers
were
a
strapping
set
they
were
expert
rivermen
and
men
of
the
forest
skilled
veterans
in
wilderness
work
they
were
lithe
as
panthers
and
brawny
as
bears
they
swam
like
waterdogs
they
were
equally
at
home
with
pole
and
paddle
with
axe
and
machete
and
one
was
a
good
cook
and
others
were
good
men
around
camp
they
looked
like
pirates
in
the
pictures
of
howard
pyle
or
maxfield
parrish
one
or
two
of
them
were
pirates
and
one
worse
than
a
pirate
but
most
of
them
were
willing
and
cheerful
they
were
white
or
rather
the
olive
of
southern
europe
black
and
of
all
intermediate
shades
in
my
canoe
luiz
the
steersman
the
headman
was
a
matto
grosso
negro
julio
the
bowsman
was
from
bahia
and
of
pure
portuguese
blood
and
the
third
man
antonio
was
a
parecis
indian
the
actual
surveying
of
the
river
was
done
by
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
with
kermit
as
their
assistant
kermit
went
first
in
his
little
canoe
with
the
on
which
two
disks
one
red
and
one
white
were
placed
a
metre
apart
he
selected
a
place
which
commanded
as
long
vistas
as
possible
and
down
and
which
therefore
might
be
at
the
angle
of
a
bend
landed
cut
away
the
branches
which
obstructed
the
view
and
set
up
the
incidentally
encountering
maribundi
wasps
and
swarms
of
biting
and
stinging
ants
lyra
from
his
station
with
his
telemetre
established
the
distance
while
colonel
rondon
with
the
compass
took
the
direction
and
made
the
records
then
they
moved
on
to
the
point
kermit
had
left
and
kermit
established
a
new
point
within
their
sight
the
first
work
was
slow
the
general
course
of
the
stream
was
a
trifle
east
of
north
but
at
short
intervals
it
bent
and
curved
literally
toward
every
point
of
the
compass
kermit
landed
nearly
a
hundred
times
and
we
made
but
nine
and
a
third
kilometres
my
canoe
ran
ahead
of
the
surveying
canoes
the
height
of
the
water
made
the
going
easy
for
most
of
the
snags
and
fallen
trees
were
well
beneath
the
surface
now
and
then
however
the
swift
water
hurried
us
toward
ripples
that
marked
ugly
spikes
of
sunken
timber
or
toward
uprooted
trees
that
stretched
almost
across
the
stream
then
the
muscles
stood
out
on
the
backs
and
arms
of
the
paddlers
as
stroke
on
stroke
they
urged
us
away
from
and
past
the
obstacle
if
the
leaning
or
fallen
trees
were
the
thorny
boritana
palms
which
love
the
wet
they
were
often
although
plunged
beneath
the
river
in
full
and
vigorous
growth
their
stems
curving
upward
and
their
crowned
tops
shaken
by
the
rushing
water
it
was
interesting
work
for
no
civilized
man
no
white
man
had
ever
gone
down
or
up
this
river
or
seen
the
country
through
which
we
were
passing
the
lofty
and
matted
forest
rose
like
a
green
wall
on
either
hand
the
trees
were
stately
and
beautiful
the
looped
and
twisted
vines
hung
from
them
like
great
ropes
masses
of
epiphytes
grew
both
on
the
dead
trees
and
the
living
some
had
huge
leaves
like
elephants
ears
now
and
then
fragrant
scents
were
blown
to
us
from
flowers
on
the
banks
there
were
not
many
birds
and
for
the
most
part
the
forest
was
silent
rarely
we
heard
strange
calls
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
or
saw
a
cormorant
or
ibis
my
canoe
ran
only
a
couple
of
hours
then
we
halted
to
wait
for
the
others
after
a
couple
of
hours
more
as
the
surveyors
had
not
turned
up
we
landed
and
made
camp
at
a
spot
where
the
bank
rose
sharply
for
a
hundred
yards
to
a
level
stretch
of
ground
our
canoes
were
moored
to
trees
the
axemen
cleared
a
space
for
the
tents
they
were
pitched
the
baggage
was
brought
up
and
fires
were
kindled
the
woods
were
almost
soundless
through
them
ran
old
tapir
trails
but
there
was
no
fresh
sign
before
nightfall
the
surveyors
arrived
there
were
a
few
piums
and
gnats
and
a
few
mosquitoes
after
dark
but
not
enough
to
make
us
uncomfortable
the
small
stingless
bees
of
slightly
aromatic
odor
swarmed
while
daylight
lasted
and
crawled
over
our
faces
and
hands
they
were
such
tame
harmless
little
things
that
when
they
tickled
too
much
i
always
tried
to
brush
them
away
without
hurting
them
but
they
became
a
great
nuisance
after
a
while
it
had
been
raining
at
intervals
and
the
weather
was
overcast
but
after
the
sun
went
down
the
sky
cleared
the
stars
were
brilliant
overhead
and
the
new
moon
hung
in
the
west
it
was
a
pleasant
night
the
air
almost
cool
and
we
slept
soundly
next
morning
the
two
surveying
canoes
left
immediately
after
breakfast
an
hour
later
the
two
pairs
of
lashed
canoes
pushed
off
i
kept
our
canoe
to
let
cherrie
collect
for
in
the
early
hours
we
could
hear
a
number
of
birds
in
the
woods
near
by
the
most
interesting
birds
he
shot
were
a
cotinga
brilliant
with
a
purple
throat
and
a
big
woodpecker
black
above
and
cinnamon
below
with
an
entirely
red
head
and
neck
it
was
almost
noon
before
we
started
we
saw
a
few
more
birds
there
were
fresh
tapir
and
paca
tracks
at
one
point
where
we
landed
once
we
heard
howler
monkeys
from
the
depth
of
the
forest
and
once
we
saw
a
big
otter
in
midstream
as
we
drifted
and
paddled
down
the
swirling
brown
current
through
the
vivid
green
of
the
tropic
forest
the
trees
leaned
over
the
river
from
both
banks
when
those
that
had
fallen
in
the
river
at
some
narrow
point
were
very
tall
or
where
it
happened
that
two
fell
opposite
each
other
they
formed
barriers
which
the
men
in
the
leading
canoes
cleared
with
their
axes
there
were
many
palms
both
the
burity
with
its
stiff
fronds
like
enormous
fans
and
a
handsome
species
of
bacaba
with
very
long
gracefully
curving
fronds
in
places
the
palms
stood
close
together
towering
and
slender
their
stems
a
stately
colonnade
their
fronds
an
arched
fretwork
against
the
sky
butterflies
of
many
hues
fluttered
over
the
river
the
day
was
overcast
with
showers
of
rain
when
the
sun
broke
through
rifts
in
the
clouds
his
shafts
turned
the
forest
to
gold
in
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
big
and
swift
affluent
entering
from
the
right
it
was
undoubtedly
the
bandeira
which
we
had
crossed
well
toward
its
head
some
ten
days
before
on
our
road
to
bonofacio
the
nhambiquaras
had
then
told
colonel
rondon
that
it
flowed
into
the
duvida
after
its
junction
with
the
added
volume
of
water
the
river
widened
without
losing
its
depth
it
was
so
high
that
it
had
overflowed
and
stood
among
the
trees
on
the
lower
levels
only
the
higher
stretches
were
dry
on
the
sheer
banks
where
we
landed
we
had
to
push
the
canoes
for
yards
or
rods
through
the
branches
of
the
submerged
trees
hacking
and
hewing
there
were
occasional
bays
and
from
which
the
current
had
shifted
in
these
the
coarse
marsh
grass
grew
tall
this
evening
we
made
camp
on
a
flat
of
dry
ground
densely
wooded
of
course
directly
on
the
edge
of
the
river
and
five
feet
above
it
it
was
fine
to
see
the
speed
and
sinewy
ease
with
which
the
choppers
cleared
an
open
space
for
the
tents
next
morning
when
we
bathed
before
sunrise
we
dived
into
deep
water
right
from
the
shore
and
from
the
moored
canoes
this
second
day
we
made
sixteen
and
a
half
kilometres
along
the
course
of
the
river
and
nine
kilometres
in
a
straight
line
almost
due
north
the
following
day
march
there
was
much
rain
sometimes
showers
sometimes
vertical
sheets
of
water
our
course
was
somewhat
west
of
north
and
we
made
twenty
and
a
half
kilometres
we
passed
signs
of
indian
habitation
there
were
abandoned
shelters
on
both
banks
on
the
left
bank
we
came
to
two
or
three
old
indian
fields
grown
up
with
coarse
fern
and
studded
with
the
burned
skeletons
of
trees
at
the
mouth
of
a
brook
which
entered
from
the
right
some
sticks
stood
in
the
water
marking
the
site
of
an
old
at
one
point
we
found
the
tough
vine
of
an
indian
bridge
running
right
across
the
river
a
couple
of
feet
above
it
evidently
the
bridge
had
been
built
at
low
water
three
stout
poles
had
been
driven
into
the
in
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
current
the
bridge
had
consisted
of
poles
fastened
to
these
supports
leading
between
them
and
from
the
support
at
each
end
to
the
banks
the
rope
of
tough
vines
had
been
stretched
as
a
necessary
with
such
precarious
footing
the
rise
of
the
river
had
swept
away
the
bridge
but
the
props
and
the
rope
remained
in
the
afternoon
from
the
boat
cherrie
shot
a
large
monkey
with
a
prehensile
tail
it
was
very
good
eating
we
camped
on
a
dry
level
space
but
a
few
feet
above
and
close
beside
the
river
so
that
our
was
handy
the
trees
were
cleared
and
camp
was
made
with
orderly
hurry
one
of
the
men
almost
stepped
on
a
poisonous
which
would
have
been
a
serious
thing
as
his
feet
were
bare
but
i
had
on
stout
shoes
and
the
fangs
of
these
serpents
unlike
those
of
the
are
too
short
to
penetrate
good
leather
i
promptly
put
my
foot
on
him
and
he
bit
my
shoe
with
harmless
venom
it
has
been
said
that
the
brilliant
hues
of
the
when
in
its
native
haunts
really
confer
on
it
a
concealing
coloration
in
the
dark
and
tangled
woods
and
to
an
only
less
extent
in
the
ordinary
varied
landscape
anything
motionless
especially
if
partially
hidden
easily
eludes
the
eye
but
against
the
mould
of
the
forest
floor
on
which
we
found
this
snake
its
bright
and
varied
coloration
was
distinctly
revealing
infinitely
more
so
than
the
duller
mottling
of
the
jararaca
and
other
dangerous
snakes
of
the
genus
lachecis
in
the
same
place
however
we
found
a
striking
example
of
genuine
protective
or
mimetic
coloration
and
shape
a
rather
large
insect
larva
at
least
we
judged
it
to
be
a
larval
form
but
we
were
none
of
us
entomologists
bore
a
resemblance
to
a
partially
curled
dry
leaf
which
was
fairly
startling
the
tail
exactly
resembled
the
stem
or
continuation
of
the
midrib
of
the
dead
leaf
the
flattened
body
was
curled
up
at
the
sides
and
veined
and
colored
precisely
like
the
leaf
the
head
colored
like
the
leaf
projected
in
front
we
were
still
in
the
brazilian
highlands
the
forest
did
not
teem
with
life
it
was
generally
rather
silent
we
did
not
hear
such
a
chorus
of
birds
and
mammals
as
we
had
occasionally
heard
even
on
our
overland
journey
when
more
than
once
we
had
been
awakened
at
dawn
by
the
howling
screaming
yelping
and
chattering
of
monkeys
toucans
macaws
parrots
and
parakeets
there
were
however
from
time
to
time
queer
sounds
from
the
forest
and
after
nightfall
different
kinds
of
frogs
and
insects
uttered
strange
cries
and
calls
in
volume
and
frequency
these
seemed
to
increase
until
midnight
then
they
died
away
and
before
dawn
everything
was
silent
at
this
camp
the
carregadores
ants
completely
devoured
the
undershirt
and
ate
holes
in
his
and
they
also
ate
the
strap
of
lyra
the
little
stingless
bees
of
many
kinds
swarmed
in
such
multitudes
and
were
so
persevering
that
we
had
to
wear
our
when
we
wrote
or
skinned
specimens
the
following
day
was
almost
without
rain
it
was
delightful
to
drift
and
paddle
slowly
down
the
beautiful
tropical
river
until
afternoon
the
current
was
not
very
fast
and
the
broad
deep
placid
stream
bent
and
curved
in
every
direction
although
the
general
course
was
northwest
the
country
was
flat
and
more
of
the
land
was
under
than
above
water
continually
we
found
ourselves
travelling
between
stretches
of
marshy
forest
where
for
miles
the
water
stood
or
ran
among
the
trees
once
we
passed
a
hillock
we
saw
brilliantly
colored
parakeets
and
trogons
at
last
the
slow
current
quickened
faster
it
went
and
faster
until
it
began
to
run
like
a
and
we
heard
the
roar
of
rapids
ahead
we
pulled
to
the
right
bank
moored
the
canoes
and
while
most
of
the
men
pitched
camp
two
or
three
of
them
accompanied
us
to
examine
the
rapids
we
had
made
twenty
kilometres
we
soon
found
that
the
rapids
were
a
serious
obstacle
there
were
many
curls
and
one
or
two
regular
falls
perhaps
six
feet
high
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
run
them
and
they
stretched
for
nearly
a
mile
the
carry
however
which
led
through
woods
and
over
rocks
in
a
nearly
straight
line
was
somewhat
shorter
it
was
not
an
easy
portage
over
which
to
carry
heavy
loads
and
drag
heavy
dugout
canoes
at
the
point
where
the
descent
was
steepest
there
were
great
naked
flats
of
friable
sandstone
and
conglomerate
over
parts
of
these
where
there
was
a
surface
of
fine
sand
there
was
a
growth
of
coarse
grass
other
parts
were
bare
and
had
been
worn
by
the
weather
into
fantastic
shapes
one
projection
looked
like
an
beaver
hat
upside
down
in
this
place
where
the
naked
flats
of
rock
showed
the
projection
of
the
ledge
through
which
the
river
had
cut
its
course
the
torrent
rushed
down
a
deep
and
extremely
narrow
channel
at
one
point
it
was
less
than
two
yards
across
and
for
quite
a
distance
not
more
than
five
or
six
yards
yet
only
a
mile
or
two
above
the
rapids
the
deep
placid
river
was
at
least
a
hundred
yards
wide
it
seemed
extraordinary
almost
impossible
that
so
broad
a
river
could
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
contract
its
dimensions
to
the
width
of
the
strangled
channel
through
which
it
now
poured
its
entire
volume
this
has
for
long
been
a
station
where
the
nhambiquaras
at
intervals
built
their
ephemeral
villages
and
tilled
the
soil
with
the
rude
and
destructive
cultivation
of
savages
there
were
several
abandoned
old
fields
where
the
dense
growth
of
rank
fern
hid
the
tangle
of
burnt
and
fallen
logs
nor
had
the
nhambiquaras
been
long
absent
in
one
trail
we
found
what
gypsies
would
have
called
a
pateran
a
couple
of
branches
arranged
crosswise
eight
leaves
to
a
branch
it
had
some
special
significance
belonging
to
that
class
of
signals
each
with
some
peculiar
and
often
complicated
meaning
which
are
commonly
used
by
many
wild
peoples
the
indians
had
thrown
a
simple
bridge
consisting
of
four
long
poles
without
a
across
one
of
the
narrowest
parts
of
the
rock
gorge
through
which
the
river
foamed
in
its
rapid
descent
this
of
indians
was
called
the
navaite
we
named
the
rapids
after
them
navaite
rapids
by
observation
lyra
found
them
to
be
in
close
approximation
to
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
longitude
degrees
minutes
west
from
greenwich
we
spent
march
and
and
the
morning
of
the
in
portaging
around
the
rapids
the
first
night
we
camped
in
the
forest
beside
the
spot
where
we
had
halted
next
morning
we
moved
the
baggage
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
where
we
intended
to
launch
the
canoes
and
pitched
our
tents
on
the
open
sandstone
flat
it
rained
heavily
the
little
bees
were
in
such
swarms
as
to
be
a
nuisance
many
small
stinging
bees
were
with
them
which
stung
badly
we
were
bitten
by
huge
the
size
of
bumblebees
more
serious
annoyance
was
caused
by
the
pium
and
boroshuda
flies
during
the
hours
of
daylight
and
by
the
polvora
the
after
dark
there
were
a
few
mosquitoes
the
boroshudas
were
the
worst
pests
they
brought
the
blood
at
once
and
left
marks
that
lasted
for
weeks
i
did
my
writing
in
and
gauntlets
fortunately
we
had
with
us
several
bottles
of
fly
dope
so
named
on
the
label
put
up
with
the
rest
of
our
medicine
by
doctor
alexander
lambert
he
had
tested
it
in
the
north
woods
and
found
it
excellent
i
had
never
before
been
forced
to
use
such
an
ointment
and
had
been
reluctant
to
take
it
with
me
but
now
i
was
glad
enough
to
have
it
and
we
all
of
us
found
it
exceedingly
useful
i
would
never
again
go
into
mosquito
or
country
without
it
the
effect
of
an
application
wears
off
after
half
an
hour
or
so
and
under
many
conditions
as
when
one
is
perspiring
freely
it
is
of
no
use
but
there
are
times
when
minute
mosquitoes
and
gnats
get
through
and
under
and
when
the
ointments
occasionally
renewed
may
permit
one
to
get
sleep
or
rest
which
would
otherwise
be
impossible
of
attainment
the
termites
got
into
our
tent
on
the
flat
ate
holes
in
cherrie
and
poncho
and
were
starting
to
work
at
our
when
we
discovered
them
packing
the
loads
across
was
simple
dragging
the
heavy
dugouts
was
labor
the
biggest
of
the
two
ones
was
the
heaviest
lyra
and
kermit
did
the
job
all
the
men
were
employed
at
it
except
the
cook
and
one
man
who
was
down
with
fever
a
road
was
chopped
through
the
forest
and
a
couple
of
hundred
stout
poles
or
small
logs
were
cut
as
rollers
and
placed
about
two
yards
apart
with
block
and
tackle
the
seven
dugouts
were
hoisted
out
of
the
river
up
the
steep
banks
and
up
the
rise
of
ground
until
the
level
was
reached
then
the
men
harnessed
themselves
two
by
two
on
the
while
one
of
their
number
pried
behind
with
a
lever
and
the
canoe
bumping
and
sliding
was
twitched
through
the
woods
over
the
sandstone
flats
there
were
some
ugly
ledges
but
on
the
whole
the
course
was
and
relatively
easy
looking
at
the
way
the
work
was
done
at
the
the
endurance
and
the
strength
of
the
camaradas
and
at
the
intelligence
and
the
unwearied
efforts
of
their
commanders
one
could
but
wonder
at
the
ignorance
of
those
who
do
not
realize
the
energy
and
the
power
that
are
so
often
possessed
by
and
that
may
be
so
readily
developed
in
the
men
of
the
tropics
another
subject
of
perpetual
wonder
is
the
attitude
of
certain
men
who
stay
at
home
and
still
more
the
attitude
of
certain
men
who
travel
under
easy
conditions
and
who
belittle
the
achievements
of
the
real
explorers
of
the
real
adventures
in
the
great
wilderness
the
impostors
and
romancers
among
explorers
or
explorers
and
wilderness
wanderers
have
been
unusually
prominent
in
connection
with
south
america
although
the
conspicuous
ones
are
not
south
americans
by
the
way
and
these
are
fit
subjects
for
condemnation
and
derision
but
the
work
of
the
genuine
explorer
and
wilderness
wanderer
is
fraught
with
fatigue
hardship
and
danger
many
of
the
men
of
little
knowledge
talk
glibly
of
portaging
as
if
it
were
simple
and
easy
a
portage
over
rough
and
unknown
ground
is
always
a
work
of
difficulty
and
of
some
risk
to
the
canoe
and
in
the
untrodden
or
even
in
the
unfrequented
wilderness
risk
to
the
canoe
is
a
serious
matter
this
particular
portage
at
navaite
rapids
was
far
from
being
unusually
difficult
yet
it
not
only
cost
two
and
a
half
days
of
severe
and
incessant
labor
but
it
cost
something
in
damage
to
the
canoes
one
in
particular
the
one
in
which
i
had
been
journeying
was
split
in
a
manner
which
caused
us
serious
uneasiness
as
to
how
long
even
after
being
patched
it
would
last
where
the
canoes
were
launched
the
bank
was
sheer
and
one
of
the
canoes
filled
and
went
to
the
bottom
and
there
was
more
work
in
raising
it
we
were
still
wholly
unable
to
tell
where
we
were
going
or
what
lay
ahead
of
us
round
the
after
supper
we
held
endless
discussions
and
hazarded
all
kinds
of
guesses
on
both
subjects
the
river
might
bend
sharply
to
the
west
and
enter
the
high
up
or
low
down
or
go
north
to
the
madeira
or
bend
eastward
and
enter
the
tapajos
or
fall
into
the
canuma
and
finally
through
one
of
its
mouths
enter
the
amazon
direct
lyra
inclined
to
the
first
and
colonel
rondon
to
the
second
of
these
propositions
we
did
not
know
whether
we
had
one
hundred
or
eight
hundred
kilometres
to
go
whether
the
stream
would
be
fairly
smooth
or
whether
we
would
encounter
waterfalls
or
rapids
or
even
some
big
marsh
or
lake
we
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
we
would
meet
hostile
indians
although
no
one
of
us
ever
went
ten
yards
from
camp
without
his
rifle
we
had
no
idea
how
much
time
the
trip
would
take
we
had
entered
a
land
of
unknown
possibilities
we
started
again
early
in
the
afternoon
of
march
our
hands
and
faces
were
swollen
from
the
bites
and
stings
of
the
insect
pests
at
the
camp
and
it
was
a
pleasure
once
more
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
river
where
they
did
not
come
in
any
numbers
while
we
were
in
motion
the
current
was
swift
but
the
river
was
so
deep
that
there
were
no
serious
obstructions
twice
we
went
down
over
slight
riffles
which
in
the
dry
season
were
doubtless
rapids
and
once
we
struck
a
spot
where
many
whirlpools
marked
the
presence
underneath
of
boulders
which
would
have
been
above
water
had
not
the
river
been
so
swollen
by
the
rains
the
distance
we
covered
in
a
day
going
would
have
taken
us
a
week
if
we
had
been
going
up
the
course
wound
hither
and
thither
sometimes
in
sigmoid
curves
but
the
general
direction
was
east
of
north
as
usual
it
was
very
beautiful
and
we
never
could
tell
what
might
appear
around
any
curve
in
the
forest
that
rose
on
either
hand
were
tall
the
surveying
canoes
as
usual
went
first
while
i
shepherded
the
two
pairs
of
lashed
cargo
canoes
i
kept
them
always
between
me
and
the
surveying
canoes
ahead
of
me
until
i
passed
the
surveying
canoes
then
behind
me
until
after
an
hour
or
so
i
had
chosen
a
place
to
camp
there
was
so
much
overflowed
ground
that
it
took
us
some
little
time
this
afternoon
before
we
found
a
flat
place
high
enough
to
be
dry
just
before
reaching
camp
cherrie
shot
a
jacu
a
handsome
bird
somewhat
akin
to
but
much
smaller
than
a
turkey
after
cherrie
had
taken
its
skin
its
body
made
an
excellent
canja
we
saw
parties
of
monkeys
and
the
false
bellbirds
uttered
their
ringing
whistles
in
the
dense
timber
around
our
tents
the
giant
ants
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
were
rather
too
plentiful
around
this
camp
one
stung
kermit
it
was
almost
like
the
sting
of
a
small
scorpion
and
pained
severely
for
a
couple
of
hours
this
we
made
twelve
kilometres
on
the
following
day
we
made
nineteen
kilometres
the
river
twisting
in
every
direction
but
in
its
general
course
running
a
little
west
of
north
once
we
stopped
at
a
to
get
honey
the
tree
was
a
towering
giant
of
the
kind
called
because
a
thick
milky
juice
runs
freely
from
any
cut
our
camaradas
eagerly
drank
the
white
fluid
that
flowed
from
the
wounds
made
by
their
axes
i
tried
it
the
taste
was
not
unpleasant
but
it
left
a
sticky
feeling
in
the
mouth
the
helmsman
of
my
boat
luiz
a
powerful
negro
chopped
into
the
tree
balancing
himself
with
springy
ease
on
a
slight
scaffolding
the
honey
was
in
a
hollow
and
had
been
made
by
stingless
bees
at
the
mouth
of
the
hollow
they
had
built
a
curious
entrance
of
their
own
in
the
shape
of
a
spout
of
wax
about
a
foot
long
at
the
opening
the
walls
of
the
spout
showed
the
wax
formation
but
elsewhere
it
had
become
in
color
and
texture
indistinguishable
from
the
bark
of
the
tree
the
honey
was
delicious
sweet
and
yet
with
a
tart
flavor
the
comb
differed
much
from
that
of
our
the
were
very
large
and
the
which
were
small
were
in
a
single
instead
of
a
double
row
by
this
tree
i
came
across
an
example
of
genuine
concealing
coloration
a
huge
the
size
of
a
bullfrog
was
seated
upright
not
squatted
flat
on
a
big
rotten
limb
it
was
absolutely
motionless
the
yellow
brown
of
its
back
and
its
dark
sides
exactly
harmonized
in
color
with
the
light
and
dark
patches
on
the
log
the
color
was
as
concealing
here
in
its
natural
surroundings
as
is
the
color
of
our
common
among
the
dead
leaves
of
our
woods
when
i
stirred
it
up
it
jumped
to
a
small
twig
catching
hold
with
the
disks
of
its
and
balancing
itself
with
unexpected
ease
for
so
big
a
creature
and
then
hopped
to
the
ground
and
again
stood
motionless
evidently
it
trusted
for
safety
to
escaping
observation
we
saw
some
monkeys
and
fresh
tapir
sign
and
kermit
shot
a
jacu
for
the
pot
at
about
three
i
was
in
the
lead
when
the
current
began
to
run
more
quickly
we
passed
over
one
or
two
decided
ripples
and
then
heard
the
roar
of
rapids
ahead
while
the
stream
began
to
race
we
drove
the
canoe
into
the
bank
and
then
went
down
a
tapir
trail
which
led
alongside
the
river
to
reconnoiter
a
quarter
of
a
mile
walk
showed
us
that
there
were
big
rapids
down
which
the
canoes
could
not
go
and
we
returned
to
the
landing
all
the
canoes
had
gathered
there
and
rondon
lyra
and
kermit
started
to
explore
they
returned
in
an
hour
with
the
information
that
the
rapids
continued
for
a
long
distance
with
falls
and
steep
pitches
of
broken
water
and
that
the
portage
would
take
several
days
we
made
camp
just
above
the
rapids
ants
swarmed
and
some
of
them
bit
savagely
our
men
in
clearing
away
the
forest
for
our
tents
left
several
very
tall
and
slender
accashy
palms
the
bole
of
this
palm
is
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
is
crowned
with
delicate
gracefully
curved
fronds
we
had
come
along
the
course
of
the
river
almost
exactly
a
hundred
kilometres
it
had
twisted
so
that
we
were
only
about
kilometres
north
of
our
the
rock
was
porphyritic
the
and
we
spent
in
carrying
the
loads
and
dragging
and
floating
the
dugouts
past
the
series
of
rapids
at
whose
head
we
had
stopped
the
first
day
we
shifted
camp
a
kilometre
and
a
half
to
the
foot
of
this
series
of
rapids
this
was
a
charming
and
picturesque
camp
it
was
at
the
edge
of
the
river
where
there
was
a
little
shallow
bay
with
a
beach
of
firm
sand
in
the
water
at
the
middle
point
of
the
beach
stood
a
group
of
three
burity
palms
their
great
trunks
rising
like
columns
round
the
clearing
in
which
our
tents
stood
were
several
very
big
trees
two
of
them
were
kermit
went
five
or
six
kilometres
and
returned
having
shot
a
jacu
and
found
that
at
the
point
which
he
had
reached
there
was
another
rapids
almost
a
fall
which
would
necessitate
our
again
dragging
the
canoes
over
a
portage
antonio
the
parecis
shot
a
big
monkey
of
this
i
was
glad
because
portaging
is
hard
work
and
the
men
appreciated
the
meat
so
far
cherrie
had
collected
sixty
birds
on
the
duvida
all
of
them
new
to
the
collection
and
some
probably
new
to
science
we
saw
the
fresh
sign
of
paca
agouti
and
the
small
peccary
and
kermit
with
the
dogs
roused
a
tapir
which
crossed
the
river
right
through
the
rapids
but
no
one
got
a
shot
at
it
except
at
one
or
perhaps
two
points
a
very
big
dugout
lightly
loaded
could
probably
run
all
these
rapids
but
even
in
such
a
canoe
it
would
be
silly
to
make
the
attempt
on
an
exploring
expedition
where
the
loss
of
a
canoe
or
of
its
contents
means
disaster
and
moreover
such
a
canoe
could
not
be
taken
for
it
would
be
impossible
to
drag
it
over
the
portages
on
the
occasions
when
the
portages
became
inevitable
our
canoes
would
not
have
lived
half
a
minute
in
the
wild
water
on
the
second
day
the
canoes
and
loads
were
brought
down
to
the
foot
of
the
first
rapids
lyra
cleared
the
path
and
laid
the
logs
for
rollers
while
kermit
dragged
the
dugouts
up
the
bank
from
the
water
with
block
and
tackle
with
strain
of
rope
and
muscle
then
they
joined
forces
as
over
the
uneven
ground
it
needed
the
united
strength
of
all
their
men
to
get
the
heavy
dugouts
along
meanwhile
the
colonel
with
one
attendant
measured
the
distance
and
then
went
on
a
long
hunt
but
saw
no
game
i
strolled
down
beside
the
river
for
a
couple
of
miles
but
also
saw
nothing
in
the
dense
tropical
forest
of
the
amazonian
basin
hunting
is
very
difficult
especially
for
men
who
are
trying
to
pass
through
the
country
as
rapidly
as
possible
on
such
a
trip
as
ours
getting
game
is
largely
a
matter
of
chance
on
the
following
day
lyra
and
kermit
brought
down
the
canoes
and
loads
with
hard
labor
to
the
little
beach
by
the
three
palms
where
our
tents
were
pitched
many
pacovas
grew
round
about
the
men
used
their
immense
leaves
some
of
which
were
twelve
feet
long
and
two
and
a
half
feet
broad
to
roof
the
flimsy
shelters
under
which
they
hung
their
hammocks
i
went
into
the
woods
but
in
the
tangle
of
vegetation
it
would
have
been
a
mere
hazard
had
i
seen
any
big
animal
generally
the
woods
were
silent
and
empty
now
and
then
little
troops
of
birds
of
many
kinds
passed
tanagers
flycatchers
as
in
the
spring
and
fall
similar
troops
of
warblers
chickadees
and
nuthatches
pass
through
our
northern
woods
on
the
rocks
and
on
the
great
trees
by
the
river
grew
beautiful
white
and
lilac
orchids
the
sobralia
of
sweet
and
delicate
fragrance
for
the
moment
my
own
books
seemed
a
trifle
heavy
and
perhaps
i
would
have
found
the
day
tedious
if
kermit
had
not
lent
me
the
oxford
book
of
french
verse
eustache
deschamp
joachim
du
bellay
ronsard
the
delightful
la
fontaine
the
delightful
but
appalling
villon
victor
hugo
guitare
madame
lines
on
the
little
girl
and
her
pillow
as
dear
little
verses
about
a
child
as
ever
were
written
these
and
many
others
comforted
me
much
as
i
read
them
in
and
gauntlets
sitting
on
a
log
by
an
unknown
river
in
the
amazonian
forest
on
the
we
again
embarked
and
made
a
kilometre
and
a
half
spending
most
of
the
time
in
getting
past
two
more
rapids
near
the
first
of
these
we
saw
a
small
cayman
a
at
each
set
of
rapids
the
canoes
were
unloaded
and
the
loads
borne
past
on
the
shoulders
of
the
camaradas
three
of
the
canoes
were
paddled
down
by
a
couple
of
naked
paddlers
apiece
and
the
two
sets
of
double
canoes
were
let
down
by
ropes
one
of
one
couple
being
swamped
but
rescued
and
brought
safely
to
shore
on
each
occasion
one
of
the
men
was
upset
while
working
in
the
swift
water
and
his
face
was
cut
against
the
stones
lyra
and
kermit
did
the
actual
work
with
the
camaradas
kermit
dressed
substantially
like
the
camaradas
themselves
worked
in
the
water
and
as
the
overhanging
branches
were
thronged
with
crowds
of
biting
and
stinging
ants
he
was
marked
and
blistered
over
his
whole
body
indeed
we
all
suffered
more
or
less
from
these
ants
while
the
swarms
of
biting
flies
grew
constantly
more
numerous
the
termites
ate
holes
in
my
helmet
and
also
in
the
cover
of
my
cot
every
one
else
had
a
hammock
at
this
camp
we
had
come
down
the
river
about
kilometres
according
to
the
surveying
records
and
in
height
had
descended
nearly
metres
as
shown
by
the
aneroid
although
the
figure
in
this
case
is
only
an
approximation
as
an
aneroid
can
not
be
depended
on
for
absolute
accuracy
of
results
next
morning
we
found
that
during
the
night
we
had
met
with
a
serious
misfortune
we
had
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
the
canoes
were
moored
to
trees
on
the
bank
at
the
tail
of
the
broken
water
the
two
old
canoes
although
one
of
them
was
our
biggest
were
and
heavy
and
one
of
them
was
leaking
in
the
night
the
river
rose
the
leaky
canoe
which
at
best
was
too
low
in
the
water
must
have
gradually
filled
from
the
wash
of
the
waves
it
sank
dragging
down
the
other
they
began
to
roll
bursting
their
moorings
and
in
the
morning
they
had
disappeared
a
canoe
was
launched
to
look
for
them
but
rolling
over
the
boulders
on
the
rocky
bottom
they
had
at
once
been
riven
asunder
and
the
big
fragments
that
were
soon
found
floating
in
eddies
or
along
the
shore
showed
that
it
was
useless
to
look
farther
we
called
these
rapids
broken
canoe
rapids
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
to
stop
for
some
days
thanks
to
the
rapids
we
had
made
slow
progress
and
with
our
necessarily
limited
supply
of
food
and
no
knowledge
whatever
of
what
was
ahead
of
us
it
was
important
to
make
good
time
but
there
was
no
alternative
we
had
to
build
either
one
big
canoe
or
two
small
ones
it
was
raining
heavily
as
the
men
started
to
explore
in
different
directions
for
good
canoe
trees
three
which
ultimately
proved
not
very
good
for
the
purpose
were
found
close
to
camp
trees
one
of
them
five
feet
in
diameter
three
feet
from
the
ground
the
axemen
immediately
attacked
this
one
under
the
superintendence
of
colonel
rondon
lyra
and
kermit
started
in
opposite
directions
to
hunt
lyra
killed
a
jacu
for
us
and
kermit
killed
two
monkeys
for
the
men
toward
night
fall
it
cleared
the
moon
was
nearly
full
and
the
foaming
river
gleamed
like
silver
our
men
were
regional
volunteers
that
is
they
had
enlisted
in
the
service
of
the
telegraphic
commission
especially
to
do
this
wilderness
work
and
were
highly
paid
as
was
fitting
in
view
of
the
toil
hardship
and
hazard
to
life
and
health
two
of
them
had
been
with
colonel
rondon
during
his
eight
months
exploration
in
at
which
time
his
men
were
regulars
from
his
own
battalion
of
engineers
his
four
aides
during
the
closing
months
of
this
trip
were
lieutenants
lyra
amarante
alencarliense
and
pyrineus
the
naturalist
miranda
ribeiro
also
accompanied
him
this
was
the
year
when
marching
on
foot
through
an
absolutely
unknown
wilderness
the
colonel
and
his
party
finally
reached
the
which
on
the
maps
was
then
and
on
most
maps
is
now
placed
in
an
utterly
wrong
course
and
over
a
degree
out
of
its
real
position
when
they
reached
the
affluents
of
the
a
third
of
the
members
of
the
party
were
so
weak
with
fever
that
they
could
hardly
crawl
they
had
no
baggage
their
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
some
of
the
men
were
almost
naked
for
months
they
had
had
no
food
except
what
little
game
they
shot
and
especially
the
wild
fruits
and
nuts
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
great
abundance
of
the
they
would
all
have
died
at
the
first
big
stream
they
encountered
they
built
a
canoe
and
alencarliense
took
command
of
it
and
descended
to
map
the
course
of
the
river
with
him
went
ribeiro
the
doctor
tanageira
who
could
no
longer
walk
on
account
of
the
ulceration
of
one
foot
three
men
whom
the
fever
had
rendered
unable
longer
to
walk
and
six
men
who
were
as
yet
well
enough
to
handle
the
canoe
by
the
time
the
remainder
of
the
party
came
to
the
next
navigable
river
eleven
more
men
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
their
tether
here
they
ran
across
a
poor
devil
who
had
for
four
months
been
lost
in
the
forest
and
was
dying
of
slow
starvation
he
had
eaten
nothing
but
and
the
grubs
of
insects
he
could
no
longer
walk
but
could
sit
erect
and
totter
feebly
for
a
few
feet
another
canoe
was
built
and
in
it
pyrineus
started
with
the
eleven
fever
patients
and
the
starving
wanderer
colonel
rondon
kept
up
the
morale
of
his
men
by
still
carrying
out
the
forms
of
military
discipline
the
ragged
bugler
had
his
bugle
lieutenant
pyrineus
had
lost
every
particle
of
his
clothing
except
a
hat
and
a
pair
of
drawers
the
lieutenant
drew
up
his
eleven
fever
patients
in
line
the
bugle
sounded
every
one
came
to
attention
and
the
haggard
colonel
read
out
the
orders
of
the
day
then
the
dugout
with
its
load
of
sick
men
started
and
rondon
lyra
amarante
and
the
twelve
remaining
men
resumed
their
weary
march
when
a
fortnight
later
they
finally
struck
a
camp
of
three
of
the
men
were
literally
and
entirely
naked
meanwhile
amilcar
had
ascended
the
jacyparana
a
month
or
two
previously
with
provisions
to
meet
them
for
at
that
time
the
maps
incorrectly
treated
this
river
as
larger
instead
of
smaller
than
the
which
they
were
in
fact
descending
and
colonel
rondon
had
supposed
that
they
were
going
down
the
former
stream
amilcar
returned
after
himself
suffering
much
hardship
and
danger
the
different
parties
finally
met
at
the
mouth
of
the
where
it
enters
the
madeira
the
lost
man
whom
they
had
found
seemed
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
they
left
him
at
a
ranch
on
the
madeira
where
he
could
be
cared
for
yet
after
they
had
left
him
they
heard
that
he
had
died
on
the
the
men
were
still
hard
at
work
hollowing
out
the
hard
wood
of
the
big
tree
with
axe
and
adze
while
watch
and
ward
were
kept
over
them
to
see
that
the
idlers
did
not
shirk
at
the
expense
of
the
industrious
kermit
and
lyra
again
hunted
the
former
shot
a
curassow
which
was
welcome
as
we
were
endeavoring
in
all
ways
to
economize
our
food
supply
we
were
using
the
tops
of
palms
also
i
spent
the
day
hunting
in
the
woods
for
the
most
part
by
the
river
but
saw
nothing
in
the
season
of
the
rains
game
is
away
from
the
river
and
fish
are
scarce
and
turtles
absent
yet
it
was
pleasant
to
be
in
the
great
silent
forest
here
and
there
grew
immense
trees
and
on
some
of
them
mighty
buttresses
sprang
from
the
base
the
lianas
and
vines
were
of
every
size
and
shape
some
were
twisted
and
some
were
not
some
came
down
straight
and
slender
from
branches
a
hundred
feet
above
others
curved
like
long
serpents
around
the
trunks
others
were
like
knotted
cables
in
the
shadow
there
was
little
noise
the
wind
rarely
moved
the
hot
humid
air
there
were
few
flowers
or
birds
insects
were
altogether
too
abundant
and
even
when
travelling
slowly
it
was
impossible
always
to
avoid
them
not
to
speak
of
our
constant
companions
the
bees
mosquitoes
and
especially
the
boroshudas
or
bloodsucking
flies
now
while
bursting
through
a
tangle
i
disturbed
a
nest
of
wasps
whose
resentment
was
active
now
i
heedlessly
stepped
among
the
outliers
of
a
small
party
of
the
carnivorous
foraging
ants
now
grasping
a
branch
as
i
stumbled
i
shook
down
a
shower
of
ants
and
among
all
these
my
attention
was
particularly
arrested
by
the
bite
of
one
of
the
giant
ants
which
stung
like
a
hornet
so
that
i
felt
it
for
three
hours
the
camarades
generally
went
barefoot
or
only
wore
sandals
and
their
ankles
and
feet
were
swollen
and
inflamed
from
the
bites
of
the
boroshudas
and
ants
some
being
actually
incapacitated
from
work
all
of
us
suffered
more
or
less
our
faces
and
hands
swelling
slightly
from
the
boroshuda
bites
and
in
spite
of
our
clothes
we
were
bitten
all
over
our
bodies
chiefly
by
ants
and
the
small
forest
ticks
because
of
the
rain
and
the
heat
our
clothes
were
usually
wet
when
we
took
them
off
at
night
and
just
as
wet
when
we
put
them
on
again
in
the
morning
all
day
on
the
the
men
worked
at
the
canoe
making
good
progress
in
rolling
and
shifting
the
huge
heavy
every
one
had
to
assist
now
and
then
the
work
continued
until
ten
in
the
evening
as
the
weather
was
clear
after
nightfall
some
of
the
men
held
candles
and
the
others
plied
axe
or
adze
standing
within
or
beside
the
great
logs
while
the
flicker
of
the
lights
showed
the
tropic
forest
rising
in
the
darkness
round
about
the
night
air
was
hot
and
still
and
heavy
with
moisture
the
men
were
stripped
to
the
waist
olive
and
copper
and
ebony
their
skins
glistened
as
if
oiled
and
rippled
with
the
ceaseless
play
of
the
thews
beneath
on
the
morning
of
the
the
work
was
resumed
in
a
torrential
tropic
downpour
the
canoe
was
finished
dragged
down
to
the
water
and
launched
soon
after
midday
and
another
hour
or
so
saw
us
under
way
the
descent
was
marked
and
the
swollen
river
raced
along
several
times
we
passed
great
whirlpools
sometimes
shifting
sometimes
steady
half
a
dozen
times
we
ran
over
rapids
and
although
they
were
not
high
enough
to
have
been
obstacles
to
loaded
canadian
canoes
two
of
them
were
serious
to
us
our
heavily
laden
clumsy
dugouts
were
sunk
to
within
three
or
four
inches
of
the
surface
of
the
river
and
although
they
were
buoyed
on
each
side
with
bundles
of
they
shipped
a
great
deal
of
water
in
the
rapids
the
two
biggest
rapids
we
only
just
made
and
after
each
we
had
hastily
to
push
ashore
in
order
to
bail
in
one
set
of
big
ripples
or
waves
my
canoe
was
nearly
swamped
in
a
wilderness
where
what
is
ahead
is
absolutely
unknown
alike
in
terms
of
time
space
and
method
for
we
had
no
idea
where
we
would
come
out
how
we
would
get
out
or
when
we
would
get
out
it
is
of
vital
consequence
not
to
lose
one
outfit
especially
the
provisions
and
yet
it
is
of
only
less
consequence
to
go
as
rapidly
as
possible
lest
all
the
provisions
be
exhausted
and
the
final
stages
of
the
expedition
be
accomplished
by
men
weakened
from
and
therefore
ripe
for
disaster
on
this
occasion
of
the
two
hazards
we
felt
it
necessary
to
risk
running
the
rapids
for
our
progress
had
been
so
very
slow
that
unless
we
made
up
the
time
it
was
probable
that
we
would
be
short
of
food
before
we
got
where
we
could
expect
to
procure
any
more
except
what
little
the
country
in
the
time
of
the
rains
and
floods
might
yield
we
ran
until
after
five
so
that
the
work
of
pitching
camp
was
finished
in
the
dark
we
had
made
nearly
sixteen
kilometres
in
a
direction
slightly
east
of
north
this
evening
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
the
following
morning
the
of
march
we
started
in
good
season
for
six
kilometres
we
drifted
and
paddled
down
the
swift
river
without
incident
at
times
we
saw
lofty
trees
rising
above
the
rest
of
the
forest
on
the
banks
and
back
from
the
river
these
trees
grow
to
enormous
proportions
towering
like
giants
there
were
great
also
their
leaves
always
in
sets
of
threes
then
the
ground
on
either
hand
rose
into
hills
and
the
roar
of
broken
water
announced
that
once
more
our
course
was
checked
by
dangerous
rapids
round
a
bend
we
came
on
them
a
wide
descent
of
white
water
with
an
island
in
the
middle
at
the
upper
edge
here
grave
misfortune
befell
us
and
graver
misfortune
was
narrowly
escaped
kermit
as
usual
was
leading
in
his
canoe
it
was
the
smallest
and
least
seaworthy
of
all
he
had
in
it
little
except
a
week
supply
of
our
boxed
provisions
and
a
few
tools
fortunately
none
of
the
food
for
the
camaradas
his
dog
trigueiro
was
with
him
besides
himself
the
crew
consisted
of
two
men
joao
the
helmsman
or
pilot
as
he
is
called
in
brazil
and
simplicio
the
bowsman
both
were
negroes
and
exceptionally
good
men
in
every
way
kermit
halted
his
canoe
on
the
left
bank
above
the
rapids
and
waited
for
the
colonel
canoe
then
the
colonel
and
lyra
walked
down
the
bank
to
see
what
was
ahead
kermit
took
his
canoe
across
to
the
island
to
see
whether
the
descent
could
be
better
accomplished
on
the
other
side
having
made
his
investigation
he
ordered
the
men
to
return
to
the
bank
he
had
left
and
the
dugout
was
headed
accordingly
before
they
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
the
paddlers
digging
their
paddles
with
all
their
strength
into
the
swift
current
one
of
the
shifting
whirlpools
of
which
i
have
spoken
came
whirled
them
around
and
swept
them
so
close
to
the
rapids
that
no
human
power
could
avoid
going
over
them
as
they
were
drifting
into
them
broadside
on
kermit
yelled
to
the
steersman
to
turn
her
head
so
as
to
take
them
in
the
only
way
that
offered
any
chance
whatever
of
safety
the
water
came
aboard
wave
after
wave
as
they
raced
down
they
reached
the
bottom
with
the
canoe
upright
but
so
full
as
barely
to
float
and
the
paddlers
urged
her
toward
the
shore
they
had
nearly
reached
the
bank
when
another
whirlpool
or
whirling
eddy
tore
them
away
and
hurried
them
back
to
midstream
where
the
dugout
filled
and
turned
over
joao
seizing
the
rope
started
to
swim
ashore
the
rope
was
pulled
from
his
hand
but
he
reached
the
bank
poor
simplicio
must
have
been
pulled
under
at
once
and
his
life
beaten
out
on
the
boulders
beneath
the
racing
torrent
he
never
rose
again
nor
did
we
ever
recover
his
body
kermit
clutched
his
rifle
his
favorite
winchester
with
which
he
had
done
most
of
his
hunting
both
in
africa
and
america
and
climbed
on
the
bottom
of
the
upset
boat
in
a
minute
he
was
swept
into
the
second
series
of
rapids
and
whirled
away
from
the
rolling
boat
losing
his
rifle
the
water
beat
his
helmet
down
over
his
head
and
face
and
drove
him
beneath
the
surface
and
when
he
rose
at
last
he
was
almost
drowned
his
breath
and
strength
almost
spent
he
was
in
swift
but
quiet
water
and
swam
toward
an
overhanging
branch
his
jacket
hindered
him
but
he
knew
he
was
too
nearly
gone
to
be
able
to
get
it
off
and
thinking
with
the
curious
calm
one
feels
when
death
is
but
a
moment
away
he
realized
that
the
utmost
his
failing
strength
could
do
was
to
reach
the
branch
he
reached
and
clutched
it
and
then
almost
lacked
strength
to
haul
himself
out
on
the
land
good
trigueiro
had
faithfully
swum
alongside
him
through
the
rapids
and
now
himself
scrambled
ashore
it
was
a
very
narrow
escape
kermit
was
a
great
comfort
and
help
to
me
on
the
trip
but
the
fear
of
some
fatal
accident
befalling
him
was
always
a
nightmare
to
me
he
was
to
be
married
as
soon
as
the
trip
was
over
and
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
i
could
bear
to
bring
bad
tidings
to
his
betrothed
and
to
his
mother
simplicio
was
unmarried
later
we
sent
to
his
mother
all
the
money
that
would
have
been
his
had
he
lived
the
following
morning
we
put
on
one
side
of
the
post
erected
to
mark
our
the
following
inscription
in
portuguese
in
these
rapids
died
poor
simplicio
on
an
expedition
such
as
ours
death
is
one
of
the
accidents
that
may
at
any
time
occur
and
narrow
escapes
from
death
are
too
common
to
be
felt
as
they
would
be
felt
elsewhere
one
mourns
sincerely
but
mourning
can
not
interfere
with
labor
we
immediately
proceeded
with
the
work
of
the
portage
from
the
head
to
the
tail
of
this
series
of
rapids
the
distance
was
about
six
hundred
yards
a
path
was
cut
along
the
bank
over
which
the
loads
were
brought
the
empty
canoes
ran
the
rapids
without
mishap
each
with
two
skilled
paddlers
one
of
the
canoes
almost
ran
into
a
swimming
tapir
at
the
head
of
the
rapids
it
went
down
the
rapids
and
then
climbed
out
of
the
river
kermit
accompanied
by
joao
went
three
or
four
miles
down
the
river
looking
for
the
body
of
simplicio
and
for
the
sunk
canoe
he
found
neither
but
he
found
a
box
of
provisions
and
a
paddle
and
salvaged
both
by
swimming
into
midstream
after
them
he
also
found
that
a
couple
of
kilometres
below
there
was
another
stretch
of
rapids
and
following
them
on
the
bank
to
the
foot
he
found
that
they
were
worse
than
the
ones
we
had
just
passed
and
impassable
for
canoes
on
this
side
we
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
we
had
just
passed
there
were
many
small
birds
here
but
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
see
or
shoot
them
in
the
lofty
tree
tops
and
to
find
them
in
the
tangle
beneath
if
they
were
shot
however
cherrie
got
four
species
new
to
the
collection
one
was
a
tiny
hummer
one
of
the
species
known
as
woodstars
with
dainty
but
not
brilliant
plumage
its
kind
is
never
found
except
in
the
deep
dark
woods
not
coming
out
into
the
sunshine
its
crop
was
filled
with
ants
when
shot
it
was
feeding
at
a
cluster
of
long
red
flowers
he
also
got
a
very
handsome
trogon
and
an
exquisite
little
tanager
as
brilliant
as
a
cluster
of
jewels
its
throat
was
lilac
its
breast
turquoise
its
crown
and
forehead
topaz
while
above
it
was
glossy
the
lower
part
of
the
back
this
tanager
was
a
female
i
can
hardly
imagine
that
the
male
is
more
brilliantly
colored
the
fourth
bird
was
a
queer
hawk
of
the
genus
ibycter
black
with
a
white
belly
naked
red
cheeks
and
throat
and
red
legs
and
feet
its
crop
was
filled
with
the
seeds
of
fruits
and
a
few
insect
remains
an
extraordinary
diet
for
a
hawk
the
morning
of
the
was
dark
and
gloomy
through
sheets
of
blinding
rain
we
left
our
camp
of
misfortune
for
another
camp
where
misfortune
also
awaited
us
less
than
half
an
hour
took
our
dugouts
to
the
head
of
the
rapids
below
as
kermit
had
already
explored
the
hand
side
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
went
down
the
side
and
found
a
channel
which
led
round
the
worst
part
so
that
they
deemed
it
possible
to
let
down
the
canoes
by
ropes
from
the
bank
the
distance
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
was
about
a
kilometre
while
the
loads
were
being
brought
down
the
left
bank
luiz
and
antonio
correa
our
two
best
watermen
started
to
take
a
canoe
down
the
right
side
and
colonel
rondon
walked
ahead
to
see
anything
he
could
about
the
river
he
was
accompanied
by
one
of
our
three
dogs
lobo
after
walking
about
a
kilometre
he
heard
ahead
a
kind
of
howling
noise
which
he
thought
was
made
by
he
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
lobo
ran
ahead
in
a
minute
he
heard
lobo
yell
with
pain
and
then
still
yelping
come
toward
him
while
the
creature
that
was
howling
also
approached
evidently
in
pursuit
in
a
moment
a
second
yell
from
lobo
followed
by
silence
announced
that
he
was
dead
and
the
sound
of
the
howling
when
near
convinced
rondon
that
the
dog
had
been
killed
by
an
indian
doubtless
with
two
arrows
probably
the
indian
was
howling
to
lure
the
toward
him
rondon
fired
his
rifle
in
the
air
to
warn
off
the
indian
or
indians
who
in
all
probability
had
never
seen
a
civilized
man
and
certainly
could
not
imagine
that
one
was
in
the
neighborhood
he
then
returned
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
where
the
portage
was
still
going
on
and
in
company
with
lyra
kermit
and
antonio
parecis
the
indian
walked
back
to
where
lobo
body
lay
sure
enough
he
found
him
slain
by
two
arrows
one
was
in
him
and
near
by
was
a
strange
stick
used
in
the
very
primitive
method
of
fishing
of
all
these
indians
antonio
recognized
its
purpose
the
indians
who
were
apparently
two
or
three
in
number
had
fled
some
beads
and
trinkets
were
left
on
the
spot
to
show
that
we
were
not
angry
and
were
friendly
meanwhile
cherrie
stayed
at
the
head
and
i
at
the
foot
of
the
portage
as
guards
luiz
and
antonio
correa
brought
down
one
canoe
safely
the
next
was
the
new
canoe
which
was
very
large
and
heavy
being
made
of
wood
that
would
not
float
in
the
rapids
the
rope
broke
and
the
canoe
was
lost
luiz
being
nearly
drowned
it
was
a
very
bad
thing
to
lose
the
canoe
but
it
was
even
worse
to
lose
the
rope
and
pulleys
this
meant
that
it
would
be
physically
impossible
to
hoist
big
canoes
up
even
small
hills
or
rocky
hillocks
such
as
had
been
so
frequent
beside
the
many
rapids
we
had
encountered
it
was
not
wise
to
spend
the
four
days
necessary
to
build
new
canoes
where
we
were
in
danger
of
attack
from
the
indians
moreover
new
rapids
might
be
very
near
in
which
case
the
new
canoes
would
hamper
us
yet
the
four
remaining
canoes
would
not
carry
all
the
loads
and
all
the
men
no
matter
how
we
cut
the
loads
down
and
we
intended
to
cut
everything
down
at
once
we
had
been
gone
eighteen
days
we
had
used
over
a
third
of
our
food
we
had
gone
only
kilometres
and
it
was
probable
that
we
had
at
least
five
times
perhaps
six
or
seven
times
this
distance
still
to
go
we
had
taken
a
fortnight
to
descend
rapids
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
less
than
seventy
yards
of
fall
a
very
few
yards
of
fall
makes
a
dangerous
rapid
when
the
river
is
swollen
and
swift
and
there
are
obstructions
we
had
only
one
aneroid
to
determine
our
altitude
and
therefore
could
make
merely
a
loose
approximation
to
it
but
we
probably
had
between
two
and
three
times
this
descent
in
the
aggregate
of
rapids
ahead
of
us
so
far
the
country
had
offered
little
in
the
way
of
food
except
we
had
lost
four
canoes
and
one
man
we
were
in
the
country
of
wild
indians
who
shot
well
with
their
bows
it
behooved
us
to
go
warily
but
also
to
make
all
speed
possible
if
we
were
to
avoid
serious
trouble
the
best
plan
seemed
to
be
to
march
thirteen
men
down
along
the
bank
while
the
remaining
canoes
lashed
two
and
two
floated
down
beside
them
if
after
two
or
three
days
we
found
no
bad
rapids
and
there
seemed
a
reasonable
chance
of
going
some
distance
at
decent
speed
we
could
then
build
the
new
canoes
preferably
two
small
ones
this
time
instead
of
one
big
one
we
left
all
the
baggage
we
could
we
were
already
down
as
far
as
comfort
would
permit
but
we
now
struck
off
much
of
the
comfort
cherrie
kermit
and
i
had
been
sleeping
under
a
very
light
fly
and
there
was
another
small
light
tent
for
one
person
kept
for
possible
emergencies
the
last
was
given
to
me
for
my
cot
and
all
five
of
the
others
swung
their
hammocks
under
the
big
fly
this
meant
that
we
left
two
big
and
heavy
tents
behind
a
box
of
surveying
instruments
was
also
abandoned
each
of
us
got
his
personal
belongings
down
to
one
box
or
although
there
was
only
a
small
diminution
thus
made
because
we
had
so
little
that
the
only
way
to
make
a
serious
diminution
was
to
restrict
ourselves
to
the
clothes
on
our
backs
the
biting
flies
and
ants
were
to
us
a
source
of
discomfort
and
at
times
of
what
could
fairly
be
called
torment
but
to
the
camaradas
most
of
whom
went
barefoot
or
only
wore
sandals
and
they
never
did
or
would
wear
shoes
the
effect
was
more
serious
they
wrapped
their
legs
and
feet
in
pieces
of
canvas
or
hide
and
the
feet
of
three
of
them
became
so
swollen
that
they
were
crippled
and
could
not
walk
any
distance
the
doctor
whose
courage
and
cheerfulness
never
flagged
took
excellent
care
of
them
thanks
to
him
there
had
been
among
them
hitherto
but
one
or
two
slight
cases
of
fever
he
administered
to
each
man
daily
a
nearly
eight
grains
of
quinine
and
every
third
or
fourth
day
a
double
dose
the
following
morning
colonel
rondon
lyra
kermit
cherrie
and
nine
of
the
camaradas
started
in
single
file
down
the
bank
while
the
doctor
and
i
went
in
the
two
double
canoes
with
six
camaradas
three
of
them
the
invalids
with
swollen
feet
we
halted
continually
as
we
went
about
three
times
as
fast
as
the
walkers
and
we
traced
the
course
of
the
river
after
forty
minutes
actual
going
in
the
boats
we
came
to
some
rapids
the
unloaded
canoes
ran
them
without
difficulty
while
the
loads
were
portaged
in
an
hour
and
a
half
we
were
again
under
way
but
in
ten
minutes
came
to
other
rapids
where
the
river
ran
among
islands
and
there
were
several
big
curls
the
clumsy
heavily
laden
dugouts
lashed
in
couples
were
unwieldy
and
hard
to
handle
the
rapids
came
just
round
a
sharp
bend
and
we
got
caught
in
the
upper
part
of
the
swift
water
and
had
to
run
the
first
set
of
rapids
in
consequence
we
in
the
leading
pair
of
dugouts
were
within
an
ace
of
coming
to
grief
on
some
big
boulders
against
which
we
were
swept
by
a
cross
current
at
the
turn
all
of
us
paddling
hard
scraping
and
bumping
we
got
through
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
and
managed
to
make
the
bank
and
moor
our
dugouts
it
was
a
narrow
escape
from
grave
disaster
the
second
pair
of
lashed
dugouts
profited
by
our
experience
and
made
the
run
with
risk
but
with
less
risk
and
moored
beside
us
then
all
the
loads
were
taken
out
and
the
empty
canoes
were
run
down
through
the
least
dangerous
channels
among
the
islands
this
was
a
long
portage
and
we
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
having
made
nearly
seven
kilometres
here
a
little
river
a
rapid
stream
of
volume
equal
to
the
duvida
at
the
point
where
we
first
embarked
joined
from
the
west
colonel
rondon
and
kermit
came
to
it
first
and
the
former
named
it
rio
kermit
there
was
in
it
a
waterfall
about
six
or
eight
feet
high
just
above
the
junction
here
we
found
plenty
of
fish
lyra
caught
two
pacu
fish
they
were
delicious
eating
antonio
the
parecis
said
that
these
fish
never
came
up
heavy
rapids
in
which
there
were
falls
they
had
to
jump
we
could
only
hope
that
he
was
correct
as
in
that
case
the
rapids
we
would
encounter
in
the
future
would
rarely
be
so
serious
as
to
necessitate
our
dragging
the
heavy
dugouts
overland
passing
the
rapids
we
had
hitherto
encountered
had
meant
severe
labor
and
some
danger
but
the
event
showed
that
he
was
mistaken
the
worst
rapids
were
ahead
of
us
while
our
course
as
a
whole
had
been
almost
due
north
and
sometimes
east
of
north
yet
where
there
were
rapids
the
river
had
generally
although
not
always
turned
westward
this
seemed
to
indicate
that
to
the
east
of
us
there
was
a
low
northward
projection
of
the
central
plateau
across
which
we
had
travelled
on
this
is
the
kind
of
projection
that
appears
on
the
maps
of
this
region
as
a
sierra
probably
it
sent
low
spurs
to
the
west
and
the
farthest
points
of
these
spurs
now
and
then
caused
rapids
in
our
course
for
the
rapids
generally
came
where
there
were
hills
and
for
the
moment
deflected
the
river
westward
from
its
general
downhill
trend
to
the
north
there
was
no
longer
any
question
that
the
duvida
was
a
big
river
a
river
of
real
importance
it
was
not
a
minor
affluent
of
some
other
affluent
but
we
were
still
wholly
in
the
dark
as
to
where
it
came
out
it
was
still
possible
although
exceedingly
improbable
that
it
entered
the
as
another
river
of
substantially
the
same
size
near
its
mouth
it
was
much
more
likely
but
not
probable
that
it
entered
the
tapajos
it
was
probable
although
far
from
certain
that
it
entered
the
madeira
low
down
near
its
point
of
junction
with
the
amazon
in
this
event
it
was
likely
although
again
far
from
certain
that
its
mouth
would
prove
to
be
the
aripuanan
the
aripuanan
does
not
appear
on
the
maps
as
a
river
of
any
size
on
a
good
standard
map
of
south
america
which
i
had
with
me
its
name
does
not
appear
at
all
although
a
dotted
indication
of
a
small
river
or
creek
at
about
the
right
place
probably
represents
it
nevertheless
from
the
report
of
one
of
his
lieutenants
who
had
examined
its
mouth
and
from
the
stories
of
the
or
seringueiros
colonel
rondon
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
the
largest
affluent
of
the
madeira
with
such
a
body
of
water
that
it
must
have
a
big
drainage
basin
he
thought
that
the
duvida
was
probably
one
of
its
head
streams
although
every
existing
map
represented
the
lay
of
the
land
to
be
such
as
to
render
impossible
the
existence
of
such
a
river
system
and
drainage
basin
the
reported
that
they
had
gone
many
journey
up
the
river
to
a
point
where
there
was
a
series
of
heavy
rapids
with
above
them
the
junction
point
of
two
large
rivers
one
entering
from
the
west
beyond
this
they
had
difficulties
because
of
the
hostility
of
the
indians
and
where
the
junction
point
was
no
one
could
say
on
the
chance
colonel
rondon
had
directed
one
of
his
subordinate
officers
lieutenant
pyrineus
to
try
to
meet
us
with
boats
and
provisions
by
ascending
the
aripuanan
to
the
point
of
entry
of
its
first
big
affluent
this
was
the
course
followed
when
amilcar
had
been
directed
to
try
to
meet
the
explorers
who
in
came
down
the
at
that
time
the
effort
was
a
failure
and
the
two
parties
never
met
but
we
might
have
better
luck
and
in
any
event
the
chance
was
worth
taking
on
the
morning
following
our
camping
by
the
mouth
of
the
rio
kermit
colonel
rondon
took
a
good
deal
of
pains
in
getting
a
big
post
set
up
at
the
entry
of
the
smaller
river
into
the
duvida
then
he
summoned
me
and
all
the
others
to
attend
the
ceremony
of
its
erection
we
found
the
camaradas
drawn
up
in
line
and
the
colonel
preparing
to
read
aloud
the
orders
of
the
day
to
the
post
was
nailed
a
board
with
rio
kermit
on
it
and
the
colonel
read
the
orders
reciting
that
by
the
direction
of
the
brazilian
government
and
inasmuch
as
the
unknown
river
was
evidently
a
great
river
he
formally
christened
it
the
rio
roosevelt
this
was
a
complete
surprise
to
me
both
lauro
miller
and
colonel
rondon
had
spoken
to
me
on
the
subject
and
i
had
urged
and
kermit
had
urged
as
strongly
as
possible
that
the
name
be
kept
as
rio
da
duvida
we
felt
that
the
river
of
doubt
was
an
unusually
good
name
and
it
is
always
well
to
keep
a
name
of
this
character
but
my
kind
friends
insisted
otherwise
and
it
would
have
been
churlish
of
me
to
object
longer
i
was
much
touched
by
their
action
and
by
the
ceremony
itself
at
the
conclusion
of
the
reading
colonel
rondon
led
in
cheers
for
the
united
states
and
then
for
me
and
for
kermit
and
the
camaradas
cheered
with
a
will
i
proposed
three
cheers
for
brazil
and
then
for
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
and
the
doctor
and
then
for
all
the
camaradas
then
lyra
said
that
everybody
had
been
cheered
except
cherrie
and
so
we
all
gave
three
cheers
for
cherrie
and
the
meeting
broke
up
in
high
good
humor
immediately
afterward
the
walkers
set
off
on
their
march
downstream
looking
for
good
canoe
trees
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
followed
with
the
canoes
as
often
as
we
overtook
them
we
halted
until
they
had
again
gone
a
good
distance
ahead
they
soon
found
fresh
indian
sign
and
actually
heard
the
indians
but
the
latter
fled
in
panic
they
came
on
a
little
indian
fishing
village
just
abandoned
the
three
low
oblong
huts
of
palm
leaves
had
each
an
entrance
for
a
man
on
all
fours
but
no
other
opening
they
were
dark
inside
doubtless
as
a
protection
against
the
swarms
of
biting
flies
on
a
pole
in
this
village
an
axe
a
knife
and
some
strings
of
red
beads
were
left
with
the
hope
that
the
indians
would
return
find
the
gifts
and
realize
that
we
were
friendly
we
saw
further
indian
sign
on
both
sides
of
the
river
after
about
two
hours
and
a
half
we
came
on
a
little
river
entering
from
the
east
it
was
broad
but
shallow
and
at
the
point
of
entrance
rushed
down
green
and
white
over
a
sharply
inclined
sheet
of
rock
it
was
a
lovely
sight
and
we
halted
to
admire
it
then
on
we
went
until
when
we
had
covered
about
eight
kilometres
we
came
on
a
stretch
of
rapids
the
canoes
ran
them
with
about
a
third
of
the
loads
the
other
loads
being
carried
on
the
men
shoulders
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
we
camped
as
there
were
several
good
canoe
trees
near
and
we
had
decided
to
build
two
rather
small
canoes
after
dark
the
stars
came
out
but
in
the
deep
forest
the
glory
of
the
stars
in
the
night
of
the
sky
the
serene
radiance
of
the
moon
the
splendor
of
sunrise
and
sunset
are
never
seen
as
they
are
seen
on
the
vast
open
plains
the
following
day
the
the
men
began
work
on
the
canoes
the
big
canoe
had
been
made
of
wood
so
hard
that
it
was
difficult
to
work
and
so
heavy
that
the
chips
sank
like
lead
in
the
water
but
these
trees
were
araputangas
with
wood
which
was
easier
to
work
and
which
floated
great
buttresses
or
flanges
jutted
out
from
their
trunks
at
the
base
and
they
bore
big
hard
nuts
or
fruits
which
stood
erect
at
the
ends
of
the
branches
the
first
tree
felled
proved
rotten
and
moreover
it
was
chopped
so
that
it
smashed
a
number
of
lesser
trees
into
the
kitchen
overthrowing
everything
but
not
inflicting
serious
damage
hardworking
willing
and
tough
though
the
camaradas
were
they
naturally
did
not
have
the
skill
of
northern
lumberjacks
we
hoped
to
finish
the
two
canoes
in
three
days
a
space
was
cleared
in
the
forest
for
our
tents
among
the
taller
trees
grew
pacovas
or
wild
bananas
we
bathed
and
swam
in
the
river
although
in
it
we
caught
piranhas
carregadores
ants
swarmed
all
around
our
camp
as
many
of
the
nearest
of
their
holes
as
we
could
we
stopped
with
fire
but
at
night
some
of
them
got
into
our
tents
and
ate
things
we
could
ill
spare
in
the
early
morning
a
column
of
foraging
ants
appeared
and
we
drove
them
back
also
with
fire
when
the
sky
was
not
overcast
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
we
spread
out
everything
to
dry
there
were
many
wonderful
butterflies
round
about
but
only
a
few
birds
yet
in
the
early
morning
and
late
afternoon
there
was
some
attractive
bird
music
in
the
woods
the
two
best
performers
were
our
old
friend
the
false
bellbird
with
its
series
of
ringing
whistles
and
a
shy
attractive
the
latter
walked
much
on
the
ground
with
dainty
movements
curtseying
and
raising
its
tail
and
in
accent
and
sequence
although
not
in
tone
or
time
its
song
resembled
that
of
our
sparrow
it
was
three
weeks
since
we
had
started
down
the
river
of
doubt
we
had
come
along
its
winding
course
about
kilometres
with
a
descent
of
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
metres
it
had
been
slow
progress
we
could
not
tell
what
physical
obstacles
were
ahead
of
us
nor
whether
the
indians
would
be
actively
hostile
but
a
river
normally
describes
in
its
course
a
parabola
the
steep
descent
being
in
the
upper
part
and
we
hoped
that
in
the
future
we
should
not
have
to
encounter
so
many
and
such
difficult
rapids
as
we
had
already
encountered
and
that
therefore
we
would
make
better
time
a
hope
destined
to
failure
ix
down
an
unknown
river
into
the
equatorial
forest
the
mightiest
river
in
the
world
is
the
amazon
it
runs
from
west
to
east
from
the
sunset
to
the
sunrise
from
the
andes
to
the
atlantic
the
main
stream
flows
almost
along
the
equator
while
the
basin
which
contains
its
affluents
extends
many
degrees
north
and
south
of
the
equator
the
gigantic
equatorial
river
basin
is
filled
with
an
immense
forest
the
largest
in
the
world
with
which
no
other
forest
can
be
compared
save
those
of
western
africa
and
malaysia
we
were
within
the
southern
boundary
of
this
great
equatorial
forest
on
a
river
which
was
not
merely
unknown
but
unguessed
at
no
geographer
having
ever
suspected
its
existence
this
river
flowed
northward
toward
the
equator
but
whither
it
would
go
whether
it
would
turn
one
way
or
another
the
length
of
its
course
where
it
would
come
out
the
character
of
the
stream
itself
and
the
character
of
the
dwellers
along
its
banks
all
these
things
were
yet
to
be
discovered
one
morning
while
the
canoes
were
being
built
kermit
and
i
walked
a
few
kilometres
down
the
river
and
surveyed
the
next
rapids
below
the
vast
still
forest
was
almost
empty
of
life
we
found
old
indian
signs
there
were
very
few
birds
and
these
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
we
saw
a
recent
tapir
track
and
under
a
cajazeira
tree
by
the
bank
there
were
the
tracks
of
capybaras
which
had
been
eating
the
fallen
fruit
this
fruit
is
delicious
and
would
make
a
valuable
addition
to
our
orchards
the
tree
although
tropical
is
hardy
thrives
when
domesticated
and
propagates
rapidly
from
shoots
the
department
of
agriculture
should
try
whether
it
would
not
grow
in
southern
california
and
florida
this
was
the
tree
from
which
the
family
name
was
taken
his
parental
grandfather
although
of
portuguese
blood
was
an
intensely
patriotic
brazilian
he
was
a
very
young
man
when
the
independence
of
brazil
was
declared
and
did
not
wish
to
keep
the
portuguese
family
name
so
he
changed
it
to
that
of
the
fine
brazilian
tree
in
question
such
change
of
family
names
is
common
in
brazil
doctor
vital
brazil
the
student
of
poisonous
serpents
was
given
his
name
by
his
father
whose
own
family
name
was
entirely
different
and
his
brother
name
was
again
different
there
were
tremendous
downpours
of
rain
lasting
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
accompanied
by
thunder
and
lightning
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
as
if
the
rains
were
less
heavy
and
continuous
than
they
had
been
we
all
of
us
had
to
help
in
building
the
canoes
now
and
then
kermit
accompanied
by
antonio
the
parecis
and
joao
crossed
the
river
and
walked
back
to
the
little
river
that
had
entered
from
the
east
so
as
to
bring
back
a
report
of
it
to
colonel
rondon
lyra
took
observations
by
the
sun
and
by
the
stars
we
were
in
about
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
due
north
of
where
we
had
started
the
river
had
wound
so
that
we
had
gone
two
miles
for
every
one
we
made
northward
our
progress
had
been
very
slow
and
until
we
got
out
of
the
region
of
incessant
rapids
with
their
attendant
labor
and
hazard
it
was
not
likely
that
we
should
go
much
faster
on
the
morning
of
march
we
started
in
our
six
canoes
we
made
ten
kilometres
twenty
minutes
after
starting
we
came
to
the
first
rapids
here
every
one
walked
except
the
three
best
paddlers
who
took
the
canoes
down
in
succession
an
hour
job
soon
after
this
we
struck
a
bees
nest
in
the
top
of
a
tree
overhanging
the
river
our
steersman
climbed
out
and
robbed
it
but
alas
lost
the
honey
on
the
way
back
we
came
to
a
small
steep
fall
which
we
did
not
dare
run
in
our
laden
clumsy
and
cranky
dugouts
fortunately
we
were
able
to
follow
a
deep
canal
which
led
off
for
a
kilometre
returning
just
below
the
falls
fifty
yards
from
where
it
had
started
then
having
been
in
the
boats
and
in
motion
only
one
hour
and
a
half
we
came
to
a
long
stretch
of
rapids
which
it
took
us
six
hours
to
descend
and
we
camped
at
the
foot
everything
was
taken
out
of
the
canoes
and
they
were
run
down
in
succession
at
one
difficult
and
perilous
place
they
were
let
down
by
ropes
and
even
thus
we
almost
lost
one
we
went
down
the
right
bank
on
the
opposite
bank
was
an
indian
village
evidently
inhabited
only
during
the
dry
season
the
marks
on
the
stumps
of
trees
showed
that
these
indians
had
axes
and
knives
and
there
were
old
fields
in
which
maize
beans
and
cotton
had
been
grown
the
forest
dripped
and
steamed
were
plentiful
at
one
point
the
tops
of
a
group
of
tall
trees
were
covered
with
white
blossoms
others
bore
red
blossoms
many
of
the
big
trees
of
different
kinds
were
buttressed
at
the
base
with
great
thin
walls
of
wood
others
including
both
palms
and
ordinary
trees
showed
an
even
stranger
peculiarity
the
trunk
near
the
base
but
sometimes
six
or
eight
feet
from
the
ground
was
split
into
a
dozen
or
twenty
branches
or
small
trunks
which
sloped
outward
in
shape
each
becoming
a
root
the
larger
trees
of
this
type
looked
as
if
their
trunks
were
seated
on
the
tops
of
the
pole
frames
of
indian
tepees
at
one
point
in
the
stream
to
our
great
surprise
we
saw
a
flying
fish
it
skimmed
the
water
like
a
swallow
for
over
twenty
yards
although
we
made
only
ten
kilometres
we
worked
hard
all
day
the
last
canoes
were
brought
down
and
moored
to
the
bank
at
nightfall
our
tents
were
pitched
in
the
darkness
next
day
we
made
thirteen
kilometres
we
ran
all
told
a
little
over
an
hour
and
seven
hours
were
spent
in
getting
past
a
series
of
rapids
at
which
the
portage
over
rocky
and
difficult
ground
was
a
kilometre
long
the
canoes
were
run
down
empty
a
hazardous
run
in
which
one
of
them
upset
yet
while
we
were
actually
on
the
river
paddling
and
floating
downstream
along
the
reaches
of
swift
smooth
water
it
was
very
lovely
when
we
started
in
the
morning
the
day
was
overcast
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
vapor
ahead
of
us
the
shrouded
river
stretched
between
dim
walls
of
forest
half
seen
in
the
mist
then
the
sun
burned
up
the
fog
and
loomed
through
it
in
a
red
splendor
that
changed
first
to
gold
and
then
to
molten
white
in
the
dazzling
light
under
the
brilliant
blue
of
the
sky
every
detail
of
the
magnificent
forest
was
vivid
to
the
eye
the
great
trees
the
network
of
bush
ropes
the
caverns
of
greenery
where
vines
covered
all
things
else
wherever
there
was
a
hidden
boulder
the
surface
of
the
current
was
broken
by
waves
in
one
place
in
midstream
a
pyramidal
rock
thrust
itself
six
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
river
on
the
banks
we
found
fresh
indian
sign
at
home
in
vermont
cherrie
is
a
farmer
with
a
farm
of
six
hundred
acres
most
of
it
woodland
as
we
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
watching
for
the
last
dugouts
with
their
naked
paddlers
to
swing
into
sight
round
the
bend
through
the
white
water
we
talked
of
the
northern
spring
that
was
just
beginning
he
sells
cream
eggs
poultry
potatoes
honey
occasionally
pork
and
veal
but
at
this
season
it
was
the
time
for
the
maple
sugar
crop
he
has
a
sugar
orchard
where
he
taps
twelve
hundred
trees
and
hopes
soon
to
tap
as
many
more
in
addition
said
cherrie
it
a
busy
time
now
for
fred
rice
fred
rice
is
the
hired
man
and
in
sugar
time
the
cherrie
boys
help
him
with
enthusiasm
and
moreover
are
paid
with
exact
justice
for
the
work
they
do
there
is
much
wild
life
about
the
farm
although
it
is
near
brattleboro
one
night
in
early
spring
a
bear
left
his
tracks
near
the
sugar
house
and
now
and
then
in
summer
cherrie
has
had
to
sleep
in
the
garden
to
keep
the
deer
away
from
the
beans
cabbages
and
beets
there
was
not
much
bird
life
in
the
forest
but
cherrie
kept
getting
species
new
to
the
collection
at
this
camp
he
shot
an
interesting
little
it
was
the
size
of
a
warbler
with
white
of
the
wings
and
tail
white
on
the
and
a
large
spot
of
white
on
the
back
normally
almost
concealed
the
feathers
on
the
back
being
long
and
fluffy
when
he
shot
the
bird
a
male
it
was
showing
off
before
a
little
bird
doubtless
the
female
and
the
chief
feature
of
the
display
was
this
white
spot
on
the
back
the
white
feathers
were
raised
and
displayed
so
that
the
spot
flashed
like
the
chrysanthemum
on
a
prongbuck
whose
curiosity
has
been
aroused
in
the
gloom
of
the
forest
the
bird
was
hard
to
see
but
the
flashing
of
this
patch
of
white
feathers
revealed
it
at
once
attracting
immediate
attention
it
was
an
excellent
example
of
a
coloration
mark
which
served
a
purely
advertising
purpose
apparently
it
was
part
of
a
courtship
display
the
bird
was
about
thirty
feet
up
in
the
branches
in
the
morning
just
before
leaving
this
camp
a
tapir
swam
across
stream
a
little
way
above
us
but
unfortunately
we
could
not
get
a
shot
at
it
an
ample
supply
of
tapir
beef
would
have
meant
much
to
us
we
had
started
with
fifty
days
rations
but
this
by
no
means
meant
full
rations
in
the
sense
of
giving
every
man
all
he
wanted
to
eat
we
had
two
meals
a
day
and
were
on
rather
short
commons
both
our
mess
and
the
camaradas
except
when
we
got
plenty
of
for
our
mess
we
had
the
boxes
chosen
by
fiala
each
containing
a
rations
for
six
men
our
number
but
we
made
each
box
last
a
day
and
a
half
or
at
times
two
days
and
in
addition
we
gave
some
of
the
food
to
the
camaradas
it
was
only
on
the
rare
occasions
when
we
had
killed
some
monkeys
or
curassows
or
caught
some
fish
that
everybody
had
enough
we
would
have
welcomed
that
tapir
so
far
the
game
fish
and
fruit
had
been
too
scarce
to
be
an
element
of
weight
in
our
food
supply
in
an
exploring
trip
like
ours
through
a
difficult
and
utterly
unknown
country
especially
if
densely
forested
there
is
little
time
to
halt
and
game
can
not
be
counted
on
it
is
only
in
lands
like
our
own
west
thirty
years
ago
like
south
africa
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
like
east
africa
that
game
can
be
made
the
chief
food
supply
on
this
trip
our
only
substantial
food
supply
from
the
country
hitherto
had
been
that
furnished
by
the
palmtops
two
men
were
detailed
every
day
to
cut
down
palms
for
food
a
kilometre
and
a
half
after
leaving
this
camp
we
came
on
a
stretch
of
big
rapids
the
river
here
twists
in
loops
and
we
had
heard
the
roaring
of
these
rapids
the
previous
afternoon
then
we
passed
out
of
earshot
of
them
but
antonio
correa
our
best
waterman
insisted
all
along
that
the
roaring
meant
rapids
worse
than
any
we
had
encountered
for
some
days
i
was
brought
up
in
the
water
and
i
know
it
like
a
fish
and
all
its
sounds
said
he
he
was
right
we
had
to
carry
the
loads
nearly
a
kilometre
that
afternoon
and
the
canoes
were
pulled
out
on
the
bank
so
that
they
might
be
in
readiness
to
be
dragged
overland
next
day
rondon
lyra
kermit
and
antonio
correa
explored
both
sides
of
the
river
on
the
opposite
or
left
bank
they
found
the
mouth
of
a
considerable
river
bigger
than
the
rio
kermit
flowing
in
from
the
west
and
making
its
entrance
in
the
middle
of
the
rapids
this
river
we
christened
the
taunay
in
honor
of
a
distinguished
brazilian
an
explorer
a
soldier
a
senator
who
was
also
a
writer
of
note
kermit
had
with
him
two
of
his
novels
and
i
had
read
one
of
his
books
dealing
with
a
disastrous
retreat
during
the
paraguayan
war
next
morning
the
the
canoes
were
brought
down
a
path
was
chopped
for
them
and
rollers
laid
and
down
the
rapids
lyra
and
kermit
who
were
overseeing
the
work
as
well
as
doing
their
share
of
the
pushing
and
hauling
got
them
into
a
canal
of
smooth
water
which
saved
much
severe
labor
as
our
food
supply
lowered
we
were
constantly
more
desirous
of
economizing
the
strength
of
the
men
one
day
more
would
complete
a
month
since
we
had
embarked
on
the
duvida
as
we
had
started
in
february
the
lunar
and
calendar
months
coincided
we
had
used
up
over
half
our
provisions
we
had
come
only
a
trifle
over
kilometres
thanks
to
the
character
and
number
of
the
rapids
we
believed
we
had
three
or
four
times
the
distance
yet
to
go
before
coming
to
a
part
of
the
river
where
we
might
hope
to
meet
assistance
either
from
or
from
pyrineus
if
he
were
really
coming
up
the
river
which
we
were
going
down
if
the
rapids
continued
to
be
as
they
had
been
it
could
not
be
much
more
than
three
weeks
before
we
were
in
straits
for
food
aside
from
the
danger
of
accident
in
the
rapids
and
if
our
progress
were
no
faster
than
it
had
been
and
we
were
straining
to
do
our
best
we
would
in
such
event
still
have
several
hundreds
of
kilometres
of
unknown
river
before
us
we
could
not
even
hazard
a
guess
at
what
was
in
front
the
river
was
now
a
really
big
river
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
flow
either
into
the
or
the
tapajos
it
was
possible
that
it
went
into
the
canuma
a
big
affluent
of
the
madeira
low
down
and
next
to
the
tapajos
it
was
more
probable
that
it
was
the
headwaters
of
the
aripuanan
a
river
which
as
i
have
said
was
not
even
named
on
the
excellent
english
map
of
brazil
i
carried
nothing
but
the
mouth
had
been
known
to
any
geographer
but
the
lower
course
had
long
been
known
to
and
recently
a
commission
from
the
government
of
amazonas
had
partway
ascended
one
branch
of
it
not
as
far
as
the
had
gone
and
as
it
turned
out
not
the
branch
we
came
down
two
of
our
men
were
down
with
fever
another
man
julio
a
fellow
of
powerful
frame
was
utterly
worthless
being
an
inborn
lazy
shirk
with
the
heart
of
a
ferocious
cur
in
the
body
of
a
bullock
the
others
were
good
men
some
of
them
very
good
indeed
they
were
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
pedrinho
craveiro
who
was
in
every
way
this
camp
was
very
lovely
it
was
on
the
edge
of
a
bay
into
which
the
river
broadened
immediately
below
the
rapids
there
was
a
beach
of
white
sand
where
we
bathed
and
washed
our
clothes
all
around
us
and
across
the
bay
and
on
both
sides
of
the
long
made
by
the
river
rose
the
splendid
forest
there
were
flocks
of
parakeets
colored
green
blue
and
red
big
toucans
called
overhead
lustrous
in
color
with
white
throats
red
gorgets
tail
coverts
and
huge
bills
here
the
soil
was
fertile
it
will
be
a
fine
site
for
a
when
this
region
is
open
to
settlement
surely
such
a
rich
and
fertile
land
can
not
be
permitted
to
remain
idle
to
lie
as
a
tenantless
wilderness
while
there
are
such
teeming
swarms
of
human
beings
in
the
overcrowded
countries
of
the
old
world
the
very
rapids
and
waterfalls
which
now
make
the
navigation
of
the
river
so
difficult
and
dangerous
would
drive
electric
trolleys
up
and
down
its
whole
length
and
far
out
on
either
side
and
run
mills
and
factories
and
lighten
the
labor
on
farms
with
the
incoming
of
settlement
and
with
the
steady
growth
of
knowledge
how
to
fight
and
control
tropical
diseases
fear
of
danger
to
health
would
vanish
a
land
like
this
is
a
hard
land
for
the
first
explorers
and
perhaps
for
their
immediate
followers
but
not
for
the
people
who
come
after
them
in
we
were
once
more
in
the
canoes
but
we
had
paddled
with
the
current
only
a
few
minutes
we
had
gone
only
a
kilometre
when
the
roar
of
rapids
in
front
again
forced
us
to
haul
up
to
the
bank
as
usual
rondon
lyra
and
kermit
with
antonio
correa
explored
both
sides
while
camp
was
being
pitched
the
rapids
were
longer
and
of
steeper
descent
than
the
last
but
on
the
opposite
or
western
side
there
was
a
passage
down
which
we
thought
we
could
get
the
empty
dugouts
at
the
cost
of
dragging
them
only
a
few
yards
at
one
spot
the
loads
were
to
be
carried
down
the
hither
bank
for
a
kilometre
to
the
smooth
water
the
river
foamed
between
great
rounded
masses
of
rock
and
at
one
point
there
was
a
sheer
fall
of
six
or
eight
feet
we
found
and
ate
wild
pineapples
wild
beans
were
in
flower
at
dinner
we
had
a
toucan
and
a
couple
of
parrots
which
were
very
good
all
next
day
was
spent
by
lyra
in
superintending
our
three
best
watermen
as
they
took
the
canoes
down
the
west
side
of
the
rapids
to
the
foot
at
the
spot
to
which
the
camp
had
meantime
been
shifted
in
the
forest
some
of
the
huge
sipas
or
rope
vines
which
were
as
big
as
cables
bore
clusters
of
fragrant
flowers
the
men
found
several
and
fruits
of
various
kinds
and
small
cocoanuts
they
chopped
down
an
ample
number
of
palms
for
the
and
most
important
of
all
they
gathered
a
quantity
of
big
which
when
roasted
tasted
like
the
best
of
chestnuts
and
are
nutritious
and
they
caught
a
number
of
big
piranhas
which
were
good
eating
so
we
all
had
a
feast
and
everybody
had
enough
to
eat
and
was
happy
by
these
rapids
at
the
fall
cherrie
found
some
strange
carvings
on
a
bare
mass
of
rock
they
were
evidently
made
by
men
a
long
time
ago
as
far
as
is
known
the
indians
thereabouts
make
no
such
figures
now
they
were
in
two
groups
one
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
facing
the
land
the
other
on
that
facing
the
water
the
latter
were
nearly
obliterated
the
former
were
in
good
preservation
the
figures
sharply
cut
into
the
rock
they
consisted
upon
the
upper
flat
part
of
the
rock
of
four
multiple
circles
with
a
dot
in
the
middle
o
very
accurately
made
and
about
a
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
below
them
on
the
side
of
the
rock
four
multiple
m
or
inverted
w
m
what
these
curious
symbols
represented
or
who
made
them
we
could
not
of
course
form
the
slightest
idea
it
may
be
that
in
a
very
remote
past
some
indian
tribes
of
comparatively
advanced
culture
had
penetrated
to
this
lovely
river
just
as
we
had
now
come
to
it
before
white
men
came
to
south
america
there
had
already
existed
therein
various
some
rude
others
fairly
advanced
which
rose
flourished
and
persisted
through
immemorial
ages
and
then
vanished
the
vicissitudes
in
the
history
of
humanity
during
its
stay
on
this
southern
continent
have
been
as
strange
varied
and
inexplicable
as
paleontology
shows
to
have
been
the
case
on
the
same
continent
in
the
history
of
the
higher
forms
of
animal
life
during
the
age
of
mammals
colonel
rondon
stated
that
such
figures
as
these
are
not
found
anywhere
else
in
matto
grosso
where
he
has
been
and
therefore
it
was
all
the
more
strange
to
find
them
in
this
one
place
on
the
unknown
river
never
before
visited
by
white
men
which
we
were
descending
next
morning
we
went
about
three
kilometers
before
coming
to
some
steep
hills
beautiful
to
look
upon
clad
as
they
were
in
dense
tall
tropical
forest
but
ominous
of
new
rapids
sure
enough
at
their
foot
we
had
to
haul
up
and
prepare
for
a
long
portage
the
canoes
we
ran
down
empty
even
so
we
were
within
an
ace
of
losing
two
the
lashed
couple
in
which
i
ordinarily
journeyed
in
a
sharp
bend
of
the
rapids
between
two
big
curls
they
were
swept
among
the
boulders
and
under
the
matted
branches
which
stretched
out
from
the
bank
they
filled
and
the
racing
current
pinned
them
where
they
were
one
partly
on
the
other
all
of
us
had
to
help
get
them
clear
their
fastenings
were
chopped
asunder
with
axes
kermit
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
men
stripped
to
the
skin
made
their
way
to
a
small
rock
island
in
the
little
falls
just
above
the
canoes
and
let
down
a
rope
which
we
tied
to
the
outermost
canoe
the
rest
of
us
up
to
our
armpits
and
barely
able
to
keep
our
footing
as
we
slipped
and
stumbled
among
the
boulders
in
the
swift
current
lifted
and
shoved
while
kermit
and
his
men
pulled
the
rope
and
fastened
the
slack
to
a
tree
each
canoe
in
succession
was
hauled
up
the
little
rock
island
baled
and
then
taken
down
in
safety
by
two
paddlers
it
was
nearly
four
before
we
were
again
ready
to
start
having
been
delayed
by
a
storm
so
heavy
that
we
could
not
see
across
the
river
ten
run
took
us
to
the
head
of
another
series
of
rapids
the
exploring
party
returned
with
the
news
that
we
had
an
all
day
job
ahead
of
us
and
we
made
camp
in
the
rain
which
did
not
matter
much
as
we
were
already
drenched
through
it
was
impossible
with
the
wet
wood
to
make
a
fire
sufficiently
hot
to
dry
all
our
soggy
things
for
the
rain
was
still
falling
a
tapir
was
seen
from
our
boat
but
as
at
the
moment
we
were
being
whisked
round
in
a
complete
circle
by
a
whirlpool
i
did
not
myself
see
it
in
time
to
shoot
next
morning
we
went
down
a
kilometre
and
then
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
canoes
were
run
down
and
the
loads
carried
to
the
other
side
of
a
little
river
coming
in
from
the
west
which
colonel
rondon
christened
cherrie
river
across
this
we
went
on
a
bridge
consisting
of
a
huge
tree
felled
by
macario
one
of
our
best
men
here
we
camped
while
rondon
lyra
kermit
and
antonio
correa
explored
what
was
ahead
they
were
absent
until
then
they
returned
with
the
news
that
we
were
among
ranges
of
low
mountains
utterly
different
in
formation
from
the
high
plateau
region
to
which
the
first
rapids
those
we
had
come
to
on
the
of
march
belonged
through
the
first
range
of
these
mountains
the
river
ran
in
a
gorge
some
three
kilometres
long
immediately
ahead
of
us
the
ground
was
so
rough
and
steep
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
drag
the
canoes
over
it
and
difficult
enough
to
carry
the
loads
and
the
rapids
were
so
bad
containing
several
falls
one
of
at
least
ten
metres
in
height
that
it
was
doubtful
how
many
of
the
canoes
we
could
get
down
them
kermit
who
was
the
only
man
with
much
experience
of
rope
work
was
the
only
man
who
believed
we
could
get
the
canoes
down
at
all
and
it
was
of
course
possible
that
we
should
have
to
build
new
ones
at
the
foot
to
supply
the
place
of
any
that
were
lost
or
left
behind
in
view
of
the
length
and
character
of
the
portage
and
of
all
the
unpleasant
possibilities
that
were
ahead
and
of
the
need
of
keeping
every
pound
of
food
it
was
necessary
to
reduce
weight
in
every
possible
way
and
to
throw
away
everything
except
the
barest
necessities
we
thought
we
had
reduced
our
baggage
before
but
now
we
cut
to
the
bone
we
kept
the
fly
for
all
six
of
us
to
sleep
under
kermit
shoes
had
gone
thanks
to
the
amount
of
work
in
the
water
which
he
had
been
doing
and
he
took
the
pair
i
had
been
wearing
while
i
put
on
my
spare
pair
in
addition
to
the
clothes
i
wore
i
kept
one
set
of
pajamas
a
spare
pair
of
drawers
a
spare
pair
of
socks
half
a
dozen
handkerchiefs
my
my
pocket
and
a
little
bag
containing
my
spare
spectacles
some
adhesive
plaster
some
needles
and
thread
the
and
my
purse
and
letter
of
credit
to
be
used
at
manaos
all
of
these
went
into
the
bag
containing
my
cot
blanket
and
i
also
carried
a
containing
my
cartridges
and
gauntlets
kermit
cut
down
even
closer
and
the
others
about
as
close
the
last
three
days
of
march
we
spent
in
getting
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
in
this
gorge
lyra
and
kermit
with
four
of
the
best
watermen
handled
the
empty
canoes
the
work
was
not
only
difficult
and
laborious
in
the
extreme
but
hazardous
for
the
walls
of
the
gorge
were
so
sheer
that
at
the
worst
places
they
had
to
cling
to
narrow
shelves
on
the
face
of
the
rock
while
letting
the
canoes
down
with
ropes
meanwhile
rondon
surveyed
and
cut
a
trail
for
the
bearers
and
superintended
the
portage
of
the
loads
the
rocky
sides
of
the
gorge
were
too
steep
for
laden
men
to
attempt
to
traverse
them
accordingly
the
trail
had
to
go
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
both
the
ascent
and
the
descent
of
the
slopes
being
very
steep
it
was
hard
work
to
carry
loads
over
such
a
trail
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
there
was
a
beautiful
view
of
the
country
ahead
all
around
and
in
front
of
us
there
were
ranges
of
low
mountains
about
the
height
of
the
lower
ridges
of
the
alleghenies
their
sides
were
steep
and
they
were
covered
with
the
matted
growth
of
the
tropical
forest
our
next
at
the
foot
of
the
gorge
was
almost
beneath
us
and
from
thence
the
river
ran
in
a
straight
line
flecked
with
white
water
for
about
a
kilometre
then
it
disappeared
behind
and
between
mountain
ridges
which
we
supposed
meant
further
rapids
it
was
a
view
well
worth
seeing
but
beautiful
although
the
country
ahead
of
us
was
its
character
was
such
as
to
promise
further
hardships
difficulty
and
exhausting
labor
and
especially
further
delay
and
delay
was
a
serious
matter
to
men
whose
food
supply
was
beginning
to
run
short
whose
equipment
was
reduced
to
the
minimum
who
for
a
month
with
the
utmost
toil
had
made
very
slow
progress
and
who
had
no
idea
of
either
the
distance
or
the
difficulties
of
the
route
in
front
of
them
there
was
not
much
life
in
the
woods
big
or
little
small
birds
were
rare
although
cherrie
unwearied
efforts
were
rewarded
from
time
to
time
by
a
species
new
to
the
collection
there
were
tracks
of
tapir
deer
and
agouti
and
if
we
had
taken
two
or
three
days
to
devote
to
nothing
else
than
hunting
them
we
might
perchance
have
killed
something
but
the
chance
was
much
too
uncertain
the
work
we
were
doing
was
too
hard
and
wearing
and
the
need
of
pressing
forward
altogether
too
great
to
permit
us
to
spend
any
time
in
such
manner
the
hunting
had
to
come
in
incidentally
this
type
of
well
nigh
impenetrable
forest
is
the
one
in
which
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
even
what
little
game
exists
therein
a
couple
of
curassows
and
a
big
monkey
were
killed
by
the
colonel
and
kermit
on
the
day
the
monkey
was
brought
in
lyra
kermit
and
their
four
associates
had
spent
from
sunrise
to
sunset
in
severe
and
at
moments
dangerous
toil
among
the
rocks
and
in
the
swift
water
and
the
fresh
meat
was
appreciated
the
head
feet
tail
skin
and
entrails
were
boiled
for
the
gaunt
and
ravenous
dogs
the
flesh
gave
each
of
us
a
few
mouthfuls
and
how
good
those
mouthfuls
tasted
cherrie
in
addition
to
being
out
after
birds
in
every
spare
moment
helped
in
all
emergencies
he
was
a
veteran
in
the
work
of
the
tropic
wilderness
we
talked
together
often
and
of
many
things
for
our
views
of
life
and
of
a
man
duty
to
his
wife
and
children
to
other
men
and
to
women
and
to
the
state
in
peace
and
war
were
in
all
essentials
the
same
his
father
had
served
all
through
the
civil
war
entering
an
iowa
cavalry
regiment
as
a
private
and
coming
out
as
a
captain
his
was
shattered
by
a
blow
from
a
in
fighting
at
shiloh
during
this
portage
the
weather
favored
us
we
were
coming
toward
the
close
of
the
rainy
season
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
when
we
moved
camp
to
the
foot
of
the
gorge
there
was
a
but
on
the
whole
we
were
not
bothered
by
rain
until
the
last
night
when
it
rained
heavily
driving
under
the
fly
so
as
to
wet
my
cot
and
bedding
however
i
slept
comfortably
enough
rolled
in
the
damp
blanket
without
the
blanket
i
should
have
been
uncomfortable
a
blanket
is
a
necessity
for
health
on
the
third
day
lyra
and
kermit
with
their
daring
and
watermen
after
wearing
labor
succeeded
in
getting
five
canoes
through
the
worst
of
the
rapids
to
the
chief
fall
the
sixth
which
was
frail
and
weak
had
its
bottom
beaten
out
on
the
jagged
rocks
of
the
broken
water
on
this
night
although
i
thought
i
had
put
my
clothes
out
of
reach
both
the
termites
and
the
carregadores
ants
got
at
them
ate
holes
in
one
boot
ate
one
leg
of
my
drawers
and
riddled
my
handkerchief
and
i
now
had
nothing
to
replace
anything
that
was
destroyed
next
day
lyra
kermit
and
their
camaradas
brought
the
five
canoes
that
were
left
down
to
camp
they
had
in
four
days
accomplished
a
work
of
incredible
labor
and
of
the
utmost
importance
for
at
the
first
glance
it
had
seemed
an
absolute
impossibility
to
avoid
abandoning
the
canoes
when
we
found
that
the
river
sank
into
a
cataract
broken
torrent
at
the
bottom
of
a
gorge
between
steep
mountains
on
april
we
once
more
started
wondering
how
soon
we
should
strike
other
rapids
in
the
mountains
ahead
and
whether
in
any
reasonable
time
we
should
as
the
aneroid
indicated
be
so
low
down
that
we
should
necessarily
be
in
a
plain
where
we
could
make
a
journey
of
at
least
a
few
days
without
rapids
we
had
been
exactly
a
month
going
through
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
rapids
during
that
month
we
had
come
only
about
kilometres
and
had
descended
nearly
metres
the
figures
are
approximate
but
fairly
accurate
we
had
lost
four
of
the
canoes
with
which
we
started
and
one
other
which
we
had
built
and
the
life
of
one
man
and
the
life
of
a
dog
which
by
its
death
had
in
all
probability
saved
the
life
of
colonel
rondon
in
a
straight
line
northward
toward
our
supposed
destination
we
had
not
made
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
a
day
at
the
cost
of
bitter
toil
for
most
of
the
party
of
much
risk
for
some
of
the
party
and
of
some
risk
and
some
hardship
for
all
the
party
most
of
the
camaradas
were
downhearted
naturally
enough
and
occasionally
asked
one
of
us
if
we
really
believed
that
we
should
ever
get
out
alive
and
we
had
to
cheer
them
up
as
best
we
could
there
was
no
change
in
our
work
for
the
time
being
we
made
but
three
kilometres
that
day
most
of
the
party
walked
all
the
time
but
the
dugouts
carried
the
luggage
until
we
struck
the
head
of
the
series
of
rapids
which
were
to
take
up
the
next
two
or
three
days
the
river
rushed
through
a
wild
gorge
a
chasm
or
canyon
between
two
mountains
its
sides
were
very
steep
mere
rock
walls
although
in
most
places
so
covered
with
the
luxuriant
growth
of
the
trees
and
bushes
that
clung
in
the
crevices
and
with
green
moss
that
the
naked
rock
was
hardly
seen
rondon
lyra
and
kermit
who
were
in
front
found
a
small
level
spot
with
a
beach
of
sand
and
sent
back
word
to
camp
there
while
they
spent
several
hours
in
exploring
the
country
ahead
the
canoes
were
run
down
empty
and
the
loads
carried
painfully
along
the
face
of
the
cliffs
so
bad
was
the
trail
that
i
found
it
rather
hard
to
follow
although
carrying
nothing
but
my
rifle
and
cartridge
bag
the
explorers
returned
with
the
information
that
the
mountains
stretched
ahead
of
us
and
that
there
were
rapids
as
far
as
they
had
gone
we
could
only
hope
that
the
aneroid
was
not
hopelessly
out
of
kilter
and
that
we
should
therefore
fairly
soon
find
ourselves
in
comparatively
level
country
the
severe
toil
on
a
rather
limited
food
supply
was
telling
on
the
strength
as
well
as
on
the
spirits
of
the
men
lyra
and
kermit
in
addition
to
their
other
work
performed
as
much
actual
physical
labor
as
any
of
them
next
day
the
of
april
we
began
the
descent
of
these
sinister
rapids
of
the
chasm
colonel
rondon
had
gone
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
in
order
to
find
a
better
trail
for
the
but
it
was
hopeless
and
they
had
to
go
along
the
face
of
the
cliffs
such
an
exploring
expedition
as
that
in
which
we
were
engaged
of
necessity
involves
hard
and
dangerous
labor
and
perils
of
many
kinds
to
follow
an
unknown
river
broken
by
innumerable
cataracts
and
rapids
rushing
through
mountains
of
which
the
existence
has
never
been
even
guessed
bears
no
resemblance
whatever
to
following
even
a
fairly
dangerous
river
which
has
been
thoroughly
explored
and
has
become
in
some
sort
a
highway
so
that
experienced
pilots
can
be
secured
as
guides
while
the
portages
have
been
pioneered
and
trails
chopped
out
and
every
dangerous
feature
of
the
rapids
is
known
beforehand
in
this
case
no
one
could
foretell
that
the
river
would
cleave
its
way
through
steep
mountain
chains
cutting
narrow
clefts
in
which
the
cliff
walls
rose
almost
sheer
on
either
hand
when
a
rushing
river
thus
canyons
as
we
used
to
say
out
west
and
the
mountains
are
very
steep
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
bring
the
canoes
down
the
river
itself
and
utterly
impossible
to
portage
them
along
the
cliff
sides
while
even
to
bring
the
loads
over
the
mountain
is
a
task
of
extraordinary
labor
and
difficulty
moreover
no
one
can
tell
how
many
times
the
task
will
have
to
be
repeated
or
when
it
will
end
or
whether
the
food
will
hold
out
every
hour
of
work
in
the
rapids
is
fraught
with
the
possibility
of
the
gravest
disaster
and
yet
it
is
imperatively
necessary
to
attempt
it
and
all
this
is
done
in
an
uninhabited
wilderness
or
else
a
wilderness
tenanted

genuine
wilderness
exploration

as
dangerous
as

the
conquest
of

from

heavy
toll

lyra
kermit
and
cherrie
with
four
of
the
men
worked
the
canoes
down
the
canyon
again
and
again
it
was
touch
and
go
whether
they
could
get
by
a
given
point
at
one
spot
the
channel
of
the
furious
torrent
was
only
fifteen
yards
across
one
canoe
was
lost
so
that
of
the
seven
with
which
we
had
started
only
two
were
left
cherrie
labored
with
the
other
men
at
times
and
also
stood
as
guard
over
them
for
while
actually
working
of
course
no
one
could
carry
a
rifle
kermit
experience
in
bridge
building
was
invaluable
in
enabling
him
to
do
the
rope
work
by
which
alone
it
was
possible
to
get
the
canoes
down
the
canyon
he
and
lyra
had
now
been
in
the
water
for
days
their
clothes
were
never
dry
their
shoes
were
rotten
the
bruises
on
their
feet
and
legs
had
become
sores
on
their
bodies
some
of
the
insect
bites
had
become
festering
wounds
as
indeed
was
the
case
with
all
of
us
poisonous
ants
biting
flies
ticks
wasps
bees
were
a
perpetual
torment
however
no
one
had
yet
been
bitten
by
a
venomous
serpent
a
scorpion
or
a
centipede
although
we
had
killed
all
of
the
three
within
camp
limits
under
such
conditions
whatever
is
evil
in
men
natures
comes
to
the
front
on
this
day
a
strange
and
terrible
tragedy
occurred
one
of
the
camaradas
a
man
of
pure
european
blood
was
the
man
named
julio
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
he
was
a
very
powerful
fellow
and
had
been
importunately
eager
to
come
on
the
expedition
and
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
worker
but
like
so
many
men
of
higher
standing
he
had
had
no
idea
of
what
such
an
expedition
really
meant
and
under
the
strain
of
toil
hardship
and
danger
his
nature
showed
its
true
depths
of
selfishness
cowardice
and
ferocity
he
shirked
all
work
he
shammed
sickness
nothing
could
make
him
do
his
share
and
yet
unlike
his
fellows
he
was
always
shamelessly
begging
for
favors
kermit
was
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
smoked
and
he
was
continually
giving
a
little
tobacco
to
some
of
the
camaradas
who
worked
especially
well
under
him
the
good
men
did
not
ask
for
it
but
julio
who
shirked
every
labor
was
always
and
always
in
vain
demanding
it
colonel
rondon
lyra
and
kermit
each
tried
to
get
work
out
of
him
and
in
order
to
do
anything
with
him
had
to
threaten
to
leave
him
in
the
wilderness
he
threw
all
his
tasks
on
his
comrades
and
moreover
he
stole
their
food
as
well
as
ours
on
such
an
expedition
the
theft
of
food
comes
next
to
murder
as
a
crime
and
should
by
rights
be
punished
as
such
we
could
not
trust
him
to
cut
down
palms
or
gather
nuts
because
he
would
stay
out
and
eat
what
ought
to
have
gone
into
the
common
store
finally
the
men
on
several
occasions
themselves
detected
him
stealing
their
food
alone
of
the
whole
party
and
thanks
to
the
stolen
food
he
had
kept
in
full
flesh
and
bodily
vigor
one
of
our
best
men
was
a
huge
negro
named
paixao
paishon
a
corporal
and
acting
sergeant
in
the
engineer
corps
he
had
by
the
way
literally
torn
his
trousers
to
pieces
so
that
he
wore
only
the
tatters
of
a
pair
of
old
drawers
until
i
gave
him
my
spare
trousers
when
we
lightened
loads
he
was
a
stern
disciplinarian
one
evening
he
detected
julio
stealing
food
and
smashed
him
in
the
mouth
julio
came
crying
to
us
his
face
working
with
fear
and
malignant
hatred
but
after
investigation
he
was
told
that
he
had
gotten
off
uncommonly
lightly
the
men
had
three
or
four
carbines
which
were
sometimes
carried
by
those
who
were
not
their
owners
on
this
morning
at
the
outset
of
the
portage
pedrinho
discovered
julio
stealing
some
of
the
men
dried
meat
shortly
afterward
paishon
rebuked
him
for
as
usual
lagging
behind
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
place
where
the
canoes
were
tied
to
the
bank
and
then
taken
down
one
at
a
time
we
were
sitting
down
waiting
for
the
last
loads
to
be
brought
along
the
trail
pedrinho
was
still
in
the
camp
we
had
left
paishon
had
just
brought
in
a
load
left
it
on
the
ground
with
his
carbine
beside
it
and
returned
on
the
trail
for
another
load
julio
came
in
put
down
his
load
picked
up
the
carbine
and
walked
back
on
the
trail
muttering
to
himself
but
showing
no
excitement
we
thought
nothing
of
it
for
he
was
always
muttering
and
occasionally
one
of
the
men
saw
a
monkey
or
big
bird
and
tried
to
shoot
it
so
it
was
never
surprising
to
see
a
man
with
a
carbine
in
a
minute
we
heard
a
shot
and
in
a
short
time
three
or
four
of
the
men
came
up
the
trail
to
tell
us
that
paishon
was
dead
having
been
shot
by
julio
who
had
fled
into
the
woods
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
were
ahead
i
sent
a
messenger
for
them
directed
cherrie
and
kermit
to
stay
where
they
were
and
guard
the
canoes
and
provisions
and
started
down
the
trail
with
the
doctor
an
absolutely
cool
and
plucky
man
with
a
revolver
but
no
rifle
and
a
couple
of
the
camaradas
we
soon
passed
the
dead
body
of
poor
paishon
he
lay
in
a
huddle
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
where
he
had
fallen
shot
through
the
heart
i
feared
that
julio
had
run
amuck
and
intended
merely
to
take
more
lives
before
he
died
and
that
he
would
begin
with
pedrinho
who
was
alone
and
unarmed
in
the
camp
we
had
left
accordingly
i
pushed
on
followed
by
my
companions
looking
sharply
right
and
left
but
when
we
came
to
the
camp
the
doctor
quietly
walked
by
me
remarking
my
eyes
are
better
than
yours
colonel
if
he
is
in
sight
i
point
him
out
to
you
as
you
have
the
rifle
however
he
was
not
there
and
the
others
soon
joined
us
with
the
welcome
news
that
they
had
found
the
carbine
the
murderer
had
stood
to
one
side
of
the
path
and
killed
his
victim
when
a
dozen
paces
off
with
deliberate
and
malignant
purpose
then
evidently
his
murderous
hatred
had
at
once
given
way
to
his
innate
cowardice
and
perhaps
hearing
some
one
coming
along
the
path
he
fled
in
panic
terror
into
the
wilderness
a
tree
had
knocked
the
carbine
from
his
hand
his
footsteps
showed
that
after
going
some
rods
he
had
started
to
return
doubtless
for
the
carbine
but
had
fled
again
probably
because
the
body
had
then
been
discovered
it
was
questionable
whether
or
not
he
would
live
to
reach
the
indian
villages
which
were
probably
his
goal
he
was
not
a
man
to
feel
remorse
never
a
common
feeling
but
surely
that
murderer
was
in
a
living
hell
as
with
fever
and
famine
leering
at
him
from
the
shadows
he
made
his
way
through
the
empty
desolation
of
the
wilderness
franca
the
cook
quoted
out
of
the
melancholy
proverbial
philosophy
of
the
people
the
proverb
no
man
knows
the
heart
of
any
one
and
then
expressed
with
deep
conviction
a
weird
ghostly
belief
i
had
never
encountered
before
paishon
is
following
julio
now
and
will
follow
him
until
he
dies
paishon
fell
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
when
a
murdered
man
falls
like
that
his
ghost
will
follow
the
slayer
as
long
as
the
slayer
lives
we
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
the
murderer
we
could
not
legally
put
him
to
death
although
he
was
a
soldier
who
in
cold
blood
had
just
deliberately
killed
a
fellow
soldier
if
we
had
been
near
civilization
we
would
have
done
our
best
to
bring
him
in
and
turn
him
over
to
justice
but
we
were
in
the
wilderness
and
how
many
weeks
journey
were
ahead
of
us
we
could
not
tell
our
food
was
running
low
sickness
was
beginning
to
appear
among
the
men
and
both
their
courage
and
their
strength
were
gradually
ebbing
our
first
duty
was
to
save
the
lives
and
the
health
of
the
men
of
the
expedition
who
had
honestly
been
performing
and
had
still
to
perform
so
much
perilous
labor
if
we
brought
the
murderer
in
he
would
have
to
be
guarded
night
and
day
on
an
expedition
where
there
were
always
loaded
firearms
about
and
where
there
would
continually
be
opportunity
and
temptation
for
him
to
make
an
effort
to
seize
food
and
a
weapon
and
escape
perhaps
murdering
some
other
good
man
he
could
not
be
shackled
while
climbing
along
the
cliff
slopes
he
could
not
be
shackled
in
the
canoes
where
there
was
always
chance
of
upset
and
drowning
and
standing
guard
would
be
an
additional
and
severe
penalty
on
the
weary
honest
men
already
exhausted
by
overwork
the
expedition
was
in
peril
and
it
was
wise
to
take
every
chance
possible
that
would
help
secure
success
whether
the
murderer
lived
or
died
in
the
wilderness
was
of
no
moment
compared
with
the
duty
of
doing
everything
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
rest
of
the
party
for
the
two
days
following
we
were
always
on
the
watch
against
his
return
for
he
could
have
readily
killed
some
one
else
by
rolling
rocks
down
on
any
of
the
men
working
on
the
cliff
sides
or
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
but
we
did
not
see
him
until
the
morning
of
the
third
day
we
had
passed
the
last
of
the
rapids
of
the
chasm
and
the
four
boats
were
going
when
he
appeared
behind
some
trees
on
the
bank
and
called
out
that
he
wished
to
surrender
and
be
taken
aboard
for
the
murderer
was
an
arrant
craven
at
heart
a
strange
mixture
of
ferocity
and
cowardice
colonel
rondon
boat
was
far
in
advance
he
did
not
stop
nor
answer
i
kept
on
in
similar
fashion
with
the
rear
boats
for
i
had
no
intention
of
taking
the
murderer
aboard
to
the
jeopardy
of
the
other
members
of
the
party
unless
colonel
rondon
told
me
that
it
would
have
to
be
done
in
pursuance
of
his
duty
as
an
officer
of
the
army
and
a
servant
of
the
government
of
brazil
at
the
first
halt
colonel
rondon
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
this
was
his
view
of
his
duty
but
that
he
had
not
stopped
because
he
wished
first
to
consult
me
as
the
chief
of
the
expedition
i
answered
that
for
the
reasons
enumerated
above
i
did
not
believe
that
in
justice
to
the
good
men
of
the
expedition
we
should
jeopardize
their
safety
by
taking
the
murderer
along
and
that
if
the
responsibility
were
mine
i
should
refuse
to
take
him
but
that
he
colonel
rondon
was
the
superior
officer
of
both
the
murderer
and
of
all
the
other
enlisted
men
and
army
officers
on
the
expedition
and
in
return
was
responsible
for
his
actions
to
his
own
governmental
superiors
and
to
the
laws
of
brazil
and
that
in
view
of
this
responsibility
he
must
act
as
his
sense
of
duty
bade
him
accordingly
at
the
next
camp
he
sent
back
two
men
expert
woodsmen
to
find
the
murderer
and
bring
him
in
they
failed
to
find
him
note
the
above
account
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
murder
was
read
to
and
approved
as
correct
by
all
six
members
of
the
expedition
i
have
anticipated
my
narrative
because
i
do
not
wish
to
recur
to
the
horror
more
than
is
necessary
i
now
return
to
my
story
after
we
found
that
julio
had
fled
we
returned
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
the
murdered
man
lay
with
a
handkerchief
thrown
over
his
face
we
buried
him
beside
the
place
where
he
fell
with
axes
and
knives
the
camaradas
dug
a
shallow
grave
while
we
stood
by
with
bared
heads
then
reverently
and
carefully
we
lifted
the
poor
body
which
but
half
an
hour
before
had
been
so
full
of
vigorous
life
colonel
rondon
and
i
bore
the
head
and
shoulders
we
laid
him
in
the
grave
and
heaped
a
mound
over
him
and
put
a
rude
cross
at
his
head
we
fired
a
volley
for
a
brave
and
loyal
soldier
who
had
died
doing
his
duty
then
we
left
him
forever
under
the
great
trees
beside
the
lonely
river
that
day
we
got
only
down
the
rapids
there
was
no
good
place
to
camp
but
at
the
foot
of
one
steep
cliff
there
was
a
narrow
slope
where
it
was
possible
to
sling
hammocks
and
cook
and
a
slanting
spot
was
found
for
my
cot
which
had
sagged
until
by
this
time
it
looked
like
a
centipede
it
rained
a
little
during
the
night
but
not
enough
to
wet
us
much
next
day
lyra
kermit
and
cherrie
finished
their
job
and
brought
the
four
remaining
canoes
to
camp
one
leaking
badly
from
the
battering
on
the
rocks
we
then
went
a
few
hundred
yards
and
camped
on
the
opposite
side
it
was
not
a
good
but
it
was
better
than
the
one
we
left
the
men
were
growing
constantly
weaker
under
the
endless
strain
of
exhausting
labor
kermit
was
having
an
attack
of
fever
and
lyra
and
cherrie
had
touches
of
dysentery
but
all
three
continued
to
work
while
in
the
water
trying
to
help
with
an
upset
canoe
i
had
by
my
own
clumsiness
bruised
my
leg
against
a
boulder
and
the
resulting
inflammation
was
somewhat
bothersome
i
now
had
a
sharp
attack
of
fever
but
thanks
to
the
excellent
care
of
the
doctor
was
over
it
in
about
hours
but
kermit
fever
grew
worse
and
he
too
was
unable
to
work
for
a
day
or
two
we
could
walk
over
the
portages
however
a
good
doctor
is
an
absolute
necessity
on
an
exploring
expedition
in
such
a
country
as
that
we
were
in
under
penalty
of
a
frightful
mortality
among
the
members
and
the
necessary
risks
and
hazards
are
so
great
the
chances
of
disaster
so
large
that
there
is
no
warrant
for
increasing
them
by
the
failure
to
take
all
feasible
precautions
the
next
day
we
made
another
long
portage
round
some
rapids
and
camped
at
night
still
in
the
hot
wet
sunless
atmosphere
of
the
gorge
the
following
day
april
we
portaged
past
another
set
of
rapids
which
proved
to
be
the
last
of
the
rapids
of
the
chasm
for
some
kilometres
we
kept
passing
hills
and
feared
lest
at
any
moment
we
might
again
find
ourselves
fronting
another
mountain
gorge
with
in
such
case
further
days
of
grinding
and
perilous
labor
ahead
of
us
while
our
men
were
disheartened
weak
and
sick
most
of
them
had
already
begun
to
have
fever
their
condition
was
inevitable
after
over
a
month
uninterrupted
work
of
the
hardest
kind
in
getting
through
the
long
series
of
rapids
we
had
just
passed
and
a
long
further
delay
accompanied
by
wearing
labor
would
have
almost
certainly
meant
that
the
weakest
among
our
party
would
have
begun
to
die
there
were
already
two
of
the
camaradas
who
were
too
weak
to
help
the
others
their
condition
being
such
as
to
cause
us
serious
concern
however
the
hills
gradually
sank
into
a
level
plain
and
the
river
carried
us
through
it
at
a
rate
that
enabled
us
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
to
reel
off
kilometres
a
record
that
for
the
first
time
held
out
promise
twice
tapirs
swam
the
river
while
we
passed
but
not
near
my
canoe
however
the
previous
evening
cherrie
had
killed
two
monkeys
and
kermit
one
and
we
all
had
a
few
mouthfuls
of
fresh
meat
we
had
already
had
a
good
soup
made
out
of
a
turtle
kermit
had
caught
we
had
to
portage
by
one
short
set
of
rapids
the
unloaded
canoes
being
brought
down
without
difficulty
at
last
at
four
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
big
river
running
in
from
the
right
we
thought
it
was
probably
the
ananas
but
of
course
could
not
be
certain
it
was
less
in
volume
than
the
one
we
had
descended
but
nearly
as
broad
its
breadth
at
this
point
being
yards
as
against
one
hundred
and
twenty
for
the
larger
river
there
were
rapids
ahead
immediately
after
the
junction
which
took
place
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
we
had
come
kilometres
all
told
and
were
nearly
north
of
where
we
had
started
we
camped
on
the
point
of
land
between
the
two
rivers
it
was
extraordinary
to
realize
that
here
about
the
eleventh
degree
we
were
on
such
a
big
river
utterly
unknown
to
the
cartographers
and
not
indicated
by
even
a
hint
on
any
map
we
named
this
big
tributary
rio
cardozo
after
a
gallant
officer
of
the
commission
who
had
died
of
beriberi
just
as
our
expedition
began
we
spent
a
day
at
this
spot
determining
our
exact
position
by
the
sun
and
afterward
by
the
stars
and
sending
on
two
men
to
explore
the
rapids
in
advance
they
returned
with
the
news
that
there
were
big
cataracts
in
them
and
that
they
would
form
an
obstacle
to
our
progress
they
had
also
caught
a
huge
iluroid
fish
which
furnished
an
excellent
meal
for
everybody
in
camp
this
evening
at
sunset
the
view
across
the
broad
river
from
our
camp
where
the
two
rivers
joined
was
very
lovely
and
for
the
first
time
we
had
an
open
space
in
front
of
and
above
us
so
that
after
nightfall
the
stars
and
the
great
waxing
moon
were
glorious
and
against
the
rocks
in
midstream
the
broken
water
gleamed
like
tossing
silver
the
huge
catfish
which
the
men
had
caught
was
over
three
feet
and
a
half
long
with
the
usual
enormous
head
out
of
all
proportions
to
the
body
and
the
enormous
mouth
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
head
such
fish
although
their
teeth
are
small
swallow
very
large
prey
this
one
contained
the
nearly
digested
remains
of
a
monkey
probably
the
monkey
had
been
seized
while
drinking
from
the
end
of
a
branch
and
once
engulfed
in
that
yawning
cavern
there
was
no
escape
we
americans
were
astounded
at
the
idea
of
a
catfish
making
prey
of
a
monkey
but
our
brazilian
friends
told
us
that
in
the
lower
madeira
and
the
part
of
the
amazon
near
its
mouth
there
is
a
still
more
gigantic
catfish
which
in
similar
fashion
occasionally
makes
prey
of
man
this
is
a
fish
over
nine
feet
long
with
the
usual
disproportionately
large
head
and
gaping
mouth
with
a
circle
of
small
teeth
for
the
engulfing
mouth
itself
is
the
danger
not
the
teeth
it
is
called
the
piraiba
pronounced
in
four
syllables
while
stationed
at
the
small
city
of
itacoatiara
on
the
amazon
at
the
mouth
of
the
madeira
the
doctor
had
seen
one
of
these
monsters
which
had
been
killed
by
the
two
men
it
had
attacked
they
were
fishing
in
a
canoe
when
it
rose
from
the
bottom
for
it
is
a
ground
fish
and
raising
itself
half
out
of
the
water
lunged
over
the
edge
of
the
canoe
at
them
with
open
mouth
they
killed
it
with
their
falcons
as
machetes
are
called
in
brazil
it
was
taken
round
the
city
in
triumph
in
an
oxcart
the
doctor
saw
it
and
said
it
was
three
metres
long
he
said
that
swimmers
feared
it
even
more
than
the
big
cayman
because
they
could
see
the
latter
whereas
the
former
lay
hid
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
colonel
rondon
said
that
in
many
villages
where
he
had
been
on
the
lower
madeira
the
people
had
built
stockaded
enclosures
in
the
water
in
which
they
bathed
not
venturing
to
swim
in
the
open
water
for
fear
of
the
piraiba
and
the
big
cayman
next
day
april
we
made
five
kilometres
only
as
there
was
a
succession
of
rapids
we
had
to
carry
the
loads
past
two
of
them
but
ran
the
canoes
without
difficulty
for
on
the
west
side
were
long
canals
of
swift
water
through
the
forest
the
river
had
been
higher
but
was
still
very
high
and
the
current
raced
round
the
many
islands
that
at
this
point
divided
the
channel
at
four
we
made
camp
at
the
head
of
another
stretch
of
rapids
over
which
the
canadian
canoes
would
have
danced
without
shipping
a
teaspoonful
of
water
but
which
our
dugouts
could
only
run
empty
cherrie
killed
three
monkeys
and
lyra
caught
two
big
piranhas
so
that
we
were
again
all
of
us
well
provided
with
dinner
and
breakfast
when
a
number
of
men
doing
hard
work
are
most
of
the
time
on
they
grow
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
any
reasonably
full
meal
that
does
arrive
on
the
we
repeated
the
proceedings
a
short
quick
run
a
few
hundred
metres
portage
occupying
however
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
again
a
few
minutes
run
again
other
rapids
we
again
made
less
than
five
kilometres
in
the
two
days
we
had
been
descending
nearly
a
metre
for
every
kilometre
we
made
in
advance
and
it
hardly
seemed
as
if
this
state
of
things
could
last
for
the
aneroid
showed
that
we
were
getting
very
low
down
how
i
longed
for
a
big
maine
such
as
that
in
which
i
once
went
down
the
mattawamkeag
at
high
water
it
would
have
slipped
down
these
rapids
as
a
girl
trips
through
a
country
dance
but
our
loaded
dugouts
would
have
shoved
their
noses
under
every
curl
the
country
was
lovely
the
wide
river
now
in
one
channel
now
in
several
channels
wound
among
hills
the
forest
glistened
in
the
sunlight
the
many
kinds
of
beautiful
and
the
huge
stamped
the
peculiar
look
of
the
tropics
on
the
whole
landscape
it
was
like
passing
by
water
through
a
gigantic
botanical
garden
in
the
afternoon
we
got
an
elderly
toucan
a
piranha
and
a
reasonably
edible
turtle
so
we
had
fresh
meat
again
we
slept
as
usual
in
earshot
of
rapids
we
had
been
out
six
weeks
and
almost
all
the
time
we
had
been
engaged
in
wearily
working
our
own
way
down
and
past
rapid
after
rapid
rapids
are
by
far
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
explorers
and
travellers
who
journey
along
these
rivers
next
day
was
a
repetition
of
the
same
work
all
the
morning
was
spent
in
getting
the
loads
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
at
the
head
of
which
we
were
encamped
down
which
the
canoes
were
run
empty
then
for
thirty
or
forty
minutes
we
ran
down
the
swift
twisting
river
the
two
lashed
canoes
almost
coming
to
grief
at
one
spot
where
a
swirl
of
the
current
threw
them
against
some
trees
on
a
small
submerged
island
then
we
came
to
another
set
of
rapids
carried
the
baggage
down
past
them
and
made
camp
long
after
dark
in
the
rain
a
good
exercise
in
patience
for
those
of
us
who
were
still
suffering
somewhat
from
fever
no
one
was
in
really
buoyant
health
for
some
weeks
we
had
been
sharing
part
of
the
contents
of
our
boxes
with
the
camaradas
but
our
food
was
not
very
satisfying
to
them
they
needed
quantity
and
the
mainstay
of
each
of
their
meals
was
a
mass
of
palmitas
but
on
this
day
they
had
no
time
to
cut
down
palms
we
finally
decided
to
run
these
rapids
with
the
empty
canoes
and
they
came
down
in
safety
on
such
a
trip
it
is
highly
undesirable
to
take
any
save
necessary
risks
for
the
consequences
of
disaster
are
too
serious
and
yet
if
no
risks
are
taken
the
progress
is
so
slow
that
disaster
comes
anyhow
and
it
is
necessary
perpetually
to
vary
the
terms
of
the
perpetual
working
compromise
between
rashness
and
this
night
we
had
a
very
good
fish
to
eat
a
big
silvery
fellow
called
a
pescada
of
a
kind
we
had
not
caught
before
one
day
trigueiro
failed
to
embark
with
the
rest
of
us
and
we
had
to
camp
where
we
were
next
day
to
find
him
easter
sunday
we
spent
in
the
fashion
with
which
we
were
altogether
too
familiar
we
only
ran
in
a
clear
course
for
ten
minutes
all
told
and
spent
eight
hours
in
portaging
the
loads
past
rapids
down
which
the
canoes
were
run
the
balsa
was
almost
swamped
this
day
we
caught
big
fish
mostly
piranhas
and
everybody
had
all
he
could
eat
for
dinner
and
for
breakfast
the
following
morning
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
was
a
repetition
of
this
wearisome
work
but
late
in
the
afternoon
the
river
began
to
run
in
long
quiet
reaches
we
made
fifteen
kilometres
and
for
the
first
time
in
several
weeks
camped
where
we
did
not
hear
the
rapids
the
silence
was
soothing
and
restful
the
following
day
april
we
made
a
good
run
of
some
kilometres
we
passed
a
little
river
which
entered
on
our
left
we
ran
two
or
three
light
rapids
and
portaged
the
loads
by
another
the
river
ran
in
long
and
usually
tranquil
stretches
in
the
morning
when
we
started
the
view
was
lovely
there
was
a
mist
and
for
a
couple
of
miles
the
great
river
broad
and
quiet
ran
between
the
high
walls
of
tropical
forest
the
tops
of
the
giant
trees
showing
dim
through
the
haze
different
members
of
the
party
caught
many
fish
and
shot
a
monkey
and
a
couple
of
birds
kin
to
a
turkey
but
the
size
of
a
fowl
so
we
again
had
a
camp
of
plenty
the
dry
season
was
approaching
but
there
were
still
heavy
drenching
rains
on
this
day
the
men
found
some
new
nuts
of
which
they
liked
the
taste
but
the
nuts
proved
unwholesome
and
half
of
the
men
were
very
sick
and
unable
to
work
the
following
day
in
the
balsa
only
two
were
left
fit
to
do
anything
and
kermit
plied
a
paddle
all
day
long
accordingly
it
was
a
rather
sorry
crew
that
embarked
the
following
morning
april
but
it
turned
out
a
day
the
day
before
we
had
come
across
cuttings
a
year
old
which
were
probably
but
not
certainly
made
by
pioneer
rubbermen
but
on
this
day
during
which
we
made
kilometres
after
running
two
hours
and
a
half
we
found
on
the
left
bank
a
board
on
a
post
with
the
initials
j
to
show
the
farthest
up
point
which
a
rubberman
had
reached
and
claimed
as
his
own
an
hour
farther
down
we
came
on
a
newly
built
house
in
a
little
planted
clearing
and
we
cheered
heartily
no
one
was
at
home
but
the
house
of
palm
thatch
was
clean
and
cool
a
couple
of
dogs
were
on
watch
and
the
belongings
showed
that
a
man
a
woman
and
a
child
lived
there
and
had
only
just
left
another
hour
brought
us
to
a
similar
house
where
dwelt
an
old
black
man
who
showed
the
innate
courtesy
of
the
brazilian
peasant
we
came
on
these
rubbermen
and
their
houses
in
about
latitude
degrees
minutes
in
we
stopped
at
another
clean
cool
picturesque
house
of
palm
thatch
the
inhabitants
all
fled
at
our
approach
fearing
an
indian
raid
for
they
were
absolutely
unprepared
to
have
any
one
come
from
the
unknown
regions
they
returned
and
were
most
hospitable
and
communicative
and
we
spent
the
night
there
said
antonio
correa
to
kermit
it
seems
like
a
dream
to
be
in
a
house
again
and
hear
the
voices
of
men
and
women
instead
of
being
among
those
mountains
and
rapids
the
river
was
known
to
them
as
the
castanho
and
was
the
main
affluent
or
rather
the
left
or
western
branch
of
the
aripuanan
the
castanho
is
a
name
used
by
the
gatherers
only
it
is
unknown
to
the
geographers
we
were
according
to
our
informants
about
fifteen
days
journey
from
the
confluence
of
the
two
rivers
but
there
were
many
rubbermen
along
the
banks
some
of
whom
had
become
permanent
settlers
we
had
come
over
three
hundred
kilometres
in
days
over
absolutely
unknown
ground
we
had
seen
no
human
being
although
we
had
twice
heard
indians
six
weeks
had
been
spent
in
steadily
slogging
our
way
down
through
the
interminable
series
of
rapids
it
was
astonishing
before
when
we
were
on
a
river
of
about
the
size
of
the
upper
rhine
or
elbe
to
realize
that
no
geographer
had
any
idea
of
its
existence
but
after
all
no
civilized
man
of
any
grade
had
ever
been
on
it
here
however
was
a
river
with
people
dwelling
along
the
banks
some
of
whom
had
lived
in
the
neighborhood
for
eight
or
ten
years
and
yet
on
no
standard
map
was
there
a
hint
of
the
river
existence
we
were
putting
on
the
map
a
river
running
through
between
five
and
six
degrees
of
latitude
of
between
seven
and
eight
if
as
should
properly
be
done
the
lower
aripuanan
is
included
as
part
of
it
of
which
no
geographer
in
any
map
published
in
europe
or
the
united
states
or
brazil
had
even
admitted
the
possibility
of
the
existence
for
the
place
actually
occupied
by
it
was
filled
on
the
maps
by
other
imaginary
streams
or
by
mountain
ranges
before
we
started
the
amazonas
boundary
commission
had
come
up
the
lower
aripuanan
and
then
the
eastern
branch
or
upper
aripuanan
to
degrees
minutes
following
the
course
which
for
a
couple
of
decades
had
been
followed
by
the
rubbermen
but
not
going
as
high
an
employee
either
of
this
commission
or
of
one
of
the
big
rubbermen
had
been
up
the
castanho
which
is
easy
of
ascent
in
its
lower
course
to
about
the
same
latitude
not
going
nearly
as
high
as
the
rubbermen
had
gone
this
we
found
out
while
we
ourselves
were
descending
the
lower
castanho
the
lower
main
stream
and
the
lower
portion
of
its
main
affluent
the
castanho
had
been
commercial
highways
for
rubbermen
and
settlers
for
nearly
two
decades
and
as
we
speedily
found
were
as
easy
to
traverse
as
the
upper
stream
which
we
had
just
come
down
was
difficult
to
traverse
but
the
governmental
and
scientific
authorities
native
and
foreign
remained
in
complete
ignorance
and
the
rubbermen
themselves
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
headwaters
which
were
in
country
never
hitherto
traversed
by
civilized
men
evidently
the
castanho
was
in
length
at
least
substantially
equal
and
probably
superior
to
the
upper
aripuanan
it
now
seemed
even
more
likely
that
the
ananas
was
the
headwaters
of
the
main
stream
than
of
the
cardozo
for
the
first
time
this
great
river
the
greatest
affluent
of
the
madiera
was
to
be
put
on
the
map
and
the
understanding
of
its
real
position
and
real
relationship
and
the
clearing
up
of
the
complex
problem
of
the
sources
of
all
these
lower
affluents
of
the
madiera
was
rendered
possible
by
the
seven
weeks
of
hard
and
dangerous
labor
we
had
spent
in
going
down
an
absolutely
unknown
river
through
an
absolutely
unknown
wilderness
at
this
stage
of
the
growth
of
world
geography
i
esteemed
it
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
to
be
able
to
take
part
in
such
a
feat
a
feat
which
represented
the
capping
of
the
pyramid
which
during
the
previous
seven
years
had
been
built
by
the
labor
of
the
brazilian
telegraphic
commission
we
had
passed
the
period
when
there
was
a
chance
of
peril
of
disaster
to
the
whole
expedition
there
might
be
risk
ahead
to
individuals
and
some
difficulties
and
annoyances
for
all
of
us
but
there
was
no
longer
the
least
likelihood
of
any
disaster
to
the
expedition
as
a
whole
we
now
no
longer
had
to
face
continual
anxiety
the
need
of
constant
economy
with
food
the
duty
of
labor
with
no
end
in
sight
and
bitter
uncertainty
as
to
the
future
it
was
time
to
get
out
the
wearing
work
under
very
unhealthy
conditions
was
beginning
to
tell
on
every
one
half
of
the
camaradas
had
been
down
with
fever
and
were
much
weakened
only
a
few
of
them
retained
their
original
physical
and
moral
strength
cherrie
and
kermit
had
recovered
but
both
kermit
and
lyra
still
had
bad
sores
on
their
legs
from
the
bruises
received
in
the
water
work
i
was
in
worse
shape
the
after
effects
of
the
fever
still
hung
on
and
the
leg
which
had
been
hurt
while
working
in
the
rapids
with
the
sunken
canoe
had
taken
a
turn
for
the
bad
and
developed
an
abscess
the
good
doctor
to
whose
unwearied
care
and
kindness
i
owe
much
had
cut
it
open
and
inserted
a
drainage
tube
an
added
charm
being
given
the
operation
and
the
subsequent
dressings
by
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
piums
and
boroshudas
took
part
therein
i
could
hardly
hobble
and
was
pretty
well
laid
up
but
there
are
no
conductor
while
a
battery
changing
ground
no
man
has
any
business
to
go
on
such
a
trip
as
ours
unless
he
will
refuse
to
jeopardize
the
welfare
of
his
associates
by
any
delay
caused
by
a
weakness
or
ailment
of
his
it
is
his
duty
to
go
forward
if
necessary
on
all
fours
until
he
drops
fortunately
i
was
put
to
no
such
test
i
remained
in
good
shape
until
we
had
passed
the
last
of
the
rapids
of
the
chasms
when
my
serious
trouble
came
we
had
only
ahead
of
us
it
is
not
ideal
for
a
sick
man
to
spend
the
hottest
hours
of
the
day
stretched
on
the
boxes
in
the
bottom
of
a
small
open
dugout
under
the
intolerable
heat
of
the
torrid
sun
of
the
varied
by
blinding
drenching
downpours
of
rain
but
i
could
not
be
sufficiently
grateful
for
the
chance
kermit
and
cherrie
took
care
of
me
as
if
they
had
been
trained
nurses
and
colonel
rondon
and
lyra
were
no
less
thoughtful
the
north
was
calling
strongly
to
the
three
men
of
the
north
rocky
dell
farm
to
cherrie
sagamore
hill
to
me
and
to
kermit
the
call
was
stronger
still
after
nightfall
we
could
now
see
the
dipper
well
above
the
horizon
upside
down
with
the
two
pointers
pointing
to
a
north
star
below
the
world
rim
but
the
dipper
with
all
its
stars
in
our
home
country
spring
had
now
come
the
wonderful
northern
spring
of
long
glorious
days
of
brooding
twilights
of
cool
delightful
nights
robin
and
bluebird
and
song
sparrow
were
singing
in
the
mornings
at
home
the
were
red
windflowers
and
bloodroot
were
blooming
while
the
last
patches
of
snow
still
lingered
the
rapture
of
the
hermithrush
in
vermont
the
serene
golden
melody
of
the
woodthrush
on
long
island
would
be
heard
before
we
were
there
to
listen
each
man
to
his
home
and
to
his
true
love
each
was
longing
for
the
homely
things
that
were
so
dear
to
him
for
the
home
people
who
were
dearer
still
and
for
the
one
who
was
dearest
of
all
x
to
the
amazon
and
home
zoological
and
geographical
results
of
the
expedition
our
adventures
and
our
troubles
were
alike
over
we
now
experienced
the
incalculable
contrast
between
descending
a
known
and
travelled
river
and
one
that
is
utterly
unknown
after
four
days
we
hired
a
rubberman
to
go
with
us
as
guide
we
knew
exactly
what
channels
were
passable
when
we
came
to
the
rapids
when
the
canoes
had
to
unload
and
where
the
were
it
was
all
child
play
compared
to
what
we
had
gone
through
we
made
long
days
journeys
for
at
night
we
stopped
at
some
house
inhabited
or
abandoned
and
therefore
the
men
were
spared
the
labor
of
making
camp
and
we
bought
ample
food
for
them
so
there
was
no
further
need
of
fishing
and
chopping
down
palms
for
the
palmtops
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
blazing
but
it
looked
as
if
we
had
come
back
into
the
rainy
season
for
there
were
many
heavy
rains
usually
in
the
afternoon
but
sometimes
in
the
morning
or
at
night
the
mosquitoes
were
sometimes
rather
troublesome
at
night
in
the
daytime
the
piums
swarmed
and
often
bothered
us
even
when
we
were
in
midstream
for
four
days
there
were
no
rapids
we
could
not
run
without
unloading
then
on
the
we
got
a
canoe
from
senhor
barboso
he
was
a
most
kind
and
hospitable
man
who
also
gave
us
a
duck
and
a
chicken
and
some
mandioc
and
six
pounds
of
rice
and
would
take
no
payment
he
lived
in
a
roomy
house
with
his
dusky
wife
and
his
many
children
the
new
canoe
was
light
and
roomy
and
we
were
able
to
rig
up
a
low
shelter
under
which
i
could
lie
i
was
still
sick
at
noon
we
passed
the
mouth
of
a
big
river
the
rio
branco
coming
in
from
the
left
this
was
about
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
soon
afterward
we
came
to
the
first
serious
rapids
the
panela
we
carried
the
boats
past
ran
down
the
empty
canoes
and
camped
at
the
foot
in
a
roomy
house
the
doctor
bought
a
handsome
trumpeter
bird
very
friendly
and
confiding
which
was
thenceforth
my
canoe
companion
we
had
already
passed
many
inhabited
and
a
still
larger
number
of
uninhabited
houses
the
dwellers
were
rubbermen
but
generally
they
were
permanent
settlers
also
homemakers
with
their
wives
and
children
some
both
of
the
men
and
women
were
apparently
of
pure
negro
blood
or
of
pure
indian
or
south
european
blood
but
in
the
great
majority
all
three
strains
were
mixed
in
varying
degrees
they
were
most
friendly
courteous
and
hospitable
often
they
refused
payment
for
what
they
could
afford
out
of
their
little
to
give
us
when
they
did
charge
the
prices
were
very
high
as
was
but
just
for
they
live
back
of
the
beyond
and
everything
costs
them
fabulously
save
what
they
raise
themselves
the
cool
bare
houses
of
poles
and
palm
thatch
contained
little
except
hammocks
and
a
few
simple
cooking
utensils
and
often
a
clock
or
sewing
machine
or
winchester
rifle
from
our
own
country
they
often
had
flowers
planted
including
fragrant
roses
their
only
live
stock
except
the
dogs
were
a
few
chickens
and
ducks
they
planted
patches
of
mandioc
maize
sugarcane
rice
beans
squashes
pineapples
bananas
lemons
oranges
melons
peppers
and
various
purely
native
fruits
and
vegetables
such
as
the
kniabo
a
growing
on
the
branches
of
a
high
bush
which
is
cooked
with
meat
they
get
some
game
from
the
forest
and
more
fish
from
the
river
there
is
no
representative
of
the
government
among
them
indeed
even
now
their
very
existence
is
barely
known
to
the
governmental
authorities
and
the
church
has
ignored
them
as
completely
as
the
state
when
they
wish
to
get
married
they
have
to
spend
several
months
getting
down
to
and
back
from
manaos
or
some
smaller
city
and
usually
the
first
christening
and
the
marriage
ceremony
are
held
at
the
same
time
they
have
merely
squatter
right
to
the
land
and
are
always
in
danger
of
being
ousted
by
unscrupulous
big
men
who
come
in
late
but
with
a
title
technically
straight
the
land
laws
should
be
shaped
so
as
to
give
each
of
these
pioneer
settlers
the
land
he
actually
takes
up
and
cultivates
and
upon
which
he
makes
his
home
the
small
homemaker
who
owns
the
land
which
he
tills
with
his
own
hands
is
the
greatest
element
of
strength
in
any
country
these
are
real
pioneer
settlers
they
are
the
true
no
continent
is
ever
really
conquered
or
thoroughly
explored
by
a
few
leaders
or
exceptional
men
although
such
men
can
render
great
service
the
real
conquest
the
thorough
exploration
and
settlement
is
made
by
a
nameless
multitude
of
small
men
of
whom
the
most
important
are
of
course
the
each
treads
most
of
the
time
in
the
footsteps
of
his
predecessors
but
for
some
few
miles
at
some
time
or
other
he
breaks
new
ground
and
his
house
is
built
where
no
house
has
ever
stood
before
such
a
man
the
real
pioneer
must
have
no
strong
desire
for
social
life
and
no
need
probably
no
knowledge
of
any
luxury
or
of
any
comfort
save
of
the
most
elementary
kind
the
pioneer
who
is
always
longing
for
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
civilization
and
especially
of
great
cities
is
no
real
pioneer
at
all
these
settlers
whom
we
met
were
contented
to
live
in
the
wilderness
they
had
found
the
climate
healthy
and
the
soil
fruitful
a
visit
to
a
city
was
a
very
rare
event
nor
was
there
any
overwhelming
desire
for
it
in
short
these
men
and
those
like
them
everywhere
on
the
frontier
between
civilization
and
savagery
in
brazil
are
now
playing
the
part
played
by
our
backwoodsmen
when
over
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
they
began
the
conquest
of
the
great
basin
of
the
mississippi
the
part
played
by
the
boer
farmers
for
over
a
century
in
south
africa
and
by
the
canadians
when
less
than
half
a
century
ago
they
began
to
take
possession
of
their
northwest
every
now
and
then
some
one
says
that
the
last
frontier
is
now
to
be
found
in
canada
or
africa
and
that
it
has
almost
vanished
on
a
far
larger
scale
this
frontier
is
to
be
found
in
brazil
a
country
as
big
as
europe
or
the
united
states
and
decades
will
pass
before
it
vanishes
the
first
settlers
came
to
brazil
a
century
before
the
first
settlers
came
to
the
united
states
and
canada
for
three
hundred
years
progress
was
very
slow
portuguese
colonial
government
at
that
time
was
almost
as
bad
as
spanish
for
the
last
and
over
there
has
been
a
steady
increase
in
the
rapidity
of
the
rate
of
development
and
this
increase
bids
fair
to
be
constantly
more
rapid
in
the
future
the
paolistas
hunting
for
lands
slaves
and
mines
were
the
first
native
brazilians
who
a
hundred
years
ago
played
a
great
part
in
opening
to
settlement
vast
stretches
of
wilderness
the
rubber
hunters
have
played
a
similar
part
during
the
last
few
decades
rubber
dazzled
them
as
gold
and
diamonds
have
dazzled
other
men
and
driven
them
forth
to
wander
through
the
wide
waste
spaces
of
the
world
searching
for
rubber
they
made
highways
of
rivers
the
very
existence
of
which
was
unknown
to
the
governmental
authorities
or
to
any
whether
they
succeeded
or
failed
they
everywhere
left
behind
them
settlers
who
toiled
married
and
brought
up
children
settlement
began
the
conquest
of
the
wilderness
entered
on
its
first
stage
on
the
we
stopped
at
the
first
store
where
we
bought
of
course
at
a
high
price
sugar
and
tobacco
for
the
camaradas
in
this
land
of
plenty
the
camaradas
and
sickness
was
as
rife
among
them
as
ever
in
cherrie
boat
he
himself
and
the
steersman
were
the
only
men
who
paddled
strongly
and
continuously
the
storekeeper
stock
of
goods
was
very
low
only
what
he
still
had
left
from
that
brought
in
nearly
a
year
before
for
the
big
boats
or
had
not
yet
worked
as
far
we
expected
to
meet
them
somewhere
below
the
next
rapids
the
inferno
the
trader
or
rubberman
brings
up
his
year
supply
of
goods
in
a
batelao
starting
in
february
and
reaching
the
upper
course
of
the
river
early
in
may
when
the
rainy
season
is
over
the
parties
of
are
then
equipped
and
provisioned
and
the
settlers
purchase
certain
necessities
and
certain
things
that
strike
them
as
luxuries
this
year
the
crop
on
the
river
had
failed
a
serious
thing
for
all
explorers
and
wilderness
wanderers
on
the
we
made
the
longest
run
we
had
made
kilometres
lyra
took
observations
where
we
camped
we
were
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
at
this
the
great
beautiful
river
was
a
little
over
three
hundred
metres
wide
we
were
in
an
empty
house
the
marks
showed
that
in
the
high
water
a
couple
of
months
back
the
river
had
risen
until
the
lower
part
of
the
house
was
flooded
the
difference
between
the
level
of
the
river
during
the
floods
and
in
the
dry
season
is
extraordinary
on
the
we
made
another
good
run
getting
down
to
the
inferno
rapids
which
are
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
until
we
reached
the
cardozo
we
had
run
almost
due
north
since
then
we
had
been
running
a
little
west
of
north
before
we
reached
these
rapids
we
stopped
at
a
large
pleasant
thatch
house
and
got
a
fairly
big
and
roomy
as
well
as
light
boat
leaving
both
our
two
smaller
dugouts
behind
above
the
rapids
a
small
river
the
madeirainha
entered
from
the
left
the
rapids
had
a
fall
of
over
ten
metres
and
the
water
was
very
wild
and
rough
met
with
for
the
first
time
it
would
doubtless
have
taken
several
days
to
explore
a
passage
and
with
danger
and
labor
get
the
boats
down
but
we
were
no
longer
exploring
pioneering
over
unknown
country
it
is
easy
to
go
where
other
men
have
prepared
the
way
we
had
a
guide
we
took
our
baggage
down
by
a
carry
of
a
kilometre
long
and
the
canoes
were
run
through
known
channels
the
following
morning
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
was
a
big
house
and
store
and
camped
at
the
head
were
a
number
of
waiting
for
the
big
boats
of
the
head
rubbermen
to
work
their
way
up
from
below
they
were
a
reckless
set
of
brown
daredevils
these
men
lead
hard
lives
of
labor
and
peril
they
continually
face
death
themselves
and
they
think
little
of
it
in
connection
with
others
it
is
small
wonder
that
they
sometimes
have
difficulties
with
the
tribes
of
utterly
wild
indians
with
whom
they
are
brought
in
contact
although
there
is
a
strong
indian
strain
in
their
own
blood
the
following
morning
after
the
empty
canoes
had
been
run
down
we
started
and
made
a
rather
short
afternoon
journey
we
had
to
take
the
baggage
by
one
rapids
we
camped
in
an
empty
house
in
the
rain
next
day
we
ran
nearly
fifty
kilometres
the
river
making
a
long
sweep
to
the
west
we
met
half
a
dozen
batelaos
making
their
way
each
with
a
crew
of
six
or
eight
men
and
two
of
them
with
women
and
children
in
addition
the
crew
were
using
very
long
poles
with
crooks
or
rather
the
stubs
of
cut
branches
which
served
as
crooks
at
the
upper
end
with
these
they
hooked
into
the
branches
and
dragged
themselves
up
along
the
bank
in
addition
to
poling
where
the
depth
permitted
it
the
river
was
as
big
as
the
paraguay
at
corumba
but
in
striking
contrast
to
the
paraguay
there
were
few
we
ran
some
rather
stiff
rapids
the
infernino
without
unloading
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
we
landed
for
the
night
at
a
large
open
house
where
there
were
two
or
three
pigs
the
first
live
stock
we
had
seen
other
than
poultry
and
ducks
it
was
a
dirty
place
but
we
got
some
eggs
the
following
day
the
we
ran
down
some
fifty
kilometres
to
the
carupanan
rapids
which
by
observation
lyra
found
to
be
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
we
met
several
batelaos
and
the
houses
on
the
bank
showed
that
the
settlers
were
somewhat
better
off
than
was
the
case
farther
up
at
the
rapids
was
a
big
store
the
property
of
senhor
caripe
the
wealthiest
rubberman
who
works
on
this
river
many
of
the
men
we
met
were
in
his
employ
he
has
himself
risen
from
the
ranks
he
was
most
kind
and
hospitable
and
gave
us
another
boat
to
replace
the
last
of
our
dugouts
the
large
open
house
was
cool
clean
and
comfortable
with
these
began
a
series
of
half
a
dozen
sets
of
rapids
all
coming
within
the
next
dozen
kilometres
and
all
offering
very
real
obstacles
at
one
we
saw
the
graves
of
four
men
who
had
perished
therein
and
many
more
had
died
whose
bodies
were
never
recovered
the
toll
of
human
life
had
been
heavy
had
we
been
still
on
an
unknown
river
pioneering
our
own
way
it
would
doubtless
have
taken
us
at
least
a
fortnight
of
labor
and
peril
to
pass
but
it
actually
took
only
a
day
and
a
half
all
the
channels
were
known
all
the
trails
cut
senhor
caripe
a
waterman
cool
fearless
and
brawny
as
a
bull
came
with
us
as
guide
half
a
dozen
times
the
loads
were
taken
out
and
carried
down
at
one
cataract
the
canoes
were
themselves
dragged
overland
elsewhere
they
were
run
down
empty
shipping
a
good
deal
of
water
at
the
foot
of
the
cataract
where
we
dragged
the
canoes
overland
we
camped
for
the
night
here
kermit
shot
a
big
cayman
our
camp
was
alongside
the
graves
of
three
men
who
at
this
point
had
perished
in
the
swift
water
senhor
caripe
told
us
many
strange
adventures
of
he
had
met
or
employed
one
of
his
men
working
on
the
got
lost
and
after
days
found
himself
on
the
madeirainha
which
he
thus
discovered
he
was
in
excellent
health
for
he
had
means
to
start
a
fire
and
he
found
abundance
of
and
big
senhor
caripe
said
that
the
rubbermen
now
did
not
go
above
the
ninth
degree
or
thereabouts
on
the
upper
aripuanan
proper
having
found
the
rubber
poor
on
the
reaches
above
a
year
previously
five
rubbermen
mundurucu
indians
were
working
on
the
corumba
at
about
that
level
it
is
a
difficult
stream
to
ascend
or
descend
they
made
excursions
into
the
forest
for
days
at
a
time
after
caoutchouc
on
one
such
trip
after
fifteen
days
they
to
their
surprise
came
out
on
the
aripuanan
they
returned
and
told
their
patron
of
their
discovery
and
by
his
orders
took
their
caoutchouc
overland
to
the
aripuanan
built
a
canoe
and
ran
down
with
their
caoutchouc
to
manaos
they
had
now
returned
and
were
working
on
the
upper
aripuanan
the
mundurucus
and
brazilians
are
always
on
the
best
terms
and
the
former
are
even
more
inveterate
enemies
of
the
wild
indians
than
are
the
latter
by
on
april
we
had
passed
the
last
dangerous
rapids
the
paddles
were
plied
with
hearty
good
will
cherrie
and
kermit
as
usual
working
like
the
camaradas
and
the
canoes
went
dancing
down
the
broad
rapid
river
the
equatorial
forest
crowded
on
either
hand
to
the
water
edge
and
although
the
river
was
falling
it
was
still
so
high
that
in
many
places
little
islands
were
completely
submerged
and
the
current
raced
among
the
trunks
of
the
green
trees
at
one
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
castanho
proper
and
in
sight
of
the
tent
of
lieutenant
pyrineus
with
the
flags
of
the
united
states
and
brazil
flying
before
it
and
with
rifles
firing
from
the
canoes
and
the
shore
we
moored
at
the
landing
of
the
neat
soldierly
well
kept
camp
the
upper
aripuanan
a
river
of
substantially
the
same
volume
as
the
castanho
but
broader
at
this
point
and
probably
of
less
length
here
joined
the
castanho
from
the
east
and
the
two
together
formed
what
the
rubbermen
called
the
lower
aripuanan
the
mouth
of
this
was
indicated
and
sometimes
named
on
the
maps
but
only
as
a
small
and
unimportant
stream
we
had
been
two
months
in
the
canoes
from
the
of
february
to
the
of
april
we
had
gone
over
kilometres
the
river
from
its
source
near
the
thirteenth
degree
to
where
it
became
navigable
and
we
entered
it
had
a
course
of
some
kilometres
probably
more
perhaps
kilometres
therefore
we
had
now
put
on
the
map
a
river
nearly
kilometres
in
length
of
which
the
existence
was
not
merely
unknown
but
impossible
if
the
standard
maps
were
correct
but
this
was
not
all
it
seemed
that
this
river
of
kilometres
in
length
was
really
the
true
upper
course
of
the
aripuanan
proper
in
which
case
the
total
length
was
nearly
kilometres
pyrineus
had
been
waiting
for
us
over
a
month
at
the
junction
of
what
the
rubbermen
called
the
castanho
and
of
what
they
called
the
upper
aripuanan
he
had
no
idea
as
to
which
stream
we
would
appear
upon
or
whether
we
would
appear
upon
either
on
march
he
had
measured
the
volume
of
the
two
and
found
that
the
castanho
although
the
narrower
was
the
deeper
and
swifter
and
that
in
volume
it
surpassed
the
other
by
cubic
metres
a
second
since
then
the
castanho
had
fallen
our
measurements
showed
it
to
be
slightly
smaller
than
the
other
the
volume
of
the
river
after
the
junction
was
about
cubic
metres
a
second
this
was
in
degrees
minutes
we
were
glad
indeed
to
see
pyrineus
and
be
at
his
attractive
camp
we
were
only
four
hours
above
the
little
river
hamlet
of
sao
joao
a
port
of
call
for
from
which
the
larger
ones
go
to
manaos
in
two
days
these
steamers
mostly
belong
to
senhor
caripe
from
pyrineus
we
learned
that
lauriado
and
fiala
had
reached
manaos
on
march
on
the
swift
water
in
the
gorge
of
the
papagaio
fiala
boat
had
been
upset
and
all
his
belongings
lost
while
he
himself
had
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
i
was
glad
indeed
that
the
fine
and
gallant
fellow
had
escaped
the
canadian
canoe
had
done
very
well
we
were
no
less
rejoiced
to
learn
that
amilcar
the
head
of
the
party
that
went
down
the
was
also
all
right
although
his
canoe
too
had
been
upset
in
the
rapids
and
his
instruments
and
all
his
notes
lost
he
had
reached
manaos
on
april
fiala
had
gone
home
miller
was
collecting
near
manaos
he
had
been
doing
capital
work
the
piranhas
were
bad
here
and
no
one
could
bathe
cherrie
while
standing
in
the
water
close
to
the
shore
was
attacked
and
bitten
but
with
one
bound
he
was
on
the
bank
before
any
damage
could
be
done
we
spent
a
last
night
under
canvas
at
pyrineus
encampment
it
rained
heavily
next
morning
we
all
gathered
at
the
monument
which
colonel
rondon
had
erected
and
he
read
the
orders
of
the
day
these
recited
just
what
had
been
accomplished
set
forth
the
fact
that
we
had
now
by
actual
exploration
and
investigation
discovered
that
the
river
whose
upper
portion
had
been
called
the
duvida
on
the
maps
of
the
telegraphic
commission
and
the
unknown
major
part
of
which
we
had
just
traversed
and
the
river
known
to
a
few
rubbermen
but
to
no
one
else
as
the
castanho
and
the
lower
part
of
the
river
known
to
the
rubbermen
as
the
aripuanan
which
did
not
appear
on
the
maps
save
as
its
mouth
was
sometimes
indicated
with
no
hint
of
its
size
were
all
parts
of
one
and
the
same
river
and
that
by
order
of
the
brazilian
government
this
river
the
largest
affluent
of
the
madeira
with
its
source
near
the
degree
and
its
mouth
a
little
south
of
the
degree
hitherto
utterly
unknown
to
cartographers
and
in
large
part
utterly
unknown
to
any
save
the
local
tribes
of
indians
had
been
named
the
rio
roosevelt
we
left
rondon
lyra
and
pyrineus
to
take
observations
and
the
rest
of
us
embarked
for
the
last
time
on
the
canoes
and
borne
swiftly
on
the
rapid
current
we
passed
over
one
set
of
not
very
important
rapids
and
ran
down
to
senhor
caripe
little
hamlet
of
sao
joao
which
we
reached
about
one
on
april
just
before
a
heavy
afternoon
rain
set
in
we
had
run
nearly
eight
hundred
kilometres
during
the
sixty
days
we
had
spent
in
the
canoes
here
we
found
and
boarded
pyrineus
river
steamer
which
seemed
in
our
eyes
extremely
comfortable
in
the
senhor
pleasant
house
we
were
greeted
by
the
senhora
and
they
were
both
more
than
thoughtful
and
generous
in
their
hospitality
ahead
of
us
lay
merely
hours
by
steamer
to
manaos
such
a
trip
as
that
we
had
taken
tries
men
as
if
by
fire
cherrie
had
more
than
stood
every
test
and
in
him
kermit
and
i
had
come
to
recognize
a
friend
with
whom
our
friendship
would
never
falter
or
grow
less
early
the
following
afternoon
our
whole
party
together
with
senhor
caripe
started
on
the
steamer
it
took
us
a
little
over
twelve
swift
steaming
to
run
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
the
upper
course
of
which
our
progress
had
been
so
slow
and
painful
from
source
to
mouth
according
to
our
itinerary
and
to
lyra
calculations
the
course
of
the
stream
down
which
we
had
thus
come
was
about
kilometres
in
length
about
miles
perhaps
nearly
miles
from
its
source
near
the
degree
in
the
highlands
to
its
mouth
in
the
madeira
near
the
degree
next
morning
we
were
on
the
broad
sluggish
current
of
the
lower
madeira
a
beautiful
tropical
river
there
were
heavy
rainstorms
as
usual
although
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
very
end
of
the
rainy
season
in
the
afternoon
we
finally
entered
the
wonderful
amazon
itself
the
mighty
river
which
contains
one
tenth
of
all
the
running
water
of
the
globe
it
was
miles
across
where
we
entered
it
and
indeed
we
could
not
tell
whether
the
farther
bank
which
we
saw
was
that
of
the
mainland
or
an
island
we
went
up
it
until
about
midnight
then
steamed
up
the
rio
negro
for
a
short
distance
and
at
one
in
the
morning
of
april
reached
manaos
manaos
is
a
remarkable
city
it
is
only
three
degrees
south
of
the
equator
sixty
years
ago
it
was
a
nameless
little
collection
of
hovels
tenanted
by
a
few
indians
and
a
few
of
the
poorest
class
of
brazilian
peasants
now
it
is
a
big
handsome
modern
city
with
opera
house
tramways
good
hotels
fine
squares
and
public
buildings
and
attractive
private
houses
the
brilliant
coloring
and
odd
architecture
give
the
place
a
very
foreign
and
attractive
flavor
in
northern
eyes
its
rapid
growth
to
prosperity
was
due
to
the
rubber
trade
this
is
now
far
less
remunerative
than
formerly
it
will
undoubtedly
in
some
degree
recover
and
in
any
event
the
development
of
the
immensely
rich
and
fertile
amazonian
valley
is
sure
to
go
on
and
it
will
be
immensely
quickened
when
closer
connections
are
made
with
the
brazilian
highland
country
lying
south
of
it
here
we
found
miller
and
glad
indeed
we
were
to
see
him
he
had
made
good
collections
of
mammals
and
birds
on
the
the
madeira
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
manaos
his
entire
collection
of
mammals
was
really
noteworthy
among
them
was
the
only
sloth
any
of
us
had
seen
on
the
trip
the
most
interesting
of
the
birds
he
had
seen
was
the
hoatzin
this
is
a
most
curious
bird
of
very
archaic
type
its
flight
is
feeble
and
the
naked
young
have
spurs
on
their
wings
by
the
help
of
which
they
crawl
actively
among
the
branches
before
their
feathers
grow
they
swim
no
less
easily
at
the
same
early
age
miller
got
one
or
two
nests
and
preserved
specimens
of
the
surroundings
of
the
nests
and
he
made
exhaustive
records
of
the
habits
of
the
birds
near
megasso
a
jaguar
had
killed
one
of
the
bullocks
that
were
being
driven
along
for
food
the
big
cat
had
not
seized
the
ox
with
its
claws
by
the
head
but
had
torn
open
its
throat
and
neck
every
one
was
most
courteous
at
manaos
especially
the
governor
of
the
state
and
the
mayor
of
the
city
robiliard
the
british
consular
representative
and
also
the
representative
of
the
booth
line
of
steamers
was
particularly
kind
he
secured
for
us
passages
on
one
of
the
cargo
boats
of
the
line
to
para
and
thence
on
one
of
the
regular
steamers
to
barbados
and
new
york
the
booth
people
were
most
courteous
to
us
i
said
to
the
camaradas
with
real
friendship
and
regret
the
parting
gift
i
gave
to
each
was
in
gold
sovereigns
and
i
was
rather
touched
to
learn
later
that
they
had
agreed
among
themselves
each
to
keep
one
sovereign
as
a
medal
of
honor
and
token
that
the
owner
had
been
on
the
trip
they
were
a
fine
set
brave
patient
obedient
and
enduring
now
they
had
forgotten
their
hard
times
they
were
fat
from
eating
at
leisure
all
they
wished
they
were
to
see
rio
janeiro
always
an
object
of
ambition
with
men
of
their
stamp
and
they
were
very
proud
of
their
membership
in
the
expedition
later
at
belen
i
said
to
colonel
rondon
doctor
cajazeira
and
lieutenant
lyra
together
with
my
admiration
for
their
hardihood
courage
and
resolution
i
had
grown
to
feel
a
strong
and
affectionate
friendship
for
them
i
had
become
very
fond
of
them
and
i
was
glad
to
feel
that
i
had
been
their
companion
in
the
performance
of
a
feat
which
possessed
a
certain
lasting
importance
on
may
we
left
manaos
for
as
until
recently
it
was
called
the
trip
was
interesting
we
steamed
down
through
tempest
and
sunshine
and
the
towering
forest
was
dwarfed
by
the
giant
river
it
fringed
sunrise
and
sunset
turned
the
sky
to
an
unearthly
flame
of
many
colors
above
the
vast
water
it
all
seemed
the
embodiment
of
loneliness
and
wild
majesty
yet
everywhere
man
was
conquering
the
loneliness
and
wresting
the
majesty
to
his
own
uses
we
passed
many
thriving
growing
towns
at
one
we
stopped
to
take
on
cargo
everywhere
there
was
growth
and
development
the
change
since
the
days
when
bates
and
wallace
came
to
this
then
poor
and
utterly
primitive
region
is
marvellous
one
of
its
accompaniments
has
been
a
large
european
chiefly
south
european
immigration
the
blood
is
everywhere
mixed
there
is
no
color
line
as
in
most
countries
and
the
negro
and
indian
strains
are
very
strong
but
the
dominant
blood
the
blood
already
dominant
in
quantity
and
that
is
steadily
increasing
its
dominance
is
the
only
rarely
did
the
river
show
its
full
width
generally
we
were
in
channels
or
among
islands
the
surface
of
the
water
was
dotted
with
little
islands
of
floating
vegetation
miller
said
that
much
of
this
came
from
the
lagoons
such
as
those
where
he
had
been
hunting
beside
the
solimoens
lagoons
filled
with
the
huge
and
splendid
victoria
lily
and
with
masses
of
water
hyacinths
miller
who
was
very
fond
of
animals
and
always
took
much
care
of
them
had
a
small
collection
which
he
was
bringing
back
for
the
bronx
zoo
an
agouti
was
so
tempered
that
he
had
to
be
kept
solitary
but
three
monkeys
big
and
little
and
a
young
peccary
formed
a
happy
family
the
largest
monkey
cried
shedding
real
tears
when
taken
in
the
arms
and
pitied
the
monkey
was
stupid
and
kindly
and
all
the
rest
of
the
company
imposed
on
it
the
little
monkey
invariably
rode
on
its
back
and
the
peccary
used
it
as
a
head
pillow
when
it
felt
sleepy
belen
the
capital
of
the
state
of
para
was
an
admirable
illustration
of
the
genuine
and
almost
startling
progress
which
brazil
has
been
making
of
recent
years
it
is
a
beautiful
city
nearly
under
the
equator
but
it
is
not
merely
beautiful
the
docks
the
dredging
operations
the
warehouses
the
stores
and
shops
all
tell
of
energy
and
success
in
commercial
life
it
is
as
clean
healthy
and
well
policed
a
city
as
any
of
the
size
in
the
north
temperate
zone
the
public
buildings
are
handsome
the
private
dwellings
attractive

and
an

who
has
gone

most
wisely
she
has
confined

and
in
consequence
i
know
of
no
better
local
zoological

she
has
an
invaluable
collection
of
birds
and
mammals
of
the
region
and
it
was
a
privilege
to
meet
her
and
talk
with
her
we
also
met
professor
farrabee
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
the
ethnologist
he
had
just
finished
a
very
difficult
and
important
trip
from
manaos
by
the
rio
branco
to
the
highlands
of
guiana
across
them
on
foot
and
down
to
the
seacoast
of
british
guiana
he
is
an
admirable
representative
of
the
men
who
are
now
opening
south
america
to
scientific
knowledge
on
may
we
bade
to
our
kind
brazilian
friends
and
sailed
northward
for
barbados
and
new
york
zoologically
the
trip
had
been
a
thorough
success
cherrie
and
miller
had
collected
over
hundred
birds
about
five
hundred
mammals
and
a
few
reptiles
batrachians
and
fishes
many
of
them
were
new
to
science
for
much
of
the
region
traversed
had
never
previously
been
worked
by
any
scientific
collector
of
course
the
most
important
work
we
did
was
the
geographic
work
the
exploration
of
the
unknown
river
undertaken
at
the
suggestion
of
the
brazilian
government
and
in
conjunction
with
its
representatives
no
piece
of
work
of
this
kind
is
ever
achieved
save
as
it
is
based
on
long
continued
previous
work
as
i
have
before
said
what
we
did
was
to
put
the
cap
on
the
pyramid
that
had
been
built
by
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
of
the
telegraphic
commission
during
the
six
previous
years
it
was
their
scientific
exploration
of
the
chapadao
their
mapping
the
basin
of
the
juruena
and
their
descent
of
the
parana
that
rendered
it
possible
for
us
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
river
of
doubt
the
work
of
the
commission
much
the
greatest
work
of
the
kind
ever
done
in
south
america
is
one
of
the
many
many
achievements
which
the
republican
government
of
brazil
has
to
its
credit
brazil
has
been
blessed
beyond
the
average
of
her
sisters
because
she
won
her
way
to
republicanism
by
evolution
rather
than
revolution
they
plunged
into
the
extremely
difficult
experiment
of
democratic
of
popular
after
enduring
the
atrophy
of
every
quality
of
and
initiative
throughout
three
withering
centuries
of
existence
under
the
worst
and
most
foolish
form
of
colonial
government
both
from
the
civil
and
the
religious
standpoint
that
has
ever
existed
the
marvel
is
not
that
some
of
them
failed
but
that
some
of
them
have
eventually
succeeded
in
such
striking
fashion
brazil
on
the
contrary
when
she
achieved
independence
first
exercised
it
under
the
form
of
an
authoritative
empire
then
under
the
form
of
a
liberal
empire
when
the
republic
came
the
people
were
reasonably
ripe
for
it
the
great
progress
of
brazil
and
it
has
been
an
astonishing
progress
has
been
made
under
the
republic
i
could
give
innumerable
examples
and
illustrations
of
this
the
change
that
has
converted
rio
janeiro
from
a
picturesque
into
a
singularly
beautiful
healthy
clean
and
efficient
modern
great
city
is
one
of
these
another
is
the
work
of
the
telegraphic
commission
we
put
upon
the
map
a
river
some
fifteen
hundred
kilometres
in
length
of
which
the
upper
course
was
not
merely
utterly
unknown
to
but
unguessed
at
by
anybody
while
the
lower
course
although
known
for
years
to
a
few
rubbermen
was
utterly
unknown
to
cartographers
it
is
the
chief
affluent
of
the
madeira
which
is
itself
the
chief
affluent
of
the
amazon
the
source
of
this
river
is
between
the

parallels
of

south
and
the

we
embarked
on
it
at
about

about

after
that
its
entire
course
lay
between
the

approaching
the
latter
most
closely
about

the
first
rapids
we
encountered
were
in

in
uninterrupted

they
continued
for
about

appendix
a
the
work
of
the
field
zoologist
and
field
geographer
in
south
america
portions
of
south
america
are
now
entering
on
a
career
of
great
social
and
industrial
development
much
remains
to
be
known
so
far
as
the
outside
world
is
concerned
of
the
social
and
industrial
condition
in
the
interior
regions
more
remains
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
pioneer
exploring
and
of
scientific
work
in
the
great
stretches
of
virgin
wilderness
the
only
two
other
continents
where
such
work
of
like
volume
and
value
remains
to
be
done
are
africa
and
asia
and
neither
africa
nor
asia
offers
a
more
inviting
field
for
the
best
kind
of
field
worker
in
geographical
exploration
and
in
zoological
geological
and
paleontological
investigation
the
explorer
is
merely
the
most
adventurous
kind
of
field
geographer
and
there
are
two
or
three
points
worth
keeping
in
mind
in
dealing
with
the
south
american
work
of
the
field
geographer
and
field
zoologist
roughly
the
travellers
who
now
visit
like
those
who
for
the
past
century
have
visited
south
america
come
in
three
categories
although
of
course
these
categories
are
not
divided
by
lines
first
there
are
the
travellers
who
skirt
the
continent
in
comfortable
steamers
going
from
one
great
seaport
to
another
and
occasionally
taking
a
short
railway
journey
to
some
big
interior
city
not
too
far
from
the
coast
this
is
a
trip
well
worth
taking
by
all
intelligent
men
and
women
who
can
afford
it
and
it
is
being
taken
by
such
men
and
women
with
increasing
frequency
it
entails
no
more
difficulty
than
a
similar
trip
to
the
mediterranean
than
such
a
trip
which
to
a
learned
and
observer
offers
the
same
chance
for
acquiring
knowledge
and
if
he
is
himself
gifted
with
wisdom
the
same
chance
of
imparting
his
knowledge
to
others
that
is
offered
by
a
trip
of
similar
length
through
the
larger
cities
of
europe
or
the
united
states
probably
the
best
instance
of
the
excellent
use
to
which
such
an
observer
can
put
his
experience
is
afforded
by
the
volume
of
bryce
of
course
such
a
trip
represents
travelling
of
essentially
the
same
kind
as
travelling
by
railroad
from
atlanta
to
calgary
or
from
madrid
to
moscow
next
there
are
the
travellers
who
visit
the
districts
and
colonial
cities
of
the
interior
travelling
over
land
or
river
highways
which
have
been
traversed
for
centuries
but
which
are
still
primitive
as
regards
the
inns
and
the
modes
of
conveyance
such
travelling
is
difficult
in
the
sense
that
travelling
in
parts
of
spain
or
southern
italy
or
the
balkan
states
is
difficult
men
and
women
who
have
a
taste
for
travel
in
places
and
who
therefore
do
not
mind
slight
discomforts
and
inconveniences
have
the
chance
themselves
to
enjoy
and
to
make
others
profit
by
travels
of
this
kind
in
south
america
in
economic
social
and
political
matters
the
studies
and
observations
of
these
travellers
are
essential
in
order
to
supplement
and
sometimes
to
correct
those
of
travellers
of
the
first
category
for
it
is
not
safe
to
generalize
overmuch
about
any
country
merely
from
a
visit
to
its
capital
or
its
chief
seaport
these
travellers
of
the
second
category
can
give
us
most
interesting
and
valuable
information
about
quaint
little
belated
cities
about
backward
country
folk
kindly
or
the
reverse
who
show
a
mixture
of
the
ideas
of
savagery
with
the
ideas
of
an
ancient
peasantry
and
about
rough
old
highways
of
travel
which
in
comfort
do
not
differ
much
from
those
of
mediaeval
europe
the
travellers
who
go
up
or
down
the
highway
rivers
that
have
been
travelled
for
from
one
to
four
hundred
years
rivers
like
the
paraguay
and
parana
the
amazon
the
tapajos
the
madeira
the
lower
orinoco
come
in
this
category
they
can
add
little
to
our
geographical
knowledge
but
if
they
are
competent
zoologists
or
archaeologists
especially
if
they
live
or
sojourn
long
in
a
locality
their
work
may
be
invaluable
from
the
scientific
standpoint
the
work
of
the
archaeologists
among
the
immeasurably
ancient
ruins
of
the
forests
and
the
andean
plateaux
is
of
this
kind
what
agassiz
did
for
the
fishes
of
the
amazon
and
what
hudson
did
for
the
birds
of
the
argentine
are
other
instances
of
the
work
that
can
thus
be
done
burton
writings
on
the
interior
of
brazil
offer
an
excellent
instance
of
the
value
of
a
sojourn
or
trip
of
this
type
even
without
any
especial
scientific
object
of
course
travellers
of
this
kind
need
to
remember
that
their
experiences
in
themselves
do
not
qualify
them
to
speak
as
wilderness
explorers
exactly
as
a
good
archaeologist
may
not
be
competent
to
speak
of
current
social
or
political
problems
so
a
man
who
has
done
capital
work
as
a
tourist
observer
in
cities
and
along
remote
highways
must
beware
of
regarding
himself
as
being
thereby
rendered
fit
for
genuine
wilderness
work
or
competent
to
pass
judgment
on
the
men
who
do
such
work
to
cross
the
andes
on
along
the
regular
routes
is
a
feat
comparable
to
the
feats
of
the
energetic
tourists
who
by
thousands
traverse
the
mule
trails
in
nooks
of
switzerland
an
ordinary
trip
on
the
highway
portions
of
the
amazon
paraguay
or
orinoco
in
itself
no
more
qualifies
a
man
to
speak
of
or
to
take
part
in
exploring
unknown
south
american
rivers
than
a
trip
on
the
lower
saint
lawrence
qualifies
a
man
to
regard
himself
as
an
expert
in
a
canoe
voyage
across
labrador
or
the
barren
grounds
west
of
hudson
bay
a
hundred
years
ago
even
seventy
or
eighty
years
ago
before
the
age
of
steamboats
and
railroads
it
was
more
difficult
than
at
present
to
define
the
limits
between
this
class
and
the
next
and
moreover
in
defining
these
limits
i
emphatically
disclaim
any
intention
of
thereby
attempting
to
establish
a
single
standard
of
value
for
books
of
travel
darwin
voyage
of
the
beagle
is
to
me
the
best
book
of
the
kind
ever
written
it
is
one
of
those
classics
which
decline
to
go
into
artificial
categories
and
which
stand
by
themselves
and
yet
darwin
with
his
usual
modesty
spoke
of
it
as
in
effect
a
yachting
voyage
humboldt
work
had
a
profound
effect
on
the
thought
of
the
civilized
world
his
trip
was
one
of
adventure
and
danger
and
yet
it
can
hardly
be
called
exploration
proper
he
visited
places
which
had
been
settled
and
inhabited
for
centuries
and
traversed
places
which
had
been
travelled
by
civilized
men
for
years
before
he
followed
in
their
footsteps
but
these
places
were
in
spanish
colonies
and
access
to
them
had
been
forbidden
by
the
mischievous
and
intolerant
tyranny
ecclesiastical
political
and
economic
which
then
rendered
spain
the
most
backward
of
european
nations
and
humboldt
was
the
first
scientific
man
of
intellectual
independence
who
had
permission
to
visit
them
to
this
day
many
of
his
scientific
observations
are
of
real
value
bates
came
to
the
amazon
just
before
the
era
of
amazonian
steamboats
he
never
went
off
the
native
routes
of
ordinary
travel
but
he
was
a
devoted
and
able
naturalist
he
lived
an
exceedingly
isolated
primitive
and
laborious
life
for
eleven
years
now
half
a
century
after
it
was
written
his
naturalist
on
the
amazon
is
as
interesting
and
valuable
as
it
ever
was
and
no
book
since
written
has
in
any
way
supplanted
it
travel
of
the
third
category
includes
the
work
of
the
true
wilderness
explorers
who
add
to
our
sum
of
geographical
knowledge
and
of
the
scientific
men
who
following
their
several
bents
also
work
in
the
untrodden
wilds
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
have
done
much
in
the
geographical
exploration
of
unknown
country
and
cherrie
and
miller
have
penetrated
and
lived
for
months
and
years
in
the
wastes
on
their
own
resources
as
incidents
to
their
mammalogical
and
ornithological
work
professor
farrabee
the
anthropologist
is
a
capital
example
of
the
man
who
does
this
hard
and
valuable
type
of
work
an
immense
amount
of
this
true
wilderness
work
geographical
and
zoological
remains
to
be
done
in
south
america
it
can
be
accomplished
with
reasonable
thoroughness
only
by
the
efforts
of
very
many
different
workers
each
in
his
own
special
field
it
is
desirable
that
here
and
there
a
part
of
the
work
should
be
done
in
outline
by
such
a
geographic
and
zoological
reconnaissance
as
ours
we
would
for
example
be
very
grateful
for
such
work
in
portions
of
the
interior
of
the
guianas
on
the
headwaters
of
the
xingu
and
here
and
there
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
andes
but
as
a
rule
the
work
must
be
specialized
and
in
its
final
shape
it
must
be
specialized
everywhere
the
first
geographical
explorers
of
the
untrodden
wilderness
the
first
wanderers
who
penetrate
the
wastes
where
they
are
confronted
with
starvation
disease
and
danger
and
death
in
every
from
can
not
take
with
them
the
elaborate
equipment
necessary
in
order
to
do
the
thorough
scientific
work
demanded
by
modern
scientific
requirements
this
is
true
even
of
exploration
done
along
the
courses
of
unknown
rivers
it
is
more
true
of
the
exploration
which
must
in
south
america
become
increasingly
necessary
done
across
country
away
from
the
rivers
the
scientific
work
proper
of
these
early
explorers
must
be
of
a
somewhat
preliminary
nature
in
other
words
the
most
difficult
and
therefore
ordinarily
the
most
important
pieces
of
exploration
are
precisely
those
where
the
scientific
work
of
the
accompanying
cartographer
geologist
botanist
and
zoologist
must
be
furthest
removed
from
finality
the
zoologist
who
works
to
most
advantage
in
the
wilderness
must
take
his
time
and
therefore
he
must
normally
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
and
not
accompany
the
first
explorers
the
man
who
wishes
to
do
the
best
scientific
work
in
the
wilderness
must
not
try
to
combine
incompatible
types
of
work
nor
to
cover
too
much
ground
in
too
short
a
time
there
is
no
better
example
of
the
kind
of
zoologist
who
does
class
in
the
wilderness
than
john
haseman
who
spent
from
to
in
painstaking
and
thorough
scientific
investigation
over
a
large
extent
of
south
american
territory
hitherto
only
partially
known
or
quite
unexplored
haseman
primary
object
was
to
study
the
characteristics
and
distribution
of
south
american
fishes
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
studied
at
first
hand
many
other
more
or
less
kindred
subjects
as
may
be
seen
in
his
remarks
on
the
indians
and
in
his
excellent
pamphlet
on
some
factors
of
geographical
distribution
in
south
america
haseman
made
his
long
journey
with
a
very
slender
equipment
his
extraordinarily
successful
being
due
to
his
bodily
health
and
vigor
and
his
resourcefulness
and
resolution
his
writings
are
rendered
valuable
by
his
accuracy
and
common
sense
the
need
of
the
former
of
these
two
attributes
will
be
appreciated
by
whoever
has
studied
the
really
scandalous
fictions
which
have
been
published
as
genuine
by
some
modern
explorers
and
adventurers
in
south
america
and
the
need
of
the
latter
by
whoever
has
studied
some
of
the
wild
theories
propounded
in
the
name
of
science
concerning
the
history
of
life
on
the
south
american
continent
there
is
however
one
serious
criticism
to
be
made
on
haseman
the
extreme
obscurity
of
his
style
an
obscurity
mixed
with
occasional
bits
of
scientific
pedantry
which
makes
it
difficult
to
tell
whether
or
not
on
some
points
his
thought
is
obscure
also
modern
scientists
like
modern
historians
and
above
all
scientific
and
historical
educators
should
ever
keep
in
mind
that
clearness
of
speech
and
writing
is
essential
to
clearness
of
thought
and
that
a
simple
clear
and
if
possible
vivid
style
is
vital
to
the
production
of
the
best
work
in
either
science
or
history
darwin
and
huxley
are
classics
and
they
would
not
have
been
if
they
had
not
written
good
english
the
thought
is
essential
but
ability
to
give
it
clear
expression
is
only
less
essential
ability
to
write
well
if
the
writer
has
nothing
to
write
about
entitles
him
to
mere
derision
but
the
greatest
thought
is
robbed
of
an
immense
proportion
of
its
value
if
expressed
in
a
mean
or
obscure
manner
haseman
has
such
excellent
thought
that
it
is
a
pity
to
make
it
a
work
of
irritating
labor
to
find
out
just
what
the
thought
is
surely
if
he
will
take
as
much
pains
with
his
writing
as
he
has
with
the
far
more
difficult
business
of
exploring
and
collecting
he
will
become
able
to
express
his
thought
clearly
and
forcefully
at
least
he
can
if
he
chooses
go
over
his
sentences
until
he
is
reasonably
sure
that
they
can
be
parsed
he
can
take
pains
to
see
that
his
whole
thought
is
expressed
instead
of
leaving
vacancies
which
must
be
filled
by
the
puzzled
and
groping
reader
his
own
views
and
his
quotations
from
the
views
of
others
about
the
static
and
dynamic
theories
of
distribution
are
examples
of
an
important
principle
so
imperfectly
expressed
as
to
make
us
doubtful
whether
it
is
perfectly
apprehended
by
the
writer
he
can
avoid
the
use
of
those
pedantic
terms
which
are
really
nothing
but
offensive
and
fortunately
ephemeral
scientific
slang
there
has
been
for
instance
a
recent
vogue
for
the
extensive
misuse
usually
tautological
misuse
of
the
word
complexus
an
excellent
word
if
used
rarely
and
for
definite
purposes
haseman
drags
it
in
continually
when
its
use
is
either
pointless
and
redundant
or
else
serves
purely
to
darken
wisdom
he
speaks
of
the
antillean
complex
when
he
means
the
antilles
of
the
organic
complex
instead
of
the
characteristic
or
bodily
characteristics
of
an
animal
or
species
and
of
the
environmental
complex
when
he
means
nothing
whatever
but
the
environment
in
short
haseman
and
those
whose
bad
example
he
in
this
instance
follows
use
complexus
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
that
displayed
by
the
famous
old
lady
who
derived
religious
instead
of
scientific
consolation
from
the
use
of
the
blessed
word
mesopotamia
the
reason
that
it
is
worth
while
to
enter
this
protest
against
haseman
style
is
because
his
work
is
of
such
real
and
marked
value
the
pamphlet
on
the
distribution
of
south
american
species
shows
that
to
exceptional
ability
as
a
field
worker
he
adds
a
rare
power
to
draw
with
both
caution
and
originality
the
necessary
general
conclusions
from
the
results
of
his
own
observations
and
from
the
recorded
studies
of
other
men
and
there
is
nothing
more
needed
at
the
present
moment
among
our
scientific
men
than
the
development
of
a
school
of
men
who
while
industrious
and
minute
observers
and
collectors
and
cautious
generalizers
yet
do
not
permit
the
faculty
of
wise
generalization
to
be
atrophied
by
excessive
devotion
to
labyrinthine
detail
haseman
upholds
with
strong
reasoning
the
theory
that
since
the
appearance
of
all
but
the
lowest
forms
of
life
on
this
globe
there
have
always
been
three
great
continental
masses
sometimes
solid
sometimes
broken
extending
southward
from
the
northern
hemisphere
and
from
time
to
time
connected
in
the
north
but
not
in
the
middle
regions
or
the
south
since
the
carboniferous
epoch
he
holds
that
life
has
been
intermittently
distributed
southward
along
these
continental
masses
when
there
were
no
breaks
in
their
southward
connection
and
intermittently
exchanged
between
them
when
they
were
connected
in
the
north
and
he
also
upholds
the
view
that
from
a
common
ancestral
form
the
same
species
has
been
often
developed
in
entirely
disconnected
localities
when
in
these
localities
the
conditions
of
environment
were
the
same
the
opposite
view
is
that
there
have
been
frequent
connections
between
the
great
land
masses
alike
in
the
tropics
in
the
south
temperate
zone
and
in
the
antarctic
region
the
upholders
of
this
theory
base
it
almost
exclusively
on
the
distribution
of
living
and
fossil
forms
of
life
that
is
it
is
based
almost
exclusively
on
biological
and
not
geological
considerations
unquestionably
the
distribution
of
many
forms
of
life
past
and
present
offers
problems
which
with
our
present
paleontological
knowledge
we
are
wholly
unable
to
solve
if
we
consider
only
the
biological
facts
concerning
some
one
group
of
animals
it
is
not
only
easy
but
inevitable
to
conclude
that
its
distribution
must
be
accounted
for
by
the
existence
of
some
former
direct
land
bridge
extending
for
instance
between
patagonia
and
australia
or
between
brazil
and
south
africa
or
between
the
west
indies
and
the
mediterranean
or
between
a
part
of
the
andean
region
and
northeastern
asia
the
trouble
is
that
as
more
groups
of
animals
are
studied
from
the
standpoint
of
this
hypothesis
the
number
of
such
land
bridges
demanded
to
account
for
the
existing
facts
of
animal
distribution
is
constantly
and
indefinitely
extended
a
recent
book
by
one
of
the
most
learned
advocates
of
this
hypothesis
calls
for
at
least
ten
such
land
bridges
between
south
america
and
all
the
other
continents
present
and
past
of
the
world
since
a
period
geologically
not
very
remote
these
land
bridges
moreover
must
many
of
them
have
been
literally
bridges
long
narrow
tongues
of
land
thrust
in
every
direction
across
the
broad
oceans
according
to
this
view
the
continental
land
masses
have
been
in
a
fairly
fluid
condition
of
instability
by
parity
of
reasoning
the
land
bridges
could
be
made
a
hundred
instead
of
merely
ten
in
number
the
facts
of
distribution
are
in
many
cases
inexplicable
with
our
present
knowledge
yet
if
the
existence
of
widely
separated
but
closely
allied
forms
is
habitually
to
be
explained
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
extremists
of
this
school
we
could
from
the
exclusive
study
of
certain
groups
of
animals
conclude
that
at
different
periods
the
united
states
and
almost
every
other
portion
of
the
earth
were
connected
by
land
and
severed
from
all
other
regions
by
water
and
from
the
study
of
certain
other
groups
of
animals
arrive
at
directly
opposite
and
incompatible
conclusions
the
most
brilliant
and
unsafe
exponent
of
this
school
was
ameghino
who
possessed
and
abused
two
gifts
both
essential
to
the
highest
type
of
scientist
and
both
mischievous
unless
this
scientist
possess
a
rare
and
accurate
habit
of
thought
joined
to
industry
and
mastery
of
detail
namely
the
gift
of
clear
and
interesting
writing
and
the
gift
of
generalization
ameghino
rendered
marked
services
to
paleontology
but
he
generalized
with
complete
recklessness
from
the
slenderest
data
and
even
these
data
he
often
completely
misunderstood
or
misinterpreted
his
favorite
thesis
included
the
origin
of
mammalian
life
and
of
man
himself
in
southernmost
south
america
with
as
incidents
the
belief
that
the
strata
of
south
america
were
of
much
greater
age
than
the
strata
with
corresponding
remains
elsewhere
that
in
south
america
various
species
and
genera
of
men
existed
in
tertiary
times
some
of
them
at
least
as
advanced
as
fairly
well
advanced
modern
savages
that
there
existed
various
land
bridges
between
south
america
and
other
southern
continents
including
africa
and
that
the
ancestral
types
of
modern
mammals
and
of
man
himself
wandered
across
one
of
these
bridges
to
the
old
world
and
that
thence
their
remote
descendants
after
ages
of
time
returned
to
the
new
in
addition
to
valuable
investigations
of
beds
in
the
argentine
he
made
some
excellent
general
suggestions
such
as
that
the
pithecoid
apes
like
the
baboons
do
not
stand
in
the
line
of
man
ancestral
stem
but
represent
a
divergence
from
it
away
from
humanity
and
toward
a
retrogressive
bestialization
but
of
his
main
theses
he
proves
none
and
what
evidence
we
have
tells
against
them
at
the
museum
of
la
plata
i
found
that
the
authorities
were
practically
a
unit
in
regarding
his
remains
of
tertiary
men
and
men
as
being
either
the
remains
of
tertiary
american
monkeys
or
of
american
indians
from
strata
that
were
long
the
extraordinary
discovery
due
to
that
eminent
scientist
and
public
servant
doctor
moreno
of
the
remains
of
man
associated
with
the
remains
of
the
great
extinct
south
american
fauna
of
the
mylodon
of
a
giant
ungulate
of
a
huge
cat
like
the
lion
and
of
an
extraordinary
aberrant
horse
of
a
wholly
different
genus
from
the
modern
horse
conclusively
shows
that
in
its
later
stages
the
south
american
fauna
consisted
largely
of
types
that
elsewhere
had
already
disappeared
and
that
these
types
persisted
into
what
was
geologically
a
very
recent
period
only
some
tens
of
thousands
of
years
ago
when
savage
man
of
practically
a
modern
type
had
already
appeared
in
south
america
the
evidence
we
have
so
far
as
it
goes
tends
to
show
that
the
south
american
fauna
always
has
been
more
archaic
in
type
than
the
arctogeal
fauna
of
the
same
chronological
level
to
loose
generalizations
and
to
elaborate
misinterpretations
of
paleontological
records
the
kind
of
work
done
by
haseman
furnishes
an
invaluable
antiscorbutic
to
my
mind
he
has
established
a
stronger
presumption
in
favor
of
the
theory
he
champions
than
has
been
established
in
favor
of
the
theories
of
any
of
the
learned
and
able
scientific
men
from
whose
conclusions
he
dissents
further
research
careful
accurate
and
long
extended
can
alone
enable
us
to
decide
definitely
in
the
matter
and
this
research
to
be
effective
must
be
undertaken
by
many
men
each
of
whom
shall
in
large
measure
possess
haseman
exceptional
power
of
laborious
work
both
in
the
field
and
in
the

his
insight
and
accuracy
of
observation
and
his
determination
to
follow
truth
with
inflexible
rectitude
wherever
it
may
lead
one
of
the
greatest
among
the
many
great
qualities
which
lifted
huxley
and
darwin
above
their
fellows
appendix

the

south

many
different

of

that
it

an

through

tropical

region
even
if
the

chiefly
done
by

offers
a
very
difficult
problem
all
that
i
can
pretend
to
do
is
to
give
a
few
hints
as
the
results
of
our
own
experience
for

there
should
be
a
hammock
and
light
blanket
these
can
be
obtained
in

for

a
light
fly
is
ample
ours
were
brought
with
us
from
new
york
in
exploring
only
the
open
fly
should
be
taken
but
on
trips
where
weight
of
luggage
is
no
objection
there
can
be
walls
to
the
tent
and
even
a
canvas
cloth
and
a
camp
table
should
be
brought
any
good
outfitter
in
the
united
states
will
supply
them
and
not
thrown
away
until
it
becomes
imperative
to
cut
everything
down
on
a
river
trip
pulleys
and
ropes
preferably
steel
and
at
any
rate
very
strong
should
be
taken
unless
the
difficulties
of
transportation
are
insuperable
canoes
such
as
can
be
obtained
from
various
firms
in
canada
and
the
united
states
should
by
all
means
be
taken
they
are
incomparably
superior
to
the
dugouts
but
on
different
rivers
wholly
different
canoes
of
wholly
different
sizes
will
be
needed
on
some
steam
or
electric
launches
may
be
used
it
is
not
possible
to
lay
down
a
general
rule
as
regards
arms
a
good
plain
shotgun
with
a
barrel
underneath
the
others
is
the
best
weapon
to
have
constantly
in
one
hand
in
the
south
american
forests
where
big
game
is
rare
and
yet
may
at
any
time
come
in
one
path
when
specially
hunting
the
jaguar
tapir
or
big
peccary
an
ordinary
light
repeating
rifle
the
or
is
preferable
no
heavy

is
necessary
for

tin
boxes
or

are
the
best
in
which
to
carry

spare

a
good
is
indispensable
nowadays
doctors
know
so
much
of
tropical
diseases
that
there
is
no
difficulty
in
fitting
one
out
it
is
better
not
to
make
the
trip
at
all
than
to
fail
to
take
an
ample
supply
of
quinine
pills
cholera
pills
and
cathartic
pills
come
next
in
importance
in

there
should
be
serum

should
be
taken
in
quantities
for

left
over
from

sun
helmets
are
best
in

are
infinitely
preferable
in
the

there
should
be
hobnailed
shoes
the
nails
many
and
small
not
few
and
large
and
also
moccasins
or
shoes
and
light
flexible

tastes
differ
in

i
like
mine
of
thick
wool
a

should
be
worn
or
as
a
better
substitute
a
khaki
jacket
with
many
pockets
very
light
underclothes
are
good
if
one
knees
and
legs
are
unfortunately
tender
knickerbockers
with
long
stockings
and
leggings
should
be
worn
ordinary
trousers
tend
to
bind
the
knee
better
still
if
one

will
stand
the
exposure
are
shorts
not
coming
down
to
the

a
kilt
would
probably
be
best
of
all
kermit
wore
shorts
in
the
brazilian
forest
as
he
had
already
worn
them
in
africa
in
mexico
and
in
the
new
brunswick
woods
some
of
the
best
modern
hunters
always
wear
shorts
as
for
example
that
sportsman
the
duke
of
alva
fiala
after
the
experience
of
his
trip
down
the
papagaio
the
juruena
and
the
tapajos
gives
his
judgment
about
equipment
and
provisions
as
follows
the
history
of
south
american
exploration
has
been
full
of
the
losses
of
canoes
and
cargoes
and
lives
the
native
canoe
made
from
the
single
trunk
of
a
forest
giant
is
the
craft
that
has
been
used
it
is
durable
and
if
lost
can
be
readily
replaced
from
the
forest
by
good
men
with
axes
and
adzes
but
because
of
its
great
weight
and
low
it
is
unsuitable
as
a
freight
carrier
and
by
reason
of
the
limitations
of
its
construction
is
not
of
the
correct
form
to
successfully
run
the
rapid
and
bad
waters
of
many
of
the
south
american
rivers
the
north
american
indian
has
undoubtedly
developed
a
vastly
superior
craft
in
the
canoe
and
with
it
will
run
rapids
that
a
south
american
indian
with
his
log
canoe
would
not
think
of
attempting
though
as
a
general
thing
the
south
american
indian
is
a
wonderful
waterman
the
equal
and
in
some
ways
the
superior
of
his
northern
contemporary
at
the
many
carries
or
portages
the
light
canoe
or
its
modern
representative
the
canoe
can
be
picked
up
bodily
and
carried
by
from
two
to
four
men
for
several
miles
if
necessary
while
the
log
canoe
has
to
be
hauled
by
ropes
and
labor
over
rollers
that
have
first
to
be
cut
from
trees
in
the
forest
or
at
great
risk
led
along
the
edge
of
the
rapids
with
ropes
and
hooks
and
poles

men
often
up
to
their
shoulders
in

rushing
waters

craft
to
a
place
of
safety
the
native
canoe
is
so
long
and
heavy
that
it
is
difficult
to
navigate
without
some
bumps
on
the
rocks
in
fact
it
is
usually
dragged
over
the
rocks
in
the
shallow
water
near
shore
in
preference
to
taking
the
risk
of
a
plunge
through
the
rushing
volume
of
deeper
water
for
reasons
stated
above
the
north
american
canoe
can
be
turned
with
greater
facility
in
critical
moments
in
bad
water
many
a
time
i
heard
my
steersman
exclaim
with
delight
as
we
took
a
difficult
passage
between
two
rocks
with
our
loaded
canadian
canoe
in
making
the
same
passage
the
dugout
would
go
sideways
toward
the
rapid
until
by
a
supreme
effort
her
three
powerful
paddlers
and
steersman
would
right
her
just
in
time
the
native
canoe
would
ship
great
quantities
of
water
in
places
the
canadian
canoe
came
through
without
taking
any
water
on
board
we
did
bump
a
few
rocks
under
water
but
the
canoe
was
so
elastic
that
no
damage
was
done
our
freight
canoe
a
type
especially
built
for
the
purpose
on
deep
full
lines
with
high
weighed
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
and
would
carry
a
ton
of
cargo
with
ease
and
also
take
it
safely
where
the
same
cargo
distributed
among
two
or
three
native
thirty
or
foot
canoes
would
be
lost
the
native
canoes
weigh
from
about
nine
hundred
to
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
and
more
in
view
of
the
above
facts
the
is
advised
to
take
with
him
the
north
american
canoe
if
he
intends
serious
work
two
canoes
would
be
a
good
arrangement
for
from
five
to
seven
men
with
at
least
one
steersman
and
two
paddlers
to
each
canoe
the
canoes
can
be
purchased
in
two
sizes
and
nested
for
transportation
an
arrangement
which
would
save
considerable
expense
in
freight
bills
at
least
six
paddles
should
be
packed
with
each
boat
in
length
four
and
one
half
four
and
three
fourths
and
five
feet
other
paddles
from
six
and
one
half
feet
to
eight
and
one
half
feet
should
be
provided
for
steering
oars
the
native
paddler
after
he
has
used
the
light
canadian
paddle
prefers
it
to
the
best
native
make
my
own
paddlers
lost
or
broke
all
of
their
own
paddles
so
as
to
get
the
north
american
ones
which
they
marked
with
their
initials
and
used
most
carefully
to
each
canoe
it
would
be
well
to
have
two
copper
air
tanks
one
fore
one
aft
a
in
each
with
a
screw
cover
on
hatch
in
these
tanks
could
be
kept
a
small
supply
of
matches
the
chronometer
or
watch
which
is
used
for
position
and
the
scientific
records
and
diary
of
course
the
fact
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
these
are
air
tanks
not
to
be
used
so
as
to
appreciably
diminish
their
buoyancy
each
canoe
should
also
carry
a
small
repair
kit
attached
to
one
of
the
thwarts
containing
cement
a
piece
of
canvas
same
as
cover
of
canoe
copper
tacks
rivets
and
some
galvanized
nails
a
good
hatchet
and
a
hammer
a
small
can
of
canoe
paint
spar
varnish
and
copper
paint
for
worn
places
would
be
a
protection
against
termites
and
torrential
downpours
in
concluding
the
subject
of
canoes
i
can
state
that
the
traveller
in
south
america
will
find
no
difficulty
in
disposing
of
his
craft
at
the
end
of
his
trip
motors
we
had
with
us
a
three
and
one
half
motor
which
could
be
attached
to
stern
or
gunwale
of
canoe
or
boat
it
was
made
by
the
evinrude
motor
company
who
had
a
magneto
placed
in
the
flywheel
of
the
engine
so
that
we
never
had
to
resort
to
the
battery
to
run
the
motor
though
the
motor
was
left
out
in
the
rain
and
sun
often
without
a
cover
by
careless
native
help
it
never
failed
us
we
found
it
particularly
valuable
in
going
against
the
strong
current
of
the
sepotuba
river
where
several
trips
were
made
the
motor
attached
to
a
heavy
boat
for
exploration
it
would
be
valuable
particularly
as
it
is
easily
portable
weighing
for
the
two
motor
fifty
pounds
for
three
and
one
half
one
hundred
pounds
if
a
carburetor
could
be
attached
so
that
kerosene
could
be
used
it
would
add
to
its
value
many
times
for
kerosene
can
be
purchased
almost
anywhere
in
south
america
tents
there
is
nothing
better
for
material
than
the
light
waterproof
sea
island
cotton
of
american
manufacture
made
under
the
trade
name
of
waterproof
silk
it
keeps
out
the
heaviest
rain
and
is
very
light
canvas
becomes
and
cravenetted
material
lets
the
water
through
a
waterproof
canvas
floor
is
a
luxury
and
though
it
adds
to
the
weight
it
may
with
advantage
be
taken
on
ordinary
trips
the
tent
should
be
eight
by
eight
or
eight
by
nine
feet
large
enough
to
swing
a
comfortable
hammock
a
waterproof
canvas
bag
a
envelope
for
the
tent
should
be
provided
native
help
is
as
a
rule
careless
and
the
bag
would
save
wear
and
tear
hammocks
the
hammock
is
the
south
american
bed
and
the
traveller
will
find
it
exceedingly
comfortable
after
leaving
the
larger
cities
and
settlements
a
bed
is
a
rare
object
all
the
houses
are
provided
with
extra
hammock
hooks
the
traveller
will
be
entertained
hospitably
and
after
dinner
will
be
given
two
hooks
upon
which
to
hang
his
hammock
for
he
will
be
expected
to
have
his
hammock
and
in
insect
time
his
net
if
he
has
nothing
else
as
a
rule
a
native
hammock
and
net
can
be
procured
in
the
field
but
it
is
best
to
take
a
comfortable
one
along
arranged
with
a
net
in
regard
to
the
folding
cot
it
is
heavy
and
its
numerous
legs
form
a
sort
of
highway
system
over
which
all
sorts
of
insects
can
crawl
up
to
the
sleeper
the
ants
are
special
pests
and
some
of
them
can
bite
with
the
enthusiastic
vigor
of
beasts
many
times
their
size
the
canvas
floor
in
a
tent
obviates
to
a
degree
the
insect
annoyance
the
headwaters
of
the
rivers
are
usually
reached
by
of
mules
and
oxen
the
primitive
also
comes
in
where
the
trail
is
not
too
bad
one
hundred
and
sixty
to
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
is
a
good
load
for
the
and
none
of
the
cases
should
weigh
more
than
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
each
case
should
be
marked
with
its
contents
and
gross
and
net
weight
in
kilos
for
personal
baggage
the
light
fibre
sample
case
used
by
travelling
men
in
the
united
states
does
admirably
the
regulation
fibre
case
with
its
metal
binding
sold
for
the
purpose
is
too
heavy
and
has
the
bad
feature
of
swelling
up
under
the
influence
of
rain
and
dampness
often
necessitating
the
use
of
an
axe
or
heavy
hammer
to
remove
cover
the
ordinary
fibre
trunk
is
good
for
rail
and
steamer
travel
but
it
is
absolutely
unpractical
for
or
canoe
the
fibre
sample
case
could
be
developed
into
a
container
particularly
fitted
for
exploration
the
fibre
should
be
soaked
in
hot
paraffin
and
then
calendered
or
this
case
could
then
be
covered
with
waterproof
canvas
with
throat
opening
like
a
the
waterproof
usually
sold
are
too
light
in
texture
and
wear
through
a
heavier
grade
should
be
used
the
small
is
very
convenient
for
hammock
and
clothing
but
generally
the
thing
wanted
will
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
bag
we
took
with
us
a
number
of
small
cotton
bags
as
cotton
is
very
absorbent
i
had
them
paraffined
each
bag
was
tagged
and
all
were
placed
in
the
large
the
light
fibre
case
described
above
made
just
the
right
size
for
mule
pack
divided
by
partitions
and
covered
with
a
would
prove
a
great
convenience
the
light
steel
boxes
made
in
england
for
travellers
in
india
and
africa
would
prove
of
value
in
south
american
exploration
they
have
the
advantage
of
being
insect
and
water
proof
and
the
disadvantage
of
being
expensive
it
would
be
well
if
the
traveller
measured
each
case
for
personal
equipment
and
computed
the
limit
of
weight
that
it
could
carry
and
still
float
by
careful
distribution
of
light
and
heavy
articles
in
the
different
containers
he
could
be
sure
of
his
belongings
floating
if
accidentally
thrown
into
the
water
it
is
not
always
possible
to
get
comfortable
native
saddles
they
are
all
constructed
on
heavy
lines
with
thick
padding
which
becomes
soaked
in
the
rainy
season
a
united
states
military
saddle
with
whitman
or
mcclellan
tree
would
be
a
positive
luxury
neither
of
them
is
padded
so
would
be
the
correct
thing
for
all
kinds
of
weather
the
regulation
army
is
also
advised
as
a
protection
for
the
mule
back
the
muleteer
should
wash
the
often
for
a
long
trip
through
a
game
country
it
would
be
well
to
have
a
carbine
boot
on
the
saddle
united
states
army
and
with
canteen
and
cup
in
a
large
much
time
and
labor
are
lost
every
morning
collecting
the
mules
which
strayed
while
grazing
it
would
pay
in
the
long
run
to
feed
a
little
corn
at
a
certain
hour
every
morning
in
camp
always
ringing
a
bell
or
blowing
a
horn
at
the
time
the
mules
would
get
accustomed
to
receiving
the
feed
and
would
come
to
camp
for
it
at
the
signal
all
the
rope
that
came
to
my
attention
in
south
america
was
strand
hemp
a
hard
material
good
for
standing
rigging
but
not
good
for
tackle
or
for
use
aboard
canoes
a
bolt
rope
of
best
manilla
made
in
new
bedford
should
be
taken
it
is
the
finest
and
most
pliable
line
in
the
world
as
any
old
whaler
will
tell
you
get
a
sailor
of
the
old
school
to
relay
the
coils
before
you
go
into
the
field
so
that
the
rope
will
be
ready
for
use
five
eighths
to
seven
eighths
inch
diameter
is
large
enough
a
few
balls
of
marline
come
in
conveniently
as
also
does
heavy
linen
a
should
be
provided
for
each
of
the
men
as
a
container
for
hammock
and
net
spare
clothing
and
a
very
small
waterproof
pouch
or
bag
should
be
furnished
also
for
matches
tobacco
etc
the
men
should
be
limited
to
one
each
these
bags
should
be
numbered
consecutively
in
fact
every
piece
in
the
entire
equipment
should
be
thus
numbered
and
a
list
kept
in
detail
in
a
book
the
explorer
should
personally
see
that
each
of
his
men
has
a
hammock
net
and
poncho
for
the
native
if
left
unsupervised
will
go
into
the
field
with
only
the
clothing
he
has
on
food
though
south
america
is
rich
in
food
and
food
possibilities
she
has
not
solved
the
problem
of
living
economically
on
her
frontiers
the
prices
asked
for
food
in
the
rubber
districts
we
passed
through
were
amazing
five
milreis
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
was
cheap
for
a
chicken
and
eggs
at
five
hundred
reis
fifteen
cents
apiece
were
a
rarity
sugar
was
bought
at
the
rate
of
one
to
two
milreis
a
kilo
in
a
country
where
grows
luxuriantly
the
main
dependence
is
the
mandioc
or
farina
as
it
is
called
it
is
the
bread
of
the
country
and
is
served
at
every
meal
the
native
puts
it
on
his
meat
and
in
his
soup
and
mixes
it
with
his
rice
and
beans
when
he
has
nothing
else
he
eats
the
farina
as
it
is
called
by
the
handful
it
is
seldom
cooked
the
small
mandioc
tubers
when
boiled
are
very
good
and
are
used
instead
of
potatoes
native
beans
are
nutritious
and
form
one
of
the
chief
foods
in
the
field
the
native
cook
wastes
much
time
generally
provided
with
an
inadequate
cooking
equipment
hours
are
spent
cooking
beans
after
the
day
work
and
then
of
course
they
are
often
only
partially
cooked
a
kettle
or
aluminum
dutch
oven
should
be
taken
along
large
enough
to
cook
enough
beans
for
both
breakfast
and
dinner
the
beans
should
be
cooked
all
night
a
fire
kept
burning
for
the
purpose
it
would
only
be
necessary
then
to
warm
the
beans
for
breakfast
and
dinner
the
two
south
american
meals
for
meat
the
rubber
hunter
and
explorer
depends
upon
his
rifle
and
the
rivers
are
full
of
fish
which
can
readily
be
caught

two
or
three
varieties
of
deer
and
two
varieties
of

can
occasionally
be
shot
and
most
of
the
monkeys
are
used
for
food
turtles
and
turtle
eggs
can
be
had
in

and
a
great
variety
of
birds
some
of
them
delicious
in

in
the
hot

climate
fresh
meat
will
not
keep
and
even
salted
meat
has
been
known
to
spoil
for
use
on
the
roosevelt
expedition
i
arranged
a
ration
for
five
men
for
one
day
packed
in
a
tin
box
the
party
which
went
down
the
duvida
made
each
ration
do
for
six
men
for
a
day
and
a
half
and
in
addition
gave
over
half
the
bread
or
hardtack
to
the
camaradas
by
placing
the
allowance
of
bread
in
this
same
box
it
was
lightened
sufficiently
to
float
if
dropped
into
water
there
were
seven
variations
in
the
arrangement
of
food
in
these
boxes
and
they
were
numbered
from
to
so
that
a
different
box
could
be
used
every
day
of
the
week
in
addition
to
the
food
each
box
contained
a
cake
of
soap
a
piece
of
two
boxes
of
matches
and
a
box
of
table
salt
these
tin
boxes
were
lacquered
to
protect
from
rust
and
enclosed
in
wooden
cases
for
transportation
a
number
in
large
type
was
printed
on
each
no
was
cased
separately
nos
and
and
and
were
cased
together
for
canoe
travel
the
idea
was
to
take
these
wooden
cases
off
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
personally
to
experience
the
management
of
these
food
cases
we
had
sent
them
all
ahead
by
train
for
the
explorers
of
the
duvida
river
the
exploration
of
the
papagaio
was
decided
upon
during
the
march
over

the

to
some
extent
by
the
size
of
the

be
purchased
on

austin

supplied
the
food
stores
for
my
polar
expedition
worked
day
and

to
complete
the
packing
of
the
rations
on
time
the
food
cases
described
above
were
used
on
colonel
descent
of
the
rio
da
duvida
and
also
by
the
party
who
journeyed
down
the

madeira
rivers
leo
miller
the
naturalist
who
was
a
member
of
the
party
arrived
in
manaos
brazil
while
i
was
there
and
in
answer
to
my
question
told
me
that
the
food
served
admirably
and
was
good
but
that
the
native
cooks
had
a
habit
of
opening
a
number
of
cases
at
a
time
to
satisfy
their
personal
desire
for
special
delicacies
bacon
was
the
article
most
sought
for
speaking
critically
for
a
strenuous
piece
of
work
like
the
exploration
of
the
duvida
the
food
was
somewhat
bulky
a
ration
arrangement
such
as
i
used
on
my
sledge
trips
north
would
have
contained
more
nutritious
elements
in
a
smaller
space
we
could
have
done
without
many
of
the
luxuries
but
the
exploration
of
the
duvida
had
not
been
contemplated
and
had
no
place
in
the
itinerary
mapped
out
in
new
york
the
change
of
plan
and
the
decision
to
explore
the
duvida
river
came
about
in
rio
janeiro
long
after
our
rations
had
been
made
out
and
shipped
matte
the
tea
of
brazil
and
paraguay
used
in
most
of
the
states
of
south
america
should
not
be
forgotten
it
is
a
valuable
beverage
with
it
a
native
can
do
a
wonderful
amount
of
work
on
little
food
upon
the
tired
traveller
it
has
a
very
refreshing
effect
doctor
peckolt
celebrated
chemist
of
rio
de
janeiro
has
compared
the
analysis
of
matte
with
those
of
green
tea
black
tea
and
coffee
and
obtained
the
following
result
in
parts
of
green
tea
black
tea
coffee
matte
natural
oil
chlorophyl
resin
tannin
alkaloids
mateina
extractive
substances
cellulose
and
fibres
ashes
manner
of
preparation
the
matte
tea
is
prepared
in
the
same
manner
as
the
indian
tea
that
is
to
say
by
pouring
upon
it
boiling
water
during
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
before
using
to
obtain
a
good
infusion
five
spoonfuls
of
matte
are
sufficient
for
a
litre
of
water
some
experiments
have
been
made
lately
with
the
use
of
matte
in
the
german
army
and
probably
it
would
be
a
valuable
beverage
for
the
use
of
our
own
troops
two
plates
and
a
cup
knife
fork
and
spoon
should
be
provided
for
each
member
of
the
party
the
united
states
army
kit
would
serve
admirably
each
man
should
be
numbered
to
correspond
with
the
number
on
his
an
aluminum
for
lightness
cooking
outfit
or
the
dutch
oven
mentioned
with
three
or
four
kettles
nested
within
a
coffee
pot
or
a
teapot
would
suffice
the
necessary
large
spoons
and
forks
for
the
cook
a
small
meat
grinder
and
a
half
dozen
skinning
knives
could
all
be
included
in
the
fibre
case
these
outfits
are
usually
sold
with
the
cups
plates
for
the
table
as
before
suggested
each
member
of
the
party
should
have
his
own
it
should
not
be
carried
with
the
general
cooking
outfit
by
separating
the
eating
equipments
thus
one
of
the
problems
of
hygiene
and
cleanliness
is
simplified
rifles
ammunition
a
heavy
rifle
is
not
advised
the
only
animals
that
can
be
classed
as
dangerous
are
the
jaguar
and
peccary
and
a
or
calibre
is
heavy
enough
for
such
game
the
winchester
or
remington
carbine
is
the
arm
generally
used
throughout
south
america
and
calibre
is
the
only
ammunition
that
one
can
depend
upon
securing
in
the
field
every
man
has
his
own
preference
for
an
arm
however
there
is
no
need
of
carrying
a
nine
or
ten
pound
weapon
when
a
rifle
weighing
only
from
six
and
three
fourths
to
seven
and
one
half
pounds
will
do
all
that
is
necessary
i
personally
prefer
the
rifle
as
it
can
be
used
for
birds
also
the
gun
combining
a
double
shotgun
and
a
rifle
is
an
excellent
weapon
and
it
is
particularly
valuable
for
the
collector
of
specimens
a
new
gun
has
just
come
on
the
market
which
may
prove
valuable
in
south
america
where
there
is
such
a
variety
of
game
a
gun
weighing
only
eight
and
one
fourth
pounds
it
has
two
shotgun
barrels
one
to
calibre
rifle
and
the
rib
separating
the
shotgun
barrels
is
bored
for
a
rifle
cartridge
the
latter
is
particularly
adapted
for
the
large
food
birds
which
a
heavy
rifle
bullet
might
tear
calibre
ammunition
is
also
very
light
and
the
long
calibre
exceedingly
powerful
unless
in
practice
it
proves
too
complicated
it
would
seem
to
be
a
good
arm
for
use
sixteen
to
twenty
gauge
is
large
enough
for
the
shotgun
barrels
too
much
emphasis
can
not
be
placed
upon
the
need
of
being
provided
with
good
weapons
after
the
loss
of
all
our
arms
in
the
rapids
we
secured
four
poor
rusty
rifles
which
proved
of
no
value
we
lost
three
deer
a
tapir
and
other
game
and
finally
gave
up
the
use
of
the
rifles
depending
upon
hook
and
line
a
or
calibre
high
power
automatic
pistol
with
six
or
seven
inch
barrel
would
prove
a
valuable
arm
to
carry
always
on
the
person
it
could
be
used
for
large
game
and
yet
would
not
be
too
large
for
food
birds
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
market
of
this
character
we
had
our
rifle
ammunition
packed
by
the
in
zinc
cases
of
one
hundred
rounds
each
a
metallic
strip
with
pull
ring
closing
the
two
halves
of
the
box
sixteen
gauge
were
packed
the
same
way
to
the
box
the
explorer
would
do
well
always
to
have
on
his
person
a
compass
a
light
waterproof
bag
containing
matches
a
waterproof
box
of
salt
and
a
strong
light
linen
or
silk
with
several
hooks
a
knife
and
an
automatic
at
his
belt
with
several
loaded
magazines
for
the
latter
in
his
pocket
thus
provided
if
accidentally
lost
for
several
days
in
the
forest
which
often
happens
to
the
rubber
hunters
in
brazil
he
will
be
provided
with
the
possibility
of
getting
game
and
making
himself
shelter
and
fire
at
night
fish
for
small
fish
like
the
pacu
and
piranha
an
ordinary
bass
hook
will
do
for
the
latter
because
of
its
sharp
teeth
a
hook
with
a
long
shank
and
leader
is
the
best
the
same
character
of
leader
is
best
on
the
hook
to
be
used
for
the
big
fish
a
tarpon
hook
will
hold
most
of
the
great
fish
of
the
rivers
a
light
rod
and
reel
would
be
a
convenience
in
catching
the
pacu
we
used
to
fish
for
the
latter
variety
in
the
quiet
pools
while
allowing
the
canoe
to
drift
and
always
saved
some
of
the
fish
as
bait
for
the
big
fellows
we
fished
for
the
pacu
as
the
native
does
kneading
a
ball
of
mandioc
farina
with
water
and
placing
it
on
the
hook
as
bait
i
should
not
be
surprised
though
if
it
were
possible
with
carefully
chosen
flies
to
catch
some
of
the
fish
that
every
once
in
a
while
we
saw
rise
to
the
surface
and
drag
some
luckless
insect
under
clothing
even
the
experienced
traveller
when
going
into
a
new
field
will
commit
the
crime
of
carrying
too
much
luggage
articles
which
he
thought
to
be
camp
necessities
become
camp
nuisances
which
worry
his
men
and
kill
his
mules
the
lighter
one
can
travel
the
better
in
the
matter
of
clothing
before
the
actual
wilderness
is
reached
the
costume
one
would
wear
to
business
in
new
york
in
summer
is
practical
for
most
of
south
america
except
of
course
the
high
mountain
regions
where
a
warm
wrap
is
necessary
a
white
or
natural
linen
suit
is
a
very
comfortable
garment
a
light
blue
unlined
serge
is
desirable
as
a
change
and
for
wear
in
rainy
weather
strange
to
relate
the
south
american
seems
to
have
a
fondness
for
stiff
collars
even
in
corumba
the
hottest
place
i
have
ever
been
in
the
native
does
not
think
he
is
dressed
unless
he
wears
one
of
these
stiff
abominations
around
his
throat
a
light
negligee
shirt
with
interchangeable
or
attached
soft
collars
is
vastly
preferable
in
the
frontier
regions
and
along
the
rivers
the
pajama
seems
to
be
the
conventional
garment
for
day
as
well
as
night
wear
several
such
suits
of
light
material
should
be
carried
the
more
ornamented
and
beautifully
colored
the
greater
favor
will
they
find
along
the
way
a
light
cravenetted
mackintosh
is
necessary
for
occasional
cool
evenings
and
as
a
protection
against
the
rain
it
should
have
no
cemented
rubber
seams
to
open
up
in
the
warm
moist
climate
yachting
oxfords
and
a
light
pair
of
leather
slippers
complete
the
outfit
for
steamer
travel
for
the
field
two
or
three
light
woollen
shirts
made
with
two
breast
pockets
with
buttoned
flaps
two
pairs
of
long
khaki
trousers
two
pairs
of
riding
breeches
a
khaki
coat
cut
military
fashion
with
four
pockets
with
buttoned
flaps
two
suits
of
pajamas
handkerchiefs
socks
would
be
necessary
the
poncho
should
extend
to
below
the
knees
and
should
be
provided
with
a
hood
large
enough
to
cover
the
helmet
it
should
have
no
cemented
seams
the
material
recently
adopted
by
the
united
states
army
for
ponchos
seems
to
be
the
best
for
footgear
the
traveller
needs
two
pairs
of
stout
high
hunting
shoes
built
on
the
moccasin
form
with
soles
hob
nails
should
be
taken
along
to
insert
if
the
going
is
over
rocky
places
it
is
also
advisable
to
provide
a
pair
of
very
light
leather
slipper
boots
to
reach
to
just
under
the
knee
for
wear
in
camp
they
protect
the
legs
and
ankles
from
insect
stings
and
bites
the
traveller
who
enters
tropical
south
america
should
protect
his
head
with
a
soft
felt
hat
with
ventilated
headband
or
the
best
and
lightest
pith
helmet
that
can
be
secured
one
large
enough
to
shade
the
face
and
back
of
neck
there
should
be
a
ventilating
space
all
around
the
the
wider
the
space
the
better
these
helmets
can
be
secured
in
rio
and
buenos
aires
with
face
plates
of
horsehair
are
the
best
protection
against
small
insect
pests
they
are
generally
made
too
small
and
the
purchaser
should
be
careful
to
get
one
large
enough
to
go
over
his
helmet
and
come
down
to
the
breast
several
pairs
of
loose
gloves
rather
long
in
the
wrist
will
be
needed
as
protection
against
the
flies
piums
and
boroshudas
which
draw
blood
with
every
bite
and
are
numerous
in
many
parts
of
south
america
a
waterproof
sun
umbrella
with
a
jointed
handle
about
six
feet
long
terminating
in
a
point
would
be
a
decided
help
to
the
scientist
at
work
in
the
field
a
net
fitting
around
the
edge
of
the
umbrella
would
make
it
insect
proof
when
folded
it
would
not
be
bulky
and
its
weight
would
be
negligible
such
an
umbrella
could
also
be
attached
with
a
special
clamp
to
the
thwart
of
a
canoe
and
so
prove
a
protection
from
both
sun
and
rain
there
are
little
personal
conveniences
which
sometimes
grow
into
necessities
one
of
these
in
my
own
case
was
a
little
electric
light
taken
for
the
purpose
of
reading
the
verniers
of
a
theodolite
or
sextant
in
star
observations
it
was
used
every
night
and
for
many
purposes
as
a
matter
of
necessity
where
insects
are
numerous
one
turns
to
the
protection
of
his
hammock
and
net
immediately
after
the
evening
meal
it
was
at
such
times
that
i
found
the
electric
lamp
so
helpful
reclining
in
the
hammock
i
held
the
stock
of
the
light
under
my
left
arm
and
with
diary
in
my
lap
wrote
up
my
records
for
the
day
i
sometimes
read
by
its
soft
steady
light
one
charge
of
battery
to
my
surprise
lasted
nearly
a
month
when
forced
to
pick
out
a
camping
spot
after
dark
an
experience
which
comes
to
every
traveller
in
the
tropics
in
the
rainy
season
we
found
its
light
very
helpful
neither
rain
nor
wind
could
put
it
out
and
the
light
could
be
directed
wherever
needed
the
charges
should
be
calculated
on
the
plan
of
one
for
every
three
weeks
the
acetylene
lamp
for
camp
illumination
is
an
advance
over
the
kerosene
lantern
it
has
been
found
that
for
equal
weight
the
carbide
will
give
more
light
than
kerosene
or
candle
the
carbide
should
be
put
in
small
containers
for
each
time
a
box
is
opened
some
of
the
contents
turns
into
gas
from
contact
with
the
moist
air
tools
three
or
four
good
axes
several
a
good
hatchet
with
hammer
head
and
should
be
in
the
tool
kit
in
addition
each
man
should
be
provided
with
a
belt
knife
and
a
machete
with
sheath
collins
makes
the
best
machetes
his
axes
too
are
excellent
the
called
foice
in
brazil
is
a
most
valuable
tool
for
clearing
away
small
trees
vines
and
it
is
marvellous
how
quickly
an
experienced
hand
can
clear
the
ground
in
a
forest
with
one
of
these
instruments
all
of
these
tools
should
have
handles
of
american
hickory
of
first
quality
and
several
extra
handles
should
be
taken
along
the
list
of
tools
should
be
completed
with
a
small
outfit
of
pliers
tweezers
files
the
character
of
course
depending
upon
the
mechanical
ability
of
the
traveller
and
the
scientific
instruments
he
has
with
him
that
might
need
repairs
survey
instruments
the
choice
of
instruments
will
depend
largely
upon
the
character
of
the
work
intended
if
a
compass
survey
will
suffice
there
is
nothing
better
than
the
cavalry
sketching
board
used
in
the
united
states
army
for
reconnaissance
with
a
careful
hand
it
approaches
the
high
degree
of
perfection
attained
by
the
method
it
is
particularly
adapted
for
river
survey
and
after
one
gets
accustomed
to
its
use
it
is
very
simple
if
the
prismatic
compass
is
preferred
nothing
smaller
than
two
and
one
half
inches
in
diameter
should
be
used
in
the
smaller
sizes
the
magnet
is
not
powerful
enough
to
move
the
dial
quickly
or
accurately
several
good
pocket
compasses
must
be
provided
they
should
all
have
needles
with
the
north
end
well
marked
and
degrees
engraved
in
metal
if
the
floating
dial
is
preferred
it
should
be
of
aluminum
and
nothing
smaller
than
two
and
one
half
inches
for
the
same
reason
as
mentioned
above
regarding
the
prismatic
compass
expense
should
not
be
spared
if
it
is
necessary
to
secure
good
compasses
avoid
paper
dials
and
leather
cases
which
absorb
moisture
the
compass
case
should
allow
taking
apart
for
cleaning
and
drying
the
regular
chronometer
movement
because
of
its
delicacy
is
out
of
the
question
for
rough
land
or
water
travel
we
had
with
us
a
sized
movement
recently
brought
out
by
the
waltham
company
as
a
yacht
chronometer
it
gave
a
surprisingly
even
rate
under
the
most
adverse
conditions
i
was
sorry
to
lose
it
in
the
rapids
of
the
papagaio
when
our
canoes
went
down
the
watches
should
be
waterproof
with
strong
cases
and
several
should
be
taken
it
would
be
well
to
have
a
dozen
cheap
but
good
watches
and
the
same
number
of
compasses
for
use
around
camp
and
for
gifts
or
trade
along
the
line
of
travel
money
is
of
no
value
after
one
leaves
the
settlements
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
many
of
the
rubber
hunters
were
not
provided
with
compasses
and
i
listened
to
an
american
who
told
of
having
been
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
great
forest
where
for
days
he
lived
on
monkey
meat
secured
with
his
rifle
until
he
found
his
way
to
the
river
he
had
no
compass
and
could
not
get
one
i
was
sorry
i
had
none
to
give
i
had
lost
mine
in
the
rapids
for
the
determination
of
latitude
and
longitude
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
small
four
or
five
inch
theodolite
not
over
fifteen
pounds
in
weight
it
should
have
a
good
prism
eyepiece
with
an
angle
tube
attached
so
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
break
one
neck
in
reading
high
altitudes
for
days
we
travelled
in
the
direction
the
sun
was
going
with
altitudes
varying
from
to
because
of
these
high
altitudes
of
the
sun
the
sextant
with
artificial
horizon
could
not
be
used
unless
one
depended
upon
star
observations
altogether
an
uncertain
dependence
because
of
the
many
cloudy
nights
barometers
the
goldsmith
form
of
aneroid
is
the
most
accurate
portable
instrument
and
of
course
should
be
compared
with
a
standard
mercurial
at
the
last
station
thermometers
a
swing
thermometer
with
wet
and
dry
bulbs
for
determination
of
the
amount
of
moisture
in
the
air
and
the
maximum
and
minimum
thermometer
of
the
or
type
should
be
provided
with
a
case
to
protect
them
from
injury
a
tape
measure
with
metric
scale
of
measurements
on
one
side
and
feet
and
inches
on
the
other
is
most
important
two
small
light
waterproof
cases
could
be
constructed
and
packed
with
scientific
instruments
data
and
spare
clothing
and
yet
not
exceed
the
weight
limit
of
flotation
in
transit
by
these
two
cases
would
form
but
one
mule
load
photographic
from
the
experience
gained
in
several
fields
of
exploration
it
seems
to
me
that
the
voyager
should
limit
himself
to
one
camera
which
he
can
always
have
with
him
and
then
carry
a
duplicate
of
it
soldered
in
tin
in
the
baggage
the
duplicate
need
not
be
equipped
with
as
expensive
a
lens
and
shutter
as
the
camera
carried
for
work
x
is
a
good
size
nothing
larger
than
x
is
advised
we
carried
the
special
kodak
and
found
it
a
light
strong
and
effective
instrument
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ideal
form
of
instrument
would
be
one
with
a
front
board
large
enough
to
contain
an
adapter
fitted
for
three
lenses
for
the
x
one
lens
or
focus
one
lens
or
focus
one
lens
telephoto
or
telecentric
to
focus
the
camera
should
be
made
of
metal
and
fitted
with
shutter
and
direct
a
sole
leather
case
with
should
contain
the
camera
and
lenses
with
an
extra
roll
of
films
all
within
instant
reach
so
that
a
lens
could
be
changed
without
any
loss
of
time
plates
of
course
are
the
best
but
their
weight
and
frailty
with
difficulty
of
handling
rule
them
out
of
the
question
the
roll
film
is
the
best
as
the
film
pack
sticks
together
and
the
stubs
pull
off
in
the
moist
hot
climate
the
films
should
be
purchased
in
rolls
of
six
exposures
each
roll
in
a
tin
the
cover
sealed
with
surgical
tape
twelve
of
these
tubes
should
be
soldered
in
a
tin
box
in
places
where
the
air
is
charged
with
moisture
a
roll
of
films
should
not
be
left
in
a
camera
over
hours
tank
development
is
best
for
the
field
the
tanks
provided
for
developing
by
the
kodak
company
are
best
for
fixing
also
a
nest
of
tanks
would
be
a
convenience
one
tank
should
be
kept
separate
for
the
as
suggested
in
the
kodak
circular
for
tropical
development
a
tank
can
be
used
for
holding
the
freezing
mixture
of
hypo
this
same
tank
would
become
the
fixing
tank
after
development
in
the
rainy
season
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
dry
films
development
in
the
field
with
washing
water
at
degrees
is
a
operation
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
a
small
with
a
supply
of
chloride
of
calcium
in
small
tubes
might
solve
the
problem
of
preserving
films
in
the
tropics
the
and
supply
of
chloride
of
calcium
would
not
be
as
heavy
or
bulky
as
the
tanks
and
powders
needed
for
development
by
means
of
the
the
films
could
be
sealed
in
tin
tubes
free
from
moisture
and
kept
thus
until
arrival
at
home
or
at
a
city
where
the
air
was
fairly
dry
and
cold
water
for
washing
could
be
had
while
i
cordially
agree
with
most
of
the
views
expressed
by
fiala
there
are
some
as
to
which
i
disagree
for
instance
we
came
very
strongly
to
the
conclusion
in
descending
the
duvida
where
bulk
was
of
great
consequence
that
the
films
should
be
in
rolls
of
ten
or
twelve
exposures
i
doubt
whether
the
gun
would
be
practical
but
this
is
a
matter
of
personal
taste
appendix
my
letter
of
may
to
general
lauro
muller
the
first
report
on
the
expedition
made
by
me
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
manaos
and
published
in
rio
janeiro
upon
its
receipt
is
as
follows
may
to
his
excellency
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
my
dear
general
lauro
muller
i
wish
first
to
express
my
profound
acknowledgments
to
you
personally
and
to
the
other
members
of
the
brazilian
government
whose
generous
courtesy
alone
rendered
possible
the
expedicao
scientifica
rondon
i
wish
also
to
express
my
high
admiration
and
regard
for
colonel
rondon
and
his
associates
who
have
been
my
colleagues
in
this
work
of
exploration
in
the
third
place
i
wish
to
point
out
that
what
we
have
just
done
was
rendered
possible
only
by
the
hard
and
perilous
labor
of
the
brazilian
telegraphic
commission
in
the
unexplored
western
wilderness
of
matto
grosso
during
the
last
seven
years
we
have
had
a
hard
and
somewhat
dangerous
but
very
successful
trip
no
less
than
six
weeks
were
spent
in
slowly
and
with
peril
and
exhausting
labor
forcing
our
way
down
through
what
seemed
a
literally
endless
succession
of
rapids
and
cataracts
for
days
we
saw
no
human
being
in
passing
these
rapids
we
lost
five
of
the
seven
canoes
with
which
we
started
and
had
to
build
others
one
of
our
best
men
lost
his
life
in
the
rapids
under
the
strain
one
of
the
men
went
completely
bad
shirked
all
his
work
stole
his
comrades
food
and
when
punished
by
the
sergeant
he
with
deliberation
murdered
the
sergeant
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
colonel
dog
running
ahead
of
him
while
hunting
was
shot
by
two
indians
by
his
death
he
in
all
probability
saved
the
life
of
his
master
we
have
put
on
the
map
a
river
about
kilometres
in
length
running
from
just
south
of
the
degree
to
north
of
the
degree
and
the
biggest
affluent
of
the
madeira
until
now
its
upper
course
has
been
utterly
unknown
to
every
one
and
its
lower
course
although
known
for
years
to
the
rubbermen
utterly
unknown
to
all
cartographers
its
source
is
between
the
and
parallels
of
latitude
south
and
between
longitude
degrees
and
longitude
degrees
west
from
greenwich
we
embarked
on
it
about
at
latitude
degrees
minute
south
and
longitude
degrees
west
after
that
its
entire
course
was
between
the
and
degrees
of
longitude
approaching
the
latter
most
closely
about
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
the
first
rapids
were
at
navaite
in
degrees
minutes
and
after
that
they
were
continuous
and
very
difficult
and
dangerous
until
the
rapids
named
after
the
murdered
sergeant
paishon
in
degrees
minutes
at
degrees
minutes
the
river
received
the
rio
kermit
from
the
left
at
degrees
minutes
the
marciano
avila
entered
it
from
the
right
at
degrees
minutes
the
taunay
entered
from
the
left
at
degrees
minutes
the
cardozo
entered
from
the
right
at
degrees
minutes
we
encountered
the
first
rubberman
the
rio
branco
entered
from
the
left
at
degrees
minutes
we
camped
at
degrees
minutes
or
approximately
the
boundary
line
between
matto
grosso
and
amazonas
the
confluence
with
the
upper
aripuanan
which
entered
from
the
right
was
in
degrees
minutes
the
mouth
where
it
entered
the
madeira
was
in
about
degrees
minutes
the
stream
we
have
followed
down
is
that
which
rises
farthest
away
from
the
mouth
and
its
general
course
is
almost
due
north
my
dear
sir
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
the
chance
to
take
part
in
this
great
work
of
exploration
with
high
regard
and
respect
believe
me
very
sincerely
yours
theodore
