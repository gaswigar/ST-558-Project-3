for

they
were
huddled
together
watching
her
with
awestruck
faces
then
somehow
marjorie
found
herself
blurting
out
the
entire
story
she
stared
at
it
in
consternation
a
patriotic
schoolgirl
chapter
i
off
to
dona
are
you
awake
donakins
i
say
old
sport
do
stir
yourself
and
blink
an
eye
what
a
dormouse
you
are
want
shaking
rouse
up
you
old
bluebottle
ca
you
i
been
awake
since
five
and
it
no
use
thumping
me
in
the
back
grunted
an
injured
voice
from
the
next
bed
it
too
early
yet
to
get
up
and
i
wish
you
leave
me
alone
the
huskiness
and
general
chokiness
of
the
tone
were
unmistakable
marjorie
leaned
over
and
took
a
keen
survey
of
that
portion
of
her
sister
face
which
was
not
buried
in
the
pillow
oh
the
atmosphere
damp
is
it
she
remarked
dona
ostriching
for
goodness
sake
brace
up
child
and
turn
off
the
i
thought
you
more
pluck
if
you
going
to
arrive
at
brackenfield
with
a
red
nose
and
your
eyes
all
bunged
up
i
disown
you
or
lose
you
on
the
way
crystal
clear
i
will
i
not
let
you
start
in
a
new
school
nicknamed
so
there
have
a
caramel
dona
sat
up
in
bed
and
arrested
her
tears
sufficiently
to
accept
the
creature
comfort
offered
her
as
its
consistency
was
decidedly
of
a
nature
the
mingled
sucking
and
sobbing
which
followed
produced
a
queer
combination
you
sound
like
a
seal
at
the
zoo
marjorie
assured
her
airily
cheer
oh
i
call
it
a
stunt
to
be
going
to
brackenfield
i
mean
to
have
a
time
there
and
no
mistake
it
all
very
well
for
you
sighed
dona
dolefully
you
been
at
a
before
and
i
have
and
you
are
not
shy
and
you
always
get
on
with
people
you
know
i
a
mum
mouse
and
i
hate
strangers
i
shall
just
endure
till
the
holidays
come
it
no
use
telling
me
to
brace
up
for
there
nothing
to
brace
about
in
the
bedroom
where
the
two
girls
lay
talking
every
preparation
had
been
made
for
a
journey
two
new
trunks
painted
respectively
with
the
initials
d
a
and
e
a
stood
side
by
side
with
the
lids
open
filled
to
the
brim
except
for
and
a
few
other
items
which
must
be
put
in
at
the
last
weeks
of
concentrated
thought
and
practical
work
on
the
part
of
mother
two
aunts
and
a
dressmaker
had
preceded
the
packing
of
those
boxes
for
the
requirements
of
brackenfield
seemed
numerous
and
the
list
of
essential
garments
resembled
a
trousseau
there
were
school
skirts
and
blouses
gymnasium
costumes
sunday
dresses
evening
wear
and
party
frocks
to
say
nothing
of
underclothes
and
such
details
as
gloves
shoes
ties
ribbons
and
handkerchiefs
books
photos
and
two
each
containing
necessaries
for
the
first
night
stood
by
the
trunks
and
two
umbrellas
with
two
were
already
strapped
up
with
mackintoshes
and
winter
coats
for
both
the
girls
this
morning
would
make
a
new
and
very
important
chapter
in
the
story
of
their
lives
marjorie
had
indeed
already
been
at
but
it
was
a
comparatively
small
establishment
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
breath
with
a
place
so
important
as
brackenfield
and
giving
only
a
foretaste
of
those
experiences
which
she
expected
to
encounter
in
a
wider
circle
she
had
been
tolerably
popular
at
hilton
house
but
she
had
made
several
mistakes
which
she
was
determined
not
to
repeat
and
meant
to
be
careful
as
to
the
first
impressions
which
she
produced
upon
her
new
schoolfellows
marjorie
at
fifteen
and
a
half
was
a
somewhat
problematical
character
in
her
childhood
she
had
been
aptly
described
as
a
little
madam
and
it
was
owing
to
the
very
turbulent
effect
of
her
presence
in
the
family
that
she
had
been
packed
off
early
to
school
to
find
her
level
among
other
girls
and
leave
a
little
peace
at
home
as
aunt
vera
expressed
it
finding
one
level
is
generally
rather
a
stormy
process
so
after
four
years
of
at
hilton
house
marjorie
was
on
the
whole
not
at
all
sorry
to
leave
and
transfer
her
energies
to
another
sphere
she
meant
well
but
she
was
always
that
she
was
right
and
though
this
line
of
action
may
serve
with
weaker
characters
it
is
liable
to
cause
friction
when
practised
upon
equals
or
elders
whose
views
are
also
as
regards
looks
marjorie
could
score
her
features
fresh
complexion
and
frank
grey
eyes
were
decidedly
prepossessing
and
her
pigtail
had
been
the
longest
and
thickest
and
glossiest
in
the
whole
crocodile
of
hilton
house
she
was
clever
if
she
chose
to
work
though
apt
to
argue
with
her
teachers
and
keen
at
games
if
she
could
win
but
showed
an
unsporting
tendency
to
lose
her
temper
if
the
odds
were
against
her
such
was
marjorie
crude
impetuous
and
full
of
overflowing
spirits
with
many
good
qualities
and
certain
disagreeable
traits
eager
to
loose
anchor
and
sail
away
from
the
harbour
of
home
and
the
narrow
waters
of
hilton
house
into
the
big
untried
sea
of
brackenfield
college
two
sisters
surely
never
presented
a
greater
contrast
than
the
anderson
girls
dona
at
thirteen
was
a
shy
retiring
amiable
little
person
with
an
unashamed
weakness
for
golliwogs
and
teddy
bears
specimens
of
which
in
various
sizes
decorated
the
mantelpiece
of
her
bedroom
she
was
accustomed
to
give
way
under
plaintive
protest
to
masterful
disposition
and
as
a
rule
played
second
fiddle
with
a
good
grace
she
was
not
at
all
clever
or
imaginative
but
very
affectionate
and
had
been
the
pet
of
the
family
at
home
she
was
a
neat
pretty
little
thing
with
big
blue
eyes
and
arched
eyebrows
and
silky
curls
exactly
like
a
sir
joshua
reynolds
portrait
and
she
had
a
pathetic
way
of
saying
oh
marjorie
when
snubbed
by
her
elder
sister
according
to
aunt
vera
if
marjorie
needed
to
find
her
level
dona
required
to
be
well
shaken
up
she
was
dreamy
and
unobservant
slow
in
her
ways
and
not
much
interested
in
any
special
subject
marjorie
cherished
ambitions
were
unknown
to
dona
who
liked
to
plod
along
in
an
easy
fashion
without
taking
very
much
trouble
her
daily
governess
had
found
it
difficult
to
rouse
any
enthusiasm
in
her
for
her
work
she
frankly
hated
lessons
it
was
a
subject
of
congratulation
to
anderson
that
the
two
girls
would
not
be
in
the
same
house
at
brackenfield
she
considered
that
dona
character
had
no
chance
for
development
under
the
shadow
of
marjorie
overbearing
ways
and
that
among
companions
of
her
own
age
she
might
perhaps
find
a
few
congenial
friends
who
would
help
her
to
realize
that
she
had
entered
her
teens
and
would
interest
her
in
girlish
matters
poor
dona
by
no
means
shared
her
mother
satisfaction
at
the
arrangements
for
her
future
she
would
have
preferred
to
be
with
marjorie
and
was
appalled
at
the
idea
of
being
obliged
to
face
a
houseful
of
strangers
she
met
with
little
sympathy
from
her
own
family
in
this
respect
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
old
sport
preached
peter
an
authority
of
eleven
with
three
years
of
experience
behind
him
i
felt
a
bit
queer
myself
you
know
when
i
first
went
to
the
grange
but
one
soon
gets
over
that
you
shake
down
i
do
want
to
shake
down
bleated
dona
it
a
shame
i
should
have
to
go
at
all
you
ca
any
of
you
understand
how
i
feel
you
all
beasts
they
allow
you
a
bucket
to
weep
into
for
the
first
day
or
two
poor
old
bunting
said
larry
consolingly
it
wo
be
so
much
kindness
on
their
part
as
a
desire
to
save
the
carpets
salt
water
takes
the
colour
out
of
things
so
but
i
fancy
they
limit
you
to
a
week
wailing
and
if
you
do
turn
off
the
tap
after
that
they
send
for
a
doctor
who
prescribe
turkey
rhubarb
and
senna
mixed
with
quinine
it
a
stock
school
prescription
for
shirking
harmless
you
know
but
particularly
nasty
you
have
the
taste
in
your
mouth
for
days
oh
cheer
up
for
goodness
sake
look
here
if
i
really
sent
to
the
camp
at
denley
i
come
and
look
you
up
and
take
you
out
to
tea
somewhere
how
would
that
suit
your
ladyship
would
you
really
will
you
promise
honest
injun
i
will
then
i
do
mind
quite
so
much
as
i
did
though
i
still
hate
the
thought
of
school
conceded
dona
the
andersons
generally
described
themselves
as
a
large
and
rambling
family
guaranteed
sound
and
quiet
in
harness
but
capable
of
taking
fences
if
required
nora
the
eldest
had
been
married
a
year
ago
bevis
was
in
the
navy
leonard
was
serving
somewhere
in
france
larry
who
had
just
left
school
had
been
called
up
and
was
going
into
training
and
after
marjorie
and
dona
followed
peter
cyril
and
joan
marjorie
and
dona
always
declared
that
if
they
could
have
been
consulted
in
the
matter
of
precedence
they
would
not
have
chosen
to
arrive
in
the
exact
centre
of
a
big
family
nora
as
eldest
and
joan
as
youngest
occupied
definite
and
recognized
positions
but
middle
girls
rarely
receive
as
much
attention
dona
indeed
had
claimed
a
certain
share
of
petting
but
marjorie
considered
herself
badly
treated
by
the
fates
i
wish
i
were
the
only
one
she
assured
the
others
think
how
i
be
appreciated
then
we
swop
you
with
pleasure
madam
if
you
wish
returned
larry
ironically
i
should
suggest
an
advertisement
such
as
this
situation
as
only
daughter
in
eligible
family
eight
brothers
and
sisters
given
in
exchange
a
month
approval
no
better
not
put
that
in
or
they
send
you
packing
back
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
brothers
are
beasts
pouted
marjorie
throwing
a
cushion
at
larry
to
express
her
indignation
what
i
like
would
be
for
mother
to
take
me
away
for
a
year
or
let
me
study
art
or
music
or
something
just
with
her
mamie
page
mother
went
with
her
to
paris
and
they
a
gorgeous
time
that
my
ambition
and
mine
just
to
be
allowed
to
stop
at
home
added
dona
plaintively
neither
marjorie
nor
dona
wishes
however
were
considered
at
the
powers
that
be
had
decided
that
they
were
to
be
educated
at
brackenfield
college
their
boxes
were
ready
packed
and
their
train
was
to
leave
at
nine
by
railway
time
mother
saw
them
off
at
the
station
i
wish
i
could
have
taken
you
she
said
rather
anxiously
but
i
think
you
manage
the
journey
all
right
you
both
together
and
marjorie
a
big
girl
now
and
used
to
travelling
you
only
to
cross
the
platform
at
rosebury
to
get
the
london
train
and
a
teacher
is
to
meet
you
at
euston
you
know
her
by
the
brackenfield
badge
and
be
sure
you
do
speak
to
anyone
else
call
out
of
the
window
for
a
porter
when
you
reach
rosebury
you
plenty
of
time
to
change
well
chicks
be
good
girls
do
forget
to
send
me
that
telegram
from
euston
write
as
soon
as
you
can
do
lean
against
the
door
of
the
carriage
you
just
off
now
as
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
dona
sank
into
her
place
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
starting
for
the
stake
and
mopped
her
eyes
with
her
already
damp
marjorie
after
many
similar
partings
settled
herself
in
the
next
seat
and
pulling
out
an
illustrated
paper
from
her
bag
began
to
read
the
train
was
very
full
and
the
girls
had
with
difficulty
found
room
soldiers
on
leave
were
returning
to
the
front
and
filled
the
corridor
dona
and
marjorie
were
crammed
in
between
a
stout
woman
who
nursed
a
basket
containing
a
mewing
kitten
and
a
wizened
little
man
with
an
irritating
cough
opposite
sat
three
tommies
and
an
elderly
lady
with
a
long
thin
nose
and
prominent
teeth
who
entered
into
conversation
with
the
soldiers
and
proffered
them
much
good
advice
with
an
epitome
of
her
ideas
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
the
distance
from
silverwood
to
rosebury
was
only
thirty
miles
and
the
train
was
due
to
arrive
at
the
junction
with
minutes
to
spare
for
the
london
express
on
all
ordinary
occasions
it
jogged
along
in
a
commonplace
fashion
and
turned
up
up
to
time
however
it
behaved
with
unusual
eccentricity
and
instead
of
passing
the
signals
at
meriton
it
slowed
up
and
whistled
and
finally
stood
still
upon
the
bridge
must
be
something
blocking
the
line
observed
one
of
the
tommies
looking
out
of
the
window
i
do
hope
it
not
an
accident
the
company
is
so
terribly
understaffed
at
present
and
the
work
far
too
long
hours
and
are
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
at
their
posts
began
the
thin
lady
nervously
always
had
a
horror
of
railway
accidents
i
wish
i
taken
an
insurance
ticket
before
i
started
can
you
see
anything
on
the
line
my
good
man
is
there
any
danger
the
tommy
drew
in
his
head
and
smiled
it
was
a
particularly
head
with
twinkling
brown
eyes
and
a
very
humorous
smile
not
so
long
as
the
train
is
standing
still
he
replied
i
think
they
get
us
back
to
the
front
this
time
we
probably
have
to
wait
till
something
passes
us
it
just
a
matter
of
patience
his
words
were
justified
for
in
about
ten
minutes
an
express
roared
by
after
which
event
their
train
once
more
started
and
jogged
along
to
rosebury
we
horribly
late
whispered
marjorie
to
dona
consulting
her
watch
i
hope
to
goodness
there
be
no
more
stops
it
running
the
thing
very
fine
i
can
tell
you
i
glad
we
only
to
cross
the
platform
i
get
a
porter
as
fast
as
i
can
but
when
they
reached
rosebury
the
stout
woman
and
the
basket
with
the
kitten
got
in
the
way
and
the
elderly
lady
jammed
up
the
door
with
her
so
that
by
the
time
dona
and
marjorie
managed
to
get
themselves
and
their
belongings
out
of
the
carriage
the
very
few
porters
available
had
already
been
commandeered
by
other
people
the
girls
ran
to
the
van
at
the
back
of
the
train
where
the
guard
was
turning
out
the
luggage
their
boxes
were
on
the
platform
amid
a
pile
of
bags
and
portmanteaux
their
extreme
newness
made
them
easily
recognizable
even
without
the
conspicuous
initials
what
are
we
to
do
cried
marjorie
we
miss
the
london
train
i
know
we
shall
here
dona
let
take
them
ourselves
she
seized
one
of
the
boxes
by
the
handle
and
tried
to
drag
it
along
the
platform
but
its
weight
was
prohibitive
after
a
couple
of
yards
she
stopped
exhausted
better
leave
your
luggage
and
let
it
follow
you
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow
if
you
want
the
euston
express
you
have
to
make
a
run
for
it
marjorie
turned
round
quickly
the
speaker
was
the
young
tommy
who
had
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
when
the
line
was
blocked
his
dark
eyes
were
still
twinkling
the
train
over
there
and
they
shutting
the
doors
he
urged
here
i
take
this
for
you
if
you
like
best
hurry
up
he
had
his
heavy
to
carry
but
he
shouldered
the
girls
pile
of
wraps
umbrellas
and
in
addition
to
his
own
burden
and
set
off
along
the
platform
while
marjorie
and
dona
much
encumbered
with
their
bags
and
a
few
odd
parcels
followed
in
his
wake
it
was
a
difficult
progress
for
everybody
seemed
to
get
into
their
way
and
just
as
they
neared
the
express
the
guard
waved
his
green
flag
stand
back
stand
back
shouted
an
official
as
the
girls
made
a
last
wild
spurt
the
whistle
sounded
the
guard
jumped
into
the
van
and
with
a
loud
clanging
of
the
train
started
they
had
missed
it
by
exactly
five
seconds
hard
luck
said
the
tommy
depositing
the
wraps
upon
the
platform
you
have
to
wait
two
hours
for
the
next
you
get
your
luggage
at
any
rate
oh
it
all
right
as
marjorie
murmured
thanks
i
only
sorry
you
missed
it
and
he
hailed
a
companion
and
was
gone
it
was
awfully
kind
of
him
commented
dona
still
panting
from
her
run
kind
he
a
gentleman
there
was
no
mistaking
that
replied
marjorie
the
two
girls
had
now
to
face
the
very
unpleasant
fact
that
they
had
missed
the
connection
and
that
the
teacher
who
was
to
meet
them
at
euston
would
look
for
them
in
vain
they
wondered
whether
she
would
wait
for
the
next
train
and
if
she
did
not
how
they
were
going
to
get
across
london
to
the
great
western
railway
station
marjorie
felt
very
doubtful
as
to
whether
her
experience
of
travelling
would
be
equal
to
the
emergency
she
hid
her
fears
however
from
dona
whose
countenance
was
quite
sufficiently
woebegone
already
we
get
chocolates
out
of
the
automatic
machine
and
buy
something
to
read
at
the
bookstall
she
suggested
two
hours
wo
last
for
ever
dona
cheered
up
a
little
at
the
sight
of
magazines
and
picked
out
a
periodical
with
a
soldier
upon
the
cover
marjorie
whose
taste
in
literature
inclined
to
the
sensational
reviewed
the
books
and
chose
one
with
a
startling
picture
depicting
a
phantom
in
the
act
of
disturbing
a
she
was
too
agitated
to
read
more
than
a
few
pages
of
it
but
she
thought
it
seemed
interesting
the
two
hours
were
over
at
last
and
the
girls
and
their
luggage
were
safely
installed
in
the
london
train
by
a
porter
it
was
a
long
journey
to
euston
after
their
early
start
and
the
excitement
at
rosebury
both
felt
tired
and
even
marjorie
looked
decidedly
sober
when
they
reached
their
destination
each
was
wearing
the
brackenfield
badge
which
had
been
forwarded
to
them
from
the
school
and
by
which
the
mistress
was
to
identify
them
as
they
left
the
carriage
they
glanced
anxiously
at
the
coat
of
each
lady
who
passed
them
on
the
platform
to
descry
a
similar
rosette
all
in
vain
everybody
was
in
a
hurry
and
nobody
sported
the
brackenfield
colours
we
shall
have
to
get
a
taxi
and
manage
as
best
we
can
sighed
marjorie
i
wish
the
porters
were
so
stupid
i
ca
make
them
listen
to
me
the
taxis
will
all
be
taken
up
if
we
not
quick
oh
i
say
there
that
tommy
again
i
wonder
if
he
hail
us
one
i
declare
i
ask
him
hail
you
a
taxi
with
pleasure
replied
the
young
soldier
as
marjorie
impulsively
stopped
him
and
urged
her
request
have
you
got
your
luggage
this
time
yes
yes
it
all
here
and
we
found
a
porter
only
he
so
slow
and
are
you
marjorie
and
dona
anderson
interrupted
a
sharp
voice
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
who
is
this
you
speaking
to
do
know
then
come
along
with
me
immediately
no
certainly
not
i
get
a
taxi
myself
where
is
your
luggage
the
speaker
was
tall
and
fair
with
eyes
and
she
wore
the
unmistakable
brackenfield
badge
so
her
words
carried
authority
she
bustled
the
girls
off
in
a
tremendous
hurry
and
their
good
samaritan
of
a
soldier
melted
away
amongst
the
crowd
i
been
waiting
hours
for
you
how
did
you
miss
your
train
asked
the
mistress
why
did
you
go
and
stand
under
the
clock
as
you
were
told
in
the
head
mistress
letter
and
do
you
know
that
you
must
address
strangers
she
angry
with
you
for
speaking
to
the
tommy
whispered
dona
to
marjorie
as
the
pair
followed
their
new
guardian
i
ca
help
it
he
would
have
got
us
a
taxi
and
now
they
all
gone
and
we
must
put
up
with
a
i
could
see
any
clock
and
no
wonder
we
missed
her
in
such
a
crowd
i
think
she
hateful
and
i
not
going
to
like
her
a
scrap
no
more
am

brackenfield
college
brackenfield
college
stood
on
the
hills
about
a
mile
from
the
seaside
town
of
whitecliffe
it
had
been
built
for
a
school
and
was
large
and
modern
and
entirely
it
had
a
gymnasium
a
library
a
studio
a
chemical
laboratory
a
a
kitchen
for
a
special
block
for
music
and
and
a
large
assembly
hall
outside
there
were
many
acres
of
lawns
and
a
large
vegetable
garden
and
a
little
wood
with
a
stream
running
through
it
the
girls
lived
in
three
hostels
for
seniors
intermediates
and
juniors
known
respectively
as
githa
elgiva
and
ethelberta
they
met
in
school
and
in
the
playgrounds
but
with
a
few
exceptions
they
were
not
allowed
to
visit
each
other
houses
marjorie
and
dona
had
been
separated
on
their
arrival
the
former
being
entered
at
elgiva
and
the
latter
at
ethelberta
and
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
that
they
had
an
opportunity
of
meeting
and
comparing
notes
to
both
life
had
seemed
a
breathless
and
confusing
whirl
of
classes
meals
and
calisthenic
exercises
with
a
continual
ringing
of
bells
and
marching
from
one
room
to
another
it
was
a
comfort
at
last
to
have
half
an
hour
when
they
might
be
allowed
to
wander
about
and
do
as
they
pleased
let
scoot
into
that
little
wood
said
marjorie
seizing
dona
by
the
arm
it
looks
quiet
and
we
can
sit
down
and
talk
well
how
are
you
getting
on
like
it
so
far
dona
flung
herself
down
under
a
larch
tree
and
shook
her
head
tragically
i
hate
it
but
then
you
know
i
never
expected
to
like
it
you
should
see
my
you
should
just
see
mine
they
ca
be
as
bad
as
mine
i
guarantee
they
worse
but
go
on
and
tell
about
yours
there
mona
kenworthy
sighed
dona
she
looked
over
all
my
clothes
as
i
put
them
away
in
my
drawers
and
said
they
were
as
nice
as
hers
and
that
she
never
dream
of
wearing
a
camisole
unless
it
was
trimmed
with
real
lace
she
twists
her
hair
in
hinde
wavers
every
night
and
keeps
a
pot
of
complexion
cream
on
her
she
always
uses
stephanotis
scent
that
she
gets
from
one
special
place
in
london
and
it
costs
four
and
sixpence
a
bottle
she
hates
bacon
for
breakfast
and
she
has
seventeen
relations
at
the
front
she
thin
and
brown
and
her
nose
wiggles
like
a
rabbit
when
she
talks
i
should
mind
her
if
she
keep
to
her
own
cubicle
commented
marjorie
sylvia
page
will
overflow
into
mine
and
i
find
her
things
dumped
down
on
my
bed
she
nicer
than
irene
andrews
though
we
had
a
squabble
last
night
over
the
window
betty
moore
brought
a
whole
box
of
chocolates
with
her
and
she
ate
them
in
bed
and
never
offered
a
single
one
to
anybody
else
we
could
hear
her
crunching
for
ages
i
do
like
irene
but
i
agreed
with
her
that
betty
is
mean
nellie
mason
sleeps
in
the
next
cubicle
to
me
continued
dona
bent
on
retailing
her
own
woes
she
snores
dreadfully
and
it
kept
me
awake
though
she
not
so
bad
otherwise
beatrice
elliot
is
detestable
she
found
that
little
teddy
bear
i
brought
with
me
and
she
sniggered
and
asked
if
i
came
from
a
kindergarten
i
calculated
there
are
days
in
this
term
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
live
through
them
until
the
holidays
hallo
said
a
cheerful
voice
sitting
weeping
under
the
willows
are
you
new
girls
always
grouse
miss
broadway
sent
me
to
hunt
you
up
and
do
the
honours
of
the
premises
i
mollie
simpson
come
along
with
me
and
i
show
you
round
the
speaker
was
a
girl
of
about
sixteen
with
particularly
merry
blue
eyes
and
a
whimsical
expression
her
dark
curly
hair
was
plaited
and
tied
with
broad
ribbons
we
been
round
thanks
very
much
returned
marjorie
to
the
oh
but
that
does
count
if
you
only
gone
by
yourselves
you
would
notice
the
points
every
new
girl
has
got
to
be
personally
conducted
by
an
old
one
and
told
the
traditions
of
the
place
it
a
sort
of
initiation
you
know
we
a
regular
freemasons
code
here
of
things
you
may
do
or
must
quick
march
i
no
time
to
waste
tea
is
at
four
prompt
thus
urged
marjorie
and
dona
got
up
shook
the
pine
needles
from
their
dresses
and
followed
their
cicerone
who
seemed
determined
to
perform
her
office
of
guide
in
as
efficient
a
fashion
as
possible
this
is
the
quad
she
informed
them
that
the
assembly
hall
and
the
head
private
house
and
those
are
the
three
hostels
what
it
like
in
githa
i
ca
tell
you
because
i
never
been
there
it
for
seniors
and
no
intermediate
or
junior
may
pop
her
impertinent
nose
inside
or
so
much
as
go
and
peep
through
the
windows
without
getting
into
trouble
they
carpets
on
the
stairs
instead
of
linoleum
and
they
may
make
cocoa
in
their
bedrooms
and
fill
their
own
bags
and
other
privileges
that
are
allowed
to
us
luckless
individuals
they
may
come
and
see
us
by
special
permission
but
we
may
return
the
visits
by
the
by
you
oblige
me
greatly
if
you
tilt
your
chapeau
a
little
farther
forward
like
this
see
why
questioned
marjorie
greatly
astonished
as
she
made
the
required
alteration
to
the
angle
of
her
hat
because
only
seniors
may
wear
their
sailors
on
the
backs
of
their
heads
it
a
strict
point
of
school
etiquette
you
may
jam
on
your
hockey
cap
as
you
like
but
not
your
sailor
are
there
any
other
rules
asked
dona
heaps
intermediates
may
wear
bracelets
and
juniors
may
wear
lockets
they
limited
to
brooches
i
advise
you
to
strip
those
trinkets
off
at
once
and
stick
them
in
your
pockets
do
go
in
to
tea
with
them
on
any
account
how
silly
objected
dona
unclasping
her
locket
with
father
photo
in
it
most
unwillingly
now
look
here
young
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
good
advice
at
the
beginning
do
you
go
saying
anything
here
is
silly
the
rules
have
been
made
by
the
seniors
and
juniors
have
got
to
put
up
with
them
and
keep
civil
tongues
in
their
heads
if
you
want
to
get
on
you
have
to
accommodate
yourself
to
the
ways
of
the
place
any
girl
who
does
has
a
rough
time
i
warn
you
for
goodness
sake
do
begin
to
blub
do
be
a
dona
said
marjorie
impatiently
she
not
been
to
school
before
she
explained
to
mollie
so
she
still
feeling
rather
mollie
nodded
sympathetically
i
understand
she
soon
get
over
it
she
a
decent
kid
i
going
to
like
her
that
why
i
giving
her
all
these
tips
so
that
she
make
mistakes
and
begin
wrong
she
get
on
all
right
at
ethelberta
miss
jones
is
a
stunt
as
jinky
as
you
like
wish
we
had
her
at
our
house
who
is
the
head
of
st
elgiva
miss
norton
worse
luck
for
us
not
the
tall
fair
one
who
met
us
in
london
yesterday
the
same
oh
thunder
i
shall
never
get
on
with
her
i
know
the
acid
drop
a
rather
unsweetened
morsel
certainly
you
have
to
mind
your
p
and
q
she
can
be
decent
to
those
she
likes
but
she
does
take
to
everybody
she
has
taken
to
me
i
could
see
it
in
her
eye
at
euston
then
i
sorry
for
you
it
is
particularly
pleasant
to
be
in
bad
books
if
you
missed
your
train
and
kept
her
waiting
she
never
forgive
you
look
out
for
squalls
what
the
head
like
morrison
well
of
course
she
nice
but
we
stand
very
much
in
awe
of
her
it
a
terrible
thing
to
be
sent
down
to
her
study
we
generally
see
her
on
the
platform
we
call
her
empress
because
she
so
like
the
pictures
of
the
empress
eugénie
and
she
so
dignified
and
above
everybody
else
hallo
there
the
first
bell
we
must
scoot
and
wash
our
hands
if
you
late
for
a
meal
you
put
a
penny
in
the
missionary
box
marjorie
walked
into
the
large
with
mollie
simpson
she
felt
she
had
made
if
not
yet
a
friend
at
least
an
acquaintance
and
in
this
wilderness
of
fresh
faces
it
was
a
boon
to
be
able
to
speak
to
somebody
she
hoped
mollie
would
not
desert
her
and
sit
among
her
own
chums
the
girls
took
any
places
they
liked
for
tea
but
no
her
new
comrade
led
the
way
to
a
table
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
and
motioning
her
to
pass
first
took
the
next
chair
each
table
held
about
twenty
girls
and
a
mistress
sat
at
either
end
conversation
went
on
but
in
subdued
tones
and
any
unduly
lifted
voices
met
with
instant
reproof
i
always
try
to
sit
in
the
middle
unless
i
can
get
near
a
mistress
i
like
volunteered
mollie
that
one
with
the
ripply
hair
is
miss
duckworth
she
rather
sweet
is
she
we
call
her
ducky
for
short
the
other
miss
carter
the
botany
teacher
oh
i
say
here
the
acid
drop
coming
to
the
next
table
i
did
bargain
to
have
her
so
near
marjorie
turned
to
look
and
in
so
doing
her
sleeve
most
unfortunately
caught
the
edge
of
her
cup
with
the
result
that
a
stream
of
tea
emptied
itself
over
the
clean
miss
norton
who
was
just
passing
to
her
place
noticed
the
accident
and
murmured
how
careless
then
paused
as
if
remembering
something
and
said
marjorie
anderson
you
are
to
report
yourself
in
my
study
at
very
subdued
and
crestfallen
marjorie
handed
her
cup
to
be
refilled
miss
duckworth
made
no
remark
but
the
girls
in
her
vicinity
glared
at
the
mess
on
the
cloth
mollie
pulled
an
expressive
face
now
you
in
for
it
she
remarked
the
acid
drop
going
to
treat
you
to
some
what
have
you
been
doing
spilling
my
tea
i
suppose
grunted
marjorie
that
not
norty
business
for
it
did
happen
at
her
table
you
would
have
to
report
yourself
for
that
it
must
be
something
else
then
i
sure
i
do
know
marjorie
tone
was
defiant
and
you
do
care
oh
that
all
very
well
wait
till
you
had
five
minutes
with
the
acid
drop
and
you
sing
a
different
song
although
marjorie
might
affect
nonchalance
before
her
schoolfellows
her
heart
thumped
in
a
very
unpleasant
fashion
as
she
tapped
at
the
door
of
miss
norton
study
the
teacher
sat
at
a
bureau
writing
she
looked
up
and
readjusted
her
as
her
pupil
entered
marjorie
anderson
she
began
i
inspected
your
cubicle
this
afternoon
and
found
this
book
inside
one
of
your
drawers
are
you
aware
that
you
have
broken
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
you
may
borrow
books
from
the
library
but
you
are
not
allowed
to
have
any
private
books
at
all
in
your
possession
with
the
exception
of
a
bible
and
a
prayer
book
miss
norton
held
in
her
hand
the
sensational
novel
which
marjorie
had
bought
while
waiting
for
the
train
at
rosebury
the
girl
jumped
guiltily
at
the
sight
of
it
she
had
only
read
a
few
pages
of
it
and
had
completely
forgotten
its
existence
she
remembered
now
that
among
the
rules
sent
by
the
head
mistress
and
read
to
her
by
her
mother
the
bringing
back
of
fiction
to
school
had
been
strictly
prohibited
as
she
had
no
excuse
to
offer
she
merely
looked
uncomfortable
and
said
nothing
miss
norton
eyed
her
keenly
you
will
find
the
rules
at
brackenfield
are
intended
to
be
kept
she
remarked
as
this
is
a
first
offence
i
allow
it
to
pass
but
girls
have
been
expelled
from
this
school
for
bringing
in
unsuitable
literature
you
had
better
be
careful

the
talents
tournament
by
the
time
marjorie
had
been
a
fortnight
at
brackenfield
she
had
already
caught
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
considered
herself
a
member
of
the
community
in
the
brief
space
of
two
weeks
she
had
learnt
many
things
first
and
foremost
that
hilton
house
had
been
a
mere
kindergarten
in
comparison
with
the
big
busy
world
in
which
she
now
moved
and
that
all
her
standards
required
readjusting
instead
of
being
an
elder
pupil
with
a
considerable
voice
in
the
arrangement
of
affairs
she
was
now
only
an
intermediate
under
the
absolute
authority
of
seniors
a
unit
in
a
large
army
of
girls
and
except
from
her
own
point
of
view
of
no
very
great
importance
if
she
wished
to
make
any
reputation
for
herself
her
claims
must
rest
upon
whether
or
not
she
could
prove
herself
an
asset
to
the
school
either
by
obtaining
a
high
place
in
her
form
or
winning
distinction
in
the
or
among
the
various
guilds
and
societies
marjorie
was
decidedly
ambitious
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
gain
honours
and
to
have
her
name
recorded
in
the
school
magazine
dazzling
dreams
danced
before
her
of
tennis
or
cricket
colours
of
solos
in
concerts
or
leading
parts
in
dramatic
recitals
of
heading
examination
lists
and
who
knew
of
a
possible
prefectship
some
time
in
the
far
future
meanwhile
if
she
wished
to
attain
to
any
of
these
desirable
objects
work
with
a
capital
w
must
be
her
motto
she
had
been
placed
in
iva
and
though
most
of
the
subjects
were
within
her
powers
it
needed
all
the
concentration
of
which
she
was
capable
to
keep
even
a
moderate
position
in
the
weekly
lists
miss
duckworth
her
form
mistress
had
no
tolerance
for
slackers
she
was
a
breezy
cheery
interesting
personality
an
inspiring
teacher
and
excellent
at
games
taking
a
prominent
part
in
all
matches
or
tournaments
mistresses
versus
pupils
miss
duckworth
was
immensely
popular
amongst
her
girls
it
was
the
fashion
to
admire
her
i
think
the
shape
of
her
nose
is
just
perfect
declared
francie
sheppard
and
i
like
that
rossetti
mouth
although
some
people
might
say
it
too
big
i
wish
i
had
auburn
hair
i
wonder
if
it
ripples
naturally
or
if
she
does
it
up
in
wavers
speculated
elsie
bartlett
it
must
be
ever
so
long
when
it
down
annie
turner
saw
her
once
in
her
and
said
that
her
hair
reached
to
her
knees
but
annie
always
exaggerates
put
in

you
may
take
half
a
yard
off

any
day
i
think

sport
agreed
laura
norris
the
girls
were
lounging
in
various
attitudes
of
comfort
round
the
fire
in
their
at
elgiva
in
that
blissful
interval
between
preparation
and
supper
when
nothing
very
intellectual
was
expected
from
them
and
they
might
amuse
themselves
as
they
wished
irene
squatting
on
the
rug

armed
with

kept
poking

luxuriated
in

to
herself
while
francie
and
sylvia
a
tight
fit
shared
the
big
in
a
corner
three
chums
were
coaching
each
other
in
the
speeches
for
a
play
and
a
group
collected
round
the
piano
were
trying
the
chorus
of
a
new
popular
song
go
it
patricia
called
irene
to
the
girl
who
was
playing
the
accompaniment
you
did
that

trot
out

by
all

take
the
house
by

what
going
to
happen
night
enquired
marjorie
who
having
changed
her
dress
for
supper
now
came
into
the
room
and
joined
the
circle
by
the
fire
a
very
important
event
my
good
child
vouchsafed
francie
sheppard
an
event
upon
which
you
might
almost
say
all
the
rest
of
the
school
year
hangs
we
call
it
the
talents
tournament
the
what
i
wish
you
would
ask
so
many
questions
i
was
just
going
to
explain
if
you
give
me
time
the
whole
school
meets
in
the
assembly
hall
and
anybody
who
feels
she
can
do
anything
may
give
us
a
specimen
of
her
talents
and
if
she
passes
muster
she
allowed
to
join
one
of
the
societies
the
dramatic
or
the
part
singing
or
the
orchestra
or
the
french
conversational
or
she
may
exhibit
specimens
if
she
wants
to
enter
the
natural
history
or
scientific
or
show
some
of
her
drawings
if
she
artistic
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
nothing
at
all
i
hate
showing
off
i
no
tricks
either
yawned
laura
i
shall
help
to
form
the
audience
and
do
the
clapping
that
the
rôle
i
best
at
old
mollie
put
you
up
to
tips
if
you
yearning
to
go
on
the
platform
suggested
elsie
she
a
at
recitations
reels
them
off
no
end
i
can
tell
you
you
need
hang
your
head
mollums
like
a
modest
violet
it
a
solid
fact
you
the
ornament
of
elgiva
when
it
comes
to
saying
pieces
have
you
got
anything
fresh
by
the
way
for
night
well
i
did
learn
something
new
during
the
holidays
confessed
mollie
i
hope
you
like
it
it
rather
funny
i
hear
there
to
be
a
new
society
this
term
meg
hutchinson
was
telling
me
about
it
oh
i
know
the
interrupted
francie
and
a
jolly
good
idea
too
it
is
everybody
who
has
time
to
swat
at
learning
parts
for
the
dramatic
besides
some
girls
can
do
rehearsed
acting
well
and
are
no
good
at
impromptu
things
and
vice
versa
they
want
sorting
out
i
do
understand
said
marjorie
oh
bother
you
you
always
wanting
explanations
well
of
course
you
know
we
have
a
dramatic
society
that
gets
up
quite
elaborate
plays
the
members
spend
ages
practising
their
speeches
and
studying
their
attitudes
before
the
and
they
have
gorgeous
costumes
made
for
them
and
scenery
and
all
the
rest
of
it
a
really
business
some
of
the
prefects
thought
that
it
was
rather
too
formal
an
affair
and
suggested
another
society
for
impromptu
acting
nothing
is
to
be
prepared
beforehand
morrison
is
to
give
a
word
for
a
charade
and
the
members
are
allowed
two
minutes
to
talk
it
over
and
must
act
it
right
away
with
any
costumes
they
can
fling
on
out
of
the
box
they
be
arranged
in
teams
and
may
each
have
five
minutes
for
a
performance
i
expect
it
will
be
a
scream
are
you
fond
of
acting
marjorie
asked
mollie
i
just
love
it
then
put
down
your
name
for
the
charades
tournament
we
have
got
a
great
number
of
volunteers
from
elgiva
yet
most
of
the
girls
seem
to
funk
it
elsie
are
you
going
to
try
elsie
shook
her
curls
regretfully
i
like
to
but
i
know
every
idea
i
have
would
desert
me
directly
i
faced
an
audience
i
all
right
with
a
definite
part
that
i
got
into
my
head
but
i
ca
make
up
as
i
go
along
and
it
no
use
asking
me
i
only
bungle
and
stammer
and
make
an
utter
goose
of
myself
and
spoil
the
whole
thing
hallo
there
the
supper
bell
come
along
marjorie
followed
the
others
in
to
supper
with
a
feeling
of
exhilaration
she
was
immensely
attracted
by
the
idea
of
the
talents
tournament
so
far
as
a
new
girl
she
had
been
little
noticed
and
had
had
no
opportunity
of
showing
what
she
could
do
she
had
received
a
hint
from
mollie
on
her
first
day
that
new
girls
who
pushed
themselves
forward
would
probably
be
met
with
snubs
so
she
had
not
tried
the
piano
in
the
or
given
any
exhibition
of
her
capabilities
unasked
this
however
would
be
a
legitimate
occasion
and
nobody
could
accuse
her
of
trying
to
show
off
by
merely
entering
her
name
in
the
charades
competition
i
wish
dona
would
play
her
violin
and
have
a
shy
for
the
school
orchestra
she
thought
i
speak
to
her
if
i
can
catch
her
after
supper
it
was
difficult
for
the
sisters
to
find
any
time
for
private
talk
but
by
dodging
about
the
passage
marjorie
managed
to
waylay
dona
before
the
latter
disappeared
into
ethelberta
and
propounded
her
suggestion
oh
i
could
replied
dona
in
horror
go
on
the
platform
and
play
a
piece
i
die
please
do
ask
me
to
do
anything
so
dreadful
i
want
to
join
the
orchestra
oh
well
yes
i
go
in
for
the
drawing
competition
if
you
like
but
i
not
keen
i
do
care
about
all
these
societies
my
lessons
are
quite
bad
enough
i
made
friends
with
ailsa
donald
and
we
have
lovely
times
all
to
ourselves
we
making
scrap
albums
for
the
hospital
miss
jones
has
given
us
all
her
old
christmas
cards
she
adorable
i
say
i
must
go
or
i
shall
be
late
for
our
call
over
the
talents
tournament
was
really
a
very
important
event
in
the
school
year
for
upon
its
results
would
depend
the
placing
of
the
various
competitors
in
certain
coveted
offices
it
was
esteemed
a
great
privilege
to
be
asked
to
join
the
orchestra
and
to
be
included
in
the
committee
of
the
dramatic
marked
a
girl
name
with
a
lucky
star
on
the
saturday
evening
in
question
the
whole
school
in
party
dresses
met
in
the
big
assembly
hall
it
was
a
conventional
occasion
and
they
were
received
by
morrison
and
the
teachers
and
responded
with
an
elaborate
politeness
that
was
the
cult
of
the
college
for
the
space
of
three
hours
an
extremely
atmosphere
prevailed
not
a
word
of
slang
offended
the
ear
and
everybody
behaved
with
the
dignity
and
courtesy
demanded
by
such
a
stately
ceremony
morrison
in
black
silk
and
old
lace
her
white
hair
dressed
high
was
an
imposing
figure
and
set
a
standard
of
cultured
deportment
that
was
copied
by
every
girl
in
the
room
the
brackenfielders
prided
themselves
upon
their
manners
and
though
they
might
relapse
in
the
playground
or
dormitory
no
court
etiquette
could
be
stricter
than
their
code
for
public
occasions
the
hall
was
quite
it
had
been
charmingly
decorated
by
the
seniors
with
autumn
leaves
and
bunches
of
chrysanthemums
and
michaelmas
daisies
a
grand
piano
and
pots
of
palms
stood
on
the
platform
and
the
best
school
banner
ornamented
the
wall
it
all
looked
so
festive
that
marjorie
who
had
been
rather
dreading
the
gathering
cheered
up
and
began
to
anticipate
a
pleasant
evening
she
shook
hands
composedly
with
the
empress
and
ran
the
gauntlet
of
greetings
with
the
other
mistresses
with
equal
credit
not
an
altogether
easy
ordeal
under
the
watching
eyes
of
her
companions
this
preliminary
ceremony
being
finished
she
thankfully
slipped
into
a
seat
and
waited
for
the
business
part
of
the
tournament
to
begin
the
reception
of
the
whole
school
lasted
some
time
and
the
hand
must
have
ached
her
mental
notes
as
to
the
quality
of
the
handshakes
she
received
would
be
publicly
recorded
next
day
from
the
platform
with
special
condemnation
for
the
limp
fishy
or
variety
on
the
one
side
or
the
agonizing
on
the
other
miss
thomas
one
of
the
music
mistresses
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
the
proceedings
opened
with
a
competition
ten
girls
in
more
or
less
acute
stages
of
nervousness
each
in
turn
played
a
study
their
points
for
which
were
carefully
recorded
by
the
judges
marks
being
given
for
tone
bowing
time
tune
and
artistic
rendering
as
they
retired
to
put
away
their
instruments
their
places
were
taken
by
vocal
candidates
in
order
to
shorten
the
programme
each
was
allowed
to
sing
only
one
verse
of
a
song
and
their
merits
or
faults
were
similarly
recorded
several
of
the
intermediates
had
entered
for
the
competition
rose

trilled
forth
a
sentimental
little
ditty
in
a
rather
quavering
mezzo
annie
turner
whose
compass
was
contralto
poured
out
a
sea
ballad
a
trifle
flat
nora
cleary
raised
a
storm
of
applause
by
a
funny
irish
song
and
received
marks
for
style
though
her
voice
was
poor
in
quality
and
elsie
bartlett
scored
for
elgiva
by
reaching
high

with
the
utmost
clearness
and
ease
the
intermediates
grinned
at
one
another
with
satisfaction
even
gladys

the
acknowledged
prima
donna
of
githa
had
never
soared
in
public
beyond
a
sharp
they
felt
that
they
had
beaten
the
seniors
by
half
a
tone
piano
solos
were
next
on
the
list
limited
to
two
pages
on
account
of
the
too
speedy
passage
of
time
here
again
the
elgiva
girls
expected
a
triumph
for
patricia
lennox
was
to
play
a
waltz
especially
composed
in
her
honour
by
a
musical
friend
it
was
called
under
the
stars
and
bore
a
coloured
picture
of
a
sky
water
and
trees
and
a
stone
balustrade
and
it
bore
printed
upon
it
the
magic
words
dedicated
to
patricia
and
underneath
written
in
a
firm
manly
hand
with
kindest
remembrances
from
the
whole
of
elgiva
had
thrilled
when
allowed
to
view
the
copy
exhibited
by
its
owner
with
many
becoming
blushes
but
with
steadfast
refusals
to
record
tender
particulars
and
though
patricia
enemies
were
unkind
enough
to
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
patricia
mentioned
on
the
cover
was
identical
with
herself
or
that
the
stood
for
edwin
herbert
the
composer
it
was
felt
that
they
merely
objected
out
of
envy
and
would
have
been
only
too
delighted
to
have
such
luck
themselves
they
all
listened
entranced
as
patricia
dashed
off
her
piece
she
had
a
showy
execution
and
it
really
sounded
very
well
the
whole
school
knew
about
the
dedication
and
the
inscription
the
intermediates
had
taken
care
of
that
as
their
champion
descended
from
the
platform
they
felt
that
she
had
invested
elgiva
with
an
element
of
mystery
and
romance
but
alas
one
story
is
good
until
another
is
told
and
githa
had
been
reserving
a
trump
card
for
the
occasion
winifrede
mason
had
herself
composed
a
piece
she
called
it
the
brackenfield
march
and
had
written
it
out
in
manuscript
and
drawn
a
picture
of
the
school
in
bold
upon
a
brown
paper
cover
it
was
quite
a
jolly
catchy
tune
with
plenty
of
swing
and
go
about
it
and
the
fact
that
it
was
undoubtedly
her
own
production
caused
poor
patricia
waltz
to
pale
before
it
the
clapping
was
tremendous
every
girl
in
school
with
the
exception
of
nine
who
had
not
studied
the
piano
was
determined
to
copy
the
march
and
learn
it
for
herself
and
winifrede
was
immediately
besieged
with
applications
for
the
loan
of
the
manuscript
she
bore
her
honours
calmly
oh
it
was
difficult
i
just
knocked
it
off
you
know
i
heaps
of
tunes
in
my
head
it
only
a
matter
of
getting
them
written
down
really
when
i
time
i
try
to
make
up
another
oh
i
do
know
about
publishing
it
that
can
wait
to
live
in
the
same
school
with
a
girl
who
composed
pieces
was
something
everybody
anticipated
the
publication
of
the
march
and
felt
that
the
reputation
of
brackenfield
would
be
thoroughly
established
in
the
musical
world
the
next
item
on
the
programme
was
an
interval
for
refreshments
during
which
time
various
exhibits
of
drawings
and
of
scientific
and
natural
history
specimens
were
on
view
and
were
judged
according
to
merit
by
miss
carter
and
miss
hughlins
the
second
part
of
the
evening
was
to
be
dramatic
a
good
many
names
had
been
given
in
for
the
charades
competition
and
these
were
arranged
in
groups
of
four
each
company
was
given
one
syllable
of
a
charade
to
act
with
a
strict
time
limit
a
large
assortment
of
clothes
and
some
useful
articles
of
furniture
were
placed
in
the
behind
the
platform
and
the
actresses
were
allowed
only
two
minutes
to
arrange
their
stage
don
costumes
and
discuss
their
piece
marjorie
found
herself
drawn
with
annie
turner
belle
miller
and
violet
nelson
two
of
the
juniors
the
syllable
to
be
acted
was
age
and
the
four
girls
withdrew
to
the
for
a
hasty
conference
what
can
we
do
i
have
an
idea
in
my
head
sighed
annie
two
minutes
is
not
enough
to
think
the
juniors
said
nothing
but
giggled
nervously
marjorie
ready
wits
however
rose
to
the
emergency
we
have
a
red
cross
hospital
she
decided
you
annie
are
the
commandant
and
we
three
are
prospective
coming
to
be
interviewed
you
got
to
ask
us
our
names
and
ages
and
a
heap
of
other
questions
put
on
that
red
cross
apron
quick
and
we
put
on
hats
and
coats
and
pretend
we
had
a
long
journey
belle
take
in
a
table
and
a
chair
for
the
commandant
she
ought
to
be
sitting
writing
annie
belle
and
violet
seized
on
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
and
robed
themselves
immediately
when
the
bell
rang
the
performers
marched
on
to
the
platform
without
any
delay
which
secured
ten
marks
for
promptitude
annie
in
her
red
cross
apron
rapped
the
table
in
an
authoritative
fashion
and
demanded
the
business
of
her
callers
then
the
fun
began
marjorie
posing
as
a
wild
irish
girl
put
on
a
capital
imitation
of
the
brogue
and
urged
her
own
merits
with
zeal
she
evaded
the
question
of
her
right
age
and
offered
a
whole
catalogue
of
things
she
could
do
from
dressing
a
wound
to
mixing
a
pudding
and
scrubbing
the
passages
she
was
so
racy
and
humorous
and
threw
in
such
amusing
asides
that
the
audience
shrieked
with
laughter
and
were
quite
disappointed
when
the
five
minutes
bell
put
a
sudden
and
speedy
end
to
the
interesting
performance
as
marjorie
walked
back
to
her
seat
she
became
well
aware
that
she
had
scored
her
fellow
intermediates
looked
at
her
with
a
new
interest
for
she
had
brought
credit
to
elgiva
is
she
a
scream
she
overheard
rose
butler
say
to
francie
sheppard
and
francie
replied
rather
i
call
her
topping
which
of
course
was
slang
and
not
fit
for
such
an
occasion
but
then
the
girls
were
beginning
to
forget
the
elaborate
ceremony
of
the
opening
of
the
evening
next
day
after
morning
school
was
over
jean
everard
one
of
the
prefects
tapped
marjorie
on
the
shoulder
we
put
your
name
down
for
the
charades
society
she
said
briefly
i
suppose
you
want
to
join
rather
replied
marjorie
flushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
with
delight
at
the
honour
offered
her
chapter
iv
exeats
marjorie
and
dona
possessed
one
immense
advantage
in
their
choice
of
a
school
their
aunt
trafford
lived
within
a
mile
of
brackenfield
and
had
arranged
with
morrison
that
the
two
girls
should
spend
every
alternate
wednesday
afternoon
at
her
house
wednesday
was
the
most
general
day
for
exeats
it
was
the
leisurely
of
the
week
when
the
girls
might
carry
out
their
own
little
plans
saturday
afternoons
being
reserved
for
hockey
practice
and
matches
at
which
all
were
expected
to
attend
the
rules
were
strict
at
brackenfield
and
enacted
that
the
girls
must
be
escorted
from
school
to
their
destination
and
sent
back
under
proper
chaperonage
but
during
the
hours
spent
at
their
aunt
they
were
considered
to
be
under
her
charge
and
might
go
where
she
allowed
to
the
sisters
these
fortnightly
outings
marked
the
term
with
white
stones
they
looked
forward
to
them
immensely
both
chafed
a
little
at
the
strict
discipline
and
confinement
of
brackenfield
it
was
first
experience
of
school
and
marjorie
had
been
accustomed
to
a
much
easier
régime
at
hilton
house
it
was
nice
also
to
have
a
few
hours
in
which
they
could
be
together
and
talk
over
their
own
affairs
there
were
home
letters
to
be
discussed
news
of
bevis
on
board
of
leonard
in
the
trenches
and
larry
in
the
hurried
scrawls
from
father
looking
after
commissariat
business
somewhere
in
france
accounts
of
nora
new
housekeeping
picture
post
cards
from
peter
and
cyril
brief
laborious
epistles
from
joan
and
delightful
chatty
notes
from
mother
who
sent
a
kind
of
family
chronicle
round
to
the
absent
members
of
her
flock
one
wednesday
afternoon
about
the
middle
of
october
found
marjorie
and
dona
walking
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
whitecliffe
they
were
policed
by
miss
norton
who
was
taking
a
detachment
of
into
the
town
so
that
at
present
the
company
walked
in
a
crocodile
which
however
would
soon
split
up
and
distribute
its
various
members
it
was
a
lovely
fresh
autumn
day
and
the
girls
stepped
along
briskly
they
wore
their
school
hats
and
badges
with
the
brown
white
and
blue
ribbons
and
the
regulation
exeat
uniform
brown
harris
tweed
skirts
and
knitted
sports
coats
nobody
could
mistake
us
for
any
other
school
said
marjorie
i
feel
i
as
much
labelled
as
a
dartmoor
prisoner
is
known
by
his
black
arrows
it
makes
one
rather
conspicuous
trust
the
empress
for
that
laughed
mollie
simpson
who
was
one
of
the
party
you
see
there
are
other
schools
at
whitecliffe
and
other
girls
go
into
the
town
too
sometimes
they
rather
giggly
and
silly
and
we
certainly
do
want
to
get
the
credit
for
their
escapades
everybody
knows
a
at
a
glance
so
there
no
risk
of
false
reports
the
empress
prides
herself
on
our
clear
record
we
the
reputation
of
behaving
beautifully
we
have
much
chance
of
doing
anything
else
said
marjorie
looking
rather
ruefully
in
the
direction
of
miss
norton
who
brought
up
the
rear
at
the
the
andersons
found
their
cousin
elaine
waiting
for
them
and
were
handed
over
into
her
charge
by
their
teacher
with
strict
injunctions
that
they
were
to
be
escorted
back
to
their
respective
hostels
by
marjorie
waved
to
mollie
and
the
school
crocodile
passed
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
whitecliffe
when
the
last
hat
had
bobbed
round
the
corner
and
the
shadow
of
miss
norton
presence
was
really
removed
for
the
space
of
four
whole
hours
the
two
girls
each
seized
elaine
by
one
of
her
hands
and
twirled
her
round
in
a
wild
jig
of
triumph
elaine
was
nearly
twenty
old
enough
to
just
pass
muster
as
an
escort
in
the
eyes
of
miss
norton
but
young
enough
to
be
still
almost
a
schoolgirl
at
heart
and
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
afternoons
of
her
cousins
visits
she
worked
as
a
at
the
red
cross
hospital
but
she
was
generally
off
duty
by
two
and
able
to
devote
herself
to
their
amusement
she
had
come
now
straight
from
the
hospital
and
was
in
uniform
you
promised
to
take
us
to
see
the
tommies
said
marjorie
as
elaine
turned
down
the
side
road
and
led
the
way
towards
home
the
commandant
did
want
me
to
bring
visitors
there
a
little
whitewashing
and
papering
going
on
and
the
place
is
in
rather
a
mess
you
shall
come
another
time
when
we
all
decorated
and
in
order
besides
we
have
many
soldiers
this
week
we
sent
away
a
batch
of
convalescents
last
thursday
and
we
expecting
a
fresh
contingent
in
any
day
that
why
we
taking
the
opportunity
to
have
a
special
cleaning
i
wish
i
were
old
enough
to
be
a
sighed
marjorie
i
love
it
better
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
it
my
dream
at
present
i
enjoy
it
thoroughly
said
elaine
though
of
course
there
plenty
to
do
and
sometimes
the
commandant
gets
ratty
over
just
nothing
at
all
have
you
john
ambulance
classes
at
school
they
going
to
start
next
month
and
i
mean
to
join
i
put
my
name
down
and
dona
too
they
not
for
juniors
we
have
a
first
aid
instruction
class
of
our
own
explained
dona
but
i
hate
it
because
they
always
make
me
be
the
patient
as
i
a
new
girl
and
i
do
like
being
bandaged
and
walked
about
after
poisons
and
restored
from
drowning
and
all
the
rest
of
it
it
rather
a
painful
process
to
have
your
tongue
pulled
out
and
your
arms
jerked
up
and
down
poor
old
girl
perhaps
another
victim
will
arrive
at
and
take
your
place
then
you
have
the
satisfaction
of
performing
all
those
operations
upon
her
i
been
through
the
same
mill
myself
once
upon
a
time
the
traffords
house
the
tamarisks
stood
on
cliff
walks
a
pleasant
residential
quarter
somewhat
away
from
the
visitors
portion
of
the
town
with
its
promenade
and
there
was
a
beautiful
view
over
the
sea
where
little
white
caps
were
breaking
and
small
vessels
bobbing
about
in
a
manner
calculated
to
test
the
good
seamanship
of
any
tourists
who
had
ventured
forth
in
them
aunt
ellinor
was
in
the
town
at
a
food
control
committee
meeting
so
elaine
for
the
present
was
sole
hostess
what
shall
we
do
she
asked
you
may
choose
anything
you
like
the
cinema
and
tea
at
a
café
afterwards
or
a
last
game
of
tennis
the
lawn
will
just
stand
it
or
shall
we
go
for
a
scramble
on
the
cliffs
votes
please
without
any
hesitation
dona
and
marjorie
plumped
for
the
cliffs
they
loved
walking
and
as
their
own
home
was
inland
the
seaside
held
attractions
elaine
hastily
changed
into
tweed
skirt
and
sports
coat
found
a
favourite
stick
and
declared
herself
ready
and
the
three
in
very
cheerful
spirits
set
out
along
the
hillside
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
sunny
october
days
when
autumn
seems
to
have
borrowed
from
summer
and
the
air
is
as
warm
and
balmy
as
june
great
flocks
of
wheeled
screaming
round
the
cliffs
their
wings
flashing
in
the
sunshine
red
admiral
and
butterflies
still
fluttered
over
late
specimens
of
flowers
and
the
bracken
was
brown
and
golden
underfoot
the
girls
were
wild
with
the
delight
of
a
few
hours
emancipation
from
school
rules
and
flew
about
gathering
belated
harebells
and
running
to
the
top
of
any
little
eminence
to
get
the
view
after
about
a
mile
on
the
hills
they
dipped
down
a
steep
sandy
path
that
led
to
the
shore
they
found
themselves
in
a
delightful
cove
with
rugged
rocks
on
either
side
and
a
belt
of
hard
firm
sand
the
tide
was
fairly
well
out
so
they
followed
the
retreating
waves
to
the
water
edge
a
recent
stormy
day
had
flung
up
great
masses
of
seaweed
and
hundreds
of
dona
whose
tastes
had
just
begun
to
awaken
in
the
direction
of
natural
history
poked
about
with
great
enjoyment
collecting
specimens
there
were
shells
to
be
had
on
the
sand
and
mermaids
purses
and
bunches
of
whelks
eggs
and
lovely
little
stones
that
looked
capable
of
being
polished
on
the
lapidary
wheel
which
miss
jones
had
set
up
in
the
for
lack
of
a
basket
dona
filled
her
own
handkerchief
and
commandeered
marjorie
for
the
same
purpose
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
left
home
she
looked
perfectly
happy
dona
tastes
were
always
quiet
she
did
not
like
hockey
practices
or
any
very
energetic
games
she
did
not
care
about
mixing
with
the
common
herd
of
her
schoolfellows
and
much
preferred
the
society
of
one
or
at
most
two
friends
to
live
in
the
depths
of
the
country
was
her
ideal
marjorie
on
the
contrary
liked
the
bustle
of
life
while
dona
investigated
the
clumps
of
seaweed
she
plied
elaine
with
questions
about
the
hospital
marjorie
was
intensely
patriotic
she
followed
every
event
of
the
war
keenly
and
was
thrilled
by
the
experiences
of
her
soldier
father
and
brothers
she
was
burning
to
do
something
to
help
to
nurse
the
wounded
drive
a
transport
wagon
act
as
secretary
to
a
or
even
be
telephone
operator
over
in
france
anything
that
would
be
of
service
to
her
country
and
allow
her
to
feel
that
she
had
played
her
part
however
small
in
the
conduct
of
the
great
war
as
she
watched
the
sea
she
thought
not
so
much
of
its
natural
history
treasures
as
of
submarines
and
floating
mines
and
her
heart
went
out
to
bevis
somewhere
on
deep
waters
keeping
watchful
guard
against
the
enemy
it
was
so
delightful
in
the
cove
that
the
girls
were
loath
to
go
they
climbed
with
reluctance
up
the
steep
sandy
little
path
to
the
cliff
as
they
neared
the
top
they
could
hear
voices
in
altercation
a
protesting
childish
wail
and
a
blunt
uncompromising
scolding
retort
on
the
road
above
stood
an
invalid
carriage
piled
up
with
innumerable
parcels
and
containing
also
a
small
boy
he
was
a
charmingly
pretty
little
fellow
with
a
very
pale
delicately
oval
face
beautiful
pathetic
brown
eyes
and
rich
golden
hair
that
fell
in
curls
over
his
shoulders
like
a
girl
he
was
peering
out
from
amidst
the
host
of
packages
and
trying
to
look
back
along
the
road
and
evidently
arguing
some
point
with
the
utmost
persistence
the
untidy
servant
girl
who
wheeled
the
carriage
had
stopped
and
gave
a
heated
reply
it
no
use
i
tell
you
goodness
knows
where
you
may
have
dropped
it
and
if
you
think
i
going
to
traipse
back
you
much
mistaken
late
as
it
is
and
a
pretty
there
be
when
i
get
in
it
your
own
fault
for
not
taking
better
care
of
it
have
you
lost
anything
enquired
elaine
as
the
girls
entered
the
road
in
the
midst
of
the
quarrel
it
his
book
answered
the
servant
he
dropped
it
out
of
the
pram
somewhere
on
the
way
from
whitecliffe
but
i
ca
go
back
for
it
too
far
and
we
got
to
be
getting
home
what
kind
of
a
book
was
it
asked
marjorie
fairy
tales
have
you
found
it
said
the
child
eagerly
all
about
rumpelstiltzkin
and
goose
girl
and
seven
princesses
we
have
found
it
but
we
look
for
it
on
our
way
back
have
you
any
idea
where
you
dropped
it
the
little
boy
shook
his
head
i
was
reading
it
in
the
town
while
lizzie
went
inside
the
shops
then
i
forgot
about
it
till
just
now
oh
i
know
what
happened
when
the
prince
went
to
see
the
old
witch
his
brown
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
the
corners
of
the
pretty
mouth
twitched
he
such
a
child
for
reading
at
it
all
day
long
explained
the
servant
he
thinks
as
much
of
an
old
book
as
some
of
us
would
of
golden
sovereigns
well
we
must
be
getting
on
eric
i
ca
stop
look
here
said
dona
we
hunt
for
the
book
on
our
way
back
to
whitecliffe
if
we
find
it
we
meet
you
here
fortnight
at
the
same
time
and
give
it
to
you
and
suppose
you
do
find
it
quavered
the
little
boy
anxiously
i
think
the
fairies
will
bring
it
to
us
somehow
you
come
here
fortnight
and
see
cheer
oh
do
cry
he
wants
his
tea
said
the
servant
hold
on
to
those
parcels
eric
or
we
shall
be
dropping
something
else
the
little
boy
put
his
arms
round
several
packages
and
tried
to
wave
a
to
the
girls
as
his
attendant
wheeled
him
away
poor
wee
chap
i
wonder
what
the
matter
with
him
said
elaine
when
the
long
perambulator
had
turned
the
corner
and
i
wonder
where
he
can
possibly
be
going
there
are
no
houses
that
way
only
a
wretched
little
village
with
a
few
cottages
i
ca
place
him
at
all
replied
marjorie
he
not
a
poor
child
and
he
not
exactly
a
gentleman
the
carriage
was
very
shabby
with
such
an
old
rug
and
the
girl
was
tidy
enough
for
a
nurse
she
looked
like
a
general
slavey
dona
i
do
believe
you
find
that
book
i
do
suppose
i
shall
returned
dona
but
i
have
fairy
at
home
and
i
thought
i
write
to
mother
and
ask
her
to
send
it
to
auntie
for
me
then
i
could
take
it
to
him
next
exeat
oh
good
what
a
splendid
idea
though
the
girls
kept
a
careful
along
the
road
they
came
across
no
volume
either
someone
else
had
picked
it
up
or
it
had
perhaps
been
dropped
in
the
street
at
whitecliffe
dona
wrote
home
accordingly
and
received
the
reply
that
her
mother
would
post
the
book
to
the
tamarisks
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
sisters
watched
the
weather
anxiously
when
their
fortnightly
exeat
came
round
they
were
fascinated
with
little
eric
and
wanted
to
see
him
again
they
could
not
forget
his
pale
wistful
face
among
the
parcels
in
the
long
perambulator
luckily
their
holiday
afternoon
was
fine
so
they
were
allowed
to
go
to
their
aunt
under
the
escort
of
two
prefects
they
found
elaine
ready
to
start
and
much
interested
in
the
errand
the
book
came
a
week
ago
she
informed
dona
i
expect
your
young
man
will
be
waiting
at
the
tryst
he
not
due
till
four
if
he
keeps
the
appointment
exactly
laughed
dona
but
i
brought
a
basket
so
let
go
now
to
the
cove
and
get
specimens
while
we
waiting
if
the
girls
were
early
at
the
the
little
boy
was
earlier
still
the
long
perambulator
was
standing
by
the
roadside
when
they
reached
the
path
to
the
cove
lizzie
the
servant
girl
greeted
them
with
enthusiasm
why
here
you
are
she
cried
i
never
expected
you
come
and
i
told
eric
so
i
said
it
was
in
reason
you
remember
and
he
only
be
disappointed
but
he
thought
of
nothing
else
all
this
fortnight
been
ill
again
and
he
should
really
be
out
because
the
pram
jolts
him
but
i
got
to
go
to
whitecliffe
and
he
worried
so
to
come
that
his
ma
said
put
on
his
things
and
take
him
he
cry
himself
sick
if
he
left
the
little
pale
face
was
whiter
even
than
before
there
were
large
dark
rings
round
the
brown
eyes
and
the
golden
hair
curled
limply
eric
did
not
speak
but
he
looked
with
a
world
of
wistfulness
at
the
parcel
in
dona
hand
i
could
find
your
book
but
i
brought
you
mine
instead
and
i
expect
it
just
the
same
explained
dona
untying
the
string
a
flush
of
rose
pink
spread
over
eric
cheeks
the
frail
little
hands
trembled
as
he
fingered
his
treasure
it
nicer
than
mine
it
got
coloured
pictures
he
gasped
if
it
jolts
him
to
be
wheeled
about
said
elaine
to
the
servant
girl
would
you
like
to
leave
him
here
with
us
while
you
go
into
whitecliffe
we
take
the
greatest
care
of
him
why
i
be
only
too
glad
i
can
tell
you
it
no
joke
wheeling
that
pram
up
the
hills
will
you
stay
here
eric
with
the
young
ladies
till
i
come
back
eric
nodded
gravely
he
was
busy
examining
the
illustrations
in
his
new
book
the
girls
wheeled
him
to
a
sheltered
place
out
of
the
wind
and
set
to
work
to
entertain
him
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
make
friends
i
got
names
for
you
all
he
said
shyly
i
made
them
up
while
i
was
in
bed
you
pointing
to
elaine
are
princess
goldilocks
and
you
with
a
finger
at
marjorie
and
dona
are
two
fairies
bluebell
and
silverstar
no
i
do
want
to
know
your
real
names
i
like
ones
better
we
always
play
fairies
when
titania
comes
to
see
me
who
titania
she
my
auntie
she
the
very
loveliest
person
in
all
the
world
there
no
one
like
her
we
have
such
fun
and
i
forget
my
leg
hurts
shall
we
play
fairies
now
if
you
show
us
how
said
the
girls
it
was
a
very
long
time
before
lizzie
well
laden
with
parcels
returned
from
whitecliffe
and
the
nurses
had
plenty
of
time
to
make
eric
acquaintance
they
found
him
a
charming
little
fellow
full
of
quaint
fancies
and
a
delicate
humour
his
chatter
amused
them
immensely
yet
there
was
an
element
of
pathos
through
it
all
he
looked
so
frail
and
delicate
like
a
fairy
changeling
or
some
being
of
another
world
they
wondered
if
he
would
ever
be
able
to
run
about
like
other
children
he
said
when
lizzie
full
of
apologies
and
thanks
resumed
her
charge
come
again
some
time
and
play
with
me
i
going
home
now
in
my
cinderella
coach
to
my
enchanted
palace
take
care
of
giants
on
your
way
back
and
do
talk
to
witches
i
wo
forget
you
he
hugging
his
book
said
marjorie
as
the
girls
stood
waving
a
farewell
is
he
just
too
precious
for
words
sweetest
thing
i
ever
seen
agreed
dona
poor
little
chap
i
wonder
if
he
ever
grow
up
said
elaine
thoughtfully
i
wish
we
asked
where
he
lives
and
we
might
have
sent
him
some
picture
post
cards
i
afraid
enchanted
palace
would
find
him
laughed
marjorie
we
must
try
to
come
here
another
wednesday
but
the
next
fortnightly
was
wet
and
after
that
the
days
began
to
grow
dark
early
and
aunt
ellinor
suggested
other
amusements
than
walks
on
the
cliffs
so
for
that
term
at
any
rate
the
girls
did
not
see
eric
again
he
seemed
to
have
made
his
appearance
suddenly
like
a
pixy
child
and
to
have
vanished
back
into
fairyland
there
was
a
link
between
them
however
and
some
time
fate
would
pull
the
chain
and
bring
their
lives
into
touch
once
more
chapter
v
autographs
the
brackenfielders
like
most
other
girls
were
given
to
fads
the
collecting
mania
in
a
variety
of
forms
raged
hot
and
strong
there
were
the
natural
history
enthusiasts
who
went
in
select
parties
personally
conducted
by
a
mistress
to
the
shore
at
low
tide
to
grub
blissfully
among
the
rocks
for
corallines
and
zoophytes
and
spider
crabs
and
madrepores
and
anemones
to
be
placed
carefully
in
jam
jars
and
brought
back
to
the
school
aquarium
the
gnats
as
the
members
of
the
natural
history
society
were
named
sometimes
pursued
their
investigations
with
more
zeal
than
discretion
and
they
generally
returned
from
their
rambles
with
skirts
much
the
worse
for
green
slime
and
sea
water
and
boots
coated
with
sand
and
mud
but
brimming
over
with
the
importance
of
their
finds
and
confounding
by
the
ease
with
which
they
rapped
out
long
scientific
names
those
who
had
caught
butterflies
and
moths
during
the
summer
spent
some
of
their
leisure
now
in
relaxing
and
setting
them
and
pinning
them
into
cases
it
was
considered
etiquette
to
offer
the
best
specimens
to
the
school
museum
but
the
girls
also
made
private
collections
and
vied
with
one
another
in
the
possession
of
rare
varieties
the
photographic
society
enjoyed
a
run
of
great
popularity
there
was
an
excellent
dark
room
with
every
facility
for
developing
and
washing
and
this
term
the
members
had
subscribed
for
an
enlarging
apparatus
with
which
they
hoped
to
do
great
things
as
well
as
these
recognized
school
pursuits
the
girls
had
all
kinds
of
minor
waves
of
fashion
in
the
way
of
hobbies
sometimes
they
liked
trifling
things
such
as
scraps
transfers
coloured
beads
pictures
taken
from
book
catalogues
or
illustrated
periodicals
newspaper
cuttings
or
attractive
advertisements
or
they
would
soar
to
the
more
serious
collecting
of
stamps
crests
badges
and
picture
post
cards
in
marjorie
dormitory
the
taste
was
for
celebrities
sylvia
page
who
was
musical
adorned
her
cubicle
with
charming
photogravures
of
the
great
composers
irene
andrews
whose
ambition
was
to
come
out
if
there
was
anybody
left
to
dance
with
after
the
war
pinned
up
the
portraits
of
society
beauties
betty
moore
of
sporting
tendencies
kept
the
illustrations
of
prize
dogs
and
their
owners
from
and
other
ladies
papers
marjorie
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
others
covered
her
fourth
share
of
the
wall
with
heroes
whenever
she
saw
that
some
member
of
his
majesty
forces
had
been
awarded
the
she
would
cut
out
his
portrait
and
add
it
to
her
gallery
of
honour
she
wrote
to
her
mother
and
her
sister
nora
to
help
her
in
this
hobby
with
the
consequence
that
every
letter
which
arrived
for
her
contained
enclosures
her
were
on
the
whole
and
in
return
for
some
contributions
she
had
given
to
their
collections
they
also
wrote
home
for
any
portraits
which
could
be
procured
as
the
girls
were
putting
away
their
clean
clothes
on
laundry
return
day
irene
fumbled
in
her
pocket
and
drew
out
a
letter
from
which
she
produced
some
cuttings
she
handed
them
to
marjorie
mother
sent
me
five
she
said
i
hope
you
have
got
them
already
two
are
rather
nice
and
clear
because
they
out
of
and
are
printed
on
better
paper
than
most
the
others
are
just
ordinary
all
fish
that
comes
to
my
net
replied
marjorie
i
think
topping
no
i
have
got
any
of
these
thanks
most
awfully
do
mench
i
try
to
beg
some
more
they
always
heaps
of
papers
and
magazines
at
home
and
mother
looks
through
them
to
find
my
pictures
no
you
not
taking
the
away
from
me
i
like
them
but
i
do
want
to
collect
them
my
cube
wo
hold
everything
marjorie
sat
down
on
her
bed
and
turned
over
the
new
additions
to
her
gallery
three
of
them
were
the
usual
rather
blurred
newspaper
prints
but
as
irene
had
said
two
were
on
superior
paper
and
very
clear
one
of
these
represented
an
officer
with
a
moustache
the
other
was
a
private
and
clean
shaven
marjorie
looked
at
them
at
first
rather
casually
then
examined
the
latter
with
interest
she
had
seen
that
face
before
the
shape
of
the
forehead
the
twinkling
dark
eyes
and
the
humorous
smile
all
seemed
familiar
instantly
there
rose
to
her
memory
a
vision
of
the
crowded
railway
carriage
from
silverwood
of
the
run
along
the
platform
at
rosebury
and
of
the
search
for
a
taxi
at
euston
i
verily
believe
it
that
nice
tommy
who
helped
us
she
gasped
to
herself
she
looked
at
the
inscription
underneath
which
set
forth
that
private
preston
west
yorks
regiment
had
been
awarded
the
for
pluck
in
removing
a
fired
stokes
shell
why
that
the
same
regiment
that
leonard
is
in
how
frightfully
interesting
she
thought
so
his
name
is
preston
i
wonder
what
stands
for
harry
or
herbert
or
hugh
or
horace
he
was
most
unmistakably
a
gentleman
he
going
to
have
the
best
place
among
my
heroes
if
the
picture
were
only
smaller
i
wear
it
in
a
locket
i
wonder
whether
i
could
get
it
reduced
if
i
joined
the
photographic
society
i
believe
i
give
in
my
name
on
the
chance
i
must
show
it
to
dona
she
be
thrilled
the
portrait
of
private
preston
was
accordingly
placed
in
a
bijou
frame
and
hung
up
on
the
wall
by
the
side
of
marjorie
bed
in
select
company
with
kitchener
sir
douglas
haig
the
prince
of
wales
and
his
majesty
the
king
she
looked
at
it
every
morning
when
she
woke
up
the
whimsical
brown
eyes
had
quite
a
friendly
expression
where
is
he
fighting
now
and
shall
i
ever
meet
him
again
she
wondered
i
glad
at
least
that
i
have
his
picture
marjorie
lived
for
news
of
the
war
she
devoured
the
sheets
of
foreign
paper
sent
home
by
father
bevis
and
leonard
she
followed
all
the
experiences
they
described
and
tried
to
imagine
them
in
their
on
the
march
sleeping
in
barns
or
cruising
the
channel
to
sweep
mines
when
she
awoke
in
the
night
and
heard
the
rain
falling
she
would
picture
the
wet
trenches
and
she
often
looked
at
the
calm
still
moon
and
thought
how
it
shone
alike
on
peaceful
white
cliffs
and
on
stained
in
flanders
the
aeroplanes
that
guarded
the
coast
were
a
source
of
immense
interest
at
brackenfield
the
girls
would
look
up
to
see
them
whizzing
overhead
there
was
a
poster
at
the
school
depicting
hostile
aircraft
and
they
often
gazed
into
the
sky
with
an
apprehension
that
one
of
the
hun
pattern
might
make
its
sudden
appearance
annie
turner
came
back
after
the
holiday
with
the
signatures
of
two
a
general
a
member
of
parliament
three
authors
an
inventor
and
a
composer
and
straightway
set
the
fashion
at
elgiva
for
autographs
nearly
every
girl
in
the
house
sent
to
the
stores
at
whitecliffe
for
an
album
at
present
of
course
specimens
of
caligraphy
could
only
be
had
from
mistresses
and
prefects
except
by
those
lucky
ones
whose
home
people
enclosed
for
them
little
slips
of
with
signatures
which
could
be
pasted
into
the
books
nobody
took
up
the
hobby
more
hotly
than
marjorie
her
album
was
bound
in
blue
morocco
with
gilt
edges
and
had
coloured
pages
the
portion
of
it
reserved
for
brackenfield
was
soon
filled
by
the
empress
mistresses
and
prefects
who
were
though
they
must
have
grown
very
weary
of
signing
their
names
in
such
a
large
number
of
books
outside
the
school
marjorie
so
far
had
no
luck
her
people
did
not
seem
to
have
any
very
noteworthy
acquaintances
or
at
any
rate
would
not
trouble
them
for
their
autographs
she
had
thought
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
father
to
secure
the
signatures
of
generals
and
diplomats
but
in
his
next
letter
he
did
not
even
refer
to
her
request
elaine
secured
for
her
the
name
of
the
commandant
of
the
red
cross
hospital
and
of
a
lady
who
sometimes
wrote
verses
to
be
set
to
music
but
these
could
not
compete
with
the
treasures
some
other
girls
had
to
show
marjorie
began
to
get
a
little
downhearted
about
the
new
fad
and
had
serious
thoughts
of
utilizing
the
album
as
a
book
of
quotations
then
one
day
something
happened
sixteen
girls
were
taken
by
miss
franklin
for
a
parade
walk
into
whitecliffe
and
marjorie
was
chosen
among
the
number
every
week
a
small
contingent
under
charge
of
a
mistress
was
allowed
to
go
into
the
town
to
do
some
shopping
the
chance
only
fell
once
in
a
term
to
each
individual
so
it
was
a
cherished
privilege
they
first
visited
the
stores
where
a
long
halt
was
allowed
in
the
confectionery
department
for
the
purchase
of
sweets
the
investment
in
these
was
considerable
for
each
girl
not
only
bought
her
own
but
executed
commissions
for
numerous
friends
there
was
a
school
limit
of
a
quarter
of
a
pound
per
head
but
miss
franklin
was
not
over
strict
and
the
rule
was
certainly
exceeded
the
book
and
magazine
counter
also
received
a
visit
and
the
stationery
department
for
there
was
at
present
a
fashion
for
fancy
paper
and
envelopes
with
or
picture
wafers
to
match
and
the
toilet
counter
had
its
customers
for
scent
and
cold
cream
and
practical
articles
such
as
sponges
and
tooth
paste
there
was
a
sensation
when
enid
young
was
discovered
surreptitiously
buying
pink
papier
poudré
though
she
assured
them
that
it
was
not
for
herself
but
for
one
of
the
seniors
whose
name
she
had
promised
not
to
divulge
under
pain
of
direst
extremities
poor
miss
franklin
had
an
agitating
hour
escorting
her
flock
from
one
department
to
another
of
the
stores
and
keeping
them
all
as
much
as
possible
together
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
street
and
walking
two
and
two
in
a
neat
crocodile
they
marched
down
sandy
walks
to
the
market
place
and
turned
along
the
promenade
to
go
back
by
the
cliff
road
in
this
autumn
season
there
were
generally
very
few
people
along
the
sea
front
but
quite
a
crowd
had
collected
on
the
sands
they
were
all
standing
gazing
up
into
the
sky
where
an
aeroplane
was
flitting
about
like
a
big
now
when
a
crowd
exhibits
agitation
bystanders
naturally
become
curious
as
to
what
is
the
cause
of
the
excitement
miss
franklin
though
a
teacher
was
human
moreover
she
always
suspected
every
aeroplane
of
being
german
in
its
origin
she
called
a
halt
therefore
and
enquired
from
one
of
the
what
was
the
matter
it
captain
devereux
the
great
french
airman
was
the
reply
just
flown
over
from
paris
and
he
been
looping
the
loop
there
going
to
do
it
again
immensely
thrilled
the
girls
stared
cloudwards
as
the
aeroplane
after
describing
several
circles
turned
a
neat
somersault
they
clapped
as
if
the
performance
had
been
specially
given
for
their
benefit
he
coming
down
he
going
to
descend
he
land
on
the
beach
came
in
excited
ejaculations
from
the
crowd
as
the
aeroplane
began
gently
to
drop
in
a
slanting
direction
towards
the
sands
like
the
wings
of
some
enormous
bird
the
great
planes
whizzed
by
and
in
another
moment
the
machine
was
resting
on
a
firm
piece
of
shingle
close
to
the
promenade
its
near
vicinity
was
quite
too
much
for
the
girls
without
waiting
for
permission
they
broke
ranks
and
rushed
down
the
steps
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
captain
devereux
had
alighted
and
was
now
standing
bowing
with
elaborate
french
politeness
to
the
various
strangers
who
addressed
him
and
answering
their
questions
as
to
the
length
of
time
it
had
taken
him
to
fly
from
paris
he
looked
so
courteous
and
that
a
sudden
idea
flashed
into
head
and
without
waiting
to
ask
leave
from
miss
franklin
she
rushed
up
to
the
distinguished
aviator
and
panted
out
impulsively
oh
i
do
think
it
was
splendid
will
you
please
give
me
your
autograph
the
frenchman
smiled
with
pleasure
mademoiselle
he
replied
gallantly
and
taking
a
notebook
and
fountain
pen
from
his
pocket
he
wrote
in
a
neat
foreign
hand
henri
raoul
devereux
and
handed
the
slip
to
the
delighted
marjorie
oh
write
one
for
me
please
and
for
me
exclaimed
the
other
girls
anxious
to
have
their
share
if
autographs
were
being
given
away
the
airman
was
perhaps
a
little
flattered
at
receiving
so
much
attention
from
a
bevy
of
young
ladies
he
rapidly
scribbled
his
signature
tearing
out
sheet
after
sheet
from
his
notebook
so
excited
were
the
girls
that
they
would
take
no
notice
of
miss
franklin
who
called
them
to
order
it
was
not
until
the
sixteenth
damsel
had
received
her
coveted
scrap
of
paper
that
discipline
was
restored
and
the
crocodile
once
more
formed
and
marched
off
in
the
direction
of
brackenfield
miss
franklin
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
mouth
was
set
she
did
not
speak
on
the
way
back
but
at
the
gate
her
indignation
found
words
i
never
was
so
ashamed
in
my
life
she
burst
forth
i
shall
at
once
report
your
unladylike
conduct
to
morrison
you
a
disgrace
to
the
school
chapter
vi
trouble
marjorie
and
her
fellow
autograph
collectors
from
elgiva
entered
the
in
a
state
of
much
exhilaration
to
boast
of
their
achievement
you
did
exclaimed
betty
moore
you
mean
to
say
you
ran
up
and
asked
him
under
frankie
very
nose
marjorie
you
are
the
limit
he
was
as
nice
as
anything
about
it
i
think
he
a
perfect
dear
he
did
seem
to
mind
at
all
rather
liked
it
in
fact
here
his
neat
little
signature
do
you
want
to
look
well
you
have
luck
though
you
need
so
dreadfully
over
it
how
did
frankie
take
it
oh
she
was
rather
ratty
of
course
but
who
cares
we
got
our
autographs
and
that
the
main
thing
one
has
to
risk
something
we
get
something
too
in
my
opinion
said
patricia
lennox
one
of
the
sinners
frankie
was
worse
than
ratty
she
was
absolutely
savage
i
could
see
it
in
her
eye
well
we
ca
help
it
if
we
do
receive
a
few
order
marks
it
was
well
worth
it
in
my
opinion
chuckled
marjorie
shamelessly
she
bluffed
things
off
before
the
other
girls
but
secretly
she
felt
rather
uneasy
miss
franklin
threat
to
report
the
matter
to
morrison
recurred
to
her
memory
at
brackenfield
to
carry
any
question
to
the
principal
was
an
extreme
measure
the
empress
liked
her
teachers
to
be
able
to
manage
their
girls
on
their
own
authority
and
knowing
this
they
generally
conducted
their
struggles
without
appeal
to
any
very
flagrant
breach
of
discipline
however
was
expected
to
be
reported
so
that
the
case
could
be
dealt
with
as
it
deserved
marjorie
went
into
the
for
tea
with
a
thrill
akin
to
that
which
she
usually
suffered
when
visiting
the
dentist
to
judge
from
their
heightened
colour
and
conspicuously
callous
manner
rose
butler
patricia
lennox
phyllis
bingham
laura
norris
gertrude
holmes
and
evelyn
pickard
were
experiencing
the
same
sensations
they
fully
expected
to
receive
three
order
marks
apiece
which
would
mean
bed
immediately
after
supper
instead
of
going
to
the
needlework
union
to
their
surprise
miss
franklin
took
no
notice
of
them
she
was
sitting
amongst
the
juniors
and
did
not
even
look
in
their
direction
they
took
care
not
to
do
anything
which
should
attract
attention
to
themselves
and
the
meal
passed
over
in
safety
preparation
followed
immediately
marjorie
found
the
image
of
the
aviator
and
miss
franklin
outraged
expression
kept
obtruding
themselves
through
her
studies
causing
sad
confusion
amongst
french
irregular
verbs
and
driving
the
principal
battles
of
the
civil
wars
into
the
sidewalks
of
her
memory
she
made
a
valiant
effort
to
pull
herself
together
and
looking
up
caught
rose
butler
eye
rose
held
up
for
a
moment
a
piece
of
paper
upon
which
she
had
executed
a
fancy
sketch
of
captain
devereux
and
his
aeroplane
surrounded
by
schoolgirls
and
miss
franklin
in
the
background
raising
hands
of
horror
it
was
too
much
for
marjorie
sense
of
humour
and
she
chuckled
audibly
miss
norton
promptly
glared
in
her
direction
and
gave
her
an
order
mark
which
sobered
her
considerably
when
preparation
was
over
the
girls
changed
their
dresses
and
came
down
for
supper
and
again
miss
franklin
took
no
notice
of
the
sinners
of
the
afternoon
they
began
to
breathe
more
freely
perhaps
she
going
to
overlook
it
whispered
rose
after
all
i
ca
see
that
we
did
anything
so
very
wrong
maintained
phyllis
frankie
jealous
because
she
did
get
an
autograph
for
herself
chuckled
laura
i
do
believe
we
shall
hear
another
word
about
it
asserted
evelyn
the
interval
between
supper
and
prayers
was
spent
by
the
girls
in
their
own
hostels
at
present
each
house
was
busy
with
a
needlework
union
they
were
making
articles
for
a
small
bazaar
that
was
to
be
held
at
the
school
in
the
spring
in
aid
of
the
red
cross
society
they
sat
and
sewed
while
a
mistress
read
a
book
aloud
to
them
marjorie
was
embroidering
a
nightdress
case
in
she
used
a
frame
and
enjoyed
pulling
her
ribbons
through
into
semblance
of
little
pink
roses
and
blue
in
contrast
with
french
verbs
and
the
civil
wars
the
occupation
was
soothing
ever
afterwards
it
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
story
of
which
was
being
read
aloud
and
the
very
sight
of
would
recall
miss
matty
or
the
other
quaint
inhabitants
of
the
village
at
ten
minutes
to
nine
a
bell
rang
were
put
away
and
the
girls
trooped
into
the
big
hall
for
prayers
if
by
that
time
any
remembrance
of
her
afternoon
misdeeds
entered
marjorie
mind
it
was
to
congratulate
herself
that
the
trouble
had
blown
over
successfully
she
was
certainly
not
prepared
for
what
was
to
happen
morrison
mounted
the
platform
as
usual
and
read
prayers
and
the
customary
hymn
followed
at
its
close
instead
of
dismissing
the
girls
to
their
hostels
the
principal
made
a
signal
for
them
to
resume
their
seats
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
this
evening
she
began
gravely
something
which
i
feel
demands
the
presence
of
the
whole
school
it
is
with
the
very
greatest
regret
i
bring
this
matter
before
you
brackenfield
as
you
are
aware
will
soon
celebrate
its
tenth
birthday
during
all
these
years
of
its
existence
it
has
always
prided
itself
upon
the
extremely
high
reputation
in
respect
of
manners
and
conduct
which
its
pupils
have
maintained
in
the
neighbourhood
so
far
at
whitecliffe
the
name
of
a
brackenfield
girl
has
been
synonymous
with
perfectly
and
absolutely
ladylike
behaviour
there
are
other
schools
in
the
town
and
it
is
possible
that
there
may
be
among
them
some
spirit
of
rivalry
towards
brackenfield
the
inhabitants
or
visitors
at
whitecliffe
will
naturally
notice
any
party
of
girls
who
are
proceeding
in
line
through
the
town
they
will
note
their
school
hats
observe
their
conduct
and
judge
accordingly
the
establishment
from
which
they
come
every
girl
when
on
parade
has
the
reputation
of
brackenfield
in
her
keeping
so
strong
has
been
the
spirit
not
only
of
loyalty
to
the
school
but
of
innate
good
breeding
that
up
to
this
day
our
traditions
have
never
yet
been
broken
i
say
sorrowfully
up
till
for
this
very
afternoon
an
event
has
occurred
which
in
the
estimation
of
myself
and
my
colleagues
has
trailed
our
brackenfield
standards
in
the
dust
sixteen
girls
who
under
privilege
of
a
parade
exeat
visited
whitecliffe
have
behaved
in
a
manner
which
fills
me
with
astonishment
and
disgust
that
they
could
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
break
line
rush
on
to
the
shore
crowd
round
and
address
a
perfect
stranger
passes
my
comprehension
and
this
under
the
eyes
of
two
other
schools
who
were
walking
along
the
promenade
and
who
must
have
been
justly
amazed
and
shocked
the
girls
who
this
afternoon
were
on
exeat
parade
will
kindly
stand
up
sixteen
miserable
sinners
rose
to
their
feet
and
feeling
themselves
the
centre
for
more
than
two
hundred
pairs
of
eyes
yearned
for
the
earth
to
yawn
and
swallow
them
up
morrison
regarded
them
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
each
of
you
will
now
go
to
her
own
house
and
fetch
the
autograph
she
secured
continued
the
mistress
grimly
i
give
you
three
minutes
there
was
a
hurried
exit
and
the
school
sat
and
waited
until
the
luckless
sixteen
returned
bring
them
to
me
commanded
morrison
and
in
turn
each
girl
handed
over
her
slip
of
paper
with
the
magic
signature
henri
raoul
devereux
the
principal
placed
them
together
then
her
eyes
flashing
tore
them
into
shreds
girls
who
have
deliberately
broken
rules
defied
the
authority
of
my
colleague
which
is
equivalent
to
defying
me
and
have
lowered
the
prestige
of
the
school
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
deserve
the
contempt
of
their
comrades
who
i
hope
will
show
their
opinion
of
such
conduct
i
feel
that
any
imposition
i
can
give
them
is
inadequate
and
that
their
own
sense
of
shame
should
be
sufficient
punishment
yet
in
order
to
enforce
the
lesson
i
shall
expect
each
to
recite
ten
lines
of
poetry
to
her
house
mistress
every
morning
before
breakfast
until
the
end
of
the
term
and
marjorie
anderson
who
i
understand
was
the
instigator
of
the
whole
affair
will
spend
saturday
afternoon
indoors
until
she
has
copied
out
the
whole
of
bacon
essay
on
you
may
go
now
marjorie
slunk
off
to
elgiva
in
an
utterly
wretched
frame
of
mind
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
reproved
in
company
with
fifteen
others
but
to
be
singled
out
for
special
condemnation
and
held
up
to
obloquy
before
all
the
school
was
terrible
in
spite
of
herself
hot
tears
were
in
her
eyes
she
tried
to
blink
them
back
for
crying
was
scouted
at
brackenfield
but
just
at
that
moment
she
came
across
rose
phyllis
laura
and
gertrude
weeping
openly
in
a
corner
i
never
hold
up
my
head
again
gulped
phyllis
oh
the
empress
was
cross
and
i
sure
it
was
all
because
those
wretched
girls
from
hall
and
birches
were
walking
along
the
promenade
and
saw
us
if
they
had
any
sense
they
have
rushed
down
and
asked
for
autographs
for
themselves
it
was
mean
of
the
empress
to
tear
ours
up
moaned
gertrude
i
call
that
a
piece
of
temper
on
her
part
and
after
all
i
do
see
that
we
did
anything
so
very
dreadful
choked
rose
morrison
was
awfully
down
on
us
i
hate
learning
poetry
before
breakfast
wailed
laura
i
the
worst
off
sighed
marjorie
i
got
to
spend
saturday
afternoon
and
it
the
match
with
holcombe
i
just
the
unluckiest
girl
in
the
whole
school
strafe
it
all
it
a
grizzly
nuisance
i
should
like
to
slay
myself
to
marjorie
no
punishment
was
greater
than
being
forced
to
stay
indoors
she
was
essentially
an
girl
and
after
a
long
morning
in
the
schoolroom
her
whole
soul
craved
for
the
she
had
taken
up
hockey
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
she
keenly
enjoyed
the
practices
and
was
deeply
interested
in
the
matches
played
by
the
school
team
the
event
on
saturday
afternoon
was
considered
to
be
of
special
importance
for
brackenfield
was
to
play
the
first
eleven
of
the
holcombe
club
they
had
rather
a
good
reputation
and
the
game
would
probably
be
a
stiff
tussle
every
brackenfielder
considered
it
her
duty
to
be
present
to
watch
the
match
and
encourage
the
school
eleven
marjorie
would
have
given
worlds
to
evade
her
punishment
task
that
saturday
but
morrison
orders
were
as
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
can
not
be
altered
so
she
was
policed
to
the
by
miss
norton
and
provided
with
sheets
of
exercise
paper
and
a
copy
of
bacon
i
shall
expect
it
to
be
finished
by
said
the
mistress
briefly
if
not
you
will
have
to
stay
in
again
on
monday
marjorie
frowned
at
the
threat
of
further
confinement
and
settled
herself
with
rather
aggressive
slowness
she
was
in
a
pixy
mood
and
did
not
mean
to
show
any
special
haste
in
beginning
her
unwelcome
work
miss
norton
glared
at
her
but
made
no
further
remark
and
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
left
the
room
all
the
girls
had
already
gone
to
the
and
marjorie
had
elgiva
to
herself
she
opened
the
book
languidly
found
essay
xix
of
empire
and
groaned
it
take
me
the
whole
afternoon
strafe
it
all
she
muttered
i
wish
francis
bacon
had
never
existed
i
wonder
the
empress
did
tell
me
to
write
an
essay
on
aeroplanes
if
i
drew
them
all
round
the
edges
of
the
pages
i
wonder
what
would
happen
i
love
to
do
it
and
put
captain
devereux
picture
at
the
end
i
expect
i
get
expelled
if
i
did
oh
dear
it
a
weary
world
i
wish
i
were
old
enough
to
leave
school
and
drive
a
transport
wagon
have
i
got
to
stop
here
till
eighteen
another
two
years
and
a
half
nearly
it
gives
me
spasms
to
think
of
it
she
dipped
her
pen
in
the
ink
and
copied
it
is
a
miserable
state
of
mind
to
have
few
things
to
desire
and
many
things
to
fear
i
agree
with
old
bacon
she
commented
only
i
got
great
heaps
of
things
to
desire
and
the
one
i
want
most
at
present
is
to
go
to
the
hockey
match
i
wish
his
shade
would
come
and
help
me
they
did
play
hockey
in
his
days
so
it
would
be
a
new
experience
for
him
francis
bacon
i
command
you
to
give
me
a
hand
with
your
wretched
essay
and
i
take
you
to
the
match
in
return
a
smart
on
the
window
behind
her
made
marjorie
start
and
turn
round
in
a
hurry
her
invocation
however
had
not
called
up
the
ghostly
countenance
of
the
defunct
sir
francis
to
face
her
it
was
eyes
which
twinkled
at
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
pane
open
the
window
ordered
that
damsel
marjorie
obeyed
in
much
amazement
dona
was
standing
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
which
just
reached
to
the
old
williams
has
been
clipping
the
ivy
she
explained
so
commandeered
his
ladder
i
have
broken
any
rules
i
never
been
told
that
i
must
get
up
a
ladder
the
girls
at
elgiva
was
on
the
upper
floor
and
members
of
other
houses
were
strictly
forbidden
to
mount
the
stairs
marjorie
laughed
at
dona
evasion
of
the
edict
give
me
a
hand
and
i
toddle
in
continued
the
latter
steady
oh
do
pull
too
hard
here
i
am
glad
to
see
you
but
you
get
into
a
jinky
little
row
if
the
acid
drop
catches
you
right
oh
chucky
the
acid
drop
is
at
this
moment
watching
the
team
for
all
she
worth
she
awfully
keen
on
hockey
i
know
and
so
am
i
said
marjorie
aggrievedly
it
the
limit
to
miss
this
match
you
not
going
to
miss
it
altogether
i
come
to
help
you
here
give
me
a
pen
and
i
copy
some
of
the
stuff
out
for
you
our
writing
so
alike
no
one
will
guess
and
you
get
out
at
you
mascot
but
you
missing
the
match
yourself
i
do
care
twopence
i
not
keen
on
hockey
like
you
are
give
me
a
pen
i
tell
you
but
how
are
we
to
manage
objected
marjorie
if
we
do
alternate
pages
we
sha
each
know
where
to
begin
and
we
ca
leave
spaces
or
the
acid
drop
would
twig
marjorie
anderson
i
always
thought
you
more
brains
than
i
have
but
you
not
clever
you
must
write
small
so
as
to
get
each
line
of
print
exactly
into
a
line
of
exercise
paper
there
are
twenty
blue
lines
on
each
sheet
very
well
then
you
copy
the
first
twenty
of
old
bacon
and
i
copy
the
second
twenty
and
there
we
are
alternate
pages
as
neat
as
you
please
dona
you
a
touch
of
genius
about
you
purred
marjorie
the
plan
answered
admirably
by
writing
small
it
was
quite
possible
to
bring
each
line
of
print
into
correspondence
with
the
manuscript
there
were
a
hundred
and
twenty
lines
altogether
in
the
essay
which
worked
out
at
six
pages
of
exercise
paper
each
counted
out
her
own
portion
then
scribbled
away
as
fast
as
was
consistent
with
keeping
the
size
of
her
caligraphy
within
due
bounds
minutes
hard
work
brought
them
to
the
last
word
marjorie
breathed
a
sigh
of
rapture
fastened
the
pages
together
with
a
clip
and
took
them
downstairs
to
miss
study
you
an
absolute
trump
old
girl
she
said
to
dona
the
latter
meantime
had
run
downstairs
and
removed
the
ladder
back
to
where
she
had
found
it
so
that
no
trace
of
her
little
adventure
should
be
left
behind
the
two
girls
hurried
off
to
the
but
took
care
not
to
approach
together
in
case
of
awakening
suspicions
everybody
attention
was
so
concentrated
on
the
match
that
marjorie
slipped
into
a
crowd
of
intermediates
unnoticed
by
mistresses
she
was
in
time
for
part
of
the
game
and
keenly
enjoyed
watching
a
brilliant
run
by
daisy
edwards
and
a
terrific
tussle
on
the
back
line
resulting
in
a
splendid
shot
by
hilda
alworthy
when
the
whistle
blew
for
time
the
score
stood
six
goals
to
three
brackenfield
leading
and
marjorie
joined
with
enthusiasm
in
the
cheers
she
loitered
a
little
in
the
field
and
came
back
among
the
last
miss
norton
who
was
standing
in
the
hall
looked
at
her
keenly
as
she
entered
elgiva
but
the
teacher
had
just
found
the
essay
of
empire
laid
on
her
desk
and
turning
it
over
had
marked
it
correct
if
she
had
any
suspicions
she
did
not
voice
them
but
allowed
the
matter
to
pass
chapter
vii
dormitory
no
after
the
sad
fiasco
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
marjorie
interest
in
autographs
languished
she
took
up
photography
instead
and
bartered
a
quite
nice
little
collection
of
foreign
stamps
with
one
of
the
seniors
in
exchange
for
a
kodak
of
course
it
was
much
too
late
in
the
year
for
snapshots
but
she
managed
to
get
a
few
time
exposures
on
bright
days
and
enjoyed
herself
afterwards
in
the
she
wanted
to
make
a
series
of
views
of
the
school
and
send
them
to
her
father
and
to
her
brothers
for
she
knew
how
much
they
appreciated
such
things
at
the
front
in
his
last
letter
to
her
daddy
had
said
i
am
glad
you
and
dona
are
happy
at
brackenfield
and
wish
i
could
picture
you
there
i
expect
it
is
something
like
a
boys
school
tell
me
about
your
doings
i
love
to
have
your
letters
even
though
i
may
not
have
time
to
answer
them
daddy
letters
were
generally
of
the
description
and
were
handed
on
from
one
member
to
another
of
the
family
but
this
had
been
specially
written
to
marjorie
and
addressed
to
brackenfield
so
it
was
a
great
treasure
she
determined
to
do
her
best
to
satisfy
the
demands
for
photos
you
darling
she
said
kissing
his
portrait
i
think
you
a
thousand
times
than
any
of
the
other
girls
fathers
i
do
wonder
when
you
get
leave
and
come
home
if
it
not
in
the
holidays
i
declare
i
run
away
and
see
you
in
her
form
marjorie
was
making
fair
progress
she
liked
miss
duckworth
her
teacher
and
on
the
whole
did
not
find
the
work
too
hard
her
brains
were
bright
when
she
chose
to
use
them
and
at
present
the
thought
of
the
christmas
report
which
would
be
sent
out
for
daddy
to
look
at
spurred
on
her
efforts
so
far
marjorie
had
not
made
any
very
great
chums
at
school
she
inclined
to
mollie
simpson
but
mollie
like
herself
was
of
a
rather
masterful
disposition
and
squabbles
almost
invariably
ensued
before
the
two
had
been
long
together
with
the
three
girls
who
shared
her
dormitory
she
was
on
quite
friendly
though
not
warm
terms
they
had
at
first
considered
marjorie
inclined
to
boss
and
had
made
her
thoroughly
understand
that
as
a
new
girl
such
an
attitude
could
not
be
tolerated
in
her
so
long
as
she
was
content
to
manage
her
own
cubicle
and
not
theirs
they
were
pleasant
enough
but
they
united
in
a
firm
triumvirate
of
resistance
whenever
symptoms
of
swelled
head
began
to
arise
in
their
one
evening
about
the
end
of
november
the
four
girls
were
dressing
for
supper
in
their
dormitory
it
a
grizzly
nuisance
having
to
change
one
frock
groused
betty
moore
it
seems
so
silly
to
array
oneself
in
white
just
to
eat
supper
and
do
a
little
sewing
afterwards
i
hate
the
bother
do
you
exclaimed
irene
andrews
now
i
like
it
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
piggy
to
wear
the
same
serge
dress
from
breakfast
to
bedtime
brackenfield
scores
over
some
schools
in
that
they
certainly
make
things
nice
for
us
in
the
evenings
um
yes
tolerably
put
in
sylvia
page
we
do
get
enough
music
in
my
opinion
we
have
a
concert
every
saturday
night
and
charades
on
wednesdays
for
those
who
care
to
act
i
like
gym
practice
every
evening
said
betty
then
i
change
my
frock
when
i
leave
school
i
mean
to
go
on
a
farm
and
wear
corduroy
knickers
and
leggings
and
thick
boots
all
the
time
it
be
gorgeous
i
love
anything
to
do
with
horses
so
perhaps
they
let
me
plough
what
shall
you
do
marjorie
something
to
help
the
war
if
it
is
over
i
nurse
or
drive
a
wagon
or
ride
a
with
dispatches
i
rather
ride
a
horse
than
a
bike
any
day
said
betty
i
used
to
hunt
before
the
war
you
need
smile
i
was
twelve
when
the
war
began
and
i
been
hunting
since
i
was
seven
and
got
my
first
pony
it
was
a
darling
little
brown
shetland
named
sheila
i
cried
oceans
when
it
died
my
next
was
a
grey
one
named
charlie
and
tom
our
coachman
taught
me
to
take
fences
he
put
up
some
little
hurdles
in
a
field
and
kept
making
them
higher
and
higher
till
i
could
get
charlie
over
quite
well
oh
it
was
sport
i
wish
i
a
pony
here
there
used
to
be
riding
lessons
before
the
war
sighed
irene
mother
had
promised
me
i
should
learn
but
now
of
course
there
are
no
horses
to
be
had
and
the
hall
has
gone
to
the
front
i
wonder
if
things
will
ever
be
the
same
again
if
i
do
learn
to
ride
properly
while
i
young
i
never
have
a
decent
seat
afterwards
i
suppose
you
certainly
wo
betty
assured
her
you
ought
to
have
begun
when
you
were
seven
oh
dear
and
i
shall
be
sixteen
on
wednesday
is
it
your
birthday
next
wednesday
yes
but
it
wo
be
much
fun
we
not
allowed
to
do
anything
particular
worse
luck
it
was
one
of
the
brackenfield
rules
that
no
notice
must
be
taken
of
birthdays
girls
might
receive
presents
from
home
but
they
were
not
to
claim
any
special
privileges
or
exemptions
to
ask
for
exeats
or
to
bring
cakes
into
the
in
a
school
of
more
than
two
hundred
pupils
it
would
have
been
difficult
continually
to
make
allowances
first
to
one
girl
and
then
to
another
and
though
in
a
sense
all
recognized
the
necessity
of
the
rule
those
whose
birthdays
fell
during
bemoaned
their
hard
fate
it
struck
marjorie
as
a
very
cheerless
proceeding
she
found
an
opportunity
when
irene
was
out
of
the
way
to
talk
to
her
on
the
subject
look
here
she
began
it
renie
birthday
on
wednesday
i
do
think
it
the
limit
that
we
not
supposed
to
take
any
notice
of
it
i
vote
we
get
up
a
little
on
our
own
for
her
let
have
a
beano
after
we
in
bed
what
a
blossomy
idea
good
for
you
marjorie
i
your
man
if
any
fun
on
foot
agreed
betty
enthusiastically
it
be
lovely
but
how
are
we
going
to
manage
the
catering
department
enquired
sylvia
some
of
the
juniors
will
be
going
on
parade
to
whitecliffe
on
wednesday
i
ask
dona
to
ask
them
to
get
a
few
things
for
us
we
must
have
a
cake
and
some
candles
and
some
cocoa
and
some
condensed
milk
and
anything
else
they
can
smuggle
are
you
game
rather
if
you
undertake
to
be
general
of
the
commissariat
department
all
serene
do
say
a
word
about
it
to
anyone
else
at
elgiva
i
swear
dona
to
secrecy
and
the
ethelberta
kids
are
likely
to
tell
they
do
the
same
themselves
sometimes
and
do
on
any
account
let
renie
have
wind
of
it
it
to
be
a
surprise
on
wednesday
evening
before
supper
marjorie
met
dona
by
special
appointment
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
latter
hastily
thrust
a
parcel
into
her
arms
you
would
believe
what
difficulty
i
had
to
get
it
she
whispered
mona
and
peachy
were
at
all
willing
they
said
they
did
see
why
they
should
take
risks
for
elgiva
and
you
might
run
your
own
beano
i
had
to
bribe
them
with
ever
so
many
of
my
best
crests
before
i
could
make
them
promise
they
say
miss
jones
has
got
suspicious
now
about
bulgy
coats
and
actually
feels
them
they
have
to
sling
bags
under
their
skirts
and
it
so
uncomfy
walking
home
however
they
did
their
best
for
you
there
a
cake
and
three
boxes
of
candles
and
a
tin
of
condensed
milk
they
could
get
the
cocoa
because
just
as
they
were
going
to
buy
it
miss
jones
came
up
everything
dearer
and
you
did
give
them
enough
mona
paid
and
you
owe
her
fivepence
halfpenny
extra
i
give
it
you
at
thank
them
both
most
awfully
i
think
they
regular
trumps
i
give
them
some
of
my
crests
if
they
like
i
not
really
collecting
and
do
want
them
think
of
us
about
midnight
if
you
happen
to
wake
i
wish
you
could
join
us
so
do
i
but
that
quite
out
of
the
question
never
mind
we
have
bits
of
fun
ourselves
sometimes
marjorie
managed
to
convey
her
parcel
unnoticed
to
no
dormitory
according
to
arrangement
betty
and
sylvia
were
waiting
there
for
her
irene
still
oblivious
of
the
treat
in
store
for
her
had
not
yet
come
upstairs
the
three
confederates
undid
their
package
and
gloated
over
its
contents
the
cake
was
quite
a
respectable
one
for
to
judge
from
appearances
it
had
cherries
in
it
and
there
was
a
piece
of
candied
peel
on
the
top
the
little
boxes
of
candles
held
half
a
dozen
apiece
assorted
colours
they
took
sixteen
of
them
sharpened
the
ends
and
stuck
them
down
into
the
cake
when
it
lighted
it
will
look
a
purred
betty
how
are
we
going
to
open
the
tin
of
condensed
milk
asked
sylvia
it
one
of
those
tins
you
prise
up
said
marjorie
jauntily
give
it
to
me
a
penny
the
best
weapon
here
you
are
quite
easy
yes
but
there
another
lid
underneath
you
not
at
the
milk
yet
marjorie
feathers
began
to
fall
she
was
not
quite
as
clever
as
she
had
thought
here
i
do
it
said
betty
snatching
the
tin
take
down
a
picture
and
pull
the
nail
out
of
the
wall
and
give
me
a
boot
to
hammer
with
you
to
go
through
this
arrow
point
and
then
the
thing
prises
up
steady
here
we
are
cave
renie
coming
stick
the
things
away
marjorie
hastily
seized
the
feast
and
bestowed
it
inside
her
wardrobe
thanks
to
the
drawn
curtains
of
her
cubicle
irene
had
not
obtained
even
a
glimpse
what
are
you
three
doing
inside
there
she
asked
curiously
but
no
one
would
tell
the
secret
was
not
to
be
given
away
too
soon
the
conspirators
had
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
not
to
ask
any
other
girls
to
join
the
party
but
to
keep
the
affair
entirely
to
their
own
dormitory
they
make
such
a
noise
if
we
have
them
in
and
it
will
wake
the
acid
drop
and
bring
her
down
upon
us
said
sylvia
besides
which
it
only
a
small
cake
and
would
go
round
stated
betty
practically
irene
went
to
bed
in
a
fit
of
the
blues
only
half
her
presents
had
turned
up
and
two
of
her
aunts
had
not
written
to
her
it
been
a
rotten
birthday
she
groaned
i
knew
it
would
be
hateful
having
it
at
school
why
was
i
born
in
the
holidays
there
ought
to
be
a
law
regulating
births
to
certain
times
of
the
year
if
i
were
head
of
a
school
i
let
every
girl
go
home
for
her
birthday
do
speak
to
me
i
feel
scratchy
her
chuckled
and
for
the
present
left
her
alone
sylvia
began
to
sing
a
song
about
tears
turning
to
smiles
and
sorrow
to
joy
until
irene
begged
her
to
stop
it
the
limit
when
i
blue
the
one
thing
i
ca
stand
is
anybody
trying
to
cheer
me
up
it
gets
on
my
nerves
sleep
it
off
old
sport
laughed
marjorie
i
do
mind
betting
that
when
you
wake
up
you
feel
in
a
very
different
frame
of
mind
at
which
remark
the
others
spluttered
you
find
illumination
in
fact
hinnied
betty
i
think
you
all
most
unkind
quavered
irene
the
confederates
had
decided
to
wait
until
the
magic
hour
of
midnight
before
they
began
their
beano
they
felt
it
was
wiser
to
give
miss
norton
plenty
of
time
to
go
to
bed
and
fall
asleep
she
often
sat
up
late
in
the
study
reading
and
they
did
not
care
to
risk
a
visit
from
her
a
bracket
clock
on
the
stairs
sounded
the
quarters
and
marjorie
as
the
lightest
sleeper
undertook
to
keep
awake
and
listen
to
its
chimes
it
was
rather
difficult
not
to
doze
when
the
room
was
dark
and
her
companions
were
breathing
quietly
and
regularly
in
the
other
beds
the
time
between
the
quarters
seemed
interminable
at
eleven
she
heard
miss
norton
walk
along
the
corridor
and
go
into
her
bedroom
after
that
no
other
sound
disturbed
the
establishment
and
marjorie
repeated
poetry
and
even
dates
and
french
verbs
to
keep
herself
awake
at
last
the
clock
chimed
its
full
range
and
struck
twelve
times
she
sat
up
and
felt
for
the
matches
betty
and
sylvia
who
had
gone
to
sleep
prepared
woke
with
the
light
but
it
was
a
more
difficult
matter
to
rouse
irene
she
turned
over
in
bed
and
grunted
and
they
were
obliged
to
haul
her
into
a
sitting
position
before
she
would
open
her
eyes
what
the
matter
zepps
she
asked
drowsily
no
no
it
your
birthday
party
look
beamed
the
others
on
a
chair
by
her
bedside
stood
the
cake
resplendent
with
its
sixteen
little
lighted
candles
and
also
the
tin
of
condensed
milk
irene
blinked
at
them
in
amazement
jubilate
what
a
frolicsome
joke
she
exclaimed
i
say
this
is
awfully
decent
of
you
we
told
you
you
wake
up
in
better
spirits
old
sport
purred
marjorie
i
flatter
myself
those
candles
look
rather
pretty
you
can
tell
your
fortune
by
blowing
them
out
it
a
shame
to
touch
them
objected
irene
but
we
want
some
cake
announced
betty
and
sylvia
go
on
give
a
good
puff
prompted
marjorie
then
we
can
count
how
many
you
blown
out

this
year
next
year
some
time
never
this
year
goody
you
have
to
be
quick
about

it
almost
time
to
be
putting
up
the
banns
now
again
tinker

all
the
luck

you
not
blowing

renie
you
did
that
on
purpose
so
that
it
should
come
wheelbarrow
only
one
candle
left
let
leave
it
lighted
while
we
cut
the
rest
everybody
agreed
that
the
cake
was
delicious
they
felt
they
had
never
tasted
a
better
in
their
lives
although
it
was
a
specimen
of
cookery
i
wish
we
could
have
got
some
cocoa
sighed
betty
i
tried
to
borrow
a
little
and
a
spirit
lamp
from
meg
hutchinson
but
she
says
they
get
any
methylated
spirit
now
condensed
milk
is
delicious
by
itself
suggested
sylvia
sorry
we
have
a
spoon
apologized
marjorie
for
lack
of
other
means
of
getting
at
their
sweet
delicacy
the
girls
dipped
into
the
condensed
milk
and
took
what
they
could
it
rather
like
white
honey
decided
betty
after
a
critical
taste
yes
i
certainly
think
it
quite
topping
it
makes
me
think
of
russian
toffee
do
speak
of
toffee
we
have
made
any
since
sugar
went
short
jemima
i
shall
eat
heaps
when
the
war
over
you
greedy
pig
you
ought
to
leave
it
for
the
soldiers
but
there
wo
be
any
soldiers
then
yes
there
be
some
for
years
and
years
afterwards
they
take
some
time
you
know
to
get
well
in
the
hospitals
then
there
a
chance
for
me
to
nurse
exclaimed
marjorie
i
always
so
afraid
the
war
will
all
be
over
before
i
left
school
and
i
say
what
that
noise
interrupted
irene
anxiously
if
the
acid
drop
drops
on
us
she
be
very
acid
indeed
for
reply
marjorie
popped
the
condensed
milk
tin
into
her
wardrobe
blew
out
the
candle
and
hopped
into
bed
an
example
which
was
followed
by
the
others
with
equal
dispatch
they
were
only
just
in
time
for
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
and
miss
norton
clad
in
a
blue
flashed
her
torchlight
into
the
room
seeing
the
girls
all
in
bed
and
apparently
fast
asleep
she
did
not
enter
but
closed
the
door
softly
and
they
heard
her
footsteps
walking
away
down
the
corridor
a
near
shave
murmured
marjorie
sh
sh
do
let
talk
she
may
come
back
and
listen
outside
whispered
sylvia
with
a
keen
distrust
for
miss
norton
notions
of
vigilance
next
morning
the
girls
in
no
dormitory
mentioned
that
they
had
heard
a
noise
during
the
night
somebody
walked
down
the
passage
proclaimed
lennie
jackson
enid
thought
it
was
a
ghost
i
thought
it
was
somebody
walking
in
her
sleep
maintained
daisy
shaw
oh
how
horrid
shivered
barbara
wright
i
be
scared
to
death
of
anyone
i
rather
meet
a
ghost
any
day
did
you
see
somebody
enquired
betty
casually
no
it
was
only
what
we
heard
stealthy
footsteps
you
know
that
moved
softly
along
just
as
they
described
in
a
horrible
book
i
read
in
the
holidays
it
was
called
about
a
man
who
was
always
going
about
in
the
night
with
fixed
stony
eyes
and
appearing
on
the
tops
of
roofs
and
all
sorts
of
spooky
places
it
gives
me
the
creeps
to
think
of
it
ugh
when
people
walk
in
their
sleep
it
fearfully
dangerous
to
awaken
them
commented
daisy
is
it
why
oh
it
gives
them
such
a
terrible
shock
they
often
do
get
over
it
for
ages
you
ought
to
take
them
gently
by
the
hand
and
lead
them
back
to
bed
and
suppose
they
wo
go
ask
me
a
harder

a
sensation
look
here
said
betty
to
her
that
evening
those
poor
girls
in
no
are
just
yearning
for
a
sensation
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
philanthropic
and
supply
it
for
them
yearning
for
a
what
asked
marjorie
pausing
with
a
sponge
in
her
hand
and
reaching
for
the
towel
yearning
for
a
sensation
repeated
betty
life
at
an
ordinary
is
extremely
dull
daily
round
the
common
task
is
apt
to
pall
what
we
all
crave
for
is
change
and
especially
change
of
a
spicy
unexpected
sort
that
makes
you
jump
i
do
want
to
jump
thanks
perhaps
you
do
but
those
girls
in
no
do
they
longing
for
absolute
creeps
only
a
ghost
or
a
burglar
or
an
air
raid
or
something
really
stirring
would
content
them
i
afraid
they
have
to
go
discontented
then
certainly
not
as
i
remarked
before
we
ought
to
be
philanthropic
and
provide
a
little
entertainment
to
cheer
them
up
i
have
a
plan
proceed
o
queen
and
disclose
it
then
barbara
wright
suggested
it
to
me
not
intentionally
of
course
play
a
rag
on
them
one
of
us
must
pretend
to
and
go
into
their
room
it
ought
to
give
them
spasms
do
you
catch
on
rather
replied
the
others
but
who
going
to
do
the
business
asked
irene
marjorie
the
best
actress
we
leave
it
to
her
give
us
a
specimen
now
old
sport
and
show
us
how
you
do
it
oh
that
ripping
take
them
in
no
end
i
should
like
to
see
barbara
face
marjorie
was
always
perfectly
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
a
practical
joke
especially
if
it
were
a
new
variety
the
girls
had
grown
rather
tired
of
beds
or
nightdress
sleeves
but
nobody
had
yet
thought
of
somnambulism
i
not
going
to
stop
awake
again
though
until
twelve
she
objected
i
had
enough
of
it
last
night
it
somebody
else
turn
whoever
happens
to
wake
must
call
the
others
suggested
irene
we
leave
it
at
that
they
agreed
for
two
successive
nights
however
all
four
girls
slept
soundly
until
the
bell
rang
they
were
generally
tired
and
none
of
them
suffered
from
insomnia
on
the
third
night
betty
heard
the
clock
strike
two
and
going
into
marjorie
cubicle
tickled
her
awake
get
up
you
got
to
act
lady
macbeth
she
urged
best
opportunity
for
a
star
performance
you
ever
had
in
your
life
you
take
the
house
i
so
sleepy
yawned
marjorie
and
putting
one
foot
out
of
bed
it
so
beastly
cold
never
mind
the
fun
will
be
worth
it
we
going
to
wait
about
to
hear
them
squeal
it
be
precious
no
you
mus
put
on
your
and
bedroom
slippers
never
do
you
must
go
as
you
are
play
up
marjorie
decreed
the
others
who
were
also
awake
thus
encouraged
marjorie
rose
to
the
occasion
and
began
to
act
her
part
there
was
one
difficulty
to
be
overcome
at
night
a
lamp
was
left
burning
in
the
corridor
but
the
bedrooms
were
in
darkness
how
were
the
occupants
of
no
going
to
see
her
they
must
be
decoyed
somehow
from
their
beds
she
decided
to
open
the
door
of
their
room
so
as
to
let
in
a
little
light
then
enter
walk
round
their
cubicles
and
go
out
again
on
to
the
landing
where
she
hoped
they
would
follow
her
softly
she
entered
the
door
of
no
and
advanced
in
a
dramatic
attitude
with
outstretched
hands
in
imitation
of
a
picture
she
had
once
seen
of
lady
macbeth
the
light
from
the
corridor
though
dim
was
quite
sufficient
to
render
objects
distinct
at
the
first
stealthy
steps
daisy
shaw
awoke
promptly
her
shuddering
little
squeal
aroused
the
others
and
they
gazed
spellbound
at
the
figure
parading
in
ghostly
fashion
round
their
room
avoiding
the
furniture
marjorie
with
arms
still
outstretched
tacked
back
into
the
corridor
exactly
as
she
had
anticipated
the
girls
rose
and
followed
her
they
were
huddled
together
at
the
door
of
their
dormitory
watching
her
with
awestruck
faces
when
an
awful
thing
happened
another
door
opened
and
miss
norton
blue
and
bedroom
slippers
and
all
appeared
on
the
scene
what
the
matter
she
asked
sharply
marjorie
anderson
walking
in
her
sleep
whispered
the
girls
now
in
this
horrible
emergency
marjorie
had
to
act
promptly
or
not
at
all
she
decided
that
her
best
course
was
to
go
on
shamming
somnambulism
she
walked
down
the
corridor
therefore
with
a
rapid
stealthy
step
miss
norton
turned
on
the
frightened
girls
and
whispering
disturb
her
on
any
account
followed
in
the
wake
of
her
pupil
then
began
a
most
exciting
promenade
marjorie
with
eyes
set
in
a
stony
glare
marched
downstairs
into
the
hall
she
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
front
door
as
if
speculating
whether
to
unlock
it
or
not
she
could
hear
miss
norton
breathing
just
behind
her
and
was
almost
tempted
to
try
the
experiment
of
shooting
back
at
least
one
bolt
but
decided
it
was
wiser
not
to
run
the
risk
instead
she
walked
into
the
house
mistress
study
turned
over
a
few
papers
in
an
abstracted
fashion
threw
them
back
on
to
the
table
and
went
towards
the
window
here
again
miss
norton
shadowed
her
closely
evidently
suspecting
that
she
had
designs
of
opening
it
and
climbing
out
she
turned
round
however
and
with
apparently
unseeing
eyes
stared
in
the
teacher
face
and
stole
stealthily
back
up
the
stairs
at
her
own
bedroom
door
she
paused
in
seeming
uncertainty
as
to
whether
to
enter
or
not
miss
norton
laid
a
gentle
hand
on
her
arm
and
guided
her
quietly
into
her
room
and
towards
her
bed
marjorie
decided
to
take
the
hint
wandering
about
in
a
nightdress
with
bare
feet
was
a
very
cold
performance
and
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
prevent
herself
from
palpably
shivering
keeping
up
her
part
she
gave
a
gentle
little
sigh
got
into
bed
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
she
could
feel
miss
norton
pulling
the
clothes
over
her
and
with
another
quivering
sigh
she
sank
apparently
into
deepest
slumber
the
teacher
stayed
a
few
minutes
watching
her
then
as
she
never
moved
went
very
quietly
away
and
closed
the
door
after
her
nothing
was
said
at
next
morning
about
the
adventures
but
miss
norton
looked
rather
carefully
at
marjorie
asked
her
if
she
felt
well
and
told
her
she
was
to
go
to
nurse
hall
every
day
at
eleven
in
the
ambulance
room
for
a
dose
of
tonic
marjorie
who
had
not
intended
her
practical
joke
to
run
to
such
lengths
felt
rather
ashamed
of
herself
but
dared
not
confess
there
be
a
terrific
scene
if
norty
knew
she
said
to
betty
and
betty
agreed
with
her
in
the
afternoon
when
marjorie
ran
up
to
her
cubicle
for
a
to
her
surprise
she
found
morrison
there
superintending
a
man
who
was
measuring
the
window
she
wondered
why
for
nothing
apparently
was
wrong
with
it
but
nobody
dared
ask
questions
of
the
empress
so
she
took
her
clean
handkerchief
and
fled
later
on
that
day
she
learned
the
reason
we
to
have
brass
bars
across
our
window
sylvia
informed
her
i
heard
the
empress
and
the
acid
drop
talking
about
it
they
fearfully
expensive
in
but
the
empress
said
the
expense
can
not
be
helped
i
dare
risk
letting
the
poor
child
jump
through
the
window
her
door
must
certainly
be
locked
every
night
and
norty
said
it
a
very
dangerous
thing
are
they
putting
the
bars
up
for
me
exclaimed
marjorie
of
course
do
you
see
they
think
you
walk
in
your
sleep
and
might
kill
yourself
unless
you
protected
nice
thing
it
be
to
have
bars
across
our
window
and
our
door
locked
at
night
it
will
feel
like
prison
i
wish
to
goodness
you
never
played
such
a
trick
well
i
sure
you
all
wanted
me
to
it
was
my
idea
to
begin
with
retorted
marjorie
great
was
the
indignation
in
no
at
the
prospect
of
this
defacement
of
their
pretty
window
the
girls
talked
the
matter
over
something
got
to
be
done
said
betty
decidedly
illustration
they
were
huddled
together
watching
her
with
awestruck
faces
yes
groaned
marjorie
i
shall
have
to
own
up
there
nothing
else
for
it
but
i
not
going
to
tell
the
acid
drop
i
going
straight
to
the
empress
herself
she
be
the
more
decent
of
the
two
i
believe
you
right
agreed
betty
look
here
it
was
my
idea
so
i
going
with
you
and
i
was
in
it
too
said
irene
and
so
was
i
said
sylvia
then
we
all
four
go
in
a
body
decided
betty
come
along
beard
the
lioness
in
her
den
and
get
it
over
morrison
was
extremely
surprised
at
the
tale
the
girls
had
to
tell
she
frowned
but
looked
considerably
relieved
as
you
have
told
me
yourselves
i
will
let
it
pass
she
commented
but
you
must
each
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
there
shall
be
no
more
of
these
silly
practical
jokes
i
do
consider
it
at
all
clever
to
try
to
frighten
your
companions
jokes
such
as
these
sometimes
have
very
serious
results
will
you
each
promise
yes
morrison
on
my
honour
replied
four
meek
voices
in
chorus
chapter
ix
the
immediate
result
to
marjorie
of
her
mock
somnambulistic
adventure
was
that
she
got
a
very
bad
cold
in
her
head
due
no
doubt
to
walking
about
the
passages
with
bare
feet
and
only
her
nightdress
on
it
was
highly
aggravating
because
she
was
considered
an
invalid
and
her
wednesday
exeat
was
cancelled
she
had
to
watch
from
the
infirmary
window
when
dona
escorted
by
miss
jones
started
off
for
the
tamarisks
dona
waved
a
sympathetic
as
she
passed
she
was
a
little
soul
and
genuinely
sorry
for
marjorie
though
it
was
rather
a
treat
for
her
to
have
elaine
quite
to
herself
for
the
afternoon
anderson
had
been
justified
in
her
satisfaction
that
the
sisters
had
not
been
placed
in
the
same
hostel
in
marjorie
presence
dona
was
nothing
but
an
echo
or
a
shadow
with
no
personality
of
her
own
at
ethelberta
however
she
had
begun
in
her
quiet
way
to
make
a
place
for
herself
she
was
already
quite
a
favourite
among
her
they
teased
her
a
little
but
in
quite
a
fashion
and
dona
accustomed
to
the
continual
banter
of
a
large
family
took
all
chaffing
with
the
utmost
calm
she
was
happier
at
school
than
she
had
expected
to
be
miss
jones
the
hostel
mistress
was
genial
and
and
kept
well
in
touch
with
her
girls
she
talked
to
them
about
their
various
hobbies
and
was
herself
interested
in
so
many
different
things
that
she
could
give
valuable
hints
on
photography
bookbinding
stencilling
or
any
other
of
the
handicrafts
in
which
the
juniors
dabbled
she
was
artistic
and
had
done
quite
a
nice
pastel
portrait
of
belle
miller
whose
profile
and
auburn
hair
made
her
an
excellent
model
miss
jones
had
no
lack
of
sitters
when
she
felt
disposed
to
paint
for
every
girl
in
the
house
would
have
been
only
too
flattered
to
be
asked
dona
was
a
greater
success
in
her
hostel
than
in
the
schoolroom
after
her
easy
lessons
with
a
daily
governess
she
found
the
standard
of
her
form
extremely
high
she
was
not
fond
of
exerting
her
brains
and
her
exercises
were
generally
full
of
howlers
miss
clark
her
form
mistress
was
apt
to
wax
eloquent
over
her
mistakes
but
she
took
the
teacher
sarcasms
with
the
same
stolidity
as
the
girls
teasings
it
was
a
saying
in
the
class
that
nothing
could
knock
sparks
out
of
dona
yet
she
possessed
a
certain
reserve
of
shrewd
common
sense
which
was
sometimes
apt
to
astonish
people
if
she
took
the
trouble
to
evolve
a
plan
she
generally
succeeded
in
carrying
it
out
now
on
this
particular
afternoon
when
she
went
alone
to
the
tamarisks
she
had
a
very
special
scheme
in
her
head
she
had
struck
up
an
immensely
hot
friendship
with
a
scottish
girl
named
ailsa
donald
whose
tastes
resembled
her
own
dona
was
in
no
dormitory
and
ailsa
in
no
and
it
was
the
ambition
of
both
to
be
placed
together
in
adjoining
cubicles
miss
jones
sometimes
allowed
changes
to
be
made
but
as
it
happened
nobody
in
no
was
willing
to
give
up
her
bed
to
ailsa
or
in
no
to
yield
place
to
dona
so
the
chums
must
perforce
remain
apart
they
spent
every
available
moment
of
the
day
together
but
after
the
bell
they
separated
dona
had
asked
each
of
her
to
consider
whether
no
was
not
really
a
more
sunny
airy
and
comfortable
bedroom
than
no
the
are
bigger
she
urged
to
mona
kenworthy
have
far
more
room
to
spread
out
your
bottles
of
scent
and
hairwash
and
cremolia
and
things
thanks
i
plenty
of
room
where
i
am
and
my
things
are
all
nicely
settled
i
not
going
to
move
for
anybody
and
that
flat
returned
mona
dona
next
tackled
nellie
mason
and
suggested
warily
that
no
being
farther
away
from
miss
jones
bedroom
afforded
greater
opportunities
for
laughter
and
jokes
without
so
much
danger
of
being
pounced
upon
her
fish
however
refused
to
swallow
the
tempting
bait
and
beatrice
elliot
whom
she
also
sounded
on
the
subject
was
equally
inflexible
most
girls
would
have
accepted
the
inevitable
but
dona
was
not
to
be
vanquished
she
had
a
dark
plan
at
the
bottom
of
her
mind
and
consulted
elaine
about
it
that
afternoon
elaine
laughed
waxed
enthusiastic
and
suggested
a
visit
to
a
shop
down
in
the
town
it
was
a
queer
little
place
with
cages
full
of
canaries
in
the
window
and
an
aquarium
and
some
delightful
puppies
and
persian
kittens
on
sale
also
a
squirrel
which
was
running
round
and
round
in
a
kind
of
revolving
wheel
elaine
and
dona
entered
and
asked
for
white
mice
mice
said
the
old
man
in
charge
i
got
a
pair
here
that
will
just
suit
you
they
real
beauties
they
are
tame
they
eat
off
your
hand
look
here
he
fumbled
under
the
counter
and
brought
out
a
cage
from
which
he
produced
two
fine
and
plump
specimens
of
the
mouse
tribe
they
justified
his
eulogy
for
they
allowed
dona
to
handle
them
and
stroke
them
without
exhibiting
any
signs
of
fear
or
displeasure
suppose
i
were
to
let
them
run
about
the
room
she
enquired
could
i
get
them
back
into
their
cage
again
easy
as
anything
missie
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
put
a
bit
of
cheese
inside
they
smell
it
directly
and
come
running
home
and
then
you
shut
the
door
on
them
they
do
anything
for
cheese
give
them
plenty
of
sawdust
to
burrow
in
and
some
to
make
a
nest
and
they
perfectly
happy
shall
i
wrap
the
cage
up
in
brown
paper
for
you
dona
issued
from
the
shop
carrying
her
parcel
and
with
a
bland
smile
upon
her
face
if
these
do
clear
mona
out
of
no
i
do
know
what
will
she
chuckled
how
are
you
going
to
smuggle
them
in
to
brackenfield
enquired
elaine
i
think
all
parcels
that
you
take
in
are
examined
you
ca
put
a
cage
of
mice
in
your
pocket
or
under
your
skirt
i
thought
of
that
returned
dona
you
and
auntie
are
going
to
take
me
back
i
shall
pop
the
parcel
under
a
laurel
bush
as
we
go
up
the
drive
then
before
supper
i
manage
to
dash
out
and
get
it
and
take
it
upstairs
to
my
room
see
i
think
you
a
thoroughly
naughty
schemeing
girl
laughed
elaine
and
that
i
ought
to
be
conniving
at
such
shameful
tricks
shakespeare
tells
us
that
some
can
not
abide
a
gaping
pig
nor
some
the
harmless
necessary
cat
many
people
have
their
pet
dislikes
and
as
to
mona
kenworthy
the
very
mention
of
mice
sent
a
series
of
cold
shivers
down
her
back
suppose
one
were
to
run
up
my
skirt
i
have
a
fit
i
really
should
die
she
would
declare
dramatically
the
thought
of
them
makes
me
absolutely
creep
i
should
mind
them
so
much
if
they
did
scuttle
so
hard
black
beetles
oh
i
rather
have
cockroaches
any
day
than
mice
it
was
with
the
knowledge
of
this
aversion
on
the
part
of
mona
that
dona
laid
her
plans
she
left
the
cage
under
the
laurel
bush
in
the
drive
and
by
great
good
luck
succeeded
in
fetching
it
unobserved
and
conveying
it
to
her
dormitory
where
she
unwrapped
it
and
stowed
it
away
in
her
wardrobe
when
she
had
undressed
that
evening
and
just
before
the
lights
were
turned
out
she
placed
the
cage
under
her
bed
she
waited
until
miss
clark
had
made
her
usual
tour
of
inspection
and
the
door
of
the
room
was
shut
for
the
night
then
leaning
over
she
opened
the
cage
and
allowed
its
occupants
to
escape
they
made
full
use
of
their
liberty
and
at
once
began
to
scamper
about
investigate
the
premises
and
enjoy
themselves
what
that
said
mona
sitting
up
in
bed
dona
did
not
reply
she
pretended
to
be
asleep
already
it
sounds
like
a
mouse
volunteered
nellie
mason
oh
good
gracious
i
hope
it
not
in
the
room
the
old
saying
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
is
not
always
justified
in
solid
fact
on
this
occasion
the
two
small
intruders
made
as
much
noise
as
tigers
they
began
to
gnaw
the
skirting
board
and
the
sound
of
their
sharp
little
teeth
echoed
through
the
room
mona
waxed
quite
hysterical
if
it
runs
over
my
bed
i
shall
shriek
she
declared
perhaps
it
not
really
in
the
room
it
probably
in
the
wainscot
suggested
beatrice
elliot
i
tell
you
i
heard
it
run
across
the
floor
oh
i
say
there
it
is
again
the
frolicsome
pair
continued
their
revels
for
some
time
and
kept
the
girls
wide
awake
when
mona
fell
asleep
at
last
it
was
with
her
head
buried
under
the
very
early
in
the
morning
dona
got
up
tempted
her
pets
back
with
some
cheese
which
she
had
brought
from
the
tamarisks
and
put
the
cage
into
her
wardrobe
again
directly
after
breakfast
mona
went
to
miss
jones
and
on
the
plea
that
her
bed
was
so
near
the
window
that
she
constantly
took
cold
and
suffered
from
toothache
begged
leave
to
exchange
quarters
with
ailsa
donald
who
had
a
liking
for
draughts
and
was
willing
to
move
out
of
no
into
no
miss
jones
was
accommodating
enough
to
grant
permission
and
the
two
girls
transferred
their
belongings
without
delay
i
would
sleep
another
night
in
that
dormitory
for
anything
you
could
offer
me
confided
mona
to
her
particular
chum
kathleen
drummond
i
simply
ca
tell
you
what
i
suffered
i
very
sensitive
about
mice
i
get
it
from
my
mother
neither
of
us
can
bear
them
you
might
have
set
a
trap
suggested
kathleen
but
think
of
hearing
it
go
off
and
catch
the
mouse
no
i
never
could
feel
happy
in
no
again
miss
jones
is
an
absolute
darling
to
let
me
change
dona
share
in
the
matter
was
not
suspected
by
anybody
her
plot
had
succeeded
admirably
her
only
anxiety
was
what
to
do
with
the
mice
for
she
could
not
keep
them
as
permanent
tenants
of
her
wardrobe
the
risk
of
discovery
was
great
fortunately
she
managed
to
secure
the
good
offices
of
a
friendly
housemaid
who
carried
away
the
cage
and
promised
to
present
the
mice
to
her
young
brother
when
she
went
for
her
night
out
to
whitecliffe
to
nobody
but
ailsa
did
dona
confide
the
trick
she
had
played
and
ailsa
being
of
scottish
birth
could
keep
a
secret
chapter
x
the
red
cross
hospital
there
was
just
one
more
exeat
for
marjorie
and
dona
before
the
holidays
christmas
was
near
now
and
they
were
looking
forward
immensely
to
returning
home
they
had
on
the
whole
enjoyed
the
term
but
the
time
had
seemed
long
and
to
dona
especially
the
last
weeks
dragged
interminably
i
counting
every
day
and
crossing
it
off
in
my
calendar
she
said
to
marjorie
as
the
two
stepped
along
towards
the
tamarisks
getting
so
fearfully
excited
just
think
of
seeing
mother
and
peter
and
cyril
and
joan
again
and
there
always
the
hope
that
daddy
might
get
leave
and
come
home
oh
it
would
be
splendiferous
if
he
did
i
suppose
there
no
chance
for
any
of
the
boys
they
did
seem
to
think
it
likely
returned
marjorie
bevis
certainly
said
he
have
no
leave
till
the
spring
and
leonard
expect
his
either
larry
may
have
a
few
days
but
you
know
he
said
we
must
count
upon
it
oh
dear
i
suppose
not
i
should
have
liked
larry
to
be
home
for
christmas
i
wish
they
send
him
to
the
camp
near
whitecliffe
he
promised
he
come
and
take
me
out
and
give
me
tea
at
a
café
it
would
be
such
fun
i
want
to
go
to
that
new
café
that
just
been
opened
in
king
street
it
looks
so
nice
perhaps
we
can
coax
elaine
to
take
us
there
this
afternoon
suggested
marjorie
but
when
the
girls
reached
the
tamarisks
their
cousin
had
quite
a
different
plan
for
their
entertainment
we
going
to
the
red
cross
hospital
she
announced
i
always
promised
to
show
you
over
only
it
was
never
convenient
before
a
great
day
the
men
are
to
have
their
christmas
tree
before
christmas
exclaimed
dona
why
yes
it
does
much
matter
the
reason
is
that
some
very
grand
people
can
come
over
to
be
present
so
of
course
our
commandant
seized
the
opportunity
it
lord
and
lady
greystones
and
admiral
webster
there
be
speeches
you
know
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
it
please
the
tommies
oh
here
grace
she
going
with
me
one
of
our
grace
may
i
introduce
my
two
cousins
marjorie
and
dona
anderson
this
is
miss
chalmers
both
elaine
and
her
friend
were
dressed
in
their
neat
uniforms
marjorie
scanned
them
with
admiring
and
envious
eyes
as
the
four
girls
set
off
together
for
the
hospital
i
just
love
to
be
a
she
sighed
oh
i
wish
i
were
old
enough
to
leave
school
it
must
be
a
ripping
life
grace
chalmers
laughed
one
does
always
think
so
early
in
the
morning
sometimes
i
give
everything
in
the
world
not
to
have
to
get
up
and
turn
out
so
would
i
agreed
elaine
what
exactly
has
a
to
do
asked
marjorie
do
tell
me
well
it
depends
entirely
on
the
hospital
and
what
she
has
undertaken
if
she
has
signed
under
government
then
she
a
nurse
and
is
sent
to
one
of
the
big
hospitals
elaine
and
i
are
only
we
go
in
the
mornings
from
eight
till
one
and
do
odd
jobs
i
took
night
duty
during
the
summer
while
some
of
the
staff
had
their
holidays
was
it
hard
to
keep
awake
not
in
the
least
do
imagine
for
a
moment
that
night
duty
consists
in
sitting
in
a
ward
and
trying
not
to
go
to
sleep
i
was
busy
all
the
time
i
had
to
get
the
trays
ready
for
breakfast
and
cut
the
bread
and
butter
have
you
ever
cut
bread
and
butter
for
fifty
hungry
people
i
helped
to
get
ready
for
a
said
marjorie
well
this
is
like
a
every
day
one
night
i
had
to
clean
fifty
herrings
they
were
sent
as
a
present
in
a
little
barrel
and
the
commandant
said
the
men
should
have
them
for
breakfast
they
had
been
cleaned
so
violet
linwood
and
i
set
to
work
upon
them
it
was
a
most
horrible
job
my
hands
smelt
of
fish
for
days
afterwards
i
mind
though
as
it
was
for
the
tommies
they
enjoyed
their
fried
herrings
immensely
what
else
did
i
have
to
do
in
the
night
when
the
breakfast
trays
were
ready
i
used
to
disinfect
my
hands
and
sterilize
the
scissors
and
then
make
swabs
for
next
day
dressings
some
of
the
men
do
sleep
well
and
i
often
had
to
look
after
them
and
do
things
for
them
then
early
in
the
morning
we
woke
our
patients
and
washed
them
and
gave
them
their
breakfasts
and
made
their
beds
and
tidied
their
lockers
and
by
that
time
the
had
arrived
and
we
went
off
duty
tell
her
how
you
paddled
chuckled
elaine
shall
i
is
it
rather
naughty
oh
please
implored
marjorie
and
dona
who
were
both
deeply
interested
well
you
see
there
generally
rather
a
slack
time
between
four
and
and
one
morning
it
was
quite
light
and
most
deliciously
warm
and
sister
was
on
duty
in
the
ward
and
violet
and
i
were
only
waiting
about
downstairs
so
we
stole
out
and
rushed
down
to
the
beach
and
paddled
it
was
gorgeous
the
sea
looked
so
lovely
in
that
early
morning
light
and
it
was
so
cool
and
refreshing
to
go
in
the
water
and
of
course
there
was
a
soul
about
we
had
the
beach
all
to
ourselves
we
were
back
again
long
before
sister
wanted
us
what
do
you
do
in
the
asked
marjorie
i
in
the
kitchen
mostly
helping
to
prepare
dinner
i
peel
potatoes
and
cut
up
carrots
and
stir
the
milk
puddings
elaine
is
on
ward
duty
now
she
tell
you
what
she
does
help
to
take
temperatures
and
chart
them
said
elaine
then
there
are
instruments
to
sterilize
and
lotions
to
mix
and
somebody
has
to
get
the
day
orders
from
the
dispensary
and
and
if
you
forget
anything
there
a
row
dressings
are
going
on
practically
all
the
morning
sometimes
there
are
operations
and
we
have
to
clean
up
afterwards
i
like
being
on
ward
duty
better
than
kitchen
it
far
more
interesting
it
a
business
when
there
a
new
convoy
in
remarked
grace
rather
agreed
elaine
the
ambulances
arrive
and
life
unbearable
till
all
the
men
are
settled
they
have
to
be
entered
in
the
books
with
every
detail
down
to
their
diets
they
so
glad
when
they
get
to
their
quarters
poor
fellows
the
journey
an
awful
trial
to
some
of
them
here
we
are
now
you
be
able
to
see
everything
for
yourselves
the
red
cross
hospital
was
a
large
fine
house
in
a
breezy
situation
on
the
cliffs
it
had
been
lent
for
the
purpose
by
its
owner
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
had
been
adapted
with
very
little
alteration
and
had
been
turned
into
wards
the
library
was
an
office
and
the
best
bedroom
an
a
wooden
hut
had
been
erected
in
the
garden
as
a
for
convalescents
in
the
grounds
were
full
of
where
the
men
could
sit
and
enjoy
the
beautiful
view
over
the
sea
everybody
was
collected
in
queen
mary
ward
about
sixteen
patients
were
in
bed
others
had
been
brought
in
wheeled
chairs
and
a
large
number
who
were
fairly
convalescent
sat
on
benches
the
room
looked
very
bright
and
cheerful
there
were
pots
of
ferns
and
flowers
on
the
tables
and
the
walls
had
been
decorated
for
the
occasion
with
flags
and
evergreens
and
patriotic
mottoes
in
a
large
tub
in
the
centre
stood
the
christmas
tree
ornamented
with
coloured
glass
balls
and
tiny
flags
some
of
the
parcels
tied
up
with
scarlet
ribbons
were
hanging
from
the
branches
but
the
greater
number
were
piled
underneath
marjorie
looked
round
with
tremendous
interest
she
had
never
before
been
inside
a
hospital
of
any
kind
and
a
military
one
particularly
appealed
to
her
each
of
the
patients
had
fought
at
the
front
and
had
been
wounded
for
his
king
and
his
country
england
owed
them
a
debt
of
gratitude
and
nothing
that
could
be
done
seemed
too
much
to
repay
it
her
thoughts
flew
to
bevis
leonard
and
larry
would
they
ever
be
brought
to
a
place
like
this
and
nursed
by
strangers
you
like
to
go
round
and
see
some
of
the
tommies
would
you
asked
elaine
marjorie
agreed
with
enthusiasm
and
dona
less
cordially
the
latter
silly
little
goose
was
always
scared
at
the
idea
of
wounds
and
hospitals
and
she
was
feeling
somewhat
sick
and
faint
at
the
sight
of
so
many
invalids
though
she
did
not
dare
to
confess
such
foolishness
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
she
allowed
marjorie
to
go
first
and
followed
with
rather
white
cheeks
she
was
so
accustomed
to
play
second
fiddle
that
nobody
noticed
the
patients
were
looking
very
cheerful
and
smiled
broadly
on
their
visitors
they
were
evidently
accustomed
to
being
shown
off
by
their
nurses
some
were
shy
and
would
say
nothing
but
yes
no
or
thank
you
and
others
were
conversational
elaine
introduced
them
like
a
proud
little
mother
this
is
peters
he
keeps
us
all
alive
in
this
ward
he
lost
his
right
leg
but
he
going
on
very
well
and
takes
it
sporting
do
you
peters
rather
nurse
replied
peters
a
freckled
young
fellow
of
about
only
i
wish
it
had
been
the
other
leg
you
see
he
explained
to
the
visitors
my
right
leg
was
fractured
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
i
was
eighteen
months
in
hospital
with
it
at
harpenden
and
they
were
very
proud
of
making
me
walk
again
then
soon
after
i
got
back
to
the
front
it
was
blown
off
and
i
felt
wasted
their
time
over
it
at
harpenden
it
was
too
bad
sympathized
marjorie
jackson
has
lost
his
right
leg
too
said
elaine
passing
on
to
the
next
bed
he
was
wounded
on
sentry
duty
he
been
out
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
had
not
had
a
scratch
till
then
and
been
promised
his
leave
the
very
next
day
hard
luck
was
it
the
only
thing
that
troubles
me
remarked
jackson
is
that
i
paid
a
quid
out
in
egypt
to
have
my
leg
tattooed
by
one
of
those
black
fellows
he
put
a
camel
on
it
and
a
bird
and
a
monkey
and
my
initials
and
a
heart
it
was
something
to
look
at
was
that
leg
and
i
left
it
over
in
france
wish
i
could
get
my
money
back
the
next
patient
rawlins
was
very
shy
and
would
not
speak
though
he
smiled
a
little
at
the
visitors
he
going
on
nicely
explained
elaine
but
i
afraid
he
still
suffers
a
good
deal
he
awfully
plucky
about
it
he
does
care
to
talk
he
likes
just
to
lie
and
watch
what
going
on
in
the
ward
this
boy
in
the
next
bed
is
most
amusing
he
sends
everyone
into
fits
only
eighteen
poor
lad
webster
here
are
two
young
ladies
come
to
see
you
do
you
know
he
can
imitate
animals
absolutely
perfectly
give
us
a
specimen
webster
before
lord
and
lady
greystones
arrive
i
a
bashful
sort
of
a
chap
began
the
boy
humorously
no
no
you
not
put
in
elaine
i
want
my
cousins
to
hear
the
pig
squeak
please
do
well
to
oblige
you
nurse
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
his
elbow
then
to
the
girls
surprise
a
whole
seemed
to
have
entered
the
ward
they
could
hear
a
sheep
bleating
a
duck
quacking
a
dog
barking
hens
clucking
a
cock
crowing
and
a
pig
uttering
a
series
of
agonized
squeals
it
was
a
most
comical
imitation
and
really
very
clever
even
dona
laughed
heartily
and
the
colour
crept
back
to
her
cheeks
she
was
beginning
to
get
over
her
terror
of
wounded
soldiers
they
seem
to
be
able
to
enjoy
themselves
she
remarked
oh
yes
they
all
sorts
of
amusement
replied
elaine
drawing
her
cousins
aside
it
wonderful
how
cheery
they
keep
not
to
say
noisy
sometimes
in
ward
the
men
have
mouth
organs
and
tin
whistles
and
combs
and
play
till
you
nearly
deafened
we
do
like
to
check
them
if
it
keeps
up
their
spirits
poor
fellows
you
see
there
always
such
a
pathetic
side
to
it
some
of
them
will
be
cripples
to
the
end
of
their
days
and
they
still
so
young
it
seems
dreadful
think
of
peters
and
jackson
a
man
with
one
leg
ca
do
very
much
for
a
living
unless
he
a
clerk
and
neither
of
them
is
educated
enough
for
that
their
pensions
wo
be
very
much
i
suppose
they
be
taught
some
kind
of
handicraft
i
hope
so
at
any
rate
are
they
all
ordinary
tommies
here
asked
marjorie
we
no
officers
they
of
course
are
always
in
a
separate
hospital
but
some
of
the
tommies
are
gentlemen
and
have
been
to
public
schools
there
are
two
over
there
we
go
down
the
other
side
of
the
ward
and
you
see
them
there
just
time
before
our
grand
visitors
arrive
we
must
stop
and
say
a
word
at
each
bed
or
the
men
will
feel
left
out
we
try
not
to
show
any
favouritism
to
the
gentlemen
tommies
this
is
wilkinson
he
reads
the
newspaper
through
every
day
and
tells
us
all
about
it
it
very
convenient
when
we
have
time
to
read
it
for
ourselves
this
is
davis
he
comes
from
bangor
and
can
speak
welsh
which
is
more
than
i
can
this
is
harper
he
to
get
up
next
week
if
he
goes
on
all
right
who
is
this
in
the
next
bed
asked
marjorie
suddenly
seventeen
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
tommies
whispered
elaine
an
old
rugby
boy
he
knew
wilfred
there
yes
sister
i
coming
in
response
to
a
word
from
the
ward
sister
elaine
hurried
away
immediately
leaving
her
cousins
to
take
care
of
themselves
marjorie
looked
again
at
the
patient
in
no
the
twinkling
brown
eyes
seemed
most
familiar
she
glanced
at
the
board
on
the
and
saw
hilton
tamworthy
preston
the
humorous
mouth
was
smiling
at
her
in
evident
recognition
she
smiled
too
did
we
travel
together
from
silverwood
she
stammered
of
course
we
did
i
knew
you
at
once
when
you
were
going
down
the
other
side
of
the
ward
he
replied
did
you
get
to
brackenfield
all
right
that
day
yes
thanks
but
how
did
you
know
that
we
were
going
to
brackenfield
why
you
were
wearing
your
badges
my
sisters
used
to
be
there
so
i
twigged
at
once
that
you
were
brackenfielders
your
teacher
wore
a
badge
too
i
hope
she
found
a
taxi
all
right
no
she
did
it
was
a
wretched
but
we
were
glad
to
get
anything
in
the
way
of
a
cab
how
do
you
like
school
oh
pretty
well
i
like
it
better
than
dona
does
we
going
home
next
tuesday
for
the
holidays
my
sisters
were
very
happy
there
and
kathleen
was
a
prefect
i
used
to
hear
all
about
it
do
you
still
call
morrison
empress
i
expect
there
are
plenty
of
new
girls
now
that
joyce
and
kathleen
would
remember
have
you
been
wounded
asked
dona
shyly
yes
but
i
getting
on
splendidly
i
hope
to
be
up
quite
soon
the
doctor
promised
to
have
me
back
at
the
front
before
long
we
have
a
brother
at
the
front
and
one
on
the
and
another
in
training
volunteered
marjorie
besides
father
who
at
havre
and
i
one
of
five
brothers
who
are
all
fighting
did
you
get
the
oh
yes
but
i
do
think
i
did
anything
very
particular
any
of
our
men
would
have
done
the
same
have
you
got
it
here
in
your
locker
no
my
mother
has
it
at
home
i
have
loved
to
see
it
i
wish
i
could
have
shown
it
to
you
i
thought
it
would
be
safer
at
home
hallo
here
come
the
bigwigs
the
show
is
going
to
begin
all
eyes
turned
towards
the
door
where
the
commandant
was
ushering
in
the
guests
of
the
afternoon
lord
greystones
was
elderly
with
a
white
moustache
and
a
bald
head
lady
greystones
twenty
years
younger
was
pretty
and
handsomely
dressed
in
velvet
and
furs
admiral
webster
like
nelson
had
lost
an
arm
and
his
empty
sleeve
was
tucked
into
the
coat
front
of
his
uniform
the
patients
saluted
as
the
visitors
entered
and
those
who
were
able
stood
up
but
the
majority
had
perforce
to
remain
seated
escorted
by
the
commandant
the
august
visitors
first
made
a
tour
of
inspection
round
the
ward
nodding
or
saying
a
few
words
to
the
patients
in
bed
speeches
followed
from
lord
greystones
and
the
admiral
and
from
one
of
the
governors
of
the
hospital
they
were
stirring
patriotic
speeches
and
marjorie
listened
with
a
little
thrill
and
wished
more
than
ever
that
she
were
old
enough
to
take
some
real
part
in
the
war
and
bear
a
share
of
the
nation
burden
it
was
wonderful
as
the
admiral
said
to
think
that
we
are
living
in
history
and
that
the
deeds
done
at
this
present
time
will
go
down
through
all
the
years
while
the
british
empire
lasts
then
came
the
important
business
of
stripping
the
tree
lord
greystones
and
the
admiral
cut
off
the
parcels
and
lady
greystones
distributed
them
to
the
men
with
a
pleasant
word
and
a
smile
for
each
the
presents
consisted
mostly
of
tobacco
or
little
with
notepaper
and
envelopes
it
so
fearfully
hard
to
know
what
to
choose
for
them
said
elaine
who
had
found
her
way
back
to
her
cousins
it
no
use
giving
them
things
they
ca
take
away
with
them
a
few
of
them
like
books
but
very
few
oh

help
me
to
take
them

you
like
the
convalescents

to
have
tea

the
they
a
simply
enormous
cake
you
must
go
and
look
at
it
it
disappear
to
the
last
crumb
here
mother
she
take
you
with
her
and
see
you
back
to

a
moment
and

hurriedly

much

chapter
xi
a
stolen
meeting
at
the
very
first
available
moment
marjorie
went
to
the
library
and
consulted
the
latest
number
of
the
school
she
turned
to
the
directory
of
past
girls
at
the
end
and
sought
the
letter
here
she
found
preston
kathleen
hilary
the
manor
preston
joyce
benson
wildeswood
yorks
each
here
for
three
years
she
soliloquized

up
in
the
of
friends
this
is
it
preston
has
been
doing
canteen
work
in

under
the
croix
rouge
française
at
a
military
station

run
by
english
women
for
french
soldiers
and

a
specially
busy
one
the

in
the
north
of

and
she
says

brackenfield

am
sure
they
would
love
it
joyce

to
get
up
a
very
excellent
concert
for
the
soldiers
in
the
red
cross
hospital
at
chadley
the
evening
being
an
immense
success
enterprising
girls
thought
marjorie
those
are
just
the
sort
of
things
i
want
to
do
when
i
leave
school
i
like
kathleen
best
because
she
drives
an
ambulance
wagon
i
wish

knew
them
i
write
to
them
and
tell
them

seen
their
brother
in
hospital
only
they
think
it
cheek
they
must
feel
proud
of
him

the
i
know
how
i
should
if
one
of
our
brothers
won
it
oh

we
have
seen
leonard
or
bevis
for
nine
months
it
hard
to
have
one
brothers
out
at
the
war
i
wonder
what
convalescent
home
private
preston
will
be
sent
to
i
must
ask
elaine
next
morning
when
marjorie
met
dona
at
the
eleven
break
she
found
the
latter
in
a
state
of
much
excitement
i
had
a
line
from
mother
enclosing
a
letter
from
larry
she
announced
this
is
what
he
says
old
bunting
hope

on
all
serene
at

and
spoilt
the
carpets
with
salt
tears
i

promised

your
head

to
squibs
and
your
little
self
affectionate
oh
i
say
what
gorgeous
fun
exclaimed
marjorie
so
he
sent
to
the
denley
camp
after
all
it
just
on
the
other
side
of
whitecliffe
how
absolutely
topping
to
go
out
to
tea
with
larry
i
hope
he
get
leave
the
girls
confided
their
exciting
news
to
their
and
their
most
intimate
friends
with
the
result
that
on
saturday
afternoon
at
least
sixteen
heads
were
peeping
out
of
windows
on
the
qui
vive
to
see
the
interesting
visitor
arrive
when
a
figure
in
khaki
strode
up
the
drive
and
rang
the
bell
the
event
was
signalled
from
one
hostel
to
another
now
morrison
was
very
faithful
to
her
duties
as
principal
and
during
rarely
allowed
herself
a
holiday
but
it
happened
on
this
particular
saturday
that
she
went
for
the
day
to
visit
friends
and
appointed
miss
norton
deputy
in
her
absence
larry
anderson
was
shown
by
the
into
the
where
parents
were
generally
received
and
left
there
to
wait
while
his
presence
was
announced
after
an
interval
of
about
ten
minutes
during
which
he
studied
the
photographs
of
the
school
teams
that
ornamented
the
mantelpiece
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
fair
lady
with
eyes
and
entered
morrison
i
presume
he
enquired
courteously
i
am
miss
norton
was
the
reply
morrison
is
away
and
has
left
me
in
charge
can
i
do
anything
for
you
i
come
to
see
my
sisters
marjorie
and
dona
anderson
and
to
ask
if
i
may
take
them
in
to
whitecliffe
for
an
hour
or
so
i
sorry
freezingly
but
that
is
quite
impossible
it
is
against
the
rules
of
the
school
yes
of
course
i
know
they
not
usually
allowed
out
but
the
mater
i
mean
my
mother
wrote
to
morrison
to
ask
her
to
let
the
girls
go
morrison
left
me
no
instructions
on
the
subject
but
did
she
give
you
my
mother
letter
she
did
not
or
leave
it
on
her
desk
or
something
ca
you
find
out
i
certainly
can
not
search
my
principal
correspondence
returned
miss
norton
very
stiffly
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
brackenfield
that
no
pupil
is
allowed
out
without
a
special
exeat
and
in
the
circumstances
i
have
no
power
to
grant
this
but
oh
i
say
the
girls
will
be
so
awfully
disappointed
i
am
sorry
but
it
can
not
be
helped
well
i
suppose
i
may
see
them
here
for
half
an
hour
that
also
is
out
of
the
question
our
rule
is
visitors
except
parents
unless
by
special
permission
but
the
permission
is
in
my
mother
letter
neither
letter
nor
permission
was
handed
to
me
by
mrs
morrison
excuse
me
when
i
come
all
this
way
surely
i
may
see
my
sisters
i
have
said
already
that
it
is
impossible
replied
miss
norton
rising
i
am
in
charge
of
the
school
and
must
do
my
duty
your
sisters
will
be
returning
home
next
tuesday
after
which
you
can
make
your
own
arrangements
for
meeting
them
while
they
are
under
my
care
i
do
not
allow
visitors
miss
norton
was
a
martinet
where
school
rules
were
concerned
and
the
brackenfield
code
was
strict
she
knew
that
morrison
would
at
least
have
allowed
marjorie
and
dona
to
see
their
brother
in
the
but
in
the
absence
of
instructions
to
that
effect
she
chose
to
keep
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
refuse
all
male
visitors
larry
with
an
effort
kept
his
temper
he
was
extremely
annoyed
and
disappointed
but
he
did
not
forget
that
he
was
a
gentleman
then
i
will
not
trouble
you
further
and
must
apologize
for
interrupting
you
he
said
stiffly
but
courteously
i
am
afraid
i
have
trespassed
upon
your
time
please
do
not
mention
it
answered
miss
norton
with
equal
politeness
they
parted
on
terms
of
icy
civility
larry
however
was
not
to
be
entirely
defeated
he
had
only
left
haileybury
six
months
before
and
there
was
still
much
of
the
schoolboy
in
him
he
was
determined
to
find
a
way
to
see
his
sisters
he
paused
a
moment
on
the
steps
after
the
maid
had
shown
him
out
and
taking
a
notebook
from
his
pocket
hastily
scribbled
a
few
lines
then
noticing
some
girls
with
hockey
sticks
crossing
the
quadrangle
he
went
up
to
them
and
handing
the
note
to
the
one
whose
looks
he
considered
the
most
encouraging
said
may
i
ask
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
give
this
to
my
sister
dona
anderson
it
very
important
then
he
walked
away
down
the
drive
meantime
marjorie
and
dona
had
been
waiting
in
momentary
expectation
of
a
call
to
the
they
could
hardly
believe
the
bad
news
when
scouts
informed
them
that
their
brother
had
left
without
seeing
them
gone
away
echoed
dona
almost
in
tears
but
why
who
sent
him
away
demanded
marjorie
indignantly
at
this
crisis
mena
matthews
hurried
in
with
the
note
dona
read
it
with
marjorie
looking
over
her
shoulder
it
ran
dear
old
bunting
your
schoolmistress
guards
you
like
nuns
but
i
must
see
you
and
squibs
somehow
can
you
manage
to
peep
over
the
wall
side
of
gate
i
walk
up
and
down
the
road
for
half
an
hour
on
the
chance
yours
larry
there
was
a
hockey
match
that
afternoon
between
the
second
and
third
teams
and
all
the
school
was
making
its
way
in
the
direction
of
the
within
the
next
minute
however
marjorie
and
dona
with
a
select
escort
of
friends
to
act
as
scouts
had
reached
the
garden
wall
and
were
climbing
up
with
an
agility
that
would
have
delighted
their
gymnasium
mistress
could
she
have
witnessed
the
performance
larry
in
the
road
below
grinned
as
the
two
familiar
heads
appeared
above
the
coping
it
is
safe
to
talk
here
called
marjorie
go
down
that
side
lane
till
you
come
to
some
wooden
palings
we
cut
across
the
plantation
and
meet
you
there
all
serene
laughed
larry
hugely
enjoying
the
joke
the
school
grounds
were
large
covering
many
acres
and
a
private
road
led
down
the
side
towards
the
kitchen
garden
larry
found
his
sisters
already
ensconced
on
the
palings
looking
out
for
him
i
say
this
is
rather
the
limit
is
it
he
greeted
them
the
mater
wrote
and
said
i
might
take
you
to
whitecliffe
and
that
icicle
in
the
would
even
so
much
as
let
me
have
a
glimpse
of
you
is
this
place
you
got
to
a
convent
are
you
both
required
to
take
the
veil
please
not
just
yet
but
what
happened
asked
marjorie
mena
says
the
empress
is
out
this
afternoon
whom
did
you
see
a
grim
gorgon
in
glasses
who
withered
me
with
a
look
the
acid
drop
surely
probably
she
certainly
was
sweet
and
she
would
let
us
go
wailed
dona
no
poor
old
baby
bunting
it
a
rotten
business
is
it
no
dragon
in
a
fairy
tale
could
have
guarded
the
princess
more
closely
if
stayed
any
longer
she
have
thrust
talons
into
me
oh
it
too
bad
and
you
promised
to
take
me
to
have
tea
at
a
café
so
i
did
i
meant
to
give
you
a
regular
so
far
as
the
rationing
order
would
allow
us
look
here
old
sport
i
ever
so
sorry
if
i
only
foreseen
this
i
have
brought
some
cakes
and
sweets
for
you
i
afraid
i
nothing
in
my
pockets
except
cigarettes
and
a
cough
lozenge
cheer
oh
it
christmas
holidays
next
week
and
you
be
tucking
into
turkey
before
long
how

marjorie
we
have
a
wooden
hut
to
sleep
in
there
are
thirty
of
us
we
each
have
three
planks
on
trestles
for
a
bed
and
a
palliasse
to
put
on
it
at
night
and
a
straw
pillow
we
get
four
blankets
apiece
i
make
my
own
bed
every
night
double
one
blanket
underneath
and
roll
the
others
round
me
and
have
my
greatcoat
on
top
if
i
cold
aunt
ellinor
has
lent
me
an
and
it
a
great
boon
because
the
straw
pillow
is
as
hard
as
a
brick
we
do
route
marches
and
and
yesterday
i
was
on
scout
duty
and
three
of
us
captured
a
sentry
if
we
been
at
the
front
instead
of
only
training
he
have
shot
me
certain
do
you
have
to
learn
to
be
a
soldier
asked
dona
why
of
course
you
little
innocent
that
what
the
is
for
to
teach
us
how
to
scout
and
dig
trenches
and
all
the
rest
of
it
oh
i
thought
you
just
went
to
the
front
and
fought
it
would
be
a
queer
war
if
we
did
are
you
coming
home
for
christmas
no
i
ca
get
leave
i
only
wish
i
could
cave
called
ailsa
donald
the
nearest
in
the
line
of
girls
who
had
undertaken
to
keep
guard
miss
robinson
is
coming
across
the
field
this
way
we
must
go
or
we
shall
be
caught
said
marjorie
it
too
bad
to
have
to
see
you
like
this
but
it
better
than
nothing
added
dona
you
can
send
me
those
sweets
you
talked
about
for
christmas
if
you
like
all
right
old
bunting
i
wo
back
out
of
my
promise
the
girls
dropped
from
the
palings
and
dived
into
the
plantation
just
before
miss
robinson
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
garden
passed
the
spot
if
she
had
looked
through
a
crack
in
the
boards
she
would
have
seen
larry
walking
away
but
happily
her
suspicions
were
not
aroused
marjorie
and
dona
strolled
leisurely
towards
the
hockey
field
the
latter
was
aggrieved
the
former
highly
indignant
it
absurd
groused
marjorie
if
one
ca
see
one
own
brother
especially
when
mother
had
written
to
say
we
might
we
had
to
see
him
somehow
and
i
think
it
a
great
deal
worse
to
be
obliged
to
go
like
this
and
talk
over
palings
than
to
meet
him
in
the
just
like
norty
nonsense
she
full
of
notions
and
a
because
the
empress
has
left
her
in
charge
i
feel
raggy
so
do
i
especially
to
miss
the
café
i
hope
larry
wo
forget
to
send
those
sweets
chapter
xii
the
school
union
the
last
few
days
of
the
term
were
passing
quickly
the
examinations
were
over
though
the
lists
were
not
yet
out
to
both
marjorie
and
dona
they
had
been
somewhat
of
an
ordeal
for
the
brackenfield
standard
was
high
when
confronted
with
sets
of
questions
the
girls
felt
previous
slackness
in
work
become
painfully
evident
it
was
horrible
to
have
to
sit
and
look
at
a
problem
without
the
least
idea
of
how
to
solve
it
or
to
find
that
the
dates
and
facts
which
ought
to
have
been
at
their
had
departed
to
distant
and
realms
of
their
memory
i
can
think
of
the
wretched
things
afterwards
mourned
dona
but
at
the
time
i
so
flustered
everything
i
want
to
remember
goes
utterly
out
of
my
head
i
really
knew
the
boundaries
of
germany
only
i
drew
them
wrong
on
the
map
and
in
the
literature
paper
i
mixed
up
pope
and
dryden
and
i
put
that
sheridan
wrote
stoops
to
instead
of
goldsmith
i
sure
i
failed
in
chemistry
groused
marjorie
and
the
latin
was
the
most
awful
paper
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
it
would
take
a
to
do
that
piece
of
unseen
translation
as
for
the
general
knowledge
paper
i
got
utterly
stumped
how
should
i
know
what
are
the
duties
of
a
high
sheriff
and
an
archdeacon
or
how
many
men
must
be
on
a
jury
even
mollie
simpson
said
it
was
stiff
and
she
good
at
all
that
kind
of
information
i
wonder
they
did
ask
us
how
many
currants
there
are
in
a
christmas
pudding
there
wo
be
many
this
year
laughed
dona
auntie
was
saying
currants
and
raisins
are
very
scarce
probably
we
sha
get
any
mince
pies
but
i
do
care
it
be
lovely
to
be
at
home
again
even
if
the
germans
sink
every
food
ship
and
only
leave
us
porridge
for
christmas
the
last
day
of
the
term
was
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
a
ceremony
at
brackenfield
lessons
proceeded
as
usual
until
twelve
when
the
whole
school
assembled
for
the
reading
of
the
examination
lists
marjorie
quaked
when
it
came
to
the
turn
of
iva
as
she
expected
she
had
failed
in
chemistry
though
she
had
just
scraped
through
in
latin
mathematics
and
general
knowledge
her
record
could
only
be
considered
fair
and
to
an
ambitious
girl
like
marjorie
it
was
humiliating
to
find
herself
lower
on
the
lists
than
others
who
were
younger
than
herself
i
brace
up
next
term
and
do
better
she
thought
as
morrison
congratulated
mollie
simpson
laura
norris
and
enid
young
on
their
excellent
work
and
deplored
the
low
standard
of
at
least
half
of
the
form
dona
greatly
to
her
surprise
had
done
less
badly
than
she
expected
and
instead
of
finding
herself
the
very
last
was
sixth
from
the
bottom
and
actually
above
mona
kenworthy
a
circumstance
which
made
her
literally
gasp
with
surprise
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
packing
each
girl
found
her
box
in
her
own
cubicle
and
started
to
the
joyful
task
of
turning
out
her
drawers
it
was
a
jolly
merry
proceeding
even
though
miss
norton
and
several
other
teachers
were
hovering
about
to
keep
order
and
ensure
that
the
girls
were
really
filling
their
trunks
instead
of
racing
in
and
out
of
the
dormitories
and
talking
as
would
certainly
have
been
the
case
if
they
had
been
left
to
their
own
devices
by
dint
of
good
generalship
on
the
part
of
the
house
mistress
and
her
staff
elgiva
completed
its
arrangements
twenty
minutes
before
the
other
hostels
and
had
therefore
the
credit
of
being
visited
first
by
the
janitor
and
the
gardener
whose
duty
it
was
to
carry
down
the
luggage
the
large
boxes
were
taken
away
that
evening
in
carts
to
the
station
and
duly
dispatched
each
girl
keeping
her
necessaries
for
the
night
which
she
would
take
home
with
her
in
a
no
prep
after
tea
thank
goodness
said
betty
moore
collecting
her
books
and
stowing
them
away
in
her
locker
i
do
want
to
see
this
wretched
old
history
again
for
a
month
i
sick
of
improving
my
mind
i
not
going
to
read
a
single
line
during
the
holidays
not
even
stories
i
go
out
riding
every
day
even
if
wet
mother
says
my
pony
quite
well
again
and
wants
exercising
get
it
bless
him
while
i
at
home
what
do
we
do
this
evening
instead
of
asked
marjorie
games
i
suppose
or
dancing
why
no
child
it
the
school
union
returned
betty
slamming
the
door
of
her
locker
what
that
great
minerva
do
you
know
you
painfully
new
even
yet
marjorie
anderson
there
do
get
raggy
i
tell
you
on
the
last
evening
of
every
term
the
whole
school
meets
in
the
big
hall
just
the
girls
without
any
of
the
teachers
the
prefects
sit
on
the
platform
and
the
head
girl
reads
a
kind
of
report
about
all
that
happened
during
the
term
the
games
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
what
she
and
the
prefects
have
noticed
and
what
the
societies
have
done
and
news
of
old
girls
and
all
the
rest
of
it
then
anybody
who
likes
can
make
comments
or
suggestions
for
next
term
or
air
grievances
it
a
kind
of
school
council
meeting
and
things
are
often
put
to
the
vote
it
gets
quite
exciting
we
do
have
supper
till
so
as
to
give
us
plenty
of
time
we
all
eat
an
extra
big
tea
so
as
to
carry
us
on
i
glad
you
warned
me
laughed
marjorie
do
they
bring
in
more
yes
loads
more
and
potted
meat
and
honey
and
jam
we
have
a
good
and
then
only
cocoa
and
buns
later
on
it
not
formal
supper
you
see
we
packed
our
white
dresses
and
ca
change
this
evening
we
only
our
serges
left
here
the
meeting
rather
a
stunt
we
have
a
jinky
time
as
a
rule
by
five
every
girl
in
the
school
had
assembled
in
the
big
hall
though
no
mistresses
were
present
the
proceedings
were
nevertheless
perfectly
orderly
and
good
discipline
prevailed
on
the
platform
sat
the
prefects
the
chair
being
taken
by
winifrede
mason
the
head
girl
winifrede
was
a
striking
personality
at
brackenfield
and
filled
her
post
with
dignity
she
was
eighteen
and
a
half
tall
and
finely
built
with
brown
eyes
and
smooth
dark
hair
she
had
a
firm
clever
face
and
a
quiet
authoritative
manner
that
carried
weight
in
the
school
and
crushed
any
symptoms
of
incipient
turbulence
amongst
juniors
many
of
the
girls
would
almost
rather
have
got
into
trouble
with
morrison
than
incur
the
displeasure
of
winifrede
and
a
word
of
praise
from
her
lips
was
esteemed
a
high
favour
she
did
not
believe
in
what
she
termed
making
herself
too
cheap
and
did
not
encourage
the
prefects
to
mix
at
all
freely
with
intermediates
or
juniors
so
that
to
most
of
the
girls
she
seemed
on
a
kind
of
pedestal
a
member
of
the
school
indeed
and
yet
raised
above
the
others
she
was
just
however
and
on
the
whole
a
great
favourite
for
though
she
kept
her
dignity
she
never
lost
touch
with
the
school
and
always
voiced
the
general
sentiments
she
stood
up
now
on
the
platform
and
began
what
might
be
termed
a
presidential
speech
girls
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
first
term
in
another
school
year
some
of
you
like
myself
are
old
brackenfielders
and
others
have
joined
us
lately
and
are
only
just
beginning
to
shake
down
into
our
ways
it
for
the
sake
of
these
that
i
want
just
briefly
to
recapitulate
some
of
the
standards
of
this
school
we
always
held
very
lofty
ideals
here
and
we
who
are
prefects
want
to
make
sure
that
during
our
time
they
are
kept
and
that
we
hand
them
on
unsullied
to
those
who
come
after
us
what
is
the
great
object
that
we
set
ourselves
to
aim
at
perhaps
some
of
you
will
say
do
well
at
our
lessons
or
win
at
games
well
that
all
a
part
of
it
the
main
thing
that
we
really
striving
for
is
the
formation
of
character
there
nothing
finer
in
all
the
world
and
character
can
only
be
formed
by
overcoming
difficulties
every
hard
lesson
you
master
or
every
game
you
win
helps
you
to
win
it
there
are
plenty
of
difficulties
at
school
nobody
finds
it
plain
sailing
when
you
cooped
up
with
so
many
other
girls
you
soon
find
you
ca
have
all
your
own
way
and
it
must
be
a
system
if
you
to
live
peaceably
with
your
fellows
when
this
great
war
broke
out
people
had
begun
to
say
that
our
young
men
of
britain
had
grown
soft
and
and
thought
of
nothing
except
pleasure
yet
at
the
nation
call
they
flung
up
all
they
had
and
flocked
to
enlist
and
proved
by
their
magnificent
courage
the
grit
that
was
in
them
after
all
our
women
too
society
women
who
had
been
perhaps
justly
branded
as
butterflies
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
have
shown
how
they
too
could
face
dangers
and
difficulties
and
privations
as
nurses
ambulance
drivers
canteen
workers
telephone
operators
some
have
played
their
part
in
the
field
of
war
and
their
sisters
at
home
have
worked
with
equal
courage
to
make
munitions
and
supply
the
places
left
vacant
by
the
men
now
i
do
suppose
there
is
a
girl
in
this
room
who
does
not
call
herself
patriotic
let
her
stop
for
a
moment
to
consider
what
she
means
it
is
only
waving
the
union
jack
and
singing
save
the
king
and
knitting
socks
for
soldiers
that
the
mere
outside
of
it
there
a
far
deeper
part
than
that
we
only
schoolgirls
now
but
in
a
few
years
we
shall
become
a
part
of
the
women
of
the
nation
in
the
future
britain
will
have
to
depend
largely
on
her
women
let
them
see
that
they
fit
themselves
for
the
burden
we
used
to
be
told
that
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
won
on
the
of
our
great
public
schools
well
i
believe
that
many
future
struggles
are
being
decided
by
the
life
in
our
girls
schools
of
though
we
may
realize
it
we
all
playing
our
part
in
history
and
though
our
names
may
never
go
down
to
posterity
our
influence
will
the
watchwords
of
all
patriotic
women
at
present
are
and
sacrifice
in
the
few
years
that
we
are
here
at
school
let
us
try
to
prepare
ourselves
to
be
an
asset
to
the
nation
afterwards
aim
for
the
highest
in
work
games
and
character
as
the
old
american
said
your
wagon
to
a
star
because
it
better
to
attempt
big
things
even
if
you
fail
than
to
be
satisfied
with
a
low
ideal
it
is
encouraging
for
us
brackenfielders
to
know
what
good
work
some
of
our
old
girls
are
doing
to
help
their
country
i

you
see
continued
winifrede
what
splendid
work
our
old
brackenfielders
are
doing
in
the
world
now
i
want
to
turn
to
some
of
our
own
activities
and
i
will
call
upon
our
games
captain
and
the
secretaries
of
the
various
societies
to
read
their
reports
stella
pearson
the
games
captain
at
once
rose
i
think
we
getting
on
fairly
well
at
hockey
she
announced
all
three
teams
are
satisfactory
the
match
with
silverton
was
played
in
glorious
weather
the
game
was
hard
and
very
fast
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
fouling
on
both
sides
we
scored
three
goals
during
the
first
half
and
though
our
forwards
pressed
hard
our
fourth
and
last
goal
was
not
gained
till
just
before
the
end
we
should
probably
have
scored
more
had
not
the
forwards
been
so
often
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
half
silverton
pressed
our
defence
hard
and
getting
away
with
the
ball
shot
two
goals
one
after
another
both
sides
played
hard
and
the
game
was
well
contested
it
was
only
spoilt
by
the
fouling
when
the
whistle
went
for
the
score
was
in
our
favour
and
we
found
that
the
unexpected
had
happened
and
that
we
had
actually
beaten
silverton
the
match
with
penley
club
as
you
know
we
lost
and
the
match
with
siddercombe
was
a
draw
so
we
may
consider
ourselves
to
be
just
about
even
this
term
next
term
we
must
brace
up
and
show
we
can
do
better
we
must
be
satisfied
till
brackenfield
has
beaten
her
record
reports
followed
next
from
the
various
societies
showing
what
work
had
been
done
in
the
general
reading
competition
the
photographic
society
the
natural
history
association
the
art
union
and
the
handicrafts
club
specimens
of
the
work
of
these
various
activities
had
been
laid
out
on
tables
and
as
soon
as
the
reports
had
been
read
the
girls
were
asked
to
walk
round
and
look
at
them
marjorie
in
company
with
mollie
simpson
made
a
tour
of
inspection
the
show
was
really
very
good
the
enlarging
apparatus
lately
acquired
by
the
photographic
society
had
proved
a
great
success
and
several
girls
exhibited
beautiful
views
of
the
school
moths
butterflies
fossils
shells
and
seaweeds
formed
an
interesting
group
for
the
natural
history
association
and
the
handicrafts
club
had
turned
out
a
wonderful
selection
of
toys
that
were
to
be
sent
to
the
soldiers
and
orphanage
the
golden
rule
society
had
quite
a
respectable
pile
of
socks
ready
to
be
forwarded
to
the
front
marjorie
said
very
little
as
she
went
the
round
of
the
tables
but
she
thought
much
she
had
not
realized
until
that
evening
all
that
brackenfield
stood
for
she
began
to
feel
that
it
was
worth
while
to
be
a
member
of
such
a
community
she
meant
to
try
really
hard
next
term
and
some
day
who
knew
perhaps
her
name
might
be
read
out
as
that
of
one
who
in
doing
useful
service
to
her
country
was
carrying
out
the
traditions
of
the
school
chapter
xiii
the
spring
term
both
marjorie
and
dona
described
their
holidays
as
absolutely
topping
to
begin
with
father
had
nearly
a
week
leave
he
could
not
arrive
for
christmas
but
he
was
with
them
for
new
year
day
and
by
the
greatest
good
luck
met
bevis
who
was
home
on
a
leave
to
have
two
of
their
dear
fighting
heroes
back
at
once
was
quite
an
unexpected
treat
and
though
there
were
still
two
vacant
places
in
the
circle
the
family
party
was
a
very
merry
one
they
were
joined
by
a
new
member
for
nora
and
her
husband
came
over
bringing
their
baby
boy
and
marjorie
dona
and
joan
felt
suddenly
quite
in
their
new
capacity
of
auntie
dona
in
especial
was
delighted
with
her
wee
nephew
i
found
out
what
i
going
to
do
when
i
leave
school
she
told
marjorie
rather
shyly
i
shall
go
to
help
at
a
crèche
when
winifrede
was
reading
out
that
of
old
girls
i
felt
utterly
miserable
because
i
knew
i
could
never
do
any
of
those
things
a
hospital
makes
me
sick
and
i
be
scared
to
death
to
drive
a
motor
ambulance
i
thought
winifrede
would
call
me
an
utter
slacker
but
i
could
look
after
babies
in
a
crèche
while
their
mothers
work
at
munitions
i
should
simply
love
it
and
it
would
be
doing
something
for
the
war
in
a
way
especially
if
they
were
soldiers
children
i
ever
so
much
happier
now
i
thought
of
it
i
going
to
ask
to
take
next
term
because
gertie
temple
told
me
they
learnt
how
to
mix
a
baby
bottle
and
i
going
to
ask
to
take
aid
replied
marjorie
with
equal
enthusiasm
you
have
to
pass
your
john
ambulance
before
you
can
be
a
i
just
love
practising
bandaging
the
girls
went
back
to
school
with
less
reluctance
than
their
mother
had
expected
it
was
of
course
a
wrench
to
leave
home
and
for
dona
at
any
rate
the
atmosphere
was
at
first
a
little
damp
but
once
installed
in
their
old
quarters
at
brackenfield
they
were
caught
in
the
train
of
bustling
young
life
and
cheered
up
it
is
not
easy
to
sit
on
your
bed
and
weep
when
your
are
telling
you
their
holiday
adventures
singing
comic
songs
and
passing
round
jokes
also
tears
were
unfashionable
at
brackenfield
and
any
girl
found
shedding
them
was
liable
to
be
branded
as
early
victorian
or
worse
still
as
a
sentimental
silly
marjorie
happened
to
be
the
first
arrival
in
dormitory
no
she
drew
the
curtains
of
her
cubicle
and
began
to
unpack
feeling
rather
glad
to
have
the
place
to
herself
for
a
while
when
the
next
convoy
of
girls
arrived
from
the
station
miss
norton
entered
the
room
escorting
a
stranger
this
is
your
cubicle
she
explained
hurriedly
your
box
will
be
brought
up
presently
and
then
you
can
unpack
and
put
your
clothes
in
this
wardrobe
and
these
drawers
the
are
at
the
end
of
the
passage
come
downstairs
when
you
hear
the
gong
the
house
mistress
whose
duties
on
the
first
day
of
term
were
onerous
departed
like
a
whirlwind
leaving
the
stranger
standing
by
her
bed
marjorie
drew
aside
her
curtains
and
introduced
herself
hallo
i
suppose
you
a
new
girl
you
got
irene
cubicle
i
wonder
where
she
to
go
i
marjorie

but
i
hope

the
cubicle
the
bed
does
look
big
enough
for
two
unless
as
thin
as
a
lath
there
a
good
deal
of
me
marjorie
laughed
for
the
sounded
humorous
she
was
a
tall
girl
with
a
fair
complexion
flaxen
hair
and
blue
eyes
the
pupils
of
which
were
unusually
large
though
not
absolutely
pretty
she
was
decidedly
she
put
her
on
the
bed
and
began
to
take
out
a
few
possessions
opened
her
drawers
and
inspected
the
capacities
of
her
wardrobe
not
too
much
room
here
she
commented
it
reminds
me
of
a
cabin
on
board
ship
i
wonder
they
do
rig
up
berths
i
hope
they
wo
be

my
box

it
is
not
only
did
the
trunk
arrive
but
betty
and

and
talkative

and
miss

war
wedding
oh
yes
she
has
come
back
to

but
we
got
to
call
her
greenbank
now
wo
it
be
funny
the
empress
has
two
little
nieces
staying
with
her
they
five
and
seven
such
sweet
little
kiddies
with
curly
hair
their
father
at
the
front
the
new
girl
listened
with
apparent
interest
as
betty
and
sylvia
rattled
on
but
she
did
not
interrupt
and
waited
until
she
was
questioned
before
she
gave
an
account
of
herself
i
live
up
north
in
cumberland
yes
i
been
to
school
before
one
brother
no
he
not
at
the
front
i
have
unpacked
his
photo
i
ca
tell
whether
i
like
brackenfield
yet
i
only
been
here
half
an
hour
as
she
still
seemed
at
the
shy
stage
betty
and
sylvia
stopped
catechizing
her
and
concerned
themselves
with
their
own
affairs
the
went
on
quietly
with
her
unpacking
taking
no
notice
of
her
but
when
the
gong
sounded
for
tea
she
allowed
betty
and
sylvia
to
pass
then
looked
at
marjorie
may
i
go
down
with
you
she
asked
i
do
know
my
way
about
yet
sorry
to
be
a
nuisance
you
can
drop
me
if
you
like
when
you
landed
me
in
the
i
do
want
to
tag
on
at
the
end
of
a
week
opinions
in
dormitory
no
were
divided
on
the
subject
of
chrissie
lang
betty
and
sylvia
frankly
regretted
irene
and
were
not
disposed
to
extend
too
hearty
a
welcome
to
her
substitute
it
was
really
in
the
first
instance
because
betty
and
sylvia
were
disagreeable
to
chrissie
that
marjorie
took
her
up
it
was
more
in
a
spirit
of
opposition
to
her
than
of
philanthropy
towards
the
betty
and
sylvia
were
inclined
to
have
fun
together
and
leave
marjorie
out
of
their
calculations
a
state
of
affairs
which
she
hotly
resented
during
the
whole
of
last
term
she
had
not
found
a
chum
she
was
rather
friendly
with
mollie
simpson
but
mollie
was
in
another
dormitory
and
this
term
had
been
moved
into
iv
upper
a
so
that
they
were
no
longer
working
together
in
form
it
was
perhaps
only
natural
that
she
adopted
chrissie
she
certainly
found
her
an
amusing
companion
if
nothing
more
chrissie
was
humorous
and
always
inclined
for
fun
she
kept
up
a
constant
fire
of
little
jokes
she
would
draw
absurd
pictures
of
girls
or
mistresses
on
the
edge
of
her
or
write
parodies
on
popular
poems
she
was
evidently
much
attracted
to
marjorie
yet
she
was
one
of
those
people
with
whom
one
never
grows
really
intimate
one
may
know
them
for
years
without
ever
getting
beyond
the
outside
crust
and
the
heart
of
them
always
remains
a
sealed
book
there
is
a
certain
magnetism
in
friendship
it
is
perhaps
only
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
that
we
meet
the
one
with
whom
our
spirit
can
really
fuse
the
kindred
soul
who
seems
always
able
to
understand
and
sympathize
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
school
life
however
it
is
something
to
have
a
congenial
comrade
if
it
is
only
a
girl
who
will
sit
next
you
at
meals
walk
to
church
with
you
in
crocodile
and
take
your
side
in
arguments
with
your
the
spring
term
at
brackenfield
proved
bitterly
cold
in
february
the
snow
fell
thickly
and
one
morning
the
school
woke
to
find
a
white
world
in
dormitory
matters
were
serious
for
the
snow
had
drifted
in
through
the
open
window
and
covered
everything
like
a
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
girls
to
see
and
shrouded
in
white
and
a
drift
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
they
set
to
work
after
breakfast
with
shovels
and
toiled
away
till
nearly
before
they
had
made
a
clearance
i
feel
like
an
alpine
traveller
declared
chrissie
if
things
go
on
at
this
rate
the
school
will
have
to
provide
bernard
dogs
to
rescue
us
in
the
mornings
the
newspapers
say
it
the
worst
frost
since
remarked
sylvia
i
think
it
the
limit
groused
betty
give
me
good
open
hunting
weather
i
hate
snow
hockey
be
off
said
marjorie
it
a
grizzly
nuisance
about
the
match
on
saturday
though
the
usual
outdoor
games
were
perforce
suspended
the
school
nevertheless
found
an
outlet
for
its
energies
there
was
a
little
hill
at
the
bottom
of
the
big
and
down
this
the
girls
managed
to
get
some
tobogganing
they
had
no
sleds
but
requisitioned
and
often
with
rather
amusing
results
though
fortunately
the
snow
was
soft
to
fall
in
another
diversion
was
a
mock
battle
the
combatants
threw
up
trenches
of
snow
and
arming
themselves
with
a
supply
of
snowballs
kept
up
a
brisk
fire
until
ammunition
was
exhausted
it
was
a
splendid
way
of
keeping
up
the
circulation
and
the
girls
would
run
in
after
this
exercise
with
crimson
cheeks
at
night
however
they
suffered
very
much
from
the
cold
open
bedroom
windows
were
a
cardinal
rule
and
with
the
thermometer
many
degrees
below
zero
the
less
hardy
found
it
almost
impossible
to
keep
warm
marjorie
who
was
rather
a
chilly
subject
lay
awake
night
after
night
and
shivered
it
was
true
that
hot
bricks
were
allowed
but
with
so
many
beds
to
look
after
the
maids
did
not
always
bring
them
up
at
standard
heat
and
marjorie
toes
often
found
only
lukewarm
comfort
after
enduring
the
misery
for
three
nights
she
boldly
went
to
morrison
and
begged
permission
to
be
taken
to
whitecliffe
to
buy
an
bag
which
she
could
herself
fill
in
the
part
of
the
empress
success
as
a
principal
was
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
any
reasonable
demands
hers
was
no
rule
but
a
system
based
on
sensible
methods
she
smiled
as
marjorie
rather
bashfully
uttered
her
request
fifteen
other
girls
have
asked
me
the
same
thing
she
replied
you
may
all
go
into
whitecliffe
this
afternoon
with
miss
duckworth
and
see
what
you
can
find
at
the
stores
rejoicing
in
this
little
expedition
the
favoured
sixteen
set
off
at
two
escorted
by
the
mistress
there
had
been
great
drifts
on
the
high
road
and
the
snow
was
dug
out
and
piled
on
either
side
in
glistening
heaps
the
white
cliffs
and
hills
and
the
grey
sky
and
sea
gave
an
unusual
aspect
to
the
landscape
a
flock
of
whirled
round
on
the
beach
but
of
other
birds
there
were
very
few
even
the
clumps
of
seaweed
on
the
shore
looked
frozen
nature
was
at
her
dreariest
and
anyone
who
had
seen
the
place
in
the
summer
glory
of
heather
bracken
and
blue
sea
could
hardly
have
believed
it
to
be
the
same
the
promenade
was
deserted
the
pier
shut
up
and
those
people
whose
business
took
them
into
the
streets
hurried
along
as
if
they
were
anxious
to
get
home
again
the
girls
found
it
was
not
such
an
easy
matter
as
they
had
imagined
to
procure
sixteen
bags
owing
to
the
war
rubber
was
scarce
and
customers
had
already
made
many
demands
upon
the
supply
the
stores
could
only
produce
nine
bags
i
have
some
on
order
and
expect
them
in
any
day
said
the
assistant
shall
i
send
some
out
for
you
when
they
come
knowing
by
experience
that
goods
thus
ordered
might
take
weeks
to
arrive
the
girls
declined
and
set
out
to
visit
the
various
shops
in
the
town
with
the
result
that
by
buying
a
few
at
each
they
in
the
end
made
up
their
numbers
the
sizes
and
prices
of
the
bags
varied
considerably
but
the
girls
were
so
glad
to
get
any
at
all
that
they
would
have
cheerfully
paid
double
if
it
had
been
necessary
feeling
thoroughly
satisfied
with
their
shopping
expedition
they
turned
their
steps
again
towards
brackenfield
up
the
steep
path
past
the
church
over
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
railway
and
along
the
cliff
walk
that
led
from
the
town
on
to
the
moor
as
they
passed
the
end
of
the
bare
beech
avenue
they
met
a
party
of
wounded
soldiers
from
the
red
cross
hospital
in
the
blue
convalescent
uniform
of
his
forces
one
limped
on
crutches
and
one
was
in
a
bath
chair
wheeled
by
a
companion
most
of
the
rest
wore
bandages
either
on
their
arms
or
heads
marjorie
looked
at
them
attentively
hoping
to
recognize
some
of
the
patients
she
had
seen
at
the
entertainment
but
these
were
all
strangers
and
she
reflected
that
the
other
set
must
have
been
passed
on
by
now
to
convalescent
homes
she
was
walking
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
miss
duckworth
did
not
happen
to
be
looking
a
sudden
spirit
of
mischief
seized
her
and
hastily
stooping
and
catching
up
a
handful
of
snow
she
kneaded
it
quickly
and
threw
it
at
mollie
simpson
to
attract
her
attention
it
was
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
in
sheer
fun
but
alas
for
marjorie
her
aim
was
not
true
and
instead
of
hitting
mollie
her
missile
struck
one
of
the
soldiers
he
chuckled
with
delight
and
promptly
responded
in
a
moment
his
companions
were
kneading
snowballs
and
pelting
the
school
now
wounded
tommies
are
regarded
as
very
privileged
persons
and
the
girls
instantly
catching
the
spirit
of
the
encounter
broke
line
and
began
to
throw
back
snowballs
girls
girls
cried
miss
duckworth
shocked
and
agitated
voice
come
along
at
once
do
look
at
those
soldiers
attention
form
line
immediately
quick
march
rather
flushed
and
flurried
her
flock
controlled
themselves
conscious
that
they
had
overstepped
the
mark
and
under
the
keen
eye
of
their
mistress
who
now
brought
up
the
rear
instead
of
leading
they
filed
off
in
their
former
crocodile
every
one
of
the
sixteen
knew
that
there
was
trouble
in
store
for
her
they
discussed
it
uneasily
on
the
way
home
nor
were
they
mistaken
at
miss
rogers
after
ringing
the
silence
bell
announced
that
those
girls
who
had
been
to
whitecliffe
that
afternoon
must
report
themselves
in
morrison
study
at
it
is
one
thing
to
indulge
in
a
moment
fun
and
quite
another
to
pay
the
price
afterwards
sixteen
very
rueful
faces
were
assembled
in
the
passage
outside
the
study
by
nobody
would
have
had
the
courage
to
knock
but
the
principal
herself
opened
the
door
and
bade
them
enter
they
filed
in
like
a
row
of
prisoners
morrison
marshalled
them
into
a
double
line
opposite
her
desk
then
standing
so
as
to
command
the
eyes
of
all
she
opened
the
vials
of
her
wrath
she
reproached
them
for
unladylike
conduct
loss
of
dignity
and
lack
of
discipline
where
are
the
traditions
of
brackenfield
she
asked
if
you
can
so
far
forget
yourselves
as
to
descend
to
such
behaviour
one
would
imagine
you
were
poor
ignorant
girls
who
had
never
been
taught
better
indeed
many
a
class
would
have
had
more
whoever
began
it
here
she
looked
hard
at
marjorie
is
directly
responsible
for
lowering
the
tone
of
the
school
think
what
disgrace
it
brings
on
the
name
of
brackenfield
for
such
an
act
to
be
remembered
against
her
pupils
knit
and
sew
for
the
soldiers
get
up
concerts
for
them
and
speak
kindly
to
them
in
the
hospitals
but
never
for
a
moment
forget
in
your
conduct
what
is
due
both
to
yourself
and
to
them
this
occurrence
has
grieved
me
more
than
i
can
express
i
had
believed
that
i
could
trust
you
but
i
find
to
my
sorrow
that
i
was
mistaken
chapter
xiv
the
secret
society
of
patriots
marjorie
friendship
for
chrissie
lang
at
present
flamed
at
red
heat
marjorie
was
prone
to
violent
attachments
her
temperament
was
excitable
and
she
was
easily
swayed
by
her
emotions
she
would
take
up
new
people
with
enthusiasm
though
she
was
apt
to
drop
them
afterwards
since
her
babyhood
marjorie
latest
idol
had
been
a
byword
in
the
family
she
had
worshipped
by
turns
her
kindergarten
teacher
a
little
boy
whom
she
met
at
her
gymnasium
mistress
at
least
ten
separate
the
girl
guides
captain
and
a
friend
of
nora
her
affection
varied
according
to
the
responsiveness
of
the
object
though
in
some
cases
she
had
even
been
ready
to
love
without
return
chrissie
however
seemed
ready
to
meet
her
she
was
enthusiastic
and
demonstrative
and
rather
sentimental
to
be
sure
she
gave
marjorie
very
little
of
her
confidence
but
the
latter
who
liked
to
talk
herself
and
pour
out
her
own
ideas
did
not
trouble
on
that
score
and
was
quite
content
to
have
found
a
sympathetic
listener
the
two
girls
were
inseparable
they
walked
round
the
quadrangle
arm
in
arm
they
sat
side
by
side
in
any
class
where
liberty
to
choose
places
was
allowed
they
exchanged
picture
post
cards
foreign
stamps
and
crests
they
gave
each
other
presents
and
wrote
sentimental
little
notes
which
they
hid
under
one
another
pillows
the
general
opinion
of
the
form
was
that
marjorie
had
got
it
badly
ca
imagine
what
she
sees
in
chrissie
lang
myself
sniffed
annie
turner
she
not
particularly
interesting
her
nose
is
too
big
and
she
ca
say
her
r
properly
she
mean
too
added
francie
sheppard
i
collecting
for
the
seamen
mission
and
she
would
even
give
me
a
penny
she
tried
to
truckle
to
norty
too
put
in
patricia
lennox
she
bought
violets
in
whitecliffe
and
laid
them
on
the
desk
in
study
with
a
piece
of
cardboard
tied
to
them
with
white
ribbon
and
love
from
your
devoted
pupil
chrissie
written
on
it
norty
gave
them
back
to
her
though
and
said
she
made
it
a
rule
to
accept
nothing
from
any
girl
not
even
flowers
good
for
norty
oh
trust
the
acid
drop
not
to
lapse
into
anything
sentimental
as
hard
as
nails
the
dodge
does
go
down
with
her
marjorie
had
to
run
a
considerable
gauntlet
of
chaff
from
her
schoolmates
but
that
did
not
trouble
her
in
the
least
a
little
opposition
indeed
added
spice
to
the
friendship
her
home
letters
were
full
of
praise
of
her
new
idol
chrissie
is
the
most
adorable
girl
you
can
imagine
she
wrote
to
her
mother
we
do
everything
together
now
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
she
has
come
to
school
i
tell
her
all
about
bevis
and
leonard
and
larry
and
she
is
so
interested
and
wants
to
know
just
where
they
are
and
what
they
are
doing
she
says
it
is
because
they
are
my
brothers
dona
does
not
care
for
her
very
much
but
that
is
because
she
is
such
great
friends
with
ailsa
donald
i
took
a
snapshot
of
chris
yesterday
and
she
took
one
of
me
i
send
them
both
to
you
as
soon
as
we
have
developed
and
printed
them
we
do
get
much
time
to
do
photography
because
we
keen
on
acting
this
term
and
i
in
the
charade
society
chrissie
has
made
me
a
handkerchief
in
stitch
and
embroidered
my
name
most
beautifully
on
it
i
wish
i
could
sew
as
well
as
she
does
i
lost
it
in
the
hockey
field
and
did
not
find
it
for
three
days
and
i
dared
not
tell
chrissie
all
that
time
for
fear
she
might
be
offended
she
dreadfully
sensitive
she
says
she
has
a
highly
nervous
organism
and
i
think
it
true
it
was
about
this
time
that
it
was
rumoured
in
elgiva
that
irene
andrews
had
started
a
secret
society
what
its
name
or
object
might
be
nobody
knew
but
its
votaries
posed
considerably
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
of
the
hostel
they
preserved
an
air
of
aloofness
and
dignity
as
if
concerned
with
weighty
matters
it
was
evident
that
they
had
a
password
and
a
code
of
signals
and
that
they
met
in
irene
dormitory
with
closed
door
and
a
scout
to
keep
off
intruders
when
pressed
to
give
at
least
a
hint
as
to
the
nature
of
their
proceedings
they
replied
that
they
would
cheerfully
face
torture
or
the
stake
before
consenting
to
reveal
a
single
word
now
dormitory
no
had
never
quite
forgiven
irene
for
deserting
in
favour
of
no
and
mavie
chapman
its
occupants
discussed
the
matter
as
they
went
to
bed
renie
so
fearfully
important
complained
betty
i
asked
her
something
this
morning
and
she
said
interrupt
me
child
as
if
she
were
the
king
busy
on
state
affairs
she
hardly
look
at
us
nowadays
agreed
sylvia
plaintively
i
tell
you
what
suggested
marjorie
let
get
up
a
secret
society
of
our
own
it
would
take
the
wind
out
of
renie
sails
tremendously
to
find
that
we
had
passwords
and
signals
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
be
most
fearfully
annoyed
it
a
good
idea
assented
sylvia
but
what
could
we
have
a
secret
society
about
well
why
not
have
it
a
sort
of
patriotic
one
to
do
all
we
can
to
help
the
war
knit
socks
for
the
soldiers
and
that
kind
of
thing
we
knit
socks
already
objected
betty
that
does
matter
we
must
knit
more
that
all
there
must
be
heaps
of
things
we
can
do
for
the
war
besides
it
the
spirit
of
the
thing
that
counts
we
pledge
ourselves
to
give
our
last
drop
of
blood
for
our
country
we
all
of
us
got
fathers
and
brothers
who
are
fighting
chrissie
has
anybody
at
the
front
demurred
betty
rather
spitefully
that
not
chrissie
fault
we
not
all
born
with
brothers
because
you
lucky
enough
to
have
an
uncle
who
an
admiral
you
need
quite
squash
other
people
how
you
fly
out
i
was
only
mentioning
a
fact
anybody
with
tact
would
have
mentioned
it
what
shall
we
call
the
society
asked
sylvia
bringing
the
disputants
back
to
the
original
subject
of
the
discussion
how
would
secret
society
of
patriots
do
suggested
chrissie
the
very
thing
assented
marjorie
warmly
trust
chrissie
to
hit
on
the
right
name
we
let
just
a
few
into
it
patricia
perhaps
and
enid
and
mollie
but
nobody
else
we
must
take
an
oath
and
regard
it
as
absolutely
binding
like
the
freemasons
agreed
sylvia
i
believe
they
kill
anybody
who
betrays
them
we
have
an
initiation
ceremony
purred
marjorie
highly
delighted
with
the
new
venture
and
of
course
we
arrange
a
password
and
signals
and
i
do
see
why
we
should
have
a
cryptogram
and
write
each
other
notes
it
would
be
ever
so
baffling
for
the
rest
to
find
letters
lying
about
that
they
could
read
they
be
most
indignant
right
you
are
it
be
priceless
we
do
irene
this
time
the
new
society
at
once
established
itself
upon
lines
of
utmost
secrecy
its
initiates
found
large
satisfaction
in
playing
it
off
against
their
rivals
though
they
preserved
its
objects
in
a
halo
of
mystery
they
allowed
just
the
initials
of
its
name
to
leak
out
so
as
to
convince
the
hostel
of
its
reality
unfortunately
they
had
not
noticed
that
spells
sop
but
the
outside
public
eagerly
seized
at
such
an
opportunity
and
nicknamed
them
the
milksops
on
the
spot
as
they
had
expected
irene
and
her
satellites
were
highly
affronted
at
an
opposition
society
being
started
and
flung
scorn
at
its
members
we
must
mind
them
urged
marjorie
patiently
it
really
a
compliment
to
us
that
they
so
annoyed
we
just
go
on
our
own
way
and
take
no
notice
i
invented
a
beautiful
cryptogram
they
never
guess
it
without
the
key
if
they
try
for
a
year
the
code
of
signals
was
easily
mastered
by
the
society
but
they
jibbed
at
the
cryptogram
it
too
difficult
and
i
really
have
the
brains
to
learn
it
said
betty
decidedly
it
as
bad
as
lessons
wailed
sylvia
even
chrissie
objected
to
being
obliged
to
translate
notes
written
in
cipher
it
takes
such
a
long
time
she
demurred
i
thought
have
done
it
said
marjorie
reproachfully
afraid
you
do
care
for
me
as
much
as
you
did
the
main
difficulty
of
the
society
was
to
find
sufficient
outlets
for
its
activities
at
present
knitting
socks
seemed
the
only
form
of
aid
which
it
was
possible
to
render
the
soldiers
the
members
decided
that
they
must
work
harder
at
this
occupation
and
produce
more
pairs
some
of
them
smuggled
their
knitting
into
preparation
with
the
result
that
their
form
work
suffered
they
bore
loss
of
marks
and
miss
reproaches
with
the
heroism
of
martyrs
to
a
cause
we
could
tell
her
we
were
fulfilling
vows
sighed
marjorie
though
i
was
rather
tempted
to
ask
her
which
was
more
important
my
euclid
or
the
feet
of
some
soldier
at
the
front
she
would
have
understood
well
no
i
suppose
not
unless
we
explained
could
we
ask
norty
to
let
us
save
our
jam
and
send
it
to
the
soldiers
marjorie
shook
her
head
we
could
get
it
out
to
the
front
and
they
heaps
of
it
at
the
red
cross
hospital
at
least
elaine
says
so
and
she
helps
in
the
pantry
at
present
we
might
sell
our
hair
for
the
benefit
of
the
belgians
remarked
betty
gazing
thoughtfully
at
marjorie
long
plait
and
sylvia
silken
curls
oh
i
dare
say
when
your
own
short
responded
sylvia
indignantly
i
might
as
well
suggest
selling
our
ponies
because
you
got
one
and
i
have
if
i
wrote
a
patriotic
poem
i
wonder
how
much
it
would
cost
to
get
it
printed
asked
enid
i
make
all
the
girls
in
our
form
buy
copies
we
might
get
up
a
concert
but
would
that
give
away
our
secret
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
society
still
hot
upon
her
marjorie
started
for
her
fortnightly
exeat
at
her
aunt
she
felt
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
tamarisks
would
be
stimulating
everybody
connected
with
that
establishment
was
doing
something
for
the
war
uncle
andrew
was
on
a
military
tribunal
aunt
ellinor
presided
over
numerous
committees
to
send
parcels
to
prisoners
or
to
aid
soldiers
orphans
elaine
life
centred
round
the
red
cross
hospital
and
norman
and
wilfred
were
at
the
front
she
found
her
aunt
with
the
table
spread
over
with
papers
busily
scribbling
letters
i
on
a
new
committee
she
explained
after
greeting
her
niece
i
have
to
find
people
who
undertake
to
write
to
lonely
soldiers
some
of
our
poor
fellows
never
have
a
letter
and
the
chaplains
say
it
most
pathetic
to
see
how
wistful
they
look
when
the
mails
come
in
and
nothing
for
them
i
think
it
just
too
touching
for
words
suppose
norman
and
wilfred
were
never
remembered
did
you
say
elaine
that
wilkins
has
promised
to
take
private
dudley
that
right
and
hopwood
will
take
private
roberts
it
very
kind
of
her
when
she
so
busy
already
we
have
anybody
yet
for
private
hargreaves
i
must
find
him
a
correspondent
somehow
what
is
it
dona
dear
you
want
me
to
look
at
your
photos
most
certainly
aunt
ellinor
kind
busy
and
impulsive
and
always
anxious
to
entertain
the
girls
when
they
came
for
their
fortnightly
visit
pushed
aside
her
papers
and
immediately
gave
her
whole
attention
to
the
snapshots
which
dona
showed
her
i
took
them
with
the
camera
you
gave
me
at
christmas
explained
her
niece
miss
jones
says
it
must
be
a
very
good
lens
because
come
out
so
well
is
this
one
of
marjorie
topping
it
nice
only
it
makes
her
look
too
old
commented
elaine
you
ca
see
her
plait
and
she
might
be
quite
have
you
a
book
to
paste
your
photos
in
not
yet
i
must
put
that
down
in
my
birthday
list
i
believe
i
have
one
upstairs
that
i
can
give
you
it
somewhere
in
my
cupboard
i
go
and
look
for
it
oh
let
me
come
with
you
chirruped
dona
running
after
her
cousin
marjorie
stayed
in
the
because
aunt
ellinor
had
just
handed
her
norman
last
letter
and
she
wanted
to
read
it
she
was
only
through
the
first
page
when
a
maid
announced
a
visitor
and
her
aunt
rose
and
went
to
the
norman
news
from
the
front
was
very
interesting
she
devoured
it
eagerly
as
a
he
added
write
as
often
as
you
can
you
do
know
what
letters
mean
to
us
out
here
marjorie
folded
the
thin
foreign
sheets
and
put
them
back
in
their
envelope
if
norman
who
was
kept
well
supplied
with
home
news
longed
for
letters
what
must
be
the
case
of
those
lonely
soldiers
who
had
not
a
friend
to
use
pen
and
paper
on
their
behalf
surely
it
would
be
a
kind
and
patriotic
act
to
write
to
one
of
them
marjorie
impulsive
temperament
snatched
eagerly
at
the
idea
the
very
sort
of
thing
i
been
yearning
to
do
she
decided
why
that
what
our
membership
is
for
auntie
said
she
had
found
a
correspondent
for
private
hargreaves
i
send
him
a
letter
myself
it
dreadful
to
think
of
him
out
in
the
trenches
without
a
soul
to
take
an
interest
in
him
poor
fellow
without
waiting
to
consult
anybody
marjorie
borrowed
her
aunt
pen
took
a
sheet
of
foreign
paper
from
the
rack
that
stood
on
the
table
and
quite
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
scribbled
off
the
following
epistle
brackenfield
college
whitecliffe
dear
private
hargreaves
i
am
so
sorry
to
think
of
you
being
lonely
in
the
trenches
and
having
no
letters
and
i
want
to
write
and
say
we
english
girls
think
of
all
the
brave
men
who
are
fighting
to
defend
our
country
and
we
thank
them
from
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
i
know
how
terrible
it
is
for
you
because
i
have
a
brother
in
france
and
one
on
a
battleship
and
one
in
and
five
cousins
at
the
front
and
my
father
at
havre
so
i
hear
all
about
the
hard
life
you
have
to
lead
i
have
been
to
the
red
cross
hospital
and
seen
the
wounded
soldiers
i
knit
socks
to
send
to
the
troops
and
we
want
to
get
up
a
concert
to
raise
some
money
for
the
huts
i
hope
you
will
not
feel
so
lonely
now
you
know
that
somebody
is
thinking
about
you
believe
me
your
sincere
friend
marjorie
anderson
it
exactly
filled
up
a
sheet
and
marjorie
folded
it
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
copied
the
address
from
the
list
which
her
aunt
had
left
lying
on
the
table
seeing
dona
photos
also
spread
out
she
took
the
little
snapshot
of
herself
and
enclosed
it
in
the
letter
she
had
a
stamp
of
her
own
in
her
purse
which
she
affixed
then
slipped
the
envelope
in
her
pocket
she
did
not
mention
the
matter
to
aunt
ellinor
or
elaine
because
to
do
so
would
almost
seem
like
betraying
the
whose
patriotic
principles
were
vowed
to
strictest
secrecy
she
considered
it
was
a
case
of
doing
good
by
stealth
and
plumed
herself
on
how
she
would
score
over
the
other
girls
when
she
reported
such
a
very
practical
application
of
the
aims
of
the
society
her
cousin
returned
with
dona
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
and
suggested
taking
the
girls
into
whitecliffe
where
she
wished
to
do
some
shopping
they
all
three
started
off
at
once
as
they
passed
the
in
the
high
street
marjorie
managed
to
drop
in
her
letter
unobserved
it
was
an
exhilarating
feeling
to
know
that
it
was
really
gone
they
went
to
a
café
for
tea
and
as
they
sat
looking
at
the
allies
flags
which
draped
the
walls
and
listening
to
the
military
marches
played
by
a
ladies
orchestra
in
khaki
uniforms
patriotism
seemed
uppermost
it
grand
to
do
anything
for
one
country
sighed
marjorie
so
it
is
answered
elaine
pulling
her
knitting
from
her
pocket
and
rapidly
going
on
with
a
sock
those
poor
fellows
in
the
trenches
deserve
everything
we
can
send
out
to
them
socks
toffee
cakes
cigarettes
scented
soap
and
other
comforts
and
letters
added
marjorie
under
her
breath
to
herself
chapter
xv
the
empress
the
was
duly
thrilled
when
marjorie
reported
her
act
of
patriotism
its
members
however
reproached
her
that
she
had
not
copied
down
the
names
and
addresses
of
other
lonely
soldiers
on
her
aunt
list
so
that
they
also
might
have
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
their
bit
there
was
time
marjorie
apologized
elaine
came
back
into
the
room
almost
immediately
and
i
dare
let
her
and
dona
know
because
it
would
have
broken
my
vow
her
friends
admitted
the
excuse
but
it
was
plain
that
they
were
disappointed
and
considered
that
with
a
little
more
promptitude
she
might
have
succeeded
did
you
tell
him
about
our
society
asked
betty
no
of
course
not
well
i
did
mean
betraying
the
secret
exactly
only
i
think
you
might
have
mentioned
that
there
are
several
of
us
who
want
to
do
things
for
the
soldiers
and
there
was
a
beautiful
snapshot
that
patricia
took
of
us
all
you
might
have
put
that
in
but
i
had
got
it
with
me
you
need
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
send
off
the
letter
you
could
have
waited
till
you
seen
us
how
could
i
post
it
from
school
it
was
by
sheer
luck
i
slipped
it
into
the
at
whitecliffe
i
got
my
chance
to
write
that
letter
and
i
had
to
take
it
at
once
or
leave
it
perhaps
our
turns
may
come
another
time
suggested
patricia
consolingly
though
it
was
marjorie
who
had
done
the
actual
writing
the
whole
of
the
felt
responsible
for
the
letter
and
considered
that
they
had
adopted
the
lonely
soldier
in
imagination
they
pictured
private
hargreaves
sitting
disconsolately
in
a
gazing
with
wistful
eyes
while
his
comrades
read
and
their
home
letters
then
an
orderly
entering
and
presenting
him
with
marjorie
document
his
incredulity
surprise
and
delight
at
finding
it
actually
addressed
to
himself
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
would
tear
open
the
envelope
opinions
differed
as
to
what
would
happen
when
he
had
read
it
sylvia
inclined
to
think
that
tears
would
steal
down
his
rugged
cheek
betty
was
certain
that
however
bad
he
might
have
been
formerly
he
would
at
once
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
begin
to
reform
patricia
suggested
that
he
would
write
on
the
envelope
that
he
wished
it
to
be
buried
with
him
schemes
for
sending
him
pressed
violets
poems
and
photographs
floated
on
the
horizon
of
the
society
he
should
not
feel
lonely
any
more
if
the
could
help
it
they
decided
that
each
would
contribute
twopence
a
week
towards
buying
him
cigarettes
they
went
about
the
school
quite
jauntily
in
the
consciousness
of
their
secret
the
rival
secret
society
noticing
their
elation
openly
jeered
but
that
no
doubt
was
envy
a
fortnight
passed
by
and
the
girls
were
beginning
to
forget
about
it
a
little
the
snow
had
melted
and
hockey
practice
was
uppermost
in
their
minds
for
the
match
between
githa
and
elgiva
would
soon
be
due
and
they
were
anxious
for
the
credit
of
their
own
hostel
just
at
present
the
loomed
larger
than
the
trenches
team
was
not
yet
decided
and
each
hoped
in
her
innermost
heart
that
she
might
be
chosen
among
the
favoured
eleven
marjorie
had
lately
improved
very
much
at
hockey
and
had
won
words
of
approval
from
stella
pearson
the
games
captain
together
with
helpful
criticism
it
was
well
known
that
stella
did
not
waste
trouble
on
unpromising
subjects
so
it
was
highly
encouraging
to
marjorie
to
find
her
play
noticed
golden
visions
of
winning
goals
for
her
hostel
swam
before
her
dazzled
eyes
she
dreamt
one
night
that
she
was
captain
of
the
team
she
almost
quarrelled
with
chrissie
because
the
latter
who
was
a
slack
player
did
not
share
her
enthusiasm
one
monday
morning
marjorie
woke
up
with
a
curious
sense
of
impending
trouble
she
occasionally
had
a
fit
of
the
blues
on
mondays
sunday
was
a
quiet
day
at
brackenfield
and
in
the
evening
the
girls
wrote
their
home
letters
the
effect
was
often
an
intense
longing
for
the
holidays
on
this
particular
monday
she
tried
to
shake
off
the
wretched
dismal
feeling
but
did
not
succeed
it
lasted
throughout
breakfast
in
spite
of
chrissie
humorous
rallyings
you
as
glum
as
an
owl
remarked
her
chum
at
last
i
ca
help
it
i
feel
as
if
something
horrible
is
going
to
happen
marjorie
premonition
turned
out
to
be
justified
for
as
she
was
leaving
the
after
breakfast
miss
norton
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
and
told
her
to
report
herself
at
once
to
morrison
wondering
for
what
particular
transgression
she
was
to
be
called
to
account
marjorie
obeyed
and
presented
herself
at
the
study
the
principal
was
seated
at
her
desk
writing
she
allowed
her
pupil
to
stand
and
wait
while
she
finished
making
her
list
for
the
housekeeper
and
blotted
it
then
taking
an
envelope
from
one
of
her
pigeonholes
she
turned
to
the
expectant
girl
marjorie
anderson
she
began
sternly
this
letter
addressed
to
you
arrived
this
morning
miss
norton
very
properly
brought
it
to
me
and
i
have
opened
and
read
it
will
you
kindly
explain
its
contents
the
rule
at
brackenfield
as
at
most
schools
was
that
pupils
might
only
receive
letters
addressed
by
their
parents
or
guardians
and
that
any
other
correspondence
directed
to
them
was
opened
and
perused
by
the
head
mistress
letters
from
brothers
sisters
cousins
or
friends
were
of
course
allowed
if
forwarded
under
cover
by
a
parent
but
must
not
be
sent
separately
to
the
school
by
the
writer
marjorie
in
some
amazement
opened
the
letter
which
morrison
gave
her
it
was
written
on
paper
in
an
hand
and
ran
thus
dear
miss
this
comes
hoping
you
are
as
well
as
it
leaves
me
at
present
i
was
very
glad
to
get
your
letter
and
hear
you
are
thinking
about
me
i
like
your
photo
and
when
i
get
back
to
blighty
should
like
to
keep
company
with
you
if
you
are
agreeable
to
same
before
i
joined
up
i
was
in
the
at
my
works
and
getting
my
a
week
i
am
very
glad
to
have
some
one
to
write
to
me
well
no
more
at
present
from
yours
truly
jim
hargreaves
marjorie
flushed
scarlet
without
doubt
the
letter
was
a
reply
from
the
lonely
soldier
it
came
as
a
tremendous
shock
somehow
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
would
write
back
to
herself
and
the
other
members
of
the
he
had
been
a
mere
picturesque
abstraction
a
romantic
figure
as
remote
as
fiction
whose
loneliness
had
appealed
to
their
sentimental
instincts
they
had
judged
all
soldiers
by
the
experience
of
their
own
brothers
and
cousins
and
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
army
consisted
mostly
of
boys
to
find
that
her
protégé
was
an
uneducated
working
man
who
had
entirely
misconstrued
the
nature
of
her
interest
in
him
and
evidently
imagined
that
she
had
written
him
a
made
poor
marjorie
turn
hot
and
cold
she
was
essentially
a
thorough
little
lady
and
was
at
the
false
position
in
which
her
impulsive
act
had
placed
her
morrison
watched
her
face
narrowly
and
drew
her
own
conclusion
from
the
blushes
do
i
understand
that
this
letter
is
in
reply
to
one
written
by
you
she
asked
yes
morrison
gasped
marjorie
turning
suddenly
white
the
principal
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
trying
to
retain
her
her
grey
eyes
flashed
ominously
and
her
hands
trembled
do
you
understand
that
you
have
not
only
broken
one
of
our
principal
rules
but
have
transgressed
against
the
spirit
of
the
school
every
pupil
here
is
at
least
supposed
to
be
a
gentlewoman
and
that
a
brackenfielder
could
so
demean
herself
as
to
enter
into
a
vulgar
correspondence
with
an
unknown
soldier
fills
me
with
disgust
and
contempt
i
can
not
keep
such
a
girl
in
the
school
you
will
go
for
the
present
to
the
isolation
room
and
remain
there
until
i
can
make
arrangements
to
send
you
home
illustration
then
somehow
marjorie
found
herself
blurting
out
the
entire
story
morrison
spoke
quietly
but
very
firmly
she
pointed
to
the
door
and
marjorie
without
a
word
withdrew
she
had
been
given
no
chance
to
explain
matters
or
defend
herself
by
acknowledging
that
she
had
written
to
private
hargreaves
morrison
considered
that
she
had
pleaded
guilty
and
had
condemned
her
without
further
hearing
as
if
walking
in
a
bad
dream
marjorie
crossed
the
quadrangle
and
went
down
the
path
to
the
isolation
hospital
this
was
a
small
bungalow
in
a
remote
part
of
the
grounds
it
was
kept
always
in
readiness
in
case
any
girl
should
develop
an
infectious
complaint
marjorie
had
been
there
for
a
few
days
last
term
with
a
cold
which
miss
norton
suspected
might
be
influenza
she
had
enjoyed
herself
then
how
different
it
was
now
to
go
there
in
utter
disgrace
and
under
threat
of
expulsion
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
cosy
wicker
chairs
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
to
be
expelled
to
leave
brackenfield
and
all
its
interests
and
to
go
home
with
a
stigma
attached
to
her
name
her
imagination
painted
all
it
would
mean
her
father
displeasure
her
mother
annoyance
the
surprise
of
friends
at
home
to
see
her
back
before
the
entire
humiliation
of
everybody
knowing
that
she
had
been
sent
away
from
school
i
shall
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
again
she
thought
and
it
will
spoil
dona
career
here
too
they
wo
be
able
to
send
joan
to
brackenfield
either
she
have
to
go
to
some
other
school
oh
why
was
i
such
an
absolute
lunatic
i
might
have
known
the
empress
would
take
it
this
way
sister
johnstone
one
of
the
school
nurses
now
came
bustling
in
she
glanced
at
marjorie
but
made
no
remark
and
set
to
work
to
light
the
fire
and
dust
the
room
presently
however
she
came
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
i
do
quite
understand
yet
what
it
all
about
marjorie
she
said
kindly
but
my
advice
is
if
you
done
anything
wrong
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
perhaps
morrison
may
forgive
you
she
expelled
me
groaned
marjorie
that
bad
are
there
any
extenuating
circumstances
but
marjorie
utterly
crushed
and
miserable
only
shook
her
head
the
principal
was
sincerely
concerned
and
grieved
by
the
occurrence
it
is
always
a
blot
on
a
school
to
be
obliged
to
expel
a
pupil
she
talked
the
matter
over
carefully
with
some
of
the
teachers
marjorie
record
at
brackenfield
had
unfortunately
been
already
marred
by
several
incidents
which
prejudiced
her
in
the
eyes
of
the
mistresses
they
had
been
done
innocently
and
in
sheer
thoughtlessness
but
they
gave
a
wrong
impression
of
her
character
miss
norton
related
that
when
she
first
met
marjorie
at
euston
station
she
had
found
her
speaking
to
a
soldier
with
whom
she
had
acknowledged
that
she
had
no
acquaintance
and
that
she
had
brought
a
novel
to
her
dormitory
in
defiance
of
rules
morrison
remembered
only
too
plainly
that
it
was
marjorie
who
had
asked
the
aviator
for
his
autograph
on
the
beach
at
whitecliffe
and
had
started
the
episode
of
snowballing
the
soldiers
judging
by
these
signposts
she
considered
her
tendencies
to
be
fast
i
ca
have
the
atmosphere
of
the
school
spoilt
said
morrison
such
an
attitude
is
only
too
catching
best
to
check
it
before
it
spreads
further
but
i
have
always
found
marjorie
such
a
nice
girl
urged
miss
duckworth
from
my
personal
experience
of
her
i
could
not
have
believed
her
capable
of
unladylike
conduct
she
has
always
seemed
to
me
very
unsophisticated
and
childish
certainly
not
can
there
possibly
be
any
explanation
of
the
matter
i
fear
not
the
case
seems
only
too
plain
sighed
morrison
i
am
very
loath
to
expel
any
girl
but
may
i
speak
to
her
before
you
take
any
active
steps
begged
miss
duckworth
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
matter
may
possibly
admit
of
being
cleared
up
it
worth
trying
no
principal
is
ever
anxious
for
the
unpleasant
task
of
writing
to
a
parent
to
request
her
to
remove
her
daughter
morrison
had
nerved
herself
to
the
unwelcome
duty
but
she
was
quite
willing
to
defer
it
until
miss
duckworth
had
instituted
enquiries
she
had
an
excellent
opinion
of
her
mistress
sound
common
sense
marjorie
spent
a
wretched
day
in
the
isolation
ward
sister
johnstone
plied
her
with
magazines
but
she
had
not
the
heart
to
read
them
and
sat
looking
listlessly
out
of
the
window
at
the
belt
of
laurels
that
separated
the
field
from
the
kitchen
garden
she
wondered
when
she
was
to
leave
brackenfield
if
her
mother
would
come
to
fetch
her
or
if
she
would
have
to
travel
home
by
herself
it
was
after
that
miss
duckworth
entered
i
come
to
relieve
sister
for
a
little
while
she
announced
seating
herself
by
the
fire
sister
johnstone
took
the
hint
and
saying
she
would
be
very
glad
to
go
out
for
half
an
hour
went
away
leaving
miss
duckworth
and
marjorie
alone
in
the
bungalow
come
to
the
fire
marjorie
said
the
mistress
it
damp
and
chilly
this
afternoon
and
you
look
cold
sitting
by
the
window
marjorie
obeyed
almost
mechanically
she
knelt
on
the
rug
and
spread
out
her
hands
to
the
blaze
she
had
reached
a
point
of
misery
when
she
hardly
cared
what
happened
next
to
her
two
big
tears
splashed
into
the
fender
miss
duckworth
suddenly
put
an
arm
round
her
i
sorry
you
in
trouble
marjorie
ca
you
tell
me
why
you
did
such
a
thing
it
so
unlike
you
that
i
do
understand
then
somehow
marjorie
found
herself
blurting
out
the
entire
story
to
her
form
mistress
how
she
had
found
the
soldier
address
at
her
aunt
and
had
written
to
him
in
a
spirit
of
sheer
patriotism
incidentally
and
in
reply
to
questioning
the
aims
and
objects
of
the
were
divulged
miss
duckworth
could
hardly
forbear
a
smile
the
real
circumstances
were
so
utterly
different
from
what
they
appeared
in
the
principal
eyes
you
been
a
very
silly
child
she
said
so
silly
that
i
think
you
richly
deserved
to
get
yourself
into
a
scrape
i
explain
the
matter
to
mrs
morrison
i
like
her
to
know
even
though
i
to
be
expelled
groaned
marjorie
on
hearing
miss
duckworth
version
of
the
story
however
morrison
reconsidered
her
decision
sent
for
the
culprit
lectured
her
and
solemnly
forgave
her
she
further
summoned
all
the
members
of
the
to
present
themselves
in
her
study
in
view
of
the
recent
occurrence
they
came
trembling
and
stood
in
a
downcast
line
while
she
addressed
them
i
hear
from
miss
duckworth
she
said
that
you
have
founded
a
secret
society
among
yourselves
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
patriotism
i
do
not
in
general
approve
of
secret
societies
but
i
sympathize
with
your
object
it
is
the
duty
of
every
citizen
of
our
empire
to
be
patriotic
there
are
various
ways
however
in
which
we
can
show
our
love
for
our
country
let
us
be
sure
that
they
are
wise
and
discreet
ways
before
we
adopt
them
some
forms
of
kindness
may
be
excellent
when
administered
by
and
experienced
women
but
are
not
suitable
for
schoolgirls
if
you
want
to
help
the
soldiers
you
may
sew
i
have
just
received
a
new
consignment
of
flannel
and
will
ask
sister
johnstone
to
cut
some
out
for
you
the
retired
somewhat
crestfallen
i
hate
sewing
mourned
betty
so
do
i
confessed
sylvia
but
we
all
just
have
to
slave
away
at
those
if
we
want
to
square
the
empress
it
must
come
out
of
our
spare
time
too
worse
luck
marjorie
entered
elgiva
in
a
condition
a
hurricane
seemed
to
have
descended
that
morning
whirled
her
almost
to
destruction
then
blown
itself
away
and
left
her
decidedly
battered
by
the
storm
up
in
her
own
cubicle
she
indulged
in
the
luxury
of
a
thorough
good
cry
the
in
a
body
rose
up
to
comfort
her
but
like
jacob
of
old
she
refused
comfort
i
not
to
be
to
have
my
own
postage
stamps
she
sobbed
i
to
take
even
my
home
letters
to
the
empress
to
be
looked
at
and
she
stamp
them
i
to
miss
my
next
exeat
and
aunt
ellinor
to
be
told
the
reason
and
i
not
to
play
hockey
for
a
month
oh
marjorie
then
there
is
the
remotest
chance
of
your
getting
into
the
eleven
for
elgiva
what
a
shame
i
know
it
spoilt
everything
and
the
whole
school
knows
now
about
the
it
leaked
out
somehow
and
the
secret
gone
it
be
no
more
fun
i
wish
to
goodness
i
never
thought
of
it
choked
marjorie
i
got
to
sit
and
copy
out
beastly
poetry
while
somebody
else
gets
into
the
eleven
chapter
xvi
the
observatory
window
though
morrison
might
be
satisfied
that
marjorie
letter
to
private
hargreaves
had
been
written
in
an
excess
of
patriotism
she
made
her
feel
the
ban
of
her
displeasure
she
received
her
coldly
when
she
brought
her
home
letters
to
be
stamped
stopped
her
exeat
and
did
not
remit
a
fraction
of
her
imposition
she
considered
she
had
gauged
marjorie
character
that
thoughtless
impulsiveness
was
one
of
her
gravest
faults
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
teach
her
a
lesson
which
she
would
remember
for
some
time
marjorie
hot
spirits
chafed
against
her
punishment
it
was
terribly
hard
to
be
kept
from
hockey
practice
she
missed
the
physical
exercise
as
well
as
the
excitement
of
the
game
on
three
golden
afternoons
she
had
watched
the
others
run
across
the
shrubbery
towards
the
and
taking
her
dejected
way
to
her
classroom
had
spent
the
time
writing
at
her
desk
the
fourth
hockey
afternoon
was
one
of
those
lovely
spring
days
when
nature
seems
to
beckon
one
out
of
doors
into
the
sunshine
sparrows
were
tweeting
in
the
ivy
and
a
thrush
on
the
top
branch
of
the
almond
tree
trilled
in
rivalry
with
the
blackbird
that
was
building
in
the
holly
bush
for
half
an
hour
marjorie
toiled
away
copying
poetry
is
monotonous
though
perhaps
not
very
exacting
work
she
hated
writing
and
her
head
ached
after
a
morning
spent
at
latin
algebra
and
chemistry
it
seemed
intolerable
to
be
obliged
to
remain
in
the
schoolroom
she
threw
down
her
pen
and
stretched
her
arms
wearily
then
strolled
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
a
belt
of
trees
hid
the
so
it
was
impossible
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
hockey
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
grass
and
bushes
and
a
few
clumps
of
daffodils
which
stood
out
like
golden
stars
against
a
background
of
green
stop
what
was
that
marjorie
looked
more
intently
and
could
distinguish
a
figure
in
hockey
jersey
and
coming
along
behind
the
bushes
as
it
crossed
a
space
between
two
rhododendrons
she
recognized
it
in
a
moment
why
that
chrissie
she
said
to
herself
what
in
the
name
of
thunder
is
she
doing
slinking
behind
the
shrubs
oh
i
know
good
old
girl
she
coming
to
cheer
me
up
and
of
course
does
want
norty
or
anyone
to
catch
her
what
a
sport
she
is
chrissie
had
disappeared
probably
into
the
vestibule
door
but
marjorie
judged
that
she
would
be
coming
upstairs
directly
and
in
a
spirit
of
fun
crouched
down
in
a
corner
and
hid
behind
the
desks
as
she
had
expected
the
door
opened
a
moment
later
and
her
chum
peeped
inside
took
a
hasty
glance
round
the
room
and
went
away
that
she
should
go
without
searching
for
and
finding
her
friend
was
not
at
all
what
marjorie
had
calculated
upon
she
sprang
up
hastily
and
followed
but
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
door
chrissie
had
disappeared
marjorie
walked
a
little
way
along
the
corridor
she
was
disappointed
and
felt
decidedly
bored
with
life
she
longed
for
something
anything
to
break
the
monotony
of
copying
out
poetry
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
staircase
at
her
left
now
on
the
school
plan
these
stairs
were
marked
out
of
bounds
and
to
mount
them
was
a
breach
of
rules
they
led
to
a
glass
observatory
which
formed
a
kind
of
tower
over
the
main
building
of
the
college
a
number
of
theatrical
properties
were
stored
here
screens
and
drop
scenes
and
boxes
full
of
costumes
by
special
leave
the
prefects
came
up
to
fetch
anything
that
was
needed
for
acting
but
to
the
ordinary
school
it
was
forbidden
ground
marjorie
stopped
and
thought
she
had
always
longed
to
explore
the
theatrical
boxes
everybody
was
out
at
hockey
and
there
was
not
a
soul
to
see
her
and
report
her
the
temptation
was
too
great
she
succumbed
and
next
moment
was
running
up
the
stairs
all
agog
with
the
spirit
of
adventure
the
door
of
the
observatory
was
open
it
was
not
a
remarkably
large
room
and
was
fairly
well
filled
with
the
various
stage
properties
large
windows
occupied
the
four
sides
and
the
roof
was
a
glass
dome
marjorie
peeped
about
opened
some
of
the
boxes
and
examined
the
dresses
and
inspected
a
variety
of
odd
objects
such
as
pasteboard
crowns
fairies
wings
sceptres
wands
and
swords
she
was
just
about
to
try
on
a
rumanian
bodice
when
she
turned
in
alarm
steps
were
heard
coming
up
the
staircase
towards
the
observatory
in
an
instant
marjorie
shut
the
box
and
slipped
behind
one
of
the
screens
she
was
only
just
in
time
for
the
next
moment
miss
norton
entered
the
room
through
a
small
rent
in
the
oilcloth
which
covered
the
screen
marjorie
could
see
her
plainly
she
went
to
the
window
which
faced
the
sea
and
gazed
out
long
and
earnestly
then
she
opened
one
of
the
theatrical
boxes
put
something
inside
and
shut
it
again
one
more
look
through
the
window
and
she
left
the
room
the
sound
of
her
retreating
footsteps
died
down
the
stairs
marjorie
had
remained
still
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
she
waited
a
moment
or
two
lest
the
teacher
should
return
then
descended
with
extreme
caution
scuttled
back
into
the
schoolroom
and
started
once
more
to
copy
poetry
it
was
a
near
squeak
she
thought
the
acid
drop
would
have
made
a
fearful
row
if
she
caught
me
it
makes
one
feel
rocky
even
to
think
of
it
oh
dear
i
must
brace
up
if
i
to
get
all
the
rest
of
this
done
before
tea
she
wrote
away
wearily
until
the
rang
then
washed
her
hands
and
went
into
the
hall
the
one
topic
of
conversation
at
the
tables
was
hockey
the
points
of
the
various
members
of
the
teams
were
criticized
freely
it
appeared
to
have
been
an
exciting
afternoon
a
sense
of
ill
usage
filled
marjorie
that
she
had
not
been
present
i
think
the
empress
was
awfully
hard
on
me
she
groused
i
believe
she
have
let
me
off
more
lightly
if
norty
had
given
her
such
a
list
of
my
crimes
i
wish
i
could
catch
norty
tripping
but
teachers
never
do
trip
why
no
of
course
not
they
would
be
teachers
if
they
did
laughed
betty
the
empress
would
soon
pack
them
off
i
wonder
if
they
ever
get
into
trouble
and
the
empress
reprimands
them
in
private
surmised
chrissie
oh
that
likely
enough
but
of
course
we
do
hear
about
it
miss
gordon
and
miss
hulton
had
a
quarrel
last
year
said
sylvia
yes
and
miss
hulton
left
everybody
said
she
was
obliged
to
go
because
morrison
took
miss
gordon
part
that
evening
an
unprecedented
and
extraordinary
thing
happened
brackenfield
college
stood
in
a
dip
of
the
hills
not
very
far
away
from
the
sea
as
at
most
coast
places
the
rules
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitecliffe
were
exceedingly
strict
not
the
least
little
chink
of
a
light
must
be
visible
after
dusk
and
blinds
and
curtains
were
drawn
most
carefully
over
the
windows
being
on
the
west
coast
they
had
so
far
been
immune
from
air
raids
but
in
nobody
knew
from
what
quarter
danger
might
come
or
whether
a
stray
zeppelin
might
some
night
float
overhead
or
a
cruiser
begin
shelling
the
town
on
the
whole
the
college
was
considered
as
safe
a
place
as
any
in
england
and
parents
had
not
scrupled
to
send
their
daughters
back
to
school
there
on
this
particular
evening
one
of
the
housemaids
had
been
into
whitecliffe
and
instead
of
returning
by
the
high
road
and
up
the
drive
took
a
short
cut
by
the
side
lane
and
the
kitchen
garden
to
her
amazement
she
noticed
that
in
one
of
the
windows
of
the
observatory
a
bright
light
was
shining
it
was
on
the
side
away
from
the
high
road
but
facing
the
sea
and
could
probably
be
discerned
at
a
great
distance
she
hurried
indoors
and
informed
morrison
who
at
once
visited
the
observatory
and
found
there
a
lighted
bicycle
lamp
which
had
been
placed
on
the
window
sill
so
sinister
an
incident
was
a
matter
for
immediate
enquiry
the
principal
was
girls
teachers
and
servants
were
questioned
but
nobody
admitted
anything
the
lamp
indeed
proved
to
be
one
which
miss
duckworth
had
missed
from
her
bicycle
several
days
before
it
was
known
that
she
had
been
lamenting
its
loss
whether
the
light
had
been
put
as
a
signal
or
as
a
practical
joke
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
if
it
had
been
noticed
by
a
special
constable
it
would
have
placed
brackenfield
in
danger
of
an
exceedingly
heavy
fine
everybody
was
extremely
indignant
it
was
felt
that
such
an
unpleasant
episode
cast
a
reflection
upon
the
school
it
was
naturally
the
one
subject
of
conversation
have
we
a
spy
in
our
midst
asked
winifrede
mason
darkly
if
it
really
was
a
practical
joke
then
whoever
did
it
needs
hounding
out
of
the
place
she
meet
with
scant
mercy
when
she
found
agreed
meg
hutchinson
marjorie
said
nothing
at
all
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
the
events
of
the
afternoon
rose
up
like
a
spectre
and
haunted
her
she
felt
she
needed
a
confidante
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
she
sought
chrissie
alone
and
told
her
how
she
had
run
up
into
the
observatory
and
seen
miss
norton
there
do
you
think
it
possible
norty
could
have
lighted
that
lamp
she
asked
chrissie
whistled
it
looks
rather
black
against
her
certainly
what
was
she
doing
up
in
the
observatory
she
put
something
inside
a
box
did
you
see
what
it
was
no
it
might
have
been
a
bicycle
lamp
it
might
have
been
anything
as
far
as
i
can
tell
did
she
strike
a
match
as
if
lighting
a
lamp
no
but
of
course
she
might
have
put
the
lamp
inside
the
box
and
then
come
up
at
dusk
to
light
it
chrissie
shook
her
head
and
whistled
again
softly
she
appeared
to
be
thinking
ought
i
to
tell
the
empress
ventured
marjorie
not
unless
you
want
to
get
yourself
into
the
very
biggest
row
ever
had
in
your
life
why
why
do
you
see
you
silly
child
that
norty
would
deny
everything
and
throw
all
the
blame
upon
you
naturally
the
empress
would
ask
were
you
doing
in
the
observatory
even
if
she
did
suspect
you
of
putting
the
light
there
yourself
which
it
is
quite
possible
she
might
she
punish
you
for
breaking
bounds
and
when
you
only
just
been
in
trouble
already
it
not
to
be
thought
of
interrupted
marjorie
quickly
you
quite
right
chrissie
the
empress
would
be
sure
to
side
with
norty
and
blame
me
i
thought
of
going
and
telling
her
and
i
even
walked
as
far
as
the
study
door
but
i
was
too
frightened
to
knock
i
glad
i
asked
you
about
it
first
of
course
the
whole
business
may
be
a
rag
it
the
kind
of
wild
thing
some
of
those
silly
juniors
would
do
it
may
but
on
the
other
hand
the
light
may
have
been
a
signal
it
seems
very
mysterious
do
tell
anybody
else
what
you
told
me
rather
not
it
a
secret
to
be
kept
even
from
the
i

a
word
to
a
single
soul
chapter
xvii
the
dance
of
the
nations
though
morrison
made
the
most
rigid
enquiries
she
could
get
no
information
as
to
who
had
placed
the
lamp
in
the
window
she
locked
the
door
of
the
observatory
and
caused
the
old
gardener
to
patrol
the
grounds
at
intervals
after
dark
to
watch
for
further
signals
but
nothing
more
occurred
after
weeks
of
vigilance
and
suspicion
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
have
been
a
practical
joke
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
girls
chrissie
in
her
private
talks
with
her
chum
upheld
that
view
of
the
matter
but
marjorie
had
her
own
opinions
she
often
looked
at
miss
norton
and
wondered
what
secrets
were
hidden
under
that
calm
exterior
to
all
outward
appearance
the
house
mistress
was
scholastic
cold
and
entirely
occupied
with
her
duties
she
was
essentially
a
disciplinarian
and
kept
elgiva
under
a
strict
régime
her
girls
often
wished
she
were
less
conscientious
in
her
superintendence
of
their
doings
the
possession
of
a
mutual
secret
shared
by
themselves
alone
seemed
to
draw
chrissie
and
marjorie
closer
together
than
ever
not
that
chrissie
gave
her
chum
any
more
of
her
real
confidence
for
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
who
never
reveals
her
heart
but
she
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
interested
in
marjorie
affairs
she
enjoyed
the
latter
home
news
and
especially
letters
from
the
front
i
envy
you
with
three
brothers
in
the
army
she
admitted
one
day
with
a
wistful
sigh
yes
it
something
to
know
our
family
is
doing
its
bit
returned
marjorie
proudly
have
you
any
relations
at
the
front
she
added
chrissie
shook
her
head
my
father
is
dead
and
my
only
brother
is
delicate
marjorie
forbore
to
press
the
question
further
she
could
see
it
was
a
tender
subject
probably
the
brother
is
a
shirker
or
a
conscientious
objector
she
thought
and
to
such
a
patriotic
girl
as
chrissie
it
must
be
a
dreadful
trial
if
bevis
or
leonard
or
larry
seemed
to
hang
back
i
die
of
shame
judging
from
the
photo
of
chrissie
brother
which
stood
on
her
he
did
not
look
an
engaging
or
interesting
youth
the
dormitory
keenly
critical
of
each
other
relatives
had
privately
decided
in
his
disfavour
that
chrissie
was
fond
of
him
marjorie
was
sure
though
she
never
talked
about
him
and
his
doings
as
other
girls
did
of
their
brothers
the
suspicion
that
her
chum
was
hiding
a
secret
humiliation
on
this
score
made
marjorie
doubly
kind
and
chrissie
though
no
more
expansive
than
formerly
seemed
to
understand
she
was
evidently
intensely
grateful
for
marjorie
friendship
and
as
entirely
devoted
to
her
as
her
reserved
disposition
allowed
she
would
send
to
whitecliffe
for
violets
and
place
the
little
bunch
on
her
chum
flushing
hotly
when
she
was
thanked
she
presented
innumerable
small
gifts
which
she
managed
to
make
in
her
spare
time
she
was
a
quick
and
exquisite
needlewoman
and
dainty
collars
in
broderie
anglaise
embroidered
mats
and
other
pretty
trifles
seemed
to
grow
like
magic
under
her
nimble
fingers
any
return
present
from
marjorie
she
seemed
to
value
exceedingly
she
put
the
latter
photo
inside
a
locket
and
wore
it
constantly
she
was
clever
at
her
lessons
and
would
help
her
chum
with
her
work
out
of
school
hours
elgiva
smiled
tolerantly
and
named
the
pair
the
turtle
doves
though
the
atmosphere
of
the
hostel
was
not
sentimental
violent
friendships
were
not
unknown
there
sometimes
they
were
of
enduring
quality
and
sometimes
they
ended
in
a
quarrel
miss
norton
did
not
encourage
demonstrative
affection
among
her
flock
but
it
was
known
that
morrison
considered
schoolgirl
friendships
highly
important
and
likely
to
last
for
life
she
beamed
rather
than
frowned
on
those
who
walked
arm
in
arm
marjorie
second
term
at
brackenfield
was
fast
wearing
itself
away
in
spite
of
many
disagreeable
happenings
she
felt
that
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
life
of
the
school
and
that
she
was
a
definite
figure
at
elgiva
there
was
a
little
rivalry
between
the
hostels
and
each
would
try
to
outdo
the
other
in
such
matters
as
collecting
for
charities
knitting
for
the
soldiers
or
providing
items
for
concerts
at
the
end
of
term
each
hostel
put
up
in
the
hall
a
list
of
its
various
achievements
and
great
was
the
triumph
of
that
house
which
could
record
the
largest
number
of
socks
or
shillings
there
was
an
old
and
custom
that
on
the
last
three
evenings
of
term
the
three
hostels
in
turn
might
take
possession
of
the
assembly
hall
and
give
some
form
of
entertainment
to
which
they
could
invite
the
rest
of
the
school
elgiva
held
a
committee
meeting
to
discuss
possible
projects
there
does
seem
anything
new
mourned
mollie
of
course
concerts
and
plays
and
charades
are
very
well
in
their
way
but
they
done
every
time
we
all
like
them
admitted
phyllis
oh
yes
we
like
them
but
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
a
change
ca
anybody
make
a
suggestion
urged
francie
the
things
we
really
want
to
do
are
just
the
things
we
ca
sighed
betty
if
i
could
choose
i
vote
for
a
bonfire
and
fireworks
or
a
torchlight
picnic
prompted
sylvia
it
would
make
a
nice
excitement
for
the
special
constables
to
come
and
arrest
us
as
they
most
certainly
would
what
a
heading
it
would
make
for
the
newspaper
ladies
school
in
prison
no
bail
allowed
would
they
set
us
to
pick
oakum
but
seriously
do
think
of
something
practical
have
your
brains
all
gone
rusty
there
are
progressive
games
ventured
patricia
githa
are
giving
them
i
know
it
for
a
fact
they
sent
to
whitecliffe
for
marbles
and
boxes
of
pins
and
to
make
they
get
first
innings
so
it
would
be
too
stale
if
our
evening
were
to
be
just
a
repetition
of
theirs
it
was
chrissie
who
at
last
made
the
original
suggestion
could
we
have
a
dance
i
do
mean
an
ordinary
dance
but
something
special
suppose
we
were
all
to
dress
up
to
represent
different
nations
we
could
have
all
the
allies
ripping
but
how
could
we
manage
enough
costumes
we
make
them
up
with
coloured
paper
and
ribbons
it
should
be
very
difficult
it
a
jolly
good
idea
said
mollie
reflectively
the
more
the
committee
considered
the
matter
the
more
they
felt
disposed
to
decide
in
favour
of
the
dance
they
consulted
miss
norton
on
the
subject
and
she
proved
unusually
genial
and
encouraging
and
offered
to
take
two
delegates
with
her
to
whitecliffe
to
buy
requisites
the
girls
drew
lots
for
the
honour
and
the
luck
fell
to
mollie
and
phyllis
they
had
an
exciting
afternoon
at
the
stores
and
came
back
laden
with
parcels
miss
norton
says
the
fairest
plan
will
be
to
have
the
things
on
sale
they
announced
we
going
to
turn
the
into
a
shop
and
you
may
each
come
in
one
by
one
and
spend
a
shilling
but
no
more
all
serene
when
will
you
be
at
the
receipt
of
custom
this
evening
after
supper
that
day
there
had
been
in
the
library
a
tremendous
run
upon
any
books
which
gave
illustrations
of
european
costumes
the
girls
considered
that
either
allegorical
or
native
peasant
dresses
would
be
suitable
they
took
drawings
and
wrote
down
details
what
i
like
would
be
to
write
to
london
to
a
firm
of
theatrical
providers
and
tell
them
to
send
us
down
a
consignment
of
costumes
announced
patricia
oh
i
dare
say
a
nice
little
bill
we
should
have
i
hired
costumes
before
and
they
charge
a
terrific
amount
for
them
commented
francie
it
rather
fun
to
make
our
own
especially
when
we
all
limited
the
same
as
to
material
maintained
nora
the
girls
usually
did
needlework
after
supper
but
this
evening
the
was
to
be
devoted
to
the
sale
mollie
and
phyllis
were
wise
in
their
generation
and
anticipating
a
stampede
they
picked
out
gertrude
holmes
and
laura
norris
as
being
the
most
stalwart
and
among
the
damsels
of
elgiva
and
set
them
to
keep
the
door
admitting
only
two
at
a
time
even
with
this
precaution
a
rather
wild
scene
ensued
instead
of
keeping
in
an
orderly
queue
the
girls
pushed
for
places
and
there
were
several
excited
struggles
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stairs
as
each
girl
came
out
proudly
exhibiting
what
she
had
purchased
the
anxiety
of
those
who
had
not
yet
entered
the
increased
they
were
afraid
everything
might
be
sold
before
it
came
to
their
turns
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
muscles
of
gertrude
and
laura
the
fort
might
have
been
stormed
and
the
stores
raided
mollie
and
phyllis
had
invested
their
capital
with
skill
and
showed
an
assortment
of
white
and
coloured
crinkled
papers
cheap
remnants
of
sateen
lengths
of
gay
butter
muslin
and
yards
of
ribbon
for
the
occasion
they
assumed
the
manners
of
shop
assistants
and
greeted
their
visitors
with
the
orthodox
what
can
i
show
you
madam
but
their
elaborate
politeness
soon
melted
away
when
the
customer
showed
signs
of
demanding
more
than
her
portion
and
the
oh
certainly
or
here
a
sweet
thing
madam
uttered
in
honeyed
tones
turned
to
a
blunt
be
greedy
ca
give
you
more
than
your
shilling
worth
not
if
you
ask
ever
so
there
wo
be
enough
to
go
round
so
you
must
just
make
what
you
got
do
not
a
single
inch
more
if
you
do
go
this
minute
we
take
your
parcels
back
we
in
a
hurry
by
using
the
greatest
dispatch
mollie
and
phyllis
just
managed
to
distribute
their
goods
before
the
bell
rang
for
prayers
the
ribbon
and
sateen
were
all
bought
up
and
the
crinkled
paper
which
was
left
over
they
put
aside
to
make
decorations
for
the
hall
next
day
elgiva
was
given
up
to
the
fabrication
of
costumes
the
girls
retired
to
their
dormitories
strewed
their
beds
with
materials
and
worked
feverishly
in
no
the
excitement
was
intense
sylvia
who
intended
to
represent
the
united
states
was
seccotining
stars
and
stripes
cut
out
of
coloured
paper
on
to
her
best
white
petticoat
betty

stitching
red
stripes
down
the
sides
of
her

knickers

determined
to
appear
in
the

she
could

here
in
my
album
that
we
could
copy
look
it
just
the
thing
the
big
cap
and
the
white
sleeves
would
do
beautifully
in
crinkled
paper
and
i
lend
you
that
velvet
bodice
i
wore
when
i
was
how
about
the
apron
stitch
two
handkerchiefs
together
pick
the
lace
off
your
best
petticoat
and
sew
it
round
and
you
have
the
jinkiest
little
breton
apron
you
ever
saw
christina
lang
you
a
genius
exclaimed
marjorie
pulling
out
the
best
petticoat
from
under
a
pile
of
blouses
in
her
drawer
and
setting
to
work
with
sylvia
embroidery
scissors
to
detach
the
trimming
you
want
a
necklace
and
some
earrings
decided
chrissie
oh
easily

you
break
up
a
string
of
beads

a
few
of
them
and
tie
them
on
to
your
ears

guarantee

turn

peasant

in
my
hands

suppose

be
expected
to
talk
breton
chuckled
marjorie
the
seniors
entertainment
came
first
and
on
the
following
evening
intermediates
and
juniors
assembled
in
the
big
hall
as
the
guests
of
githa
progressive
games
had
been
provided
and
the
company
spent
a
hilarious
hour
fishing
up
with
bent
pins
picking
up
marbles
with
two
pencils
or
securing
potatoes
with
a
number
of
pretty
prizes
were
given
and
the
hostesses
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
perfectly
sure
that
their
visitors
to
judge
by
their
behaviour
had
absolutely
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
githa
had
undoubtedly
covered
itself
with
glory
and
elgiva
must
not
be
outdone
the
intermediates
worked
feverishly
to
finish
their
costumes
such
an
amount
of
borrowing
and
lending
went
on
that
it
would
be
quite
a
problem
to
sort
out
possessions
afterwards
it
was
a
point
of
etiquette
that
anyone
who
had
anything
that
would
be
useful
to
a
was
bound
in
honour
to
offer
the
loan
of
it
only
the
hostesses
were
to
be
in
costume
the
guests
were
to
appear
in
ordinary
evening
dresses
marjorie
before
the
mirror
in
her
bedroom
gazed
critically
at
her
own
reflection
chrissie
clever
fingers
had
pulled
and
twisted
the
crinkled
paper
into
the
most
becoming
of
peasant
caps
the
large
bead
tied
on
with
silk
jangled
on
to
her
neck
her
paper
sleeves
stood
out
like
lawn
the
apron
was
a
triumph
of
daintiness
she
wore
patricia
with
betty
black
silk
stockings
do
you
think
i
do
she
queried
the
zouave
officer
threw
herself
on
one
knee
in
an
attitude
of
ecstatic
admiration
and
laid
a
hand
upon
her
heart
do
you
ravishing
i
going
to
make
love
to
you
all
the
evening
just
for
the
sport
of
seeing
the
acid
drop
face
play
up
and
flirt
wo
you
you
look
a
regular
don
juan
chuckled
marjorie
that
my
rôle
this
evening
i
going
to
break
hearts
by
the
dozen
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
mean
to
dance
with
norty
herself
elgiva
might
certainly
congratulate
itself
upon
the
success
of
its
efforts
the
fancy
costumes
produced
a
sensation
all
the
allies
were
represented
as
well
as
allegorical
figures
such
as
britannia
justice
peace
and
plenty
it
was
marvellous
how
much
had
been
accomplished
with
the
very
scanty
materials
that
the
girls
had
had
to
work
upon
the
ball
was
soon
in
full
swing
mistresses
and
prefects
joined
in
the
fun
and
found
themselves
being
whirled
round
by
neapolitan
contadini
or
picturesque
japs
the
room
decorated
with
flags
and
big
rosettes
of
coloured
paper
looked
delightfully
festive
even
miss
norton
usually
the
climax
of
dignity
thawed
for
the
occasion
and
accepted
invitation
to
a
without
expressing
any
disapproval
of
the
zouave
uniform
marjorie
after
a
vigorous
of
exercise
paused
panting
near
the
platform
and
refused
further
partners
i
want
a
rest
she
proclaimed
you
would
believe
it
but
this
costume
very
hot
and
my
keep
smacking
me
in
the
face
if
you
not
want
to
dance
marjorie
you
shall
play
and
i
take
a
turn
suggested
the
french
mistress
vacating
the
piano
stool
by
all
means
mademoiselle
do
go
and
dance
there
elsie
wanting
a
partner
i
enjoy
playing
for
a
while
what
pieces
have
you
got
here
oh
i
know
most
of
them
marjorie
settled
herself
to
the
piano
she
was
an
excellent
reader
so
could
manage
even
the
pieces
with
which
she
was
not
already
acquainted
she
was
playing
a
and
turning
her
head
to
watch
the
dancers
as
they
whirled
by
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
shout
and
chrissie
who
was
passing
scrambled
on
to
the
platform
dragged
her
from
the
piano
threw
her
on
the
floor
and
sat
upon
her
head
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
her
chum
extraordinary
conduct
marjorie
was
too
much
amazed
even
to
scream
when
chrissie
released
her
she
realized
what
had
happened
she
had
put
the
corner
of
her
large
breton
cap
into
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
it
had
flared
up
only
her
friend
prompt
action
could
have
saved
her
from
being
horribly
burnt
as
it
was
her
hair
was
slightly
singed
but
her
face
was
unscathed
the
girls
thoroughly
alarmed
came
crowding
on
to
the
platform
and
miss
norton
after
blowing
out
the
piano
candles
examined
her
carefully
to
see
the
extent
of
the
damage
more
frightened
than
hurt
was
her
verdict
but
another
second
might
have
been
too
late
i
must
congratulate
you
chrissie
on
your
presence
of
mind
chrissie
flushed
crimson
it
was
not
often
that
miss
norton
congratulated
anybody
praise
from
her
was
praise
indeed
please
go
on
dancing
begged
marjorie
i
all
right
only
i
think
i
sit
still
and
watch
it
made
my
legs
feel
shaky
i
never
thought
of
the
candle
and
the
size
of
my
cap
it
spoilt
your
costume
said
sylvia
commiseratingly
and
yours
was
the
best
in
all
the
room
everybody
been
saying
so
i
wanted
to
get
a
snapshot
of
you
in
it
take
betty
instead
she
the
limit
in
that
zouave
and
if
you
would
mind
using
an
extra
film
i
like
one
of
chrissie
chrissie
marjorie
caught
her
breath
in
a
little
gasp
has
saved
my
life
chapter
xviii
enchanted
ground
marjorie
and
dona
spent
the
larger
part
of
the
easter
holidays
with
an
aunt
in
the
north
they
had
a
few
days
at
home
mostly
devoted
to
visits
to
the
dentist
and
the
dressmaker
and
then
boxes
were
once
more
packed
and
they
started
off
on
the
now
familiar
journey
back
to
brackenfield
joan
watched
the
preparations
wistfully
do
you
think
the
empress
would
take
a
girl
of
eight
she
enquired
in
all
seriousness
not
unless
you
could
be
used
as
a
mascot
or
a
school
monkey
returned
marjorie
you
might
come
in
handy
at
the
nursing
lectures
when
we
get
to
the
chapter
on
to
wash
and
dress
a
baby
or
you
do
to
practise
bandaging
on
otherwise
you
be
considerably
in
the
way
do
be
horrid
pouted
joan
i
to
go
to
brackenfield
some
time
mother
said
so
you
have
to
wait
five
years
yet
my
hearty
why
do
you
know
even
dona
is
called
a
kiddie
at
brackenfield
dona
joan
eyes
were
big
yes
some
of
the
girls
look
almost
as
old
as
nora
and
they
turned
up
their
hair
it
a
fact
you
need
stare
you
go
all
in
good
time
poor
old
baba
said
dona
you
like
to
be
in
a
form
all
by
yourself
without
any
other
little
girls
and
there
no
room
for
a
preparatory
unless
they
build
and
that
not
possible
in
you
must
peg
on
for
a
while
with
miss
hazelwood
and
then
perhaps
mother
send
you
to
a
day
school
after
all
you
know
it
something
to
be
the
youngest
in
the
family
you
score
over
that
both
marjorie
and
dona
were
looking
forward
to
the
summer
term
those
of
their
chums
who
were
old
brackenfielders
had
dwelt
strongly
on
its
advantages
compared
with
the
autumn
or
spring
terms
it
was
the
season
for
cricket
and
tennis
for
country
walks
picnics
and
natural
history
excursions
most
of
the
activities
were
arranged
for
out
of
doors
and
a
larger
amount
of
liberty
was
allowed
the
girls
than
had
been
possible
during
the
period
of
short
days
armed
each
with
a
cricket
bat
and
a
tennis
racket
not
to
mention
cameras
butterfly
nets
and
botanical
cases
they
arrived
at
their
respective
hostels
and
unpacked
their
possessions
marjorie
was
the
last
comer
in
no
and
found
chrissie
with
her
cubicle
already
neatly
arranged
sylvia
with
her
head
buried
in
her
bottom
drawer
and
betty
struggling
with
straps
the
two
latter
were
pouring
out
details
of
their
holiday
adventures
i
rode
in
to
town
every
day
and
did
mother
shopping
for
her
and
we
went
to
a
sale
and
bought
the
jolliest
little
governess
car
and
harness
we
were
going
to
brighton
only
mother
was
so
afraid
of
bombs
on
the
south
coast
so
daddy
said
it
was
safer
to
stop
at
home
and
i
was
glad
because
we
spent
last
christmas
at
grannie
so
i
really
had
seen
very
much
of
home
dick
got
a
week
leave
and
we
an
absolutely
gorgeous
time
james
and
vincent
brought
two
school
friends
home
with
them
such
ripping
boys
we
went
out
boating
on
the
lake
and
we
went
to
the
cinema
nearly
every
day
what
have
you
been
doing
marjorie
asked
chrissie
heaps
of
things
we
were
staying
at
redferne
and
uncle
showed
us
all
over
the
munition
works
they
so
strict
they
wo
let
anybody
go
through
now
but
uncle
the
head
so
of
course
he
could
take
dona
and
me
and
we
saw
a
belgian
town
for
the
belgian
workers
there
it
built
quite
separately
and
has
entanglements
round
there
are
a
thousand
houses
and
six
hundred
hostels
and
ever
so
many
huts
as
well
and
shops
and
a
post
office
and
a
hall
of
justice
you
ca
go
in
through
the
gate
without
a
pass
but
uncle
knew
the
manager
so
it
was
all
right
i
do
call
that
as
much
fun
as
boating
said
betty
or
the
cinema
added
sylvia
it
was
nicer
because
it
was
patriotic
retorted
marjorie
i
like
to
see
what
the
country
is
doing
for
the
war
you
two
think
of
nothing
but
silly
jokes
do
show
temper
my
child
observed
betty
blandly
sylvia
going
down
at
once
to
put
my
name
on
the
cricket
list
i
finish
my
unpacking
afterwards
i
come
with
you
said
sylvia
we
sha
get
an
innings
unless
we
sign
on
straight
away
they
a
couple
of
laughed
chrissie
as
their
made
their
exit
executing
a
i
do
believe
they
ever
think
seriously
about
anything
never
mind
old
sport
interested
in
what
you
do
in
the
holidays
tell
me
some
more
about
the
munition
works
and
the
belgian
town
i
like
to
hear
all
you
seen
i
wish
i
could
go
to
redferne
myself
you
would
see
anything
if
you
did
because
only
uncle
can
take
people
round
the
works
oh
it
was
wonderful
we
went
into
the
danger
zone
and
we
saw
girls
with
their
faces
all
yellow
i
have
time
to
tell
you
half
now
but
i
will
afterwards
i
would
have
missed
it
for
the
world
it
does
one
good
to
know
what
going
on
commented
chrissie
the
daylight
saving
act
was
now
in
operation
so
the
school
had
an
extra
hour
available
for
outdoor
exercise
whenever
the
weather
was
fine
enough
they
were
encouraged
to
spend
every
available
moment
in
the
fresh
air
a
certain
amount
of
cricket
practice
was
compulsory
but
for
the
rest
of
the
time
those
who
liked
might
play
tennis
or
basket
ball
or
could
stroll
about
the
grounds
select
parties
under
the
leadership
of
a
mistress
were
taken
botanizing
or
to
hunt
for
specimens
on
the
beach
there
was
keen
competition
for
these
rambles
and
as
eligibility
depended
upon
marks
in
the
science
classes
it
considerably
raised
the
standard
of
work
dona
who
was
rather
dull
at
ordinary
lessons
shone
in
natural
history
it
was
her
one
subject
she
wrote
her
notes
neatly
and
would
make
beautiful
little
drawings
to
illustrate
the
various
points
she
had
sharp
eyes
and
when
out
on
a
ramble
would
spy
birds
nests
or
other
treasures
which
nobody
else
had
noticed
and
knew
all
the
likeliest
places
in
which
to
look
for
caterpillars
she
was
a
great
favourite
with
miss
carter
the
science
mistress
and
her
name
was
almost
always
down
on
the
excursion
list
one
day
in
company
with
eleven
other
ardent
naturalists
and
the
mistress
she
came
toiling
up
from
the
beach
on
to
the
road
that
led
to
whitecliffe
her
basket
filled
with
spoils
from
the
rocks
and
pools
was
rather
a
dripping
object
her
shoes
were
full
of
sand
and
she
was
tired
but
cheery
she
had
hurried
on
and
reached
the
summit
first
quite
some
way
in
advance
of
her
companions
as
she
stood
waiting
for
them
she
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
footsteps
and
round
the
corner
came
a
girl
wheeling
a
long
perambulator
with
a
child
in
it
there
was
no
mistaking
the
couple
they
were
the
nursemaid
and
the
little
boy
whom
dona
and
marjorie
had
met
on
the
cliffs
last
autumn
lizzie
looked
just
the
same
rosy
and
untidy
as
ever
but
it
was
a
very
etherealized
eric
who
lay
in
the
perambulator
the
lovely
little
face
looked
white
and
transparent
as
alabaster
the
brown
eyes
seemed
bigger
and
more
wistful
the
golden
curls
had
grown
and
framed
the
pale
cheeks
like
a
saint
halo
the
small
hands
folded
on
the
shabby
rug
were
thin
and
colourless
the
child
was
wasted
almost
to
a
shadow
and
the
blue
veins
on
his
forehead
showed
prominently
he
recognized
dona
at
once
and
for
a
moment
a
beautiful
rosy
flush
flooded
his
pathetic
little
face
oh
lizzie
it
my
fairy
lady
he
cried
excitedly
the
nurse
girl
stopped
in
amazement
well
now
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
she
said
to
dona
been
talking
about
you
all
the
winter
he
been
awful
bad
he
has
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
him
out
for
months
he
still
got
that
book
you
gave
him
i
should
think
he
knows
every
story
in
it
off
by
heart
dona
was
bending
over
the
carriage
holding
the
frail
little
hand
that
eric
offered
you
silverstar
he
said
gazing
up
at
her
with
keen
satisfaction
where
are
bluebell
and
princess
goldilocks
they
not
here
oh
i
do
so
want
to
see
them
they
be
sorry
to
miss
you
he
talk
of
nothing
else
now
observed
lizzie
you
would
believe
what
a
fancy
he
taken
to
you
three
and
he
a
queer
child
he
does
like
everybody
i
want
to
see
the
others
repeated
eric
with
the
suspicion
of
a
wail
in
his
voice
look
here
said
dona
hastily
our
exeat
day
can
you
bring
him
to
that
place
on
the
cliffs
where
we
met
before
we
be
there
at
four
all
of
us
you
can
leave
him
with
us
if
you
want
to
go
shopping
now
i
must
fly
for
my
teacher
calling
me
we
be
there
smiled
eric
waving
a
that
if
your
ma
says
you
well
enough
added
lizzie
cautiously
before
preparation
dona
sought
out
marjorie
and
told
her
of
the
meeting
with
the
little
boy
we
just
got
to
be
on
the
cliff
she
said
i
disappoint
that
child
for
a
thousand
pounds
auntie
would
send
hodson
with
us
i
sure
if
elaine
ca
go
i
so
glad
you
happened
to
see
him
we
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
poor
little
chap
by
the
by
could
we
take
him
something
i
thought
of
that
we
fly
down
to
whitecliffe
first
thing
after
we
get
to
auntie
and
buy
him
a
book
at
the
stores
i
hope
to
goodness
it
be
a
fine
day
or
perhaps
they
wo
let
him
come
i
believe
he
cry
his
eyes
out
if
they
do
he
tremendously
set
on
it
very
fortunately
the
weather
on
wednesday
was
all
that
could
be
desired
marjorie
and
dona
rushed
into
the
tamarisks
in
quite
a
state
of
excitement
and
both
together
poured
out
their
information
elaine
was
as
interested
as
they
to
meet
eric
again
and
readily
agreed
to
the
proposed
expedition
we
take
some
cake
and
milk
with
us
and
have
a
little
picnic
she
suggested
let
us
tear
down
to
whitecliffe
at
once
and
buy
him
a
present
shortly
before
four
the
three
girls
carrying
a
and
several
parcels
were
walking
along
the
cliffs
above
the
cove
the
long
perambulator
was
already
waiting
at
the
and
eric
propped
up
with
pillows
smiled
a
welcome
elaine
was
shocked
to
see
how
ill
the
child
looked
he
had
been
frail
enough
in
the
autumn
but
now
the
poor
little
body
seemed
only
a
transparent
garment
through
which
the
soul
shone
plainly
she
greeted
him
brightly
but
with
an
ache
in
her
heart
my
princess
he
said
so
you
come
back
to
me
at
last
and
fairy
bluebell
too
oh
i
wanted
you
all
it
been
a
weary
winter
the
gnomes
kept
me
shut
up
in
their
hill
all
the
time
they
would
let
me
out
perhaps
they
were
afraid
the
witches
might
catch
you
answered
marjorie
yes
i
expect
that
was
partly
it
but
the
gnomes
are
jealous
and
like
to
guard
me
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
titania
did
she
come
to
see
you
sometimes
she
ca
come
often
because
she
so
busy
she
got
crowds
of
young
fairies
to
look
after
and
keep
in
order
and
sometimes
they
naughty
you
would
believe
fairies
could
be
naughty
could
you
i
suppose
there
are
good
and
bad
ones
laughed
dona
he
just
silly
over
fairies
broke
in
lizzie
talks
of
nothing
else
and
makes
out
we
all
witches
or
pixies
or
what
not
well
eric
got
to
go
and
buy
some
butter
will
you
be
good
if
i
leave
you
here
till
i
come
back
i
sha
be
above
half
an
hour
or
so
she
added
to
the
girls
do
hurry
replied
elaine
we
can
stay
until
five
brought
our
tea
if
eric
may
have
some
with
us
may
he
eat
cake
oh
yes
he
tell
you
what
he
may
eat
wo
you
eric
the
little
fellow
nodded
his
eyes
were
shining
i
did
know
it
was
to
be
a
fairy
feast
he
murmured
softly
half
to
himself
the
girls
were
busy
unpacking
their
parcels
they
had
brought
several
presents
which
they
thought
would
amuse
the
child
during
the
long
hours
he
probably
spent
in
bed
a
puzzle
a
a
box
of
coloured
chalks
a
and
a
lovely
volume
of
new
fairy
tales
his
delight
was
pathetic
he
looked
at
each
separately
and
touched
it
with
a
finger
as
if
it
were
a
great
treasure
the
fairy
book
with
its
coloured
pictures
of
gnomes
and
pixies
he
clasped
tightly
in
his
arms
it
as
good
as
having
a
birthday
he
sighed
i
had
mine
a
while
ago
titania
could
come
to
see
me
because
the
young
fairies
had
to
be
looked
after
but
she
sent
me
a
paint
box
i
wish
you
knew
titania
i
wish
we
did
what
she
like
she
the
beautifullest
person
in
all
the
world
nobody
else
can
play
fairies
as
well
as
she
can
and
she
can
tell
a
new
story
every
time
you
just
fall
straight
in
love
with
her
if
you
saw
her
i
know
you
would
it
a
pity
fairies
have
to
be
so
busy
is
it
some
day
when
i
better
and
she
has
time
she
going
to
take
me
away
for
a
holiday
think
of
going
away
with
titania
the
doctor
says
i
must
drink
my
medicine
if
i
want
to
get
well
do
you
like
medicine
eric
pulled
an
eloquent
face
it
the
nastiest
stuff
but
i
promised
titania
i
take
it
i
sometimes
have
a
chocolate
after
it
will
you
have
one
now
we
just
going
to
unpack
our
basket
to
get
tea
will
it
hurt
you
if
we
wheel
you
over
there
on
to
the
grass
there
such
a
lovely
place
where
we
could
sit
the
spot
that
the
girls
had
chosen
for
their
picnic
was
ideal
it
was
a
patch
of
short
fine
grass
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
a
bank
for
a
seat
the
ground
was
blue
with
the
beautiful
little
flowers
of
the
vernal
squill
and
clumps
of
white
bladder
campion
and
golden
lady
fingers
bloomed
in
such
profusion
that
the
place
was
like
a
wild
garden
the
air
was
soft
and
warm
for
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
afternoons
in
early
may
when
nature
seems
predominant
and
one
can
almost
spy
nymphs
among
the
trees
below
them
the
sea
rippled
calm
and
shining
merging
at
the
horizon
into
the
tender
blue
of
the
sky
gulls
and
puffins
wheeled
and
screamed
over
the
rocks
eric
looked
round
with
a
expression
on
his
quaint
little
face
and
gravely
accepted
the
flowers
that
dona
picked
for
him
it
enchanted
ground
he
said
in
his
oldfashioned
way
every
flower
hides
the
heart
of
a
tiny
fairy
i
know
because
i
been
here
in
my
dreams
i
have
funny
dreams
sometimes
they
more
real
than
being
awake
one
night
i
was
floating
in
the
air
just
like
that
bird
over
the
sea
i
lay
on
my
back
and
i
could
see
the
blue
sky
above
me
and
look
down
at
the
green
cliffs
far
below
i
was
frightened
because
i
knew
i
could
fall
i
felt
quite
strong
and
well
and
my
leg
did
hurt
me
at
all
sometimes
i
dream
i
can
go
through
the
air
it
is
exactly
either
flying
or
floating
or
running
it
more
like
shooting
i
get
to
the
tops
of
mountains
and
see
the
wonderfullest
places
and
another
night
i
was
riding
on
the
waves
there
was
a
great
storm
and
i
came
sweeping
in
with
the
tide
into
the
bay
i
wish
i
could
always
dream
like
that
you
shall
have
tea
with
the
elves
said
elaine
bringing
the
little
fellow
back
if
not
to
absolute
reality
at
least
to
a
less
visionary
world
than
the
he
was
picturing
look
brought
a
mug
with
a
robin
on
it
for
your
milk
may
you
eat
bread
and
honey
honey
is
fairy
food
you
know
here
a
paper
serviette
with
violets
round
it
instead
of
a
plate
eric
appetite
was
apparently
that
of
a
sparrow
he
ate
a
very
little
of
the
bread
and
honey
and
a
tiny
piece
of
cake
but
drank
the
milk
feverishly
he
seemed
tired
and
lay
back
for
a
while
on
his
pillows
without
speaking
just
gazing
at
the
flowers
and
the
sea
and
the
sky
he
fondled
his
book
now
and
then
with
a
long
sigh
of
content
elaine
motioned
to
marjorie
and
dona
not
to
disturb
him
her
knowledge
of
nursing
told
her
that
the
child
must
not
be
or
wearied
she
felt
it
a
responsibility
to
have
charge
of
him
and
was
rather
relieved
when
lizzie
creaking
boots
came
back
along
the
road
eric
brightened
up
to
say
i
shall
tell
titania
all
about
you
he
vouchsafed
perhaps
come
and
see
me
soon
now
i
love
her
best
of
course
but
i
love
you
next
best
i
shall
pretend
every
day
that
i
playing
with
you
here
i
hope
he
not
too
tired
whispered
elaine
to
lizzie
no
but
i
best
get
him
home
now
or
his
ma
be
anxious
he
one
of
his
attacks
last
night
oh
it
have
done
him
good
coming
out
this
afternoon
he
was
set
on
seeing
you
the
girls
stood
watching
as
lizzie
trundled
the
long
perambulator
away
then
packed
their
basket
and
set
off
towards
brackenfield
for
it
was
time
for
marjorie
and
dona
to
return
to
school
how
stupid
of
us
ejaculated
elaine
we
never
asked
his
surname
or
where
he
lives
and
i
particularly
intended
to
this
time
so
did
i
but
i
quite
forgot
echoed
marjorie
i
not
sure
if
i
want
to
know
said
dona
he
just
eric
to
me
like
someone
out
of
a
book
i
never
met
such
a
sweet
dear
precious
thing
in
all
my
life
before
of
course
if
i
do
know
his
name
i
ca
send
him
things
but
i
got
an
idea
we
leave
a
little
parcel
for
him
with
the
girl
who
looks
after
the
refreshment
kiosk
on
the
whitecliffe
road
and
ask
her
to
give
it
to
him
next
time
he
passes
she
mistake
the
long
perambulator
and
write
the
fairies
on
it
good
agreed
marjorie
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
eric
will
like
chapter
xix
a
potato
walk
dona
suggestion
was
adopted
and
she
and
marjorie
began
a
little
system
of
correspondence
with
eric
at
their
request
elaine
bought
a
small
present
and
left
the
parcel
with
the
attendant
at
the
refreshment
kiosk
who
promised
to
give
it
to
him
i
know
the
child
quite
well
by
sight
she
said
a
delicate
little
fellow
in
an
invalid
carriage
they
used
to
pass
here
two
or
three
times
a
week
last
summer
and
sometimes
they
stop
at
the
kiosk
and
the
girl
would
buy
him
an
orange
or
some
sweets
i
had
seen
him
for
months
till
he
went
by
a
few
days
ago
yes
i
be
sure
to
stop
him
when
he
passes
that
the
girl
kept
her
word
was
evident
for
a
week
afterwards
she
handed
elaine
a
letter
addressed
to
the
fairy
ladies
elaine
forwarded
it
to
marjorie
and
dona
it
was
written
in
a
round
childish
hand
and
ran
darling
bluebell
and
silverstar
i
like
the
puzzle
you
sent
me
i
often
think
about
you
i
love
you
very
much
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
again
i
played
fairies
all
yesterday
and
pretended
you
were
here
with
love
from
eric
dear
little
man
said
marjorie
i
expect
it
taken
him
a
long
time
to
write
this
we
buy
him
a
blotter
and
some
fancy
paper
and
envelopes
and
leave
them
at
the
kiosk
for
him
i
wish
we
could
go
to
the
cove
and
see
him
again
said
dona
it
happened
that
for
the
next
two
exeats
aunt
ellinor
had
arranged
a
tennis
party
or
some
other
engagement
for
her
nieces
so
that
it
was
not
possible
to
take
a
walk
on
the
cliffs
they
left
a
supply
of
little
presents
however
at
the
kiosk
so
that
something
could
be
given
to
eric
every
time
he
passed
the
assistant
was
almost
as
interested
as
marjorie
and
dona
he
looks
out
for
those
parcels
now
she
assured
them
you
should
just
see
his
face
when
i
run
out
and
give
them
to
him
i
believe
he
be
ever
so
disappointed
if
there
was
nothing
the
girl
that
wheels
him
left
a
message
for
you
his
mother
thanks
you
for
your
kindness
and
will
you
please
excuse
his
writing
because
it
is
very
good
for
him
and
takes
him
such
a
long
time
he
never
been
able
to
go
to
school
poor
little
chap
laughed
dona
i
expect
someone
has
to
sit
by
him
and
tell
him
how
to
spell
every
word
never
mind
he
can
draw
fairies
on
the
notepaper
we
sent
him
we
get
him
a
chalk
pencil
i
dare
say
he
like
a
album
and
some
cards
to
put
in
it
suggested
marjorie
oh
yes
i
saw
some
of
flower
fairies
at
the
stores
we
ask
elaine
to
get
them
and
those
funny
ones
of
cats
and
dogs
i
no
doubt
it
anything
to
amuse
him
when
he
has
to
lie
still
all
the
day
long
as
the
summer
wore
on
and
submarines
sank
many
of
our
merchant
vessels
on
the
seas
the
food
question
began
to
be
an
important
problem
at
brackenfield
everyone
was
intensely
patriotic
and
ready
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
help
on
the
war
morrison
believed
in
keeping
the
girls
well
abreast
of
the
important
topics
of
the
moment
she
considered
the
oldfashioned
schools
of
fifty
years
ago
where
the
pupils
never
saw
a
newspaper
and
were
utterly
out
of
touch
with
the
world
did
not
conduce
to
the
making
of
good
citizens
she
liked
her
girls
to
think
out
questions
for
themselves
she
had
several
enthusiastic
spirits
among
the
prefects
and
found
that
by
giving
them
a
few
general
hints
to
work
upon
she
could
trust
them
to
lead
the
others
winifrede
in
particular
realized
the
gravity
of
the
situation
armed
with
a
supply
of
leaflets
from
the
local
food
control
bureau
she
convened
a
meeting
of
the
entire
school
in
the
assembly
hall
winifrede
was
a
girl
whose
intense
love
of
her
country
and
ready
power
of
fluent
speech
would
probably
lead
her
some
day
to
a
public
platform
meantime
she
could
always
sway
a
brackenfield
audience
she
was
dramatic
in
her
methods
and
when
the
girls
entered
the
hall
they
were
greeted
by
large
posters
announcing
the
germans
are
trying
to
starve
us
german
submarines
are
reducing
supplies
you
must
economize
at
home
there
were
no
teachers
present
on
this
occasion
and
the
platform
was
occupied
by
the
prefects
winifrede
with
an
eager
face
and
fully
convinced
of
the
burning
necessity
of
rationing
stood
up
and
began
her
speech
girls
i
think
i
need
tell
you
that
we
fighting
in
the
most
terrible
war
the
world
has
ever
seen
we
matched
against
a
foe
whose
force
and
cunning
will
need
every
atom
of
strength
of
which
capable
they
are
not
only
shooting
our
soldiers
at
the
front
and
bombing
our
towns
but
by
their
submarine
warfare
they
are
deliberately
trying
to
reduce
us
by
starvation
there
is
already
a
food
crisis
in
our
country
there
is
a
serious
shortage
of
wheat
of
potatoes
of
sugar
and
of
other
perhaps
you
think
that
so
long
as
you
have
money
you
will
be
able
to
buy
food
that
is
not
so
as
long
as
there
is
plenty
of
food
money
is
a
convenience
to
buy
it
with
but
no
more
money
is
not
value
if
the
food
is
not
there
money
will
not
make
it
and
money
becomes
useless
food
gives
money
its
value
we
can
do
without
money
but
we
can
not
do
without
food
people
see
the
bakers
shops
full
of
bread
the
butchers
shops
full
of
meat
the
grocers
shops
full
of
provisions
and
they
believe
there
is
plenty
of
food
this
is
merely
food
on
the
surface
the
stock
of
food
from
which
the
shops
draw
the
food
is
low
seriously
low
already
unless
we
ration
ourselves
at
once
and
carefully
there
will
come
days
when
there
may
be
no
bread
at
all
at
the
baker
there
is
a
shortage
of
wheat
all
over
the
world
not
only
in
europe
but
also
in
north
and
south
america
millions
of
the
men
who
grew
the
wheat
we
eat
are
fighting
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
will
never
go
back
to
the
fields
they
ploughed
if
the
present
waste
of
bread
and
wheat
flour
continues
there
will
be
hardly
enough
to
go
round
till
next
harvest
time
great
britain
only
produces
of
the
bread
it
eats
of
the
wheat
comes
from
abroad
hundreds
of
the
ships
that
brought
it
are
now
engaged
in
other
work
they
are
carrying
food
and
munitions
to
france
italy
and
russia
the
ships
that
brought
us
food
are
fewer
by
those
hundreds
it
is
the
women
of
the
country
who
must
see
to
this
by
careful
rationing
we
can
make
our
supplies
hold
out
until
after
the
harvest
our
men
are
out
at
the
front
fighting
a
grim
battle
but
unless
we
do
our
part
of
the
business
at
home
they
may
fight
a
losing
battle
it
is
for
us
to
see
that
our
noble
dead
have
not
died
in
vain
with
martyred
belgium
for
an
object
lesson
it
is
the
duty
of
every
british
girl
to
make
every
possible
sacrifice
to
keep
those
unspeakable
huns
out
of
our
islands
i
appeal
to
you
all
to
use
the
utmost
economy
and
abstinence
and
voluntarily
to
give
up
some
of
the
things
that
you
like
remember
you
will
be
helping
to
win
the
war
there
is
a
rationing
pledge
on
the
table
near
the
door
and
i
ask
every
girl
to
sign
it
and
to
wear
the
violet
ribbon
that
will
be
given
her
it
is
the
badge
of
the
new
temperance
cause
the
freedom
of
the
world
depends
at
the
present
time
on
the
food
thrift
and
of
our
civilians
no
less
than
on
the
courage
of
our
soldiers
please
take
some
of
the
leaflets
which
you
will
find
on
the
table
and
read
them
they
have
been
sent
here
for
us
by
the
food
control
bureau
after
winifrede
speech
every
girl
felt
in
honour
bound
to
comply
with
her
request
and
turn
by
turn
they
signed
their
pledges
and
sported
their
violet
ribbons
it
mean
knocking
off
buns
i
suppose
sighed
sylvia
mournfully
certainly
a
bun
and
do
the
hun
improvised
marjorie
look
here
said
betty
studying
a
pamphlet
it
says
a
man
is
working
hard
he
needs
a
great
deal
more
food
than
when
he
is
resting
there
are
no
exceptions
to
this
rule
it
follows
that
workers
save
energy
by
resting
as
much
as
they
can
in
their
spare
time
if
true
the
less
work
we
do
the
smaller
our
appetites
will
be
i
vote
we
petition
the
empress
in
the
interests
of
patriotism
to
shorten
our
by
half
she
probably
suggest
knocking
off
cricket
and
tennis
instead
my
betty
well
at
any
rate
it
says
people
need
more
food
than
small
and
i
taller
than
you
so
i
ought
to
have
half
of
your
dinner
bread
old
sport
ah
but
look
it
also
says
who
are
well
covered
need
much
less
food
than
thin
people
so
i
score
there
and
ought
to
have
half
of
your
dinner
bread
instead
we
each
stick
to
our
own
allowances
thanks
morrison
who
was
on
the
committee
of
the
whitecliffe
food
control
campaign
was
glad
to
have
secured
the
of
her
girls
in
the
alterations
which
she
was
now
obliged
to
make
in
their
dietary
on
the
whole
they
rather
liked
some
of
the
substitutes
for
wheat
flour
and
quite
enjoyed
the
bread
and
the
oatcakes
and
biscuits
that
figured
on
the
tables
at
they
dry
but
you
feel
so
patriotic
when
you
eat
them
declared
marjorie
i
believe
you
chump
sawdust
buns
if
you
thought
you
were
helping
on
the
war
laughed
chrissie
i
would
with
pleasure
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
potatoes
ran
short
so
far
brackenfield
had
not
suffered
in
that
respect
but
now
the
supply
from
the
large
kitchen
garden
had
given
out
and
the
whitecliffe
greengrocers
were
quite
unable
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
school
for
a
fortnight
the
girls
ate
swedes
instead
and
tried
to
like
them
then
morrison
received
a
message
from
a
farmer
that
he
had
plenty
of
potatoes
in
his
fields
but
lacked
the
labour
to
cart
them
he
would
however
be
prepared
to
dispose
of
a
certain
quantity
on
condition
that
they
could
be
fetched
here
was
news
indeed
the
potatoes
were
there
and
only
needed
to
be
carried
away
the
principal
at
once
organized
parties
of
girls
to
go
with
baskets
to
the
farm
instead
of
sending
seniors
intermediates
and
juniors
separately
morrison
ordered
representatives
from
the
three
hostels
to
form
each
detachment
she
considered
that
lately
the
elder
girls
had
been
keeping
too
much
aloof
from
the
younger
ones
and
that
the
spirit
of
unity
in
the
school
might
suffer
in
consequence
the
expedition
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
meeting
together
and
she
gave
a
hint
to
the
prefects
that
she
had
noticed
and
deprecated
their
tendency
to
exclusiveness
as
a
direct
result
of
her
suggestions
marjorie
one
afternoon
found
herself
walking
to
the
farm
in
the
select
company
of
winifrede
mason
it
was
such
an
overwhelming
honour
to
be
thus
favoured
by
the
head
girl
that
marjorie
powers
of
conversation
were
at
first
rather
damped
and
she
replied
in
monosyllables
to
winifrede
remarks
but
the
latter
who
was
determined
as
she
had
informed
her
fellow
prefects
to
do
her
duty
by
those
intermediates
persevered
in
her
attempts
to
be
pleasant
till
marjorie
who
was
naturally
talkative
thawed
at
length
and
found
her
tongue
there
was
no
doubt
that
winifrede
when
she
stepped
down
from
her
pedestal
was
a
most
winning
companion
she
had
a
charming
humorous
racy
whimsical
way
of
commenting
on
things
and
a
whole
fund
of
amusing
stories
marjorie
astonished
and
fascinated
responded
eagerly
to
her
advances
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
farm
had
formed
quite
a
different
estimation
of
the
head
girl
the
walk
in
itself
was
delightful
their
way
lay
along
a
road
that
led
over
the
moors
on
either
side
stretched
an
expanse
of
gorse
and
whinberry
bushes
interspersed
with
patches
of
grass
where
sheep
were
feeding
dykes
filled
with
water
edged
the
road
and
in
these
were
growing
rushes
and
sedges
and
crowfoot
and
a
few
and
other
flowers
larks
were
singing
gloriously
overhead
and
the
plovers
flitted
about
with
their
plaintive
sometimes
a
stonechat
or
a
wheatear
would
pause
for
a
moment
on
a
gorse
stump
flirting
its
brown
tail
before
it
flew
out
of
sight
or
young
rabbits
would
peep
from
the
whinberry
bushes
and
whisk
away
into
cover
far
off
in
the
distance
lay
the
hazy
outline
of
the
sea
there
was
a
great
sense
of
space
and
openness
the
fresh
pure
air
blew
down
from
the
hills
cooler
and
more
invigorating
even
than
the
sea
breeze
except
for
the
sheep
and
an
occasional
collie
dog
and
shepherd
they
had
the
world
to
themselves
winifrede
took
long
sighing
breaths
of
air
her
eyes
were
shining
with
enjoyment
i
like
the
quiet
of
it
all
she
told
marjorie
i
can
understand
the
feeling
that
made
the
mediæval
hermits
build
their
lonely
little
cells
in
peaceful
beautiful
spots
some
of
the
hindoos
do
the
same
and
go
and
live
in
the
forests
to
have
time
to
meditate
when
getting
old
i
like
to
come
and
take
a
cottage
on
this
moor
not
before
i
think
because
there
so
very
much
i
want
to
do
in
the
world
first
but
when
i
feel
i
growing
past
my
work
then
will
be
the
time
to
arrange
my
thoughts
and
slip
into
the
spirit
of
the
peace
up
here
what
kind
of
work
do
you
want
to
do
asked
marjorie
i
not
sure
yet
i
leaving
school
of
course
at
the
end
of
this
term
and
i
ca
quite
decide
whether
to
go
on
to
college
or
to
begin
something
to
help
the
war
morrison
advises
college
she
says
i
could
be
far
more
help
afterwards
if
i
were
properly
qualified
and
i
dare
say
she
right
only
i
do
want
to
wait
i
just
yearning
to
leave
school
and
be
a
or
drive
an
ambulance
wagon
sympathized
marjorie
my
sister
is
out
in
france
at
canteen
work
confided
winifrede
it
makes
me
fearfully
envious
when
i
have
her
letters
and
think
what
doing
for
the
tommies
i
three
brothers
at
the
front
and
five
cousins
and
two
more
cousins
were
killed
a
year
ago
my
eldest
brother
has
been
wounded
twice
and
the
youngest
is
in
hospital
now
i
simply
live
for
news
of
them
all
the
girls
had
now
reached
the
farm
a
little
whitewashed
house
almost
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
though
the
principal
occupation
of
its
owner
lay
among
sheep
he
had
a
clearing
of
fields
where
he
grew
swedes
potatoes
and
a
little
barley
in
a
sheltered
place
behind
his
he
had
a
stock
of
last
year
potatoes
still
left
they
were
piled
into
a
long
heap
covered
with
straw
and
then
with
earth
as
a
protection
he
took
the
girls
round
here
measured
the
potatoes
in
a
bushel
bin
and
then
filled
the
baskets
they
wo
keep
much
longer
he
informed
miss
norton
i
have
carted
them
down
to
whitecliffe
only
i
no
horse
now
and
it
difficult
to
borrow
one
and
i
ca
spare
the
time
from
the
sheep
either
so
scarce
now
my
two
sons
are
fighting
and
i
only
a
grandson
of
fourteen
and
a
daughter
to
help
me
everybody
is
feeling
the
same
pinch
replied
miss
norton
we
only
too
glad
to
come
and
fetch
the
potatoes
ourselves
it
a
nice
walk
for
us
the
girls
who
overheard
the
conversation
felt
they
cordially
agreed
it
was
fun
wandering
round
the
little
looking
at
the
ducks
and
chickens
and
calves
or
peeping
inside
the
barns
and
stables
several
of
them
began
to
register
vows
to
work
on
the
land
when
were
over
they
got
a
new
german
camp
over
there
volunteered
the
farmer
i
suppose
their
first
contingent
of
prisoners
arrived
yesterday
you
heard
about
it
oh
they
been
busy
for
weeks
putting
up
barbed
wire
it
ca
be
so
far
from
your
place
either
you
pass
it
if
you
crossed
the
stile
there
and
went
back
over
the
moor
instead
of
round
by
the
road
at
the
news
of
a
german
camp
a
kind
of
electric
thrill
passed
round
the
company
the
girls
were
wild
with
curiosity
to
see
it
and
pressed
miss
norton
to
allow
them
to
return
to
brackenfield
by
the
moorland
path
the
mistress
herself
seemed
interested
and
consented
quite
readily
it
was
a
much
quicker
way
back
to
the
school
and
would
save
time
she
was
grateful
to
briggs
for
having
pointed
out
so
short
a
cut
the
camp
lay
on
the
side
of
a
hill
about
between
the
farm
and
brackenfield
near
enough
to
distinguish
the
latter
building
quite
plainly
in
the
distance
it
was
surrounded
by
an
entanglement
of
barbed
wire
and
there
were
sentries
on
duty
within
the
circle
of
wire
were
tents
and
the
girls
could
see
washing
hanging
out
and
a
few
figures
lying
on
the
ground
and
apparently
smoking
they
would
have
liked
to
linger
and
look
but
miss
norton
marched
them
briskly
past
and
discipline
forbade
an
undue
exhibition
of
curiosity
they
had
gone
perhaps
only
a
few
hundred
yards
when
they
heard
the
regular
of
footsteps
and
up
from
the
dell
below
came
a
further
batch
of
prisoners
under
an
escort
of
soldiers
miss
norton
hastily
marshalled
her
flock
and
made
them
stand
aside
to
allow
the
contingent
room
to
pass
they
were
a
tall
set
of
men
stouter
and
apparently
better
fed
than
their
guards
they
had
no
appearance
of
hard
usage
or
ill
treatment
and
were
marching
quite
cheerily
towards
the
camp
probably
anticipating
a
meal
the
girls
drawn
up
in
double
line
thrilled
with
excitement
as
they
passed
if
one
tried
to
run
away
would
they
shoot
him
asked
betty
in
an
awed
voice
yes
the
guards
have
their
rifles
all
ready
replied
marjorie
if
one
tried
to
escape
he
have
a
bullet
through
his
back
in
a
second
and
quite
right
too
what
the
matter
chrissie
nothing
only
it
makes
me
feel
queer
i
feel
queer
when
i
remember
how
many
of
our
own
men
are
prisoners
in
germany
declared
winifrede
quietly
girls
and
do
stare
said
miss
norton
we
ought
to
pity
these
poor
men
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
a
prisoner
of
war
i
do
pity
them
grumbled
marjorie
fiercely
under
her
breath
perhaps
they
the
very
ones
who
been
fighting
leonard
regiment
yes
when
one
thinks
of
one
brothers
it
does
make
one
love
the
germans
whispered
winifrede
love
them
flared
marjorie
i
would
consciously
speak
to
a
german
for
ten
thousand
pounds
and
if
i
happened
by
mistake
to
shake
hands
with
one
well
i
have
to
go
and
disinfect
my
hand
afterwards
miss
norton
welcome
to
them
if
she
pities
them
said
betty
from
behind
go
on
girls
now
came
the
teacher
voice
as
the
contingent
tramped
away
into
the
camp
i
disgusted
with
miss
norton
groused
marjorie
come
along
chrissie
what
the
matter
with
you
old
sport
anybody
think
seen
a
ghost
instead
of
a
batch
of
germans
why
you
gone
quite
pale
i
only
tired
snapped
chrissie
rather
crossly
you
always
making
remarks
about
something
i
going
to
walk
with
patricia
oh
all
right
just
as
you
please
i
do
press
myself
on
anybody
i
walk
with
winifrede
again
if
she
have
me
chapter
xx
patriotic
gardening
the
direct
result
of
the
potato
walk
to
briggs
farm
was
that
a
friendship
sprang
up
between
winifrede
and
marjorie
it
was
of
course
rather
an
exceptional
friendship
involving
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
head
girl
and
frantic
devotion
on
marjorie
part
six
months
ago
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
winifrede
creed
of
exclusiveness
had
discouraged
any
familiarity
with
her
juniors
and
it
was
only
in
accordance
with
morrison
wishes
that
she
had
broken
her
barrier
of
reserve
she
had
however
taken
rather
a
fancy
to
marjorie
and
sometimes
invited
her
into
her
study
to
go
and
sit
in
winifrede
tiny
sanctum
to
see
her
books
photographs
post
cards
and
other
treasures
and
to
be
regaled
with
cocoa
and
biscuits
was
a
privilege
that
raised
marjorie
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
bliss
her
impulsive
disposition
made
her
apt
to
take
up
hot
friendships
and
for
the
present
she
worshipped
winifrede
to
be
singled
out
for
favour
by
the
head
girl
was
in
itself
a
distinction
but
apart
from
that
marjorie
keenly
appreciated
her
society
she
would
wait
about
to
do
any
little
errand
for
her
would
wash
her
brushes
after
the
lesson
sharpen
her
pencils
set
butterflies
for
her
mount
pressed
flowers
or
print
out
photographs
winifrede
was
fond
of
entomology
and
marjorie
beforetime
a
lukewarm
naturalist
now
waxed
enthusiastic
in
the
collection
of
specimens
she
was
running
one
day
in
pursuit
of
a
gorgeous
through
the
little
wood
that
skirted
the
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
elusive
quarry
she
almost
tumbled
over
chrissie
who
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
stream
hallo
said
marjorie
drawing
herself
up
suddenly
i
did
see
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
looking
where
i
was
going
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
chrissie
marjorie
pointed
to
her
what
are
you
doing
here
she
returned
reading
chrissie
eyes
were
red
and
she
blinked
rapidly
you
been
crying
said
marjorie
tactlessly
her
chum
flushed
crimson
i
not
i
wish
you
just
let
me
alone
cheer
oh
do
get
raggy
old
sport
chrissie
turned
away
and
opening
her
book
began
to
read
will
you
come
round
the
field
with
me
asked
marjorie
no
thanks
i
rather
stay
where
i
am
oh
very
well
i
off
this
was
not
the
first
little
tiff
that
had
taken
place
between
the
two
girls
chrissie
seemed
to
have
changed
lately
she
was
moody
and
and
ready
to
fire
up
on
very
slight
provocation
her
devotion
to
marjorie
seemed
to
have
somewhat
waned
she
scarcely
ever
made
her
presents
now
or
wrote
her
notes
she
was
chatty
enough
in
the
dormitory
but
saw
little
of
her
in
recreation
hours
marjorie
set
this
down
to
jealousy
of
her
friendship
with
winifrede
in
her
absorption
in
her
head
girl
she
had
certainly
not
given
chrissie
so
much
of
her
time
as
formerly
she
walked
along
the
field
now
rather
soberly
she
disliked
quarrelling
but
her
own
temper
was
hot
as
well
as
her
chum
i
ca
help
it
she
groused
chrissie
always
taking
offence
everything
i
do
seems
to
rub
her
the
wrong
way
she
need
think
going
to
give
up
winifrede
i
wish
she
be
more
sensible
well
i
care
i
shall
just
take
no
notice
and
leave
her
to
herself
and
then
she
probably
come
round
marjorie
surmises
proved
correct
for
chrissie
placed
a
dainty
little
bottle
of
scent
and
an
enthusiastic
note
on
her
that
evening
the
clouds
blew
over
and
for
a
time
at
any
rate
matters
were
quite
pleasant
again
constant
little
quarrels
however
wear
holes
in
a
friendship
and
it
was
evident
to
elgiva
that
some
cleavage
had
taken
place
chrissie
and
marjorie
seem
a
little
off
with
the
david
and
jonathan
business
commented
francie
too
hot
to
last
i
fancy
returned
patricia
marjorie
got
a
new
idol
now
one
reason
for
the
separation
between
the
two
girls
was
that
while
chrissie
cared
chiefly
for
tennis
marjorie
was
a
devotee
of
cricket
and
was
spending
most
of
her
spare
time
under
the
coaching
of
stella
pearson
the
games
captain
she
showed
much
promise
in
bowling
and
was
not
without
hopes
of
being
put
into
her
house
eleven
to
play
for
elgiva
was
an
honour
worth
working
for
it
would
be
a
great
triumph
to
be
able
to
write
the
news
to
her
brothers
dona
had
not
taken
violently
either
to
cricket
or
tennis
and
beyond
the
compulsory
practice
never
touched
bat
or
ball
giving
herself
up
entirely
to
natural
history
study
and
photography
she
was
not
so
energetic
as
her
sister
and
did
not
much
care
for
running
about
at
half
term
however
a
new
interest
claimed
her
the
head
gardener
was
taken
ill
and
sister
johnstone
assumed
the
responsibility
for
his
work
she
asked
for
helpers
and
a
number
of
girls
volunteered
their
services
and
occupied
themselves
busily
about
the
grounds
they
rolled
and
marked
the
earthed
up
potatoes
put
sticks
for
the
peas
planted
out
cabbages
and
weeded
the
drive
it
was
the
kind
of
work
that
appealed
to
dona
and
her
satisfaction
was
complete
when
morrison
excused
her
cricket
practices
for
the
purpose
i
like
gardening
much
better
than
games
she
confided
to
marjorie
there
more
to
show
for
it
what
have
you
got
at
the
end
of
a
whole
term
cricket
i
should
like
to
know
honour
my
child
said
marjorie
well
i
shall
have
six
rows
of
cauliflowers
and
that
more
to
the
point
especially
in
these
hard
times
twinkled
dona
i
consider
i
who
am
the
patriotic
one
now
you
not
helping
the
war
by
bowling
with
stella
and
every
cauliflower
of
mine
will
go
to
feed
a
soldier
i
thought
the
school
was
to
eat
them
they
wo
be
ready
till
the
holidays
so
sister
johnstone
says
have
to
be
sent
to
the
red
cross
hospital
we
going
to
gather
the
first
crop
of
peas
though
you
eat
them
at
dinner
two
of
the
prefects
meg
hutchinson
and
gladys
butler
had
joined
the
band
of
gardeners
and
carried
on
operations
with
enthusiasm
i
mean
to
go
on
the
land
as
soon
as
i
leave
school
declared
meg
my
sister
molly
working
at
a
farm
in
herefordshire
she
gets
up
at
six
every
morning
to
feed
the
pigs
and
cows
breakfast
is
at
eight
and
then
she
goes
round
to
look
after
the
cattle
in
the
fields
dinner
is
at
twelve
and
after
that
she
cleans
harness
or
takes
the
horses
to
be
shod
and
feeds
the
pigs
and
calves
again
she
loves
it
and
she
won
her
green
armlet
from
the
government
my
cousin
working
at
a
market
garden
said
gladys
she
bicycles
over
every
morning
from
home
it
three
miles
away
so
she
has
to
start
ever
so
early
she
got
to
know
all
about
managing
the
tomato
houses
now
once
she
a
very
funny
experience
they
sent
her
out
for
a
day
to
tidy
somebody
garden
she
took
a
little
can
full
of
coffee
with
her
and
some
lunch
in
a
basket
an
old
gentleman
and
lady
came
out
to
superintend
the
gardening
and
they
seemed
most
staggered
to
find
that
she
was
a
lady
and
could
understand
it
at
all
but
they
were
very
kind
and
sent
her
some
tea
into
the
greenhouse
evidently
they
had
debated
whether
to
invite
her
into
the
or
not
but
had
turned
tail
at
the
thought
of
her
thick
boots
on
the
best
carpet
nellie
was
so
amused
she
said
she
felt
far
too
dirty
after
digging
up
borders
to
go
indoors
and
was
most
relieved
that
they
did
invite
her
she
had
a
tray
full
of
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
greenhouse
cakes
and
jam
and
potted
meat
the
old
lady
asked
her
ever
so
many
questions
and
it
turned
out
that
they
knew
some
mutual
friends
was
it
funny
morrison
was
very
pleased
with
the
results
of
the
girls
work
in
the
garden
she
declared
that
the
had
never
looked
better
and
that
the
crop
of
vegetables
was
unusually
fine
i
ca
give
you
armlets
she
said
though
you
thoroughly
deserve
them
i
should
like
to
have
your
photos
taken
in
a
group
to
keep
as
a
remembrance
i
shall
call
you
my
to
the
land
girls
at
brackenfield
any
wish
expressed
by
the
empress
was
carried
out
if
possible
so
muriel
adams
who
possessed
the
best
and
biggest
camera
was
requisitioned
to
take
the
gardeners
they
grouped
themselves
picturesquely
round
a
wheelbarrow
some
holding
spades
rakes
or
and
others
displaying
their
best
specimens
of
carrots
or
cabbages
sister
johnstone
in
the
middle
smiled
benignly
the
plate
was
duly
developed
and
a
good
print
taken
and
handed
round
for
inspection
each
girl
of
course
declared
that
her
own
portrait
was
atrocious
but
those
of
the
others
excellent
and
it
was
unanimously
decided
to
have
a
copy
framed
for
presentation
to
morrison
there
was
one
advantage
in
belonging
to
the
back
to
the
land
girls
they
might
visit
the
kitchen
garden
at
any
time
they
wished
it
was
forbidden
ground
to
the
rest
of
the
school
so
it
was
rather
nice
to
be
able
to
wander
at
will
between
the
long
lines
of
gooseberry
bushes
or
rows
of
peas
dona
loved
the
fresh
smell
of
it
all
especially
after
rain
she
spent
every
available
moment
there
for
it
was
an
excellent
place
for
pursuing
natural
history
study
she
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
birds
or
of
catching
moths
and
butterflies
and
generally
had
a
net
handy
with
a
magnifying
glass
she
often
watched
the
movements
of
small
insects
she
had
come
in
one
afternoon
for
this
purpose
and
wandered
down
to
a
rather
wild
spot
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
it
was
a
small
piece
of
rough
ground
surrounded
by
a
high
hedge
on
the
farther
side
of
which
the
land
sloped
in
a
sharp
decline
as
dona
hunted
about
among
the
docks
for
caterpillars
or
other
specimens
greatly
to
her
surprise
she
saw
a
figure
come
pushing
through
the
hedge
it
wore
a
gym
costume
and
a
elgiva
hat
and
as
the
leaves
parted
they
revealed
the
face
of
chrissie
lang
her
astonishment
was
evidently
equal
to
dona
for
a
moment
she
flushed
crimson
then
turned
the
matter
off
airily
i
often
thought
i
should
like
to
see
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
that
hedge
she
remarked
you
get
a
nice
view
across
the
country
you
lose
three
conduct
marks
if
you
caught
in
the
kitchen
garden
remarked
dona
drily
she
was
not
remarkably
fond
of
chrissie
and
did
not
see
why
anyone
else
should
enjoy
the
privileges
accorded
to
those
who
were
working
in
the
garden
meg
hutchinson
weeding
cabbages
up
by
the
cucumber
frames
she
added
thanks
for
telling
me
i
go
out
the
other
way
i
no
particular
wish
to
be
pounced
upon
what
that
in
your
hand
asked
dona
a
i
declare
well
chrissie
lang
of
all
conceited
people
you
really
are
the
limit
did
you
bring
it
out
to
admire
your
beauty
i
want
to
try
a
new
way
of
doing
my
hair
and
there
no
peace
in
the
dormitory
ca
you
draw
the
curtains
of
your
cubicle
they
peep
round
and
laugh
at
me
well
anyone
would
laugh
at
you
more
for
bringing
out
a
into
the
garden
i
think
you
the
silliest
idiot
i
ever
met
thanks
for
the
compliment
chrissie
strolled
away
whistling
jauntily
to
herself
and
picking
a
gooseberry
or
two
from
the
bushes
as
she
passed
dona
frowned
as
she
watched
her
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
the
back
to
the
land
girls
never
to
touch
any
of
the
fruit
by
a
heroic
effort
she
refrained
from
running
after
chrissie
and
giving
a
further
unvarnished
opinion
of
her
instead
however
she
walked
back
up
the
other
path
she
found
meg
hutchinson
and
gladys
butler
sitting
on
the
cucumber
frame
it
was
in
a
high
part
of
the
garden
and
commanded
a
good
view
over
the
country
gladys
had
a
pair
of
and
with
their
aid
could
plainly
make
out
the
german
camp
on
the
hill
opposite
she
was
quite
excited
i
can
see
the
barbed
wire
she
declared
and
the
tents
and
i
believe
i
can
make
out
some
things
that
look
like
figures
the
focus
of
these
glasses
is
very
good
i
wish
we
had
a
telescope
if
they
i
expect
they
can
see
the
school
said
meg
oh
but
they
would
let
them
have
any
you
may
be
sure
are
they
kept
very
strictly
asked
dona
of
course
they
under
military
discipline
explained
meg
would
you
like
to
take
a
peep
said
gladys
offering
the
glasses
you
must
screw
this
part
round
till
it
focuses
right
for
your
eyes
can
you
see
now
yes
beautifully
what
are
they
doing
just
lounging
about
i
expect
i
believe
they
have
to
do
a
certain
amount
of
camp
work
keep
their
tents
tidy
and
clean
the
pans
and
peel
potatoes
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
they
may
play
games
it
a
pity
we
ca
set
them
to
work
on
the
land
said
meg
they
do
in
some
places
i
afraid
it
could
be
managed
here
so
near
the
sea
it
would
be
far
too
easy
for
them
to
escape
chapter
xxi
the
roll
of
honour
letters
arrived
at
brackenfield
by
an
early
post
they
were
inspected
first
by
the
house
mistresses
and
delivered
immediately
after
breakfast
to
the
girls
who
generally
flew
out
into
the
quadrangle
or
the
grounds
to
devour
them
anderson
made
it
a
rule
to
write
to
marjorie
and
dona
alternately
and
they
would
hand
over
their
news
to
each
other
on
tuesday
morning
marjorie
received
the
usual
letter
in
her
handwriting
but
to
her
surprise
noticed
that
the
postmark
was
london
instead
of
silverwood
with
a
sudden
misgiving
she
tore
it
open
it
contained
bad
tidings
larry
who
had
lately
been
sent
to
the
front
had
been
wounded
in
action
and
was
in
a
military
hospital
in
london
his
mother
had
hurried
up
to
town
to
see
him
and
had
found
him
very
ill
he
was
to
undergo
an
operation
on
the
following
day
i
shall
remain
here
till
the
operation
is
over
wrote
anderson
i
feel
i
must
be
near
him
while
he
is
in
such
a
dangerous
condition
i
will
send
you
another
bulletin
marjorie
went
to
find
dona
and
in
defiance
of
school
etiquette
walked
boldly
into
ethelberta
she
knew
that
on
such
an
occasion
she
would
not
be
reprimanded
miss
jones
who
happened
to
come
into
the
room
comforted
the
two
girls
as
best
she
could
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
she
said
many
of
our
soldiers
go
through
the
most
terrible
operations
and
make
wonderful
recoveries
surgeons
nowadays
are
marvellously
clever
my
own
brother
was
dangerously
wounded
last
autumn
and
is
back
in
the
trenches
now
i
shall
think
of
larry
all
day
sobbed
dona
are
they
ever
out
of
our
thoughts
said
miss
jones
i
believe
we
all
do
the
whole
of
our
work
with
the
trenches
always
in
the
background
of
our
minds
most
of
us
at
brackenfield
simply
live
for
news
from
the
front
there
was
great
feeling
for
marjorie
in
dormitory
no
betty
had
had
a
brother
wounded
earlier
in
the
war
and
sylvia
had
lost
a
cousin
so
they
could
understand
her
anxiety
chrissie
also
offered
sympathy
i
know
how
wretched
you
must
be
she
said
thanks
answered
marjorie
it
certainly
makes
one
jumpy
to
have
relations
in
the
army
is
your
brother
fighting
chrissie
asked
betty
no
replied
chrissie
briefly
but
he
must
surely
be
of
military
age
he
not
very
well
at
present
betty
and
sylvia
looked
at
each
other
there
was
something
mysterious
about
chrissie
brother
she
seldom
alluded
to
him
and
she
had
lately
removed
his
photograph
from
her
the
girls
always
surmised
that
he
must
be
a
conscientious
objector
they
felt
that
it
would
be
a
terrible
disgrace
to
own
a
relative
who
refused
to
defend
his
country
they
were
sorry
for
chrissie
but
it
did
not
make
them
disposed
to
be
any
more
friendly
towards
her
to
marjorie
the
news
about
larry
came
as
a
shock
it
was
the
first
casualty
in
the
family
she
now
realized
the
grim
horror
of
the
war
in
a
way
that
she
had
not
done
before
all
that
day
she
went
about
with
the
sense
of
a
dark
shadow
haunting
her
next
morning
however
the
bulletin
was
better
the
operation
had
been
entirely
successful
and
the
patient
though
weak
was
likely
to
recover
the
doctor
gives
me
very
good
hopes
wrote
anderson
larry
is
having
the
best
of
skilled
nursing
so
we
feel
that
everything
possible
is
being
done
for
him
with
a
great
weight
off
her
mind
marjorie
handed
the
letter
to
dona
and
hurried
off
to
look
for
winifrede
to
tell
her
the
good
news
as
she
was
not
in
the
quadrangle
marjorie
went
into
the
library
on
the
chance
of
finding
her
there
the
room
was
empty
though
miss
duckworth
had
just
been
in
to
put
up
fresh
notices
almost
automatically
marjorie
strolled
up
and
began
to
read
them
a
roll
of
honour
was
kept
at
brackenfield
where
the
names
of
relations
of
past
and
present
girls
were
recorded
it
was
rewritten
every
week
so
as
to
keep
it
up
to
date
she
knew
that
larry
would
be
mentioned
in
this
last
list
thank
god
that
it
was
only
among
the
wounded
the
killed
came
first
adams
captain
staffordshires
fiancé
of
dorothy
craig
hunt
captain
welsh
borderers
brother
of
sophy
hunt
jackson
lieut
lancashires

keary
private
irish
brigade
brother
of
eileen
keary
preston
private
west
yorks
brother
of
kathleen
and
joyce
preston
marjorie
stopped
suddenly
private
preston
the
humorous
young
soldier
whose
acquaintance
she
had
made
in
the
train
and
renewed
in
the
red
cross
hospital
surely
it
could
not
be
he
alas
it
was
only
too
plain
she
knew
he
was
the
brother
of
kathleen
and
joyce
preston
for
he
had
himself
mentioned
that
his
sisters
used
to
be
at
brackenfield
also
he
was
certainly
in
the
west
yorkshire
regiment
this
bright
strong
clever
capable
young
life
sacrificed
marjorie
felt
as
if
she
had
received
a
personal
blow
oh
the
war
was
cruel
cruel
death
was
picking
england
fairest
flowers
indeed
a
certain
chapter
in
her
life
which
had
seemed
to
promise
many
very
sweet
hopes
was
now
for
ever
closed
they
might
have
put
his
on
the
list
she
said
to
herself
i
wish
i
knew
where
he
buried
i
shall
never
forget
him
though
i
only
saw
him
twice
he
was
quite
different
from
anyone
else
i
ever
met
somehow
marjorie
did
not
feel
capable
of
mentioning
private
preston
to
anybody
even
to
dona
she
had
kept
the
little
newspaper
photograph
of
him
which
had
been
cut
out
of
the
when
he
won
his
she
enclosed
it
in
an
envelope
and
put
it
within
the
leaves
of
her
bible
that
seemed
the
most
appropriate
place
for
it
she
could
not
leave
it
amongst
the
portraits
of
her
other
war
heroes
for
fear
her
might
refer
to
it
to
discuss
him
now
with
betty
or
sylvia
would
be
a
desecration
his
death
was
a
wound
that
would
not
bear
handling
for
some
days
afterwards
she
was
unusually
quiet
the
girls
thought
she
was
fretting
about
her
brother
and
tried
to
cheer
her
up
for
bulletins
were
excellent
and
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
wonderful
recovery
he
is
to
leave
the
military
hospital
in
a
fortnight
wrote
anderson
and
be
transferred
to
a
red
cross
hospital
we
are
using
all
our
influence
to
get
him
sent
to
whitecliffe
where
aunt
ellinor
and
elaine
could
specially
look
after
him
to
have
larry
at
whitecliffe
would
indeed
be
a
cause
for
rejoicing
marjorie
could
picture
the
spoiling
he
would
receive
at
the
red
cross
hospital
she
wondered
if
he
would
have
the
same
bed
that
had
been
occupied
by
private
preston
it
was
no
she
remembered
one
shall
be
taken
and
the
other
left
she
thought
for
larry
there
was
the
glad
welcome
and
the
nursing
back
to
life
and
health
and
for
that
other
brave
boy
a
grave
in
a
foreign
land
some
lines
from
a
little
volume
of
verses
flashed
to
her
memory
they
had
struck
her
attention
only
a
week
before
and
she
had
learnt
them
by
heart
for
us
the
parting
and
the
sorrow
for
him
speed
one
fight
a
noble
deed
and
no
where
he
is
in
thy
peace
time
is
not
nor
smallest
sorrow
marjorie
was
almost
glad
that
on
her
next
exeat
at
the
tamarisks
elaine
was
away
from
home
she
was
afraid
her
cousin
might
speak
of
private
preston
and
she
did
not
wish
to
mention
his
name
again
i
afraid
you
be
dull
this
afternoon
without
elaine
said
aunt
ellinor
and
i
obliged
to
attend
a
committee
meeting
at
the
food
control
bureau
i
arranged
for
hodson
to
take
you
out
where
would
you
like
to
go
to
whitecliffe
and
have
tea
at
the
café
you
must
choose
exactly
what
you
think
would
be
nicest
as
the
girls
wished
to
do
a
little
shopping
they
decided
to
visit
whitecliffe
first
have
an
early
tea
at
the
café
and
then
take
a
walk
on
the
moor
ending
at
brackenfield
where
hodson
would
leave
them
that
all
right
then
said
trafford
i
sorry
i
ca
be
with
you
myself
get
some
sweets
at
the
café
and
have
some
ices
if
you
like
i
must
hurry
away
now
to
my
committee
hodson
wo
keep
you
waiting
long
i
told
her
to
get
ready
left
alone
the
girls
grumbled
a
little
at
the
necessity
of
taking
an
escort
with
them
at
fourteen
and
sixteen
we
surely
do
need
a
nursemaid
sniffed
marjorie
it
a
perfectly
ridiculous
rule
that
we
may
walk
ten
yards
by
ourselves
even
when
we
out
for
the
afternoon
we
might
be
interned
germans
or
conscientious
objectors
if
somebody
always
has
to
mount
guard
over
us
what
does
the
empress
think
we
going
to
do
i
wonder
ask
airmen
for
autographs
or
snowball
soldiers
twinkled
dona
oh
surely
she
forgotten
those
old
crimes
now
i
would
be
sure
the
empress
has
a
long
memory
besides
the
for
everybody
not
only
for
us
i
know
patricia
was
horribly
savage
last
week
an
officer
cousin
was
over
in
whitecliffe
and
she
was
allowed
to
go
and
meet
him
because
no
one
could
be
spared
to
act
chaperon
some
friends
asked
mona
to
tea
and
the
empress
would
let
her
accept
we
only
go
to
auntie
every
fortnight
because
mother
specially
stipulated
that
we
should
i
jolly
glad
she
did
it
makes
such
a
change
i
wish
hodson
would
hurry
up
hodson
the
housemaid
took
a
considerable
time
to
don
her
outdoor
garments
but
she
proclaimed
herself
ready
at
last
she
was
a
tall
woman
in
spectacles
with
large
teeth
and
showed
her
gums
when
she
talked
she
spoke
in
a
slow
melancholy
voice
and
to
judge
from
her
depressed
expression
evidently
considered
herself
a
martyr
for
the
afternoon
she
was
hardly
the
companion
the
girls
would
have
selected
but
they
had
to
make
the
best
of
her
it
would
be
amusing
at
any
rate
to
go
in
to
whitecliffe
marjorie
had
her
camera
and
wished
to
take
some
photographs
i
just
two
films
left
she
said
so
i
use
those
on
the
way
down
and
then
get
a
fresh
dozen
put
in
at
the
stores
let
us
go
by
the
high
road
so
that
we
can
pass
the
kiosk
and
ask
about
eric
the
attendant
at
the
lemonade
stall
smiled
brightly
at
mention
of
the
little
fellow
i
saw
his
pram
go
by
an
hour
ago
and
ran
out
and
gave
him
your
last
parcel
she
informed
them
you
very
likely
see
him
down
in
whitecliffe
he
left
his
love
for
you
i
hope
we
sha
miss
him
said
dona
round
the
very
next
turn
of
the
road
however
the
girls
met
the
invalid
carriage
coming
up
from
the
town
it
was
loaded
as
usual
with
many
packages
over
the
top
of
which
eric
small
white
face
peered
out
he
waved
a
gleeful
welcome
at
the
sight
of
his
fairy
ladies
i
read
all
the
stories
you
sent
me
he
began
and
i
nearly
finished
chalking
the
i
like
those
post
cards
of
fairies
i
put
them
all
in
the
album
he
thinks
such
a
lot
of
the
things
you
send
him
volunteered
lizzie
his
ma
says
she
does
know
how
to
thank
you
it
keeps
him
amused
for
hours
to
have
those
chalks
and
puzzles
he
sings
away
to
himself
over
them
as
happy
as
a
king
i
like
to
take
his
photo
while
i
got
the
camera
with
me
said
marjorie
can
you
turn
the
pram
round
a
little
so
that
better
i
do
want
the
sun
right
in
his
face
it
makes
him
screw
up
his
eyes
now
eric
look
at
me
and
put
on
your
best
smile
i
just
going
wait
a
moment
interrupted
dona
look
what
coming
up
the
road
you
only
two
films
remember
a
contingent
of
german
prisoners
were
being
marched
from
the
station
to
the
camp
on
the
moors
they
were
tramping
along
under
an
escort
of
soldiers
oh
i
must
snap
them
exclaimed
marjorie
but
i
have
eric
in
the
photo
too
i
can
just
get
them
all
in
she
moved
her
position
slightly
and
pressed
her
button
then
rapidly
winding
on
the
films
to
the
next
number
took
a
second
snapshot
the
light
was
excellent
and
they
ought
to
come
out
she
triumphed
how
jolly
to
have
got
a
photo
of
the
prisoners
eric
you
were
looking
just
fine
we
must
be
getting
on
home
said
lizzie
i
a
lot
of
cleaning
to
do
this
afternoon
when
i
get
back
say
to
the
ladies
eric
the
little
fellow
held
up
his
face
to
be
kissed
and
marjorie
and
dona
hugged
him
regardless
of
spectators
on
the
road
you
dear
wee
thing
take
care
of
yourself
said
dona
call
at
the
kiosk
next
time
you
pass
and
perhaps
another
parcel
will
have
arrived
from
fairyland
i
know
who
the
fairies
are
laughed
eric
as
his
perambulator
moved
away
escorted
by
the
melancholy
hodson
the
girls
passed
a
pleasant
enough
afternoon
in
whitecliffe
they
visited
several
shops
and
had
as
good
a
tea
at
the
café
as
the
rationing
order
allowed
supplementing
the
rather
scanty
supply
with
ices
and
sweets
it
was
much
too
early
yet
to
return
to
brackenfield
so
they
suggested
making
a
detour
round
the
moors
and
ending
up
at
school
hodson
acquiesced
in
her
usual
manner
i
a
good
walker
miss
she
volunteered
i
do
mind
where
you
go
it
all
the
same
to
me
as
long
as
i
see
you
back
into
school
by
six
trafford
said
i
was
to
let
you
be
late
i
brought
my
watch
with
me
and
we
got
ours
it
all
right
hodson
we
keep
an
eye
on
the
time
it
was
a
relief
to
know
that
hodson
was
a
good
walker
they
felt
justified
in
giving
her
a
little
exercise
they
were
quite
fresh
themselves
and
ready
for
a
country
tramp
they
left
the
town
by
a
short
cut
and
climbed
up
the
cliff
side
on
to
the
moors
though
they
knew
eric
would
not
be
there
that
afternoon
they
nevertheless
determined
to
visit
their
favourite
cove
it
was
an
excellent
place
for
flowers
and
dona
hoped
that
she
might
find
a
few
fresh
specimens
there
the
girls
had
reached
their
old
and
were
gathering
some
cranesbill
geraniums
when
a
figure
suddenly
climbed
the
wall
opposite
and
dropped
down
into
the
road
to
their
immense
amazement
it
was
miss
norton
she
stopped
at
the
sight
of
her
pupils
and
looked
profoundly
embarrassed
whether
at
being
caught
in
the
undignified
act
of
scrambling
over
a
wall
or
for
some
other
reason
they
could
not
judge
oh
i
was
just
taking
a
little
ramble
over
the
moors
she
explained
the
air
very
pleasant
this
afternoon
is
it
yes
replied
marjorie
briefly
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
miss
norton
nodded
and
passed
on
without
further
remark
the
girls
stood
watching
her
as
she
walked
down
the
road
what
norty
doing
up
here
queried
marjorie
she
not
fond
of
natural
history
and
she
does
much
like
walks
she
going
towards
the
village
i
vote
we
go
too
they
had
never
yet
been
to
the
village
and
though
elaine
had
described
it
as
not
worth
visiting
they
felt
curious
to
see
it
it
turned
out
to
be
a
straggling
row
of
rather
cottages
with
a
post
office
a
general
shop
and
a
miss
norton
must
have
already
passed
through
it
for
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
dona
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
into
the
window
of
the
shop
where
a
variety
of
miscellaneous
articles
were
displayed
they
actually
got
paradise
drops
she
murmured
i
have
bought
any
for
months
i
going
to
get
some
for
ailsa
followed
by
the
faithful
hodson
the
girls
entered
the
shop
while
dona
made
her
purchase
marjorie
stood
by
the
counter
staring
idly
out
into
the
road
she
saw
the
door
of
the
post
office
open
and
miss
norton
appeared
the
mistress
looked
carefully
up
and
down
the
village
then
walked
hurriedly
across
the
road
and
bolted
into
the
royal
george
opposite
marjorie
gasped
that
the
august
house
mistress
of
elgiva
should
visit
an
obscure
and
was
surely
a
most
unusual
circumstance
she
could
not
understand
it
at
all
she
discussed
it
with
dona
on
the
way
back
wanted
some
ginger
pop
perhaps
suggested
dona
she
could
have
got
that
at
the
shop
they
had
a
whole
case
of
bottles
no
dona
there
something
funny
about
it
the
fact
is
i
afraid
miss
norton
is
a
she
was
sympathizing
ever
so
much
with
those
prisoners
who
were
being
marched
into
camp
she
may
have
come
here
to
leave
some
message
for
them
you
know
it
was
never
found
out
who
put
that
lamp
in
the
observatory
window
it
was
certainly
a
signal
and
i
had
seen
norty
up
there
i
had
my
eye
on
her
ever
since
in
case
she
a
spy
she
can
talk
german
jolly
well
observed
dona
i
know
she
can
she
spent
two
years
in
germany
and
said
it
was
the
happiest
time
of
her
life
she
ca
be
patriotic
at
heart
to
say
that
do
you
know
winifrede
told
me
that
a
few
days
ago
she
and
jean
had
noticed
such
a
queer
light
dancing
about
on
the
hills
near
the
camp
it
was
just
as
if
somebody
was
heliographing
what
heliographing
dona
you
little
stupid
you
know
that
why
it
signalling
by
flashing
lights
there
a
regular
code
it
done
with
a
mirror
well
brackenfield
is
right
opposite
the
camp
and
it
would
be
quite
possible
for
norty
to
be
helioing
to
the
prisoners
they
always
on
the
for
somebody
to
communicate
with
them
and
help
them
to
escape
i
suppose
there
are
hundreds
of
spies
going
about
in
england
and
no
one
knows
who
they
are
they
just
pass
for
ordinary
innocent
kind
of
people
but
they
ask
all
kinds
of
questions
and
pick
up
scraps
of
information
that
will
be
useful
to
the
enemy
how
is
it
that
most
of
our
secrets
appear
in
the
berlin
papers
there
must
be
treachery
going
on
somewhere
it
generally
in
very
unsuspected
places
one
of
the
teachers
in
a
school
might
just
as
well
as
not
be
a
spy
how
dreadful
shuddered
dona
well
you
never
know
of
course
they
do
go
about
labelled
the
pay
of
the
kaiser
but
there
must
be
a
great
many
people
english
too
all
shame
to
them
who
are
receiving
money
from
germany
to
betray
their
country
chapter
xxii
the
magic
lantern
when
marjorie
took
an
idea
into
her
head
it
generally
for
the
time
filled
the
whole
of
her
mental
horizon
she
had
never
liked
miss
norton
and
she
now
mistrusted
her
the
evidence
that
she
had
to
go
upon
was
certainly
very
slight
but
as
marjorie
argued
straws
show
how
the
wind
blows
and
anyone
capable
of
sympathizing
with
germans
might
also
be
capable
of
assisting
them
she
felt
somewhat
in
the
position
of
hamlet
doubting
whether
she
had
really
surprised
a
dark
secret
or
not
and
anxious
for
more
circumstantial
evidence
before
she
told
others
of
her
suspicions
she
strictly
charged
dona
not
to
mention
meeting
miss
norton
in
the
little
hamlet
of
sandside
which
dona
readily
promised
she
was
not
imaginative
and
was
at
present
far
more
interested
in
rows
of
cauliflowers
or
specimens
of
seaweeds
than
in
problematical
german
spies
marjorie
with
several
detective
stories
fresh
in
her
memory
determined
to
go
to
work
craftily
she
set
little
traps
for
miss
norton
she
would
casually
ask
her
questions
about
germany
or
about
prisoners
of
war
to
judge
by
her
answers
where
her
sympathies
lay
the
mistress
however
was
evidently
on
her
guard
and
replied
in
terms
of
caution
one
thing
marjorie
learned
which
she
considered
might
be
a
suspicious
circumstance
miss
norton
received
many
letters
from
abroad
she
had
given
foreign
stamps
to
rose
butler
who
had
seen
her
tear
them
off
envelopes
marked
opened
by
the
censor
the
stamps
were
from
egypt
malta
switzerland
spain
holland
and
buenos
ayres
a
strange
variety
of
places
in
which
to
have
correspondents
so
thought
marjorie
of
course
they
opened
by
the
censor
but
who
knows
if
there
is
a
secret
cipher
under
the
guise
of
an
ordinary
letter
they
may
have
all
kinds
of
treasonable
secrets
in
them
norty
might
get
information
and
send
it
to
those
friends
in
foreign
countries
and
they
would
telegraph
it
in
code
through
a
neutral
country
to
berlin
she
ascertained
through
one
of
the
prefects
that
miss
norton
intended
to
spend
her
holidays
in
the
isle
of
wight
this
again
seemed
extraordinary
for
the
teacher
notoriously
suffered
greatly
from
the
heat
in
summer
and
yearned
for
a
bracing
climate
such
as
that
of
scotland
further
she
was
nervous
about
air
raids
so
that
the
south
coast
would
surely
be
a
very
unsuitable
spot
to
select
for
one
who
wished
to
take
a
restful
vacation
patricia
whose
parents
had
been
on
a
visit
to
whitecliffe
and
had
taken
her
out
on
a
saturday
afternoon
reported
that
at
the
hotel
some
foreigners
presumably
belgians
were
staying
and
that
she
had
noticed
miss
norton
drinking
coffee
with
them
in
the
lounge
are
you
sure
they
were
belgians
asked
marjorie
with
assumed
carelessness
why
the
people
in
the
hotel
said
so
what
were
they
like
oh
fair
and
rather
fat
one
of
them
was
a
madame
moeller
she
played
the
piano
beautifully
everybody
came
flocking
into
the
lounge
to
listen
to
her
moeller
does
sound
like
a
french
name
well
i
said
they
were
belgians
it
has
rather
a
german
smack
about
it
what
language
were
they
speaking
to
each
other
something
i
could
understand
not
french
certainly
was
it
german
i
do
know
any
german
so
i
ca
tell
it
might
have
been
flemish
marjorie
several
times
felt
tempted
to
confide
her
suspicions
to
winifrede
but
her
courage
never
rose
to
the
required
point
she
had
an
instinct
that
the
head
girl
would
the
whole
matter
and
either
call
her
a
ridiculous
child
or
be
rather
angry
with
her
for
harbouring
such
ideas
about
her
house
mistress
winifrede
liked
to
lead
and
was
never
very
ready
to
adopt
other
people
opinions
it
was
improbable
that
she
would
listen
readily
to
the
views
of
an
intermediate
even
of
one
whom
she
was
patronizing
a
head
girl
is
somewhat
in
the
position
of
the
lion
in
æsop
fables
it
is
unwise
to
offend
her
knowing
winifrede
disposition
marjorie
dared
not
risk
a
breach
of
the
very
desirable
intimacy
which
at
present
existed
between
them
she
yearned
however
for
a
confidante
the
burden
of
her
suspicions
was
heavy
to
bear
alone
and
she
felt
that
sometimes
two
heads
were
better
than
one
except
on
exeat
days
she
saw
little
of
dona
and
discussing
matters
with
that
rather
stolid
little
person
was
not
a
very
exhilarating
performance
in
her
dilemma
she
turned
to
chrissie
the
two
had
shared
the
secret
of
the
observatory
window
and
chrissie
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
members
of
their
patriotic
society
would
surely
understand
and
sympathize
where
winifrede
might
laugh
or
scold
marjorie
felt
that
she
had
lately
rather
neglected
her
chum
their
squabbles
had
caused
frequent
coolnesses
and
each
had
been
going
her
own
way
she
now
made
an
opportunity
to
walk
with
chrissie
down
the
dingle
and
confided
to
her
the
whole
story
of
her
doubts
her
chum
listened
very
attentively
it
looks
queer
she
commented
yes
more
than
queer
i
always
set
miss
norton
down
as
a
those
foreign
letters
ought
to
be
investigated
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
of
some
of
them
it
our
duty
to
look
after
this
marjorie
you
patriotic
well
so
am
i
we
may
be
able
to
render
a
great
service
to
our
country
if
we
can
track
down
a
spy
we
set
all
our
energies
to
work
what
are
we
going
to
do
asked
marjorie
much
impressed
leave
it
to
me
and
i
think
out
a
plan
of
campaign
these
things
are
a
battle
of
brains
she
clever
and
we
got
to
outwit
her
who
were
those
foreigners
she
was
talking
to
in
the
hotel
i
should
like
to
know
that
was
just
what
i
thought
for
a
beginning
we
must
try
to
draw
her
out
oh
do
ask
her
questions
about
her
german
sympathies
that
too
clumsy
she
see
through
that
in
a
moment
let
work
the
conversation
round
to
military
matters
and
munitions
and
get
the
girls
to
tell
all
they
heard
of
news
from
the
front
and
watch
whether
norty
is
just
snapping
it
up
would
that
be
letting
her
get
to
know
too
much
well
one
obliged
to
risk
something
if
you
you
never
get
anything
done
yes
i
suppose
you
right
we
try
on
sunday
evening
after
supper
she
always
comes
into
the
for
a
chat
with
us
then
chrissie
seemed
to
have
taken
up
the
matter
with
the
greatest
keenness
she
was
evidently
in
dead
earnest
about
it
marjorie
was
agreeably
surprised
and
on
the
strength
of
this
mutual
confidence
her
old
affection
for
her
chum
revived
once
more
they
went
about
the
school
arm
in
arm
sat
next
to
each
other
at
tea
and
wrote
each
other
private
little
notes
elgiva
smiled
again
but
the
girls
by
this
time
were
accustomed
to
marjorie
very
impulsive
and
rather
erratic
ways
and
did
not
take
her
infatuations
too
seriously
quarrelled
with
winifrede
enquired
patricia
humorously
i
thought
you
were
worshipping
at
her
shrine
at
present
marjorie
is
a
pagan
laughed
rose
butler
she
bows
down
to
many
idols
i
should
call
winifrede
a
more
desirable
goddess
than
chrissie
added
irene
go
on
tease
me
as
much
as
you
like
declared
marjorie
you
only
jealous
jealous
jealous
of
chrissie
lang
great
minerva
ejaculated
irene
eloquently
it
was
about
two
days
after
this
that
marjorie
passing
down
the
corridor
from
dormitory
no
came
suddenly
upon
chrissie
issuing
out
of
miss
norton
bedroom
marjorie
stopped
in
supreme
amazement
mistresses
rooms
were
sacred
at
brackenfield
unless
by
special
invitation
miss
norton
was
not
disposed
to
intimacy
and
it
was
not
in
the
knowledge
of
elgiva
that
she
had
admitted
any
girl
into
her
private
sanctum
did
norty
send
for
you
there
questioned
marjorie
in
a
whisper
sh
sh
replied
chrissie
come
back
with
me
into
the
dormitory
she
drew
her
friend
inside
her
cubicle
looked
round
the
room
to
see
that
they
were
alone
then
patted
her
pocket
and
smiled
i
got
them
she
triumphed
got
what
norty
foreign
letters
or
some
of
them
at
any
rate
chris
you
never
went
into
her
room
and
took
them
that
exactly
what
i
did
old
sport
i
going
to
look
them
over
and
put
them
back
before
she
finds
out
marjorie
gasped
but
look
here
it
does
seem
quite
straight
somehow
ca
be
helped
in
the
circumstances
replied
chrissie
laconically
we
got
to
outwit
her
somehow
it
a
case
of
meets
greek
how
else
are
we
to
find
out
anything
i
do
know
the
idea
of
entering
a
teacher
bedroom
and
taking
and
reading
her
private
correspondence
was
intensely
repugnant
to
marjorie
her
face
betrayed
her
feeling
you
never
do
on
secret
service
said
chrissie
shaking
her
head
i
thought
you
were
patriotic
enough
to
dare
anything
for
the
sake
of
your
country
go
downstairs
if
you
do
want
to
see
these
letters
i
read
them
by
myself
i
wish
you
put
them
back
at
once
urged
marjorie
not
till
i
know
what
in
them
here
comes
betty
i
going
to
scoot
marjorie
followed
chrissie
downstairs
but
did
not
join
her
in
the
garden
she
was
not
happy
about
this
latest
development
of
affairs
it
was
one
thing
to
watch
miss
norton
by
legitimate
methods
and
quite
another
to
try
underhand
ways
she
wondered
whether
the
service
of
her
country
really
demanded
such
a
sacrifice
of
honour
for
a
moment
she
felt
desperately
tempted
to
run
to
winifrede
study
explain
the
whole
situation
and
ask
her
opinion
but
she
remembered
that
winifrede
would
be
writing
her
weekly
essay
and
would
hardly
welcome
a
visitor
or
have
time
to
listen
to
the
rather
lengthy
story
which
she
must
pour
out
after
all
it
was
an
affair
that
her
own
conscience
must
decide
she
purposely
avoided
chrissie
all
the
evening
while
she
thought
it
over
having
slept
upon
the
question
she
came
to
a
decision
chris
she
said
catching
her
chum
privately
after
breakfast
i
vote
we
do
do
any
more
sneaking
tricks
sneaking
chrissie
eyebrows
went
up
high
yes
you
know
what
i
mean
we
keep
a
on
norty
but
no
more
taking
of
letters
please
chrissie
gazed
at
her
chum
with
rather
an
inscrutable
expression
right
oh
just
as
you
like
we
shelve
that
part
of
the
information
bureau
and
work
on
other
lines
i
quite
agreeable
that
particular
day
happened
to
be
miss
broadway
birthday
she
lived
at
elgiva
so
the
girls
determined
to
give
a
little
jollification
that
evening
in
her
honour
there
would
not
be
time
for
much
in
the
way
of
festivities
but
there
was
a
free
after
supper
when
they
could
have
the
recreation
room
to
themselves
it
was
to
be
a
private
affair
for
their
own
hostel
and
only
the
mistresses
who
resided
there
were
invited
the
entertainment
was
to
consist
of
a
magic
lantern
show
photography
had
raged
lately
as
a
hobby
among
the
intermediates
and
several
of
them
had
taken
to
making
lantern
slides
patricia
an
indulged
only
daughter
had
persuaded
her
father
to
buy
her
a
lantern
it
had
just
arrived
and
she
was
extremely
anxious
to
test
its
capabilities
she
put
up
her
screen
and
made
her
preparations
during
the
afternoon
so
that
when
supper
was
over
all
was
in
readiness
and
her
audience
took
their
places
without
delay
miss
norton
miss
parker
and
miss
broadway
had
specially
reserved
chairs
in
the
front
row
and
the
girls
filled
up
the
rest
of
the
room
some
of
them
to
obtain
a
better
view
squatted
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
chairs
chrissie
and
marjorie
being
among
the
number
the
lantern
worked
beautifully
patricia
made
a
capital
little
operator
and
managed
to
focus
very
clearly
she
first
of
all
showed
sets
of
bought
slides
scenes
from
italy
and
switzerland
and
photos
of
various
regiments
and
when
these
were
finished
she
turned
to
the
slides
which
she
and
her
chums
had
made
themselves
there
were
capital
pictures
of
the
school
the
cricket
eleven
the
hockey
team
the
quadrangle
in
the
snow
the
gardening
assistants
and
the
tennis
champions
they
were
received
with
much
applause
miss
norton
in
particular
congratulating
the
amateur
photographers
on
their
successful
efforts
we
have
had
time
to
do
very
many
said
patricia
but
i
got
just
a
few
more
here
this
is
a
good
clear
one
and
interesting
too
the
picture
which
she
now
threw
on
the
screen
showed
the
road
leading
to
whitecliffe
up
which
a
contingent
of
german
prisoners
appeared
guarded
by
soldiers
in
the
foreground
was
a
long
perambulator
holding
a
little
boy
propped
up
with
pillows
it
was
an
excellent
photograph
for
the
contingent
had
been
caught
just
at
the
right
moment
as
it
faced
the
camera
both
prisoners
and
guards
had
come
out
with
remarkable
clearness
something
impelled
marjorie
to
glance
at
miss
norton
the
house
mistress
was
gazing
at
the
picture
with
an
expression
of
amazed
horror
in
her
eyes
she
turned
quickly
to
irene
who
was
squatting
at
her
feet
and
asked
who
took
that
photo
marjorie
anderson
took
it
but
i
made
the
lantern
slide
from
her
film
answered
irene
proudly
we
think
it
quite
one
of
the
best
i
suppose
it
was
just
a
snapshot
as
she
stood
by
the
roadside
yes
it
was
a
very
lucky
one
was
it
marjorie
sitting
close
by
nudged
chrissie
but
did
not
speak
miss
norton
made
no
further
remark
and
patricia
put
on
the
next
slide
afterwards
in
the
corridor
marjorie
whispered
excitedly
to
chrissie
did
you
notice
norty
face
she
was
quite
upset
by
my
photo
of
the
german
prisoners
yes
i
noticed
her
significant
was
it
rather
it
like
the
play
scene
in
it
seems
to
me
she
gave
herself
away
she
was
taken
unawares
just
as
the
king
and
queen
were
you
remember
how
hamlet
watched
them
all
the
time
what
happened
only
confirms
our
suspicions
it
does
indeed
perhaps
some
of
her
german
friends
were
among
the
prisoners
and
she
recognized
them
it
possible
well
it
evidently
gave
her
a
great
shock
and
that
would
account
for
it
the
plot
thickens
it
thickens
very
much
indeed
i
not
sure
if
we
ought
to
tell
somebody
no
no
not
on
any
account
you
think
so
i
certain
of
it
you
spoil
everything
if
you
go
blabbing
well
i
wo
if
you
rather
not
but
i
just
longing
to
ask
winifrede
what
she
thinks
about
it
all
said
marjorie
regretfully
chapter
xxiii
on
leave
the
next
great
event
on
the
horizon
of
marjorie
and
dona
was
that
larry
was
transferred
from
the
london
military
hospital
to
the
whitecliffe
red
cross
hospital
anderson
came
to
the
tamarisks
for
a
night
as
soon
as
he
was
installed
and
paid
a
flying
visit
to
brackenfield
to
see
her
daughters
and
beg
an
exeat
that
she
might
take
them
to
spend
a
brief
with
their
brother
it
was
neither
a
wednesday
nor
a
saturday
but
in
the
circumstances
morrison
granted
permission
and
the
girls
rejoicing
at
missing
a
music
lesson
and
a
chemistry
lecture
were
borne
away
by
their
mother
for
the
afternoon
as
they
expected
they
found
larry
established
as
prime
pet
of
the
hospital
he
was
an
attractive
lad
already
a
favourite
with
his
cousin
elaine
and
his
handsome
boyish
face
and
prepossessing
manners
soon
won
him
the
good
graces
of
the
other
i
having
the
time
of
my
life
he
assured
his
family
i
sha
want
to
go
away
they
certainly
know
how
to
take
care
of
a
fellow
here
after
the
trenches
it
just
heaven
it
was
hard
luck
to
be
wounded
when
you
only
been
at
the
front
three
weeks
sympathized
dona
never
mind
i
got
on
the
roll
of
honour
before
my
nineteenth
birthday
triumphed
larry
and
i
go
back
and
have
another
shot
before
i
much
older
i
wish
the
military
age
were
sighed
anderson
and
i
wished
it
were
fifteen
when
the
war
started
laughed
larry
never
mind
little
muvviekins
peter
and
cyril
are
kids
enough
yet
you
can
tie
them
to
your
for
a
while
i
shall
go
home
feeling
quite
happy
at
leaving
you
in
such
good
hands
declared
his
mother
i
know
you
be
well
nursed
here
events
seemed
to
crowd
upon
one
another
for
hardly
was
larry
settled
in
the
red
cross
hospital
than
leonard
got
leave
and
after
first
going
home
came
for
a
hurried
visit
to
the
tamarisks
in
order
to
see
his
brother
anderson
wrote
to
morrison
asking
special
permission
for
the
girls
to
be
allowed
an
afternoon
with
their
brother
whom
they
had
not
seen
for
a
year
and
again
the
principal
relaxed
her
rule
in
their
favour
marjorie
nearly
wild
with
excitement
came
flying
into
the
at
elgiva
to
tell
the
news
to
her
friends
another
exeat
you
lucky
thing
exclaimed
betty
enviously
why
my
brother
come
to
whitecliffe
ca
you
bring
him
to
school
and
introduce
him
to
us
suggested
irene
or
take
some
of
us
out
with
you
amended
sylvia
we
simply
dying
to
meet
him
declared
patricia
he
has
only
the
one
afternoon
to
spare
replied
marjorie
and
has
promised
to
take
just
dona
and
me
out
to
tea
at
a
café
though
i
mind
betting
elaine
goes
too
i
wish
i
could
bring
him
to
school
and
introduce
him
the
empress
is
fearfully
mean
about
asking
brothers
brackenfield
might
be
a
convent
chrissie
also
seemed
tremendously
interested
in
leonard
arrival
she
walked
round
the
quad
with
marjorie
how
glorious
to
have
a
brother
home
from
the
front
she
said
wistfully
if
he
were
mine
i
nearly
worship
him
there
be
such
heaps
of
things
i
want
to
ask
him
too
i
like
to
hear
all
about
a
tank
you
seen
them
on
the
cinema
but
only
the
outside
of
course
i
want
to
know
exactly
how
they
work
do
laugh
why
should
i
surely
every
patriotic
girl
ought
to
be
keen
on
everything
in
connection
with
the
war
i
wish
you
ask
him
why
i
will
if
you
like
you
wo
forget
i
try
not
and
there
a
new
shell
we
just
been
making
i
wonder
how
it
answers
i
heard
we
some
new
guns
too
would
your
brother
know
really
i
shall
never
remember
all
this
pity
you
ca
come
with
us
and
ask
him
for
yourself
i
believe
i
could
get
an
exeat
began
chrissie
eagerly
i
sure
you
could
snapped
marjorie
dona
and
i
are
going
just
by
ourselves
the
sisters
spent
a
somewhat
disturbed
morning
it
was
difficult
to
concentrate
their
minds
on
lessons
when
such
a
delightful
outing
awaited
them
in
the
afternoon
immediately
after
dinner
they
rushed
to
their
dormitories
to
don
their
best
dresses
in
honour
of
leonard
they
knew
he
would
not
care
to
take
out
two
cinderellas
so
they
made
careful
toilets
marjorie
in
front
of
her
replaited
her
hair
and
tied
it
with
her
broadest
ribbon
chattering
all
the
while
to
chrissie
who
sat
on
the
bed
in
her
own
cubicle
leonard
an
old
dandy
at
least
he
was
a
year
ago
the
war
may
have
changed
him
he
used
to
be
most
fearfully
particular
and
notice
what
girls
had
on
i
remember
how
savage
he
was
with
nora
once
for
going
to
church
in
her
old
hat
and
it
was
such
a
wet
day
too
she
did
want
to
spoil
her
new
one
he
always
kept
his
trousers
in
stretchers
and
his
boots
had
to
be
polished
ever
so
chrissie
you
not
listening
actually
opening
letters
you
mean
to
say
you
not
read
them
yet
and
you
got
them
this
morning
i
had
time
said
chrissie
rather
abstractedly
she
was
drawing
pound
notes
out
of
the
envelope
sophonisba
what
a
lot
of
money
exclaimed
marjorie
it
is
your
birthday
no
this
is
to
take
me
home
of
course
it
wo
cost
you
all
that
surely

railway
fare

morrison

mother

like
me
to
be
short
of
money
on
the
journey
remarked
chrissie
serenely
locking
up
the
notes
in
her
little
at
precisely
two
the
melancholy
hodson
arrived
at
the
school
and
escorted
marjorie
and
dona
to
the
tamarisks
here
they
found
leonard
and
it
was
a
very
happy
meeting
between
the
brother
and
sisters
leonard
shall
take
you
into
the
town
said
aunt
ellinor
i
know

to

an
hour

smiled
elaine
yes
i
give
your
love
to
larry
i
sorry
you
ca
see
him
but
the
commandant
a
little
strict
about
visiting
we
concentrate
on
leonard
declared
the
girls
it
was
an
immense
satisfaction
to
them
to
trot
off
one
on
each
side
of
their
soldier
brother
they
felt
very
proud
of
him
as
they
walked
along
the
promenade
and
noticed
people
glance
approvingly
at
the
young
officer
after
going
on
the
pier
and
doing
the
usual
sights
of
whitecliffe
leonard
took
them
to
the
cliff
hotel
and
ordered
tea
on
the
terrace
dona
and
marjorie
were
all
smiles
this
was
far
superior
to
a
café
the
terrace
was
delightful
with
geraniums
and
oleanders
in
large
pots
and
a
beautiful
view
over
the
sea
they
had
a
little
table
to
themselves
at
the
end
underneath
a
tree
it
was
something
to
have
a
brother
home
from
the
front
tell
us
everything
you
do
out
in
france
begged
dona
you
would
like
to
hear
everything
baby
bunting
returned
leonard
gravely
it
not
fit
for
your
ears
be
glad
that
you
in
england
see
anything
of
the
war
there
one
little
incident
i
can
tell
you
though
we
marched
many
miles
through
the
night
over
appalling
ground
under
scattered
and
were
only
in
our
place
of
attack
half
an
hour
before
the
advance
started
up
the
ridge
that
night
march
is
a
story
in
itself
but
that
not
what
i
going
to
tell
you
now
we
drew
close
to
one
of
the
blockhouses
and
the
sound
of
our
cheering
must
have
been
heard
by
the
germans
inside
those
concrete
walls
the
barrage
had
just
passed
and
its
line
of
fire
volcanic
in
its
fury
went
travelling
ahead
suddenly
out
of
the
blockhouse
a
dozen
men
or
so
came
running
and
we
shortened
our
bayonets
from
the
centre
of
the
group
a
voice
shouted
out
in
english
a
warwickshire
man
do
shoot
i
an
englishman
the
man
who
called
had
his
hands
up
in
sign
of
surrender
like
the
german
soldiers
a
spy
said
one
of
our
men
the
blighter
the
voice
again
rang
out
english
and
he
was
english
too
it
was
a
man
of
a
warwickshire
regiment
who
had
been
captured
on
patrol
some
days
before
the
germans
had
taken
him
into
their
blockhouse
and
because
of
our
they
could
not
get
out
of
it
and
kept
him
there
he
was
well
treated
and
his
captors
shared
their
food
with
him
but
the
awful
moment
came
for
him
when
the
passed
and
he
knew
that
unless
he
held
his
hands
high
he
would
be
killed
by
our
own
troops
how
awful
shivered
dona
tell
us
some
more
tales
about
the
war
begged
marjorie
i
might
have
been
killed
one
evening
said
leonard
if
it
had
been
for
a
friend
we
were
carrying
dispatches
and
fell
into
an
ambush
i
owe
it
to
winkles
that
i
here
he
fought
like
a
demon
i
never
saw
such
a
fellow
who
winkles
oh
an
awfully
good
chap
and
so
humorous
i
never
once
seen
him
down
i
got
his
photo
somewhere
i
believe
i
took
a
snapshot
of
him
once
oh
do
show
it
to
us
leonard
searched
through
his
pockets
and
after
turning
out
an
assortment
of
letters
and
papers
produced
a
small
photograph
for
inspection
the
girls
bumped
their
heads
together
in
their
eagerness
to
look
at
it
it
had
been
taken
in
camp
and
represented
the
young
soldier
in
the
act
of
raising
a
can
of
coffee
to
his
lips
there
was
a
pleased
smile
on
the
whimsical
face
and
a
twinkle
in
the
dark
eyes
marjorie
caught
her
breath
why
why
she
gasped
it
surely
private
preston
that
his
name
right
enough
we
call
him
winkles
though
he
a
lieutenant
now
by
the
way
got
his
commission
just
lately
but
i
thought
he
was
killed
not
a
bit
of
it
i
heard
from
him
yesterday
he
was
in
the
roll
of
honour
urged
marjorie
still
unable
to
believe
no
he
was
that
was
his
brother
henry
who
was
in
the
same
regiment
a
nice
chap
though
nothing
to
winkles
marjorie
sat
in
a
state
of
almost
dazed
incomprehension
a
black
cloud
seemed
suddenly
to
have
rolled
away
from
her
and
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
readjust
herself
as
in
a
dream
she
listened
to
explanation
he
was
in
the
red
cross
hospital
here
and
we
saw
him
when
elaine
took
us
to
the
christmas
tree
was
it
whitecliffe
i
knew
he
been
in
a
red
cross
hospital
but
never
heard
which
one
commented
leonard
he
was
going
on
to
a
convalescent
home
continued
dona
he
came
back
to
the
front
before
he
was
really
fit
said
leonard
the
poor
chap
had
had
influenza
but
he
was
so
afraid
of
being
thought
a
shirker
that
he
made
a
push
to
go
he
was
laid
up
with
a
touch
of
pneumonia
i
remember
a
week
after
he
rejoined
will
he
get
leave
again
faltered
marjorie
yes
next
month
he
hopes
they
do
live
such
a
very
long
way
from
silverwood
and
he
said
he
try
to
go
over
and
see
the
mater
give
him
a
welcome
i
know
rather
agreed
the
girls
we
shall
be
at
home
in
august
added
dona
marjorie
however
said
nothing
there
are
some
joys
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
express
to
outsiders
i
glad
they
made
him
a
lieutenant
she
said
to
herself
chapter
xxiv
the
royal
george
when
leonard
brought
marjorie
and
dona
back
to
the
tamarisks
there
was
still
one
more
golden
before
they
need
return
to
school
aunt
ellinor
proposed
tennis
and
suggested
that
her
nephew
should
play
his
sisters
while
she
sat
and
acted
umpire
the
game
went
fairly
evenly
for
leonard
was
agile
and
equal
to
holding
his
own
though
it
was
one
against
two
they
were
at
forty
all
when
dona
made
a
rather
brilliant
stroke
leonard
sprang
across
the
court
in
a
frantic
effort
to
get
the
ball
missed
it
slipped
on
the
grass
and
fell
the
girls
laughed
you
been
a
little
too
clever
for
once
called
dona
that
our
game
get
up
you
old
slacker
said
marjorie
but
leonard
did
not
get
up
he
stayed
where
he
was
on
the
lawn
looking
very
white
trafford
ran
to
him
in
alarm
what
the
matter
she
cried
i
believe
i
broken
my
ankle
i
felt
it
snap
the
accident
was
so
totally
unexpected
that
for
a
moment
everyone
was
staggered
then
recovering
her
presence
of
mind
aunt
ellinor
with
marjorie
and
dona
help
applied
first
aid
while
hodson
hurried
into
whitecliffe
to
fetch
the
doctor
he
was
fortunately
at
home
and
came
at
once
he
helped
to
carry
leonard
into
the
house
set
the
broken
bone
and
settled
him
in
bed
you
have
to
stay
where
you
are
for
a
while
he
assured
him
there
be
no
walking
on
that
foot
yet
it
extend
your
leave
at
any
rate
i
ca
imagine
how
i
was
such
an
idiot
as
to
do
it
mourned
leonard
i
just
seemed
to
trip
and
could
save
myself
we
borrow
you
some
crutches
from
the
red
cross
when
you
well
enough
to
use
them
laughed
the
doctor
you
be
well
looked
after
here
miss
elaine
is
one
of
my
best
nurses
at
the
hospital
marjorie
and
dona
arrived
back
at
school
late
for
preparation
but
were
graciously
forgiven
by
morrison
when
they
explained
the
unfortunate
reason
of
their
delay
it
ripping
to
have
both
leonard
and
larry
at
whitecliffe
said
dona
to
marjorie
in
private
rather
i
think
i
know
one
person
who
wo
altogether
regret
the
accident
leonard
yes
leonard
certainly
but
somebody
else
too
i
know
elaine
she
have
the
time
of
her
life
nursing
him
and
he
have
the
time
of
his
life
being
nursed
by
elaine
laughed
dona
it
was
now
getting
very
near
the
end
of
the
term
and
each
hostel
according
to
its
usual
custom
was
beginning
to
devise
some
form
of
entertainment
to
which
it
could
invite
the
rest
of
the
school
after
much
consultation
elgiva
decided
on
charades
a
cast
was
chosen
consisting
of
eight
girls
who
were
considered
to
act
best
betty
chrissie
and
marjorie
being
among
the
number
no
parts
were
to
be
learnt
but
a
general
outline
of
each
charade
was
to
be
arranged
beforehand
the
performers
filling
in
impromptu
dialogue
as
they
went
along
to
hit
on
a
suitable
word
and
think
out
some
telling
scenes
now
occupied
the
wits
of
each
of
the
chosen
eight
they
compared
notes
constantly
indeed
when
any
happy
thought
occurred
to
one
she
made
haste
to
communicate
it
to
the
others
an
inspiration
came
suddenly
to
marjorie
during
cricket
and
when
the
game
was
over
she
rushed
away
to
unburden
herself
of
it
she
had
thought
several
of
the
performers
might
be
in
the
recreation
room
but
she
found
nobody
there
except
chrissie
who
sat
writing
at
the
table
i
a
lovely
idea
chris
she
began
you
know
that
word
we
chose
well
we
have
the
first
syllable
in
a
red
cross
hospital
and
the
second
in
an
employment
bureau
and
a
girl
can
ask
if
there
any
fee
to
pay
and
the
whole
word
can
be
a
scene
in
a
chrissie
do
stop
writing
and
listen
her
chum
shut
up
her
geometry
textbook
rather
reluctantly
she
was
putting
in
extra
work
before
the
exams
and
was
loath
to
be
interrupted
she
kept
on
drawing
angles
on
her
almost
automatically
they
be
ripping
if
we
could
get
the
right
properties
she
agreed
could
we
manage
beds
enough
to
look
like
a
hospital
yes
those
small
forms
would
do
i
dare
say
the
employment
bureau
will
be
easy
enough
the
scene
would
be
no
end
if
we
could
make
it
i
ought
to
be
an
officer
home
on
leave
and
you
my
love
and
we
have
a
dramatic
meeting
over
the
coffee
cups
gorgeous
oh
we
must
do
it
shall
i
droop
tenderly
into
your
arms
what
shall
i
wear
some
outdoor
costume
with
a
picturesque
hat
i
must
have
a
uniform
of
course
a
brown
waterproof
with
a
leather
belt
chrissie
pulled
a
face
i
hate
these
out
of
girls
clothes
i
like
a
real
genuine
uniform
to
do
the
thing
properly
but
we
could
get
one
yes
we
could
it
your
exeat
on
wednesday
and
you
might
borrow
your
brother
he
in
bed
and
ca
wear
it
what
a
ripping
notion
gasped
marjorie
but
i
could
carry
a
great
parcel
back
to
school
norty
see
it
and
make
one
of
her
stupid
fusses
we
must
smuggle
it
then
look
here
when
you
go
to
your
aunt
make
the
clothes
into
a
parcel
and
leave
it
just
inside
the
gate
i
a
friend
at
whitecliffe
and
i
manage
to
write
to
her
and
ask
her
to
call
and
take
it
and
drop
it
over
the
wall
at
brackenfield
for
me
wo
norty
ask
where
we
got
it
when
she
sees
you
wearing
it
she
might
be
nasty
about
it
beforehand
but
i
do
believe
she
say
anything
on
the
evening
especially
if
the
charade
goes
off
well
worth
risking
you
look
ripping
in
leonard
uniform
of
course
it
would
be
too
big
that
would
matter
will
you
get
it
for
me
right
oh
good
then
i
write
to
my
friend
you
writing
now
chuckled
marjorie
for
chrissie
had
been
scribbling
idly
on
the
while
she
talked
look
what
you
put
you
goose
lange
do
you
know
how
to
spell
your
own
name
i
did
think
it
had
an
at
the
end
of
it
chrissie
flushed
scarlet
for
a
moment
she
looked
overwhelmed
with
confusion
then
recovering
herself
she
forced
a
laugh
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
ca
imagine
why
i
should
stick
on
an
extra
lang
is
a
good
old
scottish
name
are
you
related
to
andrew
lang
the
famous
author
i
believe
there
a
family
connection
the
charades
were
to
be
held
on
the
evening
of
the
next
wednesday
after
supper
which
was
fixed
half
an
hour
earlier
to
allow
sufficient
time
for
the
festivities
afterwards
that
afternoon
would
be
marjorie
and
dona
last
exeat
before
the
holidays
and
they
were
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
they
would
of
course
visit
leonard
and
larry
and
they
also
wished
if
possible
to
say
to
eric
they
had
begged
elaine
to
leave
a
note
at
the
kiosk
asking
him
to
be
waiting
at
their
old
on
the
cliffs
at
five
and
they
meant
to
take
him
some
last
little
presents
if
they
did
not
see
him
it
would
be
the
end
of
september
before
they
could
meet
again
he
miss
the
fairy
ladies
when
we
gone
home
said
dona
sweet
darling
i
wish
we
could
take
him
with
us
i
wonder
if
he
ever
goes
away
speculated
marjorie
i
should
think
he
be
strong
enough
to
travel
when
the
girls
arrived
at
the
tamarisks
they
found
leonard
installed
in
bed
a
remarkably
cheerful
invalid
and
apparently
not
fretting
over
his
enforced
period
of
rest
i
got
a
little
red
cross
hospital
here
all
to
myself
he
informed
his
sisters
a
jolly
nice
one
too
i
can
thoroughly
recommend
it
i
sha
want
to
budge
then
they
send
an
army
doctor
down
to
examine
you
for
shirking
laughed
marjorie
i
ca
hop
back
to
the
front
on
one
leg
objected
leonard
elaine
was
head
nurse
in
the
afternoons
an
arrangement
which
seemed
to
be
appreciated
equally
by
herself
and
the
patient
i
run
up
with
you
to
the
red
cross
hospital
to
see
larry
she
assured
marjorie
and
dona
but
i
ought
to
leave
leonard
hodson
shall
take
you
and
go
on
with
you
to
the
cove
afterwards
give
my
love
to
eric
i
hope
the
dear
little
fellow
is
better
i
bought
the
things
for
him
as
you
asked
me
they
on
the
table
in
the
hall
we
have
tea
in
leonard
room
before
you
start
under
a
pretence
of
inspecting
eric
presents
marjorie
ran
downstairs
she
wanted
somehow
to
get
hold
of
leonard
uniform
and
she
was
afraid
that
if
she
mentioned
it
elaine
in
her
capacity
of
nurse
would
say
no
i
sha
ask
decided
marjorie
elaine
is
a
little
and
inclined
to
appropriate
leonard
all
to
herself
at
present
surely
his
own
sister
can
borrow
his
uniform
i
know
it
in
the
i
could
see
it
and
i
got
up
and
shut
the
door
on
purpose
i
go
round
by
the
other
door
and
take
it
the
deed
was
quickly
done
leonard
was
lying
open
on
the
floor
and
she
packed
in
it
what
she
wanted
not
without
tremors
lest
elaine
should
come
in
suddenly
from
the
bedroom
and
catch
her
she
could
hear
nurse
and
invalid
laughing
together
bag
in
hand
she
hurried
downstairs
and
out
into
the
garden
down
by
the
gate
a
woman
was
already
hanging
about
waiting
it
would
be
the
work
of
a
moment
to
give
it
to
her
but
marjorie
had
not
calculated
upon
dona
that
placid
young
person
usually
accepted
whatever
her
elder
sister
thought
fit
to
do
on
this
occasion
she
interfered
what
are
you
doing
with
leonard
she
asked
marjorie
hastily
explained
do
begged
dona
promptly
leonard
will
be
fearfully
savage
about
it
how
are
you
going
to
get
his
things
back
to
him
i
do
know
stammered
marjorie
she
had
indeed
never
thought
about
it
i
been
watching
that
woman
urged
dona
and
i
do
like
her
she
asked
me
if
this
were
tamarisks
and
she
speaks
quite
broken
english
you
must
give
her
leonard
uniform
but
i
promised
to
get
it
for
chrissie
to
act
in
marjorie
i
tell
you
i
do
trust
chrissie
the
woman
seeing
the
two
girls
came
inside
the
gate
and
advanced
smilingly
towards
them
marjorie
annoyed
at
dona
interference
and
anxious
to
have
her
own
way
greeted
the
stranger
effusively
have
you
come
for
the
bag
for
miss
lang
thanks
so
much
here
it
is
then
for
once
in
her
life
dona
asserted
herself
no
it
is
she
snapped
and
snatching
the
bag
from
her
hand
she
rushed
with
it
into
the
house
marjorie
followed
in
a
towering
passion
but
her
remonstrances
were
useless
dona
when
she
once
took
an
idea
into
her
head
was
the
most
obstinate
person
in
the
world
leonard
things
are
back
in
the
and
i
opened
the
door
wide
into
his
bedroom
she
announced
doggedly
if
you
want
to
get
them
you
have
to
take
them
from
under
elaine
nose
full
of
wrath
marjorie
had
nevertheless
to
make
the
best
of
it
the
woman
had
vanished
from
the
garden
and
elaine
was
calling
to
them
that
tea
was
ready
in
leonard
bedroom
the
invalid
had
a
splendid
appetite
and
as
his
nurse
did
not
consider
that
he
ought
to
be
rationed
the
war
buns
disappeared
rapidly
it
picnicking
here
with
you
girls
he
announced
some
of
our
fellows
at
the
front
be
green
with
envy
if
they
only
knew
marjorie
was
distant
with
dona
all
the
way
to
the
red
cross
hospital
but
recovered
her
temper
during
the
ten
minutes
spent
with
larry
they
were
not
allowed
to
stay
long
as
it
was
out
of
visiting
hours
though
elaine
had
obtained
special
permission
from
the
commandant
for
them
to
call
and
say
to
him
still
laughing
at
his
absurd
jokes
they
rejoined
hodson
and
set
off
along
the
road
over
the
moor
as
they
neared
the
cove
they
looked
out
anxiously
to
see
if
eric
were
at
the
usual
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
they
sat
down
and
waited
thinking
that
the
long
perambulator
had
probably
been
wheeled
into
whitecliffe
and
had
not
yet
returned
in
about
ten
minutes
lizzie
came
hurrying
up
alone
i
run
all
the
way
she
panted
he
got
your
letter
did
eric
and
he
was
that
set
on
coming
but
he
very
ill
and
must
stop
in
bed
he
just
fretting
his
heart
out
because
he
ca
say
to
you
he
say
nothing
all
the
time
but
want
my
fairy
ladies
i
want
my
fairy
ladies
his
ma
said
she
wondered
if
you
mind
coming
in
for
a
minute
just
to
see
him
it
not
far
it
would
soothe
him
down
wonderful
why
of
course
we
go
exclaimed
the
girls
with
enthusiasm
poor
little
chap
what
a
shame
he
ill
i
hope
it
nothing
infectious
objected
hodson
mindful
of
her
duties
oh
no
it
his
heart
answered
lizzie
he
got
a
lot
of
different
things
the
matter
with
him
and
has
had
ever
so
many
doctors
she
added
almost
proudly
she
led
the
way
briskly
to
the
little
village
of
sandside
where
did
eric
live
the
girls
were
asking
themselves
they
had
always
wondered
where
his
home
could
be
to
their
amazement
lizzie
stopped
at
the
royal
george
inn
and
motioned
them
to
enter
hodson
demurred
she
was
an
ardent
teetotaller
and
also
she
doubted
if
trafford
would
approve
of
her
nieces
visiting
at
a
wait
for
us
outside
hodson
said
marjorie
rather
peremptorily
i
go
into
the
post
office
she
agreed
unwillingly
you
wo
be
long
will
you
miss
the
passage
inside
the
inn
was
dark
and
the
stairs
were
steep
and
a
smell
of
stale
beer
pervaded
the
air
it
seemed
a
strange
place
for
such
a
lovely
flower
as
eric
to
be
growing
lizzie
went
first
to
show
the
way
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
his
ma
had
to
go
and
serve
in
the
bar
she
explained
but
his
aunt
just
come
and
is
sitting
with
him
dona
and
marjorie
entered
a
small
low
bedroom
clean
enough
though
rather
faded
and
shabby
in
a
cot
bed
by
the
window
lay
eric
white
as
his
pillow
a
frail
ethereal
being
all
dark
eyes
and
shining
golden
curls
he
stretched
out
two
feeble
little
arms
in
welcome
oh
my
fairy
ladies
have
you
really
come
he
cried
eagerly
it
was
only
when
they
had
both
flown
to
him
and
kissed
him
that
the
girls
had
time
to
notice
the
figure
that
sat
by
his
bedside
a
figure
that
with
red
spots
of
consternation
on
its
cheeks
rose
hastily
from
its
seat
miss
norton
they
gasped
both
together
the
mistress
recovered
herself
with
an
effort
sit
down
dona
and
marjorie
she
said
with
apparent
calm
placing
two
chairs
for
them
i
did
not
know
you
were
eric
fairy
ladies
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
and
see
him
this
is
titania
said
the
little
fellow
proudly
snuggling
his
hand
into
his
aunt
she
knows
more
fairy
tales
than
there
are
in
all
the
books
you
never
heard
such
lovely
tales
as
she
can
tell
another
please
titania
not
now
darling
please
please
the
one
about
the
moon
maiden
and
the
stars
the
dark
eyes
were
pleading
and
the
small
mouth
quivered
the
child
looked
too
ill
to
be
reasoned
with
do
mind
us
blurted
out
marjorie
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
dona
was
blinking
some
out
of
her
eyes
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
for
miss
norton
beforetime
the
cold
strict
house
mistress
dropped
her
mask
of
reserve
and
throwing
a
tender
arm
round
eric
began
a
tale
of
elves
and
fairies
she
told
it
well
too
with
a
pretty
play
of
fancy
and
an
understanding
of
a
child
mind
he
listened
with
supreme
satisfaction
is
it
lovely
he
said
turning
in
triumph
to
the
girls
when
the
story
was
finished
we
must
trot
now
darling
said
his
aunt
laying
him
gently
back
on
the
pillow
what
more
presents
you
lucky
boy
suppose
you
open
them
after
we
gone
you
be
such
a
tired
childie
if
you
get
too
excited
i
send
lizzie
up
to
you
say
to
your
fairy
ladies
darling
bluebell
darling
silverstar
when
am
i
going
to
see
you
again
ah
when
indeed
thought
dona
and
marjorie
as
they
walked
down
the
steep
dark
stairs
of
the
little
inn
chapter
xxv
charades
hodson
was
waiting
in
the
road
when
they
came
out
miss
norton
spoke
to
her
kindly
we
need
not
trouble
you
to
take
the
young
ladies
back
to
brackenfield
they
can
return
with
me
across
the
moor
she
said
i
dare
say
you
are
anxious
to
get
home
to
the
tamarisks
yes
thank
you
m
it
got
rather
late
answered
hodson
gratefully
setting
off
at
once
along
the
whitecliffe
road
the
girls
and
miss
norton
took
a
short
cut
across
the
moor
they
walked
on
for
a
while
in
silence
then
the
mistress
said
i
did
know
it
was
you
two
who
have
been
so
kind
to
eric
i
should
like
to
explain
about
him
and
then
you
understand
my
eldest
brother
married
very
much
beneath
him
he
died
when
eric
was
a
year
old
and
his
wife
married
again
a
man
in
her
own
station
who
is
now
keeping
the
george
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
eric
being
brought
up
in
such
surroundings
but
i
have
no
power
to
take
him
away
his
mother
and
claim
him
i
had
planned
that
when
he
is
a
little
older
i
would
try
to
persuade
them
to
let
me
send
him
to
a
good
preparatory
school
but
now
her
voice
broke
it
is
not
a
question
of
education
but
whether
he
will
grow
up
at
all
i
am
writing
for
a
specialist
to
come
and
see
him
next
week
i
wo
give
up
hope
he
the
only
boy
left
in
our
family
both
my
other
brothers
were
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
i
sure
understand
that
i
did
not
want
anybody
at
brackenfield
to
know
that
my
relations
live
at
a
village
inn
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
to
morrison
may
i
ask
you
both
to
keep
my
secret
and
not
to
mention
the
matter
at
school
we
wo
tell
a
soul
miss
norton
the
girls
assured
her
thank
you
both
for
your
kindness
to
eric
continued
the
house
mistress
you
have
made
his
little
life
very
bright
lately
i
need
hardly
tell
you
how
dear
he
is
to
me
he
the
most
perfect
darling
we
ever
met
said
dona
after
that
they
walked
on
again
without
speaking
all
three
were
busy
with
their
own
thoughts
marjorie
brain
was
in
a
whirl
she
was
trying
to
readjust
her
mental
attitude
miss
norton
miss
norton
whom
she
had
mistrusted
and
suspected
as
a
spy
was
eric
idolized
aunt
and
had
gone
to
the
royal
george
on
no
treacherous
errand
but
to
tell
fairy
tales
to
an
invalid
child
when
the
cold
scholastic
manner
was
dropped
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
beautiful
and
tender
side
of
the
mistress
nature
she
would
never
forget
miss
norton
face
as
she
held
the
little
fellow
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
i
afraid
i
utterly
misjudged
her
decided
marjorie
i
see
now
why
she
was
so
upset
about
that
lantern
slide
i
took
it
was
because
eric
was
in
it
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
german
prisoners
after
all
anybody
can
receive
foreign
letters
if
they
relations
abroad
and
perhaps
she
going
to
stay
with
friends
in
the
isle
of
wight
as
for
those
belgians
in
the
hotel
perhaps
they
were
genuine
ones
we
had
belgian
guests
ourselves
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
understand
a
word
of
the
flemish
they
talked
marjorie
ran
upstairs
to
her
dormitory
as
soon
as
she
reached
elgiva
and
found
chrissie
waiting
for
her
there
where
the
uniform
demanded
her
chum
imperatively
the
uniform
i
did
get
it
after
all
replied
marjorie
a
little
vaguely
the
unexpected
episode
of
eric
and
miss
norton
had
temporarily
driven
the
former
matter
from
her
mind
you
did
get
it
chrissie
said
the
words
very
slowly
no
i
sorry
but
it
could
be
helped
elaine
was
there
and
dona
would
let
me
so
you
sneak
blazed
chrissie
passionately
you
promised
you
promised
faithfully
and
this
is
how
you
treat
me
oh
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
what
shall
i
do
ca
you
go
back
for
it
send
for
it
i
tell
you
i
must
have
it
how
can
i
go
back
for
it
or
send
for
it
retorted
marjorie
amazed
at
such
an
outburst
on
the
part
of
her
chum
i
sorry
but
after
all
it
would
have
been
miles
too
big
for
you
and
you
really
do
the
part
quite
as
well
in
my
mackintosh
with
irene
broad
leather
belt
a
piece
of
brown
calico
we
can
cut
into
strips
and
make
puttees
for
you
you
look
very
nice
i
sure
chrissie
hardly
seemed
to
be
listening
she
was
sitting
on
her
bed
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
in
the
greatest
emotion
when
marjorie
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
she
flung
her
off
passionately
she
had
never
exhibited
such
temper
before
and
marjorie
was
frankly
surprised
the
occasion
did
not
seem
to
justify
it
the
disappointment
about
the
costume
could
not
surely
be
so
very
keen
none
of
the
girls
had
meant
to
dress
up
to
any
great
extent
for
the
charades
chrissie
do
be
an
idiot
there
was
no
answer
what
are
you
making
such
a
hullabaloo
about
you
the
limit
this
evening
do
for
goodness
sake
brace
up
let
me
alone
snapped
chrissie
you
called
yourself
my
friend
and
you
would
do
what
i
asked
you
i
done
with
you
now
do
speak
to
me
again
pitch
it
a
little
stronger
i
go
away
till
you
got
over
your
tantrums
it
what
used
to
be
called
katawampus
when
i
was
small
and
they
generally
spanked
me
for
it
ca
you
go
thundered
chrissie
thoroughly
angry
with
her
chum
marjorie
went
she
wondered
how
they
were
going
to
act
a
love
scene
together
that
evening
the
soft
nothings
they
had
rehearsed
would
seem
very
hollow
after
the
mutual
reproaches
they
had
just
exchanged
chrissie
was
not
in
her
usual
place
at
sulking
thought
marjorie
i
suppose
she
does
want
to
sit
next
to
me
well
she
punishing
herself
far
more
than
me
silly
girl
she
must
be
dreadfully
hungry
unless
she
shamming
a
headache
and
getting
nurse
to
give
her
bread
and
milk
in
the
ambulance
room
perhaps
busy
with
her
costume
she
never
liked
the
idea
of
using
my
mackintosh
for
a
uniform
i
expect
she
thought
of
something
else
marjorie
anger
always
hot
while
it
lasted
but
was
beginning
to
cool
down
when
supper
was
over
she
ran
to
look
for
her
chum
but
could
not
find
her
anywhere
there
was
no
time
for
a
long
search
as
the
charades
were
to
begin
almost
at
once
and
the
elgiva
girls
were
already
preparing
the
stage
for
the
first
scene
marjorie
was
seized
upon
by
patricia
and
borne
off
to
arrange
screens
and
furniture
punctual
to
a
moment
the
guests
from
the
other
hostels
arrived
and
took
their
seats
as
audience
the
performers
in
the
little
room
behind
the
platform
were
breathlessly
scuttling
into
their
costumes
and
all
talking
at
once
where
my
hat
illustration
she
stared
at
it
in
consternation
do
button
this
at
the
back
for
me
please
i
ca
find
my
boots
oh
bother
this
skirt
has
no
hooks
who
got
the
safety
pins
be
careful
you
tear
that
lace
i
ca
get
into
these
shoes
they
too
small
i
grown
out
of
this
skirt
since
last
theatricals
it
miles
too
short
has
anybody
seen
my
belt
each
one
was
so
occupied
in
finishing
her
own
hasty
toilet
that
she
could
not
give
much
thought
to
the
others
and
it
was
only
when
all
were
ready
that
patricia
asked
where
chrissie
the
girls
looked
round
in
consternation
she
was
certainly
not
in
the
betty
ran
on
to
the
platform
drew
aside
the
curtain
a
little
and
beckoning
annie
turner
from
among
the
audience
sent
her
and
six
other
intermediates
in
search
of
the
missing
performer
they
returned
in
a
few
minutes
to
say
that
they
could
not
find
her
marjorie
meantime
had
explained
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
it
sickening
raged
betty
for
her
to
go
and
spoil
the
whole
thing
just
out
of
temper
i
like
to
shake
her
everybody
waiting
for
us
to
begin
fluttered
rose
we
wo
wait
declared
patricia
let
us
take
the
second
charade
first
chrissie
does
come
on
in
that
and
betty
you
go
and
ask
annie
to
take
chrissie
place
she
does
act
badly
and
there
be
time
to
tell
her
what
to
do
she
must
fetch
a
mackintosh
here
my
broad
belt
and
a
soft
felt
hat
she
can
belong
to
an
australian
regiment
annie
summoned
hastily
behind
the
scenes
rose
magnificently
to
the
occasion
coached
by
betty
and
marjorie
she
grasped
the
outline
of
the
part
she
must
play
with
immediate
comprehension
she
donned
the
mackintosh
buckled
the
belt
over
her
shoulder
cocked
the
soft
hat
over
one
eye
practised
a
military
stride
and
an
affectionate
embrace
and
declared
herself
ready
for
action
she
was
only
just
in
time
the
audience
was
already
applauding
the
end
of
the
first
charade
the
performers
came
trooping
back
flushed
and
excited
and
much
relieved
to
find
annie
so
well
prepared
you
mascot
you
saved
our
reputation
exulted
patricia
i
never
going
to
speak
to
chrissie
lang
again
declared
betty
it
abominable
of
her
to
let
us
down
like
this
agreed
rose
indignantly
charade
no
went
off
with
flying
colours
annie
really
played
up
magnificently
none
of
the
girls
had
known
before
that
she
could
act
so
well
she
threw
such
fervour
into
her
that
morrison
who
was
among
the
spectators
gave
a
warning
cough
whereupon
the
gallant
officer
released
his
lady
from
his
dramatic
embrace
and
falling
gracefully
on
one
knee
bestowed
a
theatrical
kiss
upon
her
hand
the
clapping
from
the
girl
portion
of
the
audience
was
immense
but
where
is
chrissie
lang
asked
everybody
when
the
performance
was
over
nobody
knew
since
marjorie
had
parted
from
her
in
the
dormitory
she
had
not
been
seen
neither
teachers
girls
nurses
nor
servants
could
give
any
report
of
her
she
simply
seemed
to
have
disappeared
morrison
questioned
everyone
likely
to
know
of
her
movements
but
obtained
no
satisfaction
her
cubicle
in
no
dormitory
was
unoccupied
that
night
at
breakfast
next
morning
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
was
what
has
become
of
chrissie
lang
morrison
thinks
she
must
have
run
away
and
she
telephoning
to
the
police
winifrede
told
marjorie
in
confidence
when
the
latter
anxious
to
unburden
herself
sought
the
head
girl
study
i
ca
see
that
it
your
fault
in
any
way
chrissie
was
absurd
to
show
such
temper
and
it
certainly
was
no
reason
for
going
off
i
afraid
there
must
be
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
but
what
ah
that
just
the
question
marjorie
was
very
much
upset
and
disturbed
she
could
scarcely
keep
her
attention
on
her
classes
that
morning
where
has
chrissie
gone
and
why
she
kept
asking
herself
at
there
was
still
no
news
of
the
truant
it
was
rumoured
that
morrison
had
telegraphed
to
lang
and
had
received
no
reply
the
principal
looked
anxious
and
worried
she
felt
responsible
for
the
safety
of
her
missing
pupil
early
in
the
afternoon
marjorie
wishing
to
be
alone
took
a
stroll
down
the
dingle
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
chrissie
who
had
often
sat
reading
beside
the
little
brook
marjorie
walked
to
the
very
stone
that
had
been
her
usual
seat
the
sharpenings
of
a
lead
pencil
were
still
there
and
lying
at
the
edge
of
the
water
was
a
piece
of
paper
marjorie
picked
it
up
and
smoothed
it
out
it
was
in
chrissie
writing
and
contained
a
list
of
details
in
connection
with
tanks
and
guns
also
particulars
of
the
redferne
munition
works
and
the
belgian
colony
there
and
several
other
pieces
of
information
in
connection
with
the
war
she
stared
at
it
in
consternation
a
sudden
light
began
to
break
in
upon
her
mind
good
heavens
was
it
chrissie
after
all
who
was
the
spy
she
choked
the
idea
seemed
too
horrible
it
was
she
herself
who
had
so
readily
answered
all
her
chum
questions
in
regard
to
these
things
in
doing
so
had
she
not
been
betraying
her
own
country
once
the
clue
was
given
all
sorts
of
suspicious
circumstances
came
rushing
into
her
mind
she
wondered
it
had
never
struck
her
before
to
doubt
her
patriotism
nearly
distracted
with
the
dreadful
discovery
she
hurried
away
to
find
winifrede
and
showing
her
the
paper
poured
out
her
story
winifrede
listened
aghast
i
afraid
it
only
too
true
marjorie
she
said
i
been
talking
to
morrison
and
all
sorts
of
queer
things
have
come
out
about
chrissie
it
seems
that
a
prisoner
has
escaped
last
night
from
the
german
camp
and
they
think
it
must
have
been
her
brother
and
that
she
helped
him
morrison
has
had
a
long
talk
with
a
detective
and
he
said
they
telegraphed
to
millgrove
where
chrissie
mother
lives
and
the
police
there
found
the
house
shut
up
and
discovered
that
she
is
a
german
and
that
her
true
name
is
lange
not
lang
the
detective
said
they
have
had
brackenfield
under
observation
lately
for
they
suspected
that
somebody
was
heliographing
messages
with
a
mirror
to
the
german
camp
and
who
put
that
bicycle
lamp
in
the
observatory
window
last
spring
we
have
certainly
had
a
spy
in
our
midst
we
ought
to
take
this
paper
at
once
to
morrison
and
you
must
tell
her
all
you
know
marjorie
not
only
had
a
long
talk
with
the
principal
but
was
also
forced
to
undergo
an
examination
by
the
detective
who
asked
her
a
string
of
questions
until
he
had
extorted
every
possible
detail
that
she
could
remember
there
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
was
his
verdict
there
are
plenty
of
these
spies
about
the
country
it
our
business
to
look
after
them
pity
she
got
away
so
neatly
i
afraid
she
and
her
precious
brother
must
have
had
a
boat
in
waiting
for
them
it
abominable
the
amount
of
collusion
there
is
with
the
enemy
they
accomplices
in
whitecliffe
no
doubt
if
we
could
only
get
on
the
track
of
them
i
wish
you
had
mentioned
all
this
to
me
sooner
marjorie
said
morrison
i
never
suspected
anything
returned
marjorie
bursting
into
tears
the
poor
child
was
thoroughly
unnerved
by
her
interview
with
the
detective
and
the
principal
reproach
seemed
to
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
whole
affair
in
winifrede
study
afterwards
she
sobbed
till
her
eyes
were
red
slits
never
mind
comforted
winifrede
after
all
things
might
have
been
worse
be
thankful
you
did
lend
her
your
brother
uniform
it
as
clear
as
daylight
she
did
want
it
for
charades
it
would
be
easy
for
a
german
prisoner
to
escape
disguised
as
a
british
officer
it
might
have
got
your
brother
into
most
serious
trouble
it
was
dona
who
would
let
me
take
it
choked
marjorie
she
said
at
the
time
that
she
did
trust
chrissie
i
been
a
blind
idiot
all
along
we
were
none
of
us
clever
enough
to
find
her
out
it
was
just
about
a
week
after
this
that
a
letter
arrived
at
brackenfield
addressed
to
marjorie
in
chrissie
handwriting
it
bore
a
dutch
stamp
and
postmark
and
had
been
opened
by
the
censor
morrison
perused
it
first
in
private
then
calling
marjorie
to
the
study
handed
it
to
her
to
read
it
bore
no
address
or
date
and
ran
thus
my
dear
marjorie
this
letter
is
to
say
a
last
to
you
for
you
will
never
hear
from
me
or
of
me
again
by
now
you
will
have
found
out
all
believe
me
that
what
i
did
was
not
by
my
own
wish
i
hated
and
loathed
it
all
the
time
but
i
was
forced
by
others
to
do
it
i
can
not
tell
you
how
wretched
i
was
and
how
i
envied
you
who
had
no
dreadful
secret
to
keep
we
are
going
back
to
our
own
people
here
a
portion
of
the
letter
was
blackened
by
the
censor
it
was
all
for
his
sake
again
a
portion
was
erased
i
want
to
tell
you
marjorie
how
i
have
loved
you
you
have
been
the
one
bright
spot
in
my
life
and
i
can
never
forget
your
kindness
i
have
your
portrait
inside
my
locket
and
i
shall
wear
it
always
and
have
it
buried
with
me
in
my
coffin
try
to
think
of
me
as
if
i
were
already
dead
and
forgive
me
if
you
can
from
your
still
loving
friend
chrissie
marjorie
put
down
the
letter
with
a
shaking
hand
is
it
right
to
forgive
the
enemies
of
our
country
she
asked
morrison
when
they
are
dead
replied
the
principal
marjorie
went
out
slowly
from
the
study
and
stood
thinking
for
a
moment
then
going
upstairs
to
her
cubicle
she
looked
in
her
treasure
box
and
found
the
little
gold
locket
containing
the
portrait
of
her
friend
it
had
been
a
birthday
present
from
chrissie
she
refrained
from
opening
it
but
taking
it
down
to
the
dingle
she
flung
it
into
the
deepest
pool
in
the
brook
she
walked
back
up
the
field
with
a
feeling
as
though
she
had
attended
a
funeral
dona
met
her
in
the
quadrangle
i
just
seen
miss
norton
she
confided
the
specialist
came
to
look
at
eric
yesterday
and
he
gives
quite
good
hopes
for
him
he
to
go
into
a
children
hospital
under
a
very
clever
doctor
and
be
properly
looked
after
and
dieted
his
own
mother
lets
him
eat
anything
simply
beaming
she
to
take
him
herself
next
week
in
a
motor
ambulance
marjorie
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
have
brightened
bygones
must
remain
bygones
she
had
been
imprudent
indeed
in
supplying
information
but
it
had
been
done
in
all
innocence
and
though
she
might
blame
her
own
folly
she
could
not
condemn
her
act
as
unpatriotic
there
good
news
from
the
front
too
continued
dona
another
ridge
taken
and
a
village
winifrede
showed
me
the
newspaper
lieutenant
preston
name
is
mentioned
for
conspicuous
bravery
it
really
quite
an
important
victory
on
our
part
we
driven

i
