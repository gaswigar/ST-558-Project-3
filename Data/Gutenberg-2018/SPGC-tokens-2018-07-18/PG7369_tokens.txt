chapter
i
my
first
journey
i
was
born
in
the
year
in
the
town
of
in
gloucestershire
i
am
sure
of
the
year
because
my
father
always
told
me
that
i
was
born
at
the
end
of
the
century
in
the
year
that
they
began
to
build
the
great
house
the
house
has
been
finished
now
these
many
years
the
wall
which
shuts
its
garden
from
the
road
and
the
severn
is
all
covered
with
valerian
and
creeping
plants
one
of
my
earliest
memories
is
of
the
masons
at
work
shaping
the
two
great
bows
i
remember
how
my
nurse
used
to
stop
to
watch
them
at
the
corner
of
the
road
on
the
green
strip
by
the
where
the
gipsies
camped
on
the
way
to
gloucester
one
of
the
masons
was
her
sweetheart
tom
farrell
his
name
was
but
he
got
into
bad
ways
i
remember
and
was
hanged
or
transported
though
that
was
years
afterwards
when
i
had
left
that
countryside
my
father
and
mother
died
when
i
was
still
a
boy
my
mother
on
the
day
of
trafalgar
battle
in
my
father
four
years
later
it
was
very
sad
at
home
after
mother
died
my
father
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
never
seeing
anybody
when
my
father
died
my
uncle
came
to
newnham
from
his
home
in
devonshire
my
old
home
was
sold
then
and
i
was
taken
away
i
remember
the
day
so
very
clearly
it
was
one
sunny
morning
in
early
april
my
uncle
and
i
caught
the
coach
at
the
top
of
the
hill
at
the
door
of
the
old
inn
opposite
the
church
the
coachman
had
a
hot
drink
handed
up
to
him
and
the
ostlers
hitched
up
the
new
team
then
the
guard
he
had
a
red
coat
like
a
soldier
blew
his
horn
and
the
coach
started
off
down
the
hill
going
so
very
fast
that
i
was
afraid
for
i
had
never
ridden
on
a
coach
before
though
i
had
seen
them
every
day
the
last
that
i
saw
of
newnham
was
the
great
house
at
the
corner
it
was
finished
by
that
time
of
course
and
as
we
drove
past
i
saw
the
beautiful
woman
who
lived
there
walking
up
and
down
the
lawn
with
her
husband
captain
rylands
a
very
tall
handsome
man
who
used
to
give
me
apples
i
was
always
afraid
to
eat
the
apples
because
my
nurse
said
that
the
captain
had
killed
a
man
that
was
in
the
wars
in
spain
fighting
against
the
french
i
remember
a
great
deal
about
my
first
we
slept
that
night
at
bristol
in
one
of
the
famous
coaching
inns
where
as
a
great
treat
i
had
bacon
and
eggs
for
supper
instead
of
in
the
morning
my
uncle
took
me
with
him
to
the
docks
where
he
had
some
business
to
do
that
was
the
first
time
i
ever
really
saw
big
ships
and
that
was
the
first
time
i
spoke
with
the
sailors
there
was
a
capstan
on
one
of
the
wharves
and
men
were
at
work
heaving
round
it
hoisting
casks
out
of
a
west
indiaman
one
of
the
men
said
come
on
young
master
give
us
a
hand
on
the
bar
here
so
i
put
my
hands
on
to
the
bar
and
pushed
my
best
walking
beside
him
till
my
uncle
called
me
away
there
were
many
ships
there
at
the
time
all
a
west
indian
convoy
and
it
was
fine
to
see
their
great
figureheads
and
the
brass
cannon
at
the
ports
and
to
hear
the
men
singing
out
aloft
as
they
shifted
spars
and
bent
and
unbent
sails
they
were
all
very
lofty
ships
built
for
speed
all
were
beautifully
kept
like
and
all
of
them
had
their
and
red
ensigns
flying
so
that
in
the
sun
they
looked
splendid
i
shall
never
forget
them
after
that
we
went
back
to
the
inn
and
climbed
into
another
coach
and
drove
for
a
long
long
time
often
very
slowly
till
we
reached
a
place
near
newton
abbot
where
there
was
a
kind
woman
who
put
me
to
bed
i
was
too
tired
to
notice
more
then
the
next
morning
i
remember
a
strange
man
who
was
very
cross
at
breakfast
so
that
the
kind
woman
cried
till
my
uncle
sent
me
out
of
the
room
it
is
funny
how
these
things
came
back
to
me
it
might
have
been
only
yesterday
late
that
afternoon
we
reached
the
south
coast
of
devon
so
that
we
had
the
sea
close
beside
us
until
the
sun
set
i
heard
the
sea
as
i
thought
when
we
reached
my
uncle
house
at
the
end
of
the
twilight
but
they
told
me
that
it
was
a
brawling
over
its
boulders
and
that
the
sea
was
a
full
mile
away
my
aunt
helped
to
put
me
to
bed
but
i
was
too
much
excited
to
sleep
well
i
lay
awake
for
a
long
long
time
listening
to
the
noise
of
the
brook
and
to
the
wind
among
the
trees
outside
and
to
the
cuckoo
clock
on
the
landing
calling
out
the
hours
and
when
i
fell
asleep
i
seemed
to
hear
the
sea
and
the
crying
out
of
the
sailors
voices
seemed
to
be
talking
close
beside
me
in
the
room
i
seemed
to
hear
all
sorts
of
things
strange
things
which
afterwards
really
happened
there
was
a
burning
on
the
whenever
i
woke
up
in
the
night
the
light
would
show
me
the
shadow
of
the
water
jug
upon
the
ceiling
it
looked
like
an
old
old
man
with
a
humped
back
walking
the
road
bowed
over
his
cudgel
i
am
not
going
to
say
very
much
about
my
life
during
the
next
few
years
my
aunt
and
uncle
had
no
children
of
their
own
and
no
great
fondness
for
the
children
of
others
sometimes
i
was
very
lonely
there
but
after
my
tenth
birthday
i
was
at
school
most
of
my
time
at
newton
abbot
i
used
to
spend
my
easter
holidays
never
more
than
a
week
with
the
kind
woman
who
put
me
to
bed
that
night
of
my
journey
my
summer
and
winter
holidays
i
spent
with
my
uncle
and
aunt
in
their
little
house
above
the
the
rose
about
three
miles
from
my
uncle
house
in
a
boggy
wood
full
of
springs
it
was
a
very
rapid
brook
nowhere
more
than
three
or
four
feet
deep
and
never
more
than
twenty
feet
across
even
near
its
mouth
below
my
uncle
house
it
was
full
of
little
falls
with
great
mossy
boulders
which
checked
its
flow
and
pools
where
the
bubbles
spun
further
down
its
course
was
gentler
for
the
last
mile
to
the
sea
was
a
flat
valley
with
combes
on
each
side
covered
with
gorse
and
bramble
the
sea
had
once
come
right
up
that
valley
to
just
below
my
uncle
house
but
that
was
many
years
before
long
before
anybody
could
remember
just
after
i
went
to
live
there
one
of
the
farmers
dug
a
drain
or
rhine
in
the
valley
to
clear
a
boggy
patch
he
dug
up
the
wreck
of
a
large
with
her
anchor
and
a
few
rusty
hoops
lying
beside
her
under
the
ooze
about
a
foot
below
the
surface
she
must
have
sailed
right
up
from
the
sea
hundreds
of
years
ago
before
the
brook
mouth
got
blocked
with
shingle
as
i
suppose
it
was
during
some
summer
gale
when
the
stream
was
nearly
dry
often
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
imagine
the
ships
coming
up
from
the
sea
along
that
valley
firing
their
cannon
in
the
winter
when
the
snow
melted
the
valley
would
be
flooded
till
it
looked
just
like
a
sea
and
then
i
would
imagine
there
with
pirates
in
red
caps
boarding
spanish
treasure
galleons
the
seacoast
is
mostly
very
bold
in
that
part
of
devon
even
where
there
are
no
cliffs
the
land
rises
steeply
from
the
sea
in
grassy
hills
with
boulders
and
broken
rock
instead
of
a
beach
below
them
there
are
small
sandy
beaches
wherever
the
brooks
run
into
the
sea
everywhere
else
the
shore
is
so
much
so
that
in
many
places
it
is
very
difficult
to
reach
the
sea
i
mention
this
because
later
on
that
steep
coast
gave
me
some
queer
adventures
chapter
ii
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
something
very
terrible
happened
with
good
results
for
myself
the
woman
near
newton
abbot
i
have
spoken
of
her
several
times
was
a
mrs
cottier
the
wife
of
a
schoolmaster
her
husband
used
to
drink
very
hard
and
in
this
particular
year
he
was
turned
out
of
the
school
and
lost
his
living
his
wife
left
him
then
or
rather
he
left
her
for
a
long
time
no
one
knew
what
became
of
him
and
came
to
live
with
us
bringing
with
her
little
hugh
cottier
her
son
a
boy
of
about
my
own
age
after
that
life
in
my
house
was
a
different
thing
to
me
mrs
cottier
was
very
beautiful
and
kind
she
was
like
my
mother
strangely
like
always
sweet
and
gentle
always
helpful
and
wise
i
think
she
was
the
dearest
woman
who
ever
lived
i
was
always
proud
when
she
asked
me
to
do
something
for
her
once
i
remember
in
the
winter
after
mrs
cottier
came
to
us
she
drove
to
salcombe
to
do
her
christmas
shopping
it
came
on
to
snow
during
the
afternoon
and
at
the
storm
grew
worse
we
put
back
supper
expecting
her
to
come
in
at
any
minute
but
she
did
not
come
the
hours
went
by
and
still
she
did
not
come
and
still
the
storm
worsened
the
wind
was
not
very
high
but
the
air
was
full
of
a
fine
powdery
drifting
snow
the
night
seemed
full
of
snow
snow
fell
down
the
chimney
and
drifted
in
under
the
door
my
uncle
was
too
lame
with
sciatica
to
leave
his
bed
and
my
aunt
always
a
woman
of
poor
spirit
was
afraid
of
the
night
at
eight
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
so
i
said
that
i
would
saddle
the
pony
and
ride
out
along
the
salcombe
road
to
find
her
hugh
was
for
going
in
my
place
but
hugh
was
not
so
strongly
built
as
i
and
i
felt
that
hugh
would
faint
after
an
hour
in
the
cold
i
put
on
double
clothes
with
an
oilskin
jacket
over
all
and
then
lit
the
lantern
and
beat
out
of
the
house
to
the
stable
i
put
one
or
two
extra
candles
in
my
pockets
with
a
flint
and
steel
and
some
bread
and
meat
something
prompted
me
to
take
a
hank
of
cord
and
a
heavy
old
and
with
all
these
things
upon
him
old
greylegs
the
pony
was
when
we
got
into
the
road
together
i
could
not
see
a
yard
in
front
of
me
there
was
nothing
but
darkness
and
drifting
snow
and
the
gleam
of
the
drifts
where
the
light
of
the
lantern
fell
there
was
no
question
of
losing
the
road
for
the
road
was
a
devon
lane
narrow
and
deep
built
by
the
ancient
britons
so
everybody
says
to
give
them
protection
as
they
went
down
to
the
brooks
for
water
if
it
had
been
an
open
road
i
could
never
have
found
my
way
for
fifty
yards
i
was
strongly
built
for
a
boy
even
at
sea
i
never
suffered
much
from
the
cold
and
this
night
was
not
intensely
cold
snowy
weather
seldom
is
what
made
the
ride
so
exhausting
was
the
beating
of
the
snow
into
my
eyes
and
mouth
it
fell
upon
me
in
a
continual
dry
feathery
pelting
till
i
was
confused
and
tired
out
with
the
effort
of
trying
to
see
ahead
for
a
little
while
i
had
the
roar
of
the
in
my
ears
to
comfort
me
but
when
i
topped
the
next
combe
that
died
away
and
there
i
was
in
the
night
beating
on
against
the
storm
with
the
strange
moaning
sound
of
the
wind
from
dartmoor
and
the
snow
rustling
to
keep
me
company
i
was
not
exactly
afraid
for
the
snow
in
my
face
bothered
me
too
much
but
often
the
night
would
seem
full
of
people
laughing
horrible
people
and
often
i
would
think
that
i
saw
mrs
cottier
lying
in
a
drift
i
rode
three
miles
or
more
without
seeing
anybody
then
just
before
i
reached
the
moor
in
a
lull
when
the
snow
was
not
so
bad
i
heard
a
horse
whinny
and
old
greylegs
baulked
then
i
heard
voices
and
a
noise
as
of
people
riding
and
before
i
could
start
old
greylegs
i
saw
a
party
of
horsemen
crossing
my
road
by
the
road
from
the
sea
to
dartmoor
they
were
riding
at
a
quick
trot
and
though
there
were
many
horses
some
thirty
or
forty
i
could
see
even
in
that
light
that
most
of
them
were
led
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
men
and
only
one
of
all
that
dozen
carried
a
lantern
something
told
me
that
they
were
out
for
no
good
and
the
same
instinct
made
me
cover
my
lantern
with
my
coat
so
that
they
passed
me
without
seeing
me
at
first
i
thought
that
they
were
the
fairy
troop
and
that
gave
me
an
awful
fear
but
a
moment
later
in
the
wind
i
felt
a
whiff
of
tobacco
and
of
a
strong
warm
sweet
smell
of
spirits
and
i
knew
then
that
they
were
the
or
smugglers
after
they
had
gone
i
forced
old
greylegs
forward
and
trotted
on
against
the
snow
for
another
with
my
heart
going
thump
upon
my
ribs
i
had
an
awful
fear
that
they
would
turn
and
catch
me
and
i
knew
that
the
wanted
no
witnesses
of
their
adventures
in
the
dark
about
four
miles
from
home
i
came
to
an
open
part
of
the
road
where
the
snow
came
down
in
its
full
fury
there
being
no
hedge
to
give
a
little
shelter
it
was
so
thick
that
i
could
not
get
greylegs
to
go
on
he
stood
and
cowered
though
i
beat
him
with
my
hank
of
cord
and
kicked
his
ribs
it
was
cruel
of
me
but
i
thought
of
mrs
cottier
with
her
beautiful
kind
face
lying
in
a
drift
of
snow
and
the
thought
was
dreadful
to
me
i
got
down
from
the
saddle
and
put
my
lantern
on
the
ground
and
tried
to
drag
him
forward
but
it
was
useless
he
would
not
have
stirred
if
i
had
lighted
a
fire
under
him
when
he
had
the
instinct
to
stand
still
nothing
would
make
him
budge
a
yard
a
very
fierce
gust
came
upon
me
then
the
snow
seemed
to
whirl
upon
me
from
all
sides
so
that
i
got
giddy
and
sick
and
then
just
at
the
moment
there
were
horses
and
voices
all
about
me
coming
from
salcombe
way
somebody
called
out
hullo
and
somebody
called
out
look
out
behind
and
then
a
lot
of
horses
pulled
up
suddenly
and
some
men
spoke
and
a
led
horse
shied
at
my
lantern
i
had
no
time
to
think
or
to
run
i
felt
myself
backing
into
old
greylegs
in
sheer
fright
and
then
some
one
thrust
a
lantern
into
my
face
and
asked
me
who
i
was
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
i
saw
that
he
wore
a
skirt
over
his
trousers
and
his
face
was
covered
by
one
of
those
great
straw
pierced
with
holes
for
his
eyes
and
mouth
he
was
one
of
the
most
terrible
things
i
have
ever
seen
why
it
a
boy
said
the
terrible
man
what
are
you
doing
here
boy
another
man
who
seemed
to
be
a
leader
called
out
from
his
horse
who
are
you
but
i
was
too
scared
to
answer
my
teeth
were
rattling
in
my
head
it
a
trick
said
another
voice
we
had
best
go
for
the
moor
shut
up
said
the
leader
sharply
the
boy
scared
he
got
down
from
his
horse
and
peered
at
me
by
the
lantern
light
he
too
wore
a
in
fact
they
all
did
for
there
is
no
better
disguise
in
the
world
while
nothing
makes
a
man
look
more
horrible
i
was
not
quite
so
terrified
by
this
time
because
he
had
spoken
kindly
who
are
you
he
asked
we
sha
eat
you
what
are
you
doing
here
as
well
as
i
could
i
told
him
the
leader
strode
off
a
few
paces
and
spoke
with
one
or
two
other
men
but
i
could
only
catch
the
words
yes
yes
captain
spoken
in
a
low
quick
voice
which
seemed
somehow
familiar
then
he
came
back
to
me
and
took
me
by
the
throat
and
swayed
me
to
and
fro
very
gently
but
in
a
way
which
made
me
feel
that
i
was
going
to
be
killed
tell
me
he
said
i
shall
know
whether
you
lying
so
tell
the
truth
now
what
have
you
seen
i
told
him
that
i
had
seen
a
troop
of
horsemen
going
through
the
snow
towards
the
moor
that
settles
it
captain
said
another
voice
you
ca
trust
a
young
chap
like
that
shut
up
said
the
man
they
called
captain
i
master
not
you
he
strode
off
again
to
speak
to
another
man
i
heard
some
one
laugh
a
little
and
then
the
captain
came
back
to
me
he
took
me
by
the
throat
as
before
and
again
shook
me
you
listen
to
me
he
said
grimly
if
you
breathe
so
much
as
one
word
of
what
you
seen
well
i
shall
know
d
hear
i
shall
know
and
when
i
know
well
your
little
neck
go
there
poetry
that
will
help
you
remember
i
know
your
neck
go
like
so
he
gave
a
sharp
little
twist
of
his
hand
upon
my
adam
apple
i
was
terrified
i
do
know
what
i
said
my
tongue
seemed
to
wither
on
its
stalk
the
captain
walked
to
his
horse
and
remounted
come
along
boys
he
said
the
line
of
horses
started
off
again
a
hand
fell
upon
my
shoulder
and
a
voice
spoke
kindly
to
me
see
here
it
said
you
go
on
another
you
find
a
barn
by
the
side
of
the
road
there
no
door
on
the
barn
and
you
see
a
fire
inside
you
find
your
lady
there
she
is
safe
all
right
you
keep
your
tongue
shut
now
the
speaker
climbed
into
his
saddle
and
trotted
off
into
the
night
half
a
mile
straight
ahead
he
called
then
the
dull
trampling
died
away
and
i
was
left
alone
again
with
greylegs
some
minutes
passed
before
i
could
mount
for
i
was
stiff
with
fright
i
was
too
frightened
after
that
to
mind
the
snow
i
was
almost
too
frightened
to
ride
luckily
for
me
the
coming
of
the
had
startled
old
greylegs
also
he
trotted
on
gallantly
though
sometimes
he
floundered
into
a
drift
and
had
to
be
helped
out
before
i
came
to
the
barn
the
snow
stopped
falling
except
for
a
few
aimless
flakes
which
drifted
from
all
sides
in
the
air
it
was
very
dark
still
the
sky
was
like
ink
but
there
was
a
feel
of
freshness
i
can
not
describe
it
which
told
me
that
the
wind
had
changed
presently
i
saw
the
barn
ahead
of
me
to
the
right
of
the
road
spreading
a
red
glow
of
fire
across
the
way
old
greylegs
seemed
glad
of
the
sight
he
gave
a
whinny
and
snorted
as
well
as
he
could
he
broke
into
a
canter
and
carried
me
up
to
the
door
in
style
are
you
safe
mrs
cottier
i
called
out
what
jim
she
answered
how
good
of
you
to
come
for
me
the
barn
unlike
most
barns
in
that
country
was
of
only
one
story
it
may
have
been
a
farmhouse
in
the
long
ago
for
it
had
larger
windows
than
most
barns
these
had
been
stuffed
with
sacks
and
straw
to
keep
out
the
weather
the
door
had
been
torn
from
its
place
by
some
one
in
need
of
firewood
the
roof
was
fairly
sound
the
floor
was
of
trampled
earth
well
away
from
the
doorway
in
the
centre
of
the
barn
some
one
had
lighted
a
fire
using
as
fuel
one
of
the
faggots
stacked
against
the
wall
the
smoke
had
long
since
blown
out
of
doors
the
air
in
the
barn
was
clear
and
fresh
the
fire
had
died
down
to
a
ruddy
heap
of
embers
which
glowed
and
grew
grey
again
as
the
draughts
fanned
them
from
the
doorway
by
the
light
of
the
fire
i
could
see
mrs
cottier
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
back
against
the
wheel
of
her
trap
which
had
been
dragged
inside
to
be
out
of
the
snow
i
hitched
old
greylegs
to
one
of
the
iron
bolts
which
had
once
held
a
and
ran
to
her
to
make
sure
that
she
was
unhurt
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
here
i
asked
are
you
sure
you
not
hurt
she
laughed
a
little
at
this
and
i
got
out
my
stores
and
we
made
our
supper
by
the
fire
where
old
nigger
i
asked
her
for
i
was
puzzled
by
seeing
no
horse
oh
jim
she
said
i
had
such
adventures
when
she
had
eaten
a
little
she
told
me
her
story
i
was
coming
home
from
salcombe
she
said
and
i
was
driving
fast
so
as
to
get
home
before
the
snow
lay
deep
just
outside
south
pool
nigger
cast
a
shoe
and
i
was
kept
waiting
at
the
forge
for
nearly
half
an
hour
after
that
the
snow
was
so
bad
that
i
could
not
get
along
it
grew
dark
when
i
was
only
a
mile
or
two
from
the
blacksmith
and
i
began
to
fear
that
i
should
never
get
home
however
as
i
drove
through
stokenham
the
weather
seemed
to
clear
a
little
so
i
hurried
nigger
all
i
could
hoping
to
get
home
in
the
lull
when
i
got
to
within
a
hundred
yards
from
here
in
the
little
hollow
where
the
stunted
ashes
are
i
found
myself
among
a
troop
of
horsemen
who
stopped
me
and
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
they
were
all
disguised
and
they
had
lanterns
among
them
and
i
could
see
that
the
horses
carried
tubs
i
suppose
full
of
smuggled
lace
and
brandy
and
tobacco
ready
to
be
carried
inland
jim
dear
i
was
horribly
frightened
for
while
they
were
speaking
together
i
thought
i
heard
the
voice
of
of
some
one
i
know
or
used
to
know
she
stopped
for
a
moment
overcome
and
i
knew
at
once
that
she
was
speaking
of
her
husband
the
schoolmaster
that
was
and
then
she
continued
some
of
them
told
me
to
get
down
out
of
the
trap
and
then
another
of
them
seized
nigger
head
and
walked
the
trap
as
far
as
the
barn
here
then
they
unharnessed
nigger
and
led
him
away
saying
they
were
short
of
horses
but
would
send
him
back
in
a
day
or
two
they
seemed
to
know
all
about
me
where
i
lived
and
everything
one
of
them
took
a
faggot
from
a
wall
here
and
laid
the
big
fire
with
straw
instead
of
paper
while
he
lit
it
he
kept
his
great
on
his
head
they
all
wore
them
but
i
noticed
he
had
three
blue
rings
tattooed
on
his
left
now
somewhere
i
have
seen
a
man
quite
recently
with
rings
tattooed
like
that
only
i
ca
remember
where
i
wish
i
could
think
where
he
was
very
civil
and
gentle
he
saw
that
the
fire
burnt
up
well
and
left
me
all
those
sticks
and
logs
as
well
as
the
flint
and
steel
in
case
it
should
go
out
before
the
snow
stopped
oh
and
he
took
the
rugs
out
of
the
trap
and
laid
them
on
the
ground
for
me
to
sit
on
before
he
left
he
said
very
civilly
i
am
sure
you
do
want
to
get
folks
into
trouble
madam
perhaps
you
wo
mention
this
in
case
they
ask
you
so
i
said
that
i
did
want
to
get
people
into
trouble
but
that
it
was
hardly
a
manly
act
to
leave
a
woman
alone
in
an
open
barn
miles
from
anywhere
on
a
night
like
he
seemed
ashamed
at
this
for
he
slunk
off
saying
something
about
obeying
orders
and
having
much
choice
in
the
matter
then
they
all
stood
about
outside
in
the
snow
leaving
me
alone
here
they
must
have
stayed
outside
a
couple
of
hours
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
you
came
i
heard
some
one
call
out
it
is
boys
and
immediately
they
all
trotted
off
at
a
smart
pace
they
must
have
seen
or
heard
some
signal
of
course
up
here
on
the
top
of
the
combe
one
could
see
a
long
way
if
the
snow
lulled
for
a
moment
chapter
iii
the
man
on
the
mound
it
was
very
awesome
sitting
there
by
the
firelight
in
the
lonely
barn
hearing
the
strange
moan
of
the
when
mrs
cottier
finished
her
story
we
talked
of
all
sorts
of
things
i
think
that
we
were
both
a
little
afraid
of
being
silent
in
such
a
place
so
as
we
ate
we
kept
talking
just
as
though
we
were
by
the
fireside
at
home
i
was
afraid
that
perhaps
the
revenue
officers
would
catch
us
there
and
force
us
to
tell
all
we
knew
and
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
when
i
remembered
the
captain
in
the
who
had
shaken
my
throat
and
given
me
such
a
warning
to
be
silent
when
we
had
finished
our
supper
i
told
mrs
cottier
that
perhaps
we
could
harness
old
greylegs
to
the
trap
but
this
she
thought
would
never
do
as
the
drifts
on
the
road
made
it
such
bad
going
at
last
i
persuaded
her
to
mount
old
greylegs
and
to
ride
astride
like
a
boy
or
like
so
many
of
the
countrywomen
in
our
parts
when
she
had
mounted
i
took
the
old
pony
by
the
head
and
led
him
out
carrying
the
lantern
in
my
hand
when
we
got
outside
we
found
to
our
great
surprise
that
the
sky
had
cleared
it
was
a
night
of
stars
now
that
the
wind
had
changed
by
the
blink
of
the
snow
our
road
was
quite
plain
to
us
and
the
sharp
touch
of
frost
in
the
air
which
we
felt
all
the
more
after
our
bonfire
in
the
barn
had
already
made
the
snow
crisp
underfoot
it
was
pleasant
to
be
travelling
like
that
so
late
at
night
with
mrs
cottier
i
felt
like
a
knight
who
had
just
rescued
a
princess
from
a
dragon
we
talked
together
as
we
had
never
talked
before
whenever
we
climbed
a
bad
combe
she
dismounted
and
we
walked
together
hand
in
hand
like
dear
friends
once
or
twice
in
the
quiet
i
thought
i
heard
the
noise
of
the
excisemen
horses
and
then
my
heart
thumped
in
my
throat
then
when
i
knew
myself
mistaken
i
felt
only
the
delight
of
being
of
service
to
this
dear
woman
who
walked
by
me
so
merrily
when
we
came
to
the
foot
of
the
combe
to
the
bridge
over
the
she
stopped
for
a
moment
jim
she
said
drawing
me
to
her
i
shall
never
forget
nor
the
little
friend
who
rode
out
to
help
me
i
want
you
after
this
always
to
look
on
me
as
your
mother
i
knew
your
mother
a
little
years
ago
well
dear
try
to
think
of
me
as
you
would
of
her
and
be
a
brother
to
my
hugh
jim
let
us
all
three
be
one
family
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
my
cheek
and
lips
i
will
mrs
cottier
i
said
i
always
be
a
brother
to
hugh
i
was
too
deeply
moved
to
say
much
more
for
i
had
so
long
yearned
for
some
woman
like
my
mother
to
whom
i
could
go
for
sympathy
and
to
whom
i
could
tell
everything
without
the
fear
of
being
snubbed
or
laughed
at
i
just
said
thank
you
mims
i
do
know
why
i
called
her
mims
then
but
i
did
and
afterwards
i
never
called
her
anything
else
that
was
my
secret
name
for
her
she
kissed
me
again
and
stroked
my
cheek
with
her
hand
and
we
went
on
again
together
up
the
last
steep
bit
of
road
to
the
house
always
after
that
i
never
thought
of
mrs
cottier
without
feeling
her
lips
upon
my
cheek
and
hearing
the
stamp
of
old
greylegs
as
he
pawed
on
the
snow
eager
for
the
stable
just
round
the
corner
it
was
very
nice
to
get
round
the
corner
and
to
see
the
lights
of
the
house
a
little
way
in
front
of
us
in
a
minute
or
two
we
were
there
mrs
cottier
had
been
dragged
in
to
the
fire
to
all
sorts
of
comforting
drinks
and
exclamations
and
old
greylegs
was
snug
in
his
stable
having
his
coat
rubbed
down
before
going
to
sleep
under
his
rug
we
were
all
glad
to
get
to
bed
that
night
hugh
and
my
aunt
were
tired
with
anxiety
and
mrs
cottier
and
i
had
had
enough
adventure
to
make
us
very
thankful
for
rest
before
we
parted
for
the
night
she
drew
me
to
one
side
and
told
me
that
she
had
not
mentioned
the
to
my
uncle
and
aunt
while
i
was
busy
in
the
stable
and
that
it
might
be
safer
if
i
too
kept
quiet
about
them
i
do
not
know
how
she
explained
the
absence
of
nigger
but
i
am
sure
they
were
all
too
thankful
to
have
her
safely
home
again
to
bother
much
about
the
details
of
her
drive
hugh
and
i
always
slept
in
soldier
in
a
little
room
looking
out
over
the
lane
during
the
night
we
heard
voices
and
footsteps
moving
in
the
lane
beneath
us
and
our
dog
always
kennelled
at
the
back
of
the
house
barked
a
good
deal
hugh
and
i
crept
from
our
bed
and
peered
through
the
window
but
it
opened
the
wrong
way
we
could
only
look
down
the
lane
whereas
the
noise
seemed
to
come
from
just
above
us
near
the
stable
door
unluckily
the
frost
had
covered
the
window
with
so
that
we
could
not
see
through
the
glass
we
were
however
quite
certain
that
there
were
people
with
lights
close
to
our
stable
door
we
thought
at
first
that
we
had
better
call
mrs
cottier
and
then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
these
were
the
come
to
return
nigger
so
i
told
hugh
to
go
back
to
bed
and
forget
about
it
i
waited
at
the
window
for
a
few
moments
wondering
if
the
men
would
pass
the
house
i
felt
a
horrible
longing
to
see
those
huge
and
ghastly
things
in
skirts
and
striding
across
the
snow
going
home
from
their
night
prowl
like
skulking
foxes
but
whoever
they
were
they
took
no
risks
some
one
softly
whistled
a
scrap
of
a
tune
tom
tom
the
piper
son
as
though
he
were
pleased
at
having
finished
a
good
piece
of
work
and
then
i
heard
footsteps
going
over
the
gap
in
the
hedge
and
the
crackling
of
twigs
in
the
little
wood
on
the
other
side
of
the
lane
i
went
back
to
bed
and
slept
like
a
top
until
nearly
breakfast
time
i
went
out
to
the
stable
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
to
find
joe
barnicoat
our
man
busy
at
his
morning
work
he
had
already
swept
away
the
snow
from
the
doors
of
the
house
and
stable
so
that
i
could
not
see
what
footmarks
had
been
made
there
since
i
went
to
fetch
greylegs
at
eight
the
night
before
joe
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
for
during
the
night
the
stable
had
been
broken
open
i
had
left
it
locked
up
as
it
always
was
locked
after
i
had
made
greylegs
comfortable
when
joe
came
there
at
about
seven
he
had
found
the
broken
padlock
lying
in
the
snow
and
the
secured
by
a
wooden
peg
cut
from
an
ash
in
the
hedge
as
i
expected
nigger
was
in
his
stall
but
the
poor
horse
was
dead
lame
from
a
cut
in
the
fetlock
joe
said
he
must
have
been
kicked
there
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
trap
also
had
come
home
there
it
was
in
its
place
with
the
snow
still
unmelted
on
its
wheels
i
helped
joe
to
dress
poor
nigger
leg
saying
that
it
was
a
pity
we
had
not
noticed
it
before
joe
was
grumbling
about
some
people
not
having
enough
sense
to
know
when
a
horse
was
lame
so
i
let
him
grumble
when
we
had
dressed
the
wound
i
turned
to
the
trap
to
lift
out
mrs
cottier
parcels
which
i
carried
indoors
breakfast
was
ready
on
the
table
and
mrs
cottier
and
hugh
were
toasting
some
bread
at
the
fire
my
aunt
was
of
course
breakfasting
upstairs
with
my
uncle
he
was
hardly
able
to
stir
with
sciatica
poor
man
he
needed
somebody
to
feed
him
good
morning
mims
dear
i
cried
what
do
you
think
the
come
back
and
here
are
all
your
parcels
i
noticed
then
i
had
not
noticed
it
before
that
one
of
the
parcels
was
very
curiously
wrapped
it
was
wrapped
in
an
old
sack
probably
one
of
those
which
filled
the
windows
of
the
barn
for
bits
of
straw
still
stuck
in
the
threads
whatever
have
you
got
there
jim
said
mrs
cottier
one
of
your
parcels
i
answered
i
just
taken
it
out
of
the
trap
let
me
see
it
she
said
there
must
be
some
mistake
that
not
one
of
mine
she
took
the
parcel
from
me
and
turned
it
over
before
opening
it
on
turning
the
package
over
we
saw
that
some
one
had
twisted
a
piece
of
dirty
grey
paper
evidently
from
the
grocer
shop
about
the
rope
yarn
which
kept
the
roll
secure
mrs
cottier
noticed
it
first
oh
she
cried
there
a
letter
too
i
wonder
if
it
meant
for
me
we
untied
the
rope
yarn
and
the
paper
fell
upon
the
table
we
opened
it
out
wondering
what
message
could
be
written
on
it
it
was
a
part
of
a
grocer
sugar
bag
written
upon
in
the
coarse
black
crayon
used
by
the
tallymen
on
the
quays
at
kingsbridge
the
writing
was
disguised
so
as
to
give
no
clue
to
the
writer
the
letters
were
printer
capitals
the
words
were
and
the
whole
had
probably
been
written
in
a
hurry
perhaps
by
the
light
of
our
fire
in
the
barn
hors
is
laimd
said
the
curious
letter
regret
inconvenuns
axept
respect
from
obt
servt
captin
sharp
very
sweet
and
to
the
point
said
mrs
cottier
is
nigger
lame
then
yes
i
answered
joe
says
he
has
been
kicked
you
wo
be
able
to
drive
him
for
some
time
poor
old
nigger
said
mrs
cottier
as
she
unwrapped
the
parcel
now
i
wonder
what
captain
sharp
has
sent
me
she
unrolled
the
sacking
and
out
fell
two
of
those
straw
cases
which
are
used
to
protect
they
seemed
unusually
bulky
so
we
tore
them
open
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
roll
covered
with
a
bit
of
tarpaulin
it
contained
a
dozen
yards
of
very
beautiful
malines
lace
the
other
case
was
full
of
silk
neckerchiefs
packed
very
tightly
eleven
altogether
most
of
them
of
uncoloured
silk
but
one
of
green
and
another
of
blue
worth
a
lot
of
money
in
those
days
and
perhaps
worth
more
now
that
such
fine
silk
is
no
longer
woven
so
this
is
what
we
get
for
the
loan
of
nigger
jim
said
mrs
cottier
we
ought
by
rights
to
give
these
things
to
the
revenue
officer
yes
i
said
but
if
we
do
that
we
shall
have
to
say
how
they
came
and
why
they
came
and
then
perhaps
the
exciseman
will
get
a
clue
and
we
shall
have
brought
the
into
trouble
it
was
cowardly
of
me
to
speak
like
this
but
you
must
remember
that
i
had
been
in
captain
sharp
hands
the
night
before
and
i
was
still
terrified
by
his
threat
when
i
know
your
neck
go
like
so
well
said
mrs
cottier
looking
at
me
rather
sharply
we
will
keep
the
things
and
say
nothing
about
them
but
we
must
find
out
what
duty
should
be
paid
on
them
and
send
it
to
the
exciseman
at
dartmouth
that
will
spare
our
consciences
after
breakfast
mrs
cottier
went
to
give
orders
to
the
servant
while
hugh
and
i
slipped
down
the
lane
to
see
how
the
snow
had
drifted
in
our
little
orchard
by
the
brook
we
had
read
somewhere
that
the
red
indians
often
make
themselves
or
when
the
winter
is
severe
we
were
anxious
to
try
our
hands
at
making
a
we
wanted
to
know
whether
a
house
with
snow
walls
could
really
be
warm
and
we
pictured
to
ourselves
how
strange
it
would
be
to
be
shut
in
by
walls
of
snow
with
only
one
little
hole
for
air
seeing
nothing
but
the
white
all
round
us
having
no
window
to
look
through
we
thought
that
it
would
be
wonderful
to
have
a
especially
if
snow
fell
after
the
roof
had
been
covered
in
for
then
no
one
could
know
if
the
dweller
were
at
home
one
would
lie
very
still
wrapped
up
in
buffalo
robes
while
all
the
time
the
other
indians
would
be
prowling
about
in
their
looking
for
you
or
perhaps
the
spaniards
would
be
after
you
with
their
bloodhounds
and
you
would
get
down
under
the
snow
in
the
forest
somewhere
and
the
snow
would
fall
and
fall
covering
your
tracks
till
nothing
could
be
seen
but
a
little
tiny
hole
melted
by
your
breath
through
which
you
got
fresh
air
then
you
would
hear
the
horses
and
the
armour
and
the
baying
of
the
hounds
but
they
would
never
find
you
though
their
horses
hoofs
might
almost
sink
through
the
snow
to
your
body
we
went
down
to
the
orchard
hugh
and
i
determined
to
build
a
if
the
drifts
were
deep
enough
we
were
not
going
to
plunge
into
a
drift
and
make
a
sort
of
chamber
by
wrestling
our
bodies
about
as
the
indians
do
we
had
planned
to
dig
a
square
chamber
in
the
biggest
drift
we
could
find
and
then
to
roof
it
over
with
an
old
tarpaulin
stretched
upon
sticks
we
were
going
to
cover
the
tarpaulin
with
snow
in
the
indian
fashion
and
we
had
planned
to
make
a
little
narrow
passage
like
a
fox
earth
as
the
only
doorway
to
the
chamber
it
was
a
bright
frosty
morning
the
sun
shone
the
world
sparkled
the
sky
was
of
a
dazzling
blue
the
snow
gleamed
everywhere
hoolie
the
dog
was
wild
with
excitement
he
ran
from
drift
to
drift
snapping
up
mouthfuls
of
snow
and
burrowing
down
sideways
till
he
was
half
buried
there
was
a
flower
garden
at
one
end
of
the
orchard
and
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
there
was
a
the
house
was
a
large
airy
single
room
overlooking
the
stream
with
a
space
beneath
it
open
to
the
light
where
joe
barnicoat
kept
his
gardening
tools
with
other
such
as
bast
peasticks
sieves
shears
and
traps
for
birds
and
vermin
hugh
and
i
went
directly
to
this
lower
chamber
to
get
a
shovel
for
our
work
we
stood
at
the
entrance
for
a
moment
to
watch
hoolie
playing
in
the
snow
and
as
we
watched
something
caught
my
eye
and
made
me
look
up
sharply
up
above
us
on
the
side
of
the
combe
beyond
the
lane
among
a
waste
of
gorse
in
full
view
of
the
house
and
of
the
orchard
where
we
were
there
was
a
mound
or
barrow
the
of
an
ancient
british
king
it
was
a
hill
some
feet
high
a
year
or
two
before
i
went
there
it
had
been
opened
by
the
vicar
who
found
inside
it
a
narrow
stone
passage
leading
to
an
inner
chamber
walled
with
unmortared
stone
in
the
central
chamber
there
were
broken
pots
a
few
bronze
very
green
and
brittle
and
a
mass
of
burnt
bones
the
doctor
said
that
they
were
the
bones
of
horses
on
the
top
of
all
this
litter
with
his
head
between
his
knees
there
sat
a
huge
skeleton
the
vicar
said
that
when
alive
the
man
must
have
been
fully
six
feet
six
inches
tall
and
large
in
proportion
for
the
bones
were
thick
and
heavy
he
had
evidently
been
a
king
he
wore
a
soft
gold
circlet
round
his
head
and
three
golden
bangles
on
his
arms
he
had
been
killed
in
battle
in
the
side
of
his
skull
just
above
the
circle
of
gold
there
was
a
great
wound
with
a
flint
firmly
wedged
in
the
bone
the
vicar
had
often
told
me
about
this
skeleton
i
remember
to
this
day
the
shock
of
horror
which
came
upon
me
when
i
heard
of
this
great
dead
king
sitting
in
the
dark
among
his
broken
goods
staring
out
over
the
valley
the
country
people
always
said
that
the
hill
was
a
fairy
hill
they
believed
that
the
pixies
went
to
dance
there
whenever
the
moon
was
full
i
never
saw
the
pixies
myself
but
somehow
i
always
felt
that
the
hill
was
uncanny
i
never
passed
it
at
night
if
i
could
avoid
it
now
when
i
looked
up
as
i
stood
with
hugh
watching
the
dog
i
saw
something
flash
upon
the
top
of
the
barrow
in
that
bright
sun
with
all
the
snow
about
many
things
were
sparkling
but
this
thing
gleamed
like
lightning
suddenly
and
then
flashed
again
looking
at
it
sharply
i
saw
that
there
was
a
man
upon
the
barrow
top
apparently
lying
down
upon
the
snow
he
had
something
in
his
hand
turned
to
the
sun
a
piece
of
glass
perhaps
or
a
tin
plate
some
very
bright
thing
which
flashed
he
flashed
it
three
times
quickly
then
paused
then
flashed
it
again
he
seemed
to
be
looking
intently
across
the
valley
to
the
top
of
the
combe
beyond
to
the
very
place
where
the
road
from
salcombe
swings
round
to
the
dip
looking
in
that
direction
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
on
the
top
of
the
wall
against
a
stunted
at
the
curve
of
the
road
i
had
to
look
intently
to
see
him
at
all
for
he
was
in
dark
clothes
which
shaded
off
unnoticed
against
the
leaves
of
the
holly
i
saw
him
jump
down
now
and
again
and
disappear
round
the
curve
of
the
road
as
though
to
look
for
something
then
he
would
run
back
and
flash
some
bright
thing
once
as
though
in
answer
to
the
man
on
the
barrow
it
seemed
to
me
very
curious
i
nudged
hugh
arm
and
slipped
into
the
shelter
of
the
cave
for
a
few
moments
we
watched
the
signaller
then
suddenly
the
watcher
at
the
came
running
back
from
his
little
tour
up
the
road
waving
his
arms
and
flashing
his
bright
plate
as
he
ran
we
saw
him
spring
to
his
old
place
on
the
wall
and
jump
from
his
perch
into
the
ditch
he
had
some
shelter
there
for
we
could
see
his
head
peeping
out
above
the
snow
like
an
apple
among
straw
we
were
so
busy
watching
the
head
among
the
snow
that
we
did
not
notice
the
man
upon
the
barrow
something
made
us
glance
towards
him
and
to
our
surprise
and
terror
we
saw
him
running
across
the
orchard
more
than
towards
us
in
spite
of
the
snow
he
ran
swiftly
we
were
frightened
for
he
was
evidently
coming
towards
us
he
saw
that
we
saw
him
and
lifted
one
arm
and
swung
it
downwards
violently
as
though
to
bid
us
lie
down
i
glanced
at
hugh
and
he
at
me
and
that
was
enough
we
turned
at
once
horribly
scared
and
ran
as
fast
as
we
could
along
the
narrow
garden
path
then
over
the
wall
stumbling
in
our
fright
into
the
wood
we
did
not
know
why
we
ran
nor
where
we
were
going
we
only
felt
that
this
strange
man
was
after
us
coming
in
great
bounds
to
catch
us
we
were
too
frightened
to
run
well
even
had
there
been
no
snow
upon
the
ground
we
could
not
have
run
our
best
we
were
like
rabbits
pursued
by
a
stoat
we
seemed
to
have
lost
all
power
in
our
legs
we
had
a
good
start
perhaps
without
that
fear
upon
us
we
might
have
reached
the
house
but
as
it
was
we
felt
as
one
feels
in
a
nightmare
unable
to
run
though
in
an
agony
of
terror
getting
over
the
wall
was
the
worst
for
there
hugh
stumbled
badly
and
i
had
to
turn
and
help
him
watching
the
man
bounding
ever
nearer
signing
to
us
to
stay
for
him
a
minute
later
as
we
slipped
and
stumbled
through
the
scrub
of
the
wood
we
heard
him
close
behind
us
crying
to
us
in
a
smothered
voice
to
stop
we
ran
on
terrified
and
then
hugh
foot
caught
in
a
briar
so
that
he
fell
headlong
with
a
little
cry
i
turned
at
once
to
help
him
up
feeling
like
the
doe
rabbit
which
turns
they
say
against
a
weasel
to
defend
its
young
ones
it
sounds
brave
of
me
but
it
was
not
i
was
scared
almost
out
of
my
wits
chapter
iv
the
hut
in
the
the
man
was
on
us
in
three
strides
with
his
hand
on
our
collars
frightening
us
out
of
any
power
to
struggle
you
young
fools
he
said
not
unkindly
why
could
you
stop
when
i
waved
to
you
we
did
not
answer
nor
did
he
seem
to
expect
us
to
answer
he
just
swung
us
round
with
our
faces
from
the
house
and
hurried
us
at
a
smart
run
down
the
road
do
you
stir
a
muscle
he
added
as
he
ran
i
not
going
to
eat
you
unless
you
drive
me
to
it
at
the
lower
end
of
the
wood
nearly
half
a
mile
from
our
home
the
scrub
was
very
thick
it
seemed
to
be
a
tangle
of
briars
too
thick
for
hounds
too
thick
almost
for
rabbits
hugh
and
i
had
never
been
in
that
part
of
the
wood
before
but
our
guide
evidently
knew
it
well
for
he
never
hesitated
he
swung
us
on
panting
as
we
were
along
the
clearer
parts
till
we
came
to
a
part
where
our
way
seemed
stopped
by
they
rose
up
thick
and
dark
right
in
front
of
us
our
guide
stopped
and
told
us
to
look
down
among
the
gnarled
there
seemed
to
be
a
passage
or
run
made
by
some
beast
fox
or
badger
going
to
and
from
his
lair
down
you
go
said
our
guide
there
lots
of
room
when
you
try
imagine
you
a
rabbit
we
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
say
no
and
besides
by
this
time
we
had
lost
most
of
our
terror
i
dropped
on
to
my
knees
at
once
and
began
to
squirm
through
the
passage
hugh
followed
me
and
the
strange
man
followed
after
hugh
it
was
not
really
difficult
except
just
at
the
beginning
where
the
stems
were
close
together
when
i
had
wriggled
for
a
couple
of
yards
the
bushes
seemed
to
open
out
to
either
side
it
was
prickly
work
but
i
am
sure
that
we
both
felt
the
romance
of
it
forgetting
our
fear
before
we
reached
the
heart
of
the
clump
in
the
heart
of
the
clump
the
had
been
cut
away
and
piled
up
in
a
sort
of
wall
about
a
small
central
square
some
five
or
six
yards
across
in
the
middle
of
the
square
some
one
had
dug
a
shallow
hollow
filling
rather
more
than
half
of
the
open
space
the
hollow
was
about
eighteen
inches
deep
and
roughly
paved
with
shingle
from
the
beach
well
stamped
down
into
the
clay
it
had
then
been
neatly
wattled
over
into
a
sort
of
trim
hut
like
the
huts
the
used
to
build
near
the
wattling
was
made
fairly
waterproof
by
masses
of
gorse
and
bracken
driven
in
among
the
boughs
it
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
you
could
imagine
it
could
not
be
seen
from
any
point
save
from
high
up
in
one
of
the
trees
surrounding
the
thicket
a
regiment
might
have
beaten
the
wood
pretty
thoroughly
and
yet
have
failed
to
find
it
the
gorse
was
so
thick
in
all
the
outer
part
of
the
clump
that
dogs
would
leave
its
depths
yet
lying
there
in
the
shelter
one
could
hear
the
splashing
babble
of
the
brook
only
fifty
yards
away
and
the
singing
of
a
girl
at
the
mill
a
little
further
up
the
stream
the
man
told
us
to
get
inside
the
shelter
which
we
did
inside
it
was
rather
dark
but
the
man
lit
a
lantern
which
hung
from
the
roof
and
kindled
a
fire
in
a
little
fireplace
this
fireplace
was
covered
with
turf
so
that
the
smoke
should
not
rise
up
in
a
column
we
saw
that
the
floor
of
the
hut
was
heaped
with
bracken
and
there
were
tarpaulin
piled
in
one
corner
as
though
for
bedding
the
man
picked
up
a
couple
of
rugs
and
told
us
to
wrap
ourselves
in
them
you
be
cold
if
you
do
wrap
up
he
said
as
he
tucked
the
rugs
about
us
i
noticed
that
the
of
his
left
hand
was
tattooed
with
three
blue
rings
i
remembered
what
mrs
cottier
had
said
about
the
man
who
had
lighted
her
fire
in
the
barn
so
i
stared
at
him
hard
trying
to
fix
his
features
on
my
memory
he
was
a
man
with
great
arms
and
shoulders
he
was
evidently
a
sailor
one
could
tell
that
by
the
way
of
his
walk
by
the
way
in
which
his
arms
swung
by
the
way
in
which
his
head
was
set
upon
his
body
what
made
him
remarkable
was
the
peculiar
dancing
brightness
of
his
eyes
they
gave
his
face
at
odd
moments
the
look
of
a
fiend
then
that
look
would
go
and
he
would
look
like
a
mischievous
merry
boy
but
more
generally
he
would
look
fierce
and
resolute
then
his
straight
mouth
would
set
his
eyes
puckered
in
as
though
he
were
looking
out
to
windward
the
scar
upon
his
cheek
twitched
and
turned
red
and
he
looked
most
wrathful
and
terrible
well
mister
the
man
said
to
me
would
you
know
me
again
in
case
you
saw
me
yes
i
said
i
should
know
you
anywhere
would
you
he
said
grinning
well
i
was
always
the
beauty
of
the
bunch
he
bit
off
a
piece
of
plug
tobacco
and
began
to
chew
it
he
turned
to
hugh
to
ask
if
he
chewed
tobacco
hugh
answered
no
laughing
ah
said
the
man
do
you
learn
that
my
advice
it
not
easy
to
stop
once
you
begin
he
lay
back
in
his
corner
and
seemed
to
pass
into
a
sort
of
presently
he
looked
up
at
us
again
and
asked
us
if
we
knew
why
we
were
there
we
said
that
we
did
not
well
he
said
it
like
this
last
night
you
here
he
gave
me
a
nudge
with
his
foot
you
young
gentleman
that
looks
so
smart
you
went
for
a
ride
late
at
night
in
the
snow
and
all
see
what
came
of
it
there
was
others
out
for
a
ride
last
night
quite
a
lot
of
others
that
the
law
would
be
glad
to
know
of
with
men
so
scarce
for
the
king
navy
well
the
beaks
are
out
trying
to
find
them
other
ones
there
a
power
of
redcoats
come
here
besides
the
preventives
and
there
they
go
clackity
clank
all
swords
and
horses
asking
at
every
house
what
do
they
ask
said
hugh
they
ask
a
lot
of
things
said
the
man
was
you
last
night
that
one
question
time
did
you
come
in
last
night
another
have
a
look
at
your
horse
he
looks
as
though
he
bin
out
in
the
snow
last
night
lots
of
things
they
ask
and
if
they
got
a
hold
of
you
young
master
why
you
might
have
noticed
things
last
night
and
perhaps
they
might
pump
what
you
noticed
out
of
you
so
some
one
thinks
you
had
best
be
out
of
the
road
when
they
come
who
is
some
one
i
asked
just
some
one
he
answered
some
one
who
gets
more
money
than
i
get
his
mouth
drew
into
a
hard
and
cruel
line
he
lapsed
into
his
still
chewing
his
plug
of
tobacco
some
one
he
added
who
do
like
questions
and
do
like
to
be
talked
about
too
much
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
while
hugh
and
i
looked
at
each
other
oh
i
not
going
to
keep
you
long
said
the
man
them
have
done
asking
questions
about
here
before
your
dinner
time
then
they
ride
on
and
a
good
riddance
your
lady
will
know
how
to
answer
them
all
right
but
till
they
gone
why
here
stay
so
let
be
what
your
name
young
master
he
gave
hugh
a
dig
in
the
ribs
with
his
boot
hugh
he
answered
hugh
said
the
man
hugh
you
wo
never
come
to
much
you
wo
what
name
he
nudged
me
in
the
same
way
jim
i
said
ah
jim
jim
he
repeated
i
known
a
many
jims
some
were
good
in
their
way
too
he
seemed
to
shrink
into
himself
suddenly
i
explain
it
but
he
seemed
to
shrink
like
a
cat
crouched
to
spring
and
his
eyes
burned
and
danced
they
seemed
to
look
right
into
me
horribly
gleaming
till
the
whole
man
became
as
it
were
just
two
bright
spots
of
eyes
one
saw
nothing
else
ah
he
said
after
a
long
cruel
glare
at
me
this
is
the
first
time
jim
and
i
ever
met
the
first
time
we
shall
be
great
friends
we
shall
we
shall
be
better
acquainted
you
and
i
would
wonder
if
i
did
make
a
man
of
you
one
time
or
another
give
me
your
hand
jim
i
gave
him
my
hand
he
looked
at
it
under
the
lantern
he
traced
one
or
two
of
the
lines
with
his
blackened
muttering
some
words
in
a
strange
language
which
somehow
made
my
flesh
creep
he
repeated
the
words
orel
orel
adartha
cay
then
he
glanced
at
the
other
hand
still
muttering
and
made
a
sort
of
mark
with
his
fingers
on
my
forehead
hugh
told
me
afterwards
that
he
seemed
to
trace
a
kind
of
zigzag
on
my
left
temple
all
the
time
he
was
muttering
he
seemed
to
be
almost
in
a
trance
or
as
if
he
were
mad
he
frightened
us
dreadfully
after
he
had
made
the
mark
upon
my
brow
he
came
to
himself
again
they
will
see
it
he
muttered
it
be
bright
enough
the
mark
it
shine
they
know
when
they
see
it
it
is
very
good
a
very
good
sign
it
burns
in
the
dark
they
know
it
over
there
in
the
night
then
he
went
on
mumbling
to
himself
but
so
brokenly
that
we
could
catch
only
a
few
words
here
and
there
black
and
red
knowledge
and
beauty
red
and
black
pleasure
and
strength
what
do
the
cards
say
he
opened
his
thick
and
took
out
a
little
packet
of
cards
from
an
oilskin
case
he
dealt
them
out
first
of
all
in
a
circle
containing
two
smaller
circles
then
in
a
curious
sort
of
star
lastly
in
a
square
with
a
circle
cutting
off
the
corners
queer
queer
he
said
grinning
as
he
swept
the
cards
up
and
returned
them
to
his
pocket
you
and
i
will
know
a
power
of
queer
times
together
jim
he
brightened
up
after
that
as
though
something
had
pleased
him
very
much
he
looked
very
nice
when
he
looked
pleased
in
spite
of
his
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
gipsy
darkness
of
his
skin
here
he
said
let
be
company
d
know
any
knots
you
two
no
neither
of
us
knew
any
knots
except
the
ordinary
overhand
and
granny
knots
well
i
show
you
he
said
it
come
in
useful
some
day
always
learn
what
you
can
that
what
i
say
because
it
come
in
useful
that
what
the
irishman
said
always
learn
what
you
can
you
never
know
that
the
beauty
of
it
he
searched
in
his
pockets
till
he
found
a
small
hank
of
from
which
he
cut
a
piece
about
a
yard
long
see
here
he
said
now
i
teach
you
it
quite
easy
if
you
only
pay
attention
now
how
would
you
tie
a
knot
if
you
was
doing
up
a
parcel
we
both
tried
and
both
made
granny
knots
with
the
ends
sticking
out
at
right
angles
to
the
rest
of
the
yarn
wrong
he
said
those
are
grannies
they
would
jam
so
that
never
untie
besides
being
ugly
there
wrong
ways
even
in
doing
up
a
string
see
here
he
rapidly
twisted
the
ends
together
into
a
there
strength
and
beauty
together
he
said
look
how
neat
it
is
the
ends
tidy
along
the
standing
part
all
so
neat
as
pie
besides
it
never
jam
watch
how
i
do
it
and
then
try
it
for
yourself
very
soon
we
had
both
mastered
the
and
had
tried
our
hand
at
others
the
bowline
the
figure
of
eight
the
and
the
old
he
was
very
patient
with
us
he
told
us
exactly
how
each
knot
would
be
used
at
sea
and
when
and
why
and
what
the
officers
would
say
and
how
things
would
look
on
deck
while
they
were
in
the
doing
the
time
passed
pleasantly
and
quickly
we
felt
like
jolly
robbers
in
a
cave
it
was
like
being
the
hero
of
a
to
sit
there
with
that
rough
man
waiting
till
the
troops
had
gone
it
was
not
very
cold
with
the
fire
and
the
we
were
heartily
sorry
when
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
remark
that
he
must
see
if
the
coast
were
clear
before
he
left
the
hut
he
glared
down
at
us
look
here
he
said
do
you
try
to
go
till
i
give
the
word
but
there
we
friends
no
need
to
speak
rough
to
friends
i
be
back
in
a
minute
the
strange
man
passed
out
of
the
hut
and
along
the
to
the
edge
of
the
gorse
we
heard
his
feet
crunch
upon
the
snow
beyond
rustling
the
leaves
underneath
it
and
then
it
was
very
very
quiet
again
though
once
in
the
stillness
we
heard
a
cock
pheasant
calling
another
pheasant
answered
him
from
somewhere
above
at
the
upper
part
of
the
wood
and
it
occurred
to
both
of
us
that
the
pheasants
were
the
making
their
private
signals
we
had
a
famous
adventure
to
tell
mother
said
hugh
yes
i
said
but
we
had
better
be
careful
not
to
tell
anybody
else
i
wonder
what
they
do
here
in
this
hut
i
suppose
they
hide
their
things
here
till
it
safe
to
take
them
away
where
do
they
take
them
asked
hugh
away
into
dartmoor
i
said
and
there
there
are
wonderful
places
so
old
evans
the
postboy
told
me
what
sort
of
places
asked
hugh
oh
caves
covered
over
with
gorse
and
fern
and
old
copper
and
tin
mines
which
were
worked
by
the
ancient
britons
they
go
under
the
ground
for
miles
so
old
evans
told
me
with
passages
and
steps
up
and
down
and
great
big
rooms
cut
in
the
rock
and
then
there
are
bogs
where
you
can
sink
things
till
it
quite
safe
to
take
them
up
the
keeps
them
quite
sound
it
does
rot
them
like
ordinary
water
sometimes
men
fall
into
the
bogs
and
the
closes
over
them
that
the
sort
of
place
dartmoor
is
hugh
was
very
much
interested
in
all
this
but
he
was
a
quiet
boy
not
fond
of
talking
yes
he
said
but
where
do
the
things
go
afterwards
who
takes
them
nobody
knows
so
old
evans
said
i
answered
but
they
go
they
get
taken
people
come
at
night
and
carry
them
to
the
towns
little
by
little
and
from
the
market
towns
they
get
to
the
cities
no
one
knows
how
i
dare
say
this
hut
has
been
full
of
things
valuable
lace
and
silk
and
all
sorts
of
wines
and
spirits
waiting
for
some
one
to
carry
them
into
the
moor
hush
said
hugh
there
some
one
calling
it
mother
outside
the
at
some
little
distance
from
us
we
heard
mrs
cottier
and
my
aunt
calling
hugh
and
jim
repeatedly
we
lay
very
still
wondering
what
they
would
think
and
hoping
that
they
would
make
no
search
for
us
they
could
have
tracked
us
in
the
snow
quite
easily
but
we
knew
very
well
they
would
never
think
of
it
for
they
were
both
shortsighted
and
ignorant
of
what
the
red
indians
do
when
they
go
tracking
to
our
surprise
their
voices
came
nearer
and
nearer
till
they
were
at
the
edge
of
the
clump
but
on
the
side
opposite
to
that
in
which
the
opened
i
whispered
to
hugh
to
be
quiet
as
they
stopped
to
call
us
they
lingered
for
several
minutes
calling
every
now
and
then
and
talking
to
each
other
in
between
whiles
we
could
hear
every
word
of
their
conversation
it
very
curious
said
my
aunt
can
they
have
got
to
how
provoking
boys
are
it
does
really
matter
said
mims
the
officer
has
gone
and
the
boy
would
only
have
been
scared
by
all
his
questions
he
might
have
frightened
the
boy
out
of
his
wits
i
wonder
where
the
young
monkeys
have
got
to
they
were
going
to
build
like
the
indians
perhaps
they
hiding
in
one
now
we
were
had
she
only
known
it
hugh
and
i
grinned
at
each
other
suddenly
my
aunt
spoke
again
with
a
curious
inflection
in
her
voice
how
funny
she
exclaimed
what
is
it
asked
mrs
cottier
i
almost
sure
i
smell
something
burning
said
my
aunt
i
sure
i
do
do
you
there
was
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
while
the
two
ladies
sniffed
the
air
yes
said
mrs
cottier
there
is
something
burning
it
seems
to
come
from
that
gorse
there
funny
said
my
aunt
i
suppose
some
one
has
lighted
a
fire
up
in
the
wood
and
the
smoke
is
blowing
down
on
us
well
we
go
in
to
dinner
it
no
good
staying
here
catching
our
death
looking
for
two
mad
things
i
suppose
you
did
hear
how
mrs
burns
is
yesterday
the
two
ladies
passed
away
from
the
clump
towards
the
orchard
talking
of
the
affairs
of
the
neighbourhood
a
few
minutes
after
they
had
gone
a
cock
pheasant
called
softly
a
few
yards
from
us
then
the
shook
and
our
friend
appeared
at
the
hut
door
they
gone
all
right
he
said
swords
and
redcoats
and
they
gone
and
a
good
riddance
too
i
should
have
been
back
before
only
your
ladies
were
talking
looking
for
you
so
i
had
to
wait
till
they
were
gone
i
expect
you
want
your
dinner
sitting
here
so
long
well
cut
and
get
it
he
slung
the
into
a
corner
blew
out
the
lantern
and
dropped
a
handful
of
snow
on
to
the
fire
cut
he
continued
you
can
go
get
out
of
this
run
and
get
your
dinners
we
went
with
him
out
of
the
hut
into
the
square
see
here
he
continued
do
you
go
coming
here
you
do
know
of
this
place
see
do
you
show
your
little
tracks
in
this
part
of
the
wood
this
is
a
private
house
this
is
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
now
run
along
and
thank
for
your
company
as
hugh
began
to
squirm
along
the
passage
i
turned
and
shook
hands
with
the
man
i
thought
it
would
be
the
polite
thing
to
do
to
say
properly
will
you
tell
me
your
name
i
asked
have
got
a
name
he
answered
gruffly
none
of
your
business
if
i
had
he
saw
that
i
was
hurt
by
his
rudeness
for
his
face

bitter
on
the
tongue
as
you

find

thing

mr
gorsuch
i
said

careful
of
your
fires

can
smell
them
outside
when
the
wind
blows
down
from
the
wood
fires
he
exclaimed

i
little
bleating
schoolboys
to
tea

and
get
your
porridge
here
he
called
as
i
went
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
here
a
keepsake
for
you
he
tossed
me
a
little
ornament
of
twisted
silver
wire
woven
into
the
form
of
a
double
diamond
knot
probably
by
the
man
himself
thank
you
mr
gorsuch
i
said
oh
do
thank
me
he
answered
rudely
i
tired
of
being
thanked
now
cut
i
wriggled
through
the
clump
after
hugh
then
we
ran
home
together
through
the
wood
just
as
the
was
ringing
for
the
second
time
mrs
cottier
asked
us
if
we
had
not
heard
her
calling
yes
mims
i
said
we
did
hear
but
we
were
hidden
in
a
secret
house
we
wondered
if
you
would
find
us
we
were
close
to
you
some
of
the
time
my
aunt
said
something
about
giving
a
lot
of
trouble
and
being
very
thoughtless
for
others
but
we
had
heard
similar
lectures
many
times
before
and
did
not
mind
them
much
after
dinner
i
took
mims
aside
and
told
her
everything
she
laughed
a
little
though
i
could
see
that
she
was
uneasy
about
hugh
i
would
mention
it
to
any
one
she
said
it
would
be
safer
not
but
oh
jim
here
we
are
all
three
of
us
in
league
with
the
lawbreakers
the
soldiers
were
here
this
morning
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
and
they
two
men
prisoners
with
them
taken
at
tor
cross
on
suspicion
they
to
be
sent
to
exeter
till
the
assizes
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
them
i
dare
say
they
be
sent
abroad
poor
fellows
every
house
is
being
searched
for
last
night
work
it
seems
they
surprised
the
coastguards
at
the
cross
and
tied
them
up
in
their
barracks
before
they
landed
their
goods
and
now
the
whole
country
is
being
searched
by
troops
and
here
are
we
three
innocents
she
went
on
smiling
drawing
us
both
to
her
all
conspiring
against
the
king
peace
i
expect
we
shall
all
be
transported
well
i
shall
be
transported
but
you
have
to
serve
in
the
navy
so
now
we
talk
about
it
any
more
i
had
enough
smuggling
for
one
day
go
out
and
build
a
real
and
then
jim
will
be
a
red
indian
and
we
will
have
a
fight
with
bows
and
arrows
chapter
v
the
last
voyage
of
the
snail
it
was
during
the
wintry
days
that
mrs
cottier
decided
to
remove
us
from
the
school
at
newton
abbot
she
had
arranged
with
the
rector
at
strete
for
us
to
have
lessons
at
the
rectory
every
morning
with
young
ned
evans
the
rector
son
so
when
the
winter
holidays
ended
we
were
spared
the
long
cold
drive
and
that
awful
going
back
to
the
school
we
hated
so
winter
drew
to
an
end
and
the
snow
melted
march
came
in
like
a
lion
bringing
so
much
rain
that
the
brook
was
flooded
we
saw
no
more
of
the
after
that
day
in
the
snow
but
we
noticed
little
things
now
and
then
among
the
country
people
which
made
us
sure
that
they
were
not
far
off
once
when
we
were
driving
home
in
the
evening
after
a
day
at
dartmouth
owls
called
along
the
road
from
just
behind
the
hedge
whenever
the
road
curved
hugh
and
i
remembered
the
pheasants
that
day
in
the
wood
and
we
nudged
each
other
in
the
darkness
wondering
whether
mr
gorsuch
was
one
of
the
owls
after
that
night
we
used
to
practise
the
call
of
the
owls
and
the
pheasants
but
we
were
only
clever
at
the
owl
cry
the
pheasant
call
really
needs
a
man
voice
it
is
too
deep
a
note
for
any
boy
to
imitate
well
but
we
could
cry
like
the
owls
after
some
little
practice
and
we
were
very
vain
when
we
made
an
owl
in
the
wood
reply
to
us
once
at
the
end
of
february
we
gave
the
owl
cry
outside
the
adventure
inn
where
the
road
dips
from
strete
to
the
sands
and
a
man
ran
out
to
the
door
and
looked
up
and
down
and
whistled
a
strange
little
tune
or
scrap
of
a
tune
evidently
expecting
an
answer
but
that
frightened
us
we
made
him
no
answer
and
presently
he
went
in
muttering
he
was
puzzled
no
doubt
for
he
came
out
again
a
minute
later
and
again
whistled
his
tune
though
very
quietly
we
learned
the
scrap
of
tune
and
practised
it
together
whenever
we
were
sure
that
no
one
was
near
us
as
for
the
two
men
taken
by
the
troops
they
were
let
off
the
innkeeper
at
south
poole
swore
that
both
men
had
been
in
his
inn
all
the
night
of
the
storm
playing
the
game
with
the
other
guests
and
as
his
oath
was
supported
by
witnesses
the
case
for
the
king
fell
through
the
never
scrupled
to
commit
perjury
later
on
i
learned
a
good
deal
about
how
the
managed
things
during
that
rainy
march
while
the
brook
was
in
flood
all
over
the
valley
hugh
and
i
had
a
splendid
time
sailing
toy
boats
made
out
of
boxes
and
pieces
of
plank
we
had
one
big
ship
made
out
of
a
long
wooden
box
which
had
once
held
flowers
along
a
we
had
painted
ports
upon
her
sides
and
we
had
rigged
her
with
a
single
square
sail
with
a
strong
southwesterly
wind
blowing
up
the
valley
she
would
sail
for
nearly
a
mile
whenever
the
floods
were
out
and
though
she
often
ran
aground
we
could
always
get
her
off
as
the
water
was
so
shallow
now
one
day
i
suppose
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
month
we
went
to
sail
this
ship
we
used
to
call
her
the
from
our
side
of
the
flood
right
across
the
to
the
old
slate
quarry
on
the
opposite
side
the
distance
was
perhaps
three
hundred
yards
we
chose
this
site
because
in
this
place
there
was
a
sort
of
ridge
causeway
leading
to
a
bridge
so
that
we
could
follow
our
ship
across
the
flood
without
getting
our
feet
wet
in
the
old
days
the
quarry
carts
had
crossed
the
brook
by
this
but
the
quarry
was
long
worked
out
and
the
road
and
bridge
were
now
in
a
bad
state
but
still
good
enough
for
us
and
well
above
water
we
launched
the
from
a
green
shelving
bank
and
shoved
her
off
with
the
long
sticks
we
carried
the
wind
caught
her
sail
and
drove
her
forward
in
fine
style
she
made
a
great
ripple
as
she
went
once
she
caught
in
a
drowned
bush
but
the
current
swung
her
clear
and
she
cut
across
the
course
of
the
brook
like
a
falmouth
packet
hugh
and
i
ran
along
the
causeway
and
over
the
bridge
to
catch
her
on
the
other
side
we
had
our
eyes
on
her
as
we
ran
for
we
feared
that
she
might
catch
or
capsize
and
we
were
so
intent
upon
our
ship
that
we
noticed
nothing
else
now
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
causeway
and
turned
to
the
right
along
the
shale
and
rubble
tipped
there
from
the
quarry
we
saw
a
man
coming
down
the
slope
to
the
water
evidently
bent
on
catching
the
when
she
arrived
we
could
not
see
his
face
very
clearly
for
he
wore
a
grey
and
the
brambles
were
so
high
just
there
that
sometimes
they
hid
him
from
us
he
seemed
somehow
a
familiar
figure
and
the
thought
flashed
through
me
that
it
might
be
mr
gorsuch
come
on
hugh
i
cried
or
she
capsize
on
the
shale
the
very
shallow
so
close
up
to
this
side
we
began
to
run
as
well
as
we
could
over
the
broken
stones
it
no
good
said
hugh
she
be
there
before
we
are
we
broke
through
a
brake
of
brambles
to
a
green
space
sloping
to
the
flood
there
was
the
drawn
up
high
and
dry
on
to
the
grass
and
there
was
the
man
sitting
by
her
on
a
stone
solemnly
cutting
up
enough
tobacco
for
a
pipe
good
morning
mr
gorsuch
i
said
why
it
young
sweethearter
he
answered
why
have
you
got
your
nurses
with
you
he
filled
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
watching
us
with
a
sort
of
quizzical
interest
but
making
no
attempt
to
shake
hands
he
made
me
feel
that
he
was
glad
to
see
us
but
that
nothing
would
make
him
show
it
what
d
call
this
thing
he
asked
pointing
with
his
toe
to
the
that
our
ship
said
hugh
is
it
he
asked
contemptuously
i
thought
it
was
your
with
some
of
baby
bedclothes
on
it
that
what
i
thought
it
was
he
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
seeing
hugh
face
fall
hugh
always
took
a
rough
word
to
heart
and
he
could
never
bear
to
hear
his
mother
mentioned
by
a
stranger
it
a
good
enough
ship
for
us
he
answered
hotly
how
d
know
it
is
said
the
man
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
what
do
know
of
ships
or
what
good
for
you
hey
you
do
know
nothing
of
the
kind
this
rather
silenced
hugh
we
were
both
a
little
abashed
and
so
we
stood
sheepishly
for
a
moment
looking
on
the
ground
at
last
i
took
hugh
by
the
arm
let
take
her
somewhere
else
i
said
softly
i
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
ship
and
turned
to
go
the
man
watched
us
with
a
sort
of
amused
contempt
where
are
you
going
now
he
asked
down
the
stream
i
called
back
drop
it
he
said
come
back
here
i
called
softly
to
hugh
to
run
sha
i
cried
as
we
started
off
together
at
our
best
speed
wo
you
he
called
then
i
make
you
he
was
after
us
in
a
brace
of
shakes
and
had
us
both
by
the
collar
in
less
than
a
dozen
yards
what
little
tempers
we
have
got
he
said
grinning
regular
little
spitfires
both
of
you
now
back
you
come
till
we
have
had
a
talk
i
noticed
then
that
he
was
much
better
dressed
than
formerly
his
clothes
were
of
the
very
finest
and
well
cut
the
buttons
on
his
scarlet
waistcoat
were
new
george
guineas
and
the
buttons
on
his
coat
were
of
silver
very
beautifully
chased
his
shoes
had
big
silver
buckles
on
them
and
there
was
a
silver
buckle
to
the
flap
of
his
grey
slouch
hat
the
tattoo
marks
on
his
left
hand
were
covered
over
by
broad
silver
rings
of
the
sort
the
spanish
used
to
sell
in
dartmouth
after
the
end
of
the
war
he
looked
extremely
handsome
in
his
fine
clothes
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
been
afraid
of
him
yes
he
said
with
a
grin
when
he
saw
me
eyeing
him
my
ship
came
home
all
right
i
was
able
to
refit
for
a
full
due
so
now
we
see
what
gifts
the
queen
sent
we
wondered
what
he
meant
by
this
sentence
but
we
were
not
kept
long
in
doubt
he
led
us
through
the
briars
to
the
ruins
of
the
shed
where
the
quarry
overseer
had
formerly
had
his
office
come
in
here
he
said
shoving
us
in
front
of
him
and
see
what
the
queen
give
you
shut
your
eyes
that
the
style
now
open
when
we
opened
our
eyes
we
could
hardly
keep
from
shouting
with
pleasure
there
on
the
ground
kept
upright
by
a
couple
of
bricks
was
a
model
of
a
revenue
cutter
under
all
her
sail
except
the
big
square
foresail
which
was
neatly
folded
upon
her
yard
she
was
perfect
aloft
even
to
her
pennant
and
on
deck
she
was
perfect
too
with
beautiful
little
model
guns
all
brass
on
their
carriages
pointing
through
the
oh
we
exclaimed
oh
is
she
really
for
us
for
our
very
own
why
yes
he
said
at
least
she
for
you
mr
jim
i
think
you
call
yourself
yes
jim
well
she
for
you
jim
i
got
something
else
the
queen
sent
for
mr
he
bent
in
one
corner
of
the
ruin
and
pulled
out
what
seemed
to
be
a
stout
but
broken
box
this
is
for
you
mr
he
said
to
hugh
we
saw
that
it
was
a
model
of
a
port
of
a
ship
deck
and
side
the
side
was
cut
for
a
which
opened
and
shut
by
means
of
laniards
and
pointing
through
the
opened
port
was
a
model
brass
on
its
carriage
with
all
its
roping
correctly
rigged
and
its
sponges
and
rammers
hooked
up
above
it
ready
for
use
it
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
indeed
both
models
were
for
the
gun
was
quite
eighteen
inches
long
there
you
are
said
marah
gorsuch
that
lot
for
you
mr
them
things
is
what
the
queen
sent
we
were
so
much
delighted
by
these
beautiful
presents
that
it
was
some
minutes
before
we
could
find
words
with
which
to
thank
him
we
could
not
believe
that
such
things
were
really
for
us
he
was
much
pleased
to
find
that
his
gifts
gave
so
much
pleasure
he
kept
up
a
continual
grin
while
we
examined
the
toys
inch
by
inch
like
hey
he
said
yes
i
should
just
think
we
do
we
answered
we
shook
him
by
the
hand
almost
unable
to
speak
from
pleasure
and
now
let
come
down
and
sail
her
i
said
hold
on
there
said
marah
gorsuch
do
be
too
quick
you
going
to
sail
that
cutter
till
you
know
how
you

a
lot
to
learn
first
so
that
must
wait
it
to
be
master
turn
this
morning

you
got
to
do
first
go
off
is
to
sink
that
old
hulk
you
were
playing
with
we
sink
her
at
anchor
with
cannon
he
told
hugh
to
pick
up
his
toy
and
to
come
along
down
to
the
edge
when
he
came
near
to
the
water
marah
took
the
old
and
tied
a
piece
of
string
to
her
bows
by
way
of
a
cable
then
he
thrust
her
well
out
into
the
flood
tied
a
piece
of
shale
as
an
anchor
to
the
other
end
of
the
string
and
flung
it
out
ahead
of
her
so
that
she
rode
at
anchor
trimly
a
few
yards
from
the
bank
now
he
said
we
exercise
great
guns
here
he
produced
a
is
the
magazine
here
he
produced
a
bag
of
bullets
is
the

bag
of
wads

housings
take
out
tompions
now
bear
a
hand
my
lads
we
give
your
old
galleon
a
broadside
we
watched
him
as
he
prepared
the
gun
for
firing
eagerly
lending
a
hand
whenever
we
saw
what
he
wanted
first
of
all
he
said
you
must
sponge
your
gun
there
the
sponge
shove
it
down
the
muzzle
and
give
it
a
screw
round
there
now
tap
your
sponge
against
the
muzzle
to
knock
the
dust
off
there
now
the
powder
he
took
his
and
filled
a
little
funnel
like
the
funnels
once
used
by
chemists
for
filling
bottles
of
with
the
powder
this
he
poured
down
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
now
a
wad
he
said
taking
up
a
screw
of
twisted
paper
ram
it
home
on
to
the
powder
with
the
rammer
the
way

the
shot

put
in
a
dozen
bullets
and
then
top
with
a
couple
more
wads

loaded
those
bullets

go
for
fifty
yards
with
that
much
powder

now
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
prime
her
he
filled
the
with
powder
and
poured
a
few
grains
along
the
base
or
breech
of
the
gun
there
he
said
only
one
thing
more
that
is
aim

mr
hugh
whatever

captain
of
the
gun

a
squint
along

the
notch
on
the
muzzle
against
the
target
then
raise
your
gun

till
the
notch
is
a
little
below
your
target
those
wooden
quoins
under
the
gun
will
keep
it
raised
if
you
pull
them
out
a
little
hugh
lay
down
flat
on
the
grass
and
moved
the
gun
carefully
till
he
was
sure
the
aim
was
correct
let
have
a
match
he
said
to
see
which
is
the
best
shot

linstock

to
fire
with
he
took
up
a
long
stick
which
had
a
slow
match
twisted
round
it
he
lit
the
slow
match
by
a
pocket
flint
and
steel
after
moving
his
powder
away
from
him
now
then
he
cried
are

hugh
dropped
the
lighted
match
on
to
the
priming
the
gun
banged
loudly
leaped
back
and
up
and
fell
over
on
one
side
in
spite
of
its
roping
as
the
smoke
spurted
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
lashing
noise
like
rain
upon
the
water
as
the
bullets
skimmed
along
upon
the
surface
one
white
splinter
flew
from
the
stern
where
a
single
bullet
struck
the
rest
flew
wide
astern
of
her
let
your
piece
cool
a
moment
said
marah
then
we
will
sponge
and
load
again
and
then
jim
try
you
were
too
much
to
the
right
mr
hugh
your
shots
fell
astern
after
a
minute
or
two
we
cleaned
the
gun
thoroughly
and
reloaded
now
said
marah
remember
one
thing
if
you
was
in
a
ship
fighting
that
other
ship
you
would
want
just
to
blaze
away
at
her
broadside
no
you
want
to
hit
her
so
as
your
shot
would
rake
all
along
her
decks
from
the
bow
aft
or
from
the
stern
forrard
you
wait
a
second
master
jim
till
the
wind
gives
her
bows
a
skew
towards
you
or
till
her
stern
swings
round
more
there
she
goes
are
you
ready
now
as
she
comes
round
allow
for
it
fire
very
hurriedly
i
made
my
aim
and
still
more
hurriedly
did
i
give
fire
again
came
the
bang
and
flash
again
the
gun
clattered
over
but
to
my
joy
a
smacking
crack
showed
that
the
shot
went
home
the
shock
made
the
old
roll
a
piece
of
her
bow
was
knocked
off
two
or
three
bullets
ripped
through
her
sail
one
bored
a
groove
along
her
and
the
rest
went
over
her
good
said
marah
a
few
more
like
that
and
she
all
our
own
now
it
my
shot
i
try
to
knock
her
rudder
away
wait
till
she
swings
there
she
comes
there
she
comes
over
a
little
up
a
little
now
fire
he
darted
his
linstock
down
upon
the
priming
the
gun
roared
and
upset
the
bullets
banged
out
the
stern
and
she
filled
slowly
and
sank
to
the
level
of
the
water
her
mast
standing
erect
out
of
the
flood
and
her
whole
fabric
swaying
a
little
as
the
water
moved
her
up
and
down
after
that
we
fired
at
the
mast
till
we
had
knocked
it
away
and
then
we
placed
our
toys
in
the
sheltered
fireplace
of
the
ruin
and
came
away
happy
to
the
bone
talking
nineteen
to
the
dozen
chapter
vi
the
owl
cry
for
the
next
month
we
passed
all
our
afternoons
with
marah
in
the
mornings
the
rector
gave
us
our
lessons
at
strete
then
we
walked
home
to
dinner
then
we
played
with
our
gun
and
cutter
or
at
the
sailing
of
our
boats
till
about
six
when
we
went
home
for
tea
after
tea
we
prepared
our
lessons
for
the
next
day
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
where
we
talked
of
smugglers
and
pirates
till
we
fell
asleep
marah
soon
taught
us
how
to
sail
the
cutter
and
what
was
more
he
taught
us
how
to
rig
her
for
an
hour
of
each
fine
afternoon
he
would
give
us
a
lesson
in
the
quarry
office
showing
us
how
to
rig
model
boats
which
we
made
out
of
old
boxes
and
in
the
sunny
evenings
of
april
we
used
to
sail
our
fleets
ship
against
ship
upon
the
great
freshwater
lake
into
which
the
passes
on
its
way
to
the
sea
sometimes
we
would
have
a
fleet
of
ships
of
the
line
anchored
close
to
the
shore
and
then
we
would
fire
at
them
with
the
gun
and
with
one
of
marah
pistols
till
we
had
shattered
them
to
bits
and
sunk
them
sometimes
marah
would
tell
us
tales
of
the
smugglers
and
pirates
of
long
ago
especially
about
a
pirate
named
van
horn
who
was
burned
in
his
ship
off
mugeres
island
near
campeachy
more
than
a
hundred
years
back
his
ship
was
full
of
gold
and
silver
said
marah
you
can
see
her
at
a
very
low
tide
even
now
i
seen
her
myself
she
is
all
burnt
to
a
black
coal
a
great
spanish
galleon
with
all
her
guns
in
her
i
was
out
fishing
in
the
boat
and
a
mate
said
there
there
she
is
and
i
saw
her
as
plain
as
plain
among
all
the
weeds
in
the
sea
the
water
very
clear
there
and
there
she
was
with
the
fishes
dubbing
their
noses
on
her
and
she
as
full
of
gold
as
the
bank
of
england
the
seas
have
washed
van
horn
bones
white
and
the
bones
of
his
crew
too
eaten
white
by
the
fish
and
washed
white
lying
there
in
all
that
gold
under
the
sea
with
the
weeds
growing
over
them
it
gives
you
a
turn
to
think
of
it
do
it
why
do
they
send
down
divers
to
get
the
gold
asked
hugh
why
said
marah
there
many
has
tried
after
all
that
gold
but
some
the
shacks
took
and
some
the
spaniards
took
and
then
there
was
storms
and
fighting
none
ever
got
a
doubloon
from
her
but
somebody
have
a
go
for
it
again
i
tried
once
long
ago
that
was
an
unlucky
try
though
many
poor
men
died
along
of
that
one
they
died
on
the
decks
he
added
it
was
like
old
van
horn
cursing
us
they
died
in
my
arms
some
of
seven
and
twenty
seamen
and
one
of
them
was
my
mate
charlie
i
have
wandered
away
from
my
story
i
afraid
remembering
these
scraps
of
the
past
but
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now
so
clearly
that
it
seems
to
be
happening
again
there
are
marah
and
hugh
with
the
sun
going
down
behind
the
across
the
lea
and
there
are
the
broken
ships
floating
slowly
past
with
the
perch
rising
at
them
and
there
is
myself
a
very
young
cub
ignorant
of
what
was
about
to
come
upon
me
perhaps
had
i
known
what
was
to
happen
before
the
leaves
of
that
spring
had
fallen
i
should
have
played
less
and
given
more
heed
to
mr
evans
the
rector
now
on
one
day
in
each
week
generally
on
thursdays
we
had
rather
longer
school
hours
than
on
the
other
days
on
these
days
of
extra
work
hugh
and
i
had
dinner
at
the
rectory
with
ned
evans
our
schoolmate
after
dinner
we
three
boys
would
wander
off
together
generally
down
to
black
pool
where
old
spanish
coins
from
some
forgotten
wreck
were
sometimes
found
in
the
sand
after
heavy
weather
had
altered
the
lie
of
the
beach
we
never
found
any
spanish
coins
but
we
always
enjoyed
our
afternoons
there
the
brook
which
runs
into
the
sea
there
was
very
good
for
trout
in
the
way
that
marah
showed
us
but
we
never
caught
any
for
all
our
pains
in
the
summer
we
meant
to
bathe
from
the
sands
and
all
through
that
beautiful
spring
we
talked
of
the
dives
we
would
take
from
the
running
out
into
the
sea
then
we
would
have
great
games
of
ducks
and
drakes
with
flat
pebbles
or
games
of
in
which
our
aim
was
to
drop
a
stone
so
that
it
should
make
no
splash
as
it
entered
the
water
but
the
best
game
of
all
was
our
game
of
among
the
cliffs
on
each
side
of
the
bay
and
this
same
game
gave
me
the
adventure
of
my
life
one
lovely
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
the
may
of
that
year
when
we
were
grubbing
among
the
as
usual
wondering
how
we
could
get
down
the
cliffs
to
rob
the
nests
we
came
to
a
bare
patch
among
the
furze
and
there
lay
a
couple
of
coastguards
looking
intently
at
something
a
little
further
down
the
slope
and
out
of
sight
beyond
the
brow
of
the
cliff
they
had
ropes
with
them
and
a
few
iron
spikes
and
one
of
them
had
his
telescope
on
the
grass
beside
him
they
looked
up
at
us
angrily
when
we
broke
through
the
thicket
upon
them
and
one
of
them
hissed
at
us
through
his
teeth
get
out
you
boys
quick
cut
and
waved
to
us
to
get
away
which
we
did
a
good
deal
puzzled
and
perhaps
a
little
startled
we
talked
about
it
on
our
way
home
ned
evans
said
that
the
men
were
setting
rabbit
snares
and
that
he
had
seen
the
wires
hugh
thought
that
they
might
be
after
eggs
during
their
hours
off
duty
both
excuses
seemed
plausible
but
for
my
own
part
i
thought
something
very
different
the
men
i
felt
were
out
on
some
special
service
and
on
the
brink
of
some
discovery
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
we
broke
in
upon
them
they
were
craning
forward
to
the
brow
of
the
cliff
intently
listening
i
even
thought
that
from
below
the
brow
of
the
cliff
only
a
few
feet
away
there
had
come
a
noise
of
people
talking
i
did
not
mention
my
suspicions
to
hugh
and
ned
because
i
was
not
sure
and
they
both
seemed
so
sure
but
all
the
way
home
i
kept
thinking
that
i
was
right
it
flashed
on
me
that
perhaps
the
had
a
cave
below
the
and
that
the
had
discovered
the
secret
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
but
my
only
thought
was
oh
will
they
catch
marah
will
poor
marah
be
sent
to
prison
and
the
fear
that
our
friend
would
be
dragged
off
to
gaol
kept
me
silent
as
we
walked
when
we
came
to
the
gate
which
takes
you
by
a
short
cut
to
the
valley
and
the
shale
quarry
i
said
that
i
would
go
home
that
way
while
the
others
went
by
the
road
and
that
we
would
race
each
other
walking
to
see
who
got
home
first
they
agreed
to
this
and
set
off
together
at
a
great
rate
but
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
behind
the
hedge
i
buckled
my
satchel
to
my
shoulders
and
started
running
to
warn
marah
it
was
all
downhill
to
the
brook
and
i
knew
that
i
should
find
marah
there
for
he
had
said
that
he
was
coming
earlier
than
usual
that
afternoon
to
finish
off
a
model
boat
which
we
were
to
sail
after
tea
i
ran
as
i
had
never
run
before
i
thought
my
heart
would
thump
itself
to
pieces
but
at
last
i
got
to
the
valley
and
saw
marah
crossing
the
brook
by
the
causeway
i
shouted
to
him
then
and
he
heard
me
i
had
not
breath
to
call
again
so
i
waved
to
him
to
come
and
then
collapsed
panting
for
i
had
run
a
good
mile
across
country
he
walked
towards
me
slowly
almost
carelessly
but
i
saw
that
he
was
puzzled
by
my
distress
and
wondered
what
the
matter
was
what
is
it
he
asked
what
the
rally
for
oh
i
cried
the
coastguards
over
at
black
pool
yes
he
said
carelessly
what
about
they
discovered
it
i
cried
the
cave
under
the
they
discovered
it
his
face
did
not
change
he
looked
at
me
rather
hard
and
then
asked
me
quite
carelessly
what
i
had
seen
two
coastguards
i
answered
two
coastguards
in
the
furze
they
were
listening
to
people
somewhere
below
them
yes
he
said
still
carelessly
over
at
black
pool
i
suppose
they
recognized
you
yes
they
must
have
we
three
are
known
all
over
the
place
and
i
ran
to
tell
you
so
i
see
he
said
grimly
you
seem
to
have
run
like
a
well
you
need
have
there
no
cave
on
this
side
salcombe
except
the
hole
at
tor
cross
what
made
you
run
to
tell
oh
i
said
you
been
so
kind
so
kind
and
i
do
know
i
thought
they
send
you
to
prison
did
you
he
said
gruffly
did
you
indeed
well
they
wo
there
was
no
call
for
you
to
fret
your
little
self
still
you
done
it
i
remember
that
i
always
remember
that
now
you
be
off
to
your
tea
quick
cut
when
he
gave
an
order
it
was
always
well
for
us
to
obey
it
at
once
if
we
did
not
he
used
to
lose
his
temper
so
when
he
told
me
to
go
i
got
up
and
turned
away
but
slowly
for
i
was
still
out
of
breath
i
looked
back
before
i
passed
behind
the
hedge
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
combe
but
marah
had
disappeared
i
could
see
no
trace
of
him
then
suddenly
from
somewhere
behind
me
out
of
sight
an
owl
called
and
this
in
broad
daylight
three
times
the
rose
in
a
long
wail
from
the
shrubs
and
three
times
another
owl
answered
from
up
the
combe
and
from
up
the
valley
too
till
the
place
seemed
full
of
owls
came
the
cries
and
very
faintly
came
answers
some
of
them
in
strange
tones
as
though
the
criers
asked
for
information
as
they
sounded
the
first
owl
answered
in
sharp
broken
cries
but
i
had
had
enough
breathless
as
i
was
i
ran
on
up
the
valley
to
the
house
only
hoping
that
no
owl
would
come
swooping
down
upon
me
and
this
is
what
happened
just
as
i
reached
the
gate
which
leads
to
the
little
bridge
below
the
house
i
saw
joe
barnicoat
galloping
towards
me
on
an
unsaddled
horse
of
farmer
rowser
he
seemed
shocked
or
upset
at
seeing
me
but
he
kicked
the
horse
in
the
ribs
and
galloped
on
crying
out
that
he
was
having
a
little
ride
his
little
ride
was
taking
him
at
a
gallop
to
the
owl
and
i
was
startled
to
find
that
quiet
joe
the
mildest
gardener
in
the
county
should
be
one
of
the
uncanny
crew
whose
signals
still
hooted
along
the
combes
when
i
reached
home
the
others
jeered
at
me
for
a
sluggard
they
had
been
at
home
for
twenty
minutes
and
had
begun
tea
i
let
them
talk
as
they
pleased
and
then
settled
down
to
work
but
all
that
night
i
dreamed
of
great
owls
riding
in
the
dark
with
over
them
filling
the
combes
with
their
hootings
chapter
vii
the
two
coastguards
the
next
morning
when
hugh
and
i
came
to
strete
for
our
lessons
we
found
a
lot
of
yeomen
and
preventives
drawn
up
in
the
village
people
were
talking
outside
their
houses
in
little
excited
groups
jan
edeclog
the
grocer
was
at
the
door
of
his
shop
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
there
was
a
general
rustle
and
stir
something
had
evidently
happened
what
all
the
row
about
mr
edeclog
i
asked
row
he
asked
row
enough
master
jim
two
of
the
coastguards
who
were
on
duty
yesterday
afternoon

disappeared
it
thought
there
been
foul
play
my
heart
sank
into
my
boots
my
head
swam
i
could
hardly
stand
upright
all
my
thought
was
they
have
been
killed
and
all
through
my
telling
marah
and
i
a
murderer
i
do
know
how
i
could
have
got
to
the
rectory
gate
had
not
the
militia
captain
come
from
the
tavern
at
that
moment
he
mounted
his
horse
called
out
a
word
of
command
and
the
men
under
him
moved
off
towards
slapton
at
a
quick
trot
they
have
gone
to
beat
the
lay
banks
said
some
one
and
then
some
one
laughed
derisively
i
walked
across
to
the
rectory
and
flung
my
satchel
of
books
on
to
the
floor
the
rector
wife
came
into
the
hall
as
we
entered
why
jim
she
said
what
is
the
matter
are
you
well
not
very
i
answered
my
dear
she
cried
to
her
husband
jim
not
well
he
looks
as
though
he
seen
a
ghost
poor
boy
why
jim
said
the
rector
coming
out
of
the
the
matter
with
you
had
too
much
jam
for
breakfast
no
i
said
but
i
feel
faint
i
feel
sick
can
i
go
to
sit
in
the
garden
for
a
minute
yes
he
answered
certainly
i
get
you
a
glass
of
cold
water
i
was
really
too
far
gone
to
pay
much
heed
to
anything
i
think
i
told
them
that
i
should
be
quite
well
in
a
few
minutes
if
they
would
leave
me
there
and
i
think
that
mrs
evans
told
her
husband
to
come
indoors
leaving
me
to
myself
at
any
rate
they
went
indoors
and
then
the
cool
air
blowing
on
me
from
the
sea
refreshed
me
so
that
i
stood
up
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
the
words
i
am
a
murderer
a
wild
wish
came
to
me
to
run
to
the
cliffs
by
black
pool
to
see
whether
the
bodies
lay
on
the
grass
in
the
place
where
i
had
seen
them
full
of
life
only
a
few
hours
before
anything
was
better
than
that
uncertainty
in
one
moment
a
hope
would
surge
up
in
me
that
the
men
would
not
be
dead
but
perhaps
only
gagged
and
bound
so
that
i
could
free
them
in
the
next
there
would
be
a
feeling
of
despair
that
the
men
lay
there
dead
through
my
fault
killed
by
marah
orders
and
flung
among
the
gorse
for
the
crows
and
gulls
i
got
out
of
the
rectory
garden
into
the
road
and
in
the
road
i
felt
strong
enough
to
run
and
then
a
frenzy
took
hold
of
me
so
that
i
ran
like
one
possessed
it
is
not
very
far
to
black
pool
but
i
think
i
ran
the
whole
way
i
did
feel
out
of
breath
when
i
got
there
though
i
had
gone
at
top
speed
a
spirit
had
been
in
me
such
as
one
only
feels
at
rare
times
afterwards
when
i
saw
a
i
saw
that
just
such
a
spirit
filled
the
sailors
as
they
loaded
and
fired
the
guns
i
pushed
my
way
along
the
cliffs
through
the
gorse
till
i
came
to
the
patch
where
the
had
lain
the
grass
was
trampled
and
broken
beaten
flat
in
places
as
though
heavy
bodies
had
fallen
on
it
there
were
marks
of
a
struggle
all
over
the
patch
some
of
the
gorse
twigs
were
broken
from
their
stems
some
one
had
dropped
a
small
hank
of
they
had
lain
there
all
that
night
for
the
dew
was
thick
upon
them
what
puzzled
me
at
first
was
the
fact
that
there
were
marks
from
only
two
pairs
of
boots
both
of
the
regulation
pattern
the
men
who
struggled
with
the
coastguards
must
have
worn
moccasins
or
heelless
leather
slippers
made
out
of
some
soft
hide
i
felt
deeply
relieved
when
i
saw
no
bodies
nor
any
stain
upon
the
grass
i
began
to
wonder
what
the
had
done
with
the
coastguards
and
as
i
sat
wondering
i
heard
really
and
truly
a
noise
of
the
people
talking
from
a
little
way
below
me
just
beyond
the
brow
of
the
cliff
that
told
me
at
once
that
there
was
a
cave
even
as
i
had
suspected
i
craned
forward
eagerly
as
near
as
i
dared
creep
to
the
very
rim
of
the
land
i
looked
down
over
the
edge
into
the
sea
and
saw
the
little
blue
waves
creaming
into
foam
far
below
me
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
side
of
the
cliff
with
its
projecting
knobs
of
rock
no
opening
of
any
kind
and
yet
a
voice
from
just
below
me
it
seemed
to
come
from
below
a
little
projecting
slab
a
few
feet
down
a
voice
just
below
me
i
say
said
quite
clearly
evidently
between
puffs
at
a
pipe
i
do
know
so
much
about
that
another
voice
answered
but
i
could
not
catch
the
words
the
voice
i
should
have
known
anywhere
it
was
marah
voice
as
he
called
it
making
a
pleasant
answer
that
settles
it
i
said
to
myself
there
a
cave
and
the
coastguards
are
there
i
be
bound
as
prisoners
now
i
have
to
find
them
and
set
them
free
very
cautiously
i
peered
over
the
examining
every
knob
and
ledge
which
might
conceal
or
lead
to
an
opening
in
the
rock
no
i
could
see
nothing
the
cliff
seemed
to
me
to
be
almost
sheer
and
though
it
was
low
tide
the
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
seemed
to
conceal
no
opening
i
crept
cautiously
along
the
as
near
to
the
edge
as
i
dared
till
i
was
some
twenty
feet
from
the
spot
where
i
had
heard
the
voice
then
i
looked
down
again
carefully
searching
every
handbreadth
for
a
firm
foothold
or
path
down
the
rocks
with
an
opening
at
the
end
through
which
a
big
man
could
squeeze
his
body
no
there
was
nothing
no
living
human
being
could
get
down
that
without
a
rope
from
up
above
and
even
if
he
managed
to
get
down
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
the
sea
for
him
at
the
end
of
his
journey
again
i
looked
carefully
right
to
the
foot
of
the
crag
no
there
was
absolutely
nothing
i
was
off
the
track
somehow
now
just
at
this
point
the
cliff
fell
inland
for
a
few
paces
forming
a
tiny
bay
about
six
yards
across
to
get
along
the
cliff
towards
strete
i
had
to
turn
inland
for
a
few
steps
then
turn
again
towards
the
sea
in
order
to
reach
the
cliff
i
skirted
the
little
bay
in
this
manner
and
dropped
one
or
two
stones
into
it
from
where
i
stood
as
i
craned
over
the
edge
watching
them
fall
into
the
sea
i
caught
sight
of
something
far
below
me
in
the
water
i
caught
my
breath
and
looked
again
but
the
thing
whatever
it
was
had
disappeared
from
sight
it
was
something
red
which
had
gleamed
for
a
moment
from
behind
a
rock
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
i
watched
eagerly
for
a
moment
or
two
hearing
the
sucking
of
the
sea
along
the
stones
and
the
cry
of
the
seagulls
young
in
their
nests
on
the
ledges
then
very
slowly
as
the
slack
water
urged
it
i
saw
the
red
of
a
rather
large
boat
nosing
slowly
forward
apparently
from
the
towards
the
great
rock
immediately
in
front
of
it
the
secret
was
plain
in
a
moment
here
was
a
cave
with
a
and
a
cave
big
enough
to
hide
a
large
seagoing
boat
a
cave
too
so
perfectly
hidden
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
seen
from
any
point
except
right
at
the
mouth
a
coastguard
boat
could
row
within
three
yards
of
the
entrance
and
never
once
suspect
its
being
there
unless
at
a
very
low
tide
the
sea
clucked
strangely
from
somewhere
within
any
men
entering
the
little
bay
in
a
boat
would
see
only
the
big
rock
hiding
the
face
of
the
cliff
no
one
would
suspect
that
behind
the
rock
lay
a
big
cave
accessible
from
the
sea
at
low
tide
in
fair
weather
even
in
foul
weather
good
boatmen
and
all
the
were
wonderful
fellows
in
a
boat
could
have
made
that
cave
in
safety
for
at
the
mouth
of
the
little
bay
there
was
a
great
rock
which
shut
it
in
on
the
southwest
side
so
that
in
our
bad
southwesterly
gales
the
bay
or
cove
would
have
been
sheltered
though
full
of
the
foam
spattered
from
the
sheltering
crag
i
had
found
the
cave
but
my
next
task
was
to
find
an
entrance
and
that
seemed
to
be
no
easy
matter
i
searched
every
inch
of
the
for
a
foothold
but
there
was
nothing
there
big
enough
for
anything
bigger
than
a
i
could
never
have
clambered
down
the
cliff
even
had
i
the
necessary
nerve
which
i
certainly
had
not
the
only
way
down
was
to
shut
my
eyes
and
walk
over
the
and
trust
to
luck
at
the
bottom
and
that
was
one
beyond
me
only
marah
gorsuch
would
have
tried
that
way
no
there
was
no
way
down
the
that
was
certain
now
somebody
i
think
it
was
old
alec
jewler
the
ostler
at
the
tor
cross
had
told
me
that
here
and
there
along
the
coast
but
most
of
all
in
cornwall
near
falmouth
there
had
once
been
arsenic
mines
now
long
since
worked
out
their
shafts
he
said
could
be
followed
here
and
there
for
some
little
distance
and
every
now
and
again
they
would
broaden
out
into
chambers
in
which
people
sometimes
live
even
now
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
some
such
among
the
gorse
quite
close
to
me
so
i
crept
away
from
the
and
began
to
search
among
the
furze
till
my
skin
was
full
of
prickles
though
i
searched
diligently
for
an
hour
or
two
i
could
find
no
hole
big
enough
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
shaft
i
knew
that
a
shaft
of
the
kind
might
open
a
hundred
yards
from
where
i
was
searching
and
i
was
therefore
well
prepared
to
spend
some
time
in
my
hunt
and
at
last
when
i
was
almost
tired
of
looking
i
came
across
a
fox
or
badger
earth
not
very
recent
which
seemed
though
i
could
not
be
certain
to
broaden
out
inside
i
lay
down
and
thrust
my
head
down
the
hole
and
that
confirmed
me
from
up
the
hole
there
came
the
reek
of
strong
ship
tobacco
i
had
stumbled
upon
one
of
the
chapter
viii
the
cave
in
the
cliff
my
heart
was
thumping
on
my
ribs
as
i
thrust
and
wriggled
my
body
down
the
hole
i
did
not
think
how
i
was
to
get
back
again
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
stick
in
the
burrow
and
die
stifled
there
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
my
one
thought
was
i
shall
save
the
coastguards
and
that
thought
nerved
me
to
push
on
careless
of
everything
else
it
was
not
at
all
easy
at
first
for
the
earth
fell
in
my
ears
from
the
and
there
was
very
little
room
for
my
body
presently
as
i
had
expected
the
burrow
broadened
out
i
could
kneel
erect
in
it
quite
easily
and
then
i
found
that
i
could
stand
up
without
bumping
my
head
i
was
not
frightened
i
was
only
very
excited
for
now
that
i
stood
in
the
shaft
the
reek
of
the
tobacco
was
very
strong
i
could
see
hardly
anything
only
the
light
from
the
lighting
up
the
sides
of
the
burrow
for
a
yard
or
two
and
a
sort
of
gleam
a
sort
of
shining
wetness
upon
the
floor
of
the
shaft
and
on
its
outer
wall
i
heard
the
wash
of
the
sea
or
thought
i
heard
it
and
that
was
the
only
noise
except
a
steady
drip
drip
splash
where
water
dripped
from
the
roof
into
a
pool
on
the
floor
for
a
moment
i
stood
still
not
certain
which
way
to
go
then
i
settled
to
myself
the
direction
from
which
i
had
heard
the
voices
and
turned
along
the
shaft
on
that
side
when
i
had
walked
a
few
yards
my
nerve
began
to
go
for
the
gleam
on
the
walls
faded
the
last
glimmer
of
light
went
out
i
was
walking
along
an
unknown
path
in
pitchy
darkness
hearing
only
the
drip
drip
splash
of
the
water
slowly
falling
from
the
roof
suddenly
i
ran
against
a
sort
of
breastwork
of
mortared
stones
and
the
shock
almost
made
me
faint
i
stretched
my
hand
out
beyond
it
but
could
feel
nothing
and
then
downward
on
the
far
side
but
could
feel
nothing
and
then
i
knocked
away
a
scrap
of
stone
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
it
seemed
to
fall
for
several
seconds
before
a
faint
splash
told
me
that
it
had
reached
water
the
shaft
seemed
to
turn
to
the
right
and
left
at
this
low
wall
and
at
first
i
turned
to
the
left
but
only
for
a
moment
as
i
soon
saw
that
the
turning
would
bring
me
more
quickly
to
the
from
which
i
had
heard
the
voices
after
i
had
made
my
choice
you
may
be
sure
that
i
went
on
hands
and
knees
feeling
the
ground
in
front
of
me
i
went
forward
very
very
slowly
with
the
wet
mud
coming
through
my
knickerbockers
and
the
cold
drops
sometimes
falling
on
my
neck
from
the
roof
at
last
i
saw
a
little
glimmer
of
light
and
there
was
a
turning
to
the
left
and
just
beyond
the
turning
there
was
a
chamber
in
the
rock
all
lit
up
by
the
sun
as
clear
as
clear
there
were
holes
in
the
one
of
them
a
great
big
hole
and
the
sun
shone
through
on
to
the
floor
of
the
cave
and
i
could
look
out
and
see
the
sea
and
the
seagulls
going
past
after
fish
and
the
clouds
drifting
up
by
the
horizon
very
cautiously
i
crept
up
to
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
and
then
into
it
so
that
i
could
look
all
round
it
it
was
not
a
very
large
room
i
suppose
it
was
fifteen
feet
square
and
it
looked
rather
smaller
than
it
was
because
it
was
heaped
almost
to
the
roof
in
one
or
two
places
with
boxes
and
kegs
and
the
various
such
as
new
rope
and
spare
anchors
in
one
corner
of
it
in
the
corner
at
which
i
entered
it
a
flight
of
worn
stone
steps
led
downwards
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
aha
i
thought
so
how
you
reach
your
harbour
then
i
crept
up
to
one
of
the
piles
of
boxes
and
cautiously
peeped
over
i
looked
over
cautiously
for
as
i
entered
the
room
i
had
the
eerie
feeling
which
one
gets
sometimes
at
night
i
felt
that
there
was
somebody
else
in
the
room
sure
enough
there
was
somebody
else
two
somebodies
and
my
heart
leaped
up
in
joy
to
see
them
sitting
on
the
ground
tied
by
the
body
to
some
of
the
boxes
over
which
i
peered
were
the
two
missing
coastguards
their
backs
were
towards
me
and
their
hands
and
feet
were
securely
bound
but
they
were
unhurt
that
was
the
great
thing
one
of
them
was
quietly
smoking
filling
the
cave
with
strong
tobacco
smoke
the
other
was
asleep
breathing
rather
heavily
it
was
evidently
a
pleasant
holiday
for
the
pair
of
them
no
other
person
was
in
the
room
but
i
saw
that
on
the
far
side
of
the
chamber
another
gallery
led
on
into
the
cliff
to
another
chamber
and
from
this
chamber
came
the
sound
of
many
voices
talking
in
a
dull
quiet
way
and
the
slow
droning
of
the
song
of
a
drunken
man
i
shut
my
eyes
and
lay
across
the
boxes
as
still
as
a
dead
man
trying
to
summon
up
enough
courage
to
speak
to
the
coastguard
and
all
the
time
the
drunkard
song
quavered
and
shook
and
died
down
and
dragged
on
again
as
though
it
would
never
end
afterwards
i
often
heard
that
song
in
all
its
thirty
stanzas
and
i
have
only
to
repeat
a
line
of
it
to
bring
back
to
myself
the
scene
of
the
sunny
cave
with
the
bound
coastguard
smoking
and
the
smugglers
talking
and
talking
just
a
few
paces
out
of
sight
and
the
gale
it
dismally
as
we
went
to
new
barbary
said
the
singer
and
then
some
one
asked
a
question
and
some
one
struck
a
light
for
his
pipe
and
the
singer
droned
on
and
on
about
the
bold
captain
glen
and
the
ship
which
met
with
such
disaster
at
last
i
summoned
up
enough
courage
to
speak
i
crawled
over
the
boxes
as
far
as
i
could
and
touched
the
coastguard
sh
i
said
in
a
low
voice
do
make
a
sound
i
come
to
rescue
you
the
man
stared
violently
i
dare
say
his
nerves
were
in
a
bad
way
after
his
night
in
the
cave
he
dropped
his
pipe
with
a
little
clatter
on
the
stones
and
turned
to
stare
at
me
sh
i
said
again
do
speak
do
make
a
sound
i
crept
round
the
boxes
to
him
and
opened
my
knife
it
was
a
strong
knife
with
very
sharp
blades
marah
used
to
whet
them
for
me
so
that
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
cut
through
the
which
lashed
the
poor
fellow
to
the
boxes
thankee
master
the
man
said
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
himself
i
was
getting
stiff
now
let
get
out
of
here
d
know
the
way
out
yes
i
said
i
think
i
do
oh
do
make
a
noise
but
come
this
way
this
way
very
quietly
we
stole
out
by
the
gallery
by
which
i
had
entered
we
made
no
attempt
to
rouse
the
sleeping
man
he
slept
too
heavily
and
we
could
not
afford
to
run
risks
i
do
know
what
the
feelings
were
as
for
myself
i
was
pretty
nearly
fainting
with
excitement
i
could
hear
my
heart
go
thump
thump
thump
it
seemed
to
be
right
up
in
my
very
throat
as
we
stepped
into
the
gloom
of
the
gallery
the
smugglers
behind
us
burst
into
the
chorus
at
the
end
of
the
song
o
never
more
do
i
intend
for
to
cross
the
raging
main
but
to
live
at
home
most
and
thus
i
end
my
i
felt
that
if
i
could
get
away
from
that
adventure
i
too
would
live
at
home
most
cheerfully
until
the
day
of
my
death
we
took
advantage
of
the
uproar
to
step
quickly
into
the
darkness
of
the
passage
just
before
we
came
to
the
low
stone
breastwork
which
had
given
me
such
a
shock
a
few
minutes
before
we
heard
some
one
whistling
a
bar
of
a
tune
the
tune
was
the
tune
of
oh
my
true
love
listed
and
wears
a
white
cockade
and
to
our
horror
the
whistler
was
coming
quickly
towards
us
in
another
second
we
saw
him
stepping
along
the
gallery
swinging
a
lantern
he
was
a
big
strong
man
evidently
familiar
with
the
way
back
said
the
coastguard
in
a
gasp
get
back
for
your
life
and
down
that
staircase
the
man
did
see
us
did
even
hear
us
he
stopped
at
the
stone
breastwork
opened
his
lantern
and
lit
his
pipe
at
the
candle
and
then
stepped
on
leisurely
towards
the
chamber
our
right
course
would
have
been
to
go
for
him
knock
him
down
knock
the
breath
out
of
him
lash
his
wrists
and
ankles
together
and
bolt
for
the
entrance
but
the
coastguard
was
rather
upset
by
his
adventure
and
he
let
the
minute
pass
by
had
he
rushed
at
the
man
as
soon
as
he
appeared
but
there
it
is
no
use
talking
we
did
rush
at
him
we
scuttled
back
into
the
chamber
and
then
down
the
worn
stone
steps
cut
out
of
the
rock
which
seemed
to
lead
down
and
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
as
we
hurried
down
leaping
lightly
on
the
tips
of
our
toes
the
quaver
of
the
tune
came
after
us
so
clearly
that
i
even
made
a
guess
at
the
whistler
identity
when
we
had
run
down
the
staircase
about
down
to
we
found
ourselves
in
a
cave
as
big
as
the
church
at
dartmouth
it
was
fairly
light
for
the
entrance
was
large
though
low
and
at
low
water
as
it
was
then
the
roof
of
the
cave
mouth
stood
six
feet
from
the
sea
the
sea
ran
up
into
the
cave
in
a
deep
triangular
channel
with
a
a
natural
ledge
of
rock
on
each
of
the
sides
and
the
sea
entrance
at
the
base
the
sea
made
a
sort
of
clucking
noise
about
the
rocks
and
at
the
right
inland
it
washed
upon
a
of
pebbles
which
clattered
slightly
as
the
swell
moved
them
the
roof
dripped
a
little
and
there
were
little
pools
on
both
the
landings
and
the
whole
place
had
a
queer
dim
green
uncanny
light
upon
it
due
i
suppose
to
the
deep
water
of
the
channel
i
saw
all
these
things
afterwards
at
leisure
i
did
not
notice
them
very
clearly
in
that
first
moment
all
that
i
saw
then
was
a
large
lying
moored
at
the
cavemouth
some
few
feet
lower
down
she
was
a
beautiful
model
of
a
boat
i
had
seen
that
much
in
seeing
her
bow
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
but
of
course
her
three
masts
were
unstepped
and
she
was
rather
a
handful
for
a
man
and
a
boy
we
saw
her
and
made
a
leap
for
her
together
and
both
of
us
landed
in
her
bows
at
the
same
instant
just
as
the
man
with
the
lantern
peering
down
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
asked
us
what
in
the
world
we
were
playing
at
down
there
the
coastguard
made
no
answer
for
he
was
busy
in
the
bows
i
think
he
had
his
knife
through
the
painter
in
five
seconds
then
he
snatched
up
a
i
took
an
oar
and
we
drove
her
with
all
our
strength
along
the
channel
into
or
i
should
say
towards
the
open
sea
and
freedom
hey
cried
the
man
with
the
lantern
chuck
that
are
you
mad
he
took
a
step
or
two
down
the
staircase
in
order
to
see
better
drive
her
oh
drive
her
boy
cried
the
coastguard
i
thrust
with
all
my
force
the
coastguard
gave
a
mighty
heave
the
lugger
slid
slowly
seawards
hey
yelled
the
smuggler
clattering
upstairs
dropping
his
lantern
down
on
us
hey
marah
jewler
smokewell
hankin
all
of
you
they
got
away
in
the
boat
now
the
play
begins
said
the
coastguard
another
heave
and
another
together
now
we
drove
the
lugger
forward
again
so
that
half
her
length
thrust
out
into
the
sea
we
ran
aft
to
give
her
a
final
thrust
out
and
just
at
that
moment
her
bow
struck
upon
the
rock
at
the
cave
mouth
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
we
had
not
realised
that
one
of
us
was
wanted
in
the
bows
to
shove
her
nose
clean
into
the
sea
the
blow
threw
us
both
upon
our
hands
and
knees
in
the
stern
sheets
it
took
us
seconds
to
pick
ourselves
up
and
then
i
realised
that
i
should
have
to
jump
forward
and
guide
the
boat
clear
of
all
outlying
dangers
as
i
sprang
to
the
bows
there
came
yells
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
i
saw
smugglers
coming
full
tilt
towards
us
some
one
cried
out
drop
it
drop
it
you
fool
another
voice
cried
fire
and
two
or
three
shots
cracked
out
making
a
noise
like
a
cannonade
the
coastguard
gave
a
last
desperate
heave
i
shoved
the
bows
clear
and
lo
we
were
actually
gliding
out
the
body
was
outside
the
cliff
in
full
sunlight
giving
a
final
thrust
from
the
cliff
wall
and
then
i
saw
marah
leap
into
the
stern
sheets
as
they
passed
out
of
the
cave
he
gave
a
little
thrust
to
the
coastguard
just
a
gentle
thrust
enough
to
make
him
lose
his
balance
and
topple
over
that
enough
now
he
said
with
a
grim
glance
at
me
that
enough
for
one
time
he
picked
up
the
coastguard
the
man
just
grinned
and
looked
sheepish
he
made
no
attempt
to
fight
with
marah
and
thrust
the
boat
back
into
the
cave
with
deft
strokes
another
smuggler
dropped
down
into
the
stern
sheets
looked
at
the
coastguard
with
a
grin
and
helped
to
work
the
lugger
back
into
the
cave
a
third
man
threw
down
a
sternfast
to
secure
her
a
fourth
jumped
into
the
bow
and
began
to
put
a
long
splice
into
the
painter
which
we
had
cut
we
had
tried
and
we
had
failed
here
we
were
prisoners
again
and
i
felt
sick
at
heart
lest
those
rough
smugglers
should
teach
us
a
lesson
for
our
daring
but
marah
just
told
the
coastguard
to
jump
out
out
you
get
he
said
and
do
try
that
again
i
wo
said
the
coastguard
you
better
not
said
another
smuggler
that
was
all
we
were
helped
out
of
the
lugger
on
to
the
ledge
above
the
channel
and
the
smugglers
walked
behind
us
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
we
had
just
left
the
other
coastguard
was
still
snoring
and
that
seemed
strange
to
me
for
the
last
few
minutes
had
seemed
like
hours
better
bring
him
inside
boss
said
one
of
the
smugglers
he
may
try
the
same
game
he
got
no
young
sprig
to
cut
his
lashings
said
marah
he
be
well
enough
so
they
left
the
man
to
his
quiet
and
passed
on
with
their
other
prisoners
into
the
inner
room
chapter
ix
signing
on
the
inner
room
was
much
larger
than
the
prison
chamber
it
was
not
littered
with
boxes
but
clean
and
open
like
a
frigate
lower
deck
it
was
not
perhaps
quite
so
light
as
the
other
room
but
there
were
great
holes
in
the
cliff
hidden
by
bushes
from
the
view
of
passing
fishermen
and
the
sun
streamed
through
these
on
to
the
floor
leaving
only
the
ends
of
the
room
in
shadow
the
room
had
been
arranged
like
the
of
a
there
were
and
bags
ranged
trimly
round
the
inner
wall
there
was
a
trestle
table
littered
with
tin
pannikins
and
plates
the
roof
was
supported
by
a
line
of
wooden
stanchions
there
were
arm
racks
round
the
stanchions
containing
muskets
cutlasses
and
long
pistols
as
i
expected
there
were
several
hanging
from
nails
or
lying
on
the
floor
i
was
in
the
smugglers
roost
perhaps
in
the
presence
of
captain
sharp
himself
the
drunken
smuggler
who
had
sung
of
captain
glen
was
the
only
occupant
of
the
room
when
we
entered
he
sat
half
asleep
in
his
chest
still
clutching
his
pannikin
still
muttering
about
the
boatswain
he
was
an
italian
by
birth
so
marah
told
me
he
was
known
as
gateo
when
he
was
sober
he
was
a
good
seaman
but
when
he
was
drunk
he
would
do
nothing
but
sing
of
captain
glen
until
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
he
had
served
in
the
navy
marah
told
me
and
had
once
been
a
mate
in
the
but
he
had
deserted
and
now
he
was
a
smuggler
living
in
a
hole
in
the
earth
and
now
said
marah
after
he
had
told
me
all
this
you
and
me
will
have
to
talk
step
into
the
other
room
there
you
boys
he
cried
to
the
other
smugglers
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
master
here
one
of
the
men
he
was
the
big
man
who
had
raised
the
alarm
on
us
i
never
knew
his
real
name
everybody
always
called
him
extry
said
glumly
that
he
was
going
to
oblige
boys
not
for
dollars
marah
turned
upon
him
and
the
two
men
faced
each
other
the
others
stood
expectantly
eager
for
a
fight
step
into
the
other
room
there
repeated
marah
quietly
i
ai
no
pup
nor
no
said
extry
you
ai
going
to
order
me
marah
seemed
to
shrink
into
himself
and
to
begin
to
sparkle
all
over
i
ca
describe
it
that
is
the
effect
he
produced
he
seemed
to
settle
down
like
a
cat
going
to
spring
extry
hand
travelled
round
for
his
and
yet
it
moved
indecisively
as
though
half
afraid
and
then
just
as
i
felt
that
extry
would
die
from
being
looked
at
in
that
way
he
hung
his
head
turned
to
the
door
and
walked
out
sheepishly
according
to
order
he
was
beaten
no
listening
now
said
marah
as
they
filed
out
keep
on
your
own
side
of
the
fence
shall
we
take
gatty
with
us
said
one
of
the
men
let
him
lie
said
marah
he
hove
down
for
a
full
due
gatty
is
the
men
disappeared
with
their
prisoner
marah
looked
after
them
for
a
moment
now
he
said
come
on
over
here
to
the
table
master
jim
he
watched
me
with
a
strange
grin
upon
his
face
i
knew
that
grin
it
was
the
look
his
face
always
bore
when
he
was
worried
now
we
will
come
to
business
lie
back
against
the
hammocks
and
rest
i
going
to
talk
to
you
like
a
father
i
lay
back
upon
the
hammocks
and
he
began
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
done
you
just
about
busted
yourself
d
know
that
you
thought
you
rescue
the
pugs
he
meant
coastguards
well
you
have
you
have
gone
and
shoved
your
head
down
a
wasp
nest
so
you
find
how
did
you
get
here
in
the
first
place
what
gave
you
your
clue
i
saw
the
coastguards
up
above
here
yesterday
i
answered
and
i
thought
i
heard
voices
speaking
from
below
the
brow
of
the
cliff
so
then
i
searched
about
till
i
found
a
hole
and
so
i
got
down
here
ah
said
marah
they
will
be
round
here
looking
for
you
then
take
the
liberty
of
hiding
your
tracks
he
went
in
to
the
other
room
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
one
of
the
other
smugglers
well
he
said
as
he
came
back
to
me
they
not
find
you
now
if
they
search
from
now
till
glory

think

into
the
sea

exclaimed

answered

minute

went
on
nosing
round
like
a
spy

found
out
our
secret

let
as
many
as
fifty
men
in
for
the
gallows

turn
or

to
let
me

cry
out
when

sobs

came

one
of
us
for
long
only
a
trip
or

or

have
to
walk
through
the
window
there
and
that
a
long
fall
and
a
mighty
wet
splash
at
the
bottom
i
thought
of
mims
waiting
at
home
for
me
and
of
the
jolly
with
hoolie
begging
for
toast
and
hugh
face
bent
over
his
plate
the
thought
that
i
should
never
see
them
again
set
me
crying
passionately
i
cried
as
if
my
heart
would
break
why
come

marah

thought

were
a
sailor

sea
and
then

but

home

not
understand
that
till
we
got
a
hold
on
you
the
same
as

there
was
something
in
his
voice
which
gave
me
the
fury
of
despair
i
sprang
to
my
feet
almost
beside
myself
very
well
then
i
cried

took

of

cave
long
afterwards
i
heard
that
he
shot
it
through
the
window
on
a
dart
of
hazelwood
while
my
aunt
and
mrs
cottier
were
at
lunch
that
was
the
last
letter
i
wrote
for
many
a
long
day
that
was
my
farewell
to
boyhood
that
letter
after
a
time
smokewell
brought
in
dinner
and
we
all
at
the
table
for
my
own
part
i
was
too
sick
at
heart
to
eat
much
though
the
food
was
good
enough
there
was
a
cold
fowl
a
ham
and
a
great
after
dinner
the
men
cut
up
tobacco
and
played
cards
and
smoked
and
threw
dice
but
marah
made
them
do
this
in
the
outer
room
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
my
wretchedness
he
slung
one
of
the
hammocks
for
me
and
made
me
turn
in
for
a
sleep
after
a
time
i
cried
myself
into
a
sort
of
uneasy
doze
i
woke
up
from
time
to
time
and
whenever
i
woke
up
i
would
see
marah
smoking
with
his
face
turned
to
the
window
watching
the
sea
then
i
would
hear
the
flicker
of
the
cards
in
the
next
room
and
the
voices
of
the
players
you
go
that
do
you
well
and
i
raise
you
and
then
i
would
hear
the
money
being
paid
to
the
winners
and
wonder
where
i
was
and
so
doze
off
again
into
all
manner
of
dreams
chapter
x
aboard
the
lugger
when
i
woke
up
it
was
still
bright
day
but
the
sun
was
off
the
cliffs
and
the
caves
seemed
dark
and
uncanny
well
said
marah
have
you
had
a
good
sleep
yes
i
said
full
of
wretchedness
i
must
have
slept
for
hours
you
need
a
good
sleep
said
marah
for
it
likely
you
have
none
we
the
like
of
you
and
me
why
we
know
what
the
owls
do
do
we
we
sleep
like
cats
in
the
daytime
be
getting
supper
along
in
about
what
say
to
a
wash
and
that
down
in
the
sea
a
plunge
in
the
cove
and
then
out
and
dry
yourself
why
it
be
half
your
life
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
ca
offer
you
fresh
water
there
next
to
none
down
below
here
but
you
come
down
and
have
a
dip
in
the
salt
he
led
the
way
into
the
next
room
and
down
the
stairs
to
the
water
the
tide
was
pretty
full
so
that
i
could
dive
off
one
ledge
and
climb
out
by
the
ledge
at
the
other
side
so
i
dived
in
and
then
climbed
back
and
dried
myself
with
a
piece
of
an
old
sail
feeling
wonderfully
refreshed
then
we
went
upstairs
to
the
cave
again
and
supped
off
the
remains
of
the
dinner
and
then
the
men
sat
about
the
table
talking
telling
each
other
stories
of
the
sea
it
was
dusk
before
we
finished
supper
and
the
caves
were
dark
but
no
lights
were
allowed
the
smugglers
always
went
into
the
passages
to
light
their
pipes
i
do
know
how
they
managed
in
the
winter
probably
they
lived
in
the
passages
where
a
fire
could
not
be
seen
from
the
sea
in
summer
they
could
manage
very
well
towards
sunset
the
sky
clouded
over
and
it
began
to
rain
i
sat
at
the
cave
window
listlessly
looking
out
upon
it
feeling
very
sick
at
heart
the
talk
of
the
smugglers
rang
in
my
ears
in
little
snatches
so
i
said
a
liar
there
no
man
alive
ever
came
away
not
ever
they
were
all
drowned
every
man
jack
that
what
i
said
yes
said
another
so
they
was
i
saw
the
wreck
myself
the
lower
masts
was
standing
i
did
understand
half
of
what
they
said
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
full
of
terrible
meaning
like
the
words
heard
in
dreams
marah
was
very
kind
in
his
rough
sailor
way
but
i
was
homesick
achingly
homesick
and
his
jokes
only
made
me
more
wretched
than
i
was
at
last
he
told
me
to
turn
in
again
and
get
some
sleep
and
after
i
had
tucked
myself
up
the
men
were
quieter
i
slept
in
a
dazed
fashion
as
i
had
slept
in
the
afternoon
till
some
time
early
in
the
morning
at
about
one
when
a
hand
shook
my
hammock
and
marah
voice
bade
me
rise
it
was
dark
in
the
cave
almost
marah
took
my
arm
and
led
me
downstairs
to
the
lower
cave
where
one
or
two
made
it
somewhat
lighter
there
were
nearly
twenty
men
gathered
together
in
the
cave
and
i
could
see
that
the
lugger
had
been
half
filled
with
stores
all
securely
stowed
ready
for
the
sea
a
little
mannikin
in
a
white
caped
overcoat
was
directing
matters
talking
sometimes
in
english
sometimes
in
french
but
always
with
a
refined
accent
and
in
picked
phrases
he
was
clean
shaven
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
his
eyes
glittered
in
the
the
english
smugglers
addressed
him
as
captain
sharp
but
i
learnt
afterwards
that
captain
sharp
was
the
name
by
which
all
their
officers
were
known
and
that
there
were
at
least
twenty
other
captain
sharps
scattered
along
the
coast
at
the
time
i
thought
that
this
man
was
the
supreme
head
the
man
who
had
sent
mrs
cottier
her
present
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
me
that
night
of
the
here
marah
he
said
when
he
saw
that
i
was
taking
too
much
notice
of
him
stow
that
lad
away
in
the
bows
he
will
be
recognising
me
come
on
jim
said
marah
jump
into
the
boat
my
son
but
where
are
we
going
i
asked
dismayed
going
he
answered
going
going
to
make
a
man
of
you
going
to
france
my
son
i
hung
back
frightened
and
wretched
he
swung
me
lightly
off
the
ledge
into
the
lugger
bows
now
come
he
said
you
not
going
to
cry
i
going
to
make
a
man
of
you
here
you
must
put
on
this
suit
of
and
these
here
or
you
be
cold
to
the
bone
if
sick
put
on
son
before
we
sail
he
did
give
me
time
to
think
or
to
refuse
but
forced
the
clothes
upon
me
they
were
a
world
too
big
there
he
said
now
you
quite
the
sailor
he
gave
a
hail
to
the
little
dapper
man
above
him
we
all
ready
captain
sharp
he
cried
so
soon
as
you
like
right
said
the
captain
you
know
what
you
got
to
do
shove
off
boys
a
dozen
more
smugglers
leaped
down
upon
the
lugger
the
gaskets
were
cast
off
the
sails
a
few
ropes
were
flung
clear
i
saw
one
or
two
men
coiling
away
the
lines
which
had
lashed
us
to
the
rocks
the
dapper
man
waved
his
hands
and
skipped
up
the
staircase
jim
said
some
one
so
long
so
long
cried
the
smugglers
to
their
friends
strong
hands
walked
along
the
ledge
with
the
sternfast
helping
to
drag
us
from
the
cave
quietly
now
said
marah
as
the
lugger
moved
out
into
the
night
heave
oh
heave
said
the
seamen
as
they
thrust
her
forward
to
the
sea
the
sea
air
beat
freshly
upon
me
a
drop
or
two
of
rain
fell
wetting
my
skin
the
water
talked
under
the
keel
and
along
the
we
were
out
of
the
cave
we
were
at
sea
the
cave
and
the
cliff
were
a
few
yards
from
us
we
were
moving
out
into
the
unknown
aft
with
the
boy
out
of
the
way
said
some
one
a
hand
led
me
aft
to
the
stern
sheets
and
there
was
marah
at
the
tiller
get
sail
on
her
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
men
ran
to
the
yards
and
masts
the
masts
were
stepped
and
the
yards
hoisted
quietly
there
was
a
little
rattle
of
sheets
and
blocks
the
sails
slatted
once
or
twice
then
the
lugger
passed
from
the
last
shelter
of
the
cliff
the
wind
caught
us
and
made
us
heel
a
little
the
men
went
to
the
weather
side
the
noise
of
talking
water
deepened
soon
the
water
creamed
into
brightness
as
we
drove
through
it
they
set
the
little
main
topsail
luggers
were
never
very
strictly
rigged
in
those
days
there
the
start
light
jim
said
marah
bid
it
see
it
no
more
for
a
week
they
were
very
quiet
in
the
lugger
no
one
spoke
except
when
the
steersman
was
relieved
or
when
the
master
wished
something
done
among
the
rigging
the
men
settled
down
on
the
weather
side
with
their
pipes
and
quids
and
all
through
the
short
summer
night
we
lay
there
huddled
half
asleep
together
running
to
the
south
like
a
stag
at
dawn
the
wind
breezed
up
and
the
lugger
leaped
and
bounded
till
i
felt
giddy
but
they
shortened
no
sail
only
let
her
drive
and
stagger
wasting
no
ounce
of
the
fair
wind
the
sun
came
up
the
waves
sparkled
and
the
lugger
drove
on
for
france
lashing
the
sea
into
foam
and
lying
along
on
her
side
i
did
take
much
notice
of
things
for
i
felt
giddy
and
stunned
but
the
change
in
my
circumstances
had
been
so
great
the
life
in
the
lugger
was
so
new
and
strange
to
me
that
i
really
did
not
feel
keen
sorrow
for
being
away
from
my
friends
i
just
felt
stunned
and
crushed
marah
was
at
the
taffrail
looking
out
over
the
water
with
one
hand
on
the
rail
he
grinned
at
me
whenever
the
sprays
rose
up
and
crashed
down
upon
us
ha
he
would
say
there
she
sprays
that
beats
your
and
he
would
laugh
to
see
me
duck
whenever
a
very
heavy
spray
flung
itself
into
the
boat
we
were
tearing
along
at
a
great
pace
and
there
were
two
men
at
the
tiller
marah
was
driving
his
boat
in
order
to
make
a
passage
we
leaped
and
shook
and
lay
down
and
rushed
like
a
thing
possessed
our
sails
were
dark
with
the
spray
nearly
every
man
on
board
was
wet
through
marah
called
me
to
him
and
took
me
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
with
one
hand
see
here
he
said
putting
his
mouth
against
my
ear
look
just
as
though
nothing
was
happening
you
see
that
old
gateo
at
the
lee
tiller
well
watch
him
for
a
moment
now
look
beyond
his
red
cap
at
the
sea
what
that
your
eyes
are
younger
i
use
tobacco
too
much
to
have
good
eyes
what
that
on
the
sea
there
i
looked
hard
whenever
the
lugger
rose
up
in
a
swell
it
a
sail
i
said
in
a
low
voice
a
small
sail
a
cutter
by
the
look
of
her
yes
he
said
she
a
cutter
now
turn
to
windward
what
d
make
of
that
he
jerked
himself
around
to
stare
to
windward
and
ahead
of
us
very
far
away
i
could
not
say
how
far
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
several
ships
but
the
sprays
drove
into
my
face
and
the
wind
blew
the
tears
out
of
my
eyes
ships
i
answered
him
a
lot
of
ships
a
whole
convoy
of
ships
ah

answered
that
no
convoy

fleet

brest

was
dead

thank
your
stars

have
not

far

go
there
france

to
leeward

close
call

get

shall
not
home
it
depends
my

chapter
xi
the
frigate
laocoon
by
this
time
the
other
smugglers
had
become
alarmed
the
longboat
gun
which
worked
on
a
slide
abaft
all
was
cleared
and
the
two
little
cohorns
or
guns
which
pointed
over
the
sides
were
trained
and
loaded
a
man
swarmed
up
the
mainmast
to
look
around
the
cutter
bearing
up
to
close
he
called
out
i
see
she
the
salcombe
boat
that
shows
they
have
information
said
marah
grimly
otherwise
they
not
be
looking
for
us
here
some
one
had
been
talking
to
his
wife
he
hailed
the
masthead
again
have
the
frigates
seen
us
yet
for
answer
the
man
took
a
hurried
glance
to
windward
turned
visibly
white
to
the
lips
and
slid
down
a
rope
to
the
deck
bearing
down
fast
under
stunsails
he
reported
the
cutter
signalled
them
with
her
topsail
there
three
frigates
coming
down
he
added
right
said
marah
i
go
up
and
see
for
myself
he
went
up
and
came
down
again
looking
very
ugly
he
evidently
thought
that
he
was
in
a
hole
as
she
goes
he
called
to
the
helmsman
get
all
you
can
on
the
sheets
boys
now
jim
you
up
a
tree
you
within
an
hour
of
being
pressed
into
the
navy
how
ye
like
to
be
a
ship
boy
hey
and
get
tickled
up
by
a
i
should
like
it
at
all
i
answered
you
like
it
a
jolly
sight
less
than
that
said
he
and
it
what
you
probably
be
we
ten
miles
from
home
the
cutter
in
the
road
the
frigates
will
be
on
us
in
it
will
be
a
mighty
close
call
my
son
we
shall
have
to
fight
to
get
clear
at
that
instant
of
time
something
went
overhead
with
a
curious
whanging
whine
that
a
ball
said
marah
pointing
to
a
spurt
upon
a
wave
the
cutter
wants
us
to
stop
and
have
breakfast
with
whang
went
another
shot
flying
far
overhead
fire
away
said
marah
you
more
than
a
mile
away
you
will
not
hit
us
at
that
range
he
shifted
his
course
a
little
edging
more
towards
the
shore
so
as
to
cut
transversely
across
the
cutter
bows
we
ran
for
twenty
minutes
in
the
course
of
the
frigates
by
that
time
the
cutter
was
within
half
a
mile
and
the
frigates
within
three
miles
of
us
all
the
cutter
guns
were
peppering
at
us
a
shot
or
two
went
through
our
sails
one
shot
knocked
a
splinter
from
our
fiferail
they
shoot
a
treat
do
they
said
marah
another
minute
and
they
will
be
knocking
away
a
spar
just
as
he
spoke
there
came
another
shot
from
the
cutter
something
aloft
went
crack
a
rope
unreeved
from
its
pulley
and
rattled
on
to
the
deck
the
mizen
came
down
in
a
heap
the
halliards
had
been
cut
clean
through
the
men
leaped
to
repair
the
damage
it
took
but
a
minute
or
two
but
we
had
lost
way
the
next
shot
took
us
square
amidships
and
tore
off
a
yard
of
our
lee
side
we
must
give
them
one
in
return
he
said
aft
to
the
gun
boys
the
men
trained
the
long
gun
on
the
cutter
oh
marah
i
said
do
fire
on
englishmen
who
began
the
firing
he
answered
i
going
to
knock
away
some
of
their
sails
stand
clear
of
the
breech
he
shouted
as
he
pulled
the
the
gun
roared
and
recoiled
a
hole
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
the
swelling
square
foresail
of
the
cutter
load
with
and
chain
said
marah
another
like
that
and
we
shall
rip
the
whole
sail
off
mind
your
eye
there
goes
her
gun
again
this
time
the
shot
struck
the
sea
beside
us
sending
a
spout
of
water
over
our
rail
again
marah
pulled
his
the
gun
fell
over
on
its
side
and
the
cutter
mast
seemed
to
collapse
into
itself
as
though
it
were
wrapping
itself
up
in
its
own
canvas
a
huge
loose
clue
of
sail
the
foresail
starboard
leach
flew
up
into
the
air
the
boom
swung
after
it
the
gaff
toppled
over
from
above
we
saw
the
topmast
dive
like
a
lunging
rapier
into
the
sea
we
had
torn
the
foresail
in
two
and
the
shot
passing
on
had
smashed
the
foremast
just
below
the
cap
all
her
sails
lay
in
a
confused
heap
just
forward
of
the
mast
that
done
her
said
one
of
the
smugglers
she
ca
even
use
her
gun
now
hooray
cried
another
we
the
boys
for
a
lark
are
you
said
marah
we
got
the
frigates
to
clear
yet
my
son
they
be
in
range
in
two
minutes
or
less
look
at
them
tearing
after
us
in
chase
under
all
sail
came
the
frigates
their
bows
were
burrowing
into
white
heaps
of
foam
we
could
see
the
red
and
the
shining
we
could
see
the
scarlet
coats
of
the
marines
and
the
glint
of
brass
on
the
poops
a
flame
spurted
from
the
bows
of
the
leader
she
was
firing
a
shot
over
us
to
bid
us
heave
to
the
smugglers
looked
at
each
other
they
felt
that
the
game
was
up
bang
another
shot
splashed
into
the
sea
beside
us
and
bounded
on
from
wave
to
wave
sending
up
huge
splashes
at
each
bound
a
third
shot
came
from
the
second
frigate
but
this
also
missed
marah
was
leaning
over
our
lee
rail
looking
at
the
coast
of
france
still
several
miles
away
white
water
he
cried
suddenly
here
the
green
stones
we
shall
do
them
yet
i
could
see
no
green
stones
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
on
our
the
sea
was
all
a
cream
of
foam
above
reefs
and
sands
just
covered
by
the
tide
if
they
were
to
help
us
it
was
none
too
soon
for
by
this
time
the
leading
frigate
was
only
a
hundred
yards
from
us
her
vast
masts
towered
over
us
i
could
look
into
her
open
bow
ports
i
could
see
the
men
at
the
bow
guns
waiting
for
the
word
to
fire
i
have
often
seen
ships
since
then
but
i
never
saw
any
ship
so
splendid
and
so
terrible
as
that
one
she
was
the
and
her
figurehead
was
twined
with
serpents
the
line
of
her
ports
was
of
a
dull
yellow
colour
and
as
all
her
ports
were
open
the
made
scarlet
marks
all
along
it
her
great
lower
studdingsail
swept
out
from
her
side
for
all
the
world
like
a
raking
the
top
of
the
sea
for
us
an
officer
stood
on
the
forecastle
with
a
in
his
hand
stand
by
cried
marah
they
going
to
hail
us
ahoy
the
lugger
there
yelled
the
officer
heave
to
at
once
or
i
sink
you
heave
to
answer
him
in
french
said
marah
to
one
of
the
men
a
man
made
some
answer
in
french
i
think
he
said
he
understand
the
officer
told
a
marine
to
fire
at
us
the
bullet
whipped
through
the
mizen
bang
went
one
of
the
guns
just
over
our
heads
we
felt
a
rush
and
shock
and
our
mizen
mast
and
sail
went
over
the
side
marah
stood
up
and
raised
his
hand
we
surrender
sir
he
shouted
we
surrender
down
helm
boys
we
swung
round
on
our
keel
and
came
to
the
wind
we
saw
the
officer
nod
approval
and
speak
a
word
to
the
and
then
the
great
ship
lashed
past
us
a
mighty
straining
heaving
fabric
of
beauty
whose
lower
were
wet
to
their
irons
now
for
it
said
marah
he
hauled
his
wind
and
the
lugger
shot
off
towards
the
broken
water
if
we
get
among
those
shoals
he
said
we
safe
as
houses
the
frigate
done
she
going
at
such
a
pace
they
will
never
stop
her
not
till
she
gone
a
mile
not
without
they
rip
the
masts
out
of
her
that
officer
ought
to
have
known
that
trick
that
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
mr
jim
if
ever
you
in
a
little
ship
and
you
get
chased
by
a
big
ship
you
keep
on
till
right
on
top
of
you
and
then
luff
hard
all
you
know
and
the
chances
are
you
get
a
mile
start
before
they
come
round
to
go
after
you
we
had
in
fact
doubled
like
a
hare
and
the
frigate
like
a
greyhound
had
torn
on
ahead
unable
to
turn
we
saw
her
lower
stunsail
boom
carry
away
as
they
took
in
the
sail
and
we
could
see
her
seamen
running
to
their
quarters
ready
to
brace
the
yards
and
bring
the
ship
to
her
new
course
the
lugger
soon
gathered
way
and
tore
on
but
it
was
now
blowing
very
fresh
indeed
and
the
sea
before
us
was
one
lashing
smother
of
breakers
marah
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
that
he
was
watching
the
frigates
one
a
slower
sailer
than
the
other
was
sailing
back
to
the
fleet
the
second
had
hove
to
about
a
mile
away
with
her
longboat
lowered
to
pursue
us
the
boat
was
just
clear
of
her
shadow
crowding
all
sail
in
order
to
get
to
us
the
third
ship
the
ship
which
we
had
tricked
was
hauling
to
the
wind
with
her
light
canvas
clued
up
for
furling
in
a
few
moments
she
was
braced
up
and
standing
towards
us
but
distant
about
a
mile
suddenly
both
frigates
opened
fire
and
the
great
ripped
up
the
sea
all
round
us
they
sink
us
sure
said
one
of
the
smugglers
with
a
grin
the
men
all
laughed
and
i
laughed
too
we
were
all
so
very
much
interested
in
what
was
going
to
happen
the
guns
fired
steadily
one
after
the
other
in
a
long
rolling
roar
the
men
laughed
at
each
shot
they
could
hit
the
sea
they
said
derisively
the
navy
gunners
are
no
use
at
all
no
said
marah
they
not
but
if
they
keep
their
course
another
they
be
on
the
sunk
reef
and
a
lot
of
be
drowned
i
wonder
will
the
old
take
a
hint
give
the
pennant
said
gateo
ay
give
it
said
others
do
let
wreck
marah
opened
the
and
took
out
a
blue
pennant
it
had
a
white
ball
in
the
middle
of
it
which
he
hoisted
to
his
main
truck
let
her
go
off
he
cried
to
the
helmsman
for
just
a
moment
we
lay
broadside
on
to
the
frigate
a
fair
target
for
her
guns
so
that
she
could
see
the
pennant
blowing
out
clear
you
see
jim
asked
marah
that
pennant
means
are
standing
in
to
danger
now
we
will
luff
again
i
do
think
they
saw
it
said
one
of
the
sailors
as
another
shot
flew
over
us
they
have
to
send
below
to
get
their
glasses
those
blind
navy
jokers
off
said
marah
quickly
and
again
we
lay
broadside
on
tumbling
in
the
swell
shipping
heavy
sprays
this
time
they
saw
it
for
the
helm
was
put
down
her
great
sails
shivered
and
threshed
and
she
stood
off
on
the
other
tack
as
she
stood
away
we
saw
an
officer
leap
on
to
the
taffrail
holding
on
by
the
mizen
backstays
tar
my
wig
said
marah
if
he
is
bowing
to
us
sure
enough
the
officer
took
off
his
hat
to
us
and
bowed
gracefully
polite
young
man
said
marah
we
will
give
them
the
other
pennant
another
flag
a
red
pennant
was
hoisted
in
place
of
the
blue
wishing
you
a
pleasant
voyage
said
marah
now
luff
my
sons
that
longboat
will
be
on
to
us
indeed
the
longboat
had
crept
to
within
six
hundred
yards
of
us
it
was
time
we
were
moving
though
the
guns
were
no
longer
firing
on
us
from
the
ships
mind
your
helm
boys
said
marah
as
he
went
forward
to
the
bows
i
got
to
con
you
through
a
lot
of
bad
rocks
you
have
to
steer
small
or
die
chapter
xii
black
pool
bay
i
shall
not
describe
our
passage
through
the
green
stones
to
kermorvan
but
in
nightmares
it
comes
back
to
me
we
seemed
to
wander
in
blind
avenues
hedged
in
by
seas
and
broken
water
awful
with
the
menace
of
death
for
five
or
six
hours
we
dodged
among
rocks
and
reefs
wet
with
the
spray
that
broke
upon
them
and
sick
at
heart
at
the
sight
of
the
whirlpools
and
eddies
i
think
that
they
are
called
the
green
stones
because
the
seas
break
over
them
in
bright
green
heaps
here
and
there
among
them
the
tide
seized
us
and
swept
us
along
and
in
the
races
where
this
happened
there
were
sucking
whirlpools
strong
enough
to
twist
us
round
how
often
we
were
near
our
deaths
i
can
not
think
but
time
and
time
again
the
backwash
of
a
breaker
came
over
our
rail
in
a
green
mass
when
we
sailed
into
kermorvan
i
was
only
half
conscious
from
the
cold
and
wet
i
just
remember
some
one
helping
me
up
some
steps
with
seaweed
on
them
we
stayed
in
kermorvan
for
a
week
or
more
waiting
for
our
cargo
of
brandy
silk
and
tobacco
and
for
letters
and
papers
addressed
to
the
french
in
the
huge
prison
on
dartmoor
i
was
very
unhappy
in
kermorvan
thinking
of
home
it
would
have
been
less
dismal
had
i
had
more
to
do
but
i
was
unoccupied
and
a
prisoner
in
charge
of
an
old
french
woman
who
spoke
little
english
so
that
time
passed
slowly
indeed
at
last
we
set
sail
up
the
coast
hugging
the
french
shore
touching
at
little
ports
for
more
cargo
till
we
came
to
cartaret
here
a
french
gentleman
he
was
a
military
spy
came
aboard
us
and
then
we
waited
two
or
three
days
for
a
fair
wind
at
last
the
wind
drew
to
the
east
and
we
spread
all
sail
for
home
on
a
wild
morning
when
the
fishermen
were
unable
to
keep
the
sea
at
dusk
we
were
so
near
to
home
that
i
could
see
the
start
and
the
whole
coast
from
salcombe
to
dartmoor
in
fact
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
see
it
for
we
doused
our
sails
several
miles
out
to
sea
and
lay
tossing
in
the
storm
to
a
waiting
for
the
short
summer
night
to
fall
when
it
grew
dark
enough
of
course
in
that
time
of
year
it
is
never
very
dark
even
in
a
storm
we
stole
in
mile
by
mile
to
somewhere
off
flushing
where
we
showed
a
light
we
showed
it
three
times
from
the
bow
and
at
the
last
showing
a
red
light
gleamed
from
flushing
church
that
was
the
signal
to
tell
us
that
all
was
safe
so
then
we
sailed
into
black
pool
bay
where
the
breakers
were
beating
fiercely
in
trampling
ranks
there
were
about
a
dozen
men
gathered
together
on
the
beach
we
sailed
right
in
till
we
were
within
ten
yards
of
the
sands
and
there
we
moored
the
lugger
by
the
head
and
stern
so
that
her
freight
could
be
discharged
the
men
on
the
beach
waded
out
through
the
surf
though
it
took
them
up
to
the
armpits
and
the
men
in
the
lugger
passed
the
kegs
and
boxes
to
them
waves
which
were
unusually
big
would
knock
down
the
men
in
the
water
burden
and
all
and
then
there
would
be
laughter
from
all
hands
and
grumbles
from
the
victim
i
never
saw
men
work
harder
the
freight
was
all
flung
out
and
landed
and
packed
in
half
an
hour
it
passed
out
in
a
continual
stream
from
both
sides
of
the
boat
everybody
working
like
a
person
possessed
and
when
the
lugger
was
nearly
free
of
cargo
and
the
string
of
workers
in
the
water
was
broken
on
the
port
side
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
a
chance
of
escape
it
flashed
into
my
mind
that
it
was
dark
that
no
one
in
the
lugger
was
watching
me
that
the
set
of
the
tide
would
drive
me
ashore
i
was
not
a
good
swimmer
but
i
knew
that
in
five
yards
i
should
be
able
to
touch
bottom
and
that
in
another
two
hours
or
less
i
should
be
in
bed
at
home
with
all
my
troubles
at
an
end
when
i
thought
of
escaping
i
was
standing
alone
at
the
stern
a
lot
of
the
boat
crew
were
in
the
water
going
ashore
to
run
the
cargo
on
horseback
to
the
wilds
of
dartmoor
the
others
were
crowded
at
the
bow
watching
them
go
or
watching
the
men
upon
the
beach
moving
here
and
there
by
torchlight
packing
the
kegs
on
the
horses
backs
it
was
a
wild
scene
the
wind
blew
the
torches
into
great
red
fiery
banners
the
waves
hissed
and
spumed
and
glimmered
into
brightness
you
could
see
the
horses
shying
and
the
men
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
now
and
then
some
one
would
cry
out
and
then
a
horse
would
whinny
all
the
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
unnecessary
talk
and
babble
the
voices
and
laughter
of
the
seamen
came
in
bursts
as
the
wind
lulled
every
now
and
then
a
wave
would
burst
with
a
smashing
noise
and
the
smugglers
would
laugh
at
those
wetted
by
the
spray
i
saw
that
i
had
a
better
chance
of
landing
unobserved
on
the
port
side
so
i
stole
to
that
side
crawled
over
the
gunwale
and
slid
into
the
sea
without
a
splash
the
water
made
me
gasp
at
first
but
that
only
lasted
a
second
i
made
a
gentle
stroke
or
two
towards
the
shore
trying
not
to
raise
my
head
much
and
really
i
felt
quite
safe
before
i
had
made
three
strokes
when
you
swim
in
the
sea
at
night
you
see
so
little
that
you
feel
that
you
in
your
turn
can
not
be
seen
either
all
that
i
could
see
was
a
confused
mass
of
shore
with
torchlights
every
now
and
then
that
would
be
hidden
from
me
by
the
comb
of
a
wave
and
then
a
following
wave
would
souse
into
my
face
and
go
clean
over
me
but
as
my
one
thought
was
to
be
hidden
from
the
lugger
i
rather
welcomed
a
buffet
of
that
sort
i
very
soon
touched
bottom
for
the
water
near
the
beach
is
shallow
i
stood
up
and
bent
over
so
as
not
to
be
seen
and
began
to
stumble
towards
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
the
business
of
lading
the
horses
was
going
steadily
forward
with
the
same
noisy
hurry
i
climbed
out
of
the
backwash
of
the
last
breaker
and
dipped
down
behind
a
rock
high
and
dry
on
the
sands
i
was
safe
i
thought
safe
at
last
and
i
was
too
glad
at
heart
to
think
of
my
sopping
clothes
and
of
the
cold
which
already
made
me
shiver
like
an
aspen
suddenly
from
up
the
hill
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
me
came
the
of
an
owl
the
smuggler
danger
signal
the
noise
upon
the
beach
ceased
at
once
the
torches
plunged
into
the
sand
and
went
out
i
heard
the
lugger
crew
cut
their
cables
and
hoist
sail
a
voice
said
carry
on
boys
the
preventives
are
safe
at
bolt
tail
and
at
that
the
noise
broke
out
as
before
some
one
cried
sh
and
still
and
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
of
the
owl
called
again
with
a
little
flourishing
note
at
the
end
of
the
call
a
man
cried
out
mount
and
scatter
some
one
else
cried
where
marah
and
as
i
lay
crouched
some
one
bent
over
me
and
touched
me
sorry
jim
said
marah
voice
i
knew
you
try
it
you
only
got
your
clothes
wet
come
on
now
went
the
owl
again
and
at
this
the
third
summons
we
distinctly
heard
many
horses
hoofs
coming
at
a
gallop
towards
us
though
at
a
considerable
distance
marah
come
on
man
cried
several
voices
come
on
said
marah
dragging
me
to
the
horses
off
boys
he
called
scatter
as
you
ride
many
horses
moved
off
at
a
smart
trot
up
the
hill
to
stoke
fleming
their
horses
feet
were
muffled
with
felt
so
that
they
made
little
noise
although
they
were
many
marah
swung
me
up
into
the
saddle
of
one
of
the
three
horses
in
his
care
he
himself
rode
the
middle
horse
i
was
on
his
off
side
the
horse
i
mounted
had
a
keg
of
spirits
lashed
to
the
saddle
behind
me
the
horse
beyond
marah
was
laden
like
a
we
the
rearguard
said
marah
to
me
we
must
bring
them
clear
off
ride
boys
strete
road
he
called
and
the
smugglers
of
the
rearguard
clattered
off
by
the
back
road
or
broken
disused
lane
which
leads
to
allington
still
marah
waited
the
only
smuggler
now
left
on
the
beach
the
preventive
officers
were
clattering
down
the
hill
to
us
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
it
the
preventives
right
enough
he
said
as
a
gust
of
wind
brought
the
clatter
of
sabres
to
us
above
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
we
in
for
a
run
some
one
been
blabbing
i
think
i
know
who
well
i
pity
him
that
what
i
pity
him
here
boy
you
ought
not
to
ha
tried
to
cut
you
be
half
frozen
with
the
wet
drink
some
of
this
he
handed
me
a
flask
and
forced
me
to
take
a
gulp
of
something
hot
it
made
me
gasp
but
it
certainly
warmed
me
and
gave
me
heart
after
my
disappointment
i
was
too
cold
and
too
broken
with
misery
to
be
frightened
of
the
preventives
i
only
prayed
that
they
might
catch
me
and
take
me
home
we
moved
slowly
to
the
meeting
of
the
roads
and
there
marah
halted
for
a
moment
our
horses
stamped
and
then
whinnied
a
horse
on
the
road
above
us
whinnied
one
of
the
clattering
troop
cried
there
they
are
we
have
them
come
along
boys
some
one
i
knew
the
voice
it
was
captain
barmoor
of
the
yeomanry
cried
out
stand
and
surrender
and
then
i
saw
the
sabres
gleam
under
the
trees
and
heard
the
horses
hoofs
grow
furious
upon
the
stones
marah
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
put
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
whistled
a
long
wailing
shrill
whistle
then
he
kicked
his
horses
and
we
started
at
a
rattling
pace
up
the
wretched
twisting
lane
which
led
to
allington
now
the
preventives
coming
downhill
at
a
tearing
gallop
could
not
take
the
sharp
turn
of
the
lane
without
pulling
up
they
got
mixed
in
some
confusion
at
the
turning
and
a
horse
and
rider
went
into
the
ditch
we
were
up
the
steep
rise
and
stretching
out
at
full
tilt
for
safety
before
they
had
cleared
the
corner
our
horses
were
fresh
theirs
had
trotted
hard
for
some
miles
under
heavy
men
so
that
at
the
first
sight
the
advantage
lay
with
us
but
their
horses
were
better
than
ours
and
in
better
trim
for
a
gallop
marah
checked
the
three
horses
and
let
them
take
it
easy
till
we
turned
into
the
high
road
which
leads
from
strete
to
my
home
here
on
the
level
he
urged
them
on
and
the
pursuit
swept
after
us
and
here
in
the
open
i
felt
for
the
first
time
the
excitement
of
the
hunt
i
wanted
to
be
caught
i
kept
praying
that
my
horse
would
come
down
or
that
the
preventives
would
catch
us
and
at
the
same
time
the
hurry
of
our
rush
through
the
night
set
my
blood
leaping
made
me
cry
aloud
as
we
galloped
made
me
call
to
the
horses
to
gallop
faster
there
was
nothing
on
the
road
no
one
was
travelling
we
had
the
highway
to
ourselves
near
the
farm
at
the
bend
we
saw
men
by
the
roadside
and
an
owl
called
to
us
from
among
them
with
that
little
flourish
at
the
end
of
the
call
which
i
had
heard
once
before
that
evening
we
dashed
past
them
but
as
marah
passed
he
cried
out
yes
be
quick
and
behind
us
as
we
sped
along
we
heard
something
dragged
across
the
road
the
crossways
lay
just
beyond
to
my
surprise
marah
never
hesitated
he
did
not
take
the
allington
road
but
spurred
uphill
towards
the
snail
castle
and
the
road
to
kingsbridge
as
we
galloped
we
heard
a
crash
behind
us
and
the
cry
of
a
hurt
horse
and
the
clatter
of
a
sword
upon
the
road
then
more
cries
sounded
we
could
hear
our
pursuers
pulling
up
they
into
a
said
marah
some
friends
put
a
tree
across
and
one
of
them
gone
into
it
we
shall
probably
lose
them
now
he
added
they
will
go
on
for
allington
still
we
must
wait
yet
indeed
the
delay
was
only
momentary
the
noise
of
the
horses
soon
behind
us
and
though
they
paused
at
the
it
was
only
for
a
few
seconds
some
of
the
troopers
took
the
allington
road
another
party
took
the
road
which
we
had
taken
and
a
third
party
stopped
i
believe
to
beat
the
farm
buildings
for
the
men
who
had
laid
the
tree
in
the
road
we
did
not
stop
to
see
what
they
were
doing
you
may
be
sure
for
when
marah
saw
that
his
trick
had
not
shaken
them
off
he
began
to
hurry
his
horses
and
we
were
soon
slipping
and
sliding
down
the
steep
zigzag
road
which
leads
past
snail
castle
i
had
some
notion
of
flinging
myself
off
my
horse
as
we
passed
the
door
or
of
checking
the
horse
i
rode
and
shouting
for
help
for
there
beyond
the
corner
was
the
house
where
i
had
been
so
happy
and
the
light
from
the
window
lying
in
a
yellow
patch
across
the
road
and
there
was
hoolie
bark
to
welcome
us
perhaps
if
i
had
not
been
wet
and
cold
i
might
have
made
an
attempt
to
get
away
and
i
knew
the
preventives
were
too
close
to
us
for
marah
to
have
lingered
had
i
done
so
but
you
must
remember
that
we
were
riding
very
fast
that
i
was
very
young
and
very
much
afraid
of
marah
and
that
the
cold
and
the
fear
of
the
preventives
for
in
a
way
i
was
horribly
frightened
by
them
had
numbed
my
brain
do
you
try
it
said
marah
grimly
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
house
do
you
try
it
he
snatched
my
rein
bending
forward
on
his
horse
neck
calling
a
wild
queer
cry
it
was
one
of
the
gipsy
and
at
the
sound
of
it
the
horses
seemed
to
lose
their
wits
for
they
dashed
forward
past
the
house
as
though
they
were
running
away
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
in
the
saddle
what
made
it
so
bitter
to
me
was
the
opening
of
the
window
behind
me
at
the
sound
of
the
cry
and
of
those
charging
horses
some
one
some
one
whom
i
knew
so
well
and
loved
so
ran
to
the
window
to
look
out
i
heard
the
latch
rattling
and
the
jarring
of
the
sash
and
i
knew
that
some
one
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
known
who
looked
out
and
saw
us
as
we
swept
round
the
corner
and
away
downhill
chapter
xiii
in
the
valley
we
turned
down
the
valley
along
the
splashing
through
the
little
stream
that
makes
it
so
boggy
by
the
gate
and
soon
we
were
on
the
galloping
along
the
straight
two
miles
towards
tor
cross
our
horses
were
beginning
to
give
way
for
we
had
done
four
miles
at
good
speed
and
now
the
preventives
began
to
gain
upon
us
looking
back
as
we
galloped
we
could
see
them
on
the
straight
road
about
two
hundred
yards
away
every
time
we
looked
back
they
seemed
to
be
nearer
and
at
last
marah
leant
across
and
told
me
to
keep
low
in
my
saddle
as
he
thought
they
were
going
to
fire
on
us
a
carbine
shot
cracked
behind
us
and
i
heard
the
zip
of
the
bullet
over
me
a
man
ran
out
suddenly
from
one
of
the
by
the
road
and
a
voice
cried
stop
them
boys
the
road
seemed
suddenly
full
of
people
who
snatched
at
our
reins
and
hit
us
with
sticks
i
got
a
shrewd
blow
over
the
knee
and
i
heard
marah
say
something
as
he
sent
one
man
spinning
to
the
ground
crack
crack
went
the
carbines
behind
us
some
one
had
hold
of
my
horse
reins
shouting
i
got
anyway
then
marah
fired
a
pistol
it
all
happened
in
a
second
the
bullet
missed
but
the
flash
scorched
my
horse
nose
the
horse
reared
and
knocked
the
man
down
and
then
we
were
clear
and
rattling
along
to
tor
cross
looking
back
we
saw
one
or
two
men
getting
up
from
the
road
and
then
guns
and
pistols
flashed
and
marah
horse
screamed
and
staggered
there
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
go
to
tor
cross
and
that
was
done
at
such
a
speed
as
i
have
never
seen
since
marah
horse
took
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
something
of
his
terror
was
in
our
horses
too
in
a
moment
as
it
seemed
we
were
past
the
houses
and
over
the
rocks
by
the
and
there
with
a
groan
marah
horse
came
down
marah
was
evidently
expecting
it
for
he
had
hold
of
my
rein
at
the
time
and
as
his
horse
fell
he
cleared
the
body
get
down
jim
he
said
we
done
the
horses
are
cooked
they
have
had
six
miles
another
mile
would
kill
them
poor
beast
heart
burst
down
with
you
he
lifted
me
off
the
saddle
and
lashed
the
two
living
horses
over
the
quarters
with
a
strip
of
seaweed
he
patted
the
dead
horse
with
a
poor
boy
and
dragged
me
down
behind
one
of
the
black
rocks
which
crop
up
there
above
the
shingle
the
two
horses
bolted
off
along
the
strand
scattering
the
pebbles
and
then
while
the
clash
of
their
hoofs
was
still
loud
upon
the
stones
the
preventives
came
pounding
up
their
horses
all
badly
blown
and
much
distressed
their
leader
was
captain
barmoor
i
knew
him
by
his
voice
here
a
dead
horse
he
cried
sergeant
we
have
one
of
their
horses
get
down
and
see
if
there
any
contraband
upon
him
after
them
you
others
we
shall
get
them
now
ride
on
i
tell
you
what
are
you
pulling
up
for
the
other
preventives
crashed
on
over
the
shingle
captain
barmoor
and
the
sergeant
remained
by
the
dead
horse
marah
and
i
lay
close
under
the
rock
hardly
daring
to
breathe
and
wondering
very
much
whether
we
made
any
visible
mark
to
the
tall
man
on
his
horse
shots
rang
out
from
the
preventives
carbines
and
the
gallopers
made
a
great
clash
upon
the
stones
we
heard
the
sergeant
saddle
creak
only
a
few
yards
away
and
then
his
boots
crunched
on
the
beach
as
he
walked
up
to
the
dead
horse
no
there
be
no
tubs
here
sir
he
said
after
a
short
examination
her
be
dead
enough
stone
dead
sir
there
an
empty
master
oh
said
captain
barmoor
any
saddlebag
or
anything
of
that
kind
the
man
fumbled
about
in
the
gear
no
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
nothing
at
all
bring
on
the
saddle
said
the
captain
there
may
be
papers
stitched
in
it
we
heard
the
sergeant
unbuckling
the
girth
by
the
way
said
the
captain
you
sure
the
third
horse
was
led
yes
said
the
sergeant
two
and
a
led
horse
there
was
sir
h
said
the
captain
i
wonder
if
they
have
dismounted
they
might
have
look
about
among
the
rocks
there
i
saw
marah
right
hand
raise
his
as
the
sergeant
stepped
nearer
in
another
moment
he
must
have
seen
us
if
he
had
even
looked
down
he
could
not
have
failed
to
see
us
but
he
stood
within
six
feet
of
us
looking
all
round
him
looking
anywhere
but
at
his
feet
then
he
walked
away
from
us
and
looked
at
the
rocks
near
the
brook
d
see
them
snapped
the
captain
no
sir
nothin
of
they
be
about
here
sir
i
think
ridden
on

i
look
in
the
furze
there
sir
afore
we
go
no
said
the
captain
well
yes
just
take
a
squint
through
it
but
as
the
sergeant
waddled
uneasily
in
his
across
the
shingle
the
carbines
of
the
preventives
cracked
out
in
a
volley
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
a
shot
or
two
followed
the
volley
a
shotgun
that
last
sir
said
the
sergeant
yes
said
the
captain
come
along
there
another
come
mount
man
they
engaged
we
heard
the
sergeant
horse
squirming
about
as
the
sergeant
tried
to
mount
and
then
the
two
galloped
off
voices
sounded
close
beside
us
and
feet
moved
upon
the
sand
still
growled
marah
in
my
ear
some
one
cried
out
further
on
they
fighting
further
on
hurry
up
and
we
shall
see
it
about
a
dozen
tor
cross
men
were
hurrying
up
in
the
chance
of
seeing
a
skirmish
the
wife
of
one
of
them
old
rivers
followed
after
them
calling
to
her
man
to
come
back
i
give
it
to
if
do
come
back
come
back
i
tell
they
passed
on
rapidly
pursued
by
the
angry
woman
while
more
shots
banged
and
cracked
further
and
further
along
the
shore
we
waited
till
they
passed
out
of
hearing
and
then
marah
got
up
come
on
son
he
said
we
must
be
going
lucky
your
teeth
did
chatter
or
they
have
heard
us
i
wish
they
had
heard
us
i
cried
hotly
then
i
have
gone
home
let
me
go
marah
let
me
go
home
next
trip
jim
he
said
kindly
not
this
i
want
you
to
learn
about
life
you
will
get
mewed
up
with
them
ladies
else
and
then
you
will
never
do
anything
ah
i
said
but
if
you
do
let
me
go
i
scream
now
then
scream
scream
away
son
said
marah
calmly
there
not
many
to
hear
you
but
you
not
get
home
after
what
you
have
seen
come
on
now
he
took
me
by
the
collar
and
walked
me
swiftly
to
a
little
cove
where
one
or
two
of
the
tor
cross
fishers
kept
their
boats
i
heard
a
gun
or
two
away
in
the
distance
and
then
a
great
clatter
of
shingle
as
the
coastguards
horses
trotted
back
towards
us
with
the
led
horse
between
two
of
them
as
the
prize
of
the
night
they
did
not
hear
us
and
could
not
see
us
and
marah
took
good
care
not
to
let
me
cry
out
to
them
he
just
turned
my
face
up
to
his
and
muttered
you
just
try
it
you
try
it
son
and
i
hold
you
in
the
sea
till
you
choke
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
direction
of
the
coastguards
towards
us
and
even
if
i
had
cried
out
perhaps
they
would
never
have
heard
me
you
may
think
me
a
great
coward
to
have
given
in
in
this
way
but
few
boys
of
my
age
would
have
made
much
outcry
against
a
man
like
marah
he
made
the
heart
die
within
you
and
to
me
cold
and
wet
from
my
ducking
terrified
of
capture
in
spite
of
my
innocence
for
i
was
not
at
all
sure
that
the
smugglers
would
not
swear
that
i
had
joined
them
and
had
helped
them
in
their
fights
and
escapades
the
outlook
seemed
so
hopeless
and
full
of
misery
that
i
could
do
nothing
my
one
little
moment
of
mutiny
was
gone
my
one
little
opportunity
was
lost
had
i
made
a
dash
for
it
but
it
is
useless
to
think
in
that
way
marah
got
into
the
one
boat
which
floated
in
the
little
artificial
creek
and
thrust
me
down
into
the
stern
sheets
then
he
shoved
her
off
with
a
stretcher
the
oars
had
been
carried
to
the
fisher
house
there
were
none
in
the
boat
and
as
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
the
rocks
in
the
rather
choppy
sea
he
stepped
the
stretcher
in
the
as
a
mast
and
hoisted
his
coat
as
a
sail
he
made
rough
sheets
by
tying
a
few
yards
of
to
the
and
then
shipping
the
rudder
he
bore
away
before
the
wind
towards
the
cave
by
black
pool
we
had
not
gone
far
certainly
not
fifty
yards
when
we
saw
the
horses
of
the
coastguards
galloping
down
to
the
sea
one
of
the
horses
shying
at
the
whiteness
of
the
breaking
water
a
voice
hailed
us
boat
ahoy
it
shouted
what
are
you
doing
in
the
boat
there
and
then
all
the
horsemen
drew
up
in
a
clump
among
the
rocks
us
be
drifting
master
shouted
marah
speaking
in
the
broad
dialect
of
the
devon
men
us
be
drifting
come
in
till
i
have
a
look
at
you
cried
the
voice
again
row
in
to
the
rocks
here
us
no
shouted
marah
letting
the
boat
slip
on
lie
down
son
he
said
they
will
fire
in
another
minute
indeed
we
heard
the
ramrods
in
the
carbines
and
the
loud
click
of
the
boat
ahoy
cried
the
voice
again
row
in
at
once
d
hear
row
in
at
once
or
i
shall
fire
on
you
marah
did
not
answer
present
arms
cried
the
voice
again
after
a
pause
and
at
that
marah
bowed
down
in
the
stern
sheets
under
the
gunwale
fire
said
the
voice
and
a
volley
ripped
up
the
sea
all
round
us
knocking
off
splinters
from
the
plank
and
flattening
out
against
the
transom
keep
down
jim
you
all
right
said
marah
we
will
be
out
of
range
in
another
minute
bang
came
a
second
volley
and
then
single
guns
cracked
and
banged
at
intervals
as
we
drew
away
for
the
next
we
were
just
within
extreme
range
of
the
carbines
and
musketoons
during
that
we
were
slowly
slipping
by
the
long
two
miles
of
slapton
sands
we
could
not
go
fast
for
our
only
sail
was
a
coat
and
though
the
wind
was
pretty
fresh
the
set
of
the
tide
was
against
us
so
for
half
an
hour
we
crouched
below
that
rowboat
gunwale
just
peeping
up
now
and
then
to
see
the
white
line
of
the
breakers
on
the
sand
and
beyond
that
the
black
outlines
of
the
horsemen
who
slowly
followed
us
firing
steadily
but
with
no
very
clear
view
of
what
they
fired
at
i
thought
that
the
two
miles
would
never
end
sometimes
the
guns
would
stop
for
a
minute
and
i
would
think
ah
now
we
are
out
of
range
or
now
they
have
given
us
up
and
then
in
another
second
another
volley
would
rattle
at
us
and
perhaps
a
bullet
would
go
whining
overhead
or
a
heavy
chewed
slug
would
come
plob
into
the
boat
side
within
six
inches
of
me
marah
did
seem
to
mind
their
firing
he
was
too
pleased
at
having
led
the
preventives
away
from
the
main
body
of
the
to
mind
a
few
bullets
ah
jim
he
said
there
three
thousand
pounds
in
lace
brandy
and
tobacco
gone
to
dartmoor
this
night
and
all
them
redcoat
fellers
got
was
a
dead
horse
and
a
horse
with
a
on
him
and
the
dead
horse
was
their
own
the
one
they
took
i
stole
out
of
the
barrack
stables
myself
but
is
a
capital
offence
i
cried
they
could
hang
you
yes
he
said
so
they
would
if
they
could
bang
came
another
volley
of
bullets
all
round
us
they
shoot
us
too
if
they
could
so
far
as
that
goes
but
so
far
they
have
been
able
never
cross
any
rivers
till
you
come
to
the
water
jim
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
you
i
have
often
thought
of
it
since
as
sound
advice
and
i
have
always
tried
to
act
upon
it
but
at
the
time
it
did
give
much
comfort
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
we
were
clear
of
slapton
sands
and
coming
near
to
strete
and
here
even
marah
began
to
be
uneasy
he
was
watching
the
horsemen
on
the
beach
very
narrowly
for
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
lea
they
had
stopped
firing
on
us
and
had
gone
at
a
gallop
to
the
beach
boathouse
to
get
out
a
boat
what
are
they
doing
marah
i
asked
getting
out
a
boat
to
come
after
us
he
answered
silly
fools
if
they
done
that
at
once
they
have
got
us
they
may
do
it
now
there
goes
the
boat
we
heard
the
cries
of
the
men
as
the
boat
ground
over
the
shingle
then
we
heard
shouts
and
cries
and
saw
a
light
in
the
boathouse
looking
for
oars
and
sails
said
marah
and
there
are
none
good
there
are
none
happily
for
us
there
were
none
but
we
heard
a
couple
of
horses
go
clattering
up
the
road
to
cottage
to
get
them
we
shall
get
away
now
said
marah
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
beach
then
one
of
the
strange
coast
currents
caught
us
and
swept
us
along
finely
for
a
few
minutes
soon
our
boat
was
in
the
cave
snugly
lashed
to
the
and
marah
had
lifted
me
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
where
a
few
smugglers
lay
in
their
hammocks
sleeping
heavily
marah
made
me
drink
something
and
eat
some
pigeon
pie
and
then
stripping
my
clothes
from
me
he
rubbed
me
down
with
a
blanket
wrapped
me
in
a
pile
of
blankets
and
laid
me
to
sleep
in
a
corner
on
an
old
sail
chapter
xiv
a
traitor
the
next
day
when
i
woke
a
number
of
smugglers
had
come
back
from
their
ride
they
were
sitting
about
the
cave
in
their
muddy
clothes
in
high
good
spirits
they
had
been
chased
by
a
few
preventives
as
far
as
allington
and
there
they
had
had
a
brisk
skirmish
with
the
allington
police
roused
by
the
preventives
carbine
fire
they
had
beaten
off
their
opponents
and
had
reached
dartmoor
in
safety
yes
said
marah
all
very
well
but
we
have
been
blabbed
on
we
had
the
cutter
on
us
on
our
way
out
and
here
we
were
surprised
coming
home
it
was
the
salcombe
cutter
chased
us
and
it
was
the
salcombe
boys
gave
the
preventives
the
tip
last
night
otherwise
they
have
been
in
salcombe
all
last
night
watching
bolt
tail
no
less
of
that
they
came
lumbering
here
and
jolly
near
nabbed
us
now
one
of
us
there
no
one
outside
knows
anything
and
only
in
salcombe
knew
our
plans
salcombe
district
supplies
north
devon
we
supply
to
the
east
more
who
could
it
be
boys
some
said
one
thing
some
another
and
then
a
man
suggested
the
parson
and
when
he
said
that
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
he
meant
mr
cottier
for
i
knew
that
sailors
always
called
a
schoolmaster
a
parson
and
i
remembered
how
mrs
cottier
had
heard
his
voice
among
the
on
the
night
of
the
just
before
christmas
no
it
could
be
the
parson
said
some
one
no
one
trusts
the
parson
i
do
know
as
it
could
be
said
the
man
whom
they
called
hankie
he
is
a
proper
cunning
one
to
pry
out
ah
said
another
smuggler
and
come
to
think
of
it
we
passed
him
the
afternoon
afore
we
sailed
i
was
driving
with
the
captain
i
was
driving
the
captain
here
from
kingsbridge
he
knows
the
captain
said
marah
grimly
he
might
have
guessed
seeing
him
with
you
that
you
were
coming
to
arrange
a
run
now
how
would
he
know
where
we
were
bound
guessed
it
said
hankie
he
been
on
a
run
or
two
with
the
salcombe
fellers
besides
he
could
be
far
out
no
said
marah
musingly
he
could
and
a
hint
would
have
been
enough
to
send
the
cutter
after
us
but
how
did
he
put
them
on
us
last
night
said
another
smuggler
we
had
drawed
them
out
proper
to
bolt
tail
to
look
for
a
cargo
there
properly
we
had
drawed
them
us
had
a
boat
and
all
showing
lights
well
if
it
was
the
parson
who
done
it
he
easily
find
a
way
said
marah
we
had
better
go
over
and
see
about
it
before
they
went
they
left
me
in
charge
of
the
old
italian
man
who
taught
me
how
to
point
a
rope
which
is
one
of
the
prettiest
kinds
of
plaiting
ever
invented
the
day
passed
slowly
oh
so
slowly
for
a
day
like
that
so
near
home
yet
so
far
away
and
with
so
much
misery
in
prospect
was
agonising
i
wondered
what
they
would
do
to
mr
cottier
i
wondered
if
ever
i
should
get
home
again
i
wondered
whether
the
coastguards
would
have
sufficient
sense
to
arrest
marah
if
they
saw
him
on
the
roads
in
wondering
like
this
the
day
slowly
dragged
to
an
end
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
just
before
a
watery
sunset
marah
and
the
others
returned
leading
mr
cottier
as
their
prisoner
it
shows
you
what
power
the
had
in
those
days
they
had
gone
to
salcombe
to
mr
cottier
lodgings
they
had
questioned
him
perhaps
with
threats
till
he
had
confessed
that
he
had
betrayed
them
to
the
preventives
then
they
had
gagged
him
hustled
him
downstairs
to
a
waiting
closed
carriage
and
then
they
had
quietly
driven
him
on
undisturbed
to
their
fastness
in
the
cliff
it
was
sad
to
see
a
man
fallen
so
low
a
man
who
had
been
at
the
university
and
master
of
a
school
it
was
sad
to
see
him
his
flabby
face
all
fallen
in
and
white
from
excess
of
fear
and
to
see
his
eyes
lolling
about
from
one
to
another
man
trying
to
find
a
little
hope
in
the
look
of
the
faces
in
the
cave
well
he
said
surlily
at
last
you
have
got
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
what
d
think
you
deserve
said
marah
eh
you
have
had
us
all
hanged
and
glad
too
you
see
soon
enough
what
we
going
to
do
to
you
he
struck
a
light
for
his
pipe
and
lit
a
candle
in
a
corner
of
the
cave
near
where
i
lay
you
soon
know
fate
he
added
meanwhile
here
a
friend
of
yours
one
you
might
like
to
talk
to
you
not
get
another
chance
at
this
the
man
grovelled
on
the
cave
floor
crying
out
to
them
to
let
him
live
that
he
would
give
them
all
his
money
and
so
on
get
up
said
marah
get
up
try
and
act
like
a
man
even
if
you
are
one
the
man
went
on
wailing
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
spike
your
guns
said
marah
curtly
there
your
friend
in
the
corner
talk
to
him
he
left
us
together
in
the
cave
an
armed
smuggler
sat
at
the
cave
entrance
turning
his
quid
meditatively
mr
cottier
i
said
do
you
remember
jim
jim
davis
jim
cried
mr
cottier
jim
how
did
you
come
here
by
accident
i
said
and
now
i
a
prisoner
here
like
you
oh
jim
he
cried
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
me
you
must
have
heard
them
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
me
will
they
kill
me
jim
i
thought
of
the
two
coastguards
snugly
shut
up
in
france
in
one
of
the
inns
near
brest
living
at
till
the
smugglers
thought
they
could
be
sure
of
them
when
i
thought
of
those
two
men
i
felt
that
the
traitor
would
not
be
killed
and
yet
i
was
not
sure
i
believe
they
would
have
killed
him
if
i
had
not
been
there
they
were
a
very
rough
lot
living
rough
lives
and
a
traitor
put
them
all
in
peril
of
the
gallows
smugglers
were
not
merciful
to
traitors
it
is
said
that
they
once
tied
a
traitor
to
a
post
at
mark
and
let
the
tide
drown
him
and
marah
words
made
me
feel
that
mr
cottier
would
suffer
some
punishment
not
death
perhaps
but
something
terrible
i
tried
to
reassure
the
man
but
i
could
say
very
little
and
i
was
angry
with
him
for
he
never
asked
after
his
wife
nor
after
hugh
his
son
and
he
asked
me
nothing
of
my
prospects
the
thought
of
his
possible
death
by
violence
within
the
next
few
hours
kept
him
from
all
thought
of
other
people
do
not
blame
him
we
who
have
not
been
tried
do
not
know
how
we
should
behave
in
similar
circumstances
the
men
came
back
to
us
we
were
led
downstairs
and
put
aboard
the
lugger
then
the
boat
pushed
off
silently
sail
was
hoisted
and
a
course
was
set
down
channel
under
a
press
of
canvas
mr
cottier
cheered
up
when
we
had
passed
out
of
the
sight
of
the
lights
of
the
shore
for
he
knew
then
that
his
life
was
to
be
spared
his
natural
bullying
vein
came
back
to
him
he
sang
and
joked
and
even
threatened
his
captors
so
all
that
night
we
sailed
and
all
the
next
day
and
night
a
wild
two
or
three
days
sailing
with
spray
flying
over
us
and
no
really
dry
or
warm
place
to
sleep
in
save
a
little
which
they
rigged
in
the
bows
i
should
have
been
very
miserable
had
not
marah
made
me
work
with
the
men
hauling
the
ropes
swabbing
down
the
decks
scrubbing
the
paintwork
and
even
bearing
a
hand
at
the
tiller
the
work
kept
me
from
thinking
the
watches
four
hours
on
four
hours
off
which
i
had
to
keep
like
the
other
men
made
the
time
pass
rapidly
for
the
days
slid
into
each
other
and
the
nights
broken
into
as
they
were
by
the
seemed
all
too
short
for
a
sleepy
head
like
mine
towards
the
end
of
the
passage
when
the
weather
had
grown
brighter
and
hotter
i
began
to
wonder
how
much
further
we
were
going
then
one
morning
i
woke
up
to
find
the
lugger
at
anchor
in
one
of
the
ports
of
northern
spain
with
dawn
just
breaking
over
the
and
one
or
two
large
boats
xebecs
from
africa
lying
close
to
us
one
of
them
was
flying
a
red
flag
and
i
noticed
that
our
own
boat
was
alongside
of
her
i
thought
nothing
of
it
but
drew
a
little
water
from
the
and
washed
my
face
and
hands
in
one
of
the
buckets
one
or
two
of
the
men
were
talking
at
my
side
ah
said
one
of
them
that
nine
he
did
that
way
nine
counting
him
a
good
job
too
said
another
man
it
us
or
them
i
rather
it
was
them
yes
said
another
fellow
and
i
guess
they
repent
the
others
laughed
a
harsh
laugh
turning
to
the
african
boat
with
curious
faces
to
watch
our
boat
pulling
back
with
marah
at
her
steering
oar
i
noticed
at
breakfast
which
we
all
ate
together
on
the
deck
that
mr
cottier
was
no
longer
aboard
the
lugger
i
had
some
queer
misgivings
but
said
nothing
till
afterwards
when
i
found
marah
alone
marah
i
said
where
is
mr
cottier
what
have
you
done
to
him
he
grinned
at
me
grimly
as
though
he
were
going
to
refuse
to
tell
me
then
he
beckoned
me
to
the
side
of
the
boat
here
he
said
pointing
to
the
xebec
you
see
that
yes
i
said
well
then
marah
continued
he
aboard
her
down
in
her
hold
tied
somewhere
on
the
ballast
that
where
mr
cottier
is
now
you
want
to
know
what
we
have
done
to
him
hey
well
we
enlisted
him
in
the
spanish
navy
that
is
what
they
call
a
tender
they
carry
recruits
to
the
navy
in
them
boats
he
will
be
in
a
spanish
by
this
time
next
week
they
give
him
twenty
dollars
to
buy
a
uniform
he
about
ripe
for
the
spanish
navy
but
marah
i
cried
he
may
have
to
fight
against
our
ships
all
the
better
for
us
he
answered
i
wish
all
our
enemies
were
as
easy
jobs
i
could
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
i
asked
if
he
would
ever
get
free
again
i
could
get
free
again
said
marah
but
that
man
is
like
me
he
enlisted
for
three
years
i
doubt
the
war
will
last
so
long
the
free
trade
will
be
done
by
the
time
he
discharged
you
see
jim
we
can
only
make
a
little
while
the
nations
are
fighting
by
this
time
three
years
mr
cottier
can
talk
all
he
a
mind
i
had
never
liked
mr
cottier
but
i
felt
a
sort
of
pity
for
him
then
i
felt
that
perhaps
the
discipline
would
be
the
making
of
him
and
that
if
he
kept
steady
he
might
even
rise
in
the
spanish
navy
since
he
was
a
man
of
education
then
i
thought
of
poor
mrs
cottier
at
home
and
i
felt
that
her
husband
must
be
saved
at
all
costs
oh
marah
i
cried
do
let
him
go
like
that
go
and
buy
him
back
he
does
deserve
to
end
like
that
rot
said
marah
turning
on
his
heel
hands
up
anchor
forward
to
the
windlass
jim
you
know
your
duty
the
men
ran
to
their
places
very
soon
we
were
under
sail
again
out
at
sea
with
the
spanish
coast
in
the
distance
astern
a
line
of
bluish
hills
almost
like
clouds
chapter
xv
the
battle
on
the
shore
we
had
rough
weather
on
the
passage
north
so
that
we
were
forced
to
go
slowly
creeping
from
port
to
port
from
bayonne
to
fecamp
always
in
dread
of
boats
of
the
english
frigates
which
patrolled
the
whole
coast
keeping
the
french
merchantmen
shut
up
in
harbour
as
we
stole
slowly
to
the
north
i
thought
of
nothing
but
the
new
spanish
sailor
he
would
be
living
on
crusts
so
the
smugglers
told
me
and
always
he
would
have
an
overseer
to
prod
him
with
a
knife
if
in
a
moment
of
sickness
or
weariness
he
faltered
in
his
work
no
matter
how
hard
it
might
be
but
by
this
time
i
had
learned
that
the
smugglers
loved
to
frighten
me
i
know
now
that
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
any
of
the
tales
they
told
me
at
etaples
we
were
delayed
for
nearly
a
fortnight
waiting
first
of
all
for
cargo
and
then
for
a
fair
wind
there
were
two
other
smugglers
luggers
at
etaples
with
us
they
were
both
waiting
for
the
wind
to
draw
to
the
south
or
southeast
so
that
they
could
dash
across
to
romney
sands
as
they
had
more
cargo
than
they
could
stow
they
induced
marah
to
help
them
by
carrying
their
surplus
they
were
a
whole
day
arguing
about
it
before
they
came
to
terms
but
it
ended
as
we
all
knew
that
it
would
end
by
marah
giving
the
other
captains
drink
and
leading
them
thus
to
give
him
whatever
terms
he
asked
the
other
smugglers
in
our
boat
were
not
very
eager
to
work
with
strangers
but
marah
talked
them
over
only
old
gateo
would
not
listen
to
him
something
bad
will
come
of
it
he
kept
saying
you
mark
what
i
say
something
bad
will
come
of
it
then
marah
would
heave
a
at
him
and
tell
him
to
hold
his
jaw
and
the
old
man
would
mutter
over
his
quid
and
say
that
we
should
see
we
loaded
our
lugger
with
contraband
goods
mostly
lace
and
brandy
an
extremely
valuable
cargo
the
work
of
loading
kept
the
men
from
thinking
about
gateo
warnings
though
like
most
sailors
they
were
all
very
superstitious
then
some
french
merchants
gave
us
a
dinner
at
the
inn
to
wish
us
a
good
voyage
and
to
put
new
spirit
into
us
by
telling
us
what
good
fellows
we
were
but
the
dinner
was
never
finished
for
before
they
had
begun
their
speeches
a
smuggler
came
in
to
say
that
the
wind
had
shifted
and
that
it
was
now
breezing
up
from
the
southeast
so
we
left
our
plates
just
as
they
were
the
men
rose
up
from
their
chairs
drank
whatever
was
in
their
cups
at
the
moment
and
marched
out
of
the
inn
in
a
body
to
me
it
seemed
bitterly
cold
outside
the
inn
i
shivered
till
my
teeth
chattered
marah
asked
me
if
i
had
a
touch
of
fever
or
if
i
were
ill
or
what
was
it
anyway
that
made
me
shiver
so
i
said
that
i
was
cold
cold
he
said
cold
why
it
one
of
the
hottest
nights
we
have
had
this
summer
here
a
youngster
says
he
cold
one
or
two
of
them
laughed
at
me
then
for
it
was
indeed
a
hot
night
they
laughed
and
chaffed
together
as
they
cast
off
the
mooring
ropes
for
my
part
i
felt
that
my
sudden
chilly
fit
was
a
warning
that
there
was
trouble
coming
i
ca
say
why
i
felt
that
but
i
felt
it
and
i
believe
that
marah
in
some
way
felt
it
too
almost
the
last
thing
i
saw
that
night
as
i
made
up
my
bed
under
the
among
a
few
sacks
and
bolts
of
canvas
was
marah
scowling
and
muttering
as
though
uneasy
at
the
foot
of
the
foremast
from
which
he
watched
the
other
luggers
as
they
worked
out
of
the
river
ahead
of
us
he
too
feels
uneasy
i
said
to
myself
then
i
fell
into
a
troubled
doze
full
of
dreams
of
which
flapped
and
screamed
at
me
from
the
foam
of
the
breaking
seas
i
was
not
called
for
a
watch
that
night
in
the
early
morning
between
one
and
two
i
was
awakened
by
a
feeling
that
something
was
about
to
happen
i
sat
up
and
then
crept
out
on
to
the
deck
and
there
sure
enough
something
was
about
to
happen
our
sails
were
down
we
were
hardly
moving
through
the
water
the
water
gurgled
and
plowtered
under
our
keel
there
was
a
light
mist
fast
fading
before
the
wind
it
was
not
very
dark
in
fact
it
was
almost
twilight
one
or
two
stars
were
shining
there
were
clouds
slowly
moving
over
them
but
the
sky
astern
of
us
was
grey
and
faint
yellow
and
the
land
the
kentish
coast
lay
clear
before
us
with
the
nose
of
dungeness
away
on
our
port
bow
it
was
all
very
still
and
beautiful
the
seamen
moved
to
and
fro
about
the
lugger
dew
dripped
from
our
rigging
the
decks
were
wet
with
dew
the
drops
pattered
down
whenever
the
lugger
rolled
the
other
boats
lay
near
us
both
of
them
to
starboard
their
sails
were
doused
in
masses
under
the
mast
i
could
see
men
moving
about
i
could
hear
the
creaking
of
the
blocks
as
the
light
roll
drew
a
rope
over
a
sheave
the
boats
were
not
very
close
to
the
shore
but
it
was
so
still
so
very
peaceful
that
we
could
hear
the
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
with
a
noise
of
hushing
and
of
slipping
shingle
as
each
wave
passed
with
a
hiss
to
slither
back
in
a
rush
of
foam
broken
by
tiny
stones
a
man
in
the
bows
of
the
middle
lugger
showed
a
red
lantern
and
then
doused
it
below
the
he
showed
it
three
times
and
at
the
third
showing
we
all
turned
to
the
shore
to
see
what
signal
the
red
light
would
bring
the
shore
was
open
before
us
in
the
rapidly
growing
light
we
could
make
out
a
good
deal
of
the
lie
of
the
land
from
the
northern
end
of
the
beach
an
answering
red
light
flashed
and
then
nearer
to
us
a
dark
body
was
seen
for
a
moment
kindling
two
green
fires
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
our
men
were
not
given
to
nervousness
they
were
rough
tough
sailors
but
they
were
all
relieved
when
our
signals
were
answered
it
them
they
said
it
all
right
up
with
the
foresail
we
must
get
the
stuff
ashore
it
be
dawn
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
shall
have
the
country
on
us
heave
ahead
boys
cried
one
of
the
men
in
the
next
lugger
as
she
drove
past
us
to
the
shore
ay
heave
ahead
said
marah
eyeing
the
coast
he
took
the
tiller
as
the
lugger
gathered
way
under
her
hoisted
foresail
while
we
slipped
nearer
to
the
white
line
of
the
breakers
along
the
sand
he
muttered
under
his
breath
i
was
standing
just
beside
him
in
a
way
which
frightened
me
i
dunno
he
said
aloud
but
i
a
feeling
that
there
going
to
be
trouble
i
never
liked
this
job
here
it
is
almost
daylight
and
not
an
ounce
of
stuff
ashore
i
never
have
come
this
trip
if
the
freights
had
been
so
good
here
you
he
cried
suddenly
to
one
of
the
men
do
you
pass
the
gaskets
you
furl
no
sails
till
home
my
son
pass
the
halliards
along
so
that
you
can
hoist
in
a
jiffy
then
he
hailed
the
other
luggers
ahoy
there
he
called
you
mind
your
eyes
for
trouble
his
words
caused
some
laughter
in
the
other
boats
in
our
boat
they
caused
the
men
to
look
around
at
marah
almost
anxiously
he
laughed
and
told
them
to
stand
by
then
we
saw
that
the
beach
was
crowded
with
men
and
horses
as
at
black
pool
a
week
or
two
before
in
the
shallow
water
near
the
beach
we
dropped
our
killick
the
men
from
the
beach
waded
out
to
us
our
own
men
slipped
over
the
side
the
tubs
and
bales
began
to
pass
along
the
lines
of
men
to
the
men
in
charge
of
the
horses
only
one
word
was
spoken
the
word
hurry
at
every
moment
as
it
seemed
to
me
full
as
i
was
of
anxiety
the
land
showed
more
clearly
the
trees
stood
out
more
sharply
against
the
sky
the
light
in
the
east
became
more
like
a
flame
hurry
said
marah
it
be
dawn
in
a
tick
hurry
was
the
watchword
of
the
crews
the
men
worked
with
a
will
tub
after
tub
was
passed
along
now
and
then
we
heard
a
splash
and
an
oath
then
a
horse
would
whinny
upon
the
beach
startled
by
a
wave
and
a
man
would
tell
him
to
stand
back
or
woa
yer
i
caught
the
excitement
and
handed
out
the
tubs
with
the
best
of
them
i
suppose
that
we
worked
in
this
way
for
half
an
hour
or
a
little
more
the
men
had
worked
well
at
black
pool
where
the
run
had
been
timed
to
end
in
darkness
now
that
they
had
to
race
the
daylight
they
worked
like
slaves
under
an
overseer
one
string
of
horses
trotted
off
fully
loaded
within
twenty
minutes
a
second
string
was
led
down
in
the
growing
light
i
could
see
them
stamping
and
tossing
they
were
backed
right
down
into
the
sea
so
that
the
water
washed
upon
their
hocks
here
jim
said
marah
suddenly
stopping
me
in
my
work
come
here
to
me
look
here
he
said
when
i
stood
before
him
it
getting
too
light
for
this
game
we
may
have
to
cut
and
run
take
this
hatchet
here
and
go
forward
to
the
bows
when
i
say
you
cut
without
looking
round
cut
the
cable
see
cut
it
in
two
mucho
pronto
and
you
hankin
you
gateo
stand
by
the
halliards
stretch
them
along
ready
to
hoist
no
hoist
them
do
wait
hoist
them
now
one
or
two
others
lent
their
hands
at
the
halliards
and
the
sails
were
hoisted
the
men
in
the
other
luggers
laughed
and
jeered
what
are
you
hoisting
sail
for
they
cried
of
a
forenoon
cried
another
perhaps
a
deserter
from
the
navy
shut
up
marah
answered
do
mind
them
boys
heave
round
heave
round
at
what
you
doing
over
with
them
tubs
sons
my
hat
those
fellows
are
mad
to
be
playing
this
game
in
a
light
like
this
a
fort
within
three
miles
of
us
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
one
of
the
men
at
the
side
of
the
lugger
suddenly
looked
towards
the
beach
as
though
he
had
caught
sight
of
something
something
up
he
said
sharply
the
beach
and
the
shore
beyond
were
both
very
flat
in
that
part
nothing
but
marshy
land
overgrown
with
and
a
few
covered
with
bents
it
was
not
a
country
which
could
give
much
cover
to
an
enemy
but
in
that
one
could
not
distinguish
very
clearly
and
an
enemy
could
therefore
take
risks
impossible
in
full
day
a
lot
of
cattle
there
said
the
smuggler
who
had
spoken
it
odd
there
being
so
many
do
you
graze
many
cattle
here
said
marah
looking
ashore
what
in
the
marsh
said
the
man
not
much
them
no
cattle
said
marah
after
a
pause
them
not
cows
them
horses
sure
they
horses
yes
and
there
men
mounting
them
they
have
crawled
up
leading
their
horses
and
now
we
done
look
out
boys
he
shouted
look
out
get
on
board
even
as
he
spoke
the
whole
shore
seemed
to
bristle
with
cavalry
each
slowly
moving
horse
stopped
a
moment
for
his
rider
to
mount
there
were
fifty
or
sixty
of
them
they
seemed
to
spread
all
along
the
edge
of
the
bay
except
at
the
northern
end
where
the
line
was
not
quite
closed
sentries
asleep
said
mafah
this
is
the
way
they
carry
on
in
kent
yes
there
the
sentry
asleep
on
the
oh
yes
time
to
wake
up
it
is
you
mahon
ape
look
at
him
we
saw
the
sentry
leap
to
his
feet
almost
under
the
nose
of
a
horse
he
was
too
much
surprised
even
to
fire
his
pistol
he
just
jumped
up
all
dazed
holding
up
his
hands
to
show
that
he
surrendered
we
saw
two
men
on
foot
secure
his
hands
that
was
our
first
loss
it
all
happened
very
very
quickly
we
were
taken
by
surprise
all
unready
with
our
men
ashore
or
mixed
among
the
horses
or
carrying
tubs
in
the
water
the
troops
and
preventives
were
over
the
last
dune
and
galloping
down
the
sand
to
us
almost
before
marah
had
finished
speaking
yet
even
then
in
all
the
confusion
as
a
captain
shouted
to
us
to
surrender
in
the
name
of
the
king
the
smugglers
were
not
without
resource
a
young
man
in
a
blue
scotch
bonnet
jumped
on
one
of
the
horses
snatching
another
horse
by
the
rein
others
did
the
same
the
second
string
started
as
they
were
up
the
sand
and
away
at
full
gallop
for
the
north
end
of
the
bay
where
no
soldiers
showed
as
yet
it
was
done
in
an
instant
of
time
drilled
horsemen
could
not
have
done
it
the
little
man
in
the
blue
bonnet
saw
the
one
loophole
and
dashed
for
it
there
was
no
shouting
one
or
two
men
spoke
and
then
there
it
was
done
practically
all
the
horses
were
lashing
along
the
beach
going
full
tilt
for
safety
they
galloped
in
a
body
like
a
troop
of
cavalry
two
preventives
rode
at
them
to
stop
them
but
they
rode
slap
into
the
preventives
tumbled
them
over
horse
and
man
and
then
galloped
on
not
looking
back
a
trooper
reined
in
whipped
up
his
carbine
and
fired
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
fight
then
there
came
a
general
volley
pistols
and
carbines
cracked
and
banged
a
lot
of
smoke
blew
about
the
beach
and
along
the
water
our
men
shouted
to
each
other
the
soldiers
cheered
in
another
ten
seconds
a
battle
was
going
on
in
the
water
all
round
us
the
horsemen
urged
their
horses
right
up
to
the
sides
of
the
luggers
the
men
in
the
water
hacked
at
the
horses
legs
with
their
hangers
the
horses
screamed
and
bit
i
saw
one
wounded
horse
seize
a
smuggler
by
the
arm
and
shake
him
as
a
dog
shakes
a
rat
the
rider
of
the
horse
firing
at
the
man
shot
the
horse
by
accident
through
the
head
i
suppose
he
was
too
much
excited
to
know
what
he
was
doing
i
fancy
that
men
in
a
battle
are
never
quite
sane
the
horse
fell
over
in
the
water
knocking
down
another
horse
and
then
there
was
a
lashing
in
the
sea
as
the
horse
tried
to
rise
the
smugglers
cut
at
him
in
the
sea
and
all
the
time
his
rider
was
half
under
water
trying
to
get
up
and
pulling
at
the
trigger
of
his
useless
wetted
pistol
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
was
the
strange
thing
in
one
minute
we
were
hard
at
work
at
the
tubs
in
the
next
we
were
struggling
and
splashing
hacking
at
each
other
with
swords
firing
in
each
faces
horsemen
tried
to
drag
the
lugger
towards
the
shore
but
the
men
beat
them
back
knocked
them
from
their
saddles
or
flogged
the
horses
over
the
nose
with
all
this
time
the
guns
were
banging
men
were
crying
out
horses
were
screaming
it
was
the
most
confused
thing
i
ever
saw
marah
knocked
down
a
trooper
with
a
broken
cleat
and
shouted
to
me
to
cut
the
cable
which
i
did
at
once
one
or
two
men
ran
to
trim
sail
and
marah
took
the
tiller
at
that
moment
a
trooper
rode
into
the
sea
just
astern
of
us
i
remember
to
this
day
the
brightness
of
the
splash
his
horse
made
marah
turned
at
the
noise
and
shot
the
horse
but
the
man
fired
too
and
marah
seemed
to
stagger
and
droop
over
the
tiller
as
though
badly
hit
seeing
that
i
ran
aft
to
help
him
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
ran
that
the
side
of
the
lugger
was
all
red
with
clambering
shouting
soldiers
all
of
them
firing
pistols
at
me
marah
picked
himself
up
as
i
got
there
out
of
the
way
boy
he
cried
two
or
three
smugglers
rallied
round
him
there
were
more
shots
more
cries
redcoats
came
aft
in
a
rush
someone
hit
me
a
blow
on
the
head
and
all
my
life
seemed
to
pass
from
me
in
a
stream
of
fire
out
at
my
eyes
the
last
thing
which
i
remember
of
the
tussle
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
hit
me
he
was
a
pale
man
with
wide
eyes
his
helmet
knocked
off
his
stock
loose
at
his
throat
i
just
saw
him
as
i
fell
and
then
everything
passed
from
my
sight
in
a
sound
of
roaring
like
the
roaring
of
waters
in
a
spate
chapter
xvi
drifting
when
i
recovered
consciousness
the
sun
had
risen
it
was
bright
daylight
all
about
us
that
was
really
the
first
thing
which
i
saw
the
light
of
the
sun
on
the
deck
i
struggled
up
to
a
sitting
position
feeling
great
pain
in
my
head
marah
lying
over
the
tiller
was
the
next
thing
which
i
saw
he
was
dead
i
thought
then
i
realised
what
had
happened
we
had
had
a
fight
we
were
not
under
control
we
were
drifting
with
the
tide
up
and
down
with
our
sails
backing
and
filling
up
and
down
the
deck
there
were
wounded
men
some
of
them
preventives
some
of
them
smugglers
poor
hankin
was
one
of
them
when
i
stood
up
i
saw
that
i
was
the
only
person
on
his
feet
in
the
boat
it
was
not
strange
perhaps
some
of
our
men
had
gone
with
the
horses
others
had
been
in
the
water
when
the
horsemen
first
charged
them
probably
all
of
those
who
had
been
in
the
water
were
either
killed
or
taken
we
had
had
four
men
aboard
during
the
attack
of
these
one
was
badly
hurt
another
marah
was
unconscious
the
remaining
two
were
drinking
under
the
having
opened
a
tub
of
spirits
when
i
had
stood
up
i
felt
a
little
stronger
i
heard
marah
moan
a
little
i
tottered
to
the
where
we
kept
our
drinking
water
i
splashed
the
contents
of
a
couple
of
pannikins
over
my
head
and
then
drank
about
a
pint
and
a
half
that
made
me
feel
a
different
being
i
was
then
able
to
do
something
for
the
others
first
of
all
i
managed
to
help
marah
down
from
his
perch
over
the
tiller
he
had
fallen
across
it
with
his
head
and
hands
almost
touching
the
deck
i
helped
him
or
rather
lifted
him
for
he
could
not
help
himself
to
the
deck
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
he
was
so
big
and
heavy
i
put
a
tub
under
his
head
as
a
pillow
then
i
cut
his
shirt
open
and
saw
that
he
had
been
shot
in
the
chest
i
ran
forward
with
a
pannikin
drew
some
water
and
gave
him
a
drink
he
drank
greedily
biting
the
tin
but
did
not
recognise
me
all
that
he
could
say
was
over
and
over
again
the
was
the
name
of
a
race
or
tideway
on
the
campeachy
coast
he
had
often
told
me
about
it
and
i
had
remembered
the
name
because
it
was
such
a
queer
one
i
bathed
his
wound
with
the
water
after
i
had
done
what
i
could
for
marah
i
did
the
same
for
the
wounded
soldier
he
thanked
me
for
my
trouble
in
a
little
low
weak
voice
infinitely
serious
he
seemed
to
think
that
i
did
believe
him
i
say
thank
you
thank
you
he
repeated
earnestly
and
then
he
gave
a
little
gasp
and
fainted
away
in
the
middle
of
his
thanks
at
that
i
stood
up
and
began
to
cry
i
had
had
enough
of
misery
and
that
was
more
than
i
could
bear
between
my
sobs
i
saw
i
did
not
observe
i
just
saw
that
the
lugger
was
drifting
slowly
northward
clear
of
little
stone
point
as
the
smugglers
had
called
it
i
much
care
where
we
drifted
but
having
seen
so
much
it
occurred
to
me
to
see
where
the
other
luggers
were
one
of
them
i
saw
was
on
her
course
for
france
a
couple
of
miles
away
already
the
other
was
going
for
dungeness
no
doubt
to
pick
up
more
hands
somewhere
on
the
dunge
marsh
it
was
like
them
i
thought
to
go
off
like
that
leaving
us
to
have
the
worst
of
the
fight
and
every
chance
of
being
taken
they
only
thought
of
their
own
necks
when
i
saw
that
they
had
deserted
us
without
even
pausing
to
put
a
helmsman
aboard
us
i
knew
that
there
was
no
honour
among
thieves
there
is
not
in
spite
of
what
the
proverb
says
we
were
left
alone
a
boy
two
drunkards
and
some
wounded
men
within
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
i
looked
for
the
preventives
but
i
could
not
see
them
most
of
them
had
gone
after
the
horses
across
romney
marsh
i
did
not
know
till
long
afterwards
that
the
smugglers
had
beaten
off
the
rest
of
the
party
killing
some
and
about
twenty
horses
and
wounding
nearly
every
other
man
engaged
it
had
been
in
fact
a
very
determined
battle
one
of
the
worst
ever
fought
between
the
smugglers
and
the
authorities
on
that
coast
as
soon
as
the
fight
was
over
the
luggers
got
out
from
the
shore
and
the
troops
made
off
with
their
wounded
to
report
at
the
fort
and
to
signal
the
ness
cutter
to
go
in
chase
at
the
moment
when
i
looked
for
them
they
must
i
think
have
been
rallying
again
i
could
not
see
them
that
was
enough
for
me
years
afterwards
i
talked
with
one
of
the
survivors
an
old
cavalryman
he
told
me
how
the
fight
had
seemed
to
him
as
he
rode
in
at
us
and
d
know
sir
he
said
they
had
a
boy
forward
ready
with
an
axe
to
cut
the
cable
so
i
fired
at
him
thank
you
i
thought
and
just
as
i
pulled
the
trigger
one
of
their
men
hit
my
gee
a
welt
and
down
he
came
in
the
water
and
so
of
course
i
missed
but
for
that
sir
we
have
got
them
i
wondered
which
of
the
men
had
saved
my
life
by
hitting
that
gee
a
welt
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
killed
or
taken
or
whether
he
had
got
aboard
us
afterwards
or
whether
one
of
the
other
luggers
had
saved
him
well
i
shall
never
know
on
this
side
of
the
grave
but
it
is
odd
is
it
not
that
one
should
have
one
life
saved
and
never
know
that
it
was
in
danger
till
twenty
years
afterwards
when
the
man
who
saved
it
was
never
likely
to
be
found
but
i
am
getting
away
from
my
story
i
soon
saw
that
the
current
was
slowly
setting
us
ashore
marah
with
his
great
manliness
had
steered
the
lugger
out
to
sea
for
some
six
hundred
yards
before
he
had
collapsed
then
his
fellows
seeing
him
as
they
supposed
dead
turned
to
drinking
the
lugger
left
to
herself
took
charge
and
swung
round
head
to
wind
since
then
she
had
drifted
sometimes
making
a
sometimes
going
ahead
a
little
but
nearly
always
drifting
slowly
shoreward
flogging
her
gear
making
a
great
clatter
of
blocks
if
the
soldiers
had
been
half
smart
they
would
have
seen
that
she
was
not
under
command
and
ridden
to
dymchurch
taken
boat
and
come
after
us
but
they
had
had
a
severe
beating
many
of
them
were
wounded
and
they
had
watched
our
start
feeling
that
we
had
safely
escaped
from
them
i
have
never
had
much
opinion
of
soldiers
boys
generally
take
their
opinions
ready
made
from
their
elders
i
took
mine
from
marah
who
being
a
sailor
thought
that
a
soldier
was
something
too
silly
for
words
as
we
drifted
i
went
back
to
marah
to
bathe
his
head
with
water
and
to
give
him
drink
he
was
not
conscious
he
had
even
ceased
babbling
i
was
afraid
that
he
could
not
live
for
more
than
a
few
hours
at
the
most
i
had
never
really
liked
the
man
i
had
feared
him
too
much
to
like
him
but
he
had
looked
after
me
for
so
long
and
had
been
in
his
rough
way
so
kind
to
me
that
i
cried
for
him
as
though
he
were
my
only
friend
he
was
the
only
friend
within
many
miles
of
me
and
now
he
lay
there
dying
in
a
boat
which
was
drifting
ashore
to
a
land
full
of
enemies
it
was
a
land
flat
and
desolate
dank
and
the
flat
dull
dirty
marsh
country
seemed
to
be
without
life
the
very
grass
seemed
blighted
and
we
were
drifting
ashore
to
it
fast
drifting
ashore
to
the
tune
of
the
two
drunkards
there
was
a
ship
and
a
ship
of
fame
away
ho
rise
and
shine
there
was
a
ship
and
a
ship
of
fame
so
rise
and
shine
my
buck
o
boy
a
ship
manned
by
such
a
crew
was
hardly
a
ship
of
fame
i
thought
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
she
went
ashore
i
might
escape
from
her
might
even
get
safely
home
or
at
least
get
to
london
i
had
no
notion
how
far
london
might
be
where
i
thought
that
the
lord
mayor
of
whom
i
had
often
heard
as
a
great
man
would
send
me
home
i
had
a
new
in
my
pocket
that
would
be
enough
to
keep
me
in
food
on
the
road
i
thought
and
then
just
as
i
thought
that
a
little
spun
us
in
very
rapidly
helped
by
the
wind
for
about
two
hundred
yards
this
brought
us
very
close
to
the
shore
but
not
quite
near
enough
for
me
who
had
no
great
wish
to
start
my
journey
wet
through
i
gave
marah
a
last
sip
of
water
left
a
bucket
of
fresh
water
and
a
pannikin
close
to
him
in
case
he
should
recover
i
never
thought
he
would
and
then
began
to
make
up
a
little
parcel
of
things
to
take
with
me
i
was
wearing
the
clothes
of
a
ship
boy
canvas
trousers
thick
blucher
shoes
a
rough
check
shirt
and
a
straw
hat
my
own
clothes
the
clothes
which
i
had
worn
when
i
scrambled
down
the
earth
were
forward
under
the
half
deck
i
went
to
fetch
them
and
got
them
safely
though
the
drunkards
tried
to
stop
me
and
said
that
they
only
wanted
me
to
sing
them
a
song
to
be
as
happy
as
kings
however
i
got
away
from
them
and
carried
my
belongings
aft
i
then
took
the
tarpaulin
which
covered
our
little
norwegian
pram
or
skiff
on
its
chocks
between
the
masts
it
was
rather
too
large
for
my
purpose
so
i
cut
it
in
two
using
the
one
half
as
a
the
other
half
would
make
a
sort
of
cape
or
cloak
i
thought
and
to
that
end
i
folded
it
and
slung
it
over
my
shoulder
i
gave
my
knife
a
few
turns
upon
the
grindstone
pocketed
some
twine
from
one
of
the
lockers
lashed
my
bundle
in
its
tarpaulin
as
tightly
as
i
could
and
then
went
aft
to
the
provision
lockers
to
get
some
stores
for
the
road
i
took
out
a
few
ship
biscuits
a
large
hunk
of
ham
some
onions
and
the
half
of
a
dutch
cheese
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
ought
to
eat
before
i
started
as
i
did
not
know
what
might
befall
upon
the
road
when
i
sat
down
upon
the
deck
to
begin
my
meal
i
saw
to
my
horror
that
we
were
drifting
out
again
while
i
had
been
packing
we
had
been
swept
off
shore
by
this
time
we
were
three
hundred
yards
away
still
drawing
further
out
to
sea
looking
out
i
saw
that
we
were
drifting
into
a
jobble
or
which
seemed
to
drift
obliquely
into
the
shore
this
made
me
feel
less
frightened
so
i
turned
to
my
food
ate
heartily
and
took
a
good
swig
at
the
by
way
of
a
morning
draught
then
i
undid
my
parcel
packed
as
much
food
into
it
as
i
possibly
could
and
lashed
it
up
again
in
its
tarpaulin
i
found
a
few
reins
and
straps
in
one
of
the
lockers
so
i
made
of
them
and
buckled
my
package
to
my
shoulders
my
last
preparation
was
to
fill
a
glass
flask
every
man
aboard
carries
one
or
two
of
these
just
as
i
replaced
its
stopper
we
swept
into
the
jobble
the
lugger
filled
on
one
tack
and
lay
over
and
the
spray
of
a
wave
came
over
us
then
we
righted
suddenly
came
up
into
the
wind
with
our
sails
slatting
and
made
a
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
land
the
shore
with
its
bent
grass
seemed
almost
within
catapult
shot
i
heard
the
wash
of
the
sea
upon
the
beach
i
could
see
the
pebbles
on
the
sands
shining
as
the
foam
left
them
and
then
suddenly
the
lugger
drove
ashore
upon
a
bank
stern
first
in
a
moment
she
had
swung
round
broadside
on
to
the
shoal
heaving
over
on
her
side
every
wave
which
struck
her
lifted
her
further
in
tossing
her
over
on
her
starboard
side
i
could
see
that
the
tide
was
now
very
nearly
fully
in
and
i
knew
that
the
lugger
would
lie
there
high
and
dry
as
soon
as
it
ebbed
i
made
marah
as
comfortable
as
i
could
and
called
to
the
drunkards
to
come
with
me
i
told
them
that
a
revenue
cutter
was
within
six
miles
of
us
there
was
as
it
happened
but
she
was
at
anchor
off
dymchurch
and
that
they
had
better
be
going
out
of
that
before
they
got
themselves
arrested
for
answer
they
jeered
and
made
catcalls
flinging
a
at
me
i
tried
a
second
time
to
make
them
come
ashore
but
one
of
them
said
let
do
for
him
and
the
other
cheered
the
proposal
with
loud
yells
then
they
came
lurching
aft
at
me
so
i
just
slipped
over
the
side
and
waded
very
hurriedly
ashore
the
water
was
not
deep
it
was
not
up
to
my
thighs
in
any
place
so
that
i
soon
reached
the
sand
without
wetting
my
package
then
i
looked
back
to
see
the
two
smugglers
leaning
over
the
side
watching
my
movements
one
of
them
was
singing
there
was
a
ship
and
a
ship
of
fame
away
ho
rise
and
shine
in
a
cracked
falsetto
the
other
one
was
saying
you
come
back
you
young
cub
but
i
did
not
do
as
they
bid
i
ran
up
the
beach
and
as
far
across
the
wet
grassland
as
i
could
without
once
stopping
when
i
thought
that
i
was
safe
i
sat
down
under
some
bushes
took
off
my
wet
things
and
dressed
myself
in
my
own
clothes
i
wrung
the
water
from
the
wet
canvas
repacked
my
parcel
and
seeing
a
road
close
to
me
turned
into
it
at
once
resolved
to
ask
the
way
to
london
at
the
first
house
i
suppose
that
it
was
five
in
the
morning
when
i
began
my
journey
chapter
xvii
the
blue
boar
as
i
stepped
out
the
adventure
the
fight
marah
wound
all
the
tumult
of
the
battle
seemed
very
far
away
and
as
though
they
had
happened
to
some
one
else
who
had
told
me
of
them
if
my
head
had
not
ached
so
cruelly
from
the
blow
which
the
soldier
gave
me
i
should
not
have
believed
that
they
had
really
occurred
and
that
i
had
seen
them
and
taken
part
in
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
close
to
my
home
that
i
should
soon
come
to
the
combe
country
where
the
gara
runs
down
the
valley
to
the
sea
passing
the
slate
quarry
so
grey
against
the
copse
the
road
was
good
enough
though
i
was
not
in
good
trim
for
walking
after
so
many
days
cooped
up
in
the
lugger
i
stepped
forward
bravely
along
a
lonely
countryside
till
i
saw
before
me
the
houses
of
a
town
i
thought
that
i
had
better
skirt
the
town
lest
i
should
tumble
on
the
coastguards
and
rouse
their
suspicions
it
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
a
boy
to
be
abroad
and
i
had
no
very
satisfactory
account
to
give
of
myself
in
case
anybody
questioned
me
i
knew
that
if
i
said
that
i
had
been
among
the
smugglers
i
should
be
sent
to
prison
i
felt
that
the
magistrate
would
be
too
angry
to
listen
to
my
story
and
that
they
would
perhaps
send
to
me
prison
at
once
if
they
ever
got
hold
of
me
magistrates
in
those
days
had
a
great
deal
of
power
they
were
often
illiterate
and
they
bullied
and
hectored
the
people
whom
they
tried
i
had
seen
one
or
two
bad
magistrates
at
home
and
i
knew
how
little
chance
i
should
stand
if
i
told
my
unlikely
story
to
a
bench
in
a
before
such
men
as
they
were
so
i
turned
up
a
small
road
to
the
right
avoiding
the
town
where
as
i
could
see
a
good
deal
of
bustle
was
stirring
indeed
the
streets
were
full
of
people
as
the
sun
rose
higher
i
began
to
meet
people
a
few
labouring
men
came
past
me
one
of
them
carrying
a
pitchfork
i
noticed
that
they
looked
at
me
curiously
one
of
them
spoke
and
said
you
have
been
in
the
wars
master
so
i
said
yes
and
passed
on
wondering
what
he
meant
after
i
had
passed
the
man
stopped
to
look
back
at
me
i
even
heard
him
take
a
few
steps
towards
me
before
he
thought
better
of
it
and
went
on
upon
his
way
this
set
me
wondering
if
there
were
anything
strange
about
my
appearance
so
when
i
came
to
the
little
brook
or
river
which
crossed
the
road
a
little
further
on
i
went
down
to
a
pool
where
the
water
was
still
and
looked
at
my
image
in
the
water
sure
enough
i
had
an
odd
appearance
the
blow
which
the
soldier
gave
me
had
broken
the
skin
of
my
scalp
not
badly
but
enough
to
make
an
ugly
scar
you
may
be
sure
that
i
lost
no
time
in
washing
my
face
and
head
till
no
stains
showed
i
rebuked
myself
for
not
having
done
this
while
aboard
the
lugger
when
i
had
splashed
my
head
at
the
i
felt
all
the
better
for
the
wash
in
the
brook
but
when
i
took
to
the
road
again
i
had
a
great
fear
lest
the
labourers
should
hear
of
the
battle
and
give
out
that
they
had
seen
a
wounded
boy
going
along
the
road
away
from
the
beach
after
a
mile
of
lane
i
came
to
a
highroad
past
a
church
and
houses
all
very
peaceful
and
still
i
passed
these
and
wandered
on
along
the
highroad
thinking
that
i
had
gone
many
miles
from
the
sea
though
of
course
i
had
only
gone
a
little
distance
when
one
walks
a
new
road
one
finds
it
much
longer
than
it
really
is
i
sat
down
by
the
roadside
now
and
then
to
think
of
plans
i
felt
that
my
best
plan
would
be
to
go
to
london
and
see
the
lord
mayor
who
i
felt
sure
would
help
me
to
get
home
but
i
had
not
much
notion
of
where
london
was
and
i
knew
that
if
i
went
into
a
house
to
ask
the
road
to
london
people
would
suspect
that
i
was
running
away
and
so
perhaps
find
out
that
i
had
been
with
the
smugglers
i
knew
that
many
people
there
must
be
smugglers
themselves
but
then
suppose
that
i
asked
at
a
house
where
they
were
friends
of
the
preventives
the
smugglers
had
signs
among
themselves
by
which
they
recognised
each
other
they
used
to
scratch
the
left
ear
with
the
left
little
finger
and
then
bite
the
lower
lip
before
shaking
hands
with
anybody
i
thought
that
i
would
go
into
an
inn
and
try
these
signs
on
somebody
on
the
landlord
if
possible
and
then
ask
his
advice
an
inn
would
be
a
good
place
i
thought
because
the
landlord
would
be
sure
to
buy
from
the
smugglers
besides
in
inns
there
are
generally
maps
of
the
country
showing
the
coaching
houses
and
the
days
of
the
fairs
a
map
of
the
kind
would
show
me
my
road
and
be
a
help
to
me
in
that
way
even
if
the
landlord
did
not
recognise
my
signs
and
yet
i
was
half
afraid
of
trying
these
signs
i
did
not
want
to
get
back
among
the
smugglers
i
only
wanted
to
get
to
london
i
had
that
foolish
belief
that
the
lord
mayor
would
help
me
i
was
too
young
to
know
better
and
besides
i
was
afraid
that
my
being
with
the
smugglers
would
perhaps
get
me
hanged
if
i
were
caught
by
one
of
those
magistrates
whom
i
so
much
feared
presently
i
came
to
another
little
village
rather
larger
than
the
last
there
was
an
inn
in
the
main
street
the
blue
boar
so
i
went
into
the
and
looked
about
me
one
or
two
men
were
talking
earnestly
in
low
voices
to
a
woman
behind
the
bar
she
looked
up
at
me
rather
sharply
as
i
entered
and
the
men
turned
round
and
stared
at
me
made
a
few
more
remarks
to
the
woman
and
went
quickly
out
i
looked
at
the
woman
scratched
my
left
ear
with
my
left
little
finger
and
bit
my
lower
lip
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
and
turned
quite
white
evidently
she
knew
that
sign
extremely
well
what
is
it
she
said
what
the
news
there
been
fighting
where
dick
i
said
i
did
know
where
dick
was
but
that
there
had
been
fighting
sure
enough
and
the
preventives
had
been
beaten
off
ah
she
said
and
the
stuff
did
they
get
the
stuff
off
i
said
i
believed
that
it
had
got
off
safely
i
believe
everybody
bewitched
she
said
bursting
into
tears
oh
dick
come
back
to
me
come
back
to
me
oh
why
did
i
ever
marry
a
man
like
you
she
cried
bitterly
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
fight
one
question
she
repeated
many
times
was
there
a
grey
horse
in
the
second
string
but
this
i
could
not
answer
certainly
all
the
time
that
we
were
talking
she
was
crying
and
laughing
by
turns
whenever
a
person
entered
even
if
it
were
only
the
milkman
she
turned
white
and
shook
as
though
expecting
the
police
it
the
palpitation
she
would
explain
that
and
the
sizzums
then
she
would
go
on
laughing
and
crying
by
turns
until
some
one
else
came
in
presently
the
landlady
looked
at
me
rather
hard
here
she
said
you
are
not
one
of
them
you
run
away
from
home
you
have
what
are
you
doing
here
i
said
that
i
was
on
my
way
to
london
to
london
she
said
what
a
boy
like
you
going
to
london
for
how
are
you
going
i
said
that
i
was
going
to
walk
there
to
see
the
lord
mayor
to
see
the
lord
mayor
she
repeated
is
the
boy
daft
or
what
i
blushed
and
hung
my
head
for
i
did
not
like
to
be
laughed
at
what
are
you
going
to
see
the
lord
mayor
for
she
asked
with
a
smile
i
answered
that
he
would
send
me
home
to
my
friends
as
he
was
always
generous
to
people
in
distress
she
laughed
very
heartily
when
i
had
said
this
but
still
not
unkindly
then
she
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
my
joining
the
smugglers
about
my
friends
at
home
particularly
if
they
were
well
off
and
about
the
money
i
had
to
carry
me
to
london
when
i
had
told
her
everything
she
said
well
why
do
you
write
to
your
friends
from
here
surely
that
a
more
sensible
plan
than
going
to
london
why
london
seventy
miles
write
to
your
friends
from
here
they
will
get
the
letter
in
three
or
four
days
they
will
be
here
within
a
week
from
now
that
a
wiser
thing
to
do
than
going
to
london
why
you
die
in
a
ditch
before
you
got
i
should
i
answered
hotly
well
if
you
did
you
get
taken
up
it
all
the
same
she
answered
you
stop
here
and
write
to
your
friends
i
will
see
that
the
letter
goes
all
right
i
suppose
she
continued
i
suppose
your
friends
would
let
me
be
a
loser
by
you
they
pay
for
what
you
ate
and
that
yes
i
said
of
course
they
will
what
your
name
she
said
sharply
i
told
her
oh
she
said
jim
jim
davis
let
see
that
shirt
of
yours
to
see
if
it
got
your
name
on
i
been
taken
in
once
or
twice
before
one
has
to
look
alive
keeping
an
inn
luckily
my
name
was
upon
my
shirt
and
stockings
so
that
she
accepted
my
story
without
further
talk
especially
as
the
contents
of
my
package
showed
her
that
i
told
her
the
truth
about
the
lugger
i
do
know
what
dick
will
say
she
said
but
now
you
come
up
and
i
dress
your
head
you
have
to
lie
low
remember
it
wo
do
for
a
smuggler
like
you
to
be
seen
about
here
so
till
your
friends
come
you
keep
pretty
dark
remember
she
led
me
upstairs
to
plaster
my
wound
then
she
put
me
into
a
little
bedroom
on
one
of
the
upper
floors
and
told
me
to
stay
there
till
she
called
me
there
were
one
or
two
books
upon
the
shelf
including
a
funny
one
with
woodcuts
a
collection
of
tales
and
ballads
such
as
the
pedlers
used
to
sell
in
those
days
with
this
book
and
with
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
i
passed
the
morning
more
happily
than
i
can
say
my
head
felt
quite
easy
after
it
had
been
dressed
and
bandaged
my
troubles
were
nearly
over
i
thought
in
a
week
my
friends
would
be
there
to
fetch
me
away
in
three
days
they
would
get
my
letter
and
hear
all
about
my
adventures
so
as
i
wrote
i
almost
sang
aloud
i
was
so
happy
at
the
thought
of
my
sorrows
being
ended
mrs
dick
i
never
learned
her
real
name
till
some
years
afterwards
brought
me
some
bread
and
cheese
at
midday
as
i
ate
she
sealed
and
addressed
my
letter
for
me
and
took
it
over
to
the
so
that
the
postman
could
carry
it
to
meet
the
mail
as
it
drove
past
from
rye
towards
london
after
my
midday
meal
i
felt
strangely
weary
perhaps
all
my
excitements
had
been
too
much
for
me
when
mrs
dick
came
back
to
say
that
she
had
posted
my
letter
i
was
almost
asleep
but
her
manner
was
so
strange
that
it
roused
me
she
could
hardly
speak
from
anxiety
and
terror
oh
she
cried
they
have
raised
the
whole
country
my
dick
be
taken
he
will
he
will
they
riding
all
through
the
land
arresting
everybody
and
they
going
to
hang
them
all
they
say
as
soon
as
they
can
give
them
their
trials
she
cried
and
cried
as
though
her
heart
would
break
i
did
what
i
could
to
comfort
her
but
still
she
cried
hysterically
and
for
all
that
afternoon
she
sobbed
and
laughed
in
the
little
upper
bedroom
only
going
out
at
rare
intervals
to
peep
into
the
bar
where
her
servant
served
the
guests
towards
five
the
servant
came
running
upstairs
to
say
that
a
lot
of
the
smugglers
had
been
taken
a
whole
boatload
the
girl
said
so
that
now
it
would
all
come
out
and
master
would
be
hanged
mrs
dick
told
her
not
to
talk
in
that
way
of
her
master
but
to
find
out
if
any
of
the
men
had
peached
when
the
girl
had
gone
she
seemed
to
collect
herself
she
became
a
different
woman
in
a
minute
well
if
he
taken
she
said
they
be
here
that
very
sure
they
search
the
premises
they
must
find
you
here
mr
jim
if
they
find
you
they
question
you
and
you
know
too
much
by
a
long
way
shall
i
go
i
asked
i
willing
to
clear
out
if
you
wish
go
she
said
go
i
will
turn
no
poor
boy
out
into
the
road
i
have
a
boy
of
my
own
somewhere
walking
the
world
no
i
put
you
in
the
come
with
me
and
do
make
a
noise
she
led
me
downstairs
to
the
foot
of
the
lowest
staircase
which
was
rather
broad
with
high
steps
of
stout
old
oak
look
she
said
as
she
stepped
away
from
me
i
suppose
to
touch
some
secret
spring
this
is
the
as
she
spoke
the
two
lowest
stairs
suddenly
rolled
back
upon
a
sort
of
hinge
showing
a
little
room
not
much
bigger
than
a
couple
of
barrels
arranged
underneath
them
there
were
blankets
and
a
mattress
upon
the
floor
of
this
little
room
besides
several
packages
like
those
which
i
had
seen
in
the
lugger
you
have
to
stay
here
jim
she
said
kindly
but
first
of
all
i
must
get
together
dick
papers
and
that
come
on
and
help
me
very
soon
she
had
gathered
together
a
few
papers
and
packets
of
tobacco
and
lace
which
might
have
brought
dick
into
trouble
she
laid
these
away
in
the
recesses
of
the
secret
room
and
told
me
to
get
inside
and
go
to
sleep
and
above
all
things
to
keep
very
still
if
people
came
along
upon
the
stairs
i
crept
inside
rather
frightened
and
lay
down
among
the
blankets
to
get
some
rest
then
mrs
dick
swung
the
two
stairs
back
in
to
their
place
a
spring
clicked
and
i
was
a
prisoner
in
the
dark
shut
up
in
the
chapter
xviii
tracked
it
was
very
dark
in
the
under
the
stairs
and
rather
stuffy
for
the
only
light
and
air
admitted
came
through
a
little
narrow
crack
about
six
inches
long
and
half
an
inch
across
at
its
broadest
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
mice
among
other
smells
and
the
mice
came
scampering
all
over
me
before
i
had
lain
there
long
i
lay
as
still
as
i
could
because
of
what
mrs
dick
had
said
and
i
fell
asleep
in
spite
of
the
mice
and
slept
until
it
was
dark
i
was
awakened
by
the
rolling
back
of
the
stairs
as
i
started
up
thinking
that
i
was
captured
i
saw
mrs
dick
standing
over
me
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
hush
jim
she
said
get
out
quickly
do
ask
any
questions
get
out
at
once
you
ca
stay
here
any
longer
what
has
happened
i
asked
where
is
your
husband
has
your
husband
come
home
yes
she
said
and
you
must
go
they
coming
after
you
you
were
seen
in
the
lugger
with
an
axe
in
your
hands
a
man
who
passed
you
on
the
road
after
saw
you
in
the
lugger
he
was
with
the
soldiers
and
now
he
given
an
information
mary
the
girl
heard
it
down
at
the
magistrate
where
the
inquest
is
and
so
you
must
go
besides
i
want
the
for
my
dick
he
has
come
back
and
they
be
after
him
quite
likely
he
was
seen
they
say
so
he
must
lie
low
till
we
arranged
the
alibi
as
they
call
it
everybody
has
to
have
an
alibi
and
so
my
dick
have
one
just
to
make
sure
mind
your
head
against
the
stair
i
crawled
out
rubbing
my
eyes
where
shall
i
go
to
i
asked
oh
she
said
until
we
find
out
you
had
better
go
in
the
stable
in
among
the
feed
in
the
box
or
covered
up
in
the
hay
when
she
had
settled
her
husband
safely
into
the
she
bustled
me
out
of
doors
into
the
stable
which
stood
in
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
inn
she
put
me
into
a
mass
of
loose
hay
in
one
of
the
unused
stalls
there
she
said
they
never
look
for
you
there
do
get
and
begin
to
sneeze
though
here
your
parcel
for
you
it
would
do
to
leave
that
about
in
the
house
would
it
she
wished
me
good
night
and
bustled
back
to
the
inn
to
laugh
and
jest
as
though
nothing
was
happening
and
as
though
she
had
no
trouble
in
the
world
i
lay
very
quietly
in
my
warm
nest
in
the
hay
feeling
lonely
in
that
still
stable
after
my
nights
in
the
lugger
among
the
men
the
old
horse
stamped
once
or
twice
and
the
stable
cat
came
purring
to
me
seeking
to
be
petted
the
church
clock
struck
nine
and
rang
out
a
chime
shortly
after
nine
i
heard
the
clatter
of
many
horses
hoofs
coming
along
the
road
and
then
the
noise
of
cavalry
jingling
and
clattering
into
the
inn
yard
a
horse
whinnied
the
old
horse
in
the
stable
whinnied
in
answer
a
curt
voice
called
to
the
men
to
dismount
and
for
some
one
to
hold
the
horses
i
strained
my
ears
to
hear
any
further
words
but
some
one
banging
on
a
door
i
guessed
it
to
be
the
inn
door
drowned
the
orders
then
some
one
cried
out
well
break
it
in
then
do
come
asking
me
after
that
there
was
more
banging
an
excited
cry
from
a
woman
and
a
few
minutes
of
quiet
i
crept
from
my
to
the
window
so
that
i
might
see
what
was
happening
the
whole
yard
was
full
of
cavalry
a
couple
of
troopers
were
holding
horses
quite
close
to
the
door
by
listening
carefully
i
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
yes
said
one
of
them
i
got
a
proper
lick
myself
i
sha
mind
if
they
do
get
caught
they
say
there
some
of
them
caught
in
a
boat
yes
said
his
mate
three
and
they
do
say
we
shall
find
a
boy
here
as
well
as
the
other
fellow
there
was
a
boy
aboard
all
night
and
he
been
tracked
here
he
as
good
as
caught
i
reckon
i
suppose
they
all
be
hanged
said
the
first
yes
said
the
other
wo
be
no
defence
for
them
neck
or
nothing
hey
then
they
passed
out
of
earshot
leading
their
horses
i
was
so
horribly
scared
that
i
was
almost
beside
myself
what
could
i
do
where
could
i
go
where
could
i
hide
the
only
door
and
window
opened
on
to
the
courtyard
the
loft
was
my
only
chance
i
snatched
up
my
parcel
and
ran
to
the
little
ladder
nailed
to
the
wall
which
led
to
the
loft
and
climbed
up
as
though
the
hounds
were
after
me
even
in
the
loft
i
was
not
much
better
off
there
was
a
heap
of
hay
and
a
few
bundles
of
straw
lying
at
one
end
and
two
great
opening
on
to
the
courtyard
through
which
the
hay
and
straw
had
been
passed
to
shelter
it
was
plainly
useless
to
lie
down
in
the
straw
that
would
be
the
first
place
searched
i
should
be
caught
at
once
if
i
hid
among
the
straw
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
loft
must
lead
to
a
i
had
seen
a
above
and
at
one
end
of
the
stable
and
i
judged
that
the
loft
would
communicate
with
it
it
was
not
very
light
but
by
groping
along
the
end
wall
i
came
to
a
little
latched
door
leading
to
another
little
room
this
was
the
and
as
i
burst
into
it
closing
the
door
behind
me
the
many
pigeons
rustled
and
stirred
upon
their
nests
and
perches
it
was
darker
in
the
than
in
the
loft
but
i
could
see
that
the
place
was
bigger
than
the
loft
itself
and
this
gave
me
hope
that
there
would
be
an
opening
at
the
back
of
it
away
from
the
yard
i
had
not
much
time
i
knew
because
the
troopers
were
already
trying
to
open
the
below
me
i
could
hear
them
pounding
and
grumbling
just
as
i
heard
them
say
that
it
the
bar
lifts
up
there
you
are
showing
that
they
had
found
how
to
open
the
door
i
came
to
a
little
door
at
the
back
a
little
rotten
door
locked
and
bolted
with
rusty
cobwebbed
iron
very
cautiously
i
turned
the
lock
and
drew
the
bolts
back
the
latch
creaked
under
my
thumb
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
i
was
outside
the
door
on
a
little
rotten
wooden
landing
from
which
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
led
downward
i
saw
beyond
me
a
few
a
byre
several
pigsties
and
three
disused
waggons
voices
sounded
in
the
stable
as
i
climbed
down
the
steps
i
heard
a
man
say
he
might
be
in
the
loft
we
might
look
there
and
then
i
touched
the
ground
and
scurried
quickly
past
the
shelters
to
the
outer
wall
happily
for
me
the
wall
was
with
ivy
so
that
i
could
climb
to
the
top
there
was
a
drop
on
the
far
side
into
a
lane
but
it
was
now
neck
or
nothing
so
i
let
myself
go
i
came
down
with
a
crack
which
made
my
teeth
rattle
my
parcel
spun
away
into
a
bed
of
nettles
and
i
got
well
stung
in
fishing
it
out
then
i
strapped
it
on
my
back
and
turned
along
the
lane
in
the
direction
which
as
i
judged
led
me
away
from
the
sea
as
i
stepped
out
on
my
adventures
i
heard
the
ordered
trample
of
horses
leaving
the
together
to
seek
elsewhere
the
lane
soon
ended
at
a
stile
which
led
into
a
field
i
saw
a
barn
or
shed
just
beyond
the
stile
and
in
the
shed
there
was
a
heap
of
hay
which
smelt
a
little
mouldy
i
lay
down
upon
it
determined
to
wake
early
and
creep
back
to
the
inn
before
anybody
stirred
in
the
village
ah
well
i
said
to
myself
before
i
fell
asleep
in
a
week
time
they
will
be
here
to
take
me
home
then
my
troubles
will
be
over
i
remember
that
all
my
fear
of
the
troops
was
gone
i
felt
so
sure
that
all
would
be
well
in
the
morning
so
putting
my
parcel
under
my
head
as
a
pillow
i
snuggled
down
into
the
hay
and
very
soon
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
entrance
of
an
old
who
came
to
smell
at
the
hay
it
was
light
enough
to
see
where
i
was
going
so
i
opened
my
knapsack
and
made
a
rough
breakfast
before
setting
out
overnight
i
had
planned
to
go
back
to
the
inn
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
that
plan
did
not
seem
so
very
wise
as
i
had
thought
it
i
was
almost
afraid
to
put
it
into
practice
however
i
went
back
along
the
lane
with
some
trouble
i
got
over
the
tall
brick
wall
down
which
i
had
dropped
the
night
before
then
i
climbed
up
to
the
down
the
into
the
to
the
broken
back
door
of
the
tavern
the
door
hung
from
one
hinge
with
its
lower
panels
kicked
in
just
as
the
soldiers
had
left
it
the
inn
was
open
to
anybody
who
cared
to
enter
i
entered
cautiously
half
expecting
to
find
a
few
soldiers
billeted
there
but
the
place
was
empty
i
went
from
room
to
room
finding
no
one
dick
seemed
to
have
disappeared
one
of
the
rooms
was
in
disorder
a
few
broken
glasses
were
on
the
floor
a
chair
lay
on
its
side
under
the
table
i
went
upstairs
i
tapped
at
the
outside
of
the
no
answer
there
all
was
still
there
i
listened
attentively
for
some
sound
of
breathing
none
came
no
one
was
inside
i
went
all
over
the
house
no
one
was
there
i
was
alone
in
the
blue
boar
the
only
person
in
the
house
i
could
only
guess
that
mr
and
mrs
dick
had
been
arrested
to
be
sure
they
might
have
run
away
together
during
the
night
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
think
in
my
wanderings
i
came
to
the
bar
which
i
found
in
great
disorder
the
bench
was
upset
jugs
and
glasses
were
scattered
on
the
floor
and
the
blinds
had
not
been
pulled
up
although
i
had
some
fear
of
being
seen
from
outside
i
pulled
up
the
blinds
to
let
in
a
little
light
so
that
i
might
look
at
the
which
hung
at
one
end
of
the
bar
when
i
passed
behind
the
bar
to
trace
out
for
myself
the
road
to
london
i
saw
an
open
book
lying
on
a
shelf
among
the
bottles
it
was
a
copy
of
captain
johnson
of
the
highwaymen
and
lying
open
at
the
life
of
captain
roberts
the
famous
pirate
whydah
some
one
must
have
been
reading
it
when
the
soldiers
entered
i
looked
at
it
curiously
for
it
was
open
at
the
portrait
of
roberts
underneath
the
portrait
were
a
few
words
written
in
pencil
in
a
clumsy
scrawl
i
read
them
over
expecting
some
of
the
ordinary
schoolboy
nonsense
captain
roberts
was
a
bad
one
do
come
back
here
the
lobsters
is
around
that
was
all
the
message
but
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
meant
for
me
that
mrs
dick
knowing
that
i
should
come
back
had
done
her
best
to
leave
a
warning
for
me
lobsters
i
knew
was
the
smugglers
slang
for
soldiers
and
if
the
lobsters
were
dangerous
to
me
it
was
plain
that
i
was
wanted
for
my
innocent
share
in
the
fight
i
looked
through
the
book
for
any
further
message
but
there
was
no
other
entry
except
a
brief
pencilled
memorandum
of
what
some
one
had
paid
for
groceries
many
years
before
at
some
market
town
not
named
chapter
xix
the
road
to
london
you
may
be
sure
that
i
lost
no
time
in
leaving
the
inn
i
merely
noted
the
way
to
london
from
the
and
hurried
out
repeating
the
direction
so
that
i
should
not
forget
it
was
a
bright
cool
morning
and
i
walked
very
briskly
for
a
couple
of
hours
when
i
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
roadside
under
a
patch
of
willows
which
grew
about
a
little
bubbling
brook
presently
i
saw
that
a
little
way
ahead
of
me
were
three
people
a
boy
with
his
father
and
mother
sitting
by
the
road
resting
they
got
up
after
i
had
been
there
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
and
came
along
the
road
towards
me
bowed
under
their
bundles
i
got
up
too
intending
to
continue
my
journey
but
when
i
was
about
to
pass
them
the
man
drew
up
in
front
of
me
beg
your
pardon
young
master
he
said
but
could
you
tell
me
the
way
to
big
ben
but
that
in
london
i
said
that
in
london
at
the
house
of
parliament
what
he
cried
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
us
have
come
the
wrong
road
yes
i
said
you
going
the
wrong
way
for
london
then
take
that
cried
the
man
giving
me
a
shove
just
as
the
woman
flung
her
shawl
over
my
head
i
stepped
back
for
the
shove
was
no
light
one
but
just
behind
me
the
boy
had
crouched
on
all
fours
he
had
evidently
practised
the
trick
so
that
i
went
headlong
over
him
and
had
a
nasty
fall
into
the
road
stop
his
mouth
martha
said
the
man
and
stop
it
she
did
with
her
ragged
old
shawl
in
which
she
had
evidently
carried
the
provisions
of
the
gang
what
he
got
on
him
said
the
woman
as
the
man
rummaged
through
my
pockets
only
a
prince
and
a
chive
said
the
man
disgustedly
meaning
my
and
a
well
said
the
woman
his
jacket
better
than
bill
and
have
his
little
portmanteau
what
more
in
another
minute
they
had
my
suit
stripped
from
me
and
i
had
the
sight
of
dirty
little
bill
the
tramper
boy
putting
on
my
things
here
said
the
woman
you
put
on
bill
things
they
good
enough
for
you
and
do
you
dare
breathe
a
word
of
what
we
done
yes
said
the
man
as
bill
buttoned
up
his
jacket
and
took
my
little
bundle
in
his
hand
you
keep
your
little
jaw
shut
or
come
after
you
oh
mother
said
bill
do
i
look
a
young
swell
neither
for
answer
his
mother
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
and
the
three
hurried
away
from
me
in
the
direction
from
which
i
had
come
the
man
looked
back
and
made
a
face
at
me
shaking
his
fist
i
was
left
penniless
in
the
road
a
milestone
told
me
that
i
was
seventy
miles
from
london
i
was
now
at
the
end
of
my
resources
almost
too
miserable
to
cry
i
did
not
know
what
was
to
become
of
me
i
could
only
wander
along
the
road
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
wishing
for
marah
i
was
wretched
and
faint
and
marah
was
so
strong
and
careless
then
i
said
to
myself
that
marah
was
dead
and
that
i
should
soon
be
dead
for
i
had
neither
food
nor
money
the
smugglers
had
talked
of
shipwrecks
once
or
twice
i
had
heard
them
say
that
a
man
could
live
for
three
days
without
food
or
drink
in
fair
weather
and
that
without
food
drinking
plenty
of
water
he
could
live
for
three
weeks
they
were
very
wild
talkers
to
be
sure
but
i
remembered
this
now
and
got
comfort
from
it
surely
i
thought
i
shall
be
able
to
last
for
a
week
and
in
a
week
i
ought
to
be
near
london
besides
i
can
eat
grass
and
perhaps
i
shall
find
a
turnip
or
a
potato
or
a
partridge
nest
with
young
ones
still
in
it
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
earn
a
few
coppers
by
opening
gates
or
holding
horses
i
plucked
up
wonderfully
when
i
thought
of
all
these
things
though
i
did
not
at
all
like
wearing
bill
clothes
i
felt
that
i
looked
like
a
dirty
young
tramp
and
that
anybody
who
saw
me
would
think
that
i
was
one
besides
i
had
always
hated
dirt
and
untidiness
and
the
feeling
that
i
carried
both
about
me
was
hateful
but
bill
clothes
were
to
be
a
great
help
to
me
before
noon
that
day
as
i
wandered
along
the
road
wondering
where
i
could
get
something
to
eat
for
i
was
now
very
hungry
i
came
to
a
turnpike
the
was
cleaning
his
windows
outside
his
little
house
when
he
saw
me
he
just
popped
his
head
inside
the
door
and
said
something
to
some
people
inside
his
manner
frightened
me
but
i
was
still
more
frightened
when
two
bow
street
runners
as
we
called
detectives
then
and
a
yeomanry
officer
came
out
of
the
house
and
laid
hold
of
me
that
your
boy
sir
said
the
come
on
in
here
said
the
officer
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
they
led
me
into
the
room
where
they
were
eating
some
bread
and
cheese
he
does
answer
the
description
said
one
of
the
men
glancing
at
a
paper
i
not
so
sure
about
that
said
the
officer
he
the
exact
height
and
that
the
same
coloured
hair
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
said
the
keeper
i
believe
i
saw
that
boy
pass
along
here
this
morning
along
with
two
trampers
that
coat
with
the
pocket
torn
yes
and
red
lining
showing
i
thought
i
seen
them
well
boy
said
the
officer
what
your
name
jim
davis
i
answered
what
were
you
doing
with
the
two
trampers
jim
he
asked
please
sir
i
said
i
was
doing
anything
with
them
ah
said
one
of
the
runners
these
young
rogues
is
that
artful
they
never
do
nothing
anywhere
you
live
to
be
hanged
i
know
said
the
other
runner
what
were
you
doing
with
the
smugglers
asked
the
officer
suddenly
staring
hard
at
my
face
to
watch
for
any
change
of
expression
but
i
was
ready
for
him
a
boy
is
often
better
able
to
keep
his
countenance
than
a
grown
man
with
masters
and
aunts
and
all
down
upon
him
he
lives
a
hunted
life
he
gets
lots
of
practice
in
keeping
his
countenance
a
grown
man
often
gets
very
little
what
smugglers
sir
i
asked
as
boldly
as
i
could
the
men
you
sailed
with
from
etaples
said
the
officer
sailed
with
i
asked
feeling
that
i
was
done
for
did
the
horses
splash
about
when
you
cut
the
cable
said
the
officer
with
a
smile
this
time
i
thought
i
had
better
not
answer
i
looked
as
puzzled
as
i
could
and
looked
from
one
face
to
the
other
as
though
for
enlightenment
now
jim
said
one
of
the
runners
it
no
good
tell
us
all
about
the
smugglers
and
we
let
you
go
we
know
you
the
boy
we
want
said
the
captain
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
perhaps
you
will
get
off
with
transportation
now
do
look
so
innocent
said
the
other
runner
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
or
we
make
you
now
somewhere
i
had
read
that
the
police
bullied
suspected
persons
in
this
way
if
you
make
a
guilty
person
believe
that
you
know
him
to
be
guilty
you
can
also
get
him
to
confess
if
you
startle
him
sufficiently
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
was
what
these
men
were
doing
especially
as
they
had
not
been
sure
of
me
when
i
came
into
the
room
i
had
some
twenty
or
thirty
seconds
in
which
to
think
of
an
answer
for
the
three
men
spoke
one
after
the
other
without
giving
me
a
chance
to
speak
i
shook
my
head
putting
on
a
puzzled
look
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
said
speaking
rather
roughly
in
the
accent
which
bill
had
used
i
think
there
some
mistake
oh
i
think
not
said
the
officer
suppose
i
tell
you
how
many
men
were
in
the
lugger
but
here
we
were
stopped
by
the
arrival
of
a
chaise
outside
a
man
entered
hurriedly
it
all
right
gray
the
newcomer
called
to
the
officer
we
have
the
boy
we
caught
him
back
there
along
the
road
with
a
couple
of
gipsies
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
clothes
and
bundle
are
just
as
they
described
in
the
advertisement
who
have
you
here
oh
a
boy
we
brought
in
on
suspicion
said
the
officer
shall
we
let
him
go
well
who
is
he
asked
the
new
arrival
eh
boy
who
are
you
a
poor
boy
i
answered
how
do
you
make
a
living
he
asked
little
boys
like
you
to
be
about
on
the
roads
you
know
what
d
do
for
a
living
i
am
afraid
it
was
rather
a
bold
statement
but
i
cried
out
that
i
could
sing
ballads
oh
jim
so
you
sing
ballads
do
you
said
the
officer
get
on
to
that
chair
and
sing
us
a
ballad
but
i
was
cunning
and
wary
please
sir
i
said
i
very
hungry
i
do
sing
except
for
my
dinner
and
a
sixpence
so
you
defy
the
law
already
do
you
said
the
newcomer
well
eat
some
bread
and
cheese
and
i
will
give
you
sixpence
for
a
song
so
i
sat
down
very
thankfully
and
made
a
good
dinner
at
the
table
i
pretended
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
officers
but
really
i
listened
very
eagerly
to
all
that
they
said
i
gathered
that
the
newcomer
was
a
coastguard
naval
captain
of
the
name
of
byrne
and
i
felt
that
he
and
me
without
thinking
very
much
about
me
one
way
or
the
other
when
i
had
finished
my
dinner
and
i
ate
enough
to
last
me
till
the
night
i
got
upon
my
chair
without
being
pressed
and
sang
the
ballad
of
the
white
cockade
then
very
popular
all
over
the
west
country
my
voice
was
not
bad
in
those
days
and
i
was
used
to
singing
indeed
people
sang
more
then
than
they
do
now
everybody
sang
captain
byrne
seemed
puzzled
by
my
voice
and
by
my
cultivated
accent
who
taught
you
to
sing
he
asked
so
i
answered
that
i
had
been
in
the
village
choir
at
home
which
was
true
enough
and
where
was
that
he
asked
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
i
would
trust
him
and
tell
him
everything
then
very
foolishly
i
determined
to
say
nothing
so
i
said
that
it
was
a
long
way
away
and
that
i
had
come
from
thence
after
my
father
had
died
he
whispered
something
to
gray
the
other
officer
and
they
looked
at
me
curiously
they
both
gave
me
a
sixpenny
piece
for
my
ballad
and
then
they
went
out
captain
byrne
stopped
at
the
door
look
here
he
said
you
take
my
advice
and
go
home
you
will
come
to
no
good
leading
this
wandering
life
when
they
had
gone
i
went
out
also
and
watched
their
chaise
disappear
the
last
that
i
saw
of
them
was
the
two
of
the
runners
sticking
up
at
the
back
of
the
conveyance
like
little
black
chimneys
i
felt
very
glad
that
bill
was
taken
up
evidently
in
mistake
for
me
it
seemed
a
fitting
reward
but
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
the
mistake
might
be
found
out
at
any
moment
and
that
i
should
be
searched
for
as
soon
as
bill
had
cleared
himself
i
walked
slowly
away
from
the
turnpike
so
that
the
keeper
might
not
suspect
me
and
then
i
nipped
over
a
stile
and
ran
away
across
country
going
inland
away
from
the
sea
as
fast
as
i
could
travel
i
could
tell
my
direction
by
the
sun
and
i
kept
a
westerly
course
almost
due
west
for
three
or
four
hours
till
i
was
tired
out
it
was
a
lonely
walk
too
hardly
anything
but
wild
rather
marshy
country
with
few
houses
few
churches
and
no
bigger
town
than
the
tiniest
of
villages
at
about
six
that
afternoon
when
i
had
gone
some
sixteen
miles
since
daybreak
i
felt
that
i
could
go
no
further
and
began
to
cast
about
for
a
chapter
xx
the
gipsy
camp
i
plodded
on
till
i
came
to
a
sort
of
copse
or
little
wood
where
i
expected
to
find
shelter
supper
i
had
resolved
to
do
without
i
wished
to
keep
my
shilling
for
dinner
and
breakfast
the
next
day
as
i
came
up
to
the
copse
hedge
i
saw
that
some
gipsies
were
camped
there
they
had
a
fine
travelling
waggon
drawn
up
on
some
waste
ground
near
at
hand
they
had
also
pitched
three
or
four
beehive
huts
made
of
bent
poles
covered
with
sacks
they
were
and
as
one
could
see
from
the
drove
of
lean
horses
and
heap
of
near
the
waggon
several
children
were
playing
about
among
the
huts
some
women
were
at
their
by
the
waggon
a
man
smoking
a
pipe
stood
by
the
hedge
mending
what
looked
like
an
enormous
butterfly
net
in
spite
of
my
adventure
on
the
road
i
was
not
at
all
frightened
by
these
gipsies
because
i
liked
their
looks
and
i
knew
now
that
i
had
only
my
shilling
to
lose
and
that
i
could
earn
a
dinner
at
any
time
by
singing
a
ballad
the
man
looked
rather
hard
at
me
as
i
came
near
and
called
out
in
a
strange
language
to
his
people
in
the
tents
they
came
about
me
at
the
call
and
stared
at
me
very
strangely
as
though
i
was
a
queer
beast
escaped
from
a
menagerie
then
to
my
great
surprise
the
man
pointed
to
my
forehead
and
all
the
gipsies
stared
at
my
forehead
repeating
those
queer
words
which
marah
had
used
so
long
before
in
the
orel
orel
adartha
cay
they
seemed
very
pleased
and
proud
they
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
as
though
i
was
a
little
prince
all
the
time
they
kept
singing
and
talking
in
their
curious
language
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
come
up
to
me
and
push
back
my
cap
to
look
at
my
hair
which
was
of
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
dash
of
reddy
gold
above
my
forehead
i
learned
afterwards
that
gipsies
held
sacred
all
boys
with
hair
like
mine
they
call
the
ruddy
tinge
over
the
forehead
the
cross
upon
crutches
for
long
ago
they
say
a
great
gipsy
hero
had
that
mark
upon
his
brow
in
lines
of
fire
and
to
this
day
all
people
with
a
fiery
lock
of
hair
they
believe
bring
luck
to
them
when
the
gipsies
had
danced
for
some
twenty
minutes
the
elderly
man
who
seemed
to
be
a
chief
among
them
begged
me
in
english
with
many
profound
bows
and
smiles
to
enter
their
waggon
i
had
heard
that
the
gipsies
stole
little
children
but
as
i
had
never
heard
of
them
stealing
a
boy
of
my
age
i
did
not
fear
them
so
i
entered
the
waggon
as
he
bade
me
and
very
neat
and
trim
it
was
here
a
man
produced
a
curious
red
suit
of
clothes
rather
too
small
for
me
but
still
a
lot
better
than
bill
rags
he
begged
me
to
put
it
on
which
i
did
i
know
now
that
it
was
the
red
magical
suit
in
which
the
gipsies
dress
their
magical
puppets
on
john
eve
but
as
i
did
not
then
know
this
i
put
it
on
quite
willingly
wishing
that
it
fitted
better
then
we
came
out
again
among
the
huts
and
all
the
other
gipsies
crowded
round
me
laughing
and
clapping
their
hands
for
now
they
thought
their
tribe
would
have
wonderful
luck
wherever
they
went
the
women
put
a
pot
upon
the
fire
ready
for
supper
everybody
treated
me
very
much
to
my
annoyance
as
though
i
were
a
fairy
child
whenever
i
spoke
they
bowed
and
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
crying
out
in
their
wild
language
till
i
could
have
boxed
their
ears
when
supper
was
ready
they
brought
me
to
the
place
of
honour
by
the
fire
and
fed
me
with
all
the
delicacies
of
the
gipsy
race
we
had
hedgehog
baked
in
a
clay
cover
though
i
did
not
much
like
him
and
then
a
stew
of
poultry
and
pheasant
both
stolen
i
afraid
with
bread
baked
in
the
ashes
and
wonderful
tea
which
they
said
cost
eighteen
shillings
a
pound
they
annoyed
me
very
much
by
the
way
in
which
they
bowed
and
smirked
but
they
really
meant
to
be
kind
and
i
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
while
i
was
with
them
i
should
be
practically
safe
from
the
runners
and
yeomanry
after
supper
they
made
me
up
a
bed
in
the
waggon
the
next
morning
before
daybreak
we
started
off
horses
waggon
and
all
away
towards
the
west
going
to
portsmouth
fair
the
man
said
to
sell
their
horses
i
had
not
been
very
long
among
the
gipsies
when
i
discovered
that
i
was
as
much
a
prisoner
as
a
pet
they
would
never
let
me
out
of
their
sight
if
i
tried
to
get
away
by
myself
one
of
the
children
or
a
young
woman
would
follow
me
or
rather
come
in
the
same
direction
and
pretend
not
to
be
following
me
but
all
the
time
noting
where
i
went
and
heading
me
off
carefully
if
i
went
too
far
from
the
caravan
before
the
end
of
the
first
day
i
was
wondering
how
it
would
all
finish
and
whether
they
meant
to
make
a
gipsy
of
me
they
were
very
careful
not
to
let
me
be
seen
by
other
travellers
when
the
road
was
clear
they
would
let
me
follow
the
caravan
on
foot
but
when
people
drove
past
us
and
whenever
we
came
to
a
village
they
always
avoided
the
big
towns
they
hurried
me
into
the
waggon
and
kept
me
from
peeping
out
at
night
when
we
pitched
our
camp
after
a
long
journey
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
hours
they
gave
me
a
bed
inside
the
caravan
and
the
elderly
chief
laid
his
blankets
on
the
waggon
floor
between
my
bed
and
the
door
so
that
i
should
not
get
out
i
lived
with
the
gipsies
in
this
way
for
three
whole
days
i
did
not
like
it
any
better
as
time
went
on
i
kept
thinking
of
how
i
should
escape
and
worrying
about
the
anxiety
at
home
now
that
my
letter
must
have
reached
them
i
did
not
think
any
more
about
the
police
i
felt
that
they
would
give
me
no
more
trouble
but
my
distress
at
not
being
able
to
get
away
from
these
gipsies
was
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
i
made
a
dash
for
freedom
but
the
chief
soon
caught
me
and
brought
me
back
evidently
very
much
displeased
and
muttering
something
about
stealing
the
red
coat
about
midday
on
the
fourth
day
as
we
were
passing
through
a
village
it
chanced
that
a
drove
of
sheep
blocked
up
the
road
the
caravan
stopped
and
i
managed
to
get
down
from
the
waggon
with
my
gaoler
to
see
what
was
happening
in
the
road
the
sheep
were
very
wild
and
the
drover
was
a
boy
who
did
not
know
how
to
drive
them
the
way
was
blocked
for
a
good
ten
minutes
so
that
i
had
time
to
look
about
me
while
we
waited
a
drove
up
with
two
people
inside
it
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
naval
sailors
white
trousers
blue
short
natty
jackets
with
red
and
green
ribbons
in
the
seams
and
with
huge
clubbed
pigtails
under
their
black
glazed
hats
one
of
them
was
evidently
ill
for
he
lay
back
against
the
backboard
and
did
not
speak
i
noticed
also
that
he
had
not
been
to
sea
for
a
long
time
as
his
beard
was
long
and
unkempt
the
other
who
drove
the
cart
was
a
man
very
short
and
broad
with
a
thick
black
stubble
on
his
cheeks
he
was
a
hearty
person
with
a
voice
like
a
roar
they
had
rigged
up
union
jacks
on
the
donkey
blinkers
they
had
a
pilot
jack
upon
the
shaft
and
a
white
ensign
on
a
flagpole
tied
to
the
backboard
the
body
of
the
cart
was
all
sprigged
out
with
streamers
of
ribbon
as
thick
as
horses
tails
and
there
were
placards
fixed
to
the
sides
of
the
donkey
collar
they
were
clumsily
scrawled
as
follows
pity
the
braiv
english
seamen
wonded
in
the
wars
help
them
as
can
not
help
theirselves
we
have
bled
for
our
nativland
nelson
and
bronte
this
wonderful
conveyance
pulled
up
among
the
sheep
the
man
stood
upright
in
the
cart
called
for
three
cheers
and
at
once
began
to
roar
out
the
ballad
of
the
battle
of
belle
isle
at
the
battle
of
belle
isle
i
was
there
all
the
while
etc
everybody
clustered
round
to
listen
and
to
admire
the
turnout
i
could
not
get
very
near
to
the
cart
because
of
the
press
but
i
noticed
quite
suddenly
that
the
sick
man
was
staring
rather
hard
at
me
from
under
the
rim
of
his
glazed
hat
which
was
jammed
down
over
his
eyes
the
eyes
seemed
familiar
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
figure
covered
up
as
it
was
with
the
rough
beard
and
with
a
it
reminded
me
of
marah
somehow
and
yet
it
could
not
possibly
be
marah
and
yet
the
man
was
staring
hard
at
me
a
countryman
came
out
of
an
inn
with
a
mug
of
drink
for
the
singer
who
checked
his
song
at
about
the
stanza
to
take
the
mug
with
a
thank
ye
mate
and
hand
it
to
his
sick
friend
the
sick
man
took
the
mug
with
his
left
hand
opening
the
fingers
curiously
and
still
looking
hard
at
me
my
heart
gave
a
great
jump
for
there
were
three
blue
rings
tattooed
on
one
of
the
fingers
the
man
waved
his
mug
towards
me
hoo
hoo
hoo
he
cried
imitating
an
owl
with
his
weak
voice
hoo
hoo
hoo
then
he
clapped
his
right
hand
across
his
mouth
to
warn
me
to
be
silent
and
drank
with
a
bow
to
the
giver
it
marah
after
all
at
this
moment
the
caravan
started
and
the
man
urged
me
to
enter
the
waggon
again
i
did
so
but
as
i
turned
away
marah
smiled
in
an
absurd
manner
at
me
and
bowed
three
times
making
everybody
laugh
that
made
me
feel
sure
that
he
would
help
me
to
escape
and
to
get
home
again
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
trick
of
dressing
up
as
a
braiv
english
seaman
wonded
in
the
war
had
the
people
known
in
what
wars
he
had
been
wounded
they
would
not
have
been
so
free
with
their
kindness
perhaps
it
occurred
to
me
that
marah
had
made
the
owl
cry
or
night
signal
to
show
me
that
i
might
expect
him
at
night
so
when
the
gipsies
went
to
bed
that
night
i
lay
awake
among
them
pretending
to
be
fast
asleep
it
was
very
dark
shut
up
in
the
waggon
the
gipsies
slept
heavily
and
i
could
hear
the
horses
outside
cropping
on
the
grass
and
snorting
once
or
twice
i
heard
a
clock
strike
very
far
away
then
i
fell
asleep
i
think
in
spite
of
my
excitement
i
woke
with
a
start
because
just
outside
the
waggon
came
the
wild
crying
of
an
owl
and
then
at
that
instant
a
banging
of
guns
and
pistols
a
voice
cried
out
the
horses
save
the
horses
some
one
screamed
help
help
in
a
falsetto
more
guns
banged
and
cracked
and
i
heard
a
rush
of
hoofs
as
the
drove
of
horses
stampeded
the
gipsies
in
the
waggon
rushed
out
as
one
man
to
save
the
precious
horses
i
rushed
out
after
them
and
there
was
marah
with
his
friend
crouched
under
the
waggon
waiting
for
me
well
jim
he
said
nip
this
way
quick
we
have
a
suit
of
clothes
all
ready
for
you
so
they
hurried
me
away
to
their
little
cart
where
i
found
a
suit
which
i
was
glad
to
put
on
as
of
course
i
never
wore
the
precious
red
suit
in
bed
those
were
good
said
marah
friend
they
made
the
horses
run
yes
said
marah
i
knew
we
could
clear
the
gipsies
out
of
the
way
and
get
jim
clear
well
jim
my
son
i
not
strong
enough
to
talk
much
i
reckon
i
have
done
with
since
i
got
this
slug
in
my
chest
but
here
we
are
again
bound
home
my
son
with
not
much
shot
in
the
locker
you
be
quiet
said
his
friend
you
be
getting
your
wound
bad
get
up
neddy
we
trotted
off
to
a
little
inn
which
stood
at
some
distance
from
the
gipsies
camp
the
next
morning
after
a
comfortable
night
in
bed
i
asked
marah
how
he
had
escaped
he
told
me
that
when
the
lugger
drove
ashore
one
or
two
smugglers
who
had
hidden
in
the
dunes
crept
down
to
her
and
carried
him
ashore
the
two
others
the
drunkards
were
too
noisy
to
bring
off
they
were
captured
and
condemned
to
serve
in
the
navy
marah
wound
was
not
very
severe
but
he
had
had
a
great
shock
and
would
not
be
able
to
exert
himself
for
many
weeks
an
old
smuggler
the
man
had
dressed
his
wound
for
him
and
had
then
disguised
him
as
i
saw
him
with
a
beard
and
naval
clothes
one
of
the
many
captains
sharp
had
advanced
money
for
the
journey
home
but
to
avoid
suspicion
they
had
rigged
up
their
and
worked
their
way
as
poor
singers
and
now
said
marah
i
heard
tell
in
kent
that
you
written
home
by
the
a
full
five
days
ago
well
jim
we
near
the
here
i
reckon
your
friends
be
coming
to
see
you
by
coach
if
we
go
out
into
the
road
to
the
yonder
where
they
change
horses
and
wait
i
reckon
you
be
able
to
save
them
some
of
their
journey
hey
sally
he
cried
to
the
waitress
what

buttons
the
clock
struck
ten
it
was
a
fair
sunny
summer
day
with
a
brisk
wind
blowing
when
we
ranged
ourselves
across
the
road
outside
the
bold
sawyer
the
sounding
in
the
distance
was
drawing
rapidly
nearer
we
could
hear
the
rhythm
of
the
sixteen
hoofs
presently
the
horses
swung
round
the
corner
we
saw
the
coachman
flick
his
leaders
so
that
he
might
dash
up
to
the
inn
in
style
then
as
they
galloped
up
i
saw
two
figures
sitting
outside
well
muffled
up
they
were
hugh

mrs
cottier
we
had
flags
in
our
hands
so
we
waved
them
and
