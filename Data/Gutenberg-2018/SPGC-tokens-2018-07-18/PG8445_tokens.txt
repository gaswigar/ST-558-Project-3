look
back
on
happiness
i
i
have
gone
to
the
forest
not
because
i
am
offended
about
anything
or
very
unhappy
about
men
evil
ways
but
since
the
forest
will
not
come
to
me
i
must
go
to
it
that
is
all
i
have
not
gone
this
time
as
a
slave
and
a
vagabond
i
have
money
enough
and
am
overfed
stupefied
with
success
and
good
fortune
if
you
understand
that
i
have
left
the
world
as
a
sultan
leaves
rich
food
and
harems
and
flowers
and
clothes
himself
in
a
hair
shirt
really
i
could
make
quite
a
song
and
dance
about
it
for
i
mean
to
roam
and
think
and
make
great
irons
nietzsche
no
doubt
would
have
spoken
thus
the
last
word
i
spake
unto
men
achieved
their
praise
and
they
nodded
but
it
was
my
last
word
and
i
went
into
the
forest
for
then
did
i
comprehend
the
truth
that
my
speech
must
needs
be
dishonest
or
foolish
but
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
i
simply
went
to
the
forest
you
must
not
believe
that
nothing
ever
happens
here
the
snowflakes
drift
down
just
as
they
do
in
the
city
and
the
birds
and
beasts
scurry
about
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
i
could
send
solemn
stories
from
this
place
but
i
do
not
i
have
sought
the
forest
for
solitude
and
for
the
sake
of
my
great
irons
for
i
have
great
irons
which
lie
within
me
and
grow
so
i
deal
with
myself
accordingly
suppose
i
were
to
meet
a
buck
reindeer
one
day
then
i
might
say
to
myself
great
heavens
this
is
a
buck
reindeer
he
dangerous
but
if
then
i
should
be
too
frightened
i
might
tell
myself
a
comforting
lie
and
say
it
was
a
calf
or
some
feathered
beast
you
say
nothing
happens
here
one
day
i
saw
two
lapps
meet
a
boy
and
a
girl
at
first
they
behaved
as
people
do
they
said
to
each
other
and
smiled
but
immediately
after
both
fell
at
full
length
in
the
snow
and
were
gone
from
my
sight
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
i
thought
you
better
see
to
them
they
may
be
smothered
in
the
snow
but
then
they
got
up
and
went
their
separate
ways
in
all
my
weatherbeaten
days
i
have
never
seen
such
a
greeting
as
that
day
and
night
i
live
in
a
deserted
hut
of
peat
into
which
i
must
crawl
on
my
hands
and
knees
someone
must
have
built
it
long
ago
and
used
it
for
lack
of
a
better
perhaps
a
man
who
was
in
hiding
a
man
who
concealed
himself
here
for
a
few
autumn
days
there
are
two
of
us
in
the
hut
that
is
if
you
regard
madame
as
a
person
otherwise
there
is
only
one
madame
is
a
mouse
i
live
with
to
whom
i
have
given
this
honorary
title
she
eats
everything
i
put
aside
for
her
in
the
nooks
and
corners
and
sometimes
she
sits
watching
me
when
i
first
came
there
was
stale
straw
in
the
hut
which
madame
by
all
means
was
allowed
to
keep
for
my
own
bed
i
cut
fresh
pine
twigs
as
is
fitting
i
have
an
ax
and
a
saw
and
the
necessary
crockery
and
i
have
a
sleeping
bag
of
sheepskin
with
the
wool
inside
i
keep
a
fire
burning
in
the
fireplace
all
night
and
my
shirt
which
hangs
by
it
smells
of
fresh
resin
in
the
morning
when
i
want
coffee
i
go
out
fill
the
kettle
with
clean
snow
and
hang
it
over
the
fire
till
the
snow
turns
to
water
is
this
a
life
worth
living
there
you
have
betrayed
yourself
this
is
a
life
you
do
not
understand
yes
your
home
is
in
the
city
and
you
have
furnished
it
with
vanities
with
pictures
and
books
but
you
have
a
wife
and
a
servant
and
a
hundred
expenses
asleep
or
awake
you
must
keep
pace
with
the
world
and
are
never
at
peace
i
have
peace
you
are
welcome
to
your
intellectual
pastimes
and
books
and
art
and
newspapers
welcome
too
to
your
bars
and
your
whisky
that
only
makes
me
ill
here
am
i
in
the
forest
quite
content
if
you
ask
me
intellectual
questions
and
try
to
trip
me
up
then
i
will
reply
for
example
that
god
is
the
origin
of
all
things
and
that
truly
men
are
mere
specks
and
atoms
in
the
universe
you
are
no
wiser
than
i
but
if
you
should
go
so
far
as
to
ask
me
what
is
eternity
then
i
know
quite
as
much
in
this
matter
too
and
reply
thus
eternity
is
merely
unborn
time
nothing
but
unborn
time
my
friend
come
here
to
me
and
i
will
take
a
mirror
from
my
pocket
and
reflect
the
sun
on
your
face
my
friend
you
lie
in
bed
till
ten
or
eleven
in
the
morning
yet
you
are
weary
exhausted
when
you
get
up
i
see
you
in
my
mind
eye
as
you
go
out
into
the
street
the
morning
has
dawned
too
early
on
your
blinking
eyes
i
rise
at
five
quite
refreshed
it
is
still
dark
outdoors
yet
there
is
enough
to
look
at
the
moon
the
stars
the
clouds
and
the
weather
portents
for
the
day
i
prophesy
the
weather
for
many
hours
ahead
in
what
key
do
the
winds
whistle
is
the
crack
of
the
ice
in
the
glimma
light
and
dry
or
deep
and
long
these
are
splendid
portents
and
as
it
grows
lighter
i
add
the
visible
signs
to
the
audible
ones
and
learn
still
more
then
a
narrow
streak
of
daylight
appears
far
down
in
the
east
the
stars
fade
from
the
sky
and
soon
light
reigns
over
all
a
crow
flies
over
the
woods
and
i
warn
madame
not
to
go
outside
the
hut
or
she
will
be
devoured
but
if
fresh
snow
has
fallen
the
trees
and
copses
and
the
great
rocks
take
on
giant
unearthly
shapes
as
though
they
had
come
from
another
world
in
the
night
a
pine
with
its
root
torn
up
looks
like
a
witch
petrified
in
the
act
of
performing
strange
rites
here
a
hare
has
sprung
by
and
yonder
are
the
tracks
of
a
solitary
reindeer
i
shake
out
my
sleeping
bag
and
after
hanging
it
high
in
a
tree
to
escape
madame
who
eats
everything
i
follow
the
tracks
of
the
reindeer
into
the
forest
it
has
jogged
along
without
haste
but
toward
a
definite
goal
straight
east
to
meet
the
day
by
the
banks
of
the
skiel
which
is
so
rapid
that
its
waters
never
freeze
the
reindeer
has
stopped
to
drink
to
scrape
the
hillside
for
moss
to
rest
a
while
and
then
moved
on
and
perhaps
what
this
reindeer
has
done
is
all
the
knowledge
and
experience
i
gain
that
day
it
seems
much
to
me
the
days
are
short
at
two
i
am
already
strolling
homeward
in
the
deep
twilight
with
the
good
still
night
approaching
then
i
begin
to
cook
i
have
a
great
deal
of
meat
stored
in
three
drifts
of
snow
in
fact
i
have
something
even
better
eight
fat
cheeses
of
reindeer
milk
to
eat
with
butter
and
while
the
pot
is
boiling
i
lie
down
and
gaze
at
the
fire
till
i
fall
asleep
i
take
my
midday
nap
before
my
meal
and
when
i
waken
the
food
is
cooked
filling
the
hut
with
an
aroma
of
meat
and
resin
madame
darts
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
and
at
length
gets
her
share
i
eat
and
light
my
the
day
is
at
an
end
all
has
been
well
and
i
have
had
no
unpleasantness
in
the
great
silence
surrounding
me
i
am
the
only
adult
roaming
man
this
makes
me
bigger
and
more
important
god
kin
and
i
believe
the
irons
within
me
are
progressing
well
for
god
does
great
things
for
his
kin
i
lie
thinking
of
the
reindeer
the
path
it
took
what
it
did
by
the
river
and
how
it
continued
on
its
journey
there
under
the
trees
it
has
nibbled
and
its
horns
have
rubbed
against
the
bark
leaving
their
marks
there
an
osier
bed
has
forced
it
to
turn
aside
but
just
beyond
it
has
straightened
its
path
and
continued
east
once
more
all
this
i
think
of
and
you
have
you
read
in
a
newspaper
which
disagrees
with
another
newspaper
what
the
public
in
norway
is
thinking
of
insurance
ii
on
stormy
days
i
sit
indoors
and
find
something
to
occupy
my
time
perhaps
i
write
letters
to
some
acquaintance
or
other
telling
him
i
am
well
and
hope
to
hear
the
same
from
him
but
i
can
not
post
the
letters
and
they
grow
older
every
day
not
that
it
matters
i
have
tied
the
letters
to
a
string
that
hangs
from
the
ceiling
to
prevent
madame
from
gnawing
at
them
one
day
a
man
came
to
the
hut
he
walked
swiftly
and
stealthily
his
clothes
were
ordinary
and
he
wore
no
collar
for
he
was
a
laboring
man
he
carried
a
sack
and
i
wondered
what
could
be
in
it
good
morning
we
said
to
each
other
fine
weather
in
the
woods
i
did
expect
to
find
anybody
in
the
hut
said
the
man
his
manner
was
at
once
forceful
and
discontented
he
flung
down
the
sack
without
humility
he
may
know
something
about
me
i
thought
since
he
is
such
a
man
have
you
lived
here
long
he
asked
and
are
you
leaving
soon
is
the
hut
yours
perhaps
i
asked
in
my
turn
then
he
looked
at
me
because
if
the
hut
is
yours
that
another
matter
i
said
but
i
intend
like
a
pickpocket
to
take
it
with
me
when
i
leave
i
spoke
gently
and
jestingly
to
avoid
committing
a
blunder
by
my
speech
but
i
had
said
quite
the
right
thing
the
man
at
once
lost
his
assurance
somehow
i
had
made
him
feel
that
i
knew
more
about
him
than
he
knew
about
me
when
i
asked
him
to
come
in
he
was
grateful
and
said
thank
you
but
i
afraid
i
get
snow
all
over
your
floor
then
he
took
special
pains
to
wipe
his
boots
clean
and
bringing
his
sack
with
him
crawled
in
i
could
give
you
some
coffee
i
said
you
should
trouble
on
my
account
he
replied
wiping
his
face
and
panting
with
the
heat
though
i
been
walking
all
night
are
you
crossing
the
fjeld
that
depends
i
do
suppose
there
work
to
be
got
on
a
winter
day
on
the
other
side
either
i
gave
him
coffee
got
anything
to
eat
he
said
it
a
shame
to
ask
you
a
round
of
i
had
no
chance
to
bring
food
with
me
yes
i
got
bread
butter
and
reindeer
cheese
help
yourself
it
not
so
easy
for
a
lot
of
people
in
the
winter
said
the
man
as
he
ate
could
you
take
some
letters
to
the
village
for
me
i
asked
i
pay
you
for
it
oh
no
i
could
do
that
the
man
replied
i
afraid
impossible
i
must
cross
the
fjeld
now
i
heard
there
work
in
hilling
in
the
hilling
forest
so
i
ca
must
get
his
back
up
a
bit
again
i
thought
he
just
sits
now
there
without
any
guts
at
all
in
the
end
he
start
begging
for
a
few
coppers
i
felt
his
sack
and
said
what
this
you
lugging
about
with
you
heavy
things
mind
your
own
business
was
his
instant
retort
as
he
drew
the
sack
closer
to
him
i
was
going
to
steal
any
of
it
i
no
thief
i
said
jesting
again
i
do
care
what
you
are
he
muttered
the
day
wore
on
since
i
had
a
visitor
i
had
no
desire
to
go
to
the
woods
but
wanted
to
sit
and
talk
to
him
and
ask
him
questions
he
was
a
very
ordinary
man
of
no
great
interest
to
the
irons
in
my
fire
with
dirty
hands
uneducated
and
uninteresting
in
his
speech
probably
he
had
stolen
the
things
in
his
sack
later
i
learned
that
he
was
quick
in
much
small
knowledge
that
life
had
taught
him
he
complained
that
his
heels
felt
cold
and
took
off
his
boots
and
no
wonder
he
felt
cold
for
where
the
heels
of
his
stockings
should
have
been
there
were
only
great
holes
he
borrowed
a
knife
to
cut
away
the
ragged
edges
and
then
drew
on
the
stockings
again
back
to
front
so
that
the
torn
soles
came
over
his
instep
when
he
had
put
on
his
boots
again
he
said
there
now
it
nice
and
warm
he
did
no
harm
if
he
took
down
the
saw
and
the
ax
from
their
hooks
to
inspect
them
he
put
them
back
again
where
he
had
found
them
when
he
examined
the
letters
trying
perhaps
to
read
the
addresses
he
did
not
let
them
go
carelessly
leaving
them
to
swing
back
and
forth
but
held
the
string
so
that
it
hung
motionless
i
had
no
reason
to
complain
about
him
he
had
his
midday
meal
with
me
and
when
he
had
eaten
he
said
do
you
mind
if
i
cut
myself
some
pine
twigs
to
sit
on
he
went
out
to
cut
off
some
soft
pine
and
we
had
to
move
madame
straw
to
make
room
for
the
man
inside
the
hut
then
we
lay
on
our
twigs
burning
resin
and
talking
he
was
still
there
in
the
afternoon
still
lying
down
as
though
to
postpone
the
time
of
his
leaving
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
he
went
to
the
low
doorway
and
looked
out
at
the
weather
then
turning
his
head
back
he
asked
do
you
think
there
be
snow
tonight
you
ask
me
questions
and
i
ask
you
questions
i
said
but
it
looks
like
snow
the
smoke
is
blowing
down
it
made
him
uneasy
to
think
it
might
snow
and
he
said
he
had
better
leave
that
night
suddenly
he
flew
into
a
rage
for
as
i
lay
there
i
stretched
so
that
my
hand
accidentally
touched
his
sack
again
you
leave
me
alone
he
shouted
tearing
the
sack
from
my
grasp
you
touch
that
sack
or
i
show
you
i
replied
that
i
had
meant
nothing
by
it
and
had
no
intention
of
stealing
anything
from
him
stealing
eh
what
of
it
i
not
afraid
of
you
and
do
you
go
thinking
i
am
look
here
what
i
got
in
the
bag
said
the
man
and
began
to
rummage
in
it
and
to
show
me
the
contents
three
pairs
of
new
mittens
some
sort
of
thick
cloth
for
garments
a
bag
of
barley
a
side
of
bacon
sixteen
rolls
of
tobacco
and
a
few
large
lumps
of
sugar
candy
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
was
perhaps
half
a
bushel
of
coffee
beans
no
doubt
it
was
all
from
the
general
stores
with
the
exception
of
a
heap
of
broken
which
might
have
been
stolen
elsewhere
so
you
got
after
all
i
said
if
you
knew
anything
about
it
you
would
talk
like
that
the
man
replied
when
i
crossing
the
fjeld
on
foot
walking
and
walking
i
need
food
to
put
in
my
belly
it
blasphemy
to
listen
to
you
neatly
and
carefully
he
put
everything
back
into
the
sack
each
article
in
its
turn
he
took
pains
to
build
up
the
rolls
of
tobacco
round
the
bacon
to
protect
the
cloth
from
grease
stains
you
might
buy
this
cloth
from
me
he
said
let
you
have
it
cheap
it
duffle
it
only
gets
in
my
way
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
i
asked
there
enough
for
a
whole
suit
of
clothes
maybe
more
he
said
to
himself
as
he
spread
it
out
i
said
to
the
man
truly
you
come
here
into
the
forest
bringing
with
you
life
and
the
world
and
intellectual
values
and
news
let
us
talk
a
little
tell
me
something
are
you
afraid
your
footprints
will
be
visible
tomorrow
if
there
fresh
snow
tonight
that
my
business
i
crossed
the
field
before
and
i
know
many
paths
he
muttered
i
let
you
have
the
cloth
for
a
few
crowns
i
shook
my
head
so
the
man
again
neatly
folded
the
cloth
and
put
it
back
in
the
bag
exactly
as
though
it
belonged
to
him
i
cut
it
up
into
material
for
trousers
then
the
pieces
wo
be
so
large
and
i
be
able
to
sell
it
you
better
leave
enough
for
a
whole
suit
in
one
piece
i
said
and
cut
up
the
rest
for
trousers
you
think
so
yes
maybe
you
right
we
calculated
how
much
would
be
necessary
for
a
grown
man
suit
and
took
down
the
string
from
which
the
letters
hung
to
measure
our
own
clothes
so
as
to
be
sure
to
get
the
measurements
right
then
we
cut
into
the
edge
of
the
cloth
and
tore
it
across
in
addition
to
one
complete
suit
there
was
enough
left
for
two
pairs
of
trousers
then
the
man
offered
to
sell
me
other
things
out
of
his
sack
and
i
bought
some
coffee
and
a
few
rolls
of
tobacco
he
put
the
money
away
in
a
leather
purse
and
i
saw
how
empty
the
purse
was
and
the
circumstantial
and
fashion
in
which
he
put
the
money
away
afterward
feeling
the
outside
of
his
pocket
you
have
been
able
to
sell
me
much
i
said
but
i
do
need
any
more
than
that
business
is
business
said
he
i
do
complain
it
was
quite
decent
of
him
while
he
was
making
ready
to
depart
and
clearing
his
bed
of
pine
needles
out
of
the
way
i
thought
pityingly
of
his
sordid
little
theft
stealing
because
he
was
needy
a
side
of
bacon
and
a
length
of
cloth
which
he
was
trying
to
sell
in
the
forest
theft
has
indeed
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
great
moment
this
is
because
legal
punishment
for
misdemeanors
of
all
kinds
has
also
ceased
to
be
of
great
moment
it
is
only
a
dull
human
punishment
the
religious
element
has
been
removed
from
the
law
and
a
local
magistrate
is
no
longer
a
man
of
mystic
power
i
well
remember
the
last
time
i
heard
a
judge
explain
the
meaning
of
the
oath
as
it
should
be
explained
it
chilled
us
all
to
the
bone
to
hear
him
we
need
some
witchcraft
again
and
the
sixth
book
of
moses
and
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
signing
your
name
in
the
blood
of
a
newly
baptized
child
steal
a
sack
of
money
and
silver
treasure
if
you
like
and
hide
the
sack
in
the
hills
where
on
autumn
evenings
a
blue
flame
will
hover
over
the
spot
but
do
come
to
me
with
three
pairs
of
mittens
and
a
side
of
household
bacon
the
man
no
longer
worried
about
the
sack
leaving
it
behind
he
crawled
out
of
the
hut
to
study
the
weather
the
coffee
and
tobacco
i
had
bought
i
put
back
into
the
sack
for
i
did
not
need
them
when
he
returned
he
said
i
think
after
all
i
better
stop
the
night
here
with
you
if
you
mind
in
the
evening
he
gave
no
indication
of
being
prepared
to
contribute
any
of
his
own
food
i
cooked
some
coffee
and
gave
him
some
dry
bread
to
eat
with
it
you
should
have
expenses
for
me
he
said
then
he
began
to
rummage
in
his
sack
again
pushing
the
bacon
well
down
so
that
the
cloth
might
not
be
stained
by
it
after
this
he
took
off
his
leather
belt
and
put
it
round
the
sack
with
a
loop
to
carry
over
one
shoulder
now
if
i
take
the
neck
of
the
sack
over
the
other
shoulder
i
find
it
easier
to
carry
he
said
i
gave
him
my
letters
to
post
on
the
other
side
of
the
fjeld
and
he
stowed
them
away
safely
slapping
the
outside
of
his
pocket
afterward
i
also
gave
him
a
special
envelope
in
which
to
keep
the
money
for
the
stamps
and
tied
it
to
the
neck
of
the
sack
where
do
you
live
i
asked
him
where
can
a
poor
man
live
of
course
i
live
by
the
sea
i
sorry
to
say
i
have
a
wife
and
children
no
use
denying
it
how
many
children
have
you
four
one
got
a
crippled
arm
and
the
others
there
something
wrong
with
all
of
them
it
not
easy
for
a
poor
devil
my
wife
ill
and
a
few
days
ago
she
thought
she
was
dying
and
wanted
communion
a
sad
note
crept
into
his
voice
but
the
note
was
false
he
was
telling
me
a
pack
of
lies
when
they
came
to
look
for
him
from
the
village
no
christian
would
have
the
heart
to
accuse
a
man
with
such
a
large
and
sick
family
this
no
doubt
was
his
meaning
man
oh
man
thou
art
worse
than
a
mouse
i
questioned
him
no
further
but
asked
him
to
sing
something
a
ballad
or
a
song
since
we
had
nothing
else
to
do
i
no
heart
to
sing
now
he
replied
except
possibly
a
hymn
all
right
sing
a
hymn
then
not
now
i
like
to
do
you
a
favor
but
his
uneasiness
was
rising
a
little
later
he
took
his
sack
and
went
out
well
he
gone
i
thought
but
he
has
said
the
customary
i
glad
i
come
into
the
forest
i
thought
this
is
my
home
and
from
this
day
forth
no
mother
son
shall
come
within
my
walls
again
i
made
an
elaborate
agreement
with
myself
that
i
should
have
no
more
truck
with
men
madame
come
here
i
said
i
esteem
you
highly
and
herewith
madame
i
undertake
to
enter
upon
a
union
with
you
for
life
half
an
hour
later
the
man
returned
he
carried
no
sack
i
thought
you
gone
i
said
gone
i
not
a
dog
he
replied
i
met
people
before
this
and
i
say
good
morning
when
i
come
and
when
i
go
you
sneer
at
me
you
know
what
have
you
done
with
the
sack
i
carried
it
part
of
the
way
his
concealing
the
sack
in
case
anyone
should
come
proved
he
had
forethought
for
it
was
easier
to
get
away
without
a
burden
on
one
back
to
stop
him
from
telling
me
any
more
lies
about
his
poverty
i
said
i
expect
you
raised
plenty
of
dust
in
your
day
still
do
for
that
matter
well
i
do
what
i
can
he
replied
cheerfully
i
can
lift
a
barrel
easier
than
most
and
nobody
was
able
to
dance
me
off
the
floor
last
christmas
hush
is
that
someone
coming
we
listened
his
eyes
darted
toward
the
entrance
and
in
a
moment
he
had
chosen
to
meet
danger
halfway
he
was
taut
and
splendid
i
could
see
his
jaw
working
it
nothing
i
said
resolute
and
strong
as
a
bull
he
crawled
out
of
the
hut
and
was
gone
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
returned
breathing
heavily
he
said
it
nothing
we
lay
down
for
the
night
in
god
name
he
said
as
he
settled
himself
on
his
pine
bed
i
fell
asleep
at
once
and
for
some
time
slept
deeply
but
during
the
night
restlessness
seized
on
the
man
again
peace
be
with
you
i
heard
him
mutter
as
he
crawled
out
of
the
hut
in
the
morning
i
burned
the
man
bed
of
pine
needles
it
made
a
lively
fire
of
crackling
pine
in
the
hut
outside
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
iii
there
is
nothing
like
being
left
alone
again
to
walk
peacefully
with
oneself
in
the
woods
to
boil
one
coffee
and
fill
one
pipe
and
to
think
idly
and
slowly
as
one
does
it
there
now
i
fill
the
kettle
with
snow
i
think
and
now
i
crushing
the
coffee
beans
with
a
stone
later
i
must
beat
my
sleeping
bag
well
in
the
snow
and
get
the
wool
white
again
there
is
nothing
in
this
of
literature
or
great
novels
or
public
opinion
does
it
matter
but
then
i
have
been
toiling
just
to
get
this
coffee
into
my
life
literature
when
rome
ruled
the
world
she
was
no
more
than
greece
apprentice
in
literature
yet
rome
ruled
the
world
let
us
look
too
at
another
country
we
know
it
fought
a
war
of
independence
the
glory
of
which
still
shines
and
it
brought
forth
the
greatest
school
of
painting
in
the
world
yet
it
had
no
literature
and
has
none
today
day
by
day
i
grow
more
knowing
in
the
ways
of
the
trees
and
the
moss
and
the
snow
on
the
ground
and
all
things
are
my
friends
the
stump
of
a
fir
tree
stands
thawing
in
the
sun
i
feel
my
familiarity
with
it
grow
and
sometimes
i
stand
there
loving
it
for
there
is
something
in
it
that
moves
my
soul
the
bark
is
badly
broken
one
winter
in
the
deep
snow
the
tree
must
have
been
crippled
and
now
it
points
upward
long
and
naked
i
put
myself
in
its
place
and
look
at
it
with
pity
my
eyes
perhaps
have
the
simple
animal
expression
that
human
eyes
had
in
the
age
of
the
mastodons
no
doubt
you
will
seize
this
opportunity
to
mock
me
for
there
are
many
amusing
things
you
can
say
about
me
and
this
stump
of
a
fir
yet
in
your
heart
you
know
that
i
am
superior
to
you
in
this
as
in
everything
else
with
the
single
exception
that
i
have
not
your
conventional
accomplishments
nor
have
i
passed
examinations
about
the
forest
and
the
earth
you
can
teach
me
nothing
for
here
i
feel
what
no
man
else
has
felt
sometimes
i
take
the
wrong
direction
and
lose
my
way
yes
truly
this
may
happen
sometimes
but
i
do
not
begin
to
twist
and
lose
myself
outside
my
very
door
like
the
children
of
the
city
i
am
twelve
miles
out
far
up
the
opposite
bank
of
the
skjel
river
before
i
begin
to
get
lost
and
then
only
on
a
sunless
day
with
perhaps
thick
wild
snow
coming
down
and
no
north
or
south
in
the
sky
then
you
must
know
the
special
marks
of
this
kind
of
tree
and
that
the
galipot
of
the
pine
the
bark
of
deciduous
trees
the
moss
that
grows
at
their
roots
the
angle
of
the
south
and
branches
the
stones
that
are
and
those
that
are
bare
and
the
pattern
of
the
network
of
veins
in
the
leaves
from
all
these
things
while
there
is
daylight
i
can
find
my
way
but
if
the
dusk
falls
i
know
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
get
home
till
the
next
day
how
shall
i
pass
this
night
i
say
to
myself
and
i
roam
about
till
i
find
a
sheltered
spot
the
best
is
a
crag
standing
with
its
back
to
the
wind
here
i
collect
a
few
armfuls
of
pine
needles
button
my
jacket
tight
and
take
a
long
time
to
settle
no
one
who
has
not
tried
it
knows
anything
of
the
fine
pleasure
that
streams
through
the
soul
as
one
sits
in
a
snug
shelter
on
such
a
night
i
light
my
pipe
to
pass
the
time
but
the
tobacco
does
agree
with
me
because
i
have
eaten
so
i
put
some
resin
in
my
mouth
to
chew
as
i
lie
thinking
of
many
things
the
snow
continues
to
fall
outside
if
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
find
a
shelter
facing
the
right
way
the
snowdrifts
will
close
in
over
me
and
form
a
crest
like
a
roof
above
my
retreat
then
i
am
quite
safe
and
may
sleep
or
wake
as
i
please
there
will
be
no
danger
of
freezing
my
feet
two
men
came
to
my
hut
they
were
in
a
great
hurry
and
one
of
them
called
to
me
good
morning
has
a
man
passed
this
way
i
did
like
his
face
i
was
not
his
servant
and
his
question
was
too
stupid
many
people
may
have
passed
this
way
do
you
mean
have
i
a
man
go
by
so
much
for
him
i
meant
what
i
said
the
man
replied
surlily
i
asking
you
in
the
name
of
the
law
oh
i
had
no
desire
for
further
conversation
and
crawled
into
my
hut
the
two
men
followed
me
the
constable
grinned
and
said
did
you
a
man
pass
by
here
yesterday
no
i
said
they
looked
at
each
other
and
took
counsel
together
then
they
left
the
hut
and
returned
to
the
village
i
thought
what
zeal
this
policeman
showed
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
how
he
shone
with
public
spirit
there
will
be
bonuses
for
the
capture
and
transport
of
the
criminal
there
will
be
honor
in
having
carried
out
the
deed
all
mankind
should
adopt
this
man
because
he
is
its
son
created
in
its
image
where
are
the
irons
he
would
rattle
the
links
a
little
and
lift
them
on
his
arm
like
the
train
of
a
riding
skirt
to
make
me
feel
his
terrifying
power
to
put
people
in
irons
i
feel
nothing
and
what
tradesmen
what
kings
of
trade
we
have
today
they
instantly
miss
what
a
man
can
carry
off
in
a
sack
and
notify
the
police
from
now
on
i
begin
to
long
for
the
spring
my
peat
hut
lies
still
too
near
to
mankind
and
i
will
build
myself
another
when
the
frost
has
gone
out
of
the
ground
on
the
other
side
of
the
skjel
i
have
chosen
a
spot
in
the
forest
which
i
think
i
shall
like
it
is
miles
from
the
village
and
eighteen
across
the
fjeld
iv
have
i
said
that
i
was
too
near
men
heaven
help
me
for
some
days
in
succession
i
have
been
taking
strolls
in
the
forest
saying
good
morning
and
pretending
i
was
in
human
company
if
it
was
a
man
i
imagined
beside
me
we
carried
on
a
long
intelligent
conversation
but
if
it
was
a
woman
i
was
polite
let
me
carry
your
parcel
miss
once
it
must
have
been
the
lapp
daughter
i
seemed
to
meet
for
i
flattered
her
most
lavishly
and
offered
to
carry
her
fur
cloak
if
she
would
take
it
off
and
walk
in
her
skin
tut
tut
heaven
help
me
i
am
no
longer
too
near
men
and
probably
i
will
not
build
that
peat
hut
still
further
away
from
them
the
days
grow
longer
and
i
do
not
mind
the
truth
is
that
in
the
winter
i
suffered
privation
and
learned
much
in
order
to
master
myself
it
has
taken
time
and
sometimes
a
resolute
will
so
it
can
not
be
denied
that
i
am
paying
for
my
education
rather
dearly
sometimes
i
have
been
needlessly
stern
with
myself
there
is
a
loaf
of
bread
i
said
it
does
surprise
me
it
interest
me
i
am
used
to
it
but
if
you
see
no
bread
for
twelve
hours
it
will
mean
something
to
you
i
said
and
hid
the
bread
away
that
was
in
the
winter
were
they
dreary
days
no
good
days
my
liberty
was
so
great
that
i
could
do
and
think
as
i
pleased
i
was
alone
the
bear
of
the
forest
but
even
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
no
man
dares
speak
aloud
without
looking
round
rather
he
walks
in
silence
for
a
time
you
console
yourself
that
typically
english
to
be
silent
it
regal
to
be
silent
but
suddenly
you
find
this
has
gone
too
far
your
mouth
begins
to
wake
to
stretch
and
suddenly
to
shout
nonsense
bricks
for
the
palace
the
calf
is
much
stronger
today
perhaps
if
your
voice
is
strong
the
sound
will
carry
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
then
you
feel
a
sting
as
though
after
a
slap
if
only
you
had
kept
your
regal
silence
one
day
the
postman
who
crosses
the
fjeld
once
a
month
came
on
me
just
as
i
had
shouted
what
he
called
from
the
wood
careful
below
i
called
back
to
save
my
face
i
put
out
a
trap
but
with
the
longer
days
my
courage
grows
it
must
be
the
spring
that
causes
this
mysterious
revival
within
me
and
i
no
longer
fear
a
shout
more
or
less
i
needlessly
rattle
my
pots
and
pans
as
i
cook
and
i
sing
at
the
top
of
my
voice
it
is
spring
yesterday
i
stood
on
a
hillock
and
looked
out
across
the
wintry
woods
they
have
a
different
expression
now
they
have
gone
gray
and
bedraggled
and
the
midday
sun
has
thawed
down
the
snow
and
diminished
it
there
are
catkins
everywhere
drifts
of
them
in
the
underbrush
looking
like
letters
of
the
alphabet
piled
in
a
heap
the
moon
rises
the
stars
break
forth
i
am
cold
and
shiver
a
little
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
hut
and
prefer
to
shiver
as
long
as
possible
in
the
winter
i
did
nothing
so
foolish
but
went
home
if
i
was
cold
now
i
tired
of
that
too
it
is
the
spring
the
sky
is
pure
and
cool
lying
wide
open
to
all
the
stars
there
is
a
great
flock
of
worlds
up
in
that
endless
meadow
tiny
teeming
worlds
so
tiny
that
they
are
like
the
sound
of
a
tinkling
bell
as
i
look
at
them
i
can
hear
thousands
of
tiny
bells
yes
certainly
i
am
being
drawn
more
and
more
toward
the
grassy
slopes
of
spring
v
i
fill
the
fireplace
with
pine
wood
hoist
my
belongings
to
my
back
and
leave
the
hut
farewell
madame
that
was
the
end
i
feel
no
pleasure
at
leaving
my
shelter
but
a
touch
of
sadness
as
i
always
do
on
leaving
a
place
that
has
been
my
home
for
some
time
but
all
the
world
stands
outside
calling
to
me
indeed
i
am
like
all
lovers
of
the
woods
and
fields
wordlessly
we
had
agreed
to
meet
and
as
i
sat
there
last
night
i
felt
my
eyes
being
drawn
to
the
door
several
times
i
look
back
at
the
hut
with
the
smoke
rising
up
from
the
chimney
the
smoke
billows
and
waves
to
me
and
i
wave
back
the
silky
pallor
of
the
morning
refreshes
me
in
a
long
blue
haze
over
the
forest
a
slow
dawn
rises
it
looks
like
a
cheerful
piratical
coast
in
the
sky
before
me
the
mountains
are
all
on
my
left
after
a
few
hours
march
i
am
like
new
from
top
to
toe
and
i
press
on
swiftly
i
beat
the
air
with
my
stick
and
it
says
hoo
as
it
swishes
whenever
i
think
i
deserve
it
i
sit
down
and
give
myself
food
no
you
have
not
my
pleasures
in
the
town
i
beat
my
legs
with
my
stick
from
the
sheer
exuberance
of
living
and
nearly
cry
out
i
behave
as
though
the
burden
on
my
back
had
no
weight
taking
needless
leaps
and
overexerting
myself
a
little
but
an
overexertion
to
which
one
is
driven
by
inner
content
is
easy
to
bear
in
my
solitude
many
miles
from
men
and
houses
i
am
in
a
childishly
happy
and
carefree
state
of
mind
which
you
are
incapable
of
understanding
unless
someone
explains
it
to
you
i
play
a
little
game
with
myself
pretending
to
have
discovered
a
remarkable
kind
of
tree
at
first
i
pay
little
attention
then
i
stretch
my
neck
and
contract
my
eyelids
and
gaze
what
i
say
to
myself
surely
it
could
be
i
throw
down
my
burden
and
approach
inspect
the
tree
and
nod
sagely
saying
it
is
a
strange
fabled
tree
that
i
have
discovered
and
i
take
out
my
notebook
and
describe
it
merely
jest
and
happiness
a
queer
little
impulse
to
play
children
have
done
it
before
me
and
here
comes
no
postman
to
surprise
me
as
suddenly
as
i
have
begun
the
game
i
end
it
again
as
children
do
but
for
a
moment
i
was
transported
back
to
the
dear
foolish
bliss
of
childhood
perhaps
it
was
the
anticipation
of
soon
seeing
men
again
that
made
me
playful
and
happy
next
day
just
as
a
raw
mist
descends
on
mountain
and
forest
i
reach
the
lapp
house
i
enter
but
though
i
meet
with
nothing
but
kindness
a
lapp
hut
contains
little
that
is
interesting
there
are
spoons
and
knives
of
bone
on
the
peat
wall
and
a
small
paraffin
lamp
hangs
from
the
roof
the
lapp
himself
is
a
dull
nonentity
who
can
neither
tell
fortunes
nor
conjure
his
daughter
has
gone
across
the
field
she
has
learned
to
read
but
not
to
write
at
the
village
school
the
two
old
people
husband
and
wife
are
fools
the
whole
family
share
a
sort
of
animal
dumbness
if
i
ask
them
a
question
i
may
or
may
not
get
half
a
reply
i
am
not
a
lapp
and
so
they
distrust
me
all
the
afternoon
the
mist
lay
white
on
the
forest
i
slept
a
while
in
the
evening
the
sky
was
clear
again
and
there
were
a
few
degrees
of
frost
i
left
the
hut
the
moon
stood
full
and
silent
above
the
earth
what
untuned
strings
but
where
are
the
birds
all
gone
away
and
what
kind
of
place
is
this
here
where
i
stand
nothing
moves
or
stirs
in
this
world
that
is
dead
no
event
occurs
i
stand
in
a
silvermine
my
eyes
sweep
round
but
i
sorely
miss
a
homely
outline
and
so
he
came
to
a
silver
wood
thus
ran
an
ancient
tale
here
rests
a
song
of
shimmering
fire
as
though
it
were
sung
by
a
starry
choir
and
swift
in
my
youth
i
leap
to
bind
fast
the
troll
the
cunning
male
and
awaken
a
maid
from
her
sleep
today
i
smile
at
childish
tales
old
age
has
made
me
wise
once
proudly
in
prodigal
youth
i
trod
now
by
age
my
foot
is
heavily
shod
yet
my
heart
my
heart
would
fly
i
am
driven
by
fire
and
bound
by
ice
no
rest
nor
repose
have
i
a
shuddering
chill
falls
on
the
night
like
a
cloud
from
the
lungs
in
the
cold
there
passed
a
great
gust
through
the
silver
lace
of
the
woods
like
a
lion
royal
pace
on
paws
that
are
soundless
and
still
it
may
be
a
god
on
his
evening
stroll
the
roots
of
the
forest
thrill
when
i
returned
to
the
hut
the
daughter
had
also
returned
home
and
sat
eating
after
her
long
march
olga
the
lapp
tiny
and
queer
conceived
in
a
snowdrift
in
the
course
of
a
greeting
they
said
and
fell
on
their
noses
she
had
bought
red
and
blue
pieces
of
cloth
at
the
draper
shop
in
the
village
and
no
sooner
had
she
finished
eating
than
she
pushed
the
cups
and
plates
away
and
began
to
embroider
her
sunday
jacket
with
pretty
strips
of
the
cloth
all
the
while
she
never
spoke
a
word
because
a
stranger
was
in
the
room
you
know
me
olga
do
you
mm
but
you
look
so
angry
how
the
snow
track
across
the
fjeld
all
right
i
knew
there
was
a
deserted
hut
the
family
had
once
lived
in
and
asked
how
far
is
it
to
your
old
hut
not
far
said
olga
olga
lapp
has
someone
to
smile
at
surely
even
if
she
will
not
smile
at
me
here
she
sits
in
the
great
forest
pandering
to
her
vanity
and
sewing
wonderful
scrolls
on
her
jacket
on
sunday
no
doubt
she
will
wear
it
to
church
and
meet
the
man
whose
eyes
it
is
meant
to
gladden
i
was
not
anxious
to
stay
any
longer
with
these
small
beings
these
human
grains
of
sand
as
i
had
slept
enough
in
the
afternoon
and
the
moon
was
bright
i
prepared
to
leave
after
laying
in
a
further
supply
of
reindeer
cheese
and
whatever
other
food
i
could
get
i
left
the
hut
but
what
a
surprise
the
bright
moonlight
was
gone
and
the
sky
was
overcast
there
was
no
frost
only
mild
weather
and
wet
woods
it
was
spring
when
olga
lapp
saw
this
she
advised
me
against
leaving
but
why
should
i
listen
to
her
chatter
she
came
with
me
a
little
way
into
the
woods
to
direct
me
then
turned
and
went
back
tiny
and
queer
her
feathers
ruffled
like
a
hen
vi
it
was
difficult
to
advance
never
mind
a
few
hours
later
i
found
myself
high
up
on
the
fjeld
i
must
have
strayed
from
the
path
what
is
that
dark
shape
there
a
mountain
peak
and
that
over
there
another
peak
let
us
pitch
camp
on
the
spot
then
there
was
a
deep
goodness
and
tenderness
about
this
mild
night
i
sat
in
the
dark
recalling
forgotten
memories
of
my
childhood
and
many
experiences
in
this
place
and
that
and
what
a
satisfaction
it
is
too
to
have
money
in
one
pocket
even
if
one
sleeps
in
the
open
during
the
night
i
woke
up
i
found
it
growing
too
warm
for
me
under
my
crag
and
loosened
my
sleeping
bag
it
seemed
to
me
too
that
a
sound
still
hummed
in
my
ear
as
though
i
had
called
out
or
sung
in
my
sleep
suddenly
i
felt
completely
rested
and
turned
to
look
about
me
it
was
dark
and
mild
a
world
the
sky
was
paler
than
the
ring
of
mountains
round
me
i
lay
in
the
center
of
a
city
of
peaks
at
the
foot
of
a
great
cliff
huge
to
the
point
of
deformity
the
wind
began
to
blow
and
suddenly
there
was
a
booming
in
the
distance
then
came
a
streak
of
lightning
and
immediately
after
the
thunder
rolled
down
like
a
gigantic
avalanche
between
the
most
distant
peaks
it
was
matchless
to
lie
there
listening
and
a
supernatural
delight
a
thrill
of
enjoyment
ran
through
me
a
stranger
madness
filled
me
than
i
had
ever
felt
before
and
i
gave
it
expression
by
laughing
aloud
in
wanton
and
humorous
abandon
many
a
thought
ran
through
my
mind
witticisms
alternating
with
moments
of
such
great
sorrow
that
i
lay
sighing
deeply
the
lightning
and
thunder
came
closer
and
it
began
to
rain
a
torrential
rain
the
echoes
were
overpowering
all
nature
was
an
uproar
a
hullabalooing
i
tried
to
conquer
the
night
by
shouting
at
it
lest
mysteriously
it
should
rob
me
of
my
strength
and
leave
me
without
a
will
these
mountains
i
thought
are
sheer
incantations
against
my
journey
great
planted
curses
that
block
my
path
or
perhaps
i
have
only
strayed
into
a
mountains
trade
union
but
i
nod
my
head
repeatedly
that
means
i
am
brave
and
happy
perhaps
after
all
they
are
only
stuffed
mountains
more
lightning
and
thunder
and
torrential
rain
it
felt
as
though
the
echo
had
slapped
me
reverberating
a
hundred
times
through
me
never
mind
i
have
read
about
many
battles
and
been
in
a
rain
of
bullets
before
this
yet
in
a
moment
of
sadness
and
humility
in
the
presence
of
the
powers
about
me
i
weep
and
think
who
am
i
now
among
men
or
am
i
lost
already
am
i
nothing
already
and
i
cry
out
and
call
my
name
to
hear
if
it
still
lives
a
wheel
of
gold
turned
before
my
eyes
and
the
thunder
clapped
over
my
very
head
on
my
own
fjeld
instantly
i
started
out
of
the
sleeping
bag
and
left
my
shelter
the
thunder
rolled
on
there
was
lightning
and
more
thunder
worlds
were
uprooted
why
had
i
not
listened
to
olga
advice
and
remained
in
the
hut
is
it
the
lapps
whose
magic
powers
are
doing
this
the
lapps
those
human
mites
those
mountain
dwarfs
what
is
all
this
noise
to
me
i
made
a
feeble
effort
to
walk
against
it
but
stopped
again
for
i
was
among
giants
and
saw
the
foolishness
of
trying
to
battle
with
the
thunder
i
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
no
longer
did
i
stand
shouting
and
hurling
challenges
at
my
opponent
but
looked
at
him
with
eyes
and
now
that
i
have
yielded
none
but
a
mountain
would
be
so
hard
but
i
am
not
rhymes
and
rhythms
alone
did
you
think
i
should
waste
my
good
brain
chasing
such
rainbows
you
lie
here
i
lean
against
the
whole
world
and
you
perhaps
believe
the
blue
of
my
eyes
at
that
the
lightning
struck
me
this
was
a
miracle
and
it
happened
to
me
it
ran
down
my
left
elbow
scorching
the
sleeve
of
my
jacket
the
lightning
seemed
like
a
ball
of
wool
that
dropped
to
the
ground
i
felt
a
sensation
of
heat
and
saw
that
the
ground
farther
down
the
mountain
was
struck
a
loud
blow
and
then
split
a
great
oppression
held
me
down
a
spear
of
darkness
shot
through
me
and
then
it
thundered
beyond
all
measure
not
long
and
rumbling
but
firm
and
clear
and
rattling
the
storm
passed
on
vii
next
day
i
arrived
at
the
deserted
hut
drenched
to
the
skin
struck
by
lightning
but
in
a
strangely
gentle
and
yielding
mood
as
after
a
punishment
my
good
fortune
in
the
midst
of
my
made
me
overfriendly
to
everything
i
tramped
on
without
hurting
the
ground
and
i
avoided
sinful
thoughts
though
it
was
spring
i
was
not
even
out
of
temper
when
i
had
to
retrace
my
steps
across
the
fjeld
to
find
my
way
again
to
the
hut
i
had
time
there
was
no
hurry
i
was
the
first
tourist
of
the
spring
season
and
far
too
early
so
i
remained
at
my
ease
in
the
hut
for
a
few
days
sometimes
at
night
verses
and
small
poems
blossomed
in
my
mind
as
though
i
had
become
a
real
poet
at
any
rate
there
were
signs
that
great
changes
had
taken
place
within
me
since
the
winter
when
i
had
desired
nothing
but
to
lie
blinking
my
eyes
and
be
left
in
peace
one
day
when
everything
was
thawing
in
the
sun
i
left
the
hut
and
walked
about
the
mountains
for
some
hours
i
had
lately
been
thinking
of
writing
some
children
verses
addressed
to
a
certain
little
girl
but
nothing
had
come
of
it
now
as
i
walked
on
the
mountainside
i
felt
again
a
desire
for
this
pastime
and
worked
at
it
on
several
occasions
but
could
not
get
it
into
shape
the
night
when
one
has
slept
an
hour
or
two
is
the
time
when
such
things
come
to
one
so
i
went
straight
on
to
the
village
and
bought
myself
a
good
store
of
food
there
were
many
people
in
this
district
and
it
did
me
good
to
hear
human
speech
and
laughter
again
but
there
was
no
place
here
where
i
could
stay
and
in
any
case
i
had
come
too
early
i
had
much
to
carry
on
my
way
home
to
my
hut
again
about
halfway
i
met
a
man
a
casual
laborer
a
vagabond
whose
name
was
solem
later
i
heard
that
he
was
the
bastard
son
of
a
telegraph
operator
who
had
been
in
rosenlund
nearly
a
generation
before
that
this
man
should
have
stepped
off
the
path
to
let
me
pass
with
my
burden
was
a
good
trait
in
him
and
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
have
run
over
you
in
any
case
ha
ha
he
asked
me
if
there
was
much
snow
on
the
way
to
the
village
i
told
him
it
was
much
the
same
as
here
i
see
he
said
and
turned
away
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
come
a
long
way
and
since
he
carried
nothing
that
looked
like
provisions
i
offered
him
some
of
mine
in
order
to
make
him
talk
a
little
he
thanked
me
and
accepted
he
was
above
middle
height
and
quite
young
not
more
than
in
his
twenties
possibly
just
on
thirty
a
fine
fellow
after
the
swaggering
fashion
of
wanderers
he
had
a
lock
of
hair
escaping
from
under
the
peak
of
his
cap
but
he
wore
no
beard
this
man
still
shaved
without
growing
tired
of
doing
so
and
this
together
with
his
fringe
of
hair
and
his
general
manner
gave
me
the
impression
that
he
wished
to
seem
younger
than
he
was
we
talked
while
he
ate
he
laughed
readily
and
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
and
since
his
face
was
beardless
and
hard
it
looked
like
a
laughing
iron
mask
but
he
was
sensible
and
pleasant
there
was
only
one
thing
i
had
been
silent
for
so
long
that
i
talked
now
perhaps
too
readily
and
if
it
happened
that
both
this
boy
solem
and
i
spoke
at
once
he
would
stop
immediately
to
let
me
have
my
say
when
this
had
happened
several
times
i
grew
tired
of
winning
and
stopped
too
but
that
merely
made
him
nod
and
say
go
ahead
i
explained
to
him
that
i
idled
in
solitude
studying
strange
trees
and
writing
a
thing
or
two
about
them
that
i
lived
in
a
hut
but
that
today
i
had
finished
my
stock
of
provisions
and
had
had
to
go
to
the
village
when
he
heard
about
the
hut
he
stopped
chewing
and
sat
as
though
he
were
listening
then
he
said
hastily
yes
in
a
way
i
know
these
telegraph
poles
across
the
mountains
very
well
not
these
particular
poles
but
others
i
was
a
linesman
till
not
long
ago
were
you
i
said
have
you
passed
my
hut
today
i
added
he
hesitated
a
moment
but
when
he
saw
that
i
was
not
trying
to
put
him
in
the
wrong
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
in
the
hut
and
rested
and
found
my
there
it
was
easy
to
sit
there
without
taking
some
of
it
he
said
we
spoke
of
many
things
his
language
was
hardly
coarse
at
all
nor
did
he
dawdle
over
his
food
my
own
manners
had
run
wild
to
such
an
extent
that
i
valued
his
good
behavior
he
offered
to
help
me
carry
my
pack
as
a
mark
of
his
gratitude
for
the
food
and
i
accepted
his
offer
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
stranger
returned
to
the
hut
with
me
as
soon
as
i
came
in
i
saw
a
note
on
the
table
a
sort
of
thanks
for
the
bread
it
was
an
extremely
epistle
full
of
obscene
expressions
when
solem
saw
what
i
was
reading
his
iron
face
broke
into
a
smile
i
pretended
not
to
understand
the
note
and
threw
it
back
on
the
table
he
picked
it
up
and
tore
it
to
shreds
i
sorry
you
seen
it
he
said
we
linesmen
have
a
way
of
doing
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
forgotten
i
left
it
here
soon
after
this
he
went
out
he
stayed
that
night
and
next
day
and
found
a
means
of
repaying
me
by
washing
some
of
my
clothes
and
making
himself
useful
in
other
ways
there
was
a
large
tub
outside
the
hut
had
been
since
the
lapps
lived
there
which
was
cracked
and
leaked
abundantly
but
solem
stopped
the
cracks
with
bacon
fat
and
boiled
my
clothes
in
it
it
was
very
funny
to
watch
him
imperturbably
skimming
off
the
fat
that
floated
up
he
seemed
to
want
to
stay
till
we
had
finished
the
provisions
again
and
then
to
go
with
me
to
the
village
but
when
he
heard
i
was
going
the
other
way
to
the
mountain
farm
somewhere
under
the
great
peaks
of
the
tore
where
summer
visitors
stayed
and
many
travelers
passed
he
wanted
to
go
there
too
he
was
a
bird
of
passage
ca
i
come
with
you
and
help
you
carry
he
asked
me
i
used
to
farm
work
too
and
perhaps
i
can
get
a
job
there
viii
the
bustle
of
spring
season
had
already
started
at
the
great
farm
men
and
animals
were
awake
the
barn
with
lowing
the
whole
day
long
and
the
goats
had
long
since
been
let
out
to
pasture
it
was
a
long
way
between
neighbors
here
one
or
two
cotters
had
cleared
an
area
in
the
forest
which
they
had
then
bought
apart
from
that
all
the
land
in
sight
belonged
to
the
farm
many
new
houses
had
been
built
here
as
the
traffic
over
the
fjelds
increased
and
gargoyles
homelike
and
norwegian
sat
on
the
gable
ends
while
the
sound
of
a
piano
came
from
the
do
you
know
the
place
you
have
been
here
and
the
people
of
the
farm
have
asked
after
you
good
days
nothing
but
good
days
a
suitable
transition
from
solitude
i
speak
to
the
young
people
who
own
the
homestead
now
and
to
the
old
father
and
young
sister
josephine
the
old
man
leaves
his
room
to
look
at
me
he
is
terrifyingly
old
perhaps
ninety
his
eyes
are
worn
and
and
his
figure
has
shrunk
to
nothing
he
toils
with
both
hands
to
drag
himself
into
the
day
and
each
time
it
is
as
though
he
left
his
mother
womb
anew
and
found
a
world
before
him
look
how
strange
there
are
houses
on
the
farm
he
thinks
as
he
gazes
at
them
and
when
the
barn
doors
stand
open
he
looks
at
them
too
and
thinks
just
like
a
doorway
what
can
it
be
looks
exactly
like
a
doorway
and
he
stands
still
a
long
time
staring
at
it
but
josephine
the
daughter
of
his
latest
marriage
is
young
and
plays
the
piano
for
me
ah
josephine
as
she
runs
through
the
garden
her
feet
are
like
a
breeze
under
her
skirt
how
kind
she
is
to
the
visitors
surely
she
has
seen
us
coming
a
long
way
off
solem
and
myself
and
sat
down
to
play
the
piano
she
has
gray
pathetic
young
girl
hands
hands
which
confirm
an
old
observation
of
mine
that
one
hands
reveal
one
sexual
character
showing
chastity
indifference
or
passion
it
is
pleasant
to
watch
josephine
crouch
down
to
milk
the
goat
but
she
is
only
doing
this
now
to
charm
and
please
the
stranger
ordinarily
she
has
no
time
for
such
work
for
she
is
too
busy
at
her
indoor
tasks
waiting
at
table
and
watering
the
flowers
and
chatting
with
me
about
who
climbed
the
tore
peak
last
summer
and
who
did
it
the
summer
before
that
these
are
josephine
tasks
refreshed
and
rejuvenated
i
idle
about
stand
for
a
while
watching
solem
who
has
been
put
to
carting
manure
then
drift
on
down
through
the
wood
to
the
cotters
houses
neat
compact
houses
barns
with
room
for
two
cows
and
a
couple
of
goats
in
each
children
playing
homemade
games
outside
the
barns
quarrels
and
laughter
and
tears
the
men
at
both
places
cart
manure
on
sleighs
seeking
a
path
where
the
snow
and
ice
still
lie
on
the
ground
and
doing
very
well
with
it
i
do
not
descend
to
the
houses
but
watch
the
work
from
my
point
of
vantage
well
do
i
know
the
life
of
labor
and
well
do
i
like
it
it
was
no
small
area
these
cotters
had
broken
up
the
homesteads
were
tiny
but
the
fences
surrounding
the
land
included
a
good
section
of
forest
when
the
ground
was
cleared
all
the
way
to
the
fence
this
would
be
a
farm
with
five
cows
and
a
horse
good
luck
the
days
pass
the
windowpanes
have
thawed
the
snow
is
melting
away
green
things
grow
against
south
walls
and
the
leaves
break
out
in
the
woods
my
original
intention
to
make
great
irons
hot
within
me
is
unchanged
but
if
i
ever
thought
this
an
easy
task
i
must
be
an
incredible
fool
i
do
not
even
know
with
any
certainty
if
there
are
irons
in
me
still
or
whether
i
can
shape
them
if
there
are
since
the
winter
life
has
made
me
lonely
and
small
i
idle
and
loiter
here
remembering
that
once
things
were
different
now
that
i
have
reached
daylight
and
men
again
i
begin
to
understand
all
this
i
was
a
different
person
once
the
wave
has
its
feathered
crest
and
so
had
i
wine
has
its
fire
and
so
had
neurasthenia
the
ape
of
all
the
diseases
pursues
me
what
then
no
i
do
not
mourn
this
mourn
it
is
for
women
to
mourn
life
is
only
a
loan
and
i
am
grateful
for
the
loan
at
times
i
have
had
gold
and
silver
and
copper
and
iron
and
other
small
metals
it
was
a
great
delight
to
live
in
the
world
much
greater
than
an
endless
life
away
from
the
world
but
pleasure
can
not
last
i
know
of
no
one
who
has
not
been
through
the
same
thing
but
i
know
of
no
one
who
will
admit
it
how
they
have
declined
but
they
themselves
have
said
see
how
everything
is
better
at
their
first
jubilee
they
left
life
behind
and
began
a
vegetating
existence
once
one
is
fifty
the
seventies
begin
and
the
irons
were
no
longer
there
were
no
irons
but
by
heaven
how
stubbornly
simplicity
insisted
the
irons
were
there
insisted
that
they
were
red
see
the
irons
simplicity
said
see
how
red
they
are
as
though
it
mattered
that
death
can
be
kept
off
for
another
twenty
years
from
one
who
has
already
begun
to
perish
i
have
no
use
for
such
a
way
of
thinking
but
you
have
no
doubt
you
with
your
cheerful
mediocrity
and
school
education
a
man
can
still
walk
a
man
can
lie
down
has
the
forest
taught
you
nothing
then
what
have
i
learned
in
the
forest
young
trees
grow
in
my
footsteps
walks
youth
youth
that
is
shamelessly
barbarously
scorned
merely
because
it
is
young
scorned
by
stupidity
and
degeneration
i
have
seen
this
for
many
years
i
know
nothing
more
despicable
than
your
school
education
and
your
standards
whether
you
have
a
catechism
or
a
compass
by
which
to
guide
your
life
is
all
the
same
come
here
my
friend
and
i
will
give
you
a
compass
made
of
my
latest
iron
ix
a
tourist
arrived
at
the
farm
the
first
tourist
and
the
master
of
the
house
himself
went
with
him
across
the
fjeld
and
as
for
solem
why
he
too
went
with
him
so
that
he
might
know
the
way
for
later
tourists
we
found
the
fat
short
and
stranger
standing
in
the
yard
an
elderly
man
who
walked
for
the
sake
of
his
health
and
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
josephine
the
dear
girl
made
her
feet
a
breeze
beneath
her
skirts
and
got
him
into
the
living
room
with
its
piano
and
its
earthenware
bowls
with
beaded
edges
when
he
was
leaving
he
brought
out
his
small
change
which
josephine
received
in
her
gray
fingers
on
the
other
side
of
the
fjeld
solem
was
given
two
crowns
for
acting
as
guide
and
that
was
good
pay
all
went
so
well
that
the
master
himself
was
content
now
they
be
coming
he
said
if
only
they
would
leave
us
in
peace
he
added
by
this
he
meant
he
regretted
the
good
carefree
days
that
he
and
his
household
had
enjoyed
till
now
but
in
a
few
weeks
a
motor
road
would
be
opened
in
the
neighboring
valley
and
then
it
was
a
question
whether
the
tourist
traffic
might
not
be
deflected
there
his
wife
and
josephine
were
a
little
afraid
it
would
be
but
he
himself
had
held
as
long
as
possible
to
the
opinion
that
all
their
regular
visitors
who
had
come
again
year
after
year
would
remain
faithful
no
matter
how
many
roads
and
motor
cars
they
might
have
in
other
places
they
could
not
get
the
peaks
of
the
tore
range
anywhere
but
here
the
master
of
the
house
had
felt
so
confident
that
once
more
he
had
much
timber
lying
by
the
wall
of
the
barn
ready
to
be
built
into
new
cottages
with
six
new
guestrooms
a
great
hall
with
reindeer
horns
and
log
chairs
and
a
bathroom
but
what
was
the
matter
with
him
today
was
he
beginning
to
doubt
if
only
they
would
leave
us
in
peace
he
said
a
week
later
brede
arrived
with
her
children
she
had
a
cottage
to
herself
as
in
previous
summers
so
she
must
be
rich
and
fashionable
this
brede
since
she
had
a
cottage
to
herself
she
was
a
charming
lady
and
her
little
daughters
were
handsome
children
they
curtsied
to
me
making
me
feel
i
do
know
why
as
though
they
were
giving
me
flowers
a
strange
feeling
then
came
miss
torsen
and
molie
who
were
both
to
stay
for
the
summer
they
were
followed
by
schoolmaster
staur
who
would
stay
a
week
later
came
two
schoolmistresses
the
misses
johnsen
and
palm
and
still
later
associate
schoolmaster
höy
and
several
others
tradesmen
telephone
operators
a
few
people
from
bergen
one
or
two
danes
there
were
many
of
us
at
table
now
and
the
talk
was
lively
when
schoolmaster
staur
was
asked
if
he
wanted
more
soup
he
replied
no
thank
you
i
require
no
more
and
then
rolled
his
eyes
at
us
to
show
that
this
was
the
correct
thing
to
say
between
meals
we
made
up
small
parties
going
this
way
and
that
on
the
sides
of
the
fjeld
and
in
the
woods
but
of
transient
guests
there
were
few
or
none
at
all
and
it
was
really
on
these
that
the
house
would
earn
well
on
rooms
for
a
night
on
single
meals
on
cups
of
coffee
josephine
seemed
to
be
worrying
lately
and
her
young
fingers
grew
more
greedy
as
they
counted
silver
coins
lean
brook
trout
stew
and
tinned
foods
some
of
the
guests
were
dissatisfied
people
who
spoke
of
leaving
others
praised
both
the
food
and
the
wild
mountain
scenery
schoolmistress
torsen
wanted
to
leave
she
was
tall
and
handsome
and
wore
a
red
hat
on
her
dark
hair
but
there
were
no
suitable
young
men
here
and
in
the
long
run
it
was
a
bore
to
waste
her
holidays
so
completely
tradesman
batt
who
had
been
in
both
africa
and
america
was
the
only
possibility
for
even
the
bergensians
amounted
to
nothing
where
miss
torsen
batt
would
ask
us
here
i
am
i
coming
the
lady
answered
they
did
not
care
for
walks
up
the
fjeld
but
preferred
to
go
to
the
woods
together
where
they
talked
for
hours
but
tradesman
batt
did
not
amount
to
much
either
he
was
short
and
freckled
and
talked
of
nothing
but
money
and
trade
besides
he
had
only
a
small
shop
in
the
town
and
dealt
in
tobacco
and
fruit
no
he
did
not
amount
to
much
one
day
during
a
long
spell
of
rain
i
sat
talking
with
miss
torsen
she
was
an
extraordinary
girl
ordinarily
proud
and
reserved
but
sometimes
talkative
lively
and
perhaps
a
little
inconsiderate
too
we
sat
in
the
living
room
with
people
coming
and
going
continually
but
she
did
not
let
that
disturb
her
and
talked
in
high
clear
tones
in
her
eagerness
she
sometimes
clasped
her
hands
and
then
dragged
them
apart
again
after
we
had
been
sitting
there
for
some
time
tradesman
batt
came
in
listened
to
her
for
a
moment
and
then
said
i
going
out
now
miss
torsen
are
you
coming
she
swept
him
once
with
her
eyes
from
head
to
foot
then
she
turned
away
and
went
on
talking
looking
very
proud
and
determined
as
she
did
so
no
doubt
she
had
many
good
qualities
she
was
she
said
and
sick
and
tired
of
a
teacher
life
but
why
had
she
ever
entered
on
such
a
life
in
the
first
place
oh
just
doing
what
everybody
else
did
she
replied
the
girls
next
door
were
also
going
to
walk
the
road
of
scholarship
to
study
languages
as
they
called
it
study
grammar
it
all
sounded
so
fine
we
were
going
to
be
independent
and
earn
a
lot
of
money
that
what
i
thought
have
a
home
however
small
that
was
quite
my
own
how
we
slogged
away
all
through
school
some
of
the
girls
had
money
but
those
of
us
who
were
poor
could
dress
like
them
and
we
had
hands
like
theirs
and
so
we
came
to
avoid
all
work
at
home
for
the
sake
of
our
hands
and
we
played
up
to
the
boys
at
school
too
we
thought
them
such
fine
gentlemen
one
of
them
had
a
riding
horse
bit
of
a
fool
of
course
but
he
was
a
millionaire
son
and
awfully
decent
gave
us
banknotes
me
anyhow
and
he
kissed
me
many
times
his
name
was
flaten
his
father
was
a
merchant
of
course
he
being
so
handsome
and
dashing
we
wanted
to
be
nice
to
him
too
i
should
have
done
anything
he
asked
i
used
to
pray
to
god
for
him
i
sure
i
was
the
only
one
who
wanted
to
be
smart
and
pretty
that
was
how
we
passed
the
time
washing
and
cooking
and
mending
fell
to
the
lot
of
my
mother
and
sisters
we
students
would
do
anything
but
sit
round
being
very
learned
and
getting
seraphic
hands
we
were
quite
mad
as
i
do
mind
admitting
it
was
in
the
course
of
those
years
that
we
acquired
all
the
distorted
ideas
we
been
burdened
with
since
we
grew
dull
with
school
wisdom
anaemic
unbalanced
sometimes
terribly
unhappy
about
our
sad
lot
sometimes
hysterically
happy
and
pluming
ourselves
on
our
examinations
and
our
importance
we
were
the
pride
of
the
family
and
of
course
we
were
independent
we
got
jobs
in
offices
at
forty
a
month
because
now
there
was
no
longer
anything
in
the
least
extraordinary
about
us
students
we
were
no
rarity
there
were
hundreds
of
us
forty
was
the
most
they
gave
us
thirty
went
to
father
and
mother
for
our
keep
and
ten
for
ourselves
it
enough
we
had
to
have
pretty
clothes
for
the
office
and
we
were
young
we
liked
to
walk
out
but
everything
was
too
dear
for
us
we
went
into
debt
and
some
of
us
got
engaged
to
poor
devils
like
ourselves
the
narrow
school
life
during
our
years
of
development
did
more
than
hurt
our
intelligence
we
wanted
to
show
spirit
too
and
not
recoil
before
any
experience
so
some
of
us
went
to
the
bad
others
married
and
with
such
antecedents
of
course
there
was
mismanagement
in
the
home
others
disappeared
to
america
but
probably
all
of
them
are
still
boasting
their
languages
and
their
examinations
it
all
they
have
left
not
happiness
or
health
or
innocence
but
their
matriculation
good
god
but
surely
some
of
you
have
become
schoolmistresses
with
good
salaries
good
salaries
anyhow
first
we
had
to
start
studying
all
over
again
as
though
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
had
sacrificed
enough
for
our
sakes
already
there
was
cramming
again
for
long
periods
and
then
we
began
life
in
the
schoolroom
to
give
to
others
the
same
unnatural
upbringing
we
had
had
ourselves
oh
yes
ours
was
a
noble
vocation
it
was
almost
like
being
missionaries
but
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
like
to
talk
about
something
besides
this
exalted
position
anything
else
you
please
tradesman
batt
opened
the
door
and
said
are
you
coming
miss
torsen
it
stopped
raining
now
oh
leave
me
alone
she
replied
tradesman
batt
withdrew
why
do
you
turn
him
away
like
that
i
asked
because
well
the
weather
is
bad
she
said
looking
out
of
the
window
besides
he
such
a
fool
and
he
takes
such
liberties
how
sure
of
herself
she
looked
and
how
right
she
seemed
poor
miss
torsen
true
or
not
the
news
gradually
spread
that
miss
torsen
had
recently
lost
her
post
at
the
school
where
indulgence
had
been
exercised
for
a
long
time
toward
her
eccentric
methods
of
teaching
so
that
was
it
but
certainly
what
she
had
told
me
was
nonetheless
true
x
the
news
has
leaked
out
that
the
master
of
the
homestead
here
owes
a
huge
debt
and
that
because
he
needs
cash
he
has
sold
new
valuable
plots
of
land
to
his
cotters
i
am
finding
out
many
things
now
brede
with
the
handsome
head
knows
something
about
everything
for
her
many
summers
at
the
farm
have
given
her
knowledge
when
she
talks
about
conditions
here
she
need
not
grope
for
words
the
master
has
taken
a
large
mortgage
no
one
would
believe
that
all
is
not
well
here
the
many
new
buildings
and
flagpoles
the
curtains
at
the
windows
and
the
well
house
all
give
an
impression
of
great
prosperity
the
rooms
too
make
a
good
impression
i
shall
not
speak
of
the
piano
but
here
are
pictures
on
the
walls
and
photographs
of
the
farm
seen
from
all
angles
good
newspapers
are
kept
and
there
is
a
selection
of
novels
on
the
tables
though
guests
sometimes
take
books
away
with
them
the
books
are
never
missed
or
take
a
thing
like
this
you
get
your
bill
on
a
handsomely
printed
paper
with
a
picture
at
the
top
of
the
farm
and
the
tore
range
in
the
background
in
short
no
one
would
doubt
for
a
moment
that
there
is
a
fortune
here
and
why
not
after
twenty
years
as
a
kind
of
resort
for
tourists
and
pensioners
nevertheless
the
truth
is
that
this
homestead
with
all
its
interior
and
exterior
furnishings
costs
more
than
the
business
is
worth
manufacturer
brede
too
has
put
money
into
it
and
that
is
why
brede
comes
here
every
year
with
her
children
to
get
their
dividends
in
board
and
lodging
no
wonder
she
has
a
house
to
herself
after
all
it
her
own
house
it
was
a
good
place
in
the
old
days
says
brede
travelers
stopped
here
and
had
a
meal
and
a
bed
for
the
night
it
cost
nothing
to
run
the
place
then
but
the
tourist
traffic
has
forced
him
to
make
improvements
and
enlargements
you
have
to
keep
pace
with
development
and
be
as
good
as
other
such
places
in
the
country
they
all
competing
and
probably
the
master
here
is
not
the
right
man
to
carry
on
such
an
irregular
and
capricious
business
he
has
learned
to
like
idleness
too
much
and
lets
the
farm
take
care
of
itself
but
the
two
cotters
are
fellows
they
nephews
of
his
and
bit
by
bit
they
buying
the
farm
from
him
and
cultivating
it
my
husband
often
says
it
will
end
with
the
cotters
or
their
children
buying
this
whole
place
of
his
paul
how
can
the
cotters
get
power
to
do
that
they
work
hard
they
peasants
they
started
in
the
forest
with
three
or
four
goats
each
first
one
of
them
then
the
other
one
working
down
in
the
village
and
coming
home
with
food
and
money
and
all
the
time
clearing
their
own
ground
the
goats
grew
more
numerous
a
cow
was
added
they
bought
more
virgin
land
and
they
acquired
still
more
livestock
they
sowed
grain
and
planted
potatoes
and
cultivated
pasture
land
the
owner
here
buys
root
vegetables
from
his
cotters
he
has
time
to
toil
with
such
things
himself
there
a
great
deal
of
work
in
it
oh
no
they
do
sow
anything
but
green
fodder
for
the
stock
here
paul
says
it
not
and
in
a
way
he
right
he
tried
hiring
enough
men
to
run
the
farm
too
but
it
wo
work
it
just
in
the
spring
season
that
the
tourists
start
coming
and
then
the
men
are
constantly
being
interrupted
in
their
work
on
the
farm
to
pilot
tourists
across
the
fjeld
or
to
do
this
or
that
for
the
guests
and
this
goes
on
all
through
the
short
summer
months
for
several
years
they
have
even
found
the
time
to
spread
all
their
manure
but
the
worst
time
is
really
the
autumn
when
the
tourists
are
all
rushing
to
get
home
again
and
it
quite
impossible
to
do
the
harvesting
undisturbed
it
almost
become
a
custom
here
now
my
husband
says
for
the
cotters
to
get
half
the
harvest
of
the
farm
outlying
fields
on
my
wondering
at
brede
knowledge
of
farming
she
told
me
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
she
herself
knew
very
little
about
it
and
had
all
her
information
from
her
husband
the
fact
was
that
every
time
these
cotters
wanted
to
buy
a
fresh
piece
of
land
from
paul
her
husband
had
to
give
his
consent
this
was
because
of
the
mortgage
and
this
too
was
how
they
had
learned
of
these
matters
manufacturer
brede
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
most
anxious
to
be
released
from
his
undertaking
but
this
was
by
no
means
easy
it
was
with
great
apprehensions
that
he
now
regarded
the
new
automobile
route
brede
was
full
of
a
maternal
gentleness
she
played
with
her
little
girls
and
seemed
to
enjoy
an
admirable
balance
of
mind
one
day
for
example
a
goat
came
home
with
one
of
its
hind
legs
broken
and
all
the
guests
hurried
out
with
brandy
and
lanolin
and
bandages
for
the
wound
but
brede
remained
quietly
where
she
was
experienced
wise
and
a
little
surprised
at
all
the
excitement
all
you
can
do
with
such
a
goat
she
said
is
to
slaughter
it
the
lady
i
understood
must
have
married
early
for
her
two
little
girls
were
twelve
and
ten
her
husband
seemed
to
deal
in
important
business
for
he
spent
a
large
part
of
the
year
in
iceland
and
traveled
a
good
deal
elsewhere
as
well
this
too
the
lady
bore
quietly
and
yet
she
was
still
young
and
handsome
a
little
plump
perhaps
for
her
height
but
with
a
lovely
unwrinkled
skin
she
was
quite
unlike
miss
torsen
the
only
other
lady
at
the
farm
miss
torsen
was
tall
and
dark
but
perhaps
brede
was
not
always
so
calm
as
she
seemed
one
evening
when
she
went
down
to
the
men
hut
and
asked
solem
to
do
her
a
service
i
saw
that
her
face
was
strange
and
covered
with
blushes
would
solem
come
to
her
room
and
repair
a
that
had
fallen
down
it
was
late
in
the
evening
and
the
lady
seemed
to
have
been
in
bed
already
and
to
have
risen
again
solem
did
not
appear
very
willing
suddenly
their
eyes
met
and
clung
for
a
moment
yes
certainly
of
course
he
would
come
what
an
iron
face
he
had
and
what
a
rogue
he
was
brede
departed
but
a
moment
later
she
returned
to
say
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
never
mind
thank
you
she
would
fix
the
blind
in
position
herself
xi
an
occasional
tourist
came
or
went
solem
accompanied
him
across
the
fjeld
and
he
was
gone
but
where
were
all
the
foreigners
this
year
bennett
and
cook
conducted
tours
the
hordes
that
would
do
the
mountain
peaks
of
norway
where
were
they
at
last
two
solitary
englishmen
turned
up
they
were
unshaven
and
altogether
two
engineers
or
something
of
that
sort
but
quite
as
speechless
and
uncivil
as
the
grandest
of
the
traveling
british
clowns
guide
guide
they
called
you
the
guide
nothing
about
them
was
any
different
from
what
we
had
grown
to
expect
these
two
traveled
brainlessly
and
solemnly
to
the
mountain
tops
were
in
a
hurry
had
a
purpose
behaved
as
though
they
were
running
to
catch
a
doctor
solem
went
with
them
to
the
top
and
down
the
other
side
and
they
offered
him
a
bit
solem
held
out
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
told
me
afterwards
for
he
thought
they
would
put
more
in
it
but
nothing
came
of
that
so
he
created
a
disturbance
solem
has
grown
spoiled
and
insolent
from
all
his
idling
with
tourists
mehr
more
said
he
no
they
would
not
solem
flung
the
coin
on
the
ground
and
struck
his
hands
together
repeatedly
this
had
the
required
effect
and
one
made
its
appearance
but
on
solem
taking
the
noble
lord
by
the
shoulder
and
exerting
a
little
pressure
two
were
at
last
forthcoming
at
length
a
conducted
party
arrived
many
tongues
both
sexes
huntsmen
fishermen
dogs
mountaineers
porters
there
was
a
tremendous
commotion
at
the
farm
the
flag
was
run
up
paul
bent
double
under
all
the
orders
he
received
and
josephine
ran
flew
at
every
call
brede
had
to
give
up
her
sitting
room
to
three
english
ladies
and
the
rest
of
us
were
crowded
together
as
close
as
possible
i
for
my
part
was
to
be
allowed
to
keep
my
bed
because
of
my
settled
age
but
i
said
by
no
means
let
this
english
solicitor
or
whatever
he
is
have
my
bed
what
does
it
matter
for
a
night
then
i
went
out
if
one
keeps
one
eyes
open
one
may
see
a
great
deal
at
such
a
resort
in
the
daytime
and
one
may
see
much
at
night
too
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
bleating
of
goats
in
the
shed
why
are
the
animals
not
at
rest
the
door
is
closed
none
of
the
visiting
dogs
has
got
in
or
some
of
the
visiting
dogs
got
in
vice
like
virtue
walks
in
rings
and
circles
nothing
is
new
all
returns
to
its
beginnings
and
repeats
itself
the
romans
ruled
the
world
yes
they
were
so
mighty
the
romans
so
invincible
that
they
could
permit
themselves
a
vice
or
two
they
could
afford
to
live
at
the
arena
they
had
their
fun
with
young
boys
and
animals
then
one
day
retribution
overtook
them
their
children
children
lost
battles
everywhere
and
their
children
children
again
only
sat
sat
and
looked
backward
the
ring
was
closed
none
were
less
rulers
of
the
world
than
the
romans
they
paid
no
attention
to
me
the
two
englishmen
in
the
goats
shed
i
was
merely
one
of
the
natives
a
norwegian
who
had
but
to
accept
the
ways
of
the
mighty
tourists
but
they
themselves
belonged
to
that
nation
of
gamblers
coachmen
and
vice
which
one
day
the
wholesome
gothic
soul
will
castigate
to
death
the
disturbance
continued
all
night
and
very
early
the
dogs
began
to
bark
the
caravan
awoke
it
was
six
in
the
morning
and
doors
began
to
bang
in
all
the
houses
they
were
in
a
great
hurry
these
travelers
they
were
running
to
catch
the
doctor
they
had
breakfast
in
two
sessions
but
though
the
household
was
bent
double
before
them
and
gave
of
its
best
they
were
not
satisfied
if
we
had
only
known
a
little
earlier
said
paul
but
they
muttered
that
we
should
just
wait
there
were
motor
cars
in
other
places
then
paul
spoke
paul
the
master
of
the
farm
the
man
who
lived
under
the
tore
peaks
but
i
going
to
enlarge
do
you
see
all
the
timber
outside
and
planning
to
get
a
telephone
the
caravan
paid
the
exact
amount
of
their
small
bill
and
departed
accompanied
by
the
master
and
solem
both
carrying
trunks
peace
descended
on
us
again
schoolmaster
staur
left
now
too
he
had
been
busy
collecting
plants
round
the
tore
peaks
and
talked
about
his
plants
at
table
in
a
very
learned
fashion
giving
the
latin
names
and
pointing
out
their
peculiarities
yes
indeed
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
at
school
here
you
see
an
he
said
miss
torsen
who
had
also
imbibed
much
learning
recognized
the
name
and
said
yes
take
plenty
of
it
with
you
what
for
it
insect
powder
schoolmaster
staur
knew
nothing
of
that
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
in
which
associate
master
höy
had
to
take
a
hand
no
schoolmaster
staur
knew
nothing
of
that
but
he
could
classify
plants
and
learn
their
names
by
heart
he
enjoyed
that
the
peasant
children
in
his
neighborhood
were
ignorant
of
these
classes
and
names
and
he
could
teach
them
he
enjoyed
that
so
much
but
was
the
spirit
of
the
soil
his
friend
the
plant
that
is
cut
down
one
year
yet
grows
again
the
next
did
this
miracle
make
him
religious
and
silent
the
stones
and
the
heather
and
the
branches
of
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
woods
and
the
wind
and
the
great
heaven
of
all
the
universe
were
these
his
friends
xii
when
i
get
tired
of
associate
master
höy
and
the
ladies
sometimes
i
think
of
molie
she
sits
sewing
while
the
associate
master
gravely
keeps
her
company
they
talk
about
the
servants
at
home
whose
only
desire
is
to
stay
out
all
night
molie
is
a
thin
lady
but
probably
she
has
at
one
time
been
less
plain
her
bluish
teeth
look
as
though
they
were
cold
as
though
they
were
made
of
ice
but
perhaps
a
few
years
ago
her
full
lips
and
the
dark
down
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
seemed
to
her
husband
the
most
beautiful
thing
he
knew
her
husband
well
he
was
a
seafaring
man
a
ship
captain
he
only
came
home
on
rare
occasions
just
often
enough
to
increase
the
family
usually
he
was
in
australia
china
or
mexico
it
was
hail
and
farewell
with
him
and
here
is
his
wife
now
for
the
sake
of
her
health
i
wonder
is
it
only
for
her
health
or
are
she
and
the
associate
master
possibly
children
of
the
same
provincial
town
when
i
get
tired
of
associate
master
höy
and
the
ladies
i
leave
them
and
go
out
and
then
i
stay
out
all
day
long
and
nobody
knows
where
i
keep
myself
it
is
fitting
that
a
settled
man
should
be
different
from
the
associate
master
who
is
very
far
from
being
so
settled
so
i
go
out
it
is
a
bright
day
with
just
the
right
amount
of
warmth
and
my
summer
woods
are
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
plants
i
rest
frequently
not
because
i
need
to
but
because
the
ground
is
full
of
caresses
i
go
so
far
that
no
one
can
find
me
only
then
am
i
released
no
sound
reaches
me
from
farms
or
men
no
one
is
in
sight
only
this
overgrown
little
goat
track
which
is
green
at
the
edges
and
lovely
only
a
bit
of
a
goat
track
which
looks
as
though
it
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
woods
lying
there
so
thin
and
lonely
you
who
read
this
feel
nothing
but
i
who
sit
here
writing
feel
a
kind
of
sweetness
at
the
memory
of
a
mere
track
in
the
woods
it
was
like
meeting
a
child
with
my
hands
under
my
neck
and
my
nose
in
the
air
my
eyes
flit
across
the
sky
high
up
above
the
peaks
of
tore
a
clustering
mist
sways
in
slow
rhythm
breaks
apart
and
presses
close
again
fluctuates
and
strains
to
give
birth
to
something
but
when
i
rise
to
walk
on
the
end
is
not
yet
in
sight
i
meet
a
line
of
ants
a
procession
of
ants
busy
travelers
they
neither
toil
nor
carry
anything
they
simply
move
i
retrace
my
steps
to
see
if
i
can
find
their
leader
but
it
is
useless
farther
and
farther
i
retreat
i
begin
to
run
but
the
procession
is
endless
before
and
behind
me
perhaps
they
started
a
week
ago
so
i
go
on
my
way
and
the
other
insects
go
on
theirs
surely
this
is
not
a
mountainside
i
walk
on
this
is
a
bosom
an
embrace
in
its
softness
i
tread
gently
for
i
do
not
wish
to
stamp
or
weigh
it
down
and
i
marvel
a
mountain
so
tender
and
defenseless
indulgent
like
a
mother
to
think
of
an
ant
walking
on
this
here
and
there
lie
stones
with
moss
not
because
they
have
fallen
there
but
because
this
is
their
home
and
they
have
lived
here
long
this
is
peerless
when
i
reach
the
top
and
look
back
it
is
high
noon
far
away
on
another
peak
walks
one
of
the
cows
of
the
cotters
a
strange
little
cow
with
red
and
white
flanks
a
crow
sits
on
a
high
cliff
above
me
and
caws
down
at
me
in
a
voice
like
an
iron
rasp
scraping
against
the
stone
a
warm
thrill
runs
through
me
and
i
feel
as
i
have
done
in
the
woods
so
many
times
before
that
someone
has
just
been
here
and
has
stepped
to
one
side
someone
is
with
me
here
and
a
moment
later
i
see
his
back
disappearing
into
the
woods
it
is
god
i
think
there
i
stand
neither
speaking
nor
singing
i
only
see
i
feel
all
my
face
being
filled
with
the
sight
it
was
god
i
think
a
vision
you
say
no
a
little
insight
into
things
i
reply
am
i
making
a
god
of
nature
do
not
you
have
not
the
mohammedans
their
god
the
jews
theirs
the
hindus
theirs
no
one
knows
god
my
friend
man
knows
only
gods
and
sometimes
i
meet
mine
i
go
home
by
a
different
route
which
forms
a
vast
arc
with
the
one
i
came
by
the
sun
is
warmer
now
and
the
ground
less
smooth
i
reach
a
great
ruin
the
remnant
of
a
landslide
and
here
to
amuse
myself
i
pretend
to
be
tired
flinging
myself
on
the
ground
exactly
as
though
someone
were
watching
me
and
saw
how
exhausted
i
am
it
is
only
for
my
amusement
because
my
brain
has
been
idle
so
long
the
sky
is
clear
everywhere
the
clusters
of
mist
over
the
tore
peaks
are
gone
heaven
knows
where
but
they
have
stolen
away
in
their
place
an
eagle
swings
in
great
circles
over
the
valley
huge
black
and
inaccessible
he
traces
ring
after
ring
as
though
held
on
a
rail
in
the
air
moving
with
voluptuous
languor
a
male
a
winged
stallion
exulting
it
is
like
music
to
watch
him
at
length
he
disappears
behind
the
peaks
and
here
are
only
myself
and
the
ruin
and
the
little
juniper
trees
what
miracles
all
things
are
these
stones
in
the
ruin
perhaps
hold
some
meaning
they
have
lain
here
for
thousands
of
years
but
perhaps
they
too
roam
and
make
an
inexpressible
journey
the
glaciers
move
the
land
rises
and
the
land
falls
there
is
no
hurry
here
but
since
my
consciousness
can
not
associate
fact
with
such
a
conception
it
grows
blind
with
fury
and
revolts
the
ruin
can
not
move
these
are
mere
words
a
game
this
ruin
is
a
town
here
and
there
lie
scattered
buildings
of
stone
a
peaceable
gathering
without
sensations
or
suicides
and
perhaps
a
soul
sits
in
each
of
these
stones
but
heaven
protect
me
just
the
same
from
the
inhabitants
of
these
towns
rolling
stones
can
not
bark
neither
do
they
attract
thieves
they
are
mere
ballast
quiet
behavior
that
is
what
i
hold
against
them
that
they
make
no
fiery
gestures
it
would
become
them
to
roll
a
little
but
there
they
lie
with
even
their
sex
unknown
but
you
saw
the
eagle
instead
be
still
a
gentle
wind
begins
to
blow
swaying
the
bracken
a
little
the
flowers
and
the
straw
but
the
straw
can
not
sway
it
only
trembles
i
walk
on
along
my
great
arc
and
come
down
by
the
first
cotter
house
well
i
expect
you
end
up
by
building
a
summer
resort
too
i
tell
him
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
oh
no
we
could
venture
on
anything
like
that
he
replies
cunningly
in
his
heart
i
daresay
he
has
no
desire
to
for
he
has
seen
what
it
leads
to
i
did
like
him
his
eyes
were
fawning
and
rested
on
the
ground
he
thought
of
nothing
but
land
he
was
like
an
animal
that
sought
to
escape
its
padlock
the
other
cotter
had
bought
a
slightly
larger
piece
of
land
than
he
a
marsh
that
would
feed
one
cow
more
but
he
himself
had
only
got
this
bit
of
a
field
still
this
would
amount
to
something
too
as
long
as
he
kept
his
health
to
work
it
he
gripped
his
spade
again
xiii
solem
was
being
discussed
at
dinner
i
do
know
who
began
it
but
some
of
the
ladies
thought
he
was
and
they
nodded
and
said
yes
he
was
the
right
sort
what
do
you
mean
by
the
right
sort
associate
master
höy
asked
looking
up
from
his
plate
no
one
answered
then
associate
master
höy
could
not
help
smiling
broadly
and
said
well
well
i
must
have
a
look
at
this
solem
some
time
i
never
paid
any
attention
to
him
associate
master
höy
might
look
at
solem
all
he
pleased
he
would
grow
no
bigger
for
that
nor
solem
smaller
the
good
höy
was
annoyed
and
that
was
the
truth
it
is
catching
for
a
woman
to
discover
that
a
man
is
the
right
sort
the
other
women
grow
curious
and
stick
their
noses
into
it
is
he
and
a
few
days
later
the
whole
flock
of
them
are
of
one
opinion
yes
indeed
he
the
right
sort
pity
the
poor
associate
masters
then
poor
höy
there
was
molie
too
nodding
her
head
for
solem
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
no
appearance
of
knowing
much
about
the
matter
but
she
could
not
lag
behind
the
others
so
molie
is
nodding
too
said
höy
and
smiled
again
he
was
intensely
annoyed
molie
turned
pink
and
pretty
at
the
next
meal
höy
could
contain
himself
no
longer
ladies
he
said
mine
eyes
have
now
beheld
master
solem
well
common
oh
shame
you
must
admit
he
has
a
brazen
look
on
his
face
no
beard
blue
chin
a
perfect
there
no
harm
in
that
said
molie
molie
does
seem
to
have
gone
quite
out
of
circulation
after
all
i
thought
in
fact
she
had
lately
been
developing
quite
a
little
cushion
over
her
chest
and
no
longer
looked
so
hunched
up
she
had
eaten
well
and
slept
well
and
improved
at
this
resort
molie
i
suspect
still
has
plenty
of
life
left
in
her
this
proved
true
a
few
days
later
once
again
poor
associate
master
höy
for
now
we
had
a
new
visitor
at
the
farm
a
gay
dog
of
a
lawyer
and
he
talked
more
to
molie
than
to
anyone
else
had
there
been
anything
between
her
and
höy
true
he
was
not
much
to
look
at
but
then
neither
was
she
the
young
lawyer
was
a
sportsman
yet
he
was
learned
in
the
social
sciences
too
had
been
in
switzerland
and
studied
the
principle
of
the
referendum
at
first
he
had
worked
a
few
years
in
an
architect
office
he
told
us
but
then
he
had
changed
to
the
law
instead
which
in
its
turn
had
led
him
into
social
problems
no
doubt
he
was
a
rich
and
unselfish
man
to
be
able
to
change
his
vocation
and
to
travel
in
this
way
ah
switzerland
he
said
and
his
eyes
watered
none
of
us
could
understand
his
fervor
yes
it
must
be
a
wonderful
country
molie
said
the
associate
master
looked
ready
to
burst
and
was
quite
incapable
of
restraining
himself
speaking
of
solem
he
said
suddenly
i
changed
my
mind
about
him
lately
he
ten
times
better
than
many
another
there
you
see
yes
he
is
and
he
does
pretend
to
be
anything
more
than
he
is
and
what
he
is
is
of
some
use
i
saw
him
slaughter
the
lame
goat
did
you
stop
to
watch
that
i
happened
to
be
passing
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
for
him
and
later
i
saw
him
in
the
woodshed
he
knows
his
job
that
fellow
i
can
well
understand
that
the
ladies
see
something
in
him
how
the
associate
master
clowned
he
finished
by
imploring
the
wife
of
the
captain
who
was
sailing
the
china
seas
to
be
sure
and
remain
faithful
to
her
chinaman
do
be
quiet
and
let
the
lawyer
tell
us
about
switzerland
said
molie
witch
did
she
want
to
drive
her
the
associate
master
into
jumping
off
the
highest
peak
of
the
tore
tonight
but
then
brede
took
a
hand
she
understood
höy
torment
and
wanted
to
help
him
had
not
this
same
höy
just
expressed
himself
kindly
about
solem
and
was
not
solem
the
lad
who
one
fine
evening
had
caused
her
to
tear
down
her
window
blind
there
is
cause
and
effect
in
all
things
switzerland
said
brede
in
her
gentle
fashion
and
then
she
reddened
and
laughed
a
little
i
do
know
anything
about
switzerland
but
once
i
bought
some
dress
material
that
was
swiss
and
i
never
in
my
life
been
so
cheated
the
lawyer
only
smiled
at
this
schoolmistress
johnsen
talked
about
what
she
had
learned
watchmakers
and
the
alps
and
calvin
yes
those
are
the
only
three
things
in
a
thousand
years
said
the
associate
master
his
face
quite
altered
and
pale
with
suppressed
rage
really
really
associate
höy
exclaimed
schoolmistress
palm
with
a
smile
but
the
lawyer
focused
everyone
admiration
on
himself
by
telling
them
all
about
switzerland
that
wonderful
country
that
model
for
all
small
countries
of
the
world
what
social
conditions
what
a
referendum
what
planning
in
the
exploitation
of
the
country
natural
wonders
there
they
had
sanatoriums
there
they
knew
how
to
deal
with
tourists
tremendous
yes
and
what
swiss
cheese
said
the
associate
master
it
smells
like
tourists
feet
dead
silence
so
associate
master
höy
was
prepared
to
go
to
such
lengths
well
what
about
norwegian
cheese
said
a
danish
voice
mildly
yes
that
filthy
stuff
too
höy
replied
just
the
thing
for
schoolmaster
staur
pontificating
in
his
armchair
laughter
since
matters
were
now
smoothed
over
again
the
lawyer
could
safely
continue
if
we
could
only
make
such
swiss
cheese
here
he
said
we
should
not
be
so
poor
generally
speaking
i
found
after
my
modest
investigations
in
that
country
that
they
are
ahead
of
us
in
every
respect
we
have
everything
to
learn
from
them
their
frugality
their
diligence
their
long
working
hours
the
small
home
industries
and
so
on
interrupted
associate
master
höy
all
trifles
nothingness
negativity
a
country
that
exists
thanks
only
to
the
mercy
of
its
neighbors
ought
not
to
be
a
model
for
any
other
country
on
earth
we
must
try
to
rise
above
the
wretched
stench
of
it
which
only
makes
us
ill
the
big
countries
and
big
circumstances
should
be
our
model
everything
grows
even
the
small
things
unless
they
predestined
to
a
lilliput
existence
a
child
can
learn
from
another
child
of
course
but
the
model
is
the
adult
some
day
the
child
will
be
an
adult
itself
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
it
would
be
if
an
eternal
child
a
born
pygmy
were
to
be
its
model
but
that
what
all
this
rubbish
about
switzerland
really
amounts
to
why
on
earth
should
we
of
all
people
take
the
smallest
and
meanest
country
as
our
model
things
are
small
enough
here
anyhow
switzerland
is
the
serf
of
europe
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
young
south
american
country
of
norway
size
trying
to
be
on
a
level
with
switzerland
why
do
you
think
sweden
is
taking
such
great
strides
forward
now
not
because
it
looks
to
switzerland
or
to
norway
but
to
germany
honor
to
sweden
for
that
but
what
about
us
we
do
want
to
be
a
piddling
little
nation
stuck
up
in
our
mountains
a
nation
that
brings
forth
peace
conferences
and
an
ibsen
once
every
thousand
years
we
have
potentialities
for
a
thousand
times
more
the
lawyer
had
for
some
time
been
holding
up
his
hand
to
indicate
that
he
wanted
to
reply
now
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
just
a
moment
the
associate
master
stopped
just
one
question
a
small
trifling
question
said
the
lawyer
preparing
his
ground
well
have
you
ever
once
set
foot
in
the
country
you
speak
of
i
should
think
i
have
replied
the
associate
master
there
the
lawyer
got
nothing
for
his
trifling
question
and
then
it
all
came
out
what
a
heartless
jilt
molie
was
she
had
known
all
the
time
that
höy
had
been
on
a
traveling
scholarship
in
switzerland
but
she
had
never
mentioned
it
what
a
snake
in
the
grass
she
had
even
encouraged
the
lawyer
but
no
one
else
to
talk
about
switzerland
oh
yes
of
course
associate
master
höy
has
been
in
switzerland
she
said
as
though
to
clinch
the
matter
in
that
case
the
associate
master
and
i
have
looked
on
the
country
with
different
eyes
that
all
said
the
lawyer
suddenly
anxious
to
end
the
controversy
they
have
even
folk
tales
there
said
the
associate
master
who
seemed
unable
to
stop
there
they
sit
generation
after
generation
filing
watch
springs
and
piloting
englishmen
up
their
mountains
but
a
country
without
folk
music
or
folk
tales
i
suppose
you
think
we
ought
to
work
hard
to
resemble
the
swiss
in
that
too
what
about
william
tell
asked
miss
johnsen
several
of
the
ladies
nodded
or
at
any
rate
miss
palm
did
at
this
point
molie
turned
her
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
as
she
said
you
really
had
a
very
different
opinion
about
switzerland
before
mr
associate
master
this
was
a
hit
below
the
belt
he
wanted
to
reply
wanted
to
annihilate
her
but
he
restrained
himself
and
remained
silent
do
you
remember
she
asked
goading
him
no
he
replied
you
mistook
my
meaning
really
i
ca
understand
it
i
usually
make
myself
quite
clear
after
all
i
accustomed
to
explaining
to
children
another
foul
molie
said
no
more
merely
smiling
patiently
i
can
only
say
that
my
opinion
is
diametrically
opposed
to
yours
the
lawyer
repeated
but
i
did
think
he
went
on
that
this
was
one
thing
i
knew
something
about
however
molie
got
up
and
went
out
with
her
head
bent
seemingly
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
the
associate
master
sat
still
for
a
moment
and
then
followed
her
whistling
and
putting
on
as
brave
a
manner
as
though
he
felt
quite
easy
in
his
mind
what
your
opinion
asked
brede
turning
to
the
doyen
of
the
company
namely
myself
and
as
becomes
a
man
of
settled
years
i
replied
probably
there
has
been
a
little
exaggeration
on
both
sides
everybody
agreed
with
this
but
i
could
never
have
acted
as
a
mediator
for
i
thought
the
associate
master
was
right
in
one
early
seventies
one
still
has
many
pathetically
young
ideas
the
lawyer
rounded
off
the
discussion
thus
well
when
all
said
and
done
we
have
switzerland
to
thank
for
being
able
to
sit
here
at
our
ease
in
this
comfortable
mountain
resort
we
get
tourists
into
the
country
on
the
swiss
model
and
earn
money
and
pay
off
our
debts
ask
this
man
if
he
would
have
been
willing
to
do
without
all
we
have
learned
from
switzerland
that
evening
brede
asked
why
did
you
make
höy
look
so
unreasonable
today
mrs
molie
i
said
molie
innocently
well
really
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
seemed
as
though
molie
had
really
been
innocent
for
the
very
next
morning
she
and
the
associate
master
set
off
up
the
fjeld
together
in
a
very
gay
mood
and
remained
away
till
midday
if
they
had
the
matter
out
between
them
then
no
doubt
the
lady
spoke
to
her
friend
as
follows
surely
you
can
see
i
not
interested
in
that
what
an
idea
i
only
drew
him
out
so
you
have
the
chance
to
give
him
a
good
dressing
down
do
you
understand
that
really
you
the
silliest
sweetest
come
here
let
me
kiss
you
xiv
since
the
departure
of
the
great
caravan
there
have
been
no
other
visitors
some
of
us
can
not
understand
it
others
have
in
a
manner
of
speaking
got
a
whiff
of
what
is
wrong
but
all
of
us
still
believe
there
will
be
more
visitors
because
after
all
we
the
only
ones
that
have
the
tore
peaks
but
no
one
appears
the
women
of
the
house
do
their
daily
work
for
the
inmates
and
do
not
complain
but
they
are
not
happy
paul
still
takes
things
quietly
he
sleeps
a
great
deal
in
his
room
behind
the
kitchen
but
once
or
twice
i
have
seen
him
walking
away
from
the
house
at
night
walking
in
deep
thought
toward
the
woods
from
the
neighboring
valley
comes
the
rumor
that
the
motor
traffic
has
started
there
now
so
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
quiet
in
our
valley
then
one
day
a
dane
came
down
to
us
from
the
fjeld
he
had
climbed
the
tore
peaks
from
the
other
side
something
that
had
been
thought
impossible
till
now
he
had
simply
driven
in
a
car
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
walked
across
so
we
no
longer
had
the
tore
peaks
to
ourselves
either
i
wonder
whether
after
all
paul
is
not
going
to
try
to
sow
in
the
long
strip
of
land
down
by
the
river
that
at
any
rate
had
been
his
original
intention
but
then
came
the
great
caravan
and
he
neglected
it
now
of
course
the
season
is
too
far
advanced
for
sowing
and
there
will
be
nothing
but
docks
and
chickweed
could
not
the
field
be
turfed
at
least
and
sown
why
did
paul
think
of
such
things
instead
of
walking
the
woods
at
night
but
paul
has
many
thoughts
at
an
early
age
his
interest
in
farming
was
diverted
to
the
tourist
traffic
and
there
it
has
remained
he
hears
that
our
lawyer
is
also
an
architect
and
asks
him
to
draw
a
plan
for
the
big
new
house
with
the
six
rooms
the
hall
and
the
bathroom
paul
has
already
ordered
the
log
chairs
and
the
reindeer
horns
for
the
hall
if
you
were
alone
up
here
you
might
have
got
some
of
the
cars
coming
here
too
said
the
lawyer
i
thought
of
that
paul
replied
it
not
impossible
i
can
do
something
about
it
but
i
must
have
the
house
first
and
i
must
have
a
road
the
lawyer
promised
to
draw
a
plan
of
the
house
and
went
round
to
look
at
the
site
the
house
was
to
cost
such
and
such
a
sum
paul
was
already
quite
convinced
that
three
or
four
good
tourist
summers
would
pay
it
off
paul
was
not
worrying
as
we
looked
over
the
site
together
i
discovered
that
he
smelled
of
brandy
finally
a
small
party
of
norwegians
and
foreigners
arrived
travelers
who
were
out
to
walk
and
not
to
drive
in
cars
everyone
spirits
rose
the
strangers
stayed
a
few
days
and
nights
and
were
guided
across
the
fjeld
by
solem
who
earned
a
fair
penny
paul
too
was
visibly
cheered
and
strolled
about
the
farm
in
his
sunday
clothes
he
had
a
few
things
to
discuss
with
the
lawyer
about
the
house
if
there
anything
to
consult
about
we
had
better
do
it
now
he
said
i
shall
be
away
for
a
couple
of
days
so
they
attended
to
a
few
minor
matters
are
you
going
to
town
asked
the
lawyer
no
paul
replied
only
down
to
the
village
i
want
to
see
if
i
can
get
the
people
there
to
on
a
few
ideas
of
mine
a
telephone
and
automobile
service
and
so
on
good
luck
said
the
lawyer
so
the
lawyer
sat
drafting
plans
while
the
rest
of
us
went
about
our
own
affairs
josephine
went
to
solem
and
said
will
you
go
and
sow
the
field
by
the
river
has
paul
said
so
he
asked
yes
she
replied
solem
went
very
unwillingly
while
he
was
drawing
the
harrow
josephine
went
down
to
him
and
said
harrow
it
once
more
what
a
brisk
little
thing
she
was
with
far
more
forethought
than
the
men
she
looked
bewitching
for
all
her
hard
work
i
have
seen
her
many
times
with
her
hair
tumbled
but
it
did
matter
and
when
she
pretended
that
none
but
the
maids
milked
the
goats
and
did
outside
work
it
was
for
the
good
name
of
the
house
she
had
learned
to
play
the
piano
for
the
same
reason
the
mistress
of
the
house
helped
her
nobly
for
both
women
were
thoughtful
and
industrious
but
josephine
was
everywhere
for
she
was
light
as
a
feather
and
the
chaste
little
hands
she
had
josephine
joséfriendly
i
called
her
wittily
xv
our
dark
beauty
miss
torsen
was
now
seriously
considering
taking
her
departure
she
was
healthy
enough
in
any
case
so
she
did
not
need
a
stay
in
the
mountains
on
that
account
and
if
she
was
bored
why
should
she
stay
but
a
minor
event
caused
her
to
stay
in
their
lack
of
occupation
the
ladies
at
the
resort
began
to
cultivate
solem
they
ate
so
much
and
grew
so
fat
and
healthy
that
they
felt
a
need
to
busy
themselves
with
something
and
to
find
someone
to
make
a
fuss
over
and
here
was
the
lad
solem
they
got
into
the
habit
of
telling
one
another
what
solem
had
said
and
what
solem
believed
and
they
all
listened
with
great
interest
solem
himself
had
grown
spoiled
and
joked
disrespectfully
with
the
ladies
he
called
himself
a
great
chap
and
once
he
had
even
bragged
in
a
most
improper
way
saying
look
here
a
sinful
devil
for
you
do
you
know
what
solem
said
to
me
asked
miss
palm
he
chopping
wood
and
he
got
a
bandage
on
his
finger
and
it
keeps
getting
caught
in
the
wood
and
bothers
him
poor
fellow
so
he
said
wish
i
had
time
to
stop
so
i
could
chop
this
blasted
finger
right
off
my
hand
tough
is
he
said
the
other
ladies
he
quite
capable
of
doing
it
too
a
little
later
i
passed
the
woodshed
and
saw
brede
there
tying
a
fresh
bandage
on
solem
finger
poor
lady
she
was
chaste
but
young
the
days
have
been
oppressively
warm
for
some
time
now
with
the
heat
coming
down
in
waves
from
the
mountain
and
robbing
us
of
all
our
strength
but
in
the
evenings
we
recovered
somewhat
and
busied
ourselves
in
various
ways
some
of
us
wrote
letters
or
played
forfeit
games
in
the
garden
while
others
were
so
far
restored
that
they
went
for
a
walk
to
look
at
nature
last
sunday
evening
i
stood
talking
to
solem
outside
his
room
he
had
on
his
sunday
clothes
and
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
going
to
bed
miss
torsen
came
by
stopped
and
said
i
hear
you
going
for
a
walk
with
mrs
brede
solem
removed
his
cap
which
left
a
red
ring
round
his
forehead
who
me
he
said
well
maybe
she
said
something
about
it
there
was
a
path
through
the
woods
she
wanted
me
to
show
her
she
said
miss
torsen
was
filled
with
madness
now
handsome
and
desperate
she
paced
back
and
forth
you
could
almost
see
the
sparks
flying
her
red
felt
hat
was
held
on
the
back
of
her
head
by
a
pin
the
brim
turned
up
high
in
front
her
throat
was
bare
her
frock
thin
her
shoes
light
it
was
extraordinary
to
watch
her
behavior
she
had
opened
a
window
onto
her
secret
desires
what
cared
she
for
tradesman
batt
had
she
not
toiled
through
her
youth
and
gained
school
knowledge
but
no
reality
poor
miss
torsen
solem
must
not
show
a
path
to
any
other
lady
tonight
as
nothing
more
was
said
and
solem
was
preparing
to
depart
miss
torsen
cleared
her
throat
come
with
me
instead
she
said
solem
looked
round
quickly
and
said
all
right
so
i
left
them
i
whistled
as
i
walked
away
with
exaggerated
indifference
as
though
nothing
on
earth
were
any
concern
of
mine
come
with
me
instead
she
said
and
he
went
they
were
already
behind
the
outhouses
then
behind
the
two
great
rowan
trees
they
hurried
lest
brede
should
see
them
then
they
were
gone
a
door
wide
open
but
where
did
it
lead
i
saw
no
sweetness
in
her
nothing
but
excitement
she
had
learned
grammar
but
no
language
her
soul
was
undernourished
a
true
woman
would
have
married
she
would
have
been
a
man
wife
she
would
have
been
a
mother
she
would
have
been
a
benediction
to
herself
why
pounce
on
a
pleasure
merely
to
prevent
others
from
having
it
and
she
so
tall
and
handsome
the
dog
stands
growling
over
a
bone
he
waits
till
another
dog
approaches
then
suddenly
he
is
overcome
with
gluttony
pounces
on
the
bone
and
crushes
it
between
his
teeth
because
the
other
dog
is
approaching
it
seemed
as
though
this
small
event
had
to
happen
before
my
mind
was
ready
for
the
night
i
awoke
in
the
dark
and
felt
within
me
the
nursery
rhyme
i
had
dawdled
over
so
long
four
rollicking
verses
about
the
juniper
tree
to
the
top
of
the
steepest
mountains
where
the
little
juniper
stands
no
other
tree
can
follow
from
all
the
forest
lands
halfway
to
the
hilltop
the
shivering
pine
catches
hold
the
birch
has
actually
passed
him
though
sneezing
with
a
cold
but
a
little
shrub
outstrips
them
a
sturdy
fellow
he
and
stands
quite
close
to
the
summit
though
he
measures
barely
a
yard
they
look
like
a
train
from
the
valley
below
with
the
shortest
one
for
the
guard
or
else
perhaps
he
a
coachman
now
why
it
only
a
juniper
tree
down
dale
there
summer
lightning
green
leaves
and
john
feast
with
songs
and
games
of
children
and
a
dozen
dances
at
least
but
high
on
the
empty
mountain
stands
a
shrub
in
lonely
glory
with
only
the
trolls
that
prowl
about
just
like
in
a
story
the
wind
with
the
juniper
forelock
is
making
very
free
it
sweeps
across
the
world
beneath
that
lies
there
helpless
and
bare
but
the
air
on
the
heights
is
fresher
than
you
ever
find
it
elsewhere
none
can
see
so
far
around
as
such
a
juniper
tree
there
hovers
over
the
mountain
for
a
moment
summer
breath
at
once
eternal
winter
brings
back
his
companion
death
yet
sturdy
stands
the
juniper
with
needles
ever
green
i
wonder
how
the
little
chap
can
bear
a
life
so
lean
he
hard
as
bone
and
gristle
as
anyone
can
see
when
every
other
tree
is
stripped
his
berries
are
scarlet
and
sleek
and
every
berry
plainly
marked
with
a
cross
upon
its
cheek
so
now
we
know
what
he
looks
like
too
this
jolly
juniper
tree
at
times
i
think
he
sings
to
himself
a
cheerful
little
song
i
got
a
bright
blue
heaven
to
look
at
all
day
long
sometimes
to
his
juniper
brothers
he
calls
that
they
need
not
fear
the
trolls
that
are
prowling
and
peering
about
them
far
and
near
gently
the
winter
evening
falls
over
the
copse
on
the
height
and
a
thousand
stars
and
candles
are
lit
in
the
plains
of
the
sky
the
juniper
trees
grow
weary
and
nod
their
heads
on
the
sly
before
we
know
it
they
fast
asleep
so
we
say
good
night
good
night
i
got
up
and
wrote
out
these
rhymes
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
i
sent
to
a
little
girl
a
child
with
whom
i
had
walked
much
in
the
country
and
she
learned
them
at
once
then
i
read
them
to
brede
little
girls
who
stood
still
like
two
bluebells
listening
then
they
tore
the
paper
out
of
my
hand
and
ran
to
their
mother
with
it
they
loved
their
mother
very
much
and
she
loved
them
too
they
had
the
most
delightful
fun
together
at
bedtime
brave
brede
with
her
children
she
might
have
committed
a
madness
but
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
do
so
yet
did
anyone
prize
her
for
that
who
her
husband
a
man
should
take
his
wife
to
iceland
with
him
or
risk
the
consequences
of
her
being
left
behind
for
endless
days
xvi
miss
torsen
no
longer
talks
about
leaving
not
that
she
looks
very
happy
about
staying
either
but
miss
torsen
is
altogether
too
restless
and
strange
to
be
contented
with
anything
naturally
she
caught
cold
after
that
evening
in
the
woods
with
solem
and
stayed
in
bed
with
a
headache
next
day
when
she
got
up
again
she
was
quite
all
right
was
she
why
was
her
throat
so
blue
under
the
chin
as
though
someone
had
seized
her
by
it
she
never
went
near
solem
any
more
and
behaved
as
though
he
were
nonexistent
apparently
there
had
been
a
struggle
in
the
woods
that
had
made
her
blue
under
the
chin
and
they
were
friends
no
longer
it
was
like
her
to
want
nothing
real
nothing
but
the
sensation
nothing
but
the
triumph
solem
had
not
understood
that
and
had
flown
into
a
passion
had
it
been
thus
yes
there
was
no
doubt
that
solem
had
been
cheated
he
was
more
direct
and
lacked
subtlety
he
made
allusions
and
said
things
like
oh
yes
that
miss
torsen
she
a
fine
one
i
bet
she
as
strong
as
a
man
and
then
he
laughed
but
with
repressed
fury
he
followed
her
with
gross
eyes
wherever
she
went
and
in
order
to
assert
himself
and
seem
indifferent
he
would
sing
a
song
of
the
linesman
life
whenever
she
was
about
but
he
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
miss
torsen
was
to
his
songs
and
now
it
seemed
she
was
going
to
stay
at
the
resort
out
of
sheer
defiance
we
enjoyed
her
company
no
more
than
we
had
done
before
but
she
began
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
the
lawyer
sitting
by
his
work
table
in
the
living
room
as
he
drew
plans
of
houses
such
is
the
perverse
idleness
of
summer
resorts
so
the
days
pass
they
hold
no
further
novelty
for
me
and
i
begin
to
weary
of
them
now
and
then
comes
a
stranger
who
is
going
across
the
fjeld
but
things
are
no
longer
i
am
told
as
they
were
in
other
years
when
visitors
came
in
droves
and
things
will
not
improve
until
we
too
get
roads
and
cars
i
have
not
troubled
to
mention
it
before
this
but
the
neighboring
valley
is
called
stordalen
great
valley
while
ours
is
only
called
reisa
after
the
river
the
whole
of
the
reisa
district
is
no
more
than
an
appendage
stordalen
has
all
the
advantages
even
the
name
but
paul
our
host
calls
the
neighboring
valley
little
valley
because
says
paul
the
people
there
are
so
petty
and
avaricious
poor
paul
he
has
returned
from
his
tour
to
the
village
as
hopeless
as
he
went
and
hopelessly
drunk
besides
for
more
than
a
day
he
stayed
in
his
room
without
once
emerging
when
he
reappeared
at
last
he
was
aloof
and
reserved
pretending
he
had
been
very
successful
during
his
absence
he
should
manage
about
the
cars
never
fear
in
the
evening
after
he
had
had
a
few
more
drinks
he
became
in
a
different
way
oh
those
fools
in
the
village
had
no
sense
of
any
kind
and
had
refused
to
give
their
consent
to
a
road
to
his
place
he
was
the
only
one
with
any
sense
would
not
such
a
bit
of
a
road
be
a
blessing
to
the
whole
appendage
because
then
the
caravans
would
come
scattering
money
over
the
valley
they
understood
nothing
those
fools
but
sooner
or
later
there
will
have
to
be
a
road
here
said
the
lawyer
of
course
replied
paul
with
finality
then
he
went
to
his
room
and
lay
down
again
on
another
day
a
small
flock
of
strangers
came
again
they
had
toiled
up
themselves
carrying
their
luggage
in
the
hot
sun
and
now
they
wanted
some
help
solem
was
ready
at
once
but
he
could
not
possibly
carry
all
the
bags
and
knapsacks
paul
was
lying
down
in
his
room
i
had
seen
paul
again
during
the
night
go
out
to
the
woods
talking
loudly
and
flinging
his
arms
about
as
though
he
had
company
and
here
were
all
the
strangers
paul
wife
and
josephine
came
out
of
the
house
and
sent
solem
across
to
einar
the
first
cotter
to
ask
if
he
would
come
and
help
them
carry
in
the
meantime
the
travelers
grew
impatient
and
kept
looking
at
their
watches
for
if
they
could
not
cross
the
tore
fjeld
before
nightfall
they
would
have
to
spend
the
night
outdoors
one
of
them
suggested
to
the
others
that
perhaps
this
delay
was
intentional
the
owner
of
the
place
probably
wanted
them
to
spend
the
night
there
they
began
to
grumble
among
themselves
and
at
last
they
asked
where
is
the
master
the
host
he
ill
said
josephine
solem
returned
and
said
einar
has
time
to
come
he
lifting
his
potatoes
a
pause
then
josephine
said
i
got
to
go
across
the
fjeld
anyhow
wait
a
minute
she
was
gone
for
a
moment
then
returned
loaded
the
bags
and
knapsacks
on
her
little
back
and
trotted
off
the
others
followed
i
caught
up
with
josephine
and
took
her
burden
from
her
but
i
would
not
allow
her
to
turn
back
for
this
little
tour
away
from
the
house
would
do
her
good
we
walked
together
and
talked
on
the
way
she
had
really
no
complaints
she
said
for
she
had
a
tidy
sum
of
money
saved
up
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
fjeld
josephine
wanted
to
turn
back
she
thought
it
a
waste
of
time
to
walk
by
my
side
with
nothing
to
do
but
walk
i
thought
you
had
to
cross
the
fjeld
anyhow
i
said
she
was
too
shrewd
to
deny
it
outright
for
in
that
case
she
the
daughter
of
the
old
man
at
the
tore
peak
farm
would
have
been
going
with
the
tourists
solely
to
carry
their
luggage
yes
but
there
no
hurry
i
was
to
have
visited
someone
but
that
can
wait
till
the
winter
we
stood
arguing
about
this
and
i
was
so
stubborn
that
i
threatened
to
throw
all
the
luggage
down
the
mountainside
and
then
she
would
see
then
i
just
take
them
and
carry
them
myself
replied
josephine
and
then
see
by
this
time
the
others
had
caught
up
with
us
and
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
one
of
the
strangers
had
come
forward
and
lifted
the
burden
from
my
back
taken
off
his
cap
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
and
told
me
his
own
and
his
companions
names
i
must
excuse
them
i
really
must
forgive
them
this
was
too
bad
he
had
been
so
unobserving
i
told
him
i
could
easily
have
carried
him
as
well
as
the
bags
it
is
not
strength
i
lack
but
day
and
night
i
carry
about
with
me
the
ape
of
all
the
diseases
who
is
heavy
as
lead
ah
well
many
another
groans
under
a
burden
of
stupidity
which
is
little
better
we
all
have
our
cross
to
bear
then
josephine
and
i
turned
homeward
again
yes
indeed
people
treat
me
with
uncontrollable
politeness
this
is
because
of
my
age
people
are
indulgent
toward
me
when
i
am
troublesome
to
others
when
i
am
eccentric
when
i
have
a
screw
loose
people
forgive
me
because
my
hair
is
gray
you
who
live
by
your
compass
will
say
that
i
am
respected
for
the
writing
i
have
been
doing
all
these
years
but
if
that
were
so
i
should
have
had
respect
in
my
young
days
when
i
deserved
it
not
now
when
i
no
longer
deserve
it
so
well
no
one
no
one
in
the
world
can
be
expected
to
write
after
fifty
nearly
so
well
as
before
and
only
the
fools
or
the
pretend
to
improve
after
that
age
now
it
is
a
fact
that
i
have
been
practicing
a
most
distinctive
authorship
better
than
most
i
know
that
very
well
but
this
is
due
not
so
much
to
my
endeavors
as
to
the
fact
that
i
was
born
with
this
ability
i
have
made
a
test
of
this
and
i
know
it
is
true
i
have
thought
to
myself
suppose
someone
else
had
said
this
well
no
doubt
others
have
said
it
sometimes
but
that
has
not
hurt
me
i
have
gone
even
further
than
this
i
have
intentionally
exposed
myself
to
direct
contempt
from
other
literary
men
and
this
has
not
hurt
me
either
so
i
am
sure
of
my
ground
on
the
other
hand
my
way
of
life
has
lent
me
an
inner
distinction
for
which
i
have
a
right
to
demand
respect
because
it
is
the
fruit
of
my
own
endeavors
you
can
not
make
me
out
a
small
man
without
lying
yet
one
can
endure
even
such
a
lie
if
one
has
character
you
may
quote
carlyle
against
me
how
authors
are
misjudged
what
do
in
the
world
and
what
the
world
does
with
i
should
say
it
is
the
most
anomalous
thing
the
world
at
present
has
to
you
may
quote
many
others
as
well
they
will
assert
that
a
great
is
made
over
me
for
my
authorship
as
well
as
my
native
ability
and
my
struggle
to
hammer
this
ability
into
a
useful
shape
and
i
say
only
what
is
the
truth
that
most
of
the
fuss
is
made
because
i
have
reached
an
age
in
which
my
years
are
revered
and
that
is
what
seems
to
me
so
wrong
it
is
a
custom
which
makes
it
easy
to
hold
down
the
gifted
young
in
a
most
hostile
and
arrogant
fashion
old
age
should
not
be
honored
for
its
own
sake
it
does
nothing
but
halt
and
delay
the
march
of
man
the
primitive
races
indeed
have
no
respect
for
old
age
and
rid
themselves
unhesitatingly
of
it
and
of
its
defects
a
long
time
ago
i
deserved
honor
much
more
and
valued
it
now
in
more
than
one
sense
i
am
a
richer
man
and
can
afford
to
do
without
yet
now
i
have
it
if
i
enter
a
room
respectful
silence
falls
how
old
he
grown
everyone
present
thinks
and
they
all
remain
silent
so
that
i
may
speak
memorable
words
in
that
room
amazing
nonsense
the
noise
should
raise
the
roof
when
i
enter
welcome
old
fellow
and
old
companion
for
pity
sake
do
say
anything
memorable
to
us
you
should
have
done
that
when
you
were
better
able
to
sit
down
old
chap
and
keep
us
company
but
do
let
your
old
age
cast
a
shadow
on
us
and
restrain
us
you
have
had
your
day
now
it
our
turn
this
is
honest
speech
in
peasant
homes
they
still
have
the
right
instinct
the
mothers
preserve
their
daughters
the
fathers
their
sons
from
the
rough
unpleasant
labors
a
proper
mother
lets
her
daughter
sew
while
she
herself
works
among
the
cattle
and
the
daughter
will
do
the
same
with
her
own
daughter
it
is
her
instinct
xvii
dear
me
these
human
beings
grow
duller
every
day
and
i
see
nothing
in
them
that
i
have
not
known
before
so
i
sink
to
the
level
of
watching
solem
increasing
passion
for
miss
torsen
but
that
too
is
familiar
and
dull
solem
after
all
the
attention
the
ladies
have
paid
him
has
a
delusion
of
greatness
he
buys
clothes
and
gilt
watch
chains
for
the
money
he
earns
and
on
sundays
wears
a
white
woolen
pullover
though
it
is
very
warm
round
his
neck
and
over
his
chest
lies
a
costly
silk
tie
tied
in
a
sailor
knot
no
one
else
is
so
smart
as
he
as
he
well
knows
he
sings
as
he
crosses
the
farmyard
and
considers
no
one
too
good
for
him
now
josephine
objects
to
his
loud
singing
but
solem
lad
has
grown
so
indispensable
at
the
resort
that
he
no
longer
obeys
all
orders
he
has
his
own
will
in
many
things
and
sometimes
paul
himself
takes
a
glass
in
his
company
miss
torsen
appears
to
have
settled
down
she
is
very
busy
with
the
lawyer
and
makes
him
explain
each
and
every
angle
he
draws
in
his
plans
quite
right
of
her
too
for
undeniably
the
lawyer
is
the
right
man
for
her
a
wit
and
a
sportsman
rather
at
first
molie
seemed
unable
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
constant
companionship
of
these
two
in
the
living
room
and
she
frequently
had
some
errand
that
took
her
there
what
was
she
after
molie
of
the
teeth
at
last
the
lawyer
finished
his
plans
and
was
able
to
deliver
them
he
began
to
speak
again
about
a
certain
peak
of
the
tore
range
which
no
one
had
yet
climbed
and
was
therefore
waiting
to
be
conquered
by
him
miss
torsen
objected
to
this
plan
and
as
she
grew
to
know
him
better
begged
him
most
earnestly
not
to
undertake
such
a
mad
climb
so
he
promised
with
a
smile
to
obey
her
wishes
they
were
in
such
tender
agreement
these
two
but
the
blue
peak
still
haunted
the
lawyer
mind
he
pointed
it
out
to
his
lady
and
smacked
his
lips
his
eyes
watering
again
gracious
it
makes
me
dizzy
just
to
look
at
it
she
said
so
the
lawyer
put
his
arm
round
her
to
steady
her
the
sight
was
painful
to
solem
whose
eyes
were
continually
on
the
pair
one
day
as
we
left
the
luncheon
table
he
approached
miss
torsen
and
said
i
know
another
path
would
you
like
to
see
it
tonight
the
lady
was
confused
and
a
little
embarrassed
and
said
at
length
a
path
no
thank
you
she
turned
to
the
lawyer
and
as
they
walked
away
together
she
said
i
never
heard
of
such
brazenness
what
got
into
him
said
the
lawyer
solem
went
away
his
teeth
gleaming
in
a
sneer
that
evening
solem
repeated
the
performance
he
went
up
to
miss
torsen
again
and
said
what
about
that
path
shall
we
go
now
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
coming
she
turned
quickly
and
tried
to
elude
him
but
solem
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
her
now
i
just
got
one
thing
to
say
she
said
stopping
if
insolent
to
me
again
i
see
that
you
driven
off
the
farm
but
it
was
not
easy
to
drive
solem
off
the
farm
after
all
he
was
guide
and
porter
to
the
tourists
and
the
only
permanent
laborer
on
the
farm
as
well
and
soon
the
hay
would
have
to
be
brought
in
and
casual
laborers
would
be
engaged
to
work
under
him
no
solem
could
not
be
driven
off
besides
the
other
ladies
were
on
his
side
the
mighty
brede
alone
could
save
him
by
a
word
she
held
the
tore
peak
resort
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
solem
was
not
discharged
but
he
held
himself
in
check
and
became
a
little
more
civil
he
seemed
to
suffer
as
much
as
ever
once
at
midday
as
he
was
standing
in
the
woodshed
i
saw
him
make
a
scratch
with
the
ax
across
the
nail
of
his
thumb
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
i
asked
oh
i
just
marking
myself
he
replied
laughing
gloomily
when
this
scratch
grows
out
he
stopped
what
then
oh
i
be
away
from
here
then
he
said
but
i
had
the
impression
that
he
meant
to
say
something
different
so
i
probed
further
let
me
look
well
it
not
a
deep
scratch
you
wo
be
here
long
then
will
you
nails
grow
slowly
he
muttered
then
he
strolled
away
whistling
and
i
set
about
chopping
wood
a
little
later
solem
returned
across
the
farmyard
with
a
cackling
hen
under
his
arm
he
went
to
the
kitchen
window
and
called
this
the
kind
of
hen
you
want
me
to
kill
yes
was
the
reply
solem
came
back
to
the
woodshed
and
asked
me
for
the
ax
as
he
wanted
to
behead
a
few
hens
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
did
everything
on
the
farm
he
was
hand
and
brain
indispensable
he
laid
the
hen
on
a
block
and
took
aim
but
it
was
not
easy
for
she
twisted
her
head
like
a
snake
and
would
not
lie
still
she
had
stopped
cackling
now
i
can
feel
her
heart
jumping
inside
her
said
solem
suddenly
he
saw
his
chance
and
struck
there
lay
the
head
solem
still
held
the
body
which
jerked
under
his
hand
the
thing
was
done
so
quickly
that
the
two
sections
of
the
bird
were
still
one
in
my
eyes
i
could
not
grasp
a
separation
so
sudden
and
unbelievable
and
it
took
my
sight
a
second
or
two
to
overtake
the
event
bewilderment
was
in
the
expression
of
this
detached
head
which
looked
as
though
it
could
not
believe
what
had
happened
and
raised
itself
a
little
as
if
to
show
there
was
nothing
the
least
bit
wrong
solem
let
the
body
go
it
lay
still
for
a
moment
then
kicked
its
legs
leaped
to
the
ground
and
began
to
hop
the
headless
body
reeling
on
one
wing
till
it
struck
the
wall
and
spattered
blood
in
wide
arcs
before
it
fell
at
last
i
let
her
go
too
soon
after
all
said
solem
then
he
went
off
to
fetch
another
hen
xviii
i
return
to
the
mad
idea
of
solem
being
discharged
this
would
to
be
sure
have
averted
a
certain
disaster
here
at
the
farm
but
who
would
fetch
and
carry
then
paul
but
i
told
you
he
just
lounges
all
day
in
his
room
and
has
been
doing
so
lately
more
than
ever
the
guests
never
see
him
except
through
an
unsuccessful
maneuver
on
his
part
one
evening
he
came
walking
across
the
lawn
he
must
in
his
disregard
of
time
have
thought
the
guests
had
already
retired
but
we
all
sat
outside
in
the
mild
darkness
when
paul
saw
us
he
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
as
he
passed
then
calling
solem
to
him
he
said
you
must
cross
the
field
again
without
letting
me
know
i
was
right
there
in
my
room
writing
the
idea
of
josephine
carrying
luggage
paul
strode
on
but
even
yet
he
felt
he
had
not
appeared
important
enough
so
he
turned
round
and
asked
why
did
you
take
one
of
my
cotters
with
you
to
act
as
porter
they
would
go
solem
replied
they
were
busy
lifting
potatoes
would
go
that
what
einar
said
paul
thought
this
over
what
insolence
they
better
not
go
too
far
or
i
drive
them
off
the
place
then
the
law
awoke
in
the
lawyer
bosom
and
he
asked
have
they
bought
their
land
yes
said
paul
but
i
the
master
of
this
farm
i
have
a
say
in
things
too
i
not
without
power
up
here
in
reisa
believe
me
then
he
said
sternly
to
solem
you
come
to
me
next
time
whereupon
he
stalked
off
to
the
woods
again
he
a
bit
tight
again
our
good
paul
said
the
lawyer
nobody
replied
can
you
imagine
an
innkeeper
in
switzerland
behaving
like
that
the
lawyer
remarked
brede
said
gently
what
a
pity
he
never
drank
before
and
at
once
the
lawyer
was
charitable
again
i
have
a
good
talk
with
him
he
said
there
followed
a
period
in
which
paul
was
sober
from
morning
till
night
when
manufacturer
brede
paid
us
a
visit
the
flag
was
hoisted
and
there
was
great
commotion
at
the
farm
josephine
feet
said
under
her
skirt
the
manufacturer
arrived
with
a
porter
his
wife
and
children
went
far
down
the
road
to
meet
him
and
the
visitors
at
the
resort
sallied
forth
too
good
morning
he
greeted
us
with
a
great
flourish
of
his
hat
he
won
us
all
over
he
was
big
and
friendly
fat
and
cheerful
with
the
broad
good
cheer
that
plenty
of
money
gives
he
became
good
friends
with
us
at
once
how
long
are
you
staying
daddy
his
little
girls
asked
as
they
clung
to
him
three
days
is
that
all
said
his
wife
is
that
all
he
replied
laughing
that
not
such
a
short
time
my
dear
three
days
is
a
lot
for
me
but
not
for
me
and
the
children
she
said
three
whole
days
he
repeated
i
can
tell
you
i
had
to
do
some
moving
to
be
able
to
stay
as
quiet
as
this
ha
ha
they
all
went
in
the
manufacturer
had
been
here
before
and
knew
the
way
to
his
wife
cottage
he
ordered
soda
water
at
once
in
the
evening
when
the
children
had
gone
to
bed
the
manufacturer
and
his
wife
joined
us
in
the
living
room
he
had
brought
whisky
with
him
for
the
gentlemen
and
ordered
soda
water
for
the
ladies
he
had
wine
it
was
quite
a
little
party
the
manufacturer
playing
the
host
with
skill
and
we
were
all
well
satisfied
when
miss
palm
played
folk
melodies
on
the
piano
this
man
grew
quiet
and
sentimental
but
he
did
think
only
of
himself
for
suddenly
he
went
out
and
lowered
the
flag
flags
should
be
lowered
at
sunset
he
said
once
or
twice
he
went
across
to
the
cottage
too
to
see
if
the
children
were
sleeping
well
generally
speaking
he
seemed
fond
of
the
children
though
he
owned
factories
and
hotels
and
many
other
things
yet
he
seemed
to
take
the
greatest
pride
of
all
in
possessing
a
couple
of
children
one
of
the
men
from
bergen
struck
his
glass
for
silence
and
began
to
make
a
speech
the
bergensians
had
all
long
been
very
quiet
and
retiring
but
here
was
a
perfect
occasion
for
making
speeches
was
not
here
a
man
from
the
great
world
outside
from
the
heart
of
life
who
had
brought
them
wine
and
good
cheer
and
festivity
strange
wares
up
here
in
this
world
of
blue
mountains
and
so
on
he
talked
for
about
five
minutes
and
became
very
animated
the
manufacturer
told
us
a
little
about
iceland
a
neutral
country
that
neither
the
associate
master
nor
the
lawyer
had
visited
and
therefore
could
not
disagree
about
one
of
the
danes
had
been
there
and
was
able
to
confirm
the
justness
of
the
manufacturer
impressions
but
most
of
the
time
he
told
cheerful
anecdotes
i
have
a
servant
a
young
lad
who
said
to
me
one
day
when
i
was
in
a
bad
temper
become
a
great
hand
at
swearing
in
icelandic
ha
ha
ha
he
appreciated
me
great
hand
at
swearing
in
icelandic
he
said
everybody
laughed
and
his
wife
asked
and
what
did
you
say
what
did
i
say
why
i
could
say
anything
could
i
ha
ha
ha
then
another
man
from
bergen
took
the
floor
we
must
not
forget
we
had
the
family
of
a
real
man
of
the
world
with
us
here
his
wife
this
peerless
lady
scattering
charm
and
delight
about
her
and
the
children
dancing
butterflies
and
a
few
minutes
later
hip
hip
hurrah
followed
by
a
flourish
on
the
piano
the
manufacturer
drank
a
toast
with
his
wife
well
that
that
was
all
he
said
molie
sat
off
in
a
corner
talking
in
a
loud
voice
with
the
dane
who
had
come
over
the
top
of
the
tore
from
the
wrong
end
she
seemed
purposely
to
be
talking
so
audibly
the
manufacturer
attention
was
attracted
and
he
asked
for
further
information
about
the
motor
cars
in
the
neighboring
valley
how
many
there
were
and
how
fast
they
could
go
the
dane
told
him
but
just
imagine
coming
across
the
fjeld
from
the
other
side
said
molie
it
has
been
done
before
in
response
to
the
manufacturer
questions
the
dane
told
him
about
this
adventurous
journey
also
is
there
a
blue
peak
somewhere
in
the
mountains
about
here
said
molie
i
suppose
you
be
going
up
that
next
where
ever
will
you
stop
yes
the
dane
felt
quite
tempted
by
this
peak
but
said
he
believed
it
was
unconquerable
i
should
have
climbed
that
peak
long
ago
if
you
miss
torsen
forbidden
me
said
the
lawyer
you
never
have
made
it
said
molie
in
an
indifferent
tone
this
was
probably
her
revenge
she
turned
to
the
dane
again
as
though
ready
to
believe
him
capable
of
anything
i
should
want
anyone
to
think
of
climbing
that
peak
said
miss
torsen
it
as
bare
as
a
ship
mast
what
if
i
tried
it
gerda
the
manufacturer
asked
his
wife
with
a
smile
after
all
i
an
old
sailor
nonsense
she
said
smiling
a
little
well
i
climbed
the
mast
of
a
schooner
last
spring
where
in
iceland
what
for
i
do
know
though
all
this
mountain
climbing
i
have
much
use
for
it
said
the
manufacturer
what
did
you
do
it
for
what
did
you
climb
the
mast
for
his
wife
repeated
nervously
the
manufacturer
laughed
the
curiosity
of
the
female
sex
how
can
you
do
a
thing
like
that
and
what
about
me
and
the
children
if
you
she
broke
off
her
husband
grew
serious
and
took
her
hand
it
was
stormy
my
dear
the
sails
were
flapping
and
it
was
a
question
of
life
and
death
but
i
should
have
told
you
well
we
better
say
good
night
now
gerda
the
manufacturer
and
his
wife
got
up
then
the
first
man
from
bergen
made
another
speech
the
manufacturer
stayed
with
us
for
the
promised
three
days
and
then
made
ready
to
travel
again
his
mood
never
changed
he
was
contented
and
entertaining
the
whole
time
every
evening
one
whisky
and
soda
was
brought
him
no
more
before
their
bedtime
his
little
girls
had
a
wildly
hilarious
with
him
at
night
a
tremendous
snoring
could
be
heard
from
his
cottage
before
his
arrival
the
little
girls
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
with
me
but
now
they
no
longer
knew
i
existed
so
taken
up
with
their
father
were
they
he
hung
a
swing
for
them
between
the
two
rowan
trees
in
the
field
taking
care
to
pack
plenty
of
rag
under
the
rope
so
as
not
to
injure
the
tree
he
also
had
a
talk
with
paul
there
were
rumors
that
he
was
intending
to
take
his
money
out
of
the
tore
peak
resort
paul
head
was
bent
now
but
he
seemed
even
more
hurt
that
the
manufacturer
should
have
paid
a
visit
to
the
cotters
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
so
that
where
he
gone
he
said
well
let
him
stay
there
for
all
i
care
the
manufacturer
cracked
jokes
to
the
very
end
of
course
he
was
a
little
depressed
by
the
farewells
too
but
he
had
to
keep
his
family
courage
up
his
wife
stood
holding
one
of
his
arms
with
both
hands
and
the
children
clung
to
his
other
arm
i
ca
salute
you
the
manufacturer
said
to
us
smiling
i
not
allowed
to
say
the
children
rejoiced
at
this
and
cried
no
he
ca
have
his
arm
back
mummy
you
hold
him
tight
too
come
come
the
father
said
i
got
to
go
to
scotland
just
a
short
trip
and
when
you
come
home
from
the
mountains
i
be
there
too
scotland
what
are
you
going
to
scotland
for
the
children
asked
he
twisted
round
and
nodded
to
us
these
women
all
curiosity
he
said
but
none
of
his
family
laughed
he
continued
to
us
i
was
telling
my
wife
a
story
about
a
rich
man
who
was
curious
too
he
shot
himself
just
to
find
out
what
comes
after
death
ha
ha
ha
the
height
of
curiosity
is
it
shooting
yourself
to
find
out
what
comes
after
death
but
he
could
not
make
his
family
laugh
at
this
tale
either
his
wife
stood
still
her
face
was
beautiful
so
you
leaving
now
was
all
she
said
brede
porter
came
out
with
his
luggage
he
had
stayed
at
the
farm
for
these
three
days
in
order
to
be
at
hand
then
the
manufacturer
walked
down
through
the
field
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
children
i
do
know
this
man
with
his
good
humor
and
kindliness
and
money
and
everything
fond
of
his
children
all
in
all
to
his
wife
was
he
really
everything
to
his
wife
the
first
evening
he
wasted
time
on
a
party
and
every
night
he
wasted
time
in
snoring
and
so
the
three
days
and
nights
went
by
xix
it
is
very
pleasant
here
at
harvest
time
scythes
are
being
sharpened
in
the
field
men
and
women
are
at
work
they
go
thinly
clad
and
bareheaded
and
call
to
one
another
and
laugh
sometimes
they
drink
from
a
bucket
of
whey
then
set
to
work
again
there
is
the
familiar
fragrance
of
hay
which
penetrates
my
senses
like
a
song
of
home
drawing
me
home
home
though
i
am
not
abroad
but
perhaps
i
am
abroad
after
all
far
away
from
the
soil
where
i
have
my
roots
why
indeed
do
i
stay
here
any
longer
at
a
resort
full
of
schoolmistresses
with
a
host
who
has
once
more
said
farewell
to
sobriety
nothing
is
happening
to
me
i
do
not
grow
here
the
others
go
out
and
lie
on
their
backs
i
steal
off
and
find
relish
in
myself
and
feel
poetry
within
me
for
the
night
the
world
wants
no
poetry
it
wants
only
verses
that
have
not
been
sung
before
and
norway
wants
no
irons
only
village
smiths
forge
irons
now
for
the
needs
of
the
mob
and
the
honor
of
the
country
no
one
came
the
stream
of
tourists
went
up
and
down
stordalen
and
left
our
little
reisa
valley
deserted
if
only
the
northern
railway
could
have
come
to
reisa
with
cook
and
bennett
tours
then
stordalen
in
its
turn
would
have
lain
deserted
meanwhile
the
cotters
who
are
cultivating
the
soil
will
probably
go
on
harvesting
half
the
crop
of
the
outlying
fields
for
the
rest
of
time
there
is
every
reason
to
think
so
unless
our
descendants
are
more
intelligent
than
we
and
refuse
to
be
smitten
with
the
demoralizing
effects
of
the
tourist
traffic
now
my
friend
you
must
believe
me
this
is
the
point
where
you
must
shake
your
head
there
is
a
professor
scuttling
about
the
country
a
born
mediocrity
with
a
little
school
knowledge
about
history
you
had
better
ask
him
he
give
you
just
as
much
mediocre
information
my
friend
as
your
vision
can
grasp
and
your
brain
endure
hardly
had
manufacturer
brede
left
when
paul
began
to
live
a
most
irregular
life
again
more
and
more
all
roads
were
closed
to
him
he
saw
no
way
out
and
therefore
preferred
to
make
himself
blind
which
gave
him
an
excuse
for
not
seeing
seven
of
our
permanent
guests
now
left
together
the
telephone
operators
tradesman
batt
schoolmistresses
johnsen
and
palm
and
two
men
who
were
in
some
sort
of
business
i
do
quite
know
what
this
whole
party
went
across
the
fjeld
to
stordalen
to
be
driven
about
in
cars
cases
of
various
kinds
of
foodstuffs
arrived
for
paul
they
were
carried
up
one
evening
by
a
man
from
the
village
he
had
to
make
several
journeys
with
the
side
of
his
cart
let
down
and
bring
the
cases
over
the
roughest
spots
one
by
one
that
was
the
kind
of
road
it
was
josephine
received
the
consignment
and
noticed
that
one
of
the
cases
gave
forth
the
sound
of
a
liquid
splashing
inside
that
had
come
to
the
wrong
place
she
said
and
writing
another
address
on
it
she
told
the
man
to
take
it
back
it
was
sirup
that
had
come
too
late
she
said
she
had
got
sirup
elsewhere
in
the
meantime
later
in
the
evening
we
heard
them
discussing
it
in
the
kitchen
the
sirup
had
not
come
too
late
paul
said
angrily
and
i
told
you
to
clear
these
newspapers
away
he
cried
we
heard
the
sound
of
paper
and
glass
being
swept
to
the
floor
well
things
were
not
too
easy
for
paul
the
days
went
by
dull
and
empty
nor
had
he
any
children
to
give
him
pleasant
thoughts
at
times
though
he
wanted
to
build
still
more
houses
he
could
not
use
half
those
he
had
already
there
was
brede
living
alone
with
her
children
in
one
of
them
and
since
seven
of
the
guests
had
left
miss
torsen
was
also
alone
in
the
south
wing
paul
wanted
at
all
costs
to
build
roads
and
share
in
the
development
of
the
tourist
traffic
he
even
wanted
to
run
a
fleet
of
motor
cars
but
since
he
had
not
the
power
to
do
this
alone
and
could
get
no
assistance
nothing
was
left
him
but
to
resign
himself
and
now
to
make
matters
worse
manufacturer
brede
had
said
he
would
withdraw
his
money
paul
careworn
face
looked
out
of
the
kitchen
door
before
going
out
himself
he
wanted
to
make
sure
there
was
no
one
about
but
he
was
disappointed
in
this
for
the
lawyer
at
once
greeted
him
loudly
good
evening
paul
and
drew
him
outside
they
strolled
down
the
field
in
the
dusk
assuredly
there
is
little
to
be
gained
by
having
a
good
talk
with
a
man
about
his
drinking
such
matters
are
too
vital
to
be
settled
by
talking
but
paul
seems
to
have
admitted
that
the
lawyer
was
right
in
all
he
said
and
probably
left
him
with
good
resolutions
paul
went
down
to
the
village
again
he
was
going
to
the
post
office
the
money
he
had
from
the
seven
departed
guests
would
be
scattered
to
all
quarters
of
the
globe
and
yet
it
was
not
enough
to
cover
everything
in
fact
not
enough
for
anything
for
interest
repayments
taxes
and
repairs
it
paid
only
for
a
few
cases
of
food
from
the
city
and
of
course
he
stopped
the
case
of
sirup
from
going
back
paul
returned
because
he
no
longer
wished
to
see
it
was
the
same
thing
all
over
again
but
his
brain
seemed
in
its
own
way
to
go
on
searching
for
a
solution
and
one
day
he
asked
the
lawyer
what
do
you
call
those
square
glass
jars
for
keeping
small
fish
in
goldfish
do
you
mean
an
aquarium
that
it
said
paul
are
they
dear
i
do
know
why
i
wonder
if
i
could
get
one
what
do
you
want
it
for
do
you
think
it
might
attract
people
to
the
place
oh
well
perhaps
it
would
and
paul
withdrew
madder
than
ever
some
people
see
flies
paul
saw
goldfish
xx
the
lawyer
is
constantly
in
miss
torsen
company
he
even
swings
her
in
the
children
swing
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
to
steady
her
when
the
swing
stops
solem
watches
all
this
from
the
field
where
he
is
working
and
begins
to
sing
a
ribald
song
certainly
these
two
have
so
him
that
if
he
is
going
to
sing
improper
songs
in
this
is
the
time
to
do
it
no
one
will
gainsay
that
so
he
sang
his
song
very
loud
and
then
began
to
yodel
but
miss
torsen
went
on
swinging
and
the
lawyer
went
on
putting
his
arm
round
her
and
stopping
her
it
was
a
saturday
evening
i
stood
talking
to
the
lawyer
in
the
garden
he
did
like
the
place
and
wanted
to
leave
but
miss
torsen
would
not
go
with
him
and
going
alone
was
such
a
bore
he
did
not
conceal
that
the
young
woman
meant
something
to
him
solem
approached
and
lifted
his
cap
in
greeting
then
he
looked
round
quickly
and
began
to
talk
to
the
lawyer
politely
as
became
his
position
of
a
servant
the
danish
gentleman
is
going
to
climb
the
peak
tomorrow
i
to
take
a
rope
and
go
with
him
the
lawyer
was
startled
is
he
the
blankness
of
the
lawyer
face
was
a
remarkable
sight
his
small
athletic
brain
failed
him
a
moment
passed
in
silence
yes
early
tomorrow
morning
said
solem
i
thought
i
tell
you
because
after
all
it
was
your
idea
first
yes
so
it
was
said
the
lawyer
you
quite
right
but
now
he
be
ahead
of
me
solem
knew
how
to
get
round
that
no
i
did
promise
to
go
he
said
i
told
him
i
had
to
go
to
the
village
tomorrow
but
we
ca
deceive
him
i
do
want
to
do
that
pity
said
solem
everybody
says
the
first
one
to
climb
the
blue
peak
will
be
in
all
the
papers
he
take
offense
the
lawyer
murmured
considering
the
matter
but
solem
urged
him
on
i
do
think
so
anyhow
you
were
the
first
one
to
talk
about
it
everybody
here
will
know
and
i
be
prevented
said
the
lawyer
we
can
go
at
dawn
said
solem
in
the
end
they
came
to
an
agreement
you
wo
tell
anyone
the
lawyer
said
to
me
the
lawyer
was
missed
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
was
not
in
his
room
and
not
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
danish
mountaineer
can
tell
us
where
he
is
i
said
but
it
transpired
that
the
dane
had
not
even
thought
of
climbing
the
blue
peak
that
day
and
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
expedition
this
surprised
me
greatly
i
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
eleven
i
had
been
watching
the
peak
through
my
field
glasses
from
the
moment
i
got
up
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
it
was
five
hours
since
the
two
men
had
left
at
eleven
solem
came
running
back
he
was
drenched
in
sweat
and
exhausted
come
and
help
us
he
called
excitedly
to
the
group
of
guests
what
happened
somebody
asked
he
fell
off
how
tired
solem
was
and
drenched
to
the
skin
but
what
could
we
do
rush
up
the
mountainside
and
look
at
the
accident
too
ca
he
walk
somebody
asked
no
he
dead
said
solem
looking
from
one
to
another
of
us
as
though
to
read
in
our
faces
whether
his
message
seemed
credible
he
fell
off
he
did
want
me
to
help
him
a
few
more
questions
and
answers
josephine
was
already
halfway
across
the
field
she
was
going
to
the
village
to
telephone
for
the
doctor
we
shall
have
to
get
him
down
said
the
danish
mountaineer
so
he
and
i
improvised
a
stretcher
solem
was
instructed
to
take
brandy
and
bandages
to
the
site
of
the
accident
and
the
bergensians
the
associate
master
miss
torsen
and
molie
went
with
him
did
you
really
say
nothing
to
solem
about
climbing
the
peak
today
i
asked
the
dane
no
he
replied
i
never
said
a
word
about
it
if
i
had
meant
to
go
i
should
certainly
not
have
wanted
company
later
that
afternoon
we
returned
with
the
lawyer
on
the
stretcher
solem
kept
explaining
all
the
way
home
how
the
accident
had
happened
what
he
had
said
and
what
the
lawyer
had
said
pointing
to
objects
on
the
way
as
though
this
stone
represented
the
lawyer
and
that
the
abyss
into
which
he
had
plunged
solem
still
carried
the
rope
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
use
miss
torsen
asked
no
more
than
anyone
else
and
made
purely
conventional
comments
i
advised
him
against
it
i
begged
him
not
to
go
but
however
much
we
talked
we
could
not
bring
the
lawyer
back
to
life
strange
his
watch
was
still
going
but
he
himself
was
dead
the
doctor
could
do
nothing
here
and
returned
to
his
village
there
followed
a
depressing
evening
solem
went
to
the
village
to
send
a
telegram
to
the
lawyer
family
and
the
rest
of
us
did
what
we
thought
decent
under
the
circumstances
we
all
sat
in
the
living
room
with
books
in
our
hands
now
and
again
some
reference
would
be
made
to
the
accident
it
was
a
reminder
we
said
how
small
we
mortals
were
and
the
associate
master
who
had
not
the
soul
of
a
tourist
greatly
feared
that
this
disaster
would
injure
the
resort
and
make
things
still
more
difficult
for
paul
people
would
shun
a
place
where
they
were
likely
to
fall
off
and
be
killed
no
the
associate
master
was
no
tourist
and
did
not
understand
the
mind
paul
himself
seemed
to
sense
that
the
accident
might
benefit
him
rather
than
do
him
harm
he
brought
out
a
bottle
of
brandy
to
console
us
on
this
mournful
evening
and
since
it
was
a
death
to
which
we
owed
this
attention
one
of
the
men
from
bergen
made
a
speech
xxi
the
accident
became
widely
known
newspapermen
came
from
the
city
and
solem
had
to
pilot
them
up
the
mountain
and
show
them
the
spot
where
it
had
taken
place
if
the
body
had
not
been
removed
at
once
they
would
have
written
about
that
too
children
and
ignoramuses
might
be
inclined
to
think
it
foolish
that
solem
should
be
taken
from
the
work
in
the
fields
at
harvest
time
but
must
not
the
business
of
the
tourist
resort
go
before
all
else
solem
tourists
someone
called
to
him
and
solem
left
his
work
a
flock
of
reporters
surrounded
him
asked
him
questions
made
him
take
them
to
the
mountains
to
the
river
a
phrase
was
coined
at
the
farm
for
absences
solem
with
death
but
solem
was
by
no
means
with
death
on
the
contrary
he
was
in
the
very
midst
of
life
enjoying
himself
thriving
once
again
he
was
an
important
personage
listened
to
by
strangers
doling
out
information
nor
did
his
audience
now
consist
of
ladies
only
indeed
no
this
was
something
new
a
change
these
were
keen
alert
gentlemen
from
the
city
to
me
solem
said
funny
the
accident
should
have
happened
just
when
the
scratch
on
my
nail
has
grown
out
is
it
he
showed
me
his
thumbnail
there
was
no
mark
on
it
the
newspaper
reporters
wrote
articles
and
sent
telegrams
not
only
about
the
blue
peak
and
the
dreadful
death
but
about
the
locality
and
about
the
tore
peak
resort
that
haven
for
the
weary
with
its
wonderful
buildings
set
like
jewels
in
the
mountains
what
a
surprise
to
come
here
gargoyles
living
room
piano
all
the
latest
books
timber
outside
ready
for
new
jewels
in
their
setting
altogether
a
magnificent
picture
of
norway
modern
farming
yes
indeed
the
newspapermen
appreciated
it
and
they
did
their
advertising
the
english
arrived
where
is
solem
they
asked
and
where
is
the
blue
peak
they
asked
we
ought
to
get
the
hay
in
said
josephine
and
the
wife
at
the
farm
there
be
rain
and
fifty
cartloads
are
still
out
that
was
all
very
well
but
where
is
solem
asked
the
english
so
solem
had
to
go
with
them
the
two
casual
laborers
began
to
cart
away
the
hay
but
then
the
women
had
no
one
to
help
them
rake
confusion
was
rife
everyone
rushed
wildly
hither
and
thither
because
there
was
no
one
to
lead
them
the
weather
stayed
fine
overnight
it
was
patient
weather
as
soon
as
the
dew
dried
up
more
hay
would
be
brought
in
perhaps
all
the
hay
oh
we
should
manage
all
right
more
english
appeared
and
solem
the
blue
peak
they
said
their
perverse
sportsmen
brains
tingled
and
thrilled
they
had
successfully
eluded
all
the
resorts
on
the
way
and
arrived
here
without
being
caught
there
was
the
blue
peak
like
a
mast
against
the
sky
they
hurried
up
so
fast
that
solem
was
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
with
them
they
would
have
felt
for
ever
disgraced
if
they
had
neglected
to
stand
on
this
admirable
site
of
a
disaster
this
most
excellent
abyss
some
said
it
would
be
a
lifelong
source
of
regret
to
them
if
they
did
not
climb
the
blue
peak
forthwith
others
had
no
desire
but
to
gloat
over
the
lawyer
death
fall
and
to
shout
down
the
abyss
gaping
at
the
echo
and
advancing
so
far
out
on
the
ledge
that
they
stood
with
their
toes
on
death
but
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
good
to
none
and
the
resort
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
paul
began
to
revive
again
and
the
furrows
in
his
face
were
smoothed
out
a
man
of
worth
grows
strong
and
active
with
good
fortune
in
adversity
he
is
defiant
one
who
is
not
defiant
in
adversity
is
worth
nothing
let
him
be
destroyed
paul
stopped
drinking
he
even
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
harvesting
and
worked
in
the
field
in
solem
place
if
only
he
had
begun
when
the
weather
was
still
slow
and
patient
but
at
least
paul
began
to
tackle
things
in
the
right
spirit
again
he
only
regretted
that
he
had
set
aside
for
the
cotters
those
outlying
fields
from
which
they
were
used
to
getting
half
the
hay
this
year
he
would
have
liked
to
keep
it
himself
but
he
had
given
his
word
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
besides
it
was
raining
now
haymaking
had
to
stop
they
could
not
even
stack
what
had
already
been
gathered
outside
three
cartloads
of
fodder
were
going
to
waste
before
long
the
novelty
of
the
tore
peak
resort
wore
off
again
the
newspapermen
wrote
and
sent
telegrams
about
other
gratifying
misfortunes
the
death
on
the
blue
peak
having
lost
its
news
value
it
had
been
an
intoxication
now
came
the
morning
after
the
danish
mountaineer
quite
simply
deserted
he
strapped
on
his
knapsack
and
walked
across
the
field
like
one
of
the
villagers
caring
no
more
for
the
blue
peak
the
commotion
he
had
witnessed
in
the
last
week
had
taught
him
a
lesson
and
the
tourists
swarmed
on
to
other
places
what
harm
have
i
done
them
paul
probably
thought
that
they
should
be
going
again
have
i
been
too
much
in
the
fields
and
too
little
with
them
but
i
greeted
them
humbly
and
took
my
man
out
of
the
harvesting
work
to
help
them
then
two
young
men
arrived
sprouts
off
the
norwegian
tree
sportsmen
to
their
finger
tips
who
talked
of
nothing
but
sailing
cycling
and
football
they
were
going
to
be
civil
engineers
the
young
norway
they
too
wanted
to
see
the
blue
peak
to
the
best
of
their
ability
after
all
one
must
keep
pace
with
modern
life
but
they
were
so
young
that
when
they
looked
up
at
the
peak
they
were
afraid
solem
had
learned
more
than
one
trick
in
tourist
company
craftily
he
led
them
on
and
then
extorted
money
from
them
in
return
for
a
promise
not
to
expose
their
foolishness
so
all
was
well
the
young
sprouts
came
down
the
mountain
again
bragging
and
showing
off
their
sportsmanship
one
of
them
brought
down
a
bloodstained
rag
which
he
flung
on
the
ground
saying
there
what
left
of
your
lawyer
that
fell
off
ha
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
other
sprout
yes
truly
they
had
acquired
dashing
ways
among
their
sporting
acquaintances
it
rained
for
three
weeks
then
came
two
fine
days
and
then
rain
again
for
a
fortnight
the
sun
was
not
to
be
seen
the
sky
was
invisible
the
mountain
tops
had
disappeared
we
saw
nothing
but
rain
the
roofs
at
the
tore
peak
resort
began
to
leak
more
and
more
the
hay
that
still
lay
spread
on
the
ground
was
black
and
rotting
and
the
stacks
had
gone
moldy
the
cotters
had
got
their
hay
indoors
during
the
patient
spell
they
had
carried
it
man
woman
and
child
on
their
backs
the
men
from
bergen
and
brede
with
her
children
have
left
for
home
the
little
girls
curtsied
and
thanked
me
for
taking
them
walking
in
the
hills
and
telling
them
stories
the
house
is
empty
now
associate
master
höy
and
molie
were
the
last
to
go
they
left
last
week
traveling
separately
though
both
were
going
to
the
same
small
town
he
went
by
way
of
the
village
a
very
roundabout
route
while
she
crossed
the
field
it
is
very
quiet
now
but
miss
torsen
is
still
here
why
do
i
not
leave
do
know
why
ask
i
here
have
you
ever
heard
anyone
ask
how
much
is
a
northern
light
hold
your
tongue
where
should
i
go
if
i
did
leave
do
you
imagine
i
want
to
go
to
the
town
again
or
do
you
think
i
longing
for
my
old
hut
and
the
winter
and
madame
i
not
longing
for
any
specific
place
i
am
simply
longing
of
course
i
ought
to
be
old
enough
to
understand
what
all
sensible
norwegians
know
that
our
country
is
once
more
on
the
right
road
the
papers
are
all
writing
about
the
splendid
progress
the
tourist
traffic
has
made
in
stordalen
since
the
motor
road
was
opened
ought
i
not
to
go
there
and
feel
gratified
from
old
habit
i
still
take
an
interest
in
the
few
of
us
who
are
left
miss
torsen
is
still
here
miss
torsen
what
more
is
there
to
be
said
about
her
well
she
does
not
leave
she
stays
here
to
complete
the
picture
of
the
woman
torsen
child
of
the
middle
class
who
has
read
schoolbooks
all
through
her
formative
years
who
has
learned
all
about
but
undernourished
her
soul
that
is
what
she
is
doing
here
i
remember
a
few
weeks
ago
when
we
were
infested
with
englishmen
a
young
sprout
coming
down
from
the
mountain
top
with
a
bloodstained
rag
which
he
threw
on
the
ground
saying
here
what
left
of
your
lawyer
that
fell
off
miss
torsen
heard
it
and
never
moved
a
muscle
no
she
never
mourned
the
death
of
the
lawyer
very
keenly
on
the
contrary
she
wrote
off
at
once
to
ask
another
friend
to
come
when
he
came
he
turned
out
to
be
a
swaggering
scatterbrain
a
free
lance
he
called
himself
in
the
visitors
book
i
have
not
mentioned
him
before
because
he
was
less
important
than
she
less
important
in
fact
than
any
of
us
he
was
beardless
and
wore
his
collar
open
heaven
knows
if
he
was
employed
at
a
theater
or
in
the
films
miss
torsen
went
to
meet
him
when
he
came
and
said
welcome
to
our
mountains
and
thanks
for
coming
so
evidently
she
had
sent
for
him
but
why
did
she
not
leave
why
did
she
seem
to
strike
root
in
the
place
and
even
ask
others
to
come
here
yet
she
had
been
the
first
to
want
to
leave
last
summer
there
was
something
behind
this
xxii
i
muse
on
all
this
and
understand
that
her
staying
here
is
somehow
connected
with
her
carnal
desires
with
the
fact
that
solem
is
still
here
how
muddled
it
all
is
and
how
this
handsome
girl
has
been
spoiled
i
saw
her
not
long
ago
tall
and
proud
upright
untouched
walking
intentionally
close
to
solem
yet
not
replying
to
his
greeting
did
she
suspect
him
of
complicity
in
the
death
of
the
lawyer
and
avoid
him
for
that
reason
not
in
the
least
she
avoided
him
less
than
before
even
letting
him
take
her
letters
to
the
post
office
which
she
had
not
done
previously
but
she
was
unbalanced
a
poor
thing
that
had
lost
her
bearings
whenever
she
could
she
secretly
defiled
herself
with
pitch
with
dung
she
sniffed
at
foulness
and
was
not
repelled
one
day
when
solem
swore
a
needlessly
strong
oath
at
a
horse
that
was
restless
she
looked
at
him
shivered
and
went
a
deep
red
but
she
mastered
herself
at
once
and
asked
josephine
is
that
man
leaving
soon
yes
josephine
replied
in
a
few
days
though
she
had
seized
this
opportunity
to
ask
her
question
with
a
great
show
of
indifference
i
am
certain
it
was
an
important
one
to
her
she
went
away
in
silence
yes
miss
torsen
stayed
for
she
was
sexually
bound
to
solem
despair
solem
rough
passion
that
she
herself
had
inflamed
his
brutality
his
masculinity
his
greedy
hands
his
looks
she
sniffed
at
all
this
and
was
excited
by
it
she
had
grown
so
unnatural
that
her
sexual
needs
were
satisfied
by
keeping
this
man
at
a
distance
the
torsen
type
no
doubt
lies
in
her
solitary
bed
at
night
reveling
in
the
sensation
that
in
another
house
a
man
lies
writhing
for
her
but
her
friend
the
actor
he
was
in
no
sense
the
other
equal
there
was
nothing
of
the
bull
in
him
nothing
of
action
only
the
braggadocio
of
the
theater
here
am
i
growing
small
and
petty
with
this
life
i
question
solem
about
the
accident
we
are
alone
together
in
the
woodshed
why
had
he
lied
and
said
the
dane
wanted
to
climb
the
blue
peak
that
unfortunate
sunday
morning
solem
looked
at
me
pretending
not
to
understand
i
repeated
my
question
solem
denied
he
had
said
any
such
thing
i
heard
you
i
said
no
you
did
he
said
a
pause
suddenly
he
dropped
to
the
floor
of
the
shed
convulsed
without
shape
an
outline
merely
a
few
minutes
passed
before
he
got
up
again
when
he
was
on
his
feet
once
more
pulling
his
clothes
to
rights
we
looked
at
each
other
i
had
no
wish
to
speak
to
him
further
and
left
him
besides
he
was
going
away
soon
after
this
everything
was
dull
and
empty
again
i
went
out
alone
aping
myself
and
shouting
bricks
for
the
palace
the
calf
is
much
stronger
today
and
when
this
was
done
i
did
other
nothings
and
when
my
money
began
to
run
out
i
wrote
to
my
publisher
pretending
i
would
soon
send
him
an
unbelievably
remarkable
manuscript
in
short
i
behaved
like
a
man
in
love
these
were
the
typical
symptoms
and
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
no
doubt
you
suspect
me
of
dwelling
on
the
subject
of
miss
torsen
out
of
in
that
case
i
must
have
concealed
well
in
these
pages
that
i
never
think
of
her
except
as
an
object
as
a
theme
turn
back
the
pages
and
you
will
see
at
my
age
one
does
not
fall
in
love
without
becoming
grotesque
without
making
even
the
pharaohs
laugh
but
there
is
one
thing
i
can
not
finish
doing
and
that
is
withdrawing
to
my
room
and
sitting
alone
with
the
good
darkness
round
me
this
after
all
is
the
last
pleasure
an
interlude
miss
torsen
and
her
actor
are
walking
this
way
i
hear
their
footsteps
and
their
voices
but
since
i
am
sitting
in
the
dark
of
the
evening
i
can
not
see
them
they
stop
outside
my
open
window
leaning
against
it
and
the
actor
says
something
asks
her
to
do
something
she
does
not
want
to
do
tries
to
draw
her
with
him
but
she
resists
then
he
grows
angry
what
the
devil
did
you
send
for
me
for
he
asks
roughly
and
she
begins
to
weep
and
says
so
that
all
you
come
for
oh
oh
but
i
not
like
that
at
all
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
i
not
hurting
you
am
i
one
who
understands
women
vain
boasting
i
made
my
presence
known
then
because
her
weeping
sounded
so
wretched
i
moved
a
chair
and
cleared
my
throat
the
sound
caught
his
attention
at
once
and
he
hushed
her
trying
to
listen
but
she
said
no
it
was
nothing
but
she
knew
very
well
this
was
not
true
she
knew
what
the
sound
was
it
was
not
the
first
time
miss
torsen
used
this
trick
with
me
she
had
often
pretended
that
she
thought
i
was
not
within
hearing
and
then
created
some
such
delicate
situation
each
time
i
had
promised
myself
not
to
intervene
but
she
had
not
wept
before
now
she
wept
why
did
she
use
these
wiles
to
clear
herself
in
my
eyes
mine
the
eyes
of
a
settled
man
to
make
me
believe
how
good
she
was
how
but
dear
child
i
knew
that
before
i
could
see
it
from
your
hands
you
are
so
unnatural
that
in
your
seven
and
twentieth
year
you
walk
unmarried
barren
and
unopen
the
pair
drifted
away
and
there
is
something
else
i
can
not
finish
doing
withdrawing
into
solitude
in
the
woods
alone
with
the
good
darkness
round
me
this
is
the
last
pleasure
one
needs
solitude
and
darkness
not
because
one
flees
the
company
of
others
and
can
endure
only
one
own
but
because
of
their
quality
of
loftiness
and
religion
strange
how
all
things
pass
distantly
yet
all
is
near
we
sit
in
an
omnipresence
it
must
be
god
it
must
be
ourselves
as
a
part
of
all
things
what
would
my
heart
where
would
i
stray
shall
i
leave
the
forest
behind
me
it
was
my
home
but
yesterday
now
toward
the
city
i
wend
my
way
to
the
darkness
of
night
i
resigned
me
the
world
round
me
sleeps
as
i
tarry
alone
soothing
my
ear
with
its
quiet
how
large
and
gray
is
the
city
of
stone
in
which
the
many
all
hopes
enthrone
shall
i
too
accept
their
fiat
hark
do
the
bells
ring
on
the
hillside
back
to
the
peace
of
the
forest
i
turn
in
the
nightly
hour
that
hoarest
there
a
hedgerow
to
which
i
yearn
i
shall
rest
my
head
on
heather
and
fern
and
sleep
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
hark
how
the
bells
ring
on
the
hillside
romantic
yes
mere
sentimentality
mood
rhyme
nothing
yes
it
is
the
last
happiness
xxiii
the
sun
has
returned
not
darkly
glowing
and
regal
more
than
that
imperial
because
it
is
flaming
this
you
do
not
understand
my
friend
whatever
the
language
in
which
it
is
dished
up
for
you
but
i
say
there
is
an
imperial
sun
in
the
sky
it
a
good
day
for
going
to
the
woods
it
is
sweeping
time
for
the
woods
are
full
of
yellow
things
that
have
come
suddenly
into
being
a
short
time
ago
they
were
not
there
or
i
did
not
see
them
or
they
had
the
own
complexion
there
is
something
unborn
about
them
like
embryos
in
an
early
stage
but
if
i
whirl
them
about
they
are
miracles
of
fulfillment
here
are
fungi
of
every
sort
mushrooms
and
puffballs
how
close
is
the
poisonous
mushroom
to
the
happy
family
of
the
edible
mushroom
and
how
innocently
it
stands
there
yet
it
is
deadly
what
magnificent
cunning
a
spurious
fruit
a
criminal
habitual
vice
itself
but
preening
in
splendor
and
brilliance
a
very
cardinal
of
fungi
i
break
off
a
morsel
to
chew
it
is
good
and
soft
on
the
tongue
but
i
am
a
coward
and
spit
it
out
again
was
it
not
the
poisonous
mushroom
that
drove
men
berserker
but
in
the
dawn
of
our
own
day
we
die
of
a
hair
in
the
throat
the
sun
is
already
setting
far
up
the
mountainside
are
the
cattle
but
they
are
moving
homeward
now
i
can
hear
by
their
bells
that
they
are
moving
tinkling
bells
and
bells
sometimes
sounding
together
as
though
there
were
a
meaning
in
it
a
pattern
of
tones
a
rapture
and
rapture
too
to
see
all
the
blades
of
grass
and
the
tiny
flowers
and
plants
beside
me
where
i
lie
is
a
small
pod
plant
wonderfully
meek
with
tiny
seeds
pushing
out
of
the
pod
god
bless
it
it
becoming
a
mother
it
has
got
caught
in
a
dry
twig
and
i
liberate
it
life
quivers
within
it
the
sun
has
warmed
it
today
and
called
it
to
its
destiny
a
tiny
gigantic
miracle
now
it
is
sunset
and
the
woods
bend
under
a
rustling
that
passes
through
them
sweet
and
heavy
it
is
the
evening
i
lie
for
another
hour
or
two
the
birds
have
long
since
gone
to
rest
and
darkness
falls
thick
and
soft
as
i
walk
homeward
my
feet
feel
their
way
and
i
hold
my
hands
before
me
till
i
reach
the
field
where
it
is
a
little
lighter
i
walk
on
the
hay
that
has
been
left
outdoors
it
is
tough
and
black
and
i
slip
on
it
because
it
is
already
rotting
as
i
approach
the
houses
bats
fly
noiselessly
past
me
as
though
on
wings
of
foam
a
slight
shudder
convulses
me
whenever
they
pass
suddenly
i
stop
a
man
is
walking
here
i
can
see
him
against
the
wall
of
the
new
house
he
has
on
a
coat
that
looks
like
the
actor
raincoat
but
it
is
not
the
little
comedian
himself
there
he
goes
into
the
house
right
into
the
house
it
is
solem
why
that
where
she
sleeps
i
think
ah
well
alone
in
the
building
in
the
south
wing
miss
torsen
alone
yes
quite
alone
and
solem
has
just
gone
in
i
stand
there
waiting
to
be
at
hand
to
rush
in
to
the
rescue
for
after
all
i
am
a
human
being
not
a
brute
several
minutes
pass
he
has
not
even
bothered
to
be
very
quiet
for
i
hear
him
clicking
the
key
in
the
lock
surely
i
ought
to
hear
a
cry
now
i
hear
nothing
nothing
a
chair
scraping
across
the
floor
that
is
all
but
good
heavens
he
may
do
her
some
harm
he
may
injure
her
he
may
overpower
her
with
rape
ought
i
not
to
tap
on
the
window
i
what
for
but
at
the
very
first
cry
i
shall
be
on
the
spot
take
my
word
for
it
not
a
single
cry
the
hours
pass
i
have
settled
down
to
wait
of
course
i
can
not
go
my
way
and
desert
a
helpless
woman
but
the
hours
wear
on
a
very
thorough
business
in
there
nothing
niggardly
about
this
it
is
almost
dawn
it
occurs
to
me
that
he
may
be
killing
her
perhaps
has
killed
her
already
i
am
alarmed
and
about
to
get
up
when
the
key
clicks
in
the
lock
again
and
solem
emerges
he
does
not
run
but
walks
back
the
way
he
came
down
to
the
veranda
of
my
own
house
there
he
hangs
the
actor
raincoat
where
it
hung
before
and
emerges
again
but
this
time
he
is
naked
he
has
been
naked
under
the
coat
all
this
time
is
it
possible
why
not
no
inhibitions
no
restraint
no
covering
solem
has
thought
it
all
out
now
stark
naked
he
stalks
to
his
room
what
a
man
i
sit
thinking
and
collecting
myself
and
regaining
my
wits
what
has
happened
the
south
wing
is
still
wrapped
in
silence
but
the
lady
is
not
dead
i
can
see
that
from
solem
fearless
manner
as
he
goes
to
his
room
lights
the
lamp
and
goes
to
bed
it
relieves
me
to
know
she
is
alive
revives
me
and
makes
me
superlatively
brave
if
he
has
dared
to
kill
her
i
will
report
it
at
once
i
shall
not
spare
him
i
shall
accuse
him
of
both
her
death
and
the
lawyer
i
shall
go
further
i
shall
accuse
others
the
thief
of
last
winter
the
man
that
stole
the
sides
of
bacon
from
a
tradesman
and
sold
me
rolls
of
tobacco
out
of
his
bag
no
i
shall
not
keep
silence
about
anything
then
xxiv
when
it
grew
light
solem
went
to
the
kitchen
had
his
breakfast
settled
his
business
with
paul
and
the
women
and
returned
to
his
room
he
was
in
no
hurry
though
it
was
no
longer
early
in
the
day
he
took
his
time
about
tying
his
bundles
preparatory
to
leaving
lingeringly
he
looked
into
the
windows
of
the
south
wing
as
he
passed
then
solem
was
gone
a
little
later
miss
torsen
came
in
to
breakfast
she
asked
at
once
about
solem
and
why
might
she
be
so
interested
in
solem
she
had
certainly
stopped
in
her
room
intentionally
so
as
to
give
him
time
to
leave
if
she
wanted
to
see
him
she
could
have
been
here
long
ago
but
was
it
not
safest
to
seem
a
little
angry
supposing
night
owl
that
i
was
that
i
had
seen
something
where
is
solem
she
asked
indignantly
solem
has
gone
now
josephine
replied
lucky
for
him
why
asked
josephine
oh
he
a
dreadful
creature
how
agitated
she
was
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
calmed
down
her
anger
dissolved
and
there
was
neither
weeping
nor
a
scene
only
she
did
not
walk
proudly
as
was
her
habit
but
preferred
to
sit
in
silence
that
passed
too
she
roused
herself
briskly
soon
after
solem
departure
and
in
a
few
days
she
was
the
same
as
ever
she
took
walks
she
talked
and
laughed
with
us
she
made
the
actor
swing
her
in
the
children
swing
as
in
the
lawyer
day
i
went
out
one
evening
for
there
was
good
weather
and
darkness
for
walking
there
was
neither
a
moon
nor
stars
the
gentle
ripple
of
the
little
reisa
river
was
all
the
sound
i
heard
there
were
god
and
goethe
and
allen
gipfeln
ist
that
night
on
my
return
i
was
in
the
mood
to
walk
softly
and
on
tiptoe
so
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
then
they
came
again
to
my
window
those
two
lunatics
the
lady
and
the
actor
what
next
but
it
was
not
he
that
chose
this
spot
of
that
i
was
sure
she
chose
it
because
she
was
convinced
i
had
returned
there
was
something
she
me
to
hear
why
should
i
listen
to
him
still
pleading
with
her
i
had
enough
of
this
he
said
i
leaving
tomorrow
oh
well
she
said
no
let
not
tonight
she
added
suddenly
some
other
time
yes
in
a
few
days
we
talk
about
it
tomorrow
good
night
for
the
first
time
it
struck
me
she
wants
to
rouse
you
too
settled
man
though
you
are
she
wants
to
make
you
as
mad
as
the
others
that
what
she
after
and
now
i
remember
before
the
lawyer
arrived
when
there
was
tradesman
batt
i
remember
how
during
his
first
few
days
here
she
would
give
me
a
kind
word
or
a
look
that
was
quite
out
of
the
picture
and
as
unmistakable
as
her
pride
would
permit
no
she
had
no
objections
to
seeing
old
age
wriggle
and
listen
to
this
before
this
she
had
been
intent
to
show
a
indifference
to
sex
but
that
was
finished
was
she
not
at
this
moment
resisting
only
faintly
and
raising
definite
hopes
not
tonight
but
some
other
time
she
had
said
yes
a
a
mere
postponement
that
i
was
meant
to
hear
she
was
corrupt
but
she
was
also
cunning
with
the
cunning
of
a
madman
so
corrupt
dear
child
pharaoh
laughs
before
his
pyramids
standing
before
his
pyramids
he
laughs
he
would
laugh
at
me
too
next
day
we
three
remaining
guests
were
sitting
in
the
living
room
the
lady
and
the
actor
read
one
book
i
read
another
will
you
she
says
to
him
do
me
a
great
favor
with
pleasure
would
you
go
out
in
the
grounds
where
we
sat
yesterday
and
fetch
my
galoshes
so
he
went
out
to
do
her
this
great
favor
he
sang
a
popular
song
as
he
crossed
the
yard
cheerful
in
his
own
peculiar
way
she
turned
to
me
you
seem
silent
do
i
yes
you
very
silent
listen
to
this
i
said
and
began
to
read
to
her
from
the
book
i
held
in
my
hands
i
read
a
longish
bit
she
tried
to
interrupt
me
several
times
and
at
length
said
impatiently
what
is
this
you
want
me
to
listen
to
the
you
must
admit
it
entertaining
i
read
it
she
said
and
then
she
began
to
clasp
her
hands
and
drag
them
apart
again
then
you
must
hear
something
you
have
read
before
i
replied
and
went
across
to
my
room
to
fetch
a
few
pages
i
had
written
they
were
only
a
few
poems
nothing
special
just
a
few
small
verses
not
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
reading
such
things
aloud
but
i
seized
on
this
for
the
moment
because
i
wanted
to
prevent
her
from
humbling
herself
and
telling
me
anything
more
while
i
was
reading
the
poems
to
her
the
actor
returned
i
could
find
any
galoshes
there
he
said
no
she
replied
absently
no
i
really
looked
everywhere
but
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
he
looked
after
her
in
some
surprise
and
sat
still
for
a
moment
then
it
occurred
to
him
i
believe
her
galoshes
are
in
the
passage
outside
her
door
he
said
and
hurried
after
her
i
sat
back
thinking
it
over
there
had
been
a
sweetness
in
her
face
as
she
said
yes
you
very
silent
had
she
seen
through
me
and
my
pretext
for
reading
to
her
of
course
she
had
she
was
no
fool
i
was
the
fool
nobody
else
i
should
have
driven
a
sportsman
to
despair
some
practice
the
sport
of
making
conquests
and
the
sport
of
making
love
because
they
find
it
so
agreeable
i
have
never
practiced
sport
of
any
kind
i
have
loved
and
raged
and
suffered
and
stormed
according
to
my
nature
that
is
all
i
am
an
man
and
here
i
sit
in
the
shadow
of
evening
the
shadow
of
the
let
me
have
done
the
actor
returned
to
the
living
room
confused
and
dejected
she
had
turned
him
out
she
had
wept
i
was
not
surprised
for
it
was
the
mode
of
expression
of
her
type
have
you
ever
heard
the
like
of
it
she
told
me
to
get
out
i
shall
leave
tomorrow
have
you
found
the
galoshes
i
asked
of
course
he
replied
they
were
right
in
the
passage
they
are
i
said
to
her
yes
she
said
under
your
nose
i
said
yes
go
away
she
said
and
began
to
cry
so
i
went
away
she
get
over
it
do
you
think
so
yes
i
expect
she
will
oh
well
it
my
opinion
nobody
can
understand
women
anyhow
but
they
a
mighty
sex
the
women
a
mighty
sex
they
certainly
are
he
sat
on
a
while
but
he
had
no
peace
of
mind
and
soon
went
out
again
that
evening
the
lady
was
in
the
dining
room
before
us
she
was
there
when
we
came
in
and
we
all
nodded
slightly
in
greeting
to
the
actor
she
was
very
kind
quite
making
up
for
her
petulance
of
the
afternoon
when
he
sat
down
he
found
a
letter
in
his
table
napkin
a
written
note
folded
into
the
napkin
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
dropped
everything
he
was
doing
to
unfold
and
read
it
with
an
exclamation
and
a
smile
his
blue
delighted
eyes
splashed
over
her
but
she
was
looking
down
into
her
lap
with
her
forehead
wrinkled
so
he
put
the
note
away
in
his
vest
pocket
then
it
probably
dawned
on
him
that
he
had
betrayed
her
and
he
tried
to
cover
it
up
somehow
well
here
goes
for
food
he
said
as
though
he
were
going
to
require
all
his
energy
for
the
task
of
eating
why
had
she
written
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
speaking
to
him
he
had
after
all
been
sitting
on
the
doorstep
when
she
emerged
from
her
room
and
passed
him
had
she
foreseen
that
the
good
comedian
could
not
contain
himself
but
would
surely
let
a
third
person
into
the
secret
why
probe
or
question
further
the
actor
did
not
eat
much
but
he
looked
very
happy
so
the
note
must
have
said
yes
must
have
been
a
promise
perhaps
she
would
not
tantalize
him
further
xxv
a
few
days
later
they
were
going
to
leave
they
would
travel
together
and
that
would
be
the
end
i
might
have
pitied
them
both
for
though
life
is
good
life
is
stern
one
result
at
any
rate
was
accomplished
she
had
not
sent
for
him
in
vain
nor
had
he
come
in
vain
that
was
the
end
of
the
act
but
there
were
more
acts
to
come
many
more
she
had
lost
much
having
been
ravished
she
gave
herself
away
why
be
niggardly
now
and
this
is
the
destiny
of
her
type
that
they
lose
increasingly
much
retaining
ever
less
what
need
to
hold
back
now
the
ground
has
been
completely
shifted
from
to
the
immolation
of
all
virtue
the
type
is
and
can
be
found
at
resorts
and
where
it
grows
and
flourishes
in
spite
of
her
wasted
adolescence
her
examination
and
her
independence
she
has
been
coming
home
from
her
office
stool
or
her
teacher
desk
more
or
less
exhausted
suddenly
she
finds
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
sweet
and
unlimited
idleness
with
quantities
of
tinned
food
for
her
meals
the
company
round
her
is
continually
changing
tourists
come
and
go
and
she
passes
from
hand
to
hand
for
walks
and
talks
the
tone
is
country
informality
this
is
sheer
loose
living
this
is
a
life
stripped
of
all
purpose
she
does
not
even
sleep
enough
because
she
hears
through
the
thin
wall
every
sound
made
by
her
neighbor
in
the
next
room
while
arriving
or
departing
englishmen
bang
doors
all
night
in
a
short
time
she
has
become
a
neurotic
sated
with
company
surfeited
with
herself
and
the
place
she
is
ready
to
go
off
with
the
next
halfway
respectable
organ
grinder
that
happens
along
and
so
she
pairs
off
with
the
most
casual
visitors
flirts
with
the
guide
hovering
about
him
and
making
bandages
for
his
fingers
and
at
last
throws
herself
into
the
arms
of
a
nameless
nobody
who
has
arrived
at
the
house
today
this
is
the
torsen
type
and
now
at
this
very
moment
she
retires
to
her
room
to
collect
the
fragments
of
herself
in
preparation
for
her
departure
at
the
end
of
the
summer
it
takes
time
there
are
so
many
fragments
one
in
every
corner
but
perhaps
it
consoles
her
to
think
that
she
knows
the
genitive
of
things
are
not
quite
so
bad
for
the
actor
he
has
staked
nothing
is
committed
to
nothing
no
part
of
his
life
is
destroyed
nor
anything
within
him
as
he
came
so
he
goes
cheerful
empty
nice
in
fact
he
is
even
something
more
of
a
man
because
he
has
really
made
a
conquest
he
has
no
wish
but
to
spend
some
pleasant
hours
with
the
torsen
type
he
strolled
about
the
garden
waiting
for
her
to
get
ready
once
she
was
visible
through
the
doorway
and
he
called
to
her
are
you
coming
soon
do
forget
we
got
to
cross
the
mountain
well
i
ca
go
bareheaded
she
replied
he
was
impatient
no
you
got
to
put
your
hat
on
and
what
a
lot
of
time
that
takes
ugh
she
measured
him
coldly
and
said
you
very
familiar
if
he
had
paid
her
back
in
the
same
coin
there
would
have
been
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
cries
of
go
away
go
alone
and
an
hour
delay
and
reconciliation
and
embraces
but
the
actor
manner
changed
at
once
and
he
replied
docilely
as
his
nature
was
familiar
well
perhaps
sorry
then
he
strolled
about
the
garden
again
humming
occasionally
and
swinging
his
stick
i
took
note
of
the
oddly
feminine
shape
of
his
knees
and
the
unusual
plumpness
of
his
thighs
there
was
something
unnatural
about
this
plumpness
as
though
it
did
not
belong
to
his
sex
his
shoes
were
down
at
the
heel
and
his
collar
was
open
his
raincoat
hung
regally
from
his
shoulders
and
flapped
in
the
wind
though
it
was
not
raining
he
was
a
proud
and
comical
sight
but
why
speak
harsh
words
about
a
raincoat
it
was
not
he
the
owner
that
had
abused
it
and
it
hung
from
his
shoulders
as
innocently
as
a
bridal
veil
why
speak
harsh
words
about
anyone
life
is
good
but
life
is
stern
perhaps
when
she
comes
out
i
think
to
myself
the
following
scene
will
take
place
i
stand
here
waiting
only
for
this
departure
so
she
gives
me
her
hand
and
says
why
do
you
say
something
she
asks
in
order
to
seem
bright
and
easy
in
her
mind
because
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
in
the
great
error
of
your
ways
ha
ha
ha
she
laughs
too
loudly
and
in
a
forced
tone
the
great
error
of
my
ways
well
really
and
her
anger
grows
while
i
am
assured
and
fatherly
standing
on
the
firm
ground
of
conscious
virtue
yet
i
say
an
unworthy
thing
like
this
do
throw
yourself
away
miss
torsen
she
raises
her
head
then
yes
the
torsen
type
would
raise
her
head
and
reply
pale
and
offended
throw
myself
away
i
do
understand
you
but
it
is
possible
too
that
miss
torsen
at
heart
a
fine
proud
girl
would
have
a
lucid
moment
and
see
things
in
their
true
light
why
not
why
should
i
throw
myself
away
what
is
there
to
keep
i
am
thrown
away
wasted
ever
since
my
school
days
and
now
i
am
seven
and
twenty
my
own
thoughts
run
away
with
me
as
i
stand
there
wishing
i
were
somewhere
else
perhaps
she
too
in
her
room
wishes
me
far
away
i
say
to
the
actor
will
you
remember
me
to
miss
torsen
i
must
go
now
says
he
shaking
hands
in
some
surprise
ca
you
wait
a
few
minutes
well
all
right
i
give
her
your
greeting
i
take
a
short
cut
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
as
i
know
every
nook
and
corner
i
am
soon
outside
the
farm
and
find
a
good
shelter
from
here
i
shall
see
when
these
two
leave
she
has
only
to
say
now
to
the
people
of
the
farm
it
struck
me
that
yesterday
was
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
her
we
spoke
only
a
few
insignificant
words
that
i
have
forgotten
and
today
i
have
not
spoken
to
her
here
they
come
curious
they
seemed
somehow
to
have
become
welded
together
though
they
walked
separately
up
the
mountain
track
yet
they
belonged
together
they
did
not
speak
the
essential
things
had
probably
already
been
said
life
had
grown
ordinary
for
them
it
still
remained
to
them
to
be
of
use
to
each
other
he
walked
first
while
she
followed
many
paces
behind
it
was
lonely
to
look
at
against
the
rugged
background
of
the
mountain
where
had
her
tall
figure
gone
to
she
seemed
to
have
grown
shorter
because
she
had
hitched
up
her
skirt
and
was
carrying
her
knapsack
on
her
back
they
each
carried
one
but
he
carried
hers
and
she
his
probably
because
owing
to
the
greater
number
of
her
clothes
hers
was
the
heavier
sack
thus
had
they
shifted
their
burdens
what
burdens
would
they
carry
in
the
future
she
was
after
all
no
longer
a
schoolmistress
and
perhaps
he
was
no
longer
with
the
theater
or
the
films
i
watched
those
two
crossing
rocky
mountainous
ground
bare
ground
with
not
a
tree
anywhere
except
a
few
stunted
junipers
far
away
near
the
ridge
murmured
the
little
reisa
those
two
had
put
their
possessions
together
were
walking
together
at
the
next
halt
they
would
be
man
and
wife
and
take
only
one
room
because
it
was
cheaper
suddenly
i
started
up
and
moved
by
some
impulse
of
human
sympathy
nay
of
duty
i
wanted
to
run
across
to
her
talk
to
her
say
a
word
of
warning
do
go
on
i
could
have
done
it
in
a
few
minutes
a
good
deed
a
duty
they
disappeared
behind
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
her
name
was
ingeborg
xxvi
and
now
i
too
must
wander
on
again
for
i
am
the
last
at
the
tore
peak
farm
the
season
is
wearing
on
and
this
morning
it
snowed
for
the
first
time
wet
sad
snow
it
is
very
quiet
at
the
farm
now
and
josephine
might
have
played
the
piano
again
and
been
friendly
to
the
last
guest
but
now
i
am
leaving
too
besides
josephine
has
little
to
play
and
be
cheerful
for
things
have
gone
badly
this
year
and
may
grow
worse
as
time
goes
on
the
prospect
is
not
a
good
one
but
something
will
turn
up
says
josephine
she
need
not
worry
for
she
has
money
in
the
bank
and
no
doubt
there
is
a
young
man
in
the
offing
on
the
other
side
of
the
fjeld
oh
yes
josephine
will
always
manage
she
thinks
of
everything
the
other
day
for
instance
when
miss
torsen
and
her
friend
left
the
friend
could
not
pay
his
bill
and
all
he
said
was
that
he
had
expected
money
but
it
had
come
and
he
could
stay
any
longer
because
of
his
private
affairs
that
was
all
very
well
but
when
would
the
bill
be
paid
why
he
would
send
it
from
the
town
of
course
that
was
where
he
had
his
money
but
how
do
we
know
we
get
the
money
from
him
anyway
said
josephine
we
had
these
here
before
and
i
did
like
the
way
he
swanked
about
outside
thinking
he
was
as
good
as
anybody
and
throwing
his
stick
up
in
the
air
and
catching
it
again
and
then
when
miss
torsen
came
in
to
say
i
told
her
and
i
wondered
if
she
let
me
have
the
money
for
him
miss
torsen
was
shocked
and
said
he
paid
himself
i
said
has
and
this
year
being
such
a
bad
one
we
need
every
penny
so
then
miss
torsen
said
of
course
we
should
get
the
money
how
much
was
it
and
i
told
her
and
she
said
she
pay
for
him
now
but
she
would
see
the
money
was
sent
we
could
trust
her
for
that
and
i
think
we
can
too
we
get
the
money
all
right
if
not
from
him
i
daresay
she
send
it
herself
and
josephine
went
off
to
serve
me
my
dinner
paul
is
on
his
feet
now
too
not
that
his
step
is
always
very
steady
but
at
least
he
puts
his
feet
to
the
ground
but
he
takes
no
interest
in
things
he
does
little
more
than
feeding
the
horses
and
chopping
some
wood
he
ought
to
be
clearing
the
manure
out
of
the
summer
cow
houses
for
autumn
use
but
he
keeps
putting
it
off
and
probably
it
will
not
be
done
at
all
so
far
it
has
mattered
but
this
morning
first
wet
snow
has
covered
the
hay
outdoors
and
the
maltreated
land
and
so
it
will
remain
till
next
spring
poor
paul
he
is
an
easygoing
man
at
heart
but
he
pushes
doggedly
on
against
a
whirlwind
sometimes
he
smiles
to
himself
knowing
how
useless
it
is
to
struggle
a
distorted
smile
his
father
the
old
man
alone
in
his
room
stands
sometimes
on
his
threshold
as
he
used
to
do
and
reflects
he
is
lost
in
memories
for
he
has
ninety
years
behind
him
the
many
houses
on
the
farm
confuse
him
a
little
the
roofs
are
all
too
big
for
him
and
he
is
afraid
they
might
come
down
and
carry
him
off
once
he
asked
josephine
if
it
was
right
that
his
hands
and
fingers
should
run
away
from
him
every
day
across
the
fields
so
they
put
mittens
on
his
hands
but
he
took
to
chewing
them
in
fact
he
ate
everything
he
was
given
and
enjoyed
a
good
digestion
so
they
must
be
thankful
he
had
his
health
josephine
said
and
could
be
up
and
about
i
did
not
follow
the
others
across
the
field
but
returned
the
way
i
had
come
last
spring
down
toward
the
woods
and
the
sea
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
go
back
always
back
never
forward
again
i
passed
the
hut
where
solem
and
i
had
lived
together
and
then
the
lapps
the
two
old
people
and
olga
this
strange
cross
between
a
human
being
and
a
dwarf
birch
a
stove
stood
against
the
peat
wall
and
a
paraffin
lamp
hung
from
the
roof
of
their
dwelling
olga
was
kind
and
helpful
but
she
looked
tiny
and
pathetic
like
a
ruffled
hen
it
pained
me
to
watch
her
flit
about
the
room
tiny
and
crooked
as
she
looked
for
a
pair
of
reindeer
cheeses
for
me
then
i
reached
my
own
hut
of
last
winter
where
i
had
passed
so
many
lonely
months
i
did
not
enter
it
or
rather
i
did
enter
it
for
i
had
to
spend
the
night
there
but
i
shall
skip
this
so
for
the
sake
of
brevity
i
call
it
not
entering
this
morning
i
wrote
something
playful
about
madame
the
mouse
i
left
here
last
spring
but
tonight
i
am
taking
it
out
again
because
i
am
no
longer
in
the
mood
and
because
there
is
no
point
in
it
perhaps
it
would
have
amused
you
to
read
it
my
friend
but
there
is
no
point
in
amusing
you
now
i
must
deject
you
now
and
make
you
listen
to
me
there
is
not
much
more
to
hear
am
i
moralizing
i
am
explaining
no
i
am
not
moralizing
i
am
explaining
if
it
is
moralizing
to
see
the
truth
and
tell
it
to
you
then
i
am
moralizing
can
i
help
that
intuitively
i
see
into
what
is
distant
you
do
not
for
this
is
something
you
can
not
learn
from
your
little
schoolbooks
do
not
let
this
rouse
your
hatred
for
me
i
shall
be
merry
again
with
you
later
when
my
strings
are
tuned
to
merriment
i
have
no
power
over
them
now
they
are
tuned
to
a
chorale
at
dawn
in
the
bright
moonlight
i
leave
the
hut
and
push
on
quickly
in
order
to
reach
the
village
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
must
have
started
too
early
or
walked
too
fast
for
at
this
rate
i
shall
reach
the
village
at
high
noon
what
am
i
chasing
after
perhaps
it
is
feeling
the
nearness
of
the
sea
that
drives
me
forward
and
as
i
stand
on
the
last
high
ridge
with
the
glitter
and
roar
of
the
sea
far
beneath
a
sweetness
darts
through
me
like
a
greeting
from
another
world
i
cry
and
i
wipe
my
eyeglasses
tremblingly
the
roar
from
below
is
sleepless
and
fierce
a
tone
of
jungle
passion
a
savage
litany
i
descend
the
ridge
as
though
in
a
trance
and
reach
the
first
house
there
was
no
one
about
and
a
few
children
faces
at
a
window
suddenly
disappeared
everything
here
was
small
and
poor
though
only
the
barn
was
of
peat
the
house
was
a
timbered
fisherman
home
as
i
entered
the
house
i
saw
that
though
it
was
as
poor
within
as
without
the
floor
was
clean
and
covered
with
pine
twigs
there
were
many
children
here
the
mother
was
busy
cooking
something
over
the
fire
i
was
offered
a
chair
and
sitting
down
began
to
chat
with
a
couple
of
small
boys
as
i
was
in
no
hurry
and
asked
for
nothing
the
woman
said
i
expect
you
want
a
boat
a
boat
i
said
in
my
turn
for
i
had
not
come
by
boat
on
my
last
visit
i
had
walked
instead
over
fjelds
and
valleys
many
miles
from
the
sea
yes
why
not
i
said
but
where
does
it
go
i
thought
you
wanted
a
boat
to
go
to
the
trading
center
she
replied
because
that
where
the
steamer
stops
we
rowed
over
lots
of
people
this
year
great
changes
here
the
motor
traffic
in
stordalen
must
have
completely
altered
all
the
other
traffic
since
my
last
visit
ten
months
ago
where
can
i
stop
for
a
few
days
i
asked
at
the
trading
center
the
other
side
of
the
islands
or
there
eilert
and
olaus
they
both
on
this
side
you
could
go
there
they
got
big
houses
she
showed
me
the
two
places
on
this
side
of
the
water
close
to
the
shore
and
i
proceeded
thither
xxvii
a
large
house
with
and
upper
story
of
planks
built
on
later
displayed
a
new
signboard
on
the
wall
room
and
board
the
barn
as
usual
was
a
peat
hut
as
i
did
not
know
which
was
eilert
and
which
olaus
and
had
stopped
to
consider
which
road
to
take
a
man
came
hurrying
toward
me
ah
well
the
world
is
a
small
place
we
meet
friends
and
acquaintances
everywhere
here
am
i
meeting
an
old
acquaintance
the
thief
of
last
winter
the
pork
thief
what
luck
what
a
satisfaction
this
was
eilert
he
took
in
paying
guests
now
at
first
he
pretended
not
to
recognize
me
but
he
soon
gave
that
up
once
he
had
done
so
however
he
carried
the
thing
off
in
style
well
well
he
said
what
a
nice
surprise
you
are
most
welcome
under
my
humble
roof
and
such
it
is
my
own
response
was
rather
less
jaunty
and
i
stood
still
collecting
my
thoughts
when
i
had
asked
a
few
questions
he
explained
that
since
the
motor
traffic
had
started
in
stordalen
many
visitors
came
through
this
way
and
sometimes
they
wanted
to
stop
over
at
his
house
before
being
rowed
across
to
the
steamer
they
always
came
down
in
the
evenings
and
it
might
be
fine
or
it
might
not
and
at
night
the
fjord
was
often
wild
he
had
therefore
had
to
arrange
to
house
them
because
after
all
you
expect
people
to
spend
the
night
outdoors
so
you
turned
into
a
hotelkeeper
i
said
well
you
can
joke
about
it
he
returned
but
all
i
do
is
to
give
shelter
to
the
people
who
come
here
that
all
the
hotel
there
is
to
it
my
neighbor
olaus
ca
do
any
more
either
even
if
he
builds
a
place
that
ten
times
as
big
look
over
there
now
he
building
another
house
a
shed
i
call
it
and
he
got
three
grown
men
working
on
it
so
he
can
get
it
done
by
next
summer
but
it
wo
be
much
bigger
than
my
place
at
that
and
anyhow
the
gentry
do
want
to
be
bothered
walking
all
that
distance
to
his
place
when
here
my
house
right
at
the
car
stop
and
besides
it
was
me
that
started
it
and
if
i
was
olaus
i
would
have
wanted
to
imitate
me
like
a
regular
monkey
and
started
keeping
boarders
which
i
did
know
the
first
thing
about
but
he
ca
make
himself
any
different
from
what
he
is
so
he
puts
up
a
few
old
bits
of
canvas
and
rugs
and
cardboard
inside
his
barn
and
gets
people
to
sleep
there
but
never
ask
the
gentry
to
sleep
in
a
barn
a
storehouse
for
fodder
and
hay
for
dumb
beasts
if
you
excuse
my
mentioning
it
but
of
course
if
you
no
shame
in
you
and
do
know
how
to
behave
in
company
lucky
i
met
you
i
said
why
i
might
have
gone
on
down
the
road
to
his
place
we
walked
on
together
with
eilert
talking
and
explaining
all
the
way
and
assuring
me
over
and
over
again
that
olaus
was
a
for
copying
him
as
he
did
if
i
had
known
what
was
awaiting
me
i
should
certainly
have
passed
by
eilert
house
but
i
did
not
know
i
was
innocent
though
i
may
not
have
appeared
so
it
can
not
be
helped
it
too
bad
i
got
somebody
in
the
best
room
said
eilert
gentlefolk
from
the
city
they
came
down
here
through
stordalen
and
they
had
to
walk
because
the
cars
have
stopped
for
the
season
they
been
in
my
house
for
quite
some
days
and
i
think
they
be
staying
on
a
while
yet
i
think
they
out
now
but
of
course
it
means
i
ca
let
you
have
my
best
room
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
face
in
the
window
a
shiver
ran
through
me
no
of
course
not
a
shiver
far
from
it
but
certainly
this
was
a
fresh
surprise
what
a
coincidence
as
we
were
about
to
enter
the
door
there
was
the
actor
too
standing
there
looking
at
me
the
actor
from
the
tore
peak
resort
it
was
his
knees
his
coat
and
his
stick
so
i
was
right
i
recognized
her
face
at
an
upper
window
yes
indeed
the
world
is
small
the
actor
and
i
greeted
each
other
and
began
to
talk
how
nice
to
see
me
again
and
how
was
paul
the
good
fellow
still
soaking
himself
in
liquor
he
supposed
funny
effect
it
has
sometimes
paul
seemed
to
think
the
whole
inn
was
an
aquarium
and
we
visitors
the
goldfish
ha
ha
ha
goldfish
i
wish
we
were
i
must
say
well
eilert
are
we
getting
some
fresh
haddock
for
supper
good
really
we
like
it
here
very
much
we
already
been
here
several
days
we
want
to
stay
and
get
a
good
rest
as
we
stood
there
a
rather
stout
girl
came
down
from
the
loft
and
addressed
the
actor
the
missis
wants
you
to
come
right
upstairs
oh
very
well
at
once
well
see
you
later
you
be
stopping
here
too
i
expect
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
eilert
and
i
followed
to
my
room
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
went
out
again
with
eilert
at
once
he
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
me
and
explain
to
me
and
i
was
not
unwilling
to
listen
to
him
then
really
eilert
was
not
too
bad
a
fine
fellow
with
four
ragged
magnificent
youngsters
by
his
first
wife
who
had
died
two
years
before
and
another
child
by
his
second
wife
he
must
have
forgotten
as
he
told
me
this
the
yarn
about
the
sick
wife
and
the
ailing
children
that
he
had
spun
for
me
last
winter
the
girl
who
had
come
down
the
stairs
with
the
message
from
the
missis
was
no
servant
but
eilert
young
wife
and
she
too
was
all
right
strong
and
good
handy
about
the
stables
and
pregnant
again
it
all
looks
good
to
me
eilert
your
wife
and
everything
you
tell
me
about
your
family
no
one
will
understand
my
strange
contentment
then
i
had
been
full
of
an
obscure
happiness
from
the
moment
i
came
to
this
house
probably
a
mere
coincidence
but
that
did
not
detract
from
my
satisfactory
state
of
mind
i
was
pleased
with
everything
and
all
things
added
to
my
cheerful
frame
of
mind
there
were
some
pigs
by
the
barn
very
affectionate
pigs
because
they
were
used
to
the
children
playing
with
them
and
kissing
them
and
riding
on
their
backs
and
there
was
one
of
the
goats
up
on
the
roof
of
course
standing
so
far
out
along
the
edge
that
it
was
a
wonder
he
grow
dizzy
seagulls
flew
over
the
fields
screaming
their
own
language
to
one
another
and
being
friends
or
enemies
to
the
best
of
their
ability
down
by
the
mouth
of
the
river
just
beneath
the
sunset
began
the
great
road
that
winds
up
through
the
woods
and
the
valley
there
is
something
of
the
friendliness
of
a
living
being
about
such
a
forest
road
eilert
was
going
out
in
his
boat
to
fish
haddock
and
i
went
with
him
actually
he
should
have
been
getting
some
meat
for
us
but
he
had
promised
the
gentry
from
the
city
some
fish
and
fish
was
one
of
the
gifts
of
god
besides
if
he
lacked
meat
he
could
always
slaughter
one
of
the
pigs
there
was
a
slight
wind
but
then
we
wanted
some
wind
eilert
said
as
long
as
there
was
not
too
much
of
it
not
reliable
tonight
though
he
said
looking
up
into
the
sky
the
bigger
the
wind
the
stronger
the
current
at
first
i
was
very
brave
and
sat
on
the
thwart
thinking
of
french
words
prekevary
sutinary
and
many
others
they
had
a
long
way
to
travel
coming
here
by
ancient
routes
via
bergen
and
now
they
common
property
and
then
suddenly
i
lost
all
interest
in
french
words
and
felt
extremely
ill
it
was
much
too
windy
and
we
got
no
haddock
pity
she
come
up
so
quick
said
eilert
let
try
inshore
for
a
while
but
we
got
nothing
there
either
and
as
the
wind
increased
and
the
sea
rose
we
better
go
home
said
eilert
the
sea
had
been
just
right
before
remarkably
so
but
now
there
was
entirely
too
much
of
it
why
on
earth
did
i
feel
so
bad
an
inner
exhaustion
some
emotional
excitement
would
have
explained
it
but
i
had
experienced
no
emotional
excitement
we
rowed
in
the
foam
and
feathery
jets
of
spray
she
rising
fast
cried
eilert
rowing
with
all
his
might
i
felt
so
wretched
that
eilert
told
me
to
ship
my
oars
he
would
manage
by
himself
but
for
all
my
wretchedness
i
remembered
that
they
could
see
me
from
the
shore
and
i
would
not
put
down
my
oars
eilert
wife
might
see
me
and
laugh
at
me
what
a
revolting
business
this
seasickness
that
forced
me
to
put
my
head
over
the
gunwale
and
make
a
pig
of
myself
i
had
a
moment
relief
and
then
it
began
all
over
again
charming
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
labor
the
wrong
way
up
of
course
through
my
throat
but
it
was
a
delivery
nonetheless
it
moved
up
then
stopped
came
on
again
and
stopped
came
on
and
stopped
once
more
it
was
a
lump
of
iron
iron
did
i
say
no
steel
i
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
before
it
was
not
something
i
was
born
with
all
my
internal
mechanism
was
stopped
by
it
then
i
took
a
running
start
far
down
inside
me
and
began
strangely
to
howl
with
all
my
strength
but
a
howl
however
successful
can
not
break
down
a
lump
of
steel
the
pains
continued
my
mouth
filled
with
bile
soon
thank
heaven
my
chest
would
burst
o
oh
oh
then
we
rowed
inside
the
islands
that
served
as
a
breakwater
and
i
was
saved
quite
suddenly
i
was
well
again
and
began
to
play
the
clown
imitating
my
own
behavior
in
order
to
deceive
the
people
ashore
and
i
assured
eilert
too
that
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
been
seasick
so
that
he
should
understand
it
was
nothing
to
gossip
about
after
all
he
had
not
heard
about
the
great
seas
i
had
sailed
without
the
slightest
discomfort
once
i
had
been
days
on
the
ocean
with
most
of
the
passengers
in
bed
and
even
the
captain
sick
in
cascades
but
not
me
yes
i
get
seasick
sometimes
too
says
eilert
that
evening
i
sat
eating
alone
in
the
dining
room
since
we
had
not
brought
back
any
haddock
the
visitors
upstairs
had
no
desire
to
come
down
all
they
wanted
eilert
wife
said
was
some
bread
and
butter
and
milk
to
be
sent
up
xxviii
next
morning
they
had
gone
yes
indeed
they
left
at
four
in
the
morning
at
dawn
i
heard
them
perfectly
well
for
my
room
was
near
the
stairs
the
knight
of
the
plump
thighs
came
first
clumping
heavily
down
the
stairs
she
hushed
him
and
her
voice
sounded
angry
eilert
had
just
risen
too
and
they
stood
outside
for
some
minutes
negotiating
with
him
for
the
boat
yes
at
once
they
had
changed
their
minds
and
wanted
to
leave
immediately
then
they
went
down
to
the
boat
eilert
with
them
i
could
see
them
through
the
window
chilled
by
the
cold
of
early
morning
and
with
each
other
there
had
been
a
frost
during
the
night
ice
lay
on
the
water
in
the
buckets
and
the
ground
was
harsh
to
walk
on
poor
things
no
food
no
coffee
a
windy
morning
with
the
sea
still
running
rather
high
there
they
go
with
their
knapsacks
on
their
backs
she
is
still
wearing
her
red
hat
well
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
and
i
lay
down
again
intending
to
sleep
till
about
noon
nothing
was
any
concern
of
mine
except
myself
i
could
not
see
the
boat
from
my
bed
so
i
got
up
again
just
to
while
the
time
away
to
see
how
far
they
had
gone
not
very
far
though
both
men
were
rowing
a
little
later
i
got
up
and
looked
again
oh
yes
they
were
getting
on
i
took
up
my
post
by
the
window
it
was
really
quite
interesting
to
watch
the
boat
getting
smaller
and
smaller
finally
i
opened
the
window
even
looked
through
my
as
it
was
not
yet
quite
light
i
could
not
see
them
very
clearly
but
the
red
hat
was
still
discernible
then
the
boat
disappeared
behind
an
island
i
dressed
and
went
down
the
children
were
all
still
in
bed
but
the
wife
regine
was
up
how
calmly
and
naturally
she
took
everything
do
you
know
where
your
husband
is
i
asked
her
yes
funny
are
they
she
replied
i
never
saw
them
till
after
they
left
gone
down
to
the
fjord
where
do
you
suppose
they
going
haddock
fishing
maybe
was
all
i
said
but
i
thought
to
myself
they
leaving
all
right
they
had
their
knapsacks
on
their
backs
funny
couple
regine
resumed
nothing
to
eat
no
coffee
not
a
thing
and
the
missis
not
wanting
anything
to
eat
last
night
neither
i
merely
shook
my
head
and
went
out
regine
called
to
me
that
coffee
was
nearly
ready
so
if
i
like
a
cup
of
course
the
only
thing
i
could
do
in
the
face
of
such
foolishness
was
to
shake
my
head
and
go
away
one
must
take
the
sensible
view
how
was
it
possible
to
understand
such
behavior
nevertheless
i
the
undersigned
should
have
gone
on
to
olaus
yesterday
instead
of
going
fishing
that
would
have
been
still
more
sensible
what
business
had
i
at
this
house
very
likely
she
found
it
embarrassing
to
be
called
the
missis
and
this
was
why
she
could
neither
eat
last
night
nor
stay
here
today
so
she
had
beaten
a
retreat
with
her
friend
and
her
knapsack
well
it
was
not
much
to
go
away
with
but
perhaps
that
does
matter
as
long
as
one
has
a
reason
to
go
away
later
in
the
forenoon
eilert
returned
home
he
was
alone
but
he
came
up
the
path
carrying
one
of
the
knapsacks
the
larger
one
he
was
in
a
furious
temper
and
kept
saying
they
better
not
try
it
on
him
no
they
just
better
not
of
course
it
was
the
bill
again
she
probably
have
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
of
trouble
i
thought
to
myself
but
no
doubt
she
get
used
to
it
and
take
it
as
nonchalantly
as
it
should
be
taken
there
are
worse
things
but
the
fact
remains
that
it
was
i
that
upset
them
i
that
had
driven
them
away
without
their
clothes
perhaps
they
had
really
expected
some
money
to
be
sent
here
who
knows
i
got
hold
of
eilert
how
big
was
the
bill
what
was
that
all
good
heavens
here
you
are
here
your
money
now
row
across
to
them
at
once
with
their
clothes
but
it
all
proved
in
vain
for
the
strangers
had
gone
they
had
arrived
just
in
time
for
the
boat
and
were
aboard
it
at
that
very
moment
well
there
was
no
help
for
it
here
their
address
says
eilert
we
can
send
the
clothes
next
thursday
that
the
next
trip
the
boat
goes
south
again
i
took
down
the
address
but
i
was
most
ungracious
to
eilert
why
he
have
kept
the
other
knapsack
why
this
particular
one
eilert
replied
that
it
was
true
the
gentleman
had
offered
him
the
other
one
but
he
could
see
from
the
outside
that
it
was
not
so
good
as
this
one
and
i
should
remember
that
the
money
the
missis
had
paid
him
covered
more
than
the
bill
for
one
of
them
so
it
was
only
reasonable
that
he
should
take
the
fullest
knapsack
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
behaved
very
well
and
that
was
the
truth
because
when
she
gave
him
the
larger
knapsack
and
wrote
the
address
she
had
scolded
but
he
had
kept
quiet
and
said
not
another
word
and
anyway
nobody
had
better
try
it
on
him
they
better
not
or
he
know
the
reason
why
eilert
shook
a
fist
at
the
sky
when
he
had
eaten
drunk
his
coffee
and
rested
for
a
while
he
was
not
so
lively
and
talkative
as
on
the
previous
day
he
had
been
brooding
and
speculating
ever
since
last
summer
when
the
motor
traffic
started
and
did
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
him
to
hire
three
grown
men
too
and
build
a
much
bigger
house
than
olaus
so
he
had
caught
it
too
the
great
modern
norwegian
disease
the
knapsack
was
back
in
her
room
again
yes
these
were
her
clothes
i
recognized
her
blouses
her
skirts
and
her
shoes
i
hardly
looked
at
them
of
course
just
unpacked
them
folded
them
neatly
and
put
them
back
in
the
bag
again
because
no
doubt
eilert
had
had
them
all
out
in
a
heap
this
was
really
my
only
reason
for
unpacking
them
xxix
once
more
i
was
run
into
a
party
of
english
the
last
for
this
year
they
arrived
by
steamer
in
the
morning
and
stopped
at
the
trading
station
for
a
few
hours
meanwhile
sending
up
a
detachment
through
the
valley
to
order
a
car
to
meet
them
stordalen
stordalen
they
said
so
they
had
apparently
not
yet
seen
stordalen
an
omission
they
must
repair
at
once
and
what
a
sensation
they
made
they
came
across
by
rowboat
from
the
trading
station
we
could
hear
them
a
long
way
off
an
old
man
voice
drowning
out
all
the
others
eilert
dropped
everything
he
had
in
hand
and
ran
down
to
the
landing
place
in
order
to
be
the
first
on
the
spot
from
olaus
house
too
a
man
and
a
few
boys
went
down
and
from
all
the
houses
round
swarmed
curious
and
helpful
crowds
there
were
so
many
spectators
at
the
landing
place
that
the
old
man
with
the
loud
voice
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
in
the
boat
and
majestically
shouted
his
english
at
us
as
though
his
language
must
of
course
be
ours
as
well
where
the
car
bring
the
car
down
olaus
who
was
sharp
guessed
what
he
meant
and
at
once
sent
his
two
boys
up
the
valley
to
meet
the
car
and
hurry
it
on
for
the
englishmen
had
arrived
they
disembarked
they
were
in
a
great
hurry
they
could
not
understand
why
the
car
had
not
come
to
meet
them
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
there
were
four
of
them
stordalen
they
said
as
they
came
up
past
eilert
house
they
looked
at
their
watches
and
swore
because
so
many
minutes
were
being
wasted
where
the
devil
was
the
car
the
populace
followed
at
some
distance
gazing
with
reverence
on
these
fools
i
remember
a
couple
of
them
an
old
man
the
one
with
the
loud
voice
who
wore
a
pleated
kilt
on
each
thigh
and
a
jacket
of
green
canvas
with
braid
and
buckles
and
straps
and
innumerable
pockets
all
over
it
what
a
man
what
a
power
his
beard
streaming
out
from
under
his
nose
like
the
northern
lights
was
and
he
swore
like
a
madman
another
of
the
party
was
tall
and
bent
a
flagpole
of
sorts
astonishing
stupendous
with
sloping
shoulders
a
tiny
cap
perched
above
extravagantly
arched
eyebrows
he
was
an
upended
roman
battering
ram
a
man
on
stilts
i
measured
him
with
my
eyes
and
still
there
was
something
left
over
yet
he
was
bent
and
broken
old
before
his
time
quite
bald
but
his
mouth
was
tight
as
a
tiger
and
he
had
a
madness
in
his
head
that
kept
him
on
the
move
stordalen
he
cried
england
will
soon
have
to
open
old
people
homes
for
her
sons
she
desexes
her
people
with
sport
and
obsessive
ideas
were
not
other
countries
keeping
her
in
perpetual
unrest
she
would
in
a
couple
of
generations
be
converted
to
pederasty
then
the
horn
of
the
car
was
heard
tooting
in
the
woods
and
everyone
raced
to
meet
it
of
course
olaus
two
boys
had
done
an
honest
day
work
in
meeting
the
car
so
far
up
the
road
and
urging
the
driver
to
hurry
were
they
not
to
get
any
reward
true
they
were
allowed
to
sit
in
the
back
seat
for
their
return
journey
and
thus
enjoyed
the
drive
of
a
lifetime
but
money
they
had
acquired
enough
brazenness
in
the
course
of
the
summer
not
to
hesitate
and
approached
the
old
man
holding
out
their
palms
and
clamoring
money
but
that
did
not
suit
the
old
man
who
entered
the
car
forthwith
urging
his
companions
to
hurry
the
driver
no
doubt
thinking
of
his
own
tips
felt
he
would
serve
his
passengers
best
by
driving
off
with
them
at
once
so
off
he
went
a
toot
of
the
horn
and
a
rapid
fanfare
the
spectators
turned
homeward
talking
about
the
illustrious
visitors
foreign
lands
ah
no
this
country
will
not
bear
comparison
with
them
did
you
see
how
tall
the
younger
lord
was
and
did
you
see
the
other
one
the
one
with
the
skirts
and
the
northern
lights
but
some
of
the
bumpkins
such
as
the
olaus
family
had
more
serious
matters
on
their
minds
olaus
for
the
first
time
understood
what
he
had
read
in
the
paper
so
many
times
that
the
norwegian
elementary
school
is
a
worthless
institution
because
it
does
not
teach
english
to
the
children
of
the
lower
orders
here
were
his
boys
losing
a
handsome
tip
merely
because
they
could
not
swear
back
intelligibly
at
the
gentleman
with
the
northern
lights
the
boys
themselves
had
also
something
to
think
about
that
driver
that
scoundrel
that
southerner
but
just
wait
they
had
heard
that
bits
of
broken
bottle
were
very
good
for
tires
i
return
to
her
knapsack
and
her
clothes
and
the
reason
why
i
do
so
is
that
eilert
is
so
little
to
be
trusted
i
want
to
count
her
clothes
to
make
sure
none
of
them
disappear
it
was
a
mistake
not
to
have
done
so
at
once
it
may
seem
as
though
i
kept
returning
to
these
clothes
and
thinking
about
them
but
why
should
i
do
that
at
any
rate
it
is
now
evident
that
i
was
right
in
suspecting
eilert
for
i
heard
him
going
upstairs
and
when
i
came
in
he
was
turning
out
the
bag
and
going
through
the
clothes
what
are
you
doing
i
said
at
first
he
tried
to
brazen
it
out
never
you
mind
he
replied
but
my
knowing
something
about
him
was
so
much
to
my
advantage
that
he
soon
drew
in
his
horns
how
i
wronged
him
he
complained
and
exploited
him
you
have
bought
these
clothes
he
said
i
could
have
got
more
for
them
if
i
sold
them
he
had
been
paid
but
he
still
wanted
more
like
the
stomach
which
goes
on
digesting
after
death
that
was
eilert
yet
he
was
not
too
bad
he
had
never
been
any
better
and
he
certainly
had
grown
no
worse
with
his
new
livelihood
may
no
one
ever
grow
worse
with
a
new
livelihood
so
i
moved
the
knapsack
and
the
clothes
into
my
own
room
in
order
to
take
better
care
of
them
it
was
a
slow
job
to
tidy
everything
up
for
the
second
time
but
it
had
to
be
done
later
that
evening
i
would
resume
my
journey
taking
the
knapsack
with
me
i
had
done
with
the
place
and
the
nights
were
moonlit
again
enough
of
these
clothes
xxx
once
again
i
am
at
an
age
when
i
walk
in
the
moonlight
thirty
years
ago
i
walked
in
the
moonlight
too
walked
on
crackling
snowy
roads
on
bare
frozen
ground
round
unlocked
barns
on
the
hunt
for
love
how
well
i
remember
it
but
it
is
no
longer
the
same
moonlight
i
could
even
read
by
it
the
letter
she
gave
me
but
there
are
no
such
letters
any
more
everything
is
changed
the
tale
is
told
and
tonight
i
walk
abroad
on
an
errand
of
the
head
not
of
the
heart
i
shall
go
across
to
the
trading
center
and
dispatch
a
knapsack
by
the
steamer
after
that
i
shall
wander
on
and
that
requires
nothing
but
a
little
ordinary
training
in
walking
and
the
light
of
the
moon
to
see
by
but
in
those
old
days
those
young
days
we
studied
the
almanac
in
the
autumn
to
find
out
if
there
would
be
a
moon
on
twelfth
night
for
we
could
use
it
then
everything
is
changed
i
am
changed
the
tale
lies
within
the
teller
they
say
that
old
age
has
other
pleasures
which
youth
has
not
deeper
pleasures
more
lasting
pleasures
that
is
a
lie
yes
you
have
read
right
that
is
a
lie
only
old
age
itself
says
this
in
a
that
flaunts
its
very
rags
the
old
man
has
forgotten
when
he
stood
on
the
summit
forgotten
his
own
self
his
own
red
and
white
blowing
a
golden
horn
now
he
stands
no
longer
no
he
sits
it
is
less
of
a
strain
to
sit
but
now
there
comes
to
him
slow
and
halting
fat
and
stupid
the
honor
of
old
age
what
can
a
sitting
man
do
with
honor
a
man
on
his
feet
can
use
it
to
a
sitting
man
it
is
only
a
possession
but
honor
is
meant
to
be
used
not
to
be
sat
with
let
sitting
men
wear
warm
stockings
what
a
coincidence
another
barn
on
my
road
just
as
in
the
days
of
the
golden
horn
it
offers
me
plenty
of
straw
and
shelter
for
the
night
but
where
is
the
girl
who
gave
me
the
letter
how
warm
her
breath
was
coming
between
lips
a
little
parted
she
will
come
again
of
course
let
us
wait
we
have
plenty
of
time
another
twenty
years
oh
yes
she
will
come
i
must
be
on
my
guard
against
such
traps
i
have
entered
upon
the
honorable
years
i
am
weak
and
quite
capable
of
believing
that
a
barn
is
a
gift
from
above
thou
old
man
here
is
a
barn
for
thee
no
thank
you
i
only
just
in
my
seventies
and
so
in
my
errand
of
the
head
i
pass
by
the
barn
toward
morning
i
find
shelter
under
a
projecting
crag
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
live
under
crags
hereafter
and
i
lie
down
in
a
huddle
small
and
invisible
anything
else
you
please
as
long
as
you
do
flaunt
your
selfishness
and
your
rags
i
am
comfortable
now
lying
with
my
head
on
another
person
knapsack
full
of
used
clothes
i
am
doing
this
solely
because
it
is
just
the
right
size
but
sleep
will
not
come
there
are
only
thoughts
and
dreams
and
lines
of
poetry
and
sentimentality
the
sack
smells
human
and
i
fling
it
away
laying
my
head
on
my
arm
my
arm
smells
of
wood
not
even
wood
but
the
slip
of
paper
with
the
address
have
i
got
the
address
and
i
scratch
a
match
to
read
it
through
and
know
it
by
heart
tomorrow
just
a
line
in
pencil
nothing
but
perhaps
there
is
a
softness
in
the
letters
a
womanliness
i
do
know
it
does
matter
i
manage
to
reach
the
trading
center
at
midday
when
everyone
is
up
and
about
and
the
post
office
open
they
give
me
a
large
sheet
of
wrapping
paper
and
string
and
sealing
wax
i
wrap
the
parcel
and
seal
it
and
write
on
the
outside
there
oh
i
forgot
the
slip
of
paper
with
the
address
to
put
it
inside
i
mean
stupid
but
otherwise
i
have
done
what
i
should
as
i
continue
on
my
way
i
feel
strangely
void
and
deserted
no
doubt
because
the
knapsack
was
quite
heavy
after
all
and
now
i
am
well
rid
of
it
the
last
pleasure
i
think
suddenly
and
as
i
walk
on
i
think
irrelevantly
the
last
country
the
last
island
the
last
pleasure
xxxi
what
now
i
did
know
at
first
the
winter
stood
before
me
my
summer
behind
me
no
task
no
yearning
no
ambition
as
it
made
no
difference
where
i
stayed
i
remembered
a
town
i
knew
and
thought
i
might
as
well
go
there
why
not
a
man
can
not
forever
sit
by
the
sea
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
misunderstand
him
if
he
decides
to
leave
it
so
he
leaves
his
solitude
others
have
done
so
before
him
and
a
mild
curiosity
drives
him
to
see
the
ships
and
the
horses
and
the
tiny
frostbitten
gardens
of
a
certain
town
when
he
arrives
there
he
begins
to
wonder
in
his
idleness
if
he
does
not
know
someone
in
this
town
in
this
terrifyingly
large
town
the
moonlight
is
bright
now
and
it
amuses
him
to
give
himself
a
certain
address
to
visit
evening
after
evening
and
to
take
up
his
post
there
as
though
something
depended
on
it
he
is
not
expected
anywhere
else
so
he
has
the
time
then
one
evening
someone
finds
him
reading
under
a
lamppost
stops
suddenly
and
stares
takes
a
few
steps
toward
him
and
bends
forward
searchingly
is
it
oh
no
excuse
me
i
thought
yes
it
is
good
evening
miss
torsen
why
good
evening
i
thought
it
looked
like
you
good
evening
yes
thank
you
very
well
and
thanks
for
the
knapsack
i
understood
all
at
once
i
quite
understand
do
you
live
here
what
a
strange
coincidence
yes
i
live
here
those
are
my
windows
you
would
like
to
come
up
would
you
no
perhaps
you
would
but
i
know
where
there
are
some
benches
down
by
the
shore
unless
cold
i
suggested
no
i
not
cold
yes
thank
you
i
like
to
we
went
down
to
a
bench
looking
like
a
father
and
daughter
out
walking
there
was
nothing
striking
about
us
and
we
sat
the
whole
evening
undisturbed
later
we
sat
undisturbed
on
other
evenings
all
through
a
cold
autumn
month
then
she
told
me
first
the
short
chapter
of
her
journey
home
some
of
it
only
hinted
suggested
and
some
of
it
in
full
sometimes
with
her
head
deeply
bowed
sometimes
when
i
asked
a
question
replying
by
a
brief
word
or
a
shake
of
the
head
i
write
it
down
from
memory
it
was
important
to
her
and
it
became
important
for
others
as
well
besides
in
a
hundred
years
it
will
all
be
forgotten
why
do
we
struggle
in
a
hundred
years
someone
will
read
about
it
in
memoirs
and
letters
and
think
how
she
wriggled
how
she
fussed
dear
me
there
are
others
about
whom
nothing
at
all
will
be
written
or
read
life
will
close
over
them
like
a
grave
either
way
what
sorrows
she
had
dear
dear
what
sorrows
the
day
she
had
been
unable
to
pay
the
bill
she
thought
herself
the
center
of
the
universe
everybody
stared
at
her
and
she
was
at
her
wits
end
then
she
heard
a
man
voice
outside
saying
have
you
watered
blakka
yet
that
was
preoccupation
so
she
was
not
the
center
of
the
universe
after
all
then
she
and
her
companion
had
left
the
house
and
set
out
on
their
tour
the
center
not
at
all
day
after
day
they
walked
across
fields
and
through
valleys
had
meals
in
houses
by
the
way
and
water
from
the
brooks
if
they
met
other
travelers
they
greeted
them
or
they
did
not
greet
them
no
one
was
less
a
center
of
attention
than
they
and
no
one
more
her
companion
walked
in
vacant
thoughtlessness
whistling
as
he
went
at
one
place
they
stopped
for
food
will
you
pay
for
mine
for
the
time
being
he
said
she
hesitated
and
then
said
briefly
that
she
could
not
pay
for
the
time
being
all
the
way
of
course
not
by
no
means
said
he
just
for
the
moment
perhaps
we
can
get
a
loan
further
down
the
valley
i
do
borrow
ingeborg
said
he
pretending
playfully
to
whimper
what
is
it
nothing
ca
i
say
to
my
own
wife
i
not
your
own
wife
she
said
getting
up
pish
we
were
man
and
wife
last
night
it
says
so
in
the
visitors
book
she
was
silent
at
this
yes
last
night
they
had
been
man
and
wife
that
was
to
save
getting
two
rooms
and
travel
economically
but
she
had
been
very
foolish
to
agree
to
it
torsen
then
he
whimpered
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
game
she
paid
for
both
of
them
and
took
her
knapsack
on
her
back
they
walked
again
at
the
next
stop
she
paid
for
them
both
without
discussion
for
the
evening
meal
for
bed
and
breakfast
it
grew
to
be
a
habit
they
walked
on
once
more
they
reached
the
end
of
the
valley
by
the
sea
and
here
she
revolted
again
go
away
go
on
by
yourself
i
do
want
you
in
my
room
any
more
the
old
argument
no
longer
held
good
when
he
repeated
that
they
saved
money
by
it
she
replied
that
she
for
her
part
required
no
more
than
one
room
and
was
quite
able
to
pay
for
it
he
joked
again
whimpered
ingeborg
and
left
her
he
was
beaten
and
his
back
was
bent
she
ate
alone
that
evening
is
your
husband
coming
in
asked
the
woman
of
the
house
perhaps
he
does
want
anything
she
replied
there
he
stood
away
by
the
tiny
barn
pretending
to
be
interested
in
the
roof
in
the
style
of
building
and
walked
round
looking
at
it
pursing
his
lips
and
whistling
but
she
could
see
perfectly
well
from
the
window
that
his
face
was
blue
and
dejected
when
she
had
eaten
she
walked
down
to
the
shore
calling
as
she
passed
him
go
in
and
eat
but
he
had
not
sunk
quite
so
low
he
would
not
go
in
to
eat
and
slept
under
no
roof
that
night
it
ended
as
such
things
usually
end
when
she
found
him
at
last
next
morning
regretting
her
action
and
shaken
by
his
appearance
everything
slipped
back
again
to
where
it
had
been
they
stopped
at
this
place
a
few
days
waiting
for
the
mail
boat
when
one
evening
an
elderly
man
came
to
the
house
she
knew
him
and
he
knew
them
both
she
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
made
ready
to
leave
at
once
wept
and
beat
her
breast
and
wanted
to
go
home
immediately
at
once
it
ended
as
such
things
usually
end
when
she
had
calmed
down
she
went
to
bed
for
the
night
she
was
not
the
center
of
the
universe
and
the
old
acquaintance
who
had
happened
to
pass
that
way
did
not
appear
to
be
looking
only
at
her
nevertheless
she
staged
a
sort
of
flight
early
next
morning
in
the
gray
dawn
before
other
people
were
up
this
much
she
did
aboard
the
mail
boat
she
met
no
more
acquaintances
and
had
leisure
to
think
things
over
calmly
she
now
broke
with
her
companion
in
earnest
she
had
a
minor
disagreement
with
him
again
for
he
had
no
ticket
and
one
word
gave
rise
to
the
next
it
was
all
very
well
for
her
he
said
she
had
her
return
ticket
in
her
pocket
besides
had
he
not
got
himself
involved
in
all
these
trials
and
tribulations
because
of
her
letter
last
summer
and
was
she
not
ashamed
of
herself
he
would
not
have
moved
a
foot
outside
the
town
had
it
not
been
for
that
letter
of
hers
then
she
gave
him
her
purse
and
all
her
money
and
asked
him
to
leave
her
there
was
probably
enough
to
buy
him
a
ticket
and
now
she
would
be
rid
of
him
of
course
i
should
accept
this
but
there
no
other
way
he
said
and
left
her
she
stood
gazing
across
the
water
and
wondering
what
to
do
she
was
in
a
bad
way
now
so
very
different
from
what
she
had
once
thought
what
shame
what
utter
futility
she
had
wandered
into
she
brooded
till
she
was
worn
out
then
she
began
to
listen
to
what
people
about
her
were
saying
two
men
were
huddled
on
benches
trying
to
shelter
from
the
wind
she
heard
one
of
them
say
he
was
a
schoolmaster
and
the
other
that
he
was
an
artisan
the
schoolmaster
did
not
remain
seated
long
but
got
up
and
swaggered
toward
her
she
passed
him
in
silence
and
took
his
place
on
the
bench
it
was
a
raw
autumn
day
and
it
did
her
good
to
get
out
of
the
wind
the
artisan
probably
thought
this
tall
lady
had
a
berth
but
when
she
sat
down
he
moved
over
on
his
own
bench
he
was
on
the
point
of
lighting
his
pipe
but
stopped
go
on
do
mind
me
she
said
so
he
lit
it
but
he
was
careful
not
to
blow
the
smoke
into
her
face
he
was
only
a
youngster
a
little
over
twenty
with
thick
reddish
hair
under
his
cap
and
whitish
eyebrows
high
up
on
his
forehead
his
chest
was
broad
and
flat
but
his
back
was
round
and
his
hands
massive
a
great
horse
then
a
tray
was
brought
him
sandwiches
and
coffee
which
he
had
evidently
been
waiting
for
he
paid
but
went
on
smoking
and
let
the
food
stand
please
eat
she
said
you
do
mind
my
sitting
here
not
at
all
he
replied
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
slowly
taking
plenty
of
time
over
it
then
sat
still
again
i
do
really
need
anything
to
eat
yet
either
he
said
oh
have
you
come
far
no
only
last
night
where
do
you
come
from
lady
from
the
town
i
been
on
holiday
that
what
i
thought
he
said
nodding
his
head
i
been
up
at
the
tore
peak
farm
she
added
the
tore
peak
so
do
you
know
it
no
but
i
know
some
of
the
people
there
a
pause
josephine
there
he
resumed
yes
do
you
know
her
oh
no
they
talked
a
little
more
the
boat
sailed
on
and
they
sat
there
talking
it
was
all
they
had
to
do
she
asked
where
he
came
from
and
what
his
trade
was
and
it
seemed
he
was
nothing
important
only
a
paltry
carpenter
and
his
mother
had
a
small
farm
would
the
lady
like
a
simple
cup
of
coffee
why
yes
thank
you
could
she
have
a
little
of
his
just
a
little
in
the
saucer
she
poured
some
of
the
coffee
into
the
saucer
and
asked
for
a
bite
of
food
as
well
never
had
food
tasted
so
good
and
when
she
had
finished
she
thanked
him
for
that
too
have
you
a
berth
he
asked
yes
but
i
rather
stay
here
she
said
if
i
go
below
i
be
sick
that
what
i
thought
well
now
i
wonder
with
that
he
got
up
and
walked
slowly
and
heavily
away
she
watched
his
back
disappearing
down
the
companion
to
the
lower
deck
she
waited
for
him
a
long
time
fearing
that
someone
else
might
come
and
take
his
place
coffee
from
the
saucer
a
sandwich
with
the
carpenter
nothing
wily
or
unnatural
about
that
this
sheltered
corner
seemed
to
her
like
a
tiny
foothold
in
life
there
he
was
coming
back
with
more
food
and
coffee
a
whole
tray
in
his
big
hands
he
laughed
at
himself
for
walking
so
carefully
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
overdid
things
a
little
great
heavens
really
you
much
much
too
kind
well
i
thought
since
you
were
sitting
here
anyhow
they
both
ate
she
grew
warm
and
sleepy
and
leaned
back
every
time
she
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
the
carpenter
lighting
his
pipe
he
struck
two
or
three
matches
at
once
but
he
was
in
no
hurry
they
were
always
half
burned
before
he
put
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
began
to
suck
at
it
the
schoolmaster
called
something
to
him
drew
his
attention
to
something
far
inland
but
the
carpenter
merely
nodded
and
said
nothing
i
wonder
if
he
afraid
he
wake
me
she
thought
at
one
stop
her
former
traveling
companion
turned
up
again
he
had
been
below
in
the
cabin
are
you
coming
down
ingeborg
he
asked
she
did
not
reply
the
carpenter
looked
from
one
to
the
other
miss
torsen
then
whimpered
the
traveling
companion
playfully
he
stood
waiting
a
moment
and
finally
went
away
ingeborg
the
carpenter
was
probably
thinking
miss
torsen
he
was
thinking
how
long
will
you
be
in
the
town
she
asked
getting
up
oh
i
be
there
some
time
what
are
you
doing
there
he
was
a
little
embarrassed
and
since
his
skin
was
so
fair
she
could
see
at
once
that
he
reddened
he
bent
forward
planting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
before
he
replied
i
want
to
learn
a
little
more
in
my
trade
be
an
apprentice
maybe
it
all
depends
oh
i
see
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
asked
i
think
it
a
good
idea
do
you
they
were
on
deck
nearly
the
whole
of
the
day
but
toward
evening
it
turned
bitter
cold
and
windy
when
she
had
grown
stiff
with
sitting
she
got
up
and
stamped
her
feet
and
when
she
had
stamped
till
she
was
tired
she
sat
down
again
once
when
she
was
standing
a
little
distance
away
she
saw
the
carpenter
place
a
parcel
on
the
bench
as
though
to
keep
her
seat
for
her
her
quondam
traveling
companion
stuck
his
head
out
of
a
doorway
the
wind
blowing
his
hair
forward
over
his
forehead
and
cried
ingeborg
go
below
will
you
oh
she
groaned
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
fury
the
ship
heeled
over
on
its
side
as
she
walked
toward
him
and
she
had
to
take
a
few
skips
to
keep
her
balance
i
do
want
you
to
talk
to
me
again
she
hissed
at
him
do
you
hear
i
mean
it
by
all
that
holy
good
gracious
he
exclaimed
and
disappeared
at
about
three
the
carpenter
turned
up
with
coffee
and
sandwiches
again
really
you
must
be
doing
this
all
the
time
she
said
he
merely
laughed
again
and
told
her
to
eat
if
she
thought
it
was
good
enough
we
soon
be
there
now
she
said
as
she
ate
have
you
someone
to
go
to
oh
yes
i
have
a
sister
slowly
and
thoughtfully
he
took
another
sandwich
and
turned
it
over
looking
at
it
absently
before
he
took
a
bite
out
of
it
when
he
had
finished
one
mouthful
he
took
another
and
when
he
had
finished
that
one
too
he
said
i
thought
that
as
i
going
to
stay
in
town
over
the
winter
i
better
learn
something
and
what
with
the
farm
as
well
yes
indeed
you
think
so
too
oh
yes
i
think
so
why
did
he
tell
her
about
his
private
affairs
she
had
private
affairs
of
her
own
she
thanked
him
for
the
sandwiches
and
got
up
as
the
boat
drew
alongside
the
pier
he
offered
her
his
hand
and
said
my
name
is
nikolai
oh
yes
i
thought
in
case
we
meet
again
nikolai
palm
but
i
expect
the
too
big
yes
i
expect
it
is
well
thanks
ever
so
much
for
all
your
kindness
xxxii
i
ask
miss
torsen
have
you
met
the
carpenter
since
what
carpenter
oh
no
i
have
i
only
told
you
about
him
because
a
sort
of
mutual
acquaintance
acquaintance
yes
of
yours
and
mine
only
indirectly
of
course
he
happens
to
be
the
brother
of
that
schoolmistress
miss
palm
that
was
at
the
tore
peak
farm
last
summer
well
the
world
a
small
place
we
all
belong
to
the
same
family
and
that
why
i
told
you
all
this
about
him
but
you
did
find
out
about
this
relationship
on
the
boat
did
you
so
you
must
have
met
him
since
yes
well
no
that
is
to
say
i
seen
him
a
few
times
but
not
to
speak
to
we
just
said
good
morning
and
how
are
you
and
so
on
then
he
said
he
was
her
brother
ha
ha
ha
it
was
just
in
passing
quite
by
accident
this
gave
me
a
good
opportunity
for
saying
what
a
lot
of
things
are
accidental
it
was
an
accident
that
i
should
have
stopped
under
a
particular
lamppost
to
look
up
something
to
read
a
few
lines
and
then
you
happened
to
live
there
that
right
i
expect
you
and
the
carpenter
will
be
getting
married
i
said
ha
ha
no
indeed
i
sha
marry
anyone
no
you
have
to
be
pretty
naïve
to
marry
well
i
do
know
that
being
naïve
does
any
harm
being
not
quite
so
clever
where
does
your
cleverness
lead
you
only
to
being
cheated
because
there
is
anybody
who
quite
clever
enough
i
should
have
thought
being
clever
is
just
the
thing
to
protect
you
against
being
cheated
what
else
would
it
do
exactly
what
else
but
the
trouble
is
we
trust
our
cleverness
so
much
that
we
get
cheated
that
way
or
else
we
let
things
go
from
bad
to
worse
because
why
should
we
worry
after
all
we
got
our
cleverness
to
help
get
us
out
of
the
mess
well
in
that
case
it
pretty
hopeless
relying
on
your
cleverness
yes
that
was
your
own
opinion
last
summer
you
know
yes
i
remember
that
i
thought
oh
i
do
know
but
when
i
came
back
to
town
again
it
was
as
though
a
pause
i
do
know
what
to
think
she
said
and
i
do
because
i
old
and
wise
you
see
miss
torsen
in
the
old
days
people
did
think
so
much
about
cleverness
and
secondary
schools
and
the
right
to
vote
they
lived
their
lives
on
a
different
plane
they
were
naïve
i
wonder
if
that
was
a
pretty
good
way
to
live
of
course
people
were
cheated
in
those
days
too
but
they
did
smart
under
it
so
they
bore
it
with
greater
natural
strength
we
have
lost
our
healthy
powers
of
endurance
it
getting
cold
she
said
shall
we
go
home
yes
of
course
all
quite
true
but
we
living
in
modern
times
we
ca
change
the
times
i
ca
at
any
rate
i
got
to
keep
up
with
the
times
yes
that
what
it
says
in
the
oslo
morning
paper
because
it
used
to
say
so
in
the
freie
but
a
person
with
character
goes
his
own
way
up
to
a
point
even
if
the
majority
go
a
different
way
yes
well
i
really
going
to
tell
you
something
now
she
said
stopping
i
go
to
a
really
sensible
school
during
the
day
do
you
i
said
only
this
time
i
learning
housekeeping
is
that
a
good
thing
you
mean
you
learning
to
cut
sandwiches
for
yourself
ha
ha
well
you
said
you
were
going
to
marry
oh
i
do
know
very
well
you
marry
you
settle
down
in
his
valley
but
first
you
have
to
learn
housekeeping
so
that
you
can
make
an
omelette
or
possibly
a
pudding
for
tourists
or
englishmen
that
pass
through
his
valley
whose
valley
you
much
better
go
to
his
mother
and
learn
all
the
housekeeping
you
going
to
need
from
her
really
really
she
said
smiling
as
she
walked
on
again
you
quite
on
the
wrong
track
it
is
he
it
is
anybody
so
much
the
worse
for
you
there
ought
to
be
somebody
yes
but
suppose
it
not
the
one
i
want
oh
yes
it
will
be
the
one
you
want
you
big
enough
and
handsome
enough
and
capable
enough
thank
you
very
much
but
well
thanks
so
much
good
night
why
did
she
break
off
so
suddenly
and
leave
me
so
hurriedly
almost
at
a
run
was
she
crying
i
should
have
liked
to
have
said
more
to
have
been
wise
and
circumstantial
and
made
useful
suggestions
but
i
was
left
standing
in
a
kind
of
stupid
surprise
then
something
happened
we
have
seen
each
other
for
such
a
long
time
she
said
the
next
time
we
met
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
shall
we
take
a
short
walk
i
was
just
going
to
post
a
letter
i
see
yes
i
was
going
to
post
a
letter
it
only
it
not
we
went
to
a
newspaper
office
with
the
letter
it
was
evidently
an
advertisement
perhaps
she
was
trying
to
find
a
situation
as
she
came
out
of
the
office
a
gentleman
greeted
her
she
turned
a
deep
red
and
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
two
stone
steps
leading
from
the
entrance
her
head
was
bent
almost
to
her
chest
as
though
she
were
looking
very
carefully
at
the
steps
before
venturing
to
come
down
them
they
greeted
each
other
again
the
stranger
shook
her
hand
and
they
began
to
talk
he
was
a
man
of
her
own
age
with
a
soft
fair
beard
and
dark
eyebrows
that
looked
as
though
he
had
blacked
them
he
wore
a
top
hat
and
his
overcoat
which
was
open
was
lined
with
silk
i
heard
them
mention
an
evening
of
the
previous
week
on
which
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
it
had
been
a
relaxation
there
had
been
quite
a
party
first
out
driving
then
at
supper
together
it
was
a
memory
they
had
in
common
miss
torsen
did
say
much
she
seemed
a
little
embarrassed
but
smiling
and
beautiful
i
began
to
look
at
the
illustrated
papers
displayed
in
the
window
when
suddenly
the
thought
struck
me
good
god
she
in
love
look
i
have
a
suggestion
he
said
then
they
discussed
something
agreed
about
something
and
she
nodded
after
that
he
left
her
she
came
toward
me
slowly
and
in
silence
i
spoke
to
her
about
some
of
the
pictures
in
the
window
yes
she
said
just
think
but
she
gazed
at
them
without
seeing
anything
silently
we
walked
on
and
for
several
minutes
at
least
she
said
nothing
hans
flaten
never
changes
she
said
finally
is
that
who
it
was
i
asked
his
name
flaten
yes
i
remember
you
mentioned
the
name
last
summer
who
is
he
his
father
a
merchant
but
he
himself
his
father
owns
the
big
shop
in
almes
street
you
know
yes
but
what
about
what
does
he
do
i
do
know
if
he
does
anything
special
he
just
studies
his
so
rich
you
know
i
recalled
old
flaten
shop
in
almes
street
a
good
solid
shop
in
the
mornings
the
yard
was
always
full
of
horses
while
the
owners
were
busy
making
purchases
in
the
shop
he
such
a
man
of
the
world
she
went
on
he
simply
throws
money
about
banknotes
when
he
goes
anywhere
the
people
all
whisper
flaten
he
dresses
as
though
he
were
a
baron
i
said
yes
she
replied
rather
offended
yes
he
dresses
well
always
has
is
that
the
man
you
want
i
asked
lightly
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
resolute
nod
yes
what
that
dandy
why
not
we
old
friends
we
gone
to
school
together
spent
a
lot
of
time
together
it
really
based
on
a
firm
foundation
he
the
only
man
i
ever
been
in
love
with
in
all
my
life
and
it
lasted
many
years
sometimes
i
admit
i
forget
him
but
the
moment
i
see
him
again
as
much
in
love
as
ever
i
told
him
so
and
we
both
laugh
about
it
but
that
does
change
it
it
queer
then
i
suppose
he
too
rich
to
marry
her
i
thought
and
asked
nothing
more
when
we
parted
i
said
where
does
carpenter
nikolai
work
i
do
know
she
replied
oh
yes
i
do
know
we
near
there
and
i
can
show
you
if
you
like
what
do
you
want
to
see
him
for
nothing
i
just
wondered
if
he
at
a
good
place
with
a
competent
master
why
did
i
indeed
want
to
see
carpenter
nikolai
the
artisan
yet
i
have
visited
him
and
made
his
acquaintance
he
is
a
bull
in
stature
strong
and
a
man
of
few
words
last
saturday
we
saw
the
town
together
why
i
do
know
but
i
suggested
it
myself
i
made
friends
with
the
carpenter
for
my
own
sake
because
of
my
loneliness
i
no
longer
went
to
the
benches
by
the
shore
as
the
weather
was
a
little
too
cold
and
miss
torsen
interested
me
very
little
now
she
had
changed
so
much
since
returning
to
the
town
she
had
become
more
the
ordinary
type
of
girl
not
in
any
one
thing
but
in
general
she
thought
of
nothing
but
vanities
and
nonsense
and
seemed
quite
to
have
forgotten
her
last
summer
wholesome
bitter
view
of
life
now
she
was
back
at
school
again
in
her
leisure
hours
meeting
the
gentleman
named
flaten
and
this
occupied
all
of
her
time
either
she
had
no
depths
or
she
had
been
vitiated
in
the
vital
years
of
adolescence
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
she
asked
of
course
i
going
to
school
again
i
been
going
to
school
ever
since
i
was
a
child
i
no
good
at
anything
else
i
can
only
learn
that
what
i
used
to
there
is
much
i
can
think
or
do
on
my
own
and
i
do
enjoy
it
either
so
what
do
you
expect
no
what
could
i
expect
carpenter
nikolai
went
to
the
circus
he
was
not
much
surprised
at
anything
he
saw
there
or
he
pretended
not
to
be
the
acrobatics
on
horseback
well
not
bad
but
after
all
the
tiger
i
thought
tigers
were
much
bigger
besides
his
big
heavy
head
seemed
preoccupied
with
other
thoughts
and
he
paid
little
attention
to
the
women
riders
who
were
doing
their
tricks
on
the
way
home
he
said
i
ought
not
to
ask
you
i
expect
but
would
you
go
to
the
with
me
tomorrow
evening
the
what
that
it
a
place
where
they
dance
a
dance
hall
in
other
words
where
is
it
do
you
feel
so
much
like
dancing
no
not
much
you
want
to
see
what
goes
on
there
yes
all
right
i
go
it
was
on
a
sunday
evening
the
girls
and
boys
own
evening
that
the
carpenter
and
i
went
to
the
dance
he
had
decked
himself
out
in
a
starched
collar
and
a
heavy
watch
chain
but
he
was
very
young
and
when
you
are
young
you
look
well
in
anything
he
had
such
remarkable
strength
that
it
was
never
necessary
for
him
to
give
way
this
had
lent
him
assurance
and
authority
if
you
spoke
to
him
he
was
slow
to
reply
and
if
you
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
was
slow
in
turning
round
to
see
who
had
greeted
him
he
was
a
pleasant
companion
we
went
to
the
booking
office
there
was
no
one
there
and
the
window
was
closed
moreover
a
notice
on
the
wall
announced
that
the
hall
was
let
to
a
private
club
for
the
first
two
hours
of
the
evening
a
few
young
people
came
along
as
we
were
standing
there
read
the
notice
and
went
away
again
the
carpenter
was
unwilling
to
go
looked
round
and
went
in
through
the
gate
as
though
looking
for
someone
we
ca
do
anything
about
it
i
called
after
him
no
he
said
but
i
wonder
he
crossed
the
yard
and
began
to
look
up
at
all
the
windows
a
man
came
down
the
stairs
what
is
it
he
asked
my
friend
wanted
to
buy
a
ticket
i
replied
the
carpenter
still
showed
no
inclination
to
return
from
the
yard
the
man
approached
me
and
proved
to
be
the
landlord
he
explained
like
the
notice
that
a
club
had
rented
the
hall
for
the
first
two
hours
come
along
we
ca
get
in
i
called
to
my
companion
but
he
was
in
no
hurry
so
i
chatted
with
the
landlord
while
waiting
for
him
yes
it
rather
an
exclusive
club
only
eight
couples
but
just
the
same
they
hired
a
full
orchestra
rich
people
you
see
they
had
refreshments
and
plenty
of
champagne
and
then
they
danced
as
though
their
lives
depended
on
it
why
they
did
it
oh
well
young
people
rich
and
fashionable
bored
by
sunday
evening
at
home
they
wanted
to
work
off
the
week
idleness
in
two
hours
so
they
danced
not
unusual
really
and
of
course
said
the
landlord
i
earn
more
in
those
two
hours
than
in
the
whole
of
the
evening
otherwise
liberal
people
they
do
count
the
pennies
and
yet
there
no
wear
and
tear
because
of
course
people
like
that
do
dance
on
their
heels
the
carpenter
who
had
come
halfway
back
stood
listening
to
us
what
sort
of
people
are
they
generally
speaking
i
inquired
businessmen
officers
or
what
excuse
me
but
i
ca
tell
you
that
replied
the
landlord
it
a
private
party
that
all
i
can
say
for
instance
i
do
even
know
who
they
are
the
money
just
came
by
special
messenger
it
flaten
said
the
carpenter
flaten
is
it
said
the
landlord
as
though
he
did
not
know
it
flaten
has
been
here
before
he
a
fine
gentleman
always
in
fashionable
company
so
it
flaten
is
it
well
excuse
me
i
must
have
another
look
round
the
hall
the
landlord
left
us
but
the
carpenter
followed
him
could
we
look
on
he
asked
what
at
the
dancing
oh
no
in
a
corner
somewhere
no
i
could
allow
that
i
do
even
let
my
own
wife
and
daughter
in
nobody
not
a
soul
they
would
like
it
are
you
coming
or
i
called
as
though
for
the
last
time
yes
i
coming
said
the
carpenter
turning
back
so
you
knew
about
this
party
i
said
yes
he
replied
she
talked
about
it
last
friday
who
talked
about
it
miss
torsen
yes
she
said
i
might
sit
in
the
gallery
we
walked
on
down
the
street
each
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
or
perhaps
with
the
same
thought
i
at
least
was
furious
really
my
good
nikolai
i
have
no
desire
to
buy
tickets
in
order
to
look
at
flaten
and
his
ladies
no
curious
idea
of
hers
inviting
this
man
to
watch
her
dance
it
was
preposterous
but
like
her
last
summer
too
did
she
not
like
a
third
party
within
hearing
whenever
she
sailed
close
to
the
wind
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
asked
the
carpenter
as
calmly
as
i
could
did
miss
torsen
want
me
to
sit
in
the
gallery
too
did
she
say
anything
about
that
no
he
replied
did
she
say
anything
about
me
no
you
lying
i
thought
and
i
daresay
she
told
you
to
lie
i
was
highly
incensed
but
i
could
not
squeeze
the
truth
out
of
the
carpenter
cars
rolled
up
behind
us
and
stopped
at
the
nikolai
turned
and
wanted
to
go
back
but
when
he
saw
that
i
kept
straight
on
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
followed
me
i
heard
him
once
sighing
heavily
we
strolled
the
streets
for
an
hour
while
i
cooled
off
and
made
myself
agreeable
to
my
companion
again
we
had
a
glass
of
beer
together
then
went
to
a
cinema
and
afterward
to
a
shooting
gallery
finally
we
went
to
a
skittle
ground
where
we
stayed
for
some
time
nikolai
was
the
first
to
want
to
leave
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
was
suddenly
in
a
tearing
hurry
he
was
hardly
even
willing
to
finish
the
game
we
had
to
pass
the
again
the
cars
had
gone
just
as
i
thought
said
the
carpenter
looking
very
disappointed
i
believe
he
would
have
liked
to
be
present
when
the
party
came
out
to
enter
their
cars
he
looked
up
and
down
the
empty
street
and
repeated
just
as
i
thought
he
was
suddenly
anxious
to
go
home
no
let
go
inside
i
said
it
was
a
big
handsome
hall
with
a
platform
for
the
orchestra
and
a
throng
of
people
on
the
great
floor
we
sat
in
the
gallery
looking
on
there
was
a
very
mixed
crowd
seamen
artisans
hotel
staff
shop
assistants
casual
workers
the
ladies
were
apparently
seamstresses
servant
girls
and
shopgirls
with
a
sprinkling
of
damsels
who
had
no
daytime
occupation
the
floor
was
crowded
with
dancers
in
addition
to
a
constable
whose
duty
it
was
to
intervene
if
necessity
arose
the
establishment
had
its
own
commissionaire
who
walked
about
the
hall
with
a
stick
keeping
an
eye
on
the
assembled
company
as
soon
as
a
dance
was
finished
the
gentlemen
all
crowded
to
the
platform
and
paid
ten
if
anyone
seemed
to
be
trying
to
cheat
the
commissionaire
would
tap
him
politely
on
the
arm
with
his
stick
gentlemen
who
had
to
be
tapped
many
times
were
regarded
as
suspicious
characters
and
might
as
a
last
resource
even
be
expelled
order
was
admirably
maintained
waltz
mazurka
schottische
square
dance
waltz
i
soon
noticed
a
man
who
was
dancing
with
great
assiduity
never
stopping
once
tall
swarthy
lively
a
heartbreaker
the
ladies
clustered
round
him
can
that
be
solem
down
there
dominating
the
crowd
i
thought
would
you
like
to
dance
i
asked
carpenter
nikolai
oh
no
he
replied
with
a
smile
then
we
can
leave
any
time
you
like
all
right
he
said
and
remained
seated
your
thoughts
seem
to
be
far
away
a
long
pause
i
was
thinking
that
i
have
a
horse
on
my
farm
i
have
to
carry
all
the
manure
and
the
wood
myself
so
that
why
you
so
strong
i
have
to
go
home
in
a
few
days
and
chop
wood
for
the
winter
yes
of
course
you
will
i
was
going
to
say
he
persisted
and
then
fell
silent
yes
no
it
no
use
suggesting
it
i
have
liked
you
to
come
with
me
this
winter
though
i
got
a
small
spare
room
why
should
i
go
there
still
it
was
a
bad
idea
it
would
be
nice
if
you
could
said
the
carpenter
just
then
i
heard
the
name
of
solem
mentioned
in
the
hall
yes
there
he
was
swaggering
as
usual
the
solem
from
tore
peak
he
was
standing
alone
in
high
spirits
announcing
that
he
was
solem
solem
my
lad
he
appeared
not
to
be
in
the
company
of
any
one
lady
for
i
saw
him
choosing
partners
indiscriminately
then
he
chose
the
wrong
lady
and
her
partner
shook
his
head
and
said
no
solem
remembered
that
he
allowed
the
couple
to
dance
the
next
dance
and
when
it
was
finished
approached
again
and
bowed
to
the
lady
once
more
he
was
refused
the
lady
appearance
was
striking
sophisticated
or
innocent
who
could
tell
tall
grecian
in
a
black
frock
without
trimming
how
quiet
and
retiring
she
was
of
course
she
was
a
tart
but
what
a
gentle
one
a
nun
of
vice
with
a
face
as
pure
as
that
of
a
repentant
sinner
peerless
this
was
a
woman
for
solem
it
was
after
he
had
received
his
second
no
from
the
gentleman
that
he
began
to
talk
to
tell
everyone
that
he
was
solem
my
lad
but
his
boasts
were
dull
something
was
going
to
happen
he
would
show
them
an
image
of
sin
there
was
no
sting
in
it
just
old
familiar
rubbish
these
people
had
heard
before
the
commissionaire
crossed
over
to
him
and
asked
him
to
be
quiet
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
constable
by
the
door
this
pouring
of
oil
on
the
waters
was
successful
for
solem
himself
said
hush
we
must
make
trouble
but
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
grecian
and
her
partner
he
allowed
a
few
dances
to
pass
again
himself
engaging
other
partners
to
dance
with
there
was
now
a
huge
crowd
all
the
having
by
this
time
arrived
many
were
crowded
off
the
floor
and
had
to
wait
rushing
to
get
first
place
in
the
next
dance
instead
then
something
happened
a
couple
slipped
and
fell
it
was
solem
and
his
partner
as
he
was
getting
up
again
he
tripped
up
another
couple
the
grecian
and
her
partner
both
of
whom
fell
down
and
solem
was
so
strangely
clumsy
as
he
rose
that
his
long
arms
and
legs
brought
down
a
third
couple
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
squirming
heap
on
the
floor
screams
and
oaths
were
heard
people
grew
angry
and
kicked
one
another
while
solem
skillfully
directed
the
disaster
with
sincere
and
wholehearted
malevolence
couple
after
couple
met
their
waterloo
over
those
already
fallen
the
commissionaire
poked
them
with
his
stick
exhorting
them
to
get
up
the
constable
himself
assisted
him
and
the
music
stopped
in
the
meantime
solem
acting
with
the
better
part
of
valor
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
did
not
return
gradually
the
fallen
couples
got
to
their
feet
again
rubbing
their
shins
dusting
off
their
clothes
some
laughing
others
swearing
the
grecian
lady
partner
had
a
bleeding
wound
on
his
temple
and
put
his
hands
to
his
head
in
a
daze
questions
were
being
asked
about
that
what
was
his
name
that
tall
fellow
who
had
started
all
the
trouble
solem
said
some
of
the
ladies
threats
were
uttered
against
solem
he
was
the
one
go
and
find
him
somebody
we
show
him
why
he
could
help
it
said
the
ladies
ah
solem
solem
how
the
ladies
loved
him
but
the
grecian
rose
from
the
dust
as
from
a
bath
the
sand
from
the
floor
clung
to
her
black
dress
making
it
look
as
though
spangled
with
stardust
submissively
she
accepted
the
lot
of
lying
under
all
the
others
entwined
in
their
legs
and
smiled
when
someone
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
comb
in
her
grecian
knot
was
crushed
xxxiii
today
the
first
of
october
forty
years
ago
we
drove
the
snowplow
at
home
yes
i
regret
to
say
that
i
remember
forty
years
ago
nothing
escapes
my
attention
yet
but
everything
moves
past
me
i
sit
in
the
gallery
looking
on
if
nikolai
the
carpenter
had
been
observant
he
would
have
seen
my
fingers
closing
and
opening
again
my
absurdity
augmented
by
affectation
and
grimacing
fortunately
he
was
a
child
in
the
end
i
left
it
all
behind
me
and
took
my
proper
seat
my
address
is
the
chimney
corner
now
it
is
winter
again
with
snow
over
the
north
and
claptrap
in
the
town
this
is
my
desolate
period
my
wheels
stop
my
hair
stops
growing
my
nails
stop
growing
everything
stops
growing
but
the
days
of
my
life
and
it
is
well
that
my
days
increase
from
now
on
it
is
well
not
much
happens
during
the
winter
well
of
course
nikolai
has
got
an
overcoat
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
did
really
need
it
he
says
but
he
bought
it
because
of
the
advertisement
and
it
was
dear
twenty
but
he
got
it
for
eighteen
i
am
sure
nikolai
is
much
happier
about
his
overcoat
than
flaten
is
about
his
but
let
me
not
forget
flaten
for
something
has
happened
to
him
his
friends
have
given
him
a
farewell
party
and
drunk
him
out
of
bachelordom
for
he
is
going
to
marry
it
is
miss
torsen
who
told
me
this
i
met
her
by
accident
again
under
her
own
lamppost
and
she
told
me
then
and
you
not
wearing
mourning
i
said
oh
no
she
said
smiling
no
it
something
i
known
a
long
time
besides
perhaps
i
not
very
faithful
i
do
know
i
think
you
hit
the
truth
there
she
looked
startled
what
do
you
mean
i
think
you
changed
very
much
since
last
summer
you
were
straight
and
competent
then
you
saw
clearly
you
knew
what
you
wanted
what
happened
to
your
tinge
of
bitterness
or
have
you
no
longer
reason
to
be
bitter
this
was
all
too
gravely
spoken
but
i
was
like
a
father
and
meant
well
she
began
to
walk
on
her
head
bent
in
thought
then
she
said
something
very
sensible
last
summer
i
had
just
lost
my
livelihood
i
telling
you
things
exactly
as
they
were
i
lost
my
post
which
was
a
very
serious
matter
this
made
me
reflect
for
a
time
that
true
but
then
i
do
know
i
quite
adult
but
not
adult
enough
i
have
two
sisters
who
are
really
steady
they
married
and
quite
settled
though
they
younger
than
i
know
what
wrong
with
me
would
you
like
to
go
to
a
concert
with
me
i
asked
now
no
thank
you
i
not
dressed
for
it
a
pause
but
it
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
she
said
with
sudden
pleasure
it
might
have
been
very
nice
but
well
you
must
let
me
tell
you
about
the
dinner
party
the
banquet
what
a
lot
of
pranks
they
thought
of
she
was
right
about
that
these
jolly
young
people
had
played
a
great
many
pranks
some
of
them
childish
and
stupid
others
not
too
bad
first
they
had
drunk
wine
of
the
vintage
of
no
first
of
all
flaten
was
sent
an
invitation
of
course
and
it
consisted
of
a
painting
a
very
emancipated
painting
in
a
frame
the
only
written
words
being
the
date
and
the
place
and
the
legend
bachiads
offenbachiads
then
there
were
speeches
for
him
who
was
about
to
leave
them
and
generally
speaking
a
most
deafening
shouting
over
the
wineglasses
and
there
was
music
with
someone
of
the
company
playing
all
the
time
but
as
the
evening
wore
on
this
sort
of
thing
was
not
enough
and
girls
with
their
faces
masked
were
brought
in
to
dance
as
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
champagne
however
this
part
of
the
program
tended
to
deteriorate
into
something
different
and
the
girls
had
to
be
sent
away
then
the
gentlemen
went
down
to
the
hotel
lobby
and
stood
at
the
door
watching
for
opportunities
there
a
young
woman
approached
carrying
a
baby
and
a
bundle
of
clothes
great
wet
flakes
of
snow
were
drifting
down
and
she
bent
forward
over
the
child
to
shelter
it
as
she
walked
whoa
said
the
gentleman
and
caught
hold
of
her
is
that
your
child
yes
he
mine
what
a
boy
yes
they
talked
more
with
her
she
was
thin
and
young
evidently
a
servant
girl
they
also
looked
at
the
child
and
helgesen
and
lind
who
were
both
polished
their
glasses
and
inspected
it
carefully
are
you
going
off
to
drown
the
child
somebody
says
no
says
the
girl
in
confusion
that
was
a
nasty
question
all
the
others
agreed
and
the
first
one
admitted
it
he
went
off
to
fetch
his
raincoat
and
hung
it
over
the
girl
shoulders
then
he
tickled
the
child
under
the
chin
and
made
it
smile
a
marvel
of
a
child
human
bones
and
rags
and
dirt
all
in
one
little
bundle
poor
bastard
he
said
born
of
a
maiden
that
better
the
others
remarked
now
let
do
something
they
said
where
do
you
live
to
the
girl
i
lived
at
such
and
such
places
she
replied
lived
very
well
this
is
what
we
do
one
of
them
said
taking
out
his
pocketbook
the
others
followed
suit
and
a
great
deal
of
money
was
pushed
into
the
girl
hand
wait
a
minute
wait
i
have
given
her
enough
i
asked
her
such
a
nasty
question
said
the
first
of
them
neither
have
i
said
another
because
we
all
thought
the
same
thing
but
now
we
going
to
settle
some
money
on
this
son
of
a
maiden
a
collection
was
taken
up
with
helgesen
as
the
cashier
then
bengt
hailed
a
cab
invited
the
girl
to
enter
and
got
in
after
her
go
ahead
i
want
to
go
to
langes
street
he
called
to
the
driver
bengt
was
taking
the
child
home
to
his
mother
the
others
said
the
group
were
rather
silent
after
this
your
eyes
are
so
ridiculously
wet
bolt
are
you
crying
about
the
money
what
about
you
bolt
replied
you
as
sentimental
as
an
old
woman
they
grew
cheerful
again
and
there
were
further
opportunities
a
peasant
came
down
the
street
with
a
cow
he
was
taking
to
the
butcher
what
will
you
charge
for
letting
our
guest
of
honor
ride
your
cow
young
rolandsen
asked
him
the
peasant
smiled
and
shook
his
head
so
they
bought
the
cow
from
him
paying
cash
for
it
wait
a
minute
they
said
to
the
peasant
then
they
put
a
label
on
the
cow
addressed
to
a
lady
they
knew
take
it
to
this
address
they
said
to
the
peasant
by
the
time
they
had
finished
with
this
bengt
had
returned
where
have
been
they
asked
in
surprise
the
old
lady
said
yes
was
all
he
replied
hurrah
they
all
shouted
let
drink
to
the
baby
here
let
go
to
the
bar
did
she
really
say
yes
hurrah
for
the
old
lady
too
what
are
we
standing
here
for
let
walk
into
the
bar
walk
someone
mocks
no
indeed
we
cars
the
waiter
rushed
inside
to
telephone
it
took
some
time
as
it
was
getting
late
but
the
gentlemen
waited
it
was
already
closing
time
and
people
were
streaming
out
of
the
bar
at
length
the
cars
arrived
ten
of
them
one
for
each
man
the
gentlemen
entered
them
where
to
asked
the
drivers
next
door
they
said
so
the
cars
drove
up
to
the
next
door
of
the
same
house
that
being
the
bar
and
there
the
gentlemen
gravely
got
out
and
paid
the
drivers
the
bar
was
closed
shall
we
break
in
they
said
of
course
they
said
so
they
all
ran
against
the
door
together
till
it
said
and
flew
open
the
night
watchman
rushed
at
them
shouting
and
they
caught
hold
of
him
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
embraced
him
then
they
went
behind
the
counter
and
got
out
bottles
for
him
and
for
themselves
drinking
and
shouting
hurrah
for
the
baby
for
bengt
mother
for
the
baby
mother
for
the
night
watchman
for
love
and
for
life
when
they
had
done
they
put
some
banknotes
over
the
night
watchman
mouth
and
tied
a
handkerchief
over
them
then
they
went
back
to
the
dining
room
the
supper
was
served
flaten
plate
was
a
red
silk
bedroom
slipper
lined
with
glass
they
ate
and
drank
and
rollicked
as
long
as
they
had
the
strength
the
hours
passed
and
dawn
approached
then
flaten
began
to
distribute
souvenirs
among
them
one
got
his
watch
another
his
pocketbook
which
was
empty
a
third
his
tie
pin
after
this
he
went
on
to
his
shoes
giving
one
to
each
of
two
friends
his
trousers
to
another
and
his
shirt
to
still
another
till
at
length
he
sat
there
in
the
nude
next
they
collected
quilts
from
the
hotel
bedrooms
to
wrap
him
up
in
red
silk
eiderdown
quilts
flaten
fell
asleep
and
the
other
nine
watched
over
him
he
slept
for
an
hour
it
was
morning
then
and
they
woke
him
up
he
started
up
from
the
quilts
found
he
was
naked
and
sent
home
for
some
more
clothes
and
then
the
party
began
all
over
again
later
we
were
discussing
miss
torsen
story
she
had
forgotten
one
or
two
details
which
she
filled
in
afterwards
anyhow
it
was
lucky
for
the
girl
with
the
baby
she
said
and
for
the
baby
itself
i
said
yes
but
what
an
idea
poor
old
lady
to
be
told
such
a
tale
some
day
perhaps
you
change
your
mind
about
that
you
think
so
but
it
would
have
been
nicer
still
if
i
got
the
money
they
settled
on
the
child
you
change
your
mind
about
that
too
shall
i
why
when
when
you
yourself
have
a
baby
that
smiles
at
you
ugh
how
can
you
say
such
things
she
must
have
misunderstood
my
meaning
for
she
was
childishly
offended
to
restore
her
to
good
humor
i
asked
at
random
what
sort
of
food
did
you
get
at
the
party
do
know
she
replied
do
you
know
good
lord
no
i
was
there
she
returned
in
the
greatest
amazement
well
no
of
course
not
i
only
thought
oh
so
that
it
that
what
you
thought
she
said
still
more
offended
and
she
clasped
her
hands
as
she
had
done
in
the
summer
and
tore
them
apart
again
really
and
truly
i
do
assure
you
look
here
honestly
i
only
thought
you
were
taking
a
culinary
interest
after
all
you
do
learn
cooking
and
such
in
the
daytime
oh
so
you
just
make
conversation
with
me
you
adapt
your
speech
to
suit
my
narrow
outlook
a
pause
anyhow
perhaps
you
right
up
to
a
point
i
might
have
asked
about
the
food
only
i
forgot
she
seemed
very
irritable
that
evening
would
it
interest
her
to
talk
about
flaten
a
little
apprehensively
i
ventured
but
you
have
told
me
whom
flaten
is
going
to
marry
she
not
pretty
at
all
she
replied
suddenly
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
you
do
know
her
i
suppose
flaten
will
be
entering
his
father
firm
now
i
persisted
oh
damn
flaten
you
seem
to
care
about
him
a
lot
more
than
i
do
flaten
flaten
flaten
how
should
i
know
if
he
going
to
enter
his
firm
i
only
thought
once
he
married
but
she
got
money
too
no
i
do
think
he
going
into
his
firm
he
said
once
he
wanted
to
edit
a
paper
well
what
so
funny
about
that
i
not
laughing
yes
you
were
anyhow
flaten
wants
to
edit
a
paper
and
since
lind
publishes
a
kennel
journal
flaten
wants
to
publish
a
human
journal
he
says
a
human
journal
yes
and
you
ought
to
subscribe
to
it
she
added
suddenly
almost
throwing
the
words
into
my
face
she
was
now
in
a
state
of
excitement
the
cause
of
which
i
did
not
understand
so
i
remained
silent
merely
replying
ought
i
yes
perhaps
i
ought
then
she
began
to
cry
dear
child
do
cry
i
sha
torment
you
any
more
you
not
tormenting
me
yes
by
talking
nonsense
i
do
seem
to
strike
the
right
note
yes
go
on
talking
that
is
it
i
do
know
what
could
i
say
to
her
but
since
there
is
after
all
nothing
so
interesting
as
a
question
about
oneself
i
said
you
nervous
about
something
but
it
will
pass
perhaps
well
not
at
once
of
course
but
perhaps
it
has
hurt
you
that
well
that
he
going
his
own
way
now
but
remember
you
wrong
she
said
shaking
her
head
that
does
really
mean
anything
to
me
i
was
just
slightly
attracted
to
him
but
you
said
he
was
the
only
one
oh
you
know
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
sometimes
of
course
i
been
in
love
with
other
people
too
i
ca
deny
that
flaten
was
very
nice
and
took
me
out
driving
sometimes
or
to
a
dance
or
something
like
that
and
of
course
i
was
proud
of
his
paying
attention
to
me
in
spite
of
my
having
lost
my
post
i
think
i
could
have
got
a
job
in
his
father
shop
but
anyhow
i
looking
for
a
job
now
are
you
i
hope
you
find
a
good
one
that
just
the
point
but
i
not
getting
any
job
at
all
that
is
i
shall
in
the
end
of
course
but
well
for
instance
in
old
shop
i
should
fit
in
there
not
very
good
pay
either
i
expect
i
sure
it
not
and
then
i
do
know
i
feel
i
know
too
much
for
it
that
wretched
academic
training
of
mine
does
nothing
but
harm
oh
well
let
not
talk
any
more
about
me
it
must
be
late
i
better
go
i
saw
her
to
her
door
said
good
night
and
went
home
i
thought
about
her
ceaselessly
it
was
wintry
weather
with
raw
streets
and
an
invisible
sky
no
really
she
not
suited
for
marriage
no
man
is
served
with
a
wife
who
is
nothing
but
a
student
why
has
no
one
in
the
country
noticed
what
the
young
women
are
coming
to
miss
torsen
tale
of
the
wild
party
proved
how
accustomed
she
was
to
sitting
and
listening
and
then
herself
disgorging
endless
tales
she
had
done
it
very
well
and
not
omitted
much
but
she
paid
attention
only
to
the
fun
a
eternal
schoolgirl
one
who
had
studied
her
life
away
when
i
reached
my
own
door
miss
torsen
arrived
there
at
the
same
time
she
had
been
close
at
my
heels
all
the
way
i
guessed
this
from
the
fact
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
breathless
as
she
spoke
i
forgot
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
she
said
my
dear
girl
oh
for
saying
what
i
did
you
must
subscribe
i
so
sorry
about
that
please
be
kind
and
forgive
me
she
took
my
hand
and
shook
it
in
my
amazement
i
stammered
it
was
really
a
very
witty
remark
a
human
journal
ha
ha
now
stand
there
and
get
cold
put
your
gloves
on
again
are
you
walking
back
yes
good
night
forgive
me
for
the
whole
evening
let
me
take
you
home
why
not
stay
a
few
minutes
no
thank
you
she
pressed
my
hand
firmly
and
left
me
i
suppose
she
wanted
to
spare
my
aging
legs
damn
them
nevertheless
i
stole
after
her
to
see
that
she
got
home
safely
it
happened
that
josephine
came
to
the
town
josephine
that
spirit
of
labor
from
the
tore
peak
farm
i
saw
her
too
for
she
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
she
had
looked
up
my
address
and
i
joked
with
her
again
and
called
her
joséfriendly
how
was
everybody
at
tore
peak
josephine
had
good
news
about
all
of
them
but
she
shook
her
head
over
paul
not
that
he
drank
much
now
but
he
did
little
of
anything
else
either
and
had
definitely
lost
interest
in
his
work
he
wanted
to
sell
the
farm
he
wanted
to
try
carting
and
delivery
by
horse
cart
in
stordalen
i
asked
if
he
had
any
prospective
purchaser
yes
einar
one
of
the
cotters
had
had
rather
an
eye
on
the
farm
it
all
depended
on
manufacturer
brede
who
had
put
so
much
money
into
it
i
remembered
her
father
the
old
man
from
another
world
the
man
with
mittens
who
had
to
be
on
porridge
because
he
was
ninety
who
smelled
like
an
unburied
corpse
i
remembered
him
and
asked
josephine
well
i
expect
your
old
father
is
dead
by
now
no
praise
be
she
replied
father
is
better
than
we
dared
hope
we
must
be
thankful
he
still
on
his
feet
i
took
josephine
to
the
cinema
and
the
circus
and
she
thought
it
all
quite
delightful
but
she
was
shocked
at
the
behavior
of
the
ladies
who
rode
with
so
little
clothing
on
she
wanted
to
go
to
one
of
the
great
churches
too
and
found
her
way
there
alone
for
several
days
she
was
in
the
town
and
did
a
good
deal
of
shopping
i
never
once
saw
her
dejected
or
brooding
about
anything
and
at
length
she
said
because
she
was
going
back
next
day
oh
so
she
was
going
home
yes
she
had
done
what
she
had
come
to
do
she
had
also
been
to
see
miss
torsen
and
got
the
money
for
the
actor
because
of
course
he
had
never
sent
it
poor
miss
torsen
she
was
furious
with
him
for
not
sending
it
and
turned
quite
red
and
ashamed
too
she
did
seem
to
find
it
very
easy
either
because
she
asked
me
to
wait
till
next
day
but
she
gave
it
to
me
then
so
josephine
had
nothing
more
to
do
in
the
town
she
had
just
visited
miss
palm
but
she
had
not
on
this
occasion
met
miss
palm
brother
nikolai
who
was
apprenticed
to
a
master
carpenter
not
that
it
mattered
josephine
said
because
the
last
time
she
had
seen
him
nothing
came
of
it
anyhow
so
that
was
that
because
she
was
not
a
one
to
beg
she
had
some
money
of
her
own
and
livestock
as
well
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
she
had
some
woolen
blankets
and
two
beds
complete
with
bedding
too
nor
did
she
lack
clothes
she
had
many
changes
both
underthings
and
top
ones
yet
in
spite
of
that
she
had
started
some
more
weaving
i
asked
in
some
surprise
whether
they
had
been
engaged
i
had
had
no
inkling
no
but
well
not
exactly
engaged
with
a
ring
and
plighting
the
troth
and
all
but
that
had
been
their
intention
because
otherwise
why
should
that
schoolmistress
that
sister
of
his
sophie
palm
have
come
up
and
stayed
for
nothing
at
the
tore
peak
farm
for
two
whole
summers
and
behaved
as
though
she
were
a
lady
no
thank
you
that
was
the
end
of
that
anyhow
that
was
what
she
josephine
had
thought
once
but
it
was
a
providence
that
it
was
going
to
happen
because
there
would
never
have
been
anything
but
trouble
so
it
was
just
as
well
suddenly
josephine
caught
herself
up
good
gracious
i
nearly
forgot
to
buy
the
indigo
it
for
my
weaving
lucky
i
remembered
it
well
thanks
for
your
hospitality
xxxiv
it
was
between
christmas
and
the
new
year
and
i
had
accompanied
nikolai
to
his
home
since
the
town
workshop
was
closed
in
any
case
he
had
decided
to
go
home
and
fell
timber
in
the
woods
it
was
a
big
farmhouse
enlarged
from
the
old
cottage
by
nikolai
father
while
nikolai
himself
had
moved
up
the
roof
and
built
on
a
second
story
he
has
plenty
of
room
for
me
i
have
a
small
room
to
myself
his
mother
is
and
honest
she
has
a
few
animals
to
see
to
and
usually
she
is
washing
something
or
other
even
if
it
is
nothing
more
than
some
empty
potato
sacks
she
cooks
on
the
kitchen
stove
and
keeps
her
pots
and
pans
shining
she
is
cleanly
and
strains
her
milk
through
a
muslin
cloth
which
she
afterward
washes
and
rinses
twice
but
she
picks
food
remnants
from
between
the
prongs
of
forks
with
a
hairpin
a
mirror
pictures
of
the
german
kaiser
family
and
a
crucifix
hang
on
the
walls
of
the
living
room
in
one
corner
are
two
shelves
with
oddments
including
a
hymnbook
and
a
book
of
sermons
they
are
still
simple
and
orthodox
in
these
parts
the
rest
of
the
furniture
in
the
house
the
chairs
and
tables
and
cupboards
and
a
cleverly
constructed
chest
have
all
been
made
by
nikolai
himself
nikolai
is
just
as
slow
and
speechless
here
as
in
the
town
the
day
after
we
arrived
he
went
out
to
the
woods
without
telling
his
mother
when
i
asked
for
him
she
said
i
saw
him
take
the
sleigh
so
i
expect
he
gone
to
the
woods
his
mother
name
is
petra
and
judging
from
her
appearance
she
can
not
be
much
over
forty
like
her
son
she
is
ruddy
and
with
a
fair
complexion
and
thick
graying
hair
a
veritable
lion
mane
her
eyes
are
good
companions
to
her
hair
dark
and
a
little
worn
now
but
still
good
enough
to
see
far
and
sharply
across
the
fjord
she
too
is
taciturn
like
all
the
peasants
here
and
usually
keeps
her
large
mouth
shut
i
ask
her
how
long
she
has
been
a
widow
and
she
says
for
nearly
a
generation
no
do
let
me
tell
a
lie
she
corrects
herself
sophie
is
four
and
twenty
now
and
it
was
the
year
after
her
birth
that
he
died
they
had
only
been
married
a
couple
of
years
nikolai
is
six
and
twenty
i
ponder
over
this
arithmetic
but
as
i
am
old
and
incapable
i
can
not
make
it
tally
petra
was
very
proud
of
her
children
especially
sophie
who
had
gone
to
school
and
passed
an
examination
and
now
held
such
an
important
post
of
course
her
inheritance
was
used
up
but
she
had
her
learning
instead
nobody
could
ever
take
that
from
her
a
big
handsome
girl
sophie
look
here
is
her
portrait
i
said
i
had
met
her
at
tore
peak
at
tore
peak
oh
yes
she
spent
her
summers
there
so
as
to
be
among
her
equals
you
could
blame
her
for
that
but
she
came
home
every
year
too
as
sure
as
the
year
came
round
itself
so
i
had
met
her
at
tore
peak
sometimes
i
went
with
nikolai
to
the
forest
for
timber
and
made
myself
slightly
useful
he
is
as
strong
as
an
ox
and
has
endurance
almost
to
the
point
of
insensibility
a
cut
black
eye
nothing
and
now
it
becomes
evident
that
his
brain
works
well
too
he
should
have
had
a
horse
yes
but
he
can
not
keep
a
horse
till
he
can
provide
more
fodder
but
he
can
not
buy
more
pasture
land
till
he
has
more
money
but
he
was
learning
more
about
his
trade
in
the
town
and
when
he
had
finished
his
course
of
training
he
would
earn
more
money
after
that
he
would
buy
a
horse
i
visited
the
neighbors
too
the
farms
were
small
but
the
farmers
cultivated
as
much
land
as
they
required
and
there
was
no
poverty
here
were
no
flowerpots
in
the
windows
or
pictures
on
the
walls
as
at
petra
but
good
thick
furs
with
woven
backs
hung
over
the
doors
and
the
children
looked
healthy
and
the
neighbors
all
knew
i
lived
at
petra
house
every
visitor
to
this
district
lived
at
petra
house
had
done
so
as
long
as
they
could
remember
i
could
sense
no
hostility
to
petra
in
these
silent
people
but
the
old
schoolmaster
was
more
talkative
and
he
was
quite
ready
to
spread
gossip
about
her
this
man
was
a
bachelor
he
had
his
own
house
and
did
his
own
housework
had
he
perhaps
at
some
time
felt
a
secret
desire
for
the
widow
petra
the
schoolmaster
gossiped
thus
people
who
had
visited
the
village
in
petra
girlhood
always
used
to
live
at
her
parents
house
there
was
a
room
and
a
loft
and
the
engineer
that
planned
the
big
road
lived
there
and
so
did
the
two
traveling
preachers
to
say
nothing
of
the
itinerant
peddlers
who
toured
the
district
all
the
year
round
so
it
went
on
for
many
a
year
with
the
children
growing
up
and
petra
getting
big
and
hearty
then
palm
came
he
was
a
swede
a
big
merchant
a
wholesale
merchant
one
might
almost
say
for
that
period
with
his
own
boat
and
even
a
boy
to
carry
his
wares
well
there
were
glass
panes
again
in
the
windows
of
petra
parents
house
and
there
was
meat
on
sundays
for
palm
liked
things
done
in
style
he
gave
petra
presents
of
dress
materials
and
sweets
then
he
was
finished
with
petra
and
went
away
to
do
business
elsewhere
but
it
happened
that
the
child
petra
gave
birth
to
was
a
boy
and
when
palm
returned
and
saw
him
he
stayed
and
traveled
no
more
they
married
and
palm
added
two
rooms
to
the
house
for
it
was
his
intention
to
open
a
shop
there
but
when
he
had
built
honestly
and
well
he
died
his
widow
was
left
with
two
small
children
but
she
had
means
enough
for
palm
had
had
plenty
of
money
then
why
did
not
petra
remarry
she
could
have
got
a
man
in
spite
of
the
handicap
of
two
small
children
for
petra
herself
was
still
a
young
girl
but
from
her
childhood
days
said
the
schoolmaster
she
had
been
spoiled
by
this
love
of
roving
company
and
again
housed
itinerant
tramps
and
swedes
and
peddlers
and
thoroughly
disgraced
herself
some
of
them
stayed
there
for
weeks
eating
and
drinking
and
idling
it
was
shameful
her
parents
saw
nothing
wrong
in
this
because
it
had
always
been
their
way
of
living
and
besides
it
brought
them
a
little
money
so
the
years
went
by
when
the
children
were
grown
and
sophie
was
out
of
the
way
she
might
have
married
even
then
for
she
still
had
half
her
money
left
and
being
childless
again
it
was
not
too
late
but
no
petra
did
want
to
and
it
too
late
she
said
it
was
the
children
turn
to
marry
now
she
said
well
she
pretty
old
now
is
she
i
said
yes
time
passes
the
schoolmaster
replied
i
do
know
whether
anyone
has
asked
her
this
year
but
last
year
there
was
someone
one
person
or
so
i
heard
so
i
been
told
but
petra
did
want
to
if
i
could
only
guess
what
she
waiting
for
perhaps
she
not
waiting
at
all
well
it
all
the
same
to
me
says
the
schoolmaster
but
she
takes
in
all
these
tramps
and
peddlers
and
carries
on
and
makes
a
public
nuisance
of
herself
as
i
walked
home
from
the
schoolmaster
i
found
i
understood
arithmetic
much
better
nikolai
has
gone
back
to
his
workshop
in
the
town
but
i
have
remained
behind
it
matters
little
where
i
am
for
the
winter
makes
a
dead
man
of
me
in
any
case
to
pass
the
time
i
carefully
measure
the
piece
of
land
that
nikolai
is
going
to
break
up
when
he
can
afford
it
and
i
calculate
what
it
will
cost
him
with
drainage
and
everything
a
bare
two
hundred
then
he
could
keep
a
horse
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
charity
to
give
him
this
money
in
case
his
mother
could
not
he
could
have
added
another
field
to
his
land
then
look
here
petra
why
do
you
give
nikolai
the
two
hundred
he
needs
for
fodder
for
a
horse
and
four
hundred
to
buy
the
horse
she
muttered
that
makes
six
i
have
got
such
a
lot
of
six
hundred
lying
about
but
would
the
horse
be
useful
for
plowing
a
pause
then
he
can
break
the
ground
himself
i
was
not
unfamiliar
with
this
line
of
reasoning
everyone
has
his
own
problems
and
petra
had
hers
but
the
strange
thing
is
that
each
one
of
us
struggles
for
himself
as
though
he
had
a
hundred
years
to
live
i
once
knew
two
brothers
named
martinsen
who
owned
a
large
farm
the
produce
of
which
they
sold
both
were
bachelors
without
heirs
but
both
had
diseased
lungs
the
younger
brother
much
worse
than
the
elder
in
the
spring
the
younger
brother
became
permanently
bedridden
but
though
he
approached
his
end
he
still
maintained
an
interest
in
everything
that
went
on
at
the
farm
he
heard
strangers
talking
in
the
kitchen
and
called
his
brother
in
what
is
it
he
asked
only
someone
to
buy
eggs
what
the
price
per
score
now
his
brother
told
him
then
give
him
the
small
eggs
he
cautioned
a
few
days
later
he
was
dead
his
brother
lived
till
his
year
though
his
lungs
were
diseased
when
anybody
came
to
buy
eggs
he
always
gave
him
the
smallest
but
i
insisted
to
petra
nikolai
does
want
to
waste
time
breaking
his
ground
himself
does
he
surely
if
he
works
at
his
trade
he
earn
more
they
do
pay
for
joinery
here
petra
replied
people
buy
their
chairs
and
tables
from
the
shops
now
it
cheaper
then
why
is
nikolai
working
as
an
apprentice
i
asked
him
the
same
question
she
replied
nikolai
just
wants
to
be
a
carpenter
but
it
wo
get
him
anywhere
still
he
can
do
as
he
likes
well
what
else
could
he
do
a
pause
petra
big
mouth
is
closed
but
at
length
she
says
there
plenty
of
traffic
now
and
a
lot
of
tourists
in
the
summer
both
at
tore
peak
and
down
here
on
the
headland
one
time
we
had
two
danes
living
here
they
had
traveled
on
foot
you
had
a
horse
you
could
have
driven
us
here
they
said
to
me
ah
i
thought
to
myself
the
cat
sticking
its
nose
out
of
the
bag
got
a
big
house
and
four
rooms
the
danes
said
and
are
high
mountains
and
big
woods
they
said
fish
in
the
fjord
and
fish
in
the
river
there
are
lots
of
things
here
and
there
a
broad
road
here
they
said
nikolai
was
standing
next
to
them
and
heard
it
all
too
we
here
they
said
we
ca
get
away
again
unless
we
walk
just
to
say
something
i
asked
her
four
rooms
i
thought
you
only
had
three
yes
but
the
workshop
could
be
turned
into
a
room
too
the
big
mouth
replied
so
that
it
i
thought
with
hardly
a
pause
i
continued
but
if
nikolai
were
going
to
deal
with
tourists
he
have
to
get
a
horse
would
he
well
i
suppose
we
could
have
managed
it
petra
replied
it
four
hundred
yes
she
said
and
the
carriage
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
this
land
wo
feed
a
horse
what
do
other
people
feed
horses
on
she
asked
they
buy
sacks
of
oats
on
the
headland
that
eighteen
a
sack
no
seventeen
and
you
earn
as
much
as
that
on
your
first
tourist
yes
petra
had
it
all
figured
out
she
was
the
born
landlady
and
had
grown
up
in
a
lodginghouse
she
could
cook
too
for
had
she
not
put
two
snakes
of
italian
macaroni
in
the
barley
broth
the
money
for
coffee
for
the
bed
at
night
and
waffles
in
the
morning
had
grown
so
dear
to
her
that
she
hid
it
away
watched
it
increase
and
grew
rich
on
it
she
did
not
produce
like
other
peasant
women
but
no
one
can
do
everything
at
one
time
and
petra
was
a
parasite
she
did
not
want
to
live
by
earning
something
she
wanted
to
live
on
the
tourists
who
earned
enough
themselves
and
could
afford
to
come
splendor
and
englishmen
no
doubt
in
these
parts
if
it
all
works
out
as
it
should
and
it
probably
will
it
is
february
i
have
an
idea
a
vagrant
idea
that
comes
to
me
and
i
harbor
it
now
that
there
is
a
little
snow
and
its
crust
is
hard
i
shall
walk
across
the
fields
into
sweden
that
is
what
i
shall
do
but
before
i
can
do
it
i
must
wait
for
my
laundry
and
petra
who
is
cleanly
washes
in
many
waters
so
i
pass
the
time
in
nikolai
workshop
where
there
are
many
kinds
of
planes
and
saws
and
drills
and
lathes
and
there
i
fashion
strange
things
for
the
small
boys
of
the
neighboring
farm
i
make
a
windmill
that
will
really
turn
in
the
wind
it
whirls
and
rattles
well
and
i
remember
my
own
childhood
when
we
called
this
apparatus
onomatopoeically
a
besides
this
i
go
out
walking
and
use
my
winter
head
as
well
as
i
can
which
is
not
very
well
i
do
not
blame
the
winter
nor
do
i
blame
anything
but
where
are
the
irons
and
the
youth
of
omnipotence
for
hours
sometimes
i
walk
along
a
path
in
the
woods
with
my
hands
folded
on
my
back
an
old
man
my
mind
gilded
for
a
moment
by
an
occasional
memory
i
stop
and
raise
my
eyebrows
in
surprise
can
this
be
an
iron
in
the
fire
it
is
not
for
it
fades
again
and
i
am
left
behind
in
a
quiet
melancholy
but
in
order
to
recall
my
young
days
i
pretend
to
be
filled
with
a
energy
it
is
by
no
means
all
pretense
and
pictures
rise
in
my
mind
fragmentary
flageolet
tones
we
came
from
the
meadow
and
downy
heather
we
came
from
friendship
a
star
that
watched
saw
lips
meet
lips
none
else
so
dear
so
sweet
as
you
those
youthful
days
those
happy
days
unmatched
since
then
but
what
am
i
now
the
bees
once
swarmed
the
swan
once
played
there
no
play
now
yet
i
break
off
and
put
the
pencil
in
my
pocket
with
a
tone
still
resounding
within
me
i
walk
on
with
some
pleasure
to
myself
at
least
there
is
a
letter
for
me
who
on
earth
has
found
me
out
here
the
letter
is
as
follows
forgive
me
for
writing
you
but
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
something
that
has
happened
i
should
like
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
come
back
there
nothing
the
matter
please
do
say
no
yours
ingeborg
torsen
i
reread
it
many
times
something
that
has
happened
but
i
going
to
sweden
i
going
to
move
about
a
little
and
stop
losing
myself
in
the
affairs
of
others
do
they
think
i
am
mankind
old
uncle
that
i
can
be
summoned
hither
and
thither
to
give
advice
excuse
me
but
i
am
going
to
assert
myself
and
become
quite
inaccessible
the
snow
is
just
right
and
i
have
planned
a
big
journey
a
business
tour
i
might
almost
call
it
very
important
to
me
i
have
a
great
deal
at
stake
how
composite
is
the
mind
of
man
as
i
sit
talking
drivel
to
myself
and
even
sometimes
saying
an
angry
word
aloud
in
order
that
petra
may
hear
it
i
am
not
at
all
displeased
at
having
received
this
letter
in
fact
secretly
i
am
so
pleased
that
i
feel
ashamed
it
is
merely
because
i
shall
soon
see
the
town
again
the
town
with
its
frostbitten
gardens
and
its
ships
but
what
on
earth
can
this
mean
has
she
been
to
my
landlady
and
got
my
address
or
has
she
met
nikolai
i
left
at
once
xxxv
my
landlady
was
surprised
why
good
evening
how
well
and
happy
you
look
here
your
mail
let
it
lie
i
must
tell
you
madame
henriksen
that
you
are
a
jewel
ha
ha
ha
yes
you
are
you
are
a
very
kind
woman
but
you
have
given
my
address
to
someone
no
indeed
i
swear
i
have
no
well
then
someone
else
must
have
done
so
yes
you
right
i
am
happy
and
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
get
up
very
early
and
walk
down
by
the
shore
but
i
did
send
a
message
said
my
landlady
i
hope
it
was
wrong
of
me
to
a
lady
who
wanted
to
know
as
soon
as
you
arrived
a
lady
you
sent
a
message
just
now
a
little
while
ago
as
soon
as
you
came
in
a
young
handsome
lady
she
might
have
been
your
daughter
you
know
thank
you
well
i
only
saying
what
so
she
said
she
would
come
at
once
because
she
had
to
see
you
about
something
the
landlady
left
me
so
miss
torsen
was
coming
this
very
evening
something
must
have
happened
she
had
never
visited
me
before
i
looked
round
yes
everything
was
neat
and
tidy
i
washed
and
made
myself
ready
there
she
can
have
that
chair
i
better
light
the
other
lamp
too
it
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
sit
down
to
my
correspondence
that
would
make
a
good
impression
and
if
i
put
some
letters
in
a
small
feminine
hand
on
top
it
might
even
make
her
a
little
jealous
hee
hee
oh
god
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
one
could
play
such
tricks
it
too
late
now
then
she
knocked
and
came
in
i
made
no
move
to
shake
hands
and
neither
did
she
i
merely
drew
out
a
chair
for
her
excuse
my
coming
like
this
she
said
i
asked
henriksen
to
send
me
a
message
it
nothing
serious
and
now
i
feel
a
little
embarrassed
about
it
but
i
saw
that
it
was
something
serious
and
my
heart
began
to
pound
why
should
my
heart
be
affected
this
is
the
first
time
you
been
in
my
rooms
i
said
expectant
and
on
the
defensive
yes
it
very
nice
she
said
without
looking
round
she
began
to
clasp
her
hands
and
pull
them
apart
again
till
the
tips
of
her
gloves
projected
beyond
her
finger
tips
she
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
perhaps
i
done
something
you
approve
of
she
said
suddenly
pulling
off
her
glove
she
had
a
ring
on
her
finger
good
i
said
it
did
affect
me
immediately
i
was
to
understand
more
later
and
merely
asked
are
you
engaged
yes
she
replied
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
though
her
mouth
shook
i
looked
back
at
her
and
i
believe
i
said
something
like
well
now
well
well
then
i
nodded
in
a
fatherly
fashion
bowed
formally
and
said
my
heartiest
congratulations
yes
that
what
it
come
to
she
said
i
think
it
was
the
best
thing
to
do
perhaps
you
think
it
a
bit
unreliable
of
me
or
rash
or
well
do
you
oh
i
do
know
but
it
was
absolutely
the
best
thing
and
i
just
thought
i
tell
you
i
got
up
she
started
evidently
in
a
very
nervous
state
but
i
had
only
risen
to
turn
down
the
lamp
behind
her
which
had
begun
to
smoke
a
pause
she
said
nothing
more
so
what
could
i
say
but
as
the
minutes
passed
and
i
saw
she
was
distressed
i
said
why
did
you
want
to
tell
me
this
yes
why
did
i
perhaps
for
a
moment
you
thought
you
were
the
center
of
the
world
again
but
yes
i
expect
so
she
looked
about
her
with
great
roving
eyes
then
she
got
up
she
had
been
sitting
all
this
time
as
though
about
to
spring
at
me
i
rose
too
an
unhappy
woman
i
saw
that
plainly
enough
but
good
heavens
what
could
i
do
she
had
come
to
tell
me
she
was
engaged
and
at
the
same
time
looked
very
unhappy
was
that
a
way
to
behave
but
as
she
got
up
i
could
see
her
face
better
under
her
hat
i
could
see
her
hair
the
hair
that
was
beginning
to
show
silken
and
silver
at
the
temples
how
beautiful
it
was
she
was
tall
and
handsome
and
her
breast
was
rising
and
falling
her
great
breast
what
a
great
breast
she
had
rising
and
falling
her
face
was
brown
and
her
mouth
open
just
a
little
open
dry
feverishly
dry
miss
ingeborg
it
was
the
first
time
i
called
her
this
and
i
moved
my
hand
toward
her
slightly
longing
to
touch
her
perhaps
to
fondle
her
i
do
know
but
she
had
collected
herself
now
and
stood
erect
and
hard
her
eyes
had
grown
cold
they
looked
at
me
putting
me
in
my
place
again
as
she
walked
toward
the
door
a
cry
of
no
escaped
me
what
the
matter
she
asked
do
go
not
yet
not
at
once
sit
down
again
and
talk
to
me
more
no
you
quite
right
she
said
i
not
the
center
of
the
universe
here
i
come
to
bother
you
with
my
unimportant
troubles
and
you
well
of
course
you
busy
with
your
extensive
correspondence
look
here
sit
down
again
wo
you
i
sha
even
read
the
letters
they
nothing
only
two
or
three
letters
perhaps
probably
from
complete
strangers
now
sit
down
tell
me
everything
you
owe
me
that
much
look
i
sha
even
read
the
letters
and
with
that
i
swept
them
up
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
oh
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
and
ran
to
the
fireplace
trying
to
save
them
do
bother
i
said
i
expect
no
happiness
to
come
to
me
through
the
post
and
sorrows
i
do
not
seek
she
stood
so
close
to
me
that
i
found
myself
again
on
the
point
of
touching
her
just
for
a
moment
touching
her
arm
but
i
caught
myself
in
time
i
had
already
gone
too
far
so
i
said
as
gently
and
sympathetically
as
i
could
dear
child
you
must
not
be
unhappy
it
will
all
turn
out
for
the
best
you
see
now
sit
down
there
that
better
no
doubt
she
had
been
taken
aback
by
my
violence
for
she
sank
into
her
chair
almost
absently
i
not
unhappy
she
said
are
you
so
much
the
better
i
began
to
chatter
away
at
top
speed
though
i
tried
to
restrain
myself
to
show
that
i
was
nothing
more
than
an
uncle
to
her
i
talked
to
distract
her
to
distract
us
both
i
let
my
tongue
wag
i
could
hear
it
buzzing
what
could
i
say
a
little
of
everything
a
great
deal
in
fact
well
well
child
and
whom
are
you
marrying
who
is
the
lucky
man
nice
of
you
to
come
and
tell
me
before
anyone
really
very
nice
thank
you
very
much
you
see
i
only
just
come
home
and
i
have
slept
much
on
the
journey
i
was
anxious
to
know
well
perhaps
not
anxious
exactly
but
still
you
know
what
such
a
homecoming
is
lots
of
people
noise
brr
i
hardly
got
any
sleep
then
i
came
home
and
then
you
came
along
thank
you
for
coming
miss
ingeborg
i
might
be
your
father
and
you
just
a
child
that
why
i
say
but
when
you
told
me
all
this
i
had
had
any
sleep
i
was
quite
balanced
not
enough
to
give
you
advice
i
mean
i
had
quite
appreciated
but
now
you
can
quite
safely
i
like
to
know
of
course
is
he
old
is
he
young
young
of
course
i
am
imagining
what
will
happen
to
you
now
miss
ingeborg
in
your
new
condition
i
mean
it
will
be
so
entirely
different
from
what
you
been
accustomed
to
but
god
bless
you
it
will
all
turn
out
for
the
best
i
sure
of
that
but
you
do
even
know
who
it
is
she
interrupted
looking
at
me
apprehensively
again
no
i
do
and
i
need
if
you
rather
not
tell
me
yet
who
is
it
a
dapper
little
man
i
can
see
that
from
his
ring
a
schoolmaster
perhaps
a
clever
young
schoolmaster
she
shook
her
head
then
a
big
man
who
wants
to
dance
with
you
yes
perhaps
she
said
slowly
there
you
are
you
see
i
guessed
it
a
bear
who
will
carry
you
on
his
paws
on
your
birthday
do
you
know
what
he
give
you
for
your
birthday
but
perhaps
i
was
getting
too
childish
i
bored
her
and
for
the
first
time
she
looked
away
from
me
looked
at
a
picture
on
the
wall
then
at
another
picture
but
it
was
not
easy
for
me
to
stop
now
after
having
spoken
hardly
at
all
for
several
weeks
and
feeling
profoundly
excited
besides
heaven
only
knows
why
how
did
you
like
the
country
she
asked
suddenly
as
i
could
not
see
the
drift
of
this
question
i
merely
looked
at
her
were
you
at
nikolai
mother
house
she
persisted
yes
what
is
she
like
are
you
interested
in
her
no
i
do
suppose
so
oh
dear
she
sighed
wearily
come
come
you
must
sound
like
that
when
you
newly
engaged
what
the
country
was
like
well
there
was
a
schoolmaster
you
know
an
old
bachelor
sly
and
amusing
said
he
knew
me
and
put
on
the
most
extraordinary
airs
the
first
day
and
of
course
i
returned
the
compliment
and
said
i
had
come
exclusively
to
meet
him
he
said
should
it
be
i
said
years
a
schoolmaster
a
respected
man
permanent
churchman
chairman
indispensable
everywhere
well
then
i
attended
his
class
most
impressive
he
talked
continually
for
once
he
had
an
audience
almost
like
a
school
inspection
there
peter
ahem
he
said
was
a
horse
and
a
man
and
one
of
them
was
riding
on
the
other
back
which
one
was
riding
peter
man
peter
replies
a
pause
maybe
you
right
peter
maybe
the
man
was
riding
just
like
sin
like
the
devil
riding
us
but
she
was
looking
at
the
wall
again
drifting
away
from
me
again
i
changed
the
subject
clumsily
of
course
you
rather
hear
about
people
you
know
about
tore
peak
for
instance
josephine
has
been
in
town
yes
i
know
she
said
nodding
her
head
remember
the
old
man
at
tore
peak
i
do
think
i
ever
forget
him
in
a
certain
number
of
years
i
shall
be
like
him
perhaps
not
quite
so
old
then
i
shall
be
a
child
again
with
age
one
day
he
came
out
and
went
down
to
the
field
i
saw
him
he
had
mittens
on
you
know
he
eats
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
saw
him
lie
down
and
eat
the
hay
she
stared
at
me
foolishly
but
i
must
say
he
did
look
as
though
he
had
ever
eaten
hay
before
possibly
because
it
was
rotting
it
was
the
hay
that
had
been
left
you
know
rotting
down
for
next
year
for
the
next
tourist
year
you
seem
to
think
she
said
smiling
that
you
have
to
cheer
me
up
because
i
terribly
unhappy
i
quite
the
reverse
perhaps
he
too
good
for
me
that
what
his
sister
seems
to
think
anyhow
because
she
tried
to
stop
it
but
i
going
to
enjoy
snubbing
that
sister
of
his
anyhow
i
not
unhappy
and
that
is
the
reason
i
come
i
really
much
rather
have
him
than
anyone
else
since
i
ca
get
the
one
i
really
want
you
told
me
this
before
child
last
winter
in
fact
but
the
man
you
want
has
gone
his
way
besides
you
said
yourself
that
you
did
belong
with
him
or
rather
that
he
did
with
you
i
mean
belong
do
i
belong
anywhere
do
you
think
i
belong
in
the
place
going
to
now
i
afraid
i
not
really
suitable
for
anybody
at
least
i
ca
think
of
anyone
i
suit
i
wonder
how
i
manage
i
wonder
if
he
be
able
to
stand
me
but
i
do
my
very
best
i
made
up
my
mind
to
that
well
who
is
it
do
i
know
him
of
course
you
suit
each
other
i
believe
you
do
he
must
be
in
love
with
you
quite
madly
in
love
and
you
must
love
him
in
return
i
sure
you
come
through
with
flying
colors
miss
ingeborg
because
you
capable
and
intelligent
oh
well
she
said
rising
suddenly
to
her
feet
but
she
hesitated
over
something
and
seemed
about
to
speak
then
changed
her
mind
again
at
the
door
she
stood
with
her
back
to
me
pulling
on
her
gloves
and
said
so
you
think
i
ought
to
do
it
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
question
and
replied
ought
to
do
it
have
you
done
it
already
yes
that
is
well
yes
i
done
it
i
engaged
and
i
can
tell
from
your
manner
that
i
done
the
right
thing
well
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
i
crossed
the
room
to
her
who
is
it
oh
god
no
let
drop
it
i
ca
bear
any
more
now
good
night
she
stretched
her
hand
out
fumblingly
but
since
she
was
looking
at
the
floor
she
could
not
find
mine
and
both
our
hands
circled
helplessly
round
each
other
for
a
moment
then
she
opened
the
door
and
was
gone
i
called
to
her
begging
her
to
wait
seized
my
hat
and
hurried
after
her
an
empty
staircase
i
rushed
down
and
opened
the
street
door
an
empty
street
she
must
have
run
i
try
to
see
her
tomorrow
i
thought
one
day
two
days
but
i
did
not
see
her
though
i
went
to
all
the
usual
places
another
day
nothing
then
i
thought
i
would
go
up
to
her
home
and
inquire
about
her
at
first
this
did
not
seem
to
me
too
improper
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
hesitated
there
is
after
all
something
to
be
lost
by
making
a
fool
of
oneself
but
was
i
not
a
kind
of
uncle
no
yes
of
course
but
still
a
week
passes
two
weeks
three
the
girl
has
quite
disappeared
i
hope
she
has
had
an
accident
i
mount
the
stairs
to
her
home
and
ring
the
bell
she
already
gone
away
they
left
as
soon
as
they
were
married
last
week
she
married
to
nikolai
carpenter
nikolai
march
what
a
month
the
winter
is
over
yet
there
no
telling
how
much
longer
it
may
still
last
that
what
march
is
for
i
have
lived
through
another
winter
and
seen
the
nigger
entertainment
at
the
theater
you
were
there
too
my
friend
you
saw
how
cleverly
we
all
turned
somersaults
why
you
even
took
part
yourself
and
you
carry
about
a
broken
rib
as
a
cherished
little
memento
of
the
occasion
i
saw
it
all
from
a
slight
distance
away
ten
miles
to
be
exact
no
people
were
near
me
but
there
were
seven
heavens
above
and
pretty
soon
i
shall
be
reading
what
the
officials
have
to
say
about
the
year
harvest
in
our
country
that
is
to
say
the
harvest
at
the
theater
in
dollars
and
in
sterling
the
waggish
professor
is
enjoying
himself
quite
in
his
element
there
he
goes
and
complacent
sir
mediocrity
in
all
his
glory
by
next
year
he
will
have
dragged
other
progressive
people
in
his
wake
he
will
have
dressed
up
norway
still
more
and
made
it
still
more
attractive
to
the
more
dollars
and
more
sterling
what
do
i
hear
someone
objecting
yes
switzerland
well
then
we
shall
invite
switzerland
to
dinner
and
toast
her
thus
colleague
our
great
aim
is
to
resemble
you
who
else
can
squeeze
so
much
profit
out
of
their
mountains
who
else
can
file
at
such
clockwork
switzerland
make
yourself
at
home
we
do
want
to
rob
you
there
are
no
pickpockets
at
this
table
here
to
you
but
if
that
does
help
we
shall
have
to
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
fight
there
are
still
norwegians
left
in
good
old
norway
and
our
rival
is
switzerland
henriksen
brings
catkins
in
a
vase
into
my
room
what
is
it
spring
oh
it
getting
on
then
i
shall
be
going
away
you
see
henriksen
i
should
very
much
have
liked
to
stay
because
this
is
really
where
i
belong
but
what
more
can
i
do
here
i
do
work
i
merely
idle
do
you
understand
me
i
grieve
continually
and
my
heart
sits
wrinkled
my
most
brilliant
achievement
is
spinning
coins
i
toss
a
coin
into
the
air
and
wait
when
i
came
here
last
autumn
i
was
so
bad
not
nearly
so
bad
i
was
only
half
a
year
younger
then
yet
i
was
ten
years
younger
what
has
happened
to
me
since
nothing
only
i
not
a
better
man
than
i
was
last
autumn
but
you
been
all
right
all
winter
have
you
and
three
weeks
ago
when
you
came
back
from
the
country
you
were
so
happy
was
i
i
do
remember
that
ah
well
things
do
move
so
fast
and
nothing
has
happened
to
me
in
these
three
weeks
well
never
mind
at
all
events
i
shall
go
away
i
must
travel
when
the
spring
comes
i
have
always
done
so
in
the
past
and
i
want
to
do
the
same
thing
now
sit
down
mrs
henriksen
no
thank
you
i
too
busy
too
busy
yes
you
work
you
not
ten
years
older
than
you
were
last
autumn
you
think
it
hard
work
to
rest
on
sundays
do
you
dear
madame
henriksen
you
and
your
little
daughter
knit
stockings
for
the
whole
family
you
let
your
rooms
you
keep
your
family
together
like
a
mother
but
you
must
let
your
little
louise
sit
for
twelve
years
on
a
school
form
if
you
do
you
hardly
ever
see
her
all
through
her
youth
those
formative
years
of
her
life
and
then
she
ca
be
like
you
or
learn
from
you
she
learn
to
have
children
easily
enough
but
she
wo
learn
to
be
a
mother
and
when
the
time
comes
for
her
to
keep
her
home
and
family
together
she
will
not
be
able
to
do
it
she
only
know
languages
and
mathematics
and
the
story
of
bluebeard
but
that
is
not
food
for
the
heart
of
a
woman
that
is
twelve
years
of
continual
famine
for
her
soul
excuse
my
asking
but
where
are
you
going
to
i
do
know
but
i
going
why
where
should
i
go
i
shall
go
aboard
a
steamship
and
sail
and
when
i
have
sailed
long
enough
i
will
go
ashore
if
i
find
on
looking
about
me
that
i
have
traveled
too
far
or
not
far
enough
i
shall
board
a
ship
again
and
sail
on
once
i
walked
across
into
sweden
as
far
as
kalmar
and
even
öland
but
that
was
too
far
so
i
turned
back
no
one
cares
to
know
where
i
am
least
of
all
myself
xxxvi
you
get
used
to
everything
you
even
get
used
to
the
passage
of
two
years
and
now
it
is
spring
again
it
is
market
day
in
the
frontier
town
my
room
is
noisy
for
there
is
music
down
in
the
fields
the
roundabout
is
whirling
the
tightrope
walker
is
gossiping
outside
his
tent
and
people
of
every
sort
throng
the
village
the
crowds
are
great
and
there
is
even
a
sprinkling
of
norwegians
from
across
the
border
horses
snort
and
whinny
cows
low
and
trading
is
brisk
in
the
display
window
of
the
goldsmith
across
the
road
a
great
cow
of
silver
has
made
its
appearance
a
handsome
breeder
that
the
local
farmers
stop
to
admire
she
too
smart
for
my
crags
says
one
of
them
with
a
laugh
what
do
you
think
her
price
says
another
with
a
laugh
why
do
you
want
to
buy
her
no
have
got
fodder
enough
this
year
a
man
trudges
placidly
down
the
road
and
also
stops
in
front
of
this
window
i
see
him
from
behind
and
take
note
of
his
massive
back
he
stands
there
a
long
time
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
no
doubt
for
now
and
then
he
scratches
his
beard
there
he
goes
sure
enough
entering
the
shop
with
a
ponderous
tread
i
wonder
if
he
intends
to
buy
the
silver
cow
it
takes
him
an
age
and
still
he
has
come
out
what
on
earth
is
he
doing
in
there
now
that
i
have
begun
to
watch
him
i
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
so
i
put
on
my
hat
and
cross
to
the
goldsmith
window
myself
mingling
with
the
other
spectators
and
watching
the
door
at
last
the
man
yes
it
nikolai
it
was
his
back
and
hands
but
he
has
got
a
beard
now
too
he
looks
splendid
imagine
carpenter
nikolai
being
here
we
greet
each
other
and
we
talk
as
he
shakes
me
slowly
and
ponderously
by
the
hand
our
conversation
is
halting
but
we
get
on
yes
of
course
he
has
gone
into
the
shop
on
business
in
a
kind
of
way
you
not
bought
the
silver
cow
have
you
oh
no
not
that
it
did
amount
to
anything
really
in
fact
i
buy
anything
by
degrees
i
discover
that
he
is
buying
a
horse
and
he
tells
me
that
he
has
dug
that
piece
of
land
of
his
and
is
turning
it
into
pasture
and
his
wife
oh
yes
thank
you
for
asking
she
lives
in
health
to
this
day
by
the
way
he
said
have
you
come
here
over
the
fjeld
yes
i
came
last
winter
in
december
what
a
pity
i
did
know
i
explained
that
i
had
had
the
time
to
visit
his
home
then
i
was
in
a
hurry
there
was
some
business
yes
i
understand
he
said
we
said
little
more
for
nikolai
was
as
taciturn
as
ever
besides
he
had
other
business
to
attend
to
he
can
not
absent
himself
from
the
farm
for
long
and
had
to
return
next
day
have
you
bought
your
horse
yet
well
no
i
have
do
you
think
you
will
i
do
know
yet
i
trying
to
split
a
difference
of
five
and
twenty
later
i
saw
nikolai
going
to
the
goldsmith
again
he
seemed
to
do
a
great
deal
of
business
there
i
could
have
company
across
the
fjeld
now
i
thought
it
spring
and
do
i
not
always
travel
in
the
spring
i
began
to
pack
my
knapsack
nikolai
emerged
once
more
apparently
as
as
he
had
entered
i
opened
my
window
and
called
to
him
to
ask
if
he
had
bought
the
horse
the
man
wo
meet
my
price
well
ca
you
meet
his
i
could
he
replied
slowly
but
i
do
think
i
got
enough
money
on
me
i
could
lend
you
some
at
this
nikolai
smiled
and
shook
his
head
as
though
my
offer
were
a
fairy
tale
thank
you
just
the
same
he
said
turning
to
walk
away
where
are
you
going
now
i
asked
to
look
at
another
horse
it
old
and
small
still
was
i
thrusting
myself
on
the
man
i
nonsense
i
do
see
that
at
all
he
felt
offended
because
i
had
passed
his
door
last
winter
without
stopping
and
now
i
wanted
to
make
him
friendly
again
that
was
all
but
as
i
wanted
no
cause
for
i
stopped
packing
nor
would
i
ask
nikolai
if
i
might
go
back
with
him
but
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
town
i
had
as
much
right
to
do
that
as
anyone
i
met
nikolai
in
the
street
with
a
colt
and
we
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
is
it
yours
yes
i
bought
her
the
man
met
me
halfway
after
all
he
replied
with
a
smile
we
walked
along
to
the
stable
together
and
fed
and
petted
the
horse
she
was
a
mare
two
and
a
half
years
old
with
a
tawny
coat
and
an
mane
and
tail
a
perfect
little
lady
that
evening
nikolai
came
over
to
my
room
of
his
own
accord
for
a
chat
about
the
mare
and
the
state
of
the
roads
when
he
was
saying
at
the
door
he
seemed
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
by
the
way
he
said
i
suppose
it
no
good
asking
you
but
you
could
get
a
lift
for
your
knapsack
you
know
we
could
be
there
day
after
tomorrow
he
added
how
could
i
offend
him
again
we
walked
all
next
day
spent
the
night
in
the
mountain
hut
at
the
frontier
and
then
went
on
again
nikolai
carried
my
knapsack
all
the
way
as
well
as
his
own
smaller
parcels
when
i
suggested
that
we
should
share
the
burden
he
said
it
was
no
weight
at
all
i
think
nikolai
wanted
to
spare
the
little
tawny
lady
at
noon
we
saw
the
fjord
beneath
us
nikolai
stopped
and
carefully
rubbed
down
the
mare
once
more
as
our
path
sloped
downward
i
felt
a
pressure
a
contraction
in
my
chest
it
was
the
sea
air
nikolai
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
but
it
was
nothing
on
reaching
his
home
we
found
the
yard
well
swept
and
in
the
doorway
a
woman
on
her
knees
with
her
back
toward
us
scrubbing
the
floor
it
was
the
saturday
cleaning
day
hullo
nikolai
roared
in
a
tremendously
loud
voice
stopping
dead
in
his
tracks
as
he
did
so
the
woman
in
the
doorway
looked
round
her
hair
was
gray
but
it
was
she
miss
ingeborg
footnote
translator
note
ingeborg
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
hastily
mopping
up
the
rest
of
the
floor
look
at
all
the
cleaning
that
goes
on
here
nikolai
said
laughing
that
her
idea
of
fun
and
i
had
believed
carpenter
nikolai
incapable
of
lightheartedness
yet
i
had
seen
how
content
he
had
been
all
the
way
home
how
deeply
content
and
proud
of
the
little
lady
he
was
bringing
with
him
even
now
he
was
still
stroking
her
fru
ingeborg
rose
to
her
feet
her
skirts
dark
with
the
damp
it
all
seemed
strange
to
me
her
hair
was
so
gray
i
needed
a
little
time
a
moment
to
collect
myself
and
turned
away
to
give
her
time
too
what
a
lovely
horse
i
heard
her
exclaim
nikolai
went
on
stroking
the
mare
i
brought
a
visitor
with
me
he
said
i
went
to
her
and
perhaps
i
do
know
perhaps
i
rather
overdid
my
unconcern
i
greeted
her
and
insisted
on
shaking
her
wet
hand
which
she
hesitated
to
give
me
i
was
anxious
to
appear
quite
formal
with
her
and
shook
her
hand
as
i
repeated
my
greeting
well
of
all
people
she
replied
i
persisted
in
my
formal
attitude
you
must
blame
your
husband
i
said
it
his
fault
that
i
here
i
wish
you
heartily
welcome
she
returned
how
lucky
i
just
got
through
the
cleaning
a
slight
pause
we
looked
at
each
other
two
years
had
passed
since
our
last
meeting
to
break
the
silence
we
all
began
to
admire
the
mare
nikolai
swelling
with
pride
then
we
heard
a
child
calling
from
within
the
house
and
the
young
mother
ran
off
come
in
wo
you
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
as
soon
as
i
entered
i
saw
that
the
room
had
been
changed
there
was
too
much
frippery
white
curtains
at
the
windows
numerous
pictures
on
the
walls
a
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
underneath
it
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
round
table
and
chairs
knickknacks
in
a
china
cupboard
a
spinning
wheel
flowers
in
pots
in
short
the
room
was
crowded
this
no
doubt
was
the
sort
of
thing
fru
ingeborg
had
been
used
to
and
considered
in
good
taste
but
in
petra
day
this
had
been
a
light
and
spacious
room
how
your
mother
i
asked
nikolai
as
usual
he
was
slow
to
reply
his
wife
answered
for
him
she
very
well
i
wanted
to
ask
where
is
she
but
i
refrained
look
i
want
to
show
you
something
said
fru
ingeborg
it
was
the
child
in
his
bed
a
boy
big
and
handsome
about
a
year
old
he
frowned
at
me
at
first
but
only
for
a
moment
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
mother
arm
he
looked
at
me
without
fear
how
happy
and
beautiful
the
young
mother
looked
peerless
indeed
with
her
eyes
full
of
an
inscrutable
graciousness
she
had
not
possessed
before
what
a
fine
little
i
said
admiring
the
boy
i
should
think
he
was
said
the
mother
you
get
used
to
everything
the
sea
air
no
longer
oppresses
me
i
can
speak
without
losing
my
breath
to
the
woman
who
is
now
the
mistress
of
this
house
she
likes
to
talk
too
pouring
out
her
words
nervously
as
though
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
last
opened
her
mouth
what
we
talked
about
well
we
neither
asked
nor
answered
questions
about
measuring
angles
or
analyzing
shakespeare
grammar
had
she
ever
thought
her
matriculation
would
land
her
up
here
amid
livestock
and
saturday
cleaning
oh
that
parody
of
an
education
she
had
taken
the
first
toddling
steps
in
a
dozen
sciences
but
if
she
met
someone
with
fully
adult
knowledge
she
was
lost
she
had
other
things
to
think
about
now
her
home
and
her
family
and
the
farm
of
course
there
was
much
livestock
now
that
mother
had
taken
half
of
it
with
her
has
petra
gone
away
married
to
the
schoolmaster
no
petra
had
wanted
to
stay
when
the
young
wife
took
possession
one
evening
a
strange
man
had
come
to
the
house
and
petra
had
wanted
to
admit
him
but
fru
ingeborg
would
not
she
knew
who
he
was
and
wanted
him
to
leave
so
there
were
quarrels
between
the
older
woman
and
the
young
one
petra
was
also
dissatisfied
with
the
young
wife
work
in
the
barn
it
was
true
she
was
not
very
skillful
but
she
was
learning
all
the
time
and
enjoyed
improving
her
skill
she
never
asked
questions
that
she
saw
would
have
been
foolish
but
she
worked
things
out
by
herself
and
kept
her
eyes
open
when
she
visited
neighboring
farms
that
did
mean
to
say
she
could
learn
everything
there
were
things
she
never
learned
properly
because
she
was
not
to
the
manner
born
often
the
wives
of
rural
officials
are
from
small
towns
and
have
not
learned
the
ways
of
the
country
though
they
must
learn
them
in
time
but
they
never
learn
them
well
they
know
only
just
enough
for
their
daily
needs
to
set
up
a
weave
you
must
have
grown
up
with
the
sound
of
the
shuttle
in
your
ears
to
tend
the
cattle
as
they
should
be
tended
you
must
have
helped
your
mother
since
childhood
you
can
learn
from
others
but
it
will
not
be
in
your
blood
not
everyone
has
a
man
like
nikolai
to
live
with
either
the
young
wife
is
very
fond
of
her
nikolai
this
sound
hearty
bear
who
loves
her
in
return
besides
nikolai
is
not
exacting
his
wife
seems
to
him
peerless
in
all
she
does
of
course
she
has
taken
great
pains
it
has
left
its
mark
on
her
too
and
she
is
not
gray
for
nothing
a
few
months
ago
she
lost
a
front
tooth
too
broke
it
on
some
bird
shot
left
in
the
breast
of
a
ptarmigan
she
was
eating
she
hardly
dared
look
in
the
mirror
now
recognize
herself
but
what
did
it
matter
as
long
as
nikolai
look
what
he
brought
her
this
brooch
bought
at
the
goldsmith
at
the
market
was
it
lovely
oh
nikolai
was
mad
but
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
him
too
imagine
using
some
of
the
money
for
the
horse
on
a
brooch
where
is
he
now
where
he
gone
to
she
bet
anything
stroking
the
mare
again
nikolai
she
called
yes
his
reply
came
from
the
stable
she
sat
down
again
crossing
her
legs
her
face
had
turned
pink
perhaps
a
thought
a
memory
passed
through
her
mind
she
was
suffused
with
excitement
and
beauty
her
dress
clung
to
her
body
outlining
its
contours
she
began
gently
to
stroke
her
knee
is
the
child
asleep
i
asked
i
had
to
say
something
yes
he
asleep
and
think
of
him
she
exclaimed
can
you
imagine
anything
more
wonderful
excuse
my
talking
like
this
but
you
know
he
not
a
year
old
yet
i
never
knew
children
were
such
a
blessing
well
you
see
they
are
yes
i
thought
differently
once
i
remember
that
perfectly
well
and
you
contradicted
me
of
course
it
was
stupid
of
me
children
miracles
and
when
you
old
they
the
only
happiness
the
last
happiness
i
shall
have
more
i
shall
have
many
of
them
a
whole
row
of
them
like
organ
pipes
each
taller
than
the
last
they
lovely
but
i
wish
i
lost
my
tooth
it
leaves
such
a
black
gap
i
really
feel
quite
bad
about
it
on
nikolai
account
i
suppose
a
false
one
could
be
put
in
but
i
should
dream
of
it
besides
i
understand
it
quite
dear
but
given
up
using
any
arts
i
only
wish
i
stopped
earlier
i
gone
on
much
too
long
think
of
all
i
missed
by
it
all
my
childhood
all
my
youth
have
i
idled
away
whole
summers
at
resorts
even
as
a
grown
woman
i
needed
a
holiday
from
my
school
work
a
rest
and
immediately
turned
it
into
sheer
futility
every
day
a
disgrace
i
could
cry
with
regret
i
should
have
been
married
ten
years
ago
and
had
my
husband
all
that
time
and
a
home
and
many
children
now
i
already
old
cheated
out
of
ten
years
of
my
life
with
gray
hair
and
one
tooth
gone
well
you
lost
one
tooth
but
i
hardly
got
one
left
no
sooner
had
i
consoled
her
thus
than
i
regretted
it
why
should
i
make
myself
worse
than
i
am
things
were
bad
enough
anyhow
i
was
sick
with
fury
at
myself
and
grinned
and
grimaced
to
show
her
my
teeth
here
do
miss
them
have
a
good
look
but
i
afraid
she
saw
what
a
fool
i
was
making
of
myself
everything
i
did
was
wrong
then
she
consoled
me
in
her
turn
as
people
do
when
they
can
well
afford
it
what
you
old
nonsense
have
you
met
the
schoolmaster
i
asked
abruptly
of
course
i
remember
what
you
told
me
about
him
a
horse
and
a
man
came
riding
along
the
road
but
he
got
sense
and
he
terribly
stingy
oh
he
cunning
he
borrows
our
harrow
because
ours
is
new
and
good
they
built
a
house
at
the
end
of
the
valley
and
take
in
travelers
quite
a
big
hotel
in
fact
with
the
waitresses
dressed
in
national
costume
of
course
nikolai
and
i
both
went
to
the
wedding
petra
really
looked
a
charming
and
lovely
bride
you
must
think
she
and
i
are
still
unfriendly
she
likes
me
better
now
that
i
more
competent
and
last
summer
they
sent
for
me
several
times
to
interpret
for
some
english
people
and
that
sort
of
thing
at
least
i
know
how
to
say
soap
and
food
and
conveyance
and
tips
in
other
languages
but
i
do
think
i
should
ever
have
had
any
serious
trouble
with
petra
in
the
first
place
if
sophie
had
come
home
you
know
the
schoolmistress
in
the
town
she
always
found
plenty
to
criticize
in
me
so
i
never
liked
her
very
much
i
must
admit
but
when
she
came
here
she
was
very
arrogant
toward
me
and
lorded
it
over
me
showing
off
all
her
knowledge
i
was
busy
trying
to
learn
what
i
needed
to
know
for
the
life
up
here
and
then
she
came
along
and
made
me
look
small
talking
about
the
seven
years
war
all
the
time
she
was
terribly
learned
about
the
seven
years
war
because
that
what
she
had
in
her
examination
and
our
way
of
talking
was
elegant
enough
for
her
nikolai
used
rough
country
expressions
sometimes
and
she
did
like
that
but
nikolai
speaks
quite
well
enough
and
i
ca
see
what
that
fool
of
a
sister
of
his
has
got
to
put
on
airs
for
and
on
top
of
that
she
came
home
to
stay
for
six
months
anyhow
she
been
engaged
so
then
she
had
to
take
a
six
months
holiday
the
baby
with
petra
with
his
grandmother
so
he
well
taken
care
of
it
a
boy
too
but
he
hardly
got
any
hair
mine
has
plenty
of
hair
well
in
a
way
of
course
it
a
pity
about
sophie
because
she
used
up
her
legacy
and
her
youth
studying
to
be
a
schoolmistress
and
then
she
comes
home
like
that
but
she
really
was
insufferable
thinking
she
was
a
lot
better
than
i
because
she
had
been
discharged
like
me
so
i
asked
her
to
leave
and
then
they
both
left
sophie
and
her
mother
anyhow
her
mother
and
i
are
quite
reconciled
but
you
must
think
we
had
any
help
from
her
to
buy
the
horse
nothing
of
the
kind
we
borrowed
the
money
from
the
bank
but
manage
because
it
our
only
debt
nikolai
has
made
all
the
furniture
in
here
himself
the
table
and
china
cupboard
and
everything
we
bought
a
thing
he
dug
up
the
new
field
himself
too
and
we
be
getting
more
cattle
you
ought
to
see
what
a
handsome
heifer
we
got
even
the
food
was
good
enough
for
sophie
tins
saved
such
a
lot
of
trouble
she
said
we
ought
to
buy
tinned
food
it
was
enough
to
make
you
sick
to
listen
to
her
i
was
just
beginning
to
knit
too
i
got
one
of
my
neighbors
to
teach
me
and
i
was
knitting
stockings
for
myself
but
of
course
lady
sophie
well
she
bought
her
stockings
in
the
city
oh
she
was
charming
out
i
said
to
her
so
they
left
nikolai
entered
the
room
did
you
want
me
no
oh
yes
i
wanted
you
to
come
upstairs
with
me
i
need
something
to
hang
things
on
in
front
of
the
fire
a
clotheshorse
come
along
i
stayed
behind
thinking
if
only
it
lasts
if
only
it
lasts
she
so
overwrought
living
on
her
nerves
and
pregnant
again
but
what
splendid
resolution
she
shows
and
how
she
matured
in
these
two
years
but
it
has
cost
her
a
great
deal
too
good
luck
to
you
ingeborg
good
luck
at
all
events
she
had
triumphed
over
schoolmistress
sophie
who
had
once
tried
so
hard
to
set
nikolai
against
her
get
out
how
content
fru
ingeborg
must
be
what
delight
in
this
small
triumph
life
had
changed
so
much
that
such
things
were
important
to
her
she
grew
heated
again
when
she
mentioned
it
and
pulled
at
her
fingers
as
she
had
done
in
her
schooldays
and
why
should
she
not
be
content
a
small
triumph
now
had
the
rank
of
a
bigger
one
in
the
old
days
proportions
were
changed
but
her
satisfaction
was
no
less
listen
she
has
begun
to
read
upstairs
there
the
sound
of
a
steady
hum
yes
it
sunday
today
and
she
being
the
best
educated
of
them
naturally
reads
the
service
bravo
magnificent
she
has
extended
her
even
to
this
for
they
are
all
orthodox
christians
in
this
neighborhood
believing
no
but
not
hostile
either
one
reads
scripture
rather
a
clever
ruse
that
of
the
clotheshorse
she
has
become
an
excellent
cook
too
in
the
peasant
style
delicious
broth
without
noodles
but
otherwise
just
as
it
should
be
with
barley
carrots
and
thyme
i
doubt
whether
she
has
learned
this
at
the
domestic
science
school
i
consider
all
the
things
she
has
learned
and
find
them
numerous
had
she
perhaps
been
a
little
overstrung
in
her
talk
about
children
like
organ
pipes
i
do
know
but
her
nostrils
dilated
like
a
mare
as
she
spoke
she
must
have
known
how
unwillingly
couples
have
children
and
how
short
is
the
love
between
them
in
the
daytime
they
are
together
so
that
people
might
not
talk
but
the
night
separates
them
she
was
different
for
she
would
make
hers
a
house
of
fruitfulness
often
she
and
her
husband
were
apart
during
the
day
when
their
separate
labors
called
them
but
the
night
united
them
bravo
fru
ingeborg
xxxvii
really
it
was
time
i
was
leaving
at
least
i
could
have
moved
across
to
petra
and
the
schoolmaster
who
take
in
travelers
really
i
ought
to
do
that
nikolai
has
got
his
tawny
lady
working
on
the
farm
she
harnessed
to
a
neat
cart
that
he
has
made
himself
and
banded
with
iron
and
now
the
lady
carts
manure
the
tiny
farm
with
its
few
head
of
cattle
does
yield
too
much
of
this
precious
substance
so
it
is
soon
spread
then
the
lady
draws
the
plow
and
looks
as
though
it
were
no
more
than
the
heavy
train
of
a
ball
dress
behind
her
nikolai
has
never
heard
of
such
a
horse
before
and
neither
has
his
wife
i
take
a
walk
down
to
the
newly
dug
field
and
look
at
it
from
every
angle
then
i
take
soil
in
my
hand
and
feel
it
and
nod
exactly
as
though
i
knew
something
about
it
rich
black
soil
sheer
perfection
i
walk
so
far
that
i
can
see
the
gargoyles
on
petra
hotel
and
suddenly
turn
off
the
path
into
the
woods
to
sheltered
groves
and
catkins
and
peace
the
air
is
still
spring
will
soon
be
here
and
so
the
days
wear
on
i
am
comfortable
and
feel
very
much
at
home
how
i
should
like
to
stay
here
i
should
pay
well
for
my
keep
and
make
myself
useful
and
popular
i
should
harm
a
fly
but
that
evening
i
tell
nikolai
that
i
must
think
of
moving
on
this
will
not
do
and
perhaps
he
will
mention
it
ca
you
stop
a
while
longer
he
says
but
i
suppose
it
is
the
kind
of
place
god
bless
you
nikolai
it
the
kind
of
place
but
well
spring
now
and
i
always
travel
in
the
spring
i
should
have
to
be
very
low
before
i
gave
that
up
and
besides
i
expect
you
both
pretty
tired
of
me
at
least
your
wife
this
too
i
hoped
he
would
mention
then
i
packed
my
knapsack
and
waited
no
no
one
came
to
take
the
knapsack
out
of
my
hand
and
forbid
me
to
pack
any
farther
so
perhaps
nikolai
has
mentioned
it
the
man
never
does
open
his
mouth
so
i
placed
the
knapsack
on
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
all
packed
and
ready
for
everyone
to
see
that
we
leaving
and
i
waited
for
the
morning
of
the
next
day
and
this
time
the
knapsack
observed
no
it
was
so
i
had
to
wait
till
the
housewife
called
us
to
the
midday
meal
and
tell
her
then
pointing
to
what
was
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
be
leaving
today
no
really
why
do
you
want
to
go
away
she
said
why
well
do
you
think
i
should
well
of
course
but
you
might
have
stayed
on
a
bit
longer
the
cows
will
be
going
out
to
spring
pasture
now
and
we
should
have
had
more
milk
that
was
all
we
said
about
it
and
then
she
went
back
to
her
work
bravo
fru
ingeborg
you
it
struck
me
then
as
it
had
done
already
on
several
occasions
that
she
had
grown
very
like
josephine
at
tore
peak
both
in
her
way
of
thinking
and
her
mode
of
expression
twelve
years
of
school
had
laid
no
foundations
in
her
young
mind
though
it
had
loosened
much
that
was
firm
within
her
but
that
did
not
matter
as
long
as
she
kept
a
firm
hold
now
nikolai
is
going
down
to
the
trading
center
and
since
he
will
be
bringing
back
some
sacks
of
flour
he
intends
to
drive
i
know
very
well
that
i
ought
to
go
with
him
because
then
i
could
catch
the
mail
packet
next
day
but
one
i
explain
this
to
nikolai
and
pay
my
bill
while
he
is
harnessing
the
horse
i
finish
packing
my
bag
oh
these
eternal
journeys
hardly
am
i
settled
in
one
place
than
i
am
again
unsettled
in
another
no
home
no
roots
what
are
those
bells
i
hear
ah
yes
fru
ingeborg
lets
the
cows
out
they
are
going
to
pasture
for
the
first
time
this
spring
so
that
they
shall
give
more
milk
here
comes
nikolai
to
tell
me
he
is
ready
yes
here
is
the
knapsack
nikolai
is
it
a
bit
early
to
let
the
cows
out
yes
but
they
getting
restless
in
the
cow
houses
yesterday
i
was
in
the
woods
and
wanted
to
sit
down
but
i
can
not
sit
in
the
snow
no
i
can
not
though
i
could
ten
years
ago
i
must
wait
till
there
is
really
something
to
sit
on
a
rock
is
good
enough
but
you
sit
on
a
rock
for
very
long
in
may
nikolai
looks
uneasily
at
the
mare
through
the
window
yes
let
go
and
there
were
no
butterflies
either
you
know
those
butterflies
that
have
wings
exactly
like
pansies
there
were
any
and
if
happiness
lives
in
the
forest
i
mean
if
god
himself
well
he
moved
out
yet
it
too
early
nikolai
does
not
reply
to
my
nonsense
after
all
it
is
only
the
incoherent
expression
of
a
vague
feeling
a
gentle
melancholy
we
go
outside
together
nikolai
i
not
going
he
turns
around
and
looks
at
me
his
eyes
smiling
you
see
nikolai
i
think
i
have
got
an
idea
i
feel
exactly
as
though
an
idea
had
come
to
me
that
may
turn
into
a
great
iron
so
i
disturb
myself
i
staying
well
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
says
nikolai
as
long
as
you
like
being
here
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
can
see
nikolai
and
the
mare
trotting
briskly
down
the
road
fru
ingeborg
stands
in
the
yard
with
the
boy
on
her
arm
to
watch
the
gamboling
calves
and
here
stand
i
a
fine
old
specimen
i
am
nikolai
returned
with
my
mail
quite
a
little
pile
had
accumulated
in
the
past
few
weeks
i
thought
you
not
in
the
habit
of
reading
your
letters
said
fru
ingeborg
banteringly
nikolai
sat
listening
to
us
no
i
returned
just
say
the
word
and
i
burn
them
unread
suddenly
she
turned
pale
she
had
put
her
hand
with
a
smile
on
the
letters
brushing
my
hand
as
she
did
so
i
felt
a
great
ardor
a
miraculous
blood
heat
more
than
blood
heat
only
for
a
moment
then
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
said
better
read
them
she
was
deeply
flushed
now
i
saw
him
burn
his
letters
once
she
explained
to
nikolai
then
she
found
something
to
do
at
the
stove
while
she
asked
her
husband
about
his
journey
about
the
road
whether
the
mare
had
behaved
well
which
she
had
a
minor
occurrence
of
no
importance
to
anyone
perhaps
i
should
not
have
mentioned
it
a
few
days
later
the
weather
has
grown
warm
my
window
is
open
my
door
to
the
living
room
is
open
all
is
still
i
stand
at
the
window
looking
out
a
man
entered
the
courtyard
carrying
an
unshapely
burden
i
could
not
see
his
face
very
well
but
thought
it
was
nikolai
carrying
something
so
i
went
back
to
my
table
to
work
again
a
little
later
i
heard
someone
say
good
morning
in
the
living
room
fru
ingeborg
did
not
return
the
greeting
instead
i
heard
her
ask
in
loud
hostile
tones
what
do
you
want
i
come
to
pay
you
a
visit
my
husband
is
in
he
in
the
field
never
mind
i
do
mind
she
cried
go
away
i
do
know
what
her
face
looked
like
then
but
her
voice
was
gray
gray
with
tears
and
indignation
in
a
moment
i
was
in
the
living
room
the
stranger
was
solem
another
meeting
with
solem
he
was
everywhere
our
eyes
met
i
think
you
were
asked
to
leave
i
said
take
it
easy
take
it
easy
he
said
in
a
kind
of
i
trade
in
hides
i
go
round
to
the
farms
buying
up
hides
have
you
got
any
no
she
cried
out
her
voice
broke
she
was
completely
distracted
and
suddenly
dipped
a
ladle
into
a
pot
that
was
boiling
on
the
stove
perhaps
she
was
on
the
point
of
flinging
it
at
him
at
this
juncture
nikolai
entered
the
house
he
was
a
man
but
his
eyes
suddenly
quickened
as
he
took
in
the
situation
did
he
know
solem
and
had
he
seen
him
coming
to
the
farm
he
laughed
a
little
ha
ha
ha
he
said
and
went
on
smiling
left
his
smile
standing
it
looked
horrible
he
was
quite
white
and
his
mouth
seemed
to
have
stiffened
in
a
smiling
cramp
here
was
an
equal
for
solem
a
sexual
colleague
a
stallion
in
strength
and
stubbornness
and
still
he
went
on
smiling
well
if
you
have
any
hides
said
solem
finding
the
door
nikolai
followed
him
still
smiling
in
the
yard
he
helped
solem
raise
his
burden
to
his
back
oh
thank
you
said
solem
in
an
uncomfortable
tone
the
bale
of
furs
and
skins
was
a
large
one
nikolai
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
solem
back
swung
it
to
his
back
in
a
curious
fashion
with
needless
emphasis
knees
gave
way
under
him
and
he
fell
on
his
face
we
heard
a
groan
of
pain
for
the
paved
yard
was
hard
as
the
face
of
the
mountain
solem
lay
still
for
a
moment
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
his
face
had
struck
the
ground
in
falling
and
the
blood
was
running
down
into
his
eyes
he
tried
to
hoist
his
burden
higher
up
his
back
but
it
remained
hanging
slack
he
began
to
walk
away
with
nikolai
behind
him
still
smiling
thus
they
walked
down
the
road
one
behind
the
other
and
disappeared
into
the
woods
well
let
us
be
human
that
fall
to
the
ground
was
bad
the
heavy
burden
hanging
down
so
uncomfortably
from
one
shoulder
looked
bad
indoors
i
heard
a
sound
of
sobbing
fru
ingeborg
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
in
a
chair
and
in
her
condition
too
well
give
it
time
it
will
pass
off
gradually
we
begin
to
talk
and
by
asking
her
questions
i
force
her
to
collect
herself
he
that
man
that
beast
oh
you
do
know
how
dreadful
he
is
i
could
murder
him
he
was
the
one
he
was
the
first
but
now
he
getting
it
all
back
he
getting
more
than
his
own
back
you
see
he
was
the
first
i
was
all
right
till
then
but
he
was
the
first
not
that
it
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
i
do
want
to
seem
any
better
than
i
am
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
but
afterward
i
began
to
understand
and
it
drew
so
much
evil
in
its
train
i
fell
so
low
i
was
on
my
knees
it
was
his
fault
and
afterward
it
all
grew
clear
to
me
i
want
that
man
to
leave
me
alone
i
do
ever
want
to
see
him
again
that
not
unreasonable
is
it
oh
where
nikolai
you
do
think
he
do
anything
to
him
do
you
put
him
in
prison
please
run
after
them
stop
him
he
kill
him
no
no
he
has
too
much
sense
besides
he
does
know
does
he
that
solem
has
done
anything
to
you
she
looked
up
at
me
then
are
you
asking
on
your
own
account
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
i
want
to
know
if
you
asking
on
your
own
account
sometimes
you
seem
as
though
you
were
trying
to
find
me
out
i
told
my
husband
you
can
think
what
you
please
about
my
honesty
i
only
told
him
part
of
it
just
a
little
that
the
man
would
leave
me
alone
been
here
once
before
he
was
the
man
petra
wanted
to
admit
that
i
would
have
in
i
said
to
nikolai
wo
have
that
man
coming
in
here
and
i
told
him
a
little
more
but
i
did
tell
him
about
myself
so
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
honesty
but
i
do
want
to
tell
him
now
either
i
do
ever
want
to
tell
him
why
well
i
do
owe
you
any
explanation
but
i
do
mind
your
knowing
yes
i
want
to
tell
you
please
you
see
it
not
because
i
afraid
of
nikolai
anger
but
of
his
forgiveness
i
could
bear
to
go
on
living
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
sure
he
try
to
find
excuses
for
me
because
that
his
nature
he
fond
of
me
and
he
a
peasant
too
and
peasants
do
take
these
things
so
seriously
but
if
he
did
find
excuses
for
me
he
be
much
good
and
i
do
want
him
to
be
no
good
i
swear
i
do
rather
be
no
good
myself
oh
we
both
have
faults
to
forgive
in
each
other
but
we
need
all
of
what
left
we
do
want
to
be
animals
we
want
to
be
human
beings
and
i
thinking
of
the
future
and
our
children
but
you
ought
to
make
me
talk
so
much
why
did
you
ask
me
that
all
i
meant
was
that
if
nikolai
does
know
then
it
could
occur
to
him
to
kill
the
man
and
that
was
what
you
were
worried
about
i
just
wanted
to
reassure
you
yes
you
always
so
clever
you
turn
me
inside
out
i
wish
now
i
told
you
i
wish
you
did
know
i
should
have
kept
it
to
myself
till
i
died
now
you
just
think
i
thoroughly
dishonest
on
the
contrary
really
do
you
think
that
quite
the
contrary
what
you
told
me
is
absolutely
right
entirely
true
and
right
and
not
only
that
it
fine
god
bless
you
she
said
and
began
to
sob
again
there
now
you
must
cry
here
comes
nikolai
walking
up
the
road
as
good
and
placid
as
ever
is
he
oh
thank
god
you
know
i
have
really
any
fault
to
find
with
him
i
was
too
hasty
when
i
said
that
even
if
i
tried
to
find
something
i
could
of
course
he
uses
expressions
sometimes
i
mean
he
says
some
words
differently
but
it
was
only
his
sister
that
put
that
into
my
head
i
must
go
out
and
meet
him
now
she
began
to
look
around
for
something
to
slip
over
her
shoulders
but
it
took
her
a
few
minutes
because
she
was
still
quite
shaken
before
she
had
found
anything
nikolai
trudged
into
the
yard
oh
there
you
are
you
have
done
anything
rash
have
you
nikolai
features
were
still
a
little
drawn
as
he
replied
no
i
just
took
him
over
to
see
his
son
has
solem
got
a
son
here
i
asked
neither
of
them
replied
nikolai
turned
to
go
back
to
his
work
and
his
wife
went
with
him
across
the
field
suddenly
i
understood
sophie
child
how
well
i
remember
that
day
at
tore
peak
when
schoolmistress
sophie
palm
came
in
to
tell
us
the
latest
news
about
solem
about
the
bandage
on
his
finger
the
finger
he
never
had
time
to
get
rid
of
stout
fellow
they
made
each
other
acquaintance
then
and
probably
met
again
later
in
the
town
solem
was
everywhere
the
ladies
at
the
tore
peak
resort
well
solem
was
no
angel
but
they
did
little
to
improve
him
and
so
he
met
this
woman
who
had
learned
nothing
but
to
teach
i
ought
to
have
understood
before
this
i
do
understand
anything
any
more
but
something
has
happened
to
me
now
at
last
i
beginning
to
suspect
that
their
chief
reason
for
wanting
to
keep
me
here
is
simply
that
they
need
money
my
board
and
rent
are
to
pay
for
the
mare
that
all
it
amounts
to
i
should
have
known
it
long
ago
but
i
am
old
perhaps
i
may
add
without
being
misunderstood
that
the
brain
withers
before
the
heart
you
can
see
it
in
all
grandparents
at
first
i
said
bravo
to
my
discovery
bravo
fru
ingeborg
i
said
you
are
priceless
once
again
but
human
nature
is
such
that
i
began
to
feel
hurt
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
pay
for
the
mare
once
and
for
all
and
depart
i
should
have
been
more
than
pleased
to
do
so
but
i
should
not
have
succeeded
nikolai
would
have
shaken
his
head
as
though
it
were
a
fairy
tale
then
i
began
to
calculate
that
in
fact
there
be
much
to
pay
for
the
mare
now
perhaps
nothing
perhaps
she
was
paid
for
fru
ingeborg
labors
and
slaves
i
afraid
she
works
too
hard
she
seldom
sits
down
though
her
pregnancy
is
far
advanced
now
and
she
needs
rest
she
makes
beds
cooks
sees
to
the
animals
sews
mends
and
washes
often
a
lock
of
gray
hair
falls
down
on
either
side
of
her
face
and
she
is
so
busy
that
she
lets
it
hang
it
too
short
to
be
fastened
back
with
a
pin
but
she
looks
charming
and
motherly
with
her
fine
skin
and
her
mouth
she
and
the
child
together
are
sheer
beauty
of
course
i
help
to
carry
wood
and
water
but
i
make
more
work
for
her
just
the
same
when
i
think
of
that
i
grow
hot
about
the
ears
but
how
could
i
have
imagined
that
anyone
would
want
to
keep
me
for
my
own
sake
i
should
not
have
had
all
these
years
too
many
then
and
these
ardors
too
few
a
good
thing
i
found
it
out
at
last
in
a
way
the
discovery
made
it
easier
for
me
to
leave
them
and
this
time
when
i
packed
my
knapsack
i
meant
it
but
at
least
the
child
her
boy
had
some
love
for
me
and
liked
to
sit
on
my
arm
because
i
showed
him
so
much
that
was
strange
it
was
the
child
instinct
for
the
peerless
grandfather
at
about
this
time
a
sister
of
fru
ingeborg
came
to
the
farm
to
help
with
the
housework
i
began
to
pack
then
overcome
with
grief
i
packed
to
spare
nikolai
and
the
mare
i
decided
to
make
my
way
down
to
the
steamship
landing
on
foot
i
shall
also
arrange
to
relieve
all
of
us
of
the
need
for
farewells
and
handshakes
and
believe
me
but
in
spite
of
my
resolution
i
could
not
after
all
avoid
taking
them
both
by
the
hand
and
thanking
them
for
their
hospitality
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
i
stood
in
the
doorway
with
my
knapsack
already
on
my
back
smiling
a
little
and
behaving
splendidly
yes
indeed
i
said
i
must
begin
to
move
about
again
are
you
really
going
said
fru
ingeborg
why
not
but
so
suddenly
did
i
tell
you
yesterday
yes
of
course
but
would
you
like
nikolai
to
drive
you
no
thank
you
the
boy
was
interested
now
for
i
had
a
knapsack
on
my
back
and
a
coat
with
entirely
unfamiliar
buttons
he
wanted
me
to
carry
him
very
well
then
just
for
a
moment
but
it
was
for
more
than
a
moment
more
than
a
few
moments
too
the
knapsack
had
to
be
opened
and
investigated
of
course
then
nikolai
entered
the
room
fru
ingeborg
said
to
me
i
afraid
you
think
that
just
because
my
sister
here
now
but
got
another
room
and
besides
now
that
it
summer
she
could
easily
sleep
in
the
loft
but
my
dear
child
i
must
leave
time
i
have
work
to
do
too
you
know
well
of
course
said
fru
ingeborg
giving
it
up
nikolai
offered
to
drive
me
but
did
not
press
me
when
i
thanked
him
and
refused
they
came
to
the
gate
with
me
and
watched
me
walk
away
the
boy
sitting
on
his
mother
arm
at
the
bend
of
the
road
i
turned
round
to
wave
to
the
child
of
course
not
to
anyone
else
only
to
the
child
but
there
was
no
longer
anyone
there
xxxviii
i
have
written
this
story
for
you
why
have
i
written
thus
because
my
soul
cries
out
with
boredom
before
every
christmas
boredom
with
all
the
books
that
are
all
written
the
same
way
i
had
even
the
intention
of
writing
in
dialect
so
as
to
be
truly
norwegian
but
when
i
saw
you
understood
the
country
language
also
i
gave
up
writing
in
dialect
because
for
one
thing
it
is
becoming
obsolete
but
why
have
i
gathered
so
many
incongruities
within
a
single
framework
my
friend
one
of
the
most
celebrated
literary
creations
was
written
during
a
plague
of
a
plague
this
is
my
answer
and
my
friend
when
you
have
lived
for
a
long
time
away
from
the
human
beings
you
know
inside
and
out
then
you
indulge
once
more
in
the
iniquity
of
speech
your
powers
have
been
so
little
used
that
your
head
is
filled
with
a
thousand
sermons
this
is
my
defense
if
i
know
you
at
all
you
will
revel
in
one
or
other
of
my
outspoken
passages
especially
where
there
is
a
nocturnal
episode
you
will
lick
your
chops
but
to
others
you
will
shake
your
head
and
say
think
of
his
writing
such
things
alas
small
vulgar
soul
retire
into
solitude
and
try
to
understand
that
episode
it
has
cost
me
much
to
surrender
it
to
you
perhaps
too
you
will
be
interested
in
myself
and
ask
about
my
irons
well
i
may
give
you
their
greeting
they
are
the
irons
of
one
who
is
half
a
century
old
he
has
no
other
kind
but
the
distinction
between
myself
and
my
brother
travelers
is
that
i
freely
admit
i
have
none
but
these
they
were
planned
so
big
and
so
red
yet
they
are
small
irons
and
they
hardly
glow
this
is
the
truth
they
congregate
with
the
painstaking
works
of
others
round
the
christmas
table
this
is
the
truth
it
is
the
truth
even
though
in
spite
of
everything
they
are
distinct
from
the
nothingness
of
others
you
can
not
judge
this
for
you
are
the
modern
spirit
in
norway
and
this
is
the
spirit
i
scorn
one
thing
you
will
admit
you
have
not
wasted
your
time
in
cultured
company
i
have
not
tried
to
quench
your
little
upstart
heart
with
a
lady
i
have
written
about
human
beings
but
within
the
speech
that
is
spoken
another
lies
concealed
like
the
veins
under
the
skin
like
a
story
within
a
story
i
have
followed
the
septuagenarian
of
literature
step
by
step
and
reported
the
progress
of
his
disintegration
i
should
have
written
this
description
long
ago
but
i
had
not
years
enough
only
now
am
i
entering
upon
them
directly
and
indirectly
i
should
have
done
it
while
the
country
was
groping
for
long
periods
under
the
shadow
of
superannuated
incompetence
instead
i
do
it
now
when
i
myself
am
being
accused
of
a
tendency
to
cast
shadows
sensationalism
you
will
say
chasing
after
fame
my
dear
chaste
friend
i
have
fame
enough
for
the
last
twenty
years
of
my
life
and
after
that
i
shall
be
dead
and
you
may
you
live
long
you
deserve
it
may
you
almost
survive
me
in
the
flesh
i
have
just
read
what
a
man
on
the
pinnacle
of
culture
has
said
experience
shows
that
when
culture
spreads
it
grows
thin
and
colorless
then
one
must
not
raise
an
outcry
against
the
bearers
of
a
new
renaissance
i
can
no
longer
herald
a
renaissance
it
is
too
late
now
once
when
i
had
the
power
to
do
much
and
the
desire
to
do
more
mediocrity
everywhere
was
too
strong
i
was
the
giant
with
the
feet
of
clay
the
lot
of
many
youths
but
now
my
small
small
friend
look
about
you
there
has
appeared
within
even
your
field
of
vision
a
figure
here
and
a
figure
there
a
shining
crest
lavish
with
its
bounty
geniuses
beneath
the
open
sky
you
and
i
should
bid
them
welcome
i
walk
in
the
evening
of
life
and
trembling
recognize
myself
in
them
they
are
youth
with
jeweled
eyes
yet
you
begrudge
them
your
recognition
yes
you
begrudge
them
fame
because
you
are
nobody
to
you
to
the
modern
spirit
of
norway
i
have
written
this
during
a
plague
and
because
of
the
plague
i
can
not
stop
the
rot
no
it
is
unassailable
now
it
flourishes
under
national
protection
but
one
day
no
doubt
it
will
stop
meanwhile
i
do
what
i
can
to
fight
it
you
do
the
reverse
of
course
i
have
shouted
in
the
marketplace
perhaps
that
is
why
my
voice
is
hoarse
now
cracked
at
times
there
are
worse
things
a
worse
thing
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
obeyed
me
is
there
any
danger
of
that
no
my
friend
not
for
you
you
will
live
till
you
die
be
assured
why
have
i
written
to
you
of
all
people
why
do
you
think
you
refused
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
and
integrity
of
my
conclusions
but
i
shall
yet
force
you
to
recognize
that
i
am
close
to
the
truth
not
until
then
shall
i
make
allowance
for
the
fool
in
you
