preface
jonas
lie
is
sufficiently
famous
to
need
but
a
very
few
words
of
introduction
ever
since
when
he
made
his
reputation
by
his
first
novel
he
has
been
a
prime
favourite
with
the
scandinavian
public
and
of
late
years
his
principal
romances
have
gone
the
round
of
europe
he
has
written
novels
of
all
kinds
but
he
excels
when
he
describes
the
wild
seas
of
northern
norway
and
the
stern
and
hardy
race
of
sailors
and
fishers
who
seek
their
fortunes
and
so
often
find
their
graves
on
those
dangerous
waters
such
tales
for
instance
as
tremasteren
fremtid
lodsen
og
hans
hustru
gaa
paa
and
are
unique
of
their
kind
and
give
far
truer
pictures
of
norwegian
life
and
character
in
the
rough
than
anything
that
can
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
literature
indeed
lie
skippers
and
mates
are
as
superior
to
kjelland
for
instance
as
the
peasants
of
jens
tvedt
a
writer
by
the
way
still
unknown
beyond
his
native
land
are
superior
to
the
peasants
of
björnstjerne
björnson
but
it
is
when
lie
tells
us
some
of
the
wild
legends
of
his
native
province
nordland
some
of
the
grim
tales
on
which
he
himself
was
brought
up
so
to
speak
that
he
is
perhaps
most
vivid
and
enthralling
the
of
those
lonely
tracts
is
in
keeping
with
the
savagery
of
nature
we
rarely
if
ever
hear
of
friendly
elves
or
companionable
gnomes
there
the
supernatural
beings
that
haunt
those
shores
and
seas
are
for
the
most
part
malignant
and
malefic
they
seem
to
hate
man
they
love
to
mock
his
toils
and
sport
with
his
despair
in
his
very
first
romance
lie
relates
two
of
these
weird
tales
nos
and
of
the
present
selection
another
tale
in
which
many
of
the
superstitious
beliefs
and
wild
imaginings
of
the
nordland
fishermen
are
skilfully
grouped
together
to
form
the
background
of

on

down
in

dwelt
a
poor
fisherman
elias
by
name
with
his
wife
karen
who
had
been
in
service
at
the
parson
over
at
alstad
they
had
built
them
a
hut
here
and
he
used
to
go
out
fishing
by
the
day
about
the
lofotens
there
could
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
lonely
kvalholm
was
haunted
whenever
her
husband
was
away
karen
heard
all
manner
of
uncanny
shrieks
and
noises
which
could
mean
no
good
one
day
when
she
was
up
on
the
hillside
mowing
grass
to
serve
as
winter
fodder
for
their
couple
of
sheep
she
heard
quite
plainly
a
chattering
on
the
strand
beneath
the
hill
but
look
over
she
durst
not
they
had
a
child
every
year
but
that
was
no
burden
for
they
were
both
thrifty
folks
when
seven
years
had
gone
by
there
were
six
children
in
the
house
but
that
same
autumn
elias
had
scraped
together
so
much
that
he
thought
he
might
now
venture
to
buy
a
and
henceforward
go
fishing
in
his
own
boat
one
day
as
he
was
walking
along
with
a
in
his
hand
and
thinking
the
matter
over
he
unexpectedly
came
upon
a
monstrous
seal
which
lay
sunning
itself
right
behind
a
rock
on
the
strand
and
was
as
much
surprised
to
see
the
man
as
the
man
was
to
see
the
seal
but
elias
was
not
slack
from
the
top
of
the
rock
on
which
he
stood
he
hurled
the
long
heavy
kvejtepig
right
into
the
monster
back
just
below
the
neck
the
seal
immediately
rose
up
on
its
tail
right
into
the
air
as
high
as
a
boat
mast
and
looked
so
evilly
and
viciously
at
him
with
its
bloodshot
eyes
at
the
same
time
showing
its
grinning
teeth
that
elias
thought
he
should
have
died
on
the
spot
for
sheer
fright
then
it
plunged
into
the
sea
and
lashed
the
water
into
bloody
foam
behind
it
elias
did
stop
to
see
more
but
that
same
evening
there
drifted
into
the
boat
place
on
kvalcreek
on
which
his
house
stood
a
kvejtepole
with
the
hooked
iron
head
snapped
off
elias
thought
no
more
about
it
but
in
the
course
of
the
autumn
he
bought
his
for
which
he
had
been
building
a
little
the
whole
summer
one
night
as
he
lay
awake
thinking
of
his
new
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
boat
would
balance
better
perhaps
if
he
stuck
an
extra
log
of
wood
on
each
side
of
it
he
was
so
absurdly
fond
of
the
boat
that
it
was
a
mere
pastime
for
him
to
light
a
lantern
and
go
down
to
have
a
look
at
it
now
as
he
stood
looking
at
it
there
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
suddenly
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
corner
opposite
on
a
coil
of
nets
of
a
face
which
exactly
resembled
the
seal
for
an
instant
it
grinned
savagely
at
him
and
the
light
its
mouth
all
the
time
growing
larger
and
larger
and
then
a
big
man
whisked
out
of
the
door
not
so
quickly
however
but
that
elias
could
catch
a
glimpse
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
of
a
long
iron
hooked
spike
sticking
out
of
his
back
and
now
he
began
to
put
one
and
two
together
still
he
was
less
anxious
about
his
life
than
about
his
boat
so
he
there
and
then
sat
him
down
in
it
with
the
lantern
and
kept
watch
when
his
wife
came
in
the
morning
she
found
him
sleeping
there
with
the
lantern
by
his
side
one
morning
in
january
while
he
was
out
fishing
in
his
boat
with
two
other
men
he
heard
in
the
dark
a
voice
from
a
skerry
at
the
very
entrance
of
the
creek
it
laughed
scornfully
and
said
when
it
to
a
elias
look
to
thyself
but
there
was
many
a
long
year
yet
before
it
come
to
that
but
one
autumn
when
his
son
bernt
was
sixteen
elias
knew
he
could
manage
it
so
he
took
his
whole
family
with
him
in
his
boat
to
ranen
to
exchange
his
for
a
the
only
person
left
at
home
was
a
little
finn
girl
whom
they
had
taken
into
service
some
few
years
before
and
who
had
only
lately
been
confirmed
now
there
was
a
boat
a
little
for
four
men
and
a
boy
that
elias
just
then
had
his
eye
upon
a
boat
which
the
best
in
the
place
had
finished
and
tarred
over
that
very
autumn
elias
had
a
very
good
notion
of
what
a
boat
should
be
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
a
so
well
built
the
the
indeed
it
looked
only
middling
so
that
to
one
of
less
experience
than
himself
the
boat
would
have
seemed
rather
a
heavy
goer
than
otherwise
and
anything
but
a
smart
craft
now
the
knew
all
this
just
as
well
as
elias
he
said
he
thought
it
would
be
the
swiftest
sailer
in
ranen
but
that
elias
should
have
it
cheap
all
the
same
if
only
he
would
promise
one
thing
and
that
was
to
make
no
alteration
whatever
in
the
boat
nay
not
so
much
as
adding
a
fresh
coat
of
tar
only
when
elias
had
expressly
given
his
word
upon
it
did
he
get
the
boat
but
yon
laddie
who
had
taught
the
how
to
build
his
boats
so
cunningly
the
the
he
had
had
to
use
his
native
wits
and
they
were
scant
enough
must
surely
have
been
there
beforehand
and
bidden
him
both
sell
it
cheaply
so
that
elias
might
get
it
and
stipulate
besides
that
the
boat
should
not
be
looked
at
too
closely
in
this
way
it
escaped
the
usual
tarring
fore
and
aft
elias
now
thought
about
sailing
home
but
went
first
into
the
town
provided
himself
and
family
with
provisions
against
christmas
and
indulged
in
a
little
nip
of
brandy
besides
glad
as
he
was
over
the
day
bargain
he
and
his
wife
too
took
an
extra
drop
in
their
and
their
son
bernt
had
a
taste
of
it
too
after
that
they
sailed
off
homewards
in
their
new
boat
there
was
no
other
ballast
in
the
boat
but
himself
his
old
woman
the
children
and
the
christmas
provisions
his
son
bernt
sat
by
the
his
wife
helped
by
her
next
eldest
son
held
the
elias
himself
sat
at
the
rudder
while
the
two
younger
brothers
of
twelve
and
fourteen
were
to
take
it
in
turns
to
bail
out
they
had
eight
miles
of
sea
to
sail
over
and
when
they
got
into
the
open
it
was
plain
that
the
boat
would
be
tested
pretty
stiffly
on
its
first
voyage
a
gale
was
gradually
blowing
up
and
crests
of
foam
began
to
break
upon
the
heavy
sea
and
now
elias
saw
what
sort
of
a
boat
he
really
had
she
skipped
over
the
waves
like
a
not
so
much
as
a
splash
came
into
the
boat
and
he
therefore
calculated
that
he
would
have
no
need
to
take
in
all
his
clews
against
the
wind
which
an
ordinary
would
have
been
forced
to
do
in
such
weather
out
on
the
sea
not
very
far
away
from
him
he
saw
another
with
a
full
crew
and
four
clews
in
the
sail
just
like
his
own
it
lay
on
the
same
course
and
he
thought
it
rather
odd
that
he
had
not
noticed
it
before
it
made
as
if
it
would
race
him
and
when
elias
perceived
that
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
help
letting
out
a
clew
again
and
now
he
went
racing
along
like
a
dart
past
capes
and
islands
and
rocks
till
it
seemed
to
elias
as
if
he
had
never
had
such
a
splendid
sail
before
now
too
the
boat
showed
itself
what
it
really
was
the
best
boat
in
ranen
the
weather
meantime
had
become
worse
and
they
had
already
got
a
couple
of
dangerous
seas
right
upon
them
they
broke
in
over
the
in
the
forepart
of
the
boat
where
bernt
sat
and
sailed
out
again
to
leeward
near
the
stern
since
the
gloom
had
deepened
the
other
boat
had
kept
almost
alongside
and
they
were
now
so
close
together
that
they
could
easily
have
pitched
the
from
one
to
the
other
so
they
raced
on
side
by
side
in
constantly
stiffer
seas
till
and
beyond
it
the
fourth
clew
ought
now
to
have
been
taken
in
again
but
elias
did
want
to
give
in
and
thought
he
might
bide
a
bit
till
they
took
it
in
in
the
other
boat
also
which
they
needs
do
soon
ever
and
anon
the
was
brought
out
and
passed
round
for
they
had
now
both
cold
and
wet
to
hold
out
against
the
which
played
on
the
dark
billows
near
elias
own
boat
shone
with
an
odd
vividness
in
the
foam
round
the
other
boat
just
as
if
a
was
ploughing
up
and
turning
over
the
water
in
the
bright
phosphorescence
he
could
plainly
make
out
the
on
board
her
he
could
also
see
distinctly
the
folks
on
board
with
their
on
their
heads
but
as
their
larboard
side
lay
nearest
of
course
they
all
had
their
backs
towards
him
and
were
hidden
by
the
high
heeling
hull
suddenly
a
tremendous
roller
burst
upon
them
elias
had
long
caught
a
glimpse
of
its
white
crest
through
the
darkness
right
over
the
prow
where
bernt
sat
it
filled
the
whole
boat
for
a
moment
the
planks
shook
and
trembled
beneath
the
weight
of
it
and
then
as
the
boat
which
had
lain
half
on
her
righted
herself
and
sped
on
again
it
streamed
off
behind
to
leeward
while
it
was
still
upon
him
he
fancied
he
heard
a
hideous
yell
from
the
other
boat
but
when
it
was
over
his
wife
who
sat
by
the
shrouds
said
with
a
voice
which
pierced
his
very
soul
good
god
elias
the
sea
has
carried
off
martha
and
nils
their
two
youngest
children
the
first
nine
the
second
seven
years
old
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
hold
near
bernt
elias
merely
answered
do
let
go
the
lines
karen
or
you
lose
yet
more
they
had
now
to
take
in
the
fourth
clew
and
when
this
was
done
elias
found
that
it
would
be
well
to
take
in
the
fifth
and
last
clew
too
for
the
gale
was
ever
on
the
increase
but
on
the
other
hand
in
order
to
keep
the
boat
free
of
the
constantly
heavier
seas
he
dare
not
lessen
the
sail
a
bit
more
than
he
was
absolutely
obliged
to
do
but
they
found
that
the
scrap
of
sail
they
could
carry
gradually
grew
less
and
less
the
sea
seethed
so
that
it
drove
right
into
their
faces
and
bernt
and
his
next
eldest
brother
anthony
who
had
hitherto
helped
his
mother
with
the
had
at
last
to
hold
in
the
yards
an
expedient
one
only
resorts
to
when
the
boat
can
not
bear
even
the
last
clew
here
the
fifth
the
companion
boat
which
had
disappeared
in
the
meantime
now
suddenly
ducked
up
alongside
again
with
precisely
the
same
amount
of
sail
as
elias
boat
but
he
now
began
to
feel
that
he
did
quite
like
the
look
of
the
crew
on
board
there
the
two
who
stood
and
held
in
the
yards
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
their
pale
faces
beneath
their
seemed
to
him
by
the
odd
light
of
the
shining
foam
more
like
corpses
than
men
nor
did
they
speak
a
single
word
a
little
way
off
to
larboard
he
again
caught
sight
of
the
high
white
back
of
a
fresh
roller
coming
through
the
dark
and
he
got
ready
betimes
to
receive
it
the
boat
was
laid
to
with
its
prow
turned
aslant
towards
the
wave
while
the
sail
was
made
as
large
as
possible
so
as
to
get
up
speed
enough
to
cleave
the
heavy
sea
and
sail
out
of
it
again
in
rushed
the
roller
with
a
roar
like
a
foss
again
for
an
instant
they
lay
on
their
beam
ends
but
when
it
was
over
the
wife
no
longer
sat
by
the
sail
ropes
nor
did
anthony
stand
there
any
longer
holding
the
yards
they
had
both
gone
overboard
this
time
also
elias
fancied
he
heard
the
same
hideous
yell
in
the
air
but
in
the
midst
of
it
he
plainly
heard
his
wife
anxiously
calling
him
by
name
all
that
he
said
when
he
grasped
the
fact
that
she
was
washed
overboard
was
in
jesus
name
his
first
and
dearest
wish
was
to
follow
after
her
but
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
it
became
him
to
save
the
rest
of
the
freight
he
had
on
board
that
is
to
say
bernt
and
his
other
two
sons
one
twelve
the
other
fourteen
years
old
who
had
been
baling
out
for
a
time
but
had
afterwards
taken
their
places
in
the
stern
behind
him
bernt
had
now
to
look
to
the
yards
all
alone
and
the
other
two
helped
as
best
they
could
the
rudder
elias
durst
not
let
slip
and
he
held
it
fast
with
a
hand
of
iron
which
continuous
exertion
had
long
since
made
insensible
to
feeling
a
moment
afterwards
the
comrade
boat
ducked
up
again
it
had
vanished
for
an
instant
as
before
now
too
he
saw
more
of
the
heavy
man
who
sat
in
the
stern
there
in
the
same
place
as
himself
out
of
his
back
just
below
his
as
he
turned
round
it
showed
quite
plainly
projected
an
iron
spike
six
inches
long
which
elias
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
again
and
now
as
he
calmly
thought
it
all
over
he
was
quite
clear
about
two
things
one
was
that
it
was
the
itself
which
was
steering
its
close
beside
him
and
leading
him
to
destruction
the
other
was
that
it
was
written
in
heaven
that
he
was
to
sail
his
last
course
that
night
for
he
who
sees
the
draug
on
the
sea
is
a
doomed
man
he
said
nothing
to
the
others
lest
they
should
lose
heart
but
in
secret
he
commended
his
soul
to
god
during
the
last
hour
or
so
he
had
been
forced
out
of
his
proper
course
by
the
storm
the
air
also
had
become
dense
with
snow
and
elias
knew
that
he
must
wait
till
dawn
before
land
could
be
sighted
meanwhile
he
sailed
along
much
the
same
as
before
now
and
then
the
boys
in
the
stern
complained
that
they
were
freezing
but
in
the
plight
they
were
now
in
that
could
be
helped
and
besides
elias
had
something
else
to
think
about
a
terrible
longing
for
vengeance
had
come
over
him
and
but
for
the
necessity
of
saving
the
lives
of
his
three
lads
he
would
have
tried
by
a
sudden
turn
to
sink
the
accursed
boat
which
kept
alongside
of
him
the
whole
time
as
if
to
mock
him
he
now
understood
its
evil
errand
only
too
well
if
the
could
reach
the
draug
before
a
knife
or
a
gaff
might
surely
do
the
same
thing
now
and
he
felt
that
he
would
gladly
have
given
his
life
for
one
good
grip
of
the
being
who
had
so
mercilessly
torn
from
him
his
dearest
in
this
world
and
would
fain
have
still
more
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
they
saw
coming
upon
them
through
the
darkness
a
breaker
of
such
a
height
that
at
first
elias
thought
they
must
be
quite
close
ashore
near
the
surf
swell
nevertheless
he
soon
recognised
it
for
what
it
really
was
a
huge
billow
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
there
was
a
laugh
over
in
the
other
boat
and
something
said
there
goes
thy
boat
elias
he
foreseeing
the
calamity
now
cried
aloud
in
jesus
name
and
then
bade
his
sons
hold
on
with
all
their
might
to
the
by
the
rowlocks
when
the
boat
went
under
and
not
let
go
till
it
was
above
the
water
again
he
made
the
elder
of
them
go
forward
to
bernt
and
himself
held
the
youngest
close
by
his
side
stroked
him
once
or
twice
furtively
down
the
cheeks
and
made
sure
that
he
had
a
good
grip
the
boat
literally
buried
beneath
the
foaming
roller
was
lifted
gradually
up
by
the
bows
and
then
went
under
when
it
rose
again
out
of
the
water
with
the
keel
in
the
air
elias
bernt
and
the
martin
lay
alongside
holding
on
by
the
but
the
third
of
the
brothers
was
gone
they
had
now
first
of
all
to
get
the
shrouds
on
one
side
cut
through
so
that
the
mast
might
come
to
the
surface
alongside
instead
of
disturbing
the
balance
of
the
boat
below
and
then
they
must
climb
up
on
the
swaying
bottom
of
the
boat
and
stave
in
the
to
let
out
the
air
which
kept
the
boat
too
high
in
the
water
and
so
ease
her
after
great
exertions
they
succeeded
and
elias
who
had
got
up
on
the
top
first
now
helped
the
other
two
up
after
him
there
they
sat
through
the
long
dark
winter
night
clinging
convulsively
on
by
their
hands
and
knees
to
the
boat
bottom
which
was
drenched
by
the
billows
again
and
again
after
the
lapse
of
a
couple
of
hours
died
martin
whom
his
father
had
held
up
the
whole
time
as
far
as
he
was
able
of
sheer
exhaustion
and
glided
down
into
the
sea
they
had
tried
to
cry
for
help
several
times
but
gave
it
up
at
last
as
a
bad
job
whilst
they
two
thus
sat
all
alone
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
elias
said
to
bernt
he
must
now
needs
believe
that
he
too
was
about
to
be
along
mother
but
that
he
had
a
strong
hope
that
bernt
at
any
rate
would
be
saved
if
he
only
held
out
like
a
man
then
he
told
him
all
about
the
whom
he
had
struck
below
the
neck
with
the
and
how
it
had
now
revenged
itself
upon
him
and
certainly
would
not
forbear
till
it
was
quits
with
him
it
was
towards
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
grey
dawn
began
to
appear
then
elias
gave
to
bernt
who
sat
alongside
him
his
silver
watch
with
the
brass
chain
which
he
had
snapped
in
two
in
order
to
drag
it
from
beneath
his
closely
buttoned
jacket
he
held
on
for
a
little
time
longer
but
as
it
got
lighter
bernt
saw
that
his
father
face
was
deadly
pale
his
hair
too
had
parted
here
and
there
as
often
happens
when
death
is
at
hand
and
his
skin
was
chafed
off
his
hands
from
holding
on
to
the
keel
the
son
understood
now
that
his
father
was
nearly
at
the
last
gasp
and
tried
so
far
as
the
pitching
and
tossing
would
allow
it
to
hold
him
up
but
when
elias
marked
it
he
said
nay
look
to
thyself
bernt
and
hold
on
fast
i
go
to
mother
in
name
and
with
that
he
cast
himself
down
headlong
from
the
top
of
the
boat
every
one
who
has
sat
on
the
keel
of
a
boat
long
enough
knows
that
when
the
sea
has
got
its
own
it
grows
much
calmer
though
not
immediately
bernt
now
found
it
easier
to
hold
on
and
still
more
of
hope
came
to
him
with
the
brightening
day
the
storm
abated
and
when
it
got
quite
light
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
knew
where
he
was
and
that
it
was
outside
his
own
homestead
kvalholm
that
he
lay
driving
he
now
began
again
to
cry
for
help
but
his
chief
hope
was
in
a
current
which
he
knew
bore
landwards
at
a
place
where
a
headland
broke
in
upon
the
surge
and
there
the
water
was
calmer
and
he
did
in
fact
drive
closer
and
closer
in
and
came
at
last
so
near
to
one
of
the
rocks
that
the
mast
which
was
floating
by
the
side
of
the
boat
all
the
time
surged
up
and
down
in
the
swell
against
the
sloping
cliff
stiff
as
he
now
was
in
all
his
limbs
from
sitting
and
holding
on
he
nevertheless
succeeded
after
a
great
effort
in
clambering
up
the
cliff
where
he
hauled
the
mast
ashore
and
made
the
fast
the
finn
girl
who
was
alone
in
the
house
had
been
thinking
for
the
last
two
hours
that
she
had
heard
cries
for
help
from
time
to
time
and
as
they
kept
on
she
mounted
the
hill
to
see
what
it
was
there
she
saw
bernt
up
on
the
cliff
and
the
overturned
bobbing
up
and
down
against
it
she
immediately
dashed
down
to
the
got
out
the
old
and
rowed
along
the
shore
and
round
the
island
right
out
to
him
bernt
lay
sick
under
her
care
the
whole
winter
through
and
did
go
a
fishing
all
that
year
ever
after
this
too
it
seemed
to
folks
as
if
the
lad
were
a
little
bit
daft
on
the
open
sea
he
never
would
go
again
for
he
had
got
the
he
wedded
the
finn
girl
and
moved
over
to
malang
where
he
got
him
a
clearing
in
the
forest
and
he
lives
there
now
and
is
doing
well
they
say
a
district
in
northern
norway
a
boat
with
three
oars
on
each
side
a
long
pole
with
a
hooked
iron
spike
at
the
end
of

for
spearing

a
large

with

the
danish
of

and
the
illustration
jack
of
sjöholm
and
the
gan
in
the
days
of
our
forefathers
when
there
was
nothing
but
wretched
boats
up
in
nordland
and
folks
must
needs
buy
fair
winds
by
the
sackful
from
the
it
was
not
safe
to
tack
about
in
the
open
sea
in
wintry
weather
in
those
days
a
fisherman
never
grew
old
it
was
mostly
womenfolk
and
children
and
the
lame
and
halt
who
were
buried
ashore
now
there
was
once
a
boat
crew
from
thjöttö
in
helgeland
which
had
put
to
sea
and
worked
its
way
right
up
to
the
east
lofotens
but
that
winter
the
fish
would
not
bite
they
lay
to
and
waited
week
after
week
till
the
month
was
out
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
home
again
with
their
fishing
gear
and
empty
boats
but
jack
of
sjöholm
who
was
with
them
only
laughed
aloud
and
said
that
if
there
were
no
fish
there
fish
would
certainly
be
found
higher
northwards
surely
they
had
rowed
out
all
this
distance
only
to
eat
up
all
their
victuals
said
he
he
was
quite
a
young
chap
who
had
never
been
out
fishing
before
but
there
was
some
sense
in
what
he
said
for
all
that
thought
the
and
so
they
set
their
sails
northwards
on
the
next
they
fared
no
better
than
before
but
they
toiled
away
so
long
as
their
food
held
out
and
now
they
all
insisted
on
giving
it
up
and
turning
back
if
there
none
here
there
sure
to
be
some
still
higher
up
towards
the
north
opined
jack
and
if
they
had
gone
so
far
they
might
surely
go
a
little
further
still
quoth
he
so
they
tempted
fortune
from
to
till
they
had
ventured
right
up
to
finmark
but
there
a
storm
met
them
and
try
as
they
might
to
find
shelter
under
the
headlands
they
were
obliged
at
last
to
put
out
into
the
open
sea
again
there
they
fared
worse
than
ever
they
had
a
hard
time
of
it
again
and
again
the
prow
of
the
boat
went
under
the
heavy
rollers
instead
of
over
them
and
later
on
in
the
day
the
boat
foundered
there
they
all
sat
helplessly
on
the
keel
in
the
midst
of
the
raging
sea
and
they
all
complained
bitterly
against
that
fellow
jack
who
had
tempted
them
on
and
led
them
into
destruction
what
would
now
become
of
their
wives
and
children
they
would
starve
now
that
they
had
none
to
care
for
them
when
it
grew
dark
their
hands
began
to
stiffen
and
they
were
carried
off
by
the
sea
one
by
one
and
jack
heard
and
saw
everything
down
to
the
last
shriek
and
the
last
clutch
and
to
the
very
end
they
never
ceased
reproaching
him
for
bringing
them
into
such
misery
and
bewailing
their
sad
lot
i
must
hold
on
tight
now
said
jack
to
himself
for
he
was
better
even
where
he
was
than
in
the
sea
and
so
he
tightened
his
knees
on
the
keel
and
held
on
fast
till
he
had
no
feeling
left
in
either
hand
or
foot
in
the
gusty
night
he
fancied
he
heard
yells
from
one
or
other
of
the
remaining
boats
crews
they
too
have
wives
and
children
thought
he
i
wonder
whether
they
have
also
a
jack
to
lay
the
blame
upon
now
while
he
thus
lay
there
and
drifted
and
drifted
and
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
drawing
towards
dawn
he
suddenly
felt
that
the
boat
was
in
the
grip
of
a
strong
shoreward
current
and
sure
enough
jack
got
at
last
ashore
but
whichever
way
he
looked
he
saw
nothing
but
black
sea
and
white
snow
now
as
he
stood
there
speering
and
spying
about
him
he
saw
far
away
the
smoke
of
a
finn
gamme
which
stood
beneath
a
cliff
and
he
managed
to
scramble
right
up
to
it
the
finn
was
so
old
that
he
could
scarcely
move
he
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
warm
ashes
and
mumbling
into
a
big
sack
and
neither
spoke
nor
answered
large
yellow
were
humming
about
all
over
the
snow
as
if
it
were
midsummer
and
there
was
only
a
young
lass
there
to
keep
the
fire
alight
and
give
the
old
man
his
food
his
grandsons
and
were
with
the
reindeer
far
far
away
on
the
here
jack
got
his
clothes
well
dried
and
the
rest
he
so
much
wanted
the
finn
girl
seimke
could
make
too
much
of
him
she
fed
him
with
reindeer
milk
and
and
he
lay
down
to
sleep
on
silver
cosy
and
comfortable
it
was
in
the
smoke
there
but
as
he
thus
lay
there
sleep
and
wake
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
many
odd
things
were
going
on
round
about
him
there
stood
the
finn
in
the
doorway
talking
to
his
reindeer
although
they
were
far
away
in
the
mountains
he
barred
the
wolf
way
and
threatened
the
bear
with
spells
and
then
he
opened
his
skin
sack
so
that
the
storm
howled
and
piped
and
there
was
a
swirl
of
ashes
into
the
hut
and
when
all
grew
quiet
again
the
air
was
thick
with
yellow
which
settled
inside
his
furs
whilst
he
gabbled
and
mumbled
and
wagged
his
head
but
jack
had
something
else
to
think
about
besides
marvelling
at
the
old
finn
no
sooner
did
the
heaviness
of
slumber
quit
his
eyes
than
he
strolled
down
to
his
boat
there
it
lay
stuck
fast
on
the
beach
and
tilted
right
over
like
a
trough
while
the
sea
rubbed
and
rippled
against
its
keel
he
drew
it
far
enough
ashore
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
but
the
longer
he
walked
around
and
examined
it
the
more
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
folks
built
boats
rather
for
the
sake
of
letting
the
sea
in
than
for
the
sake
of
keeping
the
sea
out
the
prow
was
little
better
than
a
hog
snout
for
burrowing
under
the
water
and
the
planking
by
the
was
as
flat
as
the
bottom
of
a
chest
everything
he
thought
must
be
arranged
very
differently
if
boats
were
to
be
really
seaworthy
the
prow
must
be
raised
one
or
two
planks
higher
at
the
very
least
and
made
both
sharp
and
supple
so
as
to
bend
before
and
cut
through
the
waves
at
the
same
time
and
then
a
fellow
would
have
a
chance
of
steering
a
boat
smartly
he
thought
of
this
day
and
night
the
only
relaxation
he
had
was
a
chat
with
the
finn
girl
of
an
evening
he
could
help
remarking
that
this
seimke
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
she
strolled
after
him
wherever
he
went
and
her
eyes
always
became
so
mournful
when
he
went
down
towards
the
sea
she
understood
well
enough
that
all
his
thoughts
were
bent
upon
going
away
and
the
finn
sat
and
mumbled
among
the
ashes
till
his
fur
jacket
regularly
steamed
and
smoked
but
seimke
coaxed
and
wheedled
jack
with
her
brown
eyes
and
gave
him
honeyed
words
as
fast
as
her
tongue
could
wag
till
she
drew
him
right
into
the
smoke
where
the
old
finn
could
hear
them
the
turned
his
head
right
round
my
eyes
are
stupid
and
the
smoke
makes
run
said
he
what
has
jack
got
hold
of
there
say
it
is
the
white
ptarmigan
you
caught
in
the
snare
whispered
she
and
jack
felt
that
she
was
huddling
up
against
him
and
trembling
all
over
then
she
told
him
so
softly
that
he
thought
it
was
his
own
thoughts
speaking
to
him
that
the
finn
was
angry
and
muttering
mischief
and
against
the
boat
which
jack
wanted
to
build
if
jack
were
to
complete
it
said
she
the
would
no
longer
have
any
sale
for
his
in
all
nordland
and
then
she
warned
him
to
look
to
himself
and
never
get
between
the
finn
and
the
then
jack
felt
that
his
boat
might
be
the
undoing
of
him
but
the
worse
things
looked
the
more
he
tried
to
make
the
best
of
them
in
the
grey
dawn
before
the
finn
was
up
he
made
his
way
towards
the
but
there
was
something
very
odd
about
the
they
were
so
many
and
so
long
that
there
was
really
no
end
to
them
and
he
kept
on
trampling
in
deep
and
deeper
snow
and
never
got
to
the
at
all
never
before
had
he
seen
the
northern
lights
last
so
long
into
the
day
they
blazed
and
sparkled
and
long
tongues
of
fire
licked
and
hissed
after
him
he
was
unable
to
find
either
the
beach
or
the
boat
nor
had
he
the
least
idea
in
the
world
where
he
really
was
at
last
he
discovered
that
he
had
gone
quite
astray
inland
instead
of
down
to
the
sea
but
now
when
he
turned
round
the
came
close
up
against
him
so
dense
and
grey
that
he
could
see
neither
hand
nor
foot
before
him
by
the
evening
he
was
worn
out
with
weariness
and
was
at
his
wits
end
what
to
do
night
fell
and
the
snowdrifts
increased
as
now
he
sat
him
down
on
a
stone
and
fell
a
brooding
and
pondering
how
he
should
escape
with
his
life
a
pair
of
came
gliding
so
smoothly
towards
him
out
of
the
and
stood
still
just
in
front
of
his
feet
as
you
have
found
me
you
may
as
well
find
the
way
back
also
said
he
so
he
put
them
on
and
let
the
go
their
own
way
over
hillside
and
steep
cliff
he
let
not
his
own
eyes
guide
him
or
his
own
feet
carry
him
and
the
swifter
he
went
the
denser
the
snowflakes
and
the
driving
came
up
against
him
and
the
blast
very
nearly
blew
him
off
the
up
hill
and
down
dale
he
went
over
all
the
places
where
he
had
fared
during
the
daytime
and
it
sometimes
seemed
as
if
he
had
nothing
solid
beneath
him
at
all
but
was
flying
in
the
air
suddenly
the
stood
stock
still
and
he
was
standing
just
outside
the
entrance
of
the
hut
there
stood
seimke
she
was
looking
for
him
i
sent
my
after
thee
said
she
for
i
marked
that
the
finn
had
bewitched
the
land
so
that
thou
not
find
the
boat
thy
is
safe
for
he
has
given
thee
shelter
in
his
house
but
it
were
not
well
for
thee
to
see
him
this
evening
then
she
smuggled
him
in
so
that
the
finn
did
not
perceive
it
in
the
thick
smoke
and
she
gave
him
meat
and
a
place
to
rest
upon
but
when
he
awoke
in
the
night
he
heard
an
odd
sound
and
there
was
a
buzzing
and
a
singing
far
away
in
the
air
the
finn
the
boat
can
never
bind
the
fly
the
boatman
can
not
find
but
round
in
aimless
whirls
doth
wind
the
finn
was
sitting
among
the
ashes
and
and
muttering
till
the
ground
quite
shook
while
seimke
lay
with
her
forehead
to
the
floor
and
her
hands
clasped
tightly
round
the
back
of
her
neck
praying
against
him
to
the
finn
god
then
jack
understood
that
the
was
still
seeking
after
him
amidst
the
snowflakes
and
and
that
his
life
was
in
danger
from
magic
spells
so
he
dressed
himself
before
it
was
light
went
out
and
came
tramping
in
again
all
covered
with
snow
and
said
he
had
been
after
bears
in
their
winter
retreats
but
never
had
he
been
in
such
a
before
he
had
groped
about
far
and
wide
before
he
found
his
way
back
into
the
hut
again
though
he
stood
just
outside
it
the
finn
sat
there
with
his
as
full
of
yellow
flies
as
a
beehive
he
had
sent
them
out
searching
in
every
direction
but
back
they
had
all
come
and
were
humming
and
buzzing
about
him
when
he
saw
jack
in
the
doorway
and
perceived
that
the
flies
had
pointed
truly
he
grew
somewhat
milder
and
laughed
till
he
regularly
shook
within
his
and
mumbled
the
bear
we
bind
fast
beneath
the
and
his
eyes
i
turned
all
awry
so
that
he
ca
see
his
boat
and
i
stick
a
in
front
of
him
till
springtime
but
the
same
day
the
finn
stood
in
the
doorway
and
was
busy
making
magic
signs
and
strange
strokes
in
the
air
then
he
sent
forth
two
hideous
which
flitted
off
on
their
errands
and
scorched
black
patches
beneath
them
in
the
snow
wherever
they
went
they
were
to
bring
pain
and
sickness
to
a
cottage
down
in
the
swamps
and
spread
abroad
the
finn
disease
which
was
to
strike
down
a
young
bride
at
bodö
with
consumption
but
jack
thought
of
nothing
else
night
and
day
but
how
he
could
get
the
better
of
the
the
lass
seimke
wheedled
him
and
wept
and
begged
him
as
he
valued
his
life
not
to
try
to
get
down
to
his
boat
again
at
last
however
she
saw
it
was
no
use
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
off
then
she
kissed
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
at
least
he
must
promise
to
wait
till
the
had
gone
right
away
to
jokmok
in
sweden
on
the
day
of
his
departure
the
finn
went
all
round
his
hut
with
a
torch
and
took
stock
far
away
as
they
were
there
stood
the
mountain
pastures
with
the
reindeer
and
the
dogs
and
the
finn
people
all
drew
near
the
finn
took
the
tale
of
the
beasts
and
bade
his
grandsons
not
let
the
reindeer
stray
too
far
while
he
was
away
and
could
not
guard
them
from
wolves
and
bears
then
he
took
a
sleeping
potion
and
began
to
dance
and
turn
round
and
round
till
his
breath
quite
failed
him
and
he
sank
moaning
to
the
ground
his
furs
were
all
that
remained
behind
of
him
his
spirit
had
gone
gone
all
the
way
over
to
jokmok
there
the
magicians
were
all
sitting
together
in
the
dark
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
high
mountain
and
whispering
about
all
manner
of
secret
and
hidden
things
and
blowing
spirits
into
the
novices
of
the
black
art
but
the
humming
and
buzzing
went
round
and
round
the
empty
furs
of
the
like
a
yellow
ring
and
kept
watch
in
the
night
jack
was
awakened
by
something
pulling
and
tugging
at
him
as
if
from
far
away
there
was
as
it
were
a
current
of
air
and
something
threatened
and
called
to
him
from
the
midst
of
the
snowflakes
outside
until
thou
canst
swim
like
the
duck
or
the
drake
the
egg
be
hatching
no
progress
shall
make
the
finn
shall
let
thee
go
southwards
with
sail
for
he
screw
off
the
wind
and
imprison
the
gale
at
the
end
of
it
the
was
standing
there
and
bending
right
over
him
the
skin
of
his
face
hung
down
long
and
loose
and
full
of
wrinkles
like
an
old
reindeer
skin
and
there
was
a
dizzying
smoke
in
his
eyes
then
jack
began
to
shiver
and
stiffen
in
all
his
limbs
and
he
knew
that
the
finn
was
bent
upon
bewitching
him
then
he
set
his
face
rigidly
against
it
so
that
the
magic
spells
should
not
get
at
him
and
thus
they
struggled
with
one
another
till
the
grew
green
in
the
face
and
was
very
near
choking
after
that
the
sorcerers
of
jokmok
sent
magic
shots
after
jack
and
clouded
his
wits
he
felt
so
odd
and
whenever
he
was
busy
with
his
boat
and
had
put
something
to
rights
in
it
something
else
would
immediately
go
wrong
till
at
last
he
felt
as
if
his
head
were
full
of
pins
and
needles
then
deep
sorrow
fell
upon
him
try
as
he
would
he
could
put
his
boat
together
as
he
would
have
it
and
it
looked
very
much
as
if
he
would
never
be
able
to
cross
the
sea
again
but
in
the
summer
time
jack
and
seimke
sat
together
on
the
headland
in
the
warm
evenings
and
the
gnats
buzzed
and
the
fishes
spouted
close
ashore
in
the
stillness
and
the
swam
about
if
only
some
one
would
build
me
a
boat
as
swift
and
nimble
as
a
fish
and
able
to
ride
upon
the
billows
like
a
sighed
and
lamented
jack
then
i
could
be
off
would
you
like
me
to
guide
you
to
thjöttö
said
a
voice
up
from
the
there
stood
a
fellow
in
a
flat
skin
cap
whose
face
they
could
see
and
right
outside
the
boulders
there
just
where
they
had
seen
the
lay
a
long
and
narrow
boat
with
high
prow
and
stern
and
the
were
mirrored
plainly
in
the
clear
water
below
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
single
knot
in
the
wood
i
would
be
thankful
for
any
such
guidance
said
jack
when
seimke
heard
this
she
began
to
cry
and
take
on
terribly
she
fell
upon
his
neck
and
would
let
go
and
raved
and
shrieked
she
promised
him
her
which
would
carry
him
through
everything
and
said
she
would
steal
for
him
the
from
the
so
that
he
might
find
all
the
old
lucky
dollars
that
ever
were
buried
and
would
teach
him
how
to
make
knots
in
the
fishing
lines
and
how
to
entice
the
reindeer
from
afar
he
should
become
as
rich
as
the
if
only
he
would
forsake
her
but
jack
had
only
eyes
for
the
boat
down
there
then
she
sprang
up
and
tore
down
her
black
locks
and
bound
them
round
his
feet
so
that
he
had
to
wrench
them
off
before
he
could
get
quit
of
her
if
i
stay
here
and
play
with
you
and
the
young
reindeer
many
a
poor
fellow
will
have
to
cling
with
broken
nails
to
the
keel
of
a
boat
said
he
if
you
like
to
make
it
up
give
me
a
kiss
and
a
parting
hug
or
shall
i
go
without
them
then
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
like
a
young
wild
cat
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
through
her
tears
and
shivered
and
laughed
and
was
quite
beside
herself
but
when
she
saw
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
she
rushed
away
and
waved
her
hands
above
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
gamme
then
jack
understood
that
she
was
going
to
take
counsel
of
the
and
that
he
had
better
take
refuge
in
his
boat
before
the
way
was
closed
to
him
and
in
fact
the
boat
had
come
so
close
up
to
the
boulders
that
he
had
only
to
step
down
upon
the
thwarts
the
rudder
glided
into
his
hand
and
aslant
behind
the
mast
sat
some
one
at
the
prow
and
hoisted
and
stretched
the
sail
but
his
face
jack
could
not
see
away
they
went
and
such
a
boat
for
running
before
the
wind
jack
had
never
seen
before
the
sea
stood
up
round
about
them
like
a
deep
although
it
was
almost
calm
but
they
had
gone
very
far
before
a
nasty
piping
began
in
the
air
the
birds
shrieked
and
made
for
land
and
the
sea
rose
like
a
black
wall
behind
them
it
was
the
who
had
opened
his
and
sent
a
storm
after
them
one
needs
a
full
sail
in
the
here
said
something
from
behind
the
mast
the
fellow
who
had
the
boat
in
hand
took
such
little
heed
of
the
weather
that
he
did
not
so
much
as
take
in
a
single
clew
then
the
sent
double
knots
after
them
they
sped
along
in
a
wild
dance
right
over
the
firth
and
the
sea
whirled
up
in
white
columns
of
foam
reaching
to
the
very
clouds
unless
the
boat
could
fly
as
quick
and
quicker
than
a
bird
it
was
lost
then
a
hideous
laugh
was
heard
to
larboard
anfinn
ganfinn
gives
mouth
and
blows
us
right
south
there
a
crack
in
the
sack
with
three
clews
we
must
tack
and
heeling
right
over
with
three
clews
in
the
sail
and
the
heavy
foremost
fellow
astride
on
the
with
his
huge
dangling
in
the
away
they
scudded
through
the
blinding
spray
right
into
the
open
sea
amidst
the
howling
and
roaring
of
the
wind
the
billowy
walls
were
so
vast
and
heavy
that
jack
could
even
see
the
light
of
day
across
the
yards
nor
could
he
exactly
make
out
whether
they
were
going
under
or
over
the
the
boat
shook
the
sea
aside
as
lightly
and
easily
as
if
its
prow
were
the
slippery
fin
of
a
fish
and
its
planking
was
as
smooth
and
fine
as
the
shell
of
a
tern
egg
but
look
as
he
would
jack
could
see
where
these
planks
ended
it
was
just
as
if
there
was
only
half
a
boat
and
no
more
and
at
last
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
whole
of
the
front
part
came
off
in
the
and
they
were
scudding
along
under
sail
in
half
a
boat
when
night
fell
they
went
through
the
which
glowed
like
hot
embers
and
there
was
a
prolonged
and
hideous
howling
up
in
the
air
to
windward
and
cries
of
distress
and
howls
of
mortal
agony
answered
the
wind
from
all
the
upturned
boat
keels
they
sped
by
and
many
hideously
folks
clutched
hold
of
their
thwarts
the
gleam
of
the
cast
a
blue
glare
on
their
faces
and
they
sat
and
gaped
and
glared
and
yelled
at
the
blast
suddenly
he
awoke
and
something
cried
now
thou
art
at
home
at
thjöttö
jack
and
when
he
had
come
to
himself
a
bit
he
recognised
where
he
was
he
was
lying
over
against
the
boulders
near
his
boathouse
at
home
the
tide
had
come
so
far
inland
that
a
border
of
foam
gleamed
right
up
in
the
and
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feet
for
the
blast
he
sat
him
down
in
the
boathouse
and
began
scratching
and
marking
out
the
shape
of
the
draugboat
in
the
black
darkness
till
sleep
overtook
him
when
it
was
light
in
the
morning
his
sister
came
down
to
him
with
a
she
did
greet
him
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
but
behaved
as
if
it
were
the
usual
thing
for
her
to
come
thus
every
morning
but
when
he
began
telling
her
all
about
his
voyage
to
finmark
and
the
and
the
draugboat
he
had
come
home
in
at
night
he
perceived
that
she
only
grinned
and
let
him
chatter
and
all
that
day
he
talked
about
it
to
his
sister
and
his
brothers
and
his
mother
until
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
they
thought
him
a
little
out
of
his
wits
when
he
mentioned
the
draugboat
they
smiled
amongst
themselves
and
evidently
went
out
of
their
way
to
humour
him
but
they
might
believe
what
they
liked
if
only
he
could
carry
out
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
be
left
to
himself
in
the
old
boathouse
one
should
go
with
the
stream
thought
jack
and
if
they
thought
him
crazy
and
out
of
his
wits
he
ought
to
behave
so
that
they
might
beware
of
interfering
with
him
and
disturbing
him
in
his
work
so
he
took
a
bed
of
skins
with
him
down
to
the
boathouse
and
slept
there
at
night
but
in
the
daytime
he
perched
himself
on
a
pole
on
the
roof
and
bellowed
out
that
now
he
was
sailing
sometimes
he
rode
astraddle
on
the
roof
ridge
and
dug
his
deep
into
the
rafters
so
that
people
might
think
he
fancied
himself
at
sea
holding
fast
on
to
the
keel
of
a
boat
whenever
folks
passed
by
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
turned
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
so
hideously
that
every
one
who
saw
him
was
quite
scared
as
for
the
people
at
home
it
was
as
much
as
they
dared
to
stick
his
into
the
boathouse
for
him
so
they
sent
it
to
him
by
his
youngest
sister
merry
little
malfri
who
would
sit
and
talk
with
him
and
thought
it
such
fun
when
he
made
toys
and
playthings
for
her
and
talked
about
the
boat
which
should
go
like
a
bird
and
sail
as
no
other
boat
had
ever
sailed
if
any
one
chanced
to
come
upon
him
unexpectedly
and
tried
to
peep
and
see
what
he
was
about
in
the
boathouse
there
he
would
creep
up
into
the
and
bang
and
pitch
the
boards
and
planks
about
so
that
they
did
know
exactly
where
to
find
him
and
were
glad
enough
to
be
off
but
one
and
all
made
haste
to
climb
over
the
hill
again
when
they
heard
him
fling
himself
down
at
full
length
and
send
peal
after
peal
of
laughter
after
them
so
that
was
how
jack
got
folks
to
leave
him
at
peace
he
worked
best
at
night
when
the
storm
tore
and
tugged
at
the
stones
and
birchbark
of
the
turf
roof
and
the
came
right
up
to
the
boathouse
door
when
it
piped
and
whined
through
the
fissured
walls
and
the
fine
snowflakes
flitted
through
the
cracks
the
model
of
the
draugboat
stood
plainest
before
him
the
winter
days
were
short
and
the
wick
of
the
lamp
which
hung
over
him
as
he
worked
cast
deep
shadows
so
that
the
darkness
came
soon
and
lasted
a
long
way
into
the
morning
when
he
sought
sleep
in
his
bed
of
skins
with
a
heap
of
shavings
for
his
pillow
he
spared
no
pains
or
trouble
if
there
was
a
board
which
would
not
run
into
the
right
groove
with
the
others
though
never
so
little
he
would
take
out
a
whole
row
of
them
and
plane
them
all
round
again
and
again
now
one
night
just
before
christmas
he
had
finished
all
but
the
uppermost
planking
and
the
gabs
he
was
working
so
hard
to
finish
up
that
he
took
no
count
of
time
the
plane
was
sending
the
shavings
flying
their
briskest
when
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
at
something
black
which
was
moving
along
the
plank
it
was
a
large
and
hideous
fly
which
was
crawling
about
and
feeling
and
poking
all
the
planks
in
the
boat
when
it
reached
the
lowest
it
whirred
with
its
wings
and
buzzed
then
it
rose
and
swept
above
it
in
the
air
till
all
at
once
it
swerved
away
into
the
darkness
jack
heart
sank
within
him
such
doubt
and
anguish
came
upon
him
he
knew
well
enough
that
no
good
errand
had
brought
the
buzzing
over
the
boat
like
that
so
he
took
the
lamp
and
a
wooden
club
and
began
to
test
the
prow
and
light
up
the
boarding
and
thump
it
well
and
go
over
the
planks
one
by
one
and
in
this
way
he
went
over
every
bit
of
the
boat
from
stem
to
stern
both
above
and
below
there
was
not
a
nail
or
a
rivet
that
he
really
believed
in
now
but
now
neither
the
shape
nor
the
proportions
of
the
boat
pleased
him
any
more
the
prow
was
too
big
and
the
whole
cut
of
the
boat
all
the
way
down
the
gunwale
had
something
of
a
twist
and
a
bend
and
a
swerve
about
it
so
that
it
looked
like
the
halves
of
two
different
boats
put
together
and
the
half
in
front
did
fit
in
with
the
half
behind
as
he
was
about
to
look
into
the
matter
still
further
and
he
felt
the
cold
sweat
bursting
out
of
the
roots
of
his
hair
the
lamp
went
out
and
left
him
in
blank
darkness
then
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
lifted
his
club
and
burst
open
the
boathouse
door
and
snatching
up
a
big
he
began
to
swing
it
about
him
and
ring
and
ring
with
it
through
the
black
night
art
chiming
for
me
jack
something
asked
there
was
a
sound
behind
him
like
the
surf
sucking
at
the
shore
and
a
cold
blast
blew
into
the
boathouse
there
on
the
sat
some
one
in
a
sloppy
grey
and
with
a
print
cap
drawn
down
over
its
ears
so
that
its
skull
looked
like
a
low
tassel
jack
gave
a
great
start
this
was
the
very
being
he
had
been
thinking
of
in
his
wild
rage
then
he
took
the
large
baling
can
and
flung
it
at
the
draug
but
right
through
the
draug
it
went
and
rattled
against
the
wall
behind
and
back
again
it
came
whizzing
about
jack
ears
and
if
it
had
struck
him
he
would
never
have
got
up
again
the
old
fellow
however
only
blinked
his
eyes
a
little
savagely
fie
cried
jack
and
spat
at
the
uncanny
thing
and
back
into
his
face
again
he
got
as
good
as
he
gave
there
you
have
your
wet
clout
back
again
cried
a
laughing
voice
but
the
same
instant
jack
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
a
whole
establishment
on
the
and
there
ready
and
rigged
out
on
the
bright
water
lay
an
so
long
and
shapely
and
shining
that
his
eyes
could
not
feast
on
it
enough
the
old
blinked
with
satisfaction
his
eyes
became
more
and
more
glowing
if
i
could
guide
you
back
to
helgeland
said
he
i
could
put
you
in
the
way
of
gaining
your
bread
too
but
you
must
pay
me
a
little
tax
for
it
in
every
seventh
boat
you
build
is
who
must
put
in
the
jack
felt
as
if
he
were
choking
he
felt
that
the
boat
was
dragging
him
into
the
very
jaws
of
an
abomination
or
do
you
fancy
you
worm
the
trick
out
of
me
for
nothing
said
the
gaping
grinning
draug
then
there
was
a
whirring
sound
as
if
something
heavy
was
hovering
about
the
boathouse
and
there
was
a
laugh
if
you
want
the
boat
you
must
take
the
boat
along
with
it
if
you
knock
three
times
on
the
with
the
club
you
shall
have
such
help
in
building
boats
that
the
like
of
them
will
not
be
found
in
all
nordland
twice
did
jack
raise
his
club
that
night
and
twice
he
laid
it
aside
again
but
the
ottring
lay
and
frisked
and
sported
in
the
sea
before
his
eyes
just
as
he
had
seen
it
all
bright
and
new
with
fresh
tar
and
with
the
ropes
and
fishing
gear
just
put
in
he
kicked
and
shook
the
fine
slim
boat
with
his
foot
just
to
see
how
light
and
high
she
could
rise
on
the
waves
above
the
and
once
twice
thrice
the
club
smote
against
the
so
that
was
how
the
first
boat
was
built
at
sjöholm
thick
as
birds
together
stood
a
countless
number
of
people
on
the
headland
in
the
autumn
watching
jack
and
his
brothers
putting
out
in
the
new
ottring
it
glided
through
the
strong
current
so
that
the
foam
was
like
a
foss
all
round
it
now
it
was
gone
and
now
it
ducked
up
again
like
a
and
past
skerries
and
capes
it
whizzed
like
a
dart
out
in
the
fishing
grounds
the
folks
rested
upon
their
oars
and
gaped
such
a
boat
they
had
never
seen
before
but
if
in
the
first
year
it
was
an
ottring
next
year
it
was
a
broad
heavy
for
winter
fishing
which
made
the
folks
open
their
eyes
and
every
boat
that
jack
turned
out
was
lighter
to
row
and
swifter
to
sail
than
the
one
before
it
but
the
largest
and
finest
of
all
was
the
last
that
stood
on
the
stocks
on
the
shore
this
was
the
jack
walked
to
and
fro
and
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
but
when
he
came
down
to
see
it
in
the
morning
it
seemed
to
him
oddly
enough
to
have
grown
in
the
night
and
what
is
more
was
such
a
wondrous
beauty
that
he
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
there
it
lay
ready
at
last
and
folks
were
never
tired
of
talking
about
it
now
the
bailiff
who
ruled
over
all
helgeland
in
those
days
was
an
unjust
man
who
laid
heavy
taxes
upon
the
people
taking
double
weight
and
tale
both
of
fish
and
of
nor
was
he
less
grasping
with
the
tithes
and
grain
dues
wherever
his
fellows
came
they
fleeced
and
flayed
no
sooner
then
did
the
rumour
of
the
new
boats
reach
him
than
he
sent
his
people
out
to
see
what
truth
was
in
it
for
he
himself
used
to
go
fishing
in
the
fishing
grounds
with
large
crews
when
thus
his
fellows
came
back
and
told
him
what
they
had
seen
the
bailiff
was
so
taken
with
it
that
he
drove
straightway
over
to
sjöholm
and
one
fine
day
down
he
came
swooping
on
jack
like
a
hawk
neither
tithe
nor
tax
hast
thou
paid
for
thy
livelihood
so
now
thou
shalt
be
fined
as
many
of
silver
as
thou
hast
made
boats
said
he
ever
louder
and
fiercer
grew
his
rage
jack
should
be
put
in
chains
and
irons
and
be
transported
northwards
to
the
fortress
of
skraar
and
be
kept
so
close
that
he
should
never
see
sun
or
moon
more
but
when
the
bailiff
had
rowed
round
the
and
feasted
his
eyes
upon
it
and
seen
how
smart
and
shapely
it
was
he
agreed
at
last
to
let
mercy
go
before
justice
and
was
content
to
take
the
in
lieu
of
a
fine
then
jack
took
off
his
cap
and
said
that
if
there
was
one
man
more
than
another
to
whom
he
would
like
to
give
the
boat
it
was
his
honour
the
bailiff
so
off
the
magistrate
sailed
with
it
jack
mother
and
sister
and
brothers
cried
bitterly
at
the
loss
of
the
beautiful
but
jack
stood
on
the
roof
of
the
and
laughed
fit
to
split
and
towards
autumn
the
news
spread
that
the
bailiff
with
his
eight
men
had
gone
down
with
the
in
the
but
in
those
days
there
was
quite
a
changing
about
of
boats
all
over
nordland
and
jack
was
unable
to
build
a
tenth
part
of
the
boats
required
of
him
folks
from
near
and
far
hung
about
the
walls
of
his
and
it
was
quite
a
favour
on
his
part
to
take
orders
and
agree
to
carry
them
out
a
whole
score
of
boats
soon
stood
beneath
the
on
the
strand
he
no
longer
troubled
his
head
about
every
boat
or
cared
to
know
which
it
was
or
what
befell
it
if
a
boat
foundered
now
and
then
so
many
the
more
got
off
and
did
well
so
that
on
the
whole
he
made
a
very
good
thing
indeed
out
of
it
besides
surely
folks
could
pick
and
choose
their
own
boats
and
take
which
they
liked
best
but
jack
got
so
great
and
mighty
that
it
was
not
advisable
for
any
one
to
thwart
him
or
interfere
where
he
ruled
and
reigned
whole
rows
of
silver
dollars
stood
in
the
barrels
in
the
loft
and
his
establishment
stretched
over
all
the
islands
of
sjöholm
one
sunday
his
brothers
and
merry
little
malfri
had
gone
to
church
in
the
when
evening
came
and
they
had
come
home
the
boatman
came
in
and
said
that
some
one
had
better
sail
out
and
look
after
them
as
a
gale
was
blowing
up
jack
was
sitting
with
a
in
his
hand
taking
the
measurements
of
a
new
boat
which
was
to
be
bigger
and
statelier
than
any
of
the
others
so
that
it
was
not
well
to
disturb
him
do
you
fancy
they
gone
out
in
a
rotten
old
tub
then
bellowed
he
and
the
boatman
was
driven
out
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
but
at
night
jack
lay
awake
and
listened
the
wind
whined
outside
and
shook
the
walls
and
there
were
cries
from
the
sea
far
away
and
just
then
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
some
one
called
him
by
name
go
back
whence
you
came
cried
he
and
nestled
more
snugly
in
his
bed
shortly
afterwards
there
came
the
fumbling
and
the
scratching
of
tiny
fingers
at
the
door
ca
you
leave
me
at
peace
o
nights
he
bawled
or
must
i
build
me
another
bedroom
but
the
knocking
and
the
fumbling
for
the
latch
outside
continued
and
there
was
a
sweeping
sound
at
the
door
as
of
some
one
who
could
not
open
it
and
there
was
a
stretching
of
hands
towards
the
latch
ever
higher
and
higher
but
jack
only
lay
there
and
laughed
the
that
are
built
at
sjöholm
do
go
down
before
the
first
blast
that
blows
mocked
he
then
the
latch
chopped
and
hopped
till
the
door
flew
wide
open
and
in
the
doorway
stood
pretty
malfri
and
her
mother
and
brothers
the
shone
about
them
and
they
were
dripping
with
water
their
faces
were
pale
and
blue
and
pinched
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
as
if
they
had
just
gone
through
their
death
agony
malfri
had
one
stiff
arm
round
her
mother
neck
it
was
all
torn
and
bleeding
just
as
when
she
had
gripped
her
for
the
last
time
she
railed
and
lamented
and
begged
back
her
young
life
from
him
so
now
he
knew
what
had
befallen
them
out
into
the
dark
night
and
the
darker
weather
he
went
straightway
to
search
for
them
with
as
many
boats
and
folk
as
he
could
get
together
they
sailed
and
searched
in
every
direction
and
it
was
in
vain
but
towards
day
the
came
drifting
homewards
bottom
upwards
and
with
a
large
hole
in
the
then
he
knew
who
had
done
the
deed
but
since
the
night
when
the
whole
of
jack
family
went
down
things
were
very
different
at
sjöholm
in
the
daytime
so
long
as
the
hammering
and
the
banging
and
the
planing
and
the
clinching
rang
about
his
ears
things
went
along
swimmingly
and
the
frames
of
boat
after
boat
rose
thick
as
sea
fowl
on
an
but
no
sooner
was
it
quiet
of
an
evening
than
he
had
company
his
mother
bustled
and
banged
about
the
house
and
opened
and
shut
drawers
and
cupboards
and
the
stairs
creaked
with
the
heavy
tread
of
his
brothers
going
up
to
their
bedrooms
at
night
no
sleep
visited
his
eyes
and
sure
enough
pretty
malfri
came
to
his
door
and
sighed
and
groaned
then
he
would
lie
awake
there
and
think
and
reckon
up
how
many
boats
with
false
he
might
have
sent
to
sea
and
the
longer
he
reckoned
the
more
he
made
of
it
then
he
would
plump
out
of
bed
and
creep
through
the
dark
night
down
to
the
boathouse
there
he
held
a
light
beneath
the
boats
and
banged
and
tested
all
the
with
a
club
to
see
if
he
could
hit
upon
the
but
he
neither
heard
nor
felt
a
single
board
give
way
one
was
just
like
another
they
were
all
hard
and
supple
and
the
wood
when
he
scraped
off
the
tar
was
white
and
fresh
one
night
he
was
so
tormented
by
an
uneasiness
about
the
new
which
lay
down
by
the
bridge
ready
to
set
off
next
morning
that
he
had
no
peace
till
he
went
down
and
tested
its
with
his
club
but
while
he
sat
in
the
boat
and
was
bending
over
the
thwart
with
a
light
there
was
a
gulping
sound
out
at
sea
and
then
came
such
a
vile
stench
of
rottenness
the
same
instant
he
heard
a
wading
sound
as
of
many
people
coming
ashore
and
then
up
over
the
headland
he
saw
a
crew
coming
along
they
were
all
creatures
and
they
all
leaned
right
forward
and
stretched
out
their
arms
before
them
whatever
came
in
their
way
both
stone
and
stour
they
went
right
through
it
and
there
was
neither
sound
nor
shriek
behind
them
came
another
boat
crew
big
and
little
grown
men
and
little
children
rattling
and
creaking
and
crew
after
crew
came
ashore
and
took
the
path
leading
to
the
headland
when
the
moon
peeped
forth
jack
could
see
right
into
their
skeletons
their
faces
glared
and
their
mouths
gaped
open
with
glistening
teeth
as
if
they
had
been
swallowing
water
they
came
in
heaps
and
shoals
one
after
the
other
the
place
quite
swarmed
with
them
then
jack
perceived
that
here
were
all
they
whom
he
had
tried
to
count
and
reckon
up
as
he
lay
in
bed
and
a
fit
of
fury
came
upon
him
he
rose
in
the
boat
and
spanked
his
leather
breeches
behind
and
cried
you
would
have
been
even
more
than
you
are
already
if
jack
had
built
his
boats
but
now
like
an
icy
whizzing
blast
they
all
came
down
upon
him
staring
at
him
with
their
hollow
eyes
they
gnashed
their
teeth
and
each
one
of
them
sighed
and
groaned
for
his
lost
life
then
jack
in
his
horror
put
out
from
sjöholm
but
the
sail
slackened
and
he
glided
into
dead
water
there
in
the
midst
of
the
still
water
was
a
floating
mass
of
rotten
swollen
planks
all
of
them
had
once
been
shaped
and
fashioned
together
but
were
now
burst
and
sprung
and
slime
and
green
mould
and
filth
and
nastiness
hung
about
them
dead
hands
grabbed
at
the
corners
of
them
with
their
white
knuckles
and
could
grip
fast
they
stretched
themselves
across
the
water
and
sank
again
then
jack
let
out
all
his
clews
and
sailed
and
sailed
and
tacked
according
as
the
wind
blew
he
glared
back
at
the
rubbish
behind
him
to
see
if
those
were
after
him
down
in
the
sea
all
the
dead
hands
were
writhing
and
tried
to
strike
him
with
gaffs
astern
then
there
came
a
gust
of
wind
whining
and
howling
and
the
boat
drove
along
betwixt
white
seething
rollers
the
weather
darkened
thick
snowflakes
filled
the
air
and
the
rubbish
around
him
grew
greener
in
the
daytime
he
took
the
cormorants
far
away
in
the
grey
mist
for
his
landmarks
and
at
night
they
screeched
about
his
ears
and
the
birds
flitted
and
flitted
continually
but
jack
sat
still
and
looked
out
upon
the
hideous
cormorants
at
last
the
lifted
a
little
and
the
air
began
to
be
alive
with
bright
black
buzzing
flies
the
sun
burned
and
far
away
inland
the
snowy
plains
blazed
in
its
light
he
recognised
very
well
the
headland
and
shore
where
he
was
now
able
to
lay
to
the
smoke
came
from
the
gamme
up
on
the
there
in
the
doorway
sat
the
he
was
lifting
his
pointed
cap
up
and
down
up
and
down
by
means
of
a
thread
of
sinew
which
went
right
through
him
so
that
his
skin
creaked
and
up
there
also
sure
enough
was
seimke
she
looked
old
and
angular
as
she
bent
over
the
that
she
was
spreading
out
in
the
sunny
weather
but
she
peeped
beneath
her
arm
as
quick
and
nimble
as
a
cat
with
kittens
and
the
sun
shone
upon
her
and
lit
up
her
face
and
hair
she
leaped
up
so
briskly
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
looked
down
at
him
her
dog
barked
but
she
quieted
it
so
that
the
should
mark
nothing
then
a
strange
longing
came
over
him
and
he
put
ashore
he
stood
beside
her
and
she
threw
her
arms
over
her
head
and
laughed
and
shook
and
nestled
close
up
to
him
and
cried
and
pleaded
and
know
what
to
do
with
herself
and
ducked
down
upon
his
bosom
and
threw
herself
on
his
neck
and
kissed
and
fondled
him
and
would
let
him
go
but
the
had
noticed
that
there
was
something
amiss
and
sat
all
the
time
in
his
furs
and
mumbled
and
muttered
to
the
so
that
jack
dare
not
get
between
him
and
the
doorway
the
finn
was
angry
since
there
had
been
such
a
changing
about
of
boats
over
all
nordland
and
there
was
no
more
sale
for
his
fair
winds
he
was
quite
ruined
he
complained
he
was
now
so
poor
that
he
would
very
soon
have
to
go
about
and
beg
his
bread
and
of
all
his
reindeer
he
had
only
a
single
doe
left
who
went
about
there
by
the
house
then
seimke
crept
behind
jack
and
whispered
to
him
to
bid
for
this
doe
then
she
put
the
around
her
and
stood
inside
the
gamme
door
in
the
smoke
so
that
the
only
saw
the
grey
skin
and
fancied
it
was
the
reindeer
they
were
bringing
in
then
jack
laid
his
hand
upon
seimke
neck
and
began
to
bid
the
pointed
cap
ducked
and
nodded
and
the
finn
spat
in
the
warm
air
but
sell
his
reindeer
he
would
not
jack
raised
his
price
but
the
finn
heaved
up
the
ashes
all
about
him
and
threatened
and
shrieked
the
flies
came
as
thick
as
the
finn
furry
wrappings
were
alive
with
them
jack
bid
and
bid
till
it
reached
a
whole
bushel
load
of
silver
and
the
finn
was
ready
to
jump
out
of
his
skins
then
he
stuck
his
head
under
his
furs
again
and
mumbled
and
till
the
amount
rose
to
seven
bushels
of
silver
then
the
laughed
till
he
nearly
split
he
thought
the
reindeer
would
cost
the
purchaser
a
pretty
penny
but
jack
lifted
seimke
up
and
sprang
down
with
her
to
his
boat
and
held
the
behind
him
against
the
and
they
put
off
from
land
and
went
to
sea
seimke
was
so
happy
and
smote
her
hands
together
and
took
her
turn
at
the
oars
the
northern
light
shot
out
like
a
comb
all
and
fiery
and
licked
and
played
upon
her
face
she
talked
to
it
and
fought
it
with
her
hands
and
her
eyes
sparkled
she
used
both
tongue
and
mouth
and
rapid
gestures
as
she
exchanged
words
with
it
then
it
grew
dark
and
she
lay
on
his
bosom
so
that
he
could
feel
her
warm
breath
her
black
hair
lay
right
over
him
and
she
was
as
soft
and
warm
to
the
touch
as
a
ptarmigan
when
it
is
frightened
and
its
blood
throbs
jack
put
the
over
seimke
and
the
boat
rocked
them
to
and
fro
on
the
heavy
sea
as
if
it
were
a
cradle
they
sailed
on
and

they
sailed

for
the
last
two
or
three
days
the
weather
had
been
terrific
but
on
the
third
day
it
so
far
cleared
up
that
one
of
the
men
who
belonged
to
the
fishing
station
thought
that
they
might
manage
to
drag
the
nets
a
bit
that
day
the
others
however
were
not
inclined
to
venture
out
now
it
is
the
custom
for
the
various
crews
to
lend
each
other
a
hand
in
pushing
off
the
boats
and
so
it
happened
now
when
however
they
came
to
the
which
was
drawn
up
a
good
distance
ashore
they
found
the
oars
and
the
thwarts
turned
upside
down
in
the
boat
and
more
than
that
despite
all
their
exertions
it
was
impossible
to
move
the
boat
from
the
spot
they
tried
once
twice
thrice
but
it
was
of
no
use
but
then
one
of
them
who
was
known
to
have
second
sight
said
that
from
what
he
saw
it
would
be
best
not
to
touch
the
boat
at
all
that
day
it
was
too
heavy
for
the
might
of
man
to
move
one
of
the
crew
however
who
belonged
to
the
he
was
a
smart
lad
of
fourteen
was
amusing
them
all
the
time
with
all
manner
of
pranks
and
tomfoolery
he
now
caught
up
a
heavy
stone
and
pitched
it
with
all
his
might
right
into
the
stern
of
the
boat
then
suddenly
and
plainly
visible
to
them
all
out
of
the
boat
rushed
a
draug
in
seaman
clothes
but
with
a
heavy
crop
of
seaweed
instead
of
a
head
it
had
been
weighing
down
the
boat
by
sitting
in
the
stern
and
now
dashed
into
the
sea
so
that
the
foam
spirted
all
over
them
after
that
the
glided
quite
smoothly
into
the
water
then
the
man
with
second
sight
looked
at
the
boy
and
said
that
he
should
not
have
done
so
but
the
lad
went
on
laughing
as
before
and
said
he
did
believe
in
such
stuff
when
they
had
come
home
in
the
evening
and
the
folks
lay
sleeping
in
the
they
heard
about
twelve
at
night
the
lad
yelling
for
help
it
even
seemed
to
one
of
them
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
as
if
a
heavy
hand
were
stretching
forward
from
the
door
right
up
to
the
bench
on
which
the
lad
lay
the
lad
yelling
and
struggling
had
already
been
dragged
as
far
as
the
door
before
the
others
had
so
far
come
to
their
senses
as
to
think
of
grasping
him
round
the
body
to
prevent
him
from
being
dragged
right
out
and
now
in
mid
doorway
a
hard
fight
began
the
draug
dragging
him
by
the
legs
while
the
whole
crew
tugged
against
him
with
the
boy
arms
and
upper
limbs
thus
amidst
yelling
and
groaning
they
swayed
to
and
fro
all
through
the
midnight
hour
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
door
and
now
the
draug
and
now
the
men
had
the
most
of
the
boy
on
their
side
of
the
doorway
all
at
once
the
draug
let
go
so
that
the
whole
crew
fell
backwards
on
to
the
floor
then
they
found
that
the
boy
was
dead
it
was
only
then
that
the
draug
had
let
him
go

there
was
once
a
young
salesman
at
the
storekeeper
at
sörvaag
he
was
fair
with
curly
hair
shrewd
blue
eyes
and
so
smart
and
obliging
and
handsome
that
all
the
girls
in
the
town
got
themselves
sent
on
errands
and
made
pilgrimages
to
the
shop
on
purpose
to
see
him
moreover
he
was
so
smart
and
skilful
in
everything
he
put
his
hand
to
that
the
storekeeper
never
would
part
with
him
now
it
happened
one
day
that
he
went
out
to
a
fishing
station
for
his
principal
the
current
was
dead
against
him
so
he
rode
close
in
shore
all
at
once
he
saw
a
little
ring
in
the
rocky
wall
a
little
above
mark
he
thought
it
was
the
sort
of
ring
which
is
used
for
fastening
boats
to
so
he
fancied
it
would
do
any
harm
to
rest
a
bit
and
lay
to
ashore
and
have
a
snack
of
something
for
he
had
been
pulling
at
the
oars
from
early
morn
but
when
he
took
hold
of
the
ring
to
run
his
boatline
through
it
it
fitted
round
his
finger
so
tightly
that
he
had
to
tug
at
it
he
tugged
and
out
of
the
mountain
side
with
a
rush
came
a
large
drawer
it
was
brimful
of
silk
neckerchiefs
and
women
frippery
he
was
amazed
and
began
pondering
the
matter
over
then
he
saw
what
looked
like
rusty
flakes
of
iron
in
rows
right
over
the
whole
mountain
side
exactly
resembling
the
slit
of
his
own
drawer
he
had
now
got
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
must
needs
try
if
it
would
open
the
other
slits
also
and
out
he
drew
drawer
after
drawer
full
of
gold
bracelets
and
silver
bracelets
glass
pearls
brooches
and
rings
bracelets
and
laced
caps
yarn
and
woollen
drawers
coffee
sugar
groats
tobacco
pipes
buttons
hooks
and
eyes
knives
axes
and
scythes
he
drew
out
drawer
after
drawer
there
was
no
end
to
the
display
they
made
but
all
round
about
him
he
heard
as
it
were
the
humming
of
a
crowd
and
the
tramp
of
there
was
a
hubbub
as
if
they
were
rolling
hogsheads
over
a
bridge
and
hoisting
sails
against
the
wind
and
out
from
the
sea
sounded
the
stroke
of
oars
and
the
bumping
of
boats
putting
ashore
then
he
began
to
have
an
inkling
that
he
had
laid
to
his
boat
at
a
belonging
to
the
underground
folk
and
had
lit
right
upon
their
where
they
deposited
their
wares
he
stood
there
looking
into
a
drawer
of
meerschaum
pipes
they
were
finer
than
any
he
had
thought
it
possible
to
find
in
the
whole
world
then
he
felt
as
it
were
the
blow
of
a
heavy
hand
which
tried
to
thrust
him
aside
but
at
the
same
time
some
one
laughed
so
merrily
close
by
the
same
instant
he
saw
a
young
woman
in
the
of
his
boat
she
was
leaning
with
broad
shoulders
and
hairy
arms
over
a
her
eyes
laughed
and
shot
forth
sparks
as
from
a
smithy
in
the
dark
but
her
face
was
oddly
pale
then
she
vanished
altogether
like
a
vision
he
was
glad
when
he
got
down
into
his
boat
again
and
pushed
off
and
rode
away
but
when
he
got
out
into
the
sound
and
slackened
speed
a
bit
he
perceived
that
the
ring
still
sat
upon
his
finger
his
first
thought
was
to
tear
it
off
and
fling
it
into
the
sea
but
then
it
sat
tighter
than
ever
it
was
so
curiously
wrought
and
fretted
and
engraved
that
he
must
needs
examine
it
more
curiously
and
the
longer
he
looked
at
it
the
stranger
the
gold
whereof
it
was
wrought
gleamed
and
glistened
turn
it
as
he
would
to
examine
its
spirals
he
could
never
make
out
where
they
began
and
where
they
ended
but
as
he
sat
there
and
looked
and
looked
at
it
the
black
crackling
and
sparkling
eyes
of
that
pale
face
stood
out
more
and
more
plainly
before
his
eyes
he
did
exactly
know
whether
he
thought
her
ugly
or
handsome
the
uncanny
creature
the
ring
he
now
meant
to
keep
come
what
might
and
home
he
rowed
and
said
not
a
word
to
anybody
of
what
had
happened
to
him
but
from
that
day
forth
a
strange
restlessness
came
over
him
when
he
was
sweeping
out
the
shop
or
measuring
goods
he
would
suddenly
stand
there
in
a
brown
study
and
fancy
he
was
right
away
at
the
in
the
and
the
black
woman
was
laughing
at
him
over
the
out
yonder
he
must
needs
venture
once
more
and
put
his
ring
to
the
test
though
it
cost
him
his
life
and
in
the
course
of
the
summer
his
boat
lay
over
at
the
in
the
place
as
before
when
he
had
opened
the
drawer
with
his
gold
ring
he
caught
sight
of
the
woman
her
eyes
sparkled
and
had
a
wild
look
about
them
and
she
peered
curiously
at
him
and
every
time
he
came
he
seemed
to
be
more
expected
and
she
was
more
and
more
gladsome
they
became
quite
old
acquaintances
and
she
was
always
waiting
for
him
there
but
at
home
he
grew
gloomy
and
silent
yet
although
he
bethought
him
that
it
was
all
sorcery
and
her
arms
were
hairy
almost
like
a
beast
and
although
he
determined
and
really
tried
to
keep
away
nevertheless
he
could
not
help
going
thither
and
whenever
he
had
been
away
from
her
a
whole
week
she
grew
quite
unmanageable
and
laughed
and
shrieked
when
she
saw
him
coming
again
and
he
always
heard
the
noise
and
the
bustle
of
many
people
all
about
him
but
never
could
he
see
anything
it
seemed
to
him
however
as
if
they
all
lay
a
little
way
off
and
pulled
their
boat
aside
for
him
to
pass
his
boat
too
was
always
nicely
baled
out
and
the
oars
and
sails
righted
and
trimmed
the
cable
too
was
fastened
for
him
whenever
he
came
and
thrown
to
him
whenever
he
went
away
now
and
then
she
so
managed
it
that
he
caught
a
glimpse
into
their
warehouses
and
their
bright
halls
in
the
mountain
side
and
at
such
times
she
seemed
to
be
enticing
him
after
her
and
then
on
his
way
home
he
would
shudder
what
thought
he
if
the
mountain
wall
were
to
shut
to
behind
me
and
every
time
he
was
right
glad
that
he
had
been
so
far
on
his
guard
and
had
come
off
scot
free
and
now
towards
autumn
he
grew
more
at
his
ease
he
really
made
up
his
mind
to
try
to
give
up
these
journeys
he
set
to
work
in
real
earnest
so
that
he
had
no
time
for
thought
and
plunged
into
his
business
with
fiery
impetuosity
but
when
drew
nigh
with
its
snowflakes
and
darkness
such
strange
fancies
came
over
him
whenever
he
went
into
the
dark
draughty
nooks
and
corners
he
saw
the
strong
heavily
built
shape
before
him
she
laughed
and
called
to
him
and
shrieked
and
sent
him
messages
by
the
blast
and
then
a
strong
desire
came
upon
him
and
one
day
he
was
unable
to
hold
out
any
longer
so
off
he
went
he
fancied
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
a
long
way
off
she
was
casting
huge
boulders
aside
so
as
to
see
and
follow
the
course
of
the
boat
and
she
beckoned
and
greeted
him
through
the
drizzle
and
the
mist
it
was
as
though
the
current
was
bearing
him
thither
all
the
time
when
he
came
up
the
sea
seethed
and
boiled
for
the
crowds
that
were
in
it
though
he
saw
them
not
they
waded
out
to
him
and
drew
his
boat
ashore
and
steps
and
a
bridge
lay
there
ready
for
his
feet
but
right
at
the
top
stood
she
and
her
breath
came
heavily
and
she
leaned
towards
him
and
drew
him
with
those
bold
eyes
of
hers
set
in
that
face
as
pale
as
night
she
went
swiftly
inland
looked
behind
her
and
beckoned
him
after
her
and
then
she
threw
open
the
door
of
an
old
iron
safe
in
the
midst
of
the
wall
on
its
shelves
sparkled
a
bridal
crown
and
a
shining
girdle
and
breastplate
and
a
kirtle
and
all
manner
of
bridal
finery
there
she
stood
and
her
breath
came
straining
hot
and
heavy
through
her
white
teeth
and
she
smiled
and
ogled
him
archly
he
felt
her
take
hold
of
him
and
it
was
as
though
a
darkness
fell
around
him
then
all
at
once
as
if
in
a
gleam
of
twilight
he
saw
the
whole
vast
and
wealthy
and
splendid
all
round
about
him
with
its
haven
warehouses
and
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
pointed
to
it
as
if
she
would
say
that
he
should
be
the
lord
and
master
of
the
whole
of
it
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
him
he
perceived
that
it
led
right
into
the
mountain
and
out
he
rushed
he
cut
the
cable
through
with
his
knife
and
wrenched
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
and
off
he
rowed
so
that
the
sea
was
like
a
foaming
foss
around
him
when
he
got
home
to
his
work
again
and
the
bustle
of
the
christmas
season
began
he
felt
as
if
he
had
awakened
from
a
heavy
nightmare
or
an
evil
dream
he
felt
so
light
of
heart
he
chatted
gaily
with
customers
over
the
counter
and
his
old
life
went
on
much
the
same
as
before
and
everything
he
put
his
hand
to
went
along
as
smooth
as
butter
but
the
tradesman
daughter
stuck
her
head
into
the
shop
not
once
nor
twice
she
looked
and
smiled
at
him
in
shy
admiration
never
had
he
remarked
before
what
taking
ways
were
hers
or
noticed
how
bonnie
and
bright
the
lassie
was
and
how
graceful
and
supple
she
looked
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
ever
since
the
tradesman
daughter
had
looked
so
strangely
at
him
he
had
no
thought
for
any
one
but
her
he
was
always
thinking
what
a
way
she
had
of
holding
her
head
and
how
slim
she
looked
when
she
walked
about
and
what
quick
and
lively
blue
eyes
she
had
just
like
merry
twinkling
stars
he
would
lay
awake
o
nights
and
reflect
upon
his
grievous
abominable
sin
in
lowering
himself
to
the
level
of
an
uncanny
monster
and
right
glad
was
he
that
he
had
cast
the
ring
away
but
on
christmas
eve
when
the
shop
was
shut
and
the
house
folks
and
servants
were
making
ready
for
the
festival
in
kitchen
and
parlour
the
shopkeeper
took
him
aside
into
his
if
he
liked
his
daughter
said
he
there
was
no
impediment
that
he
could
see
let
him
take
heart
and
woo
her
for
it
had
escaped
him
how
she
was
moping
about
all
on
his
account
he
himself
said
the
shopkeeper
was
old
and
would
like
to
retire
from
business
the
shopman
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
he
wooed
straightway
and
before
the
christmas
cheer
was
on
the
table
he
got
yes
for
an
answer
then
years
and
years
passed
over
them
and
they
thrived
and
prospered
in
house
and
home
they
had
pretty
and
clever
children
he
rejoiced
in
his
wife
nothing
was
good
enough
for
her
and
honour
and
ease
were
her
portion
both
at
home
and
abroad
but
in
the
seventh
year
when
it
was
drawing
towards
such
a
strange
restlessness
came
over
him
he
wandered
about
all
by
himself
and
could
find
peace
nowhere
his
wife
fretted
and
sorrowed
over
it
she
knew
not
what
it
could
be
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
oddly
avoided
her
he
would
wander
for
hours
together
about
the
dark
packhouse
loft
among
coffers
and
casks
and
barrels
and
sacks
and
it
was
as
though
he
did
like
folks
to
come
thither
when
he
was
there
now
it
chanced
on
the
day
before
little
christmas
eve
that
one
of
the
workpeople
had
to
fetch
something
from
the
loft
there
stood
the
master
deep
in
thought
by
one
of
the
meal
sacks
staring
down
on
the
ground
before
him
do
you
see
the
iron
ring
down
in
the
floor
there
he
asked
but
the
man
saw
no
ring
i
see
it
there
the
earth
draws
he
sighed
heavily
on
little
christmas
eve
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
nor
on
the
day
after
though
they
searched
for
him
high
and
low
and
made
inquiries
about
him
everywhere
amidst
the
bustle
and
merriment
but
late
on
christmas
eve
while
they
were
all
running
about
in
the
utmost
anxiety
not
knowing
whether
they
should
lay
the
table
or
not
all
at
once
in
he
came
through
the
door
he
longed
so
much
for
both
meat
and
drink
he
said
and
he
was
so
happy
and
merry
and
jovial
the
whole
evening
through
that
they
all
clean
forgot
the
fright
they
had
been
in
for
a
whole
year
afterwards
he
was
chatty
and
sociable
as
before
and
he
made
so
much
of
his
wife
that
it
was
quite
absurd
he
bore
her
in
his
hands
so
to
speak
and
absolutely
could
not
do
enough
for
her
but
when
it
drew
towards
again
and
the
darkest
time
of
the
year
the
same
sort
of
restlessness
came
over
him
it
was
as
though
they
only
saw
his
shadow
amongst
them
and
he
went
moping
about
the
packhouse
loft
again
and
lingering
there
on
little
christmas
eve
the
same
thing
happened
as
before
he
disappeared
his
wife
and
the
people
of
the
house
went
about
in
a
terrible
way
and
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
alarm
and
on
christmas
eve
he
suddenly
stepped
into
the
room
again
and
was
merry
and
jovial
as
he
generally
was
but
when
the
lights
had
burnt
out
and
they
all
had
gone
to
bed
his
wife
could
hold
her
tongue
no
longer
she
burst
into
tears
and
begged
him
to
tell
her
where
he
had
been
then
he
thrust
her
roughly
from
him
and
his
eyes
shot
sparks
as
if
he
were
downright
crazy
he
implored
her
for
their
mutual
happiness
sake
never
to
ask
him
such
a
question
again
time
went
on
and
the
same
thing
happened
every
year
when
the
days
grew
dark
he
moped
about
by
himself
all
gloomy
and
silent
and
seemed
bent
upon
hiding
himself
away
from
people
and
on
little
christmas
eve
he
always
disappeared
though
nobody
ever
saw
him
go
and
punctually
on
christmas
eve
at
the
very
moment
when
they
were
about
to
lay
the
table
he
all
at
once
came
in
at
the
door
happy
and
contented
with
them
all
but
just
before
every
autumn
towards
the
dark
days
always
earlier
than
the
year
before
this
restlessness
came
over
him
and
he
moped
about
with
it
moodier
and
shyer
of
people
than
ever
his
wife
never
questioned
him
but
a
load
of
sorrow
lay
upon
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
to
grow
heavier
and
more
crushing
since
she
seemed
no
longer
able
to
take
care
of
him
and
he
no
longer
seemed
to
belong
to
her
now
one
year
when
it
was
again
drawing
nigh
to
he
began
roaming
about
as
usual
heavy
and
cast
down
and
the
day
before
little
christmas
eve
he
took
his
wife
along
with
him
into
the
packhouse
loft
do
you
see
anything
there
by
the
meal
sack
he
asked
but
she
saw
nothing
then
he
gripped
her
by
the
hand
and
begged
and
implored
her
to
remain
and
go
with
him
there
at
night
as
his
life
was
dear
to
him
said
he
he
would
fain
try
and
stay
at
home
that
day
in
the
course
of
the
night
he
tightly
grasped
her
hand
time
after
time
and
sighed
and
groaned
she
felt
that
he
was
holding
on
to
her
and
striving
hard
and
with
all
his
might
against
when
morning
came
it
was
all
over
he
was
happier
and
lighter
of
mood
than
she
had
seen
him
for
a
long
long
time
and
he
remained
at
home
on
that
christmas
eve
there
was
such
a
hauling
and
upstairs
from
both
shop
and
cellar
and
the
candles
shone
till
all
the
sparkled
again
it
was
the
first
real
festival
he
had
ever
spent
in
his
own
house
he
said
and
he
meant
to
make
a
regular
banquet
of
it
but
when
as
the
custom
was
the
people
of
the
house
came
in
one
by
one
and
drank
the
healths
of
their
master
and
mistress
he
grew
paler
and
paler
and
whiter
and
whiter
as
if
his
blood
were
being
sucked
out
of
him
and
drained
away
the
earth
draws
he
shrieked
and
there
was
a
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
immediately
afterwards
he
sat
there
dead
the
day
before
christmas
eve
cormorants
of
illustration
twelve
the
cormorants
of
andvær
outside
andvær
lies
an
island
the
haunt
of
wild
birds
which
no
man
can
land
upon
be
the
sea
never
so
quiet
the
girds
it
round
about
with
sucking
whirlpools
and
dashing
breakers
on
fine
summer
days
something
sparkles
there
through
the
like
a
large
gold
ring
and
time
out
of
mind
folks
have
fancied
there
was
a
treasure
there
left
by
some
pirates
of
old
at
sunset
sometimes
there
looms
forth
from
thence
a
vessel
with
a
castle
astern
and
a
glimpse
is
caught
now
and
then
of
an
galley
there
it
lies
as
if
in
a
tempest
and
carves
its
way
along
through
heavy
white
rollers
along
the
rocks
sit
the
cormorants
in
a
long
black
row
lying
in
wait
for
but
there
was
a
time
when
one
knew
the
exact
number
of
these
birds
there
was
never
more
nor
less
of
them
than
twelve
while
upon
a
stone
out
in
the
sat
the
thirteenth
but
it
was
only
visible
when
it
rose
and
flew
right
over
the
island
the
only
persons
who
lived
near
the
vær
at
winter
time
long
after
the
fishing
season
was
over
was
a
woman
and
a
slip
of
a
girl
their
business
was
to
guard
the
scaffolding
poles
for
drying
fish
against
the
birds
of
prey
who
had
such
a
villainous
trick
of
hacking
at
the
the
young
girl
had
thick
hair
and
a
pair
of
eyes
that
peeped
at
folk
so
oddly
one
might
almost
have
said
that
she
was
like
the
cormorants
outside
there
and
she
had
never
seen
much
else
all
her
life
nobody
knew
who
her
father
was
thus
they
lived
till
the
girl
had
grown
up
it
was
found
that
in
the
summer
time
when
the
fishermen
went
out
to
the
vær
to
fetch
away
the
dried
fish
that
the
young
fellows
began
underbidding
each
other
so
as
to
be
selected
for
that
special
errand
some
gave
up
their
share
of
profits
and
others
their
wages
and
there
was
a
general
complaint
in
all
the
villages
round
about
that
on
such
occasions
no
end
of
betrothals
were
broken
off
but
the
cause
of
it
all
was
the
girl
out
yonder
with
the
odd
eyes
for
all
her
rough
and
ready
ways
she
had
something
about
her
said
those
she
chatted
with
that
there
was
no
resisting
she
turned
the
heads
of
all
the
young
fellows
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
live
without
her
the
first
winter
a
lad
wooed
her
who
had
both
house
and
warehouse
of
his
own
if
you
come
again
in
the
summer
time
and
give
me
the
right
gold
ring
i
will
be
wedded
by
something
may
come
of
it
said
she
and
sure
enough
in
the
summer
time
the
lad
was
there
again
he
had
a
lot
of
fish
to
fetch
away
and
she
might
have
had
a
gold
ring
as
heavy
and
as
bonnie
as
heart
could
wish
for
the
ring
i
must
have
lies
beneath
the
wreckage
in
the
iron
chest
over
at
the
island
yonder
said
she
that
is
if
you
love
me
enough
to
dare
fetch
it
but
then
the
lad
grew
pale
he
saw
the
rise
and
fall
out
there
like
a
white
wall
of
foam
on
the
bright
warm
summer
day
and
on
the
island
sat
the
cormorants
sleeping
in
the
sunshine
dearly
do
i
love
thee
said
he
but
such
a
quest
as
that
would
mean
my
burial
not
my
bridal
the
same
instant
the
thirteenth
cormorant
rose
from
his
stone
in
the
misty
foam
and
flew
right
over
the
island
next
winter
the
steersman
of
a
yacht
came
a
wooing
for
two
years
he
had
gone
about
and
hugged
his
misery
for
her
sake
and
he
got
the
same
answer
if
you
come
again
in
the
summer
time
and
give
me
the
right
gold
ring
i
will
be
wedded
with
something
may
come
of
it
out
to
the
vær
he
came
again
on
midsummer
day
but
when
he
heard
where
the
gold
ring
lay
he
sat
and
wept
the
whole
day
till
evening
when
the
sun
began
to
dance
into
the
sea
then
the
thirteenth
cormorant
arose
and
flew
right
over
the
island
there
was
nasty
weather
during
the
third
winter
there
were
manifold
wrecks
and
on
the
keel
of
a
boat
which
came
driving
ashore
hung
an
exhausted
young
lad
by
his
but
they
could
get
the
life
back
into
him
roll
and
rub
him
about
in
the
as
they
might
then
the
girl
came
in
is
my
bridegroom
said
she
and
she
laid
him
in
her
bosom
and
sat
with
him
the
whole
night
through
and
put
warmth
into
his
heart
and
when
the
morning
came
his
heart
beat
methought
i
lay
betwixt
the
wings
of
a
cormorant
and
leaned
my
head
against
its
downy
breast
said
he
the
lad
was
ruddy
and
handsome
with
curly
hair
and
he
could
take
his
eyes
away
from
the
girl
he
took
work
upon
the
vær
but
off
he
must
needs
be
gadding
and
chatting
with
her
be
it
never
so
early
and
never
so
late
so
it
fared
with
him
as
it
had
fared
with
the
others
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
live
without
her
and
on
the
day
when
he
was
bound
to
depart
he
wooed
her
i
will
not
fool
said
she
thou
hast
lain
on
my
breast
and
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
thee
from
sorrow
thou
shalt
have
me
if
thou
wilt
place
the
betrothal
ring
upon
my
finger
but
longer
than
the
day
lasts
thou
canst
not
keep
me
and
now
i
will
wait
and
long
after
thee
with
a
horrible
longing
till
the
summer
comes
on
midsummer
day
the
youth
came
thither
in
his
boat
all
alone
then
she
told
him
of
the
ring
that
he
must
fetch
for
her
from
among
the
skerries
if
thou
hast
taken
me
off
the
keel
of
a
boat
thou
mayest
cast
me
forth
yonder
again
said
the
lad
live
without
thee
i
can
not
but
as
he
laid
hold
of
the
oars
in
order
to
row
out
she
stepped
into
the
boat
with
him
and
sat
in
the
stern
wondrous
fair
was
she
it
was
beautiful
summer
weather
and
there
was
a
swell
upon
the
sea
wave
followed
upon
wave
in
long
bright
rollers
the
lad
sat
there
lost
in
the
sight
of
her
and
he
rowed
and
rowed
till
the
insucking
breakers
roared
and
thundered
among
the
skerries
the
was
strong
and
the
frothing
foam
spurted
up
as
high
as
towers
if
thy
life
is
dear
to
thee
turn
back
now
said
she
thou
art
dearer
to
me
than
life
itself
he
made
answer
but
just
as
it
seemed
to
the
lad
as
if
the
prow
were
going
under
and
the
jaws
of
death
were
gaping
wide
before
him
it
grew
all
at
once
as
still
as
a
calm
and
the
boat
could
run
ashore
as
if
there
was
never
a
billow
there
on
the
island
lay
a
rusty
old
ship
anchor
half
out
of
the
sea
in
the
iron
chest
which
lies
beneath
the
anchor
is
my
dowry
said
she
carry
it
up
into
thy
boat
and
put
the
ring
that
thou
seest
on
my
finger
with
this
thou
dost
make
me
thy
bride
so
now
i
am
thine
till
the
sun
dances
into
the
sea
it
was
a
gold
ring
with
a
red
stone
in
it
and
he
put
it
on
her
finger
and
kissed
her
in
a
cleft
on
the
skerry
was
a
patch
of
green
grass
there
they
sat
them
down
and
they
were
ministered
to
in
wondrous
wise
how
he
knew
not
nor
cared
to
know
so
great
was
his
joy
midsummer
day
is
beauteous
said
she
and
i
am
young
and
thou
art
my
bridegroom
and
now
we
to
our
bridal
bed
so
bonnie
was
she
that
he
could
not
contain
himself
for
love
but
when
night
drew
nigh
and
the
sun
began
to
dance
out
into
the
sea
she
kissed
him
and
shed
tears
beauteous
is
the
summer
day
said
she
and
still
more
beauteous
is
the
summer
evening
but
now
the
dusk
cometh
and
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
she
were
becoming
older
and
older
and
fading
right
away
when
the
sun
went
below
the
there
lay
before
him
on
the
skerry
some
mouldering
linen
rags
and
nought
else
calm
was
the
sea
and
in
the
clear
midsummer
night
there
flew
cormorants
out
over
the
sea
a
where
fishermen
assemble
periodically
and
the
parson
of
illustration
parson
of
brönö
story
of
the
isaac
and
the
parson
of
brönö
in
helgeland
there
was
once
a
fisherman
called
isaac
one
day
when
he
was
out
halibut
fishing
he
felt
something
heavy
on
the
lines
he
drew
up
and
lo
there
was
a
that
a
rum
said
he
and
he
sat
there
a
long
time
looking
at
it
it
looked
just
as
if
it
might
be
the
boot
of
his
brother
who
had
gone
down
in
the
great
storm
last
winter
on
his
way
home
from
fishing
there
was
still
something
the
boot
too
but
he
durst
not
look
to
see
what
it
was
nor
did
he
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
the
either
he
did
want
to
take
it
home
and
frighten
his
mother
nor
did
he
quite
fancy
chucking
it
back
into
the
sea
again
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
parson
of
brönö
and
beg
him
to
bury
it
in
a
christian
way
but
i
ca
bury
a
quoth
the
parson
the
fellow
scratched
his
head
na
na
said
he
then
he
wanted
to
know
how
much
there
ought
to
be
of
a
human
body
before
it
could
have
the
benefit
of
christian
burial
that
i
can
not
exactly
tell
you
said
the
parson
a
tooth
or
a
finger
or
hair
clippings
is
not
enough
to
read
the
burial
service
over
anyhow
there
ought
to
be
so
much
remaining
that
one
can
see
that
a
soul
has
been
in
it
but
to
read
holy
scripture
over
a
toe
or
two
in
a
oh
no
that
would
never
do
but
isaac
watched
his
opportunity
and
managed
to
get
the
into
the
churchyard
on
the
sly
all
the
same
and
home
he
went
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
it
was
better
after
all
that
of
his
brother
should
lie
so
near
house
than
that
he
should
have
heaved
the
boot
back
into
the
black
sea
again
but
towards
autumn
it
so
happened
that
as
he
lay
out
among
the
skerries
on
the
for
seals
and
the
drove
masses
of
tangled
seaweed
towards
him
he
fished
up
a
and
an
empty
sheath
with
his
he
recognised
them
at
once
as
his
brother
the
tarred
wire
covering
of
the
sheath
had
been
loosened
and
bleached
by
the
sea
and
he
remembered
quite
well
how
when
his
brother
had
sat
and
cobbled
away
at
this
sheath
he
had
chatted
and
argued
with
him
about
the
leather
for
his
belt
which
he
had
taken
from
an
old
horse
which
they
had
lately
killed
they
had
bought
the
buckle
together
over
at
the
storekeeper
on
the
saturday
and
mother
had
sold
bilberries
and
capercailzies
and
three
pounds
of
wool
they
had
got
a
little
tipsy
and
had
had
such
fun
with
the
old
fishwife
at
the
headland
who
had
used
a
for
a
sail
so
he
took
the
belt
away
with
him
and
said
nothing
about
it
it
was
no
good
giving
pain
to
no
purpose
thought
he
but
the
longer
the
winter
lasted
the
more
he
bothered
himself
with
odd
notions
about
what
the
parson
had
said
and
he
knew
not
what
he
should
do
in
case
he
came
upon
something
else
such
as
another
boot
or
something
that
a
squid
or
a
fish
or
a
crab
or
a
greenland
shark
might
have
bitten
off
he
began
to
be
really
afraid
of
rowing
out
in
the
sea
there
among
the
skerries
and
yet
for
all
that
it
was
as
though
he
were
constantly
being
drawn
thither
by
the
hope
of
finding
perhaps
so
much
of
the
remains
as
might
show
the
parson
where
the
soul
had
been
and
so
move
him
to
give
them
a
christian
burial
he
took
to
walking
about
all
by
himself
in
a
brown
study
and
then
too
he
had
such
nasty
dreams
his
door
flew
open
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
let
in
a
cold
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
brother
were
limping
about
the
room
and
yelling
that
he
must
have
his
foot
again
the
draugs
were
pulling
and
twisting
him
about
so
for
hours
and
hours
he
stood
over
his
work
without
laying
a
hand
to
it
and
blankly
staring
at
the
fifth
wall
at
last
he
felt
as
if
he
were
really
going
out
of
his
wits
because
of
the
great
responsibility
he
had
taken
upon
himself
by
burying
the
foot
in
the
churchyard
he
did
want
to
pitch
it
into
the
sea
again
but
it
could
lie
in
the
churchyard
either
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
so
clearly
that
his
brother
could
not
be
among
the
blessed
and
he
kept
going
about
and
thinking
of
all
that
might
be
lying
and
drifting
and
floating
about
among
the
skerries
so
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
dredge
there
and
lay
out
by
the
with
ropes
and
dredging
gear
but
all
that
he
dredged
up
was
and
weeds
and
and
like
rubbish
one
evening
as
he
sat
out
there
by
the
rocks
trying
his
luck
at
fishing
and
the
line
with
the
stone
and
all
the
hooks
upon
it
shot
down
over
the
boat
side
the
last
of
the
hooks
caught
in
one
of
his
eyes
and
right
to
the
bottom
went
the
eye
there
was
no
use
dredging
for
and
he
could
see
to
row
home
very
well
without
it
in
the
night
he
lay
with
a
bandage
over
his
eye
wakeful
for
pain
and
he
thought
and
thought
till
things
looked
as
black
as
they
could
be
to
him
was
there
ever
any
one
in
the
world
in
such
a
hobble
as
he
all
at
once
such
an
odd
thing
happened
he
thought
he
was
looking
about
him
deep
down
in
the
sea
and
he
saw
the
fishes
flitting
and
snapping
about
among
the
and
seaweeds
round
about
the
fishing
line
they
bit
at
the
bait
and
wriggled
and
tried
to
slip
off
first
a
cod
and
then
a
ling
and
then
a
last
of
all
a
haddock
came
and
stood
still
there
and
chewed
the
water
a
little
as
if
it
were
tasting
before
swallowing
it
and
he
saw
there
what
he
could
take
his
eyes
off
it
looked
like
the
back
of
a
man
in
leather
clothes
with
one
sleeve
caught
beneath
the
grapnel
of
a
then
a
heavy
white
halibut
came
up
and
gulped
down
the
hook
and
it
became
pitch
dark
you
must
let
the
big
halibut
slip
off
again
when
you
pull
up
something
said
the
hook
tears
my
mouth
so
is
of
no
use
searching
except
in
the
evening
when
the
tide
in
the
sound
is
on
the
ebb
next
day
he
went
off
and
took
a
piece
of
a
tombstone
from
the
churchyard
to
dredge
the
bottom
with
and
in
the
evening
when
the
tide
had
turned
he
lay
out
in
the
sound
again
and
searched
immediately
he
hauled
up
the
grapnel
of
a
the
hooks
of
which
were
clinging
to
a
leather
fisherman
jacket
with
the
remains
of
an
arm
in
it
the
fishes
had
got
as
much
as
they
could
of
it
out
of
the
leather
jacket
off
to
the
parson
he
rowed
straightway
what
read
the
service
over
a
old
leather
jacket
cried
the
parson
of
brönö
i
throw
the
into
the
bargain
answered
isaac
waifs
and
strays
and
sea
salvage
should
be
advertised
in
the
church
porch
thundered
the
parson
then
isaac
looked
straight
into
the
parson
face
the
has
been
heavy
enough
on
my
conscience
said
he
and
sure
i
do
want
to
be
saddled
with
the
leather
jacket
as
well
i
tell
you
i
do
mean
to
cast
consecrated
earth
to
the
winds
said
the
parson
he
was
getting
wroth
isaac
scratched
his
head
again
na
na
said
he
and
with
that
he
had
to
be
content
and
go
home
but
isaac
had
neither
rest
nor
repose
there
lay
such
a
grievous
load
upon
him
in
the
night
time
he
again
saw
the
big
white
halibut
it
was
going
round
and
round
so
slowly
and
sadly
in
the
selfsame
circle
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
was
just
as
if
some
invisible
sort
of
netting
was
all
round
it
and
the
whole
time
it
was
striving
to
slip
through
the
meshes
isaac
lay
there
and
gazed
and
gazed
till
his
blind
eye
ached
again
no
sooner
was
he
out
dredging
next
day
and
had
let
down
the
ropes
than
an
ugly
heavy
squid
came
up
and
spouted
up
a
black
jet
right
in
front
of
him
but
one
evening
he
let
the
boat
drive
as
the
current
chose
to
take
it
outside
the
skerries
but
within
the
islands
at
last
it
stopped
at
a
certain
spot
as
if
it
were
moored
fast
and
there
it
grew
wondrously
still
there
was
not
a
bird
in
the
air
or
a
sign
of
life
in
the
sea
all
at
once
up
came
a
big
bubble
right
in
front
of
the
jib
and
as
it
burst
he
heard
a
deep
heavy
sigh
but
isaac
had
his
own
opinion
about
what
he
had
seen
and
the
parson
of
brönö
shall
see
to
the
funeral
too
or
i
know
the
reason
why
said
he
from
henceforth
it
was
bruited
abroad
that
he
had
second
sight
and
saw
many
things
about
him
which
were
hid
from
other
folks
he
could
tell
exactly
where
the
fish
were
to
be
found
thick
together
by
the
and
where
they
were
not
and
whenever
they
asked
him
about
such
things
he
would
say
if
i
do
know
it
my
brother
does
now
one
day
it
chanced
that
the
parson
of
brönö
had
to
go
out
along
the
coast
on
a
pious
errand
and
isaac
was
one
of
them
who
had
to
row
him
thither
off
they
went
with
a
rattling
good
breeze
the
parson
got
quickly
there
and
was
not
very
long
about
his
business
for
next
day
he
had
to
hold
divine
service
in
his
own
parish
church
the
firth
seems
to
me
a
bit
roughish
said
he
and
is
getting
towards
evening
but
as
we
have
come
hither
i
should
think
we
could
get
back
again
also
they
had
not
got
very
far
on
their
homeward
journey
when
the
rising
gale
began
to
whistle
and
whine
so
that
they
had
to
take
in
four
clews
and
away
they
went
with
the
and
the
flying
about
their
ears
while
the
waxing
rollers
rose
big
as
houses
the
parson
of
brönö
had
never
been
out
in
such
weather
before
they
sailed
right
into
the
rollers
and
they
sailed
out
again
soon
it
became
black
night
the
sea
shone
like
mountain
and
the
showers
of
snow
and
spray
rather
waxed
than
waned
isaac
had
just
taken
in
the
fifth
clew
also
when
one
of
the
planks
amidships
gave
way
so
that
the
sea
foamed
in
and
the
parson
of
brönö
and
the
crew
leaped
upon
the
upper
deck
and
bawled
out
that
the
boat
was
going
down
i
do
think
she
founder
this
voyage
said
isaac
and
he
remained
sitting
where
he
was
at
the
rudder
but
as
the
moon
peeped
forth
from
behind
a
they
saw
that
a
strange
foremastman
was
standing
in
the
scuppers
and
baling
the
water
out
of
the
boat
as
fast
as
it
poured
in
i
did
know
that
i
had
hired
that
fellow
yonder
said
the
parson
of
brönö
he
seems
to
me
to
be
baling
with
a
and
it
also
seems
to
me
as
if
he
had
neither
breeches
nor
skin
upon
his
legs
and
the
upper
part
of
him
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
empty
fluttering
leather
jacket
parson
has
seen
him
before
i
think
said
isaac
then
the
parson
of
brönö
grew
angry
by
virtue
of
my
sacred
office
said
he
i
adjure
him
to
depart
from
amidships
na
na
answered
isaac
and
can
parson
also
answer
for
the
plank
that
has
burst
then
the
parson
bethought
him
of
the
evil
case
he
was
in
the
man
seems
to
me
mortally
strong
and
we
have
great
need
of
him
said
he
nor
is
it
any
great
sin
methinks
to
help
a
servant
of
over
the
sea
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
he
wants
in
return
the
billows
burst
and
the
blast
howled
around
him
only
some
two
or
three
shovels
of
earth
on
a
rotten
and
a
mouldy
said
isaac
if
you
able
to
gad
about
again
here
below
i
suppose
there
nothing
against
your
being
able
to
enter
into
bliss
again
for
all
that
i
know
bawled
the
parson
of
brönö
and
you
shall
have
your
shovelfuls
of
earth
into
the
bargain
just
as
he
said
this
the
water
within
the
skerries
all
at
once
became
quite
smooth
and
the
parson
boat
drove
high
and
dry
upon
the
sandbank
so
that
the
mast
cracked
at
nothing
a
house
having
usually
only
four
walls
see
the
fisherman
and
the
draug
see
the
fisherman
and
the
draug
illustration
the
there
was
once
a
skipper
of
dyrevig
called
bardun
he
was
so
headstrong
that
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
him
whatever
he
set
his
mind
upon
that
should
be
done
he
said
and
done
it
always
was
if
he
promised
to
be
at
a
dance
the
girls
could
safely
rely
upon
his
being
there
though
it
blew
a
tempest
and
rained
cats
and
dogs
he
would
come
scudding
along
on
a
to
his
father
house
through
storm
and
stress
row
upon
row
of
girls
would
be
waiting
for
him
there
and
he
spanked
the
floor
with
every
one
of
them
in
turn
and
left
their
gallants
to
cool
their
heels
as
best
they
might
he
always
must
be
he
would
go
too
and
would
venture
with
his
fishing
gaff
into
seas
where
only
large
vessels
were
wont
to
go
if
there
was
anything
nobody
else
dared
do
bardun
was
the
man
to
do
it
and
absurd
and
desperate
as
the
venture
might
be
he
always
succeeded
so
that
folks
were
always
talking
about
him
now
right
out
at
sea
beyond
the
skerries
lay
a
large
rock
the
lair
of
whither
the
merchant
who
owned
it
came
every
year
to
bring
away
rich
loads
of
a
long
way
down
the
side
of
this
lofty
rock
was
a
cleft
nobody
could
tell
how
far
the
rock
it
went
and
so
inaccessible
was
it
there
that
its
owner
had
said
that
whoever
liked
might
come
and
take
from
thence
it
became
quite
a
proverb
to
say
when
anything
could
be
done
that
it
was
just
as
impossible
as
taking
from
dyrevig
rock
but
bardun
passed
by
the
rock
and
peeped
up
at
the
cleft
and
saw
all
the
hosts
of
the
fowls
of
the
air
lighting
upon
it
so
many
times
that
he
felt
he
needs
must
try
his
hand
at
it
he
lost
no
time
about
it
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
as
he
set
out
he
took
with
him
a
long
piece
of
rope
which
he
cast
two
or
three
times
round
a
rocky
crag
and
lowered
himself
down
till
he
was
right
opposite
the
cleft
there
he
hung
and
swung
over
it
backwards
and
forwards
till
he
had
got
a
firm
footing
and
then
he
set
about
collecting
and
stuffing
his
sacks
with
it
he
went
searching
about
for
it
so
far
into
the
rocky
chasm
that
he
saw
no
more
than
a
gleam
of
sunlight
outside
the
opening
and
he
take
a
hundreth
part
of
the
that
was
there
it
was
quite
late
in
the
evening
before
he
gave
up
trying
to
gather
it
all
but
when
he
came
out
again
the
stone
which
he
had
placed
on
the
top
of
the
rope
and
tied
it
to
was
gone
and
now
the
rope
hung
loosely
there
and
dangled
over
the
side
of
the
rock
the
wind
blew
it
in
and
out
and
hither
and
thither
the
currents
of
air
sported
madly
with
it
so
that
it
always
kept
sheer
away
from
the
rock
and
far
out
over
the
abyss
there
he
stood
then
and
tried
again
and
again
to
clutch
hold
of
it
till
the
sun
lay
right
down
in
the
sea
when
it
began
to
dawn
again
and
the
morning
breeze
rose
up
from
the
sea
he
all
at
once
heard
something
right
over
his
head
say
it
blows
away
it
blows
away
he
looked
up
and
there
he
saw
a
big
woman
holding
the
rope
away
from
the
cliff
side
every
time
he
made
a
grip
at
it
she
wrenched
and
twisted
it
right
away
over
the
rocky
wall
and
there
was
a
laughing
and
a
grinning
all
down
the
mountain
side
it
blows
away
it
blows
away
and
again
and
again
the
rope
drove
in
and
out
and
hither
and
thither
you
had
better
take
a
spring
at
once
and
not
wait
till
you
tired
thought
he
it
was
a
pretty
long
leap
to
take
but
he
went
back
a
sufficient
distance
and
then
out
he
sprang
bardun
was
not
the
man
to
fall
short
of
anything
he
caught
the
rope
and
held
it
tight
and
oddly
enough
it
seemed
now
to
run
up
the
of
its
own
accord
just
as
if
some
one
were
hoisting
it
but
in
front
of
the
rocky
crag
to
which
he
had
fastened
the
rope
he
heard
a
soughing
and
a
sighing
and
something
said
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
and
now
thou
hast
dominion
over
me
when
the
blast
blows
and
whines
about
thee
is
i
who
long
for
thee
and
here
thou
hast
a
rudder
which
will
give
thee
luck
and
a
fair
wind
whithersoever
thou
farest
he
who
is
with
thee
shall
thrive
and
he
who
is
against
thee
shall
suffer
shipwreck
and
be
lost
for
is
i
who
am
in
the
windy
gusts
then
all
at
once
everything
was
quite
still
but
down
on
the
sea
below
there
swept
a
heavy
squall
there
stood
bardun
with
the
rudder
in
his
hand
and
he
understood
that
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
lightly
cast
away
homeward
he
steered
with
a
racing
breeze
behind
him
and
he
had
not
sailed
far
before
he
met
a
galeas
which
gave
him
the
bergen
price
for
his
but
bardun
was
not
content
with
only
going
thither
once
he
went
just
the
same
as
before
and
he
returned
from
the
dyrevig
rock
with
a
pile
of
sacks
of
on
his
boat
right
up
to
the
mast
he
bought
houses
and
ships
mightier
and
mightier
he
grew
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
owned
whole
both
northwards
and
southwards
those
who
submitted
to
him
and
did
as
he
would
have
them
do
increased
and
prospered
and
saw
good
days
but
all
who
stood
in
his
way
were
wrecked
on
the
sea
and
perished
for
the
was
on
his
side
so
things
quickly
went
from
good
to
better
with
him
what
was
to
him
a
fair
wind
was
the
ruin
of
all
those
who
were
in
any
way
opposed
to
him
at
last
he
became
so
rich
and
mighty
that
he
owned
every
blessed
and
in
all
finmark
and
sent
vessels
even
as
far
as
spitzbergen
nobody
durst
sell
fish
up
north
without
his
leave
and
his
sloops
sailed
over
to
bergen
eighteen
at
a
time
he
ruled
and
gave
judgment
as
it
seemed
best
to
him
but
the
magistrates
thought
that
such
authority
was
too
much
for
one
man
to
have
and
they
began
to
make
inquiries
and
receive
complaints
of
how
he
domineered
the
people
next
the
magistrates
sent
him
a
warning
but
the
right
to
rule
lies
in
my
rudder
thought
bardun
to
himself
then
the
magistrates
summoned
him
before
the
tribunal
bardun
simply
whistled
contemptuously
at
last
matters
came
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
magistrates
sailed
forth
to
seize
him
in
the
midst
of
a
howling
tempest
and
down
they
went
in
the
finmark
seas
then
bardun
was
made
chief
magistrate
till
such
time
as
the
king
should
send
up
another
but
the
new
man
who
came
had
not
been
very
long
in
office
there
before
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
was
not
he
but
bardun
who
held
sway
so
the
same
thing
happened
over
again
bardun
was
summoned
in
vain
before
the
courts
and
the
magistrates
came
forth
to
seize
him
and
perished
at
sea
but
when
the
next
governor
was
sent
up
to
finmark
it
was
only
the
keel
of
the
king
ship
that
came
drifting
in
from
the
sea
at
last
nobody
would
venture
thither
to
certain
ruin
and
bardun
was
left
alone
and
ruled
over
all
then
so
mighty
was
he
in
all
finmark
that
he
reigned
there
like
the
king
himself
now
he
had
but
one
child
and
that
a
daughter
boel
was
her
name
and
she
shot
up
so
handsome
and
comely
that
her
beauty
shone
like
the
sun
no
bridegroom
was
good
enough
for
her
unless
perhaps
it
were
the
king
son
wooers
came
from
afar
and
came
in
vain
she
was
to
have
a
dower
they
said
such
as
no
girl
in
the
north
had
ever
had
before
one
year
quite
a
young
officer
came
up
thither
with
a
letter
from
the
king
his
garments
were
stiff
with
gold
and
shone
and
sparkled
wherever
he
went
bardun
received
him
well
and
helped
him
to
carry
out
the
king
commands
but
since
the
day
when
he
himself
was
young
and
got
the
answer
yes
from
his
bride
he
had
never
been
so
happy
as
when
boel
came
to
him
one
day
and
said
that
the
young
officer
had
wooed
her
and
she
would
throw
herself
into
the
sea
straightway
if
she
could
have
him
in
this
way
he
argued
his
race
would
always
sit
in
the
seat
of
authority
and
hold
sway
when
he
was
gone
while
the
officer
in
the
course
of
the
summer
was
out
on
circuit
bardun
set
a
hundred
men
to
work
to
build
a
house
for
them
it
was
to
shine
like
a
castle
and
be
bright
with
high
halls
and
large
and
windows
in
long
rooms
and
furs
and
cloth
of
gold
and
bright
tiles
were
fetched
from
the
far
south
and
in
the
autumn
there
was
such
a
wedding
that
the
whole
land
heard
and
talked
about
it
but
it
was
not
long
before
bardun
began
to
find
that
to
be
a
fact
which
was
already
a
rumour
to
wit
that
the
man
who
had
got
his
daughter
would
fain
have
his
own
way
also
he
laid
down
the
law
and
gave
judgment
like
bardun
himself
and
he
bardun
not
once
nor
twice
then
bardun
went
to
boel
and
bade
her
take
her
husband
to
task
and
look
sharp
about
it
he
had
never
yet
seen
the
man
said
he
who
could
be
set
right
by
his
bride
in
the
days
when
they
did
nothing
but
eat
honey
together
but
boel
said
that
she
had
wedded
a
man
who
to
her
mind
was
no
less
a
man
than
her
own
father
and
it
was
his
office
besides
to
uphold
the
law
and
jurisdiction
of
the
king
young
folks
are
easy
to
talk
over
thought
bardun
one
can
do
anything
with
them
when
one
only
makes
them
fancy
they
are
having
their
own
way
and
it
is
wonderful
how
far
one
can
get
if
one
only
bides
one
time
and
makes
the
best
of
things
whatever
was
out
of
gear
he
could
very
easily
put
right
again
when
once
he
got
a
firm
grip
of
the
reins
so
he
praised
everything
his
did
and
talked
big
about
him
so
that
there
was
really
no
end
to
it
he
was
glad
he
said
that
such
a
wise
and
stately
ruler
was
there
ready
to
stand
in
his
shoes
against
the
day
when
he
should
grow
old
and
so
he
made
himself
small
and
his
voice
quivered
when
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
really
a
sick
and
man
but
it
did
escape
boel
how
he
slammed
to
the
doors
and
struck
the
stones
with
his
stick
till
the
sparks
flew
next
time
the
court
met
bardun
was
taxed
to
a
full
tenth
of
the
value
of
all
his
property
according
to
the
king
law
and
justice
then
only
did
he
begin
to
foresee
that
it
might
fare
with
the
magistrates
now
as
it
had
done
formerly
but
all
women
like
pomp
and
show
thought
he
and
boel
was
in
this
respect
no
different
to
other
people
and
she
was
no
daughter
of
his
either
if
she
could
keep
the
upper
hand
of
her
husband
so
he
bought
her
gold
and
jewels
and
other
costly
things
one
day
he
came
with
a
bracelet
and
another
day
with
a
chain
and
now
it
was
a
belt
and
now
a
gold
embroidered
shoe
and
every
time
he
told
her
that
he
brought
her
these
gifts
because
she
was
his
dearest
jewel
he
knew
of
nothing
in
the
world
that
was
too
precious
for
her
then
in
his
most
pleasant
most
courtly
style
he
just
hinted
that
she
might
see
to
it
and
talk
her
husband
over
to
other
ways
but
it
booted
him
even
less
than
before
and
so
things
went
on
till
autumn
the
king
law
was
first
and
his
will
was
only
second
then
he
began
to
dread
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
his
eyes
sparkled
so
fiercely
that
none
dare
come
near
him
but
at
night
he
would
pace
up
and
down
and
shriek
and
bellow
at
his
daughter
and
give
her
all
sorts
of
vile
names
now
one
day
he
came
in
to
boel
with
a
heavy
gold
crown
full
of
the
most
precious
stones
she
should
be
the
queen
of
finmark
and
spitzbergen
said
he
if
her
husband
would
do
according
to
his
will
then
she
looked
him
stiffly
in
the
face
and
said
she
would
never
seduce
her
husband
into
breaking
the
king
law
he
grew
as
pale
as
the
wall
behind
him
and
cast
the
gold
crown
on
the
floor
so
that
there
was
a
perfect
shower
of
precious
stones
about
them
she
must
know
said
he
that
her
father
and
none
other
was
king
here
and
now
the
young
officer
should
find
out
how
it
fared
with
them
who
sat
in
his
seat
then
boel
washed
her
hands
of
her
father
altogether
but
she
advised
her
husband
to
depart
forthwith
and
on
the
third
day
she
had
packed
up
all
her
bridal
finery
and
departed
in
the
vessel
with
the
young
officer
then
bardun
smote
his
head
against
the
wall
and
that
night
he
laughed
so
that
it
was
heard
far
away
but
he
wept
for
his
daughter
and
now
there
arose
such
a
storm
that
the
sea
was
white
for
a
whole
week
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
tidings
came
that
the
ship
that
boel
and
her
husband
had
sailed
by
had
gone
down
and
the
splinters
lay
and
floated
among
the
skerries
then
bardun
took
the
rudder
he
had
got
from
the
and
stuck
it
into
the
stern
of
the
largest
yacht
he
had
he
was
god
himself
now
said
he
and
could
always
get
a
fair
wind
to
steer
by
and
could
rule
where
he
would
in
the
wide
world
and
southwards
he
sailed
with
a
rattling
breeze
and
the
billows
rolled
after
him
like
mounds
and
hillocks
heavier
and
heavier
grew
the
sea
till
it
rolled
like
white
mountains
as
high
as
the
rocky
walls
of
lofoten
it
could
well
be
less
when
he
was
to
rule
the
whole
world
cried
he
and
so
he
set
his
rudder
dead
southwards
he
never
diminished
his
sail
one
bit
and
worse
and
worse
grew
the
storm
and
higher
and
higher
rose
the
sea
for
now
he
was
steering
right
into
the
sun
a
small
boat
illustration
the
huldrefish
it
was
such
an
odd
trout
that
nona
hauled
in
at
the
end
of
his
large
and
fat
red
spotted
and
shiny
it
sprawled
and
squirmed
with
its
dirty
yellow
belly
above
the
water
to
wriggle
off
the
hook
and
when
he
got
it
into
the
boat
and
took
it
off
the
hook
he
saw
that
it
had
only
two
small
slits
where
the
eyes
should
have
been
it
must
be
a
huldrefish
thought
one
of
the
boatmen
for
rumour
had
it
that
that
lake
was
one
of
those
which
had
a
double
bottom
but
nona
did
trouble
his
head
very
much
about
what
sort
of
a
fish
it
was
so
long
as
it
was
a
big
one
he
was
ravenously
hungry
and
bawled
to
them
to
row
as
rapidly
as
possible
ashore
so
as
to
get
it
cooked
he
had
been
sitting
the
whole
afternoon
with
empty
lines
out
in
the
mountain
lake
there
but
as
for
the
trout
it
was
only
an
hour
ago
since
it
had
been
steering
its
way
through
the
water
with
its
rudder
of
a
tail
and
allowed
itself
to
be
fooled
by
a
hook
and
already
it
lay
cooked
red
there
on
the
dish
but
now
nona
recollected
about
the
strange
eyes
and
felt
for
them
and
pricked
away
at
its
head
with
his
fork
there
was
nothing
but
slits
outside
and
yet
there
was
a
sort
of
hard
eyeball
inside
the
head
was
strangely
shaped
and
looked
very
peculiar
in
many
respects
he
was
vexed
that
he
had
not
examined
it
more
closely
before
it
was
cooked
it
was
not
so
easy
now
to
make
out
what
it
really
was
it
had
tasted
however
and
that
was
something
but
at
night
there
was
as
it
were
a
gleam
of
bright
water
before
his
eyes
and
he
lay
half
asleep
thinking
of
the
odd
fish
he
had
pulled
up
he
was
in
his
boat
again
he
thought
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
hands
felt
the
fish
wriggling
and
sprawling
for
its
life
and
shooting
its
snout
backwards
and
forwards
to
get
off
the
hook
all
at
once
it
grew
so
heavy
and
strong
that
it
drew
the
boat
after
it
by
the
line
it
went
along
at
a
frightful
speed
while
the
lake
gradually
diminished
as
it
were
and
dried
up
there
was
an
irresistible
sucking
of
the
water
in
the
direction
the
fish
went
which
was
towards
a
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
like
a
funnel
and
right
into
this
hole
went
the
boat
it
glided
for
a
long
time
in
a
sort
of
twilight
along
a
subterranean
river
which
dashed
and
splashed
about
him
the
air
that
met
him
was
at
first
chilly
and
gradually
however
it
grew
milder
and
milder
and
warmer
and
warmer
the
stream
now
flowed
along
calmly
and
quietly
and
broadened
out
continually
till
it
fell
into
a
large
lake
beyond
the
borders
of
this
lake
but
only
half
visible
in
the
gloom
stretched
swamps
and
morasses
where
he
heard
sounds
as
of
huge
beasts
wading
and
trampling
serpent
like
they
rose
and
writhed
with
a
crashing
and
splashing
and
snorting
amidst
the
tepid
mud
and
mire
by
the
phosphorescent
gleams
he
saw
various
fishes
close
to
his
boat
but
all
of
them
lacked
eyes
and
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
outlines
of
gigantic
stretching
far
away
into
the
darkness
he
now
understood
that
it
was
from
down
here
that
they
pop
up
their
heads
off
the
coast
in
the
dog
days
when
the
sea
is
warm
the
lindworm
with
its
flat
head
and
duck
beak
darted
after
fish
and
crept
up
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
through
the
slimy
ways
of
mire
and
marsh
through
the
warm
and
choking
gloom
there
came
from
time
to
time
a
cooling
chilling
blast
from
the
cold
curves
and
winds
of
the
slimy
and
slippery
greenish
lichworm
which
bores
its
way
through
the
earth
and
eats
away
the
coffins
that
are
rotting
in
the
churchyards
horrible
shapeless
monsters
with
streaming
manes
such
as
are
said
to
sometimes
appear
in
mountain
tarns
writhed
and
wallowed
and
seized
their
prey
in
the
fens
and
marshes
and
he
caught
glimpses
of
all
sorts
of
humanlike
creatures
such
as
fishermen
and
sailors
meet
and
marvel
at
on
the
sea
and
landsmen
see
outside
the
elfin
mounds
and
besides
that
there
was
a
soft
whizzing
and
an
endless
hovering
and
swarming
of
beings
whose
shapes
were
nevertheless
invisible
to
the
eye
of
man
then
the
boat
glided
into
miry
pulpy
water
where
her
course
tended
downwards
and
where
the
above
darkened
as
it
sank
lower
and
lower
all
at
once
a
blinding
strip
of
light
shot
down
from
a
bright
blue
slit
high
high
above
him
a
stuffy
vapour
stood
round
about
him
the
water
was
as
yellow
and
turbid
as
that
which
comes
out
of
steam
boilers
and
he
called
to
mind
the
peculiar
tepid
undrinkable
water
which
bubbles
up
by
the
side
of
artesian
wells
it
was
quite
hot
up
there
they
were
boring
down
to
a
world
of
warm
watercourses
and
liquid
strata
beneath
the
earth
crust
heat
as
from
an
oven
rose
up
from
the
huge
abysses
and
dizzying
clefts
whilst
mighty
steaming
waterfalls
roared
and
shook
the
ground
all
at
once
he
felt
as
if
his
body
were
breaking
loose
freeing
itself
and
rising
in
the
air
he
had
a
feeling
of
infinite
lightness
of
a
wondrous
capability
for
floating
in
higher
atmospheres
and
recovering
equilibrium
and
before
he
knew
how
it
was
he
found
himself
up
on
the
earth
again
a
name
for
anything
elfin
or
gnomish
compare
a
hiding
covering
it
implies
the
invisibility
of
the
elfin
race
serpent

eats
the
dead

we
have

we
may
have

illustration
finn
blood
in
svartfjord
north
of
senje
dwelt
a
lad
called
eilert
his
neighbours
were
seafaring
finns
and
among
their
children
was
a
pale
little
girl
remarkable
for
her
long
black
hair
and
her
large
eyes
they
dwelt
behind
the
crag
on
the
other
side
of
the
promontory
and
fished
for
a
livelihood
as
also
did
eilert
parents
wherefore
there
was
no
particular
goodwill
between
the
families
for
the
nearest
fishing
ground
was
but
a
small
one
and
each
would
have
liked
to
have
rowed
there
alone
nevertheless
though
his
parents
did
like
it
at
all
and
even
forbade
it
eilert
used
to
sneak
regularly
down
to
the
finns
there
they
had
always
strange
tales
to
tell
and
he
heard
wondrous
things
about
the
recesses
of
the
mountains
where
the
original
home
of
the
finns
was
and
where
in
the
olden
time
dwelt
the
finn
kings
who
were
masters
among
the
magicians
there
too
he
heard
tell
of
all
that
was
beneath
the
sea
where
the
mermen
and
the
draugs
hold
sway
the
latter
are
gloomy
evil
powers
and
many
a
time
his
blood
stood
still
in
his
veins
as
he
sat
and
listened
they
told
him
that
the
draug
usually
showed
himself
on
the
strand
in
the
moonlight
on
those
spots
which
were
covered
with
that
he
had
a
bunch
of
seaweed
instead
of
a
head
but
shaped
so
peculiarly
that
whoever
came
across
him
absolutely
could
help
gazing
into
his
pale
and
horrible
face
they
themselves
had
seen
him
many
a
time
and
once
they
had
driven
him
thwart
by
thwart
out
of
the
boat
where
he
had
sat
one
morning
and
turned
the
oars
upside
down
when
eilert
hastened
homewards
in
the
darkness
round
the
headland
along
the
strand
over
heaps
of
seaweed
he
dare
scarcely
look
around
him
and
many
a
time
the
sweat
absolutely
streamed
from
his
forehead
in
proportion
as
hostility
increased
among
the
old
people
they
had
a
good
deal
of
fault
to
find
with
one
another
and
eilert
heard
no
end
of
evil
things
spoken
about
the
finns
at
home
now
it
was
this
and
now
it
was
that
they
did
even
row
like
honest
folk
for
after
the
finnish
fashion
they
took
high
and
swift
strokes
as
if
they
were
womenkind
and
they
all
talked
together
and
made
a
noise
while
they
rowed
instead
of
being
silent
in
the
boat
but
what
impressed
eilert
most
of
all
was
the
fact
that
in
the
finnwoman
family
they
practised
sorcery
and
idolatry
or
so
folks
said
he
also
heard
tell
of
something
beyond
all
question
and
that
was
the
shame
of
having
finn
blood
in
one
veins
which
also
was
the
reason
why
the
finns
were
not
as
good
as
other
honest
folk
so
that
the
magistrates
gave
them
their
own
distinct
in
the
churchyard
and
their
own
separate
in
church
eilert
had
seen
this
with
his
own
eyes
in
the
church
at
berg
all
this
made
him
very
angry
for
he
could
not
help
liking
the
finn
folks
down
yonder
and
especially
little
zilla
they
two
were
always
together
she
knew
such
a
lot
about
the
merman
henceforth
his
conscience
always
plagued
him
when
he
played
with
her
and
whenever
she
stared
at
him
with
her
large
black
eyes
while
she
told
him
tales
he
used
to
begin
to
feel
a
little
bit
afraid
for
at
such
times
he
reflected
that
she
and
her
people
belonged
to
the
damned
and
that
was
why
they
knew
so
much
about
such
things
but
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
it
made
him
so
bitterly
angry
especially
on
her
account
she
too
was
frequently
taken
aback
by
his
odd
behaviour
towards
her
which
she
could
understand
at
all
and
then
as
was
her
wont
she
would
begin
laughing
at
and
teasing
him
by
making
him
run
after
her
while
she
went
and
hid
herself
one
day
he
found
her
sitting
on
a
boulder
by
the
she
had
in
her
lap
an
eider
duck
which
had
been
shot
and
could
only
have
died
quite
recently
for
it
was
still
warm
and
she
wept
bitterly
over
it
it
was
she
sobbed
the
same
bird
which
made
its
nest
every
year
beneath
the
shelter
of
their
outhouse
she
knew
it
quite
well
and
she
showed
him
a
feather
in
its
white
breast
it
had
been
struck
dead
by
a
single
shot
and
only
a
single
red
drop
had
come
out
of
it
it
had
tried
to
reach
its
nest
but
had
died
on
its
way
on
the
strand
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
dried
her
face
with
her
hair
in
impetuous
finnish
fashion
eilert
laughed
at
her
as
boys
will
but
he
overdid
it
and
was
very
pale
the
whole
time
he
dared
not
tell
her
that
that
very
day
he
had
taken
a
random
shot
with
his
father
gun
from
behind
the
headland
at
a
bird
a
long
way
off
which
was
swimming
ashore
one
autumn
eilert
father
was
downright
desperate
day
after
day
on
the
fishing
grounds
his
lines
caught
next
to
nothing
while
he
was
forced
to
look
on
and
see
the
finn
pull
up
one
rich
catch
after
another
he
was
sure
too
that
he
had
noticed
malicious
gestures
over
in
the
boat
after
that
his
whole
house
nourished
a
double
bitterness
against
them
and
when
they
talked
it
over
in
the
evening
it
was
agreed
as
a
thing
beyond
all
question
that
finnish
sorcery
had
something
to
do
with
it
against
this
there
was
only
one
remedy
and
that
was
to
rub
on
the
lines
but
one
must
beware
of
doing
so
lest
one
should
thereby
offend
the
dead
and
expose
oneself
to
their
vengeance
while
the
would
gain
power
over
one
at
the
same
time
eilert
bothered
his
head
a
good
deal
over
all
this
it
almost
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
had
a
share
in
the
deed
because
he
was
on
such
a
good
footing
with
the
finn
folks
on
the
following
sunday
both
he
and
the
finn
folks
were
at
berg
church
and
he
secretly
abstracted
a
handful
of
mould
from
one
of
the
finn
graves
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
same
evening
when
they
came
home
he
strewed
the
mould
over
his
father
lines
unobserved
and
oddly
enough
the
very
next
time
his
father
cast
his
lines
as
many
fish
were
caught
as
in
the
good
old
times
but
after
this
eilert
anxiety
became
indescribable
he
was
especially
cautions
while
they
were
working
of
an
evening
round
the
fireside
and
it
was
dark
in
the
distant
corners
of
the
room
he
sat
there
with
a
piece
of
steel
in
his
pocket
to
beg
forgiveness
of
the
dead
is
the
only
helpful
means
against
the
consequences
of
such
deeds
as
his
otherwise
one
will
be
dragged
off
at
night
by
an
invisible
hand
to
the
churchyard
though
one
were
lashed
fast
to
the
bed
by
a
ship
hawser
when
eilert
on
the
following
preaching
sunday
went
to
church
he
took
very
good
care
to
go
to
the
grave
and
beg
forgiveness
of
the
dead
as
eilert
grew
older
he
got
to
understand
that
the
finn
folks
must
after
all
be
pretty
much
the
same
sort
of
people
as
his
own
folks
at
home
but
on
the
other
hand
another
thought
was
now
uppermost
in
his
mind
the
thought
namely
that
the
finns
must
be
of
an
inferior
stock
with
a
taint
of
disgrace
about
them
nevertheless
he
could
not
very
well
do
without
zilla
society
and
they
were
very
much
together
as
before
especially
at
the
time
of
their
confirmation
but
when
eilert
became
a
man
and
mixed
more
with
the
people
of
the
parish
he
began
to
fancy
that
this
old
companionship
lowered
him
somewhat
in
the
eyes
of
his
neighbours
there
was
nobody
who
did
not
believe
as
a
matter
of
course
that
there
was
something
shameful
about
finn
blood
and
he
therefore
always
tried
to
avoid
her
in
company
the
girl
understood
it
all
well
enough
for
latterly
she
took
care
to
keep
out
of
his
way
nevertheless
one
day
she
came
as
had
been
her
wont
from
childhood
down
to
their
house
and
begged
for
leave
to
go
in
their
boat
when
they
rowed
to
church
next
day
there
were
lots
of
strangers
present
from
the
village
and
so
eilert
lest
folks
should
think
that
he
and
she
were
engaged
answered
mockingly
so
that
every
one
could
hear
him
that
was
perhaps
a
very
good
thing
for
finnish
sorcery
but
she
must
find
some
one
else
to
ferry
her
across
after
that
she
never
spoke
to
him
at
all
but
eilert
was
anything
but
happy
in
consequence
now
it
happened
one
winter
that
eilert
was
out
all
alone
fishing
for
greenland
shark
a
shark
suddenly
bit
the
boat
was
small
and
the
fish
was
very
big
but
eilert
would
not
give
in
and
the
end
of
the
business
was
that
his
boat
capsized
all
night
long
he
lay
on
the
top
of
it
in
the
mist
and
a
cruel
sea
as
now
he
sat
there
almost
fainting
for
drowsiness
and
dimly
conscious
that
the
end
was
not
far
off
and
the
sooner
it
came
the
better
he
suddenly
saw
a
man
in
seaman
clothes
sitting
astride
the
other
end
of
the
boat
bottom
and
glaring
savagely
at
him
with
a
pair
of
dull
reddish
eyes
he
was
so
heavy
that
the
boat
bottom
began
to
slowly
sink
down
at
end
where
he
sat
then
he
suddenly
vanished
but
it
seemed
to
eilert
as
if
the
lifted
a
bit
the
sea
had
all
at
once
grown
quite
calm
at
least
there
was
now
only
a
gentle
swell
and
right
in
front
of
him
lay
a
little
low
grey
island
towards
which
the
boat
was
slowly
drifting
the
skerry
was
wet
as
if
the
sea
had
only
recently
been
flowing
over
it
and
on
it
he
saw
a
pale
girl
with
such
lovely
eyes
she
wore
a
green
kirtle
and
round
her
body
a
broad
silver
girdle
with
figures
upon
it
such
as
the
finns
use
her
bodice
was
of
skin
and
beneath
her
which
seemed
to
be
of
green
was
a
chemise
like
the
feathery
breast
of
a
when
the
boat
came
drifting
on
to
the
island
she
came
down
to
him
and
said
as
if
she
knew
him
quite
well
so
you
come
at
last
eilert
i
been
waiting
for
you
so
long
it
seemed
to
eilert
as
if
an
icy
cold
shudder
ran
through
his
body
when
he
took
the
hand
which
helped
him
ashore
but
it
was
only
for
the
moment
and
he
forgot
it
instantly
in
the
midst
of
the
island
there
was
an
opening
with
a
brazen
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
splendid
cabin
whilst
he
stood
there
thinking
things
over
a
bit
he
saw
two
heavy
swimming
close
by
they
were
at
least
twelve
to
fourteen
ells
long
as
they
descended
the
sank
down
too
each
on
one
side
of
the
brazen
steps
oddly
enough
it
looked
as
if
the
island
was
transparent
when
the
girl
perceived
that
he
was
frightened
she
told
him
that
they
were
only
two
of
her
father
bodyguard
and
shortly
afterwards
they
disappeared
she
then
said
that
she
wanted
to
take
him
to
her
father
who
was
waiting
for
them
she
added
that
if
he
did
find
the
old
gentleman
precisely
as
handsome
as
he
might
expect
he
had
nevertheless
no
need
to
be
frightened
nor
was
he
to
be
astonished
too
much
at
what
he
saw
he
now
perceived
that
he
was
under
water
but
for
all
that
there
was
no
sign
of
moisture
he
was
on
a
white
sandy
bottom
covered
with
red
blue
and
shells
he
saw
meadows
of
mountains
thick
with
woods
of
bushy
seaweed
and
and
the
fishes
darted
about
on
every
side
just
as
the
birds
swarm
about
the
rocks
that
haunt
as
they
two
were
thus
walking
along
together
she
explained
many
things
to
him
high
up
he
saw
something
which
looked
like
a
black
cloud
with
a
white
lining
and
beneath
it
moved
backwards
and
forwards
a
shape
resembling
one
of
the
what
you
see
there
is
a
vessel
said
she
there
nasty
weather
up
there
now
and
beneath
the
boat
goes
he
who
was
sitting
along
with
you
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
just
now
if
it
is
wrecked
it
will
belong
to
us
and
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
speak
to
father
as
she
said
this
there
was
a
wild
rapacious
gleam
in
her
eyes
but
it
was
gone
again
immediately
and
in
point
of
fact
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
her
eyes
as
a
rule
they
were
unfathomably
dark
with
the
lustre
of
a
through
which
the
sparkles
but
occasionally
when
she
laughed
they
took
a
bright
glitter
as
when
the
sun
shines
deep
down
into
the
sea
now
and
again
they
passed
by
a
boat
or
a
vessel
half
buried
in
the
sand
out
and
in
of
the
cabin
doors
and
windows
of
which
fishes
swam
to
and
fro
close
by
the
wrecks
wandered
human
shapes
which
seemed
to
consist
of
nothing
but
blue
smoke
his
conductress
explained
to
him
that
these
were
the
spirits
of
drowned
men
who
had
not
had
christian
burial
one
must
beware
of
them
for
dead
ones
of
this
sort
are
malignant
they
always
know
when
one
of
their
own
race
is
about
to
be
wrecked
and
at
such
times
they
howl
the
of
the
draug
through
the
wintry
nights
then
they
went
further
on
their
way
right
across
a
deep
dark
valley
in
the
rocky
walls
above
him
he
saw
a
row
of
white
doors
from
which
a
sort
of
glimmer
as
from
the
northern
lights
shot
downwards
through
the
darkness
this
valley
stretched
in
a
direction
right
under
finmark
she
said
and
inside
the
white
doors
dwelt
the
old
finn
kings
who
had
perished
on
the
sea
then
she
went
and
opened
the
nearest
of
these
doors
here
down
in
the
salt
ocean
was
the
last
of
the
kings
who
had
capsized
in
the
very
breeze
that
he
himself
had
conjured
forth
but
could
not
afterwards
quell
there
on
a
block
of
stone
sat
a
wrinkled
yellow
finn
with
running
eyes
and
a
polished
crown
his
large
head
rocked
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
withered
neck
as
if
it
were
in
the
swirl
of
an
ocean
current
beside
him
on
the
same
block
sat
a
still
more
shrivelled
and
yellow
little
woman
who
also
had
a
crown
on
and
her
garments
were
covered
with
all
sorts
of
coloured
stones
she
was
stirring
up
a
brew
with
a
stick
if
she
only
had
fire
beneath
it
the
girl
told
eilert
she
and
her
husband
would
very
soon
have
dominion
again
over
the
salt
sea
for
the
thing
she
was
stirring
about
was
magic
stuff
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
which
opened
right
before
them
at
a
turn
of
the
road
stood
a
few
houses
together
like
a
little
town
and
a
little
further
on
eilert
saw
a
church
turned
upside
down
looking
with
its
long
pointed
tower
as
if
it
were
mirrored
in
the
water
the
girl
explained
to
him
that
her
father
dwelt
in
these
houses
and
the
church
was
one
of
the
seven
that
stood
in
his
realm
which
extended
all
over
helgoland
and
finmark
no
service
was
held
in
them
yet
but
it
would
be
held
when
the
drowned
bishop
who
sat
outside
in
a
brown
study
could
only
hit
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
that
was
to
be
served
and
then
all
the
draugs
would
go
to
church
the
bishop
she
said
had
been
sitting
and
pondering
the
matter
over
these
eight
hundred
years
so
he
would
no
doubt
very
soon
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
a
hundred
years
ago
the
bishop
had
advised
them
to
send
up
one
of
the
draugs
to
rödö
church
to
find
out
all
about
it
but
every
time
the
word
he
wanted
was
mentioned
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
it
in
the
mountain
kunnan
king
olaf
had
hung
a
of
pure
gold
and
it
is
guarded
by
the
first
priest
who
ever
came
to
nordland
who
stands
there
in
a
white
chasuble
on
the
day
the
priest
rings
the
bell
kunnan
will
become
a
big
stone
church
to
which
all
nordland
both
above
and
below
the
sea
will
resort
but
time
flies
and
therefore
all
who
come
down
here
below
are
asked
by
the
bishop
if
they
can
tell
him
that
name
at
this
eilert
felt
very
queer
indeed
and
he
felt
queerer
still
when
he
began
reflecting
and
found
to
his
horror
that
he
also
had
forgotten
that
name
while
he
stood
there
in
thought
the
girl
looked
at
him
so
anxiously
it
was
almost
as
if
she
wanted
to
help
him
to
find
it
and
could
and
with
that
she
all
at
once
grew
deadly
pale
the
draug
house
to
which
they
now
came
was
built
of
boat
keels
and
large
pieces
of
wreckage
in
the
interstices
of
which
grew
all
sorts
of
and
slimy
green
stuff
three
monstrously
heavy
green
posts
covered
with
formed
the
entrance
and
the
door
consisted
of
planks
which
had
sunk
to
the
bottom
and
were
full
of
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
knocker
was
a
heavy
rusty
iron
with
the
stump
of
a
ship
hawser
hanging
to
it
when
they
came
up
to
it
a
large
black
arm
stretched
out
and
opened
the
door
they
were
now
in
a
vaulted
chamber
with
fine
on
the
floor
in
the
corners
lay
all
sorts
of
ropes
yarn
and
and
among
them
casks
and
barrels
and
various
ship
inventories
on
a
heap
of
yarn
covered
by
an
old
sail
eilert
saw
the
draug
a
strongly
built
fellow
with
a
glazed
hat
shoved
back
on
to
the
top
of
his
head
with
tangled
hair
and
beard
small
tearful
eyes
and
a
broad
mouth
round
which
there
lay
for
the
moment
a
seaman
grin
the
shape
of
his
head
reminded
one
somewhat
of
the
big
sort
of
seal
which
is
called
klakkekal
his
skin
about
the
neck
looked
dark
and
shaggy
and
the
tops
of
his
fingers
grew
together
he
sat
there
with
on
and
his
thick
grey
woollen
stockings
reached
right
up
to
his
thigh
he
wore
besides
plain
freize
clothes
with
bright
glass
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
his
spacious
skin
jacket
was
open
and
round
his
neck
he
had
a
cheap
red
woollen
scarf
when
eilert
came
up
he
made
as
if
he
would
rise
and
said
good
naturedly
good
day
eilert
you
certainly
had
a
hard
time
of
it
now
you
can
sit
down
if
you
like
and
take
a
little
grub
you
want
it
i
sure
and
with
that
he
squirted
out
a
jet
of
tobacco
juice
like
the
spouting
of
a
whale
with
one
foot
which
for
that
special
purpose
all
at
once
grew
extraordinarily
long
he
fished
out
of
a
corner
in
true
nordland
style
the
skull
of
a
whale
to
serve
as
a
chair
for
eilert
and
shoved
forward
with
his
hand
a
long
ship
drawer
full
of
fare
there
was
boiled
groats
with
sirup
cured
fish
oatcakes
with
butter
a
large
stack
of
flatcakes
and
a
multitude
of
the
best
hotel
dishes
besides
the
merman
bade
him
fall
to
and
eat
his
fill
and
ordered
his
daughter
to
bring
out
the
last
keg
of
thronhjem
of
that
sort
the
last
is
always
the
best
said
he
when
she
came
with
it
eilert
thought
he
knew
it
again
it
was
his
father
and
he
himself
only
a
couple
of
days
before
had
bought
the
brandy
from
the
wholesale
dealer
at
kvæford
but
he
did
say
anything
about
that
now
the
quid
of
tobacco
too
which
the
draug
turned
somewhat
impatiently
in
his
mouth
before
he
drank
also
seemed
to
him
wonderfully
like
the
lead
on
his
own
line
at
first
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
did
quite
know
how
to
manage
with
the
keg
his
mouth
was
so
sore
but
afterwards
things
went
along
smoothly
enough
so
they
sat
for
some
time
pretty
silently
and
drank
glass
after
glass
till
eilert
began
to
think
that
they
had
had
quite
enough
so
when
it
came
to
his
turn
again
he
said
no
he
would
rather
not
whereupon
the
merman
put
the
keg
to
his
own
mouth
and
drained
it
to
the
very
dregs
then
he
stretched
his
long
arm
up
to
the
shelf
and
took
down
another
he
was
now
in
a
better
humour
and
began
to
talk
of
all
sorts
of
things
but
every
time
he
laughed
eilert
felt
queer
for
the
draug
mouth
gaped
ominously
wide
and
showed
a
greenish
pointed
row
of
teeth
with
a
long
interval
between
each
tooth
so
that
they
resembled
a
row
of
boat
stakes
the
merman
drained
keg
after
keg
and
with
every
keg
he
grew
more
communicative
with
an
air
as
if
he
were
thinking
in
his
own
mind
of
something
very
funny
he
looked
at
eilert
for
a
while
and
blinked
his
eyes
eilert
did
like
his
expression
at
all
for
it
seemed
to
him
to
say
now
my
lad
whom
i
have
fished
up
so
nicely
look
out
for
a
change
but
instead
of
that
he
said
you
had
a
rough
time
of
it
last
night
eilert
my
boy
but
it
would
have
gone
so
hard
with
you
if
you
had
streaked
the
lines
with
and
refused
to
take
my
daughter
to
church
here
he
suddenly
broke
off
as
if
he
had
said
too
much
and
to
prevent
himself
from
completing
the
sentence
he
put
the
to
his
mouth
once
more
but
the
same
instant
eilert
caught
his
glance
and
it
was
so
full
of
deadly
hatred
that
it
sent
a
shiver
right
down
his
back
when
after
a
long
long
draught
he
again
took
the
keg
from
his
mouth
the
merman
was
again
in
a
good
humour
and
told
tale
after
tale
he
stretched
himself
more
and
more
heavily
out
on
the
sail
and
laughed
and
grinned
complacently
at
his
own
narrations
the
humour
of
which
was
always
a
wreck
or
a
drowning
from
time
to
time
eilert
felt
the
breath
of
his
laughter
and
it
was
like
a
cold
blast
if
folks
would
only
give
up
their
boats
he
said
he
had
no
very
great
desire
for
the
crews
it
was
driftwood
and
that
he
was
after
and
he
really
get
on
without
them
when
his
stock
ran
out
boat
or
ship
he
have
and
surely
nobody
could
blame
him
for
it
either
with
that
he
put
the
keg
down
empty
and
became
somewhat
more
gloomy
again
he
began
to
talk
about
what
bad
times
they
were
for
him
and
her
it
was
not
as
it
used
to
be
he
said
he
stared
blankly
before
him
for
a
time
as
if
buried
in
deep
thought
then
he
stretched
himself
out
backwards
at
full
length
with
feet
extending
right
across
the
floor
and
gasped
so
dreadfully
that
his
upper
and
lower
jaws
resembled
two
boats
keels
facing
each
other
then
he
dozed
right
off
with
his
neck
turned
towards
the
sail
then
the
girl
again
stood
by
eilert
side
and
bade
him
follow
her
they
now
went
the
same
way
back
and
again
ascended
up
to
the
skerry
then
she
confided
to
him
that
the
reason
why
her
father
had
been
so
bitter
against
him
was
because
he
had
mocked
her
with
the
taunt
about
when
she
had
wanted
to
go
to
church
the
name
the
folks
down
below
wanted
to
know
might
the
merman
thought
be
treasured
up
in
eilert
memory
but
during
their
conversation
on
their
way
down
to
her
father
she
had
perceived
that
he
also
had
forgotten
it
and
now
he
must
look
to
his
life
it
would
be
a
good
deal
later
on
in
the
day
before
the
old
fellow
would
begin
inquiring
about
him
till
then
he
eilert
must
sleep
so
as
to
have
sufficient
strength
for
his
flight
she
would
watch
over
him
the
girl
flung
her
long
dark
hair
about
him
like
a
curtain
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
knew
those
eyes
so
well
he
felt
as
if
his
cheek
were
resting
against
the
breast
of
a
white
it
was
so
warm
and
a
single
reddish
feather
in
the
middle
of
it
recalled
a
dark
memory
gradually
he
sank
off
into
a
doze
and
heard
her
singing
a
lullaby
which
reminded
him
of
the
swell
of
the
billows
when
it
ripples
up
and
down
along
the
beach
on
a
fine
sunny
day
it
was
all
about
how
they
had
once
been
playmates
together
and
how
later
on
he
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
of
all
she
sang
however
he
could
only
recollect
the
last
words
which
were
these
oh
thousands
of
times
have
we
played
on
the
shore
and
caught
little
fishes
dost
mind
it
no
more
we
raced
with
the
surf
as
it
rolled
at
our
feet
and
the
lurking
old
merman
we
always
did
cheat
yes
much
shalt
thou
think
of
at
my
lullaby
whilst
the
billows
do
rock
and
the
breezes
do
sigh
who
sits
now
and
weeps
thy
cheeks
it
is
she
who
gave
thee
her
soul
and
whose
soul
lived
in
thee
but
once
as
an
homeward
i
came
thou
didst
lie
a
rock
with
thy
rifle
didst
aim
in
my
breast
thou
didst
strike
me
the
blood
thou
dost
see
is
the
mark
that
i
bear
oh
beloved
one
of
thee
then
it
seemed
to
eilert
as
if
she
sat
and
wept
over
him
and
that
from
time
to
time
a
drop
like
a
splash
of
fell
upon
his
cheek
he
felt
now
that
he
loved
her
so
dearly
the
next
moment
he
again
became
uneasy
he
fancied
that
right
up
to
the
skerry
came
a
whale
which
said
that
he
eilert
must
now
make
haste
and
when
he
stood
on
its
back
he
stuck
the
shaft
of
an
oar
down
its
nostril
to
prevent
it
from
shooting
beneath
the
sea
again
he
perceived
that
in
this
way
the
whale
could
be
steered
accordingly
as
he
turned
the
oar
to
the
right
or
left
and
now
they
coasted
the
whole
land
of
finmark
at
such
a
rate
that
the
huge
mountain
islands
shot
by
them
like
little
rocks
behind
him
he
saw
the
draug
in
his
and
he
was
going
so
swiftly
that
the
foam
stood
high
shortly
afterwards
he
was
again
lying
on
the
skerry
and
the
lass
smiled
so
blithely
she
bent
over
him
and
said
it
is
i
eilert
with
that
he
awoke
and
saw
that
the
sunbeams
were
running
over
the
wet
skerry
and
the
mermaid
was
still
sitting
by
his
side
but
presently
the
whole
thing
changed
before
his
eyes
it
was
the
sun
shining
through
the
on
a
bed
in
the
finn
hut
and
by
his
side
sat
the
finn
girl
supporting
his
back
for
they
thought
he
was
about
to
die
he
had
lain
there
delirious
for
six
weeks
ever
since
the
finn
had
rescued
him
after
capsizing
and
this
was
his
first
moment
of
consciousness
after
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
absurd
and
presumptuous
as
the
twaddle
that
would
fix
a
stigma
of
shame
or
contempt
on
finn
blood
and
the
same
spring
he
and
the
finn
girl
zilla
were
betrothed
and
in
the
autumn
they
were
married
there
were
finns
in
the
bridal
procession
and
perhaps
many
said
a
little
more
about
that
than
they
need
have
done
but
every
one
at
the
wedding
agreed
that
the
fiddler
who
was
also
a
finn
was
the
best
fiddler
in
the
whole
parish
and
the
bride
the
prettiest
girl
homestead
westward
in
the
blue
illustration
homestead
westward
in
the
blue
mountains
the
homestead
westward
in
the
blue
mountains
there
was
once
a
farmer
son
who
was
off
to
moen
for
the
annual
manoeuvres
he
was
to
be
the
drummer
and
his
way
lay
right
across
the
mountains
there
he
could
practise
his
drumming
at
his
ease
and
beat
his
tattoos
again
and
again
without
making
folks
laugh
or
having
a
parcel
of
small
boys
dangling
about
him
like
so
many
midges
every
time
he
passed
a
mountain
homestead
he
beat
his
to
bring
the
girls
out
and
they
stood
and
hung
about
and
gaped
after
him
at
all
the
farmhouses
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
hottest
summer
weather
he
had
been
practising
his
drumming
from
early
in
the
morning
till
he
had
grown
quite
sick
and
tired
of
it
and
now
he
was
toiling
up
a
steep
cliff
and
had
slung
his
drum
over
his
shoulder
and
stuck
his
drumsticks
in
his
bandoleer
the
sun
baked
and
broiled
upon
the
hills
but
in
the
clefts
there
was
a
coolness
as
of
a
rushing
roaring
waterfall
the
little
knolls
swarmed
with
bilberries
the
whole
way
along
and
he
felt
he
must
stoop
down
and
pluck
whole
handfuls
at
a
time
so
that
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
top
then
he
came
to
a
hilly
slope
where
the
ferns
stood
high
and
there
were
lots
of
birch
bushes
it
was
so
nice
and
shady
there
he
thought
and
so
he
could
for
the
life
of
him
help
taking
a
rest
his
drum
he
took
off
his
jacket
he
put
beneath
his
head
and
his
cap
over
his
face
and
off
he
went
to
sleep
but
as
he
lay
dozing
there
he
dreamt
that
some
one
was
tickling
him
under
the
nose
with
a
straw
so
that
he
could
get
no
peace
and
the
instant
he
awoke
he
fancied
he
heard
laughing
and
giggling
the
sun
had
by
this
time
begun
to
cast
oblique
shadows
and
far
down
below
towards
the
valleys
lay
the
warm
steaming
vapours
creeping
upwards
in
long
gossamer
bands
and
ribands
of
mist
as
he
reached
behind
him
for
his
jacket
he
saw
a
snake
which
lay
and
looked
at
him
with
such
shrewd
quick
eyes
but
when
he
threw
a
stone
at
it
it
caught
its
tail
in
its
mouth
and
trundled
away
like
a
wheel
again
there
was
a
giggling
and
a
sniggering
among
the
bushes
and
now
he
heard
it
among
some
birch
trees
which
stood
in
such
a
wonderful
sunlight
for
they
were
filled
with
the
rain
and
fine
drizzle
of
a
waterfall
the
glistened
and
sparkled
so
that
he
really
could
see
the
trees
properly
but
it
was
as
though
something
were
moving
about
in
them
and
he
could
have
sworn
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fine
bright
slim
damsel
who
was
laughing
and
making
fun
of
him
she
peeped
at
him
from
beneath
her
hand
because
of
the
sun
and
her
sleeves
were
tucked
up
a
little
while
afterwards
a
blouse
appeared
above
the
brushwood
he
was
after
it
in
an
instant
he
ran
and
ran
till
he
had
half
a
mind
to
give
up
but
then
a
frock
and
a
bare
shoulder
gleamed
betwixt
an
opening
in
the
leaves
and
off
again
he
pelted
as
hard
as
he
could
till
he
began
to
think
that
it
must
have
all
been
imagination
then
he
saw
her
right
in
a
corner
of
the
green
bushes
her
hair
had
been
torn
out
of
its
plaits
from
the
speed
with
which
she
had
flown
through
the
bushes
she
stood
still
and
looked
back
as
if
she
were
terribly
frightened
but
the
lad
thought
to
himself
that
if
she
had
run
away
with
his
drumsticks
she
should
pay
for
it
and
off
they
ran
again
she
in
front
and
he
behind
now
and
again
she
turned
round
and
laughed
and
gibed
and
gave
a
toss
and
a
twist
so
that
it
looked
as
if
her
long
wavy
hair
were
writhing
and
wriggling
and
twisting
like
a
serpent
tail
at
last
she
turned
round
on
the
top
of
the
hill
laughed
and
held
out
his
drumsticks
towards
him
but
now
he
was
determined
to
catch
her
he
was
so
near
that
he
made
grab
after
grab
at
her
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
lay
hold
of
her
hard
by
a
fence
she
was
over
it
while
he
tumbled
after
her
into
the
enclosure
of
a
homestead
then
she
cried
and
shouted
up
to
the
house
randi
and
brandi
and
gyri
and
gunna
and
four
girls
came
rushing
down
over
the
sward
but
the
last
of
them
who
had
a
fine
ruddy
complexion
and
heavy
hair
stood
and
greeted
him
so
graciously
with
her
downcast
eyes
as
if
she
was
quite
distressed
that
they
should
play
such
wanton
pranks
with
a
strange
young
man
she
stood
there
abashed
and
uncertain
poor
thing
just
like
a
child
who
knows
not
whether
it
should
say
something
or
not
but
all
the
while
she
sidled
up
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
then
when
she
was
so
close
to
him
that
her
hair
almost
touched
him
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
wide
and
looked
straight
at
him
but
she
had
a
frightfully
sharp
look
in
those
eyes
of
hers
rather
come
with
me
and
thou
shalt
have
dancing
or
art
thou
tired
my
lad
cried
a
girl
with
hair
and
a
wild
dark
fire
in
her
eyes
she
tripped
up
and
down
and
clapped
her
hands
she
had
white
teeth
and
hot
breath
and
would
have
dragged
him
off
with
her
tie
thyself
up
behind
first
black
gyri
giggled
the
others
and
immediately
she
let
the
lad
go
and
wobbled
and
twisted
and
went
backwards
so
oddly
he
could
help
staring
after
the
black
lassie
who
stood
and
writhed
and
twisted
so
uncomfortably
as
if
she
were
concealing
something
behind
her
and
had
all
at
once
become
so
meek
but
the
fine
bright
girl
with
the
slim
slender
waist
who
had
rushed
on
before
him
and
who
seemed
to
him
the
loveliest
of
them
all
began
to
laugh
at
him
again
and
tease
him
run
as
he
might
he
should
catch
her
she
jibed
and
jeered
never
should
he
find
his
drumsticks
again
she
said
but
then
her
mood
shifted
right
round
and
she
flung
herself
down
headlong
and
began
to
cry
she
had
followed
his
drumming
the
whole
day
she
said
and
never
had
she
heard
any
fellow
who
could
beat
so
well
nor
had
she
ever
seen
a
lad
who
was
so
handsome
while
he
was
asleep
i
kissed
thee
then
said
she
and
smiled
up
at
him
so
sorrowfully
beware
of
the
serpent
tongue
lest
it
bite
thee
swain
tis
worst
of
all
when
it
licks
thee
first
whispered
the
bashful
one
with
the
hair
she
would
fain
have
stolen
between
them
so
softly
and
all
at
once
the
swain
recollected
the
snake
which
was
as
slender
and
supple
and
quick
and
sparkling
as
the
girl
who
lay
there
on
the
and
wept
and
made
fun
at
the
same
time
and
looked
oddly
alert
and
wary
but
a
stooping
somewhat
clumsy
little
thing
now
stuck
her
head
quickly
in
between
and
smiled
shamefacedly
at
him
as
if
she
knew
and
could
tell
him
so
much
her
eyes
sparkled
a
long
way
inwards
and
across
her
face
there
passed
a
sort
of
pale
golden
gleam
as
when
the
last
sunbeam
slowly
draws
away
from
the
grassy
mountain
slope
at
my
place
said
she
thou
shalt
hear
such
as
none
else
has
ever
heard
i
will
play
for
thee
and
thou
shalt
listen
to
things
unknown
to
others
thou
shalt
hear
all
that
sings
and
laughs
and
cries
in
the
roots
of
trees
and
in
the
mountains
and
in
all
things
that
grow
so
that
thou
wilt
never
trouble
thy
head
about
anything
else
in
the
world
then
there
was
a
scornful
laugh
and
up
on
a
rock
he
saw
a
tall
strongly
built
girl
with
a
gold
band
in
her
hair
and
a
huge
wand
in
her
hand
she
lifted
a
long
wooden
trumpet
with
such
splendid
powerful
arms
threw
back
her
neck
with
such
a
proud
and
resolute
air
and
stood
firm
and
fast
as
a
rock
while
she
blew
and
it
sounded
far
and
wide
through
the
summer
evening
and
rang
back
again
across
the
hills
but
she
the
prettiest
and
daintiest
of
them
all
who
had
cast
herself
on
the
ground
stuck
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
mimicked
her
and
laughed
and
jeered
then
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
her
blue
eyes
peeping
through
her
hair
and
whispered
if
thou
dost
want
me
swain
thou
must
pick
me
up
she
has
a
strong
firm
grip
for
a
gentle
maiden
thought
he
to
himself
as
he
raised
her
from
the
ground
but
thou
must
catch
me
first
cried
she
and
right
towards
the
house
they
ran
she
first
and
he
after
her
suddenly
she
stopped
short
and
putting
both
arms
akimbo
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
dost
like
me
she
asked
the
swain
could
say
no
to
that
he
had
now
got
hold
of
her
and
would
have
put
his
arm
round
her
is
for
thee
to
have
a
word
in
the
matter
father
she
shouted
all
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
house
this
swain
here
would
fain
wed
me
and
she
drew
him
hastily
towards
the
hut
door
there
sat
a
little
old
fellow
with
a
cap
like
a
on
his
head
staring
at
the
livestock
on
the
he
had
a
large
silver
jug
in
front
of
him
is
the
homestead
westward
in
the
blue
mountains
that
he
after
i
know
said
the
old
man
nodding
his
head
with
a
sly
look
in
his
eyes
haw
haw
that
what
they
after
is
it
thought
the
swain
but
aloud
he
said
is
a
great
offer
i
know
but
methinks
is
a
little
hasty
too
down
our
way
is
the
custom
to
send
two
first
of
all
to
arrange
matters
properly
thou
send
two
before
thee
and
here
they
be
quoth
she
smartly
and
produced
his
drumsticks
and
is
usual
with
us
moreover
to
have
a
look
over
the
property
first
though
the
lass
herself
have
wit
enough
and
to
spare
added
he
then
she
all
at
once
grew
so
small
and
there
was
a
nasty
green
glitter
in
her
eyes
hast
thou
not
run
after
me
the
livelong
day
and
wooed
me
right
down
in
the
enclosure
there
so
that
my
father
both
heard
and
saw
it
all
cried
she
pretty
lasses
are
wont
to
hold
back
a
bit
said
the
swain
in
a
wheedling
sort
of
way
he
perceived
that
he
must
be
a
little
subtle
here
it
was
not
all
love
in
this
wooing
then
she
seemed
to
bend
her
body
backwards
into
a
complete
curve
and
shot
forward
her
head
and
neck
and
her
eyes
sparkled
but
the
old
fellow
lifted
his
stick
from
his
knee
and
she
stood
there
again
as
blithe
and
sportive
as
ever
she
stretched
herself
out
tall
and
stiff
with
her
hands
in
her
silver
girdle
and
she
looked
right
into
his
eyes
and
laughed
and
asked
him
if
he
was
one
of
those
fellows
who
were
afraid
of
the
girls
if
he
wanted
her
he
might
perchance
be
run
off
his
legs
again
said
she
then
she
began
tripping
up
and
down
and
curtseying
and
making
fun
of
him
again
but
all
at
once
he
saw
on
the
sward
behind
her
what
looked
like
the
shadow
of
something
that
whisked
and
frisked
and
writhed
round
and
round
and
twisted
in
and
out
according
as
she
practised
her
wheedling
ways
upon
him
that
is
a
very
curious
long
sort
of
riband
thought
the
drummer
to
himself
in
his
amazement
they
were
in
a
great
hurry
too
to
get
him
under
the
yoke
he
thought
but
they
should
find
that
a
soldier
on
his
way
to
the
manoeuvres
is
not
to
be
betrothed
and
married
offhand
so
he
told
them
bluntly
that
he
had
come
hither
for
his
drumsticks
and
not
to
woo
maidens
and
he
would
thank
them
to
let
him
have
his
property
but
have
a
look
about
you
a
bit
first
young
man
said
the
old
fellow
and
he
pointed
with
his
stick
and
all
at
once
the
drummer
saw
large
dun
cows
grazing
all
along
the
mountain
pastures
and
the
rang
out
their
merry
peals
buckets
and
vats
of
the
brightest
copper
shone
all
about
and
never
had
he
seen
such
shapely
and
nicely
dressed
milkmaids
there
must
needs
be
great
wealth
here
perchance
thou
dost
think
is
but
a
beggarly
inheritance
i
have
here
in
the
blue
mountains
said
she
and
sitting
down
on
a
haycock
she
began
chatting
with
him
but
we
four
such
as
this
and
what
i
inherit
from
my
mother
is
twelve
times
as
large
but
the
drummer
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
they
were
rather
too
anxious
to
settle
the
property
upon
him
thought
he
so
he
declared
that
in
so
serious
a
matter
he
must
crave
a
little
time
for
consideration
then
the
lass
began
to
cry
and
take
on
and
asked
him
if
he
meant
to
befool
a
poor
innocent
ignorant
young
thing
and
pursue
her
and
drive
her
out
of
her
very
wits
she
had
put
all
her
hope
and
trust
in
him
she
said
and
with
that
she
fell
she
sat
there
quite
inconsolable
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
with
all
her
hair
over
her
eyes
till
at
last
the
drummer
began
to
feel
quite
sorry
for
her
and
almost
angry
with
himself
she
was
certainly
most
and
confiding
all
at
once
she
twisted
round
and
threw
herself
petulantly
down
from
the
haycock
her
eyes
spied
all
about
and
seemed
quite
tiny
and
piercing
as
she
looked
up
at
him
and
laughed
and
jested
he
started
back
it
was
exactly
as
if
he
again
saw
the
snake
beneath
the
birch
tree
down
there
when
it
trundled
away
and
now
he
wanted
to
be
off
as
quickly
as
possible
he
cared
no
longer
about
being
civil
then
she
reared
up
with
a
hissing
sound
she
quite
forgot
herself
and
a
long
tail
hung
down
and
whisked
about
from
behind
her
kirtle
he
should
escape
her
in
that
way
she
shrieked
he
should
first
of
all
have
a
taste
of
public
penance
and
public
opinion
from
parish
to
parish
and
then
she
called
her
father
then
the
drummer
felt
a
grip
on
his
jacket
and
he
was
lifted
right
off
his
legs
he
was
chucked
into
an
empty
and
the
door
was
shut
behind
him
there
he
stood
and
had
nothing
to
look
at
but
an
old
through
a
crack
in
the
door
who
had
odd
yellow
eyes
and
was
very
much
like
the
old
fellow
and
a
sunbeam
through
a
little
hole
which
sunbeam
crept
higher
and
higher
up
the
blank
stable
wall
till
late
in
the
evening
when
it
went
out
altogether
but
towards
night
a
voice
outside
said
softly
swain
swain
and
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
a
shadow
cross
the
little
hole
hist
hist
the
old
man
is
sleeping
at
the
other
side
of
the
wall
it
sounded
he
knew
by
the
voice
that
it
was
she
the
one
who
had
behaved
so
prettily
and
been
so
bashful
the
moment
he
had
come
upon
the
scene
thou
but
say
that
thou
dost
know
that
has
had
a
lover
before
or
they
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
her
off
their
hands
with
a
dowry
thou
must
know
that
the
homestead
westwards
in
the
blue
mountains
is
mine
and
answer
the
old
man
that
it
was
me
brandi
that
thou
didst
run
after
all
the
time
hist
hist
here
comes
the
old
man
she
whispered
and
whisked
away
but
a
shadow
again
fell
across
the
little
hole
in
the
moonlight
and
the
one
stuck
her
head
in
and
peeped
at
him
swain
swain
art
thou
awake
that
will
make
thee
the
laughingstock
of
the
neighbourhood
she
spiteful
and
she
stings
but
the
homestead
westward
in
the
blue
mountains
is
mine
and
when
i
play
there
the
gates
beneath
the
high
mountains
fly
open
and
through
them
lies
the
road
to
the
nameless
powers
of
nature
do
but
say
that
was
me
randi
thou
wert
running
after
because
she
plays
so
prettily
on
the
hist
hist
the
old
man
is
stirring
about
by
the
wall
she
beckoned
to
him
and
was
gone
a
little
afterwards
nearly
every
bit
of
the
hole
was
darkened
and
he
recognised
the
black
one
by
her
voice
swain
swain
she
hissed
i
had
to
bind
up
my
kirtle
behind
said
she
so
we
could
go
dancing
the
together
on
the
green
sward
but
the
homestead
in
the
blue
mountains
is
my
lawful
property
and
tell
the
old
man
that
it
was
madcap
gyri
thou
wast
running
after
because
thou
art
so
madly
fond
of
dancing
jigs
and
then
she
clapped
her
hands
aloud
and
straightway
was
full
of
fear
lest
she
should
have
awakened
the
old
man
and
she
was
gone
but
the
lad
sat
inside
there
and
thought
it
all
over
and
looked
up
at
the
thin
pale
summer
moon
and
he
thought
that
never
in
his
whole
life
had
he
been
in
such
evil
case
from
time
to
time
he
heard
something
moving
scraping
and
snorting
against
the
wall
outside
it
was
the
old
fellow
who
lay
there
and
kept
watch
over
him
thou
swain
thou
said
another
voice
at
the
it
was
she
who
had
planted
herself
so
firmly
on
the
rock
with
such
sturdy
hips
and
such
a
masterful
voice
for
these
three
hundred
years
have
i
been
blowing
the
here
in
the
summer
evenings
far
and
wide
but
never
has
it
drawn
any
one
westward
hither
into
the
blue
mountains
and
let
me
tell
thee
that
we
are
all
homeless
and
houseless
and
all
thou
seest
here
is
but
glitter
and
glamour
many
a
man
has
been
befooled
hither
time
out
of
mind
but
i
wo
have
the
other
lasses
married
before
me
and
rather
than
that
any
one
of
them
should
get
thee
i
free
thee
from
the
mountains
mark
me
now
when
the
sun
is
hot
and
high
the
old
man
will
get
frightened
and
crawl
into
his
corner
then
look
to
thyself
shove
hard
against
the
door
of
the
hayloft
and
hasten
to
get
thee
over
the
fence
and
thou
wilt
be
rid
of
us
the
drummer
was
not
slow
to
follow
this
counsel
he
crept
out
the
moment
the
sun
began
to
burn
and
cleared
the
fence
with
one
good
bound
in
less
than
no
time
he
was
down
in
the
valley
again
and
far
far
away
towards
sunrise
in
the
mountains
he
heard
the
sound
of
her
he
threw
his
drum
across
his
shoulder
and
hied
him
off
to
the
manoeuvres
at
moen
but
never
would
he
play
and
beat
the
tattoo
before
the
lasses
again
lest
he
should
find
himself
westwards
in
the
blue
mountains
before
he
was
well
aware
of
it
a
long
slow
dance
and
the
music
to
it
a
swed
is
a
remote
pasturage
with
huts
upon
it
where
the
cows
are
tended
and
dairy
produce
prepared
for
market
and
home
use
during
the
summer
a
country
dance
of
a
boisterous
sort
a
long
wooden
trumpet
illustration
it
me
it
me
they
had
chatted
so
long
about
the
lasses
down
in
the
valley
and
what
a
fine
time
they
had
of
it
there
that
gygra
daughter
grew
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
and
began
to
heave
rocks
against
the
mountain
side
she
was
bent
upon
taking
service
in
the
valley
below
said
she
then
go
down
to
the
ground
gnome
first
and
grind
thy
nose
down
and
tidy
thyself
up
a
bit
and
stick
a
comb
in
thy
hair
instead
of
an
iron
rake
said
the
dwellers
in
the
mountains
so
gygra
daughter
tramped
along
in
the
middle
of
the
river
till
the
foss
steamed
and
the
storm
whirled
round
about
her
down
she
went
to
the
ground
gnome
and
was
scoured
and
scrubbed
and
combed
out
finely
one
evening
a
wench
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
if
she
could
be
taken
into
service
you
must
be
cook
then
said
madame
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
wench
was
one
who
would
stir
the
porridge
finely
and
would
make
no
bones
about
a
little
extra
and
so
they
took
her
on
she
was
a
roughish
colt
and
her
ways
were
roughish
too
the
first
time
she
carried
in
a
load
of
wood
she
shoved
so
violently
against
the
kitchen
door
that
she
burst
its
hinges
and
however
many
times
the
carpenter
might
mend
the
door
it
always
remained
hingeless
for
she
burst
it
open
with
her
foot
every
time
she
brought
in
wood
when
she
washed
up
too
heaps
and
heaps
of
pots
and
pans
were
piled
up
from
meal
to
meal
so
that
the
kitchen
shelves
and
tables
could
hold
no
more
and
bustle
about
as
she
might
they
never
seemed
to
grow
less
nor
had
her
mistress
a
much
better
opinion
of
her
scouring
when
toad
for
so
they
called
her
set
to
work
with
the
and
scrubbed
with
all
her
might
the
wooden
tin
and
pewter
vessels
would
no
doubt
have
looked
downright
bonny
if
they
had
broken
to
bits
beneath
her
hands
and
when
her
mistress
tried
to
show
her
how
it
ought
to
be
done
she
only
gasped
and
gaped
such
sets
of
cracked
cups
and
such
rows
of
chipped
and
handleless
jugs
and
dishes
had
never
before
been
seen
in
that
kitchen
and
then
too
she
ate
as
much
as
all
the
other
servants
put
together
so
her
mistress
complained
to
her
master
and
said
that
the
sooner
they
were
well
quit
of
her
the
better
out
into
the
kitchen
went
the
general
dealer
straightway
he
was
quite
red
in
the
face
and
flung
open
the
till
it
creaked
again
he
would
let
her
know
he
said
that
she
was
not
there
to
only
stand
with
her
back
to
the
fire
and
warm
her
dirty
self
now
when
he
saw
the
lazy
sluttish
beast
lounging
over
the
kitchen
bench
and
doing
nothing
but
gape
through
the
at
his
boats
which
lay
down
by
the
bridge
laden
with
he
was
downright
furious
pack
yourself
off
this
instant
said
he
but
toad
showed
her
teeth
and
grinned
and
blinked
up
at
him
and
said
that
as
master
himself
had
come
into
the
kitchen
he
should
see
that
she
did
not
eat
his
bread
for
nothing
then
she
slouched
down
to
the
boats
and
snorted
back
at
him
with
her
arm
before
her
face
before
any
one
could
guess
what
she
was
after
she
had
one
of
the
heavy
hogsheads
of
on
her
back
and
back
she
came
through
the
kitchen
door
all
smirking
and
smiling
and
begged
father
to
be
so
good
as
to
tell
her
where
she
was
to
put
it
he
simply
stood
and
gaped
at
her
such
a
thing
he
had
never
seen
before
and
hogshead
after
hogshead
she
carried
from
the
boat
right
up
into
the
shop
the
general
dealer
laughed
till
he
quite
gasped
for
breath
and
slapped
his
thighs
so
far
as
his
big
belly
would
let
him
reach
them
nor
was
he
sparing
of
compliments
and
into
the
he
rushed
almost
as
quickly
as
he
had
rushed
out
of
it
mother
has
no
idea
what
a
capital
wench
she
has
got
said
he
but
ever
after
that
she
put
her
hand
to
nothing
nay
not
so
much
as
to
drive
a
wooden
peg
into
the
wall
and
if
some
one
else
had
warmed
up
a
thing
or
two
now
and
then
there
would
have
been
very
little
to
eat
in
the
house
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
get
her
away
from
the
fireside
at
meal
times
when
her
mistress
complained
about
it
her
master
said
that
she
to
expect
too
much
the
lass
surely
required
a
little
rest
now
and
again
after
carrying
such
drayman
loads
as
she
did
but
toad
always
had
an
ogle
and
a
grin
ready
at
such
times
as
the
general
dealer
came
through
the
door
from
the
shop
then
she
grew
quick
and
lively
enough
and
went
on
all
sorts
of
errands
whether
it
was
with
the
bucket
to
the
spring
or
to
the
storehouse
for
bread
and
when
she
saw
that
her
mistress
was
out
of
the
way
she
took
it
upon
herself
to
do
exactly
as
she
liked
both
in
this
and
in
that
no
sooner
was
the
pot
hung
on
the
than
she
would
slip
away
with
a
big
saucer
and
fetch
sirup
from
the
shop
and
she
would
flounce
down
before
the
porridge
dish
and
gobble
to
her
heart
content
if
any
of
her
claimed
an
equal
share
she
would
simply
answer
it
me
they
dared
not
rebel
since
the
day
she
had
taken
up
the
hogsheads
of
they
knew
that
she
had
master
on
her
side
but
her
mistress
was
not
slow
to
mark
the
diminishing
both
of
the
and
the
powdered
sugar
and
she
perceived
also
in
which
direction
the
gingerbreads
and
all
the
butter
and
bacon
went
for
out
the
wench
would
come
munching
rye
cakes
and
licking
the
sirup
from
her
fingers
and
she
grew
as
round
and
thick
and
fat
as
if
she
would
burst
when
her
mistress
took
away
and
kept
the
key
toad
would
poke
her
head
into
the
parlour
door
and
ogle
and
writhe
at
the
general
dealer
and
ask
if
there
was
anything
to
carry
up
to
the
and
then
he
would
go
to
the
window
and
watch
her
as
she
lifted
and
carried
kegs
of
fish
and
casks
of
sugar
and
sacks
of
meal
he
laughed
till
he
coughed
again
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
would
bellow
all
over
the
place
can
any
one
of
my
labouring
men
carry
loads
like
toad
can
and
when
her
master
came
home
dripping
wet
and
benumbed
with
cold
from
his
first
autumn
voyage
it
was
toad
who
was
first
and
foremost
to
meet
him
and
unbutton
his
jacket
for
him
and
undo
his
and
help
him
off
with
his
long
he
shivered
and
shook
but
she
was
not
slow
to
wring
out
his
wet
stockings
for
him
and
fetch
no
end
of
birch
bark
and
huge
logs
then
she
made
up
a
regular
bonfire
in
the
fireplace
and
placed
him
cosily
in
the
chimney
corner
madame
came
to
give
her
husband
some
warm
ale
posset
but
she
was
so
annoyed
to
see
the
wench
whisking
and
bustling
about
him
that
she
went
up
into
the
parlour
and
howled
with
rage
early
in
the
morning
the
general
dealer
bawled
and
shouted
downstairs
for
his
long
worsted
stockings
they
could
hear
that
he
was
peevish
and
cross
because
he
had
to
put
on
his
and
cramped
and
go
out
again
into
the
foul
weather
he
tore
open
the
kitchen
door
and
asked
them
furiously
how
much
longer
they
were
going
to
keep
him
waiting
but
now
his
mouth
grew
as
wide
open
as
the
he
stood
in
and
his
face
quite
lit
up
with
satisfaction
round
about
the
walls
and
in
the
warmth
of
the
chimney
corner
hung
his
and
his
jacket
and
his
trousers
and
every
blessed
bit
of
clothes
he
was
to
put
on
as
dry
as
tinder
and
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
bench
he
saw
his
large
standing
there
so
snug
and
so
nicely
greased
that
the
grease
ran
right
down
the
shafts
and
over
the
straps
such
a
servant
for
looking
after
him
and
taking
care
of
him
he
had
not
believed
it
possible
to
get
for
love
or
money
cried
the
general
dealer
but
now
his
wife
could
contain
herself
no
longer
she
showed
him
that
the
clothes
were
both
scorched
and
burned
and
that
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
oilskin
jacket
was
crumpled
up
with
heat
and
cracked
if
one
pulled
it
never
so
lightly
and
in
she
dragged
the
big
that
he
might
see
for
himself
how
the
wench
had
stuck
both
his
boots
in
it
and
used
it
to
grease
them
with
but
the
general
dealer
stood
there
quite
dumfoundered
and
glanced
now
at
the
boots
and
now
at
the
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
his
face
twitched
and
then
he
began
to
wipe
away
his
tears
he
hastened
to
go
in
that
they
might
not
see
that
he
was
weeping
mother
does
not
know
how
kindly
the
wench
has
meant
it
all
he
sobbed
good
heavens
what
if
she
used
butter
for
his
boots
if
she
had
only
well
never
would
he
turn
such
a
lass
out
of
the
house
then
the
wife
gave
it
up
altogether
and
let
the
big
kitchen
wench
rule
as
best
she
might
and
it
was
not
very
long
either
before
toad
let
the
key
of
the
remain
in
the
door
from
morn
till
eve
when
any
one
bawled
out
to
her
who
inside
there
she
would
simply
answer
it
me
and
she
did
budge
from
the
as
she
sat
there
and
ate
even
for
madame
herself
but
she
always
had
an
eye
upon
her
master
the
general
dealer
but
he
only
jested
with
her
and
asked
her
if
she
got
food
enough
and
said
that
he
was
afraid
he
would
one
day
find
her
starved
to
death
towards
christmas
time
when
folks
were
making
ready
to
go
madame
was
busy
betimes
and
bustled
about
as
usual
and
got
the
great
caldron
taken
down
into
the
for
washing
and
the
cooks
hired
for
the
occasion
rolled
out
the
and
baked
and
frizzled
on
the
flat
and
they
brought
in
herring
kegs
from
the
shop
and
meal
and
meat
both
cured
and
fresh
and
weighed
and
measured
and
laid
in
stores
of
provisions
but
then
it
seemed
to
toad
as
if
she
had
a
moment
peace
for
prying
into
pots
and
pans
her
mistress
was
going
backwards
and
forwards
continually
between
and
pantry
after
meal
or
sugar
or
butter
or
sirup
for
the
the
door
was
ajar
for
her
all
day
long
so
at
last
toad
grew
downright
wild
she
was
determined
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
racket
so
she
took
it
upon
her
to
well
smear
the
threshold
of
the
with
green
soap
next
morning
her
mistress
came
bustling
along
first
thing
with
butter
and
a
wooden
ladle
in
a
bowl
and
she
slipped
and
fell
in
the
opening
between
the
stairs
and
the
door
there
she
lay
till
toad
dragged
her
up
she
carried
her
in
to
her
husband
with
such
a
crying
and
yelling
that
it
was
heard
all
over
the
depôt
madame
had
been
regularly
worrying
herself
to
death
with
all
this
bustle
said
she
and
now
the
poor
soul
had
fallen
and
broken
her
leg
but
the
one
who
cried
the
most
and
did
know
what
to
do
with
himself
when
he
heard
such
weeping
and
wailing
over
his
wife
was
the
general
dealer
none
knew
the
real
worth
of
that
kitchen
wench
said
he
and
so
it
was
toad
who
now
superintended
everything
and
both
dispensed
the
stores
and
made
provision
for
the
household
she
drove
all
the
hired
cooks
and
pancake
rollers
out
of
the
house
they
were
only
eating
her
master
out
of
house
and
home
she
said
the
were
laid
together
without
any
sirup
between
them
and
she
gave
out
fat
instead
of
butter
she
distributed
it
herself
and
packed
it
up
in
their
never
had
the
general
dealer
known
the
heavy
household
business
disposed
of
so
quickly
as
it
was
that
year
he
was
quite
astonished
and
he
was
really
dumfoundered
when
toad
took
him
up
into
the
and
showed
him
how
little
had
been
consumed
and
how
the
cured
shoulders
of
mutton
and
the
hams
hung
down
from
the
rafters
in
rows
and
rows
so
long
as
things
went
on
as
they
were
going
now
said
he
she
should
have
the
control
of
the
household
like
mother
herself
for
his
wife
was
now
bedridden
in
her
room
upstairs
and
at
toad
baked
and
roasted
and
cut
things
down
so
finely
that
her
were
almost
driven
to
chew
their
wooden
spoons
and
gnaw
bones
but
such
fat
calves
and
such
ribs
of
pork
and
such
filled
with
both
sirup
and
butter
and
such
and
splendid
fare
for
the
guests
that
came
to
his
house
at
the
general
dealer
had
never
seen
before
then
the
general
dealer
took
her
by
the
arm
and
right
down
into
the
shop
they
both
went
together
she
might
take
what
she
would
said
he
both
of
kirtles
and
neckerchiefs
and
other
finery
so
that
she
might
dress
and
go
in
and
out
as
if
she
were
mother
herself
and
she
might
provide
herself
with
beads
and
silk
as
much
as
she
liked
there
was
nothing
that
she
might
not
have
but
when
the
bailiff
and
the
sexton
sat
at
cards
and
toad
came
in
to
lay
the
they
were
like
to
have
rolled
off
their
chairs
such
a
sight
they
had
never
seen
before
toad
had
rigged
herself
up
with
all
manner
of
and
trimmed
her
hairy
poll
with
blue
and
yellow
and
green
ribbons
till
it
looked
like
a
tail
but
they
said
nothing
for
the
sake
of
the
general
dealer
who
thought
she
looked
so
smart
and
was
calling
her
in
continually
and
they
were
forced
to
confess
that
the
wench
spared
neither
meat
nor
ale
nor
brandy
and
on
the
third
evening
when
they
got
so
drunk
that
they
lay
there
like
logs
she
carried
them
off
to
bed
as
if
they
were
sucking
babes
and
so
it
went
on
with
feasting
and
entertaining
right
up
to
the
twentieth
day
after
christmas
day
and
beyond
it
and
that
wench
toad
used
to
smirk
and
stare
about
the
room
and
whenever
they
did
laugh
or
jest
enough
with
her
she
would
plant
herself
right
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
turn
herself
about
in
all
her
finery
to
attract
notice
and
say
it
me
and
when
the
guests
left
the
house
they
must
needs
admit
that
the
general
dealer
was
right
when
he
said
that
such
were
not
to
be
picked
up
every
day
but
those
folks
who
went
for
the
general
dealer
and
had
their
provisions
put
up
for
them
beforehand
were
not
slow
to
mark
that
toad
had
the
control
of
the
shop
and
stores
likewise
so
it
happened
as
might
only
have
been
expected
their
provisions
ran
short
and
they
had
to
return
home
just
as
the
cod
was
biting
best
while
all
the
other
fishermen
sailed
further
out
and
made
hauls
the
general
dealer
was
like
to
have
had
apoplexy
on
the
day
that
he
saw
his
boats
lying
empty
by
the
bridge
in
the
height
of
the
fishing
season
his
men
came
up
in
a
body
to
the
shop
headed
by
their
eldest
foreman
and
laid
a
complaint
before
him
the
food
that
had
been
packed
into
their
boxes
and
baskets
they
said
could
be
called
human
food
at
all
the
were
so
hard
they
said
that
it
was
munch
munch
all
day
there
was
only
rancid
fat
on
them
with
scarcely
a
glimpse
of
bacon
and
as
for
the
cured
shoulders
of
mutton
one
had
scarcely
shaved
off
a
thin
slice
when
one
scraped
against
the
bare
bone
up
into
the
went
the
general
dealer
like
a
shot
but
as
for
toad
she
smote
her
hands
above
her
head
and
said
that
it
was
as
much
as
he
the
general
dealer
could
manage
to
meet
the
heavy
expenses
for
and
and
nets
and
lines
without
having
to
provide
his
fishermen
with
salt
herring
and
bacon
and
fresh
butter
and
and
ground
coffee
into
the
bargain
they
had
no
need
to
starve
when
they
had
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
right
under
their
noses
said
she
and
then
she
handed
him
as
a
specimen
one
of
his
own
which
she
had
filled
with
butter
and
sirup
herself
and
let
him
taste
it
and
he
tasted
it
and
ate
and
ate
till
the
sirup
ran
down
both
corners
of
his
mouth
such
good
greasy
he
had
never
tasted
before
then
the
general
dealer
gave
them
a
bit
of
his
mind
he
was
as
red
as
a
and
out
of
the
they
went
head
first
some
three
yards
and
some
four
according
as
he
got
a
good
grip
of
them
and
old
thore
who
had
steered
the
big
both
for
him
and
his
father
was
discharged
but
kjel
the
herdsman
had
hid
himself
out
of
the
way
up
on
the
whilst
the
row
was
going
on
and
the
general
dealer
was
shrieking
and
bellowing
his
worst
in
the
yard
below
and
he
stood
there
and
peeped
through
the
little
window
then
he
saw
his
mistress
who
had
been
out
of
bed
for
nine
weeks
hobble
forward
and
stare
out
of
her
bedroom
window
she
took
on
terribly
and
cried
and
wrung
her
thin
hands
when
she
saw
their
old
foreman
told
to
go
to
the
devil
and
shamble
off
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
as
if
he
were
deranged
but
she
dared
not
so
much
as
shout
a
word
of
comfort
after
him
for
there
stood
toad
big
and
broad
in
the
door
with
a
platter
of
in
her
hand
and
shook
her
fist
after
him
then
kjel
was
like
to
have
wept
too
that
stout
toad
should
not
grease
herself
shiny
with
fat
much
longer
in
house
or
he
know
the
reason
why
thought
kjel
and
from
thenceforth
kjel
kept
a
strict
watch
upon
her
there
were
lots
of
things
going
on
that
he
could
make
out
at
all
towards
when
they
put
the
mast
into
the
large
new
yacht
which
was
to
take
the
first
trading
voyage
to
bergen
the
general
dealer
was
so
glad
that
he
was
running
up
and
down
from
the
bridge
to
the
house
the
whole
day
he
had
never
imagined
that
the
yacht
would
have
turned
out
so
fine
and
stately
and
when
they
had
the
tackle
and
the
shrouds
all
ready
and
were
hoisting
away
at
the
yards
he
spun
round
on
his
heel
and
snapped
his
fingers
that
lass
toad
should
go
with
him
to
bergen
said
he
she
had
never
seen
the
town
poor
thing
while
as
for
mother
she
had
been
there
three
times
already
but
it
seemed
to
kjel
that
he
saw
more
in
this
than
other
people
saw
as
for
toad
when
she
heard
she
was
to
go
to
bergen
she
regularly
turned
the
house
upside
down
there
was
nothing
good
enough
for
her
in
the
whole
shop
there
was
not
a
shelf
that
she
did
ransack
to
find
the
finery
and
frippery
that
glittered
most
and
in
the
evening
when
the
others
had
lain
them
down
to
rest
she
strolled
over
to
the
storehouse
with
a
light
but
kjel
who
was
a
very
light
sleeper
was
up
and
after
her
in
an
instant
and
peeped
at
her
through
the
crack
in
the
door
there
he
saw
her
cutting
up
the
victuals
and
putting
one
aside
after
the
other
and
and
bacon
and
into
the
large
chest
which
she
had
hidden
behind
the
herring
barrels
and
on
this
the
last
evening
before
their
departure
for
bergen
she
had
filled
her
so
full
that
she
had
to
sit
upon
it
with
all
her
huge
heavy
weight
to
press
it
down
but
the
lock
would
catch
she
had
filled
the
chest
too
full
so
she
had
to
get
up
and
stamp
backwards
on
the
lid
till
it
regularly
thundered
and
sure
enough
she
forced
it
down
at
last
but
the
heel
she
stamped
down
upon
it
with
was
much
more
like
the
hoof
of
a
horse
than
the
foot
of
a
human
being
thought
kjel
then
she
carried
the
chest
to
the
waggon
that
it
might
be
smuggled
on
board
without
any
one
seeing
it
after
that
she
went
into
the
stable
and
unloosed
the
horse
but
then
there
was
a
pretty
to
do
in
the
stable
the
horse
knew
that
there
was
witchcraft
afoot
and
would
not
allow
itself
to
be
inspanned
toad
dragged
and
dragged
and
the
horse
shied
and
kicked
at
last
the
wench
used
her
just
as
a
mare
does
such
sport
as
that
no
human
eye
should
have
ever
seen
and
straight
off
to
the
general
dealer
rushed
kjel
and
got
him
to
come
out
with
him
there
in
the
moonshine
that
wench
toad
and
the
dun
horse
were
flinging
out
at
each
other
as
if
for
a
wager
so
that
their
hoofs
dashed
against
the
framework
of
the
their
long
legs
flew
in
turn
over
the
stable
walls
and
the
sparks
scattered
about
in
showers
then
the
general
dealer
grew
all
of
a
shiver
and
staggered
about
blood
flew
from
his
nose
and
kjel
had
to
help
him
into
the
kitchen
and
duck
his
head
in
the
sink
that
night
the
general
dealer
did
go
to
bed
at
all
but
he
walked
up
and
down
and
stamped
till
the
floor
regularly
thundered
and
it
was
scarcely
light
next
morning
when
he
sent
off
kjel
with
a
dollar
in
his
fist
to
old
thore
the
foreman
and
he
sent
in
the
same
way
to
all
the
boat
people
down
by
the
shore
thore
was
told
to
put
on
his
holiday
clothes
and
get
out
the
and
row
madame
herself
to
the
yacht
with
the
last
lading
she
should
go
with
him
to
bergen
there
she
should
get
both
a
silk
dress
and
a
shawl
and
a
gold
watch
and
chain
into
the
bargain
and
engage
a
bergen
it
was
still
early
in
the
day
when
the
yacht
lay
in
the
bay
with
her
flag
flying
all
ready
to
start
when
they
had
hoisted
the
sail
that
wench
toad
heavy
and
stout
came
puffing
and
blowing
across
the
bridge
in
full
parade
with
rings
on
all
her
sprawling
fingers
and
her
body
covered
with
all
the
yellow
and
green
and
red
ribbons
she
could
possibly
find
room
for
on
her
ample
person
there
she
stood
waiting
for
them
to
come
back
in
the
stately
and
take
her
on
board
and
when
they
began
to
raise
the
anchor
and
the
general
dealer
appeared
on
deck
with
his
large
meerschaum
pipe
and
his
telescope
she
smirked
and
minced
and
wriggled
and
twisted
and
cried
aloud
it
me
she
thought
he
wanted
to
peep
at
her
splendour
through
his
spyglass
all
at
once
she
saw
madame
standing
by
his
side
in
full
travelling
costume
and
understood
that
they
were
going
away
without
her
then
she
kicked
out
so
that
the
planks
of
the
bridge
groaned
and
creaked
beneath
her
eight
into
the
sea
she
plunged
and
caught
hold
of
the
anchor
and
tugged
and
held
the
ship
back
till
the
cable
broke
then
head
over
heels
she
went
with
both
her
hoofs
in
the
air
but
the
yacht
glided
away
under
full
sail
and
the
general
dealer
stood
there
and
laughed
till
he
nearly
fell
overboard
a
giantess
the
wife
of
the
mountain
gnome
who
rules
in
the
dovrefeld
the
general
dealer
wife
thin
