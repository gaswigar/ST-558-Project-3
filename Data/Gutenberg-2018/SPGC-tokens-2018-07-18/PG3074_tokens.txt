the
burgess
bird
book
for
children
by
thornton
burgess
to
the
children
and
the
birds
of
america
that
the
bonds
of
love
and
friendship
between
them
may
be
strengthened
this
book
is
dedicated
preface
this
book
was
written
to
supply
a
definite
need
its
preparation
was
undertaken
at
the
urgent
request
of
booksellers
and
others
who
have
felt
the
lack
of
a
satisfactory
medium
of
introduction
to
bird
life
for
little
children
as
such
and
in
no
sense
whatever
as
a
competitor
with
the
many
excellent
books
on
this
subject
but
rather
to
supplement
these
this
volume
has
been
written
its
primary
purpose
is
to
interest
the
little
child
in
and
to
make
him
acquainted
with
those
feathered
friends
he
is
most
likely
to
see
because
there
is
no
method
of
approach
to
the
child
mind
equal
to
the
story
this
method
of
conveying
information
has
been
adopted
so
far
as
i
am
aware
the
book
is
unique
in
this
respect
in
its
preparation
an
earnest
effort
has
been
made
to
present
as
far
as
possible
the
important
facts
regarding
the
appearance
habits
and
characteristics
of
our
feathered
neighbors
it
is
intended
to
be
at
once
a
story
book
and
an
authoritative
handbook
while
it
is
intended
for
little
children
it
is
hoped
that
children
of
larger
growth
may
find
in
it
much
of
both
interest
and
helpfulness
louis
agassiz
fuertes
artist
and
naturalist
has
marvelously
supplemented
such
value
as
may
be
in
the
text
by
his
wonderful
drawings
in
full
color
they
were
made
especially
for
this
volume
and
are
so
accurate
so
true
to
life
that
study
of
them
will
enable
any
one
to
identify
the
species
shown
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
fuertes
for
his
cooperation
in
the
endeavor
to
make
this
book
of
real
assistance
to
the
beginner
in
the
study
of
our
native
birds
it
is
offered
to
the
reader
without
apologies
of
any
sort
it
was
written
as
a
labor
of
love
love
for
little
children
and
love
for
the
birds
if
as
a
result
of
it
even
a
few
children
are
led
to
a
keener
interest
in
and
better
understanding
of
our
feathered
friends
its
purpose
will
have
been
accomplished

chapter
jenny
wren
arrives
scampered
peter
rabbit
behind
the
stone
wall
along
one
side
of
the
old
orchard
it
was
early
in
the
morning
very
early
in
the
morning
in
fact
jolly
bright
sun
had
hardly
begun
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
it
was
nothing
unusual
for
peter
to
see
jolly
sun
get
up
in
the
morning
it
would
be
more
unusual
for
peter
not
to
see
him
for
you
know
peter
is
a
great
hand
to
stay
out
all
night
and
not
go
back
to
the
dear
old
where
his
home
is
until
the
hour
when
most
folks
are
just
getting
out
of
bed
peter
had
been
out
all
night
this
time
but
he
was
sleepy
not
the
least
teeny
weeny
bit
you
see
sweet
mistress
spring
had
arrived
and
there
was
so
much
happening
on
every
side
and
peter
was
so
afraid
he
would
miss
something
that
he
would
have
slept
at
all
if
he
could
have
helped
it
peter
had
come
over
to
the
old
orchard
so
early
this
morning
to
see
if
there
had
been
any
new
arrivals
the
day
before
birds
are
funny
creatures
said
peter
as
he
hopped
over
a
low
place
in
the
old
stone
wall
and
was
fairly
in
the
old
orchard
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
cried
a
rather
sharp
scolding
voice
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
peter
rabbit
they
are
not
funny
creatures
at
all
they
are
the
most
sensible
folks
in
all
the
wide
peter
cut
a
long
hop
short
right
in
the
middle
to
sit
up
with
shining
eyes
oh
jenny
wren
i
so
glad
to
see
you
when
did
you
arrive
he
cried
mr
wren
and
i
have
just
arrived
and
thank
goodness
we
are
here
at
last
replied
jenny
wren
fussing
about
as
only
she
can
in
a
branch
above
peter
i
never
was
more
thankful
in
my
life
to
see
a
place
than
i
am
right
this
minute
to
see
the
old
orchard
once
more
it
seems
ages
and
ages
since
we
left
well
if
you
are
so
fond
of
it
what
did
you
leave
it
for
demanded
peter
it
is
just
as
i
said
before
you
birds
are
funny
creatures
you
never
stay
put
at
least
a
lot
of
you
do
sammy
jay
and
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
and
drummer
the
woodpecker
and
a
few
others
have
a
little
sense
they
do
go
off
on
long
foolish
journeys
but
the
rest
of
you
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
interrupted
jenny
wren
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
and
no
one
sounds
so
silly
as
one
who
tries
to
talk
about
something
he
knows
nothing
peter
chuckled
that
tongue
of
yours
is
just
as
sharp
as
ever
said
he
but
just
the
same
it
is
good
to
hear
it
we
certainly
would
miss
it
i
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
worried
for
fear
something
might
have
happened
to
you
so
that
you
would
be
back
here
this
summer
you
know
me
well
enough
jenny
wren
to
know
that
you
ca
hurt
me
with
your
tongue
sharp
as
it
is
so
you
may
as
well
save
your
breath
to
tell
me
a
few
things
i
want
to
know
now
if
you
are
as
fond
of
the
old
orchard
as
you
pretend
to
be
why
did
you
ever
leave
it
jenny
wren
bright
eyes
snapped
why
do
you
eat
she
asked
tartly
because
i
hungry
replied
peter
promptly
what
would
you
eat
if
there
were
nothing
to
eat
snapped
jenny
that
a
silly
question
retorted
peter
no
more
silly
than
asking
me
why
i
leave
the
old
orchard
replied
jenny
do
give
us
birds
credit
for
a
little
common
sense
peter
we
ca
live
without
eating
any
more
than
you
can
and
in
winter
there
is
no
food
at
all
here
for
most
of
us
so
we
go
where
there
is
food
those
who
are
lucky
enough
to
eat
the
kinds
of
food
that
can
be
found
here
in
winter
stay
here
they
are
lucky
that
what
they
are
lucky
still
jenny
wren
paused
still
what
prompted
peter
i
wonder
sometimes
if
you
folks
who
are
at
home
all
the
time
know
just
what
a
blessed
place
home
is
replied
jenny
it
is
only
six
months
since
we
went
south
but
i
said
it
seems
ages
and
it
does
the
best
part
of
going
away
is
coming
home
i
do
care
if
that
does
sound
rather
mixed
it
is
true
just
the
same
it
is
home
down
there
in
the
sunny
south
even
if
we
do
spend
as
much
time
there
as
we
do
here
this
is
home
and
there
no
place
like
it
what
that
wren
i
seen
all
the
great
world
perhaps
i
have
but
i
seen
enough
of
it
let
me
tell
you
that
anyone
who
travels
a
thousand
miles
twice
a
year
as
we
do
has
a
right
to
express
an
opinion
especially
if
they
have
used
their
eyes
as
i
have
mine
there
is
no
place
like
home
and
you
try
to
tease
me
by
pretending
that
there
is
my
dear
i
know
you
you
are
just
as
tickled
to
be
back
here
as
i
he
sings
as
if
he
were
said
peter
for
all
the
time
wren
was
singing
with
all
his
might
jenny
wren
looked
over
at
wren
fondly
is
he
a
dear
to
sing
to
me
like
that
and
is
it
a
perfectly
beautiful
spring
song
said
she
then
without
waiting
for
peter
to
reply
her
tongue
rattled
on
i
do
wish
he
would
be
careful
sometimes
i
am
afraid
he
will
overdo
just
look
at
him
now
he
is
singing
so
hard
that
he
is
shaking
all
over
he
always
is
that
way
there
is
one
thing
true
about
us
wrens
and
this
is
that
when
we
do
things
we
do
them
with
all
our
might
when
we
work
we
work
with
all
our
might
when
wren
sings
he
sings
with
all
his
and
when
you
scold
you
scold
with
all
your
might
interrupted
peter
mischievously
jenny
wren
opened
her
mouth
for
a
sharp
reply
but
laughed
instead
i
suppose
i
do
scold
a
good
deal
said
she
but
if
i
did
goodness
knows
who
would
impose
on
us
i
ca
bear
to
be
imposed
did
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
up
from
the
sunny
south
asked
peter
fairly
pleasant
replied
jenny
we
took
it
rather
easily
some
birds
hurry
right
through
without
stopping
but
i
should
think
they
would
be
tired
to
death
when
they
arrive
we
rest
whenever
we
are
tired
and
just
follow
along
behind
mistress
spring
keeping
far
enough
behind
so
that
if
she
has
to
turn
back
we
will
not
get
caught
by
jack
frost
it
gives
us
time
to
get
our
new
suits
on
the
way
you
know
everybody
expects
you
to
have
new
things
when
you
return
home
how
do
you
like
my
new
suit
peter
jenny
bobbed
and
twisted
and
turned
to
show
it
off
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
was
very
proud
of
it
very
much
replied
peter
i
am
very
fond
of
brown
brown
and
gray
are
my
favorite
you
know
peter
own
coat
is
brown
and
gray
that
is
one
of
the
most
sensible
things
i
have
heard
you
say
chattered
jenny
wren
the
more
i
see
of
bright
colors
the
better
i
like
brown
it
always
is
in
good
taste
it
goes
well
with
almost
everything
it
is
neat
and
it
is
useful
if
there
is
need
of
getting
out
of
sight
in
a
hurry
you
can
do
it
if
you
wear
brown
but
if
you
wear
bright
colors
it
is
so
easy
i
never
envy
anybody
who
happens
to
have
brighter
clothes
than
mine
i
seen
dreadful
things
happen
all
because
of
wearing
bright
what
demanded
peter
i
rather
not
talk
about
them
declared
jenny
in
a
very
emphatic
way
down
where
we
spent
the
winter
some
of
the
feathered
folks
who
live
there
all
the
year
round
wear
the
brightest
and
most
beautiful
suits
i
ever
seen
they
are
simply
gorgeous
but
i
noticed
that
in
times
of
danger
these
are
the
folks
dreadful
things
happen
to
you
see
they
simply
ca
get
out
of
sight
for
my
part
i
would
far
rather
be
simply
and
neatly
dressed
and
feel
safe
than
to
wear
wonderful
clothes
and
never
know
a
minute
peace
why
there
are
some
families
i
know
of
which
because
of
their
beautiful
suits
have
been
so
hunted
by
men
that
hardly
any
are
left
but
gracious
peter
rabbit
i
ca
sit
here
all
day
talking
to
you
i
must
find
out
who
else
has
arrived
in
the
old
orchard
and
must
look
my
old
house
over
to
see
if
it
is
fit
to
live
chapter
ii
the
old
orchard
bully
peter
rabbit
eyes
twinkled
when
jenny
wren
said
that
she
must
look
her
old
house
over
to
see
if
it
was
fit
to
live
in
i
can
save
you
that
trouble
said
he
what
do
you
mean
jenny
voice
was
very
sharp
only
that
our
old
house
is
already
occupied
replied
peter
bully
the
english
sparrow
has
been
living
in
it
for
the
last
two
months
in
fact
he
already
has
a
family
what
screamed
jenny
and
wren
together
then
without
even
saying
to
peter
they
flew
in
a
great
rage
to
see
if
he
had
told
them
the
truth
presently
he
heard
them
scolding
as
fast
as
their
tongues
could
go
and
this
is
very
fast
indeed
much
good
that
will
do
them
chuckled
peter
they
will
have
to
find
a
new
house
this
year
all
the
sharp
tongues
in
the
world
could
budge
bully
the
english
sparrow
my
my
my
my
just
hear
that
racket
i
think
i
go
over
and
see
what
is
going
so
peter
hopped
to
a
place
where
he
could
get
a
good
view
of
jenny
wren
old
home
and
still
not
be
too
far
from
the
safety
of
the
old
stone
wall
jenny
wren
old
home
had
been
in
a
hole
in
one
of
the
old
looking
over
to
it
peter
could
see
bully
sitting
in
the
little
round
doorway
and
quite
filling
it
she
was
shrieking
excitedly
hopping
and
flitting
from
twig
to
twig
close
by
were
jenny
and
wren
their
tails
pointing
almost
straight
up
to
the
sky
and
scolding
as
fast
as
they
could
make
their
tongues
go
flying
savagely
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
and
almost
drowning
their
voices
with
his
own
harsh
cries
was
bully
himself
he
was
perhaps
one
fourth
larger
than
wren
although
he
looked
half
again
as
big
but
for
the
fact
that
his
new
spring
suit
was
very
dirty
due
to
his
fondness
for
taking
dust
baths
and
the
fact
that
he
cares
nothing
about
his
personal
appearance
and
takes
no
care
of
himself
he
would
have
been
a
fairly
fellow
his
back
was
more
or
less
of
an
ashy
color
with
black
and
chestnut
stripes
his
wings
were
brown
with
a
white
bar
on
each
his
throat
and
breast
were
black
and
below
that
he
was
of
a
dirty
white
the
sides
of
his
throat
were
white
and
the
back
of
his
neck
chestnut
by
ruffling
up
his
feathers
and
raising
his
wings
slightly
as
he
hopped
about
he
managed
to
make
himself
appear
much
bigger
than
he
really
was
he
looked
like
a
regular
little
fighting
savage
the
noise
had
brought
all
the
other
birds
in
the
old
orchard
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
every
one
of
them
was
screaming
and
urging
jenny
and
wren
to
stand
up
for
their
rights
not
one
of
them
had
a
good
word
for
bully
and
his
wife
it
certainly
was
a
disgraceful
neighborhood
squabble
bully
the
english
sparrow
is
a
born
fighter
he
never
is
happier
than
when
he
is
in
the
midst
of
a
fight
or
a
fuss
of
some
kind
the
fact
that
all
his
neighbors
were
against
him
did
bother
bully
in
the
least
jenny
and
wren
are
no
cowards
but
the
two
together
were
no
match
for
bully
in
fact
bully
did
not
hesitate
to
fly
fiercely
at
any
of
the
onlookers
who
came
near
enough
not
even
when
they
were
twice
his
own
size
they
could
have
driven
him
from
the
old
orchard
had
they
set
out
to
but
just
by
his
boldness
and
appearance
he
made
them
afraid
to
try
all
the
time
bully
sat
in
the
little
round
doorway
encouraging
him
she
knew
that
as
long
as
she
sat
there
it
would
be
impossible
for
either
jenny
or
wren
to
get
in
truth
to
tell
she
was
enjoying
it
all
for
she
is
as
quarrelsome
and
as
fond
of
fighting
as
is
bully
himself
you
a
sneak
you
a
robber
that
my
house
and
the
sooner
you
get
out
of
it
the
better
shrieked
jenny
wren
jerking
her
tail
with
every
word
as
she
hopped
about
just
out
of
reach
of
bully
it
may
have
been
your
house
once
but
it
is
mine
now
you
little
cried
bully
rushing
at
her
like
a
little
fury
just
try
to
put
us
out
if
you
dare
you
did
make
this
house
in
the
first
place
and
you
deserted
it
when
you
went
south
last
fall
it
mine
now
and
there
is
anybody
in
the
old
orchard
who
can
put
me
peter
rabbit
nodded
he
right
there
muttered
peter
i
do
like
him
and
never
will
but
it
is
true
that
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
that
house
people
who
go
off
and
leave
things
for
half
a
year
expect
to
find
them
just
as
they
left
them
my
my
my
what
a
dreadful
noise
why
do
they
all
get
together
and
drive
bully
and
bully
out
of
the
old
orchard
if
they
do
i
afraid
he
will
drive
them
out
no
one
likes
to
live
with
such
quarrelsome
neighbors
they
do
belong
over
in
this
country
anyway
and
we
would
be
a
lot
better
off
if
they
were
not
here
but
i
must
say
i
do
have
to
admire
their
all
the
time
bully
was
darting
savagely
at
this
one
and
that
one
and
having
a
thoroughly
good
time
which
is
more
than
could
be
said
of
any
one
else
except
bully
i
teach
you
folks
to
know
that
i
am
in
the
old
orchard
to
stay
shrieked
bully
if
you
do
like
it
why
do
you
fight
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
of
you
or
all
of
you
this
was
boasting
plain
boasting
but
it
was
effective
he
actually
made
the
other
birds
believe
it
not
one
of
them
dared
stand
up
to
him
and
fight
they
were
content
to
call
him
a
bully
and
all
the
bad
names
they
could
think
of
but
that
did
nothing
to
help
jenny
and
wren
recover
their
house
calling
another
bad
names
never
hurts
him
brave
deeds
and
not
brave
words
are
what
count
how
long
that
disgraceful
squabble
in
the
old
orchard
would
have
lasted
had
it
not
been
for
something
which
happened
no
one
knows
right
in
the
midst
of
it
some
one
discovered
black
pussy
the
cat
who
lives
in
farmer
brown
house
stealing
up
through
the
old
orchard
her
tail
twitching
and
her
yellow
eyes
glaring
eagerly
she
had
heard
that
dreadful
racket
and
suspected
that
in
the
midst
of
such
excitement
she
might
have
a
chance
to
catch
one
of
the
feathered
folks
you
can
always
trust
black
pussy
to
be
on
hand
at
a
time
like
that
no
sooner
was
she
discovered
than
everything
else
was
forgotten
with
bully
in
the
lead
and
jenny
and
wren
close
behind
him
all
the
birds
turned
their
attention
to
black
pussy
she
was
the
enemy
of
all
and
they
straightway
forgot
their
own
quarrel
only
bully
remained
where
she
was
in
the
little
round
doorway
of
her
house
she
intended
to
take
no
chances
but
she
added
her
voice
to
the
general
racket
how
those
birds
did
shriek
and
scream
they
darted
down
almost
into
the
face
of
black
pussy
and
none
went
nearer
than
bully
the
english
sparrow
and
jenny
wren
now
black
pussy
hates
to
be
the
center
of
so
much
attention
she
knew
that
now
she
had
been
discovered
there
was
a
chance
in
the
world
for
her
to
catch
one
of
those
old
orchard
folks
so
with
tail
still
twitching
angrily
she
turned
and
with
such
dignity
as
she
could
left
the
old
orchard
clear
to
the
edge
of
it
the
birds
followed
shrieking
screaming
calling
her
bad
names
and
threatening
to
do
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
to
her
quite
as
if
they
really
could
when
finally
she
disappeared
towards
farmer
brown
barn
those
angry
voices
changed
it
was
such
a
funny
change
that
peter
rabbit
laughed
right
out
instead
of
anger
there
was
triumph
in
every
note
as
everybody
returned
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
jenny
and
wren
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
bully
and
his
wife
in
their
old
house
they
flew
to
another
part
of
the
old
orchard
there
to
talk
it
all
over
and
rest
and
get
their
breath
peter
rabbit
waited
to
see
if
they
would
not
come
over
near
enough
to
him
for
a
little
more
gossip
but
they
did
and
finally
peter
started
for
his
home
in
the
dear
old
all
the
way
there
he
chuckled
as
he
thought
of
the
spunky
way
in
which
jenny
and
wren
had
stood
up
for
their
rights
chapter
iii
jenny
has
a
good
word
for
some
sparrows
the
morning
after
the
fight
between
jenny
and
wren
and
bully
the
english
sparrow
found
peter
rabbit
in
the
old
orchard
again
he
was
so
curious
to
know
what
jenny
wren
would
do
for
a
house
that
nothing
but
some
very
great
danger
could
have
kept
him
away
from
there
truth
to
tell
peter
was
afraid
that
not
being
able
to
have
their
old
house
jenny
and
wren
would
decide
to
leave
the
old
orchard
altogether
so
it
was
with
a
great
deal
of
relief
that
as
he
hopped
over
a
low
place
in
the
old
stone
wall
he
heard
wren
singing
with
all
his
might
the
song
was
coming
from
quite
the
other
side
of
the
old
orchard
from
where
bully
and
bully
had
set
up
housekeeping
peter
hurried
over
he
found
wren
right
away
but
at
first
saw
nothing
of
jenny
he
was
just
about
to
ask
after
her
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
with
a
tiny
stick
in
her
bill
she
snapped
her
sharp
little
eyes
at
him
but
for
once
her
tongue
was
still
you
see
she
could
talk
and
carry
that
stick
at
the
same
time
peter
watched
her
and
saw
her
disappear
in
a
little
hole
in
a
big
branch
of
one
of
the
old
hardly
had
she
popped
in
than
she
popped
out
again
this
time
her
mouth
was
free
and
so
was
her
tongue
you
better
stop
singing
and
help
me
she
said
to
wren
sharply
wren
obediently
stopped
singing
and
began
to
hunt
for
a
tiny
little
twig
such
as
jenny
had
taken
into
that
hole
well
exclaimed
peter
it
did
take
you
long
to
find
a
new
house
did
it
certainly
not
snapped
jenny
we
ca
afford
to
sit
around
wasting
time
like
some
folk
i
peter
grinned
and
looked
a
little
foolish
but
he
did
resent
it
you
see
he
was
quite
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
are
you
afraid
that
bully
will
try
to
drive
you
out
of
that
house
he
ventured
jenny
wren
sharp
little
eyes
snapped
more
than
ever
i
like
to
see
him
try
said
she
that
doorway
too
small
for
him
to
get
more
than
his
head
in
and
if
he
tries
putting
his
head
in
while
i
inside
peck
his
eyes
out
she
said
this
so
fiercely
that
peter
laughed
right
out
i
really
believe
you
would
said
he
i
certainly
would
she
retorted
now
i
ca
stop
to
talk
to
you
peter
rabbit
because
i
too
busy
wren
you
ought
to
know
that
that
stick
is
too
jenny
snatched
it
out
of
wren
mouth
and
dropped
it
on
the
ground
while
wren
meekly
went
to
hunt
for
another
jenny
joined
him
and
as
peter
watched
them
he
understood
why
jenny
is
so
often
spoken
of
as
a
feathered
busybody
for
some
time
peter
rabbit
watched
jenny
and
wren
carry
sticks
and
straws
into
that
little
hole
until
it
seemed
to
him
they
were
trying
to
fill
the
whole
inside
of
the
tree
just
watching
them
made
peter
positively
tired
wren
would
stop
every
now
and
then
to
sing
but
jenny
did
waste
a
minute
in
spite
of
that
she
managed
to
talk
just
the
same
i
suppose
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
got
here
some
time
ago
said
she
peter
nodded
yes
said
he
i
saw
him
only
a
day
or
two
ago
over
by
the
laughing
brook
and
although
he
would
say
so
i
sure
that
he
has
a
nest
and
eggs
jenny
wren
jerked
her
tail
and
nodded
her
head
vigorously
i
suppose
so
said
she
he
does
have
to
make
as
long
a
journey
as
we
do
so
he
gets
here
sooner
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
such
a
difference
as
there
is
between
little
friend
and
his
cousin
bully
everybody
loves
little
once
more
peter
nodded
that
right
said
he
everybody
does
love
little
friend
it
makes
me
feel
sort
of
all
glad
inside
just
to
hear
him
sing
i
guess
it
makes
everybody
feel
that
way
i
wonder
why
we
so
seldom
see
him
up
here
in
the
old
because
he
likes
damp
places
with
plenty
of
bushes
better
replied
jenny
wren
it
would
do
for
everybody
to
like
the
same
kind
of
a
place
he
is
a
tree
bird
anyway
he
likes
to
be
on
or
near
the
ground
you
will
never
find
his
nest
much
above
the
ground
not
more
than
a
foot
or
two
quite
often
it
is
on
the
ground
of
course
i
prefer
wren
song
but
i
must
admit
that
little
friend
has
one
of
the
happiest
songs
of
any
one
i
know
then
too
he
is
so
modest
just
like
us
peter
turned
his
head
aside
to
hide
a
smile
for
if
there
is
anybody
who
delights
in
being
both
seen
and
heard
it
is
jenny
wren
while
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
is
shy
and
retiring
content
to
make
all
the
world
glad
with
his
song
but
preferring
to
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
jenny
chattered
on
as
she
hunted
for
some
more
material
for
her
nest
i
suppose
you
noticed
said
she
that
he
and
his
wife
dress
very
much
alike
they
do
go
in
for
bright
colors
any
more
than
we
wrens
do
they
show
good
taste
i
like
the
little
brown
caps
they
wear
and
the
way
their
breasts
and
sides
are
streaked
with
brown
then
too
they
are
such
useful
folks
it
is
a
pity
that
that
nuisance
of
a
bully
learn
something
from
them
i
suppose
they
stay
rather
later
than
we
do
in
the
yes
replied
peter
they
do
go
until
jack
frost
makes
them
i
do
know
of
any
one
that
we
miss
more
than
we
do
speaking
of
the
sparrow
family
did
you
see
anything
of
whitethroat
asked
jenny
wren
as
she
rested
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
of
her
new
house
and
looked
down
at
peter
rabbit
peter
face
brightened
i
should
say
i
did
he
exclaimed
he
stopped
for
a
few
days
on
his
way
north
i
only
wish
he
would
stay
here
all
the
time
but
he
seems
to
think
there
is
no
place
like
the
great
woods
of
the
north
i
could
listen
all
day
to
his
song
do
you
know
what
he
always
seems
to
be
saying
what
demanded
jenny
i
live
replied
peter
i
guess
he
must
too
because
he
makes
other
people
so
jenny
nodded
in
her
usual
emphatic
way
i
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
some
of
the
others
said
she
but
when
i
have
seen
him
down
in
the
south
he
always
has
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
perfect
gentleman
he
is
social
too
he
likes
to
travel
with
i
noticed
that
said
peter
he
almost
always
has
company
when
he
passes
through
here
some
of
those
sparrows
are
so
much
alike
that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
tell
them
apart
but
i
can
always
tell
whitethroat
because
he
is
one
of
the
largest
of
the
tribe
and
has
such
a
lovely
white
throat
he
really
is
handsome
with
his
black
and
white
cap
and
that
bright
yellow
spot
before
each
eye
i
am
told
that
he
is
very
dearly
loved
up
in
the
north
where
he
makes
his
home
they
say
he
sings
all
the
i
suppose
scratcher
the
fox
sparrow
has
been
along
too
said
jenny
he
also
started
sometime
before
we
yes
replied
peter
he
spent
one
night
in
the
dear
old
he
is
fine
looking
too
the
biggest
of
all
the
sparrow
tribe
and
how
he
can
sing
the
only
thing
i
got
against
him
is
the
color
of
his
coat
it
always
reminds
me
of
reddy
fox
and
i
do
like
anything
that
reminds
me
of
that
fellow
when
he
visited
us
i
discovered
something
about
scratcher
which
i
do
believe
you
what
demanded
jenny
rather
sharply
that
when
he
scratches
among
the
leaves
he
uses
both
feet
at
once
cried
peter
triumphantly
it
funny
to
watch
pooh
i
knew
that
retorted
jenny
wren
what
do
you
suppose
my
eyes
are
make
for
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
me
something
i
peter
looked
disappointed
chapter
iv
chippy
sweetvoice
and
dotty
for
a
while
jenny
wren
was
too
busy
to
talk
save
to
scold
wren
for
spending
so
much
time
singing
instead
of
working
to
peter
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
trying
to
fill
that
tree
trunk
with
rubbish
i
should
think
they
had
enough
stuff
in
there
for
half
a
dozen
nests
muttered
peter
i
do
believe
they
are
carrying
it
in
for
the
fun
of
peter
was
far
wrong
in
this
thought
as
he
was
to
discover
a
little
later
in
the
season
when
he
found
wren
building
another
nest
for
which
he
had
no
use
finding
that
for
the
time
being
he
could
get
nothing
more
from
jenny
wren
peter
hopped
over
to
visit
johnny
chuck
whose
home
was
between
the
roots
of
an
old
in
the
far
corner
of
the
old
orchard
peter
was
still
thinking
of
the
sparrow
family
what
a
big
family
it
was
yet
how
seldom
any
of
them
excepting
bully
the
english
sparrow
were
to
be
found
in
the
old
orchard
hello
johnny
chuck
cried
peter
as
he
discovered
johnny
sitting
on
his
doorstep
you
lived
in
the
old
orchard
a
long
time
so
you
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
something
i
want
to
know
why
is
it
that
none
of
the
sparrow
family
excepting
that
noisy
nuisance
bully
build
in
the
trees
of
the
old
orchard
is
it
because
bully
has
driven
all
the
rest
out
johnny
chuck
shook
his
head
peter
said
he
whatever
is
the
matter
with
your
ears
and
whatever
is
the
matter
with
your
eyes
nothing
replied
peter
rather
shortly
they
are
as
good
as
yours
any
day
johnny
johnny
grinned
listen
said
johnny
peter
listened
from
a
tree
just
a
little
way
off
came
a
clear
chip
chip
chip
peter
need
to
be
told
to
look
he
knew
without
looking
who
was
over
there
he
knew
that
voice
for
that
of
one
of
his
oldest
and
best
friends
in
the
old
orchard
a
little
fellow
with
a
cap
brown
back
with
feathers
streaked
with
black
brownish
wings
and
tail
a
gray
waistcoat
and
black
bill
and
a
little
white
line
over
each
eye
altogether
as
trim
a
little
gentleman
as
peter
was
acquainted
with
it
was
chippy
as
everybody
calls
the
chipping
sparrow
the
smallest
of
the
family
peter
looked
a
little
foolish
i
forgot
all
about
chippy
said
he
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
found
chippy
here
in
the
old
orchard
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
never
have
seen
his
nest
because
i
never
happened
to
think
about
looking
for
it
does
he
build
a
trashy
nest
like
his
cousin
bully
johnny
chuck
laughed
i
should
say
not
he
exclaimed
twice
chippy
and
chippy
have
built
their
nest
in
this
very
old
there
is
no
trash
in
their
nest
i
can
tell
you
it
is
just
as
dainty
as
they
are
and
not
a
bit
bigger
than
it
has
to
be
it
is
made
mostly
of
little
fine
dry
roots
and
it
is
lined
inside
with
what
that
peter
voice
sounded
as
it
he
suspected
that
johnny
chuck
was
trying
to
fool
him
it
a
fact
said
johnny
nodding
his
head
gravely
goodness
knows
where
they
find
it
these
days
but
find
it
they
do
here
comes
chippy
himself
ask
chippy
and
chippy
came
flitting
from
tree
to
tree
until
they
were
on
a
branch
right
over
peter
and
johnny
hello
cried
peter
you
folks
seem
very
busy
have
you
finished
building
your
nest
yet
nearly
replied
chippy
it
is
all
done
but
the
horsehair
we
are
on
our
way
up
to
farmer
brown
barnyard
now
to
look
for
some
you
seen
any
around
anywhere
have
you
peter
and
johnny
shook
their
heads
and
peter
confessed
that
he
know
horsehair
if
he
saw
it
he
often
had
found
hair
from
the
coats
of
reddy
fox
and
old
man
coyote
and
digger
the
badger
and
lightfoot
the
deer
but
hair
from
the
coat
of
a
horse
was
altogether
another
matter
it
is
hair
from
the
coat
of
a
horse
that
we
want
cried
chippy
as
he
prepared
to
fly
after
chippy
it
is
long
hair
form
the
tail
or
mane
of
a
horse
that
we
must
have
it
makes
the
very
nicest
kind
of
lining
for
a
chippy
and
chippy
were
gone
a
long
time
but
when
they
did
return
each
was
carrying
a
long
black
hair
they
had
found
what
they
wanted
and
chippy
was
in
high
spirits
because
as
she
took
pains
to
explain
to
peter
that
little
nest
would
not
soon
be
ready
for
the
four
beautiful
little
blue
eggs
with
black
spots
on
one
end
she
meant
to
lay
in
it
i
just
love
chippy
and
chippy
said
peter
as
they
watched
their
two
little
feathered
friends
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
little
nest
far
out
on
a
branch
of
one
of
the
everybody
does
replied
johnny
everybody
loves
them
as
much
as
they
hate
bully
and
his
wife
did
you
know
that
they
are
sometimes
called
tree
sparrows
i
suppose
it
is
because
they
so
often
build
their
nests
in
trees
no
said
peter
i
did
chippy
should
be
called
tree
sparrow
because
he
has
a
cousin
by
that
johnny
chuck
looked
as
if
he
doubted
that
i
never
heard
of
him
he
grunted
peter
grinned
here
was
a
chance
to
tell
johnny
chuck
something
and
peter
never
is
happier
than
when
he
can
tell
folks
something
they
know
you
know
him
if
you
did
sleep
all
winter
said
peter
dotty
the
tree
sparrow
spends
the
winter
here
he
left
for
his
home
in
the
far
north
about
the
time
you
took
it
into
your
head
to
wake
why
do
you
call
him
dotty
asked
johnny
chuck
because
he
has
a
little
round
black
dot
right
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
replied
peter
i
do
know
why
they
call
him
tree
sparrow
he
does
spend
his
time
in
the
trees
the
way
chippy
does
but
i
see
him
much
oftener
in
low
bushes
or
on
the
ground
i
think
chippy
has
much
more
right
to
the
name
of
tree
sparrow
than
dotty
has
now
i
think
of
it
i
heard
dotty
called
the
winter
gracious
what
a
exclaimed
johnny
chuck
with
chippy
being
called
a
tree
sparrow
and
a
tree
sparrow
called
chippy
i
should
think
folks
would
get
all
tangled
perhaps
they
would
replied
peter
if
both
were
here
at
the
same
time
but
chippy
comes
just
as
dotty
goes
and
dotty
comes
as
chippy
goes
that
a
pretty
good
arrangement
especially
as
they
look
very
much
alike
excepting
that
dotty
is
quite
a
little
bigger
than
chippy
and
always
has
that
black
dot
which
chippy
does
not
have
goodness
gracious
it
is
time
i
was
back
in
the
dear
old
johnny
away
went
peter
rabbit
heading
for
the
dear
old
out
of
the
grass
just
ahead
of
him
flew
a
rather
pale
streaked
little
brown
bird
and
as
he
spread
his
tail
peter
saw
two
white
feathers
on
the
outer
edges
those
two
white
feathers
were
all
peter
needed
to
recognize
another
little
friend
of
whom
he
is
very
fond
it
was
sweetvoice
the
vesper
sparrow
the
only
one
of
the
sparrow
family
with
white
feathers
in
his
tail
come
over
to
the
dear
old
and
sing
to
me
cried
peter
sweetvoice
dropped
down
into
the
grass
again
and
when
peter
came
up
was
very
busy
getting
a
mouthful
of
dry
grass
ca
mumbled
sweetvoice
ca
do
it
now
peter
rabbit
i
too
busy
it
is
high
time
our
nest
was
finished
and
sweetvoice
will
lose
her
patience
if
i
do
get
this
grass
over
there
pretty
where
is
your
nest
in
a
tree
asked
peter
innocently
that
telling
declared
sweetvoice
not
a
living
soul
knows
where
that
nest
is
excepting
sweetvoice
and
myself
this
much
i
will
tell
you
peter
it
is
in
a
tree
and
i
tell
you
this
much
more
it
is
in
a
hoofprint
of
bossy
the
in
a
what
cried
peter
in
a
hoofprint
of
bossy
the
cow
repeated
sweetvoice
chuckling
softly
you
know
when
the
ground
was
wet
and
soft
early
this
spring
bossy
left
deep
footprints
wherever
she
went
one
of
these
makes
the
nicest
kind
of
a
place
for
a
nest
i
think
we
have
picked
out
the
very
best
one
on
all
the
green
meadows
now
run
along
peter
rabbit
and
do
bother
me
any
more
i
got
too
much
to
do
to
sit
here
talking
perhaps
i
come
over
to
the
edge
of
the
dear
old
and
sing
to
you
a
while
just
after
jolly
round
red
sun
goes
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
i
just
love
to
sing
i
be
watching
for
you
replied
peter
you
do
love
to
sing
any
better
than
i
love
to
hear
you
i
think
that
is
the
best
time
of
all
the
day
in
which
to
sing
i
mean
i
think
it
the
best
time
to
hear
singing
for
of
course
peter
himself
does
not
sing
at
all
that
night
sure
enough
just
as
the
black
shadows
came
creeping
out
over
the
green
meadows
sweetvoice
perched
on
the
top
of
a
over
peter
head
sang
over
and
over
again
the
sweetest
little
song
and
kept
on
singing
even
after
it
was
quite
dark
peter
did
know
it
but
it
is
this
habit
of
singing
in
the
evening
which
has
given
sweetvoice
his
name
of
vesper
sparrow
chapter
peter
learns
something
he
had
guessed
running
over
to
the
old
orchard
very
early
in
the
morning
for
a
little
gossip
with
jenny
wren
and
his
other
friends
there
had
become
a
regular
thing
with
peter
rabbit
he
was
learning
a
great
many
things
and
some
of
them
were
most
surprising
now
two
of
peter
oldest
and
best
friends
in
the
old
orchard
were
winsome
bluebird
and
welcome
robin
every
spring
they
arrived
pretty
nearly
together
though
winsome
bluebird
usually
was
a
few
days
ahead
of
welcome
robin
this
year
winsome
had
arrived
while
the
snow
still
lingered
in
patches
he
was
as
he
always
is
the
herald
of
sweet
mistress
spring
and
when
peter
had
heard
for
the
first
time
soft
sweet
whistle
which
seemed
to
come
from
nowhere
in
particular
and
from
everywhere
in
general
he
had
kicked
up
his
long
hind
legs
from
pure
joy
then
when
a
few
days
later
he
had
heard
welcome
joyous
message
of
cheer
from
the
tiptop
of
a
tall
tree
he
had
known
that
mistress
spring
really
had
arrived
peter
loves
winsome
bluebird
and
welcome
robin
just
as
everybody
else
does
and
he
had
known
them
so
long
and
so
well
that
he
thought
he
knew
all
there
was
to
know
about
them
he
would
have
been
very
indignant
had
anybody
told
him
he
did
those
cousins
do
look
much
alike
do
they
remarked
jenny
wren
as
she
poked
her
head
out
of
her
house
to
gossip
with
peter
what
cousins
demanded
peter
staring
very
hard
in
the
direction
in
which
jenny
wren
was
looking
those
two
sitting
on
the
fence
over
there
where
are
your
eyes
peter
replied
jenny
rather
sharply
peter
stared
harder
than
ever
on
one
post
sat
winsome
bluebird
and
on
another
post
sat
welcome
robin
i
do
see
anybody
but
winsome
and
welcome
and
they
are
not
even
related
replied
peter
with
a
little
puzzled
frown
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
peter
exclaimed
jenny
wren
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
who
told
you
any
such
nonsense
as
that
of
course
they
are
related
they
are
cousins
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
they
belong
to
the
same
family
that
melody
the
thrush
and
all
the
other
thrushes
belong
to
that
makes
them
all
what
exclaimed
peter
looking
as
if
he
did
believe
a
word
of
what
jenny
wren
had
said
jenny
repeated
and
still
peter
looked
doubtful
then
jenny
lost
her
temper
a
thing
she
does
very
easily
if
you
believe
me
go
ask
one
of
them
she
snapped
and
disappeared
inside
her
house
where
peter
could
hear
her
scolding
away
to
herself
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
this
struck
peter
as
good
advice
so
he
hopped
over
to
the
foot
of
the
fence
post
on
which
winsome
bluebird
was
sitting
jenny
wren
says
that
you
and
welcome
robin
are
cousins
she
does
know
what
she
is
talking
about
does
she
asked
peter
winsome
chuckled
it
was
a
soft
gentle
chuckle
yes
said
he
nodding
his
head
we
are
you
can
trust
that
little
busybody
to
know
what
she
is
talking
about
every
time
i
sometimes
think
she
knows
more
about
other
people
affairs
than
about
her
own
welcome
and
i
may
not
look
much
alike
but
we
are
cousins
just
the
same
do
you
think
welcome
is
looking
unusually
fine
this
spring
not
a
bit
finer
than
you
are
yourself
winsome
replied
peter
politely
i
just
love
that
coat
of
yours
what
is
the
reason
that
bluebird
does
wear
as
bright
a
coat
as
you
do
go
ask
jenny
wren
chuckled
winsome
bluebird
and
before
peter
could
say
another
word
he
flew
over
to
the
roof
of
farmer
brown
house
back
scampered
peter
to
tell
jenny
wren
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
doubted
her
and
that
he
never
would
again
then
he
begged
jenny
to
tell
him
why
it
was
that
bluebird
was
not
as
brightly
dressed
as
was
winsome
mrs
bluebird
like
most
mothers
is
altogether
too
busy
to
spend
much
time
taking
care
of
her
clothes
and
fine
clothes
need
a
lot
of
care
replied
jenny
besides
when
winsome
is
about
he
attracts
all
the
attention
and
that
gives
her
a
chance
to
slip
in
and
out
of
her
nest
without
being
noticed
i
do
believe
you
know
peter
rabbit
where
winsome
nest
peter
had
to
admit
that
he
did
although
he
had
tried
his
best
to
find
out
by
watching
winsome
i
think
it
over
in
that
little
house
put
up
by
farmer
brown
boy
he
ventured
i
saw
both
and
bluebird
go
in
it
when
they
first
came
and
i
seen
winsome
around
it
a
great
deal
since
so
i
guess
it
is
so
you
guess
it
is
there
mimicked
jenny
wren
well
your
guess
is
quite
wrong
peter
quite
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
in
one
of
those
old
fence
posts
but
just
which
one
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
i
will
leave
that
for
you
to
find
out
bluebird
certainly
shows
good
sense
she
knows
a
good
house
when
she
sees
it
the
hole
in
that
post
is
one
of
the
best
holes
anywhere
around
here
if
i
had
arrived
here
early
enough
i
would
have
taken
it
myself
but
bluebird
already
had
her
nest
built
in
it
and
four
eggs
there
so
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
come
here
just
between
you
and
me
peter
i
think
the
bluebirds
show
more
sense
in
nest
building
than
do
their
cousins
the
robins
there
is
nothing
like
a
house
with
stout
walls
and
a
doorway
just
big
enough
to
get
in
and
out
of
peter
nodded
quite
as
if
he
understood
all
about
the
advantages
of
a
house
with
walls
that
reminds
me
said
he
the
other
day
i
saw
welcome
robin
getting
mud
and
carrying
it
away
pretty
soon
he
was
joined
by
robin
and
she
did
the
same
thing
they
kept
it
up
till
i
got
tired
of
watching
them
what
were
they
doing
with
that
mud
building
their
nest
of
course
stupid
retorted
jenny
welcome
robin
with
that
black
head
beautiful
russet
breast
black
and
white
throat
and
yellow
bill
not
to
mention
the
proud
way
in
which
he
carries
himself
certainly
is
a
handsome
fellow
and
robin
is
only
a
little
less
handsome
how
they
can
be
content
to
build
the
kind
of
a
home
they
do
is
more
than
i
can
understand
people
think
that
wren
and
i
use
a
lot
of
trash
in
our
nest
perhaps
we
do
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
and
that
is
it
is
clean
trash
it
is
just
sticks
and
clean
straws
and
before
i
lay
my
eggs
i
see
to
it
that
my
nest
is
lined
with
feathers
more
than
this
there
is
any
cleaner
housekeeper
than
i
am
if
i
do
say
it
welcome
robin
is
a
fine
looker
and
a
fine
singer
and
everybody
loves
him
but
when
it
comes
to
housekeeping
he
and
robin
are
just
plain
dirty
they
make
the
foundation
of
their
nest
of
mud
plain
common
ordinary
mud
they
cover
this
with
dead
grass
and
sometimes
there
is
mighty
little
of
this
over
the
inside
walls
of
mud
i
know
because
seen
the
inside
of
their
nest
often
anybody
with
any
eyes
at
all
can
find
their
nest
more
than
once
i
known
them
to
have
their
nest
washed
away
in
a
heavy
rain
or
have
it
blown
down
in
a
high
wind
nothing
like
that
ever
happens
to
winsome
bluebird
or
to
jenny
disappeared
inside
her
house
and
peter
waited
for
her
to
come
out
again
welcome
robin
flew
down
on
the
ground
ran
a
few
steps
and
then
stood
still
with
his
head
on
one
side
as
if
listening
then
he
reached
down
and
tugged
at
something
and
presently
out
of
the
ground
came
a
long
wriggling
angleworm
welcome
gulped
it
down
and
ran
on
a
few
steps
then
once
more
paused
to
listen
this
time
he
turned
and
ran
three
or
four
steps
to
the
right
where
he
pulled
another
worm
out
of
the
ground
he
acts
as
if
he
heard
those
worms
in
the
ground
said
peter
speaking
aloud
without
thinking
he
does
said
jenny
wren
poking
her
head
out
of
her
doorway
just
as
peter
spoke
how
do
you
suppose
he
would
find
them
when
they
are
in
the
ground
if
he
did
hear
them
can
you
hear
them
asked
peter
i
never
tried
and
i
do
intend
to
waste
my
time
trying
retorted
jenny
welcome
robin
may
enjoy
eating
them
but
for
my
part
i
want
something
smaller
and
daintier
young
grasshoppers
tender
young
beetles
small
caterpillars
bugs
and
peter
had
to
turn
his
head
aside
to
hide
the
wry
face
he
just
had
to
make
at
the
mention
of
such
things
as
food
is
that
all
welcome
robin
eats
he
asked
innocently
i
should
say
not
laughed
jenny
he
eats
a
lot
of
other
kinds
of
worms
and
he
just
dearly
loves
fruit
like
strawberries
and
cherries
and
all
sorts
of
small
berries
well
i
ca
stop
here
talking
any
longer
i
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
peter
if
you
promise
not
to
of
course
peter
promised
and
jenny
leaned
so
far
down
that
peter
wondered
how
she
could
keep
from
falling
as
she
whispered
i
got
seven
eggs
in
my
nest
so
if
you
do
see
much
of
me
for
the
next
week
or
more
you
know
why
i
just
got
to
sit
on
those
eggs
and
keep
them
chapter
vi
an
old
friend
in
a
new
home
every
day
brought
newcomers
to
the
old
orchard
and
early
in
the
morning
there
were
so
many
voices
to
be
heard
that
perhaps
it
is
no
wonder
if
for
some
time
peter
rabbit
failed
to
miss
that
of
one
of
his
very
good
friends
most
unexpectedly
he
was
reminded
of
this
as
very
early
one
morning
he
scampered
across
a
little
bridge
over
the
laughing
brook
dear
me
dear
me
dear
me
cried
rather
a
plaintive
voice
peter
stopped
so
suddenly
that
he
all
but
fell
heels
over
head
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
tall
dead
mullein
stalk
was
a
very
soberly
dressed
but
rather
trim
little
fellow
a
very
little
larger
than
bully
the
english
sparrow
above
his
coat
was
of
a
dull
while
underneath
he
was
of
a
with
faint
tinges
of
yellow
in
places
his
head
was
dark
and
his
bill
black
the
feathers
on
his
head
were
lifted
just
enough
to
make
the
tiniest
kind
of
crest
his
wings
and
tail
were
dusky
little
bars
of
white
showing
very
faintly
on
his
wings
while
the
outer
edges
of
his
tail
were
distinctly
white
he
sat
with
his
tail
hanging
straight
down
as
if
he
had
strength
enough
to
hold
it
up
hello
dear
me
cried
peter
joyously
what
are
you
doing
way
down
here
i
have
seen
you
since
you
first
arrived
just
after
winsome
bluebird
got
peter
started
to
say
that
he
had
wondered
what
had
become
of
dear
me
but
checked
himself
for
peter
is
very
honest
and
he
realized
now
that
in
the
excitement
of
greeting
so
many
friends
he
had
missed
dear
me
at
all
dear
me
the
phoebe
did
not
reply
at
once
but
darted
out
into
the
air
and
peter
heard
a
sharp
click
of
that
little
black
bill
making
a
short
circle
dear
me
alighted
on
the
mullein
stalk
again
did
you
catch
a
fly
then
asked
peter
dear
me
dear
me
of
course
i
did
was
the
prompt
reply
and
with
each
word
there
was
a
jerk
of
that
long
hanging
tail
peter
almost
wondered
if
in
some
way
dear
me
tongue
and
tail
were
connected
i
suppose
said
he
that
it
is
the
habit
of
catching
flies
and
bugs
in
the
air
that
has
given
your
family
the
name
of
dear
me
nodded
and
almost
at
once
started
into
the
air
again
once
more
peter
heard
the
click
of
that
little
black
bill
then
dear
me
was
back
on
his
perch
peter
asked
again
what
he
was
doing
down
there
mrs
phoebe
and
i
are
living
down
here
replied
dear
me
we
made
our
home
down
here
and
we
like
it
very
peter
looked
all
around
this
way
that
way
every
way
with
the
funniest
expression
on
his
face
he
did
see
anything
of
phoebe
and
he
did
see
any
place
in
which
he
could
imagine
and
phoebe
building
a
nest
what
are
you
looking
for
asked
dear
me
for
phoebe
and
your
home
declared
peter
quite
frankly
i
suppose
you
and
phoebe
ever
built
a
nest
on
the
ground
and
i
see
any
other
place
around
here
for
dear
me
chuckled
i
would
tell
any
one
but
you
peter
said
he
but
i
known
you
so
long
that
i
going
to
let
you
into
a
little
secret
phoebe
and
our
home
are
under
the
very
bridge
you
are
sitting
i
do
believe
it
cried
peter
but
dear
me
knew
from
the
way
peter
said
it
that
he
really
did
mean
that
look
and
see
for
yourself
said
dear
me
so
peter
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
and
tried
to
stretch
his
head
over
the
edge
of
the
bridge
so
as
to
see
under
it
but
his
neck
was
long
enough
or
else
he
was
afraid
to
lean
over
as
far
as
he
might
have
finally
he
gave
up
and
at
phoebe
suggestion
crept
down
the
bank
to
the
very
edge
of
the
laughing
brook
dear
me
darted
out
to
catch
another
fly
then
flew
right
in
under
the
bridge
and
alighted
on
a
little
ledge
of
stone
just
beneath
the
floor
there
sure
enough
was
a
nest
and
peter
could
see
phoebe
bill
and
the
top
of
her
head
above
the
edge
of
it
it
was
a
nest
with
a
foundation
of
mud
covered
with
moss
and
lined
with
feathers
that
perfectly
splendid
cried
peter
as
dear
me
resumed
his
perch
on
the
old
mullein
stalk
how
did
you
ever
come
to
think
of
such
a
place
and
why
did
you
leave
the
shed
up
at
farmer
brown
where
you
have
build
your
home
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
oh
replied
dear
me
we
phoebes
always
have
been
fond
of
building
under
bridges
you
see
a
place
like
this
is
quite
safe
then
too
we
like
to
be
near
water
always
there
are
many
insects
flying
around
where
there
is
water
so
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
get
plenty
to
eat
i
left
the
shed
at
farmer
brown
because
that
pesky
cat
up
there
discovered
our
nest
last
year
and
we
had
a
dreadful
time
keeping
our
babies
out
of
her
clutches
she
has
found
us
down
here
and
she
would
be
able
to
trouble
us
if
she
should
find
i
suppose
said
peter
that
as
usual
you
were
the
first
of
your
family
to
certainly
of
course
replied
dear
me
we
always
are
the
first
phoebe
and
i
do
go
as
far
south
in
winter
as
the
other
members
of
the
family
do
they
go
clear
down
into
the
tropics
but
we
manage
to
pick
up
a
pretty
good
living
without
going
as
far
as
that
so
we
get
back
here
before
the
rest
of
them
and
usually
have
begun
housekeeping
by
the
time
they
arrive
my
cousin
chebec
the
least
flycatcher
should
be
here
by
this
time
have
you
heard
anything
of
him
up
in
the
old
orchard
no
replied
peter
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
looked
for
him
i
on
my
way
to
the
old
orchard
now
and
i
certainly
shall
keep
my
ears
and
eyes
open
for
chebec
i
tell
you
if
i
find
him
dear
me
dear
me
peter
dear
me
replied
phoebe
as
peter
started
off
for
the
old
orchard
perhaps
it
was
because
peter
was
thinking
of
him
that
almost
the
first
voice
he
heard
when
he
reached
the
old
orchard
was
that
of
chebec
repeating
his
own
name
over
and
over
as
if
he
loved
the
sound
of
it
it
did
take
peter
long
to
find
him
he
was
sitting
out
on
the
up
of
one
of
the
upper
branches
of
an
where
he
could
watch
for
flies
and
other
winged
insects
he
looked
so
much
like
phoebe
save
that
he
was
smaller
that
any
one
would
have
know
they
were
cousins
chebec
chebec
chebec
he
repeated
over
and
over
and
with
every
note
jerked
his
tail
now
and
then
he
would
dart
out
into
the
air
and
snap
up
something
so
small
that
peter
looking
up
from
the
ground
could
see
it
at
all
hello
chebec
cried
peter
i
glad
to
see
you
back
again
are
you
going
to
build
in
the
old
orchard
this
year
of
course
i
am
replied
chebec
promptly
mrs
chebec
and
i
have
built
here
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
and
we
would
think
of
going
anywhere
else
chebec
is
looking
for
a
place
now
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
helping
her
but
i
learned
a
long
time
ago
peter
rabbit
that
in
matters
of
this
kind
it
is
just
as
well
not
to
have
any
opinion
at
all
when
chebec
has
picked
out
just
the
place
she
wants
i
help
her
build
the
nest
it
certainly
is
good
to
be
back
here
in
the
old
orchard
and
planning
a
home
once
more
we
made
a
terribly
long
journey
and
i
for
one
am
glad
it
i
just
saw
your
cousins
and
phoebe
and
they
already
have
a
nest
and
eggs
said
peter
the
phoebes
are
a
funny
lot
replied
chebec
they
are
the
only
members
of
the
family
that
can
stand
cold
weather
what
pleasure
they
get
out
of
it
i
do
understand
they
are
queer
anyway
for
they
never
build
their
nests
in
trees
as
the
rest
of
us
are
you
the
smallest
in
the
family
asked
peter
for
it
had
suddenly
struck
him
that
chebec
was
a
very
little
fellow
indeed
chebec
nodded
i
the
smallest
said
he
that
why
they
call
me
least
flycatcher
i
may
be
least
in
size
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
peter
rabbit
and
that
is
that
i
can
catch
just
as
many
bugs
and
flies
as
any
of
suiting
action
to
the
word
he
darted
out
into
the
air
his
little
bill
snapped
and
with
a
quick
turn
he
was
back
on
his
former
perch
jerking
his
tail
and
uttering
his
sharp
little
cry
of
chebec
chebec
chebec
until
peter
began
to
wonder
which
he
was
the
most
fond
of
catching
flies
or
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
presently
they
both
heard
chebec
calling
from
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
old
orchard
excuse
me
peter
said
chebec
i
must
go
at
once
chebec
says
she
has
found
just
the
place
for
our
nest
and
now
we
got
a
busy
time
ahead
of
us
we
are
very
particular
how
we
build
a
do
you
start
it
with
mud
the
way
welcome
robin
and
your
cousins
the
phoebes
do
asked
peter
mud
cried
chebec
scornfully
mud
i
should
say
not
i
would
have
you
understand
peter
that
we
are
very
particular
about
what
we
use
in
our
nest
we
use
only
the
finest
of
rootlets
strips
of
soft
bark
fibers
of
plants
the
brown
cotton
that
grows
on
ferns
and
perhaps
a
little
hair
when
we
can
find
it
we
make
a
dainty
nest
if
i
do
say
it
and
we
fasten
it
securely
in
the
fork
made
by
two
or
three
upright
little
branches
now
i
must
go
because
chebec
is
getting
impatient
come
see
me
when
i
not
so
busy
chapter
vii
the
watchman
of
the
old
orchard
a
few
days
after
chebec
and
his
wife
started
building
their
nest
in
the
old
orchard
peter
dropped
around
as
usual
for
a
very
early
call
he
found
chebec
very
busy
hunting
for
materials
for
that
nest
because
as
he
explained
to
peter
chebec
is
very
particular
indeed
about
what
her
nest
is
made
of
but
he
had
time
to
tell
peter
a
bit
of
news
my
fighting
cousin
and
my
handsomest
cousin
arrived
together
yesterday
and
now
our
family
is
very
well
represented
in
the
old
orchard
said
chebec
proudly
slowly
peter
reached
over
his
back
with
his
long
left
hind
foot
and
thoughtfully
scratched
his
long
right
ear
he
did
like
to
admit
that
he
could
recall
those
two
cousins
of
chebec
did
you
say
your
fighting
cousin
he
asked
in
a
hesitating
way
that
what
i
said
replied
chebec
he
is
scrapper
the
kingbird
as
of
course
you
know
the
rest
of
us
always
feel
safe
when
he
is
of
course
i
know
him
declared
peter
his
face
clearing
where
is
he
now
at
that
very
instant
a
great
racket
broke
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
old
orchard
and
in
no
time
at
all
the
feathered
folks
were
hurrying
from
every
direction
screaming
at
the
top
of
their
voices
of
course
peter
could
be
left
out
of
anything
like
that
and
he
scampered
for
the
scene
of
trouble
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
take
him
when
he
got
there
he
saw
redtail
the
hawk
flying
up
and
down
and
this
way
and
that
way
as
if
trying
to
get
away
from
something
or
somebody
for
a
minute
peter
could
think
what
was
the
trouble
with
redtail
and
then
he
saw
a
bird
having
a
black
cap
and
back
and
a
broad
white
band
across
the
end
of
his
tail
was
darting
at
redtail
as
if
he
meant
to
pull
out
every
feather
in
the
coat
he
was
just
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
and
in
comparison
with
him
redtail
was
a
perfect
giant
but
this
seemed
to
make
no
difference
to
scrapper
for
that
is
who
it
was
he
was
afraid
and
he
intended
that
everybody
should
know
it
especially
redtail
it
is
because
of
his
fearlessness
that
he
is
called
kingbird
all
the
time
he
was
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
calling
redtail
a
robber
and
every
other
bad
name
he
could
think
of
all
the
other
birds
joined
him
in
calling
redtail
bad
names
but
none
not
even
bully
the
english
sparrow
was
brave
enough
to
join
him
in
attacking
big
redtail
when
he
had
succeeded
in
driving
redtail
far
enough
from
the
old
orchard
to
suit
him
scrapper
flew
back
and
perched
on
a
dead
branch
of
one
of
the
trees
where
he
received
the
congratulations
of
all
his
feathered
neighbors
he
took
them
quite
modestly
assuring
them
that
he
had
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
but
that
he
did
intend
to
have
any
of
the
hawk
family
around
the
old
orchard
while
he
lived
there
peter
help
but
admire
scrapper
for
his
courage
as
peter
looked
up
at
scrapper
he
saw
that
like
all
the
rest
of
the
flycatchers
there
was
just
the
tiniest
of
hooks
on
the
end
of
his
bill
scrapper
slightly
raised
cap
seemed
all
black
but
if
peter
could
have
gotten
close
enough
he
would
have
found
that
hidden
in
it
was
a
patch
of
while
peter
sat
staring
up
at
him
scrapper
suddenly
darted
out
into
the
air
and
his
bill
snapped
in
quite
the
same
way
chebec
did
when
he
caught
a
fly
but
it
was
a
fly
that
scrapper
had
it
was
a
bee
peter
saw
it
very
distinctly
just
as
scrapper
snapped
it
up
it
reminded
peter
that
he
had
often
heard
scrapper
called
the
bee
martin
and
now
he
understood
why
do
you
live
on
bees
altogether
asked
peter
bless
your
heart
peter
no
replied
scrapper
with
a
chuckle
there
would
be
any
honey
if
i
did
i
like
bees
i
like
them
first
rate
but
they
form
only
a
very
small
part
of
my
food
those
that
i
do
catch
are
mostly
drones
and
you
know
the
drones
are
useless
they
do
no
work
at
all
it
is
only
by
accident
that
i
now
and
then
catch
a
worker
i
eat
all
kinds
of
insects
that
fly
and
some
that
do
i
one
of
farmer
brown
best
friends
if
he
did
but
know
it
you
can
talk
all
you
please
about
the
wonderful
eyesight
of
the
members
of
the
hawk
family
but
if
any
one
of
them
has
better
eyesight
than
i
have
i
like
to
know
who
it
is
there
a
fly
over
there
beyond
that
old
watch
me
catch
peter
knew
better
than
to
waste
any
effort
trying
to
see
that
fly
he
knew
that
he
could
have
seen
it
had
it
been
only
one
fourth
that
distance
away
but
if
he
could
see
the
fly
he
could
hear
the
sharp
click
of
scrapper
bill
and
he
knew
by
the
way
scrapper
kept
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
after
his
return
that
he
had
caught
that
fly
and
it
had
tasted
good
are
you
going
to
build
in
the
old
orchard
this
year
asked
peter
of
course
i
am
declared
scrapper
i
just
then
he
spied
blacky
the
crow
and
dashed
out
to
meet
him
blacky
saw
him
coming
and
was
wise
enough
to
suddenly
appear
to
have
no
interest
whatever
in
the
old
orchard
turning
away
toward
the
green
meadows
instead
peter
did
wait
for
scrapper
to
return
it
was
getting
high
time
for
him
to
scamper
home
to
the
dear
old
and
so
he
started
along
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
far
corner
of
the
old
orchard
some
one
called
him
peter
oh
peter
rabbit
called
the
voice
peter
stopped
abruptly
sat
up
very
straight
looked
this
way
looked
that
way
and
looked
the
other
way
every
way
but
the
right
way
look
up
over
your
head
cried
the
voice
rather
a
harsh
voice
peter
looked
then
all
in
a
flash
it
came
to
him
who
it
was
chebec
had
meant
by
the
handsomest
member
of
his
family
it
was
cresty
the
great
crested
flycatcher
he
was
a
wee
bit
bigger
than
scrapper
the
kingbird
yet
not
quite
so
big
as
welcome
robin
and
more
slender
his
throat
and
breast
were
gray
shading
into
bright
yellow
underneath
his
back
and
head
were
of
a
with
a
tint
of
a
pointed
cap
was
all
that
was
needed
to
make
him
quite
distinguished
looking
he
certainly
was
the
handsomest
as
well
as
the
largest
of
the
flycatcher
family
you
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
so
do
let
me
detain
you
peter
said
cresty
before
peter
could
find
his
tongue
i
just
want
to
ask
one
little
favor
of
what
is
it
asked
peter
who
is
always
glad
to
do
any
one
a
favor
if
in
your
roaming
about
you
run
across
an
old
suit
of
black
snake
or
of
any
other
member
of
the
snake
family
i
wish
you
would
remember
me
and
let
me
know
will
you
peter
said
cresty
a
a
a
what
stammered
peter
a
suit
of
clothes
from
any
member
of
the
snake
family
replied
cresty
somewhat
impatiently
now
do
forget
peter
got
to
go
house
hunting
but
you
find
me
there
or
hereabouts
if
it
happens
that
you
find
one
of
those
snake
before
peter
could
say
another
word
cresty
had
flown
away
peter
hesitated
looking
first
towards
the
dear
old
and
then
towards
jenny
wren
house
he
just
could
understand
about
those
suits
of
the
snake
family
and
he
felt
sure
that
jenny
wren
could
tell
him
finally
curiosity
got
the
best
of
him
and
back
he
scampered
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
in
which
jenny
wren
had
her
home
jenny
called
peter
jenny
wren
jenny
wren
no
one
answered
him
he
could
hear
wren
singing
in
another
tree
but
he
could
see
him
jenny
jenny
wren
jenny
wren
called
peter
again
this
time
jenny
popped
her
head
out
and
her
little
eyes
fairly
snapped
did
i
tell
you
the
other
day
peter
rabbit
that
i
not
to
be
disturbed
i
tell
you
that
i
got
seven
eggs
in
here
and
that
i
ca
spend
any
time
gossiping
did
i
peter
rabbit
did
i
did
i
you
certainly
did
jenny
you
certainly
did
and
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
replied
peter
meekly
i
would
have
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
but
i
just
did
know
who
else
to
go
go
to
for
what
snapped
jenny
wren
what
is
it
you
come
to
me
for
snake
skins
replied
peter
snake
skins
snake
skins
shrieked
jenny
wren
what
are
you
talking
about
peter
rabbit
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
snake
skins
and
do
want
to
ugh
it
makes
me
shiver
just
to
think
of
you
do
understand
cried
peter
hurriedly
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
should
cresty
the
flycatcher
ask
me
to
please
let
him
know
if
i
found
any
suits
of
the
snake
family
he
flew
away
before
i
could
ask
him
why
he
wants
them
and
so
i
came
to
you
because
i
know
you
know
everything
especially
everything
concerning
your
jenny
wren
looked
as
if
she
did
know
whether
to
feel
flattered
or
provoked
but
peter
looked
so
innocent
that
she
concluded
he
was
trying
to
say
something
nice
chapter
viii
old
clothes
and
old
houses
i
ca
stop
to
talk
to
you
any
longer
now
peter
rabbit
said
jenny
wren
but
if
you
will
come
over
here
bright
and
early
morning
while
i
am
out
to
get
my
breakfast
i
will
tell
you
about
cresty
the
flycatcher
and
why
he
wants
the
clothes
of
some
of
the
snake
family
perhaps
i
should
say
what
he
wants
of
them
instead
of
why
he
wants
them
for
why
any
one
should
want
anything
to
do
with
snakes
is
more
then
i
can
with
this
jenny
wren
disappeared
inside
her
house
and
there
was
nothing
for
peter
to
do
but
once
more
start
for
the
dear
old
on
his
way
he
could
resist
the
temptation
to
run
over
to
the
green
forest
which
was
just
beyond
the
old
orchard
he
just
had
to
find
out
if
there
was
anything
new
over
there
hardly
had
he
reached
it
when
he
heard
a
plaintive
voice
crying
peter
chuckled
happily
i
declare
there
he
cried
he
usually
is
one
of
the
last
of
the
flycatcher
family
to
arrive
i
did
expect
to
find
him
yet
i
wonder
what
has
brought
him
up
so
it
did
take
peter
long
to
find
pewee
he
just
followed
the
sound
of
that
voice
and
presently
saw
pewee
fly
out
and
make
the
same
kind
of
a
little
circle
as
the
other
members
of
the
family
make
when
they
are
hunting
flies
it
ended
just
where
it
had
started
on
a
dead
twig
of
a
tree
in
a
shady
rather
lonely
part
of
the
green
forest
almost
at
once
he
began
to
call
his
name
in
a
rather
sad
plaintive
tone
but
he
was
sad
as
peter
well
knew
it
was
his
way
of
expressing
how
happy
he
felt
he
was
a
little
bigger
than
his
cousin
chebec
but
looked
very
much
like
him
there
was
a
little
notch
in
the
end
of
his
tail
the
upper
half
of
his
bill
was
black
but
the
lower
half
was
light
peter
could
see
on
each
wing
two
whitish
bars
and
he
noticed
that
pewee
wings
were
longer
than
his
tail
which
was
the
case
with
chebec
but
no
one
could
ever
mistake
pewee
for
any
of
his
relatives
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
keeps
repeating
his
own
name
over
and
over
are
you
here
early
asked
peter
pewee
nodded
yes
said
he
it
has
been
unusually
warm
this
spring
so
i
hurried
a
little
and
came
up
with
my
cousins
scrapper
and
cresty
that
is
something
i
do
often
if
you
please
peter
inquired
politely
why
do
folks
call
you
wood
pewee
pewee
chuckled
happily
it
must
be
said
he
because
i
am
so
very
fond
of
the
green
forest
it
is
so
quiet
and
restful
that
i
love
it
pewee
and
i
are
very
retiring
we
do
not
like
too
many
near
you
wo
mind
if
i
come
to
see
you
once
in
a
while
will
you
asked
peter
as
he
prepared
to
start
on
again
for
the
dear
old
come
as
often
as
you
like
replied
pewee
the
oftener
the
back
in
the
old
peter
thought
over
all
he
had
learned
about
the
flycatcher
family
and
as
he
recalled
how
they
were
forever
catching
all
sorts
of
flying
insects
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
they
must
be
very
useful
little
people
in
helping
old
mother
nature
take
care
of
her
trees
and
other
growing
things
which
insects
so
dearly
love
to
destroy
but
most
of
all
peter
thought
about
that
queer
request
of
cresty
and
a
dozen
times
that
day
he
found
himself
peeping
under
old
logs
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
coat
of
black
snake
it
was
such
a
funny
thing
for
cresty
to
ask
for
that
peter
curiosity
would
allow
him
no
peace
and
the
next
morning
he
was
up
in
the
old
orchard
before
jolly
sun
had
kicked
his
bedclothes
off
jenny
wren
was
as
good
as
her
word
while
she
flitted
and
hopped
about
this
way
and
that
way
in
that
fussy
way
of
hers
getting
her
breakfast
she
talked
jenny
could
keep
her
tongue
still
if
she
wanted
to
did
you
find
any
old
clothes
of
the
snake
family
she
demanded
then
as
peter
shook
his
head
her
tongue
ran
on
without
waiting
for
him
to
reply
cresty
and
his
wife
always
insist
upon
having
a
piece
of
snake
skin
in
their
nest
said
she
why
they
want
it
goodness
knows
but
they
do
want
it
and
never
can
seem
to
settle
down
to
housekeeping
unless
they
have
it
perhaps
they
think
it
will
scare
robbers
away
as
for
me
i
should
have
a
cold
chill
every
time
i
got
into
my
nest
if
i
had
to
sit
on
anything
like
that
i
have
to
admit
that
cresty
and
his
wife
are
a
handsome
couple
and
they
certainly
have
good
sense
in
choosing
a
house
more
sense
than
any
other
member
of
their
family
to
my
way
of
thinking
but
snake
skins
ugh
by
the
way
where
does
cresty
build
asked
peter
in
a
hole
in
a
tree
like
the
rest
of
us
sensible
people
retorted
jenny
wren
promptly
peter
looked
quite
as
surprised
as
he
felt
does
cresty
make
the
hole
he
asked
goodness
gracious
no
exclaimed
jenny
wren
where
are
your
eyes
peter
did
you
ever
see
a
flycatcher
with
a
bill
that
looked
as
if
it
could
cut
wood
she
did
wait
for
a
reply
but
rattled
on
it
is
a
good
thing
for
a
lot
of
us
that
the
woodpecker
family
are
so
fond
of
new
houses
look
there
is
downy
the
woodpecker
hard
at
work
on
a
new
house
this
very
minute
that
good
i
like
to
see
that
it
means
that
next
year
there
will
be
one
more
house
for
some
one
here
in
the
old
orchard
for
myself
i
prefer
old
houses
i
noticed
there
are
a
number
of
my
neighbors
who
feel
the
same
way
about
it
there
is
something
settled
about
an
old
house
it
does
attract
attention
the
way
a
new
one
does
so
long
as
it
has
got
reasonably
good
walls
and
the
rain
and
the
wind
ca
get
in
the
older
it
is
the
better
it
suits
me
but
the
woodpeckers
seem
to
like
new
houses
best
which
as
i
said
before
is
a
very
good
thing
for
the
rest
of
who
is
there
besides
you
and
cresty
and
bully
the
english
sparrow
who
uses
these
old
woodpecker
houses
asked
peter
winsome
bluebird
stupid
snapped
jenny
wren
peter
grinned
and
looked
foolish
of
course
said
he
i
forgot
all
about
and
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
added
jenny
that
so
i
ought
to
have
remembered
him
exclaimed
peter
noticed
that
he
is
very
fond
of
the
same
house
year
after
year
is
there
anybody
else
again
jenny
wren
nodded
the
nuthatch
uses
an
old
house
told
but
he
usually
goes
up
north
for
his
nesting
said
she
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
sometimes
uses
an
old
house
then
again
he
and
chickadee
get
fussy
and
make
a
house
for
themselves
yellow
wing
the
flicker
who
really
is
a
woodpecker
often
uses
an
old
house
but
quite
often
makes
a
new
one
then
there
are
killy
the
sparrow
hawk
and
spooky
the
screech
peter
looked
surprised
i
did
suppose
they
nested
in
holes
in
trees
he
exclaimed
they
certainly
do
more
the
pity
snapped
jenny
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
rest
of
us
if
they
did
nest
at
all
but
they
do
and
an
old
house
of
yellow
wing
the
flicker
suits
either
of
them
killy
always
uses
one
that
is
high
up
and
comes
back
to
it
year
after
year
spooky
is
particular
so
long
as
the
house
is
big
enough
to
be
comfortable
he
lives
in
it
more
or
less
the
year
around
now
i
must
get
back
to
those
eggs
of
mine
i
talked
quite
enough
for
one
oh
jenny
cried
peter
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
jenny
paused
and
jerked
her
tail
impatiently
well
what
is
it
now
she
demanded
have
you
got
two
homes
asked
peter
goodness
gracious
no
exclaimed
jenny
what
do
you
suppose
i
want
of
two
homes
one
is
all
i
can
take
care
then
why
demanded
peter
triumphantly
does
wren
work
all
day
carrying
sticks
and
straws
into
a
hole
in
another
tree
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
carried
enough
in
there
to
build
two
or
three
jenny
wren
eyes
twinkled
and
she
laughed
softly
mr
wren
just
has
to
be
busy
about
something
bless
his
heart
said
she
he
has
a
lazy
feather
on
him
he
building
that
nest
to
take
up
his
time
and
keep
out
of
mischief
besides
if
he
fills
that
hollow
up
nobody
else
will
take
it
and
you
know
we
might
want
to
move
some
time
with
a
final
jerk
of
her
tail
jenny
wren
flew
to
the
little
round
doorway
of
her
house
and
popped
inside
chapter
ix
longbill
and
teeter
from
the
decided
way
in
which
jenny
wren
had
popped
into
the
little
round
doorway
of
her
home
peter
knew
that
to
wait
in
the
hope
of
more
gossip
with
her
would
be
a
waste
of
time
he
was
ready
to
go
back
home
to
the
dear
old
yet
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
for
everybody
in
the
old
orchard
was
too
busy
for
idle
gossip
peter
scratched
a
long
ear
with
a
long
hind
foot
trying
to
think
of
some
place
to
go
just
then
he
heard
the
clear
peep
peep
peep
of
the
hylas
the
sweet
singers
of
the
smiling
pool
that
where
i
go
exclaimed
peter
i
have
been
to
the
smiling
pool
for
some
time
i
just
run
over
and
pay
my
respects
to
grandfather
frog
and
to
redwing
the
blackbird
redwing
was
one
of
the
first
birds
to
arrive
and
i
neglected
him
when
peter
thinks
of
something
to
do
he
wastes
no
time
off
he
started
for
the
smiling
pool
he
kept
close
to
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
until
he
reached
the
place
where
the
laughing
brook
comes
out
of
the
green
forest
on
its
way
to
the
smiling
pool
in
the
green
meadows
bushes
and
young
trees
grow
along
the
banks
of
the
laughing
brook
at
this
point
the
ground
was
soft
in
places
quite
muddy
peter
does
mind
getting
his
feet
damp
so
he
hopped
along
carelessly
from
right
under
his
very
nose
something
shot
up
into
the
air
with
a
whistling
sound
it
startled
peter
so
that
he
stopped
short
with
his
eyes
popping
out
of
his
head
he
had
just
a
glimpse
of
a
brown
form
disappearing
over
the
tops
of
some
tall
bushes
then
peter
chuckled
i
declare
said
he
i
had
forgotten
all
about
my
old
friend
longbill
the
woodcock
he
scared
me
for
a
then
you
are
even
said
a
voice
close
at
hand
you
scared
him
i
saw
you
coming
but
longbill
peter
turned
quickly
there
was
woodcock
peeping
at
him
from
behind
a
tussock
of
grass
i
did
mean
to
scare
him
apologized
peter
i
really
did
mean
to
do
you
think
he
was
really
very
much
scared
not
too
scared
to
come
back
anyway
said
longbill
himself
dropping
down
just
in
front
of
peter
i
recognized
you
just
as
i
was
disappearing
over
the
tops
of
the
bushes
so
i
came
right
back
i
learned
when
i
was
very
young
that
when
startled
it
is
best
to
fly
first
and
find
out
afterwards
whether
or
not
there
is
real
danger
i
am
glad
it
is
no
one
but
you
peter
for
i
was
having
a
splendid
meal
here
and
i
should
have
hated
to
leave
it
you
excuse
me
while
i
go
on
eating
i
hope
we
can
talk
between
certainly
i
excuse
you
replied
peter
staring
around
very
hard
to
see
what
it
could
be
longbill
was
making
such
a
good
meal
of
but
peter
could
see
a
thing
that
looked
good
to
eat
there
was
even
a
bug
or
a
worm
crawling
on
the
ground
longbill
took
two
or
three
steps
in
rather
a
stately
fashion
peter
had
to
hide
a
smile
for
longbill
had
such
an
air
of
importance
yet
at
the
same
time
was
such
an
odd
looking
fellow
he
was
quite
a
little
bigger
than
welcome
robin
his
tail
was
short
his
legs
were
short
and
his
neck
was
short
but
his
bill
was
long
enough
to
make
up
his
back
was
a
mixture
of
gray
brown
black
and
buff
while
his
breast
and
under
parts
were
a
beautiful
it
was
his
head
that
made
him
look
queer
his
eyes
were
very
big
and
they
were
set
so
far
back
that
peter
wondered
if
it
was
easier
for
him
to
look
behind
him
than
in
front
of
him
suddenly
longbill
plunged
his
bill
into
the
ground
he
plunged
it
in
for
the
whole
length
then
he
pulled
it
out
and
peter
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
tail
end
of
a
worm
disappearing
down
longbill
throat
where
that
long
bill
had
gone
into
the
ground
was
a
neat
little
round
hole
for
the
first
time
peter
noticed
that
there
were
many
such
little
round
holes
all
about
did
you
make
all
those
little
round
holes
exclaimed
peter
not
at
all
replied
longbill
mrs
woodcock
made
some
of
and
was
there
a
worm
in
every
one
asked
peter
his
eyes
very
wide
with
interest
longbill
nodded
of
course
said
he
you
do
suppose
we
would
take
the
trouble
to
bore
one
of
them
if
we
did
know
that
we
would
get
a
worm
at
the
end
of
it
do
you
peter
remembered
how
he
had
watched
welcome
robin
listen
and
then
suddenly
plunge
his
bill
into
the
ground
and
pull
out
a
worm
but
the
worms
welcome
robin
got
were
always
close
to
the
surface
while
these
worms
were
so
deep
in
the
earth
that
peter
could
understand
how
it
was
possible
for
any
one
to
know
that
they
were
there
welcome
robin
could
see
when
he
got
hold
of
a
worm
but
longbill
could
even
if
you
know
there
is
a
worm
down
there
in
the
ground
how
do
you
know
when
you
reached
him
and
how
is
it
possible
for
you
to
open
your
bill
down
there
to
take
him
in
asked
peter
longbill
chuckled
that
easy
said
he
i
got
the
handiest
bill
that
ever
was
see
here
longbill
suddenly
thrust
his
bill
straight
out
in
front
of
him
and
to
peter
astonishment
he
lifted
the
end
of
the
upper
half
without
opening
the
rest
of
his
bill
at
all
that
the
way
i
get
them
said
he
i
can
feel
them
when
i
reach
them
and
then
i
just
open
the
top
of
my
bill
and
grab
them
i
think
there
is
one
right
under
my
feet
now
watch
me
get
longbill
bored
into
the
ground
until
his
head
was
almost
against
it
when
he
pulled
his
bill
out
sure
enough
there
was
a
worm
of
course
explained
longbill
it
is
only
in
soft
ground
that
i
can
do
this
that
is
why
i
have
to
fly
away
south
as
soon
as
the
ground
freezes
at
it
wonderful
sighed
peter
i
do
suppose
any
one
else
can
find
hidden
worms
that
my
cousin
jack
snipe
can
replied
longbill
promptly
he
feeds
the
same
way
i
do
only
he
likes
marshy
meadows
instead
of
brushy
swamps
perhaps
you
know
peter
nodded
i
do
said
he
now
you
speak
of
it
there
is
a
strong
family
resemblance
although
i
had
thought
of
him
as
a
relative
of
yours
before
now
i
must
be
running
along
i
ever
so
glad
to
have
seen
you
and
i
coming
over
to
call
again
the
first
chance
i
so
peter
said
and
kept
on
down
the
laughing
brook
to
the
smiling
pool
right
where
the
laughing
brook
entered
the
smiling
pool
there
was
a
little
pebbly
beach
running
along
the
very
edge
of
the
water
was
a
slim
trim
little
bird
with
fairly
long
legs
a
long
slender
bill
back
with
black
spots
and
markings
and
a
white
waistcoat
neatly
spotted
with
black
every
few
steps
he
would
stop
to
pick
up
something
then
stand
for
a
second
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
funniest
way
as
if
his
body
was
so
nicely
balanced
on
his
legs
that
it
teetered
back
and
forth
like
a
seesaw
it
was
teeter
the
spotted
sandpiper
an
old
friend
of
peter
peter
greeted
him
joyously
cried
teeter
turning
towards
peter
and
bobbing
and
bowing
as
only
teeter
can
before
peter
could
say
another
word
teeter
came
running
towards
him
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
teeter
was
very
anxious
about
something
do
move
peter
rabbit
do
move
he
cried
why
not
demanded
peter
for
he
could
see
no
danger
and
could
think
of
no
reason
why
he
should
move
just
then
teeter
came
hurrying
up
and
squatted
down
in
the
sand
right
in
front
of
peter
thank
goodness
exclaimed
teeter
still
bobbing
and
bowing
if
you
had
taken
another
step
peter
rabbit
you
would
have
stepped
right
on
our
eggs
you
gave
me
a
dreadful
peter
was
puzzled
he
showed
it
as
he
stared
down
at
teeter
just
in
front
of
him
i
do
see
any
nest
or
eggs
or
anything
said
he
rather
testily
teeter
stood
up
and
stepped
aside
then
peter
saw
right
in
a
little
hollow
in
the
sand
with
just
a
few
bits
of
grass
for
a
lining
four
white
eggs
with
big
dark
blotches
on
them
they
looked
so
much
like
the
surrounding
pebbles
that
he
never
would
have
seen
them
in
the
world
but
for
teeter
peter
hastily
backed
away
a
few
steps
teeter
slipped
back
on
the
eggs
and
settled
herself
comfortably
it
suddenly
struck
peter
that
if
he
had
seen
her
do
it
he
would
have
known
she
was
there
you
see
she
looked
so
much
like
her
surroundings
that
he
never
would
have
noticed
her
at
all
my
he
exclaimed
i
certainly
would
have
stepped
on
those
eggs
if
you
had
warned
me
said
he
i
so
thankful
i
did
i
do
see
how
you
dare
lay
them
in
the
open
like
teeter
chuckled
softly
it
the
safest
place
in
the
world
peter
said
she
they
look
so
much
like
these
pebbles
around
here
that
no
one
sees
them
the
only
time
they
are
in
danger
is
when
somebody
comes
along
as
you
did
and
is
likely
to
step
on
them
without
seeing
them
but
that
does
happen
chapter
redwing
and
yellow
wing
peter
had
come
over
to
the
smiling
pool
especially
to
pay
his
respects
to
redwing
the
blackbird
so
as
soon
as
he
could
without
being
impolite
he
left
teeter
sitting
on
her
eggs
and
teeter
himself
bobbing
and
bowing
in
the
friendliest
way
and
hurried
over
to
where
the
bulrushes
grow
in
the
very
top
of
the
big
a
little
farther
along
on
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
sat
some
one
who
at
that
distance
appeared
to
be
dressed
all
in
black
he
was
singing
as
if
there
were
nothing
but
joy
in
all
the
great
world
he
sang
peter
would
have
known
from
this
song
alone
that
it
was
redwing
the
blackbird
for
there
is
no
other
song
quite
like
it
as
soon
as
peter
appeared
in
sight
redwing
left
his
high
perch
and
flew
down
to
light
among
the
bulrushes
as
he
flew
peter
saw
the
beautiful
red
patch
on
the
bend
of
each
wing
from
which
redwing
gets
his
name
no
one
could
ever
mistake
him
for
anybody
else
thought
peter
for
there
is
anybody
else
with
such
beautiful
shoulder
what
the
news
peter
rabbit
cried
redwing
coming
over
to
sit
very
near
peter
there
is
much
replied
peter
excepting
that
teeter
the
sandpiper
has
four
eggs
just
a
little
way
from
redwing
chuckled
that
is
no
news
peter
said
he
do
you
suppose
that
i
live
neighbor
to
teeter
and
do
know
where
his
nest
is
and
all
about
his
affairs
there
is
much
going
on
around
the
smiling
pool
that
i
do
know
i
can
tell
you
peter
looked
a
little
disappointed
because
there
is
nothing
he
likes
better
than
to
be
the
bearer
of
news
i
suppose
said
he
politely
that
you
will
be
building
a
nest
pretty
soon
yourself
redwing
chuckled
softly
it
was
a
happy
contented
sort
of
chuckle
no
peter
said
he
i
am
not
going
to
build
a
what
exclaimed
peter
and
his
two
long
ears
stood
straight
up
with
astonishment
no
replied
redwing
still
chuckling
i
not
going
to
build
a
nest
and
if
you
want
to
know
a
little
secret
we
have
four
as
pretty
eggs
as
ever
were
peter
fairly
bubbled
over
with
interest
and
curiosity
how
splendid
he
cried
where
is
your
nest
redwing
i
would
just
love
to
see
it
i
suppose
it
is
because
she
is
sitting
on
those
eggs
that
i
have
seen
redwing
it
was
very
stupid
of
me
not
to
guess
that
folks
who
come
as
early
as
you
do
would
be
among
the
first
to
build
a
home
where
is
it
redwing
do
tell
redwing
eyes
twinkled
a
secret
which
is
known
by
three
full
soon
will
not
a
secret
be
said
he
it
is
that
i
do
trust
you
peter
i
know
that
you
would
intentionally
let
my
secret
slip
out
but
you
might
do
it
by
accident
what
you
do
know
you
ca
that
right
redwing
i
am
glad
you
have
so
much
sense
said
another
voice
and
redwing
alighted
very
near
to
redwing
peter
could
help
thinking
that
old
mother
nature
had
been
very
unfair
indeed
in
dressing
redwing
she
was
if
anything
a
little
bit
smaller
than
her
handsome
husband
and
such
a
plain
not
to
say
homely
little
body
that
it
was
hard
work
to
realize
that
she
was
a
blackbird
at
all
in
the
first
place
she
was
black
she
was
dressed
all
over
in
with
streaks
of
darker
brown
which
in
places
were
almost
black
she
wore
no
shoulder
patches
in
fact
there
was
a
bright
feather
on
her
anywhere
peter
wanted
to
ask
why
it
was
that
she
was
so
plainly
dressed
but
he
was
too
polite
and
decided
to
wait
until
he
should
see
jenny
wren
she
would
be
sure
to
know
instead
he
exclaimed
how
do
you
do
redwing
i
ever
so
glad
to
see
you
i
was
wondering
where
you
were
where
did
you
come
from
straight
from
my
home
replied
redwing
demurely
and
if
i
do
say
it
it
is
the
best
home
we
ever
redwing
chuckled
he
was
full
of
chuckles
you
see
he
had
noticed
how
eagerly
peter
was
looking
everywhere
this
much
i
will
tell
you
peter
said
redwing
our
nest
is
somewhere
in
these
bulrushes
and
if
you
can
find
it
we
wo
say
a
word
even
if
you
do
keep
the
then
redwing
chuckled
again
and
redwing
chuckled
with
him
you
see
they
knew
that
peter
does
like
water
and
that
nest
was
hidden
in
a
certain
clump
of
brown
rushes
with
water
all
around
suddenly
redwing
flew
up
in
the
air
with
a
harsh
cry
run
peter
run
he
screamed
here
comes
reddy
fox
peter
did
wait
for
a
second
warning
he
knew
by
the
sound
of
redwing
voice
that
redwing
was
joking
there
was
just
one
place
of
safety
and
that
was
an
old
hole
of
grandfather
chuck
between
the
roots
of
the
big
peter
did
waste
any
time
getting
there
and
he
was
none
too
soon
for
reddy
was
so
close
at
his
heels
that
he
pulled
some
white
hairs
out
of
peter
tail
as
peter
plunged
headfirst
down
that
hole
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
peter
that
that
hole
was
too
small
for
reddy
to
follow
and
the
roots
prevented
reddy
from
digging
it
any
bigger
for
a
long
time
peter
sat
in
grandfather
chuck
old
house
wondering
how
soon
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
come
out
for
a
while
he
heard
and
redwing
scolding
sharply
and
by
this
he
knew
that
reddy
fox
was
still
about
by
and
by
they
stopped
scolding
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
redwing
happy
song
that
means
thought
peter
that
reddy
fox
has
gone
away
but
i
think
i
sit
here
a
while
longer
to
make
now
peter
was
sitting
right
under
the
big
after
a
while
he
began
to
hear
faint
little
sounds
little
taps
and
scratching
sounds
as
of
claws
they
seemed
to
come
from
right
over
his
head
but
he
knew
that
there
was
no
one
in
that
hole
but
himself
he
could
understand
it
at
all
finally
peter
decided
it
would
be
safe
to
peek
outside
very
carefully
he
poked
his
head
out
just
as
he
did
so
a
little
chip
struck
him
right
on
the
nose
peter
pulled
his
head
back
hurriedly
and
stared
at
the
little
chip
which
lay
just
in
front
of
the
hole
then
two
or
three
more
little
chips
fell
peter
knew
that
they
must
come
from
up
in
the
big
and
right
away
his
curiosity
was
aroused
redwing
was
singing
so
happily
that
peter
felt
sure
no
danger
was
near
so
he
hopped
outside
and
looked
up
to
find
out
where
those
little
chips
had
come
from
just
a
few
feet
above
his
head
he
saw
a
round
hole
in
the
trunk
of
the
big
while
he
was
looking
at
it
a
head
with
a
long
stout
bill
was
thrust
out
and
in
that
bill
were
two
or
three
little
chips
peter
heart
gave
a
little
jump
of
glad
surprise
yellow
wing
he
cried
my
goodness
how
you
startled
me
the
chips
were
dropped
and
the
head
was
thrust
farther
out
the
sides
and
throat
were
a
soft
and
on
each
side
at
the
beginning
of
the
bill
was
a
black
patch
the
top
of
the
head
was
gray
and
just
at
the
back
was
a
little
band
of
bright
red
there
was
no
mistaking
that
head
it
belonged
to
yellow
wing
the
flicker
beyond
a
doubt
hello
peter
exclaimed
yellow
wing
his
eyes
twinkling
what
are
you
doing
here
nothing
replied
peter
but
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
what
are
all
those
chips
i
fixing
up
this
old
house
of
mine
replied
yellow
wing
promptly
it
was
quite
deep
enough
to
suit
me
so
i
am
making
it
a
little
deeper
yellow
wing
and
i
have
been
able
to
find
another
house
to
suit
us
so
we
have
decided
to
live
here
again
this
he
came
wholly
out
and
flew
down
on
the
ground
near
peter
when
his
wings
were
spread
peter
saw
that
on
the
under
sides
they
were
a
beautiful
as
were
the
under
sides
of
his
tail
feathers
around
his
throat
was
a
broad
black
collar
from
this
clear
to
his
tail
were
black
dots
when
his
wings
were
spread
the
upper
part
of
his
body
just
above
the
tail
was
pure
white
my
exclaimed
peter
you
are
a
handsome
fellow
i
never
realized
before
how
handsome
you
yellow
wing
looked
pleased
perhaps
he
felt
a
little
flattered
i
am
glad
you
think
so
peter
said
he
i
am
rather
proud
of
my
suit
myself
i
do
know
of
any
member
of
my
family
with
whom
i
would
change
a
sudden
thought
struck
peter
what
family
do
you
belong
to
he
asked
abruptly
the
woodpecker
family
replied
yellow
wing
proudly
chapter
xi
drummers
and
carpenters
peter
rabbit
was
so
full
of
questions
that
he
hardly
knew
which
one
to
ask
first
but
yellow
wing
the
flicker
did
give
him
a
chance
to
ask
any
from
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
there
came
a
clear
loud
call
of
excuse
me
peter
there
yellow
wing
calling
me
exclaimed
yellow
wing
and
away
he
went
peter
noticed
that
as
he
flew
he
went
up
and
down
it
seemed
very
much
as
if
he
bounded
through
the
air
just
as
peter
bounds
over
the
ground
i
would
know
him
by
the
way
he
flies
just
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
thought
peter
as
he
started
for
home
in
the
dear
old
somehow
he
does
seem
like
a
woodpecker
because
he
is
on
the
ground
so
much
i
must
ask
jenny
wren
about
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
peter
had
a
chance
for
a
bit
of
gossip
with
jenny
wren
when
he
did
the
first
thing
he
asked
was
if
yellow
wing
is
a
true
woodpecker
certainly
he
is
replied
jenny
wren
of
course
he
is
why
under
the
sun
should
you
think
he
is
because
it
seems
to
me
he
is
on
the
ground
more
than
he
in
the
trees
retorted
peter
i
do
know
any
other
woodpeckers
who
come
down
on
the
ground
at
tut
tut
tut
tut
scolded
jenny
think
a
minute
peter
think
a
minute
have
you
ever
seen
redhead
on
the
ground
peter
blinked
his
eyes
he
said
slowly
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
i
seen
him
picking
up
beechnuts
in
the
fall
the
woodpeckers
are
a
funny
family
i
do
understand
just
then
a
long
rolling
rang
out
just
over
their
heads
there
another
one
of
them
chuckled
jenny
that
downy
the
smallest
of
the
whole
family
he
certainly
makes
an
awful
racket
for
such
a
little
fellow
he
is
a
splendid
drummer
and
he
just
as
good
a
carpenter
he
made
the
very
house
i
am
occupying
peter
was
sitting
with
his
head
tipped
back
trying
to
see
downy
at
first
he
could
make
him
out
then
he
caught
a
little
movement
on
top
of
a
dead
limb
it
was
downy
head
flying
back
and
forth
as
he
beat
his
long
roll
he
was
dressed
all
in
black
and
white
on
the
back
of
his
head
was
a
little
scarlet
patch
he
was
making
a
tremendous
racket
for
such
a
little
chap
only
a
little
bigger
than
one
of
the
sparrow
family
is
he
making
a
hole
for
a
nest
up
there
asked
peter
eagerly
gracious
peter
what
a
question
what
a
perfectly
silly
question
exclaimed
jenny
wren
scornfully
do
give
us
birds
credit
for
a
little
common
sense
if
he
were
cutting
a
hole
for
a
nest
everybody
within
hearing
would
know
just
where
to
look
for
it
downy
has
too
much
sense
in
that
little
head
of
his
to
do
such
a
silly
thing
as
that
when
he
cuts
a
hole
for
a
nest
he
does
make
any
more
noise
than
is
absolutely
necessary
you
do
see
any
chips
flying
do
you
replied
peter
slowly
now
you
speak
of
it
i
do
is
is
he
hunting
for
worms
in
the
wood
jenny
laughed
right
out
hardly
peter
hardly
said
she
he
just
drumming
that
all
that
hollow
limb
makes
the
best
kind
of
a
drum
and
downy
is
making
the
most
of
it
just
listen
to
that
there
is
a
better
drummer
but
peter
was
satisfied
finally
he
ventured
another
question
what
he
doing
it
for
good
land
peter
cried
jenny
what
do
you
run
and
jump
for
in
the
spring
what
is
wren
singing
for
over
there
downy
is
drumming
for
precisely
the
same
reason
happiness
he
ca
run
and
jump
and
he
sing
but
he
can
drum
by
the
way
do
you
know
that
downy
is
one
of
the
most
useful
birds
in
the
old
orchard
just
then
downy
flew
away
but
hardly
had
he
disappeared
when
another
drummer
took
his
place
at
first
peter
thought
downy
had
returned
until
he
noticed
that
the
newcomer
was
just
a
bit
bigger
than
downy
jenny
wren
sharp
eyes
spied
him
at
once
hello
she
exclaimed
there
hairy
did
you
ever
see
two
cousins
look
more
alike
if
it
were
not
that
hairy
is
bigger
than
downy
it
would
be
hard
work
to
tell
them
apart
do
you
see
any
other
difference
peter
peter
stared
and
blinked
and
stared
again
then
slowly
shook
his
head
no
he
confessed
i
that
shows
you
have
learned
to
use
your
eyes
peter
said
jenny
rather
sharply
look
at
the
outside
feathers
of
his
tail
they
are
all
white
downy
outside
tail
feathers
have
little
bars
of
black
hairy
is
just
as
good
a
carpenter
as
is
downy
but
for
that
matter
i
do
know
of
a
member
of
the
woodpecker
family
who
is
a
good
carpenter
where
did
you
say
yellow
wing
the
flicker
is
making
his
home
this
year
over
in
the
big
by
the
smiling
pool
replied
peter
i
do
understand
yet
why
yellow
wing
spends
so
much
time
on
the
ants
replied
jenny
wren
just
ants
he
as
fond
of
ants
as
is
old
toad
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
if
yellow
wing
keeps
on
become
a
ground
bird
instead
of
a
tree
bird
he
gets
more
than
half
his
living
on
the
ground
now
speaking
of
drumming
did
you
ever
hear
yellow
wing
drum
on
a
tin
roof
peter
shook
his
head
well
if
there
a
tin
roof
anywhere
around
and
yellow
wing
can
find
it
he
will
be
perfectly
happy
he
certainly
does
love
to
make
a
noise
and
tin
makes
the
finest
kind
of
a
just
then
jenny
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
on
the
trunk
of
the
very
next
tree
to
the
one
on
which
she
was
sitting
of
a
bird
about
the
size
of
sammy
jay
his
whole
head
and
neck
were
a
beautiful
deep
red
his
breast
was
pure
white
and
his
back
was
black
to
nearly
the
beginning
of
his
tail
where
it
was
white
hello
redhead
exclaimed
jenny
wren
how
did
you
know
we
were
talking
about
your
family
hello
chatterbox
retorted
redhead
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
did
know
you
were
talking
about
my
family
but
i
could
have
guessed
that
you
were
talking
about
some
one
family
does
your
tongue
ever
stop
jenny
jenny
wren
started
to
become
indignant
and
scold
then
thought
better
of
it
i
was
talking
for
peter
benefit
said
she
trying
to
look
dignified
a
thing
quite
impossible
for
any
member
of
the
wren
family
to
do
peter
has
always
had
the
idea
that
true
woodpeckers
never
go
down
on
the
ground
i
was
explaining
to
him
that
yellow
wing
is
a
true
woodpecker
yet
spends
half
his
time
on
the
redhead
nodded
it
all
on
account
of
ants
said
he
i
do
know
of
any
one
quite
so
fond
of
ants
unless
it
is
old
toad
i
like
a
few
of
them
myself
but
yellow
wing
just
about
lives
on
them
when
he
can
you
may
have
noticed
that
i
go
down
on
the
ground
myself
once
in
a
while
i
am
rather
fond
of
beetles
and
an
occasional
grasshopper
tastes
very
good
to
me
i
like
a
variety
yes
sir
i
certainly
do
like
a
variety
cherries
blackberries
raspberries
strawberries
grapes
in
fact
most
kinds
of
fruit
taste
good
to
me
not
to
mention
beechnuts
and
acorns
when
there
is
no
jenny
wren
tossed
her
head
you
did
mention
the
eggs
of
some
of
your
neighbors
said
she
sharply
redhead
did
his
best
to
look
innocent
but
peter
noticed
that
he
gave
a
guilty
start
and
very
abruptly
changed
the
subject
and
a
moment
later
flew
away
is
it
true
asked
peter
that
redhead
does
such
a
dreadful
thing
jenny
bobbed
her
head
rapidly
and
jerked
her
tail
so
i
an
told
said
she
i
never
seen
him
do
it
but
i
know
others
who
have
they
say
he
is
no
better
than
sammy
jay
or
blacky
the
crow
but
gracious
goodness
i
ca
sit
here
gossiping
jenny
twitched
her
funny
little
tail
snapped
her
bright
eyes
at
peter
and
disappeared
in
her
house
chapter
xii
some
unlikely
relatives
having
other
things
to
attend
to
or
rather
having
other
things
to
arouse
his
curiosity
peter
rabbit
did
not
visit
the
old
orchard
for
several
days
when
he
did
it
was
to
find
the
entire
neighborhood
quite
upset
there
was
an
indignation
meeting
in
progress
in
and
around
the
tree
in
which
chebec
and
his
modest
little
wife
had
their
home
how
the
tongues
did
clatter
peter
knew
that
something
had
happened
but
though
he
listened
with
all
his
might
he
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
finally
peter
managed
to
get
the
attention
of
jenny
wren
happened
demanded
peter
what
all
this
fuss
about
jenny
wren
was
so
excited
that
she
could
keep
still
an
instant
her
sharp
little
eyes
snapped
and
her
tail
was
carried
higher
than
ever
it
a
disgrace
it
a
disgrace
to
the
whole
feathered
race
and
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
sputtered
jenny
i
ashamed
to
think
that
such
a
contemptible
creature
wears
feathers
i
am
so
but
what
it
all
about
demanded
peter
impatiently
do
keep
still
long
enough
to
tell
me
who
is
this
contemptible
creature
sally
sly
snapped
jenny
wren
sally
sly
the
cowbird
i
hoped
she
would
disgrace
the
old
orchard
this
year
but
she
has
when
and
chebec
returned
from
getting
their
breakfast
this
morning
they
found
one
of
sally
sly
eggs
in
their
nest
they
are
terribly
upset
and
i
do
blame
them
if
i
were
in
their
place
i
simply
would
throw
that
egg
out
that
what
i
do
i
throw
that
egg
out
peter
was
puzzled
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
stroked
his
whiskers
as
he
tried
to
understand
what
it
all
meant
who
is
sally
sly
and
what
did
she
do
that
for
he
finally
ventured
for
goodness
sake
peter
rabbit
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
know
who
sally
sly
is
then
without
waiting
for
peter
to
reply
jenny
rattled
on
she
a
member
of
the
blackbird
family
and
she
the
laziest
most
sneakiest
most
unfeeling
and
most
selfish
wretch
i
know
of
jenny
paused
long
enough
to
get
her
breath
she
laid
that
egg
in
chebec
nest
because
she
is
too
lazy
to
build
a
nest
of
her
own
and
too
selfish
to
take
care
of
her
own
children
do
you
know
what
will
happen
peter
rabbit
do
you
know
what
will
happen
peter
shook
his
head
and
confessed
that
he
did
when
that
egg
hatches
out
that
young
cowbird
will
be
about
twice
as
big
as
own
children
sputtered
jenny
he
be
so
big
that
he
get
most
of
the
food
he
just
rob
those
little
chebecs
in
spite
of
all
their
mother
and
father
can
do
and
chebec
and
his
wife
will
be
just
enough
to
work
themselves
to
skin
and
bone
to
feed
the
young
wretch
because
he
is
an
orphan
and
has
anybody
to
look
after
him
the
worst
of
it
is
sally
sly
is
likely
to
play
the
same
trick
on
others
she
always
chooses
the
nest
of
some
one
smaller
than
herself
she
terribly
sly
no
one
has
seen
her
about
she
just
sneaked
into
the
old
orchard
this
morning
when
everybody
was
busy
laid
that
egg
and
sneaked
out
did
you
say
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
blackbird
family
asked
peter
jenny
wren
nodded
vigorously
that
what
she
is
said
she
thank
goodness
she
is
a
member
of
my
family
if
she
were
i
never
would
be
able
to
hold
my
head
up
just
listen
to
goldy
the
oriole
over
in
that
big
elm
i
do
see
how
he
can
sing
like
that
knowing
that
one
of
his
relatives
has
just
done
such
a
shameful
deed
it
a
queer
thing
that
there
can
be
two
members
of
the
same
family
so
unlike
goldy
builds
one
of
the
most
wonderful
nests
of
any
one
i
know
and
sally
sly
is
too
lazy
to
build
any
if
i
were
in
goldy
place
i
hold
on
cried
peter
i
thought
you
said
sally
sly
is
a
member
of
the
blackbird
family
i
do
see
what
she
got
to
do
with
goldy
the
you
do
eh
exclaimed
jenny
well
for
one
who
pokes
into
other
people
affairs
as
you
do
you
do
know
much
the
orioles
and
the
meadow
larks
and
the
grackles
and
the
bobolinks
all
belong
to
the
blackbird
family
they
all
related
to
redwing
the
blackbird
and
sally
sly
the
cowbird
belongs
in
the
same
peter
gasped
i
i
had
the
least
idea
that
any
of
these
folks
were
related
stammered
peter
well
they
are
retorted
jenny
wren
as
i
live
there
sally
sly
now
peter
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
bird
who
reminded
him
somewhat
of
redwing
she
was
about
the
same
size
and
looked
very
much
like
her
it
was
plain
that
she
was
trying
to
keep
out
of
sight
and
the
instant
she
knew
that
she
had
been
discovered
she
flew
away
in
the
direction
of
the
old
pasture
it
happened
that
late
that
afternoon
peter
visited
the
old
pasture
and
saw
her
again
she
and
some
of
her
friends
were
busily
walking
about
close
to
the
feet
of
the
cows
where
they
seemed
to
be
picking
up
food
one
had
a
brown
head
neck
and
breast
the
rest
of
his
coat
was
glossy
black
peter
rightly
guessed
that
this
must
be
cowbird
seeing
them
on
such
good
terms
with
the
cows
he
understood
why
they
are
called
cowbirds
sure
that
sally
sly
had
left
the
old
orchard
the
feathered
folks
settled
down
to
their
personal
affairs
and
household
cares
jenny
wren
among
them
having
no
one
to
talk
to
peter
found
a
shady
place
close
to
the
old
stone
wall
and
there
sat
down
to
think
over
the
surprising
things
he
had
learned
presently
goldy
the
baltimore
oriole
alighted
in
the
nearest
and
it
seemed
to
peter
that
never
had
he
seen
any
one
more
beautifully
dressed
his
head
neck
throat
and
upper
part
of
his
back
were
black
the
lower
part
of
his
back
and
his
breast
were
a
beautiful
deep
orange
color
there
was
a
dash
of
orange
on
his
shoulders
but
the
rest
of
his
wings
were
black
with
an
edging
of
white
his
tail
was
black
and
orange
peter
had
heard
him
called
the
firebird
and
now
he
understood
why
his
song
was
quite
as
rich
and
beautiful
as
his
coat
shortly
he
was
joined
by
goldy
compared
with
her
handsome
husband
she
was
very
modestly
dressed
she
wore
more
brown
than
black
and
where
the
orange
color
appeared
it
was
rather
dull
she
wasted
no
time
in
singing
almost
instantly
her
sharp
eyes
spied
a
piece
of
string
caught
in
the
bushes
almost
over
peter
head
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
she
flew
down
and
seized
it
but
the
string
was
caught
and
though
she
tugged
and
pulled
with
all
her
might
she
could
get
it
free
goldy
saw
the
trouble
she
was
having
and
cutting
his
song
short
flew
down
to
help
her
together
they
pulled
and
tugged
and
tugged
and
pulled
until
they
had
to
stop
to
rest
and
get
their
breath
we
simply
must
have
this
piece
of
string
said
goldy
i
been
hunting
everywhere
for
a
piece
and
this
is
the
first
i
found
it
is
just
what
we
need
to
bind
our
nest
fast
to
the
twigs
with
this
i
have
the
least
bit
of
fear
that
that
nest
will
ever
tear
loose
no
matter
how
hard
the
wind
once
more
they
tugged
and
pulled
and
pulled
and
tugged
until
at
last
they
got
it
free
and
goldy
flew
away
in
triumph
with
the
string
in
her
bill
goldy
himself
followed
peter
watched
them
fly
to
the
top
of
a
long
swaying
branch
of
a
big
up
near
farmer
brown
house
he
could
see
something
which
looked
like
a
bag
hanging
there
and
he
knew
that
this
must
be
the
nest
gracious
said
peter
they
must
get
terribly
tossed
about
when
the
wind
blows
i
should
think
their
babies
would
be
thrown
do
you
worry
about
them
said
a
voice
peter
looked
up
to
find
welcome
robin
just
over
him
mrs
goldy
makes
one
of
the
most
wonderful
nests
i
know
of
continued
welcome
robin
it
is
like
a
deep
pocket
made
of
grass
string
hair
and
bark
all
woven
together
like
a
piece
of
cloth
it
is
so
deep
that
it
is
quite
safe
for
the
babies
and
they
seem
to
enjoy
being
rocked
by
the
wind
i
care
for
it
myself
because
i
like
a
solid
foundation
for
my
home
but
the
goldies
like
it
it
looks
dangerous
but
it
really
is
one
of
the
safest
nests
i
know
of
snakes
and
cats
never
get
up
there
and
there
are
few
feathered
who
can
get
at
those
eggs
so
deep
down
in
the
nest
goldy
is
sometimes
called
golden
robin
he
is
a
robin
at
all
but
i
would
feel
very
proud
if
he
were
a
member
of
my
family
he
just
as
useful
as
he
is
handsome
and
that
saying
a
great
deal
he
just
dotes
on
caterpillars
there
robin
calling
me
with
this
welcome
robin
flew
away
and
peter
once
more
settled
himself
to
think
over
all
he
had
learned
chapter
xiii
more
of
the
blackbird
family
peter
rabbit
was
dozing
yes
sir
peter
was
dozing
he
did
mean
to
doze
but
whenever
peter
sits
still
for
a
long
time
and
tries
to
think
he
is
pretty
sure
to
go
to
sleep
by
and
by
he
wakened
with
a
start
at
first
he
did
know
what
had
wakened
him
but
as
he
sat
there
blinking
his
eyes
he
heard
a
few
rich
notes
from
the
top
of
the
nearest
it
goldy
the
oriole
thought
peter
and
peeped
out
to
see
but
though
he
looked
and
looked
he
could
see
goldy
anywhere
but
he
did
see
a
stranger
it
was
some
one
of
about
goldy
size
and
shape
in
fact
he
was
so
like
goldy
but
for
the
color
of
his
suit
that
at
first
peter
almost
thought
goldy
had
somehow
changed
his
clothes
of
course
he
knew
that
this
could
be
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
for
the
song
the
stranger
was
singing
was
something
like
that
of
goldy
the
stranger
head
and
throat
and
back
were
black
just
like
goldy
and
his
wings
were
trimmed
with
white
in
just
the
same
way
but
the
rest
of
his
suit
instead
of
being
the
beautiful
orange
of
which
goldy
is
so
proud
was
a
beautiful
chestnut
color
peter
blinked
and
stared
very
hard
now
who
can
this
be
said
he
speaking
aloud
without
thinking
do
you
know
him
asked
a
sharp
voice
so
close
to
peter
that
it
made
him
jump
peter
whirled
around
there
sat
striped
chipmunk
grinning
at
him
from
the
top
of
the
old
stone
wall
that
weaver
the
orchard
oriole
striped
chipmunk
rattled
on
if
you
do
know
him
you
ought
to
because
he
is
one
of
the
very
nicest
persons
in
the
old
orchard
i
just
love
to
hear
him
is
is
he
related
to
goldy
asked
peter
somewhat
doubtfully
of
course
retorted
striped
chipmunk
i
should
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
him
more
than
once
to
know
that
he
first
cousin
to
goldy
there
comes
weaver
i
do
hope
they
decided
to
build
in
the
old
orchard
this
i
glad
you
told
me
who
she
is
because
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
confessed
peter
as
he
studied
the
newcomer
she
did
not
look
at
all
like
weaver
she
was
dressed
in
and
dull
yellow
with
white
markings
on
her
wings
peter
could
help
thinking
how
much
easier
it
must
be
for
her
than
for
her
handsome
husband
to
hide
among
the
green
leaves
as
he
watched
she
flew
down
to
the
ground
and
picked
up
a
long
piece
of
grass
they
are
building
here
as
sure
as
you
live
cried
striped
chipmunk
i
glad
of
that
did
you
ever
see
their
nest
peter
of
course
you
have
because
you
said
you
had
never
seen
them
before
their
nest
is
a
wonder
peter
it
really
is
it
is
made
almost
wholly
of
fine
grass
and
they
weave
it
together
in
the
most
wonderful
do
they
have
a
hanging
nest
like
goldy
asked
peter
a
bit
timidly
not
such
a
deep
one
replied
striped
chipmunk
they
hang
it
between
the
twigs
near
the
end
of
a
branch
but
they
bind
it
more
closely
to
the
branch
and
it
is
deep
enough
to
swing
as
goldy
peter
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
another
question
when
there
was
a
loud
sniffing
sound
farther
up
along
the
old
stone
wall
he
did
wait
to
hear
it
again
he
knew
that
bowser
the
hound
was
coming
striped
chipmunk
this
is
no
place
for
me
whispered
peter
and
started
for
the
dear
old
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
there
that
on
his
way
across
the
green
meadows
he
almost
ran
into
jimmy
skunk
before
he
saw
him
what
your
hurry
peter
demanded
jimmy
bowser
the
hound
almost
found
me
up
in
the
old
orchard
panted
peter
it
a
wonder
he
has
found
my
tracks
i
expect
he
will
any
minute
i
glad
to
see
you
jimmy
but
i
guess
i
better
be
moving
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
peter
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
replied
jimmy
who
himself
never
hurries
stop
and
talk
a
bit
that
old
nuisance
wo
bother
you
as
long
as
you
are
with
peter
hesitated
he
wanted
to
gossip
but
he
still
felt
nervous
about
bowser
the
hound
however
as
he
heard
nothing
of
bowser
great
voice
telling
all
the
world
that
he
had
found
peter
tracks
he
decided
to
stop
a
few
minutes
what
are
you
doing
down
here
on
the
green
meadows
he
demanded
jimmy
grinned
i
looking
for
grasshoppers
and
grubs
if
you
must
know
said
he
and
i
just
got
a
notion
i
may
find
some
fresh
eggs
i
do
often
eat
them
but
once
in
a
while
one
tastes
if
you
ask
me
it
a
funny
place
to
be
looking
for
eggs
down
here
on
the
green
meadows
replied
peter
when
i
want
a
thing
i
look
for
it
where
it
is
likely
to
be
just
so
peter
just
so
retorted
jimmy
skunk
nodding
his
head
with
approval
that
why
i
am
peter
looked
puzzled
he
was
puzzled
but
before
he
could
ask
another
question
a
rollicking
song
caused
both
of
them
to
look
up
there
on
quivering
wings
in
was
the
singer
he
was
dressed
very
much
like
jimmy
skunk
himself
in
black
and
white
save
that
in
places
the
white
had
a
tinge
of
yellow
especially
on
the
back
of
his
neck
it
was
bubbling
bob
the
bobolink
and
how
he
did
sing
it
seemed
as
if
the
notes
fairly
tumbled
over
each
other
jimmy
skunk
raised
himself
on
his
a
little
to
see
just
where
bubbling
bob
dropped
down
in
the
grass
then
jimmy
began
to
move
in
that
direction
suddenly
peter
understood
he
remembered
that
bubbling
nest
is
always
on
the
ground
it
was
his
eggs
that
jimmy
skunk
was
looking
for
you
do
happen
to
have
seen
bob
anywhere
around
here
do
you
peter
asked
jimmy
trying
to
speak
carelessly
no
replied
peter
if
i
had
i
would
tell
you
where
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
jimmy
skunk
to
think
of
robbing
such
a
beautiful
singer
as
bubbling
pooh
retorted
jimmy
what
the
harm
if
i
find
those
eggs
he
and
bob
could
simply
build
another
nest
and
lay
some
more
they
be
any
the
worse
off
and
i
will
have
had
a
good
but
think
of
all
the
work
they
would
have
to
do
to
build
another
nest
replied
peter
i
should
worry
retorted
jimmy
skunk
any
one
who
can
spend
so
much
time
singing
can
afford
to
do
a
little
extra
you
horrid
jimmy
skunk
you
just
horrid
said
peter
i
hope
you
wo
find
a
single
egg
so
there
with
this
peter
once
more
headed
for
the
dear
old
while
jimmy
skunk
continued
toward
the
place
where
bubbling
bob
had
disappeared
in
the
long
grass
peter
went
only
a
short
distance
and
then
sat
up
to
watch
jimmy
skunk
just
before
jimmy
reached
the
place
where
bubbling
bob
had
disappeared
the
latter
mounted
into
the
air
again
pouring
out
his
rollicking
song
as
if
there
were
no
room
in
his
heart
for
anything
but
happiness
then
he
saw
jimmy
shrunk
and
became
very
much
excited
he
flew
down
in
the
grass
a
little
farther
on
and
then
up
again
and
began
to
scold
it
looked
very
much
as
if
he
had
gone
down
in
the
grass
to
warn
bob
evidently
jimmy
thought
so
for
he
at
once
headed
that
way
when
bubbling
bob
did
the
same
thing
all
over
again
peter
grew
anxious
he
knew
just
how
patient
jimmy
skunk
could
be
and
he
very
much
feared
that
jimmy
would
find
that
nest
presently
he
grew
tired
of
watching
and
started
on
for
the
dear
old
just
before
he
reached
it
a
brown
bird
who
reminded
him
somewhat
of
redwing
and
sally
sly
the
cowbird
though
she
was
smaller
ran
across
the
path
in
front
of
him
and
then
flew
up
to
the
top
of
a
last
year
mullein
stalk
it
was
bobolink
peter
knew
her
well
for
he
and
she
were
very
good
friends
oh
cried
peter
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
know
that
jimmy
skunk
is
hunting
for
your
nest
over
there
are
you
worried
to
death
i
would
be
if
i
were
in
your
bob
chuckled
is
he
a
dear
and
is
he
smart
said
she
meaning
bubbling
bob
of
course
and
not
jimmy
skunk
just
see
him
lead
that
robber
peter
stared
at
her
for
a
full
minute
do
you
mean
to
say
said
he
that
your
nest
is
over
there
at
all
bob
chuckled
harder
than
ever
of
course
it
is
over
there
said
she
then
where
is
it
demanded
peter
that
telling
replied
bob
it
is
over
there
and
it
anywhere
near
there
but
where
it
is
is
bob
secret
and
mine
and
we
mean
to
keep
it
now
i
must
go
get
something
to
eat
and
with
a
hasty
farewell
bobolink
flew
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
dear
old
peter
remembered
that
he
had
seen
bob
running
along
the
ground
before
she
flew
up
to
the
old
mullein
stalk
he
went
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
first
seen
her
and
hunted
all
around
in
the
grass
but
without
success
you
see
bobolink
had
been
quite
as
clever
in
fooling
peter
as
bubbling
bob
had
been
in
fooling
jimmy
skunk
chapter
xiv
bob
white
and
carol
the
meadow
lark
bob
bob
white
bob
bob
white
bob
bob
white
clear
and
sweet
that
call
floated
over
to
the
dear
old
until
peter
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
felt
that
he
just
had
to
go
over
and
pay
an
early
morning
call
on
one
of
his
very
best
friends
who
at
this
season
of
the
year
delights
in
whistling
his
own
name
bob
white
i
suppose
muttered
peter
that
bob
white
has
got
a
nest
i
wish
he
would
show
it
to
me
he
terribly
secretive
about
it
last
year
i
hunted
for
his
nest
until
my
feet
were
sore
but
it
was
the
least
bit
of
use
then
one
morning
i
met
bob
white
with
fifteen
babies
out
for
a
walk
how
she
could
hide
a
nest
with
fifteen
eggs
in
it
is
more
than
i
can
peter
left
the
old
and
started
off
over
the
green
meadows
towards
the
old
pasture
as
he
drew
near
the
fence
between
the
green
meadows
and
the
old
pasture
he
saw
bob
white
sitting
on
one
of
the
posts
whistling
with
all
his
might
on
another
post
near
him
sat
another
bird
very
near
the
size
of
welcome
robin
he
also
was
telling
all
the
world
of
his
happiness
it
was
carol
the
meadow
lark
peter
was
so
intent
watching
these
two
friends
of
his
that
he
took
no
heed
to
his
footsteps
suddenly
there
was
a
whirr
from
almost
under
his
very
nose
and
he
stopped
short
so
startled
that
he
almost
squealed
right
out
in
a
second
he
recognized
meadow
lark
he
watched
her
fly
over
to
where
carol
was
singing
her
stout
little
wings
moved
swiftly
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
sailed
on
without
moving
them
at
all
then
they
fluttered
rapidly
again
until
she
was
flying
fast
enough
to
once
more
sail
on
them
outstretched
the
white
outer
feathers
of
her
tail
showed
clearly
and
reminded
peter
of
the
tail
of
sweetvoice
the
vesper
sparrow
only
of
course
it
was
ever
so
much
bigger
peter
sat
still
until
meadow
lark
had
alighted
on
the
fence
near
carol
then
he
prepared
to
hurry
on
for
he
was
anxious
for
a
bit
of
gossip
with
these
good
friends
of
his
but
just
before
he
did
this
he
just
happened
to
glance
down
and
there
almost
at
his
very
feet
he
caught
sight
of
something
that
made
him
squeal
right
out
it
was
a
nest
with
four
of
the
prettiest
eggs
peter
ever
had
seen
they
were
white
with
brown
spots
all
over
them
had
it
not
been
for
the
eggs
he
never
would
have
seen
that
nest
never
in
the
world
it
was
made
of
dry
brown
grass
and
was
cunningly
hidden
is
a
little
clump
of
dead
grass
which
fell
over
it
so
as
to
almost
completely
hide
it
but
the
thing
that
surprised
peter
most
was
the
clever
way
in
which
the
approach
to
it
was
hidden
it
was
by
means
of
a
regular
little
tunnel
of
grass
oh
cried
peter
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
this
must
be
the
nest
of
meadow
lark
no
wonder
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
it
when
i
have
looked
for
it
it
is
just
luck
and
nothing
else
that
i
have
found
it
this
time
i
think
it
is
perfectly
wonderful
that
meadow
lark
can
hide
her
home
in
such
a
way
i
do
hope
jimmy
skunk
anywhere
peter
sat
up
straight
and
anxiously
looked
this
way
and
that
way
jimmy
skunk
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
peter
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
very
carefully
he
walked
around
that
nest
and
its
little
tunnel
then
hurried
over
toward
the
fence
as
fast
as
he
could
go
it
perfectly
beautiful
carol
he
cried
just
as
soon
as
he
was
near
enough
and
i
wo
tell
a
single
soul
i
hope
not
i
certainly
hope
not
cried
meadow
lark
in
an
anxious
tone
i
never
would
have
another
single
easy
minute
if
i
thought
you
would
tell
a
living
soul
about
my
nest
promise
that
you
wo
peter
cross
your
heart
and
promise
that
you
peter
promptly
crossed
his
heart
and
promised
that
he
would
tell
a
single
soul
meadow
lark
seemed
to
feel
better
right
away
she
flew
back
and
peter
turned
to
watch
her
he
saw
her
disappear
in
the
grass
but
it
was
where
he
had
found
the
nest
peter
waited
a
few
minutes
thinking
that
he
would
see
her
rise
into
the
air
again
and
fly
over
to
the
nest
but
he
waited
in
vain
then
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
he
turned
to
look
up
at
carol
carol
eyes
twinkled
i
know
what
you
thinking
peter
he
chuckled
you
are
thinking
that
it
is
funny
meadow
lark
did
go
straight
hack
to
our
nest
when
she
seemed
so
anxious
about
it
i
would
have
you
to
know
that
she
is
too
clever
to
do
anything
so
foolish
as
that
she
knows
well
enough
that
somebody
might
see
her
and
so
find
our
secret
she
has
walked
there
from
the
place
where
you
saw
her
disappear
in
the
grass
that
is
the
way
we
always
do
when
we
go
to
our
nest
one
never
can
be
too
careful
these
then
carol
began
to
pour
out
his
happiness
once
more
quite
as
if
nothing
had
interrupted
his
song
somehow
peter
never
before
had
realized
how
handsome
carol
the
meadow
lark
was
as
he
faced
peter
the
latter
saw
a
beautiful
yellow
throat
and
waistcoat
with
a
broad
black
crescent
on
his
breast
there
was
a
yellow
line
above
each
eye
his
back
was
of
brown
with
black
markings
his
sides
were
whitish
with
spats
and
streaks
of
black
the
outer
edges
of
his
tail
were
white
altogether
he
was
really
handsome
far
handsomer
than
one
would
suspect
seeing
him
at
a
distance
having
found
out
carol
secret
peter
was
doubly
anxious
to
find
bob
white
home
so
he
hurried
over
to
the
post
where
bob
was
whistling
with
all
his
might
bob
cried
peter
i
just
found
carol
nest
and
i
promised
to
keep
it
a
secret
wo
you
show
me
your
nest
too
if
i
promise
to
keep
that
a
secret
rob
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
joyously
you
ought
to
know
peter
by
this
time
said
he
that
there
are
secrets
never
to
be
told
to
anybody
my
nest
is
one
of
these
if
you
find
it
all
right
but
i
would
show
it
to
my
very
best
friend
and
i
guess
i
have
any
better
friend
than
you
then
from
sheer
happiness
he
whistled
bob
white
bob
bob
white
with
all
his
might
peter
was
disappointed
and
a
little
put
out
i
guess
said
he
i
could
find
it
if
i
wanted
to
i
guess
it
is
any
better
hidden
than
meadow
lark
and
i
found
that
some
folks
are
as
smart
as
they
think
they
bob
white
who
is
sometimes
called
quail
and
sometimes
called
partridge
and
who
is
neither
chuckled
heartily
go
ahead
old
mr
curiosity
go
ahead
and
hunt
all
you
please
said
he
it
funny
to
me
how
some
folks
think
themselves
smart
when
the
truth
is
they
simply
have
been
lucky
you
know
well
enough
that
you
just
happened
to
find
carol
nest
if
you
happen
to
find
mine
i
wo
have
a
word
to
bob
white
took
a
long
breath
tipped
his
head
back
until
his
bill
was
pointing
right
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
and
with
all
his
might
whistled
his
name
bob
bob
white
bob
bob
white
as
peter
looked
at
him
it
came
over
him
that
bob
white
was
the
plumpest
bird
of
his
acquaintance
he
was
so
plump
that
his
body
seemed
almost
round
the
shortness
of
his
tail
added
to
this
effect
for
bob
has
a
very
short
tail
the
upper
part
of
his
coat
was
a
handsome
with
dark
streaks
and
light
edgings
his
sides
and
the
upper
part
of
his
breast
were
of
the
same
handsome
while
underneath
he
was
whitish
with
little
bars
of
black
his
throat
was
white
and
above
each
eye
was
a
broad
white
stripe
his
white
throat
was
bordered
with
black
and
a
band
of
black
divided
the
throat
from
the
white
line
above
each
eye
the
top
of
his
head
was
mixed
black
and
brown
altogether
he
was
a
handsome
little
fellow
in
a
modest
way
suddenly
bob
white
stopped
whistling
and
looked
down
at
peter
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
why
do
you
go
hunt
for
that
nest
peter
said
he
i
going
replied
peter
rather
shortly
for
he
knew
that
bob
knew
that
he
had
the
least
idea
where
to
look
it
might
be
somewhere
on
the
green
meadows
or
it
might
be
in
the
old
pasture
bob
had
given
the
least
hint
peter
had
a
feeling
that
the
nest
was
far
away
and
that
it
was
on
the
green
meadows
so
he
began
to
hunt
running
aimlessly
this
way
and
that
way
all
the
time
feeling
very
foolish
for
of
course
he
knew
that
bob
white
was
watching
him
and
chuckling
down
inside
it
was
very
warm
down
there
on
the
green
meadows
and
peter
grew
hot
and
tired
he
decided
to
run
up
in
the
old
pasture
in
the
shade
of
an
old
there
just
the
other
side
of
the
fence
was
a
path
made
by
the
cows
and
often
used
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
reddy
fox
and
others
who
visited
the
old
pasture
along
this
peter
scampered
on
his
way
to
the
he
did
look
either
to
right
or
left
it
did
occur
to
him
that
there
would
be
any
use
at
all
for
of
course
no
one
would
build
a
nest
near
a
path
where
people
passed
to
and
fro
every
day
and
so
it
was
that
in
his
way
peter
scampered
right
past
a
clump
of
tall
weeds
close
beside
the
path
without
the
least
suspicion
that
cleverly
hidden
in
it
was
the
very
thing
he
was
looking
for
with
laughter
in
her
eyes
shrewd
little
bob
white
with
sixteen
white
eggs
under
her
watched
him
pass
she
had
chosen
that
very
place
for
her
nest
because
she
knew
that
it
was
the
last
place
anyone
would
expect
to
find
it
the
very
fact
that
it
seemed
the
most
dangerous
place
she
could
have
chosen
made
it
the
safest
chapter
xv
a
swallow
and
one
who
is
johnny
and
polly
chuck
had
made
their
home
between
the
roots
of
an
old
in
the
far
corner
of
the
old
orchard
you
know
they
have
their
bedroom
way
down
in
the
ground
and
it
is
reached
by
a
long
hall
they
had
dug
their
home
between
the
roots
of
that
old
because
they
had
discovered
that
there
was
just
room
enough
between
those
spreading
roots
for
them
to
pass
in
and
out
and
there
was
room
to
dig
the
entrance
any
larger
so
they
felt
quite
safe
from
reddy
fox
and
bowser
the
hound
either
of
whom
would
have
delighted
to
dig
them
out
but
for
those
roots
right
in
front
of
their
doorway
was
a
very
nice
doorstep
of
shining
sand
where
johnny
chuck
delighted
to
sit
when
he
had
a
full
stomach
and
nothing
else
to
do
johnny
nearest
neighbors
had
made
their
home
only
about
five
feet
above
johnny
head
when
he
sat
up
on
his
doorstep
they
were
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
and
his
trim
little
wife
and
the
doorway
of
their
home
was
a
little
round
hole
in
the
trunk
of
that
a
hole
which
had
been
cut
some
years
before
by
one
of
the
woodpeckers
johnny
and
skimmer
were
the
best
of
friends
johnny
used
to
delight
in
watching
skimmer
dart
out
from
beneath
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
wheel
and
turn
and
glide
now
sometimes
high
in
the
blue
blue
sky
and
again
just
skimming
the
tops
of
the
grass
on
wings
which
seemed
never
to
tire
but
he
liked
still
better
the
bits
of
gossip
when
skimmer
would
sit
in
his
doorway
and
chat
about
his
neighbors
of
the
old
orchard
and
his
adventures
out
in
the
great
world
during
his
long
journeys
to
and
from
the
south
to
johnny
chuck
way
of
thinking
there
was
no
one
quite
so
trim
and
neat
appearing
as
skimmer
with
his
snowy
white
breast
and
back
and
wings
two
things
johnny
always
used
to
wonder
at
small
bill
and
short
legs
finally
he
ventured
to
ask
skimmer
about
them
gracious
johnny
exclaimed
skimmer
i
would
have
a
big
bill
for
anything
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
it
would
be
in
the
way
you
see
i
get
nearly
all
my
food
in
the
air
when
i
am
flying
mosquitoes
and
flies
and
all
sorts
of
small
insects
with
wings
i
have
to
pick
them
off
trees
and
bushes
or
from
the
ground
and
so
i
need
any
more
of
a
bill
than
i
have
it
the
same
way
with
my
legs
have
you
ever
seen
me
walking
on
the
ground
johnny
thought
a
moment
no
said
he
now
you
speak
of
it
i
never
and
have
you
ever
seen
me
hopping
about
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
persisted
skimmer
again
johnny
chuck
admitted
that
he
never
had
the
only
use
i
have
for
feet
continued
skimmer
is
for
perching
while
i
rest
i
do
need
long
legs
for
walking
or
hopping
about
so
mother
nature
has
made
my
legs
very
short
you
see
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
i
suppose
it
the
same
with
your
cousin
sooty
the
chimney
swallow
said
johnny
that
shows
just
how
much
some
people
know
twittered
skimmer
indignantly
the
idea
of
calling
sooty
a
swallow
the
very
idea
leave
you
to
know
johnny
chuck
that
sooty
is
even
related
to
me
he
a
swift
and
not
a
he
looks
like
a
swallow
protested
johnny
chuck
he
does
either
you
just
think
he
does
because
he
happens
to
spend
most
of
his
time
in
the
air
the
way
we
swallows
do
sputtered
skimmer
the
swallow
family
never
would
admit
such
a
homely
looking
fellow
as
he
is
as
a
member
tut
tut
tut
tut
i
do
believe
skimmer
is
jealous
cried
jenny
wren
who
had
happened
along
just
in
time
to
hear
skimmer
last
remarks
nothing
of
the
sort
declared
skimmer
growing
still
more
indignant
i
like
to
know
what
there
is
about
sooty
the
chimney
swift
that
could
possibly
make
a
swallow
jenny
wren
cocked
her
tail
up
in
that
saucy
way
of
hers
and
winked
at
johnny
chuck
the
way
he
can
fly
said
she
softly
the
way
he
can
fly
sputtered
skimmer
the
way
he
can
fly
why
there
never
was
a
day
in
his
life
that
he
could
fly
like
a
swallow
there
is
any
one
more
graceful
on
the
wing
than
i
am
if
i
do
say
so
and
there
is
any
one
more
ungraceful
than
just
then
there
was
a
shrill
chatter
overhead
and
all
looked
up
to
see
sooty
the
chimney
swift
racing
through
the
sky
as
if
having
the
very
best
time
in
the
world
his
wings
would
beat
furiously
and
then
he
would
glide
very
much
as
you
or
i
would
on
skates
it
was
quite
true
that
he
was
graceful
but
he
could
twist
and
turn
and
cut
up
all
sorts
of
antics
such
as
skimmer
never
dreamed
of
doing
he
can
use
first
one
wing
and
then
the
other
while
you
have
to
use
both
wings
at
once
persisted
jenny
wren
you
could
to
save
your
life
go
straight
down
into
a
chimney
and
you
know
it
skimmer
he
can
do
things
with
his
wings
which
you
ca
do
nor
any
other
that
may
be
true
but
just
the
same
i
not
the
least
teeny
weeny
bit
jealous
of
him
said
skimmer
and
darted
away
to
get
beyond
the
reach
of
jenny
sharp
tongue
is
it
really
true
that
he
and
sooty
are
not
related
asked
johnny
chuck
as
they
watched
skimmer
cutting
airy
circles
high
up
in
the
slay
jenny
nodded
it
quite
true
johnny
said
site
sooty
belongs
to
another
family
altogether
he
a
funny
fellow
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
such
narrow
wings
and
his
tail
is
hardly
worth
calling
a
johnny
chuck
laughed
way
up
there
in
the
air
he
looks
almost
alike
at
both
ends
said
he
is
he
all
black
he
is
black
at
all
declared
jenny
he
is
rather
grayish
on
the
throat
and
breast
speaking
of
that
tail
of
his
the
feathers
end
in
little
sharp
stiff
points
he
uses
them
in
the
same
way
that
downy
the
woodpecker
uses
his
tail
feathers
when
he
braces
himself
with
them
on
the
trunk
of
a
but
i
never
seen
sooty
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
protested
johnny
chuck
in
fact
i
never
seen
him
anywhere
but
in
the
and
you
never
will
snapped
jenny
the
only
place
he
ever
alights
is
inside
a
chimney
or
inside
a
hollow
tree
there
he
clings
to
the
side
just
as
downy
the
woodpecker
clings
to
the
trunk
of
a
johnny
looked
as
if
he
did
quite
believe
this
if
that
the
case
where
does
he
nest
he
demanded
and
where
does
he
sleep
in
a
chimney
stupid
in
a
chimney
of
course
retorted
jenny
wren
he
fastens
his
nest
right
to
the
inside
of
a
chimney
he
makes
a
regular
little
basket
of
twigs
and
fastens
it
to
the
side
of
the
are
you
trying
to
stuff
me
with
nonsense
asked
johnny
chuck
indignantly
how
can
he
fasten
his
nest
to
the
side
of
a
chimney
unless
there
a
little
shelf
to
put
it
on
and
if
he
never
alights
how
does
he
get
the
little
sticks
to
make
a
nest
of
i
just
like
to
know
how
you
expect
me
to
believe
any
such
story
as
jenny
wren
sharp
little
eyes
snapped
if
you
half
used
your
eyes
you
would
have
to
ask
me
how
he
gets
those
little
sticks
she
sputtered
if
you
had
watched
him
when
he
was
flying
close
to
the
tree
tops
you
would
have
seen
him
clutch
little
dead
twigs
in
his
claws
and
snap
them
off
without
stopping
that
the
way
he
gets
his
little
sticks
smarty
he
fastens
them
together
with
a
sticky
substance
he
has
in
his
mouth
and
he
fastens
the
nest
to
the
side
of
the
chimney
in
the
same
way
you
can
believe
it
or
not
but
it
i
believe
it
jenny
i
believe
it
replied
johnny
chuck
very
humbly
if
you
please
jenny
does
sooty
get
all
his
food
in
the
air
too
of
course
replied
jenny
tartly
he
eats
nothing
but
insects
and
he
catches
them
flying
now
i
must
get
back
to
my
duties
at
just
tell
me
one
more
thing
cried
johnny
chuck
hastily
has
sooty
any
near
relatives
as
most
birds
have
he
has
any
one
nearer
than
some
sort
of
second
cousins
boomer
the
nighthawk
whippoorwill
and
hummer
the
what
cried
johnny
chuck
quite
as
if
he
could
believe
he
had
heard
aright
did
you
say
hummer
the
hummingbird
but
he
got
no
reply
for
jenny
wren
was
already
beyond
hearing
chapter
xvi
a
robber
in
the
old
orchard
i
do
believe
it
muttered
johnny
chuck
out
loud
i
do
believe
jenny
wren
knows
what
she
talking
what
is
it
jenny
wren
has
said
that
you
do
believe
demanded
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
as
he
once
more
settled
himself
in
his
doorway
she
said
that
hummer
the
hummingbird
is
a
sort
of
second
cousin
to
sooty
the
chimney
swift
replied
johnny
chuck
well
it
so
if
you
do
believe
it
declared
skimmer
i
do
see
that
that
is
any
harder
to
believe
than
that
you
are
cousin
to
striped
chipmunk
and
nappy
jack
the
gray
squirrel
to
look
at
you
no
one
would
ever
think
you
are
a
member
of
the
squirrel
family
but
you
must
admit
that
you
johnny
chuck
nodded
his
head
thoughtfully
yes
said
he
i
am
even
if
i
do
look
it
this
is
a
funny
world
is
it
you
ca
always
tell
by
a
person
looks
who
he
may
be
related
to
now
that
i
found
out
that
sooty
is
related
to
you
and
is
related
to
hummer
i
never
dare
guess
again
about
anybody
relatives
i
always
supposed
twitter
the
martin
to
be
a
relative
of
yours
but
now
that
i
learned
that
sooty
is
i
suspect
that
twitter
is
oh
yes
he
is
replied
skimmer
promptly
he
the
largest
of
the
swallow
family
and
we
all
feel
very
proud
of
him
everybody
loves
is
he
as
black
as
he
looks
flying
round
up
in
the
air
asked
johnny
chuck
he
never
comes
down
here
as
you
do
where
a
fellow
can
get
a
good
look
at
yes
replied
skimmer
he
dresses
all
in
black
but
it
is
a
beautiful
and
when
the
sun
shines
on
his
back
it
seems
to
be
almost
purple
that
is
why
some
folks
call
him
the
purple
martin
he
is
one
of
the
most
social
fellows
i
know
of
i
like
a
home
by
myself
such
as
got
here
but
twitter
loves
company
he
likes
to
live
in
an
apartment
house
with
a
lot
of
his
own
kind
that
is
why
he
always
looks
for
one
of
those
houses
with
a
lot
of
rooms
in
it
such
as
farmer
brown
boy
has
put
up
on
the
top
of
that
tall
pole
out
in
his
back
yard
he
pays
for
all
the
trouble
farmer
brown
boy
took
to
put
that
house
up
if
there
is
anybody
who
catches
more
flies
and
winged
insects
than
twitter
i
do
know
who
it
how
about
me
demanded
a
new
voice
as
a
graceful
form
skimmed
over
johnny
chuck
head
and
turning
like
a
flash
came
back
it
was
forktail
the
barn
swallow
the
handsomest
and
one
of
the
most
graceful
of
all
the
swallow
family
he
passed
so
close
to
johnny
that
the
latter
had
a
splendid
chance
to
see
and
admire
his
glistening
back
and
the
beautiful
of
his
forehead
and
throat
with
its
narrow
black
collar
and
the
brown
to
buff
color
of
his
under
parts
but
the
thing
that
was
most
striking
about
him
was
his
tail
which
was
so
deeply
forked
as
to
seem
almost
like
two
tails
i
would
know
him
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
just
by
his
tail
alone
exclaimed
johnny
i
do
know
of
any
other
tail
at
all
like
there
is
any
other
like
it
declared
skimmer
if
twitter
the
martin
is
the
largest
of
our
family
forktail
is
the
how
about
my
usefulness
demanded
forktail
as
he
came
skimming
past
again
cousin
twitter
certainly
does
catch
a
lot
of
flies
and
insects
but
i
willing
to
go
against
him
any
day
to
see
who
can
catch
the
with
this
he
darted
away
watching
him
they
saw
him
alight
on
the
top
of
farmer
brown
barn
it
funny
remarked
johnny
chuck
but
as
long
as
i
known
forktail
and
i
known
him
ever
since
i
was
big
enough
to
know
anybody
i
never
found
out
how
he
builds
his
nest
i
seen
him
skimming
over
the
green
meadows
times
without
number
and
often
he
comes
here
to
the
old
orchard
as
he
did
just
now
but
i
never
seen
him
stop
anywhere
except
over
on
that
that
where
he
nests
chuckled
skimmer
what
cried
johnny
chuck
do
you
mean
to
say
he
nests
on
farmer
brown
barn
no
replied
skimmer
he
nests
in
it
that
why
he
is
called
the
barn
swallow
and
why
you
never
have
seen
his
nest
if
you
just
go
over
to
farmer
brown
barn
and
look
up
in
the
roof
you
see
forktail
nest
there
me
go
over
to
farmer
brown
barn
exclaimed
johnny
chuck
do
you
think
i
crazy
skimmer
chuckled
forktail
is
crazy
said
he
and
he
goes
in
and
out
of
that
barn
all
day
long
i
must
say
i
would
care
to
build
in
such
a
place
myself
but
he
seems
to
like
it
there
one
thing
about
it
his
home
is
warm
and
dry
and
comfortable
no
matter
what
the
weather
is
i
would
trade
with
him
though
no
sir
i
would
trade
with
him
for
anything
give
me
a
hollow
in
a
tree
well
lined
with
feathers
to
a
nest
made
of
mud
and
straw
even
if
it
is
do
you
mean
that
such
a
handsome
fellow
as
forktail
uses
mud
in
his
nest
cried
johnny
skimmer
bobbed
his
head
he
does
just
that
said
he
he
something
like
welcome
robin
in
this
respect
i
but
johnny
chuck
never
knew
what
skimmer
was
going
to
say
next
for
skimmer
happened
at
that
instant
to
glance
up
for
an
instant
he
sat
motionless
with
horror
then
with
a
shriek
he
darted
out
into
the
air
at
the
sound
of
that
shriek
skimmer
who
all
the
time
had
been
sitting
on
her
eggs
inside
the
hollow
of
the
tree
darted
out
of
her
doorway
also
shrieking
for
a
moment
johnny
chuck
could
imagine
what
could
be
the
trouble
then
a
slight
rustling
drew
his
eyes
to
a
crotch
in
the
tree
a
little
above
the
doorway
of
skimmer
home
there
partly
coiled
around
a
branch
with
head
swaying
to
and
fro
eyes
glittering
and
forked
tongue
darting
out
and
in
as
he
tried
to
look
down
into
skimmer
nest
was
blacksnake
it
seemed
to
johnny
as
if
in
a
minute
every
bird
in
the
old
orchard
had
arrived
on
the
scene
such
a
shrieking
and
screaming
as
there
was
first
one
and
then
another
would
dart
at
blacksnake
only
to
lose
courage
at
the
last
second
and
turn
aside
poor
skimmer
and
his
little
wife
were
frantic
they
did
their
utmost
to
distract
blacksnake
attention
darting
almost
into
his
very
face
and
then
away
again
before
he
could
strike
but
blacksnake
knew
that
they
were
powerless
to
hurt
him
and
he
knew
that
there
were
eggs
in
that
nest
there
is
nothing
he
loves
better
than
eggs
unless
it
is
a
meal
of
baby
birds
beyond
hissing
angrily
two
or
three
times
he
paid
no
attention
to
skimmer
or
his
friends
but
continued
to
creep
nearer
the
entrance
to
that
nest
at
last
he
reached
a
position
where
he
could
put
his
head
in
the
doorway
as
he
did
so
skimmer
and
skimmer
each
gave
a
little
cry
of
hopelessness
and
despair
but
no
sooner
had
his
head
disappeared
in
the
hole
in
the
old
than
scrapper
the
kingbird
struck
him
savagely
instantly
blacksnake
withdrew
his
head
hissing
fiercely
and
struck
savagely
at
the
birds
nearest
him
several
times
the
same
thing
happened
no
sooner
would
his
head
disappear
in
that
hole
than
scrapper
or
one
or
the
other
of
skimmer
friends
braver
than
the
rest
would
dart
in
and
peck
at
him
viciously
and
all
the
time
all
the
birds
were
screaming
as
only
excited
feathered
folk
can
johnny
chuck
was
quite
as
excited
as
his
feathered
friends
and
so
intent
watching
the
hated
black
robber
that
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
just
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
and
then
frantically
dived
head
first
down
into
his
hole
he
had
looked
right
up
into
the
eyes
of
farmer
brown
boy
ha
ha
cried
farmer
brown
boy
i
thought
as
much
and
with
a
long
switch
he
struck
blacksnake
just
as
the
latter
had
put
his
head
in
that
doorway
resolved
to
get
those
eggs
this
time
but
when
he
felt
that
switch
and
heard
the
voice
of
farmer
brown
boy
he
changed
his
mind
in
a
flash
he
simply
let
go
his
hold
on
that
tree
and
dropped
the
instant
he
touched
the
ground
he
was
off
like
a
shot
for
the
safety
of
the
old
stone
wall
farmer
brown
boy
after
him
farmer
brown
boy
did
intend
to
kill
blacksnake
but
he
did
want
to
give
him
such
a
fright
that
he
would
visit
the
old
orchard
again
in
a
hurry
and
this
he
quite
succeeded
in
doing
no
sooner
had
blacksnake
disappeared
than
all
the
birds
set
up
such
a
rejoicing
that
you
would
have
thought
they
and
not
farmer
boy
had
saved
the
eggs
of
and
skimmer
listening
to
them
johnny
chuck
just
had
to
smile
chapter
xvii
more
robbers
by
the
sounds
of
rejoicing
among
the
feathered
folks
of
the
old
orchard
johnny
chuck
knew
that
it
was
quite
safe
for
him
to
come
out
he
was
eager
to
tell
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
how
glad
he
was
that
blacksnake
had
been
driven
away
before
he
could
get
skimmer
eggs
as
he
poked
his
head
out
of
his
doorway
he
became
aware
that
something
was
still
wrong
in
the
old
orchard
into
the
glad
chorus
there
broke
a
note
of
distress
and
sorrow
johnny
instantly
recognized
the
voices
of
welcome
robin
and
robin
there
is
not
one
among
his
feathered
neighbors
who
can
so
express
worry
and
sorrow
as
can
the
robins
johnny
was
just
in
time
to
see
all
the
birds
hurrying
over
to
that
part
of
the
old
orchard
where
the
robins
had
built
their
home
the
rejoicing
suddenly
gave
way
to
cries
of
indignation
and
anger
and
johnny
caught
the
words
robber
thief
wretch
it
appeared
that
there
was
just
as
much
excitement
over
there
as
there
had
been
when
blacksnake
had
been
discovered
trying
to
rob
skimmer
and
skimmer
it
could
be
blacksnake
again
because
farmer
brown
boy
had
chased
him
in
quite
another
direction
what
is
it
now
asked
johnny
of
skimmer
who
was
still
excitedly
discussing
with
skimmer
their
recent
fright
i
do
know
but
i
going
to
find
out
replied
skimmer
and
darted
away
johnny
chuck
waited
patiently
the
excitement
among
the
birds
seemed
to
increase
and
the
chattering
and
angry
cries
grew
louder
only
the
voices
of
welcome
and
robin
were
not
angry
they
were
mournful
as
if
welcome
and
robin
were
heartbroken
presently
skimmer
came
back
to
tell
skimmer
the
news
the
robins
have
lost
their
eggs
he
cried
excitedly
all
four
have
been
broken
and
eaten
robin
left
them
to
come
over
here
to
help
drive
away
blacksnake
and
while
she
was
here
some
one
ate
those
eggs
nobody
knows
who
it
could
have
been
because
all
the
birds
of
the
old
orchard
were
over
here
at
that
time
it
might
leave
been
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
or
it
might
have
been
sammy
jay
or
it
might
have
been
creaker
the
grackle
or
it
might
have
been
blacky
the
crow
whoever
it
was
just
took
that
chance
to
sneak
over
there
and
rob
that
nest
when
there
was
no
one
to
see
just
then
from
over
towards
the
green
forest
sounded
a
mocking
caw
caw
caw
instantly
the
noise
in
the
old
orchard
ceased
for
a
moment
then
it
broke
out
afresh
there
was
a
doubt
now
in
any
one
mind
blacky
the
crow
was
the
robber
how
those
tongues
did
go
there
was
nothing
too
bad
to
say
about
blacky
and
such
dreadful
things
as
those
birds
promised
to
do
to
blacky
the
crow
if
ever
they
should
catch
him
in
the
old
orchard
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
from
the
distance
and
his
voice
sounded
very
much
as
if
he
thought
he
had
done
something
very
smart
it
was
quite
clear
that
at
least
he
was
not
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
all
the
birds
were
so
excited
and
so
angry
as
they
gathered
around
welcome
and
robin
trying
to
comfort
them
that
it
was
some
time
before
their
indignation
meeting
broke
up
and
they
returned
to
their
own
homes
and
duties
almost
at
once
there
was
another
cry
of
distress
and
chebec
had
been
robbed
of
their
eggs
while
they
had
been
attending
the
indignation
meeting
at
the
home
of
the
robins
a
thief
had
taken
the
chance
to
steal
their
eggs
and
get
away
of
course
right
away
all
the
birds
hurried
over
to
sympathize
with
the
chebecs
and
to
repeat
against
the
unknown
thief
all
the
threats
they
had
made
against
blacky
the
crow
they
knew
it
could
have
been
blacky
this
time
because
they
had
heard
blacky
cawing
over
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
in
the
midst
of
the
excited
discussion
as
to
who
the
thief
was
weaver
the
orchard
oriole
spied
a
blue
and
white
feather
on
the
ground
just
below
chebec
nest
it
was
sammy
jay
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
sammy
jay
he
cried
at
the
sight
of
that
telltale
feather
all
the
birds
knew
that
weaver
was
right
and
led
by
scrapper
the
kingbird
they
began
a
noisy
search
of
the
old
orchard
for
the
sly
robber
but
sammy
was
to
be
found
and
they
soon
gave
up
the
search
none
daring
to
stay
longer
away
from
his
own
home
lest
something
should
happen
there
welcome
and
robin
continued
to
cry
mournfully
but
little
and
chebec
bore
their
trouble
almost
silently
there
is
one
thing
about
it
said
chebec
to
his
sorrowful
little
wife
that
egg
of
sally
sly
went
with
the
rest
and
we
wo
have
to
raise
that
bothersome
that
true
said
she
there
is
no
use
crying
over
what
ca
be
helped
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
sit
around
crying
come
on
chebec
let
look
for
a
place
to
build
another
nest
next
time
i
wo
leave
the
eggs
unwatched
for
a
meanwhile
jenny
wren
tongue
was
fairly
flying
as
she
chattered
to
peter
rabbit
who
had
come
up
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
and
of
course
had
to
know
all
about
it
blacky
the
crow
has
a
heart
as
black
as
his
coat
and
his
cousin
sammy
jay
is
much
better
declared
jenny
they
belong
to
a
family
of
wait
a
minute
cried
peter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
blacky
the
crow
and
sammy
jay
are
cousins
for
goodness
sake
peter
exclaimed
jenny
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
know
that
of
course
they
cousins
they
do
look
much
alike
but
they
belong
to
the
same
family
i
would
expect
almost
anything
bad
of
any
one
as
black
as
blacky
the
crow
but
how
such
a
handsome
fellow
as
sammy
jay
can
do
such
dreadful
things
i
understand
he
is
as
bad
as
blacky
because
he
does
do
a
lot
of
good
he
destroys
a
lot
of
caterpillars
and
other
pests
there
are
no
sharper
eyes
anywhere
than
those
of
sammy
jay
and
have
to
say
this
for
him
that
whenever
he
discovers
any
danger
he
always
gives
us
warning
he
has
saved
the
lives
of
a
good
many
of
us
feathered
folks
in
this
way
if
it
was
for
this
habit
of
stealing
our
eggs
i
would
have
a
word
to
say
against
him
but
at
that
he
as
bad
as
blacky
the
crow
they
say
blacky
does
some
good
by
destroying
white
grubs
and
some
other
harmful
pests
but
he
a
regular
cannibal
for
he
is
just
as
fond
of
young
birds
as
he
is
of
eggs
and
the
harm
he
does
in
this
way
is
more
than
the
good
he
does
in
other
ways
he
bold
black
and
bad
if
you
ask
remembering
her
household
duties
jenny
wren
disappeared
inside
her
house
in
her
usual
abrupt
fashion
peter
hung
around
for
a
while
but
finding
no
one
who
would
take
the
time
to
talk
to
him
he
suddenly
decided
to
go
over
to
the
green
forest
to
look
for
some
of
his
friends
there
he
had
gone
but
a
little
way
in
the
green
forest
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
blue
form
stealing
away
through
the
trees
he
knew
it
in
an
instant
for
there
is
no
one
with
such
a
coat
but
sammy
jay
peter
glanced
up
in
the
tree
from
which
sammy
had
flown
and
there
he
saw
a
nest
in
a
crotch
halfway
up
i
wonder
thought
peter
if
sammy
was
stealing
eggs
there
or
if
that
is
his
own
then
he
started
after
sammy
as
fast
as
he
could
go
as
he
ran
he
happened
to
look
back
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
jay
slip
on
to
the
nest
then
peter
knew
that
he
had
discovered
sammy
home
he
chuckled
as
he
ran
i
found
out
your
secret
sammy
jay
cried
peter
when
at
last
he
caught
up
with
sammy
then
i
hope
you
be
gentleman
enough
to
keep
it
grumbled
sammy
looking
not
at
all
pleased
certainly
replied
peter
with
dignity
i
would
think
of
telling
any
one
my
what
a
handsome
fellow
you
are
sammy
looked
pleased
he
is
a
little
bit
vain
is
sammy
jay
there
is
no
denying
that
he
is
handsome
he
is
just
a
bit
bigger
than
welcome
robin
his
back
is
his
tail
is
a
bright
blue
crossed
with
little
black
bars
and
edged
with
white
his
wings
are
blue
with
white
and
black
bars
his
throat
and
breast
are
a
soft
and
he
wears
a
collar
of
black
on
his
head
he
wears
a
pointed
cap
a
very
convenient
cap
for
at
times
he
draws
it
down
so
that
it
is
not
pointed
at
all
why
did
you
steal
chebec
eggs
demanded
peter
abruptly
sammy
did
look
the
least
bit
put
out
because
i
like
eggs
he
replied
promptly
if
people
will
leave
their
eggs
unguarded
they
must
expect
to
lose
them
how
did
you
know
i
took
those
eggs
never
mind
sammy
never
mind
a
little
bird
told
me
retorted
peter
mischievously
sammy
opened
his
mouth
for
a
sharp
reply
but
instead
he
uttered
a
cry
of
warning
run
peter
run
here
comes
reddy
fox
he
cried
peter
dived
headlong
under
a
great
pile
of
brush
there
he
was
quite
safe
while
he
waited
for
reddy
fox
to
go
away
he
thought
about
sammy
jay
it
funny
he
mused
how
so
much
good
and
so
much
bad
can
be
mixed
together
sammy
jay
stole
chebec
eggs
and
then
he
saved
my
life
i
just
know
he
would
have
done
as
much
for
and
chebec
or
for
any
other
feathered
neighbor
he
can
only
steal
eggs
for
a
little
while
in
the
spring
i
guess
on
the
whole
he
does
more
good
than
harm
i
going
to
think
so
peter
was
quite
right
sammy
jay
does
do
more
good
than
harm
chapter
xviii
some
homes
in
the
green
forest
reddy
fox
wasted
very
little
time
waiting
for
peter
rabbit
to
come
out
from
under
that
pile
of
brush
where
he
had
hidden
at
sammy
warning
after
making
some
terrible
threats
just
to
try
to
frighten
peter
he
trotted
away
to
look
for
some
mice
peter
did
mind
those
threats
at
all
he
was
used
to
them
he
knew
that
he
was
safe
where
he
was
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
stay
there
until
reddy
should
be
so
far
away
that
it
would
be
safe
to
come
out
just
to
pass
away
the
time
peter
took
a
little
nap
when
he
awoke
he
sat
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
next
from
over
in
the
direction
of
the
old
pasture
the
voice
of
blacky
the
crow
reached
him
peter
pricked
up
his
ears
then
chuckled
reddy
fox
has
gone
back
to
the
old
pasture
and
blacky
has
discovered
him
there
he
thought
happily
you
see
he
understood
what
blacky
was
saying
to
you
or
me
blacky
would
have
been
saying
simply
caw
caw
but
to
all
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
green
meadows
within
hearing
he
was
shouting
fox
fox
i
wonder
thought
peter
where
blacky
is
nesting
this
year
last
year
his
nest
was
in
a
tall
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
i
believe
i
run
over
there
and
see
if
he
has
a
new
nest
near
the
old
so
peter
scampered
over
to
the
tall
pine
in
which
was
blacky
old
nest
as
he
sat
with
his
head
tipped
back
staring
up
at
it
it
struck
him
that
that
nest
did
look
so
old
after
all
in
fact
it
looked
as
if
it
had
recently
been
fixed
up
quite
like
new
he
was
wondering
about
this
and
trying
to
guess
what
it
meant
when
blacky
himself
alighted
close
to
the
edge
of
it
there
was
something
in
his
bill
though
what
it
was
peter
could
see
almost
at
once
a
black
head
appeared
above
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
a
black
bill
seized
the
thing
which
blacky
had
brought
then
the
head
disappeared
and
blacky
silently
flew
away
as
sure
as
i
live
thought
peter
that
was
blacky
and
blacky
brought
her
some
food
so
that
she
would
not
have
to
leave
those
eggs
she
must
have
up
there
he
may
be
the
robber
every
one
says
he
is
but
he
certainly
is
a
good
husband
he
a
better
husband
than
some
others
i
know
of
whom
nothing
but
good
is
said
it
just
goes
to
show
that
there
is
some
good
in
the
very
worst
folks
blacky
is
a
sly
old
rascal
usually
he
is
as
noisy
as
any
one
i
know
but
he
came
and
went
without
making
a
sound
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
once
heard
his
voice
near
here
this
spring
i
guess
if
farmer
brown
boy
could
find
this
nest
he
would
get
even
with
blacky
for
pulling
up
his
corn
i
know
a
lot
of
clever
people
but
no
one
quite
so
clever
as
blacky
the
crow
with
all
his
badness
i
ca
help
liking
twice
while
peter
watched
blacky
returned
with
food
for
blacky
then
tired
of
keeping
still
so
long
peter
decided
to
run
over
to
a
certain
place
farther
in
the
green
forest
which
was
seldom
visited
by
any
one
it
was
a
place
peter
usually
kept
away
from
it
was
pure
curiosity
which
led
him
to
go
there
now
the
discovery
that
blacky
the
crow
was
using
his
old
nest
had
reminded
peter
that
redtail
the
hawk
uses
his
old
nest
year
after
year
and
he
wanted
to
find
out
if
redtail
had
come
back
to
it
this
year
halfway
over
to
that
lonesome
place
in
the
green
forest
a
trim
little
bird
flew
up
from
the
ground
hopped
from
branch
to
branch
of
a
tree
walked
along
a
limb
then
from
pure
happiness
threw
back
his
head
and
cried
teacher
teacher
teacher
teacher
teacher
each
time
a
little
louder
than
before
it
was
teacher
the
oven
bird
in
his
delight
at
seeing
this
old
friend
peter
quite
forgot
redtail
the
hawk
oh
teacher
cried
peter
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
teacher
stopped
singing
and
looked
down
at
peter
if
you
are
so
glad
why
have
you
been
over
to
see
me
before
he
demanded
i
been
here
for
some
peter
looked
a
little
foolish
the
truth
is
teacher
said
he
very
humbly
i
have
been
visiting
the
old
orchard
so
much
and
learning
so
many
things
that
this
is
the
first
chance
i
have
had
to
come
over
here
in
the
green
forest
you
see
i
have
been
learning
a
lot
of
things
about
you
feathered
folks
things
i
had
even
guessed
there
is
something
i
wish
you
tell
me
teacher
will
you
that
depends
on
what
it
is
replied
teacher
eyeing
peter
a
little
suspiciously
it
is
why
you
are
called
oven
bird
said
peter
is
that
all
asked
teacher
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
added
it
is
because
of
the
way
mrs
teacher
and
i
build
our
nest
some
people
think
it
is
like
an
oven
and
so
they
call
us
oven
birds
i
think
that
is
a
silly
name
myself
quite
as
silly
as
golden
crowned
thrush
which
is
what
some
people
call
me
i
not
a
thrush
i
not
even
related
to
the
thrush
family
i
a
warbler
a
wood
i
suppose
said
peter
looking
at
teacher
thoughtfully
they
given
you
that
name
because
you
are
dressed
something
like
the
thrushes
that
coat
and
white
waistcoat
all
streaked
and
spotted
with
black
certainly
does
remind
me
of
the
thrush
family
if
you
were
not
so
much
smaller
than
any
of
the
thrushes
i
should
almost
think
you
were
one
myself
why
you
are
not
very
much
bigger
than
chippy
the
chipping
sparrow
only
you
got
longer
legs
i
suppose
that
because
you
spend
so
much
time
on
the
ground
i
think
that
just
teacher
is
the
best
name
for
you
no
one
who
has
once
heard
you
could
ever
mistake
you
for
any
one
else
by
the
way
teacher
where
did
you
say
your
nest
is
i
did
say
retorted
teacher
what
more
i
not
going
to
wo
you
at
least
tell
me
if
it
is
in
a
tree
begged
peter
teacher
eyes
twinkled
i
guess
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
tell
you
that
much
said
he
no
it
is
in
a
tree
it
is
on
the
ground
and
if
i
do
say
it
it
is
as
well
hidden
a
nest
as
anybody
can
build
oh
peter
watch
your
step
watch
your
step
teacher
fairly
shrieked
this
warning
peter
who
had
just
started
to
hop
off
to
his
right
stopped
short
in
sheer
astonishment
just
in
front
of
him
was
a
tiny
mound
of
dead
leaves
and
a
few
feet
beyond
mrs
teacher
was
fluttering
about
on
the
ground
as
if
badly
hurt
peter
simply
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
once
more
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
hop
teacher
flew
right
down
in
front
of
him
you
step
on
my
nest
he
cried
peter
stared
for
he
did
see
any
nest
he
said
as
much
it
under
that
little
mound
of
leaves
right
in
front
of
your
feet
cried
teacher
i
was
going
to
tell
you
but
i
just
had
to
or
you
certainly
would
have
stepped
on
very
carefully
peter
walked
around
the
little
bunch
of
leaves
and
peered
under
them
from
the
other
side
there
sure
enough
was
a
nest
beneath
them
and
in
it
four
speckled
eggs
i
wo
tell
a
soul
teacher
i
promise
you
i
wo
tell
a
soul
declared
peter
very
earnestly
i
understand
now
why
you
are
called
oven
bird
but
i
still
like
the
name
teacher
feeling
that
and
mrs
teacher
would
feel
easier
in
their
minds
if
he
left
them
peter
said
and
started
on
for
the
lonesome
place
in
the
green
forest
where
he
knew
the
old
nest
of
redtail
the
hawk
had
been
as
he
drew
near
the
place
he
kept
sharp
watch
through
the
treetops
for
a
glimpse
of
redtail
presently
he
saw
him
high
in
the
blue
sky
sailing
lazily
in
big
circles
then
peter
became
very
very
cautious
he
tiptoed
forward
keeping
under
cover
as
much
as
possible
at
last
peeping
out
from
beneath
a
little
he
could
see
old
nest
he
saw
right
away
that
it
was
bigger
than
it
had
been
when
he
saw
it
last
suddenly
there
was
a
chorus
of
hungry
cries
and
peter
saw
redtail
approaching
with
a
mouse
in
her
claws
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
four
funny
heads
stretched
above
the
edge
of
the
nest
redtail
is
using
his
old
nest
again
and
has
got
a
family
already
exclaimed
peter
i
guess
this
is
no
place
for
me
the
sooner
i
get
away
from
here
the
just
then
redtail
himself
dropped
down
out
of
the
blue
blue
sky
and
alighted
on
a
tree
close
at
hand
peter
decided
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
sit
perfectly
still
where
he
was
he
had
a
splendid
view
of
redtail
and
he
could
help
but
admire
this
big
member
of
the
hawk
family
the
upper
parts
of
his
coat
were
a
dark
mixed
with
touches
of
chestnut
color
the
upper
part
of
his
breast
was
streaked
with
and
buff
the
lower
part
having
but
few
streaks
below
this
were
black
spots
and
bars
ending
in
white
but
it
was
the
tail
which
peter
noticed
most
of
all
it
was
a
rich
with
a
narrow
black
band
near
its
end
and
a
white
tip
peter
understood
at
once
why
this
big
hawk
is
called
redtail
it
was
not
until
and
redtail
had
gone
in
quest
of
more
food
for
their
hungry
youngsters
that
peter
dared
steal
away
as
soon
as
he
felt
it
safe
to
do
so
he
headed
for
home
as
fast
as
he
could
go
he
knew
that
he
would
feel
safe
until
that
lonesome
place
in
the
green
forest
was
far
behind
yet
if
the
truth
be
known
peter
had
less
cause
to
worry
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
it
been
some
other
member
of
the
hawk
family
instead
of
redtail
and
while
redtail
and
his
wife
do
sometimes
catch
some
of
their
feathered
and
furred
neighbors
and
once
in
a
while
a
chicken
they
do
vastly
more
good
than
harm
chapter
xix
a
maker
of
thunder
and
a
friend
in
black
peter
rabbit
intentions
were
of
the
best
once
safely
away
from
that
lonesome
part
of
the
green
forest
where
was
the
home
of
redtail
the
hawk
he
intended
to
go
straight
back
to
the
dear
old
but
he
was
not
halfway
there
when
from
another
direction
in
the
green
forest
there
came
a
sound
that
caused
him
to
stop
short
and
quite
forget
all
about
home
it
was
a
sound
very
like
distant
thunder
it
began
slowly
at
first
and
then
went
faster
and
faster
boom
boom
boom
it
was
like
the
long
roll
on
a
bass
drum
peter
laughed
right
out
that
strutter
the
stuffed
grouse
he
cried
joyously
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
i
certainly
must
go
over
and
pay
him
a
call
and
find
out
where
grouse
is
my
how
strutter
can
drum
peter
promptly
headed
towards
that
distant
thunder
as
he
drew
nearer
to
it
it
sounded
louder
and
louder
presently
peter
stopped
to
try
to
locate
exactly
the
place
where
that
sound
which
now
was
more
than
ever
like
thunder
was
coming
from
suddenly
peter
remembered
something
i
know
just
where
he
is
said
he
to
himself
there
a
big
mossy
hollow
log
over
yonder
and
i
remember
that
grouse
once
told
me
that
that
is
strutter
thunder
very
very
carefully
peter
stole
forward
making
no
sound
at
all
at
last
he
reached
a
place
where
he
could
peep
out
and
see
that
big
mossy
hollow
log
sure
enough
there
was
strutter
the
ruffed
grouse
when
peter
first
saw
him
he
was
crouched
on
one
end
of
the
log
a
fluffy
ball
of
black
and
gray
feathers
he
was
resting
suddenly
he
straightened
up
to
his
full
height
raised
his
tail
and
spread
it
until
it
was
like
an
open
fan
above
his
back
the
outer
edge
was
gray
then
came
a
broad
band
of
black
followed
by
bands
of
gray
brown
and
black
around
his
neck
was
a
wonderful
ruff
of
black
his
wings
were
dropped
until
the
tips
nearly
touched
the
log
his
full
breast
rounded
out
and
was
buff
color
with
black
markings
he
was
of
about
the
size
of
the
little
bantam
hens
peter
had
seen
in
farmer
brown
henyard
in
the
most
stately
way
you
can
imagine
strutter
walked
the
length
of
that
mossy
log
he
was
a
perfect
picture
of
pride
as
he
strutted
very
much
like
tom
gobbler
the
big
turkey
cock
when
he
reached
the
end
of
the
log
he
suddenly
dropped
his
tail
stretched
himself
to
his
full
height
and
his
wings
began
to
beat
first
slowly
then
faster
and
faster
until
they
were
just
a
blur
they
seemed
to
touch
above
his
back
but
when
they
came
down
they
did
quite
strike
his
sides
it
was
those
fast
moving
wings
that
made
the
thunder
it
was
so
loud
that
peter
almost
wanted
to
stop
his
ears
when
it
ended
strutter
settled
down
to
rest
and
once
more
appeared
like
a
ball
of
fluffy
feathers
his
ruff
was
laid
flat
peter
watched
him
thunder
several
times
and
then
ventured
to
show
himself
strutter
you
are
wonderful
simply
wonderful
cried
peter
and
he
meant
just
what
he
said
strutter
threw
out
his
chest
proudly
that
is
just
what
grouse
says
he
replied
i
do
know
of
any
better
thunderer
if
i
do
say
it
speaking
of
grouse
where
is
she
asked
peter
eagerly
attending
to
her
household
affairs
as
a
good
housewife
should
retorted
strutter
promptly
do
you
mean
she
has
a
nest
and
eggs
asked
peter
strutter
nodded
she
has
twelve
eggs
he
added
proudly
i
suppose
said
peter
artfully
her
nest
is
somewhere
near
here
on
the
it
on
the
ground
peter
but
as
to
where
it
is
i
am
not
saying
a
word
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
near
here
do
you
want
to
hear
me
thunder
again
of
course
peter
said
he
did
and
that
was
sufficient
excuse
for
strutter
to
show
off
peter
stayed
a
while
longer
to
gossip
but
finding
strutter
more
interested
in
thundering
than
in
talking
he
once
more
started
for
home
i
really
would
like
to
know
where
that
nest
is
said
he
to
himself
as
he
scampered
along
i
suppose
grouse
has
hidden
it
so
cleverly
that
it
is
quite
useless
to
look
for
on
his
way
he
passed
a
certain
big
tree
all
around
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
brown
dead
leaves
there
were
no
bushes
or
young
trees
there
peter
never
once
thought
of
looking
for
a
nest
it
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
he
would
expect
to
find
one
when
he
was
well
past
the
big
tree
there
was
a
soft
chuckle
and
from
among
the
brown
leaves
right
at
the
foot
of
that
big
tree
a
head
with
a
pair
of
the
brightest
eyes
was
raised
a
little
those
eyes
twinkled
as
they
watched
peter
out
of
sight
he
did
see
me
at
all
chuckled
grouse
as
she
settled
down
once
more
that
is
what
comes
of
having
a
cloak
so
like
the
color
of
these
nice
brown
leaves
he
is
the
first
one
who
has
passed
me
without
seeing
me
at
all
it
is
better
than
trying
to
hide
a
nest
and
i
certainly
am
thankful
to
old
mother
nature
for
the
cloak
she
gave
me
i
wonder
if
every
one
of
these
twelve
eggs
will
hatch
if
they
do
i
certainly
will
have
a
family
to
be
proud
meanwhile
peter
hurried
on
in
his
usual
fashion
until
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
out
on
the
green
meadows
just
beyond
he
caught
sight
of
a
black
form
walking
about
in
a
stately
way
and
now
and
then
picking
up
something
it
reminded
him
of
blacky
the
crow
but
he
knew
right
away
that
it
was
blacky
because
it
was
so
much
smaller
being
not
more
than
half
as
big
it
creaker
the
grackle
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
this
spring
and
i
ashamed
of
myself
for
not
having
called
on
him
thought
peter
as
he
hopped
out
and
started
across
the
green
meadows
towards
creaker
what
a
splendid
long
tail
he
has
i
believe
jenny
wren
told
me
that
he
belongs
to
the
blackbird
family
he
looks
so
much
like
blacky
the
crow
that
i
suppose
this
is
why
they
call
him
crow
just
then
creaker
turned
in
such
a
way
that
the
sun
fell
full
on
his
head
and
back
why
exclaimed
peter
rubbing
his
eyes
with
astonishment
he
is
just
black
he
beautiful
simply
beautiful
and
i
always
supposed
he
was
just
plain
homely
it
was
true
creaker
the
grackle
with
the
sun
shining
on
him
was
truly
beautiful
his
head
and
neck
his
throat
and
upper
breast
were
a
shining
while
his
back
was
a
rich
shining
his
wings
and
tail
were
much
like
his
head
and
neck
as
peter
watched
it
seemed
as
if
the
colors
were
constantly
changing
this
changing
of
colors
is
called
iridescence
one
other
thing
peter
noticed
and
this
was
that
creaker
eyes
were
yellow
just
at
the
moment
peter
remember
any
other
bird
with
yellow
eyes
creaker
cried
peter
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
handsome
you
are
i
glad
you
think
so
replied
creaker
i
not
at
all
vain
but
there
are
mighty
few
birds
i
would
change
coats
is
is
creaker
dressed
as
handsomely
as
you
are
asked
peter
rather
timidly
creaker
shook
his
head
not
quite
said
he
she
likes
plain
black
better
some
of
the
feathers
on
her
back
shine
like
mine
but
she
says
that
she
has
no
time
to
show
off
in
the
sun
and
to
take
care
of
fine
where
is
she
now
asked
peter
over
home
replied
creaker
pulling
a
white
grub
out
of
the
roots
of
the
grass
we
got
a
nest
over
there
in
one
of
those
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
and
i
expect
any
day
now
we
will
have
four
hungry
babies
to
feed
i
shall
have
to
get
busy
then
you
know
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
every
father
should
do
his
full
share
in
taking
care
of
his
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
it
declared
peter
nodding
his
head
with
approval
quite
as
if
he
was
himself
the
best
of
fathers
which
he
at
all
may
i
ask
you
a
very
personal
question
creaker
ask
as
many
questions
as
you
like
i
do
have
to
answer
them
unless
i
want
to
retorted
creaker
is
it
true
that
you
steal
the
eggs
of
other
birds
peter
blurted
the
question
out
rather
hurriedly
creaker
yellow
eyes
began
to
twinkle
that
is
a
very
personal
question
said
he
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
steal
eggs
but
found
that
eggs
are
very
good
for
my
constitution
and
if
i
find
a
nest
with
nobody
around
i
sometimes
help
myself
to
the
eggs
you
see
the
owner
might
not
come
back
and
then
those
eggs
would
spoil
and
that
would
be
a
that
no
excuse
at
all
declared
peter
i
believe
you
no
better
than
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
creaker
chuckled
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
offended
just
then
he
heard
creaker
calling
him
and
with
a
hasty
farewell
he
spread
his
wings
and
headed
for
the
green
forest
once
in
the
air
he
seemed
just
plain
black
peter
watched
him
out
of
sight
and
then
once
more
headed
for
the
dear
old
chapter
xx
a
fisherman
robbed
just
out
of
curiosity
and
because
he
possesses
what
is
called
the
wandering
foot
which
means
that
he
delights
to
roam
about
peter
rabbit
had
run
over
to
the
bank
of
the
big
river
there
were
plenty
of
bushes
clumps
of
tall
grass
weeds
and
tangles
of
vines
along
the
bank
of
the
big
river
so
that
peter
felt
quite
safe
there
he
liked
to
sit
gazing
out
over
the
water
and
wonder
where
it
all
came
from
and
where
it
was
going
and
what
kept
it
moving
he
was
doing
this
very
thing
on
this
particular
morning
when
he
happened
to
glance
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
there
he
saw
a
bird
sailing
in
wide
graceful
circles
instantly
peter
crouched
a
little
lower
in
his
for
he
knew
this
for
a
member
of
the
hawk
family
and
peter
has
learned
by
experience
that
the
only
way
to
keep
perfectly
safe
when
one
of
these
birds
is
about
is
to
keep
out
of
sight
so
now
he
crouched
very
close
to
the
ground
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
big
bird
sailing
so
gracefully
high
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
over
the
big
river
suddenly
the
stranger
paused
in
his
flight
and
for
a
moment
appeared
to
remain
in
one
place
his
great
wings
heating
rapidly
to
hold
him
there
then
those
wings
were
closed
and
with
a
rush
he
shot
down
straight
for
the
water
disappearing
with
a
great
splash
instantly
peter
sat
up
to
his
full
height
that
he
might
see
better
it
plunger
the
osprey
fishing
and
i
nothing
to
fear
from
him
he
cried
happily
out
of
the
water
his
great
wings
flapping
rose
plunger
peter
looked
eagerly
to
see
if
he
had
caught
a
fish
but
there
was
nothing
in
plunger
great
curved
claws
either
that
fish
had
been
too
deep
or
had
seen
plunger
and
darted
away
just
in
the
nick
of
time
peter
had
a
splendid
view
of
plunger
he
was
just
a
little
bigger
than
redtail
the
hawk
above
he
was
dark
brown
his
head
and
neck
marked
with
white
his
tail
was
grayish
crossed
by
several
narrow
dark
bands
and
tipped
with
white
his
under
parts
were
white
with
some
light
brown
spots
on
his
breast
peter
could
see
clearly
the
great
curved
claws
which
are
plunger
fishhooks
up
up
up
he
rose
going
round
and
round
in
a
spiral
when
he
was
well
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
he
began
to
sail
again
in
wide
circles
as
when
peter
had
first
seen
him
it
was
long
before
he
again
paused
and
then
shot
down
towards
the
water
this
time
he
abruptly
spread
his
great
wings
just
before
reaching
the
water
so
that
he
no
more
than
wet
his
feet
once
more
a
fish
had
escaped
him
but
plunger
seemed
not
in
the
least
discouraged
he
is
a
true
fisherman
and
every
true
fisherman
possesses
patience
up
again
he
spiraled
until
he
was
so
high
that
peter
wondered
how
he
could
possibly
see
a
fish
so
far
below
you
see
peter
did
know
that
it
is
easier
to
see
down
into
the
water
from
high
above
it
than
from
close
to
it
then
too
there
are
no
more
wonderful
eyes
than
those
possessed
by
the
members
of
the
hawk
family
and
plunger
the
osprey
is
a
hawk
usually
called
fish
hawk
a
third
time
plunger
shot
down
and
this
time
as
in
his
first
attempt
he
struck
the
water
with
a
great
splash
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
he
reappeared
shaking
the
water
from
him
in
a
silver
spray
and
flapping
heavily
this
time
fetes
could
gee
a
great
shining
fish
in
his
claws
it
was
heavy
as
peter
could
tell
by
the
way
in
which
plunger
flew
he
headed
towards
a
tall
tree
on
the
other
bank
of
the
big
river
there
to
enjoy
his
breakfast
he
was
not
more
than
halfway
there
when
peter
was
startled
by
a
harsh
scream
he
looked
up
to
see
a
great
bird
with
wonderful
broad
wings
swinging
in
short
circles
about
plunger
his
body
and
wings
were
dark
brown
and
his
head
was
snowy
white
as
was
his
tail
his
great
hooked
beak
was
yellow
and
his
legs
were
yellow
peter
knew
in
an
instant
who
it
was
there
could
be
no
mistake
it
was
king
eagle
commonly
known
as
bald
head
though
his
head
is
bald
at
all
peter
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
for
it
was
quite
plain
to
him
that
king
eagle
was
after
plunger
and
peter
understand
this
at
all
you
see
he
did
understand
what
king
eagle
was
screaming
but
plunger
did
king
eagle
was
screaming
drop
that
fish
drop
that
fish
plunger
did
intend
to
drop
that
fish
if
he
could
help
himself
it
was
his
fish
had
he
caught
it
himself
he
did
intend
to
give
it
up
to
any
robber
of
the
air
even
though
that
robber
was
king
eagle
himself
unless
he
was
actually
forced
to
so
plunger
began
to
dodge
and
twist
and
turn
in
the
air
all
the
time
mounting
higher
and
higher
and
all
the
time
screaming
harshly
robber
thief
i
wo
drop
this
fish
mine
it
mine
now
the
fish
was
heavy
so
of
course
plunger
could
fly
as
easily
and
swiftly
as
if
he
were
carrying
nothing
up
up
he
went
but
all
the
time
king
eagle
went
up
with
him
circling
round
him
screaming
harshly
and
threatening
to
strike
him
with
those
great
cruel
curved
claws
peter
watched
them
so
excited
that
he
fairly
danced
o
i
do
hope
plunger
will
get
away
from
that
big
robber
cried
peter
he
may
be
king
of
the
air
but
he
is
a
robber
just
the
plunger
and
king
eagle
were
now
high
in
the
air
above
the
big
river
suddenly
king
eagle
swung
above
plunger
and
for
an
instant
seemed
to
hold
himself
still
there
just
as
plunger
had
done
before
he
had
shot
down
into
the
water
after
that
fish
there
was
a
still
harsher
note
in
king
eagle
scream
if
peter
had
been
near
enough
he
would
have
seen
a
look
of
anger
and
determination
in
king
eagle
fierce
yellow
eyes
plunger
saw
it
and
knew
what
it
meant
he
knew
that
king
eagle
would
stand
for
no
more
fooling
with
a
cry
of
bitter
disappointment
and
anger
he
let
go
of
the
big
fish
down
down
dropped
the
fish
shining
in
the
sun
like
a
bar
of
silver
king
eagle
wings
half
closed
and
he
shot
down
like
a
thunderbolt
just
before
the
fish
reached
the
water
king
eagle
struck
it
with
his
great
claws
checked
himself
by
spreading
his
broad
wings
and
tail
and
then
in
triumph
flew
over
to
the
very
tree
towards
which
plunger
had
started
when
he
had
caught
the
fish
there
he
leisurely
made
his
breakfast
apparently
enjoying
it
as
much
as
if
he
had
come
by
it
honestly
as
for
poor
plunger
he
shook
himself
screamed
angrily
once
or
twice
then
appeared
to
think
that
it
was
wisest
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
matter
and
that
there
were
more
fish
where
that
one
had
come
from
for
he
once
more
began
to
sail
in
circles
over
the
big
river
searching
for
a
fish
near
the
surface
peter
watched
him
until
he
saw
him
catch
another
fish
and
fly
away
with
it
in
triumph
king
eagle
watched
him
too
but
having
had
a
good
breakfast
he
was
quite
willing
to
let
plunger
enjoy
his
catch
in
peace
late
that
afternoon
peter
visited
the
old
orchard
for
he
just
had
to
tell
jenny
wren
all
about
what
he
had
seen
that
morning
king
eagle
is
king
simply
because
he
is
so
big
and
fierce
and
strong
sputtered
jenny
he
is
kingly
in
his
habits
not
the
least
bit
he
never
hesitates
to
rob
those
smaller
than
himself
just
as
you
saw
him
rob
plunger
he
is
very
fond
of
fish
and
once
in
a
while
he
catches
one
for
himself
when
plunger
is
around
to
be
robbed
but
he
is
a
very
good
fisherman
and
he
is
the
least
bit
fussy
about
his
fish
plunger
eats
only
fresh
fish
which
he
catches
himself
but
king
eagle
will
eat
dead
fish
which
he
finds
on
the
shore
he
does
seem
to
care
how
long
they
have
been
dead
does
he
eat
anything
but
fish
asked
peter
innocently
well
retorted
jenny
wren
her
eyes
twinkling
i
would
advise
you
to
run
across
the
green
meadows
in
sight
of
king
eagle
i
am
told
he
is
very
fond
of
rabbit
in
fact
he
is
very
fond
of
fresh
meat
of
any
kind
he
even
catches
the
babies
of
lightfoot
the
deer
when
he
gets
a
chance
he
is
so
swift
of
wing
that
even
the
members
of
the
duck
family
fear
him
for
he
is
especially
fond
of
fat
duck
even
honker
the
goose
is
not
safe
from
him
king
he
may
he
but
he
rules
only
through
fear
he
is
a
old
robber
the
best
thing
i
can
say
of
him
is
that
he
takes
a
mate
for
life
and
is
loyal
and
true
to
her
as
long
as
she
lives
and
that
is
a
great
many
years
by
the
way
peter
did
you
know
that
she
is
bigger
than
he
is
and
that
the
young
during
the
first
year
after
leaving
their
nest
are
bigger
than
their
parents
and
do
not
have
white
heads
by
the
time
they
get
white
heads
they
are
the
same
size
as
their
that
queer
and
its
hard
to
believe
said
peter
it
is
queer
but
it
is
true
just
the
same
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
retorted
jenny
wren
and
whisked
out
of
sight
into
her
home
chapter
xxi
a
fishing
party
peter
rabbit
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
old
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
stay
at
home
which
was
the
wise
and
proper
thing
to
do
or
to
go
call
on
some
of
the
friends
he
had
not
yet
visited
a
sharp
harsh
rattle
caused
him
to
look
up
to
see
a
bird
about
a
third
larger
than
welcome
robin
and
with
a
head
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
size
of
his
body
he
was
flying
straight
towards
the
smiling
pool
rattling
harshly
as
he
flew
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
settled
the
matter
for
peter
it
rattles
the
kingfisher
he
cried
i
think
run
over
to
the
smiling
pool
and
pay
him
my
so
peter
started
for
the
smiling
pool
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
he
had
lost
sight
of
rattles
the
kingfisher
and
when
he
reached
the
back
of
the
smiling
pool
he
was
in
doubt
which
way
to
turn
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
ripple
on
the
surface
of
the
smiling
pool
as
peter
sat
there
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
which
way
to
go
he
saw
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
big
river
a
great
bird
flying
slowly
he
seemed
to
have
no
neck
at
all
but
carried
straight
out
behind
him
were
two
long
legs
longlegs
the
great
blue
heron
i
wonder
if
he
is
coming
here
exclaimed
peter
i
do
hope
peter
stayed
right
where
he
was
and
waited
nearer
and
nearer
came
longlegs
when
he
was
right
opposite
peter
he
suddenly
dropped
his
long
legs
folded
his
great
wings
and
alighted
right
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
across
from
where
peter
was
sitting
if
he
seemed
to
have
no
neck
at
all
when
he
was
flying
now
he
seemed
to
be
all
neck
as
he
stretched
it
to
its
full
length
the
fact
is
his
neck
was
so
long
that
when
he
was
flying
he
carried
it
folded
back
on
his
shoulders
never
before
had
peter
had
such
an
opportunity
to
see
longlegs
he
stood
quite
four
feet
high
the
top
of
his
head
and
throat
were
white
from
the
base
of
his
great
bill
and
over
his
eye
was
a
black
stripe
which
ended
in
two
long
slender
black
feathers
hanging
from
the
back
of
his
head
his
bill
was
longer
than
his
head
stout
and
sharp
like
a
spear
and
yellow
in
color
his
long
neck
was
a
light
his
back
and
wings
were
of
a
bluish
color
the
bend
of
each
wing
and
the
feathered
parts
of
his
legs
were
a
the
remainder
of
his
legs
and
his
feet
were
black
hanging
down
over
his
breast
were
beautiful
long
feathers
quite
unlike
any
peter
had
seen
on
any
of
his
other
feathered
friends
in
spite
of
the
length
of
his
legs
and
the
length
of
his
neck
he
was
both
graceful
and
handsome
i
wonder
what
has
brought
him
over
to
the
smiling
pool
thought
peter
he
did
have
to
wait
long
to
find
out
after
standing
perfectly
still
with
his
neck
stretched
to
its
full
height
until
he
was
sure
that
no
danger
was
near
longlegs
waded
into
the
water
a
few
steps
folded
his
neck
back
on
his
shoulders
until
his
long
bill
seemed
to
rest
on
his
breast
and
then
remained
as
motionless
as
if
there
were
no
life
in
him
peter
also
sat
perfectly
still
by
and
by
he
began
to
wonder
if
longlegs
had
gone
to
sleep
his
own
patience
was
reaching
an
end
and
he
was
just
about
to
go
on
in
search
of
rattles
the
kingfisher
when
like
a
flash
the
bill
of
longlegs
shot
out
and
down
into
the
water
when
he
withdrew
it
peter
saw
that
longlegs
had
caught
a
little
fish
which
he
at
once
proceeded
to
swallow
peter
almost
laughed
right
out
as
he
watched
the
funny
efforts
of
longlegs
to
gulp
that
fish
down
his
long
throat
then
longlegs
resumed
his
old
position
as
motionless
as
before
it
was
no
trouble
now
for
peter
to
sit
still
for
he
was
too
interested
in
watching
this
lone
fisherman
to
think
of
leaving
it
was
long
before
longlegs
made
another
catch
and
this
time
it
was
a
fat
pollywog
peter
thought
of
how
he
had
watched
plunger
the
osprey
fishing
in
the
big
river
and
the
difference
in
the
ways
of
the
two
fishermen
plunger
hunts
for
his
fish
while
longlegs
waits
for
his
fish
to
come
to
him
thought
peter
i
wonder
if
longlegs
never
goes
as
if
in
answer
to
peter
thought
longlegs
seemed
to
conclude
that
no
more
fish
were
coming
his
way
he
stretched
himself
up
to
his
full
height
looked
sharply
this
way
and
that
way
to
make
sure
that
all
was
safe
then
began
to
walk
along
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
he
put
each
foot
down
slowly
and
carefully
so
as
to
make
no
noise
he
had
gone
but
a
few
steps
when
that
great
bill
darted
down
like
a
flash
and
peter
saw
that
he
had
caught
a
careless
young
frog
a
few
steps
farther
on
he
caught
another
pollywog
then
coming
to
a
spot
that
suited
him
he
once
more
waded
in
and
began
to
watch
for
fish
peter
was
suddenly
reminded
of
rattles
the
kingfisher
whom
he
had
quite
forgotten
from
the
big
on
the
bank
rattles
flew
out
over
the
smiling
pool
hovered
for
an
instant
then
plunged
down
there
was
a
splash
and
a
second
later
rattles
was
in
the
air
again
shaking
the
water
from
him
in
a
silver
spray
in
his
long
stout
black
bill
was
a
little
fish
he
flew
back
to
a
branch
of
the
big
that
hung
out
over
the
water
and
thumped
the
fish
against
the
branch
until
it
was
dead
then
he
turned
it
about
so
he
could
swallow
it
it
was
a
big
fish
for
the
size
of
the
fisherman
and
he
had
a
dreadful
time
getting
it
down
but
at
last
it
was
down
and
rattles
set
himself
to
watch
for
another
the
sun
shone
full
on
him
and
peter
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
i
never
knew
before
how
handsome
rattles
is
thought
peter
he
was
about
the
size
of
yellow
wing
the
flicker
but
his
head
made
him
look
bigger
than
he
really
was
you
see
the
feathers
on
top
of
his
head
stood
up
in
a
crest
as
if
they
had
been
brushed
the
wrong
way
his
head
back
wings
and
tail
were
a
his
throat
was
white
and
he
wore
a
white
collar
in
front
of
each
eye
was
a
little
white
spot
across
his
breast
was
a
belt
of
and
underneath
he
was
white
there
were
tiny
spots
of
white
on
his
wings
and
his
tail
was
spotted
with
white
his
bill
was
black
and
like
that
of
longlegs
was
long
and
stout
and
sharp
it
looked
almost
too
big
for
his
size
presently
rattles
flew
out
and
plunged
into
the
smiling
pool
again
this
time
very
near
to
where
longlegs
was
patiently
waiting
he
caught
a
fish
for
it
is
not
often
that
rattles
misses
it
was
smaller
than
the
first
one
peter
had
seen
him
catch
and
this
time
as
soon
as
he
got
back
to
the
big
he
swallowed
it
without
thumping
it
against
the
branch
as
for
longlegs
he
looked
thoroughly
put
out
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stood
glaring
angrily
up
at
rattles
you
see
when
rattles
had
plunged
so
close
to
longlegs
he
had
frightened
all
the
fish
finally
longlegs
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
that
there
was
room
for
but
one
fisherman
at
a
time
at
the
smiling
pool
spreading
his
great
wings
folding
his
long
neck
back
on
his
shoulders
and
dragging
his
long
legs
out
behind
him
he
flew
heavily
away
in
the
direction
of
the
big
river
rattles
remained
long
enough
to
catch
another
little
fish
and
then
with
a
harsh
rattle
flew
off
down
the
laughing
brook
i
would
know
him
anywhere
by
that
rattle
thought
peter
there
is
any
one
who
can
make
a
noise
anything
like
it
i
wonder
where
he
has
gone
to
now
he
must
have
a
nest
but
i
have
the
least
idea
what
kind
of
a
nest
he
builds
hello
there
grandfather
frog
over
on
his
green
lily
pad
perhaps
he
can
tell
so
peter
hopped
along
until
he
was
near
enough
to
talk
to
grandfather
frog
what
kind
of
a
nest
does
rattles
the
kingfisher
build
repeated
grandfather
frog
peter
rabbit
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
rattles
does
build
a
nest
at
least
i
would
call
it
a
nest
he
lives
in
a
hole
in
the
what
cried
peter
and
looked
as
if
he
could
believe
his
own
ears
grandfather
frog
grinned
and
his
goggly
eyes
twinkled
yes
said
he
rattles
lives
in
a
hole
in
the
but
but
but
what
kind
of
a
hole
stammered
peter
just
plain
hole
retorted
grandfather
frog
grinning
more
broadly
than
ever
then
seeing
how
perplexed
and
puzzled
peter
looked
he
went
on
to
explain
he
usually
picks
out
a
high
gravelly
bank
close
to
the
water
and
digs
a
hole
straight
in
just
a
little
way
from
the
top
he
makes
it
just
big
enough
for
himself
and
rattles
to
go
in
and
out
of
comfortably
and
he
digs
it
straight
in
for
several
feet
i
told
that
at
the
end
of
it
he
makes
a
sort
of
bedroom
because
he
usually
has
a
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
digs
it
himself
asked
peter
grandfather
frog
nodded
if
he
does
kingfisher
does
he
replied
those
big
bills
of
theirs
are
picks
as
well
as
fish
spears
they
loosen
the
sand
with
those
and
scoop
it
out
with
their
feet
never
seen
the
inside
of
their
home
myself
but
i
told
that
their
bedroom
is
lined
with
fish
bones
perhaps
you
may
call
that
a
nest
but
i
i
going
straight
down
the
laughing
brook
to
look
for
that
hole
declared
peter
and
left
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
forgot
to
be
polite
enough
to
say
thank
you
to
grandfather
frog
chapter
xxii
some
feathered
diggers
peter
rabbit
scampered
along
down
one
bank
of
the
laughing
brook
eagerly
watching
for
a
high
gravelly
bank
such
as
grandfather
frog
had
said
that
rattles
the
kingfisher
likes
to
make
his
home
in
if
peter
had
stopped
to
do
a
little
thinking
he
would
have
known
that
he
was
simply
wasting
time
you
see
the
laughing
brook
was
flowing
through
the
green
meadows
so
of
course
there
would
be
no
high
gravelly
bank
because
the
green
meadows
are
low
but
peter
rabbit
in
his
usual
heedless
way
did
no
thinking
he
had
seen
rattles
fly
down
the
laughing
brook
and
so
he
had
just
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
home
of
rattles
must
be
somewhere
down
there
at
last
peter
reached
the
place
where
the
laughing
brook
entered
the
big
river
of
course
he
had
found
the
home
of
rattles
but
now
he
did
find
something
that
for
the
time
being
made
him
quite
forget
rattles
and
his
home
just
before
it
reached
the
big
river
the
laughing
brook
wound
through
a
swamp
in
which
were
many
tall
trees
and
a
great
number
of
young
trees
a
great
many
big
ferns
grew
there
and
were
splendid
to
hide
under
peter
always
did
like
that
swamp
he
had
stopped
to
rest
in
a
clump
of
ferns
when
he
was
startled
by
seeing
a
great
bird
alight
in
a
tree
just
a
little
way
from
him
his
first
thought
was
that
it
was
a
hawk
so
you
can
imagine
how
surprised
and
pleased
he
was
to
discover
that
it
was
longlegs
somehow
peter
had
always
thought
of
longlegs
the
blue
heron
as
never
alighting
anywhere
except
on
the
ground
but
here
was
longlegs
in
a
tree
having
nothing
to
fear
peter
crept
out
from
his
hiding
place
that
he
might
see
better
in
the
tree
in
which
longlegs
was
perched
and
just
below
her
he
saw
a
little
platform
of
sticks
he
did
suspect
that
it
was
a
nest
because
it
looked
too
rough
and
loosely
put
together
to
be
a
nest
probably
he
would
have
thought
about
it
at
all
had
not
longlegs
settled
herself
on
it
right
while
peter
was
watching
it
did
seem
big
enough
or
strong
enough
to
hold
her
but
it
did
as
i
live
thought
peter
i
found
the
nest
of
longlegs
he
and
longlegs
may
be
good
fishermen
but
they
certainly
are
mighty
poor
i
do
see
how
under
the
sun
longlegs
ever
gets
on
and
off
that
nest
without
kicking
the
eggs
peter
sat
around
for
a
while
but
as
he
did
care
to
let
his
presence
be
known
and
as
there
was
no
one
to
talk
to
he
presently
made
up
his
mind
that
being
so
near
the
big
river
he
would
go
over
there
to
see
if
plunger
the
osprey
was
fishing
again
on
this
day
when
he
reached
the
big
river
plunger
was
not
in
sight
peter
was
disappointed
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
to
return
the
way
he
had
come
when
from
beyond
the
swamp
farther
up
the
big
river
he
heard
the
harsh
rattling
cry
of
rattles
the
kingfisher
it
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
come
for
and
he
at
once
began
to
hurry
in
that
direction
peter
came
out
of
the
swamp
on
a
little
sandy
beach
there
he
squatted
for
a
moment
blinking
his
eyes
for
out
there
the
sun
was
very
bright
then
a
little
way
beyond
him
he
discovered
something
that
in
his
eager
curiosity
made
him
quite
forget
that
he
was
out
in
the
open
where
it
was
anything
but
safe
for
a
rabbit
to
be
what
he
saw
was
a
high
sandy
bank
with
a
hasty
glance
this
way
and
that
way
to
make
sure
that
no
enemy
was
in
sight
peter
scampered
along
the
edge
of
the
water
till
he
was
right
at
the
foot
of
that
sandy
bank
then
he
squatted
down
and
looked
eagerly
for
a
hole
such
as
he
imagined
rattles
the
kingfisher
might
make
instead
of
one
hole
he
saw
a
lot
of
holes
but
they
were
very
small
holes
he
knew
right
away
that
rattles
could
possibly
get
in
or
out
of
a
single
one
of
those
holes
in
fact
those
holes
in
the
bank
were
no
bigger
than
the
holes
downy
the
woodpecker
makes
in
trees
peter
could
imagine
who
or
what
had
made
them
as
peter
sat
there
staring
and
wondering
a
trim
little
head
appeared
at
the
entrance
to
one
of
those
holes
it
was
a
trim
little
head
with
a
very
small
bill
and
a
snowy
white
throat
at
first
glance
peter
thought
it
was
his
old
friend
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
and
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
asking
what
under
the
sun
skimmer
was
doing
in
such
a
place
as
that
when
with
a
lively
twitter
of
greeting
the
owner
of
that
little
hole
in
the
bank
flew
out
and
circled
over
peter
head
it
skimmer
at
all
it
was
banker
the
bank
swallow
own
cousin
to
skimmer
the
tree
swallow
peter
recognized
him
the
instant
he
got
a
full
view
of
him
in
the
first
place
banker
was
a
little
smaller
than
skimmer
then
too
he
was
not
nearly
so
handsome
his
back
instead
of
being
that
beautiful
rich
which
makes
skimmer
so
handsome
was
a
sober
he
was
a
little
darker
on
his
wings
and
tail
his
breast
instead
of
being
all
snowy
white
was
crossed
with
a
brownish
band
his
tail
was
more
nearly
square
across
the
end
than
is
the
case
with
other
members
of
the
swallow
family
wha
wha
what
were
you
doing
there
stuttered
peter
his
eyes
popping
right
out
with
curiosity
and
excitement
why
that
my
home
twittered
banker
do
do
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
live
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
cried
peter
certainly
why
not
twittered
banker
as
he
snapped
up
a
fly
just
over
peter
head
i
do
know
any
reason
why
you
should
confessed
peter
but
somehow
it
is
hard
for
me
to
think
of
birds
as
living
in
holes
in
the
ground
i
only
just
found
out
that
rattles
the
kingfisher
does
but
i
did
suppose
there
were
any
others
did
you
make
that
hole
yourself
banker
of
course
replied
banker
that
is
i
helped
make
it
banker
did
her
share
in
at
the
end
of
it
we
got
the
nicest
little
nest
of
straw
and
feathers
what
is
more
we
got
four
white
eggs
in
there
and
banker
is
sitting
on
them
by
this
time
the
air
seemed
to
be
full
of
banker
friends
skimming
and
circling
this
way
and
that
and
going
in
and
out
of
the
little
holes
in
the
bank
i
am
like
my
big
cousin
twitter
the
purple
martin
fond
of
society
explained
banker
we
bank
swallows
like
our
homes
close
together
you
said
that
you
had
just
learned
that
rattles
the
kingfisher
has
his
home
in
a
bank
do
you
know
where
it
is
no
replied
peter
i
was
looking
for
it
when
i
discovered
your
home
can
you
tell
me
where
it
is
i
do
better
than
that
replied
banker
i
show
you
where
it
he
darted
some
distance
up
along
the
bank
and
hovered
for
an
instant
close
to
the
top
peter
scampered
over
there
and
looked
up
there
just
a
few
inches
below
the
top
was
another
hole
a
very
much
larger
hole
than
those
he
had
just
left
as
he
was
staring
up
at
it
a
head
with
a
long
sharp
bill
and
a
crest
which
looked
as
if
all
the
feathers
on
the
top
of
his
head
had
been
brushed
the
wrong
way
was
thrust
out
it
was
rattles
himself
he
did
seem
at
all
glad
to
see
peter
in
fact
he
came
out
and
darted
at
peter
angrily
peter
did
wait
to
feel
that
sharp
bill
he
took
to
his
heels
he
had
seen
what
he
started
out
to
find
and
he
was
quite
content
to
go
home
peter
took
a
short
cut
across
the
green
meadows
it
took
him
past
a
certain
tall
dead
tree
a
sharp
cry
of
caused
peter
to
look
up
just
in
time
to
see
a
trim
handsome
bird
whose
body
was
about
the
size
of
sammy
jay
but
whose
longer
wings
and
longer
tail
made
him
look
bigger
one
glance
was
enough
to
tell
peter
that
this
was
a
member
of
the
hawk
family
the
smallest
of
the
family
it
was
killy
the
sparrow
hawk
he
is
too
small
for
peter
to
fear
him
so
now
peter
was
possessed
of
nothing
more
than
a
very
lively
curiosity
and
sat
up
to
watch
out
over
the
meadow
grass
killy
sailed
suddenly
with
beating
wings
he
kept
himself
in
one
place
in
the
air
and
then
dropped
down
into
the
grass
he
was
up
again
in
an
instant
and
peter
could
see
that
he
had
a
fat
grasshopper
in
his
claws
back
to
the
top
of
the
tall
dead
tree
he
flew
and
there
ate
the
grasshopper
when
it
was
finished
he
sat
up
straight
and
still
so
still
that
he
seemed
a
part
of
the
tree
itself
with
those
wonderful
eyes
of
his
he
was
watching
for
another
grasshopper
or
for
a
careless
meadow
mouse
very
trim
and
handsome
was
killy
his
back
was
crossed
by
bars
of
black
his
tail
was
with
a
band
of
black
near
its
end
and
a
white
tip
his
wings
were
with
little
bars
of
black
the
longest
feathers
leaving
white
bars
underneath
he
was
a
beautiful
buff
spotted
with
black
his
head
was
bluish
with
a
reddish
patch
right
on
top
before
and
behind
each
ear
was
a
black
mark
his
rather
short
bill
like
the
bills
of
all
the
rest
of
his
family
was
hooked
as
peter
sat
there
admiring
killy
for
he
was
handsome
enough
for
any
one
to
admire
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
hole
high
up
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
such
a
hole
as
yellow
wing
the
flicker
might
have
made
and
probably
did
make
right
away
peter
remembered
what
jenny
wren
had
told
him
about
killy
making
his
nest
in
just
such
a
hole
i
wonder
thought
peter
if
that
is
killy
just
then
killy
flew
over
and
dropped
in
the
grass
just
in
front
of
peter
where
he
caught
another
fat
grasshopper
is
that
your
home
up
there
asked
peter
hastily
it
certainly
is
peter
replied
killy
this
is
the
third
summer
killy
and
i
have
had
our
home
you
seem
to
be
very
fond
of
grasshoppers
peter
ventured
i
am
replied
killy
they
are
very
fine
eating
when
one
can
get
enough
of
are
they
the
only
kind
of
food
you
eat
ventured
peter
killy
laughed
it
was
a
shrill
laugh
i
should
say
not
said
he
i
eat
spiders
and
worms
and
all
sorts
of
insects
big
enough
to
give
a
fellow
a
decent
bite
but
for
real
good
eating
give
me
a
fat
meadow
mouse
i
do
object
to
a
sparrow
or
some
other
small
bird
now
and
then
especially
when
i
have
a
family
of
hungry
youngsters
to
feed
but
take
it
the
season
through
i
live
mostly
on
grasshoppers
and
insects
and
meadow
mice
i
do
a
lot
of
good
in
this
world
i
have
you
peter
said
that
he
supposed
that
this
was
so
but
all
the
time
he
kept
thinking
what
a
pity
it
was
that
killy
ever
killed
his
feathered
neighbors
as
soon
as
he
conveniently
could
he
politely
bade
killy
and
hurried
home
to
the
dear
old
there
to
think
over
how
queer
it
seemed
that
a
member
of
the
hawk
family
should
nest
in
a
hollow
tree
and
a
member
of
the
swallow
family
should
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
chapter
xxiii
some
big
mouths
boom
peter
rabbit
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
it
was
all
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
peter
jumped
before
he
had
time
to
think
then
he
looked
foolish
he
felt
foolish
he
had
been
scared
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
ha
ha
ha
ha
tittered
jenny
wren
what
are
you
jumping
for
peter
rabbit
that
was
only
boomer
the
i
know
it
just
as
well
as
you
do
jenny
wren
retorted
peter
rather
crossly
you
know
being
suddenly
startled
is
apt
to
make
people
feel
cross
if
i
had
seen
him
anywhere
about
he
would
have
made
me
jump
it
was
the
unexpectedness
of
it
i
do
see
what
he
is
out
now
for
anyway
it
is
even
dusk
yet
and
i
thought
him
a
night
so
he
is
retorted
jenny
wren
anyway
he
is
a
bird
of
the
evening
and
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
but
just
because
he
likes
the
evening
best
is
any
reason
why
he
should
come
out
in
the
daylight
is
it
replied
peter
rather
slowly
i
do
suppose
it
of
course
it
is
declared
jenny
wren
i
see
boomer
late
in
the
afternoon
nearly
every
day
on
cloudy
days
i
often
see
him
early
in
the
afternoon
he
a
queer
fellow
is
boomer
such
a
mouth
as
he
has
i
suppose
it
is
very
handy
to
have
a
big
mouth
if
one
must
catch
all
food
in
the
air
but
it
certainly
is
pretty
when
it
is
wide
i
never
saw
a
mouth
yet
that
was
pretty
when
it
was
wide
open
retorted
peter
who
was
still
feeling
a
little
put
out
i
never
noticed
that
boomer
has
a
particularly
big
well
he
has
whether
you
noticed
it
or
not
retorted
jenny
wren
sharply
he
got
a
little
bit
of
a
bill
but
a
great
big
mouth
i
do
see
what
folks
call
him
a
hawk
for
when
he
is
a
hawk
at
all
he
is
no
more
of
a
hawk
than
i
am
and
goodness
knows
i
not
even
related
to
the
hawk
i
believe
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
boomer
is
related
to
sooty
the
chimney
swift
said
peter
jenny
nodded
vigorously
so
i
did
peter
she
replied
i
glad
you
have
such
a
good
memory
boomer
and
sooty
are
sort
of
second
cousins
there
is
boomer
now
way
up
in
the
sky
i
do
wish
he
dive
and
scare
some
one
peter
tipped
his
head
back
high
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
was
a
bird
which
at
that
distance
looked
something
like
a
much
overgrown
swallow
he
was
circling
and
darting
about
this
way
and
that
even
while
peter
watched
he
half
closed
his
wings
and
shot
down
with
such
speed
that
peter
actually
held
his
breath
it
looked
very
very
much
as
if
boomer
would
dash
himself
to
pieces
just
before
he
reached
the
earth
he
suddenly
opened
those
wings
and
turned
upward
at
the
instant
he
turned
the
booming
sound
which
had
so
startled
peter
was
heard
it
was
made
by
the
rushing
of
the
wind
through
the
larger
feathers
of
his
wings
as
he
checked
himself
in
this
dive
boomer
had
come
near
enough
for
peter
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
his
coat
seemed
to
be
a
mixture
of
brown
and
gray
very
soft
looking
his
wings
were
brown
with
a
patch
of
white
on
each
there
was
a
white
patch
on
his
throat
and
a
band
of
white
near
the
end
of
his
tail
he
rather
handsome
do
you
think
asked
jenny
wren
he
certainly
is
replied
peter
do
you
happen
to
know
what
kind
of
a
nest
the
nighthawks
build
jenny
they
do
build
jenny
wren
was
a
picture
of
scorn
as
she
said
this
they
do
built
any
nests
at
all
it
ca
be
because
they
are
lazy
for
i
do
know
of
any
birds
that
hunt
harder
for
their
living
than
do
boomer
and
but
if
there
is
any
nest
where
does
boomer
lay
her
eggs
cried
peter
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
jenny
wren
they
must
have
some
kind
of
a
nest
of
course
they
did
i
say
they
do
have
a
nest
sputtered
jenny
mrs
nighthawk
does
lay
but
two
eggs
anyway
perhaps
she
thinks
it
is
worth
while
building
a
nest
for
just
two
eggs
anyway
she
lays
them
on
the
ground
or
on
a
flat
rock
and
lets
it
go
at
that
she
is
quite
as
bad
as
sally
sly
the
cowbird
for
she
does
sit
on
those
eggs
and
she
is
a
good
mother
but
just
think
of
those
nighthawk
children
never
having
any
home
it
does
seem
to
me
right
and
it
never
will
did
you
ever
see
boomer
in
a
tree
peter
shook
his
head
i
seen
him
on
the
ground
said
he
but
i
never
have
seen
him
in
a
tree
why
did
you
ask
jenny
wren
to
find
out
how
well
you
have
used
your
eyes
snapped
jenny
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
had
noticed
anything
peculiar
about
the
way
he
sits
in
a
tree
but
as
long
as
you
have
seen
him
in
a
tree
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
does
sit
as
most
birds
do
he
sits
lengthwise
of
a
branch
he
never
sits
across
it
as
the
rest
of
us
how
funny
exclaimed
peter
i
suppose
that
is
boomer
making
that
queer
noise
we
yes
replied
jenny
he
certainly
does
like
to
use
his
voice
they
tell
me
that
some
folks
call
him
bullbat
though
why
they
should
call
him
either
bat
or
hawk
is
beyond
me
i
suppose
you
know
his
cousin
i
should
say
i
do
replied
peter
he
enough
to
drive
one
crazy
when
he
begins
to
shout
poor
will
close
at
hand
that
voice
of
his
goes
through
me
so
that
i
want
to
stop
both
ears
there
is
a
person
of
my
acquaintance
who
can
say
a
thing
over
and
over
over
and
over
so
many
times
without
stopping
for
breath
do
i
understand
that
he
is
cousin
to
boomer
he
is
a
sort
of
second
cousin
the
same
as
sooty
the
chimney
swift
explained
jenny
wren
they
look
enough
alike
to
be
own
cousins
has
just
the
same
kind
of
a
big
mouth
and
he
is
dressed
very
much
like
boomer
save
that
there
are
no
white
patches
on
his
i
noticed
that
said
peter
that
is
one
way
i
can
tell
them
so
you
noticed
that
much
did
you
cried
jenny
it
does
you
credit
peter
it
does
you
credit
i
wonder
if
you
also
noticed
whiskers
cried
peter
who
ever
heard
of
a
bird
having
whiskers
you
can
stuff
a
lot
down
me
jenny
wren
but
there
are
some
things
i
can
not
swallow
and
bird
whiskers
is
one
of
nobody
asked
you
to
swallow
them
nobody
wants
you
to
swallow
them
snapped
jenny
i
do
know
why
a
bird
should
have
whiskers
just
as
well
as
you
peter
rabbit
anyway
has
them
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
you
believe
in
them
or
not
they
are
there
and
i
guess
finds
them
just
as
useful
as
you
find
yours
and
a
little
more
so
i
know
this
much
that
if
i
had
to
catch
all
my
food
in
the
air
i
want
whiskers
and
lots
of
them
so
that
the
insects
would
get
tangled
in
them
i
suppose
that
what
are
i
beg
your
pardon
jenny
wren
said
peter
very
humbly
of
course
has
whiskers
if
you
say
so
by
the
way
do
the
do
any
better
in
the
matter
of
a
nest
than
the
nighthawks
not
a
bit
replied
jenny
wren
mrs
lays
her
eggs
right
on
the
ground
but
usually
in
the
green
forest
where
it
is
dark
and
lonesome
like
nighthawk
she
lays
only
two
it
the
same
way
with
another
second
cousin
who
cried
peter
wrinkling
his
brows
jenny
wren
fairly
shouted
it
do
you
know
peter
shook
his
head
i
never
heard
of
such
a
bird
he
confessed
that
what
comes
of
never
having
traveled
retorted
jenny
wren
if
you
ever
been
in
the
south
the
way
i
have
you
would
know
he
looks
a
whole
lot
like
the
other
two
we
been
talking
about
but
has
even
a
bigger
mouth
what
more
he
has
whiskers
with
branches
now
you
need
look
as
if
you
doubted
that
peter
rabbit
it
so
in
his
habits
he
just
like
his
cousins
no
nest
and
only
two
eggs
i
never
saw
people
so
afraid
to
raise
a
real
family
if
the
wrens
did
do
better
than
that
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
you
know
jenny
usually
has
a
family
of
six
or
eight
chapter
xxiv
the
warblers
arrive
if
there
is
one
family
of
feathered
friends
which
perplexes
peter
rabbit
more
than
another
it
is
the
warbler
family
so
many
of
them
come
together
and
they
move
about
so
constantly
that
a
fellow
does
have
a
chance
to
look
at
one
long
enough
to
recognize
him
complained
peter
to
jenny
wren
one
morning
when
the
old
orchard
was
fairly
alive
with
little
birds
no
bigger
than
jenny
wren
herself
and
such
restless
little
folks
as
they
were
they
were
not
still
an
instant
flitting
from
tree
to
tree
twig
to
twig
darting
out
into
the
air
and
all
the
time
keeping
up
an
endless
chattering
mingled
with
little
snatches
of
song
peter
would
no
sooner
fix
his
eyes
on
one
than
another
entirely
different
in
appearance
would
take
its
place
occasionally
he
would
see
one
whom
he
recognized
one
who
would
stay
for
the
nesting
season
but
the
majority
of
them
would
stop
only
for
a
day
or
two
being
bound
farther
north
to
make
their
summer
homes
apparently
jenny
wren
did
not
look
upon
them
altogether
with
favor
perhaps
jenny
was
a
little
bit
envious
for
compared
with
the
bright
colors
of
some
of
them
jenny
was
a
very
homely
small
person
indeed
then
too
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
were
so
busy
catching
all
kinds
of
small
insects
that
it
may
be
jenny
was
a
little
fearful
they
would
not
leave
enough
for
her
to
get
her
own
meals
easily
i
do
see
what
they
have
to
stop
here
for
scolded
jenny
they
could
just
as
well
go
somewhere
else
where
they
would
not
be
taking
the
food
out
of
the
mouths
of
honest
folk
who
are
here
to
stay
all
summer
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
such
uneasy
people
they
do
keep
still
an
instant
it
positively
makes
me
tired
just
to
watch
peter
could
help
but
chuckle
for
jenny
wren
herself
is
a
very
restless
and
uneasy
person
as
for
peter
he
was
thoroughly
enjoying
this
visit
of
the
warblers
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
having
no
end
of
trouble
trying
to
tell
who
was
who
suddenly
one
darted
down
and
snapped
up
a
fly
almost
under
peter
very
nose
and
was
back
up
in
a
tree
before
peter
could
get
his
breath
it
zee
zee
the
redstart
cried
peter
joyously
i
would
know
zee
zee
anywhere
do
you
know
who
he
reminds
me
of
jenny
wren
who
demanded
jenny
goldy
the
oriole
replied
peter
promptly
only
of
course
he
ever
and
ever
so
much
smaller
he
all
black
and
and
white
something
as
goldy
is
only
there
is
quite
so
much
orange
on
for
just
an
instant
zee
zee
sat
still
with
his
tail
spread
his
head
throat
and
back
were
black
and
there
was
a
black
band
across
the
end
of
his
tail
and
a
black
stripe
down
the
middle
of
it
the
rest
was
bright
on
each
wing
was
a
band
of
and
his
sides
were
the
same
color
underneath
he
was
white
tinged
more
or
less
with
orange
it
was
only
for
an
instant
that
zee
zee
sat
still
then
he
was
in
the
air
darting
diving
whirling
going
through
all
sorts
of
antics
as
he
caught
tiny
insects
too
small
for
peter
to
see
peter
began
to
wonder
how
he
kept
still
long
enough
to
sleep
at
night
and
his
voice
was
quite
as
busy
as
his
wings
zee
zee
zee
zee
he
would
cry
but
this
was
only
one
of
many
notes
at
times
he
would
sing
a
beautiful
little
song
and
then
again
it
would
seem
as
if
he
were
trying
to
imitate
other
members
of
the
warbler
family
i
do
hope
zee
zee
is
going
to
stay
here
said
peter
i
just
love
to
watch
he
stay
fast
enough
retorted
jenny
wren
i
do
imagine
stay
in
the
old
orchard
and
i
hope
he
wo
because
if
he
does
it
will
make
it
just
that
much
harder
for
me
to
catch
enough
to
feed
my
big
family
probably
he
and
redstart
will
make
their
home
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
they
like
it
better
over
there
for
which
i
am
thankful
there
mrs
redstart
now
just
notice
that
where
zee
zee
is
bright
red
she
is
yellow
and
instead
of
a
black
head
she
has
a
gray
head
and
her
back
is
with
a
grayish
tinge
she
nearly
as
handsome
as
zee
zee
but
then
that
not
to
be
expected
she
lets
zee
zee
do
the
singing
and
the
showing
off
and
she
does
the
work
i
expect
she
build
that
nest
with
almost
no
help
at
all
from
him
but
zee
zee
is
a
good
father
i
say
that
much
for
him
he
do
his
share
in
feeding
their
just
then
peter
caught
sight
of
a
bird
all
in
yellow
he
was
about
the
same
size
as
zee
zee
and
was
flitting
about
among
the
bushes
along
the
old
stone
wall
there
sunshine
cried
peter
and
without
being
polite
enough
to
even
bid
jenny
wren
farewell
he
scampered
over
to
where
he
could
see
the
one
he
called
sunshine
flitting
about
from
bush
to
bush
oh
sunshine
he
cried
as
he
came
within
speaking
distance
i
ever
and
ever
so
glad
to
see
you
back
i
do
hope
you
and
sunshine
are
going
to
make
your
home
somewhere
near
here
where
i
can
see
you
every
hello
peter
i
am
just
as
glad
to
see
you
as
you
are
to
see
me
cried
sunshine
the
yellow
warbler
yes
indeed
we
certainly
intend
to
stay
here
if
we
can
find
just
the
right
place
for
our
nest
it
is
lovely
to
be
back
here
again
we
journeyed
so
far
that
we
do
want
to
go
a
bit
farther
if
we
can
help
it
have
you
seen
sally
sly
the
cowbird
around
here
this
spring
peter
nodded
yes
said
he
i
i
sorry
to
hear
it
declared
sunshine
she
made
us
a
lot
of
trouble
last
year
but
we
fooled
how
did
you
fool
her
asked
peter
sunshine
paused
to
pick
a
tiny
worm
from
a
leaf
well
said
he
she
found
our
nest
just
after
we
had
finished
it
and
before
sunshine
had
had
a
chance
to
lay
an
egg
of
course
you
know
what
she
i
can
guess
replied
peter
she
laid
one
of
her
own
eggs
in
your
sunshine
stopped
to
pick
two
or
three
more
worms
from
the
leaves
yes
said
he
she
did
just
that
the
lazy
creature
but
it
did
do
her
a
bit
of
good
not
a
bit
that
egg
never
hatched
we
fooled
her
and
that
what
we
do
again
if
she
repeats
that
trick
this
what
did
you
do
throw
that
egg
out
asked
peter
no
replied
sunshine
our
nest
was
too
deep
for
us
to
get
that
egg
out
we
just
made
a
second
bottom
in
our
nest
right
over
that
egg
and
built
the
sides
of
the
nest
a
little
higher
then
we
took
good
care
that
she
did
have
a
chance
to
lay
another
egg
in
then
you
had
a
regular
nest
did
you
cried
peter
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
sunshine
nodded
yes
sir
said
he
and
it
was
a
mighty
fine
nest
if
i
do
say
it
if
there
anything
sunshine
and
i
pride
ourselves
on
it
is
our
nest
there
are
no
babies
who
have
a
softer
cozier
home
than
what
do
you
make
your
nest
of
asked
peter
fine
grasses
and
soft
fibers
from
plants
some
hair
when
we
can
find
it
and
a
few
feathers
but
we
always
use
a
lot
of
that
nice
soft
there
is
nothing
softer
or
nicer
that
i
know
all
the
time
peter
had
been
admiring
sunshine
and
thinking
how
wonderfully
well
he
was
named
at
first
glance
he
seemed
to
be
all
yellow
as
if
somehow
he
had
managed
to
catch
and
hold
the
sunshine
in
his
feathers
there
was
a
white
feather
on
him
when
he
came
very
close
peter
could
see
that
on
his
breast
and
underneath
were
little
streaks
of
reddish
brown
and
his
wings
and
tail
were
a
little
blackish
otherwise
he
was
all
yellow
presently
he
was
joined
by
sunshine
she
was
not
such
a
bright
yellow
as
was
sunshine
having
an
tint
on
her
back
but
underneath
she
was
almost
clear
yellow
without
the
streaks
she
too
was
glad
to
see
peter
but
could
stop
to
gossip
for
already
as
she
informed
sunshine
she
had
found
just
the
place
for
their
nest
of
course
peter
begged
to
be
told
where
it
was
but
the
two
little
folks
in
yellow
snapped
their
bright
eyes
at
him
and
told
him
that
that
was
their
secret
and
they
did
propose
to
tell
a
living
soul
perhaps
if
peter
had
not
been
so
curious
and
eager
to
get
acquainted
with
other
members
of
the
warbler
family
he
would
have
stayed
and
done
a
little
spying
as
it
was
he
promised
himself
to
come
back
to
look
for
that
nest
after
it
had
been
built
then
he
scurried
back
among
the
trees
of
the
old
orchard
to
look
for
other
friends
among
the
busy
little
warblers
who
were
making
the
old
orchard
such
a
lively
place
that
morning
there
one
thing
about
it
cried
peter
any
one
can
tell
zee
zee
the
redstart
by
his
black
and
flame
colored
suit
there
is
no
other
like
it
and
any
one
can
tell
sunshine
the
yellow
warbler
because
there
anybody
else
who
seems
to
be
all
yellow
my
what
a
lively
lovely
lot
these
warblers
are
chapter
xxv
three
cousins
quite
unlike
as
peter
rabbit
passed
one
of
the
in
the
old
orchard
a
thin
wiry
voice
hailed
him
it
a
wonder
you
would
at
least
say
you
glad
to
see
me
back
peter
rabbit
said
the
voice
peter
who
had
been
hopping
along
rather
fast
stopped
abruptly
to
look
up
running
along
a
limb
just
over
his
head
now
on
top
and
now
underneath
was
a
little
bird
with
a
black
and
white
striped
coat
and
a
white
waistcoat
just
as
peter
looked
it
flew
down
to
near
the
base
of
the
tree
and
began
to
run
straight
up
the
trunk
picking
things
from
the
bark
here
and
there
as
it
ran
its
way
of
going
up
that
tree
trunk
reminded
peter
of
one
of
his
winter
friends
seep
seep
the
brown
creeper
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
a
mighty
poor
welcome
for
one
who
has
just
come
all
the
way
from
south
america
said
the
little
black
and
white
bird
with
twinkling
eyes
oh
creeper
i
did
know
you
were
here
cried
peter
you
know
glad
to
see
you
i
just
as
glad
as
glad
can
be
you
are
such
a
quiet
fellow
i
afraid
i
should
have
seen
you
at
all
if
you
had
spoken
you
know
it
always
been
hard
work
for
me
to
believe
that
you
are
really
and
truly
a
why
so
demanded
creeper
the
black
and
white
warbler
for
that
is
the
name
by
which
he
is
commonly
known
why
so
do
i
look
like
a
warbler
said
peter
slowly
you
do
look
like
one
but
you
do
act
like
in
what
way
do
i
act
like
one
i
should
like
to
know
demanded
creeper
well
replied
peter
all
the
rest
of
the
warblers
are
the
uneasiest
folks
i
know
of
they
ca
seem
to
keep
still
a
minute
they
are
everlastingly
flitting
about
this
way
and
that
way
and
the
other
way
i
actually
get
tired
watching
them
but
you
are
not
a
bit
that
way
then
the
way
you
run
up
tree
trunks
and
along
the
limbs
is
a
bit
why
do
you
flit
and
dart
about
as
the
others
do
creeper
bright
eyes
sparkled
i
do
have
to
said
he
i
going
to
let
you
into
a
little
secret
peter
the
rest
of
them
get
their
living
from
the
leaves
and
twigs
and
in
the
air
but
i
discovered
an
easier
way
i
found
out
that
there
are
lots
of
little
worms
and
insects
and
eggs
on
the
trunks
and
big
limbs
of
the
trees
and
that
i
can
get
the
best
kind
of
a
living
there
without
flitting
about
everlastingly
i
do
have
to
share
them
with
anybody
but
the
woodpeckers
nuthatches
and
tommy
tit
the
that
reminds
me
said
peter
those
folks
you
have
mentioned
nest
in
holes
in
trees
do
you
i
should
say
not
retorted
creeper
i
do
know
of
any
warbler
who
does
i
build
on
the
ground
if
you
want
to
know
i
nest
in
the
green
forest
sometimes
i
make
my
nest
in
a
little
hollow
at
the
base
of
a
tree
sometimes
i
put
it
under
a
stump
or
rock
or
tuck
it
in
under
the
roots
of
a
tree
that
has
been
blown
over
but
there
peter
rabbit
talked
enough
i
glad
you
glad
that
i
back
and
i
glad
i
back
creeper
continued
on
up
the
trunk
of
the
tree
picking
here
and
picking
there
just
then
peter
caught
sight
of
another
friend
whom
he
could
always
tell
by
the
black
mask
he
wore
it
was
mummer
the
he
had
just
darted
into
the
thicket
of
bushes
along
the
old
stone
wall
peter
promptly
hurried
over
there
to
look
for
him
when
peter
reached
the
place
where
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
mummer
no
one
was
to
be
seen
peter
sat
down
uncertain
which
way
to
go
suddenly
mummer
popped
out
right
in
front
of
peter
seemingly
from
nowhere
at
all
his
throat
and
breast
were
bright
yellow
and
his
back
wings
and
tail
a
soft
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
him
was
the
mask
of
black
right
across
his
cheeks
eyes
and
forehead
at
least
it
looked
like
a
mask
although
it
really
was
one
hello
mummer
cried
peter
hello
yourself
peter
rabbit
retorted
mummer
and
then
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
had
appeared
peter
blinked
and
looked
in
vain
all
about
looking
for
some
one
asked
mummer
suddenly
popping
into
view
where
peter
least
expected
him
for
goodness
sake
ca
you
sit
still
a
minute
cried
peter
how
do
you
expect
a
fellow
can
talk
to
you
when
he
ca
keep
his
eyes
on
you
more
than
two
seconds
at
a
who
asked
you
to
talk
to
me
responded
mummer
and
popped
out
of
sight
two
seconds
later
he
was
back
again
and
his
bright
little
eyes
fairly
shone
with
mischief
then
before
peter
could
say
a
word
mummer
burst
into
a
pleasant
little
song
he
was
so
full
of
happiness
that
peter
could
be
cross
with
him
there
one
thing
i
like
about
you
mummer
declared
peter
and
that
is
that
i
never
get
you
mixed
up
with
anybody
else
i
should
know
you
just
as
far
as
i
could
see
you
because
of
that
black
mask
across
your
face
has
arrived
yet
certainly
replied
another
voice
and
flitted
across
right
in
front
of
peter
for
just
a
second
she
sat
still
long
enough
for
him
to
have
one
good
look
at
her
she
was
dressed
very
like
mummer
save
that
she
did
not
wear
the
black
mask
peter
was
just
about
to
say
something
polite
and
pleasant
when
from
just
back
of
him
there
sounded
a
loud
very
emphatic
chut
chut
peter
whirled
about
to
find
another
old
friend
it
was
the
chat
the
largest
of
the
warbler
family
he
was
so
much
bigger
than
mummer
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
own
cousins
but
peter
knew
they
were
and
he
also
knew
that
he
could
never
mistake
for
any
other
member
of
the
family
because
of
his
big
size
which
was
that
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
sparrow
family
his
back
was
a
dark
but
his
throat
and
breast
were
a
beautiful
bright
yellow
there
was
a
broad
white
line
above
each
eye
and
a
little
white
line
underneath
below
his
breast
he
was
all
white
to
have
seen
him
you
would
have
thought
that
he
suspected
peter
might
do
him
some
harm
he
acted
that
way
if
peter
had
known
him
so
well
he
might
have
been
offended
but
peter
knew
that
there
is
no
one
among
his
feathered
friends
more
cautious
than
the
chat
he
never
takes
anything
for
granted
he
appears
to
be
always
on
the
watch
for
danger
even
to
the
extent
of
suspecting
his
very
best
friends
when
he
had
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
there
was
no
danger
came
out
for
a
little
gossip
but
like
all
the
rest
of
the
warblers
he
could
keep
still
right
in
the
middle
of
the
story
of
his
travels
from
mexico
he
flew
to
the
top
of
a
little
tree
began
to
sing
then
flew
out
into
the
air
with
his
legs
dangling
and
his
tail
wagging
up
and
down
in
the
funniest
way
and
there
continued
his
song
as
he
slowly
dropped
down
into
the
thicket
again
it
was
a
beautiful
song
and
peter
hastened
to
tell
him
so
was
pleased
he
showed
it
by
giving
a
little
concert
all
by
himself
it
seemed
to
peter
that
he
never
had
heard
such
a
variety
of
whistles
and
calls
and
songs
as
came
from
that
yellow
throat
when
it
was
over
abruptly
said
and
disappeared
peter
could
hear
his
sharp
chut
chut
farther
along
in
the
thicket
as
he
hunted
for
worms
among
the
bushes
i
wonder
said
peter
speaking
out
loud
without
thinking
where
he
builds
his
nest
i
wonder
if
he
builds
it
on
the
ground
the
way
creeper
no
declared
mummer
who
all
the
time
had
been
darting
about
close
at
hand
he
does
but
i
do
puts
his
nest
near
the
ground
however
usually
within
two
or
three
feet
he
builds
it
in
bushes
or
briars
sometimes
if
i
can
find
a
good
tangle
of
briars
i
build
my
nest
in
it
several
feet
from
the
ground
but
as
a
rule
i
would
rather
have
it
on
the
ground
under
a
bush
or
in
a
clump
of
weeds
have
you
seen
my
cousin
sprite
the
parula
warbler
yet
not
yet
said
peter
as
he
started
for
home
chapter
xxvi
peter
gets
a
lame
neck
for
several
days
it
seemed
to
peter
rabbit
that
everywhere
he
went
he
found
members
of
the
warbler
family
being
anxious
to
know
all
of
them
he
did
his
best
to
remember
how
each
one
looked
but
there
were
so
many
and
some
of
them
were
dressed
so
nearly
alike
that
after
awhile
peter
became
so
mixed
that
he
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
then
as
suddenly
as
they
had
appeared
the
warblers
disappeared
that
is
to
say
most
of
them
disappeared
you
see
they
had
only
stopped
for
a
visit
being
on
their
way
farther
north
in
his
interest
in
the
affairs
of
others
of
his
feathered
friends
peter
had
quite
forgotten
the
warblers
then
one
day
when
he
was
in
the
green
forest
where
the
grow
he
stopped
to
rest
this
particular
part
of
the
green
forest
was
low
and
damp
and
on
many
of
the
trees
gray
moss
grew
hanging
down
from
the
branches
and
making
the
trees
look
much
older
than
they
really
were
peter
was
staring
at
a
hanging
branch
of
this
moss
without
thinking
anything
about
it
when
suddenly
a
little
bird
alighted
on
it
and
disappeared
in
it
at
least
that
is
what
peter
thought
but
it
was
all
so
unexpected
that
he
could
be
sure
his
eyes
had
fooled
him
of
course
right
away
he
became
very
much
interested
in
that
bunch
of
moss
he
stared
at
it
very
hard
at
first
it
looked
no
different
from
a
dozen
other
bunches
of
moss
but
presently
he
noticed
that
it
was
a
little
thicker
than
other
bunches
as
if
somehow
it
had
been
woven
together
he
hopped
off
to
one
side
so
he
could
see
better
it
looked
as
if
in
one
side
of
that
bunch
of
moss
was
a
little
round
hole
peter
blinked
and
looked
very
hard
indeed
to
make
sure
a
minute
later
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
for
a
little
feathered
head
was
poked
out
and
a
second
later
a
dainty
mite
of
a
bird
flew
out
and
alighted
very
close
to
peter
it
was
one
of
the
smaller
members
of
the
warbler
family
sprite
cried
peter
joyously
i
missed
you
when
your
cousins
passed
through
here
and
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
the
far
north
with
the
rest
of
well
i
have
and
what
more
i
not
going
to
go
on
to
the
far
north
i
going
to
stay
right
here
declared
sprite
the
parula
warbler
for
that
is
who
it
was
as
peter
looked
at
sprite
he
could
help
thinking
that
there
a
daintier
member
in
the
whole
warbler
family
his
coat
was
of
a
soft
bluish
color
with
a
yellowish
patch
in
the
very
center
of
his
back
across
each
wing
were
two
bars
of
white
his
throat
was
yellow
just
beneath
it
was
a
little
band
of
his
breast
was
yellow
and
his
sides
were
grayish
and
sprite
you
just
beautiful
declared
peter
in
frank
admiration
what
was
the
reason
i
did
see
you
up
in
the
old
orchard
with
your
cousins
because
i
was
there
was
sprite
prompt
reply
as
he
flitted
about
quite
unable
to
sit
still
a
minute
i
was
there
because
i
like
the
green
forest
better
so
i
came
straight
what
were
you
doing
just
now
in
that
bunch
of
moss
demanded
peter
a
sudden
suspicion
of
the
truth
hopping
into
his
head
just
looking
it
over
replied
sprite
trying
to
look
innocent
at
that
very
instant
peter
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
a
tail
disappearing
in
the
little
round
hole
in
the
side
of
the
bunch
of
moss
he
knew
that
that
tail
belonged
to
sprite
and
just
that
glimpse
told
him
all
he
wanted
to
know
you
got
a
nest
in
there
peter
exclaimed
excitedly
there
no
use
denying
it
sprite
you
got
a
nest
in
there
what
a
perfectly
lovely
place
for
a
sprite
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
quite
useless
to
try
to
deceive
peter
yes
said
he
mrs
sprite
and
i
have
a
nest
in
there
just
finished
it
i
think
myself
it
is
rather
nice
we
always
build
in
moss
like
this
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
a
nice
thick
bunch
and
then
weave
it
together
at
the
bottom
and
line
the
inside
with
fine
grasses
it
looks
so
much
like
all
the
rest
of
the
bunches
of
moss
that
it
is
seldom
any
one
finds
it
i
would
trade
nests
with
anybody
i
is
it
rather
lonesome
over
here
by
yourselves
asked
peter
not
at
all
replied
sprite
you
see
we
are
not
as
much
alone
as
you
think
my
cousin
fidget
the
myrtle
warbler
is
nesting
not
very
far
away
and
another
cousin
weechi
the
magnolia
warbler
is
also
quite
near
both
have
begun
housekeeping
of
course
peter
was
all
excitement
and
interest
at
once
where
are
their
homes
he
asked
eagerly
tell
me
where
they
are
and
i
go
straight
over
and
peter
said
sprite
severely
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
ask
me
to
tell
you
anything
of
this
kind
you
have
been
around
enough
to
know
that
there
is
no
secret
so
precious
as
the
secret
of
a
home
you
happened
to
find
mine
and
i
guess
i
can
trust
you
not
to
tell
anybody
where
it
is
if
you
can
find
the
homes
of
fidget
and
weechi
all
right
but
i
certainly
do
intend
to
tell
you
where
they
peter
knew
that
sprite
was
quite
right
in
refusing
to
tell
the
secrets
of
his
cousins
but
he
could
think
of
going
home
without
at
least
looking
for
those
homes
he
tried
to
look
very
innocent
as
he
asked
if
they
also
were
in
hanging
bunches
of
moss
but
sprite
was
too
smart
to
be
fooled
and
peter
learned
nothing
at
all
for
some
time
peter
hopped
around
this
way
and
that
way
thinking
every
bunch
of
moss
he
saw
must
surely
contain
a
nest
but
though
he
looked
and
looked
and
looked
not
another
little
round
hole
did
he
find
and
there
were
so
many
bunches
of
moss
that
finally
his
neck
ached
from
tipping
his
head
back
so
much
now
peter
has
much
patience
as
he
might
have
so
after
a
while
he
gave
up
the
search
and
started
on
his
way
home
on
higher
ground
just
above
the
low
swampy
place
where
grew
the
trees
he
came
to
a
lot
of
young
these
had
no
moss
on
them
having
given
up
his
search
peter
was
thinking
of
other
things
when
there
flitted
across
in
front
of
him
a
black
and
gray
bird
with
a
yellow
cap
yellow
sides
and
a
yellow
patch
at
the
root
of
his
tail
those
yellow
patches
were
all
peter
needed
to
see
to
recognize
fidget
the
myrtle
warbler
one
of
the
two
friends
he
had
been
so
long
looking
for
down
among
the
trees
oh
fidget
cried
peter
hurrying
after
the
restless
little
bird
oh
fidget
i
been
looking
everywhere
for
well
here
i
am
retorted
fidget
you
did
look
everywhere
or
you
would
have
found
me
before
what
can
i
do
for
you
all
the
time
fidget
was
hopping
and
flitting
about
never
still
an
instant
you
can
tell
me
where
your
nest
is
replied
peter
promptly
i
can
but
i
wo
retorted
fidget
now
honestly
peter
do
you
think
you
have
any
business
to
ask
such
a
question
peter
hung
his
head
and
then
replied
quite
honestly
no
i
do
fidget
but
you
see
sprite
told
me
that
you
had
a
nest
not
very
far
from
his
and
i
looked
at
bunches
of
moss
until
i
got
a
crick
in
the
back
of
my
bunches
of
moss
exclaimed
fidget
what
under
the
sun
do
you
think
i
have
to
do
with
bunches
of
moss
why
why
i
just
thought
you
probably
had
your
nest
in
one
the
same
as
your
cousin
fidget
laughed
right
out
i
afraid
you
would
have
a
worse
crick
in
the
back
of
your
neck
than
you
got
now
before
ever
you
found
my
nest
in
a
bunch
of
moss
said
he
moss
may
suit
my
cousin
sprite
but
it
does
suit
me
at
all
besides
i
do
like
those
dark
places
where
the
moss
grows
on
the
trees
i
build
my
nest
of
twigs
and
grass
and
and
i
line
it
with
hair
and
rootlets
and
feathers
sometimes
i
bind
it
together
with
spider
silk
and
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
like
a
little
to
put
it
in
it
is
very
far
from
here
but
where
it
is
i
not
going
to
tell
you
have
you
seen
my
cousin
weechi
no
replied
peter
is
he
anywhere
around
here
right
here
replied
another
voice
and
weechi
the
magnolia
warbler
dropped
down
on
the
ground
for
just
a
second
right
in
front
of
peter
the
top
of
his
head
and
the
back
of
his
neck
were
gray
above
his
eye
was
a
white
stripe
and
his
cheeks
were
black
his
throat
was
clear
yellow
just
below
which
was
a
black
band
from
this
black
streaks
ran
down
across
his
yellow
breast
at
the
root
of
his
tail
he
was
yellow
his
tail
was
mostly
black
on
top
and
white
underneath
his
wings
were
black
and
gray
with
two
white
bars
he
was
a
little
smaller
than
fidget
the
myrtle
warbler
and
quite
as
restless
peter
fairly
itched
to
ask
weechi
where
his
nest
was
but
by
this
time
he
had
learned
a
lesson
so
wisely
kept
his
tongue
still
what
were
you
fellows
talking
about
asked
weechi
nests
replied
fidget
i
just
been
telling
peter
that
while
cousin
sprite
may
like
to
build
in
that
hanging
moss
down
there
it
suit
me
at
nor
me
either
declared
weechi
promptly
i
prefer
to
build
a
real
nest
just
as
you
do
by
the
way
fidget
i
stopped
to
look
at
your
nest
this
morning
i
find
we
build
a
good
deal
alike
and
we
like
the
same
sort
of
a
place
to
put
it
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
am
a
rather
near
neighbor
of
yours
of
course
i
know
it
replied
fidget
in
fact
i
watched
you
start
your
nest
do
you
think
you
have
it
rather
near
the
ground
not
too
near
fidget
not
too
near
i
am
not
as
as
some
people
i
like
to
be
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
i
do
myself
replied
fidget
fidget
and
weechi
became
so
interested
in
discussing
nests
and
the
proper
way
of
building
them
they
quite
forgot
peter
rabbit
peter
sat
around
for
a
while
listening
but
being
more
interested
in
seeing
those
nests
than
hearing
about
them
he
finally
stole
away
to
look
for
them
he
looked
and
looked
but
there
were
so
many
young
and
they
looked
so
much
alike
that
finally
peter
lost
patience
and
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
chapter
xxvii
a
new
friend
and
an
old
one
peter
rabbit
never
will
forget
the
first
time
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
glory
the
cardinal
sometimes
called
redbird
he
had
come
up
to
the
old
orchard
for
his
usual
morning
visit
and
just
as
he
hopped
over
the
old
stone
wall
he
heard
a
beautiful
clear
loud
whistle
which
drew
his
eyes
to
the
top
of
an
peter
stopped
short
with
a
little
gasp
of
sheer
astonishment
and
delight
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
he
could
quite
believe
that
he
saw
what
he
thought
he
saw
he
had
supposed
that
any
one
even
among
the
feathered
folks
could
be
quite
so
beautiful
the
stranger
was
dressed
all
in
red
excepting
a
little
black
around
the
base
of
his
bill
even
his
bill
was
red
he
wore
a
beautiful
red
crest
which
made
him
still
more
distinguished
looking
and
how
he
could
sing
peter
had
noticed
that
quite
often
the
most
beautifully
dressed
birds
have
the
poorest
songs
but
this
stranger
song
was
as
beautiful
as
his
coat
and
that
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
if
not
the
most
beautiful
that
peter
ever
had
seen
of
course
he
lost
no
time
in
hunting
up
jenny
wren
who
is
it
jenny
who
is
that
beautiful
stranger
with
such
a
lovely
song
cried
peter
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
jenny
it
glory
the
cardinal
replied
jenny
wren
promptly
is
he
the
loveliest
thing
you
ever
seen
i
do
hope
he
is
going
to
stay
here
as
i
said
before
i
do
often
envy
any
one
fine
clothes
but
when
i
see
glory
i
sometimes
tempted
to
be
envious
if
i
were
cardinal
afraid
i
should
be
jealous
there
she
is
in
the
very
same
tree
with
him
did
you
ever
see
such
a
difference
peter
looked
eagerly
instead
of
the
glorious
red
of
glory
cardinal
wore
a
very
dull
dress
her
back
was
a
her
throat
was
a
her
breast
was
a
dull
buff
with
a
faint
tinge
of
red
her
wings
and
tail
were
tinged
with
dull
red
altogether
she
was
very
soberly
dressed
but
a
trim
neat
looking
little
person
but
if
she
was
handsomely
dressed
she
could
sing
in
fact
she
was
almost
as
good
a
singer
as
her
handsome
husband
i
noticed
said
peter
that
people
with
fine
clothes
spend
most
of
their
time
thinking
about
them
and
are
of
very
little
use
when
it
comes
to
real
work
in
well
you
need
think
that
of
glory
declared
jenny
in
her
vigorous
way
he
just
as
fine
as
he
is
handsome
he
a
model
husband
if
they
make
their
home
around
here
you
find
him
doing
his
full
share
in
the
care
of
their
babies
sometimes
they
raise
two
families
when
they
do
that
glory
takes
charge
of
the
first
lot
of
youngsters
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
leave
the
nest
so
that
cardinal
has
nothing
to
worry
about
while
she
is
sitting
on
the
second
lot
of
eggs
he
fusses
over
them
as
if
they
were
the
only
children
in
the
world
everybody
loves
glory
excuse
me
peter
i
going
over
to
find
out
if
they
are
really
going
to
when
jenny
returned
she
was
so
excited
she
could
keep
still
a
minute
they
like
here
peter
she
cried
they
like
here
so
much
that
if
they
can
find
a
place
to
suit
them
for
a
nest
they
going
to
stay
i
told
them
that
it
is
the
very
best
place
in
the
world
they
like
an
evergreen
tree
to
build
in
and
i
think
they
got
their
eyes
on
those
evergreens
up
near
farmer
brown
house
my
they
will
add
a
lot
to
the
quality
of
this
and
cardinal
whistled
and
sang
as
if
their
hearts
were
bursting
with
joy
and
peter
sat
around
listening
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
do
probably
he
would
have
sat
there
the
rest
of
the
morning
had
he
not
caught
sight
of
an
old
friend
of
whom
he
is
very
fond
kitty
the
catbird
in
contrast
with
glory
kitty
seemed
a
regular
little
quaker
for
he
was
dressed
almost
wholly
in
gray
a
rather
dark
the
top
of
his
head
and
tail
were
black
and
right
at
the
base
of
his
tail
was
a
patch
of
chestnut
color
he
was
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
there
was
no
danger
of
mistaking
him
for
anybody
else
for
there
is
no
one
dressed
at
all
like
him
peter
forgot
all
about
glory
in
his
pleasure
at
discovering
the
returned
kitty
and
hurried
over
to
welcome
him
kitty
had
disappeared
among
the
bushes
along
the
old
stone
wall
but
peter
had
no
trouble
in
finding
him
by
the
queer
cries
he
was
uttering
which
were
very
like
the
meow
of
black
pussy
the
cat
they
were
very
harsh
and
unpleasant
and
peter
understood
perfectly
why
their
maker
is
called
the
catbird
he
did
not
hurry
in
among
the
bushes
at
once
but
waited
expectantly
in
a
few
minutes
the
harsh
cries
ceased
and
then
there
came
from
the
very
same
place
a
song
which
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
parts
of
the
songs
of
all
the
other
birds
of
the
old
orchard
it
was
not
loud
but
it
was
charming
it
contained
the
clear
whistle
of
glory
and
there
was
even
the
tinkle
of
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
the
notes
of
other
friends
were
in
that
song
and
with
them
were
notes
of
southern
birds
whose
songs
kitty
had
learned
while
spending
the
winter
in
the
south
then
there
were
notes
all
his
own
peter
listened
until
the
song
ended
then
scampered
in
among
the
bushes
at
once
those
harsh
cries
broke
out
again
you
would
have
thought
that
kitty
was
scolding
peter
for
coming
to
see
him
instead
of
being
glad
but
that
was
just
kitty
way
he
is
simply
brimming
over
with
fun
and
mischief
and
delights
to
pretend
when
peter
found
him
he
was
sitting
with
all
his
feathers
puffed
out
until
he
looked
almost
like
a
ball
with
a
head
and
tail
he
looked
positively
sleepy
then
as
he
caught
sight
of
peter
he
drew
those
feathers
down
tight
cocked
his
tail
up
after
the
manner
of
jenny
wren
and
was
as
slim
and
trim
looking
as
any
bird
of
peter
acquaintance
he
did
look
at
all
like
the
same
bird
of
the
moment
before
then
he
dropped
his
tail
as
if
he
had
strength
enough
to
hold
it
up
at
all
it
hung
straight
down
he
dropped
his
wings
and
all
in
a
second
made
himself
look
fairly
disreputable
but
all
the
time
his
eyes
were
twinkling
and
snapping
and
peter
knew
that
these
changes
in
appearance
were
made
out
of
pure
fun
and
mischief
i
been
wondering
if
you
were
coming
hack
cried
peter
i
know
of
any
one
of
my
feathered
friends
i
would
miss
so
much
as
thank
you
responded
kitty
it
very
nice
of
you
to
say
that
peter
if
you
are
glad
to
see
me
i
am
still
more
glad
to
get
did
you
pass
a
pleasant
winter
down
south
asked
peter
fairly
so
fairly
so
replied
kitty
by
the
way
peter
i
picked
up
some
new
songs
down
there
would
you
like
to
hear
them
of
course
replied
peter
but
i
do
think
you
need
any
new
songs
i
never
seen
such
a
fellow
for
picking
up
other
people
songs
excepting
mocker
the
at
the
mention
of
mocker
a
little
cloud
crossed
kitty
face
for
just
an
instant
there
a
fellow
i
really
envy
said
he
i
pretty
good
at
imitating
others
but
mocker
is
better
i
hoping
that
if
i
practice
enough
some
day
i
can
be
as
good
i
saw
a
lot
of
him
in
the
south
and
he
certainly
is
huh
you
do
need
to
envy
him
retorted
peter
you
are
some
imitator
yourself
how
about
those
new
notes
you
got
when
you
were
in
the
south
kitty
face
cleared
his
throat
swelled
and
he
began
to
sing
it
was
a
regular
medley
it
did
seem
as
if
so
many
notes
could
come
from
one
throat
when
it
ended
peter
had
a
question
all
ready
are
you
going
to
build
somewhere
near
here
he
asked
i
certainly
am
replied
kitty
mrs
catbird
was
delayed
a
day
or
two
i
hope
she
get
here
and
then
we
get
busy
at
once
i
think
we
shall
build
in
these
bushes
here
somewhere
i
glad
farmer
brown
has
sense
enough
to
let
them
grow
they
are
just
the
kind
of
a
place
i
like
for
a
nest
they
are
near
enough
to
farmer
brown
garden
and
the
old
orchard
is
right
here
that
just
the
kind
of
a
combination
that
suits
peter
looked
somewhat
uncertain
why
do
you
want
to
be
near
farmer
brown
garden
he
asked
because
that
is
where
i
will
get
a
good
part
of
my
living
kitty
responded
promptly
he
ought
to
be
glad
to
have
me
about
once
in
a
while
i
take
a
little
fruit
but
i
pay
for
it
ten
times
over
by
the
number
of
bugs
and
worms
i
get
in
his
garden
and
the
old
orchard
i
pride
myself
on
being
useful
there
nothing
like
being
useful
in
this
world
peter
nodded
as
if
he
quite
agreed
though
as
you
know
and
i
know
peter
himself
does
very
little
except
fill
his
own
big
stomach
chapter
xxviii
peter
sees
rosebreast
and
finds
redcoat
who
that
peter
rabbit
pricked
up
his
long
ears
and
stared
up
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
of
the
old
orchard
instantly
jenny
wren
popped
her
head
out
of
her
doorway
she
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
to
listen
then
looked
down
at
peter
and
her
sharp
little
eyes
snapped
i
do
hear
any
strange
voice
said
she
the
way
you
are
staring
peter
rabbit
one
would
think
that
you
had
really
heard
something
new
and
worth
just
then
there
were
two
or
three
rather
sharp
squeaky
notes
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
trees
there
cried
peter
there
did
you
hear
that
jenny
wren
for
goodness
sake
peter
rabbit
you
do
mean
to
say
you
know
whose
voice
that
is
she
cried
that
rosebreast
he
and
rosebreast
have
been
here
for
quite
a
little
while
i
did
suppose
there
was
any
one
who
did
know
those
sharp
squeaky
voices
they
rather
get
on
my
nerves
what
anybody
wants
to
squeak
like
that
for
when
they
can
sing
as
rosebreast
can
is
more
than
i
can
at
that
very
instant
wren
began
to
scold
as
only
he
and
jenny
can
peter
looked
up
at
jenny
and
winked
slyly
and
what
anybody
wants
to
scold
like
that
for
when
they
can
sing
as
wren
can
is
too
much
for
me
retorted
peter
but
you
have
told
me
who
rosebreast
the
grosbeak
of
course
stupid
sputtered
jenny
if
you
do
know
rosebreast
the
grosbeak
peter
rabbit
you
certainly
must
have
been
blind
and
deaf
ever
since
you
were
born
listen
to
that
just
listen
to
that
song
peter
listened
there
were
many
songs
for
it
was
a
very
beautiful
morning
and
all
the
singers
of
the
old
orchard
were
pouring
out
the
joy
that
was
within
them
one
song
was
a
little
louder
and
clearer
than
the
others
because
it
came
from
a
tree
very
close
at
hand
the
very
tree
from
which
those
squeaky
notes
had
come
just
a
few
minutes
before
peter
suspected
that
that
must
be
the
song
jenny
wren
meant
he
looked
puzzled
he
was
puzzled
do
you
mean
welcome
robin
song
he
asked
rather
sheepishly
for
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
would
be
the
victim
of
jenny
wren
sharp
tongue
no
i
do
mean
welcome
robin
song
snapped
jenny
what
good
are
a
pair
of
long
ears
if
they
ca
tell
one
song
from
another
that
song
may
sound
something
like
welcome
robin
but
if
your
ears
were
good
for
anything
at
all
you
know
right
away
that
that
is
welcome
robin
singing
that
a
better
song
than
welcome
robin
welcome
robin
song
is
one
of
good
cheer
but
this
one
is
of
pure
happiness
i
would
have
a
pair
of
ears
like
yours
for
anything
in
the
world
peter
peter
laughed
right
out
as
he
tried
to
picture
to
himself
jenny
wren
with
a
pair
of
long
ears
like
his
what
are
you
laughing
at
demanded
jenny
crossly
do
you
dare
laugh
at
me
if
there
is
any
one
thing
i
ca
stand
it
is
being
laughed
i
was
laughing
at
you
replied
peter
very
meekly
i
was
just
laughing
at
the
thought
of
how
funny
you
would
look
with
a
pair
of
long
ears
like
mine
now
you
speak
of
it
jenny
that
song
is
quite
different
from
welcome
of
course
it
is
retorted
jenny
that
is
rosebreast
singing
up
there
and
there
he
is
right
in
the
top
of
that
tree
is
he
handsome
peter
looked
up
to
see
a
bird
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
his
head
throat
and
back
were
black
his
wings
were
black
with
patches
of
white
on
them
but
it
was
his
breast
that
made
peter
catch
his
breath
with
a
little
gasp
of
admiration
for
that
breast
was
a
beautiful
the
rest
of
him
underneath
was
white
it
was
rosebreast
the
grosbeak
is
he
lovely
cried
peter
and
added
in
the
next
breath
who
is
that
with
him
mrs
grosbeak
of
course
who
else
would
it
be
sputtered
jenny
rather
crossly
for
she
was
still
a
little
put
out
because
she
had
been
laughed
at
i
would
never
have
guessed
it
said
peter
she
does
look
the
least
bit
like
this
was
quite
true
there
was
no
beautiful
rose
color
about
grosbeak
she
was
dressed
chiefly
in
brown
and
grayish
colors
with
a
little
buff
here
and
there
and
with
dark
streaks
on
her
breast
over
each
eye
was
a
whitish
line
altogether
she
looked
more
as
if
she
might
be
a
big
member
of
the
sparrow
family
than
the
wife
of
handsome
rosebreast
while
rosebreast
sang
grosbeak
was
very
busily
picking
buds
and
blossoms
from
the
tree
what
is
she
doing
that
for
inquired
peter
for
the
same
reason
that
you
bite
off
sweet
clover
blossoms
and
leaves
replied
jenny
wren
tartly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
live
on
buds
and
blossoms
cried
peter
i
never
heard
of
such
a
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
you
can
ask
more
silly
questions
than
anybody
of
my
acquaintance
retorted
jenny
wren
of
course
they
do
live
on
buds
and
blossoms
if
they
did
they
would
soon
starve
to
death
for
buds
and
blossoms
do
last
long
they
eat
a
few
just
for
variety
but
they
live
mostly
on
bugs
and
insects
you
ask
farmer
brown
boy
who
helps
him
most
in
his
potato
patch
and
he
tell
you
it
the
grosbeaks
they
certainly
do
love
potato
bugs
they
eat
some
fruit
but
on
the
whole
they
are
about
as
useful
around
a
garden
as
any
one
i
know
now
run
along
peter
rabbit
and
do
bother
me
any
seeing
farmer
brown
boy
coming
through
the
old
orchard
peter
decided
that
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
depart
so
he
scampered
for
the
green
forest
just
within
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
he
caught
sight
of
something
which
for
the
time
being
put
all
thought
of
farmer
brown
boy
out
of
his
head
fluttering
on
the
ground
was
a
bird
than
whom
not
even
glory
the
cardinal
was
more
beautiful
it
was
about
the
size
of
redwing
the
blackbird
wings
and
tail
were
pure
black
and
all
the
rest
was
a
beautiful
scarlet
it
was
redcoat
the
tanager
at
first
peter
had
eyes
only
for
the
wonderful
beauty
of
redcoat
never
before
had
he
seen
redcoat
so
close
at
hand
then
quite
suddenly
it
came
over
peter
that
something
was
wrong
with
redcoat
and
he
hurried
forward
to
see
what
the
trouble
might
be
redcoat
heard
the
rustle
of
peter
feet
among
the
dry
leaves
and
at
once
began
to
flap
and
flutter
in
an
effort
to
fly
away
but
he
could
not
get
off
the
ground
what
is
it
redcoat
has
something
happened
to
you
it
is
just
peter
rabbit
you
do
have
anything
to
fear
from
me
cried
peter
the
look
of
terror
which
had
been
in
the
eyes
of
redcoat
died
out
and
he
stopped
fluttering
and
simply
lay
panting
oh
peter
he
gasped
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
that
it
is
only
you
i
had
a
terrible
accident
and
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
ca
fly
and
if
i
have
to
stay
on
the
ground
some
enemy
will
be
sure
to
get
me
what
shall
i
do
peter
what
shall
i
do
right
away
peter
was
full
of
sympathy
what
kind
of
an
accident
was
it
redcoat
and
how
did
it
happen
he
asked
broadwing
the
hawk
tried
to
catch
me
sobbed
redcoat
in
dodging
him
among
the
trees
i
was
heedless
for
a
moment
and
did
not
see
just
where
i
was
going
i
struck
a
dead
twig
and
drove
it
right
through
my
right
redcoat
held
up
his
right
wing
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
little
stick
projecting
from
both
sides
close
up
to
the
shoulder
the
wing
was
bleeding
a
little
oh
dear
whatever
shall
i
do
peter
rabbit
whatever
shall
i
do
sobbed
redcoat
does
it
pain
you
dreadfully
asked
peter
redcoat
nodded
but
i
do
mind
the
pain
he
hastened
to
say
it
is
the
thought
of
what
may
happen
to
meanwhile
tanager
was
flying
about
in
the
tree
tops
near
at
hand
and
calling
anxiously
she
was
dressed
almost
wholly
in
light
and
she
looked
no
more
like
beautiful
redcoat
than
did
grosbeak
like
rosebreast
ca
you
fly
up
just
a
little
way
so
as
to
get
off
the
ground
she
cried
anxiously
is
it
dreadful
peter
rabbit
to
have
such
an
accident
we
just
got
our
nest
half
built
and
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
anything
happens
to
redcoat
oh
dear
here
comes
somebody
hide
redcoat
hide
tanager
flew
off
a
short
distance
to
one
side
and
began
to
cry
as
if
in
the
greatest
distress
peter
knew
instantly
that
she
was
crying
to
get
the
attention
of
whoever
was
coming
poor
redcoat
with
the
old
look
of
terror
in
his
eyes
fluttered
along
trying
to
find
something
under
which
to
hide
but
there
was
nothing
under
which
he
could
crawl
and
there
was
no
hiding
that
wonderful
red
coat
peter
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
and
looking
back
saw
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
coming
do
be
afraid
redcoat
he
whispered
it
farmer
brown
boy
and
i
sure
he
wo
hurt
you
perhaps
he
can
help
then
peter
scampered
off
for
a
short
distance
and
sat
up
to
watch
what
would
happen
of
coarse
farmer
brown
boy
saw
redcoat
no
one
with
any
eyes
at
all
could
have
helped
seeing
him
because
of
that
wonderful
scarlet
coat
he
saw
too
by
the
way
redcoat
was
acting
that
he
was
in
great
trouble
as
farmer
brown
boy
drew
near
and
redcoat
saw
that
he
was
discovered
he
tried
his
hardest
to
flutter
away
farmer
brown
boy
understood
instantly
that
something
was
wrong
with
one
wing
and
running
forward
he
caught
redcoat
you
poor
little
thing
you
poor
beautiful
little
creature
said
farmer
brown
boy
softly
as
he
saw
the
cruel
twig
sticking
through
redcoats
shoulder
we
have
to
get
that
out
right
away
continued
farmer
brown
boy
stroking
redcoat
ever
so
gently
somehow
at
that
gentle
touch
redcoat
lost
much
of
his
fear
and
a
little
hope
sprang
in
his
heart
he
saw
too
this
was
no
enemy
but
a
friend
farmer
brown
boy
took
out
his
knife
and
carefully
cut
off
the
twig
on
the
upper
side
of
the
wing
then
doing
his
best
to
be
careful
and
to
hurt
as
little
as
possible
he
worked
the
other
part
of
the
twig
out
from
the
under
side
carefully
he
examined
the
wing
to
see
if
any
bones
were
broken
none
were
and
after
holding
redcoat
a
few
minutes
he
carefully
set
him
up
in
a
tree
and
withdrew
a
short
distance
redcoat
hopped
from
branch
to
branch
until
he
was
halfway
up
the
tree
then
he
sat
there
for
some
time
as
if
fearful
of
trying
that
injured
wing
meanwhile
tanager
came
and
fussed
about
him
and
talked
to
him
and
coaxed
him
and
made
as
much
of
him
as
if
he
were
a
baby
peter
remained
right
where
he
was
until
at
last
he
saw
redcoat
spread
his
black
wings
and
fly
to
another
tree
from
tree
to
tree
he
flew
resting
a
bit
in
each
until
he
and
tanager
disappeared
in
the
green
forest
i
knew
farmer
brown
boy
would
help
him
and
i
so
glad
he
found
him
cried
peter
happily
and
started
for
the
dear
old
chapter
xxix
the
constant
singers

vireos
peter
rabbit
knew
that
they
had
a
nest
there
because
jenny
wren
had
told
him
so
he
would
have
guessed
it
anyway
because
redeye
spent
so
much
time
in
that
tree
during
the
nesting
season
no
matter
what
hour
of
the
day
peter
visited
the
old
orchard
he
heard
redeye
singing
over
in
the
peter
used
to
think
that
if
song
is
an
expression
of
happiness
redeye
must
be
the
happiest
of
all
birds
he
was
a
little
fellow
about
the
size
of
one
of
the
larger
warblers
and
quite
as
modestly
dressed
as
any
of
peter
acquaintances
the
crown
of
his
head
was
gray
with
a
little
blackish
border
on
either
side
over
each
eye
was
a
white
line
underneath
he
was
white
for
the
rest
he
was
dressed
in
light
the
first
time
he
came
down
near
enough
for
peter
to
see
him
well
peter
understood
at
once
why
he
is
called
redeye
his
eyes
were
red
yes
sir
his
eyes
were
red
and
this
fact
alone
was
enough
to
distinguish
him
from
any
other
members
of
his
family
but
it
was
often
that
redeye
came
down
so
near
the
ground
that
peter
could
see
his
eyes
he
preferred
to
spend
most
of
his
time
in
the
tree
tops
and
peter
only
got
glimpses
of
him
now
and
then
but
if
he
see
him
often
it
was
less
often
that
he
failed
to
hear
him
i
see
when
redeye
finds
time
to
eat
declared
peter
as
he
listened
to
the
seemingly
unending
song
in
the
redeye
believes
in
singing
while
he
works
said
jenny
wren
for
my
part
i
should
think
he
wear
his
throat
out
when
other
birds
sing
they
do
do
anything
else
but
redeye
sings
all
the
time
he
is
hunting
his
meals
and
only
stops
long
enough
to
swallow
a
worm
or
a
bug
when
he
finds
it
just
as
soon
as
it
is
down
he
begins
to
sing
again
while
he
hunts
for
another
i
must
say
for
the
redeyes
that
they
are
mighty
good
nest
builders
have
you
seen
their
nest
over
in
that
peter
peter
shook
his
head
i
do
dare
go
over
there
except
very
early
in
the
morning
before
farmer
brown
folks
are
awake
said
he
so
i
have
had
much
chance
to
look
for
you
probably
could
see
it
anyway
declared
jenny
wren
they
have
placed
it
rather
high
up
from
the
ground
and
those
leaves
are
so
thick
that
they
hide
it
it
a
regular
little
basket
fastened
in
a
fork
near
the
end
of
a
branch
and
it
is
woven
almost
as
nicely
as
is
the
nest
of
goldy
the
oriole
how
anybody
has
the
patience
to
weave
a
nest
like
that
is
beyond
what
it
made
of
asked
peter
strips
of
bark
plant
down
spider
web
grass
and
pieces
of
paper
replied
jenny
that
a
funny
thing
about
redeye
he
dearly
loves
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
nest
what
for
i
ca
imagine
he
as
fussy
about
having
a
scrap
of
paper
as
cresty
the
flycatcher
is
about
having
a
piece
of
snakeskin
i
had
just
a
peep
into
that
nest
a
few
days
ago
and
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
sally
sly
the
cowbird
has
managed
to
impose
on
the
redeyes
i
am
certain
i
saw
one
of
her
eggs
in
that
a
few
mornings
after
this
talk
with
jenny
wren
about
redeye
the
vireo
peter
once
more
visited
the
old
orchard
no
sooner
did
he
come
in
sight
than
jenny
wren
tongue
began
to
fly
what
did
i
tell
you
peter
rabbit
what
did
i
tell
you
i
knew
it
was
so
and
it
is
cried
jenny
what
is
so
asked
peter
rather
testily
for
he
had
the
least
idea
what
jenny
wren
was
talking
about
sally
sly
did
lay
an
egg
in
redeye
nest
and
now
it
has
hatched
and
i
do
know
whatever
is
to
become
of
redeye
own
children
perfectly
scandalous
that
what
it
is
perfectly
scandalous
cried
jenny
and
hopped
about
and
jerked
her
tail
and
worked
herself
into
a
small
brown
fury
the
redeyes
are
working
themselves
to
feathers
and
bone
feeding
that
ugly
young
cowbird
while
their
own
babies
are
getting
half
enough
to
eat
continued
jenny
one
of
them
has
died
already
he
was
kicked
out
of
the
nest
by
that
young
how
dreadful
cried
peter
if
he
does
things
like
that
i
should
think
the
redeyes
would
throw
him
out
of
the
they
too
declared
jenny
i
can
tell
you
i
be
so
if
i
were
in
their
place
no
i
would
but
they
say
it
is
his
fault
that
he
there
and
that
he
nothing
but
a
helpless
baby
and
so
they
just
take
care
of
then
why
do
they
feed
their
own
babies
first
and
give
him
left
demanded
peter
because
he
twice
as
big
as
any
of
their
own
babies
and
so
strong
and
greedy
that
he
simply
snatches
the
food
out
of
the
very
mouths
of
the
others
because
he
gets
most
of
the
food
he
growing
twice
as
fast
as
they
are
i
would
be
surprised
if
he
kicks
all
the
rest
of
them
out
before
he
gets
through
and
redeye
are
dreadfully
distressed
about
it
but
they
will
feed
him
because
they
say
it
is
his
fault
it
a
dreadful
affair
and
the
talk
of
the
whole
orchard
i
suppose
his
mother
is
off
gadding
somewhere
having
a
good
time
and
not
caring
a
flip
of
her
tail
feathers
what
becomes
of
him
i
believe
in
being
goodhearted
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
overdoing
the
matter
thank
goodness
i
not
so
that
i
can
be
imposed
on
in
any
such
way
as
speaking
of
the
vireos
redeye
seems
to
be
the
only
member
of
his
family
around
here
remarked
peter
listen
commanded
jenny
wren
do
you
hear
that
warbling
song
over
in
the
big
elm
in
front
of
farmer
brown
house
where
goldy
the
oriole
has
his
nest
peter
listened
at
first
he
did
hear
it
and
as
usual
jenny
wren
made
fun
of
him
for
having
such
big
ears
and
not
being
able
to
make
better
use
of
them
presently
he
did
hear
it
the
voice
was
not
unlike
that
of
redeye
but
the
song
was
smoother
more
continuous
and
sweeter
face
lighted
up
i
hear
it
he
cried
that
redeye
cousin
the
warbling
vireo
said
jenny
he
a
better
singer
than
redeye
and
just
as
fond
of
hearing
his
own
voice
he
sings
from
the
time
jolly
sun
gets
up
in
the
morning
until
he
goes
to
bed
at
night
he
sings
when
it
is
so
hot
that
the
rest
of
us
are
glad
to
keep
still
for
comfort
sake
i
do
know
of
anybody
more
fond
of
the
tree
tops
than
he
is
he
does
seem
to
care
anything
about
the
old
orchard
but
stays
over
in
those
big
trees
along
the
road
he
got
a
nest
over
in
that
big
elm
and
it
is
as
high
up
as
that
of
goldy
the
oriole
i
have
seen
it
myself
but
goldy
told
me
about
it
why
any
one
so
small
should
want
to
live
so
high
up
in
the
world
i
do
know
any
more
than
i
know
why
any
one
wants
to
live
anywhere
but
in
the
old
somehow
i
do
remember
just
what
warble
looks
like
peter
confessed
he
looks
a
lot
like
his
cousin
redeye
replied
jenny
his
coat
is
a
little
duller
and
underneath
he
is
a
little
bit
yellowish
instead
of
being
white
of
course
he
does
have
red
eyes
and
he
is
a
little
smaller
than
redeye
the
whole
family
looks
pretty
much
alike
you
said
something
then
jenny
wren
declared
peter
they
get
me
all
mixed
up
if
only
some
of
them
had
some
bright
colors
it
would
be
easier
to
tell
them
one
has
replied
jenny
wren
he
has
a
bright
yellow
throat
and
breast
and
is
called
the
vireo
there
is
the
least
chance
of
mistaking
is
he
a
singer
too
asked
peter
of
course
replied
jenny
every
one
of
that
blessed
family
loves
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
it
a
family
trait
sometimes
it
just
makes
my
throat
sore
to
listen
to
them
all
day
long
a
good
thing
is
good
but
more
than
enough
of
a
good
thing
is
too
much
that
applies
to
gossiping
just
as
well
as
to
singing
and
i
wasted
more
time
on
you
than
any
business
to
now
hop
along
peter
and
do
bother
me
any
more
peter
hopped

jenny
wren
cousins
peter
rabbit
never
will
forget
his
surprise
when
jenny
wren
asked
him
one
spring
morning
if
he
had
seen
anything
of
her
big
cousin
peter
hesitated
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
could
think
of
any
big
cousin
of
jenny
wren
all
the
cousins
he
knew
anything
about
were
very
nearly
jenny
own
size
now
jenny
wren
is
one
of
the
most
impatient
small
persons
in
the
world
well
well
well
peter
have
you
lost
your
tongue
she
chattered
ca
you
answer
a
simple
question
without
talking
all
day
about
it
have
you
seen
anything
of
my
big
cousin
it
is
high
time
for
him
to
be
you
need
be
so
cross
about
it
if
i
am
slow
replied
peter
just
trying
to
think
who
your
big
cousin
is
i
guess
to
be
quite
honest
i
do
know
do
know
him
do
know
him
sputtered
jenny
of
course
you
know
him
you
ca
help
but
know
him
i
mean
brownie
the
in
his
surprise
peter
fairly
jumped
right
off
the
ground
what
that
he
exclaimed
since
when
was
brownie
the
thrasher
related
to
the
wren
family
ever
since
there
have
been
any
wrens
and
thrashers
retorted
jenny
brownie
belongs
to
one
branch
of
the
family
and
i
belong
to
another
and
that
makes
him
my
second
cousin
it
certainly
is
surprising
how
little
some
folks
but
i
have
always
supposed
he
belonged
to
the
thrush
family
protested
peter
he
certainly
looks
like
a
looking
like
one
does
make
him
one
snapped
jenny
by
this
time
you
ought
to
leave
learned
that
you
never
can
judge
anybody
just
by
looks
it
always
makes
me
provoked
to
hear
brownie
called
the
brown
thrush
there
is
a
drop
of
thrush
blood
in
him
but
you
answered
my
question
yet
peter
rabbit
i
want
to
know
if
he
has
got
here
yes
said
peter
i
saw
him
only
yesterday
on
the
edge
of
the
old
pasture
he
was
fussing
around
in
the
bushes
and
on
the
ground
and
jerking
that
long
tail
of
his
up
and
down
and
sidewise
as
if
he
decide
what
to
do
with
it
i
never
seen
anybody
twitch
their
tail
around
the
way
he
jenny
wren
giggled
that
just
like
him
said
she
it
is
because
he
thrashes
his
tail
around
so
much
that
he
is
called
a
thrasher
i
suppose
he
was
wearing
his
new
spring
i
do
know
whether
it
was
a
new
suit
or
not
but
it
was
mighty
good
looking
replied
peter
i
just
love
that
beautiful
of
his
back
wings
and
tail
and
it
certainly
does
set
off
his
white
and
buff
waistcoat
with
those
dark
streaks
and
spots
you
must
admit
jenny
wren
that
any
one
seeing
him
dressed
so
much
like
the
thrushes
is
to
be
excused
for
thinking
him
a
i
suppose
so
admitted
jenny
rather
grudgingly
but
none
of
the
thrushes
have
such
a
bright
brown
coat
brownie
is
handsome
if
i
do
say
so
did
you
notice
what
a
long
bill
he
has
peter
nodded
and
i
noticed
that
he
had
two
white
bars
on
each
wing
said
he
i
glad
you
so
observing
replied
jenny
dryly
did
you
hear
him
sing
did
i
hear
him
sing
cried
peter
his
eyes
shining
at
the
memory
he
sang
especially
for
me
he
flew
up
to
the
top
of
a
tree
tipped
his
head
back
and
sang
as
few
birds
i
know
of
can
sing
he
has
a
wonderful
voice
has
brownie
i
do
know
of
anybody
i
enjoy
listening
to
more
and
when
he
singing
he
acts
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
himself
and
knows
what
a
good
singer
he
is
i
noticed
that
long
tail
of
his
hung
straight
down
the
same
way
wren
does
when
he
of
course
it
did
replied
jenny
promptly
that
a
family
trait
the
tails
of
both
my
other
big
cousins
do
the
same
that
have
you
got
more
big
cousins
cried
peter
staring
up
at
jenny
as
if
she
were
some
strange
person
he
never
had
seen
before
certainly
retorted
jenny
mocker
the
mockingbird
and
kitty
the
catbird
belong
to
brownie
family
and
that
makes
them
second
cousins
to
such
a
funny
expression
as
there
was
on
peter
face
he
felt
that
jenny
wren
was
telling
the
truth
but
it
was
surprising
news
to
him
and
so
hard
to
believe
that
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
find
his
tongue
to
ask
another
question
finally
he
ventured
to
ask
very
timidly
does
brownie
imitate
the
songs
of
other
birds
the
way
mocker
and
kitty
do
jenny
wren
shook
her
head
very
decidedly
no
said
she
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
own
before
she
could
add
anything
further
the
clear
whistle
of
glory
the
cardinal
sounded
from
a
tree
just
a
little
way
off
instantly
peter
forgot
all
about
jenny
relatives
and
scampered
over
to
that
tree
you
see
glory
is
so
beautiful
that
peter
never
loses
a
chance
to
see
him
as
peter
sat
staring
up
into
the
tree
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
glory
beautiful
red
coat
the
clear
sweet
whistle
sounded
once
more
it
drew
peter
eyes
to
one
of
the
upper
branches
but
instead
of
the
beautiful
brilliant
coat
of
glory
the
cardinal
he
saw
a
bird
about
the
size
of
welcome
robin
dressed
in
sober
with
two
white
bars
on
his
wings
and
white
feathers
on
the
outer
edges
of
his
tail
he
was
very
trim
and
neat
and
his
tail
hung
straight
down
after
the
manner
of
brownie
when
he
was
singing
it
was
a
long
tail
but
not
as
long
as
brownie
even
as
peter
blinked
and
stared
in
surprise
the
stranger
opened
his
mouth
and
from
it
came
glory
own
beautiful
whistle
then
the
stranger
looked
down
at
peter
and
his
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
fooled
you
that
time
did
i
peter
he
chuckled
you
thought
you
were
going
to
see
glory
the
cardinal
did
you
then
without
waiting
for
peter
to
reply
this
stranger
gave
such
a
concert
as
no
one
else
in
the
world
could
give
from
that
wonderful
throat
poured
out
song
after
song
and
note
after
note
of
peter
familiar
friends
of
the
old
orchard
and
the
performance
wound
up
with
a
lovely
song
which
was
all
the
stranger
own
peter
have
to
be
told
who
the
stranger
was
it
was
mocker
the
mockingbird
oh
gasped
peter
oh
mocker
how
under
the
sun
do
you
do
it
i
was
sure
that
it
was
glory
whom
i
heard
whistling
never
again
will
i
be
able
to
believe
my
own
mocker
chuckled
you
not
the
only
one
i
fooled
peter
said
he
i
flatter
myself
that
i
can
fool
almost
anybody
if
i
set
out
to
lots
of
fun
i
may
not
be
much
to
look
at
but
when
it
comes
to
singing
there
no
one
i
envy
i
think
you
are
very
nice
looking
indeed
replied
peter
politely
i
just
been
finding
out
this
morning
that
you
ca
tell
much
about
folks
just
by
their
and
now
you
learned
that
you
ca
always
recognize
folks
by
their
voices
have
you
chuckled
mocker
yes
replied
peter
hereafter
i
shall
never
be
sure
about
any
feathered
folks
unless
i
can
both
see
and
hear
them
wo
you
sing
for
me
again
mocker
mocker
did
he
sang
and
sang
for
he
clearly
loves
to
sing
when
he
finished
peter
had
another
question
ready
somebody
told
me
once
that
down
in
the
south
you
are
the
best
loved
of
all
the
birds
is
that
so
that
not
for
me
to
say
replied
mocker
modestly
but
i
can
tell
you
this
peter
they
do
think
a
lot
of
me
down
there
there
are
many
birds
down
there
who
are
very
beautifully
dressed
birds
who
do
come
up
here
at
all
but
not
one
of
them
is
loved
as
i
am
and
it
is
all
on
account
of
my
voice
i
would
rather
have
a
beautiful
voice
than
a
fine
peter
nodded
as
if
he
quite
agreed
which
when
you
think
of
it
is
rather
funny
for
peter
has
neither
a
fine
coat
nor
a
fine
voice
a
glint
of
mischief
sparkled
in
mocker
eyes
there
goldy
the
oriole
over
there
said
he
watch
me
fool
he
began
to
call
in
exact
imitation
of
goldy
voice
when
he
is
anxious
about
something
at
once
goldy
came
hurrying
over
to
find
out
what
the
trouble
was
when
she
discovered
mocker
she
lost
her
temper
and
scolded
him
roundly
then
she
flew
away
a
perfect
picture
of
indignation
mocker
and
peter
laughed
for
they
thought
it
a
good
joke
suddenly
peter
remembered
what
jenny
wren
had
told
him
was
jenny
wren
telling
you
the
truth
when
she
said
that
you
are
a
second
cousin
of
hers
he
asked
mocker
nodded
yes
said
he
we
are
relatives
we
each
belong
to
a
branch
of
the
same
then
he
burst
into
wren
own
song
after
which
he
excused
himself
and
went
to
look
for
mocker
for
as
he
explained
it
was
time
for
them
to
be
thinking
of
a
nest
chapter
xxxi
voices
of
the
dusk
jolly
round
red
sun
was
just
going
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
had
begun
to
creep
all
through
the
green
forest
and
out
across
the
green
meadows
it
was
the
hour
of
the
day
peter
rabbit
loves
best
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
watching
for
the
first
little
star
to
twinkle
high
up
in
the
sky
peter
felt
at
peace
with
all
the
great
world
for
it
was
the
hour
of
peace
the
hour
of
rest
for
those
who
had
been
busy
all
through
the
shining
day
most
of
peter
feathered
friends
had
settled
themselves
for
the
coming
night
the
worries
and
cares
of
the
day
over
and
forgotten
all
the
great
world
seemed
hushed
in
the
distance
sweetvoice
the
vesper
sparrow
was
pouring
out
his
evening
song
for
it
was
the
hour
when
he
dearly
loves
to
sing
far
back
in
the
green
forest
was
calling
as
if
his
very
life
depended
on
the
number
of
times
he
could
say
whip
poor
will
without
taking
a
breath
from
overhead
came
now
and
then
the
sharp
rather
harsh
cry
of
boomer
the
nighthawk
as
he
hunted
his
supper
in
the
air
for
a
time
it
seemed
as
if
these
were
the
only
feathered
friends
still
awake
and
peter
could
help
thinking
that
those
who
went
so
early
to
bed
missed
the
most
beautiful
hour
of
the
whole
day
then
from
a
tree
just
back
of
him
there
poured
forth
a
song
so
clear
so
sweet
so
wonderfully
suited
to
that
peaceful
hour
that
peter
held
his
breath
until
it
was
finished
he
knew
that
singer
and
loved
him
it
was
melody
the
wood
thrush
when
the
song
ended
peter
hopped
over
to
the
tree
from
which
it
had
come
it
was
still
light
enough
for
him
to
see
the
sweet
singer
he
sat
on
a
branch
near
the
top
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
soft
full
throat
throbbing
with
the
notes
he
was
pouring
forth
he
was
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
his
coat
was
a
beautiful
not
quite
so
bright
as
that
of
brownie
the
thrasher
beneath
he
was
white
with
large
black
spots
thickly
dotting
his
breast
and
sides
he
was
singing
as
if
he
were
trying
to
put
into
those
beautiful
notes
all
the
joy
of
life
listening
to
it
peter
felt
steal
over
him
a
wonderful
feeling
of
peace
and
pure
happiness
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
interrupted
it
the
black
shadows
crept
far
across
the
green
meadows
and
it
became
so
dusky
in
the
green
forest
that
peter
could
barely
make
out
the
sweet
singer
above
his
head
still
melody
sang
on
and
the
hush
of
eventide
grew
deeper
as
if
all
the
great
world
were
holding
its
breath
to
listen
it
was
not
until
several
little
stars
had
begun
to
twinkle
high
up
in
the
sky
that
melody
stopped
singing
and
sought
the
safety
of
his
hidden
perch
for
the
night
peter
felt
sure
that
somewhere
near
was
a
nest
and
that
one
thing
which
had
made
that
song
so
beautiful
was
the
love
melody
lad
been
trying
to
express
to
the
little
mate
sitting
on
the
eggs
that
nest
must
contain
i
just
run
over
here
early
in
the
morning
thought
peter
now
peter
is
a
great
hand
to
stay
out
all
night
and
that
is
just
what
he
did
that
night
just
before
it
was
time
for
jolly
round
red
sun
to
kick
off
his
rosy
blankets
and
begin
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
peter
started
for
home
in
the
dear
old
everywhere
in
the
green
forest
in
the
old
orchard
on
the
green
meadows
his
feathered
friends
were
awakening
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
intention
to
visit
melody
and
was
reminded
of
it
only
when
again
he
heard
those
beautiful
notes
at
once
he
scampered
over
to
where
he
had
spent
such
a
peaceful
hour
the
evening
before
melody
saw
him
at
once
and
dropped
down
on
the
ground
for
a
little
gossip
while
he
scratched
among
the
leaves
in
search
of
his
breakfast
i
just
love
to
hear
you
sing
melody
cried
peter
rather
breathlessly
i
do
know
of
any
other
song
that
makes
me
feel
quite
as
yours
does
so
sort
of
perfectly
contented
and
free
of
care
and
thank
you
replied
melody
i
glad
you
like
to
hear
me
sing
for
there
is
nothing
i
like
to
do
better
it
is
the
one
way
in
which
i
can
express
my
feelings
i
love
all
the
great
world
and
i
just
have
to
tell
it
so
i
do
not
mean
to
boast
when
i
say
that
all
the
thrush
family
have
good
but
you
have
the
best
of
all
cried
peter
melody
shook
his
brown
head
i
would
say
that
said
he
modestly
i
think
the
song
of
my
cousin
hermit
is
even
more
beautiful
than
mine
and
then
there
is
my
other
cousin
veery
his
song
is
wonderful
i
but
just
then
peter
curiosity
was
greater
than
his
interest
in
songs
have
you
built
your
nest
yet
he
asked
melody
nodded
it
is
in
a
little
tree
not
far
from
here
said
he
and
wood
thrush
is
sitting
on
five
eggs
this
blessed
minute
is
that
perfectly
lovely
it
was
peter
turn
to
nod
what
is
your
nest
built
of
he
inquired
rootlets
and
tiny
twigs
and
weed
stalks
and
leaves
and
mud
replied
melody
mud
exclaimed
peter
why
that
what
welcome
robin
uses
in
his
well
welcome
robin
is
my
own
cousin
so
i
do
know
as
anything
so
surprising
in
that
retorted
melody
oh
said
peter
i
had
forgotten
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
thrush
well
he
is
even
if
he
is
dressed
quite
differently
from
the
rest
of
us
replied
melody
you
mentioned
your
cousin
hermit
i
do
believe
i
know
him
said
peter
then
it
high
time
you
got
acquainted
with
him
replied
melody
promptly
he
is
rather
fond
of
being
by
himself
and
that
is
why
he
is
called
the
hermit
thrush
he
is
smaller
than
i
and
his
coat
is
not
such
a
bright
brown
his
tail
is
brighter
than
his
coat
he
has
a
waistcoat
spotted
very
much
like
mine
some
folks
consider
him
the
most
beautiful
singer
of
the
thrush
family
i
glad
you
like
my
song
but
you
must
hear
hermit
sing
i
really
think
there
is
no
song
so
beautiful
in
all
the
green
does
he
build
a
nest
like
yours
asked
peter
no
replied
melody
he
builds
his
nest
on
the
ground
and
he
use
any
mud
now
if
you
excuse
me
peter
i
must
get
my
breakfast
and
give
wood
thrush
a
chance
to
get
so
peter
continued
on
his
way
to
the
dear
old
and
there
he
spent
the
day
as
evening
approached
he
decided
to
go
back
to
hear
melody
sing
again
just
as
he
drew
near
the
green
forest
he
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
laughing
brook
a
song
that
caused
him
to
change
his
mind
and
sent
him
hurrying
in
that
direction
it
was
a
very
different
song
from
that
of
melody
the
wood
thrush
yet
if
he
had
never
heard
it
before
peter
would
have
known
that
such
a
song
could
come
from
no
throat
except
that
of
a
member
of
the
thrush
family
as
he
drew
near
the
laughing
brook
the
beautiful
notes
seemed
to
ring
through
the
green
forest
like
a
bell
as
melody
song
had
filled
peter
with
a
feeling
of
peace
so
this
song
stirred
in
him
a
feeling
of
the
wonderful
mystery
of
life
there
was
in
it
the
very
spirit
of
the
green
forest
it
did
take
peter
long
to
find
the
singer
it
was
veery
who
has
been
named
wilson
thrush
and
by
some
folks
is
known
as
the
tawny
thrush
at
the
sound
of
the
patter
of
peter
feet
the
song
stopped
abruptly
and
he
was
greeted
with
a
whistled
wheeu
wheeu
then
seeing
that
it
was
no
one
of
whom
he
need
be
afraid
veery
came
out
from
under
some
ferns
to
greet
peter
he
was
smaller
than
melody
the
wood
thrush
being
about
smaller
than
welcome
robin
he
wore
a
brown
coat
but
it
was
not
as
bright
as
that
of
his
cousin
melody
his
breast
was
somewhat
faintly
spotted
with
brown
and
below
he
was
white
his
sides
were
and
not
spotted
like
the
sides
of
melody
i
heard
you
singing
and
i
just
had
to
come
over
to
see
you
cried
peter
i
hope
you
like
my
song
said
veery
i
love
to
sing
just
at
this
hour
and
i
love
to
think
that
other
people
like
to
hear
they
do
declared
peter
most
emphatically
i
ca
imagine
how
anybody
could
fail
to
like
to
hear
you
i
came
over
here
just
to
sit
a
while
and
listen
wo
you
sing
some
more
for
me
veery
i
certainly
will
peter
replied
veery
i
would
feel
that
i
was
going
to
bed
right
if
i
did
sing
until
dark
there
is
no
part
of
the
day
i
love
better
than
the
evening
and
the
only
way
i
can
express
my
happiness
and
my
love
of
the
green
forest
and
the
joy
of
just
being
back
here
at
home
is
by
veery
slipped
out
of
sight
and
almost
at
once
his
notes
began
to
ring
through
the
green
forest
peter
sat
right
where
he
was
content
to
just
listen
and
feel
within
himself
the
joy
of
being
alive
and
happy
in
the
beautiful
spring
season
which
veery
was
expressing
so
wonderfully
the
black
shadows
grew
blacker
one
by
one
the
little
stars
came
out
and
twinkled
down
through
the
tree
tops
finally
from
deep
in
the
green
forest
sounded
the
hunting
call
of
hooty
the
owl
veery
song
stopped
good
night
peter
he
called
softly
good
night
veery
replied
peter
and
hopped
back
towards
the
green
meadows
for
a
feast
of
sweet
clover
chapter
xxxii
peter
saves
a
friend
and
learns
something
peter
rabbit
sat
in
a
thicket
of
young
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
it
was
warm
and
peter
was
feeling
lazy
he
had
nothing
in
particular
to
do
and
as
he
knew
of
no
cooler
place
he
had
squatted
there
to
doze
a
bit
and
dream
a
bit
so
far
as
he
knew
peter
was
all
alone
he
had
seen
anybody
when
he
entered
that
little
thicket
and
though
he
had
listened
he
had
heard
a
sound
to
indicate
that
he
did
have
that
thicket
quite
to
himself
it
was
very
quiet
there
and
though
when
he
first
entered
he
had
the
least
intention
in
the
world
of
going
to
sleep
it
was
long
before
he
was
dozing
now
peter
is
a
light
sleeper
as
all
little
people
who
never
know
when
they
may
have
to
run
for
their
lives
must
be
by
and
by
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
he
was
very
wide
awake
indeed
something
had
wakened
him
though
just
what
it
was
he
could
say
his
long
ears
stood
straight
up
as
he
listened
with
all
his
might
for
some
little
sound
which
might
mean
danger
his
wobbly
little
nose
wobbled
very
fast
indeed
as
it
tested
the
air
for
the
scent
of
a
possible
enemy
very
alert
was
peter
as
he
waited
for
a
few
minutes
he
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
then
near
the
outer
edge
of
the
thicket
he
heard
a
great
rustling
of
dry
leaves
it
must
have
been
this
that
had
wakened
him
for
just
an
instant
peter
was
startled
but
only
for
an
instant
his
long
ears
told
him
at
once
that
that
noise
was
made
by
some
one
scratching
among
the
leaves
and
he
knew
that
no
one
who
did
not
wear
feathers
could
scratch
like
that
now
who
can
that
be
thought
peter
and
stole
forward
very
softly
towards
the
place
from
which
the
sound
came
presently
as
he
peeped
between
the
stems
of
the
young
trees
he
saw
the
brown
leaves
which
carpeted
the
ground
fly
this
way
and
that
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
an
exceedingly
busy
person
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
scratching
away
for
dear
life
every
now
and
then
he
picked
up
something
his
head
throat
back
and
breast
were
black
beneath
he
was
white
his
sides
were
his
tail
was
black
and
white
and
the
longer
feathers
of
his
wings
were
edged
with
white
it
was
chewink
the
towhee
sometimes
called
ground
robin
peter
chuckled
but
it
was
a
noiseless
chuckle
he
kept
perfectly
still
for
it
was
fun
to
watch
some
one
who
had
the
least
idea
that
he
was
being
watched
it
was
quite
clear
that
chewink
was
hungry
and
that
under
those
dry
leaves
he
was
finding
a
good
meal
his
feet
were
made
for
scratching
and
he
certainly
knew
how
to
use
them
for
some
time
peter
sat
there
watching
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
make
his
presence
known
and
have
a
bit
of
morning
gossip
when
happening
to
look
out
beyond
the
edge
of
the
little
thicket
he
saw
something
red
it
was
something
alive
for
it
was
moving
very
slowly
and
cautiously
towards
the
place
where
chewink
was
so
busy
and
forgetful
of
everything
but
his
breakfast
peter
knew
that
there
was
only
one
person
with
a
coat
of
that
color
it
was
reddy
fox
and
quite
plainly
reddy
was
hoping
to
catch
chewink
for
a
second
or
two
peter
was
quite
undecided
what
to
do
he
warn
chewink
without
making
his
own
presence
known
to
reddy
fox
of
course
he
could
sit
perfectly
still
and
let
chewink
be
caught
but
that
was
such
a
dreadful
thought
that
peter
did
consider
it
for
more
than
a
second
or
two
he
suddenly
thumped
the
ground
with
his
feet
it
was
his
danger
signal
which
all
his
friends
know
then
he
turned
and
scampered
to
a
thick
not
far
behind
him
at
the
sound
of
that
thump
chewink
instantly
flew
up
in
a
little
tree
then
he
saw
reddy
fox
and
began
to
scold
as
for
reddy
he
looked
over
towards
the
and
snarled
i
get
you
one
of
these
days
peter
rabbit
said
he
i
get
you
one
of
these
days
and
pay
you
up
for
cheating
me
out
of
a
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
chewink
reddy
turned
and
trotted
off
trying
his
best
to
look
dignified
and
as
if
he
had
never
entertained
such
a
thought
as
trying
to
catch
chewink
from
his
perch
chewink
watched
until
he
was
sure
that
reddy
fox
had
gone
away
for
good
then
he
called
softly
towhee
towhee
chewink
chewink
all
is
safe
now
peter
rabbit
come
out
and
talk
with
me
and
let
me
tell
you
how
grateful
to
you
i
am
for
saving
my
chewink
flew
down
to
the
ground
and
peter
crept
out
of
the
it
was
anything
declared
peter
i
saw
reddy
and
i
knew
you
did
so
of
course
i
gave
the
alarm
you
would
have
done
the
same
thing
for
me
do
you
know
chewink
i
wondered
a
great
deal
about
what
have
you
wondered
about
me
asked
chewink
i
wondered
what
family
you
belong
to
replied
peter
chewink
chuckled
i
belong
to
a
big
family
said
he
i
belong
to
the
biggest
family
among
the
birds
it
is
the
finch
and
sparrow
family
there
are
a
lot
of
us
and
a
good
many
of
us
do
look
much
alike
but
still
we
belong
to
the
same
family
i
suppose
you
know
that
rosebreast
the
grosbeak
and
glory
the
cardinal
are
members
of
my
i
did
know
it
replied
peter
but
if
you
say
it
is
so
i
suppose
it
must
be
so
it
is
easier
to
believe
than
it
is
to
believe
that
you
are
related
to
the
nevertheless
i
am
retorted
chewink
what
were
you
scratching
for
when
i
first
saw
you
asked
peter
oh
worms
and
bugs
that
hide
under
the
leaves
replied
chewink
carelessly
you
have
no
idea
how
many
of
them
hide
under
dead
do
you
eat
anything
else
asked
peter
berries
and
wild
fruits
in
season
replied
chewink
i
very
fond
of
them
they
make
a
variety
in
the
bill
of
i
noticed
that
i
seldom
see
you
up
in
the
tree
tops
remarked
peter
i
like
the
ground
better
replied
chewink
i
spend
more
of
my
time
on
the
ground
than
anywhere
i
suppose
that
means
that
you
nest
on
the
ground
ventured
peter
chewink
nodded
of
course
said
he
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
got
a
nest
in
this
very
thicket
towhee
is
on
it
right
now
and
i
suspect
she
worrying
and
anxious
to
know
what
happened
over
here
when
you
warned
me
about
reddy
fox
i
think
i
must
go
over
and
set
her
mind
at
peter
was
just
about
to
ask
if
he
might
go
along
and
see
that
nest
when
a
new
voice
broke
in
what
are
you
fellows
talking
about
it
demanded
and
there
flitted
just
in
front
of
peter
a
little
bird
the
size
of
a
sparrow
but
lovelier
than
any
sparrow
of
peter
acquaintance
at
first
glance
he
seemed
to
be
all
blue
and
such
a
lovely
bright
blue
but
as
he
paused
for
an
instant
peter
saw
that
his
wings
and
tail
were
mostly
black
and
that
the
lovely
blue
was
brightest
on
his
head
and
back
it
was
indigo
the
bunting
we
were
talking
about
our
family
replied
chewink
i
was
telling
peter
that
we
belong
to
the
largest
family
among
the
but
you
did
say
anything
about
indigo
interrupted
peter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
belongs
to
the
same
family
i
surely
do
replied
indigo
i
rather
closely
related
to
the
sparrow
branch
do
i
look
like
a
sparrow
peter
looked
at
indigo
closely
in
size
and
shape
you
do
he
confessed
but
just
the
same
i
should
never
in
the
world
have
thought
of
connecting
you
with
the
how
about
me
asked
another
voice
and
a
little
brown
bird
flew
up
beside
indigo
twitching
her
tail
nervously
she
looked
very
indeed
so
much
so
that
if
peter
had
not
seen
her
with
her
handsome
mate
for
she
was
indigo
he
certainly
would
have
taken
her
for
a
sparrow
only
on
her
wings
and
tail
was
there
any
of
the
blue
which
made
coat
so
beautiful
and
this
was
only
a
faint
tinge
i
have
to
confess
that
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
is
hard
to
think
of
you
as
related
to
the
sparrows
declared
peter
do
you
sometimes
wish
you
were
as
handsomely
dressed
as
indigo
indigo
shook
her
head
in
a
most
decided
way
never
she
declared
i
have
worries
enough
raising
a
family
as
it
is
but
if
i
had
a
coat
like
his
i
would
have
a
moment
of
peace
you
have
no
idea
how
i
worry
about
him
sometimes
you
ought
to
be
thankful
peter
rabbit
that
you
have
a
coat
like
his
it
attracts
altogether
too
much
peter
tried
to
picture
himself
in
a
bright
blue
coat
and
laughed
right
out
at
the
mere
thought
and
the
others
joined
with
him
then
indigo
flew
up
to
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
not
far
away
and
began
to
sing
it
was
a
lively
song
and
peter
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
indigo
took
this
opportunity
to
slip
away
unobserved
and
when
peter
looked
around
for
chewink
he
too
had
disappeared
he
had
gone
to
tell
chewink
that
he
was
quite
safe
and
that
she
had
nothing
to
worry
about
chapter
xxxiii
a
royal
dresser
and
a
late
nester
jenny
and
wren
were
busy
if
there
were
any
busier
little
folks
anywhere
peter
rabbit
could
imagine
who
they
could
be
you
see
everyone
of
those
seven
eggs
in
the
wren
nest
had
hatched
and
seven
mouths
are
a
lot
to
feed
especially
when
every
morsel
of
food
must
be
hunted
for
and
carried
from
a
distance
there
was
little
time
for
gossip
now
just
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
jenny
and
wren
began
feeding
those
always
hungry
babies
and
they
kept
at
it
with
hardly
time
for
an
occasional
mouthful
themselves
until
the
black
shadows
came
creeping
out
from
the
purple
hills
wren
babies
like
all
other
bird
babies
grow
very
fast
and
that
means
that
each
one
of
them
must
have
a
great
deal
of
food
every
day
each
one
of
them
often
ate
its
own
weight
in
food
in
a
day
and
all
their
food
had
to
be
hunted
for
and
when
found
carried
back
and
put
into
the
gaping
little
mouths
hardly
would
jenny
wren
disappear
in
the
little
round
doorway
of
her
home
with
a
caterpillar
in
her
bill
than
she
would
hop
out
again
and
wren
would
take
her
place
with
a
spider
or
a
fly
and
then
hurry
away
for
something
more
peter
tried
to
keep
count
of
the
number
of
times
they
came
and
went
but
soon
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
he
began
to
wonder
where
all
the
worms
and
bugs
and
spiders
came
from
and
gradually
he
came
to
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
eyes
sharp
enough
to
find
them
so
quickly
needless
to
say
jenny
was
than
ever
she
had
no
time
to
gossip
and
said
so
most
emphatically
so
at
last
peter
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
find
out
from
her
certain
things
he
wanted
to
know
and
hopped
off
to
look
for
some
one
who
was
less
busy
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
song
so
sweet
and
so
full
of
little
trills
that
he
first
stopped
to
listen
then
went
to
look
for
the
singer
it
did
take
long
to
find
him
for
he
was
sitting
on
the
very
tiptop
of
a
in
farmer
brown
yard
peter
did
dare
go
over
there
for
already
it
was
broad
daylight
and
he
had
about
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
have
to
content
himself
with
just
listening
to
that
sweet
singer
when
the
latter
flew
over
in
the
old
orchard
and
alighted
just
over
peter
head
hello
peter
he
cried
hello
linnet
cried
peter
i
was
wondering
who
it
could
be
who
was
singing
like
that
i
ought
to
have
known
but
you
see
it
so
long
since
i
heard
you
sing
that
i
could
just
remember
your
song
i
so
glad
you
came
over
here
for
i
just
dying
to
talk
to
linnet
the
purple
finch
for
this
is
who
it
was
laughed
right
out
i
see
you
still
the
same
old
peter
said
he
i
suppose
you
just
as
full
of
curiosity
as
ever
and
just
as
full
of
questions
well
here
i
am
so
what
shall
we
talk
about
you
replied
peter
bluntly
lately
i
found
out
so
many
surprising
things
about
my
feathered
friends
that
i
want
to
know
more
i
trying
to
get
it
straight
in
my
head
who
is
related
to
who
and
i
found
out
some
things
which
have
begun
to
make
me
feel
that
i
know
very
little
about
my
feathered
neighbors
it
getting
so
that
i
do
dare
to
even
guess
who
a
person
relatives
are
if
you
please
linnet
what
family
do
you
belong
to
linnet
flew
down
a
little
nearer
to
peter
look
me
over
peter
said
he
with
twinkling
eyes
look
me
over
and
see
if
you
ca
tell
for
peter
stared
solemnly
at
linnet
he
saw
a
bird
of
sparrow
size
most
of
whose
body
was
a
brightest
on
the
head
darkest
on
the
back
and
palest
on
the
breast
underneath
he
was
whitish
his
wings
and
tail
were
brownish
the
outer
parts
of
the
feathers
edged
with
his
bill
was
short
and
stout
before
peter
could
reply
linnet
appeared
there
was
so
much
as
a
touch
of
that
beautiful
about
her
her
back
was
streaked
with
black
and
her
white
breast
and
sides
were
spotted
and
streaked
with
brown
if
peter
had
seen
her
with
linnet
he
certainly
would
have
taken
her
for
a
sparrow
she
looked
so
much
like
one
that
he
ventured
to
say
i
guess
you
belong
to
the
sparrow
that
pretty
close
peter
that
pretty
close
declared
linnet
we
belong
to
the
finch
branch
of
the
family
which
makes
the
sparrows
own
cousins
to
us
folks
may
get
linnet
mixed
with
some
of
our
sparrow
cousins
but
they
never
can
mistake
me
there
is
anybody
else
my
size
with
a
coat
like
mine
if
you
ca
remember
my
song
which
you
ought
to
because
there
is
no
other
song
quite
like
it
you
can
always
tell
me
by
the
color
of
my
coat
hello
here
comes
cousin
chicoree
did
you
ever
see
a
happier
fellow
than
he
is
i
venture
to
say
that
he
has
been
having
such
a
good
time
that
he
has
even
yet
thought
of
building
a
nest
and
here
half
the
people
of
the
old
orchard
have
grown
families
i
a
nest
and
eggs
myself
but
that
madcap
is
just
roaming
about
having
a
good
time
is
that
so
chicoree
is
what
so
demanded
chicoree
the
goldfinch
perching
very
near
to
where
linnet
was
sitting
is
it
true
that
you
have
even
begun
thinking
about
a
nest
demanded
linnet
chicoree
flew
down
in
the
grass
almost
under
nose
and
began
to
pull
apart
a
dandelion
which
had
gone
to
seed
he
snipped
the
seeds
from
the
soft
down
to
which
they
were
attached
and
did
say
a
word
till
he
was
quite
through
then
he
flew
up
in
the
tree
near
linnet
and
while
he
dressed
his
feathers
answered
question
it
quite
true
but
what
of
it
said
he
there
time
enough
to
think
about
and
household
cares
later
goldfinch
and
i
will
begin
to
think
about
them
about
the
first
of
july
meanwhile
we
are
making
the
most
of
this
beautiful
season
to
roam
about
and
have
a
good
time
for
one
thing
we
like
thistledown
to
line
our
nest
and
there
is
any
thistledown
yet
then
there
is
no
sense
in
raising
a
family
until
there
is
plenty
of
the
right
kind
of
food
and
you
know
we
goldfinches
live
mostly
on
seeds
i
venture
to
say
that
we
are
the
greatest
anywhere
around
of
course
when
the
babies
are
small
they
have
to
have
soft
food
but
one
can
find
plenty
of
worms
and
bugs
any
time
during
the
summer
just
as
soon
as
the
children
are
big
enough
to
hunt
their
own
food
they
need
seeds
so
there
is
no
sense
in
trying
to
raise
a
family
until
there
are
plenty
of
seeds
for
them
when
needed
meanwhile
we
are
having
a
good
time
how
do
you
like
my
summer
suit
peter
it
beautiful
cried
peter
i
would
know
you
for
the
same
bird
i
see
so
often
in
the
late
fall
and
sometimes
in
the
winter
i
do
know
of
anybody
who
makes
a
more
complete
change
that
black
cap
certainly
is
very
smart
and
chicoree
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
the
better
to
show
off
that
black
cap
the
rest
of
his
head
and
his
whole
body
were
bright
yellow
his
wings
were
black
with
two
white
bars
on
each
his
tail
also
was
black
with
some
white
on
it
in
size
he
was
a
little
smaller
than
linnet
and
altogether
one
of
the
smartest
appearing
of
all
the
little
people
who
wear
feathers
it
was
a
joy
just
to
look
at
him
if
peter
had
known
anything
about
canaries
which
of
course
he
did
because
canaries
are
always
kept
in
cages
he
would
have
understood
why
chicoree
the
goldfinch
is
often
called
the
wild
canary
goldfinch
now
joined
her
handsome
mate
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
admired
him
quite
as
much
as
did
peter
her
wings
and
tail
were
much
like
his
but
were
more
brownish
than
black
she
wore
no
cap
it
all
and
her
back
and
head
were
a
with
an
olive
tinge
underneath
she
was
lighter
with
a
tinge
of
yellow
all
together
she
was
a
very
modestly
dressed
small
person
as
peter
recalled
chicoree
winter
suit
it
was
very
much
like
that
now
worn
by
goldfinch
save
that
his
wings
and
tail
were
as
they
now
appeared
all
the
time
chicoree
kept
up
a
continual
happy
twittering
breaking
out
every
few
moments
into
song
it
was
clear
that
he
was
fairly
bubbling
over
with
joy
i
suppose
said
peter
it
sounds
foolish
of
me
to
ask
if
you
are
a
member
of
the
same
family
as
very
foolish
peter
very
foolish
laughed
chicoree
is
my
name
goldfinch
and
is
his
name
purple
finch
we
belong
to
the
same
family
and
a
mighty
fine
family
it
is
now
i
must
go
over
to
the
old
pasture
to
see
how
the
thistles
are
coming
away
he
flew
calling
goldfinch
followed
as
they
flew
they
rose
and
fell
in
the
air
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
yellow
wing
the
flicker
does
i
know
them
just
by
that
even
if
chicoree
did
keep
calling
his
own
name
thought
peter
it
funny
how
they
often
stay
around
all
winter
yet
are
among
the
last
of
all
the
birds
to
set
up
housekeeping
as
i
once
said
to
jenny
wren
birds
certainly
are
funny
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
it
no
such
thing
peter
rabbit
it
no
such
thing
scolded
jenny
wren
as
she
flew
last
peter
on
her
way
to
hunt
for
another
worm
for
her
hungry
babies
chapter
xxxiv
mourner
the
dove
and
cuckoo
a
long
lane
leads
from
farmer
brown
barnyard
down
to
his
cornfield
on
the
green
meadows
it
happened
that
very
early
one
morning
peter
rabbit
took
it
into
his
funny
little
head
to
run
down
that
long
lane
to
see
what
he
might
see
now
at
a
certain
place
beside
that
long
lane
was
a
gravelly
bank
into
which
farmer
brown
had
dug
for
gravel
to
put
on
the
roadway
up
near
his
house
as
peter
was
scampering
past
this
place
where
farmer
brown
had
dug
he
caught
sight
of
some
one
very
busy
in
that
gravel
pit
peter
stopped
short
then
sat
up
to
stare
it
was
mourner
the
dove
whom
peter
saw
an
old
friend
of
whom
peter
is
very
fond
his
body
was
a
little
bigger
than
that
of
welcome
robin
but
his
long
slender
neck
and
longer
tail
and
wings
made
him
appear
considerably
larger
in
shape
he
reminded
peter
at
once
of
the
pigeons
up
at
farmer
brown
his
back
was
varying
to
the
crown
and
upper
parts
of
his
head
were
his
breast
was
shading
down
into
a
soft
buff
his
bill
was
black
and
his
feet
red
the
two
middle
feathers
of
his
tail
were
longest
and
of
the
color
of
his
back
the
other
feathers
were
with
little
black
bands
and
tipped
with
white
on
his
wings
were
a
few
scattered
black
spots
just
under
each
ear
was
a
black
spot
but
it
was
the
sides
of
his
slender
neck
which
were
the
most
beautiful
part
of
mourner
when
untouched
by
the
jolly
little
sunbeams
the
neck
feathers
appeared
to
be
in
color
very
like
his
breast
but
the
moment
they
were
touched
by
the
jolly
little
sunbeams
they
seemed
to
be
constantly
changing
which
as
you
know
is
called
iridescence
altogether
mourner
was
lovely
in
a
quiet
way
but
it
was
not
his
appearance
which
made
peter
stare
it
was
what
he
was
doing
he
was
walking
about
and
every
now
and
then
picking
up
something
quite
as
if
he
were
getting
his
breakfast
in
that
gravel
pit
and
peter
could
imagine
anything
good
to
eat
down
there
he
knew
that
there
were
not
even
worms
there
besides
mourner
is
not
fond
of
worms
he
lives
almost
altogether
on
seeds
and
grains
of
many
kinds
so
peter
was
puzzled
but
as
you
know
he
is
the
kind
to
puzzle
long
over
anything
when
he
can
use
his
tongue
hello
mourner
he
cried
what
under
the
sun
are
you
doing
in
there
are
you
getting
your
breakfast
hardly
peter
hardly
cooed
mourner
in
the
softest
of
voices
i
had
my
breakfast
and
now
i
picking
up
a
little
gravel
for
my
he
picked
up
a
tiny
pebble
and
swallowed
it
well
of
all
things
cried
peter
you
must
be
crazy
the
idea
of
thinking
that
gravel
is
going
to
help
your
digestion
i
should
say
the
chances
are
that
it
will
work
just
the
other
mourner
laughed
it
was
the
softest
of
little
cooing
laughs
very
pleasant
to
hear
i
see
that
as
usual
you
are
judging
others
by
yourself
said
he
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
you
can
do
nothing
more
foolish
i
have
the
least
doubt
that
a
breakfast
of
gravel
would
give
you
the
worst
kind
of
a
but
you
are
you
and
i
am
i
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
you
know
i
eat
grain
and
hard
seeds
not
having
any
teeth
i
have
to
swallow
them
whole
one
part
of
my
stomach
is
called
a
gizzard
and
its
duty
is
to
grind
and
crush
my
food
so
that
it
may
be
digested
tiny
pebbles
and
gravel
help
grind
the
food
and
so
aid
digestion
i
think
i
got
enough
now
for
this
morning
and
it
is
time
for
a
dust
bath
there
is
a
dusty
spot
over
in
the
lane
where
i
take
a
dust
bath
every
if
you
do
mind
said
peter
i
go
with
mourner
said
he
did
mind
so
peter
followed
him
over
to
the
dusty
place
in
the
long
lane
there
mourner
was
joined
by
dove
who
was
dressed
very
much
like
him
save
that
she
did
not
have
so
beautiful
a
neck
while
they
thoroughly
dusted
themselves
they
chatted
with
peter
i
see
you
on
the
ground
so
much
that
i
often
wondered
if
you
build
your
nest
on
the
ground
said
peter
no
replied
mourner
mrs
dove
builds
in
a
tree
but
usually
not
very
far
above
the
ground
now
if
you
excuse
us
we
must
get
back
home
dove
has
two
eggs
to
sit
on
and
while
she
is
siting
i
like
to
be
close
at
hand
to
keep
her
company
and
make
love
to
the
doves
shook
the
loose
dust
from
their
feathers
and
flew
away
peter
watched
to
see
where
they
went
but
lost
sight
of
them
behind
some
trees
so
decided
to
run
up
to
the
old
orchard
there
he
found
jenny
and
wren
as
busy
as
ever
feeding
that
growing
family
of
theirs
jenny
would
stop
an
instant
to
gossip
peter
was
so
brimful
of
what
he
had
found
out
about
and
dove
that
he
just
had
to
tell
some
one
he
heard
kitty
the
catbird
meowing
among
the
bushes
along
the
old
stone
wall
so
hurried
over
to
look
for
him
as
soon
as
he
found
him
peter
began
to
tell
what
he
had
learned
about
mourner
the
dove
that
no
news
peter
interrupted
kitty
i
know
all
about
mourner
and
his
wife
they
are
very
nice
people
though
i
must
say
dove
is
one
of
the
poorest
housekeepers
i
know
of
i
take
it
you
never
have
seen
her
peter
shook
his
head
no
said
he
i
have
what
is
it
like
kitty
the
catbird
laughed
it
about
the
poorest
apology
for
a
nest
i
know
of
said
he
it
is
made
of
little
sticks
and
mighty
few
of
them
how
they
hold
together
is
more
than
i
can
understand
i
guess
it
is
a
good
thing
that
dove
does
lay
more
than
two
eggs
and
it
a
wonder
to
me
that
those
two
stay
in
the
nest
listen
mourner
voice
now
for
one
who
is
so
happy
he
certainly
does
have
the
mournfullest
sounding
voice
to
hear
him
you
think
he
was
sorrowful
instead
of
happy
it
always
makes
me
feel
sad
to
hear
that
true
replied
peter
but
i
like
to
hear
him
just
the
same
hello
who
that
from
one
of
the
trees
in
the
old
orchard
sounded
a
long
clear
it
was
quite
unlike
any
voice
peter
had
heard
that
spring
that
cuckoo
said
kitty
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
cuckoo
of
course
i
know
him
retorted
peter
i
had
forgotten
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
all
tell
me
kitty
is
it
true
that
cuckoo
is
no
better
than
sally
sly
the
cowbird
and
goes
about
laying
her
eggs
in
the
nests
of
other
birds
i
heard
that
said
of
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
declared
kitty
emphatically
she
builds
a
nest
such
as
it
is
which
is
much
and
she
looks
after
her
own
children
the
cuckoos
have
been
given
a
bad
name
because
of
some
cousins
of
theirs
who
live
across
the
ocean
where
bully
the
english
sparrow
belongs
and
who
if
all
reports
are
true
really
are
no
better
than
sally
sly
the
cowbird
it
funny
how
a
bad
name
sticks
the
cuckoos
have
been
accused
of
stealing
the
eggs
of
us
other
birds
but
i
never
known
them
to
do
it
and
i
lived
neighbor
to
them
for
a
long
time
i
guess
they
get
their
bad
name
because
of
their
habit
of
slipping
about
silently
and
keeping
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
as
if
they
were
guilty
of
doing
something
wrong
and
trying
to
keep
from
being
seen
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
mighty
useful
birds
farmer
brown
ought
to
be
tickled
to
death
that
and
cuckoo
have
come
back
to
the
old
orchard
this
why
demanded
peter
do
you
see
that
cobwebby
nest
with
all
those
hairy
caterpillars
on
it
and
around
it
up
in
that
tree
asked
kitty
peter
replied
that
he
did
and
that
he
had
seen
a
great
many
nests
just
like
it
and
had
noticed
how
the
caterpillars
ate
all
the
leaves
near
them
i
venture
to
say
that
you
wo
see
very
many
leaves
eaten
around
that
nest
replied
kitty
those
are
called
and
they
do
an
awful
lot
of
damage
i
ca
bear
them
myself
because
they
are
so
hairy
and
very
few
birds
will
touch
them
but
cuckoo
likes
them
there
he
comes
now
just
watch
a
long
slim
looking
bird
alighted
close
to
the
nest
above
he
was
with
just
a
little
greenish
tinge
beneath
he
was
white
his
wings
were
his
tail
was
a
little
longer
than
that
of
mourner
the
dove
the
outer
feathers
were
black
tipped
with
white
while
the
middle
feathers
were
the
color
of
his
back
the
upper
half
of
his
bill
was
black
but
the
under
half
was
yellow
and
from
this
he
is
called
the
cuckoo
he
has
a
cousin
very
much
like
himself
in
appearance
save
that
his
bill
is
all
black
and
he
is
listed
the
cuckoo
cuckoo
made
no
sound
but
began
to
pick
off
the
hairy
caterpillars
and
swallow
them
when
he
had
eaten
all
those
in
sight
he
made
holes
in
the
silken
web
of
the
nest
and
picked
out
the
caterpillars
that
were
inside
finally
having
eaten
his
fill
he
flew
off
as
silently
as
he
had
come
and
disappeared
among
the
bushes
farther
along
the
old
stone
wall
a
moment
later
they
heard
his
voice
i
suppose
some
folks
would
think
that
it
is
going
to
rain
remarked
kitty
the
catbird
they
have
the
silly
notion
that
cuckoo
only
calls
just
before
rain
and
so
they
call
him
the
rain
crow
but
that
so
at
all
well
peter
i
guess
i
gossiped
enough
for
one
morning
i
must
go
see
how
catbird
is
getting
kitty
disappeared
and
peter
having
no
one
to
talk
to
decided
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
go
home
to
the
dear
old
chapter
xxxv
a
butcher
and
a
hummer
not
far
from
the
old
orchard
grew
a
which
peter
rabbit
often
passed
he
never
had
paid
particular
attention
to
it
one
morning
he
stopped
to
rest
under
it
happening
to
look
up
he
saw
a
most
astonishing
thing
fastened
on
the
sharp
thorns
of
one
of
the
branches
were
three
big
grasshoppers
a
big
moth
two
big
caterpillars
a
lizard
a
small
mouse
and
a
young
english
sparrow
do
you
wonder
that
peter
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
he
could
imagine
how
those
creatures
could
have
become
fastened
on
those
long
sharp
thorns
somehow
it
gave
him
an
uncomfortable
feeling
and
he
hurried
on
to
the
old
orchard
bubbling
over
with
desire
to
tell
some
one
of
the
strange
and
dreadful
thing
he
had
seen
in
the
as
he
entered
the
old
orchard
in
the
far
corner
he
saw
johnny
chuck
sitting
on
his
doorstep
and
hurried
over
to
tell
him
the
strange
news
johnny
listened
until
peter
was
through
then
told
him
quite
frankly
that
never
had
he
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
that
he
thought
peter
must
have
been
dreaming
and
did
know
it
you
wrong
johnny
chuck
peter
has
been
dreaming
at
all
said
skimmer
the
swallow
who
you
remember
lived
in
a
hole
in
a
tree
just
above
the
entrance
to
johnny
chuck
house
he
had
been
sitting
where
he
could
hear
all
that
peter
had
said
well
if
you
know
so
much
about
it
please
explain
said
johnny
chuck
rather
crossly
it
simple
enough
replied
skimmer
peter
just
happened
to
find
the
storehouse
of
butcher
the
loggerhead
shrike
it
is
a
very
pleasant
sight
i
must
admit
but
one
must
give
butcher
credit
for
being
smart
enough
to
lay
up
a
store
of
food
when
it
is
and
who
is
butcher
the
shrike
demanded
peter
he
a
new
one
to
me
he
new
to
this
location
replied
skimmer
and
you
probably
noticed
him
i
seen
him
in
the
south
often
there
he
is
now
on
the
tiptop
of
that
tree
over
peter
and
johnny
looked
eagerly
they
saw
a
bird
who
at
first
glance
appeared
not
unlike
mocker
the
mockingbird
he
was
dressed
wholly
in
black
gray
and
white
when
he
turned
his
head
they
noticed
a
black
stripe
across
the
side
of
his
face
and
that
the
tip
of
his
bill
was
hooked
these
are
enough
to
make
them
forget
that
otherwise
he
was
like
mocker
while
they
were
watching
him
he
flew
down
into
the
grass
and
picked
up
a
grasshopper
then
he
flew
with
a
steady
even
flight
only
a
little
above
the
ground
for
some
distance
suddenly
shooting
up
and
returning
to
the
perch
where
they
had
first
seen
him
there
he
ate
the
grasshopper
and
resumed
his
watch
for
something
else
to
catch
he
certainly
has
wonderful
eyes
said
skimmer
admiringly
he
mast
have
seen
that
grasshopper
way
over
there
in
the
grass
before
he
started
after
it
for
he
flew
straight
there
he
does
waste
time
and
energy
hunting
aimlessly
he
sits
on
a
high
perch
and
watches
until
he
sees
something
he
wants
many
times
i
seen
him
sitting
on
top
of
a
telegraph
pole
i
understand
that
bully
the
english
sparrow
has
become
terribly
nervous
since
the
arrival
of
butcher
he
is
particularly
fond
of
english
sparrows
i
presume
it
was
one
of
bully
children
you
saw
in
the
peter
for
my
part
i
hope
he
frighten
bully
into
leaving
the
old
orchard
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
rest
of
but
i
do
understand
yet
why
he
fastens
his
victims
on
those
long
thorns
said
peter
for
two
reasons
replied
skimmer
when
he
catches
more
grasshoppers
and
other
insects
than
he
can
eat
he
sticks
them
on
those
thorns
so
that
later
he
may
be
sure
of
a
good
meal
if
it
happens
there
are
no
more
to
be
caught
when
he
is
hungry
mice
sparrows
and
things
too
big
for
him
to
swallow
he
sticks
on
the
thorns
so
that
he
can
pull
them
to
pieces
easier
you
see
his
feet
and
claws
are
not
big
and
stout
enough
to
hold
his
victims
while
he
tears
them
to
pieces
with
his
hooked
bill
sometimes
instead
of
sticking
them
on
thorns
he
sticks
them
on
the
barbed
wire
of
a
fence
and
sometimes
he
wedges
them
into
the
fork
of
two
does
he
kill
many
birds
asked
peter
not
many
replied
skimmer
and
most
of
those
he
does
kill
are
english
sparrows
the
rest
of
us
have
learned
to
keep
out
of
his
way
he
feeds
mostly
on
insects
worms
and
caterpillars
but
he
is
very
fond
of
mice
and
he
catches
a
good
many
he
is
a
good
deal
like
killy
the
sparrow
hawk
in
this
respect
he
has
a
cousin
the
great
northern
shrike
who
sometimes
comes
down
in
the
winter
and
is
very
much
like
him
hello
now
what
happened
a
great
commotion
had
broken
out
not
far
away
in
the
old
orchard
instantly
skimmer
flew
over
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
and
peter
followed
he
got
there
just
in
time
to
see
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
dodging
around
the
trunk
of
a
tree
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
to
avoid
the
sharp
bills
of
the
angry
feathered
folk
who
had
discovered
him
trying
to
rob
a
nest
of
its
young
peter
chuckled
chatterer
is
getting
just
what
is
due
him
i
guess
he
muttered
it
reminds
me
of
the
time
i
got
into
a
yellow
jacket
nest
my
but
those
birds
are
mad
chatterer
continued
to
dodge
from
side
to
side
of
the
tree
while
the
birds
darted
down
at
him
all
screaming
at
the
top
of
their
voices
finally
chatterer
saw
his
chance
to
run
for
the
old
stone
wall
only
one
bird
was
quick
enough
to
catch
up
with
him
and
that
one
was
such
a
tiny
fellow
that
he
seemed
hardly
bigger
than
a
big
insect
it
was
hammer
the
hummingbird
he
followed
chatterer
clear
to
the
old
stone
wall
a
moment
later
peter
heard
a
humming
noise
just
over
his
head
and
looked
up
to
see
hummer
himself
alight
on
a
twig
where
he
squeaked
excitedly
for
a
few
minutes
for
his
voice
is
nothing
but
a
little
squeak
often
peter
had
seen
hummer
darting
about
from
flower
to
flower
and
holding
himself
still
in
in
front
of
each
as
he
thrust
his
long
bill
into
the
heart
of
the
blossom
to
get
the
tiny
insects
there
and
the
sweet
juices
he
is
so
fond
of
but
this
was
the
first
time
peter
had
ever
seen
him
sitting
still
he
was
such
a
mite
of
a
thing
that
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
he
was
a
bird
his
back
was
a
bright
shining
green
his
wings
and
tail
were
brownish
with
a
purplish
tinge
underneath
he
was
whitish
but
it
was
his
throat
on
which
peter
fixed
his
eyes
it
was
a
wonderful
that
glistened
and
shone
in
the
sun
like
a
jewel
hummer
lifted
one
wing
and
with
his
long
bill
smoothed
the
feathers
under
it
then
he
darted
out
into
the
air
his
wings
moving
so
fast
that
peter
could
see
them
at
all
but
if
he
could
see
them
he
could
hear
them
you
see
they
moved
so
fast
that
they
made
a
sound
very
like
the
humming
of
bumble
the
bee
it
is
because
of
this
that
he
is
called
the
hummingbird
a
fey
minutes
later
he
was
back
again
and
now
he
was
joined
by
hummer
she
was
dressed
very
much
like
hummer
but
did
not
have
the
beautiful
ruby
throat
she
stopped
only
a
minute
or
two
then
darted
over
to
what
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
tiny
cup
of
moss
it
was
their
nest
just
then
jenny
wren
came
along
and
being
quite
worn
out
with
the
work
of
feeding
her
seven
babies
she
was
content
to
rest
for
a
few
moments
and
gossip
peter
told
her
what
he
had
discovered
i
know
all
about
that
retorted
jenny
you
do
suppose
i
hunt
these
trees
over
for
food
without
knowing
where
my
neighbors
are
living
do
you
i
have
you
to
understand
peter
that
that
is
the
daintiest
nest
in
the
old
orchard
it
is
made
wholly
of
plant
down
and
covered
on
the
outside
with
bits
of
that
gray
stuff
that
grows
on
the
bark
of
the
trees
and
is
called
lichens
that
is
what
makes
that
nest
look
like
nothing
more
than
a
knot
on
the
branch
chatterer
made
a
big
mistake
when
he
visited
this
tree
hummer
may
be
a
tiny
fellow
but
he
afraid
of
anybody
under
the
sun
that
bill
of
his
is
so
sharp
and
he
is
so
quick
that
few
folks
ever
bother
him
more
than
once
why
there
a
single
member
of
the
hawk
family
that
hummer
wo
attack
there
a
cowardly
feather
on
does
he
go
very
far
south
for
the
winter
asked
peter
he
is
such
a
tiny
fellow
i
do
see
how
he
can
stand
a
very
long
huh
exclaimed
jenny
wren
distance
does
bother
hummer
any
you
need
worry
about
those
wings
of
his
he
goes
clear
down
to
south
america
he
has
ever
so
many
relatives
down
there
you
ought
to
see
his
babies
when
they
first
hatch
out
they
are
no
bigger
than
bees
but
they
certainly
do
grow
fast
why
they
are
flying
three
weeks
from
the
time
they
hatch
i
glad
i
do
have
to
pump
food
down
the
throats
of
my
youngsters
the
way
hummingbird
has
to
down
peter
looked
perplexed
what
do
you
mean
by
pumping
food
down
their
throats
he
demanded
just
what
i
say
retorted
jenny
wren
mrs
hummer
sticks
her
bill
right
down
their
throats
and
then
pumps
up
the
food
she
has
already
swallowed
i
guess
it
is
a
good
thing
that
the
babies
have
short
do
they
asked
peter
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
with
surprise
yes
replied
jenny
when
they
hatch
out
they
have
short
bills
but
it
does
take
them
a
great
while
to
grow
how
many
babies
does
hummer
usually
have
asked
peter
just
two
replied
jenny
just
two
that
all
that
nest
will
hold
but
goodness
gracious
peter
i
ca
stop
gossiping
here
any
longer
you
have
no
idea
what
a
care
seven
babies
with
a
jerk
of
her
tail
off
flew
jenny
wren
and
peter
hurried
back
to
tell
johnny
chuck
all
he
had
found
out
about
hummer
the
hummingbird
chapter
xxxvi
a
stranger
and
a
dandy
butcher
the
shrike
was
not
the
only
newcomer
in
the
old
orchard
there
was
another
stranger
who
peter
rabbit
soon
discovered
was
looked
on
with
some
suspicion
by
all
the
other
birds
of
the
old
orchard
the
first
time
peter
saw
him
he
was
walking
about
on
the
ground
some
distance
off
he
did
hop
but
walked
and
at
that
distance
he
looked
all
black
the
way
he
carried
himself
and
his
movements
as
he
walked
made
peter
think
of
creaker
the
grackle
in
fact
peter
mistook
him
for
creaker
that
was
because
he
did
really
look
at
him
if
he
had
he
would
have
seen
at
once
that
the
stranger
was
smaller
than
creaker
presently
the
stranger
flew
up
in
a
tree
and
peter
saw
that
his
tail
was
little
more
than
half
as
long
as
that
of
creaker
at
once
it
came
over
peter
that
this
was
a
stranger
to
him
and
of
course
his
curiosity
was
aroused
he
did
have
any
doubt
whatever
that
this
was
a
member
of
the
blackbird
family
but
which
one
it
could
be
he
had
the
least
idea
jenny
wren
will
know
thought
peter
and
scampered
off
to
hunt
her
up
who
is
that
new
member
of
the
blackbird
family
who
has
come
to
live
in
the
old
orchard
peter
asked
as
soon
as
he
found
jenny
wren
there
is
any
new
member
of
the
blackbird
family
living
in
the
old
orchard
retorted
jenny
wren
tartly
there
is
too
contradicted
peter
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
i
can
see
him
now
he
sitting
in
that
tree
over
yonder
this
very
minute
he
all
black
so
of
course
he
must
be
a
member
of
the
blackbird
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
scolded
jenny
wren
tut
tut
tut
tut
tut
that
fellow
is
a
member
of
the
blackbird
family
at
all
and
more
he
is
black
go
over
there
and
take
a
good
look
at
him
then
come
back
and
tell
me
if
you
still
think
he
is
jenny
turned
her
back
on
peter
and
went
to
hunting
worms
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
peter
hopped
over
where
he
could
get
a
good
look
at
the
stranger
the
sun
was
shining
full
on
him
and
he
was
black
at
all
jenny
wren
was
right
for
the
most
part
he
was
very
dark
green
at
least
that
is
what
peter
thought
at
first
glance
then
as
the
stranger
moved
he
seemed
to
be
a
rich
purple
in
places
in
short
he
changed
color
as
he
turned
his
feathers
were
like
those
of
creaker
the
grackle
iridescent
all
over
he
was
speckled
with
tiny
light
spots
underneath
he
was
dark
his
wings
and
tail
were
of
the
same
color
with
little
touches
of
buff
his
rather
large
bill
was
yellow
peter
hurried
back
to
jenny
wren
and
it
must
be
confessed
he
looked
sheepish
you
were
right
jenny
wren
he
is
black
at
all
confessed
peter
of
course
i
was
right
i
usually
am
retorted
jenny
he
black
he
is
even
related
to
the
blackbird
family
and
he
any
business
in
the
old
orchard
in
fact
if
you
ask
me
he
has
any
business
in
this
country
anyway
he
a
foreigner
that
what
he
is
a
but
you
have
told
me
who
he
is
protested
peter
he
is
speckles
the
starling
and
he
is
really
an
american
at
all
replied
jenny
he
comes
from
across
the
ocean
the
same
as
bully
the
english
sparrow
thank
goodness
he
has
such
a
quarrelsome
disposition
as
bully
just
the
same
the
rest
of
us
would
be
better
satisfied
if
he
were
not
here
he
has
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
old
homes
of
yellow
wing
the
flicker
and
that
means
one
less
house
for
birds
who
really
belong
here
if
his
family
increases
at
the
rate
bully
family
does
i
afraid
some
of
us
will
soon
be
crowded
out
of
the
old
orchard
did
you
notice
that
yellow
bill
of
his
peter
nodded
i
certainly
did
said
he
i
could
very
well
help
noticing
well
there
a
funny
thing
about
that
bill
replied
jenny
in
winter
it
turns
almost
black
most
of
us
wear
a
different
colored
suit
in
winter
but
our
bills
remain
the
well
he
seems
to
be
pretty
well
fixed
here
and
i
do
see
but
what
the
thing
for
the
rest
of
you
birds
to
do
is
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
said
peter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
or
not
he
is
of
any
i
guess
he
must
do
some
good
admitted
jenny
wren
rather
grudgingly
i
seen
him
picking
up
worms
and
grubs
but
he
likes
grain
and
i
have
a
suspicion
that
if
his
family
becomes
very
numerous
and
i
suspect
it
will
they
will
eat
more
of
farmer
brown
grain
than
they
will
pay
for
by
the
worms
and
bugs
they
destroy
hello
there
dandy
the
waxwing
and
his
a
flock
of
modestly
dressed
yet
rather
distinguished
looking
feathered
folks
had
alighted
in
a
and
promptly
began
to
help
themselves
to
farmer
brown
cherries
they
were
about
the
size
of
winsome
bluebird
but
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
him
for
they
were
dressed
almost
wholly
in
beautiful
rich
soft
across
the
end
of
each
tail
was
a
yellow
band
on
each
the
forehead
chin
and
a
line
through
each
eye
was
each
wore
a
very
stylish
pointed
cap
and
on
the
wings
of
most
of
them
were
little
spots
of
red
which
looked
like
and
from
which
they
get
the
name
of
waxwings
they
were
slim
and
trim
and
quite
dandified
and
in
a
quiet
way
were
really
beautiful
as
peter
watched
them
he
began
to
wonder
if
farmer
brown
would
have
any
cherries
left
peter
himself
can
do
pretty
well
in
the
matter
of
stuffing
his
stomach
but
even
he
marvelled
at
the
way
those
birds
put
the
cherries
out
of
sight
it
was
quite
clear
to
him
why
they
are
often
called
cherrybirds
if
they
stay
long
farmer
brown
wo
have
any
cherries
left
remarked
peter
do
worry
replied
jenny
wren
they
wo
stay
long
i
know
anybody
equal
to
them
for
roaming
about
here
are
most
of
us
with
families
on
our
hands
and
and
bluebird
with
a
second
family
and
and
robin
with
a
second
set
of
eggs
while
those
gadabouts
up
there
have
even
begun
to
think
about
housekeeping
yet
they
certainly
do
like
those
cherries
but
i
guess
farmer
brown
can
stand
the
loss
of
what
they
eat
he
may
have
fewer
cherries
but
he
have
more
apples
because
of
bow
that
demanded
peter
oh
replied
jenny
wren
they
were
over
here
a
while
ago
when
those
little
green
cankerworms
threatened
to
eat
up
the
whole
orchard
and
they
stuffed
themselves
on
those
worms
just
the
same
as
they
are
stuffing
themselves
on
cherries
now
they
are
very
fond
of
small
fruits
but
most
of
those
they
eat
are
the
wild
kind
which
are
of
no
use
at
all
to
farmer
brown
or
anybody
else
now
just
look
at
that
performance
will
you
there
were
five
of
the
waxwings
and
they
were
now
seated
side
by
side
on
a
branch
of
the
cherry
tree
one
of
them
had
a
plump
cherry
which
he
passed
to
the
next
one
this
one
passed
it
on
to
the
next
and
so
it
went
to
the
end
of
the
row
and
halfway
back
before
it
was
finally
eaten
peter
laughed
right
out
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
such
politeness
said
he
huh
exclaimed
jenny
wren
i
do
believe
it
was
politeness
at
all
i
guess
if
you
got
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
you
would
find
that
each
one
was
stuffed
so
full
that
he
thought
he
did
have
room
for
that
cherry
and
so
passed
it
well
i
think
that
was
politeness
just
the
same
retorted
peter
the
first
one
might
have
dropped
the
cherry
if
he
could
eat
it
instead
of
passing
it
just
then
the
waxwings
flew
away
it
was
the
very
middle
of
the
summer
before
peter
rabbit
again
saw
dandy
the
waxwing
quite
by
chance
he
discovered
dandy
sitting
on
the
tiptop
of
an
evergreen
tree
as
if
on
guard
he
was
on
guard
for
in
that
tree
was
his
nest
though
peter
did
know
it
at
the
time
in
fact
it
was
so
late
in
the
summer
that
most
of
peter
friends
were
through
nesting
and
he
had
quite
lost
interest
in
nests
presently
dandy
flew
down
to
a
lower
branch
and
there
he
was
joined
by
waxwing
then
peter
was
treated
to
one
of
the
prettiest
sights
he
ever
had
seen
they
rubbed
their
bills
together
as
if
kissing
they
smoothed
each
other
feathers
and
altogether
were
a
perfect
picture
of
two
little
lovebirds
peter
could
think
of
another
couple
who
appeared
quite
so
gentle
and
loving
late
in
the
fall
peter
saw
and
waxwing
and
their
family
together
they
were
in
a
cedar
tree
and
were
picking
off
and
eating
the
cedar
berries
as
busily
as
the
five
waxwings
had
picked
farmer
cherries
in
the
early
summer
peter
did
know
it
but
because
of
their
fondness
for
cedar
berries
the
waxwings
were
often
called
cedarbirds
or
cedar
waxwings
chapter
xxxvii
farewells
and
welcomes
all
through
the
long
summer
peter
rabbit
watched
his
feathered
friends
and
learned
things
in
regard
to
their
ways
he
never
had
suspected
as
he
saw
them
keeping
the
trees
of
the
old
orchard
free
of
insect
pests
working
in
farmer
brown
garden
and
picking
up
the
countless
seeds
of
weeds
everywhere
he
began
to
understand
something
of
the
wonderful
part
these
feathered
folks
have
in
keeping
the
great
world
beautiful
and
worth
while
living
in
he
had
many
a
hearty
laugh
as
he
watched
the
bird
babies
learn
to
fly
and
to
find
their
own
food
all
summer
long
they
were
going
to
school
all
about
him
learning
how
to
watch
out
for
danger
to
use
their
eyes
and
ears
and
all
the
things
a
bird
must
know
who
would
live
to
grow
up
as
autumn
drew
near
peter
discovered
that
his
friends
were
gathering
in
flocks
roaming
here
and
there
it
was
one
of
the
first
signs
that
summer
was
nearly
over
and
it
gave
him
just
a
little
feeling
of
sadness
he
heard
few
songs
now
for
the
singing
season
was
over
also
he
discovered
that
many
of
the
most
beautifully
dressed
of
his
feathered
friends
had
changed
their
finery
for
sober
traveling
suits
in
preparation
for
the
long
journey
to
the
far
south
where
they
would
spend
the
winter
in
fact
he
actually
failed
to
recognize
some
of
them
at
first
september
came
and
as
the
days
grew
shorter
some
of
peter
friends
bade
him
they
were
starting
on
the
long
journey
planning
to
take
it
in
easy
stages
for
the
most
part
each
day
saw
some
slip
away
as
peter
thought
of
the
dangers
of
the
long
trip
before
them
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
see
them
again
but
some
there
were
who
lingered
even
after
jack
frost
first
visit
welcome
and
robin
winsome
and
bluebird
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
and
his
wife
were
among
these
by
and
by
even
they
were
forced
to
leave
sad
indeed
and
lonely
would
these
days
have
been
for
peter
had
it
not
been
that
with
the
departure
of
the
friends
he
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
with
came
the
arrival
of
certain
other
friends
from
the
far
north
where
they
had
made
their
summer
homes
some
of
these
stopped
for
a
few
days
in
passing
others
came
to
stay
and
peter
was
kept
busy
looking
for
and
welcoming
them
a
few
old
friends
there
were
who
would
stay
the
year
through
sammy
jay
was
one
downy
and
hairy
the
woodpeckers
were
others
and
one
there
was
whom
peter
loves
dearly
it
was
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
now
tommy
tit
had
not
gone
north
in
the
spring
in
fact
he
had
made
his
home
not
very
far
from
the
old
orchard
it
just
happened
that
peter
had
found
that
home
and
had
caught
only
one
or
two
glimpses
of
tommy
tit
now
with
household
cares
ended
and
his
family
properly
started
in
life
tommy
tit
was
no
longer
interested
in
the
snug
little
home
he
had
built
in
a
hollow
and
he
and
chickadee
spent
their
time
flitting
about
hither
thither
and
yon
spreading
good
cheer
every
time
peter
visited
the
old
orchard
he
found
him
there
and
as
tommy
was
always
ready
for
a
bit
of
merry
gossip
peter
soon
ceased
to
miss
jenny
wren
do
you
dread
the
winter
tommy
tit
asked
peter
one
day
as
he
watched
tommy
clinging
head
down
to
a
twig
as
he
picked
some
tiny
insect
eggs
from
the
under
side
not
a
bit
replied
tommy
i
like
winter
i
like
cold
weather
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
good
from
the
tips
of
his
claws
to
the
tip
of
his
bill
i
thankful
i
do
have
to
take
that
long
journey
most
of
the
birds
have
to
i
discovered
a
secret
a
long
time
ago
peter
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
please
tommy
cried
peter
you
know
how
i
love
well
replied
tommy
tit
this
is
it
if
a
fellow
keeps
his
stomach
filled
he
will
beep
his
toes
peter
looked
a
little
puzzled
i
i
do
just
see
what
your
stomach
has
to
do
with
your
toes
said
he
tommy
tit
chuckled
it
was
a
lovely
throaty
little
chuckle
dee
dee
dee
said
he
what
i
mean
is
if
a
fellow
has
plenty
to
eat
he
will
keep
the
cold
out
and
i
found
that
if
a
fellow
uses
his
eyes
and
is
afraid
of
a
little
work
he
can
find
plenty
to
eat
at
least
i
can
the
only
time
i
ever
get
really
worried
is
when
the
trees
are
covered
with
ice
if
it
were
not
that
farmer
brown
boy
is
thoughtful
enough
to
hang
a
piece
of
suet
in
a
tree
for
me
i
should
dread
those
ice
storms
more
than
i
do
as
i
said
before
plenty
of
food
keeps
a
fellow
i
thought
it
was
your
coat
of
feathers
that
kept
you
warm
said
peter
oh
the
feathers
help
replied
tommy
tit
food
makes
heat
and
a
warm
coat
keeps
the
heat
in
the
body
but
the
heat
has
got
to
be
there
first
or
the
feathers
will
do
no
good
it
just
the
same
way
with
your
own
self
peter
you
know
you
are
never
really
warm
in
winter
unless
you
have
plenty
to
eat
that
so
replied
peter
thoughtfully
i
never
happened
to
think
of
it
before
just
the
same
i
do
see
how
you
find
food
enough
on
the
trees
when
they
are
all
bare
in
dee
dee
chickadee
leave
that
matter
just
to
me
chuckled
tommy
tit
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
peter
rabbit
that
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
bugs
lay
eggs
on
the
twigs
and
trunks
of
trees
those
eggs
would
stay
there
all
winter
and
in
the
spring
hatch
out
into
lice
and
worms
if
it
were
not
for
me
why
sometimes
in
a
single
day
i
find
and
eat
almost
five
hundred
eggs
of
those
little
green
plant
lice
that
do
so
much
damage
in
the
spring
and
summer
then
there
are
little
worms
that
bore
in
just
under
the
bark
and
there
are
other
creatures
who
sleep
the
winter
away
in
little
cracks
in
the
bark
oh
there
is
plenty
for
me
to
do
in
the
winter
i
am
one
of
the
policemen
of
the
trees
downy
and
hairy
the
woodpeckers
the
brown
creeper
and
the
nuthatch
are
others
if
we
did
stay
right
here
on
the
job
all
winter
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
the
old
tommy
tit
hung
head
downward
from
a
twig
while
he
picked
some
tiny
insect
eggs
from
the
under
side
of
it
it
did
seem
to
make
the
least
difference
to
tommy
whether
he
was
right
side
up
or
upside
down
he
was
a
little
animated
bunch
of
black
and
white
feathers
not
much
bigger
than
jenny
wren
the
top
of
his
head
back
of
his
neck
and
coat
were
shining
black
the
sides
of
his
head
and
neck
were
white
his
back
was
ashy
his
sides
were
a
soft
and
his
wing
and
tail
feathers
were
edged
with
white
his
tiny
bill
was
black
and
his
little
black
eyes
snapped
and
twinkled
in
a
way
good
to
see
not
one
among
all
peter
friends
is
such
a
little
fellow
as
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
merriment
and
happiness
bubble
out
of
him
all
the
time
no
matter
what
the
weather
is
he
is
the
friend
of
everyone
and
seems
to
feel
that
everyone
is
his
friend
i
noticed
said
peter
that
birds
who
do
not
sing
at
any
other
time
of
year
sing
in
the
spring
do
you
have
a
spring
song
tommy
tit
well
i
do
know
as
you
would
call
it
a
song
peter
chuckled
tommy
no
i
hardly
think
you
would
call
it
a
song
but
i
have
a
little
love
call
then
which
goes
like
this
it
was
the
softest
sweetest
little
whistle
and
tommy
had
rightly
called
it
a
love
call
why
i
often
heard
that
in
the
spring
and
did
know
it
was
your
voice
at
all
cried
peter
you
say
phoebe
plainer
than
does
the
bird
who
is
named
phoebe
and
it
is
ever
so
much
softer
and
sweeter
i
guess
that
is
because
you
whistle
i
guess
you
guess
right
replied
tommy
tit
now
i
ca
stop
to
talk
any
longer
these
trees
need
my
attention
i
want
farmer
brown
boy
to
feel
that
i
have
earned
that
suet
i
am
sure
he
will
put
out
for
me
as
soon
as
the
snow
and
ice
come
i
not
the
least
bit
afraid
of
farmer
brown
boy
i
had
just
as
soon
take
food
from
his
hand
as
from
anywhere
else
he
knows
i
like
and
last
winter
i
used
to
feed
from
his
hand
every
peter
eyes
opened
very
wide
with
surprise
do
you
mean
to
say
said
he
that
you
and
farmer
boy
are
such
friends
that
you
dare
sit
on
his
hand
tommy
tit
nodded
his
little
head
vigorously
certainly
said
he
why
not
what
the
good
of
having
friends
if
you
ca
trust
them
the
more
you
trust
them
the
better
friends
they
just
the
same
i
do
see
how
you
dare
to
do
it
peter
replied
i
know
farmer
brown
boy
is
the
friend
of
all
the
little
people
and
not
much
afraid
of
him
myself
but
just
the
same
i
would
dare
go
near
enough
for
him
to
touch
pooh
retorted
tommy
tit
that
no
way
of
showing
true
friendship
you
no
idea
peter
what
a
comfortable
feeling
it
is
to
know
that
you
can
trust
a
friend
and
i
feel
that
farmer
brown
boy
is
one
of
the
best
friends
i
got
i
wish
more
boys
and
girls
were
like
chapter
xxxviii
honker
and
dippy
arrive
the
leaves
of
the
trees
turned
yellow
and
red
and
brown
and
then
began
to
drop
a
few
at
first
then
more
and
more
every
day
until
all
but
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
were
bare
by
this
time
most
of
peter
feathered
friends
of
the
summer
had
departed
and
there
were
days
when
peter
had
oh
such
a
lonely
feeling
the
fur
of
his
coat
was
growing
thicker
the
grass
of
the
green
meadows
had
turned
brown
all
these
things
were
signs
which
peter
knew
well
he
knew
that
rough
brother
north
wind
and
jack
frost
were
on
their
way
down
from
the
far
north
peter
had
few
friends
to
visit
now
johnny
chuck
had
gone
to
sleep
for
the
winter
down
in
his
little
bedroom
under
ground
grandfather
frog
had
also
gone
to
sleep
so
had
old
toad
peter
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
dear
old
just
sitting
still
and
listening
what
he
was
listening
for
he
did
know
it
just
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
he
ought
to
hear
at
this
time
of
year
and
so
he
sat
listening
and
listening
and
wondering
what
he
was
listening
for
then
late
one
afternoon
there
came
floating
down
to
him
from
high
up
in
the
sky
faintly
at
first
but
growing
louder
a
sound
unlike
any
peter
had
heard
all
the
long
summer
through
the
sound
was
a
voice
rather
it
was
many
voices
mingled
honk
honk
honk
honk
honk
honk
honk
peter
gave
a
little
jump
that
what
i
been
listening
for
he
cried
honker
the
goose
and
his
friends
are
coming
oh
i
do
hope
they
will
stop
where
i
can
pay
them
a
he
hopped
out
to
the
edge
of
the
dear
old
that
he
might
see
better
and
looked
up
in
the
sky
high
up
flying
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
v
he
saw
a
flock
of
great
birds
flying
steadily
from
the
direction
of
the
far
north
by
the
sound
of
their
voices
he
knew
that
they
had
flown
far
that
day
and
were
tired
one
bird
was
in
the
lead
and
this
he
knew
to
be
his
old
friend
honker
straight
over
his
head
they
passed
and
as
peter
listened
to
their
voices
he
felt
within
him
the
very
spirit
of
the
far
north
that
great
wild
lonely
land
which
he
had
never
seen
but
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
as
peter
watched
honker
suddenly
turned
and
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
big
river
then
he
began
to
slant
down
his
flock
following
him
and
presently
they
disappeared
behind
the
trees
along
the
bank
of
the
great
river
peter
gave
a
happy
little
sigh
they
are
going
to
spend
the
night
there
thought
he
when
the
moon
comes
up
i
will
run
over
there
for
they
will
come
ashore
and
i
know
just
where
now
that
they
have
arrived
i
know
that
winter
is
not
far
away
honker
voice
is
as
sure
a
sign
of
the
coming
of
winter
as
is
winsome
bluebird
that
spring
will
soon
be
peter
could
hardly
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
black
shadows
and
just
as
soon
as
they
had
crept
out
over
the
green
meadows
he
started
for
the
big
river
he
knew
just
where
to
go
because
he
knew
that
honker
and
his
friends
would
rest
and
spend
the
night
in
the
same
place
they
had
stopped
at
the
year
before
he
knew
that
they
would
remain
out
in
the
middle
of
the
big
river
until
the
black
shadows
had
made
it
quite
safe
for
them
to
swim
in
he
reached
the
bank
of
the
big
river
just
as
sweet
mistress
moon
was
beginning
to
throw
her
silvery
light
over
the
great
world
there
was
a
sandy
bar
in
the
great
river
at
this
point
and
peter
squatted
on
the
bank
just
where
this
sandy
bar
began
it
seemed
to
peter
that
he
had
sat
there
half
the
night
but
really
it
was
only
a
short
time
before
he
heard
a
low
signal
out
in
the
black
shadows
which
covered
the
middle
of
the
big
river
it
was
the
voice
of
honker
then
peter
saw
little
silvery
lines
moving
on
the
water
and
presently
a
dozen
great
shapes
appeared
in
the
moonlight
honker
and
his
friends
were
swimming
in
the
long
neck
of
each
of
those
great
birds
was
stretched
to
its
full
height
and
peter
knew
that
each
bird
was
listening
for
the
slightest
suspicious
sound
slowly
they
drew
near
honker
in
the
lead
they
were
a
picture
of
perfect
caution
when
they
reached
the
sandy
bar
they
remained
quiet
looking
and
listening
for
some
time
then
sure
that
all
was
safe
honker
gave
a
low
signal
and
at
once
a
low
gabbling
began
as
the
big
birds
relaxed
their
watchfulness
and
came
out
on
the
sandy
bar
all
save
one
that
one
was
the
guard
and
he
remained
with
neck
erect
on
watch
some
swam
in
among
the
rushes
growing
in
the
water
very
near
to
where
peter
was
sitting
and
began
to
feed
others
sat
on
the
sandy
bar
and
dressed
their
feathers
honker
himself
came
ashore
close
to
where
peter
was
sitting
oh
honker
cried
peter
i
so
glad
you
back
here
safe
and
honker
gave
a
little
start
but
instantly
recognizing
peter
came
over
close
to
him
as
he
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
he
was
truly
handsome
his
throat
and
a
large
patch
on
each
side
of
his
head
were
white
the
rest
of
his
head
and
long
slim
neck
were
black
his
short
tail
was
also
black
his
back
wings
breast
and
sides
were
a
soft
he
was
white
around
the
base
of
his
tail
and
he
wore
a
white
collar
hello
peter
said
he
it
is
good
to
have
an
old
friend
greet
me
i
certainly
am
glad
to
be
back
safe
and
sound
for
the
hunters
with
terrible
guns
have
been
at
almost
every
one
of
our
resting
places
and
it
has
been
hard
work
to
get
enough
to
eat
it
is
a
relief
to
find
one
place
where
there
are
no
terrible
have
you
come
far
asked
peter
very
far
peter
very
far
replied
honker
and
we
still
have
very
far
to
go
i
shall
be
thankful
when
the
journey
is
over
for
on
me
depends
the
safety
of
all
those
with
me
and
it
is
a
great
will
winter
soon
be
here
asked
peter
eagerly
rough
brother
north
wind
and
jack
frost
were
right
behind
us
replied
honker
you
know
we
stay
in
the
far
north
just
as
long
as
we
can
already
the
place
where
we
nested
is
frozen
and
covered
with
snow
for
the
first
part
of
the
journey
we
kept
only
just
ahead
of
the
snow
and
ice
but
as
we
drew
near
to
where
men
make
their
homes
we
were
forced
to
make
longer
journeys
each
day
for
the
places
where
it
is
safe
to
feed
and
rest
are
few
and
far
between
now
we
shall
hurry
on
until
we
reach
the
place
in
the
south
where
we
will
make
our
winter
just
then
honker
was
interrupted
by
wild
strange
sounds
from
the
middle
of
the
great
river
it
sounded
like
crazy
laughter
peter
jumped
at
the
sound
but
honker
merely
chuckled
it
dippy
the
loon
said
he
he
spent
the
summer
in
the
far
north
not
far
from
us
he
started
south
just
before
we
i
wish
he
would
come
in
here
so
that
i
can
get
a
good
look
at
him
and
make
his
acquaintance
said
peter
he
may
but
i
doubt
it
replied
honker
he
and
his
mate
are
great
people
to
keep
by
themselves
then
too
they
do
have
to
come
ashore
for
food
you
know
dippy
feeds
altogether
on
fish
he
really
has
an
easier
time
on
the
long
journey
than
we
do
because
he
can
get
his
food
without
running
so
much
risk
of
being
shot
by
the
terrible
hunters
he
practically
lives
on
the
water
he
about
the
most
awkward
fellow
on
land
of
any
one
i
why
should
he
be
any
more
awkward
on
land
then
you
asked
peter
his
curiosity
aroused
at
once
because
replied
honker
old
mother
nature
has
given
him
very
short
legs
and
has
placed
them
so
far
back
on
his
body
that
he
ca
keep
his
balance
to
walk
and
has
to
use
his
wings
and
bill
to
help
him
over
the
ground
on
shore
he
is
about
the
most
helpless
thing
you
can
imagine
but
on
water
he
is
another
fellow
altogether
he
just
as
much
at
home
under
water
as
on
top
my
how
that
fellow
can
dive
when
he
sees
the
flash
of
a
gun
he
will
get
under
water
before
the
shot
can
reach
him
that
where
he
has
the
advantage
of
us
geese
you
know
we
ca
dive
he
could
swim
clear
across
this
river
under
water
if
he
wanted
to
and
he
can
go
so
fast
under
water
that
he
can
catch
a
fish
it
is
because
his
legs
have
been
placed
so
far
back
that
he
can
swim
so
fast
you
know
his
feet
are
nothing
but
big
paddles
another
funny
thing
is
that
he
can
sink
right
down
in
the
water
when
he
wants
to
with
nothing
but
his
head
out
i
envy
him
that
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
for
us
geese
to
escape
the
dreadful
hunters
if
we
could
sink
down
that
has
he
a
bill
like
yours
asked
peter
innocently
of
course
not
replied
honker
did
i
tell
you
that
he
lives
on
fish
how
do
you
suppose
he
would
hold
on
to
his
slippery
fish
if
he
had
a
broad
bill
like
mine
his
bill
is
stout
straight
and
sharp
pointed
he
is
rather
a
handsome
fellow
he
is
pretty
nearly
as
big
as
i
am
and
his
back
wings
tail
and
neck
are
black
with
bluish
or
greenish
appearance
in
the
sun
his
back
and
wings
are
spotted
with
white
and
there
are
streaks
of
white
on
his
throat
and
the
sides
of
his
neck
on
his
breast
and
below
he
is
all
white
you
certainly
ought
to
get
acquainted
with
dippy
peter
for
there
is
anybody
quite
like
i
like
to
replied
peter
but
if
he
never
comes
to
shore
how
can
i
i
guess
i
will
have
to
be
content
to
know
him
just
by
his
voice
i
certainly
never
will
forget
that
it
about
as
crazy
sounding
as
the
voice
of
old
man
coyote
and
that
is
saying
a
great
there
one
thing
i
forgot
to
tell
you
said
honker
dippy
ca
fly
from
the
land
he
must
be
on
the
water
in
order
to
get
up
in
the
you
can
ca
you
asked
peter
of
course
i
can
replied
honker
why
we
geese
get
a
lot
of
our
food
on
land
when
it
is
safe
to
do
so
we
visit
the
grain
fields
and
pick
up
the
grain
that
has
been
shaken
out
during
harvest
of
course
we
do
that
if
we
could
fly
from
the
land
we
can
rise
from
either
land
or
water
equally
well
now
if
you
excuse
me
peter
i
take
a
nap
my
but
i
tired
and
i
got
a
long
journey
so
peter
politely
bade
honker
and
his
relatives
and
left
them
in
peace
on
the
sandy
bar
in
the
big
river
chapter
xxxix
peter
discovers
two
old
friends
rough
brother
north
wind
and
jack
frost
were
not
far
behind
honker
the
goose
in
a
night
peter
rabbit
world
was
transformed
it
had
become
a
new
world
a
world
of
pure
white
the
last
laggard
among
feathered
friends
who
spend
the
winter
in
the
south
had
hurried
away
still
peter
was
not
lonely
tommy
tit
cheery
voice
greeted
peter
the
very
first
thing
that
morning
after
the
storm
tommy
seemed
to
be
in
just
as
good
spirits
as
ever
he
had
been
in
summer
now
peter
rather
likes
the
snow
he
likes
to
run
about
in
it
and
so
he
followed
tommy
tit
up
to
the
old
orchard
he
felt
sure
that
he
would
find
company
there
besides
tommy
tit
and
he
was
not
disappointed
downy
and
hairy
the
woodpeckers
were
getting
their
breakfast
from
a
piece
of
suet
farmer
brown
boy
had
thoughtfully
fastened
in
one
of
the
for
them
sammy
jay
was
there
also
and
his
blue
coat
never
had
looked
better
than
it
did
against
the
pure
white
of
the
snow
these
were
the
only
ones
peter
really
had
expected
to
find
in
the
old
orchard
and
so
you
can
guess
how
pleased
he
was
as
he
hopped
over
the
old
stone
wall
to
hear
the
voice
of
one
whom
he
had
almost
forgotten
it
was
the
voice
of
the
nuthatch
and
while
it
was
far
from
being
sweet
there
was
in
it
something
of
good
cheer
and
contentment
at
once
peter
hurried
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
on
the
trunk
of
an
he
caught
sight
of
a
gray
and
black
and
white
bird
about
the
size
of
downy
the
woodpecker
the
top
of
his
head
and
upper
part
of
his
back
were
shining
black
the
rest
of
his
back
was
the
sides
of
his
head
and
his
breast
were
white
the
outer
feathers
of
his
tail
were
black
with
white
patches
near
their
tips
but
peter
did
need
to
see
how
was
dressed
in
order
to
recognize
him
peter
would
have
known
him
if
he
had
been
so
far
away
that
the
colors
of
his
coat
did
not
show
at
all
you
see
was
doing
a
most
surprising
thing
something
no
other
bird
can
do
he
was
walking
head
first
down
the
trunk
of
that
tree
picking
tiny
eggs
of
insects
from
the
bark
and
seemingly
quite
as
much
at
home
and
quite
as
unconcerned
in
that
queer
position
as
if
he
were
right
side
up
as
peter
approached
lifted
his
head
and
called
a
greeting
which
sounded
very
much
like
the
repetition
of
his
own
name
then
he
turned
around
and
began
to
climb
the
tree
as
easily
as
he
had
come
down
it
welcome
home
cried
peter
hurrying
up
quite
out
of
breath
turned
around
so
that
he
was
once
more
head
down
and
his
eyes
twinkled
as
he
looked
down
at
peter
you
mistaken
peter
said
he
this
is
home
i
simply
come
down
here
for
the
winter
you
know
home
is
where
you
raise
your
children
and
my
home
is
in
the
great
woods
farther
north
there
is
too
much
ice
and
snow
up
there
so
i
have
come
down
here
to
spend
the
well
anyway
it
a
kind
of
home
it
your
winter
home
protested
peter
and
i
certainly
am
glad
to
see
you
back
the
old
orchard
would
be
quite
the
same
without
you
did
you
have
a
pleasant
summer
and
if
you
please
tell
me
where
you
built
your
home
and
what
it
was
yes
mr
curiosity
i
had
a
very
pleasant
summer
replied
mrs
and
i
raised
a
family
of
six
and
that
is
doing
a
lot
better
than
some
folks
i
know
if
i
do
say
it
as
to
our
nest
it
was
made
of
leaves
and
feathers
and
it
was
in
a
hole
in
a
certain
old
stump
that
not
a
soul
knows
of
but
and
myself
now
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
yes
retorted
peter
promptly
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
can
walk
head
first
down
the
trunk
of
a
tree
without
losing
your
balance
and
tumbling
chuckled
happily
i
discovered
a
long
time
ago
peter
said
he
that
the
people
who
get
on
best
in
this
world
are
those
who
make
the
most
of
what
they
have
and
waste
no
time
wishing
they
could
have
what
other
people
have
i
suppose
you
have
noticed
that
all
the
woodpecker
family
have
stiff
tail
feathers
and
use
them
to
brace
themselves
when
they
are
climbing
a
tree
they
have
become
so
dependent
on
them
that
they
do
dare
move
about
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
without
using
them
if
they
want
to
come
down
a
tree
they
have
to
back
down
now
old
mother
nature
did
give
me
stiff
tail
feathers
but
she
gave
me
a
very
good
pair
of
feet
with
three
toes
in
front
and
one
behind
and
when
i
was
a
very
little
fellow
i
learned
to
make
the
most
of
those
feet
each
toe
has
a
sharp
claw
when
i
go
up
a
tree
the
three
front
claws
on
each
foot
hook
into
the
bark
when
i
come
down
a
tree
i
simply
twist
one
foot
around
so
that
i
can
use
the
claws
of
this
foot
to
keep
me
from
falling
it
is
just
as
easy
for
me
to
go
down
a
tree
as
it
is
to
go
up
and
i
can
go
right
around
the
trunk
just
as
easily
and
suiting
action
to
the
word
ran
around
the
trunk
of
the
just
above
peter
head
when
he
reappeared
peter
had
another
question
ready
do
you
live
altogether
on
grubs
and
worms
and
insects
and
their
eggs
he
asked
i
should
say
not
exclaimed
i
like
acorns
and
beechnuts
and
certain
kinds
of
i
do
see
how
such
a
little
fellow
as
you
can
eat
such
hard
things
as
acorns
and
beechnuts
protested
peter
a
little
doubtfully
laughed
right
out
sometime
when
i
see
you
over
in
the
green
forest
i
show
you
said
he
when
i
find
a
fat
beechnut
i
take
it
to
a
little
crack
in
a
tree
that
will
just
hold
it
then
with
this
stout
bill
of
mine
i
crack
the
shell
it
really
is
quite
easy
when
you
know
how
cracking
a
nut
open
that
way
is
sometimes
called
hatching
and
that
is
how
i
come
by
the
name
of
nuthatch
hello
there
i
have
seen
him
since
we
were
together
up
north
his
home
was
not
far
from
as
spoke
a
little
brown
bird
alighted
at
the
very
foot
of
the
next
tree
he
was
just
a
trifle
bigger
than
jenny
wren
but
not
at
all
like
jenny
for
while
jenny
tail
usually
is
cocked
up
in
the
sauciest
way
tail
is
never
cocked
up
at
all
in
fact
it
bends
down
for
uses
his
tail
just
as
the
members
of
the
woodpecker
family
use
theirs
he
was
dressed
in
above
and
beneath
across
each
wing
was
a
little
band
of
and
his
bill
was
curved
just
a
little
did
stop
an
instant
but
started
up
the
trunk
of
that
tree
going
round
and
round
it
as
he
climbed
and
picking
out
things
to
eat
from
under
the
bark
his
way
of
climbing
that
tree
was
very
like
creeping
and
peter
thought
to
himself
that
was
well
named
the
brown
creeper
he
knew
it
was
quite
useless
to
try
to
get
to
talk
he
knew
that
would
waste
any
time
that
way
round
and
round
up
the
trunk
of
the
tree
he
went
and
when
he
reached
the
top
at
once
flew
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
next
tree
and
without
a
pause
started
up
that
he
wasted
no
time
exploring
the
branches
but
stuck
to
the
trunk
once
in
a
while
he
would
cry
in
a
thin
little
voice
seep
seep
but
never
paused
to
rest
or
look
around
if
he
had
felt
that
on
him
alone
depended
the
job
of
getting
all
the
insect
eggs
and
grubs
on
those
trees
he
could
not
have
been
more
industrious
does
he
build
his
nest
in
a
hole
in
a
tree
asked
peter
of
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
he
hunts
for
a
tree
or
stub
with
a
piece
of
loose
bark
hanging
to
it
in
behind
this
he
tucks
his
nest
made
of
twigs
strips
of
bark
and
moss
he
a
funny
little
fellow
and
i
do
know
of
any
one
in
all
the
great
world
who
more
strictly
attends
to
his
own
business
than
does
the
brown
creeper
by
the
way
peter
have
you
seen
anything
of
dotty
the
tree
sparrow
not
yet
replied
peter
but
i
think
he
must
be
here
i
glad
you
reminded
me
of
him
i
go
look
for
chapter
xl
some
merry
having
been
reminded
of
dotty
the
tree
sparrow
peter
rabbit
became
possessed
of
a
great
desire
to
find
this
little
friend
of
the
cold
months
and
learn
how
he
had
fared
through
the
summer
he
was
at
a
loss
just
where
to
look
for
dotty
until
he
remembered
a
certain
weedy
field
along
the
edge
of
which
the
bushes
had
been
left
growing
perhaps
i
find
him
there
thought
peter
for
he
remembered
that
dotty
lives
almost
wholly
on
seeds
chiefly
weed
seeds
and
that
he
dearly
loves
a
weedy
field
with
bushes
not
far
distant
in
which
he
can
hide
so
peter
hurried
over
to
the
weedy
field
and
there
sure
enough
he
found
dotty
with
a
lot
of
his
friends
they
were
very
busy
getting
their
breakfast
some
were
clinging
to
the
picking
the
seeds
out
of
the
tops
while
others
were
picking
up
the
seeds
from
the
ground
it
was
cold
rough
brother
north
wind
was
doing
his
best
to
blow
up
another
it
was
at
all
the
kind
of
day
in
which
one
would
expect
to
find
anybody
in
high
spirits
but
dotty
was
he
was
even
singing
as
peter
came
up
and
all
about
dotty
friends
and
relatives
were
twittering
as
happily
and
merrily
as
if
it
were
the
beginning
of
spring
instead
of
winter
dotty
was
very
nearly
the
size
of
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
and
looked
somewhat
like
him
save
that
his
breast
was
clear
all
but
a
little
dark
spot
in
the
middle
the
little
dot
from
which
he
gets
his
name
he
wore
a
chestnut
cap
almost
exactly
like
that
of
chippy
the
chipping
sparrow
it
reminded
peter
that
dotty
is
often
called
the
winter
chippy
welcome
back
dotty
cried
peter
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
thank
you
peter
twittered
dotty
happily
in
a
way
it
is
good
to
be
back
certainly
it
is
good
to
know
that
an
old
friend
is
glad
to
see
are
you
going
to
stay
all
winter
dotty
asked
peter
i
hope
so
replied
dotty
i
certainly
shall
if
the
snow
does
not
get
so
deep
that
i
can
not
get
enough
to
eat
some
of
these
weeds
are
so
tall
that
it
will
take
a
lot
of
snow
to
cover
them
and
as
long
as
the
tops
are
above
the
snow
i
will
have
nothing
to
worry
about
you
know
a
lot
of
seeds
remain
in
these
tops
all
winter
but
if
the
snow
gets
deep
enough
to
cover
these
i
shall
have
to
move
along
farther
then
i
hope
there
wo
be
much
snow
declared
peter
very
emphatically
there
are
few
enough
folks
about
in
winter
at
best
goodness
knows
and
i
do
know
of
any
one
i
enjoy
having
for
a
neighbor
more
than
i
do
thank
you
again
peter
cried
dotty
and
please
let
me
return
the
compliment
i
like
cold
weather
i
like
winter
when
there
is
too
much
ice
and
bad
weather
i
always
feel
good
in
cold
weather
that
is
one
reason
i
go
north
to
speaking
of
nests
do
you
build
in
a
tree
inquired
peter
usually
on
or
near
the
ground
replied
dotty
you
know
i
am
really
a
ground
bird
although
i
am
called
a
tree
sparrow
most
of
us
sparrows
spend
our
time
on
or
near
the
i
know
replied
peter
do
you
know
i
very
fond
of
the
sparrow
family
i
just
love
your
cousin
chippy
who
nests
in
the
old
orchard
every
spring
i
wish
he
would
stay
all
winter
i
really
do
see
why
he
does
i
should
think
he
could
if
you
dotty
laughed
it
was
a
tinkling
little
laugh
good
to
hear
cousin
chippy
would
starve
to
death
he
declared
it
is
all
a
matter
of
food
you
ought
to
know
that
by
this
time
peter
cousin
chippy
lives
chiefly
on
worms
and
bugs
and
i
live
almost
wholly
on
seeds
and
that
is
what
makes
the
difference
cousin
chippy
must
go
where
he
can
get
plenty
to
eat
i
can
get
plenty
here
and
so
i
did
you
and
your
relatives
come
down
from
the
far
north
alone
asked
peter
no
replied
dotty
promptly
slaty
the
junco
and
his
relatives
came
along
with
us
and
we
had
a
very
merry
peter
pricked
up
his
ears
is
slaty
here
now
he
asked
eagerly
very
much
here
replied
a
voice
right
behind
peter
back
it
was
so
unexpected
that
it
made
peter
jump
he
turned
to
find
slaty
himself
chuckling
merrily
as
he
picked
up
seeds
he
was
very
nearly
the
same
size
as
dotty
but
trimmer
in
fact
he
was
one
of
the
trimmest
neatest
appearing
of
all
of
peter
friends
there
was
no
mistaking
slaty
the
junco
for
any
other
bird
his
head
throat
and
breast
were
clear
slate
color
underneath
he
was
white
his
sides
were
grayish
his
outer
tail
feathers
were
white
his
bill
was
flesh
color
it
looked
almost
white
welcome
welcome
cried
peter
are
you
here
to
stay
all
winter
i
certainly
am
was
slaty
prompt
response
it
will
take
pretty
bad
weather
to
drive
me
away
from
here
if
the
snow
gets
too
deep
i
just
go
up
to
farmer
brown
barnyard
i
can
always
pick
up
a
meal
there
for
farmer
brown
boy
is
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
i
know
he
wo
let
me
starve
no
matter
what
the
weather
is
i
think
it
is
going
to
snow
some
more
i
like
the
snow
you
know
i
am
sometimes
called
the
peter
nodded
so
i
have
heard
said
he
though
i
think
that
name
really
belongs
to
snowflake
the
snow
quite
right
peter
quite
right
replied
slaty
i
much
prefer
my
own
name
of
junco
my
these
seeds
are
good
all
the
time
he
was
busily
picking
up
seeds
so
tiny
that
peter
did
even
see
them
if
you
like
here
so
much
why
do
you
stay
all
the
year
inquired
peter
it
gets
too
warm
replied
slaty
promptly
i
hate
hot
weather
give
me
cold
weather
every
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
it
is
cold
all
summer
where
you
nest
in
the
far
north
demanded
peter
not
exactly
cold
replied
slaty
but
a
lot
cooler
than
it
is
down
here
i
do
go
as
far
north
to
nest
as
snowflake
does
but
i
go
far
enough
to
be
fairly
comfortable
i
do
see
how
some
folks
can
stand
hot
it
is
a
good
thing
they
can
interrupted
dotty
if
everybody
liked
the
same
things
it
would
do
at
all
just
suppose
all
the
birds
ate
nothing
but
seeds
there
would
be
seeds
enough
to
go
around
and
a
lot
of
us
would
starve
then
too
the
worms
and
the
bugs
would
eat
up
everything
so
take
it
all
together
it
is
a
mighty
good
thing
that
some
birds
live
almost
wholly
on
worms
and
bugs
and
such
things
leaving
the
seeds
to
the
rest
of
us
i
guess
old
mother
nature
knew
what
she
was
about
when
she
gave
us
different
peter
nodded
his
head
in
approval
you
can
always
trust
old
mother
nature
to
know
what
is
best
said
he
sagely
by
the
way
slaty
what
do
you
make
your
nest
of
and
where
do
you
put
it
my
nest
is
usually
made
of
grasses
moss
and
rootlets
sometimes
it
is
lined
with
fine
grasses
and
when
i
am
lucky
enough
to
find
them
i
use
long
hairs
often
i
put
my
nest
on
the
ground
and
never
very
far
above
it
i
am
like
my
friend
dotty
in
this
respect
it
always
seems
to
me
easier
to
hide
a
nest
on
the
ground
than
anywhere
else
there
is
nothing
like
having
a
nest
well
hidden
it
takes
sharp
eyes
to
find
my
nest
i
can
tell
you
that
peter
just
then
dotty
who
had
been
picking
seeds
out
of
the
top
of
a
weed
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
and
instantly
there
was
a
flit
of
many
wings
as
dotty
and
his
relatives
and
slaty
sought
the
shelter
of
the
bushes
along
the
edge
of
the
field
peter
sat
up
very
straight
and
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
at
first
he
saw
nothing
suspicious
then
crouching
flat
among
the
weeds
he
got
a
glimpse
of
black
pussy
the
cat
from
farmer
brown
house
she
had
been
creeping
up
in
the
hope
of
catching
one
of
those
happy
little
seedeaters
peter
stamped
angrily
then
with
long
jumps
he
started
for
the
dear
old
for
truth
to
tell
big
as
he
was
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
black
pussy
chapter

more
friends
come
with
the
snow
slaty
the
junco
had
been
quite
right
in
thinking
it
was
going
to
snow
some
more
rough
brother
north
find
hurried
up
one
big
cloud
after
another
and
late
that
afternoon
the
white
feathery
flakes
came
drifting
down
out
of
the
sky
peter
rabbit
sat
tight
in
the
dear
old
in
fact
peter
did
no
moving
about
that
night
but
remained
squatting
just
inside
the
entrance
to
an
old
hole
johnny
chuck
grandfather
had
dug
long
ago
in
the
middle
of
the
clear
old
some
time
before
morning
the
snow
stopped
falling
and
then
rough
brother
north
wind
worked
as
hard
to
blow
away
the
clouds
as
he
had
done
to
bring
them
when
jolly
round
bright
sun
began
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
he
looked
down
on
a
world
of
white
it
seemed
as
if
every
little
snowflake
twinkled
back
at
every
little
sunbeam
it
was
all
very
lovely
and
peter
rabbit
rejoiced
as
he
scampered
forth
in
quest
of
his
breakfast
he
started
first
for
the
weedy
field
where
the
day
before
he
had
found
dotty
the
tree
sparrow
and
slaty
the
junco
they
were
there
before
him
having
the
very
best
time
ever
was
as
they
picked
seeds
from
the
tops
of
the
weeds
which
showed
above
the
snow
almost
at
once
peter
discovered
that
they
were
not
the
only
seekers
for
seeds
walking
about
on
the
snow
and
quite
as
busy
seeking
seeds
as
were
dotty
and
slaty
was
a
bird
very
near
their
size
the
top
of
whose
head
neck
and
back
were
a
soft
there
was
some
black
on
his
wings
but
the
latter
were
mostly
white
and
the
outer
tail
feathers
were
white
his
breast
and
under
parts
were
white
it
was
snowflake
the
snow
bunting
in
his
winter
suit
peter
knew
him
instantly
there
was
no
mistaking
him
for
as
peter
well
knew
there
is
no
other
bird
of
his
size
and
shape
who
is
so
largely
white
he
had
appeared
so
unexpectedly
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
must
have
come
out
of
the
snow
clouds
just
as
had
the
snow
itself
peter
had
his
usual
question
ready
are
you
going
to
spend
the
winter
here
snowflake
he
cried
snowflake
was
so
busy
getting
his
breakfast
that
he
did
not
reply
at
once
peter
noticed
that
he
did
not
hop
but
walked
or
ran
presently
he
paused
long
enough
to
reply
to
peter
question
if
the
snow
has
come
to
stay
all
winter
perhaps
i
stay
said
he
what
has
the
snow
to
do
with
it
demanded
peter
only
that
i
like
the
snow
and
i
like
cold
weather
when
the
snow
begins
to
disappear
i
just
naturally
fly
back
farther
north
replied
snowflake
it
is
that
i
do
like
bare
ground
because
i
do
and
i
always
glad
when
the
snow
is
blown
off
in
places
so
that
i
can
hunt
for
seeds
on
the
ground
but
when
the
snow
begins
to
melt
everywhere
i
feel
uneasy
i
ca
understand
how
folks
can
be
contented
where
there
is
no
snow
and
ice
you
do
catch
me
going
down
south
no
siree
you
do
catch
me
going
down
south
why
when
the
nesting
season
comes
around
i
chase
jack
frost
clear
up
to
where
he
spends
the
summer
i
nest
up
on
the
shore
of
the
polar
sea
but
of
course
you
do
know
where
that
is
peter
if
you
are
so
fond
of
the
cold
in
the
far
north
the
snow
and
the
ice
what
did
you
come
south
at
all
for
why
do
you
stay
up
there
all
the
year
around
demanded
peter
because
peter
replied
snowflake
twittering
merrily
like
everybody
else
i
have
to
eat
in
order
to
live
when
you
see
me
down
here
you
may
know
that
the
snows
up
north
are
so
deep
that
they
have
covered
all
the
seeds
i
always
keep
a
weather
eye
out
as
the
saying
is
and
the
minute
it
looks
as
if
there
would
be
too
much
snow
for
me
to
get
a
living
i
move
along
i
hope
i
will
not
have
to
go
any
farther
than
this
but
if
some
morning
you
wake
up
and
find
the
snow
so
deep
that
all
the
heads
of
the
weeds
are
buried
do
expect
to
find
that
what
i
call
good
sound
common
sense
said
another
voice
and
a
bird
a
little
bigger
than
snowflake
and
who
at
first
glance
seemed
to
be
dressed
almost
wholly
in
soft
chocolate
brown
alighted
in
the
snow
close
by
and
at
once
began
to
run
about
in
search
of
seeds
it
was
wanderer
the
horned
lark
peter
hailed
him
joyously
for
there
was
something
of
mystery
about
wanderer
and
peter
as
you
know
loves
mystery
peter
had
known
him
ever
since
his
first
winter
yet
did
not
feel
really
acquainted
for
wanderer
seldom
stayed
long
enough
for
a
real
acquaintance
every
winter
he
would
come
sometimes
two
or
three
times
but
seldom
staying
more
than
a
few
days
at
a
time
quite
often
he
and
his
relatives
appeared
with
the
snowflakes
for
they
are
the
best
of
friends
and
travel
much
together
now
as
wanderer
reached
up
to
pick
seeds
from
a
peter
had
a
good
look
at
him
the
first
things
he
noticed
were
the
two
little
tufts
of
black
feathers
above
and
behind
the
eyes
it
is
from
these
that
wanderer
gets
the
name
of
horned
lark
no
other
bird
has
anything
quite
like
them
his
forehead
a
line
over
each
eye
and
his
throat
were
yellow
there
was
a
black
mark
from
each
corner
of
the
bill
curving
downward
just
below
the
eye
and
almost
joining
a
black
band
across
the
breast
beneath
this
he
was
soiled
white
with
dusky
spots
showing
here
and
there
his
back
was
brown
in
places
having
almost
a
pinkish
tinge
his
tail
was
black
showing
a
little
white
on
the
edges
when
he
flew
all
together
he
was
a
handsome
little
fellow
do
all
of
your
family
have
those
funny
little
horns
asked
peter
no
was
wanderer
prompt
reply
mrs
lark
does
not
have
i
think
they
are
very
becoming
said
peter
politely
thank
you
replied
wanderer
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
you
should
see
me
when
i
have
my
summer
is
it
so
very
different
from
this
asked
peter
i
think
your
present
suit
is
pretty
well
said
peter
well
said
interrupted
snowflake
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
think
wanderer
present
suit
is
pretty
enough
for
any
one
but
it
is
true
that
his
summer
suit
is
even
prettier
it
is
so
very
different
but
it
is
brighter
and
those
black
markings
are
much
stronger
and
show
up
better
you
see
wanderer
is
one
of
my
neighbors
in
the
far
north
and
i
know
all
about
and
that
means
that
you
do
know
anything
bad
about
me
does
it
chuckled
wanderer
snowflake
nodded
not
a
thing
he
replied
i
would
ask
for
a
better
neighbor
you
should
hear
him
sing
peter
he
sings
up
in
the
air
and
it
really
is
a
very
pretty
i
just
love
to
hear
him
replied
peter
why
do
you
sing
here
wanderer
this
is
the
singing
season
replied
wanderer
promptly
besides
there
is
time
to
sing
when
one
has
to
keep
busy
every
minute
in
order
to
get
enough
to
i
do
see
said
peter
why
when
you
get
here
you
do
stay
in
one
because
it
is
easier
to
get
a
good
living
by
moving
about
replied
wanderer
promptly
besides
i
like
to
visit
new
places
i
enjoy
being
tied
down
in
just
one
place
like
some
birds
i
know
would
you
snowflake
snowflake
promptly
replied
that
he
would
just
then
peter
discovered
something
that
he
had
known
before
my
goodness
he
exclaimed
what
a
long
claw
you
have
on
each
hind
toe
it
was
true
each
hind
claw
was
about
twice
as
long
as
any
other
claw
peter
could
see
any
special
use
for
it
and
he
was
just
about
to
ask
more
about
it
when
wanderer
suddenly
spied
a
flock
of
his
relatives
some
distance
away
and
flew
to
join
them
probably
this
saved
him
some
embarrassment
for
it
is
doubtful
if
he
himself
knew
why
old
mother
nature
had
given
him
such
long
hind
claws
chapter
xlii
peter
learns
something
about
spooky
peter
rabbit
likes
winter
at
least
he
does
mind
it
so
very
much
even
though
he
has
to
really
work
for
a
living
perhaps
it
is
a
good
thing
that
he
does
for
he
might
grow
too
fat
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
reddy
fox
you
see
when
the
snow
is
deep
peter
is
forced
to
eat
whatever
he
can
and
very
often
there
is
much
of
anything
for
him
but
the
bark
of
young
trees
it
is
at
such
times
that
peter
gets
into
mischief
for
there
is
no
bark
he
likes
better
than
that
of
young
fruit
trees
now
you
know
what
happens
when
the
bark
is
taken
off
all
the
way
around
the
trunk
of
a
tree
that
tree
dies
it
dies
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
is
up
the
inner
layer
of
bark
that
the
sap
travels
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
course
when
a
strip
of
bark
has
been
taken
off
all
the
way
around
near
the
base
of
a
tree
the
sap
can
not
go
up
and
the
tree
must
die
now
up
near
the
old
orchard
farmer
brown
had
set
out
a
young
orchard
peter
knew
all
about
that
young
orchard
for
he
had
visited
it
many
times
in
the
summer
then
there
had
been
plenty
of
sweet
clover
and
other
green
things
to
eat
and
peter
had
never
been
so
much
as
tempted
to
sample
the
bark
of
those
young
trees
but
now
things
were
very
different
and
it
was
very
seldom
that
peter
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
full
stomach
he
kept
thinking
of
that
young
orchard
he
knew
that
if
he
were
wise
he
would
keep
away
from
there
but
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
just
must
have
some
of
that
tender
young
bark
so
just
at
dusk
one
evening
peter
started
for
the
young
orchard
peter
got
there
in
safety
and
his
eyes
sparkled
as
he
hopped
over
to
the
nearest
young
tree
but
when
he
reached
it
peter
had
a
dreadful
disappointment
all
around
the
trunk
of
that
young
tree
was
wire
netting
peter
could
get
even
a
nibble
of
that
bark
he
tried
the
next
tree
with
no
better
result
then
he
hurried
on
from
tree
to
tree
always
with
the
same
result
you
see
farmer
brown
knew
all
about
liking
for
the
bark
of
young
fruit
trees
and
he
had
been
wise
enough
to
protect
his
young
orchard
at
last
peter
gave
up
and
hopped
over
to
the
old
orchard
as
he
passed
a
certain
big
tree
he
was
startled
by
a
voice
what
the
matter
peter
said
the
voice
you
do
look
peter
stopped
short
and
stared
up
in
the
big
look
as
he
would
he
could
see
anybody
of
course
there
was
a
leaf
on
that
tree
and
he
could
see
all
through
it
peter
blinked
and
felt
foolish
he
knew
that
had
there
been
any
one
sitting
on
any
one
of
those
branches
he
could
have
helped
seeing
him
do
look
so
high
peter
do
look
so
high
said
the
voice
with
a
chuckle
this
time
it
sounded
as
if
it
came
right
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
tree
peter
stared
at
the
trunk
and
then
suddenly
laughed
right
out
just
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
was
a
good
sized
hole
in
the
tree
and
poking
his
head
out
of
it
was
a
funny
little
fellow
with
big
eyes
and
a
hooked
beak
you
certainly
did
fool
me
that
time
spooky
cried
peter
i
ought
to
have
recognized
your
voice
but
i
spooky
the
screech
owl
for
that
is
who
it
was
came
out
of
the
hole
in
the
tree
and
without
a
sound
from
his
wings
flew
over
and
perched
just
above
peter
head
he
was
a
little
fellow
not
over
eight
inches
high
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
family
to
which
he
belonged
in
fact
he
looked
very
much
like
a
small
copy
of
hooty
the
great
horned
owl
so
much
so
that
peter
felt
a
little
cold
shiver
run
over
him
although
he
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
fear
from
spooky
his
head
seemed
to
be
almost
as
big
around
as
his
body
and
he
seemed
to
leave
no
neck
at
all
he
was
dressed
in
bright
with
little
streaks
and
bars
of
black
underneath
he
was
whitish
with
little
streaks
and
bars
of
black
and
brown
on
each
side
of
his
head
was
a
tuft
of
feathers
they
looked
like
ears
and
some
people
think
they
are
ears
which
is
a
mistake
his
eyes
were
round
and
yellow
with
a
fierce
hungry
look
in
them
his
bill
was
small
and
almost
hidden
among
the
feathers
of
his
face
but
it
was
hooked
just
like
the
bill
of
hooty
as
he
settled
himself
he
turned
his
head
around
until
he
could
look
squarely
behind
him
then
brought
it
back
again
so
quickly
that
to
peter
it
looked
as
if
it
had
gone
clear
around
you
see
spooky
eyes
are
fixed
in
their
sockets
and
he
can
not
move
them
from
side
to
side
he
has
to
turn
his
whole
head
in
order
to
see
to
one
side
or
the
other
you
have
told
me
yet
why
you
look
so
unhappy
peter
said
spooky
is
an
empty
stomach
enough
to
make
any
fellow
unhappy
retorted
peter
rather
shortly
spooky
chuckled
i
got
an
empty
stomach
myself
peter
said
he
but
it
is
making
me
unhappy
i
have
a
feeling
that
somewhere
there
is
a
fat
mouse
waiting
for
just
then
peter
remembered
what
jenny
wren
had
told
him
early
in
the
spring
of
how
spooky
the
screech
owl
lives
all
the
year
around
in
a
hollow
tree
and
curiosity
made
him
forget
for
the
time
being
that
he
was
hungry
did
you
live
in
that
hole
all
summer
spooky
he
asked
spooky
nodded
solemnly
i
lived
in
that
hollow
summer
and
winter
for
three
years
said
he
peter
eyes
opened
very
wide
and
till
now
i
never
even
guessed
it
he
exclaimed
did
you
raise
a
family
there
i
certainly
did
replied
spooky
mrs
spooky
and
i
raised
a
family
of
four
as
fine
looking
youngsters
as
you
ever
have
seen
they
gone
out
into
the
great
world
to
make
their
own
living
now
two
were
dressed
just
like
me
and
two
were
what
that
exclaimed
peter
i
said
that
two
were
dressed
just
like
me
and
two
were
gray
replied
spooky
rather
sharply
that
funny
peter
exclaimed
what
funny
snapped
spooky
rather
crossly
why
that
all
four
were
not
dressed
alike
said
peter
there
nothing
funny
about
it
retorted
spooky
and
snapped
his
bill
sharply
with
a
little
cracking
sound
we
screech
owls
believe
in
variety
some
of
us
are
gray
and
some
of
us
are
it
is
a
case
of
where
you
can
not
tell
a
person
just
by
the
color
of
his
peter
nodded
as
if
he
quite
understood
although
he
could
understand
at
all
i
ever
so
pleased
to
find
you
living
here
said
he
politely
you
see
in
winter
the
old
orchard
is
rather
a
lonely
place
i
see
how
you
get
enough
to
eat
when
there
are
so
few
birds
birds
snapped
spooky
what
have
birds
to
do
with
it
why
do
you
live
on
birds
asked
peter
innocently
i
should
say
not
i
guess
i
would
starve
if
i
depended
on
birds
for
my
daily
food
retorted
spooky
i
catch
a
sparrow
now
and
then
to
be
sure
but
usually
it
is
an
english
sparrow
and
i
consider
that
i
am
doing
the
old
orchard
a
good
turn
every
time
i
am
lucky
enough
to
catch
one
of
the
family
of
bully
the
english
sparrow
but
i
live
mostly
on
mice
and
shrews
in
winter
and
in
summer
i
eat
a
lot
of
grasshoppers
and
other
insects
if
it
was
for
me
and
my
relatives
i
guess
mice
would
soon
overrun
the
great
world
farmer
brown
ought
to
be
glad
i
come
to
live
in
the
old
orchard
and
i
guess
he
is
for
farmer
brown
boy
knows
all
about
this
house
of
mine
and
never
disturbs
me
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
think
i
fly
over
to
farmer
brown
young
orchard
i
ought
to
find
a
fat
mouse
or
two
trying
to
get
some
of
the
bark
from
those
young
huh
exclaimed
peter
they
can
try
all
they
want
to
but
they
get
any
i
can
tell
you
spooky
round
yellow
eyes
twinkled
it
must
be
you
have
been
trying
to
get
some
of
that
bark
yourself
said
he
peter
did
say
anything
but
he
looked
guilty
and
spooky
once
more
chuckled
as
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
so
soundlessly
that
he
seemed
more
like
a
drifting
shadow
than
a
bird
then
peter
started
for
a
certain
swamp
he
knew
of
where
he
would
be
sure
to
find
enough
bark
to
stay
his
appetite
chapter
xliii
queer
feet
and
a
queerer
bill
peter
rabbit
had
gone
over
to
the
green
forest
to
call
on
his
cousin
jumper
the
hare
who
lives
there
altogether
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
jumper
tracks
in
the
snow
and
by
following
these
he
at
length
came
up
with
jumper
the
fact
is
peter
almost
bumped
into
jumper
before
he
saw
him
for
jumper
was
wearing
a
coat
as
white
as
the
snow
itself
squatting
under
a
little
he
looked
like
nothing
more
than
a
little
mound
of
snow
oh
cried
peter
how
you
startled
me
i
wish
i
had
a
winter
coat
like
yours
it
must
be
a
great
help
in
avoiding
your
it
certainly
is
cousin
peter
cried
jumper
nine
times
out
of
ten
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
sit
perfectly
still
when
there
was
no
wind
to
carry
my
scent
i
have
had
reddy
fox
pass
within
a
few
feet
of
me
and
never
suspect
that
i
was
near
i
hope
this
snow
will
last
all
winter
it
is
only
when
there
is
any
snow
that
i
am
particularly
worried
then
i
am
not
easy
for
a
minute
because
my
white
coat
can
be
seen
a
long
distance
against
the
brown
of
the
dead
peter
chuckled
that
is
just
when
i
feel
safest
he
replied
i
like
the
snow
but
this
coat
of
mine
certainly
does
show
up
against
it
do
you
find
it
pretty
lonesome
over
here
in
the
green
forest
with
all
the
birds
gone
cousin
jumper
jumper
shook
his
head
not
all
have
gone
peter
you
know
said
he
strutter
the
grouse
and
grouse
are
here
and
i
see
them
every
day
they
got
snowshoes
peter
blinked
his
eyes
and
looked
rather
perplexed
snowshoes
he
exclaimed
i
do
understand
what
you
come
with
me
replied
jumper
and
i
show
so
jumper
led
the
way
and
peter
followed
close
at
his
heels
presently
they
came
to
some
tracks
in
the
snow
at
first
glance
they
reminded
peter
of
the
queer
tracks
farmer
brown
ducks
made
in
the
mud
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
in
summer
what
funny
tracks
those
are
he
exclaimed
who
made
them
just
keep
on
following
me
and
you
see
retorted
jumper
so
they
continued
to
follow
the
tracks
until
presently
just
ahead
of
them
they
saw
strutter
the
grouse
peter
opened
his
eyes
with
surprise
when
he
discovered
that
those
queer
tracks
were
made
by
strutter
cousin
peter
wants
to
see
your
snowshoes
strutter
said
jumper
as
they
came
up
with
him
strutter
bright
eyes
sparkled
he
just
as
curious
as
ever
he
said
he
well
i
do
mind
showing
him
my
snowshoes
because
i
think
myself
that
they
are
really
quite
he
held
up
one
foot
with
the
toes
spread
apart
and
peter
saw
that
growing
out
from
the
sides
of
each
toe
were
queer
little
horny
points
set
close
together
they
quite
filled
the
space
between
his
toes
peter
recalled
that
when
he
had
seen
strutter
in
the
summer
those
toes
had
been
smooth
and
that
his
tracks
on
soft
ground
had
shown
the
outline
of
each
toe
clearly
how
funny
exclaimed
peter
there
nothing
funny
about
them
retorted
strutter
if
old
mother
nature
had
given
me
something
of
this
kind
i
certainly
would
have
a
hard
time
of
it
when
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
if
my
feet
were
just
the
same
as
in
summer
i
would
sink
right
down
in
when
the
snow
is
soft
and
would
be
able
to
walk
about
at
all
now
with
these
snowshoes
i
get
along
very
nicely
you
see
i
sink
in
but
very
he
took
three
or
four
steps
and
peter
saw
right
away
how
very
useful
those
snowshoes
were
my
he
exclaimed
i
wish
old
mother
nature
would
give
me
snowshoes
strutter
and
jumper
both
laughed
and
after
a
second
peter
laughed
with
them
for
he
realized
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
him
to
have
anything
like
those
snowshoes
of
strutter
cousin
peter
was
just
saying
that
he
should
think
i
would
find
it
lonesome
over
here
in
the
green
forest
he
forgot
that
you
and
grouse
stay
all
winter
and
he
forgot
that
while
most
of
the
birds
who
spent
the
summer
here
have
left
there
are
others
who
come
down
from
the
far
north
to
take
their
who
for
instance
demanded
peter
snipper
the
crossbill
replied
jumper
promptly
i
have
seen
him
yet
this
winter
but
i
know
he
is
here
because
only
this
morning
i
found
some
pine
seeds
on
the
snow
under
a
certain
huh
peter
exclaimed
that
does
prove
anything
those
seeds
might
have
just
fallen
or
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
might
have
dropped
this
is
the
season
for
seeds
to
just
fall
and
i
know
by
the
signs
that
chatterer
has
been
about
retorted
jumper
let
go
over
there
now
and
see
what
we
will
once
more
he
led
the
way
and
peter
followed
as
they
drew
near
that
certain
a
short
whistled
note
caused
them
to
look
up
busily
at
work
on
a
pine
cone
near
the
top
of
a
tree
was
a
bird
about
the
size
of
bully
the
english
sparrow
he
was
dressed
wholly
in
dull
red
with
wings
and
tail
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
jumper
there
snipper
this
very
minute
and
over
in
that
next
tree
are
a
lot
of
his
family
and
relatives
see
in
what
a
funny
way
they
climb
about
among
the
branches
they
do
flit
or
hop
but
just
climb
around
i
do
know
of
any
other
bird
anywhere
around
here
that
does
just
then
a
seed
dropped
and
landed
on
the
snow
almost
in
front
of
peter
nose
almost
at
once
snipper
himself
followed
it
picking
it
up
and
eating
it
with
as
much
unconcern
as
if
peter
and
jumper
were
a
mile
away
instead
of
only
a
foot
or
so
the
very
first
thing
peter
noticed
was
snipper
bill
the
upper
and
lower
halves
crossed
at
the
tips
that
bill
looked
very
much
as
if
snipper
had
struck
something
hard
and
twisted
the
tips
over
have
have
you
met
with
an
accident
he
asked
a
bit
hesitatingly
snipper
looked
surprised
are
you
talking
to
me
he
asked
whatever
put
such
an
idea
into
your
head
your
bill
replied
peter
promptly
how
did
it
get
twisted
like
that
snipper
laughed
it
is
twisted
said
he
it
is
just
the
way
old
mother
nature
made
it
and
i
really
do
know
what
i
do
if
it
were
any
peter
scratched
one
long
ear
as
is
his
way
when
he
is
puzzled
i
see
said
he
how
it
is
possible
for
you
to
pick
up
food
with
a
bill
like
and
i
do
see
how
i
would
get
my
food
if
i
did
have
a
bill
like
this
retorted
snipper
then
seeing
how
puzzled
peter
really
was
he
went
on
to
explain
you
see
i
live
very
largely
on
the
seeds
that
grow
in
pine
cones
and
the
cones
of
other
trees
of
course
i
eat
some
other
food
such
as
seeds
and
buds
of
trees
but
what
i
love
best
of
all
are
the
seeds
that
grow
in
the
cones
of
evergreen
trees
if
you
ever
looked
at
one
of
those
cones
you
will
understand
that
those
seeds
are
not
very
easy
to
get
at
but
with
this
kind
of
a
bill
it
is
no
trouble
at
all
i
can
snip
them
out
just
as
easily
as
birds
with
straight
bills
can
pick
up
seeds
you
see
my
bill
is
very
much
like
a
pair
of
it
really
is
very
wonderful
confessed
peter
do
you
mind
telling
me
snipper
why
i
never
have
seen
you
here
in
summer
for
the
same
reason
that
in
summer
you
never
see
snowflake
and
wanderer
the
horned
lark
and
some
others
i
might
name
replied
snipper
give
me
the
far
north
every
time
i
would
stay
there
the
year
through
but
that
sometimes
food
gets
scarce
up
there
that
is
why
i
am
down
here
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
finish
my
snipper
flew
up
in
the
tree
where
the
other
crossbills
were
at
work
and
peter
and
jumper
watched
them
i
suppose
you
know
said
jumper
that
snipper
has
a
cousin
who
looks
almost
exactly
like
him
with
the
exception
of
two
white
bars
on
each
wing
he
is
called
the
i
did
know
it
replied
peter
but
i
glad
you
told
me
i
certainly
shall
watch
out
for
him
i
ca
get
over
those
funny
bills
no
one
could
ever
mistake
it
for
any
other
bird
is
there
anyone
else
now
from
the
far
north
whom
i
have
seen
chapter
xliv
more
folks
in
red
jumper
the
hare
did
have
time
to
reply
to
peter
rabbit
question
when
peter
asked
if
there
was
any
one
else
besides
the
crossbills
who
had
come
down
from
the
far
north
i
have
said
a
voice
from
a
tree
just
back
of
them
it
was
so
unexpected
that
it
made
both
peter
and
jumper
hop
in
startled
surprise
then
they
turned
to
see
who
had
spoken
there
sat
a
bird
just
a
little
smaller
than
welcome
robin
who
at
first
glance
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
however
a
closer
look
showed
that
there
were
markings
about
his
head
under
his
wings
and
on
his
legs
his
tail
was
brown
his
wings
were
brown
marked
with
black
and
white
and
slate
his
bill
was
thick
and
rather
short
who
are
you
demanded
peter
very
bluntly
and
impolitely
i
piny
the
pine
grosbeak
replied
the
stranger
seemingly
not
at
all
put
out
by
peter
bluntness
oh
said
peter
are
you
related
to
rosebreast
the
grosbeak
who
nested
last
summer
in
the
old
orchard
i
certainly
am
replied
piny
he
is
my
very
own
cousin
i
never
seen
him
because
he
never
ventures
up
where
i
live
and
i
do
go
down
where
he
spends
the
winter
but
all
members
of
the
grosbeak
family
are
rosebreast
is
very
lovely
and
i
very
fond
of
him
said
peter
we
are
very
good
then
i
know
we
are
going
to
be
good
friends
replied
piny
as
he
said
this
he
turned
and
peter
noticed
that
his
tail
was
distinctly
forked
instead
of
being
square
across
like
that
of
welcome
robin
piny
whistled
and
almost
at
once
he
was
joined
by
another
bird
who
in
shape
was
just
like
him
but
who
was
dressed
in
and
instead
of
the
bright
red
that
he
himself
wore
piny
introduced
the
newcomer
as
grosbeak
lovely
weather
is
it
said
she
i
love
the
snow
i
would
feel
at
home
with
no
snow
about
why
last
spring
i
even
built
my
nest
before
the
snow
was
gone
in
the
far
north
we
certainly
hated
to
leave
up
there
but
food
was
getting
so
scarce
that
we
had
to
we
have
just
arrived
can
you
tell
me
if
there
are
any
or
or
sumacs
near
here
peter
hastened
to
tell
her
just
where
she
would
find
these
trees
and
then
rather
timidly
asked
why
she
wanted
to
find
them
because
they
hold
their
berries
all
winter
replied
grosbeak
promptly
and
those
berries
make
very
good
eating
i
rather
thought
there
must
be
some
around
here
if
there
are
enough
of
them
we
certainly
shall
stay
a
i
hope
you
will
replied
peter
i
want
to
get
better
acquainted
with
you
you
know
if
it
were
not
for
you
folks
who
come
down
from
the
far
north
the
green
forest
would
be
rather
a
lonely
place
in
winter
there
are
times
when
i
like
to
be
alone
but
i
like
to
feel
that
there
is
someone
i
can
call
on
when
i
feel
lonesome
did
you
and
piny
come
down
alone
no
indeed
replied
grosbeak
there
is
a
flock
of
our
relatives
not
far
away
we
came
down
with
the
crossbills
all
together
we
made
quite
a
peter
and
jumper
stayed
a
while
to
gossip
with
the
grosbeaks
then
peter
bethought
him
that
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
return
to
the
dear
old
and
bidding
his
new
friends
he
started
off
through
the
green
forest
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
he
decided
to
run
over
to
the
weedy
field
to
see
if
the
snowflakes
and
the
tree
sparrows
and
the
horned
larks
were
there
they
were
but
almost
at
once
peter
discovered
that
they
had
company
twittering
cheerfully
as
he
busily
picked
seeds
out
of
the
top
of
a
weed
which
stood
above
the
snow
was
a
bird
very
little
bigger
than
chicoree
the
goldfinch
but
when
peter
looked
at
him
he
just
had
to
rub
his
eyes
gracious
goodness
he
muttered
it
must
be
something
is
wrong
with
my
eyes
so
that
i
am
seeing
red
i
already
seen
two
birds
dressed
in
red
and
now
there
another
it
certainly
must
be
my
eyes
there
dotty
the
tree
sparrow
over
there
i
hear
his
voice
i
wonder
if
he
will
look
peter
hopped
near
enough
to
get
a
good
look
at
dotty
and
found
him
dressed
just
as
he
should
be
that
relieved
peter
mind
his
eyes
were
quite
as
they
should
be
then
he
returned
to
look
at
the
happy
little
stranger
still
busily
picking
seeds
from
that
the
top
of
his
head
was
bright
red
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
his
back
was
toward
peter
at
the
time
and
but
for
that
bright
red
cap
peter
certainly
would
have
taken
him
for
one
of
his
friends
among
the
sparrow
family
you
see
his
back
was
peter
could
think
of
several
sparrows
with
backs
very
much
like
it
but
when
he
looked
closely
he
saw
that
just
above
his
tail
this
little
stranger
wore
a
pinkish
patch
and
that
was
something
no
sparrow
of
peter
acquaintance
possesses
then
the
lively
little
stranger
turned
to
face
peter
and
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
well
said
he
how
do
you
like
my
appearance
anything
wrong
with
me
i
was
taught
that
it
is
very
impolite
to
stare
at
any
one
i
guess
your
mother
forgot
to
teach
you
peter
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
said
but
continued
to
stare
my
how
pretty
you
are
he
exclaimed
the
little
stranger
was
pretty
his
breast
was
pink
below
this
he
was
white
the
middle
of
his
throat
was
black
and
his
sides
were
streaked
with
he
looked
pleased
at
peter
exclamation
i
glad
you
think
i
pretty
said
he
i
like
pink
myself
i
like
it
very
much
indeed
i
suppose
you
already
seen
my
friends
snipper
the
crossbill
and
piny
the
peter
promptly
bobbed
his
head
i
just
come
from
making
their
acquaintance
said
he
by
the
way
you
speak
i
presume
you
also
are
from
the
far
north
i
am
just
beginning
to
learn
that
there
are
more
folks
who
make
their
homes
in
the
far
north
than
i
had
dreamed
of
if
you
please
i
do
believe
i
know
you
at
i
redpoll
was
the
prompt
response
i
am
called
that
because
of
my
red
cap
yes
indeed
i
make
my
home
in
the
far
north
there
is
no
place
like
it
you
really
ought
to
run
up
there
and
get
acquainted
with
the
folks
who
make
their
homes
there
and
love
redpoll
laughed
at
his
own
joke
but
peter
did
see
the
joke
at
all
is
it
so
very
far
he
asked
innocently
then
added
i
dearly
love
to
redpoll
laughed
harder
than
ever
yes
said
he
it
is
i
am
afraid
you
would
be
a
very
old
and
very
gray
rabbit
by
the
time
you
got
there
i
guess
the
next
thing
is
for
you
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
us
who
get
down
here
once
in
redpoll
called
softly
and
almost
at
once
was
joined
by
another
bird
but
without
the
pink
breast
and
with
sides
more
heavily
streaked
this
is
redpoll
announced
her
lively
little
mate
then
he
turned
to
her
and
added
i
just
been
telling
peter
rabbit
that
as
long
as
he
can
not
visit
our
beautiful
far
north
he
must
become
acquainted
with
those
of
us
who
come
down
here
in
the
winter
i
sure
he
find
us
very
friendly
i
sure
i
shall
said
peter
if
you
please
do
you
live
altogether
on
these
weed
seeds
redpoll
laughed
his
usual
happy
laugh
hardly
peter
replied
he
we
like
the
seeds
of
the
birches
and
the
alders
and
we
eat
the
seeds
of
the
evergreen
trees
when
we
get
them
sometimes
we
find
them
in
cones
snipper
the
crossbill
has
opened
but
has
picked
all
the
seeds
out
of
sometimes
he
drops
some
for
us
oh
we
always
manage
to
get
plenty
to
eat
there
are
some
of
our
relatives
over
there
and
we
must
join
them
we
see
you
again
peter
said
he
hoped
they
would
and
then
watched
them
fly
over
to
join
their
friends
suddenly
as
if
a
signal
had
been
given
all
spread
their
wings
at
the
same
instant
and
flew
up
in
a
not
far
away
all
seemed
to
take
wing
at
precisely
the
same
instant
up
in
the
they
sat
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
just
as
if
another
signal
had
been
given
all
began
to
pick
out
the
tiny
seeds
from
the
birch
tassels
no
one
bird
seemed
to
be
first
it
was
quite
like
a
drill
or
as
if
each
had
thought
of
the
same
thing
at
the
same
instant
peter
chuckled
over
it
all
the
way
home
and
somehow
he
felt
better
for
having
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
redpolls
it
was
the
feeling
that
everybody
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
them
on
a
gold
winter
day
is
sure
to
have
chapter
xlv
peter
sees
two
terrible
feathered
hunters
while
it
is
true
that
peter
rabbit
likes
winter
it
is
also
true
that
life
is
anything
but
easy
for
him
that
season
in
the
first
place
he
has
to
travel
about
a
great
deal
to
get
sufficient
food
and
that
means
that
he
must
run
more
risks
there
is
a
minute
of
day
or
night
that
he
is
outside
of
the
dear
old
when
he
can
afford
not
to
watch
and
listen
for
danger
you
see
at
this
season
of
the
year
reddy
fox
often
finds
it
difficult
to
get
a
good
meal
he
is
hungry
most
of
the
time
and
he
is
forever
hunting
for
peter
rabbit
with
snow
on
the
ground
and
no
leaves
on
the
bushes
and
young
trees
it
is
not
easy
for
peter
to
hide
so
as
he
travels
about
the
thought
of
reddy
fox
is
always
in
his
mind
but
there
are
others
whom
peter
fears
even
more
and
these
wear
feathers
instead
of
fur
coats
one
of
these
is
terror
the
goshawk
peter
is
not
alone
in
his
fear
of
terror
there
is
not
one
among
his
feathered
friends
who
will
not
shiver
at
the
mention
of
terror
name
peter
will
not
soon
forget
the
day
he
discovered
that
terror
had
come
down
from
the
far
north
and
was
likely
to
stay
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
peter
went
hungry
all
the
rest
of
that
day
you
see
it
was
this
way
peter
had
gone
over
to
the
green
forest
very
early
that
morning
in
the
hope
of
getting
breakfast
in
a
certain
swamp
he
was
hopping
along
with
his
thoughts
chiefly
on
that
breakfast
he
hoped
to
get
but
at
the
same
time
with
ears
and
eyes
alert
for
possible
danger
when
a
strange
feeling
swept
over
him
it
was
a
feeling
that
great
danger
was
very
near
though
he
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
to
indicate
it
it
was
just
a
feeling
that
was
all
now
peter
has
learned
that
the
wise
thing
to
do
when
one
has
such
a
feeling
as
that
is
to
seek
safety
first
and
investigate
afterwards
at
the
instant
he
felt
that
strange
feeling
of
fear
he
was
passing
a
certain
big
hollow
log
without
really
knowing
why
he
did
it
because
you
know
he
did
stop
to
do
any
thinking
he
dived
into
that
hollow
log
and
even
as
he
did
so
there
was
the
sharp
swish
of
great
wings
terror
the
goshawk
had
missed
catching
peter
by
the
fraction
of
a
second
with
his
heart
thumping
as
if
it
were
trying
to
pound
its
way
through
his
ribs
peter
peeped
out
of
that
hollow
log
terror
had
alighted
on
a
tall
stump
only
a
few
feet
away
to
peter
in
his
fright
he
seemed
the
biggest
bird
he
ever
had
seen
of
course
he
was
actually
he
was
very
near
the
same
size
as
redtail
the
hawk
whom
peter
knew
well
he
was
handsome
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
he
was
handsome
his
back
was
bluish
his
head
seemed
almost
black
over
and
behind
each
eye
was
a
white
line
underneath
he
was
beautifully
marked
with
wavy
bars
of
gray
and
white
on
his
tail
were
four
dark
bands
yes
he
was
handsome
but
peter
had
no
thought
for
his
beauty
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
fierceness
of
the
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
the
entrance
to
that
hollow
log
peter
shivered
as
if
with
a
cold
chill
he
knew
that
in
terror
was
no
pity
or
gentleness
i
hope
thought
peter
that
and
grouse
are
nowhere
you
see
he
knew
that
there
is
no
one
that
terror
would
rather
catch
than
a
member
of
the
grouse
family
terror
did
not
sit
on
that
stump
long
he
knew
that
peter
was
not
likely
to
come
out
in
a
hurry
presently
he
flew
away
and
peter
suspected
from
the
direction
in
which
he
was
headed
that
terror
was
going
over
to
visit
farmer
brown
henyard
of
all
the
members
of
the
hawk
family
there
is
none
more
bold
than
terror
the
goshawk
he
would
not
hesitate
to
seize
a
hen
from
almost
beneath
farmer
brown
nose
he
is
well
named
for
the
mere
suspicion
that
he
is
anywhere
about
strikes
terror
to
the
heart
of
all
the
furred
and
feathered
folks
he
is
so
swift
of
wing
that
few
can
escape
him
and
he
has
no
pity
but
kills
for
the
mere
love
of
killing
in
this
respect
he
is
like
shadow
the
weasel
to
kill
for
food
is
forgiven
by
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
but
to
kill
needlessly
is
unpardonable
this
is
why
terror
the
goshawk
is
universally
hated
and
has
not
a
single
friend
all
that
day
peter
remained
hidden
in
that
hollow
log
he
did
not
dare
put
foot
outside
until
the
black
shadows
began
to
creep
through
the
green
forest
then
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
from
terror
the
goshawk
for
he
hunts
only
by
day
once
more
peter
thoughts
were
chiefly
of
his
stomach
for
it
was
very
very
empty
but
it
was
not
intended
that
peter
should
fill
his
stomach
at
once
he
had
gone
but
a
little
way
when
from
just
ahead
of
him
the
silence
of
the
early
evening
was
broken
by
a
terrifying
sound
it
was
so
sudden
and
there
was
in
it
such
a
note
of
fierceness
that
peter
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
jumping
and
running
for
dear
life
but
he
knew
that
voice
and
he
knew
too
that
safety
lay
in
keeping
perfectly
still
so
with
his
heart
thumping
madly
as
when
he
had
escaped
from
terror
that
morning
peter
sat
as
still
as
if
he
could
not
move
it
was
the
hunting
call
of
hooty
the
great
horned
owl
and
it
had
been
intended
to
frighten
some
one
into
jumping
and
running
or
at
least
into
moving
ever
so
little
peter
knew
all
about
that
trick
of
hooty
he
knew
that
in
all
the
green
forest
there
are
no
ears
so
wonderful
as
those
of
hooty
the
owl
and
that
the
instant
he
had
uttered
that
fierce
hunting
call
he
had
strained
those
wonderful
ears
to
catch
the
faintest
sound
which
some
startled
little
sleeper
of
the
night
might
make
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
would
be
enough
to
bring
hooty
to
the
spot
on
his
great
silent
wings
and
then
his
fierce
yellow
eyes
which
are
made
for
seeing
in
the
dusk
would
find
the
victim
so
peter
sat
still
fearful
that
the
very
thumping
of
his
heart
might
reach
those
wonderful
ears
again
that
terrible
hunting
cry
rang
out
and
again
peter
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
jumping
but
he
jump
and
a
few
minutes
later
as
he
sat
staring
at
a
certain
tall
dead
stub
of
a
tree
wondering
just
where
hooty
was
the
top
of
that
stub
seemed
to
break
off
and
a
great
bird
flew
away
soundlessly
like
a
drifting
shadow
it
was
hooty
himself
sitting
perfectly
straight
on
the
top
of
that
tall
dead
stub
he
had
seemed
a
part
of
it
peter
waited
some
time
before
he
ventured
to
move
finally
he
heard
hooty
hunting
call
in
a
distant
part
of
the
green
forest
and
knew
that
it
was
safe
for
him
to
once
more
think
of
his
empty
stomach
later
in
the
winter
while
the
snow
still
lay
in
the
green
forest
and
the
ice
still
bound
the
laughing
brook
peter
made
a
surprising
discovery
he
was
over
in
a
certain
lonely
part
of
the
green
forest
when
he
happened
to
remember
that
near
there
was
an
old
nest
which
had
once
belonged
to
redtail
the
hawk
out
of
idle
curiosity
peter
ran
over
for
a
look
at
that
old
nest
imagine
how
surprised
he
was
when
just
as
he
came
within
sight
of
it
he
saw
a
great
bird
just
settling
down
on
it
peter
heart
jumped
right
up
in
his
throat
at
least
that
is
the
way
it
seemed
for
he
recognized
hooty
of
course
peter
stopped
right
where
he
was
and
took
the
greatest
care
not
to
move
or
make
a
sound
presently
hooty
himself
appeared
and
perched
in
a
tree
near
at
hand
peter
has
seen
hooty
many
times
before
but
always
as
a
great
drifting
shadow
in
the
moonlight
now
he
could
see
him
clearly
as
he
sat
bolt
upright
he
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
height
as
terror
the
goshawk
but
with
a
very
much
bigger
body
if
peter
had
but
known
it
his
appearance
of
great
size
was
largely
due
to
the
fluffy
feathers
in
which
hooty
was
clothed
like
his
small
cousin
spooky
the
screech
owl
hooty
seemed
to
have
no
neck
at
all
he
looked
as
if
his
great
head
was
set
directly
on
his
shoulders
from
each
side
of
his
head
two
great
tufts
of
feathers
stood
out
like
ears
or
horns
his
bill
was
sharply
hooked
he
was
dressed
wholly
in
with
little
buff
and
black
markings
and
on
his
throat
was
a
white
patch
his
legs
were
feathered
and
so
were
his
feet
clear
to
the
great
claws
but
it
was
on
the
great
round
fierce
yellow
eyes
that
peter
kept
his
own
eyes
he
had
always
thought
of
hooty
as
being
able
to
see
only
in
the
dusk
of
evening
or
on
moonlight
nights
but
somehow
he
had
a
feeling
that
even
now
in
broad
daylight
hooty
could
see
perfectly
well
and
he
was
quite
right
for
a
long
time
peter
sat
there
without
moving
he
dared
not
do
anything
else
after
he
had
recovered
from
his
first
fright
he
began
to
wonder
what
hooty
and
hooty
were
doing
at
that
old
nest
his
curiosity
was
aroused
he
felt
that
he
simply
must
find
out
by
and
by
hooty
flew
away
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
hooty
peter
stole
back
the
way
he
had
come
when
he
was
far
enough
away
to
feel
reasonably
safe
he
scampered
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
that
place
and
he
wanted
to
find
some
one
of
whom
he
could
ask
questions
presently
he
met
his
cousin
jumper
the
hare
and
at
once
in
a
most
excited
manner
told
him
all
he
had
seen
jumper
listened
until
peter
was
through
if
you
take
my
advice
said
he
you
keep
away
from
that
part
of
the
green
forest
cousin
peter
from
what
you
tell
me
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
the
hooties
have
begun
nesting
exclaimed
peter
nesting
why
gentle
mistress
spring
will
not
get
here
for
a
month
yet
i
said
nesting
retorted
jumper
speaking
rather
crossly
for
you
see
he
did
not
like
to
have
his
word
doubted
hooty
the
great
horned
owl
does
wait
for
mistress
spring
he
and
hooty
believe
in
getting
household
cares
out
of
the
way
early
along
about
this
time
of
year
they
hunt
up
an
old
nest
of
redtail
the
hawk
or
blacky
the
crow
or
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
for
they
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
build
a
nest
themselves
then
hooty
lays
her
eggs
while
there
is
still
snow
and
ice
why
their
youngsters
do
catch
their
death
from
cold
when
they
hatch
out
is
more
than
i
can
say
but
they
do
i
sorry
to
hear
that
the
hooties
have
a
nest
here
this
year
it
means
a
bad
time
for
a
lot
of
little
folks
in
feathers
and
fur
i
certainly
shall
keep
away
in
from
that
part
of
the
green
forest
and
i
advise
you
peter
said
that
he
certainly
should
and
then
started
on
for
the
dear
old
to
think
things
over
the
discovery
that
already
the
nesting
season
of
a
new
year
had
begun
turned
peter
thoughts
towards
the
coming
of
sweet
mistress
spring
and
the
return
of
his
many
feathered
friends
who
had
left
for
the
south
so
long
before
a
great
longing
to
hear
the
voices
of
welcome
robin
and
winsome
bluebird
and
little
friend
the
song
sparrow
swept
over
him
and
a
still
greater
longing
for
a
bit
of
friendly
gossip
with
jenny
wren
in
the
past
year
he
had
learned
much
about
his
feathered
neighbors
but
there
were
still
many
things
he
wanted
to
know
things
which
only
jenny
wren
could
tell
him
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
find
out
that
no
one
knows
all
there
is
to
know
especially
about
the
birds
and
no
one
ever
will
