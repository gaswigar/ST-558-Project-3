this
ace
printing
april
printed
in
chapter
i
they
started
giving
me
the
business
as
soon
as
i
came
through
the
door
into
the
secretary
outer
office
there
was
ethel
the
secretary
receptionist
at
her
desk
there
was
courtlant
staynes
the
assistant
secretary
to
the
undersecretary
for
economic
penetration
and
norman
gazarin
from
protocol
and
toby
lawder
from
humanoid
peoples
affairs
and
raoul
chavier
and
hans
mannteufel
and
olga
reznik
it
was
a
wonder
there
were
more
of
them
watching
the
condemned
march
to
the
gibbet
the
word
that
the
secretary
had
called
me
in
must
have
gotten
all
over
the
department
since
the
offices
had
opened
ah
machiavelli
i
presume
ethel
kicked
off
machiavelli
junior
olga
picked
up
the
ball
at
least
that
the
way
he
signs
it
god
gift
to
the
consular
service
and
the
consular
service
gift
to
policy
planning
gazarin
added
take
it
easy
folks
these
hooligan
diplomats
would
as
soon
shoot
you
as
look
at
you
mannteufel
warned
be
sure
and
tell
the
secretary
that
your
friends
all
want
important
posts
in
the
galactic
empire
olga
again
well
i
glad
some
of
you
could
read
it
i
fired
back
maybe
even
a
few
of
you
understood
what
it
was
all
about
do
worry
silk
gazarin
told
me
secretary
ghopal
understands
what
it
was
all
about
all
too
well
you
find
a
buzzer
sounded
gently
on
ethel
desk
she
snatched
up
the
handphone
and
whispered
into
it
a
deathly
silence
filled
the
room
while
she
listened
whispered
some
more
then
hung
it
up
they
were
all
staring
at
me
secretary
ghopal
is
ready
to
see
stephen
silk
she
said
this
way
please
as
i
started
across
the
room
staynes
began
drumming
on
the
top
of
the
desk
with
his
fingers
the
slow
reiterated
rhythm
to
which
a
man
marches
to
a
military
execution
a
cigarette
lawder
inquired
tonelessly
a
glass
of
rum
there
were
three
men
in
the
secretary
of
state
private
office
ghopal
singh
the
secretary
slender
and
elegant
meeting
me
halfway
to
his
desk
another
slender
man
in
black
with
a
black
rudolf
klüng
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
aggression
and
a
huge
man
with
a
fat
and
opaque
black
eyes
when
i
saw
him
i
really
began
to
get
frightened
the
fat
man
was
natalenko
the
security
coördinator
good
morning
mister
silk
secretary
ghopal
greeted
me
his
hand
extended
gentlemen
stephen
silk
about
whom
we
were
speaking
this
way
mr
silk
if
you
please
there
was
a
low
at
the
rear
of
the
office
and
four
easy
chairs
around
it
on
the
round
brass
were
cups
and
saucers
a
coffee
urn
cigarettes
and
a
copy
of
the
current
issue
of
the
statesmen
open
at
an
article
entitled
future
courses
of
solar
league
by
somebody
who
had
signed
himself
machiavelli
jr
i
was
beginning
to
wish
that
the
pseudonymous
machiavelli
had
never
been
born
or
at
least
had
stayed
on
theta
virgo
iv
and
been
a
wineberry
planter
as
his
father
had
wanted
him
to
be
as
i
sat
down
and
accepted
a
cup
of
coffee
i
avoided
looking
at
the
periodical
they
were
probably
going
to
hang
it
around
my
neck
before
they
shoved
me
out
of
the
airlock
mr
silk
is
as
you
know
in
our
consular
service
ghopal
was
saying
to
the
others
back
on
luna
on
rotation
doing
something
in
halvord
section
he
is
the
gentleman
who
did
such
a
splendid
job
for
us
on
assha
gamma
norma
iii
and
as
he
has
just
demonstrated
he
added
gesturing
toward
the
on
the
table
he
is
a
student
both
of
the
diplomacy
of
the
past
and
the
implications
of
our
present
policies
a
bit
frank
klüng
commented
dubiously
but
judicious
natalenko
squeaked
in
the
high
eunuchoid
voice
that
came
so
incongruously
from
his
bulk
he
aired
his
singularly
accurate
predictions
in
a
periodical
that
does
have
a
circulation
of
more
than
a
thousand
copies
outside
his
own
department
and
i
do
think
the
public
semantic
reactions
to
the
terminology
of
imperialism
is
as
bad
as
you
imagine
they
seem
quite
satisfied
now
with
the
change
in
the
title
of
your
department
from
defense
to
aggression
well
we
gone
into
that
gentlemen
ghopal
said
if
the
article
really
makes
trouble
for
us
we
can
always
disavow
it
there
no
censorship
of
the
and
mr
silk
wo
be
around
to
draw
fire
on
us
it
i
thought
that
sounds
pretty
ominous
does
it
mr
silk
natalenko
tittered
happily
like
a
who
has
just
found
a
new
beetle
to
pull
the
legs
out
of
it
really
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
mr
silk
ghopal
hastened
to
reassure
me
we
are
going
to
have
to
banish
you
for
a
while
but
i
daresay
that
wo
be
so
bad
the
social
life
here
on
luna
has
probably
begun
to
pall
anyhow
so
we
sending
you
to
capella
iv
capella
iv
i
repeated
trying
to
remember
something
about
it
capella
was
a
like
sol
that
would
be
so
bad
new
texas
klüng
helped
me
out
god
no
i
thought
it
happens
that
we
need
somebody
of
your
sort
on
that
planet
mr
silk
ghopal
said
some
of
the
trouble
is
in
my
department
and
some
of
it
is
in
klüng
for
that
reason
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
coördinator
natalenko
explained
it
to
you
you
know
i
assume
our
chief
interest
in
new
texas
natalenko
asked
i
had
some
of
it
for
breakfast
sir
i
replied
supercow
natalenko
tittered
again
yes
new
texas
is
the
butcher
shop
of
the
galaxy
in
more
ways
than
one
i
afraid
you
find
they
just
butchered
one
of
our
people
there
a
short
while
ago
our
ambassador
in
fact
that
would
be
silas
cumshaw
and
this
was
the
first
i
heard
about
it
i
asked
when
it
had
happened
a
couple
of
months
ago
we
just
heard
about
it
last
evening
when
the
news
came
in
on
a
freighter
from
there
which
serves
to
point
up
something
you
stressed
in
your
article
the
difficulties
of
trying
to
run
a
centralized
democratic
government
on
a
galactic
scale
but
we
have
another
interest
which
may
be
even
more
urgent
than
our
need
for
new
texan
meat
you
heard
of
course
of
the
that
was
a
statement
not
a
question
natalenko
was
trying
to
insult
me
i
knew
who
the
were
i
run
into
them
here
and
there
one
of
the
intelligent
humanoid
races
who
seemed
to
have
been
evolved
from
canine
or
ancestors
instead
of
primates
most
of
them
could
speak
basic
english
but
i
never
saw
one
who
would
admit
to
understanding
more
of
our
language
than
the
basic
vocabulary
they
occupied
a
planets
in
a
small
about
forty
beyond
the
capella
system
they
had
developed
ships
before
we
came
into
contact
with
them
and
they
had
quickly
picked
up
the
from
us
back
in
those
days
when
the
solar
league
was
still
playing
missionaries
of
progress
and
trying
to
run
a
program
in
the
past
century
it
had
become
almost
impossible
for
anybody
to
get
into
their
although
ships
were
orbiting
in
on
every
planet
that
the
league
had
settled
or
controlled
there
were
traders
and
small
merchants
all
over
the
galaxy
and
you
almost
never
saw
one
of
them
without
a
camera
their
little
boats
were
everywhere
and
all
of
them
carried
more
of
the
most
modern
radar
and
astrogational
equipment
than
a
lifetime
earnings
would
pay
for
i
also
knew
that
they
were
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
ulcers
and
premature
gray
hair
at
the
league
capital
on
luna
i
done
a
little
reading
on
terran
history
i
had
been
impressed
by
the
parallel
between
the
present
situation
and
one
which
had
culminated
two
and
a
half
centuries
before
on
the
morning
of
december
what
natalenko
inquired
do
you
think
machiavelli
junior
would
do
about
the
we
have
a
department
of
aggression
i
replied
its
mottoes
are
trouble
before
it
starts
and
we
have
to
fight
let
do
it
on
the
other
fellow
real
estate
but
this
situation
is
just
a
little
too
delicate
for
literal
application
of
those
principles
an
unprovoked
attack
on
the
would
set
every
other
race
in
the
galaxy
against
us
would
an
attack
by
the
on
new
texas
constitute
just
provocation
it
might
new
texas
is
an
independent
planet
its
people
are
descendants
of
emigrants
from
terra
who
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
rule
of
the
solar
league
we
been
trying
for
half
a
century
to
persuade
the
new
texan
government
to
join
the
league
we
need
their
planet
for
both
strategic
and
commercial
reasons
with
the
for
neighbors
they
need
us
as
much
at
least
as
we
need
them
the
problem
is
to
make
them
understand
that
i
nodded
again
and
an
attack
by
the
would
do
that
too
sir
i
said
natalenko
tittered
again
you
see
gentlemen
our
mr
silk
picks
things
up
very
handily
does
he
he
turned
to
secretary
of
state
ghopal
you
take
it
from
there
he
invited
ghopal
singh
smiled
benignly
well
that
it
stephen
he
said
we
need
a
man
on
new
texas
who
can
get
things
done
three
things
to
be
exact
first
find
out
why
poor
cumshaw
was
murdered
and
what
can
be
done
about
it
to
maintain
our
prestige
without
alienating
the
new
texans
second
bring
the
government
and
people
of
new
texas
to
a
realization
that
they
need
the
solar
league
as
much
as
we
need
them
and
third
forestall
or
expose
the
plans
for
the
invasion
of
new
texas
that
all
now
i
thought
does
want
a
diplomat
he
wants
a
and
what
i
asked
will
my
official
position
be
on
new
texas
sir
or
will
i
have
one
of
any
sort
oh
yes
indeed
mr
silk
your
official
position
will
be
that
of
ambassador
plenipotentiary
and
envoy
extraordinary
that
i
believe
is
the
only
vacancy
which
exists
in
the
diplomatic
service
on
that
planet
at
dumbarton
oaks
diplomatic
academy
they
haze
the
freshmen
by
making
them
sit
on
a
stool
and
balance
a
teacup
and
saucer
on
one
knee
while
the
upper
classmen
pelt
them
with
balls
whoever
invented
that
and
the
other
similar
forms
of
hazing
was
one
of
the
great
geniuses
of
the
service
so
i
sipped
my
coffee
set
down
the
cup
took
a
puff
from
my
cigarette
then
said
i
am
indeed
deeply
honored
secretary
i
trust
i
need
go
into
any
assurances
that
i
will
do
everything
possible
to
justify
your
trust
in
me
i
believe
he
will
secretary
natalenko
piped
in
a
manner
that
chilled
my
blood
yes
i
believe
so
ghopal
singh
said
now
mr
ambassador
there
a
liner
in
orbit
two
thousand
miles
off
luna
which
has
been
held
from
blasting
off
for
the
last
eight
hours
waiting
for
you
do
bother
packing
more
than
a
few
things
you
can
get
everything
you
need
aboard
or
at
new
austin
the
planetary
capital
we
have
a
man
whom
coördinator
natalenko
has
secured
for
us
a
native
new
texan
hoddy
ringo
by
name
he
act
as
your
personal
secretary
he
aboard
the
ship
now
you
have
to
hurry
i
afraid
well
mr
ambassador
chapter
ii
the
outside
had
grown
to
about
fifteen
or
twenty
they
were
all
waiting
in
happy
anticipation
as
i
came
out
of
the
office
what
did
he
do
to
you
silk
courtlant
staynes
asked
amusedly
demoted
me
kicked
me
off
the
hooligan
diplomats
i
said
glumly
demoted
you
from
the
consular
service
staynes
asked
scornfully
impossible
yes
he
demoted
me
to
the
cookie
pushers
clear
down
to
ambassador
they
got
a
terrific
laugh
i
went
out
wondering
what
sort
of
noises
they
make
the
next
morning
when
the
appointments
sheet
was
posted
i
gathered
a
few
things
together
mostly
small
personal
items
and
all
the
microfilms
that
i
could
find
on
new
texas
then
got
aboard
the
space
navy
cutter
that
was
waiting
to
take
me
to
the
ship
it
was
a
trip
and
i
put
in
the
time
going
over
my
microfilm
library
and
using
a
stenophone
to
dictate
a
reading
list
for
the
spacetrip
as
i
rolled
up
the
i
wondered
what
sort
of
secretary
they
had
given
me
and
in
passing
why
natalenko
department
had
furnished
him
hoddy
ringo
queer
name
but
in
a
galactic
civilization
you
find
all
sorts
of
names
and
all
sorts
of
people
bearing
them
so
i
was
prepared
for
anything
and
i
found
it
i
found
him
standing
with
the
ship
captain
inside
the
airlock
when
i
boarded
the
big
spherical
a
tubby
little
man
with
shoulders
and
arms
he
had
never
developed
doing
secretarial
work
and
a
not
particularly
intelligent
face
the
happy
moron
he
does
give
a
i
thought
then
i
took
a
second
look
at
him
he
might
be
happy
but
he
was
a
moron
he
just
looked
like
one
natalenko
people
often
did
as
one
of
their
professional
assets
i
also
noticed
that
he
had
a
bulge
under
his
left
armpit
the
size
of
an
army
automatic
he
was
i
been
told
a
native
of
new
texas
i
gathered
after
talking
with
him
for
a
while
that
he
had
been
away
from
his
home
planet
for
over
five
years
was
glad
to
be
going
back
and
especially
glad
that
he
was
going
back
under
the
protection
of
solar
league
diplomatic
immunity
in
fact
i
rather
got
the
impression
that
without
such
protection
he
would
have
been
going
back
at
all
i
made
another
discovery
my
personal
secretary
it
seemed
read
stenotype
i
found
that
out
when
i
gave
him
the
tape
i
dictated
aboard
the
cutter
to
transcribe
for
me
gosh
boss
i
ca
make
anything
out
of
this
stuff
he
confessed
looking
at
the
combination
that
my
voice
had
put
onto
the
tape
well
then
put
it
in
a
player
and
transcribe
it
by
ear
i
told
him
he
did
seem
to
realize
that
that
could
be
done
how
did
you
come
to
be
sent
as
my
secretary
if
you
ca
do
secretarial
work
i
wanted
to
know
he
got
out
a
bag
of
tobacco
and
a
book
of
papers
and
began
rolling
a
cigarette
with
one
hand
why
shucks
boss
nobody
seemed
to
think
i
have
to
do
this
kinda
work
he
said
i
was
just
sent
along
to
show
you
the
way
around
new
texas
and
see
you
do
get
inta
no
trouble
he
got
his
handmade
cigarette
drawing
and
hitched
the
strap
that
went
across
his
back
and
looped
under
his
right
arm
a
guy
that
do
know
the
way
around
can
get
inta
a
lotta
trouble
on
new
texas
if
you
call
gettin
killed
trouble
so
he
was
a
bodyguard
and
i
wondered
what
else
he
was
one
thing
it
would
take
him
years
to
send
a
radio
message
back
to
luna
and
i
could
keep
track
of
any
other
messages
he
sent
in
letters
or
on
tape
by
ships
in
the
end
i
transcribed
my
own
tape
and
settled
down
to
laying
out
my
three
weeks
on
my
new
post
i
found
however
that
the
whole
thing
could
be
learned
in
a
few
hours
the
rest
of
what
i
had
was
duplication
some
of
it
contradictory
and
it
all
boiled
down
to
this
capella
iv
had
been
settled
during
the
first
wave
of
extrasolar
colonization
after
the
fourth
world
or
first
interplanetary
war
some
time
around
the
settlers
had
come
from
a
place
in
north
america
called
texas
one
of
the
old
united
states
they
had
a
lengthy
history
independent
republic
admission
to
the
united
states
secession
from
the
united
states
reconquest
by
the
united
states
and
general
intransigence
under
the
united
states
the
united
nations
and
the
solar
league
when
the
laws
of
physics
were
discovered
and
the
was
developed
practically
the
entire
population
of
texas
had
taken
to
space
to
find
a
new
home
and
independence
from
everybody
they
had
found
capella
iv
a
planet
with
a
slightly
higher
mean
temperature
a
lower
mass
and
lower
gravitational
field
about
water
and
at
a
stage
of
evolutionary
development
approximately
that
of
terra
during
the
late
pliocene
they
also
found
supercow
a
big
mammal
looking
like
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
a
hippopotamus
to
impersonate
a
dachshund
and
about
the
size
of
a
locomotive
on
new
texas
plains
there
were
billions
of
them
their
meat
was
fit
for
the
gods
of
olympus
so
new
texas
had
become
the
to
the
galaxy
there
was
very
little
in
any
of
the
about
the
politics
of
new
texas
and
such
as
it
was
it
was
very
scornful
there
were
such
expressions
as
tempered
by
assassination
and
parody
of
democracy
there
would
i
assumed
be
more
exact
information
in
the
material
which
had
been
shoved
into
my
hand
just
before
boarding
the
cutter
from
luna
in
a
package
labeled
secret
to
be
opened
only
in
space
after
the
first
there
was
also
a
big
trunk
that
had
been
placed
in
my
suite
sealed
and
bearing
the
same
instructions
i
got
hoddy
out
of
the
suite
as
soon
as
the
ship
had
passed
out
of
the
normal
continuum
locked
the
door
of
my
cabin
and
opened
the
parcel
it
contained
only
two
notebooks
both
labeled
with
the
solar
league
and
department
seals
both
adorned
with
the
customary
bloodthirsty
threats
against
the
unauthorized
and
the
indiscreet
they
were
numbered
and
contained
four
pages
on
the
first
i
read
message
of
the
first
solar
league
ambassador
to
new
texas
andrew
jackson
agree
with
none
of
the
information
about
this
planet
on
file
with
the
state
department
on
luna
the
people
of
new
texas
are
certainly
not
uncouth
barbarians
their
manners
and
customs
while
lively
and
unconventional
are
most
charming
their
dress
is
graceful
and
practical
not
grotesque
their
soft
speech
is
pleasing
to
the
ear
their
flag
is
the
original
flag
of
the
republic
of
texas
it
is
definitely
not
a
barbaric
travesty
of
our
own
emblem
and
the
underlying
premises
of
their
political
system
should
as
far
as
possible
be
incorporated
into
the
organization
of
the
solar
league
here
politics
is
an
exciting
and
exacting
game
in
which
only
the
true
representative
of
all
the
people
can
five
years
on
new
texas
andrew
jackson
hickock
resigned
married
a
daughter
of
a
local
rancher
and
became
a
naturalized
citizen
of
that
planet
he
is
still
active
in
politics
there
often
in
opposition
to
solar
league
that
did
sound
like
too
bad
an
advertisement
for
the
planet
i
was
even
feeling
cheerful
when
i
turned
to
the
next
page
and
message
of
the
second
solar
league
ambassador
to
new
texas
cyril
and
no
perhaps
and
perhaps
not
pardon
me
i
agree
with
everything
you
say
yes
and
no
perhaps
and
perhaps
not
pardon
me
i
agree
seven
years
on
new
texas
ambassador
godwinson
was
recalled
adjudged
hopelessly
and
then
message
of
the
third
solar
league
ambassador
to
new
texas
find
it
very
pleasant
to
inform
you
that
when
you
are
reading
this
i
will
be
suicide
after
six
months
on
new
i
turned
to
the
last
page
cautiously
found
message
of
the
fourth
solar
league
ambassador
to
new
texas
silas
came
to
this
planet
ten
years
ago
as
a
man
of
pronounced
and
outspoken
convictions
i
have
managed
to
keep
myself
alive
here
by
becoming
an
inoffensive
nonentity
if
i
continue
in
this
course
it
will
be
only
at
the
cost
of
my
beginning
tonight
i
am
going
to
state
and
maintain
positive
opinions
on
the
relation
between
this
planet
and
the
solar
at
the
home
of
andrew
hickcock
see
p
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
first
notebook
nice
cheerful
reading
complete
solid
briefing
i
was
frankly
almost
afraid
to
open
the
second
notebook
i
hefted
it
cautiously
at
first
saw
that
it
contained
only
about
as
many
pages
as
the
first
and
that
those
pages
were
sealed
with
a
band
around
them
i
took
a
quick
peek
read
the
words
on
the
band
reading
open
the
sealed
trunk
which
has
been
included
with
your
so
i
laid
aside
the
book
and
dragged
out
the
sealed
trunk
hesitated
then
opened
it
nothing
shocked
me
more
than
to
find
the
trunk
full
of
clothes
there
were
four
pairs
of
trousers
light
blue
dark
blue
gray
and
black
with
wide
cuffs
at
the
bottoms
there
were
six
or
eight
shirts
their
colors
running
the
entire
spectrum
in
the
most
violent
shades
there
were
a
couple
of
vests
there
were
two
pairs
of
short
boots
with
high
heels
and
fancy
and
a
couple
of
hats
with
brims
and
there
was
a
wide
leather
belt
practically
a
leather
corset
i
stared
at
the
belt
wondering
if
i
was
really
seeing
what
was
in
front
of
me
attached
to
the
belt
were
a
pair
of
pistols
in
and
holsters
the
pistols
were
ultraspeed
automatics
and
the
holsters
were
the
holsters
which
were
the
secret
of
the
state
department
special
services
must
be
a
i
thought
an
ambassador
now
and
ambassadors
never
carry
the
sanctity
of
an
ambassador
person
not
only
made
the
carrying
of
weapons
unnecessary
so
that
an
armed
ambassador
was
a
contradiction
of
diplomatic
terms
but
it
would
be
an
outrageous
insult
to
the
nation
to
which
he
had
been
accredited
like
taking
a
to
a
friendly
dinner
maybe
i
was
supposed
to
give
the
belt
and
the
holsters
to
hoddy
ringo
so
i
tore
the
sealed
band
off
the
second
notebook
and
read
through
it
i
was
to
wear
the
local
costume
on
new
texas
that
was
something
unusual
even
in
the
hooligan
diplomats
we
leaned
over
backward
in
wearing
terran
costume
to
distinguish
ourselves
from
the
people
among
whom
we
worked
i
was
further
advised
to
start
wearing
the
high
boots
immediately
on
shipboard
to
accustom
myself
to
the
heels
these
i
was
informed
were
traditional
they
had
served
a
useful
purpose
in
the
early
days
on
terran
texas
when
all
travel
had
been
on
horseback
on
horseless
and
mechanized
new
texas
they
were
a
useless
but
venerated
part
of
the
cultural
heritage
there
were
bits
of
advice
about
the
hat
and
the
trousers
which
for
some
obscure
reason
were
known
as
levis
and
i
was
informed
as
an
order
that
i
was
to
wear
the
belt
and
the
pistols
at
all
times
outside
the
embassy
itself
that
was
all
of
the
second
notebook
the
two
notebooks
plus
my
conversation
with
ghopal
klüng
and
natalenko
completed
my
briefing
for
my
new
post
i
slid
off
my
shoes
and
pulled
on
a
pair
of
boots
they
fitted
perfectly
evidently
i
had
been
tapped
for
this
job
as
soon
as
word
of
silas
cumshaw
death
had
reached
luna
and
there
must
have
been
some
fantastic
hurrying
to
get
my
outfit
ready
i
did
like
that
any
too
well
and
i
liked
the
order
to
carry
the
pistols
even
less
not
that
i
had
any
objection
to
carrying
weapons
i
had
been
born
and
raised
on
theta
virgo
iv
where
the
children
are
allowed
outside
the
house
unattended
until
learned
to
shoot
but
i
did
have
strenuous
objections
to
being
sent
virtually
ignorant
of
local
customs
on
a
mission
where
i
was
ordered
to
commit
deliberate
provocation
of
the
local
government
immediately
on
the
heels
of
my
predecessor
violent
death
the
author
of
future
courses
of
solar
league
had
recommended
the
use
of
provocation
to
justify
conquest
if
the
new
texans
murdered
two
solar
league
ambassadors
in
a
row
nobody
would
blame
the
league
for
moving
in
with
a
and
an
army
i
was
beginning
to
understand
how
doctor
guillotin
must
have
felt
while
his
neck
was
being
shoved
into
his
own
invention
i
looked
again
at
the
notebooks
each
marked
in
red
yourself
with
contents
and
burn
or
i
have
to
do
that
of
course
there
were
a
few
and
a
lot
of
people
aboard
this
ship
i
could
let
any
of
them
find
out
what
we
considered
a
full
briefing
for
a
new
ambassador
so
i
wrapped
them
in
the
original
package
and
went
down
to
the
lower
passenger
zone
where
i
found
the
ship
third
officer
i
told
him
that
i
had
some
secret
diplomatic
matter
to
be
destroyed
and
he
took
me
to
the
engine
room
i
shoved
the
package
into
one
of
the
convertors
and
watched
it
resolve
itself
into
its
constituent
protons
neutrons
and
electrons
on
the
way
back
i
stopped
in
at
the
ship
bar
hoddy
ringo
was
there
wrapped
up
in
and
i
use
the
words
literally
a
young
lady
from
the
alderbaran
system
she
was
on
her
way
home
from
one
of
the
quickie
divorce
courts
on
terra
and
was
celebrating
her
marital
emancipation
they
were
so
entangled
with
each
other
that
they
notice
me
when
they
left
the
bar
i
slipped
after
them
until
i
saw
them
enter
the
lady
stateroom
that
of
course
would
have
hoddy
immobilized
better
word
located
for
a
while
so
i
went
back
to
our
suite
picked
the
lock
of
hoddy
room
and
allowed
myself
half
an
hour
to
search
his
luggage
all
of
his
clothes
were
new
but
there
were
not
a
great
many
of
them
evidently
he
was
planning
to
himself
on
new
texas
there
were
a
few
odds
and
ends
the
kind
any
man
with
a
real
home
planet
will
hold
on
to
in
the
luggage
he
had
another
pistol
made
by
metalworks
mate
to
the
one
he
was
carrying
in
a
and
a
wide
belt
like
the
one
furnished
me
but
quite
old
i
greeted
the
sight
and
the
meaning
of
the
old
holsters
with
joy
they
were
the
state
department
special
services
type
that
meant
that
hoddy
was
just
one
of
natalenko
cutthroats
not
important
enough
to
be
issued
the
secret
equipment
but
i
was
a
little
worried
over
what
i
found
hidden
in
the
lining
of
one
of
his
bags
a
letter
addressed
to
lucius
stonehenge
aggression
department
attaché
new
austin
embassy
i
did
have
either
the
time
or
the
equipment
to
open
it
but
knowing
our
various
departments
i
tried
to
reassure
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
only
a
with
the
real
message
to
be
delivered
orally
about
the
real
message
i
had
no
doubts
the
murder
of
ambassador
stephen
silk
in
such
a
way
that
it
looks
like
another
new
texan
job
starting
that
evening
or
what
passed
for
evening
aboard
a
ship
in
hyperspace
hoddy
and
i
began
a
positively
epochal
binge
together
i
had
it
figured
this
way
as
long
as
we
were
on
board
ship
i
was
perfectly
safe
on
the
ship
in
fact
hoddy
would
definitely
have
given
his
life
to
save
mine
i
have
to
be
killed
on
new
texas
to
give
klüng
boys
their
excuse
for
moving
in
and
there
was
always
the
chance
with
no
chance
too
slender
for
me
to
ignore
that
i
might
be
able
to
get
hoddy
drunk
enough
to
talk
yet
still
be
sober
enough
myself
to
remember
what
he
said
exact
times
details
faces
names
came
to
me
through
a
sort
of
hazy
blur
as
hoddy
and
i
drank
something
he
called
superbourbon
a
new
texan
drink
that
bourbon
county
kentucky
would
never
have
recognized
they
had
no
corn
on
new
texas
this
stuff
was
made
out
of
something
called
superyams
there
were
at
least
two
things
i
got
out
of
the
binge
first
i
learned
to
slug
down
the
national
drink
without
batting
an
eye
second
i
learned
to
control
my
expression
as
i
uncovered
the
fact
that
everything
on
new
texas
was
supersomething
i
was
also
cautious
enough
before
we
really
got
started
to
leave
my
belt
and
guns
with
the
purser
i
did
want
hoddy
poking
around
those
secret
holsters
and
i
remember
telling
the
captain
to
radio
new
austin
as
soon
as
we
came
out
of
our
last
then
to
send
the
ship
doctor
around
to
give
me
my
hangover
treatments
but
the
one
thing
i
wanted
to
remember
as
the
hangover
shots
brought
me
back
to
normal
life
i
found
was
the
one
thing
i
could
remember
what
was
the
name
of
that
girl
a
big
beautiful
blond
who
joined
the
party
along
with
hoddy
grass
widow
from
alderbaran
and
stayed
with
it
to
the
end
damn
i
wished
i
could
remember
her
name
when
we
were
fifteen
thousand
miles
and
the
lighters
from
new
austin
spaceport
were
reported
on
the
way
i
got
into
the
levis
the
shirt
and
the
loose
vest
tucked
my
big
hat
under
my
arm
and
went
to
the
purser
office
for
my
guns
buckling
them
on
when
i
got
back
to
the
suite
hoddy
had
put
on
his
pistols
and
was
practicing
quick
draws
in
front
of
the
mirror
he
took
one
look
at
my
armament
and
groaned
you
gon
na
get
yourself
killed
for
sure
with
that
rig
an
them
popguns
he
told
me
these
popguns
shoot
harder
and
make
bigger
holes
than
that
pair
of
you
carrying
i
replied
an
them
holsters
hoddy
continued
why
it
take
all
day
to
get
your
guns
outa
them
you
better
let
me
find
you
a
real
rig
when
we
get
to
new
austin
there
was
a
chance
of
course
that
he
knew
what
i
was
using
and
wanted
to
hide
his
knowledge
i
doubted
that
sure
you
state
department
guys
always
know
everything
he
went
on
like
them
you
was
readin
i
try
to
tell
you
what
things
is
really
like
on
new
texas
an
you
let
it
go
in
one
ear
an
out
the
other
then
he
wandered
off
to
say
to
the
grass
widow
from
alderbaran
leaving
me
to
make
the
check
on
the
luggage
i
was
hoping
i
be
able
to
see
that
blond
what
her
name
gail
let
see
she
been
at
some
terran
university
and
she
was
on
her
way
home
to
to
new
texas
of
course
i
saw
her
half
an
hour
later
in
the
crowd
around
the
airlock
when
the
lighters
came
alongside
and
i
tried
to
push
my
way
toward
her
as
i
did
the
airlock
opened
the
crowd
surged
toward
it
and
she
was
carried
along
then
the
airlock
closed
after
she
had
passed
through
and
before
i
could
get
to
it
that
meant
i
have
to
wait
for
the
second
lighter
so
i
made
the
best
of
it
and
spent
the
next
watching
the
disc
of
the
planet
grow
into
a
huge
ball
that
filled
the
lower
half
of
the
viewscreen
and
then
lose
its
curvature
and
instead
of
moving
in
toward
the
planet
we
were
going
down
toward
it
chapter
iii
new
austin
spaceport
was
a
huge
place
a
good
fifty
miles
outside
the
city
as
we
descended
i
could
see
that
it
was
laid
out
like
a
wheel
with
the
landings
and
the
stands
around
the
hub
and
high
buildings
packing
houses
and
refrigeration
plants
along
the
many
spokes
it
showed
a
technological
level
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
accounts
i
had
read
or
the
stories
hoddy
had
told
about
the
simple
ranch
life
of
the
planet
might
be
foreign
capital
invested
there
and
i
made
a
mental
note
to
find
out
whose
on
the
other
hand
old
texas
on
terra
had
been
heavily
industrialized
so
much
so
that
the
state
itself
could
handle
the
gigantic
project
of
building
enough
spaceships
to
move
almost
the
whole
population
into
space
then
the
was
rushing
up
at
us
with
the
nearer
ends
of
the
roadways
and
streets
drawing
close
and
the
far
ends
lengthening
out
away
from
us
the
other
lighter
was
already
down
and
i
could
see
a
crowd
around
it
there
was
a
crowd
waiting
for
us
when
we
got
out
and
went
down
the
escalators
to
the
ground
and
as
i
had
expected
a
special
group
of
men
waiting
for
me
they
were
headed
by
a
tall
slender
individual
in
the
short
black
eisenhower
jacket
trousers
and
black
homburg
that
was
the
uniform
of
the
diplomatic
service
alias
the
cookie
pushers
over
their
heads
at
the
other
i
could
see
the
head
of
the
girl
i
met
on
the
ship
i
tried
to
push
through
the
crowd
and
get
to
her
as
i
did
the
cookie
pusher
got
in
my
way
mr
silk
mr
ambassador
here
we
are
he
was
clamoring
the
car
for
the
embassy
is
right
over
here
he
clutched
my
elbow
you
have
no
idea
how
glad
we
all
are
to
see
you
mr
ambassador
yes
yes
of
course
now
there
somebody
over
there
i
have
to
see
at
once
i
tried
to
pull
myself
loose
from
his
grasp
across
the
concrete
between
the
two
lighters
i
could
see
the
girl
push
out
of
the
crowd
around
her
and
wave
a
hand
to
me
i
tried
to
yell
to
her
but
just
then
another
lighter
loaded
with
freight
started
to
lift
out
at
another
nearby
stand
with
the
roar
of
half
a
dozen
niagaras
the
thin
man
in
the
striped
trousers
added
to
the
uproar
by
shouting
into
my
ear
and
pulling
at
me
we
have
time
he
finally
managed
to
make
himself
heard
dreadfully
late
now
sir
you
must
come
with
us
hoddy
too
had
caught
hold
of
me
by
the
other
arm
come
on
boss
there
got
ta
be
some
reason
why
he
got
himself
in
an
uproar
about
whatever
it
is
you
see
her
again
then
the
whole
gang
hoddy
the
thin
man
with
the
black
homburg
his
younger
accomplice
in
identical
garb
and
the
chauffeur
all
closed
in
on
me
and
pushed
me
pulled
me
me
fifty
yards
across
the
concrete
to
where
their
was
parked
by
this
time
the
tall
blond
had
gotten
clear
of
the
mob
around
her
and
was
waving
frantically
at
me
i
tried
to
wave
back
but
i
was
literally
crammed
into
the
car
and
flung
down
on
the
seat
at
the
same
time
the
chauffeur
was
jumping
in
extending
the
car
wings
jetting
up
great
god
i
bellowed
this
is
the
damnedest
piece
of
impudence
ever
had
to
suffer
from
any
subordinates
in
my
whole
state
department
experience
i
want
an
explanation
out
of
you
and
it
better
be
a
good
one
there
was
a
deafening
silence
in
the
car
for
a
moment
the
thin
man
moved
himself
off
my
lap
then
sat
there
looking
at
me
with
the
heartbroken
eyes
of
a
friendly
dog
that
had
just
been
kicked
for
something
which
was
really
its
fault
mr
ambassador
you
ca
imagine
how
sorry
we
all
are
but
if
we
had
gotten
you
away
from
the
spaceport
and
to
the
embassy
at
once
we
would
all
have
been
much
sorrier
somebody
here
gunnin
for
the
ambassador
hoddy
demanded
sharply
oh
no
i
had
even
thought
of
that
the
thin
man
almost
gibbered
but
your
presence
at
the
embassy
is
of
immediate
and
urgent
necessity
you
have
no
idea
of
the
state
into
which
things
have
gotten
oh
pardon
me
mr
ambassador
i
am
gilbert
thrombley
your
chargé
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
benito
gomez
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
i
shook
hands
with
him
too
and
started
to
introduce
hoddy
ringo
hoddy
however
had
turned
to
look
out
the
rear
window
immediately
he
gave
a
yelp
we
got
a
tail
boss
two
of
them
look
back
there
there
were
two
black
aircars
of
the
same
model
whizzing
after
us
making
an
obvious
effort
to
overtake
us
the
chauffeur
cursed
and
fired
his
auxiliary
jets
then
his
immediately
black
puffs
shot
away
from
the
pursuing
aircars
hoddy
turned
in
his
seat
cranked
open
a
in
the
window
and
poked
one
of
his
out
letting
the
whole
clip
go
thrombley
and
gomez
slid
down
onto
the
floor
and
both
began
trying
to
drag
me
down
with
them
imploring
me
not
to
expose
myself
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
was
nothing
to
expose
myself
to
the
other
cars
kept
coming
but
neither
of
them
were
firing
at
us
there
was
also
no
indication
that
hoddy
salvo
had
had
any
effect
on
them
our
chauffeur
went
into
a
perfect
frenzy
of
twisting
and
dodging
at
the
same
time
using
his
radiophone
to
tell
somebody
to
get
the
goddamn
gate
open
in
a
hurry
i
saw
the
blue
skies
and
green
plains
of
new
texas
replacing
one
another
above
under
in
front
of
and
behind
us
then
the
car
set
down
on
a
broad
stretch
of
concrete
the
wings
were
retracted
and
we
went
whizzing
down
a
city
street
we
whizzed
down
a
number
of
streets
we
cut
corners
on
two
wheels
and
on
one
wheel
and
i
was
prepared
to
swear
on
no
wheels
a
couple
of
times
with
the
wings
retracted
we
actually
jetted
into
the
air
and
jumped
over
vehicles
in
front
of
us
landing
again
with
jolts
then
we
made
an
abrupt
turn
and
shot
in
under
a
concrete
arch
and
a
big
door
banged
shut
behind
us
and
we
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
patio
the
front
of
the
car
a
few
inches
short
of
a
fountain
four
or
five
people
in
diplomatic
striped
trousers
local
dress
and
the
uniform
of
the
space
marines
came
running
over
thrombley
pulled
himself
erect
and
out
of
the
car
gomez
got
out
on
the
other
side
with
hoddy
i
climbed
out
after
thrombley
a
tall
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
space
navy
came
over
what
the
devil
the
matter
thrombley
he
demanded
then
seeing
me
he
gave
me
as
much
of
a
salute
as
a
naval
officer
will
ever
bestow
on
anybody
in
civilian
clothes
mr
silk
he
looked
at
my
costume
and
the
pistols
on
my
belt
in
concealment
of
surprise
i
your
military
attaché
stonehenge
space
navy
i
noticed
that
hoddy
ears
had
pricked
up
but
he
was
making
any
effort
to
attract
stonehenge
attention
i
shook
hands
with
him
introduced
hoddy
and
offered
my
cigarette
case
around
you
seem
to
have
had
a
hectic
trip
from
the
spaceport
mr
ambassador
what
happened
thrombley
began
accusing
our
driver
of
trying
to
murder
the
lot
of
us
hoddy
brushed
him
aside
and
explained
just
after
we
took
off
two
other
cars
took
off
after
us
we
speeded
up
and
they
speeded
up
too
then
your
here
got
fancy
that
shook
off
time
we
got
into
the
city
we
dropped
them
nice
job
of
driving
probably
saved
our
lives
shucks
that
was
nothin
the
driver
disclaimed
when
you
drive
for
politicians
you
either
good
or
you
good
and
dead
i
surprised
they
started
so
soon
stonehenge
said
then
he
looked
around
at
my
who
seemed
to
have
realized
by
now
that
they
were
no
longer
dangling
by
their
fingernails
over
the
brink
of
the
grave
but
gentlemen
let
not
keep
the
ambassador
standing
out
here
in
the
hot
sun
so
we
went
over
the
arches
at
the
side
of
the
patio
and
were
about
to
sit
down
when
one
of
the
embassy
servants
came
up
followed
by
a
man
in
a
loose
vest
and
blue
levis
and
a
big
hat
he
had
a
pair
of
automatics
in
his
belt
too
i
captain
nelson
new
texas
rangers
he
introduced
himself
which
one
of
is
stephen
silk
i
admitted
it
the
ranger
pushed
back
his
wide
hat
and
grinned
at
me
i
just
ca
figure
this
out
he
said
you
in
the
right
place
and
the
right
company
but
we
got
a
report
from
a
mighty
good
source
that
you
been
kidnapped
at
the
spaceport
by
a
gang
of
thugs
a
blond
source
i
made
curving
motions
with
my
hands
i
do
blame
her
my
efficient
and
conscientious
chargé
thrombley
felt
that
i
should
reach
the
embassy
here
as
soon
as
possible
and
from
where
she
was
standing
it
must
have
looked
like
a
kidnapping
fact
is
it
looked
like
one
from
where
i
was
standing
too
was
that
you
and
your
people
who
were
chasing
us
then
i
must
apologize
for
opening
fire
on
you
i
hope
nobody
was
hurt
no
our
cars
are
pretty
well
armored
you
scored
a
couple
of
times
on
one
of
them
but
no
harm
done
i
reckon
after
what
happened
to
silas
cumshaw
you
had
a
right
to
be
suspicious
i
noticed
that
refreshments
including
several
bottles
had
been
placed
on
a
big
wicker
table
under
the
arched
veranda
can
i
offer
you
a
drink
captain
in
token
of
mutual
amity
i
asked
well
now
i
like
to
mr
ambassador
but
i
on
duty
he
began
you
ca
be
you
an
officer
of
the
planetary
government
of
new
texas
and
in
this
embassy
you
in
the
territory
of
the
solar
league
that
right
now
mr
ambassador
he
grinned
extraterritoriality
wonderful
thing
extraterritoriality
he
looked
at
hoddy
who
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
met
him
was
trying
to
shrink
into
the
background
and
diplomatic
immunity
too
ai
it
hoddy
after
he
had
had
his
drink
and
departed
we
all
sat
down
thrombley
began
speaking
almost
at
once
mr
ambassador
you
must
you
simply
must
issue
a
public
statement
immediately
sir
only
a
public
statement
issued
promptly
will
relieve
the
crisis
into
which
we
have
all
been
thrust
oh
come
thrombley
i
objected
captain
nelson
take
care
of
all
that
in
his
report
to
his
superiors
thrombley
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
as
though
i
had
been
speaking
to
him
in
hottentot
then
waved
his
hands
in
polite
exasperation
oh
no
no
i
do
mean
that
sir
i
mean
a
public
statement
to
the
effect
that
you
have
assumed
full
responsibility
for
the
embassy
where
is
that
thing
mr
gomez
gomez
gave
him
four
or
five
sheets
stapled
together
he
laid
them
on
the
table
turned
to
the
last
sheet
and
whipped
out
a
pen
here
sir
just
sign
here
are
you
crazy
i
demanded
i
be
damned
if
i
sign
that
not
till
i
taken
an
inventory
of
the
physical
property
of
the
embassy
and
familiarized
myself
with
all
its
commitments
and
had
the
books
audited
by
some
firm
of
certified
public
accountants
thrombley
and
gomez
looked
at
one
another
they
both
groaned
but
we
must
have
a
statement
of
assumption
of
responsibility
gomez
dithered
or
the
business
of
the
embassy
will
be
at
a
dead
stop
and
we
do
anything
thrombley
finished
wait
a
moment
thrombley
stonehenge
cut
in
i
understand
mr
attitude
i
taken
command
of
a
good
many
ships
and
installations
at
one
time
or
another
and
i
never
signed
for
anything
i
could
see
and
feel
and
count
i
know
men
who
retired
as
brigadier
generals
or
but
they
retired
loaded
with
debts
incurred
because
as
second
lieutenants
or
ensigns
they
forgot
that
simple
rule
he
turned
to
me
without
any
disrespect
to
the
chargé
mr
silk
this
embassy
has
been
pretty
badly
disorganized
since
cumshaw
death
no
one
felt
authorized
or
to
put
it
more
accurately
no
one
dared
to
declare
himself
acting
head
of
the
embassy
because
that
would
make
him
the
next
target
i
interrupted
well
that
what
i
was
sent
here
for
gomez
as
secretary
of
the
embassy
will
you
please
at
once
prepare
a
statement
for
the
press
and
telecast
release
to
the
effect
that
i
am
now
the
authorized
head
of
this
embassy
responsible
from
this
hour
for
all
its
future
policies
and
all
its
present
commitments
insofar
as
they
obligate
the
government
of
the
solar
league
get
that
out
at
once
tomorrow
i
will
present
my
credentials
to
the
secretary
of
state
here
thereafter
thrombley
you
can
rest
in
the
assurance
that
i
be
the
one
they
be
shooting
at
but
you
ca
wait
that
long
mr
ambassador
thrombley
almost
wailed
we
must
go
immediately
to
the
statehouse
the
reception
for
you
is
already
going
on
i
looked
at
my
watch
which
had
been
regulated
aboard
ship
for
capella
iv
time
it
was
just
what
time
do
they
hold
diplomatic
receptions
on
this
planet
mr
thrombley
i
asked
oh
any
time
at
all
sir
this
one
started
about
when
the
news
that
the
ship
was
in
orbit
got
in
it
be
a
barbecue
of
course
and
barbecued
supercow
yipeee
hoddy
yelled
what
i
been
waitin
for
for
five
years
it
would
be
the
vilest
cruelty
not
to
take
him
along
i
thought
and
it
would
also
keep
him
and
stonehenge
apart
for
a
while
but
we
must
hurry
mr
ambassador
thrombley
was
saying
if
you
will
change
now
to
formal
dress
and
he
was
looking
at
me
gasping
i
think
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
actually
seen
what
i
was
wearing
in
native
dress
mr
ambassador
thrombley
eyes
and
tone
were
again
those
of
an
innocent
spaniel
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
marital
argument
then
his
gaze
fell
to
my
belt
and
his
eyes
became
saucers
oh
dear
and
armed
my
chargé
was
shuddering
and
he
could
not
look
directly
at
me
mr
ambassador
i
understand
that
you
were
recently
appointed
from
the
consular
service
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
if
i
point
out
here
in
private
that
thrombley
i
am
wearing
this
costume
and
these
pistols
on
the
direct
order
of
secretary
of
state
ghopal
singh
that
set
him
back
on
his
heels
i
i
ca
believe
it
he
exclaimed
an
ambassador
is
armed
not
when
he
dealing
with
a
government
which
respects
the
comity
of
nations
and
the
usages
of
diplomatic
practice
no
i
replied
but
the
fate
of
cumshaw
clearly
indicates
that
the
government
of
new
texas
is
not
such
a
government
these
pistols
are
in
the
nature
of
a
hint
of
the
manner
in
which
this
government
here
is
being
regarded
by
the
government
of
the
solar
league
i
turned
to
stonehenge
commander
what
sort
of
an
embassy
guard
have
we
i
asked
space
marines
sergeant
and
five
men
i
double
as
guard
officer
sir
very
well
thrombley
insists
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
go
to
this
or
whatever
it
is
immediately
i
want
two
men
a
driver
and
an
for
my
car
and
from
now
on
i
would
suggest
commander
that
you
wear
your
sidearm
at
all
times
outside
the
embassy
yes
sir
and
this
time
stonehenge
gave
me
a
real
salute
well
i
must
phone
the
statehouse
then
thrombley
said
we
will
have
to
call
on
secretary
of
state
palme
and
then
on
president
hutchinson
with
that
he
got
up
excused
himself
motioned
gomez
to
follow
and
hurried
away
i
got
up
too
and
motioned
stonehenge
aside
aboard
ship
coming
in
i
was
told
that
there
a
task
force
of
the
space
navy
on
maneuvers
about
five
from
here
i
said
yes
sir
task
force
fifth
space
fleet
fleet
admiral
sir
rodney
tregaskis
can
we
get
hold
of
a
fast
with
hyperdrive
engines
in
a
hurry
eight
or
ten
of
them
always
around
new
austin
spaceport
available
for
charter
all
right
charter
one
and
get
out
to
that
fleet
tell
admiral
tregaskis
that
the
ambassador
at
new
austin
feels
in
need
of
protection
possibility
of
invasion
i
give
you
written
orders
i
want
the
fleet
within
radio
call
how
far
out
would
that
be
with
our
facilities
the
embassy
radio
is
reliable
beyond
about
sixty
sir
then
tell
sir
rodney
to
bring
his
fleet
in
that
close
the
invasion
if
it
comes
will
probably
not
come
from
the
direction
of
the
they
probably
jump
past
us
and
move
in
from
the
other
side
i
hope
you
do
think
i
having
nightmares
commander
danger
of
a
invasion
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
persons
on
the
very
highest
level
on
luna
stonehenge
nodded
i
always
having
the
same
kind
of
nightmares
sir
especially
since
this
special
envoy
arrived
here
ostensibly
to
negotiate
a
treaty
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
we
want
the
new
texans
to
know
of
course
that
you
sent
for
the
fleet
naturally
not
well
if
i
can
wait
till
about
midnight
before
i
leave
i
can
get
a
boat
owned
manned
and
operated
by
solar
league
people
the
boat
a
old
tub
but
she
sound
and
fast
the
gang
who
own
her
are
pretty
notorious
characters
suspected
of
smuggling
piracy
and
what
not
but
they
keep
their
mouths
shut
if
well
paid
then
pay
them
well
i
said
and
it
just
as
well
you
not
leaving
at
once
when
i
get
back
from
this
clambake
i
want
to
have
a
general
informal
council
and
i
certainly
want
you
in
on
it
on
the
way
to
the
statehouse
in
the
aircar
i
kept
wondering
just
how
smart
i
had
been
i
was
pretty
sure
that
the
was
getting
ready
for
a
sneak
attack
on
new
texas
and
as
solar
league
ambassador
i
of
course
had
the
right
to
call
on
the
space
navy
for
any
amount
of
armed
protection
sending
stonehenge
off
on
what
could
be
less
than
an
trip
would
delay
anything
he
and
hoddy
might
be
cooking
up
too
on
the
other
hand
with
the
fleet
so
near
they
might
decide
to
have
me
rubbed
out
in
a
hurry
to
justify
seizing
the
planet
ahead
of
the
i
was
in
that
pleasant
spot
called
damned
if
you
do
and
damned
if
you
do
chapter
iv
the
statehouse
appeared
to
cover
about
a
square
mile
of
ground
and
it
was
an
insane
jumble
of
buildings
piled
beside
and
on
top
of
one
another
as
though
it
had
been
in
continuous
construction
ever
since
the
planet
was
colonized
years
before
at
what
looked
like
one
of
the
main
entrances
the
car
stopped
i
told
our
marine
driver
and
to
park
the
car
and
take
in
the
barbecue
but
to
leave
word
with
the
doorman
where
they
could
be
found
hoddy
thrombley
and
i
then
went
in
to
be
met
by
a
couple
of
new
texas
rangers
one
of
them
the
officer
who
had
called
at
the
embassy
they
guided
us
to
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
we
dreadfully
late
thrombley
was
fretting
i
do
hope
we
kept
the
secretary
waiting
too
long
from
the
looks
of
him
i
was
afraid
we
had
he
jumped
up
from
his
desk
and
hurried
across
the
room
as
soon
as
the
receptionist
opened
the
door
for
us
his
hand
extended
good
afternoon
thrombley
he
burbled
nervously
and
this
is
the
new
ambassador
i
suppose
and
this
he
caught
sight
of
hoddy
ringo
bringing
up
the
rear
and
stopped
short
hand
flying
to
open
mouth
oh
dear
me
so
far
i
had
been
building
myself
a
new
texas
stereotype
from
hoddy
ringo
and
the
ranger
officer
who
had
chased
us
to
the
embassy
but
this
frightened
little
rabbit
of
a
fellow
simply
did
fit
it
an
alien
would
be
justified
in
assigning
him
to
an
entirely
different
species
thrombley
introduced
me
i
introduced
hoddy
as
my
confidential
secretary
and
advisor
we
all
shook
hands
and
thrombley
dug
my
credentials
out
of
his
briefcase
and
handed
them
to
me
and
i
handed
them
to
the
secretary
of
state
william
palme
he
barely
glanced
at
them
then
shook
my
hand
again
fervently
and
mumbled
something
about
inexpressible
pleasure
and
entirely
acceptable
to
my
government
that
made
me
the
accredited
and
accepted
ambassador
to
new
texas
palme
hoped
or
said
he
hoped
that
my
stay
in
new
texas
would
be
long
and
pleasant
he
seemed
rather
less
than
convinced
that
it
would
be
his
eyes
kept
returning
in
horrified
fascination
to
my
belt
each
time
they
would
focus
on
the
butts
of
my
he
would
pull
them
resolutely
away
again
and
now
we
must
take
you
to
president
hutchinson
he
is
most
anxious
to
meet
you
mr
silk
if
you
will
please
come
with
me
four
or
five
rangers
who
had
been
loitering
the
hall
outside
moved
to
follow
us
as
we
went
toward
the
elevator
although
we
had
come
into
the
building
onto
a
floor
only
a
few
feet
above
we
went
down
three
floors
from
the
hallway
outside
the
secretary
of
state
office
into
a
huge
room
the
concrete
floor
of
which
was
as
though
vehicles
were
continually
being
driven
in
and
out
it
was
about
a
hundred
feet
wide
and
two
or
three
hundred
in
length
daylight
was
visible
through
open
doors
at
the
end
as
we
approached
them
the
rangers
fanning
out
on
either
side
and
in
front
of
us
i
could
hear
a
perfect
bedlam
of
noise
outside
shouting
singing
music
interspersed
with
the
banging
of
shots
when
we
reached
the
doors
at
the
end
we
emerged
into
one
end
of
a
big
rectangular
plaza
at
least
five
hundred
yards
in
length
most
of
the
uproar
was
centered
at
the
opposite
end
where
several
thousand
people
in
costumes
colored
through
the
whole
spectrum
were
milling
about
there
seemed
to
be
at
least
two
going
on
to
the
music
of
competing
bands
at
the
distant
end
of
the
plaza
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
i
could
see
the
piles
and
tracks
of
an
overhead
crane
towering
above
what
looked
like
an
furnace
between
us
and
the
bulk
of
the
crowd
in
a
cleared
space
two
medium
tanks
heavily
padded
with
mats
were
ramming
and
trying
to
overturn
each
other
the
mob
of
spectators
crowding
as
close
to
them
as
they
dared
the
din
was
positively
deafening
though
we
were
at
least
two
hundred
yards
from
the
center
of
the
crowd
oh
dear
i
always
dread
these
things
palme
was
saying
yes
absolutely
anything
could
happen
thrombley
twittered
man
this
is
a
real
barbecue
hoddy
gloated
now
i
really
feel
at
home
over
this
way
mr
silk
palme
said
guiding
me
toward
the
short
end
of
the
plaza
on
our
left
we
will
see
the
president
and
then
he
gulped
then
we
will
all
go
to
the
barbecue
in
the
center
of
the
short
end
of
the
plaza
dwarfed
by
the
monster
bulks
of
steel
and
concrete
and
glass
around
it
stood
a
little
old
building
of
adobe
i
had
never
seen
it
before
but
somehow
it
was
and
then
i
remembered
although
i
had
never
seen
it
before
i
had
seen
it
pictured
many
times
pictured
under
attack
with
gunsmoke
spouting
from
windows
and
parapets
i
plucked
thrombley
sleeve
is
that
a
replica
of
the
alamo
he
was
shocked
oh
dear
mr
ambassador
do
let
anybody
hear
you
ask
that
that
no
replica
it
the
alamo
alamo
i
stood
there
a
moment
looking
at
it
i
was
remembering
and
finally
understanding
what
my
lessons
about
the
romantic
freeze
had
meant
had
taken
this
little
down
brick
by
adobe
brick
loaded
it
carefully
into
a
spaceship
brought
it
here
forty
two
away
from
terra
and
reverently
set
it
up
again
then
they
had
built
a
whole
world
and
a
whole
social
philosophy
around
it
had
been
the
dissatisfied
of
course
the
discontented
the
dreamers
who
had
led
the
vanguard
of
man
explosion
into
space
following
the
discovery
of
the
they
had
gone
from
terra
cherishing
dreams
of
things
that
had
been
dumped
into
the
dust
bin
of
history
carrying
with
them
pictures
of
ways
of
life
that
had
passed
away
or
that
had
never
really
been
then
in
their
new
life
on
new
planets
they
had
set
to
work
making
those
dreams
and
those
pictures
live
and
many
times
they
had
come
close
to
succeeding
these
texans
now
they
had
left
behind
the
cold
fact
that
it
had
been
their
state
great
industrial
complex
that
had
made
their
migration
possible
they
ignored
the
fact
that
their
life
here
on
capella
iv
was
possible
only
by
application
of
modern
industrial
technology
that
rodeo
down
the
plaza
instead
of
here
they
were
living
frozen
in
a
romantic
dream
a
world
of
roving
cowboys
and
ranch
kingdoms
no
wonder
hoddy
had
liked
the
books
i
had
been
reading
on
the
ship
they
shook
the
fabric
of
that
dream
there
were
people
moving
about
at
this
relatively
quiet
end
of
the
plaza
mostly
in
the
direction
of
the
barbecue
ten
or
twelve
rangers
loitered
at
the
front
of
the
alamo
and
with
them
i
saw
the
dress
blues
of
my
two
marines
there
was
a
little
motorcart
among
them
from
which
they
were
helping
themselves
to
food
and
drink
when
they
saw
us
coming
the
two
marines
shoved
their
sandwiches
into
the
hands
of
a
couple
of
rangers
and
tried
to
come
to
attention
at
ease
at
ease
i
told
them
have
a
good
time
boys
hoddy
you
better
get
in
on
some
of
this
grub
i
may
be
inside
for
quite
a
while
as
soon
as
the
rangers
saw
hoddy
they
hastily
got
things
out
of
their
right
hands
hoddy
grinned
at
them
take
it
easy
boys
he
said
i
protected
by
the
game
laws
i
a
diplomat
i
am
there
were
a
couple
of
rangers
lounging
outside
the
door
of
the
president
office
and
both
of
them
carried
autorifles
implying
things
i
did
like
i
had
seen
the
president
of
the
solar
league
wandering
around
the
of
artemis
unattended
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
professor
in
his
academic
halls
since
then
maybe
before
then
i
had
always
had
a
healthy
suspicion
of
governments
whose
chiefs
had
to
surround
themselves
with
bodyguards
but
the
president
of
new
texas
john
hutchinson
was
alone
in
his
office
when
we
were
shown
in
he
got
up
and
came
around
his
desk
to
greet
us
a
slender
man
in
a
laced
jacket
he
had
a
narrow
compressed
mouth
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
watching
every
corner
of
the
room
at
once
he
wore
a
pair
of
small
pistols
in
holsters
under
his
coat
and
he
always
kept
one
hand
or
the
other
close
to
his
abdomen
he
was
like
and
yet
unlike
the
secretary
of
state
both
had
the
look
of
hunted
animals
but
where
palme
was
a
rabbit
twitching
to
take
flight
at
the
first
whiff
of
danger
hutchinson
was
a
cat
who
hears
hounds
baying
ready
to
run
if
he
could
or
claw
if
he
must
good
day
mr
silk
he
said
shaking
hands
with
me
after
the
introductions
i
see
you
heeled
you
smart
you
would
be
here
today
if
poor
silas
cumshaw
been
as
smart
as
you
are
great
man
though
a
wise
and
farseeing
statesman
he
and
i
were
real
friends
you
know
who
mr
silk
brought
with
him
as
bodyguard
palme
asked
hoddy
ringo
oh
my
god
i
thought
this
planet
was
rid
of
him
the
president
turned
to
me
you
got
a
good
though
mr
ambassador
good
man
to
watch
your
back
for
you
but
lot
of
folks
here
wo
thank
you
for
bringing
him
back
to
new
texas
he
looked
at
his
watch
we
have
time
for
a
little
drink
before
we
go
outside
mr
silk
he
said
care
to
join
me
i
assented
and
he
got
a
bottle
of
superbourbon
out
of
his
desk
with
four
glasses
palme
got
some
water
tumblers
and
brought
the
pitcher
of
from
the
cooler
i
noticed
that
the
new
texas
secretary
of
state
filled
his
liquor
glass
to
the
top
and
gulped
it
down
at
once
he
might
act
as
though
he
were
descended
from
a
long
line
of
maiden
aunts
but
he
took
his
liquor
in
blasts
that
would
have
floored
a
spaceport
we
had
another
drink
a
little
slower
and
chatted
for
a
while
and
then
hutchinson
said
regretfully
that
we
have
to
go
outside
and
meet
the
folks
outside
our
guards
hoddy
the
two
marines
the
rangers
who
had
escorted
us
from
palme
office
and
hutchinson
retinue
surrounded
us
and
we
made
our
way
down
the
plaza
through
the
crowd
the
din
yells
whistles
cowbells
pistol
shots
the
cacophony
of
the
two
and
the
of
which
i
caught
only
the
words
skies
of
freedom
are
above
you
was
as
bad
as
new
year
eve
in
manhattan
or
nairobi
or
new
moscow
on
terra
do
take
all
this
as
a
personal
tribute
mr
silk
hutchinson
screamed
into
my
ear
on
this
planet
to
paraphrase
nietzsche
a
good
barbecue
halloweth
any
cause
that
surprised
me
at
the
moment
later
i
found
out
that
john
hutchinson
was
one
of
the
leading
scholars
on
new
texas
and
had
once
been
president
of
one
of
their
universities
new
texas
christian
i
believe
as
we
got
up
onto
the
platform
close
enough
to
the
barbecue
pits
to
feel
the
heat
from
them
somebody
let
off
what
sounded
like
a
gun
five
or
six
times
hutchinson
grabbed
a
microphone
and
bellowed
into
it
ladies
and
gentlemen
your
attention
please
the
noise
began
to
diminish
slowly
until
i
could
hear
one
voice
in
the
crowd
below
shut
up
you
damn
fools
we
ca
eat
till
this
is
over
hutchinson
introduced
me
in
very
few
words
i
gathered
that
lengthy
speeches
at
barbecues
were
not
popular
on
new
texas
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
yelled
into
the
microphone
appreciative
as
i
am
of
this
honor
there
is
one
here
who
is
more
deserving
of
your
notice
than
i
one
to
whom
i
also
pay
homage
he
over
there
on
the
fire
and
i
want
a
slice
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
that
got
a
big
ovation
there
was
beside
the
water
pitcher
a
bottle
of
superbourbon
i
ostentatiously
threw
the
water
out
of
the
glass
poured
a
big
shot
of
the
corrosive
stuff
and
downed
it
for
god
sake
let
eat
i
finished
then
i
turned
to
thrombley
who
was
looking
like
a
priest
who
has
just
seen
the
bishop
spit
in
the
font
stick
close
to
me
i
whispered
cue
me
in
on
the
local
notables
and
the
other
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
then
we
all
got
down
off
the
platform
and
a
band
climbed
up
and
began
playing
one
of
those
raucous
cowboy
ballads
which
had
originated
in
manhattan
about
the
middle
of
the
twentieth
century
the
sandwiches
be
here
in
a
moment
mr
ambassador
hutchinson
screamed
in
effect
whispered
in
my
ear
do
feel
any
reluctance
about
shaking
hands
with
a
sandwich
in
your
other
hand
that
standard
practice
here
you
struck
just
the
right
note
up
there
that
business
with
the
liquor
was
positively
inspired
the
sandwiches
huge
masses
of
meat
and
hot
relish
wrapped
in
tortillas
of
some
sort
arrived
and
i
bit
into
one
i
been
eating
supercow
all
my
life
frozen
or
for
transportation
and
now
i
was
discovering
that
i
had
never
really
eaten
supercow
before
i
finished
the
first
sandwich
in
surprisingly
short
order
and
was
starting
on
my
second
when
the
crowd
began
coming
first
the
diplomatic
corps
the
usual
collection
of
weirdies
human
and
otherwise
there
was
the
ambassador
from
tara
in
a
suit
of
what
his
planet
produced
as
a
substitute
for
irish
homespuns
his
embassy
if
it
was
like
the
others
i
had
seen
elsewhere
would
be
an
outsize
cottage
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
thatched
roof
with
a
bowl
of
milk
outside
the
door
for
the
little
people
the
ambassador
from
alpheratz
ii
the
south
african
nationalist
planet
with
a
full
beard
and
old
fashioned
plug
hat
and
they
were
a
frustrated
lot
they
had
gone
into
space
to
practice
and
had
settled
on
a
planet
where
there
was
no
other
intelligent
race
to
be
superior
to
the
mormon
ambassador
from
deseret
delta
camelopardalis
v
the
ambassador
from
spica
vii
a
short
little
fellow
with
a
head
like
a
seal
long
arms
short
legs
and
a
tail
like
a
kangaroo
the
ambassador
from
beta
cephus
vi
who
could
have
passed
for
human
if
he
had
had
blood
with
a
copper
base
instead
of
iron
his
skin
was
a
dark
green
and
his
hair
was
a
bright
blue
i
was
beginning
to
correct
my
first
impression
that
thrombley
was
a
complete
dithering
fool
he
stood
at
my
left
elbow
whispering
the
names
and
governments
and
home
planets
of
the
ambassadors
as
they
came
up
handing
me
little
slips
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
phonetically
correct
renditions
of
the
greetings
i
would
give
them
in
their
own
language
i
was
still
twittering
a
reply
to
the
greeting
of
nanadabadian
from
beta
cephus
vi
when
he
whispered
to
me
here
it
comes
sir
the
the
were
reasonably
close
to
human
stature
and
appearance
allowing
for
the
fact
that
their
ancestry
had
been
canine
instead
of
simian
they
had
of
course
longer
and
narrower
jaws
than
we
have
and
definitely
carnivorous
teeth
there
were
stories
floating
around
that
they
enjoyed
barbecued
terran
even
better
than
they
did
supercow
and
hot
relish
this
one
advanced
extending
his
hand
i
am
most
happy
to
make
connection
with
solar
league
representative
he
said
i
am
named
gglafrr
ddespttann
vuvuvu
no
wonder
thrombley
let
him
introduce
himself
i
answered
in
the
basic
english
that
was
all
he
admit
to
understanding
the
name
of
your
great
nation
has
gone
before
you
to
me
the
stories
we
tell
to
our
young
of
you
are
at
the
top
of
our
books
i
have
hope
to
make
great
pleasure
in
you
and
me
to
be
friends
gglafrr
vuvuvu
smile
wavered
a
little
at
the
oblique
reference
to
the
couple
of
trouncings
our
space
navy
had
administered
to
ships
in
the
past
we
will
be
in
the
same
place
again
times
with
no
number
the
alien
replied
i
have
hope
for
you
that
time
you
are
in
this
place
will
be
long
and
will
put
pleasure
in
your
heart
then
the
pressure
of
the
line
behind
him
pushed
him
on
cabinet
members
senators
and
representatives
prominent
citizens
mostly
judge
or
colonel
it
was
all
a
blur
so
much
so
that
it
was
an
instant
before
i
recognized
the
gleaming
golden
hair
and
the
statuesque
figure
thank
you
i
have
met
the
ambassador
the
lovely
voice
was
shaking
with
restrained
anger
gail
i
exclaimed
your
father
coming
to
the
barbecue
gail
president
hutchinson
was
asking
he
ought
to
be
here
any
minute
he
sent
me
on
ahead
from
the
hotel
he
wants
to
meet
the
ambassador
that
why
i
joined
the
line
well
suppose
i
leave
mr
silk
in
your
hands
for
a
while
hutchinson
said
i
ought
to
circulate
around
a
little
yes
just
leave
him
in
my
hands
she
said
vindictively
what
wrong
gail
i
wanted
to
know
i
know
i
was
supposed
to
meet
you
at
the
spaceport
but
you
made
a
beautiful
fool
of
me
at
the
spaceport
look
i
can
explain
everything
my
embassy
staff
insisted
on
hurrying
me
off
somebody
gave
a
whoop
directly
behind
me
and
emptied
the
clip
of
a
pistol
i
could
even
hear
what
else
i
said
i
could
hear
what
she
said
either
but
it
was
something
angry
you
have
to
listen
to
me
i
roared
in
her
ear
i
can
explain
everything
any
diplomat
can
explain
anything
she
shouted
back
look
gail
you
hanging
an
innocent
man
i
yelled
back
at
her
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
somebody
on
the
platform
began
firing
his
pistol
within
inches
of
the
and
it
sounded
like
an
going
off
she
grabbed
my
wrist
and
dragged
me
toward
a
door
under
the
platform
down
here
she
yelled
and
this
better
be
good
mr
silk
we
went
down
a
spiral
ramp
lighted
by
overhead
lights
shelter
she
explained
and
look
what
goes
on
in
is
one
thing
but
it
as
much
as
a
girl
reputation
is
worth
to
come
down
here
during
a
barbecue
there
seemed
to
be
quite
few
girls
at
that
barbecue
who
did
care
what
happened
to
their
reputations
we
discovered
that
after
looking
into
a
couple
of
passageways
that
branched
off
the
entrance
over
this
way
gail
said
confederate
courts
building
there
wo
be
anything
going
on
over
here
now
i
told
her
with
as
much
humorous
detail
as
possible
about
how
thrombley
had
shanghaied
me
to
the
embassy
and
about
the
chase
by
the
rangers
before
i
was
half
through
she
was
laughing
heartily
all
traces
of
her
anger
gone
finally
we
came
to
a
stairway
and
at
the
head
of
it
to
a
small
door
it
been
four
years
that
i
been
away
from
here
she
said
i
think
there
a
reading
room
of
the
law
library
up
here
let
go
in
and
enjoy
the
quiet
for
a
while
but
when
we
opened
the
door
there
was
a
ranger
standing
inside
come
to
see
a
trial
mr
silk
oh
hello
gail
just
in
time
going
to
prepare
for
the
next
trial
as
he
spoke
something
clicked
at
the
door
gail
looked
at
me
in
consternation
now
we
locked
in
she
said
we
ca
get
out
till
the
trial
over
chapter
v
i
looked
around
we
were
on
a
high
balcony
at
the
end
of
a
long
narrow
room
in
front
of
us
windows
rose
to
the
ceiling
and
it
was
evident
that
the
floor
of
the
room
was
about
twenty
feet
below
ground
level
outside
i
could
see
the
barbecue
still
going
on
but
not
a
murmur
of
noise
penetrated
to
us
what
seemed
to
be
the
judge
bench
was
against
the
outside
wall
under
the
tall
windows
to
the
right
of
it
was
a
railed
stand
with
a
chair
in
it
and
in
front
arranged
in
were
three
tables
at
which
a
number
of
men
were
hastily
conferring
there
were
nine
judges
in
a
row
on
the
bench
all
in
black
gowns
the
spectators
seats
below
were
filled
with
people
and
there
were
quite
a
few
up
here
on
the
balcony
what
is
this
supreme
court
i
asked
as
gail
piloted
me
to
a
couple
of
seats
where
we
could
be
alone
no
court
of
political
justice
she
told
me
this
is
the
court
going
to
try
those
three
bonney
brothers
who
killed
mr
cumshaw
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
anything
specific
about
the
death
of
my
predecessor
that
is
the
trial
that
going
on
now
i
hope
oh

the
table

left

the
prosecution
friends
of
the

friends
of
the

just
anybody

any
interest
in
the
case
people
who
want
to
get
some
point
of
law
cleared
up
or
see
some
precedent
established
or
something
like
that
you
seem
to
assume
that
this
is
a
homicide
case
i
mentioned
they
generally
are
sometimes
mayhem
or
wounding
or
simple
assault
but
there
had
been
some
sort
of
conference
going
on
in
the
open
space
of
floor
between
the
judges
bench
and
the
three
tables
it
broke

white
sombrero

with

on
the
front
steps
of
the
legislative
assembly
building
in
the
city

new
austin

and

years
in

senate
all
a
matter
of
public
record
i
assume
that
the
prosecution
is
going
to
introduce
all
that
too
well
naturally
the
prosecutor
began
including
his
public
acts
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
the
counsel
for
the
defense
demanded
his
actions
on
the

record
of
this
court
the
counsel
for
the
defense
said
and
thereafter
we
rest
our
case
has
the
prosecution
anything
to
say
before
we
close
the
court
judge
nelson
inquired
well
your
honor
this
seems
that
is
we
ought
to
hear
both
sides
of
it
my
old
friend
aus
maverick
was
really
a
fine
man
he
did
a
lot
of
good
for
the
people
of
his
continent
yeah
we
of
lynched
him
when
he
got
back
if
somebody
had
chopped
him
up
here
in
new
austin
a
voice
from
the
rear
of
the
courtroom
broke
in
the
prosecution
hemmed
and
hawed
for
a
moment
and
then
announced
in
a
hasty
mumble
that
it
rested
i
will
now
close
the
court
judge
nelson
said
i
advise
everybody
to
keep
your
seats
i
do
think
it
going
to
be
closed
very
long
and
then
he
actually
closed
the
court
pressing
a
button
on
the
bench
he
raised
a
high
black
screen
in
front
of
him
and
his
colleagues
it
stayed
up
for
some
sixty
seconds
and
then
dropped
again
the
court
of
political
justice
has
reached
a
verdict
he
announced
wilbur
whately
and
your
attorney
approach
and
hear
the
verdict
the
defense
lawyer
motioned
a
young
man
who
had
been
sitting
beside
him
to
rise
in
the
silence
that
had
fallen
i
could
hear
the
boots
squeaking
as
he
went
forward
to
hear
his
fate
the
judge
picked
up
a
belt
and
a
pair
of
pistols
that
had
been
lying
in
front
of
him
wilbur
whately
he
began
this
court
is
proud
to
announce
that
you
have
been
unanimously
acquitted
of
the
charge
of
political
irresponsibility
and
of
unjustified
and
excessive
atrocity
there
was
one
dissenting
vote
on
acquitting
you
of
the
charge
of
political
irresponsibility
one
of
the
associate
judges
felt
that
the
late
unmitigated
scoundrel
austin
maverick
ought
to
have
been
skinned
alive
an
inch
at
a
time
you
are
however
acquitted
of
that
charge
too
you
all
know
he
continued
addressing
the
entire
assemblage
the
reason
for
which
this
young
hero
cut
down
that
monster
of
political
iniquity
austin
maverick
on
the
very
morning
of
his
death
austin
maverick
using
the
powers
of
his
political
influence
rammed
through
the
finance
and
revenue
committee
a
bill
entitled
act
for
the
taxing
of
personal
incomes
and
for
the
levying
of
a
withholding
tax
fellow
citizens
words
fail
me
to
express
my
horror
of
this
diabolic
proposition
this
proposed
instrument
of
tyrannical
extortion
borrowed
from
the
dark
ages
of
the
twentieth
century
why
if
this
young
nobleman
had
not
taken
his
blade
in
hand
i
have
killed
the
sonofabitch
myself
he
leaned
forward
extending
the
belt
and
holsters
to
the
defendant
i
therefore
restore
to
you
your
weapons
taken
from
you
when
in
compliance
with
the
law
you
were
formally
arrested
buckle
them
on
and
assuming
your
weapons
again
go
forth
from
this
court
a
free
man
wilbur
whately
and
take
with
you
that
machete
with
which
you
vindicated
the
liberties
and
rights
of
all
new
texans
bear
it
reverently
to
your
home
hang
it
among
your
lares
and
penates
cherish
it
and
dying
mention
it
within
your
will
bequeathing
it
as
a
rich
legacy
unto
your
issue
court
adjourned
next
session
tomorrow
for
chrissake
get
out
of
here
before
the
barbecue
over
some
of
the
spectators
drooling
for
barbecued
supercow
began
crowding
and
jostling
toward
the
exits
more
of
them
were
pushing
to
the
front
of
the
courtroom
cheering
and
waving
their
the
prosecution
and
about
half
of
the
friends
of
the
court
hastily
left
by
a
side
door
probably
to
issue
statements
disassociating
themselves
from
the
deceased
maverick
so
that
the
court
that
going
to
try
the
men
who
killed
ambassador
cumshaw
i
commented
as
gail
and
i
went
out
why
the
purpose
of
that
court
seems
to
be
to
acquit
murderers
murderers
she
was
indignant
that
was
murder
he
just
killed
a
politician
all
the
court
could
do
was
determine
whether
or
not
the
politician
needed
it
and
while
i
never
heard
about
proposition
i
ca
see
how
they
could
have
brought
in
any
other
kind
of
a
verdict
of
all
the
outrageous
things
i
was
thoughtfully
silent
as
we
went
out
into
the
plaza
which
was
still
a
riot
of
noise
and
polychromatic
costumes
and
my
thoughts
were
as
weltered
as
the
scene
before
me
apparently
on
new
texas
killing
a
politician
was
regarded
as
in
and
was
only
to
the
extent
that
what
happened
to
the
politician
was
in
excess
of
what
he
deserved
i
began
to
understand
why
palme
was
such
a
scared
rabbit
why
hutchinson
had
that
hunted
look
and
kept
his
hands
always
within
inches
of
his
pistols
i
began
to
feel
more
pity
than
contempt
for
thrombley
too
been
on
this
planet
too
long
and
he
should
never
have
been
sent
here
in
the
first
place
i
rotate
him
home
as
soon
as
possible
then
the
full
meaning
of
what
i
had
seen
finally
got
through
to
me
if
they
were
going
to
try
the
killers
of
cumshaw
in
that
court
that
meant
that
on
new
texas
foreign
diplomats
were
regarded
as
practicing
politicians
that
made
me
a
practicing
politician
too
and
that
why
when
we
got
back
to
the
vicinity
of
the
bandstand
i
had
my
right
hand
close
to
my
pistol
with
my
thumb
on
the
inconspicuous
little
spot
of
silver
inlay
that
operated
the
secret
holster
mechanism
i
saw
hutchinson
and
palme
and
thrombley
ahead
with
them
was
a
newcomer
a
portly
gentleman
with
a
white
mustache
and
goatee
dressed
in
a
white
suit
gail
broke
away
from
me
and
ran
toward
him
this
i
thought
would
be
her
father
now
i
would
be
introduced
and
find
out
just
what
her
last
name
was
i
followed
more
slowly
and
saw
a
waiter
with
a
wheeled
move
in
behind
the
group
which
she
had
joined
so
i
saw
what
none
of
them
did
the
waiter
suddenly
reversed
his
long
and
poised
himself
for
a
blow
at
president
back
i
simply
pressed
the
little
silver
stud
on
my
belt
the
popped
obediently
out
of
the
holster
into
my
open
hand
i
thumbed
off
the
safety
and
swung
up
when
my
sights
closed
on
the
rising
hand
that
held
the
knife
i
fired
hoddy
ringo
who
had
been
holding
a
sandwich
with
one
hand
and
a
drink
with
the
other
dropped
both
and
jumped
on
the
man
whose
hand
i
had
smashed
a
couple
of
rangers
closed
in
and
grabbed
him
also
the
group
around
president
hutchinson
had
all
turned
and
were
staring
from
me
to
the
man
i
had
shot
and
from
him
to
the
knife
with
the
broken
handle
lying
on
the
ground
hutchinson
spoke
first
well
mr
ambassador
my
government
thanks
your
government
that
was
nice
shooting
hey
you
been
holdin
out
on
me
hoddy
accused
i
never
knew
you
was
that
kinda
gunfighter
there
a
new
wrinkle
the
man
with
the
white
goatee
said
we
have
to
screen
the
help
at
these
affairs
a
little
more
closely
he
turned
to
me
mr
ambassador
new
texas
owes
you
a
great
deal
for
saving
the
president
life
if
you
get
that
pistol
out
of
your
hand
i
be
proud
to
shake
it
sir
i
holstered
my
automatic
and
took
his
hand
gail
was
saying
stephen
this
is
my
father
and
at
the
same
time
palme
the
secretary
of
state
was
doing
it
more
formally
ambassador
silk
may
i
present
one
of
our
leading
citizens
and
large
ranchers
colonel
andrew
jackson
hickock
dumbarton
oaks
had
taught
me
how
to
maintain
the
proper
unchanging
expression
drinking
superbourbon
had
been
a
course
i
needed
that
training
as
i
finally
learned
gail
last
name
chapter
vi
it
was
early
evening
before
we
finally
managed
to
get
away
from
the
barbecue
thrombley
had
called
the
embassy
and
told
them
not
to
wait
dinner
for
us
so
the
staff
had
finished
eating
and
were
relaxing
in
the
patio
when
our
car
came
in
through
the
street
gate
stonehenge
and
another
man
came
over
to
meet
us
as
we
got
out
a
man
i
had
met
before
he
was
a
little
fellow
in
new
texas
costume
and
wearing
a
pair
of
pistols
like
mine
in
state
department
special
services
holsters
he
did
look
like
a
dumbarton
oaks
product
i
thought
he
was
more
likely
an
alumnus
of
some
private
detective
agency
francisco
parros
our
intelligence
man
stonehenge
introduced
him
sorry
i
was
here
when
you
arrived
mr
silk
parros
said
out
checking
on
some
things
but
i
saw
that
bit
of
shooting
on
the
telecast
screen
in
a
bar
over
town
you
know
there
was
a
camera
right
over
the
bandstand
that
caught
the
whole
thing
you
and
miss
hickock
coming
toward
the
president
and
his
party
miss
hickock
running
forward
to
her
father
the
waiter
going
up
behind
hutchinson
with
the
knife
and
then
that
beautiful
draw
and
snap
shot
they
ran
it
again
a
couple
of
times
on
the
newscast
everybody
in
new
austin
maybe
on
new
texas
is
talking
about
it
now
yes
indeed
sir
gomez
the
embassy
secretary
said
joining
us
you
made
yourself
more
popular
in
the
eight
hours
since
you
landed
than
poor
cumshaw
had
been
able
to
do
in
the
ten
years
he
spent
here
but
i
afraid
sir
you
given
me
a
good
deal
of
work
answering
your
we
went
over
and
sat
down
at
one
of
the
big
tables
under
the
arches
at
the
side
of
the
patio
well
that
all
to
the
good
i
said
i
going
to
need
a
lot
of
local
good
will
in
the
next
few
weeks
no
thanks
parros
i
added
as
the
intelligence
man
picked
up
a
bottle
and
made
to
pour
for
me
i
been
practically
swimming
in
superbourbon
all
afternoon
a
little
black
coffee
if
you
do
mind
and
now
gentlemen
if
you
all
be
seated
we
see
what
has
to
be
done
a
council
of
war
in
effect
mr
ambassador
stonehenge
inquired
let
call
it
a
council
to
estimate
the
situation
but
i
have
to
find
out
from
you
first
exactly
what
the
situation
here
is
thrombley
stirred
uneasily
but
sir
i
confess
that
i
do
understand
your
briefing
on
luna
was
practically
nonexistent
i
had
a
total
of
six
hours
to
get
aboard
ship
from
the
moment
i
was
notified
that
i
had
been
appointed
to
this
embassy
incredible
thrombley
murmured
i
wondered
what
he
say
if
i
told
him
that
i
thought
it
was
deliberate
naturally
i
spent
some
time
on
the
ship
reading
up
on
this
planet
but
i
know
practically
nothing
about
what
been
going
on
here
in
say
the
last
year
and
all
i
know
about
the
death
of
cumshaw
is
that
he
is
said
to
have
been
killed
by
three
brothers
named
bonney
so
you
want
just
about
everything
mr
silk
thrombley
said
really
i
do
know
where
to
begin
start
with
why
and
how
cumshaw
was
killed
the
rest
i
believe
will
key
into
that
so
they
began
thrombley
stonehenge
and
parros
doing
the
talking
it
came
to
this
ever
since
we
had
first
established
an
embassy
on
new
texas
the
goal
of
our
diplomacy
on
this
planet
had
been
to
secure
it
into
the
solar
league
and
it
was
a
goal
which
seemed
very
little
closer
to
realization
now
than
it
had
been
years
before
you
must
know
by
now
what
politics
on
this
planet
are
like
mr
silk
thrombley
said
i
have
an
idea
one
ambassador
gone
native
another
gone
crazy
the
third
killed
himself
the
fourth
murdered
yes
indeed
i
been
here
fifteen
years
myself
that
entirely
too
long
for
anybody
to
be
stationed
in
this
place
i
told
him
if
i
not
murdered
myself
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
going
to
see
that
you
and
any
other
member
of
this
staff
who
been
here
over
ten
years
are
rotated
home
for
a
tour
of
duty
at
department
headquarters
oh
would
you
mr
silk
i
would
be
so
happy
thrombley
was
much
in
the
way
of
an
ally
but
at
least
he
had
a
sound
selfish
motive
for
helping
me
stay
alive
i
assured
him
i
would
get
him
sent
back
to
luna
and
then
went
on
with
the
discussion
up
until
six
months
ago
silas
cumshaw
had
modeled
himself
after
the
typical
new
texas
politician
he
had
always
worn
at
least
two
faces
and
had
always
managed
to
place
himself
on
every
side
of
every
issue
at
once
nothing
he
ever
said
could
possibly
be
construed
as
controversial
naturally
the
cause
of
new
texan
annexation
to
the
solar
league
had
made
no
progress
whatever
then
one
evening
at
a
banquet
he
had
executed
a
complete
turn
delivering
a
speech
in
which
he
proclaimed
that
union
with
the
solar
league
was
the
only
possible
way
in
which
new
texans
could
retain
even
a
vestige
of
local
sovereignty
he
had
talked
about
an
invasion
as
though
the
enemy
ships
were
already
coming
out
of
hyperspace
and
had
named
the
invader
calling
the
our
common
enemy
the
ambassador
also
present
had
immediately
gotten
up
and
stalked
out
amid
a
derisive
chorus
of
barking
and
baying
from
the
new
texans
the
new
texans
were
first
shocked
and
then
wildly
delighted
they
had
been
so
used
to
hearing
nothing
but
inanities
and
abstractions
from
their
public
figures
that
the
solar
league
ambassador
had
become
a
hero
overnight
sounds
as
though
there
is
a
really
strong
sentiment
at
what
used
to
be
called
the
level
in
favor
of
annexation
i
commented
there
is
parros
told
me
of
course
there
is
a
very
strong
isolationist
sentiment
too
the
sentiment
in
favor
of
annexation
is
based
on
the
point
cumshaw
made
the
danger
of
conquest
by
the
against
that
of
course
there
is
fear
of
higher
taxes
fear
of
loss
of
local
sovereignty
fear
of
abrogation
of
local
customs
and
institutions
and
chauvinistic
pride
we
can
deal
with
some
of
that
by
furnishing
guarantees
of
local
the
emotional
objections
can
be
met
by
convincing
them
that
we
need
the
great
planet
of
new
texas
to
add
glory
and
luster
to
the
solar
league
i
said
you
think
then
that
cumshaw
was
assassinated
by
opponents
of
annexation
of
course
sir
thrombley
replied
these
bonneys
were
only
hirelings
here
what
happened
on
the
day
of
the
murder
it
was
the
day
after
a
holiday
a
big
one
here
on
new
texas
celebrating
some
military
victory
by
the
texans
on
terra
a
battle
called
san
jacinto
we
did
have
any
business
to
handle
because
all
the
local
officials
were
home
nursing
hangovers
so
when
colonel
hickock
called
who
i
asked
sharply
colonel
hickock
the
father
of
the
young
lady
you
were
so
attentive
to
at
the
barbecue
he
and
cumshaw
had
become
great
friends
beginning
shortly
before
the
speech
the
ambassador
made
at
that
banquet
he
called
about
inviting
cumshaw
out
to
his
ranch
for
the
day
and
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
official
business
cumshaw
said
be
out
by
when
he
got
there
there
was
an
aircar
circling
about
near
the
ranchhouse
as
cumshaw
got
out
of
his
car
and
started
up
the
front
steps
somebody
in
this
car
landed
it
on
the
driveway
and
began
shooting
with
a
cumshaw
was
hit
several
times
and
killed
instantly
the
fellows
who
did
the
shooting
were
damned
lucky
stonehenge
took
over
hickock
a
big
rancher
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
sir
but
those
things
have
to
be
herded
with
tanks
and
light
aircraft
so
that
every
rancher
has
at
his
disposal
a
fairly
good
small
combat
team
naturally
all
the
big
ranchers
are
colonels
in
the
armed
reserve
hickock
has
about
fifteen
fast
fighters
and
thirty
medium
tanks
armed
with
guns
he
also
has
some
around
his
ranch
house
every
once
in
a
while
these
ranchers
get
to
squabbling
among
themselves
well
these
three
bonney
brothers
were
just
turning
away
when
a
burst
from
the
ranch
house
caught
their
jet
assembly
and
they
could
only
get
as
far
as
bonneyville
thirty
miles
away
before
they
had
to
land
they
landed
right
in
front
of
the
town
jail
this
bonneyville
an
awful
shantytown
everybody
in
it
is
related
to
everybody
else
the
mayor
for
instance
sam
bonney
is
an
uncle
of
theirs
these
three
boys
switchblade
joe
bonney
abe
bonney
and
tom
bonney
immediately
claimed
sanctuary
in
the
jail
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
been
near
to
get
that
i
think
that
indicates
the
line
they
going
to
take
at
the
trial
to
a
political
assassination
they
were
immediately
given
the
protection
of
the
jail
which
is
about
the
only
building
in
the
place
practically
a
fort
you
think
that
was
planned
in
advance
i
asked
parros
nodded
emphatically
i
do
there
was
a
hell
of
a
big
gang
of
these
bonneys
at
the
jail
almost
the
entire
population
of
the
place
as
soon
as
switchblade
and
and
landed
they
were
rushed
inside
and
all
the
doors
barred
about
three
minutes
later
the
hickock
outfit
started
coming
in
first
aircraft
and
then
armor
they
gave
that
town
a
regular
georgie
patton
style
blitzing
yes
i
only
sorry
i
was
there
to
see
it
stonehenge
put
in
they
knocked
down
or
burned
most
of
the
shanties
and
then
they
went
to
work
on
the
jail
the
aircraft
began
dumping
these
firebombs
and
that
they
use
to
stop
supercow
stampedes
and
the
began
to
punch
holes
in
the
walls
as
soon
as
saw
what
he
had
on
his
hands
he
radioed
a
call
for
ranger
protection
our
friend
captain
nelson
went
out
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
yes
i
got
the
story
of
that
from
nelson
parros
put
in
much
as
he
hated
to
do
it
he
had
to
protect
the
bonneys
and
as
soon
as
he
taken
a
hand
hickock
had
to
call
off
his
gang
but
he
was
smart
he
grabbed
everything
relating
to
the
killing
the
aircar
and
the
in
particular
and
he
keeping
them
under
cover
very
few
people
know
about
that
or
about
the
fact
that
on
physical
evidence
alone
he
has
the
killing
pinned
on
the
bonneys
so
well
that
never
get
away
with
this
story
of
being
merely
innocent
witnesses
the
rest
mr
silk
is
up
to
us
thrombley
said
i
have
colonel
hickock
assurance
that
he
will
give
us
every
assistance
but
we
simply
must
see
to
it
that
those
creatures
with
the
outlandish
names
are
convicted
i
did
have
a
chance
to
say
anything
to
that
at
that
moment
one
of
the
servants
ushered
captain
nelson
toward
us
good
evening
captain
i
greeted
the
ranger
join
us
seeing
that
you
on
foreign
soil
and
consequently
not
on
duty
he
sat
down
with
us
and
poured
a
drink
i
thought
you
might
be
interested
he
said
we
gave
that
waiter
a
we
wanted
to
know
who
put
him
up
to
it
he
tried
to
sell
us
the
line
that
he
was
a
new
texan
patriot
trying
to
kill
a
tyrant
but
we
finally
got
the
truth
out
of
him
he
was
paid
a
thousand
pesos
to
do
the
job
by
a
character
they
call
sam
bonney
a
cousin
of
the
three
who
killed
mr
cumshaw
nephew
of
sam
parros
interjected
you
pick
him
up
nelson
shook
his
head
disgustedly
he
out
in
the
high
grass
somewhere
we
still
looking
for
him
oh
yes
and
i
just
heard
that
the
trial
of
switchblade
and
and
is
scheduled
for
three
days
from
now
you
be
notified
in
due
form
tomorrow
but
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
in
advance
i
certainly
do
and
thank
you
captain
we
were
just
talking
about
you
when
you
arrived
i
mentioned
about
the
arrest
or
rescue
or
whatever
you
call
it
of
that
trio
yeah
one
of
the
jobs
i
not
particularly
proud
of
pity
boys
did
get
hold
of
them
before
i
got
there
it
of
saved
everybody
a
lot
of
trouble
just
what
impression
did
you
get
at
the
time
captain
i
asked
you
think
knew
in
advance
what
they
were
going
to
do
sure
he
did
they
had
the
whole
jail
fortified
not
like
a
jail
usually
is
to
keep
people
from
getting
out
but
like
a
fort
to
keep
people
from
getting
in
there
were
no
prisoners
inside
i
found
out
that
they
had
all
been
released
that
morning
he
stopped
seemed
to
be
weighing
his
words
then
continued
speaking
very
slowly
let
me
tell
you
first
some
things
i
ca
testify
to
couple
of
things
that
i
figure
went
wrong
with
their
plans
one
of
colonel
hickock
men
was
on
the
porch
to
greet
cumshaw
and
he
recognized
the
bonneys
that
was
lucky
otherwise
we
might
still
be
lookin
and
wonderin
who
did
the
shootin
which
might
not
have
been
good
for
new
texas
he
cocked
an
eyebrow
and
i
nodded
the
solar
league
in
similar
cases
had
regarded
such
planetary
governments
as
due
for
change
without
notice
and
had
promptly
made
the
change
number
two
captain
nelson
continued
that
which
hit
their
aircar
i
do
think
they
intended
to
land
at
the
jail
it
was
just
sort
of
a
reserve
but
because
they
been
hit
they
had
to
land
and
they
been
slowed
down
so
much
that
they
could
dispose
of
the
evidence
before
the
colonel
boys
were
tappin
on
the
door
askin
could
they
come
in
i
gather
the
colonel
was
becoming
insistent
i
prompted
him
the
big
ranger
grinned
now
we
on
things
i
can
testify
to
when
i
got
there
what
had
been
the
was
on
fire
and
they
were
trying
to
defend
the
mayor
office
and
the
warden
office
these
bonneys
gave
me
the
line
that
they
been
witnesses
to
the
killing
of
cumshaw
by
colonel
hickock
and
that
the
hickock
outfit
was
trying
to
rub
them
out
to
keep
them
from
testifying
i
just
laughed
and
started
to
walk
out
finally
they
confessed
that
they
shot
cumshaw
but
they
claimed
it
was
right
of
action
against
political
malfeasance
when
they
did
that
i
had
to
take
them
in
they
confessed
to
you
before
you
arrested
them
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
that
point
that
right
i
going
to
testify
to
that
monday
when
the
trial
is
held
and
that
ai
all
we
got
their
fingerprints
off
the
car
off
the
gun
off
some
shells
still
in
the
clip
and
we
have
the
gun
identified
to
the
shells
that
killed
cumshaw
we
got
their
confession
fully
corroborated
i
asked
him
if
he
give
parros
a
complete
statement
of
what
seen
and
heard
at
bonneyville
he
was
more
than
willing
and
i
suggested
that
they
go
into
parros
office
where
they
be
undisturbed
the
ranger
and
my
intelligence
man
got
up
and
took
a
bottle
of
superbourbon
with
them
as
they
were
leaving
nelson
turned
to
hoddy
who
was
still
with
us
you
have
to
look
to
your
laurels
hoddy
nelson
said
your
ambassador
seems
to
be
making
quite
a
reputation
for
himself
as
a
gunfighter
look
hoddy
said
and
though
he
was
facing
nelson
i
felt
he
was
really
talking
to
stonehenge
before
i
go
up
against
this
guy
shoot
myself
that
way
i
could
be
sure
i
get
a
nice
painless
job
after
they
were
gone
i
turned
to
stonehenge
and
thrombley
this
seems
to
be
a
carefully
prearranged
killing
they
agreed
then
they
knew
that
cumshaw
would
be
on
colonel
hickock
front
steps
at
about
did
they
find
that
out
why
why
i
sure
i
do
know
thrombley
said
it
was
most
obvious
that
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
and
a
side
glance
told
me
that
the
thought
was
new
to
stonehenge
also
colonel
hickock
called
at
cumshaw
left
the
embassy
in
an
aircar
a
few
minutes
later
it
took
an
hour
and
a
half
to
fly
out
to
the
hickock
ranch
i
do
like
the
implications
mr
silk
stonehenge
said
i
believe
that
was
how
it
happened
in
the
first
place
colonel
hickock
is
that
sort
of
man
he
does
use
his
hospitality
to
trap
people
to
their
death
in
the
second
place
he
would
have
needed
to
use
people
like
these
bonneys
his
own
men
would
do
anything
for
him
in
the
third
place
he
is
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
annexation
movement
here
and
this
was
obviously
an
job
and
in
the
fourth
place
hold
it
i
checked
him
are
you
sure
he
really
on
the
annexation
side
he
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
me
quickly
then
closed
it
waited
a
moment
answered
me
slowly
i
can
guess
what
you
are
thinking
mr
silk
but
remember
when
colonel
hickock
came
here
as
our
first
ambassador
he
came
here
as
a
man
with
a
mission
he
had
studied
the
problem
and
he
believed
in
what
he
came
for
he
has
never
changed
let
me
emphasize
this
sir
we
know
he
has
never
changed
for
our
own
protection
we
had
to
check
on
every
real
leader
of
the
annexation
movement
screening
them
for
crackpots
who
might
do
us
more
harm
than
good
the
colonel
is
with
us
all
the
way
and
now
in
the
fourth
place
underlined
by
what
i
just
said
the
colonel
and
cumshaw
were
really
friends
now
you
talking
hoddy
burst
in
i
knowed
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
ever
since
he
married
old
colonel
mactodd
daughter
that
just
ai
the
way
j
works
on
the
other
hand
mr
ambassador
thrombley
said
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
on
hoddy
hands
and
apparently
ready
to
both
duck
and
shut
up
if
hoddy
moved
a
finger
you
will
recall
i
think
that
colonel
hickock
did
do
everything
in
his
power
to
see
that
these
bonney
brothers
did
not
reach
court
alive
and
let
me
add
he
was
getting
bolder
tilting
his
chin
up
a
little
it
a
choice
as
simple
as
this
either
colonel
hickock
told
them
or
we
have
and
this
is
unbelievable
a
traitor
in
the
embassy
itself
that
statement
rocked
even
hoddy
even
though
he
was
probably
no
more
than
one
of
natalenko
little
men
he
still
could
help
knowing
how
thoroughly
we
were
screened
indoctrinated
and
let
face
it
a
traitor
among
us
was
unthinkable
because
we
just
could
think
that
way
the
silence
the
sorrow
were
palpable
then
i
remembered
told
them
hickock
himself
had
been
a
department
man
stonehenge
gripped
his
head
between
his
hands
and
squeezed
as
if
trying
to
bring
out
an
idea
all
right
mr
ambassador
where
are
we
now
nobody
who
knew
could
have
told
the
bonney
boys
where
cumshaw
would
be
at
yet
the
three
men
were
there
waiting
for
him
you
take
it
from
there
i
just
a
simple
military
man
and
i
ready
to
go
back
to
the
simple
military
life
as
soon
as
possible
i
turned
to
gomez
there
could
be
an
obvious
explanation
bring
us
the
official
telescreen
log
let
see
what
calls
were
made
maybe
cumshaw
himself
said
something
to
someone
that
gave
his
destination
away
that
wo
be
necessary
thrombley
told
me
none
of
the
junior
clerks
were
on
duty
and
i
took
the
only
three
calls
that
came
in
myself
first
there
was
the
call
from
colonel
hickock
then
the
call
about
the
wrist
watch
and
then
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
call
from
the
hickock
ranch
about
cumshaw
death
what
was
the
call
about
the
wrist
watch
i
asked
oh
that
was
from
the
embassy
thrombley
said
for
some
time
cumshaw
had
been
trying
to
get
one
of
the
very
precise
watches
which
the
manufacture
on
their
home
planet
the
ambassador
called
that
day
to
tell
him
that
they
had
one
for
him
and
wanted
to
know
when
it
was
to
be
delivered
i
told
them
the
ambassador
was
out
and
they
wanted
to
know
where
they
could
call
him
and
i
i
had
never
seen
a
man
look
more
oh
my
god
i
the
one
who
told
them
what
could
i
say
not
much
but
i
tried
how
could
you
know
thrombley
you
did
the
natural
the
normal
the
proper
thing
on
a
call
from
one
ambassador
to
another
i
turned
to
the
others
who
like
me
preferred
not
to
look
at
thrombley
they
must
have
had
a
spy
outside
who
told
them
the
ambassador
had
left
the
embassy
alone
right
and
that
was
just
what
they
been
waiting
for
but
what
this
about
the
watch
though
there
more
to
this
than
a
simple
favor
from
one
ambassador
to
another
my
turn
mr
ambassador
stonehenge
interrupted
cumshaw
had
been
trying
to
get
one
of
the
things
at
my
insistence
naval
intelligence
is
very
much
interested
in
them
and
we
want
a
sample
the
watches
are
very
peculiar
they
operated
by
radium
decay
which
of
course
is
a
universal
constant
they
uniform
to
a
tenth
second
and
they
all
synchronized
with
the
official
time
at
the
capital
city
of
the
principal
planet
the
time
used
by
the
navy
stonehenge
deliberately
paused
let
that
last
phrase
hang
heavily
in
the
air
for
a
moment
then
he
continued
they
supposed
to
be
used
in
religious
observances
timing
hours
of
prayer
i
believe
they
can
of
course
have
other
uses
for
example
i
can
imagine
all
those
watches
giving
the
wearer
a
light
electric
shock
or
ringing
a
little
bell
all
over
new
texas
at
exactly
the
same
moment
and
then
i
can
imagine
all
the
running
down
into
nice
deep
holes
in
the
ground
he
looked
at
his
own
watch
and
that
reminds
me
my
gang
of
pirates
are
at
the
spaceport
by
now
ready
to
blast
off
i
wonder
if
someone
could
drive
me
there
i
drive
him
boss
hoddy
volunteered
i
ai
doin
nothin
else
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
break
that
up
plausibly
and
without
betraying
my
suspicions
when
parros
and
captain
nelson
came
out
and
joined
us
i
have
a
lot
of
stuff
here
parros
said
stuff
we
never
seemed
to
have
noticed
for
instance
i
interrupted
commander
stonehenge
going
to
the
spaceport
now
i
said
suppose
you
ride
with
him
and
brief
him
on
what
you
learned
on
the
way
then
when
he
aboard
come
back
and
tell
us
hoddy
looked
at
me
for
a
long
ten
seconds
his
expression
started
by
being
exasperated
and
ended
by
betraying
grudging
admiration
chapter
vii
the
next
morning
which
was
saturday
i
put
thrombley
in
charge
of
the
routine
work
of
the
embassy
but
first
instructed
him
to
answer
all
inquiries
about
me
with
the
statement
literally
true
that
i
was
too
immersed
in
work
of
clearing
up
matters
left
unfinished
after
the
death
of
the
former
ambassador
for
any
social
activities
then
i
called
the
hickock
ranch
in
the
west
end
of
sam
houston
continent
mentioning
an
invitation
the
colonel
and
his
daughter
had
extended
me
and
told
them
i
would
be
out
to
see
them
before
noon
that
same
day
with
hoddy
ringo
driving
the
car
i
arrived
about
and
was
welcomed
by
gail
and
her
father
who
had
flown
out
the
evening
before
after
the
barbecue
hoddy
accompanied
by
a
ranger
and
one
of
hickock
ranch
hands
all
three
disguised
in
shabby
and
borrowed
at
the
ranch
and
driving
a
dilapidated
aircar
from
the
ranch
junkyard
were
sent
to
visit
the
slum
village
of
bonneyville
they
spent
all
day
there
posing
as
a
trio
of
range
tramps
out
of
favor
with
the
law
i
spent
the
day
with
gail
flying
over
the
range
visiting
herd
camps
and
slaughtering
crews
it
was
a
pleasant
day
and
i
managed
to
make
it
constructive
as
well
because
of
their
huge
size
they
ran
to
a
live
weight
of
around
fifteen
tons
and
their
uncertain
disposition
supercows
are
not
really
domesticated
each
rancher
owned
the
herds
on
his
own
land
chiefly
by
virtue
of
constant
watchfulness
over
them
there
were
always
a
couple
of
helicopters
hovering
over
each
herd
with
fast
fighter
planes
waiting
on
call
to
come
in
and
drop
or
in
front
of
them
if
they
showed
a
disposition
to
wander
too
far
naturally
things
of
this
size
could
not
be
shipped
live
to
the
market
they
were
butchered
on
the
range
and
the
meat
hauled
out
in
big
slaughtering
was
dangerous
and
exciting
work
it
was
done
with
medium
tanks
mounting
guns
usually
working
at
the
rear
of
the
herd
although
a
supercow
herd
could
change
directions
almost
in
a
second
and
the
would
then
find
themselves
in
front
of
a
stampede
i
saw
several
such
incidents
once
gail
and
i
had
to
dive
in
with
our
car
and
help
turn
such
a
stampede
we
got
back
to
the
ranch
house
shortly
before
dinner
gail
went
at
once
to
change
clothes
colonel
hickock
and
i
sat
down
together
for
a
drink
in
his
library
a
beautiful
room
i
especially
admired
the
walls
panelled
in
what
do
you
think
of
our
planet
now
mr
silk
colonel
hickock
asked
well
colonel
your
final
message
to
the
state
was
part
of
the
briefing
i
received
i
replied
i
must
say
that
i
agree
with
your
opinions
especially
with
your
opinion
of
local
political
practices
politics
is
nothing
here
if
not
exciting
and
exacting
you
do
understand
it
though
that
was
about
and
particularly
our
custom
of
using
politicians
as
clay
pigeons
well
it
is
rather
unusual
yes
the
dryness
in
his
tone
was
a
paragraph
of
comment
on
my
understatement
and
it
fundamental
to
our
system
of
government
you
were
out
all
afternoon
with
gail
you
saw
how
we
have
to
handle
the
supercow
herds
well
it
is
upon
the
fact
that
every
rancher
must
have
at
his
disposal
a
powerful
force
of
aircraft
and
armor
easily
convertible
to
military
uses
that
our
political
freedom
rests
you
see
our
government
is
in
effect
an
oligarchy
of
the
big
landowners
and
ranchers
who
in
combination
have
enough
military
power
to
overturn
any
planetary
government
overnight
and
on
the
local
level
it
is
a
paternalistic
feudalism
that
something
that
would
have
stood
the
hair
of
any
twentieth
century
on
end
and
it
gives
us
the
freest
government
anywhere
in
the
galaxy
there
were
a
number
of
occasions
much
less
frequent
now
than
formerly
when
coalitions
of
big
ranches
combined
their
strength
and
marched
on
the
planetary
government
to
protect
their
rights
from
government
encroachment
this
sort
of
thing
could
only
be
resorted
to
in
defense
of
some
inherent
right
and
never
to
infringe
on
the
rights
of
others
because
in
the
latter
case
other
armed
coalitions
would
have
arisen
as
they
did
once
or
twice
during
the
first
three
decades
of
new
texan
history
to
resist
so
the
right
of
armed
intervention
by
the
people
when
the
government
invaded
or
threatened
their
rights
became
an
acknowledged
part
of
our
political
system
and
this
arises
as
a
natural
consequence
you
ca
give
a
man
with
five
hundred
employees
and
a
force
of
tanks
and
aircraft
the
right
to
resist
the
government
then
at
the
same
time
deny
that
right
to
a
man
who
has
only
his
own
pistol
or
machete
i
notice
the
president
and
the
other
officials
have
themselves
surrounded
by
guards
to
protect
them
from
individual
attack
i
said
why
does
the
government
as
such
protect
itself
with
an
army
and
air
force
large
enough
to
resist
any
possible
coalition
of
the
big
ranchers
we
wo
let
the
government
get
that
strong
the
colonel
said
forcefully
that
one
of
the
basic
premises
we
have
no
standing
army
only
the
new
texas
rangers
and
the
legislature
wo
authorize
any
standing
army
or
appropriate
funds
to
support
one
any
member
of
the
legislature
who
tried
it
would
get
what
austin
maverick
got
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
or
what
sam
saltkin
got
eight
years
ago
when
he
proposed
a
law
for
the
compulsory
registration
and
licensing
of
firearms
the
opposition
to
that
tax
scheme
of
maverick
was
because
of
what
it
would
cost
the
public
in
taxes
but
from
fear
of
what
the
government
could
do
with
the
money
after
they
got
it
keep
a
government
poor
and
weak
and
it
your
servant
let
it
get
rich
and
powerful
and
it
your
master
we
do
want
any
masters
here
on
new
texas
but
the
president
has
a
bodyguard
i
noted
casualty
rate
was
too
high
hickock
explained
remember
the
president
job
is
inherently
impossible
he
has
to
represent
the
people
i
thought
that
over
could
see
the
illogical
logic
but
how
about
your
rancher
oligarchy
he
laughed
son
if
i
started
acting
like
a
master
around
this
ranch
in
the
morning
they
find
my
body
in
an
irrigation
ditch
before
sunset
sure
if
you
have
a
real
army
you
can
keep
the
men
under
your
thumb
use
one
regiment
or
one
division
to
put
down
mutiny
in
another
but
when
you
have
only
five
hundred
men
all
of
whom
know
everybody
else
and
all
of
them
armed
you
just
act
real
considerate
of
them
if
you
want
to
keep
on
living
then
would
you
say
that
the
opposition
to
annexation
comes
from
the
people
who
are
afraid
that
if
new
texas
enters
the
solar
league
there
will
be
league
troops
sent
here
and
this
this
interesting
system
of
insuring
government
responsibility
to
the
public
would
be
brought
to
an
end
yes
if
you
can
show
the
people
of
this
planet
that
the
league
interfere
with
local
political
practices
you
have
a
percent
majority
in
favor
of
annexation
we
too
close
to
the
out
here
not
to
see
the
benefits
of
joining
the
solar
league
we
left
the
hickock
ranch
on
sunday
afternoon
and
while
hoddy
guided
our
back
to
new
austin
i
had
a
little
time
to
revise
some
of
my
ideas
about
new
texas
that
is
i
had
time
to
think
during
those
few
moments
when
hoddy
was
taking
advantage
of
our
diplomatic
immunity
to
invent
new
traffic
laws
my
thoughts
alternated
between
the
pleasure
of
remembering
gail
gay
company
and
the
gloom
of
understanding
the
complete
implications
of
the
colonel
clarifying
lectures
against
the
background
of
his
remarks
i
could
find
myself
appreciating
the
reasoning
the
only
way
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
was
to
have
another
solar
league
ambassador
killed
and
whenever
i
could
escape
thinking
about
the
fact
that
the
next
ambassador
to
be
the
clay
pigeon
was
me
i
found
myself
wondering
if
i
wanted
the
league
to
take
over
annexation
yes
new
texas
customs
would
be
protected
under
a
treaty
of
annexation
but
the
justified
conquest
urged
by
machiavelli
no
i
was
still
struggling
with
the
problem
when
we
reached
the
embassy
about
everyone
was
there
including
stonehenge
who
had
returned
two
hours
earlier
with
the
good
news
that
the
fleet
had
moved
into
position
only
sixty
off
capella
iv
i
had
reached
the
point
in
my
thinking
where
i
had
decided
it
was
useless
to
keep
hoddy
and
stonehenge
apart
except
as
an
exercise
in
mental
agility
inasmuch
as
my
brain
was
already
swinging
from
a
flying
trapeze
to
elusive
flying
rings
while
doing
triple
somersaults
and
at
the
same
time
juggling
seven
indian
clubs
i
skipped
the
whole
matter
but
i
fairly
certain
that
it
was
till
then
that
hoddy
had
a
chance
to
deliver
his
to
stonehenge
after
dinner
we
gathered
in
my
office
for
our
coffee
and
a
final
conference
before
the
opening
of
the
trial
the
next
morning
stonehenge
spoke
first
looking
around
the
table
at
everyone
except
me
no
matter
what
happens
we
have
the
fleet
within
call
sir
been
active
picking
up
those
boats
they
no
longer
have
a
tight
screen
around
the
system
we
do
i
do
think
that
anyone
except
us
knows
that
the
fleet
where
it
is
matter
what
i
thought
glumly
and
the
phrase
explained
why
he
had
been
able
to
look
at
me
well
boss
i
gave
you
my
end
of
it
comin
in
hoddy
said
want
me
to
go
over
it
again
all
right
in
bonneyville
we
found
half
a
dozen
people
who
can
swear
that
sam
bonney
was
making
preparations
to
protect
those
three
brothers
an
hour
before
ambassador
cumshaw
was
shot
the
whole
town
sorer
than
hell
at
for
antagonizing
the
hickock
outfit
and
getting
the
place
shot
up
the
way
it
was
and
we
have
witnesses
that
was
in
some
kind
of
deal
with
the
too
the
rangers
gathered
up
eight
of
them
who
can
swear
to
the
preparations
and
to
the
fact
that
had
visitors
on
different
occasions
before
the
shooting
that
what
we
want
stonehenge
said
something
that
connect
this
murder
with
the
well
wait
till
you
hear
what
i
got
parros
told
him
in
the
first
place
we
traced
the
gun
and
the
the
bonney
brothers
bought
them
both
from
merchants
for
ridiculously
nominal
prices
the
merchant
who
sold
the
aircar
is
normally
in
the
business
and
the
one
who
sold
the
runs
a
toy
shop
in
their
whole
lives
those
three
boys
never
had
enough
money
among
them
to
pay
the
list
price
of
the
gun
let
alone
the
car
that
is
not
until
a
week
before
the
murder
they
got
prosperous
all
of
a
sudden
i
asked
yes
two
weeks
before
the
shooting
sam
bank
account
got
a
sudden
transfusion
some
anonymous
benefactor
deposited
pesos
about
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
his
credit
he
drew
out
of
it
and
some
of
the
money
turned
up
again
in
the
hands
of
switchblade
and
and
then
a
week
before
you
landed
here
he
got
another
hundred
thousand
from
the
same
anonymous
source
and
he
drew
out
twenty
thousand
of
that
we
think
that
was
the
money
that
went
to
pay
for
the
attempted
on
hutchinson
two
days
before
the
barbecue
the
waiter
deposited
a
thousand
at
the
new
austin
packers
and
shippers
trust
can
you
get
that
introduced
as
evidence
at
the
trial
i
asked
sure
banks
at
a
town
called
crooked
creek
about
forty
miles
from
bonneyville
we
have
witnesses
from
the
bank
i
also
got
the
dope
on
the
line
the
bonney
brothers
are
going
to
take
at
the
trial
they
have
a
lawyer
clement
sidney
a
member
of
what
passes
for
the
socialist
party
on
this
planet
the
defense
will
take
the
line
of
full
denial
of
everything
the
bonneys
are
just
three
poor
but
honest
boys
who
are
being
framed
by
the
corrupt
tools
of
the
big
ranching
interests
hoddy
made
an
impolite
noise
whatta
we
got
to
worry
about
then
he
demanded
they
a
cinch
for
conviction
i
agree
with
that
stonehenge
said
if
they
tried
to
base
their
defense
on
political
conviction
and
opposition
by
the
solar
league
they
might
have
a
chance
this
way
they
have
all
right
gentlemen
i
said
i
take
it
that
we
agreed
that
we
must
all
follow
a
single
line
of
policy
and
not
work
at
to
each
other
they
all
agreed
to
that
instantly
but
with
a
questioning
note
in
their
voices
well
then
i
trust
you
all
realize
that
we
can
not
under
any
circumstances
allow
those
three
brothers
to
be
convicted
in
this
court
i
added
there
was
a
moment
of
startled
silence
while
hoddy
and
stonehenge
and
parros
and
thrombley
were
understanding
what
they
had
just
heard
then
stonehenge
cleared
his
throat
and
said
mr
ambassador
i
sure
that
you
have
some
excellent
reasons
for
that
remarkable
statement
but
i
must
say
it
was
a
really
colossal
error
on
somebody
part
i
said
that
this
case
was
allowed
to
get
into
the
court
of
political
justice
it
never
should
have
and
if
we
take
a
part
in
the
prosecution
or
allow
those
men
to
be
convicted
we
will
establish
a
precedent
to
support
the
principle
that
a
foreign
ambassador
is
on
this
planet
defined
as
a
practicing
local
politician
i
will
invite
you
to
digest
that
for
a
moment
a
moment
was
all
they
needed
thrombley
was
horrified
and
dithered
incoherently
stonehenge
frowned
and
fidgeted
with
some
papers
in
front
of
him
i
could
see
several
thoughts
gathering
behind
his
eyes
including
i
was
sure
a
new
view
of
his
instructions
from
klüng
even
hoddy
got
at
least
part
of
it
why
that
means
that
anybody
can
bump
off
any
diplomat
he
does
like
he
began
that
is
only
part
of
it
ringo
thrombley
told
him
it
also
means
that
a
diplomat
instead
of
being
regarded
as
the
representative
of
his
own
government
becomes
in
effect
a
functionary
of
the
government
of
new
texas
why
all
sorts
of
complications
could
arise
it
certainly
would
impair
shall
we
say
the
principle
of
extraterritoriality
of
embassies
stonehenge
picked
it
up
and
it
would
practically
destroy
the
principle
of
diplomatic
immunity
migawd
hoddy
looked
around
nervously
as
though
he
could
already
hear
an
army
of
new
texas
rangers
each
with
a
warrant
for
hoddy
ringo
battering
at
the
gates
we
have
to
do
something
gomez
the
secretary
of
the
embassy
said
i
do
know
what
stonehenge
said
the
obvious
solution
would
be
of
course
to
bring
charges
against
those
bonney
boys
on
simple
murder
which
would
be
tried
in
an
ordinary
criminal
court
but
it
too
late
for
that
now
we
would
have
time
to
prevent
their
being
arraigned
in
this
political
justice
court
and
once
a
defendant
is
brought
into
court
on
this
planet
he
can
not
be
brought
into
court
again
for
the
same
act
not
the
same
the
same
i
had
been
thinking
about
this
and
i
was
ready
look
we
must
bring
those
bonney
brothers
to
trial
it
the
only
effective
way
of
demonstrating
to
the
public
the
simple
fact
that
ambassador
cumshaw
was
murdered
at
the
instigation
of
the
we
dare
not
allow
them
to
be
convicted
in
the
court
of
political
justice
for
the
reasons
already
stated
and
to
maintain
the
prestige
of
the
solar
league
we
dare
not
allow
them
to
go
unpunished
we
can
have
it
one
way
parros
said
and
maybe
we
can
have
it
two
ways
but
i
damned
if
i
can
see
how
we
can
have
it
all
three
ways
i
was
surprised
that
he
did
see
it
he
had
had
the
same
urgency
goading
him
which
had
forced
me
to
find
the
answer
it
was
an
answer
that
i
liked
but
i
was
in
the
position
where
i
had
no
choice
well
here
what
we
have
to
do
gentlemen
i
began
and
from
the
respectful
way
they
regarded
me
from
the
attention
they
were
giving
my
words
i
got
a
sudden
thrill
of
pride
for
the
first
time
since
my
scrambled
arrival
i
was
really
stephen
silk
chapter
viii
a
couple
of
new
texas
ranger
tanks
met
the
embassy
car
four
blocks
from
the
statehouse
and
convoyed
us
into
the
central
plaza
where
the
barbecue
had
been
held
on
the
friday
afternoon
that
i
had
arrived
on
new
texas
there
was
almost
as
dense
a
crowd
as
the
last
time
i
had
seen
the
place
but
they
were
quieter
to
the
extent
that
there
were
no
bands
and
no
shooting
no
cowbells
or
whistles
the
barbecue
pits
were
going
again
however
and
hawkers
were
pushing
or
propelling
their
little
wagons
about
vending
sandwiches
i
saw
a
half
a
dozen
big
teleview
screens
apparently
wired
from
the
courtroom
as
soon
as
the
embassy
car
and
its
escorting
tanks
reached
the
plaza
an
ovation
broke
out
i
was
cheered
with
the
of
new
texans
and
adjured
and
implored
not
to
let
them
get
away
with
it
there
was
a
veritable
army
of
rangers
on
guard
at
the
doors
of
the
courtroom
the
only
spectators
being
admitted
to
the
courtroom
seemed
to
be
prominent
citizens
with
enough
pull
to
secure
passes
inside
some
of
the
spectators
benches
had
been
removed
to
clear
the
front
of
the
room
in
the
cleared
space
there
was
one
bulky
shape
under
a
cloth
cover
that
seemed
to
be
the
and
another
shape
that
looked
like
a
gun
smaller
exhibits
including
a
were
piled
on
the
table
the
prosecution
table
was
already
occupied
colonel
hickock
who
waved
a
greeting
to
me
three
or
four
men
who
looked
like
ranchers
and
a
delegation
of
lawyers
samuel
goodham
parros
beside
me
whispered
indicating
a
big
man
with
white
hair
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
of
the
cut
that
had
been
fashionable
on
terra
years
ago
best
criminal
lawyer
on
the
planet
hickock
must
have
hired
him
there
was
quite
a
swarm
at
the
center
table
too
some
of
them
were
ranchers
a
couple
in
aggressively
shabby
workclothes
and
there
were
several
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
i
shook
hands
with
them
and
gathered
that
they
like
myself
were
worried
about
the
precedent
that
might
be
established
by
this
trial
while
i
was
introducing
hoddy
ringo
as
my
attaché
extraordinary
which
was
no
less
than
the
truth
the
defense
party
came
in
there
were
only
three
lawyers
a
little
fellow
whom
parros
pointed
out
as
clement
sidney
and
two
assistants
and
guarded
by
a
ranger
and
a
couple
of
the
three
defendants
switchblade
joe
abe
and
tom
bonney
there
was
probably
a
year
or
so
age
different
from
one
to
another
but
they
certainly
had
a
common
parentage
they
all
had
pale
eyes
and
narrow
faces
subnormal
and
probably
psychopathic
i
thought
abe
had
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
and
his
left
shoulder
in
a
plaster
cast
the
buzz
of
conversation
among
the
spectators
altered
its
tone
subtly
and
took
on
a
note
of
hostility
as
they
entered
and
seated
themselves
the
balcony
seemed
to
be
crowded
with
press
representatives
several
telecast
cameras
and
sound
pickups
had
been
rigged
to
cover
the
front
of
the
room
from
various
angles
a
feature
that
had
been
missing
from
the
trial
i
had
seen
with
gail
on
friday
then
the
judges
entered
from
a
door
behind
the
bench
which
must
have
opened
from
a
passageway
under
the
plaza
and
the
court
was
called
to
order
the
president
judge
was
the
same
nelson
who
had
presided
at
the
whately
trial
and
the
first
thing
on
the
agenda
seemed
to
be
the
selection
of
a
new
board
of
associate
judges
parros
explained
in
a
whisper
that
the
board
which
had
served
on
the
previous
trial
would
sit
until
that
could
be
done
a
slip
of
paper
was
drawn
from
a
box
and
a
name
was
called
a
man
sitting
on
one
of
the
front
rows
of
spectators
seats
got
up
and
came
forward
one
of
sidney
assistants
rummaged
through
a
card
file
he
had
in
front
of
him
and
handed
a
card
to
the
chief
of
the
defense
at
once
sidney
was
on
his
feet
challenged
for
cause
he
called
out
this
man
is
known
to
have
declared
in
conversation
at
the
bar
of
the
silver
peso
saloon
here
in
new
austin
that
these
three
boys
my
clients
ought
all
to
be
hanged
higher
than
haman
yes
i
said
that
the
venireman
declared
i
repeat
it
right
here
all
three
of
these
murdering
skunks
ought
to
be
hanged
higher
than
your
honor
sidney
almost
screamed
if
after
hearing
this
brazen
declaration
of
bigoted
class
hatred
against
my
clients
he
is
allowed
to
sit
on
that
bench
judge
nelson
pounded
with
his
gavel
you
do
have
to
instruct
me
in
my
judicial
duties
counselor
he
said
the
venireman
has
obviously
disqualified
himself
by
giving
evidence
of
prejudice
next
name
the
next
man
was
challenged
he
was
a
retired
operator
in
new
austin
and
had
once
expressed
the
opinion
that
bonneyville
and
everybody
in
it
ought
to
be
off
the
face
of
new
texas
this
sidney
seemed
to
have
gotten
the
name
of
everybody
likely
to
be
called
for
court
duty
and
had
something
on
each
one
of
them
because
he
went
on
like
that
all
morning
you
know
what
i
think
stonehenge
whispered
to
me
leaning
over
behind
parros
i
think
he
just
stalling
to
keep
the
court
in
session
until
the
fleet
gets
here
i
wish
we
could
get
hold
of
one
of
those
wrist
watches
i
can
get
you
one
before
evening
hoddy
offered
if
you
do
care
what
happens
to
the
mutt
that
wearin
it
better
not
i
decided
might
tip
them
off
to
what
we
suspect
and
we
do
really
need
one
sir
rodney
will
have
patrols
out
far
enough
to
get
warning
in
time

and

beside

your
honor
the
prosecution
wishes
subject
to
agreement
of
the
defense
to
enter
the
following
stipulations
to
wit
first
that
the
late
silas
cumshaw
was
a
practicing
politician
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
second
that
he
is
now
dead
and
came
to
his
death
in
the
manner
attested
to
by
the
coroner
of
sam
houston
continent
third
that
he
came
to
his
death
at
the
hands
of
the
defendants
here
present
in
all
my
planning
i
forgotten
that
i
could
let
those
stipulations
stand
without
protest
and
at
the
same
time
if
i
protested
the
characterization
of
cumshaw
as
a
practicing
politician
the
trial
could
easily
end
right
there
so
i
prayed
for
a
miracle
and
clement
sidney
promptly
obliged
me
defense
wo
stipulate
anything
he
barked
my
clients
here
are
victims
of
a
monstrous
conspiracy
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
silas
cumshaw
they
ought
never
to
have
been
arrested
or
brought
here
and
if
the
prosecution
wants
to
establish
anything
they
can
do
it
by
testimony
in
the
regular
and
lawful
way
this
practice
of
stipulation
is
only
one
of
the
many
devices
by
which
the
courts
of
this
planet
are
being
perverted
to
serve
the
corrupt
and
unjust
ends
of
a
gang
of
reactionary
landowners
judge
nelson
gavel
hit
the
bench
with
a
crack
like
a
rifle
shot
sidney
in
justice
to
your
clients
i
would
hate
to
force
them
to
change
lawyers
in
the
middle
of
their
trial
but
if
i
hear
another
remark
like
that
about
the
courts
of
new
texas
that
exactly
what
will
happen
because
you
be
in
jail
for
contempt
is
that
clear
mr
sidney
i
settled
back
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
which
got
me
i
noticed
curious
stares
from
my
fellow
ambassadors
i
disregarded
the
questions
in
their
glances
i
had
what
i
wanted
they
began
calling
up
the
witnesses
first
the
doctor
who
had
certified
ambassador
cumshaw
death
he
gave
a
concise
description
of
the
wounds
which
had
killed
my
predecessor
sidney
was
trying
to
make
something
out
of
the
fact
that
he
was
hickock
family
physician
and
consuming
more
time
when
i
got
up
your
honor
i
am
present
here
as
because
of
the
obvious
interest
which
the
government
of
the
solar
league
has
in
this
case
objection
sidney
yelled
please
state
it
nelson
invited
this
is
a
court
of
the
people
of
the
planet
of
new
texas
this
foreign
emissary
of
the
solar
league
sent
here
to
conspire
with
new
texan
traitors
to
the
end
that
new
texans
shall
be
reduced
to
a
supine
and
ravished
satrapy
of
the
empire
of
the
galaxy
judge
nelson
rapped
sharply
friends
of
the
court
are
defined
as
persons
having
a
proper
interest
in
the
case
as
this
case
arises
from
the
death
of
the
former
ambassador
of
the
solar
league
i
can
not
see
how
the
present
ambassador
and
his
staff
can
be
excluded
overruled
he
nodded
to
me
continue
mr
ambassador
as
i
understand
i
have
the
same
rights
of
of
witnesses
as
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
defense
is
that
correct
your
honor
it
was
so
i
turned
to
the
witness
i
suppose
doctor
that
you
have
had
quite
a
bit
of
experience
in
your
practice
with
gunshot
wounds
he
chuckled
mr
ambassador
it
is
cases
which
keep
the
practice
of
medicine
and
surgery
alive
on
this
planet
yes
i
definitely
have
now
you
say
that
the
deceased
was
hit
by
six
different
projectiles
right
shoulder
almost
completely
severed
right
lung
and
right
ribs
blown
out
of
the
chest
spleen
and
kidneys
so
intermingled
as
to
be
practically
one
and
left
leg
severed
by
complete
shattering
of
the
left
pelvis
and
that
right
i
picked
up
the
it
weighed
a
good
sixty
pounds
from
the
table
and
asked
him
if
this
weapon
could
have
inflicted
such
wounds
he
agreed
that
it
both
could
and
had
this
the
usual
type
of
weapon
used
in
your
new
texas
political
liquidations
i
asked
certainly
not
the
usual
weapons
are
pistols
sometimes
a
or
a
shotgun
i
asked
the
same
question
when
i
the
ballistics
witness
is
this
the
usual
type
of
weapon
used
in
your
new
texas
political
liquidations
no
not
at
all
that
a
very
expensive
weapon
mr
ambassador
even
manufactured
on
this
planet
made
by
the
a
weapon
like
that
sells
for
five
six
hundred
pesos
it
used
for
shooting
really
big
game
supermastodon
and
things
like
that
and
of
course
for
combat
it
seems
i
remarked
that
the
defense
is
overlooking
an
obvious
point
there
i
doubt
if
these
three
defendants
ever
in
all
their
lives
had
among
them
the
price
of
such
a
weapon
that
of
course
brought
sidney
to
his
feet
sputtering
objections
to
this
attempt
to
disparage
the
honest
poverty
of
his
clients
which
only
helped
to
call
attention
to
the
point
then
the
prosecution
called
in
a
witness
named
david
crockett
longfellow
i
met
him
at
the
hickock
ranch
he
was
hickock
butler
he
limped
from
an
old
injury
which
had
retired
him
from
work
on
the
range
he
was
sworn
in
and
testified
to
his
name
and
occupation
do
you
know
these
three
defendants
goodham
asked
him
yeah
i
even
marked
one
of
them
for
future
identification
longfellow
replied
sidney
was
up
at
once
shouting
objections
after
he
was
quieted
down
goodham
remarked
that
he
come
to
that
point
later
and
began
a
line
of
questioning
to
establish
that
longfellow
had
been
on
the
hickock
ranch
on
the
day
when
silas
cumshaw
was
killed
now
goodham
said
will
you
relate
to
the
court
the
matters
of
interest
which
came
to
your
personal
observation
on
that
day
longfellow
began
his
story
at
about
i
was
dustin
up
and
straightenin
things
in
the
library
while
the
colonel
was
at
his
desk
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
to
me
suppose
you
call
the
solar
embassy
and
see
if
cumshaw
is
doin
anything
today
if
he
is
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
come
out
i
was
workin
right
beside
the
telescreen
so
i
called
the
solar
league
embassy
thrombley
took
the
call
and
i
asked
him
was
cumshaw
around
by
this
time
the
colonel
got
through
with
what
he
was
doin
at
the
desk
and
came
over
to
the
screen
i
went
back
to
my
work
but
i
heard
the
colonel
cumshaw
could
he
come
out
for
the
day
an
cumshaw
sayin
yes
he
could
he
be
out
by
about
well
about
his
came
in
and
landed
on
the
drive
little
job
that
he
drove
himself
he
landed
it
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
outside
veranda
like
he
usually
did
and
got
out
then
this
other
car
came
droppin
in
from
outa
nowhere
i
did
pay
it
much
attention
thought
it
might
be
one
of
the
other
ambassadors
that
cumshaw
brung
along
but
cumshaw
turned
around
and
looked
at
it
and
then
he
started
to
run
for
the
veranda
i
was
standin
in
the
doorway
when
i
seen
him
startin
to
run
i
jumped
out
on
the
porch
and
pulled
my
gun
and
then
this
begun
outa
the
other
car
there
was
only
eight
or
ten
shots
fired
from
this
car
but
most
of
them
hit
mr
cumshaw
goodham
waited
a
few
moments
longfellow
voice
had
choked
and
there
was
a
twitching
about
his
face
as
though
he
were
trying
to
suppress
tears
now
longfellow
goodham
said
did
you
recognize
the
people
who
were
in
the
car
from
which
the
shots
came
yeah
like
i
said
i
cut
a
mark
on
one
of
them
that
one
there
abe
bonney
he
was
handlin
the
gun
and
from
where
i
was
he
had
his
left
side
to
me
i
was
tryin
for
his
head
but
i
always
overshoot
so
i
have
the
habit
of
holdin
low
this
time
i
held
too
low
he
looked
at
in
coldly
poisonous
hatred
i
be
sorry
about
that
as
long
as
i
live
and
who
else
was
in
the
car
the
other
two
curs
outa
the
same
litter
switchblade
over
there
further
questioning
revealed
that
longfellow
had
had
no
direct
knowledge
of
the
pursuit
or
the
siege
of
the
jail
in
bonneyville
colonel
hickock
had
taken
personal
command
of
that
and
had
left
longfellow
behind
to
call
the
solar
league
embassy
and
the
rangers
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
move
the
body
but
had
left
it
lying
in
the
driveway
until
the
doctor
and
the
rangers
arrived
goodham
went
to
the
middle
table
and
picked
up
a
heavy
automatic
pistol
i
call
the
court
attention
to
this
pistol
it
is
an
automatic
manufactured
by
the
colt
firearms
company
of
new
texas
a
licensed
subsidiary
of
the
colt
firearms
company
of
terra
he
handed
it
to
longfellow
do
you
know
this
pistol
he
asked
longfellow
was
almost
insulted
by
the
question
of
course
he
knew
his
own
pistol
he
recited
the
serial
number
and
pointed
to
different
scars
and
scratches
on
the
weapon
telling
how
they
had
been
acquired
the
court
accepts
that
longfellow
knows
his
own
weapon
nelson
said
i
assume
that
this
is
the
weapon
with
which
you
claim
to
have
shot
abe
bonney
it
was
although
longfellow
resented
the
qualification
that
all
your
witness
sidney
goodham
said
sidney
began
an
immediate
attack
questioning
longfellow
eyesight
intelligence
honesty
and
integrity
he
tried
to
show
personal
enmity
toward
the
bonneys
he
implied
that
longfellow
had
been
conspiring
with
cumshaw
to
bring
about
the
conquest
of
new
texas
by
the
solar
league
the
verbal
exchange
became
so
heated
that
both
witness
and
attorney
had
to
be
admonished
repeatedly
from
the
bench
but
at
no
point
did
sidney
shake
longfellow
from
his
one
fundamental
statement
that
the
bonney
brothers
had
shot
silas
cumshaw
and
that
he
had
shot
abe
bonney
in
the
shoulder
when
he
was
finished
i
got
up
and
took
over
longfellow
you
say
that
thrombley
answered
the
screen
at
the
solar
league
embassy
i
began
you
know
mr
thrombley
sure
mr
silk
he
been
out
at
the
ranch
with
cumshaw
a
lotta
times
well
beside
yourself
and
colonel
hickock
and
cumshaw
and
possibly
thrombley
who
else
knew
that
cumshaw
would
be
at
the
ranch
at
on
that
morning
nobody
but
the
aircar
had
obviously
been
waiting
for
cumshaw
the
bonneys
must
have
had
advance
knowledge
my
questions
made
that
point
clear
despite
the
obvious
and
reluctantly
objections
from
sidney
that
will
be
all
longfellow
thank
you
any
questions
from
anybody
else
there
being
none
longfellow
stepped
down
it
was
then
a
few
minutes
before
noon
so
judge
nelson
recessed
court
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
afternoon
the
surgeon
who
had
treated
abe
wounded
shoulder
testified
identifying
the
bullet
which
had
been
extracted
from
bonney
shoulder
a
ballistics
man
from
ranger
followed
him
to
the
stand
and
testified
that
it
had
been
fired
from
longfellow
colt
then
ranger
captain
nelson
took
the
stand
his
testimony
was
about
what
he
had
given
me
at
the
embassy
with
the
exception
that
the
bonneys
admission
that
they
had
shot
ambassador
cumshaw
was
ruled
out
as
having
been
made
under
duress
however
captain
nelson
testimony
did
need
the
confessions
the
cover
was
stripped
off
the
and
a
couple
of
men
with
a
dragged
it
out
in
front
of
the
bench
the
ranger
captain
identified
it
as
the
car
which
he
had
found
at
the
bonneyville
jail
he
went
over
it
with
an
flashlight
and
showed
where
he
had
written
his
name
and
the
date
on
it
with
fluorescent
ink
the
effects
of
were
plainly
evident
on
it
then
the
other
shrouded
object
was
unveiled
and
identified
as
the
gun
which
had
disabled
the
colonel
hickock
identified
the
gun
as
the
one
with
which
he
had
fired
on
the
finally
the
ballistics
expert
was
brought
back
to
the
stand
again
to
link
the
two
by
means
of
fragments
found
in
the
car
then
goodham
brought
sam
bonney
to
the
stand
the
mayor
of
bonneyville
was
a
man
of
fifty
or
so
short
partially
bald
dressed
in
faded
blue
levis
a
frayed
white
shirt
and
a
vest
there
was
absolutely
no
mystery
about
how
he
had
acquired
his
nickname
he
disgorged
a
cud
of
tobacco
into
a
spittoon
took
the
oath
with
unctuous
solemnity
then
reloaded
himself
with
another
chew
and
told
his
version
of
the
attack
on
the
jail
at
about
on
the
day
in
question
he
testified
he
had
been
in
his
office
hard
at
work
in
the
public
service
when
an
partially
disabled
by
gunfire
had
landed
in
the
street
outside
and
the
three
defendants
had
rushed
in
claiming
sanctuary
from
then
on
the
story
flowed
along
smoothly
following
the
lines
predicted
by
captain
nelson
and
parros
of
course
he
had
given
the
fugitives
shelter
they
had
claimed
to
have
been
near
to
a
political
assassination
and
were
in
fear
of
their
lives
under
sidney
and
coaching
he
poured
out
the
story
of
bonneyville
wrongs
at
the
hands
of
the
reactionary
landowners
and
the
atrocious
behavior
of
the
hickock
finally
after
extracting
the
last
drop
of
venom
out
of
him
sidney
turned
him
over
to
me
how
many
men
were
inside
the
jail
when
the
three
defendants
came
claiming
sanctuary
i
asked
he
could
rightly
say
maybe
four
or
five
closer
according
to
the
rangers
how
many
of
them
were
prisoners
in
the
jail
well
none
the
prisoners
was
all
turned
out
that
mornin
they
was
just
common
drunks
disorderly
conduct
cases
that
kinda
thing
we
turned
them
out
so
we
could
make
some
repairs
you
turned
them
out
because
you
expected
to
have
to
defend
the
jail
because
you
knew
in
advance
that
these
three
would
be
along
claiming
sanctuary
and
that
colonel
hickock
ranch
hands
would
be
right
on
their
heels
did
you
i
demanded
it
took
a
good
five
minutes
before
sidney
stopped
shouting
long
enough
for
judge
nelson
to
sustain
the
objection
you
knew
these
young
men
all
their
lives
i
take
it
what
did
you
know
about
their
financial
circumstances
for
instance
well
they
been
ground
down
an
kept
poor
by
the
big
ranchers
the
then
were
you
surprised
to
see
them
driving
such
an
expensive
aircar
i
do
know
as
it
such
an
expensive
he
shut
his
mouth
suddenly
you
know
where
they
got
the
money
to
buy
that
car
i
pressed
sam
did
answer
from
the
man
who
paid
them
to
murder
ambassador
silas
cumshaw
i
kept
pressing
do
you
know
how
much
they
were
paid
for
that
job
do
you
know
where
the
money
came
from
do
you
know
who
the
was
and
how
much
he
got
and
how
much
he
kept
for
himself
was
it
the
same
source
that
paid
for
the
recent
attempt
on
president
hutchinson
life
i
refuse
to
answer
the
witness
declared
trying
to
shove
his
chest
out
about
half
as
far
as
his
midriff
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
incriminate
or
degrade
me
you
ca
degrade
a
bonney
a
voice
from
the
balcony
put
in
so
then
i
replied
to
the
voice
what
he
means
is
incriminate
i
turned
to
the
witness
that
will
be
all
excused
as
bonney
left
the
stand
and
was
led
out
the
side
door
goodham
addressed
the
bench
now
your
honor
he
said
i
believe
that
the
prosecution
has
succeeded
in
definitely
establishing
that
these
three
defendants
actually
did
fire
the
shot
which
on
april
deprived
silas
cumshaw
of
his
life
we
will
now
undertake
to
prove
followed
a
long
succession
of
witnesses
each
testifying
to
some
public
or
private
act
of
philanthropy
some
noble
trait
of
character
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
which
the
defense
lawyer
in
the
whately
case
had
been
so
willing
to
stipulate
sidney
of
course
tried
to
make
it
all
out
to
be
part
of
a
sinister
conspiracy
to
establish
a
solar
league
fifth
column
on
new
texas
finally
the
prosecution
rested
its
case
i
entertained
gail
and
her
father
at
the
embassy
that
evening
the
street
outside
was
crowded
with
new
texans
all
of
them
on
our
side
shouting
slogans
like
death
to
the
bonneys
and
vengeance
for
cumshaw
and
annexation
now
some
of
it
was
entirely
spontaneous
too
the
hickocks
father
and
daughter
were
given
a
tremendous
ovation
when
they
finally
left
and
followed
to
their
hotel
by
cheering
crowds
i
saw
one
big
banner
lettered
let
new
texas
go
to
the
dogs
and
bearing
a
crude
picture
of
a
i
seemed
to
recall
having
seen
a
couple
of
our
marines
making
that
banner
the
evening
before
in
the
embassy
patio
but
chapter
x
the
next
morning
the
third
of
the
trial
opened
with
the
defense
witnesses
for
the
three
killers
and
witnesses
to
the
political
iniquities
of
silas
cumshaw
neither
goodham
nor
i
bothered
to
the
former
i
see
how
any
lawyer
as
shrewd
as
sidney
had
shown
himself
to
be
would
even
dream
of
getting
such
an
array
of
thugs
cutthroats
sluts
and
slatterns
into
court
as
character
witnesses
for
anybody
the
latter
on
the
other
hand
we
went
after
unmercifully
revealing
under
their
enmity
for
cumshaw
a
small
hard
core
of
bigoted
xenophobia
and
selfish
fear
goodham
did
a
beautiful
job
on
that
he
seemed
able
at
a
glance
to
divine
exactly
what
each
witness
motivation
was
and
able
to
make
him
or
her
betray
that
motivation
in
its
least
admirable
terms
finally
the
defense
rested
about
a
before
noon
i
rose
and
addressed
the
court
your
honor
while
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
have
done
an
admirable
job
in
bringing
out
the
essential
facts
of
how
my
predecessor
met
his
death
there
are
many
features
about
this
case
which
are
far
from
clear
to
me
they
will
be
even
less
clear
to
my
government
which
is
composed
of
men
who
have
never
set
foot
on
this
planet
for
this
reason
i
wish
to
call
or
recall
certain
witnesses
to
clarify
these
points
sidney
who
had
begun
shouting
objections
as
soon
as
i
had
gotten
to
my
feet
finally
managed
to
get
himself
recognized
by
the
court
this
solar
league
ambassador
your
honor
is
simply
trying
to
use
the
courts
of
the
planet
of
new
texas
as
a
for
his
imperialistic
government
propaganda
you
may
reassure
yourself
sidney
judge
nelson
said
this
court
will
not
allow
itself
to
be
improperly
used
or
improperly
swayed
by
the
ambassador
of
the
solar
league
this
court
is
interested
only
in
determining
the
facts
regarding
the
case
before
it
you
may
call
your
witnesses
mr
ambassador
he
glanced
at
his
watch
court
will
now
recess
for
an
hour
and
a
half
can
you
have
them
here
by
i
assured
him
i
could
after
glancing
across
the
room
at
ranger
captain
nelson
and
catching
his
nod
my
first
witness
that
afternoon
was
thrombley
after
the
formalities
of
getting
his
name
and
connection
with
the
solar
league
embassy
on
the
record
i
asked
him
thrombley
did
you
on
the
morning
of
april
receive
a
call
from
the
hickock
ranch
for
mr
cumshaw
yes
indeed
mr
ambassador
the
call
was
from
longfellow
colonel
hickock
butler
he
asked
if
cumshaw
were
available
it
happened
that
cumshaw
was
in
the
same
room
with
me
and
he
came
directly
to
the
screen
then
colonel
hickock
appeared
in
the
screen
and
inquired
if
cumshaw
could
come
out
to
the
ranch
for
the
day
he
said
something
about
superdove
shooting
you
heard
cumshaw
tell
colonel
hickock
that
he
would
be
out
at
the
ranch
at
about
thrombley
said
he
had
and
to
your
knowledge
did
anybody
else
at
the
embassy
hear
that
oh
no
sir
we
were
in
the
ambassador
private
office
and
the
screen
there
is
and
what
other
calls
did
you
receive
prior
to
cumshaw
death
about
fifteen
minutes
after
cumshaw
had
left
the
ambassador
called
about
a
personal
matter
as
he
was
most
anxious
to
contact
cumshaw
i
told
him
where
he
had
gone
then
to
your
knowledge
outside
of
yourself
colonel
hickock
and
his
butler
the
ambassador
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
known
that
cumshaw
car
would
be
landing
on
colonel
hickock
drive
at
or
about
is
that
correct
yes
plus
anybody
whom
the
ambassador
might
have
told
exactly
i
pounced
then
i
turned
and
gave
the
three
bonney
brothers
a
sweeping
glance
plus
anybody
the
ambassador
might
have
told
that
all
your
witness
mr
sidney
sidney
got
up
started
toward
the
witness
stand
and
then
thought
better
of
it
no
questions
he
said
the
next
witness
was
a
james
finnegan
he
was
identified
as
cashier
of
the
crooked
creek
national
bank
i
asked
him
if
sam
bonney
did
business
at
his
bank
he
said
yes
anything
unusual
about
mayor
bonney
account
i
asked
well
it
been
unusually
active
lately
ordinarily
he
carries
around
thousand
pesos
but
about
the
first
of
april
that
took
a
big
jump
quite
a
big
jump
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pesos
all
in
a
lump
when
did
sam
deposit
this
large
sum
i
asked
he
did
the
money
came
to
us
in
a
cashier
check
on
the
trust
company
of
new
austin
with
an
anonymous
letter
asking
that
it
be
deposited
to
mayor
bonney
account
the
letter
was
typed
on
a
sheet
of
yellow
paper
in
basic
english
do
you
have
that
letter
now
i
asked
no
i
do
after
we
recorded
the
new
balance
came
storming
in
raising
hell
because
we
recorded
it
he
told
me
that
if
we
ever
got
another
deposit
like
that
we
were
to
turn
it
over
to
him
in
cash
then
he
wanted
to
see
the
letter
and
when
i
gave
it
to
him
he
took
it
over
to
a
telescreen
booth
and
drew
the
curtains
i
got
a
little
busy
with
some
other
matters
and
the
next
time
i
looked
was
gone
and
some
girl
was
using
the
booth
that
very
interesting
finnegan
was
that
the
last
of
your
unusual
business
with
mayor
bonney
oh
no
then
about
two
weeks
before
cumshaw
was
killed
came
in
and
wanted
pesos
in
a
big
hurry
in
small
bills
i
gave
it
to
him
and
he
grabbed
at
the
money
like
a
starved
dog
at
a
bone
and
upset
a
bottle
of
red
the
sort
we
use
to
refill
our
bank
seals
three
of
the
bills
got
splashed
i
offered
to
exchange
them
but
he
said
with
it
i
in
a
hurry
and
went
out
the
next
day
switchblade
joe
bonney
came
in
to
make
payment
on
a
note
we
were
holding
on
him
he
used
those
three
bills
in
the
payment
then
about
a
week
ago
there
was
another
cashier
check
came
in
for
this
time
there
was
no
letter
just
one
of
our
regular
no
name
of
depositor
i
held
the
check
and
gave
it
to
i
remember
when
it
came
in
i
said
to
one
of
the
clerks
i
wonder
who
going
to
get
bumped
off
this
time
and
sure
enough
sidney
yell
of
objection
was
all
his
previous
objections
gathered
into
one
you
say
the
letter
accompanying
the
first
deposit
the
one
in
basic
english
was
apparently
taken
away
by
sam
bonney
if
you
saw
another
letter
of
the
same
sort
would
you
be
able
to
say
whether
or
not
it
might
be
like
the
one
you
mentioned
sidney
vociferating
more
objections
i
was
trying
to
get
expert
testimony
without
previous
qualification
not
at
all
sidney
judge
nelson
ruled
mr
silk
has
merely
asked
if
finnegan
could
say
whether
one
document
bore
any
resemblance
to
another
i
asked
permission
to
have
another
witness
sworn
in
while
finnegan
was
still
on
the
stand
and
called
in
a
boone
the
cashier
of
the
packers
and
brokers
trust
company
of
new
austin
he
had
with
him
a
letter
typed
on
yellow
paper
which
he
said
had
accompanied
an
anonymous
deposit
of
two
hundred
thousand
pesos
finnegan
said
that
it
was
exactly
like
the
one
he
had
received
in
typing
grammar
and
wording
all
but
the
name
of
the
person
to
whose
account
the
money
was
to
be
deposited
and
whose
account
received
this
anonymous
benefaction
mr
boone
i
asked
the
account
boone
replied
of
clement
sidney
i
was
surprised
that
judge
nelson
did
break
the
handle
of
his
gavel
after
that
finally
after
a
couple
of
threats
to
clear
the
court
order
was
restored
sidney
had
no
questions
to
ask
this
time
either
the
bailiff
looked
at
the
next
slip
of
paper
i
gave
him
frowned
over
it
and
finally
asked
the
court
for
assistance
i
ca
pronounce
thing
at
all
he
complained
one
of
the
judges
finally
got
out
a
mouthful
of
growls
and
yaps
and
gave
it
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
copy
into
the
record
the
next
witness
was
a
and
in
the
new
texan
garb
he
was
wearing
he
was
something
to
open
my
eyes
even
after
years
on
the
hooligan
diplomats
after
he
took
the
stand
the
clerk
of
the
court
looked
at
him
blankly
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
judge
nelson
your
honor
how
am
i
gon
na
go
about
swearing
him
in
he
asked
what
does
a
swear
by
that
binding
the
president
judge
frowned
for
a
moment
does
anybody
here
know
basic
well
enough
to
translate
the
oath
he
asked
i
think
i
can
i
offered
i
spent
a
great
many
years
in
our
consular
service
before
i
was
sent
here
we
use
basic
with
a
great
many
alien
peoples
administer
the
oath
then
nelson
told
me
put
up
right
hand
i
told
the
do
you
truly
say
in
front
of
great
one
who
made
all
worlds
who
has
knowledge
of
what
is
in
the
hearts
of
all
persons
that
what
you
will
say
here
will
be
true
all
true
and
not
anything
that
is
not
true
and
will
you
so
say
again
at
time
when
all
worlds
end
do
you
so
truly
say
yes
i
so
truly
say
say
your
name
ppmegll
kkuvtmmecc
cicici
what
is
your
business
i
put
things
made
of
cloth
into
this
world
and
i
take
meat
out
of
this
world
where
do
you
have
your
house
here
in
new
austin
over
my
house
of
business
on
coronado
street
what
people
do
you
see
in
this
place
that
you
have
made
business
with
ppmegll
kkuvtmmecc
cicici
pointed
a
hand
at
the
bonney
brothers
what
business
did
you
make
with
them
i
gave
them
for
money
a
machine
which
goes
on
the
ground
and
goes
in
the
air
very
fast
to
take
persons
and
things
about
is
that
the
thing
you
gave
them
for
money
i
asked
pointing
at
the
exhibit
yes
but
it
was
new
then
it
has
been
made
broken
by
things
from
guns
now
what
money
did
they
give
you
for
the
machine
one
hundred
pesos
that
started
another
uproar
there
was
a
soul
in
that
courtroom
who
did
know
that
five
thousand
pesos
would
have
been
a
bargain
price
for
that
car
mr
ambassador
one
of
the
associate
judges
interrupted
i
used
to
be
in
the
business
am
i
expected
to
believe
that
this
this
being
sold
that
for
a
hundred
pesos
here
a
notarized
copy
of
the
bill
of
sale
from
the
office
of
the
vehicles
registration
bureau
i
said
i
introduce
it
as
evidence
there
was
a
disturbance
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
then
the
ambassador
gglafrr
ddespttann
vuvuvu
came
stalking
down
the
aisle
followed
by
a
couple
of
rangers
and
two
of
his
attachés
he
came
forward
and
addressed
the
court
may
you
be
happy
sir
but
i
am
in
here
so
quickly
not
because
i
have
desire
to
make
noise
but
because
it
is
only
short
time
since
it
got
in
my
knowledge
that
one
of
my
persons
is
in
this
place
i
am
here
to
be
of
help
to
him
that
he
not
get
in
trouble
and
to
be
of
help
to
you
the
name
for
what
i
am
to
do
in
this
place
is
not
part
of
my
knowledge
please
say
it
for
me
you
are
a
friend
of
the
court
judge
nelson
told
him
an
you
make
me
happy
please
go
on
i
have
no
desire
to
put
stop
to
what
you
do
in
this
place
from
what
person
did
you
get
this
machine
that
you
gave
to
these
persons
for
one
hundred
pesos
i
asked
gglafrr
immediately
began
barking
and
snarling
and
yelping
at
my
witness
the
drygoods
importer
looked
startled
and
judge
nelson
banged
with
his
gavel
that
enough
of
that
there
be
nothing
spoken
in
this
court
but
english
except
through
an
interpreter
yow
i
am
sad
that
what
i
did
was
not
right
the
ambassador
replied
contritely
but
my
person
here
has
not
as
part
of
his
knowledge
that
you
will
make
him
say
what
may
put
him
in
trouble
nelson
nodded
in
agreement
you
are
right
this
person
who
is
here
has
no
need
to
make
answer
to
any
question
if
it
may
put
him
in
trouble
or
make
him
seem
less
than
he
is
i
will
not
make
answer
the
witness
said
no
further
questions
i
turned
to
goodham
and
then
to
sidney
they
had
no
questions
either
i
handed
another
slip
of
paper
to
the
bailiff
and
another
named
bbrarkk
jjoknyyegg
kekeke
took
the
stand
he
put
into
this
world
things
for
small
persons
to
make
amusement
with
he
took
out
of
this
world
meat
and
leather
he
had
his
house
of
business
in
new
austin
and
he
pointed
out
the
three
bonneys
as
persons
in
this
place
that
he
saw
that
he
had
seen
before
and
what
business
did
you
make
with
them
i
asked
i
gave
them
for
money
a
gun
which
sends
out
things
of
very
fast
to
make
death
or
hurt
come
to
men
and
animals
and
does
destruction
to
machines
and
things
is
this
the
gun
i
showed
it
to
him
it
could
be
the
gun
was
made
in
my
world
many
guns
like
it
are
made
there
i
am
certain
that
this
is
the
very
gun
i
had
a
notarized
copy
of
a
customs
house
bill
in
which
the
gun
was
described
and
specified
by
serial
number
i
introduced
it
as
evidence
how
much
money
did
these
three
persons
give
you
for
this
gun
i
asked
five
pesos
the
customs
appraisal
on
this
gun
is
six
hundred
pesos
i
mentioned
immediately
ambassador
vuvuvu
was
on
his
feet
my
person
here
has
not
as
part
of
his
knowledge
that
he
may
put
himself
in
trouble
by
what
he
says
to
answer
these
questions
that
put
a
stop
to
that
bbrarkk
jjoknyyegg
kekeke
immediately
took
refuge
in
refusal
to
answer
on
grounds
of
that
is
all
your
honor
i
said
and
now
i
continued
when
the
witness
had
left
the
stand
i
have
something
further
to
present
to
the
court
speaking
both
as
and
as
ambassador
of
the
solar
league
this
court
can
not
convict
the
three
men
who
are
here
on
trial
these
men
should
have
never
been
brought
to
trial
in
this
court
it
has
no
jurisdiction
over
this
case
this
was
a
simple
case
of
murder
by
hired
assassins
committed
against
the
ambassador
of
one
government
at
the
instigation
of
another
not
an
act
of
political
protest
within
the
meaning
of
new
texan
law
there
was
a
brief
silence
both
the
court
and
the
spectators
were
stunned
and
most
stunned
of
all
were
the
three
bonney
brothers
who
had
been
watching
while
i
had
been
putting
a
rope
around
their
necks
the
uproar
from
the
rear
of
the
courtroom
gave
judge
nelson
a
needed
minute
or
so
to
collect
his
thoughts
after
he
had
gotten
order
restored
he
turned
to
me
ambassador
silk
will
you
please
elaborate
on
the
extraordinary
statement
you
have
just
made
he
invited
as
though
every
word
had
sharp
corners
that
were
sticking
in
his
throat
gladly
your
honor
my
words
too
were
gouging
and
scraping
my
throat
as
they
came
out
i
could
feel
my
knees
getting
absurdly
weak
and
my
mouth
tasted
as
though
i
had
an
old
copper
penny
in
it
as
i
understand
it
the
laws
of
new
texas
do
not
extend
their
ordinary
protection
to
persons
engaged
in
the
practice
of
politics
an
act
of
personal
injury
against
a
politician
is
considered
criminal
only
to
the
extent
that
the
politician
injured
has
not
by
his
public
acts
deserved
the
degree
of
severity
with
which
he
has
been
injured
and
the
court
of
political
justice
is
established
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
such
an
excess
of
severity
in
the
treatment
meted
out
by
the
accused
to
the
injured
or
deceased
politician
this
gives
rise
of
course
to
some
interesting
practices
for
instance
what
is
at
law
a
trial
of
the
accused
is
in
substance
a
trial
of
his
victim
but
in
any
case
tried
in
this
court
the
accused
must
be
a
person
who
has
injured
or
killed
a
man
who
is
definable
as
a
practicing
politician
under
the
government
of
new
texas
speaking
for
my
government
i
must
deny
that
these
men
should
have
been
tried
in
this
court
for
the
murder
of
silas
cumshaw
to
do
otherwise
would
establish
the
principle
and
precedent
that
our
ambassador
or
any
other
ambassador
here
is
a
practicing
politician
under
mark
that
well
your
honor
under
the
laws
and
government
of
new
texas
this
would
not
only
make
of
any
ambassador
a
permissable
target
for
any
marksman
who
happened
to
disapprove
of
the
policies
of
another
government
but
more
serious
it
would
place
the
ambassador
and
his
government
in
a
subordinate
position
relative
to
the
government
of
new
texas
this
the
government
of
the
solar
league
simply
can
not
tolerate
for
reasons
which
it
would
be
insulting
to
the
intelligence
of
this
court
to
enumerate
mr
silk
judge
nelson
said
gravely
this
court
takes
full
cognizance
of
the
force
of
your
arguments
however
i
like
to
know
why
you
permitted
this
trial
to
run
to
this
length
before
entering
this
objection
surely
you
could
have
made
clear
the
position
of
your
government
at
the
beginning
of
this
trial
your
honor
i
said
had
i
done
so
these
defendants
would
have
been
released
and
the
facts
behind
their
crime
would
have
never
come
to
light
i
grant
that
the
important
function
of
this
court
is
to
determine
questions
of
relative
guilt
and
innocence
we
must
not
lose
sight
however
of
the
fact
that
the
primary
function
of
any
court
is
to
determine
the
truth
and
only
by
the
process
of
the
trial
of
these
depraved
could
the
real
author
of
the
crime
be
uncovered
this
was
important
both
for
the
government
of
the
solar
league
and
the
government
of
new
texas
my
government
now
knows
who
procured
the
death
of
silas
cumshaw
and
we
will
take
appropriate
action
the
government
of
new
texas
has
now
had
spelled
out
in
letters
anyone
can
read
the
fact
that
this
beautiful
planet
is
in
truth
a
awareness
of
this
may
save
new
texas
from
being
the
scene
of
a
larger
and
more
destructive
battle
new
texas
also
knows
who
are
its
enemies
and
who
can
be
counted
upon
to
stand
as
its
friends
yes
mr
silk
vuvuvu
i
have
heard
any
comment
from
you
no
comment
well
we
have
to
close
the
court
to
consider
this
phase
of
the
question
the
black
screen
slid
up
for
the
second
time
during
the
trial
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
the
room
became
a
bubbling
pot
of
sound
at
least
six
fights
broke
out
among
the
spectators
within
three
minutes
the
rangers
and
court
bailiffs
were
busy
restoring
order
gail
hickock
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
front
row
of
the
seats
came
running
up
while
i
was
still
receiving
the
congratulations
of
my
fellow
diplomats
stephen
how
you
she
demanded
you
know
what
you
done
you
gotten
those
murdering
snakes
turned
loose
andrew
jackson
hickock
left
the
prosecution
table
and
approached
mr
silk
you
just
secured
the
freedom
of
three
men
who
murdered
one
of
my
best
friends
colonel
hickock
i
believe
i
knew
silas
cumshaw
before
you
did
he
was
one
of
my
instructors
at
dumbarton
oaks
and
i
have
always
had
the
deepest
respect
and
admiration
for
him
but
he
taught
me
one
thing
which
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
since
you
expatriated
yourself
that
in
the
diplomatic
service
personal
feelings
do
count
the
only
thing
of
importance
is
the
advancement
of
the
policies
of
the
solar
league
silas
and
i
were
attachés
together
at
the
old
embassy
at
drammool
on
altair
ii
colonel
hickock
said
what
else
he
might
have
said
was
lost
in
the
sudden
exclamation
as
the
black
screen
slid
down
in
front
of
judge
nelson
i
saw
there
were
three
and
three
pairs
of
automatics
switchblade
joe
bonney
abe
bonney
tom
bonney
together
with
your
counsel
approach
the
court
and
hear
the
verdict
judge
nelson
said
the
three
defendants
and
their
lawyer
rose
the
bonneys
were
swaggering
and
laughing
but
for
a
lawyer
whose
clients
had
just
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
sidney
was
looking
remarkably
unhappy
he
probably
had
imagination
enough
to
see
what
would
be
waiting
for
him
outside
it
pains
me
inexpressibly
judge
nelson
said
to
inform
you
three
that
this
court
can
not
convict
you
of
the
cowardly
murder
of
that
learned
and
honorable
old
man
silas
cumshaw
nor
can
you
be
brought
to
trial
in
any
other
court
on
new
texas
again
for
that
dastardly
crime
here
are
your
weapons
which
must
be
returned
to
you
sort
them
out
yourselves
because
i
wo
dirty
my
fingers
on
them
and
may
you
regret
and
feel
shame
for
your
despicable
act
as
long
as
you
live
which
i
hope
wo
be
more
than
a
few
hours
with
that
he
used
the
end
of
his
gavel
to
push
the
three
belts
off
the
bench
and
onto
the
floor
at
the
bonneys
feet
they
stood
laughing
at
him
for
a
few
moments
then
stopped
picked
the
belts
up
drew
the
pistols
to
check
magazines
and
chambers
and
then
began
slapping
each
others
backs
and
shouting
jubilant
congratulations
at
one
another
sidney
two
assistants
and
some
of
his
friends
came
up
and
began
pumping
sidney
hands
there
gail
flung
at
me
now
look
at
your
masterpiece
why
do
you
go
up
and
congratulate
him
too
and
with
that
she
slapped
me
across
the
face
it
hurt
like
the
devil
she
was
a
lot
stronger
than
i
expected
in
about
two
minutes
i
told
her
you
can
apologize
to
me
for
that
or
weep
over
my
corpse
right
now
though
you
better
be
getting
behind
something
solid
chapter
xi
i
turned
and
stepped
forward
to
confront
the
bonneys
mentally
thanking
gail
up
until
she
slapped
me
i
been
and
with
what
i
had
to
do
now
i
was
just
plain
angry
and
i
found
that
i
was
thinking
a
lot
more
clearly
bonney
wounded
left
shoulder
i
knew
would
keep
him
from
using
his
gun
hand
but
his
shoulder
muscles
would
be
stiff
enough
to
slow
his
draw
i
intended
saving
him
until
i
dealt
with
his
brothers
now
i
remembered
how
gotten
that
wound
in
the
first
place
he
been
the
one
who
used
the
out
at
the
hickock
ranch
so
i
changed
my
plans
and
moved
him
up
to
top
priority
hold
it
i
yelled
at
them
you
been
cleared
of
killing
a
politician
but
you
still
have
killing
a
solar
league
ambassador
to
answer
for
now
get
your
hands
full
of
guns
if
you
do
want
to
die
with
them
empty
the
crowd
of
sympathizers
and
felicitators
simply
exploded
away
from
the
bonney
brothers
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
sidney
and
a
fat
blowsy
woman
with
hair
as
they
both
tried
to
dive
under
the
table
at
the
same
place
the
bonney
brothers
simply
stood
and
stared
at
me
for
an
instant
unbelievingly
as
i
got
my
thumbs
on
the
of
my
belt
judge
nelson
gavel
was
hammering
and
he
was
shouting
the
floor
damn
he
means
it
switchblade
joe
bonney
exclaimed
then
they
all
reached
for
their
guns
they
were
still
reaching
when
i
pressed
the
studs
and
the
popped
up
into
my
hands
and
i
swung
up
my
gun
and
shot
through
the
head
after
that
i
just
let
my
subconscious
take
over
i
saw
gun
flames
jump
out
at
me
from
the
bonneys
weapons
and
i
felt
my
own
pistols
leap
and
writhe
in
my
hands
but
i
do
believe
i
was
aware
of
hearing
the
shots
not
even
from
my
own
weapons
the
whole
thing
probably
lasted
five
seconds
but
it
seemed
like
twenty
minutes
to
me
then
there
was
nobody
shooting
at
me
and
nobody
for
me
to
shoot
at
the
big
room
was
silent
and
i
was
aware
that
judge
nelson
and
his
eight
associates
were
rising
cautiously
from
behind
the
bench
i
holstered
my
gun
removed
and
replaced
the
magazine
of
the
gun
then
holstered
it
and
reloaded
the
other
one
hoddy
ringo
and
francisco
parros
and
commander
stonehenge
were
on
their
feet
their
pistols
drawn
covering
the
spectators
seats
colonel
hickock
had
also
drawn
a
pistol
and
he
was
covering
sidney
with
it
occasionally
moving
the
muzzle
to
the
left
to
include
the
ambassador
and
his
two
attachés
by
this
time
nelson
and
the
other
eight
judges
were
in
their
seats
trying
to
look
calm
and
judicial
your
honor
i
said
i
fully
realize
that
no
judge
likes
to
have
his
court
turned
into
a
shooting
gallery
i
can
assure
you
however
that
my
action
here
was
not
the
result
of
any
lack
of
respect
for
this
court
it
was
pure
necessity
your
honor
can
see
that
my
government
could
not
permit
this
crime
against
its
ambassador
to
pass
unpunished
judge
nelson
nodded
solemnly
court
was
adjourned
when
this
little
incident
happened
mr
silk
he
said
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
to
where
the
three
bonney
brothers
were
making
a
mess
of
blood
on
the
floor
i
trust
that
nobody
will
construe
my
unofficial
and
personal
comments
here
as
establishing
any
legal
precedent
and
i
would
like
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
become
customary
but
you
did
that
all
by
yourself
with
those
little
beanshooters
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
mr
silk
i
thanked
him
then
turned
to
the
ambassador
i
did
bother
putting
my
remarks
into
basic
he
understood
as
well
as
i
did
what
i
was
saying
look
fido
i
told
him
my
government
is
quite
well
aware
of
the
source
from
which
the
orders
for
the
murder
of
my
predecessor
came
these
men
i
just
killed
were
only
the
tools
we
going
to
get
the
brains
behind
them
if
we
have
to
send
every
warship
we
own
into
the
and
devastate
every
planet
in
it
we
do
let
dogs
snap
at
us
and
when
they
do
we
do
kick
them
we
shoot
them
that
of
course
was
not
exactly
diplomatic
language
i
wondered
for
a
moment
what
norman
gazarian
the
protocol
man
would
think
if
he
heard
an
ambassador
calling
another
ambassador
fido
but
it
seemed
to
be
the
kind
of
language
that
vuvuvu
understood
he
skinned
back
his
upper
lip
at
me
and
began
snarling
and
growling
then
he
turned
on
his
hind
paws
and
padded
angrily
down
the
aisle
away
from
the
front
of
the
courtroom
the
spectators
around
him
and
above
him
began
barking
baying
yelping
at
him
tie
a
can
to
his
tail
git
for
home
bruno
then
somebody
yelled
hey
look
even
his
wrist
watch
is
blushing
that
was
perfectly
true
gglafrr
ddespttann
vuvuvu
normally
white
was
now
glowing
a
bright
i
looked
at
stonehenge
and
found
him
looking
at
me
it
would
be
full
dark
in
four
or
five
hours
there
ought
to
be
something
spectacular
to
see
in
the
cloudless
skies
of
capella
iv
tonight
fleet
admiral
sir
rodney
tregaskis
would
see
to
that
report
of
stonehenge
to
secretary
of
aggression
klüng
so
the
measures
considered
by
yourself
and
secretary
of
state
ghopal
singh
and
security
coördinator
natalenko
as
transmitted
to
me
by
hoddy
ringo
were
not
i
am
glad
to
say
needed
ambassador
silk
alive
handled
the
thing
much
better
than
ambassador
silk
dead
could
possibly
have
to
confirm
sir
rodney
tregaskis
report
from
the
tales
of
the
few
survivors
the
attack
came
as
the
ambassador
had
expected
they
dropped
out
of
hyperspace
about
seventy
outside
the
capella
system
apparently
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
presence
of
our
fleet
have
learned
the
entire
fleet
consisted
of
about
three
hundred
spaceships
and
reports
reaching
here
indicate
that
no
more
than
twenty
got
back
to
cluster
naturally
the
whole
affair
has
had
a
profound
influence
an
influence
to
the
benefit
of
the
solar
league
on
all
shades
of
public
opinion
as
you
properly
assumed
hoddy
ringo
is
no
longer
with
us
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
annexation
treaty
would
be
ratified
here
ringo
immediately
saw
that
his
status
of
diplomatic
immunity
would
automatically
terminate
accordingly
he
left
this
system
embarking
from
new
austin
for
alderbaran
ix
mentioning
as
he
shook
hands
with
me
something
about
a
widow
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
richest
branch
bank
in
the
city
was
held
up
by
a
lone
bandit
about
half
an
hour
before
he
boarded
the
message
of
the
last
solar
ambassador
to
new
texas
stephen
silk
copies
of
the
treaty
of
annexation
duly
ratified
by
the
new
texas
legislature
herewith
please
note
that
the
guarantees
of
in
local
political
institutions
are
the
very
minimum
which
are
acceptable
to
the
people
of
new
texas
they
are
especially
adamant
that
there
will
be
no
change
in
their
peculiar
methods
of
insuring
that
their
elected
and
appointed
public
officials
shall
be
responsible
to
the
electorate
department
addendum
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
mr
silk
remained
on
new
texas
married
the
daughter
of
a
local
rancher
there
see
file
on
first
ambassador
colonel
andrew
jackson
hickock
and
is
still
active
in
politics
on
that
planet
often
in
opposition
to
solar
league
policies
which
he
seems
to
anticipate
with
an
almost
uncanny
natalenko
the
addendum
pursed
his
thick
lips
and
sighed
there
were
so
many
ways
he
could
be
using
stephen
silk
for
example
he
looked
at
the
both
usefully
and
beautifully
decorating
his
walls
over
there
where
