chapter
i
a
mysterious
tapping
lucile
tucker
stirred
in
her
berth
opened
her
eyes
drowsily
then
a
thought
into
a
whispered
what
was
that
the
next
instant
she
sat
bolt
upright
she
had
heard
it
again
this
time
not
in
a
dream
it
was
a
faint
with
a
hollow
sound
to
it
as
if
beaten
on
the
head
of
a
barrel
she
strained
her
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
but
now
caught
only
the
constant
of
the
as
it
beat
the
mast
of
the
yacht
the
o
moo
a
sure
sign
of
a
rising
storm
she
strained
her
eyes
to
peer
into
the
darkness
to
the
right
of
her
she
wanted
to
see
her
two
companions
who
should
be
sleeping
there
to
make
sure
they
were
still
with
her
she
could
not
see
the
shutters
were
tightly
closed
and
there
was
no
moon
the
place
was
dark
black
as
soot
she
stilled
her
breathing
to
listen
again
but
caught
only
the
of
that
accompanied
now
and
then
by
the
drumlike
boom
of
canvas
the
storm
was
rising
soon
it
would
be
lashing
the
waves
into
white
foam
to
send
them
crashing
high
above
the
breakwaters
she
shivered
a
storm
aboard
ship
had
always
frightened
her
yet
now
as
she
thought
of
the
term
aboard
ship
she
shrugged
her
slim
shoulders
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
as
she
murmured
the
cruise
of
the
o
moo
suddenly
her
thoughts
were
broken
in
upon
by
the
repetition
of
that
mysterious
sound
of
a
like
a
drumming
on
a
hollow
tree
was
her
unspoken
comment
only
birds
do
work
at
night
it
like
like
someone
driving
yes
driving
tacks
only
who
could
it
be
and
anyway
why
would
they
drive
tacks
into
our
yacht
at
midnight
the
thought
was
so
absurd
that
she
dismissed
it
at
once
dismissing
the
whole
problem
for
the
moment
she
began
thinking
through
the
events
which
had
led
up
to
that
moment
she
with
marian
norton
her
cousin
as
you
will
remember
if
you
chance
to
have
read
the
account
of
their
previous
adventure
as
recorded
in
the
book
called
the
blue
envelope
had
spent
the
previous
year
on
the
shores
of
behring
straits
in
alaska
and
siberia
there
they
had
been
carried
through
a
rather
amazing
series
of
thrilling
adventures
which
had
not
been
without
their
financial
advantages
especially
to
marian
lucile
father
had
been
when
she
had
left
her
home
at
anacortes
washington
a
salmon
fisherman
she
had
felt
no
fear
of
lack
of
money
for
further
schooling
the
two
girls
had
therefore
planned
to
study
during
this
present
year
lucile
at
a
great
university
situated
near
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
and
marion
in
a
renowned
school
of
art
in
the
same
city
but
fortune
plays
rude
tricks
at
times
they
had
returned
to
find
that
lucile
father
fortune
had
been
dissipated
by
an
unfortunate
investment
in
for
catching
a
run
of
salmon
a
salmon
run
which
failed
and
that
marian
father
had
a
gold
mine
which
had
panned
out
not
enough
gold
to
pay
for
the
miner
mucklucks
so
marian
had
given
up
the
major
portion
of
the
money
paid
to
her
by
the
ethnological
society
for
her
sketches
and
lucile
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
receiving
money
from
her
father
for
a
university
education
they
had
not
however
given
up
their
plans
for
further
schooling
have
to
live
carefully
and
not
spend
an
extra
cent
had
been
way
of
summing
up
the
situation
and
we
can
make
it
all
right
why
just
look
at
the
price
for
rooms
at
the
university
she
referred
to
a
catalogue
in
her
hand
dollars
a
term
that
is
less
than
two
dollars
a
week
we
could
pay
that
rooms
outside
the
university
certainly
ca
be
any
more
probably
not
as
much
lucile
smiled
now
as
she
recalled
this
bit
of
crude
reasoning
they
had
hurried
on
to
the
university
with
their
little
checking
accounts
they
had
had
but
here
again
lucile
started
and
sprang
half
out
of
her
berth
came
again
that
mysterious
what
can
it
be
she
whispered
marian
florence
wake
up
someone
is
these
last
words
uttered
in
a
whisper
died
on
her
lips
the
other
girls
slept
on
what
was
the
use
of
waking
them
could
be
anything
serious
and
if
it
were
what
could
they
do
at
this
mad
hour
of
night
suppose
they
routed
out
old
timmie
keeper
of
the
dry
dock
what
could
he
do
it
was
black
as
jet
out
there
so
she
reasoned
and
having
settled
back
between
her
blankets
began
again
the
recalling
of
events
they
had
arrived
in
the
city
by
the
lake
to
be
completely
disillusioned
all
university
rooms
had
been
reserved
for
months
ahead
so
too
had
all
outside
rooms
which
might
be
had
for
a
reasonable
price
to
pay
the
price
demanded
for
such
rooms
as
were
available
had
been
impossible
they
faced
the
danger
of
being
obliged
to
return
to
their
homes
and
this
to
such
girls
as
they
were
was
a
calamity
unthinkable
just
at
this
critical
moment
the
o
moo
had
shown
her
masts
above
the
horizon
she
was
a
trim
little
pleasure
yacht
thoroughly
equipped
for
living
on
board
she
belonged
to
a
wealthy
doctor
named
holmes
a
friend
of
lucile
father
she
in
dry
dock
down
about
two
miles
from
the
university
he
had
told
the
girls
you
welcome
to
live
in
her
for
the
winter
canvas
over
her
now
but
you
can
prop
that
up
here
and
there
i
guess
make
a
snug
place
to
camp
i
say
cabin
about
ten
by
thirty
and
there
everything
you
need
from
an
eggbeater
to
an
electric
range
there
electric
lights
and
everything
motor
supplies
go
on
live
there
if
you
want
to
keep
house
and
everything
pretty
stiff
walk
to
the
u
but
there
the
lagoon
in
winter
with
good
skating
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
way
what
say
want
to
try
it
old
timmie
the
keeper
of
the
dry
dock
will
see
that
nobody
bothers
you
there
some
chinamen
living
in
a
barge
out
there
some
fishermen
in
a
smack
and
a
young
chap
in
a
gasoline
schooner
guess
they
are
all
peaceable
folks
though
might
get
another
girl
or
two
to
go
in
with
you
plenty
of
room
we
live
on
board
her
two
months
every
summer
two
families
of
us
six
in
all
if
the
girls
had
been
captivated
at
once
by
this
novel
plan
once
they
had
climbed
aboard
the
yacht
they
had
been
thrilled
and
delighted
at
the
sight
which
met
their
eyes
she
she
a
regular
little
floating
palace
lucile
had
stammered
tut
tut
holmes
had
remonstrated
not
quite
a
palace
though
comfortable
enough
and
not
floating
at
all
at
the
present
moment
it
will
be
a
cruise
the
winter
cruise
of
the
o
moo
lucile
had
exclaimed
in
delight
had
she
but
known
how
real
these
words
would
be
to
her
some
time
hence
the
winter
cruise
of
the
o
moo
she
might
have
shuddered
with
fear
and
been
sorely
tempted
not
to
accept
her
new
home
the
power
of
divination
was
not
one
of
her
talents
so
with
marian
at
her
side
she
had
proceeded
to
lift
the
heavy
canvas
which
enshrouded
the
yacht
deck
and
having
crept
a
truly
wonderful
cabin
it
was
all
done
in
dark
oak
with
broad
panels
of
green
canvas
along
the
walls
equipped
with
heavy
oak
tables
and
heavily
chairs
and
lounges
it
presented
the
appearance
of
a
splendidly
furnished
but
rather
eccentric
living
room
here
at
one
end
the
touch
of
a
lever
sent
an
electric
range
springing
up
from
the
floor
a
second
lever
lowered
a
partition
between
this
suddenly
improvised
kitchenette
and
the
living
room
two
cupboards
to
the
right
of
this
kitchen
displayed
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
the
opposite
wall
furnished
a
table
which
folded
up
when
not
in
use
behind
this
was
a
fully
equipped
kitchen
cabinet
convenient
when
in
use
out
of
the
way
when
not
needed
had
been
the
doctor
only
comment
this
kitchen
was
forward
aft
were
to
be
found
four
double
berths
modeled
after
the
upper
berths
of
a
pullman
sleeper
these
gave
the
maximum
of
comfort
and
when
folded
up
occupied
no
space
at
all
it
wonderful
had
been
the
most
the
girls
could
say
and
oh
doctor
holmes
we
pay
you
rent
for
it
you
surely
must
allow
us
to
do
that
marian
had
exclaimed
nonsense
the
good
doctor
had
exclaimed
worked
my
way
through
school
myself
know
what
it
means
all
i
ask
is
that
you
pass
the
good
work
on
to
some
other
fellow
who
needs
a
boost
when
you
are
through
with
school
and
making
money
so
here
they
were
and
had
been
for
two
months
all
comfortably
established
in
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
holmes
had
suggested
that
they
might
be
able
to
accommodate
another
girl
they
had
become
acquainted
with
florence
huyler
a
freshman
in
the
physical
culture
department
and
had
decided
at
once
that
she
was
just
the
girl
to
join
them
florence
had
not
waited
for
a
second
invitation
and
here
she
was
sleeping
in
the
berth
to
lucile
right
just
why
she
should
have
seemed
most
fitting
as
a
companion
for
such
an
adventure
i
can
best
tell
you
as
events
progress
the
long
hike
back
and
forth
to
the
university
and
the
art
school
had
been
a
bit
tiring
at
first
but
in
time
they
had
come
to
enjoy
it
then
winter
had
come
and
with
it
ice
on
the
lagoon
only
yesterday
they
had
had
their
first
wonderful
race
over
its
shining
surface
her
recollections
came
slower
and
slower
and
she
was
about
to
drift
off
into
a
dream
when
there
came
again
that
strange
once
more
she
sat
bolt
upright
to
peer
into
the
darkness
once
more
she
asked
herself
the
questions
what
can
it
be
should
i
waken
marian
and
florence
she
did
not
waken
them
to
do
so
would
seem
she
thought
a
trifle
silly
the
yacht
stood
upon
a
car
with
iron
wheels
which
rested
on
a
track
raised
five
feet
above
the
ground
by
a
stout
trestle
work
the
sides
of
the
yacht
towered
above
this
trestle
altogether
the
deck
of
the
yacht
was
fully
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
they
ascended
and
descended
by
means
of
a
rope
ladder
this
ladder
at
the
present
moment
lay
on
the
deck
no
one
could
enter
their
cabin
unless
he
were
possessed
of
a
ladder
and
any
person
attempting
this
would
at
once
be
detected
and
might
be
arrested
for
it
so
why
be
afraid
but
after
all
that
sound
was
puzzling
she
wanted
to
know
what
it
meant
for
some
time
she
contemplated
slipping
on
her
to
creep
out
on
deck
and
peer
over
the
side
but
the
wind
was
chill
and
still
rising
the
was
whipping
the
mast
with
fury
cold
out
there
she
thought
with
a
shiver
glad
the
o
moo
is
in
dry
dock
and
not
on
the
water
a
sudden
thought
brought
a
new
fear
of
a
whole
line
of
schooners
and
yachts
on
that
track
in
the
dry
dock
the
o
moo
was
the
one
closest
to
the
water
what
if
she
should
slip
back
into
the
water
and
be
driven
out
into
the
lake
lucile
shivered
again
then
she
smiled
how
absurd
did
not
a
heavy
cable
hold
her
in
place
were
not
the
wheels
of
the
car
on
which
she
rested
blocked
how
then
could
she
glide
back
into
the
lake
fortunately
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
this
very
might
be
the
knocking
of
a
hammer
which
was
driving
those
blocks
from
their
positions
before
the
wheels
of
the
car
since
this
thought
did
not
come
to
her
and
since
the
tapping
did
not
come
again
she
at
last
snuggled
down
among
the
blankets
and
fell
asleep
hardly
had
she
wakened
in
the
morning
before
she
recalled
this
strange
incident
of
the
night
hurriedly
slipping
into
a
middy
suit
and
slippers
she
raced
up
the
short
gangway
and
across
deck
tossing
the
rope
ladder
over
the
side
the
next
moment
she
might
have
been
seen
walking
slowly
about
the
hull
of
the
yacht
she
was
searching
for
traces
of
the
strange
tapping
having
passed
along
the
south
side
she
climbed
through
the
trestle
and
made
her
way
along
the
north
side
she
was
about
to
conclude
that
the
night
experience
had
been
purely
an
imaginary
one
when
a
white
spot
near
the
prow
attracted
her
attention
she
caught
her
breath
as
her
hand
reached
for
it
it
was
a
square
bit
of
paper
held
in
place
by
four
tacks
which
had
apparently
been
driven
into
the
hull
with
great
deliberation
that
explains
the
tapping
she
whispered
to
herself
sure
had
their
courage
right
along
with
them
thought
we
be
afraid
to
interfere
being
just
girls
i
suppose
wonder
what
it
is
she
reached
up
and
pulled
the
paper
free
from
the
tacks
as
soon
as
she
had
it
in
her
hand
she
realized
that
written
on
it
was
a
message
she
read
it
read
it
twice
then
stood
there
staring
the
paper
was
of
a
peculiar
variety
the
words
were
written
in
a
strangely
artistic
fashion
fine
as
the
tracing
of
a
woman
pen
each
letter
stood
out
distinct
done
in
curves
of
wonderful
perfection
the
work
of
a
master
penman
but
she
did
not
pause
to
admire
the
handwriting
it
was
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
startled
her
as
she
read
you
must
not
stay
here
you
shall
not
stay
i
have
said
it
it
was
signed
only
with
a
crosslike
figure
a
bizarre
sketch
that
might
well
have
represented
the
claw
of
a
bird
or
a
dragon
lucile
added
with
a
little
intake
of
breath
i
must
show
the
girls
she
exclaimed
and
nimble
as
a
squirrel
was
away
over
the
trestle
and
up
the
rope
ladder
when
the
other
girls
had
heard
lucile
story
and
had
read
the
note
they
were
more
astonished
than
alarmed
huh
exclaimed
florence
gripping
an
iron
rod
above
her
and
lifting
her
full
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
easily
with
one
hand
who
telling
us
whether
we
can
stay
here
or
not
i
say
they
better
not
let
you
get
near
them
smiled
lucile
florence
laughed
and
releasing
her
grip
on
the
rod
sat
down
to
think
does
seem
possible
it
could
be
anyone
living
in
the
other
boats
she
mused
i
seen
that
young
man
they
call
mark
pence
the
fellow
who
lives
in
the
gasoline
schooner
just
once
he
seems
to
be
decent
enough
and
the
old
fishermen
put
in
marian
i
hired
two
of
them
to
pose
for
some
sketches
last
week
nice
old
fellows
they
are
a
little
rough
but
entirely
harmless
besides
what
difference
could
it
make
to
them
whether
we
live
here
or
not
there
the
chinamen
who
run
a
little
laundry
in
that
old
scow
said
lucile
thoughtfully
but
they
are
the
of
them
all
with
their
black
pajama
suits
and
pigtails
and
that
all
of
them
except
old
timmie
and
his
wife
said
florence
rising
and
pressing
the
lever
which
brought
the
electric
range
into
position
and
as
for
timmie
i
as
soon
suspect
my
own
father
we
tell
him
about
it
said
lucile
he
might
help
us
they
did
tell
timmie
but
he
could
throw
no
light
on
the
subject
he
appeared
puzzled
and
a
little
disturbed
but
his
final
counsel
was
someone
playing
a
practical
joke
on
you
pay
no
attention
to
it
pay
no
attention
at
all
the
girls
accepted
his
advice
indeed
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
about
it
all
the
same
was
lucile
concluding
word
i
do
like
it
looks
as
if
someone
in
this
vicinity
were
doing
something
they
should
not
do
and
were
afraid
we
catch
them
at
it
i
for
one
shall
keep
an
eye
out
for
trouble
the
other
two
girls
agreed
with
her
and
while
they
did
not
alter
their
daily
program
in
the
least
they
did
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
suspicious
characters
who
might
be
lurking
about
the
dry
dock
chapter
ii
the
blue
face
in
the
night
lucile
need
not
have
kept
an
eye
out
for
trouble
trouble
was
destined
to
find
her
and
needed
no
watching
as
she
expressed
it
afterward
it
does
seem
to
matter
much
where
you
are
nor
what
you
are
doing
if
you
are
destined
for
adventures
you
have
them
but
the
thing
which
happened
to
her
on
the
following
evening
though
doubly
mysterious
and
haunting
in
its
character
appeared
to
have
no
connection
whatever
to
the
incident
of
the
note
the
storm
which
had
been
rising
all
night
had
lulled
with
the
morning
sun
but
by
was
raging
again
with
redoubled
fury
sending
the
spray
dashing
high
above
the
breakwaters
it
now
and
then
cast
a
huge
cake
of
ice
clear
of
the
water
tallest
crest
and
brought
it
down
upon
the
breakwater
rim
with
the
sound
of
an
exploding
cannon
carrying
blinding
sheets
of
snow
before
it
the
wind
rose
steadily
in
force
and
volume
until
the
most
hardy
pedestrian
made
headway
against
it
with
the
greatest
difficulty
when
lucile
left
the
university
grounds
to
face
east
and
to
begin
forcing
her
way
against
the
wind
to
the
yacht
night
had
fallen
dark
as
it
should
be
at
seven
woo
what
a
gale
she
shivered
as
buttoning
her
mackinaw
tightly
about
her
throat
she
bent
forward
to
meet
the
storm
for
a
half
hour
her
body
beaten
and
torn
by
the
wind
her
face
cut
by
driving
sleet
she
fought
her
way
onward
into
the
night
she
had
reached
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
was
making
her
way
south
or
at
least
thought
she
was
so
dense
was
the
darkness
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
she
kept
her
directions
wish
wish
i
had
tried
getting
a
place
to
stay
nearer
the
university
she
half
sobbed
as
if
in
answer
to
these
words
the
storm
appeared
to
redouble
its
fury
seizing
her
with
its
whirling
grip
it
carried
her
in
a
semicircle
to
land
her
at
last
against
a
stone
wall
so
great
was
the
force
of
her
impact
that
for
the
moment
she
lay
there
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
only
partly
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
when
at
last
she
was
able
to
rise
she
knew
that
she
had
completely
lost
her
way
might
as
well
follow
the
wall
she
thought
desperately
little
more
sheltered
here
bring
me
to
some
place
after
a
time
the
fury
of
wind
and
snow
continued
at
times
she
fancied
she
felt
the
spray
from
waves
dampen
her
cheeks
she
heard
distinctly
the
break
of
these
waves
against
the
wall
she
told
herself
shuddering
as
the
thought
came
to
her
that
she
might
suddenly
reach
the
end
of
this
wall
and
be
blown
into
the
lake
anyway
i
ca
stay
here
she
muttered
too
cold
face
is
freezing
i
guess
she
paused
to
remove
a
glove
and
touch
her
cheek
the
next
instant
she
was
rubbing
it
vigorously
frozen
all
right
have
to
get
in
somewhere
soon
just
at
that
moment
her
heart
leaped
wildly
for
a
moment
the
drive
of
snow
had
slackened
in
that
moment
a
great
black
bulk
loomed
up
at
her
right
some
building
she
thrilled
and
at
once
doubled
her
efforts
to
escape
from
the
storm
and
reach
this
promised
shelter
as
still
hugging
the
wall
she
came
closer
to
the
looming
structure
she
saw
that
it
showed
not
a
single
gleaming
light
the
next
moment
her
lips
parted
in
an
exclamation
of
dismay
the
old
spanish
mission
no
one
there
has
been
for
years
once
she
had
forced
her
mind
to
sober
thought
she
realized
that
she
had
no
reason
to
hope
for
anything
better
there
were
but
four
structures
on
that
mile
of
on
the
lake
all
deserted
at
this
time
of
year
a
broad
low
pavilion
a
huge
flat
a
towering
castle
relic
of
a
great
fair
once
held
on
these
grounds
and
this
spanish
mission
which
never
had
been
a
real
mission
but
merely
a
reproduction
of
one
dating
back
into
other
centuries
a
huge
wooden
hull
of
a
thing
resembling
a
with
its
narrow
windows
and
low
doors
it
had
always
stirred
lucile
curiosity
now
she
was
about
to
seek
shelter
in
it
or
at
least
in
the
lee
of
it
it
was
deserted
empty
fast
falling
into
decay
a
mysterious
haunty
place
yet
so
buffeted
by
the
storm
was
she
so
frightened
by
the
onrush
of
the
elements
that
she
felt
quite
equal
to
creeping
through
some
opening
into
its
vast
emptiness
should
an
opening
appear
and
an
opening
did
offer
her
opportunity
to
test
her
nerve
it
was
a
window
the
glass
shattered
by
the
storm
her
heart
beating
wildly
she
squeezed
through
into
the
inky
blackness
on
tiptoe
she
made
her
way
down
the
wall
to
the
right
she
was
obliged
to
feel
for
every
step
there
was
not
a
ray
of
light
some
big
hall
she
decided
after
she
had
moved
along
for
a
space
of
forty
feet
or
more
she
whispered
the
chapel
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
imagine
being
in
a
deserted
chapel
on
such
a
night
suddenly
overcome
with
the
thought
that
she
might
stumble
into
an
altar
or
a
crucifix
she
halted
and
stood
there
trembling
she
had
always
felt
a
great
awe
for
such
things
she
stood
there
until
her
legs
ached
with
the
strain
of
holding
to
one
position
then
she
pushed
on
slowly
suddenly
she
brushed
against
something
recoiling
in
fright
she
stood
there
motionless
at
last
she
had
the
courage
to
bend
over
and
put
out
a
hand
to
her
intense
relief
she
found
that
she
had
come
upon
a
bench
standing
against
the
wall
having
tested
its
strength
she
sat
down
leaning
back
she
rested
that
better
she
breathed
the
storm
will
soon
be
over
then
get
out
of
here
and
go
to
the
yacht
the
drive
of
the
wind
the
chill
of
the
storm
had
made
her
drowsy
the
night
before
her
sleep
had
been
disturbed
as
she
sat
there
her
head
drooped
more
and
more
it
began
nodding
then
suddenly
came
up
with
a
jerk
again
she
was
awake
she
would
not
fall
asleep
she
told
herself
would
not
would
not
yet
in
three
minutes
she
was
nodding
again
this
time
her
chin
sank
lower
and
lower
until
at
last
it
rested
on
her
breast
which
moved
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
rhythmic
breathing
of
one
who
sleeps
how
long
she
slept
would
be
hard
to
tell
so
natural
was
her
awaking
that
she
did
not
realize
that
she
had
been
asleep
at
all
yet
she
sensed
that
something
about
the
place
was
different
a
vague
uneasiness
stole
over
her
once
she
had
opened
her
eyes
she
knew
what
it
was
there
was
light
a
strange
light
somewhere
in
the
room
a
dim
almost
imperceptible
illumination
pervaded
all
as
she
turned
her
head
without
moving
in
her
seat
she
with
difficulty
suppressed
a
scream
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
an
apparition
or
so
at
least
it
seemed
a
blue
face
a
face
of
blue
fire
it
ca
be
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
yet
it
is
her
mind
did
all
the
talking
her
lips
were
numb
it
is
doubtful
if
she
could
have
spoken
had
she
dared
to
but
this
was
no
time
to
speak
she
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
yet
there
was
a
face
an
illumined
face
an
ugly
face
more
fiendish
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
appearing
alive
it
rose
from
the
center
of
a
decaying
table
standing
before
an
altar
beside
the
altar
revealed
by
the
pale
bluish
light
which
the
face
appeared
to
shed
about
it
were
two
tarnished
candlesticks
and
back
of
it
against
the
wall
hung
a
crucifix
completely
paralyzed
by
the
sight
of
this
blue
face
in
the
night
and
by
its
awesome
surroundings
she
sat
there
quite
motionless
the
light
of
the
blue
face
appeared
to
wax
and
wane
to
come
and
go
like
the
faint
smiles
that
often
pass
over
a
child
face
lucile
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
notion
that
the
face
was
looking
at
her
at
the
same
time
there
came
the
question
is
there
light
enough
to
reveal
my
face
she
glanced
down
to
the
floor
then
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
she
could
not
see
her
own
feet
silently
drawing
her
scarf
over
her
face
covering
all
but
her
eyes
and
hiding
her
hands
beneath
her
coat
she
sat
there
hardly
daring
to
breathe
she
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
pale
blue
light
there
stole
three
figures
whether
these
were
men
or
women
monks
nuns
or
devils
she
could
not
tell
so
closely
were
they
enshrouded
in
robes
or
coats
of
black
cloth
they
knelt
before
the
blue
face
and
remained
there
motionless
to
quiet
her
nerves
lucile
began
to
count
she
had
reached
one
hundred
when
for
fear
she
would
lose
all
control
of
herself
and
scream
or
run
she
closed
her
eyes
she
had
counted
to
one
thousand
before
she
dared
open
them
again
when
she
did
so
she
found
another
surprise
awaiting
her
the
kneeling
figures
were
gone
gone
too
was
the
face
or
at
least
it
was
no
longer
illumined
the
place
was
dark
as
a
dungeon
strangely
enough
too
the
wail
of
the
storm
had
subsided
to
a
whisper
only
the
distant
boom
of
breakers
told
her
that
a
terrific
blizzard
had
passed
over
the
lake
rising
without
a
sound
she
tiptoed
her
way
along
the
wall
reaching
the
window
she
leaped
out
upon
the
ground
and
was
away
like
a
flash
with
knees
that
trembled
so
they
would
scarcely
support
her
she
ran
for
a
full
half
mile
before
she
dared
slow
down
and
look
back
the
snowstorm
was
over
the
moon
half
out
she
could
see
for
some
distance
behind
her
but
all
she
saw
was
a
glistening
stretch
of
snowy
landscape
then
she
made
her
way
thoughtfully
to
the
dry
dock
once
on
board
the
o
moo
she
told
the
other
girls
nothing
of
her
adventures
merely
said
she
had
been
delayed
by
the
storm
but
that
evening
as
she
attempted
to
study
she
would
now
and
then
give
a
sudden
start
once
she
sprang
up
so
violently
that
she
upset
her
chair
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
marian
demanded
nothing
just
nerves
she
said
forcing
a
smile
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
study
after
that
she
went
and
curled
up
in
a
huge
upholstered
rocker
even
here
she
did
not
fall
asleep
but
sat
staring
before
her
until
it
was
bedtime
they
had
all
been
in
their
berths
for
fifteen
minutes
florence
had
dozed
off
when
she
was
suddenly
wakened
by
a
hand
on
her
arm
it
was
lucile
please
please
she
whispered
i
ca
sleep
alone
florence
put
out
a
strong
hand
and
drew
her
up
into
the
berth
then
pulled
the
covers
down
over
them
both
and
clasped
her
gently
in
her
arms
lucile
did
not
move
for
some
time
she
had
apparently
fallen
asleep
when
she
suddenly
started
violently
and
whispered
hoarsely
no
no
it
ca
be
i
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
at
the
same
time
a
great
shudder
shot
through
her
frame
tell
me
about
it
whispered
florence
holding
her
tight
then
in
halting
whispered
sentences
lucile
told
of
the
adventure
that
strange
whispered
florence
reminds
me
of
something
an
aged
sailor
told
me
once
something
that
happened
on
the
asiatic
side
of
the
pacific
too
long
to
tell
now
tell
you
sometime
though
does
seem
as
if
there
could
be
any
connection
surely
could
be
but
you
never
can
tell
better
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
relieved
of
half
her
fear
by
the
telling
of
the
story
lucile
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
chapter
iii
lucile
quick
action
gas
you
must
not
imagine
and
you
might
well
be
forgiven
for
doing
so
if
you
have
read
the
preceding
chapters
that
the
experiences
of
the
three
girls
whose
lives
are
pictured
here
were
a
series
of
closely
crowded
thrilling
adventures
it
was
not
the
case
that
no
sooner
was
the
curtain
run
down
on
one
mysterious
happening
than
the
stage
was
set
for
another
few
lives
are
like
that
adventures
do
come
to
us
all
at
times
and
we
face
them
for
the
most
part
bravely
some
amuse
and
entertain
others
startle
and
appall
but
each
teaches
in
its
own
way
some
new
lesson
of
life
adventures
taken
from
the
lives
of
others
bring
to
us
the
greatest
ratio
of
entertainment
but
it
is
our
own
exciting
and
mysterious
adventures
that
we
speak
of
most
often
when
we
are
clustered
on
the
deck
of
some
vessel
or
gathered
about
a
camp
fire
while
not
many
pages
of
this
book
may
be
devoted
to
the
everyday
school
life
of
these
girls
they
had
it
just
the
same
florence
and
lucile
strolled
the
campus
as
other
girls
strolled
they
cut
classes
at
times
they
passed
difficult
examinations
with
some
credit
they
reveled
in
the
grandeur
of
the
architecture
of
the
buildings
of
the
university
they
thrilled
at
the
thought
that
they
were
a
part
of
the
great
throng
that
daily
swarmed
from
the
lecture
halls
and
were
somewhat
downcast
when
they
came
fully
to
realize
their
own
insignificance
when
cast
into
such
a
tossing
sea
of
humanity
marian
the
artist
also
had
her
everyday
rounds
to
make
she
caught
the
car
downtown
five
days
in
the
week
to
labor
industriously
with
charcoal
and
brush
she
saw
her
alaskan
sketches
which
had
been
praised
so
often
and
so
highly
picked
to
pieces
by
the
ruthless
criticism
of
a
competent
teacher
but
she
rallied
from
her
first
disappointment
to
resolve
for
better
work
in
the
future
she
began
to
plan
how
this
might
be
accomplished
florence
marian
and
lucile
were
plain
ordinary
normal
girls
yet
in
one
respect
they
were
different
from
others
at
least
lucile
and
marian
were
from
the
first
and
florence
being
the
strongest
most
physically
capable
of
them
all
soon
caught
their
spirit
they
had
about
them
a
certain
fearless
outlook
on
life
which
is
nearly
always
found
in
those
who
have
spent
many
months
in
the
far
north
an
attitude
which
seems
to
say
adventure
and
trouble
i
have
met
you
before
i
welcome
you
and
will
profit
by
and
conquer
you
two
or
three
rather
ordinary
incidents
in
their
life
on
board
the
o
moo
prove
that
the
life
they
lived
there
was
on
the
whole
a
very
simple
normal
life
yet
they
also
illustrate
the
indisputable
fact
that
the
simplest
matters
in
the
world
the
casting
of
a
tin
can
off
a
boat
for
instance
may
be
connected
with
some
interesting
and
thrilling
adventure
as
to
that
particular
tin
can
marian
bought
it
at
a
grocery
store
along
with
other
cans
filled
with
some
unknown
contents
and
sold
at
the
ridiculously
low
price
of
eight
cents
per
can
the
reason
that
the
price
was
so
low
and
the
contents
unknown
was
that
the
labels
had
during
the
process
of
handling
been
accidentally
torn
off
the
cans
had
been
sent
on
to
the
retailer
and
were
sold
in
lots
of
two
dozen
each
you
see
the
obliging
grocer
had
explained
there
may
be
only
corn
or
peas
in
them
very
well
they
are
even
then
worth
twelve
cents
a
can
at
the
very
least
but
then
again
there
may
be
blackberries
in
thick
syrup
worth
thirty
or
forty
cents
a
can
then
what
a
bargain
well
girls
marian
exclaimed
when
she
had
finished
telling
of
her
bargain
and
they
of
exclaiming
over
it
what
shall
we
have
for
dinner
loganberries
in
thick
syrup
or
sliced
pineapple
oh
pineapple
by
all
means
florence
exclaimed
good
enough
for
me
smiled
lucile
all
right
here
goes
marian
stabbed
one
of
the
unknown
quantities
with
the
then
applied
her
nose
to
the
opening
corn
she
exclaimed
in
disgust
oh
well
consoled
florence
we
can
eat
corn
once
lucile
does
care
for
it
but
she
can
have
something
else
here
a
bowl
pour
it
out
in
that
then
open
the
loganberries
they
do
again
the
fell
again
came
the
disgusted
exclamation
corn
lucile
giggled
and
florence
danced
a
hornpipe
of
joy
that
one
on
you
marian
old
dear
she
shouted
oh
well
just
give
us
plain
peaches
they
do
here
one
that
has
a
real
gurgly
sound
when
you
shake
it
said
lucile
holding
a
can
to
her
ear
and
shaking
hard
i
think
it
strawberries
when
marian
opened
that
can
and
had
peered
into
it
she
said
never
a
word
but
walking
to
the
cabin
door
pitched
it
contents
and
all
over
the
rail
and
down
to
the
crusted
snow
twenty
feet
below
there
it
bounced
about
for
a
time
spilled
its
contents
upon
the
ground
then
lay
quite
still
a
new
tin
can
glistening
in
the
moonlight
but
watch
that
can
it
is
connected
with
some
further
adventure
corn
corn
corn
chanted
marian
in
a
shrill
voice
breaking
with
laughter
and
what
a
bargain
but
look
what
i
drew
exclaimed
lucile
pointing
to
a
can
she
had
just
opened
pineapple
sliced
pineapple
the
others
cheered
in
unison
then
the
three
cans
of
corn
were
speedily
forgiven
but
the
empty
can
lay
blinking
in
the
moonlight
all
the
same
the
other
affair
which
occurred
a
few
days
later
might
have
turned
into
a
rather
serious
matter
had
it
not
been
for
lucile
alert
mind
lucile
had
what
she
styled
a
bug
for
creating
things
if
only
she
exclaimed
again
and
again
i
could
create
something
different
from
anything
that
has
been
created
before
i
know
i
should
be
supremely
happy
if
only
i
could
write
a
real
story
that
would
get
into
print
or
discover
some
new
chemical
combination
that
would
do
things
that
would
be
glorious
from
these
words
one
is
not
long
in
concluding
that
lucile
was
specializing
in
english
and
chemistry
the
yacht
afforded
her
exceptional
opportunities
to
pursue
her
study
of
chemistry
out
of
regular
school
hours
for
holmes
who
devoted
much
time
to
delving
into
the
mysteries
of
organic
chemistry
had
installed
in
a
triangular
space
at
the
back
of
the
cabin
a
perfectly
equipped
laboratory
here
during
the
days
of
the
summer
tour
he
spent
much
of
his
time
this
laboratory
he
turned
over
to
lucile
the
only
provision
being
that
she
replace
retorts
and
other
instruments
broken
during
the
course
of
her
experiments
here
on
many
a
stormy
afternoon
and
often
long
into
the
night
she
worked
over
a
blue
flame
concocting
all
manner
of
fluids
and
gases
not
required
by
the
courses
she
was
taking
if
only
i
could
create
she
whispered
to
herself
over
and
over
memory
work
i
hate
imitation
i
like
only
because
it
tells
me
what
has
been
done
and
helps
me
to
discover
what
has
not
been
done
but
to
create
oh
oh
she
would
at
such
times
grip
at
her
breast
as
if
her
heart
were
paining
her
at
the
very
excitement
of
the
thought
on
one
particular
afternoon
she
did
create
something
in
fact
she
created
a
great
deal
of
excitement
she
had
taken
down
a
formula
which
holmes
had
left
in
a
notebook
looks
interesting
she
whispered
to
herself
she
had
worked
herself
up
that
day
to
a
feverish
heat
to
a
point
where
she
would
dare
anything
as
she
read
a
closely
written
notation
beneath
the
formula
her
eyes
widened
it
is
interesting
she
exclaimed
tremendous
i
make
it
would
dare
try
it
on
anyone
though
better
have
a
gas
mask
she
told
herself
after
a
moment
thought
digging
about
in
a
deep
drawer
she
at
last
took
out
a
strange
canvas
bag
with
a
attachment
this
she
hung
upon
a
peg
while
she
selected
the
particular
vials
needed
after
that
she
drew
the
gas
mask
over
her
head
and
plunged
into
the
work
ten
grains
she
murmured
a
fluid
ounce
three
drams
three
fluid
ounces
heat
this
in
a
beaker
add
two
drams
so
she
went
on
mumbling
to
herself
in
her
excitement
like
some
witch
in
a
play
too
bad
too
bad
wo
hold
it
she
mumbled
at
last
after
waiting
for
her
concoction
to
cool
wo
go
in
one
vial
have
to
use
two
having
filled
one
thin
glass
vial
and
closed
it
with
a
she
was
in
the
act
of
filling
the
second
when
the
vial
slipped
from
her
hand
and
went
crashing
to
the
tile
floor
oh
help
she
uttered
a
muffled
scream
and
before
she
realized
what
she
was
doing
threw
the
door
leading
into
the
main
cabin
wide
open
before
her
regarding
her
in
great
astonishment
were
marian
and
florence
for
a
few
seconds
they
stood
there
then
of
a
sudden
they
began
to
act
in
the
most
startling
manner
jumping
up
and
down
waving
their
arms
laughing
screaming
they
vaulted
over
tables
knocked
chairs
and
sent
books
and
papers
flying
in
every
direction
having
recovered
her
power
of
locomotion
lucile
dashed
for
the
outer
door
this
she
flung
wide
open
then
watching
her
chance
she
propelled
her
two
delirious
dancing
companions
out
into
the
open
air
there
for
a
moment
she
was
obliged
to
cling
to
them
lest
they
throw
themselves
over
the
rail
to
go
crashing
to
the
frozen
earth
below
in
another
moment
it
was
all
over
the
two
wild
dancers
collapsed
crumpling
up
in
heaps
on
the
deck
oh
girls
i
so
sorry
i
really
truly
am
lucile
mortification
was
quite
complete
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
fairly
bursting
with
a
desire
to
laugh
what
what
made
us
do
that
florence
stammered
weakly
gas
a
new
gas
answered
lucile
then
seeing
the
look
of
consternation
on
the
girls
faces
she
hastened
to
add
it
perfectly
harmless
does
attack
the
tissues
works
on
the
motor
nerves
like
only
it
gets
all
the
muscles
excited
not
just
those
of
the
face
well
i
say
remarked
marian
you
really
created
something
i
only
wish
i
had
said
lucile
regretfully
but
that
chances
to
be
a
formula
worked
out
by
holmes
i
merely
mixed
it
up
the
bottle
slipped
from
my
hand
and
smashed
on
the
floor
i
did
aim
to
try
it
out
on
you
after
the
cabin
had
been
thoroughly
aired
the
three
girls
went
back
to
their
work
as
lucile
put
the
laboratory
in
order
she
noted
the
vial
containing
the
remainder
of
the
strange
fluid
having
labeled
it
quick
action
gas
she
put
it
away
on
the
shelf
little
dreaming
that
she
would
find
an
unusual
use
for
it
later
it
was
two
weeks
after
lucile
mysterious
experience
in
the
old
mission
building
things
had
settled
down
to
the
humdrum
life
of
hard
work
and
faithful
study
on
saturday
night
two
girls
from
the
university
dormitories
skated
down
the
lagoon
and
walked
down
the
beach
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
ship
as
they
called
it
they
were
jolly
western
girls
the
five
of
them
spent
a
pleasant
evening
popping
corn
pulling
candy
and
relating
amusing
incidents
from
their
own
lives
at
eleven
the
visitors
declared
that
they
must
go
home
wait
i
go
a
piece
with
you
suggested
florence
reaching
for
her
skates
at
the
end
of
the
lagoon
the
three
put
on
their
skates
florence
were
on
first
for
she
wore
a
boyish
style
which
went
on
with
a
clamp
gliding
out
on
the
ice
she
struck
out
in
a
wide
circle
then
returned
to
the
others
just
as
they
came
gliding
out
to
meet
her
she
fancied
she
caught
a
movement
in
the
branches
of
some
shrubs
at
the
left
which
grew
down
to
the
edge
of
the
ice
for
a
second
her
eyes
rested
there
then
she
was
obliged
to
turn
about
to
join
her
companions
it
was
a
glorious
night
the
skating
was
wonderful
keen
air
caressed
their
cheeks
as
they
shot
over
the
glistening
surface
to
the
tune
of
ringing
steel
little
wonder
she
forgot
the
moving
bushes
in
the
joy
of
the
moment
florence
was
a
born
athlete
tipping
the
scale
at
one
hundred
and
sixty
she
carried
not
a
superfluous
ounce
of
fat
four
hours
every
day
she
spent
on
the
gym
floor
or
in
the
swimming
pool
she
was
equipping
herself
for
the
work
of
a
physical
culture
teacher
and
took
her
task
seriously
she
believed
that
most
girls
could
be
as
strong
as
boys
if
they
willed
to
be
and
she
proceeded
to
set
a
shining
example
it
was
on
her
return
trip
that
she
was
reminded
of
the
moving
bushes
catching
the
distant
ring
of
skates
she
saw
a
person
dressed
in
a
long
coat
of
some
sort
coming
rapidly
toward
her
the
channel
where
they
would
meet
was
narrow
some
instinct
told
her
to
turn
back
to
circle
the
island
and
to
reach
the
nearest
point
to
the
yacht
that
way
whirling
about
she
set
herself
going
rapidly
in
the
other
direction
now
that
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
she
told
herself
probably
someone
saving
a
long
walk
by
putting
on
his
skates
same
as
i
doing
might
embarrass
him
to
have
me
turn
about
that
way
she
was
getting
in
some
long
strong
strokes
now
there
were
few
who
could
gain
on
her
when
she
chose
to
exert
herself
she
rounded
the
point
of
the
island
with
a
swift
curve
then
went
skimming
down
the
other
side
without
further
thought
of
the
lone
skater
she
was
nearing
her
goal
and
had
gone
into
a
long
slide
when
of
a
sudden
the
of
skates
again
came
to
her
ears
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
her
to
turn
about
to
make
sure
that
the
stranger
in
the
long
coat
had
also
rounded
the
island
for
a
second
she
glided
on
uncertain
what
course
to
take
it
was
nearing
midnight
she
was
alone
on
the
lagoon
a
long
way
from
any
habitation
a
stranger
was
following
her
why
she
could
not
tell
to
throw
off
her
skates
and
gain
the
bank
before
he
came
up
was
impossible
she
decided
without
being
greatly
alarmed
about
it
again
to
circle
the
island
and
if
necessary
take
a
spin
the
whole
length
of
the
lagoon
chapter
iv
trapped
in
the
old
museum
florence
had
little
fear
for
the
outcome
of
this
rather
amusing
adventure
she
had
been
trailed
over
the
ice
by
possible
admirers
before
she
did
not
care
to
allow
this
one
to
catch
up
with
her
that
was
all
she
would
skim
along
down
to
the
far
end
of
the
lagoon
where
a
mile
and
a
half
away
the
dome
of
the
old
museum
loomed
a
black
bulk
in
the
dark
she
would
then
make
the
broad
turn
which
this
end
of
the
lagoon
afforded
she
would
have
a
clear
mile
and
a
half
in
which
to
put
forth
her
best
efforts
surely
she
could
outdistance
the
stranger
and
with
skates
off
be
away
over
the
slope
and
down
the
beach
toward
the
o
moo
before
he
had
reached
this
end
of
the
lagoon
once
more
saving
her
strength
on
the
down
trip
keeping
an
even
distance
from
the
mysterious
skater
she
glided
onward
toward
the
old
museum
just
as
she
neared
the
broad
end
where
she
was
to
make
the
turn
she
glanced
back
at
that
very
moment
the
flash
of
a
powerful
automobile
lamp
on
the
park
drive
a
half
mile
away
fell
full
upon
the
face
a
little
cry
escaped
her
lips
this
was
no
mere
youthful
enthusiast
his
was
the
face
of
one
whom
few
would
trust
at
that
very
moment
his
visage
was
twisted
into
an
ugly
snarl
which
said
plainer
than
words
now
young
lady
i
have
you
why
she
whispered
to
herself
that
might
be
the
face
of
a
murderer
at
that
same
instant
there
flashed
through
her
mind
the
note
of
warning
tacked
on
the
schooner
perhaps
this
was
the
man
who
had
placed
it
there
in
her
consternation
she
missed
a
stroke
one
skate
struck
a
crack
in
the
ice
the
clamp
slipped
the
skate
went
flying
disaster
impended
florence
was
not
a
person
to
be
easily
defeated
one
instant
she
had
kicked
the
remaining
skate
from
her
foot
and
the
next
she
was
racing
away
over
the
glistening
ice
she
stumbled
and
all
but
fell
but
gaining
courage
from
the
sloping
bank
she
plunged
on
now
she
was
ten
yards
away
now
five
the
metal
of
skates
behind
her
grew
louder
redoubling
her
efforts
she
at
last
flung
herself
upon
the
snowy
slope
to
climb
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
crest
then
to
race
across
a
level
space
and
gain
the
sheltering
shadows
of
the
museum
it
had
been
a
hard
struggle
for
a
few
seconds
she
leaned
panting
against
the
wall
one
skate
was
still
in
her
hand
without
thinking
why
she
tucked
this
skate
into
the
belt
of
her
coat
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
what
should
she
do
she
was
not
safe
here
for
the
man
to
remove
his
skates
and
scale
the
bank
required
but
a
moment
they
were
alone
in
the
frozen
park
a
mile
from
any
protection
she
could
be
sure
of
she
was
not
a
good
runner
no
she
whispered
i
could
do
it
she
chanced
to
glance
up
and
her
lips
parted
in
a
suppressed
exclamation
there
was
a
window
open
above
her
true
it
was
some
fifteen
feet
up
but
there
was
an
iron
grating
on
the
window
beneath
it
if
only
the
grating
is
not
rusted
out
she
murmured
hopefully
and
the
next
instant
she
had
reached
the
ledge
of
brickwork
and
was
shaking
the
railing
vigorously
it
hold
i
guess
up
she
went
like
a
monkey
climbing
the
side
of
a
cage
at
the
top
of
this
grating
there
came
an
agonizing
second
in
which
she
felt
herself
in
danger
of
toppling
over
before
she
gained
her
balance
on
the
window
ledge
above
her
splendid
training
served
her
well
she
threw
herself
across
the
stone
casing
and
for
a
few
seconds
lay
there
listening
hardly
had
she
dropped
noiselessly
to
the
floor
some
three
feet
below
than
she
heard
the
of
hurrying
footsteps
on
the
snow
holding
her
breath
she
crouched
there
motionless
hoping
beyond
hope
that
she
might
hear
those
footsteps
pass
on
around
the
building
in
this
hope
she
was
disappointed
like
a
hound
who
has
lost
his
scent
the
man
doubled
back
then
paused
beneath
her
window
the
girl
heart
raced
on
was
she
trapped
the
man
she
felt
sure
would
somehow
gain
access
to
the
building
nevertheless
she
might
escape
him
the
building
had
once
been
a
museum
the
central
building
of
a
great
world
exposition
no
longer
used
as
a
museum
it
stood
there
an
immense
unused
structure
slowly
dropping
into
decay
the
floor
on
which
she
had
landed
was
really
a
broad
balcony
with
a
rusty
railing
at
its
edge
from
where
she
crouched
she
could
see
down
into
the
main
floor
where
stretched
twining
and
mile
upon
mile
of
rooms
and
corridors
slipping
out
of
her
shoes
she
buttoned
them
to
her
belt
then
stole
noiselessly
along
the
balcony
moving
ever
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
she
came
to
a
rusty
iron
stair
here
she
paused
would
the
stair
creak
give
her
away
the
man
might
at
this
moment
be
in
the
building
on
the
ground
floor
yet
on
this
narrow
balcony
she
was
sure
sooner
or
later
to
be
trapped
she
must
risk
it
placing
one
trembling
foot
on
the
top
step
she
allowed
her
weight
to
settle
upon
it
there
followed
no
sound
breathing
more
easily
she
began
the
descent
only
once
did
her
heart
stand
still
a
bit
of
loose
plaster
touched
by
her
foot
bounded
downward
she
dared
not
pause
the
die
was
cast
once
on
the
ground
floor
she
sprang
across
a
patch
of
light
and
found
herself
in
the
shadows
once
more
moving
with
the
greatest
possible
speed
yet
with
even
greater
caution
avoiding
bits
of
plaster
rustling
papers
and
other
impediments
in
her
course
she
made
her
way
along
a
wall
which
to
her
heightened
imagination
seemed
to
stretch
on
for
a
mile
once
as
she
paused
she
thought
she
caught
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
followed
by
a
dull
thud
must
have
come
in
through
my
window
she
decided
and
indeed
there
appeared
to
be
no
other
means
of
access
all
the
ground
floor
doors
and
windows
were
either
heavily
shuttered
or
grated
these
shutters
and
gratings
she
told
herself
trying
to
still
the
fear
in
her
heart
by
thinking
of
other
things
are
relics
of
other
days
here
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
relics
curios
and
costly
jewels
were
once
displayed
mounted
animals
and
birds
aisle
after
aisle
of
them
rooms
full
of
rich
furs
and
costly
silks
jewels
too
in
abundance
they
all
gone
now
but
the
shutters
are
still
here
and
i
am
trapped
there
only
one
exit
and
that
guarded
well
perhaps
another
somewhere
anyway
i
can
wait
daylight
drives
wolves
to
their
dens
if
only
i
can
reach
the
other
balcony
she
had
been
in
the
building
in
the
days
of
its
glory
and
had
visited
one
of
the
curators
a
friend
of
her
mother
there
were
on
this
other
balcony
she
remembered
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
rooms
cubbyholes
and
offices
once
she
gained
access
to
these
she
probably
would
be
safe
but
here
was
another
stair
she
must
go
up
only
partially
enshrouded
in
darkness
it
might
betray
her
dropping
on
hands
and
knees
she
began
to
climb
a
bit
of
glass
cut
her
stocking
she
did
not
notice
that
a
crumpled
sheet
of
paper
fluttered
away
that
was
maddening
a
broad
patch
of
light
from
far
above
her
head
threw
her
out
in
bold
relief
for
a
second
for
a
second
only
then
leaping
to
her
feet
she
raced
down
the
balcony
and
again
entered
the
shadows
pressing
a
hand
to
her
breast
to
still
her
heart
wild
beating
she
listened
intently
did
she
hear
yes
there
could
be
no
mistake
there
came
a
soft
the
footsteps
of
a
person
walking
on
tiptoes
like
one
of
those
mounted
tigers
come
to
life
she
thought
with
a
shudder
slowly
she
moved
along
the
wall
if
only
she
could
reach
a
door
if
she
only
could
but
that
door
was
a
distance
of
some
fifty
yards
away
could
she
make
it
stealthily
she
moved
forward
stopping
now
and
then
to
listen
she
caught
as
before
the
stealthy
of
footsteps
once
some
object
rattled
on
the
floor
and
she
heard
a
muffled
exclamation
then
she
caught
a
creaking
sound
was
he
mounting
the
stair
had
the
banister
creaked
now
she
was
twenty
yards
from
the
door
now
ten
now
five
and
now
now
she
gripped
its
casing
excitedly
she
swung
around
only
to
find
herself
facing
a
rusted
square
of
steel
the
labyrinth
of
rooms
was
closed
to
her
she
was
trapped
on
a
narrow
balcony
with
no
way
to
turn
for
escape
as
she
crouched
there
trembling
her
hand
touched
something
cold
her
skate
here
was
hope
if
the
worst
came
to
worst
here
was
a
formidable
weapon
and
she
was
possessed
of
the
power
to
swing
it
cautiously
she
drew
it
from
her
belt
then
crouching
low
gripping
the
small
end
she
waited
came
again
the
he
was
on
the
balcony
she
felt
sure
of
that
now
her
hand
gripped
the
skate
until
the
blade
cut
through
the
skin
but
still
she
crouched
there
waiting
when
florence
failed
to
return
marian
and
lucile
might
have
been
seen
pacing
the
floor
while
marian
pretended
to
study
and
made
a
failure
of
it
i
think
we
should
go
out
and
look
for
her
said
lucile
probably
just
a
bit
overcome
by
the
wonderful
skating
in
the
moonlight
answered
marian
in
what
was
intended
as
an
unworried
tone
but
we
go
down
to
the
lagoon
and
have
a
look
wait
just
a
moment
said
lucile
as
she
disappeared
inside
her
laboratory
when
she
returned
something
beneath
her
coat
bulged
but
marian
did
not
ask
her
what
it
might
be
after
dropping
down
the
rope
ladder
they
hurried
along
the
beach
and
across
the
park
to
the
lagoon
from
the
ridge
above
it
they
could
see
the
greater
part
of
the
lagoon
surface
not
a
single
moving
figure
darkened
its
surface
for
fully
five
minutes
they
stood
there
looking
listening
then
marian
led
the
way
to
the
edge
of
the
ice
by
the
side
of
a
clump
of
bushes
she
had
spied
something
what
that
pair
of
men
rubbers
replied
lucile
kicking
at
them
for
a
full
moment
the
two
stood
and
stared
at
one
another
she
she
is
down
here
said
lucile
at
last
perhaps
we
had
better
go
up
and
look
among
the
boats
silently
they
walked
back
to
where
the
hundred
boats
were
looming
in
the
dark
their
masts
like
slender
arms
reaching
for
the
moon
as
they
rounded
a
small
schooner
they
were
startled
by
a
footstep
do
be
afraid
it
is
only
i
called
a
friendly
voice
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
moonlight
wonderful
is
it
marian
recognized
the
young
man
of
the
schooner
mark
pence
she
had
talked
with
him
once
before
he
had
helped
her
home
with
her
two
dozen
cans
of
fruits
and
vegetables
having
liked
him
then
she
decided
to
trust
him
now
so
in
a
few
words
she
confided
their
fears
for
their
companion
safety
shucks
said
the
boy
that
be
all
right
she
show
up
all
right
probably
went
farther
than
she
intended
but
sure
i
take
a
turn
with
you
through
our
little
village
of
boats
be
glad
to
they
wandered
in
and
out
among
the
various
crafts
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
until
they
came
to
the
great
black
bulk
of
the
scow
inhabited
by
the
chinamen
i
rout
out
might
know
something
said
mark
he
knocked
several
times
but
received
no
response
he
was
about
to
enter
when
lucile
whispered
wait
a
minute
were
were
you
in
the
war
a
trifle
not
to
amount
to
much
know
how
to
use
a
gas
mask
well
rather
six
seconds
is
my
record
know
that
old
joke
about
the
and
the
dead
do
you
i
was
quick
lucile
smiled
she
was
holding
out
an
oblong
package
fastened
to
a
strap
also
a
small
glass
bottle
take
take
these
she
whispered
nervously
you
ca
tell
about
those
folks
break
the
bottle
if
they
go
after
you
then
put
on
the
mask
pretty
powerful
gas
but
does
no
permanent
injury
mark
smiled
as
he
slipped
the
strap
over
his
shoulder
nonsense
i
guess
he
murmured
but
might
not
be
just
like
going
over
the
top
you
never
can
tell
he
drew
a
small
flashlight
from
his
pocket
then
pushed
the
door
open
he
was
gone
for
what
to
the
girls
seemed
an
exceedingly
long
time
when
he
returned
he
had
little
enough
to
tell
not
a
soul
in
the
place
far
as
i
could
see
he
reported
but
man
oh
man
it
a
queer
old
cellar
smells
like
opium
and
and
talk
about
narrow
winding
stairs
why
i
bet
i
went
down
he
paused
to
stare
at
the
scow
why
that
tub
is
more
than
ten
feet
high
and
i
went
down
a
good
twenty
feet
rooms
and
rooms
in
it
something
queer
about
that
the
girls
were
too
anxious
for
florence
safety
to
give
much
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
well
we
are
greatly
obliged
to
you
said
lucile
taking
her
bottle
and
gas
mask
i
guess
there
nothing
to
do
but
go
back
to
the
yacht
and
wait
with
a
friendly
they
turned
and
made
their
way
back
to
the
o
moo
chapter
v
a
catastrophe
averted
as
florence
crouched
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
deserted
museum
many
and
wild
were
the
thoughts
that
sped
through
her
mind
could
she
do
it
if
worse
came
to
worst
could
she
strike
the
blow
she
had
the
power
the
muscles
of
her
arm
thanks
to
her
splendid
training
were
as
firm
as
those
of
a
man
yes
she
had
the
power
but
could
she
do
it
there
could
be
no
mincing
matters
strike
first
and
ask
questions
after
that
must
be
her
motto
in
such
an
extremity
there
would
be
ample
opportunity
a
beast
always
hunts
with
nose
close
to
the
ground
the
man
would
be
a
fair
mark
the
skate
was
as
perfect
a
weapon
as
one
might
ask
keen
and
powerful
as
a
sword
it
would
do
its
work
well
yet
after
all
did
she
have
the
nerve
while
this
problem
was
revolving
in
her
mind
the
of
footsteps
grew
more
and
more
distinct
her
heart
pounded
fearfully
coming
coming
coming
it
seemed
to
be
repeating
over
and
over
then
suddenly
there
flashed
through
her
mind
the
consequences
of
the
blow
she
must
strike
the
man
must
be
given
no
chance
to
fight
one
blow
must
render
him
unconscious
whatever
was
done
must
be
done
well
but
after
that
what
she
could
not
leave
him
alone
in
this
great
deserted
shell
of
a
building
neither
could
she
await
alone
his
return
to
consciousness
no
that
would
never
do
she
would
be
obliged
to
seek
aid
from
whom
the
police
to
be
sure
but
then
there
would
be
a
court
scene
and
a
story
just
such
a
story
as
cub
reporters
dote
on
she
saw
it
all
in
print
three
girls
living
in
a
boat
one
pursued
by
villain
an
amazon
this
modern
girl
she
brains
him
with
her
skate
yes
that
would
make
a
wonderful
news
story
and
after
that
would
come
such
publicity
as
would
put
an
end
to
their
happy
times
aboard
the
o
moo
that
would
mean
the
end
of
their
schooldays
just
when
they
were
becoming
engrossed
in
their
studies
when
they
had
just
begun
to
realize
the
vast
treasures
of
knowledge
which
was
locked
up
in
books
and
the
brains
of
wise
men
and
which
would
be
unlocked
to
them
little
by
little
if
only
they
were
able
to
remain
at
the
university
the
whole
thing
was
unthinkable
she
must
escape
she
must
not
strike
the
blow
there
must
be
another
way
out
yet
she
could
think
of
none
before
her
was
an
iron
railing
but
to
go
over
this
meant
a
drop
of
twenty
feet
beyond
her
at
the
end
of
the
balcony
towered
a
brick
wall
at
her
back
an
iron
door
to
her
left
there
sounded
ever
more
plainly
the
of
tiptoeing
feet
i
must
i
must
she
determined
her
teeth
set
hard
there
is
no
other
way
and
yet
even
as
she
expected
to
hear
the
shift
of
feet
which
told
of
a
turn
on
the
balcony
some
ten
feet
from
where
she
cowered
the
went
steadily
forward
she
could
not
believe
her
ears
what
had
happened
then
on
the
heels
of
this
revelation
there
followed
another
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
was
growing
fainter
of
a
sudden
the
truth
dawned
upon
her
the
man
was
not
on
the
balcony
he
had
not
ascended
the
stairs
he
was
still
on
the
floor
below
her
sense
of
location
had
been
distorted
by
the
vast
silence
of
the
place
she
was
for
the
moment
safe
a
wave
of
dizziness
swept
over
her
she
sank
into
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
floor
reviving
she
was
seized
with
an
almost
uncontrollable
desire
to
laugh
but
clenching
and
unclenching
her
hands
she
maintained
an
unbroken
silence
at
length
her
nerves
in
hand
once
more
she
settled
down
to
watchful
waiting
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
she
caught
every
new
move
of
the
prowler
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
died
away
in
the
distance
she
settled
herself
to
calmer
thoughts
this
place
she
was
in
was
a
vast
cathedral
of
gloom
when
the
moon
went
under
a
cloud
blotting
out
the
broad
circle
of
light
which
fell
from
the
vaulted
dome
the
darkness
was
so
profound
that
she
felt
she
must
scream
or
flee
yet
there
was
something
magnetic
about
the
place
she
might
have
been
held
there
even
though
she
were
not
pursued
it
was
a
place
to
dream
of
some
years
before
a
hundred
thousand
people
in
a
single
day
had
passed
in
and
out
along
the
aisles
of
this
vast
structure
that
had
been
in
the
days
of
its
glory
all
the
rich
the
poor
the
cultured
the
illiterate
the
laborer
the
street
gamin
had
peered
at
the
marvels
displayed
between
its
walls
and
now
now
two
beings
haunted
its
vast
corridors
the
one
pursuing
the
other
how
strange
life
was
a
whiff
of
wind
sweeping
over
the
main
floor
sent
a
whirl
of
waste
paper
flying
in
circles
halfway
to
the
ceiling
two
tiny
red
eyes
peered
at
her
at
a
safe
distance
then
another
and
another
rats
she
whispered
three
of
them
the
of
feet
became
distinct
again
putting
out
her
hand
to
grip
the
skate
she
discovered
that
her
fingers
were
too
stiff
for
service
she
had
grown
cold
without
sensing
it
rubbing
her
hands
together
she
warmed
them
her
limbs
too
had
grown
stiff
rising
silently
she
went
through
a
series
of
exercises
which
sent
the
blood
coursing
through
her
veins
must
get
out
of
here
some
way
she
told
herself
but
how
then
suddenly
she
thought
of
the
girls
they
would
be
anxious
about
her
might
come
out
to
seek
her
only
to
fall
into
a
trap
a
trap
she
thought
of
lucile
slim
nervous
lucile
hovering
as
she
had
in
the
corner
of
that
old
mission
on
that
other
night
thought
too
of
the
things
lucile
had
seen
there
admired
the
nerve
she
had
displayed
but
what
did
it
all
mean
she
could
but
feel
that
it
all
was
connected
in
some
way
the
note
of
warning
tacked
to
the
schooner
lucile
experience
in
the
mission
and
her
present
one
all
fitted
together
in
one
what
was
it
all
about
were
they
innocently
checkmating
or
appearing
to
checkmate
some
men
in
their
attempt
to
perform
some
unlawful
deed
were
these
persons
moonshiners
gamblers
smugglers
or
robbers
living
in
the
dry
dock
if
so
who
were
they
again
the
sound
of
footsteps
grew
indistinct
in
the
distance
ought
to
be
getting
out
of
here
she
told
herself
getting
late
horribly
late
and
and
cold
the
girls
will
be
searching
for
me
there
an
open
window
over
there
to
my
right
terribly
high
up
but
i
might
make
the
ground
though
she
listened
intently
but
caught
no
sound
then
stealthily
step
by
step
she
made
her
way
toward
the
window
now
she
was
fifty
feet
away
from
it
now
thirty
now
ten
and
now
now
she
dropped
silently
to
the
floor
and
crept
to
the
opening
there
was
no
glass
she
was
glad
of
that
flattening
herself
out
she
peered
over
the
sill
to
the
void
below
terribly
far
down
easily
thirty
feet
she
breathed
two
gratings
rotten
too
perhaps
ground
frozen
too
she
reached
far
down
and
gripping
the
top
of
the
nearest
window
grating
threw
all
her
strength
into
an
effort
to
wrench
it
free
that
one
strong
enough
she
concluded
but
how
about
the
other
again
she
lay
quite
still
listening
in
the
distance
she
fancied
she
caught
the
again
better
try
it
while
i
got
a
chance
she
decided
with
the
care
and
skill
of
a
trained
athlete
she
swung
herself
over
the
window
sill
clung
to
the
grating
with
her
toes
dropped
down
gripped
the
grating
with
her
hands
slid
her
feet
to
the
grating
below
tested
that
as
best
she
could
trusted
her
weight
to
it
swung
low
touched
the
ground
then
in
her
sped
away
toward
the
nearest
street
arrived
at
a
clump
of
bushes
which
skirted
the
street
she
sat
down
and
drew
on
her
shoes
then
with
a
loud
whew
she
crossed
the
street
and
made
her
way
toward
the
o
moo
over
a
roundabout
but
safe
route
which
led
her
by
the
doors
of
closed
shops
and
beneath
huge
apartments
where
some
of
chicago
thousands
were
sleeping
her
mind
as
she
hurried
on
was
deep
in
the
mystery
and
full
of
possible
plans
as
to
the
uncertain
future
i
suppose
she
mumbled
once
we
should
give
up
the
o
moo
most
people
would
say
it
was
a
wild
notion
this
living
on
a
ship
but
what
one
to
do
no
rooms
you
can
pay
for
and
who
would
give
up
a
university
education
without
a
fight
what
have
we
done
what
are
these
people
bothering
us
for
anyway
what
right
have
they
who
are
they
anyway
this
cast
her
into
deeper
reflections
the
face
she
had
seen
was
not
that
of
mark
pence
whether
it
was
one
of
the
orientals
living
on
the
scow
or
one
of
the
fishermen
living
in
their
fishing
smack
she
could
not
tell
she
had
never
seen
the
fishermen
even
marian
had
seen
but
two
of
them
might
not
be
any
of
these
she
concluded
with
a
shrug
might
have
been
some
night
prowler
who
will
never
come
back
the
two
girls
in
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
had
waited
an
hour
lucile
had
fallen
marian
had
lifted
a
trap
door
and
had
started
the
small
generator
which
furnished
them
light
and
heat
the
engine
was
racing
away
with
a
faint
when
lucile
sat
up
suddenly
marian
she
exclaimed
what
did
that
boy
say
about
the
scow
those
chinese
people
live
in
why
said
marian
wrinkling
her
brow
he
said
something
about
going
down
twenty
feet
that
seems
strange
does
it
lucile
considered
for
a
moment
yes
but
then
it
was
a
winding
stairway
probably
he
is
used
to
that
kind
perhaps
he
just
thought
it
was
farther
down
than
it
really
was
i
what
was
that
exclaimed
lucile
starting
up
there
had
come
a
muffled
sound
from
below
barely
heard
above
the
of
the
engine
in
a
second
marian
had
stopped
the
generator
each
girl
strained
her
ears
to
listen
it
came
again
this
time
more
distinct
a
pause
then
a
fourth
tap
florence
exclaimed
lucile
springing
for
the
door
three
taps
a
halt
then
a
tap
was
the
signal
for
lowering
the
a
moment
later
florence
was
being
dragged
into
the
cabin
and
ordered
to
give
an
account
of
herself
sit
down
she
said
it
rather
a
long
story
when
i
through
very
likely
be
for
leaving
the
o
moo
in
the
morning
and
i
not
so
sure
but
that
is
the
right
thing
to
do
the
cruise
of
the
o
moo
she
laughed
a
bit
uncertainly
gives
some
indication
of
turning
out
to
be
an
voyage
with
lucile
and
marian
listening
intently
florence
told
her
story
florence
said
lucile
when
she
had
finished
do
do
you
suppose
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
old
mission
affair
i
told
you
about
or
the
warning
tacked
on
our
hull
suggested
marian
i
do
know
said
florence
thoughtfully
it
might
the
point
really
is
though
are
we
leaving
in
the
morning
she
was
answered
by
an
emphatic
no
no
do
you
know
said
lucile
a
few
moments
later
as
she
sipped
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
and
nibbled
at
a
wafer
i
peeped
into
that
room
in
the
old
mission
yesterday
the
shutter
had
been
replaced
but
i
could
see
through
the
cracks
there
really
was
anything
on
the
table
the
candles
and
crucifix
were
there
but
nothing
on
the
old
table
not
anything
at
all
i
i
must
just
have
imagined
that
face
i
not
so
sure
said
florence
mysteriously
oh
exclaimed
lucile
suddenly
you
were
going
to
tell
me
the
story
that
face
reminded
you
of
the
story
told
by
an
old
seaman
i
will
said
florence
but
not
just
look
she
sprang
to
her
feet
it
after
three
and
is
already
chapter
vi
the
blue
god
as
florence
returned
from
her
lectures
the
following
afternoon
she
passed
across
the
end
of
the
lagoon
once
she
had
found
her
skate
lost
on
the
previous
night
and
thrust
it
into
the
bag
with
her
books
she
glanced
up
at
the
ragged
giant
of
a
building
which
lay
sleeping
there
on
its
blanket
of
snow
she
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
again
to
enter
and
roam
about
its
deserted
corridors
walking
to
the
corner
beneath
the
broken
windows
she
glanced
to
the
right
and
left
of
her
allowed
her
gaze
to
sweep
the
horizon
then
seeing
no
one
who
might
observe
her
actions
she
sprang
upon
the
edge
of
the
wall
scaled
the
grating
with
the
agility
of
a
squirrel
tumbled
over
the
upper
window
sill
and
found
herself
once
more
inside
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
now
broad
daylight
and
would
be
for
an
hour
she
found
her
heart
fluttering
painfully
the
experiences
of
the
previous
night
were
all
too
freshly
burned
on
the
tissues
of
her
brain
as
she
tiptoed
down
the
balcony
then
dropped
from
step
to
step
to
the
main
floor
below
the
unpleasant
sensations
left
her
she
found
herself
walking
as
she
had
some
years
before
as
a
child
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
exclaiming
at
every
newly
discovered
monster
or
thing
of
delicate
beauty
the
treasures
had
long
since
been
removed
to
newer
and
more
magnificent
quarters
but
the
memory
of
them
lingered
she
was
wandering
along
thus
absorbed
when
her
foot
touched
something
thinking
it
but
a
stray
brick
or
crumbling
bit
of
plaster
she
was
about
to
bestow
upon
it
only
a
passing
glance
when
with
a
sudden
exclamation
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
the
thing
at
first
sight
appeared
to
be
but
a
bundle
of
soiled
silk
cloth
of
a
peculiar
blue
tint
florence
knew
however
that
it
was
more
than
that
for
when
her
toe
had
struck
it
she
had
thought
it
some
solid
object
with
trembling
fingers
she
tore
away
the
silk
threads
which
bound
it
to
uncover
a
curious
object
of
blue
stone
shaped
like
a
short
squat
candlestick
indeed
there
were
traces
of
tallow
to
be
seen
in
the
cuplike
hollow
at
the
top
of
it
looks
like
it
might
be
blue
jade
she
told
herself
if
it
is
worth
something
the
whisper
died
on
her
lips
a
thought
had
come
to
her
one
which
made
her
afraid
of
the
gathering
darkness
and
caused
her
to
hastily
thrust
the
thing
into
the
pocket
of
her
coat
and
hurry
from
the
building
that
night
after
the
dinner
dishes
were
washed
florence
who
had
been
fumbling
with
something
in
the
corner
suddenly
turned
out
the
lights
scratching
a
match
she
lighted
the
half
of
a
candle
which
she
had
thrust
into
the
candlestick
she
had
found
in
the
museum
gather
round
children
she
said
solemnly
placing
the
candle
on
the
floor
she
sat
down
before
it
gather
round
she
repeated
and
you
shall
hear
the
tale
of
the
strange
blue
god
it
is
told
best
while
seated
in
the
floor
as
the
negontisks
sit
with
legs
crossed
it
is
told
best
by
the
dim
and
flaring
light
of
a
candle
oh
good
exclaimed
lucile
dropping
down
beside
her
but
where
did
you
get
the
odd
candlestick
asked
marian
as
she
followed
lucile
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
made
of
some
almost
transparent
blue
stone
and
see
little
faces
peer
out
at
you
from
every
angle
it
is
as
if
a
hundred
wicked
fairies
had
been
bottled
up
in
it
all
that
marian
had
said
was
true
and
even
florence
stared
at
it
a
long
time
before
she
answered
found
it
in
the
old
museum
probably
left
behind
when
the
displays
were
moved
out
i
ought
to
take
it
down
to
the
new
museum
and
ask
them
i
guess
there
was
something
in
florence
tone
which
told
lucile
that
she
herself
did
not
believe
half
she
was
saying
but
she
did
not
give
voice
to
those
thoughts
instead
she
whispered
come
now
let
us
have
the
story
of
the
blue
god
as
the
old
seaman
told
it
to
me
said
florence
it
was
like
this
he
had
been
shanghaied
by
a
whaler
captain
whose
ship
was
to
cruise
the
coast
of
arctic
siberia
so
cruel
and
unjust
was
this
captain
that
the
sailor
resolved
to
escape
at
the
first
opportunity
that
opportunity
came
one
day
when
he
with
others
had
been
sent
ashore
on
the
asiatic
continent
somewhere
between
korea
and
behring
straits
slipping
away
when
no
one
was
looking
he
hid
on
the
edge
of
a
rocky
cliff
until
he
saw
the
whaler
heave
anchor
and
sail
away
at
first
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
the
place
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
it
was
summer
however
and
there
were
solman
berries
on
the
tundra
and
blueberries
in
the
hills
there
were
an
abundance
of
wild
birds
eggs
to
be
gathered
on
the
ledges
the
meat
of
young
birds
was
tender
and
good
so
he
fared
well
enough
but
not
forgetting
that
summer
would
soon
pass
and
his
food
supply
be
gone
he
made
his
way
southward
until
at
last
he
came
within
sight
of
the
camp
fires
of
a
village
it
was
with
much
fear
that
he
approached
these
strangers
he
found
them
friendly
enough
ready
to
share
food
and
shelter
with
him
providing
he
was
willing
to
share
their
labor
you
would
care
to
hear
of
his
life
among
these
natives
only
the
part
relating
to
the
blue
god
is
of
importance
he
found
that
these
people
worshipped
a
strange
god
or
idol
this
idol
was
a
very
ugly
face
carved
out
of
a
block
of
solid
blue
jade
when
being
worshipped
it
was
always
illumined
by
some
strange
light
which
caused
it
to
appear
to
smile
and
frown
at
alternating
intervals
lucile
leaned
over
and
gripped
the
speaker
arm
see
how
the
faces
in
the
candlestick
smile
and
frown
she
shuddered
florence
smiled
and
nodded
then
proceeded
with
her
story
little
by
little
as
these
people
who
called
themselves
negontisks
who
lived
in
skin
tents
and
traveled
in
skin
boats
as
the
eskimos
do
and
are
considered
by
some
to
be
the
forefathers
of
the
eskimos
came
to
have
confidence
in
the
seaman
they
told
him
the
story
of
the
blue
god
so
ancient
was
this
god
that
not
the
oldest
man
in
the
village
could
recall
the
time
when
it
had
first
been
accepted
as
their
god
they
did
know
however
that
one
time
when
there
were
but
five
villages
of
their
tribe
and
when
all
these
villagers
had
joined
in
a
great
feast
of
white
whale
meat
and
sour
berries
on
a
slope
at
the
foot
of
a
great
mountain
a
huge
rock
had
come
rattling
down
from
the
cliffs
above
and
passing
through
their
midst
had
crushed
to
death
five
of
their
number
as
is
the
custom
with
most
barbaric
tribes
these
people
considered
that
anything
which
had
the
power
to
destroy
them
must
be
a
god
this
rock
which
proved
to
be
of
blue
jade
became
their
god
and
that
they
might
have
it
ever
with
them
as
they
traveled
that
it
might
protect
them
and
bring
them
good
fortune
they
carved
from
it
five
hollow
faces
like
masks
one
of
these
was
taken
by
each
village
then
they
went
their
way
from
that
day
so
the
story
goes
the
negontisk
people
were
greatly
prospered
they
found
food
in
abundance
no
longer
were
there
starving
times
they
had
children
in
numbers
and
all
these
lived
to
grow
to
manhood
as
the
tribe
grew
they
wished
to
create
new
villages
they
returned
to
the
place
of
the
rock
for
new
gods
only
to
find
that
the
rock
had
vanished
their
medicine
men
explained
that
being
a
god
the
rock
had
the
power
of
going
where
it
pleased
so
there
could
be
only
five
blue
gods
but
the
people
lived
on
and
prospered
as
the
years
passed
many
cruel
practices
grew
up
in
connection
with
the
worship
of
these
gods
some
of
them
are
so
terrible
that
the
old
seaman
would
not
tell
me
of
them
one
however
he
did
tell
that
was
that
all
the
illuminations
of
the
gods
were
held
in
a
tent
made
of
many
thicknesses
of
skins
only
men
were
permitted
to
be
present
during
the
illumination
the
life
of
a
woman
or
child
who
chanced
to
look
into
the
tent
at
such
a
time
must
be
sacrificed
their
blood
must
be
spilled
before
the
face
of
the
blue
god
very
strange
sort
of
she
broke
off
abruptly
to
exclaim
why
lucile
what
makes
you
tremble
so
nothing
i
guess
lucile
tried
to
smile
but
made
a
poor
attempt
at
it
it
it
ridiculous
i
know
she
stammered
but
you
know
i
saw
a
blue
face
illumined
and
i
am
a
girl
so
nonsense
pure
nonsense
exclaimed
marian
you
are
in
america
chicago
this
story
comes
from
siberia
probably
not
one
of
those
tribesmen
has
ever
set
foot
on
the
american
continent
let
alone
in
chicago
and
if
they
did
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
our
authorities
would
allow
them
to
continue
to
perform
these
terrible
religious
rites
florence
was
silent
suddenly
lucile
whispered
listen
what
was
that
for
a
moment
the
room
was
silent
only
the
faint
of
the
clock
in
the
wall
disturbed
the
stillness
then
faintly
from
outside
there
sounded
a
sort
of
metallic
jingle
someone
out
there
below
whispered
marian
he
has
kicked
that
tin
can
i
threw
out
there
the
third
can
of
corn
remember
the
answer
was
a
faint
ah
then
again
all
was
silence
two
or
three
moments
had
elapsed
when
there
came
a
faint
scratching
sound
seemingly
upon
the
side
of
the
yacht
last
time
said
marian
setting
her
teeth
tight
he
got
away
with
his
note
tacking
this
time
he
shall
not
tiptoeing
down
the
room
without
the
least
sound
she
climbed
upon
her
berth
which
was
made
up
for
the
night
by
propping
herself
upright
on
her
knees
she
could
just
see
through
a
small
circular
window
this
window
was
directly
opposite
the
opening
made
by
propping
up
the
canvas
florence
had
placed
herself
between
marian
and
the
candle
no
light
fell
upon
marian
to
betray
her
presence
when
one
is
in
a
dark
room
at
night
he
may
peer
into
the
moonlit
outer
world
without
being
seen
marian
had
poised
there
motionless
for
a
full
moment
when
without
altering
her
position
other
than
turning
her
head
she
whispered
lucile
bring
me
that
bottle
of
gas
understanding
at
once
what
bottle
was
meant
lucile
tiptoed
down
the
length
of
the
room
managed
to
open
the
laboratory
door
without
noise
then
put
her
hand
to
the
shelf
where
the
quick
action
gas
was
kept
with
this
in
her
hand
she
returned
to
marian
she
whispered
as
she
passed
it
up
to
her
be
careful
not
to
drop
it
in
here
it
would
drive
us
all
out
and
hardly
dressed
for
that
shrugging
her
shoulders
beneath
her
dressing
gown
marian
placed
the
bottle
on
the
blankets
then
reached
for
the
catch
which
kept
the
window
closed
this
window
was
seldom
opened
and
she
was
not
sure
but
that
the
unused
hinges
would
give
out
a
rusty
squeak
in
this
case
her
purpose
would
be
thwarted
she
could
but
try
catching
her
breath
she
turned
the
handle
then
gave
a
slight
pull
to
her
immense
relief
there
came
no
sound
as
the
window
swung
inward
seizing
the
bottle
she
brought
her
hand
even
with
her
head
then
sat
poised
there
quite
motionless
as
if
impersonating
the
statue
of
a
thrower
then
suddenly
her
whole
body
became
tense
the
hand
holding
the
bottle
flew
back
it
shot
forward
chapter
vii
the
mystery
deepens
when
they
saw
marian
hand
go
back
for
the
throw
the
two
other
girls
their
fear
overcome
by
curiosity
sprang
silently
to
a
position
beside
their
companion
what
they
saw
made
them
draw
back
in
fright
two
rounds
of
a
ladder
extended
above
the
outer
rim
of
the
boat
above
the
last
round
appeared
a
face
this
face
though
almost
completely
hidden
by
a
heavy
muffler
was
undoubtedly
that
of
a
man
before
they
had
time
to
move
however
they
saw
the
bottle
of
liquid
gas
strike
the
top
rail
and
burst
the
liquid
spattering
over
the
man
face
and
clothing
brought
forth
a
sharp
exclamation
the
next
instant
seeming
to
struggle
against
an
invisible
foe
he
made
desperate
attempts
to
dismount
from
his
lofty
position
in
this
he
was
partially
successful
he
disappeared
from
sight
but
the
next
moment
there
came
the
thud
of
a
falling
body
the
ladder
was
still
in
position
the
three
girls
held
their
breath
he
fell
said
lucile
in
a
tremulous
whisper
i
only
hope
he
no
you
do
lucile
interrupted
no
one
wishes
a
person
seriously
injured
lucile
shuddered
well
anyway
he
was
said
florence
for
there
he
is
the
gas
is
working
splendidly
the
man
was
dancing
about
below
swinging
his
arms
and
shouting
madly
like
a
drunken
man
whispered
marian
with
a
frightened
laugh
he
be
over
it
in
a
minute
said
lucile
liquid
all
over
his
clothes
keeps
evaporating
and
getting
into
his
lungs
true
to
lucile
prophecy
the
man
a
few
moments
later
having
calmed
down
appeared
to
pause
to
consider
it
was
evident
that
he
wavered
between
two
opinions
twice
he
started
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
each
time
sending
cold
chills
creeping
up
lucile
spine
we
have
no
more
gas
she
whispered
make
it
sulphuric
acid
this
time
marian
whispered
savagely
no
no
you
could
lucile
shuddered
pausing
each
time
the
man
turned
back
the
second
time
he
wheeled
about
and
racing
madly
down
the
beach
disappeared
beyond
a
long
line
of
pleasure
boats
well
said
florence
gathering
her
dressing
gown
about
her
and
springing
through
the
window
we
have
a
ladder
looks
like
a
good
one
it
a
good
one
she
exclaimed
a
moment
later
a
brand
new
one
we
show
it
to
timmie
perhaps
it
will
serve
as
evidence
to
trap
the
rascal
speaking
of
rascals
said
marian
a
few
moments
later
as
they
sat
looking
at
one
another
in
silence
what
do
you
think
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
perhaps
he
came
for
the
blue
candlestick
lucile
suggested
how
could
he
demanded
florence
how
would
he
know
we
had
it
what
would
he
want
of
it
it
only
a
curio
belongs
to
the
museum
i
guess
anyway
i
see
i
going
to
take
it
to
the
new
museum
and
show
it
to
one
of
the
curators
a
cole
i
met
him
at
a
party
on
the
campus
a
short
while
ago
suddenly
lucile
sprang
to
her
feet
then
rushed
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
wha
what
the
matter
demanded
marian
going
to
prepare
some
more
gas
lucile
called
back
over
her
shoulder
nothing
like
having
a
little
chemist
in
the
family
these
days
gas
is
almost
as
useful
in
times
of
peace
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
war
next
morning
marian
showed
the
ladder
to
the
aged
dry
dock
keeper
no
he
said
after
examining
it
carefully
i
never
saw
that
before
it
new
and
not
very
heavy
probably
bought
for
the
purpose
and
carried
here
you
say
you
did
see
the
man
face
not
much
of
it
would
recognize
him
probably
not
well
i
go
round
and
see
the
folks
close
to
here
that
sell
ladders
but
i
guess
it
wo
be
any
use
there
too
many
places
where
you
can
get
ladders
in
a
big
city
like
this
he
might
stole
it
too
mighty
queer
he
shook
his
head
as
he
walked
away
that
same
day
florence
wrapped
the
blue
candlestick
carefully
in
tissue
paper
snapped
three
rubber
bands
about
it
then
made
her
way
with
it
to
the
surface
line
where
she
took
a
car
for
down
town
she
kept
a
close
watch
to
the
right
to
the
left
and
back
of
her
for
any
signs
of
being
followed
she
scrutinized
the
faces
of
those
who
entered
the
car
with
her
and
even
cast
a
glance
behind
the
car
to
see
if
there
chanced
to
be
a
taxi
following
truth
was
the
events
of
the
last
hours
had
played
havoc
with
her
nerves
the
candlestick
in
her
possession
was
like
the
presence
of
some
supernatural
thing
it
haunted
her
even
in
the
day
as
a
thought
of
ghosts
in
a
lonely
spot
at
night
might
have
tormented
her
it
was
with
a
distinct
sense
of
relief
that
after
leaving
the
car
and
passing
over
a
half
mile
of
she
entered
the
massive
door
of
the
new
museum
for
a
moment
after
entering
she
permitted
her
eyes
to
roam
up
and
down
its
vast
corridors
to
catch
the
echo
of
voices
which
came
murmuring
to
her
from
everywhere
she
saw
the
massive
pillars
the
polished
floors
the
miles
of
glass
cases
then
a
distinct
sense
of
sorrow
swept
over
her
a
feeling
of
pity
for
the
ragged
giant
of
a
building
out
by
the
lake
front
which
had
once
housed
all
these
treasures
of
beauty
antiquity
and
wealth
temporary
temporary
kept
running
through
her
mind
too
hastily
built
and
of
poor
material
now
it
is
abandoned
to
decay
life
is
like
that
that
why
one
should
struggle
to
lay
foundations
to
prepare
one
self
for
life
for
eighteen
years
without
education
one
may
be
good
enough
then
like
the
old
museum
one
is
cast
aside
abandoned
to
decay
as
these
thoughts
swept
through
her
mind
she
resolved
more
strongly
than
before
that
come
what
might
she
would
continue
her
battle
for
a
university
education
suddenly
recalling
her
mission
she
asked
the
attendant
to
tell
her
where
she
might
find
cole
cole
office
said
the
man
courteously
is
in
the
left
wing
third
floor
see
those
stairs
at
the
other
end
of
this
hall
yes
take
those
stairs
go
to
the
third
floor
at
the
last
landing
go
straight
ahead
his
door
is
the
fourth
to
your
right
thank
you
and
florence
hurried
on
her
way
a
moment
later
she
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
great
studio
why
it
miss
huyler
he
exclaimed
as
he
opened
the
door
to
her
come
right
in
what
may
i
do
for
you
ruthaford
cole
was
one
of
those
rare
men
who
have
studied
their
subject
so
thoroughly
and
who
have
traveled
so
widely
in
search
of
further
knowledge
that
they
have
no
need
to
assume
a
false
air
of
importance
and
dignity
to
make
an
impression
under
middle
age
smiling
he
carried
the
attitude
of
a
boy
who
has
picked
up
a
few
facts
here
and
there
and
who
is
eager
to
learn
more
but
show
him
a
bit
of
carving
from
the
congo
and
he
is
all
smiles
oh
yes
a
very
nice
bit
of
modern
work
good
enough
but
done
to
sell
to
traders
possesses
no
historical
value
you
know
a
bit
of
ivory
from
the
coast
of
alaska
rudely
scratched
here
and
there
a
hole
torn
out
here
an
end
broken
off
there
browned
with
age
is
presented
and
he
answers
his
face
lighting
up
with
genuine
joy
now
there
is
really
a
rare
specimen
handle
of
a
made
long
before
the
white
man
came
i
say
tells
stories
that
does
each
crudely
scratched
representation
of
reindeer
whale
wolf
or
bear
has
its
meaning
that
was
the
type
of
man
cole
was
frank
and
friendly
to
all
he
gave
evidence
in
an
unassuming
way
of
a
tremendous
fund
of
knowledge
now
as
florence
unwrapped
the
blue
candlestick
he
watched
the
movement
of
her
hands
with
much
the
same
look
that
a
terrier
wears
when
watching
his
master
dig
out
a
rat
once
the
candlestick
was
in
his
hand
he
held
it
as
a
merchant
might
a
bit
of
costly
and
fragile
florence
smiled
as
she
watched
him
she
had
hoped
he
would
say
at
first
glance
why
where
did
you
chance
to
find
that
it
was
lost
from
one
of
our
cases
while
we
were
moving
we
believed
it
stolen
florence
had
had
quite
enough
of
adventure
and
mystery
she
was
convinced
that
holding
this
trophy
she
was
sure
to
experience
more
trouble
cole
did
not
do
the
expected
thing
what
he
did
was
to
turn
the
candlestick
over
and
over
a
look
of
amazement
spread
over
his
usually
smiling
face
no
he
murmured
it
ca
be
two
more
turns
he
held
it
to
the
light
and
yet
it
does
seem
to
be
stepping
to
a
door
which
led
to
a
balcony
with
an
pardon
me
he
disappeared
through
the
door
but
florence
could
still
see
him
as
he
held
the
thing
to
the
light
turning
turning
and
turning
it
again
the
look
of
amazement
grew
on
his
face
as
he
the
room
he
exclaimed
it
is
it
most
certainly
is
i
am
astounded
motioning
florence
to
a
seat
he
dropped
into
the
swivel
chair
before
his
desk
for
a
moment
he
sat
staring
at
the
candlestick
then
he
asked
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
found
this
in
the
old
museum
the
old
museum
yes
i
thought
you
might
have
lost
no
no
he
interrupted
we
never
possessed
one
of
these
there
is
one
in
the
metropolitan
museum
it
the
only
one
i
ever
saw
save
one
i
chanced
upon
on
the
east
coast
of
russia
i
tried
to
buy
it
from
the
natives
they
would
not
name
a
price
decamped
that
very
night
utterly
disappeared
thought
we
might
steal
it
i
suppose
suspicious
superstitious
lot
the
question
is
he
said
after
a
moment
now
you
have
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
why
smiled
florence
return
it
to
the
owner
if
if
he
can
be
found
the
owner
cole
eyes
narrowed
i
fancy
will
not
call
for
it
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
were
you
to
advertise
your
find
in
the
papers
he
would
not
venture
to
call
for
it
and
yet
he
said
thoughtfully
it
might
be
worth
trying
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
a
brown
study
miss
huyler
he
said
abruptly
this
is
a
strange
affair
i
am
not
at
liberty
at
the
present
moment
to
tell
you
all
i
know
one
thing
is
sure
it
is
not
safe
for
you
to
be
carrying
this
thing
about
for
in
the
first
place
it
is
valuable
and
in
valuable
that
exclaimed
the
girl
quite
valuable
well
worth
stealing
i
almost
be
tempted
myself
he
smiled
but
there
is
another
reason
why
it
is
not
safe
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
but
if
you
will
trust
me
with
it
i
will
place
it
in
one
of
the
gem
cases
our
gem
room
is
guarded
day
and
night
it
will
be
safe
there
and
neither
it
nor
you
will
be
safe
if
you
keep
it
by
the
way
he
broke
off
suddenly
what
is
your
address
florence
gave
the
address
of
a
friend
where
her
mail
was
left
you
live
there
no
but
no
mail
is
delivered
where
i
do
live
where
can
that
be
he
asked
in
some
surprise
in
a
boat
she
smiled
in
a
pleasure
yacht
oh
it
not
afloat
as
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
might
i
ask
the
name
of
the
boat
and
the
location
he
half
apologized
someone
might
wish
to
visit
you
it
will
be
proper
and
very
important
that
he
should
otherwise
i
would
not
ask
the
o
moo
answered
florence
quietly
foot
of
street
she
rose
to
go
he
grasped
her
hand
for
a
second
looking
as
if
he
would
like
to
say
more
then
bowed
her
out
of
the
door
as
she
entered
the
corridor
she
was
conscious
of
a
strange
dizziness
it
was
as
if
she
had
spent
the
better
part
of
a
night
poring
over
an
absorbing
story
she
had
come
to
the
museum
to
rid
herself
of
the
blue
candlestick
and
the
mystery
attached
to
it
the
candlestick
was
gone
but
the
mystery
lay
before
her
deeper
and
darker
than
ever
chapter
viii
a
strange
game
of
the
next
short
chapter
in
the
story
of
the
mystery
of
the
blue
candlestick
followed
closely
upon
florence
visit
to
the
new
museum
it
was
on
the
following
morning
as
she
and
lucile
were
strapping
up
their
books
preparatory
to
leaving
the
o
moo
that
they
heard
a
sudden
loud
rapping
on
the
hull
of
the
yacht
who
can
that
be
exclaimed
lucile
i
see
said
florence
racing
for
the
door
much
to
her
astonishment
as
she
peered
down
over
the
rail
she
found
herself
looking
into
the
blue
eyes
of
a
strapping
police
sergeant
florence
huyler
he
questioned
ye
yes
she
stammered
how
do
i
git
up
he
asked
or
do
you
prefer
to
come
down
got
ta
speak
with
you
nothin
serious
not
for
you
he
added
as
he
saw
the
startled
look
on
her
face
with
trembling
hand
florence
threw
the
rope
ladder
over
the
rail
as
the
officer
set
the
ladder
groaning
beneath
his
weight
questions
flew
through
her
mind
what
does
he
want
will
he
forbid
us
living
in
the
o
moo
what
have
we
done
to
deserve
a
visit
from
the
police
then
like
a
flash
cole
words
came
back
to
her
someone
else
may
wish
to
talk
with
you
that
someone
must
be
this
policeman
will
you
come
in
she
asked
as
the
officer
foot
touched
the
deck
if
you
please
you
see
he
began
at
once
while
his
keen
eyes
roamed
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
cabin
my
visit
has
to
do
with
a
bit
of
a
curio
you
found
lately
the
blue
candlestick
suggested
florence
exactly
i
we
really
do
know
much
you
may
know
more
than
you
think
now
sit
down
nice
and
easy
and
tell
me
all
you
do
know
and
about
all
the
queer
things
that
have
happened
to
you
since
you
came
to
live
in
this
here
boat
florence
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
then
told
in
dramatic
fashion
of
her
adventures
in
the
old
museum
exactly
said
the
officer
emphatically
when
she
had
finished
queer
mighty
queer
now
was
it
and
now
is
that
all
lucile
my
friend
here
had
a
rather
strange
experience
in
the
spanish
mission
perhaps
she
tell
you
of
it
lucile
face
went
first
white
then
red
oh
that
that
was
nothing
i
i
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
i
guess
you
see
she
explained
to
the
officer
i
had
been
out
in
the
storm
so
long
i
was
sort
of
benumbed
with
the
cold
and
when
i
got
inside
i
fell
asleep
and
then
the
officer
prompted
with
an
encouraging
smile
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
tell
encouraged
florence
stammering
and
blushing
at
first
lucile
launched
into
her
story
gaining
in
confidence
as
she
went
on
she
succeeded
in
telling
it
very
well
when
she
came
to
the
part
about
the
blue
face
in
his
eagerness
to
drink
in
every
detail
the
officer
leaned
forward
half
rising
from
his
chair
hold
on
he
exclaimed
excitedly
you
say
it
was
a
blue
face
yes
blue
i
am
sure
of
that
blue
like
the
candlestick
why
yes
yes
i
think
it
was
ca
be
any
mistake
he
mumbled
to
himself
as
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
it
it
that
all
would
i
like
to
have
been
there
all
right
he
urged
go
on
lucile
finished
her
story
and
is
that
all
he
repeated
all
except
something
that
happened
the
night
florence
was
caught
in
the
old
museum
and
did
get
home
said
lucile
but
what
happened
much
you
see
we
went
out
to
search
for
her
and
a
boy
named
mark
pence
who
lives
in
a
boat
here
too
joined
us
we
could
rouse
anyone
at
the
old
scow
where
the
chinamen
live
so
he
went
in
he
did
find
anyone
but
when
he
came
out
he
said
it
was
such
a
queer
sort
of
place
he
said
there
was
a
winding
stairway
in
it
twenty
feet
high
but
i
guess
he
does
know
much
about
winding
stairways
because
the
scow
is
only
ten
feet
high
altogether
so
the
stairs
could
be
twenty
feet
deep
could
they
the
officer
who
had
again
half
risen
from
his
chair
settled
back
no
he
said
no
of
course
they
could
but
florence
who
had
been
studying
his
face
thought
he
attached
far
greater
importance
to
this
last
incident
than
his
words
would
seem
to
indicate
well
if
that
all
he
said
rising
i
be
going
you
shed
a
lot
of
light
upon
a
very
mysterious
subject
one
which
has
been
bothering
the
whole
police
force
i
from
the
street
station
if
anything
further
happens
let
me
know
at
once
will
you
call
for
sergeant
malloney
and
if
ever
you
need
any
protection
by
day
or
night
the
station
at
your
service
good
day
and
thank
you
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
florence
as
the
officer
broad
back
disappeared
beyond
the
black
bulk
of
a
tug
in
dry
dock
i
i
do
know
what
to
think
said
lucile
one
thing
i
awfully
sure
of
though
and
that
is
that
living
on
a
boat
is
more
exciting
than
one
would
imagine
before
trying
it
i
wish
said
lucile
that
night
as
she
lay
curled
up
in
her
favorite
chair
that
i
could
create
something
i
wish
i
could
write
a
story
a
real
story
then
for
a
long
time
she
was
silent
professor
storris
she
began
again
told
us
just
how
a
short
story
ought
to
be
done
first
you
find
an
unusual
setting
for
your
story
something
that
has
been
described
before
then
you
imagine
some
very
unusual
events
occurring
in
that
setting
that
makes
a
story
only
you
need
a
little
technique
there
must
be
three
parts
to
the
story
you
look
about
in
the
story
and
find
the
very
most
dramatic
point
in
the
narrative
fearfully
exciting
and
dramatic
you
begin
the
story
right
there
do
tell
how
things
come
to
be
happening
so
nor
why
the
hero
was
there
or
anything
just
plunge
right
into
it
like
perspiration
stood
out
upon
his
brow
a
chill
ran
down
his
spine
his
eyes
were
glued
upon
the
two
burning
orbs
of
fire
he
was
paralyzed
with
fear
florence
looked
up
and
laughed
that
ought
to
get
them
interested
trouble
is
said
lucile
thoughtfully
it
hard
to
find
an
unusual
setting
and
the
unusual
incidents
after
you
done
two
or
three
hundred
words
of
thrill
she
went
on
then
you
keep
the
hero
in
a
most
horrible
plight
while
his
mind
runs
like
lightning
back
over
the
events
which
brought
him
to
this
dramatic
moment
in
his
career
then
you
suddenly
take
up
the
thrill
again
and
bring
the
story
up
to
the
climax
with
a
bang
simple
is
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
do
it
only
you
must
concentrate
concentrate
tremendously
all
the
while
you
doing
it
for
a
long
while
after
that
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
quite
silent
so
silent
indeed
that
her
companions
thought
her
asleep
but
after
nearly
an
hour
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
sudden
enthusiasm
i
have
it
three
girls
living
in
a
yacht
in
dry
dock
that
an
unusual
setting
and
the
unusual
incident
i
have
that
too
but
i
sha
tell
it
that
to
be
the
surprise
the
other
girls
were
preparing
to
retire
lucile
took
down
her
hair
slipped
on
a
loose
arranged
a
dark
shade
over
her
lamp
then
having
taken
a
quantity
of
paper
from
a
drawer
and
sharpened
six
pencils
she
sat
down
to
write
when
she
commenced
it
was
ten
by
the
clock
built
into
the
running
board
at
the
end
of
the
cabin
when
she
came
to
an
end
and
threw
the
last
dulled
pencil
from
her
it
was
one
for
a
moment
she
shuffled
the
papers
into
an
oblong
heap
then
throwing
aside
her
and
snapping
off
the
light
she
climbed
to
her
berth
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
but
even
in
her
dreams
she
appeared
to
be
experiencing
the
incidents
of
her
story
for
now
she
moved
restlessly
murmuring
how
the
boat
pitches
or
listen
to
the
wind
howl
a
moment
later
she
sat
bolt
upright
exclaiming
in
a
shrill
whisper
it
ice
i
tell
you
it
ice
marian
was
the
first
one
up
in
the
morning
it
was
her
turn
for
making
toast
and
coffee
as
she
passed
lucile
desk
she
glanced
at
the
stock
of
paper
and
unconsciously
read
the
title
the
cruise
of
the
o
moo
gladly
would
she
have
read
the
pages
which
followed
but
loyalty
to
her
cousin
forbade
said
lucile
at
breakfast
i
am
going
to
have
my
story
typed
and
next
day
i
shall
take
it
to
the
office
of
the
literary
monthly
i
hope
the
editor
treats
you
kindly
smiled
marian
you
must
remember
though
that
we
are
only
freshmen
but
lucile
faith
in
her
product
her
first
real
creation
was
not
to
be
daunted
i
did
it
just
as
professor
storris
said
it
should
be
done
so
i
know
it
must
be
good
she
affirmed
stoutly
that
night
lucile
spent
an
hour
working
over
the
typewritten
copy
of
her
story
tracing
in
a
word
here
marking
one
out
there
punctuating
comparing
rearranging
she
made
it
as
perfect
as
her
limited
knowledge
of
the
story
writing
art
would
permit
her
there
now
she
sighed
tossing
back
the
hair
which
tumbled
down
over
her
shapely
shoulders
i
will
take
you
to
ye
editor
in
ye
morning
and
here
hoping
he
treats
you
well
she
patted
the
manuscript
affectionately
then
stowed
it
away
in
a
if
the
truth
were
to
be
told
she
was
due
for
something
of
a
surprise
regarding
that
manuscript
but
all
that
lay
in
the
future
florence
and
marian
were
away
they
had
gone
for
a
spin
on
the
lagoon
before
retiring
she
was
alone
on
the
o
moo
tossing
her
lightly
from
her
she
proceeded
to
put
herself
through
a
series
of
exercises
such
as
are
calculated
to
bring
color
to
the
cheek
and
sparkle
to
the
eye
of
a
modern
american
girl
coming
out
of
this
with
glowing
face
and
heaving
chest
she
threw
on
her
and
leaped
out
of
the
cabin
and
into
the
moonlight
which
flooded
a
narrow
open
spot
on
deck
away
at
the
left
she
saw
the
ice
on
the
lake
shore
stand
out
in
irregular
piles
here
was
a
huge
pile
twenty
feet
high
and
there
a
single
cake
on
end
there
was
a
whole
forest
of
jagged
edges
and
here
again
pile
after
pile
lay
scattered
like
shocks
of
grain
in
the
field
for
all
the
world
like
the
arctic
she
breathed
what
sport
it
would
be
to
play
with
oneself
out
there
in
the
moonlight
she
paused
a
moment
in
thought
then
clapping
her
hands
she
exclaimed
i
do
it
it
will
be
like
going
back
to
good
old
cape
prince
of
wales
in
alaska
hastening
inside
she
twisted
her
hair
in
a
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
drew
on
some
warm
garments
crowned
herself
with
a
and
was
away
toward
the
beach
since
the
o
moo
was
on
the
track
nearest
to
the
shore
she
was
but
a
moment
reaching
the
edge
of
the
ice
which
packed
thick
between
two
breakwaters
lay
glistening
away
in
the
moonlight
here
she
hesitated
she
was
not
sure
it
was
quite
safe
the
wind
had
been
blowing
on
shore
for
days
it
had
brought
the
in
under
similar
conditions
in
the
arctic
the
ice
would
have
been
solidly
frozen
together
by
this
time
but
she
was
not
acquainted
with
lake
ice
it
might
be
treacherous
pooh
she
exclaimed
at
last
wind
still
onshore
i
try
it
stepping
out
upon
the
first
flat
cake
she
hurried
across
it
to
dodge
into
the
shadow
of
a
towering
pile
of
broken
fragments
catch
me
she
exclaimed
joyously
aloud
catch
me
if
you
can
she
had
reverted
to
the
days
of
her
childhood
and
was
playing
with
herself
first
behind
this
pile
then
that
she
flitted
in
the
moonlight
like
a
ghost
on
and
on
in
a
zigzag
course
she
went
until
a
glance
back
brought
from
her
lips
an
exclamation
of
surprise
how
far
i
am
from
the
shore
for
a
moment
she
stood
quite
still
then
the
startled
exclamation
came
again
that
cake
of
ice
tips
it
moves
i
must
go
back
springing
from
the
cake
she
leaped
upon
another
and
another
she
had
just
succeeded
in
reaching
a
spot
where
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
ice
in
response
to
the
swells
which
swept
in
from
the
lake
was
lessening
when
something
caused
her
heart
to
flutter
wildly
had
she
seen
a
dark
form
disappear
behind
that
off
to
her
right
in
an
instant
she
was
hugging
the
shadow
of
a
great
cake
no
she
had
not
been
mistaken
out
of
the
silence
there
came
the
of
footsteps
what
can
it
mean
she
whispered
locating
as
best
she
could
the
position
of
the
intruder
she
sprang
away
in
the
opposite
direction
she
was
engaged
in
a
game
of
not
with
herself
but
with
some
other
person
a
stranger
probably
what
the
outcome
of
that
game
would
be
she
could
not
tell
chapter
ix
someone
drops
in
from
nowhere
pausing
to
listen
whenever
she
gained
the
protecting
shadow
of
an
lucile
caught
each
time
the
of
footsteps
this
so
terrified
her
that
she
lost
all
knowledge
of
direction
her
only
thought
to
put
a
greater
distance
between
herself
and
that
haunting
black
shadow
suddenly
she
awoke
to
her
old
peril
the
ice
beneath
her
was
heaving
before
her
lay
a
dark
patch
of
water
in
her
excitement
she
had
been
making
her
way
toward
open
water
with
a
shudder
she
wheeled
about
and
forcing
her
mind
to
calmer
counsel
chose
a
circling
route
which
would
eventually
bring
her
to
the
shore
again
she
dodged
from
to
again
paused
to
hear
the
wild
beating
of
her
own
heart
and
the
of
the
shadow
footfalls
but
what
was
this
as
she
listened
she
seemed
to
catch
the
fall
of
two
pairs
of
feet
in
desperation
she
shot
forward
a
great
distance
without
pausing
when
at
last
she
did
pause
it
was
with
the
utmost
consternation
that
she
realized
that
not
one
or
two
but
many
pairs
of
feet
were
dropping
on
the
ice
floor
of
the
lake
as
she
dodged
out
for
another
flight
she
saw
them
three
of
them
as
they
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
one
to
the
right
one
to
the
left
one
behind
her
they
were
closing
in
upon
her
there
was
still
a
space
between
the
two
to
right
and
left
through
this
she
sprang
only
to
see
a
fourth
directly
before
her
as
she
again
dodged
into
a
sheltering
shadow
she
nerved
herself
for
a
scream
the
girls
were
away
but
someone
mark
pence
the
fishermen
old
timmie
might
hear
and
come
to
her
aid
but
what
was
this
she
no
longer
caught
the
shuffle
of
moving
feet
all
was
silent
as
the
tomb
for
a
moment
she
hovered
there
undecided
then
she
caught
the
distant
even
of
two
pairs
of
heavy
marching
feet
glancing
shoreward
she
saw
two
burly
policemen
their
brass
buttons
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
marching
down
the
beach
it
had
been
the
presence
of
these
officers
which
had
held
her
pursuers
to
their
shadowy
if
she
but
screamed
once
these
officers
would
come
to
her
rescue
but
she
had
from
early
childhood
experienced
a
great
fear
of
policemen
when
she
endeavored
to
scream
her
tongue
clung
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
so
there
she
stood
motionless
voiceless
until
the
officers
had
passed
from
her
sight
while
lucile
was
experiencing
the
strange
thrills
of
this
terrible
game
out
on
the
lake
ice
florence
and
marian
were
witnessing
mysterious
actions
of
strange
persons
out
on
the
lagoon
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
there
were
a
number
of
persons
skating
on
the
north
end
of
the
lagoon
so
the
two
girls
experienced
no
fear
as
they
went
for
a
dash
down
the
southern
channel
which
lay
between
an
island
and
the
shore
at
the
south
end
of
the
lagoon
the
channel
which
became
very
narrow
was
spanned
by
a
wooden
bridge
this
bridge
even
in
the
daytime
always
gave
marian
a
shock
of
something
very
like
fear
for
it
was
here
that
a
great
tragedy
ending
in
the
death
of
a
prominent
society
woman
had
occurred
now
as
she
found
herself
nearing
it
preparing
for
a
long
skimming
glide
beneath
it
she
felt
a
chill
shoot
up
her
spine
involuntarily
she
glanced
up
at
the
bridge
railing
then
she
gripped
florence
arm
tightly
who
can
that
be
on
the
bridge
at
this
hour
of
the
night
she
whispered
probably
someone
who
has
climbed
up
there
to
take
off
his
skates
said
florence
with
her
characteristic
coolness
but
look
he
waving
his
arms
he
signaling
do
you
suppose
he
means
it
for
us
no
said
florence
he
looking
north
toward
the
edge
of
the
island
come
on
pay
no
attention
to
him
under
we
go
with
a
great
broad
swinging
stroke
she
fairly
threw
her
lighter
partner
across
the
shadow
that
the
bridge
made
and
out
into
the
moonlight
on
the
other
side
marian
was
breathing
quite
easily
again
they
had
made
half
the
length
of
the
island
on
the
return
lap
when
she
again
gripped
florence
arm
a
sled
she
whispered
what
of
it
florence
tone
was
impatient
you
are
seeing
things
the
sled
drawn
by
two
men
without
skates
was
passing
diagonally
across
the
lagoon
it
was
seven
or
eight
feet
long
and
stood
a
full
three
feet
above
the
ice
the
runners
of
solid
boards
were
exceedingly
broad
what
a
strange
sled
said
marian
as
they
cut
across
the
path
of
the
two
men
sled
seems
heavy
remarked
florence
at
least
one
would
think
it
was
by
the
way
they
slip
and
slide
as
they
pull
it
they
had
passed
a
hundred
yards
beyond
that
spot
when
florence
turned
to
glance
back
why
look
she
exclaimed
there
a
man
sitting
on
the
ice
back
there
a
hundred
yards
or
so
one
of
the
men
with
the
sled
no
there
they
go
some
skater
tightening
his
strap
was
one
in
sight
a
moment
ago
tell
you
what
florence
exclaimed
let
circle
back
marian
was
not
keen
for
this
adventure
but
accompanied
her
companion
without
comment
nothing
really
came
of
it
not
at
that
time
the
man
sat
all
humped
over
on
the
ice
as
if
mending
a
broken
skate
he
did
not
move
nor
look
up
florence
thought
she
saw
beside
him
a
somewhat
bulky
package
but
could
not
quite
tell
his
coat
almost
concealed
it
if
indeed
there
was
a
package
two
men
drawing
a
strange
sled
she
mused
one
man
on
the
ice
alone
possibly
a
package
turning
to
marian
she
asked
what
do
you
make
of
it
why
nothing
said
marian
in
surprise
why
should
i
well
perhaps
you
should
said
florence
thoughtfully
there
was
something
to
it
after
all
and
what
this
something
was
they
were
destined
to
learn
in
the
days
that
were
to
follow
out
among
the
between
the
breakwaters
cowering
in
the
shadows
too
frightened
to
scream
lucile
was
seeing
things
hardly
had
the
policemen
disappeared
behind
the
boats
on
the
dry
dock
than
the
dark
figures
began
to
reappear
and
so
many
of
them
she
breathed
she
was
tempted
to
believe
she
was
in
a
trance
to
the
right
of
her
to
the
left
before
behind
she
saw
them
ten
twenty
thirty
perhaps
forty
darkly
enshrouded
heads
peered
out
from
the
shadows
as
if
in
a
fairy
book
she
thrilled
what
can
it
mean
what
are
all
these
people
doing
out
here
at
this
ghostly
hour
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
calm
desperate
courage
gliding
from
her
shadow
she
walked
boldly
out
into
the
moonlight
her
heart
was
racing
madly
her
knees
trembled
she
could
scarcely
walk
yet
walk
she
did
with
a
steady
determined
tread
past
this
round
this
row
of
cakes
across
this
broad
open
spot
she
moved
no
one
sprang
out
to
intercept
her
progress
here
and
there
a
dark
head
appeared
for
an
instant
only
immediately
to
disappear
cowards
she
told
herself
all
cowards
afraid
now
she
was
approaching
the
sandy
beach
unable
longer
to
restrain
her
impulses
she
broke
into
a
wild
run
she
arrived
at
the
side
of
the
o
moo
entirely
out
of
breath
leaning
against
its
side
for
a
moment
she
turned
to
look
back
there
was
not
a
person
in
sight
the
beach
the
ice
the
black
lines
of
breakwaters
seemed
as
silent
and
forsaken
as
the
heart
of
a
desert
and
yet
it
is
swarming
with
men
she
breathed
i
wonder
what
they
wanted
suddenly
she
started
a
figure
had
come
into
sight
round
the
nearest
prow
for
an
instant
her
hand
gripped
a
round
of
the
ladder
a
preparatory
move
for
upward
flight
then
her
hand
relaxed
oh
she
breathed
it
you
yes
it
is
i
mark
pence
said
a
friendly
boyish
voice
i
i
suppose
i
should
be
afraid
of
you
said
lucile
but
i
not
why
why
should
you
he
asked
with
a
smile
well
you
see
everyone
about
this
old
dry
dock
is
so
terribly
mysterious
i
just
had
an
awful
fright
tell
me
about
it
mark
pence
smiled
as
he
spoke
seating
herself
upon
the
flukes
of
an
anchor
she
did
tell
him
told
him
not
alone
of
her
experience
that
night
but
of
the
one
of
that
other
night
in
the
spanish
mission
do
you
know
he
said
soberly
when
she
had
finished
there
a
lot
of
mysterious
things
happening
about
this
dock
i
do
think
it
will
last
much
longer
though
things
are
sort
of
coming
to
a
head
know
what
those
two
policemen
were
here
for
lucile
shook
her
head
made
a
call
on
the
chinks
down
there
in
the
old
scow
came
to
look
for
something
but
they
did
find
it
heard
them
say
as
much
when
they
came
out
they
were
mighty
excited
about
something
though
bet
they
thought
it
was
mighty
strange
that
there
was
a
stairway
in
that
old
scow
twenty
feet
deep
are
are
you
sure
about
that
stairway
the
boy
reply
was
confident
sure
i
am
that
i
standing
here
lucile
protested
but
most
folks
do
use
circling
stairways
much
they
do
know
i
do
though
i
work
in
a
library
there
are
scores
of
circling
stairways
among
the
stacks
and
i
know
just
how
high
each
one
is
it
queer
about
that
stairway
lucile
breathed
i
must
be
going
up
i
getting
chill
sitting
here
well
mark
pence
put
out
his
hand
and
seized
hers
in
a
friendly
grip
just
remember
i
with
you
if
you
ever
need
me
just
whistle
and
i
come
running
thanks
thanks
aw
awfully
said
lucile
a
strange
catch
in
her
throat
her
eyes
followed
him
until
the
boat
prow
had
hidden
him
then
she
hurried
up
the
and
into
the
cabin
she
was
shivering
all
over
whether
from
a
chill
or
from
nervous
excitement
she
could
not
tell
the
other
girls
came
in
a
few
moments
later
for
an
hour
they
sat
in
a
corner
drinking
hot
chocolate
and
telling
of
their
night
adventures
then
they
prepared
themselves
for
the
night
rest
for
a
long
time
after
the
others
had
retired
florence
sat
in
a
huge
upholstered
chair
lights
out
staring
into
the
dark
she
was
thinking
over
the
experiences
of
the
past
few
weeks
trying
to
put
them
together
in
a
geometric
whole
just
as
an
artist
arranges
the
parts
of
a
stained
glass
window
there
lucile
experience
in
the
old
spanish
mission
she
mused
and
my
own
in
the
museum
then
there
mark
pence
visit
to
the
old
scow
and
the
circular
stairway
then
there
the
blue
candlestick
it
rare
mysterious
and
valuable
why
the
police
are
interested
in
it
why
then
there
the
visit
and
lucile
experience
on
the
ice
and
the
two
policemen
visiting
the
old
scow
and
there
that
man
on
the
bridge
the
two
with
the
sled
and
the
one
sitting
on
the
ice
it
all
mysterious
so
it
ought
all
to
fit
together
somehow
for
a
long
time
she
sat
wrapped
in
deep
thought
then
she
started
suddenly
blue
she
whispered
the
face
lucile
saw
in
the
mission
was
blue
illuminated
and
blue
in
the
story
the
old
seaman
told
me
the
face
of
the
god
of
the
negontisks
was
illuminated
and
blue
the
candlestick
i
found
was
blue
what
should
be
more
natural
than
that
a
blue
jade
candlestick
should
be
made
in
which
to
set
a
candle
with
which
to
illumine
the
blue
god
blue
jade
is
valuable
a
ring
or
stickpin
set
with
a
small
piece
of
it
is
costly
that
makes
the
candlestick
both
costly
and
valuable
all
that
she
sighed
seems
to
hang
together
again
she
sat
for
a
time
in
deep
thought
only
she
breathed
at
last
who
ever
heard
of
a
tribe
of
negontisks
in
america
let
alone
here
in
chicago
try
to
imagine
a
hundred
or
more
with
no
money
and
no
means
of
transportation
but
their
native
traveling
eight
thousand
miles
over
land
and
sea
and
ending
up
in
chicago
it
ca
be
imagined
it
simply
is
done
so
there
goes
my
carefully
arranged
puzzle
all
to
smash
throwing
off
her
she
climbed
into
her
berth
listening
to
the
lashing
the
mast
for
an
instant
then
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
x
the
real
cruise
begins
next
morning
florence
was
skating
down
the
lagoon
deep
in
thoughts
of
the
mysterious
events
of
the
past
few
days
so
deeply
engrossing
were
these
thoughts
that
she
did
not
see
what
lay
before
her
suddenly
her
skate
struck
some
solid
obstacle
she
tripped
then
went
sprawling
her
loosened
skate
shot
off
in
another
direction
that
queer
she
murmured
as
she
sat
up
rubbing
her
knees
glancing
back
over
the
way
she
had
come
she
saw
nothing
more
than
a
circular
raised
spot
which
had
formed
when
water
had
sprung
up
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
that
strange
she
mused
and
rising
she
hopped
and
glided
back
to
the
spot
someone
must
have
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
she
reflected
though
what
they
do
it
for
is
more
than
i
can
see
we
youngsters
used
to
do
that
to
get
a
drink
when
we
were
skating
on
a
little
prairie
pond
a
long
way
from
nowhere
but
here
the
ice
is
fourteen
inches
thick
and
there
a
drink
of
water
to
be
had
for
the
asking
up
at
the
skate
house
as
she
glanced
down
at
the
spot
another
strange
circumstance
surprised
her
what
makes
that
spot
look
so
much
bluer
than
the
other
ice
she
asked
herself
as
she
examined
it
more
closely
she
saw
that
this
patch
of
blue
had
a
very
definite
outline
but
rough
and
jagged
like
the
edges
of
a
piece
of
cloth
haggled
by
a
child
who
is
just
learning
to
use
a
pair
of
scissors
having
recaptured
her
fugitive
skate
she
clamped
it
to
her
foot
and
was
about
to
go
on
her
way
when
another
startling
fact
arrested
her
why
that
she
thought
is
just
about
where
that
man
was
sitting
last
night
the
one
marian
and
i
saw
who
had
apparently
dropped
in
from
nowhere
so
struck
with
the
discovery
was
she
that
she
skated
over
to
the
edge
of
the
ice
where
the
sled
drawn
by
the
two
strangers
had
left
the
snow
there
she
took
good
notice
of
the
direction
in
which
the
sled
had
been
going
when
it
came
upon
the
ice
turning
about
she
skated
backward
with
her
eyes
on
the
track
made
by
the
sled
runners
she
was
endeavoring
to
retrace
the
sled
over
the
ice
where
no
tracks
were
visible
in
an
effort
to
prove
that
the
sled
had
arrived
at
the
point
on
the
ice
where
the
hole
had
been
cut
when
it
turned
and
struck
off
at
another
angle
so
successful
was
she
in
this
that
she
all
but
fell
over
the
rise
in
the
ice
a
second
time
that
that
she
murmured
now
for
something
else
skating
rapidly
to
the
end
of
the
lagoon
nearest
the
dry
dock
she
circulated
about
until
she
discovered
the
spot
at
which
the
sled
had
left
the
ice
again
guiding
herself
by
the
course
taken
by
the
sled
she
skated
backward
and
in
a
short
time
found
herself
once
more
beside
the
spot
in
the
ice
where
the
hole
had
been
cut
that
proves
something
she
told
herself
but
just
how
much
i
tell
but
i
leave
that
to
study
out
must
hurry
on
or
i
be
late
to
my
lecture
that
sled
track
went
toward
the
dry
dock
she
told
herself
a
few
moments
later
when
i
go
home
i
try
to
trace
it
out
and
see
where
it
went
lucile
was
home
early
that
day
marian
had
not
gone
to
school
at
all
she
had
stayed
on
the
beach
making
sketches
of
the
on
the
lake
front
i
be
going
out
again
she
told
lucile
wind
shifted
it
offshore
now
and
rising
there
are
certain
effects
of
lights
and
shadows
which
you
get
on
the
rim
of
a
body
of
fresh
water
which
you
in
the
sea
ice
sea
ice
is
white
dull
white
like
snow
fresh
water
ice
is
blue
blue
as
the
sky
sometimes
i
want
to
catch
it
before
it
blows
out
again
but
what
brings
you
home
so
early
lucile
cut
my
lecture
headache
she
explained
pressing
her
temples
nothing
much
though
and
marian
she
exclaimed
suddenly
what
do
you
think
that
story
did
he
take
it
the
editor
of
the
literary
monthly
no
better
than
that
could
anything
be
better
than
that
lots
of
things
what
better
listen
declaimed
lucile
striking
a
mock
dramatic
attitude
he
said
the
literary
editor
did
that
it
was
too
good
for
his
little
fancy
poor
little
publication
my
story
too
good
my
story
a
freshman
story
she
burst
into
sudden
laughter
but
stopped
abruptly
and
sat
down
pressing
her
temples
and
groaning
my
poor
head
you
never
can
tell
about
it
about
stories
said
marian
heads
either
you
have
to
go
to
bed
early
and
get
a
good
night
sleep
there
been
entirely
too
much
excitement
on
board
these
last
few
nights
he
said
lucile
went
on
that
the
literary
monthly
did
pay
for
stories
of
course
i
knew
that
and
he
said
that
he
thought
i
could
sell
my
story
that
he
thought
it
was
good
enough
for
that
the
technique
was
not
quite
perfect
there
was
too
much
explanation
at
the
beginning
and
the
climax
was
short
but
the
theme
and
plot
were
unusual
he
thought
that
would
put
it
over
he
knew
exactly
the
place
to
send
it
tales
a
new
magazine
just
started
by
a
very
successful
editor
he
knows
him
personally
he
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
him
and
i
mailed
the
story
to
him
right
away
so
you
see
she
smiled
folding
her
arms
i
am
to
be
an
authoress
a
a
second
george
eliot
if
you
please
but
seaside
tales
is
published
right
down
town
why
did
you
mail
it
do
you
think
said
lucile
in
real
consternation
that
i
would
dare
beard
that
lion
of
an
editor
in
his
den
the
editor
of
a
real
magazine
that
pays
genuine
money
for
stories
why
i
i
die
of
fright
besides
one
does
not
do
it
really
one
does
what
was
your
story
about
asked
marian
suddenly
why
i
i
was
going
to
tell
but
i
guess
i
will
it
was
about
three
girls
living
on
a
yacht
in
a
dry
dock
and
one
night
in
a
storm
the
yacht
broke
loose
on
the
dry
dock
and
went
out
into
the
water
then
it
drifted
out
to
sea
then
of
course
they
had
to
get
back
to
land
that
dramatic
yes
very
smiled
marian
goodness
i
hope
it
never
happens
to
the
o
moo
just
think
not
one
of
us
even
knows
how
to
start
the
engine
i
mean
to
have
holmes
show
me
the
very
next
time
he
and
holmes
come
down
he
think
you
crazy
maybe
he
will
but
you
never
can
tell
that
was
one
time
when
lucile
was
right
in
this
queer
old
world
you
never
can
tell
when
florence
returned
from
the
university
the
shades
of
night
were
already
falling
there
was
however
sufficient
light
to
enable
her
to
follow
the
track
of
the
sled
she
had
seen
the
night
before
this
track
led
straight
across
the
park
to
the
beach
then
along
the
beach
in
the
direction
of
the
dry
dock
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
dry
dock
it
turned
suddenly
to
the
left
and
was
at
once
lost
among
the
tumbled
masses
of
ice
where
no
trace
of
it
could
be
found
sled
might
be
hidden
out
there
she
mused
for
a
time
she
contemplated
going
out
in
search
of
it
when
however
she
realized
that
it
was
growing
quite
dark
and
recalled
lucile
unpleasant
experience
of
the
night
before
she
decided
not
to
venture
if
they
come
back
to
the
beach
again
she
told
herself
i
can
pick
up
their
tracks
in
the
snow
farther
down
walking
briskly
she
covered
the
remaining
distance
to
the
spot
on
the
beach
opposite
the
o
moo
not
yet
she
whispered
and
climbing
over
the
trestle
she
made
her
way
on
down
the
beach
her
eyes
were
always
on
the
ground
now
she
climbed
a
trestle
now
walked
round
an
anchor
frozen
into
the
sand
but
always
her
eyes
returned
to
the
tracks
in
the
snow
tracks
enough
there
were
footprints
of
men
but
never
a
trace
of
a
sled
leaving
the
ice
she
had
gone
a
considerable
distance
when
she
became
conscious
of
some
person
not
far
away
on
looking
up
she
was
startled
to
note
that
she
had
reached
a
point
opposite
the
great
black
scow
where
the
orientals
lived
at
the
end
of
the
scow
stood
a
man
his
face
disfigured
by
a
scowl
he
stood
watching
her
he
was
dressed
in
the
black
gownlike
garb
of
the
chinese
he
wore
a
queue
there
was
however
something
strange
about
his
face
she
fancied
she
had
seen
him
somewhere
before
but
where
she
could
not
tell
then
the
man
moved
out
of
the
light
that
shone
on
him
from
a
window
and
was
swallowed
up
by
the
shadows
no
use
going
farther
she
told
herself
if
the
sled
belongs
on
the
dry
dock
somewhere
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
two
persons
to
lift
it
on
their
shoulders
and
carry
it
in
from
the
ice
that
would
throw
one
completely
off
the
trail
turning
she
retraced
her
steps
along
the
beach
to
the
trestle
work
on
which
the
o
moo
rested
then
swinging
about
to
the
right
she
made
her
way
to
the
yacht
side
once
on
deck
she
made
certain
that
the
other
girls
were
aboard
then
retraced
her
steps
to
the
deck
side
where
she
pulled
down
the
canvas
and
tied
it
securely
for
a
moment
she
stood
listening
to
the
lash
of
ropes
on
the
mast
the
canvas
covering
bulged
and
sagged
cool
air
fanned
her
cheeks
going
to
be
a
bad
storm
she
told
herself
offshore
wind
too
all
the
ice
will
go
out
and
everything
with
it
that
is
tied
down
when
all
was
tight
on
deck
she
slipped
into
the
cabin
lucile
who
ate
very
little
dinner
that
night
retired
early
marian
studied
until
the
clock
pointed
at
eleven
when
florence
with
a
sigh
of
regret
put
down
her
psychology
to
prepare
for
sleep
whew
she
breathed
what
a
storm
listen
to
the
canvas
boom
like
a
schooner
at
sea
hope
it
does
tear
the
canvas
away
hope
it
does
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
the
thought
which
had
come
to
her
was
too
absurd
once
snugly
tucked
in
her
bed
she
found
her
mind
returning
to
the
morning
discovery
what
did
that
new
ice
on
the
lagoon
mean
why
had
the
hole
been
cut
why
was
the
ice
blue
did
the
sled
and
the
man
sitting
on
the
ice
the
night
before
have
anything
to
do
with
it
did
the
man
cut
that
hole
if
so
why
he
might
she
told
herself
have
had
something
to
conceal
some
valuables
stolen
diamonds
or
gold
but
how
could
he
hope
to
recover
it
if
he
dropped
it
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
the
water
beneath
the
ice
was
always
murky
and
there
was
a
strong
current
there
anything
dropped
beneath
that
ice
would
be
lost
forever
she
remembered
the
two
policemen
whom
lucile
had
seen
on
the
beach
that
same
night
perhaps
those
two
men
had
been
running
from
the
officers
trying
to
conceal
something
but
how
had
the
man
come
there
on
the
ice
perhaps
she
started
at
the
thought
perhaps
this
man
rode
there
beneath
the
sled
the
runners
had
been
extraordinarily
broad
a
man
could
easily
ride
between
them
the
thought
gave
her
a
start
she
thought
of
lucile
experience
in
the
old
mission
and
of
her
own
with
the
blue
candlestick
perhaps
she
told
herself
they
dropped
the
blue
god
through
the
ice
then
she
smiled
at
herself
how
could
the
blue
god
be
in
chicago
if
it
were
they
would
never
drop
it
in
the
water
beneath
the
ice
where
it
could
never
be
recovered
yet
why
had
the
ice
been
blue
why
she
fell
asleep
to
listen
in
her
dreams
to
the
lash
of
ropes
the
boom
of
canvas
and
to
dream
of
riding
a
frail
craft
on
a
sea
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
just
why
it
is
that
one
knows
how
long
he
has
slept
yet
we
very
often
do
know
one
wakens
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
before
the
clock
strikes
the
hour
he
says
to
himself
i
have
slept
three
hours
and
he
is
right
when
florence
awoke
that
night
she
knew
she
had
been
asleep
for
about
five
hours
it
was
dark
pitch
dark
in
the
cabin
the
storm
was
still
raging
just
listen
she
murmured
dreamily
one
could
easily
imagine
that
we
were
out
to
sea
there
was
a
tremendous
booming
of
canvas
and
a
lashing
sound
which
resembled
the
wash
of
the
waves
but
this
last
she
told
herself
was
the
ropes
beating
the
mast
she
had
dozed
off
again
when
some
strange
element
of
the
storm
brought
her
once
more
half
awake
one
would
almost
say
the
yacht
was
pitching
she
thought
as
in
a
dream
but
she
firmly
fastened
it
is
impossible
she
suddenly
she
sat
up
fully
awake
she
had
moved
a
trifle
closer
to
the
porthole
her
head
had
been
banged
against
it
it
pitching
she
exclaimed
in
an
awed
whisper
her
mind
whirled
what
had
happened
was
the
storm
so
violent
that
the
o
moo
was
being
rocked
from
side
to
side
on
her
trestle
would
she
soon
topple
over
to
go
crashing
on
the
frozen
sand
or
had
they
in
some
way
been
blown
out
to
sea
this
last
seemed
impossible
she
thought
of
the
block
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
car
on
which
the
o
moo
stood
then
of
the
strong
cable
fastened
to
her
prow
it
impossible
she
muttered
there
was
one
way
to
prove
this
she
proceeded
to
apply
the
test
turning
a
screw
which
held
her
porthole
closed
she
swung
the
metal
framed
glass
wide
open
instantly
she
slammed
it
shut
she
had
been
soaked
with
a
perfect
deluge
of
water
her
heart
stopped
beating
she
tried
to
shout
to
the
other
girls
but
her
tongue
clung
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
concerning
the
nature
of
the
catastrophe
which
had
come
over
them
how
it
had
happened
she
could
not
even
guess
this
much
she
knew
were
girls
girls
her
own
voice
shouted
to
her
like
that
of
a
ghost
marian
lucile
wake
up
we
afloat
the
o
moo
adrift
marian
groaned
sat
up
quickly
then
as
quickly
fell
back
again
her
head
had
collided
with
a
beam
what
what
the
matter
she
stammered
there
came
a
low
moan
from
lucile
i
so
sick
seasick
poor
child
said
florence
no
no
not
that
lucile
voice
was
faint
it
my
head
splitting
i
ca
raise
it
i
i
afraid
it
going
to
be
be
bad
florence
leaped
to
the
floor
her
feet
splashed
into
a
thin
sheet
of
water
which
washed
about
on
the
carpet
the
cold
chill
of
it
brought
her
to
her
senses
they
were
afloat
someone
had
cast
them
adrift
was
that
someone
on
deck
at
this
moment
or
had
he
merely
cut
the
cable
removed
the
blocks
and
allowed
the
wind
to
do
the
rest
this
must
be
determined
at
once
hastily
dragging
some
rubbers
on
her
benumbed
feet
she
splashed
her
way
to
the
door
having
made
sure
that
this
was
securely
locked
she
went
to
each
window
and
porthole
fastening
each
as
securely
as
possible
this
done
she
fought
her
way
to
lucile
berth
and
steadying
herself
with
one
hand
placed
the
other
on
lucile
brow
an
exclamation
escaped
her
lips
the
forehead
was
burning
hot
lucile
had
a
raging
fever
if
i
had
the
coward
who
cut
us
loose
she
cried
through
clenched
teeth
i
i
kill
him
chapter
xi
a
mysterious
adventure
there
are
people
who
can
not
sleep
during
a
storm
it
sets
their
nerves
sets
wild
racing
thoughts
crowding
through
their
minds
and
leaves
them
sleeplessly
alert
it
is
as
if
a
thousand
wild
witches
rode
on
every
mad
rush
of
the
wind
their
shrill
voices
screaming
in
each
blast
their
fingers
rattling
at
every
windowpane
and
their
breath
puffing
at
the
flickering
light
mark
pence
could
not
sleep
during
that
storm
rocking
every
schooner
yacht
and
yawl
on
its
cradle
of
trestlework
it
went
racing
out
over
the
lake
carrying
every
movable
object
with
it
after
many
vain
attempts
to
close
his
eyes
he
at
last
rose
and
drawing
on
his
clothes
said
to
himself
i
go
out
and
fight
with
it
for
a
time
after
that
i
may
be
able
to
sleep
whew
what
a
whooper
he
exclaimed
as
the
wind
slamming
the
door
after
him
blew
him
to
the
beach
grappling
with
the
wind
as
one
grapples
a
wrestling
mate
he
stooped
low
then
shot
forward
like
springing
against
a
net
he
shrieked
the
words
in
wild
defiance
of
the
wind
then
steadily
step
by
step
he
fought
his
way
toward
the
nearest
schooner
having
gained
the
lee
of
it
he
paused
a
moment
for
breath
the
storm
came
in
gusts
now
in
a
blinding
fury
of
snow
it
blotted
out
everything
about
him
now
there
was
a
lull
the
wind
appeared
to
pause
to
regain
its
breath
at
such
times
as
this
his
eyes
penetrated
the
space
before
him
do
look
quite
right
over
there
he
grumbled
something
the
matter
with
the
sky
line
not
enough
boats
one
would
say
he
had
regained
his
breath
for
a
moment
he
debated
the
advisability
of
venturing
further
into
the
storm
finally
he
buttoned
his
coat
collar
tighter
as
he
muttered
go
over
and
see
as
he
moved
from
his
position
of
safety
there
came
another
gust
more
furious
than
any
that
had
gone
before
it
threatened
to
lift
him
from
the
earth
and
hurl
him
into
the
lake
but
stooping
low
all
but
crawling
he
made
headway
and
just
as
the
lull
came
gripped
the
top
rail
of
the
trestle
on
which
the
o
moo
had
rested
hardly
had
he
seized
it
than
his
hand
slipped
and
he
went
sprawling
that
strange
he
muttered
awful
slippery
removing
one
glove
he
felt
of
the
other
grease
he
muttered
in
blank
astonishment
somebody
greased
that
track
then
with
the
suspicion
of
treachery
dawning
upon
him
he
glanced
up
at
the
spot
where
the
o
moo
should
have
been
gone
he
exclaimed
the
o
moo
gone
and
six
hours
ago
she
was
here
i
swear
it
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
light
in
the
window
girls
there
now
she
gone
and
the
girls
with
her
gone
in
such
a
storm
what
madness
again
he
thought
of
the
greased
track
no
no
what
treachery
from
his
pocket
he
drew
a
flashlight
he
meant
to
examine
that
track
it
had
been
heavily
greased
all
the
way
down
to
the
water
that
the
iron
wheels
of
the
car
on
which
the
o
moo
had
rested
had
passed
down
the
track
there
could
be
no
doubt
mingled
with
the
grease
there
was
much
iron
rust
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
used
envelope
he
scraped
a
quantity
of
the
grease
into
it
then
replaced
the
envelope
evidence
he
said
grimly
might
not
be
worth
much
might
mean
a
lot
the
wind
was
roaring
again
clinging
to
the
trestle
he
waited
its
passing
gone
he
exclaimed
gone
out
to
sea
it
those
chinks
what
beasts
i
get
them
go
after
them
in
just
another
minute
then
i
make
them
help
me
launch
my
schooner
to
go
in
search
of
that
o
moo
three
girls
not
one
of
them
knows
how
to
start
the
engine
girl
called
marian
told
me
so
and
in
such
a
storm
got
to
make
sure
though
got
to
get
all
the
evidence
i
can
again
he
fought
his
way
against
the
wind
until
he
came
to
the
point
where
the
heavy
blocks
had
held
in
place
the
wheels
of
the
truck
beneath
the
o
moo
these
had
been
fastened
by
strong
cleats
hard
silent
work
had
been
required
to
loosen
them
throwing
the
light
upon
the
blocks
he
examined
them
carefully
on
the
side
of
one
he
discovered
a
peculiar
mark
the
wood
flattened
out
under
pressure
for
a
space
of
some
four
square
inches
was
raised
in
the
very
center
in
two
narrow
lines
each
an
inch
long
these
lines
crossed
one
another
take
it
home
more
evidence
perhaps
having
fought
his
way
up
to
the
place
where
the
cable
had
been
fastened
he
examined
the
loosened
end
without
discovering
anything
peculiar
about
it
that
all
i
can
do
here
he
decided
now
for
the
rescue
got
to
have
help
old
timmie
not
much
good
too
old
fishermen
all
gone
up
the
coast
to
fish
through
the
ice
chinks
all
there
are
left
make
help
undo
what
they
done
if
they
wo
come
i
fetch
during
a
lull
in
the
storm
he
returned
to
his
schooner
there
he
deposited
the
evidence
then
throwing
a
small
case
over
his
shoulder
and
thrusting
a
bottle
into
his
pocket
he
again
ventured
out
into
the
storm
this
time
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
scow
inhabited
by
the
orientals
hardly
had
florence
standing
by
the
side
of
lucile
berth
hurled
out
her
fiery
denunciation
of
the
wretch
who
had
cast
their
yacht
afloat
than
the
o
moo
gave
a
sudden
lurch
which
threw
her
to
the
floor
pandemonium
broke
loose
there
came
a
crash
of
glass
from
the
laboratory
out
of
the
darkness
a
bulk
loomed
at
her
as
she
attempted
to
rise
the
thing
appearing
to
spring
at
her
knocked
her
down
then
some
other
thing
buried
her
deep
the
thing
that
had
struck
her
was
a
heavy
chair
she
was
buried
beneath
the
blanket
and
mattress
from
her
own
berth
as
she
attempted
to
extricate
herself
it
seemed
that
the
entire
contents
of
the
cabin
played
leapfrog
over
her
head
careening
like
a
deserted
airship
the
o
moo
appeared
to
plunge
prow
first
down
an
endless
abyss
only
to
climb
laboriously
up
on
the
other
side
this
did
not
last
for
long
there
was
no
engine
going
no
driving
power
suddenly
she
slipped
into
the
trough
of
a
huge
wave
and
wallowed
there
helplessly
while
tons
of
rushing
water
swept
across
her
deck
the
engine
gasped
florence
it
should
be
started
struggling
to
free
herself
she
thought
of
lucile
may
have
been
thrown
from
her
berth
she
groaned
groping
about
she
found
lucile
berth
clung
there
while
the
yacht
gave
a
wild
circling
lurch
then
felt
for
her
sick
companion
clinging
to
the
rail
of
her
berth
lucile
lay
there
silently
sobbing
securing
two
blankets
florence
twisted
them
into
ropes
then
bound
them
across
lucile
one
at
her
knees
the
other
at
her
chest
that
hold
you
she
whispered
hoarsely
starting
across
the
cabin
to
the
electric
switch
she
was
caught
again
and
thrown
off
her
feet
she
collided
with
something
that
something
put
out
two
arms
which
encircled
her
the
two
of
them
fell
to
the
floor
then
rolled
half
the
length
of
it
having
regained
her
breath
florence
put
out
a
hand
she
touched
a
garment
she
knew
by
the
feel
of
it
that
it
was
marian
thank
goodness
she
said
you
still
here
and
alive
in
the
midst
of
all
this
catastrophe
marian
began
to
giggle
it
too
absurd
she
exploded
i
traveled
on
the
arctic
and
pacific
real
oceans
and
come
here
and
have
a
mere
lake
kick
up
such
a
rumpus
but
marian
florence
expostulated
it
serious
these
winter
lake
storms
are
terrible
the
ship
may
go
to
the
bottom
any
moment
it
built
for
this
and
there
may
be
ice
too
one
crack
from
ice
and
burst
like
an
eggshell
we
got
to
get
lights
got
ta
start
the
engine
dragging
marian
to
her
feet
she
made
her
way
along
the
wall
to
the
light
switch
there
came
a
sudden
flood
of
light
which
brought
out
in
bold
relief
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
storm
tables
chairs
lounge
writing
paper
notebooks
shoes
garments
of
all
sorts
were
piled
in
a
heap
forward
the
heavy
carpet
was
soggy
with
water
one
glance
revealed
that
the
next
instant
the
lights
flickered
and
went
out
have
to
find
a
candle
said
florence
soberly
water
on
the
battery
wires
caused
a
short
circuit
we
ca
hope
to
use
electricity
ought
to
get
engine
started
some
way
got
to
get
a
candle
you
just
watch
out
screamed
marian
as
she
leaped
toward
a
berth
the
o
moo
had
suddenly
shot
her
prow
high
in
air
the
entire
contents
of
the
cabin
came
avalanching
down
upon
them
having
made
his
way
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
to
the
door
of
the
scow
on
the
dry
dock
occupied
by
the
orientals
mark
pence
paused
to
arrange
the
cloth
strap
carefully
over
his
shoulder
and
to
feel
in
his
pocket
then
he
beat
loudly
upon
the
door
as
he
had
expected
he
received
no
answer
without
further
formalities
he
put
his
knees
to
the
door
and
gave
it
a
shove
the
flimsy
lock
broke
so
suddenly
that
he
was
thrown
forward
losing
his
balance
he
plunged
headforemost
down
a
short
flight
of
stairs
with
a
low
whispered
exclamation
he
sprang
to
his
feet
putting
his
ear
to
the
wall
he
listened
there
were
sounds
low
grunts
slight
shuffling
of
feet
it
was
uncanny
a
cold
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
brow
danger
here
he
whispered
as
he
once
more
adjusted
the
cloth
strap
the
corridor
in
which
he
was
standing
was
dark
but
a
stream
of
blue
light
poured
out
from
beneath
a
door
to
his
right
hey
you
come
out
of
there
he
shouted
instantly
bedlam
followed
doors
were
flung
open
a
glaring
blue
light
flooded
all
o
o
came
from
every
side
a
knife
flashed
before
him
springing
back
he
tripped
over
something
then
suddenly
plunged
downward
he
had
fallen
down
the
circular
stairway
after
a
wild
dizzy
whirl
he
reached
bottom
with
a
bump
immediately
he
was
on
his
feet
his
hand
gripped
the
bottle
it
was
dark
down
here
dark
as
a
dungeon
got
to
get
out
of
here
he
whispered
whew
what
a
lot
of
them
twenty
or
thirty
no
use
hoping
for
help
from
them
fool
for
thinking
i
could
got
to
get
out
and
find
help
somewhere

and
get
out
quick
be
coming
down
drawing
something
from
the
case
slung
across
his
shoulder
he
pulled
it
down
over
his
face
it
was
a
gas
mask
his
old
war
mask
recharged
gripping
the
bottle
in
his
pocket
a
bottle
of
lucile
quick
action
gas
he
began
to
climb
the
stairs
he
had
made
of
the
distance
when
sensing
someone
close
to
him
he
threw
his
flashlight
open
right
before
him
grinning
fiendishly
a
knife
between
his
teeth
was
a
giant
oriental
mark
did
not
wait
for
the
attack
he
knew
was
coming
he
drew
back
his
arm
when
it
swung
forward
his
hand
held
the
bottle
of
gas
he
sent
it
crashing
against
the
iron
post
the
oriental
sprang
back
up
the
stairs
following
him
closely
mark
made
a
dash
for
the
door
all
about
him
sounded
wild
exclamations
gas
getting
in
its
work
he
muttered
darting
among
the
writhing
bodies
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
short
stairs
which
led
to
the
outer
door
now
his
hand
was
on
the
knob
and
now
the
door
flew
open
he
was
free
but
what
was
this
just
as
he
made
a
dash
for
it
the
gruff
voice
of
someone
very
near
him
shouted
here
they
come
nail
there
the
first
one
got
a
mask
on
get
him
that
was
all
he
heard
for
a
stunning
blow
crashed
on
his
head
he
staggered
fell
then
all
was
dark
chapter
xii
the
o
moo
rides
the
storm
florence
and
marian
lay
clinging
to
the
bare
springs
of
a
berth
they
had
made
that
point
of
safety
before
the
avalanche
of
furniture
books
and
had
reached
their
end
of
the
cabin
they
were
enduring
discomforts
beyond
description
the
yacht
was
now
pitching
from
side
to
side
in
an
alarming
fashion
the
wires
of
the
spring
on
which
they
rested
cut
their
tender
flesh
their
scant
clothing
was
saturated
with
cold
water
the
cabin
had
grown
cold
since
the
burning
of
the
electric
fuses
there
was
no
heat
they
were
chilled
to
the
bone
yet
they
dared
not
move
the
heavy
furniture
pitching
about
as
it
did
was
a
deadly
menace
here
above
it
all
they
were
safe
as
florence
lay
there
benumbed
with
cold
suffering
agonies
of
suspense
listening
to
the
thud
and
smash
of
furniture
the
rush
and
crush
of
waves
that
washed
the
deck
awaiting
the
crash
which
was
to
be
the
final
one
only
one
question
occupied
her
mind
how
and
when
would
the
final
moment
come
she
dared
not
hope
that
the
o
moo
would
ride
such
a
storm
safely
would
the
o
moo
she
asked
herself
turn
turtle
in
the
trough
of
a
wave
and
floating
mast
down
would
she
hold
them
there
to
drown
like
rats
in
a
cage
or
would
some
giant
wave
stave
her
in
to
sink
to
the
bottom
like
a
log
an
answer
was
postponed
the
o
moo
rode
bravely
on
they
were
in
the
worst
of
it
she
was
sure
of
that
ought
to
get
the
engine
started
she
told
herself
then
we
could
cut
the
waves
ride
them
not
wallow
along
in
a
trough
she
half
rose
to
attempt
to
reach
the
engine
room
no
use
she
groaned
no
light
if
we
fool
around
with
gasoline
and
a
candle
we
blow
the
whole
thing
up
but
even
as
she
thought
this
she
became
conscious
of
a
dim
light
what
could
it
be
she
sat
up
quickly
then
she
uttered
a
hoarse
laugh
first
gray
streak
of
dawn
she
muttered
then
she
thought
of
lucile
stay
where
you
are
she
said
to
marian
i
going
to
try
to
get
to
lucile
by
the
aid
of
the
feeble
light
she
saw
her
opportunity
to
vault
over
a
careening
chair
and
to
make
a
dash
for
it
a
second
later
she
was
at
lucile
side
lucile
she
said
softly
lucile
the
girl
eyes
were
closed
a
sudden
fear
seized
florence
and
her
heart
stood
still
a
beat
was
lucile
asleep
unconscious
or
or
was
she
dead
over
in
the
darkness
and
storm
by
the
old
scow
mark
pence
was
slowly
regaining
consciousness
at
first
he
imagined
that
a
tiny
train
of
cars
was
running
about
on
the
top
of
his
head
this
illusion
vanished
he
felt
something
hard
in
his
mouth
tried
to
think
what
it
was
he
had
been
gagged
that
was
his
first
thought
no
that
was
it
he
was
breathing
through
the
thing
the
mouthpiece
to
his
mask
that
was
it
he
had
kept
it
in
his
mouth
he
was
fully
conscious
now
but
did
not
attempt
to
sit
up
footsteps
were
approaching
he
heard
a
voice
they
got
away
a
man
voice
grumbled
all
but
one
drunk
that
what
they
was
you
ca
hardly
shoot
drunk
men
the
first
voice
retorted
no
you
ca
well
anyway
we
got
one
the
one
with
the
mask
did
hit
him
hard
he
ought
to
be
coming
round
mark
tried
to
discover
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
place
had
been
raided
the
orientals
had
escaped
they
had
swarmed
out
yelling
like
mad
men
probably
the
quick
action
gas
would
make
them
act
as
if
under
the
influence
of
liquor
probably
they
had
tumbled
the
raiders
over
but
who
were
these
raiders
he
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
the
answer
a
rough
hand
dragged
the
mask
from
his
face
he
looked
up
into
the
frank
blue
eyes
of
a
burly
policeman
you
comin
round
sit
up
why
you
no
oriental
you
a
white
kid
what
you
doin
here
mark
sat
up
and
told
them
what
he
had
been
doing
that
quick
action
gas
now
laughed
one
of
the
men
would
be
bad
stuff
for
the
police
force
now
and
again
suddenly
mark
made
an
effort
to
rise
he
had
thought
of
the
plight
of
his
friends
on
the
o
moo
you
you
help
me
launch
my
schooner
he
exclaimed
what
the
idea
why
you
see
those
girls
in
the
o
moo
do
know
how
to
start
their
engine
somebody
got
to
bring
them
in
what
your
schooner
the
elsie
that
turtle
shell
you
be
committin
suicide
to
go
in
her
you
come
along
with
us
we
holdin
you
as
a
material
witness
and
and
to
prevent
you
from
committing
suicide
by
trying
the
lake
in
that
shell
reluctantly
mark
obeyed
ca
something
be
done
he
demanded
desperately
not
before
morning
not
much
then
probably
how
you
find
a
yacht
blowin
round
loose
in
this
whirlin
bag
of
snow
there
is
a
bottom
to
every
depth
a
state
of
darkness
which
can
not
be
exceeded
a
limit
even
to
despair
as
florence
looked
upon
closed
eyes
she
reached
the
bottom
experienced
the
utter
darkness
found
the
limit
of
despair
and
then
a
strangely
joyous
thing
happened
lucile
eyes
opened
she
smiled
faintly
strange
to
say
in
the
midst
of
this
tumult
she
had
merely
fallen
asleep
florence
took
a
new
and
firmer
grip
on
hope
how
how
do
you
feel
she
stammered
i
think
i
am
better
lucile
whispered
where
are
we
we
all
right
said
florence
quickly
day
is
breaking
the
storm
will
go
down
as
the
sun
rises
they
be
after
us
in
a
tug
in
a
few
hours
we
be
back
on
the
dock
she
said
all
this
very
quickly
not
knowing
how
much
of
it
she
believed
herself
but
feeling
quite
sure
that
lucile
ought
to
believe
it
just
then
a
chair
pitching
across
the
floor
caught
her
behind
the
knees
and
sent
her
sprawling
the
very
shock
of
this
set
her
blood
tingling
believe
we
could
do
something
about
the
furniture
now
it
getting
light
she
told
herself
marian
she
called
come
on
down
and
let
see
what
we
can
do
to
save
things
we
ruined
as
it
is
no
more
university
for
us
it
will
take
all
the
money
we
have
to
put
this
cabin
back
into
condition
but
we
might
as
well
save
what
we
can
a
table
came
lurching
at
her
she
caught
it
as
if
it
were
a
piece
of
gymnasium
equipment
then
rescuing
a
sheet
from
the
floor
she
tied
the
table
to
a
marian
joined
her
in
pursuit
of
the
cabin
furnishings
it
really
grew
into
quite
a
game
if
a
chair
came
at
them
too
viciously
they
were
obliged
to
vault
over
it
and
bring
up
an
attack
from
the
rear
if
a
whole
platoon
of
tables
and
chairs
leaped
at
them
in
the
same
second
they
took
to
the
cots
little
by
little
order
was
restored
when
a
survey
had
been
made
it
was
found
that
one
table
was
broken
to
splinters
two
chairs
had
broken
legs
and
numerous
books
and
pictures
had
been
utterly
ruined
it
might
have
been
worse
said
florence
cheerfully
yes
agreed
marian
we
might
have
gone
to
the
bottom
i
do
believe
the
storm
is
letting
up
she
attempted
to
look
out
of
a
porthole
daylight
had
come
snow
had
ceased
falling
but
a
heavy
fog
was
driving
over
the
turbulent
waters
fine
chance
of
anyone
finding
us
marian
whispered
sh
florence
warned
as
she
shook
a
finger
at
lucile
berth
then
aloud
boo
but
i
cold
where
are
our
clothes
marian
pointed
mournfully
at
a
mass
of
soggy
rags
in
the
corner
no
she
exclaimed
suddenly
no
not
all
we
put
our
evening
skirts
and
middies
and
slippers
in
the
hammock
of
our
berths
and
she
shouted
joyously
they
are
there
still
after
some
desperate
struggles
at
keeping
their
balance
and
dressing
at
the
same
time
they
found
themselves
warmly
clad
and
immediately
matters
took
on
a
different
aspect
i
believe
ventured
florence
that
we
might
get
the
generator
going
there
just
one
place
where
water
would
cause
a
short
circuit
and
that
can
be
dried
out
by
a
candle
then
we
can
put
in
a
new
fuse
and
that
little
old
friend
of
ours
will
be
as
well
as
ever
not
that
i
feel
any
need
of
heat
she
mocked
with
a
shrug
and
shiver
but
you
know
the
supplying
of
warmth
to
our
homes
has
become
a
social
custom
having
taken
a
candle
from
a
drawer
she
lighted
it
lifted
a
trap
door
and
descended
to
the
generator
she
was
relieved
to
note
that
the
o
moo
had
shipped
very
little
water
she
a
dandy
staunch
little
craft
she
sighed
it
a
pity
to
have
abused
her
so
i
like
to
have
a
hand
on
the
person
who
turned
her
loose
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
worked
patiently
on
the
generator
then
there
came
a
sudden
and
the
hardy
little
machine
was
doing
its
work
once
more
at
once
a
drowsy
warmth
began
to
creep
over
the
cabin
the
storm
was
really
beginning
to
abate
waves
no
longer
washed
the
deck
the
o
moo
rose
high
to
fall
low
again
as
great
sweeping
swells
raced
across
the
surface
of
the
lake
but
she
did
not
pitch
and
toss
marian
brought
the
electric
range
up
from
its
hiding
after
wiping
it
dry
she
made
toast
and
tea
the
first
she
gave
to
lucile
then
after
seeing
her
eyes
close
once
more
in
sleep
she
shared
a
scant
breakfast
with
florence
things
are
looking
better
do
you
think
she
sighed
i
am
really
beginning
to
think
we
get
out
of
this
alive
wo
that
be
wonderful
those
questions
smiled
florence
must
be
answered
one
at
a
time
but
i
have
faith
that
they
will
both
be
answered
and
that
we
be
back
in
the
dear
old
city
for
christmas
christmas
two
weeks
off
next
week
is
final
exams
we
just
got
to
be
back
for
them
in
that
case
let
have
a
look
at
the
engine
a
half
hour
later
the
two
girls
dressed
in
greasy
overalls
their
hair
done
in
knots
over
their
heads
their
hands
black
with
oil
might
have
been
seen
engaged
in
the
futile
attempt
to
unravel
the
mysteries
of
the
small
gasoline
engine
which
in
other
days
had
been
used
to
propel
the
o
moo
when
the
wind
failed
to
fill
her
sails
we
might
be
able
to
sail
her
home
suggested
marian
might
said
florence
risking
a
look
out
on
deck
she
opened
a
door
her
eyes
swept
the
space
before
her
her
lips
uttered
a
low
exclamation
gone
mast
canvas
everything
we
ca
sail
home
that
settled
mark
pence
after
his
strange
adventures
at
the
old
scow
was
marched
off
to
the
police
station
where
he
was
allowed
to
doze
beside
the
radiator
until
morning
soon
after
daybreak
he
was
motioned
to
a
desk
where
a
sergeant
questioned
him
closely
regarding
his
knowledge
of
the
events
of
the
night
and
of
the
orientals
who
lived
in
the
old
scow
he
was
able
to
tell
little
enough
and
to
explain
next
to
nothing
when
he
had
told
of
the
disappearance
of
the
o
moo
of
the
grease
on
the
tracks
of
the
sample
he
had
saved
and
of
the
block
of
wood
with
the
cross
embossed
upon
it
the
officer
proposed
that
they
should
together
make
a
trip
to
the
beach
and
go
over
the
grounds
but
these
friends
of
mine
these
girls
in
the
o
moo
he
protested
oh
that
exclaimed
the
sergeant
what
could
you
do
that
was
reported
to
the
station
hours
ago
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
help
us
track
down
the
rascals
who
played
such
an
inhuman
trick
on
your
friends
what
could
have
been
their
motive
demanded
mark
suddenly
that
said
the
officer
is
a
mystery
which
must
be
cleared
up
we
think
we
know
but
you
never
can
tell
are
you
ready
we
have
a
cup
of
coffee
before
we
go
a
half
hour
later
mark
found
himself
standing
once
more
before
the
old
scow
in
the
broad
light
of
day
it
had
lost
much
of
its
air
of
mystery
the
door
had
been
left
open
and
had
been
blown
half
full
of
snow
having
climbed
over
this
pile
of
snow
they
entered
the
hallway
and
descended
the
narrow
circular
stairs
a
hasty
search
told
them
that
the
place
was
deserted
a
careful
examination
revealed
the
fact
that
the
bottom
of
the
scow
had
been
cut
away
that
a
cellar
had
been
dug
beneath
it
then
walled
up
with
cement
regular
underground
den
the
officer
exclaimed
must
have
been
a
swarm
of
them
twenty
or
thirty
i
guess
said
mark
he
had
picked
up
a
clumsily
ax
guess
i
take
that
along
he
said
presently
in
another
room
he
found
a
large
iron
pot
full
of
a
peculiar
grease
that
settles
it
he
murmured
come
on
over
to
my
schooner
they
went
to
his
schooner
a
comparison
of
his
sample
of
grease
with
that
in
the
iron
pot
left
no
doubt
as
to
who
had
greased
the
track
over
which
the
o
moo
had
glided
to
the
water
the
ax
he
had
brought
from
the
scow
had
a
cross
on
one
side
of
it
cut
no
doubt
with
a
chisel
when
the
steel
was
still
hot
the
cross
embossed
on
the
wood
exactly
fitted
in
the
cross
on
the
side
of
the
ax
they
drove
the
ax
in
to
pull
the
nails
mark
explained
then
when
the
cleats
did
give
way
they
used
something
to
pry
the
ax
loose
how
the
ax
came
to
leave
its
mark
you
have
thought
the
noise
would
have
wakened
your
friends
said
the
officer
there
was
a
wild
storm
could
hear
anything
well
said
the
sergeant
yawning
as
he
rose
that
fixes
something
definitely
on
them
that
what
we
been
trying
to
do
for
some
time
next
thing
is
to
catch
them
but
why
did
they
do
it
insisted
mark
well
replied
the
sergeant
since
you
helped
us
and
i
know
you
wo
go
blabbing
i
tell
you
what
we
think
it
was
a
long
story
a
story
so
absorbingly
mysterious
that
mark
started
when
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
a
whole
hour
had
been
consumed
in
the
telling
of
it
so
that
that
smiled
the
officer
as
he
rose
to
go
tell
your
lady
friends
on
this
o
moo
if
you
like
but
not
anybody
else
they
got
a
right
to
know
i
guess
and
they
keep
quiet
about
it
until
the
settled
for
good
and
all
chapter
xiii
land
at
last
florence
stood
upon
the
deck
the
storm
had
swept
it
clean
she
was
clinging
to
a
hand
rail
at
the
side
of
the
cabin
the
water
was
still
rolling
about
in
great
sweeping
swells
fog
hung
low
over
all
strain
her
eyes
as
she
might
she
could
see
but
a
hundred
yards
the
boat
she
discovered
had
no
horn
or
siren
attached
to
it
if
only
we
had
one
she
told
marian
we
could
keep
it
going
then
if
anyone
is
searching
for
us
he
would
be
able
to
locate
us
by
the
sound
she
stood
there
trying
to
imagine
where
they
were
and
what
was
to
be
the
next
scene
in
their
little
drama
all
efforts
to
start
the
engine
had
been
futile
there
are
a
thousand
types
of
gasoline
engines
marian
had
at
one
time
managed
a
small
motor
on
lucile
boat
but
that
one
had
been
of
quite
a
different
type
is
any
use
marian
had
sighed
at
last
we
ca
get
it
going
so
there
florence
stood
thinking
marian
was
in
the
cabin
preparing
some
hot
soup
for
lucile
lucile
condition
was
much
improved
she
was
sitting
up
in
her
berth
that
much
was
good
but
where
were
they
and
whither
were
they
bound
they
had
gone
over
their
supplies
and
had
found
in
all
about
eight
pounds
of
flour
and
part
of
a
tin
of
baking
powder
three
pounds
of
sugar
a
half
pound
of
coffee
and
a
quarter
pound
of
tea
two
tins
of
sardines
a
few
dried
prunes
and
peaches
two
glasses
of
preserves
and
a
few
other
odds
and
ends
beside
these
there
were
still
twelve
cans
of
the
unlabeled
and
unknown
vegetables
and
fruit
i
hope
marian
had
smiled
that
they
are
all
corn
one
can
live
much
longer
on
corn
than
on
pineapple
but
we
ca
live
long
on
that
supply
florence
had
said
soberly
something
has
just
got
to
happen
and
she
had
added
perhaps
it
wo
if
it
were
summer
things
would
be
different
for
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
lake
is
dotted
with
vessels
but
now
they
are
all
holed
up
or
in
dry
dock
only
now
and
then
one
ventures
out
we
may
have
been
blown
out
a
long
way
from
shore
too
probably
were
she
was
thinking
of
all
this
now
at
the
same
time
her
eyes
were
squinting
half
closed
she
was
trying
to
pierce
the
fog
suddenly
she
started
had
she
seen
something
off
to
the
left
a
whitish
bulk
rising
out
of
the
fog
she
could
not
be
sure
well
aware
that
one
eyes
play
tricks
on
him
when
out
at
sea
she
looked
away
then
turned
her
gaze
once
more
to
the
left
gone
she
muttered
never
was
there
at
all
again
she
struck
that
listless
drooping
pose
which
gave
her
whole
body
rest
but
no
she
murmured
there
it
is
again
they
have
come
for
us
they
have
found
us
she
wanted
to
scream
to
tell
the
other
girls
that
help
was
near
but
no
no
she
decided
not
too
soon
it
might
not
be
if
it
is
see
us
the
o
moo
stands
well
out
of
the
water
to
still
her
wildly
beating
heart
she
allowed
her
gaze
to
wander
off
to
the
right
instantly
she
blinked
her
eyes
it
ca
be
she
exclaimed
then
yes
it
is
it
is
another
turning
once
more
to
the
left
she
found
still
another
surprise
two
of
them
off
there
fear
began
to
assail
her
her
forehead
grew
cold
her
hands
trembled
was
it
after
all
a
false
hope
she
had
but
a
moment
to
wait
then
she
knew
the
fog
had
lifted
slightly
she
could
see
farther
could
tell
what
was
closing
down
upon
them
the
shock
was
too
much
for
her
she
sank
limply
to
the
deck
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
wandering
in
a
fog
on
a
rocky
hillside
searching
for
sheep
had
thought
she
saw
them
coming
out
of
the
fog
only
to
discover
that
the
creatures
she
saw
were
prowling
wolves
the
white
bulks
on
the
surface
of
the
water
were
not
boats
searching
for
them
but
cakes
of
ice
and
these
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
were
fast
closing
in
upon
the
o
moo
with
the
water
still
heaving
this
meant
danger
might
indeed
mean
the
destruction
of
their
craft
i
ought
she
struggled
to
her
feet
i
ought
to
tell
the
girls
yet
she
did
not
tell
them
what
was
the
use
she
reasoned
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
and
that
she
could
do
very
well
alone
there
is
something
about
the
gathering
of
great
bodies
of
ice
which
have
been
scattered
by
a
storm
they
come
together
as
if
each
had
a
motor
an
engineer
and
a
pilot
on
board
and
yet
their
coming
is
in
absolute
silence
if
one
cake
chances
to
touch
another
the
contact
is
so
slight
that
there
is
no
sound
and
so
they
assemble
coming
from
all
points
of
the
compass
they
reunite
as
a
great
fleet
might
after
a
mighty
and
victorious
battle
the
o
moo
chanced
to
be
in
the
very
midst
of
this
particular
gathering
as
florence
watched
she
was
thrilled
and
fascinated
now
the
surface
was
a
field
of
blue
cloth
with
a
white
patch
here
and
there
now
the
white
covered
half
now
now
of
the
field
and
now
a
cake
brushed
the
hull
of
the
yacht
ever
so
gently
suddenly
she
realized
that
a
strange
thing
had
happened
the
water
which
had
been
rolling
had
ceased
to
roll
the
ice
did
that
she
whispered
perhaps
it
not
dangerous
after
all
she
watched
until
the
cloth
of
blue
had
been
almost
completely
changed
to
one
of
white
then
burst
into
the
cabin
to
her
unbounded
surprise
she
found
her
companions
sitting
on
berth
with
wrapt
attention
staring
out
of
the
window
is
it
wonderful
whispered
lucile
i
i
thought
it
would
be
terribly
dangerous
said
florence
not
now
said
marian
it
may
be
if
we
come
to
shore
and
the
wind
crowds
the
ice
but
even
then
we
be
safe
enough
we
can
escape
over
the
ice
to
shore
only
she
added
thoughtfully
in
that
case
the
o
moo
will
be
crushed
and
that
would
be
too
sad
after
she
has
carried
us
through
the
storm
so
bravely
florence
still
looked
puzzled
you
see
smiled
marian
lucile
and
i
have
been
in
the
on
the
arctic
so
we
know
do
we
old
dear
she
patted
lucile
on
the
shoulder
uh
huh
smiled
lucile
as
she
settled
back
on
her
pillow
ice
as
marian
had
said
is
quite
a
safe
convoy
of
the
sea
until
some
shore
is
reached
for
hours
they
drifted
in
the
midst
of
the
floe
now
a
sea
gull
came
soaring
and
screaming
about
the
yacht
and
now
he
went
skimming
away
leaving
them
to
the
vast
silence
of
the
conquered
waters
fog
hung
low
over
the
water
and
the
ice
no
hoot
of
a
fog
horn
no
shrill
siren
scream
greeted
their
anxious
ears
a
great
silence
hung
over
all
then
florence
who
was
standing
on
deck
noticed
that
almost
inperceptibly
the
fog
was
lifting
she
had
been
thinking
of
the
last
hours
lucile
who
was
much
better
had
left
her
berth
and
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
upholstered
chairs
marian
was
trying
for
the
hundredth
time
to
start
the
engine
as
florence
thought
this
through
she
found
herself
at
the
same
time
wondering
what
the
lifting
of
the
fog
would
mean
to
them
had
they
after
all
drifted
only
a
short
distance
from
the
city
would
they
be
able
once
the
fog
had
cleared
to
distinguish
the
jagged
shore
which
the
city
sky
line
cut
out
of
the
blue
would
there
be
some
boat
nearer
than
they
had
dreamed
or
had
they
really
drifted
a
long
way
would
they
look
upon
a
shoreless
expanse
of
water
or
would
the
irregular
of
some
unknown
shore
greet
them
the
fog
was
slow
in
passing
she
was
eager
for
the
unveiling
of
this
mystery
impatiently
she
paced
the
deck
then
suddenly
she
paused
shaded
her
eyes
and
looked
directly
before
her
was
there
some
low
dark
bulk
appearing
off
there
before
the
very
course
the
ice
was
taking
for
a
long
time
she
could
not
be
sure
then
with
a
startled
exclamation
she
leaped
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
crying
girls
marian
lucile
look
land
land
ahead
of
the
marian
came
racing
out
on
deck
followed
more
slowly
by
lucile
for
a
moment
they
all
stood
there
looking
it
land
all
right
said
marian
at
last
but
not
much
land
a
little
sandy
island
with
a
great
many
small
evergreen
trees
growing
on
it
i
should
say
or
perhaps
a
point
suggested
lucile
hopefully
you
see
if
it
a
point
we
can
go
back
just
a
little
way
and
find
people
people
with
plenty
of
food
and
and
everything
lucile
had
had
quite
enough
of
this
adventure
it
better
not
to
hope
for
too
much
smiled
marian
for
the
best
be
prepared
for
the
worst
is
my
motto
and
the
worst
she
exclaimed
suddenly
is
that
the
ice
will
begin
to
buckle
and
pile
when
it
touches
that
shore
and
it
will
crush
the
o
moo
said
florence
with
a
gasp
yes
unless
marian
was
studying
the
situation
carefully
unless
we
can
escape
it
for
a
moment
she
said
no
more
then
suddenly
yes
i
believe
we
could
there
are
in
the
cabin
florence
bring
them
will
you
florence
came
back
presently
with
two
stout
poles
some
twelve
feet
long
these
were
armed
with
stout
iron
hooks
and
points
at
one
end
you
see
explained
marian
rapidly
we
are
much
nearer
the
fore
edge
of
the
floe
than
to
either
side
or
to
the
back
and
up
there
some
forty
feet
there
is
a
narrow
channel
reaching
almost
through
to
the
edge
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
we
crowd
the
ice
to
right
and
left
a
bit
until
we
reach
that
channel
then
draw
the
o
moo
through
it
if
we
reach
the
sandy
shore
before
the
floe
does
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
that
the
o
moo
will
be
driven
aground
but
not
crushed
at
all
and
the
best
that
can
happen
is
that
we
will
find
some
sort
of
little
harbor
where
the
yacht
will
be
safe
until
the
wind
shifts
and
the
ice
goes
back
out
to
sea
but
can
we
move
that
ice
florence
face
showed
her
incredulity
it
easier
than
it
looks
come
on
ordered
marian
briskly
throwing
the
rope
ladder
over
the
side
she
sprang
down
it
to
leap
out
upon
a
broad
ice
pan
florence
shuddered
as
she
followed
this
was
all
new
to
her
marian
had
said
that
it
was
easy
but
they
did
not
find
it
so
true
they
did
move
the
o
moo
forward
inch
by
inch
foot
by
foot
fathom
by
fathom
she
glided
forward
but
this
was
accomplished
only
at
the
cost
of
blistered
hands
aching
muscles
and
breaking
backs
all
this
time
the
was
moving
slowly
but
surely
forward
now
it
was
a
hundred
fathoms
from
the
shore
now
fifty
now
thirty
and
now
but
just
at
this
moment
the
yacht
moved
out
into
the
open
water
before
the
floe
at
the
same
time
marian
caught
sight
of
a
narrow
stream
which
cut
down
through
the
sandy
beach
some
fifty
yards
from
the
point
where
they
had
broken
through
if
only
we
can
make
that
channel
she
panted
if
the
water
deep
enough
all
the
way
to
it
we
can
or
if
the
floe
does
come
too
fast
florence
who
thought
she
had
expended
every
ounce
of
energy
in
her
body
took
three
long
breaths
then
having
hooked
her
pole
to
the
prow
of
the
o
moo
began
to
pull
soon
marian
joined
her
on
the
pole
and
together
the
girls
struggled
by
uniting
their
energies
they
were
able
to
drag
the
reluctant
o
moo
length
by
length
toward
the
goal
once
florence
having
entrusted
her
weight
to
a
rotten
bit
of
ice
plunged
into
the
chilling
waters
but
by
marian
aid
she
climbed
upon
a
safer
cake
and
shaking
the
water
from
her
resumed
her
titanic
labors
twice
the
hull
of
the
o
moo
touched
bottom
each
time
they
were
able
to
drag
her
free
at
last
with
a
sigh
they
threw
their
united
strength
into
a
shove
which
sent
her
prow
first
up
the
still
waters
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream
there
remained
for
them
but
one
means
of
reaching
shore
to
swim
with
a
little
marian
plunged
in
she
was
followed
closely
by
florence
twenty
minutes
later
they
were
in
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
and
rough
linen
towels
were
bringing
the
warm
ruddy
glow
of
life
back
to
their
limbs
the
o
moo
was
lying
close
to
the
bank
where
an
overhanging
tree
gave
them
a
safe
mooring
as
florence
at
last
after
having
drawn
on
a
garment
of
soft
clingy
material
and
having
thrown
a
warm
dressing
gown
over
this
sank
into
a
chair
she
murmured
thanks
be
we
are
here
but
after
all
where
is
chapter
xiv
a
phantom
wireless
it
was
night
dark
cloudy
moonless
night
florence
could
scarcely
see
enough
of
the
sandy
beach
to
tell
where
she
was
going
she
had
however
been
over
that
same
ground
in
the
daytime
so
she
knew
it
pretty
well
besides
she
was
going
any
place
just
walking
back
and
forth
up
and
down
a
long
narrow
stretch
of
and
frozen
sand
she
was
thinking
walking
in
the
darkness
helped
her
to
think
when
there
is
nothing
to
hear
nothing
to
see
and
nothing
to
feel
and
when
the
movement
of
one
feet
keeps
the
blood
moving
then
one
can
do
the
best
thinking
anyway
that
was
the
way
this
big
healthy
hopeful
college
girl
thought
about
it
so
she
had
wrapped
herself
in
a
heavy
cape
and
had
come
out
to
think
they
had
been
on
the
island
for
hours
the
ice
had
crowded
on
shore
for
a
time
it
had
piled
high
in
places
now
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
it
was
growing
colder
it
seemed
probable
that
the
ice
would
freeze
into
one
solid
mass
in
which
case
they
would
be
locked
in
for
who
knows
how
long
the
water
in
their
little
natural
harbor
had
taken
on
something
of
a
crust
it
was
possible
that
the
boat
would
be
frozen
into
the
stream
not
that
it
matters
she
told
herself
rather
gloomily
we
ca
start
the
engine
and
as
long
as
we
ca
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
leave
the
island
only
thing
we
can
do
is
wait
until
someone
discovers
our
plight
or
we
are
able
to
hail
a
boat
they
were
on
an
island
they
had
made
sure
of
that
first
thing
she
and
marian
had
gone
completely
around
it
it
was
much
of
an
island
either
just
a
wreath
of
sand
thrown
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
lake
it
could
scarcely
be
more
than
three
miles
long
by
a
half
mile
wide
the
stream
they
had
entered
running
almost
from
end
to
end
of
it
drained
the
whole
of
it
the
highest
point
was
at
the
north
this
point
was
a
sand
dune
some
forty
feet
high
their
boat
was
moored
at
the
south
end
the
entire
island
except
along
the
beach
was
covered
with
a
scrub
growth
of
pine
and
fir
trees
as
far
as
they
could
tell
not
a
single
person
had
ever
lived
on
the
island
it
very
strange
marian
had
said
when
they
had
made
the
rounds
of
it
it
does
seem
possible
that
there
could
be
such
an
island
on
the
lake
without
summer
cottages
on
it
no
it
does
florence
had
answered
what
an
ideal
spot
wonderful
beaches
on
every
side
fishing
too
i
guess
and
far
enough
from
land
to
enjoy
a
cool
breeze
on
the
hottest
day
of
summer
though
they
had
constantly
strained
their
eyes
in
an
endeavor
to
discover
other
land
in
the
distance
they
had
not
succeeded
probably
belongs
to
someone
who
will
not
lease
it
said
florence
at
last
so
here
she
was
trying
to
think
things
through
there
was
danger
of
a
real
catastrophe
the
food
in
their
pantry
could
not
possibly
last
over
ten
days
then
what
as
far
as
she
knew
there
was
not
a
thing
to
be
eaten
on
the
island
it
was
possible
that
fish
could
be
caught
beneath
the
lake
ice
or
in
their
stream
she
meant
to
try
that
in
the
morning
what
a
plight
to
put
one
in
she
exclaimed
who
could
have
done
it
and
why
did
they
do
it
this
question
set
her
mind
running
over
the
mysterious
incidents
which
she
could
not
but
believe
had
led
up
to
this
present
moment
there
had
been
lucile
seeing
of
the
blue
face
in
the
old
mission
her
own
affair
with
the
stranger
in
the
museum
the
blue
candlestick
the
visit
to
cole
in
the
new
museum
lucile
frightful
adventure
on
the
lake
ice
the
incident
of
the
two
men
with
the
sled
on
the
ice
of
the
lagoon
and
the
single
man
sitting
on
the
ice
then
the
spot
of
blue
ice
discovered
next
day
blue
ice
she
exclaimed
suddenly
stopping
still
in
her
tracks
blue
blue
ice
florence
frowned
as
she
considered
it
a
new
theory
had
come
to
her
regarding
that
spot
of
blue
ice
on
the
lagoon
a
theory
which
made
her
wish
more
than
ever
to
get
away
from
this
island
ho
well
she
whispered
at
last
there
probably
be
a
thaw
before
we
get
back
or
those
men
will
come
back
and
tear
it
up
but
if
there
is
if
they
do
then
well
we
see
what
we
see
she
was
still
puzzling
over
these
problems
when
a
strange
noise
leaping
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
smote
her
ear
it
was
such
a
rumble
and
roar
as
she
had
heard
but
once
before
in
all
her
life
that
sound
had
come
to
her
over
a
telephone
wire
as
she
pressed
her
ear
to
the
receiver
during
a
thunderstorm
but
here
there
was
neither
wire
nor
receiver
and
the
very
thought
of
a
thunderstorm
on
such
a
night
was
ridiculous
at
first
she
was
inclined
to
believe
it
to
be
the
sound
of
some
disturbance
on
the
lake
a
sudden
rush
of
wind
or
a
tidal
wave
but
there
is
little
wind
and
the
sea
is
calm
she
told
herself
she
was
in
the
midst
of
these
perplexities
when
the
sound
broke
into
a
series
of
her
heart
stood
still
for
a
second
then
raced
on
as
her
lips
framed
the
word
wireless
so
ridiculous
was
the
thought
that
the
word
died
on
her
lips
there
was
no
wireless
outfit
on
the
yacht
could
be
none
on
the
island
for
had
they
not
made
the
entire
round
had
they
not
found
it
entirely
uninhabited
whence
then
came
this
strange
clash
of
lightning
the
girl
could
find
no
answer
to
her
own
unspoken
questions
after
a
moment
thought
she
was
inclined
to
believe
that
she
was
hearing
the
sounds
created
by
some
unknown
electrical
phenomena
men
were
constantly
discovering
new
things
about
electricity
perhaps
all
unknown
to
them
such
isolated
points
as
this
automatically
served
as
relay
stations
to
pass
along
wireless
messages
not
entirely
satisfied
with
this
theory
she
left
the
beach
and
feeling
her
way
carefully
among
the
small
evergreens
came
at
last
to
the
base
of
a
fir
tree
which
capped
the
ridge
this
tree
apparently
of
an
earlier
growth
towered
half
its
height
above
its
fellows
reaching
up
to
the
first
branch
she
began
to
ascend
she
climbed
of
the
way
to
the
top
with
great
ease
there
she
paused
the
sound
had
ceased
only
the
faint
of
wavelets
on
ice
and
shore
mingled
with
the
mournful
sighing
of
the
pines
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
night
for
some
time
she
stood
there
clinging
to
the
branches
here
she
caught
the
full
sweep
of
the
lake
breeze
she
grew
cold
began
to
shiver
called
herself
a
fool
decided
to
climb
down
again
and
was
preparing
to
do
so
when
there
came
again
that
rumbling
roar
followed
as
before
by
the
that
queer
she
murmured
as
she
braced
herself
once
more
and
attempted
to
pierce
the
darkness
then
abruptly
the
sound
ceased
strain
her
ears
as
she
might
she
caught
no
further
sound
she
peered
into
the
gloom
trying
to
descry
the
wires
of
an
aerial
against
the
but
her
search
was
vain
it
fairly
spooky
she
told
herself
a
phantom
wireless
station
on
a
deserted
island
ten
minutes
longer
she
clung
there
motionless
then
feeling
that
she
must
turn
into
a
lump
of
ice
if
she
lingered
longer
she
began
to
climb
down
i
come
back
here
in
the
morning
and
have
a
look
she
promised
herself
wo
tell
the
girls
they
troubles
enough
she
made
her
way
back
to
the
yacht
and
was
soon
in
her
berth
fast
asleep
it
was
with
considerable
amusement
that
she
retraced
her
steps
next
morning
there
could
not
she
told
herself
be
a
wireless
station
of
any
kind
on
that
island
a
wireless
station
called
for
a
home
for
the
operators
and
there
was
no
such
home
she
and
marian
had
made
sure
of
that
but
then
what
was
it
she
asked
herself
what
could
it
have
been
she
climbed
the
tree
this
time
up
to
its
very
top
then
turning
shaded
her
eyes
to
gaze
away
the
length
of
the
island
just
as
i
thought
she
murmured
nothing
just
nothing
at
all
it
was
true
there
could
be
no
wireless
tower
if
there
had
been
she
could
have
seen
it
what
was
more
there
certainly
was
no
house
on
the
island
had
there
been
she
could
not
have
failed
to
detect
its
roof
from
her
point
of
vantage
there
was
no
house
and
no
wireless
station
yet
as
she
looked
her
lips
parted
in
an
exclamation
of
surprise
she
was
witnessing
strange
things
toward
the
other
end
of
the
island
something
was
moving
in
and
out
among
the
drifting
this
she
made
out
presently
by
the
flash
of
a
paddle
was
some
sort
of
a
boat
and
it
is
she
breathed
no
no
it
ca
be
yes
it
is
it
an
eskimo
kiak
at
once
she
thought
of
the
negontisks
could
it
be
possible
that
they
had
stumbled
upon
a
secret
home
of
some
of
these
people
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
the
strange
manipulator
of
this
queer
craft
drew
the
kiak
on
shore
then
skipping
hurriedly
along
the
beach
and
up
a
sandy
ridge
suddenly
put
two
hands
on
something
and
the
next
instant
dropped
straight
down
and
out
of
sight
florence
caught
her
breath
sharply
she
clutched
the
fir
boughs
in
the
fear
that
she
would
fall
then
realizing
that
she
might
be
plainly
seen
if
anyone
chanced
to
look
her
way
she
began
hastily
to
descend
he
might
come
out
of
his
igloo
and
see
me
she
told
herself
that
the
thing
the
person
had
entered
was
an
igloo
she
had
no
reason
to
doubt
igloos
go
with
kiaks
and
are
built
beneath
the
earth
but
she
said
suddenly
the
other
girls
will
know
a
great
deal
more
about
those
things
than
i
do
i
must
tell
them
at
once
we
will
hold
a
council
of
war
chapter
xv
the
island
secret
hours
after
florence
mysterious
discovery
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
was
pervaded
by
a
quiet
and
studious
atmosphere
lucile
who
was
quite
herself
again
was
mastering
the
contents
of
a
book
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
technique
of
short
story
writing
florence
was
delving
into
the
mysteries
of
the
working
of
the
human
mind
marian
was
doing
a
still
life
study
in
charcoal
one
might
conclude
that
by
some
hosts
of
good
fairies
the
yacht
had
been
spirited
back
to
its
place
on
the
dry
dock
this
was
not
however
the
case
the
o
moo
was
still
standing
in
the
little
stream
on
the
sandy
island
its
position
had
been
altered
a
trifle
it
had
been
poled
out
into
midstream
and
there
anchored
this
precaution
the
girls
had
felt
was
necessary
in
case
the
negontisks
attempted
to
board
the
yacht
it
would
give
those
on
board
a
slight
advantage
it
is
difficult
to
board
a
yacht
from
kiaks
that
the
strange
persons
who
lived
in
holes
beneath
the
sand
dunes
were
these
wild
natives
they
did
not
doubt
for
marian
had
reasoned
who
else
in
all
the
wide
world
would
live
in
such
a
manner
yes
but
florence
had
argued
how
did
they
ever
get
to
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
anyway
the
question
could
not
be
answered
the
fact
remained
that
there
were
people
living
beneath
the
ground
on
this
island
and
that
the
girls
were
afraid
of
them
so
much
afraid
that
they
were
not
willing
voluntarily
to
expose
themselves
to
view
this
was
why
they
were
remaining
aboard
the
o
moo
and
studying
rather
than
attempting
to
catch
fish
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
our
time
florence
had
reasoned
to
this
the
others
had
agreed
but
when
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
somehow
felt
that
they
would
be
back
at
the
university
for
final
exams
they
shook
their
heads
the
food
supply
was
growing
lower
with
every
meal
six
cans
of
the
unknown
fruits
and
vegetables
had
been
opened
and
with
all
the
perversity
of
unknown
quantities
had
turned
out
to
be
fruit
pleasing
but
not
nourishing
there
some
comfort
in
knowing
that
there
are
other
people
on
the
island
at
that
lucile
had
argued
they
probably
got
a
supply
of
food
and
rather
than
starve
we
can
cast
ourselves
upon
their
mercy
how
many
of
them
do
you
suppose
there
are
marian
suddenly
looked
up
from
her
book
to
ask
only
saw
one
answered
florence
but
then
of
course
there
are
others
strange
we
did
see
any
tracks
when
we
went
the
rounds
of
the
island
snowed
the
night
before
but
people
usually
have
things
outside
their
igloos
sleds
boats
and
hunting
gear
not
when
they
in
hiding
there
might
be
fifty
or
a
hundred
of
them
nothing
about
an
igloo
shows
unless
you
chance
to
walk
right
up
to
the
entrance
or
the
skylight
and
we
did
we
she
broke
off
abruptly
as
lucile
whispered
what
was
that
she
had
hardly
asked
the
question
when
the
sound
came
again
a
loud
trill
it
was
followed
this
time
by
a
musical
i
never
heard
a
native
make
a
sound
like
that
exclaimed
lucile
springing
to
her
feet
nor
i
said
marian
sounds
like
a
girl
throwing
caution
to
the
wind
the
three
of
them
rushed
for
the
door
on
reaching
the
deck
they
saw
standing
on
shore
a
very
short
plump
person
with
a
smiling
face
though
the
face
was
unmistakably
that
of
a
white
girl
she
was
dressed
from
head
to
toe
in
the
fur
garments
of
an
eskimo
hello
there
she
shouted
let
down
the
gang
plank
i
want
to
come
aboard
have
any
laughed
florence
wait
a
minute
you
climb
out
on
that
old
tree
we
pole
the
yacht
around
beneath
it
then
you
can
drop
down
on
deck
what
a
spiffy
little
cabin
exclaimed
the
stranger
as
she
entered
the
door
and
prepared
to
draw
her
fur
parka
off
over
her
head
i
expecting
company
when
did
you
arrive
came
in
with
the
smiled
marian
are
are
you
a
captive
asked
lucile
suddenly
and
and
do
they
make
you
live
with
them
captive
live
with
whom
the
girl
eyes
were
big
with
wonder
the
negontisks
the
what
the
negontisks
why
no
child
of
what
are
you
dreaming
i
never
saw
a
negontisk
let
alone
living
with
them
heard
of
them
though
please
explain
she
bounced
down
into
one
of
the
overstuffed
chairs
with
a
little
sigh
of
oh
what
delicious
comfort
you
do
know
how
strange
it
is
to
live
like
an
eskimo
it
trying
at
times
too
it
took
a
great
deal
of
explaining
for
lucile
to
make
the
reasons
for
her
questions
clear
to
the
stranger
in
the
meantime
florence
had
an
opportunity
to
study
their
visitor
very
small
not
weighing
over
ninety
pounds
very
vivacious
decidedly
american
and
considerably
older
than
we
are
was
her
final
analysis
why
my
dear
the
little
lady
cried
when
lucile
had
explained
you
may
put
your
mind
quite
at
ease
besides
yourselves
i
am
positively
the
only
person
on
the
island
what
more
she
smiled
i
have
in
my
igloo
oodles
and
oodles
of
food
enough
for
all
of
us
for
six
months
to
come
the
three
girls
fairly
gasped
in
their
relief
and
delight
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
they
refrained
from
embracing
the
visitor
i
suppose
said
the
stranger
that
you
would
like
to
know
how
it
comes
about
that
i
am
living
here
on
this
island
all
by
myself
and
above
all
things
in
an
igloo
well
you
see
my
uncle
owns
this
island
he
is
a
retired
arctic
trader
for
twenty
years
he
lived
on
the
coast
of
the
arctic
made
a
huge
fortune
in
furs
and
whale
bone
then
he
came
back
to
the
city
to
live
well
you
see
she
sighed
after
a
pause
for
breath
he
had
lived
in
igloos
on
the
arctic
coast
for
so
long
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
cave
he
lived
in
on
the
shores
in
the
noisy
city
so
what
does
he
do
but
buy
this
little
island
and
have
a
wonderful
little
igloo
built
beneath
one
of
its
sand
dunes
of
course
he
does
live
in
his
igloo
all
the
time
just
comes
over
when
he
wishes
to
this
winter
he
is
spending
in
florida
so
he
lent
his
igloo
to
me
i
graduated
from
the
university
last
year
and
i
wanted
to
write
a
book
a
book
about
the
vanishing
race
the
eskimo
sort
of
an
eskimo
ramona
do
you
know
i
had
never
been
in
alaska
but
my
uncle
had
told
me
about
it
nights
and
nights
he
talked
about
nothing
else
so
i
knew
enough
to
make
a
book
all
i
needed
was
the
atmosphere
i
thought
i
could
get
that
best
by
coming
out
here
and
living
in
his
igloo
all
by
myself
paddling
about
in
a
kiak
fishing
through
the
ice
and
all
that
so
that
she
laughed
is
how
i
came
to
be
here
the
three
girls
stared
at
her
with
looks
of
wonderment
in
which
was
mingled
not
a
little
joy
had
she
been
a
fairy
come
down
from
some
magic
kingdom
to
render
them
a
great
service
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
welcome
oh
she
cried
bouncing
up
from
her
chair
you
shall
all
go
to
my
igloo
we
will
have
dinner
together
there
and
and
why
do
you
bring
along
a
few
of
your
things
prepared
to
stay
all
night
you
hardly
be
leaving
no
of
course
you
wo
ice
wo
let
you
it
not
alone
the
ice
said
florence
soberly
we
do
know
how
to
start
our
motor
oh
those
motors
there
now
she
exclaimed
i
never
told
you
my
name
it
marie
neighbor
what
are
yours
the
girls
told
her
motors
are
a
real
bother
she
said
returning
to
her
original
subject
uncle
has
had
six
or
eight
of
them
in
all
on
cars
yachts
and
all
that
not
one
of
them
was
like
any
other
one
i
puzzled
my
poor
old
head
nearly
off
over
them
but
i
always
succeeded
in
making
them
go
they
worse
when
there
no
gas
once
i
tried
a
pint
of
ether
and
some
moth
balls
instead
of
gas
that
came
near
being
my
last
experiment
the
cylinder
exploded
perhaps
i
can
help
you
with
your
engine
let
have
a
look
florence
led
the
way
to
the
engine
room
and
there
switched
on
a
light
marie
studied
the
motor
for
a
moment
but
my
dear
she
exclaimed
at
last
this
wire
should
be
fastened
there
and
that
one
here
you
have
them
crossed
that
will
never
do
hope
you
have
ruined
your
batteries
but
never
you
mind
i
have
a
set
down
at
the
igloo
now
about
the
timer
that
screw
loose
there
off
time
of
course
why
there
nothing
the
matter
with
the
motor
not
really
we
have
it
going
in
a
moment
she
gave
the
balance
wheel
a
turn
there
followed
a
sucking
sound
a
second
turn
brought
a
similar
result
the
third
elicited
a
loud
explosion
and
the
fourth
threw
the
engine
into
such
a
spasm
of
coughing
as
set
the
whole
yacht
there
you
are
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
i
told
you
there
anything
the
matter
she
touched
a
lever
the
engine
stopped
then
she
reached
for
a
handful
of
waste
with
which
to
clean
her
dainty
fingers
now
she
said
shall
we
go
over
to
the
igloo
i
think
the
wind
is
changing
the
ice
may
be
going
out
in
that
case
you
may
be
wishing
to
leave
in
the
morning
the
yacht
will
be
all
right
here
no
one
about
and
no
chance
for
her
to
go
out
of
the
river
throw
a
line
out
and
tie
her
to
the
shore
that
make
her
doubly
safe
delighted
with
this
strange
and
efficient
hostess
the
girls
went
about
the
task
of
making
the
ship
snug
then
having
each
gathered
up
a
small
bundle
of
clothing
went
ashore
by
the
way
said
marie
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
like
to
go
back
to
the
city
with
you
i
work
my
passage
as
chief
engineer
that
would
be
splendid
said
florence
enthusiastically
i
been
worrying
about
the
engine
we
might
get
it
going
and
not
be
able
to
stop
it
and
might
stop
it
and
not
get
it
going
again
laughed
marie
well
glad
that
arranged
a
friend
had
promised
to
come
after
me
but
i
was
talking
to
him
night
before
last
and
he
told
me
his
boat
had
sprung
a
leak
did
think
he
could
come
you
were
talking
with
him
cried
marian
yes
radio
do
you
know
oh
i
did
tell
you
i
have
a
radiophone
for
work
uncle
insisted
on
my
having
it
thought
i
would
be
safe
without
it
when
i
wish
to
talk
to
shore
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
hoist
up
my
two
portable
towers
key
up
my
instrument
and
start
right
in
jabbering
away
i
have
the
wireless
too
and
can
talk
to
my
uncle
way
down
in
florida
florence
took
a
long
breath
so
this
she
told
herself
is
the
explanation
of
the
phantom
wireless
by
the
way
said
marie
your
friends
must
be
anxious
about
you
of
course
they
must
be
i
get
my
little
talking
machine
going
as
soon
as
we
are
at
the
igloo
and
you
may
tell
them
all
your
troubles
also
assure
them
you
be
home
or
the
next
day
oh
how
can
we
thank
you
cried
lucile
do
have
to
laughed
their
hostess
it
does
cost
me
anything
and
i
to
get
a
free
passage
home
for
it
talking
about
things
being
free
she
said
pointing
to
the
splendid
little
evergreens
all
about
them
see
all
those
trees
they
really
should
be
thinned
out
they
free
for
the
asking
yet
there
are
ten
thousand
homes
in
the
city
where
there
will
be
no
christmas
tree
this
year
what
do
you
say
we
cut
down
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
and
take
them
along
we
can
play
santa
to
that
many
families
anyway
i
think
it
a
fine
idea
said
lucile
so
do
i
so
do
i
said
the
others
in
unison
well
then
that
all
settled
and
now
for
a
lark
watch
out
here
the
entrance
to
the
igloo
just
take
a
look
down
then
we
get
up
the
towers
and
start
talking
across
empty
space
to
the
poor
tired
old
city
laughed
marie
chapter
xvi
an
unexpected
welcome
it
an
exact
reproduction
of
an
igloo
exclaimed
lucile
the
three
girls
following
the
example
of
their
hostess
had
dropped
through
a
hole
some
three
feet
square
had
poised
for
an
instant
upon
a
board
landing
to
drop
a
second
three
feet
and
find
themselves
in
a
small
square
room
leaving
this
room
they
had
gone
scooting
along
a
narrow
passageway
to
drop
on
their
knees
and
crawl
through
a
circular
opening
into
a
room
some
twenty
feet
square
why
exclaimed
their
hostess
have
you
seen
an
igloo
somewhere
lucile
smiled
marian
and
i
spent
a
year
on
the
arctic
coast
of
alaska
and
marian
has
lived
most
of
her
life
in
nome
on
behring
sea
why
then
marie
neighbor
face
was
a
study
then
i
just
a
a
what
do
you
call
it
a
chechecko
i
guess
beside
you
oh
no
nothing
like
that
smiled
marian
anyway
you
help
me
with
my
book
wo
you
i
have
it
only
a
third
finished
after
dinner
i
read
that
to
you
and
you
may
tell
me
frankly
whether
it
any
good
or
not
i
tried
a
story
once
myself
said
lucile
with
a
laugh
how
did
you
come
out
with
it
have
come
out
yet
but
i
really
crazy
to
get
back
to
the
city
and
find
out
about
it
i
mailed
it
to
the
editor
of
tales
the
igloo
was
heated
by
genuine
lamps
and
over
these
marie
cooked
her
food
the
pots
and
kettles
were
of
the
antique
copper
type
traded
to
eskimos
by
russians
long
before
the
white
man
reached
the
arctic
shore
of
alaska
the
food
cooked
in
this
manner
over
a
slow
fire
was
declared
to
be
delicious
and
now
said
their
hostess
when
the
dishes
had
been
washed
and
put
away
i
introduce
you
to
my
alcove
bedroom
drawing
aside
a
pair
of
heavy
deerskin
curtains
she
revealed
a
platform
some
six
by
eight
feet
this
was
piled
high
with
skin
rugs
of
all
descriptions
white
bearskin
russian
squirrel
red
fox
and
beaver
rivaled
one
another
in
softness
and
richness
of
coloring
you
see
she
explained
it
sort
of
a
compromise
between
the
narrow
shelf
of
the
eskimo
igloo
and
the
broader
sleeping
room
of
the
chukches
of
siberia
lucile
and
marian
were
fascinated
it
took
them
back
to
the
old
days
of
cape
prince
of
wales
of
east
cape
and
siberia
tell
you
what
exclaimed
lucile
we
all
get
fixed
nice
and
comfy
for
going
to
sleep
then
we
spread
ourselves
out
in
the
midst
of
all
those
wonderful
rugs
and
you
may
read
your
book
to
us
yes
and
you
be
asleep
in
ten
minutes
laughed
marie
no
no
no
we
wo
they
all
exclaimed
then
it
a
bargain
a
few
moments
later
filmy
pink
and
white
garments
vied
in
color
and
softness
with
the
rugs
of
arctic
furs
while
marie
in
a
well
modulated
tone
read
the
beginning
of
the
story
of
nowadluk
the
belle
of
alaska
the
three
companions
were
quite
content
to
listen
the
ways
of
life
seemed
once
more
very
good
to
them
their
friends
had
been
notified
by
radiophone
of
their
safety
they
were
to
return
or
the
day
after
the
wind
had
changed
the
ice
was
already
beginning
to
scatter
now
and
then
lucile
or
marian
would
interrupt
the
reader
to
make
a
suggestion
when
the
end
had
been
reached
they
were
unanimous
in
their
assurance
that
it
promised
to
be
a
wonderful
story
their
only
regrets
were
that
more
of
it
was
not
completed
a
half
hour
later
lucile
and
marian
were
asleep
florence
and
marie
were
talking
in
whispers
florence
had
been
relating
their
strange
and
weird
experiences
while
living
aboard
the
o
moo
so
that
why
you
thought
i
was
held
captive
by
the
negontisks
marie
chuckled
but
really
she
said
presently
there
some
of
those
people
in
chicago
may
be
yet
but
no
one
knows
tell
me
about
it
florence
breathed
excitedly
i
do
know
a
great
deal
about
it
only
they
were
brought
over
from
siberia
for
exhibition
purposes
during
a
fair
in
seattle
from
there
they
were
brought
to
chicago
by
a
show
company
the
company
ran
out
of
money
and
disbanded
the
negontisks
were
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
they
were
getting
along
one
way
or
another
when
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
worshipping
some
kind
of
idol
a
blue
face
whispered
florence
breathlessly
something
like
that
it
was
believed
that
in
their
religious
rites
they
resorted
to
inhuman
practices
the
government
looked
into
the
matter
and
decided
to
deport
them
but
just
when
the
officials
were
preparing
to
round
them
up
they
found
that
the
last
one
of
them
had
vanished
vanished
as
completely
as
they
might
had
the
earth
opened
up
and
swallowed
them
that
was
two
or
three
years
ago
the
papers
were
full
of
it
i
think
there
was
a
reward
offered
for
their
capture
but
i
believe
they
never
found
a
trace
of
them
or
their
blue
god
oh
whispered
florence
suddenly
sitting
up
among
the
robes
oh
i
do
hope
the
ice
is
gone
by
morning
why
are
you
happy
here
yes
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
city
want
to
awfully
you
see
i
think
i
know
where
the
blue
god
is
and
i
want
to
go
and
find
it
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
following
the
night
spent
in
the
igloo
before
they
were
able
to
leave
the
island
ice
still
blocked
their
path
that
first
day
so
they
had
spent
the
whole
day
piling
the
deck
of
the
o
moo
high
with
christmas
trees
since
fate
had
been
kind
to
them
in
landing
them
on
the
hospitable
shores
of
this
island
they
had
been
glad
to
do
this
much
toward
the
happiness
of
others
the
lake
could
never
have
appeared
more
lovely
its
surface
smooth
as
a
mirror
reflected
the
white
clouds
which
drifted
lazily
overhead
the
sun
sending
its
rosy
reflections
over
all
made
each
tiny
wavelet
seem
a
saddle
on
the
back
of
a
fairy
horse
of
dreamland
across
this
dreamland
the
o
moo
cut
her
way
now
they
were
nearing
the
city
for
some
time
they
had
been
seeing
the
jagged
line
of
sky
scrapers
now
they
could
catch
the
outline
of
the
beach
by
the
dry
dock
toward
this
they
pointed
the
prow
of
the
o
moo
a
wireless
telephone
message
had
made
known
to
holmes
the
probable
hour
of
their
arrival
old
timmie
would
doubtless
be
prepared
to
get
the
o
moo
back
upon
her
trestle
but
what
makes
the
shore
all
around
the
dock
look
so
black
puzzled
lucile
just
then
there
came
a
succession
of
faint
and
distant
someone
coming
to
meet
us
lucile
decided
pleased
at
the
thought
then
there
came
another
set
of
poppings
another
and
another
all
in
slightly
different
keys
now
they
could
see
the
gasoline
launches
coming
toward
them
seeming
but
sea
gulls
for
size
at
first
they
grew
rapidly
larger
six
of
them
murmured
marian
i
did
know
we
had
that
many
friends
their
amazement
grew
as
three
other
boats
put
out
from
shore
then
lucile
who
had
been
studying
the
beach
exclaimed
i
do
believe
that
black
spot
about
the
dry
dock
moves
it
seems
to
contract
and
expand
to
waver
backward
and
forward
you
do
think
it
could
be
be
people
why
no
of
course
yes
i
do
believe
it
is
cried
marian
it
the
newspapers
exclaimed
florence
they
published
a
lot
of
nonsense
about
our
silly
adventure
and
all
those
people
have
come
down
to
see
us
come
in
and
the
people
in
those
motorboats
are
reporters
groaned
marian
the
last
of
our
life
on
the
o
moo
that
over
anyway
said
lucile
her
face
was
very
sober
by
the
time
we
paid
for
having
this
yacht
put
back
in
order
i
figure
we
have
about
enough
money
left
to
buy
soup
and
crackers
for
examination
week
and
a
ticket
home
old
university
ho
well
laughed
florence
no
use
being
gloomy
about
it
no
use
being
gloomy
about
anything
life
too
long
for
that
let
make
up
what
tell
the
reporters
they
wo
print
the
truth
anyway
so
we
might
as
well
tell
them
plenty
tell
them
what
you
like
said
marie
neighbor
only
please
do
give
them
the
location
of
my
island
i
do
want
them
to
come
out
there
bothering
me
we
guard
your
secret
never
worry
smiled
lucile
when
the
reporters
boats
swarmed
about
them
the
girls
told
as
little
as
they
could
but
when
later
holmes
came
on
board
with
three
official
reporters
they
gave
them
the
true
story
of
their
adventures
they
were
shown
their
own
pictures
on
the
front
pages
of
all
the
papers
and
were
assured
that
nothing
but
their
adventure
had
been
talked
of
since
their
disappearance
a
woman
had
come
on
board
with
the
reporters
a
trim
matronly
woman
in
a
tailored
suit
at
her
first
opportunity
she
drew
florence
to
one
side
to
talk
with
her
long
and
earnestly
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
is
a
wreck
marian
said
to
holmes
but
really
holmes
you
may
trust
us
to
put
it
back
into
perfect
shape
if
it
takes
our
last
penny
you
may
send
upholsterers
and
decorators
over
as
soon
as
the
o
moo
is
in
dry
dock
tut
tut
exclaimed
the
good
doctor
do
let
that
trouble
you
that
all
provided
for
oh
no
really
you
must
let
us
pay
for
all
that
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
his
eyes
were
twinkling
that
the
o
moo
might
be
insured
in
insured
marian
knees
gave
way
the
news
was
too
good
to
seem
true
then
then
we
can
stay
in
school
yes
but
on
the
o
moo
probably
not
too
much
publicity
you
see
university
people
would
object
and
all
that
do
you
know
but
then
cheer
up
i
fancy
the
lady
dean
is
telling
florence
of
something
which
will
interest
you
all
in
the
meantime
he
exclaimed
we
are
not
getting
ashore
timmie
he
cupped
his
hands
and
shouted
bring
on
the
rowboats
and
tackle
let
get
her
brought
in
chapter
xvii
hot
water
and
a
ghost
it
was
night
the
crowd
that
had
screamed
its
welcome
to
the
returning
o
moo
and
her
crew
was
gone
a
great
truck
loaded
high
with
christmas
trees
had
departed
with
marie
neighbor
bouncing
about
on
top
of
it
the
three
girls
were
in
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
this
they
were
sure
was
to
be
their
last
night
on
board
the
lady
dean
had
told
florence
that
a
flat
belonging
to
the
university
three
rooms
kitchenette
and
bath
was
at
their
disposal
the
rent
seemed
terribly
high
to
them
but
someway
they
must
meet
it
since
the
dean
had
looked
very
sternly
adown
her
nose
and
said
of
course
this
sort
of
thing
can
not
be
gone
on
with
the
university
would
be
scandalized
besides
there
is
no
telling
what
may
happen
to
you
if
you
remain
here
of
course
lucile
said
with
a
long
face
as
the
three
of
them
discussed
the
matter
she
says
it
a
very
nice
apartment
but
it
ca
be
half
as
nice
as
as
the
o
moo
florence
put
in
of
course
not
nothing
ever
can
be
oh
well
marian
sighed
i
guess
we
have
to
do
it
but
i
do
think
the
old
o
moo
is
a
dear
i
should
like
anything
better
than
rambling
through
a
whole
summer
with
her
almost
anywhere
on
the
great
lakes
since
this
was
to
be
their
last
night
they
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
they
had
mark
pence
in
for
hot
chocolate
and
vanilla
wafers
they
told
him
of
their
adventures
and
he
spoke
modestly
of
his
own
so
you
see
he
said
going
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
story
as
he
now
knew
it
when
these
negontisks
found
out
they
were
going
to
be
deported
they
hunted
out
an
unscrupulous
chinaman
who
transformed
them
into
people
of
his
own
race
that
was
hard
they
were
orientals
anyway
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
provide
them
with
black
sateen
suits
and
artificial
pigtails
and
the
transformation
was
complete
then
the
chinaman
saw
a
chance
to
make
a
lot
of
easy
money
he
put
them
to
work
in
his
laundry
virtually
made
slaves
of
them
fixed
up
that
old
scow
for
them
secretly
and
made
them
sneak
back
and
forth
to
work
during
the
night
that
lasted
for
a
time
then
the
greedy
old
chinaman
suddenly
disappeared
negontisks
sacrificed
him
to
the
blue
god
like
as
not
served
him
right
too
but
that
was
where
the
police
took
up
the
trail
the
savages
knew
there
was
trouble
coming
they
thought
you
were
a
plant
that
you
were
set
here
to
spy
on
them
they
been
betrayed
by
some
woman
before
it
seems
when
they
could
get
rid
of
you
by
frightening
you
they
decided
to
cut
you
loose
in
a
storm
and
now
began
florence
now
they
vanished
not
a
trace
of
them
has
been
seen
since
that
night
not
a
trace
not
one
why
then
exclaimed
florence
leaping
to
her
feet
i
invite
you
all
to
a
ghost
hunt
a
ghost
hunt
for
a
blue
god
anything
for
a
last
nighter
agreed
lucile
for
this
type
of
ghost
hunt
said
florence
one
needs
an
ax
and
two
kettles
of
boiling
water
i
provide
the
ax
volunteered
mark
and
we
the
boiling
water
chimed
in
marian
and
lucile
in
unison
it
was
a
strange
little
procession
that
stole
from
the
shadow
of
the
o
moo
a
short
time
later
florence
led
the
way
she
was
profoundly
silent
lucile
and
marian
followed
each
with
a
tea
kettle
of
boiling
water
carefully
poised
at
her
side
mark
as
a
sort
of
vanguard
brought
up
the
rear
with
his
ax
now
and
then
mark
let
forth
a
low
chuckle
sh
marian
warned
you
might
disturb
her
serious
poise
straight
away
toward
the
end
of
the
lagoon
florence
led
them
once
on
the
surface
of
the
lagoon
her
course
was
scarcely
less
certain
until
she
had
reached
a
point
in
the
center
of
the
broad
glistening
surface
should
be
right
about
here
she
murmured
snapping
on
a
flashlight
she
moved
slowly
backward
and
forward
studying
the
ice
beneath
the
circle
of
intense
light
cold
place
for
a
ghost
whispered
mark
ten
thousand
people
have
skated
over
it
and
cut
it
down
ca
tell
maybe
it
gone
florence
said
under
her
breath
but
still
she
kept
up
the
search
water
getting
cooled
off
in
the
kettles
ghost
wo
mind
it
at
all
whispered
mark
pausing
on
tiptoe
for
a
moment
florence
fixed
her
eyes
on
a
certain
spot
then
bending
over
she
brushed
the
ice
clear
of
frost
there
she
announced
there
that
it
right
here
she
pointed
motioning
to
mark
cut
here
no
let
me
have
the
ax
you
might
go
too
deep
with
measured
and
cautious
swings
she
began
hacking
a
circle
in
the
ice
some
two
and
a
half
feet
in
circumference
mark
amusement
had
vanished
curious
as
the
others
he
bent
over
and
watched
in
awed
silence
eight
inches
of
solid
ice
had
been
chipped
up
and
thrown
out
when
they
began
noticing
its
peculiar
blueness
like
a
frozen
tub
of
blueing
whispered
marian
sh
warned
lucile
now
let
have
the
water
florence
took
one
of
the
teakettles
and
poured
the
hot
water
into
the
hole
she
had
cut
as
they
stood
there
staring
with
all
their
eyes
they
thought
they
made
out
the
outline
of
something
like
a
dream
picture
on
the
movie
screen
whispered
marian
lucile
pinched
her
arm
a
face
came
from
mark
suddenly
lucile
gasped
wavered
and
all
but
sank
down
upon
the
ice
the
face
she
cried
in
a
muffled
scream
the
horrible
blue
face
i
thought
it
might
be
florence
voice
was
tense
with
emotion
she
poured
the
second
kettle
of
water
into
the
hole
the
pool
of
water
was
blue
but
through
it
there
appeared
the
dim
outlines
of
an
unspeakably
ugly
face
with
trembling
fingers
florence
tested
the
water
twice
she
found
it
too
hot
the
third
time
she
plunged
in
her
hand
there
followed
a
sound
of
water
being
sucked
up
by
some
object
the
next
instant
she
placed
on
the
ice
within
the
circle
of
light
a
strange
affair
of
blue
stone
covering
her
eyes
lucile
sprang
back
shuddering
the
blue
face
the
terrible
blue
face
marian
and
mark
stared
curiously
florence
straightened
up
that
she
said
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
is
the
marvelous
and
blue
god
oh
ah
came
from
marian
and
mark
lucile
uncovered
her
eyes
to
look
perfectly
harmless
merely
a
blue
jade
carving
nevertheless
a
thing
of
some
importance
unless
i
miss
my
guess
said
florence
i
suggest
that
we
take
it
to
the
police
station
exclaimed
marian
oh
yes
right
now
demanded
lucile
through
chattering
teeth
i
could
never
sleep
with
that
thing
on
board
the
o
moo
arrived
at
police
headquarters
they
asked
for
their
friend
the
sergeant
when
he
came
out
his
eyes
appeared
heavy
with
sleep
but
once
they
fell
upon
the
thing
of
blue
jade
it
seemed
that
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
it
ai
he
exclaimed
it
is
no
it
ca
be
taking
it
in
his
hands
he
turned
it
over
and
over
muttering
to
himself
then
wait
a
minute
he
said
handing
the
blue
face
to
florence
he
dashed
to
the
telephone
there
for
a
moment
he
quarreled
with
an
operator
then
talked
to
someone
for
an
instant
that
he
said
as
he
returned
was
your
friend
cole
from
down
in
the
new
museum
he
lives
near
here
he
coming
over
he
tell
us
for
sure
he
knows
everything
sit
down
for
ten
minutes
nothing
was
heard
in
the
room
save
the
of
a
prodigious
clock
hung
against
the
wall
from
florence
lap
the
blue
god
leered
defiance
to
the
world
suddenly
a
man
without
hat
or
collar
dashed
into
the
room
it
was
cole
where
is
it
he
demanded
breathlessly
here
florence
held
out
the
blue
face
for
a
full
five
minutes
the
great
curator
studied
the
face
in
silence
turning
it
over
and
over
he
now
and
again
uttered
a
little
cry
of
delight
florence
as
she
watched
him
thought
he
could
not
have
been
more
pleased
had
a
son
been
returned
to
him
it
is
he
murmured
at
last
it
is
the
blue
god
of
the
negontisks
see
that
exclaimed
the
sergeant
springing
to
his
feet
i
told
you
he
know
and
that
the
end
of
that
business
the
whole
gang
of
was
caught
in
sioux
city
iowa
last
night
but
they
did
have
the
blue
god
they
be
deported
will
will
you
give
it
back
to
them
now
faltered
lucile
give
it
back
he
roared
i
say
not
you
do
know
what
crimes
have
been
committed
in
the
name
of
the
blue
god
no
no
we
not
give
it
back
if
they
must
have
one
when
they
get
to
where
they
going
have
to
find
a
new
one
sergeant
said
cole
i
like
to
speak
with
you
privately
oh
all
right
the
two
adjourned
to
a
corner
where
for
some
time
they
conversed
earnestly
the
sergeant
might
be
seen
to
shake
his
head
emphatically
from
time
to
time
at
last
they
returned
to
the
group
i
have
been
trying
said
cole
thoughtfully
to
persuade
the
sergeant
to
allow
you
to
sell
the
blue
god
to
our
museum
it
is
worth
considerable
money
merely
as
a
specimen
but
he
wo
hear
to
it
says
it
sort
of
contraband
and
must
be
held
by
the
police
i
sorry
i
sure
you
could
have
used
the
money
to
good
advantage
oh
that
all
right
the
words
stuck
in
florence
throat
hold
on
now
hold
on
exclaimed
the
sergeant
growing
very
red
in
the
face
i
not
so
as
i
might
seem
there
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
offered
for
the
arrest
and
conviction
or
words
to
that
effect
of
this
here
blue
god
now
you
girls
have
arrested
him
and
before
cole
he
been
convicted
all
left
is
to
make
out
the
claims
and
i
do
that
free
gratis
and
for
nothing
five
hun
five
hundred
dollars
the
girls
exclaimed
the
sergeant
stepped
back
a
pace
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
fear
of
the
embarrassment
which
might
come
to
him
by
being
embraced
by
three
young
ladies
in
a
police
station
i
i
lock
him
up
for
the
night
he
muttered
huskily
and
promptly
disappeared
into
a
vault
well
i
guess
that
all
of
that
breathed
florence
quite
a
thrilling
night
for
our
last
on
the
o
moo
not
quite
all
said
cole
there
still
the
blue
candlestick
the
state
makes
no
claims
upon
that
in
the
name
of
the
museum
i
offer
you
two
hundred
dollars
for
it
how
about
it
splendid
wonderful
came
from
the
girls
all
right
come
round
in
the
morning
for
the
check
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
we
we
rich
sighed
lucile
as
they
walked
toward
the
o
moo
but
you
know
i
have
a
private
fortune
she
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
waved
it
in
air
one
hundred
dollars
for
my
story
hooray
hooray
came
from
the
rest
of
course
sighed
lucile
the
editor
said
the
check
would
spoil
me
for
life
but
since
the
story
was
worth
it
he
was
bound
to
buy
it
regular
fatherly
letter
but
he
a
dear
and
the
check
is
real
money
to
eat
has
a
more
pleasant
sound
than
to
sleep
said
florence
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
cabin
of
the
o
moo
what
do
you
say
to
lamb
chops
french
fried
potatoes
hot
coffee
and
doughnuts
at
two
in
the
morning
grinned
mark
what
a
better
time
all
in
favor
say
the
ayes
have
it
there
are
a
few
things
i
do
yet
understand
said
lucile
as
they
sat
enjoying
their
repast
and
a
lot
that
i
do
added
mark
miss
florence
huyler
the
pleasure
all
yours
well
said
florence
it
was
about
like
this
the
negontisks
were
living
in
that
old
scow
instead
of
three
or
four
sleepy
old
chinamen
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
skulking
about
this
dry
dock
being
afraid
of
us
they
tacked
a
note
of
warning
to
our
yacht
when
we
did
leave
they
decided
to
frighten
us
or
kill
us
i
do
know
which
they
chased
me
into
the
old
museum
and
tried
to
surround
lucile
among
the
lucile
seeing
the
blue
face
in
the
old
mission
was
of
course
an
accident
so
too
was
my
finding
the
blue
candlestick
that
man
who
chased
me
lost
it
when
other
plans
failed
they
decided
to
set
us
adrift
which
they
did
but
the
blue
god
frozen
in
the
ice
questioned
marian
you
remember
the
two
men
with
the
sled
and
the
one
man
who
appeared
to
come
from
nowhere
well
i
guess
he
was
dropped
off
the
sled
with
the
blue
god
a
jug
of
blue
water
and
an
ax
he
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
after
covering
the
blue
god
with
blue
water
left
it
to
be
frozen
in
i
stumbled
upon
the
spot
next
morning
little
by
little
i
guessed
what
was
hidden
there
and
how
it
was
hidden
seems
strange
they
never
came
back
for
it
said
lucile
police
were
too
hot
on
their
tracks
declared
mark
they
did
dare
to
and
that
said
florence
is
the
story
of
the
blue
god
quite
an
exciting
episode
we
enter
upon
the
monotonous
life
of
modern
city
cave
dwellers
to
romance
well
said
mark
you
never
can
tell
he
rose
i
must
bid
you
and
i

in
the
of
your
great
university
library
come
to
see
me
there
sometime
perhaps
i
might
dish
up
a
bit
of
excitement
for
you
you
never
can
tell
he
bowed
himself
out
of
the
cabin

minutes
later
the
cabin
was
dark
