to
teachers
the
eskimo
twins
this
is
the
true
story
of
menie
and
monnie
and
their
two
little
dogs
nip
and
tup
menie
and
monnie
are
twins
and
they
live
far
away
in
the
north
near
the
very
edge
they
are
five
years
old
menie
is
the
boy
and
monnie
is
the
girl
but
you
can
not
tell
which
is
menie
and
which
is
monnie
not
even
if
you
look
ever
so
hard
at
their
pictures
that
is
because
they
dress
alike
when
they
are
a
little
way
off
even
their
own
mother
ca
always
tell
and
if
she
ca
who
can
sometimes
the
twins
almost
get
mixed
up
about
it
themselves
and
then
it
is
very
hard
to
know
which
is
nip
and
which
is
tup
because
the
little
dogs
are
twins
too
nobody
was
surprised
that
the
little
dogs
were
twins
because
dogs
often
are
but
everybody
in
the
whole
village
where
menie
and
monnie
live
was
simply
astonished
to
see
twin
babies
they
had
never
known
of
any
before
in
their
whole
lives
old
akla
the
angakok
or
medicine
man
of
the
village
shook
his
head
when
he
heard
about
them
he
said
such
a
thing
never
happened
here
before
seals
and
human
beings
never
have
twins
there
magic
in
this
the
name
of
the
twins
father
was
kesshoo
if
you
say
it
fast
it
sounds
just
like
a
sneeze
their
mother
name
was
koolee
kesshoo
and
koolee
and
menie
and
monnie
and
nip
and
tup
all
live
together
in
the
cold
arctic
winter
in
a
little
stone
hut
called
an
igloo
in
the
summer
they
live
in
a
tent
which
they
call
a
tupik
the
winters
are
very
long
and
cold
and
what
do
you
think
they
have
one
night
there
that
is
four
whole
months
long
for
four
long
months
while
we
are
having
thanksgiving
and
christmas
and
even
lincoln
birthday
the
twins
never
once
see
the
sun
but
at
last
one
day
in
early
spring
the
sun
comes
up
again
out
of
the
sea
looks
at
the
world
for
a
little
while
and
then
goes
out
of
sight
again
each
day
he
stays
for
a
longer
time
until
after
a
while
he
does
go
out
of
sight
at
all
then
there
are
four
long
months
of
daylight
when
there
is
never
any
bedtime
menie
and
monnie
just
go
to
sleep
whenever
they
feel
sleepy
although
many
eskimos
think
twins
bring
bad
luck
kesshoo
and
koolee
were
very
glad
to
have
two
babies
they
would
have
liked
it
better
still
if
monnie
had
been
a
boy
too
because
boys
grow
up
to
hunt
and
fish
and
help
get
food
for
the
family
but
kesshoo
was
the
best
hunter
and
the
best
kyak
man
in
the
whole
village
so
he
said
to
koolee
i
suppose
there
must
be
girls
in
the
world
it
is
no
worse
for
us
than
for
others
so
because
kesshoo
was
a
brave
fisherman
and
strong
hunter
and
because
koolee
was
clever
in
making
clothing
and
shoes
out
of
the
skins
of
the
animals
which
he
brought
home
the
twins
had
the
very
best
time
that
little
eskimo
children
can
have
and
that
is
quite
a
good
time
as
you
will
see
if
you
read
all
about
it
in
this
book
i
the
twins
go
coasting
the
twins
go
coasting
i
one
spring
morning
very
early
while
the
moon
still
shone
and
every
one
else
in
the
village
was
asleep
menie
and
monnie
crept
out
of
the
dark
entrance
of
their
little
stone
house
by
the
sea
the
entrance
to
their
little
stone
house
was
long
and
low
like
a
tunnel
the
twins
were
short
and
fat
but
even
if
they
were
short
they
could
not
stand
up
straight
in
the
tunnel
so
they
crawled
out
on
all
fours
nip
and
tup
came
with
them
nip
and
tup
were
on
all
fours
too
but
they
had
run
that
way
all
their
lives
so
they
could
go
much
faster
than
the
twins
they
got
out
first
then
they
ran
round
in
circles
in
the
snow
and
barked
at
the
moon
when
menie
and
monnie
came
out
of
the
hole
tup
jumped
up
to
lick
face
he
bumped
her
so
hard
that
she
fell
right
into
the
snowbank
by
the
entrance
monnie
did
mind
a
bit
she
just
put
her
two
fat
arms
around
tup
and
they
rolled
over
together
in
the
snow
monnie
had
on
her
fur
suit
with
fur
hood
and
mittens
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
was
monnie
and
which
was
tup
as
they
tumbled
in
the
snow
together
pretty
soon
monnie
picked
herself
up
and
shook
off
the
snow
then
tup
shook
himself
too
menie
was
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
slope
in
front
of
the
little
stone
house
his
head
was
between
his
knees
and
his
hands
held
his
ankles
so
he
rolled
just
like
a
ball
nip
was
running
round
and
round
him
and
barking
with
all
his
might
they
made
strange
shadows
on
the
snow
in
the
moonlight
monnie
called
to
menie
menie
straightened
himself
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
picked
himself
up
and
ran
back
to
her
what
shall
we
play
said
monnie
let
get
koko
and
go
to
the
big
rock
and
slide
downhill
said
menie
all
right
said
monnie
you
run
and
get
your
sled
menie
had
a
little
sled
which
his
father
had
made
for
him
out
of
driftwood
no
other
boy
in
the
village
had
one
menie
father
had
searched
the
beach
for
many
miles
to
find
driftwood
to
make
this
sled
the
eskimos
have
no
wood
but
driftwood
and
it
is
so
precious
that
it
is
hardly
ever
used
for
anything
but
big
dog
sledges
or
spears
or
other
things
which
the
men
must
have
most
of
the
boys
had
sleds
cut
from
blocks
of
ice
menie
sled
was
behind
the
igloo
he
ran
to
get
it
and
then
the
twins
and
the
pups
all
four
started
for
koko
house
koko
house
was
clear
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
but
that
was
not
far
away
for
there
were
only
five
igloos
in
the
whole
town
first
there
was
the
igloo
where
the
twins
lived
next
was
the
home
of
akla
the
angakok
and
his
two
wives
then
there
were
two
igloos
where
several
families
lived
together
last
of
all
was
the
one
where
koko
and
his
father
and
mother
and
baby
brother
lived
koko
was
six
he
was
the
twins
best
friend
ii
the
air
was
very
still
there
was
not
a
sound
anywhere
except
the
barking
of
the
pups
the
voices
of
menie
and
monnie
and
the
creaking
sound
of
the
snow
under
their
feet
as
they
ran
the
round
moon
was
sailing
through
the
deep
blue
sky
and
shining
so
bright
it
seemed
almost
as
light
as
day
there
was
one
window
in
each
igloo
right
over
the
tunnel
entrance
and
these
windows
shone
with
a
dull
yellow
light
in
front
of
the
village
lay
the
sea
it
was
covered
with
ice
far
out
from
shore
beyond
the
ice
was
the
dark
water
out
of
which
the
sun
would
rise
by
and
by
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
in
all
the
twins
world
there
were
no
trees
no
bushes
even
nothing
but
the
white
earth
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
and
the
igloos
the
bright
windows
and
the
moon
shining
over
all
iii
menie
and
monnie
soon
reached
koko
igloo
menie
and
nip
got
there
first
monnie
came
puffing
along
with
tup
just
a
moment
after
then
the
twins
dropped
on
their
hands
and
knees
in
front
of
koko
hut
and
stuck
their
heads
into
the
tunnel
nip
and
tup
stuck
their
heads
in
too
they
all
four
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
except
loud
snores
the
snores
came
rattling
through
the
tunnel
with
such
a
frightful
noise
that
the
twins
were
almost
scared
they
sleep
out
loud
do
they
whispered
monnie
let
wake
them
up
menie
whispered
back
then
the
twins
began
to
bark
just
like
little
dogs
nip
and
tup
began
to
yelp
too
the
snores
and
the
yelps
met
in
the
middle
of
the
tunnel
and
the
two
together
made
such
a
dreadful
sound
that
koko
woke
up
at
once
when
he
heard
four
barks
he
knew
right
away
that
it
must
be
the
twins
and
the
little
dogs
so
he
stuck
his
head
into
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
and
called
keep
still
you
wake
the
baby
i
be
there
in
a
minute
very
soon
koko
popped
out
of
the
black
hole
he
was
dressed
in
a
fur
suit
and
mittens
just
like
the
twins
iv
the
three
children
went
along
together
toward
the
big
rock
monnie
rode
on
the
sled
and
menie
and
koko
pulled
it
the
big
rock
was
very
straight
up
and
down
on
one
side
and
long
and
slanting
on
the
other
the
twins
were
going
to
coast
down
the
slanting
side
they
climbed
to
the
top
and
menie
had
the
first
ride
he
coasted
down
on
his
stomach
with
his
little
kamiks
shoes
waving
in
the
air
next
koko
had
a
turn
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
stood
straight
up
on
the
sled
with
the
leather
cord
in
his
hand
and
slid
down
that
way
but
then
you
see
he
was
six
when
monnie
turn
came
she
wanted
to
go
down
that
way
too
but
menie
said
no
you
fall
off
and
bump
your
nose
you
have
hardly
any
nose
as
it
is
and
you
better
save
it
i
have
as
much
nose
as
you
have
anyway
said
monnie
mine
is
bigger
i
a
boy
said
menie
koko
measured
their
noses
with
his
finger
they
are
just
exactly
alike
he
said
monnie
turned
hers
up
at
menie
and
said
what
did
i
tell
you
menie
never
said
another
word
about
noses
he
just
changed
the
subject
he
said
let
all
slide
down
at
once
koko
and
menie
sat
down
on
the
sled
monnie
sat
on
menie
then
they
gave
a
few
hitches
to
the
sled
and
off
they
went
whiz
how
they
flew
the
pups
came
running
after
them
in
some
places
where
it
was
very
slippery
the
pups
coasted
too
but
they
did
not
mean
to
they
did
not
like
it
the
sled
was
almost
at
the
end
of
the
slide
when
it
struck
a
piece
of
ice
it
flew
around
sideways
and
spilled
all
the
children
in
the
snow
just
then
nip
and
tup
came
sliding
along
behind
them
they
stop
so
there
they
all
were
in
a
heap
together
with
the
dogs
on
top
menie
rolled
over
and
sat
up
in
the
snow
he
was
holding
on
to
the
end
of
his
nose
iyi
iyi
he
howled
i
bumped
my
nose
on
a
piece
of
ice
monnie
sat
up
in
the
snow
too
she
pointed
her
fur
mitten
at
nose
and
laughed
do
you
know
you
have
much
nose
she
said
you
ought
to
be
more
careful
of
it
koko
kicked
his
feet
in
the
air
and
laughed
at
menie
and
the
little
dogs
barked
menie
thought
he
better
laugh
too
he
had
just
let
go
of
his
nose
to
begin
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
little
dogs
stopped
barking
and
stood
very
still
their
hair
stood
up
on
their
necks
and
they
began
to
growl
hark
the
dogs
see
something
said
menie
monnie
and
koko
stopped
laughing
and
listened
they
could
not
hear
anything
they
could
not
see
anything
still
nip
and
tup
growled
the
twins
and
koko
were
children
of
brave
hunters
so
although
they
were
scared
they
crept
very
quietly
to
the
side
of
the
big
rock
and
peeped
over
just
that
minute
there
was
a
dreadful
growl
woof
it
was
very
loud
and
very
near
and
down
on
the
beach
a
shadow
was
moving
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
great
white
bear
he
was
looking
for
fish
and
was
cross
because
everything
was
frozen
and
he
could
not
find
any
on
the
beach
the
moment
they
saw
him
the
twins
and
koko
turned
and
ran
for
home
as
fast
as
ever
their
short
legs
could
go
they
did
not
even
stop
to
get
the
precious
sled
they
just
ran
and
ran
nip
and
tup
ran
too
with
their
ears
back
and
their
little
tails
stuck
straight
out
behind
them
if
they
had
looked
back
they
would
have
seen
the
bear
stand
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
look
after
them
then
get
down
on
all
fours
and
start
toward
the
big
rock
on
a
run
but
neither
the
children
nor
the
little
dogs
looked
back
they
just
ran
with
all
their
might
until
they
reached
the
twins
igloo
then
they
all
dived
into
the
tunnel
like
frightened
rabbits
when
they
came
up
in
the
one
little
room
of
the
igloo
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
kesshoo
and
koolee
were
just
crawling
out
of
the
warm
fur
covers
of
their
bed
menie
and
monnie
and
koko
and
the
little
dogs
all
began
to
talk
at
once
the
moment
the
twins
father
and
mother
heard
the
word
bear
they
jumped
off
the
and
began
to
put
on
their
clothes
they
both
wore
fur
trousers
and
long
kamiks
with
coats
of
fur
so
they
looked
almost
as
much
alike
in
their
clothes
as
the
twins
did
in
theirs
the
mother
always
wore
her
hair
in
a
topknot
on
top
of
her
head
tied
with
a
leather
thong
but
now
she
wanted
to
make
the
bear
think
she
was
a
man
too
so
she
pulled
it
down
and
let
it
hang
about
her
face
just
as
her
husband
did
in
two
minutes
they
were
ready
then
the
father
reached
for
his
lance
the
mother
took
her
knife
and
they
all
crawled
out
of
the
tunnel
the
father
went
first
then
the
mother
then
the
three
children
and
the
pups
at
the
opening
of
the
tunnel
the
father
stopped
and
looked
all
around
to
see
if
the
bear
were
near
the
dogs
in
the
village
knew
by
this
time
that
some
strange
animal
was
about
and
the
moment
kesshoo
came
out
into
the
moonlight
and
started
for
the
big
rock
all
the
dogs
ran
too
howling
like
a
pack
of
wolves
kesshoo
shouted
back
to
his
wife
there
really
is
a
bear
i
see
him
by
the
big
rock
call
the
others
so
she
sent
monnie
into
the
igloo
of
the
angakok
and
menie
and
koko
into
the
next
huts
she
herself
screamed
a
bear
a
bear
into
the
tunnel
of
koko
hut
the
people
in
the
houses
had
heard
the
dogs
bark
and
were
already
awake
soon
they
came
pouring
out
of
their
tunnels
armed
with
knives
and
lances
the
women
had
all
let
down
their
hair
just
as
the
mother
did
each
one
carried
her
knife
they
all
ran
toward
the
big
rock
too
far
ahead
they
could
see
the
bear
and
the
dogs
bounding
along
and
kesshoo
running
with
his
lance
in
his
hand
then
they
saw
the
dogs
spring
upon
the
bear
the
bear
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
tried
to
catch
the
dogs
and
crush
them
in
his
arms
but
the
dogs
were
too
nimble
the
bear
could
not
catch
them
when
kesshoo
came
near
the
bear
gave
a
great
roar
and
started
for
him
the
brave
kesshoo
stood
still
with
his
lance
in
his
hand
until
the
bear
got
quite
near
then
he
ran
at
the
bear
and
plunged
the
lance
into
his
side
the
lance
pierced
the
bear
heart
he
groaned
fell
to
the
ground
rolled
over

still
then
how
everybody
ran
koko
mother
had
her
baby
in
her
hood
where
eskimo
mothers
always
carry
their
babies
she
could
not
run
so
fast
as
the
others
the
angakok
was
fat
so
he
could
not
keep
up
but
he
waddled
along
as
fast
as
he
could
hurry

he
called
to
his
wives
bespeak
one
of
his
hind
legs
for
me
menie
and
monnie
and
koko

such
short
legs
they
could
not
go
very
fast
either
so
they
ran
along
with
the
angakok
and
koko
mother
and
nip
and
tup
when
they
reached
the
bear
they
found
all
the
other
people
crowded
around
it
each
one
stuck
his
fingers
in
the
bear
blood
and
then
sucked
his
fingers
this
was
because
they
wanted
all
bears
to
know
how
they
longed
to
kill
them
as
each
one
tasted
the
blood
he
called
out
the
part
of
the
bear
he
would
like
to
have
the
wives
of
the
angakok
cried

a
hind
leg

alone
every
one
in
the
village
has
a
share
the
bear
was
very
large
he
was
so
large
that
though
all
the
women
pulled
together
they
could
not
drag
the
body
back
to
the
village
the
men
laughed
at
them
but
they
did
not
help
them
so
koolee
ran
back
for
their
sledge
and
harnesses
for
the
dogs
koko
and
menie
helped
her
catch
the
dogs
and
hitch
them
to

they
all
ran
away
and
tooky
the
leader
of
the
team
pretended
to
be
sick
tooky

the
mother
of

and
she
was
a
very
clever
dog
while
koolee

koko

menie
were
getting

sledge
and
ready
the
rest
of
the
women
set
to
work
with
their
queer
crooked
knives
to
take
off
the
bear
skin
the
moon
set
and
the
sky
was
red
with
the
colors
of
the
dawn
before
this
was
done
at
last
the
meat
was
cut
in
pieces
and
kesshoo
and
koko
father
held
the
dogs
while
the
women
heaped
it
on
the
sledge
the
dogs
wanted
the
meat
they
jumped
and
howled
and
tried
to
get
away
when
everything
was
ready
koolee
cracked
the
whip
at
the
dogs
tooky
ran
ahead
to
her
place
as
leader
the
other
dogs
began
to
pull
and
the
whole
procession
started
back
to
the
village
leaving
a
great
red
stain
on
the
clean
white
snow
where
the
bear
had
been
killed
last
of
all
came
the
twins
and
koko
they
had
loaded
the
bear

on

and
though
monnie
had
found
the
bear
just
as
much
as
they
had
she
did
say
a
word
she
just
pulled
away
on
the
sled
and
they
all
reached
the
igloo
together
just
as
the
round
red
sun
came
up
out
of
the
sea
and
threw
long
blue
shadows
far
across
the
fields
of
snow
ii
koolee
divides
the
meat
koolee
divides
the
meat
i
the
first
thing
that
was
done
after
they
got
the
sledge
back
to
the
village
was
to
feed
the
dogs
the
dogs
were
very
hungry
they
had
smelled
the
fresh
meat
for
a
long
time
without
so
much
as
a
bite
of
it
and
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
two
whole
days
they
jumped
about
and
howled
again
and
got
their
harnesses
dreadfully
tangled
kesshoo
unharnessed
them
and
gave
them
some
bones
and
while
they
were
crunching
them
and
quarreling
among
themselves
koolee
crawled
into
the
igloo
and
brought
out
a
bowl
the
bowl
was
made
of
a
stone
and
it
had
water
in
it
this
is
for
a
charm
said
koolee
if
you
each
take
a
sip
of
water
from
this
bowl
my
son
will
always
have
good
luck
in
spying
bears
she
passed
the
bowl
around
and
each
person
took
a
sip
of
the
water
when
menie
turn
came
he
took
a
big
big
mouthful
because
he
wanted
to
be
very
brave
indeed
and
find
a
bear
every
week
but
he
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
the
water
went
down
his
and
choked
him
he
coughed
and
strangled
and
his
face
grew
red
koolee
thumped
him
on
the
back
that
a
poor
beginning
for
a
great
she
said
everybody
laughed
at
menie
menie
hated
to
be
laughed
at
he
went
away
and
found
nip
and
tup
they
would
laugh
at
him
he
knew
he
thought
he
liked
dogs
better
than
people
anyway
nip
and
tup
were
trying
to
get
their
noses
into
the
circle
with
the
other
dogs
but
the
big
dogs
snapped
at
them
and
drove
them
away
so
menie
got
some
scraps
and
fed
them
meanwhile
koolee
stood
by
the
sledge
and
divided
the
meat
among
her
neighbors
first
she
gave
one
of
the
hind
legs
to
the
wives
of
the
angakok
because
he
always
had
to
have
the
best
of
everything
she
gave
the
kidneys
to
koko
mother
to
each
one
she
gave
just
the
part
she
had
asked
for
when
each
woman
had
been
given
her
share
kesshoo
took
what
was
left
and
put
it
on
the
storehouse
the
storehouse
was
really
a
house
at
all
it
was
just
a
great
stone
platform
standing
up
on
legs
like
a
giant
table
the
meat
was
placed
on
the
top
of
it
so
the
dogs
could
not
reach
it
no
matter
how
high
they
jumped
ii
when
the
rest
of
the
meat
was
taken
care
of
koolee
took
the
head
and
carried
it
into
the
igloo
all
the
people
followed
her
then
koolee
did
a
queer
thing
she
placed
the
head
on
a
bench
with
the
nose
pointing
toward
the
big
rock
because
the
bear
had
come
from
that
direction
then
she
stopped
up
the
nostrils
with
moss
and
grease
she
greased
the
bear
mouth
too
bears
like
grease
she
said
and
if
i
stop
up
his
nose
like
that
bears
will
never
be
able
to
smell
anything
then
the
hunters
can
get
near
and
kill
them
before
they
know
it
you
see
koolee
was
a
great
believer
in
signs
and
in
magic
all
the
other
people
were
too
she
called
to
the
twins
come
here
menie
and
monnie
the
twins
had
come
in
with
the
others
but
they
were
so
short
they
were
out
of
sight
in
the
crowd
they
crawled
under
the
elbows
of
the
grown
people
and
stood
beside
koolee
look
children
she
said
to
them
your
grandfather
who
is
dead
sent
you
this
bear
he
wants
you
to
send
him
something
in
five
days
the
bear
spirit
will
go
to
the
land
where
your
grandfather
spirit
lives
what
would
you
like
to
have
the
bear
spirit
take
to
your
grandfather
for
a
gift
i
send
him
the
little
fish
that
father
carved
for
me
out
of
bone
said
menie
he
squirmed
through
the
crowd
and
got
it
from
a
corner
of
his
bed
and
brought
it
to
his
mother
she
put
it
on
the
bear
head
monnie
gave
her
a
leather
string
with
a
lucky
stone
tied
to
it
koolee
put
that
on
the
bear
head
too
then
she
said
there
in
five
days
time
the
bear
spirit
will
give
the
shadows
of
these
things
to
your
grandfather
then
we
can
eat
the
head
but
not
until
we
are
sure
the
bear
spirit
has
reached
the
home
of
the
dead
that
is
well
the
angakok
said
to
the
twins
when
koolee
had
finished
your
grandfather
will
be
pleased
with
your
presents
i
know
your
grandfather
was
a
just
man
i
knew
him
well
he
always
paid
great
respect
to
me
whenever
he
brought
a
bear
home
he
gave
me
not
only
a
hind
leg
but
the
liver
as
well
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
sent
the
bear
this
way
knowing
how
fond
i
am
of
bear
liver
the
angakok
placed
his
hand
on
his
stomach
and
rolled
up
his
eyes
but
times
are
not
what
they
once
were
he
went
on
people
care
now
only
for
their
own
stomachs
they
would
rather
have
the
liver
themselves
than
give
it
to
the
angakok
they
will
be
sorry
when
it
is
too
late
he
shook
his
head
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
koolee
looked
at
kesshoo
she
was
very
anxious
kesshoo
went
out
at
once
to
the
storehouse
he
climbed
to
the
top
and
got
the
liver
by
this
time
all
the
people
had
crawled
out
of
the
igloo
again
and
were
ready
to
carry
home
their
meat
kesshoo
ran
to
the
angakok
and
gave
him
the
bear
liver
the
angakok
handed
it
to
one
of
his
wives
to
carry
the
other
one
already
had
the
bear
leg
he
said
to
kesshoo
you
are
a
just
man
like
your
father
i
know
the
secrets
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
you
know
your
duty
you
shall
have
your
reward
he
looked
very
solemn
and
waddled
away
toward
his
igloo
with
the
two
wives
behind
him
carrying
the
meat
all
the
rest
of
the
people
followed
after
him
and
went
into
their
own
igloos
iii
the
twins
go
fishing
the
twins
go
fishing
i
when
the
people
had
all
gone
away
menie
and
monnie
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
sledge
nip
and
tup
were
busy
burying
bones
in
the
snow
the
other
dogs
had
eaten
all
they
wanted
to
and
were
now
lying
down
asleep
in
the
sun
with
their
noses
on
their
paws
everything
was
still
and
cold
it
was
so
still
you
could
almost
hear
the
silence
and
so
bright
that
the
twins
had
to
squint
their
eyes
in
the
air
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
cooking
meat
menie
sniffed
i
so
hungry
i
could
eat
my
boots
he
said
there
are
better
things
to
eat
than
boots
monnie
answered
what
would
you
like
best
of
everything
in
the
world
if
you
could
have
it
a
nice
piece
of
blubber
from
a
walrus
or
some
reindeer
tallow
said
menie
oh
no
monnie
cried
that
is
half
as
good
as
reindeer
stomach
or
fishes
eyes
how
i
love
fishes
eyes
i
tell
you
menie
get
something
to
eat
and
then

fishing
before
the
sun
goes
down
all
right
said
menie
let
see
if
mother
wo
give
us
a
piece
of
bear
fat
that
is
almost
as
good
as
blubber
or
fishes
eyes
ii
they
dived
into
the
igloo
their
mother
was
standing
beside
the
oil
lamp
putting
strands
of
dried
moss
into
the
oil
this
lamp
was
their
only
stove
and
their
only
light
it
did
look
much
like
our
stoves
it
was
just
a
piece
of
soapstone
shaped
something
like
a
clamshell
it
was
hollowed
out
so
it
would
hold
the
oil
all
along
the
shallow
side
of
the
pan
there
were
little
tendrils
of
dried
moss
like
threads
these
were
the
wicks
over
the
fire
pan
there
was
a
rack
and
from
the
rack
a
stone
pan
hung
down
over
the
lamp
flame
it
was
tied
by
leather
thongs
to
the
rack
in
the
pan
a
piece
of
bear
meat
was
simmering
the
fire
was
not
big
enough
to
cook
it
very
well
but
there
was
a
little
steam
rising
from
it
and
it
made
a
very
good
smell
for
hungry
noses
we
hungry
enough
to
eat
our
boots
menie
said
to
his
mother
you
must
never
eat
your
boots
you
have
but
one
pair
his
mother
answered
she
pinched
menie
cheek
and
laughed
at
him
then
she
cut
two
chunks
of
fat
from
a
piece
of
bear
meat
which
lay
on
the
bench
she
gave
one
to
each
of
the
twins
eat
this
and
soon
you
can
have
some
cooked
meat
she
said
it
is
quite
done
yet
we
do
want
to
wait
for
the
cooked
meat
cried
monnie
we
want
to
go
fishing
before
the
sun
is
gone
give
us
more
fat
and
we
eat
it
outside
you
may
go
fishing
if
your
father
will
go
with
you
and
cut
holes
for
you
in
the
ice
said
her
mother
koolee
cut
off
two
more
pieces
of
fat
the
twins
took
a
piece
in
each
hand
then
their
mother
reached
down
their
own
little
fishing
rods
which
were
stuck
in
the
walls
of
the
igloo
the
twins
had
bear
meat
in
both
hands
they
did
see
how
they
could
manage
the
fishing
rods
too
but
menie
thought
of
a
way
i
show
you
how
he
said
to
monnie
he
held
one
chunk
of
meat
in
his
teeth
in
his
left
hand
he
held
the
fishing
rod
in
his
right
he
carried
the
other
piece
of
meat
monnie
did
exactly
what
menie
did
and
then
they
crawled
down
into
the
tunnel
iii
the
twins
had
some
trouble
getting
out
of
the
tunnel
because
both
their
hands
were
full
and
besides
the
fishing
rods
kept
getting
between
their
legs
when
they
got
outside
they
both
took
great
bites
of
the
bear
fat
kesshoo
was
hanging
the
dogs
harnesses
up
on
a
tall
pole
where
the
dogs
could
not
get
them
the
pole
was
eight
feet
long
and
it
was
made
of
the
tusk
of
a
narwhal
the
harnesses
were
made
of
walrus
thongs
and
the
dogs
would
eat
them
if
they
had
a
chance
that
was
the
reason
kesshoo
hung
them
out
of
reach
the
twins
ran
to
their
father
at
once
they
began
to
tell
him
that
they
wanted
to
go
fishing
right
away
before
the
sun
went
down
but
their
mouths
were
so
full
they
could
get
the
words
out
menie
began
chewing
with
all
his
might
then
monnie
did
a
shocking
thing
she
swallowed
her
meat
whole
she
was
in
such
hurry
it
made
a
great
lump
going
down
her
throat
it
almost
choked
her
but
she
shut
her
eyes
jerked
her
head
forward
and
got
it
down
will
you
make
two
holes
in
the
ice
for
us
to
fish
through
she
said
she
got
the
words
out
first
then
she
took
another
bite
of
meat
have
you
got
your
lines
ready
and
anything
for
bait
asked
their
father
by
this
time
menie
had
swallowed
his
mouthful
too
he
said
we
can
take
a
piece
of
bear
meat
for
bait
the
lines
and
hooks
are
ready
kesshoo
looked
at
the
lines
the
rods
were
very
short
they
were
made
of
driftwood
with
a
piece
of
bone
bound
to
the
end
by
tough
thongs
there
was
a
hole
in
the
end
of
the
bone
and
through
this
hole
the
line
was
threaded
the
line
was
made
of
braided
reindeer
thongs
on
the
end
of
the
line
was
a
hook
carved
out
of
bone
your
lines
are
all
right
said
kesshoo
come
along
he
led
the
way
down
to
the
beach
the
twins
came
tumbling
after
him
and
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
they
gobbled
their
meat
all
the
way
after
the
twins
came
nip
and
tup
the
ice
was
very
thick
kesshoo
and
the
twins
and
the
pups
walked
out
on
it
quite
a
distance
from
the
shore
kesshoo
cut
two
round
holes
in
the
ice
one
was
for
menie
and
one
for
monnie
the
holes
were
not
big
enough
for
them
to
fall
into
by
this
time
the
twins
had
eaten
all
their
meat
except
some
small
pieces
which
they
saved
for
bait
they
each
put
a
piece
of
meat
on
the
hook
then
they
squatted
down
on
their
heels
and
dropped
the
hooks
into
the
holes
kesshoo
went
back
to
the
village
and
left
them
there
do
stay
out
too
long
he
called
back
to
them
iv
the
twins
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
long
time
nip
sat
beside
menie
and
tup
sat
beside
monnie
it
grew
colder
and
colder
the
sun
began
to
drop
down
toward
the
sea
again
at
last
it
rested
like
a
great
round
red
wheel
right
on
the
edge
of
the
world
slowly
slowly
it
sank
until
only
a
little
bit
of
the
red
rim
showed
then
that
too
was
gone
great
splashes
of
red
color
came
up
in
the
sky
over
the
place
where
it
had
been
still
the
twins
sat
patiently
by
their
holes
it
grew
darker
and
darker
the
colors
faded
the
stars
began
to
twinkle
but
the
twins
did
not
move
nip
and
tup
ran
races
on
the
ice
and
rolled
over
each
other
and
barked
at
last
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
fearful
jerk
on
monnie
line
it
took
her
by
surprise
the
little
rod
flew
right
out
of
her
hands
monnie
flung
herself
on
her
stomach
on
the
ice
and
caught
the
rod
just
as
it
was
going
down
the
hole
she
held
on
hard
and
pulled
like
everything
i
believe
i
caught
a
whale
she
panted
but
she
never
let
go
she
got
herself
right
side
up
on
the
ice
somehow
and
pulled
and
pulled
on
her
line
let
me

him
in
cried
menie
he
tried
to
take
her
rod

away
screamed
monnie

in
my
own
fish
menie
danced
up
and
down
with
excitement
still
holding
his
own
rod
the
pups
danced
and
barked
too
monnie
never
looked
at
any
of
them
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
hole
and
pulled
at
last
she
shrieked
i
got
him
i
got
him
and
up
through
the
hole
came
a
great
big
codfish
my
how
he
did
flop
around
on
the
ice
nip
and
tup
were
scared
they
ran
for
home
at
the
first
flop
let
go
home
now
said
monnie
i

fine
big
fish
to

but
menie
said

little
longer
till
i

you
one
eye
out
of
my
fish
if
you
will
monnie
waited
she
put
another
piece
of
meat
on
her
hook
and
dropped
it
again
into
the
hole
after
a
while
she
said
you
can
keep
your
old
eye
if
you
get
it
it
so
dark
the
fish
ca
see
to
get
themselves
caught
anyway
i
cold
i
going
home
menie
got
up
very
slowly
and
pulled
up
his
line
as
they
turned
toward
the
shore
monnie
cried
out
look
look
the
sky
is
on
fire
it
looked
like
it
truly
great
white
streamers
were
flashing
from
the
edge
of
the
world
clear
up
into
the
sky
they
danced
like
flames
sometimes
they
shot
long
banners
of
blue
or
green
fire
up
to
the
very
stars
overhead
the
sky
shone
red
as
blood
the
stars
seemed
blotted
out
the
twins
had
seen
many
wonderful
things
in
the
sky
but
never
such
color
as
this
their
eyes
grew
as
round
and
big
and
popping
as
those
of
monnie
codfish
while
they
watched
the
long
banners
join
themselves
into
a
great
waving
curtain
of
color
that
hung
clear
across
the
heavens
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
they
gasped
they
were
too
astonished
to
move
and
they
were
a
good
deal
frightened
too
they
never
knew
the
sky
could
act
like
that
monnie
felt
her
black
hair
rise
under
her
little
fur
hood
she
seized
menie
coat
do
you
suppose
the
world
is
going
to
be
burned
up
she
said
just
then
they
heard
a
voice
calling
menie
monnie
where
are
you
here
we
are
they
answered
their
teeth
were
chattering
with
cold
and
fright
and
they
ran
up
the
slope
and
flung
themselves
into
their
mother
arms
oh
mother
what
is
the
matter
with
the
sky
they
gasped
then
koolee
looked
up
too
the
long
streamers
were
still
flinging
themselves
up
toward
the
red
dome
overhead
we
call
this
the
aurora
or
northern
lights
and
know
that
electricity
causes
it
but
the
twins
mother
could
know
that
she
told
them
just
what
had
been
told
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
said
that
is
the
dance
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
not
like
this
said
the
twins
this
is
so
big
and
so
red
the
sky
is
not
often
so
bright
said
koolee
some
say
it
is
the
spirits
of
little
children
dancing
and
playing
together
in
the
sky
they
will
not
hurt
you
you
need
not
be
afraid
see
how
they
dance
in
a
ring
all
around
the
edge
of
the
world
they
look
as
if
they
were
having
fun
it
goes
around
the
edge
of
the
world
just
like
the
flames
around
our
lamp
said
menie
maybe
it
the
giants
lamp
menie
and
monnie
believed
in
giants
so
did
their
mother
they
thought
the
giants
lived
in
the
middle
of
the
great
white
world
where
the
snow
never
melts
the
thought
of
the
giants
scared
them
all
the
twins
gave
the
fish
to
their
mother
and
then
they
all
three
scuttled
up
the
snowy
slope
toward
the
bright
window
of
their
igloo
just
as
fast
as
they
could
go
when
they
got
inside
they
found
some
hot
bear
meat
waiting
for
them
and
monnie
had
both
the
eyes
from
her
fish
to
eat
but
she
gave
one
to
menie
when
they
were
warmed
and
fed
they
pulled
off
their
little
fur
suits
crawled
into
the
piles
of
warm
skins
on
the
sleeping
bench
and
in
two
minutes
were
sound
asleep
iv
the
snow
house
the
snow
house
i
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
what
day
it
is
or
what
hour
in
the
day
in
a
place
where
the
days
and
nights
are
all
mixed
up
and
where
there
are
no
clocks
menie
and
monnie
had
never
seen
a
clock
in
their
whole
lives
if
they
had
they
would
have
thought
it
was
alive
and
perhaps
would
have
been
afraid
of
it
but
people
everywhere
in
the
world
get
sleepy
so
the
eskimos
sometimes
count
their
time
by
sleeps
instead
of
saying
five
days
ago
they
say
five
sleeps
ago
the
night
after
the
bear
was
killed
it
began
to
snow
the
wind
howled
around
the
igloo
and
piled
the
snow
over
it
in
huge
drifts
the
dogs
were
buried
under
it
and
had
to
be
dug
out
all
but
nip
and
tup
they
stayed
inside
with
the
twins
and
slept
in
their
bed
the
twins
and
their
father
and
mother
were
glad
to
stay
in
the
warm
hut
at
last
the
snow
stopped
the
air
cleared
and
the
twins
and
kesshoo
went
out
koolee
stayed
in
the
igloo
she
sat
on
her
sleeping
bench
upon
a
pile
of
soft
furs
a
bear
skin
was
stretched
up
on
the
wall
behind
her
she
had
a
cozy
nest
to
work
in
the
lamp
stood
on
the
bench
beside
her
she
was
making
a
beautiful
new
suit
for
menie
it
was
made
of
as
soft
as
velvet
and
the
hood
and
sleeves
were
trimmed
with
white
rabbit
fur
her
thimble
was
made
of
ivory
and
her
needle
too
her
thread
was
a
fine
strip
of
hide
there
was
a
bunch
of
such
thread
beside
her
soon
kesshoo
came
in
bringing
with
him
a
dried
fish
and
a
piece
of
bear
meat
from
the
storehouse
koolee
looked
up
from
her
sewing
is
it
five
sleeps
since
you
killed
the
bear
she
said
kesshoo
counted
on
his
fingers
yes
he
said
it
is
five
sleeps
then
it
is
time
to
eat
the
bear
head
said
koolee
his
spirit
is
now
with
our
fathers
why
not
have
a
feast
said
kesshoo
there
has
been
any
fresh
meat
in
the
village
since
the
bear
was
killed
and
i
do
believe
the
rest
have
had
anything
to
eat
but
dried
fish
we
have
plenty
of
bear
meat
still
koolee
hopped
down
off
the
bench
and
put
some
more
moss
into
the
lamp
you
bring
in
the
meat
she
said
and
tell
the
twins
to
go
to
all
the
igloos
and
invite
the
people
to
come
at
sunset
all
right
kesshoo
answered
and
he
went
out
at
once
to
the
storehouse
to
get
the
meat
ii
when
he
came
out
of
the
tunnel
kesshoo
found
the
twins
trying
to
make
a
snow
house
for
the
dogs
they
were
getting
on
very
well
kesshoo
could
make
wonderful
snow
houses
he
had
made
a
beautiful
one
when
the
first
heavy
snows
of
winter
had
come
and
the
family
had
lived
in
it
while
koolee
finished
building
the
stone
igloo
the
twins
had
watched
him
make
it
it
seemed
so
easy
they
were
sure
they
could
do
it
too
kesshoo
said
if
you
will
run
to
all
the
igloos
and
tell
the
people
to
come
at
sunset
to
eat
the
bear
head
i
will
help
you
build
the
snow
house
for
the
dogs
menie
and
monnie
could
run
nobody
could
the
snow
was
too
deep
they
went
in
every
step
above
their
knees
but
they
ploughed
along
and
gave
their
message
at
each
igloo
everybody
was
very
glad
to
come
and
koko
said
i
come
right
now
and
stay
if
you
want
me
to
come
along
said
the
twins
they
went
back
to
their
own
house
kicking
the
snow
to
make
a
path
koko
went
with
them
the
snow
was
just
the
right
kind
for
a
snow
house
it
packed
well
and
made
good
blocks
while
the
twins
were
away
giving
the
invitations
kesshoo
carried
great
pieces
of
bear
meat
into
the
house
koolee
put
in
the
cooking
pan
all
the
meat
it
would
hold
and
kept
the
blaze
bright
in
the
lamp
underneath
to
cook
it
then
kesshoo
took
his
long
ivory
knife
and
went
out
to
help
the
twins
with
the
snow
house
as
he
had
promised
see
this
is
the
way
he
said
to
them
he
took
an
unbroken
patch
of
snow
where
no
one
had
stepped
he
made
a
wide
sweep
of
his
arm
and
marked
a
circle
in
the
snow
with
his
knife
the
circle
was
just
as
big
as
he
meant
the
house
to
be
then
he
cut
out
blocks
of
snow
from
the
space
inside
the
circle
he
placed
these
big
blocks
of
snow
around
the
circle
on
the
line
he
had
marked
with
his
knife
when
he
got
the
first
row
done
menie
said
i
can
do
that
let
me
try
he
took
the
knife
and
cut
out
a
block
it
was
nice
and
even
like
his
father
blocks
that
will
never
do
his
father
said
your
house
will
tumble
down
unless
your
blocks
are
true
he
made
the
sides
of
the
block
straight
by
cutting
off
some
of
the
snow
now
all
the
other
blocks
in
this
row
must
be
just
like
this
one
he
said
koko
tried
next
his
block
was
almost
right
the
first
time
but
then
as
i
have
told
you
before
koko
was
six
monnie
tried
the
next
one
i
am
sorry
to
say
hers
would
do
at
all
it
was
dreadfully
crooked
they
took
turns
menie
cut
a
new
block
while
koko
placed
the
last
one
on
the
snow
wall
kesshoo
had
to
put
on
the
top
blocks
to
make
the
roof
neither
koko
nor
menie
could
do
it
right
though
they
tried
and
tried
it
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
when
the
blocks
were
all
laid
up
and
the
dome
finished
kesshoo
said
now
monnie
can
help
pack
it
with
snow
monnie
got
the
snow
shovel
the
snow
shovel
was
made
of
three
flat
pieces
of
wood
sewed
together
with
leather
thongs
it
had
an
edge
of
horn
sewed
on
with
thongs
too
monnie
threw
loose
snow
on
the
snow
house
and
spatted
it
down
with
the
back
of
the
shovel
while
she
was
doing
this
menie
and
koko
built
a
tunnel
entrance
for
the
dogs
just
like
the
big
one
on
the
stone
house
they
worked
so
hard
they
were
warm
as
toast
though
it
was
as
cold
as
our
coldest
winter
weather
and
when
it
was
all
finished
menie
ran
clear
over
it
just
to
show
how
strong
and
well
built
it
was
iii
when
the
snow
house
was
all
ready
menie
called
the
three
big
dogs
tooky
was
the
leader
and
the
three
dogs
together
were
kesshoo
sledge
team
tooky
was
a
hunting
dog
too
when
menie
called
the
dogs
the
dogs
thought
they
were
going
to
be
harnessed
so
they
hid
behind
the
igloo
and
pretended
they
did
hear
koko
and
menie
followed
them
but
the
moment
they
got
near
the
dogs
bounded
away
they
went
round
to
the
front
of
the
igloo
and
ran
into
the
tunnel
koolee
was
just
turning
the
meat
in
the
pan
with
a
pointed
stick
there
was
a
piece
of
bear
meat
lying
on
the
bench
the
dogs
smelled
the
meat
they
stuck
their
heads
into
the
room
and
when
koolee
back
was
turned
tooky
stole
the
meat
just
then
koolee
turned
around
she
saw
tooky
she
shrieked
oh
my
meat
my
meat
and
whacked
tooky
across
the
nose
with
the
snow
stick
but
tooky
was
bound
to
have
the
meat
she
ran
out
of
the
tunnel
with
it
in
her
mouth
just
as
menie
and
koko
got
round
to
the
front
of
the
igloo
once
more
they
screamed
tooky
got
the
meat
kesshoo
caught
up
his
and
came
running
from
the
storehouse
the
other
two
dogs
wanted
the
meat
too
they
flew
at
tooky
and
snarled
and
fought
with
her
to
get
it
then
koolee
head
appeared
in
the
tunnel
hole
tooky
was
crouching
in
the
snow
in
front
of
the
tunnel
trying
to
fight
off
the
other
two
dogs
and
guard
the
meat
at
the
same
time
she
was
doing
a
thing
with
her
tail
but
she
was
very
busy
with
all
the
rest
of
her
her
tail
was
pointed
right
toward
the
tunnel
the
moment
she
saw
it
koolee
seized
the
tail
with
both
hands
and
jerked
it
like
everything
tooky
was
so
surprised
she
yelped
and
when
she
opened
her
mouth
to
yelp
of
course
she
dropped
the
meat
just
at
that
instant
kesshoo
whip
lash
came
singing
about
the
ears
of
all
three
dogs
snap
snap
it
went
they
jumped
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
lash
then
koolee
leaped
forward
and
snatched
the
meat
from
under
their
noses
and
scuttled
back
with
it
into
the
tunnel
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
it
is
dangerous
to
snatch
meat
away
from
hungry
dogs
if
kesshoo
been
slashing
at
them
with
his
whip
and
if
menie
and
koko
had
been
screaming
at
them
with
all
their
might
so
the
dogs
were
nearly
distracted
koolee
might
have
been
badly
bitten
just
then
monnie
came
up
with
some
dried
fish
she
threw
one
of
the
fish
over
in
front
of
the
snow
house
the
dogs
saw
it
and
leaped
for
it
then
she
threw
another
into
the
snow
hut
itself
they
went
after
that
she
fed
them
all
with
dried
fish
until
they
were
so
full
they
curled
up
in
the
snow
house
and
went
to
sleep
the
feast
the
feast
i
the
moment
the
sun
had
gone
out
of
sight
all
the
people
in
the
village
came
pouring
out
of
their
tunnels
on
their
way
to
the
feast
at
kesshoo
house
kesshoo
house
was
so
small
that
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
people
could
not
possibly
get
into
it
but
the
eskimos
are
used
to
crowding
into
very
small
spaces
indeed
sometimes
a
man
and
his
wife
and
all
his
children
will
live
in
a
space
about
the
size
of
a
big
double
bed
first
the
angakok
came
out
of
his
igloo
looking
fatter
than
ever
the
angakok
always
found
plenty
to
eat
somehow
both
his
wives
were
thin
their
faces
looked
like
baked
apples
all
brown
and
wrinkled
when
they
reached
kesshoo
house
the
angakok
went
into
the
tunnel
first
now
i
ca
tell
you
whether
he
had
grown
fatter
during
the
five
days
or
whether
the
entrance
had
grown
smaller
but
this
much
i
know
the
angakok
got
stuck
he
could
get
himself
into
the
room
no
matter
how
much
he
tried
he
squirmed
and
wriggled
and
twisted
until
his
face
was
very
red
and
he
looked
as
if
he
would
burst
but
there
he
stayed
other
people
had
crawled
into
the
tunnel
after
him
his
two
wives
were
just
behind
everybody
got
stuck
of
course
because
no
one
could
move
until
the
angakok
did
he
was
just
like
a
cork
in
the
neck
of
a
bottle
kesshoo
and
koolee
and
the
twins
and
nip
and
tup
were
all
in
the
igloo
when
they
saw
the
angakok
face
come
through
the
hole
they
thought
of
course
the
rest
of
him
would
come
too
but
it
did
and
the
angakok
was
mad
about
it
why
do
they
build
igloos
the
way
they
used
to
he
growled
every
year
the
tunnels
get
smaller
and
smaller
am
i
to
remain
here
forever
he
went
on
why
does
somebody
help
me
kesshoo
and
koolee
seized
him
under
his
arms
they
pulled
and
pulled
the
two
wives
pushed
him
from
behind
screamed
the
angakok
you
will
scrape
my
skin
off
he
kicked
out
behind
with
his
feet
his
wives
backed
hastily
to
get
out
of
the
way
that
made
them
bump
into
koko
mother
who
was
just
behind
them
her
baby
was
in
her
hood
and
when
she
backed
the
head
was
bumped
on
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
the
baby
began
to
roar
in
the
tunnel
it
sounded
like
a
clap
of
thunder
the
wives
of
the
angakok
and
koko
mother
all
began
to
talk
at
once
and
with
that
and
the
baby
crying
i
suppose
there
never
was
a
tunnel
that
held
so
much
noise
it
all
came
into
the
igloo
and
it
sounded
quite
frightful
the
twins
crept
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
sleeping
bench
and
watched
their
father
and
mother
and
the
angakok
with
their
eyes
almost
popping
out
of
their
heads
nip
and
tup
thought
they
would
help
a
little
so
they
jumped
off
the
bench
and
barked
at
the
angakok
you
see
they
did
know
he
was
a
great
medicine
man
they
thought
maybe
he
ought
not
to
be
there
at
all
nip
even
snapped
at
the
angakok
ear
that
made
the
angakok
more
angry
than
ever
he
reached
into
the
room
seized
nip
with
one
hand
and
flung
him
up
on
to
the
sleeping
bench
nip
lit
on
top
of
menie
nip
was
very
much
surprised
and
so
was
menie
now
whether
the
jerk
he
gave
in
throwing
nip
did
it
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
at
that
instant
kesshoo
and
koolee
both
gave
a
great
pull
in
front
at
the
same
moment
the
two
wives
gave
a
great
push
behind
and
the
next
moment
after
that
there
was
the
angakok
still
red
and
still
angry
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
sleeping
bench
in
the
best
place
near
the
fire
then
his
two
wives
came
crawling
through
the
angakok
looked
at
them
as
if
he
thought
they
had
made
him
stick
in
the
tunnel
and
had
done
it
on
purpose
too
the
wives
scuttled
up
on
to
the
sleeping
bench
and
got
into
the
farthest
corner
of
it
as
fast
as
they
could
the
women
and
children
always
sat
back
on
the
bench
at
a
feast
when
koko
mother
came
in
the
baby
was
still
crying
she
climbed
up
on
to
the
bed
with
him
and
menie
and
monnie
showed
him
the
pups
and
that
made
the
baby
laugh
again
as
fast
as
they
came
in
the
women
and
children
packed
themselves
away
on
the
sleeping
bench
the
men
sat
along
the
edge
of
it
with
their
feet
on
the
floor
ii
the
smell
of
food
soon
made
everybody
cheerful
when
at
last
they
were
all
crowded
into
the
room
koolee
placed
the
bear
head
and
other
pans
of
meat
on
the
floor
then
she
crawled
back
on
to
the
bench
with
the
other
women
the
angakok
was
the
first
one
to
help
himself
he
reached
down
and
took
a
large
chunk
of
meat
he
held
it
up
to
his
mouth
and
took
hold
of
the
end
with
his
teeth
then
he
sawed
off
a
huge
mouthful
with
his
knife
it
looked
as
if
he
would
surely
cut
off
the
end
of
his
nose
too
but
he
did
when
the
men
had
all
helped
themselves
pieces
of
meat
were
handed
out
to
the
women
and
children
soon
they
were
all
eating
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
and
now
i
think
of
it
their
lives
did
depend
on
it
to
be
sure
i
will
not
speak
about
their
table
manners
in
fact
they
had
any
to
speak
of
they
had
nothing
to
eat
with
the
meat
not
even
salt
but
it
was
a
great
feast
to
them
for
all
that
and
they
ate
and
ate
until
every
scrap
was
gone
the
angakok
grew
better
natured
every
minute
by
the
time
he
had
eaten
all
he
could
hold
he
was
really
quite
happy
and
benevolent
he
clasped
his
hands
over
his
stomach
and
smiled
on
everybody
the
women
chattered
in
their
corner
of
the
and
koolee
showed
koko
mother
the
new
fur
suit
trimmed
with
white
rabbit
skin
that
she
was
making
for
menie
and
koko
mother
said
she
really
must
make
one
for
koko
just
like
it
the
twins
and
koko
talked
about
a
trap
to
catch
hares
which
they
meant
to
made
as
soon
as
the
long
days
began
again
and
the
baby
went
to
sleep
on
a
pile
of
furs
in
the
corner
menie
fed
the
pups
with
some
of
his
own
meat
and
gave
them
each
a
bone
nip
and
tup
buried
their
bones
under
the
baby
and
then
went
to
sleep
too
iii
after
a
while
the
angakok
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
as
he
always
did
when
he
meant
to
tell
a
story
or
sing
a
song
then
he
said
listen
my
children
he
called
everybody
even
the
grown
up
people
his
children
everybody
listened
they
always
listened
when
the
angakok
spoke
the
angakok
knew
the
secrets
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
he
had
told
them
so
many
times
the
people
believed
it
and
it
may
be
that
the
angakok
really
believed
it
himself
though
i
have
some
doubt
about
that
listen
my
children
said
the
angakok
and
i
will
tell
you
wonderful
things
there
is
a
world
beneath
the
sea
you
catch
glimpses
of
that
world
yourselves
in
calm
summer
weather
when
the
water
is
still
and
you
know
that
i
speak
the
truth
then
you
can
see
the
shadows
of
rocks
and
islands
and
glaciers
in
the
smooth
water
far
below
you
see
blue
sky
and
white
clouds
that
is
the
calm
world
in
which
the
spirits
of
the
dead
live
i
have
visited
that
underworld
many
times
i
have
talked
there
with
the
spirits
of
your
ancestors
the
angakok
paused
and
looked
around
to
see
if
every
one
was
paying
attention
then
he
went
on
with
his
story
do
you
remember
how
two
springs
ago
there
were
so
few
walruses
and
seals
along
the
coast
that
you
nearly
died
for
lack
of
food
and
oil
he
said
my
children
it
was
i
who
brought
the
seals
and
walruses
back
to
you
without
my
efforts
you
might
all
have
starved
i
will
tell
you
of
the
perils
of
a
fearful
journey
which
i
undertook
for
your
sakes
then
you
will
see
what
you
owe
to
the
skill
and
faithfulness
of
your
angakok
all
the
people
looked
very
solemn
and
nodded
their
heads
the
angakok
went
on
you
must
know
that
in
the
depths
of
the
underworld
far
beyond
the
beautiful
abode
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
lives
the
old
woman
of
the
sea
there
she
sits
forever
and
forever
beside
a
monstrous
lamp
underneath
the
lamp
is
a
great
saucer
to
catch
the
oil
which
drips
from
it
in
that
saucer
there
are
whole
flocks
of
swimming
about
all
the
animals
that
live
in
the
sea
the
whales
and
walruses
the
codfish
and
the
seals
swarm
in
the
saucer
of
the
old
woman
of
the
sea
that
is
where
they
all
come
from
sometimes
the
old
woman
of
the
sea
keeps
all
the
creatures
in
the
saucer
then
there
are
no
seal
or
fish
or
walrus
along
our
coasts
and
there
is
hunger
among
the
innuit
human
beings
at
the
time
of
my
journey
she
had
kept
all
the
creatures
for
so
long
a
time
in
her
saucer
that
you
and
many
others
were
nearly
dead
for
lack
of
food
it
was
then
that
i
prepared
myself
for
the
perils
of
this
journey
to
the
underworld
i
called
my
tornak
or
guiding
spirit
to
lead
my
steps
without
his
tornak
an
angakok
can
do
nothing
the
tornak
came
at
once
in
answer
to
my
call
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
we
plunged
down
into
the
water
first
we
passed
through
the
beautiful
world
of
spirits
where
it
is
always
summer
this
part
of
the
way
was
quite
pleasant
but
on
the
farther
side
of
that
world
we
came
to
a
fearful
abyss
it
could
be
crossed
only
on
a
large
slippery
wheel
as
slippery
as
ice
i
mounted
this
wheel
and
was
whirled
across
the
chasm
no
sooner
had
i
reached
the
other
side
than
new
terrors
came
upon
me
i
had
to
pass
by
great
cauldrons
of
boiling
oil
in
which
seals
were
swimming
about
a
misstep
would
have
sent
me
plunging
into
the
boiling
oil
and
you
would
have
lost
your
angakok
forever
the
thought
of
this
was
so
dreadful
that
the
angakok
paused
and
wiped
his
eyes
then
he
went
on
again
with
his
story
however
with
great
courage
i
kept
upon
my
way
until
at
last
i
saw
the
old
woman
house
a
deep
gulf
lay
between
us
and
her
dwelling
and
outside
it
stood
a
great
dog
with
bloody
jaws
this
dog
guards
the
entrance
and
he
sleeps
only
for
a
single
moment
once
in
a
very
great
while
for
six
days
i
and
my
tornak
waited
there
for
the
dog
to
sleep
at
last
on
the
seventh
day
he
closed
his
eyes
instantly
the
tornak
seized
my
hand
and
drew
me
across
the
bridge
which
spanned
the
chasm
this
bridge
was
as
narrow
as
a
single
thread
when
we
were
safely
across
the
bridge
we
passed
the
sleeping
dog
and
boldly
entered
the
old
woman
house
the
old
woman
is
terrible
to
look
upon
her
hand
is
the
size
of
a
large
walrus
and
her
teeth
like
the
rocks
along
the
coast
the
angakok
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
however
when
she
looked
upon
me
she
trembled
he
said
she
saw
at
once
that
i
possessed
great
power
and
was
a
great
angakok
i
spoke
to
her
flattering
words
then
i
told
her
of
the
hunger
of
my
children
i
begged
that
she
would
send
the
seal
and
walrus
and
to
our
coast
at
once
but
she
had
no
mind
to
yield
to
my
requests
then
i
stormed
and
threatened
the
angakok
voice
grew
louder
the
walls
shook
with
the
thunder
of
my
voice
at
last
i
seized
her
by
the
hair
i
tipped
over
the
saucer
with
my
foot
my
great
power
prevailed
against
the
mighty
sorceress
the
seal
and
walrus
swam
away
the
birds
flew
into
the
air
and
were
gone
i
had
conquered
the
old
woman
of
the
sea
my
children
were
saved
the
angakok
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
again
in
a
natural
voice
when
i
opened
my
eyes
in
my
own
igloo
again
he
said
the
famine
was
already
over
flocks
of
were
flying
overhead
the
sea
swarmed
with
fish
and
with
walrus
and
seal
every
one
along
the
whole
coast
was
happy
ask
yourselves
is
it
not
so
the
angakok
seemed
very
much
pleased
with
himself
and
he
looked
about
as
if
he
expected
every
one
else
to
be
pleased
with
him
too
all
the
people
were
filled
with
wonder
at
his
great
power
they
began
to
talk
among
themselves
yes
i
remember
the
famine
well
said
koko
father
i
was
away
up
the
coast
that
season
several
died
in
our
village
for
lack
of
food
other
men
remembered
things
about
other
times
when
food
had
been
scarce
it
is
lucky
they
said
to
each
other
that
here
we
have
a
great
angakok
who
understands
all
the
secrets
of
the
world
and
who
can
save
us
from
such
dreadful
things
iv
at
last
kesshoo
said
will
you
tell
us
great
angakok
how
you
make
these
wonderful
journeys
do
you
really
wish
to
know
asked
the
angakok
if
you
do
i
will
summon
my
guiding
spirits
to
tell
you
but
they
will
speak
only
in
the
darkness
kesshoo
took
the
lamp
at
once
and
put
it
out
in
the
tunnel
then
he
placed
a
thick
hide
over
the
entrance
so
that
not
a
single
ray
of
light
came
into
the
room
the
darkness
could
almost
be
felt
everybody
sat
very
still
and
listened
soon
a
heavy
body
was
heard
to
strike
the
floor
with
a
dull
thud
and
a
strange
voice
said
who
calls
me
another
voice
said
you
are
called
mighty
spirits
to
tell
these
children
of
the
labors
of
their
angakok
then
began
all
sorts
of
strange
noises
as
of
different
persons
speaking
all
the
voices
sounded
much
like
the
angakok
and
they
all
said
what
a
great
medicine
man
the
angakok
was
and
how
every
one
in
the
village
must
be
sure
to
do
what
he
told
them
to
at
last
the
angakok
himself
spoke
in
his
own
voice
i
will
tell
you
how
i
make
these
strange
journeys
he
said
my
body
is
now
lying
on
the
floor
at
your
feet
now
i
begin
to
rise
you
can
not
see
me
you
can
not
touch
me
now
i
am
floating
about
your
heads
now
i
am
touching
the
roof
i
can
go
wherever
i
please
nothing
can
stop
me
i
know
the
secret
places
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
i
can
fly
through
the
roof
and
go
at
once
to
the
moon
if
i
wish
to
then
the
voice
was
still
nobody
moved
or
spoke
monnie
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
corner
of
the
bed
but
koko
and
menie
were
still
awake
they
had
listened
to
every
word
about
the
old
woman
of
the
sea
and
how
the
angakok
traveled
to
the
moon
you
know
i
told
you
before
that
koko
was
six
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
things
so
he
spoke
right
out
in
the
dark
when
every
one
else
was
still
he
said
mother
if
the
angakok
can
go
anywhere
he
wants
to
why
could
he
get
out
of
the
tunnel
koko
mother
tried
to
hush
him
up
sh
sh
she
said
and
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
at
least
she
thought
she
did
but
she
made
a
mistake
in
the
dark
and
put
her
hand
over
menie
mouth
instead
menie
tried
to
say
i
never
said
a
word
but
he
could
only
make
queer
sounds
because
koko
mother
hand
was
tight
on
his
mouth
of
course
koko
did
know
his
mother
was
trying
to
keep
him
still
so
he
said
again
why
is
it
mother
koko
mother
heard
koko
voice
speaking
just
as
plainly
as
ever
though
she
was
sure
she
had
her
hand
over
his
mouth
she
was
frightened
magic
magic
she
screamed
bring
the
light
koko
is
bewitched
i
have
my
hand
over
his
mouth
yet
you
hear
that
he
talks
as
plainly
as
ever
koko
tried
to
say
your
hand
is
over
my
mouth
and
menie
tried
to
say
it
over
mine
but
he
could
only
say
because
she
held
on
so
tight
koko
mother
was
making
so
much
noise
herself
that
she
would
have
heard
what
either
one
said
anyway
the
baby
woke
up
and
whimpered
nip
and
tup
woke
up
and
barked
like
everything
kesshoo
got
the
light
from
the
tunnel
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
set
it
on
the
bench
then
every
one
saw
what
was
the
matter
they
all
laughed
all
but
menie
and
the
angakok
the
angakok
said
to
father
you
better
look
after
that
boy
he
is
disrespectful
to
me
that
is
a
bad
beginning
koko
father
was
ashamed
of
him
he
said
koko
is
so
small
but
the
angakok
said
koko
is
six
he
is
old
enough
to
know
better
everybody
was
so
glad
to
see
the
light
again
that
they
all
began
to
talk
at
once
some
one
said
to
kesshoo
tell
us
about
the
long
journey
to
the
south
you
took
once
long
ago
then
everybody
else
listened
while
kesshoo
told
about
how
once
he
had
taken
his
dog
sledge
with
a
load
of
and
seal
skins
on
it
far
down
the
coast
and
how
at
last
he
had
come
to
a
little
settlement
where
the
houses
were
all
made
of
wood
if
they
would
believe
it
he
told
them
that
in
the
bay
before
the
village
there
was
a
boat
as
big
as
the
big
rock
itself
it
had
queer
white
wings
and
the
wind
blew
on
these
wings
and
made
the
boat
go
kesshoo
had
been
out
in
a
kyak
to
see
it
he
had
even
paddled
all
round
it
the
men
on
the
great
boat
had
fair
hair
and
one
of
them
the
chief
man
of
all
had
bought
some
of
kesshoo
skins
and
one
of
his
dogs
the
man
was
a
great
chief
his
name
was
nansen
this
great
chief
had
told
kesshoo
that
he
was
going
to
take
a
sledge
and
go
straight
into
the
inland
country
where
the
giants
live
he
said
he
was
going
to
cross
the
great
ice
no
man
had
ever
done
that
since
the
world
began
kesshoo
thought
probably
the
great
chief
had
been
eaten
by
the
giants
but
he
did
not
know
surely
because
he
had
never
been
back
there
since
to
find
out
and
to
be
sure
if
he
had
been
eaten
by
giants
no
one
ever
would
know
about
it
anyway
then
kesshoo
showed
them
all
a
great
knife
that
the
white
chief
had
given
him
in
exchange
for
a
sealskin
and
two
steel
needles
that
he
had
sent
to
koolee
koolee
kept
the
needles
in
a
little
ivory
case
all
by
themselves
she
always
carried
the
case
in
her
kamik
so
it
would
not
be
lost
she
could
do
wonderful
sewing
with
the
needles
koolee
was
very
proud
of
her
sewing
no
one
else
in
the
whole
village
could
sew
so
well
because
they
had
not
such
good
needles
to
do
it
with
koolee
used
them
only
for
her
very
finest
work
at
last
the
angakok
said
it
is
time
to
go
home
he
called
to
his
wives
they
climbed
down
off
the
bench
that
started
the
others
one
after
another
they
put
on
their
upper
garments
which
they
had
taken
off
in
the
warm
igloo
said
good
bye
and
popped
down
into
the
tunnel
last
of
all
came
the
angakok
turn
then
kesshoo
and
koolee
and
the
angakok
wives
all
began
to
look
very
anxious
the
angakok
looked
a
little
worried
himself
if
he
had
stuck
coming
in
what
would
happen
now
after
he
had
eaten
so
much
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
looked
at
the
hole
he
had
taken
off
his
thick
fur
coat
when
he
came
in
now
he
took
off
his
undercoat
and
his
thick
fur
trousers
he
gave
them
to
his
wives
then
he
stretched
himself
out
just
as
long
as
he
possibly
could
and
slowly
hitched
himself
down
into
the
tunnel
groaning
all
the
way
kesshoo
and
koolee
and
the
wives
waited
until
his
feet
disappeared
and
they
heard
him
scraping
along
through
the
tunnel
then
they
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
the
two
wives
popped
down
after
him
the
last
kesshoo
and
koolee
heard
of
the
angakok
was
a
kind
of
muffled
roar
when
a
piece
of
ice
fell
from
the
top
of
the
tunnel
on
to
his
bare
back
menie
and
monnie
and
the
pups
were
already
sound
asleep
in
their
corner
of
the
bench
when
their
father
and
mother
fixed
the
lamp
for
the
night
and
crawled
in
among
the
fur
robes
beside
them
vi
the
reindeer
hunt

hunt
i
the
day
after
the
feast
it
was
still
very
cold
but
there
were
signs
of
spring
in
the
air
when
menie
went
out
to
feed
the
dogs
he
saw
a
flock
of
ravens
flying
north
and
koko
saw
some
on
the
same
day
two
days
after
that
when
the
twins
and
koko
were
all
three
playing
together
on
the
big
rock
they
saw
a
huge
iceberg
float
lazily
by
it
had
broken
away
from
a
glacier
farther
north
and
was
drifting
slowly
toward
the
southern
sea
it
gleamed
in
the
sun
like
a
great
ice
palace
one
morning
the
air
was
thick
with
fog
when
kesshoo
saw
the
fog
he
said
this
would
be
a
great
day
to
hunt
reindeer
oh
let
me
go
with
you
cried
menie
monnie
knew
better
than
to
ask
she
knew
very
well
she
would
never
be
allowed
to
go
kesshoo
thought
a
little
before
he
answered
then
he
said
if
father
will
go
too
you
and
koko
may
both
go
with
us
you
are
pretty
small
to
go
hunting
but
boys
can
not
begin
too
early
to
learn
menie
was
wild
with
joy
he
rushed
to
koko
house
and
told
him
and
his
father
what
kesshoo
had
said
when
he
had
finished
koko
father
said
at
once
tell
kesshoo
we
will
go
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
ready
to
start
kesshoo
had
his
great
bow
and
arrows
and
a
spear
he
also
had
his
bird
dart
koko
father
had
his
bow
and
spear
and
dart
too
menie
had
his
little
bow
and
arrows
kesshoo
put
a
harness
on
tooky
and
tied
the
end
of
tooky
harness
trace
around
menie
waist
koko
father
had
brought
his
best
dog
too
and
koko
was
fastened
to
the
end
of
that
dog
harness
in
the
same
way
then
the
four
hunters
started
on
their
journey
menie
and
koko
driving
the
dogs
in
front
of
them
monnie
stood
on
the
big
rock
and
watched
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
in
the
fog
nip
and
tup
were
with
her
they
wanted
to
go
as
much
as
monnie
did
and
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
them
from
following
after
the
hunters
ii
kesshoo
knew
very
well
where
to
look
for
the
reindeer
he
led
the
way
up
a
steep
gorge
where
the
first
green
moss
appeared
in
the
spring
they
all
four
walked
quietly
along
for
several
miles
when
they
got
nearly
to
the
head
of
the
gorge
kesshoo
stopped
he
said
to
the
boys
you
must
not
make
any
noise
yourselves
and
you
must
not
let
the
dogs
bark
if
you
do
there
will
be
no
reindeer
today
the
boys
kept
very
still
indeed
the
dogs
were
good
hunting
dogs
they
knew
better
than
to
bark
they
walked
on
a
little
farther
then
kesshoo
came
very
near
the
others
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
he
said
we
are
coming
to
a
spot
where
there
are
likely
to
be
reindeer
the
wind
is
from
the
south
if
we
keep
on
in
this
direction
the
reindeer
will
smell
us
we
must
go
round
in
such
a
way
that
the
wind
will
carry
the
scent
from
them
to
us
not
from
us
to
them
they
turned
to
the
right
and
went
round
to
the
north
they
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
in
this
direction
when
they
found
fresh
reindeer
tracks
in
the
snow
the
dogs
began
to
sniff
and
strain
at
their
harnesses
they
smell
the
game
whispered
kesshoo
hold
on
tight
do
let
them
run
menie
and
koko
held
the
dogs
back
as
hard
as
they
could
kesshoo
and
koko
father
crept
forward
with
their
bows
in
their
hands
the
fog
was
so
thick
they
could
not
see
very
far
before
them
they
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
when
out
of
the
fog
loomed
two
great
gray
shadows
instantly
the
two
men
dropped
on
their
knees
and
took
careful
aim
the
reindeer
did
not
see
them
they
did
not
know
that
anything
was
near
until
they
felt
the
sting
of
the
hunters
arrows
one
reindeer
dropped
to
the
earth
the
other
was
not
killed
he
flung
his
head
in
the
air
and
galloped
away
and
they
could
hear
the
thud
thud
of
his
hoofs
long
after
he
had
disappeared
in
the
fog
the
moment
the
dogs
heard
the
singing
sound
of
the
arrows
they
bounded
forward
koko
and
menie
were
not
strong
enough
to
hold
them
back
and
they
could
not
run
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
them
so
they
just
bumped
along
behind
the
dogs
some
of
the
time
they
slid
through
the
snow
the
snow
was
rough
and
hard
and
it
hurt
a
good
deal
to
be
dragged
through
it
as
if
they
were
sledges
but
eskimo
boys
are
used
to
bumps
and
they
knew
if
they
cried
they
might
scare
the
game
so
they
never
even
whimpered
it
was
lucky
for
them
that
they
had
not
far
to
go
when
they
came
bumping
along
kesshoo
and
koko
father
laughed
at
them
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
they
called
there
plenty
of
time
they
unbound
the
traces
from
menie
and
koko
and
hitched
the
dogs
to
the
body
of
the
reindeer
then
they
all
started
back
to
the
village
with
koko
father
driving
the
dogs
soon
the
fog
lifted
and
the
sky
grew
clear
monnie
was
playing
with
her
doll
in
the
igloo
when
she
heard
tooky
bark
she
knew
it
was
tooky
at
once
she
and
koolee
both
plunged
into
the
tunnel
like
mice
down
a
mouse
hole
nip
and
tup
were
ahead
of
them
outside
they
found
koko
mother
and
the
baby
koolee
called
to
her
and
she
called
to
the
wives
of
the
angakok
who
were
scraping
a
skin
in
the
snow
the
angakok
wives
and
koko
mother
and
her
baby
and
koolee
and
monnie
and
nip
and
tup
all
ran
to
meet
the
hunters
and
you
never
saw
two
prouder
boys
than
koko
and
menie
when
they
showed
the
reindeer
to
their
mothers
the
mothers
were
proud
of
their
young
hunters
too
koolee
said
soon
we
shall
have
another
man
in
our
family
when
they
were
quite
near
the
village
again
they
met
the
angakok
he
had
been
trying
to
catch
up
with
them
and
he
was
out
of
breath
from
running
he
looked
at
them
sternly
why
did
you
call
me
he
panted
his
wives
looked
frightened
and
did
say
a
word
nobody
else
said
anything
the
angakok
glared
at
them
all
for
a
moment
then
he
poked
the
reindeer
with
his
fingers
to
see
if
it
was
fat
and
said
to
the
men
which
portion
am
i
to
have
would
you
like
the
liver
asked
kesshoo
he
remembered
about
the
bear
liver
you
see
but
the
angakok
looked
offended
who
will
have
the
stomach
he
said
you
know
very
well
that
the
stomach
is
the
best
part
of
a
reindeer
take
the
stomach
by
all
means
then
said
kesshoo
politely
koolee
and
monnie
looked
very
much
disappointed
they
wanted
the
stomach
dreadfully
but
the
angakok
answered
since
you
urge
me
i
will
take
the
stomach
i
had
a
dream
last
night
and
in
the
dream
i
was
told
by
my
tornak
that
today
i
should
feed
upon
a
reindeer
stomach
given
me
by
one
of
my
grateful
children
when
you
think
how
i
suffered
to
bring
food
to
you
i
am
sure
you
will
wish
to
provide
me
with
whatever
it
seems
best
that
i
should
have
he
stood
by
while
kesshoo
and
koko
father
skinned
the
reindeer
and
cut
it
in
pieces
then
he
took
the
stomach
and
disappeared
into
his
igloo
with
his
face
all
wreathed
in
smiles
vii
what
happened
when
menie
and
koko
went
hunting
by
themselves
what
happened
when
menie
and
koko
went
hunting
by
themselves
i
it
was
very
lucky
for
the
twins
that
their
father
was
such
a
brave
and
skillful
kyak
man
you
will
see
the
reason
why
when
i
tell
you
the
story
of
the
day
menie
and
koko
went
hunting
alone
on
the
ice
one
april
morning
kesshoo
was
working
on
his
kyak
to
make
sure
that
it
was
in
perfect
order
for
the
spring
walrus
hunting
koko
and
menie
watched
him
for
a
long
time
monnie
was
with
koolee
in
the
hut
by
and
by
koko
said
to
menie
let
go
out
on
the
ice
and
hunt
for
all
right
said
menie

your
bow
and
arrows
and
i
take
my
spear
maybe
we
shall
see
some
little
auks
koko
had
a
little
bow
made
of
deer
horns
and
some
bone

and
menie
had
a
small
spear
which
his
father
had
made
for

out
of
driftwood
i
tell

said
menie

the
way

shooting
and
i
do

surprised
to
see

a
great
load
of
game
i
shall
give
everything
i
get
to
my
mother
i
going
to
hunt
birds
and
too
koko
answered
kesshoo
was
very
busy
fixing
the
fastening
of
his
harpoon
and
he
did
not
hear
what
they
said
the
two
boys
went
to
their
homes
for
their
weapons
and
then
ran
out
on
the
ice
nobody
knew
where
they
were
of
course
nip
and
tup
went
along
ii
all
the
way
over
the
ice
they
looked
for
it
takes
sharp
eyes
to
find
them
for
are
very
small
you
see
the
mother
seals
try
to
find
the
safest
place
they
can
to
hide
their
babies
and
this
is
the
way
they
do
it
as
soon
as
the
ice
begins
to
freeze
in
the
autumn
the
seals
gnaw
holes
in
it
to
reach
the
air
and
they
keep
these
holes
open
all
winter
it
freezes
so
fast
in
that
cold
country
that
they
have
to
be
busy
almost
every
minute
all
through
the
winter
breaking
away
the
ice
there
they
get
their
sleep
in
snatches
of
a
minute
or
so
at
a
time
and
between
their
naps
they
clear
the
ice
from
their
breathing
holes
there
is
usually
a
deep
layer
of
snow
over
the
ice
each
mother
seal
hollows
out
a
little
igloo
under
the
snow
around
her
breathing
hole
and
leaves
a
tiny
hole
in
the
top
of
it
so
her
baby
can
have
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
be
hidden
from
sight
at
the
same
time
the
mother
seal
leaves
the
baby
in
the
snow
house
and
she
herself
dives
through
the
hole
and
swims
away
every
few
minutes
she
comes
back
to
breathe
and
to
see
that
her
baby
is
safe
it
was
the
tiny
hole
in
the
top
of
the
seal
snow
house
that
menie
and
koko
hoped
to
find
the
days
had
grown
quite
long
by
this
time
and
there
was
fog
in
the
air
once
in
a
while
there
would
be
a
loud
crackling
noise
the
ice
is
beginning
to
break
koko
said
do
you
hear
it
pop
my
father
says
he
thinks
the
warm
weather
will
begin
early
this
year
they
had
gone
some
distance
out
on
the
ice
when
suddenly
menie
said
look
look
there
he
pointed
toward
the
north
there
not
far
from
shore
was
a
flock
of
resting
on
the
ice
just
let

any
sense

scare
them
iii
koko
ran
swiftly
and
quietly
towards
the
birds
menie
sat
on
the
ice
and
watched
him
and
held
nip
and
tup
one
under
each
arm
when
koko
got
quite
near
the
birds
he
took
careful
aim
and
let
fly
an
arrow
at
them
it
did
hit
any
of
the
birds
but
it
frightened
them
they
flew
up
into
the
air
and
away
to
the
north
and
alighted
farther
on
koko
followed
them
all
at
once
menie
heard
a
queer
little
sound
it
went
and
it
sounded
very
near
nip
and
tup
sniffed
and
began
to
growl
and
nose
around
on
the
ice
menie
knew
what
the
queer
noise
meant
for
his
father
had
told
him
all
about
seal
hunting
it
meant
that
a
was
near
and
that
a
seal
had
come
up
to
breathe
it
was
the
seal
that
made
the
plopping
noise
menie
tried
to
keep
the
dogs
still
but
they
would
be
kept
still
they
ran
round
with
their
noses
on
the
snow
giving
little
anxious
whines
and
short
sharp
barks
the
stopped
the
seal
had
gone
down
under
the
ice
but
menie
meant
to
find
the
hole
he
went
out
quite
near
the
open
water
in
his
search
at
last
just
beyond
a
hummock
of
ice
he
saw
it
he
crept
carefully
up
to
it
he
lay
down
on
his
stomach
and
peeped
into
the
hole
to
see
what
it
was
like
he
could
not
see
a
thing
then
he
stuck
his
lance
down
his
lance
touched
something
soft
that
wiggled
menie
stood
up
he
was
so
excited
that
he
trembled
he
knew
he
had
found
a
with
a
live
seal
in
the
snow
house
with
all
his
strength
he
struck
his
lance
down
through
the
snow
the
snow
house
fell
in
and
menie
fell
with
it
but
he
kept
hold
of
his
lance
the
end
of
the
lance
was
buried
in
the
snow
but
it
was
moving
menie
knew
by
this
that
he
had
stuck
it
into
the
seal
he
lay
still
and
kept
fast
hold
of
his
lance
and
pressed
down
on
it
with
all
his
might
nip
and
tup
were
crazy
with
excitement
they
jumped
round
and
barked
and
tried
to
dig
a
hole
in
the
snow
with
their
forefeet
at
last
the
spear
stopped
wiggling
then
menie
carefully
dug
the
snow
away
there
lay
a
little
white
seal
it
was
too
young
to
swim
away
with
its
mother
that
was
why
such
a
small
boy
as
menie
had
been
able
to
kill
it
he
dragged
it
out
on
the
ice
he
was
so
excited
and
so
busy
he
did
not
notice
how
near
he
was
to
the
open
water
iv
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
loud
cracking
noise
and
menie
felt
the
ice
moving
under
him
he
looked
back
there
was
a
tiny
strip
of
blue
water
between
him
and
the
shore
the
strip
grew
wider
while
he
looked
at
it
menie
knew
that
he
was
adrift
on
an
ice
raft
and
he
was
terribly
frightened
nip
and
tup
cuddled
close
to
him
and
whined
with
fear
menie
understood
perfectly
well
that
he
might
be
carried
far
out
to
sea
and
never
come
back
any
more
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
yelled
with
all
his
might
koko
was
still
following
the
birds
and
did
not
hear
menie
cries
menie
could
see
him
running
up
the
beach
after
the
birds
and
he
could
see
his
father
working
over
his
kyak
near
his
home
he
even
saw
monnie
come
out
of
the
tunnel
and
go
to
watch
her
father
at
his
work
they
seemed
very
far
away
and
every
moment
the
distance
between
them
and
the
raft
grew
greater
menie
screamed
again
and
again
at
the
third
scream
he
saw
his
father
straighten
up
shade
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
look
out
to
sea
oh
menie
thought
what
if
he
should
see
me
he
shouted
louder
than
ever
he
waved
his
arms
he
even
pinched
the
tails
of
nip
and
tup
and
made
them
bark
then
he
saw
his
father
wave
his
hand
and
dive
into
the
tunnel
in
another
instant
he
was
out
again
and
pulling
on
his
skin
coat
then
he
took
the
kyak
on
his
shoulders
and
ran
with
it
to
the
beach
monnie
and
koolee
came
running
after
him
they
were
doing
the
screaming
now
every
one
in
the
village
heard
the
screams
and
came
running
down
to
the
beach
too
when
menie
saw
his
father
coming
with
the
kyak
he
was
afraid
any
more
for
he
was
sure
his
father
would
save
him
he
was
even
afraid
about
the
cakes
of
ice
that
were
floating
in
the
water
though
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
to
go
out
in
a
kyak
among
ice
floes
one
bump
from
a
floating
cake
of
ice
is
enough
to
upset
any
boat
and
i
do
like
to
think
of
what
might
happen
if
a
kyak
should
get
between
two
big
cakes
of
ice
kesshoo
ran
with
his
kyak
as
far
as
he
could
on
the
ice
then
he
got
in
and
fitted
the
bottom
of
his
skin
jacket
over
the
kyak
hole
and
carefully
slid
himself
into
the
open
water
once
in
the
water
how
his
paddle
flew
it
seemed
to
menie
as
if
his
father
would
never
reach
him
he
sat
very
still
on
the
ice
pan
with
the
dead
seal
beside
him
and
nip
and
tup
huddled
up
against
him
at
last
kesshoo
came
near
enough
so
he
could
make
menie
hear
everything
he
said
menie
he
cried
if
you
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
i
can
save
you
i
will
throw
you
my
harpoon
you
must
drive
it
way
down
into
the
ice
then
by
the
harpoon
line
i
will
tow
your
ice
pan
back
toward
shore
when
we
get
to
the
big
ice
i
will
find
a
place
for
you
to
land
you
must
be
ready
and
when
i
give
the
word
jump
from
your
ice
raft
on
to
the
solid
ice
then
kesshoo
threw
his
harpoon
and
menie
drove
it
into
the
ice
with
all
his
might
slowly
kesshoo
drew
the
line
taut
turned
his
kyak
round
and
started
for
the
shore
the
journey
out
had
been
dangerous
but
the
journey
back
was
much
more
so
for
kesshoo
could
not
dodge
the
floating
ice
nearly
so
well
he
had
to
pick
his
way
carefully
through
the
clearest
water
he
could
find
very
cautiously
they
moved
toward
shore
they
were
getting
quite
near
the
place
where
the
ice
had
broken
with
menie
when
suddenly
right
near
them
they
saw
the
head
and
great
round
eyes
of
a
seal
it
was
the
seal
mother
she
had
come
back
to
find
her
breathing
hole
and
her
baby
the
moment
kesshoo
saw
her
he
seized
his
dart
which
lay
in
its
place
on
top
of
his
kyak
and
threw
it
with
all
his
might
at
the
seal
the
seal
dived
down
into
the
sea
but
a
bladder
full
of
air
was
attached
to
the
line
on
the
dart
and
this
bladder
floated
on
the
water
so
kesshoo
could
tell
by
watching
it
just
where
the
seal
was
kesshoo
knew
he
had
struck
the
seal
and
although
he
was
already
towing
the
ice
raft
he
was
determined
to
bring
home
the
big
seal
too
he
called
to
menie
sit
still
and
wait
until
i
come
for
you
then
he
quickly
cut
the
harpoon
line
by
which
he
was
towing
the
ice
raft
and
set
it
adrift
again
as
soon
as
he
was
free
he
paddled
away
after
the
bladder
which
was
now
bobbing
along
over
the
water
at
some
little
distance
from
the
boat
menie
sat
perfectly
still
and
watched
his
father
kesshoo
reached
the
bladder
and
began
to
pull
on
the
line
but
just
at
that
moment
the
big
seal
turned
round
and
swam
right
under
the
kyak
in
a
second
the
kyak
turned
bottom
side
up
in
the
water
menie
screamed
the
people
watching
on
the
shore
gave
a
great
howl
and
koko
father
started
up
the
beach
after
his
own
kyak
he
thought
perhaps
kesshoo
could
not
manage
both
the
ice
raft
and
the
seal
and
he
meant
to
go
to
help
him
but
in
one
second
kesshoo
was
right
side
up
again
no
water
could
get
into
the
kyak
because
kesshoo
skin
coat
was
drawn
tight
over
the
hole
in
the
deck
and
kesshoo
was
in
the
coat
kesshoo
often
turned
somersaults
in
the
water
in
that
way
sometimes
he
even
did
it
for
fun
he
said
afterward
that
he
could
have
turned
the
boat
right
side
up
again
with
just
his
nose
without
using
either
his
paddle
or
his
arms
if
only
his
nose
had
been
a
little
bigger
and
though
he
meant
this
for
a
joke
the
twins
believed
that
he
really
could
do
it
the
moment
he
was
right
side
up
again
kesshoo
gave
chase
once
more
to
the
bladder
the
seal
was
very
weak
now
and
kesshoo
knew
that
it
would
soon
come
to
the
surface
and
float
and
that
then
he
could
tow
it
in
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
bladder
bobbed
about
for
a
while
and
then
was
still
kesshoo
drew
up
the
line
and
paddled
back
to
the
ice
raft
towing
the
big
seal
after
him
catch
this
he
said
to
menie
he
threw
him
the
end
of
the
line
wind
the
line
six
times
round
the
harpoon
he
said
and
hold
tight
to
the
end
of
it
menie
did
as
he
was
told
then
kesshoo
tied
together
the
two
ends
of
the
harpoon
line
which
he
had
cut
and
began
to
tow
the
ice
raft
back
to
share
again
menie
kept
tight
hold
of
the
other
line
and
towed
the
seal
kesshoo
paddled
slowly
and
carefully
along
until
at
last
there
was
only
a
little
strip
of
water
between
the
kyak
and
the
solid
ice
but
how
in
the
world
could
menie
get
across
that
strip
of
water
to
safety
the
kyak
was
between
him
and
the
solid
ice
and
menie
could
not
possibly
get
into
the
kyak
neither
could
he
swim
but
kesshoo
knew
a
way
he
came
up
closer
to
the
solid
ice
then
he
gave
a
great
sweep
with
his
paddle
and
lifted
his
kyak
right
up
on
to
it
he
sprang
out
and
seizing
the
harpoon
line
pulled
menie
raft
close
up
to
the
edge
of
the
firm
ice
menie
was
still
holding
tight
to
the
line
that
held
the
big
seal
kesshoo
threw
him
another
line
menie
caught
the
end
of
it
now
tie
the
big
seal
line
fast
to
that
kesshoo
said
menie
was
a
very
small
boy
but
he
knew
how
to
tie
knots
he
did
just
what
his
father
told
him
to
now
said
his
father
pull
up
the
harpoon
menie
did
so
tie
the
harpoon
line
to
the
little
seal
menie
did
that
now
throw
the
harpoon
to
me
commanded
kesshoo
menie
threw
it
with
all
his
might
his
father
caught
it
and
stood
on
the
firm
ice
holding
in
his
hands
the
line
that
the
big
seal
was
tied
to
and
the
harpoon
with
its
line
fastened
to
the
little
seal
now
hold
on
to
the
little
seal
and
i
will
pull
you
right
up
against
the
solid
ice
and
when
i
say
you
jump
said
kesshoo
slowly
and
very
carefully
he
pulled
until
the
raft
grated
against
the
solid
ice
jump
shouted
kesshoo
menie
jumped
the
ice
raft
gave
a
lurch
that
nearly
sent
him
into
the
water
but
kesshoo
caught
him
and
pulled
him
to
safety
a
great
shout
of
joy
went
up
from
the
shore
and
menie
was
glad
enough
to
shout
too
when
he
felt
solid
ice
under
his
feet
once
more
while
he
helped
his
father
pull
in
the
little
seal
all
the
people
came
running
out
on
to
the
ice
to
meet
them
but
kesshoo
sent
back
every
one
except
koko
father
he
was
afraid
the
ice
might
break
again
with
so
many
people
on
it
koko
father
helped
pull
the
big
seal
out
of
the
water
and
over
the
ice
to
the
beach
menie
dragged
his
own
little
seal
after
him
by
the
harpoon
line
and
when
he
came
near
the
beach
the
people
all
cried
out
see
the
great
hunter
with
his
game
and
koolee
was
so
glad
to
see
menie
and
so
proud
of
her
boy
that
she
nearly
burst
with
joy
i
knew
the
charm
would
work
she
cried
not
only
does
he
spy
bears
he
kills
seals
and
he
only
five
years
old
she
put
her
arms
around
him
and
pressed
her
flat
nose
to
his
the
eskimo
way
of
kissing
menie
tried
to
look
as
if
he
killed
seals
and
got
carried
away
on
an
ice
pan
every
day
in
the
week
but
inside
he
felt
very
proud
too
when
kesshoo
and
koko
father
came
up
with
the
big
seal
koolee
and
the
other
women
dragged
it
to
the
village
where
it
was
skinned
and
cut
up
every
one
had
a
piece
of
raw
blubber
to
eat
at
once
and
the
very
first
piece
went
to
menie
while
they
were
eating
it
koko
came
back
he
had
gone
so
far
up
the
shore
hunting
little
auks
that
he
had
seen
a
thing
that
had
happened
and
he
had
killed
any
little
auks
either
koko
felt
that
things
were
very
unequally
divided
in
this
world
he
wanted
to
kill
a
seal
and
get
lost
on
a
raft
and
be
a
hero
too
but
koolee
gave
him
a
large
piece
of
blubber
and
that
made
him
feel
much
more
cheerful
again
he
just
said
to
monnie
if
i
had
been
with
menie
this
never
would
have
happened
i
should
not
have
let
him
get
so
near
the
edge
of
the
ice
but
then
you
know
i
am
six
and
he
is
only
five
so
of
course
he
did
know
any
better
everybody
in
the
village
had
seal
meat
that
night
and
the
angakok
had
the
head
which
they
all
thought
was
the
best
part
he
said
he
feel
very
well
and
his
tornak
had
told
him
nothing
would
cure
him
so
quickly
as
a
seal
head
so
koolee
gave
it
to
him
the
skin
of
the
little
white
seal
koolee
saved
and
dressed
very
carefully
she
chewed
it
all
over
on
the
wrong
side
and
sucked
out
all
the
blubber
and
made
it
soft
and
fine
as
velvet
and
when
that
was
done
she
made
out
of
it
two
beautiful
pairs
of
white
mittens
for
the
twins
viii
the
the
i
during
the
long
dark
hours
of
the
winter
kesshoo
found
many
pleasant
things
to
do
at
home
he
was
always
busy
he
carved
a
doll
for
monnie
out
of
the
ivory
tusk
of
a
walrus
monnie
named
the
doll
annadore
and
she
loved
it
dearly
koolee
dressed
annadore
in
fur
with
tiny
kamiks
of
sealskin
and
monnie
carried
her
doll
in
her
hood
just
the
way
koko
mother
carried
her
baby
for
menie
his
father
made
dog
harnesses
out
of
walrus
hide
he
made
them
just
the
right
size
for
nip
and
tup
menie
harnessed
the
little
dogs
to
his
sled
then
he
and
monnie
would
play
sledge
journeys
annadore
would
sit
on
the
sled
all
wrapped
in
furs
while
menie
drove
the
dogs
and
monnie
followed
after
nip
and
tup
did
not
like
this
play
very
well
and
they
did
always
go
where
they
were
told
to
once
they
dashed
right
over
the
igloo
and
spilled
annadore
off
annadore
rolled
down
one
side
of
the
igloo
while
nip
and
tup
galloped
down
the
other
annadore
was
buried
in
the
snow
and
had
to
be
dug
out
so
it
was
quite
a
serious
accident
you
see
but
nip
and
tup
did
not
seem
to
feel
at
all
responsible
about
it
kesshoo
made
knives
and
queer
spoons
out
of
bone
or
ivory
for
koolee
and
for
himself
he
made
new
barbs
for
his
new
bone
hooks
for
fishlines
and
all
sorts
of
things
for
hunting
he
made
salmon
spears
and
bird
darts
and
fishlines
and
he
ornamented
his
weapons
with
little
pictures
or
patterns
he
carved
two
frogs
on
the
handle
of
his
snow
knife
and
scratched
the
picture
of
a
walrus
on
the
blade
sometimes
koolee
carved
things
too
but
most
of
the
time
she
was
busy
making
coats
or
kamiks
or
chewing
skins
to
make
them
soft
and
fine
for
use
in
the
igloo
or
to
cover
the
kyaks
or
to
make
their
summer
tent
once
during
the
winter
the
whole
family
went
thirty
miles
up
the
coast
by
moonlight
to
visit
koolee
brother
in
another
village
they
went
with
the
dog
sledge
and
it
took
them
two
days
they
had
meat
and
blubber
with
them
and
plenty
of
warm
skins
and
when
they
got
tired
kesshoo
made
a
snow
house
for
them
to
rest
in
the
twins
thought
this
was
the
best
fun
of
all
ii
when
spring
came
on
there
were
other
things
to
do
as
the
days
grew
longer
the
ice
in
the
bay
cracked
and
broke
into
small
pieces
and
floated
away
the
water
turned
deep
blue
and
danced
in
the
sunlight
and
ice
floated
about
in
it
often
there
were
walrus
on
these
the
twins
sometimes
saw
their
huge
black
bodies
on
the
white
ice
and
heard
their
hoarse
barks
then
all
the
men
in
the
village
would
rush
for
their
kyaks
and
set
out
after
the
walrus
the
men
were
brave
and
enjoyed
the
dangerous
sport
but
the
women
used
to
watch
anxiously
until
they
saw
the
kyaks
coming
home
towing
the
walrus
behind
them
then
they
would
rush
down
to
the
shore
help
pull
the
kyaks
up
on
the
beach
where
they
cut
the
walrus
in
pieces
and
divided
it
among
the
families
of
the
hunters
when
the
snow
had
melted
on
the
big
rock
hundreds
of
made
their
nests
there
and
filled
the
air
with
their
cries
sometimes
kesshoo
went
egg
hunting
on
the
cliff
and
sometimes
he
set
traps
there
for
foxes
and
he
helped
menie
and
koko
make
a
little
trap
to
catch
hares
there
was
plenty
to
do
in
every
season
of
the
year
at
last
the
nights
shortened
to
nothing
at
all
the
long
day
had
begun
the
stone
but
which
they
had
found
so
comfortable
in
winter
seemed
dark
and
damp
now
menie
and
monnie
remembered
the
summer
days
when
they
did
not
have
to
dive
down
through
a
hole
to
get
into
their
house
so
menie
said
to
monnie
one
day
let
go
and
ask
father
if
it
is
time
to
put
up
the
tents
they
ran
out
to
find
him
he
was
down
on
the
beach
talking
with
father
and
the
other
men
of
the
village
on
the
beach
were
two
very
long
boats
the
men
were
looking
them
over
carefully
to
see
if
they
were
water
tight
koko
was
with
the
men
when
he
saw
the
twins
coming
he
tore
up
the
slope
to
meet
them
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
they
getting
out
the
they
getting
out
the
this
was
glorious
news
to
the
twins
they
ran
down
to
the
beach
with
koko
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
they
got
there
just
in
time
to
hear
koko
father
say
to
kesshoo

pretty
well
out
of
the
bay
and
the
reindeer

be
coming
down
to
the

listened
to
hear
what
kesshoo
would
say
and
the
twins
listened
too
with
all
their
ears
if
it
clear
i
think

they
pulled

and
monnie
some
time
to
go

for
they
could
look
straight
up
through
the
roof
at
the
sky
and
the
sky
was
bright
and
blue
with
little
white
clouds
sailing
over
it
besides
they
were
thinking
about
the
wonderful
things
that

happen
when

should
wake
up
ix
the
voyage
the
voyage
i
when
the

cried
koolee
she
laughed
at
them

she
said
she
reached
her
arm
down
the
hole
and
pulled
out
all
the
skins
from
the
bed
as
fast
as
the
twins
gave
them
to
her
then
she
put
her
head
down
into
the
opening
and
looked
all
around
we
have
left
a
thing
she
said
come
along
the
twins
could
climb
out
through
the
roof
though
they
wanted
to
so
they
went
out
by
the
tunnel
and
helped
their
mother
carry
the
skins
to
the
beach
all
the
people
in
the
village
and
all
the
dogs
were
there
before
them
the
great

packed
the
kyaks
of
the
men
waited
beside
them
in
a
row
on
the
beach
with
their
noses
in
the
water
the
dogs
barked
and
raced
up
and
down
the
beach
the
babies
crowed
and
the
children
shouted
for
joy
even
the
grown
people
were
gay
they
talked
in
loud
tones
and
laughed
and
made
jokes
ii
at
last
kesshoo
shouted
all
ready
in
you
go
he
told
each
person
where
to
sit
he
put
the
angakok
in
one
boat
to
steer
he
put
koko

in
the

koolee
and
the
twins
the
pups
all
three
dogs
and
four
of
the
women
who
lived
in
the
other
igloos
so
you
see
it
was
quite
a
large
boat
in
the
angakok
boat
he
placed
his
two
wives
and
all
the
rest
of
the
women
and
children
and
dogs
the
women
took
up
the
paddles
one
end
of
the
boat
was
partly
in
the
water
when
they
got
in
the
men
gently
pushed
it
farther
out
until
it
floated
then
the
men
got
into
their
kyaks
at
the
water
edge
fastened
their
skin
coats
over
the
rims
and
paddled
out
into
deep
water
at
last
when
all
the
boats
big
and
little
were
afloat
kesshoo
called
out
we
are
going
north
follow
me
the
women
obeyed
the
signal
of
koko
father
and
the
angakok
the
paddles
dipped
together
into
the
water
the
great
boats
moved
they
were
off
the
children
all
sat
together
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
but
the
twins
and
koko
were
big
enough
to
see
over
the
sides
while
the
babies
played
with
the
dogs
they
were
busy
watching
the
things
that
passed
on
the
shores
soon
they
passed
the
big
rock
with
little
auks
and
puffins
flying
about
it
they
could
see
the
red
feet
of
the
puffins
and
a
blue
fox
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
rock
waiting
for
a
chance
to
catch
a
bird
then
the
big
rock
hid
the
village
from
sight
iii
beyond
the
big
rock
the
country
was
all
new
to
the
twins
and
koko
they
looked
into
narrow
bays
and
inlets
as
the
boat
moved
along
and
saw
green
moss
carpeting
the
sunny
slopes
in
sheltered
places
they
could
even
see
bright
flowers
growing
in
the
warm
spots
which
faced
the
sun
the
sky
was
blue
overhead
the
water
was
blue
below
beyond
the
green
slopes
they
could
see
the
bare
hillsides
crowned
with
the
white
ice
cap
which
never
melts
and
streams
of
water
dashing
down
the
hillsides
and
pouring
themselves
into
the
waters
of
the
bay
when
they
had
gone
a
good
many
miles
up
the
coast
kesshoo
waved
his
hand
and
pointed
to
a
strange
sight
on
the
shore
there
was
a
great
river
of
ice
they
could
see
where
it
came
out
of
a
hollow
place
between
two
hills
it
looked
just
like
a
river
only
it
was
frozen
solid
and
the
end
of
it
where
it
came
into
the
sea
was
broken
off
like
a
great
wall
of
ice
and
there
were
cakes
of
ice
floating
about
in
the
water
suddenly
there
was
a
cracking
sound
menie
had
heard
that
sound
before
it
was
the
same
sound
that
he
had
heard
when
he
went
hunting
and
got
carried
away
on
the
ice
raft
menie
did
like
the
sound
anymore
it
scared
him
right
after
the
cracking
noise
kesshoo
voice
shouted
row
farther
out
follow
me
he
turned
his
kyak
straight
out
to
sea
all
the
other
boats
followed
they
had
gone
only
about
half
a
mile
when
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
as
if
a
piece
of
the
world
had
broken
off
and
then
there
was
a
splash
that
could
be
heard
for
miles
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
hear
it
the
end
of
the
glacier
or
ice
river
had
broken
off
and
fallen
down
into
the
water
it
had
made
an
iceberg
the
splash
was
so
great
that
in
a
moment
the
waves
it
made
reached
the
boats
the
boats
rocked
up
and
down
on
the
water
and
bounced
about
like
corks
the
twins
and
koko
thought
this
was
great
fun
but
the
angakok
like
it
a
bit
one
wave
splashed
over
him
and
some
of
the
water
went
down
his
neck
all
the
grown
people
knew
that
if
they
had
rowed
quickly
away
from
shore
when
kesshoo
called
they
might
have
been
upset
and
drowned
iv
when
the
waves
made
by
the
iceberg
had
calmed
down
again
kesshoo
paddled
round
among
the
boats
he
said
i
think
we
better
land
about
a
mile
above
here
there
a
stream
there
and
perhaps
we
can
get
some
salmon
for
our
dinner
he
led
the
way
in
his
kyak
and
all
the
other
boats
followed
they
kept
out
of
the
path
of
the
iceberg
which
had
already
floated
some
distance
from
the
shore
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
to
a
little
inlet
kesshoo
paddled
into
it
and
up
to
the
very
end
of
it
where
a
beautiful
stream
of
clear
water
came
dashing
down
over
the
rocks
into
the
sea
the
hills
sloped
suddenly
down
to
the
shore
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
green
slopes
and
the
high
cliffs
behind
shut
off
the
cold
north
winds
it
was
a
little
piece
of
summer
set
right
down
in
the
valley
oh
how
beautiful
everybody
cried
the
boats
were
soon
drawn
up
on
the
beach
the
women
and
children
tumbled
out
and
then
began
preparations
for
dinner
the
women
got
out
their
cooking
pots
and
koolee
set
to
work
to
make
a
fireplace
out
of
three
stones
they
had
blubber
and
moss
with
them
but
how
could
they
get
a
fire
they
had
no
matches
they
had
never
even
heard
of
a
match
the
angakok
sat
down
on
the
beach
he
had
some
little
pieces
of
dry
driftwood
and
some
dried
moss
he
held
one
end
of
a
piece
of
driftwood
in
a
sort
of
handle
which
he
pressed
against
his
lips
the
other
end
was
in
a
hollow
spot
in
another
piece
of
wood
the
angakok
rolled
one
driftwood
stick
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
spot
of
the
other
he
did
this
by
means
of
a
bow
which
he
pulled
from
one
side
to
the
other
this
made
the
stick
whirl
first
one
way
then
back
again
soon
a
little
smoke
came
curling
up
round
the
stick
koolee
dropped
some
dried
moss
on
the
smoking
spot
suddenly
there
was
a
little
blaze
she
fed
the
little
flame
with
more
moss
and
then
lighted
the
moss
on
the
stones
of
the
fireplace
she
put
a
soapstone
kettle
filled
with
water
over
the
fire
and
soon
the
kettle
was
boiling
while
all
this
was
going
on
down
on
the
beach
the
men
took
their
salmon
spears
and
went
up
the
river
and
koko
and
the
twins
went
with
them
the
wives
of
the
angakok
went
to
find
moss
to
feed
the
fire
they
brought
back
great
armfuls
of
it
and
put
it
beside
the
fireplace
koolee
was
the
cook
she
stayed
on
the
beach
and
looked
after
the
babies
and
the
dogs
and
the
fire
everything
was
ready
for
dinner
except
the
food
meanwhile
the
men
had
found
a
good
place
where
there
were
big
stones
in
the
river
they
stood
on
these
stones
with
their
spears
in
their
hands
there
were
hundreds
of
salmon
in
the
little
stream
the
salmon
were
going
up
to
the
little
lake
from
which
the
river
flowed
when
the
fish
leaped
in
the
water
the
men
struck
at
them
with
their
fish
spears
there
were
so
many
fish
and
the
men
were
so
skillful
that
they
soon
had
plenty
for
dinner
they
strung
them
all
on
a
walrus
line
and
went
back
to
the
beach
koolee
popped
as
many
as
she
could
into
her
pot
to
cook
but
the
men
were
so
hungry
they
ate
theirs
raw
and
the
twins
and
koko
had
as
many
fishes
eyes
to
eat
as
they
wanted
for
once
in
their
lives
when
everybody
had
eaten
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
hold
the
babies
were
rolled
up
in
furs
in
the
sand
and
went
to
sleep
the
angakok
lay
down
on
the
sand
in
the
sunshine
with
his
hands
over
his
stomach
and
was
soon
asleep
too
the
men
sat
in
a
little
group
near
by
and
menie
and
koko
lay
on
their
stomachs
beside
kesshoo
the
women
had
gone
a
little
farther
up
the
beach
the
air
was
still
except
for
the
rippling
sound
of
the
water
the
distant
chatter
of
the
women
the
snores
of
the
angakok
and
the
buzzing
of
mosquitoes
for
quite
a
long
time
everybody
rested
menie
and
koko
did
go
to
sleep
they
were
having
too
much
fun
they
played
with
shells
and
pebbles
and
watched
the
mosquitoes
buzzing
over
the
angakok
face
there
were
a
great
many
mosquitoes
and
they
seemed
to
like
the
angakok
at
last
one
settled
on
his
nose
and
bit
and
bit
menie
and
koko
wanted
to
slap
it
but
of
course
they
did
dare
they
just
had
to
let
it
bite
all
of
a
sudden
the
angakok
woke
up
and
slapped
it
himself
he
slapped
it
harder
than
he
intended
to
he
looked
very
much
surprised
and
quite
offended
about
it
he
sat
up
and
looked
round
for
his
wives
as
if
he
thought
perhaps
they
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
they
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
beach
the
angakok
yawned
and
rubbed
his
nose
which
was
a
good
deal
swollen
just
then
kesshoo
spoke
i
think
we
shall
look
a
long
time
before
we
find
a
better
spot
than
this
to
camp
he
said
here
are
plenty
of
salmon
we
can
catch
all
we
need
to
dry
for
winter
use
right
here
there
must
be
deer
farther
up
the
fiord
what
do
you
say
to
setting
up
the
tents
right
here
when
kesshoo
said
anything
the
others
were
pretty
sure
to
agree
because
kesshoo
was
such
a
brave
and
skillful
man
that
they
trusted
his
judgment
all
the
men
said
yes
let
us
stay
then
the
angakok
said
yes
my
children
let
us
stay
while
you
thought
i
was
asleep
here
on
the
sand
i
was
really
in
a
trance
i
thought
it
best
to
ask
my
tornak
about
this
spot
and
whether
we
should
be
threatened
here
by
any
hidden
danger
my
tornak
says
to
stay
this
settled
the
matter
tell
the
women
said
kesshoo
koko
father
went
over
to
the
place
where
the
women
and
children
were
get
out
the
tent
poles
he
called
to
them
here
where
we
stay
the
women
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
they
got
out
the
long
narwhal
tusks
and
the
skins
and
set
them
down
on
the
beach
come
with
me
koolee
called
to
the
twins
she
gave
them
each
a
long
tent
pole
to
carry
she
herself
carried
the
longest
pole
of
all
and
a
pile
of
skins
koolee
led
the
way
up
the
green
slope
to
a
level
spot
overlooking
the
stream
and
the
bay
it
was
beside
some
high
rocks
and
there
were
smaller
stones
all
about
there
was
a
flat
stone
that
she
used
for
the
sleeping
bench
when
the
poles
were
set
up
and
securely
fastened
she
got
the
tent
skins
and
covered
the
poles
she
put
on
one
layer
of
skin
with
the
hair
inside
and
over
that
another
covering
of
skin
with
the
fur
side
out
she
sewed
the
skins
together
over
the
entrance
with
leather
thongs
and
left
a
flap
for
a
door
then
she
placed
stones
around
the
edge
of
the
tent
covering
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
it
away
she
piled
the
bed
skins
on
the
rock
and
their
summer
house
was
ready
the
twins
brought
the
hides
with
all
their
treasures
in
them
and
the
cooking
pots
and
knives
and
household
things
from
the
beach
while
koolee
made
the
fireplace
in
the
tent
she
made
the
fireplace
by
driving
four
sticks
into
the
ground
and
lashing
them
together
to
make
a
framework
she
hung
the
cooking
kettle
by
straps
from
the
four
corners
under
the
kettle
on
a
flat
stone
she
placed
the
lamp
then
the
stove
was
ready
we
shall
cook
out
of
doors
most
of
the
time
she
said
to
the
twins
but
in
rainy
weather
we
shall
need
the
lamp
it
was
only
a
little
while
before
there
was
a
whole
new
village
ready
to
live
in
with
plenty
of
fish
and
good
fresh
water
right
at
hand
vi
menie
and
monnie
were
happy
in
their
new
home
they
climbed
about
on
the
rock
and
found
a
beautiful
cave
to
play
in
they
gathered
flowers
and
shells
and
colored
stones
and
brought
them
to
their
mother
then
later
they
went
for
more
fish
with
the
men
and
kesshoo
let
them
stand
on
the
stones
and
try
to
spear
the
fish
just
the
way
the
men
did
menie
caught
one
and
koko
caught
one
but
monnie
had
no
luck
at
all
anyway
i
caught
a
codfish
once
monnie
said
to
comfort
herself
in
two
hours
everything
was
as
settled
about
the
camp
as
if
they
had
lived
there
a
week
and
every
one
was
hungry
again
hungriness
and
sleepiness
came
just
as
regularly
as
if
they
had
had
nights
and
clocks
both
to
measure
time
by
when
the
food
was
ready
kesshoo
called
ujo
ujo
which
meant
boiled
meat
and
everybody
came
running
to
the
beach
the
men
sat
in
one
circle
the
women
and
children
in
another
pots
of
boiled
fish
were
set
in
the
middle
of
the
circles
and
they
all
dipped
in
with
their
fingers
and
took
what
they
wanted
when
everybody
had
eaten
the
children
played
on
the
beach
they
skipped
stones
and
danced
and
played
ball
and
their
mothers
played
with
them
the
men
had
their
fun
too
they
sat
in
their
circle
told
stories
and
played
games
which
were
children
games
and
the
angakok
sang
a
song
beating
time
on
a
little
drum
all
the
men
sang
the
chorus
by
and
by
koolee
saw
monnie
head
nodding
so
she
said
to
the
twins
come
children
let
go
up
to
the
tent
she
took
their
hands
and
led
them
up
the
slope
we
not
sleepy
the
twins
declared
i
am
said
koolee
and
i
want
you
with
me
they
went
into
the
tent
which
was
not
so
light
as
it
was
out
of
doors
in
the
bright
sunlight
then
they
undressed
crawled
in
among
the
deerskins
and
were
soon
sound
asleep
all
three
of
them
after
a
while
kesshoo
came
up
from
the
beach
and
went
to
sleep
too
x
the
summer
day
the
summer
day
i
the
summer
days
flew
by
only
one
really
should
say
days
at
all
but
summer
day
for
three
whole
bright
months
it
was
just
one
daylight
picnic
all
the
time
the
people
ate
when
they
were
hungry
and
slept
when
they
were
sleepy
the
men
caught
hundreds
of
salmon
and
the
women
split
them
open
and
dried
them
on
the
rocks
for
winter
use
the
children
played
all
day
long
the
men
hunted
deer
and
and
bears
up
in
the
hills
and
brought
them
back
to
camp
they
hunted
game
both
by
land
and
by
sea
there
was
so
much
to
eat
that
everybody
grew
fatter
and
as
for
the
angakok
he
got
so
very
fat
that
koko
said
to
menie
i
do
believe
we
can
ever
get
the
angakok
home
in
the
he
so
heavy
he
sink
it
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
tie
a
string
to
him
and
tow
him
back
like
a
walrus
yes
said
menie
maybe
he
would
shrink
some
if
we
soaked
him
well
do
you
know
how
water
shrinks
the
walrus
hide
cords
that
we
tie
around
things
when
we
want
them
to
hold
tight
together
it
was
lucky
for
menie
and
koko
that
nobody
heard
them
say
that
about
the
angakok
it
would
have
been
thought
very
disrespectful
when
the
game
grew
scarce
or
they
got
tired
of
camping
in
one
spot
everything
was
piled
into
their
boats
again
and
away
they
went
up
the
coast
until
they
found
another
place
they
liked
better
then
they
would
set
up
their
tents
again
sometimes
they
came
to
other
camps
and
had
a
good
time
meeting
new
people
and
making
new
friends
at
last
late
in
august
the
sun
slipped
down
below
the
edge
of
the
world
again
it
stayed
just
long
enough
to
fill
the
sky
with
wonderful
red
and
gold
sunset
clouds
then
it
came
up
again
the
next
night
there
was
a
little
time
between
the
sunset
sky
and
the
lovely
colors
of
the
sunrise
the
next
night
was
longer
still
each
day
grew
colder
and
colder
still
the
people
lingered
in
their
tents
they
did
not
like
to
think
the
pleasant
summer
was
over
and
the
long
night
near
but
at
last
kesshoo
said
i
think
it
is
time
to
go
back
to
winter
quarters
the
nights
are
fast
growing
longer
the
snow
may
be
upon
us
any
day
now
i
do
know
of
a
better
place
to
settle
than
the
village
where
we
spent
last
winter
the
igloos
are
all
built
there
ready
to
use
again
what
do
you
say
shall
we
go
back
there
yes
let
us
go
back
they
all
said
ii
the
very
next
day
they
started
the
boats
were
heavily
loaded
with
dried
fish
there
were
great
piles
of
new
skins
heaped
in
the
and
every
kyak
towed
a
seal
for
days
they
traveled
along
the
coast
stopping
only
for
rest
and
food
the
twins
and
koko
sat
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
the
dogs
and
listened
to
the
regular
dip
of
the
paddles
to
the
cries
of
the
as
they
flew
away
toward
the
south
and
to
the
chatter
of
the
women
these
were
almost
the
only
sounds
they
heard
for
the
silence
of
the
great
white
world
was
all
about
them
they
talked
together
in
low
voices
and
planned
all
the
things
they
would
do
when
the
long
night
was
really
upon
them
once
more
when
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
the
big
rock
they
felt
as
if
they
had
reached
home
after
a
very
long
journey
koko
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
pointed
to
it
see
he
cried
the
big
rock
where
we
found
the
bear
yes
monnie
said
and
where
we
slid
downhill
and
i
see
where
i
got
caught
on
the
ice
raft
menie
shouted
sit
down
said
koko
mother
you
tip
the
boat
and
spill
us
all
into
the
water
koko
sat
down
the
boat
glided
along
through
the
water
nearer
and
nearer
until
at
last
they
came
round
the
big
rock
and
there
just
as
if
they
had
not
been
away
at
all
lay
the
whole
village
of
five
igloos
looking
as
if
it
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
sunshine
the
big
boats
waited
until
the
men
had
all
paddled
to
the
shore
and
beached
their
kyaks
then
they
were
drawn
carefully
up
on
to
the
sand
and
every
one
got
out
the
beach
at
once
became
a
very
busy
place
the
men
pulled
the
walruses
and
seals
out
of
the
water
and
took
care
of
the
boats
while
the
women
set
up
the
tents
cut
the
meat
into
big
pieces
for
storage
and
carried
all
their
belongings
to
the
tents
although
the
village
looked
just
the
same
other
things
looked
quite
different
nip
and
tup
were
big
dogs
by
this
time
they
ran
away
up
the
beach
with
tooky
and
the
other
dogs
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
boats
they
did
not
stay
with
the
twins
all
the
time
now
as
they
used
to
do
the
twins
were
much
bigger
too
koolee
looked
at
them
as
they
helped
her
carry
the
up
from
the
beach
and
said
to
them
my
goodness
i
must
make
my
needles
fly
winter
is
upon
us
and
your
clothes
are
getting
too
small
for
you
you
must
have
new
things
right
away
the
twins
thought
this
was
a
very
good
idea
they
liked
new
clothes
as
well
as
any
one
in
the
world
koolee
set
up
the
tent
beside
their
old
igloo
and
there
they
lived
while
the
men
of
the
village
went
out
every
day
in
their
kyaks
for
seal
and
walrus
or
back
into
the
hills
after
other
game
to
store
away
for
food
during
the
long
winter
the
women
scraped
and
cured
the
skins
and
cut
up
the
meat
and
packed
it
away
as
fast
as
the
men
could
kill
the
game
and
bring
it
home
each
day
it
grew
colder
and
each
night
was
longer
than
the
last
until
one
short
september
day
there
came
a
great
snow
storm
it
snowed
all
day
long
and
that
night
the
wind
blew
so
hard
that
koolee
and
the
twins
nearly
froze
even
among
the
fur
covers
of
their
bed
and
when
morning
came
they
found
themselves
nearly
buried
under
a
great
drift
that
very
day
koolee
put
the
stones
over
the
roof
of
the
igloo
once
more
and
the
twins
helped
her
fill
in
the
chinks
with
moss
and
earth
and
cover
it
with
a
heavy
layer
of
snow
patted
down
with
the
snow
shovel
until
everything
was
snug
and
tight
again
then
they
moved
in
by
the
next
day
all
the
igloos
in
the
village
were
in
use
and
when
night
came
their
windows
shone
with
the
light
of
the
lamps
just
as
they
had
so
many
months
before
nip
and
tup
slept
outside
with
tooky
now
in
a
snow
house
which
kesshoo
had
built
for
them
menie
and
monnie
missed
them
but
koolee
said
you
are
getting
so
big
now
you
must
begin
to
do
something
besides
play
with
puppies
monnie
must
learn
to
sew
and
menie
must
help
father
with
feeding
the
dogs
and
looking
after
their
harnesses
and
driving
the
sledge
maybe
father
will
teach
you
both
to
carve
fine
things
out
of
ivory
this
winter
monnie
will
soon
need
her
own
thimble
and
needles
they
must
be
made
and
she
can
help
me
clean
the
skins
and
suck
out
the
blubber
and
prepare
them
for
being
made
into
clothes
dear
me
what
a
lot
there
is
to
do
to
keep
clothes
on
our
backs
and
food
in
our
mouths
the
giants
are
always
waiting
before
the
igloo
and
we
must
work
very
hard
to
keep
them
outside
she
did
not
mean
real
giants
she
meant
that
hunger
and
want
are
always
waiting
to
seize
the
eskimo
who
does
not
work
all
the
time
to
supply
food
for
himself
and
his
family
she
meant
that
menie
must
learn
to
be
a
brave
strong
hunter
afraid
of
nothing
on
sea
or
land
and
that
monnie
must
learn
to
do
a
woman
work
well
or
else
the
time
would
come
when
they
would
be
without
food
or
shelter
or
clothing
and
the
fierce
cold
would
soon
make
an
end
of
them
it
was
lucky
they
got
into
the
warm
igloo
just
when
they
did
for
the
winter
had
come
to
stay
the
bay
froze
over
far
out
from
shore
and
the
white
snow
covered
the
igloos
so
completely
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
windows
and
for
people
moving
about
out
of
doors
no
one
could
have
told
that
there
was
any
village
there
the
last
day
of
all
was
so
short
that
menie
and
monnie
and
koko
saw
the
whole
of
it
from
the
top
of
the
big
rock
they
had
gone
up
there
in
the
gray
twilight
that
comes
before
the
sunrise
to
build
a
snow
house
to
play
in
they
had
been
there
only
a
little
while
when
the
sky
grew
all
rosy
just
over
the
edge
of
the
world
the
color
grew
stronger
and
stronger
until
the
little
stars
were
all
drowned
in
it
and
then
up
came
the
great
round
red
face
of
the
sun
itself
the
children
watched
it
as
it
peered
over
the
horizon
threw
long
blue
shadows
behind
them
across
the
snow
and
then
sank
slowly
slowly
down
again
leaving
only
the
flaming
colors
in
the
sky
to
mark
the
place
where
it
had
been
they
waved
their
hands
as
it
slipped
out
of
sight
good
bye
old
sun
they
shouted
and
good
bye
shadow
too
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
both
when
you
come
back
again
then
because
the
wind
blew
very
cold
and
they
could
see
a
snow
cloud
coming
toward
them
from
the
great
white
world
where
the
giants
lived
the
children
ran
together
down
the
snowy
slope
toward
the
bright
windows
of
their
homes
the
end
suggestions
to
teachers
to
arouse
the
children
interest
and
thus
to
make
the
reading
of
this
story
most
valuable
as
a
school
exercise
it
is
suggested
that
at
the
outset
the
children
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
book
in
order
to
get
acquainted
with
menie
and
monnie
and
with
the
scenes
illustrating
their
home
life
and
surroundings
during
the
reading
point
out
the
north
pole
greenland
on
a
map
of
the
world
or
on
a
globe
and
tell
the
children
something
about
the
many
years
of
effort
before
peary
succeeded
in
reaching
his
goal
also
about
the
work
of
subsequent
explorers
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
around
the
south
pole
as
well
thus
this
supplementary
reading
material
may
be
connected
with
the
work
in
geography
the
text
is
so
simply
written
that
the
second
grade
child
can
read
it
without
much
or
any
preparation
it
may
be
well
to
have
the
children
read
it
first
in
a
study
period
in
order
to
work
out
the
pronunciation
of
the
more
difficult
words
but
many
classes
will
be
able
to
read
it
at
sight
without
the
preparatory
study
the
possibilities
in
the
story
for
dramatization
and
for
language
and
constructive
work
will
be
immediately
apparent
in
connection
with
the
reading
of
the
book
teachers
should
tell
to
the
children
stories
describing
eskimo
life
and
the
experiences
of
explorers
and
pioneers
in
the
north
grenfell
adrift
on
an
is
suitable
for
example
holbrook
northland
heroes
and
sinopah
the
indian
boy
while
not
belonging
to
the
land
of
the
eskimos
contain
stories
of
allied
interest
let
the
children
bring
to
class
pictures
of
scenes
in
the
north
clipped
from
magazines
and
newspapers
the
unique
illustrations
in
the
eskimo
twins
should
be
much
used
both
in
the
reading
of
the
story
and
in
other
ways
children
will
enjoy
sketching
some
of
them
their
simple
treatment
makes
them
especially
useful
for
this
purpose
the
book
is
printed
on
paper
which
will
take
watercolor
well
and
where
the
books
are
individually
owned
some
of
the
sketches
could
be
used
for
coloring
in
flat
washes
they
also
afford
suggestions
for
action
sketching
by
the
children
an
excellent
oral
language
exercise
would
be
for
the
children
after
they
have
read
the
story
to
take
turns
telling
the
story
from
the
illustrations
and
a
good
composition
exercise
would
be
for
each
child
to
select
the
illustration
that
he
would
like
to
write
upon
make
a
sketch
of
it
and
write
the
story
in
his
own
words
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
ways
that
will
occur
to
resourceful
teachers
for
making
the
book
a
valuable
as
well
as
an
enjoyable
exercise
in
reading
