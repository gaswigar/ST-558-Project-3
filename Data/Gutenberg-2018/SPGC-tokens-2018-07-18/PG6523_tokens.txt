a
state
i
am
in
before
he
came
nothing
mattered
i
felt
so
free
but
now
that
he
has
come
goodness
knows
from
where
my
heart
is
filled
with
his
dear
self
and
my
home
will
be
no
home
to
me
when
he
leaves
doctor
do
you
think
he
physician
if
there
life
in
his
fate
then
he
will
live
long
but
what
the
medical
scriptures
say
it
seems
madhav
great
heavens
what
physician
the
scriptures
have
it
bile
or
palsey
cold
or
gout
spring
all
alike
madhav
oh
get
along
do
fling
your
scriptures
at
me
you
only
make
me
more
anxious
tell
me
what
i
can
do
physician
taking
snuff
the
patient
needs
the
most
scrupulous
care
madhav
that
true
but
tell
me
how
physician
i
have
already
mentioned
on
no
account
must
he
be
let
out
of
doors
madhav
poor
child
it
is
very
hard
to
keep
him
indoors
all
day
long
physician
what
else
can
you
do
the
autumn
sun
and
the
damp
are
both
very
bad
for
the
little
fellow
for
the
scriptures
have
it
in
wheezing
swoon
or
in
nervous
fret
in
jaundice
or
leaden
eyes
madhav
never
mind
the
scriptures
please
eh
then
we
must
shut
the
poor
thing
up

there
no
other
method
physician
none
at
all
for
in
the
wind
and
in
the
sun
madhav
what
will
your
in
this
and
in
that
do
for
me
now
why
do
you
let
them
alone
and
come
straight
to
the
point
to
be
done
then
your
system
is
very
very
hard
for
the
poor
boy
and
he
is
so
quiet
too
with
all
his
pain
and
sickness
it
tears
my
heart
to
see
him
wince
as
he
takes
your
medicine
physician
effect
that
why
the
sage
chyabana
observes
in
medicine
as
in
good
advices
the
least
palatable
ones
are
the
truest
ah
well
i
must
be
trotting
now
exit
gaffer
enters
madhav
well
i
jiggered
there
gaffer
now
gaffer
why
why
i
wo
bite
you
madhav
no
but
you
are
a
devil
to
send
children
off
their
heads
gaffer
but
you
are
a
child
and
you
no
child
in
the
house
why
worry
then
madhav
oh
but
i
have
brought
a
child
into
the
house
gaffer
indeed
how
so
madhav
you
remember
how
my
wife
was
dying
to
adopt
a
child
gaffer
yes
but
that
an
old
story
you
did
like
the
idea
madhav
you
know
brother
how
hard
all
this
getting
money
in
has
been
that
somebody
else
child
would
sail
in
and
waste
all
this
money
earned
with
so
much
trouble
oh
i
hated
the
idea
but
this
boy
clings
to
my
heart
in
such
a
queer
sort
of
way
gaffer
so
that
the
trouble
and
your
money
goes
all
for
him
and
feels
jolly
lucky
it
does
go
at
all
madhav
formerly
earning
was
a
sort
of
passion
with
me
i
simply
could
help
working
for
money
now
i
make
money
and
as
i
know
it
is
all
for
this
dear
boy
earning
becomes
a
joy
to
me
gaffer
ah
well
and
where
did
you
pick
him
up
madhav
he
is
the
son
of
a
man
who
was
a
brother
to
my
wife
by
village
ties
he
has
had
no
mother
since
infancy
and
now
the
other
day
he
lost
his
father
as
well
gaffer
poor
thing
and
so
he
needs
me
all
the
more
madhav
the
doctor
says
all
the
organs
of
his
little
body
are
at
loggerheads
with
each
other
and
there
is
much
hope
for
his
life
there
is
only
one
way
to
save
him
and
that
is
to
keep
him
out
of
this
autumn
wind
and
sun
but
you
are
such
a
terror
what
with
this
game
of
yours
at
your
age
too
to
get
children
out
of
doors
gaffer
god
bless
my
soul
so
i
already
as
bad
as
autumn
wind
and
sun
eh
but
friend
i
know
something
too
of
the
game
of
keeping
them
indoors
when
my
day
work
is
over
i
am
coming
in
to
make
friends
with
this
child
of
yours
exit
amal
enters
amal
uncle
i
say
uncle
madhav
hullo
is
that
you
amal
amal
may
i
be
out
of
the
courtyard
at
all
madhav
no
my
dear
no
amal
see
there
where
auntie
grinds
lentils
in
the
quirn
the
squirrel
is
sitting
with
his
tail
up
and
with
his
wee
hands
picking
up
the
broken
grains
of
lentils
and
crunching
them
ca
i
run
up
there
madhav
no
my
darling
no
amal
wish
i
were
a
squirrel
it
would
be
lovely
uncle
why
wo
you
let
me
go
about
madhav
doctor
says
it
bad
for
you
to
be
out
amal
how
can
the
doctor
know
madhav
what
a
thing
to
say
the
doctor
ca
know
and
he
reads
such
huge
books
amal
does
his
tell
him
everything
madhav
of
course
do
you
know
amal
with
a
sigh
ah
i
am
so
stupid
i
do
read
books
madhav
now
think
of
it
very
very
learned
people
are
all
like
you
they
are
never
out
of
doors
amal
are
they
really
madhav
no
how
can
they
early
and
late
they
toil
and
moil
at
their
books
and
they
eyes
for
nothing
else
now
my
little
man
you
are
going
to
be
learned
when
you
grow
up
and
then
you
will
stay
at
home
and
read
such
big
books
and
people
will
notice
you
and
say
he
a
wonder
amal
no
no
uncle
i
beg
of
you
by
your
dear
feet
i
want
to
be
learned
i
wo
madhav
dear
dear
it
would
have
been
my
saving
if
i
could
have
been
learned
amal
no
i
would
rather
go
about
and
see
everything
that
there
is
madhav
listen
to
that
see
what
will
you
see
what
is
there
so
much
to
see
amal
see
that
hill
from
our
window
i
often
long
to
go
beyond
those
hills
and
right
away
madhav
oh
you
silly
as
if
there
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
just
get
up
to
the
top
of
that
hill
and
away
eh
you
talk
sense
my
boy
now
listen
since
that
hill
stands
there
upright
as
a
barrier
it
means
you
ca
get
beyond
it
else
what
was
the
use
in
heaping
up
so
many
large
stones
to
make
such
a
big
affair
of
it
eh
amal
uncle
do
you
think
it
is
meant
to
prevent
your
crossing
over
it
seems
to
me
because
the
earth
ca
speak
it
raises
its
hands
into
the
sky
and
beckons
and
those
who
live
far
and
sit
alone
by
their
windows
can
see
the
signal
but
i
suppose
the
learned
people
madhav
no
they
do
have
time
for
that
sort
of
nonsense
they
are
not
crazy
like
you
amal
do
you
know
yesterday
i
met
someone
quite
as
crazy
as
i
am
madhav
gracious
me
really
how
so
amal
he
had
a
bamboo
staff
on
his
shoulder
with
a
small
bundle
at
the
top
and
a
brass
pot
in
his
left
hand
and
an
old
pair
of
shoes
on
he
was
making
for
those
hills
straight
across
that
meadow
there
i
called
out
to
him
and
asked
where
are
you
going
he
answered
i
do
know
anywhere
i
asked
again
why
are
you
going
he
said
i
going
out
to
seek
work
say
uncle
have
you
to
seek
work
madhav
of
course
i
have
to
there
many
about
looking
for
jobs
amal
how
lovely
i
go
about
like
them
too
finding
things
to
do
madhav
suppose
you
seek
and
do
find
then
amal
would
that
be
jolly
then
i
should
go
farther
i
watched
that
man
slowly
walking
on
with
his
pair
of
worn
out
shoes
and
when
he
got
to
where
the
water
flows
under
the
fig
tree
he
stopped
and
washed
his
feet
in
the
stream
then
he
took
out
from
his
bundle
some
moistened
it
with
water
and
began
to
eat
then
he
tied
up
his
bundle
and
shouldered
it
again
tucked
up
his
cloth
above
his
knees
and
crossed
the
stream
i
asked
auntie
to
let
me
go
up
to
the
stream
and
eat
my
just
like
him
madhav
and
what
did
your
auntie
say
to
that
amal
auntie
said
get
well
and
then
i
take
you
over
there
please
uncle
when
shall
i
get
well
madhav
it
wo
be
long
dear
amal
really
but

simply
sing
and
they
fly
amal
how
glorious
and
it
by

it
on
the
sea
amal
and
green
hills

glow
on

a
man
quite
a
trifling
creature
without
wings
and
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with

pass
my
days
counting
the
sea
waves

feed
me
with
warm
milk
with
foam
on
it
from
a
brand

it
all
there
the
king
postman
coming
down
the
hillside
alone
a
lantern
in
his
left
hand
and
on
his
back
a
bag
of
letters
climbing
down
for
ever
so
long
for
days
and
nights
and
where
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
waterfall
becomes
a
stream
he
takes
to
the
footpath
on
the
bank
and
walks
on
through
the
rye
then
comes
the
sugarcane
field
and
he
disappears
into
the
narrow
lane
cutting
through
the
tall
stems
of
sugarcanes
then
he
reaches
the
open
meadow
where
the
cricket
chirps
and
where
there
is
not
a
single
man
to
be
seen
only
the
snipe
wagging
their
tails
and
poking
at
the
mud
with
their
bills
i
can
feel
him
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
my
heart
becomes
glad
gaffer
my
eyes
are
young
but
you
make
me
see
all
the
same
amal
say
fakir
do
you
know
the
king
who
has
this
post
office
gaffer
i
do
i
go
to
him
for
my
alms
every
day
amal
good
when
i
get
well
i
must
have
my
alms
too
from
him

i
gaffer

wo
need
to
ask
my
dear
he
give
it
to
you
of
his
own
accord
amal
no
i
would
go
to
his
gate
and
cry
victory
to
thee
o
king
and
dancing
to
the
tabor
sound
ask
for
alms
wo
it
be
nice
gaffer
it
would
be
splendid
and
if
you
with
me
i
shall
have
my
full
share
but
what
you
ask
amal
i
shall
say
make
me
your
postman
that

may
go
about

in

for
my
child
even
were
you
to
stay
at

amal
it
is
sad
when
they
shut
me
in
here
first
i

the
day

so
long
since
the
king
post
office
i
like
it
more
and
more
being
indoors
and

letter
one
day
i
feel
quite
happy
and

and
alone
i
wonder
if
i
shall
make
out
what
be
in
the
king
letter
gaffer
even
if
you
did
would
it
be
enough
if

idea
of
the
trouble
you
got
me
into
between
you
