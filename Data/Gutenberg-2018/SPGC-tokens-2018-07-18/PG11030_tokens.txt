preface
by
the

reader
be
assured
this
narrative
is
no
fiction
i
am
aware
that
some
of
my
adventures
may
seem
incredible
but
they
are
nevertheless
strictly
true
i
have
not
exaggerated
the
wrongs
inflicted
by
slavery
on
the
contrary
my
descriptions
fall
far
short
of
the
facts
i
have
concealed
the
names
of
places
and
given
persons
fictitious
names
i
had
no
motive
for
secrecy
on
my
own
account
but
i
deemed
it
kind
and
considerate
towards
others
to
pursue
this
course
i
wish
i
were
more
competent
to
the
task
i
have
undertaken
but
i
trust
my
readers
will
excuse
deficiencies
in
consideration
of
circumstances
i
was
born
and
reared
in
slavery
and
i
remained
in
a
slave
state
years
since
i
have
been
at
the
north
it
has
been
necessary
for
me
to
work
diligently
for
my
own
support
and
the
education
of
my
children
this
has
not
left
me
much
leisure
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
early
opportunities
to
improve
myself
and
it
has
compelled
me
to
write
these
pages
at
irregular
intervals
whenever
i
could
snatch
an
hour
from
household
duties
when
i
first
arrived
in
philadelphia
bishop
paine
advised
me
to
publish
a
sketch
of
my
life
but
i
told
him
i
was
altogether
incompetent
to
such
an
undertaking
though
i
have
improved
my
mind
somewhat
since
that
time
i
still
remain
of
the
same
opinion
but
i
trust
my
motives
will
excuse
what
might
otherwise
seem
presumptuous
i
have
not
written
my
experiences
in
order
to
attract
attention
to
myself
on
the
contrary
it
would
have
been
more
pleasant
to
me
to
have
been
silent
about
my
own
history
neither
do
i
care
to
excite
sympathy
for
my
own
sufferings
but
i
do
earnestly
desire
to
arouse
the
women
of
the
north
to
a
realizing
sense
of
the
condition
of
two
millions
of
women
at
the
south
still
in
bondage
suffering
what
i
suffered
and
most
of
them
far
worse
i
want
to
add
my
testimony
to
that
of
abler
pens
to
convince
the
people
of
the
free
states
what
slavery
really
is
only
by
experience
can
any
one
realize
how
deep
and
dark
and
foul
is
that
pit
of
abominations
may
the
blessing
of
god
rest
on
this
imperfect
effort
in
behalf
of
my
persecuted
people
introduction
by
the
editor
the
author
of
the
following
autobiography
is
personally
known
to
me
and
her
conversation
and
manners
inspire
me
with
confidence
during
the
last
seventeen
years
she
has
lived
the
greater
part
of
the
time
with
a
distinguished
family
in
new
york
and
has
so
deported
herself
as
to
be
highly
esteemed
by
them
this
fact
is
sufficient
without
further
credentials
of
her
character
i
believe
those
who
know
her
will
not
be
disposed
to
doubt
her
veracity
though
some
incidents
in
her
story
are
more
romantic
than
fiction
at
her
request
i
have
revised
her
manuscript
but
such
changes
as
i
have
made
have
been
mainly
for
purposes
of
condensation
and
orderly
arrangement
i
have
not
added
any
thing
to
the
incidents
or
changed
the
import
of
her
very
pertinent
remarks
with
trifling
exceptions
both
the
ideas
and
the
language
are
her
own
i
pruned
excrescences
a
little
but
otherwise
i
had
no
reason
for
changing
her
lively
and
dramatic
way
of
telling
her
own
story
the
names
of
both
persons
and
places
are
known
to
me
but
for
good
reasons
i
suppress
them
it
will
naturally
excite
surprise
that
a
woman
reared
in
slavery
should
be
able
to
write
so
well
but
circumstances
will
explain
this
in
the
first
place
nature
endowed
her
with
quick
perceptions
secondly
the
mistress
with
whom
she
lived
till
she
was
twelve
years
old
was
a
kind
considerate
friend
who
taught
her
to
read
and
spell
thirdly
she
was
placed
in
favorable
circumstances
after
she
came
to
the
north
having
frequent
intercourse
with
intelligent
persons
who
felt
a
friendly
interest
in
her
welfare
and
were
disposed
to
give
her
opportunities
for
i
am
well
aware
that
many
will
accuse
me
of
indecorum
for
presenting
these
pages
to
the
public
for
the
experiences
of
this
intelligent
and
woman
belong
to
a
class
which
some
call
delicate
subjects
and
others
indelicate
this
peculiar
phase
of
slavery
has
generally
been
kept
veiled
but
the
public
ought
to
be
made
acquainted
with
its
monstrous
features
and
i
willingly
take
the
responsibility
of
presenting
them
with
the
veil
withdrawn
i
do
this
for
the
sake
of
my
sisters
in
bondage
who
are
suffering
wrongs
so
foul
that
our
ears
are
too
delicate
to
listen
to
them
i
do
it
with
the
hope
of
arousing
conscientious
and
reflecting
women
at
the
north
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
in
the
exertion
of
moral
influence
on
the
question
of
slavery
on
all
possible
occasions
i
do
it
with
the
hope
that
every
man
who
reads
this
narrative
will
swear
solemnly
before
god
that
so
far
as
he
has
power
to
prevent
it
no
fugitive
from
slavery
shall
ever
be
sent
back

suffer

incidents
in
the
life
of
a
slave
girl
seven
years
concealed
childhood
i
was
born
a
slave
but
i
never
knew
it
till
six
years
of
happy
childhood
had
passed
away
my
father
was
a
carpenter
and
considered
so
intelligent
and
skilful
in
his
trade
that
when
buildings
out
of
the
common
line
were
to
be
erected
he
was
sent
for
from
long
distances
to
be
head
workman
on
condition
of
paying
his
mistress
two
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
supporting
himself
he
was
allowed
to
work
at
his
trade
and
manage
his
own
affairs
his
strongest
wish
was
to
purchase
his
children
but
though
he
several
times
offered
his
hard
earnings
for
that
purpose
he
never
succeeded
in
complexion
my
parents
were
a
light
shade
of
brownish
yellow
and
were
termed
mulattoes
they
lived
together
in
a
comfortable
home
and
though
we
were
all
slaves
i
was
so
fondly
shielded
that
i
never
dreamed
i
was
a
piece
of
merchandise
trusted
to
them
for
safe
keeping
and
liable
to
be
demanded
of
them
at
any
moment
i
had
one
brother
william
who
was
two
years
younger
than
myself
a
bright
affectionate
child
i
had
also
a
great
treasure
in
my
maternal
grandmother
who
was
a
remarkable
woman
in
many
respects
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
planter
in
south
carolina
who
at
his
death
left
her
mother
and
his
three
children
free
with
money
to
go
to
augustine
where
they
had
relatives
it
was
during
the
revolutionary
war
and
they
were
captured
on
their
passage
carried
back
and
sold
to
different
purchasers
such
was
the
story
my
grandmother
used
to
tell
me
but
i
do
not
remember
all
the
particulars
she
was
a
little
girl
when
she
was
captured
and
sold
to
the
keeper
of
a
large
hotel
i
have
often
heard
her
tell
how
hard
she
fared
during
childhood
but
as
she
grew
older
she
evinced
so
much
intelligence
and
was
so
faithful
that
her
master
and
mistress
could
not
help
seeing
it
was
for
their
interest
to
take
care
of
such
a
valuable
piece
of
property
she
became
an
indispensable
personage
in
the
household
officiating
in
all
capacities
from
cook
and
wet
nurse
to
seamstress
she
was
much
praised
for
her
cooking
and
her
nice
crackers
became
so
famous
in
the
neighborhood
that
many
people
were
desirous
of
obtaining
them
in
consequence
of
numerous
requests
of
this
kind
she
asked
permission
of
her
mistress
to
bake
crackers
at
night
after
all
the
household
work
was
done
and
she
obtained
leave
to
do
it
provided
she
would
clothe
herself
and
her
children
from
the
profits
upon
these
terms
after
working
hard
all
day
for
her
mistress
she
began
her
midnight
bakings
assisted
by
her
two
oldest
children
the
business
proved
profitable
and
each
year
she
laid
by
a
little
which
was
saved
for
a
fund
to
purchase
her
children
her
master
died
and
the
property
was
divided
among
his
heirs
the
widow
had
her
dower
in
the
hotel
which
she
continued
to
keep
open
my
grandmother
remained
in
her
service
as
a
slave
but
her
children
were
divided
among
her
master
children
as
she
had
five
benjamin
the
youngest
one
was
sold
in
order
that
each
heir
might
have
an
equal
portion
of
dollars
and
cents
there
was
so
little
difference
in
our
ages
that
he
seemed
more
like
my
brother
than
my
uncle
he
was
a
bright
handsome
lad
nearly
white
for
he
inherited
the
complexion
my
grandmother
had
derived
from
ancestors
though
only
ten
years
old
seven
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
were
paid
for
him
his
sale
was
a
terrible
blow
to
my
grandmother
but
she
was
naturally
hopeful
and
she
went
to
work
with
renewed
energy
trusting
in
time
to
be
able
to
purchase
some
of
her
children
she
had
laid
up
three
hundred
dollars
which
her
mistress
one
day
begged
as
a
loan
promising
to
pay
her
soon
the
reader
probably
knows
that
no
promise
or
writing
given
to
a
slave
is
legally
binding
for
according
to
southern
laws
a
slave
property
can
no
property
when
my
grandmother
lent
her
hard
earnings
to
her
mistress
she
trusted
solely
to
her
honor
the
honor
of
a
slaveholder
to
a
slave
to
this
good
grandmother
i
was
indebted
for
many
comforts
my
brother
willie
and
i
often
received
portions
of
the
crackers
cakes
and
preserves
she
made
to
sell
and
after
we
ceased
to
be
children
we
were
indebted
to
her
for
many
more
important
services
such
were
the
unusually
fortunate
circumstances
of
my
early
childhood
when
i
was
six
years
old
my
mother
died
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
learned
by
the
talk
around
me
that
i
was
a
slave
my
mother
mistress
was
the
daughter
of
my
grandmother
mistress
she
was
the
foster
sister
of
my
mother
they
were
both
nourished
at
my
grandmother
breast
in
fact
my
mother
had
been
weaned
at
three
months
old
that
the
babe
of
the
mistress
might
obtain
sufficient
food
they
played
together
as
children
and
when
they
became
women
my
mother
was
a
most
faithful
servant
to
her
whiter
foster
sister
on
her
her
mistress
promised
that
her
children
should
never
suffer
for
any
thing
and
during
her
lifetime
she
kept
her
word
they
all
spoke
kindly
of
my
dead
mother
who
had
been
a
slave
merely
in
name
but
in
nature
was
noble
and
womanly
i
grieved
for
her
and
my
young
mind
was
troubled
with
the
thought
who
would
now
take
care
of
me
and
my
little
brother
i
was
told
that
my
home
was
now
to
be
with
her
mistress
and
i
found
it
a
happy
one
no
toilsome
or
disagreeable
duties
were
imposed
on
me
my
mistress
was
so
kind
to
me
that
i
was
always
glad
to
do
her
bidding
and
proud
to
labor
for
her
as
much
as
my
young
years
would
permit
i
would
sit
by
her
side
for
hours
sewing
diligently
with
a
heart
as
free
from
care
as
that
of
any
white
child
when
she
thought
i
was
tired
she
would
send
me
out
to
run
and
jump
and
away
i
bounded
to
gather
berries
or
flowers
to
decorate
her
room
those
were
happy
days
too
happy
to
last
the
slave
child
had
no
thought
for
the
morrow
but
there
came
that
blight
which
too
surely
waits
on
every
human
being
born
to
be
a
chattel
when
i
was
nearly
twelve
years
old
my
kind
mistress
sickened
and
died
as
i
saw
the
cheek
grow
paler
and
the
eye
more
glassy
how
earnestly
i
prayed
in
my
heart
that
she
might
live
i
loved
her
for
she
had
been
almost
like
a
mother
to
me
my
prayers
were
not
answered
she
died
and
they
buried
her
in
the
little
churchyard
where
day
after
day
my
tears
fell
upon
her
grave
i
was
sent
to
spend
a
week
with
my
grandmother
i
was
now
old
enough
to
begin
to
think
of
the
future
and
again
and
again
i
asked
myself
what
they
would
do
with
me
i
felt
sure
i
should
never
find
another
mistress
so
kind
as
the
one
who
was
gone
she
had
promised
my
dying
mother
that
her
children
should
never
suffer
for
any
thing
and
when
i
remembered
that
and
recalled
her
many
proofs
of
attachment
to
me
i
could
not
help
having
some
hopes
that
she
had
left
me
free
my
friends
were
almost
certain
it
would
be
so
they
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
do
it
on
account
of
my
mother
love
and
faithful
service
but
alas
we
all
know
that
the
memory
of
a
faithful
slave
does
not
avail
much
to
save
her
children
from
the
auction
block
after
a
brief
period
of
suspense
the
will
of
my
mistress
was
read
and
we
learned
that
she
had
bequeathed
me
to
her
sister
daughter
a
child
of
five
years
old
so
vanished
our
hopes
my
mistress
had
taught
me
the
precepts
of
god
word
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
unto
you
do
ye
even
so
unto
them
but
i
was
her
slave
and
i
suppose
she
did
not
recognize
me
as
her
neighbor
i
would
give
much
to
blot
out
from
my
memory
that
one
great
wrong
as
a
child
i
loved
my
mistress
and
looking
back
on
the
happy
days
i
spent
with
her
i
try
to
think
with
less
bitterness
of
this
act
of
injustice
while
i
was
with
her
she
taught
me
to
read
and
spell
and
for
this
privilege
which
so
rarely
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
slave
i
bless
her
memory
she
possessed
but
few
slaves
and
at
her
death
those
were
all
distributed
among
her
relatives
five
of
them
were
my
grandmother
children
and
had
shared
the
same
milk
that
nourished
her
mother
children
notwithstanding
my
grandmother
long
and
faithful
service
to
her
owners
not
one
of
her
children
escaped
the
auction
block
these
machines
are
no
more
in
the
sight
of
their
masters
than
the
cotton
they
plant
or
the
horses
they
tend
ii
the
new
master
and
mistress
flint
a
physician
in
the
neighborhood
had
married
the
sister
of
my
mistress
and
i
was
now
the
property
of
their
little
daughter
it
was
not
without
murmuring
that
i
prepared
for
my
new
home
and
what
added
to
my
unhappiness
was
the
fact
that
my
brother
william
was
purchased
by
the
same
family
my
father
by
his
nature
as
well
as
by
the
habit
of
transacting
business
as
a
skillful
mechanic
had
more
of
the
feelings
of
a
freeman
than
is
common
among
slaves
my
brother
was
a
spirited
boy
and
being
brought
up
under
such
influences
he
daily
detested
the
name
of
master
and
mistress
one
day
when
his
father
and
his
mistress
both
happened
to
call
him
at
the
same
time
he
hesitated
between
the
two
being
perplexed
to
know
which
had
the
strongest
claim
upon
his
obedience
he
finally
concluded
to
go
to
his
mistress
when
my
father
reproved
him
for
it
he
said
you
both
called
me
and
i
did
know
which
i
ought
to
go
to
first
you
are
child
replied
our
father
and
when
i
call
you
you
should
come
immediately
if
you
have
to
pass
through
fire
and
water
poor
willie
he
was
now
to
learn
his
first
lesson
of
obedience
to
a
master
grandmother
tried
to
cheer
us
with
hopeful
words
and
they
found
an
echo
in
the
credulous
hearts
of
youth
when
we
entered
our
new
home
we
encountered
cold
looks
cold
words
and
cold
treatment
we
were
glad
when
the
night
came
on
my
narrow
bed
i
moaned
and
wept
i
felt
so
desolate
and
alone
i
had
been
there
nearly
a
year
when
a
dear
little
friend
of
mine
was
buried
i
heard
her
mother
sob
as
the
clods
fell
on
the
coffin
of
her
only
child
and
i
turned
away
from
the
grave
feeling
thankful
that
i
still
had
something
left
to
love
i
met
my
grandmother
who
said
come
with
me
linda
and
from
her
tone
i
knew
that
something
sad
had
happened
she
led
me
apart
from
the
people
and
then
said
my
child
your
father
is
dead
dead
how
could
i
believe
it
he
had
died
so
suddenly
i
had
not
even
heard
that
he
was
sick
i
went
home
with
my
grandmother
my
heart
rebelled
against
god
who
had
taken
from
me
mother
father
mistress
and
friend
the
good
grandmother
tried
to
comfort
me
who
knows
the
ways
of
god
said
she
perhaps
they
have
been
kindly
taken
from
the
evil
days
to
come
years
afterwards
i
often
thought
of
this
she
promised
to
be
a
mother
to
her
grandchildren
so
far
as
she
might
be
permitted
to
do
so
and
strengthened
by
her
love
i
returned
to
my
master
i
thought
i
should
be
allowed
to
go
to
my
father
house
the
next
morning
but
i
was
ordered
to
go
for
flowers
that
my
mistress
house
might
be
decorated
for
an
evening
party
i
spent
the
day
gathering
flowers
and
weaving
them
into
festoons
while
the
dead
body
of
my
father
was
lying
within
a
mile
of
me
what
cared
my
owners
for
that
he
was
merely
a
piece
of
property
moreover
they
thought
he
had
spoiled
his
children
by
teaching
them
to
feel
that
they
were
human
beings
this
was
blasphemous
doctrine
for
a
slave
to
teach
presumptuous
in
him
and
dangerous
to
the
masters
the
next
day
i
followed
his
remains
to
a
humble
grave
beside
that
of
my
dear
mother
there
were
those
who
knew
my
father
worth
and
respected
his
memory
my
home
now
seemed
more
dreary
than
ever
the
laugh
of
the
little
sounded
harsh
and
cruel
it
was
selfish
to
feel
so
about
the
joy
of
others
my
brother
moved
about
with
a
very
grave
face
i
tried
to
comfort
him
by
saying
take
courage
willie
brighter
days
will
come
by
and
by
you
do
know
any
thing
about
it
linda
he
replied
we
shall
have
to
stay
here
all
our
days
we
shall
never
be
free
i
argued
that
we
were
growing
older
and
stronger
and
that
perhaps
we
might
before
long
be
allowed
to
hire
our
own
time
and
then
we
could
earn
money
to
buy
our
freedom
william
declared
this
was
much
easier
to
say
than
to
do
moreover
he
did
not
intend
to
his
freedom
we
held
daily
controversies
upon
this
subject
little
attention
was
paid
to
the
slaves
meals
in
flint
house
if
they
could
catch
a
bit
of
food
while
it
was
going
well
and
good
i
gave
myself
no
trouble
on
that
score
for
on
my
various
errands
i
passed
my
grandmother
house
where
there
was
always
something
to
spare
for
me
i
was
frequently
threatened
with
punishment
if
i
stopped
there
and
my
grandmother
to
avoid
detaining
me
often
stood
at
the
gate
with
something
for
my
breakfast
or
dinner
i
was
indebted
to
for
all
my
comforts
spiritual
or
temporal
it
was
labor
that
supplied
my
scanty
wardrobe
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
dress
given
me
every
winter
by
flint
how
i
hated
it
it
was
one
of
the
badges
of
slavery
while
my
grandmother
was
thus
helping
to
support
me
from
her
hard
earnings
the
three
hundred
dollars
she
had
lent
her
mistress
were
never
repaid
when
her
mistress
died
her
flint
was
appointed
executor
when
grandmother
applied
to
him
for
payment
he
said
the
estate
was
insolvent
and
the
law
prohibited
payment
it
did
not
however
prohibit
him
from
retaining
the
silver
candelabra
which
had
been
purchased
with
that
money
i
presume
they
will
be
handed
down
in
the
family
from
generation
to
generation
my
grandmother
mistress
had
always
promised
her
that
at
her
death
she
should
be
free
and
it
was
said
that
in
her
will
she
made
good
the
promise
but
when
the
estate
was
settled
flint
told
the
faithful
old
servant
that
under
existing
circumstances
it
was
necessary
she
should
be
sold
on
the
appointed
day
the
customary
advertisement
was
posted
up
proclaiming
that
there
would
be
a
public
sale
of
negroes
horses
flint
called
to
tell
my
grandmother
that
he
was
unwilling
to
wound
her
feelings
by
putting
her
up
at
auction
and
that
he
would
prefer
to
dispose
of
her
at
private
sale
my
grandmother
saw
through
his
hypocrisy
she
understood
very
well
that
he
was
ashamed
of
the
job
she
was
a
very
spirited
woman
and
if
he
was
base
enough
to
sell
her
when
her
mistress
intended
she
should
be
free
she
was
determined
the
public
should
know
it
she
had
for
a
long
time
supplied
many
families
with
crackers
and
preserves
consequently
aunt
marthy
as
she
was
called
was
generally
known
and
every
body
who
knew
her
respected
her
intelligence
and
good
character
her
long
and
faithful
service
in
the
family
was
also
well
known
and
the
intention
of
her
mistress
to
leave
her
free
when
the
day
of
sale
came
she
took
her
place
among
the
chattels
and
at
the
first
call
she
sprang
upon
the
many
voices
called
out
shame
shame
who
is
going
to
sell
aunt
marthy
do
stand
there
that
is
no
place
for
without
saying
a
word
she
quietly
awaited
her
fate
no
one
bid
for
her
at
last
a
feeble
voice
said
fifty
dollars
it
came
from
a
maiden
lady
seventy
years
old
the
sister
of
my
grandmother
deceased
mistress
she
had
lived
forty
years
under
the
same
roof
with
my
grandmother
she
knew
how
faithfully
she
had
served
her
owners
and
how
cruelly
she
had
been
defrauded
of
her
rights
and
she
resolved
to
protect
her
the
auctioneer
waited
for
a
higher
bid
but
her
wishes
were
respected
no
one
bid
above
her
she
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
when
the
bill
of
sale
was
made
out
she
signed
it
with
a
cross
but
what
consequence
was
that
when
she
had
a
big
heart
overflowing
with
human
kindness
she
gave
the
old
servant
her
freedom
at
that
time
my
grandmother
was
just
fifty
years
old
laborious
years
had
passed
since
then
and
now
my
brother
and
i
were
slaves
to
the
man
who
had
defrauded
her
of
her
money
and
tried
to
defraud
her
of
her
freedom
one
of
my
mother
sisters
called
aunt
nancy
was
also
a
slave
in
his
family
she
was
a
kind
good
aunt
to
me
and
supplied
the
place
of
both
housekeeper
and
waiting
maid
to
her
mistress
she
was
in
fact
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
every
thing
flint
like
many
southern
women
was
totally
deficient
in
energy
she
had
not
strength
to
superintend
her
household
affairs
but
her
nerves
were
so
strong
that
she
could
sit
in
her
easy
chair
and
see
a
woman
whipped
till
the
blood
trickled
from
every
stroke
of
the
lash
she
was
a
member
of
the
church
but
partaking
of
the
lord
supper
did
not
seem
to
put
her
in
a
christian
frame
of
mind
if
dinner
was
not
served
at
the
exact
time
on
that
particular
sunday
she
would
station
herself
in
the
kitchen
and
wait
till
it
was
dished
and
then
spit
in
all
the
kettles
and
pans
that
had
been
used
for
cooking
she
did
this
to
prevent
the
cook
and
her
children
from
eking
out
their
meagre
fare
with
the
remains
of
the
gravy
and
other
scrapings
the
slaves
could
get
nothing
to
eat
except
what
she
chose
to
give
them
provisions
were
weighed
out
by
the
pound
and
ounce
three
times
a
day
i
can
assure
you
she
gave
them
no
chance
to
eat
wheat
bread
from
her
flour
barrel
she
knew
how
many
biscuits
a
quart
of
flour
would
make
and
exactly
what
size
they
ought
to
be
flint
was
an
epicure
the
cook
never
sent
a
dinner
to
his
table
without
fear
and
trembling
for
if
there
happened
to
be
a
dish
not
to
his
liking
he
would
either
order
her
to
be
whipped
or
compel
her
to
eat
every
mouthful
of
it
in
his
presence
the
poor
hungry
creature
might
not
have
objected
to
eating
it
but
she
did
object
to
having
her
master
cram
it
down
her
throat
till
she
choked
they
had
a
pet
dog
that
was
a
nuisance
in
the
house
the
cook
was
ordered
to
make
some
indian
mush
for
him
he
refused
to
eat
and
when
his
head
was
held
over
it
the
froth
flowed
from
his
mouth
into
the
basin
he
died
a
few
minutes
after
when
flint
came
in
he
said
the
mush
had
not
been
well
cooked
and
that
was
the
reason
the
animal
would
not
eat
it
he
sent
for
the
cook
and
compelled
her
to
eat
it
he
thought
that
the
woman
stomach
was
stronger
than
the
dog
but
her
sufferings
afterwards
proved
that
he
was
mistaken
this
poor
woman
endured
many
cruelties
from
her
master
and
mistress
sometimes
she
was
locked
up
away
from
her
nursing
baby
for
a
whole
day
and
night
when
i
had
been
in
the
family
a
few
weeks
one
of
the
plantation
slaves
was
brought
to
town
by
order
of
his
master
it
was
near
night
when
he
arrived
and
flint
ordered
him
to
be
taken
to
the
work
house
and
tied
up
to
the
joist
so
that
his
feet
would
just
escape
the
ground
in
that
situation
he
was
to
wait
till
the
doctor
had
taken
his
tea
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
never
before
in
my
life
had
i
heard
hundreds
of
blows
fall
in
succession
on
a
human
being
his
piteous
groans
and
his
o
pray
do
massa
rang
in
my
ear
for
months
afterwards
there
were
many
conjectures
as
to
the
cause
of
this
terrible
punishment
some
said
master
accused
him
of
stealing
corn
others
said
the
slave
had
quarrelled
with
his
wife
in
presence
of
the
overseer
and
had
accused
his
master
of
being
the
father
of
her
child
they
were
both
black
and
the
child
was
very
fair
i
went
into
the
work
house
next
morning
and
saw
the
cowhide
still
wet
with
blood
and
the
boards
all
covered
with
gore
the
poor
man
lived
and
continued
to
quarrel
with
his
wife
a
few
months
afterwards
flint
handed
them
both
over
to
a
the
guilty
man
put
their
value
into
his
pocket
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
they
were
out
of
sight
and
hearing
when
the
mother
was
delivered
into
the
trader
hands
she
said
you
to
treat
me
well
to
which
he
replied
you
have
let
your
tongue
run
too
far
damn
you
she
had
forgotten
that
it
was
a
crime
for
a
slave
to
tell
who
was
the
father
of
her
child
from
others
than
the
master
persecution
also
comes
in
such
cases
i
once
saw
a
young
slave
girl
dying
soon
after
the
birth
of
a
child
nearly
white
in
her
agony
she
cried
out
o
lord
come
and
take
me
her
mistress
stood
by
and
mocked
at
her
like
an
incarnate
fiend
you
suffer
do
you
she
exclaimed
i
am
glad
of
it
you
deserve
it
all
and
more
too
the
girl
mother
said
the
baby
is
dead
thank
god
and
i
hope
my
poor
child
will
soon
be
in
heaven
too
heaven
retorted
the
mistress
there
is
no
such
place
for
the
like
of
her
and
her
bastard
the
poor
mother
turned
away
sobbing
her
dying
daughter
called
her
feebly
and
as
she
bent
over
her
i
heard
her
say
do
grieve
so
mother
god
knows
all
about
it
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
me
her
sufferings
afterwards
became
so
intense
that
her
mistress
felt
unable
to
stay
but
when
she
left
the
room
the
scornful
smile
was
still
on
her
lips
seven
children
called
her
mother
the
poor
black
woman
had
but
the
one
child
whose
eyes
she
saw
closing
in
death
while
she
thanked
god
for
taking
her
away
from
the
greater
bitterness
of
life
iii
the
slaves
new
year
day
flint
owned
a
fine
residence
in
town
several
farms
and
about
fifty
slaves
besides
hiring
a
number
by
the
year
at
the
south
takes
place
on
the
of
january
on
the
the
slaves
are
expected
to
go
to
their
new
masters
on
a
farm
they
work
until
the
corn
and
cotton
are
laid
they
then
have
two
holidays
some
masters
give
them
a
good
dinner
under
the
trees
this
over
they
work
until
christmas
eve
if
no
heavy
charges
are
meantime
brought
against
them
they
are
given
four
or
five
holidays
whichever
the
master
or
overseer
may
think
proper
then
comes
new
year
eve
and
they
gather
together
their
little
alls
or
more
properly
speaking
their
little
nothings
and
wait
anxiously
for
the
dawning
of
day
at
the
appointed
hour
the
grounds
are
thronged
with
men
women
and
children
waiting
like
criminals
to
hear
their
doom
pronounced
the
slave
is
sure
to
know
who
is
the
most
humane
or
cruel
master
within
forty
miles
of
him
it
is
easy
to
find
out
on
that
day
who
clothes
and
feeds
his
slaves
well
for
he
is
surrounded
by
a
crowd
begging
please
massa
hire
me
this
year
i
will
work
hard
massa
if
a
slave
is
unwilling
to
go
with
his
new
master
he
is
whipped
or
locked
up
in
jail
until
he
consents
to
go
and
promises
not
to
run
away
during
the
year
should
he
chance
to
change
his
mind
thinking
it
justifiable
to
violate
an
extorted
promise
woe
unto
him
if
he
is
caught
the
whip
is
used
till
the
blood
flows
at
his
feet
and
his
stiffened
limbs
are
put
in
chains
to
be
dragged
in
the
field
for
days
and
days
if
he
lives
until
the
next
year
perhaps
the
same
man
will
hire
him
again
without
even
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
going
to
the
after
those
for
hire
are
disposed
of

she
wish
that
she
and
they
might
die
before
the
day
dawns
she
may
be
an
ignorant
creature
degraded
by
the
system
that
has
brutalized
her
from
childhood
but
she
has
a
instincts
and
is
capable
of
feeling
a
mother
agonies
on
one
of
these
sale
days
i
saw
a
mother
lead
seven
children
to
the
she
knew
that
of
them
would
be
taken
from
her
but
they
took
the
children
were
sold
to
a
and
their
mother
was
bought
by
a
man
in
her
own
town
before
night
her
children
were
all
far
away
she
begged
the
trader
to
tell
her
where
he
intended
to
take
them
this
he
refused
to
do
how
he
when
he
knew
he
would
sell
them
one
by
one
wherever
he
could
command
the
highest
price
i
met
that
mother
in
the
street
and
her
wild
haggard
face
lives
in
my
mind
she
wrung
her
hands
in
anguish
and
exclaimed
gone
all
gone
why
god
kill
me
i
had
no
words
wherewith
to
comfort
her
instances
of
this
kind
are
of
daily
yea
of
hourly
occurrence
slaveholders
have
a
method
peculiar
to
their
institution
of
getting
rid
of
slaves
whose
lives
have
been
worn
out
in
their
service
i
knew
an
old
woman
who
for
seventy
years
faithfully
served
her
master
she
had
become
almost
helpless
from
hard
labor
and
disease
her
owners
moved
to
alabama
and
the
old
black
woman
was
left
to
be
sold
to
any
body
who
would
give
twenty
dollars
for
her
iv
the
slave
who
dared
to
feel
like
a
man
two
years
had
passed
since
i
entered
flint
family
and
those
years
had
brought
much
of
the
knowledge
that
comes
from
experience
though
they
had
afforded
little
opportunity
for
any
other
kinds
of
knowledge
my
grandmother
had
as
much
as
possible
been
a
mother
to
her
orphan
grandchildren
by
perseverance
and
unwearied
industry
she
was
now
mistress
of
a
snug
little
home
surrounded
with
the
necessaries
of
life
she
would
have
been
happy
could
her
children
have
shared
them
with
her
there
remained
but
three
children
and
two
grandchildren
all
slaves
most
earnestly
did
she
strive
to
make
us
feel
that
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
he
had
seen
fit
to
place
us
under
such
circumstances
and
though
it
seemed
hard
we
ought
to
pray
for
contentment
it
was
a
beautiful
faith
coming
from
a
mother
who
could
not
call
her
children
her
own
but
i
and
benjamin
her
youngest
boy
condemned
it
we
reasoned
that
it
was
much
more
the
will
of
god
that
we
should
be
situated
as
she
was
we
longed
for
a
home
like
hers
there
we
always
found
sweet
balsam
for
our
troubles
she
was
so
loving
so
sympathizing
she
always
met
us
with
a
smile
and
listened
with
patience
to
all
our
sorrows
she
spoke
so
hopefully
that
unconsciously
the
clouds
gave
place
to
sunshine
there
was
a
grand
big
oven
there
too
that
baked
bread
and
nice
things
for
the
town
and
we
knew
there
was
always
a
choice
bit
in
store
for
us
but
alas
even
the
charms
of
the
old
oven
failed
to
reconcile
us
to
our
hard
lot
benjamin
was
now
a
tall
handsome
lad
strongly
and
gracefully
made
and
with
a
spirit
too
bold
and
daring
for
a
slave
my
brother
william
now
twelve
years
old
had
the
same
aversion
to
the
word
master
that
he
had
when
he
was
an
urchin
of
seven
years
i
was
his
confidant
he
came
to
me
with
all
his
troubles
i
remember
one
instance
in
particular
it
was
on
a
lovely
spring
morning
and
when
i
marked
the
sunlight
dancing
here
and
there
its
beauty
seemed
to
mock
my
sadness
for
my
master
whose
restless
craving
vicious
nature
roved
about
day
and
night
seeking
whom
to
devour
had
just
left
me
with
stinging
scorching
words
words
that
scathed
ear
and
brain
like
fire
o
how
i
despised
him
i
thought
how
glad
i
should
be
if
some
day
when
he
walked
the
earth
it
would
open
and
swallow
him
up
and
disencumber
the
world
of
a
plague
when
he
told
me
that
i
was
made
for
his
use
made
to
obey
his
command
in
thing
that
i
was
nothing
but
a
slave
whose
will
must
and
should
surrender
to
his
never
before
had
my
puny
arm
felt
half
so
strong
so
deeply
was
i
absorbed
in
painful
reflections
afterwards
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
the
entrance
of
any
one
till
the
voice
of
william
sounded
close
beside
me
linda
said
he
what
makes
you
look
so
sad
i
love
you
o
linda
is
this
a
bad
world
every
body
seems
so
cross
and
unhappy
i
wish
i
had
died
when
poor
father
did
i
told
him
that
every
body
was
cross
or
unhappy
that
those
who
had
pleasant
homes
and
kind
friends
and
who
were
not
afraid
to
love
them
were
happy
but
we
who
were
without
father
or
mother
could
not
expect
to
be
happy
we
must
be
good
perhaps
that
would
bring
us
contentment
yes
he
said
i
try
to
be
good
but
what
the
use
they
are
all
the
time
troubling
me
then
he
proceeded
to
relate
his
afternoon
difficulty
with
young
master
nicholas
it
seemed
that
the
brother
of
master
nicholas
had
pleased
himself
with
making
up
stories
about
william
master
nicholas
said
he
should
be
flogged
and
he
would
do
it
whereupon
he
went
to
work
but
william
fought
bravely
and
the
young
master
finding
he
was
getting
the
better
of
him
undertook
to
tie
his
hands
behind
him
he
failed
in
that
likewise
by
dint
of
kicking
and
fisting
william
came
out
of
the
skirmish
none
the
worse
for
a
few
scratches
he
continued
to
discourse
on
his
young
master
how
he
whipped
the
boys
but
was
a
perfect
coward
when
a
tussle
ensued
between
him
and
white
boys
of
his
own
size
on
such
occasions
he
always
took
to
his
legs
william
had
other
charges
to
make
against
him
one
was
his
rubbing
up
pennies
with
quicksilver
and
passing
them
off
for
quarters
of
a
dollar
on
an
old
man
who
kept
a
fruit
stall
william
was
often
sent
to
buy
fruit
and
he
earnestly
inquired
of
me
what
he
ought
to
do
under
such
circumstances
i
told
him
it
was
certainly
wrong
to
deceive
the
old
man
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
him
of
the
impositions
practised
by
his
young
master
i
assured
him
the
old
man
would
not
be
slow
to
comprehend
the
whole
and
there
the
matter
would
end
william
thought
it
might
with
the
old
man
but
not
with
he
said
he
did
not
mind
the
smart
of
the
whip
but
he
did
not
like
the
of
being
whipped
while
i
advised
him
to
be
good
and
forgiving
i
was
not
unconscious
of
the
beam
in
my
own
eye
it
was
the
very
knowledge
of
my
own
shortcomings
that
urged
me
to
retain
if
possible
some
sparks
of
my
brother
nature
i
had
not
lived
fourteen
years
in
slavery
for
nothing
i
had
felt
seen
and
heard
enough
to
read
the
characters
and
question
the
motives
of
those
around
me
the
war
of
my
life
had
begun
and
though
one
of
most
powerless
creatures
i
resolved
never
to
be
conquered
alas
for
me
if
there
was
one
pure
sunny
spot
for
me
i
believed
it
to
be
in
heart
and
in
another
whom
i
loved
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
girl
first
love
my
owner
knew
of
it
and
sought
in
every
way
to
render
me
miserable
he
did
not
resort
to
corporal
punishment
but
to
all
the
petty
tyrannical
ways
that
human
ingenuity
could
devise
i
remember
the
first
time
i
was
punished
it
was
in
the
month
of
february
my
grandmother
had
taken
my
old
shoes
and
replaced
them
with
a
new
pair
i
needed
them
for
several
inches
of
snow
had
fallen
and
it
still
continued
to
fall
when
i
walked
through
flint
room
their
creaking
grated
harshly
on
her
refined
nerves
she
called
me
to
her
and
asked
what
i
had
about
me
that
made
such
a
horrid
noise
i
told
her
it
was
my
new
shoes
take
them
off
said
she
and
if
you
put
them
on
again
i
throw
them
into
the
fire
i
took
them
off
and
my
stockings
also
she
then
sent
me
a
long
distance
on
an
errand
as
i
went
through
the
snow
my
bare
feet
tingled
that
night
i
was
very
hoarse
and
i
went
to
bed
thinking
the
next
day
would
find
me
sick
perhaps
dead
what
was
my
grief
on
waking
to
find
myself
quite
well
i
had
imagined
if
i
died
or
was
laid
up
for
some
time
that
my
mistress
would
feel
a
twinge
of
remorse
that
she
had
so
hated
the
little
imp
as
she
styled
me
it
was
my
ignorance
of
that
mistress
that
gave
rise
to
such
extravagant
imaginings
flint
occasionally
had
high
prices
offered
for
me
but
he
always
said
she
do
belong
to
me
she
is
my
daughter
property
and
i
have
no
right
to
sell
her
good
honest
man
my
young
mistress
was
still
a
child
and
i
could
look
for
no
protection
from
her
i
loved
her
and
she
returned
my
affection
i
once
heard
her
father
allude
to
her
attachment
to
me
and
his
wife
promptly
replied
that
it
proceeded
from
fear
this
put
unpleasant
doubts
into
my
mind
did
the
child
feign
what
she
did
not
feel
or
was
her
mother
jealous
of
the
mite
of
love
she
bestowed
on
me
i
concluded
it
must
be
the
latter
i
said
to
myself
surely
little
children
are
true
one
afternoon
i
sat
at
my
sewing
feeling
unusual
depression
of
spirits
my
mistress
had
been
accusing
me
of
an
offence
of
which
i
assured
her
i
was
perfectly
innocent
but
i
saw
by
the
contemptuous
curl
of
her
lip
that
she
believed
i
was
telling
a
lie
i
wondered
for
what
wise
purpose
god
was
leading
me
through
such
thorny
paths
and
whether
still
darker
days
were
in
store
for
me
as
i
sat
musing
thus
the
door
opened
softly
and
william
came
in
well
brother
said
i
what
is
the
matter
this
time
o
linda
ben
and
his
master
have
had
a
dreadful
time
said
he
my
first
thought
was
that
benjamin
was
killed
do
be
frightened
linda
said
william
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
it
appeared
that
benjamin
master
had
sent
for
him
and
he
did
not
immediately
obey
the
summons
when
he
did
his
master
was
angry
and
began
to
whip
him
he
resisted
master
and
slave
fought
and
finally
the
master
was
thrown
benjamin
had
cause
to
tremble
for
he
had
thrown
to
the
ground
his
master
one
of
the
richest
men
in
town
i
anxiously
awaited
the
result
that
night
i
stole
to
my
grandmother
house
and
benjamin
also
stole
thither
from
his
master
my
grandmother
had
gone
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
an
old
friend
living
in
the
country
i
have
come
said
benjamin
to
tell
you
good
by
i
am
going
away
i
inquired
where
to
the
north
he
replied
i
looked
at
him
to
see
whether
he
was
in
earnest
i
saw
it
all
in
his
firm
set
mouth
i
implored
him
not
to
go
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
my
words
he
said
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
and
every
day
made
his
yoke
more
galling
he
had
raised
his
hand
against
his
master
and
was
to
be
publicly
whipped
for
the
offence
i
reminded
him
of
the
poverty
and
hardships
he
must
encounter
among
strangers
i
told
him
he
might
be
caught
and
brought
back
and
that
was
terrible
to
think
of
he
grew
vexed
and
asked
if
poverty
and
hardships
with
freedom
were
not
preferable
to
our
treatment
in
slavery
linda
he
continued
we
are
dogs
here
cattle
every
thing
that
mean
no
i
will
not
stay
let
them
bring
me
back
we
do
die
but
once
he
was
right
but
it
was
hard
to
give
him
up
go
said
i
and
break
your
mother
heart
i
repented
of
my
words
ere
they
were
out
linda
said
he
speaking
as
i
had
not
heard
him
speak
that
evening
how
you
say
that
poor
mother
be
kind
to
her
linda
and
you
too
cousin
fanny
cousin
fanny
was
a
friend
who
had
lived
some
years
with
us
farewells
were
exchanged
and
the
bright
kind
boy
endeared
to
us
by
so
many
acts
of
love
vanished
from
our
sight
it
is
not
necessary
to
state
how
he
made
his
escape
suffice
it
to
say
he
was
on
his
way
to
new
york
when
a
violent
storm
overtook
the
vessel
the
captain
said
he
must
put
into
the
nearest
port
this
alarmed
benjamin
who
was
aware
that
he
would
be
advertised
in
every
port
near
his
own
town
his
embarrassment
was
noticed
by
the
captain
to
port
they
went
there
the
advertisement
met
the
captain
eye
benjamin
so
exactly
answered
its
description
that
the
captain
laid
hold
on
him
and
bound
him
in
chains
the
storm
passed
and
they
proceeded
to
new
york
before
reaching
that
port
benjamin
managed
to
get
off
his
chains
and
throw
them
overboard
he
escaped
from
the
vessel
but
was
pursued
captured
and
carried
back
to
his
master
when
my
grandmother
returned
home
and
found
her
youngest
child
had
fled
great
was
her
sorrow
but
with
characteristic
piety
she
said
god
will
be
done
each
morning
she
inquired
if
any
news
had
been
heard
from
her
boy
yes
news
heard
the
master
was
rejoicing
over
a
letter
announcing
the
capture
of
his
human
chattel
that
day
seems
but
as
yesterday
so
well
do
i
remember
it
i
saw
him
led
through
the
streets
in
chains
to
jail
his
face
was
ghastly
pale
yet
full
of
determination
he
had
begged
one
of
the
sailors
to
go
to
his
house
and
ask
her
not
to
meet
him
he
said
the
sight
of
her
distress
would
take
from
him
all
she
yearned
to
see
him
and
she
went
but
she
screened
herself
in
the
crowd
that
it
might
be
as
her
child
had
said
we
were
not
allowed
to
visit
him
but
we
had
known
the
jailer
for
years
and
he
was
a
man
at
midnight
he
opened
the
jail
door
for
my
grandmother
and
myself
to
enter
in
disguise
when
we
entered
the
cell
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
benjamin
benjamin
whispered
my
grandmother
no
answer
benjamin
she
again
faltered
there
was
a
jingle
of
chains
the
moon
had
just
risen
and
cast
an
uncertain
light
through
the
bars
of
the
window
we
knelt
down
and
took
benjamin
cold
hands
in
ours
we
did
not
speak
sobs
were
heard
and
benjamin
lips
were
unsealed
for
his
mother
was
weeping
on
his
neck
how
vividly
does
memory
bring
back
that
sad
night
mother
and
son
talked
together
he
asked
her
pardon
for
the
suffering
he
had
caused
her
she
said
she
had
nothing
to
forgive
she
could
not
blame
his
desire
for
freedom
he
told
her
that
when
he
was
captured
he
broke
away
and
was
about
casting
himself
into
the
river
when
thoughts
of
came
over
him
and
he
desisted
she
asked
if
he
did
not
also
think
of
god
i
fancied
i
saw
his
face
grow
fierce
in
the
moonlight
he
answered
no
i
did
not
think
of
him
when
a
man
is
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
he
forgets
there
is
a
god
a
heaven
he
forgets
every
thing
in
his
struggle
to
get
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bloodhounds
do
talk
so
benjamin
said
she
put
your
trust
in
god
be
humble
my
child
and
your
master
will
forgive
you
forgive
me
for
mother
for
not
letting
him
treat
me
like
a
dog
no
i
will
never
humble
myself
to
him
i
have
worked
for
him
for
nothing
all
my
life
and
i
am
repaid
with
stripes
and
imprisonment
here
i
will
stay
till
i
die
or
till
he
sells
me
the
poor
mother
shuddered
at
his
words
i
think
he
felt
it
for
when
he
next
spoke
his
voice
was
calmer
do
fret
about
me
mother
i
worth
it
said
he
i
wish
i
had
some
of
your
goodness
you
bear
every
thing
patiently
just
as
though
you
thought
it
was
all
right
i
wish
i
could
she
told
him
she
had
not
always
been
so
once
she
was
like
him
but
when
sore
troubles
came
upon
her
and
she
had
no
arm
to
lean
upon
she
learned
to
call
on
god
and
he
lightened
her
burdens
she
besought
him
to
do
likewise
we
overstaid
our
time
and
were
obliged
to
hurry
from
the
jail
benjamin
had
been
imprisoned
three
weeks
when
my
grandmother
went
to
intercede
for
him
with
his
master
he
was
immovable
he
said
benjamin
should
serve
as
an
example
to
the
rest
of
his
slaves
he
should
be
kept
in
jail
till
he
was
subdued
or
be
sold
if
he
got
but
one
dollar
for
him
however
he
afterwards
relented
in
some
degree
the
chains
were
taken
off
and
we
were
allowed
to
visit
him
as
his
food
was
of
the
coarsest
kind
we
carried
him
as
often
as
possible
a
warm
supper
accompanied
with
some
little
luxury
for
the
jailer
three
months
elapsed
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
release
or
of
a
purchaser
one
day
he
was
heard
to
sing
and
laugh
this
piece
of
indecorum
was
told
to
his
master
and
the
overseer
was
ordered
to
him
he
was
now
confined
in
an
apartment
with
other
prisoners
who
were
covered
with
filthy
rags
benjamin
was
chained
near
them
and
was
soon
covered
with
vermin
he
worked
at
his
chains
till
he
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
them
he
passed
them
through
the
bars
of
the
window
with
a
request
that
they
should
be
taken
to
his
master
and
he
should
be
informed
that
he
was
covered
with
vermin
this
audacity
was
punished
with
heavier
chains
and
prohibition
of
our
visits
my
grandmother
continued
to
send
him
fresh
changes
of
clothes
the
old
ones
were
burned
up
the
last
night
we
saw
him
in
jail
his
mother
still
begged
him
to
send
for
his
master
and
beg
his
pardon
neither
persuasion
nor
argument
could
turn
him
from
his
purpose
he
calmly
answered
i
am
waiting
his
time
those
chains
were
mournful
to
hear
another
three
months
passed
and
benjamin
left
his
prison
walls
we
that
loved
him
waited
to
bid
him
a
long
and
last
farewell
a
slave
trader
had
bought
him
you
remember
i
told
you
what
price
he
brought
when
ten
years
of
age
now
he
was
more
than
twenty
years
old
and
sold
for
three
hundred
dollars
the
master
had
been
blind
to
his
own
interest
long
confinement
had
made
his
face
too
pale
his
form
too
thin
moreover
the
trader
had
heard
something
of
his
character
and
it
did
not
strike
him
as
suitable
for
a
slave
he
said
he
would
give
any
price
if
the
handsome
lad
was
a
girl
we
thanked
god
that
he
was
not
could
you
have
seen
that
mother
clinging
to
her
child
when
they
fastened
the
irons
upon
his
wrists
could
you
have
heard
her
groans
and
seen
her
bloodshot
eyes
wander
wildly
from
face
to
face
vainly
pleading
for
mercy
could
you
have
witnessed
that
scene
as
i
saw
it
you
would
exclaim
is
benjamin
her
youngest
her
pet
was
forever
gone
she
could
not
realize
it
she
had
had
an
interview
with
the
trader
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
if
benjamin
could
be
purchased
she
was
told
it
was
impossible
as
he
had
given
bonds
not
to
sell
him
till
he
was
out
of
the
state
he
promised
that
he
would
not
sell
him
till
he
reached
new
orleans
with
a
strong
arm
and
unvaried
trust
my
grandmother
began
her
work
of
love
benjamin
must
be
free
if
she
succeeded
she
knew
they
would
still
be
separated
but
the
sacrifice
was
not
too
great
day
and
night
she
labored
the
trader
price
would
treble
that
he
gave
but
she
was
not
discouraged
she
employed
a
lawyer
to
write
to
a
gentleman
whom
she
knew
in
new
orleans
she
begged
him
to
interest
himself
for
benjamin
and
he
willingly
favored
her
request
when
he
saw
benjamin
and
stated
his
business
he
thanked
him
but
said
he
preferred
to
wait
a
while
before
making
the
trader
an
offer
he
knew
he
had
tried
to
obtain
a
high
price
for
him
and
had
invariably
failed
this
encouraged
him
to
make
another
effort
for
freedom
so
one
morning
long
before
day
benjamin
was
missing
he
was
riding
over
the
blue
billows
bound
for
baltimore
for
once
his
white
face
did
him
a
kindly
service
they
had
no
suspicion
that
it
belonged
to
a
slave
otherwise
the
law
would
have
been
followed
out
to
the
letter
and
the
rendered
back
to
slavery
the
brightest
skies
are
often
overshadowed
by
the
darkest
clouds
benjamin
was
taken
sick
and
compelled
to
remain
in
baltimore
three
weeks
his
strength
was
slow
in
returning
and
his
desire
to
continue
his
journey
seemed
to
retard
his
recovery
how
could
he
get
strength
without
air
and
exercise
he
resolved
to
venture
on
a
short
walk
a
was
selected
where
he
thought
himself
secure
of
not
being
met
by
any
one
that
knew
him
but
a
voice
called
out
halloo
ben
my
boy
what
are
you
doing
his
first
impulse
was
to
run
but
his
legs
trembled
so
that
he
could
not
stir
he
turned
to
confront
his
antagonist
and
behold
there
stood
his
old
master
next
door
neighbor
he
thought
it
was
all
over
with
him
now
but
it
proved
otherwise
that
man
was
a
miracle
he
possessed
a
goodly
number
of
slaves
and
yet
was
not
quite
deaf
to
that
mystic
clock
whose
ticking
is
rarely
heard
in
the
slaveholder
breast
ben
you
are
sick
said
he
why
you
look
like
a
ghost
i
guess
i
gave
you
something
of
a
start
never
mind
ben
i
am
not
going
to
touch
you
you
had
a
pretty
tough
time
of
it
and
you
may
go
on
your
way
rejoicing
for
all
me
but
i
would
advise
you
to
get
out
of
this
place
plaguy
quick
for
there
are
several
gentlemen
here
from
our
town
he
described
the
nearest
and
safest
route
to
new
york
and
added
i
shall
be
glad
to
tell
your
mother
i
have
seen
you
good
by
ben
benjamin
turned
away
filled
with
gratitude
and
surprised
that
the
town
he
hated
contained
such
a
gem
a
gem
worthy
of
a
purer
setting
this
gentleman
was
a
northerner
by
birth
and
had
married
a
southern
lady
on
his
return
he
told
my
grandmother
that
he
had
seen
her
son
and
of
the
service
he
had
rendered
him
benjamin
reached
new
york
safely
and
concluded
to
stop
there
until
he
had
gained
strength
enough
to
proceed
further
it
happened
that
my
grandmother
only
remaining
son
had
sailed
for
the
same
city
on
business
for
his
mistress
through
god
providence
the
brothers
met
you
may
be
sure
it
was
a
happy
meeting
o
phil
exclaimed
benjamin
i
am
here
at
last
then
he
told
him
how
near
he
came
to
dying
almost
in
sight
of
free
land
and
how
he
prayed
that
he
might
live
to
get
one
breath
of
free
air
he
said
life
was
worth
something
now
and
it
would
be
hard
to
die
in
the
old
jail
he
had
not
valued
it
once
he
was
tempted
to
destroy
it
but
something
he
did
not
know
what
had
prevented
him
perhaps
it
was
fear
he
had
heard
those
who
profess
to
be
religious
declare
there
was
no
heaven
for
and
as
his
life
had
been
pretty
hot
here
he
did
not
desire
a
continuation
of
the
same
in
another
world
if
i
die
now
he
exclaimed
thank
god
i
shall
die
a
freeman
he
begged
my
uncle
phillip
not
to
return
south
but
stay
and
work
with
him
till
they
earned
enough
to
buy
those
at
home
his
brother
told
him
it
would
kill
their
mother
if
he
deserted
her
in
her
trouble
she
had
pledged
her
house
and
with
difficulty
had
raised
money
to
buy
him
would
he
be
bought
no
never
he
replied
do
you
suppose
phil
when
i
have
got
so
far
out
of
their
clutches
i
will
give
them
one
red
cent
no
and
do
you
suppose
i
would
turn
mother
out
of
her
home
in
her
old
age
that
i
would
let
her
pay
all
those
dollars
for
me
and
never
to
see
me
for
you
know
she
will
stay
south
as
long
as
her
other
children
are
slaves
what
a
good
mother
tell
her
to
buy
phil
you
have
been
a
comfort
to
her
and
i
have
been
a
trouble
and
linda
poor
linda
what
become
of
her
phil
you
do
know
what
a
life
they
lead
her
she
has
told
me
something
about
it
and
i
wish
old
flint
was
dead
or
a
better
man
when
i
was
in
jail
he
asked
her
if
she
did
want
to
ask
my
master
to
forgive
me
and
take
me
home
again
she
told
him
no
that
i
did
want
to
go
back
he
got
mad
and
said
we
were
all
alike
i
never
despised
my
own
master
half
as
much
as
i
do
that
man
there
is
many
a
worse
slaveholder
than
my
master
but
for
all
that
i
would
not
be
his
slave
while
benjamin
was
sick
he
had
parted
with
nearly
all
his
clothes
to
pay
necessary
expenses
but
he
did
not
part
with
a
little
pin
i
fastened
in
his
bosom
when
we
parted
it
was
the
most
valuable
thing
i
owned
and
i
thought
none
more
worthy
to
wear
it
he
had
it
still
his
brother
furnished
him
with
clothes
and
gave
him
what
money
he
had
they
parted
with
moistened
eyes
and
as
benjamin
turned
away
he
said
phil
i
part
with
all
my
kindred
and
so
it
proved
we
never
heard
from
him
again
uncle
phillip
came
home
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
when
he
entered
the
house
were
mother
ben
is
free
i
have
seen
him
in
new
york
she
stood
looking
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
mother
do
you
believe
it
he
said
laying
his
hand
softly
upon
her
shoulder
she
raised
her
hands
and
exclaimed
god
be
praised
let
us
thank
him
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
poured
forth
her
heart
in
prayer
then
phillip
must
sit
down
and
repeat
to
her
every
word
benjamin
had
said
he
told
her
all
only
he
forbore
to
mention
how
sick
and
pale
her
darling
looked
why
should
he
distress
her
when
she
could
do
him
no
good
the
brave
old
woman
still
toiled
on
hoping
to
rescue
some
of
her
other
children
after
a
while
she
succeeded
in
buying
phillip
she
paid
eight
hundred
dollars
and
came
home
with
the
precious
document
that
secured
his
freedom
the
happy
mother
and
son
sat
together
by
the
old
hearthstone
that
night
telling
how
proud
they
were
of
each
other
and
how
they
would
prove
to
the
world
that
they
could
take
care
of
themselves
as
they
had
long
taken
care
of
others
we
all
concluded
by
saying
he
that
is
to
be
a
slave
let
him
be
a
slave
the
trials
of
girlhood
during
the
first
years
of
my
service
in
flint
family
i
was
accustomed
to
share
some
indulgences
with
the
children
of
my
mistress
though
this
seemed
to
me
no
more
than
right
i
was
grateful
for
it
and
tried
to
merit
the
kindness
by
the
faithful
discharge
of
my
duties
but
i
now
entered
on
my
fifteenth
year
a
sad
epoch
in
the
life
of
a
slave
girl
my
master
began
to
whisper
foul
words
in
my
ear
young
as
i
was
i
could
not
remain
ignorant
of
their
import
i
tried
to
treat
them
with
indifference
or
contempt
the
master
age
my
extreme
youth
and
the
fear
that
his
conduct
would
be
reported
to
my
grandmother
made
him
bear
this
treatment
for
many
months
he
was
a
crafty
man
and
resorted
to
many
means
to
accomplish
his
purposes
sometimes
he
had
stormy
terrific
ways
that
made
his
victims
tremble
sometimes
he
assumed
a
gentleness
that
he
thought
must
surely
subdue
of
the
two
i
preferred
his
stormy
moods
although
they
left
me
trembling
he
tried
his
utmost
to
corrupt
the
pure
principles
my
grandmother
had
instilled
he
peopled
my
young
mind
with
unclean
images
such
as
only
a
vile
monster
could
think
of
i
turned
from
him
with
disgust
and
hatred
but
he
was
my
master
i
was
compelled
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
him
where
i
saw
a
man
forty
years
my
senior
daily
violating
the
most
sacred
commandments
of
nature
he
told
me
i
was
his
property
that
i
must
be
subject
to
his
will
in
all
things
my
soul
revolted
against
the
mean
tyranny
but
where
could
i
turn
for
protection
no
matter
whether
the
slave
girl
be
as
black
as
ebony
or
as
fair
as
her
mistress
in
either
case
there
is
no
shadow
of
law
to
protect
her
from
insult
from
violence
or
even
from
death
all
these
are
inflicted
by
fiends
who
bear
the
shape
of
men
the
mistress
who
ought
to
protect
the
helpless
victim
has
no
other
feelings
towards
her
but
those
of
jealousy
and
rage
the
degradation
the
wrongs
the
vices
that
grow
out
of
slavery
are
more
than
i
can
describe
they
are
greater
than
you
would
willingly
believe
surely
if
you
credited
one
half
the
truths
that
are
told
you
concerning
the
helpless
millions
suffering
in
this
cruel
bondage
you
at
the
north
would
not
help
to
tighten
the
yoke
you
surely
would
refuse
to
do
for
the
master
on
your
own
soil
the
mean
and
cruel
work
which
trained
bloodhounds
and
the
lowest
class
of
whites
do
for
him
at
the
south
every
where
the
years
bring
to
all
enough
of
sin
and
sorrow
but
in
slavery
the
very
dawn
of
life
is
darkened
by
these
shadows
even
the
little
child
who
is
accustomed
to
wait
on
her
mistress
and
her
children
will
learn
before
she
is
twelve
years
old
why
it
is
that
her
mistress
hates
such
and
such
a
one
among
the
slaves
perhaps
the
child
own
mother
is
among
those
hated
ones
she
listens
to
violent
outbreaks
of
jealous
passion
and
can
not
help
understanding
what
is
the
cause
she
will
become
prematurely
knowing
in
evil
things
soon
she
will
learn
to
tremble
when
she
hears
her
footfall
she
will
be
compelled
to
realize
that
she
is
no
longer
a
child
if
god
has
bestowed
beauty
upon
her
it
will
prove
her
greatest
curse
that
which
commands
admiration
in
the
white
woman
only
hastens
the
degradation
of
the
female
slave
i
know
that
some
are
too
much
brutalized
by
slavery
to
feel
the
humiliation
of
their
position
but
many
slaves
feel
it
most
acutely
and
shrink
from
the
memory
of
it
i
can
not
tell
how
much
i
suffered
in
the
presence
of
these
wrongs
nor
how
i
am
still
pained
by
the
retrospect
my
master
met
me
at
every
turn
reminding
me
that
i
belonged
to
him
and
swearing
by
heaven
and
earth
that
he
would
compel
me
to
submit
to
him
if
i
went
out
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
after
a
day
of
unwearied
toil
his
footsteps
dogged
me
if
i
knelt
by
my
mother
grave
his
dark
shadow
fell
on
me
even
there
the
light
heart
which
nature
had
given
me
became
heavy
with
sad
forebodings
the
other
slaves
in
my
master
house
noticed
the
change
many
of
them
pitied
me
but
none
dared
to
ask
the
cause
they
had
no
need
to
inquire
they
knew
too
well
the
guilty
practices
under
that
roof
and
they
were
aware
that
to
speak
of
them
was
an
offence
that
never
went
unpunished
i
longed
for
some
one
to
confide
in
i
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
laid
my
head
on
my
grandmother
faithful
bosom
and
told
her
all
my
troubles
but
flint
swore
he
would
kill
me
if
i
was
not
as
silent
as
the
grave
then
although
my
grandmother
was
all
in
all
to
me
i
feared
her
as
well
as
loved
her
i
had
been
accustomed
to
look
up
to
her
with
a
respect
bordering
upon
awe
i
was
very
young
and
felt
shamefaced
about
telling
her
such
impure
things
especially
as
i
knew
her
to
be
very
strict
on
such
subjects
moreover
she
was
a
woman
of
a
high
spirit
she
was
usually
very
quiet
in
her
demeanor
but
if
her
indignation
was
once
roused
it
was
not
very
easily
quelled
i
had
been
told
that
she
once
chased
a
white
gentleman
with
a
loaded
pistol
because
he
insulted
one
of
her
daughters
i
dreaded
the
consequences
of
a
violent
outbreak
and
both
pride
and
fear
kept
me
silent
but
though
i
did
not
confide
in
my
grandmother
and
even
evaded
her
vigilant
watchfulness
and
inquiry
her
presence
in
the
neighborhood
was
some
protection
to
me
though
she
had
been
a
slave
flint
was
afraid
of
her
he
dreaded
her
scorching
rebukes
moreover
she
was
known
and
patronized
by
many
people
and
he
did
not
wish
to
have
his
villany
made
public
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
i
did
not
live
on
a
distant
plantation
but
in
a
town
not
so
large
that
the
inhabitants
were
ignorant
of
each
other
affairs
bad
as
are
the
laws
and
customs
in
a
slaveholding
community
the
doctor
as
a
professional
man
deemed
it
prudent
to
keep
up
some
outward
show
of
decency
o
what
days
and
nights
of
fear
and
sorrow
that
man
caused
me
reader
it
is
not
to
awaken
sympathy
for
myself
that
i
am
telling
you
truthfully
what
i
suffered
in
slavery
i
do
it
to
kindle
a
flame
of
compassion
in
your
hearts
for
my
sisters
who
are
still
in
bondage
suffering
as
i
once
suffered
i
once
saw
two
beautiful
children
playing
together
one
was
a
fair
white
child
the
other
was
her
slave
and
also
her
sister
when
i
saw
them
embracing
each
other
and
heard
their
joyous
laughter
i
turned
sadly
away
from
the
lovely
sight
i
foresaw
the
inevitable
blight
that
would
fall
on
the
little
slave
heart
i
knew
how
soon
her
laughter
would
be
changed
to
sighs
the
fair
child
grew
up
to
be
a
still
fairer
woman
from
childhood
to
womanhood
her
pathway
was
blooming
with
flowers
and
overarched
by
a
sunny
sky
scarcely
one
day
of
her
life
had
been
clouded
when
the
sun
rose
on
her
happy
bridal
morning
how
had
those
years
dealt
with
her
slave
sister
the
little
playmate
of
her
childhood
she
also
was
very
beautiful
but
the
flowers
and
sunshine
of
love
were
not
for
her
she
drank
the
cup
of
sin
and
shame
and
misery
whereof
her
persecuted
race
are
compelled
to
drink
in
view
of
these
things
why
are
ye
silent
ye
free
men
and
women
of
the
north
why
do
your
tongues
falter
in
maintenance
of
the
right
would
that
i
had
more
ability
but
my
heart
is
so
full
and
my
pen
is
so
weak
there
are
noble
men
and
women
who
plead
for
us
striving
to
help
those
who
can
not
help
themselves
god
bless
them
god
give
them
strength
and
courage
to
go
on
god
bless
those
every
where
who
are
laboring
to
advance
the
cause
of
humanity
vi
the
jealous
mistress
i
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
that
my
children
should
be
the
paupers
of
ireland
than
to
be
the
most
pampered
among
the
slaves
of
america
i
would
rather
drudge
out
my
life
on
a
cotton
plantation
till
the
grave
opened
to
give
me
rest
than
to
live
with
an
unprincipled
master
and
a
jealous
mistress
the
felon
home
in
a
penitentiary
is
preferable
he
may
repent
and
turn
from
the
error
of
his
ways
and
so
find
peace
but
it
is
not
so
with
a
favorite
slave
she
is
not
allowed
to
have
any
pride
of
character
it
is
deemed
a
crime
in
her
to
wish
to
be
virtuous
flint
possessed
the
key
to
her
husband
character
before
i
was
born
she
might
have
used
this
knowledge
to
counsel
and
to
screen
the
young
and
the
innocent
among
her
slaves
but
for
them
she
had
no
sympathy
they
were
the
objects
of
her
constant
suspicion
and
malevolence
she
watched
her
husband
with
unceasing
vigilance
but
he
was
well
practised
in
means
to
evade
it
what
he
could
not
find
opportunity
to
say
in
words
he
manifested
in
signs
he
invented
more
than
were
ever
thought
of
in
a
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
i
let
them
pass
as
if
i
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
and
many
were
the
curses
and
threats
bestowed
on
me
for
my
stupidity
one
day
he
caught
me
teaching
myself
to
write
he
frowned
as
if
he
was
not
well
pleased
but
i
suppose
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
such
an
accomplishment
might
help
to
advance
his
favorite
scheme
before
long
notes
were
often
slipped
into
my
hand
i
would
return
them
saying
i
ca
read
them
sir
ca
you
he
replied
then
i
must
read
them
to
you
he
always
finished
the
reading
by
asking
do
you
understand
sometimes
he
would
complain
of
the
heat
of
the
tea
room
and
order
his
supper
to
be
placed
on
a
small
table
in
the
piazza
he
would
seat
himself
there
with
a
smile
and
tell
me
to
stand
by
and
brush
away
the
flies
he
would
eat
very
slowly
pausing
between
the
mouthfuls
these
intervals
were
employed
in
describing
the
happiness
i
was
so
foolishly
throwing
away
and
in
threatening
me
with
the
penalty
that
finally
awaited
my
stubborn
disobedience
he
boasted
much
of
the
forbearance
he
had
exercised
towards
me
and
reminded
me
that
there
was
a
limit
to
his
patience
when
i
succeeded
in
avoiding
opportunities
for
him
to
talk
to
me
at
home
i
was
ordered
to
come
to
his
office
to
do
some
errand
when
there
i
was
obliged
to
stand
and
listen
to
such
language
as
he
saw
fit
to
address
to
me
sometimes
i
so
openly
expressed
my
contempt
for
him
that
he
would
become
violently
enraged
and
i
wondered
why
he
did
not
strike
me
circumstanced
as
he
was
he
probably
thought
it
was
better
policy
to
be
forebearing
but
the
state
of
things
grew
worse
and
worse
daily
in
desperation
i
told
him
that
i
must
and
would
apply
to
my
grandmother
for
protection
he
threatened
me
with
death
and
worse
than
death
if
i
made
any
complaint
to
her
strange
to
say
i
did
not
despair
i
was
naturally
of
a
buoyant
disposition
and
always
i
had
a
hope
of
somehow
getting
out
of
his
clutches
like
many
a
poor
simple
slave
before
me
i
trusted
that
some
threads
of
joy
would
yet
be
woven
into
my
dark
destiny
i
had
entered
my
sixteenth
year
and
every
day
it
became
more
apparent
that
my
presence
was
intolerable
to
flint
angry
words
frequently
passed
between
her
and
her
husband
he
had
never
punished
me
himself
and
he
would
not
allow
any
body
else
to
punish
me
in
that
respect
she
was
never
satisfied
but
in
her
angry
moods
no
terms
were
too
vile
for
her
to
bestow
upon
me
yet
i
whom
she
detested
so
bitterly
had
far
more
pity
for
her
than
he
had
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
her
life
happy
i
never
wronged
her
or
wished
to
wrong
her
and
one
word
of
kindness
from
her
would
have
brought
me
to
her
feet
after
repeated
quarrels
between
the
doctor
and
his
wife
he
announced
his
intention
to
take
his
youngest
daughter
then
four
years
old
to
sleep
in
his
apartment
it
was
necessary
that
a
servant
should
sleep
in
the
same
room
to
be
on
hand
if
the
child
stirred
i
was
selected
for
that
office
and
informed
for
what
purpose
that
arrangement
had
been
made
by
managing
to
keep
within
sight
of
people
as
much
as
possible
during
the
day
time
i
had
hitherto
succeeded
in
eluding
my
master
though
a
razor
was
often
held
to
my
throat
to
force
me
to
change
this
line
of
policy
at
night
i
slept
by
the
side
of
my
great
aunt
where
i
felt
safe
he
was
too
prudent
to
come
into
her
room
she
was
an
old
woman
and
had
been
in
the
family
many
years
moreover
as
a
married
man
and
a
professional
man
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
save
appearances
in
some
degree
but
he
resolved
to
remove
the
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
scheme
and
he
thought
he
had
planned
it
so
that
he
should
evade
suspicion
he
was
well
aware
how
much
i
prized
my
refuge
by
the
side
of
my
old
aunt
and
he
determined
to
dispossess
me
of
it
the
first
night
the
doctor
had
the
little
child
in
his
room
alone
the
next
morning
i
was
ordered
to
take
my
station
as
nurse
the
following
night
a
kind
providence
interposed
in
my
favor
during
the
day
flint
heard
of
this
new
arrangement
and
a
storm
followed
i
rejoiced
to
hear
it
rage
after
a
while
my
mistress
sent
for
me
to
come
to
her
room
her
first
question
was
did
you
know
you
were
to
sleep
in
the
doctor
room
yes
who
told
you
my
master
will
you
answer
truly
all
the
questions
i
ask
yes
tell
me
then
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
are
you
innocent
of
what
i
have
accused
you
i
am
she
handed
me
a
bible
and
said
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
kiss
this
holy
book
and
swear
before
god
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
took
the
oath
she
required
and
i
did
it
with
a
clear
conscience
you
have
taken
god
holy
word
to
testify
your
innocence
said
she
if
you
have
deceived
me
beware
now
take
this
stool
sit
down
look
me
directly
in
the
face
and
tell
me
all
that
has
passed
between
your
master
and
you
i
did
as
she
ordered
as
i
went
on
with
my
account
her
color
changed
frequently
she
wept
and
sometimes
groaned
she
spoke
in
tones
so
sad
that
i
was
touched
by
her
grief
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
but
i
was
soon
convinced
that
her
emotions
arose
from
anger
and
wounded
pride
she
felt
that
her
marriage
vows
were
desecrated
her
dignity
insulted
but
she
had
no
compassion
for
the
poor
victim
of
her
husband
perfidy
she
pitied
herself
as
a
martyr
but
she
was
incapable
of
feeling
for
the
condition
of
shame
and
misery
in
which
her
unfortunate
helpless
slave
was
placed
yet
perhaps
she
had
some
touch
of
feeling
for
me
for
when
the
conference
was
ended
she
spoke
kindly
and
promised
to
protect
me
i
should
have
been
much
comforted
by
this
assurance
if
i
could
have
had
confidence
in
it
but
my
experiences
in
slavery
had
filled
me
with
distrust
she
was
not
a
very
refined
woman
and
had
not
much
control
over
her
passions
i
was
an
object
of
her
jealousy
and
consequently
of
her
hatred
and
i
knew
i
could
not
expect
kindness
or
confidence
from
her
under
the
circumstances
in
which
i
was
placed
i
could
not
blame
her
slaveholders
wives
feel
as
other
women
would
under
similar
circumstances
the
fire
of
her
temper
kindled
from
and
now
the
flame
became
so
intense
that
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
intended
arrangement
i
knew
i
had
ignited
the
torch
and
i
expected
to
suffer
for
it
afterwards
but
i
felt
too
thankful
to
my
mistress
for
the
timely
aid
she
rendered
me
to
care
much
about
that
she
now
took
me
to
sleep
in
a
room
adjoining
her
own
there
i
was
an
object
of
her
especial
care
though
not
to
her
especial
comfort
for
she
spent
many
a
sleepless
night
to
watch
over
me
sometimes
i
woke
up
and
found
her
bending
over
me
at
other
times
she
whispered
in
my
ear
as
though
it
was
her
husband
who
was
speaking
to
me
and
listened
to
hear
what
i
would
answer
if
she
startled
me
on
such
occasions
she
would
glide
stealthily
away
and
the
next
morning
she
would
tell
me
i
had
been
talking
in
my
sleep
and
ask
who
i
was
talking
to
at
last
i
began
to
be
fearful
for
my
life
it
had
been
often
threatened
and
you
can
imagine
better
than
i
can
describe
what
an
unpleasant
sensation
it
must
produce
to
wake
up
in
the
dead
of
night
and
find
a
jealous
woman
bending
over
you
terrible
as
this
experience
was
i
had
fears
that
it
would
give
place
to
one
more
terrible
my
mistress
grew
weary
of
her
vigils
they
did
not
prove
satisfactory
she
changed
her
tactics
she
now
tried
the
trick
of
accusing
my
master
of
crime
in
my
presence
and
gave
my
name
as
the
author
of
the
accusation
to
my
utter
astonishment
he
replied
i
do
believe
it
but
if
she
did
acknowledge
it
you
tortured
her
into
exposing
me
tortured
into
exposing
him
truly
satan
had
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
color
of
his
soul
i
understood
his
object
in
making
this
false
representation
it
was
to
show
me
that
i
gained
nothing
by
seeking
the
protection
of
my
mistress
that
the
power
was
still
all
in
his
own
hands
i
pitied
flint
she
was
a
second
wife
many
years
the
junior
of
her
husband
and
the
miscreant
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
wiser
and
better
woman
she
was
completely
foiled
and
knew
not
how
to
proceed
she
would
gladly
have
had
me
flogged
for
my
supposed
false
oath
but
as
i
have
already
stated
the
doctor
never
allowed
any
one
to
whip
me
the
old
sinner
was
politic
the
application
of
the
lash
might
have
led
to
remarks
that
would
have
exposed
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
children
and
grandchildren
how
often
did
i
rejoice
that
i
lived
in
a
town
where
all
the
inhabitants
knew
each
other
if
i
had
been
on
a
remote
plantation
or
lost
among
the
multitude
of
a
crowded
city
i
should
not
be
a
living
woman
at
this
day
the
secrets
of
slavery
are
concealed
like
those
of
the
inquisition
my
master
was
to
my
knowledge
the
father
of
eleven
slaves
but
did
the
mothers
dare
to
tell
who
was
the
father
of
their
children
did
the
other
slaves
dare
to
allude
to
it
except
in
whispers
among
themselves
no
indeed
they
knew
too
well
the
terrible
consequences
my
grandmother
could
not
avoid
seeing
things
which
excited
her
suspicions
she
was
uneasy
about
me
and
tried
various
ways
to
buy
me
but
the
answer
was
always
repeated
linda
does
not
belong
to
she
is
my
daughter
property
and
i
have
no
legal
right
to
sell
her
the
conscientious
man
he
was
too
scrupulous
to
me
but
he
had
no
scruples
whatever
about
committing
a
much
greater
wrong
against
the
helpless
young
girl
placed
under
his
guardianship
as
his
property
sometimes
my
persecutor
would
ask
me
whether
i
would
like
to
be
sold
i
told
him
i
would
rather
be
sold
to
any
body
than
to
lead
such
a
life
as
i
did
on
such
occasions
he
would
assume
the
air
of
a
very
injured
individual
and
reproach
me
for
my
ingratitude
did
i
not
take
you
into
the
house
and
make
you
the
companion
of
my
own
children
he
would
say
have
ever
treated
you
like
a
negro
i
have
never
allowed
you
to
be
punished
not
even
to
please
your
mistress
and
this
is
the
recompense
i
get
you
ungrateful
girl
i
answered
that
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
screening
me
from
punishment
and
that
the
course
he
pursued
made
my
mistress
hate
me
and
persecute
me
if
i
wept
he
would
say
poor
child
do
cry
do
cry
i
will
make
peace
for
you
with
your
mistress
only
let
me
arrange
matters
in
my
own
way
poor
foolish
girl
you
do
know
what
is
for
your
own
good
i
would
cherish
you
i
would
make
a
lady
of
you
now
go
and
think
of
all
i
have
promised
you
i
did
think
of
it
reader
i
draw
no
imaginary
pictures
of
southern
homes
i
am
telling
you
the
plain
truth
yet
when
victims
make
their
escape
from
the
wild
beast
of
slavery
northerners
consent
to
act
the
part
of
bloodhounds
and
hunt
the
poor
fugitive
back
into
his
den
full
of
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanness
nay
more
they
are
not
only
willing
but
proud
to
give
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
slaveholders
the
poor
girls
have
romantic
notions
of
a
sunny
clime
and
of
the
flowering
vines
that
all
the
year
round
shade
a
happy
home
to
what
disappointments
are
they
destined
the
young
wife
soon
learns
that
the
husband
in
whose
hands
she
has
placed
her
happiness
pays
no
regard
to
his
marriage
vows
children
of
every
shade
of
complexion
play
with
her
own
fair
babies
and
too
well
she
knows
that
they
are
born
unto
him
of
his
own
household
jealousy
and
hatred
enter
the
flowery
home
and
it
is
ravaged
of
its
loveliness
southern
women
often
marry
a
man
knowing
that
he
is
the
father
of
many
little
slaves
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
it
they
regard
such
children
as
property
as
marketable
as
the
pigs
on
the
plantation
and
it
is
seldom
that
they
do
not
make
them
aware
of
this
by
passing
them
into
the
hands
as
soon
as
possible
and
thus
getting
them
out
of
their
sight
i
am
glad
to
say
there
are
some
honorable
exceptions
i
have
myself
known
two
southern
wives
who
exhorted
their
husbands
to
free
those
slaves
towards
whom
they
stood
in
a
parental
relation
and
their
request
was
granted
these
husbands
blushed
before
the
superior
nobleness
of
their
wives
natures
though
they
had
only
counselled
them
to
do
that
which
it
was
their
duty
to
do
it
commanded
their
respect
and
rendered
their
conduct
more
exemplary
concealment
was
at
an
end
and
confidence
took
the
place
of
distrust
though
this
bad
institution
deadens
the
moral
sense
even
in
white
women
to
a
fearful
extent
it
is
not
altogether
extinct
i
have
heard
southern
ladies
say
of
mr
such
a
one
he
not
only
thinks
it
no
disgrace
to
be
the
father
of
those
little
niggers
but
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
himself
their
master
i
declare
such
things
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
in
any
decent
society
vii
the
lover
why
does
the
slave
ever
love
why
allow
the
tendrils
of
the
heart
to
twine
around
objects
which
may
at
any
moment
be
wrenched
away
by
the
hand
of
violence
when
separations
come
by
the
hand
of
death
the
pious
soul
can
bow
in
resignation
and
say
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
o
lord
but
when
the
ruthless
hand
of
man
strikes
the
blow
regardless
of
the
misery
he
causes
it
is
hard
to
be
submissive
i
did
not
reason
thus
when
i
was
a
young
girl
youth
will
be
youth
i
loved
and
i
indulged
the
hope
that
the
dark
clouds
around
me
would
turn
out
a
bright
lining
i
forgot
that
in
the
land
of
my
birth
the
shadows
are
too
dense
for
light
to
penetrate
a
land
where
laughter
is
not
mirth
nor
thought
the
mind
nor
words
a
language
nor
men
mankind
where
cries
reply
to
curses
shrieks
to
blows
and
each
is
tortured
in
his
separate
hell
there
was
in
the
neighborhood
a
young
colored
carpenter
a
free
born
man
we
had
been
well
acquainted
in
childhood
and
frequently
met
together
afterwards
we
became
mutually
attached
and
he
proposed
to
marry
me
i
loved
him
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
young
girl
first
love
but
when
i
reflected
that
i
was
a
slave
and
that
the
laws
gave
no
sanction
to
the
marriage
of
such
my
heart
sank
within
me
my
lover
wanted
to
buy
me
but
i
knew
that
flint
was
too
willful
and
arbitrary
a
man
to
consent
to
that
arrangement
from
him
i
was
sure
of
experiencing
all
sort
of
opposition
and
i
had
nothing
to
hope
from
my
mistress
she
would
have
been
delighted
to
have
got
rid
of
me
but
not
in
that
way
it
would
have
relieved
her
mind
of
a
burden
if
she
could
have
seen
me
sold
to
some
distant
state
but
if
i
was
married
near
home
i
should
be
just
as
much
in
her
husband
power
as
i
had
previously
been
for
the
husband
of
a
slave
has
no
power
to
protect
her
moreover
my
mistress
like
many
others
seemed
to
think
that
slaves
had
no
right
to
any
family
ties
of
their
own
that
they
were
created
merely
to
wait
upon
the
family
of
the
mistress
i
once
heard
her
abuse
a
young
slave
girl
who
told
her
that
a
colored
man
wanted
to
make
her
his
wife
i
will
have
you
peeled
and
pickled
my
lady
said
she
if
i
ever
hear
you
mention
that
subject
again
do
you
suppose
that
i
will
have
you
tending
children
with
the
children
of
that
nigger
the
girl
to
whom
she
said
this
had
a
mulatto
child
of
course
not
acknowledged
by
its
father
the
poor
black
man
who
loved
her
would
have
been
proud
to
acknowledge
his
helpless
offspring
many
and
anxious
were
the
thoughts
i
revolved
in
my
mind
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
above
all
things
i
was
desirous
to
spare
my
lover
the
insults
that
had
cut
so
deeply
into
my
own
soul
i
talked
with
my
grandmother
about
it
and
partly
told
her
my
fears
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
the
worst
she
had
long
suspected
all
was
not
right
and
if
i
confirmed
her
suspicions
i
knew
a
storm
would
rise
that
would
prove
the
overthrow
of
all
my
hopes
this
had
been
my
support
through
many
trials
and
i
could
not
bear
to
run
the
risk
of
having
it
suddenly
dissipated
there
was
a
lady
in
the
neighborhood
a
particular
friend
of
flint
who
often
visited
the
house
i
had
a
great
respect
for
her
and
she
had
always
manifested
a
friendly
interest
in
me
grandmother
thought
she
would
have
great
influence
with
the
doctor
i
went
to
this
lady
and
told
her
my
story
i
told
her
i
was
aware
that
my
lover
being
a
man
would
prove
a
great
objection
but
he
wanted
to
buy
me
and
if
flint
would
consent
to
that
arrangement
i
felt
sure
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
any
reasonable
price
she
knew
that
flint
disliked
me
therefore
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
perhaps
my
mistress
would
approve
of
my
being
sold
as
that
would
rid
her
of
me
the
lady
listened
with
kindly
sympathy
and
promised
to
do
her
utmost
to
promote
my
wishes
she
had
an
interview
with
the
doctor
and
i
believe
she
pleaded
my
cause
earnestly
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
how
i
dreaded
my
master
now
every
minute
i
expected
to
be
summoned
to
his
presence
but
the
day
passed
and
i
heard
nothing
from
him
the
next
morning
a
message
was
brought
to
me
master
wants
you
in
his
study
i
found
the
door
ajar
and
i
stood
a
moment
gazing
at
the
hateful
man
who
claimed
a
right
to
rule
me
body
and
soul
i
entered
and
tried
to
appear
calm
i
did
not
want
him
to
know
how
my
heart
was
bleeding
he
looked
fixedly
at
me
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
i
have
half
a
mind
to
kill
you
on
the
spot
at
last
he
broke
the
silence
and
that
was
a
relief
to
both
of
us
so
you
want
to
be
married
do
you
said
he
and
to
a
free
nigger
yes
sir
well
i
soon
convince
you
whether
i
am
your
master
or
the
nigger
fellow
you
honor
so
highly
if
you
have
a
husband
you
may
take
up
with
one
of
my
slaves
what
a
situation
i
should
be
in
as
the
wife
of
one
of
slaves
even
if
my
heart
had
been
interested
i
replied
do
you
suppose
sir
that
a
slave
can
have
some
preference
about
marrying
do
you
suppose
that
all
men
are
alike
to
her
do
you
love
this
nigger
said
he
abruptly
yes
sir
how
dare
you
tell
me
so
he
exclaimed
in
great
wrath
after
a
slight
pause
he
added
i
supposed
you
thought
more
of
yourself
that
you
felt
above
the
insults
of
such
puppies
i
replied
if
he
is
a
puppy
i
am
a
puppy
for
we
are
both
of
the
negro
race
it
is
right
and
honorable
for
us
to
love
each
other
the
man
you
call
a
puppy
never
insulted
me
sir
and
he
would
not
love
me
if
he
did
not
believe
me
to
be
a
virtuous
woman
he
sprang
upon
me
like
a
tiger
and
gave
me
a
stunning
blow
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
struck
me
and
fear
did
not
enable
me
to
control
my
anger
when
i
had
recovered
a
little
from
the
effects
i
exclaimed
you
have
struck
me
for
answering
you
honestly
how
i
despise
you
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
perhaps
he
was
deciding
what
should
be
my
punishment
or
perhaps
he
wanted
to
give
me
time
to
reflect
on
what
i
had
said
and
to
whom
i
had
said
it
finally
he
asked
do
you
know
what
you
have
said
yes
sir
but
your
treatment
drove
me
to
it
do
you
know
that
i
have
a
right
to
do
as
i
like
with
you
that
i
can
kill
you
if
i
please
you
have
tried
to
kill
me
and
i
wish
you
had
but
you
have
no
right
to
do
as
you
like
with
me
silence
he
exclaimed
in
a
thundering
voice
by
heavens
girl
you
forget
yourself
too
far
are
you
mad
if
you
are
i
will
soon
bring
you
to
your
senses
do
you
think
any
other
master
would
bear
what
i
have
borne
from
you
this
morning
many
masters
would
have
killed
you
on
the
spot
how
would
you
like
to
be
sent
to
jail
for
your
insolence
i
know
i
have
been
disrespectful
sir
i
replied
but
you
drove
me
to
it
i
could
help
it
as
for
the
jail
there
would
be
more
peace
for
me
there
than
there
is
here
you
deserve
to
go
there
said
he
and
to
be
under
such
treatment
that
you
would
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
it
would
do
you
good
it
would
take
some
of
your
high
notions
out
of
you
but
i
am
not
ready
to
send
you
there
yet
notwithstanding
your
ingratitude
for
all
my
kindness
and
forbearance
you
have
been
the
plague
of
my
life
i
have
wanted
to
make
you
happy
and
i
have
been
repaid
with
the
basest
ingratitude
but
though
you
have
proved
yourself
incapable
of
appreciating
my
kindness
i
will
be
lenient
towards
you
linda
i
will
give
you
one
more
chance
to
redeem
your
character
if
you
behave
yourself
and
do
as
i
require
i
will
forgive
you
and
treat
you
as
i
always
have
done
but
if
you
disobey
me
i
will
punish
you
as
i
would
the
meanest
slave
on
my
plantation
never
let
me
hear
that
fellow
name
mentioned
again
if
i
ever
know
of
your
speaking
to
him
i
will
cowhide
you
both
and
if
i
catch
him
lurking
about
my
premises
i
will
shoot
him
as
soon
as
i
would
a
dog
do
you
hear
what
i
say
i
teach
you
a
lesson
about
marriage
and
free
niggers
now
go
and
let
this
be
the
last
time
i
have
occasion
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
reader
did
you
ever
hate
i
hope
not
i
never
did
but
once
and
i
trust
i
never
shall
again
somebody
has
called
it
the
atmosphere
of
hell
and
i
believe
it
is
so
for
a
fortnight
the
doctor
did
not
speak
to
me
he
thought
to
mortify
me
to
make
me
feel
that
i
had
disgraced
myself
by
receiving
the
honorable
addresses
of
a
respectable
colored
man
in
preference
to
the
base
proposals
of
a
white
man
but
though
his
lips
disdained
to
address
me
his
eyes
were
very
loquacious
no
animal
ever
watched
its
prey
more
narrowly
than
he
watched
me
he
knew
that
i
could
write
though
he
had
failed
to
make
me
read
his
letters
and
he
was
now
troubled
lest
i
should
exchange
letters
with
another
man
after
a
while
he
became
weary
of
silence
and
i
was
sorry
for
it
one
morning
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
to
leave
the
house
he
contrived
to
thrust
a
note
into
my
hand
i
thought
i
had
better
read
it
and
spare
myself
the
vexation
of
having
him
read
it
to
me
it
expressed
regret
for
the
blow
he
had
given
me
and
reminded
me
that
i
myself
was
wholly
to
blame
for
it
he
hoped
i
had
become
convinced
of
the
injury
i
was
doing
myself
by
incurring
his
displeasure
he
wrote
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
louisiana
that
he
should
take
several
slaves
with
him
and
intended
i
should
be
one
of
the
number
my
mistress
would
remain
where
she
was
therefore
i
should
have
nothing
to
fear
from
that
quarter
if
i
merited
kindness
from
him
he
assured
me
that
it
would
be
lavishly
bestowed
he
begged
me
to
think
over
the
matter
and
answer
the
following
day
the
next
morning
i
was
called
to
carry
a
pair
of
scissors
to
his
room
i
laid
them
on
the
table
with
the
letter
beside
them
he
thought
it
was
my
answer
and
did
not
call
me
back
i
went
as
usual
to
attend
my
young
mistress
to
and
from
school
he
met
me
in
the
street
and
ordered
me
to
stop
at
his
office
on
my
way
back
when
i
entered
he
showed
me
his
letter
and
asked
me
why
i
had
not
answered
it
i
replied
i
am
your
property
and
it
is
in
your
power
to
send
me
or
take
me
wherever
you
please
he
said
he
was
very
glad
to
find
me
so
willing
to
go
and
that
we
should
start
early
in
the
autumn
he
had
a
large
practice
in
the
town
and
i
rather
thought
he
had
made
up
the
story
merely
to
frighten
me
however
that
might
be
i
was
determined
that
i
would
never
go
to
louisiana
with
him
summer
passed
away
and
early
in
the
autumn
flint
eldest
son
was
sent
to
louisiana
to
examine
the
country
with
a
view
to
emigrating
that
news
did
not
disturb
me
i
knew
very
well
that
i
should
not
be
sent
with
that
i
had
not
been
taken
to
the
plantation
before
this
time
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
son
was
there
he
was
jealous
of
his
son
and
jealousy
of
the
overseer
had
kept
him
from
punishing
me
by
sending
me
into
the
fields
to
work
is
it
strange
that
i
was
not
proud
of
these
protectors
as
for
the
overseer
he
was
a
man
for
whom
i
had
less
respect
than
i
had
for
a
bloodhound
young
flint
did
not
bring
back
a
favorable
report
of
louisiana
and
i
heard
no
more
of
that
scheme
soon
after
this
my
lover
met
me
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
i
stopped
to
speak
to
him
looking
up
i
saw
my
master
watching
us
from
his
window
i
hurried
home
trembling
with
fear
i
was
sent
for
immediately
to
go
to
his
room
he
met
me
with
a
blow
when
is
mistress
to
be
married
said
he
in
a
sneering
tone
a
shower
of
oaths
and
imprecations
followed
how
thankful
i
was
that
my
lover
was
a
free
man
that
my
tyrant
had
no
power
to
flog
him
for
speaking
to
me
in
the
street
again
and
again
i
revolved
in
my
mind
how
all
this
would
end
there
was
no
hope
that
the
doctor
would
consent
to
sell
me
on
any
terms
he
had
an
iron
will
and
was
determined
to
keep
me
and
to
conquer
me
my
lover
was
an
intelligent
and
religious
man
even
if
he
could
have
obtained
permission
to
marry
me
while
i
was
a
slave
the
marriage
would
give
him
no
power
to
protect
me
from
my
master
it
would
have
made
him
miserable
to
witness
the
insults
i
should
have
been
subjected
to
and
then
if
we
had
children
i
knew
they
must
follow
the
condition
of
the
mother
what
a
terrible
blight
that
would
be
on
the
heart
of
a
free
intelligent
father
for
sake
i
felt
that
i
ought
not
to
link
his
fate
with
my
own
unhappy
destiny
he
was
going
to
savannah
to
see
about
a
little
property
left
him
by
an
uncle
and
hard
as
it
was
to
bring
my
feelings
to
it
i
earnestly
entreated
him
not
to
come
back
i
advised
him
to
go
to
the
free
states
where
his
tongue
would
not
be
tied
and
where
his
intelligence
would
be
of
more
avail
to
him
he
left
me
still
hoping
the
day
would
come
when
i
could
be
bought
with
me
the
lamp
of
hope
had
gone
out
the
dream
of
my
girlhood
was
over
i
felt
lonely
and
desolate
still
i
was
not
stripped
of
all
i
still
had
my
good
grandmother
and
my
affectionate
brother
when
he
put
his
arms
round
my
neck
and
looked
into
my
eyes
as
if
to
read
there
the
troubles
i
dared
not
tell
i
felt
that
i
still
had
something
to
love
but
even
that
pleasant
emotion
was
chilled
by
the
reflection
that
he
might
be
torn
from
me
at
any
moment
by
some
sudden
freak
of
my
master
if
he
had
known
how
we
loved
each
other
i
think
he
would
have
exulted
in
separating
us
we
often
planned
together
how
we
could
get
to
the
north
but
as
william
remarked
such
things
are
easier
said
than
done
my
movements
were
very
closely
watched
and
we
had
no
means
of
getting
any
money
to
defray
our
expenses
as
for
grandmother
she
was
strongly
opposed
to
her
children
undertaking
any
such
project
she
had
not
forgotten
poor
benjamin
sufferings
and
she
was
afraid
that
if
another
child
tried
to
escape
he
would
have
a
similar
or
a
worse
fate
to
me
nothing
seemed
more
dreadful
than
my
present
life
i
said
to
myself
william
be
free
he
shall
go
to
the
north
and
i
will
follow
him
many
a
slave
sister
has
formed
the
same
plans
viii
what
slaves
are
taught
to
think
of
the
north
slaveholders
pride
themselves
upon
being
honorable
men
but
if
you
were
to
hear
the
enormous
lies
they
tell
their
slaves
you
would
have
small
respect
for
their
veracity
i
have
spoken
plain
english
pardon
me
i
can
not
use
a
milder
term
when
they
visit
the
north
and
return
home
they
tell
their
slaves
of
the
runaways
they
have
seen
and
describe
them
to
be
in
the
most
deplorable
condition
a
slaveholder
once
told
me
that
he
had
seen
a
runaway
friend
of
mine
in
new
york
and
that
she
besought
him
to
take
her
back
to
her
master
for
she
was
literally
dying
of
starvation
that
many
days
she
had
only
one
cold
potato
to
eat
and
at
other
times
could
get
nothing
at
all
he
said
he
refused
to
take
her
because
he
knew
her
master
would
not
thank
him
for
bringing
such
a
miserable
wretch
to
his
house
he
ended
by
saying
to
me
this
is
the
punishment
she
brought
on
herself
for
running
away
from
a
kind
master
this
whole
story
was
false
i
afterwards
staid
with
that
friend
in
new
york
and
found
her
in
comfortable
circumstances
she
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
wishing
to
go
back
to
slavery
many
of
the
slaves
believe
such
stories
and
think
it
is
not
worth
while
to
exchange
slavery
for
such
a
hard
kind
of
freedom
it
is
difficult
to
persuade
such
that
freedom
could
make
them
useful
men
and
enable
them
to
protect
their
wives
and
children
if
those
heathen
in
our
christian
land
had
as
much
teaching
as
some
hindoos
they
would
think
otherwise
they
would
know
that
liberty
is
more
valuable
than
life
they
would
begin
to
understand
their
own
capabilities
and
exert
themselves
to
become
men
and
women
but
while
the
free
states
sustain
a
law
which
hurls
fugitives
back
into
slavery
how
can
the
slaves
resolve
to
become
men
there
are
some
who
strive
to
protect
wives
and
daughters
from
the
insults
of
their
masters
but
those
who
have
such
sentiments
have
had
advantages
above
the
general
mass
of
slaves
they
have
been
partially
civilized
and
christianized
by
favorable
circumstances
some
are
bold
enough
to
such
sentiments
to
their
masters
o
that
there
were
more
of
them
some
poor
creatures
have
been
so
brutalized
by
the
lash
that
they
will
sneak
out
of
the
way
to
give
their
masters
free
access
to
their
wives
and
daughters
do
you
think
this
proves
the
black
man
to
belong
to
an
inferior
order
of
beings
what
would
be
if
you
had
been
born
and
brought
up
a
slave
with
generations
of
slaves
for
ancestors
i
admit
that
the
black
man
inferior
but
what
is
it
that
makes
him
so
it
is
the
ignorance
in
which
white
men
compel
him
to
live
it
is
the
torturing
whip
that
lashes
manhood
out
of
him
it
is
the
fierce
bloodhounds
of
the
south
and
the
scarcely
less
cruel
human
bloodhounds
of
the
north
who
enforce
the
fugitive
slave
law
do
the
work
southern
gentlemen
indulge
in
the
most
contemptuous
expressions
about
the
yankees
while
they
on
their
part
consent
to
do
the
vilest
work
for
them
such
as
the
ferocious
bloodhounds
and
the
despised
are
employed
to
do
at
home
when
southerners
go
to
the
north
they
are
proud
to
do
them
honor
but
the
northern
man
is
not
welcome
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
unless
he
suppresses
every
thought
and
feeling
at
variance
with
their
peculiar
institution
nor
is
it
enough
to
be
silent
the
masters
are
not
pleased
unless
they
obtain
a
greater
degree
of
subservience
than
that
and
they
are
generally
accommodated
do
they
respect
the
northerner
for
this
i
trow
not
even
the
slaves
despise
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
and
that
is
the
class
they
generally
see
when
northerners
go
to
the
south
to
reside
they
prove
very
apt
scholars
they
soon
imbibe
the
sentiments
and
disposition
of
their
neighbors
and
generally
go
beyond
their
teachers
of
the
two
they
are
proverbially
the
hardest
masters
they
seem
to
satisfy
their
consciences
with
the
doctrine
that
god
created
the
africans
to
be
slaves
what
a
libel
upon
the
heavenly
father
who
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
and
then
who
africans
who
can
measure
the
amount
of
blood
coursing
in
the
veins
of
american
slaves
i
have
spoken
of
the
pains
slaveholders
take
to
give
their
slaves
a
bad
opinion
of
the
north
but
notwithstanding
this
intelligent
slaves
are
aware
that
they
have
many
friends
in
the
free
states
even
the
most
ignorant
have
some
confused
notions
about
it
they
knew
that
i
could
read
and
i
was
often
asked
if
i
had
seen
any
thing
in
the
newspapers
about
white
folks
over
in
the
big
north
who
were
trying
to
get
their
freedom
for
them
some
believe
that
the
abolitionists
have
already
made
them
free
and
that
it
is
established
by
law
but
that
their
masters
prevent
the
law
from
going
into
effect
one
woman
begged
me
to
get
a
newspaper
and
read
it
over
she
said
her
husband
told
her
that
the
black
people
had
sent
word
to
the
queen
of
that
they
were
all
slaves
that
she
did
believe
it
and
went
to
washington
city
to
see
the
president
about
it
they
quarrelled
she
drew
her
sword
upon
him
and
swore
that
he
should
help
her
to
make
them
all
free
that
poor
ignorant
woman
thought
that
america
was
governed
by
a
queen
to
whom
the
president
was
subordinate
i
wish
the
president
was
subordinate
to
queen
justice
ix
sketches
of
neighboring
slaveholders
there
was
a
planter
in
the
country
not
far
from
us
whom
i
will
call
litch
he
was
an
uneducated
man
but
very
wealthy
he
had
six
hundred
slaves
many
of
whom
he
did
not
know
by
sight
his
extensive
plantation
was
managed
by
overseers
there
was
a
jail
and
a
whipping
post
on
his
grounds
and
whatever
cruelties
were
perpetrated
there
they
passed
without
comment
he
was
so
effectually
screened
by
his
great
wealth
that
he
was
called
to
no
account
for
his
crimes
not
even
for
murder
various
were
the
punishments
resorted
to
a
favorite
one
was
to
tie
a
rope
round
a
man
body
and
suspend
him
from
the
ground
a
fire
was
kindled
over
him
from
which
was
suspended
a
piece
of
fat
pork
as
this
cooked
the
scalding
drops
of
fat
continually
fell
on
the
bare
flesh
on
his
own
plantation
he
required
very
strict
obedience
to
the
eighth
commandment
but
depredations
on
the
neighbors
were
allowable
provided
the
culprit
managed
to
evade
detection
or
suspicion
if
a
neighbor
brought
a
charge
of
theft
against
any
of
his
slaves
he
was
browbeaten
by
the
master
who
assured
him
that
his
slaves
had
enough
of
every
thing
at
home
and
had
no
inducement
to
steal
no
sooner
was
the
neighbor
back
turned
than
the
accused
was
sought
out
and
whipped
for
his
lack
of
discretion
if
a
slave
stole
from
him
even
a
pound
of
meat
or
a
peck
of
corn
if
detection
followed
he
was
put
in
chains
and
imprisoned
and
so
kept
till
his
form
was
attentuated
by
hunger
and
suffering
a
freshnet
once
bore
his
wine
cellar
and
meat
house
miles
away
from
the
plantation
some
slaves
followed
and
secured
bits
of
meat
and
bottles
of
wine
two
were
detected
a
ham
and
some
liquor
being
found
in
their
huts
they
were
summoned
by
their
master
no
words
were
used
but
a
club
felled
them
to
the
ground
a
rough
box
was
their
coffin
and
their
interment
was
a
dog
burial
nothing
was
said
murder
was
so
common
on
his
plantation
that
he
feared
to
be
alone
after
nightfall
he
might
have
believed
in
ghosts
his
brother
if
not
equal
in
wealth
was
at
least
equal
in
cruelty
his
bloodhounds
were
well
trained
their
pen
was
spacious
and
a
terror
to
the
slaves
they
were
let
loose
on
a
runway
and
if
they
tracked
him
they
literally
tore
the
flesh
from
his
bones
when
this
slaveholder
died
his
shrieks
and
groans
were
so
frightful
that
they
appalled
his
own
friends
his
last
words
were
i
am
going
to
hell
bury
my
money
with
me
after
death
his
eyes
remained
open
to
press
the
lids
down
silver
dollars
were
laid
on
them
these
were
buried
with
him
from
this
circumstance
a
rumor
went
abroad
that
his
coffin
was
filled
with
money
three
times
his
grave
was
opened
and
his
coffin
taken
out
the
last
time
his
body
was
found
on
the
ground
and
a
flock
of
buzzards
were
pecking
at
it
he
was
again
interred
and
a
sentinel
set
over
his
grave
the
perpetrators
were
never
discovered
cruelty
is
contagious
in
uncivilized
communities
conant
a
neighbor
of
litch
returned
from
town
one
evening
in
a
partial
state
of
intoxication
his
body
servant
gave
him
some
offence
he
was
divested
of
his
clothes
except
his
shirt
whipped
and
tied
to
a
large
tree
in
front
of
the
house
it
was
a
stormy
night
in
winter
the
wind
blew
bitterly
cold
and
the
boughs
of
the
old
tree
crackled
under
falling
sleet
a
member
of
the
family
fearing
he
would
freeze
to
death
begged
that
he
might
be
taken
down
but
the
master
would
not
relent
he
remained
there
three
hours
and
when
he
was
cut
down
he
was
more
dead
than
alive
another
slave
who
stole
a
pig
from
this
master
to
appease
his
hunger
was
terribly
flogged
in
desperation
he
tried
to
run
away
but
at
the
end
of
two
miles
he
was
so
faint
with
loss
of
blood
he
thought
he
was
dying
he
had
a
wife
and
he
longed
to
see
her
once
more
too
sick
to
walk
he
crept
back
that
long
distance
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
he
reached
his
master
it
was
night
he
had
not
strength
to
rise
and
open
the
gate
he
moaned
and
tried
to
call
for
help
i
had
a
friend
living
in
the
same
family
at
last
his
cry
reached
her
she
went
out
and
found
the
prostrate
man
at
the
gate
she
ran
back
to
the
house
for
assistance
and
two
men
returned
with
her
they
carried
him
in
and
laid
him
on
the
floor
the
back
of
his
shirt
was
one
clot
of
blood
by
means
of
lard
my
friend
loosened
it
from
the
raw
flesh
she
bandaged
him
gave
him
cool
drink
and
left
him
to
rest
the
master
said
he
deserved
a
hundred
more
lashes
when
his
own
labor
was
stolen
from
him
he
had
stolen
food
to
appease
his
hunger
this
was
his
crime
another
neighbor
was
a
wade
at
no
hour
of
the
day
was
there
cessation
of
the
lash
on
her
premises
her
labors
began
with
the
dawn
and
did
not
cease
till
long
after
nightfall
the
barn
was
her
particular
place
of
torture
there
she
lashed
the
slaves
with
the
might
of
a
man
an
old
slave
of
hers
once
said
to
me
it
is
hell
in
missis
house
i
can
never
get
out
day
and
night
i
prays
to
die
the
mistress
died
before
the
old
woman
and
when
dying
entreated
her
husband
not
to
permit
any
one
of
her
slaves
to
look
on
her
after
death
a
slave
who
had
nursed
her
children
and
had
still
a
child
in
her
care
watched
her
chance
and
stole
with
it
in
her
arms
to
the
room
where
lay
her
dead
mistress
she
gazed
a
while
on
her
then
raised
her
hand
and
dealt
two
blows
on
her
face
saying
as
she
did
so
the
devil
is
got
you
she
forgot
that
the
child
was
looking
on
she
had
just
begun
to
talk
and
she
said
to
her
father
i
did
see
ma
and
mammy
did
strike
ma
so
striking
her
own
face
with
her
little
hand
the
master
was
startled
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
nurse
could
obtain
access
to
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
for
he
kept
the
door
locked
he
questioned
her
she
confessed
that
what
the
child
had
said
was
true
and
told
how
she
had
procured
the
key
she
was
sold
to
georgia
in
my
childhood
i
knew
a
valuable
slave
named
charity
and
loved
her
as
all
children
did
her
young
mistress
married
and
took
her
to
louisiana
her
little
boy
james
was
sold
to
a
good
sort
of
master
he
became
involved
in
debt
and
james
was
sold
again
to
a
wealthy
slaveholder
noted
for
his
cruelty
with
this
man
he
grew
up
to
manhood
receiving
the
treatment
of
a
dog
after
a
severe
whipping
to
save
himself
from
further
infliction
of
the
lash
with
which
he
was
threatened
he
took
to
the
woods
he
was
in
a
most
miserable
condition
cut
by
the
cowskin
half
naked
half
starved
and
without
the
means
of
procuring
a
crust
of
bread
some
weeks
after
his
escape
he
was
captured
tied
and
carried
back
to
his
master
plantation
this
man
considered
punishment
in
his
jail
on
bread
and
water
after
receiving
hundreds
of
lashes
too
mild
for
the
poor
slave
offence
therefore
he
decided
after
the
overseer
should
have
whipped
him
to
his
satisfaction
to
have
him
placed
between
the
screws
of
the
cotton
gin
to
stay
as
long
as
he
had
been
in
the
woods
this
wretched
creature
was
cut
with
the
whip
from
his
head
to
his
feet
then
washed
with
strong
brine
to
prevent
the
flesh
from
mortifying
and
make
it
heal
sooner
than
it
otherwise
would
he
was
then
put
into
the
cotton
gin
which
was
screwed
down
only
allowing
him
room
to
turn
on
his
side
when
he
could
not
lie
on
his
back
every
morning
a
slave
was
sent
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
bowl
of
water
which
was
placed
within
reach
of
the
poor
fellow
the
slave
was
charged
under
penalty
of
severe
punishment
not
to
speak
to
him
four
days
passed
and
the
slave
continued
to
carry
the
bread
and
water
on
the
second
morning
he
found
the
bread
gone
but
the
water
untouched
when
he
had
been
in
the
press
four
days
and
five
night
the
slave
informed
his
master
that
the
water
had
not
been
used
for
four
mornings
and
that
horrible
stench
came
from
the
gin
house
the
overseer
was
sent
to
examine
into
it
when
the
press
was
unscrewed
the
dead
body
was
found
partly
eaten
by
rats
and
vermin
perhaps
the
rats
that
devoured
his
bread
had
gnawed
him
before
life
was
extinct
poor
charity
grandmother
and
i
often
asked
each
other
how
her
affectionate
heart
would
bear
the
news
if
she
should
ever
hear
of
the
murder
of
her
son
we
had
known
her
husband
and
knew
that
james
was
like
him
in
manliness
and
intelligence
these
were
the
qualities
that
made
it
so
hard
for
him
to
be
a
plantation
slave
they
put
him
into
a
rough
box
and
buried
him
with
less
feeling
than
would
have
been
manifested
for
an
old
house
dog
nobody
asked
any
questions
he
was
a
slave
and
the
feeling
was
that
the
master
had
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
his
own
property
and
what
did
care
for
the
value
of
a
slave
he
had
hundreds
of
them
when
they
had
finished
their
daily
toil
they
must
hurry
to
eat
their
little
morsels
and
be
ready
to
extinguish
their
pine
knots
before
nine
when
the
overseer
went
his
patrol
rounds
he
entered
every
cabin
to
see
that
men
and
their
wives
had
gone
to
bed
together
lest
the
men
from
should
fall
asleep
in
the
chimney
corner
and
remain
there
till
the
morning
horn
called
them
to
their
daily
task
women
are
considered
of
no
value
unless
they
continually
increase
their
stock
they
are
put
on
a
par
with
animals
this
same
master
shot
a
woman
through
the
head
who
had
run
away
and
been
brought
back
to
him
no
one
called
him
to
account
for
it
if
a
slave
resisted
being
whipped
the
bloodhounds
were
unpacked
and
set
upon
him
to
tear
his
flesh
from
his
bones
the
master
who
did
these
things
was
highly
educated
and
styled
a
perfect
gentleman
he
also
boasted
the
name
and
standing
of
a
christian
though
satan
never
had
a
truer
follower
i
could
tell
of
more
slaveholders
as
cruel
as
those
i
have
described
they
are
not
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
i
do
not
say
there
are
no
humane
slaveholders
such
characters
do
exist
notwithstanding
the
hardening
influences
around
them
but
they
are
like
angels
visits
few
and
far
between
i
knew
a
young
lady
who
was
one
of
these
rare
specimens
she
was
an
orphan
and
inherited
as
slaves
a
woman
and
her
six
children
their
father
was
a
free
man
they
had
a
comfortable
home
of
their
own
parents
and
children
living
together
the
mother
and
eldest
daughter
served
their
mistress
during
the
day
and
at
night
returned
to
their
dwelling
which
was
on
the
premises
the
young
lady
was
very
pious
and
there
was
some
reality
in
her
religion
she
taught
her
slaves
to
lead
pure
lives
and
wished
them
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
own
industry
religion
was
not
a
garb
put
on
for
sunday
and
laid
aside
till
sunday
returned
again
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
slave
mother
was
promised
in
marriage
to
a
free
man
and
the
day
before
the
wedding
this
good
mistress
emancipated
her
in
order
that
her
marriage
might
have
the
sanction
of
report
said
that
this
young
lady
cherished
an
unrequited
affection
for
a
man
who
had
resolved
to
marry
for
wealth
in
the
course
of
time
a
rich
uncle
of
hers
died
he
left
six
thousand
dollars
to
his
two
sons
by
a
colored
woman
and
the
remainder
of
his
property
to
this
orphan
niece
the
metal
soon
attracted
the
magnet
the
lady
and
her
weighty
purse
became
his
she
offered
to
manumit
her
slaves
telling
them
that
her
marriage
might
make
unexpected
changes
in
their
destiny
and
she
wished
to
insure
their
happiness
they
refused
to
take
their
freedom
saying
that
she
had
always
been
their
best
friend
and
they
could
not
be
so
happy
any
where
as
with
her
i
was
not
surprised
i
had
often
seen
them
in
their
comfortable
home
and
thought
that
the
whole
town
did
not
contain
a
happier
family
they
had
never
felt
slavery
and
when
it
was
too
late
they
were
convinced
of
its
reality
when
the
new
master
claimed
this
family
as
his
property
the
father
became
furious
and
went
to
his
mistress
for
protection
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
now
harry
said
she
i
no
longer
have
the
power
i
had
a
week
ago
i
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
freedom
of
your
wife
but
i
can
not
obtain
it
for
your
children
the
unhappy
father
swore
that
nobody
should
take
his
children
from
him
he
concealed
them
in
the
woods
for
some
days
but
they
were
discovered
and
taken
the
father
was
put
in
jail
and
the
two
oldest
boys
sold
to
georgia
one
little
girl
too
young
to
be
of
service
to
her
master
was
left
with
the
wretched
mother
the
other
three
were
carried
to
their
master
plantation
the
eldest
soon
became
a
mother
and
when
the
slaveholder
wife
looked
at
the
babe
she
wept
bitterly
she
knew
that
her
own
husband
had
violated
the
purity
she
had
so
carefully
inculcated
she
had
a
second
child
by
her
master
and
then
he
sold
her
and
his
offspring
to
his
brother
she
bore
two
children
to
the
brother
and
was
sold
again
the
next
sister
went
crazy
the
life
she
was
compelled
to
lead
drove
her
mad
the
third
one
became
the
mother
of
five
daughters
before
the
birth
of
the
fourth
the
pious
mistress
died
to
the
last
she
rendered
every
kindness
to
the
slaves
that
her
unfortunate
circumstances
permitted
she
passed
away
peacefully
glad
to
close
her
eyes
on
a
life
which
had
been
made
so
wretched
by
the
man
she
loved
this
man
squandered
the
fortune
he
had
received
and
sought
to
retrieve
his
affairs
by
a
second
marriage
but
having
retired
after
a
night
of
drunken
debauch
he
was
found
dead
in
the
morning
he
was
called
a
good
master
for
he
fed
and
clothed
his
slaves
better
than
most
masters
and
the
lash
was
not
heard
on
his
plantation
so
frequently
as
on
many
others
had
it
not
been
for
slavery
he
would
have
been
a
better
man
and
his
wife
a
happier
woman
no
pen
can
give
an
adequate
description
of
the
corruption
produced
by
slavery
the
slave
girl
is
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
licentiousness
and
fear
the
lash
and
the
foul
talk
of
her
master
and
his
sons
are
her
teachers
when
she
is
fourteen
or
fifteen
her
owner
or
his
sons
or
the
overseer
or
perhaps
all
of
them
begin
to
bribe
her
with
presents
if
these
fail
to
accomplish
their
purpose
she
is
whipped
or
starved
into
submission
to
their
will
she
may
have
had
religious
principles
inculcated
by
some
pious
mother
or
grandmother
or
some
good
mistress
she
may
have
a
lover
whose
good
opinion
and
peace
of
mind
are
dear
to
her
heart
or
the
profligate
men
who
have
power
over
her
may
be
exceedingly
odious
to
her
but
resistance
is
hopeless
the
poor
worm
shall
prove
her
contest
vain
life
little
day
shall
pass
and
she
is
gone
the
slaveholder
sons
are
of
course
vitiated
even
while
boys
by
the
unclean
influences
every
where
around
them
nor
do
the
master
daughters
always
escape
severe
retributions
sometimes
come
upon
him
for
the
wrongs
he
does
to
the
daughters
of
the
slaves
the
white
daughters
early
hear
their
parents
quarrelling
about
some
female
slave
their
curiosity
is
excited
and
they
soon
learn
the
cause
they
are
attended
by
the
young
slave
girls
whom
their
father
has
corrupted
and
they
hear
such
talk
as
should
never
meet
youthful
ears
or
any
other
ears
they
know
that
the
woman
slaves
are
subject
to
their
father
authority
in
all
things
and
in
some
cases
they
exercise
the
same
authority
over
the
men
slaves
i
have
myself
seen
the
master
of
such
a
household
whose
head
was
bowed
down
in
shame
for
it
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
that
his
daughter
had
selected
one
of
the
meanest
slaves
on
his
plantation
to
be
the
father
of
his
first
grandchild
she
did
not
make
her
advances
to
her
equals
nor
even
to
her
father
more
intelligent
servants
she
selected
the
most
brutalized
over
whom
her
authority
could
be
exercised
with
less
fear
of
exposure
her
father
half
frantic
with
rage
sought
to
revenge
himself
on
the
offending
black
man
but
his
daughter
foreseeing
the
storm
that
would
arise
had
given
him
free
papers
and
sent
him
out
of
the
state
in
such
cases
the
infant
is
smothered
or
sent
where
it
is
never
seen
by
any
who
know
its
history
but
if
the
white
parent
is
the
instead
of
the
mother
the
offspring
are
unblushingly
reared
for
the
market
if
they
are
girls
i
have
indicated
plainly
enough
what
will
be
their
inevitable
destiny
you
may
believe
what
i
say
for
i
write
only
that
whereof
i
know
i
was
years
in
that
cage
of
obscene
birds
i
can
testify
from
my
own
experience
and
observation
that
slavery
is
a
curse
to
the
whites
as
well
as
to
the
blacks
it
makes
white
fathers
cruel
and
sensual
the
sons
violent
and
licentious
it
contaminates
the
daughters
and
makes
the
wives
wretched
and
as
for
the
colored
race
it
needs
an
abler
pen
than
mine
to
describe
the
extremity
of
their
sufferings
the
depth
of
their
degradation
yet
few
slaveholders
seem
to
be
aware
of
the
widespread
moral
ruin
occasioned
by
this
wicked
system
their
talk
is
of
blighted
cotton
crops
not
of
the
blight
on
their
children
souls
if
you
want
to
be
fully
convinced
of
the
abominations
of
slavery
go
on
a
southern
plantation
and
call
yourself
a
negro
trader
then
there
will
be
no
concealment
and
you
will
see
and
hear
things
that
will
seem
to
you
impossible
among
human
beings
with
immortal
souls
x
a
perilous
passage
in
the
slave
girl
life
after
my
lover
went
away
flint
contrived
a
new
plan
he
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
my
fear
of
my
mistress
was
his
greatest
obstacle
in
the
blandest
tones
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
build
a
small
house
for
me
in
a
secluded
place
four
miles
away
from
the
town
i
shuddered
but
i
was
constrained
to
listen
while
he
talked
of
his
intention
to
give
me
a
home
of
my
own
and
to
make
a
lady
of
me
hitherto
i
had
escaped
my
dreaded
fate
by
being
in
the
midst
of
people
my
grandmother
had
already
had
high
words
with
my
master
about
me
she
had
told
him
pretty
plainly
what
she
thought
of
his
character
and
there
was
considerable
gossip
in
the
neighborhood
about
our
affairs
to
which
the
jealousy
of
flint
contributed
not
a
little
when
my
master
said
he
was
going
to
build
a
house
for
me
and
that
he
could
do
it
with
little
trouble
and
expense
i
was
in
hopes
something
would
happen
to
frustrate
his
scheme
but
i
soon
heard
that
the
house
was
actually
begun
i
vowed
before
my
maker
that
i
would
never
enter
it
i
had
rather
toil
on
the
plantation
from
dawn
till
dark
i
had
rather
live
and
die
in
jail
than
drag
on
from
day
to
day
through
such
a
living
death
i
was
determined
that
the
master
whom
i
so
hated
and
loathed
who
had
blighted
the
prospects
of
my
youth
and
made
my
life
a
desert
should
not
after
my
long
struggle
with
him
succeed
at
last
in
trampling
his
victim
under
his
feet
i
would
do
any
thing
every
thing
for
the
sake
of
defeating
him
what
i
do
i
thought
and
thought
till
i
became
desperate
and
made
a
plunge
into
the
abyss
and
now
reader
i
come
to
a
period
in
my
unhappy
life
which
i
would
gladly
forget
if
i
could
the
remembrance
fills
me
with
sorrow
and
shame
it
pains
me
to
tell
you
of
it
but
i
have
promised
to
tell
you
the
truth
and
i
will
do
it
honestly
let
it
cost
me
what
it
may
i
will
not
try
to
screen
myself
behind
the
plea
of
compulsion
from
a
master
for
it
was
not
so
neither
can
i
plead
ignorance
or
thoughtlessness
for
years
my
master
had
done
his
utmost
to
pollute
my
mind
with
foul
images
and
to
destroy
the
pure
principles
inculcated
by
my
grandmother
and
the
good
mistress
of
my
childhood
the
influences
of
slavery
had
had
the
same
effect
on
me
that
they
had
on
other
young
girls
they
had
made
me
prematurely
knowing
concerning
the
evil
ways
of
the
world
i
knew
what
i
did
and
i
did
it
with
deliberate
calculation
but
o
ye
happy
women
whose
purity
has
been
sheltered
from
childhood
who
have
been
free
to
choose
the
objects
of
your
affection
whose
homes
are
protected
by
law
do
not
judge
the
poor
desolate
slave
girl
too
severely
if
slavery
had
been
abolished
i
also
could
have
married
the
man
of
my
choice
i
could
have
had
a
home
shielded
by
the
laws
and
i
should
have
been
spared
the
painful
task
of
confessing
what
i
am
now
about
to
relate
but
all
my
prospects
had
been
blighted
by
slavery
i
wanted
to
keep
myself
pure
and
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
i
tried
hard
to
preserve
my
but
i
was
struggling
alone
in
the
powerful
grasp
of
the
demon
slavery
and
the
monster
proved
too
strong
for
me
i
felt
as
if
i
was
forsaken
by
god
and
man
as
if
all
my
efforts
must
be
frustrated
and
i
became
reckless
in
my
despair
i
have
told
you
that
flint
persecutions
and
his
wife
jealousy
had
given
rise
to
some
gossip
in
the
neighborhood
among
others
it
chanced
that
a
white
unmarried
gentleman
had
obtained
some
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
in
which
i
was
placed
he
knew
my
grandmother
and
often
spoke
to
me
in
the
street
he
became
interested
for
me
and
asked
questions
about
my
master
which
i
answered
in
part
he
expressed
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
and
a
wish
to
aid
me
he
constantly
sought
opportunities
to
see
me
and
wrote
to
me
frequently
i
was
a
poor
slave
girl
only
fifteen
years
old
so
much
attention
from
a
superior
person
was
of
course
flattering
for
human
nature
is
the
same
in
all
i
also
felt
grateful
for
his
sympathy
and
encouraged
by
his
kind
words
it
seemed
to
me
a
great
thing
to
have
such
a
friend
by
degrees
a
more
tender
feeling
crept
into
my
heart
he
was
an
educated
and
eloquent
gentleman
too
eloquent
alas
for
the
poor
slave
girl
who
trusted
in
him
of
course
i
saw
whither
all
this
was
tending
i
knew
the
impassable
gulf
between
us
but
to
be
an
object
of
interest
to
a
man
who
is
not
married
and
who
is
not
her
master
is
agreeable
to
the
pride
and
feelings
of
a
slave
if
her
miserable
situation
has
left
her
any
pride
or
sentiment
it
seems
less
degrading
to
give
one
self
than
to
submit
to
compulsion
there
is
something
akin
to
freedom
in
having
a
lover
who
has
no
control
over
you
except
that
which
he
gains
by
kindness
and
attachment
a
master
may
treat
you
as
rudely
as
he
pleases
and
you
dare
not
speak
moreover
the
wrong
does
not
seem
so
great
with
an
unmarried
man
as
with
one
who
has
a
wife
to
be
made
unhappy
there
may
be
sophistry
in
all
this
but
the
condition
of
a
slave
confuses
all
principles
of
morality
and
in
fact
renders
the
practice
of
them
impossible
when
i
found
that
my
master
had
actually
begun
to
build
the
lonely
cottage
other
feelings
mixed
with
those
i
have
described
revenge
and
calculations
of
interest
were
added
to
flattered
vanity
and
sincere
gratitude
for
kindness
i
knew
nothing
would
enrage
flint
so
much
as
to
know
that
i
favored
another
and
it
was
something
to
triumph
over
my
tyrant
even
in
that
small
way
i
thought
he
would
revenge
himself
by
selling
me
and
i
was
sure
my
friend
sands
would
buy
me
he
was
a
man
of
more
generosity
and
feeling
than
my
master
and
i
thought
my
freedom
could
be
easily
obtained
from
him
the
crisis
of
my
fate
now
came
so
near
that
i
was
desperate
i
shuddered
to
think
of
being
the
mother
of
children
that
should
be
owned
by
my
old
tyrant
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
a
new
fancy
took
him
his
victims
were
sold
far
off
to
get
rid
of
them
especially
if
they
had
children
i
had
seen
several
women
sold
with
babies
at
the
breast
he
never
allowed
his
offspring
by
slaves
to
remain
long
in
sight
of
himself
and
his
wife
of
a
man
who
was
not
my
master
i
could
ask
to
have
my
children
well
supported
and
in
this
case
i
felt
confident
i
should
obtain
the
boon
i
also
felt
quite
sure
that
they
would
be
made
free
with
all
these
thoughts
revolving
in
my
mind
and
seeing
no
other
way
of
escaping
the
doom
i
so
much
dreaded
i
made
a
headlong
plunge
pity
me
and
pardon
me
o
virtuous
reader
you
never
knew
what
it
is
to
be
a
slave
to
be
entirely
unprotected
by
law
or
custom
to
have
the
laws
reduce
you
to
the
condition
of
a
chattel
entirely
subject
to
the
will
of
another
you
never
exhausted
your
ingenuity
in
avoiding
the
snares
and
eluding
the
power
of
a
hated
tyrant
you
never
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
and
trembled
within
hearing
of
his
voice
i
know
i
did
wrong
no
one
can
feel
it
more
sensibly
than
i
do
the
painful
and
humiliating
memory
will
haunt
me
to
my
dying
day
still
in
looking
back
calmly
on
the
events
of
my
life
i
feel
that
the
slave
woman
ought
not
to
be
judged
by
the
same
standard
as
others
the
months
passed
on
i
had
many
unhappy
hours
i
secretly
mourned
over
the
sorrow
i
was
bringing
on
my
grandmother
who
had
so
tried
to
shield
me
from
harm
i
knew
that
i
was
the
greatest
comfort
of
her
old
age
and
that
it
was
a
source
of
pride
to
her
that
i
had
not
degraded
myself
like
most
of
the
slaves
i
wanted
to
confess
to
her
that
i
was
no
longer
worthy
of
her
love
but
i
could
not
utter
the
dreaded
words
as
for
flint
i
had
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
triumph
in
the
thought
of
telling
from
time
to
time
he
told
me
of
his
intended
arrangements
and
i
was
silent
at
last
he
came
and
told
me
the
cottage
was
completed
and
ordered
me
to
go
to
it
i
told
him
i
would
never
enter
it
he
said
i
have
heard
enough
of
such
talk
as
that
you
shall
go
if
you
are
carried
by
force
and
you
shall
remain
there
i
replied
i
will
never
go
there
in
a
few
months
i
shall
be
a
mother
he
stood
and
looked
at
me
in
dumb
amazement
and
left
the
house
without
a
word
i
thought
i
should
be
happy
in
my
triumph
over
him
but
now
that
the
truth
was
out
and
my
relatives
would
hear
of
it
i
felt
wretched
humble
as
were
their
circumstances
they
had
pride
in
my
good
character
now
how
could
i
look
at
them
in
the
face
my
was
gone
i
had
resolved
that
i
would
be
virtuous
though
i
was
a
slave
i
had
said
let
the
storm
beat
i
will
brave
it
till
i
die
and
now
how
humiliated
i
felt
i
went
to
my
grandmother
my
lips
moved
to
make
confession
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
i
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
at
her
door
and
began
to
sew
i
think
she
saw
something
unusual
was
the
matter
with
me
the
mother
of
slaves
is
very
watchful
she
knows
there
is
no
security
for
her
children
after
they
have
entered
their
teens
she
lives
in
daily
expectation
of
trouble
this
leads
to
many
questions
if
the
girl
is
of
a
sensitive
nature
timidity
keeps
her
from
answering
truthfully
and
this
course
has
a
tendency
to
drive
her
from
maternal
counsels
presently
in
came
my
mistress
like
a
mad
woman
and
accused
me
concerning
her
husband
my
grandmother
whose
suspicions
had
been
previously
awakened
believed
what
she
said
she
exclaimed
o
linda
has
it
come
to
this
i
had
rather
see
you
dead
than
to
see
you
as
you
now
are
you
are
a
disgrace
to
your
dead
mother
she
tore
from
my
fingers
my
mother
wedding
ring
and
her
silver
thimble
go
away
she
exclaimed
and
never
come
to
my
house
again
her
reproaches
fell
so
hot
and
heavy
that
they
left
me
no
chance
to
answer
bitter
tears
such
as
the
eyes
never
shed
but
once
were
my
only
answer
i
rose
from
my
seat
but
fell
back
again
sobbing
she
did
not
speak
to
me
but
the
tears
were
running
down
her
furrowed
cheeks
and
they
scorched
me
like
fire
she
had
always
been
so
kind
to
me
kind
how
i
longed
to
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
tell
her
all
the
truth
but
she
had
ordered
me
to
go
and
never
to
come
there
again
after
a
few
minutes
i
mustered
strength
and
started
to
obey
her
with
what
feelings
did
i
now
close
that
little
gate
which
i
used
to
open
with
such
an
eager
hand
in
my
childhood
it
closed
upon
me
with
a
sound
i
never
heard
before
where
could
i
go
i
was
afraid
to
return
to
my
master
i
walked
on
recklessly
not
caring
where
i
went
or
what
would
become
of
me
when
i
had
gone
four
or
five
miles
fatigue
compelled
me
to
stop
i
sat
down
on
the
stump
of
an
old
tree
the
stars
were
shining
through
the
boughs
above
me
how
they
mocked
me
with
their
bright
calm
light
the
hours
passed
by
and
as
i
sat
there
alone
a
chilliness
and
deadly
sickness
came
over
me
i
sank
on
the
ground
my
mind
was
full
of
horrid
thoughts
i
prayed
to
die
but
the
prayer
was
not
answered
at
last
with
great
effort
i
roused
myself
and
walked
some
distance
further
to
the
house
of
a
woman
who
had
been
a
friend
of
my
mother
when
i
told
her
why
i
was
there
she
spoke
soothingly
to
me
but
i
could
not
be
comforted
i
thought
i
could
bear
my
shame
if
i
could
only
be
reconciled
to
my
grandmother
i
longed
to
open
my
heart
to
her
i
thought
if
she
could
know
the
real
state
of
the
case
and
all
i
had
been
bearing
for
years
she
would
perhaps
judge
me
less
harshly
my
friend
advised
me
to
send
for
her
i
did
so
but
days
of
agonizing
suspense
passed
before
she
came
had
she
utterly
forsaken
me
no
she
came
at
last
i
knelt
before
her
and
told
her
the
things
that
had
poisoned
my
life
how
long
i
had
been
persecuted
that
i
saw
no
way
of
escape
and
in
an
hour
of
extremity
i
had
become
desperate
she
listened
in
silence
i
told
her
i
would
bear
any
thing
and
do
any
thing
if
in
time
i
had
hopes
of
obtaining
her
forgiveness
i
begged
of
her
to
pity
me
for
my
dead
mother
sake
and
she
did
pity
me
she
did
not
say
i
forgive
you
but
she
looked
at
me
lovingly
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
she
laid
her
old
hand
gently
on
my
head
and
murmured
poor
child
poor
child
xi
the
new
tie
to
life
i
returned
to
my
good
grandmother
house
she
had
an
interview
with
sands
when
she
asked
him
why
he
could
not
have
left
her
one
ewe
lamb
whether
there
were
not
plenty
of
slaves
who
did
not
care
about
character
he
made
no
answer
but
he
spoke
kind
and
encouraging
words
he
promised
to
care
for
my
child
and
to
buy
me
be
the
conditions
what
they
might
i
had
not
seen
flint
for
five
days
i
had
never
seen
him
since
i
made
the
avowal
to
him
he
talked
of
the
disgrace
i
had
brought
on
myself
how
i
had
sinned
against
my
master
and
mortified
my
old
grandmother
he
intimated
that
if
i
had
accepted
his
proposals
he
as
a
physician
could
have
saved
me
from
exposure
he
even
condescended
to
pity
me
could
he
have
offered
wormwood
more
bitter
he
whose
persecutions
had
been
the
cause
of
my
sin
linda
said
he
though
you
have
been
criminal
towards
me
i
feel
for
you
and
i
can
pardon
you
if
you
obey
my
wishes
tell
me
whether
the
fellow
you
wanted
to
marry
is
the
father
of
your
child
if
you
deceive
me
you
shall
feel
the
fires
of
hell
i
did
not
feel
as
proud
as
i
had
done
my
strongest
weapon
with
him
was
gone
i
was
lowered
in
my
own
estimation
and
had
resolved
to
bear
his
abuse
in
silence
but
when
he
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
lover
who
had
always
treated
me
honorably
when
i
remembered
that
but
for
i
might
have
been
a
virtuous
free
and
happy
wife
i
lost
my
patience
i
have
sinned
against
god
and
myself
i
replied
but
not
against
you
he
clinched
his
teeth
and
muttered
curse
you
he
came
towards
me
with
rage
and
exclaimed
you
obstinate
girl
i
could
grind
your
bones
to
powder
you
have
thrown
yourself
away
on
some
worthless
rascal
you
are
and
have
been
easily
persuaded
by
those
who
do
care
a
straw
for
you
the
future
will
settle
accounts
between
us
you
are
blinded
now
but
hereafter
you
will
be
convinced
that
your
master
was
your
best
friend
my
lenity
towards
you
is
a
proof
of
it
i
might
have
punished
you
in
many
ways
i
might
have
whipped
till
you
fell
dead
under
the
lash
but
i
wanted
you
to
live
i
would
have
bettered
your
condition
others
can
not
do
it
you
are
my
slave
your
mistress
disgusted
by
your
conduct
forbids
you
to
return
to
the
house
therefore
i
leave
you
here
for
the
present
but
i
shall
see
you
often
i
will
call
he
came
with
frowning
brows
that
showed
a
dissatisfied
state
of
mind
after
asking
about
my
health
he
inquired
whether
my
board
was
paid
and
who
visited
me
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
neglected
his
duty
that
as
a
physician
there
were
certain
things
that
he
ought
to
have
explained
to
me
then
followed
talk
such
as
would
have
made
the
most
shameless
blush
he
ordered
me
to
stand
up
before
him
i
obeyed
i
command
you
said
he
to
tell
me
whether
the
father
of
your
child
is
white
or
black
i
hesitated
answer
me
this
instant
he
exclaimed
i
did
answer
he
sprang
upon
me
like
a
wolf
and
grabbed
my
arm
as
if
he
would
have
broken
it
do
you
love
him
said
he
in
a
hissing
tone
i
am
thankful
that
i
do
not
despise
him
i
replied
he
raised
his
hand
to
strike
me
but
it
fell
again
i
do
know
what
arrested
the
blow
he
sat
down
with
lips
tightly
compressed
at
last
he
spoke
i
came
here
said
he
to
make
you
a
friendly
proposition
but
your
ingratitude
chafes
me
beyond
endurance
you
turn
aside
all
my
good
intentions
towards
you
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
keeps
me
from
killing
you
again
he
rose
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
strike
me
but
he
resumed
on
one
condition
i
will
forgive
your
insolence
and
crime
you
must
henceforth
have
no
communication
of
any
kind
with
the
father
of
your
child
you
must
not
ask
any
thing
from
him
or
receive
any
thing
from
him
i
will
take
care
of
you
and
your
child
you
had
better
promise
this
at
once
and
not
wait
till
you
are
deserted
by
him
this
is
the
last
act
of
mercy
i
shall
show
towards
you
i
said
something
about
being
unwilling
to
have
my
child
supported
by
a
man
who
had
cursed
it
and
me
also
he
rejoined
that
a
woman
who
had
sunk
to
my
level
had
no
right
to
expect
any
thing
else
he
asked
for
the
last
time
would
i
accept
his
kindness
i
answered
that
i
would
not
very
well
said
he
then
take
the
consequences
of
your
wayward
course
never
look
to
me
for
help
you
are
my
slave
and
shall
always
be
my
slave
i
will
never
sell
you
that
you
may
depend
upon
hope
died
away
in
my
heart
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
i
had
calculated
that
in
his
rage
he
would
sell
me
to
a
and
i
knew
the
father
of
my
child
was
on
the
watch
to
buy
me
about
this
time
my
uncle
phillip
was
expected
to
return
from
a
voyage
the
day
before
his
departure
i
had
officiated
as
bridesmaid
to
a
young
friend
my
heart
was
then
ill
at
ease
but
my
smiling
countenance
did
not
betray
it
only
a
year
had
passed
but
what
fearful
changes
it
had
wrought
my
heart
had
grown
gray
in
misery
lives
that
flash
in
sunshine
and
lives
that
are
born
in
tears
receive
their
hue
from
circumstances
none
of
us
know
what
a
year
may
bring
forth
i
felt
no
joy
when
they
told
me
my
uncle
had
come
he
wanted
to
see
me
though
he
knew
what
had
happened
i
shrank
from
him
at
first
but
at
last
consented
that
he
should
come
to
my
room
he
received
me
as
he
always
had
done
o
how
my
heart
smote
me
when
i
felt
his
tears
on
my
burning
cheeks
the
words
of
my
grandmother
came
to
my
mind
perhaps
your
mother
and
father
are
taken
from
the
evil
days
to
come
my
disappointed
heart
could
now
praise
god
that
it
was
so
but
why
thought
i
did
my
relatives
ever
cherish
hopes
for
me
what
was
there
to
save
me
from
the
usual
fate
of
slave
girls
many
more
beautiful
and
more
intelligent
than
i
had
experienced
a
similar
fate
or
a
far
worse
one
how
could
they
hope
that
i
should
escape
my
uncle
stay
was
short
and
i
was
not
sorry
for
it
i
was
too
ill
in
mind
and
body
to
enjoy
my
friends
as
i
had
done
for
some
weeks
i
was
unable
to
leave
my
bed
i
could
not
have
any
doctor
but
my
master
and
i
would
not
have
him
sent
for
at
last
alarmed
by
my
increasing
illness
they
sent
for
him
i
was
very
weak
and
nervous
and
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
i
began
to
scream
they
told
him
my
state
was
very
critical
he
had
no
wish
to
hasten
me
out
of
the
world
and
he
withdrew
when
my
babe
was
born
they
said
it
was
premature
it
weighed
only
four
pounds
but
god
let
it
live
i
heard
the
doctor
say
i
could
not
survive
till
morning
i
had
often
prayed
for
death
but
now
i
did
not
want
to
die
unless
my
child
could
die
too
many
weeks
passed
before
i
was
able
to
leave
my
bed
i
was
a
mere
wreck
of
my
former
self
for
a
year
there
was
scarcely
a
day
when
i
was
free
from
chills
and
fever
my
babe
also
was
sickly
his
little
limbs
were
often
racked
with
pain
flint
continued
his
visits
to
look
after
my
health
and
he
did
not
fail
to
remind
me
that
my
child
was
an
addition
to
his
stock
of
slaves
i
felt
too
feeble
to
dispute
with
him
and
listened
to
his
remarks
in
silence
his
visits
were
less
frequent
but
his
busy
spirit
could
not
remain
quiet
he
employed
my
brother
in
his
office
and
he
was
made
the
medium
of
frequent
notes
and
messages
to
me
william
was
a
bright
lad
and
of
much
use
to
the
doctor
he
had
learned
to
put
up
medicines
to
leech
cup
and
bleed
he
had
taught
himself
to
read
and
spell
i
was
proud
of
my
brother
and
the
old
doctor
suspected
as
much
one
day
when
i
had
not
seen
him
for
several
weeks
i
heard
his
steps
approaching
the
door
i
dreaded
the
encounter
and
hid
myself
he
inquired
for
me
of
course
but
i
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
went
to
his
office
and
despatched
william
with
a
note
the
color
mounted
to
my
brother
face
when
he
gave
it
to
me
and
he
said
do
you
hate
me
linda
for
bringing
you
these
things
i
told
him
i
could
not
blame
him
he
was
a
slave
and
obliged
to
obey
his
will
the
note
ordered
me
to
come
to
his
office
i
went
he
demanded
to
know
where
i
was
when
he
called
i
told
him
i
was
at
home
he
flew
into
a
passion
and
said
he
knew
better
then
he
launched
out
upon
his
usual
themes
my
crimes
against
him
and
my
ingratitude
for
his
forbearance
the
laws
were
laid
down
to
me
anew
and
i
was
dismissed
i
felt
humiliated
that
my
brother
should
stand
by
and
listen
to
such
language
as
would
be
addressed
only
to
a
slave
poor
boy
he
was
powerless
to
defend
me
but
i
saw
the
tears
which
he
vainly
strove
to
keep
back
the
manifestation
of
feeling
irritated
the
doctor
william
could
do
nothing
to
please
him
one
morning
he
did
not
arrive
at
the
office
so
early
as
usual
and
that
circumstance
afforded
his
master
an
opportunity
to
vent
his
spleen
he
was
put
in
jail
the
next
day
my
brother
sent
a
trader
to
the
doctor
with
a
request
to
be
sold
his
master
was
greatly
incensed
at
what
he
called
his
insolence
he
said
he
had
put
him
there
to
reflect
upon
his
bad
conduct
and
he
certainly
was
not
giving
any
evidence
of
repentance
for
two
days
he
harassed
himself
to
find
somebody
to
do
his
office
work
but
every
thing
went
wrong
without
william
he
was
released
and
ordered
to
take
his
old
stand
with
many
threats
if
he
was
not
careful
about
his
future
behavior
as
the
months
passed
on
my
boy
improved
in
health
when
he
was
a
year
old
they
called
him
beautiful
the
little
vine
was
taking
deep
root
in
my
existence
though
its
clinging
fondness
excited
a
mixture
of
love
and
pain
when
i
was
most
sorely
oppressed
i
found
a
solace
in
his
smiles
i
loved
to
watch
his
infant
slumbers
but
always
there
was
a
dark
cloud
over
my
enjoyment
i
could
never
forget
that
he
was
a
slave
sometimes
i
wished
that
he
might
die
in
infancy
god
tried
me
my
darling
became
very
ill
the
bright
eyes
grew
dull
and
the
little
feet
and
hands
were
so
icy
cold
that
i
thought
death
had
already
touched
them
i
had
prayed
for
his
death
but
never
so
earnestly
as
i
now
prayed
for
his
life
and
my
prayer
was
heard
alas
what
mockery
it
is
for
a
slave
mother
to
try
to
pray
back
her
dying
child
to
life
death
is
better
than
slavery
it
was
a
sad
thought
that
i
had
no
name
to
give
my
child
his
father
caressed
him
and
treated
him
kindly
whenever
he
had
a
chance
to
see
him
he
was
not
unwilling
that
he
should
bear
his
name
but
he
had
no
legal
claim
to
it
and
if
i
had
bestowed
it
upon
him
my
master
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
new
crime
a
new
piece
of
insolence
and
would
perhaps
revenge
it
on
the
boy
o
the
serpent
of
slavery
has
many
and
poisonous
fangs
xii
fear
of
insurrection
not
far
from
this
time
nat
turner
insurrection
broke
out
and
the
news
threw
our
town
into
great
commotion
strange
that
they
should
be
alarmed
when
their
slaves
were
so
contented
and
happy
but
so
it
was
it
was
always
the
custom
to
have
a
muster
every
year
on
that
occasion
every
white
man
shouldered
his
musket
the
citizens
and
the
country
gentlemen
wore
military
uniforms
the
poor
whites
took
their
places
in
the
ranks
in
dress
some
without
shoes
some
without
hats
this
grand
occasion
had
already
passed
and
when
the
slaves
were
told
there
was
to
be
another
muster
they
were
surprised
and
rejoiced
poor
creatures
they
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
holiday
i
was
informed
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
imparted
it
to
the
few
i
could
trust
most
gladly
would
i
have
proclaimed
it
to
every
slave
but
i
dared
not
all
could
not
be
relied
on
mighty
is
the
power
of
the
torturing
lash
by
sunrise
people
were
pouring
in
from
every
quarter
within
twenty
miles
of
the
town
i
knew
the
houses
were
to
be
searched
and
i
expected
it
would
be
done
by
country
bullies
and
the
poor
whites
i
knew
nothing
annoyed
them
so
much
as
to
see
colored
people
living
in
comfort
and
respectability
so
i
made
arrangements
for
them
with
especial
care
i
arranged
every
thing
in
my
grandmother
house
as
neatly
as
possible
i
put
white
quilts
on
the
beds
and
decorated
some
of
the
rooms
with
flowers
when
all
was
arranged
i
sat
down
at
the
window
to
watch
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
it
rested
on
a
motley
crowd
of
soldiers
drums
and
fifes
were
discoursing
martial
music
the
men
were
divided
into
companies
of
sixteen
each
headed
by
a
captain
orders
were
given
and
the
wild
scouts
rushed
in
every
direction
wherever
a
colored
face
was
to
be
found
it
was
a
grand
opportunity
for
the
low
whites
who
had
no
negroes
of
their
own
to
scourge
they
exulted
in
such
a
chance
to
exercise
a
little
brief
authority
and
show
their
subserviency
to
the
slaveholders
not
reflecting
that
the
power
which
trampled
on
the
colored
people
also
kept
themselves
in
poverty
ignorance
and
moral
degradation
those
who
never
witnessed
such
scenes
can
hardly
believe
what
i
know
was
inflicted
at
this
time
on
innocent
men
women
and
children
against
whom
there
was
not
the
slightest
ground
for
suspicion
colored
people
and
slaves
who
lived
in
remote
parts
of
the
town
suffered
in
an
especial
manner
in
some
cases
the
searchers
scattered
powder
and
shot
among
their
clothes
and
then
sent
other
parties
to
find
them
and
bring
them
forward
as
proof
that
they
were
plotting
insurrection
every
where
men
women
and
children
were
whipped
till
the
blood
stood
in
puddles
at
their
feet
some
received
five
hundred
lashes
others
were
tied
hands
and
feet
and
tortured
with
a
bucking
paddle
which
blisters
the
skin
terribly
the
dwellings
of
the
colored
people
unless
they
happened
to
be
protected
by
some
influential
white
person
who
was
nigh
at
hand
were
robbed
of
clothing
and
every
thing
else
the
marauders
thought
worth
carrying
away
all
day
long
these
unfeeling
wretches
went
round
like
a
troop
of
demons
terrifying
and
tormenting
the
helpless
at
night
they
formed
themselves
into
patrol
bands
and
went
wherever
they
chose
among
the
colored
people
acting
out
their
brutal
will
many
women
hid
themselves
in
woods
and
swamps
to
keep
out
of
their
way
if
any
of
the
husbands
or
fathers
told
of
these
outrages
they
were
tied
up
to
the
public
whipping
post
and
cruelly
scourged
for
telling
lies
about
white
men
the
consternation
was
universal
no
two
people
that
had
the
slightest
tinge
of
color
in
their
faces
dared
to
be
seen
talking
together
i
entertained
no
positive
fears
about
our
household
because
we
were
in
the
midst
of
white
families
who
would
protect
us
we
were
ready
to
receive
the
soldiers
whenever
they
came
it
was
not
long
before
we
heard
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
sound
of
voices
the
door
was
rudely
pushed
open
and
in
they
tumbled
like
a
pack
of
hungry
wolves
they
snatched
at
every
thing
within
their
reach
every
box
trunk
closet
and
corner
underwent
a
thorough
examination
a
box
in
one
of
the
drawers
containing
some
silver
change
was
eagerly
pounced
upon
when
i
stepped
forward
to
take
it
from
them
one
of
the
soldiers
turned
and
said
angrily
what
d
foller
us
fur
d
white
folks
is
come
to
steal
i
replied
you
have
come
to
search
but
you
have
searched
that
box
and
i
will
take
it
if
you
please
at
that
moment
i
saw
a
white
gentleman
who
was
friendly
to
us
and
i
called
to
him
and
asked
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
come
in
and
stay
till
the
search
was
over
he
readily
complied
his
entrance
into
the
house
brought
in
the
captain
of
the
company
whose
business
it
was
to
guard
the
outside
of
the
house
and
see
that
none
of
the
inmates
left
it
this
officer
was
litch
the
wealthy
slaveholder
whom
i
mentioned
in
the
account
of
neighboring
planters
as
being
notorious
for
his
cruelty
he
felt
above
soiling
his
hands
with
the
search
he
merely
gave
orders
and
if
a
bit
of
writing
was
discovered
it
was
carried
to
him
by
his
ignorant
followers
who
were
unable
to
read
my
grandmother
had
a
large
trunk
of
bedding
and
table
cloths
when
that
was
opened
there
was
a
great
shout
of
surprise
and
one
exclaimed
the
damned
niggers

dis
sheet
an
table
clarf
my
grandmother
emboldened
by
the
presence
of
our
white
protector
said

coat

feel
mighty
gran

all
them

white
folks

all
his
remarks
were
interrupted
by
a
chorus
of
voices
shouting
we
got
we
got
dis
yaller
gal
got
letters
there
was
a
general
rush
for
the
supposed
letter
which
upon
examination
proved
to
be
some
verses
written
to
me
by
a
friend
in
packing
away
my
things
i
had
overlooked
them
when
their
captain
informed
them
of
their
contents
they
seemed
much
disappointed
he
inquired
of
me
who
wrote
them
i
told
him
it
was
one
of
my
friends
can
you
read
them
he
asked
when
i
told
him
i
could
he
swore
and
raved
and
tore
the
paper
into
bits
bring
me
all
your
letters
said
he
in
commanding
tone
i
told
him
i
had
none
do
be
afraid
he
continued
in
an
insinuating
way
bring
them
all
to
me
nobody
shall
do
you
any
harm
seeing
i
did
not
move
to
obey
him
his
pleasant
tone
changed
to
oaths
and
threats
who
writes
to
you
half
free
niggers
inquired
he
i
replied
o
no
most
of
my
letters
are
from
white
people
some
request
me
to
burn
them
after
they
are
read
and
some
i
destroy
without
reading
an
exclamation
of
surprise
from
some
of
the
company
put
a
stop
to
our
conversation
some
silver
spoons
which
ornamented
an
buffet
had
just
been
discovered
my
grandmother
was
in
the
habit
of
preserving
fruit
for
many
ladies
in
the
town
and
of
preparing
suppers
for
parties
consequently
she
had
many
jars
of
preserves
the
closet
that
contained
these
was
next
invaded
and
the
contents
tasted
one
of
them
who
was
helping
himself
freely
tapped
his
neighbor
on
the
shoulder
and
said
wal
done
do
wonder
de
niggers
want
to
kill
all
de
white
folks
when
dey
live
on
meaning
preserves
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
take
the
jar
saying
you
were
not
sent
here
to
search
for
sweetmeats
and
what
we
sent
for
said
the
captain
bristling
up
to
me
i
evaded
the
question
the
search
of
the
house
was
completed
and
nothing
found
to
condemn
us
they
next
proceeded
to
the
garden
and
knocked
about
every
bush
and
vine
with
no
better
success
the
captain
called
his
men
together
and
after
a
short
consultation
the
order
to
march
was
given
as
they
passed
out
of
the
gate
the
captain
turned
back
and
pronounced
a
malediction
on
the
house
he
said
it
ought
to
be
burned
to
the
ground
and
each
of
its
inmates
receive
lashes
we
came
out
of
this
affair
very
fortunately
not
losing
any
thing
except
some
wearing
apparel
towards
evening
the
turbulence
increased
the
soldiers
stimulated
by
drink
committed
still
greater
cruelties
shrieks
and
shouts
continually
rent
the
air
not
daring
to
go
to
the
door
i
peeped
under
the
window
curtain
i
saw
a
mob
dragging
along
a
number
of
colored
people
each
white
man
with
his
musket
upraised
threatening
instant
death
if
they
did
not
stop
their
shrieks
among
the
prisoners
was
a
respectable
old
colored
minister
they
had
found
a
few
parcels
of
shot
in
his
house
which
his
wife
had
for
years
used
to
balance
her
scales
for
this
they
were
going
to
shoot
him
on
court
house
green
what
a
spectacle
was
that
for
a
civilized
country
a
rabble
staggering
under
intoxication
assuming
to
be
the
administrators
of
justice
the
better
class
of
the
community
exerted
their
influence
to
save
the
innocent
persecuted
people
and
in
several
instances
they
succeeded
by
keeping
them
shut
up
in
jail
till
the
excitement
abated
at
last
the
white
citizens
found
that
their
own
property
was
not
safe
from
the
lawless
rabble
they
had
summoned
to
protect
them
they
rallied
the
drunken
swarm
drove
them
back
into
the
country
and
set
a
guard
over
the
town
the
next
day
the
town
patrols
were
commissioned
to
search
colored
people
that
lived
out
of
the
city
and
the
most
shocking
outrages
were
committed
with
perfect
impunity
every
day
for
a
fortnight
if
i
looked
out
i
saw
horsemen
with
some
poor
panting
negro
tied
to
their
saddles
and
compelled
by
the
lash
to
keep
up
with
their
speed
till
they
arrived
at
the
jail
yard
those
who
had
been
whipped
too
unmercifully
to
walk
were
washed
with
brine
tossed
into
a
cart
and
carried
to
jail
one
black
man
who
had
not
fortitude
to
endure
scourging
promised
to
give
information
about
the
conspiracy
but
it
turned
out
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
he
had
not
even
heard
the
name
of
nat
turner
the
poor
fellow
had
however
made
up
a
story
which
augmented
his
own
sufferings
and
those
of
the
colored
people
the
day
patrol
continued
for
some
weeks
and
at
sundown
a
night
guard
was
substituted
nothing
at
all
was
proved
against
the
colored
people
bond
or
free
the
wrath
of
the
slaveholders
was
somewhat
appeased
by
the
capture
of
nat
turner
the
imprisoned
were
released
the
slaves
were
sent
to
their
masters
and
the
free
were
permitted
to
return
to
their
ravaged
homes
visiting
was
strictly
forbidden
on
the
plantations
the
slaves
begged
the
privilege
of
again
meeting
at
their
little
church
in
the
woods
with
their
burying
ground
around
it
it
was
built
by
the
colored
people
and
they
had
no
higher
happiness
than
to
meet
there
and
sing
hymns
together
and
pour
out
their
hearts
in
spontaneous
prayer
their
request
was
denied
and
the
church
was
demolished
they
were
permitted
to
attend
the
white
churches
a
certain
portion
of
the
galleries
being
appropriated
to
their
use
there
when
every
body
else
had
partaken
of
the
communion
and
the
benediction
had
been
pronounced
the
minister
said
come
down
now
my
colored
friends
they
obeyed
the
summons
and
partook
of
the
bread
and
wine
in
commemoration
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
who
said
god
is
your
father
and
all
ye
are
brethren
xiii
the
church
and
slavery
after
the
alarm
caused
by
nat
turner
insurrection
had
subsided
the
slaveholders
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
well
to
give
the
slaves
enough
of
religious
instruction
to
keep
them
from
murdering
their
masters
the
episcopal
clergyman
offered
to
hold
a
separate
service
on
sundays
for
their
benefit
his
colored
members
were
very
few
and
also
very
respectable
a
fact
which
i
presume
had
some
weight
with
him
the
difficulty
was
to
decide
on
a
suitable
place
for
them
to
worship
the
methodist
and
baptist
churches
admitted
them
in
the
afternoon
but
their
carpets
and
cushions
were
not
so
costly
as
those
at
the
episcopal
church
it
was
at
last
decided
that
they
should
meet
at
the
house
of
a
free
colored
man
who
was
a
member
i
was
invited
to
attend
because
i
could
read
sunday
evening
came
and
trusting
to
the
cover
of
night
i
ventured
out
i
rarely
ventured
out
by
daylight
for
i
always
went
with
fear
expecting
at
every
turn
to
encounter
flint
who
was
sure
to
turn
me
back
or
order
me
to
his
office
to
inquire
where
i
got
my
bonnet
or
some
other
article
of
dress
when
the
rev
pike
came
there
were
some
twenty
persons
present
the
reverend
gentleman
knelt
in
prayer
then
seated
himself
and
requested
all
present
who
could
read
to
open
their
books
while
he
gave
out
the
portions
he
wished
them
to
repeat
or
respond
to
his
text
was
servants
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
with
fear
and
trembling
in
singleness
of
your
heart
as
unto
christ
pious
pike
brushed
up
his
hair
till
it
stood
upright
and
in
deep
solemn
tones
began
hearken
ye
servants
give
strict
heed
unto
my
words
you
are
rebellious
sinners
your
hearts
are
filled
with
all
manner
of
evil
is
the
devil
who
tempts
you
god
is
angry
with
you
and
will
surely
punish
you
if
you
do
forsake
your
wicked
ways
you
that
live
in
town
are
eyeservants
behind
your
master
back
instead
of
serving
your
masters
faithfully
which
is
pleasing
in
the
sight
of
your
heavenly
master
you
are
idle
and
shirk
your
work
god
sees
you
you
tell
lies
god
hears
you
instead
of
being
engaged
in
worshipping
him
you
are
hidden
away
somewhere
feasting
on
your
master
substance
tossing
with
some
wicked
fortuneteller
or
cutting
cards
with
another
old
hag
your
masters
may
not
find
you
out
but
god
sees
you
and
will
punish
you
o
the
depravity
of
your
hearts
when
your
master
work
is
done
are
you
quietly
together
thinking
of
the
goodness
of
god
to
such
sinful
creatures
no
you
are
quarrelling
and
tying
up
little
bags
of
roots
to
bury
under
the
doorsteps
to
poison
each
other
with
god
sees
you
you
men
steal
away
to
every
grog
shop
to
sell
your
master
corn
that
you
may
buy
rum
to
drink
god
sees
you
you
sneak
into
the
back
streets
or
among
the
bushes
to
pitch
coppers
although
your
masters
may
not
find
you
out
god
sees
you
and
he
will
punish
you
you
must
forsake
your
sinful
ways
and
be
faithful
servants
obey
your
old
master
and
your
young
master
your
old
mistress
and
your
young
mistress
if
you
disobey
your
earthly
master
you
offend
your
heavenly
master
you
must
obey
god
commandments
when
you
go
from
here
do
stop
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
to
talk
but
go
directly
home
and
let
your
master
and
mistress
see
that
you
have
come
the
benediction
was
pronounced
we
went
home
highly
amused
at
brother
pike
gospel
teaching
and
we
determined
to
hear
him
again
i
went
the
next
sabbath
evening
and
heard
pretty
much
a
repetition
of
the
last
discourse
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
pike
informed
us
that
he
found
it
very
inconvenient
to
meet
at
the
friend
house
and
he
should
be
glad
to
see
us
every
sunday
evening
at
his
own
kitchen
i
went
home
with
the
feeling
that
i
had
heard
the
reverend
pike
for
the
last
time
some
of
his
members
repaired
to
his
house
and
found
that
the
kitchen
sported
two
tallow
candles
the
first
time
i
am
sure
since
its
present
occupant
owned
it
for
the
servants
never
had
any
thing
but
pine
knots
it
was
so
long
before
the
reverend
gentleman
descended
from
his
comfortable
parlor
that
the
slaves
left
and
went
to
enjoy
a
methodist
shout
they
never
seem
so
happy
as
when
shouting
and
singing
at
religious
meetings
many
of
them
are
sincere
and
nearer
to
the
gate
of
heaven
than
sanctimonious
pike
and
other
christians
who
see
wounded
samaritans
and
pass
by
on
the
other
side
the
slaves
generally
compose
their
own
songs
and
hymns
and
they
do
not
trouble
their
heads
much
about
the
measure
they
often
sing
the
following
verses
old
satan
is
one
busy
ole
man
he
rolls
dem
blocks
all
in
my
way
but
jesus
is
my
bosom
friend
he
rolls
dem
blocks
away
if
i
had
died
when
i
was
young
den
how
my
tongue
would
have
sung
but
i
am
ole
and
now
i
stand
a
narrow
chance
for
to
tread
dat
heavenly
land
i
well
remember
one
occasion
when
i
attended
a
methodist
class
meeting
i
went
with
a
burdened
spirit
and
happened
to
sit
next
a
poor
bereaved
mother
whose
heart
was
still
heavier
than
mine
the
class
leader
was
the
town
constable
a
man
who
bought
and
sold
slaves
who
whipped
his
brethren
and
sisters
of
the
church
at
the
public
whipping
post
in
jail
or
out
of
jail
he
was
ready
to
perform
that
christian
office
any
where
for
fifty
cents
this
brother
came
near
us
and
said
to
the
stricken
woman
sister
ca
you
tell
us
how
the
lord
deals
with
your
soul
do
you
love
him
as
you
did
formerly
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
in
piteous
tones
my
lord
and
master
help
me
my
load
is
more
than
i
can
bear
god
has
hid
himself
from
me
and
i
am
left
in
darkness
and
misery
then
striking
her
breast
she
continued
i
ca
tell
you
what
is
in
here
they
got
all
my
children
last
week
they
took
the
last
one
god
only
knows
where
they
sold
her
they
let
me
have
her
sixteen
years
and
then
o
o
pray
for
her
brothers
and
sisters
got
nothing
to
live
for
now
god
make
my
time
short
she
sat
down
quivering
in
every
limb
i
saw
that
constable
class
leader
become
crimson
in
the
face
with
suppressed
laughter
while
he
held
up
his
handkerchief
that
those
who
were
weeping
for
the
poor
woman
calamity
might
not
see
his
merriment
then
with
assumed
gravity
he
said
to
the
bereaved
mother
sister
pray
to
the
lord
that
every
dispensation
of
his
divine
will
may
be
sanctified
to
the
good
of
your
poor
needy
soul
the
congregation
struck
up
a
hymn
and
sung
as
though
they
were
as
free
as
the
birds
that
warbled
round
us
ole
satan
thought
he
had
a
mighty
aim
he
missed
my
soul
and
caught
my
sins
cry
amen
cry
amen
cry
amen
to
god
he
took
my
sins
upon
his
back
went
muttering
and
grumbling
down
to
hell
cry
amen
cry
amen
cry
amen
to
god
ole
satan
church
is
here
below
up
to
god
free
church
i
hope
to
go
cry
amen
cry
amen
cry
amen
to
god
precious
are
such
moments
to
the
poor
slaves
if
you
were
to
hear
them
at
such
times
you
might
think
they
were
happy
but
can
that
hour
of
singing
and
shouting
sustain
them
through
the
dreary
week
toiling
without
wages
under
constant
dread
of
the
lash
the
episcopal
clergyman
who
ever
since
my
earliest
recollection
had
been
a
sort
of
god
among
the
slaveholders
concluded
as
his
family
was
large
that
he
must
go
where
money
was
more
abundant
a
very
different
clergyman
took
his
place
the
change
was
very
agreeable
to
the
colored
people
who
said
god
has
sent
us
a
good
man
this
time
they
loved
him
and
their
children
followed
him
for
a
smile
or
a
kind
word
even
the
slaveholders
felt
his
influence
he
brought
to
the
rectory
five
slaves
his
wife
taught
them
to
read
and
write
and
to
be
useful
to
her
and
themselves
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
needy
slaves
around
him
he
urged
upon
his
parishioners
the
duty
of
having
a
meeting
expressly
for
them
every
sunday
with
a
sermon
adapted
to
their
comprehension
after
much
argument
and
importunity
it
was
finally
agreed
that
they
might
occupy
the
gallery
of
the
church
on
sunday
evenings
many
colored
people
hitherto
unaccustomed
to
attend
church
now
gladly
went
to
hear
the
gospel
preached
the
sermons
were
simple
and
they
understood
them
moreover
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
been
addressed
as
human
beings
it
was
not
long
before
his
white
parishioners
began
to
be
dissatisfied
he
was
accused
of
preaching
better
sermons
to
the
negroes
than
he
did
to
them
he
honestly
confessed
that
he
bestowed
more
pains
upon
those
sermons
than
upon
any
others
for
the
slaves
were
reared
in
such
ignorance
that
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
adapt
himself
to
their
comprehension
dissensions
arose
in
the
parish
some
wanted
he
should
preach
to
them
in
the
evening
and
to
the
slaves
in
the
afternoon
in
the
midst
of
these
disputings
his
wife
died
after
a
very
short
illness
her
slaves
gathered
round
her
dying
bed
in
great
sorrow
she
said
i
have
tried
to
do
you
good
and
promote
your
happiness
and
if
i
have
failed
it
has
not
been
for
want
of
interest
in
your
welfare
do
not
weep
for
me
but
prepare
for
the
new
duties
that
lie
before
you
i
leave
you
all
free
may
we
meet
in
a
better
world
her
liberated
slaves
were
sent
away
with
funds
to
establish
them
comfortably
the
colored
people
will
long
bless
the
memory
of
that
truly
christian
woman
soon
after
her
death
her
husband
preached
his
farewell
sermon
and
many
tears
were
shed
at
his
departure
several
years
after
he
passed
through
our
town
and
preached
to
his
former
congregation
in
his
afternoon
sermon
he
addressed
the
colored
people
my
friends
said
he
it
affords
me
great
happiness
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
again
for
two
years
i
have
been
striving
to
do
something
for
the
colored
people
of
my
own
parish
but
nothing
is
yet
accomplished
i
have
not
even
preached
a
sermon
to
them
try
to
live
according
to
the
word
of
god
my
friends
your
skin
is
darker
than
mine
but
god
judges
men
by
their
hearts
not
by
the
color
of
their
skins
this
was
strange
doctrine
from
a
southern
pulpit
it
was
very
offensive
to
slaveholders
they
said
he
and
his
wife
had
made
fools
of
their
slaves
and
that
he
preached
like
a
fool
to
the
negroes
i
knew
an
old
black
man
whose
piety
and
childlike
trust
in
god
were
beautiful
to
witness
at
years
old
he
joined
the
baptist
church
he
had
a
most
earnest
desire
to
learn
to
read
he
thought
he
should
know
how
to
serve
god
better
if
he
could
only
read
the
bible
he
came
to
me
and
begged
me
to
teach
him
he
said
he
could
not
pay
me
for
he
had
no
money
but
he
would
bring
me
nice
fruit
when
the
season
for
it
came
i
asked
him
if
he
did
know
it
was
contrary
to
law
and
that
slaves
were
whipped
and
imprisoned
for
teaching
each
other
to
read
this
brought
the
tears
into
his
eyes
do
be
troubled
uncle
fred
said
i
i
have
no
thoughts
of
refusing
to
teach
you
i
only
told
you
of
the
law
that
you
might
know
the
danger
and
be
on
your
guard
he
thought
he
could
plan
to
come
three
times
a
week
without
its
being
suspected
i
selected
a
quiet
nook
where
no
intruder
was
likely
to
penetrate
and
there
i
taught
him
his
a
b
considering
his
age
his
progress
was
astonishing
as
soon
as
he
could
spell
in
two
syllables
he
wanted
to
spell
out
words
in
the
bible
the
happy
smile
that
illuminated
his
face
put
joy
into
my
heart
after
spelling
out
a
few
words
he
paused
and
said
honey
it
when
i
can
read
dis
good
book
i
shall
be
nearer
to
god
white
man
is
got
all
de
sense
he
can
larn
easy
it
ai
easy
for
ole
black
man
like
me
i
only
wants
to
read
dis
book
dat
i
may
know
how
to
live
den
i
hab
no
fear
dying
i
tried
to
encourage
him
by
speaking
of
the
rapid
progress
he
had
made
hab
patience
child
he
replied
i
larns
slow
i
had
no
need
of
patience
his
gratitude
and
the
happiness
imparted
were
more
than
a
recompense
for
all
my
trouble
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
had
read
through
the
new
testament
and
could
find
any
text
in
it
one
day
when
he
had
recited
unusually
well
i
said
uncle
fred
how
do
you
manage
to
get
your
lessons
so
well
lord
bress
you
chile
he
replied
you
nebber
gibs
me
a
lesson
dat
i
do
pray
to
god
to
help
me
to
understan
what
i
spells
and
what
i
reads
and
he
help
me
chile
bress
his
holy
name
there
are
thousands
who
like
good
uncle
fred
are
thirsting
for
the
water
of
life
but
the
law
forbids
it
and
the
churches
withhold
it
they
send
the
bible
to
heathen
abroad
and
neglect
the
heathen
at
home
i
am
glad
that
missionaries
go
out
to
the
dark
corners
of
the
earth
but
i
ask
them
not
to
overlook
the
dark
corners
at
home
talk
to
american
slaveholders
as
you
talk
to
savages
in
africa
tell
it
was
wrong
to
traffic
in
men
tell
them
it
is
sinful
to
sell
their
own
children
and
atrocious
to
violate
their
own
daughters
tell
them
that
all
men
are
brethren
and
that
man
has
no
right
to
shut
out
the
light
of
knowledge
from
his
brother
tell
them
they
are
answerable
to
god
for
sealing
up
the
fountain
of
life
from
souls
that
are
thirsting
for
it
there
are
men
who
would
gladly
undertake
such
missionary
work
as
this
but
alas
their
number
is
small
they
are
hated
by
the
south
and
would
be
driven
from
its
soil
or
dragged
to
prison
to
die
as
others
have
been
before
them
the
field
is
ripe
for
the
harvest
and
awaits
the
reapers
perhaps
the
great
grandchildren
of
uncle
fred
may
have
freely
imparted
to
them
the
divine
treasures
which
he
sought
by
stealth
at
the
risk
of
the
prison
and
the
scourge
are
doctors
of
divinity
blind
or
are
they
hypocrites
i
suppose
some
are
the
one
and
some
the
other
but
i
think
if
they
felt
the
interest
in
the
poor
and
the
lowly
that
they
ought
to
feel
they
would
not
be
so
blinded
a
clergyman
who
goes
to
the
south
for
the
first
time
has
usually
some
feeling
however
vague
that
slavery
is
wrong
the
slaveholder
suspects
this
and
plays
his
game
accordingly
he
makes
himself
as
agreeable
as
possible
talks
on
theology
and
other
kindred
topics
the
reverend
gentleman
is
asked
to
invoke
a
blessing
on
a
table
loaded
with
luxuries
after
dinner
he
walks
round
the
premises
and
sees
the
beautiful
groves
and
flowering
vines
and
the
comfortable
huts
of
favored
household
slaves
the
southerner
invites
him
to
talk
with
those
slaves
he
asks
them
if
they
want
to
be
free
and
they
say
o
no
massa
this
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
him
he
comes
home
to
publish
a
south
side
view
of
slavery
and
to
complain
of
the
exaggerations
of
abolitionists
he
assures
people
that
he
has
been
to
the
south
and
seen
slavery
for
himself
that
it
is
a
beautiful
patriarchal
institution
that
the
slaves
do
want
their
freedom
that
they
have
hallelujah
meetings
and
other
religious
privileges
what
does
know
of
the
wretches
toiling
from
dawn
till
dark
on
the
plantations
of
mothers
shrieking
for
their
children
torn
from
their
arms
by
slave
traders
of
young
girls
dragged
down
into
moral
filth
of
pools
of
blood
around
the
whipping
post
of
hounds
trained
to
tear
human
flesh
of
men
screwed
into
cotton
gins
to
die
the
slaveholder
showed
him
none
of
these
things
and
the
slaves
dared
not
tell
of
them
if
he
had
asked
them
there
is
a
great
difference
between
christianity
and
religion
at
the
south
if
a
man
goes
to
the
communion
table
and
pays
money
into
the
treasury
of
the
church
no
matter
if
it
be
the
price
of
blood
he
is
called
religious
if
a
pastor
has
offspring
by
a
woman
not
his
wife
the
church
dismiss
him
if
she
is
a
white
woman
but
if
she
is
colored
it
does
not
hinder
his
continuing
to
be
their
good
shepherd
when
i
was
told
that
flint
had
joined
the
episcopal
church
i
was
much
surprised
i
supposed
that
religion
had
a
purifying
effect
on
the
character
of
men
but
the
worst
persecutions
i
endured
from
him
were
after
he
was
a
communicant
the
conversation
of
the
doctor
the
day
after
he
had
been
confirmed
certainly
gave
no
indication
that
he
had
renounced
the
devil
and
all
his
works
in
answer
to
some
of
his
usual
talk
i
reminded
him
that
he
had
just
joined
the
church
yes
linda
said
he
it
was
proper
for
me
to
do
so
i
am
getting
in
years
and
my
position
in
society
requires
it
and
it
puts
an
end
to
all
the
damned
slang
you
would
do
well
to
join
the
church
too
linda
there
are
sinners
enough
in
it
already
rejoined
i
if
i
could
be
allowed
to
live
like
a
christian
i
should
be
glad
you
can
do
what
i
require
and
if
you
are
faithful
to
me
you
will
be
as
virtuous
as
my
wife
he
replied
i
answered
that
the
bible
did
say
so
his
voice
became
hoarse
with
rage
how
dare
you
preach
to
me
about
your
infernal
bible
he
exclaimed
what
right
have
you
who
are
my
negro
to
talk
to
me
about
what
you
would
like
and
what
you
would
like
i
am
your
master
and
you
shall
obey
me
no
wonder
the
slaves
sing
ole
satan
church
is
here
below
up
to
god
free
church
i
hope
to
go
xiv
another
link
to
life
i
had
not
returned
to
my
master
house
since
the
birth
of
my
child
the
old
man
raved
to
have
me
thus
removed
from
his
immediate
power
but
his
wife
vowed
by
all
that
was
good
and
great
she
would
kill
me
if
i
came
back
and
he
did
not
doubt
her
word
sometimes
he
would
stay
away
for
a
season
then
he
would
come
and
renew
the
old
threadbare
discourse
about
his
forbearance
and
my
ingratitude
he
labored
most
unnecessarily
to
convince
me
that
i
had
lowered
myself
the
venomous
old
reprobate
had
no
need
of
descanting
on
that
theme
i
felt
humiliated
enough
my
unconscious
babe
was
the
witness
of
my
shame
i
listened
with
silent
contempt
when
he
talked
about
my
having
forfeited
good
opinion
but
i
shed
bitter
tears
that
i
was
no
longer
worthy
of
being
respected
by
the
good
and
pure
alas
slavery
still
held
me
in
its
poisonous
grasp
there
was
no
chance
for
me
to
be
respectable
there
was
no
prospect
of
being
able
to
lead
a
better
life
sometimes
when
my
master
found
that
i
still
refused
to
accept
what
he
called
his
kind
offers
he
would
threaten
to
sell
my
child
perhaps
that
will
humble
you
said
he
humble
was
i
not
already
in
the
dust
but
his
threat
lacerated
my
heart
i
knew
the
law
gave
him
power
to
fulfil
it
for
slaveholders
have
been
cunning
enough
to
enact
that
the
child
shall
follow
the
condition
of
the
not
of
the
thus
taking
care
that
licentiousness
shall
not
interfere
with
avarice
this
reflection
made
me
clasp
my
innocent
babe
all
the
more
firmly
to
my
heart
horrid
visions
passed
through
my
mind
when
i
thought
of
his
liability
to
fall
into
the
slave
trader
hands
i
wept
over
him
and
said
o
my
child
perhaps
they
will
leave
you
in
some
cold
cabin
to
die
and
then
throw
you
into
a
hole
as
if
you
were
a
dog
when
flint
learned
that
i
was
again
to
be
a
mother
he
was
exasperated
beyond
measure
he
rushed
from
the
house
and
returned
with
a
pair
of
shears
i
had
a
fine
head
of
hair
and
he
often
railed
about
my
pride
of
arranging
it
nicely
he
cut
every
hair
close
to
my
head
storming
and
swearing
all
the
time
i
replied
to
some
of
his
abuse
and
he
struck
me
some
months
before
he
had
pitched
me
down
stairs
in
a
fit
of
passion
and
the
injury
i
received
was
so
serious
that
i
was
unable
to
turn
myself
in
bed
for
many
days
he
then
said
linda
i
swear
by
god
i
will
never
raise
my
hand
against
you
again
but
i
knew
that
he
would
forget
his
promise
after
he
discovered
my
situation
he
was
like
a
restless
spirit
from
the
pit
he
came
every
day
and
i
was
subjected
to
such
insults
as
no
pen
can
describe
i
would
not
describe
them
if
i
could
they
were
too
low
too
revolting
i
tried
to
keep
them
from
my
grandmother
knowledge
as
much
as
i
could
i
knew
she
had
enough
to
sadden
her
life
without
having
my
troubles
to
bear
when
she
saw
the
doctor
treat
me
with
violence
and
heard
him
utter
oaths
terrible
enough
to
palsy
a
man
tongue
she
could
not
always
hold
her
peace
it
was
natural
and
motherlike
that
she
should
try
to
defend
me
but
it
only
made
matters
worse
when
they
told
me
my
babe
was
a
girl
my
heart
was
heavier
than
it
had
ever
been
before
slavery
is
terrible
for
men
but
it
is
far
more
terrible
for
women
superadded
to
the
burden
common
to
all
have
wrongs
and
sufferings
and
mortifications
peculiarly
their
own
flint
had
sworn
that
he
would
make
me
suffer
to
my
last
day
for
this
new
crime
against
as
he
called
it
and
as
long
as
he
had
me
in
his
power
he
kept
his
word
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
birth
of
my
babe
he
entered
my
room
suddenly
and
commanded
me
to
rise
and
bring
my
baby
to
him
the
nurse
who
took
care
of
me
had
gone
out
of
the
room
to
prepare
some
nourishment
and
i
was
alone
there
was
no
alternative
i
rose
took
up
my
babe
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
he
sat
now
stand
there
said
he
till
i
tell
you
to
go
back
my
child
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
her
father
and
to
the
deceased
sands
her
grandmother
he
noticed
this
and
while
i
stood
before
him
trembling
with
weakness
he
heaped
upon
me
and
my
little
one
every
vile
epithet
he
could
think
of
even
the
grandmother
in
her
grave
did
not
escape
his
curses
in
the
midst
of
his
vituperations
i
fainted
at
his
feet
this
recalled
him
to
his
senses
he
took
the
baby
from
my
arms
laid
it
on
the
bed
dashed
cold
water
in
my
face
took
me
up
and
shook
me
violently
to
restore
my
consciousness
before
any
one
entered
the
room
just
then
my
grandmother
came
in
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
house
i
suffered
in
consequence
of
this
treatment
but
i
begged
my
friends
to
let
me
die
rather
than
send
for
the
doctor
there
was
nothing
i
dreaded
so
much
as
his
presence
my
life
was
spared
and
i
was
glad
for
the
sake
of
my
little
ones
had
it
not
been
for
these
ties
to
life
i
should
have
been
glad
to
be
released
by
death
though
i
had
lived
only
nineteen
years
always
it
gave
me
a
pang
that
my
children
had
no
lawful
claim
to
a
name
their
father
offered
his
but
if
i
had
wished
to
accept
the
offer
i
dared
not
while
my
master
lived
moreover
i
knew
it
would
not
be
accepted
at
their
baptism
a
christian
name
they
were
at
least
entitled
to
and
we
resolved
to
call
my
boy
for
our
dear
good
benjamin
who
had
gone
far
away
from
us
my
grandmother
belonged
to
the
church
and
she
was
very
desirous
of
having
the
children
christened
i
knew
flint
would
forbid
it
and
i
did
not
venture
to
attempt
it
but
chance
favored
me
he
was
called
to
visit
a
patient
out
of
town
and
was
obliged
to
be
absent
during
sunday
now
is
the
time
said
my
grandmother
we
will
take
the
children
to
church
and
have
them
christened
when
i
entered
the
church
recollections
of
my
mother
came
over
me
and
i
felt
subdued
in
spirit
there
she
had
presented
me
for
baptism
without
any
reason
to
feel
ashamed
she
had
been
married
and
had
such
legal
rights
as
slavery
allows
to
a
slave
the
vows
had
at
least
been
sacred
to
and
she
had
never
violated
them
i
was
glad
she
was
not
alive
to
know
under
what
different
circumstances
her
grandchildren
were
presented
for
baptism
why
had
my
lot
been
so
different
from
my
mother
master
had
died
when
she
was
a
child
and
she
remained
with
her
mistress
till
she
married
she
was
never
in
the
power
of
any
master
and
thus
she
escaped
one
class
of
the
evils
that
generally
fall
upon
slaves
when
my
baby
was
about
to
be
christened
the
former
mistress
of
my
father
stepped
up
to
me
and
proposed
to
give
it
her
christian
name
to
this
i
added
the
surname
of
my
father
who
had
himself
no
legal
right
to
it
for
my
grandfather
on
the
paternal
side
was
a
white
gentleman
what
tangled
skeins
are
the
genealogies
of
slavery
i
loved
my
father
but
it
mortified
me
to
be
obliged
to
bestow
his
name
on
my
children
when
we
left
the
church
my
father
old
mistress
invited
me
to
go
home
with
her
she
clasped
a
gold
chain
round
my
baby
neck
i
thanked
her
for
this
kindness
but
i
did
not
like
the
emblem
i
wanted
no
chain
to
be
fastened
on
my
daughter
not
even
if
its
links
were
of
gold
how
earnestly
i
prayed
that
she
might
never
feel
the
weight
of
slavery
chain
whose
iron
entereth
into
the
soul
xv
continued
persecutions
my
children
grew
finely
and
flint
would
often
say
to
me
with
an
exulting
smile
these
brats
will
bring
me
a
handsome
sum
of
money
one
of
these
days
i
thought
to
myself
that
god
being
my
helper
they
should
never
pass
into
his
hands
it
seemed
to
me
i
would
rather
see
them
killed
than
have
them
given
up
to
his
power
the
money
for
the
freedom
of
myself
and
my
children
could
be
obtained
but
i
derived
no
advantage
from
that
circumstance
flint
loved
money
but
he
loved
power
more
after
much
discussion
my
friends
resolved
on
making
another
trial
there
was
a
slaveholder
about
to
leave
for
texas
and
he
was
commissioned
to
buy
me
he
was
to
begin
with
nine
hundred
dollars
and
go
up
to
twelve
my
master
refused
his
offers
sir
said
he
she
do
belong
to
me
she
is
my
daughter
property
and
i
have
no
right
to
sell
her
i
mistrust
that
you
come
from
her
paramour
if
so
you
may
tell
him
that
he
can
not
buy
her
for
any
money
neither
can
he
buy
her
children
the
doctor
came
to
see
me
the
next
day
and
my
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
entered
i
never
had
seen
the
old
man
tread
with
so
majestic
a
step
he
seated
himself
and
looked
at
me
with
withering
scorn
my
children
had
learned
to
be
afraid
of
him
the
little
one
would
shut
her
eyes
and
hide
her
face
on
my
shoulder
whenever
she
saw
him
and
benny
who
was
now
nearly
five
years
old
often
inquired
what
makes
that
bad
man
come
here
so
many
times
does
he
want
to
hurt
us
i
would
clasp
the
dear
boy
in
my
arms
trusting
that
he
would
be
free
before
he
was
old
enough
to
solve
the
problem
and
now
as
the
doctor
sat
there
so
grim
and
silent
the
child
left
his
play
and
came
and
nestled
up
by
me
at
last
my
tormentor
spoke
so
you
are
left
in
disgust
are
you
said
he
it
is
no
more
than
i
expected
you
remember
i
told
you
years
ago
that
you
would
be
treated
so
so
he
is
tired
of
you
ha
ha
ha
the
virtuous
madam
do
like
to
hear
about
it
does
she
ha
ha
ha
there
was
a
sting
in
his
calling
me
virtuous
madam
i
no
longer
had
the
power
of
answering
him
as
i
had
formerly
done
he
continued
so
it
seems
you
are
trying
to
get
up
another
intrigue
your
new
paramour
came
to
me
and
offered
to
buy
you
but
you
may
be
assured
you
will
not
succeed
you
are
mine
and
you
shall
be
mine
for
life
there
lives
no
human
being
that
can
take
you
out
of
slavery
i
would
have
done
it
but
you
rejected
my
kind
offer
i
told
him
i
did
not
wish
to
get
up
any
intrigue
that
i
had
never
seen
the
man
who
offered
to
buy
me
do
you
tell
me
i
lie
exclaimed
he
dragging
me
from
my
chair
will
you
say
again
that
you
never
saw
that
man
i
answered
i
do
say
so
he
clinched
my
arm
with
a
volley
of
oaths
ben
began
to
scream
and
i
told
him
to
go
to
his
grandmother
do
you
stir
a
step
you
little
wretch
said
he
the
child
drew
nearer
to
me
and
put
his
arms
round
me
as
if
he
wanted
to
protect
me
this
was
too
much
for
my
enraged
master
he
caught
him
up
and
hurled
him
across
the
room
i
thought
he
was
dead
and
rushed
towards
him
to
take
him
up
not
yet
exclaimed
the
doctor
let
him
lie
there
till
he
comes
to
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
screamed
or
i
will
raise
the
whole
house
i
struggled
and
got
away
but
he
clinched
me
again
somebody
opened
the
door
and
he
released
me
i
picked
up
my
insensible
child
and
when
i
turned
my
tormentor
was
gone
anxiously
i
bent
over
the
little
form
so
pale
and
still
and
when
the
brown
eyes
at
last
opened
i
do
know
whether
i
was
very
happy
all
the
doctor
former
persecutions
were
renewed
he
came
morning
noon
and
night
no
jealous
lover
ever
watched
a
rival
more
closely
than
he
watched
me
and
the
unknown
slaveholder
with
whom
he
accused
me
of
wishing
to
get
up
an
intrigue
when
my
grandmother
was
out
of
the
way
he
searched
every
room
to
find
him
in
one
of
his
visits
he
happened
to
find
a
young
girl
whom
he
had
sold
to
a
trader
a
few
days
previous
his
statement
was
that
he
sold
her
because
she
had
been
too
familiar
with
the
overseer
she
had
had
a
bitter
life
with
him
and
was
glad
to
be
sold
she
had
no
mother
and
no
near
ties
she
had
been
torn
from
all
her
family
years
before
a
few
friends
had
entered
into
bonds
for
her
safety
if
the
trader
would
allow
her
to
spend
with
them
the
time
that
intervened
between
her
sale
and
the
gathering
up
of
his
human
stock
such
a
favor
was
rarely
granted
it
saved
the
trader
the
expense
of
board
and
jail
fees
and
though
the
amount
was
small
it
was
a
weighty
consideration
in
a
slavetrader
mind
flint
always
had
an
aversion
to
meeting
slaves
after
he
had
sold
them
he
ordered
rose
out
of
the
house
but
he
was
no
longer
her
master
and
she
took
no
notice
of
him
for
once
the
crushed
rose
was
the
conqueror
his
gray
eyes
flashed
angrily
upon
her
but
that
was
the
extent
of
his
power
how
came
this
girl
here
he
exclaimed
what
right
had
you
to
allow
it
when
you
knew
i
had
sold
her
i
answered
this
is
my
grandmother
house
and
rose
came
to
see
her
i
have
no
right
to
turn
any
body
out
of
doors
that
comes
here
for
honest
purposes
he
gave
me
the
blow
that
would
have
fallen
upon
rose
if
she
had
still
been
his
slave
my
grandmother
attention
had
been
attracted
by
loud
voices
and
she
entered
in
time
to
see
a
second
blow
dealt
she
was
not
a
woman
to
let
such
an
outrage
in
her
own
house
go
unrebuked
the
doctor
undertook
to
explain
that
i
had
been
insolent
her
indignant
feelings
rose
higher
and
higher
and
finally
boiled
over
in
words
get
out
of
my
house
she
exclaimed
go
home
and
take
care
of
your
wife
and
children
and
you
will
have
enough
to
do
without
watching
my
family
he
threw
the
birth
of
my
children
in
her
face
and
accused
her
of
sanctioning
the
life
i
was
leading
she
told
him
i
was
living
with
her
by
compulsion
of
his
wife
that
he
need
accuse
her
for
he
was
the
one
to
blame
he
was
the
one
who
had
caused
all
the
trouble
she
grew
more
and
more
excited
as
she
went
on
i
tell
you
what
flint
said
she
you
ai
got
many
more
years
to
live
and
you
better
be
saying
your
prayers
it
will
take
all
and
more
too
to
wash
the
dirt
off
your
soul
do
you
know
whom
you
are
talking
to
he
exclaimed
she
replied
yes
i
know
very
well
who
i
am
talking
to
he
left
the
house
in
a
great
rage
i
looked
at
my
grandmother
our
eyes
met
their
angry
expression
had
passed
away
but
she
looked
sorrowful
and
weary
weary
of
incessant
strife
i
wondered
that
it
did
not
lessen
her
love
for
me
but
if
it
did
she
never
showed
it
she
was
always
kind
always
ready
to
sympathize
with
my
troubles
there
might
have
been
peace
and
contentment
in
that
humble
home
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
demon
slavery
the
winter
passed
undisturbed
by
the
doctor
the
beautiful
spring
came
and
when
nature
resumes
her
loveliness
the
human
soul
is
apt
to
revive
also
my
drooping
hopes
came
to
life
again
with
the
flowers
i
was
dreaming
of
freedom
again
more
for
my
children
sake
than
my
own
i
planned
and
i
planned
obstacles
hit
against
plans
there
seemed
no
way
of
overcoming
them
and
yet
i
hoped
back
came
the
wily
doctor
i
was
not
at
home
when
he
called
a
friend
had
invited
me
to
a
small
party
and
to
gratify
her
i
went
to
my
great
consternation
a
messenger
came
in
haste
to
say
that
flint
was
at
my
grandmother
and
insisted
on
seeing
me
they
did
not
tell
him
where
i
was
or
he
would
have
come
and
raised
a
disturbance
in
my
friend
house
they
sent
me
a
dark
wrapper
i
threw
it
on
and
hurried
home
my
speed
did
not
save
me
the
doctor
had
gone
away
in
anger
i
dreaded
the
morning
but
i
could
not
delay
it
it
came
warm
and
bright
at
an
early
hour
the
doctor
came
and
asked
me
where
i
had
been
last
night
i
told
him
he
did
not
believe
me
and
sent
to
my
friend
house
to
ascertain
the
facts
he
came
in
the
afternoon
to
assure
me
he
was
satisfied
that
i
had
spoken
the
truth
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
facetious
mood
and
i
expected
some
jeers
were
coming
i
suppose
you
need
some
recreation
said
he
but
i
am
surprised
at
your
being
there
among
those
negroes
it
was
not
the
place
for
are
you
to
visit
such
people
i
understood
this
covert
fling
at
the
white
gentleman
who
was
my
friend
but
i
merely
replied
i
went
to
visit
my
friends
and
any
company
they
keep
is
good
enough
for
me
he
went
on
to
say
i
have
seen
very
little
of
you
of
late
but
my
interest
in
you
is
unchanged
when
i
said
i
would
have
no
more
mercy
on
you
i
was
rash
i
recall
my
words
linda
you
desire
freedom
for
yourself
and
your
children
and
you
can
obtain
it
only
through
me
if
you
agree
to
what
i
am
about
to
propose
you
and
they
shall
be
free
there
must
be
no
communication
of
any
kind
between
you
and
their
father
i
will
procure
a
cottage
where
you
and
the
children
can
live
together
your
labor
shall
be
light
such
as
sewing
for
my
family
think
what
is
offered
you
linda
a
home
and
freedom
let
the
past
be
forgotten
if
i
have
been
harsh
with
you
at
times
your
willfulness
drove
me
to
it
you
know
i
exact
obedience
from
my
own
children
and
i
consider
you
as
yet
a
child
he
paused
for
an
answer
but
i
remained
silent
why
do
you
speak
said
he
what
more
do
you
wait
for
nothing
sir
then
you
accept
my
offer
no
sir
his
anger
was
ready
to
break
loose
but
he
succeeded
in
curbing
it
and
replied
you
have
answered
without
thought
but
i
must
let
you
know
there
are
two
sides
to
my
proposition
if
you
reject
the
bright
side
you
will
be
obliged
to
take
the
dark
one
you
must
either
accept
my
offer
or
you
and
your
children
shall
be
sent
to
your
young
master
plantation
there
to
remain
till
your
young
mistress
is
married
and
your
children
shall
fare
like
the
rest
of
the
negro
children
i
give
you
a
week
to
consider
it
he
was
shrewd
but
i
knew
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
i
told
him
i
was
ready
to
give
my
answer
now
i
will
not
receive
it
now
he
replied
you
act
too
much
from
impulse
remember
that
you
and
your
children
can
be
free
a
week
from
if
you
choose
on
what
a
monstrous
chance
hung
the
destiny
of
my
children
i
knew
that
my
master
offer
was
a
snare
and
that
if
i
entered
it
escape
would
be
impossible
as
for
his
promise
i
knew
him
so
well
that
i
was
sure
if
he
gave
me
free
papers
they
would
be
so
managed
as
to
have
no
legal
value
the
alternative
was
inevitable
i
resolved
to
go
to
the
plantation
but
then
i
thought
how
completely
i
should
be
in
his
power
and
the
prospect
was
appalling
even
if
i
should
kneel
before
him
and
implore
him
to
spare
me
for
the
sake
of
my
children
i
knew
he
would
spurn
me
with
his
foot
and
my
weakness
would
be
his
triumph
before
the
week
expired
i
heard
that
young
flint
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
lady
of
his
own
stamp
i
foresaw
the
position
i
should
occupy
in
his
establishment
i
had
once
been
sent
to
the
plantation
for
punishment
and
fear
of
the
son
had
induced
the
father
to
recall
me
very
soon
my
mind
was
made
up
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
foil
my
master
and
save
my
children
or
i
would
perish
in
the
attempt
i
kept
my
plans
to
myself
i
knew
that
friends
would
try
to
dissuade
me
from
them
and
i
would
not
wound
their
feelings
by
rejecting
their
advice
on
the
decisive
day
the
doctor
came
and
said
he
hoped
i
had
made
a
wise
choice
i
am
ready
to
go
to
the
plantation
sir
i
replied
have
you
thought
how
important
your
decision
is
to
your
children
said
he
i
told
him
i
had
very
well
go
to
the
plantation
and
my
curse
go
with
you
he
replied
your
boy
shall
be
put
to
work
and
he
shall
soon
be
sold
and
your
girl
shall
be
raised
for
the
purpose
of
selling
well
go
your
own
ways
he
left
the
room
with
curses
not
to
be
repeated
as
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
my
grandmother
came
and
said
linda
child
what
did
you
tell
him
i
answered
that
i
was
going
to
the
plantation
you
go
said
she
ca
something
be
done
to
stop
it
i
told
her
it
was
useless
to
try
but
she
begged
me
not
to
give
up
she
said
she
would
go
to
the
doctor
and
remind
him
how
long
and
how
faithfully
she
had
served
in
the
family
and
how
she
had
taken
her
own
baby
from
her
breast
to
nourish
his
wife
she
would
tell
him
i
had
been
out
of
the
family
so
long
they
would
not
miss
me
that
she
would
pay
them
for
my
time
and
the
money
would
procure
a
woman
who
had
more
strength
for
the
situation
than
i
had
i
begged
her
not
to
go
but
she
persisted
in
saying
he
will
listen
to
linda
she
went
and
was
treated
as
i
expected
he
coolly
listened
to
what
she
said
but
denied
her
request
he
told
her
that
what
he
did
was
for
my
good
that
my
feelings
were
entirely
above
my
situation
and
that
on
the
plantation
i
would
receive
treatment
that
was
suitable
to
my
behavior
my
grandmother
was
much
cast
down
i
had
my
secret
hopes
but
i
must
fight
my
battle
alone
i
had
a
woman
pride
and
a
mother
love
for
my
children
and
i
resolved
that
out
of
the
darkness
of
this
hour
a
brighter
dawn
should
rise
for
them
my
master
had
power
and
law
on
his
side
i
had
a
determined
will
there
is
might
in
each
xvi
scenes
at
the
plantation
early
the
next
morning
i
left
my
grandmother
with
my
youngest
child
my
boy
was
ill
and
i
left
him
behind
i
had
many
sad
thoughts
as
the
old
wagon
jolted
on
hitherto
i
had
suffered
alone
now
my
little
one
was
to
be
treated
as
a
slave
as
we
drew
near
the
great
house
i
thought
of
the
time
when
i
was
formerly
sent
there
out
of
revenge
i
wondered
for
what
purpose
i
was
now
sent
i
could
not
tell
i
resolved
to
obey
orders
so
far
as
duty
required
but
within
myself
i
determined
to
make
my
stay
as
short
as
possible
flint
was
waiting
to
receive
us
and
told
me
to
follow
him
up
stairs
to
receive
orders
for
the
day
my
little
ellen
was
left
below
in
the
kitchen
it
was
a
change
for
her
who
had
always
been
so
carefully
tended
my
young
master
said
she
might
amuse
herself
in
the
yard
this
was
kind
of
him
since
the
child
was
hateful
to
his
sight
my
task
was
to
fit
up
the
house
for
the
reception
of
the
bride
in
the
midst
of
sheets
tablecloths
towels
drapery
and
carpeting
my
head
was
as
busy
planning
as
were
my
fingers
with
the
needle
at
noon
i
was
allowed
to
go
to
ellen
she
had
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
i
heard
flint
say
to
a
neighbor
got
her
down
here
and
i
soon
take
the
town
notions
out
of
her
head
my
father
is
partly
to
blame
for
her
nonsense
he
ought
to
have
broke
her
in
long
ago
the
remark
was
made
within
my
hearing
and
it
would
have
been
quite
as
manly
to
have
made
it
to
my
face
he
said
things
to
my
face
which
might
or
might
not
have
surprised
his
neighbor
if
he
had
known
of
them
he
was
a
chip
of
the
old
block
i
resolved
to
give
him
no
cause
to
accuse
me
of
being
too
much
of
a
lady
so
far
as
work
was
concerned
i
worked
day
and
night
with
wretchedness
before
me
when
i
lay
down
beside
my
child
i
felt
how
much
easier
it
would
be
to
see
her
die
than
to
see
her
master
beat
her
about
as
i
daily
saw
him
beat
other
little
ones
the
spirit
of
the
mothers
was
so
crushed
by
the
lash
that
they
stood
by
without
courage
to
remonstrate
how
much
more
must
i
suffer
before
i
should
be
broke
in
to
that
degree
i
wished
to
appear
as
contented
as
possible
sometimes
i
had
an
opportunity
to
send
a
few
lines
home
and
this
brought
up
recollections
that
made
it
difficult
for
a
time
to
seem
calm
and
indifferent
to
my
lot
notwithstanding
my
efforts
i
saw
that
flint
regarded
me
with
a
suspicious
eye
ellen
broke
down
under
the
trials
of
her
new
life
separated
from
me
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
she
wandered
about
and
in
a
few
days
cried
herself
sick
one
day
she
sat
under
the
window
where
i
was
at
work
crying
that
weary
cry
which
makes
a
mother
heart
bleed
i
was
obliged
to
steel
myself
to
bear
it
after
a
while
it
ceased
i
looked
out
and
she
was
gone
as
it
was
near
noon
i
ventured
to
go
down
in
search
of
her
the
great
house
was
raised
two
feet
above
the
ground
i
looked
under
it
and
saw
her
about
midway
fast
asleep
i
crept
under
and
drew
her
out
as
i
held
her
in
my
arms
i
thought
how
well
it
would
be
for
her
if
she
never
waked
up
and
i
uttered
my
thought
aloud
i
was
startled
to
hear
some
one
say
did
you
speak
to
me
i
looked
up
and
saw
flint
standing
beside
me
he
said
nothing
further
but
turned
frowning
away
that
night
he
sent
ellen
a
biscuit
and
a
cup
of
sweetened
milk
this
generosity
surprised
me
i
learned
afterwards
that
in
the
afternoon
he
had
killed
a
large
snake
which
crept
from
under
the
house
and
i
supposed
that
incident
had
prompted
his
unusual
kindness
the
next
morning
the
old
cart
was
loaded
with
shingles
for
town
i
put
ellen
into
it
and
sent
her
to
her
grandmother
flint
said
i
ought
to
have
asked
his
permission
i
told
him
the
child
was
sick
and
required
attention
which
i
had
no
time
to
give
he
let
it
pass
for
he
was
aware
that
i
had
accomplished
much
work
in
a
little
time
i
had
been
three
weeks
on
the
plantation
when
i
planned
a
visit
home
it
must
be
at
night
after
every
body
was
in
bed
i
was
six
miles
from
town
and
the
road
was
very
dreary
i
was
to
go
with
a
young
man
who
i
knew
often
stole
to
town
to
see
his
mother
one
night
when
all
was
quiet
we
started
fear
gave
speed
to
our
steps
and
we
were
not
long
in
performing
the
journey
i
arrived
at
my
grandmother
her
bed
room
was
on
the
first
floor
and
the
window
was
open
the
weather
being
warm
i
spoke
to
her
and
she
awoke
she
let
me
in
and
closed
the
window
lest
some
late
should
see
me
a
light
was
brought
and
the
whole
household
gathered
round
me
some
smiling
and
some
crying
i
went
to
look
at
my
children
and
thanked
god
for
their
happy
sleep
the
tears
fell
as
i
leaned
over
them
as
i
moved
to
leave
benny
stirred
i
turned
back
and
whispered
mother
is
here
after
digging
at
his
eyes
with
his
little
fist
they
opened
and
he
sat
up
in
bed
looking
at
me
curiously
having
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
i
he
exclaimed
o
mother
you
ai
dad
are
you
they
did
cut
off
your
head
at
the
plantation
did
they
my
time
was
up
too
soon
and
my
guide
was
waiting
for
me
i
laid
benny
back
in
his
bed
and
dried
his
tears
by
a
promise
to
come
again
soon
rapidly
we
retraced
our
steps
back
to
the
plantation
about
half
way
we
were
met
by
a
company
of
four
patrols
luckily
we
heard
their
horse
hoofs
before
they
came
in
sight
and
we
had
time
to
hide
behind
a
large
tree
they
passed
hallooing
and
shouting
in
a
manner
that
indicated
a
recent
carousal
how
thankful
we
were
that
they
had
not
their
dogs
with
them
we
hastened
our
footsteps
and
when
we
arrived
on
the
plantation
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
the
slaves
were
grinding
their
corn
we
were
safely
in
the
house
before
the
horn
summoned
them
to
their
labor
i
divided
my
little
parcel
of
food
with
my
guide
knowing
that
he
had
lost
the
chance
of
grinding
his
corn
and
must
toil
all
day
in
the
field
flint
often
took
an
inspection
of
the
house
to
see
that
no
one
was
idle
the
entire
management
of
the
work
was
trusted
to
me
because
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
rather
than
hire
a
superintendent
he
contented
himself
with
my
arrangements
he
had
often
urged
upon
his
father
the
necessity
of
having
me
at
the
plantation
to
take
charge
of
his
affairs
and
make
clothes
for
the
slaves
but
the
old
man
knew
him
too
well
to
consent
to
that
arrangement
when
i
had
been
working
a
month
at
the
plantation
the
great
aunt
of
flint
came
to
make
him
a
visit
this
was
the
good
old
lady
who
paid
fifty
dollars
for
my
grandmother
for
the
purpose
of
making
her
free
when
she
stood
on
the
auction
block
my
grandmother
loved
this
old
lady
whom
we
all
called
miss
fanny
she
often
came
to
take
tea
with
us
on
such
occasions
the
table
was
spread
with
a
cloth
and
the
china
cups
and
silver
spoons
were
taken
from
the
buffet
there
were
hot
muffins
tea
rusks
and
delicious
sweetmeats
my
grandmother
kept
two
cows
and
the
fresh
cream
was
miss
fanny
delight
she
invariably
declared
that
it
was
the
best
in
town
the
old
ladies
had
cosey
times
together
they
would
work
and
chat
and
sometimes
while
talking
over
old
times
their
spectacles
would
get
dim
with
tears
and
would
have
to
be
taken
off
and
wiped
when
miss
fanny
bade
us
good
by
her
bag
was
filled
with
grandmother
best
cakes
and
she
was
urged
to
come
again
soon
there
had
been
a
time
when
flint
wife
came
to
take
tea
with
us
and
when
her
children
were
also
sent
to
have
a
feast
of
aunt
marthy
nice
cooking
but
after
i
became
an
object
of
her
jealousy
and
spite
she
was
angry
with
grandmother
for
giving
a
shelter
to
me
and
my
children
she
would
not
even
speak
to
her
in
the
street
this
wounded
my
feelings
for
she
could
not
retain
ill
will
against
the
woman
whom
she
had
nourished
with
her
milk
when
a
babe
the
doctor
wife
would
gladly
have
prevented
our
intercourse
with
miss
fanny
if
she
could
have
done
it
but
fortunately
she
was
not
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
the
flints
she
had
enough
to
be
independent
and
that
is
more
than
can
ever
be
gained
from
charity
however
lavish
it
may
be
miss
fanny
was
endeared
to
me
by
many
recollections
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
her
at
the
plantation
the
warmth
of
her
large
loyal
heart
made
the
house
seem
pleasanter
while
she
was
in
it
she
staid
a
week
and
i
had
many
talks
with
her
she
said
her
principal
object
in
coming
was
to
see
how
i
was
treated
and
whether
any
thing
could
be
done
for
me
she
inquired
whether
she
could
help
me
in
any
way
i
told
her
i
believed
not
she
condoled
with
me
in
her
own
peculiar
way
saying
she
wished
that
i
and
all
my
grandmother
family
were
at
rest
in
our
graves
for
not
until
then
should
she
feel
any
peace
about
us
the
good
old
soul
did
not
dream
that
i
was
planning
to
bestow
peace
upon
her
with
regard
to
myself
and
my
children
not
by
death
but
by
securing
our
freedom
again
and
again
i
had
traversed
those
dreary
twelve
miles
to
and
from
the
town
and
all
the
way
i
was
meditating
upon
some
means
of
escape
for
myself
and
my
children
my
friends
had
made
every
effort
that
ingenuity
could
devise
to
effect
our
purchase
but
all
their
plans
had
proved
abortive
flint
was
suspicious
and
determined
not
to
loosen
his
grasp
upon
us
i
could
have
made
my
escape
alone
but
it
was
more
for
my
helpless
children
than
for
myself
that
i
longed
for
freedom
though
the
boon
would
have
been
precious
to
me
above
all
price
i
would
not
have
taken
it
at
the
expense
of
leaving
them
in
slavery
every
trial
i
endured
every
sacrifice
i
made
for
their
sakes
drew
them
closer
to
my
heart
and
gave
me
fresh
courage
to
beat
back
the
dark
waves
that
rolled
and
rolled
over
me
in
a
seemingly
endless
night
of
storms
the
six
weeks
were
nearly
completed
when
flint
bride
was
expected
to
take
possession
of
her
new
home
the
arrangements
were
all
completed
and
flint
said
i
had
done
well
he
expected
to
leave
home
on
saturday
and
return
with
his
bride
the
following
wednesday
after
receiving
various
orders
from
him
i
ventured
to
ask
permission
to
spend
sunday
in
town
it
was
granted
for
which
favor
i
was
thankful
it
was
the
first
i
had
ever
asked
of
him
and
i
intended
it
should
be
the
last
i
needed
more
than
one
night
to
accomplish
the
project
i
had
in
view
but
the
whole
of
sunday
would
give
me
an
opportunity
i
spent
the
sabbath
with
my
grandmother
a
calmer
more
beautiful
day
never
came
down
out
of
heaven
to
me
it
was
a
day
of
conflicting
emotions
perhaps
it
was
the
last
day
i
should
ever
spend
under
that
dear
old
sheltering
roof
perhaps
these
were
the
last
talks
i
should
ever
have
with
the
faithful
old
friend
of
my
whole
life
perhaps
it
was
the
last
time
i
and
my
children
should
be
together
well
better
so
i
thought
than
that
they
should
be
slaves
i
knew
the
doom
that
awaited
my
fair
baby
in
slavery
and
i
determined
to
save
her
from
it
or
perish
in
the
attempt
i
went
to
make
this
vow
at
the
graves
of
my
poor
parents
in
the
of
the
slaves
there
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest
there
the
prisoners
rest
together
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor
the
servant
is
free
from
his
master
i
knelt
by
the
graves
of
my
parents
and
thanked
god
as
i
had
often
done
before
that
they
had
not
lived
to
witness
my
trials
or
to
mourn
over
my
sins
i
had
received
my
mother
blessing
when
she
died
and
in
many
an
hour
of
tribulation
i
had
seemed
to
hear
her
voice
sometimes
chiding
me
sometimes
whispering
loving
words
into
my
wounded
heart
i
have
shed
many
and
bitter
tears
to
think
that
when
i
am
gone
from
my
children
they
can
not
remember
me
with
such
entire
satisfaction
as
i
remembered
my
mother
the
graveyard
was
in
the
woods
and
twilight
was
coming
on
nothing
broke
the
stillness
except
the
occasional
twitter
of
a
bird
my
spirit
was
overawed
by
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
for
more
than
ten
years
i
had
frequented
this
spot
but
never
had
it
seemed
to
me
so
sacred
as
now
a
black
stump
at
the
head
of
my
mother
grave
was
all
that
remained
of
a
tree
my
father
had
planted
his
grave
was
marked
by
a
small
wooden
board
bearing
his
name
the
letters
of
which
were
nearly
obliterated
i
knelt
down
and
kissed
them
and
poured
forth
a
prayer
to
god
for
guidance
and
support
in
the
perilous
step
i
was
about
to
take
as
i
passed
the
wreck
of
the
old
meeting
house
where
before
nat
turner
time
the
slaves
had
been
allowed
to
meet
for
worship
i
seemed
to
hear
my
father
voice
come
from
it
bidding
me
not
to
tarry
till
i
reached
freedom
or
the
grave
i
rushed
on
with
renovated
hopes
my
trust
in
god
had
been
strengthened
by
that
prayer
among
the
graves
my
plan
was
to
conceal
myself
at
the
house
of
a
friend
and
remain
there
a
few
weeks
till
the
search
was
over
my
hope
was
that
the
doctor
would
get
discouraged
and
for
fear
of
losing
my
value
and
also
of
subsequently
finding
my
children
among
the
missing
he
would
consent
to
sell
us
and
i
knew
somebody
would
buy
us
i
had
done
all
in
my
power
to
make
my
children
comfortable
during
the
time
i
expected
to
be
separated
from
them
i
was
packing
my
things
when
grandmother
came
into
the
room
and
asked
what
i
was
doing
i
am
putting
my
things
in
order
i
replied
i
tried
to
look
and
speak
cheerfully
but
her
watchful
eye
detected
something
beneath
the
surface
she
drew
me
towards
her
and
asked
me
to
sit
down
she
looked
earnestly
at
me
and
said
linda
do
you
want
to
kill
your
old
grandmother
do
you
mean
to
leave
your
little
helpless
children
i
am
old
now
and
can
not
do
for
your
babies
as
i
once
did
for
you
i
replied
that
if
i
went
away
perhaps
their
father
would
be
able
to
secure
their
freedom
ah
my
child
said
she
do
trust
too
much
to
him
stand
by
your
own
children
and
suffer
with
them
till
death
nobody
respects
a
mother
who
forsakes
her
children
and
if
you
leave
them
you
will
never
have
a
happy
moment
if
you
go
you
will
make
me
miserable
the
short
time
i
have
to
live
you
would
be
taken
and
brought
back
and
your
sufferings
would
be
dreadful
remember
poor
benjamin
do
give
it
up
linda
try
to
bear
a
little
longer
things
may
turn
out
better
than
we
expect
my
courage
failed
me
in
view
of
the
sorrow
i
should
bring
on
that
faithful
loving
old
heart
i
promised
that
i
would
try
longer
and
that
i
would
take
nothing
out
of
her
house
without
her
knowledge
whenever
the
children
climbed
on
my
knee
or
laid
their
heads
on
my
lap
she
would
say
poor
little
souls
what
would
you
do
without
a
mother
she
do
love
you
as
i
do
and
she
would
hug
them
to
her
own
bosom
as
if
to
reproach
me
for
my
want
of
affection
but
she
knew
all
the
while
that
i
loved
them
better
than
my
life
i
slept
with
her
that
night
and
it
was
the
last
time
the
memory
of
it
haunted
me
for
many
a
year
on
monday
i
returned
to
the
plantation
and
busied
myself
with
preparations
for
the
important
day
wednesday
came
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
faces
of
the
slaves
were
as
bright
as
the
sunshine
the
poor
creatures
were
merry
they
were
expecting
little
presents
from
the
bride
and
hoping
for
better
times
under
her
administration
i
had
no
such
hopes
for
them
i
knew
that
the
young
wives
of
slaveholders
often
thought
their
authority
and
importance
would
be
best
established
and
maintained
by
cruelty
and
what
i
had
heard
of
young
flint
gave
me
no
reason
to
expect
that
her
rule
over
them
would
be
less
severe
than
that
of
the
master
and
overseer
truly
the
colored
race
are
the
most
cheerful
and
forgiving
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
their
masters
sleep
in
safety
is
owing
to
their
superabundance
of
heart
and
yet
they
look
upon
their
sufferings
with
less
pity
than
they
would
bestow
on
those
of
a
horse
or
a
dog
i
stood
at
the
door
with
others
to
receive
the
bridegroom
and
bride
she
was
a
handsome
girl
and
her
face
flushed
with
emotion
at
sight
of
her
new
home
i
thought
it
likely
that
visions
of
a
happy
future
were
rising
before
her
it
made
me
sad
for
i
knew
how
soon
clouds
would
come
over
her
sunshine
she
examined
every
part
of
the
house
and
told
me
she
was
delighted
with
the
arrangements
i
had
made
i
was
afraid
old
flint
had
tried
to
prejudice
her
against
me
and
i
did
my
best
to
please
her
all
passed
off
smoothly
for
me
until
dinner
time
arrived
i
did
not
mind
the
embarrassment
of
waiting
on
a
dinner
party
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
half
so
much
as
i
did
the
meeting
with
flint
and
his
wife
who
would
be
among
the
guests
it
was
a
mystery
to
me
why
flint
had
not
made
her
appearance
at
the
plantation
during
all
the
time
i
was
putting
the
house
in
order
i
had
not
met
her
face
to
face
for
five
years
and
i
had
no
wish
to
see
her
now
she
was
a
praying
woman
and
doubtless
considered
my
present
position
a
special
answer
to
her
prayers
nothing
could
please
her
better
than
to
see
me
humbled
and
trampled
upon
i
was
just
where
she
would
have
me
in
the
power
of
a
hard
unprincipled
master
she
did
not
speak
to
me
when
she
took
her
seat
at
table
but
her
satisfied
triumphant
smile
when
i
handed
her
plate
was
more
eloquent
than
words
the
old
doctor
was
not
so
quiet
in
his
demonstrations
he
ordered
me
here
and
there
and
spoke
with
peculiar
emphasis
when
he
said
your
i
was
drilled
like
a
disgraced
soldier
when
all
was
over
and
the
last
key
turned
i
sought
my
pillow
thankful
that
god
had
appointed
a
season
of
rest
for
the
weary
the
next
day
my
new
mistress
began
her
housekeeping
i
was
not
exactly
appointed
maid
of
all
work
but
i
was
to
do
whatever
i
was
told
monday
evening
came
it
was
always
a
busy
time
on
that
night
the
slaves
received
their
weekly
allowance
of
food
three
pounds
of
meat
a
peck
of
corn
and
perhaps
a
dozen
herring
were
allowed
to
each
man
women
received
a
pound
and
a
half
of
meat
a
peck
of
corn
and
the
same
number
of
herring
children
over
twelve
years
old
had
half
the
allowance
of
the
women
the
meat
was
cut
and
weighed
by
the
foreman
of
the
field
hands
and
piled
on
planks
before
the
meat
house
then
the
second
foreman
went
behind
the
building
and
when
the
first
foreman
called
out
who
takes
this
piece
of
meat
he
answered
by
calling
somebody
name
this
method
was
resorted
to
as
a
means
of
preventing
partiality
in
distributing
the
meat
the
young
mistress
came
out
to
see
how
things
were
done
on
her
plantation
and
she
soon
gave
a
specimen
of
her
character
among
those
in
waiting
for
their
allowance
was
a
very
old
slave
who
had
faithfully
served
the
flint
family
through
three
generations
when
he
hobbled
up
to
get
his
bit
of
meat
the
mistress
said
he
was
too
old
to
have
any
allowance
that
when
niggers
were
too
old
to
work
they
ought
to
be
fed
on
grass
poor
old
man
he
suffered
much
before
he
found
rest
in
the
grave
my
mistress
and
i
got
along
very
well
together
at
the
end
of
a
week
old
flint
made
us
another
visit
and
was
closeted
a
long
time
with
her
i
had
my
suspicions
what
was
the
subject
of
the
conference
the
old
doctor
wife
had
been
informed
that
i
could
leave
the
plantation
on
one
condition
and
she
was
very
desirous
to
keep
me
there
if
she
had
trusted
me
as
i
deserved
to
be
trusted
by
her
she
would
have
had
no
fears
of
my
accepting
that
condition
when
she
entered
her
carriage
to
return
home
she
said
to
young
flint
do
neglect
to
send
for
them
as
quick
as
possible
my
heart
was
on
the
watch
all
the
time
and
i
at
once
concluded
that
she
spoke
of
my
children
the
doctor
came
the
next
day
and
as
i
entered
the
room
to
spread
the
tea
table
i
heard
him
say
wait
any
longer
send
for
them
i
saw
through
the
plan
they
thought
my
children
being
there
would
fetter
me
to
the
spot
and
that
it
was
a
good
place
to
break
us
all
in
to
abject
submission
to
our
lot
as
slaves
after
the
doctor
left
a
gentleman
called
who
had
always
manifested
friendly
feelings
towards
my
grandmother
and
her
family
flint
carried
him
over
the
plantation
to
show
him
the
results
of
labor
performed
by
men
and
women
who
were
unpaid
miserably
clothed
and
half
famished
the
cotton
crop
was
all
they
thought
of
it
was
duly
admired
and
the
gentleman
returned
with
specimens
to
show
his
friends
i
was
ordered
to
carry
water
to
wash
his
hands
as
i
did
so
he
said
linda
how
do
you
like
your
new
home
i
told
him
i
liked
it
as
well
as
i
expected
he
replied
they
do
think
you
are
contented
and
they
are
going
to
bring
your
children
to
be
with
you
i
am
sorry
for
you
linda
i
hope
they
will
treat
you
kindly
i
hurried
from
the
room
unable
to
thank
him
my
suspicions
were
correct
my
children
were
to
be
brought
to
the
plantation
to
be
broke
in
to
this
day
i
feel
grateful
to
the
gentleman
who
gave
me
this
timely
information
it
nerved
me
to
immediate
action
xvii
the
flight
flint
was
hard
pushed
for
house
servants
and
rather
than
lose
me
he
had
restrained
his
malice
i
did
my
work
faithfully
though
not
of
course
with
a
willing
mind
they
were
evidently
afraid
i
should
leave
them
flint
wished
that
i
should
sleep
in
the
great
house
instead
of
the
servants
quarters
his
wife
agreed
to
the
proposition
but
said
i
bring
my
bed
into
the
house
because
it
would
scatter
feathers
on
her
carpet
i
knew
when
i
went
there
that
they
would
never
think
of
such
a
thing
as
furnishing
a
bed
of
any
kind
for
me
and
my
little
ones
i
therefore
carried
my
own
bed
and
now
i
was
forbidden
to
use
it
i
did
as
i
was
ordered
but
now
that
i
was
certain
my
children
were
to
be
put
in
their
power
in
order
to
give
them
a
stronger
hold
on
me
i
resolved
to
leave
them
that
night
i
remembered
the
grief
this
step
would
bring
upon
my
dear
old
grandmother
and
nothing
less
than
the
freedom
of
my
children
would
have
induced
me
to
disregard
her
advice
i
went
about
my
evening
work
with
trembling
steps
flint
twice
called
from
his
chamber
door
to
inquire
why
the
house
was
not
locked
up
i
replied
that
i
had
not
done
my
work
you
have
had
time
enough
to
do
it
said
he
take
care
how
you
answer
me
i
shut
all
the
windows
locked
all
the
doors
and
went
up
to
the
third
story
to
wait
till
midnight
how
long
those
hours
seemed
and
how
fervently
i
prayed
that
god
would
not
forsake
me
in
this
hour
of
utmost
need
i
was
about
to
risk
every
thing
on
the
throw
of
a
die
and
if
i
failed
o
what
would
become
of
me
and
my
poor
children
they
would
be
made
to
suffer
for
my
fault
at
half
past
twelve
i
stole
softly
down
stairs
i
stopped
on
the
second
floor
thinking
i
heard
a
noise
i
felt
my
way
down
into
the
parlor
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
night
was
so
intensely
dark
that
i
could
see
nothing
i
raised
the
window
very
softly
and
jumped
out
large
drops
of
rain
were
falling
and
the
darkness
bewildered
me
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
breathed
a
short
prayer
to
god
for
guidance
and
protection
i
groped
my
way
to
the
road
and
rushed
towards
the
town
with
almost
lightning
speed
i
arrived
at
my
grandmother
house
but
dared
not
see
her
she
would
say
linda
you
are
killing
me
and
i
knew
that
would
unnerve
me
i
tapped
softly
at
the
window
of
a
room
occupied
by
a
woman
who
had
lived
in
the
house
several
years
i
knew
she
was
a
faithful
friend
and
could
be
trusted
with
my
secret
i
tapped
several
times
before
she
heard
me
at
last
she
raised
the
window
and
i
whispered
sally
i
have
run
away
let
me
in
quick
she
opened
the
door
softly
and
said
in
low
tones
for
god
sake
do
your
grandmother
is
trying
to
buy
you
and
de
chillern
sands
was
here
last
week

but
he
wanted
her
to

ahead
about

you
and
de
chillern
and
he
would
help
her
all
he
could
do
run
away
linda
your
grandmother
is
all
bowed
down
wid
trouble
now
i
replied
sally
they
are
going
to
carry
my
children
to
the
plantation
and
they
will
never
sell
them
to
any
body
so
long
as
they
have
me
in
their
power
now

inch
ob
dis
house
i
told
her
i
had
a
and
that
was
all
it
was
best
for
her
to
know
i
asked
her
to
go
into
my
room
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
take
all
my
clothes
out
of
my
trunk
and
pack
them
in
hers
for
i
knew
flint
and
the
constable
would
be
there
early
to
search
my
room
i
feared
the
sight
of
my
children
would
be
too
much
for
my
full
heart
but
i
could
not
go
into
the
uncertain
future
without
one
last
look
i
bent
over
the
bed
where
lay
my
little
benny
and
baby
ellen
poor
little
ones
fatherless
and
motherless
memories
of
their
father
came
over
me
he
wanted
to
be
kind
to
them
but
they
were
not
all
to
him
as
they
were
to
my
womanly
heart
i
knelt
and
prayed
for
the
innocent
little
sleepers
i
kissed
them
lightly
and
turned
away
as
i
was
about
to
open
the
street
door
sally
laid
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
linda
is
you
gwine
all
alone
let
me
call
your
uncle
no
sally
i
replied
i
want
no
one
to
be
brought
into
trouble
on
my
account
i
went
forth
into
the
darkness
and
rain
i
ran
on
till
i
came
to
the
house
of
the
friend
who
was
to
conceal
me
early
the
next
morning
flint
was
at
my
grandmother
inquiring
for
me
she
told
him
she
had
not
seen
me
and
supposed
i
was
at
the
plantation
he
watched
her
face
narrowly
and
said
do
you
know
any
thing
about
her
running
off
she
assured
him
that
she
did
not
he
went
on
to
say
last
night
she
ran
off
without
the
least
provocation
we
had
treated
her
very
kindly
my
wife
liked
her
she
will
soon
be
found
and
brought
back
are
her
children
with
you
when
told
that
they
were
he
said
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
if
they
are
here
she
can
not
be
far
off
if
i
find
out
that
any
of
my
niggers
have
had
any
thing
to
do
with
this
damned
business
i
give
five
hundred
lashes
as
he
started
to
go
to
his
father
he
turned
round
and
added
persuasively
let
her
be
brought
back
and
she
shall
have
her
children
to
live
with
her
the
tidings
made
the
old
doctor
rave
and
storm
at
a
furious
rate
it
was
a
busy
day
for
them
my
grandmother
house
was
searched
from
top
to
bottom
as
my
trunk
was
empty
they
concluded
i
had
taken
my
clothes
with
me
before
ten
every
vessel
northward
bound
was
thoroughly
examined
and
the
law
against
harboring
fugitives
was
read
to
all
on
board
at
night
a
watch
was
set
over
the
town
knowing
how
distressed
my
grandmother
would
be
i
wanted
to
send
her
a
message
but
it
could
not
be
done
every
one
who
went
in
or
out
of
her
house
was
closely
watched
the
doctor
said
he
would
take
my
children
unless
she
became
responsible
for
them
which
of
course
she
willingly
did
the
next
day
was
spent
in
searching
before
night
the
following
advertisement
was
posted
at
every
corner
and
in
every
public
place
for
miles
round
reward
ran
away
from
the
subscriber
an
intelligent
bright
mulatto
girl
named
linda
years
of
age
five
feet
four
inches
high
dark
eyes
and
black
hair
inclined
to
curl
but
it
can
be
made
straight
has
a
decayed
spot
on
a
front
tooth
she
can
read
and
write
and
in
all
probability
will
try
to
get
to
the
free
states
all
persons
are
forbidden
under
penalty
of
law
to
harbor
or
employ
said
slave
will
be
given
to
whoever
takes
her
in
the
state
and
if
taken
out
of
the
state
and
delivered
to
me
or
lodged
in
jail
flint
xviii
months
of
peril
the
search
for
me
was
kept
up
with
more
perseverence
than
i
had
anticipated
i
began
to
think
that
escape
was
impossible
i
was
in
great
anxiety
lest
i
should
implicate
the
friend
who
harbored
me
i
knew
the
consequences
would
be
frightful
and
much
as
i
dreaded
being
caught
even
that
seemed
better
than
causing
an
innocent
person
to
suffer
for
kindness
to
me
a
week
had
passed
in
terrible
suspense
when
my
pursuers
came
into
such
close
vicinity
that
i
concluded
they
had
tracked
me
to
my
i
flew
out
of
the
house
and
concealed
myself
in
a
thicket
of
bushes
there
i
remained
in
an
agony
of
fear
for
two
hours
suddenly
a
reptile
of
some
kind
seized
my
leg
in
my
fright
i
struck
a
blow
which
loosened
its
hold
but
i
could
not
tell
whether
i
had
killed
it
it
was
so
dark
i
could
not
see
what
it
was
i
only
knew
it
was
something
cold
and
slimy
the
pain
i
felt
soon
indicated
that
the
bite
was
poisonous
i
was
compelled
to
leave
my
place
of
concealment
and
i
groped
my
way
back
into
the
house
the
pain
had
become
intense
and
my
friend
was
startled
by
my
look
of
anguish
i
asked
her
to
prepare
a
poultice
of
warm
ashes
and
vinegar
and
i
applied
it
to
my
leg
which
was
already
much
swollen
the
application
gave
me
some
relief
but
the
swelling
did
not
abate
the
dread
of
being
disabled
was
greater
than
the
physical
pain
i
endured
my
friend
asked
an
old
woman
who
doctored
among
the
slaves
what
was
good
for
the
bite
of
a
snake
or
a
lizard
she
told
her
to
steep
a
dozen
coppers
in
vinegar
over
night
and
apply
the
cankered
vinegar
to
the
inflamed
part
footnote
the
poison
of
a
snake
is
a
powerful
acid
and
is
counteracted
by
powerful
alkalies
such
as
potash
ammonia
the
indians
are
accustomed
to
apply
wet
ashes
or
plunge
the
limb
into
strong
lie
white
men
employed
to
lay
out
railroads
in
snaky
places
often
carry
ammonia
with
them
as
an
editor
i
had
succeeded
in
cautiously
conveying
some
messages
to
my
relatives
they
were
harshly
threatened
and
despairing
of
my
having
a
chance
to
escape
they
advised
me
to
return
to
my
master
ask
his
forgiveness
and
let
him
make
an
example
of
me
but
such
counsel
had
no
influence
with
me
when
i
started
upon
this
hazardous
undertaking
i
had
resolved
that
come
what
would
there
should
be
no
turning
back
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
was
my
motto
when
my
friend
contrived
to
make
known
to
my
relatives
the
painful
situation
i
had
been
in
for
hours
they
said
no
more
about
my
going
back
to
my
master
something
must
be
done
and
that
speedily
but
where
to
return
for
help
they
knew
not
god
in
his
mercy
raised
up
a
friend
in
need
among
the
ladies
who
were
acquainted
with
my
grandmother
was
one
who
had
known
her
from
childhood
and
always
been
very
friendly
to
her
she
had
also
known
my
mother
and
her
children
and
felt
interested
for
them
at
this
crisis
of
affairs
she
called
to
see
my
grandmother
as
she
not
unfrequently
did
she
observed
the
sad
and
troubled
expression
of
her
face
and
asked
if
she
knew
where
linda
was
and
whether
she
was
safe
my
grandmother
shook
her
head
without
answering
come
aunt
martha
said
the
kind
lady
tell
me
all
about
it
perhaps
i
can
do
something
to
help
you
the
husband
of
this
lady
held
many
slaves
and
bought
and
sold
slaves
she
also
held
a
number
in
her
own
name
but
she
treated
them
kindly
and
would
never
allow
any
of
them
to
be
sold
she
was
unlike
the
majority
of
slaveholders
wives
my
grandmother
looked
earnestly
at
her
something
in
the
expression
of
her
face
said
trust
me
and
she
did
trust
her
she
listened
attentively
to
the
details
of
my
story
and
sat
thinking
for
a
while
at
last
she
said
aunt
martha
i
pity
you
both
if
you
think
there
is
any
chance
of
getting
to
the
free
states
i
will
conceal
her
for
a
time
but
first
you
must
solemnly
promise
that
my
name
shall
never
be
mentioned
if
such
a
thing
should
become
known
it
would
ruin
me
and
my
family
no
one
in
my
house
must
know
of
it
except
the
cook
she
is
so
faithful
that
i
would
trust
my
own
life
with
her
and
i
know
she
likes
linda
it
is
a
great
risk
but
i
trust
no
harm
will
come
of
it
get
word
to
linda
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
before
the
patrols
are
out
i
will
send
the
housemaids
on
errands
and
betty
shall
go
to
meet
linda
the
place
where
we
were
to
meet
was
designated
and
agreed
upon
my
grandmother
was
unable
to
thank
the
lady
for
this
noble
deed
overcome
by
her
emotions
she
sank
on
her
knees
and
sobbed
like
a
child
i
received
a
message
to
leave
my
friend
house
at
such
an
hour
and
go
to
a
certain
place
where
a
friend
would
be
waiting
for
me
as
a
matter
of
prudence
no
names
were
mentioned
i
had
no
means
of
conjecturing
who
i
was
to
meet
or
where
i
was
going
i
did
not
like
to
move
thus
blindfolded
but
i
had
no
choice
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
remain
where
i
was
i
disguised
myself
summoned
up
courage
to
meet
the
worst
and
went
to
the
appointed
place
my
friend
betty
was
there
she
was
the
last
person
i
expected
to
see
we
hurried
along
in
silence
the
pain
in
my
leg
was
so
intense
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
should
drop
but
fear
gave
me
strength
we
reached
the
house
and
entered
unobserved
her
first
words
were
honey
now
you
is
safe
dem
devils
ai
coming
to
search
house
when
i
get
you
into
missis
safe
place
i
will
bring
some
nice
hot
supper
i
specs
you
need
it
after
all
dis
skeering
betty
vocation
led
her
to
think
eating
the
most
important
thing
in
life
she
did
not
realize
that
my
heart
was
too
full
for
me
to
care
much
about
supper
the
mistress
came
to
meet
us
and
led
me
up
stairs
to
a
small
room
over
her
own
sleeping
apartment
you
will
be
safe
here
linda
said
she
i
keep
this
room
to
store
away
things
that
are
out
of
use
the
girls
are
not
accustomed
to
be
sent
to
it
and
they
will
not
suspect
any
thing
unless
they
hear
some
noise
i
always
keep
it
locked
and
betty
shall
take
care
of
the
key
but
you
must
be
very
careful
for
my
sake
as
well
as
your
own
and
you
must
never
tell
my
secret
for
it
would
ruin
me
and
my
family
i
will
keep
the
girls
busy
in
the
morning
that
betty
may
have
a
chance
to
bring
your
breakfast
but
it
will
not
do
for
her
to
come
to
you
again
till
night
i
will
come
to
see
you
sometimes
keep
up
your
courage
i
hope
this
state
of
things
will
not
last
long
betty
came
with
the
nice
hot
supper
and
the
mistress
hastened
down
stairs
to
keep
things
straight
till
she
returned
how
my
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
words
choked
in
my
throat
but
i
could
have
kissed
the
feet
of
my
benefactress
for
that
deed
of
christian
womanhood
may
god
forever
bless
her
i
went
to
sleep
that
night
with
the
feeling
that
i
was
for
the
present
the
most
fortunate
slave
in
town
morning
came
and
filled
my
little
cell
with
light
i
thanked
the
heavenly
father
for
this
safe
retreat
opposite
my
window
was
a
pile
of
feather
beds
on
the
top
of
these
i
could
lie
perfectly
concealed
and
command
a
view
of
the
street
through
which
flint
passed
to
his
office
anxious
as
i
was
i
felt
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
when
i
saw
him
thus
far
i
had
outwitted
him
and
i
triumphed
over
it
who
can
blame
slaves
for
being
cunning
they
are
constantly
compelled
to
resort
to
it
it
is
the
only
weapon
of
the
weak
and
oppressed
against
the
strength
of
their
tyrants
i
was
daily
hoping
to
hear
that
my
master
had
sold
my
children
for
i
knew
who
was
on
the
watch
to
buy
them
but
flint
cared
even
more
for
revenge
than
he
did
for
money
my
brother
william
and
the
good
aunt
who
had
served
in
his
family
twenty
years
and
my
little
benny
and
ellen
who
was
a
little
over
two
years
old
were
thrust
into
jail
as
a
means
of
compelling
my
relatives
to
give
some
information
about
me
he
swore
my
grandmother
should
never
see
one
of
them
again
till
i
was
brought
back
they
kept
these
facts
from
me
for
several
days
when
i
heard
that
my
little
ones
were
in
a
loathsome
jail
my
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
them
i
was
encountering
dangers
for
the
sake
of
freeing
them
and
must
i
be
the
cause
of
their
death
the
thought
was
agonizing
my
benefactress
tried
to
soothe
me
by
telling
me
that
my
aunt
would
take
good
care
of
the
children
while
they
remained
in
jail
but
it
added
to
my
pain
to
think
that
the
good
old
aunt
who
had
always
been
so
kind
to
her
sister
orphan
children
should
be
shut
up
in
prison
for
no
other
crime
than
loving
them
i
suppose
my
friends
feared
a
reckless
movement
on
my
part
knowing
as
they
did
that
my
life
was
bound
up
in
my
children
i
received
a
note
from
my
brother
william
it
was
scarcely
legible
and
ran
thus
wherever
you
are
dear
sister
i
beg
of
you
not
to
come
here
we
are
all
much
better
off
than
you
are
if
you
come
you
will
ruin
us
all
they
would
force
you
to
tell
where
you
had
been
or
they
would
kill
you
take
the
advice
of
your
friends
if
not
for
the
sake
of
me
and
your
children
at
least
for
the
sake
of
those
you
would
ruin
poor
william
he
also
must
suffer
for
being
my
brother
i
took
his
advice
and
kept
quiet
my
aunt
was
taken
out
of
jail
at
the
end
of
a
month
because
flint
could
not
spare
her
any
longer
she
was
tired
of
being
her
own
housekeeper
it
was
quite
too
fatiguing
to
order
her
dinner
and
eat
it
too
my
children
remained
in
jail
where
brother
william
did
all
he
could
for
their
comfort
betty
went
to
see
them
sometimes
and
brought
me
tidings
she
was
not
permitted
to
enter
the
jail
but
william
would
hold
them
up
to
the
grated
window
while
she
chatted
with
them
when
she
repeated
their
prattle
and
told
me
how
they
wanted
to
see
their
ma
my
tears
would
flow
old
betty
would
exclaim
lors
chile
what
you
crying
dem
young
uns
vil
kill
you
dead
do
be
so
hearted
if
you
does
you
vil
nebber
git
thro
dis
world
good
old
soul
she
had
gone
through
the
world
childless
she
had
never
had
little
ones
to
clasp
their
arms
round
her
neck
she
had
never
seen
their
soft
eyes
looking
into
hers
no
sweet
little
voices
had
called
her
mother
she
had
never
pressed
her
own
infants
to
her
heart
with
the
feeling
that
even
in
fetters
there
was
something
to
live
for
how
could
she
realize
my
feelings
betty
husband
loved
children
dearly
and
wondered
why
god
had
denied
them
to
him
he
expressed
great
sorrow
when
he
came
to
betty
with
the
tidings
that
ellen
had
been
taken
out
of
jail
and
carried
to
flint
she
had
the
measles
a
short
time
before
they
carried
her
to
jail
and
the
disease
had
left
her
eyes
affected
the
doctor
had
taken
her
home
to
attend
to
them
my
children
had
always
been
afraid
of
the
doctor
and
his
wife
they
had
never
been
inside
of
their
house
poor
little
ellen
cried
all
day
to
be
carried
back
to
prison
the
instincts
of
childhood
are
true
she
knew
she
was
loved
in
the
jail
her
screams
and
sobs
annoyed
flint
before
night
she
called
one
of
the
slaves
and
said
here
bill
carry
this
brat
back
to
the
jail
i
ca
stand
her
noise
if
she
would
be
quiet
i
should
like
to
keep
the
little
minx
she
would
make
a
handy
for
my
daughter
by
and
by
but
if
she
staid
here
with
her
white
face
i
suppose
i
should
either
kill
her
or
spoil
her
i
hope
the
doctor
will
sell
them
as
far
as
wind
and
water
can
carry
them
as
for
their
mother
her
ladyship
will
find
out
yet
what
she
gets
by
running
away
she
has
so
much
feeling
for
her
children
as
a
cow
has
for
its
calf
if
she
had
she
would
have
come
back
long
ago
to
get
them
out
of
jail
and
save
all
this
expense
and
trouble
the
hussy
when
she
is
caught
she
shall
stay
in
jail
in
irons
for
one
six
months
and
then
be
sold
to
a
sugar
plantation
i
shall
see
her
broke
in
yet
what
do
you
stand
there
for
bill
why
do
you
go
off
with
the
brat
mind
now
that
you
do
let
any
of
the
niggers
speak
to
her
in
the
street
when
these
remarks
were
reported
to
me
i
smiled
at
flint
saying
that
she
should
either
kill
my
child
or
spoil
her
i
thought
to
myself
there
was
very
little
danger
of
the
latter
i
have
always
considered
it
as
one
of
god
special
providences
that
ellen
screamed
till
she
was
carried
back
to
jail
that
same
night
flint
was
called
to
a
patient
and
did
not
return
till
near
morning
passing
my
grandmother
he
saw
a
light
in
the
house
and
thought
to
himself
perhaps
this
has
something
to
do
with
linda
he
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
what
calls
you
up
so
early
said
he
i
saw
your
light
and
i
thought
i
would
just
stop
and
tell
you
that
i
have
found
out
where
linda
is
i
know
where
to
put
my
hands
on
her
and
i
shall
have
her
before
twelve
when
he
had
turned
away
my
grandmother
and
my
uncle
looked
anxiously
at
each
other
they
did
not
know
whether
or
not
it
was
merely
one
of
the
doctor
tricks
to
frighten
them
in
their
uncertainty
they
thought
it
was
best
to
have
a
message
conveyed
to
my
friend
betty
unwilling
to
alarm
her
mistress
betty
resolved
to
dispose
of
me
herself
she
came
to
me
and
told
me
to
rise
and
dress
quickly
we
hurried
down
stairs
and
across
the
yard
into
the
kitchen
she
locked
the
door
and
lifted
up
a
plank
in
the
floor
a
buffalo
skin
and
a
bit
of
carpet
were
spread
for
me
to
lie
on
and
a
quilt
thrown
over
me
stay

said
she
till

got
to
say
if

rummagin
tings

one
bressed
sarssin
from
dis
nigger
in
my
shallow
bed
i
had
but
just
room
enough
to
bring
my
hands
to
my
face
to
keep
the
dust
out
of
my
eyes
for
betty
walked
over
me
twenty
times
in
an
hour
passing
from
the
dresser
to
the
fireplace
when
she
was
alone
i
could
hear
her
pronouncing
anathemas
over
flint
and
all
his
tribe
every
now
and
then
saying
with
a
chuckling
laugh
dis
nigger
too
cute
for
dis
time
when
the
housemaids
were
about
she
had
sly
ways
of
drawing
them
out
that
i
might
hear
what
they
would
say
she
would
repeat
stories
she
had
heard
about
my
being
in
this
or
that
or
the
other
place
to
which
they
would
answer
that
i
was
not
fool
enough
to
be
staying
round
there
that
i
was
in
philadelphia
or
new
york
before
this
time
when
all
were
abed
and
asleep
betty
raised
the
plank
and
said
come
out
chile
come
out
dey
do
know
nottin
you
twas
only
white
folks
lies
to
skeer
de
niggers
some
days
after
this
adventure
i
had
a
much
worse
fright
as
i
sat
very
still
in
my
retreat
above
stairs
cheerful
visions
floated
through
my
mind
i
thought
flint
would
soon
get
discouraged
and
would
be
willing
to
sell
my
children
when
he
lost
all
hopes
of
making
them
the
means
of
my
discovery
i
knew
who
was
ready
to
buy
them
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
that
chilled
my
blood
the
sound
was
too
familiar
to
me
it
had
been
too
dreadful
for
me
not
to
recognize
at
once
my
old
master
he
was
in
the
house
and
i
at
once
concluded
he
had
come
to
seize
me
i
looked
round
in
terror
there
was
no
way
of
escape
the
voice
receded
i
supposed
the
constable
was
with
him
and
they
were
searching
the
house
in
my
alarm
i
did
not
forget
the
trouble
i
was
bringing
on
my
generous
benefactress
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
born
to
bring
sorrow
on
all
who
befriended
me
and
that
was
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
bitter
cup
of
my
life
after
a
while
i
heard
approaching
footsteps
the
key
was
turned
in
my
door
i
braced
myself
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
falling
i
ventured
to
look
up
and
there
stood
my
kind
benefactress
alone
i
was
too
much
overcome
to
speak
and
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
i
thought
you
would
hear
your
master
voice
she
said
and
knowing
you
would
be
terrified
i
came
to
tell
you
there
is
nothing
to
fear
you
may
even
indulge
in
a
laugh
at
the
old
gentleman
expense
he
is
so
sure
you
are
in
new
york
that
he
came
to
borrow
five
hundred
dollars
to
go
in
pursuit
of
you
my
sister
had
some
money
to
loan
on
interest
he
has
obtained
it
and
proposes
to
start
for
new
york
so
for
the
present
you
see
you
are
safe
the
doctor
will
merely
lighten
his
pocket
hunting
after
the
bird
he
has
left
behind
xix
the
children
sold
the
doctor
came
back
from
new
york
of
course
without
accomplishing
his
purpose
he
had
expended
considerable
money
and
was
rather
disheartened
my
brother
and
the
children
had
now
been
in
jail
two
months
and
that
also
was
some
expense
my
friends
thought
it
was
a
favorable
time
to
work
on
his
discouraged
feelings
sands
sent
a
speculator
to
offer
him
nine
hundred
dollars
for
my
brother
william
and
eight
hundred
for
the
two
children
these
were
high
prices
as
slaves
were
then
selling
but
the
offer
was
rejected
if
it
had
been
merely
a
question
of
money
the
doctor
would
have
sold
any
boy
of
benny
age
for
two
hundred
dollars
but
he
could
not
bear
to
give
up
the
power
of
revenge
but
he
was
hard
pressed
for
money
and
he
revolved
the
matter
in
his
mind
he
knew
that
if
he
could
keep
ellen
till
she
was
fifteen
he
could
sell
her
for
a
high
price
but
i
presume
he
reflected
that
she
might
die
or
might
be
stolen
away
at
all
events
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
better
accept
the
offer
meeting
him
in
the
street
he
inquired
when
he
would
leave
town
at
ten
he
replied
ah
do
you
go
so
soon
said
the
doctor
i
have
been
reflecting
upon
your
proposition
and
i
have
concluded
to
let
you
have
the
three
negroes
if
you
will
say
nineteen
hundred
dollars
after
some
parley
the
trader
agreed
to
his
terms
he
wanted
the
bill
of
sale
drawn
up
and
signed
immediately
as
he
had
a
great
deal
to
attend
to
during
the
short
time
he
remained
in
town
the
doctor
went
to
the
jail
and
told
william
he
would
take
him
back
into
his
service
if
he
would
promise
to
behave
himself
but
he
replied
that
he
would
rather
be
sold
and
you
be
sold
you
ungrateful
rascal
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
less
than
an
hour
the
money
was
paid
the
papers
were
signed
sealed
and
delivered
and
my
brother
and
children
were
in
the
hands
of
the
trader
it
was
a
hurried
transaction
and
after
it
was
over
the
characteristic
caution
returned
he
went
back
to
the
speculator
and
said
sir
i
have
come
to
lay
you
under
obligations
of
a
thousand
dollars
not
to
sell
any
of
those
negroes
in
this
state
you
come
too
late
replied
the
trader
our
bargain
is
closed
he
had
in
fact
already
sold
them
to
sands
but
he
did
not
mention
it
the
doctor
required
him
to
put
irons
on
that
rascal
bill
and
to
pass
through
the
back
streets
when
he
took
his
gang
out
of
town
the
trader
was
privately
instructed
to
concede
to
his
wishes
my
good
old
aunt
went
to
the
jail
to
bid
the
children
good
by
supposing
them
to
be
the
speculator
property
and
that
she
should
never
see
them
again
as
she
held
benny
in
her
lap
he
said
aunt
nancy
i
want
to
show
you
something
he
led
her
to
the
door
and
showed
her
a
long
row
of
marks
saying
uncle
will
taught
me
to
count
i
have
made
a
mark
for
every
day
i
have
been
here
and
it
is
sixty
days
it
is
a
long
time
and
the
speculator
is
going
to
take
me
and
ellen
away
he
a
bad
man
it
wrong
for
him
to
take
grandmother
children
i
want
to
go
to
my
mother
my
grandmother
was
told
that
the
children
would
be
restored
to
her
but
she
was
requested
to
act
as
if
they
were
really
to
be
sent
away
accordingly
she
made
up
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
went
to
the
jail
when
she
arrived
she
found
william
handcuffed
among
the
gang
and
the
children
in
the
cart
the
scene
seemed
too
much
like
reality
she
was
afraid
there
might
have
been
some
deception
or
mistake
she
fainted
and
was
carried
home
when
the
wagon
stopped
at
the
hotel
several
gentlemen
came
out
and
proposed
to
purchase
william
but
the
trader
refused
their
offers
without
stating
that
he
was
already
sold
and
now
came
the
trying
hour
for
that
drove
of
human
beings
driven
away
like
cattle
to
be
sold
they
knew
not
where
husbands
were
torn
from
wives
parents
from
children
never
to
look
upon
each
other
again
this
side
the
grave
there
was
wringing
of
hands
and
cries
of
despair
flint
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
wagon
leave
town
and
flint
had
the
gratification
of
supposing
that
my
children
were
going
as
far
as
wind
and
water
would
carry
them
according
to
agreement
my
uncle
followed
the
wagon
some
miles
until
they
came
to
an
old
farm
house
there
the
trader
took
the
irons
from
william
and
as
he
did
so
he
said
you
are
a
damned
clever
fellow
i
should
like
to
own
you
myself
them
gentlemen
that
wanted
to
buy
you
said
you
was
a
bright
honest
chap
and
i
must
git
you
a
good
home
i
guess
your
old
master
will
swear
and
call
himself
an
old
fool
for
selling
the
children
i
reckon
he
never
git
their
mammy
back
again
i
expect
she
made
tracks
for
the
north
good
by
old
boy
remember
i
have
done
you
a
good
turn
you
must
thank
me
by
coaxing
all
the
pretty
gals
to
go
with
me
next
fall
that
going
to
be
my
last
trip
this
trading
in
niggers
is
a
bad
business
for
a
fellow
got
any
heart
move
on
you
fellows
and
the
gang
went
on
god
alone
knows
where
much
as
i
despise
and
detest
the
class
of
whom
i
regard
as
the
vilest
wretches
on
earth
i
must
do
this
man
the
justice
to
say
that
he
seemed
to
have
some
feeling
he
took
a
fancy
to
william
in
the
jail
and
wanted
to
buy
him
when
he
heard
the
story
of
my
children
he
was
willing
to
aid
them
in
getting
out
of
flint
power
even
without
charging
the
customary
fee
my
uncle
procured
a
wagon
and
carried
william
and
the
children
back
to
town
great
was
the
joy
in
my
grandmother
house
the
curtains
were
closed
and
the
candles
lighted
the
happy
grandmother
cuddled
the
little
ones
to
her
bosom
they
hugged
her
and
kissed
her
and
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
she
knelt
down
and
poured
forth
one
of
her
heartfelt
prayers
of
thanksgiving
to
god
the
father
was
present
for
a
while
and
though
such
a
parental
relation
as
existed
between
him
and
my
children
takes
slight
hold
on
the
hearts
or
consciences
of
slaveholders
it
must
be
that
he
experienced
some
moments
of
pure
joy
in
witnessing
the
happiness
he
had
imparted
i
had
no
share
in
the
rejoicings
of
that
evening
the
events
of
the
day
had
not
come
to
my
knowledge
and
now
i
will
tell
you
something
that
happened
to
me
though
you
will
perhaps
think
it
illustrates
the
superstition
of
slaves
i
sat
in
my
usual
place
on
the
floor
near
the
window
where
i
could
hear
much
that
was
said
in
the
street
without
being
seen
the
family
had
retired
for
the
night
and
all
was
still
i
sat
there
thinking
of
my
children
when
i
heard
a
low
strain
of
music
a
band
of
serenaders
were
under
the
window
playing
home
sweet
home
i
listened
till
the
sounds
did
not
seem
like
music
but
like
the
moaning
of
children
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
would
burst
i
rose
from
my
sitting
posture
and
knelt
a
streak
of
moonlight
was
on
the
floor
before
me
and
in
the
midst
of
it
appeared
the
forms
of
my
two
children
they
vanished
but
i
had
seen
them
distinctly
some
will
call
it
a
dream
others
a
vision
i
know
not
how
to
account
for
it
but
it
made
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
and
i
felt
certain
something
had
happened
to
my
little
ones
i
had
not
seen
betty
since
morning
now
i
heard
her
softly
turning
the
key
as
soon
as
she
entered
i
clung
to
her
and
begged
her
to
let
me
know
whether
my
children
were
dead
or
whether
they
were
sold
for
i
had
seen
their
spirits
in
my
room
and
i
was
sure
something
had
happened
to
them
lor

her
arms

tried
to
obey
her
she
lay
down
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
but
no
sleep
would
come
to
my
eyelids
at
dawn
betty
was
up
and
off
to
the
kitchen
the
hours
passed
on
and
the
vision
of
the
night
kept
constantly
recurring
to
my
thoughts
after
a
while
i
heard
the
voices
of
two
women
in
the
entry
in
one
of
them
i
recognized
the
housemaid
the
other
said
to
her

and

to
myself
can

be
true
that
my
children
are
free
i
have
not
suffered
for
them
in
vain
thank
god
great
surprise
was
expressed
when
it
was
known
that
my
children
had
returned
to
their
grandmother
the
news
spread
through
the
town
and
many
a
kind
word
was
bestowed
on
the
little
ones
flint
went
to
my
grandmother
to
ascertain
who
was
the
owner
of
my
children
and
she
informed
him
i
expected
as
much
said
he
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
have
had
news
from
linda
lately
and
i
shall
soon
have
her
you
need
never
expect
to
see
free
she
shall
be
my
slave
as
long
as
i
live
and
when
i
am
dead
she
shall
be
the
slave
of
my
children
if
i
ever
find
out
that
you
or
phillip
had
anything
to
do
with
her
running
off
kill
him
and
if
i
meet
william
in
the
street
and
he
presumes
to
look
at
me
i
flog
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
keep
those
brats
out
of
my
sight
as
he
turned
to
leave
my
grandmother
said
something
to
remind
him
of
his
own
doings
he
looked
back
upon
her
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
to
strike
her
to
the
ground
i
had
my
season
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
it
was
the
first
time
since
my
childhood
that
i
had
experienced
any
real
happiness
i
heard
of
the
old
doctor
threats
but
they
no
longer
had
the
same
power
to
trouble
me
the
darkest
cloud
that
hung
over
my
life
had
rolled
away
whatever
slavery
might
do
to
me
it
could
not
shackle
my
children
if
i
fell
a
sacrifice
my
little
ones
were
saved
it
was
well
for
me
that
my
simple
heart
believed
all
that
had
been
promised
for
their
welfare
it
is
always
better
to
trust
than
to
doubt
xx
new
perils
the
doctor
more
exasperated
than
ever
again
tried
to
revenge
himself
on
my
relatives
he
arrested
uncle
phillip
on
the
charge
of
having
aided
my
flight
he
was
carried
before
a
court
and
swore
truly
that
he
knew
nothing
of
my
intention
to
escape
and
that
he
had
not
seen
me
since
i
left
my
master
plantation
the
doctor
then
demanded
that
he
should
give
bail
for
five
hundred
dollars
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
several
gentlemen
offered
to
be
security
for
him
but
sands
told
him
he
had
better
go
back
to
jail
and
he
would
see
that
he
came
out
without
giving
bail
the
news
of
his
arrest
was
carried
to
my
grandmother
who
conveyed
it
to
betty
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
she
again
stowed
me
away
under
the
floor
and
as
she
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
performance
of
her
culinary
duties
she
talked
apparently
to
herself
but
with
the
intention
that
i
should
hear
what
was
going
on
i
hoped
that
my
uncle
imprisonment
would
last
but
few
days
still
i
was
anxious
i
thought
it
likely
flint
would
do
his
utmost
to
taunt
and
insult
him
and
i
was
afraid
my
uncle
might
lose
control
of
himself
and
retort
in
some
way
that
would
be
construed
into
a
punishable
offence
and
i
was
well
aware
that
in
court
his
word
would
not
be
taken
against
any
white
man
the
search
for
me
was
renewed
something
had
excited
suspicions
that
i
was
in
the
vicinity
they
searched
the
house
i
was
in
i
heard
their
steps
and
their
voices
at
night
when
all
were
asleep
betty
came
to
release
me
from
my
place
of
confinement
the
fright
i
had
undergone
the
constrained
posture
and
the
dampness
of
the
ground
made
me
ill
for
several
days
my
uncle
was
soon
after
taken
out
of
prison
but
the
movements
of
all
my
relatives
and
of
all
our
friends
were
very
closely
watched
we
all
saw
that
i
could
not
remain
where
i
was
much
longer
i
had
already
staid
longer
than
was
intended
and
i
knew
my
presence
must
be
a
source
of
perpetual
anxiety
to
my
kind
benefactress
during
this
time
my
friends
had
laid
many
plans
for
my
escape
but
the
extreme
vigilance
of
my
persecutors
made
it
impossible
to
carry
them
into
effect
one
morning
i
was
much
startled
by
hearing
somebody
trying
to
get
into
my
room
several
keys
were
tried
but
none
fitted
i
instantly
conjectured
it
was
one
of
the
housemaids
and
i
concluded
she
must
either
have
heard
some
noise
in
the
room
or
have
noticed
the
entrance
of
betty
when
my
friend
came
at
her
usual
time
i
told
her
what
had
happened
i
knows
who
it
was
said
she
tend
upon
it
was
dat
jenny
dat
nigger
allers
got
de
debble
in
her
i
suggested
that
she
might
have
seen
or
heard
something
that
excited
her
curiosity
tut
tut
chile
exclaimed
betty
she
ai
seen
notin
nor
hearn
notin
she
only
something
dat
all
she
wants

cut
and
make
my
gownd
but
she
wo
nebber
know
dat
sartin
git
missis
to
fix
her
i
reflected
a
moment
and
said
betty
i
must
leave
here
do
as
you
tink
best
poor
chile
she
replied
mighty
dat
nigger
vill
pop
on
you
some
time
she
reported
the
incident
to
her
mistress
and
received
orders
to
keep
jenny
busy
in
the
kitchen
till
she
could
see
my
uncle
phillip
he
told
her
he
would
send
a
friend
for
me
that
very
evening
she
told
him
she
hoped
i
was
going
to
the
north
for
it
was
very
dangerous
for
me
to
remain
any
where
in
the
vicinity
alas
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
for
one
in
my
situation
to
go
to
the
north
in
order
to
leave
the
coast
quite
clear
for
me
she
went
into
the
country
to
spend
the
day
with
her
brother
and
took
jenny
with
her
she
was
afraid
to
come
and
bid
me
good
by
but
she
left
a
kind
message
with
betty
i
heard
her
carriage
roll
from
the
door
and
i
never
again
saw
her
who
had
so
generously
befriended
the
poor
trembling
fugitive
though
she
was
a
slaveholder
to
this
day
my
heart
blesses
her
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
i
was
going
betty
brought
me
a
suit
of
sailor
clothes
jacket
trowsers
and
tarpaulin
hat
she
gave
me
a
small
bundle
saying
i
might
need
it
where
i
was
going
in
cheery
tones
she
exclaimed
glad
you
is
gwine
to
free
parts
do
forget
ole
betty
i
come
by
and
by
i
tried
to
tell
her
how
grateful
i
felt
for
all
her
kindness
but
she
interrupted
me
i
do
want
no
tanks
honey
glad
i
could
help
you
and
i
hope
de
good
lord
vill
open
de
path
for
you
gwine
wid
you
to
de
lower
gate
put
your
hands
in
your
pockets
and
walk
ricketty
like
de
sailors
i
performed
to
her
satisfaction
at
the
gate
i
found
peter
a
young
colored
man
waiting
for
me
i
had
known
him
for
years
he
had
been
an
apprentice
to
my
father
and
had
always
borne
a
good
character
i
was
not
afraid
to
trust
to
him
betty
bade
me
a
hurried
good
by
and
we
walked
off
take
courage
linda
said
my
friend
peter
i
got
a
dagger
and
no
man
shall
take
you
from
me
unless
he
passes
over
my
dead
body
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
taken
a
walk
out
of
doors
and
the
fresh
air
revived
me
it
was
also
pleasant
to
hear
a
human
voice
speaking
to
me
above
a
whisper
i
passed
several
people
whom
i
knew
but
they
did
not
recognize
me
in
my
disguise
i
prayed
internally
that
for
peter
sake
as
well
as
my
own
nothing
might
occur
to
bring
out
his
dagger
we
walked
on
till
we
came
to
the
wharf
my
aunt
nancy
husband
was
a
seafaring
man
and
it
had
been
deemed
necessary
to
let
him
into
our
secret
he
took
me
into
his
boat
rowed
out
to
a
vessel
not
far
distant
and
hoisted
me
on
board
we
three
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
vessel
i
now
ventured
to
ask
what
they
proposed
to
do
with
me
they
said
i
was
to
remain
on
board
till
near
dawn
and
then
they
would
hide
me
in
snaky
swamp
till
my
uncle
phillip
had
prepared
a
place
of
concealment
for
me
if
the
vessel
had
been
bound
north
it
would
have
been
of
no
avail
to
me
for
it
would
certainly
have
been
searched
about
four
we
were
again
seated
in
the
boat
and
rowed
three
miles
to
the
swamp
my
fear
of
snakes
had
been
increased
by
the
venomous
bite
i
had
received
and
i
dreaded
to
enter
this
hiding
place
but
i
was
in
no
situation
to
choose
and
i
gratefully
accepted
the
best
that
my
poor
persecuted
friends
could
do
for
me
peter
landed
first
and
with
a
large
knife
cut
a
path
through
bamboos
and
briers
of
all
descriptions
he
came
back
took
me
in
his
arms
and
carried
me
to
a
seat
made
among
the
bamboos
before
we
reached
it
we
were
covered
with
hundreds
of
mosquitos
in
an
hour
time
they
had
so
poisoned
my
flesh
that
i
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
behold
as
the
light
increased
i
saw
snake
after
snake
crawling
round
us
i
had
been
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
snakes
all
my
life
but
these
were
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
to
this
day
i
shudder
when
i
remember
that
morning
as
evening
approached
the
number
of
snakes
increased
so
much
that
we
were
continually
obliged
to
thrash
them
with
sticks
to
keep
them
from
crawling
over
us
the
bamboos
were
so
high
and
so
thick
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
beyond
a
very
short
distance
just
before
it
became
dark
we
procured
a
seat
nearer
to
the
entrance
of
the
swamp
being
fearful
of
losing
our
way
back
to
the
boat
it
was
not
long
before
we
heard
the
paddle
of
oars
and
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
agreed
upon
as
a
signal
we
made
haste
to
enter
the
boat
and
were
rowed
back
to
the
vessel
i
passed
a
wretched
night
for
the
heat
of
the
swamp
the
mosquitos
and
the
constant
terror
of
snakes
had
brought
on
a
burning
fever
i
had
just
dropped
asleep
when
they
came
and
told
me
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
that
horrid
swamp
i
could
scarcely
summon
courage
to
rise
but
even
those
large
venomous
snakes
were
less
dreadful
to
my
imagination
than
the
white
men
in
that
community
called
civilized
this
time
peter
took
a
quantity
of
tobacco
to
burn
to
keep
off
the
mosquitos
it
produced
the
desired
effect
on
them
but
gave
me
nausea
and
severe
headache
at
dark
we
returned
to
the
vessel
i
had
been
so
sick
during
the
day
that
peter
declared
i
should
go
home
that
night
if
the
devil
himself
was
on
patrol
they
told
me
a
place
of
concealment
had
been
provided
for
me
at
my
grandmother
i
could
not
imagine
how
it
was
possible
to
hide
me
in
her
house
every
nook
and
corner
of
which
was
known
to
the
flint
family
they
told
me
to
wait
and
see
we
were
rowed
ashore
and
went
boldly
through
the
streets
to
my
grandmother
i
wore
my
sailor
clothes
and
had
blackened
my
face
with
charcoal
i
passed
several
people
whom
i
knew
the
father
of
my
children
came
so
near
that
i
brushed
against
his
arm
but
he
had
no
idea
who
it
was
you
must
make
the
most
of
this
walk
said
my
friend
peter
for
you
may
not
have
another
very
soon
i
thought
his
voice
sounded
sad
it
was
kind
of
him
to
conceal
from
me
what
a
dismal
hole
was
to
be
my
home
for
a
long
long
time
xxi
the
loophole
of
retreat
a
small
shed
had
been
added
to
my
grandmother
house
years
ago
some
boards
were
laid
across
the
joists
at
the
top
and
between
these
boards
and
the
roof
was
a
very
small
garret
never
occupied
by
any
thing
but
rats
and
mice
it
was
a
pent
roof
covered
with
nothing
but
shingles
according
to
the
southern
custom
for
such
buildings
the
garret
was
only
nine
feet
long
and
seven
wide
the
highest
part
was
three
feet
high
and
sloped
down
abruptly
to
the
loose
board
floor
there
was
no
admission
for
either
light
or
air
my
uncle
phillip
who
was
a
carpenter
had
very
skilfully
made
a
concealed
which
communicated
with
the
storeroom
he
had
been
doing
this
while
i
was
waiting
in
the
swamp
the
storeroom
opened
upon
a
piazza
to
this
hole
i
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
house
the
air
was
stifling
the
darkness
total
a
bed
had
been
spread
on
the
floor
i
could
sleep
quite
comfortably
on
one
side
but
the
slope
was
so
sudden
that
i
could
not
turn
on
my
other
without
hitting
the
roof
the
rats
and
mice
ran
over
my
bed
but
i
was
weary
and
i
slept
such
sleep
as
the
wretched
may
when
a
tempest
has
passed
over
them
morning
came
i
knew
it
only
by
the
noises
i
heard
for
in
my
small
den
day
and
night
were
all
the
same
i
suffered
for
air
even
more
than
for
light
but
i
was
not
comfortless
i
heard
the
voices
of
my
children
there
was
joy
and
there
was
sadness
in
the
sound
it
made
my
tears
flow
how
i
longed
to
speak
to
them
i
was
eager
to
look
on
their
faces
but
there
was
no
hole
no
crack
through
which
i
could
peep
this
continued
darkness
was
oppressive
it
seemed
horrible
to
sit
or
lie
in
a
cramped
position
day
after
day
without
one
gleam
of
light
yet
i
would
have
chosen
this
rather
than
my
lot
as
a
slave
though
white
people
considered
it
an
easy
one
and
it
was
so
compared
with
the
fate
of
others
i
was
never
cruelly
overworked
i
was
never
lacerated
with
the
whip
from
head
to
foot
i
was
never
so
beaten
and
bruised
that
i
could
not
turn
from
one
side
to
the
other
i
never
had
my
cut
to
prevent
my
running
away
i
was
never
chained
to
a
log
and
forced
to
drag
it
about
while
i
toiled
in
the
fields
from
morning
till
night
i
was
never
branded
with
hot
iron
or
torn
by
bloodhounds
on
the
contrary
i
had
always
been
kindly
treated
and
tenderly
cared
for
until
i
came
into
the
hands
of
flint
i
had
never
wished
for
freedom
till
then
but
though
my
life
in
slavery
was
comparatively
devoid
of
hardships
god
pity
the
woman
who
is
compelled
to
lead
such
a
life
my
food
was
passed
up
to
me
through
the
my
uncle
had
contrived
and
my
grandmother
my
uncle
phillip
and
aunt
nancy
would
seize
such
opportunities
as
they
could
to
mount
up
there
and
chat
with
me
at
the
opening
but
of
course
this
was
not
safe
in
the
daytime
it
must
all
be
done
in
darkness
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
move
in
an
erect
position
but
i
crawled
about
my
den
for
exercise
one
day
i
hit
my
head
against
something
and
found
it
was
a
gimlet
my
uncle
had
left
it
sticking
there
when
he
made
the
i
was
as
rejoiced
as
robinson
crusoe
could
have
been
at
finding
such
a
treasure
it
put
a
lucky
thought
into
my
head
i
said
to
myself
now
i
will
have
some
light
now
i
will
see
my
children
i
did
not
dare
to
begin
my
work
during
the
daytime
for
fear
of
attracting
attention
but
i
groped
round
and
having
found
the
side
next
the
street
where
i
could
frequently
see
my
children
i
stuck
the
gimlet
in
and
waited
for
evening
i
bored
three
rows
of
holes
one
above
another
then
i
bored
out
the
interstices
between
i
thus
succeeded
in
making
one
hole
about
an
inch
long
and
an
inch
broad
i
sat
by
it
till
late
into
the
night
to
enjoy
the
little
whiff
of
air
that
floated
in
in
the
morning
i
watched
for
my
children
the
first
person
i
saw
in
the
street
was
flint
i
had
a
shuddering
superstitious
feeling
that
it
was
a
bad
omen
several
familiar
faces
passed
by
at
last
i
heard
the
merry
laugh
of
children
and
presently
two
sweet
little
faces
were
looking
up
at
me
as
though
they
knew
i
was
there
and
were
conscious
of
the
joy
they
imparted
how
i
longed
to
them
i
was
there
my
condition
was
now
a
little
improved
but
for
weeks
i
was
tormented
by
hundreds
of
little
red
insects
fine
as
a
needle
point
that
pierced
through
my
skin
and
produced
an
intolerable
burning
the
good
grandmother
gave
me
herb
teas
and
cooling
medicines
and
finally
i
got
rid
of
them
the
heat
of
my
den
was
intense
for
nothing
but
thin
shingles
protected
me
from
the
scorching
summer
sun
but
i
had
my
consolations
through
my
i
could
watch
the
children
and
when
they
were
near
enough
i
could
hear
their
talk
aunt
nancy
brought
me
all
the
news
she
could
hear
at
flint
from
her
i
learned
that
the
doctor
had
written
to
new
york
to
a
colored
woman
who
had
been
born
and
raised
in
our
neighborhood
and
had
breathed
his
contaminating
atmosphere
he
offered
her
a
reward
if
she
could
find
out
any
thing
about
me
i
know
not
what
was
the
nature
of
her
reply
but
he
soon
after
started
for
new
york
in
haste
saying
to
his
family
that
he
had
business
of
importance
to
transact
i
peeped
at
him
as
he
passed
on
his
way
to
the
steamboat
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
have
miles
of
land
and
water
between
us
even
for
a
little
while
and
it
was
a
still
greater
satisfaction
to
know
that
he
believed
me
to
be
in
the
free
states
my
little
den
seemed
less
dreary
than
it
had
done
he
returned
as
he
did
from
his
former
journey
to
new
york
without
obtaining
any
satisfactory
information
when
he
passed
our
house
next
morning
benny
was
standing
at
the
gate
he
had
heard
them
say
that
he
had
gone
to
find
me
and
he
called
out
flint
did
you
bring
my
mother
home
i
want
to
see
her
the
doctor
stamped
his
foot
at
him
in
a
rage
and
exclaimed
get
out
of
the
way
you
little
damned
rascal
if
you
do
i
cut
off
your
head
benny
ran
terrified
into
the
house
saying
you
ca
put
me
in
jail
again
i
do
belong
to
you
now
it
was
well
that
the
wind
carried
the
words
away
from
the
doctor
ear
i
told
my
grandmother
of
it
when
we
had
our
next
conference
at
the
and
begged
of
her
not
to
allow
the
children
to
be
impertinent
to
the
irascible
old
man
autumn
came
with
a
pleasant
abatement
of
heat
my
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
and
by
holding
my
book
or
work
in
a
certain
position
near
the
aperture
i
contrived
to
read
and
sew
that
was
a
great
relief
to
the
tedious
monotony
of
my
life
but
when
winter
came
the
cold
penetrated
through
the
thin
shingle
roof
and
i
was
dreadfully
chilled
the
winters
there
are
not
so
long
or
so
severe
as
in
northern
latitudes
but
the
houses
are
not
built
to
shelter
from
cold
and
my
little
den
was
peculiarly
comfortless
the
kind
grandmother
brought
me
bedclothes
and
warm
drinks
often
i
was
obliged
to
lie
in
bed
all
day
to
keep
comfortable
but
with
all
my
precautions
my
shoulders
and
feet
were
frostbitten
o
those
long
gloomy
days
with
no
object
for
my
eye
to
rest
upon
and
no
thoughts
to
occupy
my
mind
except
the
dreary
past
and
the
uncertain
future
i
was
thankful
when
there
came
a
day
sufficiently
mild
for
me
to
wrap
myself
up
and
sit
at
the
loophole
to
watch
the
passers
by
southerners
have
the
habit
of
stopping
and
talking
in
the
streets
and
i
heard
many
conversations
not
intended
to
meet
my
ears
i
heard
planning
how
to
catch
some
poor
fugitive
several
times
i
heard
allusions
to
flint
myself
and
the
history
of
my
children
who
perhaps
were
playing
near
the
gate
one
would
say
i
would
move
my
little
finger
to
catch
her
as
old
property
another
would
say
i
catch
nigger
for
the
reward
a
man
ought
to
have
what
belongs
to
him
if
he
a
damned
brute
the
opinion
was
often
expressed
that
i
was
in
the
free
states
very
rarely
did
any
one
suggest
that
i
might
be
in
the
vicinity
had
the
least
suspicion
rested
on
my
grandmother
house
it
would
have
been
burned
to
the
ground
but
it
was
the
last
place
they
thought
of
yet
there
was
no
place
where
slavery
existed
that
could
have
afforded
me
so
good
a
place
of
concealment
flint
and
his
family
repeatedly
tried
to
coax
and
bribe
my
children
to
tell
something
they
had
heard
said
about
me
one
day
the
doctor
took
them
into
a
shop
and
offered
them
some
bright
little
silver
pieces
and
gay
handkerchiefs
if
they
would
tell
where
their
mother
was
ellen
shrank
away
from
him
and
would
not
speak
but
benny
spoke
up
and
said
flint
i
do
know
where
my
mother
is
i
guess
she
in
new
york
and
when
you
go
there
again
i
wish
you
ask
her
to
come
home
for
i
want
to
see
her
but
if
you
put
her
in
jail
or
tell
her
you
cut
her
head
off
i
tell
her
to
go
right
back
xxii
christmas
festivities
christmas
was
approaching
grandmother
brought
me
materials
and
i
busied
myself
making
some
new
garments
and
little
playthings
for
my
children
were
it
not
that
hiring
day
is
near
at
hand
and
many
families
are
fearfully
looking
forward
to
the
probability
of
separation
in
a
few
days
christmas
might
be
a
happy
season
for
the
poor
slaves
even
slave
mothers
try
to
gladden
the
hearts
of
their
little
ones
on
that
occasion
benny
and
ellen
had
their
christmas
stockings
filled
their
imprisoned
mother
could
not
have
the
privilege
of
witnessing
their
surprise
and
joy
but
i
had
the
pleasure
of
peeping
at
them
as
they
went
into
the
street
with
their
new
suits
on
i
heard
benny
ask
a
little
playmate
whether
santa
claus
brought
him
any
thing
yes
replied
the
boy
but
santa
claus
ai
a
real
man
it
the
children
mothers
that
put
things
into
the
stockings
no
that
ca
be
replied
benny
for
santa
claus
brought
ellen
and
me
these
new
clothes
and
my
mother
has
been
gone
this
long
time
how
i
longed
to
tell
him
that
his
mother
made
those
garments
and
that
many
a
tear
fell
on
them
while
she
worked
every
child
rises
early
on
christmas
morning
to
see
the
johnkannaus
without
them
christmas
would
be
shorn
of
its
greatest
attraction
they
consist
of
companies
of
slaves
from
the
plantations
generally
of
the
lower
class
two
athletic
men
in
calico
wrappers
have
a
net
thrown
over
them
covered
with
all
manner
of
stripes
cows
tails
are
fastened
to
their
backs
and
their
heads
are
decorated
with
horns
a
box
covered
with
sheepskin
is
called
the
gumbo
box
a
dozen
beat
on
this
while
other
strike
triangles
and
jawbones
to
which
bands
of
dancers
keep
time
for
a
month
previous
they
are
composing
songs
which
are
sung
on
this
occasion
these
companies
of
a
hundred
each
turn
out
early
in
the
morning
and
are
allowed
to
go
round
till
twelve
begging
for
contributions
not
a
door
is
left
unvisited
where
there
is
the
least
chance
of
obtaining
a
penny
or
a
glass
of
rum
they
do
not
drink
while
they
are
out
but
carry
the
rum
home
in
jugs
to
have
a
carousal
these
christmas
donations
frequently
amount
to
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
it
is
seldom
that
any
white
man
or
child
refuses
to
give
them
a
trifle
if
he
does
they
regale
his
ears
with
the
following
song
poor
massa
so
dey
say

in
de
heel
so
dey
say
got
no
money
so
dey

shillin
so
dey
say
god
bress
you
so
dey
say
christmas
is
a
day
of
feasting
both
with
white
and
colored
people
slaves
who
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
few
shillings
are
sure
to
spend
them
for
good
eating
and
many
a
turkey
and
pig
is
captured
without
saying
by
your
leave
sir
those
who
can
not
obtain
these
cook
a
or
a
raccoon
from
which
savory
dishes
can
be
made
my
grandmother
raised
poultry
and
pigs
for
sale
and
it
was
her
established
custom
to
have
both
a
turkey
and
a
pig
roasted
for
christmas
dinner
on
this
occasion
i
was
warned
to
keep
extremely
quiet
because
two
guests
had
been
invited
one
was
the
town
constable
and
the
other
was
a
free
colored
man
who
tried
to
pass
himself
off
for
white
and
who
was
always
ready
to
do
any
mean
work
for
the
sake
of
currying
favor
with
white
people
my
grandmother
had
a
motive
for
inviting
them
she
managed
to
take
them
all
over
the
house
all
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
were
thrown
open
for
them
to
pass
in
and
out
and
after
dinner
they
were
invited
up
stairs
to
look
at
a
fine
mocking
bird
my
uncle
had
just
brought
home
there
too
the
rooms
were
all
thrown
open
that
they
might
look
in
when
i
heard
them
talking
on
the
piazza
my
heart
almost
stood
still
i
knew
this
colored
man
had
spent
many
nights
hunting
for
me
every
body
knew
he
had
the
blood
of
a
slave
father
in
his
veins
but
for
the
sake
of
passing
himself
off
for
white
he
was
ready
to
kiss
the
slaveholders
feet
how
i
despised
him
as
for
the
constable
he
wore
no
false
colors
the
duties
of
his
office
were
despicable
but
he
was
superior
to
his
companion
inasmuch
as
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
what
he
was
not
any
white
man
who
could
raise
money
enough
to
buy
a
slave
would
have
considered
himself
degraded
by
being
a
constable
but
the
office
enabled
its
possessor
to
exercise
authority
if
he
found
any
slave
out
after
nine
he
could
whip
him
as
much
as
he
liked
and
that
was
a
privilege
to
be
coveted
when
the
guests
were
ready
to
depart
my
grandmother
gave
each
of
them
some
of
her
nice
pudding
as
a
present
for
their
wives
through
my
i
saw
them
go
out
of
the
gate
and
i
was
glad
when
it
closed
after
them
so
passed
the
first
christmas
in
my
den
xxiii
still
in
prison
when
spring
returned
and
i
took
in
the
little
patch
of
green
the
aperture
commanded
i
asked
myself
how
many
more
summers
and
winters
i
must
be
condemned
to
spend
thus
i
longed
to
draw
in
a
plentiful
draught
of
fresh
air
to
stretch
my
cramped
limbs
to
have
room
to
stand
erect
to
feel
the
earth
under
my
feet
again
my
relatives
were
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
of
escape
but
none
offered
that
seemed
practicable
and
even
tolerably
safe
the
hot
summer
came
again
and
made
the
turpentine
drop
from
the
thin
roof
over
my
head
during
the
long
nights
i
was
restless
for
want
of
air
and
i
had
no
room
to
toss
and
turn
there
was
but
one
compensation
the
atmosphere
was
so
stifled
that
even
mosquitos
would
not
condescend
to
buzz
in
it
with
all
my
detestation
of
flint
i
could
hardly
wish
him
a
worse
punishment
either
in
this
world
or
that
which
is
to
come
than
to
suffer
what
i
suffered
in
one
single
summer
yet
the
laws
allowed
to
be
out
in
the
free
air
while
i
guiltless
of
crime
was
pent
up
here
as
the
only
means
of
avoiding
the
cruelties
the
laws
allowed
him
to
inflict
upon
me
i
know
what
kept
life
within
me
again
and
again
i
thought
i
should
die
before
long
but
i
saw
the
leaves
of
another
autumn
whirl
through
the
air
and
felt
the
touch
of
another
winter
in
summer
the
most
terrible
thunder
storms
were
acceptable
for
the
rain
came
through
the
roof
and
i
rolled
up
my
bed
that
it
might
cool
the
hot
boards
under
it
later
in
the
season
storms
sometimes
wet
my
clothes
through
and
through
and
that
was
not
comfortable
when
the
air
grew
chilly
moderate
storms
i
could
keep
out
by
filling
the
chinks
with
oakum
but
uncomfortable
as
my
situation
was
i
had
glimpses
of
things
out
of
doors
which
made
me
thankful
for
my
wretched
one
day
i
saw
a
slave
pass
our
gate
muttering
it
his
own
and
he
can
kill
it
if
he
will
my
grandmother
told
me
that
woman
history
her
mistress
had
that
day
seen
her
baby
for
the
first
time
and
in
the
lineaments
of
its
fair
face
she
saw
a
likeness
to
her
husband
she
turned
the
bondwoman
and
her
child
out
of
doors
and
forbade
her
ever
to
return
the
slave
went
to
her
master
and
told
him
what
had
happened
he
promised
to
talk
with
her
mistress
and
make
it
all
right
the
next
day
she
and
her
baby
were
sold
to
a
georgia
trader
another
time
i
saw
a
woman
rush
wildly
by
pursued
by
two
men
she
was
a
slave
the
wet
nurse
of
her
mistress
children
for
some
trifling
offence
her
mistress
ordered
her
to
be
stripped
and
whipped
to
escape
the
degradation
and
the
torture
she
rushed
to
the
river
jumped
in
and
ended
her
wrongs
in
death
senator
brown
of
mississippi
could
not
be
ignorant
of
many
such
facts
as
these
for
they
are
of
frequent
occurrence
in
every
southern
state
yet
he
stood
up
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
declared
that
slavery
was
a
great
moral
social
and
political
blessing
a
blessing
to
the
master
and
a
blessing
to
the
slave
i
suffered
much
more
during
the
second
winter
than
i
did
during
the
first
my
limbs
were
benumbed
by
inaction
and
the
cold
filled
them
with
cramp
i
had
a
very
painful
sensation
of
coldness
in
my
head
even
my
face
and
tongue
stiffened
and
i
lost
the
power
of
speech
of
course
it
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
to
summon
any
physician
my
brother
william
came
and
did
all
he
could
for
me
uncle
phillip
also
watched
tenderly
over
me
and
poor
grandmother
crept
up
and
down
to
inquire
whether
there
were
any
signs
of
returning
life
i
was
restored
to
consciousness
by
the
dashing
of
cold
water
in
my
face
and
found
myself
leaning
against
my
brother
arm
while
he
bent
over
me
with
streaming
eyes
he
afterwards
told
me
he
thought
i
was
dying
for
i
had
been
in
an
unconscious
state
sixteen
hours
i
next
became
delirious
and
was
in
great
danger
of
betraying
myself
and
my
friends
to
prevent
this
they
stupefied
me
with
drugs
i
remained
in
bed
six
weeks
weary
in
body
and
sick
at
heart
how
to
get
medical
advice
was
the
question
william
finally
went
to
a
thompsonian
doctor
and
described
himself
as
having
all
my
pains
and
aches
he
returned
with
herbs
roots
and
ointment
he
was
especially
charged
to
rub
on
the
ointment
by
a
fire
but
how
could
a
fire
be
made
in
my
little
den
charcoal
in
a
furnace
was
tried
but
there
was
no
outlet
for
the
gas
and
it
nearly
cost
me
my
life
afterwards
coals
already
kindled
were
brought
up
in
an
iron
pan
and
placed
on
bricks
i
was
so
weak
and
it
was
so
long
since
i
had
enjoyed
the
warmth
of
a
fire
that
those
few
coals
actually
made
me
weep
i
think
the
medicines
did
me
some
good
but
my
recovery
was
very
slow
dark
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
lay
there
day
after
day
i
tried
to
be
thankful
for
my
little
cell
dismal
as
it
was
and
even
to
love
it
as
part
of
the
price
i
had
paid
for
the
redemption
of
my
children
sometimes
i
thought
god
was
a
compassionate
father
who
would
forgive
my
sins
for
the
sake
of
my
sufferings
at
other
times
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
no
justice
or
mercy
in
the
divine
government
i
asked
why
the
curse
of
slavery
was
permitted
to
exist
and
why
i
had
been
so
persecuted
and
wronged
from
youth
upward
these
things
took
the
shape
of
mystery
which
is
to
this
day
not
so
clear
to
my
soul
as
i
trust
it
will
be
hereafter
in
the
midst
of
my
illness
grandmother
broke
down
under
the
weight
and
anxiety
and
toil
the
idea
of
losing
her
who
had
always
been
my
best
friend
and
a
mother
to
my
children
was
the
sorest
trial
i
had
yet
had
o
how
earnestly
i
prayed
that
she
might
recover
how
hard
it
seemed
that
i
could
not
tend
upon
her
who
had
so
long
and
so
tenderly
watched
over
me
one
day
the
screams
of
a
child
nerved
me
with
strength
to
crawl
to
my
and
i
saw
my
son
covered
with
blood
a
fierce
dog
usually
kept
chained
had
seized
and
bitten
him
a
doctor
was
sent
for
and
i
heard
the
groans
and
screams
of
my
child
while
the
wounds
were
being
sewed
up
o
what
torture
to
a
mother
heart
to
listen
to
this
and
be
unable
to
go
to
him
but
childhood
is
like
a
day
in
spring
alternately
shower
and
sunshine
before
night
benny
was
bright
and
lively
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
dog
and
great
was
his
delight
when
the
doctor
told
him
the
next
day
that
the
dog
had
bitten
another
boy
and
been
shot
benny
recovered
from
his
wounds
but
it
was
long
before
he
could
walk
when
my
grandmother
illness
became
known
many
ladies
who
were
her
customers
called
to
bring
her
some
little
comforts
and
to
inquire
whether
she
had
every
thing
she
wanted
aunt
nancy
one
night
asked
permission
to
watch
with
her
sick
mother
and
flint
replied
i
do
see
any
need
of
your
going
i
ca
spare
you
but
when
she
found
other
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
were
so
attentive
not
wishing
to
be
outdone
in
christian
charity
she
also
sallied
forth
in
magnificent
condescension
and
stood
by
the
bedside
of
her
who
had
loved
her
in
her
infancy
and
who
had
been
repaid
by
such
grievous
wrongs
she
seemed
surprised
to
find
her
so
ill
and
scolded
uncle
phillip
for
not
sending
for
flint
she
herself
sent
for
him
immediately
and
he
came
secure
as
i
was
in
my
retreat
i
should
have
been
terrified
if
i
had
known
he
was
so
near
me
he
pronounced
my
grandmother
in
a
very
critical
situation
and
said
if
her
attending
physician
wished
it
he
would
visit
her
nobody
wished
to
have
him
coming
to
the
house
at
all
hours
and
we
were
not
disposed
to
give
him
a
chance
to
make
out
a
long
bill
as
flint
went
out
sally
told
her
the
reason
benny
was
lame
was
that
a
dog
had
bitten
him
i
glad
of
it
replied
she
i
wish
he
had
killed
him
it
would
be
good
news
to
send
to
his
mother
day
will
come
the
dogs
will
grab
yet
with
these
christian
words
she
and
her
husband
departed
and
to
my
great
satisfaction
returned
no
more
i
learned
from
uncle
phillip
with
feelings
of
unspeakable
joy
and
gratitude
that
the
crisis
was
passed
and
grandmother
would
live
i
could
now
say
from
my
heart
god
is
merciful
he
has
spared
me
the
anguish
of
feeling
that
i
caused
her
death
xxiv
the
candidate
for
congress
the
summer
had
nearly
ended
when
flint
made
a
third
visit
to
new
york
in
search
of
me
two
candidates
were
running
for
congress
and
he
returned
in
season
to
vote
the
father
of
my
children
was
the
whig
candidate
the
doctor
had
hitherto
been
a
stanch
whig
but
now
he
exerted
all
his
energies
for
the
defeat
of
sands
he
invited
large
parties
of
men
to
dine
in
the
shade
of
his
trees
and
supplied
them
with
plenty
of
rum
and
brandy
if
any
poor
fellow
drowned
his
wits
in
the
bowl
and
in
the
openness
of
his
convivial
heart
proclaimed
that
he
did
not
mean
to
vote
the
democratic
ticket
he
was
shoved
into
the
street
without
ceremony
the
doctor
expended
his
liquor
in
vain
sands
was
elected
an
event
which
occasioned
me
some
anxious
thoughts
he
had
not
emancipated
my
children
and
if
he
should
die
they
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
his
heirs
two
little
voices
that
frequently
met
my
ear
seemed
to
plead
with
me
not
to
let
their
father
depart
without
striving
to
make
their
freedom
secure
years
had
passed
since
i
had
spoken
to
him
i
had
not
even
seen
him
since
the
night
i
passed
him
unrecognized
in
my
disguise
of
a
sailor
i
supposed
he
would
call
before
he
left
to
say
something
to
my
grandmother
concerning
the
children
and
i
resolved
what
course
to
take
the
day
before
his
departure
for
washington
i
made
arrangements
toward
evening
to
get
from
my
into
the
storeroom
below
i
found
myself
so
stiff
and
clumsy
that
it
was
with
great
difficulty
i
could
hitch
from
one
resting
place
to
another
when
i
reached
the
storeroom
my
ankles
gave
way
under
me
and
i
sank
exhausted
on
the
floor
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
never
use
my
limbs
again
but
the
purpose
i
had
in
view
roused
all
the
strength
i
had
i
crawled
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
the
window
and
screened
behind
a
barrel
i
waited
for
his
coming
the
clock
struck
nine
and
i
knew
the
steamboat
would
leave
between
ten
and
eleven
my
hopes
were
failing
but
presently
i
heard
his
voice
saying
to
some
one
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
wish
to
see
aunt
martha
when
he
came
out
as
he
passed
the
window
i
said
stop
one
moment
and
let
me
speak
for
my
children
he
started
hesitated
and
then
passed
on
and
went
out
of
the
gate
i
closed
the
shutter
i
had
partially
opened
and
sank
down
behind
the
barrel
i
had
suffered
much
but
seldom
had
i
experienced
a
keener
pang
than
i
then
felt
had
my
children
then
become
of
so
little
consequence
to
him
and
had
he
so
little
feeling
for
their
wretched
mother
that
he
would
not
listen
a
moment
while
she
pleaded
for
them
painful
memories
were
so
busy
within
me
that
i
forgot
i
had
not
hooked
the
shutter
till
i
heard
some
one
opening
it
i
looked
up
he
had
come
back
who
called
me
said
he
in
a
low
tone
i
did
i
replied
oh
linda
said
he
i
knew
your
voice
but
i
was
afraid
to
answer
lest
my
friend
should
hear
me
why
do
you
come
here
is
it
possible
you
risk
yourself
in
this
house
they
are
mad
to
allow
it
i
shall
expect
to
hear
that
you
are
all
ruined
i
did
not
wish
to
implicate
him
by
letting
him
know
my
place
of
concealment
so
i
merely
said
i
thought
you
would
come
to
bid
grandmother
good
by
and
so
i
came
here
to
speak
a
few
words
to
you
about
emancipating
my
children
many
changes
may
take
place
during
the
six
months
you
are
gone
to
washington
and
it
does
not
seem
right
for
you
to
expose
them
to
the
risk
of
such
changes
i
want
nothing
for
myself
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
free
my
children
or
authorize
some
friend
to
do
it
before
you
go
he
promised
he
would
do
it
and
also
expressed
a
readiness
to
make
any
arrangements
whereby
i
could
be
purchased
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
closed
the
shutter
hastily
i
wanted
to
crawl
back
to
my
den
without
letting
the
family
know
what
i
had
done
for
i
knew
they
would
deem
it
very
imprudent
but
he
stepped
back
into
the
house
to
tell
my
grandmother
that
he
had
spoken
with
me
at
the
storeroom
window
and
to
beg
of
her
not
to
allow
me
to
remain
in
the
house
over
night
he
said
it
was
the
height
of
madness
for
me
to
be
there
that
we
should
certainly
all
be
ruined
luckily
he
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
wait
for
a
reply
or
the
dear
old
woman
would
surely
have
told
him
all
i
tried
to
go
back
to
my
den
but
found
it
more
difficult
to
go
up
than
i
had
to
come
down
now
that
my
mission
was
fulfilled
the
little
strength
that
had
supported
me
through
it
was
gone
and
i
sank
helpless
on
the
floor
my
grandmother
alarmed
at
the
risk
i
had
run
came
into
the
storeroom
in
the
dark
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
linda
she
whispered
where
are
you
i
am
here
by
the
window
i
replied
i
have
him
go
away
without
emancipating
the
children
who
knows
what
may
happen
come
come
child
said
she
it
wo
do
for
you
to
stay
here
another
minute
you
done
wrong
but
i
ca
blame
you
poor
thing
i
told
her
i
could
not
return
without
assistance
and
she
must
call
my
uncle
uncle
phillip
came
and
pity
prevented
him
from
scolding
me
he
carried
me
back
to
my
dungeon
laid
me
tenderly
on
the
bed
gave
me
some
medicine
and
asked
me
if
there
was
any
thing
more
he
could
do
then
he
went
away
and
i
was
left
with
my
own
thoughts
starless
as
the
midnight
darkness
around
me
my
friends
feared
i
should
become
a
cripple
for
life
and
i
was
so
weary
of
my
long
imprisonment
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
hope
of
serving
my
children
i
should
have
been
thankful
to
die
but
for
their
sakes
i
was
willing
to
bear
on
xxv
competition
in
cunning
flint
had
not
given
me
up
every
now
and
then
he
would
say
to
my
grandmother
that
i
would
yet
come
back
and
voluntarily
surrender
myself
and
that
when
i
did
i
could
be
purchased
by
my
relatives
or
any
one
who
wished
to
buy
me
i
knew
his
cunning
nature
too
well
not
to
perceive
that
this
was
a
trap
laid
for
me
and
so
all
my
friends
understood
it
i
resolved
to
match
my
cunning
against
his
cunning
in
order
to
make
him
believe
that
i
was
in
new
york
i
resolved
to
write
him
a
letter
dated
from
that
place
i
sent
for
my
friend
peter
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
any
trustworthy
seafaring
person
who
would
carry
such
a
letter
to
new
york
and
put
it
in
the
post
office
there
he
said
he
knew
one
that
he
would
trust
with
his
own
life
to
the
ends
of
the
world
i
reminded
him
that
it
was
a
hazardous
thing
for
him
to
undertake
he
said
he
knew
it
but
he
was
willing
to
do
any
thing
to
help
me
i
expressed
a
wish
for
a
new
york
paper
to
ascertain
the
names
of
some
of
the
streets
he
run
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
said
here
is
half
a
one
that
was
round
a
cap
i
bought
of
a
pedler
yesterday
i
told
him
the
letter
would
be
ready
the
next
evening
he
bade
me
good
by
adding
keep
up
your
spirits
linda
brighter
days
will
come
by
and
by
my
uncle
phillip
kept
watch
over
the
gate
until
our
brief
interview
was
over
early
the
next
morning
i
seated
myself
near
the
little
aperture
to
examine
the
newspaper
it
was
a
piece
of
the
new
york
herald
and
for
once
the
paper
that
systematically
abuses
the
colored
people
was
made
to
render
them
a
service
having
obtained
what
information
i
wanted
concerning
streets
and
numbers
i
wrote
two
letters
one
to
my
grandmother
the
other
to
flint
i
reminded
him
how
he
a
man
had
treated
a
helpless
child
who
had
been
placed
in
his
power
and
what
years
of
misery
he
had
brought
upon
her
to
my
grandmother
i
expressed
a
wish
to
have
my
children
sent
to
me
at
the
north
where
i
could
teach
them
to
respect
themselves
and
set
them
a
virtuous
example
which
a
slave
mother
was
not
allowed
to
do
at
the
south
i
asked
her
to
direct
her
answer
to
a
certain
street
in
boston
as
i
did
not
live
in
new
york
though
i
went
there
sometimes
i
dated
these
letters
ahead
to
allow
for
the
time
it
would
take
to
carry
them
and
sent
a
memorandum
of
the
date
to
the
messenger
when
my
friend
came
for
the
letters
i
said
god
bless
and
reward
you
peter
for
this
disinterested
kindness
pray
be
careful
if
you
are
detected
both
you
and
i
will
have
to
suffer
dreadfully
i
have
not
a
relative
who
would
dare
to
do
it
for
me
he
replied
you
may
trust
to
me
linda
i
do
forget
that
your
father
was
my
best
friend
and
i
will
be
a
friend
to
his
children
so
long
as
god
lets
me
live
it
was
necessary
to
tell
my
grandmother
what
i
had
done
in
order
that
she
might
be
ready
for
the
letter
and
prepared
to
hear
what
flint
might
say
about
my
being
at
the
north
she
was
sadly
troubled
she
felt
sure
mischief
would
come
of
it
i
also
told
my
plan
to
aunt
nancy
in
order
that
she
might
report
to
us
what
was
said
at
flint
house
i
whispered
it
to
her
through
a
crack
and
she
whispered
back
i
hope
it
will
succeed
i
sha
mind
being
a
slave
all
life
if
i
can
only
see
you
and
the
children
free
i
had
directed
that
my
letters
should
be
put
into
the
new
york
post
office
on
the
of
the
month
on
the
evening
of
the
my
aunt
came
to
say
that
flint
and
his
wife
had
been
talking
in
a
low
voice
about
a
letter
he
had
received
and
that
when
he
went
to
his
office
he
promised
to
bring
it
when
he
came
to
tea
so
i
concluded
i
should
hear
my
letter
read
the
next
morning
i
told
my
grandmother
flint
would
be
sure
to
come
and
asked
her
to
have
him
sit
near
a
certain
door
and
leave
it
open
that
i
might
hear
what
he
said
the
next
morning
i
took
my
station
within
sound
of
that
door
and
remained
motionless
as
a
statue
it
was
not
long
before
i
heard
the
gate
slam
and
the
footsteps
enter
the
house
he
seated
himself
in
the
chair
that
was
placed
for
him
and
said
well
martha
i
brought
you
a
letter
from
linda
she
has
sent
me
a
letter
also
i
know
exactly
where
to
find
her
but
i
do
choose
to
go
to
boston
for
her
i
had
rather
she
would
come
back
of
her
own
accord
in
a
respectable
manner
her
uncle
phillip
is
the
best
person
to
go
for
her
with
she
would
feel
perfectly
free
to
act
i
am
willing
to
pay
his
expenses
going
and
returning
she
shall
be
sold
to
her
friends
her
children
are
free
at
least
i
suppose
they
are
and
when
you
obtain
her
freedom
you
make
a
happy
family
i
suppose
martha
you
have
no
objection
to
my
reading
to
you
the
letter
linda
has
written
to
you
he
broke
the
seal
and
i
heard
him
read
it
the
old
villain
he
had
suppressed
the
letter
i
wrote
to
grandmother
and
prepared
a
substitute
of
his
own
the
purport
of
which
was
as
follows
dear
grandmother
i
have
long
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
the
disgraceful
manner
in
which
i
left
you
and
my
children
made
me
ashamed
to
do
it
if
you
knew
how
much
i
have
suffered
since
i
ran
away
you
would
pity
and
forgive
me
i
have
purchased
freedom
at
a
dear
rate
if
any
arrangement
could
be
made
for
me
to
return
to
the
south
without
being
a
slave
i
would
gladly
come
if
not
i
beg
of
you
to
send
my
children
to
the
north
i
can
not
live
any
longer
without
them
let
me
know
in
time
and
i
will
meet
them
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
whichever
place
best
suits
my
convenience
write
as
soon
as
possible
to
your
unhappy
daughter
linda
it
is
very
much
as
i
expected
it
would
be
said
the
old
hypocrite
rising
to
go
you
see
the
foolish
girl
has
repented
of
her
rashness
and
wants
to
return
we
must
help
her
to
do
it
martha
talk
with
phillip
about
it
if
he
will
go
for
her
she
will
trust
to
him
and
come
back
i
should
like
an
answer
good
morning
martha
as
he
stepped
out
on
the
piazza
he
stumbled
over
my
little
girl
ah
ellen
is
that
you
he
said
in
his
most
gracious
manner
i
did
see
you
how
do
you
do
pretty
well
sir
she
replied
i
heard
you
tell
grandmother
that
my
mother
is
coming
home
i
want
to
see
her
yes
ellen
i
am
going
to
bring
her
home
very
soon
rejoined
he
and
you
shall
see
her
as
much
as
you
like
you
little
nigger
this
was
as
good
as
a
comedy
to
me
who
had
heard
it
all
but
grandmother
was
frightened
and
distressed
because
the
doctor
wanted
my
uncle
to
go
for
me
the
next
evening
flint
called
to
talk
the
matter
over
my
uncle
told
him
that
from
what
he
had
heard
of
massachusetts
he
judged
he
should
be
mobbed
if
he
went
there
after
a
runaway
slave
all
stuff
and
nonsense
phillip
replied
the
doctor
do
you
suppose
i
want
you
to
kick
up
a
row
in
boston
the
business
can
all
be
done
quietly
linda
writes
that
she
wants
to
come
back
you
are
her
relative
and
she
would
trust
the
case
would
be
different
if
i
went
she
might
object
to
coming
with
and
the
damned
abolitionists
if
they
knew
i
was
her
master
would
not
believe
me
if
i
told
them
she
had
begged
to
go
back
they
would
get
up
a
row
and
i
should
not
like
to
see
linda
dragged
through
the
streets
like
a
common
negro
she
has
been
very
ungrateful
to
me
for
all
my
kindness
but
i
forgive
her
and
want
to
act
the
part
of
a
friend
towards
her
i
have
no
wish
to
hold
her
as
my
slave
her
friends
can
buy
her
as
soon
as
she
arrives
here
finding
that
his
arguments
failed
to
convince
my
uncle
the
doctor
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
by
saying
that
he
had
written
to
the
mayor
of
boston
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
a
person
of
my
description
at
the
street
and
number
from
which
my
letter
was
dated
he
had
omitted
this
date
in
the
letter
he
had
made
up
to
read
to
my
grandmother
if
i
had
dated
from
new
york
the
old
man
would
probably
have
made
another
journey
to
that
city
but
even
in
that
dark
region
where
knowledge
is
so
carefully
excluded
from
the
slave
i
had
heard
enough
about
massachusetts
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
slaveholders
did
not
consider
it
a
comfortable
place
to
go
in
search
of
a
runaway
that
was
before
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
passed
before
massachusetts
had
consented
to
become
a
nigger
hunter
for
the
south
my
grandmother
who
had
become
skittish
by
seeing
her
family
always
in
danger
came
to
me
with
a
very
distressed
countenance
and
said
what
will
you
do
if
the
mayor
of
boston
sends
him
word
that
you
have
been
there
then
he
will
suspect
the
letter
was
a
trick
and
maybe
he
find
out
something
about
it
and
we
shall
all
get
into
trouble
o
linda
i
wish
you
had
never
sent
the
letters
do
worry
yourself
grandmother
said
i
the
mayor
of
boston
trouble
himself
to
hunt
niggers
for
flint
the
letters
will
do
good
in
the
end
i
shall
get
out
of
this
dark
hole
some
time
or
other
i
hope
you
will
child
replied
the
good
patient
old
friend
you
have
been
here
a
long
time
almost
five
years
but
whenever
you
do
go
it
will
break
your
old
grandmother
heart
i
should
be
expecting
every
day
to
hear
that
you
were
brought
back
in
irons
and
put
in
jail
god
help
you
poor
child
let
us
be
thankful
that
some
time
or
other
we
shall
go
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
my
heart
responded
amen
the
fact
that
flint
had
written
to
the
mayor
of
boston
convinced
me
that
he
believed
my
letter
to
be
genuine
and
of
course
that
he
had
no
suspicion
of
my
being
any
where
in
the
vicinity
it
was
a
great
object
to
keep
up
this
delusion
for
it
made
me
and
my
friends
feel
less
anxious
and
it
would
be
very
convenient
whenever
there
was
a
chance
to
escape
i
resolved
therefore
to
continue
to
write
letters
from
the
north
from
time
to
time
two
or
three
weeks
passed
and
as
no
news
came
from
the
mayor
of
boston
grandmother
began
to
listen
to
my
entreaty
to
be
allowed
to
leave
my
cell
sometimes
and
exercise
my
limbs
to
prevent
my
becoming
a
cripple
i
was
allowed
to
slip
down
into
the
small
storeroom
early
in
the
morning
and
remain
there
a
little
while
the
room
was
all
filled
up
with
barrels
except
a
small
open
space
under
my
this
faced
the
door
the
upper
part
of
which
was
of
glass
and
purposely
left
uncurtained
that
the
curious
might
look
in
the
air
of
this
place
was
close
but
it
was
so
much
better
than
the
atmosphere
of
my
cell
that
i
dreaded
to
return
i
came
down
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
remained
till
eight
when
people
began
to
be
about
and
there
was
danger
that
some
one
might
come
on
the
piazza
i
had
tried
various
applications
to
bring
warmth
and
feeling
into
my
limbs
but
without
avail
they
were
so
numb
and
stiff
that
it
was
a
painful
effort
to
move
and
had
my
enemies
come
upon
me
during
the
first
mornings
i
tried
to
exercise
them
a
little
in
the
small
unoccupied
space
of
the
storeroom
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
have
escaped
xxvi
important
era
in
my
brother
life
i
missed
the
company
and
kind
attentions
of
my
brother
william
who
had
gone
to
washington
with
his
master
sands
we
received
several
letters
from
him
written
without
any
allusion
to
me
but
expressed
in
such
a
manner
that
i
knew
he
did
not
forget
me
i
disguised
my
hand
and
wrote
to
him
in
the
same
manner
it
was
a
long
session
and
when
it
closed
william
wrote
to
inform
us
that
sands
was
going
to
the
north
to
be
gone
some
time
and
that
he
was
to
accompany
him
i
knew
that
his
master
had
promised
to
give
him
his
freedom
but
no
time
had
been
specified
would
william
trust
to
a
slave
chances
i
remembered
how
we
used
to
talk
together
in
our
young
days
about
obtaining
our
freedom
and
i
thought
it
very
doubtful
whether
he
would
come
back
to
us
grandmother
received
a
letter
from
sands
saying
that
william
had
proved
a
most
faithful
servant
and
he
would
also
say
a
valued
friend
that
no
mother
had
ever
trained
a
better
boy
he
said
he
had
travelled
through
the
northern
states
and
canada
and
though
the
abolitionists
had
tried
to
decoy
him
away
they
had
never
succeeded
he
ended
by
saying
they
should
be
at
home
shortly
we
expected
letters
from
william
describing
the
novelties
of
his
journey
but
none
came
in
time
it
was
reported
that
sands
would
return
late
in
the
autumn
accompanied
by
a
bride
still
no
letters
from
william
i
felt
almost
sure
i
should
never
see
him
again
on
southern
soil
but
had
he
no
word
of
comfort
to
send
to
his
friends
at
home
to
the
poor
captive
in
her
dungeon
my
thoughts
wandered
through
the
dark
past
and
over
the
uncertain
future
alone
in
my
cell
where
no
eye
but
god
could
see
me
i
wept
bitter
tears
how
earnestly
i
prayed
to
him
to
restore
me
to
my
children
and
enable
me
to
be
a
useful
woman
and
a
good
mother
at
last
the
day
arrived
for
the
return
of
the
travellers
grandmother
had
made
loving
preparations
to
welcome
her
absent
boy
back
to
the
old
hearthstone
when
the
dinner
table
was
laid
william
place
occupied
its
old
place
the
stage
coach
went
by
empty
my
grandmother
waited
dinner
she
thought
perhaps
he
was
necessarily
detained
by
his
master
in
my
prison
i
listened
anxiously
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
my
dear
brother
voice
and
step
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
a
lad
was
sent
by
sands
to
tell
grandmother
that
william
did
not
return
with
him
that
the
abolitionists
had
decoyed
him
away
but
he
begged
her
not
to
feel
troubled
about
it
for
he
felt
confident
she
would
see
william
in
a
few
days
as
soon
as
he
had
time
to
reflect
he
would
come
back
for
he
could
never
expect
to
be
so
well
off
at
the
north
as
he
had
been
with
him
if
you
had
seen
the
tears
and
heard
the
sobs
you
would
have
thought
the
messenger
had
brought
tidings
of
death
instead
of
freedom
poor
old
grandmother
felt
that
she
should
never
see
her
darling
boy
again
and
i
was
selfish
i
thought
more
of
what
i
had
lost
than
of
what
my
brother
had
gained
a
new
anxiety
began
to
trouble
me
sands
had
expended
a
good
deal
of
money
and
would
naturally
feel
irritated
by
the
loss
he
had
incurred
i
greatly
feared
this
might
injure
the
prospects
of
my
children
who
were
now
becoming
valuable
property
i
longed
to
have
their
emancipation
made
certain
the
more
so
because
their
master
and
father
was
now
married
i
was
too
familiar
with
slavery
not
to
know
that
promises
made
to
slaves
though
with
kind
intentions
and
sincere
at
the
time
depend
upon
many
contingencies
for
their
fulfillment
much
as
i
wished
william
to
be
free
the
step
he
had
taken
made
me
sad
and
anxious
the
following
sabbath
was
calm
and
clear
so
beautiful
that
it
seemed
like
a
sabbath
in
the
eternal
world
my
grandmother
brought
the
children
out
on
the
piazza
that
i
might
hear
their
voices
she
thought
it
would
comfort
me
in
my
despondency
and
it
did
they
chatted
merrily
as
only
children
can
benny
said
grandmother
do
you
think
uncle
will
has
gone
for
good
wo
he
ever
come
back
again
may
be
he
find
mother
if
he
does
she
be
glad
to
see
him
why
do
you
and
uncle
phillip
and
all
of
us
go
and
live
where
mother
is
i
should
like
it
would
you
ellen
yes
i
should
like
it
replied
ellen
but
how
could
we
find
her
do
you
know
the
place
grandmother
i
do
remember
how
mother
looked
do
you
benny
benny
was
just
beginning
to
describe
me
when
they
were
interrupted
by
an
old
slave
woman
a
near
neighbor
named
aggie
this
poor
creature
had
witnessed
the
sale
of
her
children
and
seen
them
carried
off
to
parts
unknown
without
any
hopes
of
ever
hearing
from
them
again
she
saw
that
my
grandmother
had
been
weeping
and
she
said
in
a
sympathizing
tone
the
matter
aunt
marthy
o
aggie
she
replied
it
seems
as
if
i
should
have
any
of
my
children
or
grandchildren
left
to
hand
me
a
drink
when
i
dying
and
lay
my
old
body
in
the
ground
my
boy
did
come
back
with
sands
he
staid
at
the
north
poor
old
aggie
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
is
what
you
crying
fur
she
exclaimed
git
down
on
your
knees
and
bress
de
lord
i
do
know
whar
my
poor
chillern
is
and
i
nebber
to
know
you
do
know
whar
poor
linda
gone
to
but
you
know
whar
her
brudder
is
he
in
free
parts
and
dat
de
right
place
do
murmur
at
de
lord
doings
but
git
down
on
your
knees
and
tank
him
for
his
goodness
my
selfishness
was
rebuked
by
what
poor
aggie
said
she
rejoiced
over
the
escape
of
one
who
was
merely
her
while
his
own
sister
was
only
thinking
what
his
good
fortune
might
cost
her
children
i
knelt
and
prayed
god
to
forgive
me
and
i
thanked
him
from
my
heart
that
one
of
my
family
was
saved
from
the
grasp
of
slavery
it
was
not
long
before
we
received
a
letter
from
william
he
wrote
that
sands
had
always
treated
him
kindly
and
that
he
had
tried
to
do
his
duty
to
him
faithfully
but
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
he
had
longed
to
be
free
and
he
had
already
gone
through
enough
to
convince
him
he
had
better
not
lose
the
chance
that
offered
he
concluded
by
saying
do
worry
about
me
dear
grandmother
i
shall
think
of
you
always
and
it
will
spur
me
on
to
work
hard
and
try
to
do
right
when
i
have
earned
money
enough
to
give
you
a
home
perhaps
you
will
come
to
the
north
and
we
can
all
live
happy
together
sands
told
my
uncle
phillip
the
particulars
about
william
leaving
him
he
said
i
trusted
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
brother
and
treated
him
as
kindly
the
abolitionists
talked
to
him
in
several
places
but
i
had
no
idea
they
could
tempt
him
however
i
do
blame
william
he
young
and
inconsiderate
and
those
northern
rascals
decoyed
him
i
must
confess
the
scamp
was
very
bold
about
it
i
met
him
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
astor
house
with
his
trunk
on
his
shoulder
and
i
asked
him
where
he
was
going
he
said
he
was
going
to
change
his
old
trunk
i
told
him
it
was
rather
shabby
and
asked
if
he
did
need
some
money
he
said
no
thanked
me
and
went
off
he
did
not
return
so
soon
as
i
expected
but
i
waited
patiently
at
last
i
went
to
see
if
our
trunks
were
packed
ready
for
our
journey
i
found
them
locked
and
a
sealed
note
on
the
table
informed
me
where
i
could
find
the
keys
the
fellow
even
tried
to
be
religious
he
wrote
that
he
hoped
god
would
always
bless
me
and
reward
me
for
my
kindness
that
he
was
not
unwilling
to
serve
me
but
he
wanted
to
be
a
free
man
and
that
if
i
thought
he
did
wrong
he
hoped
i
would
forgive
him
i
intended
to
give
him
his
freedom
in
five
years
he
might
have
trusted
me
he
has
shown
himself
ungrateful
but
i
shall
not
go
for
him
or
send
for
him
i
feel
confident
that
he
will
soon
return
to
me
i
afterwards
heard
an
account
of
the
affair
from
william
himself
he
had
not
been
urged
away
by
abolitionists
he
needed
no
information
they
could
give
him
about
slavery
to
stimulate
his
desire
for
freedom
he
looked
at
his
hands
and
remembered
that
they
were
once
in
irons
what
security
had
he
that
they
would
not
be
so
again
sands
was
kind
to
him
but
he
might
indefinitely
postpone
the
promise
he
had
made
to
give
him
his
freedom
he
might
come
under
pecuniary
embarrassments
and
his
property
be
seized
by
creditors
or
he
might
die
without
making
any
arrangements
in
his
favor
he
had
too
often
known
such
accidents
to
happen
to
slaves
who
had
kind
masters
and
he
wisely
resolved
to
make
sure
of
the
present
opportunity
to
own
himself
he
was
scrupulous
about
taking
any
money
from
his
master
on
false
pretences
so
he
sold
his
best
clothes
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
boston
the
slaveholders
pronounced
him
a
base
ungrateful
wretch
for
thus
requiting
his
master
indulgence
what
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
when
flint
family
heard
that
william
had
deserted
sands
they
chuckled
greatly
over
the
news
flint
made
her
usual
manifestations
of
christian
feeling
by
saying
i
glad
of
it
i
hope
he
never
get
him
again
i
like
to
see
people
paid
back
in
their
own
coin
i
reckon
children
will
have
to
pay
for
it
i
should
be
glad
to
see
them
in
the
speculator
hands
again
for
i
tired
of
seeing
those
little
niggers
march
about
the
streets
xxvii
new
destination
for
the
children
flint
proclaimed
her
intention
of
informing
sands
who
was
the
father
of
my
children
she
likewise
proposed
to
tell
her
what
an
artful
devil
i
was
that
i
had
made
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
her
family
that
when
sands
was
at
the
north
she
did
doubt
i
had
followed
him
in
disguise
and
persuaded
william
to
run
away
she
had
some
reason
to
entertain
such
an
idea
for
i
had
written
from
the
north
from
time
to
time
and
i
dated
my
letters
from
various
places
many
of
them
fell
into
flint
hands
as
i
expected
they
would
and
he
must
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
travelled
about
a
good
deal
he
kept
a
close
watch
over
my
children
thinking
they
would
eventually
lead
to
my
detection
a
new
and
unexpected
trial
was
in
store
for
me
one
day
when
sands
and
his
wife
were
walking
in
the
street
they
met
benny
the
lady
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
exclaimed
what
a
pretty
little
negro
whom
does
he
belong
to
benny
did
not
hear
the
answer
but
he
came
home
very
indignant
with
the
stranger
lady
because
she
had
called
him
a
negro
a
few
days
afterwards
sands
called
on
my
grandmother
and
told
her
he
wanted
her
to
take
the
children
to
his
house
he
said
he
had
informed
his
wife
of
his
relation
to
them
and
told
her
they
were
motherless
and
she
wanted
to
see
them
when
he
had
gone
my
grandmother
came
and
asked
what
i
would
do
the
question
seemed
a
mockery
what
i
do
they
were
sands
slaves
and
their
mother
was
a
slave
whom
he
had
represented
to
be
dead
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
i
was
too
much
pained
and
puzzled
to
come
to
any
decision
and
the
children
were
carried
without
my
knowledge
sands
had
a
sister
from
illinois
staying
with
her
this
lady
who
had
no
children
of
her
own
was
so
much
pleased
with
ellen
that
she
offered
to
adopt
her
and
bring
her
up
as
she
would
a
daughter
sands
wanted
to
take
benjamin
when
grandmother
reported
this
to
me
i
was
tried
almost
beyond
endurance
was
this
all
i
was
to
gain
by
what
i
had
suffered
for
the
sake
of
having
my
children
free
true
the
prospect
fair
but
i
knew
too
well
how
lightly
slaveholders
held
such
parental
relations
if
pecuniary
troubles
should
come
or
if
the
new
wife
required
more
money
than
could
conveniently
be
spared
my
children
might
be
thought
of
as
a
convenient
means
of
raising
funds
i
had
no
trust
in
thee
o
slavery
never
should
i
know
peace
till
my
children
were
emancipated
with
all
due
formalities
of
law
i
was
too
proud
to
ask
sands
to
do
any
thing
for
my
own
benefit
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
become
a
supplicant
for
my
children
i
resolved
to
remind
him
of
the
promise
he
had
made
me
and
to
throw
myself
upon
his
honor
for
the
performance
of
it
i
persuaded
my
grandmother
to
go
to
him
and
tell
him
i
was
not
dead
and
that
i
earnestly
entreated
him
to
keep
the
promise
he
had
made
me
that
i
had
heard
of
the
recent
proposals
concerning
my
children
and
did
not
feel
easy
to
accept
them
that
he
had
promised
to
emancipate
them
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
redeem
his
pledge
i
knew
there
was
some
risk
in
thus
betraying
that
i
was
in
the
vicinity
but
what
will
not
a
mother
do
for
her
children
he
received
the
message
with
surprise
and
said
the
children
are
free
i
have
never
intended
to
claim
them
as
slaves
linda
may
decide
their
fate
in
my
opinion
they
had
better
be
sent
to
the
north
i
do
think
they
are
quite
safe
here
flint
boasts
that
they
are
still
in
his
power
he
says
they
were
his
daughter
property
and
as
she
was
not
of
age
when
they
were
sold
the
contract
is
not
legally
binding
so
then
after
all
i
had
endured
for
their
sakes
my
poor
children
were
between
two
fires
between
my
old
master
and
their
new
master
and
i
was
powerless
there
was
no
protecting
arm
of
the
law
for
me
to
invoke
sands
proposed
that
ellen
should
go
for
the
present
to
some
of
his
relatives
who
had
removed
to
brooklyn
long
island
it
was
promised
that
she
should
be
well
taken
care
of
and
sent
to
school
i
consented
to
it
as
the
best
arrangement
i
could
make
for
her
my
grandmother
of
course
negotiated
it
all
and
sands
knew
of
no
other
person
in
the
transaction
she
proposed
that
they
should
take
ellen
with
them
to
washington
and
keep
her
till
they
had
a
good
chance
of
sending
her
with
friends
to
brooklyn
she
had
an
infant
daughter
i
had
had
a
glimpse
of
it
as
the
nurse
passed
with
it
in
her
arms
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
to
me
that
the
bondwoman
child
should
tend
her
sister
but
there
was
no
alternative
ellen
was
made
ready
for
the
journey
o
how
it
tried
my
heart
to
send
her
away
so
young
alone
among
strangers
without
a
mother
love
to
shelter
her
from
the
storms
of
life
almost
without
memory
of
a
mother
i
doubted
whether
she
and
benny
would
have
for
me
the
natural
affection
that
children
feel
for
a
parent
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
might
perhaps
never
see
my
daughter
again
and
i
had
a
great
desire
that
she
should
look
upon
me
before
she
went
that
she
might
take
my
image
with
her
in
her
memory
it
seemed
to
me
cruel
to
have
her
brought
to
my
dungeon
it
was
sorrow
enough
for
her
young
heart
to
know
that
her
mother
was
a
victim
of
slavery
without
seeing
the
wretched
to
which
it
had
driven
her
i
begged
permission
to
pass
the
last
night
in
one
of
the
open
chambers
with
my
little
girl
they
thought
i
was
crazy
to
think
of
trusting
such
a
young
child
with
my
perilous
secret
i
told
them
i
had
watched
her
character
and
i
felt
sure
she
would
not
betray
me
that
i
was
determined
to
have
an
interview
and
if
they
would
not
facilitate
it
i
would
take
my
own
way
to
obtain
it
they
remonstrated
against
the
rashness
of
such
a
proceeding
but
finding
they
could
not
change
my
purpose
they
yielded
i
slipped
through
the
into
the
storeroom
and
my
uncle
kept
watch
at
the
gate
while
i
passed
into
the
piazza
and
went
up
stairs
to
the
room
i
used
to
occupy
it
was
more
than
five
years
since
i
had
seen
it
and
how
the
memories
crowded
on
me
there
i
had
taken
shelter
when
my
mistress
drove
me
from
her
house
there
came
my
old
tyrant
to
mock
insult
and
curse
me
there
my
children
were
first
laid
in
my
arms
there
i
had
watched
over
them
each
day
with
a
deeper
and
sadder
love
there
i
had
knelt
to
god
in
anguish
of
heart
to
forgive
the
wrong
i
had
done
how
vividly
it
all
came
back
and
after
this
long
gloomy
interval
i
stood
there
such
a
wreck
in
the
midst
of
these
meditations
i
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
the
door
opened
and
my
uncle
phillip
came
in
leading
ellen
by
the
hand
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
said
ellen
my
dear
child
i
am
your
mother
she
drew
back
a
little
and
looked
at
me
then
with
sweet
confidence
she
laid
her
cheek
against
mine
and
i
folded
her
to
the
heart
that
had
been
so
long
desolated
she
was
the
first
to
speak
raising
her
head
she
said
inquiringly
you
really
my
mother
i
told
her
i
really
was
that
during
all
the
long
time
she
had
not
seen
me
i
had
loved
her
most
tenderly
and
that
now
she
was
going
away
i
wanted
to
see
her
and
talk
with
her
that
she
might
remember
me
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
she
said
i
glad
you
come
to
see
me
but
why
did
you
ever
come
before
benny
and
i
have
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
he
remembers
you
and
sometimes
he
tells
me
about
you
why
did
you
come
home
when
flint
went
to
bring
you
i
answered
i
could
come
before
dear
but
now
that
i
am
with
you
tell
me
whether
you
like
to
go
away
i
do
know
said
she
crying
grandmother
says
i
ought
not
to
cry
that
i
am
going
to
a
good
place
where
i
can
learn
to
read
and
write
and
that
by
and
by
i
can
write
her
a
letter
but
i
sha
have
benny
or
grandmother
or
uncle
phillip
or
any
body
to
love
me
ca
you
go
with
me
o
go
dear
mother
i
told
her
i
could
go
now
but
sometime
i
would
come
to
her
and
then
she
and
benny
and
i
would
live
together
and
have
happy
times
she
wanted
to
run
and
bring
benny
to
see
me
now
i
told
her
he
was
going
to
the
north
before
long
with
uncle
phillip
and
then
i
would
come
to
see
him
before
he
went
away
i
asked
if
she
would
like
to
have
me
stay
all
night
and
sleep
with
her
o
yes
she
replied
then
turning
to
her
uncle
she
said
pleadingly
i
stay
please
uncle
she
is
my
own
mother
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
said
solemnly
ellen
this
is
the
secret
you
have
promised
grandmother
never
to
tell
if
you
ever
speak
of
it
to
any
body
they
will
never
let
you
see
your
grandmother
again
and
your
mother
can
never
come
to
brooklyn
uncle
she
replied
i
will
never
tell
he
told
her
she
might
stay
with
me
and
when
he
had
gone
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
told
her
i
was
a
slave
and
that
was
the
reason
she
must
never
say
she
had
seen
me
i
exhorted
her
to
be
a
good
child
to
try
to
please
the
people
where
she
was
going
and
that
god
would
raise
her
up
friends
i
told
her
to
say
her
prayers
and
remember
always
to
pray
for
her
poor
mother
and
that
god
would
permit
us
to
meet
again
she
wept
and
i
did
not
check
her
tears
perhaps
she
would
never
again
have
a
chance
to
pour
her
tears
into
a
mother
bosom
all
night
she
nestled
in
my
arms
and
i
had
no
inclination
to
slumber
the
moments
were
too
precious
to
lose
any
of
them
once
when
i
thought
she
was
asleep
i
kissed
her
forehead
softly
and
she
said
i
am
not
asleep
dear
mother
before
dawn
they
came
to
take
me
back
to
my
den
i
drew
aside
the
window
curtain
to
take
a
last
look
of
my
child
the
moonlight
shone
on
her
face
and
i
bent
over
her
as
i
had
done
years
before
that
wretched
night
when
i
ran
away
i
hugged
her
close
to
my
throbbing
heart
and
tears
too
sad
for
such
young
eyes
to
shed
flowed
down
her
cheeks
as
she
gave
her
last
kiss
and
whispered
in
my
ear
mother
i
will
never
tell
and
she
never
did
when
i
got
back
to
my
den
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
wept
there
alone
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
would
burst
when
the
time
for
ellen
departure
drew
nigh
i
could
hear
neighbors
and
friends
saying
to
her
good
by
ellen
i
hope
your
poor
mother
will
find
you
out
you
be
glad
to
see
her
she
replied
yes
and
they
little
dreamed
of
the
weighty
secret
that
weighed
down
her
young
heart
she
was
an
affectionate
child
but
naturally
very
reserved
except
with
those
she
loved
and
i
felt
secure
that
my
secret
would
be
safe
with
her
i
heard
the
gate
close
after
her
with
such
feelings
as
only
a
slave
mother
can
experience
during
the
day
my
meditations
were
very
sad
sometimes
i
feared
i
had
been
very
selfish
not
to
give
up
all
claim
to
her
and
let
her
go
to
illinois
to
be
adopted
by
sands
sister
it
was
my
experience
of
slavery
that
decided
me
against
it
i
feared
that
circumstances
might
arise
that
would
cause
her
to
be
sent
back
i
felt
confident
that
i
should
go
to
new
york
myself
and
then
i
should
be
able
to
watch
over
her
and
in
some
degree
protect
her
flint
family
knew
nothing
of
the
proposed
arrangement
till
after
ellen
was
gone
and
the
news
displeased
them
greatly
flint
called
on
sands
sister
to
inquire
into
the
matter
she
expressed
her
opinion
very
freely
as
to
the
respect
sands
showed
for
his
wife
and
for
his
own
character
in
acknowledging
those
young
niggers
and
as
for
sending
ellen
away
she
pronounced
it
to
be
just
as
much
stealing
as
it
would
be
for
him
to
come
and
take
a
piece
of
furniture
out
of
her
parlor
she
said
her
daughter
was
not
of
age
to
sign
the
bill
of
sale
and
the
children
were
her
property
and
when
she
became
of
age
or
was
married
she
could
take
them
wherever
she
could
lay
hands
on
them
miss
emily
flint
the
little
girl
to
whom
i
had
been
bequeathed
was
now
in
her
sixteenth
year
her
mother
considered
it
all
right
and
honorable
for
her
or
her
future
husband
to
steal
my
children
but
she
did
not
understand
how
any
body
could
hold
up
their
heads
in
respectable
society
after
they
had
purchased
their
own
children
as
sands
had
done
flint
said
very
little
perhaps
he
thought
that
benny
would
be
less
likely
to
be
sent
away
if
he
kept
quiet
one
of
my
letters
that
fell
into
his
hands
was
dated
from
canada
and
he
seldom
spoke
of
me
now
this
state
of
things
enabled
me
to
slip
down
into
the
storeroom
more
frequently
where
i
could
stand
upright
and
move
my
limbs
more
freely
days
weeks
and
months
passed
and
there
came
no
news
of
ellen
i
sent
a
letter
to
brooklyn
written
in
my
grandmother
name
to
inquire
whether
she
had
arrived
there
answer
was
returned
that
she
had
not
i
wrote
to
her
in
washington
but
no
notice
was
taken
of
it
there
was
one
person
there
who
ought
to
have
had
some
sympathy
with
the
anxiety
of
the
child
friends
at
home
but
the
links
of
such
relations
as
he
had
formed
with
me
are
easily
broken
and
cast
away
as
rubbish
yet
how
protectingly
and
persuasively
he
once
talked
to
the
poor
helpless
slave
girl
and
how
entirely
i
trusted
him
but
now
suspicions
darkened
my
mind
was
my
child
dead
or
had
they
deceived
me
and
sold
her
if
the
secret
memoirs
of
many
members
of
congress
should
be
published
curious
details
would
be
unfolded
i
once
saw
a
letter
from
a
member
of
congress
to
a
slave
who
was
the
mother
of
six
of
his
children
he
wrote
to
request
that
she
would
send
her
children
away
from
the
great
house
before
his
return
as
he
expected
to
be
accompanied
by
friends
the
woman
could
not
read
and
was
obliged
to
employ
another
to
read
the
letter
the
existence
of
the
colored
children
did
not
trouble
this
gentleman
it
was
only
the
fear
that
friends
might
recognize
in
their
features
a
resemblance
to
him
at
the
end
of
six
months
a
letter
came
to
my
grandmother
from
brooklyn
it
was
written
by
a
young
lady
in
the
family
and
announced
that
ellen
had
just
arrived
it
contained
the
following
message
from
her
i
do
try
to
do
just
as
you
told
me
to
and
i
pray
for
you
every
night
and
morning
i
understood
that
these
words
were
meant
for
me
and
they
were
a
balsam
to
my
heart
the
writer
closed
her
letter
by
saying
ellen
is
a
nice
little
girl
and
we
shall
like
to
have
her
with
us
my
cousin
sands
has
given
her
to
me
to
be
my
little
waiting
maid
i
shall
send
her
to
school
and
i
hope
some
day
she
will
write
to
you
herself
this
letter
perplexed
and
troubled
me
had
my
child
father
merely
placed
her
there
till
she
was
old
enough
to
support
herself
or
had
he
given
her
to
his
cousin
as
a
piece
of
property
if
the
last
idea
was
correct
his
cousin
might
return
to
the
south
at
any
time
and
hold
ellen
as
a
slave
i
tried
to
put
away
from
me
the
painful
thought
that
such
a
foul
wrong
could
have
been
done
to
us
i
said
to
myself
surely
there
must
be
justice
in
man
then
i
remembered
with
a
sigh
how
slavery
perverted
all
the
natural
feelings
of
the
human
heart
it
gave
me
a
pang
to
look
on
my
boy
he
believed
himself
free
and
to
have
him
brought
under
the
yoke
of
slavery
would
be
more
than
i
could
bear
how
i
longed
to
have
him
safely
out
of
the
reach
of
its
power
xxviii
aunt
nancy
i
have
mentioned
my
who
was
a
slave
in
flint
family
and
who
had
been
my
refuge
during
the
shameful
persecutions
i
suffered
from
him
this
aunt
had
been
married
at
twenty
years
of
age
that
is
as
far
as
slaves
marry
she
had
the
consent
of
her
master
and
mistress
and
a
clergyman
performed
the
ceremony
but
it
was
a
mere
form
without
any
legal
value
her
master
or
mistress
could
annul
it
any
day
they
pleased
she
had
always
slept
on
the
floor
in
the
entry
near
flint
chamber
door
that
she
might
be
within
call
when
she
was
married
she
was
told
she
might
have
the
use
of
a
small
room
in
an
outhouse
her
mother
and
her
husband
furnished
it
he
was
a
seafaring
man
and
was
allowed
to
sleep
there
when
he
was
at
home
but
on
the
wedding
evening
the
bride
was
ordered
to
her
old
post
on
the
entry
floor
flint
at
that
time
had
no
children
but
she
was
expecting
to
be
a
mother
and
if
she
should
want
a
drink
of
water
in
the
night
what
could
she
do
without
her
slave
to
bring
it
so
my
aunt
was
compelled
to
lie
at
her
door
until
one
midnight
she
was
forced
to
leave
to
give
premature
birth
to
a
child
in
a
fortnight
she
was
required
to
resume
her
place
on
the
entry
floor
because
flint
babe
needed
her
attentions
she
kept
her
station
there
through
summer
and
winter
until
she
had
given
premature
birth
to
six
children
and
all
the
while
she
was
employed
as
to
flint
children
finally
toiling
all
day
and
being
deprived
of
rest
at
night
completely
broke
down
her
constitution
and
flint
declared
it
was
impossible
she
could
ever
become
the
mother
of
a
living
child
the
fear
of
losing
so
valuable
a
servant
by
death
now
induced
them
to
allow
her
to
sleep
in
her
little
room
in
the
except
when
there
was
sickness
in
the
family
she
afterwards
had
two
feeble
babes
one
of
whom
died
in
a
few
days
and
the
other
in
four
weeks
i
well
remember
her
patient
sorrow
as
she
held
the
last
dead
baby
in
her
arms
i
wish
it
could
have
lived
she
said
it
is
not
the
will
of
god
that
any
of
my
children
should
live
but
i
will
try
to
be
fit
to
meet
their
little
spirits
in
heaven
aunt
nancy
was
housekeeper
and
in
flint
family
indeed
she
was
the
of
the
household
nothing
went
on
well
without
her
she
was
my
mother
twin
sister
and
as
far
as
was
in
her
power
she
supplied
a
mother
place
to
us
orphans
i
slept
with
her
all
the
time
i
lived
in
my
old
master
house
and
the
bond
between
us
was
very
strong
when
my
friends
tried
to
discourage
me
from
running
away
she
always
encouraged
me
when
they
thought
i
had
better
return
and
ask
my
pardon
because
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
she
sent
me
word
never
to
yield
she
said
if
i
persevered
i
might
perhaps
gain
the
freedom
of
my
children
and
even
if
i
perished
in
doing
it
that
was
better
than
to
leave
them
to
groan
under
the
same
persecutions
that
had
blighted
my
own
life
after
i
was
shut
up
in
my
dark
cell
she
stole
away
whenever
she
could
to
bring
me
the
news
and
say
something
cheering
how
often
did
i
kneel
down
to
listen
to
her
words
of
consolation
whispered
through
a
crack
i
am
old
and
have
not
long
to
live
she
used
to
say
and
i
could
die
happy
if
i
could
only
see
you
and
the
children
free
you
must
pray
to
god
linda
as
i
do
for
you
that
he
will
lead
you
out
of
this
darkness
i
would
beg
her
not
to
worry
herself
on
my
account
that
there
was
an
end
of
all
suffering
sooner
or
later
and
that
whether
i
lived
in
chains
or
in
freedom
i
should
always
remember
her
as
the
good
friend
who
had
been
the
comfort
of
my
life
a
word
from
her
always
strengthened
me
and
not
me
only
the
whole
family
relied
upon
her
judgement
and
were
guided
by
her
advice
i
had
been
in
my
cell
six
years
when
my
grandmother
was
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
this
her
last
remaining
daughter
she
was
very
ill
and
they
said
she
would
die
grandmother
had
not
entered
flint
house
for
several
years
they
had
treated
her
cruelly
but
she
thought
nothing
of
that
now
she
was
grateful
for
permission
to
watch
by
the
of
her
child
they
had
always
been
devoted
to
each
other
and
now
they
sat
looking
into
each
other
eyes
longing
to
speak
of
the
secret
that
had
weighed
so
much
on
the
hearts
of
both
my
aunt
had
been
stricken
with
paralysis
she
lived
but
two
days
and
the
last
day
she
was
speechless
before
she
lost
the
power
of
utterance
she
told
her
mother
not
to
grieve
if
she
could
not
speak
to
her
that
she
would
try
to
hold
up
her
hand
to
let
her
know
that
all
was
well
with
her
even
the
doctor
was
a
little
softened
when
he
saw
the
dying
woman
try
to
smile
on
the
aged
mother
who
was
kneeling
by
her
side
his
eyes
moistened
for
a
moment
as
he
said
she
had
always
been
a
faithful
servant
and
they
should
never
be
able
to
supply
her
place
flint
took
to
her
bed
quite
overcome
by
the
shock
while
my
grandmother
sat
alone
with
the
dead
the
doctor
came
in
leading
his
youngest
son
who
had
always
been
a
great
pet
with
aunt
nancy
and
was
much
attached
to
her
martha
said
he
aunt
nancy
loved
this
child
and
when
he
comes
where
you
are
i
hope
you
will
be
kind
to
him
for
her
sake
she
replied
your
wife
was
my
flint
the
of
my
poor
nancy
and
you
little
know
me
if
you
think
i
can
feel
any
thing
but
good
will
for
her
children
i
wish
the
past
could
be
forgotten
and
that
we
might
never
think
of
it
said
he
and
that
linda
would
come
to
supply
her
aunt
place
she
would
be
worth
more
to
us
than
all
the
money
that
could
be
paid
for
her
i
wish
it
for
your
sake
also
martha
now
that
nancy
is
taken
away
from
you
she
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
your
old
age
he
knew
he
was
touching
a
tender
chord
almost
choking
with
grief
my
grandmother
replied
it
was
not
i
that
drove
linda
away
my
grandchildren
are
gone
and
of
my
nine
children
only
one
is
left
god
help
me
to
me
the
death
of
this
kind
relative
was
an
inexpressible
sorrow
i
knew
that
she
had
been
slowly
murdered
and
i
felt
that
my
troubles
had
helped
to
finish
the
work
after
i
heard
of
her
illness
i
listened
constantly
to
hear
what
news
was
brought
from
the
great
house
and
the
thought
that
i
could
not
go
to
her
made
me
utterly
miserable
at
last
as
uncle
phillip
came
into
the
house
i
heard
some
one
inquire
how
is
she
and
he
answered
she
is
dead
my
little
cell
seemed
whirling
round
and
i
knew
nothing
more
till
i
opened
my
eyes
and
found
uncle
phillip
bending
over
me
i
had
no
need
to
ask
any
questions
he
whispered
linda
she
died
happy
i
could
not
weep
my
fixed
gaze
troubled
him
do
look
he
said
do
add
to
my
poor
mother
trouble
remember
how
much
she
has
to
bear
and
that
we
ought
to
do
all
we
can
to
comfort
her
ah
yes
that
blessed
old
grandmother
who
for
years
had
borne
the
pelting
storms
of
a
life
she
did
indeed
need
consolation
flint
had
rendered
her
poor
childless
apparently
without
any
compunction
and
with
cruel
selfishness
had
ruined
her
health
by
years
of
incessant
unrequited
toil
and
broken
rest
but
now
she
became
very
sentimental
i
suppose
she
thought
it
would
be
a
beautiful
illustration
of
the
attachment
existing
between
slaveholder
and
slave
if
the
body
of
her
old
servant
was
buried
at
her
feet
she
sent
for
the
clergyman
and
asked
if
he
had
any
objection
to
burying
aunt
nancy
in
the
doctor
family
no
colored
person
had
ever
been
allowed
interment
in
the
white
people
and
the
minister
knew
that
all
the
deceased
of
your
family
reposed
together
in
the
old
graveyard
of
the
slaves
he
therefore
replied
i
have
no
objection
to
complying
with
your
wish
but
perhaps
aunt
nancy
may
have
some
choice
as
to
where
her
remains
shall
be
deposited
it
had
never
occurred
to
flint
that
slaves
could
have
any
feelings
when
my
grandmother
was
consulted
she
at
once
said
she
wanted
nancy
to
lie
with
all
the
rest
of
her
family
and
where
her
own
old
body
would
be
buried
flint
graciously
complied
with
her
wish
though
she
said
it
was
painful
to
her
to
have
nancy
buried
away
from
she
might
have
added
with
touching
pathos
i
was
so
long
to
sleep
with
her
lying
near
me
on
the
entry
floor
my
uncle
phillip
asked
permission
to
bury
his
sister
at
his
own
expense
and
slaveholders
are
always
ready
to
grant
favors
to
slaves
and
their
relatives
the
arrangements
were
very
plain
but
perfectly
respectable
she
was
buried
on
the
sabbath
and
flint
minister
read
the
funeral
service
there
was
a
large
concourse
of
colored
people
bond
and
free
and
a
few
white
persons
who
had
always
been
friendly
to
our
family
flint
carriage
was
in
the
procession
and
when
the
body
was
deposited
in
its
humble
resting
place
the
mistress
dropped
a
tear
and
returned
to
her
carriage
probably
thinking
she
had
performed
her
duty
nobly
it
was
talked
of
by
the
slaves
as
a
mighty
grand
funeral
northern
travellers
passing
through
the
place
might
have
described
this
tribute
of
respect
to
the
humble
dead
as
a
beautiful
feature
in
the
patriarchal
institution
a
touching
proof
of
the
attachment
between
slaveholders
and
their
servants
and
flint
would
have
confirmed
this
impression
with
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
could
have
told
them
a
different
story
we
could
have
given
them
a
chapter
of
wrongs
and
sufferings
that
would
have
touched
their
hearts
if
they
any
hearts
to
feel
for
the
colored
people
we
could
have
told
them
how
the
poor
old
had
toiled
year
after
year
to
earn
eight
hundred
dollars
to
buy
her
son
phillip
right
to
his
own
earnings
and
how
that
same
phillip
paid
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
which
they
regarded
as
doing
so
much
credit
to
the
master
we
could
also
have
told
them
of
a
poor
blighted
young
creature
shut
up
in
a
living
grave
for
years
to
avoid
the
tortures
that
would
be
inflicted
on
her
if
she
ventured
to
come
out
and
look
on
the
face
of
her
departed
friend
all
this
and
much
more
i
thought
of
as
i
sat
at
my
loophole
waiting
for
the
family
to
return
from
the
grave
sometimes
weeping
sometimes
falling
asleep
dreaming
strange
dreams
of
the
dead
and
the
living
it
was
sad
to
witness
the
grief
of
my
bereaved
grandmother
she
had
always
been
strong
to
bear
and
now
as
ever
religious
faith
supported
her
but
her
dark
life
had
become
still
darker
and
age
and
trouble
were
leaving
deep
traces
on
her
withered
face
she
had
four
places
to
knock
for
me
to
come
to
the
trapdoor
and
each
place
had
a
different
meaning
she
now
came
oftener
than
she
had
done
and
talked
to
me
of
her
dead
daughter
while
tears
trickled
slowly
down
her
furrowed
cheeks
i
said
all
i
could
to
comfort
her
but
it
was
a
sad
reflection
that
instead
of
being
able
to
help
her
i
was
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
and
trouble
the
poor
old
back
was
fitted
to
its
burden
it
bent
under
it
but
did
not
break
xxix
preparations
for
escape
i
hardly
expect
that
the
reader
will
credit
me
when
i
affirm
that
i
lived
in
that
little
dismal
hole
almost
deprived
of
light
and
air
and
with
no
space
to
move
my
limbs
for
nearly
seven
years
but
it
is
a
fact
and
to
me
a
sad
one
even
now
for
my
body
still
suffers
from
the
effects
of
that
long
imprisonment
to
say
nothing
of
my
soul
members
of
my
family
now
living
in
new
york
and
boston
can
testify
to
the
truth
of
what
i
say
countless
were
the
nights
that
i
sat
late
at
the
little
loophole
scarcely
large
enough
to
give
me
a
glimpse
of
one
twinkling
star
there
heard
the
patrols
and
conferring
together
about
the
capture
of
runaways
well
knowing
how
rejoiced
they
would
be
to
catch
me
season
after
season
year
after
year
i
peeped
at
my
children
faces
and
heard
their
sweet
voices
with
a
heart
yearning
all
the
while
to
say
your
mother
is
here
sometimes
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
ages
had
rolled
away
since
i
entered
upon
that
gloomy
monotonous
existence
at
times
i
was
stupefied
and
listless
at
other
times
i
became
very
impatient
to
know
when
these
dark
years
would
end
and
i
should
again
be
allowed
to
feel
the
sunshine
and
breathe
the
pure
air
after
ellen
left
us
this
feeling
increased
sands
had
agreed
that
benny
might
go
to
the
north
whenever
his
uncle
phillip
could
go
with
him
and
i
was
anxious
to
be
there
also
to
watch
over
my
children
and
protect
them
so
far
as
i
was
able
moreover
i
was
likely
to
be
drowned
out
of
my
den
if
i
remained
much
longer
for
the
slight
roof
was
getting
badly
out
of
repair
and
uncle
phillip
was
afraid
to
remove
the
shingles
lest
some
one
should
get
a
glimpse
of
me
when
storms
occurred
in
the
night
they
spread
mats
and
bits
of
carpet
which
in
the
morning
appeared
to
have
been
laid
out
to
dry
but
to
cover
the
roof
in
the
daytime
might
have
attracted
attention
consequently
my
clothes
and
bedding
were
often
drenched
a
process
by
which
the
pains
and
aches
in
my
cramped
and
stiffened
limbs
were
greatly
increased
i
revolved
various
plans
of
escape
in
my
mind
which
i
sometimes
imparted
to
my
grandmother
when
she
came
to
whisper
with
me
at
the
the
old
woman
had
an
intense
sympathy
for
runaways
she
had
known
too
much
of
the
cruelties
inflicted
on
those
who
were
captured
her
memory
always
flew
back
at
once
to
the
sufferings
of
her
bright
and
handsome
son
benjamin
the
youngest
and
dearest
of
her
flock
so
whenever
i
alluded
to
the
subject
she
would
groan
out
o
do
think
of
it
child
you
break
my
heart
i
had
no
good
old
aunt
nancy
now
to
encourage
me
but
my
brother
william
and
my
children
were
continually
beckoning
me
to
the
north
and
now
i
must
go
back
a
few
months
in
my
story
i
have
stated
that
the
first
of
january
was
the
time
for
selling
slaves
or
leasing
them
out
to
new
masters
if
time
were
counted
by
the
poor
slaves
might
reckon
years
of
suffering
during
that
festival
so
joyous
to
the
free
on
the
new
year
day
preceding
my
aunt
death
one
of
my
friends
named
fanny
was
to
be
sold
at
auction
to
pay
her
master
debts
my
thoughts
were
with
her
during
all
the
day
and
at
night
i
anxiously
inquired
what
had
been
her
fate
i
was
told
that
she
had
been
sold
to
one
master
and
her
four
little
girls
to
another
master
far
distant
that
she
had
escaped
from
her
purchaser
and
was
not
to
be
found
her
mother
was
the
old
aggie
i
have
spoken
of
she
lived
in
a
small
tenement
belonging
to
my
grandmother
and
built
on
the
same
lot
with
her
own
house
her
dwelling
was
searched
and
watched
and
that
brought
the
patrols
so
near
me
that
i
was
obliged
to
keep
very
close
in
my
den
the
hunters
were
somehow
eluded
and
not
long
afterwards
benny
accidentally
caught
sight
of
fanny
in
her
mother
hut
he
told
his
grandmother
who
charged
him
never
to
speak
of
it
explaining
to
him
the
frightful
consequences
and
he
never
betrayed
the
trust
aggie
little
dreamed
that
my
grandmother
knew
where
her
daughter
was
concealed
and
that
the
stooping
form
of
her
old
neighbor
was
bending
under
a
similar
burden
of
anxiety
and
fear
but
these
dangerous
secrets
deepened
the
sympathy
between
the
two
old
persecuted
mothers
my
friend
fanny
and
i
remained
many
weeks
hidden
within
call
of
each
other
but
she
was
unconscious
of
the
fact
i
longed
to
have
her
share
my
den
which
seemed
a
more
secure
retreat
than
her
own
but
i
had
brought
so
much
trouble
on
my
grandmother
that
it
seemed
wrong
to
ask
her
to
incur
greater
risks
my
restlessness
increased
i
had
lived
too
long
in
bodily
pain
and
anguish
of
spirit
always
i
was
in
dread
that
by
some
accident
or
some
contrivance
slavery
would
succeed
in
snatching
my
children
from
me
this
thought
drove
me
nearly
frantic
and
i
determined
to
steer
for
the
north
star
at
all
hazards
at
this
crisis
providence
opened
an
unexpected
way
for
me
to
escape
my
friend
peter
came
one
evening
and
asked
to
speak
with
me
your
day
has
come
linda
said
he
i
have
found
a
chance
for
you
to
go
to
the
free
states
you
have
a
fortnight
to
decide
the
news
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
but
peter
explained
his
arrangements
and
told
me
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
me
to
say
i
would
go
i
was
going
to
answer
him
with
a
joyful
yes
when
the
thought
of
benny
came
to
my
mind
i
told
him
the
temptation
was
exceedingly
strong
but
i
was
terribly
afraid
of
alleged
power
over
my
child
and
that
i
could
not
go
and
leave
him
behind
peter
remonstrated
earnestly
he
said
such
a
good
chance
might
never
occur
again
that
benny
was
free
and
could
be
sent
to
me
and
that
for
the
sake
of
my
children
welfare
i
ought
not
to
hesitate
a
moment
i
told
him
i
would
consult
with
uncle
phillip
my
uncle
rejoiced
in
the
plan
and
bade
me
go
by
all
means
he
promised
if
his
life
was
spared
that
he
would
either
bring
or
send
my
son
to
me
as
soon
as
i
reached
a
place
of
safety
i
resolved
to
go
but
thought
nothing
had
better
be
said
to
my
grandmother
till
very
near
the
time
of
departure
but
my
uncle
thought
she
would
feel
it
more
keenly
if
i
left
here
so
suddenly
i
will
reason
with
her
said
he
and
convince
her
how
necessary
it
is
not
only
for
your
sake
but
for
hers
also
you
can
not
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
she
is
sinking
under
her
burdens
i
was
not
blind
to
it
i
knew
that
my
concealment
was
an
source
of
anxiety
and
that
the
older
she
grew
the
more
nervously
fearful
she
was
of
discovery
my
uncle
talked
with
her
and
finally
succeeded
in
persuading
her
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
seize
the
chance
so
unexpectedly
offered
the
anticipation
of
being
a
free
woman
proved
almost
too
much
for
my
weak
frame
the
excitement
stimulated
me
and
at
the
same
time
bewildered
me
i
made
busy
preparations
for
my
journey
and
for
my
son
to
follow
me
i
resolved
to
have
an
interview
with
him
before
i
went
that
i
might
give
him
cautions
and
advice
and
tell
him
how
anxiously
i
should
be
waiting
for
him
at
the
north
grandmother
stole
up
to
me
as
often
as
possible
to
whisper
words
of
counsel
she
insisted
upon
writing
to
flint
as
soon
as
i
arrived
in
the
free
states
and
asking
him
to
sell
me
to
her
she
said
she
would
sacrifice
her
house
and
all
she
had
in
the
world
for
the
sake
of
having
me
safe
with
my
children
in
any
part
of
the
world
if
she
could
only
live
to
know
she
could
die
in
peace
i
promised
the
dear
old
faithful
friend
that
i
would
write
to
her
as
soon
as
i
arrived
and
put
the
letter
in
a
safe
way
to
reach
her
but
in
my
own
mind
i
resolved
that
not
another
cent
of
her
hard
earnings
should
be
spent
to
pay
rapacious
slaveholders
for
what
they
called
their
property
and
even
if
i
had
not
been
unwilling
to
buy
what
i
had
already
a
right
to
possess
common
humanity
would
have
prevented
me
from
accepting
the
generous
offer
at
the
expense
of
turning
my
aged
relative
out
of
house
and
home
when
she
was
trembling
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
i
was
to
escape
in
a
vessel
but
i
forbear
to
mention
any
further
particulars
i
was
in
readiness
but
the
vessel
was
unexpectedly
detained
several
days
meantime
news
came
to
town
of
a
most
horrible
murder
committed
on
a
fugitive
slave
named
james
charity
the
mother
of
this
unfortunate
young
man
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
of
ours
i
have
told
the
shocking
particulars
of
his
death
in
my
description
of
some
of
the
neighboring
slaveholders
my
grandmother
always
nervously
sensitive
about
runaways
was
terribly
frightened
she
felt
sure
that
a
similar
fate
awaited
me
if
i
did
not
desist
from
my
enterprise
she
sobbed
and
groaned
and
entreated
me
not
to
go
her
excessive
fear
was
somewhat
contagious
and
my
heart
was
not
proof
against
her
extreme
agony
i
was
grievously
disappointed
but
i
promised
to
relinquish
my
project
when
my
friend
peter
was
apprised
of
this
he
was
both
disappointed
and
vexed
he
said
that
judging
from
our
past
experience
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
i
had
such
another
chance
to
throw
away
i
told
him
it
need
not
be
thrown
away
that
i
had
a
friend
concealed
near
by
who
would
be
glad
enough
to
take
the
place
that
had
been
provided
for
me
i
told
him
about
poor
fanny
and
the
noble
fellow
who
never
turned
his
back
upon
any
body
in
distress
white
or
black
expressed
his
readiness
to
help
her
aggie
was
much
surprised
when
she
found
that
we
knew
her
secret
she
was
rejoiced
to
hear
of
such
a
chance
for
fanny
and
arrangements
were
made
for
her
to
go
on
board
the
vessel
the
next
night
they
both
supposed
that
i
had
long
been
at
the
north
therefore
my
name
was
not
mentioned
in
the
transaction
fanny
was
carried
on
board
at
the
appointed
time
and
stowed
away
in
a
very
small
cabin
this
accommodation
had
been
purchased
at
a
price
that
would
pay
for
a
voyage
to
england
but
when
one
proposes
to
go
to
fine
old
england
they
stop
to
calculate
whether
they
can
afford
the
cost
of
the
pleasure
while
in
making
a
bargain
to
escape
from
slavery
the
trembling
victim
is
ready
to
say
take
all
i
have
only
do
betray
me
the
next
morning
i
peeped
through
my
loophole
and
saw
that
it
was
dark
and
cloudy
at
night
i
received
news
that
the
wind
was
ahead
and
the
vessel
had
not
sailed
i
was
exceedingly
anxious
about
fanny
and
peter
too
who
was
running
a
tremendous
risk
at
my
instigation
next
day
the
wind
and
weather
remained
the
same
poor
fanny
had
been
half
dead
with
fright
when
they
carried
her
on
board
and
i
could
readily
imagine
how
she
must
be
suffering
now
grandmother
came
often
to
my
den
to
say
how
thankful
she
was
i
did
not
go
on
the
third
morning
she
rapped
for
me
to
come
down
to
the
storeroom
the
poor
old
sufferer
was
breaking
down
under
her
weight
of
trouble
she
was
easily
flurried
now
i
found
her
in
a
nervous
excited
state
but
i
was
not
aware
that
she
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
behind
her
as
usual
she
was
exceedingly
worried
about
the
detention
of
the
vessel
she
was
afraid
all
would
be
discovered
and
then
fanny
and
peter
and
i
would
all
be
tortured
to
death
and
phillip
would
be
utterly
ruined
and
her
house
would
be
torn
down
poor
peter
if
he
should
die
such
a
horrible
death
as
the
poor
slave
james
had
lately
done
and
all
for
his
kindness
in
trying
to
help
me
how
dreadful
it
would
be
for
us
all
alas
the
thought
was
familiar
to
me
and
had
sent
many
a
sharp
pang
through
my
heart
i
tried
to
suppress
my
own
anxiety
and
speak
soothingly
to
her
she
brought
in
some
allusion
to
aunt
nancy
the
dear
daughter
she
had
recently
buried
and
then
she
lost
all
control
of
herself
as
she
stood
there
trembling
and
sobbing
a
voice
from
the
piazza
called
out
whar
is
you
aunt
marthy
grandmother
was
startled
and
in
her
agitation
opened
the
door
without
thinking
of
me
in
stepped
jenny
the
mischievous
housemaid
who
had
tried
to
enter
my
room
when
i
was
concealed
in
the
house
of
my
white
benefactress
i
bin
huntin
ebery
whar
for
you
aunt
marthy
said
she
my
missis
wants
you
to
send
her
some
crackers
i
had
slunk
down
behind
a
barrel
which
entirely
screened
me
but
i
imagined
that
jenny
was
looking
directly
at
the
spot
and
my
heart
beat
violently
my
grandmother
immediately
thought
what
she
had
done
and
went
out
quickly
with
jenny
to
count
the
crackers
locking
the
door
after
her
she
returned
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
the
perfect
picture
of
despair
poor
child
she
exclaimed
my
carelessness
has
ruined
you
the
boat
ai
gone
yet
get
ready
immediately
and
go
with
fanny
i
ai
got
another
word
to
say
against
it
now
for
there
no
telling
what
may
happen
this
day
uncle
phillip
was
sent
for
and
he
agreed
with
his
mother
in
thinking
that
jenny
would
inform
flint
in
less
than
hours
he
advised
getting
me
on
board
the
boat
if
possible
if
not
i
had
better
keep
very
still
in
my
den
where
they
could
not
find
me
without
tearing
the
house
down
he
said
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
move
in
the
matter
because
suspicion
would
be
immediately
excited
but
he
promised
to
communicate
with
peter
i
felt
reluctant
to
apply
to
him
again
having
implicated
him
too
much
already
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
vexed
as
peter
had
been
by
my
indecision
he
was
true
to
his
generous
nature
and
said
at
once
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
help
me
trusting
i
should
show
myself
a
stronger
woman
this
time
he
immediately
proceeded
to
the
wharf
and
found
that
the
wind
had
shifted
and
the
vessel
was
slowly
beating
down
stream
on
some
pretext
of
urgent
necessity
he
offered
two
boatmen
a
dollar
apiece
to
catch
up
with
her
he
was
of
lighter
complexion
than
the
boatmen
he
hired
and
when
the
captain
saw
them
coming
so
rapidly
he
thought
officers
were
pursuing
his
vessel
in
search
of
the
runaway
slave
he
had
on
board
they
hoisted
sails
but
the
boat
gained
upon
them
and
the
indefatigable
peter
sprang
on
board
the
captain
at
once
recognized
him
peter
asked
him
to
go
below
to
speak
about
a
bad
bill
he
had
given
him
when
he
told
his
errand
the
captain
replied
why
the
woman
here
already
and
i
put
her
where
you
or
the
devil
would
have
a
tough
job
to
find
her
but
it
is
another
woman
i
want
to
bring
said
peter
is
in
great
distress
too
and
you
shall
be
paid
any
thing
within
reason
if
stop
and
take
her
what
her
name
inquired
the
captain
linda
he
replied
that
the
name
of
the
woman
already
here
rejoined
the
captain
by
george
i
believe
you
mean
to
betray
me
o
exclaimed
peter
god
knows
i
would
harm
a
hair
of
your
head
i
am
too
grateful
to
you
but
there
really
another
woman
in
great
danger
do
have
the
humanity
to
stop
and
take
her
after
a
while
they
came
to
an
understanding
fanny
not
dreaming
i
was
any
where
about
in
that
region
had
assumed
my
name
though
she
called
herself
johnson
linda
is
a
common
name
said
peter
and
the
woman
i
want
to
bring
is
linda
brent
the
captain
agreed
to
wait
at
a
certain
place
till
evening
being
handsomely
paid
for
his
detention
of
course
the
day
was
an
anxious
one
for
us
all
but
we
concluded
that
if
jenny
had
seen
me
she
would
be
too
wise
to
let
her
mistress
know
of
it
and
that
she
probably
would
not
get
a
chance
to
see
flint
family
till
evening
for
i
knew
very
well
what
were
the
rules
in
that
household
i
afterwards
believed
that
she
did
not
see
me
for
nothing
ever
came
of
it
and
she
was
one
of
those
base
characters
that
would
have
jumped
to
betray
a
suffering
fellow
being
for
the
sake
of
thirty
pieces
of
silver
i
made
all
my
arrangements
to
go
on
board
as
soon
as
it
was
dusk
the
intervening
time
i
resolved
to
spend
with
my
son
i
had
not
spoken
to
him
for
seven
years
though
i
had
been
under
the
same
roof
and
seen
him
every
day
when
i
was
well
enough
to
sit
at
the
loophole
i
did
not
dare
to
venture
beyond
the
storeroom
so
they
brought
him
there
and
locked
us
up
together
in
a
place
concealed
from
the
piazza
door
it
was
an
agitating
interview
for
both
of
us
after
we
had
talked
and
wept
together
for
a
little
while
he
said
mother
i
glad
you
going
away
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
i
knew
you
was
here
and
i
have
been
afraid
they
would
come
and
catch
you
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
asked
him
how
he
had
found
it
out
he
replied
i
was
standing
under
the
eaves
one
day
before
ellen
went
away
and
i
heard
somebody
cough
up
over
the
wood
shed
i
do
know
what
made
me
think
it
was
you
but
i
did
think
so
i
missed
ellen
the
night
before
she
went
away
and
grandmother
brought
her
back
into
the
room
in
the
night
and
i
thought
maybe
she
been
to
see
before
she
went
for
i
heard
grandmother
whisper
to
her
go
to
sleep
and
remember
never
to
tell
i
asked
him
if
he
ever
mentioned
his
suspicions
to
his
sister
he
said
he
never
did
but
after
he
heard
the
cough
if
he
saw
her
playing
with
other
children
on
that
side
of
the
house
he
always
tried
to
coax
her
round
to
the
other
side
for
fear
they
would
hear
me
cough
too
he
said
he
had
kept
a
close
lookout
for
flint
and
if
he
saw
him
speak
to
a
constable
or
a
patrol
he
always
told
grandmother
i
now
recollected
that
i
had
seen
him
manifest
uneasiness
when
people
were
on
that
side
of
the
house
and
i
had
at
the
time
been
puzzled
to
conjecture
a
motive
for
his
actions
such
prudence
may
seem
extraordinary
in
a
boy
of
twelve
years
but
slaves
being
surrounded
by
mysteries
deceptions
and
dangers
early
learn
to
be
suspicious
and
watchful
and
prematurely
cautious
and
cunning
he
had
never
asked
a
question
of
grandmother
or
uncle
phillip
and
i
had
often
heard
him
chime
in
with
other
children
when
they
spoke
of
my
being
at
the
north
i
told
him
i
was
now
really
going
to
the
free
states
and
if
he
was
a
good
honest
boy
and
a
loving
child
to
his
dear
old
grandmother
the
lord
would
bless
him
and
bring
him
to
me
and
we
and
ellen
would
live
together
he
began
to
tell
me
that
grandmother
had
not
eaten
any
thing
all
day
while
he
was
speaking
the
door
was
unlocked
and
she
came
in
with
a
small
bag
of
money
which
she
wanted
me
to
take
i
begged
her
to
keep
a
part
of
it
at
least
to
pay
for
benny
being
sent
to
the
north
but
she
insisted
while
her
tears
were
falling
fast
that
i
should
take
the
whole
you
may
be
sick
among
strangers
she
said
and
they
would
send
you
to
the
poorhouse
to
die
ah
that
good
grandmother
for
the
last
time
i
went
up
to
my
nook
its
desolate
appearance
no
longer
chilled
me
for
the
light
of
hope
had
risen
in
my
soul
yet
even
with
the
blessed
prospect
of
freedom
before
me
i
felt
very
sad
at
leaving
forever
that
old
homestead
where
i
had
been
sheltered
so
long
by
the
dear
old
grandmother
where
i
had
dreamed
my
first
young
dream
of
love
and
where
after
that
had
faded
away
my
children
came
to
twine
themselves
so
closely
round
my
desolate
heart
as
the
hour
approached
for
me
to
leave
i
again
descended
to
the
storeroom
my
grandmother
and
benny
were
there
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
linda
let
us
pray
we
knelt
down
together
with
my
child
pressed
to
my
heart
and
my
other
arm
round
the
faithful
loving
old
friend
i
was
about
to
leave
forever
on
no
other
occasion
has
it
ever
been
my
lot
to
listen
to
so
fervent
a
supplication
for
mercy
and
protection
it
thrilled
through
my
heart
and
inspired
me
with
trust
in
god
peter
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
street
i
was
soon
by
his
side
faint
in
body
but
strong
of
purpose
i
did
not
look
back
upon
the
old
place
though
i
felt
that
i
should
never
see
it
again
xxx
northward
bound
i
never
could
tell
how
we
reached
the
wharf
my
brain
was
all
of
a
whirl
and
my
limbs
tottered
under
me
at
an
appointed
place
we
met
my
uncle
phillip
who
had
started
before
us
on
a
different
route
that
he
might
reach
the
wharf
first
and
give
us
timely
warning
if
there
was
any
danger
a
was
in
readiness
as
i
was
about
to
step
in
i
felt
something
pull
me
gently
and
turning
round
i
saw
benny
looking
pale
and
anxious
he
whispered
in
my
ear
i
been
peeping
into
the
doctor
window
and
at
home
good
by
mother
do
cry
i
come
he
hastened
away
i
clasped
the
hand
of
my
good
uncle
to
whom
i
owed
so
much
and
of
peter
the
brave
generous
friend
who
had
volunteered
to
run
such
terrible
risks
to
secure
my
safety
to
this
day
i
remember
how
his
bright
face
beamed
with
joy
when
he
told
me
he
had
discovered
a
safe
method
for
me
to
escape
yet
that
intelligent
enterprising
man
was
a
chattel
liable
by
the
laws
of
a
country
that
calls
itself
civilized
to
be
sold
with
horses
and
pigs
we
parted
in
silence
our
hearts
were
all
too
full
for
words
swiftly
the
boat
glided
over
the
water
after
a
while
one
of
the
sailors
said
do
be
madam
we
will
take
you
safely
to
your
husband
in
at
first
i
could
not
imagine
what
he
meant
but
i
had
presence
of
mind
to
think
that
it
probably
referred
to
something
the
captain
had
told
him
so
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
hoped
we
should
have
pleasant
weather
when
i
entered
the
vessel
the
captain
came
forward
to
meet
me
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
pleasant
countenance
he
showed
me
to
a
little
box
of
a
cabin
where
sat
my
friend
fanny
she
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
spectre
she
gazed
on
me
in
utter
astonishment
and
exclaimed
linda
can
this
be
or
is
it
your
ghost
when
we
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
my
overwrought
feelings
could
no
longer
be
restrained
my
sobs
reached
the
ears
of
the
captain
who
came
and
very
kindly
reminded
us
that
for
his
safety
as
well
as
our
own
it
would
be
prudent
for
us
not
to
attract
any
attention
he
said
that
when
there
was
a
sail
in
sight
he
wished
us
to
keep
below
but
at
other
times
he
had
no
objection
to
our
being
on
deck
he
assured
us
that
he
would
keep
a
good
lookout
and
if
we
acted
prudently
he
thought
we
should
be
in
no
danger
he
had
represented
us
as
women
going
to
meet
our
husbands
in
we
thanked
him
and
promised
to
observe
carefully
all
the
directions
he
gave
us
fanny
and
i
now
talked
by
ourselves
low
and
quietly
in
our
little
cabin
she
told
me
of
the
suffering
she
had
gone
through
in
making
her
escape
and
of
her
terrors
while
she
was
concealed
in
her
mother
house
above
all
she
dwelt
on
the
agony
of
separation
from
all
her
children
on
that
dreadful
auction
day
she
could
scarcely
credit
me
when
i
told
her
of
the
place
where
i
had
passed
nearly
seven
years
we
have
the
same
sorrows
said
i
no
replied
she
you
are
going
to
see
your
children
soon
and
there
is
no
hope
that
i
shall
ever
even
hear
from
mine
the
vessel
was
soon
under
way
but
we
made
slow
progress
the
wind
was
against
us
i
should
not
have
cared
for
this
if
we
had
been
out
of
sight
of
the
town
but
until
there
were
miles
of
water
between
us
and
our
enemies
we
were
filled
with
constant
apprehensions
that
the
constables
would
come
on
board
neither
could
i
feel
quite
at
ease
with
the
captain
and
his
men
i
was
an
entire
stranger
to
that
class
of
people
and
i
had
heard
that
sailors
were
rough
and
sometimes
cruel
we
were
so
completely
in
their
power
that
if
they
were
bad
men
our
situation
would
be
dreadful
now
that
the
captain
was
paid
for
our
passage
might
he
not
be
tempted
to
make
more
money
by
giving
us
up
to
those
who
claimed
us
as
property
i
was
naturally
of
a
confiding
disposition
but
slavery
had
made
me
suspicious
of
every
body
fanny
did
not
share
my
distrust
of
the
captain
or
his
men
she
said
she
was
afraid
at
first
but
she
had
been
on
board
three
days
while
the
vessel
lay
in
the
dock
and
nobody
had
betrayed
her
or
treated
her
otherwise
than
kindly
the
captain
soon
came
to
advise
us
to
go
on
deck
for
fresh
air
his
friendly
and
respectful
manner
combined
with
fanny
testimony
reassured
me
and
we
went
with
him
he
placed
us
in
a
comfortable
seat
and
occasionally
entered
into
conversation
he
told
us
he
was
a
southerner
by
birth
and
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
the
slave
states
and
that
he
had
recently
lost
a
brother
who
traded
in
slaves
but
said
he
it
is
a
pitiable
and
degrading
business
and
i
always
felt
ashamed
to
acknowledge
my
brother
in
connection
with
it
as
we
passed
snaky
swamp
he
pointed
to
it
and
said
there
is
a
slave
territory
that
defies
all
the
laws
i
thought
of
the
terrible
days
i
had
spent
there
and
though
it
was
not
called
dismal
swamp
it
made
me
feel
very
dismal
as
i
looked
at
it
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
the
balmy
air
of
spring
was
so
refreshing
and
how
shall
i
describe
my
sensations
when
we
were
fairly
sailing
on
chesapeake
bay
o
the
beautiful
sunshine
the
exhilarating
breeze
and
i
could
enjoy
them
without
fear
or
restraint
i
had
never
realized
what
grand
things
air
and
sunlight
are
till
i
had
been
deprived
of
them
ten
days
after
we
left
land
we
were
approaching
philadelphia
the
captain
said
we
should
arrive
there
in
the
night
but
he
thought
we
had
better
wait
till
morning
and
go
on
shore
in
broad
daylight
as
the
best
way
to
avoid
suspicion
i
replied
you
know
best
but
will
you
stay
on
board
and
protect
us
he
saw
that
i
was
suspicious
and
he
said
he
was
sorry
now
that
he
had
brought
us
to
the
end
of
our
voyage
to
find
i
had
so
little
confidence
in
him
ah
if
he
had
ever
been
a
slave
he
would
have
known
how
difficult
it
was
to
trust
a
white
man
he
assured
us
that
we
might
sleep
through
the
night
without
fear
that
he
would
take
care
we
were
not
left
unprotected
be
it
said
to
the
honor
of
this
captain
southerner
as
he
was
that
if
fanny
and
i
had
been
white
ladies
and
our
passage
lawfully
engaged
he
could
not
have
treated
us
more
respectfully
my
intelligent
friend
peter
had
rightly
estimated
the
character
of
the
man
to
whose
honor
he
had
intrusted
us
the
next
morning
i
was
on
deck
as
soon
as
the
day
dawned
i
called
fanny
to
see
the
sun
rise
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
on
free
soil
for
such
i
believed
it
to
be
we
watched
the
reddening
sky
and
saw
the
great
orb
come
up
slowly
out
of
the
water
as
it
seemed
soon
the
waves
began
to
sparkle
and
every
thing
caught
the
beautiful
glow
before
us
lay
the
city
of
strangers
we
looked
at
each
other
and
the
eyes
of
both
were
moistened
with
tears
we
had
escaped
from
slavery
and
we
supposed
ourselves
to
be
safe
from
the
hunters
but
we
were
alone
in
the
world
and
we
had
left
dear
ties
behind
us
ties
cruelly
sundered
by
the
demon
slavery
xxxi
incidents
in
philadelphia
i
had
heard
that
the
poor
slave
had
many
friends
at
the
north
i
trusted
we
should
find
some
of
them
meantime
we
would
take
it
for
granted
that
all
were
friends
till
they
proved
to
the
contrary
i
sought
out
the
kind
captain
thanked
him
for
his
attentions
and
told
him
i
should
never
cease
to
be
grateful
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
us
i
gave
him
a
message
to
the
friends
i
had
left
at
home
and
he
promised
to
deliver
it
we
were
placed
in
a
and
in
about
fifteen
minutes
were
landed
on
a
wood
wharf
in
philadelphia
as
i
stood
looking
round
the
friendly
captain
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
there
is
a
colored
man
behind
you
i
will
speak
to
him
about
the
new
york
trains
and
tell
him
you
wish
to
go
directly
on
i
thanked
him
and
asked
him
to
direct
me
to
some
shops
where
i
could
buy
gloves
and
veils
he
did
so
and
said
he
would
talk
with
the
colored
man
till
i
returned
i
made
what
haste
i
could
constant
exercise
on
board
the
vessel
and
frequent
rubbing
with
salt
water
had
nearly
restored
the
use
of
my
limbs
the
noise
of
the
great
city
confused
me
but
i
found
the
shops
and
bought
some
double
veils
and
gloves
for
fanny
and
myself
the
shopman
told
me
they
were
so
many
levies
i
had
never
heard
the
word
before
but
i
did
not
tell
him
so
i
thought
if
he
knew
i
was
a
stranger
he
might
ask
me
where
i
came
from
i
gave
him
a
gold
piece
and
when
he
returned
the
change
i
counted
it
and
found
out
how
much
a
levy
was
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
wharf
where
the
captain
introduced
me
to
the
colored
man
as
the
rev
jeremiah
durham
minister
of
bethel
church
he
took
me
by
the
hand
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
friend
he
told
us
we
were
too
late
for
the
morning
cars
to
new
york
and
must
wait
until
the
evening
or
the
next
morning
he
invited
me
to
go
home
with
him
assuring
me
that
his
wife
would
give
me
a
cordial
welcome
and
for
my
friend
he
would
provide
a
home
with
one
of
his
neighbors
i
thanked
him
for
so
much
kindness
to
strangers
and
told
him
if
i
must
be
detained
i
should
like
to
hunt
up
some
people
who
formerly
went
from
our
part
of
the
country
durham
insisted
that
i
should
dine
with
him
and
then
he
would
assist
me
in
finding
my
friends
the
sailors
came
to
bid
us
good
by
i
shook
their
hardy
hands
with
tears
in
my
eyes
they
had
all
been
kind
to
us
and
they
had
rendered
us
a
greater
service
than
they
could
possibly
conceive
of
i
had
never
seen
so
large
a
city
or
been
in
contact
with
so
many
people
in
the
streets
it
seemed
as
if
those
who
passed
looked
at
us
with
an
expression
of
curiosity
my
face
was
so
blistered
and
peeled
by
sitting
on
deck
in
wind
and
sunshine
that
i
thought
they
could
not
easily
decide
to
what
nation
i
belonged
durham
met
me
with
a
kindly
welcome
without
asking
any
questions
i
was
tired
and
her
friendly
manner
was
a
sweet
refreshment
god
bless
her
i
was
sure
that
she
had
comforted
other
weary
hearts
before
i
received
her
sympathy
she
was
surrounded
by
her
husband
and
children
in
a
home
made
sacred
by
protecting
laws
i
thought
of
my
own
children
and
sighed
after
dinner
durham
went
with
me
in
quest
of
the
friends
i
had
spoken
of
they
went
from
my
native
town
and
i
anticipated
much
pleasure
in
looking
on
familiar
faces
they
were
not
at
home
and
we
retracted
our
steps
through
streets
delightfully
clean
on
the
way
durham
observed
that
i
had
spoken
to
him
of
a
daughter
i
expected
to
meet
that
he
was
surprised
for
i
looked
so
young
he
had
taken
me
for
a
single
woman
he
was
approaching
a
subject
on
which
i
was
extremely
sensitive
he
would
ask
about
my
husband
next
i
thought
and
if
i
answered
him
truly
what
would
he
think
of
me
i
told
him
i
had
two
children
one
in
new
york
the
other
at
the
south
he
asked
some
further
questions
and
i
frankly
told
him
some
of
the
most
important
events
of
my
life
it
was
painful
for
me
to
do
it
but
i
would
not
deceive
him
if
he
was
desirous
of
being
my
friend
i
thought
he
ought
to
know
how
far
i
was
worthy
of
it
excuse
me
if
i
have
tried
your
feelings
said
he
i
did
not
question
you
from
idle
curiosity
i
wanted
to
understand
your
situation
in
order
to
know
whether
i
could
be
of
any
service
to
you
or
your
little
girl
your
answers
do
you
credit
but
do
answer
every
body
so
openly
it
might
give
some
heartless
people
a
pretext
for
treating
you
with
contempt
that
word
burned
me
like
coals
of
fire
i
replied
god
alone
knows
how
i
have
suffered
and
he
i
trust
will
forgive
me
if
i
am
permitted
to
have
my
children
i
intend
to
be
a
good
mother
and
to
live
in
such
a
manner
that
people
can
not
treat
me
with
contempt
i
respect
your
sentiments
said
he
place
your
trust
in
god
and
be
governed
by
good
principles
and
you
will
not
fail
to
find
friends
when
we
reached
home
i
went
to
my
room
glad
to
shut
out
the
world
for
a
while
the
words
he
had
spoken
made
an
indelible
impression
upon
me
they
brought
up
great
shadows
from
the
mournful
past
in
the
midst
of
my
meditations
i
was
startled
by
a
knock
at
the
door
durham
entered
her
face
all
beaming
with
kindness
to
say
that
there
was
an
friend
down
stairs
who
would
like
to
see
me
i
overcame
my
dread
of
encountering
strangers
and
went
with
her
many
questions
were
asked
concerning
my
experiences
and
my
escape
from
slavery
but
i
observed
how
careful
they
all
were
not
to
say
any
thing
that
might
wound
my
feelings
how
gratifying
this
was
can
be
fully
understood
only
by
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
be
treated
as
if
they
were
not
included
within
the
pale
of
human
beings
the
friend
had
come
to
inquire
into
my
plans
and
to
offer
assistance
if
needed
fanny
was
comfortably
established
for
the
present
with
a
friend
of
durham
the
society
agreed
to
pay
her
expenses
to
new
york
the
same
was
offered
to
me
but
i
declined
to
accept
it
telling
them
that
my
grandmother
had
given
me
sufficient
to
pay
my
expenses
to
the
end
of
my
journey
we
were
urged
to
remain
in
philadelphia
a
few
days
until
some
suitable
escort
could
be
found
for
us
i
gladly
accepted
the
proposition
for
i
had
a
dread
of
meeting
slaveholders
and
some
dread
also
of
railroads
i
had
never
entered
a
railroad
car
in
my
life
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
an
important
event
that
night
i
sought
my
pillow
with
feelings
i
had
never
carried
to
it
before
i
verily
believed
myself
to
be
a
free
woman
i
was
wakeful
for
a
long
time
and
i
had
no
sooner
fallen
asleep
than
i
was
roused
by
i
jumped
up
and
hurried
on
my
clothes
where
i
came
from
every
body
hastened
to
dress
themselves
on
such
occasions
the
white
people
thought
a
great
fire
might
be
used
as
a
good
opportunity
for
insurrection
and
that
it
was
best
to
be
in
readiness
and
the
colored
people
were
ordered
out
to
labor
in
extinguishing
the
flames
there
was
but
one
engine
in
our
town
and
colored
women
and
children
were
often
required
to
drag
it
to
the
river
edge
and
fill
it
durham
daughter
slept
in
the
same
room
with
me
and
seeing
that
she
slept
through
all
the
din
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
wake
her
what
the
matter
said
she
rubbing
her
eyes
they
screaming
fire
in
the
streets
and
the
bells
are
ringing
i
replied
what
of
that
said
she
drowsily
we
are
used
to
it
we
never
get
up
without
the
fire
is
very
near
what
good
would
it
do
i
was
quite
surprised
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
and
help
fill
the
engine
i
was
an
ignorant
child
just
beginning
to
learn
how
things
went
on
in
great
cities
at
daylight
i
heard
women
crying
fresh
fish
berries
radishes
and
various
other
things
all
this
was
new
to
me
i
dressed
myself
at
an
early
hour
and
sat
at
the
window
to
watch
that
unknown
tide
of
life
philadelphia
seemed
to
me
a
wonderfully
great
place
at
the
breakfast
table
my
idea
of
going
out
to
drag
the
engine
was
laughed
over
and
i
joined
in
the
mirth
i
went
to
see
fanny
and
found
her
so
well
contented
among
her
new
friends
that
she
was
in
no
haste
to
leave
i
was
also
very
happy
with
my
kind
hostess
she
had
had
advantages
for
education
and
was
vastly
my
superior
every
day
almost
every
hour
i
was
adding
to
my
little
stock
of
knowledge
she
took
me
out
to
see
the
city
as
much
as
she
deemed
prudent
one
day
she
took
me
to
an
artist
room
and
showed
me
the
portraits
of
some
of
her
children
i
had
never
seen
any
paintings
of
colored
people
before
and
they
seemed
to
be
beautiful
at
the
end
of
five
days
one
of
durham
friends
offered
to
accompany
us
to
new
york
the
following
morning
as
i
held
the
hand
of
my
good
hostess
in
a
parting
clasp
i
longed
to
know
whether
her
husband
had
repeated
to
her
what
i
had
told
him
i
supposed
he
had
but
she
never
made
any
allusion
to
it
i
presume
it
was
the
delicate
silence
of
womanly
sympathy
when
durham
handed
us
our
tickets
he
said
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
a
disagreeable
ride
but
i
could
not
procure
tickets
for
the
cars
supposing
i
had
not
given
him
money
enough
i
offered
more
o
no
said
he
they
could
not
be
had
for
any
money
they
do
allow
colored
people
to
go
in
the
cars
this
was
the
first
chill
to
my
enthusiasm
about
the
free
states
colored
people
were
allowed
to
ride
in
a
filthy
box
behind
white
people
at
the
south
but
there
they
were
not
required
to
pay
for
the
privilege
it
made
me
sad
to
find
how
the
north
aped
the
customs
of
slavery
we
were
stowed
away
in
a
large
rough
car
with
windows
on
each
side
too
high
for
us
to
look
out
without
standing
up
it
was
crowded
with
people
apparently
of
all
nations
there
were
plenty
of
beds
and
cradles
containing
screaming
and
kicking
babies
every
other
man
had
a
cigar
or
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
jugs
of
whiskey
were
handed
round
freely
the
fumes
of
the
whiskey
and
the
dense
tobacco
smoke
were
sickening
to
my
senses
and
my
mind
was
equally
nauseated
by
the
coarse
jokes
and
ribald
songs
around
me
it
was
a
very
disagreeable
ride
since
that
time
there
has
been
some
improvement
in
these
matters
xxxii
the
meeting
of
mother
and
daughter
when
we
arrived
in
new
york
i
was
half
crazed
by
the
crowd
of
coachmen
calling
out
carriage
we
bargained
with
one
to
take
us
to
sullivan
street
for
twelve
shillings
a
burly
irishman
stepped
up
and
said
i
tak
ye
for
sax
shillings
the
reduction
of
half
the
price
was
an
object
to
us
and
we
asked
if
he
could
take
us
right
away
troth
an
i
will
ladies
he
replied
i
noticed
that
the
hackmen
smiled
at
each
other
and
i
inquired
whether
his
conveyance
was
decent
yes
it
dacent
it
is
marm
devil
a
bit
would
i
be
after
takin
ladies
in
a
cab
that
was
not
dacent
we
gave
him
our
checks
he
went
for
the
baggage
and
soon
reappeared
saying
this
way
if
you
plase
ladies
we
followed
and
found
our
trunks
on
a
truck
and
we
were
invited
to
take
our
seats
on
them
we
told
him
that
was
not
what
we
bargained
for
and
he
must
take
the
trunks
off
he
swore
they
should
not
be
touched
till
we
had
paid
him
six
shillings
in
our
situation
it
was
not
prudent
to
attract
attention
and
i
was
about
to
pay
him
what
he
required
when
a
man
near
by
shook
his
head
for
me
not
to
do
it
after
a
great
ado
we
got
rid
of
the
irishman
and
had
our
trunks
fastened
on
a
hack
we
had
been
recommended
to
a
in
sullivan
street
and
thither
we
drove
there
fanny
and
i
separated
the
society
provided
a
home
for
her
and
i
afterwards
heard
of
her
in
prosperous
circumstances
i
sent
for
an
old
friend
from
my
part
of
the
country
who
had
for
some
time
been
doing
business
in
new
york
he
came
immediately
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
go
to
my
daughter
and
asked
him
to
aid
me
in
procuring
an
interview
i
cautioned
him
not
to
let
it
be
known
to
the
family
that
i
had
just
arrived
from
the
south
because
they
supposed
i
had
been
at
the
north
seven
years
he
told
me
there
was
a
colored
woman
in
brooklyn
who
came
from
the
same
town
i
did
and
i
had
better
go
to
her
house
and
have
my
daughter
meet
me
there
i
accepted
the
proposition
thankfully
and
he
agreed
to
escort
me
to
brooklyn
we
crossed
fulton
ferry
went
up
myrtle
avenue
and
stopped
at
the
house
he
designated
i
was
just
about
to
enter
when
two
girls
passed
my
friend
called
my
attention
to
them
i
turned
and
recognized
in
the
eldest
sarah
the
daughter
of
a
woman
who
used
to
live
with
my
grandmother
but
who
had
left
the
south
years
ago
surprised
and
rejoiced
at
this
unexpected
meeting
i
threw
my
arms
round
her
and
inquired
concerning
her
mother
you
take
no
notice
of
the
other
girl
said
my
friend
i
turned
and
there
stood
my
ellen
i
pressed
her
to
my
heart
then
held
her
away
from
me
to
take
a
look
at
her
she
had
changed
a
good
deal
in
the
two
years
since
i
parted
from
her
signs
of
neglect
could
be
discerned
by
eyes
less
observing
than
a
mother
my
friend
invited
us
all
to
go
into
the
house
but
ellen
said
she
had
been
sent
of
an
errand
which
she
would
do
as
quickly
as
possible
and
go
home
and
ask
hobbs
to
let
her
come
and
see
me
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
send
for
her
the
next
day
her
companion
sarah
hastened
to
tell
her
mother
of
my
arrival
when
i
entered
the
house
i
found
the
mistress
of
it
absent
and
i
waited
for
her
return
before
i
saw
her
i
heard
her
saying
where
is
linda
brent
i
used
to
know
her
father
and
mother
soon
sarah
came
with
her
mother
so
there
was
quite
a
company
of
us
all
from
my
grandmother
neighborhood
these
friends
gathered
round
me
and
questioned
me
eagerly
they
laughed
they
cried
and
they
shouted
they
thanked
god
that
i
had
got
away
from
my
persecutors
and
was
safe
on
long
island
it
was
a
day
of
great
excitement
how
different
from
the
silent
days
i
had
passed
in
my
dreary
den
the
next
morning
was
sunday
my
first
waking
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
note
i
was
to
send
to
hobbs
the
lady
with
whom
ellen
lived
that
i
had
recently
come
into
that
vicinity
was
evident
otherwise
i
should
have
sooner
inquired
for
my
daughter
it
would
not
do
to
let
them
know
i
had
just
arrived
from
the
south
for
that
would
involve
the
suspicion
of
my
having
been
harbored
there
and
might
bring
trouble
if
not
ruin
on
several
people
i
like
a
straightforward
course
and
am
always
reluctant
to
resort
to
subterfuges
so
far
as
my
ways
have
been
crooked
i
charge
them
all
upon
slavery
it
was
that
system
of
violence
and
wrong
which
now
left
me
no
alternative
but
to
enact
a
falsehood
i
began
my
note
by
stating
that
i
had
recently
arrived
from
canada
and
was
very
desirous
to
have
my
daughter
come
to
see
me
she
came
and
brought
a
message
from
hobbs
inviting
me
to
her
house
and
assuring
me
that
i
need
not
have
any
fears
the
conversation
i
had
with
my
child
did
not
leave
my
mind
at
ease
when
i
asked
if
she
was
well
treated
she
answered
yes
but
there
was
no
heartiness
in
the
tone
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
said
it
from
an
unwillingness
to
have
me
troubled
on
her
account
before
she
left
me
she
asked
very
earnestly
mother
will
you
take
me
to
live
with
you
it
made
me
sad
to
think
that
i
could
not
give
her
a
home
till
i
went
to
work
and
earned
the
means
and
that
might
take
me
a
long
time
when
she
was
placed
with
hobbs
the
agreement
was
that
she
should
be
sent
to
school
she
had
been
there
two
years
and
was
now
nine
years
old
and
she
scarcely
knew
her
letters
there
was
no
excuse
for
this
for
there
were
good
public
schools
in
brooklyn
to
which
she
could
have
been
sent
without
expense
she
staid
with
me
till
dark
and
i
went
home
with
her
i
was
received
in
a
friendly
manner
by
the
family
and
all
agreed
in
saying
that
ellen
was
a
useful
good
girl
hobbs
looked
me
coolly
in
the
face
and
said
i
suppose
you
know
that
my
cousin
sands
has
her
to
my
eldest
daughter
she
will
make
a
nice
for
her
when
she
grows
up
i
did
not
answer
a
word
how
she
who
knew
by
experience
the
strength
of
a
mother
love
and
who
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
relation
sands
bore
to
my
children
how
she
look
me
in
the
face
while
she
thrust
such
a
dagger
into
my
heart
i
was
no
longer
surprised
that
they
had
kept
her
in
such
a
state
of
ignorance
hobbs
had
formerly
been
wealthy
but
he
had
failed
and
afterwards
obtained
a
subordinate
situation
in
the
custom
house
perhaps
they
expected
to
return
to
the
south
some
day
and
ellen
knowledge
was
quite
sufficient
for
a
slave
condition
i
was
impatient
to
go
to
work
and
earn
money
that
i
might
change
the
uncertain
position
of
my
children
sands
had
not
kept
his
promise
to
emancipate
them
i
had
also
been
deceived
about
ellen
what
security
had
i
with
regard
to
benjamin
i
felt
that
i
had
none
i
returned
to
my
friend
house
in
an
uneasy
state
of
mind
in
order
to
protect
my
children
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
own
myself
i
called
myself
free
and
sometimes
felt
so
but
i
knew
i
was
insecure
i
sat
down
that
night
and
wrote
a
civil
letter
to
flint
asking
him
to
state
the
lowest
terms
on
which
he
would
sell
me
and
as
i
belonged
by
law
to
his
daughter
i
wrote
to
her
also
making
a
similar
request
since
my
arrival
at
the
north
i
had
not
been
unmindful
of
my
dear
brother
william
i
had
made
diligent
inquiries
for
him
and
having
heard
of
him
in
boston
i
went
thither
when
i
arrived
there
i
found
he
had
gone
to
new
bedford
i
wrote
to
that
place
and
was
informed
he
had
gone
on
a
whaling
voyage
and
would
not
return
for
some
months
i
went
back
to
new
york
to
get
employment
near
ellen
i
received
an
answer
from
flint
which
gave
me
no
encouragement
he
advised
me
to
return
and
submit
myself
to
my
rightful
owners
and
then
any
request
i
might
make
would
be
granted
i
lent
this
letter
to
a
friend
who
lost
it
otherwise
i
would
present
a
copy
to
my
readers
xxxiii
a
home
found
my
greatest
anxiety
now
was
to
obtain
employment
my
health
was
greatly
improved
though
my
limbs
continued
to
trouble
me
with
swelling
whenever
i
walked
much
the
greatest
difficulty
in
my
way
was
that
those
who
employed
strangers
required
a
recommendation
and
in
my
peculiar
position
i
could
of
course
obtain
no
certificates
from
the
families
i
had
so
faithfully
served
one
day
an
acquaintance
told
me
of
a
lady
who
wanted
a
nurse
for
her
babe
and
i
immediately
applied
for
the
situation
the
lady
told
me
she
preferred
to
have
one
who
had
been
a
mother
and
accustomed
to
the
care
of
infants
i
told
her
i
had
nursed
two
babes
of
my
own
she
asked
me
many
questions
but
to
my
great
relief
did
not
require
a
recommendation
from
my
former
employers
she
told
me
she
was
an
english
woman
and
that
was
a
pleasant
circumstance
to
me
because
i
had
heard
they
had
less
prejudice
against
color
than
americans
entertained
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
try
each
other
for
a
week
the
trial
proved
satisfactory
to
both
parties
and
i
was
engaged
for
a
month
the
heavenly
father
had
been
most
merciful
to
me
in
leading
me
to
this
place
bruce
was
a
kind
and
gentle
lady
and
proved
a
true
and
sympathizing
friend
before
the
stipulated
month
expired
the
necessity
of
passing
up
and
down
stairs
frequently
caused
my
limbs
to
swell
so
painfully
that
i
became
unable
to
perform
my
duties
many
ladies
would
have
thoughtlessly
discharged
me
but
bruce
made
arrangements
to
save
me
steps
and
employed
a
physician
to
attend
upon
me
i
had
not
yet
told
her
that
i
was
a
fugitive
slave
she
noticed
that
i
was
often
sad
and
kindly
inquired
the
cause
i
spoke
of
being
separated
from
my
children
and
from
relatives
who
were
dear
to
me
but
i
did
not
mention
the
constant
feeling
of
insecurity
which
oppressed
my
spirits
i
longed
for
some
one
to
confide
it
but
i
had
been
so
deceived
by
white
people
that
i
had
lost
all
confidence
in
them
if
they
spoke
kind
words
to
me
i
thought
it
was
for
some
selfish
purpose
i
had
entered
this
family
with
the
distrustful
feelings
i
had
brought
with
me
out
of
slavery
but
ere
six
months
had
passed
i
found
that
the
gentle
deportment
of
bruce
and
the
smiles
of
her
lovely
babe
were
thawing
my
chilled
heart
my
narrow
mind
also
began
to
expand
under
the
influences
of
her
intelligent
conversation
and
the
opportunities
for
reading
which
were
gladly
allowed
me
whenever
i
had
leisure
from
my
duties
i
gradually
became
more
energetic
and
more
cheerful
the
old
feeling
of
insecurity
especially
with
regard
to
my
children
often
threw
its
dark
shadow
across
my
sunshine
bruce
offered
me
a
home
for
ellen
but
pleasant
as
it
would
have
been
i
did
not
dare
to
accept
it
for
fear
of
offending
the
hobbs
family
their
knowledge
of
my
precarious
situation
placed
me
in
their
power
and
i
felt
that
it
was
important
for
me
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
them
till
by
dint
of
labor
and
economy
i
could
make
a
home
for
my
children
i
was
far
from
feeling
satisfied
with
ellen
situation
she
was
not
well
cared
for
she
sometimes
came
to
new
york
to
visit
me
but
she
generally
brought
a
request
from
hobbs
that
i
would
buy
her
a
pair
of
shoes
or
some
article
of
clothing
this
was
accompanied
by
a
promise
of
payment
when
hobbs
salary
at
the
custom
house
became
due
but
some
how
or
other
the
never
came
thus
many
dollars
of
my
earnings
were
expended
to
keep
my
child
comfortably
clothed
that
however
was
a
slight
trouble
compared
with
the
fear
that
their
pecuniary
embarrassments
might
induce
them
to
sell
my
precious
young
daughter
i
knew
they
were
in
constant
communication
with
southerners
and
had
frequent
opportunities
to
do
it
i
have
stated
that
when
flint
put
ellen
in
jail
at
two
years
old
she
had
an
inflammation
of
the
eyes
occasioned
by
measles
this
disease
still
troubled
her
and
kind
bruce
proposed
that
she
should
come
to
new
york
for
a
while
to
be
under
the
care
of
elliott
a
well
known
oculist
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
there
was
any
thing
improper
in
a
mother
making
such
a
request
but
hobbs
was
very
angry
and
refused
to
let
her
go
situated
as
i
was
it
was
not
politic
to
insist
upon
it
i
made
no
complaint
but
i
longed
to
be
entirely
free
to
act
a
mother
part
towards
my
children
the
next
time
i
went
over
to
brooklyn
hobbs
as
if
to
apologize
for
her
anger
told
me
she
had
employed
her
own
physician
to
attend
to
ellen
eyes
and
that
she
had
refused
my
request
because
she
did
not
consider
it
safe
to
trust
her
in
new
york
i
accepted
the
explanation
in
silence
but
she
had
told
me
that
my
child
to
her
daughter
and
i
suspected
that
her
real
motive
was
a
fear
of
my
conveying
her
property
away
from
her
perhaps
i
did
her
injustice
but
my
knowledge
of
southerners
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
feel
otherwise
sweet
and
bitter
were
mixed
in
the
cup
of
my
life
and
i
was
thankful
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
entirely
bitter
i
loved
bruce
babe
when
it
laughed
and
crowed
in
my
face
and
twined
its
little
tender
arms
confidingly
about
my
neck
it
made
me
think
of
the
time
when
benny
and
ellen
were
babies
and
my
wounded
heart
was
soothed
one
bright
morning
as
i
stood
at
the
window
tossing
baby
in
my
arms
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
young
man
in
sailor
dress
who
was
closely
observing
every
house
as
he
passed
i
looked
at
him
earnestly
could
it
be
my
brother
william
it
be
he
and
yet
how
changed
i
placed
the
baby
safely
flew
down
stairs
opened
the
front
door
beckoned
to
the
sailor
and
in
less
than
a
minute
i
was
clasped
in
my
brother
arms
how
much
we
had
to
tell
each
other
how
we
laughed
and
how
we
cried
over
each
other
adventures
i
took
him
to
brooklyn
and
again
saw
him
with
ellen
the
dear
child
whom
he
had
loved
and
tended
so
carefully
while
i
was
shut
up
in
my
miserable
den
he
staid
in
new
york
a
week
his
old
feelings
of
affection
for
me
and
ellen
were
as
lively
as
ever
there
are
no
bonds
so
strong
as
those
which
are
formed
by
suffering
together
xxxiv
the
old
enemy
again
my
young
mistress
miss
emily
flint
did
not
return
any
answer
to
my
letter
requesting
her
to
consent
to
my
being
sold
but
after
a
while
i
received
a
reply
which
purported
to
be
written
by
her
younger
brother
in
order
rightly
to
enjoy
the
contents
of
this
letter
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
flint
family
supposed
i
had
been
at
the
north
many
years
they
had
no
idea
that
i
knew
of
the
doctor
three
excursions
to
new
york
in
search
of
me
that
i
had
heard
his
voice
when
he
came
to
borrow
five
hundred
dollars
for
that
purpose
and
that
i
had
seen
him
pass
on
his
way
to
the
steamboat
neither
were
they
aware
that
all
the
particulars
of
aunt
death
and
burial
were
conveyed
to
me
at
the
time
they
occurred
i
have
kept
the
letter
of
which
i
herewith
subjoin
a
copy
your
letter
to
sister
was
received
a
few
days
ago
i
gather
from
it
that
you
are
desirous
of
returning
to
your
native
place
among
your
friends
and
relatives
we
were
all
gratified
with
the
contents
of
your
letter
and
let
me
assure
you
that
if
any
members
of
the
family
have
had
any
feeling
of
resentment
towards
you
they
feel
it
no
longer
we
all
sympathize
with
you
in
your
unfortunate
condition
and
are
ready
to
do
all
in
our
power
to
make
you
contented
and
happy
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
return
home
as
a
free
person
if
you
were
purchased
by
your
grandmother
it
is
doubtful
whether
you
would
be
permitted
to
remain
although
it
would
be
lawful
for
you
to
do
so
if
a
servant
should
be
allowed
to
purchase
herself
after
absenting
herself
so
long
from
her
owners
and
return
free
it
would
have
an
injurious
effect
from
your
letter
i
think
your
situation
must
be
hard
and
uncomfortable
come
home
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
be
reinstated
in
our
affections
we
would
receive
you
with
open
arms
and
tears
of
joy
you
need
not
apprehend
any
unkind
treatment
as
we
have
not
put
ourselves
to
any
trouble
or
expense
to
get
you
had
we
done
so
perhaps
we
should
feel
otherwise
you
know
my
sister
was
always
attached
to
you
and
that
you
were
never
treated
as
a
slave
you
were
never
put
to
hard
work
nor
exposed
to
field
labor
on
the
contrary
you
were
taken
into
the
house
and
treated
as
one
of
us
and
almost
as
free
and
we
at
least
felt
that
you
were
above
disgracing
yourself
by
running
away
believing
you
may
be
induced
to
come
home
voluntarily
has
induced
me
to
write
for
my
sister
the
family
will
be
rejoiced
to
see
you
and
your
poor
old
grandmother
expressed
a
great
desire
to
have
you
come
when
she
heard
your
letter
read
in
her
old
age
she
needs
the
consolation
of
having
her
children
round
her
doubtless
you
have
heard
of
the
death
of
your
aunt
she
was
a
faithful
servant
and
a
faithful
member
of
the
episcopal
church
in
her
christian
life
she
taught
us
how
to
live
and
o
too
high
the
price
of
knowledge
she
taught
us
how
to
die
could
you
have
seen
us
round
her
death
bed
with
her
mother
all
mingling
our
tears
in
one
common
stream
you
would
have
thought
the
same
heartfelt
tie
existed
between
a
master
and
his
servant
as
between
a
mother
and
her
child
but
this
subject
is
too
painful
to
dwell
upon
i
must
bring
my
letter
to
a
close
if
you
are
contented
to
stay
away
from
your
old
grandmother
your
child
and
the
friends
who
love
you
stay
where
you
are
we
shall
never
trouble
ourselves
to
apprehend
you
but
should
you
prefer
to
come
home
we
will
do
all
that
we
can
to
make
you
happy
if
you
do
not
wish
to
remain
in
the
family
i
know
that
father
by
our
persuasion
will
be
induced
to
let
you
be
purchased
by
any
person
you
may
choose
in
our
community
you
will
please
answer
this
as
soon
as
possible
and
let
us
know
your
decision
sister
sends
much
love
to
you
in
the
mean
time
believe
me
your
sincere
friend
and
well
wisher
this
letter
was
signed
by
emily
brother
who
was
as
yet
a
mere
lad
i
knew
by
the
style
that
it
was
not
written
by
a
person
of
his
age
and
though
the
writing
was
disguised
i
had
been
made
too
unhappy
by
it
in
former
years
not
to
recognize
at
once
the
hand
of
flint
o
the
hypocrisy
of
slaveholders
did
the
old
fox
suppose
i
was
goose
enough
to
go
into
such
a
trap
verily
he
relied
too
much
on
the
stupidity
of
the
african
race
i
did
not
return
the
family
of
flints
any
thanks
for
their
cordial
invitation
a
remissness
for
which
i
was
no
doubt
charged
with
base
ingratitude
not
long
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
one
of
my
friends
at
the
south
informing
me
that
flint
was
about
to
visit
the
north
the
letter
had
been
delayed
and
i
supposed
he
might
be
already
on
the
way
bruce
did
not
know
i
was
a
fugitive
i
told
her
that
important
business
called
me
to
boston
where
my
brother
then
was
and
asked
permission
to
bring
a
friend
to
supply
my
place
as
nurse
for
a
fortnight
i
started
on
my
journey
immediately
and
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
wrote
to
my
grandmother
that
if
benny
came
he
must
be
sent
to
boston
i
knew
she
was
only
waiting
for
a
good
chance
to
send
him
north
and
fortunately
she
had
the
legal
power
to
do
so
without
asking
leave
of
any
body
she
was
a
free
woman
and
when
my
children
were
purchased
sands
preferred
to
have
the
bill
of
sale
drawn
up
in
her
name
it
was
conjectured
that
he
advanced
the
money
but
it
was
not
known
at
the
south
a
gentleman
may
have
a
shoal
of
colored
children
without
any
disgrace
but
if
he
is
known
to
purchase
them
with
the
view
of
setting
them
free
the
example
is
thought
to
be
dangerous
to
their
peculiar
institution
and
he
becomes
unpopular
there
was
a
good
opportunity
to
send
benny
in
a
vessel
coming
directly
to
new
york
he
was
put
on
board
with
a
letter
to
a
friend
who
was
requested
to
see
him
off
to
boston
early
one
morning
there
was
a
loud
rap
at
my
door
and
in
rushed
benjamin
all
out
of
breath
o
mother
he
exclaimed
here
i
am
i
run
all
the
way
and
i
come
all
alone
how
do
o
reader
can
you
imagine
my
joy
no
you
can
not
unless
you
have
been
a
slave
mother
benjamin
rattled
away
as
fast
as
his
tongue
could
go
mother
why
do
you
bring
ellen
here
i
went
over
to
brooklyn
to
see
her
and
she
felt
very
bad
when
i
bid
her
good
by
she
said
ben
i
wish
i
was
going
too
i
thought
she
know
ever
so
much
but
she
do
know
so
much
as
i
do
for
i
can
read
and
she
ca
and
mother
i
lost
all
my
clothes
coming
what
can
i
do
to
get
some
more
i
free
boys
can
get
along
here
at
the
north
as
well
as
white
boys
i
did
not
like
to
tell
the
sanguine
happy
little
fellow
how
much
he
was
mistaken
i
took
him
to
a
tailor
and
procured
a
change
of
clothes
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
mutual
asking
and
answering
of
questions
with
the
wish
constantly
repeated
that
the
good
old
grandmother
was
with
us
and
frequent
injunctions
from
benny
to
write
to
her
immediately
and
be
sure
to
tell
her
every
thing
about
his
voyage
and
his
journey
to
boston
flint
made
his
visit
to
new
york
and
made
every
exertion
to
call
upon
me
and
invite
me
to
return
with
him
but
not
being
able
to
ascertain
where
i
was
his
hospitable
intentions
were
frustrated
and
the
affectionate
family
who
were
waiting
for
me
with
open
arms
were
doomed
to
disappointment
as
soon
as
i
knew
he
was
safely
at
home
i
placed
benjamin
in
the
care
of
my
brother
william
and
returned
to
bruce
there
i
remained
through
the
winter
and
spring
endeavoring
to
perform
my
duties
faithfully
and
finding
a
good
degree
of
happiness
in
the
attractions
of
baby
mary
the
considerate
kindness
of
her
excellent
mother
and
occasional
interviews
with
my
darling
daughter
but
when
summer
came
the
old
feeling
of
insecurity
haunted
me
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
take
little
mary
out
daily
for
exercise
and
fresh
air
and
the
city
was
swarming
with
southerners
some
of
whom
might
recognize
me
hot
weather
brings
out
snakes
and
slaveholders
and
i
like
one
class
of
the
venomous
creatures
as
little
as
i
do
the
other
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
be
free
to
so
xxxv
prejudice
against
color
it
was
a
relief
to
my
mind
to
see
preparations
for
leaving
the
city
we
went
to
albany
in
the
steamboat
knickerbocker
when
the
gong
sounded
for
tea
bruce
said
linda
it
is
late
and
you
and
baby
had
better
come
to
the
table
with
me
i
replied
i
know
it
is
time
baby
had
her
supper
but
i
had
rather
not
go
with
you
if
you
please
i
am
afraid
of
being
insulted
o
no
not
if
you
are
with
she
said
i
saw
several
white
nurses
go
with
their
ladies
and
i
ventured
to
do
the
same
we
were
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
table
i
was
no
sooner
seated
than
a
gruff
voice
said
get
up
you
know
you
are
not
allowed
to
sit
here
i
looked
up
and
to
my
astonishment
and
indignation
saw
that
the
speaker
was
a
colored
man
if
his
office
required
him
to
enforce
the
of
the
boat
he
might
at
least
have
done
it
politely
i
replied
i
shall
not
get
up
unless
the
captain
comes
and
takes
me
up
no
cup
of
tea
was
offered
me
but
bruce
handed
me
hers
and
called
for
another
i
looked
to
see
whether
the
other
nurses
were
treated
in
a
similar
manner
they
were
all
properly
waited
on
next
morning
when
we
stopped
at
troy
for
breakfast
every
body
was
making
a
rush
for
the
table
bruce
said
take
my
arm
linda
and
we
go
in
together
the
landlord
heard
her
and
said
madam
will
you
allow
your
nurse
and
baby
to
take
breakfast
with
my
family
i
knew
this
was
to
be
attributed
to
my
complexion
but
he
spoke
courteously
and
therefore
i
did
not
mind
it
at
saratoga
we
found
the
united
states
hotel
crowded
and
bruce
took
one
of
the
cottages
belonging
to
the
hotel
i
had
thought
with
gladness
of
going
to
the
quiet
of
the
country
where
i
should
meet
few
people
but
here
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
swarm
of
southerners
i
looked
round
me
with
fear
and
trembling
dreading
to
see
some
one
who
would
recognize
me
i
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
we
were
to
stay
but
a
short
time
we
soon
returned
to
new
york
to
make
arrangements
for
spending
the
remainder
of
the
summer
at
rockaway
while
the
laundress
was
putting
the
clothes
in
order
i
took
an
opportunity
to
go
over
to
brooklyn
to
see
ellen
i
met
her
going
to
a
grocery
store
and
the
first
words
she
said
were
o
mother
do
go
to
hobbs
her
brother
thorne
has
come
from
the
south
and
may
be
he
tell
where
you
are
i
accepted
the
warning
i
told
her
i
was
going
away
with
bruce
the
next
day
and
would
try
to
see
her
when
i
came
back
being
in
servitude
to
the
race
i
was
not
put
into
a
jim
crow
car
on
our
way
to
rockaway
neither
was
i
invited
to
ride
through
the
streets
on
the
top
of
trunks
in
a
truck
but
every
where
i
found
the
same
manifestations
of
that
cruel
prejudice
which
so
discourages
the
feelings
and
represses
the
energies
of
the
colored
people
we
reached
rockaway
before
dark
and
put
up
at
the
pavilion
a
large
hotel
beautifully
situated
by
the
a
great
resort
of
the
fashionable
world
thirty
or
forty
nurses
were
there
of
a
great
variety
of
nations
some
of
the
ladies
had
colored
and
coachmen
but
i
was
the
only
nurse
tinged
with
the
blood
of
africa
when
the
tea
bell
rang
i
took
little
mary
and
followed
the
other
nurses
supper
was
served
in
a
long
hall
a
young
man
who
had
the
ordering
of
things
took
the
circuit
of
the
table
two
or
three
times
and
finally
pointed
me
to
a
seat
at
the
lower
end
of
it
as
there
was
but
one
chair
i
sat
down
and
took
the
child
in
my
lap
whereupon
the
young
man
came
to
me
and
said
in
the
blandest
manner
possible
will
you
please
to
seat
the
little
girl
in
the
chair
and
stand
behind
it
and
feed
her
after
they
have
done
you
will
be
shown
to
the
kitchen
where
you
will
have
a
good
supper
this
was
the
climax
i
found
it
hard
to
preserve
my
when
i
looked
round
and
saw
women
who
were
nurses
as
i
was
and
only
one
shade
lighter
in
complexion
eyeing
me
with
a
defiant
look
as
if
my
presence
were
a
contamination
however
i
said
nothing
i
quietly
took
the
child
in
my
arms
went
to
our
room
and
refused
to
go
to
the
table
again
bruce
ordered
meals
to
be
sent
to
the
room
for
little
mary
and
i
this
answered
for
a
few
days
but
the
waiters
of
the
establishment
were
white
and
they
soon
began
to
complain
saying
they
were
not
hired
to
wait
on
negroes
the
landlord
requested
bruce
to
send
me
down
to
my
meals
because
his
servants
rebelled
against
bringing
them
up
and
the
colored
servants
of
other
boarders
were
dissatisfied
because
all
were
not
treated
alike
my
answer
was
that
the
colored
servants
ought
to
be
dissatisfied
with
for
not
having
too
much
to
submit
to
such
treatment
that
there
was
no
difference
in
the
price
of
board
for
colored
and
white
servants
and
there
was
no
justification
for
difference
of
treatment
i
staid
a
month
after
this
and
finding
i
was
resolved
to
stand
up
for
my
rights
they
concluded
to
treat
me
well
let
every
colored
man
and
woman
do
this
and
eventually
we
shall
cease
to
be
trampled
under
foot
by
our
oppressors
xxxvi
the
hairbreadth
escape
after
we
returned
to
new
york
i
took
the
earliest
opportunity
to
go
and
see
ellen
i
asked
to
have
her
called
down
stairs
for
i
supposed
hobbs
southern
brother
might
still
be
there
and
i
was
desirous
to
avoid
seeing
him
if
possible
but
hobbs
came
to
the
kitchen
and
insisted
on
my
going
up
stairs
my
brother
wants
to
see
you
said
she
and
he
is
sorry
you
seem
to
shun
him
he
knows
you
are
living
in
new
york
he
told
me
to
say
to
you
that
he
owes
thanks
to
good
old
aunt
martha
for
too
many
little
acts
of
kindness
for
him
to
be
base
enough
to
betray
her
grandchild
this
thorne
had
become
poor
and
reckless
long
before
he
left
the
south
and
such
persons
had
much
rather
go
to
one
of
the
faithful
old
slaves
to
borrow
a
dollar
or
get
a
good
dinner
than
to
go
to
one
whom
they
consider
an
equal
it
was
such
acts
of
kindness
as
these
for
which
he
professed
to
feel
grateful
to
my
grandmother
i
wished
he
had
kept
at
a
distance
but
as
he
was
here
and
knew
where
i
was
i
concluded
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
trying
to
avoid
him
on
the
contrary
it
might
be
the
means
of
exciting
his
ill
will
i
followed
his
sister
up
stairs
he
met
me
in
a
very
friendly
manner
congratulated
me
on
my
escape
from
slavery
and
hoped
i
had
a
good
place
where
i
felt
happy
i
continued
to
visit
ellen
as
often
as
i
could
she
good
thoughtful
child
never
forgot
my
hazardous
situation
but
always
kept
a
vigilant
lookout
for
my
safety
she
never
made
any
complaint
about
her
own
inconveniences
and
troubles
but
a
mother
observing
eye
easily
perceived
that
she
was
not
happy
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
my
visits
i
found
her
unusually
serious
when
i
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
said
nothing
was
the
matter
but
i
insisted
upon
knowing
what
made
her
look
so
very
grave
finally
i
ascertained
that
she
felt
troubled
about
the
dissipation
that
was
continually
going
on
in
the
house
she
was
sent
to
the
store
very
often
for
rum
and
brandy
and
she
felt
ashamed
to
ask
for
it
so
often
and
hobbs
and
thorne
drank
a
great
deal
and
their
hands
trembled
so
that
they
had
to
call
her
to
pour
out
the
liquor
for
them
but
for
all
that
said
she
hobbs
is
good
to
me
and
i
ca
help
liking
him
i
feel
sorry
for
him
i
tried
to
comfort
her
by
telling
her
that
i
had
laid
up
a
hundred
dollars
and
that
before
long
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
her
and
benjamin
a
home
and
send
them
to
school
she
was
always
desirous
not
to
add
to
my
troubles
more
than
she
could
help
and
i
did
not
discover
till
years
afterwards
that
thorne
intemperance
was
not
the
only
annoyance
she
suffered
from
him
though
he
professed
too
much
gratitude
to
my
grandmother
to
injure
any
of
her
descendants
he
had
poured
vile
language
into
the
ears
of
her
innocent
i
usually
went
to
brooklyn
to
spend
sunday
afternoon
one
sunday
i
found
ellen
anxiously
waiting
for
me
near
the
house
o
mother
said
she
been
waiting
for
you
this
long
time
i
afraid
thorne
has
written
to
tell
flint
where
you
are
make
haste
and
come
in
hobbs
will
tell
you
all
about
it
the
story
was
soon
told
while
the
children
were
playing
in
the
arbor
the
day
before
thorne
came
out
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
which
he
tore
up
and
scattered
about
ellen
was
sweeping
the
yard
at
the
time
and
having
her
mind
full
of
suspicions
of
him
she
picked
up
the
pieces
and
carried
them
to
the
children
saying
i
wonder
who
thorne
has
been
writing
to
i
sure
i
do
know
and
do
care
replied
the
oldest
of
the
children
and
i
do
see
how
it
concerns
you
but
it
does
concern
me
replied
ellen
for
i
afraid
he
been
writing
to
the
south
about
my
mother
they
laughed
at
her
and
called
her
a
silly
thing
but
put
the
fragments
of
writing
together
in
order
to
read
them
to
her
they
were
no
sooner
arranged
than
the
little
girl
exclaimed
i
declare
ellen
i
believe
you
are
right
the
contents
of
thorne
letter
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
were
as
follows
i
have
seen
your
slave
linda
and
conversed
with
her
she
can
be
taken
very
easily
if
you
manage
prudently
there
are
enough
of
us
here
to
swear
to
her
identity
as
your
property
i
am
a
patriot
a
lover
of
my
country
and
i
do
this
as
an
act
of
justice
to
the
laws
he
concluded
by
informing
the
doctor
of
the
street
and
number
where
i
lived
the
children
carried
the
pieces
to
hobbs
who
immediately
went
to
her
room
for
an
explanation
he
was
not
to
be
found
the
servants
said
they
saw
him
go
out
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
they
supposed
he
had
gone
to
the
post
office
the
natural
inference
was
that
he
had
sent
to
flint
a
copy
of
those
fragments
when
he
returned
his
sister
accused
him
of
it
and
he
did
not
deny
the
charge
he
went
immediately
to
his
room
and
the
next
morning
he
was
missing
he
had
gone
over
to
new
york
before
any
of
the
family
were
astir
it
was
evident
that
i
had
no
time
to
lose
and
i
hastened
back
to
the
city
with
a
heavy
heart
again
i
was
to
be
torn
from
a
comfortable
home
and
all
my
plans
for
the
welfare
of
my
children
were
to
be
frustrated
by
that
demon
slavery
i
now
regretted
that
i
never
told
bruce
my
story
i
had
not
concealed
it
merely
on
account
of
being
a
fugitive
that
would
have
made
her
anxious
but
it
would
have
excited
sympathy
in
her
kind
heart
i
valued
her
good
opinion
and
i
was
afraid
of
losing
it
if
i
told
her
all
the
particulars
of
my
sad
story
but
now
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
know
how
i
was
situated
i
had
once
left
her
abruptly
without
explaining
the
reason
and
it
would
not
be
proper
to
do
it
again
i
went
home
resolved
to
tell
her
in
the
morning
but
the
sadness
of
my
face
attracted
her
attention
and
in
answer
to
her
kind
inquiries
i
poured
out
my
full
heart
to
her
before
bed
time
she
listened
with
true
womanly
sympathy
and
told
me
she
would
do
all
she
could
to
protect
me
how
my
heart
blessed
her
early
the
next
morning
judge
vanderpool
and
lawyer
hopper
were
consulted
they
said
i
had
better
leave
the
city
at
once
as
the
risk
would
be
great
if
the
case
came
to
trial
bruce
took
me
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
of
one
of
her
friends
where
she
assured
me
i
should
be
safe
until
my
brother
could
arrive
which
would
be
in
a
few
days
in
the
interval
my
thoughts
were
much
occupied
with
ellen
she
was
mine
by
birth
and
she
was
also
mine
by
southern
law
since
my
grandmother
held
the
bill
of
sale
that
made
her
so
i
did
not
feel
that
she
was
safe
unless
i
had
her
with
me
hobbs
who
felt
badly
about
her
brother
treachery
yielded
to
my
entreaties
on
condition
that
she
should
return
in
ten
days
i
avoided
making
any
promise
she
came
to
me
clad
in
very
thin
garments
all
outgrown
and
with
a
school
satchel
on
her
arm
containing
a
few
articles
it
was
late
in
october
and
i
knew
the
child
must
suffer
and
not
daring
to
go
out
in
the
streets
to
purchase
any
thing
i
took
off
my
own
flannel
skirt
and
converted
it
into
one
for
her
kind
bruce
came
to
bid
me
good
by
and
when
she
saw
that
i
had
taken
off
my
clothing
for
my
child
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
said
wait
for
me
linda
and
went
out
she
soon
returned
with
a
nice
warm
shawl
and
hood
for
ellen
truly
of
such
souls
as
hers
are
the
kingdom
of
heaven
my
brother
reached
new
york
on
wednesday
lawyer
hopper
advised
us
to
go
to
boston
by
the
stonington
route
as
there
was
less
southern
travel
in
that
direction
bruce
directed
her
servants
to
tell
all
inquirers
that
i
formerly
lived
there
but
had
gone
from
the
city
we
reached
the
steamboat
rhode
island
in
safety
that
boat
employed
colored
hands
but
i
knew
that
colored
passengers
were
not
admitted
to
the
cabin
i
was
very
desirous
for
the
seclusion
of
the
cabin
not
only
on
account
of
exposure
to
the
night
air
but
also
to
avoid
observation
lawyer
hopper
was
waiting
on
board
for
us
he
spoke
to
the
stewardess
and
asked
as
a
particular
favor
that
she
would
treat
us
well
he
said
to
me
go
and
speak
to
the
captain
yourself
by
and
by
take
your
little
girl
with
you
and
i
am
sure
that
he
will
not
let
her
sleep
on
deck
with
these
kind
words
and
a
shake
of
the
hand
he
departed
the
boat
was
soon
on
her
way
bearing
me
rapidly
from
the
friendly
home
where
i
had
hoped
to
find
security
and
rest
my
brother
had
left
me
to
purchase
the
tickets
thinking
that
i
might
have
better
success
than
he
would
when
the
stewardess
came
to
me
i
paid
what
she
asked
and
she
gave
me
three
tickets
with
clipped
corners
in
the
most
unsophisticated
manner
i
said
you
have
made
a
mistake
i
asked
you
for
cabin
tickets
i
can
not
possibly
consent
to
sleep
on
deck
with
my
little
daughter
she
assured
me
there
was
no
mistake
she
said
on
some
of
the
routes
colored
people
were
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
cabin
but
not
on
this
route
which
was
much
travelled
by
the
wealthy
i
asked
her
to
show
me
to
the
captain
office
and
she
said
she
would
after
tea
when
the
time
came
i
took
ellen
by
the
hand
and
went
to
the
captain
politely
requesting
him
to
change
our
tickets
as
we
should
be
very
uncomfortable
on
deck
he
said
it
was
contrary
to
their
custom
but
he
would
see
that
we
had
berths
below
he
would
also
try
to
obtain
comfortable
seats
for
us
in
the
cars
of
that
he
was
not
certain
but
he
would
speak
to
the
conductor
about
it
when
the
boat
arrived
i
thanked
him
and
returned
to
the
ladies
cabin
he
came
afterwards
and
told
me
that
the
conductor
of
the
cars
was
on
board
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
and
he
had
promised
to
take
care
of
us
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
receiving
so
much
kindness
i
do
know
whether
the
pleasing
face
of
my
little
girl
had
won
his
heart
or
whether
the
stewardess
inferred
from
lawyer
hopper
manner
that
i
was
a
fugitive
and
had
pleaded
with
him
in
my
behalf
when
the
boat
arrived
at
stonington
the
conductor
kept
his
promise
and
showed
us
to
seats
in
the
first
car
nearest
the
engine
he
asked
us
to
take
seats
next
the
door
but
as
he
passed
through
we
ventured
to
move
on
toward
the
other
end
of
the
car
no
incivility
was
offered
us
and
we
reached
boston
in
safety
the
day
after
my
arrival
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
my
life
i
felt
as
if
i
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bloodhounds
and
for
the
first
time
during
many
years
i
had
both
my
children
together
with
me
they
greatly
enjoyed
their
reunion
and
laughed
and
chatted
merrily
i
watched
them
with
a
swelling
heart
their
every
motion
delighted
me
i
could
not
feel
safe
in
new
york
and
i
accepted
the
offer
of
a
friend
that
we
should
share
expenses
and
keep
house
together
i
represented
to
hobbs
that
ellen
must
have
some
schooling
and
must
remain
with
me
for
that
purpose
she
felt
ashamed
of
being
unable
to
read
or
spell
at
her
age
so
instead
of
sending
her
to
school
with
benny
i
instructed
her
myself
till
she
was
fitted
to
enter
an
intermediate
school
the
winter
passed
pleasantly
while
i
was
busy
with
my
needle
and
my
children
with
their
books
xxxvii
a
visit
to
england
in
the
spring
sad
news
came
to
me
bruce
was
dead
never
again
in
this
world
should
i
see
her
gentle
face
or
hear
her
sympathizing
voice
i
had
lost
an
excellent
friend
and
little
mary
had
lost
a
tender
mother
bruce
wished
the
child
to
visit
some
of
her
mother
relatives
in
england
and
he
was
desirous
that
i
should
take
charge
of
her
the
little
motherless
one
was
accustomed
to
me
and
attached
to
me
and
i
thought
she
would
be
happier
in
my
care
than
in
that
of
a
stranger
i
could
also
earn
more
in
this
way
than
i
could
by
my
needle
so
i
put
benny
to
a
trade
and
left
ellen
to
remain
in
the
house
with
my
friend
and
go
to
school
we
sailed
from
new
york
and
arrived
in
liverpool
after
a
pleasant
voyage
of
twelve
days
we
proceeded
directly
to
london
and
took
lodgings
at
the
adelaide
hotel
the
supper
seemed
to
me
less
luxurious
than
those
i
had
seen
in
american
hotels
but
my
situation
was
indescribably
more
pleasant
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
in
a
place
where
i
was
treated
according
to
my
deportment
without
reference
to
my
complexion
i
felt
as
if
a
great
millstone
had
been
lifted
from
my
breast
ensconced
in
a
pleasant
room
with
my
dear
little
charge
i
laid
my
head
on
my
pillow
for
the
first
time
with
the
delightful
consciousness
of
pure
unadulterated
freedom
as
i
had
constant
care
of
the
child
i
had
little
opportunity
to
see
the
wonders
of
that
great
city
but
i
watched
the
tide
of
life
that
flowed
through
the
streets
and
found
it
a
strange
contrast
to
the
stagnation
in
our
southern
towns
bruce
took
his
little
daughter
to
spend
some
days
with
friends
in
oxford
crescent
and
of
course
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
accompany
her
i
had
heard
much
of
the
systematic
method
of
english
education
and
i
was
very
desirous
that
my
dear
mary
should
steer
straight
in
the
midst
of
so
much
propriety
i
closely
observed
her
little
playmates
and
their
nurses
being
ready
to
take
any
lessons
in
the
science
of
good
management
the
children
were
more
rosy
than
american
children
but
i
did
not
see
that
they
differed
materially
in
other
respects
they
were
like
all
children
sometimes
docile
and
sometimes
wayward
we
next
went
to
steventon
in
berkshire
it
was
a
small
town
said
to
be
the
poorest
in
the
county
i
saw
men
working
in
the
fields
for
six
shillings
and
seven
shillings
a
week
and
women
for
sixpence
and
sevenpence
a
day
out
of
which
they
boarded
themselves
of
course
they
lived
in
the
most
primitive
manner
it
could
not
be
otherwise
where
a
woman
wages
for
an
entire
day
were
not
sufficient
to
buy
a
pound
of
meat
they
paid
very
low
rents
and
their
clothes
were
made
of
the
cheapest
fabrics
though
much
better
than
could
have
been
procured
in
the
united
states
for
the
same
money
i
had
heard
much
about
the
oppression
of
the
poor
in
europe
the
people
i
saw
around
me
were
many
of
them
among
the
poorest
poor
but
when
i
visited
them
in
their
little
thatched
cottages
i
felt
that
the
condition
of
even
the
meanest
and
most
ignorant
among
them
was
vastly
superior
to
the
condition
of
the
most
favored
slaves
in
america
they
labored
hard
but
they
were
not
ordered
out
to
toil
while
the
stars
were
in
the
sky
and
driven
and
slashed
by
an
overseer
through
heat
and
cold
till
the
stars
shone
out
again
their
homes
were
very
humble
but
they
were
protected
by
law
no
insolent
patrols
could
come
in
the
dead
of
night
and
flog
them
at
their
pleasure
the
father
when
he
closed
his
cottage
door
felt
safe
with
his
family
around
him
no
master
or
overseer
could
come
and
take
from
him
his
wife
or
his
daughter
they
must
separate
to
earn
their
living
but
the
parents
knew
where
their
children
were
going
and
could
communicate
with
them
by
letters
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
were
too
sacred
for
the
richest
noble
in
the
land
to
violate
with
impunity
much
was
being
done
to
enlighten
these
poor
people
schools
were
established
among
them
and
benevolent
societies
were
active
in
efforts
to
ameliorate
their
condition
there
was
no
law
forbidding
them
to
learn
to
read
and
write
and
if
they
helped
each
other
in
spelling
out
the
bible
they
were
in
no
danger
of
lashes
as
was
the
case
with
myself
and
poor
pious
old
uncle
fred
i
repeat
that
the
most
ignorant
and
the
most
destitute
of
these
peasants
was
a
thousand
fold
better
off
than
the
most
pampered
american
slave
i
do
not
deny
that
the
poor
are
oppressed
in
europe
i
am
not
disposed
to
paint
their
condition
so
as
the
hon
miss
murray
paints
the
condition
of
the
slaves
in
the
united
states
a
small
portion
of
experience
would
enable
her
to
read
her
own
pages
with
anointed
eyes
if
she
were
to
lay
aside
her
title
and
instead
of
visiting
among
the
fashionable
become
domesticated
as
a
poor
governess
on
some
plantation
in
louisiana
or
alabama
she
would
see
and
hear
things
that
would
make
her
tell
quite
a
different
story
my
visit
to
england
is
a
memorable
event
in
my
life
from
the
fact
of
my
having
there
received
strong
religious
impressions
the
contemptuous
manner
in
which
the
communion
had
been
administered
to
colored
people
in
my
native
place
the
church
membership
of
flint
and
others
like
him
and
the
buying
and
selling
of
slaves
by
professed
ministers
of
the
gospel
had
given
me
a
prejudice
against
the
episcopal
church
the
whole
service
seemed
to
me
a
mockery
and
a
sham
but
my
home
in
steventon
was
in
the
family
of
a
clergyman
who
was
a
true
disciple
of
jesus
the
beauty
of
his
daily
life
inspired
me
with
faith
in
the
genuineness
of
christian
professions
grace
entered
my
heart
and
i
knelt
at
the
communion
table
i
trust
in
true
humility
of
soul
i
remained
abroad
ten
months
which
was
much
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
during
all
that
time
i
never
saw
the
slightest
symptom
of
prejudice
against
color
indeed
i
entirely
forgot
it
till
the
time
came
for
us
to
return
to
america
xxxviii
renewed
invitations
to
go
south
we
had
a
tedious
winter
passage
and
from
the
distance
spectres
seemed
to
rise
up
on
the
shores
of
the
united
states
it
is
a
sad
feeling
to
be
afraid
of
one
native
country
we
arrived
in
new
york
safely
and
i
hastened
to
boston
to
look
after
my
children
i
found
ellen
well
and
improving
at
her
school
but
benny
was
not
there
to
welcome
me
he
had
been
left
at
a
good
place
to
learn
a
trade
and
for
several
months
every
thing
worked
well
he
was
liked
by
the
master
and
was
a
favorite
with
his
but
one
day
they
accidentally
discovered
a
fact
they
had
never
before
suspected
that
he
was
colored
this
at
once
transformed
him
into
a
different
being
some
of
the
apprentices
were
americans
others
irish
and
it
was
offensive
to
their
dignity
to
have
a
nigger
among
them
after
they
had
been
told
that
he
a
nigger
they
began
by
treating
him
with
silent
scorn
and
finding
that
he
returned
the
same
they
resorted
to
insults
and
abuse
he
was
too
spirited
a
boy
to
stand
that
and
he
went
off
being
desirous
to
do
something
to
support
himself
and
having
no
one
to
advise
him
he
shipped
for
a
whaling
voyage
when
i
received
these
tidings
i
shed
many
tears
and
bitterly
reproached
myself
for
having
left
him
so
long
but
i
had
done
it
for
the
best
and
now
all
i
could
do
was
to
pray
to
the
heavenly
father
to
guide
and
protect
him
not
long
after
my
return
i
received
the
following
letter
from
miss
emily
flint
now
mrs
dodge
in
this
you
will
recognize
the
hand
of
your
friend
and
mistress
having
heard
that
you
had
gone
with
a
family
to
europe
i
have
waited
to
hear
of
your
return
to
write
to
you
i
should
have
answered
the
letter
you
wrote
to
me
long
since
but
as
i
could
not
then
act
independently
of
my
father
i
knew
there
could
be
nothing
done
satisfactory
to
you
there
were
persons
here
who
were
willing
to
buy
you
and
run
the
risk
of
getting
you
to
this
i
would
not
consent
i
have
always
been
attached
to
you
and
would
not
like
to
see
you
the
slave
of
another
or
have
unkind
treatment
i
am
married
now
and
can
protect
you
my
husband
expects
to
move
to
virginia
this
spring
where
we
think
of
settling
i
am
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
and
live
with
me
if
you
are
not
willing
to
come
you
may
purchase
yourself
but
i
should
prefer
having
you
live
with
me
if
you
come
you
may
if
you
like
spend
a
month
with
your
grandmother
and
friends
then
come
to
me
in
norfolk
virginia
think
this
over
and
write
as
soon
as
possible
and
let
me
know
the
conclusion
hoping
that
your
children
are
well
i
remain
your
friend
and
mistress
of
course
i
did
not
write
to
return
thanks
for
this
cordial
invitation
i
felt
insulted
to
be
thought
stupid
enough
to
be
caught
by
such
professions
come
up
into
my
parlor
said
the
spider
to
the
fly
tis
the
prettiest
little
parlor
that
ever
you
did
spy
it
was
plain
that
flint
family
were
apprised
of
my
movements
since
they
knew
of
my
voyage
to
europe
i
expected
to
have
further
trouble
from
them
but
having
eluded
them
thus
far
i
hoped
to
be
as
successful
in
future
the
money
i
had
earned
i
was
desirous
to
devote
to
the
education
of
my
children
and
to
secure
a
home
for
them
it
seemed
not
only
hard
but
unjust
to
pay
for
myself
i
could
not
possibly
regard
myself
as
a
piece
of
property
moreover
i
had
worked
many
years
without
wages
and
during
that
time
had
been
obliged
to
depend
on
my
grandmother
for
many
comforts
in
food
and
clothing
my
children
certainly
belonged
to
me
but
though
flint
had
incurred
no
expense
for
their
support
he
had
received
a
large
sum
of
money
for
them
i
knew
the
law
would
decide
that
i
was
his
property
and
would
probably
still
give
his
daughter
a
claim
to
my
children
but
i
regarded
such
laws
as
the
regulations
of
robbers
who
had
no
rights
that
i
was
bound
to
respect
the
fugitive
slave
law
had
not
then
passed
the
judges
of
massachusetts
had
not
then
stooped
under
chains
to
enter
her
courts
of
justice
so
called
i
knew
my
old
master
was
rather
skittish
of
massachusetts
i
relied
on
her
love
of
freedom
and
felt
safe
on
her
soil
i
am
now
aware
that
i
honored
the
old
commonwealth
beyond
her
deserts
xxxix
the
confession
for
two
years
my
daughter
and
i
supported
ourselves
comfortably
in
boston
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
brother
william
offered
to
send
ellen
to
a
boarding
school
it
required
a
great
effort
for
me
to
consent
to
part
with
her
for
i
had
few
near
ties
and
it
was
her
presence
that
made
my
two
little
rooms
seem
but
my
judgment
prevailed
over
my
selfish
feelings
i
made
preparations
for
her
departure
during
the
two
years
we
had
lived
together
i
had
often
resolved
to
tell
her
something
about
her
father
but
i
had
never
been
able
to
muster
sufficient
courage
i
had
a
shrinking
dread
of
diminishing
my
child
love
i
knew
she
must
have
curiosity
on
the
subject
but
she
had
never
asked
a
question
she
was
always
very
careful
not
to
say
any
thing
to
remind
me
of
my
troubles
now
that
she
was
going
from
me
i
thought
if
i
should
die
before
she
returned
she
might
hear
my
story
from
some
one
who
did
not
understand
the
palliating
circumstances
and
that
if
she
were
entirely
ignorant
on
the
subject
her
sensitive
nature
might
receive
a
rude
shock
when
we
retired
for
the
night
she
said
mother
it
is
very
hard
to
leave
you
alone
i
am
almost
sorry
i
am
going
though
i
do
want
to
improve
myself
but
you
will
write
to
me
often
wo
you
mother
i
did
not
throw
my
arms
round
her
i
did
not
answer
her
but
in
a
calm
solemn
way
for
it
cost
me
great
effort
i
said
listen
to
me
ellen
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
recounted
my
early
sufferings
in
slavery
and
told
her
how
nearly
they
had
crushed
me
i
began
to
tell
her
how
they
had
driven
me
into
a
great
sin
when
she
clasped
me
in
her
arms
and
exclaimed
o
do
mother
please
do
tell
me
any
more
i
said
but
my
child
i
want
you
to
know
about
your
father
i
know
all
about
it
mother
she
replied
i
am
nothing
to
my
father
and
he
is
nothing
to
me
all
my
love
is
for
you
i
was
with
him
five
months
in
washington
and
he
never
cared
for
me
he
never
spoke
to
me
as
he
did
to
his
little
fanny
i
knew
all
the
time
he
was
my
father
for
fanny
nurse
told
me
so
but
she
said
i
must
never
tell
any
body
and
i
never
did
i
used
to
wish
he
would
take
me
in
his
arms
and
kiss
me
as
he
did
fanny
or
that
he
would
sometimes
smile
at
me
as
he
did
at
her
i
thought
if
he
was
my
own
father
he
ought
to
love
me
i
was
a
little
girl
then
and
know
any
better
but
now
i
never
think
any
thing
about
my
father
all
my
love
is
for
you
she
hugged
me
closer
as
she
spoke
and
i
thanked
god
that
the
knowledge
i
had
so
much
dreaded
to
impart
had
not
diminished
the
affection
of
my
child
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
she
knew
that
portion
of
my
history
if
i
had
i
should
have
spoken
to
her
long
before
for
my
feelings
had
often
longed
to
pour
themselves
out
to
some
one
i
could
trust
but
i
loved
the
dear
girl
better
for
the
delicacy
she
had
manifested
towards
her
unfortunate
mother
the
next
morning
she
and
her
uncle
started
on
their
journey
to
the
village
in
new
york
where
she
was
to
be
placed
at
school
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
sunshine
had
gone
away
my
little
room
was
dreadfully
lonely
i
was
thankful
when
a
message
came
from
a
lady
accustomed
to
employ
me
requesting
me
to
come
and
sew
in
her
family
for
several
weeks
on
my
return
i
found
a
letter
from
brother
william
he
thought
of
opening
an
reading
room
in
rochester
and
combining
with
it
the
sale
of
some
books
and
stationery
and
he
wanted
me
to
unite
with
him
we
tried
it
but
it
was
not
successful
we
found
warm
friends
there
but
the
feeling
was
not
general
enough
to
support
such
an
establishment
i
passed
nearly
a
year
in
the
family
of
isaac
and
amy
post
practical
believers
in
the
christian
doctrine
of
human
brotherhood
they
measure
a
man
worth
by
his
character
not
by
his
complexion
the
memory
of
those
beloved
and
honored
friends
will
remain
with
me
to
my
latest
hour
xl
the
fugitive
slave
law
my
brother
being
disappointed
in
his
project
concluded
to
go
to
california
and
it
was
agreed
that
benjamin
should
go
with
him
ellen
liked
her
school
and
was
a
great
favorite
there
they
did
not
know
her
history
and
she
did
not
tell
it
because
she
had
no
desire
to
make
capital
out
of
their
sympathy
but
when
it
was
accidentally
discovered
that
her
mother
was
a
fugitive
slave
every
method
was
used
to
increase
her
advantages
and
diminish
her
expenses
i
was
alone
again
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
earning
money
and
i
preferred
that
it
should
be
among
those
who
knew
me
on
my
return
from
rochester
i
called
at
the
house
of
bruce
to
see
mary
the
darling
little
babe
that
had
thawed
my
heart
when
it
was
freezing
into
a
cheerless
distrust
of
all
my
she
was
growing
a
tall
girl
now
but
i
loved
her
always
bruce
had
married
again
and
it
was
proposed
that
i
should
become
nurse
to
a
new
infant
i
had
but
one
hesitation
and
that
was
feeling
of
insecurity
in
new
york
now
greatly
increased
by
the
passage
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
however
i
resolved
to
try
the
experiment
i
was
again
fortunate
in
my
employer
the
new
bruce
was
an
american
brought
up
under
aristocratic
influences
and
still
living
in
the
midst
of
them
but
if
she
had
any
prejudice
against
color
i
was
never
made
aware
of
it
and
as
for
the
system
of
slavery
she
had
a
most
hearty
dislike
of
it
no
sophistry
of
southerners
could
blind
her
to
its
enormity
she
was
a
person
of
excellent
principles
and
a
noble
heart
to
me
from
that
hour
to
the
present
she
has
been
a
true
and
sympathizing
friend
blessings
be
with
her
and
hers
about
the
time
that
i
reentered
the
bruce
family
an
event
occurred
of
disastrous
import
to
the
colored
people
the
slave
hamlin
the
first
fugitive
that
came
under
the
new
law
was
given
up
by
the
bloodhounds
of
the
north
to
the
bloodhounds
of
the
south
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
reign
of
terror
to
the
colored
population
the
great
city
rushed
on
in
its
whirl
of
excitement
taking
no
note
of
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
but
while
fashionables
were
listening
to
the
thrilling
voice
of
jenny
lind
in
metropolitan
hall
the
thrilling
voices
of
poor
hunted
colored
people
went
up
in
an
agony
of
supplication
to
the
lord
from
zion
church
many
families
who
had
lived
in
the
city
for
twenty
years
fled
from
it
now
many
a
poor
washerwoman
who
by
hard
labor
had
made
herself
a
comfortable
home
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
her
furniture
bid
a
hurried
farewell
to
friends
and
seek
her
fortune
among
strangers
in
canada
many
a
wife
discovered
a
secret
she
had
never
known
before
that
her
husband
was
a
fugitive
and
must
leave
her
to
insure
his
own
safety
worse
still
many
a
husband
discovered
that
his
wife
had
fled
from
slavery
years
ago
and
as
the
child
follows
the
condition
of
its
mother
the
children
of
his
love
were
liable
to
be
seized
and
carried
into
slavery
every
where
in
those
humble
homes
there
was
consternation
and
anguish
but
what
cared
the
legislators
of
the
dominant
race
for
the
blood
they
were
crushing
out
of
trampled
hearts
when
my
brother
william
spent
his
last
evening
with
me
before
he
went
to
california
we
talked
nearly
all
the
time
of
the
distress
brought
on
our
oppressed
people
by
the
passage
of
this
iniquitous
law
and
never
had
i
seen
him
manifest
such
bitterness
of
spirit
such
stern
hostility
to
our
oppressors
he
was
himself
free
from
the
operation
of
the
law
for
he
did
not
run
from
any
slaveholding
state
being
brought
into
the
free
states
by
his
master
but
i
was
subject
to
it
and
so
were
hundreds
of
intelligent
and
industrious
people
all
around
us
i
seldom
ventured
into
the
streets
and
when
it
was
necessary
to
do
an
errand
for
bruce
or
any
of
the
family
i
went
as
much
as
possible
through
back
streets
and
what
a
disgrace
to
a
city
calling
itself
free
that
inhabitants
guiltless
of
offence
and
seeking
to
perform
their
duties
conscientiously
should
be
condemned
to
live
in
such
incessant
fear
and
have
nowhere
to
turn
for
protection
this
state
of
things
of
course
gave
rise
to
many
impromptu
vigilance
committees
every
colored
person
and
every
friend
of
their
persecuted
race
kept
their
eyes
wide
open
every
evening
i
examined
the
newspapers
carefully
to
see
what
southerners
had
put
up
at
the
hotels
i
did
this
for
my
own
sake
thinking
my
young
mistress
and
her
husband
might
be
among
the
list
i
wished
also
to
give
information
to
others
if
necessary
for
if
many
were
running
to
and
fro
i
resolved
that
knowledge
should
be
increased
this
brings
up
one
of
my
southern
reminiscences
which
i
will
here
briefly
relate
i
was
somewhat
acquainted
with
a
slave
named
luke
who
belonged
to
a
wealthy
man
in
our
vicinity
his
master
died
leaving
a
son
and
daughter
heirs
to
his
large
fortune
in
the
division
of
the
slaves
luke
was
included
in
the
son
portion
this
young
man
became
a
prey
to
the
vices
he
went
to
the
north
to
complete
his
education
he
carried
his
vices
with
him
he
was
brought
home
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
by
excessive
dissipation
luke
was
appointed
to
wait
upon
his
master
whose
despotic
habits
were
greatly
increased
by
exasperation
at
his
own
helplessness
he
kept
a
cowhide
beside
him
and
for
the
most
trivial
occurrence
he
would
order
his
attendant
to
bare
his
back
and
kneel
beside
the
couch
while
he
whipped
him
till
his
strength
was
exhausted
some
days
he
was
not
allowed
to
wear
any
thing
but
his
shirt
in
order
to
be
in
readiness
to
be
flogged
a
day
seldom
passed
without
his
receiving
more
or
less
blows
if
the
slightest
resistance
was
offered
the
town
constable
was
sent
for
to
execute
the
punishment
and
luke
learned
from
experience
how
much
more
the
constable
strong
arm
was
to
be
dreaded
than
the
comparatively
feeble
one
of
his
master
the
arm
of
his
tyrant
grew
weaker
and
was
finally
palsied
and
then
the
constable
services
were
in
constant
requisition
the
fact
that
he
was
entirely
dependent
on
luke
care
and
was
obliged
to
be
tended
like
an
infant
instead
of
inspiring
any
gratitude
or
compassion
towards
his
poor
slave
seemed
only
to
increase
his
irritability
and
cruelty
as
he
lay
there
on
his
bed
a
mere
degraded
wreck
of
manhood
he
took
into
his
head
the
strangest
freaks
of
despotism
and
if
luke
hesitated
to
submit
to
his
orders
the
constable
was
immediately
sent
for
some
of
these
freaks
were
of
a
nature
too
filthy
to
be
repeated
when
i
fled
from
the
house
of
bondage
i
left
poor
luke
still
chained
to
the
bedside
of
this
cruel
and
disgusting
wretch
one
day
when
i
had
been
requested
to
do
an
errand
for
bruce
i
was
hurrying
through
back
streets
as
usual
when
i
saw
a
young
man
approaching
whose
face
was
familiar
to
me
as
he
came
nearer
i
recognized
luke
i
always
rejoiced
to
see
or
hear
of
any
one
who
had
escaped
from
the
black
pit
i
was
peculiarly
glad
to
see
him
on
northern
soil
though
i
no
longer
called
it
soil
i
well
remembered
what
a
desolate
feeling
it
was
to
be
alone
among
strangers
and
i
went
up
to
him
and
greeted
him
cordially
at
first
he
did
not
know
me
but
when
i
mentioned
my
name
he
remembered
all
about
me
i
told
him
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
asked
him
if
he
did
not
know
that
new
york
was
a
city
of
kidnappers
he
replied
de
risk
ai
so
bad
for
me
as
is
fur
you
i
runned
away
from
de
speculator
and
you
runned
away
from
de
massa
dem
speculators
vont
spen
dar
money
to
come
here
fur
a
runaway
if
dey
ai
sartin
sure
to
put
dar
hans
right
on
him
an
i
tell
you
i
tuk
good
car
dat
i
had
too
hard
times
down
dar
to
let
ketch
dis
nigger
he
then
told
me
of
the
advice
he
had
received
and
the
plans
he
had
laid
i
asked
if
he
had
money
enough
to
take
him
to
canada
upon
it
i
hab
he
replied
i
tuk
car
fur
dat
i
bin
workin
all
my
days
fur
dem
cussed
whites
an
got
no
pay
but
kicks
and
cuffs
so
i
tought
dis
nigger
had
a
right
to
money
nuff
to
bring
him
to
de
free
states
massa
henry
he
lib
till

an
ven
he
did

i
knowed
de
debbil
would
hab
him
an
vould
vant
him
to
bring
his
money
too
so
i
tuk
some
of
his
bills
and
put
in
de
pocket
of
his
ole
trousers
an
ven
he
was
buried
dis
nigger
ask
fur
dem
ole
trousers
an
dey
gub
to
me
with
a
low
chuckling
laugh
he
added
you
see
i
did
it
dey
it
to
me
i
tell
you
i
had
mighty
hard
time
to
keep
de
speculator
from
findin
it
but
he
did
git
it
this
is
a
fair
specimen
of
how
the
moral
sense
is
educated
by
slavery
when
a
man
has
his
wages
stolen
from
him
year
after
year
and
the
laws
sanction
and
enforce
the
theft
how
can
he
be
expected
to
have
more
regard
to
honesty
than
has
the
man
who
robs
him
i
have
become
somewhat
enlightened
but
i
confess
that
i
agree
with
poor
ignorant
luke
in
thinking
he
had
a
to
that
money
as
a
portion
of
his
unpaid
wages
he
went
to
canada
forthwith
and
i
have
not
since
heard
from
him
all
that
winter
i
lived
in
a
state
of
anxiety
when
i
took
the
children
out
to
breathe
the
air
i
closely
observed
the
countenances
of
all
i
met
i
dreaded
the
approach
of
summer
when
snakes
and
slaveholders
make
their
appearance
i
was
in
fact
a
slave
in
new
york
as
subject
to
slave
laws
as
i
had
been
in
a
slave
state
strange
incongruity
in
a
state
called
free
spring
returned
and
i
received
warning
from
the
south
that
flint
knew
of
my
return
to
my
old
place
and
was
making
preparations
to
have
me
caught
i
learned
afterwards
that
my
dress
and
that
of
children
had
been
described
to
him
by
some
of
the
northern
tools
which
slaveholders
employ
for
their
base
purposes
and
then
indulge
in
sneers
at
their
cupidity
and
mean
servility
i
immediately
informed
bruce
of
my
danger
and
she
took
prompt
measures
for
my
safety
my
place
as
nurse
could
not
be
supplied
immediately
and
this
generous
sympathizing
lady
proposed
that
i
should
carry
her
baby
away
it
was
a
comfort
to
me
to
have
the
child
with
me
for
the
heart
is
reluctant
to
be
torn
away
from
every
object
it
loves
but
how
few
mothers
would
have
consented
to
have
one
of
their
own
babes
become
a
fugitive
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
hunted
nurse
on
whom
the
legislators
of
the
country
had
let
loose
the
bloodhounds
when
i
spoke
of
the
sacrifice
she
was
making
in
depriving
herself
of
her
dear
baby
she
replied
it
is
better
for
you
to
have
baby
with
you
linda
for
if
they
get
on
your
track
they
will
be
obliged
to
bring
the
child
to
me
and
then
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
saving
you
you
shall
be
saved
this
lady
had
a
very
wealthy
relative
a
benevolent
gentleman
in
many
respects
but
aristocratic
and
he
remonstrated
with
her
for
harboring
a
fugitive
slave
told
her
she
was
violating
the
laws
of
her
country
and
asked
her
if
she
was
aware
of
the
penalty
she
replied
i
am
very
well
aware
of
it
it
is
imprisonment
and
one
thousand
dollars
fine
shame
on
my
country
that
it
so
i
am
ready
to
incur
the
penalty
i
will
go
to
the
state
prison
rather
than
have
any
poor
victim
torn
from
house
to
be
carried
back
to
slavery
the
noble
heart
the
brave
heart
the
tears
are
in
my
eyes
while
i
write
of
her
may
the
god
of
the
helpless
reward
her
for
her
sympathy
with
my
persecuted
people
i
was
sent
into
new
england
where
i
was
sheltered
by
the
wife
of
a
senator
whom
i
shall
always
hold
in
grateful
remembrance
this
honorable
gentleman
would
not
have
voted
for
the
fugitive
slave
law
as
did
the
senator
in
uncle
tom
cabin
on
the
contrary
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
it
but
he
was
enough
under
its
influence
to
be
afraid
of
having
me
remain
in
his
house
many
hours
so
i
was
sent
into
the
country
where
i
remained
a
month
with
the
baby
when
it
was
supposed
that
flint
emissaries
had
lost
track
of
me
and
given
up
the
pursuit
for
the
present
i
returned
to
new
york
xli
free
at
last
bruce
and
every
member
of
her
family
were
exceedingly
kind
to
me
i
was
thankful
for
the
blessings
of
my
lot
yet
i
could
not
always
wear
a
cheerful
countenance
i
was
doing
harm
to
no
one
on
the
contrary
i
was
doing
all
the
good
i
could
in
my
small
way
yet
i
could
never
go
out
to
breathe
god
free
air
without
trepidation
at
my
heart
this
seemed
hard
and
i
could
not
think
it
was
a
right
state
of
things
in
any
civilized
country
from
time
to
time
i
received
news
from
my
good
old
grandmother
she
could
not
write
but
she
employed
others
to
write
for
her
the
following
is
an
extract
from
one
of
her
last
letters
dear
daughter
i
can
not
hope
to
see
you
again
on
earth
but
i
pray
to
god
to
unite
us
above
where
pain
will
no
more
rack
this
feeble
body
of
mine
where
sorrow
and
parting
from
my
children
will
be
no
more
god
has
promised
these
things
if
we
are
faithful
unto
the
end
my
age
and
feeble
health
deprive
me
of
going
to
church
now
but
god
is
with
me
here
at
home
thank
your
brother
for
his
kindness
give
much
love
to
him
and
tell
him
to
remember
the
creator
in
the
days
of
his
youth
and
strive
to
meet
me
in
the
father
kingdom
love
to
ellen
and
benjamin
do
neglect
him
tell
him
for
me
to
be
a
good
boy
strive
my
child
to
train
them
for
god
children
may
he
protect
and
provide
for
you
is
the
prayer
of
your
loving
old
mother
these
letters
both
cheered
and
saddened
me
i
was
always
glad
to
have
tidings
from
the
kind
faithful
old
friend
of
my
unhappy
youth
but
her
messages
of
love
made
my
heart
yearn
to
see
her
before
she
died
and
i
mourned
over
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
some
months
after
i
returned
from
my
flight
to
new
england
i
received
a
letter
from
her
in
which
she
wrote
flint
is
dead
he
has
left
a
distressed
family
poor
old
man
i
hope
he
made
his
peace
with
god
i
remembered
how
he
had
defrauded
my
grandmother
of
the
hard
earnings
she
had
loaned
how
he
had
tried
to
cheat
her
out
of
the
freedom
her
mistress
had
promised
her
and
how
he
had
persecuted
her
children
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
she
was
a
better
christian
than
i
was
if
she
could
entirely
forgive
him
i
can
not
say
with
truth
that
the
news
of
my
old
death
softened
my
feelings
towards
him
there
are
wrongs
which
even
the
grave
does
not
bury
the
man
was
odious
to
me
while
he
lived
and
his
memory
is
odious
now
his
departure
from
this
world
did
not
diminish
my
danger
he
had
threatened
my
grandmother
that
his
heirs
should
hold
me
in
slavery
after
he
was
gone
that
i
never
should
be
free
so
long
as
a
child
of
his
survived
as
for
flint
i
had
seen
her
in
deeper
afflictions
than
i
supposed
the
loss
of
her
husband
would
be
for
she
had
buried
several
children
yet
i
never
saw
any
signs
of
softening
in
her
heart
the
doctor
had
died
in
embarrassed
circumstances
and
had
little
to
will
to
his
heirs
except
such
property
as
he
was
unable
to
grasp
i
was
well
aware
what
i
had
to
expect
from
the
family
of
flints
and
my
fears
were
confirmed
by
a
letter
from
the
south
warning
me
to
be
on
my
guard
because
flint
openly
declared
that
her
daughter
could
not
afford
to
lose
so
valuable
a
slave
as
i
was
i
kept
close
watch
of
the
newspapers
for
arrivals
but
one
saturday
night
being
much
occupied
i
forgot
to
examine
the
evening
express
as
usual
i
went
down
into
the
parlor
for
it
early
in
the
morning
and
found
the
boy
about
to
kindle
a
fire
with
it
i
took
it
from
him
and
examined
the
list
of
arrivals
reader
if
you
have
never
been
a
slave
you
can
not
imagine
the
acute
sensation
of
suffering
at
my
heart
when
i
read
the
names
of
and
mrs
dodge
at
a
hotel
in
courtland
street
it
was
a
hotel
and
that
circumstance
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
what
i
had
heard
that
they
were
short
of
funds
and
had
need
of
my
value
as
valued
me
and
that
was
by
dollars
and
cents
i
hastened
with
the
paper
to
bruce
her
heart
and
hand
were
always
open
to
every
one
in
distress
and
she
always
warmly
sympathized
with
mine
it
was
impossible
to
tell
how
near
the
enemy
was
he
might
have
passed
and
repassed
the
house
while
we
were
sleeping
he
might
at
that
moment
be
waiting
to
pounce
upon
me
if
i
ventured
out
of
doors
i
had
never
seen
the
husband
of
my
young
mistress
and
therefore
i
could
not
distinguish
him
from
any
other
stranger
a
carriage
was
hastily
ordered
and
closely
veiled
i
followed
bruce
taking
the
baby
again
with
me
into
exile
after
various
turnings
and
crossings
and
returnings
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
of
one
of
bruce
friends
where
i
was
kindly
received
bruce
returned
immediately
to
instruct
the
domestics
what
to
say
if
any
one
came
to
inquire
for
me
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
the
evening
paper
was
not
burned
up
before
i
had
a
chance
to
examine
the
list
of
arrivals
it
was
not
long
after
return
to
her
house
before
several
people
came
to
inquire
for
me
one
inquired
for
me
another
asked
for
my
daughter
ellen
and
another
said
he
had
a
letter
from
my
grandmother
which
he
was
requested
to
deliver
in
person
they
were
told
she
lived
here
but
she
has
left
how
long
ago
i
do
know
sir
do
you
know
where
she
went
i
do
not
sir
and
the
door
was
closed
this
mr
dodge
who
claimed
me
as
his
property
was
originally
a
yankee
pedler
in
the
south
then
he
became
a
merchant
and
finally
a
slaveholder
he
managed
to
get
introduced
into
what
was
called
the
first
society
and
married
miss
emily
flint
a
quarrel
arose
between
him
and
her
brother
and
the
brother
cowhided
him
this
led
to
a
family
feud
and
he
proposed
to
remove
to
virginia
flint
left
him
no
property
and
his
own
means
had
become
circumscribed
while
a
wife
and
children
depended
upon
him
for
support
under
these
circumstances
it
was
very
natural
that
he
should
make
an
effort
to
put
me
into
his
pocket
i
had
a
colored
friend
a
man
from
my
native
place
in
whom
i
had
the
most
implicit
confidence
i
sent
for
him
and
told
him
that
and
mrs
dodge
had
arrived
in
new
york
i
proposed
that
he
should
call
upon
them
to
make
inquiries
about
his
friends
at
the
south
with
whom
flint
family
were
well
acquainted
he
thought
there
was
no
impropriety
in
his
doing
so
and
he
consented
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
mr
room
which
was
opened
by
the
gentleman
himself
who
gruffly
inquired
what
brought
you
here
how
came
you
to
know
i
was
in
the
city
your
arrival
was
published
in
the
evening
papers
sir
and
i
called
to
ask
mrs
dodge
about
my
friends
at
home
i
did
suppose
it
would
give
any
offence
where
that
negro
girl
that
belongs
to
my
wife
what
girl
sir
you
know
well
enough
i
mean
linda
that
ran
away
from
plantation
some
years
ago
i
dare
say
you
seen
her
and
know
where
she
is
yes
sir
i
seen
her
and
know
where
she
is
she
is
out
of
your
reach
sir
tell
me
where
she
is
or
bring
her
to
me
and
i
will
give
her
a
chance
to
buy
her
freedom
i
do
think
it
would
be
of
any
use
sir
i
have
heard
her
say
she
would
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
rather
than
pay
any
man
or
woman
for
her
freedom
because
she
thinks
she
has
a
right
to
it
besides
she
could
do
it
if
she
would
for
she
has
spent
her
earnings
to
educate
her
children
this
made
mr
dodge
very
angry
and
some
high
words
passed
between
them
my
friend
was
afraid
to
come
where
i
was
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
received
a
note
from
him
i
supposed
they
had
not
come
from
the
south
in
the
winter
for
a
pleasure
excursion
and
now
the
nature
of
their
business
was
very
plain
bruce
came
to
me
and
entreated
me
to
leave
the
city
the
next
morning
she
said
her
house
was
watched
and
it
was
possible
that
some
clew
to
me
might
be
obtained
i
refused
to
take
her
advice
she
pleaded
with
an
earnest
tenderness
that
ought
to
have
moved
me
but
i
was
in
a
bitter
disheartened
mood
i
was
weary
of
flying
from
pillar
to
post
i
had
been
chased
during
half
my
life
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
chase
was
never
to
end
there
i
sat
in
that
great
city
guiltless
of
crime
yet
not
daring
to
worship
god
in
any
of
the
churches
i
heard
the
bells
ringing
for
afternoon
service
and
with
contemptuous
sarcasm
i
said
will
the
preachers
take
for
their
text
liberty
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
or
will
they
preach
from
the
text
unto
others
as
ye
would
they
should
do
unto
you
oppressed
poles
and
hungarians
could
find
a
safe
refuge
in
that
city
john
mitchell
was
free
to
proclaim
in
the
city
hall
his
desire
for
a
plantation
well
stocked
with
slaves
but
there
i
sat
an
oppressed
american
not
daring
to
show
my
face
god
forgive
the
black
and
bitter
thoughts
i
indulged
on
that
sabbath
day
the
scripture
says
oppression
makes
even
a
wise
man
mad
and
i
was
not
wise
i
had
been
told
that
mr
dodge
said
his
wife
had
never
signed
away
her
right
to
my
children
and
if
he
could
not
get
me
he
would
take
them
this
it
was
more
than
any
thing
else
that
roused
such
a
tempest
in
my
soul
benjamin
was
with
his
uncle
william
in
california
but
my
innocent
young
daughter
had
come
to
spend
a
vacation
with
me
i
thought
of
what
i
had
suffered
in
slavery
at
her
age
and
my
heart
was
like
a
tiger
when
a
hunter
tries
to
seize
her
young
dear
bruce
i
seem
to
see
the
expression
of
her
face
as
she
turned
away
discouraged
by
my
obstinate
mood
finding
her
expostulations
unavailing
she
sent
ellen
to
entreat
me
when
ten
in
the
evening
arrived
and
ellen
had
not
returned
this
watchful
and
unwearied
friend
became
anxious
she
came
to
us
in
a
carriage
bringing
a
trunk
for
my
journey
trusting
that
by
this
time
i
would
listen
to
reason
i
yielded
to
her
as
i
ought
to
have
done
before
the
next
day
baby
and
i
set
out
in
a
heavy
snow
storm
bound
for
new
england
again
i
received
letters
from
the
city
of
iniquity
addressed
to
me
under
an
assumed
name
in
a
few
days
one
came
from
bruce
informing
me
that
my
new
master
was
still
searching
for
me
and
that
she
intended
to
put
an
end
to
this
persecution
by
buying
my
freedom
i
felt
grateful
for
the
kindness
that
prompted
this
offer
but
the
idea
was
not
so
pleasant
to
me
as
might
have
been
expected
the
more
my
mind
had
become
enlightened
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
me
to
consider
myself
an
article
of
property
and
to
pay
money
to
those
who
had
so
grievously
oppressed
me
seemed
like
taking
from
my
sufferings
the
glory
of
triumph
i
wrote
to
bruce
thanking
her
but
saying
that
being
sold
from
one
owner
to
another
seemed
too
much
like
slavery
that
such
a
great
obligation
could
not
be
easily
cancelled
and
that
i
preferred
to
go
to
my
brother
in
california
without
my
knowledge
bruce
employed
a
gentleman
in
new
york
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
mr
dodge
he
proposed
to
pay
three
hundred
dollars
down
if
mr
dodge
would
sell
me
and
enter
into
obligations
to
relinquish
all
claim
to
me
or
my
children
forever
after
he
who
called
himself
my
master
said
he
scorned
so
small
an
offer
for
such
a
valuable
servant
the
gentleman
replied
you
can
do
as
you
choose
sir
if
you
reject
this
offer
you
will
never
get
any
thing
for
the
woman
has
friends
who
will
convey
her
and
her
children
out
of
the
country
mr
dodge
concluded
that
half
a
loaf
was
better
than
no
bread
and
he
agreed
to
the
proffered
terms
by
the
next
mail
i
received
this
brief
letter
from
bruce
i
am
rejoiced
to
tell
you
that
the
money
for
your
freedom
has
been
paid
to
mr
dodge
come
home
i
long
to
see
you
and
my
sweet
babe
my
brain
reeled
as
i
read
these
lines
a
gentleman
near
me
said
true
i
have
seen
the
bill
of
sale
the
bill
of
sale
those
words
struck
me
like
a
blow
so
i
was
at
last
a
human
being
in
the
free
city
of
new
york
the
bill
of
sale
is
on
record
and
future
generations
will
learn
from
it
that
women
were
articles
of
traffic
in
new
york
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
christian
religion
it
may
hereafter
prove
a
useful
document
to
antiquaries
who
are
seeking
to
measure
the
progress
of
civilization
in
the
united
states
i
well
know
the
value
of
that
bit
of
paper
but
much
as
i
love
freedom
i
do
not
like
to
look
upon
it
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
the
generous
friend
who
procured
it
but
i
despise
the
miscreant
who
demanded
payment
for
what
never
rightfully
belonged
to
him
or
his
i
had
objected
to
having
my
freedom
bought
yet
i
must
confess
that
when
it
was
done
i
felt
as
if
a
heavy
load
had
been
lifted
from
my
weary
shoulders
when
i
rode
home
in
the
cars
i
was
no
longer
afraid
to
unveil
my
face
and
look
at
people
as
they
passed
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
met
daniel
dodge
himself
to
have
had
him
seen
me
and
known
me
that
he
might
have
mourned
over
the
untoward
circumstances
which
compelled
him
to
sell
me
for
three
hundred
dollars
when
i
reached
home
the
arms
of
my
benefactress
were
thrown
round
me
and
our
tears
mingled
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
o
linda
i
glad
it
all
over
you
wrote
to
me
as
if
you
thought
you
were
going
to
be
transferred
from
one
owner
to
another
but
i
did
not
buy
you
for
your
services
i
should
have
done
just
the
same
if
you
had
been
going
to
sail
for
california
i
should
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
left
me
a
free
woman
my
heart
was
exceedingly
full
i
remembered
how
my
poor
father
had
tried
to
buy
me
when
i
was
a
small
child
and
how
he
had
been
disappointed
i
hoped
his
spirit
was
rejoicing
over
me
now
i
remembered
how
my
good
old
grandmother
had
laid
up
her
earnings
to
purchase
me
in
later
years
and
how
often
her
plans
had
been
frustrated
how
that
faithful
loving
old
heart
would
leap
for
joy
if
she
could
look
on
me
and
my
children
now
that
we
were
free
my
relatives
had
been
foiled
in
all
their
efforts
but
god
had
raised
me
up
a
friend
among
strangers
who
had
bestowed
on
me
the
precious
boon
friend
it
is
a
common
word
often
lightly
used
like
other
good
and
beautiful
things
it
may
be
tarnished
by
careless
handling
but
when
i
speak
of
bruce
as
my
friend
the
word
is
sacred
my
grandmother
lived
to
rejoice
in
my
freedom
but
not
long
after
a
letter
came
with
a
black
seal
she
had
gone
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
time
passed
on
and
a
paper
came
to
me
from
the
south
containing
an
obituary
notice
of
my
uncle
phillip
it
was
the
only
case
i
ever
knew
of
such
an
honor
conferred
upon
a
colored
person
it
was
written
by
one
of
his
friends
and
contained
these
words
now
that
death
has
laid
him
low
they
call
him
a
good
man
and
a
useful
citizen
but
what
are
eulogies
to
the
black
man
when
the
world
has
faded
from
his
vision
it
does
not
require
man
praise
to
obtain
rest
in
god
kingdom
so
they
called
a
colored
man
a
strange
words
to
be
uttered
in
that
region
reader
my
story
ends
with
freedom
not
in
the
usual
way
with
marriage
i
and
my
children
are
now
free
we
are
as
free
from
the
power
of
slaveholders
as
are
the
white
people
of
the
north
and
though
that
according
to
my
ideas
is
not
saying
a
great
deal
it
is
a
vast
improvement
in
condition
the
dream
of
my
life
is
not
yet
realized
i
do
not
sit
with
my
children
in
a
home
of
my
own
i
still
long
for
a
hearthstone
of
my
own
however
humble
i
wish
it
for
my
children
sake
far
more
than
for
my
own
but
god
so
orders
circumstances
as
to
keep
me
with
my
friend
bruce
love
duty
gratitude
also
bind
me
to
her
side
it
is
a
privilege
to
serve
her
who
pities
my
oppressed
people
and
who
has
bestowed
the
inestimable
boon
of
freedom
on
me
and
my
children
it
has
been
painful
to
me
in
many
ways
to
recall
the
dreary
years
i
passed
in
bondage
i
would
gladly
forget
them
if
i
could
yet
the
retrospection
is
not
altogether
without
solace
for
with
those
gloomy
recollections
come
tender
memories
of
my
good
old
grandmother
like
light
fleecy
clouds
floating
over
a
dark
and
troubled
sea
appendix
the
following
statement
is
from
amy
post
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
in
the
state
of
new
york
well
known
and
highly
respected
by
friends
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
as
has
been
already
stated
in
the
preceding
pages
the
author
of
this
volume
spent
some
time
under
her
hospitable
roof
the
author
of
this
book
is
my
friend
if
its
readers
knew
her
as
i
know
her
they
could
not
fail
to
be
deeply
interested
in
her
story
she
was
a
beloved
inmate
of
our
family
nearly
the
whole
of
the
year
she
was
introduced
to
us
by
her
affectionate
and
conscientious
brother
who
had
previously
related
to
us
some
of
the
almost
incredible
events
in
his
sister
life
i
immediately
became
much
interested
in
linda
for
her
appearance
was
prepossessing
and
her
deportment
indicated
remarkable
delicacy
of
feeling
and
purity
of
thought
as
we
became
acquainted
she
related
to
me
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
incidents
in
her
bitter
experiences
as
a
though
impelled
by
a
natural
craving
for
human
sympathy
she
passed
through
a
baptism
of
suffering
even
in
recounting
her
trials
to
me
in
private
confidential
conversations
the
burden
of
these
memories
lay
heavily
upon
her
spirit
naturally
virtuous
and
refined
i
repeatedly
urged
her
to
consent
to
the
publication
of
her
narrative
for
i
felt
that
it
would
arouse
people
to
a
more
earnest
work
for
the
disinthralment
of
millions
still
remaining
in
that
condition
which
was
so
unendurable
to
her
but
her
sensitive
spirit
shrank
from
publicity
she
said
you
know
a
woman
can
whisper
her
cruel
wrongs
in
the
ear
of
a
dear
friend
much
easier
than
she
can
record
them
for
the
world
to
read
even
in
talking
with
me
she
wept
so
much
and
seemed
to
suffer
such
mental
agony
that
i
felt
her
story
was
too
sacred
to
be
drawn
from
her
by
inquisitive
questions
and
i
left
her
free
to
tell
as
much
or
as
little
as
she
chose
still
i
urged
upon
her
the
duty
of
publishing
her
experience
for
the
sake
of
the
good
it
might
do
and
at
last
she
undertook
the
task
having
been
a
slave
so
large
a
portion
of
her
life
she
is
unlearned
she
is
obliged
to
earn
her
living
by
her
own
labor
and
she
has
worked
untiringly
to
procure
education
for
her
children
several
times
she
has
been
obliged
to
leave
her
employments
in
order
to
fly
from
the
and
of
our
land
but
she
pressed
through
all
these
obstacles
and
overcame
them
after
the
labors
of
the
day
were
over
she
traced
secretly
and
wearily
by
the
midnight
lamp
a
truthful
record
of
her
eventful
life
this
empire
state
is
a
shabby
place
of
refuge
for
the
oppressed
but
here
through
anxiety
turmoil
and
despair
the
freedom
of
linda
and
her
children
was
finally
secured
by
the
exertions
of
a
generous
friend
she
was
grateful
for
the
boon
but
the
idea
of
having
been
was
always
galling
to
a
spirit
that
could
never
acknowledge
itself
to
be
a
chattel
she
wrote
to
us
thus
soon
after
the
event
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
expressions
in
regard
to
my
freedom
but
the
freedom
i
had
before
the
money
was
paid
was
dearer
to
me
god
gave
me
freedom
but
man
put
god
image
in
the
scales
with
the
paltry
sum
of
three
hundred
dollars
i
served
for
my
liberty
as
faithfully
as
jacob
served
for
rachel
at
the
end
he
had
large
possessions
but
i
was
robbed
of
my
victory
i
was
obliged
to
resign
my
crown
to
rid
myself
of
a
tyrant
her
story
as
written
by
herself
can
not
fail
to
interest
the
reader
it
is
a
sad
illustration
of
the
condition
of
this
country
which
boasts
of
its
civilization
while
it
sanctions
laws
and
customs
which
make
the
experiences
of
the
present
more
strange
than
any
fictions
of
the
past
amy
post
rochester
the
following
testimonial
is
from
a
man
who
is
now
a
highly
respectable
colored
citizen
of
boston
this
narrative
contains
some
incidents
so
extraordinary
that
doubtless
many
persons
under
whose
eyes
it
may
chance
to
fall
will
be
ready
to
believe
that
it
is
colored
highly
to
serve
a
special
purpose
but
however
it
may
be
regarded
by
the
incredulous
i
know
that
it
is
full
of
living
truths
i
have
been
well
acquainted
with
the
author
from
my
boyhood
the
circumstances
recounted
in
her
history
are
perfectly
familiar
to
me
i
knew
of
her
treatment
from
her
master
of
the
imprisonment
of
her
children
of
their
sale
and
redemption
of
her
seven
years
concealment
and
of
her
subsequent
escape
to
the
north
i
am
now
a
resident
of
boston
and
am
a
living
witness
to
the
truth
of
this
interesting
narrative
