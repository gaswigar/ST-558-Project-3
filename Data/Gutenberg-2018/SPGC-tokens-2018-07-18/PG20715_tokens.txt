marriage
and
love
the
popular
notion
about
marriage
and
love
is
that
they
are
synonymous
that
they
spring
from
the
same
motives
and
cover
the
same
human
needs
like
most
popular
notions
this
also
rests
not
on
actual
facts
but
on
superstition
marriage
and
love
have
nothing
in
common
they
are
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
are
in
fact
antagonistic
to
each
other
no
doubt
some
marriages
have
been
the
result
of
love
not
however
because
love
could
assert
itself
only
in
marriage
much
rather
is
it
because
few
people
can
completely
outgrow
a
convention
there
are
today
large
numbers
of
men
and
women
to
whom
marriage
is
naught
but
a
farce
but
who
submit
to
it
for
the
sake
of
public
opinion
at
any
rate
while
it
is
true
that
some
marriages
are
based
on
love
and
while
it
is
equally
true
that
in
some
cases
love
continues
in
married
life
i
maintain
that
it
does
so
regardless
of
marriage
and
not
because
of
it
on
the
other
hand
it
is
utterly
false
that
love
results
from
marriage
on
rare
occasions
one
does
hear
of
a
miraculous
case
of
a
married
couple
falling
in
love
after
marriage
but
on
close
examination
it
will
be
found
that
it
is
a
mere
adjustment
to
the
inevitable
certainly
the
to
each
other
is
far
away
from
the
spontaneity
the
intensity
and
beauty
of
love
without
which
the
intimacy
of
marriage
must
prove
degrading
to
both
the
woman
and
the
man
marriage
is
primarily
an
economic
arrangement
an
insurance
pact
it
differs
from
the
ordinary
life
insurance
agreement
only
in
that
it
is
more
binding
more
exacting
its
returns
are
insignificantly
small
compared
with
the
investments
in
taking
out
an
insurance
policy
one
pays
for
it
in
dollars
and
cents
always
at
liberty
to
discontinue
payments
if
however
woman
premium
is
a
husband
she
pays
for
it
with
her
name
her
privacy
her
her
very
life
until
death
doth
part
moreover
the
marriage
insurance
condemns
her
to
dependency
to
parasitism
to
complete
uselessness
individual
as
well
as
social
man
too
pays
his
toll
but
as
his
sphere
is
wider
marriage
does
not
limit
him
as
much
as
woman
he
feels
his
chains
more
in
an
economic
sense
thus
dante
motto
over
inferno
applies
with
equal
force
to
marriage
ye
who
enter
here
leave
all
hope
behind
that
marriage
is
a
failure
none
but
the
very
stupid
will
deny
one
has
but
to
glance
over
the
statistics
of
divorce
to
realize
how
bitter
a
failure
marriage
really
is
nor
will
the
stereotyped
philistine
argument
that
the
laxity
of
divorce
laws
and
the
growing
looseness
of
woman
account
for
the
fact
that
first
every
twelfth
marriage
ends
in
divorce
second
that
since
divorces
have
increased
from
to
for
every
hundred
thousand
population
third
that
adultery
since
as
ground
for
divorce
has
increased
per
cent
fourth
that
desertion
increased
per
cent
added
to
these
startling
figures
is
a
vast
amount
of
material
dramatic
and
literary
further
elucidating
this
subject
robert
herrick
in
pinero
in
eugene
walter
in
in
and
scores
of
other
writers
are
discussing
the
barrenness
the
monotony
the
sordidness
the
inadequacy
of
marriage
as
a
factor
for
harmony
and
understanding
the
thoughtful
social
student
will
not
content
himself
with
the
popular
superficial
excuse
for
this
phenomenon
he
will
have
to
dig
down
deeper
into
the
very
life
of
the
sexes
to
know
why
marriage
proves
so
disastrous
edward
carpenter
says
that
behind
every
marriage
stands
the
environment
of
the
two
sexes
an
environment
so
different
from
each
other
that
man
and
woman
must
remain
strangers
separated
by
an
insurmountable
wall
of
superstition
custom
and
habit
marriage
has
not
the
potentiality
of
developing
knowledge
of
and
respect
for
each
other
without
which
every
union
is
doomed
to
failure
henrik
ibsen
the
hater
of
all
social
shams
was
probably
the
first
to
realize
this
great
truth
nora
leaves
her
husband
not
as
the
stupid
critic
would
have
it
because
she
is
tired
of
her
responsibilities
or
feels
the
need
of
woman
rights
but
because
she
has
come
to
know
that
for
eight
years
she
had
lived
with
a
stranger
and
borne
him
children
can
there
be
anything
more
humiliating
more
degrading
than
a
proximity
between
two
strangers
no
need
for
the
woman
to
know
anything
of
the
man
save
his
income
as
to
the
knowledge
of
the
woman
what
is
there
to
know
except
that
she
has
a
pleasing
appearance
we
have
not
yet
outgrown
the
theologic
myth
that
woman
has
no
soul
that
she
is
a
mere
appendix
to
man
made
out
of
his
rib
just
for
the
convenience
of
the
gentleman
who
was
so
strong
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
own
shadow
perchance
the
poor
quality
of
the
material
whence
woman
comes
is
responsible
for
her
inferiority
at
any
rate
woman
has
no
soul
what
is
there
to
know
about
her
besides
the
less
soul
a
woman
has
the
greater
her
asset
as
a
wife
the
more
readily
will
she
absorb
herself
in
her
husband
it
is
this
slavish
acquiescence
to
man
superiority
that
has
kept
the
marriage
institution
seemingly
intact
for
so
long
a
period
now
that
woman
is
coming
into
her
own
now
that
she
is
actually
growing
aware
of
herself
as
a
being
outside
of
the
master
grace
the
sacred
institution
of
marriage
is
gradually
being
undermined
and
no
amount
of
sentimental
lamentation
can
stay
it
from
infancy
almost
the
average
girl
is
told
that
marriage
is
her
ultimate
goal
therefore
her
training
and
education
must
be
directed
towards
that
end
like
the
mute
beast
fattened
for
slaughter
she
is
prepared
for
that
yet
strange
to
say
she
is
allowed
to
know
much
less
about
her
function
as
wife
and
mother
than
the
ordinary
artisan
of
his
trade
it
is
indecent
and
filthy
for
a
respectable
girl
to
know
anything
of
the
marital
relation
oh
for
the
inconsistency
of
respectability
that
needs
the
marriage
vow
to
turn
something
which
is
filthy
into
the
purest
and
most
sacred
arrangement
that
none
dare
question
or
criticize
yet
that
is
exactly
the
attitude
of
the
average
upholder
of
marriage
the
prospective
wife
and
mother
is
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
her
only
asset
in
the
competitive
field
sex
thus
she
enters
into
relations
with
a
man
only
to
find
herself
shocked
repelled
outraged
beyond
measure
by
the
most
natural
and
healthy
instinct
sex
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
unhappiness
misery
distress
and
physical
suffering
of
matrimony
is
due
to
the
criminal
ignorance
in
sex
matters
that
is
being
extolled
as
a
great
virtue
nor
is
it
at
all
an
exaggeration
when
i
say
that
more
than
one
home
has
been
broken
up
because
of
this
deplorable
fact
if
however
woman
is
free
and
big
enough
to
learn
the
mystery
of
sex
without
the
sanction
of
state
or
church
she
will
stand
condemned
as
utterly
unfit
to
become
the
wife
of
a
good
man
his
goodness
consisting
of
an
empty
brain
and
plenty
of
money
can
there
be
anything
more
outrageous
than
the
idea
that
a
healthy
grown
woman
full
of
life
and
passion
must
deny
nature
demand
must
subdue
her
most
intense
craving
undermine
her
health
and
break
her
spirit
must
stunt
her
vision
abstain
from
the
depth
and
glory
of
sex
experience
until
a
good
man
comes
along
to
take
her
unto
himself
as
a
wife
that
is
precisely
what
marriage
means
how
can
such
an
arrangement
end
except
in
failure
this
is
one
though
not
the
least
important
factor
of
marriage
which
differentiates
it
from
love
ours
is
a
practical
age
the
time
when
romeo
and
juliet
risked
the
wrath
of
their
fathers
for
love
when
gretchen
exposed
herself
to
the
gossip
of
her
neighbors
for
love
is
no
more
if
on
rare
occasions
young
people
allow
themselves
the
luxury
of
romance
they
are
taken
in
care
by
the
elders
drilled
and
pounded
until
they
become
sensible
the
moral
lesson
instilled
in
the
girl
is
not
whether
the
man
has
aroused
her
love
but
rather
is
it
how
much
the
important
and
only
god
of
practical
american
life
can
the
man
make
a
living
can
he
support
a
wife
that
is
the
only
thing
that
justifies
marriage
gradually
this
saturates
every
thought
of
the
girl
her
dreams
are
not
of
moonlight
and
kisses
of
laughter
and
tears
she
dreams
of
shopping
tours
and
bargain
counters
this
soul
poverty
and
sordidness
are
the
elements
inherent
in
the
marriage
institution
the
state
and
the
church
approve
of
no
other
ideal
simply
because
it
is
the
one
that
necessitates
the
state
and
church
control
of
men
and
women
doubtless
there
are
people
who
continue
to
consider
love
above
dollars
and
cents
particularly
is
this
true
of
that
class
whom
economic
necessity
has
forced
to
become
the
tremendous
change
in
woman
position
wrought
by
that
mighty
factor
is
indeed
phenomenal
when
we
reflect
that
it
is
but
a
short
time
since
she
has
entered
the
industrial
arena
six
million
women
wage
workers
six
million
women
who
have
the
equal
right
with
men
to
be
exploited
to
be
robbed
to
go
on
strike
aye
to
starve
even
anything
more
my
lord
yes
six
million
wage
workers
in
every
walk
of
life
from
the
highest
brain
work
to
the
mines
and
railroad
tracks
yes
even
detectives
and
policemen
surely
the
emancipation
is
complete
yet
with
all
that
but
a
very
small
number
of
the
vast
army
of
women
wage
workers
look
upon
work
as
a
permanent
issue
in
the
same
light
as
does
man
no
matter
how
decrepit
the
latter
he
has
been
taught
to
be
independent
oh
i
know
that
no
one
is
really
independent
in
our
economic
treadmill
still
the
poorest
specimen
of
a
man
hates
to
be
a
parasite
to
be
known
as
such
at
any
rate
the
woman
considers
her
position
as
worker
transitory
to
be
thrown
aside
for
the
first
bidder
that
is
why
it
is
infinitely
harder
to
organize
women
than
men
why
should
i
join
a
union
i
am
going
to
get
married
to
have
a
home
has
she
not
been
taught
from
infancy
to
look
upon
that
as
her
ultimate
calling
she
learns
soon
enough
that
the
home
though
not
so
large
a
prison
as
the
factory
has
more
solid
doors
and
bars
it
has
a
keeper
so
faithful
that
naught
can
escape
him
the
most
tragic
part
however
is
that
the
home
no
longer
frees
her
from
wage
slavery
it
only
increases
her
task
according
to
the
latest
statistics
submitted
before
a
committee
on
labor
and
wages
and
congestion
of
population
ten
per
cent
of
the
wage
workers
in
new
york
city
alone
are
married
yet
they
must
continue
to
work
at
the
most
poorly
paid
labor
in
the
world
add
to
this
horrible
aspect
the
drudgery
of
housework
and
what
remains
of
the
protection
and
glory
of
the
home
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
the
girl
in
marriage
can
not
speak
of
her
home
since
it
is
the
man
who
creates
her
sphere
it
is
not
important
whether
the
husband
is
a
brute
or
a
darling
what
i
wish
to
prove
is
that
marriage
guarantees
woman
a
home
only
by
the
grace
of
her
husband
there
she
moves
about
in
home
year
after
year
until
her
aspect
of
life
and
human
affairs
becomes
as
flat
narrow
and
drab
as
her
surroundings
small
wonder
if
she
becomes
a
nag
petty
quarrelsome
gossipy
unbearable
thus
driving
the
man
from
the
house
she
could
not
go
if
she
wanted
to
there
is
no
place
to
go
besides
a
short
period
of
married
life
of
complete
surrender
of
all
faculties
absolutely
incapacitates
the
average
woman
for
the
outside
world
she
becomes
reckless
in
appearance
clumsy
in
her
movements
dependent
in
her
decisions
cowardly
in
her
judgment
a
weight
and
a
bore
which
most
men
grow
to
hate
and
despise
wonderfully
inspiring
atmosphere
for
the
bearing
of
life
is
it
not
but
the
child
how
is
it
to
be
protected
if
not
for
marriage
after
all
is
not
that
the
most
important
consideration
the
sham
the
hypocrisy
of
it
marriage
protecting
the
child
yet
thousands
of
children
destitute
and
homeless
marriage
protecting
the
child
yet
orphan
asylums
and
reformatories
overcrowded
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
keeping
busy
in
rescuing
the
little
victims
from
loving
parents
to
place
them
under
more
loving
care
the
gerry
society
oh
the
mockery
of
it
marriage
may
have
the
power
to
bring
the
horse
to
water
but
has
it
ever
made
him
drink
the
law
will
place
the
father
under
arrest
and
put
him
in
convict
clothes
but
has
that
ever
stilled
the
hunger
of
the
child
if
the
parent
has
no
work
or
if
he
hides
his
identity
what
does
marriage
do
then
it
invokes
the
law
to
bring
the
man
to
justice
to
put
him
safely
behind
closed
doors
his
labor
however
goes
not
to
the
child
but
to
the
state
the
child
receives
but
a
blighted
memory
of
its
father
stripes
as
to
the
protection
of
the
woman
therein
lies
the
curse
of
marriage
not
that
it
really
protects
her
but
the
very
idea
is
so
revolting
such
an
outrage
and
insult
on
life
so
degrading
to
human
dignity
as
to
forever
condemn
this
parasitic
institution
it
is
like
that
other
paternal
arrangement
capitalism
it
robs
man
of
his
birthright
stunts
his
growth
poisons
his
body
keeps
him
in
ignorance
in
poverty
and
dependence
and
then
institutes
charities
that
thrive
on
the
last
vestige
of
man
the
institution
of
marriage
makes
a
parasite
of
woman
an
absolute
dependent
it
incapacitates
her
for
life
struggle
annihilates
her
social
consciousness
paralyzes
her
imagination
and
then
imposes
its
gracious
protection
which
is
in
reality
a
snare
a
travesty
on
human
character
if
motherhood
is
the
highest
fulfillment
of
woman
nature
what
other
protection
does
it
need
save
love
and
freedom
marriage
but
defiles
outrages
and
corrupts
her
fulfillment
does
it
not
say
to
woman
only
when
you
follow
me
shall
you
bring
forth
life
does
it
not
condemn
her
to
the
block
does
it
not
degrade
and
shame
her
if
she
refuses
to
buy
her
right
to
motherhood
by
selling
herself
does
not
marriage
only
sanction
motherhood
even
though
conceived
in
hatred
in
compulsion
yet
if
motherhood
be
of
free
choice
of
love
of
ecstasy
of
defiant
passion
does
it
not
place
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
an
innocent
head
and
carve
in
letters
of
blood
the
hideous
epithet
bastard
were
marriage
to
contain
all
the
virtues
claimed
for
it
its
crimes
against
motherhood
would
exclude
it
forever
from
the
realm
of
love
love
the
strongest
and
deepest
element
in
all
life
the
harbinger
of
hope
of
joy
of
ecstasy
love
the
defier
of
all
laws
of
all
conventions
love
the
freest
the
most
powerful
moulder
of
human
destiny
how
can
such
an
force
be
synonymous
with
that
poor
little
state
and
weed
marriage
free
love
as
if
love
is
anything
but
free
man
has
bought
brains
but
all
the
millions
in
the
world
have
failed
to
buy
love
man
has
subdued
bodies
but
all
the
power
on
earth
has
been
unable
to
subdue
love
man
has
conquered
whole
nations
but
all
his
armies
could
not
conquer
love
man
has
chained
and
fettered
the
spirit
but
he
has
been
utterly
helpless
before
love
high
on
a
throne
with
all
the
splendor
and
pomp
his
gold
can
command
man
is
yet
poor
and
desolate
if
love
passes
him
by
and
if
it
stays
the
poorest
hovel
is
radiant
with
warmth
with
life
and
color
thus
love
has
the
magic
power
to
make
of
a
beggar
a
king
yes
love
is
free
it
can
dwell
in
no
other
atmosphere
in
freedom
it
gives
itself
unreservedly
abundantly
completely
all
the
laws
on
the
statutes
all
the
courts
in
the
universe
can
not
tear
it
from
the
soil
once
love
has
taken
root
if
however
the
soil
is
sterile
how
can
marriage
make
it
bear
fruit
it
is
like
the
last
desperate
struggle
of
fleeting
life
against
death
love
needs
no
protection
it
is
its
own
protection
so
long
as
love
begets
life
no
child
is
deserted
or
hungry
or
famished
for
the
want
of
affection
i
know
this
to
be
true
i
know
women
who
became
mothers
in
freedom
by
the
men
they
loved
few
children
in
wedlock
enjoy
the
care
the
protection
the
devotion
free
motherhood
is
capable
of
bestowing
the
defenders
of
authority
dread
the
advent
of
a
free
motherhood
lest
it
will
rob
them
of
their
prey
who
would
fight
wars
who
would
create
wealth
who
would
make
the
policeman
the
jailer
if
woman
were
to
refuse
the
indiscriminate
breeding
of
children
the
race
the
race
shouts
the
king
the
president
the
capitalist
the
priest
the
race
must
be
preserved
though
woman
be
degraded
to
a
mere
machine
and
the
marriage
institution
is
our
only
safety
valve
against
the
pernicious
sex
awakening
of
woman
but
in
vain
these
frantic
efforts
to
maintain
a
state
of
bondage
in
vain
too
the
edicts
of
the
church
the
mad
attacks
of
rulers
in
vain
even
the
arm
of
the
law
woman
no
longer
wants
to
be
a
party
to
the
production
of
a
race
of
sickly
feeble
decrepit
wretched
human
beings
who
have
neither
the
strength
nor
moral
courage
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
poverty
and
slavery
instead
she
desires
fewer
and
better
children
begotten
and
reared
in
love
and
through
free
choice
not
by
compulsion
as
marriage
imposes
our
have
yet
to
learn
the
deep
sense
of
responsibility
toward
the
child
that
love
in
freedom
has
awakened
in
the
breast
of
woman
rather
would
she
forego
forever
the
glory
of
motherhood
than
bring
forth
life
in
an
atmosphere
that
breathes
only
destruction
and
death
and
if
she
does
become
a
mother
it
is
to
give
to
the
child
the
deepest
and
best
her
being
can
yield
to
grow
with
the
child
is
her
motto
she
knows
that
in
that
manner
alone
can
she
help
build
true
manhood
and
womanhood
ibsen
must
have
had
a
vision
of
a
free
mother
when
with
a
master
stroke
he
portrayed
alving
she
was
the
ideal
mother
because
she
had
outgrown
marriage
and
all
its
horrors
because
she
had
broken
her
chains
and
set
her
spirit
free
to
soar
until
it
returned
a
personality
regenerated
and
strong
alas
it
was
too
late
to
rescue
her
life
joy
her
oswald
but
not
too
late
to
realize
that
love
in
freedom
is
the
only
condition
of
a
beautiful
life
those
who
like
alving
have
paid
with
blood
and
tears
for
their
spiritual
awakening
repudiate
marriage
as
an
imposition
a
shallow
empty
mockery
they
know
whether
love
last
but
one
brief
span
of
time
or
for
eternity
it
is
the
only
creative
inspiring
elevating
basis
for
a
new
race
a
new
world
in
our
present
pygmy
state
love
is
indeed
a
stranger
to
most
people
misunderstood
and
shunned
it
rarely
takes
root
or
if
it
does
it
soon
withers
and
dies
its
delicate
fiber
can
not
endure
the
stress
and
strain
of
the
daily
grind
its
soul
is
too
complex
to
adjust
itself
to
the
slimy
woof
of
our
social
fabric
it
weeps
and
moans
and
suffers
with
those
who
have
need
of
it
yet
lack
the
capacity
to
rise
to
summit
some
day
some
day
men
and
women
will
rise
they
will
reach
the
mountain
peak
they
will
meet
big
and
strong
and
free
ready
to
receive
to
partake
and
to
bask
in
the
golden
rays
of
love
what
fancy
what
imagination
what
poetic
genius
can
foresee
even
approximately
the
potentialities
of
such
a
force
in
the
life
of
men
and
women
if
the
world
is
ever
to
give
birth
to
true
companionship
and
oneness
not
marriage
but
love
