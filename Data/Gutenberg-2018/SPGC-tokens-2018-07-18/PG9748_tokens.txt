the
old
gray
homestead
by
frances
parkinson
keyes
to
the
farmers
and
their
mothers
wives
and
daughters
who
have
been
my
nearest
neighbors
and
my
best
friends
for
the
last
fifteen
years
and
who
have
taught
me
to
love
the
country
and
the
people
in
it
this
quiet
story
of
a
farm
is
affectionately
and
gratefully
dedicated
the
old
gray
homestead
chapter
i
for
heaven
sake
sally
do
say
it
hot
or
you
ever
know
such
weather
for
april
or
it
seem
as
if
the
mud
was
just
as
bad
as
it
used
to
be
before
we
had
the
state
road
again
it
hot
i
never
did
see
such
weather
the
mud
is
if
anything
said
all
this
several
times
and
if
you
ca
think
of
anything
more
interesting
to
talk
about
i
wish
you
keep
still
sally
gray
pushed
back
the
lock
of
crinkly
brown
hair
that
was
always
getting
in
her
eyes
puckered
her
lips
a
little
and
glanced
at
her
brother
austin
without
replying
but
with
a
slight
ripple
of
concern
disturbing
her
usual
calm
she
was
plain
and
plump
and
placid
as
sweet
and
wholesome
as
clover
and
as
nerveless
as
a
cow
and
she
secretly
envied
her
brother
lean
dark
handsomeness
but
she
was
conscious
of
a
little
pang
of
regret
that
the
young
eager
face
beside
her
was
already
becoming
furrowed
with
lines
of
discontent
and
bitterness
and
that
the
expression
of
the
fine
mouth
was
rapidly
growing
more
and
more
hard
and
sullen
austin
had
been
all
the
way
from
hamstead
to
white
water
that
day
stopping
on
his
way
back
at
wallacetown
to
bring
sally
who
taught
school
there
home
for
over
sunday
his
little
old
horse
never
either
strong
or
swift
was
tired
and
hot
and
muddy
and
hung
its
unkempt
head
dejectedly
apparently
having
lost
all
willingness
to
drag
the
dilapidated
and
its
two
occupants
another
step
manner
sally
reflected
was
not
much
more
cheerful
than
that
of
his
horse
while
his
clothes
were
certainly
as
dirty
as
shabby
and
as
as
the
rest
of
his
equipage
it
a
shame
she
thought
that
austin
takes
everything
so
hard
the
rest
of
us
do
mind
half
so
much
if
he
could
only
have
a
little
bit
of
encouragement
and
help
something
that
would
make
him
really
happy
if
he
could
earn
some
money
or
find
out
that
after
all
money
everything
or
fall
in
love
with
some
nice
girl
she
checked
herself
blushing
and
sighing
the
blush
was
occasioned
by
her
own
quiet
happiness
in
that
direction
but
the
sigh
was
because
austin
though
he
was
well
known
to
have
been
rather
wild
never
paid
any
nice
girl
the
slightest
attention
and
jeered
cynically
at
the
mere
suggestion
that
he
should
do
so
how
lovely
the
valley
is
she
said
aloud
at
last
i
do
believe
there
a
prettier
stretch
of
road
in
the
whole
world
than
this
between
wallacetown
and
hamstead
especially
in
the
spring
when
the
river
is
so
high
and
everything
is
looking
so
fresh
and
green
fortunate
it
is
pretty
probably
it
the
only
thing
we
have
to
look
at
as
long
as
we
live
and
certainly
it
about
all
we
seen
so
far
if
there
been
only
you
and
i
sally
we
could
have
gone
off
to
school
and
maybe
to
college
too
but
with
eight
of
us
to
feed
and
clothe
it
no
wonder
that
father
is
dead
sunk
in
debt
certainly
i
sha
travel
much
he
added
laughing
bitterly
when
he
thinks
we
ca
have
even
one
hired
man
in
the
future
and
certainly
you
wo
either
if
you
fool
enough
to
marry
fred
and
go
straight
from
the
of
one
home
to
the
fire
of
another
oh
austin
it
wrong
of
you
to
talk
so
i
going
to
be
ever
so
happy
wrong
how
else
do
you
expect
me
to
talk
if
i
talk
at
all
does
it
mean
anything
to
you
that
the
farm
mortgaged
to
the
very
last
cent
and
that
it
does
begin
to
produce
what
it
ought
to
because
we
ca
beg
borrow
or
steal
the
money
that
ought
to
be
put
into
it
can
you
just
shut
your
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
house
the
finest
in
the
county
when
grandfather
gray
built
it
is
falling
to
pieces
for
want
of
necessary
repairs
and
look
at
our
barns
and
sheds
or
do
look
at
them
if
you
can
help
it
does
it
gall
you
to
dress
as
you
do
because
you
have
to
turn
over
most
of
what
you
can
earn
teaching
to
the
family
of
course
you
never
can
earn
much
because
you
have
had
a
good
enough
education
yourself
to
get
a
position
so
that
the
younger
girls
can
go
to
school
at
all
instead
of
going
out
as
hired
help
ca
you
feel
the
injustice
of
being
poor
and
dirty
and
ignorant
when
thousands
of
other
people
are
just
with
money
i
heard
of
such
people
but
i
never
met
any
of
them
around
here
returned
his
sister
quietly
we
no
worse
off
than
lots
of
people
better
off
than
some
i
think
we
got
a
good
deal
to
be
thankful
for
living
where
we
can
see
green
things
growing
and
being
well
and
having
a
mother
like
ours
i
wish
you
could
come
to
feel
that
way
perhaps
you
will
some
day
why
do
you
marry
fred
cousin
instead
of
fred
asked
her
brother
changing
the
subject
abruptly
you
could
get
him
just
as
easy
as
not
i
could
see
that
when
he
was
here
last
summer
then
you
could
go
to
boston
to
live
get
something
out
of
life
yourself
and
help
your
family
too
no
one
in
the
family
but
you
would
want
help
from
me
at
that
price
returned
sally
still
speaking
quietly
but
betraying
by
the
slight
unevenness
of
her
voice
that
her
quiet
spirit
was
at
last
disturbed
more
than
she
cared
to
show
why
austin
you
know
how
i
lo
care
for
fred
and
that
i
gave
him
my
word
more
than
two
years
ago
besides
i
heard
you
say
yourself
before
you
knew
he
fancied
me
that
hugh
elliott
drank
and
did
all
sorts
of
other
dreadful
things
he
would
be
considered
respectable
in
hamstead
austin
laughed
again
all
right
i
wo
bring
up
the
subject
again
ten
years
from
now
you
may
be
sorry
you
would
put
up
with
an
occasional
spree
and
sacrifice
a
silly
little
for
the
sake
of
everything
else
you
get
but
suit
yourself
cook
and
wash
and
iron
and
scrub
lose
your
color
and
your
figure
and
your
disposition
and
bring
children
into
the
world
with
no
better
heritage
than
that
if
it
your
idea
of
bliss
and
it
seems
to
be
i
did
mean
to
be
cross
sally
he
said
after
they
had
driven
along
in
heavy
silence
for
some
minutes
i
been
trying
to
do
a
little
business
for
father
in
white
water
and
met
with
my
usual
run
of
luck
none
at
all
here
comes
one
of
the
teams
ploughing
towards
us
through
the
mud
who
in
it
do
you
suppose
does
look
familiar
some
way
as
the
in
hamstead
boasted
only
four
it
was
not
strange
that
austin
recognized
one
of
them
at
sight
and
as
strangers
were
few
and
far
between
they
were
objects
of
considerable
interest
sally
leaned
forward
no
she
does
she
all
in
black
and
my
is
she
pretty
she
seems
to
be
stopping
and
looking
around
why
do
you
ask
her
if
you
could
be
of
any
help
austin
nodded
and
pulled
in
his
reins
i
wonder
if
i
could
he
began
but
stopped
abruptly
realizing
that
the
lady
in
the
buggy
coming
towards
them
had
also
stopped
and
spoken
the
very
same
words
inevitably
they
all
smiled
and
the
stranger
began
again
i
wonder
if
you
could
tell
me
how
to
get
to
howard
gray
house
she
said
i
was
told
at
the
hotel
to
drive
along
this
road
as
far
as
a
large
white
house
the
first
one
i
came
to
and
then
turn
to
the
right
but
i
do
see
any
road
there
is
any
at
this
time
of
year
said
sally
laughing
nothing
but
mud
you
have
to
wallow
through
that
field
and
go
up
a
hill
and
down
a
hill
and
along
a
little
farther
and
then
you
come
to
the
house
just
follow
us
we
going
there
i
howard
gray
eldest
daughter
sally
and
this
is
my
brother
austin
oh
then
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
before
i
intrude
if
it
would
be
any
use
whether
you
think
that
possibly
whether
under
any
circumstances
well
if
your
mother
would
be
good
enough
to
let
me
come
and
live
at
her
house
a
little
while
by
this
time
sally
and
austin
had
both
realized
two
things
first
that
the
person
with
whom
they
were
talking
belonged
to
quite
a
different
world
from
their
own
the
fact
was
written
large
in
her
clothing
in
her
manner
in
the
very
tones
of
her
voice
and
second
that
in
spite
of
her
pale
face
and
widow
veil
she
was
even
younger
than
they
were
a
girl
hardly
out
of
her
teens
i
not
very
well
she
went
on
rapidly
before
they
could
answer
and
my
doctor
told
me
to
go
away
to
some
quiet
place
in
the
country
until
i
could
get
get
rested
a
little
i
spent
a
summer
here
with
my
mother
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
i
remembered
how
lovely
it
was
and
so
i
came
back
but
the
hotel
has
run
down
so
that
i
do
think
i
can
possibly
stay
there
and
yet
i
ca
bear
to
go
away
from
this
beautiful
peaceful
it
just
what
i
been
longing
to
find
i
happened
to
overhear
some
one
talking
about
gray
and
saying
that
she
might
consider
taking
me
in
so
i
hired
this
buggy
and
started
out
to
find
her
and
ask
oh
do
you
think
she
would
sally
and
austin
exchanged
glances
mother
never
has
taken
any
boarders
she
always
been
too
busy
began
the
former
then
seeing
the
swift
look
of
disappointment
on
the
sad
little
face
but
she
might
it
would
do
any
harm
to
ask
anyway
we
drive
ahead
and
show
you
how
to
get
there
the
gray
family
had
been
one
of
local
prominence
ever
since
colonial
days
and
james
gray
who
built
the
dignified
spacious
homestead
now
occupied
by
his
grandson
family
had
been
a
man
of
some
education
and
wealth
his
son
thomas
inherited
the
house
but
only
a
fourth
of
the
fortune
as
he
had
three
sisters
thomas
had
but
one
child
howard
whose
prospects
for
prosperity
seemed
excellent
but
he
grew
up
a
dreamy
irresolute
studious
chap
a
striking
contrast
to
the
sturdy
yeoman
type
from
which
he
had
sprung
one
of
those
freaks
of
heredity
that
are
hard
to
explain
he
went
to
dartmouth
college
travelled
a
little
showed
a
disposition
to
read
and
even
to
write
verses
as
a
teacher
he
probably
would
have
been
successful
but
his
father
was
determined
that
he
should
become
a
farmer
and
howard
had
neither
the
energy
nor
the
disposition
to
oppose
him
he
proved
a
complete
failure
he
married
young
and
it
was
generally
considered
beneath
him
for
mary
austin
with
a
heart
of
gold
and
a
disposition
like
sunshine
had
little
wealth
or
breeding
and
less
education
to
commend
her
and
she
was
herself
too
and
contented
to
prove
the
prod
that
howard
sadly
needed
in
his
wife
children
came
thick
and
fast
the
eldest
james
had
now
gone
south
the
second
daughter
ruth
was
already
married
to
a
struggling
storekeeper
living
in
white
water
sally
taught
school
but
the
others
were
all
still
at
home
and
all
except
austin
too
young
to
be
thomas
molly
katherine
and
edith
they
had
all
caught
their
father
facility
for
correct
speech
rare
in
northern
new
england
most
of
them
his
love
of
books
his
formless
and
unfulfilled
ambitions
more
than
one
the
shiftlessness
and
incompetence
that
come
partly
from
natural
bent
and
partly
from
hopelessness
while
sally
and
thomas
alone
possessed
the
sunny
disposition
and
the
ability
to
see
the
bright
side
of
everything
and
the
good
in
everybody
which
was
their
mother
legacy
to
them
the
old
house
set
well
back
from
the
main
road
and
near
the
river
with
elms
and
maples
and
clumps
of
lilac
bushes
about
it
was
almost
bare
of
the
cheerful
white
paint
that
had
once
adorned
it
and
the
green
blinds
were
faded
and
broken
the
barns
never
had
been
painted
and
were
huddled
close
to
the
house
hiding
its
fine
colonial
lines
black
ungainly
and
half
fallen
to
pieces
all
kinds
of
farm
implements
rusty
from
age
and
neglect
were
scattered
about
and
two
dogs
and
several
cats
lay
on
the
kitchen
porch
amidst
the
general
litter
of
chairs
and
rush
mats
there
was
no
one
in
sight
as
the
two
muddy
buggies
pulled
up
at
the
front
door
howard
gray
and
thomas
were
milking
both
somewhat
because
of
the
of
austin
for
there
were
too
many
cows
for
them
to
manage
alone
a
long
row
of
dirty
lean
animals
of
uncertain
age
and
breed
molly
was
helping
her
mother
to
get
supper
and
the
red
tablecloth
and
heavy
white
china
never
removed
from
the
kitchen
table
except
to
be
washed
were
beginning
to
be
heaped
with
pickles
doughnuts
pie
and
cake
and
there
were
potatoes
and
pork
frying
on
the
stove
katherine
was
studying
and
edith
had
gone
to
hastily
spread
up
the
beds
that
had
not
been
made
that
morning
on
the
whole
however
the
inside
of
the
house
was
more
tidy
than
the
outside
and
the
girl
in
black
was
aware
of
the
homely
comfort
and
good
cheer
of
the
into
which
she
was
ushered
since
there
was
no
time
to
open
up
the
cold
parlor
more
than
she
was
of
its
shabbiness
come
right
in
an
set
down
said
gray
cheerfully
leading
the
way
awful
tryin
weather
we
havin
ai
it
an
the
mud
my
somethin
fierce
the
track
it
in
so
there
no
keepin
it
swept
up
an
there
so
many
of
us
here
but
there
nothin
like
a
large
family
for
keepin
things
hummin
just
the
same
now
is
there
gray
had
had
scant
time
to
prepare
her
mind
either
for
her
unexpected
visitor
or
the
object
of
her
visit
but
her
was
ready
for
all
that
one
glance
at
the
slight
little
figure
and
the
thin
white
face
with
its
tired
eyes
was
enough
for
her
here
was
need
of
help
and
therefore
help
of
some
sort
she
must
certainly
give
now
then
she
went
on
quickly
you
look
just
plum
tuckered
out
set
down
an
rest
a
spell
an
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
my
name
is
sylvia
cary
mortimer
cary
i
mean
she
shivered
paused
and
went
on
i
live
in
new
york
that
is
i
always
have
never
going
to
any
more
if
i
can
help
it
my
husband
died
two
months
ago
my
baby
just
before
that
i
felt
so
so
tired
ever
since
i
just
had
to
get
away
somewhere
away
from
the
noise
and
the
hurry
and
the
crowds
of
people
i
know
i
was
in
hamstead
once
ten
years
ago
and
i
remembered
it
and
came
back
i
want
most
dreadfully
to
stay
could
you
possibly
make
room
for
me
here
oh
you
poor
lamb
i
do
anything
i
could
for
you
but
this
ai
the
sort
of
home
you
been
used
to
began
gray
but
she
was
interrupted
no
no
of
course
it
is
do
you
understand
i
ca
bear
what
been
used
to
another
minute
and
i
honestly
try
not
to
be
a
bit
of
trouble
if
you
only
let
me
stay
gray
twisted
in
her
chair
fingering
her
apron
well
now
i
do
know
you
come
so
if
i
only
had
a
little
notice
there
no
place
fit
for
a
lady
like
you
but
there
are
two
rooms
we
never
use
the
northeast
parlor
and
the
off
it
you
could

do
you
mrs
cary
she
bustled
ahead
pulling
up
the
shades
and
flinging
open
the
windows
in
the
unused
rooms
my
but
the
dust
is
thick
do
you
touch
a
thing
just
see
if
you
think
they
do
sylvia
cary
glanced
quickly
about
the
two
great
square
rooms
with
their
white
wainscotting
and
shutters
their
large
fireplaces
dingy
and
beautiful
neglected
furniture
indeed
they
will
she
exclaimed
they
be
lovely
when
we
get
them
fixed
and
may
i
truly
stay
right
now
i
brought
my
with
me
you
see
hoping
that
i
might
and
my
trunks
are
still
at
the
station
wait
i
give
you
the
checks
and
perhaps
your
son
will
get
them
after
supper
she
put
the
bag
on
a
chair
and
began
to
open
it
hurriedly
as
if
unwilling
to
wait
a
minute
longer
before
making
sure
of
remaining
gray
who
was
standing
near
her
drew
back
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
the
bag
was
lined
with
heavy
purple
silk
and
elaborately
fitted
with
toilet
articles
of
shining
gold
cary
plunged
her
hands
in
and
tossed
out
an
embroidered
white
satin
negligee
a
pair
of
white
satin
and
a
nightgown
that
was
a
mere
wisp
of
sheer
silk
and
lace
then
drew
forth
three
and
a
bundle
an
inch
thick
of
crisp
new
and
pulled
one
out
blushing
and
hesitating
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
taking
me
in
she
said
some
day
i
tell
you
all
about
myself
and
why
it
means
so
much
to
me
to
have
a
a
refuge
like
this
but
i
afraid
i
ca
until
got
rested
a
little
soon
we
must
talk
about
arrangements
and
terms
and
all
that
oh
i
awfully
businesslike
but
just
let
me
give
you
this
to
show
you
how
grateful
i
am
and
pay
for
the
first
two
weeks
or
so
and
she
folded
the
bill
into
a
tiny
square
and
crushed
it
into
gray
reluctant
hand
fifteen
minutes
later
when
howard
gray
and
thomas
came
into
the
kitchen
for
their
supper
bringing
the
last
full
with
them
they
found
the
pork
and
potatoes
burnt
to
a
frazzle
the
girls
all
talking
at
once
and
austin
bending
over
his
mother
who
sat
in
the
big
rocker
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
and
a
bill
spread
out
on
her
lap
chapter
ii
for
several
weeks
the
grays
did
not
see
much
of
cary
she
appeared
at
dinner
and
supper
eating
little
and
saying
less
she
rose
very
late
having
a
cup
of
coffee
in
bed
about
ten
the
afternoons
she
spent
rambling
through
the
fields
and
along
the
but
never
going
near
the
highroad
on
her
long
walks
she
generally
read
until
nearly
midnight
and
the
grays
pounced
like
tigers
on
the
newspapers
and
magazines
with
which
she
heaped
her
and
longed
for
the
time
to
come
when
she
would
offer
to
lend
them
some
of
the
books
piled
high
all
around
her
rooms
some
years
before
when
vacationists
demanded
less
in
the
way
of
amusement
hamstead
had
flourished
in
a
mild
way
as
a
but
its
brief
day
of
prosperity
in
this
respect
had
passed
and
the
advent
of
a
wealthy
and
mysterious
stranger
whose
mail
was
larger
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
population
put
together
but
who
never
appeared
in
public
or
even
spoke
apparently
in
private
threw
the
entire
village
into
a
ferment
of
excitement
fred
elliott
who
in
his
rôle
of
prospective
might
be
expected
to
know
much
that
was
going
on
at
the
grays
was
pumped
in
vain
he
was
obliged
to
confess
his
entire
ignorance
concerning
the
history
occupations
and
future
intentions
of
the
young
widow
gray
had
to
her
parlor
a
month
earlier
than
she
had
intended
because
she
had
so
many
callers
who
came
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
cary
and
hear
all
about
her
besides
but
they
did
not
see
her
at
all
and
gray
could
tell
them
but
little
she
ai
a
mite
of
trouble
the
good
woman
declared
to
every
one
the
simplest
gentlest
creature
i
ever
see
in
my
life
the
girls
are
all
just
crazy
over
her
no
she
ai
told
me
yet
anything
about
herself
an
i
do
like
to
press
her
none
poor
lamb
with
her
heart
buried
in
the
grave
at
her
age
no
i
do
know
how
long
she
means
to
stay
neither
but
be
a
good
while
if
i
had
my
way
to
elliott
her
best
friend
and
fred
mother
she
was
slightly
more
communicative
though
she
disclosed
no
vital
statistics
edith
helped
her
unpack
an
she
said
she
never
even
imagined
anything
equal
to
what
come
out
of
them
three
great
trunks
she
said
it
made
her
just
long
to
be
a
widow
the
dresses
was
all
black
of
course
but
they
had
an
awful
expensive
look
some
way
just
the
same
an
underclothes
edith
said
there
was
at
least
a
dozen
of
everything
an
two
dozen
of
most
lace
an
handwork
an
silk
from
one
end
of
to
the
other
she
has
a
leather
box
most
as
big
as
a
suitcase
heaped
with
jewelry
it
was
open
one
morning
when
i
went
in
with
her
breakfast
an
i
give
you
my
word
eliza
that
just
the
little
glimpse
i
got
of
it
was
worth
miles
to
see
an
yet
she
never
wears
so
much
as
the
simplest
ring
or
pin
she
has
enough
flowers
for
an
elegant
funeral
sent
to
her
three
times
a
week
by
express
an
throws
away
before
says
she
likes
the
little
wild
ones
that
are
beginnin
to
come
up
around
here
better
anyway
yes
i
do
deny
she
has
some
real
queer
notions
for
instance
she
puts
all
them
flowers
in
plain
green
glass
vases
an
would
so
much
as
look
at
the
elegant
ones
they
keep
up
to
wallacetown
she
do
eat
a
particle
of
breakfast
she
streaks
off
for
a
long
walk
every
day
rain
or
shine
an
wants
the
old
tin
tub
carried
in
so
she
can
have
a
hot
bath
every
single
night
besides
takin
what
she
calls
a
sponge
when
she
gets
up
in
the
mornin
which
ai
till
nearly
noon
well
now
ai
all
that
strange
an
would
i
admire
to
see
all
them
elegant
things
what
board
did
you
say
she
paid
dollars
a
week
for
board
an
washin
an
mendin
just
think
of
it
eliza
i
feel
like
a
robber
but
she
would
hear
of
a
cent
less
howard
wants
i
should
save
every
penny
so
at
least
one
of
the
younger
children
can
have
more
of
an
education
than
james
an
sally
an
austin
an
ruth
i
do
look
at
it
that
way
seems
to
me
it
ai
fair
to
give
one
child
more
than
another
i
want
to
spruce
up
this
place
a
little
lay
by
to
raise
the
mortgage
if
we
can
which
way

lot

time
i
can
see
her
you
an
joe
an
fred
all
come
to
dinner
on
sunday
then
you
will
elliott
accepted
with
alacrity
but
alas
for
the
eager
guests
when
sunday
came
cary
had
a
severe
headache
and
remained
in
bed
all
day
she
was
so
simple
and
gentle
as
gray
said
that
it
came
as
a
distinct
shock
when
it
was
discovered
that
little
as
she
talked
she
observed
a
great
deal
austin
was
the
first
member
of
the
family
to
find
this
out
all
the
others
had
gone
to
church
and
he
was
lounging
on
the
porch
one
sunday
morning
when
she
came
out
of
the
house
supposing
that
she
was
quite
alone
on
finding
him
there
she
hesitated
for
a
minute
and
then
sat
quietly
down
on
the
steps
made
one
or
two
pleasant
commonplace
remarks
and
lapsed
into
silence
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
looking
out
towards
the
barns
her
expression
was
but
austin
antagonistic
spirit
was
quick
to
judge
it
to
be
critical
i
suppose
you
travelled
a
good
deal
besides
living
in
new
york
he
said
in
the
bitter
tone
that
was
fast
becoming
his
usual
one
yes
to
a
certain
extent
i
been
around
the
world
once
and
to
europe
several
times
and
i
spent
part
of
last
winter
south
how
miserable
and
shabby
this
place
must
look
to
you
she
raised
her
head
and
leaned
back
against
a
post
looking
fixedly
at
him
for
a
minute
he
was
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
the
pale
face
was
extremely
lovely
that
the
great
dark
eyes
were
not
gray
as
he
had
supposed
but
a
very
deep
blue
and
that
the
slim
throat
and
neck
left
bare
by
the
dress
were
the
color
of
a
white
rose
a
swift
current
of
feeling
that
he
had
never
known
before
passed
through
him
like
an
electric
shock
bringing
him
involuntarily
to
his
feet
in
time
to
hear
her
say
it
shabby
but
it
is
miserable
i
do
believe
any
place
is
that
where
there
a
family
and
enough
food
to
eat
and
wood
to
burn
if
the
family
is
happy
in
itself
besides
with
two
hours
work
and
without
spending
one
cent
you
could
make
it
much
less
shabby
than
it
is
and
by
saving
what
you
already
have
you
could
stave
off
spending
in
the
future
she
pointed
as
she
spoke
to
the
cluttered
yard
before
them
to
the
unwashed
wagons
and
rusty
tools
that
had
not
been
put
away
to
the
half
off
its
hinges
and
the
unpiled
wood
tossed
carelessly
inside
the
shed
he
reddened
as
much
at
the
scorn
in
her
gesture
as
at
the
words
themselves
and
answered
angrily
as
many
persons
do
when
they
are
ashamed
that
very
true
but
when
you
work
just
as
hard
as
you
can
anyway
you
have
much
spirit
left
over
for
the
frills
excuse
me
i
did
realize
they
were
frills
no
business
man
would
have
his
office
in
an
untidy
condition
because
it
would
pay
i
should
think
it
would
pay
on
a
farm
either
just
as
it
seems
to
me
though
of
course
i
not
in
a
position
to
judge
that
if
you
sold
all
those
tubercular
grade
cows
and
bought
a
few
good
cattle
and
kept
them
clean
and
fed
them
well
you
get
more
milk
pay
less
for
grain
and
not
have
to
work
so
hard
looking
after
more
animals
than
you
can
really
handle
well
as
she
spoke
she
began
to
unfasten
her
long
frilled
black
sleeves
and
rose
with
a
smile
so
winning
that
it
entirely
robbed
her
speech
of
sharpness
let
go
to
work
she
said
and
see
how
much
we
could
do
in
the
way
of
making
things
look
better
before
the
others
get
home
from
church
start
here
hand
me
that
broom
and
i
sweep
while
you
stack
up
the
do
stop
to
reason
with
me
about
it
that
only
use
up
time
if
there
any
hot
water
on
the
kitchen
stove
and
you
know
where
the
mop
is
i
wash
this
porch
as
well
as
sweep
it
put
on
some
more
water
to
heat
if
you
take
all
there
is
when
the
grays
returned
from
church
their
astonished
eyes
were
met
with
the
spectacle
of
their
boarder
her
cheeks
glowing
her
hair
half
down
her
back
and
her
silk
dress
irretrievably
ruined
helping
austin
to
wash
and
oil
the
one
wagon
which
still
stood
in
the
yard
she
fled
at
their
approach
leaving
austin
to
retail
her
conversation
and
explain
her
conduct
as
best
he
could
and
to
ponder
over
both
all
the
afternoon
himself
she
dead
right
about
the
cows
declared
thomas
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
getting
good
stock
and
putting
it
in
these
barns
it
would
sicken
in
no
time
we
need
new
buildings
with
proper
ventilation
and
concrete
floors
and
a
silo
why
do
you
say
we
need
a
million
dollars
and
be
done
with
it
you
might
just
as
well
retorted
his
brother
because
we
do
but
we
need
about
ten
thousand
half
of
it
for
buildings
and
the
rest
for
stock
and
utensils
and
fertilizers
and
for
what
it
would
cost
to
clean
up
our
stumpy
old
pastures
and
make
them
worth
something
again
at
that
moment
cary
entered
the
room
for
dinner
and
the
discussion
of
unpossessed
resources
came
to
an
abrupt
end
her
color
was
still
high
and
she
ate
her
first
hearty
meal
since
her
arrival
but
her
dress
and
her
hair
were
irreproachably
demure
again
and
she
talked
even
less
than
usual
that
evening
molly
begged
off
from
doing
her
share
with
the
dishes
and
went
to
play
on
her
newly
tuned
piano
she
loved
music
dearly
and
had
genuine
talent
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
never
realized
half
so
keenly
before
how
little
she
knew
about
it
and
how
much
she
needed
help
and
instruction
a
particularly
unsuccessful
struggle
with
a
difficult
passage
finally
proved
too
much
for
her
courage
and
shutting
the
piano
with
a
bang
she
leaned
her
head
on
it
and
burst
out
crying
a
moment
later
she
sat
up
with
a
sudden
jerk
realizing
that
the
parlor
door
had
opened
and
closed
and
tried
to
wipe
away
the
tears
before
any
one
saw
them
then
a
hot
blush
of
embarrassment
and
shame
flooded
her
wet
cheeks
as
she
realized
that
the
intruder
was
not
one
of
her
sisters
but
cary
what
a
good
touch
you
have
she
said
sitting
down
by
the
piano
and
apparently
quite
unaware
of
the
storm
i
love
music
dearly
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
let
me
come
and
listen
to
your
playing
for
a
little
while
the
fingering
of
that
is
awfully
hard
is
it
i
thought
i
should
never
get
it
myself
never
did
really
well
in
fact
do
you
like
your
teacher
i
never
had
a
lesson
in
my
life
replied
molly
the
sobs
rising
in
her
throat
again
there
are
two
good
ones
in
wallacetown
but
you
see
we
never
could
af
well
some
teachers
do
more
harm
than
good
interrupted
her
visitor
probably
you
escaped
a
great
deal
play
something
else
wo
you
do
you
mind
this
dim
light
i
like
it
so
much
so
molly
opened
the
piano
and
began
again
doing
her
very
best
she
chose
the
simple
things
she
knew
by
heart
and
put
all
her
as
well
as
all
her
skill
into
playing
them
well
it
was
only
when
she
stopped
confessing
that
she
knew
no
more
that
gary
stirred
i
used
to
play
a
good
deal
myself
she
said
speaking
very
low
perhaps
i
could
take
it
up
again
do
you
think
you
could
help
me
molly
help
however
in
the
world
by
letting
be
your
teacher
i
getting
rested
now
and
i
find
a
lot
of
superfluous
energy
at
my
disposal
your
brother
had
a
dose
of
it
this
morning
i
want
something
to
do
something
to
keep
me
busy
something
to
keep
me
from
thinking
i
have
half
as
much
talent
as
you
but
i
had
more
chances
to
learn
listen
this
is
the
way
that
ought
to
go
and
cary
began
to
play
the
dusk
turned
to
moonlight
around
them
and
the
grays
sat
in
the
hesitating
to
intrude
and
listening
with
all
their
ears
and
still
she
sat
talking
explaining
illustrating
to
molly
and
finally
ended
by
playing
one
after
another
the
old
familiar
hymns
which
they
all
loved
it
settled
then
i
give
you
your
first
real
lesson
and
send
to
new
york
at
once
for
music
you
have
to
do
lots
of
scales
and
i
warn
you
now
come
into
parlor
something
else
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
do
you
see
that
great
trunk
she
went
on
after
she
had
drawn
molly
in
after
her
and
lighted
the
lamp
i
sent
for
it
a
week
ago
but
it
only
got
here
yesterday
it
full
of
all
my
all
the
clothes
i
had
to
stop
wearing
a
little
while
ago
molly
heart
began
to
thump
with
excitement
you
and
edith
are
little
like
me
whispered
cary
if
you
would
take
the
dresses
and
use
them
it
would
be
be
such
a
to
me
some
of
them
are
some
of
them
would
be
useful
or
suitable
for
you
but
there
are
firms
in
every
big
city
that
buy
such
things
so
you
could
sell
those
if
you
care
to
and
besides
the
clothes
there
are
several
a
piece
of
pink
silk
that
would
be
sweet
for
sally
and
some
embroidered
linens
and
and
so
on
i
going
to
bed
now
i
had
so
much
exercise
and
you
given
me
such
a
pleasant
evening
that
i
sha
have
to
read
myself
to
sleep
and
when
i
shut
my
bedroom
door
if
you
truly
would
like
the
trunk
have
your
brothers
come
in
and
carry
it
off
and
promise
me
never
never
to
speak
about
it
again
monday
and
tuesday
passed
by
without
further
excitement
but
wednesday
morning
while
gray
was
planting
his
newly
ploughed
cary
sauntered
out
and
sat
down
beside
the
place
where
he
was
working
apparently
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
damp
ground
is
supposed
to
be
as
detrimental
to
feminine
wearing
apparel
as
it
is
to
feminine
constitutions
i
been
watching
you
from
the
window
as
long
as
i
could
stand
it
she
said
now
i
come
to
beg
i
want
a
garden
too
a
do
you
mind
if
i
dig
up
your
front
yard
he
laughed
supposing
that
she
was
joking
dig
all
you
want
to
he
said
i
do
believe
you
do
much
harm
thanks
i
try
not
to
have
i
your
full
permission
to
try
my
hand
and
see
you
certainly
have
is
there
some
boy
in
the
village
i
could
hire
to
do
the
first
heavy
work
and
the
mowing
and
pull
up
the
weeds
from
time
to
time
if
they
get
ahead
of
me
howard
gray
leaned
on
his
hoe
you
do
need
to
hire
a
boy
he
said
gravely
we
be
only
too
glad
to
help
you
all
you
need
thank
you
but
you
see
you
got
too
much
to
do
already
and
i
add
to
your
burdens
or
feel
free
to
ask
favors
unless
you
let
me
do
it
in
a
business
way
gray
turned
his
hoe
over
and
began
to
hack
at
the
ground
i
see
how
you
feel
he
began
but
if
thomas
could
do
it
evenings
at
whatever
the
rate
is
around
here
by
the
hour
i
should
be
very
glad
if
not
please
find
me
a
boy
she
has
a
way
of
saying
things
explained
howard
gray
who
had
faltered
along
in
a
state
of
dreary
indecision
for
nearly
sixty
years
in
telling
his
wife
about
it
afterwards
as
if
they
were
all
settled
already
what
could
i
say
but
cary
and
then
she
went
on
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
long
as
you
got
an
extra
stall
may
i
send
for
one
of
my
horses
the
usual
board
around
here
is
five
dollars
a
week
is
it
and
what
could
i
say
again
but
cary
though
you
may
believe
i
fairly
itched
to
ask
and
the
love
of
heaven
how
horses
have
you
i
could
stand
her
actin
as
if
things
was
all
settled
replied
his
wife
i
like
to
see
folks
up
an
comin
even
if
i
ai
made
that
way
myself
an
it
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
see
the
poor
child
kinder
pickin
up
an
takin
notice
again
but
what
beats
me
is
she
acts
as
if
all
these
things
were
special
favors
to
the
garden
an
the
horse
is
all
very
well
but
what
do
you
think
she
lit
into
me
for
let
me
stay
all
summer
wo
you
mrs
gray
she
said
into
the
kitchen
where
i
was
ironin
away
for
dear
life
liftin
a
pile
of
sheets
off
a
chair
an
settlin
down
your
heart
you
can
stay
forever
as
far
as
i
concerned
says
i
perhaps
i
will
says
she
leanin
back
an
laughin
she
got
a
laugh
hev
you
noticed
howard
so
you
wo
think
or
discontented
if
i
suggest
a
few
little
changes
i
like
to
make
around
will
you
i
know
it
awfully
bold
in
another
house
an
such
a
house
too
but
well
demanded
her
husband
as
she
paused
for
breath
well
howard
gray
the
first
of
them
little
changes
is
to
be
a
great
big
piazza
to
go
across
the
whole
front
of
the
house
kitchen
porch
is
so
small
an
crowded
says
she

there
i
want
a
place

sit
out
evenings
ca
i
have
the
fireplaces
in
my
rooms
unbricked
she
went
on
the
rooms
an
painted
an
oh

never
lived
in
a
house
where
there
was
a
bathroom
before
an
i
want
to
make
that
big
closet
with
a
window
off
my
bedroom
into
one
we
have
a
door
cut
through
it
into
the
hall
too
says
she
is
there
a
closet
just
like
it
overhead
if
we
can
get
a
plumber
here
they
such
slippery
customers
he
might
as
well
put
in
two
bathrooms
as
one
while
he
about
it
an
you
sha
do
my
great
washin
any
more
without
some
good

gray
kerosene

electrician

around
here
cary
says
i
an
angel
right
out
of
heaven
but
we
ca
accept
all
this
from
you

two
thousand
dollars

two
months
for
my
living
expenses
anywhere

she

an
she

thomas

eighth
wonder
of
the
world
said
his
father

just
wind
him
around

little
finger

his
wife
an
we
waitin

so
all
except

austin
mad
as
a
hatter
at
what
she

morning
he
does
like
her
mary
humph
said
his
wife
chapter
iii
gray
i
going
for
a
ride
dearie
sure
it
ai
too
hot
not
a
bit
it
rained
so
hard
all
this
week
that
i
have
had
a
bit
of
exercise
and
i
getting
cross
cross
i
like
to
see
you
once
it
still
looks
kinder
thunderous
to
me
off
in
the
west
so
do
go
far
i
wo
i
promise
i
be
back
by
there
austin
just
up
from
the
hayfield
i
get
him
to
saddle
for
me
and
sylvia
ran
quickly
towards
the
barn
you
do
mean
to
say
you
going
out
this
torrid
day
he
demanded
lifting
his
head
from
the
tin
bucket
in
which
he
had
submerged
it
as
she
voiced
her
request
and
eyeing
her
black
linen
habit
with
disfavor
it
no
hotter
on
the
highroad
than
in
the
hayfield
very
true
but
i
have
to
go
and
you
do
being
one
of
the
favored
few
of
this
earth
there
no
reason
why
you
should
sit
on
a
shady
porch
all
day
dressed
in
cool
muslin
and
sipping
iced
drinks
did
you
ever
see
me
in
a
green
muslin
i
saddle
dolly
myself
if
you
do
feel
like
it
she
spoke
very
quietly
but
the
immediate
consciousness
of
his
stupid
break
did
not
improve
austin
bad
temper
oh
i
saddle
for
you
but
the
heat
aside
i
think
you
ought
to
understand
that
it
is
best
for
a
woman
to
ride
about
on
these
lonely
roads
by
herself
it
was
different
a
few
years
ago
but
now
with
all
these
italian
and
portuguese
laborers
around
it
a
different
story
i
think
you
better
stay
at
home
the
unwarranted
and
dictatorial
tone
of
the
last
sentence
spoiled
the
speech
which
might
otherwise
in
spite
of
the
surly
manner
in
which
it
was
uttered
have
passed
for
an
expression
of
solicitude
sylvia
who
was
as
headstrong
as
she
was
amiable
gathered
up
her
reins
quickly
by
what
right
do
you
consider
yourself
in
a
position
to
dictate
to
me
she
demanded
by
none
at
all
but
it
only
decent
to
tell
you
the
risk
running
now
if
you
come
to
grief
i
certainly
sha
feel
sorry
from
your
usual
behavior
i
should
have
supposed
you
would
anyway
austin
mrs
cary
why
do
you
call
me
sylvia
as
all
the
rest
do
it
not
fitting
more
dictation
as
to
propriety
well
as
you
please
he
watched
her
ride
up
the
hill
almost
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
at
having
antagonized
and
hurt
her
then
turned
to
unharness
and
water
his
horses
he
knew
very
well
that
his
own
behavior
was
the
only
blot
on
a
summer
which
but
for
that
would
have
been
almost
perfect
for
every
other
member
of
the
family
and
yet
he
made
no
effort
to
alter
it
in
fact
only
a
few
days
before
his
sullen
resentment
of
the
manner
in
which
their
change
of
fortune
had
come
had
very
nearly
resulted
disastrously
for
them
all
and
the
more
he
brooded
over
it
the
more
sore
and
bitter
he
became
by
the
first
of
august
the
gray
homestead
had
regained
the
proud
distinction
which
it
had
enjoyed
in
the
days
of
its
builder
of
being
one
of
the
finest
in
the
county
the
house
with
its
wide
and
hospitable
piazza
shone
with
white
paint
the
disorderly
yard
had
become
a
smooth
lawn
a
riotous
with
color
stretched
out
towards
the
river
and
the
back
porch
was
concealed
with
growing
vines
only
the
barns
which
afforded
sylvia
no
reasonable
excuse
for
meddling
remained
as
before
unsightly
and
dilapidated
thomas
the
practical
farmer
had
lamented
this
as
he
and
austin
sat
smoking
their
pipes
one
sultry
evening
after
supper
perhaps
our
credit
has
improved
enough
now
so
that
we
could
borrow
some
money
at
the
wallacetown
bank
he
said
earnestly
and
if
you
and
father
were
so
averse
to
taking
that
good
offer
weston
made
you
last
week
for
the
south
meadow
we
have
almost
enough
to
rebuild
anyway
it
all
very
well
to
have
this
pride
in
the
whole
farm
just
as
grandfather
left
it
to
us
but
if
we
could
sell
part
and
take
care
of
the
rest
properly
it
would
be
a
darned
sight
better
business
why
do
you
ask
your
precious
cary
for
the
money
she
probably
give
it
to
you
outright
same
as
she
has
for
the
house
and
save
you
all
that
bother
look
here
thomas
swung
around
sharply
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
his
brother
arm
when
you
talk
about
her
you
wo
use
that
tone
if
i
know
it
austin
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
should
i
what
do
you
know
about
her
that
justifies
you
in
resenting
it
nothing
absolutely
nothing
she
been
here
four
months
and
none
of
us
have
any
idea
to
this
day
where
she
comes
from
or
where
all
this
money
comes
from
ask
her
if
you
dare
to
he
got
no
further
for
thomas
always
the
mildest
of
lads
struck
him
on
the
mouth
so
violently
that
he
tottered
backwards
and
in
doing
so
fell
straight
under
the
feet
of
sylvia
who
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
them
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
her
blue
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
face
as
white
as
when
she
had
first
come
to
them
thomas
how
you
she
cried
ca
you
understand
austin
at
all
and
make
allowances
and
oh
austin
how
could
both
of
you
please
forgive
me
for
overhearing
i
could
help
it
and
she
was
gone
thomas
was
on
his
feet
and
after
her
in
a
second
but
she
was
too
quick
for
him
her
door
was
locked
before
he
reached
it
and
repeated
knocking
and
calling
brought
no
answer
and
gray
who
slept
in
the
chamber
opening
from
the
and
back
of
sylvia
reported
the
next
morning
that
something
must
be
troubling
the
blessed
girl
for
they
had
heard
soft
sobbing
far
into
the
night
but
after
all
that
had
happened
before
and
was
to
be
expected
from
one
whose
heart
was
buried
in
the
grave
their
sons
made
no
comment
but
both
were
immeasurably
relieved
when
after
an
entire
day
spent
in
her
room
during
which
each
in
his
own
way
had
suffered
intensely
she
reappeared
at
supper
as
if
nothing
had
happened
it
was
a
glorious
night
and
she
suggested
as
she
left
the
table
that
thomas
might
take
her
for
a
short
paddle
a
canoe
being
among
the
many
things
which
had
been
gradually
arriving
for
her
all
summer
molly
and
edith
went
with
them
and
austin
smoked
alone
with
his
bitter
reflections
the
thunder
was
rumbling
in
good
earnest
when
howard
gray
and
thomas
came
clattering
up
with
their
last
load
of
hay
for
the
night
and
the
three
men
pitched
it
hastily
into
place
together
and
hurried
into
the
house
gray
was
bustling
about
slamming
windows
and
the
girls
were
bringing
in
the
hammocks
and
piazza
chairs
but
the
first
great
drops
began
to
fall
before
they
had
finished
and
the
wind
seldom
roused
in
the
quiet
valley
was
blowing
violently
edith
stopping
too
long
for
a
last
pillow
and
a
precious
book
was
drenched
to
the
skin
in
an
instant
the
house
was
pitch
dark
before
there
was
time
to
grope
for
lights
but
was
almost
immediately
illumined
by
a
brilliant
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
loud
report
my
but
this
storm
is
near
usually
i
do
mind
a
bit
but
i
declare
this
is
a
regular
edith
bring
me
but
gray
was
interrupted
by
the
elements
and
for
fifteen
minutes
no
one
made
any
further
effort
to
talk
the
rain
fell
in
sheets
the
wind
gathered
greater
and
greater
force
the
lightning
became
constant
and
blinding
while
each
clap
of
thunder
seemed
nearer
and
more
terrific
than
the
one
before
it
when
finally
a
deafening
roar
brought
them
all
suddenly
together
shouting
frantically
that
certainly
has
struck
here
it
was
true
before
they
could
even
reach
it
the
great
north
barn
was
in
flames
there
was
no
way
of
summoning
outside
help
even
if
any
one
could
have
reached
them
in
such
a
storm
and
the
wind
was
blowing
the
fire
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
house
in
less
than
an
hour
most
of
the
old
and
rotten
outbuildings
had
burnt
like
tinder
and
the
rest
had
collapsed
under
the
fury
of
the
sweeping
gale
but
by
eight
the
stricken
grays
almost
too
exhausted
and
overcome
to
speak
were
beginning
to
realize
that
though
all
their
hay
and
most
of
their
stock
were
destroyed
a
change
of
wind
combined
with
their
own
mighty
efforts
had
saved
the
beloved
old
house
its
were
shattered
and
its
blinds
were
torn
off
and
its
fresh
paint
smoked
and
defaced
with
sand
but
it
was
essentially
unharmed
the
hurricane
changed
to
a
steady
downpour
the
lightning
grew
dimmer
and
more
distant
and
vanished
altogether
and
gray
with
a
firm
expression
of
countenance
in
spite
of
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
set
about
to
finish
the
preparations
for
supper
which
the
storm
had
so
rudely
interrupted
three
hours
earlier
eat
an
keep
up
your
strength
an
that
help
to
keep
up
your
courage
she
said
patting
her
husband
on
the
shoulder
as
she
passed
him
here
katherine
take
them
biscuits
out
of
the
oven
an
molly
go
an
call
the
boys
in
there
ai
a
mite
of
use
in
their
stayin
out
there
any
longer
austin
was
the
last
to
appear
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
leaning
against
the
frame
a
huge
gaunt
figure
blackened
with
dirt
and
smoke
and
so
wet
that
the
water
dropped
in
little
pools
all
about
him
he
glanced
up
and
down
the
room
and
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
what
the
matter
austin
asked
his
mother
stopping
in
the
act
of
pouring
out
a
steaming
cup
of
tea
come
an
get
some
supper
you
feel
better
directly
it
ai
so
bad
but
what
it
might
be
a
sight
worse
and
get
some
he
cried
striding
towards
her
and
once
more
looking
wildly
around
the
thunderstorm
has
been
over
nearly
two
hours
plenty
of
time
for
her
to
get
home
she
never
minds
rain
or
to
telephone
if
she
had
taken
shelter
anywhere
and
can
any
one
tell
me
has
any
one
even
thought
i
did
till
five
minutes
ago
is
chapter
iv
sylvia
sylvia
sylvia
the
musical
name
echoed
and
reëchoed
through
the
silent
woods
but
there
was
no
other
answer
austin
lighted
a
match
shielded
it
from
the
rain
with
his
hand
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
just
past
midnight
oh
he
groaned
where
she
be
what
has
happened
to
her
if
i
only
knew
she
was
found
and
unharmed
and
safe
at
home
again
i
never
ask
for
anything
else
as
long
as
i
lived
he
had
knocked
his
lantern
against
a
tree
some
time
before
and
broken
it
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stumble
blindly
along
in
the
darkness
hoping
against
hope
howard
gray
had
gone
north
thomas
east
and
austin
south
before
starting
out
they
had
endeavored
to
telephone
but
the
storm
had
destroyed
the
wires
in
every
direction
after
travelling
almost
ten
miles
austin
went
home
thinking
that
by
that
time
either
his
father
or
his
brother
must
have
been
successful
in
his
search
to
be
met
only
by
the
anxious
despair
of
his
mother
and
sisters
do
you
worry
he
forced
himself
to
say
with
a
cheerfulness
he
was
very
far
from
feeling
she
may
have
gone
down
that
old
that
leads
out
of
the
elliotts
pasture
i
heard
her
telling
thomas
once
that
she
loved
to
explore
that
they
must
walk
down
there
some
sunday
afternoon
maybe
she
decided
to
go
alone
i
stop
at
the
house
and
see
if
fred
happened
to
see
her
pass
fred
had
not
but
elliott
had
there
was
little
that
escaped
her
eager
eyes
my
yes
i
see
her
go
tearin
past
before
the
storm
so
much
as
begun
she
sure
the
queerest
actin
i
ever
heard
of
sally
says
she
goes
swimmin
in
a
just
like
a
boy
an
floats
dives
like
a
fish
nice
actions
for
a
grievin
lady
if
you
ask
me
do
set
a
moment
austin
set
down
an
tell
me
about
the
fire
i
ai
had
no
details
at
all
an
i
feelin
real
bad
but
the
door
had
already
slammed
behind
austin
hurrying
figure
sylvia
sylvia
where
are
you
he
ploughed
along
for
what
seemed
like
endless
miles
calling
as
he
went
and
hearing
his
own
voice
come
back
to
him
over
and
over
again
like
a
mocking
spirit
the
wind
the
rain
and
the
darkness
conspired
together
to
make
what
was
rough
travelling
in
the
daytime
almost
impassable
strong
as
he
was
austin
sank
down
more
than
once
for
a
few
minutes
on
some
fallen
log
over
which
he
stumbled
at
these
times
the
vision
of
sylvia
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
of
the
buildings
which
had
been
in
spite
of
their
wretched
condition
dear
to
him
because
they
were
almost
all
he
had
in
the
world
seemed
to
rise
before
him
with
horrible
reality
sylvia
dressed
in
her
black
black
clothes
with
her
soft
dark
hair
and
her
eyes
and
her
vivid
red
lips
which
so
seldom
either
drooped
or
smiled
but
lay
tightly
closed
together
a
crimson
line
in
her
white
face
which
was
no
more
sorrowful
than
it
was
the
expression
was
as
pure
and
as
sad
and
as
gentle
as
that
of
a
mater
dolorosa
he
had
chanced
to
see
in
a
collection
of
prints
at
the
wallacetown
library
and
yet
and
yet
austin
knew
instinctively
that
the
dead
husband
whoever
he
might
have
been
and
his
own
brother
thomas
were
not
the
only
men
besides
himself
who
had
found
it
irresistibly
alluring
i
poorer
than
ever
now
he
groaned
to
himself
and
ignorant
and
mean
and
dirty
and
a
beast
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
ca
ever
atone
for
the
way
i
treated
her
for
the
way
i
but
if
i
could
only
find
her
and
oh
i
got
to
sylvia
sylvia
sylvia
the
rain
struck
about
by
the
wind
which
had
risen
again
lashed
against
the
leaves
of
the
trees
and
the
wet
swaying
boughs
struck
against
his
face
as
he
started
on
again
but
the
storm
and
his
own
footsteps
were
the
only
sounds
he
could
hear
it
was
growing
rapidly
colder
and
he
felt
more
than
once
in
his
pocket
to
make
sure
that
the
little
flask
of
brandy
he
had
brought
with
him
was
still
safe
and
tried
to
fasten
his
drenched
coat
more
tightly
about
him
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
shivered
but
this
he
realized
was
more
with
nervousness
than
with
chill
if
i
cold
what
must
she
be
in
that
linen
habit
and
she
so
little
and
frail
he
pulled
himself
together
i
must
stop
worrying
like
this
of
course
i
find
her
alive
and
unharmed
some
things
are
too
dreadful
they
just
ca
happen
i
got
to
have
a
chance
to
beg
her
forgiveness
for
all
i
said
and
done
and
thought
i
got
to
have
something
to
give
me
courage
to
start
all
over
again
and
make
a
man
of
myself
yet
to
cleanse
myself
of
ingratitude
and
bitterness
and
evil
passions
sylvia
sylvia
sylvia
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
called
it
a
thousand
times
suddenly
he
stopped
short
listening
his
heart
beating
like
a
hammer
then
standing
still
in
his
breast
it
could
be
but
oh
it
was
it
was
austin
is
that
you
yes
yes
yes
where
are
you
i
do
know
i
sure
what
a
question
and
instantly
a
feeling
of
relief
swept
through
him
she
was
able
to
see
the
absurdity
of
his
question
more
than
he
could
have
done
but
wherever
i
am
we
ca
be
far
apart
keep
on
calling
follow
my
voice
austin
austin
austin
all
right
coming
tell
me
are
you
hurt
no
that
is
not
much
how
much
dolly
was
frightened
by
the
storm
bolted
and
threw
me
off
i
must
have
been
stunned
for
a
few
minutes
i
afraid
i
sprained
my
ankle
in
falling
for
i
ca
walk
and
oh
austin
i
awfully
cold
and
wet
and
tired
i
know
it
it
been
just
hellish
for
you
keep
on
speaking
to
me
i
getting
nearer
i
put
out
my
hands
and
then
when
you
get
here
you
wo
stumble
over
me
i
sure
you
very
near
your
footsteps
sound
so
how
long
have
you
been
here
should
you
think
oh
hours
and
hours
i
was
riding
on
the
main
road
when
just
what
you
predicted
happened
it
served
me
right
i
ought
to
have
listened
to
you
and
so
oh
here
you
are
knew
all
the
you
come
he
grasped
the
little
cold
outstretched
hands
and
sank
down
beside
her
chafing
them
in
his
own
thank
god
i
found
you
he
said
huskily
and
gulped
hard
pressing
his
lips
together
then
forcing
himself
to
speak
quietly
he
went
on
sylvia
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
if
you
feel
able
but
first
you
must
drink
some
brandy
i
got
some
for
you
i
do
believe
i
can
i
was
all
right
until
a
moment
ago
but
now
everything
seems
to
be
going
around
austin
put
his
arm
around
her
and
forced
the
flask
to
her
lips
then
the
soft
head
sank
on
his
shoulder
and
he
realized
that
she
had
fainted
very
gently
he
laid
her
on
the
ground
and
fumbled
in
the
dark
for
the
fastenings
of
her
habit
when
it
was
loosened
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
flannel
shirt
putting
the
coat
over
her
and
the
shirt
under
her
head
for
a
pillow
then
listening
anxiously
for
her
breathing
felt
again
for
her
mouth
and
poured
more
brandy
between
her
lips
there
were
a
few
moments
of
anxious
waiting
then
she
sighed
moved
restlessly
and
tried
to
sit
up
lie
still
sylvia
you
fainted
you
got
to
keep
very
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
how
stupid
of
me
but
i
all
right
now
i
said
lie
still
all
right
all
right
i
will
but
you
frighten
me
out
of
my
wits
if
you
use
that
tone
of
voice
i
did
mean
to
frighten
you
but
you
got
to
keep
quiet
for
your
own
sake
sylvia
i
thought
you
said
you
would
call
me
sylvia
i
said
a
good
many
foolish
things
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
changed
my
mind
about
them
afterwards
or
feel
sorry
if
i
came
to
grief
and
a
good
many
untrue
and
wicked
ones
for
which
i
have
repented
afterwards
well
i
did
come
to
grief
or
pretty
nearly
i
met
three
polish
workmen
on
the
road
i
think
they
were
intoxicated
anyway
they
tried
to
stop
me
i
was
lucky
in
managing
to
turn
in
here
so
quickly
they
realize
what
i
was
going
to
do
if
i
had
been
near
the
entrance
to
this
austin
what
makes
you
grip
my
hand
so
you
hurt
promise
me
you
never
ride
alone
again
he
said
his
voice
shaking
i
certainly
never
shall
and
could
you
possibly
promise
me
too
that
you
forgive
the
absolutely
unforgivable
way
i
acted
all
summer
and
give
me
a
chance
to
show
that
i
can
do
better
oh
yes
please
do
feel
badly
about
that
i
i
never
misunderstood
at
all
i
know
you
had
an
awfully
hard
row
to
hoe
and
that
made
you
bitter
and
any
man
hates
to
have
a
woman
help
financially
besides
she
hesitated
and
went
on
with
a
humility
very
different
from
her
usual
sweet
imperiousness
i
been
pretty
unhappy
myself
and
it
made
and
obstinate
and
dictatorial
you
you
more
like
an
angel
than
i
ever
dreamed
any
woman
could
be
oh
i
not
i
not
please
do
think
so
for
a
minute
because
if
you
do
we
start
out
on
a
false
basis
and
not
be
real
friends
the
way
i
hope
we
going
to
be
now
yes
and
please
may
i
sit
up
now
and
really
my
hands
are
warm
he
dropped
them
instantly
and
i
would
like
to
hear
about
the
storm
whether
it
has
done
much
damage
if
you
know
it
has
destroyed
every
building
we
owned
except
the
house
itself
austin
you
not
in
earnest
i
never
was
more
so
oh
i
sorry
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
one
of
the
little
hands
that
had
been
withdrawn
a
moment
earlier
groped
for
his
in
the
darkness
and
pressed
it
gently
she
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
but
finally
she
went
on
it
seems
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
but
perhaps
it
may
prove
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
believe
thomas
is
right
in
thinking
that
a
smaller
farm
which
you
could
manage
easily
and
well
without
hiring
help
would
be
more
profitable
and
now
it
will
seem
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
sell
that
great
southern
meadow
to
mr
weston
yes
i
suppose
so
he
offered
us
three
thousand
dollars
for
it
he
does
care
to
buy
the
little
brick
cottage
that
goes
with
it
which
is
strange
for
it
has
only
five
rooms
and
is
horribly
out
of
repair
grandfather
used
it
for
his
foreman
but
of
course
we
never
needed
it
and
never
shall
so
i
wish
he
did
want
it
oh
austin
could
buy
it
i
been
for
it
ever
since
i
first
saw
it
it
could
be
made
perfectly
charming
and
it
plenty
big
enough
for
me
i
sold
my
fifth
avenue
house
and
i
going
to
sell
the
one
on
long
island
too
great
hideous
barnlike
places
your
mother
wo
want
me
forever
and
i
want
a
little
place
of
my
very
own
and
hamstead
and
the
river
and
the
valley
i
did
dare
suggest
this
you
all
except
thomas
seemed
so
averse
to
disposing
of
any
of
the
property
but
if
we
sell
the
meadow
to
weston
i
am
sure
you
can
have
the
cottage
and
as
much
land
as
you
want
around
it
but
the
trouble
is
you
need
a
great
deal
more
money
of
course
i
know
that
have
you
any
insurance
very
little
for
some
moments
she
sat
turning
things
over
in
her
mind
and
was
quiet
for
so
long
that
austin
began
to
fear
that
she
was
more
badly
hurt
than
she
had
admitted
and
found
it
an
effort
to
talk
is
anything
the
matter
he
asked
at
last
anxiously
are
you
in
pain
no
only
thinking
austin
if
you
can
not
secure
a
loan
at
some
local
bank
would
you
be
very
averse
to
borrowing
the
money
from
me
whatever
the
sum
is
that
you
need
i
am
investing
all
the
time
and
i
will
ask
the
regular
rates
of
interest
are
you
offended
with
me
for
making
such
a
suggestion
i
am
not
i
was
too
much
moved
to
answer
for
a
minute
that
is
all
it
is
beyond
my
comprehension
how
you
could
bring
yourself
to
do
it
after
overhearing
what
you
heard
me
say
the
other
evening
then
you
accept
if
father
and
thomas
think
best
i
will
and
thank
you
too
for
not
calling
it
a
gift
are
you
likely
to
be
offended
if
i
go
on
and
suggest
something
further
no
but
i
am
likely
to
be
so
overwhelmed
that
i
shall
not
be
of
much
practical
use
to
you
well
then
i
like
you
to
take
a
thousand
dollars
more
than
you
need
for
building
and
spend
it
in
travelling
in
travelling
yes
thomas
is
a
born
farmer
and
the
four
years
that
he
is
going
to
have
at
the
state
agricultural
college
are
going
to
be
exactly
what
he
wants
and
needs
he
is
sensitive
enough
so
that
he
mind
being
a
little
older
than
most
of
the
fellows
in
his
class
but
of
course
for
you
anything
like
that
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
how
old
are
you
anyway
well
if
you
could
get
away
from
here
for
a
time
and
see
other
people
how
they
do
things
how
they
make
a
little
money
go
a
long
way
and
a
little
land
go
still
farther
how
they
work
hard
and
fail
many
times
and
succeed
in
the
end
not
the
science
of
farming
that
thomas
is
going
to
learn
but
the
accomplished
fact
i
believe
it
would
be
the
making
of
you
my
uncle
mat
was
one
of
the
first
importers
of
holstein
cattle
in
this
country
and
i
like
to
have
you
do
just
what
he
did
when
he
got
through
college
of
course
you
can
buy
all
the

united
states

every
kind
sort
and
description

as
good
as
there
are
anywhere
in
the
world
but
i
want
you
to
go
to
europe
nevertheless
start
right
off
while
thomas
is
still
at
home
to
help
your
father
take
a
steamer
that
goes
direct
to
holland
get
into
the
interior
with
an
interpreter
then
cross
over
to
the
channel
islands
by
that
time
you
be
in
a
position
to
decide
whether
you
want
to
stock
your
farm
with
holsteins
which
have
the
strongest
constitutions
and
give
the
most
milk
or
jerseys
which
give
the
richest
while
over
there
go
to
paris
and
london
for
a
few
days
and
see
something
besides
cows
come
home
by
liverpool
i
know
the
united
states
minister
to
the
netherlands
very
well
and
no
end
of
people
in
paris
i
give
you
some
letters
of
introduction
and
you
have
a
good
time
besides
getting
a
practical
education
the
whole
trip
need
take
you
more
than
eight
weeks
then
next
spring
visit
a
few
of
the
big
farms
in
new
york
and
the
middle
west
and
go
to
one
of
those
big
cattle
auctions
they
hold
in
syracuse
in
july
then
for
heaven
sake
sylvia
where
did
you
pick
up
all
this
information
about
farming
from
uncle
mat
but
i
tell
you
all
about
that
some
other
time
the
question
is
now
you
go
god
bless
you
that
settled
then
she
cried
happily
i
was
fairly
trembling
with
fear
that
you
refuse
why
it
so
hard
for
you
to
accept
things
i
do
know
i
been
bitter
all
my
life
because
i
had
to
go
without
so
much
and
this
summer
i
been
equally
bitter
because
things
were
changing
it
must
be
just
natural
cussedness
but
i
honestly
going
to
try
to
do
better
we
got
to
stay
here
until
morning
have
we
i
afraid
we
have
you
ca
walk
and
even
if
you
could
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
against
our
finding
the
highroad
in
this
egyptian
darkness
when
the
sun
comes
up
i
can
pick
my
own
way
along
through
the
underbrush
all
right
and
carry
you
at
the
same
time
you
must
weigh
about
ninety
pounds
i
weigh
one
hundred
and
ten
the
idea
there
really
no
chance
then
of
our
moving
for
several
hours
i
sorry
but
you
must
see
there
is
not
does
it
seem
as
if
you
could
bear
being
so
dreadfully
uncomfortable
that
much
longer
not
in
the
least
i
all
right
but
do
you
mind
being
here
alone
with
me
no
why
on
earth
should
i
let
me
finish
my
sentence
i
was
only
wondering
if
it
might
not
help
to
pass
the
time
if
i
told
you
a
story
it
not
a
very
pleasant
one
but
i
think
it
might
help
you
over
some
hard
places
yourself
if
you
heard
it
and
if
you
would
tell
part
of
it
as
much
as
you
think
best
to
your
family
after
we
get
home
i
should
be
very
grateful
some
of
it
should
in
all
justice
have
been
told
to
you
all
long
ago
since
you
were
so
good
as
to
receive
me
when
you
knew
nothing
whatever
about
me
and
the
rest
is
just
for
you
is
the
telling
going
to
be
hard
for
you
i
do
think
so
this
way
in
the
dark
and
alone
it
has
all
seemed
too
unspeakably
dreadful
to
talk
about
until
just
lately
but
i
been
growing
so
much
happier
i
think
it
may
be
a
relief
to
tell
some
one
now
then
do
by
all
means
i
feel
yes
more
honored
than
i
can
tell
you
by
your
confidence
austin
when
it
you
to
say
such
nice
things
as
you
have
several
times
do
you
waste
time
saying
disagreeable
ones
the
way
you
usually
do
to
everybody
i
just
told
you
i
do
know
but
i
going
to
do
better
well
there
was
once
a
girl
whose
father
had
died
when
she
was
a
baby
and
who
lived
with
her
mother
and
a
maid
in
a
tiny
flat
in
new
york
city
it
was
a
pretty
little
flat
and
they
had
plenty
to
eat
and
to
wear
and
a
good
many
pleasant
friends
and
acquaintances
but
they
did
have
much
money
that
is
compared
to
the
other
people
they
knew
this
girl
went
to
a
school
where
all
her
mates
had
ten
times
as
much
spending
money
as
she
did
who
possessed
hundreds
of
things
which
she
coveted
and
who
were
constantly
showering
favors
upon
her
which
she
had
no
way
of
returning
so
from
the
earliest
time
that
she
could
remember
she
felt
discontented
and
dissatisfied
and
regarded
herself
as
having
been
picked
out
by
providence
for
unusual
misfortunes
and
her
mother
agreed
with
her
i
fancy
it
is
never
very
pleasant
to
be
poor
but
if
one
can
be
frankly
poor
in
calico
and
overalls
the
way
you
been
i
do
believe
quite
so
hard
as
it
is
to
be
poor
and
try
keep
up
appearances
as
the
saying
is
this
girl
learned
very
early
the
meaning
of
that
convenient
phrase
she
gave
parties
and
went
without
proper
food
for
a
week
afterwards
she
had
pretty
dresses
to
wear
to
dances
and
wore
shabby
finery
about
the
house
she
bought
theatre
tickets
and
candy
but
never
had
a
cent
to
give
to
charity
she
usually
stayed
in
the
sweltering
city
all
summer
because
there
was
not
enough
money
to
go
away
for
the
summer
and
still
have
some
left
for
the
next
winter
season
and
she
spent
two
years
at
miserable
little
in
europe
that
pet
economy
of
fashionable
americans
who
would
not
for
one
moment
in
their
own
country
put
up
with
the
bad
food
and
the
unsanitary
quarters
and
the
vulgar
associates
which
they
endure
there
before
she
was
sixteen
years
old
this
girl
began
to
be
to
men
as
another
stock
phrase
goes
i
may
be
mistaken
and
i
never
have
a
chance
now
to
find
out
whether
i
am
or
not
but
i
believe
if
i
had
a
daughter
like
that
it
would
be
my
earnest
wish
to
bring
her
up
in
some
quiet
country
place
where
she
could
dress
simply
and
spend
much
time
outdoors
and
not
see
too
many
people
until
she
was
nineteen
or
twenty
but
the
mother
i
have
been
talking
about
did
feel
that
way
she
taught
her
daughter
to
make
the
most
of
her
looks
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
and
her
figure
she
showed
her
how
to
arrange
her
dress
in
a
way
which
should
seem
simple
and
really
be
alluring
she
drilled
her
in
the
art
of
being
flippant
without
being
pert
of
appearing
gentle
when
she
was
only
sly
of
saying
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
what
is
much
more
important
keeping
still
at
the
right
time
the
pupil
was
docile
because
she
was
eager
to
learn
and
she
was
clever
she
made
very
few
mistakes
and
she
never
made
the
same
one
twice
of
course
all
this
education
had
one
aim
and
end
a
rich
husband
hope
i
brought
you
up
too
sensibly
the
mother
used
to
say
you
to
even
think
of
throwing
yourself
away
on
the
first
attractive
boy
that
proposes
to
you
your
type
is
just
the
kind
to
appeal
to
some
big
heavy
oversated
millionaire
keep
your
eyes
open
for
him
the
daughter
was
as
obedient
in
listening
to
this
counsel
as
she
had
been
in
regard
to
the
others
for
it
fell
in
exactly
with
her
own
wishes
she
was
tired
of
being
poor
of
scrimping
and
saving
and
up
appearances
the
innumerable
young
bank
clerks
and
journalists
and
teachers
and
college
students
who
fluttered
about
her
burnt
their
to
no
avail
but
that
a
really
rich
man
found
her
very
kind
to
him
well
you
can
guess
the
result
when
she
was
not
quite
eighteen
a
man
who
was
beyond
question
a
millionaire
proposed
to
her
and
she
accepted
him
he
was
nearly
twenty
years
older
than
she
was
and
was
certainly
big
heavy
and
oversated
her
uncle
her
father
brother
came
to
her
mother
and
told
her
certain
plain
facts
about
this
man
and
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
and
charged
her
to
tell
the
child
what
she
would
be
doing
if
she
married
him
perhaps
if
the
uncle
had
gone
to
the
girl
herself
it
might
have
done
some
good
perhaps
it
would
have
you
see
she
was
so
tired
of
being
poor
that
she
thought
nothing
else
mattered
anyway
he
felt
a
woman
could
break
these
ugly
facts
to
a
young
girl
better
than
a
man
and
he
was
right
only
you
see
the
mother
never
told
at
all
not
that
she
really
feared
that
her
daughter
would
be
foolish
and
play
false
to
her
excellent
training
but
still
it
was
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
the
millionaire
was
quite
mad
about
his
little
fiancée
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
pay
in
advance
all
the
expenses
for
a
big
fashionable
wedding
with
twelve
bridesmaids
and
a
at
sherry
he
was
eager
to
load
her
with
jewels
and
settle
a
large
sum
of
money
upon
her
and
take
her
around
the
world
for
her
honeymoon
journey
he
loved
her
little
soft
tricks
of
speech
the
shy
way
in
which
she
dropped
her
eyes
the
curve
of
the
simple
white
dress
that
fell
away
from
her
neck
when
she
leaned
towards
him
and
though
she
saw
him
drink
and
drank
with
him
more
than
once
before
her
marriage
he
took
excellent
care
that
it
was
not
until
several
nights
afterwards
that
she
found
him
really
drunk
and
they
must
have
been
married
two
months
before
she
began
to
really
comprehend
what
she
had
done
there
is
much
more
to
tell
that
can
be
told
the
woman
who
sells
herself
with
or
without
a
wedding
ring
has
probably
always
existed
and
probably
always
will
but
i
doubt
whether
any
one
of
them
ever
has
told
or
ever
will
the
full
price
which
she
pays
in
her
turn
she
deserves
all
the
censure
she
gets
and
more
but
oh
she
does
deserve
a
little
pity
with
it
when
this
girl
had
been
married
nearly
a
year
she
heard
her
husband
coming
upstairs
one
night
long
after
midnight
in
a
condition
she
had
learned
to
recognize
and
fear
she
locked
her
bedroom
door
when
he
discovered
that
he
was
furiously
angry
as
i
said
before
he
was
a
big
man
and
he
was
very
strong
he
knocked
out
a
panel
put
his
hand
through
and
turned
the
key
when
he
reached
her
he
reminded
her
that
she
had
been
perfectly
willing
to
marry
him
that
she
was
his
wife
his
property
anything
you
choose
to
call
it
he
struck
her
the
next
day
she
was
very
ill
and
the
child
which
should
have
been
born
three
months
later
came
and
went
before
evening
the
next
year
she
was
not
so
fortunate
her
second
baby
was
born
at
the
right
time
her
husband
was
away
with
another
woman
when
it
happened
a
horrible
diseased
little
creature
with
staring
sightless
eyes
thank
god
it
lived
only
two
weeks
and
its
mother
after
a
long
period
of
suffering
and
agony
during
which
she
felt
like
a
leper
recovered
again
in
time
to
see
her
husband
die
after
three
nights
during
which
she
got
no
sleep
of
delirium
tremens
leaving
her
with
over
two
million
dollars
to
spend
as
she
chose
and
the
degradation
of
her
body
and
the
ruin
of
her
soul
to
think
of
all
the
rest
of
her
life
sylvia
the
cry
with
which
austin
broke
his
long
silence
came
from
the
innermost
depths
of
his
being
sylvia
sylvia
you
sha
say
such
things
they
not
true
do
throw
yourself
on
the
ground
and
cry
that
way
he
bent
over
her
vainly
trying
to
keep
his
own
voice
from
trembling
if
i
could
have
guessed
what
telling
this
this
hideous
story
would
mean
to
you
i
never
should
have
let
you
do
it
and
it
all
my
fault
that
you
felt
you
ought
to
do
it
partly
because
of
those
vile
speeches
i
made
the
other
evening
partly
because
i
let
you
see
how
wickedly
discontented
i
been
myself
partly
because
you
must
have
heard
me
urging
my
own
sister
to
make
practically
this
same
kind
of
a
marriage
oh
if
it
any
comfort
to
you
to
know
it
you
have
told
me
in
vain
sylvia
do
speak
to
me
and
tell
me
that
you
believe
me
and
that
you
forgive
me
she
managed
to
give
him
the
assurance
he
sought
her
desperate
passionate
voice
grown
gentle
and
quiet
again
but
she
was
too
tired
and
spent
to
be
comforted
for
a
long
time
she
lay
so
still
that
he
became
alarmed
thinking
she
must
have
fainted
again
and
drew
closer
to
her
to
listen
to
her
breathing
at
first
there
was
a
little
catch
in
it
betraying
sobs
not
yet
wholly
controlled
then
gradually
it
grew
calm
and
even
she
had
fallen
asleep
from
sheer
exhaustion
austin
sitting
motionless
beside
her
found
the
night
one
of
purification
and
dedication
to
men
of
thomas
type
slow
of
wit
steady
and
stolid
and
unemotional
the
soil
gives
much
of
her
own
peaceful
wholesomeness
but
those
like
austin
with
finer
intellects
higher
ambitions
and
stronger
passions
often
fare
ill
at
her
hands
their
struggles
towards
education
and
the
refinements
of
life
are
balked
by
poverty
and
the
utter
fatigue
which
comes
from
overwork
while
their
search
for
pleasure
often
ends
in
a
knowledge
and
experience
of
vices
so
crude
and
tawdry
that
men
of
greater
wealth
and
more
happy
experience
would
turn
from
them
in
disgust
not
because
they
were
more
moral
but
because
they
could
afford
to
be
more
fastidious
between
broadway
and
the
main
street
of
wallacetown
and
other
places
of
its
type
small
railroad
or
manufacturing
centres
standing
alone
in
an
otherwise
purely
agricultural
community
the
odds
in
favor
of
virtue
not
to
say
decency
are
all
in
favor
of
broadway
and
wallacetown
to
the
average
youth
of
hamstead
represents
the
one
opportunity
for
a
show
something
to
drink
and
life
in
general
sylvia
had
unlocked
the
door
of
material
opportunity
for
austin
but
she
had
done
far
more
than
this
she
had
given
him
the
vision
of
the
higher
things
that
lay
beyond
that
and
the
desire
to
attain
them
further
than
that
neither
she
nor
any
other
woman
could
help
him
the
future
to
make
or
mar
lay
now
within
his
own
hands
and
in
the
same
spirit
of
consecration
with
which
the
knights
of
old
prayed
that
they
might
attain
true
chivalry
during
the
long
vigil
before
their
accolade
austin
kept
his
watch
that
night
and
made
his
vow
that
the
future
in
spite
of
the
discouragements
and
mistakes
and
failures
which
it
must
inevitably
contain
should
be
undaunted
by
obstacles
and
clean
of
lust
and
high
of
purpose
the
wind
and
rain
ceased
the
clouds
grew
less
heavy
and
at
last
just
before
dawn
a
few
stars
shone
faintly
in
the
clearing
sky
then
the
sun
rose
in
a
blaze
of
glory
sylvia
had
not
moved
and
lay
with
one
arm
under
her
dark
head
the
undried
tears
still
on
her
cheeks
austin
lifted
her
gently
and
started
towards
the
highroad
with
her
in
his
arms
she
stirred
slightly
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
then
lifted
her
hands
and
clasped
them
around
his
neck
it
be
easier
to
carry
me
that
way
she
murmured
drowsily
austin
you
awfully
good
to
me
her
eyes
closed
again
a
sheet
of
white
fire
like
that
of
which
he
had
been
conscious
on
the
afternoon
when
they
straightened
out
the
yard
together
only
a
thousand
times
more
powerful
seemed
to
envelop
him
again
he
looked
down
at
the
lovely
sleeping
face
at
the
dark
lashes
curling
over
the
white
cheeks
and
the
red
sweet
lips
if
he
kissed
her
what
harm
would
be
done
she
would
never
even
know
then
he
flung
back
his
head
sylvia
was
as
far
above
him
as
those
pale
stars
of
the
early
dawn
it
was
clear
to
him
that
no
one
must
ever
guess
how
dearly
he
loved
her
but
he
knew
that
it
was
far
far
more
essential
that
he
in
his
unworthiness
should
not
profane
his
own
ideal
she
was
not
for
his
touch
scarcely
for
his
thoughts
the
kiss
which
did
not
reach
her
lips
burned
into
his
soul
instead
and
cleansed
it
with
its
healing
flame
chapter
v
sylvia
sprain
as
austin
had
suspected
proved
much
more
serious
than
she
had
admitted
but
when
the
village
doctor
came
about
noon
to
dress
her
ankle
she
insisted
that
she
was
none
the
worse
for
her
long
exposure
and
that
if
she
must
lie
still
on
a
lounge
for
two
weeks
the
least
the
family
could
do
would
be
to
humor
her
in
everything
and
spend
as
much
time
as
possible
with
her
or
she
would
certainly
die
of
boredom
she
passed
the
entire
day
in
making
and
unfolding
plans
looking
up
the
sailing
dates
of
steamships
and
writing
letters
of
introduction
for
austin
by
night
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
weston
offer
for
the
south
meadow
had
been
accepted
that
the
wallacetown
bank
and
the
insurance
money
would
furnish
part
of
the
needed
funds
and
that
she
was
to
be
allowed
to
loan
the
rest
and
that
the
little
brick
cottage
belonged
to
her
the
fact
that
austin
had
had
a
long
talk
with
his
father
and
brother
and
that
his
passage
for
holland
had
been
engaged
by
telegraph
seemed
scarcely
less
of
an
achievement
to
her
but
gray
noticed
as
she
kissed
her
little
benefactress
after
seeing
her
comfortably
settled
for
the
night
that
her
usually
pale
cheeks
were
very
red
and
her
eyes
unnaturally
bright
and
worried
over
her
all
night
long
the
next
morning
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
sylvia
was
really
ill
and
two
days
later
wells
shook
his
head
with
dissatisfaction
after
using
his
thermometer
and
stethoscope
he
was
a
conscientious
man
who
lacked
and
the
look
of
things
was
disquieting
to
him
i
think
you
ought
to
get
a
nurse
he
said
in
the
hall
to
gray
as
he
went
out
and
probably
she
would
like
to
have
her
own
doctor
from
the
city
in
consultation
and
some
member
of
her
family
come
to
her
it
looks
to
me
very
much
as
if
we
were
in
for
bronchial
pneumonia
and
she
a
delicate
little
thing
at
best
sylvia
was
laughing
when
gray
bent
on
being
both
firm
and
tactful
reentered
her
room
tell
wells
he
must
make
his
softer
if
he
does
want
me
to
overhear
him
she
said
and
do
think
of
ordering
the
funeral
flowers
just
yet
i
not
delicate
i
strong
as
an
ox
if
i
were
i
should
be
alive
at
all
get
a
nurse
by
all
means
if
it
will
make
things
easier
for
you
that
the
only
reason
i
need
one
they
usually
more
bother
than
they
worth
but
i
know
of
two
or
three
who
might
do
fairly
well
if
any
one
of
them
is
free
my
doctor
is
an
old
fogey
and
i
wo
have
him
around
as
for
family
i
not
as
greatly
blessed
numerically
or
otherwise
in
that
respect
as
the
grays
but
my
uncle
mat
would
love
to
come
i
feel
sure
as
he
rather
hurt
at
my
runaway
conduct
she
gave
the
necessary
addresses
and
still
persisting
that
they
were
making
a
great
fuss
about
nothing
turned
over
on
her
pillow
in
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
sylvia
was
right
in
one
thing
she
was
much
stronger
than
wells
guessed
and
though
the
next
week
proved
an
anxious
one
for
every
member
of
the
household
except
herself
it
was
not
a
dismal
one
even
if
she
were
flat
on
her
back
her
spirit
and
her
vitality
remained
contagious
thomas
whose
state
of
mind
was
by
this
time
quite
apparent
to
the
family
though
he
imagined
it
to
be
a
secret
hung
about
outside
her
door
positive
that
she
was
going
to
die
and
brought
offerings
in
the
shape
of
flowers
early
apples
and
pet
animals
which
he
thought
might
distract
her
austin
who
shared
his
room
insisted
that
he
could
not
sleep
because
thomas
groaned
and
sighed
so
all
night
molly
pertly
asked
him
why
he
did
not
try
rabbits
as
kittens
did
not
seem
to
appeal
to
sylvia
and
his
mother
bantered
him
for
thinking
of
any
one
so
far
above
him
whose
heart
moreover
was
buried
in
the
grave
austin
somewhat
expurgated
version
of
sylvia
story
put
an
end
to
the
latter
part
of
the
protest
but
sent
his
hearers
into
a
new
ferment
of
excitement
and
sympathy
sally
who
was
all
ready
to
start
for
a
ball
in
wallacetown
with
fred
when
she
heard
it
declared
she
could
go
one
step
it
made
her
feel
that
low
in
her
spirits
and
fred
replied
by
gosh
he
did
blame
her
one
mite
whereat
they
wandered
off
and
spent
the
evening
at
a
very
comfortable
distance
from
the
house
but
fairly
close
together
revelling
in
a
wealth
of
gruesome
facts
and
suppositions
katherine
said
she
certainly
never
would
marry
at
all
men
were
such
dreadful
creatures
and
molly
said
yes
indeed
but
what
else
a
girl
marry
while
edith
determined
to
devote
the
rest
of
life
to
attending
and
adoring
the
lovely
sad
drooping
widow
whose
existence
was
to
be
one
long
poem
of
beautiful
seclusion
and
she
was
so
pleased
with
her
own
ideas
and
her
manner
of
expressing
them
that
she
wept
scalding
tears
into
the
broth
she
was
making
for
sylvia
as
she
stirred
it
over
the
stove
the
presence
of
uncle
mat
greatly
dreaded
beforehand
proved
an
unexpected
source
of
solace
and
delight
he
was
a
quiet
shrewd
little
man
not
unlike
sylvia
in
many
ways
but
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
brisk
manner
of
speech
which
she
did
not
possess
he
sized
up
the
gray
family
quickly
and
apparently
with
satisfaction
for
he
talked
quite
freely
of
his
niece
to
them
and
they
saw
that
they
were
not
alone
in
their
estimate
of
her
it
certainly
was
a
great
stroke
of
luck
all
round
for
her
as
well
as
for
you
when
she
blew
in
here
he
said
but
if
you
knew
what
an
awful
hole
we
think
she
left
behind
her
in
new
york
you
think
yourselves
doubly
lucky
to
have
her
all
to
yourselves
there
more
than
one
young
man
i
can
tell
you
with
a
sly
look
at
thomas
watching
out
for
her
return
you
should
have
seen
her
at
a
party
i
gave
for
her
three
years
ago
or
more
dressed
in
a
pink
frock
looped
up
with
roses
and
with
cheeks
to
match
she
was
always
this
pale
little
shadow
i
can
tell
you
well
the
boys
were
around
her
that
night
like
bees
round
a
honeysuckle
bush
no
denying
there
something
almighty
irresistible
about
these
little
girls
now
is
there
ah
her
roses
did
last
long
poor
child
now
you
given
her
a
good
healthful
place
to
live
in
and
something
to
think
about
and
do
she
have
lost
her
reason
without
them
after
all
she
been
through
but
when
you
tired
of
her
i
want
her
i
a
poor
forlorn
lonely
old
bachelor
and
i
need
her
a
great
deal
more
than
any
of
you
what
do
you
say
to
a
little
walk
gray
before
we
turn
in
i
want
to
have
a
look
at
your
fine
farm
i
have
a
farm
myself
no
such
grand
old
place
as
this
of
course
but
a
neat
little
toy
not
far
from
the
city
where
i
can
run
down
sundays
sylvia
used
to
be
very
fond
of
going
down
with
me
it
from
my
foreman
a
queer
scientific
chap
jenkins
his
name
is
that
she
picked
up
all
these
notions
she
been
unloading
on
you
pretty
good
most
of
them
are
they
though
you
must
run
down
there
some
time
boys
and
look
things
over
it
well
to
go
about
a
bit
when
one
thinking
of
building
and
branching
out
sylvia
idea
exactly
is
it
gray
and
thomas
did
run
down
seizing
the
opportunity
while
austin
was
still
at
home
and
while
there
was
practically
no
to
be
done
jenkins
did
the
honors
of
stevens
little
place
handsomely
and
they
returned
with
magnificent
plans
from
the
erection
of
silos
and
the
laying
of
concrete
floors
to
the
proper
feeding
of
poultry
when
uncle
mat
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
business
after
staying
over
two
weeks
with
the
grays
austin
went
with
him
for
he
suggested
that
he
would
be
glad
to
have
the
boy
as
his
guest
in
new
york
for
a
few
days
before
he
sailed
you
better
have
a
glimpse
of
the
little
toy
too
he
said
and
perhaps
see
something
of
a
rather
neat
little
city
too
want
to
do
a
little
shopping
and
so
on
and
i
might
be
of
assistance
in
that
way
i
do
see
how
you
can
go
said
thomas
to
austin
the
night
before
he
left
as
they
were
undressing
while
sylvia
is
still
in
bed
and
be
around
for
another
week
at
least
she
responsible
for
all
your
tremendous
good
fortune
and
you
leave
without
even
saying
thank
you
and
you
a
darned
queer
ungrateful
cuss
and
always
were
i
know
it
said
austin
and
such
being
the
of
the
beast
do
bother
trying
to
make
me
over
you
can
be
grateful
and
devoted
enough
for
both
of
us
now
do
shut
up
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
i
sure
will
be
thankful
to
get
a
room
to
myself
if
i
not
for
anything
else
i
do
see
how
any
one
can
help
being
crazy
over
her
continued
thomas
thumping
his
pillow
as
if
he
would
like
to
pummel
any
one
who
disagreed
with
him
do
you
asked
austin
the
next
night
he
was
in
new
york
with
stevens
trying
hard
to
feel
natural
in
a
tiny
flat
which
was
only
one
of
fifty
in
the
same
great
house
a
colored
butler
served
an
elaborate
dinner
at
eight
in
the
evening
and
brought
black
coffee
liqueurs
and
cigars
into
the
afterwards
and
worst
of
all
unpacked
all
his
scanty
belongings
and
laid
them
about
his
room
austin
really
suffered
and
the
cold
perspiration
ran
down
his
back
but
he
watched
his
host
carefully
and
waited
from
one
moment
to
another
to
see
what
would
be
expected
of
him
next
he
managed
too
before
he
went
to
bed
to
ask
a
question
which
had
been
on
his
mind
for
some
time
would
you
mind
telling
me
sir
where
sylvia
mother
is
uncle
mat
shot
one
of
his
keen
little
glances
in
austin
direction
why
no
not
at
all
as
nearly
as
i
can
he
said
my
brother
austin
made
a
most
unfortunate
match
his
wife
was
a
mean
mercenary
greedy
woman
as
hard
as
nails
and
as
tough
as
leather
but
handsome
oh
very
handsome
as
a
girl
and
clever
i
assure
you
i
have
often
been
almost
glad
that
my
brother
did
not
live
long
enough
to
see
her
in
her
real
colors
she
married
very
soon
after
sylvia
herself
a
worthless
englishman
discharged
from
the
army
i
believe
who
had
probably
been
her
lover
for
some
time
cary
gave
her
a
check
for
a
hundred
thousand
to
get
rid
of
her
the
day
after
his
wedding
to
sylvia
and
the
pair
are
probably
living
in
great
comfort
on
that
at
some
french
resort
thank
you
for
telling
me
but
it
rather
awful
is
it
that
any
one
should
have
to
think
of
her
mother
as
sylvia
must
why
my
mother
he
stopped
flushing
as
he
thought
of
how
commonplace
how
homely
and
ordinary
his
mother
had
often
seemed
to
him
how
he
had
brooded
over
his
father
unfortunate
match
my
mother
has
worked
her
fingers
to
the
bone
for
all
of
us
and
i
believe
she
let
herself
be
chopped
in
pieces
to
help
us
gladly
any
day
yes
assented
stevens
i
know
she
would
there
are
several
different
kinds
of
mothers
in
the
world
it
a
thousand
pities
sylvia
did
not
have
a
fair
show
at
a
job
of
that
sort
she
would
have
been
one
of
the
successful
kind
i
fancy
it
would
seem
so
said
austin
chapter
vi
new
york
city
august
dear
mother
and
father
i
going
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
picture
to
send
you
for
if
things
move
at
the
same
rate
in
europe
that
they
do
in
new
york
i
certainly
sha
have
time
to
write
many
letters
but
i
send
a
good
long
one
anyhow
i
always
thought
i
like
to
live
in
the
city
as
you
know
but
a
few
days
of
this
has
already
given
me
a
sort
of
breathless
feeling
that
i
ought
always
to
be
on
the
move
whether
anything
special
to
do
or
not
the
noise
never
stops
for
one
minute
night
or
day
and
the
streets
are
perfect
miracles
of
light
and
dirt
and
this
whole
flat
could
be
put
right
into
our
and
we
hardly
notice
it
at
that
and
stevens
says
in
the
winter
he
nearly
freezes
to
death
but
i
ca
believe
it
all
day
friday
he
kept
me
tearing
from
shop
to
shop
buying
more
clothes
than
i
can
wear
out
in
a
lifetime
i
believe
lots
of
them
things
never
even
seen
or
heard
of
before
some
of
the
suits
had
to
be
altered
a
little
so
in
the
afternoon
we
went
back
to
the
same
places
we
been
to
in
the
morning
and
tried
the
blamed
things
on
again
how
women
can
like
that
sort
of
thing
is
beyond
me
i
rather
dig
potatoes
all
day
by
five
i
was
so
tired
that
i
was
ready
to
lie
right
down
on
fifth
avenue
and
let
the
passing
crowds
walk
over
me
if
they
liked
but
stevens
hustled
me
into
a
huge
hotel
called
the
waldorf
for
a
and
tea
which
is
a
good
square
meal
but
a
little
something
to
drink
along
with
a
piece
of
as
thick
through
as
and
then
out
again
to
see
a
few
sights
before
we
went
home
to
dress
for
an
early
dinner
and
go
to
the
theatre
in
the
evening
dressing
meant
struggling
into
my
new
i
hoped
it
would
arrive
in
time
but
stevens
had
had
it
marked
rush
and
it
did
i
felt
like
a
fool
when
i
got
it
on
and
a
pretty
hot
uncomfortable
fool
to
boot
stevens
apologized
for
the
show
saying
there
was
really
nothing
in
town
at
this
time
of
year
but
you
can
imagine
what
it
seemed
like
to
me
i
be
almost
willing
to
wear
pink
tights
same
as
a
good
many
of
the
actresses
did
if
it
meant
having
such
a
glorious
time
it
was
almost
ten
saturday
morning
when
i
waked
up
and
of
course
i
felt
like
a
fool
again
but
that
is
getting
to
be
such
a
habitual
state
with
me
that
i
do
need
to
keep
wasting
paper
by
mentioning
it
by
the
time
i
was
washed
and
shaved
and
dressed
stevens
had
been
to
his
office
transacted
all
the
business
necessary
for
the
day
and
was
ready
to
see
sights
again
it
does
take
long
to
do
things
when
you
get
the
hang
of
hustling
he
said
referring
to
his
own
transactions
come
along
we
got
a
couple
of
hours
before
lunch
and
then
we
take
the
train
down
to
my
farm
so
we
shot
downstairs
about
forty
flights
to
the
second
in
the
elevator
hailed
a
passing
taxicab
jumped
in
and
were
tearing
out
riverside
drive
much
too
fast
to
see
anything
in
no
time
we
had
lunch
at
a
big
restaurant
called
delmonico
a
great
deal
to
eat
and
not
half
enough
time
to
eat
it
in
then
took
another
taxi
and
made
our
train
by
catching
on
to
the
last
car
i
do
need
to
tell
you
about
the
farm
because
you
know
all
about
that
already
i
never
left
jenkins
heels
one
second
and
he
said
i
was
much
more
of
a
nuisance
than
thomas
because
thomas
caught
on
to
things
naturally
and
i
asked
questions
all
the
time
i
do
believe
i
see
anything
in
europe
to
beat
that
place
when
we
get
to
milking
our
cows
and
separating
our
cream
and
doing
our
cleaning
by
electricity
it
be
something
like
wo
it
we
took
a
seven
train
back
to
new
york
this
morning
so
that
stevens
could
get
to
his
office
by
nine
and
he
had
me
go
with
him
and
wait
around
until
he
was
at
leisure
again
i
certainly
thought
the
stenographers
fingers
would
fly
off
and
all
the
office
boys
moved
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
really
the
slowest
things
in
the
rooms
were
the
electric
fans
whizzing
around
by
eleven
stevens
had
dictated
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
letters
sold
several
million
dollars
worth
of
property
he
a
broker
and
was
all
ready
to
go
out
with
me
to
buy
more
socks
neckties
handkerchiefs
having
decided
that
i
did
have
enough
we
had
lunch
at
sherry
another
swell
restaurant
and
took
a
trip
up
the
hudson
in
the
afternoon
getting
back
at
ten
just
in
time
said
stevens
to
look
in
at
a
before
we
go
to
bed
so
we
looked
and
it
sure
was
worth
a
passing
glance
and
then
some
it
one
in
the
morning
now
and
i
sail
at
nine
so
i
writing
at
this
hour
in
desperation
or
you
wo
get
any
letter
at
all
much
love
to
everybody
i
picture
you
all
peacefully
sleeping
except
thomas
of
course
with
no
such
word
as
hurry
in
your
minds
austin
amsterdam
september
dear
sally
it
does
seem
possible
that
i
going
to
land
the
first
two
days
out
were
pretty
dreadful
and
i
leave
them
to
your
imagination
there
certainly
was
much
left
of
except
imagination
but
by
the
third
day
i
was
beginning
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
again
and
by
the
fourth
i
was
enjoying
myself
more
than
i
ever
did
in
all
my
life
before
there
a
fellow
on
board
named
arthur
brown
who
has
his
sister
emily
with
him
they
both
unmarried
and
well
over
thirty
teachers
in
a
small
western
college
and
are
starting
out
on
their
sabbatical
year
seeing
them
together
has
made
me
think
a
lot
about
you
and
wish
you
were
along
they
very
little
money
and
have
never
been
to
europe
before
and
almost
every
night
they
sit
down
and
figure
out
how
they
going
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
trip
trying
new
plans
and
itineraries
all
the
time
they
get
into
such
gales
of
laughter
over
it
that
you
think
being
poor
was
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
and
the
tales
they
told
about
working
their
way
through
high
school
and
college
and
saving
up
to
come
to
europe
would
be
pathetic
if
they
were
so
screamingly
funny
i
have
been
gone
very
long
yet
i
know
but
it
been
long
enough
for
me
to
decide
that
sylvia
sent
me
off
not
primarily
to
buy
cows
and
study
agriculture
but
to
learn
a
few
things
that
will
be
a
darned
sight
better
worth
knowing
than
that
even
and
have
a
good
in
the
hope
of
course
that
i
come
home
not
only
less
green
but
less
cussedly
disagreeable
stevens
has
crossed
on
this
boat
twice
and
introduced
me
to
both
the
captain
and
the
chief
engineer
before
i
started
they
both
been
awfully
kind
to
me
and
i
seen
the
inwards
and
outwards
of
the
ship
from
garret
to
cellar
so
to
speak
and
learned
enough
about
navigation
and
machinery
to
make
me
want
to
learn
a
lot
more
but
even
without
all
this
there
would
have
been
plenty
to
do
this
is
a
fashionable
line
so
they
say
but
it
a
good
deal
more
fashionable
than
anything
we
ever
saw
in
hamstead
vermont
there
dancing
every
evening
not
a
bit
like
what
we
have
at
home
and
it
really
made
me
gasp
a
little
at
first
you
thought
i
was
hard
to
shock
too
did
you
well
believe
me
i
blushed
the
first
time
i
discovered
that
i
was
expected
to
hold
my
partner
so
tight
that
you
could
get
a
sheet
of
paper
between
us
however
i
soon
stopped
blushing
and
bent
all
my
energies
to
the
agreeable
task
of
learning
instead
and
the
girls
are
all
so
friendly
and
jolly
that
i
believe
i
getting
the
hang
of
the
new
ways
pretty
well
there
are
no
square
dances
at
all
and
very
few
waltzes
or
but
two
newer
ones
the
and
hold
the
floor
literally
and
figuratively
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
dresses
to
you
they
so
pretty
but
i
ca
a
bit
except
to
say
that
they
rather
startled
me
at
first
too
they
appear
to
be
made
out
of
about
one
yard
of
material
and
none
of
that
yard
goes
to
sleeves
and
not
much
to
waist
a
very
lively
young
lady
sits
next
to
me
at
the
table
and
i
worried
incessantly
at
first
as
to
what
would
happen
if
her
should
break
but
apparently
they
are
stronger
than
they
look
when
they
the
girls
i
mean
feel
a
little
chilly
on
deck
they
put
on
scarves
of
tulle
a
gauzy
stuff
about
half
as
thick
as
mosquito
netting
i
do
quite
see
why
they
not
all
dead
of
pneumonia
but
they
seem
to
thrive
i
also
learned
or
am
trying
to
learn
to
play
a
game
of
cards
called
bridge
it
along
the
same
lines
as
good
old
but
considerably
dressed
up
i
like
that
too
but
feel
pretty
stupid
at
it
as
most
of
the
players
can
remember
every
for
six
hands
back
and
hold
dreadful
of
their
opponents
mistakes
at
the
end
of
the
game
i
brought
along
the
old
french
grammar
i
had
in
high
school
as
well
as
some
new
that
stevens
gave
me
and
take
them
to
bed
with
me
to
study
every
night
for
he
told
me
that
you
could
get
along
anywhere
if
you
knew
french
there
a
library
aboard
too
so
i
read
several
novels
and
i
getting
used
to
my
clothes
i
believe
i
got
too
many
after
all
and
to
taking
a
cold
bath
every
morning
and
shaving
at
least
once
a
day
make
fred
toe
the
mark
while
i
not
there
to
look
after
you
but
remember
he
a
good
sort
just
the
same
i
was
an
awful
fool
ever
to
advise
you
not
to
stick
to
him
he
worth
a
dozen
of
his
cousin
tell
molly
she
have
to
do
some
practising
to
come
up
to
the
way
some
of
the
girls
on
this
ship
play
but
i
believe
she
got
more
talent
than
all
of
them
put
together
if
she
only
work
hard
enough
to
develop
it
going
to
be
an
good
time
as
it
the
last
one
and
looking
forward
to
dancing
my
heels
off
love
to
you
all
especially
mother
and
tell
her
i
have
seen
a
doughnut
since
i
left
home
affectionately
your
brother
austin
paris
october
dear
thomas
i
got
here
last
night
and
found
the
cable
from
father
saying
that
the
cattle
and
dutch
peter
had
reached
new
york
all
right
and
that
he
had
met
them
there
i
know
you
like
peter
and
i
hope
we
can
keep
him
indefinitely
though
i
only
hired
him
to
take
the
cows
over
and
stay
until
those
holstein
aristocrats
were
properly
acclimated
to
the
homestead
i
glad
they
got
there
and
gosh
i
glad
i
got
i
realize
i
been
a
pretty
poor
correspondent
sending
just
picture
and
now
and
then
a
note
to
mother
but
you
see
i
crowded
every
minute
so
darned
full
and
then
i
never
had
much
practice
so
before
i
start
out
to
do
paris
i
practice
a
little
on
you
i
landed
at
rotterdam
had
hours
there
with
emily
and
arthur
brown
that
brother
and
sister
i
met
on
shipboard
then
we
separated
they
going
to
antwerp
and
i
heading
straight
for
the
hague
to
present
sylvia
letter
of
introduction
to
little
the
american
minister
shaking
in
my
shoes
and
cold
perspiration
running
down
my
back
of
course
but
i
need
have
shook
and
sweat
as
our
friend
elliott
says
for
he
was
expecting
me
and
was
kindness
itself
he
found
an
interpreter
to
go
through
the
farming
district
with
me
and
then
he
invited
me
to
come
and
stay
at
his
house
for
a
few
days
before
i
started
for
the
interior
he
has
a
son
about
my
age
who
i
imagine
has
suffered
from
the
same
form
of
heart
disease
with
which
you
are
afflicted
at
present
as
he
seemed
to
be
somewhat
affected
every
time
sylvia
name
was
mentioned
and
a
daughter
flora
an
awfully
friendly
jolly
creature
fortunately
she
informed
me
promptly
that
she
was
engaged
to
a
fellow
in
paris
or
i
might
have
got
heart
disease
too
they
kept
me
on
the
jump
every
minute
and
parties
and
excursions
of
all
sorts
and
one
night
we
went
to
see
a
play
of
shakespeare
the
two
gentlemen
of
verona
given
in
dutch
i
find
that
all
continentals
admire
him
immensely
and
give
frequent
performances
of
his
works
get
out
our
old
copy
and
it
some
rainy
day
you
probably
rusty
on
it
same
as
i
was
but
it
an
interesting
tale
and
there
a
song
in
it
that
ca
help
appealing
to
you
here
the
first
verse
who
is
sylvia
what
is
she
that
all
the
swains
commend
her
holy
fair
and
wise
is
she
the
heavens
such
grace
did
lend
her
that
she
might
admired
be
i
advise
you
to
invest
in
doublet
hose
plumed
hat
and
guitar
and
try
the
effect
of
a
serenade
under
our
sylvia
beg
pardon
window
the
fellow
in
the
play
made
a
great
hit
so
there
no
telling
what
you
might
accomplish
i
hated
leaving
the
littles
for
the
good
time
i
had
there
sure
beat
the
good
time
i
had
on
shipboard
to
a
frazzle
but
i
soon
found
out
that
the
business
part
of
the
trip
was
going
to
be
a
good
deal
more
interesting
and
absorbing
than
i
had
imagined
it
would
be
my
interpreter
hans
roorda
a
fellow
several
years
younger
than
i
am
can
speak
five
languages
all
equally
well
and
i
kept
him
busy
talking
french
to
me
we
were
in
the
country
almost
three
weeks
the
farmers
have
half
the
mechanical
conveniences
that
we
considered
absolutely
necessary
even
in
our
least
prosperous
days
but
are
marvels
of
order
and
efficiency
for
all
that
i
believe
one
of
the
greatest
mistakes
that
we
new
england
farmers
have
been
making
is
to
assume
that
farming
is
a
mixture
of
three
fourths
muscle
and
one
fourth
brains
i
beginning
to
think
it
the
other
way
around
as
you
have
already
learned
i
followed
jenkins
advice
bought
a
dozen
head
of
fine
cattle
and
hired
peter
kuyp
the
son
of
one
of
the
farmers
i
visited
to
take
care
of
them
of
course
this
meant
going
back
to
rotterdam
to
see
them
safely
off
and
i
managed
to
get
a
glimpse
of
some
of
the
other
dutch
cities
as
well
when
i
got
to
amsterdam
i
parted
from
roorda
with
real
regret
for
i
feel
one
of
the
many
good
friends
i
already
made
i
found
my
first
american
mail
in
amsterdam
among
other
letters
one
from
you
the
news
from
home
in
it
was
all
fine
i
glad
father
has
sold
that
old
blue
hill
pasture
it
was
too
far
off
from
the
rest
of
our
land
to
be
of
much
real
use
to
us
and
i
also
think
he
was
dead
right
to
use
the
money
he
got
from
it
to
pay
off
old
debts
stevens
writes
me
that
he
has
sold
sylvia
long
island
house
for
her
and
that
her
horses
carriages
sleighs
and
motor
are
all
going
up
to
the
homestead
now
that
the
holsteins
are
there
too
why
do
you
sell
the
few
old
cows
and
the
two
horses
that
we
rescued
from
the
fire
and
use
that
money
in
paying
off
more
debts
if
the
mortgage
were
only
out
of
the
way
with
all
the
other
improvements
you
speak
of
well
started
i
should
think
we
were
headed
straight
for
millionaires
row
i
also
found
a
letter
from
little
in
amsterdam
saying
that
little
and
flora
were
about
to
start
for
paris
and
asking
if
i
would
care
to
act
as
their
escort
since
neither
he
nor
his
son
could
leave
the
hague
just
then
simply
a
kind
way
of
saying
here
another
chance
for
you
of
course
you
can
imagine
the
answer
i
telegraphed
him
we
broke
the
journey
in
brussels
and
antwerp
and
i
saw
no
end
of
new
wonders
of
course
and
in
brussels
we
went
to
the
opera
i
did
wish
molly
was
there
for
she
certainly
would
have
thought
she
had
struck
heaven
and
i
did
pretty
nearly
i
getting
used
to
my
and
it
is
quite
such
an
exquisite
piece
of
torture
to
do
my
tie
as
it
was
at
first
since
flora
did
it
for
me
one
night
and
gave
me
some
little
hints
for
the
future
she
is
really
an
awfully
jolly
girl
we
got
to
paris
late
at
night
and
i
never
shall
forget
the
long
drive
from
the
station
through
the
bright
streets
to
the
fessendens
house
where
the
littles
were
going
to
visit
sylvia
had
given
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
them
too
but
i
did
need
to
use
it
for
of
course
i
got
introduced
to
them
then
and
there
there
are
three
fellows
no
girls
in
the
family
besides
and
mrs
i
knew
beforehand
that
flora
was
engaged
to
one
of
them
but
i
could
tell
which
for
they
all
fell
upon
her
and
embraced
her
with
about
equal
enthusiasm
then
they
all
kissed
little
and
little
and
fessenden
hugged
each
other
and
fessenden
hugged
flora
i
began
to
think
that
perhaps
i
might
be
included
by
mistake
but
all
my
hopes
were
in
vain
i
was
invited
to
come
to
dinner
the
next
night
however
and
then
i
took
my
leave
and
drove
round
for
an
hour
it
seemed
like
an
hour
in
fairyland
before
i
went
back
to
my
hotel
you
must
be
getting
settled
in
college
now
it
must
have
been
an
awful
wrench
to
tear
yourself
away
from
the
homestead
i
know
but
you
have
a
great
time
after
you
get
over
the
first
pangs
of
separation
i
sure
and
do
forget
that
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
i
refer
of
course
to
sylvia
heart
because
you
made
it
sufficiently
plain
to
all
of
us
that
yours
well
the
best
of
luck
go
with
you
austin
southampton
october
dear
sylvia
i
had
a
feeling
in
my
bones
when
i
woke
up
this
morning
that
something
extra
pleasant
was
going
to
happen
and
when
i
got
down
to
breakfast
and
saw
on
the
top
of
my
pile
of
mail
a
letter
postmarked
hamstead
but
in
a
strange
handwriting
i
knew
that
it
happened
you
begin
by
scolding
me
because
i
have
written
mother
oftener
i
know
i
deserve
it
and
i
write
her
from
now
on
every
sunday
at
least
but
then
you
go
on
by
asking
why
i
never
written
you
except
the
little
note
i
sent
back
by
the
pilot
which
you
say
is
not
a
note
at
all
but
a
series
of
repetitions
of
unmerited
thanks
i
have
written
because
i
did
feel
that
i
you
wanted
to
be
bothered
with
me
and
how
can
i
write
and
not
say
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
with
every
line
why
i
learned
more
enjoyed
more
more
in
these
two
months
since
i
came
to
europe
than
i
had
in
all
the
rest
of
my
life
before
sylvia
but
i
wo
if
you
do
like
it
now
to
answer
your
question
what
have
i
been
doing
all
this
time
i
feel
sure
you
seen
what
i
have
written
so
you
know
what
a
wonderful
trip
i
had
from
the
hague
to
paris
i
glad
i
have
got
to
try
to
describe
paris
to
you
for
of
course
you
know
it
much
better
than
i
do
but
i
hope
some
day
when
my
mind
a
little
calmer
i
can
describe
it
to
the
rest
of
the
family
just
now
i
not
in
any
state
yet
to
separate
the
details
from
the
wild
magnificent
jumble
of
picture
galleries
and
churches
tombs
and
palaces
parks
and
gardens
wonderful
broad
bright
streets
theatres
cafes
and
of
course
all
your
letters
were
the
main
reason
that
every
one
was
so
nice
to
me
my
first
day
of
ended
with
a
perfectly
uproarious
dinner
at
the
fessendens
i
never
in
my
life
ran
into
such
a
jolly
crowd
i
finally
discovered
which
brother
flora
belonged
to
which
had
been
puzzling
me
a
good
deal
before
because
about
ten
the
other
two
suggested
that
we
should
go
out
and
see
if
we
could
have
a
little
fun
i
thought
we
were
having
a
good
deal
right
there
but
of
course
i
agreed
so
we
went
and
we
did
then
during
the
next
ten
days
i
went
to
mass
at
the
madeleine
and
to
a
ball
at
the
american
embassy
i
rode
on
the
top
of
and
spun
around
in
motors
we
took
some
trips
out
into
the
country
and
saw
not
only
the
famous
places
like
versailles
and
fontainebleau
but
lots
of
big
beautiful
private
estates
with
farms
attached
there
none
of
the
spotless
shininess
of
holland
or
the
beautiful
cattle
there
but
agriculture
is
developed
to
the
degree
for
all
that
those
french
farmers
wring
more
out
of
one
acre
than
we
do
out
of
ten
but
going
to
do
some
wringing
in
hamstead
vermont
in
the
future
i
can
tell
you
the
last
night
in
paris
i
never
went
to
bed
at
all
twenty
of
us
had
dinner
at
the
café
de
la
paix
went
to
the
theatre
saw
the
girls
and
fathers
and
mothers
home
then
went
off
with
the
other
fellows
to
another
show
which
lasted
until
three
i
had
barely
time
to
rush
back
to
the
hotel
collect
my
belongings
and
catch
my
early
train
for
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
that
so
that
i
could
stop
off
for
two
hours
at
rouen
on
my
way
to
calais
and
i
was
glad
i
did
though
i
must
confess
i
yawned
a
good
deal
even
while
i
was
looking
at
the
cathedral
and
the
relics
of
joan
of
arc
i
had
just
a
week
in
the
channel
islands
and
though
i
did
think
beforehand
that
i
could
possibly
get
as
much
out
of
them
as
i
did
out
of
the
country
in
holland
of
course
i
found
that
i
was
mistaken
i
bought
six
head
of
cattle
brought
them
to
southampton
with
me
and
saw
them
safely
embarked
for
america
as
i
cabled
father
i
suppose
they
got
there
by
now
they
beauties
but
i
believe
i
going
to
like
the
holsteins
better
just
the
same
they
larger
and
sturdier
less
nervous
and
give
more
milk
though
it
not
nearly
so
rich
the
browns
met
me
there
and
i
was
awfully
glad
to
see
them
again
i
bought
a
knapsack
and
leaving
all
my
good
clothes
behind
me
started
out
with
them
on
a
week
walking
trip
through
the
isle
of
wight
getting
back
here
only
last
night
we
stopped
overnight
at
any
place
we
happened
to
be
near
usually
a
farmhouse
and
the
next
morning
pursued
our
way
again
with
a
lunch
put
up
by
our
latest
hostess
in
our
pockets
of
course
the
browns
did
take
the
same
interest
in
farming
that
i
did
but
they
had
a
fine
time
too
it
been
a
great
thing
for
me
to
know
them
especially
emily
she
not
a
bit
pretty
or
the
sort
that
a
fellow
could
get
crazy
over
or
well
i
ca
describe
it
but
you
know
what
i
mean
every
man
who
meets
her
must
realize
what
a
fine
wife
she
make
for
somebody
and
yet
he
would
want
her
himself
but
she
a
wonderful
friend
do
you
know
i
never
had
a
woman
friend
before
or
realized
that
there
could
be
such
a
thing
for
a
man
i
mean
unless
there
was
some
sentiment
mixed
up
with
it
this
is
the
least
of
the
valuable
lessons
i
learned
after
lunch
we
going
off
again
not
on
foot
this
time
as
it
would
take
too
long
to
see
what
we
want
to
that
way
but
on
hired
bicycles
i
sending
my
baggage
ahead
to
london
to
await
arrival
but
if
the
mild
though
rather
rainy
weather
we
had
so
far
holds
i
hope
to
have
two
weeks
more
of
england
before
i
go
there
we
have
no
definite
plans
but
expect
to
go
to
some
of
the
cathedral
towns
and
to
oxford
and
warwick
at
least
and
now
i
overstayed
the
time
you
first
thought
i
should
be
gone
already
and
yet
i
going
to
close
my
letter
by
quoting
the
last
lines
in
yours
if
you
need
more
money
cable
for
it
i
do
i
begun
to
spend
all
i
had
do
hurry

you
can
comfortably
and
thoroughly
and
if
you
decide
you
want
to
go
somewhere
that
we
plan
at
first
or
stay
longer
than
you
originally
intended
please
do
the
family
is
well
the
building
going
along
finely
and
peter
your
dutch
boy
most
efficient
by
the
way
we
all
like
him
immensely
this
is
your
chance
take
it
well
i
going
to
after
the
browns
leave
london
they
going
to
italy
for
the
winter
and
they
want
me
to
go
with

for
a
few
weeks
before

start
home
i
sail
from
naples
getting
home
for
christmas

a
christmas

more

would
surely
begin
to
crop
out
ever
yours
faithfully
austin
gray
chapter
vii
the
first
of
october
found
a
very
quiet
household
at
the
old
gray
homestead
austin
was
in
europe
thomas
had
gone
to
college
at
burlington
molly
to
the
conservatory
of
music
in
boston
sally
had
prudently
decided
to
teach
for
another
year
before
getting
married
and
now
that
she
could
keep
all
her
earnings
was
happily
saving
them
for
her
modest
trousseau
she
boarded
in
wallacetown
where
she
taught
coming
home
only
for
saturdays
and
sundays
while
katherine
and
edith
were
in
high
school
and
gone
all
day
gray
declared
that
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
herself
she
had
so
much
spare
time
on
her
hands
with
so
many
modern
improvements
and
such
a
small
family
in
the
house
go
with
gray
on
the
excursion
to
boston
said
sylvia
he
told
me
that
you
had
been
off
together
since
you
took
your
wedding
trip
that
will
give
you
a
chance
to
look
in
on
molly
too
and
see
how
she
behaving
and
you
have
a
nice
little
spree
besides
i
look
after
the
family
and
peter
can
look
after
the
cows
sylvia
had
recovered
rapidly
from
her
illness
and
her
former
shyness
and
aversion
to
seeing
people
were
rapidly
leaving
her
she
no
longer
lay
in
bed
until
noon
but
was
up
with
the
rest
of
the
family
insisting
on
doing
her
share
in
the
housework
and
proving
a
very
apt
pupil
in
learning
that
useful
and
wrongly
despised
art
when
callers
came
she
always
dropped
in
to
chat
with
them
a
little
while
and
even
the
of
the
rural
delivery
route
number
two
the
on
the
wagon
from
harrington
general
store
and
all
the
agents
for
flavoring
extracts
and
celluloid
toilet
sets
and
bibles
for
miles
around
were
not
infrequently
found
lingering
on
the
back
porch
passing
the
time
of
day
with
her
whether
they
had
any
excuse
of
mail
or
merchandise
or
not
not
infrequently
she
went
to
spend
the
day
with
elliott
or
with
ruth
and
to
church
on
sunday
with
all
the
family
and
although
perhaps
she
was
not
sorry
at
heart
that
her
deep
mourning
gave
her
an
excuse
for
not
attending
the
village
parties
and
socials
she
never
said
so
the
library
the
grange
and
the
village
improvement
society
all
found
her
ready
and
eager
to
help
them
in
their
struggles
to
raise
money
provide
better
quarters
for
themselves
or
get
up
entertainments
and
the
methodist
minister
was
the
first
person
to
meet
with
a
flat
refusal
to
his
demands
upon
her
purse
he
was
as
a
successful
solicitor
and
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
that
sylvia
was
probably
sent
by
providence
to
provide
the
needed
repairs
upon
the
church
and
parsonage
and
the
increase
in
his
own
salary
he
called
upon
her
and
graciously
informed
her
of
his
plan
the
lord
has
been
pleased
to
make
you
the
steward
of
great
riches
he
said
unctuously
and
i
feel
sure
there
is
no
way
you
could
spend
them
which
would
be
more
pleasing
in
his
sight
than
that
which
i
have
just
suggested
i
agree
with
you
perfectly
that
the
church
is
in
a
disgraceful
state
of
disrepair
said
sylvia
calmly
and
that
your
salary
is
quite
inadequate
to
live
on
properly
i
have
often
wondered
how
your
congregation
could
worship
reverently
in
such
a
place
or
allow
their
pastor
to
be
so
poorly
housed
i
believe
the
bible
commands
us
somewhere
to
do
things
decently
and
in
order
you
are
quite
right
cary
quite
right
then
may
i
understand
wait
just
a
minute
i
have
also
wondered
at
the
lack
of
proper
pride
your
congregation
seemed
to
show
in
such
matters
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
it
would
really
help
matters
very
much
if
i
a
complete
outsider
not
even
a
member
of
your
communion
furnished
all
the
necessary
funds
to
do
what
you
wish
your
flock
would
sit
back
harder
than
ever
and
wait
for
some
one
else
to
turn
up
and
do
likewise
when
i
have
gone
and
probably
that
second
millionaire
would
never
materialize
and
you
would
be
left
worse
off
than
before
even
my
dear
lady
exclaimed
the
divine
amazed
and
distressed
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
most
of
the
members
of
my
congregation
are
in
very
moderate
circumstances
i
know
but
they
should
do
and
there
are
some
who
for
a
small
village
are
rich
and
just
plain
stingy
why
do
you
go
to
them
unfortunately
that
would
only
result
in
the
entire
withdrawal
of
their
support
i
fear
and
those
are
the
worthy
struggling
christians
whom
you
wish
me
to
supply
with
everything
to
make
their
church
beautiful
and
their
minister
comfortable
you
want
me
to
put
a
premium
on
stinginess
i
sha
give
you
one
cent
under
those
conditions
go
to
the
three
richest
men
in
your
church
and
say
to
them
sum
you
will
give
cary
will
double
appeal
to
your
congregation
as
a
whole
and
tell
it
the
same
thing
ask
those
who
you
know
have
no
cash
to
spare
to
give
some
of
their
time
at
whatever
it
is
worth
by
the
hour
or
the
day
set
the
children
to
arranging
for
a
concert
i
suppose
you
would
approve
of
a
little
play
and
see
how
the
relatives
and
friends
will
flock
to
hear
it
gladly
drill
them
when
you
tried
all
this
and
the
response
has
been
generous
and
hearty
if
still
you
have
all
you
need
i
gladly
lend
you
the
remainder
of
the
sum
without
interest
and
you
may
take
your
own
time
in
discharging
the
debt
that
is
a
young
lady
who
gives
a
man
much
food
for
thought
remarked
the
minister
to
gray
as
somewhat
abashed
but
greatly
impressed
he
was
leaving
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
very
true
in
more
ways
than
one
her
person
is
not
unpleasing
and
she
seems
to
have
an
agile
mind
continued
jessup
gray
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile
later
he
teased
sylvia
about
her
new
conquest
i
am
afraid
he
said
his
mouth
twitching
that
you
would
flirt
with
a
stone
post
i
did
flirt
with
said
sylvia
indignantly
he
ended
the
call
by
dropping
on
his
knees
right
there
in
my
and
saying
us
pray
for
new
hearts
well
i
had
lots
of
calls
end
with
a
prayer
for
a
change
of
heart
you
little
wretch
what
did
you
do
do
i
always
strive
to
please
i
knelt
down
beside
him
of
course
and
then
he
took
my
hand
so
i
honestly
i
do
care
much
what
men
if
they
only
say
it
but
i
draw
the
line
at
being
if
that
your
idea
of
a
flirtation
it
is
mine
look
out
my
dear
warned
howard
he
a
widower
and
a
famous
beggar
and
sylvia
laughed
with
him
during
the
first
months
she
had
never
laughed
i
am
getting
to
love
that
child
as
if
she
were
my
own
he
said
to
his
wife
later
whatever
shall
we
do
when
she
goes
away
it
wo
be
long
now
you
see
mercy
do
you
even
speak
of
it
rejoined
gray
but
she
too
was
brooding
over
the
possibility
in
secret
are
you
sure
quite
contented
here
sylvia
she
asked
anxiously
the
next
time
they
were
alone
sylvia
laid
down
the
dish
she
was
wiping
and
came
and
laid
her
cheek
now
growing
softly
pink
again
against
gray
contented
she
echoed
why
i
i
happy
i
never
was
happy
in
my
whole
life
before
but
i
shall
freeze
to
death
here
this
winter
unless
you
let
me
put
a
furnace
in
this
great
house
and
i
want
to
glass
in
part
of
the
big
piazza
and
have
a
tiny
little
conservatory
for
your
plants
built
off
the
do
you
mind
if
i
tear
up
the
place
that
much
more
been
so
patient
about
it
so
far
gray
could
only
throw
up
her
hands
the
spree
to
boston
took
place
and
proved
wonderfully
delightful
and
then
they
all
settled
down
quietly
for
the
winter
looking
forward
to
christmas
as
the
time
that
was
to
bring
the
entire
family
together
again
for
even
james
the
eldest
son
had
written
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
and
should
come
home
with
his
bride
for
the
holidays
for
his
wedding
trip
and
as
sylvia
still
firmly
refused
to
leave
the
farm
stevens
asked
for
permission
to
join
austin
when
he
landed
and
be
with
his
niece
over
the
great
day
as
the
time
drew
near
the
house
was
hung
with
garlands
and
every
window
proudly
displayed
a
great
laurel
wreath
tied
with
a
huge
red
bow
sylvia
moved
all
her
belongings
into
her
parlor
and
decorated
her
bedroom
for
the
bride
and
groom
and
went
about
the
house
singing
as
she
unpacked
great
boxes
and
trimmed
a
mammoth
christmas
tree
four
days
before
christmas
and
james
gray
arrived
and
james
was
promptly
pronounced
to
be
all
right
by
her
husband
family
though
the
poor
girl
of
course
underwent
tortures
before
she
was
sure
of
their
decision
fred
who
with
his
father
and
mother
was
to
join
in
the
great
feast
brought
sally
home
from
wallacetown
that
same
night
and
took
advantage
of
the
mistletoe
which
sylvia
had
hung
up
right
before
them
all
thomas
and
molly
both
wonderfully
citified
already
appeared
during
the
course
of
the
next
afternoon
from
opposite
directions
and
molly
played
and
thomas
expounded
scientific
farming
to
the
wonder
of
them
all
and
finally
gray
went
to
meet
the
midnight
train
from
new
york
at
wallacetown
the
night
before
christmas
eve
and
found
himself
being
squeezed
half
to
pieces
by
the
bear
hugs
of
austin
and
the
hearty
handshakes
of
stevens
pile
right
into
the
sleigh
he
managed
to
say
at
last
when
he
was
partially
released
but
still
gasping
for
breath
we
must
stand
fooling
around
here
with
the
thermometer
at
twenty
below
zero
and
a
whole
houseful
waiting
to
treat
you
the
same
way
you
treated
me
austin
seems
as
if
you
were
bigger
than
ever
and
you
got
a
different
look
same
as
thomas
and
molly
have
only
yours
is
more
different
there
was
more
room
for
improvement
in
my
case
his
son
laughed
back
throwing
his
arm
around
him
again
my
but
it
good
to
see
you
talk
about
changes
you
look
ten
years
younger
does
he
stevens
mother
and
and
thomas
and
the
girls
and
and
peter
yes
how
is
said
stevens
why
peter
all
right
returned
gray
soberly
what
makes
you
ask
that
sort
is
never
sick
and
he
as
good
and
steady
a
boy
as
i
ever
saw
i
so
glad
to
hear
it
murmured
stevens
in
an
interested
voice
and
we
had
the
biggest
creamery
check
this
month
austin
went
on
his
father
that
we
had
with
just
those
few
cows
you
sent
peter
tends
them
as
if
they
were
young
girls
being
dressed
up
for
their
sweethearts
the
hens
are
laying
well
too
right
through
this
cold
weather
the
poultry
house
is
so
clean
and
warm
they
do
seem
to
know
that
it
winter
we
have
enough
eggs
for
our
own
use
and
some
to
sell
besides
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
to
sell
week
will
there
you
like
james
wife
i
sure
austin
and
you
too
stevens
she
a
nice
healthy
jolly
girl
with
good
sense
i
sure
she
not
as
pretty
as
my
girls
but
then
few
are
of
course
in
my
eyes
it
plain
to
see
they
just
set
their
by
each
other
sadie
and
james
i
mean
and
of
course
fred
is
about
most
of
the
time
so
with
two
pairs
of
lovers
it
keeps
things
lively
i
can
tell
you
has
thomas
recovered
inquired
austin
indeed
he
has
it
mean
of
us
all
to
make
fun
of
him
he
very
much
in
earnest
how
does
sylvia
take
it
asked
sylvia
uncle
i
do
think
she
notices
oh
do
you
said
stevens
in
the
same
interested
tone
he
had
used
before
gray
was
standing
in
the
door
to
receive
them
even
if
it
was
twenty
below
zero
and
was
laughing
and
crying
with
her
great
boy
in
her
arms
before
he
was
half
out
of
the
sleigh
the
kissing
that
had
taken
place
at
the
fessendens
was
nothing
to
that
which
now
occurred
at
the
grays
for
when
he
had
finished
with
his
mother
austin
found
all
his
sisters
waiting
for
him
clamoring
for
the
same
welcome
and
he
ended
with
his
new
and
then
began
all
over
again
meanwhile
stevens
stood
looking
vainly
about
and
finally
interrupted
with
where
girl
oh
mr
stevens
exclaimed
gray
wiping
her
eyes
and
settling
her
hair
it
was
downright
careless
of
me
not
to
tell
you
right
away
but
i
was
so
excited
over
austin
that
i
forgot
all
about
it
for
a
minute
of
course
it
a
dreadful
disappointment
to
you
but
it
just
could
seem
to
be
helped
frank
my
you
know
that
lives
in
white
water
telephoned
down
this
morning
that
the
trained
nurse
had
left
an
little
elsie
was
ailin
an
the
hired
girl
so
green
nothin
would
do
but
that
sylvia
must
traipse
up
there
to
help
ruth
before
i
could
say
robinson
what
do
you
mean
thundered
uncle
mat
and
austin
in
the
same
breath
so
gray
tried
again
why
ruth
had
a
new
baby
a
month
ago
another
little
girl
an
the
dearest
child
they
all
comin
home
sure
the
world
you
see
her
then
they
named
her
mary
for
me
an
of
course
real
pleased
but
as
i
was
sayin
it
did
seem
as
if
some
one
had
got
to
take
hold
an
help
them
get
straightened
out
if
they
was
goin
to
put
it
through
an
of
course
there
no
one
like
sylvia
for
jobs
like
that
land
i
do
know
how
we
ever
got
along
before
she
come
anyway
up
there
now
rode
up
with
hiram
on
the
rural
free
delivery
he
was
tickled
most
to
death
she
left
her
love
an
said
maybe
one
of
the
boys
would
take
the
pair
an
her
big
double
sleigh
an
start
up
to
get
all
in
real
good
season
mornin
that
means
me
of
course
said
thomas
importantly
of
course
echoed
both
his
brothers
quite
unanimously
stevens
said
nothing
but
calmly
went
up
to
bed
where
he
apparently
slept
well
as
he
did
not
reappear
until
after
nine
the
following
morning
he
sought
out
gray
in
the
sunny
shining
kitchen
but
did
not
evince
as
much
surprise
as
she
had
expected
when
she
told
him
while
she
bustled
about
preparing
fresh
coffee
and
toast
for
him
that
when
thomas
at
seven
had
gone
to
the
barn
to
hitch
up
he
had
found
that
the
double
sleigh
the
pair
and
austin
had
all
mysteriously
vanished
austin
always
was
a
dreadful
tease
she
ended
but
i
ca
help
this
is
downright
mean
of
him
when
he
knows
how
thomas
feels
my
dear
lady
said
stevens
cracking
open
the
egg
she
had
set
before
him
with
great
care
where
are
your
eyes
what
about
austin
himself
gray
set
down
the
looking
at
him
in
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
i
hope
austin
is
grateful
to
her
now
an
that
he
so
at
first
he
did
like
her
at
all
he
never
taken
to
her
same
as
the
rest
of
us
have
seems
to
feel
she
bossy
an
meddlesome
howard
an
i
have
spoken
of
it
a
thousand
times
he
began
by
resenting
everything
she
did
an
then
got
so
he
did
even
mention
her
name
exactly
i
noticed
that
myself
i
do
pretend
to
be
an
infallible
judge
of
human
nature
but
mark
my
words
austin
has
cared
for
my
sylvia
since
the
first
moment
he
ever
set
eyes
on
her
no
man
likes
to
feel
that
the
woman
he
in
love
with
is
doing
everything
for
him
and
his
family
and
that
he
ca
as
he
sees
it
do
anything
in
return
that
why
he
seems
to
resent
her
kindness
which
i
really
think
the
rest
of
you
have
almost
overestimated
if
she
helped
you
in
material
ways
you
been
her
salvation
in
greater
ways
still
but
still
more
to
it
than
that
i
think
your
son
austin
has
in
him
the
makings
of
one
of
the
finest
men
i
ever
knew
but
he
does
consider
himself
worthy
of
her
he
try
to
conceal
and
even
to
conquer
his
feelings
just
as
long
as
he
possibly
can
i
suppose
he
believes
that
be
always
of
course
it
wo
but
naturally
he
ca
bear
to
talk
about
her
thomas
has
fallen
in
love
with
her
face
which
is
pretty
and
her
manner
which
is
charming
after
the
manner
of
most
men
but
austin
has
fallen
in
love
with
her
mind
which
is
brilliant
and
her
soul
which
in
spite
of
some
little
superficial
faults
that
i
believe
he
himself
will
unconsciously
teach
her
to
overcome
is
beautiful
after
the
manner
of
very
few
men
and
those
men
love
but
once
deeply
and
forever
and
so
my
dear
gray
tease
thomas
all
you
like
for
sylvia
will
refuse
thomas
when
he
asks
for
her
and
he
will
be
engaged
to
another
girl
within
a
year
but
she
will
run
away
from
austin
before
he
brings
himself
to
tell
her
how
he
feels
and
it
will
be
many
a
long
day
before
his
heart
is
light
again
chapter
viii
i
fairly
dread
to
have
christmas
come
for
one
reason
had
said
gray
to
her
husband
beforehand
why
i
thought
you
were
counting
the
days
so
i
am
but
i
hate
to
think
of
all
the
presents
sylvia
likely
to
load
us
down
with
seems
as
if
she
done
enough
i
do
want
to
be
beholden
to
her
for
any
more
do
worry
mary
sylvia
got
good
sense
and
delicate
feelings
as
well
as
an
almighty
generous
little
heart
she
be
the
first
to
think
how
we
feel
herself
gray
was
right
when
christmas
came
there
was
a
simple
inexpensive
trinket
for
each
of
the
girls
and
slightly
costlier
ones
for
the
bride
and
gray
little
pocket
calendars
all
just
alike
for
the
men
that
was
all
stevens
had
taken
pleasure
in
bringing
great
baskets
of
candy
adorned
with
elaborate
bows
of
ribbon
and
bunches
of
violets
as
big
as
their
heads
to
all
the
children
a
fine
plant
to
gray
and
books
to
howard
and
his
sons
and
austin
bulged
with
all
sorts
of
little
treasures
which
tumbled
out
from
between
his
clothes
in
the
most
unexpected
places
as
he
unpacked
it
in
the
to
the
great
delight
of
them
all
here
a
of
gray
silk
from
venice
for
mother
he
said
tossing
the
shimmering
bundle
into
her
lap
i
want
her
to
have
it
made
up
to
wear
at
sally
wedding
and
here
lace
for
sadie
and
sally
both
the
bride
and
the
nothing
much
for
the
rest
of
you
and
out
came
strings
of
corals
and
beads
handkerchiefs
and
photographs
silk
stockings
and
filagree
work
until
the
floor
was
strewn
with
pretty
things
after
all
the
presents
were
distributed
it
was
time
to
begin
to
get
dinner
and
to
decorate
the
great
table
laid
for
sixteen
there
was
a
turkey
of
course
and
a
huge
chicken
pie
as
well
not
to
mention
mince
pies
and
squash
pies
and
apple
pies
a
plum
pudding
and
vanilla
angel
cakes
and
fruit
cakes
and
chocolate
cakes
coffee
and
cider
and
blackberry
cordial
and
after
they
had
all
eaten
until
they
could
not
hold
another
mouthful
and
had
rested
up
a
little
sylvia
played
while
they
danced
the
virginia
reel
stevens
leading
off
with
gray
and
gray
with
sadie
and
finally
they
all
gathered
around
the
piano
and
sang
the
good
old
carols
until
it
was
time
for
the
elliotts
to
go
home
and
for
ruth
to
carry
the
sleepy
babies
up
to
bed
since
early
fall
it
had
been
sylvia
custom
to
sit
with
the
family
for
a
time
after
the
early
supper
was
over
and
the
dishes
done
up
then
she
went
to
her
own
parlor
lighted
her
open
fire
and
sat
down
by
herself
to
read
or
write
letters
but
she
always
left
her
door
wide
open
and
it
was
understood
that
any
one
who
wished
to
come
to
her
was
welcome
austin
was
the
last
to
start
to
bed
on
christmas
night
and
seeing
sylvia
still
at
her
desk
as
he
passed
her
room
he
stopped
and
asked
is
it
too
late
or
are
you
too
tired
and
busy
to
let
me
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
she
glanced
at
the
clock
smiling
it
is
very
late
i
not
a
bit
tired
and
in
a
minute
i
sha
be
too
busy
i
been
working
over
some
stupid
documents
that
i
was
bound
to
get
through
with
but
all
done
now
throw
that
rubbish
into
the
fire
for
me
will
you
she
continued
pointing
to
a
pile
of
letters
and
printed
matter
and
draw
up
two
chairs
in
front
of
the
fire
i
join
you
in
a
minute
he
obeyed
then
stood
watching
her
as
she
straightened
out
her
silver
desk
fixtures
gravely
putting
everything
in
perfect
order
before
she
turned
to
him
what
a
beau
cavalier
you
have
become
she
said
smiling
again
as
he
drew
back
to
let
her
pass
in
front
of
him
and
turned
her
chair
to
an
angle
at
which
the
fire
could
not
scorch
her
face
what
become
of
the
old
austin
i
ca
seem
to
find
him
at
all
oh
i
left
him
in
the
woods
the
night
of
the
fire
i
hope
returned
austin
laughing
while
you
were
asleep
i
sure
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
wants
him
back
sylvia
settled
herself
comfortably
and
smoothed
out
the
folds
of
her
silk
dress
would
you
like
to
smoke
she
asked
an
awfully
comfortable
feeling
to
watch
a
man
smoking
in
front
of
an
open
fire
i
love
to
if
you
sure
you
do
mind
i
do
want
to
make
the
air
in
here
heavy
for
i
suppose
you
got
to
sleep
here
on
this
sofa
having
allowed
yourself
to
be
turned
out
of
your
good
bed
she
laughed
i
so
small
that
i
can
curl
up
and
sleep
on
almost
anything
like
a
kitten
she
said
and
it
fine
to
think
of
being
able
to
give
my
room
to
james
and
sadie
they
so
nice
and
so
happy
together
i
can
open
the
windows
wide
for
a
few
minutes
after
gone
and
there
wo
be
a
trace
of
tobacco
smoke
left
if
there
were
i
should
mind
it
now
what
is
it
austin
i
want
to
talk
i
have
seen
you
a
single
minute
alone
and
though
the
others
are
all
interested
it
is
like
telling
things
to
a
person
done
all
the
wonderful
things
and
seen
all
the
wonderful
places
that
i
just
have
i
simply
got
to
let
loose
on
some
one
of
course
you
have
i
thought
that
was
it
talk
away
but
not
too
loud
we
must
disturb
the
others
who
are
all
trying
to
go
to
sleep
by
this
time
tell
me
which
of
the
italian
cities
did
you
like
best
rome
or
florence
or
naples
will
you
think
me
awfully
queer
if
i
say
none
of
them
but
after
venice
the
little
ones
like
assisi
perugia
and
sienna
i
so
glad
we
took
the
time
for
them
oh
and
he
was
off
the
little
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
several
times
unnoticed
by
either
of
them
and
it
was
after
one
when
glancing
inadvertently
at
it
austin
sprang
to
his
feet
apologizing
for
having
kept
her
awake
so
long
and
hastily
bade
her
may
i
come
again
some
evening
and
talk
more
he
asked
with
his
hand
on
the
or
have
i
bored
and
tired
you
to
death
you
a
wonderful
listener
come
as
often
as
you
like
i
been
learning
things
too
that
i
want
to
tell
you
about
for
instance
oh
how
to
cook
and
sweep
and
sew
and
how
to
be
well
and
happy
and
at
peace
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
then
speaking
lightly
again
try
to
keep
up
that
french
you
worked
so
hard
at
together
dreadfully
out
of
practice
myself
and
read
some
of
browning
italian
poems
if
you
would
care
to
goodnight
and
again
merry
christmas
he
left
her
almost
in
a
daze
of
excitement
and
happiness
and
mounted
the
stairs
turning
over
everything
that
had
been
said
and
done
during
the
two
hours
since
he
entered
her
room
as
he
reached
the
top
a
sudden
suspicion
shot
through
him
he
stopped
short
almost
breathlessly
then
stood
for
several
moments
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
the
suspicion
gaining
ground
with
every
second
then
suddenly
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
it
had
created
ran
down
the
stairs
again
sylvia
door
was
closed
he
knocked
all
right
just
a
minute
came
the
ready
answer
a
minute
later
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
sylvia
stood
in
it
wrapped
in
a
white
satin
edged
with
soft
fur
her
dark
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
her
neck
and
arms
bare
she
drew
back
the
quick
red
color
flooding
her
cheeks
she
exclaimed
i
never
thought
of
your
coming
back
i
supposed
of
course
it
was
one
of
the
girls
i
ca
you
must
but
sylvia
was
too
much
mistress
of
herself
and
woman
of
the
world
to
remain
embarrassed
long
in
any
situation
she
recovered
herself
before
austin
did
what
has
happened
she
asked
quickly
is
any
one
ill
no
sylvia
what
were
those
papers
you
gave
me
to
burn
waste
rubbish
go
to
bed
austin
and
do
frighten
me
out
of
my
wits
again
by
coming
and
asking
me
silly
questions
what
kind
of
waste
paper
please
be
a
little
more
explicit
how
did
you
happen
to
come
back
to
ask
me
such
a
thing
what
made
you
think
of
it
i
do
know
i
just
did
tell
me
instantly
please
do
dictate
to
me
the
last
time
you
did
you
were
sorry
yes
and
you
were
sorry
that
you
did
listen
to
me
were
you
no
she
cried
i
was
not
in
the
end
if
i
had
gone
out
to
ride
that
day
you
never
would
have
gone
to
europe
and
come
back
the
man
you
have
she
turned
away
from
him
her
eyes
full
of
tears
her
voice
shaking
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
her
emotion
almost
too
excited
himself
to
notice
it
but
he
could
not
help
being
conscious
of
the
tensity
of
the
moment
he
spoke
more
gently
sylvia
do
think
me
presuming
i
do
mean
it
that
way
and
you
and
i
must
quarrel
again
but
i
believe
i
have
a
right
to
ask
what
that
document
you
gave
me
to
burn
up
was
if
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
i
have
i
can
only
beg
your
forgiveness
for
having
intruded
upon
you
and
for
my
rudeness
in
speaking
as
i
did
she
turned
again
slowly
and
faced
him
he
wondered
if
it
was
the
unshed
tears
that
made
her
eyes
so
soft
you
have
a
right
she
said
and
should
have
spoken
as
i
did
you
were
fair
and
i
was
as
usual
i
tell
you
and
will
you
promise
me
just
to
to
give
this
little
slip
of
paper
to
your
father
and
never
refer
to
the
matter
again
or
let
him
i
promise
well
then
she
went
on
hurriedly
about
a
month
ago
i
bought
the
mortgage
on
this
farm
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
thing
that
stood
in
the
way
of
your
prosperity
now
it
hung
around
your
father
neck
like
a
millstone
just
the
thought
that
he
could
feel
that
this
wonderful
old
place
was
wholly
his
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
that
he
could
leave
it
intact
for
you
and
thomas
and
your
children
after
you
when
he
died
so
i
made
up
my
mind
it
should
be
destroyed
as
my
real
christmas
present
to
you
all
the
transfer
papers
were
all
properly
made
out
and
recorded
this
little
memorandum
will
show
you
when
and
where
but
hiram
hutt
title
to
the
property
and
mine
and
all
the
correspondence
about
them
are
in
that
fireplace
that
burden
was
too
heavy
for
your
father
to
carry
thank
god
i
been
the
one
to
help
lift
it
in
the
moment
of
electrified
silence
that
followed
sylvia
misinterpreted
austin
silence
just
as
he
had
failed
to
understand
her
tears
she
came
nearer
to
him
holding
out
her
hands
please
do
be
angry
she
whispered
i
never
give
any
of
you
anything
again
if
you
do
want
me
to
i
know
you
do
want
and
you
do
need
charity
but
you
did
need
and
want
some
one
to
help
just
a
little
when
things
had
been
going
badly
with
you
for
so
long
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
never
could
go
right
again
you
lost
your
grip
because
there
did
seem
to
be
anything
to
hang
on
to
it
meant
new
courage
and
hope
and
to
me
to
be
able
to
stay
here
i
lost
my
grip
too
i
do
think
i
could
have
held
on
much
longer
to
my
even
if
i
had
had
this
respite
if
i
can
accept
all
that
from
you
ca
you
accept
the
clear
title
to
a
few
acres
from
me
austin
stand
there
looking
at
me
like
that
tell
me
i
have
presumed
too
far
what
made
you
think
i
was
angry
he
said
hoarsely
do
men
dare
to
be
angry
with
angels
sent
from
heaven
he
took
the
little
slip
of
paper
which
she
still
held
in
her
extended
hand
i
thought
you
had
done
something
like
this
that
was
why
you
made
me
burn
the
papers
myself
in
the
name
of
my
father
and
of
my
children
god
bless
you
without
taking
his
eyes
off
her
face
he
drew
a
tiny
box
from
his
pocket
sylvia
would
you
take
a
present
from
why
yes
what
it
is
really
a
present
at
all
of
course
for
it
was
bought
with
your
money
and
perhaps
you
wo
like
it
for
i
noticed
you
never
wear
any
jewelry
but
i
could
bear
to
come
home
without
a
single
thing
for
you
and
this
represents
what
you
been
to
me
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
into
her
hand
a
delicate
chain
of
gold
on
which
hung
a
tiny
star
she
turned
it
over
two
or
three
times
without
speaking
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
then
she
said
it
a
present
for
this
means
you
travelled
and
stayed
at
cheap
hotels
and
went
without
your
lunches
or
you
could
have
bought
it
you
had
only
enough
money
for
the
trip
we
originally
planned
without
those
six
weeks
in
italy
i
wear
piece
of
jewelry
and
it
will
represent
what
been
to
in
my
mind
will
you
put
it
on
yourself
she
held
it
towards
him
bending
forward
her
head
down
it
seemed
to
austin
that
her
loveliness
was
like
the
fragrance
of
a
flower
involuntarily
the
hands
which
clasped
the
little
chain
around
her
white
throat
touching
the
warm
soft
skin
fell
to
her
shoulders
and
drew
her
closer
the
swift
and
terrible
change
that
went
over
sylvia
face
sent
a
thrust
of
horror
through
him
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shrank
away
trembling
all
over
her
face
grown
ashy
white
instantly
he
realized
that
the
gesture
must
have
replied
to
her
some
ghastly
experience
in
the
past
that
perhaps
she
had
more
than
once
been
tricked
into
an
embrace
by
a
gift
that
a
man
love
had
meant
but
one
thing
to
her
and
that
she
now
thought
herself
face
to
face
with
that
thing
again
from
one
whom
she
had
helped
and
trusted
for
an
instant
the
grief
with
which
this
realization
filled
him
the
fresh
compassion
for
all
she
had
suffered
the
renewed
love
for
all
her
goodness
were
too
much
for
him
he
tried
to
speak
to
take
away
his
hands
to
leave
her
he
seemed
to
be
powerless
then
blessedly
the
realization
of
what
he
should
do
came
to
him
open
your
eyes
sylvia
he
commanded
too
startled
to
disobey
she
did
so
he
looked
into
them
for
a
full
minute
smiling
and
shook
his
head
you
did
not
understand
dear
lady
he
said
and
dropping
on
his
knees
before
her
he
took
her
hands
laid
them
against
his
cheek
for
a
minute
touched
them
with
his
lips
and
left
her
chapter
ix
uncle
mat
made
a
determined
effort
to
persuade
sylvia
to
return
to
new
york
with
him
and
though
he
was
not
successful
he
was
not
altogether
discouraged
by
her
reply
i
been
thinking
of
it
she
said
but
i
promised
gray
i
stay
here
through
the
winter
and
she
be
hurt
and
disappointed
now
if
i
did
besides
i
do
feel
quite
ready
for
new
york
myself
yet
i
realize
that
i
remained
nearly
long
enough
and
as
soon
as
the
warm
weather
comes
i
going
to
have
my
own
little
house
remodelled
and
put
in
order
and
move
there
for
the
summer
it
be
such
fun
just
like
doll
housekeeping
then
in
the
fall
i
wont
promise
but
perhaps
if
you
still
want
me
i
come
to
you
at
least
until
i
decide
what
to
do
next
come
now
for
a
visit
if
you
wo
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
not
yet
by
spring
i
afraid
i
have
to
have
some
new
clothes
had
nothing
since
i
came
here
except
a
fur
coat
which
arrived
by
parcel
post
sally
wants
to
go
away
in
the
easter
vacation
and
if
you
can
squeeze
us
both
into
your
little
perhaps
we
come
together
then
you
determined
to
have
some
sort
of
a
bodyguard
in
the
shape
of
your
new
friends
to
protect
you
from
your
old
ones
not
quite
that
i
come
alone
if
you
prefer
it
said
sylvia
quickly
no
no
my
dear
i
should
be
glad
to
have
sally
how
about
austin
too
he
could
sleep
on
the
sofa
you
know
and
that
would
make
four
of
us
to
go
about
together
which
is
always
a
pleasant
number
thomas
would
be
home
at
that
time
and
austin
could
probably
leave
more
easily
than
at
any
other
ask
him
by
all
means
i
think
he
would
be
glad
to
go
austin
was
accordingly
invited
and
accepted
with
enthusiasm
uncle
mat
found
him
in
the
barn
where
he
was
separating
cream
with
the
new
electric
separator
but
he
nodded
with
a
smile
which
showed
all
his
white
teeth
as
his
voice
could
not
be
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
machine
indeed
i
will
he
said
heartily
when
the
current
was
switched
off
again
how
unfortunate
that
easter
comes
so
late
this
year
but
that
will
give
us
all
the
longer
to
look
forward
to
it
in
i
hate
to
have
you
go
back
stevens
but
i
suppose
the
inevitable
call
of
the
siren
city
is
too
much
for
your
easily
tempted
nature
stevens
laughed
and
assented
how
that
boy
has
changed
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
back
to
the
house
he
fairly
radiates
enthusiasm
and
wholesomeness
well
i
sorry
for
him
i
wish
sylvia
would
leave
now
instead
of
in
the
spring
in
spite
of
her
promises
and
scruples
and
and
i
wish
darn
it
all
that
she
were
as
easy
to
read
as
he
is
austin
existence
just
at
that
time
seemed
even
more
than
uncle
mat
could
suspect
the
day
after
christmas
he
pondered
for
a
long
time
on
the
events
of
the
night
before
and
gave
some
very
anxious
thought
to
his
future
line
of
conduct
at
first
he
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
avoid
sylvia
altogether
and
thus
show
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
dread
from
him
for
her
sudden
fear
had
been
very
hard
to
bear
but
before
night
another
and
wiser
course
presented
itself
to
him
the
idea
of
going
on
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
that
was
in
the
least
extraordinary
and
prove
to
her
that
he
was
to
be
trusted
accordingly
assuming
a
calmness
which
he
was
very
far
from
feeling
he
stopped
at
her
door
again
before
going
upstairs
saying
cheerfully
tell
me
to
go
away
if
you
want
to
if
not
i
come
for
my
first
french
lesson
sylvia
looked
up
with
a
smile
from
the
book
she
was
reading
entrez
monsieur
she
said
gayly
apporté
votre
livre
votre
cahier
et
votre
plume
comment
va
de
votre
ami
le
chat
de
votre
mère
noir
austin
burst
out
laughing
at
her
mimicry
of
the
typical
conversation
in
a
beginner
grammar
and
she
joined
him
the
critical
moment
had
passed
he
saw
that
he
was
welcome
that
he
had
risen
and
not
fallen
in
her
regard
though
he
was
far
from
guessing
how
much
and
opening
his
book
drew
another
chair
near
the
fire
and
sat
down
beside
her
you
must
have
some
romances
as
well
as
this
dry
stuff
she
said
when
he
had
pegged
away
at
chardenal
for
over
an
hour
we
read
dumas
together
beginning
with
the
valois
romances
and
going
straight
along
in
the
proper
order
you
learn
a
lot
of
history
as
well
as
considerable
french
some
of
it
is
rather
indiscreet
but
which
of
us
do
you
think
it
is
most
likely
to
shock
he
asked
with
such
an
expression
of
that
they
both
burst
out
laughing
again
and
when
they
had
sobered
down
now
may
we
have
some
browning
please
so
sylvia
reached
for
a
volume
from
her
shelf
and
began
to
read
aloud
while
austin
smoked
she
read
extremely
well
and
she
loved
it
she
went
from
the
last
duchess
to
the
statue
and
the
bust
from
fra
filippo
lippi
to
andrea
del
sarto
and
austin
sat
before
the
fire
smoking
and
listening
until
the
little
clock
again
roused
them
to
consciousness
by
striking
twelve
this
will
never
do
he
exclaimed
jumping
up
i
must
have
regular
hours
like
any
schoolboy
what
do
you
say
to
monday
wednesday
and
friday
evenings
from
to
ten
the
other
nights
i
bend
my
energies
to
preparing
my
lessons
a
capital
idea
austin
sylvia
there
were
however
no
more
french
lessons
that
week
the
next
evening
twenty
young
people
went
off
together
in
sleighs
got
their
supper
at
white
water
danced
there
until
midnight
and
did
not
reach
home
until
three
in
the
morning
the
following
night
there
was
a
show
in
wallacetown
and
although
they
had
all
declared
at
their
respective
for
breakfast
is
served
anywhere
from
to
in
hamstead
vermont
that
nothing
would
keep
them
out
of
bed
after
supper
night
off
they
all
went
again
a
ball
followed
the
show
and
the
memory
of
the
first
proved
so
agreeable
that
another
was
undertaken
and
finally
on
new
year
eve
the
grays
themselves
gave
a
party
opening
wide
the
doors
of
the
fine
old
house
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
sylvia
played
for
the
others
to
dance
on
this
occasion
as
she
had
done
at
christmas
but
in
the
rest
of
the
she
naturally
could
take
no
part
austin
however
proved
the
most
enthusiastic
reveller
of
all
put
through
his
work
like
chain
lightning
and
was
out
and
off
before
the
plodding
thomas
had
fairly
begun
manlike
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
give
up
any
of
these
festivities
because
sylvia
could
not
join
in
them
for
years
he
had
hungered
and
thirsted
as
most
boys
do
for
a
good
time
and
done
so
in
vain
for
years
his
work
had
seemed
so
endless
and
yet
so
futile
for
what
was
it
all
leading
to
that
it
had
been
heartlessly
and
hopelessly
done
and
when
it
was
finished
it
had
left
him
so
weary
that
he
had
no
spirit
for
anything
else
much
of
the
time
now
the
old
order
had
indeed
changed
yielding
place
to
new
good
looks
good
health
and
a
good
mind
he
had
always
possessed
but
they
had
availed
him
little
as
they
have
many
another
person
until
good
courage
and
high
ideals
had
been
added
to
them
he
scarcely
saw
sylvia
for
several
days
and
did
not
even
realize
it
they
seemed
so
full
and
so
delightful
then
coming
out
of
the
house
early
one
afternoon
intending
to
go
to
the
barn
to
do
some
little
odd
jobs
of
cleaning
up
he
met
her
coming
towards
him
on
snowshoes
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
eyes
sparkling
she
waved
her
hand
and
hurried
towards
him
oh
are
you
awfully
busy
no
not
at
all
why
i
just
been
over
to
my
house
for
the
first
time
you
know
in
the
fall
i
could
walk
and
then
i
lost
the
key
and
well
one
thing
after
another
has
kept
me
away
lately
the
deep
snow
but
these
last
few
days
i
got
to
thinking
about
it
you
all
been
gone
so
much
i
been
alone
you
see
so
i
decided
to
try
getting
there
on
snowshoes
just
think
of
having
a
house
that
so
quiet
that
there
is
even
a
to
it
any
more
it
was
quite
a
tramp
but
i
made
it
and
went
in
and
oh
it
so
so
exactly
like
what
i
hoped
it
was
going
to
be
that
i
hurried
back
to
see
if
you
would
come
and
see
it
too
and
let
me
tell
you
everything
i
planning
to
do
to
it
she
stopped
entirely
out
of
breath
in
a
flash
austin
realized
first
that
she
had
been
lonely
and
neglected
in
the
midst
of
the
good
times
that
all
the
others
had
been
having
realized
too
that
he
had
never
before
seen
her
so
full
of
vitality
and
enthusiasm
and
then
that
without
being
even
conscious
of
it
she
had
come
instinctively
to
him
to
share
her
joy
while
he
had
almost
forgotten
her
in
his
he
was
not
sufficiently
versed
in
the
study
of
human
nature
to
know
that
it
has
always
been
thus
with
men
and
women
since
eve
tried
to
share
her
apple
with
adam
and
only
got
blamed
for
her
pains
austin
blamed
himself
bitterly
and
resentfully
and
decided
afresh
that
he
was
the
most
utterly
ungrateful
and
unworthy
of
men
his
reflections
made
him
slow
in
answering
do
you
to
come
of
course
i
want
to
come
i
was
just
thinking
wait
a
second
i
get
my
snowshoes
i
going
to
tear
down
a
partition
she
went
on
excitedly
as
they
ploughed
through
the
snow
together
and
have
one
big
on
the
left
of
the
front
door
on
the
right
of
it
a
big
bedroom
i
always
for
a
downstairs
bedroom
i
do
know
why
but
i
never
had
one
till
i
came
to
your
house
with
a
bathroom
and
behind
it
the
and
kitchen
will
be
in
the
ell
i
sure
i
can
make
that
unfinished
attic
into
three
more
bedrooms
and
another
bathroom
but
i
want
to
see
what
you
think
i
going
to
have
a
great
deep
piazza
all
around
it
and
a
and
she
could
hardly
wait
to
get
there
her
enthusiasm
was
contagious
austin
soon
found
himself
making
suggestions
helping
her
in
her
plans
they
went
through
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
tiny
cottage
he
had
not
dreamed
that
it
possessed
the
possibilities
that
sylvia
immediately
found
in
it
they
stayed
a
long
time
and
walked
home
over
fields
of
snow
which
the
sinking
sun
was
turning
rosy
in
its
glowing
light
that
evening
austin
came
for
his
lesson
again
by
the
second
of
january
the
last
of
the
visitors
had
gone
and
the
old
gray
place
was
restored
to
the
order
and
quiet
which
had
reigned
before
the
holidays
began
gray
was
lonely
but
her
mind
was
at
ease
she
had
been
watching
austin
closely
and
it
seemed
quite
clear
to
her
that
uncle
mat
was
mistaken
about
him
the
idea
that
her
favorite
son
was
going
to
be
made
unhappy
was
quickly
dismissed
and
in
her
rejoicing
over
the
first
payment
on
their
debt
at
the
bank
and
in
the
new
position
of
importance
and
consequence
which
her
husband
was
beginning
to
occupy
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
soon
completely
forgotten
the
succeeding
months
seemed
to
prove
her
right
and
the
interest
in
the
family
was
gray
election
to
the
presidency
of
the
cooperative
creamery
association
of
hamstead
and
his
probable
chances
of
being
nominated
as
first
selectman
in
place
of
silas
jones
recently
deceased
at
march
town
meeting
chapter
x
wallacetown
the
railroad
centre
which
lay
five
miles
south
of
hamstead
across
the
connecticut
river
was
generally
regarded
by
the
agricultural
community
in
its
vicinity
as
a
den
of
iniquity
this
opinion
was
not
deserved
wallacetown
was
progressive
and
prosperous
its
high
school
ranked
with
the
best
in
the
state
its
shops
were
excellent
its
buildings
both
public
and
private
neat
and
attractive
there
were
several
reasons
however
for
the
slams
which
its
neighbors
gave
it
its
population
instead
of
being
composed
largely
of
farmers
the
sons
grandsons
and
of
the
old
families
who
had
first
settled
the
valley
was
made
up
of
railway
employees
and
officials
and
of
merchants
who
had
come
there
at
a
later
date
close
between
them
and
the
dwellers
in
hamstead
white
water
and
other
villages
near
at
hand
would
have
worked
out
for
the
advantage
of
both
but
unfortunately
they
did
not
realize
this
wallacetown
was
also
the
only
town
in
the
vicinity
where
a
man
could
raise
a
thirst
as
austin
put
it
vermont
being
dry
and
new
hampshire
at
this
time
local
option
probably
from
the
earliest
era
young
men
have
been
thirsty
and
their
parents
have
bemoaned
the
fact
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
eve
wringing
her
hands
over
cain
and
abel
when
they
first
sampled
generously
the
beverage
they
had
made
from
the
purple
grapes
which
grew
so
plentifully
near
the
garden
of
eden
wallacetown
also
offered
balls
not
occasionally
but
two
or
three
times
a
week
the
elks
hall
the
opera
house
and
even
the
parish
house
were
constantly
being
thrown
open
and
a
local
orchestra
flourished
these
balls
were
usually
quite
as
innocent
as
those
that
took
place
in
larger
cities
under
more
elegant
and
exclusive
surroundings
but
the
stricter
methodists
and
congregationalists
of
the
countryside
did
not
believe
in
dancing
at
all
especially
when
there
might
be
a
or
a
glass
of
ale
connected
with
it
besides
there
were
two
poolrooms
and
a
wide
street
paved
with
asphalt
and
brilliantly
lighted
down
both
sides
trains
ran
and
stopped
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
sundays
as
well
as
in
short
wallacetown
was
that
alone
in
the
eyes
of
hamstead
was
enough
to
condemn
it
and
when
an
enterprising
citizen
opened
a
palace
and
promptly
made
an
enormous
success
of
it
elliott
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
it
something
scandalous
she
declared
to
see
the
boys
an
girls
who
would
be
goin
to
christian
endeavor
or
epworth
league
if
they
ben
brought
up
right
crowdin
the
entrance
doors
lookin
at
the
posters
an
payin
out
good
money
that
ought
to
go
into
the
missionary
boxes
for
the
heathen
in
the
sandwich
islands
to
go
an
see
filums
of
wimmen
without
half
enough
clothes
on
we
read
in
the
that
there
was
goin
to
be
a
picture
called
serpent
of
the
nile
joe
an
i
thought
we
could
risk
that
it
sounded
kinder
geographical
instructive
of
course
we
went
mostly
to
see
the
new
buildin
an
who
else
would
be
there
anyway
but
land
the
serpent
was
a
girl
dressed
in
the
main
in
beads
an
a
pleasant
smile
she
loafed
around
on
sofas
that
was
set
right
out
in
the
open
air
an
seemed
to
have
more
beaux
than
i
always
suspicious
of
that
kind
of
a
woman
i
wanted
to
leave
right
away
as
soon
as
i
see
what
it
was
goin
to
be
like
but
joe
would
he
wanted
to
set
right
there
until
it
was
over
he
seemed
to
feel
afraid
some
one
might
see
us
comin
out
an
that
maybe
we
better
stay
until
the
very
end
so
we
would
be
noticed
out
with
the
have
you
took
cold
sylvia
you
seem
to
have
a
real
bad
cough
sylvia
who
had
been
sewing
peacefully
beside
the
sunny
kitchen
window
filled
with
geraniums
rose
hastily
and
left
gray
alone
with
her
friend
having
gained
the
hall
in
safety
she
sank
down
on
the
stairs
and
laughed
until
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
here
austin
coming
in
a
moment
later
found
her
what
on
earth
he
began
and
then
without
even
pursuing
his
question
sat
down
beside
her
and
joined
in
her
laugh
what
would
you
do
he
said
at
last
when
some
semblance
of
order
had
been
restored
without
elliott
considering
the
quiet
life
you
lead
you
must
be
simply
pining
for
amusement
i
am
said
sylvia
austin
let
go
to
the
movies
in
wallacetown
night
austin
suddenly
grave
shook
his
head
shows
in
wallacetown
were
associated
in
his
mind
with
a
period
in
his
life
when
he
had
very
nearly
broken
his
mother
heart
and
which
he
had
now
put
definitely
behind
him
the
idea
of
connecting
sylvia
even
in
the
most
remote
way
with
that
period
was
abhorrent
to
him
why
not
she
asked
defiantly
well
for
one
thing
the
roads
are
awful
this
combination
in
march
of
melting
snow
and
mud
is
worse
than
anything
i
know
of
ruts
and
holes
and
slush
it
would
take
us
over
an
hour
to
get
there
and
three
to
get
back
i
suppose
said
sylvia
pertly
we
could
go
in
my
motor
i
have
taken
out
the
new
license
for
this
year
yet
besides
though
i
believe
the
movies
are
very
good
for
a
place
the
size
of
wallacetown
of
course
they
ca
be
equal
to
what
you
be
seeing
in
new
york
pretty
soon
wait
and
go
there
i
wo
said
sylvia
springing
up
i
get
thomas
to
take
me
you
always
have
some
excuse
when
i
want
you
to
do
anything
why
do
you
say
right
out
that
you
do
care
to
go
sylvia
expected
denials
and
protestations
she
was
disappointed
thomas
had
arrived
home
for
his
long
spring
vacation
a
few
days
before
and
had
promptly
begun
to
follow
sylvia
about
like
a
shadow
austin
who
never
sought
her
out
except
for
his
french
lessons
had
endeavored
to
remonstrate
with
his
younger
brother
the
boy
flared
up
with
such
unusual
and
unreasonable
anger
that
austin
had
decided
it
was
wiser
not
to
try
to
spare
him
any
longer
but
to
let
him
make
a
fool
of
himself
and
have
it
over
with
when
sylvia
made
her
tart
speech
it
suddenly
flashed
through
his
mind
that
a
ride
without
possibility
of
interruption
was
an
excellent
opportunity
for
this
he
therefore
grinned
so
cheerfully
that
sylvia
was
more
puzzled
and
piqued
than
ever
i
sure
thomas
would
be
tickled
to
death
to
take
you
he
said
enthusiastically
i
get
the
car
registered
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
he
can
spend
the
afternoon
washing
and
oiling
it
it
really
needs
a
pretty
thorough
it
do
my
heart
good
to
see
him
in
his
old
clothes
for
once
he
seems
to
have
entirely
overlooked
the
fact
that
he
was
to
spend
this
vacation
being
pretty
useful
on
the
farm
and
not
sighing
at
your
heels
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
as
he
understands
it
he
wearing
out
the
mat
in
front
of
the
bureau
he
stands
there
so
much
and
i
hardly
had
a
chance
for
a
shave
or
a
tub
since
he
got
here
he
locks
himself
in
the
bathroom
and
spends
hours
manicuring
his
nails
and
putting
on
his
hair
he
all
right
i
wo
if
you
say
so
but
sylvia
you
ought
to
make
a
real
spree
of
this
and
go
in
to
the
for
an
soda
after
the
show
is
that
the
usual
thing
it
the
most
usual
thing
that
i
should
recommend
to
you
of
course
there
are
others
austin
you
are
really
getting
to
be
the
limit
go
tell
thomas
i
want
him
with
pleasure
i
have
murmured
austin
had
a
chance
to
tell
him
that
so
far
he
never
been
far
enough
off
except
when
he
was
getting
ready
to
come
that
probably
what
he
doing
now
i
go
upstairs
and
see
austin
had
guessed
right
thomas
stood
in
front
of
the
mirror
shining
with
cleanliness
knotting
a
red
silk
tie
he
had
reached
that
stage
in
a
young
man
life
when
clothes
were
temporarily
of
supreme
importance
gone
was
the
shy
and
shabby
ploughboy
of
a
year
before
this
young
gentleman
was
clad
in
a
checked
suit
in
which
green
was
a
predominating
color
a
striped
shirt
and
shoes
his
hair
still
dripping
with
moisture
was
brushed
straight
back
from
his
forehead
and
the
smell
of
perfumed
soap
hung
heavy
about
him
hullo
he
said
eyeing
his
brother
intrusion
with
disfavor
how
dirty
you
are
austin
whose
khaki
and
corduroy
garments
made
him
look
more
than
ever
like
a
splendid
bronze
statue
nodded
cheerfully
i
know
but
some
one
got
to
work
we
ca
have
two
lilies
of
the
field
on
the
same
sylvia
wants
to
speak
to
you
do
you
know
why
asked
thomas
promptly
displaying
more
dispatch
i
think
she
intends
to
suggest
that
you
should
take
her
to
the
in
wallacetown
night
she
does
get
much
amusement
here
and
now
that
she
feeling
so
much
stronger
again
i
think
she
rather
craves
it
of
course
she
does
said
thomas
and
if
you
were
the
most
selfish
blind
bat
that
ever
flew
you
have
seen
that
she
got
it
long
before
this
where
is
she
it
seemed
to
the
impatient
thomas
that
the
next
evening
would
never
arrive
all
night
and
all
the
next
day
he
planned
for
it
exultantly
he
was
to
have
the
chance
which
the
ungrateful
austin
had
seen
fit
to
cast
away
he
would
show
sylvia
how
much
he
appreciated
it
through
the
long
afternoon
suddenly
grown
unseasonably
warm
he
toiled
on
the
motor
until
it
was
spick
and
span
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
end
to
end
he
was
careful
to
start
his
labors
early
enough
to
allow
a
full
hour
to
dress
before
supper
cautioned
his
mother
a
dozen
times
to
be
sure
there
was
enough
hot
water
left
in
the
boiler
for
a
deep
bath
and
laid
out
fresh
and
gorgeous
garments
on
the
bed
before
he
began
his
ablutions
he
was
amazed
to
find
when
he
came
downstairs
that
sylvia
who
had
tramped
over
to
the
brick
cottage
that
afternoon
was
still
in
the
short
muddy
skirt
and
woolly
sweater
that
she
had
worn
then
poking
around
in
the
yard
testing
the
earth
for
possibilities
of
early
gardening
the
frost
has
come
out
a
good
deal
she
said
wiping
grimy
little
hands
on
an
equally
grimy
handkerchief
i
expect
the
mud
will
be
awful
these
next
few
weeks
but
i
can
get
in
sweet
peas
and
strawberries
pretty
soon
now
we
have
to
start
right
after
supper
said
thomas
by
way
of
a
delicate
hint
he
did
not
feel
that
it
was
proper
for
him
to
suggest
to
sylvia
that
her
present
costume
was
scarcely
suitable
to
wear
if
she
were
to
accompany
him
to
a
show
start
sylvia
looked
puzzled
then
she
remembered
that
in
a
moment
of
pique
with
austin
she
had
arranged
to
go
to
wallacetown
with
thomas
as
she
thought
it
over
it
appealed
to
her
less
and
less
you
mean
to
wallacetown
i
afraid
i
forgotten
all
about
it
i
been
so
busy
i
wonder
if
we
better
try
it
the
warmth
wo
have
improved
the
roads
any
and
they
were
pretty
bad
before
thomas
felt
as
if
he
should
choke
that
she
should
treat
so
casually
the
evening
towards
which
he
had
been
counting
the
moments
for
hours
seemed
almost
unbearable
he
strove
however
to
maintain
his
dignified
composure
just
as
you
say
of
course
he
replied
with
hurt
coolness
sylvia
glanced
at
him
covertly
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
twitched
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
try
it
she
said
do
you
suppose
some
of
the
others
would
like
to
come
with
us
there
plenty
of
room
for
everybody
again
thomas
choked
this
was
the
last
thing
that
he
desired
how
was
he
to
disclose
to
sylvia
the
wonderful
secret
that
he
adored
her
with
the
whole
family
sitting
on
the
back
seat
i
do
believe
they
could
get
ready
now
he
said
they
did
know
you
expected
them
to
go
you
see
and
there
really
awfully
little
time
he
took
out
his
watch
sylvia
fled
twenty
minutes
later
she
appeared
at
the
clad
in
a
soft
black
lace
dress
slightly
low
in
the
neck
her
arms
only
partially
concealed
by
transparent
flowing
sleeves
her
waving
hair
coiled
about
her
head
like
a
crown
she
had
on
no
jewels
only
the
little
star
that
austin
had
given
her
and
the
gown
was
the
sort
of
which
two
years
before
she
would
have
considered
hardly
elaborate
enough
for
dinner
alone
in
her
own
house
to
the
grays
however
her
costume
represented
the
zenith
of
elegance
and
thomas
began
vaguely
to
feel
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
own
appearance
ought
i
to
have
put
on
my
he
asked
austin
in
a
as
sylvia
left
the
room
to
get
her
wraps
the
mere
thought
of
a
at
the
wallacetown
movies
was
comic
to
the
last
degree
but
the
merciless
austin
jumped
at
the
suggestion
why
do
you
you
wo
be
very
late
if
you
change
quickly
you
need
to
take
another
bath
will
you
i
bring
round
the
car
he
showed
himself
indeed
all
that
was
helpful
and
amiable
he
not
only
brought
around
the
car
he
went
up
and
helped
thomas
with
stubborn
studs
and
a
refractory
tie
he
stood
respectfully
aside
to
let
his
brother
wrap
sylvia
coat
around
her
and
held
open
the
door
of
the
car
have
a
good
time
he
shouted
after
them
as
they
plunged
out
of
sight
somewhat
jerkily
for
thomas
who
had
not
driven
a
great
deal
was
not
a
master
of
his
mother
looked
at
him
anxiously
i
ca
help
feelin
you
up
to
some
deviltry
austin
she
said
uneasily
though
i
do
know
just
what
is
i
kinder
nervous
about
this
plan
of
them
goin
off
to
wallacetown
i
not
said
austin
with
a
wicked
grin
and
took
out
his
french
dictionary
the
first
part
of
the
evening
however
seemed
to
indicate
that
gray
fears
were
groundless
sylvia
and
thomas
reached
the
palace
without
mishap
though
they
had
left
the
homestead
so
late
owing
to
the
latter
change
of
attire
and
the
slow
rate
at
which
the
mud
and
his
lack
of
skill
had
obliged
them
to
ride
that
the
audience
was
already
assembled
and
the
terror
of
the
plains
a
stirring
tale
of
an
imaginary
west
was
in
full
progress
before
they
were
seated
did
not
fail
to
attract
immediate
attention
and
equally
immediate
remarks
and
sylvia
who
hated
to
be
conspicuous
felt
her
cheeks
beginning
to
burn
but
more
sincerely
than
elliott
she
decided
that
it
was
better
to
wait
until
the
entertainment
was
over
than
to
attract
further
notice
by
going
out
at
once
thomas
less
sensitive
than
she
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
we
have
splendid
pictures
in
burlington
he
announced
but
this
is
good
for
a
place
of
this
size
is
it
sylvia
yes
do
talk
so
loudly
i
ca
talk
any
softer
and
have
you
hear
unless
i
put
my
head
up
closer
can
i
of
course
you
may
not
do
be
so
silly
i
did
mean
to
be
fresh
you
not
cross
are
you
sylvia
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
show
would
never
end
chagrin
and
resentment
overcame
her
what
had
possessed
her
to
come
to
this
hot
stuffy
place
with
thomas
instead
of
reading
french
in
her
peaceful
pleasant
with
austin
why
did
austin
show
more
eagerness
to
be
with
her
anyway
she
liked
to
be
with
him
ever
and
ever
so
much
see
half
so
much
of
him
as
she
wanted
to
there
was
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
it
was
perfectly
true
she
was
growing
fonder
of
him
and
more
dependent
on
him
every
day
and
every
other
man
she
had
ever
known
had
been
grateful
for
her
least
favor
while
he
her
hurt
pride
seemed
to
stifle
her
she
was
very
close
to
tears
she
was
jerked
back
to
composure
by
the
happy
voice
of
thomas
my
but
that
was
a
thriller
come
on
over
to
the
sylvia
and
have
an
cone
i
not
hungry
said
sylvia
rising
and
it
must
be
getting
awfully
late
i
rather
go
straight
home
thomas
though
disappointed
saw
no
choice
but
once
off
the
brilliantly
lighted
main
street
and
lumbering
down
the
road
towards
hamstead
he
decided
not
to
put
off
the
great
moment
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
any
longer
wondering
why
his
stomach
seemed
to
be
caving
in
so
he
tactfully
began
did
you
know
i
was
going
to
be
next
month
sylvia
he
asked
no
said
sylvia
absently
that
is
i
had
forgotten
you
seem
more
like
eighteen
to
me
this
was
a
somewhat
crushing
beginning
but
thomas
was
not
daunted
i
suppose
that
is
because
i
was
older
than
most
when
i
went
to
college
he
said
cheerfully
but
though
you
a
little
bit
older
i
nearer
your
age
than
any
of
the
others
much
nearer
than
austin
had
you
ever
thought
of
that
no
said
sylvia
again
still
more
absently
why
should
i
i
feel
about
a
thousand
well
you
about
sixteen
honest
sylvia
no
one
would
guess
you
a
day
over
that
you
so
pretty
has
any
one
ever
told
you
how
pretty
you
are
well
it
has
been
mentioned
said
sylvia
dryly
but
i
have
always
thought
that
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
was
greatly
overestimated
why
it
could
be
you
perfectly
lovely
there
is
a
girl
in
burlington
that
can
hold
a
candle
to
you
i
been
going
out
socially
a
lot
all
winter
and
i
know
i
been
to
hops
and
and
the
girls
over
there
have
made
quite
a
little
of
me
sylvia
but
i
never
there
was
a
deafening
report
thomas
cursing
inwardly
interrupted
himself
we
must
have
had
a
he
said
bringing
the
car
to
a
noisy
stop
wait
a
second
while
i
get
out
and
see
it
was
all
too
true
a
large
nail
had
passed
straight
through
one
of
the
front
tires
he
stripped
off
his
ulster
and
the
coat
of
his
and
turned
up
his
immaculate
trousers
you
have
to
get
up
for
a
minute
while
i
get
the
tools
from
under
the
seat
sylvia
i
awfully
it
pretty
dark
is
it
i
never
changed
a
tire
but
once
before
austin
always
done
that
austin
always
done
almost
everything
snapped
sylvia
then
peering
around
to
the
back
of
the
car
why
do
something
what
the
matter
now
the
lock
on
the
extra
wheel
rusted
you
see
it
has
been
undone
all
winter
i
ca
get
it
off
well
it
then
we
ca
stay
here
all
night
i
have
got
anything
to
smash
it
i
must
have
forgotten
to
put
part
of
the
tools
back
when
i
cleaned
the
car
oh
thomas
you
are
the
most
boy
about
everything
except
farming
that
i
ever
saw
let
me
see
if
i
ca
help
she
jumped
out
her
feet
clad
in
silk
stockings
and
satin
slippers
sinking
into
the
mud
as
she
did
so
together
for
fifteen
minutes
rapidly
growing
hot
and
angry
they
wrestled
with
the
refractory
lock
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
no
nearer
success
than
they
had
been
in
the
beginning
we
have
to
crawl
home
on
a
flat
tire
she
said
at
last
disgustedly
i
hope
we
get
there
for
breakfast
thomas
had
never
seen
her
temper
ruffled
before
her
imperiousness
was
always
sweet
and
it
was
heaven
to
be
dictated
to
by
her
the
fact
that
he
believed
her
to
be
comparing
him
in
her
mind
to
austin
did
not
help
matters
austin
as
he
knew
very
well
would
have
managed
some
way
to
get
that
tire
changed
for
some
time
they
rode
along
in
silence
the
mud
churning
up
on
either
side
of
the
guards
with
every
rod
that
they
advanced
at
last
realizing
that
his
precious
moments
were
slipping
rapidly
away
and
that
though
in
sylvia
present
mood
it
was
hardly
a
favorable
time
to
go
on
with
his
declaration
the
morrow
would
be
even
less
so
thomas
summoned
up
his
courage
once
more
is
your
back
tired
he
asked
it
awfully
jolty
going
over
these
ruts
i
could
steer
all
right
with
one
hand
if
you
would
let
me
put
my
other
arm
around
you
you
not
steering
any
too
well
as
it
is
remarked
sylvia
tartly
what
are
you
thinking
of
do
you
touch
me
there
now
you
done
it
thomas
certainly
had
done
it
sylvia
at
his
first
movement
had
slapped
him
in
the
face
with
no
gentle
tap
and
thomas
with
only
one
hand
on
the
wheel
and
too
amazed
to
keep
his
wits
about
him
had
allowed
the
car
to
slide
down
the
side
of
the
road
into
the
deep
muddy
gutter
straight
in
front
of
the
elliotts
house
late
as
it
was
a
light
was
snapped
on
in
the
entrance
without
delay
electricity
had
been
installed
here
before
any
other
place
in
the
village
had
been
blessed
with
it
for
the
owners
never
missed
a
chance
of
seeing
anything
and
elliott
seemed
to
sleep
with
one
eye
and
one
ear
open
she
appeared
now
in
the
doorway
dressed
in
a
long
gray
flannel
wrapper
her
hair
securely
fastened
in
metal
clasps
all
about
her
head
against
the
crimps
for
the
next
day
who
is
it
she
cried
sharply
and
what
do
you
want
of
all
persons
in
the
world
this
was
the
last
one
whom
either
sylvia
or
thomas
desired
to
see
neither
answered
nothing
dismayed
elliott
advanced
down
the
walk
her
flapped
as
she
came
come
on
joe
she
called
over
her
shoulder
to
her
less
intrepid
spouse
are
you
goin
to
leave
me
alone
to
face
these
desperate
drunkards
lurchin
around
in
the
dead
of
night
an
makin
the
road
unsafe
for
doctors
who
might
be
out
on
some
errand
of
mercy
they
the
only
people
who
would
be
abed
at
this
hour
of
the
night
you
better
get
right
to
the
telephone
an
notify
jack
weston
he
ai
much
of
a
police
officer
to
be
sure
but
i
guess
he
can
deal
with
bums
like
these
too
stewed
to
answer
me
even
then
as
she
drew
nearer
she
gave
a
shriek
that
might
well
have
been
heard
almost
as
far
off
as
wallacetown
land
of
mercy
it
sylvia
an
thomas
thomas
cowered
no
other
word
could
express
it
but
sylvia
got
out
slamming
the
door
behind
her
we
been
to
wallacetown
to
a
show
she
said
with
a
dignity
which
she
was
very
far
from
feeling
and
we
been
unfortunate
in
having
on
the
way
home
and
now
we
seem
to
be
stuck
in
the
mud
i
had
no
idea
the
roads
were
in
such
a
condition
or
of
course
i
should
have
gone
we
ca
possibly
pry
the
motor
up
in
this
darkness
so
i
think
we
may
as
well
leave
it
where
it
is
first
as
last
until
morning
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
home
come
on
thomas
i
would
ha
said
elliott
severely
that
you
would
ha
done
such
a
thing
night
too
well
it
fortunate
no
one
seen
you
but
me
an
joe
if
i
was
gossipy
like
some
it
would
be
all
over
town
in
no
time
but
you
know
i
never
open
my
lips
but
land
sakes
here
comes
a
who
can
this
be
eagerly
she
peered
out
through
the
darkness
then
she
turned
again
to
the
unfortunate
pair
it
austin
in
the
carryall
she
cried
excitedly
now
ai
that
a
piece
of
luck
you
wo
have
to
walk
home
after
all
though
what
out
for
either
at
this
hour
austin
reined
in
his
horse
because
i
knew
sylvia
and
thomas
must
have
got
into
some
difficulty
he
said
quietly
considering
the
pitch
at
which
it
had
been
uttered
it
had
not
been
hard
to
overhear
elliott
speech
pretty
bad
travelling
was
it
i
sorry
tires
too
well
that
was
hard
luck
but
we
be
home
in
no
time
now
and
of
course
the
show
was
worth
it
you
did
hurt
your
any
did
you
thomas
i
worried
a
little
about
that
you
drive
i
get
in
on
the
back
seat
with
sylvia
and
make
sure
the
robe
tucked
around
her
all
right
it
seems
to
be
coming
off
cold
again
does
it
elliott
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
conversation
languished
austin
unseen
by
the
miserable
thomas
on
the
front
seat
and
unreproved
by
the
weary
and
chilly
sylvia
tucked
the
robe
around
her
and
then
apparently
forgot
to
take
his
arm
away
moreover
he
searched
in
the
darkness
for
her
small
cold
fingers
and
gathered
them
into
his
free
hand
which
was
warm
and
big
and
strong
as
they
neared
the
house
he
spoke
to
her
the
next
time
you
want
to
go
to
show
i
guess
i
better
take
you
myself
after
all
he
whispered
you
find
a
bag
in
your
bed
and
hot
lemonade
in
the
thermos
bottle
on
the
little
table
beside
it
i
put
a
small
in
it
oh
just
a
twig
and
i
kept
the
kitchen
fire
up
the
water
in
the
tank
almost
boiling
if
you
happen
to
feel
like
a
good
tub
he
helped
her
out
and
held
open
the
front
door
for
her
gravely
then
closing
it
behind
her
he
turned
to
thomas
you
better
run
along
too
he
said
with
a
slight
drawl
i
put
the
horse
up
oh
go
to
hell
sobbed
thomas
chapter
xi
so
you
refused
weston
offer
of
three
hundred
dollars
for
frieda
yes
father
do
you
think
i
was
wrong
well
i
do
know
that
a
good
deal
of
money
austin
i
know
but
think
what
she
cost
to
import
and
the
record
she
making
i
told
him
he
might
have
two
of
the
bull
calves
at
apiece
what
did
he
say
jumped
at
the
chance
he
coming
the
calves
and
the
cash
early
morning
i
said
he
might
have
a
look
at
dorothy
too
peter
thinks
she
is
quite
up
to
our
standard
and
i
inclined
to
agree
with
him
though
i
imagine
his
opinion
is
based
partly
on
the
fact
that
she
a
jersey
if
weston
will
give
three
hundred
for
right
on
the
spot
i
think
we
better
let
her
go
did
you
do
any
other
special
business
in
wallacetown
i
took
ten
dozen
more
eggs
to
hassan
grocery
and
he
paid
me
for
the
last
two
months
thirty
dollars
pretty
good
but
we
ought
to
do
better
yet
though
of
course
we
eat
a
great
many
ourselves
how
the
tax
assessing
coming
along
i
suppose
you
been
out
all
day
too
yes
i
so
green
at
it
i
find
it
rather
hard
work
it
hard
luck
that
both
of
the
listers
should
be
sick
just
now
though
in
new
hampshire
the
selectmen
always
have
to
do
the
assessing
but
i
had
some
funny
experiences
i
found
one
woman
terribly
distressed
because
her
husband
was
at
home
waited
all
yesterday
afternoon
for
you
thinkin
you
probably
be
here
she
said
he
gone
to
white
water
i
said
see
if
we
ca
get
along
just
as
well
without
him
have
you
a
horse
but
he
over
age
he
ca
be
taxed
cows
two
heifers
they
too
young
money
on
deposit
no
there
only
the
i
suggested
you
he
years
old
there
ai
no
she
rejoined
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
they
were
taxable
for
a
single
thing
austin
laughed
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
be
at
this
father
he
asked
as
he
turned
to
go
away
all
through
april
i
afraid
i
sorry
it
makes
things
so
much
harder
for
you
on
the
farm
austin
but
it
means
three
dollars
a
day
i
so
glad
katherine
and
edith
could
go
on
the
high
school
trip
to
washington
your
mother
had
her
first
letter
this
noon
you
want
to
read
it
they
having
a
wonderful
time
i
trying
to
figure
out
whether
we
can
possibly
let
katherine
go
to
wellesley
next
year
got
her
heart
just
set
on
it
and
edith
seems
perfectly
willing
to
stay
at
home
so
we
sha
be
put
to
any
extra
expense
for
her
i
guess
when
the
time
comes
we
can
find
a
way
to
help
katherine
if
she
helps
herself
as
much
as
thomas
and
molly
are
doing
by
the
way
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
there
may
be
some
reason
for
edith
sudden
turn
towards
domesticity
why
no
what
do
you
mean
peter
peter
echoed
gray
aghast
why
the
child
is
seventeen
yet
and
he
ca
be
more
than
a
couple
of
years
older
i
know
but
such
things
do
sometimes
happen
you
do
consider
peter
a
suitable
match
for
one
of
your
sisters
went
on
the
horrified
father
why
she
oceans
above
him
any
farther
than
sylvia
is
above
thomas
you
seem
to
be
taking
that
rather
hard
for
thomas
in
spite
of
austin
warnings
and
his
chastening
experience
on
the
night
of
the
expedition
to
the
palace
had
broken
bounds
again
and
openly
declared
himself
sylvia
who
already
reproached
herself
for
her
on
that
occasion
was
very
kind
and
very
sweet
and
had
the
tact
and
wisdom
not
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
joke
but
she
was
as
definite
and
firm
in
her
no
as
she
was
considerate
in
the
way
she
put
it
thomas
was
as
usual
quite
unable
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
his
parents
were
grieving
for
him
almost
as
much
as
he
was
for
himself
although
they
had
never
expected
any
other
outcome
to
his
first
and
were
somewhat
amazed
at
his
presumption
you
never
thought
of
this
yourself
went
on
the
bewildered
parent
ignoring
austin
last
remark
feeling
that
his
children
were
treating
him
most
unfairly
by
indulging
in
so
many
affairs
of
the
heart
which
could
not
possibly
have
a
fortunate
outcome
have
noticed
a
thing
and
i
sure
your
mother
has
or
she
would
have
spoken
about
it
to
me
why
edith
hardly
out
of
her
cradle
it
would
take
a
pretty
flexible
cradle
to
hold
edith
nowadays
returned
austin
dryly
she
running
around
all
over
the
countryside
and
she
has
more
partners
at
a
dance
than
all
the
other
girls
put
together
she
as
nice
as
molly
or
half
so
interesting
as
katherine
but
she
has
a
little
way
with
her
that
well
i
do
know
just
it
is
but
i
see
the
attraction
myself
i
thought
i
tell
you
so
that
if
you
did
like
it
we
could
try
to
scrimp
a
little
harder
and
send
her
off
for
a
year
or
so
too
she
never
could
get
into
college
but
she
might
go
to
some
school
of
domestic
science
no
i
did
notice
peter
state
of
mind
myself
at
first
sylvia
said
his
father
sharply
she
did
approve
of
course
on
the
contrary
very
highly
she
says
that
the
sooner
a
girl
of
type
is
married
to
the
right
sort
of
a
man
of
course
the
better
and
i
inclined
to
think
that
she
right
then
she
pointed
out
that
peter
had
gone
doggedly
to
school
all
winter
struggling
with
a
foreign
language
and
enduring
the
gibes
he
gets
from
being
in
a
class
with
boys
much
younger
than
himself
with
very
good
grace
she
mentioned
how
faithful
and
competent
he
was
in
his
work
and
how
interested
in
it
asked
if
i
had
noticed
the
excellency
of
his
handwriting
his
accounts
and
his
manners
and
finally
she
said
that
a
boy
who
would
promise
his
mother
to
go
to
church
once
a
fortnight
at
least
and
keep
the
promise
was
doing
pretty
well
speaking
of
church
said
gray
uneasily
as
if
forced
to
agree
with
all
austin
said
yet
anxious
to
change
the
subject
jessup
is
calling
he
comes
pretty
frequently
yes
i
had
noticed
for
myself
i
do
think
sylvia
particularly
likes
it
then
i
imagine
she
can
stop
it
without
much
outside
help
said
his
father
somewhat
ruefully
well
we
must
get
to
work
and
not
sit
here
talking
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
not
that
there
so
very
much
afternoon
left
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
austin
change
my
clothes
and
then
start
burning
the
there
a
good
moon
so
i
can
finish
it
after
the
milking
done
that
means
you
be
up
until
midnight
and
you
were
out
in
the
barn
at
five
exclaimed
gray
i
do
see
where
you
get
all
your
energy
from
ambition
laughed
austin
starting
away
this
is
going
to
be
the
finest
farm
in
the
county
again
if
i
have
anything
to
do
about
it
as
he
entered
the
house
and
went
through
the
hall
he
could
hear
voices
in
sylvia
parlor
and
though
the
door
was
ajar
he
went
past
it
contrary
to
his
custom
his
father
was
right
if
she
did
not
like
the
visits
she
was
quite
competent
to
stop
them
without
outside
help
was
it
possible
it
be
that
she
like
them
he
flung
off
his
business
clothes
and
got
into
his
overalls
with
a
sort
of
savage
haste
after
all
what
difference
ought
it
to
make
to
him
whether
she
liked
them
or
not
she
was
going
away
almost
immediately
would
inevitably
marry
some
one
before
very
long
jessup
at
least
held
a
dignified
position
and
possessed
a
good
education
and
if
she
married
him
she
would
come
back
to
hamstead
they
could
see
her
once
in
a
while
having
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
these
cheering
reflections
he
started
down
the
stairs
inwardly
cursing
then
he
heard
something
which
made
him
stop
short
please
go
away
sylvia
was
saying
in
the
low
penetrating
voice
he
knew
so
well
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
did
come
any
more
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
that
and
how
can
a
clergyman
so
lose
his
sense
of
dignity
as
to
behave
like
any
common
austin
pushed
open
the
door
without
stopping
to
knock
and
walked
in
jessup
he
said
coolly
my
father
told
me
we
were
having
the
pleasure
of
a
call
from
you
i
just
going
out
to
milk
you
come
with
me
and
see
the
cattle
they
really
a
fine
sight
tied
up
ready
for
the
night
jessup
picked
up
his
hat
and
austin
held
the
door
open
for
him
to
pass
out
leaving
sylvia
standing
an
erect
scornful
little
black
figure
with
very
red
cheeks
her
angry
eyes
growing
rapidly
soft
as
she
looked
straight
past
the
minister
at
austin
the
results
of
jessup
visit
were
several
the
most
immediate
one
was
that
austin
work
was
so
delayed
by
the
interruption
it
received
that
it
was
nearly
nine
before
he
was
able
to
start
his
bonfire
thomas
joined
him
but
after
an
hour
declared
he
was
too
sleepy
to
work
another
minute
and
strolled
off
to
bed
austin
next
visitor
was
his
father
who
merely
came
to
see
how
things
were
getting
along
and
to
say
and
finally
when
he
had
settled
down
to
a
period
of
laborious
solitude
he
was
amazed
to
see
sylvia
open
and
shut
the
front
door
very
quietly
and
come
towards
him
in
the
moonlight
carrying
a
white
bundle
so
large
that
she
could
hardly
manage
it
for
heaven
sake
he
exclaimed
hurrying
to
help
her
you
ought
to
have
been
asleep
hours
ago
what
have
you
got
here
something
to
add
to
your
bonfire
she
said
savagely
and
as
he
took
the
great
package
from
her
the
white
wrapping
fell
open
showing
the
contents
to
be
inky
black
all
the
crepe
i
own
i
wo
wear
it
another
day
i
been
respectful
to
death
even
if
i
could
be
to
the
dead
and
to
convention
long
enough
i
swathed
myself
in
that
stuff
for
nearly
fifteen
months
i
wo
be
such
a
hypocrite
as
to
wear
it
another
day
and
if
thomas
and
and
jessup
and
and
everybody
are
going
to
pester
the
life
out
of
me
i
might
just
as
well
be
in
new
york
as
here
i
glad
i
going
away
no
one
else
is
going
to
pester
you
said
austin
quietly
and
they
wo
any
more
but
you
have
a
good
time
in
new
york
i
think
fine
that
you
going
he
tossed
the
bundle
into
the
very
midst
of
the
burning
pile
and
tried
to
speak
lightly
pretending
not
to
notice
the
excitement
of
her
manner
and
the
undried
tears
on
her
flushed
cheeks
i
think
you
just
right
about
that
stuff
too
will
this
mean
all
sorts
of
fluffy
pink
and
blue
things
like
what
flora
little
wears
i
should
think
you
would
look
great
in
them
no
but
it
means
lots
and
lots
of
pure
white
dresses
and
plain
black
suits
and
hats
without
any
crepe
then
in
the
fall
lavender
and
gray
and
so
on
i
see
a
gradual
improvement
wo
you
sit
down
a
few
minutes
it
a
wonderful
night
thank
you
austin
you
and
sally
will
have
to
help
me
shop
when
i
get
to
new
york
heaven
knows
what
i
can
wear
to
travel
down
in
austin
stopped
raking
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
grass
beside
her
sylvia
he
said
quickly
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
ca
go
ca
go
why
not
she
exclaimed
with
so
much
disappointment
in
her
voice
that
he
was
amazed
father
a
selectman
now
you
know
and
away
all
day
just
at
this
time
on
town
business
there
too
much
farmwork
for
thomas
and
peter
to
manage
alone
i
did
foresee
this
of
course
when
i
accepted
your
uncle
invitation
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
it
means
to
me
to
give
it
up
but
you
must
see
that
i
got
to
yes
i
see
she
said
gravely
and
sat
silently
for
some
minutes
fingering
the
frill
on
her
sleeve
then
she
went
on
uncle
mat
wants
me
to
stay
a
month
or
six
weeks
with
him
and
i
think
i
ought
to
after
deserting
him
for
so
long
when
i
come
back
my
own
little
house
will
be
ready
for
me
and
it
will
be
warm
enough
for
me
to
move
in
there
so
i
think
these
last
few
days
will
be
your
family
has
let
me
stay
a
year
the
happiest
year
of
all
my
life
and
i
know
your
mother
loves
me
almost
as
much
as
i
love
her
and
hates
to
have
me
go
but
all
families
are
better
off
by
themselves
and
in
one
way
i
think
i
stayed
too
long
already
you
mean
thomas
she
nodded
her
eyes
full
of
tears
i
ought
to
have
gone
before
it
happened
she
said
penitently
any
woman
with
a
grain
of
sense
can
usually
see
that
that
sort
of
thing
coming
and
ward
it
off
beforehand
but
i
did
think
he
was
quite
so
serious
or
expect
it
quite
so
soon
the
young
donkey
to
annoy
you
so
me
surely
you
do
think
was
thinking
of
the
money
good
lord
no
it
never
entered
his
head
neither
did
it
enter
his
head
what
an
unpardonable
piece
of
presumption
it
was
on
his
part
to
ask
you
to
marry
him
a
great
ignorant
overgrown
farmer
boy
you
are
mistaken
said
sylvia
quietly
i
do
not
love
thomas
but
if
i
did
the
answer
would
have
had
to
be
just
the
same
the
presumption
would
be
all
on
my
part
if
i
allowed
any
clean
wholesome
honest
boy
in
a
moment
of
passion
to
throw
away
his
life
on
a
woman
like
me
thomas
must
marry
a
girl
as
fresh
as
he
is
himself
not
a
woman
with
a
past
like
mine
behind
her
for
nearly
a
year
austin
had
exercised
a
good
deal
of
for
a
man
little
trained
in
that
valuable
quality
at
sylvia
speech
it
gave
way
suddenly
and
without
warning
entirely
forgetting
his
resolution
never
to
touch
her
he
leaned
forward
seizing
her
arm
and
speaking
vehemently
i
wish
you
would
get
rid
of
your
false
gloomy
thoughts
about
yourself
as
easily
as
you
have
got
rid
of
your
false
gloomy
clothing
he
said
passionately
the
mother
and
husband
who
made
your
life
what
it
was
are
both
where
they
can
never
hurt
you
again
your
character
they
never
did
touch
except
in
the
most
superficial
way
when
you
told
me
your
story
that
night
in
the
woods
you
tried
to
make
me
think
that
you
did
voluntarily
what
you
did
you
lied
to
me
i
thought
so
then
i
know
it
now
you
were
flattered
and
bullied
cajoled
and
coerced
a
girl
scarcely
older
than
my
sister
edith
whom
we
consider
a
child
whose
father
is
distressed
to
even
think
of
her
as
marriageable
it
is
time
to
stop
feeling
repentance
for
sins
you
never
committed
and
to
look
at
yourself
sanely
and
happily
if
you
must
be
introspective
at
all
no
braver
lovelier
purer
woman
ever
lived
or
one
more
obviously
intended
to
be
a
wife
and
mother
the
sooner
you
become
both
the
better
there
was
a
moment
of
tense
silence
sylvia
made
no
effort
to
draw
away
from
him
at
last
she
asked
in
a
voice
which
was
almost
pleading
in
its
quality
is
that
what
you
think
of
me
austin
dropped
his
hand
good
god
sylvia
he
said
hoarsely
do
you
know
by
this
time
what
i
think
of
you
then
you
mean
that
you
want
me
to
marry
you
no
no
no
he
cried
why
are
you
so
bound
to
misunderstand
and
misjudge
me
i
beg
you
not
to
ride
by
yourself
and
you
tell
me
i
am
i
go
for
months
without
hearing
from
you
for
fear
of
annoying
you
and
you
accuse
me
of
i
bring
you
a
gift
as
a
vassal
might
have
done
to
his
liege
lady
and
you
shrink
away
from
me
in
terror
i
try
to
show
you
what
manner
of
woman
you
really
are
and
you
believe
that
i
am
displaying
the
same
presumption
which
i
have
just
condemned
in
my
own
brother
are
you
so
warped
and
embittered
by
one
experience
a
horrible
one
but
thank
heaven
quickly
and
safely
over
with
that
you
can
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
the
best
part
of
a
decent
man
love
is
not
passion
but
reverence
his
greatest
desire
not
possession
but
protection
his
ultimate
aim
not
gratification
but
sacrifice
he
bent
over
her
she
was
sitting
quite
motionless
her
head
bowed
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
put
his
arm
around
her
do
he
said
his
voice
breaking
do
sylvia
i
been
rough
and
violent
lost
my
grip
on
myself
but
it
all
over
now
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
it
is
please
lift
your
head
up
and
tell
me
that
you
forgive
me
he
waited
until
it
seemed
as
if
his
very
reason
would
leave
him
if
she
did
not
answer
him
then
at
last
she
dropped
her
hands
and
raised
her
head
the
moon
shone
full
on
her
upturned
face
and
the
look
that
austin
saw
there
was
not
one
of
forgiveness
but
of
something
so
much
greater
that
he
caught
his
breath
before
she
moved
or
spoke
to
him
are
you
blind
she
whispered
ca
you
see
how
i
have
felt
since
christmas
night
even
if
you
could
long
before
that
do
you
know
why
i
just
could
go
away
but
i
thought
you
did
care
for
me
that
you
could
possibly
have
kept
away
from
me
so
long
if
you
did
that
you
thought
i
was
good
enough
oh
my
dear
my
dear
she
laid
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
the
next
instant
she
was
in
his
arms
his
lips
against
hers
all
the
sorrow
and
bitterness
of
their
lives
lost
forever
in
the
glory
of
their
first
kiss
chapter
xii
when
two
days
later
sylvia
and
sally
left
for
new
york
none
of
the
grays
had
been
told
much
less
had
they
suspected
what
had
happened
a
certain
new
shyness
which
austin
found
very
attractive
had
come
over
sylvia
and
she
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
their
engagement
a
secret
for
a
time
and
also
to
keep
to
her
plan
of
going
away
with
the
added
reason
that
she
now
wanted
a
chance
to
think
things
over
to
think
whether
you
really
love
me
asked
austin
gravely
have
i
convinced
you
that
i
do
need
to
think
that
over
any
more
she
said
with
a
look
and
a
blush
that
expressed
so
much
that
the
conversation
was
near
to
being
abruptly
ended
austin
controlled
himself
however
and
merely
said
i
going
down
to
our
little
cemetery
this
afternoon
to
put
it
in
good
order
for
the
spring
i
know
you
always
said
you
did
want
to
go
there
but
perhaps
you
feel
differently
now
all
the
grays
are
buried
there
and
no
one
else
and
in
spite
of
all
the
other
things
neglected
we
kept
that
as
it
should
be
kept
and
it
so
peaceful
and
pretty
always
shady
in
summer
when
it
hot
and
sheltered
in
winter
when
it
cold
i
thought
you
could
take
a
blanket
and
a
book
and
sit
and
read
while
i
worked
afterwards
we
can
walk
over
to
your
house
if
you
like
you
may
want
to
give
me
some
final
directions
about
the
work
to
be
done
there
while
you
gone
i
love
to
go
to
the
cemetery
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
with
you
said
sylvia
and
afterwards
to
house
perhaps
you
want
to
give
some
directions
yourself
the
tiny
graveyard
lay
in
the
hollow
of
one
of
the
wooded
slopes
which
broke
the
great
undulating
meadow
which
stretched
from
the
homestead
to
the
river
a
wall
made
of
the
stones
picked
up
on
the
place
around
it
a
plain
granite
shaft
erected
by
the
first
gray
in
the
centre
and
grouped
about
the
shaft
the
quaint
tablets
of
the
century
before
with
names
spelled
in
an
manner
and
with
homely
rhymes
and
trite
sayings
underneath
farther
off
the
newer
gravestones
more
ornate
and
less
appealing
the
elms
were
just
beginning
to
bud
and
the
cold
april
wind
whistled
through
them
but
the
pines
were
as
green
and
sheltering
as
always
and
sylvia
spread
her
blanket
under
one
of
them
and
worked
away
at
the
sewing
she
had
brought
instead
of
a
book
while
austin
burned
the
grass
and
dug
and
pruned
whistling
under
his
breath
all
the
time
he
stopped
once
to
call
her
attention
to
a
robin
the
first
they
had
seen
that
spring
and
finally
when
the
sacred
little
place
was
in
perfect
order
came
with
a
handful
of
trailing
arbutus
for
her
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
thought
i
remembered
seeing
some
of
this
on
the
bank
he
said
always
grown
there
will
you
take
it
for
your
des
fiançailles
sylvia
i
remember
how
surprised
we
all
were
last
year
because
you
liked
the
little
wild
flowers
best
and
went
around
searching
for
them
when
your
rooms
were
full
of
carnations
and
hothouse
roses
and
because
you
used
to
go
out
to
walk
just
to
see
the
sunsets
do
you
still
love
sunsets
too
yes
more
than
ever
in
the
fall
while
you
were
gone
i
used
to
go
down
to
the
river
nearly
every
afternoon
and
watch
the
color
spread
over
the
fields
there
something
about
a
sunset
in
the
late
autumn
that
unlike
those
at
any
other
time
of
year
have
you
ever
noticed
it
not
rosy
but
a
deep
deep
golden
yellow
spreading
over
the
dull
bare
earth
like
the
glory
from
the
diadem
of
a
saint
one
of
those
gray
fathers
of
early
italy
for
instance
i
know
what
you
mean
but
they
seem
to
me
more
like
the
glory
that
comes
into
any
dull
bare
life
said
austin
the
kind
of
glory
you
been
to
me
it
worries
me
to
hear
you
say
you
want
to
go
away
to
things
over
what
is
there
to
think
over
if
you
sure
you
care
there
are
lots
of
details
to
a
thing
of
this
sort
a
thing
of
what
sort
oh
austin
how
stupid
you
are
a
a
marriage
of
course
i
thought
all
that
was
necessary
were
two
willing
victims
a
license
and
a
parson
well
there
a
good
deal
more
to
it
than
that
besides
your
family
would
surely
guess
if
i
stayed
here
i
want
to
keep
it
just
to
ourselves
for
a
little
while
i
see
it
all
right
dear
take
all
the
time
you
want
what
would
you
tell
them
anyway
she
went
on
lightly
that
i
proposed
to
you
and
that
you
accepted
me
or
to
be
more
exact
that
you
did
accept
me
but
said
no
no
most
decidedly
and
went
on
repeating
it
with
variations
until
i
threw
myself
into
your
arms
it
was
an
awful
blow
to
my
pride
considering
that
heretofore
i
certainly
had
my
fair
share
of
attention
and
even
a
little
more
than
that
to
have
to
do
the
and
i
certainly
not
going
to
go
brag
about
it
this
time
the
conversation
really
did
get
interrupted
for
austin
would
not
for
one
instant
submit
to
such
a
garbling
of
statistics
and
took
the
quickest
means
in
his
power
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
had
the
wisdom
however
greater
perhaps
than
might
have
been
expected
not
to
oppose
any
of
her
wishes
just
then
and
it
was
sylvia
herself
who
at
the
last
minute
felt
her
heart
beginning
to
fail
her
and
called
him
to
the
farther
end
of
the
station
platform
on
the
pretext
of
consulting
him
about
some
baggage
i
do
see
how
i
can
say
in
just
an
ordinary
way
she
whispered
and
i
beginning
to
miss
you
dreadfully
already
if
i
stand
it
away
from
you
you
must
arrange
to
come
down
for
at
least
a
day
or
two
it
was
beginning
to
sprinkle
and
taking
her
umbrella
he
opened
it
and
handed
it
to
her
leaning
forward
and
kissing
her
as
soon
as
she
was
hidden
by
it
i
never
meant
to
say
an
ordinary
way
he
said
cheerfully
whatever
your
intentions
were
and
of
course
i
manage
to
come
to
town
for
a
day
or
two
if
you
find
you
really
want
me
fred
would
be
glad
to
help
me
out
for
that
long
i
sure
on
the
other
hand
if
it
a
relief
to
be
rid
of
me
for
a
while
and
new
york
looks
pretty
good
to
you
do
hurry
back
you
been
away
for
a
whole
year
remember
understand
in
spite
of
his
cheerful
words
and
manner
austin
stood
watching
the
train
go
out
with
a
heavy
heart
he
was
very
sincere
in
feeling
that
his
presumption
had
been
great
and
that
he
had
taken
advantage
of
feelings
which
mere
youth
and
loneliness
might
have
awakened
in
sylvia
and
from
which
she
would
recover
as
soon
as
she
was
with
her
own
friends
again
and
yet
he
loved
her
so
dearly
that
it
was
hard
even
though
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
best
to
let
her
go
back
to
the
world
by
whose
standards
he
felt
he
fell
short
in
every
way
if
i
lose
her
he
said
to
himself
i
must
remember
that
of
course
i
ought
to
king
cophetua
and
the
beggar
maid
makes
a
very
pretty
story
but
it
does
sound
so
well
the
other
way
around
and
then
given
me
such
a
tremendous
amount
already
if
i
never
get
any
more
i
must
be
thankful
for
that
sally
spent
a
rapturous
week
in
new
york
and
came
home
with
her
modest
trousseau
all
bought
and
glowing
accounts
of
the
good
times
she
had
had
the
very
first
thing
sylvia
did
the
morning
after
we
got
there
she
said
was
to
buy
a
new
limousine
and
hire
a
man
to
run
it
my
you
ought
to
see
it
it
lined
with
pearl
gray
and
sylvia
keeps
a
gold
vase
with
orchids
fresh
ones
every
day
in
it
she
helped
me
choose
all
my
things
and
i
never
could
have
got
half
so
much
for
my
money
or
had
half
such
pretty
things
if
she
had
and
she
began
right
off
to
get
the
most
clothes
for
herself
too
i
knew
sylvia
was
pretty
but
i
never
knew
pretty
until
i
saw
her
in
a
white
dress
we
went
to
the
theatre
almost
every
evening
and
saw
all
the
sights
besides
it
did
take
long
to
get
around
in
that
automobile
i
can
tell
you
perfect
rafts
of
people
kept
coming
to
see
her
all
the
time
telling
her
how
glad
they
were
to
see
her
back
and
teasing
her
to
do
things
with
them
i
bet
she
get
married
again
in
no
time
there
were
of
men
all
awfully
rich
and
attractive
and
apparently
just
about
her
we
went
out
twice
to
lunch
and
once
to
dinner
at
the
grandest
houses
i
ever
even
imagined
and
every
one
was
lovely
to
me
too
but
of
course
it
was
only
sylvia
they
really
cared
about
i
was
about
wild
i
got
so
excited
but
it
did
make
any
more
impression
on
sylvia
than
water
rolling
off
a
duck
back
she
did
seem
the
least
bit
different
from
when
she
was
here
helping
mother
wash
the
supper
dishes
and
teaching
austin
french
she
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
i
guess
we
did
any
of
us
realize
how
important
she
was
i
did
said
austin
you
exclaimed
his
sister
with
withering
scorn
you
never
been
even
civil
to
her
much
less
respectful
or
attentive
if
you
could
see
the
way
other
men
treat
her
i
do
want
to
said
austin
with
more
truth
than
his
sister
guessed
a
young
lovely
and
agreeable
widow
with
a
great
deal
of
money
and
no
impediments
in
the
way
of
either
parents
or
children
is
apt
to
find
life
made
extremely
pleasant
for
her
by
her
friends
and
every
one
felt
moreover
that
sylvia
had
behaved
so
very
well
for
two
months
after
her
husband
death
she
had
lived
in
the
greatest
seclusion
too
ill
too
disillusioned
and
too
shattered
in
body
and
soul
as
they
all
knew
only
too
well
to
see
even
her
dearest
friends
then
she
had
gone
to
the
country
remaining
there
quietly
for
a
year
regaining
her
health
and
spirits
and
had
now
returned
to
her
uncle
home
lightening
her
mourning
going
out
a
little
taking
up
her
old
interests
again
one
by
one
a
fitting
and
dignified
prelude
for
a
new
establishment
of
her
own
she
could
not
help
being
pleased
and
gratified
at
the
warmth
of
her
reception
and
she
found
as
austin
had
predicted
that
new
york
looked
pretty
good
to
her
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
taste
for
luxury
once
acquired
is
ever
wholly
lost
even
though
it
may
be
temporarily
cast
aside
and
sylvia
was
too
young
and
too
human
as
well
as
too
healthy
and
happy
again
not
to
enjoy
herself
very
much
indeed
for
nearly
a
month
she
found
each
day
so
full
and
so
delightful
as
it
came
that
she
had
no
time
to
be
lonely
and
no
thought
of
going
away
but
gradually
she
came
to
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
the
days
were
full
that
there
were
no
opportunities
for
resting
and
reading
and
thinking
things
over
that
the
quiet
little
dinners
and
luncheons
of
four
and
six
given
in
her
honor
were
gradually
but
surely
becoming
larger
more
formal
and
more
elaborate
that
her
circle
of
callers
was
no
longer
confined
to
her
most
intimate
friends
that
her
telephone
rang
in
and
out
of
season
that
the
city
was
growing
hot
and
dusty
and
tawdry
and
that
she
herself
was
getting
tired
and
nervous
again
and
when
she
waked
one
morning
at
eleven
after
being
up
most
of
the
night
before
her
head
aching
her
whole
being
weary
and
confused
it
needed
neither
the
insistent
and
disagreeable
memory
of
a
little
incident
of
the
previous
evening
nor
the
letter
from
austin
that
her
maid
brought
in
on
her
to
make
her
realize
that
the
tinsel
of
her
gayety
was
getting
tarnished
dearest
the
letter
ran
it
is
midnight
and
as
you
know
i
am
always
up
at
five
but
i
must
send
you
just
a
few
words
before
i
go
to
bed
for
these
last
two
days
have
been
so
full
that
it
has
seemed
to
be
impossible
to
find
a
moment
in
which
to
write
you
business
is
rushing
at
the
gray
homestead
these
days
and
everything
going
finely
the
chickens
and
ducklings
are
all
coming
along
well
about
four
hundred
of
them
and
we
had
three
beautiful
new
heifer
calves
this
week
peter
is
beside
himself
with
joy
for
they
all
holsteins
i
went
to
wallacetown
yesterday
afternoon
and
made
another
payment
on
our
note
at
the
bank
at
this
rate
have
that
halfway
behind
us
soon
i
been
over
at
your
house
every
minute
that
i
could
spare
and
succeeded
in
getting
the
last
workman
out
for
good
at
eight
this
evening
i
bribed
him
to
stay
overtime
there
are
a
few
little
odd
jobs
left
but
i
can
work
those
in
myself
in
odd
moments
there
is
no
reason
now
why
you
should
begin
to
send
furniture
any
time
you
like
i
never
would
have
believed
that
it
would
be
possible
to
get
three
such
good
bedrooms
not
to
mention
a
bathroom
and
closets
out
of
the
attic
or
that
tearing
out
partitions
and
unblocking
fireplaces
would
work
such
wonders
downstairs
it
all
just
as
you
planned
it
that
first
day
we
tramped
over
in
the
snow
to
see
it
do
you
remember
and
it
all
lovely
especially
your
bedroom
on
the
right
of
the
front
door
and
the
big
on
the
left
the
papers
you
chose
are
exactly
right
for
the
walls
and
the
white
paint
looks
so
fresh
and
clean
and
i
sure
the
piazza
is
deep
enough
to
suit
even
you
i
ploughed
and
planted
your
and
as
well
as
those
at
the
homestead
and
this
warm
early
spring
is
helping
along
the
vegetation
finely
so
i
think
things
will
soon
be
coming
up
we
decided
to
try
both
wheat
and
alfalfa
as
experiments
this
year
and
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
whether
they
turn
out
all
right
katherine
graduates
from
high
school
the
eighteenth
of
june
and
as
sally
teaching
ends
the
same
day
and
fred
patience
has
finally
given
out
with
a
bang
she
has
fixed
the
for
her
wedding
she
be
busy
with
just
one
week
to
get
ready
to
be
a
bride
after
she
stops
being
a
schoolmarm
but
of
course
we
all
turn
to
and
help
her
and
molly
will
be
home
from
the
conservatory
ten
days
before
that
you
know
how
efficient
she
is
by
the
way
has
she
written
you
the
good
news
about
her
scholarship
we
may
have
a
famous
musician
in
the
family
yet
if
some
mere
man
does
step
in
and
intervene
speaking
of
lovers
peter
is
teaching
edith
dutch
and
when
mother
remonstrated
with
her
she
flared
up
and
asked
if
it
was
any
different
from
having
you
teach
me
french
i
sometimes
believe
the
baby
is
onto
us
though
all
the
others
are
still
entirely
unsuspicious
and
keep
right
on
telling
me
i
never
half
appreciated
you
so
they
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
at
the
table
with
their
heads
rather
close
together
but
i
yet
heard
edith
conversing
fluently
in
that
useful
and
musical
foreign
language
which
she
is
supposed
to
be
acquiring
i
have
had
a
letter
from
you
in
nearly
a
week
but
i
sure
if
you
were
well
and
happy
stevens
would
let
us
know
i
glad
having
such
a
good
time
you
certainly
deserve
it
after
being
cooped
up
so
long
sorry
you
think
it
is
suitable
for
you
to
dance
yet
for
of
course
you
would
enjoy
that
a
lot
but
you
can
pretty
soon
ca
you
darling
god
bless
you
always
austin
there
was
something
in
the
quiet
restrained
tone
of
the
letter
with
its
details
of
homely
everyday
news
and
the
tidings
of
his
care
and
interest
in
her
little
house
that
touched
sylvia
far
more
than
many
pages
of
passionate
outpouring
of
loneliness
and
longing
could
have
done
she
knew
that
the
loneliness
and
longing
were
there
even
though
he
would
not
say
so
and
she
turned
from
the
great
bunch
of
american
beauties
which
had
also
come
in
with
her
with
something
akin
almost
to
disgust
as
she
thought
of
austin
tiny
bunch
of
arbutus
his
bouquet
des
fiançailles
as
he
had
called
it
the
only
thing
besides
the
little
star
that
he
had
ever
given
her
she
called
her
maid
and
announced
that
in
the
future
she
would
never
be
at
home
to
a
certain
caller
then
she
reached
for
the
telephone
beside
her
bed
and
cancelled
all
her
engagements
for
the
next
few
days
on
the
plea
of
not
feeling
well
which
was
perfectly
true
and
then
she
called
up
western
union
and
dispatched
a
long
telegram
after
which
she
indulged
in
a
comforting
and
salutary
outburst
of
tears
it
will
serve
me
quite
right
if
he
wo
come
she
sobbed
i
if
i
were
he
not
one
step
and
he
just
as
stubborn
as
i
am
i
never
was
half
good
enough
for
him
and
now
i
neglected
him
and
frittered
away
my
time
and
even
flirted
with
other
men
when
i
scratch
out
the
eyes
of
any
other
woman
if
she
dared
to
look
at
him
it
to
be
hoped
that
he
does
find
out
what
a
frivolous
silly
vain
little
fool
i
am
though
it
probably
would
be
better
for
him
in
the
end
if
he
did
sylvia
passed
a
very
unhappy
day
as
she
richly
deserved
to
do
for
the
woman
who
gives
a
man
a
new
ideal
to
live
for
and
then
carelessly
herself
falls
short
of
the
standard
she
has
set
for
him
often
does
as
great
and
incalculable
harm
as
the
woman
who
has
no
standards
at
all
uncle
mat
received
a
distinct
shock
when
he
reached
his
apartment
that
night
to
find
that
his
niece
dressed
in
a
severely
plain
black
gown
was
dining
at
home
alone
with
him
before
he
finished
his
soup
he
received
another
shock
austin
gray
is
coming
to
new
york
she
said
coolly
buttering
a
cracker
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
saying
he
will
take
a
night
train
and
get
in
early
in
the
morning
eight
i
believe
i
think
go
and
meet
him
at
the
station
are
you
willing
he
should
come
here
and
sleep
on
the
sofa
as
you
suggested
once
before
or
shall
i
take
him
to
a
hotel
bring
him
here
by
all
means
returned
her
bewildered
relative
i
like
that
boy
immensely
what
streak
of
good
luck
is
setting
him
loose
i
thought
he
was
tied
hand
and
foot
by
bucolic
occupations
apparently
he
has
found
some
means
of
escape
said
sylvia
would
you
care
to
read
aloud
to
me
this
evening
chapter
xiii
why
sylvia
my
dear
i
never
dreamed
that
you
would
come
to
meet
me
austin
was
indeed
almost
beside
himself
with
surprise
and
delight
when
as
he
left
the
train
and
walked
down
the
long
platform
in
the
grand
central
station
he
saw
sylvia
dressed
in
pure
white
serge
standing
near
the
gate
he
waved
his
hat
like
a
schoolboy
and
hurried
forward
setting
down
his
to
grip
her
hands
in
both
of
his
have
you
had
any
breakfast
she
asked
as
they
started
off
yes
indeed
an
hour
ago
then
where
would
you
like
to
go
first
i
have
the
motor
here
and
both
entirely
at
your
disposal
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
laughing
it
did
occur
to
me
that
you
come
to
the
station
and
i
fully
intended
to
go
somewhere
and
get
a
that
would
proclaim
me
as
coming
straight
from
hamstead
vermont
and
replenish
the
wardrobe
that
looked
so
inexhaustible
to
me
last
fall
before
i
presented
myself
to
you
sylvia
joined
in
his
laugh
go
ahead
i
sit
in
the
motor
and
wait
for
you
afterwards
we
go
shopping
together
to
buy
things
like
these
he
asked
eyeing
her
costume
with
approval
no
i
have
enough
clothes
now
i
was
going
to
begin
choosing
our
furniture
and
thought
you
might
be
interested
get
in
dear
this
is
ours
she
said
walking
up
to
the
limousine
which
sally
had
described
with
such
enthusiasm
and
which
now
stood
waiting
for
her
its
door
held
open
by
a
french
chauffeur
who
was
smiling
with
true
gallic
appreciation
of
his
mistress
affaire
de
coeur
and
here
she
added
after
they
were
comfortably
seated
inside
taking
a
gardenia
from
the
is
a
posy
i
got
for
you
thank
you
have
you
anything
else
he
asked
folding
his
hand
over
hers
as
she
pinned
it
on
oh
austin
you
such
a
funny
lover
why
because
you
nearly
always
ask
beforehand
why
do
you
take
what
you
a
perfect
right
to
if
you
want
it
possibly
because
i
do
feel
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
or
sure
that
i
have
any
right
at
all
he
answered
gravely
and
i
ca
believe
really
real
yet
anyway
you
see
i
only
had
two
days
with
you
the
new
way
before
you
left
and
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
when
i
should
have
any
more
and
a
good
deal
of
doubt
as
to
whether
i
deserved
any
there
was
no
reproach
in
the
words
at
all
but
so
much
genuine
humility
and
patience
that
sylvia
realized
more
keenly
than
ever
how
selfish
she
had
been
you
make
me
cry
if
you
talk
to
me
like
that
she
said
quickly
oh
austin
i
countless
things
to
say
to
you
but
first
of
all
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
never
leave
you
like
this
again
that
it
just
as
real
as
that
you
can
have
just
as
many
days
as
you
care
to
now
and
that
i
spend
them
all
showing
you
how
much
right
you
have
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
down
to
hers
oblivious
alike
of
andre
on
the
front
seat
and
all
the
passing
crowds
on
fifth
avenue
do
austin
said
after
a
moment
we
must
kiss
each
other
like
that
when
some
one
might
see
us
i
forgot
for
a
minute
that
there
any
one
else
in
the
world
besides
i
afraid
if
we
do
i
let
myself
go
more
than
i
mean
to
it
all
been
stifled
inside
me
so
long
and
be
almost
rough
and
startle
or
hurt
you
i
could
bear
to
have
that
happen
to
you
again
i
want
you
always
to
feel
safe
and
shielded
with
me
safe
i
hope
i
be
as
safe
in
heaven
as
i
am
with
you
do
you
think
i
know
what
you
been
through
this
last
year
no
i
do
he
said
passionately
i
hope
not
anyway
and
that
was
before
i
ever
touched
you
besides
it
different
now
i
sha
kiss
you
again
my
dear
except
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
like
this
are
you
going
to
wait
for
me
here
he
ended
quietly
as
the
motor
began
to
slow
down
in
front
of
the
waldorf
no
she
said
her
voice
trembling
i
going
to
church
thank
god
kneeling
for
a
good
man
love
come
for
me
there
when
you
ready
are
you
in
earnest
i
never
was
more
so
he
joined
her
at
bartholomew
an
hour
later
and
seeking
her
out
knelt
beside
her
in
the
quiet
dim
church
empty
except
for
themselves
she
felt
for
his
hand
and
gripping
it
hard
whispered
with
downcast
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
austin
i
have
a
confession
to
make
of
course
you
have
i
knew
that
from
the
moment
i
got
your
telegram
well
how
bad
is
it
he
said
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
as
light
as
possible
but
her
courage
had
apparently
failed
her
for
she
did
not
answer
so
at
last
he
went
on
you
did
miss
me
much
at
first
did
you
when
you
thought
of
me
i
seemed
a
little
not
much
of
course
but
quite
an
important
little
out
of
focus
on
the
only
horizon
that
your
own
world
sees
well
i
knew
that
was
bound
to
happen
and
that
if
you
really
cared
for
me
as
much
as
you
thought
you
did
at
the
farm
it
was
just
as
well
that
it
should
for
you
soon
find
out
how
much
your
own
horizon
had
broadened
and
beautified
do
blame
yourself
too
much
for
that
i
suppose
the
worst
confession
however
is
that
something
occurred
to
make
you
long
just
a
little
to
have
me
with
you
again
just
as
you
were
glad
to
see
me
come
into
the
room
the
last
day
our
minister
called
what
was
it
austin
how
can
you
guess
so
much
because
i
care
so
much
go
on
people
began
to
make
love
to
me
she
faltered
and
at
first
i
did
like
it
i
flirted
just
a
little
then
oh
austin
do
make
me
tell
you
i
never
imagined
he
said
grimly
that
thomas
and
jessup
were
the
only
men
who
would
ever
look
at
you
twice
i
suppose
i
got
to
expect
that
men
are
going
to
to
make
love
to
you
always
unless
i
lock
you
up
where
no
one
but
me
can
see
you
and
that
does
seem
very
practical
in
this
day
and
generation
but
i
do
see
any
reason
if
you
love
me
why
you
should
them
you
have
certainly
got
to
tell
me
sylvia
i
will
not
if
you
speak
to
me
that
way
she
flashed
back
why
should
i
you
would
tell
me
all
the
foolish
things
you
ever
did
yes
sylvia
i
will
he
said
gravely
as
far
as
i
can
without
incriminating
anybody
else
no
man
has
a
right
to
kiss
or
do
more
than
that
and
tell
in
such
a
way
as
to
betray
any
woman
no
matter
what
sort
she
is
some
of
the
things
i
done
would
be
pleasant
either
to
say
or
to
hear
for
a
man
who
is
as
hopeless
as
i
was
before
you
came
to
us
is
often
weak
enough
to
be
perilously
near
being
wicked
but
if
you
wish
to
be
told
you
have
every
right
to
and
so
have
i
a
right
to
an
answer
to
my
question
no
one
knows
better
than
i
do
that
i
not
worthy
of
you
in
any
way
but
you
must
think
i
am
or
you
would
marry
me
and
if
you
going
to
be
my
wife
you
got
to
help
me
to
keep
you
as
sacred
to
me
as
you
are
now
shall
i
tell
first
or
will
you
a
church
is
a
wonderful
place
for
a
confession
you
know
and
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
it
behind
us
you
need
tell
at
all
she
said
lifting
her
face
and
showing
as
she
did
so
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
you
as
strong
as
steel
if
all
men
were
like
you
there
would
be
anything
for
me
to
tell
either
but
they
not
the
night
before
i
telegraphed
you
an
old
friend
brought
me
home
after
a
dinner
and
theatre
party
we
had
all
had
an
awfully
gay
time
and
well
i
think
it
was
a
little
gay
this
man
wanted
to
marry
me
long
ago
and
i
think
perhaps
i
would
have
accepted
him
once
if
he
had
any
money
but
he
did
then
he
made
a
lot
since
he
began
to
pay
me
a
good
deal
of
attention
again
the
instant
i
got
back
to
new
york
and
i
was
glad
to
see
him
again
and
of
course
i
ought
to
have
told
him
about
you
right
off
but
some
way
i
did
i
always
liked
him
a
lot
and
i
enjoyed
just
having
him
round
again
i
thought
that
if
he
began
to
show
signs
of
getting
restive
i
could
tell
him
i
was
engaged
and
that
would
put
an
end
to
it
but
he
did
show
any
signs
any
signs
i
mean
the
way
men
usually
do
he
simply
suddenly
broke
loose
on
the
way
home
that
night
and
when
i
refused
him
he
said
most
dreadful
things
to
me
and
took
you
in
his
arms
by
force
and
kissed
you
in
spite
of
yourself
austin
finished
the
sentence
for
her
speaking
very
quietly
oh
austin
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
could
help
it
could
help
it
no
i
suppose
you
struggled
and
fought
and
called
him
all
kinds
of
hard
names
and
then
you
sent
for
me
expecting
me
to
go
to
him
and
do
the
same
well
i
sha
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
think
you
were
twice
as
much
to
blame
as
he
was
and
if
you
ever
let
yourself
in
for
such
an
experience
again
i
never
kiss
you
again
perfectly
certain
well
i
mean
it
just
that
i
do
know
much
about
society
but
i
know
something
about
women
there
are
women
who
are
just
plain
bad
and
women
who
are
harmless
enough
and
attractive
in
a
way
but
so
cheap
and
tawdry
that
they
never
attract
very
deeply
or
very
long
and
women
who
are
good
as
gold
but
who
have
a
particle
of
allure
i
do
know
how
else
to
put
it
emily
brown
one
of
them
then
there
are
women
like
you
who
are
fine
and
pure
and
irresistibly
lovely
as
well
who
never
do
or
say
or
even
think
anything
that
is
indelicate
but
whom
no
man
can
look
at
without
wanting
and
who
consciously
or
unconsciously
i
hope
the
latter
tempt
him
all
the
time
you
apparently
feel
free
to
play
with
fire
feeling
sure
you
wo
get
even
scorched
yourself
and
not
caring
a
rap
whether
any
one
else
gets
burnt
and
then
you
awfully
surprised
and
insulted
and
all
that
if
the
the
victim
of
the
fire
in
his
first
pain
turns
on
you
dreadful
things
to
you
i
should
think
he
would
have
poor
devil
perhaps
young
girls
do
realize
but
a
woman
over
twenty
especially
if
she
been
married
has
only
herself
to
blame
if
a
man
loses
his
head
were
you
sweet
and
tender
and
just
because
you
were
sick
and
disgusted
and
disillusioned
instead
of
because
that
was
the
real
are
you
going
to
prove
true
to
your
mother
training
after
all
now
that
you
happy
and
well
and
safe
again
if
you
have
shown
me
heaven
only
to
prove
to
me
that
it
was
a
mirage
you
might
much
better
have
left
me
in
what
i
knew
was
hell
he
left
her
so
abruptly
that
she
could
not
tell
in
which
direction
he
had
turned
nor
at
first
believe
that
he
had
really
gone
then
she
knelt
for
what
seemed
to
her
like
hours
the
knowledge
of
the
justice
of
all
he
had
said
growing
clearer
every
minute
the
grief
that
she
had
hurt
him
so
growing
more
and
more
intolerable
the
hopelessness
of
asking
his
forgiveness
seeming
greater
and
greater
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
try
to
find
him
or
to
expect
that
he
would
come
back
she
must
stay
there
until
she
could
control
her
tears
and
then
she
must
go
home
a
few
women
taking
advantage
of
the
blessed
custom
which
keeps
nearly
all
anglican
and
roman
churches
open
all
day
for
rest
meditation
and
prayer
came
in
stayed
a
few
minutes
and
left
again
at
eleven
there
was
a
short
service
the
daily
morning
prayer
sparsely
attended
sylvia
knelt
and
stood
mechanically
with
the
other
worshippers
then
suddenly
just
before
the
benediction
was
pronounced
austin
slid
into
the
seat
beside
her
and
groped
for
her
hand
neither
spoke
nor
could
have
spoken
indeed
there
seemed
no
need
of
words
between
them
a
very
great
love
is
usually
too
powerful
to
brook
the
interference
of
a
question
of
forgiveness
the
clergyman
voice
rose
clear
and
comforting
over
them
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
love
of
god
and
the
fellowship
of
the
holy
ghost
be
with
us
all
ever
more
amen
is
there
a
near
here
was
the
perfectly
commonplace
question
austin
asked
as
they
went
down
the
church
steps
together
into
the
spring
sunshine
yes
just
a
few
steps
away
why
i
want
to
buy
you
some
violets
the
biggest
bunch
i
can
get
are
you
rather
extravagant
not
at
all
the
truth
is
i
come
into
a
large
fortune
austin
what
do
you
mean
he
evaded
her
question
smiling
bought
her
an
enormous
bouquet
and
then
suggested
that
if
her
destination
was
not
too
far
away
they
should
walk
she
dismissed
the
smiling
andre
and
walked
beside
austin
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
hoping
that
he
would
explain
without
being
asked
again
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
tiffany
to
buy
furniture
i
thought
tiffany
was
a
jewelry
store
and
in
the
opposite
direction
it
is
i
going
to
the
tiffany
studios
quite
a
different
place
austin
do
tease
me
do
tell
me
what
you
mean
why
surely
you
not
marrying
me
for
my
money
good
gracious
you
plague
like
a
little
boy
please
well
a
who
lived
in
seattle
and
whom
i
have
seen
in
ten
years
has
died
and
left
me
all
her
property
how
much
mercy
sylvia
how
mercenary
you
are
enough
so
you
wo
have
to
buy
my
cigars
and
are
you
glad
of
course
but
i
wish
you
stop
fooling
and
tell
me
all
about
it
well
i
sha
if
i
did
you
make
fun
of
me
because
it
would
seem
so
small
to
you
and
i
want
to
be
just
as
lavish
and
extravagant
as
i
like
with
it
all
the
time
i
in
new
york
you
have
to
let
me
now
and
just
think
i
be
able
to
pay
my
own
expenses
when
i
take
that
trip
to
syracuse
which
you
seem
to
think
is
going
to
complete
my
agricultural
education
peter
going
with
me
and
i
imagine
we
be
a
cheerful
couple
how
are
things
going
in
that
quarter
rather
rapidly
i
imagine
i
given
father
one
warning
and
i
sha
interfere
again
bless
their
hearts
i
caught
him
kissing
her
on
the
back
stairs
the
other
night
but
i
walked
straight
on
and
pretended
not
to
see
thereby
earning
their
everlasting
gratitude
of
course
poor
babies
how
many
years
older
than
edith
are
you
never
mind
you
saucy
boy
here
we
are
have
you
any
suggestions
you
may
not
care
to
make
before
the
clerks
as
to
what
kind
of
furniture
i
shall
buy
none
at
all
i
want
to
see
for
myself
how
much
sense
you
have
in
certain
directions
and
if
i
do
like
your
selections
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
the
offending
articles
will
be
used
for
kindling
wood
do
be
careful
what
you
say
they
know
me
here
careful
what
say
i
shall
be
a
regular
wooden
image
they
think
i
your
second
cousin
from
minnesota
being
shown
the
sights
he
did
indeed
display
such
stony
indifference
and
maintain
such
an
expression
of
stolid
stupidity
that
sylvia
could
hardly
keep
her
face
straight
and
having
chosen
a
big
sofa
and
a
rug
for
her
and
her
table
she
announced
that
she
would
come
in
again
and
graciously
departed
i
have
a
good
mind
to
shake
you
she
said
as
they
went
down
the
steps
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
good
actor
we
have
to
get
up
some
dramatics
when
we
get
home
did
you
like
my
selections
very
much
as
far
as
they
went
where
are
you
going
now
i
see
that
your
grinning
frenchman
and
upholstered
palace
on
wheels
are
waiting
for
you
again
well
i
ca
walk
day
i
going
to
macy
to
buy
you
better
do
something
else
i
afraid
you
criticize
my
brooms
and
saucepans
all
right
go
alone
i
going
to
the
real
tiffany
what
for
to
squander
my
fortune
pauline
pry
i
meet
you
at
sherry
at
i
suppose
some
kindly
policeman
will
guide
my
faltering
footsteps
in
the
right
direction
and
he
closed
the
door
of
the
car
in
her
radiant
face
they
had
a
merry
lunch
an
hour
later
austin
ordering
the
meal
and
paying
for
it
with
such
evident
pleasure
that
sylvia
could
not
help
being
touched
at
his
joy
over
his
little
legacy
then
he
proposed
that
although
they
were
a
little
late
they
might
go
to
a
matinee
and
afterwards
insisted
on
walking
up
fifth
avenue
and
stopping
for
tea
at
the
plaza
i
seen
more
beautiful
cities
than
new
york
he
said
as
they
sauntered
along
much
more
slowly
than
most
of
the
hurrying
throng
paris
for
instance
fairly
alive
with
loveliness
but
i
believe
there
a
place
in
the
world
that
gives
you
the
feeling
of
that
this
does
especially
just
at
this
time
of
day
when
the
lights
are
coming
on
and
all
these
multitudes
of
people
going
home
after
their
day
work
or
pleasure
it
tremendous
lifts
you
right
off
your
feet
do
you
know
what
i
mean
they
reached
home
a
little
after
six
to
find
uncle
mat
whose
existence
they
had
completely
forgotten
waiting
for
them
with
his
eyes
glued
to
the
clock
i
was
about
to
have
the
hudson
river
dragged
for
you
two
he
said
as
austin
wrung
his
hand
and
sylvia
kissed
him
penitently
where
you
been
i
came
home
to
lunch
and
made
several
appointments
to
introduce
austin
to
some
very
influential
men
who
i
think
would
make
valuable
acquaintances
for
him
it
inexcusable
sylvia
for
you
to
monopolize
him
this
way
the
happy
culprits
exchanged
glances
and
then
sylvia
linked
her
arm
in
austin
and
got
down
on
her
knees
dragging
him
after
her
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
confess
she
said
because
you
guess
it
inside
of
five
minutes
anyway
please
do
be
very
angry
with
us
what
you
talking
about
austin
can
you
explain
has
sylvia
taken
leave
of
her
senses
i
afraid
so
sir
said
austin
with
mock
gravity
it
certainly
looks
that
way
for
about
six
weeks
ago
she
told
me
that
some
time
in
the
dim
future
of
course
she
might
possibly
be
prevailed
upon
to
marry
me
uncle
mat
declared
afterwards
that
this
last
shock
was
too
much
for
him
and
that
he
swooned
away
but
all
that
austin
and
sylvia
could
remember
was
that
after
a
moment
of
electrified
silence
he
embraced
them
both
exclaiming
bless
my
stars
i
never
for
one
moment
suspected
that
she
had
that
much
sense
chapter
xiv
are
you
two
young
idiots
going
out
again
this
evening
asked
uncle
mat
as
the
three
were
eating
their
dessert
glancing
from
sylvia
white
gown
to
austin
immaculate
no
this
is
entirely
in
each
other
honor
but
i
hope
you
are
for
i
want
to
talk
to
austin
good
gracious
what
have
you
been
doing
all
day
what
do
you
expect
to
do
you
can
go
to
your
club
and
have
five
nice
long
rubbers
of
bridge
said
sylvia
mercilessly
and
when
you
come
back
please
cough
in
the
hall
i
want
to
write
a
few
lines
to
my
mother
after
i
had
a
little
talk
with
stevens
then
i
entirely
at
your
disposal
said
austin
as
she
lighted
their
cigars
and
rose
to
leave
them
i
glad
some
one
wants
to
talk
to
me
murmured
uncle
mat
meekly
sylvia
hugged
him
and
kissed
the
top
of
his
head
you
dear
jealous
old
thing
i
got
some
telephoning
and
notes
to
attend
to
myself
come
and
knock
on
my
door
when
you
ready
austin
you
have
a
good
deal
of
courage
remarked
uncle
mat
nodding
in
sylvia
direction
as
she
went
down
the
hall
perhaps
you
think
effrontery
would
be
the
better
word
not
at
all
my
dear
boy
you
misunderstand
me
completely
sylvia
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
me
and
i
been
worrying
a
good
deal
about
her
remarriage
which
i
knew
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
more
than
satisfied
and
pleased
at
her
choice
i
relieved
thank
you
it
good
to
know
you
feel
that
way
even
if
i
deserve
it
you
do
deserve
it
in
speaking
of
courage
i
meant
that
the
poor
husband
of
a
rich
wife
always
has
a
good
deal
to
contend
with
and
aside
from
the
money
question
you
supersensitive
about
what
you
consider
your
lack
of
advantages
and
polish
though
heaven
knows
you
do
need
to
be
he
added
glancing
with
satisfaction
at
the
handsome
figure
stretched
out
before
him
i
never
saw
any
one
pick
up
the
veneer
of
good
society
so
called
as
rapidly
as
you
have
it
shows
that
real
good
breeding
was
back
of
it
all
the
time
i
guess
i
better
go
and
write
my
letter
laughed
austin
before
you
flatter
me
into
having
an
awfully
swelled
head
but
i
want
to
tell
you
first
i
not
a
pauper
any
more
i
got
twenty
thousand
dollars
of
my
own
an
old
aunt
has
died
and
left
most
of
her
will
in
my
favor
taken
capital
and
paid
off
all
our
debts
except
what
we
owe
to
sylvia
she
can
give
me
that
for
a
wedding
present
if
she
wants
to
it
queer
how
much
less
sore
i
am
about
her
money
now
that
i
got
a
little
of
my
own
there
are
one
or
two
things
that
i
want
to
buy
for
her
and
i
want
to
pay
my
own
expenses
and
peter
on
a
trip
through
western
new
york
farms
this
summer
the
rest
i
must
invest
as
well
as
i
can
to
bring
me
in
a
little
regular
income
i
sure
now
that
the
farm
and
the
family
are
perfectly
free
of
debt
that
i
can
earn
enough
to
add
quite
a
little
to
it
every
year
if
sylvia
lost
every
cent
she
had
we
could
get
married
just
the
same
and
though
she
have
to
live
simply
and
quietly
she
would
suffer
i
thought
you
would
help
me
with
investments
or
take
me
to
some
other
man
who
would
i
will
indeed
if
you
do
spend
your
time
as
sylvia
fully
intends
you
shall
making
love
to
her
this
changes
the
outlook
wonderfully
clears
the
sky
for
both
of
you
it
bad
for
a
man
to
be
wholly
dependent
on
his
wife
and
scarcely
less
bad
for
her
but
another
matter
yes
sir
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
meddling
or
underestimating
sylvia
i
wo
think
that
no
matter
what
you
say
how
long
have
you
and
she
been
in
love
with
each
other
was
it
pretty
nearly
a
case
of
sight
austin
flushed
it
certainly
was
with
me
he
said
quietly
and
have
you
quarrelled
from
the
very
beginning
too
the
boy
flush
deepened
yes
he
said
still
more
quietly
we
seemed
to
misunderstand
and
antagonize
each
other
even
then
as
austin
did
not
answer
now
tell
me
truthfully
whose
fault
is
it
the
first
time
it
was
mine
said
austin
quickly
she
made
me
clean
up
the
yard
it
needed
it
too
and
i
was
furious
and
i
was
rude
worse
than
rude
to
her
for
a
long
time
but
since
then
you
need
be
afraid
to
say
it
was
hers
remarked
sylvia
uncle
dryly
she
wants
an
absolutely
free
hand
which
is
good
for
her
to
have
she
only
now
pretty
as
a
picture
and
still
absolutely
inexperienced
about
many
things
she
ca
bear
the
thought
of
dictation
and
you
both
young
and
and
proud
and
very
much
in
love
which
makes
the
whole
thing
harder
and
not
easier
as
i
suppose
you
imagine
now
some
women
even
in
these
days
are
fit
to
live
with
until
figuratively
speaking
they
been
beaten
over
the
head
with
a
club
sylvia
not
that
kind
she
not
only
got
to
respect
her
wishes
she
got
to
to
and
i
believe
you
can
make
her
want
to
i
think
you
absolutely
just
and
unusually
decent
if
i
did
i
should
dare
say
all
this
to
you
or
let
you
have
her
at
all
if
i
could
help
it
and
besides
being
fair
you
know
how
to
express
yourself
which
some
poor
fellows
unfortunately
ca
do
absolutely
in
fact
you
perfectly
capable
of
taking
things
into
your
own
hands
every
way
and
making
a
success
of
it
and
if
you
do
before
you
married
neither
of
you
can
possibly
hope
to
be
happy
afterwards
there
one
thing
you
overlooking
stevens
which
i
should
have
had
to
tell
you
anyway
what
is
it
i
not
worthy
of
tying
up
sylvia
shoes
much
less
of
marrying
her
i
been
straight
as
a
string
since
she
came
to
the
farm
but
before
that
any
one
in
hamstead
would
tell
you
it
was
town
talk
i
ca
knowing
that
act
as
i
would
if
i
did
have
that
to
remember
it
all
very
well
to
say
that
a
man
with
all
that
absolutely
i
heard
them
say
it
dozens
of
times
but
how
can
he
be
sure
he
is
through
that
the
old
sins
wo
crop
up
again
i
love
sylvia
more
than
than
i
can
possibly
talk
about
and
i
afraid
that
i
wo
be
worthy
of
her
and
that
if
she
gave
in
absolutely
that
abuse
my
position
uncle
mat
glanced
up
quietly
from
his
cigar
there
were
tears
in
the
boy
eyes
his
voice
trembled
the
older
man
for
a
moment
felt
powerless
to
speak
before
the
penitent
sincerity
of
austin
confession
the
humility
of
his
bared
soul
as
long
as
you
feel
that
way
he
said
at
last
a
trifle
huskily
i
do
believe
there
very
much
danger
for
either
of
you
and
remember
this
lots
of
good
people
make
mistakes
but
if
they
made
of
the
right
stuff
they
do
make
the
same
mistake
but
once
and
sometimes
they
gain
more
than
they
lose
from
a
you
certainly
are
made
of
the
right
stuff
perhaps
you
will
go
through
some
experience
like
what
dreading
though
i
ca
foresee
what
form
it
will
take
meanwhile
remember
that
sylvia
been
through
an
awful
ordeal
and
be
very
gentle
with
her
though
you
take
the
reins
in
your
hands
as
you
should
do
thankful
that
she
has
such
a
bright
prospect
for
happiness
ahead
of
her
now
but
do
forget
that
you
have
a
right
to
be
happy
too
do
be
too
grateful
and
too
humble
she
done
you
some
favors
in
the
past
but
she
is
doing
you
one
now
she
never
would
have
accepted
you
if
she
had
been
head
over
heels
in
love
with
you
now
write
your
letter
and
then
go
to
her
but
i
want
you
all
the
morning
we
must
look
into
the
acquaintances
i
spoke
about
and
the
investments
you
spoke
about
meanwhile
the
best
of
luck
you
deserve
it
austin
smoked
thoughtfully
for
some
minutes
after
uncle
mat
left
him
and
finally
roused
from
his
brown
study
by
the
striking
of
a
clock
went
hurriedly
to
the
desk
and
began
his
letter
before
he
had
finished
sylvia
patience
had
quite
given
out
and
she
came
and
stood
behind
him
with
her
arm
over
his
shoulder
as
he
wrote
he
acknowledged
the
caress
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
but
went
on
writing
and
did
not
speak
until
the
letter
was
sealed
and
stamped
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
dear
now
then
what
is
it
i
been
thinking
things
over
so
i
supposed
well
what
have
you
thought
honey
first
that
i
want
you
to
have
these
i
been
going
through
my
jewelry
lately
and
have
had
uncle
mat
sell
everything
except
a
few
little
trinkets
i
had
before
i
was
married
and
the
pearls
he
gave
me
then
in
my
sorting
process
i
came
across
these
things
that
were
my
father
i
never
offered
them
to
to
any
one
before
but
i
want
you
to
wear
them
if
you
will
she
handed
him
a
little
worn
leather
box
as
she
spoke
and
on
opening
it
he
found
besides
a
few
pins
and
studs
of
no
great
value
a
handsome
watch
and
a
signet
ring
thank
you
very
much
dear
i
wear
them
with
great
pride
and
pleasure
and
this
will
be
an
exchange
of
gifts
for
i
got
something
for
you
too
that
what
my
shopping
was
this
morning
he
took
her
left
hand
in
his
slipped
off
her
wedding
ring
and
slid
another
on
her
finger
a
circle
of
beautiful
diamonds
sunk
in
a
platinum
band
delicately
chased
how
exquisite
i
never
had
such
a
lovely
ring
how
did
you
happen
to
choose
just
this
largely
because
i
thought
you
could
use
it
for
both
an
engagement
ring
now
and
a
wedding
ring
when
we
get
married
which
was
what
i
wanted
and
without
another
word
he
took
the
discarded
gold
circle
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
and
partly
he
went
on
quite
calmly
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
and
as
if
it
was
an
everyday
occurrence
to
burn
up
ladies
property
without
consulting
them
because
i
thought
it
was
beautiful
and
suitable
like
the
little
star
and
you
expect
me
to
wear
it
publicly
now
i
shall
put
it
a
little
stronger
than
that
i
shall
insist
upon
your
doing
so
she
looked
up
in
surprise
her
cheeks
flushing
at
his
tone
but
he
went
on
quietly
i
just
written
my
mother
and
asked
her
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
family
that
we
are
engaged
they
have
as
much
right
to
know
as
your
uncle
you
can
do
as
you
please
about
telling
other
people
of
course
but
you
ca
wear
another
man
ring
any
longer
and
it
seems
to
me
as
we
shall
no
longer
be
living
in
the
same
house
and
as
i
shall
be
coming
constantly
to
see
you
after
you
come
back
to
hamstead
that
it
would
be
much
more
dignified
if
i
could
do
so
openly
in
the
rôle
of
your
prospective
husband
while
as
far
as
your
friends
here
are
concerned
after
what
you
told
me
this
morning
i
think
you
must
agree
with
me
that
it
is
much
fairer
to
let
them
know
at
once
how
things
stand
with
you
and
introduce
me
to
them
i
do
want
to
use
up
these
few
precious
days
giving
parties
i
want
you
to
myself
i
know
dear
that
what
i
prefer
in
one
way
too
but
i
have
got
to
take
some
time
for
business
and
later
on
your
friends
will
feel
that
you
were
ashamed
of
me
and
be
justified
in
feeling
so
when
they
learn
that
we
are
to
be
married
and
that
you
were
not
willing
to
have
me
meet
them
when
i
was
here
sylvia
did
not
answer
but
sat
with
her
eyes
downcast
biting
her
lips
and
pulling
the
new
ring
back
and
forth
on
her
finger
that
is
of
course
unless
you
ashamed
are
you
perfectly
sure
of
your
own
mind
if
not
my
letter
is
posted
yet
and
it
is
very
easy
to
tell
your
uncle
that
you
have
found
you
were
mistaken
in
your
feelings
what
would
you
do
if
i
should
she
asked
defiantly
do
why
nothing
tell
him
the
same
thing
of
course
pack
my
and
start
back
to
hamstead
as
soon
as
i
had
met
the
men
i
came
to
see
on
business
oh
austin
how
can
you
talk
so
i
do
believe
you
really
want
me
after
all
do
you
he
asked
in
an
absolutely
expressionless
voice
and
pushing
back
his
chair
he
walked
over
to
the
window
turning
his
back
on
her
completely
she
was
beside
him
in
an
instant
promising
to
do
whatever
he
wished
and
begging
his
forgiveness
but
it
was
so
long
before
he
answered
her
or
even
looked
at
her
that
she
knew
that
for
the
second
time
that
day
she
had
wounded
him
almost
beyond
endurance
if
you
ever
say
that
to
me
again
no
power
on
earth
will
make
me
marry
you
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
not
in
the
least
threatening
but
so
decisive
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
meant
what
he
said
and
we
got
to
think
up
some
way
of
getting
along
together
without
quarrelling
all
the
time
unless
you
have
your
own
way
about
everything
whether
it
fair
that
you
should
or
not
now
tell
me
what
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
and
we
try
to
do
better
those
troublesome
details
you
mentioned
before
you
left
the
farm
perhaps
i
can
straighten
out
some
of
them
for
you
if
you
only
let
me
the
first
one
is
money
i
thought
so
it
a
rather
large
obstacle
i
admit
but
things
are
not
going
to
be
so
hard
to
adjust
in
that
quarter
as
i
feared
i
tell
you
now
about
the
little
legacy
i
mentioned
this
morning
and
he
repeated
his
conversation
with
uncle
mat
you
can
do
what
you
please
with
your
own
money
of
course
take
care
of
your
own
personal
expenses
and
run
the
house
and
give
all
the
presents
you
like
to
the
girls
but
you
ever
give
me
another
cent
unless
you
want
to
call
the
family
indebtedness
to
you
your
wedding
present
to
me
you
ca
get
everything
you
want
on
the
income
of
ten
thousand
dollars
which
is
about
all
the
capital
you
have
left
when
you
paid
all
these
first
expenses
you
mention
i
can
have
everything
i
with
that
and
what
i
earn
your
next
i
suppose
i
have
to
give
in
about
the
money
but
will
you
mind
very
much
if
we
have
a
long
engagement
i
certainly
shall
as
i
told
you
before
i
think
too
much
has
been
sacrificed
to
convention
already
it
is
that
what
then
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
and
still
have
you
believe
i
love
you
dearly
you
mean
that
for
some
reason
you
not
ready
to
marry
me
yet
and
as
she
nodded
without
speaking
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
he
asked
very
gently
why
not
sylvia
i
afraid
afraid
me
no
that
is
not
of
you
personally
but
of
marriage
itself
i
ca
bear
yet
the
thought
of
facing
passion
the
hand
that
had
been
stroking
her
hair
dropped
suddenly
and
she
felt
him
draw
away
from
her
with
something
almost
like
a
groan
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
clinging
to
him
with
all
her
strength
i
love
you
and
love
you
and
oh
ca
i
make
you
see
are
you
very
angry
with
me
austin
no
darling
i
not
angry
at
all
how
could
i
be
but
i
just
beginning
to
realize
though
i
thought
i
knew
before
what
a
perfect
hell
you
been
through
and
wondering
if
i
can
ever
make
it
up
to
you
then
this
does
seem
to
you
dreadful
to
have
me
ask
for
this
not
half
so
dreadful
as
it
would
to
have
you
look
at
me
as
you
did
on
christmas
night
he
began
stroking
her
hair
again
speaking
reassuringly
his
voice
full
of
sympathy
do
cry
dearest
it
all
right
there
nothing
to
worry
over
right
that
you
should
have
your
way
about
this
it
way
too
as
long
as
you
feel
like
this
i
hope
you
wo
long
for
i
love
you
and
want
you
and
and
need
you
so
much
and
i
waited
a
year
for
you
already
but
i
promise
never
to
force
or
even
urge
you
in
any
way
if
you
promise
me
that
when
you
ready
you
tell
me
i
will
she
sobbed
with
her
head
hidden
on
his
shoulder
then
that
settled
and
need
even
be
brought
up
again
do
cry
so
honey
is
there
anything
else
just
one
thing
more
and
in
a
way
it
the
hardest
to
say
of
any
well
tell
me
anyway
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
help
my
baby
she
said
speaking
with
great
difficulty
the
poor
little
thing
that
only
lived
two
weeks
it
buried
in
the
same
lot
with
its
father
at
greenwood
i
never
can
go
near
that
place
again
i
paid
some
one
to
take
care
of
it
and
uncle
mat
has
promised
me
to
see
that
it
done
i
think
some
day
you
and
i
will
have
a
son
more
than
one
i
hope
and
he
will
but
if
this
this
baby
could
be
taken
away
from
where
he
is
now
and
buried
in
that
little
cemetery
you
know
i
could
go
sometimes
quite
happily
and
stay
with
him
and
put
flowers
on
his
little
grave
and
later
on
there
could
be
a
stone
which
said
merely
infant
son
of
sylvia
gray
apparently
austin
forgot
what
he
had
said
that
morning
for
long
before
she
had
finished
he
took
her
in
his
arms
but
the
kisses
with
which
he
covered
her
face
and
hair
were
like
those
he
would
have
given
to
a
little
child
and
there
was
no
need
of
an
answer
this
time
for
a
long
while
she
lay
there
clinging
to
him
and
crying
until
she
was
utterly
spent
with
emotion
as
she
had
been
on
the
night
when
they
had
stayed
in
the
wood
and
at
last
just
as
she
had
done
then
she
dropped
suddenly
and
quietly
to
sleep
through
the
tears
which
still
blinded
his
own
eyes
austin
remembering
how
he
had
longed
to
kiss
her
as
he
carried
her
home
rejoicing
that
his
conscience
no
longer
needed
to
stand
like
an
iron
barrier
between
his
lips
and
hers
he
waited
until
he
was
sure
that
she
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
there
would
be
little
danger
of
waking
her
then
lifted
her
took
her
down
the
hall
to
her
room
and
laid
her
on
the
big
bed
that
the
second
time
you
been
to
sleep
in
my
arms
darling
he
whispered
bending
over
to
kiss
her
before
he
left
her
the
third
time
will
be
on
our
wedding
might
god
grant
that
is
very
far
away
chapter
xv
graduation
from
high
school
ranks
second
in
importance
only
to
a
wedding
in
rural
new
england
families
for
not
only
the
graduating
exercises
themselves
with
their
salutatory
and
valedictory
addresses
their
class
history
and
class
prophecy
their
essays
and
songs
constitute
a
great
occasion
but
there
is
also
the
excursion
of
picnic
character
the
baccalaureate
sermon
in
the
largest
church
the
prize
speaking
in
the
nearest
opera
house
and
last
but
not
least
the
graduation
ball
in
the
town
hall
the
boys
suffer
agonies
in
boots
high
stiff
collars
and
blue
serge
suits
the
girls
suffer
torments
of
jealousy
over
the
fortunate
few
whose
white
organdie
dresses
come
straight
from
boston
the
valedictorian
the
winner
at
prize
speaking
the
belle
of
the
parties
are
great
and
glorious
beings
somewhat
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
graduates
and
long
after
housework
and
farming
are
peacefully
resumed
again
the
success
of
our
class
is
a
topic
of
enduring
interest
a
wedding
brings
even
more
in
its
train
the
bride
house
where
the
marriage
service
as
well
as
the
wedding
reception
generally
takes
place
must
be
swept
and
scoured
from
attic
to
cellar
and
if
possible
painted
and
papered
as
well
must
be
set
in
order
for
visiting
members
of
the
family
and
the
bridal
feast
prepared
and
served
without
the
help
of
caterers
the
express
office
is
haunted
for
incoming
wedding
presents
and
though
the
destination
of
the
trip
generally
to
montreal
or
niagara
falls
if
the
happy
pair
can
afford
it
is
a
secret
the
trousseau
and
the
gifts
as
they
arrive
stand
in
proud
display
for
the
neighbors
to
run
in
and
admire
and
the
prospective
bride
and
groom
and
blushing
attend
divine
service
together
in
the
face
of
a
smiling
and
whispering
congregation
it
was
small
wonder
then
that
the
gray
family
with
the
prospect
of
a
graduation
and
a
wedding
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
before
it
was
thrown
into
a
ferment
of
excitement
compared
to
which
the
hilarity
of
the
christmas
holidays
was
but
a
mild
ripple
molly
had
won
a
scholarship
at
the
conservatory
and
was
beginning
to
show
some
talent
for
musical
composition
katherine
was
the
valedictorian
of
her
class
edith
had
every
dance
engaged
for
the
ball
and
though
thomas
had
not
distinguished
himself
in
any
special
way
he
had
kept
a
good
average
all
the
year
in
his
studies
and
managed
to
be
very
nearly
by
the
outside
chores
he
had
done
at
college
and
it
was
felt
that
he
too
deserved
much
credit
and
that
his
would
be
a
joyful
event
he
was
trying
out
practical
experiments
with
his
class
and
could
promise
only
to
arrive
just
in
time
but
molly
who
headed
her
letters
with
the
notes
of
the
wedding
march
and
said
that
she
was
practising
it
every
night
wrote
that
she
would
be
home
long
enough
beforehand
to
help
with
and
that
mother
get
all
worn
out
working
too
hard
with
the
sadie
and
james
were
coming
home
for
a
week
to
take
in
both
festivities
though
sadie
must
be
careful
not
to
overdo
just
now
katherine
was
entirely
absorbed
in
her
determination
to
get
over
ninety
in
every
one
of
her
final
examinations
and
and
gray
were
both
so
busy
and
so
preoccupied
that
edith
and
peter
were
left
to
pursue
the
course
of
true
love
unobserved
and
undisturbed
the
effect
which
austin
letter
to
his
mother
written
the
night
after
he
reached
new
york
produced
in
a
household
already
pitched
so
high
may
readily
be
imagined
a
thunderbolt
casually
exploding
in
their
midst
could
not
have
effected
half
such
a
shock
of
surprise
or
the
gift
of
all
the
riches
of
the
orient
so
much
joy
and
when
a
week
later
he
came
home
bringing
sylvia
with
him
a
new
sylvia
laughing
crying
blushing
as
shy
as
a
girl
surprised
at
her
first
and
gray
welcomed
the
little
lady
they
loved
so
well
as
their
daughter
those
were
great
days
for
elliott
who
as
mother
of
the
prospective
bridegroom
as
well
as
gray
most
intimate
friend
enjoyed
especial
privileges
and
as
she
was
not
averse
to
sharing
her
information
and
experiences
the
entire
village
joyfully
fell
upon
the
morsels
of
choice
gossip
with
which
she
regaled
them
i
do
believe
any
house
in
the
village
ever
held
so
many
elegant
clothes
at
once
she
declared
for
besides
all
sally
things
which
are
just
too
sweet
for
anything
there
katherine
graduation
dress
an
a
third
one
mind
to
wear
when
she
bridesmaid
most
girls
would
think
they
was
pretty
lucky
to
have
any
one
of
the
three
edith
has
a
bridesmaid
dress
just
like
hers
an
a
bright
yellow
one
for
the
ball
an
molly

is
handsomest
of
all
pale
pink
silk
draped
over
kind
of
with
an
shoes
an
silk
stockin
to
match
an
mis
gray
besides
that
satin
austin
brought
her
from
europe
has
a
lavender
brocade
did
feel
to
need
it
at
all
she
told
me
sylvia
just
insisted
two
nice
dresses
are
a
bit
too
many
for
you
to
have
says
sylvia
the
gray
one
will
be
lovely
for
church
all
summer
an
after
sally
weddin
you
can
put
away
the
lavender
for
austin
she
finished
up
blushin
like
a
rose
you
any
idea
when
that
to
be
i
could
help
askin
says
mis
gray
wish
i
had
howard
an
i
tried
to
persuade
her
to
be
married
the
same
night
as
sally
i
always
admired
a
but
she
would
hear
of
it
an
i
must
say
i
was
surprised
to
see
her
so
set
against
it
an
that
austin
did
urge
her
a
bit
either
for
they
just
set
their
eyes
by
each
other
any
one
can
see
that
an
there
ai
a
thing
to
hinder
from
gettin
married
that
i
know
of
if
they
want
to
unless
perhaps
they
think
it
too
soon
she
ended
up
kinder
the
presents
are
somethin
wonderful
elliott
related
on
another
occasion
sally
uncle
out
in
seattle
widower
of
her
that
left
austin
all
that
money
has
sent
her
a
whole
white
with
pink
roses
on
it
twelve
dozen
pieces
in
all
countin
vegetable
dishes
an
a
she
had
sixteen
ten
spoons
an
eight
bowls
but
i
dare
say
they
all
come
in
handy
one
way
or
another
an
it
makes
you
feel
good
to
have
so
many
generous
friends
austin
insisted
on
givin
her
one
of
them
cows
he
fetched
over
from
holland
an
fred
says
it
one
of
the
most
valuable
things
she
got
though
i
should
feel
as
if
any
good
bossy
raised
right
here
in
hamstead
would
probably
do
just
as
well
that
he
might
have
chosen
somethin
a
little
more
tasty
ai
men
queer
sylvia
oh
she
given
her
a
whackin
big
check
enough
so
sally
can
pay
all
her
expenses
as
she
calls
all
her
life
an
never
touch
the
principal
at
that
an
a
big
box
of
knives
an
forks
spoons
chest
of
flat
silver
she
calls
it
an
a
silver
to
match
awful
plain
pattern
they
are
but
sally
likes
yes
it
nice
of
her
but
it
ai
any
more
than
i
expected
she
got
plenty
of
money
why
should
she
spend
it
only
once
did
elliott
say
anything
unpleasant
and
the
village
knowing
her
usually
sharp
tongue
thought
she
did
remarkably
well
and
took
but
little
stock
in
this
particular
speech
i
glad
it
sally
fred
picked
out
an
not
one
of
the
other
girls
she
declared
she
years
old
now
a
good
sensible
age
pleasant
an
same
her
mother
is
an
yet
real
capable
ruth
always
was
a
silly
incompetent
little
thing
she
has
to
hire
help

of
the
time

the
youngest
that
they
see
it
peter
ai
the
only
one
she
keeps
company
with
either
if
he
was
it
would
be
so
bad
for
i
guess
he
a
good
enough
boy
though
i
ca
understand
a
mortal
word
he
says
an
them
foreigners
all
have
a
kinder
vacant
look
to
me
but
the
other
night
i
was
took
awful
sudden
with
one
of
them
horrible
attacks
of
indigestion
i
subject
to
we
had
rhubarb
pie
for
supper
an
was
just
elegant
but
i
guess
i
ate
too
much
of
it
an
the
telephone
would
work
on
account
of
the
thunderstorm
we
had
that
day
seems
like
that
there
been
a
lot
of
them
this
season
so
joe
had
to
hitch
up
an
go
for
the
doctor
as
he
went
past
the
cemetery
he
see
edith
leanin
over
the
fence
with
that
jack
weston
an
it
was
past
midnight
too
in
the
midst
of
such
general
satisfaction
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
that
at
least
one
person
should
not
be
pleased
and
that
person
as
will
be
readily
guessed
was
thomas
sylvia
thinking
the
blow
might
fall
more
bearably
from
his
brother
hand
than
from
hers
relegated
the
task
of
writing
him
to
austin
and
austin
with
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
eye
wrote
him
in
this
wise
dear
thomas
when
you
made
that
little
break
that
i
warned
you
against
this
spring
sylvia
probably
offered
to
be
a
sister
to
you
i
believe
that
is
usual
on
such
occasions
you
have
doubtless
noticed
that
she
is
exceptionally
truthful
for
a
girl
so
largely
to
keep
her
word
to
you
perhaps
she
decided
a
little
while
ago
to
marry
me
of
course
i
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
this
plan
but
you
know
she
is
also
stubborn
there
seems
to
be
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
fall
in
with
it
i
do
know
yet
when
the
execution
is
going
to
take
place
and
though
of
course
it
would
be
a
relief
in
a
way
if
i
did
i
am
not
finding
the
death
sentence
without
its
compensations
why
do
you
come
home
over
some
sunday
and
see
how
well
i
am
bearing
up
sylvia
told
me
to
ask
you
with
her
love
or
i
should
not
bother
for
i
am
naturally
a
little
loath
even
now
to
have
so
dangerous
a
rival
as
you
proved
yourself
in
your
spring
vacation
too
much
in
evidence
your
affectionate
brother
austin
have
you
taken
any
more
ladies
to
palaces
lately
needless
to
say
if
sylvia
had
seen
this
epistle
it
would
not
have
gone
but
she
did
not
austin
took
good
care
of
that
and
thomas
did
come
home
without
waiting
for
sunday
he
rushed
to
the
dean
office
and
told
him
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
family
it
is
probable
that
at
the
moment
he
felt
that
this
was
true
at
any
rate
the
dean
looking
at
the
boy
flushed
cheeks
and
heavy
eyes
did
not
doubt
it
for
an
instant
of
course
you
must
go
home
at
once
he
said
kindly
wait
a
minute
my
ford
at
the
door
i
run
you
down
to
the
station
you
can
just
catch
the
one
i
tell
one
of
the
fellows
to
express
a
to
you
this
evening
travel
on
the
central
vermont
railroad
is
safe
but
its
best
friend
can
not
maintain
that
it
is
swift
to
get
from
lake
champlain
to
the
connecticut
river
requires
several
changes
much
patient
waiting
in
small
and
uninteresting
stations
for
connections
and
the
consumption
of
considerable
time
it
was
a
little
after
seven
when
thomas
dinnerless
and
supperless
reached
hamstead
and
plodding
doggedly
up
the
road
in
a
heavy
rain
met
and
elliott
just
starting
out
in
their
buggy
for
thursday
evening
prayer
meeting
pull
up
joe
the
latter
said
excitedly
as
she
spied
the
boy
advancing
towards
them
i
do
declare
there
thomas
gray
comin
up
the
road
i
wonder
if
he
been
expelled
or
only
suspended
i
must
find
out
so
i
can
tell
the
folks
about
it
after
meetin
an
go
down
an
comfort
mary
the
first
thing
in
the
mornin
after
i
get
them
tomato
plants
set
out
i
always
thought
thomas
was
some
steadier
than
austin
but
burlington
a
gay
place
an
he
probably
got
in
with
wild
companions
up
there
do
you
suppose
it
some
cheap
little
show
girl
or
gettin
in
liquor
by
express
from
over
in
new
york
state
or
forgin
a
check
on
account
of
debts
i
know
how
boys
spend
their
time
while
they
gettin
educated
you
ca
tell
me
or
maybe
he
has
passed
some
examination
he
never
was
extra
bright
failed
everything
thomas
it
nice
to
see
you
back
but
quite
a
surprise
it
not
bein
vacation
time
or
nothin
i
suppose
everything
goin
fine
at
college
ai
it
thomas
had
never
loved
elliott
and
lately
he
had
come
as
near
hating
her
as
he
was
capable
of
hating
anybody
he
longed
inexpressibly
to
cast
a
withering
scowl
in
her
direction
and
pass
on
without
answering
but
his
inborn
civility
was
greater
than
his
aversion
he
pulled
off
his
cap
and
stopped
yes
everything
all
right
i
guess
he
said
rather
stupidly
then
a
brilliant
inspiration
struck
him
i
been
doing
so
well
in
my
studies
that
they
given
me
a
few
days
off
to
come
home
that
does
often
happen
they
made
an
exception
in
my
case
it
was
seldom
that
the
thomas
was
blessed
with
one
of
these
flights
of
fancy
for
a
minute
he
felt
almost
cheered
elliott
was
baffled
do
tell
she
exclaimed
it
must
be
a
rare
thing
i
never
hear
the
like
of
it
before
i
most
surprised
you
did
take
advantage
of
such
a
chance
to
go
down
to
boston
an
see
molly
did
feel
you
could
afford
it
i
suppose
i
guess
she
kinder
lonely
down
there
she
do
seem
to
get
acquainted
real
fast
you
think
with
all
the
people
there
in
boston
she
would
ha
had
much
trouble
but
then
molly
manner
in
her
favor
an
i
suppose
folks
in
the
city
is
real
busy
must
be
awful
hard
to
keep
house
livin
the
way
they
do
i
do
think
much
of
city
life
the
last
time
joe
an
i
went
down
on
the
excursion
we
see
the
charles
river
an
the
old
ladies
home
an
the
chamber
of
horrors
down
on
washington
street
but
we
was
real
glad
to
come
home
there
was
somethin
the
matter
with
the
lock
to
our
an
we
could
get
it
undone
all
the
time
we
was
there
but
fortunately
it
was
real
warm
weather
so
we
really
did
suffer
none
i
thought
by
this
time
molly
might
have
a
beau
but
then
molly
real
plain
if
the
looks
could
ben
divided
up
more
even
between
her
an
edith
same
the
brains
between
you
an
austin
ha
ben
a
good
thing
would
it
but
then
you
say
you
gettin
on
well
now
an
in
time
some
man
may
marry
her
he
can
set
an
listen
to
her
play
when
he
comes
in
tired
from
his
chores
at
night
i
heard
of
sech
things
an
then
there
quite
a
bunch
of
in
the
family
already
ai
there
yes
said
thomas
angrily
there
is
elliott
was
quick
to
mark
his
tone
she
nudged
her
husband
well
well
she
said
playfully
austin
cut
you
out
ai
he
jessup
was
in
the
race
for
a
while
too
an
i
thought
he
was
pretty
good
but
you
know
we
read
in
the
bible
it
do
always
go
to
the
swift
an
austin
may
not
get
her
after
all
i
hear
there
several
in
new
york
as
well
an
she
might
change
her
mind
i
never
set
much
stock
in
young
men
marryin
widows
myself
seems
like
there
plenty
of
nice
girls
as
ought
to
have
a
chance
an
sylvia
awful
an
stubborn
as
a
mule
i
dunno
she
an
austin
will
be
able
to
stick
it
out
he
some
set
himself
i
should
wonder
if
it
all
got
broke
off
an
i
not
sayin
it
might
be
for
the
best
if
it
was
but
i
do
deny
real
pretty
an
generous
an
i
like
her
spunk
i
was
tellin
joe
only
yesterday
i
afraid
i
keeping
you
from
meeting
said
thomas
desperately
and
strode
off
down
the
road
the
barn
the
beautiful
new
barn
that
sylvia
had
made
possible
and
that
had
filled
his
heart
with
such
joy
and
pride
was
still
lighted
he
walked
straight
to
it
and
met
peter
coming
out
of
the
door
peter
stared
his
surprise
where
my
brother
asked
thomas
roughly
gray
ben
still
in
the
barn
vorking
it
too
bad
he
haf
so
much
to
do
he
do
get
much
time
mit
de
missus
den
she
tink
he
do
vant
to
come
i
glad
you

vas
yust
gon
in
to
get
ve
herd
book
for
him
i
took
it
in
to
show
edit
someting
i
vant
to
explain
to
her
and
left
it
in
ve
house
most
dum
you
need
bring
it
back
i
want
to
see
him
alone
peter
nodded
his
bewilderment
growing
and
disappeared
thomas
flung
himself
down
the
long
stable
without
once
glancing
at
the
row
of
beautiful
cows
his
footsteps
echoing
on
the
concrete
to
the
office
at
the
farther
end
the
door
was
open
and
austin
sat
at
the
desk
which
was
littered
with
account
books
transfer
sheets
and
pedigree
cards
typewriting
vigorously
he
sprang
up
in
surprise
why
thomas
he
exclaimed
cordially
where
did
you
drop
from
awfully
glad
to
see
you
you
damned
mean
deceitful
skunk
cried
the
boy
slamming
the
door
behind
him
and
ignoring
his
brother
outstretched
hand
i
like
to
smash
every
bone
in
your
body
until
there
was
a
piece
as
big
as
a
toothpick
left
of
you
you
made
me
think
you
did
care
a
rap
about
her
you
said
i
was
worthy
of
her
that
i
was
an
ignorant
farmer
and
she
was
a
great
lady
that
true
enough
but
i
just
as
good
as
you
are
every
bit
i
know
you
done
all
sorts
of
rotten
things
i
never
have
but
just
the
same
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
thought
that
you
or
any
gray
was
and
then
you
write
me
a
letter
about
her
like
that
as
if
she
flung
herself
at
your
head
austin
conscience
smote
him
he
had
never
seen
thomas
side
before
and
neither
he
nor
any
other
member
of
the
family
had
guessed
how
much
their
incessant
teasing
had
hurt
or
how
hard
the
younger
brother
had
been
hit
in
the
extremely
unsentimental
way
common
in
new
england
these
two
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
he
realized
that
affection
which
was
very
precious
to
him
would
be
gone
forever
if
he
did
not
set
him
right
at
once
look
here
he
said
forcing
thomas
into
the
swivel
chair
and
seating
himself
on
the
desk
ignoring
the
papers
that
fell
fluttering
to
the
floor
you
listen
to
me
you
got
everything
crooked
and
it
my
fault
and
i
darned
sorry
i
never
told
you
i
cared
for
sylvia
not
because
i
wanted
to
deceive
you
but
because
i
cared
so
everlasting
from
the
first
moment
i
set
eyes
on
her
that
i
could
talk
about
it
no
one
else
guessed
either
you
were
the
only
one
the
funny
part
of
it
is
that
did
she
thought
because
i
steered
pretty
clear
of
her
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
that
i
did
like
her
especially
imagine
not
liking
sylvia
ever
hear
of
any
one
who
like
roses
thomas
but
i
never
dreamed
that
she
have
me
or
even
of
asking
her
to
as
to
throwing
herself
at
my
head
well
she
put
it
that
way
herself
once
and
i
shut
her
up
pretty
quick
you
find
out
how
to
do
it
yourself
some
day
with
some
other
girl
though
of
course
it
does
look
that
way
to
you
now
but
i
ca
give
you
that
treatment
i
guess
i
have
to
tell
you
though
i
never
expected
to
tell
a
living
soul
just
how
it
did
happen
it
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
too
sacred
to
share
with
any
one
even
any
one
that
i
think
as
much
of
as
i
do
of
you
but
i
got
to
make
you
believe
that
five
minutes
beforehand
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
to
occur
and
as
briefly
and
honestly
as
he
could
he
told
thomas
how
sylvia
had
come
to
him
while
he
was
making
his
bonfire
and
what
had
taken
place
afterwards
then
with
still
greater
feeling
in
his
voice
he
went
on
there
something
else
i
have
told
any
one
else
either
and
that
is
that
i
ca
for
a
single
instant
get
away
from
the
thought
that
even
now
i
not
going
to
get
her
i
know
i
have
any
right
to
her
and
i
do
feel
sure
that
i
can
make
her
happy
that
she
can
respect
me
as
much
as
a
girl
ought
to
respect
the
man
she
going
to
marry
i
certainly
do
think
i
any
worthier
of
her
than
you
or
as
worthy
never
did
for
a
minute
i
done
lots
of
rotten
things
and
you
always
been
as
straight
as
a
string
and
better
thank
the
lord
you
have
when
you
get
engaged
you
wo
have
to
go
through
what
i
have
but
you
see
the
difference
is
as
far
as
sylvia
and
you
and
i
are
concerned
he
hesitated
his
throat
growing
rough
his
ready
eloquence
checked
sylvia
likes
you
ever
so
much
she
thinks
you
a
fine
boy
and
that
by
and
by
you
want
to
marry
a
fine
girl
but
i
a
man
already
and
young
as
she
is
sylvia
a
woman
and
god
knows
why
she
loves
me
austin
glanced
at
thomas
the
anger
was
dying
out
of
the
boy
face
and
unashamed
tears
were
standing
in
his
eyes
a
lot
added
austin
huskily
then
after
a
long
pause
wo
you
have
a
with
me
i
got
some
in
the
cupboard
here
for
emergencies
while
we
talk
over
some
of
this
business
i
was
deep
in
when
you
came
in
there
are
any
number
of
things
i
been
anxious
to
get
your
opinion
on
you
got
lots
of
practical
ability
and
good
judgment
in
places
where
i
weak
and
i
miss
you
no
end
when
you
where
i
get
at
you
i
certainly
shall
be
glad
when
you
through
your
course
and
home
for
good
and
after
we
get
this
mess
straightened
out
he
bent
over
to
pick
up
the
scattered
sheets
we
better
go
in
together
and
find
sylvia
had
we
chapter
xvi
strangely
enough
sylvia
and
austin
were
perhaps
less
happy
at
this
time
than
any
of
the
other
dwellers
at
the
homestead
after
the
first
day
the
week
in
new
york
had
been
a
period
of
great
happiness
to
both
of
them
and
austin
had
proved
such
an
immediate
success
both
among
friends
and
uncle
mat
business
associates
that
both
were
immensely
gratified
but
after
the
return
to
the
country
matters
seemed
to
go
less
and
less
well
during
the
year
in
which
they
had
loved
and
longed
in
secret
each
had
exalted
the
other
to
the
position
of
a
martyr
and
a
saint
the
intimacy
of
their
engagement
was
rapidly
revealing
the
fact
that
after
all
they
were
merely
ordinary
human
beings
and
the
discovery
was
something
of
a
shock
to
both
austin
had
thought
over
uncle
mat
advice
and
found
it
good
he
was
gentle
and
considerate
and
showed
himself
perfectly
willing
to
submit
to
sylvia
wishes
in
most
important
decisions
but
he
refused
to
be
dictated
to
in
little
things
she
was
so
accustomed
by
this
time
to
having
her
slightest
whim
not
only
respected
but
admired
by
all
the
adoring
gray
family
and
most
of
her
world
at
large
besides
that
she
was
apt
to
behave
like
a
spoiled
child
when
austin
thwarted
her
she
nearly
always
had
to
admit
afterwards
that
he
had
been
right
and
this
did
not
make
it
any
easier
for
her
his
incessant
obstinacy
as
she
called
it
was
rapidly
getting
on
her
nerves
while
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
could
never
meet
that
she
did
not
have
some
fresh
grievance
or
disagree
with
him
radically
about
something
she
wanted
him
at
her
side
all
the
time
he
had
a
thousand
other
interests
she
saw
no
reason
why
after
they
were
married
they
should
live
in
the
country
all
the
year
and
every
year
he
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
do
anything
else
and
so
it
went
with
every
subject
that
arose
if
sylvia
had
been
less
idle
she
would
have
had
no
time
to
think
about
nerves
but
the
manservant
and
his
wife
whom
she
had
installed
in
the
little
brick
house
were
and
competent
to
the
last
degree
and
the
ménage
ran
like
without
any
help
from
her
she
was
debarred
from
riding
or
driving
alone
and
the
girls
at
the
farm
had
no
time
to
go
with
her
and
it
was
still
an
almost
thing
in
that
locality
for
a
woman
to
run
a
motor
she
could
not
fill
an
hour
a
day
working
in
her
little
garden
and
she
had
no
special
taste
for
sewing
the
only
thing
for
her
to
do
seemed
to
be
to
sit
around
and
wait
for
austin
to
appear
and
austin
was
not
only
very
busy
but
extremely
absorbed
in
his
work
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
come
to
see
her
every
night
and
when
he
did
come
he
was
so
thoroughly
and
wholesomely
tired
and
sleepy
that
his
visits
were
short
on
sundays
he
had
more
leisure
but
and
gray
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
sylvia
would
still
go
to
church
with
them
in
the
morning
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
at
their
house
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
disappointing
them
though
she
rebelled
inwardly
but
she
complained
to
austin
as
they
were
walking
back
to
her
house
together
after
a
day
spent
in
this
manner
that
she
never
saw
him
alone
at
all
it
not
only
the
family
she
said
but
peter
and
fred
and
and
elliott
are
around
all
the
time
and
there
were
ruth
and
frank
and
those
two
fussy
babies
needing
something
done
for
them
every
single
minute
besides
it
was
perfect
bedlam
i
want
you
to
myself
once
in
a
while
you
can
have
me
to
yourself
for
good
and
all
whenever
you
want
me
replied
austin
this
was
so
undeniable
a
statement
that
sylvia
changed
the
subject
abruptly
there
is
no
earthly
need
of
your
working
so
hard
and
you
know
it
but
sylvia
i
like
to
work
and
i
awfully
anxious
to
make
a
success
of
things
now
that
we
got
such
a
wonderful
start
at
last
are
you
more
interested
in
this
stupid
old
farm
than
you
are
in
me
why
sylvia
it
is
a
old
farm
to
me
it
the
place
my
built
and
that
all
the
grays
have
lived
in
and
loved
for
four
generations
i
thought
you
liked
it
too
i
do
but
i
jealous
of
it
you
ought
not
to
be
you
know
that
there
nothing
in
the
world
so
dear
to
me
as
you
are
then
let
me
pay
for
another
hired
man
so
that
you
have
more
time
for
yourself
and
for
me
indeed
i
will
not
you
never
pay
for
another
thing
on
this
farm
if
i
can
help
it
no
one
could
be
more
grateful
than
i
am
for
all
you
done
but
the
time
is
over
for
that
wo
you
come
in
she
asked
as
they
reached
her
garden
and
she
noticed
that
he
stopped
at
the
gate
not
we
had
a
good
walk
together
and
you
know
i
have
to
get
up
pretty
early
in
the
morning
dear
and
he
raised
her
fingers
to
his
lips
she
snatched
them
away
lifting
her
lovely
face
oh
austin
she
cried
how
can
you
be
so
calm
and
cold
i
think
sometimes
you
made
of
stone
if
you
must
go
do
say
like
that
act
as
if
you
were
made
of
flesh
and
blood
i
acting
in
the
only
sane
way
for
both
of
us
if
you
do
like
it
i
had
better
not
come
at
all
and
he
went
home
without
giving
her
even
the
caress
he
had
originally
intended
and
slept
soundly
and
well
all
night
but
sylvia
tossed
about
for
hours
and
finally
at
dawn
cried
herself
to
sleep
the
first
serious
disagreement
however
came
just
before
graduation
austin
who
loved
to
dance
was
looking
forward
to
his
clever
sister
ball
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
and
pleasure
and
was
genuinely
amazed
when
sylvia
objected
violently
to
his
going
saying
that
as
she
could
not
dance
and
as
all
the
rest
of
the
family
would
be
there
katherine
did
not
need
him
and
that
he
had
much
better
stay
at
home
with
her
but
sylvia
protested
austin
i
to
go
i
awfully
proud
of
katherine
and
i
would
miss
it
for
anything
why
do
you
come
too
i
do
see
any
reason
why
you
should
of
course
you
do
you
were
brought
up
among
people
who
know
proper
in
such
matters
i
know
it
sylvia
but
if
that
going
to
trouble
you
you
should
have
thought
of
it
sooner
my
knowledge
of
etiquette
is
very
slight
i
admit
but
my
tells
me
that
announcing
one
engagement
should
be
equivalent
to
stopping
all
former
observances
of
mourning
i
did
want
to
announce
it
it
was
you
that
insisted
upon
that
too
well
you
know
why
said
austin
with
some
meaning
all
right
then
burst
out
sylvia
angrily
go
to
your
old
ball
you
seem
to
think
you
are
an
authority
on
everything
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
anyway
and
dance
with
a
lot
of
awkward
farmers
who
smell
of
the
i
should
think
you
would
care
about
it
either
now
that
you
had
a
chance
to
see
things
properly
done
i
care
a
good
deal
about
my
sister
sylvia
and
about
my
friends
here
too
there
are
no
better
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
heard
you
say
so
yourself
it
only
a
chance
that
i
a
little
less
awkward
than
some
of
the
others
the
result
of
this
conversation
was
that
austin
did
not
go
near
sylvia
for
several
days
he
was
deeply
hurt
but
that
was
not
all
he
began
to
wonder
even
more
than
he
ever
had
before
whether
his
comparative
poverty
his
lack
of
education
his
farmer
family
and
traditions
and
friends
were
not
very
real
barriers
between
himself
and
a
girl
like
sylvia
what
was
more
he
questioned
whether
a
strong
passionate
determined
man
who
felt
that
he
knew
his
own
best
course
and
proposed
to
take
it
could
ever
make
such
a
delicate
little
creature
happy
even
if
there
were
no
other
obstacles
in
their
path
than
those
of
warring
disposition
something
of
his
old
sullenness
of
manner
returned
and
his
mother
after
worrying
in
silence
over
him
for
a
time
finally
asked
him
what
the
trouble
was
at
first
he
denied
that
there
was
anything
next
stubbornly
refused
to
tell
her
what
it
was
and
at
last
like
a
hurt
schoolboy
blurted
out
his
grievance
to
his
amazement
and
grief
gray
took
sylvia
part
this
was
the
last
straw
he
jerked
himself
away
from
her
and
went
out
slamming
the
front
door
after
him
it
was
evening
and
he
was
tired
and
hot
and
dirty
the
rest
of
the
family
had
almost
finished
supper
when
he
reached
the
table
an
unexpected
delay
having
arisen
in
the
barn
and
he
had
eaten
the
unappetizing
scraps
that
remained
hurriedly
without
taking
time
to
shave
and
bathe
and
change
his
clothes
he
had
never
gone
to
sylvia
in
this
manner
before
but
he
strode
down
the
path
to
her
house
with
a
bitter
satisfaction
in
his
heart
that
she
was
to
see
him
when
he
was
looking
and
feeling
his
worst
and
that
she
would
have
to
take
him
as
he
was
or
not
at
all
he
found
her
in
her
garden
cutting
roses
a
picture
of
dainty
elegance
in
her
delicate
white
fabrics
she
greeted
him
somewhat
coolly
as
if
to
punish
him
for
his
lack
of
deference
to
her
on
his
last
visit
and
his
subsequent
neglect
and
glanced
at
his
costume
with
a
disapproval
which
she
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
then
with
a
sarcasm
and
lack
of
tact
which
she
had
never
shown
before
she
gave
voice
to
her
general
dissatisfaction
do
come
near
me
please
you
altogether
too
do
you
think
you
carrying
your
devotion
to
the
nobility
of
labor
a
little
too
far
and
your
devotion
to
me
if
you
still
have
any
not
quite
far
enough
you
slipping
straight
back
to
your
old
slovenly
disagreeable
ways
without
the
excuse
that
you
formerly
had
that
they
were
practically
the
only
ways
open
to
you
if
you
too
proud
to
accept
my
money
and
the
freedom
that
it
can
give
you
and
so
stubborn
that
you
make
a
scene
and
then
wo
come
near
me
for
days
because
i
refuse
to
go
to
a
cheap
little
public
dance
with
you
she
got
no
farther
austin
interrupted
her
with
a
violence
of
which
she
would
not
have
believed
him
capable
if
you
too
stubborn
to
go
with
me
to
my
sister
and
too
proud
to
accept
the
fact
that
i
a
with
a
farmer
friends
and
family
and
work
and
that
damned
glad
of
and
wo
give
them
up
or
be
supported
by
any
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or
let
her
make
a
pet
of
me
you
can
go
straight
back
to
the
life
you
came
from
for
all
me
you
seem
to
prefer
it
after
all
and
i
believe
it
all
you
deserve
if
you
do
do
ask
my
forgiveness
for
the
things
you
said
the
last
two
times
i
seen
you
and
say
go
to
that
with
me
and
be
just
as
darned
pleasant
to
every
one
there
as
you
know
how
to
be
and
promise
to
stop
quarrelling
and
keep
your
promise
i
never
come
near
you
again
you
making
my
life
utterly
miserable
you
wo
marry
me
and
yet
you
are
bound
to
have
me
make
love
to
you
all
the
time
when
i
doing
my
best
to
keep
my
hands
off
you
and
i
rather
be
shot
marry
you
on
the
terms
putting
up
to
me
at
present
you
got
two
days
to
think
it
over
in
and
if
you
do
send
for
me
before
it
time
to
start
for
the
ball
and
tell
me
you
sorry
you
wo
get
another
chance
to
send
for
me
again
as
long
as
you
live
i
either
not
worth
having
at
all
or
i
worth
treating
better
than
you
seen
fit
to
do
lately
he
left
her
without
even
looking
at
her
again
in
a
white
heat
of
fury
but
before
the
hot
dawn
of
another
june
day
had
given
him
an
excuse
to
get
up
and
try
to
work
off
his
feelings
with
the
most
strenuous
labor
that
he
could
find
he
had
spent
a
horrible
sleepless
night
which
he
was
never
to
forget
as
long
as
he
lived
his
anger
gave
way
first
to
misery
and
then
to
a
panic
of
fear
suppose
she
took
him
literally
though
he
had
meant
every
word
when
he
said
it
suppose
he
lost
her
what
would
the
rest
of
his
life
be
worth
to
him
alone
haunted
not
only
by
his
senseless
folly
in
casting
away
such
a
precious
treasure
but
by
his
ingratitude
his
presumption
and
his
own
unworthiness
a
dozen
times
he
started
towards
her
house
only
to
turn
back
again
she
been
fair
they
be
happy
that
way
if
he
gave
in
now
he
would
have
to
do
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
she
would
despise
him
for
it
as
the
time
which
he
had
stipulated
went
by
and
no
message
came
he
suffered
more
and
more
intensely
hoped
savagely
that
she
was
suffering
too
and
decided
that
she
could
not
be
or
that
he
would
have
heard
from
her
but
resolved
more
and
more
decidedly
with
every
hour
that
passed
that
he
would
fight
this
battle
out
to
the
bitter
end
it
was
even
later
than
usual
when
he
came
in
on
the
night
of
the
ball
and
when
he
entered
every
one
in
the
house
was
hurrying
about
in
the
inevitable
confusion
which
precedes
a
great
occasion
edith
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
be
ready
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
fresh
and
glowing
as
a
yellow
rose
in
her
bright
dress
peter
beside
her
buttoning
her
gloves
she
glanced
at
her
grimy
brother
with
a
feeble
interest
mercy
austin
you
better
hurry
we
going
to
leave
in
five
minutes
well
not
going
to
leave
in
five
minutes
i
got
to
get
out
of
these
clothes
and
have
a
bath
and
it
hardly
necessary
to
tell
me
all
that
one
glance
at
you
is
sufficient
said
edith
flippantly
well
i
can
come
on
later
alone
i
suppose
where
mother
still
dressing
why
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
sylvia
been
over
here
this
afternoon
or
sent
a
telephone
message
or
a
note
i
perfectly
sure
she
has
why
nothing
said
austin
grimly
and
left
the
room
like
most
people
who
try
to
dress
in
a
hurry
when
they
are
angry
austin
found
that
everything
went
wrong
there
was
no
hot
water
left
and
he
had
to
heat
some
himself
for
shaving
while
he
took
a
cold
bath
his
mother
usually
got
his
clothes
ready
for
him
when
she
knew
he
was
detained
but
this
time
she
had
apparently
been
too
rushed
herself
he
could
find
his
evening
shoes
he
could
get
his
studs
into
his
stiff
shirt
until
he
had
had
a
struggle
that
raised
his
temperature
several
degrees
higher
than
it
was
already
the
big
jolly
teamful
departed
while
he
was
rummaging
through
his
top
drawer
for
fresh
handkerchiefs
and
he
was
vainly
trying
to
adjust
his
white
tie
satisfactorily
when
a
knock
at
the
door
informed
him
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
house
after
all
he
said
come
in
crossly
and
without
turning
and
went
on
with
his
futile
attempts
has
every
one
else
gone
i
did
know
i
was
so
late
but
i
been
all
through
the
house
downstairs
calling
and
could
get
any
answer
let
me
do
that
for
you
let
take
a
fresh
one
he
wheeled
sharply
around
and
found
sylvia
standing
beside
him
sylvia
dressed
in
shimmering
satin
and
foamy
lace
with
pearls
in
her
dark
hair
and
golden
slippers
on
her
feet
her
neck
and
arms
white
and
bare
and
gleaming
with
a
little
sound
that
was
half
a
sob
and
half
a
cry
of
joy
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
down
to
hers
austin
i
i
sorry
i
do
beg
your
forgiveness
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
promise
and
i
keep
my
promise
to
be
reasonable
and
kind
and
fair
to
stop
making
you
miserable
it
been
all
my
fault
that
we
quarrelled
every
bit
and
we
never
will
again
i
come
to
tell
you
not
just
that
i
go
to
the
party
with
you
gladly
if
you
still
willing
to
take
me
but
that
there
nothing
that
matters
to
me
in
the
whole
world
except
you
the
first
touch
of
sylvia
arms
set
austin
brain
seething
after
the
hungry
misery
of
the
past
few
days
it
acted
like
wine
offered
to
a
starving
man
suddenly
snatched
and
drunk
her
words
her
tears
her
utter
of
voice
and
manner
annihilated
in
one
instant
the
restraint
in
which
he
had
held
himself
for
months
he
caught
the
delicate
little
creature
to
him
with
all
his
strength
burying
his
face
in
the
white
fragrance
of
her
neck
he
forgot
everything
in
the
world
except
that
she
was
in
his
arms
alone
with
him
that
nothing
was
to
come
between
them
again
as
long
as
they
lived
he
could
feel
her
heart
beating
against
his
under
the
soft
lace
on
her
breast
her
cool
cheeks
and
mouth
growing
warm
under
the
kisses
that
he
rained
on
them
until
his
own
lips
stung
at
first
she
returned
his
embrace
with
an
ardor
that
equalled
his
own
then
as
if
conscious
that
she
was
being
carried
away
by
the
might
of
a
power
which
she
could
neither
measure
nor
control
she
tried
to
turn
her
face
away
and
strove
to
free
herself
do
she
panted
let
me
go
you
me
austin
i
ca
help
it
i
sha
let
you
go
i
going
to
kiss
you
this
time
until
i
get
ready
to
stop
for
a
moment
she
struggled
vainly
austin
arms
tightened
about
her
like
bands
of
steel
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
lifted
her
face
again
i
ca
seem
to
kiss
back
any
more
she
whispered
but
if
this
is
what
you
want
if
it
will
make
up
to
you
for
these
last
weeks
it
matter
whether
you
hurt
or
not
every
particle
of
resistance
had
left
her
austin
had
wished
for
an
unconditional
surrender
and
he
had
certainly
attained
it
there
could
never
again
be
any
question
of
which
should
rule
she
had
come
and
laid
her
sweet
proud
rebellious
spirit
at
his
very
feet
begging
his
forgiveness
that
it
had
not
sooner
recognized
its
master
a
wonderful
surge
of
triumph
at
his
victory
swept
over
him
and
then
suddenly
he
was
sick
and
cold
with
shame
and
contrition
he
released
her
so
abruptly
that
she
staggered
catching
hold
of
a
chair
to
steady
herself
and
raising
one
small
clenched
hand
to
her
lips
as
if
to
press
away
their
smarting
as
she
did
so
he
saw
a
deep
red
mark
on
her
bare
white
arm
he
winced
as
if
he
had
been
struck
at
the
gesture
and
what
it
disclosed
but
it
needed
neither
to
show
him
that
she
was
bruised
and
hurt
from
the
violence
of
his
embrace
and
dreadful
as
he
instantly
realized
this
to
be
it
seemed
to
matter
very
little
if
he
could
only
learn
that
she
was
not
hurt
beyond
all
healing
by
divining
the
desire
and
intention
which
for
one
sacrilegious
moment
had
almost
mastered
him
a
gauzy
scarf
which
she
had
carried
when
she
entered
the
room
had
fallen
to
the
floor
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
stood
looking
at
it
running
it
through
his
hands
his
head
bent
it
was
white
and
sheer
a
mere
gossamer
he
must
have
stepped
on
it
for
in
one
place
it
was
torn
in
another
slightly
soiled
sylvia
watching
him
holding
her
breath
could
see
the
muscles
of
his
white
face
growing
tenser
and
tenser
around
his
set
mouth
and
still
he
did
not
glance
at
her
or
speak
to
her
at
last
he
unfolded
it
to
its
full
size
and
wrapped
it
about
her
his
eyes
giving
her
the
smile
which
his
lips
could
not
nothing
matters
to
me
in
the
whole
world
either
except
you
he
said
brokenly
i
think
these
last
few
dreadful
days
have
shown
us
both
how
much
we
need
each
other
and
that
the
memory
of
them
will
keep
us
closer
together
all
our
lives
if
there
any
question
of
forgiveness
between
us
it
all
on
my
side
now
not
yours
and
i
do
think
i
can
talk
about
it
now
but
i
never
forget
how
you
came
to
me
and
please
god
some
day
i
be
more
worthy
of
of
your
love
and
and
your
than
i
shown
myself
now
until
i
am
he
stopped
and
lifting
her
arm
kissed
the
bruise
which
his
own
roughness
had
made
there
what
can
i
do
to
make
that
better
he
managed
to
say
it
did
hurt
much
before
and
it
all
healed
now
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
did
your
mother
ever
the
place
to
make
it
well
when
you
were
a
little
boy
and
did
it
always
work
like
a
charm
it
wo
show
at
all
either
under
my
glove
your
glove
he
asked
stupidly
and
then
suddenly
remembering
what
he
had
entirely
forgotten
oh
we
were
going
to
a
ball
together
you
came
to
tell
me
you
would
after
all
but
surely
you
wo
want
to
now
why
not
we
can
take
the
motor
we
wo
be
so
very
late
the
others
went
in
the
carryall
you
know
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
away
from
her
all
right
he
said
at
last
go
downstairs
and
get
your
cloak
if
you
left
it
there
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
she
obeyed
without
a
word
but
waited
so
long
that
she
grew
alarmed
and
finally
unable
to
endure
her
anxiety
any
longer
she
went
back
upstairs
austin
door
was
open
into
the
hall
but
it
was
dark
in
his
room
and
genuinely
frightened
she
groped
her
way
towards
the
electric
switch
in
doing
so
she
stumbled
against
the
bed
and
her
hand
fell
on
shoulder
he
was
kneeling
there
his
whole
body
shaking
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
instantly
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
him
my
darling
boy
what
is
it
austin
you
break
my
heart
the
marvel
is
if
i
have
just
now
i
told
your
uncle
that
i
was
afraid
i
would
some
time
that
i
knew
i
had
any
right
to
you
but
i
did
think
that
even
i
was
bad
enough
to
fail
you
like
you
failed
me
you
a
right
to
me
i
never
loved
you
so
much
in
all
my
life
she
hurried
on
almost
incoherently
searching
for
words
of
comfort
dearest
will
it
make
you
feel
any
better
if
i
say
i
marry
you
right
away
what
do
you
mean
when
if
you
like
oh
austin
i
love
you
so
that
it
does
matter
a
bit
whether
i
afraid
or
not
the
only
thing
that
really
counts
is
to
have
you
happy
and
since
i
realized
that
i
find
that
i
not
afraid
of
anything
in
the
whole
world
and
that
i
want
to
belong
to
you
as
much
and
as
soon
as
you
can
possibly
want
to
have
me
it
was
many
months
before
hamstead
stopped
talking
about
the
graduation
ball
of
that
year
it
surpassed
to
an
almost
extraordinary
degree
any
that
had
ever
been
held
there
but
the
event
upon
which
the
village
best
loved
to
dwell
was
the
entrance
of
sylvia
cary
the
loveliest
vision
it
had
ever
beheld
on
austin
gray
arm
when
all
the
other
guests
were
already
there
and
everyone
had
despaired
of
their
coming
following
the
unwritten
law
in
country
places
which
decrees
that
all
persons
engaged
married
or
keeping
company
must
have
their
first
dance
together
she
gave
that
to
austin
then
thomas
and
james
frank
and
fred
peter
and
even
gray
and
elliott
all
claimed
their
turn
and
by
that
time
austin
was
waiting
impatiently
again
but
country
parties
are
long
and
before
the
night
was
over
all
the
men
and
boys
who
had
been
watching
her
in
church
and
bowing
when
they
met
her
in
the
road
and
seizing
every
possible
chance
to
speak
to
her
when
they
went
to
the
homestead
on
errands
or
excuses
for
errands
had
demanded
and
been
given
a
dance
she
was
lighter
than
thistledown
indeed
there
were
moments
when
she
seemed
scarcely
a
woman
at
all
but
a
mere
essence
of
fragile
beauty
and
sweetness
and
graciousness
it
had
been
generally
conceded
beforehand
that
the
honors
of
the
ball
would
all
go
to
edith
but
even
edith
herself
admitted
that
she
took
a
second
place
and
that
she
was
glad
to
take
it
dawn
was
turning
the
quiet
valley
and
distant
mountains
into
a
riotous
rosy
glory
when
as
they
drove
slowly
up
to
her
house
austin
gently
raised
the
gossamer
scarf
which
had
blown
over
sylvia
face
it
from
him
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
to
answer
his
are
you
very
tired
dear
not
at
all
just
too
happy
to
talk
much
that
all
sylvia
yes
darling
you
know
i
have
planned
to
start
west
with
peter
three
days
after
sally
wedding
yes
would
you
rather
i
did
go
no
i
glad
you
going
i
mean
i
glad
you
have
decided
to
keep
to
your
plan
what
makes
you
think
i
have
because
being
you
you
could
do
otherwise
but
when
i
come
back
her
fingers
tightened
in
his
i
want
two
months
all
alone
with
you
in
this
little
house
he
whispered
send
the
servants
away
it
wo
be
very
hard
to
do
the
work
for
just
us
two
i
help
that
that
a
big
wedding
and
a
public
honeymoon
and
all
that
go
with
them
are
just
a
cheap
imitation
of
the
real
thing
then
later
on
if
you
like
this
first
winter
we
go
away
together
to
spain
or
italy
or
the
south
of
france
or
wherever
you
wish
but
first
we
begin
together
here
will
you
marry
me
the
first
of
september
sylvia
austin
drove
home
in
the
broad
daylight
of
four
on
a
june
morning
then
after
the
motor
was
put
away
he
took
his
working
clothes
over
his
arm
went
to
the
river
and
plunged
in
when
he
came
back
with
damp
hair
cool
skin
and
a
heart
singing
with
peace
and
joy
he
found
peter
whistling
starting
towards
the
barn
with
his
over
his
arm
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
day
chapter
xvii
i
sarah
take
thee
frederick
to
my
wedded
husband
to
have
and
to
hold
from
this
day
forward
for
better

worse
for
richer
for
poorer
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
love
cherish
and
to
obey
till
death
us
do
part
according
to
god
holy
ordinance
and
thereto
i
give
thee
my
troth
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
was
ticking
very
distinctly
the
scent
of
roses
in
the
crowded
room
made
the
air
heavy
with
sweetness
the
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
flickered
in
the
breeze
from
the
open
window
outside
a
was
singing
in
the
lilac
bushes
with
this
ring
i
thee
wed
and
with
all
my
worldly
goods
i
thee
endow
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
amen
an
involuntary
tear
rolled
down
gray
cheek
to
be
hastily
concealed
and
wiped
away
with
her
new
lace
handkerchief
her
husband
was
looking
straight
ahead
of
him
very
hard
at
nothing
ruth
adjusted
the
big
white
bow
on
little
elsie
curls
sylvia
felt
for
austin
hand
behind
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
found
it
groping
for
hers
then
suddenly
the
spell
was
broken
the
minister
was
shaking
hands
with
the
bride
and
groom
sally
was
taking
her
bouquet
from
molly
every
one
was
laughing
and
talking
at
once
crowding
up
to
offer
congratulations
handling
admiring
and
discussing
the
wedding
presents
over
each
other
with
haste
and
excitement
delicious
smells
began
to
issue
from
the
kitchen
and
the
long
was
quickly
laden
down
sylvia
took
her
place
at
one
end
behind
the
molly
at
the
other
end
behind
the
strawberries
and
katherine
edith
and
the
boys
flew
around
passing
plates
cakes
of
all
kinds
great
sugared
doughnuts
and
fat
cookies
sally
was
borne
into
the
room
triumphant
on
a
chair
made
of
her
brothers
arms
to
cut
and
distribute
the
cake
then
when
every
one
had
eaten
as
much
as
was
humanly
possible
the
piano
was
moved
out
to
the
great
new
barn
with
its
fine
concrete
floors
swept
and
scoured
as
only
peter
could
do
it
and
its
every
stall
festooned
with
white
crepe
paper
by
sylvia
and
the
dancing
began
for
this
time
the
crowd
was
too
great
to
permit
it
in
the
house
in
spite
of
the
spacious
rooms
molly
and
sylvia
took
turns
in
playing
and
each
found
several
eager
partners
waiting
for
her
every
time
the
shift
occurred
finally
about
midnight
the
bride
went
upstairs
to
change
her
dress
and
the
girls
gathered
around
the
banisters
to
be
ready
to
catch
the
bouquet
when
she
came
down
laughing
and
teasing
each
other
while
they
waited
great
shouts
arose
and
much
joking
began
when
edith
and
not
sylvia
as
every
one
had
privately
hoped
caught
the
huge
bunch
of
flowers
and
ribbon
and
ran
with
it
in
her
arms
out
on
the
wide
piazza
all
the
others
behind
her
to
be
ready
to
pelt
sally
and
fred
with
rice
when
they
appeared
thomas
was
to
drive
them
to
the
station
and
motor
was
bedecked
with
white
garlands
and
bows
slippers
and
bells
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
at
last
the
rush
came
and
the
happy
victims
showered
and
dishevelled
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
were
whisked
up
the
hill
and
out
of
sight
sylvia
insisted
on
staying
to
begin
straightening
out
the
worst
of
the
mess
as
soon
as
the
last
guest
had
gone
and
on
remaining
overnight
sleeping
in
sally
old
room
with
molly
to
be
on
hand
and
go
on
with
the
good
work
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
sadie
and
james
had
to
leave
on
the
afternoon
train
as
james
had
stretched
his
leave
of
absence
from
business
to
the
very
last
degree
already
so
by
evening
the
house
was
painfully
tidy
again
and
so
quiet
that
gray
declared
it
gave
her
the
blues
just
to
listen
to
it
the
next
night
was
to
be
austin
last
one
at
home
and
he
had
promised
sylvia
to
go
and
take
supper
with
her
but
just
before
six
the
telephone
rang
and
she
knew
that
something
had
happened
to
disappoint
her
is
that
you
sylvia
yes
dear
carter
the
president
of
the
wallacetown
bank
you
know
has
just
called
me
up
there
going
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
bank
officers
just
after
the
fourth
as
they
decided
to
enlarge
their
board
of
directors
and
add
at
least
one
young
farmer
as
he
put
it
and
oh
sylvia
he
asked
if
i
would
allow
my
name
to
be
proposed
just
think
after
all
the
years
when
we
could
get
a
from
them
at
any
rate
of
interest
to
have
that
come
it
every
bit
due
to
you
it
is
either
it
due
to
the
splendid
work
you
done
this
last
year
well
we
wo
stop
to
discuss
that
now
he
wants
me
to
drive
up
and
see
him
about
it
right
away
do
you
mind
if
i
take
the
motor
i
can
make
so
much
better
time
and
get
back
to
you
so
much
more
quickly
but
i
come
to
supper
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
go
i
never
should
forgive
you
if
you
did
that
wonderful
news
hurry
i
be
glad
to
see
you
whatever
time
you
get
back
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
sat
motionless
beside
the
instrument
too
thrilled
for
the
moment
to
move
what
a
man
he
was
proving
himself
her
farmer
and
yet
how
each
new
responsibility
well
fulfilled
was
going
to
take
him
more
and
more
from
her
she
sighed
involuntarily
and
was
about
to
rise
when
the
bell
sounded
again
hullo
she
said
courteously
but
tonelessly
the
bottom
of
the
evening
had
dropped
out
for
her
it
mattered
very
little
how
she
spent
it
now
until
austin
arrived

other
evenin
to
get
a
nightgown
pattern
she
thought
was
real
tasty
i
do
know
as
i
shall
like
it
though
it
supposed
to
have
a
yoke
made
out
of
crochet
or
tattin
at
the
top
an
i
ai
got
anything
of
the
kind
on
hand
just
now
an
no
time
to
make
any
besides
i
never
thought
these
garments
was
just
the
thing
for
a
respectable
woman
there
ai
enough
to
when
i
was
young
they
was
made
of
good
thick
cotton
an
trimmed
with
hamburg
edgin
an
buttoned
down
the
front
speakin
of
nightgowns
how
are
you
gettin
on
with
your
trousseau
have
you
decided
what
you
goin
to
wear
for
a
dress
i
was
readin
in
the
paper
the
other
day
about
some
widow
that
got
married
down
in
boston
an
she
wore
a
pink
dress
i
was
real
shocked
if
she
ben
a
divorced
person
i
should
have
expected
some
such
thing
but
there
war
anything
of
the
kind
in
this
case
she
was
a
decent
young
woman
an
real
pretty
judgin
from
her
picture
but
i
should
have
thought
she
have
wore
gray
or
lavender
would
you
there
ought
to
be
anything
gay
about
a
second
weddin
well
as
i
was
to
joe
about
the
minister
wife
what
that
you
think
they
both
real
nice
an
you
glad
he
got
sort
of
a
wife
now
sylvia
i
always
did
think
you
was
a
little
mite
hard
on
jessup
i
says
to
joe
sylvia
a
nice
girl
but
she
a
flirt
sure
as
you
there
an
joe
says
have
you
heard
from
fred
and
sally
yet
yes
they
sent
us
three
picture
real
pretty
there
much
space
for
news
on
though
they
just
show
a
bridge
an
a
park
an
a
railroad
station
still
of
course
we
was
glad
to
get
an
they
seem
to
be
havin
a
fine
time
i
heard
that
ruth
baby
was
sick
again
delicate
ai
it
i
should
be
a
mite
surprised
if
ruth
could
raise
her
around
the
eyes
i
says
to
joe
the
first
time
i
ever
clapped
eyes
on
her
an
then
ruth
ai
got
no
to
her
shiftless
same
howard
is
though
she
just
as
i
hear
she
thinkin
of
keepin
a
hired
girl
all
summer
frank
business
do
warrant
it
he
has
a
real
hard
time
along
he
too
with
his
customers
gives
long
credit
when
they
hard
up
an
all
that
of
course
it
nice
to
be
charitable
if
you
can
afford
it
but
frank
is
going
to
pay
the
hired
girl
there
you
go
again
sylvia
you
kinder
remind
me
of
the
widow
cruse
never
failin
many
families
gets
hold
of
anything
like
you
well
i
must
be
sayin
there
seems
to
be
several
people
tryin
to
butt
in
an
use
this
line
though
probably
they
do
want
it
for
anything
important
at
all
i
got
no
patience
with
folks
that
uses
the
telephone
as
a
means
of
gossip
an
interfere
with
those
that
really
needs
it
besides
though
i
be
glad
to
talk
with
you
a
little
longer

plum
tuckered

with
the
heat

i
said

a
little
too
hard

poor
lonely
girl

set

me
some
day
soon

always
real
pleased
to
see
you
sylvia
leaned
back
laughing
elliott
who
infuriated
thomas
and
exasperated
austin
was
a
source
of
enjoyment
to
her
she
went
back
to
the
porch
to
wait
for
austin
still
chuckling
after
the
conversation
she
had
had
with
him
she
was
greatly
surprised
when
a
little
after
eight
the
garden
gate
clicked
she
ran
down
the
steps
hurriedly
with
his
name
on
her
lips
but
the
figure
coming
towards
her
through
the
dusk
was
much
smaller
than
austin
and
a
voice
answered
her
in
broken
english
it
ai
gray
missus

peter

said
in
amazement

farm

up
and

he
stood
fumbling
at
his
hat
for
a
minute
and
then
settled
himself
awkwardly
on
the
steps
at
her
feet
his
yellow
hair
was
sleekly
brushed
his
face
shone
with
soap
and
water
and
he
had
on
his
best
clothes
it
was
quiet
evident
that
he
had
come
with
the
distinct
purpose
of
making
a
call
can
dose
domestics
hear
vat
ve
say
he
asked
at
length
turning
his
wide
blue
eyes
upon
her
after
some
minutes
of
heavy
silence
not
a
word

my
best
peter
but
i
promise
anything
edith
is
the
kind
of
girl
as
you
say
that
likes
to
have
and
i
have
no
real
authority
over
her
as
if
the
object
of
his
visit
was
entirely
accomplished
peter
rose
to
leave
i
you
ver
much
missus
he
said
politely
it
a
varm
evening
not
goodnight
for
a
few
minutes
after
peter
left
sylvia
sat
thinking
over
what
he
had
said
and
her
own
face
grew
vorried
too
then
the
garden
gate
clicked
again
and
for
the
next
two
hours
she
was
too
happy
for
trouble
of
any
kind
to
touch
her
austin
interview
with
carter
had
proved
a
great
success
and
after
that
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
they
found
a
great
deal
to
say
about
their
own
plans
for
september
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
all
that
peter
had
said
it
came
back
to
her
vividly
enough
a
few
nights
later
she
had
sat
up
very
late
writing
to
austin
and
was
still
lying
awake
long
after
midnight
when
she
heard
the
whirr
of
a
motor
near
by
and
a
moment
later
a
soft
voice
calling
under
her
window
she
threw
a
negligee
about
her
and
ran
to
the
front
door
as
she
unlatched
it
edith
slipped
in
her
finger
on
her
lips
hush
do
let
the
servants
hear
oh
sylvia
i
had
such
a
lark
will
you
keep
me
overnight
i
would
gladly
but
your
mother
would
be
worried
to
death
no
she
wo
you
see
i
found
two
hours
ago
that
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
i
got
back
and
i
telephoned
her
saying
i
was
going
to
spend
the
night
with
you
do
you
understand
she
thought
i
was
here
then
edith
you
did
lie
to
your
mother
now
sylvia
do
begin
to
scold
at
this
hour
when
i
tired
and
sleepy
as
i
can
be
it
was
my
fault
we
burst
two
tires
was
it
but
mother
prejudiced
against
hugh
just
because
sally
who
a
perfect
prude
did
happen
to
like
him
lend
me
one
of
your
delicious
do
and
let
me
cuddle
down
beside
you
the
bed
so
big
you
never
know
i
there
sylvia
mechanically
opened
a
drawer
and
handed
her
the
garment
she
requested
gracious
sylvia
it
like
a
cobweb
perhaps
if
i
marry
a
rich
man
i
can
have
things
like
this
what
an
angel
you
look
in
yours
austin
will
certainly
think
he
struck
heaven
when
he
sees
you
like
that
i
never
could
understand
what
a
little
thing
like
you
wanted
this
huge
bed
for
but
of
course
you
knew
when
you
bought
it
edith
interrupted
sylvia
sharply
be
quiet
in
the
morning
i
want
to
talk
with
you
a
little
but
as
she
lay
awake
long
after
the
young
girl
had
fallen
into
a
deep
quiet
sleep
she
felt
sadly
puzzled
to
know
what
she
could
with
wisdom
and
helpfulness
say
it
was
so
usual
in
the
country
for
young
girls
to
ride
about
alone
at
night
with
their
admirers
so
much
the
accepted
custom
of
which
no
harm
seemed
to
come
that
however
much
she
might
personally
disapprove
of
such
a
course
she
could
not
reasonably
find
fault
with
it
it
was
probably
her
own
sense
of
outraged
delicacy
she
tried
to
think
after
edith
careless
speech
that
made
her
feel
that
the
child
lacked
the
innate
and
quiet
attractiveness
which
her
sisters
all
less
pretty
than
she
possessed
to
such
a
marked
extent
in
spite
of
their
lack
of
polish
she
tried
to
think
that
it
was
only
she
had
noticed
how
red
and
full
edith
pouting
lips
were
growing
how
careless
she
was
about
the
depth
of
her
blouses
how
unusually
lacking
in
shyness
and
restraint
for
one
so
young
in
the
morning
she
said
nothing
and
edith
was
secretly
much
relieved
but
she
went
and
asked
gray
if
she
could
not
spare
her
youngest
daughter
for
a
visit
while
austin
was
away
to
ward
off
loneliness
she
found
the
good
lady
out
in
the
garden
weeding
her
petunias
and
bent
over
to
help
her
as
she
made
her
request
there
dearie
do
you
bother
you
get
your
pretty
dress
all
and
it
looks
to
me
like
another
new
one
i
would
have
thought
would
be
so
becomin
to
you
sylvia
i
always
fancied
it
for
a
blonde
mostly
but
there
you
got
such
lovely
skin
anything
looks
well
on
you
do
you
like
petunias
scarcely
anyone
has
them
cinnamon
pinks
an
any
more
it
all
nasturtiums
an
such
but
to
me
there
ai
any
flower
any
handsomer
than
a
big
purple
petunia
i
like
them
too
and
it
does
matter
if
my
dress
does
get
dirty
now
about
edith
why
sylvia
you
know
how
i
hate
to
deny
you
anything
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
spare
her
here
it
is
the
busiest
time
of
the
year
an
austin
an
peter
both
gone
i
have
a
word
to
say
against
them
young
fellows
that
thomas
has
fetched
home
from
college
to
help
while
our
boys
are
gone
they
obligin
chaps
as
i
ever
see
but
the
work
do
go
the
same
as
it
do
when
your
own
folks
is
it
just
the
same
besides
sally
not
here
to
help
like
she
always
been
before
summers
an
it
makes
a
pile
of
difference
i
can
tell
you
molly
can
play
the
piano
somethin
wonderful
an
katherine
can
spout
poetry
to
beat
anything
i
ever
heard
but
edith
can
get
out
a
whole
week
washin
while
either
one
of
is
where
she
to
get
the
hot
water
to
do
it
with
an
she
a
real
good
cook
i
never
see
a
girl
of
her
years
more
capable
if
i
do
say
so
an
she
always
looks
as
neat
an
pretty
as
a
new
pin
whatever
she
doin
too
why
do
you
come
over
to
us
if
you
lonely
we
all
admire
to
have
you
there
we
got
that
row
cleaned
out
real
good
we
tackle
the
candytuft
now
if
you
feel
like
it
sylvia
would
gladly
have
offered
to
pay
for
a
competent
hired
girl
but
she
did
not
dare
to
for
fear
of
displeasing
austin
so
she
wrote
to
uncle
mat
to
postpone
his
prospective
visit
to
the
great
disappointment
of
them
both
and
filled
her
tiny
house
with
young
friends
instead
urging
edith
to
spend
as
much
time
helping
her
amuse
them
as
she
could
to
the
latter
great
delight
unfortunately
the
girl
and
one
of
the
boys
whom
she
had
invited
were
already
so
much
interested
in
each
other
that
they
had
eyes
for
no
one
else
and
the
other
fellow
was
a
quiet
studious
chap
who
vastly
preferred
reading
aloud
to
sylvia
to
canoeing
with
edith
the
girl
was
somewhat
piqued
by
this
lack
of
appreciation
and
quickly
deserted
sylvia
guests
for
the
more
lively
charms
of
hugh
elliott
red
motor
and
jack
weston
spruce
runabout
and
gray
saw
no
harm
in
their
pet
escapades
but
on
the
contrary
secretly
rejoiced
that
the
humble
peter
was
at
least
temporarily
removed
and
other
and
richer
suitors
occupying
the
foreground
they
were
far
from
being
worldly
people
but
two
of
their
daughters
having
already
married
poor
men
they
having
had
more
than
their
own
fair
share
of
drudgery
could
not
help
hoping
that
this
pretty
butterfly
might
be
spared
the
coarser
labors
of
life
sylvia
longed
to
write
austin
all
about
it
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
spoil
his
trip
by
speaking
slightingly
and
perhaps
unjustly
of
his
favorite
sister
conduct
as
she
had
rather
feared
the
short
trip
originally
planned
proved
so
instructive
and
delightful
that
it
was
lengthened
first
by
a
few
days
and
then
by
a
fortnight
so
that
one
week
in
august
was
already
gone
before
he
returned
he
came
back
in
holiday
spirits
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
about
his
trip
full
of
new
plans
and
arrangements
his
enthusiasm
was
contagious
and
he
would
talk
of
nothing
and
allow
her
to
talk
of
nothing
except
themselves
my
but
it
good
to
be
back
i
do
see
how
i
ever
stayed
away
so
long
you
did
seem
to
have
much
difficulty
every
time
you
wrote
it
was
to
say
you
be
gone
a
little
longer
i
suppose
some
of
those
new
york
farmers
have
pretty
daughters
you
better
be
careful
or
i
box
your
ears
what
mischief
have
been
up
to
i
heard
rumors
about
some
bookish
chap
who
read
sonnets
and
sighed
at
the
moon
you
see
i
informed
i
take
care
how
i
leave
you
again
you
had
better
i
wo
promise
to
wait
for
you
so
patiently
next
time
do
talk
to
me
about
patient
waiting
sylvia
is
it
really
honestly
true
i
only
got
three
more
weeks
of
it
it
really
honestly
true
darling
you
go
home
and
only
got
three
weeks
more
of
being
able
to
say
that
i
suppose
i
must
obey
but
remember
have
to
promise
to
obey
pretty
soon
i
be
glad
to
austin
yes
dear
sylvia
i
think
your
cheeks
are
softer
than
ever
i
do
think
edith
looks
very
well
do
you
why
i
thought
she
never
was
so
pretty
but
now
you
speak
of
it
she
seem
a
little
fagged
not
fresh
the
way
you
always
are
too
much
gadding
i
afraid
i
afraid
so
could
you
my
dear
girl
leave
all
that
to
peter
i
got
hands
full
keeping
in
order
sylvia
there
one
thing
this
trip
has
convinced
me
we
got
to
have
right
away
and
that
more
motors
we
got
the
land
we
got
the
buildings
and
we
got
the
stock
but
we
simply
must
stop
wasting
time
and
grain
on
so
many
horses
it
terribly
out
of
date
to
say
nothing
else
against
it
we
need
a
for
the
family
and
a
runabout
for
you
and
me
do
sell
that
great
ark
of
yours
and
get
something
you
can
learn
to
run
yourself
and
that
wo
use
half
the
gasoline
and
a
tractor
to
plough
with
and
a
truck
to
take
the
cream
to
the
creamery
well
i
suppose
you
let
me
give
these
various
things
for
christmas
presents
wo
you
you
so
awfully
afraid
that
i
contribute
the
least
little
bit
to
the
success
of
the
farm
that
i
hardly
dare
ask
but
i
could
bestow
the
tractor
on
thomas
the
truck
on
your
father
and
the
on
the
girls
and
certainly
we
need
the
runabout
for
trips
on
sundays
after
the
first
of
september
all
right
i
concede
the
motors
as
your
share
now
what
will
you
give
me
for
a
reward
for
being
so
docile
she
watched
him
down
the
path
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
happiness
twice
he
turned
back
to
wave
his
hand
to
her
then
disappeared
whistling
into
the
darkness
she
knelt
beside
her
bed
for
a
long
time
that
night
and
finally
fell
into
a
deep
quiet
sleep
her
hand
clasping
the
little
star
that
hung
about
her
throat
three
hours
later
she
was
abruptly
awakened
and
sat
up
confused
and
startled
to
find
austin
leaning
over
her
shaking
her
gently
and
calling
her
name
in
a
low
troubled
voice
what
is
it
what
has
happened
she
murmured
drowsily
reaching
instinctively
for
the
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
austin
had
already
begun
to
wrap
it
around
her
forgive
me
sweetheart
for
disturbing
you
and
for
coming
in
like
this
i
tried
the
telephone
and
called
you
over
and
over
again
outside
your
window
you
must
have
been
awfully
sound
asleep
i
was
at
my
wits
end
and
could
think
of
anything
to
do
but
this
are
you
very
angry
with
me
no
no
why
did
you
need
me
oh
sylvia
it
edith
she
terribly
sick
and
she
keeps
begging
for
you
so
that
i
just
to
come
and
get
you
she
was
all
right
at
it
so
sudden
and
violent
that
sylvia
had
slipped
out
of
bed
as
if
hardly
conscious
that
he
was
beside
her
go
out
on
the
porch
and
wait
for
me
she
commanded
breathlessly
you
got
the
motor
have
you
i
wo
be
but
a
minute
she
was
indeed
scarcely
longer
than
that
they
were
almost
instantly
speeding
down
the
road
together
while
she
asked
have
you
sent
for
the
doctor
yes
but
there
is
any
there
yet
wells
was
off
on
a
confinement
case
and
we
had
to
telephone
to
wallacetown
she
was
perfectly
determined
not
to
have
one
anyway
oh
sylvia
what
can
it
be
and
why
should
she
want
you
so
i
do
know
yet
dear
do
you
suppose
she
going
to
die
no
i
afraid
i
mean
i
do
think
she
is
why
did
i
take
better
care
of
her
austin
ca
you
drive
any
faster
as
they
reached
the
house
she
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
swiftly
up
the
stairs
and
gray
were
both
standing
white
and
helpless
with
terror
beside
their
daughter
bed
she
was
lying
quite
still
when
sylvia
entered
but
suddenly
a
violent
spasm
of
pain
shook
her
like
a
leaf
and
she
flung
her
hands
above
her
head
groaning
between
her
clenched
teeth
sylvia
bent
over
her
and
took
her
in
her
arms
my
dear
little
sister
she
said
chapter
xviii
when
the
long
hideous
night
was
over
and
edith
lay
very
white
and
still
her
wide
frightened
eyes
never
leaving
sylvia
face
the
doctor
gathering
up
his
belongings
touched
the
latter
lightly
on
the
arm
she
have
to
have
constant
care
for
several
days
perfect
quiet
for
two
weeks
at
least
but
if
i
send
for
a
nurse
i
know
i
sure
i
can
do
everything
necessary
for
her
i
had
some
experience
with
sickness
before
the
doctor
nodded
a
look
of
relief
and
satisfaction
passing
over
his
face
i
see
that
you
have
get
her
to
drink
this
she
must
have
some
sleep
at
once
but
when
sylvia
left
alone
with
her
held
the
glass
to
edith
lips
she
shrank
back
in
terror
no
no
no
i
do
want
to
go
to
sleep
i
must
i
shall
dream
dear
child
you
wo
and
if
you
do
i
shall
be
right
here
beside
you
holding
your
hand
like
this
and
you
can
feel
it
and
know
that
after
all
dreams
are
slight
things
you
promise
me
indeed
i
do
oh
sylvia
you
so
brave
you
told
the
doctor
you
taken
care
of
some
one
that
was
sick
before
who
was
it
it
was
sylvia
turn
to
shudder
but
she
controlled
it
quickly
and
spoke
very
quietly
i
was
married
for
two
years
to
a
man
who
finally
died
of
delirium
tremens
no
paid
nurse
would
have
stayed
with
him
through
certain
times
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
dear
and
i
trying
hard
to
forget
it
you
wo
ask
me
about
it
again
will
you
oh
please
forgive
me
i
i
did
guess
i
drink
the
medicine
or
do
anything
else
you
say
so
edith
fell
asleep
and
when
she
woke
again
the
sun
was
setting
and
sylvia
still
sat
beside
her
their
fingers
intertwined
sylvia
looked
down
smiling
the
doctor
has
been
here
to
see
you
but
you
did
wake
and
we
both
felt
it
was
better
not
to
disturb
you
he
thinks
that
all
is
going
well
with
you
will
you
drink
some
milk
and
let
me
bathe
your
face
and
hands
no
not
not
yet
have
you
really
been
here
all
these
hours
yes
dear
with
no
rest
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
oh
yes
austin
brought
me
my
dinner
but
i
ate
it
sitting
beside
you
and
would
let
him
stay
he
so
big
he
ca
help
making
a
noise
does
he
know
not
yet
and
father
and
mother
sylvia
was
silent
oh
sylvia
i
a
wicked
wicked
girl
but
i
not
what
you
must
think
i
not
a
a
murderess
peter
came
up
behind
me
on
the
stairs
in
the
dark
last
night
and
spoke
to
me
suddenly
it
startled
me
everything
seems
to
have
startled
me
lately
and
i
slipped
and
fell
and
hurt
myself
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
you
poor
child
you
do
need
to
tell
me
that
i
never
would
have
believed
it
of
you
for
a
single
instant
then
she
added
in
the
strained
voice
which
she
could
not
help
using
on
the
very
rare
occasions
when
she
forced
herself
to
speak
of
something
that
had
occurred
during
her
marriage
but
still
as
if
she
felt
that
no
word
which
might
give
comfort
should
be
left
unsaid
perhaps
your
mother
has
told
you
that
the
little
baby
who
died
when
it
was
two
weeks
old
was
the
first
that
i
expected
a
fall
or
or
a
blow
or
any
shock
of
fear
or
grief
often
ends
in
a
disaster
like
this
will
the
others
believe
me
too
of
course
they
will
do
talk
dear
it
going
to
be
all
right
i
must
talk
i
got
to
tell
i
got
to
tell
and
you
can
explain
to
the
family
you
always
understand
everything
and
you
never
blame
anybody
i
often
wonder
why
it
is
you
so
good
yourself
and
yet
you
never
say
a
word
against
any
living
creature
or
let
anybody
else
do
it
when
you
around
but
lots
of
girls
who
done
just
what
i
have
and
did
happen
to
get
found
out
are
the
ones
who
speak
most
bitterly
and
cruelly
i
know
two
or
three
who
will
be
just
if
they
know
they
not
going
to
know
then
you
will
listen
and
and
believe
me
and
yes
edith
i
thought
it
happened
only
in
books
or
when
girls
had
no
one
to
take
care
of
them
not
to
girls
with
fathers
and
mothers
and
good
homes
did
you
sylvia
no
dear
i
knew
it
happened
sometimes
oh
more
often
than
to
girls
just
like
you
and
what
happens
afterwards
sylvia
shuddered
but
it
was
too
dark
in
the
carefully
shuttered
room
for
edith
to
see
her
she
said
quite
quietly
that
depends
in
many
cases
nothing
dreadful
ever
anything
good
yes
yes
things
can
happen
they
can
be
to
will
you
make
good
things
happen
to
me
i
will
indeed
i
will
and
not
hate
me
never
that
may
i
tell
you
now
if
you
believe
that
it
will
make
you
feel
better
and
if
you
will
promise
after
you
have
told
me
to
let
me
give
you
the
treatment
you
need
i
promise
do
you
remember
that
in
the
spring
hugh
elliott
came
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
with
fred
sylvia
fingers
twitched
but
all
she
said
was
yes
edith
he
used
to
be
in
love
with
sally
but
he
got
all
over
that
he
said
he
was
in
love
with
me
i
thought
he
was
he
certainly
acted
that
way
saying
fresh
things
and
and
always
trying
to
touch
me
and
that
the
way
men
usually
do
when
they
begin
to
fall
in
love
is
it
sylvia
no
darling
not
not
some
kinds
of
men
and
thoughts
flew
back
for
one
happy
instant
to
the
man
who
had
knelt
at
her
feet
on
christmas
night
but
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
liked
it
i
mean
i
thought
the
talk
was
fun
to
listen
to
and
that
the
rest
was
oh
sylvia
do
you
understand
yes
dear
i
understand
and
he
was
awfully
jolly
and
gave
me
such
a
good
time
i
felt
flattered
to
think
he
did
treat
me
like
a
child
that
he
paid
me
more
attention
than
the
older
girls
yes
edith
and
i
thought
what
fun
it
would
be
to
marry
him
instead
of
some
slow
poky
farmer
and
have
a
beautiful
house
and
servants
and
lovely
clothes
i
kept
thinking
every
night
he
would
ask
me
to
but
he
did
and
finally
one
time
just
before
we
got
home
after
a
dance
he
said
he
was
going
away
in
the
morning
yes
edith
oh
i
was
so
disappointed
and
sore
and
angry
that
was
it
just
plain
angry
i
had
been
going
with
jack
all
along
when
hugh
did
come
for
me
and
jack
came
the
very
night
after
hugh
went
away
and
took
me
for
a
long
ride
he
told
me
how
terribly
jealous
he
had
been
and
how
thankful
he
was
that
hugh
was
out
of
the
way
at
last
and
that
peter
was
going
too
so
i
laughed
and
said
that
peter
did
count
at
all
and
that
i
hated
hugh
of
course
neither
of
those
things
was
true
but
i
was
so
hurt
i
felt
like
to
hurt
somebody
too
and
finally
i
blurted
out
how
mean
hugh
had
been
to
make
me
think
he
cared
for
me
when
he
was
just
having
a
good
time
then
jack
said
care
about
you
just
crazy
over
you
do
believe
you
i
said
never
believe
any
man
again
just
to
tease
him
that
was
all
i
show
you
whether
i
love
you
he
said
and
began
to
kiss
me
i
think
he
had
been
drinking
he
does
you
know
of
course
i
ought
to
have
stopped
him
but
i
had
let
hugh
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
too
the
first
time
but
after
i
found
it
did
mean
anything
to
him
it
did
seem
to
matter
if
some
one
else
kiss
me
i
was
flattered
and
pleased
and
comforted
you
must
think
that
what
happened
afterwards
was
all
jack
fault
i
think
i
could
have
stopped
it
even
then
if
he
been
sober
anyway
but
i
did
guess
i
never
dreamed
how
far
you
could
get
carried
away
and
how
quickly
oh
sylvia
why
did
somebody
tell
me
at
home
in
the
sunshine
with
people
all
around
you
it
like
another
world
like
another
person
than
when
there
nothing
but
stillness
and
darkness
everywhere
and
a
man
who
loves
you
pleading
with
his
arms
around
you
and
afterwards
i
thought
no
one
would
ever
know
jack
thought
so
too
besides
you
see
he
is
crazy
to
marry
me
he
give
anything
to
but
i
would
marry
him
for
anything
in
the
world
whatever
happened
the
great
ignorant
dirty
drunkard
only
he
is
unkind
or
cowardly
think
that
or
let
the
others
think
so
he
willing
to
take
his
share
of
the
blame
he
then
just
a
little
while
ago
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
what
had
happened
but
i
did
know
much
about
that
either
i
thought
some
way
i
might
be
mistaken
i
hoped
so
anyhow
i
wanted
to
come
and
tell
you
all
about
it
but
i
did
dare
i
never
saw
you
kiss
austin
but
once
you
so
quiet
when
you
with
him
sylvia
and
other
people
are
around
and
it
was
it
was
just
like
after
seeing
that
i
come
to
you
with
my
story
unless
to
i
felt
as
if
it
would
be
just
like
throwing
mud
on
a
flower
then
yesterday
after
the
work
was
done
peter
asked
me
to
go
to
walk
with
him
it
was
so
late
when
he
and
austin
got
home
that
i
had
scarcely
seen
him
i
was
going
upstairs
in
the
dark
and
i
did
know
that
he
was
anywhere
near
it
frightened
me
when
he
called
so
so
i
slipped
and
fell
all
the
way
down
i
knew
right
away
that
i
was
hurt
but
of
course
i
did
guess
how
much
i
went
to
walk
with
him
just
the
same
because
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
feel
good
to
be
with
peter
he
always
been
so
well
i
ca
explain
and
while
we
were
out
i
began
to
feel
sick
and
now
of
course
he
never
be
willing
to
take
me
to
walk
to
be
seen
anywhere
with
me
again
i
ca
bear
it
i
mind
not
having
been
square
to
him
more
than
anything
else
more
than
mother
even
oh
sylvia
tell
them
please
and
have
it
over
with
tell
them
too
that
it
was
my
own
fault
do
forget
that
part
and
then
take
me
away
with
you
where
i
wo
see
them
or
any
one
else
i
know
and
teach
me
to
be
good
even
if
you
ca
help
me
to
forget
two
hours
later
when
edith
was
sleeping
again
gray
came
into
the
room
with
a
mute
haggard
expression
on
her
kind
homely
face
which
sylvia
never
forgot
and
put
her
arms
around
the
younger
woman
austin
askin
for
you
dearie
it
been
a
hard
day
for
him
too
i
think
you
ought
to
go
to
him
i
sit
here
until
you
come
back
sylvia
nodded
and
stole
silently
out
of
the
room
austin
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
his
smile
of
welcome
changing
to
an
expression
of
stern
solicitude
as
he
looked
at
her
have
you
been
seeing
ghosts
you
whiter
than
chalk
no
wonder
shut
up
in
that
hot
dark
room
all
day
without
any
rest
and
almost
without
any
food
no
matter
if
edith
does
want
you
most
you
have
to
take
turns
with
mother
after
this
come
out
with
me
where
it
cool
for
a
little
while
and
then
you
must
have
some
supper
and
a
bath
and
sally
room
to
sleep
in
if
you
wo
go
home
which
is
really
the
best
place
for
you
she
allowed
him
to
lead
her
without
saying
a
word
to
the
sheltered
slope
of
the
river
and
sat
down
under
a
great
elm
while
he
flung
himself
down
beside
her
laying
his
head
in
her
lap
sylvia
just
think
less
than
three
weeks
now
it
been
running
through
my
head
all
day
i
almost
got
it
down
to
hours
minutes
and
seconds
what
the
matter
with
edith
anyway
father
and
mother
are
as
dumb
as
posts
the
matter
is
oh
my
darling
boy
i
might
as
well
tell
you
at
once
we
ca
i
got
to
go
away
with
edith
austin
you
must
wait
for
me
another
year
and
her
courage
giving
out
completely
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
sobbed
out
the
tragic
story
chapter
xix
sylvia
i
wo
give
you
up
ca
darling
it
is
giving
me
up
it
only
waiting
a
little
longer
for
me
do
you
think
i
waited
long
enough
already
yes
austin
but
perhaps
i
wo
have
to
stay
away
a
whole
year
perhaps
by
spring
or
we
might
be
married
now
just
as
we
planned
and
take
edith
with
us
no
no
he
cried
you
know
i
would
do
that
i
want
you
all
to
myself
then
still
more
passionately
you
only
yourself
you
sha
darken
your
own
youth
with
this
this
horrible
thing
you
seen
sorrow
and
sin
enough
far
far
too
much
you
a
right
to
be
happy
now
to
live
your
own
life
and
so
have
i
and
has
edith
any
right
no
she
forfeited
hers
do
you
really
think
so
do
you
believe
that
a
young
innocent
sheltered
girl
so
pretty
and
so
magnetic
that
she
attracts
immediate
attention
wherever
she
goes
who
has
starved
for
pretty
things
and
a
good
time
and
suddenly
finds
them
within
her
reach
whose
parents
wilfully
shut
their
eyes
to
the
fact
that
she
growing
up
and
boast
that
kept
everything
from
her
and
then
let
her
go
wherever
she
chooses
with
that
pitiful
lack
of
armor
does
deserve
another
chance
and
i
think
if
you
had
stayed
with
her
through
last
night
and
seen
the
change
that
suffering
and
shame
and
hopelessness
have
wrought
in
that
little
gay
lovely
thoughtless
creature
you
feel
that
she
had
paid
a
pitifully
large
forfeit
already
and
realize
that
no
matter
how
much
we
help
her
she
have
to
go
on
paying
it
as
long
as
she
lives
austin
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
muttered
well
why
does
she
marry
jack
weston
she
admits
that
it
was
half
her
fault
and
that
he
really
does
care
for
her
him
sylvia
cried
he
cares
for
her
as
much
as
it
is
in
him
to
care
for
anybody
but
you
know
perfectly
well
what
he
is
do
you
want
her
to
tie
herself
forever
to
an
ignorant
intemperate
sensual
man
put
herself
where
the
nightmare
of
her
folly
would
stare
her
perpetually
in
the
face
where
he
throw
it
in
her
teeth
every
time
he
was
angry
with
her
that
he
married
her
out
of
charity
and
probably
tell
the
whole
countryside
the
same
thing
the
first
time
he
went
to
wallacetown
on
a
saturday
evening
and
began
to
how
much
chance
for
hope
and
salvation
would
be
left
for
her
then
have
you
forgotten
something
you
said
to
me
once
something
which
wiped
away
in
one
instant
all
the
bitterness
and
agony
of
three
years
and
sent
me
straight
into
your
arms
best
part
of
a
decent
man
love
is
not
passion
but
reverence
his
greatest
desire
not
possession
but
protection
his
ultimate
aim
not
gratification
but
sacrifice
i
did
guess
then
what
a
beautiful
and
wonderful
thing
passion
could
be
i
only
seen
the
other
side
of
it
sylvia
winced
but
she
only
said
very
gently
then
can
you
with
that
knowledge
wish
edith
to
keep
on
seeing
it
all
her
life
it
pretty
dreadful
i
think
remember
i
seen
it
too
good
god
sylvia
do
stop
talking
as
if
the
cases
were
synonymous
were
it
revolting
to
me
to
hear
you
keep
saying
that
you
there
no
more
likeness
between
you
and
edith
than
there
is
between
a
lily
growing
in
a
queen
garden
and
a
rose
springing
up
on
a
dusty
highroad
i
know
how
you
feel
dear
but
remember
the
rose
is
a
they
both
flowers
and
fragrant
and
and
fragile
they
then
very
softly
besides
the
lily
growing
in
the
garden
even
though
the
wicked
king
may
own
it
for
a
time
is
usually
picked
in
the
end
by
the
fairy
prince
to
adorn
his
palace
while
the
little
rose
any
tramp
may
pluck
and
stick
in
his
hat
and
fling
away
when
it
is
faded
and
if
it
was
really
the
property
of
an
honest
woodman
and
his
wife
and
the
highroad
ran
very
close
to
the
border
of
a
sheltered
wood
where
their
cottage
was
would
they
feel
very
badly
when
they
found
their
rose
was
gone
you
plead
very
well
said
austin
almost
roughly
and
you
pleading
for
every
one
for
edith
and
father
and
mother
who
all
done
wrong
and
now
you
want
to
take
the
burden
of
their
wrongdoing
on
your
own
innocent
shoulders
and
make
me
help
you
no
matter
how
suffer
tried
to
do
never
so
hard
in
all
my
life
and
mostly
i
succeeded
you
helped
i
never
could
have
done
it
without
you
but
a
lot
of
it
has
been
pulling
myself
up
by
my
own
bootstraps
now
reached
the
end
of
my
rope
and
i
suppose
instead
of
thinking
of
that
the
next
thing
you
do
will
be
to
make
excuses
for
jack
weston
yes
said
sylvia
very
gently
that
just
what
i
going
to
do
i
know
how
hard
you
tried
i
know
how
well
you
succeeded
i
know
there
are
many
men
like
you
good
as
in
the
whole
world
not
saying
that
because
i
in
love
with
you
i
not
saying
it
to
encourage
you
i
saying
it
because
it
true
you
conquered
all
along
the
line
it
so
wonderful
and
so
glorious
that
sometimes
it
almost
takes
my
breath
away
darling
you
know
i
never
reproached
you
even
in
my
own
mind
for
anything
that
may
have
happened
before
you
knew
me
and
know
that
much
as
you
wish
now
it
never
had
happened
still
you
can
comfort
yourself
with
the
old
platitudes
of
double
standard
men
do
this
some
time
or
nearly
all
men
i
have
been
any
worse
than
lots
of
others
and
i
always
respected
women
oh
i
heard
it
all
hundreds
of
times
some
day
i
hope
you
feel
differently
about
that
too
that
you
wo
teach
son
to
argue
that
way
not
only
because
it
wrong
but
because
dangerous
and
very
much
out
of
date
besides
this
is
the
time
to
go
into
all
that
but
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
willing
to
tell
me
everything
that
went
through
your
mind
for
five
minutes
when
i
came
to
you
the
night
of
the
graduation
ball
and
you
took
me
in
your
arms
the
cry
came
from
the
hidden
depths
of
austin
soul
wrung
with
grief
and
shame
i
thought
you
never
guessed
you
did
how
could
you
go
on
loving
me
so
how
can
you
say
what
you
just
have
about
my
darling
i
never
would
have
let
you
know
that
i
guessed
if
everything
else
i
said
had
failed
that
was
a
reproach
on
loving
you
how
could
i
help
loving
you
a
thousand
times
more
than
ever
when
you
won
the
greatest
fight
of
all
it
no
sin
to
be
tempted
i
glad
you
strong
enough
and
human
enough
for
that
and
i
thankful
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
you
strong
enough
and
enough
to
resist
temptation
but
you
know
even
a
man
like
you
what
a
sorceress
plain
human
nature
can
be
what
chance
has
a
weakling
like
jack
weston
against
her
when
she
leads
him
in
the
same
path
for
all
answer
he
buried
his
face
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
lay
with
it
hidden
while
she
stroked
his
hair
with
soft
and
soothing
fingers
she
knew
that
she
had
wounded
him
to
the
quick
knew
that
this
battle
was
the
hardest
of
all
knew
most
surely
that
it
was
his
last
one
and
that
he
would
win
it
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
to
wait
unable
to
help
him
and
forced
to
bear
alone
the
burden
of
weariness
and
sacrifice
which
was
nearly
crushing
her
should
austin
sense
even
dimly
how
the
sight
of
edith
suffering
through
the
long
sleepless
night
had
brought
back
her
own
by
its
reawakened
memories
of
agony
which
he
had
taught
her
to
forget
should
divine
that
she
too
had
counted
the
days
to
their
marriage
and
rejoiced
that
the
long
waiting
was
over
she
knew
that
edith
cause
would
be
lost
she
counted
on
the
strength
of
the
belief
that
most
men
hold
they
never
guess
how
mistakenly
that
fatigue
and
pain
are
matters
of
slight
importance
among
the
really
big
things
of
life
and
that
women
do
not
feel
as
strongly
as
they
do
that
there
is
less
passion
in
the
giving
than
in
the
taking
that
is
the
greatest
thing
they
ever
know
some
day
she
would
convince
him
that
he
was
wrong
but
now
at
last
he
looked
up
with
an
expression
in
his
eyes
dimly
seen
in
the
starlight
which
brought
fresh
tears
to
hers
but
new
courage
to
her
tired
heart
if
you
do
love
me
and
i
know
you
do
he
said
brokenly
never
speak
to
me
about
that
again
you
forgiven
it
you
forgive
everything
but
i
never
shall
forgive
myself
or
feel
that
i
can
atone
for
what
i
meant
for
that
one
moment
to
do
as
long
as
i
live
on
christmas
night
when
there
was
no
evil
in
my
heart
you
thought
you
saw
it
there
because
your
trust
had
been
betrayed
before
i
vowed
then
that
i
would
teach
you
at
least
that
i
was
worthy
of
your
confidence
and
that
most
men
were
and
when
i
had
taught
you
not
only
to
trust
me
but
to
love
me
so
that
you
saw
no
evil
even
when
it
existed
i
very
nearly
betrayed
you
it
was
my
strength
that
saved
us
it
was
your
wonderful
love
and
faith
there
no
desire
in
the
world
that
would
profane
such
an
altar
of
holiness
as
you
unveiled
before
me
that
night
he
lifted
her
soft
dress
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
skirt
i
have
forgiven
myself
about
what
happened
before
i
knew
you
either
he
whispered
wrong
there
i
used
those
arguments
once
myself
but
i
ca
any
more
we
teach
better
wo
we
so
that
he
have
a
cleaner
heritage
to
offer
his
wife
than
i
got
for
mine
but
he
wo
love
her
any
more
now
darling
go
back
to
the
house

some
rest
if
you

but
before

to

dark

feet

there

be
no
doubt

peter
asked
sylvia
gently
he
came
closer
still
it
was
not
too
dark
as
he
did
so
to
see
the
furrows
which
fresh
tears
had
made
on
his
grimy
face
to
be
conscious
of
his
soiled
and
stained
working
clothes
and
his
clumsiness
of
manner
and
carriage
but
the
earnest
voice
went
on
more
doggedly

found

he

beyond
speech

sylvia

more
question

her
any
more
she
said
that
you
wo

be
willing

out

she

replied
peter
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
chapter
xx
well
i
declare
it
so
sudden
like
i
should
think
your
breath
would
be
took
away
gray
smiled
at
elliott
and
went
on
with
her
sewing
rocking
back
and
forth
placidly
in
her
favorite
chair
if
the
latter
had
been
a
woman
who
talked
less
and
observed
more
she
would
have
noticed
how
drawn
and
furrowed
her
old
friend
rosy
peaceful
face
had
grown
how
much
repression
there
was
about
the
lips
which
smiled
so
bravely
but
these
details
escaped
her
it
does
look
that
way
to
an
outsider
said
gray
slowly
as
if
rehearsing
a
part
which
had
been
carefully
taught
her
but
when
you
come
to
know
the
facts
it
ai
so
strange
after
all
would
you
feel
to
tell
them
asked
elliott
eagerly
why
sure
edith
an
peter
been
sort
of
engaged
this
long
time
back
but
they
was
so
young
we
urged
to
wait
then
peter
father
wrote
sayin
he
was
so
poorly
he
wished
peter
could
fix
it
so
to
come
home
through
the
cold
weather
an
edith
took
on
terrible
at
bein
separated
from
him
an
peter
declared
he
would
leave
without
her
then
well
sylvia
sided
with
an
that
settled
it
elliott
nodded
you
never
think
that
little
creature
could
be
so
set
an
determined
now
would
you
she
asked
i
never
see
any
one
to
beat
her
an
mum
she
shuts
her
mouth
a
steel
trap
if
any
family
ever
had
a
livin
blessin
showered
on
right
out
of
heaven
said
gray
we
did
the
day
sylvia
come
here
funny
austin
the
only
one
of
us
can
see
she
got
a
single
fault
he
says
she
got
lots
of
just
like
any
other
woman
but
i
bet
he
cut
the
tongue
out
of
any
one
else
who
said
so
seems
as
if
i
could
wait
for
the
third
of
september
to
come
so
she
really
be
my
daughter
though
i
have
got
one
that
seems
any
dearer
to
me
even
now
speakin
of
weddin
said
elliott
why
did
you
have
a
regular
one
for
edith
same
as
for
sally
land
i
ca
spend
my
whole
time
workin
up
weddin
seems
like
they
was
some
kind
of
contagious
disease
in
this
family
james
was
married
only
last
december
an
even
if
we
was
to
that
we
got
all
het
up
over
it
just
the
same
an
now
we
hardly
got
our
breath
since
sally
austin
is
starin
us
in
the
face
i
could
see
my
way
clear
to
this
whole
great
ark
in
for
nobody
an
edith
an
peter
got
to
leave
the
very
day
after
sylvia
austin
get
married
peter
was
hangin
round
outside
edith
door
the
whole
blessed
time
after
her
fall
strange
she
should
be
so
sick
just
from
a
fall
ai
it
yes
is
but
the
doctor
says
they
often
more
serious
than
think
for
well
as
i
was
sayin
sylvia
come
out
of
edith
room
found
peter
settin
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
for
the
third
time
that
day
an
she
flared
right
up
an
says
heaven
sake
why
do
you
get
married
right
off
now
then
you
can
go
in
an
out
as
you
like
and
before
we
half
knew
what
she
was
up
to
she
had
telephoned
the
new
minister
austin
said
he
wished
she
shown
more
of
that
haste
about
gettin
married
herself
an
she
answered
him
right
back
if
she
been
lucky
enough
to
get
as
good
a
feller
as
peter
maybe
she
might
have
real
fun
to
hear
tease
each
other
sylvia
likes
the
new
minister
she
says
the
best
thing
about
the
methodist
church
that
she
knows
of
is
the
way
it
shifts
its
pastors
around
nothin
like
variety
she
says
an
a
new
one
once
in
three
years
keeps
things
hummin
she
says
as
long
as
so
many
methodists
do
believe
in
cards
an
dancin
an
such
they
deserve
to
have
a
little
fun
some
way
an
you
was
talkin
about
edith
interrupted
elliott
rather
tartly
you
got
kinder
switched
off
excuse
me
eliza
so
i
have
well
sylvia
got
edith
up
onto
the
couch
the
doctor
had
said
she
might
get
up
for
a
little
while
that
day
anyhow
an
give
her
one
of
her
prettiest
wrappers
what
color
white
no
sylvia
thought
she
was
too
pale
it
was
a
lovely
yellow
like
the
dress
she
wore
to
the
graduation
ball
we
all
scurried
an
changed
our
clothes
austin
the
most
thing
in
that
white
flannel
suit
of
his
sylvia
wants
he
should
wear
it
to
his
own
weddin
of
a
an
i
wore
my
gray
well
it
was
all
over
before
you
could
say
robinson
an
i
never
sweat
a
drop
gettin
ready
for
it
either
i
shall
miss
edith
somethin
terrible
this
winter
but
have
an
elegant
trip
same
as
she
always
wanted
to
an
peter
says
he
knows
his
parents
be
tickled
to
death
to
have
such
a
pretty
do
you
feel
disappointed
any
elliott
could
not
help
asking
to
have
a
feller
like
peter
in
the
family
gray
bit
her
thread
i
do
know
what
you
got
against
peter
she
said
i
look
to
like
him
the
best
of
my
so
far
but
that
evening
as
she
sat
with
her
husband
beside
the
old
which
all
the
electricity
that
sylvia
had
installed
had
not
caused
them
to
give
up
her
courage
deserted
her
howard
sensing
that
something
was
wrong
looked
up
from
hoard
dairyman
which
he
was
eagerly
devouring
to
see
that
the
had
slipped
to
her
knees
and
that
she
sat
staring
straight
ahead
of
her
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
why
mary
he
said
in
amazement
mary
the
new
englander
is
as
unemotional
as
he
is
undemonstrative
for
a
moment
howard
always
slow
of
speech
and
action
was
too
nonplussed
to
know
what
to
do
deeply
sorry
as
he
felt
for
his
wife
then
he
leaned
over
and
patted
her
hand
the
hand
that
was
scarcely
less
rough
and
scarred
than
his
own
with
his
big
calloused
one
you
must
stop
grieving
over
edith
he
said
gently
and
blaming
yourself
for
what
happened
you
been
a
wonderful
mother
there
are
many
like
you
in
the
world
think
how
well
the
other
seven
children
are
coming
along
instead
of
how
the
eighth
slipped
up
think
how
blessed
we
been
never
to
lose
a
single
one
of
them
by
death
think
i
do
think
howard
gray
pressed
his
hand
in
return
smiling
bravely
through
her
tears
i
an
old
fool
to
give
way
like
this
an
a
worse
one
to
let
you
catch
me
at
it
but
it
ai
wholly
edith
cryin
about
land
every
time
i
start
to
curse
the
devil
for
jack
weston
i
get
interrupted
because
i
have
to
stop
an
thank
the
lord
for
peter
an
all
the
angels
in
heaven
together
singin
halleluia
led
by
gabriel
for
could
half
express
my
feelin
for
sylvia
i
guess
always
be
that
way
if
we
stop
to
think
our
blessin
is
so
much
thicker
than
our
troubles
that
the
troubles
do
show
up
no
more
than
a
little
yellow
mustard
growin
up
in
a
fine
piece
of
oats
unless
we
bound
to
look
at
the
mustard
instead
of
the
oats
as
it
happens
i
was
thinkin
of
edith
at
all
at
that
moment
or
really
grievin
either
it
was
just
yes
asked
howard
this
room
said
gray
gulping
a
little
is
about
the
only
one
in
the
house
that
ai
changed
a
mite
the
others
are
improved
wonderful
but
i
kinder
glad
we
kept
this
just
as
it
was
the
braided
rugs
on
the
floor
that
i
made
when
you
was
courtin
me
howard
an
we
used
to
set
out
on
the
doorstep
together
an
the
fringed
tidies
over
the
chairs
an
sofa
that
eliza
give
me
for
a
present
they
faded
considerable
but
that
good
red
wool
never
wears
out
there
the
crayon
portraits
we
had
done
when
we
was
on
our
honeymoon
an
the
ones
of
james
an
sally
when
they
was
babies
do
you
remember
how
i
took
it
to
heart
because
we
could
scrape
together
the
money
no
way
to
get
one
of
austin
when
he
come
along
he
was
the
prettiest
baby
we
ever
had
too
except
except
edith
of
course
after
austin
we
did
even
bring
up
the
subject
again
we
was
pretty
well
occupied
wonderin
how
we
was
goin
to
feed
an
clothe
all
let
alone
havin
pictures
of
then
there
the
wax
flowers
on
the
mantelpiece
i
always
trembled
for
fear
one
of
the
youngsters
would
knock
off
an
break
the
glass
shade
to
smithereens
but
they
never
did
there
your
grandfather
gray
clock
i
was
a
little
disappointed
at
first
because
it
had
a
brass
face
o
bein
white
with
scenes
on
it
like
they
usually
was
an
then
it
was
such
a
chore
with
everything
else
there
was
to
do
to
keep
it
shinin
like
it
ought
to
but
now
i
think
i
like
it
better
than
the
other
kind
an
it
tickin
away
same
as
it
has
this
last
hundred
years
an
more
do
you
remember
when
we
began
to
wind
it
up
saturday
nights
all
this
is
the
same
praise
be
but
yes
asked
howard
gray
again
for
years
evenin
went
on
gray
this
room
was
full
of
kids
there
was
generally
a
baby
sleepin
or
refusin
rather
loud
to
sleep
in
the
cradle
over
in
the
corner
the
older
ones
was
around
doin
sums
on
their
slates
or
playin
checkers
an
they
quarrelled
considerable
an
they
was
pretty
shabby
an
i
never
had
a
chance
to
set
down
an
read
the
after
supper
because
the
was
always
waitin
for
me
piled
right
up
to
the
brim
saturday
nights
what
a
job
it
was
all
winter
to
get
enough
water
het
to
fill
the
over
an
over
again
an
fetch
in
front
of
the
often
i
was
tempted
to
wash
two
or
three
of
in
the
same
water
but
as
you
know
i
never
done
it
thank
goodness
we
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
takin
a
bath
every
day
then
i
do
deny
a
comfort
with
all
the
elegant
plumbin
we
got
now
not
to
feel
you
got
to
wait
for
a
certain
day
to
come
to
take
a
good
soak
when
you
hot
or
dirty
but
it
would
have
been
an
awful
strain
on
my
conscience
an
my
back
both
in
them
days
i
used
to
think
sometimes
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
this
pack
of
unruly
youngsters
is
grown
up
out
of
the
way
an
howard
an
i
can
have
a
little
peace
an
now
that
time
come
an
i
set
here
feelin
lonely
an
thinkin
the
old
room
the
same
in
spite
of
the
fact
as
i
said
before
that
it
changed
a
mite
because
we
have
got
the
whole
eight
tumblin
under
our
heels
i
know
they
doin
well
they
doin
most
well
i
scared
the
time
comin
when
they
look
down
on
us
howard
me
especially
not
that
they
mean
to
but
they
all
gettin
so
so
different
you
had
a
good
education
an
talk
right
but
i
ca
even
do
that
i
found
an
old
grammar
the
other
day
an
set
down
an
tried
to
learn
somethin
out
of
it
but
it
war
no
use
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
an
then
they
all
away
an
they
goin
to
keep
on
away
james
is
south
an
thomas
is
at
college
an
molly
music
in
boston
an
before
we
know
it
katherine
be
at
college
too
an
edith
an
austin
in
europe
that
leaves
just
ruth
an
sally
near
us
an
they
both
married
i
do
begrudge
it
to
one
bit
i
glad
an
thankful
they
all
havin
a
better
chance
than
we
did
if
i
could
just
feel
that
some
day
they
all
come
back
to
the
homestead
an
to
us
an
come
because
they
to
howard
put
his
arm
around
his
wife
and
drew
her
down
beside
him
on
the
old
horsehair
sofa
one
of
the
precious
red
wool
tidies
slipped
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
unnoticed
slowly
while
gray
had
been
talking
the
full
depth
of
her
trouble
became
clear
to
him
and
the
words
to
comfort
her
rose
to
his
lips
they
will
mary
he
said
they
will
you
wait
and
see
how
could
you
think
for
one
moment
that
our
children
could
look
down
on
their
mother
it
mighty
seldom
let
me
tell
you
that
any
boy
or
girl
does
that
and
only
with
pretty
good
reason
then
never
when
they
been
blessed
with
one
like
you
i
have
been
able
to
do
what
i
wanted
for
ours
but
at
least
i
gave
them
the
best
thing
they
possibly
could
have
a
good
mother
and
with
that
i
do
think
the
hardships
have
hurt
them
much
have
you
forgotten
you
must
think
i
sacrilegious
dear
that
the
greatest
mother
we
know
anything
about
was
just
a
poor
wife
and
how
much
her
great
son
loved
her
her
name
was
mary
too
glad
we
gave
molly
that
name
she
a
good
girl
somehow
it
seems
to
me
it
always
carries
a
halo
of
sacredness
with
it
even
now
then
besides
thomas
and
austin
are
both
going
to
be
farmers
and
live
right
here
on
the
old
place
austin
so
smart
he
may
do
other
things
besides
but
this
will
always
be
his
home
and
sylvia
peter
and
edith
be
here
too
and
sally
and
ruth
are
more
than
a
off
as
you
might
say
that
makes
four
out
of
the
eight
more
than
most
parents
get
the
others
will
come
back
fast
enough
to
visit
with
us
and
them
here
and
think
of
the
grandchildren
coming
along
why
in
the
next
generation
there
be
more
kids
piling
in
and
out
of
this
than
you
could
lug
water
and
mend
socks
for
if
you
never
turned
your
hand
to
another
thing
and
thank
god
you
wo
have
to
do
that
now
you
can
just
sit
back
and
take
solid
comfort
with
them
you
had
to
work
so
hard
when
our
own
children
were
babies
mary
that
you
never
could
do
that
but
with
ruth
and
austin
and
sally
he
paused
smiling
as
he
looked
into
the
future
then
he
kissed
her
almost
as
shyly
as
he
had
first
done
more
than
thirty
years
before
besides
he
said
i
disappointed
if
you
lonely
here
with
me
just
for
a
little
while
because
i
enjoying
it
a
whole
lot
have
you
ever
noticed
that
when
two
people
that
love
each
other
first
get
married
there
a
kind
of
to
their
happiness
like
the
glow
of
a
sunrise
it
mighty
beautiful
and
splendid
then
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
as
the
bible
says
comes
along
it
does
mean
that
they
do
care
for
each
other
any
more
but
they
so
tired
and
so
pressed
and
so
worried
that
they
do
say
much
about
their
feelings
and
sometimes
they
even
avoid
talking
to
each
other
or
quarrel
but
when
the
hard
hours
are
over
and
the
sun
gone
down
not
so
bright
as
it
was
in
the
morning
maybe
but
softer
and
spreading
its
color
over
the
whole
sky
the
stars
come
out
and
they
know
the
best
part
of
the
day
ahead
of
them
still
they
can
take
time
then
to
sit
down
and
take
each
other
hands
and
thank
god
for
all
his
blessings
but
most
of
all
for
the
life
of
a
man
and
a
woman
together
austin
and
sylvia
think
they
going
to
have
the
best
part
now
in
the
little
brick
cottage
but
they
not
they
be
having
it
thirty
years
from
now
just
as
you
and
i
are
in
the
old
gray
homestead
mary
gray
wiped
her
eyes
why
howard
she
said
you
used
to
say
you
wanted
to
be
a
poet
but
i
never
knew
till
now
that
you
one
rather
you
ha
said
all
that
to
me
than
than
to
have
been
married
to
shakespeare
she
ended
with
a
happy
sob
and
put
her
white
head
down
on
his
shoulder
chapter
xxi
uncle
mat
whose
visit
was
at
last
taking
place
sat
talking
in
front
of
the
fire
in
sylvia
with
the
new
minister
the
room
was
bright
with
many
candles
and
early
fall
flowers
from
her
own
garden
stood
about
in
clear
glass
vases
in
the
beyond
they
could
see
the
two
servants
moving
around
the
table
laid
for
supper
a
man
voice
whistling
and
the
sound
of
rapidly
approaching
footsteps
came
up
the
footpath
from
the
homestead
and
at
the
same
moment
the
door
of
sylvia
own
room
opened
and
shut
and
there
was
the
rustle
of
silk
and
the
scent
of
roses
in
the
hall
a
moment
later
she
came
in
her
arm
on
austin
her
neck
and
arms
were
bare
as
he
loved
to
see
them
and
her
white
silk
dress
brocaded
in
tiny
pink
rosebuds
swept
soft
and
full
about
her
a
single
string
of
great
pearls
fell
over
the
lace
on
her
breast
and
almost
down
to
her
waist
and
there
was
a
high
jewelled
comb
in
her
hair
she
leaned
over
her
uncle
chair
austin
says
the
others
are
on
their
way
am
i
all
right
do
you
think
uncle
mat
you
look
to
me
as
if
you
had
stepped
out
of
an
old
french
painting
he
said
pinching
her
rosy
cheek
i
satisfied
with
you
but
the
question
arises
is
austin
he
so
fussy
austin
laughed
straightening
his
tie
i
ca
fuss
about
this
dress
he
said
for
i
chose
it
myself
but
i
not
half
the
tyrant
you
all
make
me
out
i
wearing
white
flannel
to
please
her
is
there
plenty
of
supper
sylvia
i
almost
starved
i
know
enough
to
expect
a
man
to
be
hungry
even
if
he
going
to
be
hanged
or
married
she
retorted
but
i
run
out
to
the
kitchen
once
more
just
to
make
sure
that
everything
is
all
right
the
third
of
september
had
come
at
last
there
was
no
question
this
time
of
a
wedding
in
bartholomew
church
with
twelve
bridesmaids
and
a
breakfast
at
sherry
no
wonderful
jewels
no
press
notices
almost
no
trousseau
austin
family
uncle
mat
and
a
few
close
friends
came
to
sylvia
own
little
house
and
when
the
small
circle
was
complete
she
took
her
uncle
arm
and
stood
by
austin
side
while
the
new
minister
married
them
thomas
was
best
man
molly
for
the
second
time
that
summer
sadie
and
james
were
missing
but
as
a
wedding
present
came
a
telegram
announcing
the
safe
arrival
of
a
edith
was
not
there
either
and
the
date
of
sailing
for
holland
had
been
postponed
she
had
gained
less
rapidly
than
they
had
hoped
and
still
lay
very
pale
and
quiet
on
the
sofa
between
the
big
windows
in
her
room
but
she
was
not
left
alone
when
the
rest
of
the
family
departed
for
sylvia
house
for
peter
sat
beside
her
in
the
twilight
his
big
rough
fingers
clasping
her
thin
white
ones
there
proved
to
be
plenty
of
supper
and
soon
after
it
was
finished
the
guests
began
to
leave
uncle
mat
with
many
imprecations
at
sylvia
lack
of
hospitality
in
turning
them
out
such
a
cold
night
even
the
two
capable
servants
having
removed
all
traces
of
the
feast
came
to
her
with
many
expressions
of
and
the
assurance
of
comin
back
next
season
if
they
was
wanted
and
departed
to
take
the
night
train
from
wallacetown
for
new
york
by
ten
the
front
door
with
its
brass
knocker
had
opened
and
shut
for
the
last
time
and
austin
bolted
it
and
turned
to
sylvia
smiling
well
he
said
you
locked
in
now
far
from
all
the
sights
and
sounds
that
made
your
youth
happy
and
hotel
the
slamming
of
limousine
doors
and
the
clinking
of
ice
in
your
last
chance
of
escape
is
gone
you
signed
and
sealed
your
own
austin
do
joke
my
dear
he
asked
lifting
her
face
in
his
hands
did
you
never
joke
because
you
were
afraid
to
show
how
much
you
really
felt
yes
she
replied
very
often
but
there
nothing
in
the
whole
world
for
me
to
be
afraid
of
now
so
you
really
ready
for
me
at
last
he
whispered
whatever
she
answered
or
even
if
she
did
not
answer
at
all
to
all
appearances
austin
was
satisfied
his
mother
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
three
days
later
was
almost
startled
at
the
radiance
in
his
face
it
was
perhaps
a
strange
honeymoon
but
those
who
thought
so
had
felt
and
rightly
that
it
was
a
strange
marriage
after
the
first
few
days
austin
spent
every
day
at
the
farm
as
usual
walking
back
to
the
little
brick
cottage
for
his
noonday
dinner
and
leaving
after
the
milking
was
done
at
night
and
sylvia
dressed
in
blue
gingham
cooked
and
cleaned
and
sewed
and
put
her
garden
in
shape
for
the
winter
in
spite
of
her
year
training
at
gray
capable
hands
she
made
mistakes
she
burnt
the
grape
jelly
and
forgot
to
put
the
brown
sugar
into
the
sweet
pickle
and
took
the
varnish
off
the
table
by
polishing
it
with
raw
linseed
oil
and
boiled
the
color
out
of
her
sheerest
chiffon
blouse
and
they
laughed
together
over
her
blunders
then
when
evening
came
she
was
all
in
white
again
and
there
was
the
simple
supper
served
by
in
the
little
and
the
quiet
hours
in
front
of
the
glowing
fire
afterwards
and
the
long
still
nights
with
the
soft
stars
shining
in
and
the
cool
air
blowing
through
the
open
windows
of
their
room
then
when
the
old
gray
homestead
had
settled
down
to
the
blessed
peacefulness
and
security
which
the
harvest
safely
in
the
snows
still
a
long
way
off
comes
to
every
new
england
farm
in
the
late
fall
they
closed
their
front
door
behind
them
and
sailed
away
together
as
austin
had
wished
to
do
there
were
a
few
gay
weeks
in
london
and
paris
the
hague
and
rome
enough
wrote
sylvia
so
that
we
wo
forget
there
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
use
the
wrong
fork
when
we
go
out
to
dine
there
was
a
fortnight
at
the
little
dutch
house
where
by
this
time
peter
and
edith
were
spending
the
winter
with
parents
where
our
bed
wrote
sylvia
was
a
great
big
box
built
into
the
wall
but
oh
so
soft
and
comfortable
with
another
box
for
the
very
best
cow
just
around
the
corner
from
it
and
the
music
of
mother
for
our
morning
hymn
and
then
there
were
several
months
of
wandering
without
undue
haste
but
otherwise
just
like
any
other
tourists
wrote
sylvia
they
went
leisurely
from
place
to
place
as
the
weather
dictated
and
their
own
inclinations
advised
part
of
the
time
edith
and
peter
were
with
them
but
even
then
they
were
nearly
always
alone
for
edith
was
not
strong
enough
to
keep
up
even
with
their
moderate
pace
they
revisited
places
dear
to
both
of
them
they
sought
out
many
new
ones
early
spring
found
them
in
paris
and
it
was
here
that
there
finally
came
an
evening
when
austin
put
his
arms
around
his
wife
shoulders
they
had
made
a
longer
day
of
than
usual
and
she
looked
pale
and
tired
as
having
finished
dressing
earlier
than
he
she
sat
in
the
window
looking
down
at
the
brilliant
street
beneath
them
waiting
for
him
to
take
her
down
to
dinner
and
spoke
in
the
unmistakably
firm
tone
that
he
so
seldom
used
it
time
you
were
at
home
sylvia
we
overstaying
our
holiday
make
sailing
arrangements
so
by
the
end
of
may
they
were
back
in
the
little
brick
cottage
again
and
the
two
capable
servants
were
there
too
for
there
must
be
no
danger
now
of
sylvia
getting
those
were
days
when
austin
seldom
left
his
wife
for
long
if
he
could
help
it
found
it
hard
indeed
not
to
watch
her
constantly
and
to
keep
the
expression
of
anxiety
and
dread
from
his
eyes
he
had
not
proved
to
be
among
those
men
who
as
some
french
cynic
more
clever
than
wise
has
expressed
it
find
the
chase
the
best
part
of
the
game
his
engagement
had
been
a
period
containing
much
joy
it
is
true
but
also
much
doubt
much
and
repression
his
marriage
had
not
held
one
imperfect
hour
sylvia
as
his
wife
with
all
the
petty
barriers
which
social
inequality
and
money
and
restraint
had
reared
between
them
broken
down
by
the
very
weight
of
their
love
was
a
being
even
much
more
desired
and
hallowed
than
the
pale
unattainable
lady
of
his
first
worship
had
been
that
sylvia
should
suffer
because
of
him
was
horrible
that
he
might
possibly
lose
her
altogether
was
a
fear
which
grew
as
the
days
went
on
it
fell
to
her
to
dispel
that
as
she
had
so
many
others
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
she
asked
very
quietly
as
according
to
their
old
custom
they
sat
by
the
riverbank
watching
the
sun
go
down
i
do
mean
to
but
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
i
could
bear
all
this
that
coming
nothing
on
earth
can
be
worth
it
you
do
know
said
sylvia
softly
you
wo
feel
that
way
after
you
seen
him
you
know
then
that
whatever
price
we
pay
our
life
would
have
been
complete
without
this
i
ca
understand
why
men
should
have
all
the
pleasure
and
women
all
the
pain
my
darling
boy
they
do
that
only
an
old
false
theory
that
exploded
years
ago
along
with
the
one
about
everlasting
damnation
and
several
other
abominable
ones
of
like
ilk
do
you
honestly
believe
if
you
will
think
sanely
for
a
moment
that
you
have
had
more
joy
than
i
or
that
you
are
not
suffering
twice
as
much
as
i
am
or
ever
shall
you
say
all
that
to
comfort
me
because
you
twice
as
brave
as
i
am
i
say
it
to
make
you
realize
the
truth
because
i
honest
molly
and
katherine
were
busy
at
the
homestead
in
those
days
sally
and
ruth
in
their
own
little
houses
but
edith
was
at
the
brick
cottage
a
great
deal
in
spite
of
all
peter
loving
care
and
the
treatment
of
a
great
doctor
whom
sylvia
had
insisted
she
should
see
in
london
she
was
not
very
strong
and
found
that
she
must
still
let
the
long
days
slip
by
quietly
while
the
white
hands
that
had
once
been
so
plump
and
brown
grew
steadily
whiter
and
slimmer
she
came
upon
sylvia
one
sultry
afternoon
folding
and
sorting
little
clothes
arranging
them
in
neat
tiny
piles
in
the
scented
drawers
of
a
new
bureau
and
after
she
had
helped
her
put
them
all
in
order
with
hardly
a
word
she
leaned
her
head
against
sylvia
and
whispered
i
do
wish
there
were
some
for
me
i
know
dear
but
you
very
young
yet
many
wives
are
glad
when
this
does
happen
right
away
sally
is
i
know
but
you
see
i
feel
that
perhaps
there
never
will
be
any
for
me
and
that
seems
really
only
fair
does
it
sylvia
was
silent
her
sympathy
would
not
allow
her
to
tell
all
the
london
doctor
had
said
to
her
about
her
young
neither
would
it
allow
her
to
be
untruthful
but
certain
phrases
he
had
used
came
back
to
her
with
tragic
intensity
many
a
woman
who
can
recuperate
almost
miraculously
from
organic
disease
fails
to
rally
from
shock
we
been
overlooking
that
too
long
every
sleepless
night
undoes
the
good
that
the
sunshine
during
the
daytime
has
wrought
and
after
many
sleepless
nights
the
days
become
simply
horrible
preludes
to
more
terrors
i
ca
drug
a
child
like
that
to
a
long
life
of
uselessness
make
her
as
happy
as
you
can
but
let
her
have
it
over
with
as
quickly
as
nature
will
allow
it
or
take
her
to
some
other
man
i
ca
in
charity
to
her
tell
you
anything
else
so
sylvia
and
peter
made
her
as
happy
as
they
could
and
that
they
hoped
at
times
was
very
happy
indeed
but
the
look
of
dread
never
left
her
eyes
for
long
and
the
tired
smile
which
had
replaced
her
ringing
laugh
came
less
and
less
often
to
her
pale
lips
there
was
another
faithful
visitor
at
the
brick
cottage
that
summer
for
after
the
end
of
june
thomas
who
came
home
from
college
at
that
time
seemed
to
be
on
hand
a
good
deal
he
as
well
as
austin
had
proved
false
to
uncle
mat
prophecy
for
far
from
falling
in
love
with
another
girl
within
a
year
he
showed
not
the
slightest
indication
of
doing
so
but
seemed
to
find
perfect
satisfaction
in
the
society
of
his
own
family
especially
that
portion
of
it
in
which
sylvia
was
for
the
moment
to
be
found
austin
at
first
marvelled
at
the
ease
with
which
he
had
accepted
her
for
a
sister
but
the
boy
perfect
transparency
of
behavior
made
it
impossible
to
feel
that
the
new
and
totally
different
affection
which
he
now
felt
for
her
was
a
pose
gradually
he
grew
to
depend
on
thomas
to
look
after
sylvia
when
for
one
reason
or
another
he
was
called
away
his
interests
at
the
bank
took
him
more
and
more
frequently
to
wallacetown
there
were
cattle
auctions
too
important
to
neglect
a
day
journey
from
home
there
was
even
a
tiny
opening
beginning
to
loom
up
on
the
political
horizon
austin
was
too
bound
by
every
tie
of
blood
and
affection
to
the
homestead
ever
to
build
his
permanently
elsewhere
but
he
was
also
rapidly
growing
too
big
to
be
confined
by
it
to
the
exclusion
of
the
new
opportunities
which
seemed
to
be
offering
themselves
to
him
in
such
rapid
succession
in
every
direction
coming
in
very
late
one
evening
in
august
after
one
of
these
necessary
absences
he
found
sylvia
already
in
bed
their
room
dark
she
had
never
failed
to
wait
up
for
him
before
he
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
anxiety
and
contrition
are
you
ill
darling
i
did
mean
to
be
so
late
no
not
ill
just
a
little
more
tired
than
usual
she
drew
his
head
down
to
her
breast
and
for
some
minutes
they
held
each
other
so
silently
their
hearts
beating
together
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
sent
for
the
doctor
now
i
did
want
to
until
you
came
home
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
walked
over
to
the
open
window
his
arm
still
around
her
the
river
shone
like
a
ribbon
of
silver
in
the
moonlight
the
green
meadows
lay
in
soft
shadows
for
miles
around
it
in
the
distance
the
homestead
stood
silhouetted
against
the
starlit
sky
what
a
year
it
been
she
whispered
for
you
and
me
alone
together
and
how
many
years
there
are
before
us
and
our
children
and
the
homestead
and
all
that
we
stand
for
as
long
as
the
new
england
farms
and
the
great
glorious
spirit
which
watches
over
them
shall
endure
a
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
dimming
its
brightness
it
brought
them
to
the
realization
that
the
long
hard
hours
of
the
night
were
before
them
both
to
be
faced
and
conquered
the
new
york
doctor
whom
sylvia
had
once
before
refused
to
send
for
and
the
rosy
nurse
who
had
both
been
staying
at
the
brick
cottage
for
the
last
few
days
were
called
the
servants
roused
to
activity
there
came
a
time
when
austin
impotent
to
serve
sylvia
marvelling
at
her
bravery
wrung
by
her
suffering
felt
that
such
agony
was
beyond
endurance
beyond
hope
beyond
anything
in
life
worth
gaining
but
when
the
breathless
horrible
night
had
dragged
its
interminable
black
length
up
to
the
skirts
of
the
radiant
dawn
the
mist
rose
slowly
from
the
quiet
river
and
still
more
quiet
mountains
the
first
singing
of
the
birds
broke
the
heavy
stillness
and
austin
and
sylvia
kissed
each
other
and
their
son
in
the
glory
of
the
golden
morning
the
end
