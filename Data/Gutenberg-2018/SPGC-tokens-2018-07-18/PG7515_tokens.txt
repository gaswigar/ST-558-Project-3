as
we
see

how
this
book
was
written
in
my
book
father
of
a
i
have
already
stated
the
conditions
under
which
this
book
of
my
son
was
produced
he
was
wounded
in
the
end
of
june
in
the
fierce
struggle
before
lens
he
was
at
once
removed
to
a
and
later
on
to
a
military
hospital
in
london
there
was
grave
danger
of
amputation
of
the
right
arm
but
this
was
happily
avoided
as
soon
as
he
could
use
his
hand
he
was
commandeered
by
the
lord
high
commissioner
of
canada
to
write
an
important
paper
detailing
the
history
of
the
canadian
forces
in
france
and
flanders
this
task
kept
him
busy
until
the
end
of
august
when
he
obtained
a
leave
of
two
months
to
come
home
he
arrived
in
new
york
in
september
and
returned
again
to
london
in
the
end
of
october
the
plan
of
the
book
grew
out
of
his
conversations
with
us
and
the
three
public
addresses
which
he
made
the
idea
had
already
been
suggested
to
him
by
his
london
publisher
john
lane
he
had
written
a
few
hundred
words
but
had
no
very
keen
sense
of
the
value
of
the
experiences
he
had
been
invited
to
relate
he
had
not
even
read
his
own
published
letters
in
he
said
he
had
begun
to
read
them
when
the
book
reached
him
in
the
trenches
but
they
made
him
homesick
and
he
was
also
afraid
that
his
own
estimate
of
their
value
might
not
coincide
with
ours
or
with
the
verdict
which
the
public
has
since
passed
upon
them
he
regarded
his
own
experiences
which
we
found
so
thrilling
in
the
same
spirit
of
modest
depreciation
they
were
the
commonplaces
of
the
life
which
he
had
led
and
he
was
sensitive
lest
they
should
be
regarded
as
improperly
heroic
no
one
was
more
astonished
than
he
when
he
found
great
throngs
eager
to
hear
him
speak
the
people
assembled
an
hour
before
the
advertised
time
they
stormed
the
building
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
open
and
when
every
inch
of
room
was
packed
they
found
a
way
in
by
the
windows
and
a
this
public
appreciation
of
his
message
indicated
a
value
in
it
which
he
had
not
suspected
and
led
him
to
recognise
that
what
he
had
to
say
was
worthy
of
more
than
a
fugitive
utterance
on
a
public
platform
he
at
once
took
up
the
task
of
writing
this
book
with
a
genuine
and
delighted
surprise
that
he
had
not
lost
his
love
of
authorship
he
had
but
a
month
to
devote
to
it
but
by
dint
of
daily
diligence
amid
many
interruptions
of
a
social
nature
he
finished
his
task
before
he
left
the
concluding
lines
were
actually
written
on
the
last
night
before
he
sailed
for
england
we
discussed
several
titles
for
the
book
religion
of
was
the
title
suggested
by
john
lane
but
this
appeared
too
didactic
and
restrictive
i
suggested
in
but
this
admirable
title
had
already
been
appropriated
lastly
we
decided
on
glory
of
the
as
the
most
expressive
of
his
aim
he
felt
that
a
great
deal
too
much
had
been
said
about
the
squalor
filth
discomfort
and
suffering
of
the
trenches
he
pointed
out
that
a
very
popular
which
we
were
then
reading
had
six
paragraphs
in
the
first
sixty
pages
which
described
in
unpleasant
detail
the
verminous
condition
of
the
men
as
if
this
were
the
chief
thing
to
be
remarked
concerning
them
he
held
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
a
writer
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
horrors
of
war
the
effect
was
bad
physiologically
it
frightened
the
parents
of
soldiers
it
was
equally
bad
for
the
enlisted
man
himself
for
it
created
a
false
impression
in
his
mind
we
all
knew
that
war
was
horrible
but
as
a
rule
the
soldier
thought
little
of
this
feature
in
his
lot
it
bulked
large
to
the
civilian
who
resented
inconvenience
and
discomfort
because
he
had
only
known
their
opposites
but
the
soldier
real
thoughts
were
concerned
with
other
things
he
was
engaged
in
spiritual
acts
he
was
accomplishing
spiritual
purposes
as
truly
as
the
martyr
of
faith
and
religion
he
was
moved
by
spiritual
impulses
the
evocation
of
duty
the
loyal
dependence
of
comradeship
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
the
complete
surrender
of
the
body
to
the
will
of
the
soul
this
was
the
side
of
war
which
men
needed
most
to
recognise
they
needed
it
not
only
because
it
was
the
true
side
but
because
nothing
else
could
kindle
and
sustain
the
enduring
flame
of
heroism
in
men
hearts
while
some
erred
in
exhibiting
nothing
but
the
brutalities
of
war
others
erred
by
sentimentalising
war
he
admitted
that
it
was
perfectly
possible
to
paint
a
portrait
of
a
soldier
with
the
aureole
of
a
saint
but
it
would
not
be
a
representative
portrait
it
would
be
eclectic
the
result
of
selection
elimination
it
would
be
as
unlike
the
common
average
as
rupert
brooke
with
his
poet
face
and
heart
was
unlike
the
ordinary
naval
officers
with
whom
he
sailed
to
the
aegean
the
ordinary
soldier
is
an
intensely
human
creature
with
an
endearing
blend
of
faults
and
the
romantic
method
of
portraying
him
not
only
misrepresented
him
but
its
result
is
far
less
impressive
than
a
portrait
painted
in
the
firm
lines
of
reality
there
is
an
austere
grandeur
in
the
reality
of
what
he
is
and
does
which
needs
no
fine
gilding
from
the
sentimentalist
to
depict
him
as
a
sir
galahad
in
holy
armour
is
as
serious
an
offence
as
to
exhibit
him
as
a
caliban
of
marred
clay
each
method
fails
of
truth
and
all
that
the
soldier
needs
to
be
known
about
him
that
men
should
honour
him
is
the
truth
what
my
son
aimed
at
in
writing
this
book
was
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
men
who
were
his
comrades
in
so
far
as
it
was
given
him
to
see
it
he
was
in
haste
to
write
while
the
impression
was
fresh
in
his
mind
for
he
knew
how
soon
the
fine
edge
of
these
impressions
grew
dull
as
they
receded
from
the
immediate
area
of
vision
if
i
wait
till
the
war
is
over
i
sha
be
able
to
write
of
it
at
all
he
said
you
noticed
that
old
soldiers
are
very
often
silent
men
they
had
their
crowded
hours
of
glorious
life
but
they
rarely
tell
you
much
about
them
i
remember
you
used
to
tell
me
that
you
once
knew
a
man
who
sailed
with
napoleon
to
st
helena
but
all
he
could
tell
you
was
that
napoleon
had
a
fine
leg
and
wore
white
silk
stockings
if
he
written
down
his
impressions
of
napoleon
day
by
day
as
he
watched
him
walking
the
deck
of
the
he
have
told
you
a
great
deal
more
about
him
than
that
he
wore
white
silk
stockings
if
i
wait
till
the
war
is
over
before
i
write
about
it
it
very
likely
i
shall
recollect
only
trivial
details
and
the
big
heroic
spirit
of
the
thing
will
escape
me
there
only
one
way
of
recording
an
impression
catch
it
while
it
fresh
vivid
vital
shoot
it
on
the
wing
if
you
wait
too
long
it
will
it
was
because
he
felt
in
this
way
that
he
wrote
in
haste
sacrificing
his
brief
leave
to
the
task
and
concentrating
all
his
mind
upon
it
there
was
one
impression
that
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
record
his
sense
of
the
spiritual
processes
which
worked
behind
the
grim
offence
of
war
the
new
birth
of
religious
ideas
which
was
one
of
its
most
wonderful
results
he
had
both
witnessed
and
shared
this
renascence
it
was
too
indefinite
too
immature
to
be
chronicled
with
scientific
accuracy
but
it
was
authentic
and
indubitable
it
was
atmospheric
a
new
air
which
men
breathed
producing
new
energies
and
forms
of
thought
men
were
rediscovering
themselves
their
own
forgotten
nobilities
the
latent
nobilities
in
all
men
bound
together
in
the
daily
obedience
of
urged
by
the
conditions
of
their
task
to
regard
duty
as
inexorable
confronted
by
the
pitiless
destruction
of
the
body
they
were
forced
into
a
new
recognition
of
the
spiritual
values
of
life
in
the
common
conventional
use
of
the
term
these
men
were
not
religious
there
was
much
in
their
speech
and
in
their
conduct
which
would
outrage
the
standards
of
a
narrow
pietism
traditional
creeds
and
forms
of
faith
had
scant
authority
for
them
but
they
had
made
their
own
a
surer
faith
than
lives
in
creeds
it
was
expressed
not
in
words
but
acts
they
had
freed
their
souls
from
the
tyrannies
of
time
and
the
fear
of
death
they
had
accomplished
indeed
that
very
emancipation
of
the
soul
which
is
the
essential
evangel
of
all
religions
which
all
religions
urge
on
men
but
which
few
men
really
achieve
however
earnestly
they
profess
the
forms
of
pious
faith
this
was
the
true
glory
of
the
trenches
they
were
the
calvaries
of
a
new
redemption
being
wrought
out
for
men
by
soiled
unconscious
christs
and
as
from
that
ancient
calvary
with
all
its
agony
of
shame
torture
and
dereliction
there
flowed
a
flood
of
light
which
made
a
new
dawn
for
the
world
so
from
these
obscure
crucifixions
there
would
come
to
men
a
new
revelation
of
the
splendour
of
the
human
soul
the
true
divinity
that
dwells
in
man
the
god
made
manifest
in
the
flesh
by
acts
of
valour
heroism
and
which
transcend
the
instincts
and
promptings
of
the
flesh
and
bear
witness
to
the
indestructible
life
of
the
spirit
it
is
to
express
these
thoughts
and
convictions
that
this
book
was
written
it
is
a
record
of
things
deeply
felt
seen
and
experienced
this
first
of
all
and
chiefly
the
lesson
of
what
is
recorded
is
incidental
and
implicit
it
is
left
to
the
discovery
of
the
reader
and
yet
is
so
plainly
indicated
that
he
can
not
fail
to
discover
it
we
shall
all
see
this
war
quite
wrongly
and
shall
interpret
it
by
imperfect
and
base
equivalents
if
we
see
it
only
as
a
human
struggle
for
human
ends
we
shall
err
yet
more
miserably
if
all
our
thoughts
and
sensations
about
it
are
drawn
from
its
physical
horror
the
deformations
of
our
common
manhood
on
the
battlefield
the
hopeless
waste
and
havoc
of
it
all
we
shall
only
view
it
in
its
real
perspective
when
we
recognise
the
spiritual
impulses
which
direct
it
and
the
strange
spiritual
efficacy
that
is
in
it
to
burn
out
the
cancer
of
doubt
and
decadence
which
has
long
threatened
civilisation
with
a
slow
corrupt
death
years
ago
browning
writing
on
greek
christian
used
a
striking
sentence
to
which
the
condition
of
human
thought
lends
a
new
emphasis
we
want
she
said
the
touch
of
christ
hand
upon
our
literature
as
it
touched
other
dead
things
we
want
the
sense
of
the
saturation
of
christ
blood
upon
the
souls
of
our
poets
that
it
may
cry
through
them
in
answer
to
the
ceaseless
wail
of
the
sphinx
of
our
humanity
expounding
agony
into
renovation
something
of
this
has
been
perceived
in
art
when
its
glory
was
at
the
it
is
this
glory
of
divine
sacrifice
which
is
the
glory
of
the
trenches
it
is
because
the
writer
recognises
this
that
he
is
able
to
walk
undismayed
among
things
terrible
and
dismaying
and
to
expound
agony
into
renovation

in
hospital
hushed
and
happy
whiteness
miles
on
miles
of
cots
the
glad
contented
brightness
where
sunlight
falls
in
spots
sisters
swift
and
saintly
seem
to
tread
on
grass
like
flowers
stirring
faintly
heads
turn
to
watch
them
pass
beauty
blood
and
sorrow
blending
in
a
trance
eternity
in
this
house
of
france
sounds
of
whispered
talking
laboured
indrawn
breath
then
like
a
young
girl
walking
the
dear
familiar
death
i
the
road
to
blighty
i
am
in
hospital
in
london
lying
between
clean
white
sheets
and
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
months
clean
all
over
at
the
end
of
the
ward
there
is
a
swinging
door
if
i
listen
intently
in
the
intervals
when
the
gramophone
is
playing
i
can
hear
the
sound
of
running
running
in
a
reckless
kind
of
fashion
as
if
it
did
care
how
much
was
wasted
to
me
so
recently
out
of
the
fighting
and
so
short
a
time
in
blighty
it
seems
the
finest
music
in
the
world
for
the
sheer
luxury
of
the
contrast
i
close
my
eyes
against
the
july
sunlight
and
imagine
myself
back
in
one
of
those
narrow
where
it
is
the
thing
to
undress
because
the
row
may
start
at
any
minute
out
there
in
france
we
used
to
tell
one
another
of
how
we
would
spend
the
first
year
of
life
when
war
was
ended
one
man
had
a
baby
whom
he
never
seen
another
a
girl
whom
he
was
anxious
to
marry
my
dream
was
more
prosaic
but
no
less
ecstatic
it
began
and
ended
with
a
large
white
bed
and
a
large
white
bath
for
the
first
three
hundred
and
mornings
after
peace
had
been
declared
i
was
to
be
wakened
by
the
sound
of
my
bath
being
filled
water
was
to
be
so
plentiful
that
i
could
tumble
off
to
sleep
again
without
even
troubling
to
turn
off
the
tap
in
france
one
has
to
go
dirty
so
often
that
the
dream
of
being
always
clean
seems
as
unrealisable
as
romance
our
is
frequently
brought
up
to
us
at
the
risk
of
men
lives
carried
through
the
mud
in
strapped
on
to
packhorses
to
use
it
carelessly
would
be
like
washing
in
blood
and
here
most
marvellously
with
my
dream
come
true
i
lie
in
the
whitest
of
white
beds
the
sunlight
filters
through
trees
outside
the
window
and
weaves
patterns
on
the
floor
most
wonderful
of
all
is
the
sound
of
the
water
so
luxuriously
running
some
one
hops
out
of
bed
and
the
gramophone
the
music
of
the
tap
is
lost
up
and
down
the
ward
with
swift
precision
nurses
move
softly
they
have
the
unanxious
eyes
of
those
whose
days
are
mapped
out
with
duties
they
rarely
notice
us
as
individuals
they
ask
no
questions
show
no
curiosity
their
deeds
of
persistent
kindness
are
all
performed
impersonally
it
the
same
with
the
doctors
this
is
a
military
hospital
where
discipline
is
firmly
enforced
any
natural
recognition
of
common
fineness
is
discouraged
these
women
who
have
pledged
themselves
to
live
among
suffering
never
allow
themselves
for
a
moment
to
guess
what
the
sight
of
them
means
to
us
chaps
in
the
cots
perhaps
that
also
is
a
part
of
their
sacrifice
but
we
follow
them
with
our
eyes
and
we
wish
that
they
would
allow
themselves
to
guess
for
so
many
months
we
have
not
seen
a
woman
there
have
been
so
many
hours
when
we
expected
never
again
to
see
a
woman
lazaruses
exhumed
and
restored
to
normal
ways
of
life
by
the
fluke
of
having
collected
a
bit
of
shrapnel
we
have
yet
got
used
to
normal
ways
the
mere
rustle
of
a
woman
skirt
fills
us
with
unreasonable
delight
and
makes
the
eyes
smart
with
memories
of
old
longings
those
childish
longings
of
the
trenches
no
one
can
understand
them
who
has
not
been
there
where
all
personal
aims
are
a
and
the
courage
to
endure
remains
one
sole
possession
the
sisters
at
the
casualty
clearing
station
they
understood
the
casualty
clearing
station
is
the
first
hospital
behind
the
line
to
which
the
wounded
are
brought
down
straight
from
the
all
day
and
all
night
ambulances
come
lurching
along
roads
to
their
doors
the
men
on
the
stretchers
are
still
in
their
bloody
tunics
splashed
with
the
corruption
of
fighting
their
bodies
so
obviously
smashed
and
their
spirits
so
obviously
unbroken
the
nurses
at
the
casualty
clearing
station
can
scarcely
help
but
understand
they
can
afford
to
be
feminine
to
men
who
are
so
weak
moreover
they
are
near
enough
the
front
to
share
in
the
sublime
exaltation
of
those
who
march
out
to
die
they
know
when
a
big
offensive
is
expected
and
prepare
for
it
they
are
warned
the
moment
it
has
commenced
by
the
distant
thunder
of
the
guns
then
comes
the
ceaseless
stream
of
lorries
and
ambulances
bringing
that
which
has
been
broken
so
quickly
to
them
to
be
patched
up
in
months
they
work
day
and
night
with
a
forgetfulness
of
self
which
equals
the
devotion
of
the
soldiers
they
are
tending
despite
their
orderliness
they
seem
almost
fanatical
in
their
desire
to
spend
themselves
they
are
always
doing
but
they
can
never
do
enough
it
the
same
with
the
surgeons
i
know
of
one
who
during
a
great
attack
operated
for
hours
on
end
and
finally
went
to
sleep
where
he
stood
from
utter
weariness
the
picture
that
forms
in
my
mind
of
these
women
is
absurd
arthurian
and
exact
i
see
them
as
great
ladies
mediaeval
in
their
saintliness
sharing
the
pollution
of
the
battle
with
their
champions
lying
here
with
nothing
to
worry
about
in
the
green
serenity
of
an
english
summer
i
realize
that
no
man
can
grasp
the
splendour
of
this
war
until
he
has
made
the
trip
to
blighty
on
a
stretcher
what
i
mean
is
this
so
long
as
a
fighting
man
keeps
well
his
experience
of
the
war
consists
of
muddy
roads
leading
up
through
a
desolated
country
to
holes
in
the
ground
in
which
he
spends
most
of
his
time
watching
other
holes
in
the
ground
which
people
tell
him
are
the
hun
this
experience
is
punctuated
by
periods
during
which
the
earth
shoots
up
about
him
like
corn
popping
in
a
pan
and
he
experiences
the
insanest
fear
if
he
made
that
way
or
the
most
satisfying
kind
of
joy
about
once
a
year
something
happens
which
when
it
over
he
scarcely
believes
has
happened
he
told
that
he
can
run
away
to
england
and
pretend
that
there
is
any
war
on
for
ten
days
for
those
ten
days
so
far
as
he
concerned
hostilities
are
suspended
he
rides
through
ravaged
villages
to
the
point
from
which
the
train
starts
up
to
the
very
last
moment
until
the
engine
pulls
out
he
quite
panicky
lest
some
one
shall
come
and
snatch
his
warrant
from
him
telling
him
that
leave
has
been
cancelled
he
makes
his
journey
in
a
carriage
in
which
all
the
windows
are
smashed
probably
it
either
snows
or
rains
during
the
night
while
he
stamps
his
feet
to
keep
warm
he
remembers
that
in
his
hurry
to
escape
he
left
all
his
hun
souvenirs
behind
during
his
time
in
london
he
visits
his
tailor
at
least
twice
a
day
buys
a
vast
amount
of
unnecessary
kit
sleeps
late
does
most
of
his
resting
in
eats
innumerable
meals
at
restaurants
laughs
at
a
great
many
plays
in
which
life
at
the
front
is
depicted
as
a
joke
he
feels
dazed
and
half
suspects
that
he
is
in
london
at
all
but
only
dreaming
in
his
some
days
later
he
does
actually
wake
up
in
his
the
only
proof
he
has
that
he
been
on
leave
is
that
he
ca
pay
his
and
is
minus
a
hundred
pounds
until
a
man
is
wounded
he
only
sees
the
war
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
and
consequently
as
i
say
misses
half
its
splendour
for
he
is
ignorant
of
the
greatness
of
the
heart
that
beats
behind
him
all
along
the
lines
of
communication
here
in
brief
is
how
i
found
this
out
the
to
which
i
went
was
underneath
a
ruined
house
under
full
observation
of
the
hun
and
in
an
area
which
was
heavily
shelled
on
account
of
the
shelling
and
the
fact
that
any
movement
about
the
place
would
attract
attention
the
wounded
were
only
carried
out
by
night
moreover
to
get
back
from
the
to
the
collecting
point
in
rear
of
the
lines
the
ambulances
had
to
traverse
a
white
road
over
a
ridge
full
in
view
of
the
enemy
the
huns
kept
guns
trained
on
this
road
and
opened
fire
at
the
least
sign
of
traffic
when
i
presented
myself
i
did
think
that
there
was
anything
seriously
the
matter
my
arm
had
swelled
and
was
painful
from
a
wound
of
three
days
standing
the
doctor
however
recognised
that
septic
poisoning
had
set
in
and
that
to
save
the
arm
an
operation
was
necessary
without
loss
of
time
he
called
a
sergeant
and
sent
him
out
to
consult
with
an
this
officer
ought
to
go
out
at
once
are
you
willing
to
take
a
chance
asked
the
sergeant
the
took
a
look
at
the
chalk
road
gleaming
white
in
the
sun
where
it
climbed
the
ridge
sure
mike
he
said
and
ran
off
to
crank
his
engine
and
back
his
car
out
of
its
place
of
concealment
sure
mike
that
was
all
he
have
said
the
same
if
he
been
asked
whether
he
care
to
take
a
chance
at
hell
i
have
three
vivid
memories
of
that
drive
the
first
my
own
uneasy
sense
that
i
was
deserting
frankly
i
did
want
to
go
out
few
men
do
when
it
comes
to
the
point
the
front
has
its
own
peculiar
exhilaration
like
big
discovering
the
north
pole
or
anything
that
dangerous
and
it
has
its
own
peculiar
reward
the
peace
of
mind
that
comes
of
doing
something
beyond
dispute
unselfish
and
superlatively
worth
while
it
odd
but
it
true
that
in
the
many
a
man
experiences
peace
of
mind
for
the
first
time
and
grows
a
little
afraid
of
a
return
to
normal
ways
of
life
my
second
memory
is
of
the
wistful
faces
of
the
chaps
whom
we
passed
along
the
road
at
the
unaccustomed
sound
of
a
car
travelling
in
broad
daylight
the
tommies
poked
their
heads
out
of
like
rabbits
such
dirty
tommies
how
could
they
be
otherwise
living
forever
on
old
battlefields
if
they
were
given
time
for
reflection
they
want
to
go
out
they
choose
to
stay
with
the
game
till
the
war
was
ended
but
we
caught
them
unaware
and
as
they
gazed
after
us
down
the
first
part
of
the
long
trail
that
leads
back
from
the
trenches
to
blighty
there
was
hunger
in
their
eyes
my
third
memory
is
of
kindness
you
would
think
that
men
would
go
to
war
to
learn
how
to
be
kind
but
they
do
there
no
kinder
creature
in
the
whole
wide
world
than
the
average
tommy
he
makes
a
friend
of
any
stray
animal
he
can
find
he
shares
his
last
franc
with
a
chap
who
is
his
pal
he
risks
his
life
quite
inconsequently
to
rescue
any
one
who
wounded
when
he
gone
over
the
top
with
bomb
and
bayonet
for
the
express
purpose
of
doing
in
the
hun
he
makes
a
comrade
of
the
fritzie
he
captures
you
see
him
coming
down
the
battered
trenches
with
some
scared
lad
of
a
german
at
his
side
he
gabbling
away
making
and
signs
smiling
and
doing
his
inarticulate
best
to
be
intelligible
he
pats
the
hun
on
the
back
hands
him
chocolate
and
cigarettes
exchanges
souvenirs
and
shares
with
him
his
last
luxury
if
any
one
interferes
with
his
fritzie
he
willing
to
fight
when
they
come
to
the
cage
where
the
prisoner
has
to
be
handed
over
the
farewells
of
these
companions
whose
acquaintance
has
been
made
at
the
are
often
as
absurd
as
they
are
affecting
i
suppose
one
only
learns
the
value
of
kindness
when
he
feels
the
need
of
it
himself
the
men
out
there
have
said
to
everything
they
loved
but
they
got
to
love
some
one
so
they
give
their
affections
to
captured
fritzies
stray
dogs
fellows
who
collected
a
piece
of
a
shell
in
fact
to
any
one
who
a
little
worse
off
than
themselves
my
was
like
that
with
his
sure
he
was
like
it
during
the
entire
drive
when
he
came
to
the
white
road
which
climbs
the
ridge
with
all
the
enemy
country
staring
at
it
it
would
have
been
excusable
in
him
to
have
hurried
the
hun
barrage
might
descend
at
any
minute
all
the
way
in
the
ditches
on
either
side
dead
pack
animals
lay
in
the
there
were
other
unseen
dead
making
the
air
foul
but
he
drove
slowly
and
gently
skirting
the
with
diligent
care
so
as
to
spare
us
every
unnecessary
jolting
i
do
know
his
name
should
recognise
his
face
but
i
shall
always
remember
the
almost
womanly
tenderness
of
his
driving
after
two
changes
into
other
ambulances
at
different
distributing
points
i
arrived
about
nine
on
a
summer
evening
at
the
casualty
clearing
station
in
something
less
than
an
hour
i
was
undressed
and
on
the
operating
table
you
might
suppose
that
when
for
three
interminable
years
such
a
stream
of
tragedy
has
flowed
through
a
hospital
it
would
be
easy
for
surgeons
and
nurses
to
treat
mutilation
and
death
perfunctorily
they
do
they
show
no
emotion
they
are
even
cheerful
but
their
strained
faces
tell
the
story
and
their
hands
have
an
immense
compassion
two
faces
especially
loom
out
i
can
always
see
them
by
when
the
rest
of
the
ward
is
hushed
and
shrouded
stooping
over
some
silent
bed
one
face
is
that
of
the
colonel
of
the
hospital
grey
concerned
pitiful
stern
his
eyes
seem
to
have
photographed
all
the
suffering
which
in
three
years
they
have
witnessed
he
a
tall
man
but
he
moves
softly
over
his
uniform
he
wears
a
long
white
operating
smock
he
never
seems
to
remove
it
and
he
never
seems
to
sleep
for
he
comes
wandering
through
his
gethsemane
all
hours
of
the
night
to
bend
over
the
more
serious
cases
he
seems
haunted
by
a
vision
of
the
wives
mothers
sweethearts
whose
happiness
is
in
his
hands
i
think
of
him
as
a
christ
in
khaki
the
other
face
is
of
a
girl
a
sister
i
ought
to
call
her
she
the
nearest
approach
to
a
sculptured
greek
goddess
i
seen
in
a
living
woman
she
very
tall
very
pale
and
golden
with
wide
brows
and
big
grey
eyes
like
trilby
i
wonder
what
she
did
before
she
went
to
war
for
she
gone
to
war
just
as
truly
as
any
soldier
i
sure
in
the
peaceful
years
she
must
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
being
loved
perhaps
her
man
was
killed
out
here
now
she
with
and
spends
all
her
days
in
loving
her
eyes
have
the
old
frank
innocent
look
but
they
ringed
with
being
weary
only
her
lips
hold
a
touch
of
colour
they
have
a
childish
trick
of
trembling
when
any
one
wound
is
hurting
too
much
she
the
first
touch
of
home
that
the
see
when
they
said
to
the
trenches
she
moves
down
the
ward
eyes
follow
her
when
she
is
absent
though
others
take
her
place
she
leaves
a
loneliness
if
she
meant
much
to
men
in
days
gone
by
she
means
more
than
ever
over
many
dying
boys
she
stoops
as
the
incarnation
of
the
woman
whom
had
they
lived
they
would
have
loved
to
all
of
us
with
the
blasphemy
of
destroying
still
upon
us
she
stands
for
the
divinity
of
womanhood
what
sights
she
sees
and
what
words
she
hears
yet
the
pity
she
brings
to
her
work
preserves
her
sweetness
in
the
silence
of
the
night
those
who
are
delirious
their
recent
battles
you
when
in
the
darkened
ward
some
one
jumps
up
in
bed
shouting
hold
your
bloody
hands
he
thinks
he
capturing
a
hun
trench
taking
prisoners
in
a
bombed
in
in
an
instant
like
a
mother
with
a
frightened
child
she
bending
over
him
soon
she
has
coaxed
his
head
back
on
the
pillow
men
do
not
die
in
vain
when
they
evoke
such
women
and
the
men
the
chaps
in
the
cots
as
a
patient
the
first
sight
you
have
of
them
is
a
muddy
stretcher
the
care
with
which
the
bearers
advance
is
only
equalled
by
the
waiters
in
london
clubs
when
they
bring
in
one
of
their
choicest
wines
the
thing
on
the
stretcher
looks
horribly
like
some
of
the
forever
silent
people
you
have
seen
in
no
man
land
a
pair
of
boots
you
see
a
british
warm
flung
across
the
body
and
an
arm
dragging
a
screen
is
put
round
a
bed
the
next
sight
you
have
of
him
is
a
weary
face
lying
on
a
white
pillow
soon
the
chap
in
the
bed
next
to
him
is
questioning
what
yours
caught
me
in
both
going
to
lose
do
know
ca
feel
much
at
present
hope
then
the
questioner
raises
himself
on
his
elbow
how
it
going
is
the
attack
the
conversation
that
follows
is
always
how
hanging
on
to
such
and
such
an
objective
and
have
pushed
forward
three
hundred
yards
here
or
have
been
bent
back
there
one
thing
you
notice
every
man
forgets
his
own
catastrophe
in
his
keenness
for
the
success
of
the
offensive
never
in
all
my
fortnight
journey
to
blighty
did
i
hear
a
word
of
or
complaining
on
the
contrary
the
most
severely
wounded
men
would
profess
themselves
grateful
that
they
had
got
off
so
lightly
since
the
war
started
the
term
lightly
has
become
exceedingly
comparative
i
suppose
a
man
is
justified
in
saying
he
got
off
lightly
when
what
he
expected
was
death
i
remember
a
big
highland
officer
who
had
been
shot
in
the
he
had
been
operated
on
and
the
had
been
found
to
be
so
splintered
that
it
had
had
to
be
removed
of
this
he
was
unaware
for
the
first
day
as
he
lay
in
bed
he
kept
wondering
aloud
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
could
his
battalion
perhaps
he
suspected
his
condition
and
was
trying
to
find
out
all
his
heart
seemed
set
on
once
again
getting
into
the
fighting
next
morning
he
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
the
doctor
and
received
the
answer
he
had
dreaded
never
you
wo
be
going
back
old
next
time
he
spoke
his
voice
was
a
bit
throaty
will
it
stiffen
you
lost
the
the
doctor
said
but
with
luck
save
the
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
if
you
do
it
wo
be
much
good
will
it
not
he
lay
for
a
couple
of
hours
silent
readjusting
his
mind
to
meet
the
new
conditions
then
he
commenced
talking
with
cheerfulness
about
returning
to
his
family
the
habit
of
courage
had
conquered
the
habit
of
courage
which
grows
out
of
the
knowledge
that
you
let
your
pals
down
by
showing
cowardice
the
next
step
on
the
road
to
blighty
is
from
the
casualty
station
to
a
base
hospital
in
france
you
go
on
a
hospital
train
and
are
only
allowed
to
go
when
you
are
safe
to
travel
there
is
always
great
excitement
as
to
when
this
event
will
happen
its
precise
date
usually
depends
on
what
going
on
up
front
and
the
number
of
fresh
casualties
which
are
expected
one
morning
you
awake
to
find
that
a
tag
has
been
prepared
containing
the
entire
medical
history
of
your
injury
the
come
in
with
grins
on
their
faces
your
tag
is
tied
to
the
top
button
of
your
pyjamas
jocular
appointments
are
made
by
the
fellows
you
leave
behind
many
of
whom
you
know
are
dying
to
meet
you
in
london
and
you
are
carried
out
the
train
is
thoroughly
equipped
with
doctors
and
nurses
the
lying
cases
travel
in
little
white
bunks
no
one
who
has
not
seen
it
can
have
any
idea
of
the
high
good
spirits
which
prevail
you
going
off
to
blighty
to
piccadilly
to
dry
boots
and
clean
beds
the
revolving
wheels
underneath
you
seem
to
sing
the
words
off
to
blighty
to
it
begins
to
dawn
on
you
what
it
will
be
like
to
be
again
your
own
master
and
to
sleep
as
long
as
you
like
kindness
again
always
kindness
the
sisters
on
the
train
ca
do
enough
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
exceed
the
of
the
sisters
you
have
left
behind
you
twist
yourself
so
that
you
can
get
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
country
it
green
undisturbed
unmarred
by
shells
there
are
even
cows
at
the
base
hospital
to
which
i
went
there
was
a
man
who
performed
miracles
he
was
a
naturalised
american
citizen
but
an
armenian
by
birth
he
gave
people
new
faces
the
first
morning
an
officer
came
in
to
visit
a
friend
his
face
was
entirely
swathed
in
bandages
with
gaps
left
for
his
breathing
and
his
eyes
he
had
been
like
that
for
two
years
and
looked
like
a
leper
when
he
spoke
he
made
hollow
noises
his
nose
and
lower
jaw
had
been
torn
away
by
an
exploding
shell
little
by
little
with
infinite
skill
by
the
grafting
of
bone
and
flesh
his
face
was
being
built
up
could
any
surgery
be
more
merciful
in
the
days
that
followed
i
saw
several
of
these
masked
men
the
worst
cases
were
not
allowed
to
walk
about
the
ones
i
saw
were
invariably
dressed
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
in
the
smartest
uniforms
sam
browns
polished
and
buttons
shining
they
had
hope
and
took
a
pride
in
themselves
a
splendid
sign
perhaps
you
ask
why
the
should
be
kept
in
france
i
was
not
told
but
i
can
guess
because
they
dread
going
back
to
england
to
their
girls
until
they
got
rid
of
their
disfigurements
so
for
two
years
through
their
bandages
they
watch
the
train
pull
out
for
blighty
while
the
damage
which
was
done
them
in
the
fragment
of
a
second
is
repaired
at
a
base
hospital
you
see
something
which
you
do
see
at
a
casualty
station
sisters
mothers
sweethearts
and
wives
sitting
beside
the
beds
they
allowed
to
come
over
from
england
when
their
man
is
dying
one
of
the
wonderful
things
to
me
was
to
observe
how
these
women
in
the
hour
of
their
tragedy
catch
the
soldier
spirit
very
quiet
very
cheerful
very
helpful
with
passing
through
the
ward
they
get
to
know
some
of
the
other
patients
and
remember
them
when
they
bring
their
own
man
flowers
sometimes
when
their
own
man
is
asleep
they
slip
over
to
other
bedsides
and
do
something
kind
for
the
solitary
fellows
that
the
army
all
over
military
discipline
is
based
on
unselfishness
these
women
who
have
been
sent
for
to
see
their
men
die
catch
from
them
the
spirit
of
undistressed
sacrifice
and
enrol
themselves
as
soldiers
next
to
my
bed
there
was
a
colonel
of
a
north
country
regiment
a
gallant
gentleman
who
positively
refused
to
die
his
wife
had
been
with
him
for
two
weeks
a
little
toy
woman
with
nerves
worn
to
a
frazzle
who
masked
her
terror
with
a
brave
set
smile
the
colonel
had
had
his
leg
smashed
by
a
when
leading
his
troops
into
action
septic
poisoning
had
set
in
and
the
leg
had
been
amputated
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
operate
several
times
owing
to
the
poison
spreading
with
the
result
that
being
far
from
a
young
man
his
strength
was
exhausted
men
forgot
their
own
wounds
in
watching
this
one
man
fight
for
life
he
became
symbolic
of
what
in
varying
degrees
we
were
all
doing
when
he
was
passing
through
a
crisis
the
whole
ward
waited
breathless
there
was
the
finest
kind
of
rivalry
between
the
night
and
day
sisters
to
hand
him
over
at
the
end
of
each
twelve
hours
with
his
pulse
stronger
and
temperature
lower
than
when
they
received
him
each
was
sure
she
had
the
secret
of
keeping
him
alive
you
discovered
the
spirit
of
the
man
when
you
heard
him
wandering
in
delirium
all
night
in
the
shadowy
ward
with
its
hooded
lamps
he
would
be
giving
orders
for
the
comfort
of
his
men
sometimes
he
be
proposing
to
go
forward
himself
to
a
place
where
a
company
was
having
a
hot
time
apparently
one
of
his
officers
was
trying
to
dissuade
him
danger
be
damned
he
exclaim
in
a
wonderfully
strong
voice
it
buck
up
to
see
me
splendid
chaps
splendid
chaps
about
dawn
he
was
usually
supposed
to
be
sinking
but
he
rallied
again
by
the
time
the
arrived
still
here
he
smile
in
a
triumphant
kind
of
whisper
as
though
bluffing
death
was
a
pastime
one
afternoon
a
padre
came
to
visit
him
as
he
was
leaving
he
bent
above
the
pillow
we
learnt
afterwards
that
this
was
what
he
had
said
if
the
good
lord
lets
you
i
hope
you
get
we
saw
the
colonel
raise
himself
up
on
his
elbow
his
weak
voice
shook
with
anger
neither
god
nor
the
devil
has
anything
to
do
with
it
i
going
to
get
then
as
the
nurse
came
hurrying
to
him
he
sank
back
when
i
left
the
base
hospital
for
blighty
he
was
still
holding
his
own
i
have
never
heard
what
happened
to
him
but
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
meet
him
one
day
in
the
trenches
with
a
wooden
leg
still
leading
his
splendid
chaps
death
ca
kill
men
of
such
heroic
courage
at
the
base
hospital
they
talk
a
good
deal
of
the
blighty
it
supposed
to
be
the
kind
of
look
a
chap
wears
when
he
been
told
that
within
hours
he
be
in
england
when
this
information
has
been
imparted
to
him
he
served
out
with
warm
socks
woollen
cap
and
a
little
linen
bag
into
which
to
put
his
valuables
hours
and
hours
before
there
any
chance
of
starting
you
see
the
lucky
ones
lying
very
still
with
a
happy
vacant
look
in
their
eyes
and
their
absurd
woollen
caps
stuck
ready
on
their
heads
sometime
perhaps
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
arrive
the
who
all
down
the
lines
of
communication
are
forever
carrying
others
towards
blessedness
and
never
going
themselves
at
last
you
whisper
to
yourself
you
feel
a
glorious
anticipation
that
you
have
not
known
since
childhood
when
after
three
hundred
and
days
of
waiting
it
was
truly
going
to
be
christmas
on
the
train
and
on
the
passage
there
is
the
same
skillful
attention
the
same
ungrudging
kindness
you
see
new
faces
in
the
bunks
beside
you
after
the
tedium
of
the
narrow
confines
of
a
ward
that
in
itself
is
exciting
you
fall
into
talk
what
yours
nothing
much
just
a
hand
off
and
a
splinter
or
two
in
the
you
laugh
that
not
so
dusty
how
much
did
you
expect
for
your
money
probably
you
meet
some
one
from
the
part
of
the
line
where
you
were
wounded
with
luck
even
from
your
own
brigade
battery
or
battalion
then
the
talk
becomes
all
about
how
things
are
going
whether
still
holding
on
to
our
objectives
who
got
a
blighty
and
who
gone
west
one
discussion
you
do
often
hear
as
to
when
the
war
will
end
to
these
civilians
in
khaki
it
seems
that
the
war
has
always
been
and
that
they
will
never
cease
to
be
soldiers
for
them
both
past
and
future
are
utterly
obliterated
they
would
not
have
it
otherwise
because
they
are
doing
their
duty
they
are
contented
the
only
time
the
subject
is
ever
touched
on
is
when
some
one
expresses
the
hope
that
it
last
long
enough
for
him
to
recover
from
his
wounds
and
get
back
into
the
line
that
usually
starts
another
man
who
will
never
be
any
more
good
for
the
trenches
wondering
whether
he
can
get
into
the
flying
corps
the
one
ultimate
hope
of
all
these
shattered
wrecks
who
are
being
hurried
to
the
blighty
they
have
dreamt
of
is
that
they
may
again
see
service
the
tang
of
salt
in
the
air
the
beat
of
waves
and
then
incredible
even
when
it
has
been
realised
england
i
think
they
ought
to
make
the
hospital
trains
which
run
to
london
all
of
glass
then
instead
of
watching
little
triangles
of
flying
country
by
leaning
uncomfortably
far
out
of
their
bunks
the
wounded
would
be
able
to
drink
their
full
of
the
greenness
which
they
have
longed
for
so
many
months
the
trees
are
charred
and
blackened
stumps
they
harps
between
the
knees
of
the
hills
played
on
by
the
wind
and
sun
the
villages
have
their
roofs
on
and
children
romping
in
their
streets
the
church
spires
have
been
knocked
down
they
stand
up
tall
and
stately
the
roadsides
are
littered
with
empty
and
dead
horses
the
fields
are
absolutely
fields
with
green
crops
all
wavy
like
hair
growing
after
the
tonsured
filth
we
been
accustomed
to
call
a
world
all
this
strikes
one
as
unnatural
and
extraordinary
there
a
sweet
fragrance
over
everything
and
one
throat
feels
lumpy
perhaps
it
is
good
for
people
health
to
have
lumpy
throats
and
why
they
do
run
glass
trains
to
london
then
after
such
excited
waiting
you
feel
that
the
engine
is
slowing
down
there
a
hollow
rumbling
you
crossing
the
dear
old
wrinkled
thames
if
you
looked
out
you
see
the
dome
of
paul
like
a
bubble
on
the
and
smoking
chimneys
sticking
up
like
thumbs
things
quite
ugly
and
things
of
surpassing
beauty
all
of
which
you
have
never
hoped
to
see
again
and
which
in
dreams
you
have
loved
but
if
you
could
look
out
you
would
have
the
time
getting
your
things
together
so
you
wo
waste
a
moment
when
they
come
to
carry
you
out
very
probably
you
secreting
a
souvenir
or
two
about
your
person
something
you
smuggled
down
from
the
front
which
will
really
prove
to
your
people
that
you
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
hun
as
though
your
wounds
did
prove
that
sufficiently
men
are
childish
the
engine
comes
to
a
halt
you
can
smell
the
really
there
an
officer
comes
through
the
train
enquiring
whether
you
have
any
preference
as
to
hospitals
your
girl
lives
in
liverpool
or
glasgow
or
birmingham
good
heavens
the
fellow
holds
your
destiny
in
his
hands
he
can
send
you
to
whitechapel
if
he
likes
so
even
though
he
has
the
same
rank
as
yourself
you
address
him
as
perhaps
it
because
i
practised
this
diplomacy
i
know
anyway
he
granted
my
request
i
to
stay
in
london
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
stay
in
london
because
one
of
my
young
brothers
from
the
navy
is
there
on
leave
at
present
in
fact
he
wired
me
to
france
that
the
admiralty
had
allowed
him
a
special
extension
of
leave
in
order
that
he
might
see
me
it
was
on
the
strength
of
this
message
that
the
doctors
at
the
base
hospital
permitted
me
to
take
the
journey
several
days
before
i
was
really
in
a
condition
to
travel
i
wondering
whether
he
gained
admission
to
the
platform
i
lie
there
in
my
bunk
all
eyes
expecting
any
minute
to
see
him
enter
time
and
again
i
mistake
the
blue
serge
uniform
of
the
john
ambulance
for
that
of
a
naval
lieutenant
they
come
to
carry
me
out
what
an
extraordinarily
funny
way
to
enter
london
on
a
stretcher
arrived
on
from
america
troop
trains
from
canada
and
come
back
from
romantic
romps
in
italy
but
never
in
my
wildest
imaginings
did
i
picture
myself
arriving
as
a
wounded
soldier
on
a
red
cross
train
still
clutching
my
absurd
linen
bag
which
contains
my
valuables
i
lift
my
head
from
the
pillow
gazing
round
for
any
glimpse
of
that
brother
now
they
popped
me
onto
the
of
a
waiting
ambulance
i
can
see
nothing
except
what
lies
out
at
the
back
i
at
once
start
explaining
to
the
nurse
who
accompanies
us
that
lost
a
very
valuable
brother
that
he
probably
looking
for
me
somewhere
on
the
station
she
extremely
sympathetic
and
asks
the
chauffeur
to
drive
very
slowly
so
that
we
may
watch
for
him
as
we
go
through
the
station
gates
into
the
strand
we
delayed
for
some
minutes
while
particulars
are
checked
up
of
our
injuries
and
destinations
the
lying
cases
are
placed
four
in
an
ambulance
with
the
flap
raised
at
the
back
so
we
can
see
out
the
sitting
cases
travel
in
automobiles
buses
and
various
kinds
of
vehicles
in
my
ambulance
there
are
two
with
most
theatrical
bandages
and
one
case
of
we
immensely
merry
all
except
the
case
who
has
conceived
an
immense
sorrow
for
himself
we
get
impatient
with
waiting
there
an
awful
lot
of
cheering
going
on
somewhere
we
suppose
troops
are
marching
and
ca
make
it
out
ah
we
started
at
a
slow
crawl
to
prevent
jarring
we
pass
through
the
gates
we
discover
the
meaning
of
the
cheering
on
either
side
the
people
are
lined
in
dense
crowds
waving
and
shouting
it
saturday
evening
when
they
should
be
in
the
country
it
jolly
decent
of
them
to
come
here
to
give
us
such
a
welcome
are
here
with
their
baskets
full
of
flowers
just
poor
girls
with
a
living
to
earn
they
run
after
us
as
we
pass
and
strew
us
with
roses
roses
we
stretch
out
our
hands
pressing
them
to
our
lips
how
long
is
it
since
we
held
roses
in
our
hands
how
did
these
girls
of
the
london
streets
know
that
above
all
things
we
longed
for
flowers
it
was
worth
it
all
the
mud
and
stench
and
beastliness
when
it
was
to
this
that
the
road
led
back
and
the
girls
they
even
better
than
the
flowers
so
many
pretty
faces
made
kind
by
compassion
somewhere
inside
ourselves
laughing
we
so
happy
we
do
need
any
one
pity
time
enough
for
that
when
we
start
to
pity
ourselves
we
feel
mean
as
though
we
were
part
of
a
big
deception
we
are
half
so
ill
as
we
look
if
you
put
sufficient
bandages
on
a
wound
you
can
make
the
healthiest
man
appear
tragic
we
laughing
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
crying
we
press
our
faces
against
the
pillow
ashamed
of
ourselves
we
see
the
crowds
we
angry
with
them
for
having
unmanned
us
and
then
we
ca
help
looking
their
love
reaches
us
almost
as
though
it
were
the
touch
of
hands
we
wo
hide
ourselves
if
we
mean
so
much
to
them
we
not
angry
any
more
but
grateful
suddenly
the
shouts
to
the
driver
the
ambulance
stops
she
quite
excited
clutching
me
with
one
hand
she
points
with
the
other
there
he
who
i
raise
myself
a
naval
lieutenant
is
standing
against
the
pavement
gazing
anxiously
at
the
passing
traffic
your
brother
is
it
i
shook
my
head
not
half
handsome
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
she
convinced
i
have
a
headache
it
no
good
telling
her
that
i
have
much
to
my
annoyance
and
amusement
she
swabs
my
forehead
with
telling
me
that
i
shall
soon
feel
better
the
streets
through
which
we
pass
are
on
the
south
side
of
the
thames
it
saturday
evening
hawkers
barrows
line
the
kerb
women
with
draggled
skirts
and
once
gay
hats
are
doing
their
sunday
shopping
we
having
a
kind
of
triumphant
procession
with
these
people
to
feel
is
to
express
we
catch
some
of
their
remarks
look
at
poor
leg
my
but
ai
done
in
shockin
dear
old
london
so
kind
so
brave
so
frankly
human
you
just
like
the
chaps
at
the
front
you
laugh
when
you
suffer
and
give
when
starving
you
never
know
when
not
to
be
generous
you
wear
your
heart
in
your
eyes
and
your
lips
are
always
ready
for
kissing
i
think
of
you
as
one
of
your
own
hoarse
of
voice
slatternly
as
to
corsets
with
a
big
tumbled
fringe
over
your
forehead
and
a
heart
so
big
that
you
can
chuck
away
your
roses
to
a
wounded
tommy
and
go
away
yourself
with
an
empty
basket
to
sleep
under
an
archway
do
you
wonder
that
to
us
you
spell
blighty
we
love
you
we
come
to
a
neighbourhood
more
respectable
and
less
demonstrative
skirt
a
common
are
stopped
at
a
porter
lodge
and
turn
into
a
parkland
the
glow
of
sunset
is
ended
the
of
twilight
is
settling
down
between
flowered
borders
we
pick
our
way
pause
here
and
there
for
directions
and
at
last
halt
again
the
as
i
am
carried
in
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
low
with
others
like
it
dotted
about
beneath
trees
there
are
red
shaded
lamps
every
one
tiptoes
in
silence
only
the
lips
move
when
people
speak
there
is
scarcely
any
sound
as
the
stretchers
are
borne
down
the
ward
men
shift
their
heads
to
gaze
after
them
it
past
ten
and
patients
are
supposed
to
be
sleeping
now
i
put
to
bed
there
no
news
of
my
brother
he
has
and
has
called
i
persuade
one
of
the
orderlies
to
ring
up
the
hotel
at
which
i
know
he
was
staying
the
man
is
a
long
while
gone
through
the
dim
length
of
the
ward
i
watch
the
door
into
the
garden
momentarily
expecting
the
familiar
figure
in
the
blue
uniform
and
gold
buttons
to
enter
he
does
then
at
length
the
orderly
returns
to
tell
me
that
the
naval
lieutenant
who
was
staying
at
the
hotel
had
to
set
out
for
his
ship
that
evening
as
there
was
no
train
that
he
could
catch
on
sunday
so
he
was
steaming
out
of
london
for
the
north
at
the
moment
i
was
entering
disappointed
yes
one
shrugs
his
shoulders
la
as
we
say
in
the
trenches
you
ca
have
everything
when
europe
at
war
i
can
hardly
keep
awake
long
enough
for
the
sister
to
dress
my
arm
the
roses
that
the
had
thrown
me
are
in
water
and
within
handstretch
they
seem
almost
persons
and
curiously
sacred
symbols
of
all
the
heroism
and
kindness
that
has
ministered
to
me
every
step
of
the
journey
it
a
good
little
war
i
think
to
myself
then
with
the
green
smell
of
england
in
my
nostrils
and
the
rumbling
of
london
in
my
ears
like
conversation
below
stairs
i
drowse
off
into
the
utter
contentment
of
the
first
deep
sleep
i
have
had
since
i
was
wounded
i
am
roused
all
too
soon
by
some
one
sticking
a
thermometer
into
my
mouth
rubbing
my
eyes
i
consult
my
watch
five
rather
early
raising
myself
stealthily
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
neat
little
sister
darting
down
the
ward
from
bed
to
bed
every
sleeping
face
with
a
fresh
thermometer
having
made
the
round
back
she
comes
to
take
possession
of
my
hand
while
she
counts
my
pulse
i
try
to
speak
but
she
wo
let
me
remove
the
accursed
thermometer
when
she
has
removed
it
herself
off
she
goes
to
the
next
bed
i
notice
that
she
has
auburn
hair
merry
blue
eyes
and
a
ripping
irish
accent
i
learn
later
that
she
a
sinn
feiner
a
sworn
enemy
to
england
who
sings
dark
rosaleen
and
other
rebel
songs
in
the
secret
watches
of
the
night
it
seems
to
me
that
in
taking
care
of
wounded
she
solving
the
irish
problem
pretty
well
heavens
she
back
again
this
time
with
a
bowl
of
water
and
a
towel
very
severely
and
thoroughly
as
though
i
were
a
dirty
urchin
she
scrubs
my
face
and
hands
she
even
brushes
my
hair
i
watch
her
do
the
same
for
other
patients
some
of
whom
are
colonels
and
old
enough
to
be
her
father
she
evidently
in
no
mood
for
proposals
of
marriage
at
this
early
hour
for
her
technique
is
impartially
severe
to
everybody
though
her
blue
eyes
are
unfailingly
laughing
it
is
at
this
point
that
somebody
crawls
out
of
bed
slips
into
a
passes
through
the
swing
door
at
the
end
of
the
ward
and
sets
the
running
the
sound
of
it
is
ecstatic
very
soon
others
follow
his
example
they
chaps
without
legs
with
an
arm
gone
a
hand
gone
back
wounds
stomach
wounds
holes
in
the
head
they
start
chaffing
one
another
there
no
hint
of
tragedy
a
gale
of
laughter
sweeps
the
ward
from
end
to
end
an
anzac
captain
is
called
on
for
a
speech
i
discover
that
he
is
our
professional
comic
man
and
is
called
on
to
make
speeches
twenty
times
a
day
they
always
start
with
gentlemen
i
will
say
this
and
end
with
a
flourish
in
praise
of
australia
soon
the
ward
is
made
perilous
by
in
which
unskilful
pilots
steer
themselves
out
into
the
green
adventure
of
the
garden
birds
are
singing
out
there
the
guns
had
done
for
the
birds
in
the
places
where
we
came
from
through
open
doors
we
can
see
the
glow
of
flowers
and
sparkling
lazily
unfolding
their
petals
in
the
early
sun
when
the
sister
back
is
turned
a
officer
nips
out
of
bed
and
hops
like
a
crow
to
the
gramophone
the
song
that
follows
is
a
favourite
curious
that
it
should
be
for
it
paints
a
dream
which
to
many
of
these
mutilated
men
canadians
australians
south
africans
imperials
will
have
to
remain
only
a
dream
so
long
as
life
lasts
girls
do
marry
fellows
without
arms
and
legs
at
least
they
did
in
peace
days
before
the
world
became
heroic
as
the
gramophone
commences
to
sing
heads
on
pillows
hum
the
air
and
fingers
tap
in
time
on
the
sheets
it
a
peculiarly
childish
song
for
men
who
have
seen
what
they
have
seen
and
done
what
they
have
done
to
be
so
fond
of
here
the
way
it
runs
we
have
a
little
cottage
in
a
little
town
and
well
have
a
little
mistress
in
a
dainty
gown
a
little
doggie
a
little
cat
a
little
doorstep
with
welcome
on
the
mat
and
we
have
a
little
trouble
and
a
little
strife
but
none
of
these
things
matter
when
you
got
a
little
wife
we
shall
be
as
happy
as
the
angels
up
above
with
a
little
patience
and
a
lot
of
a
little
patience
and
a
lot
of
love
i
suppose
that
the
line
caught
the
chaps
behind
all
their
smiling
and
their
boyish
gaiety
they
know
that
they
need
both
patience
and
love
to
meet
the
balance
of
existence
with
sweetness
and
soldierly
courage
it
wo
be
so
easy
to
be
soldiers
when
they
get
back
into
mufti
and
go
out
into
the
world
cripples
here
in
their
pyjamas
in
the
summer
sun
they
making
a
first
class
effort
i
take
another
look
at
them
no
there
never
be
any
whining
from
men
such
as
these
some
of
us
will
soon
be
back
in
the
fighting
and
jolly
glad
of
it
others
are
doomed
to
remain
in
the
trenches
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
not
the
trenches
of
the
where
they
been
strafed
by
the
hun
but
the
trenches
of
physical
curtailment
where
will
launch
wave
after
wave
of
attack
against
them
it
wo
be
easy
not
to
get
the
wind
it
be
difficult
to
maintain
normal
cheerfulness
but
they
not
the
men
they
were
before
they
went
to
war
out
there
they
learnt
something
they
game
they
remain
soldiers
whatever
happens
the
lads
away
all
the
lads
have
gone
out
to
play
at
being
soldiers
far
away
they
wo
be
back
for
many
a
day
and
some
wo
be
back
any
morning
all
the
lassies
who
laughing
were
when
hearts
were
light
and
lads
were
here
go
wandering
hither
and
there
they
pray
and
they
watch
for
the
morning
every
house
has
its
vacant
bed
and
every
night
when
sounds
are
dead
some
woman
yearns
for
the
pillowed
head
of
him
who
marched
out
in
the
morning
of
all
the
lads
who
gone
out
to
play
there
some
return
and
some
who
stay
there
some
will
be
back
any
day
but
some
wo
wake
up
in
the
morning
ii
the
growing
of
the
vision
i
continuing
in
america
the
book
which
i
thought
out
during
the
golden
july
and
august
days
when
i
lay
in
the
hospital
in
london
been
here
a
fortnight
everything
that
happened
seems
unbelievably
wonderful
as
though
it
had
happened
to
some
one
other
than
myself
it
seem
still
more
wonderful
in
a
few
weeks
time
when
where
i
hope
i
shall
be
back
in
the
mud
at
the
front
here
how
this
miraculous
turn
of
events
occurred
when
i
went
before
my
medical
board
i
was
declared
unfit
for
active
service
for
at
least
two
months
a
few
days
later
i
went
in
to
general
headquarters
to
see
what
were
the
chances
of
a
trip
to
new
york
the
officer
whom
i
consulted
pulled
out
his
watch
it
noon
now
there
a
leaving
euston
in
two
and
a
half
hours
do
you
think
you
can
pack
up
and
make
it
i
you
watch
me
i
cried
dashing
out
into
regent
street
i
rounded
up
a
taxi
and
raced
about
london
like
one
possessed
collecting
kit
visiting
tailors
withdrawing
money
telephoning
friends
with
whom
i
had
dinner
and
theatre
engagements
it
an
extraordinary
characteristic
of
the
army
but
however
hurried
an
officer
may
be
he
can
always
spare
time
to
visit
his
tailor
the
fare
i
paid
my
was
too
monstrous
for
words
but
then
he
missed
his
lunch
and
one
has
to
miss
so
many
things
in
that
when
a
new
straw
of
inconvenience
is
piled
on
the
camel
the
camel
expects
to
be
compensated
anyway
i
was
on
that
when
it
pulled
out
of
london
i
was
in
uniform
when
i
arrived
in
new
york
for
i
did
possess
any
mufti
you
ca
guess
what
a
difference
that
made
to
not
the
being
in
uniform
but
the
knowing
that
it
an
offence
to
wear
it
on
my
last
leave
some
time
ago
before
i
went
overseas
if
i
tried
to
cross
the
border
from
canada
in
uniform
have
been
turned
back
if
by
any
chance
i
got
across
and
worn
regimentals
i
have
been
arrested
by
the
first
irish
policeman
a
place
is
home
where
you
get
turned
back
or
locked
up
for
wearing
the
things
of
which
you
proudest
if
america
had
come
into
the
war
none
of
us
who
have
loved
her
and
since
been
to
the
trenches
would
ever
have
wanted
to
return
but
she
home
now
as
she
never
was
before
and
never
could
have
been
under
any
other
circumstances
now
that
khaki
strides
unabashed
down
broadway
and
the
skirl
of
the
pipers
has
been
heard
on
fifth
avenue
we
men
over
there
will
have
to
find
a
new
name
for
america
it
wo
be
exactly
blighty
but
a
kind
of
very
wealthy
first
cousin
to
blighty
a
word
meaning
something
generous
and
affectionate
and
waiting
for
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
two
weeks
here
already
two
weeks
more
to
go
then
back
to
the
glory
of
the
trenches
there
one
person
i
missed
since
my
return
to
new
york
caught
glimpses
of
him
disappearing
around
corners
but
he
dodges
i
think
he
a
bit
ashamed
to
meet
me
that
person
is
my
old
civilian
self
what
a
egoist
he
used
to
be
how
full
of
golden
plans
for
his
own
advancement
how
terrified
of
failure
of
disease
of
money
losses
of
death
of
all
the
temporary
external
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
spirit
war
is
in
itself
damnable
a
profligate
misuse
of
the
accumulated
of
centuries
nevertheless
there
many
a
man
who
has
no
love
of
war
who
previous
to
the
war
had
cramped
his
soul
with
littleness
and
was
chased
by
the
bayonet
of
duty
into
the
largeness
of
the
trenches
who
has
learnt
to
say
thank
god
for
this
he
thanks
god
not
because
of
the
carnage
but
because
when
the
of
new
ideals
was
being
trodden
he
was
born
in
an
age
when
he
could
do
his
share
america
going
through
just
about
the
same
experience
as
myself
she
feeling
broader
in
the
chest
bigger
in
the
heart
and
her
eyes
are
clearer
when
she
catches
sight
of
the
america
that
she
was
she
filled
with
doubt
she
ca
believe
that
that
person
with
the
stars
and
stripes
wrapped
round
her
and
a
in
either
hand
ever
was
herself
home
clean
and
honourable
for
every
man
who
ever
loved
her
and
has
pledged
his
life
for
an
ideal
with
the
allies
that
what
she
become
now
i
read
again
the
words
that
i
wrote
about
those
chaps
in
the
london
hospital
men
who
had
journeyed
to
their
calvary
from
the
farthest
corners
of
the
world
from
this
distance
i
see
them
in
truer
perspective
than
when
we
lay
companions
side
by
side
in
that
long
line
of
neat
white
cots
i
used
to
grope
after
ways
to
explain
them
to
explain
the
courage
which
in
their
utter
heroism
they
did
not
realise
they
possessed
they
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
a
brave
way
of
living
that
they
sincerely
believed
they
were
quite
ordinary
persons
courage
at
its
finest
when
it
becomes
unconscious
and
instinctive
at
first
i
said
i
know
why
they
so
cheerful
it
because
all
here
in
one
ward
together
they
all
mutilated
more
or
less
so
they
do
feel
that
they
exceptional
it
as
though
the
whole
world
woke
up
with
toothache
one
morning
at
breakfast
every
one
would
be
feeling
very
sorry
for
himself
by
when
it
had
become
common
knowledge
that
the
entire
world
had
the
same
kind
of
ache
toothache
would
have
ceased
to
exist
it
the
loneliness
of
being
abnormal
in
your
suffering
that
but
it
was
that
even
while
i
was
confined
to
the
hospital
in
hourly
contact
with
the
chaps
i
felt
that
it
was
that
when
i
was
allowed
to
dress
and
go
down
west
for
a
few
hours
everyday
i
knew
that
i
was
wrong
most
certainly
in
piccadilly
hyde
park
theatres
restaurants
on
the
thames
you
see
them
these
men
who
were
maimed
for
life
climbing
up
and
down
buses
hobbling
on
their
crutches
independently
through
crowds
hailing
one
another
cheerily
from
taxis
drinking
life
joyously
in
big
gulps
without
complaint
or
sense
of
martyrdom
and
getting
none
of
the
dregs
a
part
of
their
secret
was
that
through
their
experience
in
the
trenches
they
had
learnt
to
be
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
a
wounded
man
lose
his
temper
was
when
some
one
out
of
kindness
made
him
remember
himself
a
sudden
of
rain
had
commenced
it
was
towards
evening
and
all
the
employees
of
the
west
end
shopping
centre
were
making
haste
to
get
home
to
the
suburbs
a
young
highland
officer
who
had
lost
a
leg
scrambled
into
a
bus
going
to
wandsworth
the
inside
of
the
bus
was
jammed
so
he
had
to
stand
up
clutching
on
to
a
strap
a
gentleman
rose
from
his
seat
and
offered
it
to
the
highlander
the
highlander
smiled
his
thanks
and
shook
his
head
the
gentleman
in
his
sympathy
became
pressing
attracting
attention
to
the
officer
infirmity
it
was
then
that
the
officer
lost
his
temper
i
saw
him
flush
i
do
want
it
he
said
sharply
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
thanks
all
the
same
i
this
habit
of
being
gives
one
time
to
be
remindful
of
others
last
january
during
a
brief
and
glorious
ten
days
leave
i
went
to
a
matinée
at
the
coliseum
vesta
tilley
was
doing
an
extraordinarily
funny
impersonation
of
a
tommy
just
home
from
the
comfort
of
the
trenches
her
sketch
depicted
the
terrible
discomforts
of
a
fighting
man
on
leave
in
blighty
if
i
remember
rightly
the
refrain
of
her
song
ran
somewhat
in
this
fashion
next
time
they
want
to
give
me
six
days
leave
let
make
it
six
months
there
were
two
officers
a
major
and
a
captain
behind
us
judging
by
the
sounds
they
made
they
were
getting
their
full
money
worth
of
enjoyment
in
the
interval
when
the
lights
went
up
i
turned
and
saw
the
captain
putting
a
cigarette
between
the
major
lips
then
having
gripped
a
between
his
knees
so
that
he
might
strike
the
match
he
lit
the
cigarette
for
his
friend
very
awkwardly
i
looked
closer
and
discovered
that
the
laughing
captain
had
only
one
hand
and
the
equally
happy
major
had
none
at
all
men
forget
their
own
infirmities
in
their
endeavour
to
help
each
other
before
the
war
we
had
a
phrase
which
has
taken
on
a
new
meaning
now
we
used
to
talk
about
lending
a
we
lend
not
only
hands
but
arms
and
eyes
and
legs
the
wonderful
comradeship
learnt
in
the
trenches
has
taught
men
to
lend
their
bodies
to
each
other
out
of
two
maimed
bodies
to
make
up
one
which
is
whole
and
sound
and
shared
you
saw
this
all
the
time
in
hospital
a
man
who
had
only
one
leg
would
pal
up
with
a
man
who
had
only
one
arm
the
man
would
wheel
the
man
about
the
garden
in
a
chair
at
the
man
would
cut
up
the
man
food
for
him
they
had
both
lost
something
but
by
pooling
what
was
left
they
managed
to
own
a
complete
body
by
the
time
the
war
is
ended
there
be
great
hosts
of
helpless
men
who
by
combining
will
have
learnt
how
to
become
helpful
they
establish
a
new
standard
of
very
simple
and
cheerful
socialism
there
a
point
i
want
to
make
clear
before
i
forget
it
all
these
men
whether
they
capturing
hun
at
the
front
or
taking
prisoner
their
own
despair
in
english
hospitals
are
perfectly
ordinary
and
normal
before
the
war
they
were
plumbers
lawyers
vaudeville
artists
they
were
men
of
no
heroic
training
their
civilian
callings
and
their
previous
social
status
were
too
various
for
any
one
to
suppose
that
they
were
heroes
at
birth
something
has
happened
to
them
since
they
marched
away
in
khaki
something
that
has
changed
them
they
as
completely
as
paul
was
after
he
had
had
his
vision
of
the
opening
heavens
on
the
road
to
damascus
they
brought
their
vision
back
with
them
to
civilian
life
despite
the
lost
arms
and
legs
which
they
scarcely
seem
to
regret
their
souls
still
triumph
over
the
body
and
the
temporal
as
they
hobble
through
the
streets
of
london
they
display
the
same
gay
courage
that
was
theirs
when
at
zero
hour
with
a
chance
of
death
they
hopped
over
the
top
for
the
attack
often
at
the
front
i
have
thought
of
christ
explanation
of
his
own
unassailable
peace
an
explanation
given
to
his
disciples
at
the
last
supper
immediately
before
the
walk
to
gethsemane
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
overcome
the
overcoming
the
world
as
i
understand
it
is
overcoming
self
fear
in
its
final
analysis
is
nothing
but
selfishness
a
man
who
is
afraid
in
an
attack
is
thinking
of
his
pals
and
how
quickly
terror
spreads
he
is
thinking
of
the
glory
which
will
accrue
to
his
regiment
or
division
if
the
attack
is
a
success
he
is
thinking
of
what
he
can
do
to
contribute
to
that
success
he
is
thinking
of
the
splendour
of
forcing
his
spirit
to
triumph
over
weariness
and
nerves
and
the
abominations
that
the
huns
are
chucking
at
him
he
thinking
merely
of
how
he
can
save
his
worthless
skin
and
conduct
his
entirely
unimportant
body
to
a
place
where
there
are
any
shells
in
london
as
i
saw
the
unconscious
nobility
of
the
maimed
and
wounded
the
words
i
have
overcome
the
world
took
an
added
depth
all
these
men
have
an
look
in
their
faces
it
comparatively
easy
for
a
soldier
with
traditions
and
ideals
at
his
back
to
face
death
calmly
to
be
calm
in
the
face
of
life
as
these
chaps
are
takes
a
graver
courage
what
has
happened
to
change
them
these
disabilities
had
they
happened
before
the
war
would
have
crushed
and
embittered
them
they
would
have
been
woes
utterly
and
inconsolably
unbearable
intrinsically
their
physical
disablements
spell
the
same
loss
that
they
would
have
in
the
attitude
of
mind
in
which
they
are
accepted
alone
makes
them
seem
less
this
attitude
of
mind
or
greatness
of
soul
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
was
learnt
in
the
trenches
where
everything
outward
is
polluted
and
damnable
their
experience
at
the
front
has
given
them
what
in
the
army
language
is
known
as
guts
or
courage
is
an
attitude
of
mind
towards
calamity
an
attitude
of
mind
which
makes
the
honourable
accomplishing
of
duty
more
permanently
satisfying
than
the
preservation
of
self
but
how
did
this
vision
come
to
these
men
how
did
they
rid
themselves
of
their
civilian
flabbiness
and
acquire
it
these
questions
are
best
answered
autobiographically
here
briefly
is
the
story
of
the
growth
of
the
vision
within
myself
in
august
three
days
after
war
had
been
declared
i
sailed
from
quebec
for
england
on
the
first
ship
that
put
out
from
canada
the
trip
had
been
long
planned
it
was
not
undertaken
from
any
patriotic
motive
my
family
which
included
my
father
mother
sister
and
brother
had
been
living
in
america
for
eight
years
and
had
never
returned
to
england
together
it
was
the
accomplishing
of
a
dream
long
cherished
which
favourable
circumstances
and
a
sudden
influx
of
money
had
at
last
made
possible
we
had
travelled
three
thousand
miles
from
our
ranch
in
the
rockies
before
the
burst
obstinacy
and
curiosity
combined
made
us
go
on
plus
an
entirely
british
feeling
that
by
crossing
the
atlantic
during
the
crisis
we
be
showing
our
contempt
for
the
germans
we
were
only
informed
that
the
ship
was
going
to
sail
at
the
very
last
moment
and
went
aboard
in
the
evening
the
word
spread
quickly
among
the
crews
of
other
vessels
lying
in
harbour
their
firemen
keen
to
get
back
to
england
and
have
a
whack
at
the
huns
tried
to
board
our
ship
sometimes
by
a
ruse
more
often
by
fighting
one
saw
some
very
pretty
fist
work
that
night
as
he
leant
across
the
rail
wondering
whether
he
ever
reach
the
other
side
there
were
rumours
of
german
warships
waiting
to
catch
us
in
somewhere
towards
midnight
the
stowaways
gave
up
their
attempt
to
force
a
passage
they
squatted
with
their
backs
against
the
sheds
along
the
quayside
singing
patriotic
songs
to
the
accompaniment
of
confidently
asserting
that
they
were
sons
of
the
breed
and
never
never
would
be
slaves
it
was
all
very
amusing
war
seemed
to
be
the
finest
of
excuses
for
an
outburst
of
high
spirits
next
morning
when
we
came
on
deck
for
a
breath
of
air
the
vessel
was
under
way
all
hands
were
hard
at
work
disguising
her
with
paint
of
a
sombre
colour
here
and
there
you
saw
an
officer
in
uniform
who
had
not
yet
had
time
to
unpack
his
mufti
the
next
night
and
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
all
were
darkened
and
we
ran
without
lights
an
atmosphere
of
suspense
became
omnipresent
rumours
spread
like
of
sinkings
victories
defeats
marching
and
countermarchings
engagements
on
land
and
water
with
the
uncanny
and
unaccustomed
sense
of
danger
we
began
to
realise
that
we
as
individuals
were
involved
in
a
european
war
as
we
got
about
among
the
passengers
we
found
that
the
usual
spirit
of
comradeship
which
marks
an
atlantic
voyage
was
noticeably
lacking
every
person
regarded
every
other
person
with
distrust
as
though
he
might
be
a
spy
people
were
secretive
as
to
their
calling
and
the
purpose
of
their
voyage
little
by
little
we
discovered
that
many
of
them
were
government
officials
but
that
most
were
professional
soldiers
rushing
back
in
the
hope
that
they
might
be
in
time
to
join
the
british
expeditionary
force
long
before
we
had
guessed
that
a
world
tragedy
was
impending
they
had
judged
war
advent
certain
from
its
shadow
and
had
come
from
the
most
distant
parts
of
canada
that
they
might
be
ready
to
embark
the
moment
the
cloud
burst
some
of
them
were
travelling
with
their
wives
and
children
what
struck
me
as
wholly
unreasonable
was
that
these
professional
soldiers
and
their
families
were
the
least
disturbed
people
on
board
i
used
to
watch
them
as
one
might
watch
condemned
prisoners
in
their
cells
their
apparent
indifference
was
unintelligible
to
me
they
lived
their
daily
present
contented
and
unruffled
just
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
their
present
always
i
accused
them
of
being
lacking
in
imagination
i
saw
them
lying
dead
on
battlefields
i
saw
them
dragging
on
into
old
age
with
the
spine
of
life
broken
mutilated
and
mauled
i
saw
them
in
desperately
tight
corners
fighting
in
ruined
villages
with
sword
and
bayonet
but
they
joked
laughed
played
with
their
kiddies
and
seemed
to
have
no
realisation
of
the
horrors
to
which
they
were
going
there
was
a
aviator
who
had
gone
back
on
his
marriage
promise
that
he
would
abandon
his
aerial
adventures
he
was
hurrying
to
join
the
french
flying
corps
he
and
his
young
wife
used
to
play
every
morning
as
lightheartedly
as
if
they
were
travelling
to
europe
for
a
lark
in
my
many
accusations
of
these
indifference
i
never
accused
them
of
courage
courage
as
i
had
thought
of
it
up
to
that
time
was
a
grim
affair
of
teeth
set
sad
eyes
and
clenched
hands
the
kind
of
my
head
is
bloody
but
unbowed
determination
described
in
henley
poem
when
we
had
arrived
safe
in
port
we
were
held
up
for
some
time
a
tug
came
out
bringing
a
lot
of
artificers
who
at
once
set
to
work
tearing
out
the
fittings
of
the
ship
that
she
might
be
converted
into
a
transport
here
again
i
witnessed
a
contrast
between
the
soldierly
and
the
civilian
attitude
the
civilians
with
their
easily
postponed
engagements
fumed
and
fretted
at
the
delay
in
getting
ashore
the
officers
took
the
inconvenience
with
philosophical
while
the
panelling
and
fittings
were
being
ripped
out
they
sat
among
the
debris
and
played
cards
there
was
heaps
of
time
for
their
appointment
it
was
only
with
wounds
and
death
to
me
as
a
civilian
their
coolness
was
almost
irritating
and
totally
incomprehensible
i
found
a
new
explanation
by
saying
that
after
all
war
was
their
professional
chance
in
fact
exactly
what
a
shortage
in
the
was
to
a
man
who
had
quantities
of
wheat
on
hand
that
night
we
travelled
to
london
arriving
about
two
in
the
morning
there
was
little
to
denote
that
a
european
war
was
on
except
that
people
were
a
trifle
more
animated
and
cheerful
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
we
motored
round
hampstead
heath
the
heath
was
as
usual
gay
with
and
the
streets
sedate
with
on
monday
when
we
tried
to
transact
business
and
exchange
money
we
found
that
there
were
hitches
and
difficulties
it
was
more
as
though
a
window
had
been
left
open
and
a
certain
untidiness
had
resulted
it
will
be
all
right
tomorrow
everybody
said
business
as
usual
and
they
nodded
but
as
the
days
passed
it
was
all
right
kitchener
began
to
call
for
his
army
belgium
was
invaded
we
began
to
hear
about
atrocities
there
were
rumours
of
defeat
which
ceased
to
be
rumours
and
of
grey
hordes
pressing
towards
paris
it
began
to
dawn
on
the
most
optimistic
of
us
that
the
little
british
army
the
old
contemptibles
had
gone
to
france
on
a
holiday
jaunt
the
sternness
of
the
hour
was
brought
home
to
me
by
one
obscure
incident
straggling
across
trafalgar
square
in
mufti
and
commanded
by
a
sergeant
came
a
little
procession
of
recruits
they
were
roughly
dressed
men
of
the
navy
and
the
coster
class
all
save
one
carried
under
his
arm
his
worldly
possessions
wrapped
in
cloth
or
anything
that
had
come
handy
the
sergeant
kept
on
giving
them
the
step
and
angrily
imploring
them
to
pick
it
up
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
followed
a
woman
she
also
carried
a
package
they
turned
into
the
strand
passed
by
charing
cross
and
branched
off
to
the
right
down
a
lane
to
the
embankment
at
the
point
where
they
left
the
strand
the
man
without
a
parcel
spoke
to
the
sergeant
and
fell
out
of
the
ranks
he
laid
his
clumsy
hand
on
the
woman
arm
she
set
down
on
the
pavement
the
parcel
she
had
been
carrying
there
they
stood
for
a
full
minute
gazing
at
each
other
dumbly
oblivious
to
the
passing
crowds
she
was
pleasing
to
look
at
just
a
slum
woman
with
draggled
skirts
a
shawl
gathered
tightly
round
her
and
a
mildewed
kind
of
bonnet
he
was
no
more
attractive
a
hulking
samson
perhaps
a
who
whilst
he
had
loved
her
had
probably
beaten
her
they
had
come
to
the
hour
of
parting
and
there
they
stood
in
the
london
sunshine
inarticulate
after
life
together
he
glanced
after
the
procession
it
was
two
hundred
yards
away
by
now
stooping
awkwardly
for
the
burden
which
she
had
carried
for
him
in
a
kind
of
way
he
kissed
her
then
broke
from
her
to
follow
his
companions
she
watched
him
forlornly
her
hands
hanging
empty
never
once
did
he
look
back
as
he
departed
catching
up
he
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
they
rounded
a
corner
and
were
lost
her
eyes
were
quite
dry
her
jaw
sagged
stupidly
for
some
seconds
she
stared
after
the
way
he
had
gone
then
she
wandered
off
as
one
who
had
no
purpose
wounded
men
commenced
to
appear
in
the
streets
you
saw
them
in
restaurants
looking
happy
and
embarrassed
being
paraded
by
proud
families
one
day
i
met
two
in
my
tailor
shop
one
had
an
arm
in
a
sling
the
other
head
had
been
seared
by
a
bullet
it
was
whispered
that
they
were
officers
who
had
got
it
at
mons
a
thrill
ran
through
me
a
thrill
of
at
the
empire
music
hall
in
leicester
square
tragedy
bared
its
broken
teeth
and
mouthed
at
me
we
had
reached
the
stage
at
which
we
had
become
intensely
patriotic
by
the
singing
of
songs
a
beautiful
actress
who
had
no
thought
of
doing
her
bit
herself
attired
as
britannia
with
a
colossal
union
jack
for
background
came
before
the
footlights
and
sang
the
recruiting
song
of
the
moment
we
do
want
to
lose
you
but
we
think
you
ought
to
some
one
else
recited
a
poem
calculated
to
shame
men
into
immediate
enlistment
two
lines
of
which
i
remember
i
was
among
the
first
to
go
but
i
went
thank
god
i
the
effect
of
such
urging
was
to
make
me
angry
i
was
going
to
be
rushed
into
khaki
on
the
spur
of
an
emotion
picked
up
in
a
i
pictured
the
comfortable
gentlemen
beyond
the
military
age
who
had
written
these
heroic
taunts
had
gained
reputation
by
so
doing
and
all
the
time
sat
at
home
in
suburban
security
the
people
who
recited
or
sung
their
effusions
made
me
equally
angry
they
were
making
a
means
of
livelihood
and
had
no
intention
of
doing
their
part
all
the
world
that
by
reason
of
age
or
sex
was
exempt
from
the
ordeal
of
battle
was
shoving
behind
all
the
rest
of
the
world
that
was
not
exempt
using
the
younger
men
as
a
shield
against
his
own
terror
and
at
the
same
time
calling
them
cowards
that
was
how
i
felt
i
told
myself
that
if
i
went
and
the
seemed
very
remote
i
should
go
on
a
conviction
and
not
because
of
shoving
they
could
hand
me
as
many
white
feathers
as
they
liked
i
was
going
to
be
swept
away
by
the
general
hysteria
besides
where
would
be
the
sense
in
joining
everybody
said
that
our
fellows
would
be
home
for
christmas
our
chaps
who
were
out
there
ought
to
know
in
writing
home
they
promised
it
themselves
the
next
part
of
the
performance
was
moving
pictures
of
the
germans
march
into
brussels
i
was
in
the
promenade
and
had
noticed
a
belgian
soldier
being
made
much
of
by
a
group
of
tommies
he
was
a
queer
looking
fellow
with
a
dazed
expression
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
focus
on
some
distant
horror
his
uniform
was
faded
and
torn
evidently
it
had
seen
active
service
i
wondered
by
what
strange
fortune
he
had
been
conveyed
from
the
brutalities
of
invasion
to
this
gilded
in
leicester
square
i
watched
the
screen
through
ghastly
photographic
boulevards
the
spectre
conquerors
marched
they
came
on
endlessly
as
though
somewhere
out
of
sight
a
human
dam
had
burst
whose
deluge
would
never
be
stopped
i
tried
to
catch
the
expressions
of
the
men
wondering
whether
this
or
that
or
the
next
had
contributed
his
toll
of
violated
women
and
butchered
children
to
the
list
of
hun
atrocities
suddenly
the
silence
of
the
theatre
was
startled
by
a
low
infuriated
growl
followed
by
a
shriek
which
was
hardly
human
i
have
since
heard
the
same
kind
of
sounds
when
the
stumps
of
the
mutilated
are
being
dressed
and
the
pain
has
become
intolerable
everybody
turned
in
their
seats
gazing
through
the
dimness
to
a
point
in
the
promenade
near
to
where
i
was
the
ghosts
on
the
screen
were
forgotten
the
faked
patriotism
of
the
songs
we
had
listened
to
had
become
a
thing
of
naught
through
the
welter
of
bombast
excitement
and
emotion
we
had
grounded
on
reality
the
belgian
soldier
in
his
tattered
uniform
was
leaning
out
as
though
to
bridge
the
space
that
divided
him
from
his
ghostly
tormentors
the
dazed
look
was
gone
from
his
expression
and
his
eyes
were
focussed
in
the
fixity
of
a
cruel
purpose
to
kill
and
kill
and
kill
the
hordes
of
tyrants
so
long
as
his
life
should
last
he
shrieked
imprecations
at
them
calling
upon
god
and
snatching
epithets
from
the
gutter
in
his
furious
endeavour
to
curse
them
he
was
dragged
away
by
friends
in
khaki
overpowered
struggling
smothered
but
still
cursing
i
learnt
afterwards
that
he
with
his
mother
and
two
brothers
had
been
the
proprietors
of
one
of
the
best
hotels
in
brussels
both
his
brothers
had
been
called
to
arms
and
were
dead
anything
might
have
happened
to
his
mother
he
had
not
heard
from
her
he
himself
had
escaped
in
the
general
retreat
and
was
going
back
to
france
as
interpreter
with
an
english
regiment
he
had
lost
everything
it
was
the
sight
of
his
ruined
hotel
flung
by
chance
on
the
screen
that
had
provoked
his
demonstration
he
was
dead
to
every
emotion
except
revenge
to
accomplish
which
he
was
returning
the
still
went
on
nobody
had
the
heart
to
see
more
of
them
the
house
rose
fumbling
for
its
coats
and
hats
the
place
was
soon
empty
just
as
i
was
leaving
a
recruiting
sergeant
touched
my
elbow
going
to
enlist
sonny
i
shook
my
head
not
want
to
think
it
you
will
he
said
do
wait
too
long
we
can
make
a
man
of
you
if
i
get
you
in
my
squad
i
give
you
i
did
doubt
it
i
do
know
that
i
telling
these
events
in
their
proper
sequence
as
they
led
up
to
the
growing
of
the
vision
that
does
matter
the
point
is
that
the
conviction
was
daily
strengthening
that
i
was
needed
out
there
the
thought
was
grotesque
that
i
could
ever
make
a
soldier
i
whose
life
from
the
day
of
leaving
college
had
been
almost
wholly
sedentary
in
fights
at
school
i
could
never
hurt
the
other
boy
until
by
pain
he
had
stung
me
into
madness
moreover
my
idea
of
war
was
grimly
graphic
i
thought
it
consisted
of
a
choice
between
inserting
a
bayonet
into
some
one
else
stomach
or
being
yourself
the
recipient
i
had
no
conception
of
the
anonymous
killing
that
marks
our
modern
methods
and
is
in
many
respects
more
truly
awful
it
a
fact
that
there
are
hosts
of
combatants
who
have
never
once
identified
the
bodies
of
those
for
whose
death
they
are
personally
responsible
my
ideas
of
fighting
were
all
of
encounters
the
kind
of
bloody
fighting
that
rejoiced
the
hearts
of
pirates
i
considered
that
it
took
a
brutal
kind
of
man
to
do
such
work
for
myself
i
felt
certain
that
though
i
got
the
of
a
fellow
who
had
tried
to
murder
me
i
should
never
have
the
callousness
to
return
the
compliment
the
thought
of
shedding
blood
was
nauseating
it
was
partly
to
escape
from
this
atmosphere
of
tension
that
we
left
london
and
set
out
on
a
through
england
this
trip
had
figured
largely
in
our
original
plans
before
there
had
been
any
thought
of
war
we
wanted
to
the
old
places
that
had
been
the
scenes
of
our
and
childhood
months
before
sailing
out
of
quebec
we
had
studied
guidebooks
mapping
out
routes
and
hotels
with
about
half
a
ton
of
gasolene
on
the
roof
to
guard
against
contingencies
we
started
everywhere
we
went
from
cornwall
to
the
north
men
were
training
and
marching
all
the
bridges
and
reservoirs
were
guarded
every
tiniest
village
had
its
recruiting
posters
for
kitchener
army
it
was
a
trip
utterly
different
from
the
one
we
had
expected
at
stratford
in
the
of
shakespeare
favourite
tavern
i
met
an
exceptional
person
a
man
who
was
afraid
and
had
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
as
millions
at
that
time
felt
it
an
american
was
present
a
vast
and
fleshy
man
a
transatlantic
version
of
falstaff
he
had
just
escaped
from
paris
and
was
giving
us
an
account
of
how
he
had
hired
a
car
had
driven
as
near
the
as
he
could
get
and
had
seen
the
wounded
coming
out
he
had
risked
the
driver
life
and
expended
large
sums
of
money
merely
to
gratify
his
curiosity
he
mopped
his
brow
and
told
us
that
he
had
aged
ten
years
folks
in
philadelphia
would
hardly
know
him
but
it
was
all
worth
it
the
details
which
he
embroidered
and
dwelt
upon
were
ghastly
he
was
particularly
impressed
with
having
seen
a
man
with
his
nose
off
his
description
held
us
horrified
and
in
the
midst
of
his
oratory
an
officer
entered
bringing
with
him
five
nervous
young
fellows
they
were
excited
and
belonged
to
the
class
of
the
lawyer
clerk
the
officer
had
evidently
been
working
them
up
to
the
point
of
enlistment
and
hoped
to
complete
the
job
that
evening
over
a
sociable
glass
as
his
audience
swelled
the
fat
man
from
philadelphia
grew
exceedingly
vivid
when
appealed
to
by
the
recruiting
officer
he
confirmed
the
opinion
that
every
englishman
of
fighting
age
should
be
in
france
that
where
the
boys
of
america
would
be
if
their
country
were
in
the
same
predicament
four
out
of
the
five
intended
victims
applauded
this
sentiment
they
applauded
too
boisterously
for
complete
sincerity
because
they
felt
that
they
could
do
no
less
the
fifth
a
scholarly
fellow
drew
attention
to
himself
by
his
silence
you
going
to
join
too
are
you
the
recruiting
officer
asked
the
man
swallowed
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
scared
the
american
morbid
details
had
been
enough
to
frighten
anybody
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
had
the
pluck
to
tell
the
truth
i
like
to
he
hesitated
but
i
got
an
imagination
i
should
see
things
as
twice
as
horrible
i
should
live
through
every
beastliness
before
it
occurred
when
it
did
happen
i
should
turn
coward
i
should
run
away
and
you
shoot
me
as
a
deserter
like
not
yet
i
he
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
that
night
if
he
still
alive
he
probably
wears
decorations
he
was
afraid
just
as
every
one
else
was
afraid
but
he
was
sufficiently
a
coward
to
lie
about
his
terror
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
millions
at
that
hour
a
day
came
when
england
jeopardy
was
brought
home
to
her
i
remember
the
date
but
i
remember
it
was
a
sabbath
we
had
pulled
up
before
a
village
post
office
to
get
the
news
it
was
pasted
behind
the
window
against
the
glass
we
read
has
the
news
was
false
but
it
was
contradicted
till
next
day
meanwhile
in
that
quiet
village
over
and
above
the
purring
of
the
engine
we
heard
the
beat
of
death
wings
across
the
channel
a
gigantic
vulture
approaching
which
would
pick
clean
of
vileness
the
bones
of
both
the
actually
and
the
spiritually
dead
i
knew
then
for
certain
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
till
i
too
should
be
out
there
among
the
carnage
somewhere
in
i
felt
like
a
rabbit
in
the
last
of
the
standing
corn
when
a
field
is
in
the
harvesting
there
was
no
escape
i
could
hear
the
scythes
of
an
inexorable
duty
cutting
closer
after
about
six
weeks
in
england
i
travelled
back
to
new
york
with
my
family
to
complete
certain
financial
obligations
and
to
set
about
the
winding
up
of
my
affairs
i
said
nothing
to
any
one
as
to
my
purpose
the
reason
for
my
silence
is
now
obvious
i
did
want
to
commit
myself
to
other
people
and
wished
to
leave
myself
a
for
retracting
the
promises
i
had
made
my
conscience
there
were
times
when
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
appalled
by
the
future
which
i
was
rapidly
approaching
my
vivid
imagination
which
from
childhood
has
been
as
much
a
hindrance
as
a
help
made
me
foresee
myself
in
every
situation
of
horror
gassed
broken
distributed
over
the
landscape
luckily
it
made
me
foresee
the
worst
horror
the
ignominy
of
living
perhaps
fifty
years
with
a
self
who
was
dishonoured
and
had
sunk
beneath
his
own
best
standards
of
course
there
were
also
moments
of
exaltation
when
the
of
adventure
loomed
large
it
seemed
splendidly
absurd
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
soldier
a
of
those
lordly
chaps
who
had
fought
at
senlac
sailed
with
drake
and
saved
the
day
for
freedom
at
mons
whether
i
was
exalted
or
depressed
a
power
stronger
than
myself
urged
me
to
work
feverishly
to
the
end
that
at
the
first
opportunity
i
might
lay
aside
my
occupation
with
all
my
civilian
obligations
discharged
when
that
time
came
my
first
difficulty
was
in
communicating
my
decision
to
my
family
my
second
in
getting
accepted
in
canada
i
was
perhaps
more
ignorant
than
most
people
about
things
military
i
had
not
the
slightest
knowledge
as
to
the
functions
of
the
different
arms
of
the
service
infantry
artillery
engineers
they
all
connoted
just
as
much
and
as
little
i
had
no
qualifications
i
had
never
handled
my
solitary
useful
accomplishment
was
that
i
could
ride
a
horse
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
man
ever
was
less
fitted
for
the
profession
of
killing
i
was
painfully
conscious
of
whenever
i
offered
myself
for
the
job
i
offered
myself
several
times
and
in
different
quarters
when
at
last
i
was
granted
a
commission
in
the
canadian
field
artillery
it
was
by
pure
i
did
even
know
what
guns
were
used
and
if
informed
should
have
had
the
least
idea
what
an
was
nevertheless
within
seven
months
i
was
out
in
france
taking
part
in
an
offensive
which
up
to
that
time
was
the
most
ambitious
of
the
entire
war
from
new
york
i
went
to
kingston
in
ontario
to
present
myself
for
training
an
officers
class
had
just
started
in
which
i
had
been
ordered
to
enrol
myself
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
an
unusually
hard
winter
even
for
that
part
of
canada
my
first
glimpse
of
the
tête
du
pont
barracks
was
of
a
square
of
low
buildings
very
much
like
the
square
of
a
hudson
bay
fort
the
parade
ground
was
in
trampled
snow
and
mud
a
bleak
wind
was
blowing
from
off
the
river
squads
of
embryo
officers
were
being
drilled
by
sergeants
the
officers
looked
cold
and
cowed
and
foolish
the
sergeants
employed
ruthlessly
the
army
sarcasms
and
made
no
effort
to
disguise
their
disgust
for
these
officers
and
temporary
i
was
directed
to
an
office
where
a
captain
sat
writing
at
a
desk
while
an
orderly
waited
rigidly
at
attention
the
captain
looked
up
as
i
entered
took
in
my
spats
and
velour
hat
with
an
impatient
glance
and
continued
with
his
writing
when
i
got
an
opportunity
i
presented
my
letter
he
read
it
through
irritably
any
previous
military
experience
none
at
then
how
expect
to
pass
out
with
this
class
it
been
going
for
nearly
two
weeks
already
again
as
though
he
had
dismissed
me
from
his
mind
he
returned
to
his
writing
from
a
military
standpoint
i
knew
that
i
was
justly
a
figure
of
naught
but
i
also
felt
that
he
was
rubbing
it
in
a
trifle
hard
i
was
too
recent
a
recruit
to
have
lost
my
civilian
at
last
after
a
period
of
embarrassed
silence
i
asked
what
am
i
to
do
to
whom
do
i
report
without
looking
up
he
told
me
to
report
on
the
parade
ground
at
six
the
following
morning
when
i
got
back
to
my
hotel
i
reflected
on
the
chilliness
of
my
reception
i
had
taken
no
credit
to
myself
for
enlisting
i
knew
that
i
ought
to
have
joined
months
before
but
six
i
glanced
across
at
the
station
where
trains
were
pulling
out
for
new
york
for
a
moment
i
was
tempted
but
not
for
long
i
could
trust
the
hotel
people
to
wake
me
so
i
went
out
and
purchased
an
alarm
clock
that
night
i
did
sleep
much
i
was
up
and
dressed
by
i
hid
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
wall
near
the
barracks
and
struck
matches
to
look
at
my
watch
at
ten
minutes
to
six
the
street
was
full
of
unseen
hurrying
feet
which
sounded
ghostly
in
the
darkness
i
followed
them
into
the
the
parade
was
falling
in
rolls
were
being
called
by
the
aid
of
i
caught
hold
of
an
officer
for
all
i
knew
he
might
have
been
a
general
or
colonel
i
asked
his
advice
when
i
had
blundered
out
my
story
he
laughed
and
said
i
had
better
return
to
my
hotel
the
class
was
going
to
stables
and
there
was
no
one
at
that
hour
to
whom
i
could
report
the
words
of
the
sergeant
at
the
empire
came
back
to
me
and
give
you
hell
if
i
get
you
in
my
i
understood
then
this
was
the
first
attempt
of
the
army
to
break
my
heart
an
attempt
often
repeated
and
an
attempt
for
which
from
my
present
point
of
vantage
i
am
intensely
grateful
in
those
days
the
canadian
overseas
forces
were
comprised
of
volunteers
it
was
sufficient
to
express
a
tepid
willingness
to
die
for
your
country
you
had
to
prove
yourself
determined
and
eligible
for
death
through
your
power
to
endure
hardship
when
i
had
been
medically
examined
passed
as
fit
had
donned
a
uniform
and
commenced
my
training
i
learnt
what
the
enduring
of
hardship
was
no
experience
on
active
service
has
equalled
the
humiliation
and
severity
of
those
first
months
of
soldiering
we
were
sneered
at
cleaned
stables
groomed
horses
rode
stripped
saddle
for
twelve
miles
at
the
trot
attended
lectures
studied
till
past
midnight
and
were
up
on
first
parade
at
six
no
previous
civilian
efficiency
or
prominence
stood
us
in
any
stead
we
started
robbed
of
all
importance
and
only
gained
a
new
importance
by
our
power
to
hang
on
and
to
develop
a
new
efficiency
as
soldiers
when
men
went
sick
they
were
labelled
scrimshankers
and
struck
off
the
course
it
was
an
offence
to
let
your
body
interfere
with
your
duty
if
it
tried
to
you
must
ignore
it
if
a
man
caught
cold
in
kingston
what
would
he
not
catch
in
the
trenches
very
many
went
down
under
the
physical
ordeal
of
the
class
that
started
i
do
think
more
than
a
third
passed
the
lukewarm
soldier
and
the
hero
who
simply
wanted
to
swank
in
a
uniform
were
effectually
choked
off
it
was
a
test
of
pluck
even
more
than
of
strength
or
intelligence
the
same
test
that
a
man
would
be
subjected
to
all
the
time
at
the
front
in
a
word
it
sorted
out
the
fellows
who
had
guts
is
a
particularly
polite
word
but
i
have
come
increasingly
to
appreciate
its
splendid
significance
the
possessor
of
this
much
coveted
quality
is
the
kind
of
idiot
who
when
his
legs
are
smitten
off
will
fight
upon
his
the
tommies
whom
we
were
going
to
command
would
be
like
that
if
we
were
like
it
we
would
be
any
good
as
officers
this
artillery
school
had
a
violent
way
of
sifting
out
a
man
moral
worth
you
had
much
conceit
left
by
the
end
of
it
i
had
not
felt
myself
so
paltry
since
the
day
when
i
was
left
at
my
first
in
knickerbockers
after
one
had
qualified
and
been
appointed
to
a
battery
there
was
still
difficulty
in
getting
to
england
i
was
lucky
and
went
over
early
with
a
draft
of
officers
who
had
been
cabled
for
as
reinforcements
i
had
been
in
england
a
bare
three
weeks
when
my
name
was
posted
as
due
to
go
to
france
how
did
i
feel
nervous
of
course
but
also
intensely
eager
i
may
have
been
afraid
of
wounds
and
death
i
do
remember
i
was
certainly
nothing
like
as
afraid
as
i
had
been
before
i
wore
uniform
my
chief
fear
was
that
i
would
be
afraid
and
might
show
it
like
the
chap
in
the
at
stratford
i
had
fleeting
glimpses
of
myself
being
shot
as
a
deserter
at
this
point
something
happened
which
at
least
proved
to
me
that
i
had
made
moral
progress
i
finished
my
packing
and
was
doing
a
last
rush
round
when
i
caught
in
large
lettering
on
a
newsboard
the
heading
peace
before
i
realised
what
had
happened
i
was
crying
i
was
furious
with
disappointment
if
the
war
should
end
before
i
got
there
on
buying
a
paper
i
assured
myself
that
such
a
disaster
was
quite
improbable
i
breathed
again
then
the
reproachful
memory
came
of
another
occasion
when
i
had
been
scared
by
a
headline
boulogne
has
i
had
been
scared
lest
i
might
be
needed
at
that
time
now
i
was
lest
i
might
arrive
too
late
there
was
a
change
in
me
something
had
happened
i
got
to
thinking
about
it
on
that
through
england
i
had
considered
myself
in
the
light
of
a
philanthropist
who
might
come
to
the
help
of
the
allies
and
might
not
now
all
i
asked
was
to
be
considered
worthy
to
do
my
infinitesimal
i
had
lost
all
my
old
conceits
and
hallucinations
and
had
come
to
respect
myself
in
a
very
humble
fashion
not
for
what
i
was
but
for
the
cause
in
which
i
was
prepared
to
fight
the
knowledge
that
i
belonged
to
the
physically
fit
contributed
to
this
saner
sense
of
pride
before
i
wore
a
uniform
i
had
had
the
morbid
fear
that
i
might
not
be
up
to
standard
and
then
the
uniform
it
was
the
outward
symbol
of
the
lost
selfishness
and
the
cleaner
honour
it
had
been
paid
for
it
would
be
paid
for
till
i
had
lived
in
the
trenches
i
was
childishly
anxious
to
earn
my
right
to
wear
it
i
had
said
to
myself
and
had
been
into
willing
sacrifice
i
think
that
was
the
reason
for
the
difference
of
spirit
in
which
i
read
the
two
headlines
we
all
gone
through
the
same
spiritual
gradations
we
men
who
have
got
to
the
front
none
of
us
know
how
to
express
our
conversion
all
we
know
is
that
from
being
little
circumscribed
egoists
we
have
swamped
our
identities
in
a
magnanimous
crusade
the
venture
looked
fatal
at
first
but
in
losing
the
whole
world
we
have
gained
our
own
souls
on
a
beautiful
day
in
late
summer
i
sailed
for
france
england
faded
out
like
a
dream
behind
through
the
haze
in
a
hospital
ship
came
racing
on
her
sides
were
blazoned
the
scarlet
cross
the
next
time
i
came
to
england
i
might
travel
on
that
racing
ship
the
truth
sounded
like
a
lie
it
seemed
far
more
true
that
i
was
going
on
my
annual
pleasure
trip
to
the
lazy
cities
of
romance
the
port
at
which
we
disembarked
was
cheery
and
almost
normal
one
saw
a
lot
of
khaki
mingling
with
of
france
apart
from
that
one
would
scarcely
have
guessed
that
the
greatest
war
in
the
world
history
was
raging
not
more
than
fifty
miles
away
i
slept
the
night
at
a
comfortable
hotel
on
the
quayside
there
was
no
apparent
shortage
i
got
everything
that
i
required
next
day
i
boarded
a
train
which
i
was
told
would
carry
me
to
the
front
we
puffed
along
in
a
leisurely
sort
of
way
the
engineer
seemed
to
halt
whenever
he
had
a
mind
no
matter
where
he
halted
grubby
children
miraculously
appeared
and
ran
along
the
bank
demanding
from
monsieur
engleeshman
ceegarettes
and
towards
evening
we
pulled
up
at
a
little
town
where
we
had
a
most
excellent
meal
no
hint
of
war
yet
night
came
down
and
we
found
that
our
carriage
had
no
lights
it
must
have
been
nearing
dawn
when
i
was
wakened
by
the
distant
thunder
of
guns
i
crouched
in
my
corner
cold
and
cramped
trying
to
visualise
the
terror
of
it
i
asked
myself
whether
i
was
afraid
not
of
death
i
told
myself
but
of
being
afraid
yes
most
at
five
we
halted
at
a
junction
where
a
from
the
front
was
already
at
a
standstill
tommies
in
steel
helmets
and
muddied
to
the
eyes
were
swarming
out
onto
the
tracks
they
looked
terrible
men
with
their
tanned
cheeks
and
haggard
eyes
i
felt
how
impractical
i
was
as
i
watched
them
how
for
campaigning
they
were
making
the
most
of
their
respite
from
travelling
some
were
building
little
fires
between
the
ties
to
do
their
cooking
their
utensils
were
bayonets
and
old
tomato
cans
others
were
collecting
water
from
the
exhaust
of
an
engine
and
shaving
i
had
already
tried
to
purchase
food
and
had
failed
so
i
copied
their
example
and
set
about
shaving
later
in
the
day
we
passed
gangs
of
hun
prisoners
clumsy
looking
fellows
with
flaxen
hair
and
blue
eyes
who
seemed
to
be
thanking
god
every
minute
with
smiles
that
they
were
out
of
danger
and
on
our
side
of
the
line
late
in
the
afternoon
the
engine
jumped
the
rails
we
were
advised
to
wander
off
to
a
the
direction
of
which
was
sketchily
indicated
we
found
some
australians
with
a
and
persuaded
them
to
help
us
with
our
baggage
it
had
been
pouring
heavily
but
the
clouds
had
dispersed
and
a
rainbow
spanned
the
sky
i
took
it
for
a
sign
after
trudging
about
six
miles
we
arrived
at
the
camp
and
found
that
it
was
out
of
food
and
that
all
the
tents
were
occupied
we
stretched
our
on
the
ground
and
went
to
bed
supperless
we
had
had
no
food
all
day
next
morning
we
were
told
that
we
ought
to
jump
an
if
we
wanted
to
get
any
further
on
our
journey
nobody
seemed
to
want
us
particularly
and
no
one
could
give
us
the
least
information
as
to
where
our
division
was
it
was
another
lesson
if
that
were
needed
of
our
total
unimportance
while
we
were
waiting
on
the
roadside
an
australian
brigade
of
artillery
passed
by
the
men
faces
were
dreary
with
fatigue
the
gunners
were
dismounted
and
marched
as
in
a
trance
the
harness
was
muddy
the
steel
rusty
the
horses
lean
and
discouraged
we
understood
that
they
were
pulling
out
from
an
offensive
in
which
they
had
received
a
bad
cutting
up
to
my
overstrained
imagination
it
seemed
that
the
men
had
the
vision
of
death
in
their
eyes
presently
we
spotted
a
who
had
what
george
robey
would
call
a
kind
and
generous
we
took
advantage
of
him
for
once
having
persuaded
him
to
give
us
a
lift
we
froze
onto
him
and
made
him
cart
us
about
the
country
all
day
we
kept
him
kind
and
generous
i
regret
to
say
by
buying
him
wine
at
far
too
many
estaminets
towards
evening
the
thunder
of
the
guns
had
swelled
into
an
ominous
roar
we
passed
through
villages
disfigured
by
civilians
became
more
rare
and
more
aged
cattle
disappeared
utterly
from
the
landscape
fields
were
furrowed
with
abandoned
trenches
in
front
of
which
hung
entanglements
of
wire
mounted
orderlies
splashed
along
sullen
roads
at
an
impatient
trot
here
and
there
we
came
across
improvised
bivouacs
of
infantry
far
away
against
the
horizon
towards
which
we
travelled
hun
flares
and
rockets
were
going
up
hopeless
stoicism
unutterable
desolation
that
was
my
first
impression
the
landscape
was
getting
increasingly
muddy
it
became
a
sea
of
mud
on
travelled
warily
with
their
feet
dragging
to
save
themselves
from
falling
everything
was
splashed
with
filth
and
corruption
one
marvelled
at
the
cleanness
of
the
sky
trees
were
blasted
and
seemed
to
be
sinking
out
of
sight
in
this
slough
of
despond
we
came
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
in
the
valley
was
something
that
i
recognised
the
last
time
i
had
seen
it
was
in
an
etching
in
a
shop
window
in
newark
new
jersey
it
was
a
town
from
the
midst
of
whose
battered
ruins
a
splintered
tower
soared
against
the
sky
leaning
far
out
from
the
tower
so
that
it
seemed
she
must
drop
was
a
statue
of
the
virgin
with
the
christ
in
her
arms
it
was
a
superstition
with
the
french
i
remembered
that
so
long
as
she
did
not
fall
things
would
go
well
with
the
allies
as
we
watched
a
shell
screamed
over
the
gaping
roofs
and
a
column
of
smoke
went
up
gehenna
being
blessed
by
the
infant
jesus
that
was
what
i
saw
as
we
entered
the
streets
tommies
more
polluted
than
miners
crept
out
from
the
skeletons
of
houses
they
leant
listlessly
against
sagging
doorways
to
watch
us
pass
if
we
asked
for
information
as
to
where
our
division
was
they
shook
their
heads
stupidly
too
indifferent
with
weariness
to
reply
we
found
the
town
mayor
all
that
he
could
tell
us
was
that
our
division
was
here
yet
but
was
expected
any
day
probably
it
was
still
on
the
line
of
march
our
was
growing
impatient
we
wrote
him
out
a
note
which
would
explain
his
wanderings
got
him
to
deposit
us
near
a
tent
and
bade
him
an
uncordial
for
the
next
three
nights
we
slept
by
our
wits
and
got
our
food
by
foraging
there
was
a
headquarters
near
by
whose
battalion
was
in
the
line
i
struck
up
a
liaison
with
its
officers
and
at
times
went
into
the
crowded
tent
which
was
their
mess
to
get
warm
runners
would
come
there
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
bringing
messages
from
the
front
they
were
usually
well
spent
sometimes
they
had
been
gassed
but
they
all
had
the
invincible
determination
to
carry
on
after
they
had
delivered
their
message
they
would
lie
down
in
the
mud
and
go
to
sleep
like
dogs
the
moment
the
reply
was
ready
they
would
lurch
to
their
feet
throwing
off
their
weariness
as
though
it
were
a
thing
to
be
conquered
and
despised
i
appreciated
now
as
never
before
the
lesson
of
guts
that
i
had
been
taught
at
kingston
there
was
one
officer
at
battalion
headquarters
who
whenever
i
entered
was
always
writing
writing
writing
what
he
was
writing
i
never
enquired
perhaps
letters
to
his
sweetheart
or
wife
it
matter
how
long
i
stayed
he
never
seemed
to
have
the
time
to
look
up
he
was
a
highlander
a
big
man
with
a
look
of
fate
in
his
eyes
his
hair
was
black
his
face
stern
and
set
and
extremely
white
i
remember
once
seeing
him
long
after
midnight
through
the
raised
flap
of
the
tent
all
his
brother
officers
were
asleep
huddled
like
sacks
impersonally
on
the
floor
at
the
table
in
the
centre
he
sat
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
the
light
from
the
lamp
spilling
over
his
neck
and
forehead
he
may
have
been
praying
he
recalled
to
my
mind
the
famous
picture
of
the
last
sleep
of
argyle
from
that
moment
i
had
the
premonition
that
he
would
not
live
long
a
month
later
i
learnt
that
he
had
been
killed
on
his
next
trip
into
the
trenches
after
three
days
of
waiting
my
division
arrived
and
i
was
attached
to
a
battery
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
new
companions
when
we
pulled
into
my
first
attack
we
hooked
in
at
dawn
and
set
out
through
a
dense
white
mist
the
mist
was
wet
and
miserable
but
excellent
for
our
purpose
it
prevented
us
from
being
spotted
by
enemy
balloons
and
aeroplanes
we
made
all
the
haste
that
was
possible
but
in
places
the
roads
were
blocked
by
other
batteries
moving
into
new
positions
we
passed
through
the
town
above
which
the
virgin
floated
with
the
infant
jesus
in
her
arms
one
wondered
whether
she
was
really
holding
him
out
to
bless
her
attitude
might
equally
have
been
that
of
one
who
was
flinging
him
down
into
the
shambles
disgusted
with
this
travesty
on
religion
the
other
side
of
the
town
the
ravages
of
war
were
far
more
marked
all
the
way
along
the
roadside
were
clumps
of
little
crosses
french
english
german
planted
above
the
hurried
graves
of
the
brave
fellows
who
had
fallen
ambulances
were
picking
their
way
warily
returning
with
the
last
night
toll
of
wounded
we
saw
newly
dead
men
and
horses
pulled
to
one
side
who
had
been
caught
in
the
darkness
by
the
enemy
harassing
fire
in
places
the
country
had
holes
the
size
of
quarries
where
mines
had
exploded
and
shells
from
large
calibre
guns
had
detonated
bedlam
was
raging
up
front
shells
went
screaming
over
us
seeking
out
victims
in
the
to
have
been
there
by
oneself
would
have
been
most
disturbing
but
the
men
about
me
seemed
to
regard
it
as
perfectly
ordinary
and
normal
i
steadied
myself
by
their
example
we
came
to
a
point
where
our
major
was
waiting
for
us
turned
out
of
the
road
followed
him
down
a
grass
slope
and
so
into
a
valley
here
were
in
the
process
of
construction
guns
were
unhooked
and
into
their
positions
and
the
teams
sent
back
to
the
all
day
we
worked
both
officers
and
men
with
pick
and
shovel
towards
evening
we
had
completed
the
and
made
a
beginning
on
the
overhead
cover
we
had
had
no
time
to
prepare
so
spread
our
and
blankets
in
the
trenches
about
seven
as
we
were
resting
the
evening
hate
commenced
in
those
days
the
evening
hate
was
a
regular
habit
with
the
hun
he
knew
our
country
better
than
we
did
for
he
had
retired
from
it
every
evening
he
used
to
search
out
all
communication
trenches
and
likely
with
any
quantity
of
shells
his
idea
was
to
rob
us
of
our
i
wish
he
might
have
seen
how
abysmally
he
failed
to
do
it
down
our
narrow
valley
like
a
flight
of
arrows
the
shells
screamed
and
whistled
where
they
struck
the
ground
looked
like
resurrection
day
with
the
dead
elbowing
their
way
into
daylight
and
forcing
back
the
earth
from
their
eyes
there
were
actually
many
dead
just
beneath
the
surface
and
as
the
ground
was
ploughed
up
the
smell
of
corruption
became
distinctly
unpleasant
presently
the
shells
began
to
go
dud
we
realised
that
they
were
a
thin
bluish
vapour
spread
throughout
the
valley
and
breathing
became
oppressive
then
like
stallions
kicking
in
their
stalls
the
heavy
guns
on
the
ridge
above
us
opened
it
was
fine
to
hear
them
stamping
their
defiance
it
made
one
want
to
get
to
grips
with
his
aggressors
in
the
brief
silences
one
could
hear
our
chaps
laughing
the
danger
seemed
to
fill
them
with
a
wild
excitement
every
time
a
shell
came
near
and
missed
them
they
would
taunt
the
unseen
huns
for
their
poor
gunnery
giving
what
they
considered
the
necessary
corrections
five
minutes
more
left
old
cock
if
only
drop
fifty
you
get
these
men
did
know
what
fear
was
or
if
they
did
they
kept
it
to
themselves
and
these
were
the
chaps
whom
i
was
to
order
a
few
days
later
my
major
told
me
that
i
was
to
be
ready
at
next
morning
to
accompany
him
up
front
to
register
the
guns
in
registering
guns
you
take
a
telephonist
and
linesmen
with
you
they
lay
in
a
line
from
the
battery
to
any
point
you
may
select
as
the
best
from
which
to
observe
the
enemy
country
this
point
may
be
two
miles
or
more
in
advance
of
your
battery
your
battery
is
always
hidden
and
out
of
sight
for
fear
the
enemy
should
see
the
flash
of
the
firing
consequently
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
battery
lays
the
guns
mathematically
but
can
not
observe
the
effect
of
his
shots
the
officer
who
goes
forward
can
see
the
target
by
telephoning
back
his
corrections
he
makes
himself
the
eyes
of
the
officer
at
the
guns
it
had
been
raining
when
we
crept
out
of
our
kennels
to
go
forward
it
seems
unnecessary
to
state
that
it
had
been
raining
for
it
always
has
been
raining
at
the
front
i
do
remember
what
degree
of
mud
we
had
attained
we
have
a
variety
of
adjectives
and
none
of
them
polite
to
describe
each
stage
the
worst
of
all
is
what
we
call
i
do
think
it
was
as
bad
as
that
but
it
was
bad
enough
everything
was
dim
and
clammy
and
spectral
at
the
hour
of
dawn
one
is
at
his
bravest
it
was
like
walking
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
only
things
that
were
thrown
at
you
travelled
faster
we
struck
a
sloppy
road
along
which
ghostly
figures
passed
with
ground
sheets
flung
across
their
head
and
shoulders
like
hooded
monks
at
a
point
where
scarlet
bundles
were
being
lifted
into
ambulances
we
branched
overland
here
and
there
from
all
directions
infantry
were
converging
picking
their
way
in
single
file
to
reduce
their
casualties
if
a
shell
burst
near
them
the
landscape
the
people
the
early
morning
everything
was
stealthy
and
walked
with
muted
steps
we
entered
a
trench
holes
were
scooped
out
in
the
side
of
it
just
large
enough
to
shelter
a
man
crouching
each
hole
contained
a
sleeping
soldier
who
looked
as
dead
as
the
occupant
of
a
catacomb
some
of
the
holes
had
been
blown
in
all
you
saw
of
the
late
occupant
was
a
protruding
arm
or
leg
at
best
there
was
a
horrid
similarity
between
the
dead
and
the
living
it
seemed
that
the
walls
of
the
trenches
had
been
built
out
of
corpses
for
one
recognised
the
uniforms
of
french
men
and
huns
they
built
out
of
them
though
whether
by
design
or
accident
it
was
impossible
to
tell
we
came
to
a
group
of
men
doing
some
repairing
that
part
of
the
trench
had
evidently
been
strafed
last
night
they
did
know
where
they
were
or
how
far
it
was
to
the
we
wandered
on
still
laying
in
our
wire
the
colonel
of
our
brigade
joined
us
and
we
waded
on
together
the
enemy
shelling
was
growing
more
intense
as
was
always
the
way
on
the
somme
when
we
were
bringing
out
our
wounded
a
good
many
of
our
trenches
were
directly
enfilade
shells
burst
just
behind
the
parapet
when
they
did
burst
on
it
it
was
at
about
this
point
in
my
that
i
received
a
blow
on
the
head
and
thanked
god
for
the
man
who
invented
the
steel
helmet
things
were
getting
distinctly
curious
we
had
passed
any
infantry
for
some
time
the
trenches
were
becoming
each
minute
more
shallow
and
neglected
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
furrow
which
was
packed
with
our
own
dead
they
had
been
there
for
some
time
and
were
partly
buried
they
were
sitting
up
or
lying
forward
in
every
attitude
of
agony
some
of
them
clasped
their
wounds
some
of
them
pointed
with
their
hands
their
faces
had
changed
to
every
colour
and
glared
at
us
like
swollen
bruises
their
helmets
were
off
with
a
pitiful
derisive
neatness
the
rain
had
parted
their
hair
we
had
to
crouch
low
because
the
trench
was
so
shallow
it
was
difficult
not
to
disturb
them
the
long
skirts
of
our
brushed
against
their
faces
all
of
a
sudden
we
halted
making
ourselves
as
small
as
could
be
in
the
rapidly
thinning
mist
ahead
of
us
men
were
moving
they
were
the
odd
thing
was
that
they
were
carrying
their
wounded
away
from
instead
of
towards
us
then
it
flashed
on
us
that
they
were
huns
we
had
wandered
into
no
man
land
almost
at
that
moment
we
must
have
been
spotted
for
shells
commenced
falling
at
the
end
of
the
trench
by
which
we
had
entered
spreading
out
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
we
commenced
to
crawl
towards
the
other
end
instantly
that
also
was
closed
to
us
and
a
curtain
of
shells
started
dropping
behind
us
we
were
trapped
with
perfect
coolness
a
coolness
which
whatever
i
looked
i
did
not
share
we
went
down
on
our
hands
and
knees
wriggling
our
way
through
the
corpses
and
in
the
direction
of
where
our
ought
to
be
after
what
seemed
an
age
we
got
back
later
we
registered
the
guns
and
one
of
our
officers
who
had
been
laying
in
wire
was
killed
in
the
process
his
death
like
everything
else
was
regarded
without
emotion
as
being
quite
ordinary
on
the
way
out
when
we
had
come
to
a
part
of
our
journey
where
the
tension
was
relaxed
and
we
could
be
less
cautious
i
saw
a
signalling
officer
lying
asleep
under
a
blackened
tree
i
called
my
attention
to
him
saying
look
at
that
silly
ass
sir
he
get
something
that
he
does
want
if
he
lies
there
much
my
major
turned
his
head
and
said
briefly
poor
chap
he
got
then
i
saw
that
his
had
burst
through
his
tunic
and
was
protruding
he
been
coming
out
walking
freely
and
feeling
that
the
danger
was
over
just
as
we
were
when
the
unlucky
shell
had
caught
him
his
name
must
have
been
written
on
it
our
men
say
when
that
happens
i
noticed
that
he
had
black
boots
since
then
nothing
would
persuade
me
to
wear
black
boots
in
the
trenches
this
first
experience
in
no
man
land
did
away
with
my
last
flabby
fear
that
if
i
was
afraid
i
would
show
it
one
is
often
afraid
any
soldier
who
asserts
the
contrary
may
not
be
a
liar
but
he
certainly
does
not
speak
the
truth
physical
fear
is
too
deeply
rooted
to
be
overcome
by
any
amount
of
training
it
remains
then
to
train
a
man
in
spiritual
pride
so
that
when
he
fears
nobody
knows
it
cowardice
is
contagious
it
has
been
said
that
no
battalion
is
braver
than
its
least
brave
member
military
courage
is
therefore
a
form
of
unselfishness
it
is
practised
that
it
may
save
weaker
lives
and
uphold
their
honour
the
worst
thing
you
can
say
of
a
man
at
the
front
is
he
does
play
the
that
does
of
necessity
mean
that
he
fails
to
do
his
duty
what
it
means
is
that
he
fails
to
do
a
little
bit
more
than
his
duty
when
a
man
plays
the
game
he
does
things
which
it
requires
a
braver
man
than
himself
to
accomplish
he
never
knows
when
he
done
he
acknowledges
no
limit
to
his
cheerfulness
and
strength
whatever
his
rank
he
holds
his
life
less
valuable
than
that
of
the
humblest
he
laughs
at
danger
not
because
he
does
not
dread
it
but
because
he
has
learnt
that
there
are
ailments
more
terrible
and
less
curable
than
death
the
men
in
the
ranks
taught
me
whatever
i
know
about
playing
the
game
i
learnt
from
their
example
in
acknowledging
this
i
own
up
to
the
new
equality
based
on
heroic
values
which
this
war
has
established
the
only
man
who
counts
out
there
is
the
man
who
is
sufficiently
to
show
courage
the
chaps
who
have
done
it
are
the
exceptions
at
the
start
of
the
war
there
were
a
good
many
persons
whom
we
were
apt
to
think
of
as
common
and
unclean
but
social
distinctions
are
a
in
the
trenches
we
have
seen
peter
vision
and
have
heard
the
voice
what
god
hath
cleansed
that
call
not
thou
until
i
became
a
part
of
the
war
i
was
a
doubter
of
nobility
in
others
and
a
sceptic
as
regards
myself
the
growth
of
my
personal
vision
was
complete
when
i
recognised
that
the
capacity
of
heroism
is
latent
in
everybody
and
only
awaits
the
bigness
of
the
opportunity
to
call
it
out
the
glory
of
the
trenches
we
were
too
proud
to
live
for
years
when
our
poor
death
could
dry
the
tears
of
little
children
yet
unborn
it
scarcely
mattered
that
at
morn
when
manhood
hope
was
at
its
height
we
stopped
a
bullet
in
it
did
not
trouble
us
to
lie
forgotten
the
forgetting
sky
so
long
sleep
was
our
only
cure
that
when
death
piped
of
rest
made
sure
we
cast
our
fleshly
crutches
down
laughing
like
boys
in
hamelin
town
and
this
we
did
while
loving
life
yet
loving
more
than
home
or
wife
the
kindness
of
a
world
set
free
for
countless
children
yet
to
be
iii
god
as
we
see
him
for
some
time
before
i
was
wounded
we
had
been
in
very
hot
places
we
could
scarcely
expect
them
to
be
otherwise
for
we
had
put
on
show
after
show
a
show
in
our
language
i
should
explain
has
nothing
in
common
with
a
theatrical
performance
though
it
does
not
lack
drama
we
make
the
term
apply
to
any
method
of
irritating
the
hun
from
a
to
a
big
offensive
the
hun
was
decidedly
annoyed
he
had
very
good
reason
we
were
occupying
the
which
he
had
spent
two
years
in
building
with
french
civilian
labour
his
threats
had
failed
he
had
offered
us
the
and
his
peace
terms
had
been
rejected
with
a
peal
of
guns
all
along
the
western
front
he
had
shown
his
disapproval
of
us
by
paying
particular
attention
to
our
batteries
as
a
consequence
our
were
all
used
up
having
gone
out
with
the
gentlemen
on
stretchers
who
were
contemplating
a
vacation
in
blighty
we
could
get
enough
to
them
there
was
a
hitch
somewhere
the
demand
for
exceeded
the
supply
so
i
got
on
my
horse
one
sunday
and
with
my
groom
accompanying
me
rode
into
the
to
see
if
i
could
pick
some
up
at
various
field
dressing
stations
and
collecting
points
in
the
course
of
my
wanderings
i
came
to
a
cathedral
city
it
was
a
city
which
was
and
still
is
beautiful
despite
the
constant
bombardments
the
huns
had
just
finished
hurling
a
few
more
tons
of
explosives
into
it
as
i
and
my
groom
entered
the
streets
were
deserted
it
might
have
been
a
city
of
the
dead
there
was
no
sound
except
the
ringing
iron
of
our
horses
shoes
on
the
cobble
pavement
here
and
there
we
came
to
what
looked
like
a
barricade
which
barred
our
progress
actually
it
was
the
walls
and
rubbish
of
buildings
which
had
collapsed
from
cellars
now
and
then
faces
of
women
children
and
ancient
men
peered
out
they
were
sharp
and
pointed
like
rats
one
imagination
went
back
five
hundred
years
everything
seemed
mediaeval
and
brutal
this
might
have
been
limoges
after
the
black
prince
had
finished
massacring
its
citizens
or
it
might
have
been
paris
when
the
wolves
came
down
and
françois
villon
tried
to
find
a
lodging
for
the
night
i
turned
up
through
narrow
alleys
where
grass
was
growing
and
found
myself
almost
by
accident
in
a
garden
it
was
a
green
and
spacious
garden
with
walls
about
it
and
flowers
which
scattered
themselves
broadcast
in
neglected
riot
we
dismounted
and
tied
our
horses
wandering
along
its
paths
we
came
across
little
statues
fountains
and
then
without
any
hindrance
found
ourselves
in
the
nave
of
a
fine
cathedral
which
was
roofed
only
by
the
sky
two
years
of
the
huns
had
made
it
as
much
a
ruin
as
tintern
abbey
here
too
the
flowers
had
intruded
they
grew
between
graves
in
the
pavement
and
scrambled
up
the
walls
wherever
they
could
find
a
foothold
at
the
far
end
of
this
stretch
of
destruction
stood
the
high
altar
totally
untouched
by
the
hurricane
of
the
saints
were
perched
in
their
niches
composed
and
stately
the
christ
looked
down
from
his
cross
as
he
had
done
for
centuries
sweeping
the
length
of
splendid
architecture
with
sad
eyes
it
seemed
a
miracle
that
the
altar
had
been
spared
when
everything
else
had
fallen
a
reason
is
given
for
its
escape
every
sabbath
since
the
start
of
the
war
no
matter
how
severe
the
bombardment
service
has
been
held
there
the
women
children
and
ancient
men
have
crept
out
from
their
cellars
and
gathered
about
the
priest
the
lamp
has
been
lit
the
host
uplifted
the
hun
is
aware
of
this
with
malice
aforethought
he
lands
shells
into
the
cathedral
every
sunday
in
an
effort
to
smash
the
altar
so
far
he
has
failed
one
finds
in
this
a
symbol
that
in
the
heart
of
the
maelstrom
of
horror
which
this
war
has
created
there
is
a
quiet
place
where
the
lamp
of
gentleness
and
honour
is
kept
burning
the
hun
will
have
to
do
a
lot
more
shelling
before
he
puts
the
lamp
of
kindness
out
from
the
polluted
trenches
of
vimy
the
poppies
spring
up
blazoning
abroad
in
vivid
scarlet
the
heroism
of
our
lads
willing
sacrifice
all
this
april
high
above
the
shouting
of
our
guns
the
larks
sang
joyously
the
scarlet
of
the
poppies
the
song
of
the
larks
the
lamp
shining
on
the
altar
are
only
external
signs
of
the
unconquerable
happy
religion
which
lies
hidden
in
the
hearts
of
our
men
their
religion
is
the
religion
of
heroism
which
they
have
learnt
in
the
glory
of
the
trenches
there
was
a
line
from
william
morris
which
used
to
haunt
me
especially
in
the
early
days
when
i
was
first
experiencing
what
war
really
meant
since
returning
for
a
brief
space
to
where
books
are
accessible
i
have
looked
up
the
quotation
it
reads
as
follows
of
heaven
or
hell
i
have
no
power
to
sing
i
can
not
ease
the
burden
of
your
fears
or
make
death
a
little
it
is
the
last
line
that
makes
me
smile
rather
quietly
or
make
death
a
little
i
smile
because
the
souls
who
wear
khaki
have
learnt
to
do
just
that
morris
goes
on
to
say
that
all
he
can
do
to
make
people
happy
is
to
tell
them
deathless
stories
about
heroes
who
have
passed
into
the
world
of
the
imagination
and
because
of
that
are
immune
from
death
he
calls
himself
the
idle
singer
of
an
empty
how
typical
he
is
of
the
days
before
the
war
when
people
had
only
to
endure
and
consequently
did
exert
themselves
to
be
brave
a
big
sacrifice
which
bankrupts
one
life
is
always
more
bearable
than
the
little
inevitable
annoyances
of
sickness
disappointment
and
dying
in
a
bed
it
easier
for
christ
to
go
to
calvary
than
for
an
to
lose
a
night
sleep
in
the
garden
when
the
world
went
well
with
us
before
the
war
we
were
doubters
nearly
all
the
fiction
of
the
past
fifteen
years
is
a
proof
of
that
it
records
our
fear
of
failure
sex
old
age
and
particularly
of
a
god
who
refuses
to
explain
himself
now
when
we
have
thrust
the
world
affections
life
itself
behind
us
and
gaze
hourly
into
the
eyes
of
death
belief
comes
as
simply
and
clearly
as
it
did
when
we
were
children
curious
and
extraordinary
the
burden
of
our
fears
has
slipped
from
our
shoulders
in
our
attempt
to
do
something
for
others
the
unbelievable
and
long
coveted
miracle
has
happened
at
last
to
every
soul
who
has
grasped
his
chance
of
heroism
death
has
become
a
calamity
in
saying
this
i
do
not
mean
to
glorify
war
war
can
never
be
anything
but
beastly
and
damnable
it
dates
back
to
the
jungle
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
war
there
the
kind
that
a
highwayman
wages
when
he
pounces
from
the
bushes
and
assaults
a
defenceless
woman
there
the
kind
you
wage
when
you
go
to
her
rescue
the
highwayman
ca
expect
to
come
out
of
the
fight
with
a
loftier
morality
you
can
our
chaps
never
wanted
to
fight
they
hate
fighting
it
that
hatred
of
the
thing
they
are
compelled
to
do
that
makes
them
so
terrible
the
last
thought
to
enter
their
heads
four
years
ago
was
that
they
would
be
in
khaki
they
had
never
been
trained
to
the
use
of
arms
a
good
many
of
them
conceived
of
themselves
as
cowards
they
entered
the
war
to
defend
rather
than
to
destroy
they
literally
put
behind
them
houses
brethren
sisters
father
mother
wife
children
lands
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
sake
though
they
would
be
the
last
to
express
themselves
in
that
fashion
at
a
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
on
the
way
to
a
we
once
had
stood
a
calvary
one
of
those
wayside
altars
so
frequently
met
in
france
with
pollarded
trees
surrounding
it
and
an
image
of
christ
in
his
agony
pious
peasants
on
their
journey
to
market
or
as
they
worked
in
the
fields
had
been
accustomed
to
raise
their
eyes
to
it
and
cross
themselves
it
had
comforted
them
with
the
knowledge
of
protection
the
road
leading
back
from
it
and
up
the
hill
was
gleaming
white
a
direct
enfilade
for
the
hun
and
always
under
observation
he
kept
guns
trained
on
it
at
odd
intervals
any
hour
during
the
day
or
night
he
would
sweep
it
with
the
woods
in
the
vicinity
were
blasted
and
blackened
it
was
the
season
for
leaves
and
flowers
but
there
was
no
greenness
whatever
of
vegetation
had
not
been
uprooted
and
buried
had
been
poisoned
by
gas
the
atmosphere
was
vile
with
the
odour
of
decaying
flesh
in
the
early
morning
if
you
passed
by
the
calvary
there
was
always
some
fresh
tragedy
the
newly
dead
lay
sprawled
out
against
its
steps
as
though
they
had
dragged
themselves
there
in
their
last
moments
if
you
looked
along
the
road
all
the
glazed
eyes
seemed
to
stare
towards
it
lord
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom
they
seemed
to
say
the
wooden
christ
gazed
down
on
them
from
his
cross
with
a
suffering
which
two
thousand
years
ago
he
had
shared
the
terrible
pity
of
his
silence
seemed
to
be
telling
them
that
they
had
become
one
with
him
in
their
final
sacrifice
they
had
lived
his
life
far
from
it
unknowingly
they
had
died
his
death
that
a
part
of
the
glory
of
the
trenches
that
a
man
who
has
not
been
good
can
crucify
himself
and
hang
beside
christ
in
the
end
one
wonders
in
what
pleasant
places
those
weary
souls
find
rest
there
was
a
second
calvary
a
heap
of
ruins
nothing
of
the
altar
or
trees
by
which
it
had
been
surrounded
was
left
the
first
time
i
passed
it
i
saw
a
foot
protruding
the
man
might
be
wounded
i
climbed
up
to
examine
and
pulled
aside
the
debris
beneath
it
i
found
like
that
of
one
three
weeks
dead
the
naked
body
of
the
christ
the
exploding
shell
had
wrenched
it
from
its
cross
aslant
the
face
with
gratuitous
blasphemy
the
crown
of
thorns
was
tilted
these
two
calvaries
picture
for
me
the
part
that
christ
is
playing
in
the
present
war
he
survives
in
the
noble
of
the
men
he
is
in
the
defilements
that
are
wrought
upon
their
bodies
god
as
we
see
him
and
do
we
see
him
i
think
so
but
not
always
consciously
he
moves
among
us
in
the
forms
of
our
brother
men
we
see
him
most
evidently
when
danger
is
most
threatening
and
courage
is
at
its
highest
we
do
often
recognise
him
out
loud
our
chaps
assert
that
they
his
they
too
and
inarticulate
for
that
they
where
they
are
because
they
want
to
do
their
bit
their
duty
a
carefully
disguised
instinct
of
honour
brought
them
there
doing
their
bit
in
bible
language
means
laying
down
their
lives
for
their
friends
after
all
they
not
so
far
from
nazareth
their
that
covers
everything
here
an
example
of
how
god
walks
among
us
in
one
of
our
attacks
on
the
somme
all
the
observers
up
forward
were
uncertain
as
to
what
had
happened
we
know
whether
our
infantry
had
captured
their
objective
failed
or
gone
beyond
it
the
battlefield
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
was
a
bath
of
mud
it
is
extremely
easy
in
the
excitement
of
an
offensive
when
all
landmarks
are
blotted
out
for
our
storming
parties
to
lose
their
direction
if
this
happens
a
number
of
dangers
may
result
a
battalion
may
find
itself
up
in
the
air
which
means
that
it
has
failed
to
connect
with
the
battalions
on
its
right
and
left
its
flanks
are
then
exposed
to
the
enemy
it
may
advance
too
far
and
start
digging
itself
in
at
a
point
where
it
was
previously
arranged
that
our
artillery
should
place
their
protective
wall
of
fire
we
being
up
forward
as
artillery
observers
are
the
eyes
of
the
army
it
is
our
business
to
watch
for
such
contingencies
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
situation
as
it
progresses
and
to
send
our
information
back
as
quickly
as
possible
we
were
peering
through
our
glasses
from
our
point
of
vantage
when
far
away
in
the
thickest
of
the
we
saw
a
white
flag
wagging
sending
back
messages
the
was
repeated
desperately
it
was
evident
that
no
one
had
replied
and
probable
that
no
one
had
picked
up
the
messages
a
signaller
who
was
with
us
read
the
language
for
us
a
company
of
infantry
had
advanced
too
far
they
were
most
of
them
wounded
very
many
of
them
dead
and
they
were
in
danger
of
being
surrounded
they
asked
for
our
artillery
to
place
a
curtain
of
fire
in
front
of
them
and
for
reinforcements
to
be
sent
up
we
at
once
the
orders
through
to
our
artillery
and
notified
the
infantry
headquarters
of
the
division
that
was
holding
that
front
but
it
was
necessary
to
let
those
chaps
know
that
we
were
aware
of
their
predicament
they
hang
on
if
they
knew
that
otherwise
without
orders
our
signaller
was
getting
his
flags
ready
if
he
hopped
out
of
the
trench
onto
the
parapet
he
did
stand
a
chance
the
hun
was
familiar
with
our
observation
station
and
strafed
it
with
persistent
regularity
the
signaller
turned
to
the
senior
officer
present
what
will
i
send
them
sir
tell
them
their
messages
have
been
received
and
that
help
is
out
the
chap
scrambled
a
flag
in
either
hand
he
was
nothing
but
a
boy
he
ran
crouching
like
a
rabbit
to
a
hump
of
mud
where
his
figure
would
show
up
against
the
sky
his
flags
commenced
wagging
messages
received
help
they
did
see
him
at
first
he
had
to
repeat
the
words
we
watched
him
breathlessly
we
knew
what
would
happen
at
last
it
happened
a
hun
observer
had
spotted
him
and
flashed
the
target
back
to
his
guns
all
about
him
the
mud
commenced
to
leap
and
bubble
he
went
on
signalling
the
good
word
to
those
stranded
men
up
front
messages
received
help
at
last
they
seen
him
they
were
signaling
o
it
was
at
that
moment
that
a
lifted
him
off
his
feet
and
landed
him
all
of
a
huddle
bit
it
was
what
he
volunteered
to
do
when
he
came
from
canada
the
signalled
o
in
the
battlesmoke
was
like
a
testimony
to
his
character
that
the
kind
of
peep
at
god
we
get
on
the
western
front
it
is
a
sad
peep
either
when
men
die
for
something
worth
while
death
loses
all
its
terror
it
petering
out
in
bed
from
sickness
or
old
age
that
so
horrifying
many
a
man
whose
cowardice
is
at
loggerheads
with
his
sense
of
duty
comes
to
the
front
as
a
he
compromises
with
his
conscience
and
takes
a
job
in
some
service
whose
place
is
well
behind
the
lines
he
does
stop
there
long
if
he
a
decent
sort
having
learnt
more
than
ever
he
guessed
before
about
the
brutal
things
that
can
do
to
you
he
transfers
into
a
fighting
unit
why
because
danger
does
appal
it
allures
it
holds
a
challenge
it
stings
one
pride
it
urges
one
to
seek
out
ascending
scales
of
risk
just
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
is
flabby
the
safe
job
is
the
only
job
for
which
there
no
competition
in
fighting
units
you
have
to
persuade
men
to
be
grooms
or
cooks
or
batmen
if
you
seeking
volunteers
for
a
chance
at
annihilation
you
have
to
cast
lots
to
avoid
the
offence
of
rejecting
all
of
this
is
inexplicable
to
civilians
i
heard
them
call
the
men
at
the
front
spiritual
geniuses
which
sounds
splendid
but
means
nothing
if
civilian
philosophers
fail
to
explain
us
we
can
explain
them
in
their
world
they
are
the
centre
of
their
universe
they
look
inward
instead
of
outward
the
sun
rises
and
sets
to
minister
to
their
particular
happiness
if
they
should
die
the
stars
would
vanish
we
understand
a
few
months
ago
we
too
were
like
that
what
makes
us
reckless
of
death
is
our
intense
gratitude
that
we
have
altered
we
want
to
prove
to
ourselves
in
excess
how
utterly
we
are
changed
from
what
we
were
in
his
secret
heart
the
egotist
is
a
can
you
imagine
what
a
difference
it
works
in
a
man
after
years
of
at
least
for
one
brief
moment
to
approve
of
himself
ever
since
we
can
remember
we
were
chained
to
the
of
our
bodies
we
lived
to
feed
our
bodies
to
clothe
our
bodies
to
preserve
our
bodies
to
minister
to
their
passions
now
we
know
that
our
bodies
are
mere
flimsy
shells
in
which
our
souls
are
paramount
we
can
fling
them
aside
any
minute
they
become
ignoble
the
moment
the
soul
has
departed
we
have
proof
often
at
zero
hour
we
have
seen
whole
populations
of
cities
go
over
the
top
and
vanish
leaving
behind
them
their
bloody
rags
we
should
go
mad
if
we
did
not
believe
in
immortality
we
know
that
the
physical
is
not
the
essential
part
how
better
can
a
man
shake
off
his
flesh
than
at
the
hour
when
his
spirit
is
most
shining
the
exact
day
when
he
dies
does
not
matter
or
fifty
years
hence
the
vital
concern
is
not
but
the
civilian
philosopher
considers
what
we
lost
he
forgets
that
it
could
never
have
been
ours
for
long
in
many
cases
it
was
misused
and
scarcely
worth
having
while
it
lasted
some
of
us
were
too
weak
to
use
it
well
we
might
use
it
better
now
we
turn
from
such
thoughts
and
reckon
up
our
gains
on
the
debit
side
we
place
ourselves
as
we
were
we
probably
caught
a
train
every
morning
the
same
train
we
went
to
a
business
where
we
sat
at
a
desk
neither
the
business
nor
the
desk
ever
altered
we
received
the
same
strafing
from
the
same
employer
or
if
we
were
the
employer
we
administered
the
same
strafing
we
only
did
these
things
that
we
might
eat
bread
our
dreams
were
all
selfish
of
more
clothes
more
respect
more
food
bigger
houses
the
least
part
of
the
day
we
devoted
to
the
people
and
the
things
we
really
cared
for
and
the
people
we
loved
we
were
always
nice
to
them
on
the
credit
side
we
place
ourselves
as
we
are
doing
a
job
doing
it
for
some
one
else
and
unafraid
to
meet
god
before
the
war
the
word
ideals
had
grown
and
priggish
we
had
substituted
for
it
the
more
robust
word
today
ideals
have
come
back
to
their
place
in
our
vocabulary
we
have
forgotten
that
we
ever
had
ambitions
but
at
this
moment
men
are
drowning
for
ideals
in
the
mud
of
flanders
nevertheless
it
is
true
it
is
natural
to
be
brave
how
then
have
multitudes
of
men
acquired
this
sudden
knack
of
courage
they
have
been
educated
by
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
when
big
sacrifices
have
been
demanded
men
have
never
been
found
lacking
and
they
have
acquired
it
through
discipline
and
training
when
you
have
subjected
yourself
to
discipline
you
cease
to
think
of
yourself
are
not
but
a
part
of
a
company
of
men
if
you
do
do
your
duty
you
throw
the
whole
machine
out
you
soon
learn
the
hard
lesson
that
every
man
life
and
every
man
service
belong
to
other
people
of
this
the
organisation
of
an
army
is
a
vivid
illustration
take
the
infantry
for
instance
they
ca
fight
by
themselves
they
dependent
on
the
support
of
the
artillery
the
artillery
in
their
turn
would
be
terribly
crippled
were
it
not
for
the
gallantry
of
the
air
service
if
the
infantry
collapse
the
guns
have
to
go
back
if
the
infantry
advance
the
guns
have
to
be
pulled
forward
this
close
interdependence
of
service
on
service
division
on
division
battalion
on
battery
follows
right
down
through
the
army
till
it
reaches
the
individual
so
that
each
man
feels
that
the
day
will
be
lost
if
he
fails
his
imagination
becomes
intrigued
by
the
immensity
of
the
stakes
for
which
he
plays
any
physical
calamity
which
may
happen
to
himself
becomes
trifling
when
compared
with
the
disgrace
he
would
bring
upon
his
regiment
if
he
were
not
courageous
a
few
months
ago
i
was
handing
over
a
in
a
fairly
warm
place
the
major
who
came
up
to
take
over
from
me
brought
with
him
a
subaltern
and
just
enough
men
to
run
the
guns
within
of
their
arrival
a
stray
shell
came
over
and
caught
the
subaltern
and
five
of
the
it
was
plain
at
once
that
the
subaltern
was
dying
his
name
must
have
been
written
on
the
shell
as
we
say
in
france
we
got
a
stretcher
and
made
all
haste
to
rush
him
out
to
a
just
as
he
was
leaving
he
asked
to
speak
with
his
major
i
so
sorry
sir
i
did
mean
to
get
wounded
he
whispered
the
last
word
he
sent
back
from
the
where
he
died
was
tell
the
major
i
did
mean
to
do
discipline
he
did
think
of
himself
all
he
thought
of
was
that
his
major
would
be
left
here
another
story
illustrating
how
mercilessly
discipline
can
restore
a
man
to
his
higher
self
last
spring
the
night
before
an
attack
a
man
was
brought
into
a
battalion
headquarters
under
arrest
the
adjutant
and
colonel
were
busy
attending
to
the
last
details
of
their
preparations
the
adjutant
looked
up
irritably
what
is
it
the
of
the
guard
answered
we
found
this
man
sir
in
a
communication
trench
his
company
has
been
in
the
two
hours
he
was
sitting
down
with
his
equipment
thrown
away
and
evidently
had
no
intention
of
going
the
adjutant
glanced
coldly
at
the
prisoner
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
the
man
was
ghastly
white
and
shaking
like
an
aspen
sir
i
not
the
man
i
was
since
i
saw
my
best
friend
jimmie
with
his
head
blown
off
and
lying
in
his
hands
it
kind
of
got
me
i
ca
face
up
to
the
adjutant
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
said
you
know
you
have
a
double
choice
you
can
either
be
shot
up
there
doing
your
duty
or
behind
the
lines
as
a
coward
it
for
you
to
choose
i
the
interview
was
ended
he
turned
again
to
the
colonel
the
man
slowly
straightened
himself
saluted
like
a
soldier
and
marched
out
alone
to
the
front
that
what
discipline
does
for
a
man
who
going
back
on
himself
one
of
the
big
influences
that
helps
to
keep
a
soldier
soul
sanitary
is
what
is
known
in
the
british
army
as
spit
and
directly
we
pull
out
for
a
rest
we
start
to
work
burnishing
and
washing
the
chaps
may
have
shown
the
most
brilliant
courage
and
endurance
it
counts
for
nothing
if
they
untidy
the
first
morning
no
matter
what
are
the
weather
conditions
we
hold
an
inspection
every
man
has
to
show
up
with
his
chin
shaved
hair
cut
leather
polished
and
buttons
shining
if
he
does
he
gets
hell
there
a
lot
in
it
you
bring
a
man
out
from
a
tight
corner
where
he
been
in
hourly
contact
with
death
he
apt
to
think
what
the
use
of
taking
pride
in
myself
i
likely
to
be
in
any
day
it
be
all
the
same
when
i
but
if
he
does
keep
clean
in
his
body
he
wo
keep
clean
in
his
mind
the
man
who
has
his
buttons
shining
brightly
and
his
leather
polished
is
usually
the
man
who
is
brightly
polished
inside
spit
and
polish
teaches
a
man
to
come
out
of
the
trenches
from
seeing
his
pals
killed
and
to
carry
on
as
though
nothing
abnormal
had
happened
it
educates
him
in
an
impersonal
attitude
towards
calamity
which
makes
it
bearable
it
forces
him
not
to
regard
anything
too
tragically
if
you
can
stand
aside
from
yourself
and
poke
fun
at
your
own
tragedy
and
tragedy
always
has
its
humorous
aspect
that
helps
the
songs
which
have
been
inspired
by
the
trenches
are
examples
of
this
tendency
the
last
thing
you
find
anybody
singing
out
there
is
something
patriotic
the
last
thing
you
find
anybody
reading
is
rupert
poems
when
men
sing
among
the
they
prefer
a
song
which
belittles
their
own
heroism
please
picture
to
yourself
a
company
of
scarecrows
in
plodding
their
way
under
intermittent
shelling
through
a
battered
trench
whistling
and
humming
the
following
splendid
sentiments
from
plea
of
the
conscientious
send
us
the
army
and
the
navy
send
us
the
rank
and
file
send
us
the
grand
old
territorials
they
face
the
danger
with
a
smile
where
are
the
boys
of
the
old
brigade
who
made
old
england
free
you
may
send
my
mother
my
sister
or
my
brother
but
for
gawd
sake
do
send
they
leave
off
whistling
and
humming
to
shout
the
last
line
a
shell
falls
near
them
then
another
then
another
they
crouch
for
a
minute
against
the
sticky
walls
to
escape
the
flying
spray
of
death
then
they
plod
onward
again
through
the
mud
whistling
and
humming
but
for
gawd
sake
do
send
they
probably
a
carrying
party
taking
up
the
rations
to
their
pals
it
quite
likely
they
have
a
bad
time
there
the
smell
of
gas
in
the
air
good
luck
to
them
they
disappear
round
the
next
traverse
our
men
sing
many
mad
burlesques
on
their
own
splendour
parodies
on
their
daily
fineness
here
a
last
example
a
on
a
little
bit
of
oh
a
little
bit
of
shrapnel
fell
from
out
the
sky
one
day
and
it
landed
on
a
soldier
in
a
field
not
far
away
but
when
they
went
to
find
him
he
was
bust
beyond
repair
so
they
pulled
his
legs
and
arms
off
and
they
left
him
lying
there
then
they
buried
him
in
flanders
just
to
make
the
new
crops
grow
he
make
the
best
manure
they
say
and
sure
they
ought
to
know
and
they
put
a
little
cross
up
which
bore
his
name
so
grand
on
the
day
he
took
his
farewell
for
a
better
promised
one
learns
to
laugh
one
has
to
just
as
he
has
to
learn
to
believe
in
immortality
the
front
affords
plenty
of
occasions
for
humour
if
a
man
has
only
learnt
to
laugh
at
himself
i
had
been
sent
forward
to
report
at
a
battalion
headquarters
as
liaison
officer
for
an
attack
the
headquarters
were
in
a
captured
somewhere
under
a
ruined
house
just
as
i
got
there
and
was
searching
among
the
fallen
walls
for
an
entrance
the
hun
barrage
came
down
it
was
like
the
yellowstone
park
when
all
the
geysers
are
angry
at
the
same
time
roofs
beams
chips
of
stone
commenced
to
fly
in
every
direction
in
the
middle
of
the
hubbub
a
small
dump
of
bombs
was
struck
by
a
shell
and
started
to
explode
behind
me
the
blast
of
the
explosion
caught
me
up
and
hurled
me
down
fifteen
stairs
of
the
i
had
been
trying
to
discover
i
landed
on
all
fours
in
a
place
full
of
darkness
a
door
banged
behind
me
i
do
know
how
long
i
lay
there
something
was
squirming
under
me
a
voice
said
plaintively
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
wish
you
get
off
the
it
a
queer
country
that
place
we
call
out
you
approach
our
as
it
is
across
anywhere
from
five
to
twenty
miles
of
battlefields
nothing
in
the
way
of
habitation
is
left
everything
has
been
beaten
into
pulp
by
hurricanes
of
first
you
come
to
a
metropolis
of
which
makes
you
think
that
a
mammoth
circus
has
arrived
then
you
come
to
plank
roads
and
little
light
railways
running
out
like
veins
across
the
mud
far
away
there
a
ridge
and
a
row
of
charred
trees
which
stand
out
gloomily
etched
against
the
sky
the
sky
is
grey
and
damp
and
sickly
fleecy
balls
of
smoke
burst
against
it
shrapnel
you
wonder
whether
they
caught
anybody
overhead
you
hear
the
purr
of
engines
a
flight
of
aeroplanes
breasting
the
clouds
behind
you
observation
balloons
hang
stationary
like
gigantic
tethered
sausages
if
you
riding
you
dismount
before
you
reach
the
ridge
and
send
your
horse
back
the
hun
country
is
in
sight
on
the
other
side
you
creep
up
cautiously
taking
careful
note
of
where
the
shells
are
falling
there
nothing
to
be
gained
by
walking
into
a
barrage
you
make
up
your
mind
to
wait
the
rate
of
fire
has
slackened
you
make
a
dash
for
it
from
the
ridge
there
a
pathway
which
runs
down
through
the
blackened
wood
two
men
going
alone
are
not
likely
to
be
spotted
not
likely
but
there
an
old
cement
hun
to
the
right
you
take
cover
in
it
pretty
wide
awake
you
say
to
your
companion
to
have
picked
us
out
as
quickly
as
from
this
sheltered
hiding
you
have
time
to
gaze
about
you
the
roof
of
the
is
smashed
in
at
one
corner
our
heavies
did
that
when
the
hun
held
the
ridge
it
was
good
shooting
a
perfect
warren
of
tunnels
and
leads
off
in
every
direction
they
were
built
by
the
forced
labour
of
captive
french
civilians
we
have
found
requests
from
them
scrawled
in
pencil
on
the
boards
i
jean
ribeau
was
alive
and
well
on
may
if
this
meets
the
eye
of
a
friend
i
beg
that
he
will
inform
my
wife
etc
after
which
follows
the
address
these
underground
fortifications
proved
as
much
a
snare
as
a
protection
to
our
enemies
i
smile
to
remember
how
after
our
infantry
had
advanced
three
miles
they
captured
a
hun
major
busily
shaving
himself
in
his
quite
unaware
that
anything
unusual
was
happening
he
was
very
angry
because
he
had
been
calling
in
vain
for
his
man
to
bring
his
hot
water
when
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
our
infantry
on
the
stairs
he
thought
it
was
his
servant
and
started
strafing
he
got
the
surprise
of
his
venerable
life
when
he
saw
the
khaki
from
the
the
hill
slants
steeply
to
the
plain
it
was
once
finely
wooded
now
the
trees
lie
thick
as
corpses
where
an
attack
has
failed
scythed
down
by
bursting
shells
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
plain
spreads
out
a
sea
of
furrowed
slime
and
craters
it
difficult
to
pick
out
trenches
nothing
is
moving
it
hard
to
believe
that
anything
can
live
down
there
suddenly
as
though
a
gigantic
were
at
work
the
mud
is
thrashed
and
tormented
smoke
drifts
across
the
area
that
is
being
strafed
through
the
smoke
the
stakes
and
wire
hurtle
if
you
had
been
in
flurries
of
that
sort
yourself
you
think
that
no
one
could
exist
through
it
it
ended
now
once
again
the
country
lies
dead
and
breathless
in
a
kind
of
horrible
suspense
suspense
yes
that
the
word
beyond
the
mud
in
the
far
cool
distance
is
a
green
untroubled
country
the
huns
live
there
that
the
worst
of
doing
all
the
attacking
we
live
on
the
recent
battlefields
we
have
won
whereas
the
enemy
retreats
into
untouched
cleanness
one
can
see
church
steeples
peeping
above
woods
chateaus
gleaming
and
stretches
of
shining
river
it
looks
innocent
and
kindly
but
from
the
depth
of
its
greenness
invisible
eyes
peer
out
do
you
make
one
unwary
movement
and
over
comes
a
flock
of
shells
at
night
from
out
this
swamp
of
vileness
a
phantom
city
floats
up
it
is
composed
of
the
white
very
lights
and
flares
which
the
hun
employs
to
protect
his
from
our
patrols
for
brief
spells
no
man
land
becomes
brilliant
as
day
many
of
his
flares
are
prearranged
signals
meaning
that
his
artillery
is
shooting
short
or
calling
for
an
the
combination
of
lights
which
mean
these
things
are
changed
with
great
frequency
lest
we
should
guess
the
with
a
long
night
of
observing
before
him
becomes
imaginative
and
weaves
out
for
the
dancing
lights
a
kind
of
nights
entertainment
the
phantom
city
over
there
is
london
new
york
paris
according
to
his
fancy
he
going
out
to
dinner
with
his
girl
all
those
flares
are
along
boulevards
that
last
white
rocket
that
went
flaming
across
the
sky
was
the
faery
taxi
which
is
to
speed
him
on
his
happy
errand
it
is
so
one
has
only
to
remember
we
were
in
the
somme
for
several
months
the
mud
was
up
to
our
knees
almost
all
the
time
we
were
perishingly
cold
and
very
rarely
dry
there
was
no
natural
cover
when
we
went
up
forward
to
observe
we
would
stand
in
water
to
our
knees
for
hours
rather
than
go
into
the
they
were
so
full
of
vermin
and
battened
flies
wounded
and
strayed
men
often
drowned
on
their
journey
back
from
the
many
of
the
dead
never
got
buried
lives
be
risked
in
carrying
them
out
we
were
so
weary
that
the
sight
of
those
who
rested
for
ever
only
stirred
in
us
a
quiet
envy
our
emotions
were
too
exhausted
for
hatred
they
usually
are
unless
some
new
hunnishness
has
roused
them
when
we
having
a
bad
time
we
glance
across
no
man
land
and
say
poor
old
fritzie
he
getting
the
worst
of
that
thought
helps
an
attack
is
a
relaxation
from
the
interminable
monotony
it
means
that
we
shall
exchange
the
old
mud
in
which
we
have
been
living
for
new
mud
which
may
be
better
months
of
work
and
preparation
have
led
up
to
it
then
one
morning
at
dawn
in
an
intense
silence
we
wait
with
our
eyes
glued
on
our
watches
for
the
exact
second
which
is
zero
hour
all
of
a
sudden
our
guns
open
up
joyously
as
a
peal
of
bells
it
like
judgment
day
a
wild
excitement
quickens
the
heart
every
privation
was
worth
this
moment
you
wonder
where
be
by
over
there
in
the
hun
support
trenches
or
in
a
green
world
which
you
used
to
sing
about
on
sundays
you
do
much
care
so
long
as
you
completed
your
job
we
well
away
you
laugh
to
the
chap
next
you
the
show
has
commenced
when
you
have
given
people
every
reason
you
can
think
of
which
explains
the
spirit
of
our
men
they
still
shake
their
heads
in
a
bewildered
manner
murmuring
i
do
know
how
you
stand
going
to
make
one
last
attempt
at
explanation
we
stick
it
out
by
believing
that
we
in
the
right
to
believe
you
in
the
right
makes
a
lot
of
difference
you
glance
across
no
man
land
and
say
those
blighters
are
wrong
i
if
you
believe
that
with
all
the
strength
of
your
soul
and
mind
you
can
stand
anything
to
allow
yourself
to
be
beaten
would
be
to
own
that
you
were
to
still
hold
that
you
right
in
the
face
of
armed
assertions
from
the
hun
that
you
wrong
requires
pride
in
your
regiment
your
division
your
corps
and
most
of
all
in
your
own
integrity
no
one
who
has
not
worn
a
uniform
can
understand
what
pride
in
a
regiment
can
do
for
a
man
for
instance
in
france
every
man
wears
his
divisional
patch
which
marks
him
he
jolly
proud
of
his
division
and
consciously
do
anything
to
let
it
down
if
he
hears
anything
said
to
its
credit
he
treasures
the
saying
up
it
as
if
he
himself
had
been
mentioned
in
despatches
it
was
rumoured
this
year
that
the
night
before
an
attack
a
certain
imperial
general
called
his
battalion
commanders
together
when
they
were
assembled
he
said
gentlemen
i
have
called
you
together
to
tell
you
that
tomorrow
morning
you
will
be
confronted
by
one
of
the
most
difficult
tasks
that
has
ever
been
allotted
to
you
you
will
have
to
measure
up
to
the
traditions
of
the
division
on
our
left
the
first
canadian
division
which
is
in
my
opinion
the
finest
fighting
division
in
i
do
know
whether
the
story
is
true
or
not
if
the
imperial
general
did
say
it
he
ought
to
have
but
because
i
belong
to
the
first
canadian
division
i
believe
the
report
true
and
set
store
by
it
every
new
man
who
joins
our
division
hears
that
story
he
feels
that
he
too
has
got
to
be
worthy
of
it
when
he
tempted
to
get
the
he
glances
down
at
the
patch
on
his
arm
it
means
as
much
to
him
as
a
so
he
steadies
his
nerves
squares
his
jaws
and
plays
the
man
there
believing
you
right
there
your
sense
of
pride
and
then
there
something
else
without
which
neither
of
the
other
two
would
help
you
it
seems
a
mad
thing
to
say
with
reference
to
fighting
men
but
that
other
thing
which
enables
you
to
meet
sacrifice
gladly
is
love
there
a
song
we
sing
in
england
a
great
favourite
which
when
it
has
recounted
all
the
things
we
need
to
make
us
good
and
happy
tops
the
list
with
these
final
requisites
a
little
patience
and
a
lot
of
we
need
the
patience
that
goes
without
saying
but
it
the
love
that
helps
us
to
die
gladly
love
for
our
cause
our
pals
our
family
our
country
under
the
disguise
of
duty
one
has
to
do
an
awful
lot
of
loving
at
the
front
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
thing
i
driving
at
happened
comparatively
recently
in
a
recent
attack
the
hun
set
to
work
to
knock
out
our
artillery
he
commenced
with
a
heavy
shelling
of
our
batteries
this
lasted
for
some
hours
he
followed
it
up
by
clapping
down
on
them
a
the
gunners
only
chance
of
protecting
themselves
from
the
deadly
fumes
was
to
wear
their
all
of
a
sudden
just
as
the
gassing
of
our
batteries
was
at
its
worst
all
along
our
rockets
commenced
to
go
up
our
infantry
if
they
actually
being
attacked
were
expecting
a
heavy
hun
and
were
calling
on
us
by
the
quickest
means
possible
to
help
them
of
a
there
are
two
men
who
can
not
do
their
work
accurately
in
one
of
these
is
the
layer
and
the
other
is
the
if
the
infantry
were
to
be
saved
two
men
out
of
the
detachment
of
each
protecting
gun
must
sacrifice
themselves
instantly
without
waiting
for
orders
the
and
layers
flung
aside
their
helmets
our
guns
opened
up
the
unmasked
men
lasted
about
twenty
minutes
when
they
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
choking
or
in
convulsions
two
more
took
their
places
without
a
second
hesitation
this
went
on
for
upwards
of
two
hours
the
reason
given
by
the
gunners
for
their
splendid
calculated
devotion
to
duty
was
that
they
were
going
to
let
their
pals
in
the
trenches
down
you
may
call
their
heroism
devotion
to
duty
or
anything
you
like
the
motive
that
inspired
it
was
love
when
men
having
done
their
bit
get
safely
home
from
the
front
and
have
the
chance
to
live
among
the
old
affections
and
enjoyments
the
memory
of
the
splendid
sharing
of
the
trenches
calls
them
back
that
memory
blots
out
all
the
tragedy
and
squalor
they
think
of
their
willing
comrades
in
sacrifice
and
can
not
rest
i
was
with
a
young
officer
who
was
probably
the
most
wounded
man
who
ever
came
out
of
france
alive
he
had
lain
for
months
in
hospital
between
sandbags
never
allowed
to
move
he
was
so
fragile
he
had
had
great
in
his
legs
and
stomach
the
artery
behind
his
left
ear
had
been
all
but
severed
when
he
was
at
last
well
enough
to
be
discharged
the
doctors
had
warned
him
never
to
play
golf
or
polo
or
to
take
any
violent
form
of
exercise
lest
he
should
do
himself
a
damage
he
had
returned
to
canada
for
a
rest
and
was
back
in
london
trying
to
get
sent
over
again
to
the
front
we
had
just
come
out
from
the
alhambra
whistles
were
being
blown
shrilly
for
taxis
london
were
slipping
cosily
through
the
muffled
darkness
a
man
and
girl
always
a
man
and
a
girl
they
walked
very
closely
usually
the
girl
was
laughing
suddenly
the
contrast
flashed
across
my
mind
between
this
bubbling
joy
of
living
and
the
poignant
silence
of
huddled
forms
beneath
the
same
starlight
not
a
hundred
miles
away
in
no
man
land
he
must
have
been
seeing
the
same
vision
and
making
the
same
contrast
he
pulled
on
my
arm
i
got
to
go
but
you
done
your
i
expostulated
if
you
do
go
back
and
do
get
hit
you
may
burst
a
blood
vessel
or
something
if
what
the
doctors
told
you
is
he
halted
me
beneath
an
i
could
see
the
earnestness
in
his
face
i
feel
about
it
this
way
he
said
if
i
out
there
i
just
one
more
a
lot
of
chaps
out
there
are
jolly
tired
if
i
was
there
i
be
able
to
give
some
chap
a
that
was
love
for
a
man
if
he
told
the
truth
would
say
i
hate
the
yet
most
of
us
if
you
ask
us
do
you
want
to
go
back
would
answer
yes
as
fast
as
i
why
partly
because
it
difficult
to
go
back
and
in
difficulty
lies
a
challenge
but
mostly
because
we
love
the
chaps
not
any
particular
chap
but
all
the
fellows
out
there
who
are
laughing
and
enduring
last
time
i
met
the
most
wounded
man
who
ever
came
out
of
france
alive
it
was
my
turn
to
be
in
hospital
he
came
to
visit
me
there
and
told
me
that
he
been
all
through
the
vimy
racket
and
was
again
going
back
but
how
did
you
manage
to
get
into
the
game
again
i
asked
i
thought
the
doctors
would
pass
he
laughed
slily
i
did
ask
the
doctors
if
you
know
the
right
people
these
things
can
always
be
more
than
half
of
the
bravery
at
the
front
is
due
to
our
love
of
the
folks
we
have
left
behind
we
proud
of
them
we
want
to
give
them
reason
to
be
proud
of
us
we
want
them
to
share
our
spirit
and
we
do
want
to
let
them
down
the
finest
reward
i
had
since
i
became
a
soldier
was
when
my
father
who
come
over
from
america
to
spend
my
ten
days
leave
with
me
in
london
saw
me
off
on
my
journey
back
to
france
i
recalled
his
despair
when
i
had
first
enlisted
and
compared
it
with
what
happened
now
we
were
at
the
where
we
had
to
part
i
said
to
him
if
you
knew
that
i
was
going
to
die
in
the
next
month
would
you
rather
i
stayed
or
went
much
rather
you
went
he
answered
those
words
made
me
feel
that
i
was
the
son
of
a
soldier
even
if
he
did
wear
mufti
one
would
have
to
play
the
game
pretty
low
to
let
a
father
like
that
down
when
you
come
to
consider
it
a
quitter
is
always
a
selfish
man
selfishness
that
makes
a
man
a
coward
or
a
deserter
if
he
in
a
dangerous
place
and
runs
away
all
he
doing
is
thinking
of
himself
i
been
supposed
to
be
talking
about
god
as
we
see
him
i
do
know
whether
i
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
had
asked
me
when
i
was
out
there
whether
there
was
any
religion
in
the
trenches
i
should
have
replied
certainly
now
that
i
been
out
of
the
fighting
for
a
while
i
see
that
there
is
religion
there
a
religion
which
will
dominate
the
world
when
the
war
is
ended
the
religion
of
heroism
it
a
religion
in
which
men
do
pray
much
with
me
before
i
went
to
the
front
prayer
was
a
habit
out
there
i
lost
the
habit
what
one
was
doing
seemed
sufficient
i
got
the
feeling
that
i
might
be
meeting
god
at
any
moment
so
i
did
need
to
be
worrying
him
all
the
time
hanging
on
to
a
spiritual
telephone
and
feeling
slighted
if
he
did
answer
me
directly
i
rang
him
up
if
god
was
really
interested
in
me
he
did
need
constant
reminding
when
he
had
a
world
to
manage
it
seemed
best
not
to
interrupt
him
with
frivolous
petitions
but
to
put
my
prayers
into
my
work
that
how
we
all
feel
out
there
god
as
we
see
him
i
could
have
told
you
how
i
saw
him
before
i
went
to
france
it
funny
you
go
away
to
the
most
damnable
undertaking
ever
invented
and
you
come
back
cleaner
in
spirit
the
one
thing
that
redeems
the
horror
is
that
it
does
make
a
man
momentarily
big
enough
to
be
in
sympathy
with
his
creator
he
gets
such
glimpses
of
him
in
his
fellows
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
it
was
rather
up
to
god
to
explain
himself
to
the
creatures
he
had
fashioned
since
then
i
acquired
the
point
of
view
of
a
soldier
i
learnt
discipline
and
my
own
total
unimportance
in
the
army
discipline
gets
possession
of
your
soul
you
learn
to
suppress
yourself
to
obey
implicitly
to
think
of
others
before
yourself
you
learn
to
jump
at
an
order
to
forsake
your
own
convenience
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
to
go
forward
on
the
most
lonely
and
dangerous
errands
without
complaining
you
learn
to
feel
that
there
is
only
one
thing
that
counts
in
life
and
only
one
thing
you
can
make
out
of
it
the
spirit
you
have
developed
in
encountering
its
difficulties
your
body
is
nothing
it
can
be
smashed
in
a
minute
how
frail
it
is
you
never
realise
until
you
have
seen
men
smashed
so
you
learn
to
tolerate
the
body
to
despise
death
and
to
place
all
your
reliance
on
courage
which
when
it
is
found
at
its
best
is
the
power
to
endure
for
the
sake
of
others
when
we
think
of
god
we
think
of
him
in
just
about
the
same
way
that
a
tommy
in
the
thinks
of
sir
douglas
haig
heaven
is
a
kind
of
general
headquarters
all
that
the
tommy
in
the
knows
of
an
offensive
is
that
orders
have
reached
him
through
the
appointed
authorities
that
at
zero
hour
he
will
climb
out
of
his
trench
and
go
over
the
top
to
meet
a
reasonable
chance
of
wounds
and
death
he
does
say
i
do
know
whether
i
will
climb
out
i
never
saw
sir
douglas
haig
there
may
be
any
such
person
i
want
to
have
a
chat
with
him
first
if
i
agree
with
him
after
that
i
may
go
over
the
top
and
then
again
i
may
not
we
see
about
instead
he
attributes
to
his
the
same
patriotism
love
of
duty
and
courage
which
he
himself
tries
to
practice
he
believes
that
if
he
and
sir
douglas
haig
were
to
change
places
sir
douglas
haig
would
be
quite
as
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
he
obeys
he
does
question
that
the
way
every
tommy
and
officer
comes
to
think
of
god
as
a
whom
he
has
never
seen
but
whose
orders
he
blindly
carries
out
the
religion
of
the
trenches
is
not
a
religion
which
analyses
god
with
impertinent
speculation
it
is
a
religion
which
takes
up
much
of
his
time
it
a
religion
which
teaches
men
to
carry
on
stoutly
and
to
say
i
tried
to
do
my
bit
as
best
i
know
how
i
guess
god
knows
it
if
i
west
he
remember
that
i
played
the
game
so
i
guess
he
forget
about
my
sins
and
take
me
to
that
is
the
simple
religion
of
the
trenches
as
i
have
learnt
it
a
religion
not
without
glory
to
carry
on
as
bravely
as
you
know
how
and
to
trust
god
without
worrying
him
the
end
