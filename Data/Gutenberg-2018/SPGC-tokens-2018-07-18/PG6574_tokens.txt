prefatory
note
this
volume
while
it
is
complete
in
itself
is
also
the
first
of
a
trilogy
the
scope
of
which
is
suggested
in
the
prologue
the
story
of
scientific
discovery
has
its
own
epic
unity
a
unity
of
purpose
and
endeavour
the
single
torch
passing
from
hand
to
hand
through
the
centuries
and
the
great
moments
of
science
when
after
long
labour
the
pioneers
saw
their
accumulated
facts
falling
into
a
significant
order
sometimes
in
the
form
of
a
law
that
revolutionised
the
whole
world
of
thought
have
an
intense
human
interest
and
belong
essentially
to
the
creative
imagination
of
poetry
it
is
with
these
moments
that
my
poem
is
chiefly
concerned
not
with
any
impossible
attempt
to
cover
the
whole
field
or
to
make
a
new
poetic
system
after
the
lucretian
model
out
of
modern
science
the
theme
has
been
in
my
mind
for
a
good
many
years
and
the
first
volume
dealing
with
the
watchers
of
the
sky
began
to
take
definite
shape
during
what
was
to
me
an
unforgettable
experience
the
night
i
was
privileged
to
spend
on
a
summit
of
the
sierra
madre
mountains
when
the
first
trial
was
made
of
the
new
telescope
the
prologue
to
this
volume
attempts
to
give
a
picture
of
that
night
and
to
elucidate
my
own
purpose
the
first
tale
in
this
volume
plunges
into
the
middle
of
things
with
the
revolution
brought
about
by
copernicus
but
within
the
tale
partly
by
means
of
an
incidental
lyric
there
is
an
attempt
to
give
a
view
of
what
had
gone
before
the
torch
then
passes
to
tycho
brahe
who
driven
into
exile
with
his
tables
of
the
stars
at
the
very
point
of
death
hands
them
over
to
a
young
man
named
kepler
kepler
with
their
help
arrives
at
his
own
great
laws
and
corresponds
with
galileo
the
intensely
human
drama
of
whose
life
i
have
endeavoured
to
depict
with
more
historical
accuracy
than
can
be
attributed
to
much
of
the
poetic
literature
that
has
gathered
around
his
name
too
many
writers
have
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
the
cry
e
pur
si
muove
it
is
of
course
rejected
by
every
reliable
historian
and
was
first
attributed
to
galileo
a
hundred
years
after
his
death
ponsard
in
his
play
on
the
subject
succumbed
to
the
extent
of
making
his
final
scene
end
with
galileo
frappant
du
pied
la
terre
and
crying
pourtant
elle
tourne
galileo
recantation
was
a
far
more
subtle
and
tragically
complicated
affair
than
that
even
landor
succumbed
to
the
easy
method
of
making
him
display
his
entirely
legendary
scars
to
milton
if
these
familiar
pictures
are
not
to
be
found
in
my
poem
it
may
be
well
for
me
to
assure
the
hasty
reader
that
it
is
because
i
have
endeavoured
to
present
a
more
just
picture
i
have
tried
to
suggest
the
complications
of
motive
in
this
section
by
a
series
of
letters
passing
between
the
characters
chiefly
concerned
there
was
of
course
a
certain
poetic
significance
in
the
legend
of
e
pur
si
muove
and
this
significance
i
have
endeavoured
to
retain
without
violating
historical
truth
in
the
year
of
galileo
death
newton
was
born
and
the
subsequent
sections
carry
the
story
on
to
the
modern
observatory
again
the
form
i
have
adopted
is
a
development
from
that
of
an
earlier
book
of
the
mermaid
where
certain
poets
and
discoverers
of
another
kind
were
brought
together
round
a
central
idea
and
their
stories
told
in
a
combination
of
narrative
and
lyrical
verse
the
flowed
all
the
more
naturally
into
a
similar
form
in
view
of
the
fact
that
tycho
brahe
kepler
and
many
other
pioneers
of
science
wrote
a
considerable
number
of
poems
those
imbedded
in
the
works
of
kepler
whose
blazing
and
fantastic
genius
was
indeed
primarily
poetic
are
of
extraordinary
interest
i
was
helped
too
in
the
general
scheme
by
those
constant
meetings
between
science
and
poetry
of
which
the
most
famous
and
beautiful
are
the
visit
of
sir
henry
wotton
to
kepler
and
the
visit
of
milton
to
galileo
in
prison
even
if
science
and
poetry
were
as
deadly
opposites
as
the
shallow
often
affirm
the
method
and
scheme
indicated
above
would
at
least
make
it
possible
to
convey
something
of
the
splendour
of
the
long
battle
for
the
light
in
its
most
human
aspect
poetry
has
its
own
precision
of
expression
and
in
modern
times
it
has
been
seeking
more
and
more
for
truth
sometimes
even
at
the
expense
of
beauty
it
may
be
possible
to
carry
that
quest
a
stage
farther
to
the
point
where
in
the
great
rhythmical
laws
of
the
universe
revealed
by
science
truth
and
beauty
are
reunited
if
poetry
can
do
this
it
will
not
be
without
some
value
to
science
itself
and
it
will
be
playing
its
part
in
the
reconstruction
of
a
shattered
world
the
passing
of
the
old
order
of
dogmatic
religion
has
left
the
modern
world
in
a
strange
chaos
craving
for
something
in
which
it
can
unfeignedly
believe
and
often
following
forty
years
ago
matthew
arnold
prophesied
that
it
would
be
for
poetry
where
it
is
worthy
of
its
high
destinies
to
help
to
carry
on
the
purer
fire
and
to
express
in
new
terms
those
eternal
ideas
which
must
ever
be
the
only
sure
stay
of
the
human
race
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
science
to
attempt
a
justification
of
the
ways
of
god
to
man
but
in
the
laws
of
nature
revealed
by
science
and
in
that
grand
sequence
of
events
which
as
darwin
affirmed
the
mind
refuses
to
accept
as
the
result
of
blind
chance
poetry
may
discover
its
own
new
grounds
for
the
attempt
it
is
easy
to
assume
that
all
hope
and
faith
are
shallow
it
is
even
easier
to
practise
a
really
shallow
and
devitalising
pessimism
the
modern
annunciation
that
there
is
a
skeleton
an
inch
beneath
the
skin
of
man
is
neither
new
nor
profound
neither
science
nor
poetry
can
rest
there
and
if
in
this
poem
an
attempt
is
made
to
show
that
spiritual
values
are
not
diminished
or
overwhelmed
by
the
fifteen
hundred
universes
that
passed
in
review
before
the
telescope
of
herschel
it
is
only
after
the
opposite
argument
so
common
and
so
easy
has
been
faced
and
only
after
poetry
has
at
least
endeavoured
to
follow
the
torch
of
science
to
its
own
in

prologue
the
observatory
at
noon
upon
the
mountain
purple
height
above
the
and
the
clouds
it
shone
no
larger
than
the
small
white
dome
of
shell
left
by
the
fledgling
wren
when
wings
are
born
by
night
it
joined
the
company
of
heaven
and
with
its
constant
light
became
a
star
a
of
light
minute
remote
it
sent
a
subtler
message
through
the
abyss
held
more
significance
for
the
seeing
eye
than
all
the
darkness
that
would
blot
it
out
yet
could
not
dwarf
it
high
in
heaven
it
shone
alive
with
all
the
thoughts
and
hopes
and
dreams
of
man
adventurous
mind
up
there
i
knew
the
explorers
of
the
sky
the
pioneers
of
science
now
made
ready
to
attack
that
darkness
once
again
and
win
new
worlds
night
they
hoped
to
crown
the
toil
of
twenty
years
and
turn
upon
the
sky
the
noblest
weapon
ever
made
by
man
war
had
delayed
them
they
had
been
drawn
away
designing
darker
weapons
but
no
gun
could
outrange
this
night
so
wrote
their
chief
we
try
our
great
new
telescope
the
your
milton
tube
has
grown
in
power
since
galileo
famous
blind
and
old
talked
with
him
in
that
prison
of
the
sky
we
creep
to
power
by
inches
europe
trusts
her
forty
still
even
our
own
old
sixty
has
its
work
to
do
and
now
our
i
hardly
dare
to
think
what
this
new
muzzle
of
ours
may
find
come
up
and
spend
that
night
among
the
stars
here
on
our
if
all
goes
well
then
at
the
least
my
friend
you
see
a
moon
stranger
but
nearer
many
a
thousand
mile
than
earth
has
ever
seen
her
even
in
dreams
as
for
the
stars
if
seeing
them
were
all
three
thousand
million
points
of
light
is
our
rough
guess
but
never
speak
of
this
you
know
our
press
they
miss
the
one
result
to
flash
thousand
millions
round
the
world
night
for
more
than
twenty
years
they
had
thought
and
planned
and
worked
ten
years
had
gone
or
more
of
man
brief
working
life
before
they
made
those
solid
tons
of
glass
their
reflector
the
clear
pool
the
polished
flawless
pool
that
it
must
be
to
hold
the
perfect
image
of
a
star
and
even
now
some
secret
flaw
none
knew
until
test
might
waste
it
all
where
was
the
gambler
that
would
stake
so
much
time
patience
treasure
on
a
single
throw
the
cost
of
it
they
not
find
that
again
either
in
gold
or
all
their
youth
was
fuel
to
the
flame
of
this
one
work
once
in
a
lifetime
to
the
man
of
science
despite
what
fools
believe
his
blood
there
comes
this
drama
if
he
fails
he
fails
utterly
he
at
least
will
have
no
time
for
fresh
beginnings
other
men
no
doubt
years
hence
will
use
the
footholes
that
he
cut
in
those
precipitous
cliffs
and
reach
the
height
but
he
will
never
see
it
so
for
me
the
light
words
of
that
letter
seemed
to
hide
the
passion
of
a
lifetime
and
i
shared
the
crowning
moment
of
its
hope
and
fear
next
day
through
whispering
aisles
of
palm
we
rode
up
to
the
dreaming
that
to
assuage
their
own
delicious
drought
had
set
each
tawny
slope
ablaze
with
peach
and
orange
orchards
up
and
up
along
the
thin
white
trail
that
wound
and
climbed
and
through
the
mountain
sage
the
car
went
crawling
till
the
shining
plain
below
it
like
an
airman
map
unrolled
houses
and
orchards
dwindled
to
white
specks
in
midget
cubes
and
squares
of
tufted
green
once
as
we
rounded
one
steep
curve
that
made
the
head
swim
at
the
canyoned
gulf
below
we
saw
through
thirty
miles
of
lucid
air
elvishly
small
sharp
as
a
crumpled
petal
blown
from
the
stem
a
yard
away
a
sail
lazily
drifting
on
the
warm
blue
sea
up
for
nine
miles
along
that
spiral
trail
slowly
we
wound
to
reach
the
lucid
height
above
the
clouds
where
that
white
dome
of
shell
no
wren
now
but
an
eagle
took
the
flush
of
dying
day
the
all
died
out
and
all
the
southern
growths
and
round
us
now
firs
of
the
north
and
strong
pines
exhaled
a
keener
fragrance
till
at
last
reversing
all
the
laws
of
lesser
hills
they
towered
like
giants
round
us
darkness
fell
before
we
reached
the
mountain
naked
height
over
us
like
some
great
cathedral
dome
the
observatory
loomed
against
the
sky
and
the
dark
mountain
with
its
headlong
gulfs
had
lost
all
memory
of
the
world
below
for
all
those
cloudless
throngs
of
glittering
stars
and
all
those
glimmerings
where
the
abyss
of
space
is
powdered
with
a
milky
dust
each
grain
a
burning
sun
and
every
sun
the
lord
of
its
own
darkling
planets
all
those
lights
met
in
a
darker
deep
the
lights
of
earth
lights
on
the
sea
lights
of
invisible
towns
trembling
and
indistinguishable
from
stars
in
those
black
gulfs
around
the
mountain
feet
then
into
the
glimmering
dome
with
bated
breath
we
entered
and
above
us
in
the
gloom
saw
that
majestic
weapon
of
the
light
uptowering
like
the
shaft
of
some
huge
gun
through
one
arched
rift
of
sky
dark
at
its
base
with
naked
arms
the
crew
that
all
day
long
had
sweated
to
make
ready
for
this
night
waited
their
captain
word
the
switchboard
shone
with
elfin
lamps
of
white
and
red
and
keys
whence
at
a
finger
touch
that
monstrous
tube
moved
like
a
creature
dowered
with
life
and
will
to
peer
from
deep
to
deep
below
it
pulsed
the
that
slowly
throb
by
throb
timed
to
the
pace
of
the
revolving
earth
drove
the
titanic
muzzle
on
and
on
fixed
to
the
chosen
star
that
else
would
glide
out
of
its
field
of
vision
so
set
free
balanced
against
the
wheel
of
time
it
swung
or
rested
while
to
find
new
realms
of
sky
the
dome
that
housed
it
like
a
moon
revolved
so
smoothly
that
the
watchers
hardly
knew
they
moved
within
till
through
the
glimmering
doors
they
saw
the
dark
procession
of
the
pines
like
indian
warriors
quietly
stealing
by
then
at
a
word
the
mighty
weapon
dipped
its
muzzle
and
aimed
at
one
small
point
of
light
one
seeming
insignificant
star
the
chief
mounting
the
ladder
while
we
held
our
breath
looked
through
the
then
we
heard
him
laugh
his
thanks
to
god
and
hide
it
in
a
jest
a
prominence
on
jupiter
they
laughed
what
do
you
mean
it
moving
cried
the
chief
they
laughed
again
and
watched
his
glimmering
face
high
overhead
against
that
moving
tower
come
up
and
see
then
one
by
one
they
went
and
though
each
laughed
as
he
returned
to
earth
their
souls
were
in
their
eyes
then
i
too
looked
and
saw
that
insignificant
spark
of
light
touched
with
new
meaning
beautifully
reborn
a
swimming
world
a
perfect
rounded
pearl
poised
in
the
violet
sky
and
as
i
gazed
i
saw
a
miracle
right
on
its
upmost
edge
a
tiny
mound
of
white
that
slowly
rose
then
like
an
exquisite
swung
quite
clear
and
swam
in
heaven
above
its
parent
world
to
greet
its
three
bright
a
moon
of
jupiter
no
more
but
clearer
far
than
mortal
eyes
had
seen
before
from
earth
o
beautiful
and
clear
beyond
all
dreams
was
that
one
silver
phrase
of
the
starry
tune
which
galileo
old
discoverer
first
dimly
revealed
dissolving
into
clouds
the
imagined
fabric
of
our
universe
jupiter
stands
in
heaven
and
will
stand
though
all
the
sycophants
bark
at
him
he
cried
hailing
the
truth
before
he
too
went
down
whelmed
in
the
cloudy
wreckage
of
that
dream
so
one
by
one
we
looked
the
men
who
served
urania
and
the
men
from
vulcan
forge
a
beautiful
eagerness
in
the
darkness
lit
the
swarthy
faces
that
too
long
had
missed
a
meaning
in
the
dull
mechanic
maze
of
labour
on
this
blind
earth
but
found
it
now
though
only
a
moment
wandering
melody
hopelessly
far
above
it
gave
their
toil
its
only
consecration
and
its
joy
there
with
eyes
and
naked
throats
grimed
and
smeared
with
and
sweat
they
gathered
round
the
foot
of
that
dim
ladder
each
muttering
low
as
he
came
down
his
wonder
at
what
he
saw
to
those
who
waited
a
picture
for
the
brush
of
rembrandt
lighted
only
by
the
rift
above
them
where
the
giant
muzzle
thrust
out
through
the
dim
arched
roof
and
slowly
throbbed
against
the
slowly
moving
wheel
of
the
earth
holding
their
chosen
star
there
like
an
elf
perched
on
the
side
of
that
dark
slanting
tower
the
italian
mechanician
watched
the
moons
that
italy
discovered
one
by
one
american
english
french
and
dutch
they
climbed
to
see
the
wonder
that
their
own
blind
hands
had
helped
to
achieve
at
midnight
while
they
paused
to
adjust
the
i
wandered
out
alone
into
the
silence
of
the
night
the
silence
on
that
lonely
height
i
heard
eternal
voices
for
as
i
looked
into
the
gulf
beneath
whence
almost
all
the
lights
had
vanished
now
the
whole
dark
mountain
seemed
to
have
lost
its
earth
and
to
be
sailing
like
a
ship
through
heaven
all
round
it
surged
the
mighty
sound
of
soughing
one
vast
ebb
and
flow
of
absolute
peace
aloof
from
all
earth
pain
so
calm
so
quiet
it
seemed
the
the
deep
soft
breathing
of
the
universe
over
its
youngest
child
the
soul
of
man
and
as
i
listened
that
aeolian
voice
became
an
invocation
and
a
prayer
o
you
that
on
your
loftier
mountain
dwell
and
move
like
light
in
light
among
the
thoughts
of
heaven
translating
our
mortality
into
immortal
song
is
there
not
one
among
you
that
can
turn
to
music
now
this
long
dark
fight
for
truth
not
one
to
touch
with
beauty
this
long
battle
for
the
light
this
little
victory
of
the
spirit
of
man
doomed
to
defeat
for
what
was
all
we
saw
to
that
which
neither
eyes
nor
soul
could
see
doomed
to
defeat
and
yet
unconquerable
climbing
its
nine
miles
nearer
to
the
stars
wars
we
have
sung
the
blind
kings
move
with
an
epic
music
to
their
thrones
have
you
no
song
then
of
that
nobler
war
of
those
who
strove
for
light
but
could
not
dream
even
of
this
victory
that
they
helped
to
win
silent
discoverers
lonely
pioneers
prisoners
and
exiles
martyrs
of
the
truth
who
handed
on
the
fire
from
age
to
age
of
those
who
step
by
step
drove
back
the
night
and
struggled
year
on
year
for
one
more
glimpse
among
the
stars
of
sovran
law
their
guide
of
those
who
searching
inward
saw
the
rocks
dissolving
into
a
new
abyss
and
saw
those
planetary
systems
far
within
atoms
electrons
whirling
on
their
way
to
build
and
to
unbuild
our
solid
world
of
those
who
conquered
inch
by
difficult
inch
the
freedom
of
this
realm
of
law
for
man
dreamers
of
dreams
the
builders
of
our
hope
the
healers
and
the
binders
up
of
wounds
who
while
the
dynasts
drenched
the
world
with
blood
would
in
the
still
small
circle
of
a
lamp
wrestle
with
death
like
heracles
of
old
to
save
one
stricken
child
is
there
no
song
to
touch
this
moving
universe
of
law
with
ultimate
light
the
glimmer
of
that
great
dawn
which
over
our
ruined
altars
yet
shall
break
in
purer
splendour
and
restore
mankind
from
darker
dreams
than
even
lucretius
knew
to
vision
of
that
one
power
which
guides
the
world
how
should
men
find
it
only
through
those
doors
which
opening
inward
in
each
separate
soul
give
each
man
access
to
that
soul
of
all
living
within
each
life
not
to
be
found
or
known
till
looking
inward
each
alone
meets
the
unknowable
and
eternal
god
and
there
was
one
that
moved
like
light
in
light
before
me
there
love
human
and
divine
that
can
exalt
all
weakness
into
power
whispering
this
deathless
torch
of
whispering
but
with
such
faith
that
even
i
was
humbled
into
thinking
this
might
be
through
love
though
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
account
it
folly
let
my
breast
be
bared
to
every
shaft
then
so
that
love
be
still
my
one
celestial
guide
the
while
i
sing
of
those
who
caught
the
pure
promethean
fire
one
from
another
each
crying
as
he
went
down
to
one
that
waited
crowned
with
youth
and
joy
thou
the
splendour
carry
it
out
of
sight
into
the
great
new
age
i
must
not
know
into
the
great
new
realm
i
must
not
i
copernicus
the
neighbours
gossiped
idly
at
the
door
copernicus
lay
dying
overhead
his
little
throng
of
friends
with
startled
eyes
whispered
together
in
that
dark
house
of
dreams
from
which
by
one
dim
crevice
in
the
wall
he
used
to
watch
the
stars
his
book
has
come
from
nuremberg
at
last
but
who
would
dare
to
let
him
see
it
now
they
have
altered
it
though
rome
approved
in
full
this
preface
look
declares
that
his
discoveries
are
a
dream
he
has
asked
a
thousand
times
if
it
has
come
could
we
tear
out
those
pages
he
suspect
what
shall
be
done
then
hold
it
back
awhile
that
was
the
priest
voice
in
the
room
above
he
may
forget
it
those
last
sacraments
may
set
his
mind
at
rest
and
bring
him
peace
then
stealing
quietly
to
that
upper
door
they
opened
it
a
little
and
saw
within
the
lean
white
deathbed
of
copernicus
who
made
our
world
a
world
without
an
end
there
in
that
narrow
room
they
saw
his
face
grey
seamed
with
thought
lit
by
a
single
lamp
they
saw
those
glorious
eyes
closing
that
once
had
looked
beyond
the
spheres
and
seen
our
ancient
firmaments
dissolve
into
a
boundless
night
beside
him
knelt
two
women
like
bowed
shadows
at
his
feet
an
old
physician
watched
him
at
his
head
the
cowled
franciscan
murmured
while
the
light
shone
faintly
on
the
chalice
all
grew
still
the
fragrance
of
the
wine
was
like
faint
flowers
the
first
breath
of
those
far
celestial
fields
then
like
a
dying
soldier
that
must
leave
his
last
command
to
others
while
the
fight
is
yet
uncertain
and
the
victory
far
copernicus
whispered
in
a
fevered
dream
yes
it
is
death
but
you
must
hold
him
back
there
in
the
doorway
for
a
little
while
until
i
know
the
work
is
rightly
done
use
all
your
weapons
doctor
i
must
live
to
see
and
touch
one
copy
of
my
book
have
they
not
brought
it
yet
they
promised
me
it
should
be
here
by
nightfall
one
of
you
go
and
hasten
it
i
can
hold
back
death
till
dawn
have
they
not
brought
it
yet
from
nuremberg
do
not
deceive
me
i
must
know
it
safe
printed
and
safe
for
other
men
to
use
i
could
die
then
my
use
would
be
fulfilled
what
has
delayed
them
will
not
some
one
go
and
tell
them
that
my
strength
is
running
out
tell
them
that
book
would
be
an
angel
hand
in
mine
an
easier
pillow
for
my
head
a
little
lantern
in
the
engulfing
dark
you
see
i
hid
its
struggling
light
so
long
under
too
small
a
bushel
and
i
fear
it
may
go
out
forever
in
the
noon
of
life
brief
day
i
could
not
see
the
need
as
now
i
see
it
when
the
night
shuts
down
i
was
afraid
perhaps
it
might
confuse
the
lights
that
guide
us
for
the
souls
of
men
but
now
i
see
three
stages
in
our
life
at
first
we
bask
contented
in
our
sun
and
take
what
daylight
shows
us
for
the
truth
then
we
discover
in
some
midnight
grief
how
all
day
long
the
sunlight
blinded
us
to
depths
beyond
where
all
our
knowledge
dies
that
where
men
shrink
and
lose
their
way
in
doubt
then
last
as
death
draws
nearer
comes
a
night
in
whose
majestic
shadow
men
see
god
absolute
knowledge
reconciling
all
so
all
my
life
i
pondered
on
that
scheme
which
makes
this
earth
the
centre
of
all
worlds
lighted
and
wheeled
around
by
sun
and
moon
and
that
great
crystal
sphere
wherein
men
thought
myriads
of
lesser
stars
were
fixed
like
lamps
each
in
its
place
one
mighty
glittering
wheel
revolving
round
this
dark
abode
of
man
night
after
night
with
even
pace
they
moved
year
after
year
not
altering
by
one
point
their
order
or
their
stations
those
fixed
stars
in
that
revolving
firmament
the
plough
still
pointed
to
the
pole
fixed
in
their
sphere
how
else
explain
that
vast
unchanging
wheel
how
but
by
thinking
all
those
lesser
lights
were
huger
suns
divided
from
our
earth
by
so
immense
a
gulf
that
if
they
moved
ten
thousand
leagues
an
hour
among
themselves
it
would
not
seem
one
to
our
eyes
utterly
inconceivable
i
know
and
yet
we
daily
kneel
to
boundless
power
and
build
our
hope
on
that
infinitude
this
did
not
daunt
me
then
indeed
i
saw
light
upon
chaos
many
discordant
dreams
began
to
move
in
lucid
music
now
for
what
could
be
more
baffling
than
the
thought
that
those
enormous
heavens
must
circle
earth
diurnally
a
journey
that
would
need
swiftness
to
which
the
lightning
flash
would
seem
a
white
slug
creeping
on
the
walls
of
night
while
if
earth
softly
on
her
axle
spun
one
quiet
revolution
answered
all
it
was
our
moving
selves
that
made
the
sky
seem
to
revolve
have
not
all
ages
seen
a
like
illusion
baffling
half
mankind
in
life
thought
art
men
think
at
every
turn
of
their
own
souls
the
very
heavens
have
moved
light
upon
chaos
light
and
yet
more
light
for
as
i
watched
the
planets
venus
mars
appeared
to
wax
and
wane
from
month
to
month
as
though
they
moved
now
near
now
far
from
earth
earth
could
not
be
their
centre
was
the
sun
their
sovran
lord
then
as
pythagoras
held
was
this
great
earth
so
so
secure
a
planet
also
did
it
also
move
around
the
sun
if
this
were
true
my
friends
no
revolution
in
this
world
affairs
not
that
blind
maelstrom
where
imperial
rome
went
down
into
the
dark
could
so
engulf
all
that
we
thought
we
knew
we
who
believed
in
our
own
majesty
we
who
walked
with
gods
as
younger
sons
on
this
proud
central
stage
round
which
the
whole
bright
firmament
revolved
for
our
especial
glory
must
we
creep
like
ants
upon
our
midget
ball
of
dust
lost
in
immensity
i
could
not
take
that
darkness
lightly
i
withheld
my
book
for
many
a
year
until
i
clearly
saw
and
rome
approved
me
have
they
not
brought
it
yet
that
this
tremendous
music
could
not
drown
the
still
supernal
music
of
the
soul
or
quench
the
light
that
shone
when
christ
was
born
for
who
if
one
lost
star
could
lead
the
kings
to
god
own
son
would
shrink
from
following
these
to
his
eternal
throne
this
at
the
least
we
know
the
soul
of
man
can
soar
through
heaven
it
is
our
own
wild
wings
that
dwarf
the
world
to
nothingness
beneath
us
let
the
soul
take
courage
then
if
its
own
thought
be
true
not
all
the
immensities
of
little
minds
can
ever
quench
its
own
celestial
fire
no
this
new
night
was
needed
that
the
soul
might
conquer
its
own
kingdom
and
arise
to
its
full
stature
so
in
face
of
death
i
saw
that
i
must
speak
the
truth
i
knew
have
they
not
brought
it
what
delays
my
book
i
am
afraid
tell
me
the
truth
my
friends
at
this
last
hour
the
church
may
yet
withhold
her
sanction
not
the
church
but
those
who
think
a
little
darkness
helps
her
were
this
true
they
would
do
well
if
the
poor
light
we
win
confuse
or
blind
us
to
the
light
of
lights
let
all
our
wisdom
perish
i
affirm
a
greater
darkness
where
the
one
true
church
shall
after
all
her
agonies
of
loss
and
many
an
age
of
doubt
perhaps
to
come
see
this
processional
host
of
splendours
burn
like
tapers
round
her
altar
so
i
speak
not
for
myself
but
for
the
age
unborn
i
caught
the
fire
from
those
who
went
before
the
bearers
of
the
torch
who
could
not
see
the
goal
to
which
they
strained
i
caught
their
fire
and
carried
it
only
a
little
way
beyond
but
there
are
those
that
wait
for
it
i
know
those
who
will
carry
it
on
to
victory
i
dare
not
fail
them
looking
back
i
see
those
others
fallen
with
their
arms
outstretched
dead
pointing
to
the
future
far
far
back
before
the
egyptians
built
their
pyramids
with
those
dark
funnels
pointing
to
the
north
through
which
the
pharaohs
from
their
desert
tombs
gaze
all
night
long
upon
the
polar
star
some
wandering
arab
crept
from
death
to
life
led
by
the
plough
across
those
wastes
of
pearl
long
long
ago
have
they
not
brought
it
yet
my
book
i
finished
it
one
summer
night
and
felt
my
blood
all
beating
into
song
i
meant
to
print
those
verses
in
my
book
a
prelude
hinting
at
that
deeper
night
which
darkens
all
our
knowledge
then
i
thought
the
measure
moved
too
lightly
do
you
recall
those
verses
elsa
they
would
pass
the
time
how
happy
i
was
the
night
i
wrote
that
song
then
one
of
those
bowed
shadows
raised
her
head
and
like
a
mother
crooning
to
her
child
murmured
the
words
he
wrote
so
long
ago
in
old
cathay
in
far
cathay
before
the
western
world
began
they
saw
the
moving
fount
of
day
eclipsed
as
by
a
shadowy
fan
they
stood
upon
their
chinese
wall
they
saw
his
fire
to
ashes
fade
and
felt
the
deeper
slumber
fall
on
domes
of
pearl
and
towers
of
jade
with
slim
brown
hands
in
araby
they
traced
upon
the
desert
sand
their
rams
and
scorpions
of
the
sky
and
strove
and
failed
to
understand
before
their
footprints
were
effaced
the
shifting
sand
forgot
their
rune
their
hieroglyphs
were
all
erased
their
desert
naked
to
the
moon
in
bagdad
of
the
purple
nights
haroun
al
raschid
built
a
tower
where
sages
watched
a
thousand
lights
and
read
their
legends
for
an
hour
the
tower

caliph

their
astrolabes
are
wrecked
with

in
babylon
they
baked
their
tablets
of
the
clay
and
year
by
year
inscribed
thereon
the
dark
eclipses
of
their
day
they
saw
the
moving
finger
write
its
on
their
sun
a
mightier
shadow
cloaks
their
light
and
clay
is

a
shadow
moved
towards

from
the
door

with
a
cry
upraised
his
head
the

i
can
not
see
it
let
me
feel
the
lettering
on
the
cover
it
is
here
put
out
the
lamp
now
draw
those
curtains
back
and
let
me
die
with
starlight
on
my
face
an
angel
hand
in
mine
yes
i
can
say
my
now
light
and
more
light
in
that
pure
realm
whose
darkness
is
our
peace
ii
tycho
brake
i
they
thought
him
a
magician
tycho
brahe
who
lived
on
that
strange
island
in
the
sound
nine
miles
from
elsinore
his
legend
reached
the
mermaid
inn
the
year
that
shakespeare
died
fynes
moryson
had
brought
his
travellers
tales
of
wheen
the
isle
where
tycho
made
his
great
discoveries
and
with
jeppe
his
dwarf
and
christine
the
peasant
girl
dreamed
his
great
dreams
for
years
for
there
he
lit
that
lanthorn
of
the
law
uraniborg
that
fortress
of
the
truth
with
pegasus
flying
above
its
loftiest
tower
while
in
its
roofs
like
wide
enchanted
eyes
watching
the
brightest
windows
in
the
world
opened
upon
the
stars
nine
miles
from
elsinore
with
all
those
ghosts
there
magic
enough
in
that
but
wheen
six
miles
in
girth
with
crowds
of
hunchback
waves
crawling
all
round
it
and
those
moonstruck
windows
held
its
own
magic
too
for
tycho
brahe
by
his
mysterious
alchemy
of
dreams
had
so
enriched
the
soil
that
when
the
king
of
england
wished
to
buy
it
denmark
asked
a
price
too
great
for
any
king
on
earth
give
us
they
said
in
scarlet
cardinal
cloth
enough
to
cover
it
and
at
every
corner
of
every
piece
a
right
too
then
all
that
kings
can
buy
of
wheen
is
yours
only
said
they
a
merchant
bought
it
once
and
when
he
came
to
claim
it
goblins
flocked
all
round
him
from
its
forty
goblin
farms
and
mocked
him
bidding
him
take
away
the
stones
that
he
had
bought
for
nothing
else
was
his
these
things
were
fables
they
were
also
true
they
thought
him
a
magician
tycho
brahe
the
astrologer
who
wore
the
mask
of
gold
perhaps
he
was
there
magic
in
the
truth
and
only
those
who
find
and
follow
its
laws
can
work
its
miracles
tycho
sought
the
truth
from
that
strange
year
in
boyhood
when
he
heard
the
great
eclipse
foretold
and
on
the
day
appointed
at
the
very
minute
even
beheld
the
weirdly
punctual
shadow
creep
across
the
sun
bewildering
all
the
birds
with
thoughts
of
evening
picture
him
on
that
day
the
boy
at
copenhagen
with
his
mane
of
thick
red
hair
thrusting
his
freckled
face
out
of
his
upper
window
holding
the
piece
of
glass
he
blackened
above
his
to
watch
that
orange
ember
in
the
sky
wane
into
smouldering
ash
he
whispered
there
so
it
is
true
by
searching
in
the
heavens
men
can
foretell
the
future
in
the
street
below
him
throngs
were
babbling
of
the
plague
that
might
or
might
not
follow
he
resolved
to
make
himself
the
master
of
that
deep
art
and
know
what
might
be
known
he
bought
the
books
of
stadius
with
his
tables
of
the
stars
night
after
night
among
the
gabled
roofs
climbing
and
creeping
through
a
world
unknown
save
to
the
roosting
stork
he
learned
to
find
the
constellations
cassiopeia
throne
the
plough
still
pointing
to
the
polar
star
the
of
orion
there
he
watched
the
movements
of
the
planets
hours
on
hours
and
wondered
at
the
mystery
of
it
all
all
this
he
did
in
secret
for
his
birth
was
noble
and
such
wonderings
were
a
sign
of
low
estate
when
tycho
brahe
was
young
and
all
his
kinsmen
hoped
that
tycho
brahe
would
live
serene
as
they
among
his
dogs
and
horses
or
if
honour
must
be
won
let
the
superfluous
glory
flow
from
fields
where
blood
might
still
be
shed
or
from
those
courts
where
statesmen
lie
but
tycho
sought
the
truth
so
when
they
sent
him
in
his
tutor
charge
to
leipzig
for
such
studies
as
they
held
more
worthy
of
his
princely
blood
he
searched
the
almagest
and
while
his
tutor
slept
measured
the
delicate
angles
of
the
stars
out
of
his
window
with
his
compasses
his
only
instrument
even
with
this
rude
aid
he
found
so
many
an
ancient
record
wrong
that
more
and
more
he
burned
to
find
the
truth
one
night
at
home
as
tycho
searched
the
sky
out
of
his
window
compasses
in
hand
fixing
one
point
upon
a
planet
one
upon
some
loftier
star
a
ripple
of
laughter
startled
him
from
the
garden
walk
below
he
lowered
his
compass
peered
into
the
dark
and
saw
christine
the
peasant
girl
with
bare
brown
feet
standing
among
the
flowers
she
held
what
seemed
an
apple
in
her
hand
and
in
a
voice
that
aprilled
all
his
blood
the
low
soft
voice
of
earth
drawing
him
down
from
those
cold
heights
to
that
warm
breast
of
spring
a
natural
voice
that
had
not
learned
to
use
the
false
tones
of
the
world
simple
and
clear
as
a
bird
voice
out
of
the
fragrant
darkness
called
i
saw
it
falling
from
your
i
thought
it
was
an
apple
till
it
rolled
over
my
foot
it
heavy
shall
i
try
to
throw
it
back
to
you
tycho
saw
a
stain
of
purple
across
one
small
arched
glistening
foot
your
foot
is
bruised
he
cried
o
no
she
laughed
and
plucked
the
stain
off
only
a
petal
see
she
showed
it
to
him
but
this
i
wonder
now
if
i
can
throw
it
twice
she
tried
and
failed
or
tycho
failed
to
catch
that
slippery
sphere
he
saw
the
supple
body
swaying
below
the
ripe
red
lips
that
parted
as
she
laughed
and
those
deep
eyes
where
all
the
stars
were
drowned
at
the
third
time
he
caught
it
and
she
vanished
waving
her
hand
a
little
floating
moth
between
the
into
the
warm
dark
night
he
turned
into
his
room
and
quickly
thrust
under
his
pillow
that
forbidden
fruit
for
the
door
opened
and
the
hot
red
face
of
otto
brahe
his
father
glowered
at
him
what
this
what
this
the
old
man
limped
to
the
bedside
pulled
the
mystery
out
and
stared
upon
the
strangest
apple
of
eve
that
ever
troubled
eden
heavy
as
bronze
and
delicately
enchased
with
silver
stars
the
small
celestial
globe
that
tycho
bought
in
leipzig
then
the
storm
burst
on
his
head
this
work
these
gypsy
tricks
would
damn
the
mother
of
any
knutsdorp
squire
and
crown
his
father
like
a
stag
of
ten
quarrel
on
quarrel
followed
from
that
night
till
tycho
sickened
of
his
ancient
name
and
wandering
through
the
woods
about
his
home
found
on
a
ringed
with
fragrant
pines
a
little
open
glade
of
whispering
ferns
thither
at
night
he
stole
to
watch
the
stars
and
there
he
told
the
oldest
tale
on
earth
to
one
that
watched
beside
him
one
whose
eyes
shone
with
true
love
more
beautiful
than
the
stars
a
daughter
of
earth
the
christine
they
met
there
in
the
dusk
on
his
last
night
at
home
before
he
went
to
wittenberg
they
stood
among
the
whispering
ferns
and
said
i
shall
return
he
said
and
shame
them
for
their
folly
who
would
set
their
pride
above
the
stars
christine
and
you
at
wittenberg
or
rostoch
i
shall
find
more
chances
and
more
knowledge
all
those
worlds
are
still
to
conquer
we
know
nothing
yet
the
books
are
crammed
with
fables
they
foretell
here
an
eclipse
and
there
a
dawning
moon
but
most
of
them
were
out
a
month
or
more
on
jupiter
and
saturn
there
one
way
and
only
one
to
knowledge
of
the
law
whereby
the
stars
are
steered
and
so
to
read
the
future
even
perhaps
the
destinies
of
men
and
nations
only
one
sure
way
and
that
to
watch
them
watch
them
and
record
the
truth
we
know
and
not
the
lies
we
dream
dear
while
i
watch
them
though
the
hills
and
sea
divide
us
every
night
our
eyes
can
meet
among
those
constant
glories
every
night
your
eyes
and
mine
upraised
to
that
bright
realm
can
in
one
moment
speak
across
the
world
i
shall
come
back
with
knowledge
and
with
power
and
you
will
wait
for
me
she
answered
him
in
silence
with
the
starlight
of
her
eyes
ii
he
watched
the
skies
at
wittenberg
the
plague
drove
him
to
rostoch
and
he
watched
them
there
but
even
there
the
plague
of
little
minds
beset
him
at
a
he
met
his
noble
countryman
manderup
who
asked
with
mocking
courtesy
whether
tycho
brahe
was
ready
yet
to
practise
his
black
art
at
country
fairs
the
guests
and
tycho
laughed
whereat
the
swaggering
junker
blandly
sneered
if
fail
christine
will
dance
thus
tambourine
on
hip
he
struck
a
pose
her
pretty
feet
will
pack
that
booth
of
yours
they
fought
at
midnight
in
a
wood
with
swords
and
not
a
spark
of
light
but
those
that
leapt
blue
from
the
clashing
blades
tycho
had
lost
his
moon
and
stars
awhile
almost
his
life
for
in
one
furious
bout
his
enemy
blade
dashed
like
a
scribble
of
lightning
into
the
face
of
tycho
brahe
and
left
him
spluttering
blood
groping
through
that
dark
wood
with
outstretched
hands
to
fall
in
a
swoon
they
carried
him
back
to
rostoch
and
when
tycho
saw
at
last
that
mirrored
patch
of
mutilated
flesh
seared
as
by
fire
between
the
frank
blue
eyes
and
firm
young
mouth
where
like
a
living
flower
upon
some
stricken
tree
youth
lingered
still
he
but
one
thought
christine
would
shrink
from
him
in
fear
or
worse
in
pity
an
end
had
come
worse
than
old
age
to
all
the
glory
of
youth
urania
would
not
let
her
lover
stray
into
a
mortal
arms
he
must
remain
her
own
for
ever
and
for
ever
alone
yet
as
the
days
went
by
to
face
the
world
he
made
himself
a
delicate
mask
of
gold
and
silver
shaped
like
those
that
minstrels
wear
at
carnival
in
venice
or
when
love
disguising
its
disguise
of
mortal
flesh
wooes
as
a
nameless
prince
from
far
away
and
when
this
world
day
with
its
blaze
and
coil
was
ended
and
the
first
white
star
awoke
in
that
pure
realm
where
all
our
tumults
die
his
eyes
and
hers
meeting
on
hesperus
renewed
their
troth
he
seemed
to
see
christine
ringed
by
the
on
that
distant
hill
a
small
white
figure
lost
in
space
and
time
yet
gazing
at
the
sky
and
conquering
all
height
depth
and
heaven
itself
by
the
sheer
power
of
love
at
one
with
everlasting
laws
a
love
that
shared
the
constancy
of
heaven
and
spoke
to
him
across
above
the
world
iii
not
till
he
crossed
the
danube
did
he
find
among
the
fountains
and
the
storied
eaves
of
augsburg
one
to
share
his
task
with
him
paul
hainzel
of
that
city
greatly
loved
to
talk
with
tycho
of
the
strange
new
dreams
copernicus
had
kindled
did
this
earth
move
was
the
sun
the
centre
of
our
scheme
and
tycho
told
him
there
is
but
one
way
to
know
the
truth
and
that
to
sweep
aside
all
the
dark
cobwebs
of
old
sophistry
and
watch
and
learn
that
moving
alphabet
each
smallest
silver
character
inscribed
upon
the
skies
themselves
noting
them
down
till
on
a
day
we
find
them
taking
shape
in
phrases
with
a
meaning
and
at
last
the
beauty
of
that
celestial
book
with
all
its
epic
harmonies
unfold
like
some
great
poet
universal
song
he
was
a
great
magician
tycho
brahe
hainzel
he
said
we
have
no
magic
wand
but
what
the
truth
can
give
us
if
we
find
even
with
a
compass
through
a
bedroom
window
that
half
the
glittering
almagest
is
wrong
think
you
what
noble
conquests
might
be
ours
had
we
but
nobler
instruments
he
showed
quivering
with
eagerness
his
first
rude
plan
for
that
great
quadrant
not
the
wooden
toy
of
old
scultetus
but
a
kingly
weapon
huge
as
a
roman
and
fine
in
its
divisions
as
any
goldsmith
work
it
could
be
built
said
tycho
but
the
cost
would
buy
a
dozen
culverin
for
your
wars
then
hainzel
fired
by
tycho
burning
brain
answered
we
make
it
we
a
war
to
wage
on
chaos
and
his
kingdoms
of
the
night
they
chose
the
cunningest
artists
of
the
town
jewellers
carpenters
and
smiths
and
setting
them
all
afire
with
tycho
dream
within
a
month
his
dream
was
oak
and
brass
its
beams
were
fourteen
cubits
solid
oak
banded
with
iron
its
arch
was
polished
brass
whereon
five
thousand
exquisite
divisions
were
marked
to
show
the
minutes
of
degrees
so
huge
and
heavy
it
was
a
score
of
men
could
hardly
drag
and
fix
it
to
its
place
in
hainzel
garden
many
a
shining
night
tycho
and
hainzel
out
of
that
maze
of
flowers
charted
the
stars
discovering
point
by
point
how
all
the
records
erred
until
the
fame
of
this
new
master
hovering
above
the
schools
like
a
strange
hawk
threatened
the
creeping
dreams
of
all
the
aristotelians
and
began
to
set
their
twittering
tycho
brahe
then
tycho
brahe
came
home
to
find
christine
up
to
that
whispering
glade
of
ferns
he
sped
at
the
first
wink
of
hesperus
he
stood
in
shadow
under
the
darkest
pine
to
hide
the
little
golden
mask
upon
his
face
he
wondered
will
she
shrink
from
me
in
fear
or
loathing
will
she
even
come
at
all
and
as
he
wondered
like
a
light
she
moved
before
him
is
it
you
christine
christine
he
whispered
it
is
i
the
mountebank
playing
a
jest
upon
you
it
only
a
mask
do
not
be
frightened
i
am
here
behind
it
her
red
lips
parted
and
between
them
shone
the
little
teeth
like
white
pomegranate
seeds
he
saw
her
frightened
eyes
then
with
a
cry
her
arms
went
round
him
and
her
eyelids
closed
lying
against
his
heart
she
set
her
lips
against
his
lips
and
claimed
him
for
her
own
iv
one
frosty
night
as
tycho
bent
his
way
home
to
the
dark
old
abbey
he
upraised
his
eyes
and
saw
a
portent
in
the
sky
there
in
its
most
familiar
patch
of
blue
where
cassiopeia
glory
burned
an
unknown
brilliance
quivered
a
huge
star
unseen
before
a
strange
new
visitant
to
heavens
unchangeable
as
the
world
believed
since
the
creation
could
new
stars
be
born
night
after
night
he
watched
that
miracle
growing
and
changing
colour
as
it
grew
white
at
the
first
and
large
as
jupiter
and
in
the
third
month
yellow
and
larger
yet
red
in
the
fifth
month
like
aldebaran
and
larger
even
than
lyra
in
the
seventh
bluish
like
saturn
whence
it
dulled
and
dwined
little
by
little
till
after
eight
months
more
into
the
dark
abysmal
blue
of
night
whence
it
arose
the
wonder
died
away
but
while
it
blazed
above
him
tycho
brought
those
delicate
records
of
two
hundred
nights
to
copenhagen
there
in
his
golden
mask
at
supper
with
pratensis
who
believed
only
what
old
books
told
him
tycho
met
dancey
the
french
ambassador
in
satin
hose
and
doublet
supple
and
thin
and
bearded
with
a
soft
black
tuft
neat
as
a
blackbird
wing
a
spirit
as
keen
and
swift
as
france
on
all
the
starry
trails
of
thought
he
saw
the
deep
and
simple
fire
the
mystery
of
all
genius
in
those
eyes
above
that
golden
wizard
tycho
raised
his
brimming
they
thought
with
purple
dreams
and
bade
them
drink
to
their
triumphant
queen
of
all
the
muses
to
their
lady
of
light
urania
and
the
great
new
star
they
laughed
thinking
the
young
astrologer
golden
mask
hid
a
sardonic
jest
the
skies
are
clear
said
tycho
brahe
and
we
have
eyes
to
see
put
out
your
candles
open
those
windows
there
the
colder
darkness
breathed
upon
their
brows
and
tycho
pointed
into
the
deep
blue
night
there
in
their
most
immutable
height
of
heaven
in
in
the
ethereal
realm
beyond
all
planets
red
as
mars
it
burned
the
one
impossible
glory
but
it
true
pratensis
gasped
then
clutching
the
first
straw
now
i
recall
how
pliny
the
elder
said
hipparchus
also
saw
a
strange
new
star
not
where
the
comets
not
where
the
bloom
and
fade
but
in
that
solid
crystal
sphere
where
nothing
changes
tycho
smiled
and
showed
the
record
of
his
watchings
but
the
world
must
know
all
this
cried
dancey
you
must
print
it
print
it
said
tycho
turning
that
golden
mask
on
both
his
friends
could
i
a
noble
print
this
trafficking
with
urania
in
a
book
they
hound
me
out
of
denmark
this
disgrace
of
work
with
hands
or
brain
no
matter
why
no
matter
how
in
one
who
ought
to
dwell
fixed
to
the
solid
upper
sphere
my
friends
would
never
be
forgiven
dancey
stared
in
mute
amazement
but
that
mask
of
gold
outstared
him
and
inscrutable
soon
through
all
europe
like
the
blinded
moths
roused
by
a
lantern
in
old
palaces
among
the
mouldering
tapestries
of
thought
weird
fables
woke
and
fluttered
to
and
fro
and
sages
hunted
them
for
truth
the
italian
frangipani
thought
the
star
the
lost
electra
that
had
left
her
throne
among
the
pleiads
and
plunged
into
the
night
like
a
veiled
mourner
when
troy
town
was
burned
the
german
painter
busch
of
erfurt
wrote
it
was
a
comet
made
of
mortal
sins
a
poisonous
mist
touched
by
the
wrath
of
god
to
fire
from
which
there
would
descend
on
earth
all
manner
of
evil
plagues
and
sudden
death
frenchmen
and
famine
preachers
thumped
and
raved
theodore
beza
in
calvin
pulpit
tore
his
grim
black
gown
and
vowed
it
was
the
star
that
led
the
magi
it
had
now
returned
to
mark
the
world
end
and
the
judgment
day
then
in
this
hubbub
dancey
told
the
king
of
denmark
there
is
one
who
knows
the
truth
your
subject
tycho
brahe
who
night
by
night
watched
and
recorded
all
that
truth
could
see
it
would
bring
honour
to
all
denmark
sire
if
tycho
could
forget
his
rank
awhile
and
print
these
great
discoveries
in
a
book
for
all
the
world
to
read
so
tycho
brahe
received
a
letter
in
the
king
own
hand
urging
him
truth
is
the
one
pure
of
all
nobility
pray
forget
your
rank
his
noble
kinsmen
echoed
if
you
wish
to
please
his
majesty
and
ourselves
forget
your
rank
i
will
said
tycho
brahe
your
reasoning
has
convinced
me
i
will
print
my
book
nova
and
to
prove
all
you
have
said
concerning
temporal
rank
and
this
eternal
truth
you
love
so
well
i
marry
they
foamed
but
all
their
mouths
were
stopped
and
stuffed
and
sealed
with
their
own
words
i
marry
my
own
true
love
christine
v
they
thought
him
a
magician
tycho
brahe
perhaps
he
was
there
magic
all
around
us
in
rocks
and
trees
and
in
the
minds
of
men
deep
hidden
springs
of
magic
he
that
strikes
the
rock
aright
may
find
them
where
he
will
and
tycho
tasted
happiness
in
his
hour
there
was
a
prince
in
denmark
in
those
days
and
when
he
heard
how
other
kings
desired
the
secrets
of
this
new
astrology
he
said
this
man
in
after
years
will
bring
glory
to
denmark
honour
to
her
prince
he
is
a
dane
give
him
this
isle
of
wheen
and
let
him
make
his
great
discoveries
there
let
him
have
gold
to
buy
his
instruments
and
build
his
house
and
his
observatory
so
tycho
set
this
island
where
he
lived
whispering
with
wizardry
and
in
its
heart
he
lighted
that
strange
lanthorn
of
the
law
and
built
himself
that
wonder
of
the
world
uraniborg
a
fortress
for
the
truth
a
city
of
the
heavens
around
it
ran
a
mighty
rampart
feet
high
and
twenty
feet
in
thickness
at
the
base
its
angles
pointed
north
south
east
and
west
with
gates
and
turrets
and
within
this
wall
were
fruitful
orchards
apple
and
cherry
and
pear
and
sheltered
in
their
midst
from
all
but
sun
a
garden
warm
and
busy
with
singing
bees
there
many
an
hour
his
christine
sang
to
her
child
her
magdalen
or
watched
her
playing
a
flower
among
the
flowers
dark
in
the
centre
of
that
zone
of
bliss
arose
the
magic
towers
of
tycho
brahe
two
of
them
had
great
windows
in
their
roofs
opening
upon
the
sky
he
willed
and
under
these
observatories
he
made
a
library
of
many
a
golden
book
poets
and
sages
of
old
greece
and
rome
and
many
a
mellow
legend
many
a
dream
of
dawning
truth
in
egypt
or
the
dusk
of
araby
under
all
of
these
he
made
a
subterranean
crypt
for
alchemy
with
sixteen
furnaces
and
under
this
he
sank
a
well
so
deep
that
jeppe
declared
he
had
tapped
the
central
fountains
of
the
world
and
drew
his
magic
from
those
cold
clear
springs
this
was
the
very
well
said
jeppe
the
dwarf
where
truth
was
hidden
but
by
tycho
brahe
and
his
weird
skill
the
magic
water
flowed
through
pipes
uphill
to
all
the
house
above
the
kitchen
where
his
cooks
could
broil
a
trout
for
sages
or
prepare
a
feast
for
kings
the
garrets
for
the
students
in
the
roof
the
and
the
red
room
to
the
north
the
study
and
the
blue
room
to
the
south
the
small
octagonal
yellow
room
that
held
the
sunlight
like
a
jewel
all
day
long
and
magdalen
with
her
happy
dreams
at
night
then
facing
to
the
west
one
long
green
room
the
ceiling
painted
like
the
bower
of
eve
with
flowers
and
leaves
the
windows
opening
wide
through
which
christine
and
tycho
brahe
at
dawn
could
see
the
white
sails
drifting
on
the
sound
like
petals
from
their
orchard
to
the
north
he
built
a
printing
house
for
noble
books
poems
and
those
deep
legends
of
the
sky
still
to
be
born
at
his
uraniborg
beyond
the
rampart
to
the
north
arose
a
workshop
for
his
instruments
to
the
south
a
low
thatched
rambled
round
a
yard
alive
with
clucking
hens
and
further
yet
to
southward
on
another
hill
he
made
a
great
house
for
his
larger
instruments
and
called
it
stiernborg
mountain
of
the
stars
and
on
his
towers
and
turrets
tycho
set
statues
with
golden
verses
in
the
praise
of
famous
men
the
bearers
of
the
torch
from
ptolemy
to
the
new
copernicus
then
in
that
mountain
of
the
stars
he
set
in
all
their
splendour
of
brass
his
armouries
for
the
assault
of
heaven
circles
in
azimuth
armillary
spheres
revolving
zodiacs
with
great
brazen
rings
quadrants
of
solid
brass
ten
cubits
broad
brass
parallactic
rules
made
to
revolve
in
azimuth
clocks
with
wheels
an
astrolabe
and
that
large
globe
strengthened
by
oaken
beams
he
made
at
augsburg
all
his
gold
he
spent
but
denmark
had
a
prince
in
those
great
days
and
in
his
brain
the
dreams
of
tycho
brahe
kindled
a
thirst
for
glory
so
he
made
tycho
the
lord
of
sundry
lands
and
rents
and
keeper
of
the
chapel
where
the
kings
of
oldenburg
were
buried
for
he
said
to
whom
could
all
these
kings
entrust
their
bones
more
fitly
than
to
him
who
read
the
stars
and
though
a
mortal
knew
immortal
laws
and
paced
at
night
the
silent
halls
of
heaven
vi
he
was
a
great
magician
tycho
brahe
there
on
his
island
for
a
score
of
years
he
watched
the
skies
recording
star
on
star
for
future
ages
and
by
patient
toil
perfected
his
great
tables
of
the
sun
the
moon
the
planets
there
too
happy
far
for
any
history
sons
and
daughters
rose
a
little
clan
of
love
around
christine
and
tycho
thought
when
i
am
dead
my
sons
will
rule
and
work
in
my
uraniborg
and
yet
a
doubt
would
trouble
him
for
he
knew
the
children
of
christine
would
still
be
held
ignoble
by
the
world
disciples
came
and
swift
the
bearers
of
the
torch
from
many
a
city
to
uraniborg
and
tycho
brahe
received
them
like
a
king
and
bade
them
light
their
torches
at
his
fire
the
king
of
scotland
came
with
all
his
court
and
dwelt
eight
days
in
tycho
brahe
domain
asking
him
many
a
riddle
deep
and
dark
whose
answer
none
the
less
a
king
should
know
what
boots
it
on
this
earth
to
be
a
king
to
rule
a
part
of
earth
and
not
to
know
the
worth
of
his
own
realm
whether
he
rule
as
god
and
his
realm
be
still
the
centre
of
the
centre
of
all
worlds
or
whether
as
copernicus
proclaimed
this
earth
itself
be
moving
a
lost
grain
of
dust
among
the
innumerable
stars
for
this
would
dwarf
all
glory
but
the
soul
in
king
or
peasant
that
can
hail
the
truth
though
truth
should
slay
it
so
to
tycho
brahe
the
king
became
a
subject
for
eight
days
but
in
the
crowded
hall
when
he
had
gone
jeppe
raised
his
matted
head
with
a
chuckle
of
glee
quiet
as
the
gurgle
of
joy
in
a
dark
when
the
first
ripple
and
wash
of
the
first
flows
bubbling
under
the
dry
fringe
of
seaweed
setting
it
all
afloat
again
in
magical
colours
like
a
merman
hair
jeppe
has
a
thought
the
gay
young
students
cried
thronging
him
round
for
all
believed
that
jeppe
was
fey
and
had
strange
visions
of
the
truth
what
is
the
thought
jeppe
i
can
think
no
thoughts
croaked
jeppe
but
i
have
made
myself
a
song
silence
they
cried
for
jeppe
the
nightingale
sing
jeppe
and
wagging
his
great
head
to
and
fro
before
the
fire
with
deep
dark
eyes
he
crooned
the
song
of
jeppe
what
said
the
king
is
earth
a
bird
or
bee
can
this
uncharted
boundless
realm
of
ours
drone
thro
the
sky
with
leagues
of
struggling
sea
forests
and
hills
and
towns
and
ay
said
the
dwarf
i
have
watched
from
stiernborg
crown
her
far
dark
rim
uplift
against
the
sky
but
while
earth
soars
men
say
the
stars
go
down
and
while
earth
sails
men
say
the
stars
go
by
an
elvish
tale
ask
jeppe
the
dwarf
knows
that
why
his
eyes
look
fey
for
chuckling
deep
heels
over
head
amongst
the
stars
he
goes
as
all
men
go
but
most
are
sound
asleep
king
saint
sage
even
those
that
count
it
true
act
as
this
miracle
touched
them
not
at
all
they
are
borne
undizzied
thro
the
rushing
blue
and
build
their
empires
on
a
ball
then
said
the
king
if
earth
so
lightly
move
what
of
my
realm
o
what
shall
now
stand
sure
naught
said
the
dwarf
in
all
this
world
but
love
all
else
is
and
shall
not
endure
is
nearer
now
our
universe
hath
no
centre
our
shadowy
earth
and
fleeting
heavens
no
stay
but
that
deep
inward
realm
which
each
can
enter
even
jeppe
the
dwarf
by
his
own
secret
way
where
said
the
king
o
where
i
have
not
found
it
here
said
the
dwarf
and
music
echoed
here
this
infinite
circle
hath
no
line
to
bound
it
therefore
that
deep
strange
centre
is
everywhere
let
the
earth
soar
thro
heaven
that
centre
abideth
or
plunge
to
the
pit
his
covenant
still
holds
true
in
the
heart
of
a
dying
bird
the
master
hideth
in
the
soul
of
a
king
said
the
dwarf
and
in
soul
too
vii
princes
and
courtiers
came
a
few
to
seek
a
little
knowledge
many
more
to
gape
in
wonder
at
tycho
gold
and
silver
mask
or
when
they
saw
the
beauty
of
his
towers
envy
and
hate
him
for
them
thus
arose
the
small
grey
cloud
upon
the
distant
sky
that
broke
in
storm
at
last
beware
croaked
jeppe
lifting
his
shaggy
head
beside
the
fire
when
guests
like
these
had
gone
master
beware
and
tycho
of
the
frank
blue
eyes
would
laugh
even
when
he
found
witichius
playing
him
false
his
anger
like
a
momentary
breeze
died
on
the
dreaming
deep
for
tycho
brahe
turned
to
a
nobler
riddle
have
you
thought
he
asked
his
young
disciples
how
the
sea
is
moved
to
that
strange
rhythm
we
call
the
tides
he
that
can
answer
this
shall
have
his
name
honoured
among
the
bearers
of
the
torch
while
pegasus
flies
above
uraniborg
i
was
delayed
three
hours
or
more
by
the
the
fishermen
on
the
coast
are
never
wrong
they
time
it
by
the
moon
perhaps
not
and
yet
through
all
the
changes
of
the
sky
and
sea
that
old
white
clock
of
ours
with
the
battered
face
does
seem
infallible
there
a
too
the
sailors
on
the
coast
of
sweden
sing
i
have
often
pondered
it
your
courtly
poets
upbraid
the
inconstant
moon
but
these
men
know
the
moon
and
sea
are
lovers
and
they
move
in
a
most
constant
measure
hear
the
words
and
tell
me
if
you
can
what
silver
chains
bind
them
together
then
in
a
voice
as
low
and
rhythmical
as
the
sea
he
spoke
that
song
the
shepherdess
of
the
sea
reproach
not
yet
our
sails
delay
you
can
not
see
the
shoaling
bay
the
banks
of
sand
the
fretful
bars
that
ebb
left
naked
to
the
stars
the
sea
white
shepherdess
the
moon
shall
lead
us
into
harbour
soon
dear
when
you
see
her
glory
shine
between
your
fragrant
boughs
of
pine
know
there
is
but
one
hour
to
wait
before
her
hands
unlock
the
gate
and
the
full
flood
of
singing
foam
follow
her
lovely
footsteps
home
then
waves
like
flocks
of
silver
sheep
come
rustling
inland
from
the
deep
and
into
rambling
valleys
press
behind
their
heavenly
shepherdess
you
can
not

them
lift
your
eyes
and
see
their
mistress
in
the
skies
she
rises
with
her
silver
bow
i

flow
and
every

viii
he
was
a
great
magician
tycho
brahe
but
not
so
great
that
he
could
read
the
heart
or
rule
the
hand
of
princes
when
his
friend
king
frederick
died
the
young
prince
christian
reigned
and
round
him
fool
and
knave
made
common
cause
against
the
magic
that
could
pour
their
gold
into
a
gulf
of
stars
this
tycho
brahe
had
grown
too
proud
he
held
them
in
contempt
so
they
believed
for
when
he
spoke
their
thoughts
crept
at
his
feet
like
spaniels
junkerdom
felt
it
was
foolish
for
he
towered
above
it
and
so
it
hated
him
did
he
not
spend
gold
that
a
fool
could
spend
as
quickly
as
he
were
there
not
great
estates
bestowed
upon
him
in
wisdom
name
that
from
the
dawn
of
time
had
been
the
natural
right
of
junkerdom
and
would
he
not
bequeath
them
to
his
heirs
the
children
of
christine
an
unfree
woman
why
you
sire
even
you
they
told
the
king
he
has
made
a
that
horoscope
he
read
for
you
the
night
when
you
were
born
printed
and
bound
it
in
green
velvet
too
read
it
the
whole
world
laughs
at
it
he
said
that
venus
was
the
star
that
ruled
your
fate
and
venus
would
destroy
you
tycho
brahe
inspired
your
royal
father
with
the
fear
that
kept
your
youth
so
long
in
the
fear
that
every
pretty
hedgerow
flower
would
be
your
circe
so
he
thought
to
avenge
our
mockery
of
this
christine
to
whom
indeed
he
plays
the
faithful
swine
knowing
full
well
his
gold
and
silver
nose
would
never
win
another
thus
the
sky
darkened
above
uraniborg
and
those
who
dwelt
within
it
till
one
evil
day
one
seeming
happy
day
when
tycho
marked
the
star
upon
his
chart
two
pompous
officers
from
walchendorp
the
chancellor
knocked
at
tycho
eastern
gate
we
are
sent
they
said
to
see
and
to
report
what
use
you
make
of
these
estates
of
yours
your
alchemy
has
turned
more
gold
to
lead
than
denmark
can
approve
the
uses
now
show
us
the
uses
of
this
work
of
yours
then
tycho
showed
his
tables
of
the
stars
seven
hundred
stars
each
noted
in
its
place
with
exquisite
precision
the
result
of
watching
heaven
for
years
and
is
this
all
they
said
they
sought
to
invent
some
ground
for
damning
him
the
truth
alone
would
serve
them
as
it
seemed
for
these
were
men
who
could
not
understand
not
all
i
hope
said
tycho
for
i
think
before
i
die
i
shall
have
marked
a
thousand
to
what
end
when
shall
we
reap
the
fruits
of
all
this
toil
show
us
its
uses
in
the
time
to
come
said
tycho
brahe
perhaps
a
hundred
years
perhaps
a
thousand
when
our
own
poor
names
are
quite
forgotten
and
our
kingdoms
dust
on
one
sure
certain
day
the
will
at
some
point
of
contact
see
a
light
moving
upon
this
chaos
though
our
eyes
be
shut
for
ever
in
an
iron
sleep
their
eyes
shall
see
the
kingdom
of
the
law
our
undiscovered
cosmos
they
shall
see
it
a
new
creation
rising
from
the
deep
beautiful
whole
we
are
like
men
that
hear
disjointed
notes
of
some
supernal
choir
year
after
year
we
patiently
record
all
we
can
gather
in
that
time
a
people
that
we
have
not
known
shall
hear
them
moving
like
music
to
a
single
end
they
could
not
understand
this
life
that
sought
only
to
bear
the
torch
and
hand
it
on
and
so
they
made
report
that
all
the
dreams
of
tycho
brahe
were
fruitless
perilous
too
since
he
avowed
that
any
fruit
they
bore
would
fall
in
distant
years
to
alien
hands
little
by
little
walchendorp
withdrew
his
rents
from
tycho
brahe
accusing
him
of
gross
neglects
the
chapel
at
roskilde
was
falling
into
ruin
tycho
brahe
was
keeper
of
the
bones
of
oldenburg
he
must
rebuild
the
chapel
all
the
gifts
that
frederick
gave
to
help
him
in
his
task
were
turned
to
till
one
dark
day
he
called
his
young
disciples
round
him
there
and
in
that
mellow
library
of
dreams
lit
by
the
dying
sunset
poured
his
heart
and
mind
before
them
bidding
them
farewell
through
the
windows
as
he
spoke
they
heard
the
sorrowful
whisper
of
the
sea
ebbing
and
flowing
around
uraniborg
an
end
has
come
he
said
to
all
we
planned
uraniborg
has
drained
her
treasury
dry
your
alma
mater
now
must
close
her
gates
on
you
her
guests
on
me
and
worst
of
all
on
one
most
dear
who
made
this
place
my
home
for
you
are
young
your
homes
are
all
to
win
and
you
would
all
have
gone
your
separate
ways
in
a
brief
while
and
though
i
think
you
love
your
college
of
the
skies
it
could
not
mean
all
that
it
meant
to
those
who
called
it
you
that
have
worked
with
me
for
one
brief
year
will
never
quite
forget
uraniborg
this
room
the
sunset
gilding
all
those
books
the
and
that
old
celestial
globe
the
long
bright
evenings
by
the
winter
fire
of
tycho
brahe
were
fruitless
perilous
the
talk
that
opened
heaven
the
songs
you
sung
yes
even
i
think
the
tricks
you
played
with
jeppe
will
somehow
when
yourselves
are
growing
old
be
hallowed
into
beauty
touched
with
tears
for
you
will
wish
they
might
be
yours
again
these
have
been
mine
for
years
and
more
than
these
the
work
the
dreams
i
shared
with
you
and
others
here
my
heart
will
break
to
leave
them
but
the
appointed
time
has
come
as
it
must
come
to
all
men
you
and
i
have
watched
too
many
constant
stars
to
dream
that
heaven
or
earth
the
destinies
of
men
or
nations
are
the
sport
of
chance
an
end
comes
to
us
all
through
blindness
age
or
death
if
mine
must
come
in
exile
it
stall
find
me
bearing
the
torch
as
far
as
i
can
bear
it
until
i
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
young
runner
who
takes
it
from
me
and
carries
it
out
of
sight
into
the
great
new
age
i
shall
not
know
into
the
great
new
realms
i
must
not
tread
come
then
let
me
see
you
stand
waiting
before
me
crowned
with
youth
and
joy
at
the
next
turning
take
it
from
my
hand
for
i
am
almost
ready
now
to
fall
something
i
have
achieved
yes
though
i
say
it
i
have
not
loitered
on
that
fiery
way
and
if
i
front
the
judgment
of
the
wise
in
centuries
to
come
with
more
of
dread
than
my
destroyers
it
is
because
this
work
will
be
of
use
remembered
and
appraised
when
all
their
hate
is
dead
i
say
the
work
not
the
blind
rumour
the
glory
or
fame
of
it
these
observations
of
seven
hundred
stars
are
little
enough
in
sight
of
those
great
hosts
which
nightly
wheel
around
us
though
i
hope
yes
i
still
hope
in
some
more
generous
land
to
make
my
thousand
up
before
i
die
little
enough
i
know
a
midget
work
the
men
that
follow
me
with
more
delicate
art
may
add
their
tens
of
thousands
yet
my
sum
will
save
them
just
that
years
of
patience
bring
them
sooner
to
their
goal
that
kingdom
of
the
law
i
shall
not
see
we
are
on
the
verge
of
great
discoveries
i
feel
them
as
a
dreamer
feels
the
dawn
before
his
eyes
are
opened
many
of
you
will
see
them
in
that
day
you
will
recall
this
our
last
meeting
at
uraniborg
and
how
i
told
you
that
this
work
of
ours
would
lead
to
victories
for
the
coming
age
the
victors
may
forget
us
what
of
that
theirs
be
the
palms
the
shouting
and
the
praise
ours
be
the
fathers
glory
in
the
sons
ours
the
delight
of
giving
the
deep
joy
of
labouring
on
the
cliff
face
all
night
long
cutting
them
in
the
solid
rock
whereby
they
climb
so
gaily
to
the
heights
and
gaze
upon
their
worlds
you
will
not
find
me
there
when
you
descend
look
for
me
in
the
darkness
at
the
foot
of
those
high
cliffs
under
the
drifted
leaves
that
where
we
hide
at
last
we
pioneers
for
we
are
very
proud
and
must
be
sought
before
the
world
can
find
us
in
our
graves
there
have
been
compensations
i
have
seen
in
darkness
more
perhaps
than
eyes
can
see
when
sunlight
blinds
them
on
the
guessed
at
a
glory
past
our
mortal
range
and
only
mine
because
the
night
was
mine
of
those
three
systems
of
the
universe
the
ptolemaic
held
by
all
the
schools
may
yet
be
proven
false
we
yet
may
find
this
earth
of
ours
is
not
the
sovran
lord
of
all
those
wheeling
spheres
ourselves
have
marked
movements
among
the
planets
that
forbid
acceptance
of
it
wholly
some
of
these
are
moving
round
the
sun
if
we
can
trust
our
years
of
watching
there
are
stranger
dreams
this
radical
copernicus
the
priest
of
whom
i
often
talked
with
you
declares
ail
of
these
movements
can
be
reconciled
if
a
hypothesis
only
we
should
take
the
sun
itself
for
centre
and
assume
that
this
huge
earth
so
so
secure
in
its
foundations
is
a
planet
also
and
moves
around
the
sun
i
can
not
think
it
this
leap
of
thought
is
yet
too
great
for
me
i
have
no
doubt
that
ptolemy
was
wrong
some
of
his
planets
move
around
the
sun
copernicus
is
nearer
to
the
truth
in
some
things
but
the
planets
we
have
watched
still
wander
from
the
course
that
he
assigned
therefore
my
system
which
includes
the
best
of
both
i
hold
may
yet
be
proven
true
this
earth
of
ours
as
jeppe
declared
one
day
so
simply
that
we
laughed
is
too
big
to
move
so
let
it
be
the
centre
still
and
let
the
planets
move
around
their
sun
but
let
the
sun
with
all
its
planets
move
around
our
central
earth
this
at
the
least
accords
with
all
we
know
and
saves
mankind
from
that
enormous
plunge
into
the
night
saves
them
from
voyaging
for
ten
thousand
years
through
boundless
darkness
without
sight
of
land
saves
them
from
all
that
agony
of
loss
as
one
by
one
the
of
faith
are
drowned
in
blackness
i
beseech
you
then
let
me
be
proven
wrong
before
you
take
that
darkness
lightly
if
at
last
you
find
the
proven
facts
against
me
take
the
plunge
launch
out
into
that
darkness
let
the
lamps
of
heaven
the
glowing
that
we
knew
die
out
behind
you
while
the
freshening
wind
blows
on
your
brows
and
overhead
you
see
the
stars
of
truth
that
lead
you
from
your
home
i
love
this
island
every
little
glen
brook
and
every
bough
and
blossom
in
that
garden
and
i
hoped
to
die
here
but
it
is
not
chance
i
know
that
sends
me
wandering
through
the
world
again
my
use
perhaps
is
ended
and
the
power
that
made
me
breaks
me
as
he
spoke
they
saw
the
tears
upon
his
face
he
bowed
his
head
and
left
them
silent
in
the
darkened
room
they
saw
his
face
no
more
the
hour
tycho
christine
and
all
their
children
left
their
for
even
in
their
ship
they
took
a
few
of
the
smaller
instruments
and
that
most
precious
record
of
the
stars
his
legacy
to
the
future
into
the
night
they
vanished
leaving
on
the
ghostly
cliffs
only
one
dark
distorted
shape
to
watch
them
sobbing
under
its
matted
hair
master
have
you
forgotten
jeppe
your
dwarf
ix
he
was
a
great
magician
tycho
brahe
and
yet
his
magic
under
changing
skies
could
never
change
his
heart
or
touch
the
hills
of
those
far
countries
with
the
tints
of
home
and
after
many
a
month
of
wandering
he
came
to
prague
and
though
with
open
hands
rodolphe
received
him
like
an
exiled
king
a
new
aeneas
exiled
for
the
truth
for
so
they
called
him
none
could
heal
the
wounds
that
bled
within
or
lull
his
grief
to
sleep
with
that
familiar
whisper
of
the
waves
ebbing
and
flowing
around
uraniborg
doggedly
still
he
laboured
point
by
point
crept
on
with
aching
heart
and
burning
brain
until
his
table
of
the
stars
had
reached
the
thousand
that
he
hoped
to
crown
his
toil
but
christine
heard
him
murmuring
in
the
night
the
work
the
work
not
to
have
lived
in
vain
into
whose
hands
can
i
entrust
it
all
i
thought
to
find
him
standing
by
the
way
waiting
to
seize
the
splendour
from
my
hand
the
swift
runner
with
the
torch
let
me
not
live
in
vain
let
me
not
fall
before
i
yield
it
to
the
appointed
soul
and
yet
the
power
that
made
and
broke
him
heard
for
on
a
certain
day
to
tycho
came
another
exile
guided
through
the
dark
of
europe
by
the
starlight
in
his
eyes
or
that
invisible
hand
which
guides
the
world
he
asked
him
as
the
runner
with
the
torch
alone
could
ask
asked
as
a
natural
right
for
tycho
those
results
his
tables
of
the
stars
he
gave
his
name
almost
as
one
who
told
him
is
i
and
yet
unconscious
that
he
told
a
name
not
famous
yet
though
truth
had
marked
him
out
already
by
his
exile
as
her
own
the
name
of
johann
kepler
it
was
strange
wrote
kepler
not
long
after
for
i
asked
things
and
yet
he
gave
them
to
me
as
if
i
were
his
son
when
first
i
saw
him
we
seemed
to
have
known
each
other
years
ago
in
some
forgotten
world
i
could
not
guess
that
tycho
brahe
was
dying
he
was
quick
of
temper
and
we
quarrelled
now
and
then
only
to
find
ourselves
more
closely
bound
than
ever
i
believe
that
tycho
died
simply
of
heartache
for
his
native
land
for
though
he
always
met
me
with
a
smile
or
jest
upon
his
lips
he
could
not
sleep
or
work
and
often
unawares
i
caught
odd
little
whispered
phrases
on
his
lips
as
if
he
talked
to
himself
in
a
kind
of
dream
yet
i
believe
the
clouds
dispersed
a
little
around
his
and
with
that
strange
joy
which
comes
in
death
he
saw
the
unchanging
stars
christine
was
there
she
held
him
in
her
arms
i
think
too
that
he
knew
his
work
was
safe
an
hour
before
he
died
he
smiled
at
me
and
whispered
what
he
meant
i
hardly
know
perhaps
a
broken
echo
from
the
past
a
fragment
of
some
old
familiar
thought
and
yet
i
seemed
to
know
it
haunts
me
still
then
let
me
see
you
stand
waiting
before
me
crowned
with
youth
and
joy
this
is
the
turning
take
it
from
my
hand
for
i
am
ready
ready
now
to
fall
iii
kepler
john
kepler
from
the
chimney
corner
watched
his
wife
susannah
with
her
sleeves
rolled
back
making
a
salad
in
a
big
blue
bowl
the
thick
tufts
of
his
black
rebellious
hair
brushed
into
sleek
submission
his
trim
beard
snug
as
the
soft
round
body
of
a
thrush
between
the
white
wings
of
his
ruff
his
best
with
the
fine
lace
border
spoke
of
guests
expected
and
his
quick
grey
humorous
eyes
his
firm
red
whimsical
mouth
and
all
those
elvish
twinklings
of
his
face
were
lit
with
eagerness
only
between
his
brows
perplexed
beneath
that
subtle
load
of
dreams
two
delicate
shadows
brooded
what
does
it
mean
sir
henry
wotton
letter
breathed
a
hint
that
italy
is
prohibiting
my
book
he
muttered
then
if
austria
damns
it
too
susannah
mine
we
may
be
forced
to
choose
between
the
truth
and
exile
when
he
comes
he
tell
me
more
ambassadors
i
suppose
can
only
write
in
cipher
while
our
world
is
steered
to
heaven
by
murderers
and
thieves
but
if
he
wrapped
his
friendly
warnings
up
in
a
verse
or
two
i
might
have
done
more
work
these
last
three
days
eh
sue
look
john
said
she
what
beautiful
hearts
of
lettuce
tell
me
now
how
shall
i
mix
it
will
your
english
guest
turn
up
his
nose
at
dandelion
leaves
as
crisp
and
young
as
these
they
just
the
tang
of
bitterness
in
their
milk
that
gives
a
relish
and
makes
all
sweet
and
that
philosophy
john
now
these
spring
onions
would
his
excellency
like
sugared
better
he
a
poet
not
an
ambassador
only
so
i
think
he
like
a
cottage
salad
a
poet
john
i
hate
their
arrogant
little
insect
ways
i
put
a
toadstool
in
poets
dear
heart
can
be
divided
into
two
clear
kinds
one
that
by
virtue
of
a
brain
lives
in
a
silly
world
of
his
own
making
a
bubble
blown
by
himself
in
which
he
flits
and
dizzily
bombinates
chanting
i
i
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
heavens
above
or
the
earth
or
hell
beneath
but
goes
to
swell
his
personal
pronoun
bring
him
some
dreadful
news
his
dearest
friend
is
burned
to
death
you
see
the
monstrous
insect
strike
an
attitude
and
shape
himself
into
one
capital
i
a
rubric
with
red
eyes
you
see
him
use
the
coffin
for
his
pedestal
hear
him
mouth
his
i
i
instructing
haggard
grief
concerning
his
odd
ego
does
he
chirp
of
love
it
i
i
narcissus
love
myself
narcissus
imaged
in
those
eyes
for
all
the
that
he
sounds
are
made
after
the
fashion
of
passionate
grasshoppers
by
grating
one
across
another
nor
does
he
learn
to
sound
that
mellower
until
his
bubble
bursts
and
leaves
him
drowned
an
insect
in
a
but
there
another
kind
whose
mind
still
moves
in
vital
concord
with
the
soul
of
things
so
that
it
thinks
in
music
and
its
thoughts
pulse
into
natural
song
a
separate
voice
and
yet
caught
up
by
the
surrounding
choirs
there
in
the
harmonies
of
the
universe
losing
himself
he
saves
his
soul
alive
john
i
afraid
afraid
of
what
susannah
afraid
to
put
those
ducklings
on
to
roast
your
friend
may
miss
his
road
and
if
he
late
my
little
part
of
the
music
will
be
spoiled
he
wo
susannah
bad
poets
are
always
late
good
poets
at
times
delay
a
note
or
two
but
all
the
great
are
punctual
as
the
sun
what
that
he
early
that
his
knock
i
think
the
lord
have
mercy
john
there
nothing
ready
take
him
into
your
study
and
talk
to
him
talk
hard
he
come
an
hour
before
his
time
and
i
to
change
my
dress
i
into
the
kitchen
then
in
a
moment
all
the
cottage
rang
with
greetings
hand
grasped
hand
his
excellency
forgot
the
careful
prologue
he
prepared
and
made
an
end
of
mystery
he
had
brought
a
message
from
his
king
who
hearing
of
new
menaces
to
the
light
in
europe
urged
the
illustrious
kepler
now
to
make
his
home
in
england
there
his
thought
and
speech
would
both
be
free
my
friend
said
wotton
i
have
moved
in
those
old
strongholds
of
the
night
and
heard
strange
mutterings
it
is
not
many
years
since
bruno
burned
there
trouble
brewing
too
for
one
you
know
i
think
the
florentine
who
made
that
curious
optic
tube
you
mean
the
man
at
padua
galileo
yes
they
will
not
dare
or
need
proof
or
disproof
rests
with
their
eyes
kepler
have
you
not
heard
of
those
who
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
had
eyes
and
would
not
see
eyes
quickly
close
when
souls
prefer
the
dark
so
be
it
other
and
younger
eyes
will
see
perhaps
that
why
god
gave
the
young
a
spice
of
devilry
they
go
look
while
elders
gasp
and
when
the
devil
and
truth
go
hand
in
hand
god
help
their
enemies
you
will
send
my
thanks
my
grateful
thanks
sir
henry
to
your
king
i
can
not
answer
you
i
must
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
my
wife
would
find
it
hard
to
leave
her
native
land
say
nothing
yet
before
her
then
to
hide
their
secret
from
susannah
kepler
poured
his
mind
out
and
the
world
dead
branches
bloomed
for
when
he
talked
another
spring
began
to
which
our
may
was
winter
and
in
the
boughs
of
his
delicious
thoughts
like
feathered
choirs
bits
of
old
rhyme
scraps
from
the
sabine
farm
celestial
phrases
from
the
shepherd
king
and
fluttering
morsels
from
catullus
sang
much
was
fantastic
all
was
touched
with
light
that
only
genius
knows
to
steal
from
heaven
he
spoke
of
poetry
as
the
flowering
time
of
knowledge
called
it
thought
in
passionate
tune
with
those
great
rhythms
that
steer
the
moon
and
sun
thought
in
such
concord
with
the
soul
of
things
that
it
can
only
move
like
tides
and
stars
and
man
own
beating
heart
and
the
wings
of
birds
in
law
whose
service
only
sets
them
free
therefore
it
often
leaps
to
the
truth
we
seek
clasping
it
as
a
lover
clasps
his
bride
in
darkness
ere
the
sage
can
light
his
lamp
and
so
in
music
men
might
find
the
road
to
truth
at
many
a
point
where
sages
grope
one
day
a
greater
plato
would
arise
to
write
a
new
philosophy
he
said
showing
how
music
is
the
golden
clue
to
all
the
windings
of
the
world
dark
maze
himself
had
used
it
partly
proved
it
too
in
his
own
book
harmonies
of
the
that
the
years
discover
points
one
way
to
this
great
ordered
harmony
he
said
revealed
on
earth
by
music
planets
move
in
subtle
accord
like
notes
of
one
great
song
audible
only
to
the
artificer
the
eternal
artist
there
no
grief
no
pain
but
music
follow
it
simply
as
a
clue
a
microcosmic
pattern
of
the
whole
can
show
you
somewhere
in
its
golden
scheme
the
use
of
all
such
discords
and
at
last
their
exquisite
solution
then
darkness
breaks
into
diviner
light
love
agony
climbs
through
death
to
life
and
evil
builds
up
heaven
have
you
not
heard
in
some
great
symphony
those
golden
mathematics
making
clear
the
victory
of
the
soul
have
you
not
heard
the
very
heavens
opening
do
those
fools
who
thought
me
an
infidel
then
still
smile
at
me
for
trying
to
read
the
stars
in
terms
of
song
discern
their
orbits
measure
their
distances
by
musical
proportions
let
them
smile
my
folly
at
least
revealed
those
three
great
laws
gave
me
the
golden
vases
of
the
egyptians
to
set
in
the
great
new
temple
of
my
god
beyond
the
bounds
of
egypt
they
will
forget
my
methods
doubtless
as
the
years
go
by
and
the
world
wisdom
shuts
its
music
out
the
dust
will
gather
on
all
my
harmonies
or
scholars
turn
my
pages
listlessly
glance
at
the
musical
phrases
and
pass
on
not
troubling
even
to
read
one
latin
page
yet
they
accept
those
great
results
as
mine
i
call
them
mine
how
can
i
help
exulting
who
climbed
my
ladder
of
music
to
the
skies
and
found
by
accident
let
them
call
it
so
or
by
the
inspiration
of
that
power
which
built
his
world
of
music
those
three
laws
first
how
the
speed
of
planets
round
the
sun
bears
a
proportion
beautifully
precise
as
music
to
their
silver
distances
next
that
although
they
seem
to
swerve
aside
from
those
plain
circles
of
old
copernicus
their
paths
were
not
less
rhythmical
and
exact
but
followed
always
that
most
exquisite
curve
in
its
most
perfect
form
the
pure
ellipse
third
that
although
their
speed
from
point
to
point
appeared
to
change
their
radii
always
moved
through
equal
fields
of
space
in
equal
times
was
this
my
infidelity
was
this
less
full
of
beauty
less
divine
in
truth
than
their
dull
chaos
you
the
poet
will
know
how
as
those
dark
perplexities
grew
clear
and
old
anomalous
discords
changed
to
song
my
whole
soul
bowed
and
cried
god
these
are
thy
thoughts
i
am
thinking
after
thee
i
hope
that
tycho
knows
i
owed
so
much
to
tycho
brahe
for
it
was
he
who
built
the
towers
from
which
i
hailed
those
three
great
laws
how
strange
and
far
away
it
all
seems
now
the
thistles
grow
upon
that
little
isle
where
tycho
great
uraniborg
once
was
yet
for
a
few
sad
years
before
it
fell
into
decay
and
ruin
there
was
one
who
crept
about
its
crumbling
corridors
and
lit
the
fire
of
memory
on
its
hearth
wotton
looked
quickly
up
i
think
i
have
heard
something
of
that
you
mean
poor
jeppe
his
dwarf
fynes
moryson
at
the
mermaid
inn
one
night
showed
a
most
curious
manuscript
a
scrawl
on
yellow
parchment
crusted
here
and
there
with
or
the
salt
of
those
thick
tears
creatures
like
jeppe
the
crooked
dwarf
could
weep
it
had
been
found
clasped
in
a
crooked
hand
under
the
cliffs
of
wheen
a
crooked
hand
that
many
a
time
had
beckoned
to
passing
ships
hoping
to
find
some
voyager
who
would
take
a
letter
to
its
master
the
sailors
laughed
and
jeered
at
him
till
jeppe
threw
stones
at
them
and
now
jeppe
too
was
dead
and
one
who
knew
fynes
moryson
had
found
him
and
brought
home
that
curious
crooked
scrawl
fynes
englished
it
out
of
its
barbarous
danish
thus
it
ran
have
you
forgotten
jeppe
your
dwarf
who
used
to
lie
beside
the
big
and
feed
from
your
own
hand
the
hall
is
dark
there
are
no
voices
now
only
the
wind
and
the
crying
round
uraniborg
i
too
am
crying
master
even
i
because
there
is
no
fire
upon
the
hearth
no
light
in
any
window
it
is
night
and
all
the
faces
that
i
knew
are
gone
master
i
watched
you
leaving
us
i
saw
the
white
sails
dwindling
into
wings
then
melting
into
foam
and
all
was
dark
i
lay
among
the
wild
flowers
on
the
cliff
and
dug
my
nails
into
the
stiff
white
chalk
and
called
you
tycho
brahe
you
did
not
hear
but
gulls
and
jackdaws
wheeling
round
my
head
mocked
me
with
and
you
were
a
great
magician
tycho
brahe
and
now
that
they
have
driven
you
away
i
that
am
only
jeppe
the
crooked
dwarf
you
used
to
laugh
at
for
his
matted
hair
and
head
too
big
and
heavy
take
your
pen
here
in
your
study
i
will
write
it
down
and
send
it
by
a
sailor
to
the
king
of
scotland
and
who
knows
the
mouse
that
gnawed
the
lion
free
may
save
you
tycho
brahe
he
is
free
now
said
kepler
had
he
lived
he
would
have
sent
for
jeppe
to
join
him
there
at
prague
but
death
forestalled
him
and
your
king
the
years
in
which
he
watched
that
planet
mars
his
patient
notes
and
records
all
were
mine
and
mark
you
had
he
clipped
or
trimmed
one
fact
by
even
a
so
that
his
results
made
a
pure
circle
of
that
planet
path
it
might
have
baffled
us
for
an
age
and
drowned
all
our
new
light
in
darkness
but
he
held
to
what
he
saw
he
might
so
easily
so
comfortably
have
said
instruments
are
crude
and
fallible
in
so
fine
a
point
eyes
may
have
erred
too
why
not
acquiesce
why
mar
the
tune
why
dislocate
a
world
for
one
slight
clash
of
seeming
fact
with
faith
but
no
though
stars
might
swerve
he
held
his
course
recording
only
what
his
eyes
could
see
until
death
closed
them
then
to
his
results
i
added
mine
and
saw
in
one
wild
gleam
strange
as
the
light
of
day
to
one
born
blind
a
subtler
concord
ruling
them
and
heard
profounder
tones
of
harmony
resolve
those
broken
melodies
into
song
again
faintly
and
far
away
i
too
have
seen
in
music
and
in
verse
that
golden
clue
whereof
you
speak
said
wotton
in
all
true
song
there
is
a
hidden
logic
even
the
rhyme
that
in
bad
poets
wrings
the
neck
of
thought
is
like
a
subtle
calculus
to
the
true
an
instrument
of
discovery
it
reveals
new
harmonies
new
analogies
it
links
far
things
and
near
not
in
unnatural
chains
but
in
those
true
accords
which
still
escape
the
plodding
reason
yet
unify
the
world
i
caught
some
glimpses
of
this
mystic
power
in
verses
of
your
own
that
elegy
on
tycho
and
that
great
quatrain
of
yours
i
can
not
quite
recall
the
latin
words
but
made
it
roughly
mine
in
words
like
these
know
that
i
am
dust
and
daily
die
yet
as
i
trace
those
rhythmic
spheres
at
night
i
stand
before
the
thunderer
throne
on
high
and
feast
on
nectar
in
the
halls
of
light
my
version
lacks
the
glory
of
your
lines
but
mine
too
was
a
version
kepler
laughed
turned
into
latin
from
old
ptolemy
greek
for
even
in
verse
half
of
the
joy
i
think
is
just
to
pass
the
torch
from
hand
to
hand
an
undimmed
splendour
but
last
night
i
tried
some
music
all
my
own
i
had
a
dream
that
i
was
wandering
in
some
distant
world
i
have
often
dreamed
it
once
it
was
the
moon
i
wrote
that
down
in
prose
when
i
am
dead
it
may
be
printed
this
was
a
fairer
dream
for
i
was
walking
in
a
spring
upon
the
planet
venus
only
verse
could
spread
true
wings
for
that
delicious
world
and
so
i
wrote
it
for
no
eyes
but
mine
or
be
seized
on
doubtless
as
fresh
proof
of
poor
old
kepler
madness
let
me
hear
madman
to
madman
for
i
too
write
verse
then
kepler
in
a
rhythmic
murmur
breathed
his
rich
enchanted
memories
of
that
dream
beauty
burned
before
me
swinging
a
lanthorn
through
that
fragrant
night
i
followed
a
distant
singing
and
a
dreaming
light
how
she
led
me
i
can
not
tell
to
that
strange
world
afar
nor
how
i
walked
in
that
wild
glen
upon
the
sunset
star
winged
creatures
floated
under
those
boughs
of
violet
bloom
with
delicate
forms
unknown
on
earth
irised
plume
and
plume
and
crowned
with
unknown
flowers
for
nothing
in
that
enchanted
world
followed
the
way
of
ours
only
i
saw
that
beauty
on
hesper
as
on
earth
still
held
command
and
though
as
one
in
slumber
i
roamed
that
radiant
land
with
all
these
senses
sealed
to
what
the
hesperians
knew
the
faithful
lanthorn
of
her
law
was
mine
on
hesper
too
then
half
at
home
with
wonder
i
saw
strange
flocks
of
flowers
like
birds
take
flight
great
trees
that
burned
like
opals
to
lure
their
loves
at
night
dark
beings
that
could
move
in
realms
no
dream
of
ours
has
known
till
these
became
as
common
things
as
men
account
their
own
yet
when
that
lanthorn
led
me
back
to
the
world
where
once
i
thought
me
wise
i
saw
on
this
my
planet
what
souls
with
awful
eyes
hardly
i
dared
to
walk
her
fields
as
in
that
strange
i
looked
on
those
wild
miracles
the
birds
and
flowers
of
earth
silence
a
moment
held
them
loth
to
break
the
spell
of
that
strange
dream
one
proof
the
more
said
wotton
at
last
that
songs
can
mount
and
fly
to
truth
for
this
fantastic
vision
of
yours
of
life
in
other
spheres
awakes
in
me
either
that
slumbering
knowledge
of
socrates
or
some
strange
premonition
that
the
years
will
prove
it
true
this
music
leads
us
far
from
all
our
creeds
except
that
faith
in
law
your
quest
for
knowledge
how
it
rests
on
that
how
sure
the
soul
is
that
if
truth
destroy
the
temple
in
three
days
the
truth
will
build
a
nobler
temple
and
that
order
reigns
in
all
things
even
your
atheist
builds
his
doubt
on
that
strange
faith
destroys
his
heaven
and
god
in
absolute
faith
that
his
own
thought
is
true
to
law
god
lanthorn
to
our
stumbling
feet
and
so
despite
himself
he
worships
god
for
where
true
souls
are
there
are
god
and
heaven
it
is
an
ancient
wisdom
long
ago
said
kepler
under
the
glittering
eastern
sky
the
shepherd
king
looked
up
at
those
great
stars
those
ordered
hosts
and
cried
narrant
gloriam
dei
though
there
be
some
who
ape
lucretius
and
believe
themselves
epicureans
little
they
know
of
him
who
even
in
utter
darkness
bowed
his
head
to
something
nobler
than
the
gods
of
rome
reigning
beyond
the
darkness
they
accept
the
law
the
music
of
these
ordered
worlds
and
straight
deny
the
law
first
postulate
that
out
of
nothingness
nothing
can
be
born
nor
greater
things
from
less
can
music
rise
by
chance
from
chaos
as
they
said
that
star
in
serpentarius
rose
i
told
them
then
that
when
i
was
a
boy
with
time
to
spare
i
played
at
anagrams
out
of
my
latin
name
came
that
sinister
phrase
in
struck
by
this
i
tried
again
but
trusted
it
to
chance
i
took
some
playing
cards
and
wrote
on
each
one
letter
of
my
name
then
i
began
to
shuffle
them
and
at
every
shuffle
i
read
the
letters
in
their
order
as
they
came
to
see
what
meaning
chance
might
give
to
them
wotton
the
gods
and
goddesses
must
have
laughed
to
see
the
weeks
i
lost
in
studying
chance
for
had
i
scattered
those
cards
into
the
black
epicurean
eternity
i
swear
they
still
be
playing
at
in
the
dark
and
show
no
glimmer
of
sense
and
yet
to
hear
those
wittols
talk
you
think
you
but
to
mix
a
bushel
of
good
greek
letters
in
a
sack
and
shake
them
roundly
for
an
age
or
so
to
pour
the
odyssey
out
at
last
i
told
those
disputants
what
my
wife
had
said
one
night
when
i
was
tired
and
all
my
mind
with
pondering
on
their
atoms
i
was
called
to
supper
and
she
placed
before
me
there
a
most
delicious
salad
would
appear
i
thought
aloud
if
these
pewter
dishes
green
hearts
of
lettuce
tarragon
slips
of
thyme
slices
of
hard
boiled
egg
and
grains
of
salt
with
drops
of
water
vinegar
and
oil
had
in
a
bottomless
gulf
been
flying
about
from
all
eternity
one
sure
certain
day
the
sweet
invisible
hand
of
happy
chance
would
serve
them
as
a
salad
enough
my
wife
replied
not
so
good
as
mine
nor
so
well
dressed
they
laughed
susannah
voice
broke
in
i
made
a
better
one
the
receipt
came
from
the
i
have
dished
ducklings
and
peas
and
all
come
john
say
grace
iv
galileo
i
in
the
convent
at
arcetri
writes
to
her
old
lover
at
my
friend
my
dearest
friend
my
own
dear
love
i
who
am
dead
to
love
and
see
around
me
the
funeral
tapers
lighted
send
this
cry
out
of
my
heart
to
yours
before
the
end
you
told
me
once
you
would
endure
the
rack
to
save
my
heart
one
pang
o
save
it
now
last
night
there
came
a
dreadful
word
from
rome
for
my
dear
lord
and
father
summoning
him
before
the
inquisitors
there
to
take
his
trial
at
threescore
years
and
ten
there
is
a
threat
of
torture
if
his
lips
will
not
deny
the
truth
his
eyes
have
seen
you
know
my
father
you
know
me
too
you
never
will
believe
that
he
and
i
are
enemies
of
the
faith
could
i
who
put
away
all
earthly
love
deny
the
cross
to
which
i
nailed
this
flesh
could
he
who
on
the
night
when
all
those
heavens
opened
above
us
with
their
circling
worlds
knelt
with
me
crushed
beneath
that
weight
of
glory
forget
the
maker
of
that
glory
now
you
not
believe
it
neither
would
the
church
had
not
his
enemies
poisoned
all
the
springs
and
of
truth
it
is
not
rome
that
summons
him
but
magini
sizy
scheiner
lorini
all
the
blind
pedantic
crew
that
envy
him
his
fame
and
hate
his
works
for
dwarfing
theirs
must
such
things
always
be
when
truth
is
born
only
five
nights
ago
we
walked
together
my
father
and
i
here
in
the
convent
garden
and
as
the
dusk
turned
everything
to
dreams
we
dreamed
together
of
his
work
well
done
and
happiness
to
be
we
did
not
dream
that
even
then
muttering
above
his
book
his
enemies
those
enemies
whom
the
truth
stings
into
hate
were
plotting
to
destroy
him
yet
something
shadowed
him
i
recall
his
words
the
grapes
are
ripening
see
celeste
how
black
and
heavy
we
shall
have
good
wine
this
year
yes
all
grows
ripe
i
said
your
too
dear
father
are
you
happy
now
to
know
your
book
is
printed
and
the
new
world
born
he
shook
his
head
a
little
sadly
i
thought
autumn
too
full
of
endings
fruits
grow
ripe
and
fall
and
then
comes
winter
not
for
you
never
i
said
for
those
who
write
their
names
in
heaven
think
father
through
all
ages
now
no
one
can
ever
watch
that
starry
sky
without
remembering
you
your
fame
and
there
he
stopped
me
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
standing
in
the
darkness
with
dead
leaves
drifting
around
him
and
his
bare
grey
head
bowed
in
complete
humility
his
voice
shaken
and
low
he
said
like
one
in
prayer
celeste
beware
of
that
say
truth
not
fame
if
there
be
any
happiness
on
earth
it
springs
from
truth
alone
the
truth
we
live
in
act
and
thought
i
have
looked
up
there
and
seen
too
many
worlds
to
talk
of
fame
on
earth
fame
on
this
grain
of
dust
among
the
stars
the
trumpet
of
a
gnat
that
thinks
to
halt
the
great
moving
on
their
way
in
silence
yes
that
fame
but
truth
celeste
truth
and
its
laws
are
constant
even
up
there
that
where
one
man
may
face
and
fight
the
world
his
weakness
turns
to
strength
he
is
made
one
with
universal
forces
and
he
holds
the
password
to
eternity
gate
after
gate
swings
back
through
all
the
heavens
no
sentry
halts
him
and
no
flaming
sword
say
truth
celeste
not
fame
no
for
i
say
a
better
word
i
told
him
i
say
love
he
took
my
face
between
his
hands
and
said
his
face
all
dark
between
me
and
the
stars
what
love
celeste
but
this
dear
face
of
truth
upturned
to
heaven
he
left
me
and
i
heard
some
twelve
hours
later
that
this
man
whose
soul
was
dedicate
to
truth
was
threatened
now
with
torture
if
his
lips
did
not
deny
the
truth
he
loved
i
tell
you
all
these
things
because
to
help
him
you
must
understand
him
and
even
you
may
doubt
him
if
you
hear
only
those
plausible
outside
witnesses
who
never
heard
his
as
have
i
so
let
me
tell
you
all
his
quest
for
truth
and
how
this
hate
began
even
from
the
first
he
made
his
enemies
of
those
who
chanced
upon
some
new
thing
in
the
dark
and
could
not
see
its
meaning
for
he
saw
always
the
law
illumining
it
within
so
when
he
heard
of
that
strange
which
brought
the
distance
near
he
thought
it
out
by
reason
where
that
other
hit
upon
it
only
by
chance
he
made
his
telescope
and
o
how
vividly
that
day
comes
back
when
in
their
gorgeous
robes
the
senate
stood
beside
him
on
that
high
venetian
tower
scanning
the
bare
blue
sea
that
showed
no
speck
of
sail
then
one
by
one
he
bade
them
look
and
one
by
one
they
gasped
a
miracle
brown
sails
and
red
a
fleet
of
fishing
boats
see
how
the
bright
foam
bursts
around
their
bows
see
how
the
sailors
walk
the
decks
then
quickly
looking
up
as
if
to
catch
the
vision
ere
it
tricked
them
all
they
saw
was
empty
sea
again
many
believed
that
all
was
trickery
but
he
bade
them
note
the
colours
of
the
boats
and
count
their
sails
then
in
a
little
while
the
naked
eye
saw
on
the
certain
specks
that
grew
took
form
and
colour
and
within
an
hour
their
magic
fleet
came
foaming
into
port
whereat
old
senators
wagging
their
white
beards
and
plucking
at
golden
chains
with
stiff
old
claws
too
feeble
for
the
squeaked
at
once
this
glass
will
give
us
great
advantages
in
time
of
war
war
war
o
god
of
love
even
amidst
their
wonder
at
thy
world
dazed
with
new
beauty
gifted
with
new
powers
these
old
men
dreamed
of
blood
this
was
the
thought
to
which
all
else
must
pander
if
he
hoped
even
for
one
hour
to
see
those
dull
eyes
blaze
at
his
discoveries
wolves
he
called
them
wolves
and
yet
he
humoured
them
he
stooped
to
them
promised
them
more
advantages
and
talked
as
elders
do
to
children
you
may
call
it
weakness
and
yet
could
any
man
do
more
alone
against
a
world
with
such
a
trust
to
guard
for
future
ages
all
his
life
he
has
had
some
weanling
truth
to
guard
has
fought
desperately
to
defend
it
taking
cover
wherever
he
could
behind
old
fallen
trees
of
superstition
or
ruins
of
old
thought
he
has
read
horoscopes
to
keep
his
work
among
the
stars
in
favour
with
his
prince
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
understand
what
seems
inconstant
in
him
it
may
be
that
he
was
wrong
in
these
things
and
must
pay
a
dreadful
penalty
but
you
must
explore
his
mind
great
ranges
plains
and
lonely
peaks
before
you
know
him
as
i
know
him
now
how
could
he
talk
to
children
but
in
words
that
children
understand
have
not
some
said
that
god
himself
has
made
his
glory
dark
for
men
to
bear
it
in
his
human
sphere
my
father
has
done
this
war
was
the
dream
that
filmed
those
old
men
eyes
they
did
not
hear
my
father
when
he
hinted
at
his
hope
of
opening
up
the
heavens
for
mankind
with
that
new
power
of
bringing
far
things
near
my
heart
burned
as
i
heard
him
but
they
blinked
like
owls
at
noonday
then
i
saw
him
turn
desperately
to
humour
them
from
thoughts
of
heaven
to
thoughts
of
warfare
late
that
night
my
own
dear
lord
and
father
came
to
me
and
whispered
with
a
glory
in
his
face
as
one
who
has
looked
on
things
too
beautiful
to
breathe
aloud
come
out
celeste
and
see
a
miracle
i
followed
him
he
showed
me
looking
along
his
outstretched
hand
a
star
a
point
of
light
above
our
it
was
the
star
called
jupiter
and
then
he
bade
me
look
again
but
through
his
glass
i
feared
to
look
at
first
lest
i
should
see
some
wonder
never
meant
for
mortal
eyes
he
too
had
felt
the
same
not
fear
but
awe
as
if
his
hand
were
laid
upon
the
veil
between
this
world
and
heaven
then
i
too
saw
small
as
the
smallest
bead
of
mist
that
clings
to
a
spider
thread
at
dawn
the
floating
disk
of
what
had
been
a
star
a
planet
now
and
near
it
with
no
disk
that
eyes
could
see
four
of
light
unseen
before
the
moons
of
jupiter
he
whispered
low
i
have
watched
them
as
they
moved
from
night
to
night
a
system
like
our
own
although
the
world
their
fourfold
lights
and
shadows
make
so
strange
must
as
i
think
be
mightier
than
we
dreamed
a
titan
planet
earth
begins
to
fade
and
dwindle
yes
the
heavens
are
opening
now
perhaps
up
there
this
night
some
lonely
soul
gazes
at
earth
watches
our
dawning
moon
and
wonders
as
we
wonder
in
that
dark
we
knelt
together
very
strange
to
see
the
vanity
and
fickleness
of
princes
before
his
enemies
had
provoked
the
wrath
of
rome
against
him
he
had
given
the
name
of
medicean
stars
to
those
four
moons
in
honour
of
prince
cosmo
this
aroused
the
court
of
france
to
seek
a
lasting
place
upon
the
map
of
heaven
a
letter
came
beseeching
him
to
find
another
star
even
more
brilliant
and
to
call
it
after
the
reigning
and
most
brilliant
prince
of
france
they
did
not
wish
the
family
name
of
bourbon
this
would
dissipate
the
glory
no
they
preferred
his
proper
name
of
henri
we
read
it
together
in
the
garden
here
weeping
with
laughter
never
dreaming
then
that
this
this
this
could
stir
the
little
hearts
of
men
to
envy
o
but
afterwards
the
blindness
of
the
men
who
thought
themselves
his
enemies
the
men
who
never
knew
him
the
men
that
had
set
up
a
thing
of
straw
and
called
it
by
his
name
and
wished
to
burn
their
image
and
himself
in
one
wild
fire
men
were
they
men
or
children
they
refused
even
to
look
through
galileo
glass
lest
seeing
might
persuade
them
even
that
sage
that
great
aristotelian
julius
libri
holding
his
breath
there
like
a
fractious
child
until
his
cheeks
grew
purple
and
the
veins
were
bursting
on
his
brow
swore
he
would
die
sooner
than
look
and
that
poor
monstrous
babe
not
long
thereafter
kept
his
word
and
died
died
of
his
own
pent
rage
as
i
have
heard
whereat
my
lord
and
father
shook
his
head
and
smiling
somewhat
sadly
oh
you
know
that
smile
of
his
more
deadly
to
the
false
than
even
his
reasoning
murmured
libri
dead
who
called
the
moons
of
jupiter
absurd
he
swore
he
would
not
look
at
them
from
earth
i
hope
he
saw
them
on
his
way
to
heaven
welser
in
augsburg
clavius
at
rome
scoffed
at
the
fabled
moons
of
jupiter
it
was
a
trick
they
said
he
had
made
a
glass
to
fool
the
world
with
false
appearances
perhaps
the
lens
was
flawed
perhaps
his
wits
were
wandering
anything
rather
than
the
truth
which
might
disturb
the
mighty
in
their
seat
let
galileo
hold
his
own
opinions
i
clavius
will
hold
mine
he
wrote
to
kepler
you
kepler
are
the
first
whose
open
mind
and
lofty
genius
could
accept
for
truth
the
things
which
i
have
seen
with
you
for
friend
the
abuse
of
the
multitude
will
not
trouble
me
jupiter
stands
in
heaven
and
will
stand
though
all
the
sycophants
bark
at
him
in
pisa
florence
bologna
venice
padua
many
have
seen
the
moons
these
witnesses
are
silent
and
uncertain
do
you
wonder
most
of
them
could
not
even
when
they
saw
them
distinguish
mars
from
jupiter
shall
we
side
with
heraclitus
or
democritus
i
think
my
kepler
we
will
only
laugh
at
this
immeasurable
stupidity
picture
the
leaders
of
our
college
here
a
thousand
times
i
have
offered
them
the
proof
of
their
own
eyes
they
sleep
here
like
gorged
snakes
refusing
even
to
look
at
planets
moons
or
telescope
they
think
philosophy
is
all
in
books
and
that
the
truth
is
found
neither
in
nature
nor
the
universe
but
in
comparing
texts
how
you
would
laugh
had
you
but
heard
our
first
philosopher
before
the
grand
duke
trying
to
tear
down
and
argue
the
new
planets
out
of
heaven
now
by
his
own
weird
logic
and
closed
eyes
and
now
by
magic
spells
how
could
he
help
despising
them
a
little
it
an
error
even
for
a
giant
to
despise
a
midge
for
when
the
giant
reels
beneath
some
stroke
of
fate
the
buzzing
clouds
will
swoop
upon
him
cluster
and
feed
upon
his
bleeding
wounds
and
do
what
midges
can
to
sting
him
blind
these
human
midges
have
not
missed
their
chance
they
have
missed
no
smallest
spot
upon
that
sun
my
mother
was
not
married
they
have
found
to
my
dear
father
all
his
children
then
and
doubtless
all
their
thoughts
are
evil
too
but
who
that
judged
him
ever
sought
to
know
whether
as
evil
sometimes
wears
the
cloak
of
virtue
nobler
virtue
in
this
man
might
wear
that
outward
semblance
of
a
sin
yes
even
you
who
love
me
may
believe
these
thoughts
are
born
of
my
own
tainted
heart
and
yet
i
write
them
kneeling
in
my
cell
and
whisper
them
to
one
who
blesses
me
here
from
his
cross
upon
the
bare
grey
wall
so
if
you
love
me
bless
me
also
you
by
helping
him
make
plain
to
all
you
meet
what
part
his
enemies
have
played
in
this
how
some
one
somehow
altered
the
command
laid
on
him
all
those
years
ago
by
rome
so
that
it
reads
as
if
he
vowed
never
to
think
or
breathe
that
this
round
earth
moves
with
its
round
the
sun
is
true
he
promised
not
to
write
or
speak
as
if
this
truth
were
equally
with
god
eternal
laws
and
so
he
wrote
his
dialogues
reasoning
for
it
and
against
and
gave
the
last
word
to
simplicio
saying
that
human
reason
must
bow
down
before
the
power
of
god
and
even
this
his
enemies
have
twisted
to
a
sneer
against
the
pope
and
cunningly
declared
simplicio
to
be
urban
why
my
friend
there
were
three
dolphins
on
the
titlepage
each
with
the
tail
of
another
in
its
mouth
the
censor
had
not
seen
this
and
they
swore
it
held
some
hidden
meaning
then
they
found
the
same
three
dolphins
sprawled
on
all
the
books
landini
printed
at
his
florence
press
they
tried
another
charge
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
truth
that
they
can
bring
against
him
but
o
my
friend
i
more
than
fear
their
lies
i
do
not
fear
the
justice
of
our
god
but
i
do
fear
the
vanity
of
men
even
of
urban
not
his
holiness
but
urban
the
weak
man
who
may
resent
and
in
resentment
rush
to
meet
this
cunning
lie
with
credence
vanity
o
half
the
wrongs
on
earth
arise
from
that
greed
and
war
pomp
all
envy
and
most
hate
are
born
of
that
while
one
dear
humble
heart
beating
with
love
for
man
between
two
thieves
proves
more
than
all
his
wounds
and
miracles
our
crucified
to
be
the
son
of
god
say
that
i
long
to
see
him
that
my
prayers
knock
at
the
gates
of
mercy
night
and
day
urge
him
to
leave
the
judgment
now
with
god
and
strive
no
more
if
he
be
right
the
stars
fight
for
him
in
their
courses
let
him
bow
his
poor
dishonoured
glorious
old
grey
head
before
this
storm
and
then
come
home
to
me
o
quickly
or
i
fear
be
too
late
for
i
am
dying
do
not
tell
him
this
but
i
must
live
to
hold
his
hands
again
and
know
that
he
is
safe
i
dare
not
leave
him
helpless
and
half
blind
half
father
and
half
child
to
rack
and
cord
by
all
the
christ
within
you
save
him
you
and
though
you
may
have
ceased
to
love
me
now
one
faithful
shadow
in
your
own
last
hour
shall
watch
beside
you
till
all
shadows
die
and
heaven
unfold
to
bless
you
where
i
failed

to
castelli
after
the
what
think
you
of
your
galileo
now
your
hero
that
like
ajax
should
defy
the
lightning
yesterday
i
saw
him
stand
trembling
before
our
court
of
cardinals
trembling
before
the
colour
of
their
robes
as
sheep
before
the
slaughter
at
the
sight
and
smell
of
blood
his
lips
could
hardly
speak
and
mark
you
neither
rack
nor
cord
had
touched
him
out
of
the
inquisition
five
degrees
of
rigor
first
the
public
threat
of
torture
second
the
repetition
of
the
threat
within

where

show
the
instruments
of
torture
to
the
accused
third
the
undressing
and
the
binding
fourth

him
on

rack
then
fifth
and
last
torture
out
of
these
your
galileo
reached
the
second
only
when
clapping
both
his
hands
against
his
sides
he
whined
about
a
rupture
that
forbade
these
extreme
courses
great
heroic
soul
dropped
like
a
cur
into
a
sea
of
terror
he
sank
right
under
then
he
came
up
gasping
ready
to
swear
deny
abjure
recant
anything
everything
foolish
weak
old
man
who
had
been
so
proud
of
his
discoveries
and
dared
to
teach
his
betters
how
we
grinned
to
see
him
kneeling
there
and
whispering
thus
through
his
white
lips
bending
his
old
grey
head

writes
enclosing
schemer
letter
to
campanella
what
think
i
this
that
he
has
laid
his
hands
like
samson
on
the
pillars
of
our
world
and
one
more
trembling
utterance
such
as
this
will
overwhelm
us
all
o
campanella
you
know
that
i
am
loyal
to
our
faith
as
galileo
too
has
always
been
you
know
that
i
believe
as
he
believes
in
the
one
catholic
apostolic
church
yet
there
are
many
times
when
i
could
wish
that
some
blind
samson
would
indeed
tear
down
all
this
proud
temporal
fabric
made
with
hands
and
that
once
more
we
suffered
with
our
lord
were
persecuted
crucified
with
him
i
tell
you
campanella
on
that
day
when
galileo
faced
our
cardinals
a
veil
was
rent
for
me
there
in
one
flash
i
saw
the
eternal
tragedy
transformed
into
new
terms
i
saw
the
christ
once
more
before
the
court
of
pilate
peter
there
denied
him
once
again
and
as
for
me
never
has
all
my
soul
so
humbly
knelt
to
god
in
christ
as
when
that
sad
old
man
bowed
his
grey
head
and
knelt
at
seventy
years
to
acquiesce
and
shake
the
world
with
shame
shall
not
strive
or
strange
is
it
not
how
nearly
scheiner
even
amidst
his
hate
quoted
the
prophets
do
we
think
this
world
so
greatly
bettered
that
the
ancient
cry
hails
our
god
no
more
iv
writes
to
her
father
in
his
imprisonment
at
dear
father
it
will
seem
a
thousand
years
until
i
see
you
home
again
and
well
i
would
not
have
you
doubt
that
all
this
time
i
have
prayed
for
you
continually
i
saw
a
copy
of
your
sentence
i
was
grieved
and
yet
it
gladdened
me
for
i
found
a
way
to
be
of
use
by
taking
on
myself
your
penance
therefore
if
you
fail
in
this
if
you
forget
it
and
indeed
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
remembering
it
your
child
will
do
it
for
you
ah
could
she
do
more
how
willingly
would
your
celeste
endure
a
straiter
prison
than
she
lives
in
now
to
set
you
free
a
prison
i
have
said
and
yet
if
you
were
here
not
be
so
when
you
were
pent
in
rome
i
used
to
say
would
he
were
at
siena
god
fulfilled
that
wish
you
are
at
siena
and
i
now
say
would
he
were
at
arcctri
so
perhaps
little
by
little
angels
can
be
wooed
each
day
by
some
new
prayer
of
mine
or
yours
to
bring
you
wholly
back
to
me
and
save
some
few
of
the
flying
days
that
yet
remain
you
see
these
other
nuns
have
each
their
friend
their
patron
saint
their
ever
near
to
whom
they
tell
their
joys
and
griefs
but
i
have
only
you
dear
father
and
if
you
were
only
near
me
i
could
want
no
more
your
garden
looks
as
if
it
missed
your
love
the
unpruned
branches
lean
against
the
wall
to
look
for
you
the
walks
run
wild
with
flowers
even
your
seems
to
wait
for
you
and
though
the
fruit
is
not
so
good
this
year
the
vines
were
hurt
by
hail
i
think
and
thieves
have
climbed
the
wall
too
often
for
the
pears
the
crop
of
peas
is
good
and
only
waits
your
hand
to
gather
it
in
the
dovecote
too
you
find
some
plump
young
pigeons
we
must
make
a
feast
for
your
return
in
my
small
plot
here
at
the
convent
better
watched
than
yours
i
raised
a
little
harvest
with
the
price
i
got
for
it
i
had
three
masses
said
for
my
dear
father
sake
v
galileo
writes
to
his
friend
castelli
after
his
return
to
arcetri
castelli
o
castelli
she
is
dead
i
found
her
driving
death
back
with
her
soul
till
i
should
come
i
could
not
even
see
her
these
useless
eyes
had
spent
their
power
on
distant
worlds
and
lost
that
last
faint
look
of
love
on
earth
i
am
in
the
dark
castelli
utterly
and
irreparably
blind
the
universe
which
once
these
outworn
eyes
enlarged
so
far
beyond
its
ancient
bounds
is
henceforth
shrunk
into
that
narrow
space
which
i
myself
inhabit
yet
i
found
even
in
the
dark
her
tears
against
my
face
her
thin
soft
childish
arms
around
my
neck
and
her
voice
whispering
love
undying
love
asking
me
at
this
last
to
tell
her
true
if
we
should
meet
again
her
trust
in
me
had
shaken
her
faith
in
what
my
judges
held
and
as
i
felt
her
fingers
clutch
my
hand
like
a
child
drowning
tell
me
the
truth
she
said
before
i
lose
the
light
of
your
dear
face
it
seemed
so
strange
that
dying
she
could
see
me
while
i
had
lost
her
tell
me
before
i
go
believe
in
love
was
all
my
soul
could
breathe
i
heard
no
answer
only
i
felt
her
hand
clasp
mine
and
hold
it
tighter
then
she
died
and
left
me
to
my
darkness
could
i
guess
at
unseen
glories
in
this
deeper
night
make
new
discoveries
of
profounder
realms
within
the
soul
o
could
i
find
him
there
rise
to
him
through
his
harmonies
of
law
and
make
his
will
my
own
this
much
at
least
i
know
already
that
in
some
strange
way
his
law
implies
his
love
for
failing
that
all
grows
discordant
and
the
primal
power
ignobler
than
his
children
so
i
trust
one
day
to
find
her
waiting
for
me
still
when
all
things
are
made
new
i
raise
this
torch
of
knowledge
it
is
one
with
my
right
hand
and
the
dark
sap
that
keeps
it
burning
flows
out
of
my
heart
and
yet
for
all
my
faith
it
shows
me
only
darkness
was
i
wrong
did
i
forget
the
subtler
truth
of
rome
and
in
my
pride
obscure
the
world
one
light
did
i
subordinate
to
this
moving
earth
our
god
o
my
celeste
once
once
at
least
you
knew
far
more
than
i
and
she
is
dead
castelli
she
is
dead
vi
many
years
later
writes
to
a
friend
in
i
was
his
last
disciple
as
you
say
i
went
to
him
at
seventeen
years
of
age
and
offered
him
my
hands
and
eyes
to
use
when
voicing
the
true
mind
and
heart
of
rome
father
castelli
his
most
faithful
friend
wrote
for
my
master
that
compassionate
plea
noblest
eye
that
nature
ever
made
is
darkened
one
so
exquisitely
dowered
so
delicate
in
power
that
it
beheld
more
than
all
other
eyes
in
ages
gone
and
opened
the
eyes
of
all
that
are
to
but
out
of
england
even
then
there
shone
the
first
ethereal
promise
of
light
that
crowns
my
master
dead
well
i
recall
that
day
of
days
there
was
no
faintest
breath
among
his
garden
they
dreamed
dark
on
a
sky
too
beautiful
for
tears
and
the
first
star
was
trembling
overhead
when
quietly
as
a
messenger
from
heaven
moving
unseen
through
his
own
purer
realm
amongst
the
shadows
of
our
mortal
world
a
young
man
with
a
strange
light
on
his
face
knocked
at
the
door
of
galileo
house
his
name
was
milton
by
the
hand
of
god
he
the
one
living
soul
on
earth
with
power
to
read
the
starry
soul
of
this
blind
man
was
led
through
italy
to
his
prison
door
he
looked
on
galileo
touched
his
hand
dark
dark
dark
amid
the
blaze
of
noon
irrecoverably
dark
in
after
days
he
wrote
it
but
it
pulsed
within
him
then
and
galileo
rising
to
his
feet
and
turning
on
him
those
unseeing
eyes
that
had
searched
heaven
and
seen
so
many
worlds
said
to
him
you
have
found
me
often
he
told
me
in
those
last
sad
months
of
how
your
grave
young
island
poet
brought
peace
to
him
with
the
knowledge
that
far
off
in
other
lands
the
truth
he
had
proclaimed
was
gathering
power
soon
after
death
unlocked
his
prison
and
the
city
that
he
loved
florence
his
town
of
flowers
whose
gates
in
life
he
was
forbid
to
pass
received
him
dead
you
write
to
me
from
england
that
his
name
is
now
among
the
mightiest
in
the
world
and
in
his
name
i
thank
you
i
am
old
and
i
was
very
young
when
long
ago
i
stood
beside
his
poor
dishonoured
grave
where
hate
denied
him
even
an
epitaph
and
i
have
seen
slowly
and
silently
his
purer
fame
arising
like
a
moon
in
marble
on
the
twilight
of
those
aisles
at
santa
croce
where
the
dread
decree
was
read
against
him
now
against
two
wrongs
let
me
defend
two
victims
first
the
church
whom
many
have
vilified
for
my
master
doom
and
second
galileo
whom
they
reproach
because
they
think
that
in
his
blind
old
age
he
might
with
one
great
eagle
glance
have
cowed
his
judges
played
the
hero
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
and
posturing
like
a
mummer
cried
as
one
empty
rumour
now
declares
after
his
recantation
it
out
of
this
wild
confusion
fourfold
wrongs
are
heaped
on
both
i
would
fain
bring
peace
the
peace
of
truth
to
both
before
i
die
and
as
i
hope
rest
at
my
master
feet
it
was
not
rome
that
tried
to
murder
truth
but
the
blind
hate
and
vanity
of
man
had
galileo
but
concealed
the
smile
with
which
like
socrates
he
answered
fools
they
would
not
in
the
name
of
christ
have
mixed
this
hemlock
in
his
chalice
o
pitiful
pitiful
human
hearts
that
must
deny
their
own
unfolding
heavens
for
one
light
word
twisted
by
whispering
malice
did
he
mean
simplicio
in
his
dialogues
for
the
pope
doubtful
enough
the
name
was
borrowed
straight
from
older
dialogues
if
he
gave
one
thought
of
urban
to
simplicio
you
know
well
how
composite
are
all
characters
in
books
how
authors
find
their
colours
here
and
there
and
paint
both
saints
and
villains
from
themselves
no
matter
this
was
urban
make
it
clear
simplicio
means
a
simpleton
the
saints
are
aroused
by
ridicule
to
most
human
wrath
urban
was
once
his
friend
this
hint
of
ours
kills
all
of
that
and
so
we
mortals
close
the
doors
of
love
and
knowledge
on
the
world
and
so
for
many
an
age
the
name
of
christ
has
been
misused
by
man
to
mask
man
hate
how
should
the
church
escape
then
i
who
loved
my
master
know
he
had
no
truer
friend
than
many
of
those
true
servants
of
the
church
fathers
and
priests
who
in
their
lowlier
sphere
moved
nearer
than
her
cardinals
to
the
christ
these
were
the
very
rome
and
held
her
keys
those
who
charge
rome
with
hatred
of
the
light
would
charge
the
sun
with
darkness
and
accuse
this
dome
of
sky
for
all
the
wrongs
that
men
commit
beneath
it
art
and
song
that
found
her
once
in
europe
their
sole
shrine
and
sanctuary
absolve
her
from
that
stain
but
there
this
other
charge
against
my
friend
and
master
galileo
it
is
brought
by
friends
made
sharper
by
their
pity
and
grief
the
charge
that
he
refused
his
martyrdom
and
so
denied
his
own
high
faith
whose
faith
his
friends
his
protestant
followers
or
his
own
faced
by
the
torture
that
sublime
old
man
was
still
a
faithful
catholic
and
his
thought
plunged
deeper
than
his
protestant
followers
knew
his
aim
was
not
to
strike
a
blow
at
rome
but
to
confound
his
enemies
he
believed
as
humbly
as
castelli
or
celeste
that
there
is
nothing
absolute
but
that
power
with
which
his
church
confronted
him
to
this
he
bowed
his
head
acknowledging
that
his
light
was
darkness
but
affirming
all
the
more
that
ptolemy
light
was
even
darker
yet
read
your
own
protestant
milton
who
derived
his
mighty
argument
from
my
master
lips
whether
the
sun
predominant
in
heaven
rise
on
the
earth
or
earth
rise
on
the
sun
leave
them
to
god
above
him
serve
and
fear
just
as
in
boyhood
when
my
master
watched
the
swinging
lamp
in
the
cathedral
there
at
pisa
and
by
one
finger
on
his
pulse
found
that
although
the
great
bronze
miracle
swung
through
spaces
yet
it
moved
more
slowly
and
so
still
swung
in
equal
times
he
straight
devised
another
boon
to
man
those
which
by
many
a
fevered
bed
our
doctors
use
dreamed
of
that
timepiece
too
whose
punctual
swinging
pendulum
on
earth
measures
the
starry
periods
and
talks
peacefully
to
children
by
the
fire
like
an
old
grandad
full
of
ancient
tales
remembering
endless
ages
and
foretelling
eternities
to
come
but
all
the
while
there
in
the
dim
cathedral
he
knew
well
that
dreaming
youngster
with
his
tawny
mane
of
hair
and
deep
ethereal
eyes
what
odorous
clouds
of
incense
round
him
rose
was
conscious
in
the
dimness
of
great
throngs
kneeling
around
him
shared
in
his
own
heart
the
music
and
the
silence
and
the
cry
salutaris
hostia
so
now
there
was
no
mortal
conflict
in
his
mind
between
his
and
things
absolute
and
one
far
voice
most
absolute
of
all
feeble
with
suffering
calling
night
and
day
the
voice
of
his
celeste
all
these
things
and
the
less
were
comprehended
like
the
swinging
lamp
within
that
great
cathedral
of
his
soul
often
he
bade
me
in
that
desolate
house
of
old
a
jewel
of
light
read
to
him
one
sad
letter
till
he
knew
the
most
of
it
by
heart
and
while
he
walked
his
garden
leaning
on
my
arm
at
times
i
think
he
quite
forgot
that
i
was
there
for
he
would
quietly
murmur
it
to
himself
as
if
she
had
sent
it
half
an
hour
ago
now
with
this
little
winter
gift
of
fruit
i
send
you
father
from
our
southward
wall
our
convent
rarest
flower
a
christmas
rose
at
this
cold
season
it
should
please
you
much
seeing
how
rare
it
is
but
with
the
rose
you
must
accept
its
thorns
which
bring
to
mind
our
lord
own
bitter
passion
its
green
leaves
image
the
hope
that
through
his
passion
we
after
this
winter
of
our
mortal
life
may
find
the
beauty
of
an
eternal
spring
in
heaven
praise
me
the
martyr
out
of
whose
agonies
some
great
new
hope
is
born
but
not
the
fool
who
starves
his
heart
to
prove
what
eyes
can
see
and
intellect
confirm
throughout
the
world
why
must
he
follow
the
idiot
schoolboy
code
torture
his
soul
to
reinforce
the
sight
of
those
that
closed
their
eyes
and
would
not
see
to
your
own
men
of
science
fifty
turns
of
the
thumbscrew
would
not
prove
that
earth
revolved
call
it
italian
subtlety
if
you
will
i
say
his
intricate
cause
could
not
be
won
by
blind
heroics
much
that
his
enemies
challenged
was
not
yet
wholly
proven
though
his
mind
had
leapt
to
a
certainty
he
must
leave
the
rest
to
those
that
should
come
after
swift
and
young
those
runners
with
the
torch
for
whom
he
longed
as
his
deliverers
had
he
chosen
death
before
his
hour
his
proofs
had
been
obscured
for
many
a
year
his
respite
gave
him
time
to
push
new
pawns
out
in
the
blindfold
play
of
those
last
months
and
checkmate
not
the
church
but
those
that
hid
behind
her
he
believed
his
truth
was
all
harmonious
with
her
own
how
could
he
choose
between
them
must
he
die
to
affirm
a
discord
that
himself
denied
on
many
a
point
he
was
less
sure
than
we
but
surer
far
of
much
that
we
forget
the
movements
that
he
saw
he
could
but
judge
by
some
fixed
point
in
space
he
chose
the
sun
could
this
be
absolute
could
he
then
be
sure
that
this
great
sun
did
not
with
all
its
worlds
move
round
a
deeper
centre
what
became
of
your
copernicus
then
could
he
be
sure
of
any
unchanging
centre
whence
to
judge
this
universe
but
one
the
absolute
throne
of
god
affirming
this
eternal
rock
his
own
uncertainties
became
more
certain
and
although
his
lips
breathed
not
a
syllable
of
it
though
he
stood
silent
as
earth
that
also
seemed
so
still
the
very
silence
thundered
it
he
held
to
what
he
knew
secured
his
work
through
feeble
hands
like
mine
in
other
lands
not
least
in
england
as
i
think
you
know
for
partly
through
your
poet
as
i
believe
when
his
great
music
rolled
upon
your
skies
new
thoughts
were
kindled
in
the
general
mind
was
at
arcetri
that
your
milton
gained
the
first
great
glimpse
of
his
celestial
realm
picture
him
still
a
prisoner
of
our
light
closing
his
glorious
eyes
that
in
the
dark
he
might
behold
this
wheeling
universe
the
planets
gilding
their
ethereal
horns
with
many
a
pure
immortal
phrase
in
his
own
work
as
i
have
pondered
it
lived
first
upon
the
lips
of
him
whose
eyes
were
darkened
first
in
whom
too
milton
found
that
samson
agonistes
not
himself
as
many
have
thought
but
my
dear
master
dead
these
are
a
part
of
england
memories
now
the
music
blown
upon
her
air
when
in
the
year
of
galileo
death
newton
the
mightiest
of
the
sons
of
light
was
born
to
lift
the
splendour
of
this
torch
and
carry
it
as
i
heard
that
tycho
said
long
since
to
kepler
carry
it
out
of
sight
into
the
great
new
age
i
must
not
know
into
the
great
new
realm
i
must
not
tread
v
newton
i
if
i
saw
farther
was
because
i
stood
on
giant
shoulders
wrote
the
king
of
thought
too
proud
of
his
great
line
to
slight
the
toils
of
his
forebears
he
turned
to
their
dim
past
their
fading
victories
and
their
fond
defeats
and
knelt
as
at
an
altar
drawing
all
their
strengths
into
his
own
and
so
went
forth
with
all
their
glory
shining
in
his
face
to
win
new
victories
for
the
age
to
come
so
where
copernicus
had
destroyed
the
dream
we
called
our
world
where
galileo
watched
those
ancient
firmaments
melt
a
thin
blue
smoke
into
a
vaster
night
where
kepler
heard
only
stray
fragments
isolated
chords
of
that
tremendous
music
which
should
bind
all
things
anew
in
one
newton
arose
and
carried
on
their
fire
around
him
reeled
through
lingering
fumes
of
hate
and
clouds
of
doubt
lit
by
the
afterglow
of
the
civil
war
the
dissolute
throngs
of
that
walpurgis
night
where
all
the
cynical
spirits
that
deny
danced
with
the
vicious
lusts
that
drown
the
soul
in
flesh
too
gross
for
circe
or
her
swine
but
in
his
heart
he
heard
one
instant
voice
on
with
the
torch
once
more
make
all
things
new
build
the
new
heaven
and
earth
and
save
the
world
ah
but
the
infinite
patience
the
long
months
lavished
on
tasks
that
to
the
common
eye
were
insignificant
never
to
be
crowned
with
great
results
or
even
with
earth
rewards
could
rembrandt
but
have
painted
him
in
those
hours
making
his
first
analysis
of
light
alone
there
in
his
darkened
cambridge
room
at
trinity
could
he
have
painted
too
the
secret
glow
the
mystery
and
the
power
the
sense
of
all
the
thoughts
and
unseen
spires
that
soared
to
heaven
around
him
he
stood
there
obscure
unknown
the
shadow
of
a
man
in
darkness
like
a
grey
dishevelled
ghost
down
at
heel
his
last
night
supper
littering
his
desk
untouched
his
glimmering
face
under
his
tangled
hair
intent
and
still
preparing
our
new
universe
he
caught
the
sunbeam
striking
through
that
in
his
closed
shutter
a
round
white
spot
of
light
upon
a
small
dark
screen
he
interposed
a
prism
of
glass
he
saw
the
sunbeam
break
and
spread
upon
the
screen
its
rainbow
band
of
disentangled
colours
all
in
scale
like
notes
in
music
first
the
violet
ray
then
indigo
trembling
softly
into
blue
then
green
and
yellow
quivering
side
by
side
then
orange
mellowing
richly
into
red
then
in
the
screen
he
made
a
small
round
hole
like
to
the
first
and
through
it
passed
once
more
each
separate
coloured
ray
he
let
it
strike
another
prism
of
glass
and
saw
each
hue
bent
at
a
different
angle
from
its
path
the
red
the
least
the
violet
ray
the
most
but
all
in
scale
and
order
all
precise
as
notes
in
music
last
he
took
a
lens
and
passing
through
it
all
those
coloured
rays
drew
them
together
again
remerging
all
on
that
dark
screen
in
one
white
spot
of
light
so
watching
testing
proving
he
resolved
the
seeming
random
glories
of
our
day
into
a
constant
harmony
and
found
how
in
the
whiteness
of
the
sunlight
sleep
compounded
all
the
colours
of
the
world
he
saw
how
raindrops
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
breaking
the
light
revealed
that
sevenfold
arch
of
colours
ranged
as
on
his
own
dark
screen
though
now
they
spanned
the
mountains
and
wild
seas
then
where
that
order
had
gone
down
beneath
a
darker
deluge
he
beheld
gleams
of
the
great
new
order
and
recalled
fraught
with
new
meaning
and
a
deeper
hope
that
covenant
which
god
made
with
all
mankind
throughout
all
generations
will
set
my
bow
in
the
cloud
that
henceforth
ye
may
know
how
deeper
than
the
wreckage
of
your
dreams
abides
my
law
in
beauty
and
in
power
ii
yet
for
that
exquisite
balance
of
the
mind
he
too
must
pay
the
price
he
stood
alone
bewildered
at
the
sudden
assault
of
fools
on
this
his
first
discovery
i
have
lost
the
most
substantial
blessing
of
my
quiet
to
follow
a
vain
shadow
i
would
fain
attempt
no
more
so
few
can
understand
or
read
one
thought
so
many
are
ready
at
once
to
swoop
and
sting
indeed
i
would
withdraw
for
ever
from
philosophy
so
he
wrote
in
grief
the
mightiest
mind
of
that
new
age
let
those
who
stone
the
roman
curia
for
all
the
griefs
that
galileo
knew
remember
the
dark
hours
that
quenched
the
splendour
of
that
spirit
he
could
not
sleep
yet
with
that
patience
of
the
god
in
man
that
still
must
seek
the
splendour
whence
it
came
through
midnight
hours
of
mockery
and
defeat
in
loneliness
and
hopelessness
and
tears
he
laboured
on
he
had
no
power
to
see
how
after
many
years
when
he
was
dead
out
of
this
new
discovery
men
should
make
an
instrument
to
explore
the
farthest
stars
and
delicately
dividing
their
white
rays
divine
what
metals
in
their
beauty
burned
extort
red
secrets
from
the
heart
of
mars
or
measure
the
molten
iron
in
the
sun
he
bent
himself
to
nearer
lowlier
tasks
and
seeing
first
that
those
deflected
rays
though
it
were
only
by
the
faintest
bloom
of
colour
imperceptible
to
our
eyes
must
dim
the
vision
of
galileo
glass
he
made
his
own
new
weapon
of
the
sky
that
first
reflecting
telescope
which
should
hold
in
its
deep
mirror
as
in
a
breathless
pool
the
undistorted
image
of
a
star
iii
in
that
deep
night
where
galileo
groped
like
a
blind
giant
in
dreams
to
find
what
power
held
moons
and
planets
to
their
constant
road
through
vastness
ordered
like
a
moving
fleet
what
law
so
married
them
that
they
could
not
clash
or
sunder
but
still
kept
their
rhythmic
pace
as
if
those
ancient
tales
indeed
were
true
and
some
great
angel
helmed
each
gliding
sphere
many
had
sought
an
answer
many
had
caught
gleams
of
the
truth
and
yet
as
when
a
torch
is
waved
above
a
multitude
at
night
and
shows
wild
streams
of
faces
all
confused
but
not
the
single
law
that
knits
them
all
into
an
ordered
nation
so
our
skies
for
all
those
fragmentary
glimpses
whirled
in
chaos
till
one
soared
found
the
one
law
that
bound
them
all
in
one
and
through
that
awful
unity
upraised
the
soul
to
that
which
made
and
guides
them
all
did
newton
dreaming
in
his
orchard
there
beside
the
dreaming
witham
see
the
moon
burn
like
a
huge
gold
apple
in
the
boughs
and
wonder
why
should
moons
not
fall
like
fruit
or
did
he
see
as
those
old
tales
declare
those
that
gather
form
and
fire
till
in
one
jewel
they
pack
the
whole
bright
world
a
ripe
fruit
fall
from
some
immortal
tree
of
knowledge
while
he
wondered
at
what
height
would
this
lose
its
darkling
power
would
not
the
fruit
fall
earthward
though
it
grew
high
the
hills
as
yonder
brightening
cloud
would
not
the
selfsame
power
that
plucked
the
fruit
draw
the
white
moon
then
sailing
in
the
blue
then
in
one
flash
as
light
and
song
are
born
and
the
soul
wakes
he
saw
it
this
dark
earth
holding
the
moon
that
else
would
fly
through
space
to
her
sure
orbit
as
a
stone
is
held
in
a
whirled
sling
and
by
the
selfsame
power
her
sister
planets
guiding
all
their
moons
while
exquisitely
balanced
and
controlled
in
one
vast
system
moons
and
planets
wheeled
around
one
sovran
majesty
the
sun
iv
light
and
more
light
the
spark
from
heaven
was
there
the
flash
of
that
reintegrating
fire
flung
from
heaven
altars
where
all
light
is
born
to
feed
the
imagination
of
mankind
with
vision
and
reveal
all
worlds
in
one
but
let
no
dreamer
dream
that
his
great
work
sprang
armed
like
pallas
from
the
thunderer
brain
with
infinite
patience
he
must
test
and
prove
his
vision
now
in
those
clear
courts
of
truth
whose
absolute
laws
bemocked
by
shallower
minds
as
less
than
dreams
less
than
the
faithless
faith
that
fears
the
truth
lest
truth
should
slay
the
dream
are
man
one
guide
to
his
transcendent
heaven
for
there
no
wandering
splendour
in
the
soul
but
in
the
highest
heaven
of
all
is
one
with
absolute
reality
none
can
climb
back
to
that
fount
of
beauty
but
through
pain
long
long
he
toiled
comparing
first
the
curves
traced
by
the
as
it
soared
and
fell
with
that
great
curving
road
across
the
sky
traced
by
the
sailing
moon
was
earth
a
loadstone
holding
them
to
their
paths
by
that
dark
force
whose
mystery
men
have
cloaked
beneath
a
name
yet
when
he
came
to
test
and
prove
he
found
that
all
the
great
deflections
of
the
moon
her
shining
cadences
from
the
path
direct
were
utterly
inharmonious
with
the
law
of
that
dark
force
at
such
a
distance
acting
measured
from
earth
own
centre
for
three
long
years
newton
withheld
his
hope
until
that
day
when
light
was
brought
from
france
new
light
new
hope
in
one
small
glistening
fact
as
any
diamond
and
to
him
loaded
with
all
significance
like
the
point
of
light
that
shows
where
constellations
burn
picard
in
france
all
glory
to
her
name
who
is
herself
a
light
among
all
lands
had
measured
earth
diameter
once
more
with
exquisite
precision
to
the
throng
those
few
corrected
ciphers
his
results
were
less
than
nothing
yet
they
changed
the
world
for
newton
seized
them
and
with
trembling
hands
began
to
work
his
problem
out
anew
then
then
as
on
the
page
those
figures
turned
to
hieroglyphs
of
heaven
and
he
beheld
the
moving
moon
with
awful
cadences
falling
into
the
path
his
law
ordained
even
to
the
foot
and
second
his
hand
shook
and
dropped
the
pencil
work
it
out
for
me
he
cried
to
those
around
him
for
the
weight
of
that
celestial
music
overwhelmed
him
and
on
his
page
those
burning
hieroglyphs
were
thrones
and
principalities
and
powers
for
far
beyond
immeasurably
far
beyond
our
sun
he
saw
that
river
of
suns
we
call
the
milky
way
that
glittering
host
powdering
the
night
each
grain
of
solar
blaze
divided
from
its
neighbour
by
a
gulf
too
wide
for
thought
to
measure
each
a
sun
huger
than
ours
with
its
own
fleet
of
worlds
visible
and
invisible
those
bright
throngs
that
seemed
dispersed
like
a
defeated
host
through
blindly
wandering
skies
now
at
the
word
of
one
great
dreamer
height
height
revealed
hints
of
a
vaster
order
and
moved
on
in
boundless
intricacies
of
harmony
around
one
centre
deeper
than
all
suns
the
burning
throne
of
god
v
he
could
not
sleep
that
intellect
whose
wings
dared
the
cold
ultimate
heights
of
space
and
time
sank
like
a
wounded
eagle
with
dazed
eyes
back
headlong
through
the
clouds
to
throb
on
earth
what
shaft
had
pierced
him
that
which
also
pierced
his
great
forebears
the
hate
of
little
men
they
flocked
around
him
and
they
flung
their
dust
into
the
sensitive
eyes
and
laughed
to
see
how
dust
could
blind
them
if
one
prickling
grain
could
so
put
out
his
vision
and
so
torment
that
delicate
brain
what
weakness
how
the
mind
that
seemed
to
dwarf
us
dwindles
is
he
mad
so
buzzed
the
fools
whose
ponderous
mental
wheels
nor
dust
nor
grit
nor
stones
nor
rocks
could
irk
even
for
an
instant
newton
could
not
sleep
but
all
that
careful
malice
could
design
was
blindly
fostered
by
folly
and
great
sane
folk
like
samuel
pepys
canvassed
his
weakness
and
slept
sound
all
night
for
little
samuel
with
his
rosy
face
came
chirping
into
a
one
day
like
a
plump
robin
sir
the
unhappy
state
of
isaac
newton
grieves
me
much
last
week
i
had
a
letter
from
him
filled
with
strange
complainings
very
curious
hints
such
as
i
grieve
to
say
are
common
signs
i
have
observed
it
often
of
worse
to
come
he
said
that
he
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
because
of
all
the
embroilments
he
was
in
hinting
at
nameless
enemies
then
he
begged
my
pardon
very
strangely
i
believe
physicians
would
confirm
me
in
my
fears
is
very
sad
only
last
night
i
found
among
my
papers
certain
lines
composed
by
whom
think
my
lord
of
halifax
or
so
dear
porterhouse
assured
me
expressing
sir
the
uttermost
satisfaction
in
newton
talent
sir
he
wrote
answering
the
charge
that
science
would
put
out
the
light
of
beauty
these
very
handsome
lines
newton
walked
by
witham
stream
there
fell
no
chilling
shade
to
blight
the
drifting
naiad
dream
or
make
her
garland
fade
the
mist
of
sun
was
not
less
bright
that
crowned
urania
hair
he
robbed
it
of
its
colder
light
but
left
the
rainbow
there
they
are
very
neat
and
handsome
you
agree
solid
in
sense
as
dryden
at
his
best
and
smooth
as
waller
but
with
something
more
that
touch
of
grace
that
airier
elegance
which
only
rank
can
give
is
very
sad
that
one
so
nobly
praised
should
well
no
matter
i
am
told
sir
that
these
troubles
all
began
at
cambridge
when
his
manuscripts
were
burned
he
had
been
working
in
his
curious
way
all
through
the
night
and
in
the
morning
greyness
went
down
to
chapel
leaving
on
his
desk
a
lighted
candle
you
can
imagine
it
a
sadly
sloven
altar
to
his
muse
littered
with
papers
cups
and
greasy
plates
of
untouched
food
i
am
told
that
he
would
eat
his
monday
breakfast
sir
on
tuesday
morning
such
was
his
absent
way
when
he
returned
he
found
that
diamond
his
little
dog
named
diamond
for
a
black
patch
near
his
tail
had
overturned
the
candle
all
his
work
was
burned
to
ashes
it
struck
him
to
the
quick
though
when
his
terrier
fawned
about
his
feet
he
showed
no
anger
he
was
heard
to
say
diamond
diamond
little
do
you
know
but
from
that
hour
ah
well
we
say
no
more
halley
was
there
that
day
and
spoke
up
sharply
sir
there
are
hints
and
hints
do
you
more
i
do
sir
chirruped
samuel
mightily
pleased
to
find
all
eyes
for
once
on
his
fat
face
i
fear
his
intellects
are
disordered
sir
good
that
an
answer
i
can
deal
with
that
but
tell
me
first
quoth
halley
why
he
wrote
that
letter
a
week
ago
to
mr
pepys
why
sir
piped
samuel
innocent
of
the
trap
i
had
an
argument
in
this
last
week
with
certain
gentlemen
on
the
laws
of
chance
and
what
fair
hopes
a
man
might
have
of
throwing
six
at
dice
i
happened
to
say
that
isaac
newton
was
my
friend
and
promised
i
would
sound
him
sir
said
halley
you
pardon
me
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
heard
a
minute
since
outside
these
doors
a
very
modish
woman
of
the
town
or
else
a
most
delicious
lady
of
fashion
a
melting
creature
with
a
bold
black
eye
a
bosom
like
twin
doves
and
sir
a
mouth
like
a
turk
dream
of
paradise
she
cooed
pepys
within
i
greatly
fear
that
they
denied
you
to
her
off
ran
pepys
a
hint
a
hint
laughed
halley
and
so
to
bed
but
as
for
isaac
newton
let
me
say
whatever
his
embroilments
were
he
solved
with
just
one
hour
of
thought
not
long
ago
the
problem
set
by
leibnitz
as
a
challenge
to
all
of
europe
he
published
his
result
anonymously
but
leibnitz
when
he
saw
it
cried
out
at
once
old
enemy
as
he
was
newton
none
but
newton
from
this
claw
i
know
the
old
lion
in
his
midnight
lair
vi
isaac
newton
writes
to
vincent
at
your
letter
on
my
eightieth
birthday
wakes
memories
like
violets
in
this
london
gloom
you
have
never
failed
for
more
than
years
to
send
these
annual
greetings
from
the
haunts
where
you
and
i
were
boy
and
girl
together
a
day
must
can
not
now
be
far
when
i
shall
have
no
power
to
thank
you
for
them
so
let
me
tell
you
now
that
all
my
life
they
have
come
to
me
with
healing
in
their
wings
like
birds
from
home
birds
from
the
happy
woods
above
the
witham
where
you
walked
with
me
when
you
and
i
were
young
do
you
remember
old
barley
how
he
tried
to
teach
us
drawing
he
found
some
promise
i
believe
in
you
but
quite
despaired
of
me
i
treasure
all
those
little
sketches
that
you
sent
to
me
each
christmas
carrying
each
some
glimpse
of
home
there
one
i
love
that
shows
the
narrow
lane
behind
the
schoolhouse
where
i
had
that
bout
of
schoolboy
fisticuffs
i
have
never
known
more
pleasure
i
believe
than
when
i
beat
that
bully
and
won
for
my
reward
those
april
smiles
from
you
i
see
you
still
standing
among
the
in
the
hedge
and
just
behind
you
in
the
field
i
know
there
was
a
patch
of
aromatic
flowers
was
it
yes
their
tangled
roots
pluck
at
the
harrow
halt
the
sharp
harrow
of
thought
even
in
old
age
i
never
breathe
their
scent
but
i
am
back
in
boyhood
dreaming
there
over
some
book
among
the
diligent
bees
until
you
join
me
and
we
dream
together
they
called
me
lazy
then
oddly
enough
it
was
that
fight
that
stirred
my
mind
to
beat
my
bully
at
his
books
and
head
the
school
blind
rivalry
at
first
by
such
fond
tricks
the
invisible
power
that
shapes
us
not
ourselves
punishes
teaches
leads
us
gently
on
like
children
all
our
lives
until
we
grasp
a
sudden
meaning
and
are
born
through
death
into
full
knowledge
that
our
guide
was
love
another
picture
shows
those
woods
of
ours
around
whose
warm
dark
edges
in
the
spring
primroses
knots
of
living
sunlight
woke
and
always
you
their
radiant
shepherdess
from
elfland
lead
them
rambling
back
for
me
the
dew
still
clinging
to
their
golden
fleece
through
these
grey
another
shows
my
old
you
say
that
it
is
known
as
isaac
dial
still
i
took
great
pains
to
set
it
rightly
if
it
has
not
shifted
mark
the
time
long
after
i
am
gone
not
like
those
curious
i
made
do
you
remember
they
worked
well
at
first
but
the
least
particles
in
the
water
clogged
the
holes
through
which
it
dripped
and
so
one
day
we
two
came
home
so
late
that
we
were
sent
supperless
to
our
beds
and
suffered
much
from
the
world
harshness
as
we
thought
it
then
would
god
that
we
might
taste
that
harshness
now
i
can
not
send
you
what
you
sent
to
me
and
so
i
wish
you
never
thank
me
more
for
those
poor
gifts
i
have
sent
from
year
to
year
i
send
another
and
hope
that
you
can
use
it
to
buy
yourself
those
comforts
which
you
need
this
how
strange
it
is
to
wake
and
find
that
half
a
century
has
gone
by
with
all
our
endless
youth
they
talk
to
me
of
my
discoveries
prate
of
undying
fame
too
late
to
help
me
anything
i
achieved
was
done
through
work
and
patience
and
the
men
who
sought
quick
roads
to
glory
for
themselves
were
capable
of
neither
so
i
won
their
hatred
and
it
often
hampered
me
because
it
vexed
my
mind
this
world
of
ours
would
give
me
all
now
i
have
ceased
to
want
it
for
i
sit
here
alone
a
sad
old
man
sipping
his
nodding
to
sleep
not
caring
any
more
for
aught
they
say
not
caring
any
more
for
praise
or
blame
but
we
dreamed
of
long
ago
in
childhood
you
and
i
had
laughed
away
that
boy
and
girl
affair
we
were
too
poor
for
anything
but
laughter
i
am
old
and
you
twice
wedded
and
twice
widowed
still
retain
through
all
your
nearer
joys
and
griefs
the
old
affection
vaguely
our
blind
old
hands
grope
for
each
other
in
this
growing
dark
and
deepening
loneliness
to
say
would
that
my
words
could
tell
you
all
my
heart
but
even
my
words
grow
old
perhaps
these
lines
written
not
long
ago
may
tell
you
more
i
have
no
skill
in
verse
despite
the
praise
your
kindness
gave
me
once
but
since
i
wrote
thinking
of
you
among
the
woods
of
home
my
heart
was
in
them
let
them
turn
to
yours
me
for
friends
my
own
true
folk
who
kept
the
very
word
they
spoke
whose
quiet
prayers
from
day
to
day
have
brought
the
heavens
about
my
way
not
those
whose
intellectual
pride
would
quench
the
only
lights
that
guide
confuse
the
lines
good
and
ill
then
throne
their
own
capricious
will
not
those
whose
eyes
in
mockery
scan
the
simpler
hopes
and
dreams
of
man
not
those
keen
wits
so
quick
to
hurt
so
swift
to
trip
you
in
the
dirt
not
those
who
pluck
your
mystery
out
yet
never
saw
your
last
redoubt
whose
cleverness
would
kill
the
song
dead
at
your
heart
then
prove
you
wrong
give
me
those
eyes
i
used
to
know
where
thoughts
like
angels
come
and
go
not
glittering
eyes
nor
dimmed
by
books
but
eyes
through
which
the
deep
soul
looks
give
me
the
quiet
hands
and
face
that
never
strove
for
fame
and
place
the
soul
whose
love
so
many
a
day
has
brought
the
heavens
about
my
vii
it
a
dream
that
low
room
with
that
dark
periwigged
phantom
of
dean
swift
writing
beside
a
fire
to
one
he
loved
beautiful
catherine
barton
once
the
light
of
newton
house
and
his
child
yes
catherine
barton
i
am
brave
enough
to
face
this
pale
unhappy
wistful
ghost
of
our
departed
friendship
it
was
i
savage
and
mad
a
snarling
kennel
of
sins
your
holiness
as
you
called
me
with
that
smile
which
even
your
ghost
would
quietly
turn
on
me
who
raised
it
up
it
has
no
terrors
dear
and
i
shall
never
lay
it
while
i
live
you
write
to
me
you
think
i
have
the
power
to
shield
the
fame
of
newton
from
a
lie
poor
little
ghost
you
think
i
hold
the
keys
not
only
of
parnassus
then
but
hell
there
is
a
tale
abroad
that
newton
owed
his
public
office
to
lord
halifax
your
secret
lover
coarseness
as
you
know
is
my
peculiar
privilege
i
be
plain
and
let
them
wince
who
are
whispering
in
the
dark
they
are
hinting
that
he
gained
his
public
post
through
you
his
flesh
and
blood
and
that
he
knew
you
were
his
patron
mistress
yes
i
know
the
that
hatched
it
to
be
scotched
nay
killed
before
one
could
say
snap
had
not
one
cold
malevolent
face
been
there
listening
that
lover
of
truth
that
lucid
enemy
of
all
lies
voltaire
i
am
told
he
is
doing
much
to
spread
the
light
of
newton
great
discoveries
there
in
france
there
little
fear
that
france
whose
clear
keen
eyes
have
missed
no
morning
in
the
realm
of
thought
would
fail
to
see
it
and
smaller
need
to
lift
a
brand
from
hell
to
illume
the
light
from
heaven
you
fear
he
print
his
lie
no
doubt
of
that
i
can
foresee
the
phrase
as
halley
saw
the
advent
of
his
comet
niece
assez
amiable
then
he
give
your
name
as
adding
just
that
spice
of
infidelity
that
the
dates
admit
to
none
but
these
it
will
be
best
not
to
enlighten
him
or
he
change
his
tale
and
make
an
answer
difficult
let
him
print
this
truth
as
he
conceives
it
and
you
need
no
more
defence
all
history
then
shall
damn
his
lie
and
show
you
for
the
laughing
child
you
were
when
newton
won
his
office
for
yourself
you
say
you
have
no
fear
your
only
thought
is
that
they
soil
his
fame
ah
yes
they
try
but
they
not
hurt
it
for
all
time
to
come
it
stands
there
firm
as
marble
and
as
pure
they
can
do
nothing
that
the
sun
and
rain
will
not
erase
at
last
not
even
voltaire
can
hurt
that
noble
memory
think
of
him
as
of
a
viper
writhing
at
the
base
of
some
great
statue
let
the
venomous
tongue
flicker
against
that
marble
as
it
may
it
can
not
wound
it
i
am
far
more
grieved
for
you
who
sit
there
wondering
now
too
late
if
it
were
some
suspicion
some
dark
hint
newton
had
heard
that
robbed
him
of
his
sleep
and
almost
broke
his
mind
up
i
recall
how
the
town
buzzed
that
newton
had
gone
mad
you
copy
me
that
sad
letter
which
he
wrote
to
locke
wherein
he
begs
him
to
forgive
the
hard
words
he
had
spoken
thinking
locke
had
tried
to
embroil
him
as
he
says
with
women
a
piteous
humble
letter
had
he
heard
some
hint
of
scandal
that
he
could
not
breathe
to
you
because
he
honoured
you
too
well
i
can
not
tell
his
mind
was
greatly
troubled
with
other
things
at
least
you
need
not
fear
that
newton
thought
it
true
he
walked
aloof
treading
a
deeper
stranger
world
than
ours
have
you
not
told
me
how
he
would
forget
even
to
eat
and
drink
when
he
was
wrapt
in
those
miraculous
new
discoveries
and
under
this
wild
maze
of
shadow
and
sun
beheld
though
not
the
master
player
hand
the
keys
from
which
his
organ
music
rolls
those
visible
symphonies
of
wild
cloud
and
light
which
clothe
the
invisible
world
for
mortal
eyes
i
have
heard
that
leibnitz
whispered
to
the
court
that
newton
was
an
atheist
leibnitz
knew
his
audience
he
could
stoop
to
it
fools
have
said
that
knowledge
drives
out
wonder
from
the
world
they
say
it
still
though
all
the
dust
ablaze
with
miracles
at
their
feet
while
newton
laws
foretell
that
knowledge
one
day
shall
be
song
and
those
whom
truth
has
taken
to
her
heart
find
that
it
beats
in
music
even
this
age
has
glimmerings
of
it
newton
never
saw
his
own
full
victory
but
at
least
he
knew
that
all
the
world
was
linked
in
one
again
and
if
men
found
new
worlds
in
years
to
come
these
too
must
join
the
universal
song
that
why
true
poets
love
him
and
you
find
their
love
will
cancel
all
that
hate
can
do
they
are
the
sentinels
of
the
house
of
fame
and
that
quick
challenging
couplet
from
the
pen
of
alexander
pope
is
answer
enough
to
all
those
whisperers
round
the
outer
doors
there
addison
too
the
very
spirit
and
thought
of
newton
moved
to
music
when
he
wrote
spacious
some
age
to
come
will
say
though
newton
seldom
wrote
a
verse
that
music
was
his
own
and
speaks
his
faith
and
last
for
those
who
doubt
his
faith
in
god
and
man
immortal
destiny
there
remains
the
granite
monument
of
his
own
great
work
that
dark
cathedral
of
man
intellect
the
vast
principia
pointing
to
the
skies
wherein
our
intellectual
king
proclaimed
the
task
of
science
through
this
wilderness
of
time
and
space
and
false
appearances
to
make
the
path
straight
from
effect
to
cause
until
we
come
to
that
first
cause
of
all
the
power
above
beyond
the
blind
machine
the
primal
power
the
originating
power
which
can
not
be
mechanical
he
affirmed
it
with
absolute
certainty
whence
arises
all
this
order
this
unbroken
chain
of
law
this
human
will
this
love
whence
but
from
some
divine
transcendent
power
not
less
but
infinitely
more
than
these
because
it
is
their
fountain
and
their
guide
fools
in
their
hearts
have
said
whence
comes
this
power
why
throw
the
riddle
back
this
one
stage
more
and
newton
from
a
height
above
all
worlds
answered
and
answers
still
this
universe
exists
and
by
that
one
impossible
fact
declares
itself
a
miracle
postulates
an
infinite
power
within
itself
a
whole
greater
than
any
part
a
unity
sustaining
all
binding
all
worlds
in
one
this
is
the
mystery
palpable
here
and
now
is
not
the
lack
of
links
within
the
chain
from
cause
to
cause
but
that
the
chain
exists
that
the
unfathomable
mystery
the
one
unquestioned
miracle
that
we
implying
every
attribute
of
god
the
ultimate
absolute
omnipresent
power
in
its
own
being
deep
and
high
as
heaven
but
men
still
trace
the
greater
to
the
less
account
for
soul
with
flesh
and
dreams
with
dust
forgetting
in
their
manifold
world
the
one
in
whom
for
every
splendour
shining
here
abides
an
equal
power
behind
the
veil
was
the
eye
contrived
by
blindly
moving
atoms
or
the
ear
fulfilled
with
music
by
forces
without
knowledge
of
sweet
sounds
are
nerves
and
brain
so
sensitively
fashioned
that
they
convey
these
pictures
of
the
world
into
the
very
substance
of
our
life
while
that
from
which
we
came
the
power
that
made
us
is
drowned
in
blank
unconsciousness
of
all
does
it
not
from
the
things
we
know
appear
that
there
exists
a
being
incorporeal
living
intelligent
who
in
infinite
space
as
in
his
infinite
sensory
perceives
things
in
themselves
by
his
immediate
presence
everywhere
of
which
things
we
see
no
more
than
images
only
flashed
through
nerves
and
brain
to
our
small
sensories
what
is
all
science
then
but
pure
religion
seeking
everywhere
the
true
commandments
and
through
many
forms
the
eternal
power
that
binds
all
worlds
in
one

to
draw
near
his
maker

his
thoughts
discern
his
law
a
boundless
task
in
whose
infinitude
as
in
the
unfolding
light
and
law
of
love
abides
our
hope
and
our
eternal
joy
i
know
not
how
my
work
may
seem
to
others
so
wrote
our
mightiest
mind
but
to
myself
i
seem
a
child
that
wandering

long
upon

a
shell
and
there
a
pebble
coloured
by
the
wave
while
the
great
ocean
of
truth
from
sky
to

stretches
before
him
boundless
unexplored
he
has
explored
it
now
and
needs
of
me
neither
defence
nor
tribute
his
own
work
remains
his
monument
he
rose
at
last
so
near
the
power
divine
that
none
can
nearer
go
none
in
this
age
to
carry
on
his

for
substance
turns
to
shadow
i
shall
see
no
throngs
like
this
again
wring
no
more
praise
out
of
their
hearts
forego
that
instant
joy
let
those
who
have
not
known
it
count
it
vain
when
human
souls
at
once
respond
to
yours
here
on
the
brink
of
fortune
and
of
fame
as
men
account
these
things
the
moment
comes
when
i
must
choose
between
them
and
the
stars
and
i
have
chosen
handel
good
old
friend
we
part
hereafter
i
must
watch
that
other
wand
to
which
the
worlds
keep
time
what
has
decided
me
that
marvelous
night
when
ah
how
difficult
it
will
be
to
guide
with
all
these
wonders
whirling
through
my
brain
after
a
concert
i
came
home
out
of
the
fluttering
sea
of
fans
belles
and
periwigged
beaux
to
my
newtonian
telescope
the
design
was
his
but
more
than
half
the
joy
my
own
because
it
was
the
work
of
my
own
hand
a
new
one
with
an
eye
six
inches
wide
better
than
even
the
best
that
newton
made
then
as
i
turned
it
on
the
and
the
deep
stillness
of
those
constant
lights
castor
and
pollux
lucid
began
to
calm
the
fever
of
my
blood
i
saw
o
first
of
all
mankind
i
saw
the
disk
of
my
new
planet
gliding
there
beyond
our
tumults
in
that
realm
of
peace
what
will
they
christen
it
ach
not
no
nor
as
i
once
proposed
although
he
scarce
could
lose
it
as
he
lost
that
world
in
indeed
so
far
from
trying
to
tax
it
he
has
granted
me
how
much
two
hundred
golden
pounds
a
year
in
the
great
name
of
science
half
the
cost
of
one
with
all
those
worlds
to
win
well
well
we
must
be
grateful
this
mad
king
has
done
far
more
than
all
the
who
charge
even
this
to
madness
i
believe
one
day
he
have
me
pardoned
for
that
crime
when
i
escaped
deserted
some
would
say
from
those
in
my
native
land
deserted
drill
for
music
as
i
now
desert
my
music
for
the
orchestral
spheres
no
this
new
planet
is
only
new
to
man
his
majesty
has
done
much
yet
as
my
friend
declared
last
night
never
did
monarch
buy
honour
so
cheaply
and
he
has
not
bought
it
i
think
that
it
should
bear
some
ancient
name
and
wear
it
like
a
crown
some
deep
dark
name
like
known
to
remoter
gods
how
strange
it
seems
this
buzzing
there
doctor
burney
bowing
and
behind
him
his
daughter
fanny
is
it
a
dream
these
crowding
midgets
dense
as
clustering
bees
in
some
great
now
as
i
lift
my
wand
a
silence
grips
them
and
the
strings
begin
throbbing
the
faint
lights
flicker
in
gusts
of
sound
before
me
glimmering
like
a
crescent
moon
the
dim
half
circle
of
the
choir
awaits
its
own
appointed
time
beside
me
now
watching
my
wand
plump
and
immaculate
from
buckled
shoes
to
that
white
bunch
of
lace
under
his
chin
the
midget
tenor
rises
music
in
hand
a
linnet
and
a
king
the
bullfinch
bass
that
other
emperor
leans
back
indifferently
and
clears
his
throat
as
if
to
say
this
prelude
leads
to
while
on
their
own
proud
thrones
on
either
hand
the
sumptuously
bosomed
midget
queens
contralto
and
soprano
jealously
eye
each
other
plumage
round
me
the
music
throbs
with
an
immortal
passion
i
grow
aware
of
an
appalling
mystery
we
this
throng
of
midgets
playing
listening
tense
and
still
are
sailing
on
a
midget
ball
of
dust
we
call
our
planet
will
have
sailed
through
space
ten
thousand
leagues
before
this
music
ends
what
does
it
mean
oh
god
what
it
mean
this
weird
hushed
with
a
thousand
eyes
these
midget
periwigs
all
those
little
blurs
tier
over
tier
of
faces
masks
of
flesh
corruptible
hiding
each
its
hopes
and
dreams
its
dreams
and
all
this
throng
will
be
forgotten
mixed
with
dust
crushed
out
before
this
book
of
music
is
outworn
or
that
tall
organ
crumbles
violins
outlast
their
players
other
hands
may
touch
that
harpsichord
but
ere
this
planet
makes
another
threescore
journeys
round
its
sun
these
breathing
listeners
will
have
vanished
whither
i
watch
my
moving
hands
and
they
grow
strange
what
is
it
moves
this
body
what
am
i
how
came
i
here
a
ghost
to
hear
that
voice
of
infinite
compassion
far
away
above
the
throbbing
strings
hark
if
music
lead
us
to
a
cry
like
this
i
think
i
shall
not
lose
it
in
the
skies
i
do
but
follow
its
own
secret
law
as
long
ago
i
sought
to
understand
its
golden
mathematics
taught
myself
the
way
to
lay
one
stone
upon
another
before
i
dared
to
dream
that
i
might
build
my
holy
city
of
song
i
gave
myself
to
all
its
branches
how
they
stared
at
me
those
men
of
sensibility
when
i
said
that
algebra
conic
sections
fluxions
all
pertained
to
music
let
them
stare
again
old
kepler
knew
by
instinct
what
i
now
desire
to
learn
i
have
resolved
to
leave
no
tract
of
heaven
unvisited
the
music
carries
me
back
to
it
again
i
see
beyond
this
island
universe
beyond
our
sun
and
all
those
other
suns
that
throng
the
milky
way
far
far
beyond
a
thousand
little
wisps
faint
nebulae
luminous
fans
and
milky
streaks
of
fire
some
like
soft
brushes
of
electric
mist
streaming
from
one
bright
point
others
that
spread
and
branch
like
growing
systems
others
discrete
keen
ripe
with
stars
in
clusters
others
drawn
back
by
central
forces
into
one
dense
death
thence
to
be
kindled
into
fire
reborn
and
scattered
abroad
once
more
in
a
delicate
spray
faint
as
the
mist
by
one
bright
dewdrop
breathed
at
dawn
and
yet
a
universe
like
our
own
each
wisp
a
universe
a
vast
galaxy
wide
as
our
night
of
stars
the
milky
way
in
which
our
sun
is
drowned
to
these
would
seem
less
than
to
us
their
faintest
drift
of
haze
yet
we
who
are
borne
on
one
dark
grain
of
dust
around
one
indistinguishable
spark
of
lost
in
one
lost
feather
of
light
can
by
the
strength
of
our
own
thought
ascend
through
universe
after
universe
trace
their
growth
through
boundless
time
their
glory
their
decay
and
on
the
invisible
road
of
law
more
firm
than
granite
range
through
all
their
length
and
breadth
their
height
and
depth
past
present
and
to
come
so
those
who
follow
the
great
law
from
small
things
up
to
great
may
one
day
learn
the
structure
of
the
heavens
discern
the
whole
within
the
part
as
men
through
love
see
god
oh
holy
night
deep
night
of
stars
whose
peace
descends
upon
the
troubled
mind
like
dew
healing
it
with
the
sense
of
that
pure
reign
of
constant
law
enduring
through
all
change
shall
i
not
one
day
after
faithful
years
find
that
thy
heavens
are
built
on
music
too
and
hear
once
more
above
thy
throbbing
worlds
this
voice
of
all
compassion
ye
yes
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
vii
sir
john
herschel
remembers
true
type
of
all
from
his
own
father
hand
he
caught
the
fire
and
though
he
carried
it
far
into
new
regions
and
from
southern
fields
of
yellow
lupin
added
host
on
host
to
those
bright
armies
which
his
father
knew
surely
the
crowning
hour
of
all
his
life
was
when
his
task
accomplished
he
returned
a
lonely
pilgrim
to
the
twilit
shrine
of
first
beginnings
and
his
father
youth
there
in
the
octagon
chapel
with
bared
head
grey
honoured
for
his
father
and
himself
he
touched
the
glimmering
keyboard
touched
the
books
those
dear
lost
hands
had
touched
so
long
ago
strange
that
these
poor
inanimate
things
outlast
the
life
that
used
them
yes
i
should
like
to
try
this
good
old
friend
of
his
you
leave
me
here
an
hour
or
so
his
hands
explored
the
stops
and
while
the
music
breathed
what
else
were
mute
his
mind
through
many
thoughts
and
memories
ranged
picture
on
picture
passed
before
him
there
in
living
colours
painted
on
the
gloom
not
what
the
world
acclaimed
the
great
work
crowned
but
all
that
went
before
the
years
of
toil
the
years
of
infinite
patience
hope
despair
he
saw
the
little
house
where
all
began
his
father
first
resolve
to
explore
the
sky
his
first
defeat
when
telescopes
were
found
too
costly
for
a
purse
and
then
that
dogged
and
will
declaring
be
it
so
i
make
my
own
a
better
than
even
the
best
that
newton
made
he
saw
his
first
rude
telescope
a
tube
of
pasteboard
with
a
lens
at
either
end
and
then
that
arduous
growth
to
size
and
power
with
each
new
instrument
as
his
knowledge
grew
and
to
reward
each
growth
a
deeper
heaven
he
saw
the
good
aunt
caroline
dismay
when
her
trim
as
by
wizardry
turned
into
a
workshop
where
her
brother
hands
cut
ground
and
burnished
hour
on
aching
hour
month
after
month
new
mirrors
of
the
sky
yet
while
from
dawn
to
dark
her
brother
moved
around
some
mirror
burnishing
it
knowing
that
if
he
once
removed
his
hands
the
surface
would
be
dimmed
and
must
forego
its
heaven
for
ever
her
quiet
hands
would
raise
food
to
his
lips
or
with
that
musical
voice
which
once
for
she
too
offered
her
sacrifice
had
promised
her
fame
she
whiled
away
the
hours
reading
how
long
ago
aladdin
raised
the
djinns
by
burnishing
that
old
battered
lamp
or
from
cervantes
how
one
crazy
soul
tilting
at
windmills
challenged
a
purblind
world
he
saw
her
seized
at
last
by
that
same
fire
burning
to
help
a
sleepless
vestal
dowered
with
rushing
from
desk
to
clock
or
measuring
distances
at
dead
of
night
between
the
and
his
eyes
he
saw
her
in
hurrying
out
a
slim
shawled
figure
through
the
drifted
snow
to
help
him
saw
her
fall
with
a
stifled
cry
gashing
herself
upon
that
buried
hook
and
struggling
up
out
of
the
drift
to
greet
him
with
a
smile
for
any
soldier
this
wound
the
surgeon
muttered
would
have
meant
six
weeks
in
hospital
not
six
days
for
her
i
am
glad
these
nights
were
cloudy
and
we
lost
so
little
was
all
she
said
sir
john
pulled
out
another
stop
a
little
ironical
march
of
flutes
began
to
through
the
gloom
he
saw
that
first
success
ay
call
it
so
the
royal
command
the
court
desires
to
see
the
planet
saturn
and
his
marvellous
rings
on
friday
night
the
skies
on
friday
night
were
black
with
clouds
canute
me
no
canutes
muttered
their
new
magician
and
unpacked
his
telescope
you
shall
see
what
you
can
see
he
levelled
it
through
a
window
and
they
saw
wonderful
marvellous
glorious
eh
what
what
a
planet
of
paper
with
a
paper
ring
lit
by
a
lamp
in
a
hollow
of
windsor
park
among
the
ferns
where
herne
the
hunter
walks
and
falstaff
found
that
fairies
live
on
cheese
thus
all
were
satisfied
while
above
the
clouds
the
thunder
of
the
pedals
reaffirmed
the
titan
planet
every
minute
rolled
three
hundred
leagues
upon
his
awful
way
then
through
that
night
the
with
deeper
longing
than
lucretius
knew
when
in
his
great
third
book
the
somber
chant
kindled
and
soared
on
those
exultant
wings
praising
the
master
hand
from
which
he
too
father
discoverer
hero
caught
the
fire
it
spoke
of
those
vast
labours
incomplete
but
through
their
incompletion
infinite
in
beauty
and
in
hope
the
task
bequeathed
from
dying
hand
to
hand
close
to
his
grave
like
a
stood
the
hulk
of
that
great
weapon
rusted
and
outworn
which
once
broke
down
the
barriers
of
the
sky
perrupit
claustra
yes
and
bridged
their
gulfs
for
far
beyond
our
solar
scheme
it
showed
the
law
that
bound
our
planets
binding
still
those
coupled
suns
which
year
by
year
he
watched
around
each
other
circling
had
our
own
some
distant
comrade
lost
among
the
stars
should
we
not
one
day
just
as
kepler
drew
his
planetary
music
and
its
laws
from
all
those
faithful
records
tycho
made
discern
at
last
what
vaster
music
rules
the
vaster
drift
of
stars
from
deep
to
deep
around
what
awful
poles
those
wisps
of
light
those
fifteen
hundred
universes
move
one
signal
even
now
across
the
dark
declared
their
worlds
confederate
with
our
own
for
carrying
many
secrets
which
we
now
slowly
decipher
one
swift
messenger
comes
across
the
abyss
the
light
that
flashing
through
the
immeasurable
from
universe
to
universe
proclaims
the
single
reign
of
law
that
binds
them
all
we
shall
break
up
those
rays
and
in
their
lines
and
colours
read
the
history
of
their
stars
year
after
year
the
slow
sure
records
grow
awaiting
their
interpreter
they
shall
see
it
our
sons
in
that
far
day
the
swift
the
strong
the
triumphing
runners
with
the
torch
no
in
space
or
time
shall
halt
or
daunt
them
who
that
once
has
seen
how
truth
leads
on
to
truth
shall
ever
dare
to
set
a
bound
to
knowledge
would
that
he
knew
so
thought
the
visitant
at
that
shadowy
shrine
even
as
the
maker
of
a
song
can
hear
with
the
soul
ear
far
off
the
unstricken
chords
to
which
by
its
own
inner
law
it
climbs
would
that
my
father
knew
how
younger
hands
completed
his
own
planetary
tune
how
from
the
planet
that
his
own
eyes
found
the
mind
of
man
would
plunge
into
the
dark
and
blindfold
find
without
the
help
of
eyes
a
mightier
planet
in
the
depths
beyond
then
while
the
reeds
with
quiet
melodious
pace
followed
the
dream
as
in
a
picture
passed
adams
the
boy
at
cambridge
making
his
vow
by
that
still
lamp
alone
in
that
deep
night
beneath
the
crumbling
battlements
of
john
to
know
why
uranus
uttermost
planet
known
moved
in
a
rhythm
delicately
astray
from
all
the
golden
harmonies
ordained
by
those
known
measures
of
its
was
there
an
unknown
planet
far
beyond
sailing
through
unimaginable
deeps
and
drawing
it
from
its
path
then
challenging
chords
echoed
the
prophecy
that
sir
john
had
made
guided
by
his
own
faith
in
newton
law
have
not
found
it
but
we
feel
it
trembling
along
the
lines
of
our
analysis
now
as
once
columbus
from
the
shores
of
spain
felt
the
new
then
in
swift
fugues
began
a
race
between
two
nations
for
the
prize
of
that
new
world
le
verrier
in
france
adams
in
england
each
of
them
unaware
of
his
own
rival
at
the
selfsame
hour
resolved
to
find
it
not
by
the
telescope
now
skies
might
be
swept
for
aeons
ere
one
spark
among
those
myriads
were
both
found
and
seen
to
move
at
that
vast
distance
round
our
sun
they
worked
by
faith
in
law
alone
they
knew
the
wanderings
of
great
uranus
and
they
knew
the
law
of
newton
by
the
midnight
lamp
pencil
in
hand
shut
in
a
room
each
by
pure
thought
must
work
his
problem
out
given
that
law
to
find
the
mass
and
place
of
that
which
drew
their
planet
from
his
course
there
were
no
throngs
to
applaud
them
each
alone
without
the
heat
of
conflict
laboured
on
consuming
brain
and
nerve
for
throngs
applaud
only
the
flash
and
tinsel
of
their
day
never
the
quiet
runners
with
the
torch
night
after
night
they
laboured
line
on
line
of
intricate
figures
moving
all
in
law
they
marshalled
their
long
columns
formed
and
marched
from
battle
to
battle
and
no
sound
was
heard
of
victory
or
defeat
they
marched
through
snows
bleak
as
the
drifts
that
broke
napoleon
pride
and
through
a
vaster
desert
they
drilled
their
hosts
with
that
divine
precision
of
the
mind
to
which
one
second
error
in
a
year
were
anarchy
that
precision
which
is
felt
throbbing
through
music
month
on
month
they
toiled
with
worlds
for
ciphers
one
rich
autumn
night
brooding
over
his
figures
there
alone
in
cambridge
adams
found
them
moving
all
to
one
solution
to
the
unseeing
eye
his
long
neat
pages
had
no
more
to
tell
than
any

another

an

it

through

since

sailed

more
than

since
galileo
he
took
his

sweep
the

now
he
said
you

not

in

he
left
his

airy
king

looked
askance
at
unofficial

in

that
music
of

nine

he
waited

whoever

most
of

honour
to

who
found
the

that

a

to

newton
the
first
whose

could
soar
beyond

and
declare
thus
saith
the

nature
and
of
god
concerning
things
invisible
this

world
what
was
it
but
one
harmony
the
more
in
that
great
music
which
himself
had
heard
the
chant
of
those
reintegrated
spheres
moving
around
their
sun
while
all
things
moved
around
one
deeper
light
revealed
by
law
beyond
all
vision
past
all
understanding
yet
darkly
shadowed
forth
for
dreaming
men
on
earth
in
music
music
all
comes
back
to
music
in
the
end
then
in
the
gloom
of
the
octagon
chapel
the
dreamer
lifted
up
his
face
as
if
to
all
those
great
forebears
the
quivering
organ
rolled
upon
the
dusk
his
dream
of
that
new
symphony
the
sun
chanting
to
all
his
planets
on
their
way
while
stop

replying
height
height
his

answered
voices
of
a
dream
the

on
the

faint

that
attend
me
light
but
for
fury
and
the
fire
my
maelstroms
the
red
storms
that
rend
me
can
yield
them
still
the
harvest
they
desire
i
kiss
with
light
their
faces
with
flowers
i
crown
their
dusky
brows
they
praise
me
lightly
from
their
pleasant
places
their
birds
belaud
me
lightly
from
their
boughs
and
men
on
lute
and
lyre
have
breathed
their
pleasure
they
have
watched
apollo
golden
chariot
roll
hymned
his
bright
wheels
but
never
mine
that
measure
a
million
leagues
of
flame
from
pole
to

like
the
stars
grow
wide
before
me
i
draw
my
worlds
ten
thousand
leagues
a
day
their
far
blue
seas
like
april
eyes
adore
me
they
follow
dreaming
on
my
soundless
way
how
should
they
know
who
wheel
around
my
burning
what
torments
bore
them
or
what
power
am
i
i
that
with
all
those
worlds
around
me
turning
sail
every

from

to
unplumbed

my

these
live
embers
of
my

these
children
of
my
hurricanes
of

flung
thro
the
night
for
midnight
to
refashion
praise
and
forget
the
splendour
whence
they
came

it
a
dream
that
in
those
bright
dominions
are
other

that
sing
with
lives
like
mine
lives

with
beating
hearts

broken
pinions
aspire
and
fall
a
grain
of
dust
among
those
glittering
legions
am
i

touched
with
joy

silver

once
again
your

a

new

wreathe
with
mist
my

now
to
praise
their

a

assembles
whose

no

ten

flung
thro

for

to
refashion
praise

the
splendour
whence
we
epilogue
once
more
upon
the
mountain
lonely
height
i
woke
and
round
me
heard
the
sound
of
as
the
solemn
washed
through
the
long
canyons
and
precipitous
gorges
where
coyotes
moaned
and
eagles
made
their
nest
once
more
far
far
below
i
saw
the
lights
of
distant
cities
at
the
mountain
feet
clustered
like
over
me
like
the
dome
of
some
strange
shrine
housing
our
great
new
weapon
of
the
sky
and
moving
on
its
axis
like
a
moon
glimmered
the
new
uraniborg
shadows
passed
like
monks
between
it
and
the
low
grey
walls
that
lodged
them
like
a
fortress
in
the
rocks
their
monastery
of
thought
a
shadow
neared
me
i
heard
once
more
an
eager
living
voice
year
after
year
the
slow
sure
records
grow
i
wish
that
old
copernicus
could
see
how
through
his
truth
that
once
dispelled
a
dream
broke
the
false
of
heaven
destroyed
all
central
certainty
in
the
universe
and
seemed
to
dwarf
mankind
the
spirit
of
man
laid
hold
on
law
that
of
light
and
mounting
slowly
surely
step
by
step
entered
into
its
kingdom
and
its
power
for
just
as
tycho
tables
of
the
stars
within
the
bound
of
our
own
galaxy
led
kepler
to
the
music
of
his
laws
so
father
and
son
the
herschels
with
their
charts
of
all
those
those
faint
nebulae
those
hosts
of
drifting
universes
led
our
new
discoverers
to
yet
mightier
laws
enthroned
above
all
worlds
we
have
not
found
them
and
yet
only
the
intellectual
fool
dreams
in
his
heart
that
even
his
brain
can
tick
in
isolated
measure
a
centre
of
law
amidst
the
whirl
of
universal
chaos
for
law
descends
from
law
though
all
the
spheres
through
all
the
abysmal
depths
of
space
were
blown
like
dust
before
a
colder
darker
wind
than
even
lucretius
dreamed
yet
if
one
thought
one
gleam
of
law
within
the
mind
of
man
lighten
our
darkness
there
a
law
beyond
and
even
that
tempest
of
destruction
moves
to
a
lighter
music
shatters
its
myriad
worlds
only
to
gather
them
up
as
a
shattered
wave
is
gathered
again
into
a
rhythmic
sea
whose
ebb
and
flow
are
but
the
pulse
of
life
in
its
creative
passion
the
records
grow
unceasingly
and
each
new
grain
of
truth
is
packed
like
radium
with
whole
worlds
of
light
the
eclipses
timed
in
babylon
help
us
now
to
clock
that
gradual
quickening
of
the
moon
ten
seconds
in
a
century
who
that
wrote
on
those
clay
tablets
could
foresee
his
gift
to
future
ages
dreamed
that
the
groping
mind
dowered
with
so
brief
a
life
could
ever
range
with
that
divine
precision
through
the
abyss
who
when
that
good
dutch
set
two
lenses
in
a
tube
to
read
the
time
upon
the
distant
of
his
church
could
dream
of
this
our
that
shows
the
snow
upon
the
polar
caps
of
mars
whitening
and
darkening
as
the
seasons
change
or
who
could
dream
when
galileo
watched
his
moons
of
jupiter
that
from
their
eclipses
and
from
that
change
in
their
appointed
times
now
late
now
early
as
the
watching
earth
farther
or
nearer
on
its
orbit
rolled
the
immeasurable
speed
of
light
at
last
should
be
reduced
to
measure
could
newton
dream
when
through
his
prism
he
broke
the
pure
white
shaft
into
that
rainbow
band
how
men
should
gather
and
disentangle
ray
by
delicate
ray
the
colours
of
the
stars
not
only
those
that
burn
in
heaven
but
those
that
long
since
perished
those
vanished
suns
that
eyes
can
still
behold
the
strange
lost
stars
whose
light
still
reaches
earth
although
they
died
ten
thousand
years
ago
here
night
by
night
the
innumerable
heavens
speak
to
an
eye
more
sensitive
than
man
write
on
the
camera
delicate
retina
a
thousand
messages
lines
of
dark
and
bright
that
speak
of
elements
unknown
on
earth
how
shall
men
doubt
who
thus
can
read
the
book
of
judgment
and
transcend
both
space
and
time
analyse
worlds
that
long
since
passed
away
and
scan
the
future
how
shall
they
doubt
his
power
from
whom
their
power
and
all
creation
came
i
think
that
when
the
second
herschel
tried
those
great
hexameters
in
our
english
tongue
a
nobler
shield
than
ever
achilles
knew
shone
through
the
song
and
made
his
echoes
live
there
he
depicted
the
earth
and
the
canopied
sky
and
the
there
the
unwearied
sun
and
the
moon
in
their
courses
all
the
configured
stars
that
gem
the
circuit
of
heaven
pleiads
and
hyads
were
there
and
the
giant
force
of
orion
there
the
revolving
bear
which
the
wain
they
call
was
ensculptured
circling
on
high
and
in
all
his
courses
regarding
orion
sole
of
the
starry
train
that
descends
not
to
bathe
in
the
ocean
a
nobler
shield
for
us
a
deeper
sky
but
even
to
us
who
know
how
far
away
those
constellations
burn
the
wonder
bides
that
each
vast
sun
can
speed
through
the
abyss
age
after
age
more
swiftly
than
an
eagle
each
on
its
different
road
alone
like
ours
with
its
own
satellites
yet
since
homer
sang
their
aspect
has
not
altered
all
their
flight
has
not
yet
changed
the
old
pattern
of
the
wain
the
of
orion
is
not
sundered
nor
has
one
fugitive
splendour
broken
yet
from
cassiopeia
throne
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
yesterday
even
unto
these
how
shall
men
doubt
his
empery
over
time
whose
dwelling
is
a
deep
so
absolute
that
we
can
only
find
him
in
our
souls
for
there
despite
copernicus
each
may
find
the
centre
of
all
things
there
he
lives
and
reigns
there
infinite
distance
into
nearness
grows
and
infinite
majesty
stoops
to
dust
again
all
things
in
little
infinite
love
in
man
oh
beating
wings
descend
to
earth
once
more
and
hear
reborn
the
desert
singer
cry
i
consider
the
heavens
the
work
of
thy
fingers
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
which
thou
hast
ordained
though
man
be
as
dust
i
know
thou
art
mindful
of
him
and
through
thy
law
thy
light
still
visiteth
the
end
