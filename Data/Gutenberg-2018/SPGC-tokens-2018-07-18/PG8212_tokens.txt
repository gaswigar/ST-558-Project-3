many

sad
yet
soothing
lay
beguil
my
wandering
with
the
charms
of
song
lonely
my
heart
and
rugged
was
my
way
yet
often
pluck
i
as
i
past

the
wild
and
simple
flowers
of
poesy
and
as
beseem

wayward
fancy
child
entwin
each
random
weed
that
pleas
mine
eye
accept
the
wreath
beloved
it
is
wild
and
rudely
garlanded
yet
scorn
not
thou
the
humble
offering
where
the
sad
rue
weaves
gayer
flowers
its
intermingled
leaves
and
i
have
twin
the
myrtle
for
thy
brow
i
have
collected
in
this
volume
the
productions
of
very
distant
periods
the
lyric
pieces
were
written
in
earlier
youth
i
now
think
the
ode
the
most
worthless
species
of
composition
as
well
as
the
most
difficult
and
should
never
again
attempt
it
even
if
my
future
pursuits
were
such
as
allowed
leisure
for
poetry
the
poems
addressed
to
the
heart
and
the
understanding
are
those
of
my
maturer
judgment
the
inscriptions
will
be
found
to
differ
from
the
greek
simplicity
of
akenside
in
the
point
that
generally
concludes
them
the
sonnets
were
written
first
or
i
would
have
adopted
a
different
title
and
avoided
the
shackle
of
rhyme

the
triumph
of
woman
glad
as
the
weary
traveller
to
reach
secure
at
length
his
native
coast
who
wandering
long
distant
lands
has
sped
the
wildly
howling
round
his
head
known
all
the
woes
of
want
and
felt
the
storm
of
the
bleak
winter
parch
his
shivering
form
the
journey
and
every
peril
past
beholds
his
little
at
last
and
as
he
sees
afar
the
smoke
curl
slow
feels
his
full
eyes
with
transport
overflow
so
from
the
scene
where
death
and
anguish
reign
and
vice
and
folly
drench
with
blood
the
plain
joyful
i
turn

sing

of
woe

hills

train
from
where
orontes
foams
along

from
where

with
the
toilsome
pleasures
of
the
day
without
judaea
watchful
sons
await
to
guard
the
sleeping
pageant
of

three
youths
were
these
of

three

as
he
spake
and
guarded
whilst
he
slept
yet
oft
for
salem
hallowed
towers
laid
low
the
sigh
would
heave
the
unbidden
tear
would
flow
and
when
the
dull
and
wearying
round
of
power
allowed
zorobabel
one
vacant
hour
he
lov
on
babylon
high
wall
to
roam
and
stretch
the
gaze
towards
his
distant
home
or
on
euphrates
willowy
banks
hear
the
sad
harp
moan
fitful
to
the
wind
as
now
the
perfum
lamps
stream
wide
their
light
and
social
converse
chears
the
livelong
night
thus
spake
zorobabel
too
long
in
vain
for
sion
desolate
her
sons
complain
in
anguish
worn
the
joyless
years
lag
slow
and
these
proud
conquerors
mock
their
captive
woe
whilst
cyrus
triumph
here
in

brighter
prospect
chear
our
exil
fate

sacred
walls
again
he
bade
us
raise
and
to
jehovah
rear
the
pile
of
praise
quickly
these
fond
hopes
faded
from
our
eyes
as
the
frail
sun
that
gilds
the
wintry
skies
and
spreads
a
moment
radiance
the
plain
soon
hid
by
clouds
that
dim
the
scene
again
opprest
by
artaxerxes
jealous
reign
we
vainly
pleaded
here
and
wept
in
vain
now
when
darius
chief
of
mild
command
bids
joy
and
pleasure
fill
the
festive
land
still
shall
we
droop
the
head
in
sullen
grief
and
sternly
silent
shun
to
seek
relief
what
if
amid
the
monarch
mirthful
throng
our
harps
should
echo
to
the
chearful
song
fair
is
the
occasion
thus
the
one
replied
and
now
let
all
our
tuneful
skill
be
tried
whilst

gay
courtiers
quaff

smiling
bowl
and
wine
strong
fumes

the
madden
soul
where
all
around
is
merriment

mine
to
strike
the
lute
and
praise

power

and
whilst

friend
replied
in

faultless
form

bends
loves

bids
the

call

to
grace
the
thronging
hall
hush
is
each
sound
the
attending
crowd
are
mute
the
hebrew
lightly
strikes
the
chearful
lute
when
the
traveller
on
his
way
who
has
toil
the
livelong
day
feels
around
on
every
side
the
chilly
mists
of
eventide
fatigued
and
faint
his
wearied
mind
recurs
to
all
he
leaves
behind
he
thinks
upon
the
hearth
the
evening
hour
of
social
mirth
and
her
who
at
departing
day
weeps
for
her
husband
far
away
oh
give
to
him
the
flowing
bowl
bid
it
renovate
his
soul
then
shall
sorrow
sink
to
sleep
and
he
who
wept
no
more
shall
weep
for
his
brow
shall
clear
and
his
glad
eye
shall
sparkle
thro
the
tear
when
the
poor
man
betakes
him
to
his
evening
rest
and
worn
with
labour
thinks
in
sorrow
of
the
labor
of
when
sadly
musing
on
his
lot
he
hies
him
to
his
joyless
cot
and
loathes
to
meet
his
children
there
the
rivals
for
his
scanty
fare
oh
give
to
him
the
flowing
bowl
bid
it
renovate
his
soul
the
generous
juice
with
magic
power
shall
cheat
with
happiness
the
hour
and
with
each
warm
affection
fill
the
heart
by
want
and
wretchedness
made
chill
when
at
the
dim
close
of
day
the
captive
loves
alone
to
stray
along
the
haunts
recluse
and
rude
of
sorrow
and
of
solitude
when
he
sits
with
moveless
eye
to
mark
the
lingering
radiance
die
and
lets
distemper
fancy
roam
amid
the
ruins
of
his
home
oh
give
to
him
the
flowing
bowl
bid
it
renovate
his
soul
the
bowl
shall
better
thoughts
bestow
and
lull
to
rest
his
wakeful
woe
and
joy
shall
bless
the
evening
hour
and
make
the
captive
fortune
conqueror
when
the
wearying
cares
of
state
oppress
the
monarch
with
their
weight
when
from
his
pomp
retir
alone
he
feels
the
duties
of
the
throne
feels
that
the
multitude
below
depend
on
him
for
weal
or
woe
when
his
powerful
will
may
bless
a
realm
with
peace
and
happiness
or
with
desolating
breath
breathe
ruin
round
and
woe
and
death
oh
give
to
him
the
flowing
bowl
bid
it
humanize
his
soul
he
shall
not
feel
the
empire
weight
he
shall
not
feel
the
cares
of
state
the
bowl
shall
each
dark
thought
beguile
and
nations
live
and
prosper
from
his
smile
husht
was
the
lute

hebrew
ceas
the
song
long
peals
of
plaudits
echoed
from
the
throng
each
tongue
the
liberal
words
of
praise
repaid
on
every
cheek
a
smile
applauding
play
the
rival
bard
advanced
he
struck
the
string
and
pour
the
loftier
song
to
persia
king
why
should
the
wearying
cares
of
state
oppress
the
monarch
with
their
weight
alike
to
him
if
peace
shall
bless
the
multitude
with
happiness
alike
to
him
if
frenzied
war
careers
triumphant
on
the
embattled
plain
and
rolling
on
myriads
slain
with
gore
and
wounds
shall
clog
his
scythed
car
what
tho
the
tempest
rage
no
sound
of
the
deep
thunder
shakes
his
distant
throne
and
the
red
flash
that
spreads
destruction
round
reflects
a
glorious
splendour
on
the
crown
where
is
the
man
who
with
ennobling
pride
beholds
not
his
own
nature
where
is
he
who
but
with
deep
amazement
awe
allied
must
muse
the
mysteries
of
the
human
mind
the
miniature

why
goes
the
peasant
from

peace
and
love

blest
his
humble
life
in

i

innocent

this

see
ye
to

preface
when
first
the
abolition
of
the
was
agitated
in
england
the
friends
of
humanity
endeavoured
by
two
means
to
accomplish
to
destroy
the
trade
immediately
by
the
interference
of
government
or
by
the
disuse
of
productions
a
slow
but
certain
method
for
a
while
government
held
the
language
of
justice
and
individuals
with
enthusiasm
banished
sugar
from
their
tables
this
enthusiasm
soon
cooled
the
majority
of
those
who
had
made
this
sacrifice
i
prostitute
the
word
but
they
thought
it
a
sacrifice
persuaded
themselves
that
parliament
would
do
all
and
that
individual
efforts
were
no
longer
necessary
thus
ended
the
one
attempt
and
the
duplicity
with
which
wilberforce
has
been
amused
and
the
satisfied
has
now
effectually
destroyed
the
other
there
are
yet
two
other
methods
remaining
by
which
this
traffic
will
probably
be
abolished
by
the
introduction
of
or
maple
sugar
or
by
the
just
and
general
rebellion
of
the
negroes
by
the
vindictive
justice
of
the
africans
or
by
the
civilized
christians
finding
it
their
interest
to
be
humane
to
these
past
and
present
prospects
the
following
poems
occasionally
allude
to
the
english
custom
of
exciting
wars
upon
the
slave
coast
that
they
may
purchase
prisoners
and
to
the
punishment
sometimes
inflicted
upon

negro

smooth

once
so

prized
this

loved
it
for
its

some
are
gone
to
their
last
home
and
some
estranged
in
heart
beholding
me
with
glance
pass
on
the
other
side
but
still
these
hues
remain
unalter
and
these
features
wear
the
look
of
infancy
and
innocence
i
search
myself
in
vain
and
find
no
trace
of
what
i
was
those
lines
dark
and
now
and
that
mild
face
settled
in
these
strong
lineaments
there
were
who
form
high
hopes
and
flattering
ones
of
thee
young
robert

thine

was

to
speak
each
opening
feeling

they
not

cloud
reflects
its
radiant
dies
the

beholds
the
ominous
glory
sad
and
fears
impending
storms
they
augur
happily
for
thou
didst
love
each
wild
and
wonderous
tale
of
faery
fiction
and
thine
infant
tongue
lisp
with
delight
the
godlike
deeds
of
greece
and
rising
rome
therefore
they
deem
forsooth
that
thou
shouldst
tread
preferment
pleasant
path
ones
they
let
thy
little
feet
stray
in
the
pleasant
paths
of
poesy
and
when
thou
shouldst
have
prest
amid
the
crowd
there
didst
thou
love
to
linger
out
the
day
loitering
beneath
the
laurels
barren
shade

this

it

the

not

aching
eye
for

drop
a

and
dwell
upon
the
dead
poor
wretched

thee

humanity
yes
i
will
weep

not
that
thou
art
come
to
the

as
the

ill
hour

swiftly
with
my

the
girls
were
wonderous
kind
and
wonderous
fair
they
soon
transferred
me
to
the
doctor
care
the
doctor
undertook
to
cure
the
evil
and
he
almost
transferred
me
to
the
devil

story
of
fighting
fasting
wretchedness
and
glory
at
last
discharg
to

without

sam
at
dinner
samuel
i
was
trapp
by
the
serjeant
palavering
pretences
he
listed
me
when
i
was
out
of
my
senses
so
i
took
leave
of
all
care
and
all
sorrow
and
was
drill
to
repentance
and
reason
john
i
would
be
a
sailor
and
plough
the
wide
ocean
and
was
soon
sick
and
sad
with
the
billow
commotion
so
the
captain
he
sent
me
aloft
on
the
mast
and
curs
me
and
bid
me
cry
there
and
hold
fast
samuel
after
marching
all
day
faint
and
hungry
and
sore
i
have
lain
down
at
night
on
the
swamps
of
the
moor
unshelter
and
forced
by
fatigue
to
remain
all
chill
by
the
wind
and
benumb
by
the
rain
john
i
have
rode
out
the
storm
when
the
billows
beat
high
and
the
red
gleaming
lightnings
flash
thro
the
dark
sky
when
the
tempest
of
night
the
black
sea
overcast
wet
and
weary
i
labour
yet
sung
to
the
blast
samuel
i
have
march
trumpets
sounding
drums
beating
flags
flying
where
the
music
of
war
drown
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
when
the
shots
whizz
around
me
all
dangers
defied
push
on
when
my
comrades
fell
dead
at
my
side
drove
the
foe
from
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
away
fought
conquer
and
bled
all
for
sixpence
a
day
john
and
i
too
friend
samuel
have
heard
the
shots
rattle
but
we
seamen
rejoice
in
the
play
of
the
battle
tho
the
chain
and
the
roll
splintering
around
with
the
blood
of
our
messmates
tho
slippery
the
ground
the
fiercer
the
fight
still
the
fiercer
we
grow
we
heed
not
our
loss
so
we
conquer
the
foe
and
the
hard
battle
won
so
the
prize
be
not
sunk
the
captain
gets
rich
and
the
sailors
get
drunk
samuel
god
help
the
poor
soldier
when
backward
he
goes
in
disgraceful
retreat
thro
a
country
of
foes
no
respite
from
danger
by
day
or
by
night
he
is
still
forced
to
fly
still
to
fight
every
step
that
he
takes
he
must
battle
his
way
he
must
force
his
hard
meal
from
the
peasant
away
no
rest
and
no
hope
from
all
succour
afar
god
forgive
the
poor
soldier
for
going
to
the
war
john
but
what
are
these
dangers
to
those
i
have
past
when
the
dark
billows
roar
to
the
roar
of
the
blast
when
we
work
at
the
pumps
worn
with
labour
and
weak
and
with
dread
still
beheld
the
increase
of
the
leak
sometimes
as
we
rose
on
the
wave
could
our
sight
from
the
rocks
of
the
shore
catch
the
light
in
vain
to
the
beach
to
assist
us
they
press
we
fire
faster
and
faster
our
guns
of
distress
still
with
rage
unabating
the
wind
and
waves
roar
how
the
giddy
wreck
reels
as
the
billows
burst
leap
leap
for
she
yawns
for
she
sinks
in
the
wave
call
on
god
to
preserve
for
god
only
can
save
samuel
there
an
end
of
all
troubles
however
at
last
and
when
i
in
the
waggon
of
wounded
was
cast
when
my
wounds
with
the
chilly
smarted
sore
and
i
thought
of
the
friends
i
should
never
see
more
no
hand
to
relieve
scarce
a
morsel
of
bread
sick
at
heart
i
have
envied
the
peace
of
the
dead
left
to
rot
in
a
jail
till
by
treaty
set
free
old
england
white
cliffs
with
what
joy
did
i
see
i
had
gain
enough
glory
some
wounds
but
no
good
and
was
turn
on
the
public
to
shift
how
i
could
when
i
think
what
i
suffer
and
where
i
am
now
i
curse
him
who
snared
me
away
from
the
plough
john
when
i
was
discharged
i
went
home
to
my
wife
there
in
comfort
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
my
life
my
wife
was
industrious
we
earn
what
we
spent
and
tho
little
we
had
were
with
little
content
and
whenever
i
listen
and
heard
the
wind
roar
i
bless
god
for
my
little
snug
cabin
on
shore
at
midnight
they
seiz
me
they
dragg
me
away
they
wounded
me
sore
when
i
would
not
obey
and
because
for
my
country
i
ventur
my
life
i
was
dragg
like
a
thief
from
my
home
and
my
wife
then
the
fair
wind
of
fortune
chopp
round
in
my
face
and
want
at
length
drove
me
to
guilt
and
disgrace
but
all
for
the
best
on
the
world
wide
sea
cast
i
am
haven
in
peace
in
this
corner
at
last
samuel
come
dick
we
have
done
and
for
judgment
we
call
richard
and
in
faith
i
can
give
ye
no
judgment
at
all
i
been
listening
to
all
the
hard
labours
you
past
and
think
in
plain
troth
you
two
blockheads
at
last
my
lads
where
the
deuce
was
the
wit
which
god
gave
ye
when
you
sold
yourselves
first
to
the
army
or
navy
by
land
and
by
sea
hunting
dangers
to
roam
when
you
might
have
been
hang
so
much
easier
at
home
but
you
now
snug
and
settled
and
safe
from
foul
weather
so
drink
up
your
grog
and
be
merry
together
frederic
time
night
scene
the
woods
where
shall
i
turn
me
whither
shall
i
bend
my
weary
way
thus
worn
with
toil
and
faint
how
thro
the
thorny
mazes
of
this
wood
attain
my
distant
dwelling
that
deep
cry
that
rings
along
the
forest
seems
to
sound
my
parting
knell
it
is
the
midnight
howl
of
hungry
monsters
prowling
for
their
prey
again
oh
save
me
save
me
gracious
heaven
i
am
not
fit
to
die
thou
coward
wretch
why
heaves
thy
trembling
heart
why
shake
thy
limbs
beneath
their
palsied
burden
is
there
ought
so
lovely
in
existence
thou
drain
even
to
its
dregs
the
bitter
draught
of
life
dash
down
the
loathly
bowl
poor
outcast
slave
stamp
with
the
brand
of
vice
and
infamy
why
should
the
villain
frederic
shrink
from
death
death
where
the
magic
in
that
empty
name
that
chills
my
inmost
heart
why
at
the
thought
starts
the
cold
dew
of
fear
on
every
limb
there
are
no
terrors
to
surround
the
grave
when
the
calm
mind
collected
in
itself
surveys
that
narrow
house
the
ghastly
train
that
haunt
the
midnight
of
delirious
guilt
then
vanish
in
that
home
of
endless
rest
all
sorrows
would
i
might
slumber
there
why
then
this
panting
of
the
fearful
heart
this
miser
love
of
life
that
dreads
to
lose
its
cherish
torment
shall
the
diseased
man
yield
up
his
members
to
the
surgeon
knife
doubtful
of
succour
but
to
ease
his
frame
of
fleshly
anguish
and
the
coward

wonted
call
that
on
thy
dull
sense
sunk
with
fruitless
repetition
the
warm
sun
would
still
have
cheer
thy
slumber
thou
didst
love
to
lick
the

that
fed
thee

past

active

even
life
itself
was
comfort
poor
old
friend
most
earnestly
would
i
have
pleaded
for
thee
thou
hadst
been
still
the
companion
of

sports
and
as
i
roam

woody
clifts
from
many
a
has
thy
short
quick
bark
recall
my
wandering
soul
i
have
often
the
melancholy
hours
at
school
sour
by
some
little
tyrant
with
the
thought
of
distant
home
and
i
remember
then
thy
faithful
fondness
for
not
mean
the
joy
returning
at
the
pleasant
holydays
i
felt
from
thy
dumb
welcome
pensively
sometimes
have
i
remark
thy
slow
decay
feeling
myself
changed
too
and
musing
much
on
many
a
sad
vicissitude
of
life
ah
poor
companion
when
thou
followedst
last
thy
master
parting
footsteps
to
the
gate
that
clos
for
ever
on
him
thou
didst
lose
thy
truest
friend
and
none
was
left
to
plead
for
the
old
age
of
brute
fidelity
but
fare
thee
well
mine
is
no
narrow
creed
and
he
who
gave
thee
being
did
not
frame
the
mystery
of
life
to
be
the
sport
of
merciless
man
there
is
another
world
for
all
that
live
and
move
a
better
one
where
the
proud
bipeds
who
would

confine
infinite
goodness
to
the
little
bounds
of
their
own
charity
may
envy
thee

the

upon

during

could
not
proceed

the

direction
one
scene
made
an
impression
upon
my
memory
which
time
will
never
be
able
to
efface
near
another
cart
we
perceived
a
stout
looking
man
and
a
beautiful
young
woman
with
an
infant
about
seven
months
old
at
the
breast
all
three
frozen
and
dead
the
mother
had
most
certainly
expired
in
the
act
of
suckling
her
child
as
with
one
breast
exposed
she
lay
upon
the
drifted
snow
the
milk
to
all
appearance
in
a
stream
drawn
from
the
nipple
by
the
babe
and
instantly
congealed
the
infant
seemed
as
if
its
lips
had
but
just
then
been
disengaged
and
it
reposed
its
little
head
upon
the
mother
bosom
with
an
overflow
of
milk
frozen
as
it
trickled
from
the
mouth
their
countenances
were
perfectly
composed
and
fresh

down

path
urging
his

grotesque
and
bidding
now
his

rough
dog
from
some
near
cliff
to
drive
the
straggler
while
his
barkings
loud
and
quick
amid
their
trembling
bleat
arising
oft
fainter

from
the

road
send
their
far
echoes
till
the

bursting
from

cliff
beneath

murmurs
drown
a
little
yet
onward

gain
the

mary
the
story
of
the
following
ballad
was
related
to
me
when
a
school
boy
as
a
fact
which
had
really
happened
in
the
north
of
england
i
have
adopted
the
metre
of
lewis
alonzo
and
imogene
a
poem
deservedly
popular
mary
i
who
is
she
the
poor
maniac
whose
eyes
seem
a
heart
overcharged
to
express
she
weeps
not
yet
often
and
deeply
she
sighs
she
never
complains
but
her
silence
implies
the
composure
of
settled
distress
ii
no
aid
no
compassion
the
maniac
will
seek
cold
and
hunger
awake
not
her
care
thro
her
rags
do
the
winds
of
the
winter
blow
bleak
on
her
poor
withered
bosom
half
bare
and
her
cheek
has
the
deathy
pale
hue
of
despair
iii
yet
chearful
and
happy
nor
distant
the
day
poor
mary
the
maniac
has
been
the
traveller
remembers
who
journeyed
this
way
no
damsel
so
lovely
no
damsel
so
gay
as
mary
the
maid
of
the
inn
iv
her
chearful
address
fill
the
guests
with
delight
as
she
welcomed
them
in
with
a
smile
her
heart
was
a
stranger
to
childish
affright
and
mary
would
walk
by
the
abbey
at
night
when
the
wind
whistled
down
the
dark
aisle
she
loved
and
young
richard
had
settled
the
day
and
she
hoped
to
be
happy
for
life
but
richard
was
idle
and
worthless
and
they
who
knew
him
would
pity
poor
mary
and
say
that
she
was
too
good
for
his
wife
vi
was
in
autumn
and
stormy
and
dark
was
the
night
and
fast
were
the
windows
and
door
two
guests
sat
enjoying
the
fire
that
burnt
bright
and
smoking
in
silence
with
tranquil
delight
they
listen
to
hear
the
wind
roar
vii
tis
pleasant
cried
one
seated
by
the
fire
side
to
hear
the
wind
whistle
without
a
fine
night
for
the
abbey
his
comrade
replied
methinks
a
man
courage
would
now
be
well
tried
who
should
wander
the
ruins
about
viii
i
myself
like
a
should
tremble
to
hear
the
hoarse
ivy
shake
over
my
head
and
could
fancy
i
saw
half
persuaded
by
fear
some
ugly
old
abbot
white
spirit
appear
for
this
wind
might
awaken
the
dead
ix
i
wager
a
dinner
the
other
one
cried
that
mary
would
venture
there
now
then
wager
and
lose
with
a
sneer
he
replied
i
warrant
she
fancy
a
ghost
by
her
side
and
faint
if
she
saw
a
white
cow
x
will
mary
this
charge
on
her
courage
allow
his
companion
exclaim
with
a
smile
i
shall
win
for
i
know
she
will
venture
there
now
and
earn
a
new
bonnet
by
bringing
a
bough
from
the
elder
that
grows
in
the
aisle
xi
with
fearless
good
humour
did
mary
comply
and
her
way
to
the
abbey
she
bent
the
night
it
was
dark
and
the
wind
it
was
high
and
as
hollowly
howling
it
swept
thro
the
sky
she
shiver
with
cold
as
she
went
xii
the
path
so
well
known
still
proceeded
the
maid
where
the
abbey
rose
dim
on
the
sight
thro
the
she
entered
she
felt
not
afraid
yet
the
ruins
were
lonely
and
wild
and
their
shade
seem
to
deepen
the
gloom
of
the
night
xiii
all
around
her
was
silent
save
when
the
rude
blast
howl
dismally
round
the
old
pile
over
fragments
still
fearless
she
past
and
arrived
in
the
innermost
ruin
at
last
where
the
elder
tree
grew
in
the
aisle
xiv
did
she
reach
it
and
quickly
drew
near
and
hastily
gather
the
bough
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
seem
to
rise
on
her
ear
she
paus
and
she
listen
all
eager
to
hear
aud
her
heart
panted
fearfully
now
xv
the
wind
blew
the
hoarse
ivy
shook
over
her
head
she
listen
nought
else
could
she
hear
the
wind
ceas
her
heart
sunk
in
her
bosom
with
dread
for
she
heard
in
the
ruins
distinctly
the
tread
of
footsteps
approaching
her
near
xvi
behind
a
wide
column
half
breathless
with
fear
she
crept
to
conceal
herself
there
that
instant
the
moon
a
dark
cloud
shone
clear
and
she
saw
in
the
two
ruffians
appear
and
between
them
a
corpse
did
they
bear
xvii
then
mary
could
feel
her
curdle
cold
again
the
rough
wind
hurried
by
it
blew
off
the
hat
of
the
one
and
behold
even
close
to
the
feet
of
poor
mary
it
roll
she
felt
and
expected
to
die
xviii
curse
the
hat
he
exclaims
nay
come
on
and
first
hide
the
dead
body
his
comrade
replies
she
beheld
them
in
safety
pass
on
by
her
side
she
seizes
the
hat
fear
her
courage
supplied
and
fast
thro
the
abbey
she
flies
xix
she
ran
with
wild
speed
she
rush
in
at
the
door
she
gazed
horribly
eager
around
then
her
limbs
could
support
their
faint
burthen
no
more
and
exhausted
and
breathless
she
sunk
on
the
floor
unable
to
utter
a
sound
xx
ere
yet
her
pale
lips
could
the
story
impart
for
a
moment
the
hat
met
her
view
her
eyes
from
that
object
convulsively
start
for
oh
god
what
cold
horror
then
thrill
thro
her
heart
when
the
name
of
her
richard
she
knew
xxi
where
the
old
abbey
stands
on
the
common
hard
by
his
gibbet
is
now
to
be
seen
not
far
from
the
road
it
engages
the
eye
the
traveller
beholds
it
and
thinks
with
a
sigh
of
poor
mary
the
maid
of
the
inn
donica
in
finland
there
is
a
castle
which
is
called
the
new
rock
moated
about
with
a
river
of
unfounded
depth
the
water
black
and
the
fish
therein
very
distateful
to
the
palate
in
this
are
spectres
often
seen
which
foreshew
either
the
death
of
the
governor
or
some
prime
officer
belonging
to
the
place
and
most
commonly
it
appeareth
in
the
shape
of
an
harper
sweetly
singing
and
dallying
and
playing
under
the
water
it
is
reported
of
one
donica
that
after
she
was
dead
the
devil
walked
in
her
body
for
the
space
of
two
years
so
that
none
suspected
but
that
she
was
still
alive
for
she
did
both
speak
and
eat
though
very
sparingly
only
she
had
a
deep
paleness
on
her
countenance
which
was
the
only
sign
of
death
at
length
a
magician
coming
by
where
she
was
then
in
the
company
of
many
other
virgins
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
he
said
fair
maids
why
keep
you
company
with
the
dead
virgin
whom
you
suppose
to
be
alive
when
taking
away
the
magic
charm
which
was
tied
under
her
arm
the
body
fell
down
lifeless
and
without
motion
the
following
ballad
is
founded
on
these
stories
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
notes
to
the
hierarchies
of
the
blessed
angels
a
poem
by

by
adam

donica
high
on
a
rock
whose
castled
shade
darken
the
lake
below
in
ancient
strength
majestic
stood
the
towers
of
arlinkow
the
fisher
in
the
lake
below
durst
never
cast
his
net
nor
ever
swallow
in
its
waves
her
passing
wings
would
wet
the
cattle
from
its
ominous
banks
in
wild
alarm
would
run
tho
parched
with
thirst
and
faint
beneath
the
summer
scorching
sun
for
sometimes
when
no
passing
breeze
the
long
lank
sedges
waved
all
white
with
foam
and
heaving
high
its
deafening
billows
raved
and
when
the
tempest
from
its
base
the
rooted
pine
would
shake
the
powerless
storm
unruffling
swept
across
the
calm
dead
lake
and
ever
then
when
death
drew
near
the
house
of
arlinkow
its
dark
unfathom
depths
did
send
strange
music
from
below
the
lord
of
arlinkow
was
old
one
only
child
had

donica
was
the
maiden
name
as
fair
as
fair
might
be
a
bloom
as
bright
as
opening
morn
flush
her
clear
white
cheek
the
music
of
her
voice
was
mild
her
full
dark
eyes
were
meek
far
was
her
beauty
known
for
none
so
fair
could
finland
boast
her
parents
loved
the
maiden
much
young
eberhard
loved
her
most
together
did
they
hope
to
tread
the
pleasant
path
of
life
for
now
the
day
drew
near
to
make
donica
eberhard
wife
the
eve
was
fair
and
mild
the
air
along
the
lake
they
stray
the
eastern
hill
reflected
bright
the
fading
tints
of
day
and
brightly
the
water
the
liquid
radiance
wide
donica
little
dog
ran
on
and
gambol
at
her
side
youth
health
and
love
bloom
on
her
cheek
her
full
dark
eyes
express
in
many
a
glance
to
eberhard
her
soul
meek
tenderness
nor
sound
was
heard
nor
passing
gale
sigh
thro
the
long
lank
sedge
the
air
was
hushed
no
little
wave
dimpled
the
water
edge
sudden
the
unfathom
lake
sent
forth
strange
music
from
beneath
and
slowly
the
waters
the
solemn
sounds
of
death
as
the
deep
sounds
of
death
arose
donica
cheek
grew
pale
and
in
the
arms
of
eberhard
the
senseless
maiden
fell
loudly
the
youth
in
terror
shriek
and
loud
he
call
for
aid
and
with
a
wild
and
eager
look
gaz
on
the
maid
but
soon
again
did
better
thoughts
in
eberhard
arise
and
he
with
trembling
hope
beheld
the
maiden
raise
her
eyes
and
on
his
arm
reclin
she
moved
with
feeble
pace
and
slow
and
soon
with
strength
recover
yet
never
to
donica
cheek
return
the
lively
hue
her
cheeks
were
deathy
white
and
wan
her
lips
a
livid
blue
her
eyes
so
bright
and
black
of
yore
were
now
more
black
and
bright
and
beam
strange
lustre
in
her
face
so
deadly
wan
and
white
the
dog
that
gambol
by
her
side
and
lov
with
her
to
stray
now
at
his
alter
mistress
and
fled
in
fear
away
yet
did
the
faithful
eberhard
not
love
the
maid
the
less
he
gaz
with
sorrow
but
he
with
deeper
tenderness
and
when
he
found
her
health
he
would
not
brook
delay
but
press
the
not
unwilling
maid
to
fix
the
bridal
day
and
when
at
length
it
came
with
joy
they
hail
the
bridal
day
and
onward
to
the
house
of
god
they
went
their
willing
way
and
as
they
at
the
altar
stood
and
heard
the
sacred
rite
the
hallowed
tapers
dimly
a
pale
sulphureous
light
and
as
the
youth
with
holy
warmth
her
hand
in
his
did
hold
sudden
he
felt
donica
hand
grow
deadly
damp
and
cold
and
loudly
did
he
shriek
for
lo
a
spirit
met
his
view
and
eberhard
in
the
angel
form
his
own
donica
knew
that
instant
from
her
earthly
frame
howling
the
daemon
fled
and
at
the
side
of
eberhard
the
livid
form
fell
dead
rudiger
divers
princes
and
noblemen
being
assembled
in
a
beautiful
and
fair
palace
which
was
situate
upon
the
river
rhine
they
beheld
a
boat
or
small
barge
make
toward
the
shore
drawn
by
a
swan
in
a
silver
chain
the
one
end
fastened
about
her
neck
the
other
to
the
vessel
and
in
it
an
unknown
soldier
a
man
of
a
comely
personage
and
graceful
presence
who
stept
upon
the
shore
which
done
the
boat
guided
by
the
swan
left
him
and
floated
down
the
river
this
man
fell
afterward
in
league
with
a
fair
gentlewoman
married
her
and
by
her
had
many
children
after
some
years
the
same
swan
came
with
the
same
barge
into
the
same
place
the
soldier
entering
into
it
was
carried
thence
the
way
he
came
left
wife
children
and
family
and
was
never
seen
amongst
them
after
now
who
can
judge
this
to
be
other
than
one
of
those
spirits
that
are
named
incubi
says
thomas
heywood
i
have
adopted
his
story
but
not
his
solution
making
the
unknown
soldier
not
an
evil
spirit
but
one
who
had
purchased
happiness
of
a
malevolent
being
by
the
promised
sacrifice
of
his
child
rudiger
bright
on
the
mountain
heathy
slope
the
day
last
splendors
shine
and
rich
with
many
a
radiant
hue
gleam
gayly
on
the
rhine
and
many
a
one
from
waldhurst
walls
along
the
river
stroll
as
ruffling
the
pleasant
stream
the
evening
gales
came
cold
so
as
they
stray
a
swan
they
saw
sail
stately
up
and
strong
and
by
a
silver
chain
she
drew
a
little
boat
along
whose
streamer
to
the
gentle
breeze
long
floating
fluttered
light
beneath
whose
crimson
canopy
there
lay
reclin
a
knight
with
arching
crest
and
swelling
breast
on
sail
the
stately
swan
and
lightly
up
the
parting
tide
the
little
boat
came
on
and
onward
to
the
shore
they
drew
and
leapt
to
land
the
knight
and
down
the
stream
the
boat
fell
soon
beyond
the
sight
was
never
a
maid
in
waldhurst
walls
might
match
with
margaret
her
cheek
was
fair
her
eyes
were
dark
her
silken
locks
like
jet
and
many
a
rich
and
noble
youth
had
strove
to
win
the
fair
but
never
a
rich
or
noble
youth
could
rival
rudiger
at
every
tilt
and
turney
he
still
bore
away
the
prize
for
knightly
feats
superior
still
and
knightly
courtesies
his
gallant
feats
his
looks
his
love
soon
won
the
willing
fair
and
soon
did
margaret
become
the
wife
of
rudiger
like
morning
dreams
of
happiness
fast
roll
the
months
away
for
he
was
kind
and
she
was
kind
and
who
so
blest
as
they
yet
rudiger
would
sometimes
sit
absorb
in
silent
thought
and
his
dark
downward
eye
would
seem
with
anxious
meaning
fraught
but
soon
he
rais
his
looks
again
and
smil
his
cares
eway
and
mid
the
hall
of
gaiety
was
none
like
him
so
gay
and
onward
roll
the
waining
months
the
hour
appointed
came
and
margaret
her
rudiger
hail
with
a
father
name
but
silently
did
rudiger
the
little
infant
see
and
darkly
on
the
babe
he
and
very
sad
was
he
and
when
to
bless
the
little
babe
the
holy
father
came
to
cleanse
the
stains
of
sin
away
in
christ
redeeming
name
then
did
the
cheek
of
rudiger
assume
a
hue
and
on
his
clammy
forehead
stood
the
cold
convulsive
dew
and
faltering
in
his
speech
he
bade
the
priest
the
rites
delay
till
he
could
to
right
health
restor
enjoy
the
festive
day
when
the
sky
he
saw
the
day
decline
he
called
upon
his
margaret
to
walk
beside
the
rhine
and
we
will
take
the
little
babe
for
soft
the
breeze
that
blows
and
the
wild
murmurs
of
the
stream
will
lull
him
to
repose
so
forth
together
did
they
go
the
evening
breeze
was
mild
and
rudiger
upon
his
arm
did
pillow
the
sweet
child
and
many
a
one
from
waldhurst
walls
along
the
banks
did
roam
but
soon
the
evening
wind
came
cold
and
all
betook
them
home
yet
rudiger
in
silent
mood
along
the
banks
would
roam
nor
aught
could
margaret
prevail
to
turn
his
footsteps
home
oh
turn
thee
turn
thee
rudiger
the
rising
mists
behold
the
evening
wind
is
damp
and
chill
the
little
babe
is
cold
now
hush
thee
hush
thee
margaret
the
mists
will
do
no
harm
and
from
the
wind
the
little
babe
lies
sheltered
on
my
arm
oh
turn
thee
turn
thee
rudiger
why
onward
wilt
thou
roam
the
moon
is
up
the
night
is
cold
and
we
are
far
from
home
he
answered
not
for
now
he
saw
a
swan
come
sailing
strong
and
by
a
silver
chain
she
drew
a
little
boat
along
to
shore
they
came
and
to
the
boat
fast
leapt
he
with
the
child
and

with

with

the

and
lightly
down
the
rapid
tide
the
little
boat
went
on

that
beam
around
pale
splendor
thro
the
night
cast
through
the

down

they

was
mute
with

nor

of
the

broke
on
the
listening

the

began
to

now
hush
thee

spake

swift
he
stept
on

and
him
behind

margaret
close
follow
evermore
it
was
a
place
all
desolate
nor
house
nor

was
there
and
there
a
rocky
mountain
rose
barren
and
bleak
and
bare

at

and
black
from
out
the

two

your

tho
from
your

estranged
and
exiled
from
your
altars
long
i
have
not
ceased
to
love
you
household
gods
in
many
a
long
and
melancholy
hour
of
solitude
and
sorrow
has
my
heart
with
earnest
longings
prayed
to
rest
at
length
beside
your
hallowed
hearth
for
peace
is
there
yes
i
have
loved
you
long
i
call
on
you
yourselves
to
witness
with
what
holy
joy
shunning
the
polished
mob
of
human
kind
i
have
retired
to
watch
your
lonely
fires
and
commune
with
myself
delightful
hours
that
gave
mysterious
pleasure
made
me
know
all
the
recesses
of
my
wayward
heart
taught
me
to
cherish
with
devoutest
care
its
strange
unworldly
feelings
taught
me
too
the
best
of
lessons
to
respect
myself
nor
have
i
ever
ceas
to
reverence
you
domestic
deities
from
the
first
dawn
of
reason
thro
the
adventurous
paths
of
youth
even
to
this
better
day
when
on
mine
ear
the
uproar
of
contending
nations
sounds
but
like
the
passing
wind
and
wakes
no
pulse
to
tumult
when
a
child
for
still
i
love
to
dwell
with
fondness
on
my
childish
years
even
as
that
persian
favorite
would
retire
from
the
court
dangerous
pageantry
and
pomp
to
gaze
upon
his
shepherd
garb
and
weep
humble
happiness
when
first
a
little
one
i
left
my
father
home
i
can
remember
the
first
grief
i
felt
and
the
first
painful
smile
that
cloathed
my
front
with
feelings
not
its
own
sadly
at
night
i
sat
me
down
beside
a
stranger
hearth
and
when
the
lingering
hour
of
rest
was
come
first
wet
with
tears
my
pillow
as
i
grew
in
years
and
knowledge
and
the
course
of
time
developed
the
young
feelings
of
my
heart
when
most
i
loved
in
solitude
to
rove
amid
the
woodland
gloom
or
where
the
rocks
darken
old
avon
stream
in
the
ivied
cave
recluse
to
sit
and
brood
the
future
song
yet
not
the
less
penates
loved
i
then
your
altars
not
the
less
at
evening
hour
delighted
by
the
fire
to
sit
absorbed
in
many
a
dear
deceitful
dream
of
visionary
joys
deceitful
dreams
not
wholly
vain
for
painting
purest
joys
they
form
to
fancy
mould
her
votary
heart
by
cherwell
sedgey
side
and
in
the
meads
where
isis
in
her
calm
clear
stream
reflects
the
willow
bending
boughs
at
earliest
dawn
in
the
hour
and
when
the
rose
i
have
remembered
you
and
when
the
noise
of
loud
intemperance
on
my
lonely
ear
burst
with
loud
tumult
as
recluse
i
sat
pondering
on
loftiest
themes
of
man
redeemed
from
servitude
and
vice
and
wretchedness
i
blest
you
household
gods
because
i
loved
your
peaceful
altars
and
serener
rites
nor
did
i
cease
to
reverence
you
when
driven
amid
the
jarring
crowd
an
unfit
man
to
mingle
with
the
world
still
still
my
heart
sighed
for
your
sanctuary
and
inly
pined
and
loathing
human
converse
i
have
strayed
where
the
chilly
howl
the
blast
and
gaz
upon
the
world
of
waves
and
wished
that
i
were
far
beyond
the
atlantic

in
woodland
haunts
a
sojourner
with
peace
not
idly
fabled
they
the
bards

peopled
earth

they
trod
the
wood
with
reverence
where
the
dryads
dwelt
at

dim
dawn

hour
they
saw
the
oreads
on
their
mountain
haunts
and
felt
their
holy
influence
nor
impure
of
thought
or
ever
with
polluted
hands
touched
they
without
a
prayer
the
naiad
spring
yet
was
their
influence

brief
awe
inspiring
as
the

long
loud

to
the
feeble

many
wrongs
have
sicken
of

was
a
time
when
he
would
weep
to
hear
of
wickedness
and
wonder
at
the
tale
when
for

felt
a

the
oppressor
a

honest
anger

he
judged

trusted
them
to

took
them
to

her

caught
his
warm

and
gored
his

with

it

when
with

round

at

with
it
the

that
are

into
the

the

and
inspires
with
heavenly

as

to

in

like
a

sweet
will
it
be
to
hover
the

then
sweetest
if
as
duty
prompts
with
earthly
care
we
in
their

have
sown
the
seeds
of
truth
and

holy
flowers
whose
odour
reacheth

when
my

sick
with
hope
long
delayed
than
which
no

presses
the
crush

heavier
from
itself
seeks
the
best

often
have
i

that
thou
didst

seward
my
dear
dead
friend
for
not
in

oh
early
summon
in
thy
heavenly
course
was
thy
brief
sojourn
here
me
didst
thou
leave
with
strengthen
step
to
follow
the
right
path
till
we
shall
meet
again
meantime
i
soothe
the
deep
regret
of
nature
with
belief
my
edmund
that
thine
eye
celestial
ken
pervades
me
now
marking
no
mean
joy
the
movements
of
the
heart
that
loved
thee
well
such
feelings
nature
prompts
and
hence
your
rites
domestic
gods
arose
when
for
his
son
with
ceaseless
grief
syrophanes
bewail
mourning
his
age
left
childless
and
his
wealth
heapt
for
an
alien
he
with
fixed
eye
still
on
the
imaged
marble
of
the
dead
dwelt
pampering
sorrow
thither
from
his
wrath
a
safe
asylum
fled
the
offending
slave
and
garlanded
the
statue
and
implored
his
young
lost
lord
to
save
remembrance
then
softened
the
father
and
he
loved
to
see
the
votive
wreath
renewed
and
the
rich
smoke
curl
from
the
costly
censer
slow
and
sweet
from
egypt
soon
the
rites
divulging
spread
before
your
idol
forms
by
every
hearth
the
blinded
pagan
knelt
pouring
his
prayers
to
these
and
offering
there
vain
sacrifice
or
impious
and
sometimes
with
human
blood
your
sanctuary
defil
till
the
first
brutus
chief
arose
he
first
the
impious
rites
put
down
he
fitliest
who
for
freedom
lived
and
died
the
friend
of
humankind
then
did
your
feasts
frequent
recur
and
blameless
and
when
came
the
solemn
festival
whose
happiest
rites
emblem
equality
the
holiest
truth
crown
with

were
your

to
you

vain
sacrifice
for

the

nor

ye
ask

nor
the

with
many
a

ye
ask
the
heart
made
pure
and
by
domestic
peace
and
love
hallowed
to
you
hearken
your
hymn
of
praise
penates
to
your
shrines
i
come
for
rest
there
only
to
be
found
often
at
eve
amid
my
wanderings
i
have
seen
far
off
the
lonely
light
that
spake
of
comfort
there
it
told
my
heart
of
many
a
joy
of
home
and
my
poor
heart
was
sad
when
i
have
gazed
from
some
high
eminence
on
goodly
vales
and
cots
and
villages
embower
below
the
thought
would
rise
that
all
to
me
was
strange
amid
the
scene
so
fair
nor
one
small
spot
where
my
tir
mind
might
rest
and
call
it
home
there
is
a
magic
in
that
little
word
it
is
a
mystic
circle
that
surrounds
comforts
and
virtues
never
known
beyond
the
hallowed
limit
often
has
my
heart
ached
for
that
quiet
haven
haven
now
i
think
of
those
in
this
world
wilderness
who
wander
on
and
find
no
home
of
rest
till
to
the
grave
they
go
them
poverty

the
child
of
wealth
and
power
bad
offspring
of
worse

aye
afflicts
cankering
with
her
foul
mildews
the
chill

them

with

to
the

of

oh
not

justice
not
on
them
let
fall
thy

household
deities
then
only
shall
be
happiness
on
earth
when
man
shall
feel
your
sacred
power
and
love
your
tranquil
joys
then
shall
the
city
stand
a
huge
void
sepulchre
and
rising
fair
amid
the
ruins
of
the

the

grow
there
shall
the
tree
of

strike
its
roots
deep
and
flourish

shall
bless
the

of

when
wealth

all
their
hideous
progeny
shall
sink
annihilate

all
hoping

expecting
all
in
patient
faith
to
you

i
come
studious
of

yet
shall
my

the

footnote
hence
one
explanation
of
the
name
penates
because
they
were
supposed
to
reign
