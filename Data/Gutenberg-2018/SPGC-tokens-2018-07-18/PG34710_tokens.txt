book

the

i
the
child
and
what
she
led
me
into
i
was
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
up
the
avenue
one
raw
fall
evening
when
somewhere
near
the
corner
of
fifty
street
i
was
brought
to
a
sudden
by
the
sound
of
a
child
voice
accosting
me
from
the
stoop
of
one
of
the
handsome
houses
i
was
then
passing
o
sir
it
cried
please
come
in
please
come
to
grandpa
he
sick
and
wants
you
surprised
for
i
knew
no
one
on
the
block
i
glanced
up
and
saw
bending
from
the
open
doorway
the
trembling
figure
of
a
little
girl
with
a
wealth
of
curly
hair
blowing
about
her
sweet
excited
face
you
have
made
a
mistake
i
called
up
to
her
i
am
not
the
person
you
suppose
i
am
a
stranger
tell
me
whom
you
know
about
here
and
i
will
see
that
someone
comes
to
your
grandpa
but
this
did
not
satisfy
her
running
down
the
stoop
she
seized
me
by
the
arm
with
childish
impetuosity
crying
no
no
there
is
time
grandpa
told
me
to
bring
in
the
first
man
i
saw
going
by
you
are
the
first
man
come
there
was
urgency
in
her
tones
and
unconsciously
i
began
to
yield
to
her
insistence
and
allow
myself
to
be
drawn
towards
the
stoop
who
is
your
grandpa
i
asked
satisfied
from
the
imposing
look
of
the
house
that
he
must
be
a
man
of
some
prominence
if
he
is
sick
there
are
the
servants
but
here
her
little
foot
came
down
in
infantile
impatience
grandpa
never
waits
she
cried
dragging
me
with
her
small
hands
up
the
stoop
and
into
the
open
door
if
you
do
hurry
he
think
i
did
do
as
he
told
me
what
man
would
not
have
yielded
the
hall
as
seen
from
the
entrance
was
wide
and
unusually
rich
indeed
an
air
of
the
highest
respectability
as
well
as
of
unbounded
wealth
characterised
the
whole
establishment
and
however
odd
the
adventure
appeared
it
certainly
offered
nothing
calculated
to
awaken
distrust
entering
with
her
i
shut
the
door
behind
me
in
an
instant
she
was
down
the
hall
here
here
she
cried
pausing
before
a
door
near
its
end
the
confidence
with
which
she
summoned
me
i
sometimes
wonder
if
my
countenance
conveys
more
than
the
ordinary
amount
of
good
nature
and
the
pretty
picture
she
made
standing
in
the
flood
of
light
which
poured
from
the
unseen
apartment
toward
which
she
beckoned
me
lured
me
on
till
i
reached
her
side
and
stood
in
full
view
of
a
scene
which
certainly
justified
her
fear
if
not
the
demand
she
made
upon
a
passing
stranger
in
the
midst
of
a
small
room
plain
as
any
office
i
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
standing
who
even
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
seemed
to
be
not
simply
ill
but
in
the
throes
of
actual
dissolution
greatly
disturbed
for
i
had
anticipated
nothing
so
serious
i
turned
to
fly
for
assistance
when
the
little
child
rushing
by
me
caught
her
grandfather
by
the
knees
and
gave
me
such
a
look
i
had
not
the
heart
to
leave
her
indeed
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
do
so
the
appearance
and
attitude
of
the
sick
man
were
startling
even
to
me
though
in
a
state
bordering
on
death
he
was
as
i
have
said
standing
not
lying
and
his
tall
figure
swaying
against
the
large
table
to
which
he
clung
formed
a
picture
of
mental
and
physical
suffering
such
as
i
had
never
before
seen
and
can
never
in
all
my
life
to
come
forget
one
hand
was
pressed
against
his
heart
but
the
other
outspread
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
support
his
weight
had
fallen
on
some
sheets
or
so
of
typewritten
paper
which
slipping
under
the
pressure
put
upon
them
kept
him
tottering
though
he
did
not
fall
he
was
looking
my
way
and
as
i
advanced
into
the
room
his
collapsing
frame
shook
with
sudden
feeling
and
the
hand
which
he
held
clenched
over
his
heart
opened
slightly
revealing
a
scrap
of
paper
crushed
between
his
fingers
struck
with
compassion
for
the
contrast
was
pitiful
between
his
naturally
imposing
appearance
and
his
present
helplessness
i
murmured
some
words
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
and
then
supposing
him
to
be
alone
in
the
house
with
his
grandchild
inquired
what
i
could
do
to
serve
him
he
cast
a
meaning
glance
down
at
his
hand
then
seeing
that
i
did
not
understand
him
made
a
effort
and
held
that
member
out
uttering
some
inarticulate
words
which
i
was
able
to
construe
into
a
prayer
to
take
from
him
the
paper
which
his
stiffening
clutch
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
release
touched
by
his
extremity
and
anxious
to
afford
him
all
the
solace
his
desperate
case
demanded
i
drew
the
paper
from
between
his
fingers
as
i
did
so
i
noted
first
that
it
was
a
portion
of
one
of
the
sheets
i
saw
scattered
about
on
every
side
and
secondly
that
it
was
folded
together
as
if
intended
for
someone
private
perusal
what
shall
i
do
with
this
i
asked
consulting
his
eye
over
which
a
glaze
was
fast
forming
he
let
his
own
glance
wander
eagerly
till
it
fell
upon
some
envelopes
then
it
became
fixed
and
i
understood
drawing
out
one
i
placed
the
slip
in
it
and
fastening
the
envelope
consulted
his
face
with
a
smile
he
answered
with
a
look
so
full
of
thanks
appreciation
and
confidence
that
i
felt
abashed
something
of
more
than
ordinary
significance
was
conveyed
by
that
look
and
i
was
about
to
ask
what
name
i
should
write
on
the
envelope
when
the
faint
sounds
with
which
he
had
been
trying
to
express
his
secret
wishes
became
articulate
and
i
heard
these
words
illustration
one
hand
was
pressed
against
his
heart
to
no
one
no
one
else
to
to
alas
at
this
critical
moment
and
just
as
the
name
was
faltering
on
his
lips
his
utterance
failed
he
strove
for
expression
but
no
words
would
come
in
a
desperation
which
was
but
the
faint
reflection
of
his
own
i
tried
to
help
him
is
it
for
your
lawyer
i
suggested
then
as
he
made
no
sign
i
hastily
added
for
your
doctor
for
your
wife
for
anyone
in
the
house
he
gave
me
one
supreme
look
raised
his
eyes
and
for
an
instant
stood
in
an
attitude
so
expressive
of
joy
and
indefinable
expectancy
that
i
was
astonished
beyond
words
and
forgot
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
death
but
only
for
a
moment
while
i
was
still
marvelling
at
this
sudden
change
in
him
the
child
who
was
clinging
to
him
uttered
a
terrified
scream
and
unloosed
her
arms
then
i
saw
him
sink
gasp
and
fall
forward
and
springing
caught
him
in
my
arms
before
his
head
could
touch
the
floor
alas
it
was
the
last
service
i
could
render
him
by
the
time
i
had
laid
him
down
he
had
expired
and
i
found
myself
in
no
other
company
than
that
of
a
trembling
child
bending
above
the
dead
body
of
a
man
who
with
his
last
breath
had
charged
me
with
a
commission
of
whose
purport
i
understood
nothing
save
that
under
no
circumstances
and
upon
no
pretext
was
i
to
deliver
the
letter
he
had
entrusted
to
me
to
anyone
but
the
person
for
whom
it
was
intended
but
who
was
this
person
ah
that
was
the
question
certainly
my
position
in
this
house
of
strangers
was
a
most
extraordinary
one
ii
the
young
doctor
and
the
old
meanwhile
the
child
had
started
down
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
calling
papa
papa
startled
by
this
intimation
of
another
person
presence
in
a
house
i
had
supposed
to
hold
no
one
but
ourselves
i
hastily
followed
her
till
she
reached
the
floor
above
and
paused
before
a
shut
door
here
something
seemed
to
restrain
her
papa
inside
she
whispered
if
this
was
so
he
was
not
alone
laughter
quick
exclamations
and
the
clink
of
glasses
could
plainly
be
heard
through
the
door
and
shocked
at
the
contrast
offered
by
this
scene
of
mirth
to
the
solemn
occurrence
which
had
just
taken
place
below
i
hesitated
to
enter
and
looked
about
for
some
means
of
communicating
with
the
servants
who
i
now
felt
must
be
below
but
here
the
terrified
child
who
was
clinging
to
my
knee
interposed
i
do
not
think
papa
is
there
papa
does
not
like
cards
uncle
george
does
come
let
look
for
papa
she
dragged
me
toward
the
front
of
the
house
entered
another
room
and
seemed
surprised
to
find
the
light
turned
down
and
her
papa
gone
perhaps
he
is
with
uncle
alph
she
faltered
and
bounding
up
another
flight
of
stairs
turned
around
to
see
if
i
was
behind
her
there
seemed
no
alternative
left
but
to
follow
her
till
i
came
upon
someone
so
i
hastened
up
this
second
staircase
she
had
already
entered
a
room
o
uncle
alph
i
heard
her
cry
grandpa
lying
on
the
floor
downstairs
i
can
not
find
papa
i
so
frightened
and
she
ran
sobbing
towards
the
young
man
who
rose
to
receive
her
in
an
abstraction
which
even
these
startling
words
failed
to
break
for
this
and
other
reasons
i
noticed
him
particularly
notwithstanding
the
embarrassment
of
my
own
position
he
was
a
handsome
man
of
the
type
whose
characteristics
it
would
be
useless
to
describe
since
they
were
of
a
nature
to
suggest
rather
than
explain
the
extent
of
his
attractions
i
afterwards
heard
from
such
of
my
friends
as
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
the
avenue
with
him
that
he
never
failed
to
draw
the
attention
of
something
in
his
features
his
carriage
or
the
turn
of
his
head
and
shoulders
stamping
him
as
a
man
worth
looking
at
not
only
once
but
twice
at
this
moment
however
i
was
not
so
much
impressed
by
his
good
looks
as
by
his
uneasy
and
feverish
expression
he
had
caught
up
a
letter
which
he
had
been
engaged
in
writing
at
our
entrance
and
as
the
child
appeal
rang
out
he
crumpled
it
nervously
in
his
hand
and
dropped
it
into
the
basket
as
a
certain
furtive
haste
characterised
this
action
my
attention
was
caught
by
it
and
i
found
myself
wondering
whether
it
was
a
letter
or
memorandum
he
thus
sacrificed
to
his
surprise
meanwhile
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
take
in
what
the
little
one
wanted
evidently
he
had
not
as
yet
noticed
me
standing
in
the
doorway
and
i
thought
it
best
to
introduce
myself
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
i
am
arthur
outhwaite
of
the
firm
of
robinson
outhwaite
lawyers
i
was
passing
by
the
house
when
this
child
called
me
in
to
the
assistance
of
her
grandfather
whom
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
found
in
a
very
precarious
condition
in
his
study
downstairs
if
he
is
your
father
you
have
my
sympathy
for
his
sudden
demise
he
died
in
my
arms
a
moment
ago
and
having
been
the
witness
of
his
last
moments
i
could
not
leave
the
house
without
explaining
my
position
to
his
relatives
dead
father
it
was
not
grief
it
was
hardly
astonishment
which
gave
force
to
this
brief
and
involuntary
exclamation
it
was
something
quite
different
something
which
it
shocked
me
to
hear
in
his
tones
and
see
sparkle
in
his
eye
but
this
expression
whatever
it
betokened
lasted
but
a
moment
catching
up
the
child
in
his
arms
he
hid
his
face
behind
her
and
rushed
towards
the
door
me
he
hardly
noticed
where
is
he
he
asked
ignoring
or
forgetting
what
i
had
told
him
it
was
the
child
who
answered
in
the
den
uncle
alph
do
take
me
there
i
afraid
set
me
down
i
want
to
find
hope
he
hastily
obeyed
her
and
the
child
ran
away
then
and
only
then
he
seemed
to
take
in
my
presence
you
were
called
in
from
the
street
he
wonderingly
observed
i
do
understand
it
where
were
my
brothers
they
were
near
enough
to
render
him
assistance
why
should
a
stranger
be
called
in
this
was
a
question
for
which
i
had
no
answer
so
i
made
none
he
did
not
seem
to
be
struck
by
the
omission
let
us
go
down
said
he
i
opened
the
door
which
the
little
one
had
closed
behind
her
and
proceeded
toward
the
from
certain
indistinct
noises
which
i
had
heard
during
the
foregoing
short
interchange
of
words
i
expected
to
find
the
house
in
a
state
of
alarm
and
everyone
alert
but
the
were
still
at
their
game
on
the
floor
below
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
my
companion
pause
and
give
an
admonitory
kick
to
the
door
through
which
such
incongruous
noises
issued
father
ill
he
shouted
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
many
passions
and
waiting
for
no
reply
he
rushed
ahead
of
me
downstairs
followed
by
some
partially
sobered
men
among
these
latter
i
noticed
one
whom
i
took
to
be
the
elder
brother
of
him
whom
the
little
one
had
addressed
as
uncle
alph
he
had
the
same
commanding
appearance
the
same
abstracted
air
and
woke
when
he
did
wake
to
the
same
curious
condition
of
conflicting
emotions
but
i
did
not
have
time
to
dwell
long
upon
this
feature
of
the
extraordinary
affair
in
which
i
had
become
thus
curiously
involved
the
alarm
which
had
been
so
slow
in
spreading
above
had
passed
like
wildfire
through
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
we
found
some
servants
standing
in
and
about
the
small
room
where
the
master
of
the
house
lay
stretched
some
were
wringing
their
hands
some
were
crying
and
some
rigid
with
terror
stared
at
the
face
they
had
so
lately
seen
with
the
hue
of
health
upon
it
at
our
approach
they
naturally
withdrew
to
the
hall
and
i
presently
found
myself
standing
between
the
group
thus
formed
and
the
three
or
four
young
gentlemen
visitors
who
had
not
followed
the
brothers
into
the
room
amongst
the
latter
i
saw
one
whose
face
was
not
altogether
unfamiliar
and
it
was
from
him
that
i
gained
my
first
information
concerning
the
man
to
whose
dying
passion
i
had
been
witness
and
from
whom
i
had
received
the
strange
commission
which
unknown
to
those
about
me
made
my
continued
presence
in
this
house
a
necessity
from
which
the
embarrassment
of
the
occasion
could
not
release
me
the
dead
man
was
archibald
gillespie
the
stockbroker
and
railroad
magnate
whose
name
as
well
as
those
of
his
three
spendthrift
sons
was
in
every
man
mouth
since
that
big
deal
by
which
he
had
made
two
millions
in
less
than
two
months
meanwhile
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
the
two
gillespies
into
the
room
where
their
father
lay
came
out
looking
very
pale
he
was
a
doctor
though
to
all
appearance
not
the
family
physician
will
one
of
you
go
for
dr
bennett
he
asked
bring
him
at
once
and
at
any
cost
gillespie
can
not
be
moved
till
he
comes
bennett
evidently
was
the
family
physician
why
ca
he
be
moved
called
out
a
voice
near
me
is
there
anything
wrong
gillespie
was
violently
sick
a
month
ago
i
suppose
he
got
around
too
quickly
but
the
young
doctor
without
replying
stepped
back
into
the
room
leaving
us
all
agog
though
few
of
us
ventured
upon
open
remonstrance
in
another
minute
one
of
the
men
near
me
slipped
out
in
obedience
to
the
request
just
made
is
gillespie
living
i
asked
after
a
moment
spent
in
more
or
less
indecision
where
have
you
come
from
was
the
answer
given
seasoned
by
a
stare
i
bore
with
what
equanimity
i
could
gillespie
has
been
dead
these
fifteen
years
so
the
letter
was
not
meant
for
his
wife
here
i
caught
an
eye
fixed
on
mine
it
was
that
of
one
of
the
servants
who
stood
huddled
about
the
doorway
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
when
this
man
for
it
was
a
male
servant
saw
that
he
had
attracted
my
attention
he
made
me
an
imperceptible
sign
as
he
was
old
and
i
heeded
the
sign
he
made
and
stepped
towards
him
instantly
he
greeted
me
with
the
whisper
you
seem
to
be
the
only
sober
man
here
do
let
them
do
anything
till
leighton
comes
in
he
is
the
saint
of
the
family
sir
is
he
the
little
girl
father
i
asked
the
man
nodded
and
a
good
man
too
he
insisted
a
very
good
man
was
this
honest
judgment
or
sarcasm
i
had
heard
that
each
of
gillespie
sons
had
given
his
father
no
end
of
trouble
meantime
a
silence
deeper
than
that
of
awe
had
spread
throughout
the
house
feeling
myself
out
of
place
and
yet
strangely
in
place
i
drew
aside
into
as
inconspicuous
a
corner
as
i
could
find
and
waited
as
all
the
others
did
for
the
family
physician
while
doing
so
i
caught
stray
glimpses
of
my
first
acquaintance
alfred
gillespie
who
fretted
by
some
anxiety
he
could
not
altogether
conceal
came
more
than
once
into
the
hall
and
threw
furtive
glances
up
the
stairway
was
it
the
little
girl
he
was
concerned
about
if
so
i
shared
his
anxiety
at
last
the
bell
rang
instantly
so
great
was
the
strain
upon
us
we
all
moved
and
one
or
two
bounded
towards
the
door
but
it
was
opened
by
the
butler
with
that
mechanical
habitude
such
old
servants
acquire
and
though
nothing
could
shake
the
calm
deference
of
this
trained
domestic
there
was
something
in
the
bow
with
which
he
greeted
the
newcomer
which
assured
us
that
the
man
we
so
anxiously
expected
had
arrived
i
had
seen
bennett
more
than
once
but
never
before
showing
so
much
anxiety
whether
from
shock
or
some
secret
cause
not
to
be
communicated
to
us
this
old
and
capable
physician
seemed
to
be
in
a
condition
of
as
much
agitation
as
ourselves
and
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
young
doctor
who
stood
beckoning
to
him
from
the
threshold
of
the
little
den
with
an
appearance
of
alacrity
that
nevertheless
had
an
odd
element
of
hesitation
in
it
i
might
not
have
noticed
this
under
other
circumstances
and
am
quite
sure
that
no
one
else
detected
any
peculiarity
in
his
manner
but
to
me
everything
was
important
which
offered
anything
like
a
clue
to
the
proper
understanding
of
a
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
so
deeply
yet
so
secretly
involved
gillespie
physician
remained
for
some
minutes
closeted
with
the
sons
of
the
deceased
and
their
young
medical
friend
then
he
came
out
instantly
i
saw
from
his
expression
that
our
fears
or
rather
those
of
the
young
doctor
were
not
without
foundation
yet
he
was
careful
not
to
raise
an
alarm
and
in
addressing
us
spoke
in
strictly
professional
tones
a
sad
case
gentlemen
gillespie
has
taken
an
overdose
of
chloral
we
will
have
to
leave
him
where
he
is
till
the
coroner
can
be
called
a
gasp
followed
by
the
clink
of
breaking
glass
came
from
the
behind
me
the
old
butler
had
dropped
a
glass
he
had
just
lifted
off
the
of
the
the
doctor
was
at
his
side
in
a
moment
what
is
that
he
demanded
the
butler
stooped
for
the
pieces
only
the
glass
gillespie
drank
out
of
he
asked
for
wine
a
half
hour
ago
your
words
frightened
me
sir
he
did
not
look
frightened
but
old
servants
of
his
stamp
possess
a
strange
immobility
i
will
pick
up
these
pieces
said
the
doctor
stooping
beside
the
man
the
butler
drew
back
bennett
picked
up
the
pieces
they
were
all
dry
evidently
the
glass
had
been
drained
as
he
came
out
he
cast
a
keen
but
not
unkindly
glance
at
the
group
of
young
men
drawn
up
in
the
doorway
which
of
you
was
the
witness
of
gillespie
death
he
asked
i
bowed
i
dreaded
his
questions
yet
saw
no
way
of
evading
them
if
only
gillespie
had
been
able
to
articulate
the
one
word
which
would
have
relieved
me
of
all
further
responsibility
in
this
matter
you
are
the
person
who
was
called
into
the
house
by
grandchild
the
doctor
now
asked
meeting
my
eye
with
the
same
expression
of
instantaneous
and
complete
confidence
i
had
seen
on
the
features
of
his
unhappy
patient
i
am
i
replied
and
proceeded
to
relate
the
circumstances
with
all
the
simplicity
the
occasion
required
only
i
said
nothing
about
the
letter
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
for
delivery
to
some
unknown
person
how
could
i
there
had
been
no
encouragement
in
gillespie
expression
when
i
asked
him
if
the
note
i
had
taken
from
him
was
meant
for
his
doctor
the
account
i
was
able
to
give
of
the
deceased
broker
last
moments
seemed
to
deepen
the
impression
which
had
been
made
upon
the
physician
by
the
condition
in
which
he
found
him
taking
up
the
pieces
of
glass
he
had
collected
from
the
hearth
he
sniffed
them
carefully
during
which
act
the
two
sons
of
gillespie
watched
him
with
starting
eyes
when
he
laid
them
down
again
we
could
none
of
us
conceal
our
curiosity
you
have
something
dreadful
to
communicate
murmured
the
elder
son
the
doctor
hesitated
then
he
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
handsome
faces
before
him
and
remarked
your
brother
is
not
here
do
you
know
if
he
is
likely
to
return
soon
where
is
mr
leighton
inquired
alfred
turning
towards
the
servants
i
thought
he
meant
to
remain
home
the
butler
respectfully
advanced
leighton
went
out
an
hour
ago
said
he
he
and
gillespie
had
a
few
words
in
the
den
sir
after
which
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
did
you
see
your
master
at
that
time
no
sir
i
only
heard
his
voice
did
that
sound
natural
the
old
servant
seemed
loath
to
reply
but
feeling
the
doctor
eye
resting
imperatively
upon
him
he
hesitatingly
admitted
it
was
quiet
sir
if
you
mean
that
gillespie
seemed
to
be
angry
or
very
much
displeased
he
spoke
quite
loud
where
were
you
in
the
sir
putting
away
the
last
of
the
dinner
dishes
did
you
hear
what
your
master
said
no
sir
it
was
something
about
religion
too
much
religion
my
brother
attends
too
many
mission
services
to
please
my
father
explained
alfred
in
a
low
tone
the
doctor
heard
but
did
not
take
his
eye
from
the
old
servant
was
this
before
he
took
the
glass
of
wine
you
have
just
told
us
he
asked
for
yes
sir
just
before
it
was
leighton
who
came
for
it
he
said
his
father
looked
tired
ah
and
how
came
the
glass
to
be
back
then
on
the
i
do
know
sir
perhaps
gillespie
put
it
there
himself
he
never
liked
any
litter
on
his
study
table
sir
at
this
statement
the
older
brother
opened
his
lips
but
i
noticed
he
did
not
speak
there
were
no
traces
of
intoxication
about
him
now
i
wish
you
would
show
me
the
bottle
from
which
you
poured
the
wine
the
butler
whose
name
i
afterwards
learned
to
be
hewson
led
the
way
to
a
large
buffet
extending
half
across
the
wall
from
where
i
stood
in
the
i
could
see
him
pointing
out
a
bottle
of
what
looked
like
sherry
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
that
is
the
one
he
cried
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
the
bottle
i
took
out
for
leighton
was
this
is
quite
full
again
i
saw
the
lips
of
the
elder
brother
move
and
again
he
refrained
from
speaking
i
should
like
to
have
that
bottle
found
said
the
physician
but
no
one
need
look
for
it
now
indeed
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
wait
for
leighton
return
before
making
any
further
movement
george
alfred
may
i
ask
you
to
leave
me
alone
with
your
father
for
a
few
minutes
and
let
the
be
cleared
i
do
want
to
have
to
make
any
excuses
to
the
coroner
when
he
arrives
your
father
has
not
died
a
natural
death
it
was
an
announcement
for
which
we
had
been
in
a
measure
prepared
by
the
serious
manner
of
the
young
doctor
yet
it
seemed
to
me
it
ought
to
have
occasioned
a
greater
or
at
least
a
different
display
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
two
most
intimately
concerned
i
looked
for
an
exchange
of
glances
between
them
or
at
least
some
hurried
words
of
sorrow
or
dismay
but
though
all
evinced
strong
emotion
no
looks
passed
between
them
nor
did
they
make
the
least
attempt
at
mutual
sympathy
or
encouragement
were
they
not
on
confidential
terms
the
moment
certainly
was
one
to
call
out
whatever
brotherly
feeling
they
possessed
i
shall
have
to
make
use
of
the
telephone
bennett
now
announced
you
must
pardon
my
seeming
disrespect
to
the
dead
the
occasion
demands
it
and
with
one
hurried
look
to
see
that
his
commands
had
been
obeyed
and
that
the
had
been
cleared
of
the
huddling
servants
he
stepped
back
into
the
den
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
next
moment
we
heard
his
voice
rise
in
the
inevitable
hallo
i
do
understand
bennett
strange
demeanour
i
now
heard
uttered
in
remark
near
me
it
was
george
speaking
in
a
low
tone
to
his
brother
but
that
brother
with
one
of
his
anxious
looks
up
the
stairs
failed
to
answer
father
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
chloral
but
i
thought
he
always
waited
until
he
got
to
his
own
room
i
never
knew
him
to
take
it
downstairs
before
george
went
on
in
a
low
tone
between
a
whisper
and
a
grumble
this
time
alfred
answered
he
made
an
exception
said
he
when
i
ran
down
to
your
door
at
eight
i
met
claire
coming
out
of
father
room
with
a
bottle
in
her
hand
she
had
been
sent
up
after
the
chloral
and
was
taking
it
down
to
him
george
gave
his
brother
a
suspicious
look
did
she
say
so
he
asked
yes
poor
child
she
will
miss
her
grandfather
i
wonder
if
she
knows
i
felt
that
i
had
no
right
to
listen
but
i
was
standing
where
the
doctor
had
left
me
and
hardly
knew
how
to
withdraw
till
i
had
received
my
dismissal
from
someone
in
authority
yet
i
was
thinking
of
going
farther
front
when
the
doctor
came
out
again
and
approaching
me
remarked
this
delay
is
probably
causing
you
great
inconvenience
but
i
must
ask
you
to
remain
a
short
time
longer
i
presume
you
can
find
a
seat
in
the
with
a
glance
at
the
young
gentlemen
i
expressed
my
obligations
for
his
courtesy
but
did
not
make
a
move
towards
the
room
he
had
indicated
instantly
and
with
an
understanding
of
my
feelings
which
surprised
me
george
took
the
hint
i
had
given
him
and
stepping
forward
raised
a
heavy
plush
curtain
at
the
left
and
begged
me
to
be
seated
in
the
richly
appointed
room
within
but
i
had
hardly
taken
a
step
towards
it
when
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
entrance
into
the
house
of
a
gentleman
whom
i
at
once
took
to
be
the
third
brother
for
whose
presence
all
waited
with
more
or
less
suspense
he
was
sufficiently
prepossessing
in
appearance
to
awaken
admiration
but
he
bore
no
resemblance
to
his
brothers
he
seemed
to
have
more
character
and
less
well
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
just
what
impression
he
made
upon
me
at
this
moment
enough
that
with
my
first
glimpse
of
him
i
felt
confident
that
no
ordinary
person
had
entered
upon
the
scene
though
just
what
special
characteristic
of
his
personality
or
disposition
would
prove
the
emphatic
one
it
was
not
easy
to
judge
at
a
moment
notice
he
had
a
downcast
air
and
to
my
eyes
looked
weary
to
the
point
of
collapse
but
he
roused
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
and
cast
an
inquiring
look
at
the
doctor
and
then
at
the
servants
crowding
in
the
passage
beyond
he
evidently
took
me
for
one
of
his
brothers
boon
companions
what
amiss
he
demanded
in
some
irritation
an
irritation
i
was
fain
to
construe
into
a
total
lack
of
preparation
for
the
fatal
news
awaiting
him
what
the
matter
george
what
the
matter
alph
the
worst
came
in
simultaneous
reply
father
is
dead
cried
george
took
too
much
chloral
added
alfred
leighton
gillespie
stood
for
a
moment
then
threw
off
his
hat
and
rushed
down
the
hall
but
at
the
door
of
what
now
might
be
called
the
chamber
of
death
he
found
the
doctor
standing
in
an
attitude
which
compelled
him
to
come
to
a
sudden
stop
wait
a
moment
said
that
gentleman
i
have
to
correct
an
impression
your
father
has
not
died
from
an
overdose
of
chloral
as
i
had
at
first
supposed
but
from
a
deadly
dose
of
prussic
acid
you
have
only
to
smell
his
lips
to
be
certain
of
this
fact
now
leighton
you
may
enter
iii
what
a
door
hid
it
was
a
startling
declaration
and
the
horror
it
called
up
was
visible
on
every
face
but
the
surprise
which
should
have
accompanied
it
was
lacking
and
however
quickly
the
three
nearest
the
deceased
man
heart
strove
to
cover
up
their
first
instinctive
acceptance
of
a
fact
so
suggestive
of
hidden
troubles
i
could
not
but
see
that
the
prosperous
stockbroker
had
had
griefs
anxieties
or
hopes
to
which
this
sudden
end
seemed
to
those
who
knew
him
best
a
natural
sequence
i
began
to
regret
the
chance
which
had
brought
me
into
such
close
relations
with
this
family
and
felt
the
closed
envelope
in
my
pocket
weighing
on
my
breast
like
lead
meanwhile
he
whom
they
called
leighton
was
saying
in
a
highly
strained
tone
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
make
natural
may
not
bennett
be
mistaken
there
is
the
chloral
bottle
on
the
shelf
over
the
fireplace
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
it
here
does
not
its
presence
in
this
room
argue
that
father
felt
the
need
of
it
prussic
acid
can
only
be
obtained
through
a
doctor
and
i
am
confident
you
never
prescribed
him
such
a
dangerous
drug
dr
bennett
no
for
it
is
totally
inapplicable
to
his
case
but
you
will
find
that
he
died
from
taking
it
leighton
all
his
symptoms
show
it
and
we
have
only
to
determine
now
whether
he
took
it
in
the
chloral
in
the
glass
of
wine
he
drank
or
by
means
of
some
other
agency
not
yet
discovered
i
regret
to
speak
so
unequivocally
but
i
never
mince
matters
where
my
profession
is
concerned
and
besides
the
coroner
would
not
show
you
this
consideration
even
if
i
did
the
fact
is
too
patent
they
were
now
inside
the
study
and
i
did
not
hear
leighton
reply
but
when
they
all
came
out
again
i
saw
that
the
latter
had
not
only
accepted
the
situation
but
that
he
had
been
informed
of
the
part
i
had
been
called
upon
to
play
in
this
matter
this
was
apparent
from
the
way
he
greeted
me
and
the
questions
he
put
concerning
his
conduct
during
the
last
terrible
moments
of
her
grandfather
life
as
he
did
this
i
had
a
fuller
opportunity
for
studying
his
face
it
was
the
most
melancholy
one
i
had
ever
seen
and
what
struck
me
as
being
worthy
of
remark
was
that
this
melancholy
seemed
a
settled
one
and
quite
apart
from
the
present
grief
and
disturbance
yet
he
had
been
heavily
shaken
by
his
father
sudden
if
not
inexplicable
death
or
appeared
to
be
which
possibly
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
i
do
not
understand
why
my
father
should
have
called
anyone
in
from
the
street
to
witness
his
sufferings
while
he
had
sons
in
the
house
he
courteously
remarked
but
having
felt
this
necessity
and
having
succeeded
in
obtaining
such
help
i
am
glad
that
chance
favoured
him
and
us
with
a
person
of
such
apparent
good
feeling
as
yourself
i
scarcely
heeded
him
i
was
pondering
over
the
letter
and
whether
i
should
pass
it
over
to
this
man
but
instinct
withheld
me
or
rather
my
habits
which
happily
acted
as
a
restraint
upon
my
natural
impulse
i
had
received
no
intimation
as
yet
that
it
was
intended
for
any
of
gillespie
sons
you
will
oblige
us
by
waiting
for
the
coroner
he
now
went
on
he
has
telephoned
that
he
will
be
here
immediately
i
shall
wait
i
said
and
it
was
by
his
invitation
i
now
stepped
into
the
parlour
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
passed
before
the
front
door
bell
rang
again
from
the
hubbub
which
ensued
i
knew
that
the
man
we
wished
for
had
arrived
but
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
entered
the
room
in
which
i
sat
during
which
tedious
interim
i
had
to
possess
my
soul
in
patience
but
at
last
i
heard
his
step
on
the
threshold
and
looking
up
i
beheld
a
spare
earnest
man
who
approached
me
with
great
seriousness
and
sat
down
near
enough
to
indulge
in
confidential
talk
without
running
the
risk
of
being
heard
by
anyone
you
are
outhwaite
he
began
i
have
heard
of
your
firm
and
have
more
than
once
seen
robinson
had
you
any
acquaintance
with
gillespie
or
his
family
before
no
sir
gillespie
was
known
to
me
only
by
reputation
then
it
was
pure
chance
which
led
you
to
be
a
witness
of
his
final
moments
pure
chance
if
we
do
not
believe
in
providence
i
returned
he
surveyed
me
quite
intently
relate
what
passed
now
here
was
a
dilemma
did
my
duty
exact
a
revelation
of
the
facts
which
i
had
hitherto
felt
obliged
to
keep
even
from
the
deceased
sons
it
was
a
question
not
to
be
decided
in
a
moment
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
guided
by
developments
and
confined
my
narration
to
a
recapitulation
of
my
former
plain
account
of
gillespie
last
moments
this
narrative
i
made
as
simple
as
i
could
when
i
had
finished
he
asked
if
gillespie
grandchild
had
been
present
at
the
moment
her
grandfather
expired
i
answered
that
she
had
been
clinging
to
him
all
the
time
he
remained
erect
but
shrank
back
and
ran
out
of
the
room
the
moment
he
gave
signs
of
falling
to
the
floor
did
he
speak
to
her
not
that
i
heard
did
he
say
anything
a
few
inarticulate
words
no
names
he
did
not
ask
for
his
sons
no
for
none
of
them
no
how
came
the
alarm
to
be
spread
i
went
up
with
the
child
and
called
the
young
men
down
coroner
frisbie
stroked
his
chin
still
looking
at
me
intently
was
there
an
empty
phial
or
a
piece
of
paper
lying
about
on
the
or
on
the
floor
when
you
went
in
i
started
paper
i
repeated
what
kind
of
paper
such
as
is
used
by
druggists
and
physicians
in
rolling
up
their
prescriptions
the
prussic
acid
which
gillespie
has
evidently
taken
must
have
been
bought
in
liquid
form
the
bottle
which
held
it
should
be
lying
about
and
possibly
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
that
is
if
this
poison
was
swallowed
intentionally
by
mr
gillespie
i
recalled
the
exact
look
of
the
scrap
of
paper
i
had
put
into
an
envelope
at
this
gentleman
request
it
was
not
such
a
one
as
is
used
by
druggists
in
wrapping
up
parcels
and
i
felt
my
breast
grow
lighter
by
a
degree
i
did
not
see
any
such
paper
where
is
the
little
girl
he
now
queried
i
must
see
her
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
if
the
child
said
that
i
had
been
given
a
paper
by
her
grandfather
i
would
acknowledge
it
and
produce
the
envelope
but
if
she
had
forgotten
the
fact
or
had
been
too
frightened
to
notice
it
i
would
preserve
silence
in
regard
to
it
a
little
longer
in
the
hope
of
being
shown
a
way
out
of
my
difficulty
i
was
therefore
not
sorry
to
hear
him
ask
for
the
little
girl
i
take
it
that
you
are
not
anxious
to
remain
here
he
now
remarked
if
you
will
give
me
your
address
and
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
obey
my
summons
i
can
excuse
you
for
the
night
for
answer
i
held
out
my
card
and
seeing
that
i
had
no
further
excuse
for
lingering
was
moving
toward
the
door
when
bennett
came
hurriedly
in
i
have
found
something
he
began
and
then
paused
with
a
quick
glance
in
my
direction
as
if
questioning
the
propriety
of
proceeding
further
with
his
discovery
in
my
presence
the
coroner
showed
no
such
hesitation
hastening
to
meet
the
old
family
physician
he
said
you
have
found
the
bottle
or
only
the
paper
in
which
the
bottle
was
wrapped
bennett
drew
him
aside
and
i
saw
what
looked
like
a
small
cork
pass
between
them
was
it
in
gillespie
study
you
found
this
queried
the
coroner
i
thought
i
had
thoroughly
searched
the
study
the
answer
was
uttered
in
the
lowest
of
low
tones
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
catching
the
gist
of
what
he
said
it
was
on
the
floor
under
the
edge
of
the
rug
a
very
suspicious
fact
do
you
think
so
gillespie
would
never
have
thrust
it
there
some
other
person
do
know
who
not
say
anything
yet
shrink
from
seeing
the
police
in
this
house
the
two
doctors
interchanged
a
look
which
i
surprised
in
the
large
mirror
opposite
but
i
gave
no
sign
of
having
seen
anything
extraordinary
i
felt
too
keenly
the
delicacy
of
my
own
position
next
minute
we
were
all
walking
towards
the
hall
silence
came
in
admonitory
tones
from
the
coroner
as
we
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
let
us
not
disturb
the
young
men
any
further
than
is
necessary
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
cry
where
is
miss
meredith
has
anyone
seen
miss
meredith
i
can
not
find
her
in
any
of
the
rooms
upstairs
hope
hope
where
are
you
hope
called
out
another
voice
charged
with
feeling
hope
did
my
heart
beat
faster
as
this
name
destined
to
play
such
a
part
in
my
future
life
was
sounded
in
my
ears
i
can
not
say
that
heart
has
beat
often
enough
since
at
the
utterance
of
this
sweet
monosyllable
but
at
that
time
well
i
think
i
was
too
interested
in
the
alarm
which
this
cry
instantly
raised
to
note
my
personal
sensations
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
men
and
women
rushed
from
room
to
room
and
i
heard
not
only
this
name
called
out
but
that
of
the
child
which
it
seems
was
claire
can
not
the
child
be
found
either
i
inquired
impetuously
of
the
coroner
who
still
lingered
in
the
lower
hall
it
seems
not
who
is
miss
meredith
it
was
the
old
butler
who
answered
him
she
is
the
young
gentlemen
cousin
said
he
she
was
a
great
favourite
with
gillespie
and
lived
here
like
a
daughter
they
will
find
her
somewhere
upstairs
but
the
prophecy
proved
to
be
a
false
one
slowly
the
servants
came
creeping
down
whispering
among
themselves
and
looking
very
much
frightened
then
we
saw
george
descend
shaking
his
head
impatiently
and
then
leighton
wild
with
an
anxiety
for
which
he
had
no
name
she
must
be
here
he
cried
thinking
only
of
his
child
claire
claire
and
he
began
running
through
the
great
where
we
knew
she
could
not
be
alfred
had
remained
above
suddenly
i
recalled
a
fact
connected
with
my
own
visit
upstairs
have
they
been
up
to
the
fourth
floor
i
inquired
of
bennett
when
i
was
in
alfred
gillespie
room
on
the
third
floor
i
remember
hearing
someone
rush
through
the
hall
i
supposed
at
that
time
it
was
someone
going
below
but
it
may
have
been
someone
going
higher
up
let
us
go
see
the
doctor
suggested
i
followed
him
without
a
thought
as
we
passed
alfred
door
we
could
see
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
a
state
of
rage
which
made
him
oblivious
of
our
approach
he
was
tearing
into
morsels
a
piece
of
paper
which
had
the
same
appearance
as
the
one
he
had
formerly
thrust
into
the
basket
and
as
he
tore
he
muttered
words
amongst
which
i
caught
the
following
why
should
i
write
if
she
loved
me
she
would
wait
she
would
not
run
away
now
unless
he
bennett
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
slid
by
i
hastened
after
him
and
together
we
mounted
the
last
flight
we
were
now
in
a
portion
of
the
building
as
new
to
the
doctor
as
to
myself
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
we
found
the
whole
place
dark
save
for
a
little
glimmer
towards
the
front
which
proved
to
be
a
burning
low
in
one
of
the
attic
rooms
turning
this
up
we
looked
around
opened
a
or
two
then
walked
into
the
back
where
the
doctor
struck
a
match
two
closed
doors
met
our
eyes
one
of
these
upon
being
opened
disclosed
a
room
similar
in
appearance
to
those
in
front
the
other
an
unfinished
garret
half
filled
with
trunks
and
boxes
well
he
ejaculated
as
the
match
went
out
upon
this
scene
this
is
a
mystery
hark
i
urged
our
ears
rather
than
our
eyes
must
do
service
in
this
emergency
he
took
the
hint
and
together
we
listened
till
some
sound
was
it
the
breathing
of
a
person
concealed
near
us
caused
us
both
to
start
and
the
doctor
to
light
another
match
this
time
we
saw
something
but
the
match
went
out
before
we
could
determine
what
annoyed
by
these
momentary
flashes
of
light
i
dashed
back
into
one
of
the
rooms
we
had
left
and
catching
up
a
candle
i
had
previously
noted
there
lit
it
at
the
and
proceeded
back
with
it
to
this
garret
room
instantly
a
sight
full
of
the
strangest
interest
revealed
itself
crouched
against
the
farther
wall
with
eyes
fixed
full
upon
us
we
perceived
a
woman
upon
whose
pallid
face
and
risen
locks
terror
or
some
other
equally
emphatic
passion
had
so
fixed
its
impress
that
she
looked
like
some
affrighted
creature
balked
in
flight
by
some
dreadful
some
unprecedented
sight
which
held
her
that
she
was
beautiful
in
that
touching
feminine
way
which
goes
to
the
heart
did
not
lessen
the
effect
of
her
appearance
nor
were
we
unmoved
by
the
fact
that
the
child
for
whom
the
house
had
just
been
ransacked
lay
curled
up
and
asleep
at
her
feet
who
is
it
i
asked
miss
meredith
the
doctor
pressed
my
hand
we
must
be
careful
he
whispered
she
seems
on
the
verge
of
delirium
the
child
shows
no
fear
i
murmured
meanwhile
the
doctor
was
approaching
the
new
object
of
his
care
why
choose
so
cold
a
place
he
asked
smiling
on
the
young
girl
who
still
clung
as
if
fastened
to
the
wall
against
which
she
had
drawn
herself
claire
will
catch
cold
had
you
not
better
come
downstairs
with
a
start
she
looked
down
at
the
little
one
resting
at
her
feet
and
her
eyes
showed
a
sudden
intelligence
how
did
she
come
here
she
asked
i
did
not
call
her
and
how
came
you
to
be
here
he
smiled
your
white
dress
looks
out
of
place
in
this
garret
she
lifted
herself
straight
up
with
her
back
to
the
wall
claire
who
was
thus
dislodged
from
the
place
at
her
feet
woke
and
began
to
cry
i
heard
that
gillespie
was
dead
came
from
lips
so
stiff
with
fright
or
some
other
deep
emotion
that
i
wondered
they
could
form
the
words
i
loved
gillespie
and
i
brought
my
grief
here
illustration
crouched
against
the
farther
wall
with
eyes
fixed
full
upon
us
she
was
still
standing
pressed
against
the
wall
her
hands
behind
her
and
disguise
the
fact
as
i
would
i
could
see
that
her
teeth
were
chattering
with
something
more
than
cold
or
even
such
fear
as
might
follow
the
sudden
death
of
a
near
friend
and
benefactor
will
you
not
come
below
urged
the
doctor
taking
up
claire
to
his
fatherly
breast
never
her
lips
seemed
to
cry
but
i
heard
no
sound
and
when
the
doctor
giving
me
the
child
threw
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
away
she
yielded
pliantly
enough
though
with
a
steady
look
into
his
face
i
did
not
understand
then
nor
for
a
long
time
afterwards
at
the
we
met
alfred
perhaps
he
had
heard
us
go
up
perhaps
he
had
simply
thought
of
searching
the
attic
himself
his
recoil
and
the
exclamation
he
made
were
simultaneous
you
have
found
her
was
his
cry
a
cry
which
did
not
refer
to
the
child
then
in
reproachful
tones
hope
why
should
you
give
us
such
a
scare
had
we
not
enough
to
face
without
having
our
hearts
wrung
with
terror
for
you
her
answer
was
a
murmur
with
the
first
moment
of
encounter
with
this
man
her
face
had
become
a
mask
iv
he
drank
it
in
making
this
statement
it
is
not
my
wish
to
create
any
special
prejudice
against
alfred
indeed
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
for
when
a
few
minutes
later
his
brother
leighton
came
running
up
the
stairs
at
sound
of
his
child
voice
i
noticed
the
same
recoil
on
her
part
followed
by
the
same
impassibility
nor
did
she
show
a
different
feeling
when
in
the
hall
below
george
came
forward
with
the
inquiries
her
surprising
absence
had
naturally
provoked
from
one
and
all
she
involuntarily
shrank
but
not
without
suffering
to
herself
and
an
obvious
attempt
to
hide
this
natural
impulse
under
a
demeanour
more
in
accordance
with
her
near
relationship
to
these
three
men
in
alfred
this
chilling
conduct
awakened
emotions
only
too
easy
to
read
in
leighton
surprise
and
in
george
a
distrust
bordering
upon
a
passion
so
fierce
that
he
turned
from
white
to
red
and
from
red
to
white
in
an
instant
evanescent
expressions
all
of
them
but
important
as
showing
the
feelings
entertained
towards
her
by
these
men
among
whom
she
had
been
living
for
more
or
less
time
as
a
sister
but
of
my
personal
sensations
you
have
already
heard
too
much
especially
at
this
period
of
my
story
happily
i
was
able
to
hide
them
from
other
eyes
and
simply
showed
a
natural
curiosity
when
bennett
with
a
sly
look
in
her
direction
whispered
in
my
ear
how
came
she
to
know
of
her
uncle
death
so
soon
after
its
occurrence
you
say
you
heard
her
rush
upstairs
while
you
were
in
alfred
room
that
was
very
soon
after
you
laid
the
old
gentleman
out
of
your
arms
is
it
possible
that
you
had
already
met
miss
meredith
did
she
share
that
first
alarm
with
you
not
to
my
knowledge
i
returned
my
first
view
of
her
was
in
the
attic
with
you
yet
she
may
have
been
somewhere
in
this
great
hall
or
in
some
of
the
many
rooms
i
see
about
us
meanwhile
i
was
taking
in
her
beauty
or
what
i
must
call
beauty
from
the
lack
of
any
other
adequate
word
i
believe
she
was
not
what
people
call
beautiful
she
did
not
need
to
be
her
charm
was
incontestable
without
it
too
incontestable
i
fear
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
more
men
than
alfred
and
george
gillespie
she
was
standing
by
the
in
a
position
startlingly
like
that
she
had
maintained
above
and
while
i
shrank
from
the
doubts
thus
called
up
i
could
not
but
perceive
in
the
straightforward
look
of
her
eyes
and
the
fierce
clutch
of
her
hands
behind
her
that
some
determination
was
absorbing
all
her
energies
a
determination
little
in
accord
i
fear
with
the
attitude
of
simple
grief
she
made
such
an
effort
to
maintain
leighton
appeared
to
see
this
also
for
he
set
down
the
child
he
had
been
straining
to
his
breast
and
approaching
his
cousin
plied
her
with
a
few
hurried
questions
but
the
coroner
who
had
shown
some
embarrassment
at
the
appearance
on
the
scene
of
so
young
and
charming
a
lady
advanced
at
this
juncture
and
prevented
the
answer
which
was
slowly
forming
on
her
lips
if
you
are
miss
meredith
gillespie
niece
and
assistant
you
are
justified
in
your
grief
gillespie
has
passed
away
under
very
extraordinary
circumstances
her
hands
which
had
been
behind
her
came
suddenly
together
in
front
but
she
did
not
shift
her
eyes
from
the
point
where
she
had
fixed
them
perhaps
she
dreaded
to
encounter
the
gaze
of
the
three
young
men
grouped
behind
the
man
addressing
her
have
those
circumstances
been
related
to
you
resumed
frisbie
with
the
encouragement
in
his
tone
which
her
loveliness
and
sorrow
naturally
called
forth
no
the
answer
came
quickly
and
with
a
sharp
accentuation
which
showed
her
to
be
a
woman
of
force
notwithstanding
the
condition
in
which
we
had
first
found
her
then
this
little
one
had
said
nothing
he
continued
with
a
glance
at
claire
who
had
nestled
again
at
her
cousin
feet
claire
she
exclaimed
in
evident
surprise
claire
and
her
eyes
followed
his
till
they
fell
inquiringly
upon
the
child
whose
presence
up
to
this
moment
she
had
probably
not
noticed
no
she
has
said
nothing
at
least
nothing
that
i
have
heard
and
her
hand
went
out
as
if
she
would
urge
the
child
away
but
she
did
not
complete
the
gesture
and
i
doubt
if
anyone
understood
her
movement
unless
it
was
myself
the
coroner
seemed
anxious
to
spare
her
feelings
bennett
will
communicate
to
you
our
conclusions
in
this
matter
said
he
i
simply
want
to
ask
you
when
you
last
saw
mr
gillespie
alive
she
asked
her
eyes
stealing
towards
the
door
of
the
little
den
yes
miss
you
surely
have
not
seen
him
dead
i
was
with
him
at
supper
she
returned
we
were
all
there
and
for
the
first
time
she
let
her
gaze
fall
on
each
one
of
her
cousins
in
succession
my
uncle
seemed
as
well
then
as
at
any
time
since
his
illness
he
ate
a
good
meal
and
drank
and
drank
repeated
the
coroner
with
a
stern
look
behind
him
at
the
young
men
who
had
all
moved
at
this
his
usual
glass
of
wine
at
dessert
he
drank
it
she
suddenly
emphasised
her
tone
rising
in
sudden
excitement
i
can
never
forget
that
he
drank
it
alone
a
sigh
or
a
suspicion
of
a
sigh
answered
her
it
came
from
one
of
her
cousins
but
i
never
knew
from
which
at
its
sound
she
shrank
as
if
and
put
up
her
hands
those
hands
and
covered
her
ears
then
she
as
quickly
dropped
them
and
regarded
the
young
men
before
her
slowly
separately
and
with
a
heartrending
significance
i
would
so
gladly
have
joined
him
in
this
attempt
at
sociability
had
i
but
known
it
would
have
been
his
last
she
said
and
dropped
her
head
again
with
a
sob
at
this
look
and
simple
action
a
burden
rolled
from
my
heart
but
upon
the
coroner
and
the
physician
lingering
near
my
side
both
look
and
words
fell
with
a
weight
which
made
this
investigation
if
investigation
it
could
be
called
halt
a
moment
i
do
not
understand
you
observed
the
former
after
a
momentary
interval
surcharged
with
deep
emotion
was
gillespie
in
the
habit
of
sharing
his
wine
with
those
who
sat
at
his
board
that
you
feel
the
pathos
of
that
lonely
glass
so
keenly
yes
i
never
knew
the
dinner
to
close
before
without
some
sort
of
toast
from
one
of
his
sons
it
is
the
coincidence
that
affects
me
but
i
should
not
have
mentioned
it
no
one
could
have
known
that
this
was
destined
to
be
our
last
meal
together
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
now
though
it
seems
more
or
less
incredible
she
was
evidently
unconscious
of
having
raised
the
black
banner
of
suspicion
over
the
heads
of
her
three
cousins
but
the
blank
silence
which
followed
her
words
appeared
to
give
her
some
idea
of
what
she
had
done
for
with
a
sudden
start
and
a
change
in
her
appearance
which
startled
us
all
she
threw
out
her
arms
with
the
cry
you
are
keeping
something
from
me
how
did
my
uncle
die
tell
me
tell
me
at
once
leighton
sprang
for
his
child
caught
her
up
and
fled
with
her
into
a
farther
room
george
tottered
then
drew
himself
proudly
erect
alfred
who
had
been
gnawing
his
in
restrained
passion
alone
stepped
forward
to
her
aid
though
in
a
deprecatory
way
which
robbed
him
of
a
large
part
of
his
natural
grace
but
she
appeared
insensible
to
them
all
her
attention
was
fixed
upon
the
doctor
whom
she
followed
with
an
agonising
gaze
which
warned
him
to
be
brief
if
she
was
to
hear
his
words
at
all
your
uncle
is
the
victim
of
said
he
but
we
have
reason
to
think
he
took
it
some
time
later
than
at
the
evening
meal
prussic
acid
makes
quick
work
the
latter
explanation
fell
unheeded
she
had
fallen
at
the
word
v
hope
this
was
the
proper
moment
for
me
to
leave
or
rather
it
would
have
been
had
it
not
been
for
the
communication
in
my
pocket
which
remained
to
be
delivered
to
go
without
fulfilling
my
duty
in
this
regard
or
at
least
without
stating
to
the
coroner
that
i
held
in
charge
a
paper
of
so
much
importance
seemed
an
improper
if
not
criminal
proceeding
while
to
speak
and
thus
give
up
to
public
perusal
an
enclosure
upon
the
right
delivery
of
which
the
dying
man
laid
such
stress
struck
me
as
an
equal
breach
of
trust
only
to
be
justified
by
my
total
inability
to
carry
out
the
wish
of
the
deceased
as
expressed
to
me
in
his
last
intelligible
appeal
that
this
inability
was
an
assured
fact
i
was
not
yet
convinced
an
idea
had
come
to
me
in
the
last
few
minutes
which
if
properly
acted
upon
might
open
a
way
for
me
out
of
this
dilemma
but
before
making
use
of
it
i
felt
it
necessary
to
know
more
of
this
family
and
the
ties
which
bound
them
to
gain
this
knowledge
was
therefore
of
not
only
great
but
immediate
importance
and
where
could
i
hope
to
gain
it
so
soon
or
so
well
as
here
i
consequently
lingered
and
the
young
medical
friend
of
george
having
for
some
reason
shown
the
same
disregard
as
myself
to
the
open
hint
thrown
out
by
the
coroner
we
drew
together
near
the
front
door
and
fell
immediately
into
conversation
as
he
seemed
on
fire
to
speak
i
left
it
for
him
to
make
the
opening
remark
fine
girl
he
exclaimed
very
fond
of
her
uncle
used
to
help
him
with
his
correspondence
i
hate
to
see
women
faint
though
i
have
been
in
practice
now
two
years
i
have
never
got
used
to
it
anxious
as
i
was
to
understand
the
very
relationship
he
hinted
at
it
was
so
obnoxious
to
me
to
discuss
miss
meredith
with
this
man
whom
i
had
first
seen
in
a
condition
little
calculated
to
prejudice
me
in
his
favour
that
somewhat
inconsistently
i
own
i
turned
the
conversation
upon
gillespie
gillespie
was
then
a
very
busy
man
i
observed
i
judged
so
from
the
look
of
his
den
or
study
overwork
often
drives
men
to
suicide
the
glance
this
called
out
from
the
now
thoroughly
sobered
young
doctor
was
a
sharp
one
yes
he
acquiesced
but
it
was
an
acquiescence
which
from
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
had
a
most
suspicious
ring
my
position
had
now
become
an
embarrassing
one
i
looked
around
for
the
coroner
and
saw
him
talking
earnestly
with
the
old
and
enfeebled
butler
who
seemed
ready
to
sink
with
distress
at
the
same
instant
the
rattling
of
two
keys
could
be
heard
in
their
several
locks
the
was
being
closed
against
intrusion
and
it
was
to
the
coroner
the
keys
were
brought
miss
meredith
who
had
been
carried
into
an
adjoining
room
was
slowly
recovering
this
was
evident
from
the
countenance
and
attitude
of
alfred
gillespie
who
stood
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
room
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
face
this
left
the
hall
clear
and
as
my
companion
chose
to
preserve
silence
i
presently
could
hear
the
story
the
old
butler
was
endeavouring
to
relate
i
was
waiting
on
the
table
as
usual
sir
and
it
was
my
hand
which
uncorked
the
bottle
and
set
it
down
before
gillespie
the
young
gentlemen
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
bottle
they
did
not
even
touch
it
for
none
of
them
seemed
inclined
to
drink
george
said
he
had
a
headache
and
leighton
well
he
makes
a
point
of
not
touching
port
while
alfred
gave
no
excuse
simply
waved
it
away
when
i
passed
it
so
that
the
old
gentleman
drank
alone
he
did
seem
to
feel
quite
happy
sir
and
that
was
why
miss
meredith
got
so
excited
she
never
could
bear
to
see
her
uncle
displeased
with
her
cousins
and
where
is
that
bottle
of
port
and
the
glass
out
of
which
gillespie
drank
at
the
table
o
sir
you
must
excuse
me
sir
but
but
i
drank
what
was
left
in
that
bottle
i
often
do
when
there
is
only
a
little
left
master
did
mind
he
often
said
if
he
was
in
the
mood
to
remember
me
may
finish
that
hewson
and
though
he
did
not
say
it
i
made
so
bold
as
to
remember
the
times
he
had
you
see
i
have
lived
for
twenty
years
in
the
family
i
was
a
young
man
when
gillespie
took
me
into
his
service
first
and
we
had
become
used
to
each
ways
as
for
the
glass
that
was
washed
sir
long
ago
he
was
well
enough
up
to
nine
you
see
sir
or
until
after
he
had
taken
the
sherry
yes
sir
which
you
also
brought
him
no
sir
i
took
it
out
of
the
buffet
sir
but
it
was
leighton
who
carried
it
into
the
den
he
rang
for
me
from
the
and
when
i
came
up
he
asked
for
his
father
bottle
of
sherry
and
i
gave
it
to
him
then
i
went
downstairs
again
and
bottle
has
not
been
found
i
have
not
seen
it
sir
perhaps
someone
else
has
it
was
not
a
full
one
he
had
had
a
glass
or
two
out
of
it
before
you
have
not
said
where
the
glass
came
from
from
which
gillespie
drank
the
sherry
from
the
buffet
also
we
always
keep
a
supply
in
one
of
the
lower
cupboards
sir
did
you
take
it
out
i
think
so
sir
did
you
take
the
first
one
you
came
to
and
hand
it
directly
to
mr
leighton
i
believe
so
was
the
room
light
or
dark
could
you
see
plainly
where
to
lay
your
hand
or
did
you
have
to
feel
about
for
a
glass
i
do
remember
it
as
being
any
too
light
there
was
only
one
turned
on
and
the
room
is
a
big
one
but
i
saw
the
glasses
plainly
enough
i
know
just
where
to
find
them
you
see
sir
very
good
then
you
probably
noticed
whether
the
one
you
took
out
was
clean
they
are
always
clean
i
wear
my
spectacles
when
i
wash
them
the
old
butler
seemed
quite
indignant
yes
yes
then
you
have
to
wear
spectacles
when
i
wipe
the
glasses
yes
sir
the
coroner
pushed
the
matter
no
further
i
think
he
feared
it
would
seem
like
an
attempt
to
fix
the
guilt
on
leighton
besides
he
had
no
time
to
do
so
for
at
this
moment
miss
meredith
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
into
which
she
had
been
carried
and
pausing
there
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
hall
with
an
ardent
and
disquieted
gaze
which
alfred
who
had
started
aside
at
her
approach
tried
in
vain
to
draw
upon
himself
claire
where
is
claire
she
asked
i
want
to
put
her
to
bed
here
she
is
answered
leighton
coming
from
the
with
the
child
fast
asleep
on
his
shoulder
take
her
hope
and
be
careful
not
to
wake
her
better
lay
her
down
as
she
is
than
have
her
frightened
again
hope
held
out
her
arms
i
was
startled
at
her
aspect
miss
meredith
is
not
able
as
yet
to
carry
the
child
upstairs
spoke
up
the
doctor
but
the
child
was
already
nestled
against
her
breast
i
can
carry
her
she
assured
him
drawing
her
head
back
as
the
father
stooped
to
kiss
the
child
are
you
sure
asked
alfred
quite
her
arms
had
closed
spasmodically
over
the
child
let
me
go
with
you
he
prayed
but
catching
the
coroner
eye
he
quickly
added
that
is
if
you
feel
the
need
of
any
assistance
apparently
she
did
not
for
next
minute
i
saw
her
faltering
figure
proceeding
up
alone
while
the
scowl
which
had
begun
to
form
on
george
forehead
had
smoothed
out
and
only
alfred
showed
discomfiture
the
next
minute
the
coroner
had
concentrated
the
attention
of
us
all
by
saying
gravely
to
the
three
young
men
before
him
you
as
sons
of
gillespie
will
surely
see
the
justice
of
my
making
an
immediate
attempt
to
find
out
how
and
when
your
father
took
the
poison
which
to
all
appearance
has
ended
his
invaluable
life
then
as
no
one
replied
he
added
quietly
a
bottle
is
missing
the
bottle
of
sherry
from
which
he
drank
a
glass
since
supper
will
you
grant
me
leave
to
search
the
house
till
i
find
it
so
little
time
has
passed
it
must
assuredly
be
somewhere
within
reach
i
can
tell
you
where
it
is
rejoined
one
of
the
brothers
i
wanted
a
drink
i
had
friends
upstairs
and
i
came
down
and
carried
off
the
first
bottle
i
saw
you
will
find
it
in
my
room
above
we
all
drank
our
share
so
there
can
have
been
no
harm
in
it
it
was
george
who
spoke
and
i
now
saw
why
his
lips
had
moved
when
this
bottle
was
first
mentioned
the
coroner
showed
relief
yet
made
a
movement
singularly
like
a
signal
towards
the
rear
hall
which
i
had
supposed
vacant
since
the
servants
had
been
sent
out
of
it
that
he
was
speaking
in
the
meantime
did
not
detract
from
the
suggestiveness
of
the
gesture
you
and
your
friends
drank
of
it
he
repeated
very
good
that
settles
one
doubt
and
he
waited
or
appeared
to
wait
for
some
event
connected
as
i
felt
sure
with
the
step
we
all
could
now
hear
moving
in
that
hall
suddenly
these
steps
grew
louder
and
a
young
man
evidently
as
much
of
a
stranger
to
the
occupants
of
the
house
as
to
myself
approached
from
the
servants
staircase
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
quietly
the
coroner
took
it
quietly
he
held
it
up
before
the
last
speaker
without
attempting
to
explain
or
to
apologise
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
man
of
whom
he
had
just
made
such
dramatic
use
is
this
the
bottle
you
mean
that
young
gentleman
nodded
the
coroner
held
the
bottle
up
to
the
light
only
a
few
drops
remained
in
it
these
he
both
smelled
and
tasted
you
are
right
said
he
the
contents
of
this
bottle
seem
pure
and
he
handed
it
back
to
the
man
who
immediately
carried
it
out
of
sight
leighton
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
demand
who
this
fellow
was
but
he
did
not
indeed
it
seemed
hardly
necessary
his
confident
manner
his
alert
eye
which
took
us
all
in
at
a
glance
satisfied
us
that
the
event
we
had
all
dreaded
had
transpired
and
that
a
detective
had
entered
the
house
noticing
but
not
heeding
the
effect
which
this
unwelcome
intruder
had
produced
upon
the
proud
trio
he
held
under
his
eye
frisbie
proceeded
with
the
questions
naturally
called
forth
by
the
acknowledgment
made
by
george
you
were
on
this
floor
then
previous
to
your
father
death
possibly
previous
to
his
taking
the
draught
which
has
so
unfortunately
ended
his
life
i
was
on
this
floor
an
hour
or
so
ago
yes
sir
did
you
see
your
father
or
anyone
else
at
that
time
no
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
a
little
ashamed
of
my
errand
it
was
early
in
the
evening
for
the
social
glass
so
i
just
took
the
bottle
off
the
buffet
and
went
back
and
the
glasses
oh
i
always
have
enough
of
them
in
my
room
the
coroner
hand
went
in
characteristic
action
to
his
chin
evidently
he
found
his
position
difficult
no
poison
in
this
bottle
he
declared
none
in
the
one
your
old
butler
drained
and
so
far
as
we
are
able
to
judge
none
in
the
phial
of
chloral
found
standing
on
the
study
mantelpiece
yet
your
father
died
from
taking
prussic
acid
can
not
one
of
you
assist
me
in
saying
how
this
came
about
it
will
save
us
unnecessary
trouble
and
the
house
some
scandal
it
was
an
appeal
which
the
sons
of
gillespie
could
little
afford
to
ignore
yet
while
each
and
all
of
them
paled
under
the
searching
gaze
which
accompanied
it
none
of
them
spoke
till
the
silence
becoming
unendurable
leighton
made
an
extraordinary
effort
and
remarked
my
father
was
a
proud
man
if
he
chose
i
say
if
he
chose
to
end
his
troubles
in
this
unfortunate
way
he
would
plan
to
leave
behind
him
no
sign
of
an
act
calculated
to
bring
such
opprobrium
upon
his
household
he
would
have
acted
under
the
hope
that
his
death
would
be
taken
as
the
result
of
his
late
sickness
that
is
doubtless
why
you
fail
to
find
the
phial
from
which
the
poison
was
poured
hum
yes
i
see
your
father
had
troubles
then
the
answer
was
unexpected
my
father
had
three
sons
none
of
whom
gave
him
unalloyed
comfort
is
not
this
true
george
is
not
this
true
alfred
startled
by
the
sudden
appeal
which
coming
as
it
did
from
a
man
of
great
personal
pride
produced
an
effect
thrilling
to
the
spectators
as
well
as
to
the
men
addressed
the
brothers
flushed
deeply
but
ventured
upon
no
protest
you
and
father
have
always
been
on
good
enough
terms
growled
george
with
an
attempt
at
fairness
which
gained
point
from
the
dogged
air
with
which
it
was
given
this
brought
a
shadow
over
the
face
which
a
moment
before
had
shone
with
something
like
lofty
feeling
i
can
not
forget
that
we
quarrelled
an
hour
before
he
died
murmured
leighton
moving
off
with
an
air
of
great
depression
meantime
i
had
taken
a
resolution
advancing
from
the
remote
end
of
the
hall
where
i
had
been
standing
with
their
young
medical
friend
i
spoke
up
firmly
calmly
but
with
decision
gentlemen
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
what
my
duty
was
i
have
reason
to
think
notwithstanding
my
position
as
a
stranger
among
you
that
the
clue
to
your
father
strange
act
is
to
be
found
in
my
hands
will
you
allow
me
before
explaining
myself
further
to
request
your
answer
to
a
single
question
the
surprise
which
this
evoked
was
shared
by
the
coroner
who
probably
thought
he
had
exhausted
my
testimony
at
our
first
interview
it
is
a
question
which
will
strike
you
as
strange
and
out
of
place
at
a
time
so
serious
but
i
pray
you
to
show
your
confidence
in
me
by
giving
me
a
straightforward
reply
was
gillespie
a
man
of
dramatic
instincts
had
he
any
special
powers
of
mimicry
or
if
i
may
speak
plainly
had
he
what
you
might
call
marked
facial
expression
in
the
astonishment
this
called
out
i
saw
no
dissent
father
was
a
man
of
talent
alfred
grudgingly
allowed
i
have
often
heard
claire
laugh
at
his
stories
which
she
said
were
like
little
plays
but
this
is
a
peculiar
if
not
inappropriate
question
to
put
to
us
at
a
time
of
such
distress
mr
outhwaite
so
i
forewarned
you
i
rejoined
turning
to
the
coroner
frisbie
i
must
throw
myself
upon
your
clemency
when
i
entered
this
house
in
response
to
an
appeal
from
gillespie
grandchild
i
found
that
gentleman
labouring
under
great
mental
as
well
as
physical
distress
he
was
anxious
more
than
anxious
to
have
some
special
wish
carried
out
and
being
found
great
difficulty
in
indicating
what
this
was
but
after
many
efforts
he
made
me
understand
that
i
was
to
take
from
him
a
paper
which
he
held
in
his
clenched
hand
and
when
i
had
done
so
that
i
was
to
enclose
it
folded
as
it
was
in
one
of
the
envelopes
lying
on
the
table
before
us
not
seeing
any
reason
then
for
with
his
wishes
i
accomplished
this
under
his
eye
and
then
asked
him
for
the
name
and
address
of
the
person
for
whom
this
communication
was
intended
but
by
this
time
his
faculties
had
failed
to
such
an
extent
he
could
not
pronounce
the
name
he
could
only
ejaculate
no
one
else
only
to
to
alas
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
but
gentlemen
while
waiting
here
i
have
been
enabled
to
complete
in
my
own
mind
this
final
attempt
at
speech
on
the
part
of
your
father
anxious
to
make
no
mistake
for
the
impression
made
by
his
dying
adjuration
not
to
deliver
this
letter
into
the
wrong
hands
was
no
ordinary
one
i
have
not
allowed
myself
to
be
moved
by
any
hurried
or
inconsiderate
impulse
to
part
with
this
communication
even
to
those
whose
claims
upon
it
might
be
considered
paramount
to
those
of
a
mere
stranger
like
myself
but
since
seeing
miss
meredith
above
all
since
hearing
you
address
her
by
her
name
of
hope
i
can
not
help
feeling
justified
in
believing
that
this
final
communication
from
gillespie
hand
was
meant
for
her
for
when
in
my
perplexity
i
pressed
him
to
give
me
some
sign
by
which
i
could
make
out
whether
it
was
intended
for
his
doctor
his
lawyer
or
his
household
he
roused
and
his
face
showed
an
elevated
look
which
i
now
feel
compelled
to
regard
as
a
dramatic
attempt
to
express
in
action
the
name
he
could
no
longer
utter
gentlemen
i
have
described
his
action
what
name
among
those
you
are
accustomed
to
speak
best
fits
it
hope
was
the
simultaneous
reply
so
i
have
presumed
to
think
and
turning
to
frisbie
i
added
i
have
been
told
that
this
young
lady
was
in
her
uncle
confidence
will
you
allow
me
to
deliver
this
envelope
to
miss
meredith
in
accordance
with
the
injunction
i
firmly
believe
myself
to
have
received
from
mr
gillespie
there
was
a
silence
during
which
no
movement
was
made
then
the
coroner
replied
yes
if
it
is
done
in
my
presence
i
turned
again
to
the
young
gentlemen
commiserate
my
position
and
send
for
miss
meredith
i
prayed
i
feel
bound
to
place
this
in
her
hands
myself
if
i
make
a
mistake
in
thus
interpreting
the
look
given
me
by
your
father
it
will
at
least
be
made
under
your
eye
and
from
unquestionable
motives
with
my
limited
knowledge
of
the
family
i
know
of
no
one
who
has
a
better
claim
to
this
communication
than
she
do
you
none
of
them
attempted
a
reply
bennett
had
already
gone
up
for
miss
meredith
vi
a
happy
inspiration
while
waiting
for
this
young
lady
i
surveyed
the
three
gillespies
with
a
more
critical
attention
than
i
had
hitherto
had
the
opportunity
of
giving
them
as
a
result
george
struck
me
as
being
the
most
candid
leighton
the
most
intellectual
and
alfred
the
most
turbulent
and
ungovernable
in
his
loves
and
animosities
all
were
under
the
same
mental
tension
and
in
all
i
beheld
evidence
of
deep
humiliation
and
distrust
but
this
similarity
of
feeling
did
not
draw
them
together
even
outwardly
but
rather
seemed
to
provoke
a
which
kept
them
widely
apart
as
i
looked
longer
leighton
impressed
himself
upon
me
as
an
interesting
study
possibly
because
he
was
difficult
to
understand
alfred
as
a
good
lover
but
dangerous
hater
and
george
as
the
best
of
good
fellows
when
his
rights
were
not
assailed
or
his
kindly
disposition
imposed
upon
none
of
them
seemed
to
take
any
interest
in
to
them
i
was
simply
a
connecting
link
between
their
dead
father
and
the
letter
i
held
in
charge
for
miss
meredith
meanwhile
the
coroner
showed
but
one
anxiety
and
that
was
for
the
lady
speedy
appearance
and
the
consequent
reading
of
the
letter
upon
which
all
minds
were
fixed
she
came
sooner
than
we
expected
as
her
soft
footfall
descended
the
stairs
a
visible
change
took
place
in
us
all
drooping
figures
started
erect
and
furrowed
brows
grew
smooth
some
of
us
even
assumed
that
appearance
of
reserve
which
men
unconsciously
take
on
when
their
deeper
feelings
are
stirred
only
leighton
acted
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
consequently
it
was
in
his
direction
her
frightened
glances
flew
when
she
realised
that
she
had
been
summoned
for
some
definite
purpose
i
do
know
what
more
you
can
want
of
me
she
protested
in
a
tone
little
short
of
a
frightened
gasp
i
am
hardly
fit
to
talk
but
the
doctor
said
i
must
come
down
why
could
you
have
left
me
with
claire
because
dear
hope
this
gentleman
you
see
here
and
who
as
you
know
was
with
my
father
when
he
died
says
he
has
a
letter
or
some
communication
from
your
uncle
which
he
is
sure
was
meant
for
your
eye
only
do
you
think
my
father
would
be
likely
to
leave
you
such
a
message
have
you
any
reason
for
expecting
his
last
thoughts
would
be
for
you
rather
than
for
his
sons
answer
we
are
quite
prepared
to
hear
you
say
yes
she
had
been
trying
to
steady
herself
without
laying
hold
of
his
arm
but
she
found
this
impossible
with
an
expression
of
deepest
anguish
she
caught
at
his
wrist
and
then
facing
us
murmured
in
failing
tones
he
might
i
have
helped
him
lately
a
great
deal
with
his
must
i
read
it
in
this
last
question
and
her
manner
of
uttering
it
there
was
an
appeal
which
almost
took
the
form
of
prayer
but
it
failed
to
produce
any
effect
upon
the
coroner
favourably
as
he
seemed
disposed
to
regard
her
with
some
bluntness
i
had
almost
said
harshness
he
answered
her
with
a
peremptory
yes
miss
she
was
not
prepared
for
this
refusal
and
her
eyes
full
of
entreaty
flashed
from
one
face
to
another
till
they
settled
again
on
the
coroner
i
can
not
she
protested
spare
me
i
do
not
seem
to
have
full
use
of
my
faculties
my
head
swims
i
can
not
see
let
me
take
it
to
the
light
over
there
i
am
a
nervous
girl
she
had
gradually
drawn
herself
away
from
leighton
the
envelope
which
had
been
given
her
was
trembling
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
wandering
from
george
to
alfred
seemed
to
pray
for
some
encouragement
they
were
powerless
to
give
i
ought
to
be
allowed
the
right
to
read
the
last
words
of
one
so
dearly
loved
without
feeling
myself
under
the
eyes
of
of
strangers
she
finally
declared
with
a
certain
pitiful
access
of
hauteur
certainly
not
natural
to
one
of
her
manifestly
generous
temperament
was
the
shaft
meant
for
me
i
did
not
think
so
but
in
recognition
of
the
hint
conveyed
i
stepped
back
and
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
i
heard
the
coroner
say
if
the
words
you
find
there
have
reference
solely
to
your
own
interests
miss
meredith
you
will
be
allowed
to
read
them
in
privacy
but
if
they
refer
in
any
way
to
the
interests
of
the
man
who
wrote
it
you
will
yourself
desire
to
read
his
words
aloud
as
the
manner
and
meaning
of
his
death
is
a
mystery
which
you
as
well
as
all
the
other
members
of
his
household
must
desire
to
see
immediately
cleared
up
open
it
she
cried
thrusting
it
into
the
hands
of
the
physician
who
by
this
time
had
rejoined
the
group
and
may
god
she
did
not
finish
the
sacred
name
seemed
to
act
as
a
restraint
upon
the
passion
in
whose
cause
it
had
been
invoked
with
her
back
to
them
all
she
waited
for
the
doctor
to
read
the
lines
to
which
she
seemed
to
attach
so
apprehensive
an
interest
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
leave
at
a
moment
so
critical
watching
the
doctor
i
saw
him
draw
out
the
paper
i
had
so
carefully
enclosed
in
an
envelope
and
after
looking
at
it
turn
it
over
and
over
in
such
astonishment
and
perplexity
that
we
all
caught
the
alarm
and
crowded
about
him
for
explanation
alas
it
was
a
simple
one
the
paper
concerning
which
i
had
endured
so
many
qualms
of
conscience
and
from
the
reading
of
which
the
young
girl
had
shrunk
with
every
appearance
of
intolerable
dread
proved
upon
opening
it
to
be
an
absolutely
blank
one
there
was
not
upon
its
smooth
surface
so
much
as
the
faintest
trace
of
words
vii
the
elderly
gentleman
by
the
this
is
surprising
do
you
understand
this
miss
meredith
there
is
nothing
written
here
the
sheet
is
perfectly
blank
she
turned
stared
and
laughed
convulsively
blank
do
you
say
what
a
fuss
about
nothing
no
words
no
words
at
all
let
me
see
i
certainly
expected
you
to
find
some
final
message
in
it
what
a
change
of
manner
the
moment
before
she
had
confronted
us
a
silent
agonised
woman
now
her
words
rattled
forth
with
such
feverish
volubility
we
scarcely
knew
her
the
coroner
not
noticing
or
purposely
blind
to
the
relief
she
showed
handed
her
the
slip
without
a
word
the
brothers
had
all
drawn
off
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
whisper
among
themselves
as
for
myself
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
think
my
position
if
anything
had
changed
for
the
worse
i
seemed
to
have
played
some
trick
i
wanted
to
beg
her
pardon
and
theirs
and
seeing
her
finally
let
the
paper
fall
to
the
floor
with
an
incredulous
shake
of
the
head
i
began
to
stammer
out
some
words
of
explanation
which
sounded
weak
enough
under
the
tension
of
suppressed
excitement
called
forth
in
every
breast
by
this
unexpected
incident
i
feel
i
am
persuaded
you
will
not
give
me
credit
either
for
good
sense
or
for
the
sincerity
of
my
desire
to
be
of
service
to
you
i
made
out
to
say
i
certainly
thought
from
gillespie
actions
above
all
from
the
expressions
which
accompanied
them
that
he
had
entrusted
me
with
a
communication
of
no
little
importance
and
that
this
communication
was
meant
for
miss
meredith
to
my
chagrin
my
plea
went
unheeded
she
was
too
absorbed
in
hiding
her
own
satisfaction
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
and
her
cousins
in
deciding
to
what
extent
their
position
had
been
improved
by
the
discovery
of
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
where
all
had
expected
to
find
words
and
very
important
words
too
consequently
it
fell
to
bennett
to
answer
me
no
one
can
doubt
your
intentions
outhwaite
miss
meredith
will
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
her
indebtedness
to
you
when
she
comes
to
herself
you
have
fulfilled
your
commission
according
to
the
dictates
of
your
own
conscience
that
you
have
failed
to
effect
all
you
hoped
for
is
not
your
fault
as
a
lawyer
you
will
rate
the
matter
at
its
worth
and
as
a
man
of
heart
excuse
the
exaggerated
effect
it
has
to
all
appearance
produced
upon
those
about
you
it
was
a
palpable
dismissal
and
i
took
it
for
such
or
would
have
if
miss
meredith
whose
attention
the
word
lawyer
had
seemingly
caught
had
not
honoured
me
with
a
look
which
held
me
rooted
to
the
spot
wait
she
cried
i
want
to
speak
to
that
young
man
do
not
let
him
go
yet
and
advancing
she
stood
before
me
in
an
attitude
at
once
womanly
and
confiding
come
back
hope
i
heard
uttered
in
the
peremptory
tones
of
him
they
called
leighton
but
though
the
spasm
which
passed
over
her
face
denoted
what
it
cost
her
to
disobey
the
voice
of
so
near
a
relative
she
stood
her
ground
i
need
a
friend
she
said
to
me
someone
who
will
stand
by
me
and
support
me
in
a
task
i
may
find
myself
too
weak
to
accomplish
unaided
i
can
not
have
recourse
to
my
cousins
they
are
too
closely
connected
with
the
sorrows
brought
upon
us
all
by
this
event
besides
i
find
it
easier
to
depend
on
a
stranger
one
who
does
not
care
for
me
as
bennett
does
a
lawyer
too
i
may
need
a
lawyer
sir
will
you
aid
me
with
your
counsels
i
should
find
it
hard
to
come
upon
another
man
of
such
evident
sincerity
as
yourself
hope
hope
entreaty
had
now
become
command
leighton
even
took
a
step
towards
her
she
faltered
but
managed
to
murmur
you
will
not
go
till
i
have
seen
you
again
you
will
not
i
will
not
i
rejoined
putting
down
the
hat
i
had
caught
up
the
next
minute
she
as
well
as
myself
perceived
why
she
had
been
thus
peremptorily
called
back
the
group
around
the
had
changed
a
large
elderly
man
with
a
world
of
experience
in
his
but
kindly
visage
was
standing
in
the
place
occupied
by
the
coroner
a
moment
before
he
was
bowing
in
the
direction
of
miss
meredith
and
he
held
some
letters
in
his
hand
as
her
eyes
fell
on
these
letters
he
regarded
her
with
an
encouraging
smile
and
said
i
am
detective
gryce
miss
i
ask
pardon
for
disturbing
you
and
i
do
want
you
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
my
presence
here
or
upon
the
few
questions
i
have
to
put
on
behalf
of
the
coroner
who
has
just
been
called
to
the
telephone
a
few
explanations
are
all
i
want
and
some
of
these
you
are
in
a
position
to
give
me
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
using
the
typewriter
for
your
uncle
i
am
told
yes
sir
did
you
use
it
for
the
writing
of
these
five
letters
found
upon
his
desk
yes
sir
yes
sir
at
what
hour
between
dinner
time
and
eight
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
acknowledged
having
seen
her
uncle
after
dinner
so
you
were
with
him
until
eight
yes
or
thereabouts
and
left
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
usual
health
to
all
appearance
yes
before
or
after
your
cousin
leighton
came
into
the
study
before
why
did
you
leave
was
gillespie
through
with
his
work
for
the
night
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
but
i
was
tired
and
he
begged
me
to
go
upstairs
in
his
usual
manner
yes
not
like
a
man
anxious
to
have
you
go
no
and
when
did
the
child
come
down
later
not
immediately
no
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
later
humph
the
child
was
with
him
then
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
his
death
i
suppose
so
i
do
not
know
the
detective
waited
a
moment
then
his
hand
closed
over
the
letters
miss
it
is
very
important
to
know
whether
gillespie
anticipated
death
this
correspondence
you
know
it
a
letter
to
simpson
beals
attorneys
dubuque
iowa
another
to
howard
maccartney
augustine
florida
this
to
the
president
of
the
santa
fé
railroad
and
this
to
clarke
beales
nassau
street
city
all
business
letters
i
presume
entirely
so
sir
and
none
of
them
i
judge
such
as
a
man
would
write
who
expected
to
close
all
accounts
with
the
world
in
less
than
an
hour
none
how
laconic
she
was
for
a
girl
scarcely
out
of
her
teens
from
this
correspondence
then
as
you
know
it
he
showed
no
intention
of
suicide
on
the
contrary
in
one
of
those
letters
the
one
to
clarke
beales
i
think
he
made
an
appointment
for
my
uncle
was
very
exact
in
business
matters
he
would
never
have
made
this
appointment
if
he
had
not
hoped
to
keep
it
are
you
two
in
league
the
angry
voice
of
george
broke
in
are
you
trying
to
make
out
that
father
died
from
violence
in
league
did
she
say
it
or
only
look
it
i
felt
my
heart
swell
at
her
piteous
her
agonised
expression
gryce
as
he
called
himself
may
have
seen
it
but
he
appeared
to
be
looking
at
the
slip
of
paper
he
now
drew
from
his
pocket
and
which
we
all
recognised
as
that
which
she
had
shortly
before
let
drop
you
see
this
he
said
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
perfectly
blank
paper
and
it
is
she
declared
why
he
should
send
it
to
me
i
do
not
know
it
was
given
me
in
an
envelope
by
the
gentleman
at
the
door
who
says
he
got
it
from
my
uncle
before
he
died
everyone
here
knows
that
very
good
now
let
me
ask
from
what
sheet
your
uncle
tore
this
scrap
of
paper
you
recognise
it
as
paper
you
have
seen
before
o
yes
it
is
part
of
what
is
used
in
the
typewriter
at
least
i
suppose
it
to
be
it
looks
like
it
sweetwater
bring
me
the
typewriter
sweetwater
was
the
young
man
who
had
before
shown
himself
in
attendance
on
the
coroner
o
what
does
this
mean
asked
hope
shrinking
back
an
oath
answered
her
george
had
reached
the
end
of
his
patience
the
placidity
of
the
old
man
remained
undisturbed
meanwhile
the
young
detective
called
sweetwater
had
returned
with
the
typewriter
in
his
arms
setting
it
down
on
the
library
table
towards
which
they
all
immediately
moved
he
composedly
strolled
my
way
we
were
now
grouped
as
follows
the
family
and
some
others
in
the
library
sweetwater
and
myself
at
the
front
door
illustration
naturally
from
the
point
i
have
just
indicated
i
could
not
look
into
the
library
but
my
hearing
being
good
and
that
of
the
young
detective
still
better
we
both
managed
to
get
the
drift
of
what
was
being
said
though
we
could
not
note
the
speakers
i
had
seen
a
slip
of
paper
protruding
from
the
machine
when
it
was
carried
past
me
and
it
was
to
this
piece
of
paper
gryce
first
called
miss
meredith
attention
there
an
unfinished
letter
here
as
you
see
did
you
have
a
hand
in
writing
it
she
did
not
answer
very
promptly
but
when
she
did
it
was
with
a
no
which
was
startlingly
abrupt
ah
then
there
someone
else
in
the
house
who
uses
the
typewriter
gillespie
he
often
used
it
when
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
i
not
by
gillespie
do
you
think
it
was
he
who
wrote
these
lines
i
do
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
it
was
my
imagination
too
active
or
had
her
voice
a
choked
sound
which
spoke
of
some
latent
emotion
she
strove
to
conceal
then
suavely
responded
the
detective
we
need
no
other
proof
of
gillespie
condition
up
to
the
time
he
worked
off
this
last
line
i
doubt
if
you
ever
made
a
better
copy
yourself
miss
meredith
but
why
is
it
torn
across
in
this
manner
half
of
the
sheet
is
missing
and
some
portion
at
least
of
the
letter
is
gone
a
sudden
gasp
which
could
have
come
from
no
other
lips
than
hers
was
followed
by
certain
short
exclamations
from
the
others
indicative
of
interest
if
not
surprise
shall
i
take
it
out
or
will
one
of
you
read
it
as
it
lies
here
i
prefer
one
of
you
to
read
it
we
heard
a
few
stammering
sentences
uttered
by
george
or
alfred
then
leighton
voice
broke
in
with
the
calm
remark
it
is
about
some
shares
lately
purchased
in
denver
if
you
think
it
necessary
to
hear
what
my
father
had
to
say
concerning
them

facsimile

he
wrote

or
so
before
he

dear
sir
in
regard
to
the
financing
of
the
mentioned
in
our
conversation
on
the
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
i
am
placed
as
soon
as
possible
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
regarding
the
propert
the
rest
is
torn
off
as
you
say
do
you
consider
this
letter
important
not
at
all
except
as
showing
the
sound
condition
of
your
mind
immediately
prior
to
his
collapse
at
ten
it
is
not
the
letter
itself
which
should
engage
your
attention
but
the
fact
that
this
portion
of
it
which
has
been
wrenched
off
can
not
be
found
i
know
he
went
on
before
a
rejoinder
could
be
made
by
anyone
in
the
startled
group
about
him
that
a
strip
seemingly
of
this
same
paper
was
received
by
miss
meredith
in
an
envelope
a
few
minutes
ago
indeed
i
have
it
here
but
though
it
was
evidently
stripped
from
this
same
sheet
from
the
bottom
part
of
it
as
you
can
see
from
its
one
straight
edge
it
does
not
fit
the
portion
left
in
the
machine
some
two
inches
or
so
of
the
sheet
is
lacking
now
where
are
these
two
inches
not
in
the
room
from
which
we
brought
the
typewriter
nor
yet
on
gillespie
person
for
we
have
looked
silence
no
one
seems
to
answer
breathed
a
voice
in
my
ear
had
this
shrewd
and
seemingly
able
detective
expected
a
reply
i
had
not
silence
had
too
often
followed
inquiry
in
this
house
it
is
a
loss
open
to
explanation
mildly
resumed
the
aged
detective
it
is
also
one
which
the
police
deems
important
we
shall
have
to
search
for
that
connecting
slip
of
paper
unless
as
i
sincerely
hope
someone
here
present
can
produce
it
search
a
commanding
voice
broke
in
that
of
leighton
we
know
nothing
about
it
it
is
a
pity
rejoined
the
old
man
with
a
mildness
unusual
in
one
of
his
class
such
a
measure
should
not
be
necessary
someone
here
ought
to
be
able
to
direct
us
where
to
find
this
missing
portion
of
a
letter
interrupted
by
so
stern
a
fact
as
the
writer
death
still
no
answer
had
there
been
a
fire
in
the
room
but
there
was
no
fire
or
had
gillespie
left
the
room
speak
out
the
stern
tones
again
enjoined
you
think
some
of
us
took
it
i
do
not
say
so
was
the
conciliatory
reply
but
this
scrap
must
be
found
its
remarkable
disappearance
shows
that
it
has
more
or
less
bearing
on
the
mystery
of
your
father
death
then
we
must
entreat
you
to
use
your
power
and
find
it
if
you
can
it
was
still
leighton
who
was
speaking
george
alfred
let
us
accept
the
situation
with
good
grace
we
will
gain
nothing
by
antagonising
the
police
two
muffled
oaths
answered
him
their
natures
were
more
passionate
than
his
or
possibly
less
under
control
but
they
offered
no
objections
and
the
next
minute
the
old
detective
appeared
in
the
hall
one
look
passed
between
him
and
the
young
man
loitering
at
my
side
then
the
latter
turned
to
me
this
is
to
be
my
task
he
whispered
i
do
know
the
house
at
all
i
hear
that
you
have
been
up
from
whom
could
he
have
heard
this
from
bennett
it
was
possible
such
fellows
worm
themselves
into
the
confidence
of
warier
persons
than
this
amiable
old
physician
i
have
passed
through
the
halls
i
admitted
none
too
encouragingly
but
i
do
see
how
that
can
help
you
it
a
building
i
suppose
all
the
houses
along
here
are
yes
it
a
house
he
rubbed
one
hand
awkwardly
against
the
other
indeed
his
whole
manner
was
awkward
then
he
walked
slowly
down
the
hall
when
he
reached
the
library
door
he
stopped
and
looked
in
with
a
shy
and
deprecating
air
suddenly
he
began
to
back
away
someone
was
coming
out
it
was
miss
meredith
when
she
was
in
full
sight
and
he
brought
to
a
by
the
wall
against
which
he
had
retreated
he
spoke
but
not
to
her
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
in
a
sort
of
blank
stare
she
may
have
attributed
to
the
power
of
her
beauty
but
which
i
felt
was
of
a
character
to
make
her
careful
four
stories
he
muttered
parlour
floor
first
bedroom
floor
second
bedroom
floor
and
the
attic
where
shall
i
begin
ha
i
think
i
know
he
smiled
and
passed
quickly
down
the
hall
she
had
given
an
involuntary
pressure
to
her
hands
when
he
mentioned
the
word
attic
i
thought
of
the
position
in
which
i
had
found
her
there
of
the
doubts
expressed
by
the
doctor
as
to
how
she
could
have
received
an
intimation
of
her
uncle
death
before
an
alarm
had
been
raised
or
her
cousins
fully
aroused
and
felt
forced
to
acknowledge
that
the
police
were
justified
in
their
action
great
as
was
the
spell
cast
over
me
by
her
loveliness
that
justified
or
not
they
meant
to
do
their
work
i
soon
saw
with
a
steady
eye
the
coroner
held
us
all
to
our
places
while
the
young
detective
disappeared
above
followed
only
by
leighton
who
had
asked
the
privilege
of
accompanying
him
for
fear
of
some
alarm
being
given
to
his
little
child
who
was
upstairs
alone
from
the
way
miss
meredith
eyes
followed
them
i
knew
there
was
something
to
be
feared
from
this
quest
which
she
alone
had
the
power
of
measuring
what
was
i
to
think
of
this
young
girl
who
chose
to
be
reticent
on
a
subject
involving
questions
of
life
and
death
i
would
not
probe
my
doubts
too
closely
i
steeled
myself
against
her
look
resolving
to
be
the
lawyer
her
lawyer
if
required
but
nothing
more
at
least
till
these
shadows
were
cleared
up
her
two
cousins
remained
in
the
library
to
which
gryce
had
returned
after
making
the
signal
to
his
man
sweetwater
we
were
all
under
great
restraint
with
the
exception
of
the
doctor
who
was
chatting
confidentially
with
the
coroner
what
he
said
i
could
in
a
measure
gather
from
the
expression
of
miss
meredith
face
who
was
nearer
him
than
i
that
it
served
to
intensify
rather
than
relieve
the
situation
was
apparent
from
the
gravity
with
which
the
coroner
listened
later
some
stray
words
reached
me
had
the
greatest
dread
of
poison
this
i
distinctly
heard
never
took
any
medicine
without
asking
i
could
not
catch
the
rest
tell
him
symptoms
all
the
poisons
like
a
child
he
poisoned
himself
this
last
rung
in
my
ears
with
persistent
iteration
it
rang
so
loud
i
thought
everyone
on
that
floor
must
have
heard
it
but
i
saw
no
change
in
alfred
restless
figure
hovering
on
the
threshold
of
the
library
door
a
few
feet
behind
miss
meredith
while
george
conversing
feverishly
with
gryce
raised
his
voice
rather
than
dropped
it
as
these
fatal
words
fell
from
the
lips
of
one
who
certainly
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
believing
himself
in
the
confidence
of
his
patient
miss
meredith
who
was
listening
to
something
besides
this
conversation
fateful
as
it
was
was
meanwhile
schooling
herself
for
sweetwater
return
i
could
discern
this
by
the
change
that
passed
over
her
face
just
when
his
steps
began
to
be
heard
and
was
conscious
of
quite
a
personal
shock
when
i
saw
her
hand
fall
involuntarily
on
her
bosom
as
if
the
thing
he
sought
was
and
not
in
the
rooms
above
cursing
myself
for
the
infatuation
which
would
not
let
my
eyes
leave
her
face
i
turned
with
sudden
impulse
into
the
reception
room
opening
on
my
right
but
i
speedily
stepped
back
again
miss
meredith
who
seemed
to
have
gained
some
confidence
by
my
presence
had
feebly
uttered
my
name
it
seemed
that
the
child
had
been
heard
to
cry
above
and
that
the
coroner
had
refused
to
let
her
go
up
i
made
my
way
to
her
side
and
despite
alfred
scowls
entered
into
conversation
with
her
urging
her
to
be
calm
and
wait
patiently
for
the
detective
return
the
child
has
its
father
i
suggested
but
this
did
not
seem
to
afford
her
much
comfort
she
wrung
her
hands
in
her
anxiety
and
showed
no
relief
till
her
cousin
followed
by
the
watchful
detective
was
again
seen
on
the
stairs
then
she
took
my
arm
she
needed
it
for
life
and
death
were
in
the
gaze
she
fixed
upon
the
latter
and
he
well
i
had
never
seen
the
man
before
that
night
yet
i
felt
as
certain
from
the
way
his
feet
fell
on
the
stairs
he
so
slowly
descended
that
he
had
been
successful
in
his
search
and
that
the
piece
of
paper
which
rustled
so
gently
in
his
hand
was
the
one
gryce
had
declared
to
be
of
such
importance
and
which
she
but
what
man
can
complete
a
thought
suggestive
of
distrust
while
the
hand
of
its
lovely
object
presses
warmly
on
his
arm
and
the
eyes
whose
glance
he
both
fears
and
loves
rest
upon
his
in
a
confidence
which
in
itself
is
a
rebuke
i
gave
up
speculation
and
devoted
myself
to
sustaining
miss
meredith
in
her
present
ordeal
as
sweetwater
reached
the
last
step
she
murmured
these
words
i
tried
but
fate
has
rebuked
me
now
i
see
my
duty
her
eyes
had
not
followed
leighton
figure
as
he
joined
his
brothers
in
the
library
but
mine
did
and
it
did
not
make
my
heart
any
lighter
to
see
from
the
glance
he
tossed
her
on
entering
that
he
was
prepared
for
some
event
serious
enough
to
warrant
all
this
emotion
you
have
found
what
you
have
sought
she
cried
intercepting
the
young
detective
in
her
anxiety
to
end
the
suspense
it
took
all
her
strength
to
sustain
his
smile
was
dubious
but
it
was
a
smile
meantime
the
paper
he
held
had
found
its
way
into
the
coroner
hands
call
gryce
shouted
out
that
functionary
with
a
doubtful
look
at
the
slip
in
his
hand
i
shall
need
his
experience
in
deciphering
this
the
detective
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
and
together
they
bent
over
the
scrap
the
suspense
was
great
and
the
moment
intolerable
then
we
saw
the
detective
finger
rest
on
a
certain
portion
of
the
paper
they
were
mutually
consulting
and
remain
there
the
coroner
read
the
words
thus
indicated
and
his
face
showed
both
strong
and
sudden
feeling
ah
he
ejaculated
what
do
you
make
out
of
that
the
detective
uttered
a
few
low
words
and
taking
the
piece
which
had
been
in
the
envelope
he
fitted
it
to
the
one
held
by
the
coroner
we
could
all
see
that
they
were
part
of
the
same
sheet
i
should
like
to
see
if
it
also
fits
the
portion
that
was
left
in
the
typewriter
suggested
the
other
ignoring
the
anxious
looks
bent
upon
him
from
every
side
passing
by
us
all
he
laid
the
three
pieces
together
on
the
library
table
with
a
glance
at
the
young
gillespies
which
was
not
without
its
element
of
compassion
let
us
see
it
what
on
it
urged
alfred
why
this
is
worse
than
father
death
if
miss
meredith
will
tell
me
how
this
central
portion
came
to
be
on
the
attic
floor
i
will
presently
oblige
you
rejoined
the
coroner
she
who
of
all
present
showed
no
interest
in
the
completed
sheet
answered
instantly
and
without
any
further
attempt
at
subterfuge
or
denial
i
carried
it
there
i
had
come
upon
my
uncle
lying
dead
in
his
study
and
thinking
fearing
that
he
had
been
struck
while
at
the
typewriter
i
flew
to
the
latter
and
lifting
up
the
carriage
consulted
the
letter
attached
to
it
for
some
indication
of
this
and
saw
george
leighton
alfred
she
vehemently
cried
facing
them
with
a
look
before
which
each
proud
and
spirited
head
sank
in
turn
i
do
not
know
upon
which
of
your
three
souls
the
weight
of
this
crime
rests
but
one
of
you
one
i
say
lies
under
the
ban
of
your
denunciation
read
and
her
trembling
finger
crossed
that
of
the
detective
and
fell
upon
a
line
terminating
the
letter
which
they
had
already
partially
read
this
was
the
appearance
of
that
letter
as
now
presented
illustration
new
york
james
taylor
state
boston
dear
sir
in
regard
to
the
financing
of
the
mentioned
in
our
conversation
on
the
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
i
am
placed
as
soon
as
possible
in
full
possession
of
the
important
facts
regarding
the
property
covered
by
these
bonds
first
the
actual
cost
per
mile
and
if
such
cost
covers
the
necessary
equipment
for
same
both
for
freight
and
passenger
service
also
if
these
bonds
are
the
first
lien
one
of
my
sons
he
those
last
words
were
written
after
he
felt
himself
sinking
under
the
poison
rang
out
in
instinctive
emphasis
from
her
lips
contradict
me
george
contradict
me
leighton
or
you
alfred
if
you
can
it
would
give
me
new
life
it
would
restore
me
she
was
sinking
fainting
almost
at
the
point
of
death
herself
but
not
a
voice
was
lifted
not
a
hand
raised
this
suggestion
of
crime
had
robbed
them
one
and
all
of
breath
almost
of
life
viii
the
man
behind
the
screen
suddenly
one
voice
rang
out
in
passionate
protest
hope
hope
it
was
not
i
it
was
not
i
and
alfred
leaving
his
brothers
stood
before
his
young
cousin
with
gestures
expressing
a
denial
which
was
george
flushed
and
his
fist
rose
leighton
drooped
his
head
in
shame
or
was
it
sorrow
but
the
next
minute
he
had
that
rebellious
fist
in
his
own
clutch
miss
meredith
kept
her
eyes
turned
sedulously
away
from
them
all
i
only
want
one
of
you
to
speak
the
man
who
can
exonerate
his
brothers
by
confessing
his
own
guilt
do
not
touch
me
this
to
alfred
whose
hand
had
caught
hold
of
her
dress
with
an
air
of
pride
the
first
i
had
seen
in
him
the
youngest
son
of
gillespie
withdrew
from
her
side
and
took
up
his
stand
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hall
you
are
quick
with
your
suspicions
he
flashed
out
what
sort
of
men
do
you
think
us
that
you
should
allow
an
incoherent
phrase
like
this
at
the
end
of
a
letter
begun
in
health
but
finished
in
agony
prejudice
you
to
the
death
against
persons
of
your
own
blood
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
make
me
think
evil
of
you
hope
it
was
a
natural
reproach
and
it
told
not
only
upon
her
but
upon
us
all
the
words
which
had
precipitated
this
situation
might
mean
much
and
might
mean
little
had
the
reputation
of
these
young
men
been
of
a
more
stable
character
or
had
no
attempt
been
made
to
suppress
this
portion
of
the
letter
suspicion
would
never
have
followed
the
discovery
of
this
incongruous
addition
to
the
business
letter
found
in
the
typewriter
one
of
my
sons
he
was
that
an
accusation
of
crime
george
and
leighton
were
on
the
point
of
asserting
not
and
alfred
had
just
begun
to
swagger
with
an
air
of
injured
pride
when
miss
meredith
recovering
herself
laid
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
in
repetition
of
her
former
action
and
slowly
drew
forth
a
letter
the
appearance
of
which
evidently
produced
a
new
and
still
greater
shock
in
the
breasts
of
the
three
young
men
i
shall
not
try
to
vindicate
myself
said
she
i
have
lived
like
a
sister
in
this
house
and
you
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
me
if
it
were
not
for
what
i
hold
here
alfred
you
have
complained
that
the
few
words
left
in
the
typewriter
by
your
dying
father
were
incoherent
and
unsatisfactory
will
you
regard
as
equally
meaningless
this
letter
written
four
weeks
ago
sir
here
she
turned
to
the
coroner
my
uncle
was
ill
a
month
ago
it
was
not
a
dangerous
illness
but
the
remedies
given
oh
bennett
help
me
to
say
it
were
remedies
we
all
knew
to
be
dangerous
if
taken
in
too
great
quantities
one
night
i
can
not
go
on
he
had
reason
to
think
his
glass
was
tampered
with
and
after
that
he
wrote
this
letter
and
charged
me
with
its
delivery
in
case
he
he
ah
i
need
not
say
in
case
of
what
you
have
seen
his
dear
head
lying
low
in
the
room
over
there
only
as
this
letter
is
addressed
to
my
cousins
conjointly
will
you
allow
them
to
read
it
without
witnesses
if
they
will
swear
to
respect
it
and
restore
it
in
an
condition
to
your
hands
it
is
the
only
favour
i
ask
you
to
show
them
and
this
i
humbly
entreat
you
to
grant
if
only
in
recognition
of
what
i
have
suffered
at
having
precipitated
this
horror
when
i
only
meant
to
to
she
was
sinking
falling
nay
almost
at
the
point
of
death
herself
but
she
reached
out
the
letter
and
the
coroner
giving
it
one
glance
handed
it
over
to
leighton
as
the
one
least
shaken
by
the
calamity
which
had
just
overwhelmed
the
house
god
forbid
that
i
should
deny
to
sons
the
privilege
of
being
the
first
to
read
the
last
letter
addressed
them
by
their
father
but
he
made
no
move
towards
drawing
the
curtain
between
himself
and
the
room
from
which
he
was
retreating
nor
could
he
be
said
to
have
really
taken
his
eye
off
any
of
them
during
the
reading
of
this
long
letter
you
see
i
had
need
of
a
friend
murmured
miss
meredith
swaying
towards
me
i
gave
her
a
commiserating
look
was
ever
a
girl
more
unfortunately
situated
two
at
least
of
the
men
against
whom
she
had
felt
forced
to
utter
this
denunciation
of
crime
loved
her
or
so
i
believed
alfred
passionately
george
with
less
show
of
feeling
but
possibly
with
fully
as
much
depth
and
fervour
you
might
have
held
the
letter
back
i
whispered
but
she
met
me
with
a
noble
look
you
mean
if
i
have
not
drawn
suspicion
upon
them
by
my
first
subterfuge
but
with
so
much
in
their
disfavour
how
could
i
calculate
upon
another
opportunity
of
seeing
them
all
together
and
they
must
read
it
together
so
my
uncle
told
me
but
he
never
thought
it
would
be
with
in
the
house
here
the
coroner
advanced
to
question
her
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
my
presence
gave
her
courage
to
bear
up
under
the
ordeal
this
was
what
he
elicited
from
her
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
the
letter
it
had
been
written
by
her
uncle
while
still
on
his
sick
bed
and
after
an
experience
which
i
will
not
relate
here
as
it
will
be
found
more
fully
stated
in
the
letter
itself
this
letter
i
will
reproduce
for
you
at
once
though
it
was
weeks
before
i
knew
its
whole
contents
george
leighton
and
alfred
i
may
not
have
been
a
good
father
but
i
have
at
least
been
a
just
one
though
each
and
all
of
you
since
coming
to
estate
have
given
me
great
cause
for
complaint
i
have
never
been
harsh
towards
you
nor
have
i
ever
denied
you
anything
from
mere
caprice
or
from
an
egotistic
desire
to
save
myself
trouble
yet
to
one
of
you
my
life
is
of
so
little
value
that
he
is
willing
to
resort
to
crime
to
rid
himself
of
me
does
this
shock
you
leighton
george
alfred
we
are
a
christian
family
members
of
an
honourable
community
trained
each
and
all
in
religious
principles
you
by
the
best
the
sweetest
of
mothers
does
it
move
you
to
think
that
one
of
you
could
contemplate
parricide
and
even
attempt
it
it
moves
me
and
in
two
of
you
must
awaken
a
horror
the
anticipation
of
which
affords
me
the
sole
comfort
now
remaining
to
my
doomed
and
miserable
life
for
nothing
will
ever
make
me
believe
that
this
act
was
a
concerted
one
or
that
the
attempt
which
has
just
been
made
upon
my
life
had
its
birth
in
more
than
one
dark
breast
one
guilty
soul
there
is
among
you
but
only
one
and
lest
to
the
remaining
two
the
accusation
i
have
just
made
may
seem
fanciful
unreal
the
result
of
nightmare
or
the
effect
of
fever
i
will
relate
what
happened
in
this
room
last
night
just
as
i
related
it
to
hope
when
she
asked
me
this
morning
why
i
seemed
so
loath
to
see
you
before
you
went
out
to
your
several
lounging
places
i
was
dozing
the
lamp
which
since
my
illness
has
never
been
turned
out
in
my
room
threw
great
shadows
on
wall
and
ceiling
i
seemed
conscious
of
these
shadows
though
i
was
half
asleep
but
not
so
conscious
that
i
was
not
aware
of
the
light
shining
through
the
transom
from
the
gas
jet
near
the
top
of
the
stairs
this
light
has
always
been
company
for
me
especially
in
wakeful
nights
or
when
i
found
myself
troubled
by
dreams
or
any
physical
distress
it
seemed
to
connect
me
with
the
rest
of
the
house
and
simple
as
it
may
seem
to
you
accounts
for
the
cheerfulness
with
which
i
have
declined
the
offers
of
my
sons
to
sit
with
me
during
these
last
painful
nights
i
had
no
need
of
their
company
while
this
light
shone
and
as
for
pain
why
that
is
an
evil
which
all
men
are
called
upon
sooner
or
later
to
endure
i
was
resting
then
in
this
mild
reflected
light
when
suddenly
it
went
out
this
woke
me
for
the
orders
are
strict
that
this
jet
be
left
burning
till
the
servants
come
downstairs
in
the
morning
but
i
did
not
stir
in
my
bed
i
simply
listened
though
aroused
and
somewhat
disturbed
by
this
palpable
disregard
of
my
wishes
i
exerted
all
of
my
faculties
to
detect
the
step
i
now
heard
loitering
about
my
door
but
it
was
studiously
cautious
and
made
no
distinct
sound
in
my
ear
i
did
not
like
this
and
listened
still
more
intently
whereupon
i
heard
the
door
open
and
someone
come
in
softly
and
with
long
pauses
such
as
were
not
wont
to
accompany
the
entrance
of
any
member
of
my
household
i
was
deciding
whether
to
raise
an
alarm
or
lie
still
and
let
myself
be
robbed
of
the
money
which
i
had
just
received
from
the
bank
when
i
heard
the
whispered
father
with
which
one
and
all
of
you
approach
me
at
night
when
you
wish
to
ascertain
if
i
am
asleep
or
awake
why
did
i
hear
myself
called
and
yet
make
no
reply
what
was
in
my
heart
or
what
have
i
seen
of
late
in
your
natures
or
conduct
that
i
should
remain
quiet
under
this
appeal
and
lie
there
and
watchful
i
had
no
definite
reason
for
doubting
any
of
you
i
knew
you
were
in
debt
and
that
two
of
you
at
least
were
in
crying
need
of
money
but
i
hardly
think
i
dreaded
the
rifling
of
my
desk
by
the
hands
of
one
of
my
sons
yet
that
approach
so
gentle
and
so
measured
the
breath
the
shadow
that
grew
and
grew
upon
the
wall
all
these
spoke
of
something
quite
different
from
the
anxiety
of
a
son
keeping
watch
over
a
sick
slumbers
the
desk
was
near
the
window
towards
which
my
eyes
were
turned
in
open
watchfulness
and
i
hoped
by
lying
still
to
catch
sight
of
the
intruder
figure
at
the
moment
of
his
passing
between
me
and
the
faint
illumination
made
on
the
curtains
by
the
street
lamp
opposite
but
the
intruder
did
not
advance
in
that
direction
he
passed
instead
to
the
little
cupboard
over
the
where
as
you
all
know
my
medicines
are
kept
this
i
was
made
aware
of
by
the
faint
click
made
by
one
bottle
striking
another
george
has
come
home
ill
or
leighton
has
one
of
his
terrible
headaches
was
the
soothing
thought
which
then
came
to
me
and
i
found
it
difficult
not
to
speak
out
and
ask
who
was
sick
and
what
bottle
was
wanted
but
the
something
which
from
the
first
had
acted
in
the
way
of
restraint
upon
me
held
me
still
and
i
remained
dumb
while
that
sneaking
hand
continued
to
fumble
among
the
phials
and
glasses
suddenly
a
fear
struck
me
a
fear
so
far
removed
from
any
which
i
had
ever
before
known
that
my
whole
attitude
of
thought
towards
my
sons
must
have
undergone
an
instantaneous
change
a
gulf
opening
where
an
instant
before
was
confidence
and
love
the
medicine
was
kept
there
from
which
my
nightly
dose
was
prepared
a
medicine
which
you
have
all
heard
declared
by
my
physician
to
be
a
deadly
poison
which
must
be
measured
most
carefully
and
given
in
only
such
doses
as
he
had
prescribed
could
it
be
that
my
son
was
feeling
about
for
this
had
george
bet
once
too
often
on
that
mare
which
will
be
his
ruin
or
leighton
found
his
religion
an
insufficient
cloak
for
indiscretions
which
ever
shunned
the
light
of
day
or
alfred
the
child
of
my
heart
he
whom
his
dying
mother
placed
as
a
last
trust
in
my
arms
confounded
the
of
inaction
with
that
weariness
of
life
which
is
the
bane
of
rich
men
sons
i
know
the
despairs
that
come
in
youth
and
i
quaked
where
i
lay
but
it
was
not
upon
that
this
man
at
the
cupboard
was
bent
i
felt
my
whole
frame
tremble
and
my
heart
sink
in
unutterable
despair
as
he
advanced
still
quietly
and
with
great
pauses
up
to
the
of
my
bed
then
around
to
the
side
protected
as
you
know
by
a
screen
till
he
crouched
out
of
sight
but
within
reach
of
the
small
table
where
my
glass
stands
with
the
spoon
beside
it
ready
for
my
use
if
i
grow
restless
and
weary
to
have
turned
to
have
intercepted
the
creeping
figure
in
its
work
and
thus
have
known
definitely
and
forever
which
one
of
you
had
thus
furtively
visited
my
medicine
cabinet
before
proceeding
to
my
bedside
might
have
been
the
natural
course
with
some
but
it
was
not
my
course
i
was
not
content
just
to
interrupt
i
wanted
to
know
the
full
extent
of
what
i
had
to
fear
a
remark
which
bennett
had
once
let
fall
recurred
to
me
transfixing
me
to
my
bed
if
you
were
not
a
careful
man
he
had
said
in
diagnosing
my
present
illness
i
should
say
that
you
had
taken
something
foreign
into
your
system
something
which
has
no
business
there
something
which
under
other
circumstances
and
in
another
man
case
i
should
denominate
it
had
seemed
nonsense
to
me
at
the
time
and
i
laughed
at
what
i
considered
a
fatuous
remark
uttered
with
unnecessary
gravity
but
now
that
there
was
really
poison
in
the
house
and
one
of
my
own
blood
stood
hiding
behind
the
screen
within
a
foot
of
my
medicine
glass
i
could
not
but
choke
down
the
cry
which
this
thought
caused
to
rise
in
my
throat
and
listen
for
what
might
come
alas
i
was
destined
to
behold
with
my
eyes
as
well
as
hear
with
my
ears
the
next
move
made
by
my
unknown
visitant
by
the
grace
of
god
or
through
some
coincidence
equally
providential
the
gas
at
this
momentous
instant
was
relit
in
the
hall
and
i
perceived
amid
the
old
shadows
thus
called
out
upon
the
wall
a
new
one
that
of
a
hand
holding
a
bottle
which
projecting
itself
beyond
the
straight
line
cast
by
the
screen
was
now
stealing
slowly
but
surely
in
the
direction
of
the
table
on
which
stood
my
glass
of
medicine
i
did
not
gasp
or
cry
thought
feeling
consciousness
even
of
my
own
unfathomable
misery
seemed
lost
in
the
one
instinct
to
watch
that
hand
would
it
falter
should
i
see
it
tremble
or
hesitate
in
its
short
passage
across
the
faintly
illumined
space
upon
which
my
eyes
were
fixed
yes
some
monition
of
conscience
some
secret
fear
or
filial
remembrance
made
it
pause
for
an
instant
but
even
as
my
heart
bounded
in
glad
relief
and
human
feelings
began
to
in
my
frozen
breast
it
steadied
and
passed
on
and
though
i
could
no
longer
see
aught
but
a
shadowy
arm
i
could
hear
one
two
three
a
dozen
drops
falling
into
my
drink
a
sound
which
faint
as
it
was
made
the
guilty
heart
behind
the
screen
quake
for
the
hand
shook
as
it
retreated
and
i
beheld
distinctly
outlined
on
the
illumined
space
before
me
the
end
of
the
label
which
marked
the
special
bottle
on
which
the
word
is
printed
in
large
letters
no
further
doubt
was
possible
the
medicine
in
my
glass
had
been
strengthened
and
by
the
hand
of
one
of
my
sons
which
one
in
the
misery
of
the
moment
i
felt
as
if
i
did
not
care
that
any
of
you
should
seek
my
death
was
an
overwhelming
grief
to
me
but
as
thought
and
reason
returned
the
wild
desire
to
know
just
what
and
whom
i
had
to
fear
seized
me
in
the
midst
of
my
horror
mixed
with
another
sentiment
harder
to
explain
and
which
i
can
best
characterise
as
a
feeling
of
dread
lest
i
should
betray
my
suspicions
and
so
raise
between
my
children
and
myself
an
insurmountable
barrier
subduing
my
emotion
and
summoning
to
my
aid
all
the
powers
of
acting
with
which
i
have
been
by
nature
endowed
i
moved
restlessly
under
the
clothes
calling
out
in
a
sort
of
sleepy
alarm
who
there
is
it
you
george
if
so
reach
me
my
medicine
but
no
george
stepped
forth
leighton
i
cried
petulantly
surely
i
hear
one
of
you
in
the
room
but
my
son
leighton
did
not
reply
i
did
not
call
for
alfred
i
could
not
he
was
the
last
son
of
his
mother
did
i
wrong
the
others
in
not
uttering
his
name
also
meantime
all
was
quiet
behind
the
screen
then
i
heard
a
quick
movement
followed
by
the
shutting
of
a
door
and
i
realised
that
an
escape
had
been
effected
from
the
room
in
a
way
i
had
not
calculated
on
that
is
by
means
of
the
opening
out
of
the
alcove
in
which
my
bed
stands
i
had
thought
myself
a
weak
man
up
to
that
hour
but
when
i
heard
that
door
close
i
bounded
to
my
feet
and
attempted
to
reach
the
hall
before
the
man
who
had
thus
escaped
me
could
find
refuge
in
any
of
the
adjoining
rooms
but
i
must
have
fallen
insensible
almost
immediately
for
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
the
of
the
bed
within
reach
of
my
hand
and
the
clock
on
the
point
of
striking
two
i
dragged
myself
up
and
staggered
back
to
bed
i
had
neither
the
courage
nor
the
strength
to
push
the
matter
further
at
that
time
indeed
i
felt
a
sort
of
physical
fear
probably
the
result
of
illness
which
made
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
traverse
the
halls
and
creep
from
room
to
room
seeking
for
guilt
in
eyes
whose
expression
up
to
this
unhallowed
hour
had
betrayed
nothing
worse
than
a
reckless
disregard
of
my
wishes
yet
it
was
torment
unspeakable
to
lie
there
in
an
uncertainty
which
threw
a
cloud
over
all
my
sons
for
hours
my
thoughts
ran
the
one
gamut
george
leighton
alfred
clinging
agonisedly
to
each
beloved
name
in
turn
only
to
drop
into
a
dreadful
uncertainty
as
i
remembered
the
temptations
besetting
each
one
of
you
and
the
readiness
with
which
you
all
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
have
ever
succumbed
to
them
there
was
no
determining
point
in
the
character
of
any
of
you
which
made
me
able
to
say
in
this
solitary
and
awful
communion
with
my
own
fears
this
one
at
least
is
innocent
if
i
dwelt
on
george
generous
good
nature
i
also
recalled
his
wild
extravagance
and
the
debts
he
so
recklessly
heaps
up
at
every
turn
he
makes
in
this
city
if
some
recollection
of
strict
ways
in
open
matters
of
conscience
came
to
soothe
me
there
instantly
came
with
it
the
remembrance
of
the
various
tales
which
had
reached
my
ears
of
certain
secret
attachments
which
drew
him
into
circles
where
crime
is
more
than
a
suggestion
and
murder
a
possible
attendant
upon
every
feast
then
alfred
youngest
of
all
but
the
least
youthful
in
his
attitude
towards
the
world
and
his
what
honourable
ambition
had
he
ever
shown
calculated
to
give
me
solace
at
this
awful
time
and
make
the
association
of
his
name
with
a
damnable
crime
an
impossibility
and
an
outrage
meanwhile
my
whole
mental
vision
was
clouded
with
the
pictured
remembrances
of
your
faces
as
seen
in
childhood
in
early
youth
or
at
any
other
time
indeed
than
the
intolerable
present
george
when
he
brought
home
his
first
school
medal
leighton
when
he
denied
himself
a
new
pair
of
skates
that
he
might
give
the
money
to
a
crying
street
urchin
alfred
when
the
fever
left
him
and
his
cheeks
grew
rosy
again
with
renewed
health
all
these
young
and
innocent
faces
crowded
about
me
awakening
poignant
suggestions
of
the
change
which
a
few
short
short
years
had
wrought
in
relations
which
once
seemed
warm
and
alive
with
promise
then
a
group
of
boys
now
this
awful
question
it
was
not
till
an
hour
had
passed
that
i
remembered
that
the
phial
had
not
been
returned
to
the
cabinet
in
whose
possession
would
it
be
found
should
i
have
a
search
made
for
it
i
turned
cold
in
bed
at
the
debasing
the
intolerable
prospect
of
acting
as
detective
in
my
own
house
then
the
poisoned
glass
it
still
stood
beside
me
if
i
left
it
untouched
it
would
show
suspicion
on
my
part
and
suspicion
might
precipitate
my
doom
how
could
i
avoid
taking
it
without
raising
doubts
as
to
my
discovery
of
the
trick
which
had
been
played
so
near
me
in
the
feverish
condition
of
my
mind
but
one
plan
suggested
itself
throwing
out
my
arm
i
precipitated
the
glass
to
the
floor
over
which
i
heard
it
roll
with
extraordinary
sensations
then
i
waited
for
daybreak
in
much
the
same
condition
of
mind
in
which
a
man
awaits
his
last
hour
for
my
heart
yearned
over
my
sons
even
while
panting
under
the
consciousness
that
one
of
them
was
a
monster
of
ingratitude
and
innate
depravity
when
hewson
and
the
girls
came
down
and
i
heard
the
stir
of
life
in
the
house
i
rang
my
bell
and
asked
for
hope
she
came
in
with
beaming
face
and
a
smile
full
of
happiness
she
had
risen
from
a
beauty
sleep
and
possibly
because
my
thoughts
had
been
so
dark
i
had
never
seen
her
look
so
bright
and
lovely
but
her
cheeks
paled
as
she
approached
my
bedside
and
noticed
my
miserable
appearance
and
it
was
with
sudden
anxiety
she
cried
what
a
wretched
night
you
must
have
had
uncle
you
look
poorly
this
morning
you
should
have
sent
for
me
before
again
i
summoned
up
all
my
powers
of
acting
i
knocked
over
my
medicine
in
the
night
perhaps
that
is
why
i
look
so
wretched
i
did
not
sleep
after
four
you
can
say
so
if
any
of
the
boys
ask
after
me
at
the
breakfast
table
with
a
woman
solicitude
she
moved
around
to
my
side
where
the
screen
stood
why
what
this
she
exclaimed
stooping
as
her
foot
encountered
some
small
object
i
expected
her
to
lift
the
glass
instead
of
that
she
lifted
the
bottle
it
had
been
left
there
on
the
floor
and
not
carried
out
of
the
room
as
i
had
naturally
supposed
i
endeavoured
to
look
undisturbed
and
as
if
this
bottle
had
been
thrown
over
with
the
glass
but
i
failed
pitiably
at
the
sight
of
her
dear
womanly
face
and
the
affection
beaming
in
every
look
i
broke
down
and
raised
my
arms
imploringly
towards
her
come
to
my
arms
i
prayed
let
me
feel
one
true
head
on
my
breast
the
next
minute
i
was
conscious
of
having
said
a
word
too
much
her
look
which
you
all
know
and
love
changed
and
while
she
submitted
to
my
caresses
and
even
warmly
returned
them
it
was
with
an
appearance
of
doubt
which
i
almost
cursed
myself
for
having
roused
in
that
innocent
breast
why
one
true
heart
she
repeated
are
there
not
others
in
this
house
george
and
alfred
love
you
devotedly
and
little
claire
what
child
could
show
more
fondness
for
a
grandfather
than
she
why
had
she
not
included
leighton
i
endeavoured
to
right
myself
with
some
mechanical
phrase
or
other
but
the
attempt
was
not
very
successful
and
she
was
leaving
the
room
in
great
disturbance
when
i
called
her
hurriedly
back
i
want
you
to
smile
as
usual
i
gravely
enjoined
george
extravagances
and
alfred
caprices
are
no
new
story
to
you
i
have
been
thinking
about
them
that
is
all
but
i
had
rather
they
did
not
know
it
i
could
not
mention
leighton
name
either
meantime
she
was
standing
there
with
the
poison
bottle
in
her
hand
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
and
motioned
her
to
restore
it
to
the
cabinet
as
she
did
so
i
perceived
her
turn
with
lips
as
if
about
to
ask
some
question
but
she
either
lacked
the
courage
or
the
will
to
do
so
for
she
proceeded
to
the
cabinet
with
the
bottle
which
she
placed
quietly
on
the
shelf
but
almost
instantly
she
took
it
up
again
why
uncle
she
cried
there
is
not
as
much
here
as
there
ought
to
be
i
am
sure
the
bottle
was
half
full
last
night
and
then
i
remembered
it
was
she
who
prepared
my
medicine
for
me
and
i
left
it
on
the
shelf
she
went
on
uncle
how
came
it
to
be
lying
by
the
side
of
your
bed
did
you
try
to
strengthen
the
dose
you
know
you
ought
not
to
bennett
said
that
three
drops
in
half
a
glass
of
water
were
all
you
could
take
with
safety
i
had
not
a
word
to
say
my
mind
seemed
a
blank
and
no
excuse
presented
itself
the
wish
which
i
had
openly
cherished
of
seeing
hope
married
to
one
of
my
sons
clogged
my
faculties
my
protest
confined
itself
to
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
and
a
dubious
smile
she
was
far
from
understanding
i
think
i
will
stay
with
you
she
gently
suggested
nellie
will
bring
my
breakfast
up
with
yours
and
we
can
have
a
meal
at
your
bedside
but
this
did
not
chime
in
with
my
plans
no
said
i
nellie
can
stay
with
me
if
you
wish
but
i
want
you
to
go
down
your
cousins
will
miss
you
if
you
are
not
there
to
pour
the
coffee
for
them
alfred
shows
an
astonishing
punctuality
of
late
and
george
quite
emulates
his
younger
brother
precision
and
haste
leighton
was
never
late
her
cheek
grew
the
colour
of
a
rose
never
before
had
i
so
much
as
suggested
to
her
the
secret
wish
you
have
one
and
all
entertained
ever
since
her
beauty
and
affectionate
nature
brought
sunshine
into
this
cold
dwelling
i
was
glad
to
see
this
colour
at
the
same
time
i
was
made
poignantly
wretched
by
what
it
suggested
if
hope
loved
one
of
my
sons
and
he
should
be
the
one
who
had
i
felt
more
than
ever
called
upon
to
act
warily
here
was
someone
besides
myself
to
think
of
your
mother
is
dead
and
in
paradise
but
hope
is
young
and
the
crushing
weight
under
which
i
staggered
could
not
well
be
borne
by
her
for
her
sake
if
not
for
my
own
i
must
locate
the
that
to
my
mind
spread
defilement
over
all
my
sons
i
must
know
which
of
you
to
trust
and
which
to
fear
and
that
no
mistake
should
follow
my
attempt
at
this
i
made
haste
to
insure
that
no
warning
should
reach
you
through
any
change
in
hope
manner
so
i
reiterated
my
old
command
let
me
see
you
smile
said
i
or
i
shall
think
you
regard
me
as
being
in
worse
condition
than
i
really
am
indeed
i
am
almost
well
hope
my
disease
has
yielded
to
bennett
treatment
and
when
i
can
rise
above
these
sickly
fancies
which
are
the
effect
no
doubt
of
the
powerful
remedies
i
have
taken
i
shall
be
quite
like
my
old
self
after
breakfast
let
me
see
you
here
again
i
may
have
some
letters
requiring
an
immediate
answer
my
natural
tones
reassured
her
the
force
of
my
feelings
had
brought
some
colour
into
my
cheeks
and
i
probably
looked
less
ghastly
she
turned
away
with
a
smile
alas
her
face
renewed
its
brightness
and
shone
with
sweet
expectancy
as
she
approached
the
door
nellie
brought
me
my
breakfast
and
i
forced
myself
to
eat
it
my
mind
was
regaining
its
equilibrium
and
my
will
its
power
just
as
i
was
folding
my
napkin
hewson
came
in
he
had
brought
me
an
especial
prepared
in
the
chafing
dish
by
hope
own
hands
but
i
could
not
eat
it
the
thought
would
rise
that
she
had
seen
far
enough
into
my
mind
to
imagine
i
would
dread
eating
anything
she
had
not
cooked
for
me
herself
as
hewson
was
withdrawing
i
asked
if
you
were
all
well
his
answer
was
an
astonished
yes
at
which
i
ventured
to
remark
that
i
had
heard
someone
up
in
the
night
that
was
miss
meredith
he
explained
i
heard
her
tell
george
at
the
breakfast
table
that
she
came
down
to
your
door
about
one
in
the
morning
to
listen
if
you
were
quiet
she
said
she
found
the
gas
blown
out
in
the
hall
and
that
she
lit
it
again
i
had
left
the
open
it
do
do
these
windy
nights
sir
i
was
disturbed
by
this
discovery
that
she
should
have
been
at
the
door
at
a
moment
so
fraught
with
danger
and
misery
to
myself
was
a
thrilling
thought
besides
might
she
not
have
been
so
happy
or
so
unhappy
as
to
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
who
crept
out
of
my
a
moment
later
overcome
by
a
possibility
which
might
settle
the
whole
question
for
me
i
let
hewson
go
in
silence
and
when
hope
came
back
drew
her
gently
but
resolutely
down
on
the
bed
at
my
side
and
said
to
her
with
a
smile
i
have
just
learned
how
my
dear
girl
watches
over
her
uncle
slumbers
you
are
too
careful
of
me
i
had
rather
have
you
sleep
george
room
is
on
this
floor
let
him
come
and
see
how
i
am
in
the
night
if
you
are
so
uneasy
george
would
never
wake
up
without
assistance
said
she
i
could
not
trust
you
to
his
tender
care
well
meaning
as
he
is
leighton
then
he
a
light
sleeper
i
have
often
heard
you
say
that
you
have
heard
him
pacing
the
floor
of
his
room
as
late
as
three
in
the
morning
but
he
sleeps
better
now
alfred
might
stop
on
his
way
in
but
alfred
does
not
stay
out
as
late
as
he
used
to
he
comes
in
quite
regularly
since
you
have
been
were
her
eyes
quite
true
yes
they
were
as
true
as
the
sky
they
mirror
i
grasped
her
hand
and
ventured
upon
a
vital
question
who
was
up
at
the
same
time
you
were
last
night
i
am
sure
i
heard
a
man
step
in
the
hall
just
about
the
time
you
relighted
the
gas
did
you
know
about
the
gas
she
asked
i
found
it
smelling
dreadfully
but
i
did
encounter
anyone
in
the
hall
i
guess
you
imagined
that
uncle
perhaps
was
my
muttered
reply
as
i
wondered
how
i
was
to
ask
the
next
question
when
did
you
go
upstairs
i
finally
inquired
oh
right
away
i
did
wait
a
minute
after
i
found
you
quiet
it
was
cold
in
the
halls
hewson
had
left
the
open
and
my
trip
after
a
match
chilled
me
was
your
cousin
leighton
door
open
i
instantly
inquired
or
did
you
hear
any
door
shut
after
you
went
up
she
leaned
over
me
and
looked
anxiously
into
my
face
why
do
you
ask
so
many
questions
uncle
and
in
so
hard
a
voice
would
there
have
been
any
harm
in
my
cousins
being
up
or
in
my
running
across
one
of
them
in
the
hall
not
ordinarily
but
last
night
here
my
weakness
found
vent
i
must
share
my
secret
if
only
as
a
safeguard
i
could
not
breathe
under
the
dreadful
weight
imposed
upon
me
by
this
uncertainty
and
she
knew
i
had
some
dreadful
tale
to
tell
this
i
was
assured
of
by
the
white
line
creeping
into
view
about
her
lips
and
by
the
convulsive
clasp
with
which
she
answered
my
clutch
forgetting
her
youth
ignoring
all
the
resolves
i
had
made
in
the
secret
watches
of
the
night
i
drew
her
ear
down
to
my
mouth
and
gasped
into
it
the
few
sentences
which
revealed
the
dishonour
of
our
house
i
caught
the
thrill
of
anguish
which
went
through
her
as
i
made
plain
the
attempt
which
had
been
made
upon
my
life
and
never
shall
i
forget
her
eyes
as
she
slowly
drew
back
at
the
completion
of
my
tale
and
surveyed
me
in
the
silent
suspense
which
seemed
to
mirror
forth
my
own
deep
sons
i
could
not
answer
the
demand
made
by
that
look
nor
can
i
answer
it
now
you
all
came
in
soon
after
and
each
and
all
of
you
had
something
to
say
about
the
mischance
of
the
night
which
had
so
visibly
affected
me
and
i
did
not
dare
to
read
your
eyes
brought
face
to
face
with
you
i
seemed
to
shrink
from
rather
than
seek
for
the
settling
of
this
dreadful
question
perhaps
because
i
regard
you
with
equal
affection
perhaps
because
your
mother
picture
was
visible
over
your
heads
and
it
seemed
like
sacrilege
to
her
memory
to
consider
such
a
question
under
her
loving
and
trusting
eyes
at
all
events
you
left
me
with
my
mind
still
in
doubt
to
confront
hope
again
and
with
her
the
wretched
future
which
the
night
experience
had
unfolded
before
us
both
i
found
her
filled
with
a
confidence
i
could
not
easily
share
she
believed
in
the
integrity
of
the
man
she
held
dearest
but
she
would
not
tell
me
which
of
you
she
thus
loved
and
i
could
only
guess
but
even
this
belief
weakened
a
little
as
we
talked
together
and
i
soon
saw
by
the
arguments
she
used
that
peace
and
certainty
would
never
be
hers
again
as
long
as
a
doubt
remained
as
to
which
of
her
cousins
had
conceived
and
perpetrated
this
criminal
act
as
for
me
the
future
holds
no
comfort
i
shall
give
each
of
you
a
thousand
dollars
in
celebration
of
my
anniversary
of
marriage
and
perhaps
this
will
awaken
the
conscience
of
the
one
who
loves
my
money
better
than
my
life
then
though
i
shall
not
change
my
will
i
shall
publish
abroad
that
i
have
had
losses
which
only
a
fortunate
speculation
can
make
good
and
see
if
by
these
means
the
cupidity
which
came
near
costing
me
my
life
may
not
serve
to
insure
me
a
sufficiently
prolonged
existence
for
me
to
separate
in
my
own
mind
the
one
black
sheep
from
the
white
but
if
these
measures
fail
if
i
am
doomed
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
unknown
hand
which
i
must
henceforth
see
lifted
over
my
life
if
hope
watchfulness
and
my
own
vigilance
can
not
prevent
the
repetition
of
an
act
which
if
once
determined
upon
can
not
fail
of
fulfilment
in
a
house
like
this
then
this
letter
read
by
you
all
in
concert
must
prove
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
one
and
since
none
of
you
will
read
these
lines
except
under
these
circumstances
of
death
and
crime
i
hereby
charge
that
guilty
one
to
speak
and
as
he
hopes
to
escape
my
curse
and
the
wrath
of
an
outraged
deity
to
avow
his
crime
in
her
presence
and
in
that
of
the
two
brothers
he
will
thus
exonerate
having
done
this
he
may
take
or
leave
his
portion
of
the
estate
i
shall
be
satisfied
and
the
god
whose
commandments
he
has
doubly
defied
may
forget
to
avenge
a
crime
forgiven
by
its
object
to
my
two
sons
whose
filial
instincts
have
never
been
thus
disturbed
i
leave
my
blessing
may
all
happiness
be
theirs
whether
this
does
or
does
not
include
the
love
of
the
dear
girl
whose
future
i
have
thus
endeavoured
to
clear
archibald
gillespie
i
have
inserted
this
letter
here
that
you
may
understand
the
situation
which
ensued
upon
its
perusal
by
the
three
brothers
we
who
had
not
read
it
were
simply
startled
to
note
the
way
in
which
these
three
young
men
drew
back
as
from
a
common
centre
as
the
last
words
fell
from
leighton
paralysed
lips
then
alfred
in
a
rush
of
ferocious
passion
bounded
forward
again
and
striding
up
to
george
shouted
out
in
an
awful
voice
are
the
man
and
struck
him
without
mercy
to
the
floor
ix
the
clock
that
had
run
down
in
the
commotion
which
followed
i
noted
two
things
first
that
at
sight
of
this
violence
from
one
brother
to
the
other
leighton
drew
back
without
offering
assistance
to
the
one
or
rebuke
to
the
other
secondly
that
alfred
show
of
anger
ceased
as
soon
as
it
had
thus
expended
itself
and
that
his
next
thought
was
for
hope
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
approach
her
the
coroner
now
interfered
with
his
authority
and
all
words
were
forbidden
between
these
members
of
a
disrupted
household
till
the
police
had
finished
an
investigation
which
had
now
become
as
serious
as
the
crime
which
had
called
it
forth
the
search
was
for
the
little
phial
which
had
held
the
acid
and
when
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
investigation
would
not
cease
till
this
was
found
miss
meredith
who
had
clung
to
me
as
her
one
stay
in
this
overturning
of
every
other
natural
support
asked
me
in
agitated
tones
if
i
thought
her
cousins
would
be
subjected
to
personal
search
as
no
other
course
was
open
to
the
police
after
the
direct
accusation
which
had
just
been
made
by
the
infuriated
alfred
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
whereupon
she
attempted
to
flee
the
place
saying
she
could
not
endure
to
see
them
subjected
to
such
humiliation
but
here
alfred
as
if
divining
her
thoughts
offered
his
person
to
gryce
with
the
remark
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
look
through
my
pockets
if
you
wish
you
will
find
nothing
to
reward
your
pains
am
not
the
villain
a
growl
of
anger
bridled
but
concentrated
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
i
caught
a
sudden
glimpse
of
george
quivering
under
the
restraining
hands
of
bennett
and
sweetwater
in
a
mad
attempt
to
reach
his
brother
whom
he
seemed
to
curse
between
his
teeth
if
you
search
him
you
must
do
the
same
to
me
were
the
words
with
which
he
seasoned
this
struggle
you
will
find
nothing
more
incriminating
on
me
than
on
him
probably
less
for
my
pockets
are
always
open
while
his
a
gnash
of
his
teeth
finished
these
almost
inarticulate
phrases
he
was
not
as
easily
roused
as
his
brother
but
more
tenacious
in
his
passions
and
less
readily
appeased
peace
there
you
shall
both
be
satisfied
interposed
a
businesslike
voice
in
face
of
these
open
accusations
the
coroner
felt
himself
relieved
from
the
embarrassment
which
had
hitherto
restrained
him
and
made
no
further
effort
to
hide
his
suspicions
miss
meredith
who
unconsciously
to
herself
had
drawn
me
as
far
as
the
door
in
her
efforts
to
escape
the
disquieting
scene
she
had
herself
precipitated
paused
as
these
words
left
the
lips
and
yielding
to
the
terrible
fascination
of
the
moment
caught
my
arm
and
clinging
thus
with
both
hands
turned
her
eyes
again
upon
the
men
under
whose
roof
she
had
eaten
slept
and
loved
ay
loved
as
i
knew
by
the
tension
of
her
body
communicated
to
me
by
the
pressure
of
her
hands
suddenly
that
pressure
was
removed
her
hands
had
flown
to
her
eyes
shutting
out
the
spectacle
she
could
no
longer
confront
nor
was
it
easy
for
me
to
look
on
unmoved
or
view
with
even
an
appearance
of
equanimity
the
scene
before
me
i
have
not
mentioned
leighton
he
had
not
come
forward
with
the
other
two
but
he
allowed
his
pockets
to
be
searched
without
a
protest
when
his
turn
came
though
it
was
very
evident
that
the
proceeding
caused
him
more
suffering
and
a
keener
sensation
of
disgrace
than
it
did
the
other
two
was
this
on
account
of
the
superior
sensitiveness
of
his
nature
or
because
he
shrunk
with
a
proud
man
shame
from
the
publicity
entailed
upon
the
anomalous
articles
which
were
drawn
from
his
inner
pockets
when
some
few
minutes
later
my
eyes
fell
on
these
objects
lying
piled
on
the
library
table
i
marvelled
over
the
character
of
a
man
who
could
gather
and
retain
in
one
place
a
small
a
lock
of
woman
hair
the
programme
of
some
common
music
hall
and
a
photograph
which
after
one
glance
i
instinctively
turned
face
downwards
lest
it
should
fall
under
the
eye
of
his
cousin
whose
delicacy
could
not
fail
to
be
hurt
by
it
the
phial
had
not
been
found
on
any
of
the
young
gentlemen
when
miss
meredith
became
aware
that
the
ordeal
was
over
she
let
her
hands
drop
and
stepped
hastily
into
the
i
did
not
follow
her
but
remained
in
the
doorway
watching
the
detectives
as
they
moved
from
room
to
room
in
the
search
which
was
now
being
extended
to
all
parts
of
the
house
as
i
saw
these
men
pass
so
quietly
but
with
such
an
air
of
authority
into
rooms
where
a
few
hours
before
they
would
have
hesitated
to
put
foot
even
upon
the
genial
express
invitation
i
experienced
such
a
realisation
of
the
abyss
into
which
this
hitherto
family
had
fallen
that
i
lost
for
a
little
while
that
sense
of
personal
bitterness
which
the
predictions
evinced
by
miss
meredith
had
so
selfishly
awakened
but
to
continue
the
summary
of
events
seeing
leighton
withdraw
upstairs
followed
by
an
officer
in
plain
clothes
who
had
appeared
on
the
scene
as
if
by
magic
i
could
not
refrain
from
asking
why
he
was
allowed
to
separate
himself
from
the
others
and
was
much
moved
at
being
informed
that
he
had
gone
up
to
sit
by
his
child
bed
that
child
who
of
all
in
the
house
had
found
her
wonted
rest
that
he
could
calm
himself
down
to
such
a
task
under
the
eye
of
one
who
could
have
little
sympathy
with
his
feelings
whether
they
were
those
of
outraged
innocence
or
guilt
struck
me
as
the
most
pathetic
exhibition
of
i
had
ever
known
and
more
than
once
during
the
busy
hour
that
followed
i
was
visited
by
fleeting
visions
of
this
silent
man
sitting
out
the
night
under
the
watchful
eye
of
one
who
moved
if
he
so
much
as
lowered
his
head
to
kiss
the
only
cheek
likely
to
smile
upon
him
on
the
morrow
as
it
had
smiled
upon
him
that
the
search
for
the
missing
phial
was
likely
to
be
a
one
soon
became
apparent
to
everyone
two
men
who
had
carried
the
investigation
into
the
room
where
the
servants
had
been
shut
up
since
early
evening
came
back
with
the
report
that
nothing
had
come
to
light
in
that
quarter
at
the
same
time
two
more
returned
from
above
with
a
similar
report
in
regard
to
the
of
the
three
brothers
sweetwater
and
gryce
who
had
spent
the
last
in
the
appeared
to
have
an
equally
unsatisfactory
tale
to
tell
and
i
was
wondering
what
move
would
now
be
made
when
i
intercepted
a
glance
from
the
coroner
cast
in
the
direction
of
the
and
realised
that
the
law
was
no
respecter
of
persons
and
that
she
she
too
might
be
called
upon
to
give
proof
of
not
having
this
article
upon
her
person
the
prospect
of
such
an
indignity
offered
to
one
i
regarded
with
more
than
passing
admiration
unnerved
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
hardly
myself
when
frisbie
advanced
upon
me
with
this
remark
i
regret
the
necessity
outhwaite
but
the
emergencies
of
the
case
demand
the
same
compliance
on
your
part
as
on
that
of
the
other
gentlemen
found
upon
this
scene
of
crime
it
is
needless
to
say
that
we
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
your
integrity
but
you
were
here
when
gillespie
died
and
have
been
close
to
a
certain
member
of
this
family
many
times
since
and
in
short
it
is
a
form
which
you
as
a
lawyer
will
recognise
and
no
apologies
i
prayed
recalling
the
one
son
of
gillespie
who
had
not
been
on
the
scene
of
crime
at
the
time
of
his
father
death
an
intelligent
glance
from
the
coroner
convinced
me
that
he
was
thinking
of
him
too
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
willing
to
have
me
understand
that
he
exacted
this
thorough
search
in
order
to
fix
the
crime
on
leighton
for
if
the
phial
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
house
the
necessary
conclusion
must
be
that
it
had
been
carried
out
of
it
by
the
one
person
known
to
have
left
it
during
the
critical
preceding
gillespie
death
i
understand
your
thoughts
quoth
the
coroner
who
seemed
to
read
my
face
like
an
open
book
the
phial
may
have
been
smashed
on
the
sidewalk
or
thrown
into
some
refuse
barrel
but
that
would
be
the
unwisest
thing
a
guilty
man
could
do
for
its
odour
is
unmistakable
and
once
it
is
found
by
the
men
i
will
set
looking
for
it
at
daybreak
well
what
now
sweetwater
was
whispering
in
his
ear
the
child
do
i
remember
that
the
father
suggested
she
should
be
put
to
bed
undressed
oh
i
can
not
have
you
disturb
the
child
used
as
i
am
to
the
subterfuges
of
criminals
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
that
a
father
could
make
use
of
his
child
as
a
medium
for
his
own
safety
or
miss
meredith
the
insidious
whisperer
went
on
or
miss
meredith
she
may
have
the
bottle
on
her
own
person
but
she
would
never
pass
it
over
to
the
child
no
no
curb
your
extravagances
and
confine
your
attention
to
outhwaite
who
is
kind
enough
to
allow
us
to
inspect
his
pockets
here
the
curtain
at
the
door
was
disturbed
and
a
pallid
face
looked
forth
i
pray
you
came
in
entreaty
from
hope
set
lips
spare
this
stranger
whose
only
crime
has
been
to
show
kindness
to
a
man
he
did
not
know
in
an
extremity
he
did
not
understand
search
me
search
claire
but
do
not
subject
this
gentleman
to
an
act
so
injurious
i
swear
that
the
phial
is
not
on
him
i
swear
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
saying
the
excitements
of
the
last
two
hours
were
fast
unsettling
her
reason
she
held
out
her
hands
imploringly
i
do
know
why
i
care
so
much
she
murmured
in
fresh
expostulation
but
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
bear
it
from
that
moment
i
loved
her
though
i
knew
this
interposition
in
my
behalf
sprang
from
her
womanly
instinct
rather
than
from
the
spontaneous
impulse
of
a
freshly
awakened
heart
i
must
have
shown
how
deeply
i
was
moved
for
the
coroner
looked
distressed
though
he
gave
no
signs
of
modifying
his
intention
and
i
was
beginning
to
empty
my
pockets
before
his
eyes
when
sweetwater
expressive
countenance
showed
a
sudden
change
and
he
rushed
again
to
the
rear
here
he
stood
a
moment
before
the
door
striking
his
forehead
in
wrathful
indecision
then
he
disappeared
within
only
to
shout
aloud
in
another
instant
fool
fool
and
i
noticed
when
i
first
came
in
that
the
clock
had
stopped
see
see
we
were
at
his
side
in
an
instant
he
was
standing
by
the
mantelpiece
with
the
heavy
french
clock
tilted
up
before
our
eyes
under
it
tucked
away
in
the
space
allowed
to
the
pendulum
we
saw
a
small
homoeopathic
bottle
there
was
one
drop
of
liquid
at
the
bottom
which
even
before
gryce
lifted
the
bottle
to
his
nose
we
recognised
by
its
smell
to
be
prussic
acid
the
phial
which
had
held
the
deadly
dose
was
found
x
the
pencil
under
sweetwater
careful
guidance
the
clock
fell
slowly
back
into
place
it
was
one
of
those
solid
which
seem
to
form
part
of
the
shelf
on
which
they
stand
when
it
was
again
quite
level
he
pointed
to
its
face
the
hands
stood
at
nine
just
ten
minutes
previous
to
the
time
of
my
entering
the
house
at
what
hour
did
leighton
gillespie
go
out
he
asked
no
one
answered
before
nine
or
after
it
urged
the
coroner
consulting
the
faces
about
him
for
the
answer
he
probably
had
no
expectation
of
receiving
from
anyone
lips
leighton
all
right
cried
out
a
voice
from
the
library
i
hate
his
puritanical
ways
but
there
no
harm
in
him
it
sounded
like
alfred
but
the
impression
made
by
this
interruption
was
not
good
will
you
allow
me
to
state
a
fact
ventured
miss
meredith
coming
impulsively
forward
if
you
hope
to
establish
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
anyone
by
the
time
marked
by
these
hands
you
will
make
a
mistake
the
clock
has
been
out
of
order
for
some
days
yesterday
it
ran
down
i
heard
my
uncle
say
that
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
tiffany
for
repairs
fetch
in
the
butler
or
whoever
has
charge
of
this
room
ordered
frisbie
let
none
of
you
attempt
to
speak
while
he
is
present
i
wish
to
interrogate
him
myself
and
will
have
no
interruptions
we
all
drew
back
and
silence
reigned
in
the
spacious
apartment
which
lit
up
as
for
a
dinner
party
was
yet
in
such
a
state
of
disorder
that
the
orderly
old
butler
groaned
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
rugs
the
overturned
chairs
and
the
great
table
stacked
with
fine
china
and
taken
from
the
buffet
and
closets
oh
what
shall
i
do
here
he
grumbled
what
would
master
he
did
not
finish
but
we
all
understood
him
the
coroner
pointed
to
the
clock
when
was
this
wound
last
the
old
man
stared
at
the
mumbled
and
shook
his
head
then
his
eyes
fell
on
miss
meredith
i
do
remember
he
protested
it
has
not
been
running
for
days
has
it
miss
i
have
had
to
use
my
watch
in
order
to
be
on
time
with
the
meals
why
do
you
ask
sir
he
was
not
answered
this
repeated
closing
up
of
every
avenue
of
inquiry
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
the
police
gillespie
looked
very
sober
very
sober
indeed
when
he
found
he
had
to
drink
his
wine
alone
continued
the
butler
with
a
melancholy
emphasis
calculated
to
draw
our
attention
back
to
the
scene
which
had
manifestly
made
such
an
impression
upon
him
he
lifted
up
his
glass
and
held
it
out
a
long
while
before
he
drank
it
i
think
he
looked
at
each
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
in
turn
but
i
did
care
to
watch
him
too
closely
for
there
was
something
solemn
about
him
which
made
me
feel
queer
living
so
long
as
i
have
in
the
family
and
with
every
one
of
these
young
gentlemen
babies
in
arms
when
i
came
here
he
drank
it
finally
standing
but
there
was
no
harm
in
that
glass
sirs
for
i
finished
the
bottle
myself
afterwards
and
i
am
well
as
you
see
more
the
pity
shut
up
shouted
an
angry
voice
from
across
the
hall
you
are
making
a
mess
of
the
whole
affair
with
your
confounded
drivel
the
coroner
motioned
the
butler
away
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
had
now
become
oppressive
even
to
me
and
for
the
first
time
i
experienced
a
desire
to
be
quit
of
it
and
would
certainly
have
made
some
movement
towards
departure
had
it
not
been
for
my
dread
of
leaving
miss
meredith
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
meanwhile
the
coroner
was
issuing
his
orders
dakin
request
the
gentlemen
upstairs
to
come
down
again
for
a
few
minutes
bennett
the
body
of
your
patient
can
now
be
moved
ah
here
we
are
again
he
exclaimed
as
leighton
was
heard
descending
the
stairs
now
if
the
two
other
sons
of
the
deceased
will
attend
to
my
words
for
a
moment
i
will
state
that
under
the
existing
circumstances
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
call
a
jury
and
hold
an
inquest
over
remains
the
phial
smelling
of
prussic
acid
having
been
found
in
the
i
shall
only
require
restraint
put
upon
the
movements
of
the
two
sons
of
gillespie
who
are
known
to
have
entered
this
room
during
the
hour
when
this
fatal
dose
was
administered
the
one
called
alfred
having
remained
above
is
for
the
present
free
from
suspicion
i
would
be
glad
to
show
the
same
consideration
to
the
others
but
the
facts
demand
a
severity
which
i
hope
future
developments
will
allow
us
to
confine
to
the
guilty
party
outhwaite
i
must
request
you
to
hold
yourself
subject
to
my
summons
miss
meredith
i
advise
you
to
hold
no
communication
with
your
cousins
till
this
matter
shows
a
clearer
aspect
he
was
moving
off
when
alfred
who
had
been
shifting
uneasily
under
george
eye
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
i
do
want
any
discrimination
made
between
my
brothers
and
myself
i
may
be
quite
conscious
of
my
own
innocence
but
i
can
not
accept
any
show
of
favours
founded
on
a
misconception
if
george
and
leighton
are
to
be
subjected
to
surveillance
on
account
of
entering
the
this
evening
then
i
want
to
be
put
under
surveillance
too
for
i
was
in
that
room
as
well
as
they
searching
for
a
small
gold
pencil
which
i
had
dropped
from
my
pocket
at
this
acknowledgment
made
under
such
circumstances
and
against
such
odds
was
calculated
to
enlist
sympathy
and
my
heart
warmed
towards
the
man
who
in
the
heat
of
anger
could
strike
a
brother
to
the
ground
but
scorned
at
a
less
angry
moment
to
take
refuge
in
a
misunderstanding
which
left
that
brother
at
a
disadvantage
but
the
imperturbability
of
the
elderly
detective
who
at
that
moment
found
something
to
interest
him
in
the
chasing
on
a
chinese
gong
hanging
from
a
bracket
in
the
hall
warned
me
not
to
be
too
quick
with
my
sympathies
kindly
as
he
beamed
upon
this
favoured
object
of
his
attention
i
saw
that
he
took
little
stock
in
the
generous
attitude
assumed
by
gillespie
youngest
son
and
my
attention
being
attracted
to
his
movements
i
was
happily
glancing
his
way
when
he
suddenly
approached
alfred
with
what
looked
like
an
empty
tumbler
in
his
hand
is
this
the
article
you
refer
to
he
asked
and
then
we
saw
that
the
tumbler
was
not
empty
that
it
held
a
small
object
standing
upright
in
it
and
that
this
object
was
a
gold
pencil
yes
that
is
my
pencil
alfred
acknowledged
but
oh
i
am
accountable
for
putting
it
into
the
tumbler
the
old
man
admitted
the
tumbler
was
a
clean
one
gillespie
i
assure
you
i
examined
it
closely
before
making
it
a
receptacle
for
this
pencil
but
the
pencil
itself
let
me
ask
you
to
put
your
nose
to
it
mr
gillespie
it
was
a
suggestion
capable
of
but
one
interpretation
alfred
started
back
his
eyes
staring
his
features
convulsed
then
he
bent
impulsively
forward
and
put
his
nose
to
the
object
gryce
held
out
with
what
result
was
evident
from
the
sudden
damp
which
broke
out
on
his
forehead
xi
something
to
think
about
fatality
exclaimed
alfred
and
raising
his
head
he
strode
impetuously
towards
miss
meredith
you
have
enjoined
a
confession
of
guilt
and
forbidden
us
to
assert
our
innocence
he
cried
but
i
shall
assert
mine
now
and
always
whatever
happens
and
whoever
suffers
i
should
not
be
worthy
of
the
happiness
i
aim
at
if
i
did
not
declare
my
guiltlessness
in
the
face
of
facts
which
seem
to
militate
against
me
i
believe
you
she
began
her
hand
trembling
towards
his
but
the
confiding
impulse
was
stayed
by
what
thought
by
what
dread
and
her
hand
fell
and
her
lips
closed
before
she
had
completed
the
sentence
i
am
innocent
he
repeated
drawing
himself
up
in
proud
assertion
nobly
borne
out
by
the
clear
regard
of
the
eye
which
now
turned
alternately
on
george
and
leighton
who
were
standing
upon
either
side
of
him
what
is
the
use
of
repeating
a
phrase
you
can
not
back
up
with
proof
called
out
george
who
was
still
gnawing
his
own
special
grievance
i
am
as
innocent
as
you
are
but
i
scorn
to
take
advantage
of
each
and
every
opportunity
to
assert
it
leighton
neither
spoke
nor
moved
the
melancholy
in
which
he
was
now
completely
lost
repelled
all
attempt
to
break
it
nor
did
this
expression
of
complete
wretchedness
alter
during
the
hubbub
that
followed
when
it
did
but
i
must
make
clear
the
circumstances
of
this
change
i
was
engaged
in
making
my
adieux
to
miss
meredith
when
sweetwater
after
a
marked
effort
to
meet
my
eye
motioned
me
to
join
him
in
the
doorway
of
the
den
where
gillespie
body
still
lay
not
enjoying
the
summons
yet
feeling
it
impossible
to
slight
them
i
ventured
for
the
last
time
or
so
i
hoped
down
the
hall
the
young
detective
was
looking
into
the
room
which
had
already
played
so
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
events
of
the
night
and
as
i
drew
up
beside
him
i
perceived
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
not
upon
the
figure
of
its
late
occupant
but
on
the
face
and
form
of
leighton
gillespie
who
was
bending
above
it
for
all
the
humiliation
i
felt
at
thus
sharing
the
professional
surveillance
entered
into
by
this
able
young
detective
i
could
not
resist
following
his
glance
which
seemed
to
find
something
remarkable
in
the
attitude
or
expression
of
the
man
before
me
the
result
was
a
similar
interest
on
my
part
and
a
score
of
new
surmises
the
melancholy
which
up
till
now
had
been
the
predominating
characteristic
of
this
inscrutable
face
had
yielded
to
what
could
not
be
called
a
smile
and
yet
was
strangely
like
one
and
this
smile
or
shadow
of
a
smile
had
in
it
just
that
tinge
of
sarcasm
which
made
it
the
one
look
of
all
others
least
to
be
expected
from
a
son
who
in
common
with
his
brothers
laboured
under
a
suspicion
of
having
been
the
direct
cause
of
his
father
death
with
the
memory
of
it
fixed
indelibly
in
my
mind
i
moved
away
and
in
another
moment
was
quit
of
the
house
in
which
i
had
spent
four
hours
of
extraordinary
suspense
and
exciting
adventure
as
i
passed
down
the
stoop
i
met
a
young
man
coming
up
he
was
the
first
of
the
army
of
reporters
destined
to
besiege
that
house
before
daybreak
xii
gossip
next
morning
i
routed
up
sam
underhill
at
an
early
hour
sam
underhill
is
my
special
friend
he
is
also
my
nearest
neighbour
his
apartment
being
directly
under
my
own
he
is
a
lazy
chap
and
i
found
him
abed
and
none
too
well
pleased
at
being
disturbed
what
the
dickens
brings
you
here
at
this
unearthly
hour
was
the
amiable
greeting
i
received
i
waited
till
he
had
made
himself
comfortable
again
then
i
boldly
stated
you
are
a
sam
and
consequently
well
up
in
the
gossip
of
the
day
what
can
you
tell
me
about
the
gillespies
the
three
young
men
i
mean
sons
of
archibald
gillespie
george
alfred
and
leighton
what
possible
interest
can
you
have
in
them
rich
fellows
spendthrifts
every
one
of
them
what
have
they
been
up
to
that
you
should
rout
me
up
at
this
hour
for
reply
i
opened
out
the
morning
paper
which
i
had
been
careful
to
bring
along
see
here
i
cried
gillespie
the
broker
died
suddenly
last
night
from
the
effects
of
some
drug
mysteriously
administered
i
was
reading
rapidly
anxious
to
see
what
kind
of
a
story
the
reporters
had
made
of
it
had
been
ill
for
some
weeks
back
but
seemed
perfectly
restored
up
to
nine
last
evening
when
he
fell
and
died
without
warning
in
the
small
room
known
as
his
den
a
bottle
of
chloral
was
found
on
the
mantel
but
there
is
no
proof
that
he
took
any
of
it
indeed
his
symptoms
were
such
that
the
action
of
a
much
more
violent
drug
is
suspected
his
little
grandchild
was
a
witness
to
his
last
moments
george
leighton
and
alfred
are
now
more
than
rich
fellows
they
are
rich
men
i
suggested
relieved
that
my
name
had
not
appeared
in
the
headlines
they
need
to
be
was
the
short
reply
one
of
them
at
least
stood
in
great
need
of
money
which
i
asked
with
an
odd
sensation
of
choking
in
my
throat
george
he
about
played
out
as
i
take
it
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
has
lost
in
unfortunate
bets
thirty
thousand
dollars
since
summer
set
in
he
has
a
mania
for
betting
and
and
as
his
father
had
little
patience
with
vices
of
this
nature
their
relations
of
late
have
been
more
than
strained
but
he
a
mighty
fellow
for
all
that
and
a
great
favourite
with
the
men
who
do
play
with
him
i
heard
he
was
going
to
be
married
that
and
this
sudden
windfall
may
set
him
straight
again
he
a
handsome
fellow
did
you
ever
meet
him
once
i
acknowledged
then
with
an
effort
of
which
i
was
more
or
less
ashamed
i
asked
the
name
of
the
girl
who
was
willing
to
take
such
a
spendthrift
for
a
husband
sam
did
not
seem
to
be
as
well
posted
on
this
point
as
on
some
others
i
have
heard
her
name
he
admitted
some
cousin
who
lives
in
the
same
house
with
him
the
old
gentleman
fancied
her
so
much
he
promised
to
give
a
big
fortune
to
the
son
who
married
her
it
seems
that
george
is
likely
to
be
the
lucky
one
strange
what
odd
things
come
up
in
families
there
is
another
brother
alfred
i
think
they
call
him
oh
alph
he
a
deuced
handsome
chap
too
but
not
such
a
universal
favourite
as
george
more
moral
though
i
think
his
sole
vice
is
an
inordinate
love
of
doing
nothing
i
have
known
him
to
lie
out
half
the
night
on
a
saying
nothing
doing
nothing
not
even
smoking
i
have
sometimes
wondered
if
he
ate
opium
on
the
sly
life
would
be
stupid
as
he
spends
it
if
dreams
did
not
take
the
place
of
the
pleasant
realities
he
scorns
i
must
have
shown
my
amazement
this
was
not
the
alfred
gillespie
i
had
met
the
night
before
i
have
heard
that
everything
was
not
quite
smooth
with
him
i
know
i
have
seen
him
around
lately
crushing
pillows
and
making
us
all
look
vulgar
in
contrast
to
his
calm
and
almost
insulting
impassibility
i
wonder
what
he
will
do
with
the
three
or
four
millions
which
will
fall
to
his
share
marry
i
suggested
fillipping
a
fly
from
my
he
alph
i
do
believe
he
could
hold
himself
erect
long
enough
to
go
through
the
ceremony
besides
it
would
be
such
a
bore
that
my
idea
of
alph
it
was
not
mine
either
he
had
greatly
changed
or
sam
knowledge
of
him
was
of
the
most
superficial
character
as
i
wavered
between
these
two
conclusions
i
began
to
experience
a
vague
sensation
of
dread
if
love
could
effect
such
a
transformation
in
so
unlikely
a
subject
as
the
man
we
were
discussing
what
might
it
not
effect
in
an
ardent
nature
like
my
own
i
hastened
to
change
the
subject
the
third
brother
is
already
married
i
believe
leighton
oh
he
a
widower
has
been
a
widower
for
years
he
was
unfortunate
in
the
marriage
he
made
after
the
first
year
no
one
ever
saw
young
gillespie
in
public
i
do
think
the
old
gentleman
ever
forgave
him
that
match
what
was
the
trouble
he
seems
to
have
a
dear
little
girl
i
saw
her
when
i
saw
her
uncle
oh
the
child
she
well
enough
but
the
mother
was
well
we
will
be
charitable
and
say
erratic
common
stock
i
heard
no
mate
at
all
for
a
man
like
him
not
that
he
any
too
good
either
for
all
his
hypocritical
ways
i
have
no
use
for
leighton
i
can
not
abide
philanthropic
men
whose
noses
are
always
in
the
gutter
a
sneak
is
leighton
and
so
inconsistent
one
day
you
hear
of
him
presiding
at
some
charity
meeting
the
next
night
you
find
him
behind
the
scenes
at
a
variety
theatre
and
as
for
money
not
one
of
gillespie
sons
spends
so
much
he
has
just
drained
the
old
purse
or
so
i
heard
and
when
asked
to
give
an
account
of
himself
mentions
his
charities
and
many
schemes
of
benevolence
as
if
the
old
man
himself
did
spend
thousands
in
just
such
lines
he
does
look
like
a
prig
i
ventured
oh
he
looks
well
enough
but
there
something
wrong
about
the
man
his
own
folks
acknowledge
it
something
shameful
furtive
something
which
will
not
bear
the
light
none
of
those
boys
are
chips
of
the
old
block
let
see
the
paper
what
are
you
holding
it
off
for
anything
more
about
gillespie
death
do
they
call
it
suicide
that
would
be
a
sad
ending
to
such
a
successful
life
one
question
first
was
gillespie
a
good
man
he
was
rich
yet
had
few
if
any
calumniators
i
handed
him
the
paper
there
were
some
startling
lines
below
those
i
had
read
out
so
glibly
they
do
not
stop
at
suicide
i
remarked
murder
is
suggested
the
drug
was
not
administered
by
himself
oh
protested
sam
running
his
eye
over
the
lines
that
were
destined
to
startle
all
new
york
that
morning
this
wo
do
none
of
those
boys
are
bad
enough
for
that
not
even
leighton
you
dislike
leighton
i
remarked
he
did
not
reply
he
had
just
come
upon
my
name
in
the
article
he
was
reading
look
here
he
cried
you
a
close
one
how
came
you
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
affair
i
see
your
name
here
read
he
complied
with
an
eagerness
which
i
suppose
but
faintly
mirrored
that
of
half
the
readers
that
morning
what
he
read
i
leave
to
your
imagination
merely
premising
that
no
new
facts
had
come
to
light
since
my
departure
from
the
house
and
the
printing
of
the
paper
when
he
had
finished
he
bestowed
upon
me
a
long
and
scrutinising
look
this
knocks
me
out
said
he
with
more
force
than
elegance
i
would
never
have
believed
it
never
of
any
of
these
men
then
with
a
sudden
change
quite
characteristic
he
ejaculated
it
was
a
rum
chance
for
you
arthur
how
did
you
like
it
i
refused
to
discuss
this
side
of
the
question
i
was
afraid
of
disclosing
what
had
become
the
secret
of
my
heart
he
did
not
notice
my
reticence
this
too
was
like
him
but
remarked
with
visible
reluctance
the
weight
of
evidence
seems
to
be
against
alph
poor
alph
so
this
is
the
result
of
those
long
unbroken
hours
of
silent
dreaming
i
shall
never
trust
a
lazy
man
again
when
they
do
bestir
themselves
he
has
not
been
arrested
yet
i
interjected
dryly
till
the
police
show
absolute
belief
in
his
guilt
i
for
one
shall
hold
my
tongue
poor
alph
was
all
the
reply
i
received
xiii
indications
these
concluding
words
of
sam
underhill
show
the
trend
of
public
opinion
at
this
time
but
i
was
not
swayed
by
the
general
prejudice
nor
to
all
appearance
were
the
police
though
enough
poison
was
found
in
gillespie
remains
to
have
caused
the
death
of
any
ordinary
man
in
fifteen
minutes
no
arrests
were
made
nor
was
gillespie
favourite
son
subjected
to
any
closer
surveillance
than
the
other
members
of
this
once
highly
respected
family
meanwhile
the
papers
were
filled
with
gossip
about
the
case
which
was
now
openly
regarded
as
one
of
murder
in
one
column
i
read
a
account
of
how
george
gillespie
actually
once
won
a
bet
in
face
of
all
odds
and
to
the
confounding
of
those
who
trusted
in
his
invariable
and
in
another
how
leighton
had
worn
out
his
father
patience
by
a
most
persistent
association
with
the
most
degraded
classes
an
association
which
led
him
into
all
sorts
of
extravagances
as
a
sample
of
these
and
to
show
how
entirely
his
follies
differed
from
those
of
his
elder
brother
he
has
been
known
to
order
breakfast
at
a
restaurant
and
disappear
in
the
wake
of
a
salvation
army
procession
before
the
meal
could
be
served
they
never
knew
at
home
when
to
expect
him
in
or
at
what
moment
he
might
leave
the
family
circle
he
was
so
restless
he
rarely
sat
an
evening
out
in
any
one
place
without
any
apparent
reason
he
would
often
leave
in
the
midst
of
concert
sermon
or
lecture
and
has
been
known
more
than
once
to
dash
away
from
a
theatrical
performance
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
his
reaching
the
open
air
and
he
never
expected
to
be
criticised
or
questioned
if
he
were
he
found
some
apology
to
suit
the
occasion
but
the
apology
was
forced
and
the
person
who
called
it
forth
rarely
repeated
the
offence
only
a
small
paragraph
was
devoted
to
alfred
in
it
his
temporary
engagement
to
miss
saxton
of
baltimore
was
mentioned
and
a
somewhat
cruel
account
given
of
the
way
he
jilted
this
young
lady
on
his
return
to
the
city
as
this
was
coincident
with
the
arrival
of
hope
at
her
uncle
house
i
needed
no
further
explanation
of
his
fickleness
all
this
gossip
about
people
in
whom
i
had
come
to
take
so
deep
an
interest
both
worried
and
unsettled
me
and
i
found
myself
looking
forward
with
mingled
dread
and
expectation
to
the
public
inquiry
which
i
had
every
reason
to
hope
would
separate
some
of
these
threads
in
the
network
of
which
my
own
heart
had
become
so
unfortunately
entangled
it
had
been
called
for
thursday
and
when
that
day
came
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
appear
upon
the
scene
not
a
word
of
what
passed
escaped
me
not
a
look
nor
a
sign
miss
meredith
who
entered
on
the
arm
of
leighton
wore
a
veil
thick
enough
to
conceal
her
features
but
i
did
not
need
to
pierce
that
veil
to
imagine
the
expression
of
anxiety
and
distress
she
thus
concealed
from
the
crowd
george
who
had
resumed
his
usual
manner
sat
conspicuous
in
height
and
good
looks
among
a
group
of
witnesses
some
of
whom
i
knew
and
some
not
bennett
sat
at
my
side
and
had
so
little
to
say
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
disturb
him
having
respect
for
the
grief
with
which
he
regarded
the
untimely
end
of
his
friend
and
patient
the
first
witness
was
myself
as
my
testimony
contained
nothing
which
has
not
been
already
very
fully
related
in
these
pages
i
will
pass
over
this
portion
of
the
scene
with
the
single
remark
that
in
the
course
of
my
whole
examination
which
was
a
lengthy
and
exhaustive
one
i
allowed
no
expression
to
escape
me
likely
to
prejudice
the
minds
of
those
about
me
against
any
one
of
gillespie
sons
for
it
was
apparent
before
i
had
been
upon
the
stand
ten
minutes
that
an
effort
was
being
made
to
fix
the
crime
on
alfred
and
what
surety
could
i
have
that
this
result
would
not
plunge
a
barbed
arrow
into
the
breast
of
her
about
whom
my
fancy
had
drawn
its
magic
circle
as
i
sat
down
i
glanced
her
way
and
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
meaning
in
the
slight
acknowledgment
she
made
me
with
her
ungloved
hand
but
what
meaning
the
inquiry
thus
being
opened
and
curiosity
roused
as
to
the
motive
which
led
gillespie
to
summon
a
stranger
to
his
side
at
a
moment
so
vital
and
under
circumstances
seemingly
calling
for
the
ministrations
of
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
various
experts
and
physicians
were
called
to
prove
that
his
death
had
not
been
caused
by
disease
but
by
the
action
of
prussic
acid
on
a
sufficiently
healthy
system
with
the
establishment
of
this
fact
the
morning
inquiry
closed
as
miss
meredith
was
likely
to
be
the
first
witness
called
at
the
afternoon
session
i
felt
it
my
duty
as
her
lawyer
to
approach
her
at
this
time
with
the
following
question
quite
customary
under
the
circumstances
miss
meredith
said
i
you
will
probably
soon
be
subjected
to
a
searching
inquiry
by
the
coroner
may
i
ask
if
there
is
any
special
point
or
topic
concerning
which
you
would
prefer
to
keep
silence
if
so
i
can
insist
upon
your
privilege
the
look
of
mingled
surprise
and
indignation
with
which
she
regarded
me
was
a
sufficient
answer
in
itself
yet
she
chose
to
say
and
say
coldly
after
a
moment
of
reflection
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
he
can
ask
no
question
i
shall
not
be
perfectly
willing
to
answer
abashed
by
the
construction
she
had
put
upon
my
words
as
well
as
greatly
hurt
by
her
manner
i
bowed
and
drew
off
evidently
she
had
felt
her
candour
impugned
and
her
innocence
questioned
and
in
her
ignorance
of
legal
proceedings
thought
she
had
only
to
speak
the
truth
to
sustain
herself
in
my
eyes
and
in
those
of
the
crowd
assembled
to
hear
her
this
sort
of
is
common
in
witnesses
especially
in
such
as
are
more
conscious
of
their
integrity
than
of
the
pitfalls
underlying
the
simplest
inquiry
and
however
much
i
might
deplore
her
and
wish
that
she
had
better
understood
both
myself
and
her
own
position
it
was
plain
that
in
the
light
of
what
had
just
passed
between
us
all
interference
on
my
part
would
be
regarded
by
her
as
an
insult
and
that
i
would
be
expected
to
keep
silence
under
all
circumstances
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
would
it
was
an
outlook
far
from
agreeable
either
for
the
lawyer
or
lover
and
the
recess
which
now
ensued
was
passed
by
me
in
a
state
of
dread
of
which
she
in
her
inexperience
had
little
idea
upon
the
reseating
of
the
jury
her
name
just
as
i
had
anticipated
was
the
first
one
called
the
emotions
with
which
i
saw
her
rise
and
throw
aside
her
veil
under
the
concentrated
gaze
of
the
unsympathetic
crowd
convened
to
hear
her
testimony
first
revealed
to
me
the
absoluteness
of
her
hold
upon
me
and
when
i
heard
the
buzz
of
admiration
which
followed
the
disclosure
of
her
features
i
was
conscious
of
colouring
so
deeply
that
i
feared
my
secret
would
become
the
common
property
of
the
crowd
but
the
spell
created
by
her
beauty
still
held
and
all
regards
remained
fixed
upon
her
countenance
now
eloquent
with
feelings
which
for
the
moment
were
shared
by
all
who
looked
upon
her
her
voice
when
she
spoke
deepened
the
effect
of
her
presence
it
was
of
that
fine
and
resonant
quality
which
awakens
an
echo
in
all
sensitive
hearts
and
carries
conviction
with
it
even
to
the
most
callous
and
prejudiced
it
lost
some
of
its
power
perhaps
as
the
ear
became
accustomed
to
it
but
to
the
very
end
of
her
testimony
i
noted
here
and
there
persons
who
looked
up
every
time
she
spoke
as
if
some
inner
chord
responded
to
her
tones
tones
which
more
than
her
face
conveyed
the
impression
of
a
nature
exceedingly
deep
and
exquisitely
sensitive
she
meantime
failed
to
realise
the
effect
which
her
appearance
had
produced
she
had
been
questioned
and
was
striving
earnestly
and
conscientiously
to
do
justice
to
her
oath
and
relate
as
circumstantially
as
possible
what
she
knew
of
her
uncle
sudden
death
this
is
what
i
heard
her
say
i
was
my
uncle
typewriter
i
assisted
him
often
with
his
correspondence
and
was
accustomed
to
go
in
and
out
of
his
study
as
if
it
were
my
own
room
on
this
night
i
had
written
several
letters
for
him
and
being
tired
had
gone
upstairs
for
a
little
rest
but
i
was
too
anxious
to
be
of
assistance
to
him
his
mail
that
evening
was
unusually
large
to
retire
without
one
more
effort
to
relieve
him
so
i
went
down
again
a
little
after
ten
i
had
heard
steps
in
the
hall
a
few
minutes
before
and
little
claire
voice
somewhere
about
the
house
but
i
did
not
encounter
anyone
in
going
down
perhaps
because
i
went
by
the
way
of
the
rear
stairs
as
i
often
do
when
i
am
in
a
hurry
little
little
did
i
imagine
what
was
before
me
when
i
reached
my
uncle
door
but
you
know
what
a
terrible
sight
met
me
there
lay
my
kind
my
good
we
all
waited
our
hearts
in
our
mouths
but
in
a
moment
more
she
choked
down
her
emotion
and
was
ready
to
go
on
he
was
dead
i
knew
it
at
first
glance
yet
i
raised
no
cry
i
could
not
i
seemed
in
an
instant
to
have
become
marble
i
saw
him
lying
at
my
feet
and
did
not
weep
a
tear
i
did
not
even
touch
him
i
merely
staggered
to
the
table
at
the
side
of
which
he
had
fallen
and
mechanically
but
with
a
stoppage
of
my
heart
action
which
made
the
instant
one
of
untold
horror
to
me
lifted
the
carriage
of
the
typewriter
which
he
had
evidently
been
using
when
struck
with
death
and
looked
to
see
what
his
last
words
had
been
i
had
reason
for
believing
that
they
would
convey
some
warning
to
me
or
at
least
an
explanation
of
his
sudden
death
and
they
did
or
so
i
interpreted
the
isolated
phrase
i
came
upon
at
the
end
of
the
unfinished
letter
i
found
there
god
knows
i
may
have
been
mistaken
as
to
what
those
five
words
meant
but
i
was
so
impressed
with
the
belief
that
they
were
added
there
for
my
personal
enlightenment
that
i
reeled
under
the
responsibility
thus
forced
upon
me
and
hardly
conscious
of
what
i
was
doing
tore
off
with
almost
criminal
haste
the
portion
containing
these
words
and
fled
with
them
out
of
the
sight
and
reach
of
everyone
in
the
house
it
was
a
mad
thing
to
do
and
i
speedily
regretted
the
insane
impulse
which
had
actuated
me
for
i
was
very
soon
discovered
in
the
remote
spot
to
which
i
had
fled
and
the
piece
of
paper
was
found
and
and
how
could
she
be
expected
to
go
on
have
we
that
piece
of
paper
here
asked
the
coroner
it
was
produced
identified
and
passed
down
to
the
jury
it
was
my
opinion
at
the
time
and
is
still
that
she
told
her
story
thus
fully
in
order
to
elude
the
questions
which
any
apparent
reticence
on
her
part
would
assuredly
have
evoked
but
having
reached
this
point
it
seemed
impossible
for
her
to
go
farther
she
drooped
not
under
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
but
under
the
fixed
gaze
of
her
three
cousins
had
she
hoped
for
some
signs
of
sympathy
from
them
which
she
failed
to
receive
or
at
least
a
partial
recognition
on
their
part
of
the
suffering
she
was
undergoing
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
if
so
no
such
recognition
came
george
fine
face
showed
anger
and
anger
only
leighton
a
cold
impassibility
which
might
have
passed
for
the
stolidity
of
an
utterly
unfeeling
man
if
his
hands
had
not
betrayed
his
inner
restlessness
and
torment
while
alfred
flashing
eye
and
set
lips
made
plain
the
fact
that
his
emotions
clung
to
his
own
position
rather
than
to
hers
as
was
natural
perhaps
with
that
slip
of
paper
going
the
rounds
of
the
jury
and
calling
up
from
that
respectable
body
startled
uneasy
or
menacing
looks
according
to
the
nature
of
the
man
examining
it
you
remember
that
slip
a
business
communication
broken
into
by
these
totally
irrelevant
words
one
of
my
sons
he
is
it
any
wonder
that
these
twelve
commonplace
men
keenly
felt
their
position
in
face
of
what
looked
like
a
direct
accusation
from
the
father
hand
yet
as
these
five
words
simple
in
themselves
and
gaining
meaning
only
from
the
effort
which
this
young
girl
had
made
to
suppress
them
were
capable
of
being
construed
in
a
hundred
different
ways
the
faces
which
at
first
blush
mirrored
but
one
thought
gradually
assumed
a
aspect
which
would
have
been
more
encouraging
to
the
men
thus
compromised
if
the
facts
still
to
be
brought
out
in
explanation
of
miss
meredith
conduct
towards
them
had
not
been
of
so
damaging
a
character
hope
who
surmised
if
she
did
not
know
the
contents
of
the
letter
she
now
heard
rustling
in
the
coroner
hand
awaited
his
next
question
with
evident
perturbation
alfred
who
may
have
hoped
that
this
letter
would
not
appear
so
early
in
the
examination
forgot
himself
for
a
moment
and
cast
a
look
at
his
brothers
which
they
took
pains
to
ignore
perhaps
because
of
the
effort
it
cost
them
to
preserve
their
own
countenances
in
face
of
the
impending
ordeal
i
was
witness
both
to
this
appeal
and
its
rebuff
but
to
all
appearance
frisbie
saw
neither
he
was
deciding
with
what
form
of
words
to
introduce
his
new
subject
miss
meredith
he
said
at
last
you
will
now
take
this
letter
in
your
own
hand
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
yes
sir
it
was
a
letter
which
was
entrusted
to
me
by
my
uncle
and
which
i
was
told
to
preserve
in
secrecy
so
long
as
he
retained
his
health
and
life
it
is
addressed
as
all
may
see
my
three
sons
george
leighton
and
alfred
miss
meredith
did
you
understand
by
these
words
that
the
enclosed
was
intended
equally
for
your
three
cousins
yes
sir
my
uncle
archibald
told
me
so
he
expressly
said
in
giving
it
into
my
charge
that
in
the
event
of
his
sudden
or
unexplainable
death
his
three
sons
were
to
read
this
letter
together
it
has
been
opened
i
see
is
that
a
sign
it
has
been
so
delivered
and
read
yes
sir
when
on
the
night
i
made
that
inconsiderate
attempt
to
suppress
the
slip
of
paper
on
which
my
uncle
had
transcribed
the
five
words
you
have
just
shown
to
the
jury
one
of
my
cousins
reproached
me
with
having
drawn
erroneous
and
unwarrantable
conclusions
from
what
was
there
written
i
justified
myself
by
handing
over
this
letter
though
i
was
never
shown
its
contents
i
was
well
aware
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
written
and
and
i
was
certain
it
would
prove
my
best
excuse
for
what
would
otherwise
have
seemed
monstrous
in
one
who
she
was
too
disturbed
to
proceed
the
coroner
looked
at
her
kindly
but
it
was
no
part
of
his
duty
to
allow
any
sympathy
he
might
feel
for
the
witness
to
interfere
with
his
endeavour
to
reach
the
truth
he
therefore
urged
her
to
relate
the
circumstances
to
which
she
alluded
in
other
words
to
explain
how
this
letter
addressed
collectively
to
her
three
cousins
came
to
be
written
she
grew
still
more
distressed
does
not
the
letter
explain
itself
she
remonstrated
spare
me
i
pray
my
uncle
sons
have
been
brothers
to
me
do
not
make
me
repeat
what
passed
between
my
uncle
and
myself
on
that
unhappy
morning
when
he
first
unburdened
himself
of
his
intolerable
grief
i
fear
that
i
can
not
spare
you
replied
the
coroner
but
i
will
grant
you
a
short
respite
while
this
letter
or
such
portions
of
it
as
bear
upon
gillespie
death
is
being
read
to
the
jury
gentlemen
it
is
written
in
gillespie
own
hand
and
it
is
dated
just
a
month
prior
to
his
unhappy
demise
miss
meredith
you
may
sit
she
fell
rather
than
sank
into
the
chair
offered
her
and
for
a
moment
i
felt
myself
the
prey
of
a
boundless
indignation
as
i
witnessed
the
callousness
shown
towards
her
by
the
three
men
who
up
to
this
time
had
presumably
regarded
her
with
more
or
less
affection
to
me
her
position
called
for
their
especial
sympathy
the
heroism
she
evinced
was
the
heroism
of
a
loving
woman
who
sacrifices
herself
and
what
is
dearest
to
her
to
her
idea
of
justice
and
law
and
while
such
action
may
be
easy
for
a
man
it
is
hard
beyond
expression
for
a
woman
who
as
we
know
is
much
more
apt
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
her
heart
than
to
any
abstract
appeal
of
right
and
justice
yet
these
same
relatives
of
hers
sat
still
and
scarcely
looked
her
way
though
she
glanced
repeatedly
and
with
heartrending
appeal
in
their
direction
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
i
was
too
prejudiced
a
witness
to
be
just
to
these
men
had
i
not
myself
been
under
the
influence
of
a
sudden
and
violent
passion
i
would
have
seen
that
alfred
needed
sympathy
as
well
as
she
for
alfred
was
the
man
most
menaced
by
the
contents
of
the
letter
now
on
the
point
of
being
read
and
he
knew
this
as
certainly
as
she
did
as
this
letter
is
better
known
to
you
than
it
was
to
me
up
to
this
hour
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
its
effect
upon
the
jury
and
the
excited
crowd
of
spectators
thronging
the
room
at
every
point
heads
which
had
wagged
in
doubt
now
drooped
in
heaviest
depression
and
while
all
eyes
seemed
to
shrink
from
an
attempt
to
read
the
three
white
faces
on
the
witnesses
bench
the
attention
of
all
was
concentrated
there
and
it
was
with
quite
a
sense
of
shock
that
frisbie
voice
was
heard
rising
again
in
renewed
examination
of
the
young
lady
whose
precipitate
action
had
brought
to
public
notice
this
touching
letter
of
a
heartbroken
father
his
first
question
was
a
leading
one
had
gillespie
followed
up
his
former
confidences
by
any
further
allusions
to
the
attempt
which
had
been
made
upon
his
life
her
answer
was
a
direct
negative
though
she
had
detected
in
her
uncle
signs
of
great
unhappiness
he
had
held
no
further
conversation
with
her
on
this
topic
and
life
had
gone
on
as
usual
in
the
great
house
but
he
talked
of
poisons
and
refused
to
take
any
more
of
the
medicine
which
came
so
near
killing
him
uncle
archibald
took
no
more
of
this
medicine
certainly
that
is
i
saw
no
more
of
it
in
the
house
but
he
never
talked
of
poisons
that
is
publicly
or
in
my
presence
not
at
the
table
not
after
that
night
sir
he
had
before
only
incidentally
he
had
laughed
at
some
of
bennett
remarks
and
once
i
heard
him
mention
the
danger
of
taking
an
overdose
of
the
remedy
that
was
doing
him
so
much
good
it
was
while
jesting
with
me
upon
my
refusal
to
allow
anyone
else
to
portion
it
out
for
him
that
was
your
duty
then
assuredly
were
you
in
the
habit
of
preparing
his
glass
when
alone
or
in
the
presence
of
his
sons
as
it
happened
sir
i
had
but
one
dread
that
of
miscounting
the
drops
and
he
took
no
more
of
this
medicine
after
that
especial
night
no
sir
he
asked
bennett
for
a
narcotic
of
less
dangerous
properties
and
was
given
chloral
did
you
hear
any
remarks
made
on
this
change
none
what
became
of
the
phial
which
held
the
remainder
of
this
medicine
marked
i
emptied
it
out
at
my
uncle
request
you
were
your
uncle
nurse
then
typewriter
and
friend
he
trusted
me
sir
in
all
these
capacities
did
he
trust
you
with
his
business
concerns
not
at
all
i
merely
wrote
letters
to
his
dictation
did
you
know
or
have
you
ever
heard
the
value
of
his
estate
i
have
never
even
asked
myself
whether
he
counted
his
fortune
by
thousands
or
millions
the
dignity
the
simplicity
with
which
this
was
said
made
it
an
impressive
termination
to
a
very
painful
examination
as
i
noted
the
effect
it
produced
i
was
in
hopes
that
she
would
be
allowed
to
retire
for
the
day
but
the
coroner
had
other
views
with
a
hesitancy
that
more
or
less
prepared
us
for
what
was
to
come
he
addressed
her
again
saying
quietly
i
have
spared
you
a
public
reading
of
certain
portions
of
your
uncle
letter
referring
to
yourself
and
the
wishes
he
openly
cherished
in
your
behalf
in
return
will
you
inform
me
if
you
are
engaged
to
marry
any
one
of
these
young
men
the
thrill
the
start
given
to
the
witnesses
bench
by
this
pointed
question
communicated
itself
to
officer
and
spectator
in
fiery
flush
and
alfred
sudden
paleness
emotions
could
be
seen
at
work
of
sufficient
significance
to
draw
every
eye
though
few
present
i
dare
say
ascribed
these
emotions
to
their
rightful
sources
to
myself
divided
as
i
was
in
feeling
between
the
anxiety
i
could
not
but
feel
as
her
lawyer
to
see
her
parry
a
question
too
personal
not
to
be
humiliating
and
the
interest
with
which
as
her
lover
i
awaited
a
response
which
would
solve
my
own
doubts
and
make
clear
my
own
position
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
of
both
these
men
strongly
suggestive
of
a
like
uncertainty
were
her
feelings
then
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
them
as
they
were
to
me
did
george
fear
to
hear
her
say
she
was
engaged
to
alfred
and
alfred
dread
to
hear
her
admit
that
she
was
irrevocably
pledged
to
george
if
so
what
a
situation
had
been
evolved
by
this
question
publicly
put
by
a
city
functionary
no
wonder
the
young
girl
dropped
her
eyes
before
venturing
a
reply
but
the
spirit
of
always
greater
in
woman
than
in
man
where
heart
secrets
are
involved
gave
her
strength
to
meet
this
crisis
with
a
baffling
serenity
raising
her
patient
eyes
she
replied
with
a
sweet
composure
which
acted
like
a
tonic
upon
the
agitated
hearts
about
her
there
is
no
such
engagement
i
have
lived
in
their
house
like
a
sister
their
father
was
my
mother
brother
another
man
than
coroner
frisbie
would
have
let
her
go
but
this
honest
if
kindly
official
was
strangely
tenacious
when
he
had
a
point
to
gain
flushing
himself
for
her
look
was
directed
quite
steadily
upon
him
he
gravely
repeated
do
you
mean
to
say
that
no
words
of
love
ever
passed
between
you
and
any
of
these
gentlemen
this
was
too
much
expecting
to
see
her
recoil
possibly
break
down
i
eagerly
looked
her
way
for
the
permission
to
interfere
which
she
might
now
be
ready
to
give
me
but
with
a
proud
lift
of
her
head
she
showed
herself
equal
to
the
emergency
and
her
answer
given
simply
and
with
no
attempt
at
subterfuge
restored
her
at
once
to
the
dignified
position
we
all
dreaded
to
see
her
lose
i
mean
to
say
nothing
but
the
truth
george
gillespie
has
more
than
once
honoured
me
by
making
me
an
offer
of
his
hand
but
i
did
not
consider
myself
in
a
position
to
accept
it
frisbie
showed
her
no
quarter
and
your
cousin
alfred
alfred
her
eyes
no
longer
met
those
of
the
coroner
or
anyone
else
in
that
cruel
crowd
he
she
stammered
proudly
has
never
interfered
with
whatever
claims
his
brother
may
have
been
supposed
to
have
upon
my
favour
it
was
a
statement
to
awaken
turmoil
in
more
than
one
of
the
uneasy
hearts
behind
her
george
bounded
to
his
feet
though
he
quickly
subsided
again
into
his
seat
ashamed
of
this
betrayal
or
fearful
of
the
effect
it
might
have
upon
his
brother
alfred
on
the
contrary
sat
still
but
the
bitterness
visible
in
his
smile
spoke
volumes
and
seeing
it
the
whole
crowd
recognised
what
had
long
been
apparent
to
myself
that
these
two
brothers
were
rivals
in
the
love
they
bore
this
woman
and
that
it
was
through
her
desire
to
shield
the
one
she
favoured
that
she
made
the
first
false
move
which
had
drawn
the
attention
of
the
police
to
the
doubtful
position
held
by
gillespie
sons
that
her
choice
had
fallen
upon
the
man
who
had
not
interfered
with
his
brother
rights
seemed
only
too
probable
and
i
expected
the
coroner
to
force
this
acknowledgment
from
her
lips
but
he
grew
considerate
all
at
once
and
inquired
instead
if
gillespie
had
been
made
aware
of
his
elder
son
wishes
she
replied
to
this
by
saying
they
were
no
secret
in
the
house
and
with
a
look
begged
him
to
spare
her
but
this
man
was
inexorable
and
did
he
approve
of
the
match
he
did
yet
you
failed
to
engage
yourself
this
she
deemed
already
answered
if
the
younger
brother
had
pressed
his
suit
for
your
hand
do
you
think
that
under
the
circumstances
your
uncle
would
have
sanctioned
such
rivalry
this
perhaps
she
could
not
answer
at
all
events
she
was
as
silent
as
before
miss
meredith
proceeded
her
tormentor
utterly
oblivious
or
entirely
careless
of
the
suffering
he
caused
her
do
you
know
whether
your
uncle
and
his
youngest
son
ever
had
any
words
on
this
subject
her
hands
involuntarily
flew
out
in
piteous
entreaty
ask
this
question
of
the
only
person
who
can
answer
it
she
cried
i
only
know
that
i
have
been
treated
with
great
respect
in
the
house
of
my
uncle
with
that
the
proceedings
closed
for
the
day
xiv
a
sudden
turn
frisbie
point
had
been
made
as
we
separated
to
our
several
destinations
for
the
night
it
was
with
the
universally
expressed
conviction
that
this
young
girl
for
all
her
beauty
and
attractive
qualities
had
been
an
apple
of
discord
in
her
uncle
house
and
that
in
this
fact
rather
than
in
an
impatient
desire
to
enjoy
the
wealth
of
a
man
who
was
never
close
with
his
sons
the
unnatural
crime
we
were
considering
had
originated
the
evidence
elicited
from
the
first
witness
called
to
the
stand
on
the
following
morning
tended
to
substantiate
this
conclusion
nellie
stryker
an
old
inmate
of
the
gillespie
house
answered
the
coroner
questions
with
great
reluctance
she
had
been
maid
to
gillespie
nurse
to
all
the
children
and
a
trusted
servant
in
the
household
ever
since
the
latter
grew
beyond
her
care
of
the
attempts
made
upon
her
master
life
the
last
of
which
had
been
only
too
successful
she
knew
little
and
that
only
by
hearsay
but
she
was
not
quite
so
ignorant
concerning
a
certain
conversation
which
had
been
held
one
morning
in
gillespie
room
between
that
gentleman
and
his
youngest
son
she
was
sitting
at
her
needle
in
the
adjoining
and
whether
her
presence
there
was
unsuspected
by
her
master
or
simply
ignored
they
both
talked
quite
freely
and
she
heard
every
word
urged
to
repeat
this
conversation
the
good
old
soul
showed
a
shamefaced
reluctance
which
bore
out
her
reputation
for
honesty
and
discretion
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
escape
the
examination
set
for
her
after
repeated
questions
and
a
show
of
extreme
patience
on
the
part
of
the
coroner
she
admitted
that
the
topic
discussed
was
the
state
of
alfred
affections
this
young
gentleman
as
was
publicly
known
had
lately
engaged
himself
to
a
southern
lady
of
great
pride
and
high
social
distinction
and
his
present
disagreement
with
his
father
arose
out
of
his
wish
to
break
this
engagement
his
father
had
no
patience
with
such
fickleness
and
their
words
ran
high
finally
alfred
threatened
to
follow
his
own
wishes
in
the
matter
whether
it
gave
satisfaction
all
round
or
no
declaring
that
he
had
been
a
fool
to
tie
himself
to
a
girl
he
cared
nothing
about
but
that
he
would
be
a
still
greater
one
if
he
let
the
mistake
of
a
moment
mar
his
happiness
for
life
but
the
old
gentleman
sense
of
honour
was
very
keen
and
he
continued
to
urge
the
claims
of
the
southern
lady
till
his
son
impetuously
blurted
out
i
thought
you
wanted
one
of
us
to
marry
hope
this
caused
a
break
in
the
conversation
do
you
care
for
hope
the
old
gentleman
asked
i
thought
it
was
well
understood
in
this
house
that
george
not
you
was
to
be
given
the
first
opportunity
of
winning
her
the
oath
with
which
alfred
answered
was
shocking
to
nellie
ears
and
affected
her
so
deeply
that
she
heard
nothing
more
till
these
words
caught
her
attention
george
has
everything
he
wants
unlimited
indulgence
in
each
and
every
fancy
the
liking
of
all
the
men
and
the
love
of
all
the
women
i
am
not
so
fortunate
i
am
neither
a
favourite
with
my
mates
nor
the
petted
darling
of
their
sisters
i
like
my
ease
but
i
could
give
that
up
for
hope
she
is
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
seen
capable
of
influencing
me
i
have
been
quite
a
different
man
since
she
came
into
the
house
if
that
is
love
it
is
a
very
strong
love
such
love
as
makes
a
man
out
of
a
nobody
father
let
me
have
this
darling
girl
for
my
wife
george
does
not
care
for
her
not
as
i
do
he
would
be
a
better
fellow
if
he
did
gillespie
seemed
quite
upset
he
loved
this
son
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
would
very
possibly
have
been
glad
to
see
the
matter
so
adjusted
but
it
did
not
tally
with
his
idea
of
what
people
had
a
right
to
expect
from
his
sons
and
he
told
alfred
so
in
rather
strong
language
can
you
remember
that
language
asked
the
coroner
she
tried
to
make
him
believe
and
herself
too
no
doubt
that
her
memory
would
not
serve
her
to
this
extent
but
her
honesty
eventually
triumphed
over
her
devotion
to
the
family
interests
and
she
finally
admitted
that
the
old
gentleman
had
said
while
i
live
i
will
not
put
up
with
rivalry
of
any
kind
between
my
sons
george
is
fond
of
hope
and
i
long
ago
gave
him
my
permission
to
woo
and
marry
her
that
you
are
the
child
of
my
heart
shall
not
make
me
blind
to
the
rights
of
one
i
loved
before
you
ever
saw
the
light
were
i
to
permit
such
george
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
me
with
his
wasted
life
no
the
influence
which
you
call
so
great
must
be
exerted
in
his
behalf
rather
than
yours
he
needs
it
alfred
as
much
if
not
more
than
you
do
as
to
your
present
engagement
you
may
break
it
or
you
may
keep
it
but
do
not
expect
me
to
uphold
you
in
any
with
your
brother
choice
till
hope
has
openly
signified
her
absolute
refusal
of
his
attentions
this
she
is
not
likely
to
do
george
has
too
many
conspicuous
attractions
she
has
refused
him
once
not
because
her
fancy
was
caught
by
his
younger
brother
but
because
she
wished
to
see
some
reformation
in
his
habits
in
this
she
was
perfectly
right
george
will
have
to
change
his
mode
of
life
very
materially
before
he
can
be
regarded
as
worthy
of
such
a
wife
the
same
might
be
said
of
me
but
i
am
no
george
i
am
anxious
to
make
such
a
change
yet
you
give
me
no
encouragement
in
my
efforts
and
even
deny
me
the
opportunity
of
winning
her
affections
you
were
not
the
first
to
enter
the
field
your
older
brother
has
the
prior
right
and
as
i
view
the
matter
the
only
right
to
approach
hope
in
the
attitude
of
a
lover
the
oaths
which
this
excited
turned
the
poor
old
listener
cold
alfred
could
not
see
the
justice
of
his
brother
course
and
stormed
away
about
fairness
being
shown
to
the
young
girl
herself
who
possibly
looked
upon
the
matter
in
another
light
than
he
did
then
you
have
been
making
love
to
her
on
the
sly
vociferated
gillespie
totally
forgetting
himself
but
this
the
young
man
denied
if
he
understood
her
better
than
others
did
it
was
because
he
loved
her
better
he
was
positive
that
she
did
not
care
for
his
brother
and
all
but
certain
she
did
care
for
himself
at
all
events
he
flattered
himself
to
this
extent
this
called
forth
a
few
more
bitter
words
from
his
father
and
alfred
went
out
banging
the
door
behind
him
and
did
you
see
any
change
in
the
manner
of
gillespie
towards
his
sons
after
this
misunderstanding
with
alfred
the
witness
appeared
to
weigh
her
words
but
when
she
answered
it
was
evident
her
care
arose
from
a
desire
to
present
the
subject
fairly
i
thought
gillespie
talked
less
and
looked
about
him
more
and
the
young
gentlemen
seemed
conscious
of
this
change
in
him
for
they
were
very
careful
not
to
show
their
feelings
too
plainly
in
his
presence
yet
there
was
a
manifested
distrust
between
them
i
fear
so
amounting
to
animosity
that
i
can
not
say
i
never
heard
them
exchange
hard
words
only
neither
of
them
would
leave
the
field
open
to
the
other
if
george
stayed
home
alfred
found
some
excuse
for
doing
so
also
and
if
alfred
showed
a
disposition
to
linger
in
the
parlour
george
brought
in
his
friends
and
made
a
social
evening
of
it
and
is
this
all
you
can
tell
us
on
this
topic
yes
you
never
saw
miss
meredith
speaking
apart
to
either
of
these
two
men
no
sir
on
the
contrary
she
appeared
to
avoid
all
private
conversation
with
any
of
them
nor
ever
heard
either
of
these
men
swear
he
would
have
miss
meredith
for
his
wife
no
matter
who
stood
in
the
way
or
what
means
were
taken
to
stop
him
oh
i
once
heard
alfred
make
use
of
some
violent
expressions
as
i
was
passing
his
door
but
i
can
not
be
sure
he
spoke
the
precise
words
you
mention
he
falls
into
fits
of
anger
at
times
and
then
is
liable
to
forget
himself
but
his
does
not
last
sir
it
is
quite
unusual
for
him
to
show
unkindness
for
any
length
of
time
after
the
close
of
this
examination
so
painful
to
the
witnesses
and
so
humiliating
to
the
three
persons
whose
most
cherished
feelings
were
thus
exposed
to
the
public
eye
the
three
sons
of
gillespie
were
called
up
one
after
the
other
and
questioned
leighton
made
the
best
impression
not
being
involved
in
the
delicate
question
which
had
just
come
up
he
had
no
blushes
to
conceal
nor
any
secret
animosities
to
hold
in
check
george
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
have
reached
a
state
of
exasperation
which
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
preserve
any
semblance
of
he
stammered
when
he
talked
and
looked
much
more
like
having
it
out
with
his
brother
in
a
fight
than
submitting
to
an
examination
tending
to
incriminate
one
or
both
of
them
on
a
charge
of
murder
alfred
showed
less
bitterness
possibly
because
he
felt
securer
in
his
position
towards
the
woman
whose
beauty
had
occasioned
this
rivalry
of
the
facts
brought
out
by
their
accumulated
testimony
i
need
say
little
they
added
nothing
to
the
general
knowledge
and
the
inquiry
adjourned
with
promise
of
still
more
serious
work
for
the
morrow
hitherto
the
evidence
had
been
of
a
nature
to
show
first
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
secondly
that
the
relations
between
alfred
and
his
father
had
been
such
as
to
occasion
a
desire
on
the
former
part
to
be
free
from
the
watchful
eye
of
one
who
stood
between
him
and
any
attempt
he
might
make
to
win
the
affections
of
the
woman
upon
whom
he
had
set
his
heart
on
this
morning
the
testimony
took
a
turn
and
an
endeavour
was
made
to
show
a
positive
connection
between
alfred
gillespie
and
the
drug
which
had
ended
his
life
or
so
it
appeared
at
the
time
the
visit
he
paid
to
the
during
the
fatal
hour
preceding
his
father
death
was
brought
out
and
the
acknowledgment
reached
that
he
went
there
in
search
of
his
missing
pencil
then
the
detectives
were
called
to
the
stand
and
requested
to
relate
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
finding
of
a
certain
cork
and
phial
the
one
under
the
edge
of
the
rug
and
the
other
under
the
clock
on
the
these
aforementioned
articles
were
then
produced
and
after
positive
declaration
had
been
made
that
they
had
not
been
allowed
to
come
in
contact
since
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
police
they
were
severally
handed
down
to
the
jury
who
immediately
proceeded
to
satisfy
themselves
that
the
scent
of
bitter
almonds
was
nearly
as
marked
in
one
as
the
other
this
point
having
been
reached
and
universal
expectation
raised
sweetwater
handed
up
another
article
to
the
coroner
saying
in
this
box
which
is
as
nearly
as
i
could
procure
offhand
i
caused
to
be
placed
as
soon
as
possible
after
finding
it
the
pencil
which
we
came
upon
in
our
search
of
the
floor
like
the
phial
and
the
cork
it
was
kept
isolated
in
a
perfectly
clean
glass
till
this
box
could
be
procured
and
with
this
fact
in
mind
may
i
ask
you
to
open
the
box
and
hand
the
pencil
round
among
the
jury
instantly
a
great
stir
took
place
in
the
whole
body
of
spectators
necks
were
stretched
heads
were
craned
and
a
general
sigh
swept
from
end
to
end
of
the
room
as
the
coroner
wrenched
the
cover
from
the
box
lifted
out
the
pencil
raised
it
to
his
nose
and
then
passed
it
down
to
the
jury
only
one
person
in
sight
failed
to
follow
these
significant
movements
with
looks
of
curious
interest
and
that
was
the
unhappy
man
who
thus
saw
the
finger
of
suspicion
which
had
been
simply
wavering
in
his
direction
settle
into
immobility
and
point
inexorably
towards
him
a
white
face
and
a
sinking
heart
were
shown
by
alfred
gillespie
at
that
moment
and
in
the
features
of
hope
disclosed
for
one
instant
under
the
stress
of
her
mortal
anxiety
i
saw
his
anxiety
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
the
jury
whispered
together
with
nods
and
significant
looks
as
this
small
pencil
passed
from
hand
to
hand
i
had
almost
said
from
nose
to
nose
then
silence
was
restored
and
the
coroner
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
startling
to
observe
in
one
whose
bearing
and
tone
reflected
his
feelings
almost
too
openly
called
an
expert
in
poisons
to
the
stand
his
testimony
established
three
facts
that
the
smell
of
prussic
acid
is
unmistakable
that
this
poison
though
volatile
in
its
character
preserves
its
own
individual
odour
for
a
long
time
if
not
subjected
to
too
much
air
and
lastly
that
if
the
pencil
smelt
of
the
bottle
the
pocket
in
which
they
both
had
lain
would
also
give
out
the
same
odour
of
bitter
almonds
when
the
expert
was
seated
detective
sweetwater
was
called
back
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
a
large
package
encumbering
the
coroner
desk
as
this
package
was
being
unrolled
i
stole
a
look
at
the
witness
who
from
his
assured
air
evidently
had
the
thread
of
alfred
future
destiny
in
his
hand
and
was
astonished
to
see
how
attractive
a
very
plain
man
can
sometimes
become
perhaps
i
have
not
spoken
of
this
young
detective
plainness
it
was
so
marked
and
of
such
an
unrelieved
type
that
after
once
seeing
the
man
you
could
never
again
think
of
him
without
recalling
his
lank
frame
and
inharmonious
features
yet
as
he
stood
there
calm
amidst
the
tremor
of
this
throng
his
eye
sparkled
with
such
intelligence
that
i
trembled
for
the
man
whose
cause
he
was
expected
to
damage
with
his
testimony
seeing
that
my
feelings
were
shared
by
those
about
me
i
glanced
back
at
the
coroner
table
to
see
what
the
unrolling
of
that
package
had
revealed
and
saw
hanging
from
the
coroner
hands
three
vests
which
he
proceeded
to
display
one
by
one
before
the
witness
what
are
these
he
asked
with
a
stern
look
down
the
room
calculated
to
suppress
any
too
open
demonstration
of
interest
vests
the
property
of
the
three
gentlemen
members
of
the
present
gillespie
household
in
other
words
those
severally
worn
by
george
leighton
and
alfred
gillespie
on
the
evening
of
their
father
death
how
do
you
know
these
particular
vests
to
be
the
ones
then
worn
from
their
material
and
cut
of
which
i
took
especial
note
at
the
time
no
other
way
yes
sir
foreseeing
the
difficulties
which
might
arise
if
it
ever
became
necessary
to
distinguish
the
vests
then
worn
from
the
half
dozen
others
which
we
should
doubtless
find
in
their
wardrobes
i
took
the
precaution
of
secretly
running
my
finger
over
a
freshly
inked
pen
before
taking
hold
of
their
vests
in
the
search
i
had
been
commanded
to
make
of
their
persons
if
the
marks
of
my
finger
can
be
seen
on
the
white
linings
of
the
vests
now
in
your
hand
you
may
be
sure
they
are
the
ones
subjected
to
my
search
on
that
night
as
i
communicated
my
intention
to
no
one
and
have
since
been
exceedingly
careful
not
to
take
anyone
into
my
confidence
concerning
this
little
trick
the
coroner
turned
the
vests
on
the
back
of
each
a
black
spot
was
plainly
visible
to
the
remotest
observer
in
the
room
a
murmur
of
mingled
admiration
and
suspense
responded
to
this
discovery
and
the
coroner
turned
again
to
sweetwater
may
i
ask
said
he
if
you
are
in
a
position
to
tell
us
to
which
of
these
young
gentlemen
these
several
vests
belong
the
gillespie
can
be
trusted
to
identify
their
own
property
was
the
answer
but
i
doubt
if
you
will
consider
this
a
necessary
formality
there
is
no
scent
of
bitter
almonds
lingering
about
any
of
these
pockets
there
was
none
on
that
night
this
i
made
it
my
especial
business
to
ascertain
and
he
glanced
at
alfred
as
much
as
to
say
thank
me
for
doing
you
what
justice
i
can
such
surprise
followed
this
unexpected
acknowledgment
from
one
whose
manner
had
given
promise
of
a
very
different
result
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
where
the
effect
was
greatest
hope
veil
was
shifted
again
and
the
three
brothers
looked
up
simultaneously
and
with
an
equal
show
of
relief
but
their
countenances
fell
again
as
they
noted
the
witness
still
on
the
stand
waiting
my
countenance
fell
too
or
rather
my
heart
began
to
throb
apprehensively
as
i
now
perceived
the
face
and
form
of
gryce
slowly
appearing
round
the
corner
of
a
certain
jut
in
the
wall
where
he
had
held
himself
partially
concealed
during
most
of
the
proceedings
if
this
sagacious
but
sickly
old
detective
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
come
forward
i
thought
it
worth
mine
to
note
upon
whom
or
on
what
his
glance
first
fell
but
i
had
forgotten
his
habit
known
to
most
men
who
have
had
anything
to
do
with
this
celebrated
detective
he
had
looks
for
nothing
save
the
umbrella
he
rolled
round
and
round
between
his
palms
though
his
face
if
this
indicated
anything
was
turned
towards
the
seat
where
the
three
gillespies
sat
rather
than
towards
the
witness
with
whose
testimony
past
present
and
to
come
he
was
probably
fully
acquainted
meantime
the
coroner
was
speaking
when
you
failed
to
find
the
scent
of
bitter
almonds
tainting
the
pockets
of
any
of
the
clothes
worn
by
these
young
gentlemen
at
the
time
you
searched
them
what
did
you
do
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
that
is
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
unobserved
i
searched
the
wardrobes
of
these
young
gentlemen
for
other
vests
and
pockets
ah
and
did
you
come
upon
any
article
of
clothing
giving
signs
of
having
at
any
time
come
in
contact
with
this
pencil
or
this
bottle
i
found
he
returned
indicating
a
fourth
garment
which
the
coroner
now
deftly
drew
forth
from
the
paper
where
it
had
hitherto
lain
concealed
this
garment
was
a
vest
like
the
others
and
like
them
of
a
plain
and
inconspicuous
pattern
as
it
was
lifted
into
sight
a
groan
was
heard
which
seemed
to
spring
from
the
united
breasts
of
the
three
young
men
behind
him
then
one
bounded
to
his
feet
that
is
my
vest
he
shouted
what
damned
villain
says
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
it
it
was
george
the
two
other
brothers
had
shrunk
back
out
of
sight
xv
the
missing
pocket
the
excitement
was
intense
to
see
suspicion
thus
suddenly
and
i
must
say
deftly
shifted
from
the
man
hitherto
regarded
guilty
to
one
whom
nobody
had
seemed
inclined
to
doubt
was
to
experience
an
emotion
of
no
ordinary
nature
i
was
so
affected
by
it
that
i
quite
forgot
myself
and
stared
first
at
the
vest
thus
recognised
by
its
owner
then
at
the
witness
who
was
calmly
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
deep
bewilderment
only
cut
short
by
the
coroner
abrupt
words
where
did
you
find
this
vest
i
now
hold
up
before
you
in
the
closet
of
the
adjoining
the
apartment
where
george
gillespie
is
said
to
sleep
does
this
communicate
with
the
hall
or
with
any
other
room
than
the
said
gillespie
sleeping
apartment
no
is
it
a
large
room
or
a
small
one
a
mere
closet
or
a
place
big
enough
for
a
man
to
turn
about
in
with
ease
and
do
such
a
thing
say
as
change
his
vest
without
being
seen
too
plainly
by
persons
in
the
adjoining
room
it
is
a
room
sir
if
anyone
chose
to
do
what
you
suggest
in
the
especial
corner
where
the
wardrobe
stands
he
certainly
would
run
little
chance
of
being
seen
by
anyone
sitting
near
the
fireplace
of
the
sleeping
apartment
why
do
you
speak
of
the
fireplace
because
the
evidences
are
strong
that
this
was
where
three
friends
were
sitting
when
he
came
up
from
below
with
the
bottle
of
sherry
in
his
hands
what
evidences
do
you
allude
to
the
fact
that
we
found
four
chairs
standing
there
about
a
table
strewn
with
cards
i
did
not
see
the
gentlemen
in
their
seats
but
you
did
see
this
vest
hanging
on
one
of
the
nails
in
the
wardrobe
yes
sir
a
near
nail
or
a
remote
one
the
remotest
in
the
closet
very
good
what
is
the
matter
with
this
vest
it
lacks
a
pocket
ah
so
that
was
it
the
coroner
turned
the
vest
in
his
hand
what
pocket
the
lower
one
the
one
where
a
gentleman
usually
carries
a
pen
knife
or
pencil
what
has
happened
to
it
how
could
a
pocket
be
lost
from
a
vest
it
has
been
cut
out
cut
out
yes
sir
we
found
an
open
knife
lying
on
the
dresser
and
if
you
will
look
again
at
the
vest
you
will
see
that
the
missing
pocket
was
slit
from
it
with
a
very
hasty
jerk
i
avow
shouted
the
voice
of
the
owner
from
the
seats
behind
but
the
infuriated
man
who
thus
attempted
to
speak
was
quickly
silenced
you
will
be
allowed
to
explain
later
remonstrated
the
coroner
at
present
we
are
listening
to
sweetwater
witness
what
course
did
you
pursue
after
coming
upon
this
vest
i
endeavoured
to
ascertain
if
its
owner
had
gone
into
his
after
coming
up
from
the
room
below
here
we
heard
sobs
but
they
were
only
a
child
and
the
inquiry
went
on
did
you
succeed
i
request
you
to
call
up
james
baxter
as
a
more
direct
witness
his
request
being
complied
with
james
baxter
came
forward
and
expectancy
rose
to
he
was
one
of
the
three
gentlemen
whose
voices
i
had
heard
over
the
cards
that
were
being
played
in
george
gillespie
room
during
the
hour
his
father
had
succumbed
to
poison
i
recognised
him
at
once
from
his
burly
figure
and
weak
voice
having
noticed
this
eccentricity
at
our
first
meeting
he
was
not
sober
then
but
he
was
very
sober
now
and
the
effect
he
produced
was
on
the
whole
favourable
glancing
at
george
as
if
in
apology
and
receiving
a
tiger
glare
in
return
he
waited
with
a
certain
for
the
inevitable
question
it
came
quickly
and
with
a
peremptoriness
which
showed
that
the
coroner
now
felt
himself
on
safe
ground
where
were
you
sitting
when
george
gillespie
left
you
to
go
downstairs
for
wine
at
the
near
the
fire
with
my
face
towards
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
had
wine
been
passed
then
or
any
spirituous
liquors
no
you
were
all
in
a
perfectly
sober
condition
therefore
tolerably
so
two
of
us
had
had
dinner
at
delmonico
but
i
had
been
dining
at
home
and
was
dry
that
is
why
gillespie
went
down
for
the
wine
what
did
you
do
while
he
was
downstairs
bet
on
the
jack
about
to
be
turned
up
how
much
money
passed
oh
ten
dollars
or
so
and
when
your
host
returned
what
did
you
do
i
guess
we
drank
did
he
drink
too
i
did
not
notice
he
put
the
bottle
down
and
went
into
his
when
he
came
back
he
stood
a
minute
by
the
fire
then
he
sat
down
he
may
have
drank
then
i
did
observe
what
did
he
do
at
the
fire
was
he
warming
himself
it
was
not
a
cold
night
i
do
know
what
he
did
i
saw
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
but
that
was
all
i
was
busy
dealing
the
cards
you
saw
a
flame
shoot
up
was
there
wood
or
coal
in
the
grate
deuce
take
me
if
i
remember
i
was
thinking
of
the
fire
i
only
knew
we
were
roasting
hot
and
more
than
once
made
some
movement
towards
shifting
the
table
further
off
but
we
got
too
interested
in
the
cards
to
bother
about
it
it
must
have
been
a
lively
game
were
you
too
interested
in
shuffling
and
dealing
to
notice
why
gillespie
went
to
his
yes
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
you
did
watch
him
then
no
can
not
say
whether
or
not
he
went
towards
his
wardrobe
no
or
perhaps
whether
the
door
between
you
was
closed
or
not
he
did
close
the
door
i
should
have
noticed
that
how
long
was
he
in
that
room
i
ca
say
long
enough
for
me
to
drink
my
wine
and
shuffle
the
cards
before
i
had
dealt
them
he
had
set
down
one
question
more
can
you
truthfully
assert
he
did
not
cross
his
before
your
eyes
change
his
vest
in
the
corner
where
the
wardrobe
stands
and
come
back
in
the
same
coat
but
with
a
different
vest
on
no
i
can
not
even
say
what
kind
of
clothes
he
wore
that
night
i
am
no
dude
and
all
vests
so
long
as
they
are
not
striped
or
plaid
are
alike
to
me
this
remark
which
was
facetious
only
from
the
humorous
contrast
between
the
small
and
highpitched
voice
and
the
large
and
stalwart
figure
of
the
speaker
caused
a
smile
to
appear
on
several
faces
but
this
expression
was
soon
replaced
by
one
more
befitting
the
occasion
as
a
change
in
witnesses
once
more
occurred
and
hewson
appeared
upon
the
stand
this
old
servant
of
the
family
was
loath
to
look
at
the
vest
held
out
before
him
and
seemed
desirous
of
denying
that
he
had
noticed
what
his
young
master
had
worn
at
dinner
that
night
but
his
precision
and
habitual
attention
to
details
were
too
well
known
for
him
to
succeed
in
any
evasion
and
he
was
forced
to
declare
that
the
vest
with
the
thumb
mark
on
the
lining
was
not
the
one
george
had
worn
at
dinner
this
was
a
fatal
admission
and
george
case
was
looking
very
black
when
a
sudden
cry
mingled
with
a
burst
of
childish
sobs
was
heard
in
the
room
and
little
claire
breaking
away
from
the
restraining
hands
that
sought
to
hold
her
back
rushed
out
in
face
of
coroner
and
jury
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
her
father
cried
uncle
george
did
cut
the
pocket
out
of
his
vest
i
did
i
i
wanted
a
little
bag
for
my
beads
and
hetty
would
make
me
one
so
i
stole
into
uncle
room
and
snipped
out
the
little
pocket
it
was
before
grandpa
died
and
i
so
so
sorry
she
fell
into
her
father
arms
and
was
crushed
nay
strained
against
that
father
breast
never
had
a
child
naughtiness
brought
a
more
perfect
joy
while
from
floor
to
ceiling
of
the
great
room
cries
and
shouts
of
relief
went
up
from
the
surcharged
hearts
of
the
spectators
which
for
once
the
coroner
failed
to
rebuke
possibly
he
was
as
much
touched
as
anyone
there
was
so
much
natural
impulse
so
much
spontaneity
in
the
child
words
and
actions
that
no
one
could
doubt
her
candour
or
the
fact
that
this
outburst
had
been
prompted
by
her
own
contrition
even
gryce
accepted
the
explanation
without
demur
though
he
must
have
realised
that
it
demolished
at
a
blow
the
case
he
had
so
carefully
reared
against
the
oldest
son
of
gillespie
he
was
even
seen
to
smile
benignantly
and
with
a
kind
of
soothing
tenderness
on
the
knob
of
his
umbrella
before
he
rested
his
chin
upon
it
in
quiet
contemplation
hope
who
had
made
an
impetuous
movement
as
the
child
flew
by
her
let
her
eye
fall
for
a
moment
on
the
curly
head
almost
nestled
out
of
sight
in
the
paternal
embrace
then
with
a
glance
at
george
scarcely
long
enough
to
note
the
relief
this
childish
hand
had
brought
him
she
let
her
eye
travel
slowly
on
to
alfred
who
biting
his
lips
to
keep
down
the
flush
which
these
rapidly
succeeding
events
had
called
up
did
not
catch
her
look
precious
as
it
doubtless
would
have
been
to
him
then
and
not
till
then
did
her
gaze
seek
mine
alas
this
recognition
of
my
interest
so
eagerly
anticipated
and
so
patiently
waited
for
was
inspired
by
no
deeper
sentiment
than
a
desire
to
gather
my
present
idea
of
the
situation
and
what
was
now
to
be
expected
from
the
baffled
officials
if
my
answering
look
conveyed
undue
confidence
in
the
outcome
i
had
certainly
sufficient
excuse
for
it
in
the
attitude
of
those
about
me
the
explanation
which
george
was
able
to
give
of
the
causes
which
had
led
to
his
changing
his
vest
on
the
evening
in
question
were
received
with
respect
if
not
with
favour
and
as
it
was
natural
enough
to
gain
credence
enthusiasm
in
his
regard
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
it
presently
became
evident
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
to
push
the
case
farther
before
this
jury
indeed
the
reaction
was
so
strong
that
after
some
futile
attempts
to
reopen
the
inquiry
on
fresh
lines
the
coroner
finally
gave
in
and
called
for
the
jury
verdict
it
was
as
might
be
expected
death
from
the
effects

hand
unknown
xvi
in
the
parlour
at
meantime
the
will
of
gillespie
had
been
admitted
to
probate
but
as
he
had
never
made
any
secret
of
his
intentions
and
the
share
and
share
alike
of
his
sons
had
been
left
without
a
disturbing
codicil
little
help
was
afforded
by
its
terms
in
settling
the
harassing
problem
which
more
than
ever
occupied
the
minds
of
the
community
and
presented
itself
as
an
almost
unanswerable
puzzle
to
the
police
even
gryce
whose
sagacity
no
one
could
doubt
showed
how
unpromising
the
affair
looked
to
him
by
the
line
of
care
which
now
made
its
appearance
on
his
forehead
a
forehead
which
had
remained
singularly
unclouded
till
now
notwithstanding
his
sixty
or
more
years
of
experience
with
such
knotty
problems
this
i
had
occasion
to
note
in
an
interview
i
held
with
him
some
few
days
after
the
rendering
of
the
abovementioned
verdict
he
had
sought
me
with
the
intention
of
satisfying
himself
that
the
ground
had
been
thoroughly
gone
over
and
no
possible
clue
had
been
ignored
but
he
gained
nothing
new
from
me
not
even
my
secret
and
went
away
at
last
looking
older
and
more
careworn
than
my
first
view
of
his
benevolent
and
naturally
composed
countenance
had
led
me
to
expect
but
while
moved
by
this
to
consider
the
seriousness
with
which
these
men
regarded
their
duty
i
was
much
more
deeply
impressed
by
the
corresponding
marks
of
secret
disturbance
which
i
presently
discovered
in
my
own
countenance
for
in
my
case
the
trouble
indicated
did
not
depend
upon
the
settlement
of
an
exciting
case
but
was
the
result
of
a
lasting
impression
made
upon
me
by
a
woman
who
gave
little
sign
of
sharing
a
passion
likely
to
prove
the
one
absorbing
experience
of
my
life
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
forget
her
or
the
position
she
held
among
these
three
men
was
she
still
the
object
of
george
attentions
or
worse
still
of
alfred
passionate
hopes
did
she
respond
to
the
latter
devotion
or
was
she
still
restrained
by
doubts
of
an
innocence
not
yet
entirely
proved
i
longed
to
know
i
longed
to
see
for
myself
how
she
bore
all
these
uncertainties
but
no
excuse
offered
itself
for
a
second
intrusion
upon
her
privacy
even
if
i
had
been
sure
i
should
find
her
still
living
with
her
cousins
and
in
this
unrest
and
state
of
anxious
waiting
the
days
went
by
till
suddenly
i
heard
it
casually
mentioned
at
the
club
that
miss
meredith
was
with
a
distant
connection
of
the
gillespies
in
street
this
was
like
fire
to
tow
without
waiting
to
question
my
own
motives
or
to
ask
whether
it
would
be
for
my
happiness
or
misery
to
see
her
again
i
called
at
the
penrhyn
mansion
and
inquired
for
miss
meredith
to
my
great
relief
and
consequent
delight
she
consented
to
receive
me
and
i
presently
found
myself
seated
in
a
choice
little
awaiting
her
coming
only
then
did
i
begin
to
realise
my
own
temerity
with
what
words
should
i
accost
her
how
open
conversation
without
suggesting
griefs
i
was
burning
to
make
her
forget
i
had
no
time
to
decide
she
was
at
the
door
and
in
the
room
before
my
mind
could
frame
the
simplest
greeting
and
once
brought
face
to
face
with
her
i
forgot
everything
but
herself
and
the
irresistible
charm
which
her
presence
exerted
over
me
she
had
been
weeping
and
i
could
not
but
see
that
the
sight
of
my
face
recalled
scenes
suggestive
of
the
deepest
suffering
in
my
dismay
i
found
my
tongue
and
attempted
some
conventional
expressions
of
these
she
no
sooner
heard
than
she
cut
me
short
by
an
irrepressible
exclamation
pray
she
entreated
you
have
been
with
me
during
a
time
of
too
much
misery
for
such
formalities
as
these
to
pass
between
us
then
before
i
could
protest
what
is
wanted
of
me
now
i
know
you
desire
explanations
of
some
kind
everybody
does
who
approaches
me
even
my
best
friends
yet
i
unburdened
myself
of
everything
i
knew
that
first
night
i
may
have
looked
hurt
i
certainly
felt
so
but
she
did
not
notice
this
result
of
her
abrupt
attack
she
was
too
full
of
the
feverish
anxiety
roused
by
the
subject
she
had
herself
introduced
but
you
are
a
just
man
and
a
good
one
she
went
on
i
do
not
need
to
be
told
so
i
see
it
in
your
face
will
be
honest
with
me
and
will
at
least
acquaint
me
with
the
motive
underlying
any
questions
you
may
put
others
deceive
me
and
lead
me
into
confidences
they
afterwards
turn
against
me
or
against
those
i
have
reason
to
be
true
to
though
i
was
the
first
to
betray
them
her
cheek
so
pale
at
her
entrance
was
burning
red
now
and
she
spoke
quickly
almost
disconnectedly
i
saw
that
she
needed
rallying
and
smiled
now
it
is
you
who
are
pressing
the
subject
you
abhor
i
have
not
asked
you
anything
i
shall
not
i
have
not
come
here
to
satisfy
either
my
curiosity
or
the
demands
of
the
law
i
am
here
to
inquire
after
your
health
and
to
renew
my
offer
of
service
may
i
be
excused
for
my
interest
in
yourself
it
is
involuntary
on
my
part
and
so
sincere
that
your
uncle
were
he
living
could
not
object
to
it
soothed
by
my
voice
as
much
as
by
my
words
she
sat
down
and
endeavoured
to
open
conversation
but
there
was
a
constraint
in
her
manner
which
convinced
me
that
she
was
labouring
under
a
too
vivid
remembrance
of
the
scene
where
we
had
last
met
what
a
position
is
mine
burst
at
last
from
her
lips
i
have
three
natural
protectors
yet
i
do
not
know
of
an
arm
on
which
i
can
place
my
hand
with
implicit
confidence
this
is
my
reason
for
being
in
this
house
and
why
i
hail
with
eagerness
too
great
eagerness
perhaps
the
prospect
of
a
friend
it
was
an
appeal
for
which
i
found
myself
poorly
prepared
especially
as
it
was
made
with
such
simplicity
and
in
such
evident
disregard
of
the
feelings
which
made
my
presence
there
of
such
import
to
myself
it
recalled
to
me
her
position
and
remembering
that
she
was
a
comparative
stranger
in
town
and
that
since
her
coming
she
had
been
all
in
all
to
her
uncle
in
capacities
which
had
kept
her
much
at
home
and
out
of
the
society
where
she
might
have
made
friends
and
found
support
in
this
dreadful
emergency
i
composed
myself
and
leaning
forward
took
her
hand
in
mine
with
a
respect
she
could
not
but
feel
since
it
permeated
my
whole
being
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
was
my
plea
notwithstanding
the
vivid
experiences
which
have
brought
us
together
you
know
little
of
me
beyond
my
name
and
the
fact
that
my
one
wish
since
first
seeing
you
has
been
to
serve
you
and
save
you
from
every
possible
annoyance
this
must
be
obvious
to
you
or
you
would
not
have
accepted
me
so
unhesitatingly
for
your
lawyer
will
you
add
to
this
title
a
title
which
you
have
yourself
given
me
the
more
personal
one
you
have
just
mentioned
will
you
let
me
be
the
friend
you
need
you
can
find
no
truer
one
she
broke
into
a
confused
stammering
amid
which
i
heard
i
will
you
give
me
confidence
then
she
sat
still
her
hand
trembling
in
mine
and
her
eyes
shining
with
a
new
light
it
was
an
innocent
one
that
of
a
child
who
has
stumbled
on
a
protector
in
the
dark
but
to
me
it
was
the
very
glow
of
heaven
the
first
ray
of
promise
by
means
of
which
i
could
discern
even
in
fancy
the
of
my
dreams
was
it
any
wonder
it
intoxicated
me
forgetting
that
i
had
not
been
to
her
all
that
she
had
been
to
me
for
the
last
few
weeks
forgetting
everything
but
that
she
was
an
unhappy
woman
whom
i
passionately
loved
i
gazed
in
her
face
as
a
man
gazes
at
a
woman
but
once
in
a
lifetime
she
did
not
lower
her
eyes
would
that
she
had
but
met
my
looks
with
a
half
smile
whose
open
and
indulgent
kindness
should
have
warned
me
to
recover
my
ground
while
it
was
safe
but
a
sudden
madness
had
seized
me
and
seeing
simply
that
it
was
a
smile
i
found
it
impossible
to
realise
in
the
frenzy
of
the
moment
that
the
feelings
i
had
hitherto
ascribed
to
her
were
true
she
had
liked
not
loved
her
cousins
they
had
been
good
to
her
and
in
return
she
had
given
them
a
cousinly
regard
which
in
one
instance
perhaps
approached
the
warmth
of
love
but
it
was
a
love
far
from
necessary
to
her
life
or
so
i
dared
dream
while
my
passion
for
her
was
a
part
of
my
being
so
close
a
part
that
i
felt
forced
to
speak
and
claim
her
as
my
own
in
this
hour
of
her
greatest
trouble
and
perplexity
before
i
knew
it
before
she
had
time
to
restrain
me
by
word
or
look
i
was
pouring
out
my
soul
before
her
not
in
the
respectful
measured
way
i
had
foreseen
when
looking
forward
to
this
hour
but
wildly
hotly
as
a
man
speaks
when
the
treasure
of
his
life
is
to
be
won
by
one
strong
effort
it
was
sudden
it
was
perhaps
unwarranted
but
my
sincerity
moved
her
that
was
perhaps
why
she
listened
so
patiently
and
it
was
to
this
recognition
of
my
candid
regard
i
attribute
the
look
of
wistfulness
which
crept
over
her
features
when
i
ceased
oh
she
murmured
why
can
not
i
accept
the
love
of
this
good
man
and
rising
up
she
walked
away
from
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
breathlessly
i
watched
her
breathlessly
i
noted
her
walk
the
droop
of
her
head
the
agitated
working
of
her
hands
would
my
good
angel
stand
by
me
and
turn
her
trembling
heart
my
way
or
must
i
prepare
myself
to
see
her
pause
turn
and
come
back
to
me
with
denial
in
her
looks
the
suspense
of
that
moment
i
shall
never
forget
it
has
never
been
repeated
in
my
experience
never
since
have
i
suffered
so
much
in
any
one
moment
suddenly
it
was
all
over
she
turned
and
i
read
my
doom
in
her
sorrowing
face
you
are
good
she
cried
and
it
would
be
an
infinite
rest
to
be
lifted
out
of
the
agony
i
am
in
and
be
cared
for
by
someone
i
could
perfectly
trust
but
i
can
not
accept
a
devotion
which
fails
to
awaken
in
me
aught
but
simple
gratitude
and
friendliness
unfortunately
for
me
and
perhaps
unfortunately
for
him
whom
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
name
i
have
given
my
whole
heart
she
choked
back
the
words
with
a
certain
wildness
then
she
faced
me
with
mournful
dignity
and
avowed
calmly
and
with
a
certain
finality
which
caused
my
hopes
to
sink
back
into
the
depths
from
which
they
had
so
inconsiderately
sprung
i
have
fixed
my
heart
where
perhaps
i
should
not
pity
me
but
do
not
blame
blame
who
had
committed
the
same
folly
was
suffering
from
the
same
mistake
he
may
be
the
one
true
heart
amongst
them
sometimes
i
think
he
is
sometimes
i
think
his
faults
are
blemishes
upon
a
nature
noble
enough
for
any
love
and
worship
then
doubt
comes
horrible
corroding
doubt
and
i
see
in
him
a
fiend
a
monster
a
being
too
dreadful
to
contemplate
much
less
dream
of
and
adore
oh
if
i
did
but
know
you
shall
know
i
burst
forth
forgetting
my
own
misery
in
hers
i
have
been
selfish
in
urging
my
personal
wishes
upon
you
when
i
should
have
been
occupied
with
yours
henceforth
i
shall
think
only
of
you
to
see
you
happy
to
see
you
at
peace
shall
be
my
joy
and
prove
my
consolation
i
can
not
rejoice
at
the
task
if
task
it
can
be
called
but
from
this
day
on
my
energies
shall
be
devoted
to
the
settling
of
that
doubt
which
while
it
exists
robs
you
of
all
peace
of
mind
if
alfred
is
the
guiltless
man
we
are
fain
to
believe
him
you
shall
know
it
i
feel
that
it
is
possible
to
prove
him
so
and
my
feelings
have
often
been
very
reliable
guides
in
difficult
undertakings
she
was
startled
she
was
more
than
startled
she
was
alarmed
i
do
understand
you
she
cried
what
can
you
do
if
the
one
guilty
heart
among
my
cousins
refuses
to
respond
to
the
appeal
made
to
it
by
my
uncle
how
can
you
hope
to
move
so
callous
a
soul
to
a
sense
of
its
duty
i
can
not
with
the
hand
of
the
law
raised
in
threat
against
him
he
would
be
throwing
away
his
life
to
proclaim
his
guilt
to
anyone
now
it
would
be
folly
on
our
part
to
expect
it
but
there
are
other
means
by
which
this
question
may
be
settled
we
do
not
gather
figs
of
thorns
or
grapes
of
thistles
consider
then
in
which
of
these
three
breasts
the
thorns
are
found
thickest
and
if
uncertainty
yet
remains
to
which
of
your
cousins
your
uncle
death
offered
the
greatest
release
have
i
not
already
asked
myself
these
questions
have
i
not
repeated
them
over
and
over
in
my
own
mind
till
their
ceaseless
repetition
has
maddened
me
i
think
i
know
george
yet
i
dare
not
say
he
has
a
heart
incapable
of
crime
i
think
i
know
alfred
and
i
think
i
know
leighton
but
what
certainty
can
this
imaginary
knowledge
give
me
of
the
integrity
of
men
who
hide
their
best
impulses
under
wild
ways
or
cloud
them
with
plausible
hypocrisies
there
is
not
an
open
soul
among
the
three
and
unless
one
of
them
consents
to
confess
his
crime
we
can
never
feel
sure
of
the
two
true
men
who
are
guiltless
that
is
i
never
can
i
should
be
haunted
by
doubts
just
as
i
am
and
to
be
is
misery
the
depth
of
which
you
can
not
judge
unless
you
know
my
history
and
that
i
can
not
ask
for
i
began
yet
why
should
i
keep
it
from
you
you
have
earned
my
confidence
you
are
and
are
likely
to
remain
my
only
friend
then
why
should
i
hold
back
facts
well
known
to
those
who
come
in
daily
contact
with
me
i
am
unfortunate
in
having
a
father
who
is
no
father
to
me
from
earliest
childhood
till
i
left
him
to
come
to
new
york
i
had
never
received
from
either
parent
a
caress
which
was
more
than
a
formality
my
father
lack
of
sympathy
rose
from
the
mortal
disappointment
he
suffered
when
of
his
two
children
it
was
the
girl
and
not
the
boy
who
survived
the
illness
which
prostrated
both
my
mother
but
i
will
not
talk
of
her
she
has
been
dead
a
dozen
years
only
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
all
tokens
of
affection
were
lacking
to
my
childhood
and
that
the
first
word
expressive
of
warmth
and
protection
came
to
me
from
the
cousin
who
met
me
at
the
train
the
day
i
entered
upon
my
new
life
in
my
dear
uncle
home
do
you
wonder
this
unexpected
tenderness
blinded
me
a
little
to
faults
which
i
had
no
reason
then
to
think
would
ever
develop
into
anything
worse
i
rose
to
leave
my
was
not
strong
enough
for
me
to
bear
up
against
these
repeated
attacks
as
i
did
so
i
said
miss
meredith
you
have
heard
my
promise
may
i
be
prospered
in
my
undertaking
for
success
in
it
means
not
only
satisfaction
to
myself
but
great
relief
to
you
why
do
you
tremble
i
fear
i
dread
your
interference
sometimes
i
wish
never
to
know
the
truth
you
will
call
me
inconsistent
unreasonable
indeed
i
know
i
am
but
what
can
you
expect
from
a
girl
upon
whom
the
blessing
of
god
has
never
rested
this
was
a
new
phase
in
her
nature
the
more
distressing
to
me
that
knowing
little
of
women
i
did
not
understand
her
she
saw
the
effect
of
her
outburst
and
melted
immediately
this
is
a
bad
return
for
your
generosity
she
cried
ascribe
it
to
my
weakness
and
the
dread
i
feel
lest
he
the
guilty
man
i
interposed
is
not
a
subject
for
sympathy
but
he
whom
you
love
is
not
the
guilty
man
i
bravely
assured
her
take
my
word
and
my
hope
for
that
a
man
who
could
win
your
regard
has
no
such
black
spot
in
his
breast
and
bowing
over
her
hand
i
escaped
before
she
could
propound
any
of
the
many
questions
my
declared
purpose
was
likely
to
call
up
book
ii
the
man
xvii
the
monogram
i
had
made
my
promise
to
miss
meredith
with
an
apparent
hopefulness
which
may
have
deceived
her
but
did
not
deceive
myself
when
the
glow
of
my
first
enthusiasm
passed
i
sat
down
in
the
solitude
of
my
own
room
to
reconsider
the
events
of
the
day
but
one
thing
was
clear
to
me
and
that
was
the
unpromising
nature
of
the
task
i
had
set
myself
to
perform
what
excuse
had
i
for
the
i
had
shown
what
means
were
at
my
command
which
were
not
also
at
the
command
of
the
police
she
herself
had
asked
this
same
question
and
i
had
parried
it
but
i
could
not
parry
the
demands
of
my
own
intelligence
they
must
be
met
and
answered
but
how
in
vain
i
pondered
ways
and
means
laid
innumerable
plans
and
relentlessly
discarded
them
projected
interviews
which
i
knew
were
fruitless
and
worked
myself
through
labyrinths
of
reasoning
which
ended
in
nothing
and
left
me
no
farther
advanced
at
the
end
than
i
was
in
the
beginning
wearied
at
last
in
mind
and
body
i
retired
and
during
my
sleep
had
an
inspiration
upon
which
i
proceeded
to
act
early
the
next
morning
revisiting
sam
underhill
apartment
i
told
him
my
difficulty
and
opened
up
my
scheme
sam
underhill
with
all
his
faults
and
numberless
eccentricities
was
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
and
just
the
man
to
respect
my
confidence
he
was
besides
the
only
person
within
the
range
of
my
acquaintances
who
could
assist
me
in
the
plan
i
had
formed
a
plan
which
demanded
the
active
cooperation
of
someone
not
so
well
known
to
the
police
as
myself
hampered
as
i
was
by
my
connection
with
the
gillespie
poisoning
case
i
could
not
personally
make
a
move
towards
the
ravelment
of
its
mystery
without
subjecting
myself
to
the
curiosity
of
the
people
among
whom
my
investigations
might
carry
me
even
if
i
escaped
drawing
upon
myself
the
attention
of
the
district
attorney
office
and
the
suspicion
of
the
men
whose
business
i
was
in
a
measure
attempting
to
usurp
but
he
was
a
free
agent
he
could
come
and
go
without
arousing
distrust
or
awakening
professional
jealousy
at
all
events
he
and
he
alone
could
put
me
into
communication
with
the
private
detective
whom
i
had
decided
to
employ
as
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
visit
sam
rooms
my
presence
there
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
would
raise
no
comment
i
had
only
his
laziness
to
fear
a
laziness
which
with
him
was
as
marked
a
characteristic
as
it
was
with
alfred
gillespie
whom
he
so
carelessly
criticised
seated
with
him
over
an
impromptu
breakfast
i
first
tested
his
good
nature
by
a
sally
or
two
and
finding
it
well
up
to
the
mark
took
him
as
i
have
already
said
sufficiently
into
my
confidence
to
rouse
his
interest
then
i
put
the
blunt
question
which
of
the
three
gillespie
boys
do
you
upon
mature
reflection
consider
the
most
capable
of
the
crime
attributed
to
this
family
his
manner
changed
at
once
oh
come
now
he
cried
do
calculate
upon
putting
me
in
that
box
like
the
rest
of
the
world
i
prefer
to
await
developments
before
committing
myself
on
so
delicate
a
matter
why
outhwaite
prejudice
is
as
bad
as
the
hangman
if
i
had
settled
positively
in
my
own
mind
which
of
the
three
had
emptied
that
phial
of
poison
into
the
old
gentleman
evening
glass
i
would
not
impart
my
convictions
these
fellows
have
enough
to
carry
without
my
throwing
the
least
weight
into
so
trembling
a
balance
i
girded
myself
for
the
struggle
wait
said
i
have
i
fully
made
clear
to
you
miss
position
yes
i
comprehend
that
well
enough
very
well
then
which
is
most
important
to
assist
this
unhappy
woman
to
escape
from
her
anomalous
position
or
to
prevent
prejudice
from
being
formed
in
my
mind
when
you
know
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
me
to
misuse
it
to
my
advantage
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
he
retorted
i
do
know
of
a
fellow
more
likely
to
be
carried
away
by
his
convictions
than
yourself
if
you
were
not
a
lawyer
you
would
be
doing
all
sorts
of
quixotic
things
but
being
hemmed
in
by
professional
conventionalities
you
show
some
restraint
though
not
enough
to
warrant
me
in
trusting
you
with
my
opinion
on
this
matter
since
it
is
only
an
opinion
naturally
i
became
eager
to
know
what
lay
behind
this
break
opinions
are
not
formed
without
some
show
of
reason
and
the
lightest
reason
might
suffice
to
put
me
on
the
track
i
sought
he
saw
my
resolution
in
my
face
and
made
an
effort
to
resist
i
am
as
sorry
as
you
are
for
miss
meredith
he
drawled
helping
me
to
fresh
coffee
if
i
had
seen
her
the
day
she
gave
her
testimony
i
might
be
sorrier
still
but
i
did
not
have
that
pleasure
and
so
am
willing
to
leave
the
matter
with
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
that
justice
is
meted
out
to
the
guilty
do
you
think
their
efforts
are
likely
to
be
successful
oh
the
question
will
be
solved
some
day
do
you
think
so
at
this
repetition
of
the
phrase
which
i
had
made
forcible
by
my
intonation
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
emptying
his
cup
before
answering
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
add
with
nothing
to
go
upon
but
an
accusation
which
while
involving
all
three
of
gillespie
sons
specifies
none
how
can
any
official
action
be
taken
beyond
that
very
ordinary
one
of
submitting
the
whole
household
to
a
continual
surveillance
unless
fresh
evidence
comes
in
or
conscience
drives
the
guilty
to
confession
weeks
months
nay
years
will
go
by
and
the
hand
which
hesitates
to
move
now
will
hesitate
still
justice
needing
something
more
definite
to
go
upon
than
a
suspicion
equally
divided
amongst
three
men
you
are
right
there
but
what
can
you
do
to
better
the
situation
it
appears
to
me
that
you
will
have
to
wait
too
which
contradicts
your
former
assertion
very
possibly
man
is
full
of
contradictions
at
so
early
an
hour
as
this
and
with
only
one
cup
of
coffee
between
him
and
the
possible
nightmare
of
the
night
before
drink
another
cup
then
while
i
tell
you
what
my
hopes
are
guided
by
impressions
which
more
than
once
in
my
life
have
proved
infallible
i
mean
to
run
my
man
down
till
he
succumbs
to
the
pressure
i
will
bring
upon
him
and
confesses
this
i
believe
can
be
done
if
all
my
force
is
concentrated
on
one
man
at
all
events
it
is
the
only
way
i
see
of
attaining
the
desired
end
now
will
you
assist
me
to
choose
the
one
out
of
these
three
most
open
to
attack
i
do
like
it
it
is
against
all
my
principles
but
if
you
must
know
the
exact
state
of
my
feelings
on
this
matter
come
to
these
rooms
at
nine
sharp
and
i
will
allow
you
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
a
certain
acquaintance
of
mine
a
story
which
may
serve
to
give
you
some
enlightenment
he
not
a
man
you
will
want
to
meet
so
i
must
ask
you
to
content
yourself
with
an
easy
chair
in
my
den
will
be
received
in
this
room
and
the
door
yonder
can
be
left
conveniently
open
do
you
object
to
this
arrangement
it
smacks
of
conspiracy
and
other
things
not
altogether
agreeable
but
it
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
at
this
time
and
poor
yox
wo
care
it
your
feelings
i
am
mainly
considering
i
will
be
here
i
doggedly
replied
i
was
resolved
to
let
nothing
not
even
my
prejudices
as
a
gentleman
interfere
with
the
successful
pursuit
of
this
undertaking
will
his
story
contain
any
reference
to
miss
meredith
not
the
least
in
the
world
why
because
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
sit
still
when
i
hear
ladies
spoken
of
in
any
way
short
of
the
deepest
respect
and
you
say
he
is
not
a
gentleman
he
wo
transgress
to
that
degree
if
he
does
trust
to
my
bringing
him
to
order
sorry
i
must
place
an
embargo
on
the
cigars
you
will
find
on
the
table
smoking
on
your
part
would
give
away
your
presence
for
the
man
whose
story
you
are
coming
to
hear
is
one
of
those
fellows
who
smell
a
rat
round
the
corner
in
other
words
he
a
private
detective
with
whom
i
was
once
thrown
in
a
peculiar
way
what
now
perhaps
he
the
very
fellow
i
want
i
have
use
for
a
private
detective
so
i
suppose
this
sentence
so
long
in
coming
was
uttered
in
a
peculiar
way
and
at
the
moment
we
were
rising
from
table
though
i
said
nothing
i
experienced
an
access
of
courage
unpromising
as
sam
manner
had
been
he
was
really
in
sympathy
with
me
and
willing
to
lend
me
a
helping
hand
that
day
the
law
suffered
or
rather
i
should
say
such
clients
as
were
misguided
enough
to
come
to
my
office
the
uncertain
nature
of
the
disclosure
i
awaited
and
the
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
three
brothers
it
would
chiefly
affect
kept
me
restless
up
to
the
hour
set
apart
for
my
return
to
sam
underhill
room
not
till
nine
arrived
and
i
found
myself
in
the
small
apartment
called
his
den
did
i
recover
my
poise
and
show
anything
like
a
steady
countenance
in
the
long
mirror
stretched
above
the
mantel
this
has
always
been
a
characteristic
of
mine
great
agitation
up
to
the
moment
of
action
and
then
an
unnatural
calmness
in
this
case
it
was
an
event
i
awaited
but
the
characteristic
remained
unchanged
sam
underhill
on
the
contrary
never
appeared
more
at
his
ease
i
could
hear
him
singing
between
the
whiffs
of
his
cigar
and
as
i
followed
the
mellow
strains
of
one
of
the
finest
tenors
i
have
ever
known
i
recalled
the
fact
that
i
myself
had
not
sung
a
note
since
the
experience
which
had
made
such
heavy
inroads
into
my
life
was
i
growing
misanthropic
sam
had
not
been
without
his
dark
days
i
remembered
quite
well
all
the
talk
that
went
about
at
the
time
of
his
mad
passion
for
dorothy
loring
that
bewitching
madcap
who
afterwards
found
her
match
in
steve
wilson
and
i
could
not
reconcile
that
disappointment
with
his
present
gaiety
but
these
reflections
can
not
be
of
any
interest
to
my
readers
enough
that
they
occupied
me
at
the
time
and
killed
my
impatience
till
a
sudden
stoppage
in
the
strain
i
objected
to
warned
me
that
the
expected
visitor
had
arrived
i
squared
myself
for
the
ordeal
held
my
breath
and
prepared
to
listen
the
greetings
were
commonplace
sam
is
a
proud
chap
and
does
not
put
himself
out
much
for
anybody
to
this
man
he
scarcely
showed
common
courtesy
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
awakening
distrust
by
any
betrayal
of
interest
in
the
coming
interview
perhaps
he
recognised
that
a
barely
civil
greeting
was
all
the
man
expected
or
desired
halloo
yox
good
evening
mr
underhill
did
i
ask
you
to
call
on
me
you
certainly
did
underhill
and
set
the
hour
well
well
i
suppose
you
are
correct
sit
down
my
memory
is
not
much
longer
than
this
cigar
which
you
may
observe
is
almost
smoked
up
have
one
yox
you
wo
get
a
better
in
your
shop
and
now
what
have
you
come
to
tell
me
not
much
dennison
bought
seven
shares
last
tuesday
and
little
invested
in
as
many
more
yesterday
both
men
show
confidence
and
report
will
be
all
you
can
wish
good
how
much
do
i
owe
you
will
that
do
i
heard
a
rustle
then
a
short
laugh
preceding
the
remark
you
might
halve
it
and
still
please
me
oh
i
take
it
not
too
much
grist
comes
to
my
mill
here
there
was
a
silence
underhill
was
evidently
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
when
they
spoke
again
it
was
to
drift
into
generalities
to
which
i
listened
with
an
impatience
in
marked
contrast
to
the
complacency
of
sam
who
seemed
just
too
tired
to
live
that
is
if
i
could
judge
from
his
tone
and
the
total
absence
of
interest
he
expressed
in
anything
said
either
by
himself
or
his
somewhat
vulgar
guest
but
suddenly
there
was
a
change
not
in
underhill
whose
voice
was
even
more
languishing
than
before
but
in
myself
for
i
heard
sam
remark
between
two
prolonged
whiffs
what
is
that
story
you
were
trying
to
tell
me
the
other
night
about
the
row
in
lower
street
i
thought
it
promised
to
be
interesting
at
the
time
but
the
other
fellows
were
in
such
a
hurry
i
stay
to
hear
it
out
tell
it
again
yox
just
as
you
did
then
perhaps
it
will
wake
me
up
the
answer
came
more
quickly
than
i
expected
oh
that
well
i
do
mind
it
was
a
curious
adventure
and
brought
me
too
near
the
police
for
me
to
forget
it
in
a
hurry
i
wish
i
knew
who
that
fellow
was
did
i
show
you
the
i
found
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
gave
me
the
monogram
never
mind
the
monogram
we
talk
about
that
afterwards
broke
in
sam
in
the
sleepiest
tones
imaginable
i
do
care
so
much
about
the
man
as
the
way
he
acted
this
struck
me
as
being
strange
for
a
gentleman
but
begin
yox
you
relate
adventures
well
i
have
heard
you
talk
more
than
once
yox
who
was
not
above
flattery
hemmed
hawed
and
launched
out
in
the
following
tale
i
transcribe
his
words
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
them
at
first
he
did
not
interest
me
much
you
see
i
had
business
at
old
mother
merry
do
you
know
the
place
it
not
likely
so
i
will
describe
it
you
need
to
know
something
about
it
in
order
to
understand
my
story
it
an
old
or
rather
that
was
its
use
once
now
a
sort
of
standing
half
on
the
dock
and
half
on
piles
somewhere
down
near
street
i
like
the
place
that
is
it
has
a
mysterious
air
which
we
fellows
do
object
to
seen
from
the
docks
and
in
daylight
it
has
the
appearance
of
four
squat
walls
without
windows
but
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
crawl
around
on
the
river
side
you
will
find
two
glazed
loopholes
overlooking
the
water
one
on
the
lower
story
and
one
under
the
roof
there
is
also
i
am
told
a
or
two
up
above
but
i
ca
swear
to
that
by
night
the
one
bright
glimmer
you
see
on
getting
near
it
shines
through
the
door
this
stands
open
in
the
summer
or
rather
the
upper
half
of
it
does
for
it
is
made
in
two
parts
like
the
old
dutch
ones
you
see
in
the
pictures
but
in
winter
time
an
agreeable
light
shines
through
the
four
small
holes
arranged
along
the
top
half
a
calico
curtain
blows
in
and
out
of
this
door
on
such
nights
as
we
have
been
having
lately
for
mother
merry
likes
a
fire
and
the
little
stove
she
sits
at
netting
heats
the
one
big
room
below
to
smotheration
and
the
men
wo
stand
it
if
this
curtain
blows
high
you
can
if
you
nervy
enough
get
a
peep
at
the
inside
stewing
with
a
horrible
smell
of
fish
and
bright
with
kerosene
lamps
and
the
busy
little
stove
you
wo
see
much
furniture
for
mother
merry
do
spend
her
money
on
anything
she
can
do
without
but
there
is
a
table
or
two
and
some
chairs
and
in
one
of
the
corners
a
door
which
sometimes
stands
half
open
but
more
often
is
to
be
seen
tight
shut
behind
this
door
whatever
mischief
the
house
hides
takes
place
you
can
tell
this
from
the
old
woman
eye
which
is
always
on
it
and
if
you
know
her
well
it
is
quite
enough
to
watch
her
twitching
underlip
to
satisfy
yourself
as
to
whether
the
mischief
is
big
or
little
prosperous
in
its
character
or
of
a
kind
likely
to
damage
her
reputation
and
empty
her
pockets
she
is
no
fool
this
old
mother
merry
and
though
she
has
not
much
of
what
we
men
call
nerve
and
trembles
like
a
leaf
at
the
approach
of
a
policeman
she
has
more
control
than
you
would
think
over
the
tough
crowd
of
boatmen
who
knock
their
heads
together
in
that
little
room
i
have
even
been
told
that
she
is
feared
quite
beyond
all
reason
by
the
few
stray
females
who
find
a
refuge
in
the
scanty
garret
rooms
which
have
given
to
this
shanty
the
highfalutin
name
of
what
harm
goes
on
under
her
twinkling
red
eye
i
do
not
know
i
have
been
in
the
place
altogether
three
times
but
have
never
yet
found
out
what
that
door
conceals
the
men
play
at
some
sort
of
game
around
a
large
table
on
which
black
bottles
and
thick
glasses
take
up
as
much
room
as
the
cards
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
gambling
only
which
makes
it
next
to
impossible
for
a
fellow
to
get
in
there
at
night
there
is
something
else
but
i
stop
over
that
it
is
a
hell
of
a
place
as
you
can
judge
and
unless
one
business
led
him
there
scarcely
a
spot
where
a
man
would
brag
of
being
found
one
night
the
night
i
am
telling
you
about
i
got
in
but
got
in
late
there
was
some
sort
of
password
necessary
and
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
hold
of
it
and
a
harder
time
yet
making
old
mother
merry
hear
it
when
i
had
got
hold
of
it
yet
she
is
deaf
and
does
pretend
to
be
this
trouble
over
and
the
door
passed
i
encountered
another
check
a
man
was
there
a
slouchy
disreputable
wretch
and
it
was
he
instead
of
mother
merry
who
was
watching
that
mysterious
door
which
for
once
stood
far
enough
ajar
for
one
room
to
share
the
smells
sights
and
uproar
of
the
other
i
did
not
like
this
man
i
did
not
like
the
way
he
stood
or
looked
or
held
his
tongue
there
was
something
peculiar
and
unnatural
in
his
whole
manner
and
i
glanced
at
mother
merry
to
see
what
she
thought
of
him
evidently
nothing
bad
for
she
moved
about
quite
and
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
the
door
i
had
never
before
seen
her
let
out
of
her
sight
a
moment
can
he
be
i
naturally
asked
myself
a
little
put
out
by
my
doubts
for
my
business
would
soon
take
me
into
the
inner
room
and
i
did
not
like
to
imagine
myself
under
his
eye
i
suddenly
shouted
to
see
if
i
could
make
any
impression
on
him
but
i
might
as
well
have
shouted
at
a
mother
merry
brought
me
whiskey
but
the
man
did
not
budge
i
began
to
think
of
putting
off
my
affair
to
a
more
convenient
season
when
i
was
taken
with
a
sudden
curiosity
to
see
just
what
he
was
staring
at
approaching
gently
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
a
portion
of
the
inside
room
was
all
i
could
see
but
in
that
portion
sat
a
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
cruel
jaw
it
was
this
face
which
held
the
attention
of
the
boatman
before
me
and
while
i
was
wondering
what
he
found
in
it
to
hold
him
for
so
long
i
heard
a
sigh
escape
from
under
the
coarse
jacket
i
dreaded
touching
with
my
own
and
much
amazed
at
this
show
of
feeling
in
a
den
of
such
filth
and
wickedness
i
moved
back
to
where
mother
merry
stood
and
whispered
in
her
ear
that
man
do
you
know
him
has
he
any
business
here
her
gaunt
shoulders
lifted
in
a
shrug
she
is
far
from
jolly
cheerful
as
her
name
is
then
she
drew
near
the
man
and
i
saw
her
touch
him
at
that
or
some
low
words
she
uttered
he
roused
and
cast
a
quick
look
about
him
then
he
pointed
towards
a
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
answered
by
a
nod
and
he
moved
off
with
a
poor
try
at
a
slouchy
gait
when
i
saw
this
i
knew
he
was
no
sailor
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
a
sound
of
women
screaming
and
scolding
came
from
the
docks
then
a
child
cry
cut
into
the
night
after
which
there
was
quiet
in
that
quarter
and
in
the
house
too
for
mother
merry
with
a
scared
look
jumped
towards
the
room
where
the
men
were
sitting
and
pushing
her
way
in
held
up
her
hand
so
as
to
draw
all
eyes
warning
she
cried
the
cops
see
if
you
can
get
out
by
the
window
one
of
the
men
arose
and
went
to
the
window
looked
out
and
came
crawling
back
putting
out
a
light
as
he
did
so
on
the
water
he
whispered
and
whether
i
am
a
fool
or
not
that
whisper
sent
the
creeps
up
my
back
front
and
back
she
cried
means
business
you
have
to
squeeze
into
the
hole
boys
another
light
went
out
meanwhile
i
had
crept
to
the
door
there
that
fellow
trying
to
sneak
shouted
a
voice
i
drew
back
old
merry
came
to
my
aid
be
a
fool
she
whispered
here
or
they
think
in
with
them
the
growl
of
some
of
them
brought
the
warning
home
i
laughed
and
got
in
line
with
the
boys
grumbling
aloud
as
i
did
so
they
make
a
mistake
if
you
are
wanted
by
the
cops
i
am
too
but
how
about
that
other
fellow
i
whispered
getting
close
to
mother
merry
in
the
hubbub
she
did
hear
me
she
was
telling
how
something
was
to
be
done
then
another
light
went
out
the
place
now
was
in
nearly
total
darkness
came
from
the
doorway
where
the
curtain
blew
in
and
out
and
quick
came
in
hoarse
echo
from
mother
merry
quivering
lips
suddenly
the
room
was
empty
of
the
drunken
figures
i
had
seen
moving
about
me
the
minute
before
not
one
was
in
sight
i
heard
a
creak
then
a
scuffle
and
then
a
bang
and
the
room
stood
empty
only
a
few
bottles
and
a
pack
or
two
of
cards
were
left
on
the
dirty
top
of
the
old
pine
table
as
proof
that
a
tough
crowd
had
been
there
raising
cain
the
old
woman
cleared
the
table
and
shoved
the
lot
into
a
cupboard
then
she
sat
down
never
have
i
seen
a
woman
so
steady
and
at
the
same
time
so
frightened
is
room
for
one
more
she
quickly
said
pointing
to
where
the
men
had
disappeared
over
the
water
and
the
floor
is
full
of
holes
but
the
police
have
got
on
to
it
yet
will
you
go
down
was
with
the
crowd
i
told
her
wo
help
you
you
in
the
house
ah
it
was
almost
a
cry
she
gave
the
door
to
the
upper
rooms
had
opened
and
the
sailor
who
had
struck
me
as
such
a
peculiar
chap
stood
in
the
room
before
us
forgot
she
wailed
out
am
i
to
do
with
the
sailor
who
was
no
sailor
stared
straight
before
him
as
well
he
might
for
he
had
left
a
lighted
room
and
found
a
dark
one
yet
in
that
stare
there
was
a
look
of
pain
easily
to
be
seen
by
the
light
thrown
out
by
the
stove
he
did
mind
mother
merry
cry
he
had
something
else
on
his
mind
he
looked
like
a
man
suddenly
wakened
up
and
i
had
a
strange
idea
that
his
dreams
if
he
had
had
them
held
him
just
then
in
a
closer
grip
than
the
facts
he
had
come
among
it
so
late
he
sighed
and
i
started
for
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
gentleman
the
words
and
the
way
he
said
them
seemed
to
bring
fresh
trouble
to
mother
merry
the
she
wailed
cops
are
at
the
door
the
place
has
been
threatened
for
a
month
and
they
are
closing
round
will
you
face
them
or
shall
i
open
the
trap
again
oh
do
she
groaned
as
he
gave
a
sudden
reel
backward
makes
me
feel
wicked
i
ought
to
have
warned
you
would
have
made
no
difference
he
said
should
still
have
gone
up
help
me
if
you
can
and
remember
what
you
have
sworn
i
will
send
money
o
god
o
god
to
leave
can
not
leave
hark
that
is
the
second
signal
in
another
moment
they
will
be
here
do
you
want
to
fall
into
their
hands
had
rather
die
quick
some
place
money
is
no
object
let
that
fellow
i
see
over
there
help
me
he
looks
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
the
police
let
him
change
togs
with
me
am
a
private
detective
i
whispered
going
very
close
to
him
in
the
dark
name
is
yox
and
you
will
find
papers
to
support
the
name
and
business
in
my
coat
pocket
they
may
hold
you
for
a
day
but
no
longer
and
i
handed
over
my
coat
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
confide
my
name
to
you
with
the
same
ease
i
do
this
coat
he
replied
as
he
threw
me
the
garment
which
had
so
disfigured
him
my
name
is
the
secret
i
would
defend
with
my
life
say
that
you
are
benjamin
jones
fork
over
the
cash
which
you
say
is
no
object
to
you
i
cried
must
trust
me
for
that
he
answered
i
get
off
without
discovery
you
will
receive
a
hundred
dollars
at
your
address
within
the
week
i
have
left
all
i
had
above
i
muttered
will
pay
mother
merry
assured
me
here
my
cap
i
grumbled
not
any
too
well
pleased
he
took
it
and
though
it
was
a
common
one
enough
he
looked
like
another
man
in
it
me
in
my
character
he
ordered
just
as
that
blowing
curtain
was
caught
and
held
back
by
a
hand
from
without
and
the
face
of
a
policeman
looked
in
there
lamps
up
was
the
order
we
got
a
light
flashed
over
us
from
the
doorway
the
man
at
my
side
advanced
to
meet
it
and
i
saw
him
talking
with
the
officer
who
had
pushed
his
head
through
the
upper
half
of
the
door
then
everything
about
and
before
me
became
mixed
in
the
rush
the
police
made
from
every
side
and
i
failed
to
see
anything
again
for
some
minutes
when
a
minute
quiet
came
about
again
and
i
had
the
chance
to
use
my
eyes
i
did
not
find
the
man
to
whom
i
had
lent
my
coat
and
my
name
he
had
been
allowed
to
slip
away
but
i
had
no
such
luck
the
place
being
turned
over
and
only
a
few
women
found
they
turned
on
me
but
i
was
game
and
was
soon
able
to
show
them
i
was
one
of
their
own
sort
at
which
there
naturally
came
the
question
as
to
who
the
other
fellow
was
but
i
did
not
help
them
out
on
this
and
it
ended
in
my
being
taken
to
jefferson
market
with
the
rest
we
all
got
off
next
day
and
without
much
trouble
i
have
always
thought
that
fellow
paid
the
fines
at
all
events
one
week
from
that
day
i
found
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
lying
on
my
desk
at
the
office
it
contained
bills
to
the
amount
agreed
upon
now
underhill
who
was
this
man
i
have
been
asking
myself
that
question
ever
since
i
pocketed
his
money
the
fellow
who
can
pay
out
hundreds
like
that
is
a
man
to
know
i
waited
for
the
answer
which
was
slow
in
coming
but
then
underhill
was
always
slow
when
he
did
speak
it
was
lazily
enough
did
you
say
you
had
some
clue
to
his
identity
a
or
something
of
that
kind
which
you
found
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
gave
you
yes
i
have
that
and
that
there
were
initials
on
it
which
you
had
not
been
able
to
decipher
oh
yes
initials
but
what
can
a
fellow
make
out
of
initials
not
much
of
course
have
you
that
with
you
i
just
have
i
sport
it
everywhere
i
think
so
much
of
it
i
have
even
talked
of
having
my
name
changed
to
fit
the
letters
of
this
monogram
let
me
see
it
will
you
the
fellow
drew
it
out
a
minute
passed
then
underhill
drawled
out
it
not
as
easy
to
make
out
as
i
expected
will
you
let
me
compare
it
with
a
collection
i
have
in
a
book
here
i
may
have
its
mate
sure
sir
underhill
came
my
way
the
sudden
heat
into
which
i
was
thrown
by
this
unexpected
move
acted
as
a
double
warning
i
must
beware
of
and
i
must
take
care
not
to
give
away
my
presence
to
the
man
whose
perspicacity
i
had
reason
to
dread
i
therefore
rose
as
quietly
as
possible
and
met
entering
figure
with
a
silent
inquiry
nicely
adjusted
to
the
interest
i
was
supposed
to
feel
in
the
matter
he
was
no
less
careful
but
there
was
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
as
he
handed
over
to
my
inspection
the
he
had
just
taken
from
yox
which
contradicted
his
air
of
unconsciousness
and
led
me
to
inspect
with
great
interest
the
monogram
he
displayed
to
my
notice
it
was
by
no
means
a
simple
one
as
you
will
see
by
the
copy
illustration
as
i
studied
it
underhill
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
paper
lying
open
on
the
table
i
have
seen
that
a
dozen
times
then
separating
the
letters
of
the
monogram
he
wrote
them
out
in
a
string
thus
l
l
d
g
leighton
gillespie
i
inquired
in
a
kind
of
soundless
whisper
leighton
le
droit
gillespie
he
wrote
it
was
the
name
with
which
my
own
mind
was
full
the
name
with
which
it
had
been
full
ever
since
the
inquest
xviii
the
phial
the
moment
was
not
propitious
for
a
fuller
understanding
between
us
sam
lowered
the
light
and
sauntered
back
into
the
outer
room
remarking
lazily
to
yox
if
i
were
you
i
would
sport
this
thing
around
too
openly
if
judiciously
kept
out
of
sight
it
may
bring
you
in
another
hundred
some
day
how
that
you
know
those
initials
know
louis
le
duc
gracieux
well
rather
but
as
long
as
you
have
not
the
honour
keep
quiet
lie
low
and
await
events
that
is
if
you
care
about
the
money
what
have
you
done
with
the
blouse
put
it
away
in
cotton
oh
i
see
well
put
the
with
it
i
will
have
another
cigar
thank
you
i
do
often
have
such
a
snap
well
what
is
it
sir
oh
nothing
i
thought
you
looked
as
if
you
wanted
something
from
me
i
not
the
least
in
the
world
silence
then
a
lazy
movement
on
the
part
of
sam
which
disturbed
something
on
the
table
at
which
they
were
sitting
the
small
noise
had
the
effect
of
eliciting
another
word
from
sam
i
thought
your
story
had
more
to
it
when
i
heard
it
last
did
you
say
something
about
a
small
parcel
which
this
mysterious
man
took
out
of
his
pocket
before
handing
over
his
blouse
perhaps
but
that
was
anything
i
wonder
you
remember
it
long
silence
on
the
part
of
sam
i
never
forget
anything
he
observed
at
last
was
it
a
big
parcel
or
a
little
it
was
a
small
one
how
small
oh
a
thing
a
man
could
hold
in
his
fist
why
do
you
ask
about
it
whim
i
am
trying
to
wake
myself
up
what
was
the
shape
of
this
parcel
bless
me
if
i
given
two
thoughts
to
it
you
get
that
blessing
yox
for
you
given
more
than
two
thoughts
to
it
i
yes
or
why
should
you
have
described
it
as
minutely
as
you
did
the
other
night
did
i
undoubtedly
i
can
even
recall
your
words
you
said
the
fellow
was
pretty
well
shaken
up
for
a
man
of
his
size
and
appearance
and
after
handing
you
the
blouse
he
caught
it
back
and
took
something
out
of
one
of
the
pockets
it
looked
like
one
of
those
phials
the
homoeopaths
use
you
see
you
were
inclined
to
be
more
dramatic
on
that
occasion
than
on
this
indeed
i
have
been
a
little
disappointed
in
you
oh
well
a
fellow
can
not
always
cut
a
figure
i
try
to
remember
the
bottle
next
time
i
tell
the
story
sam
did
not
answer
i
heard
him
yawn
instead
but
i
did
not
yawn
that
word
phial
had
effectually
roused
me
as
you
say
it
is
a
small
matter
underhill
finally
drawled
so
is
the
straw
that
turns
the
current
he
was
a
philosopher
who
said
little
rift
within
the
lute
etc
then
suddenly
and
with
a
air
which
evidently
startled
his
companion
do
you
suppose
yox
that
mother
merry
runs
an
in
those
upper
rooms
the
answer
he
received
evidently
startled
him
she
may
i
had
thought
of
it
before
but
i
remember
now
that
when
those
women
were
brought
down
there
was
amongst
them
one
who
certainly
was
under
the
influence
of
something
worse
than
liquor
faugh
i
see
her
yet
but
it
was
opium
he
had
in
that
bottle
that
is
not
the
opium
which
is
used
for
smoking
the
firelight
shone
full
upon
it
as
he
passed
it
from
one
pocket
to
another
and
i
saw
distinctly
the
sparkle
of
some
dark
liquid
sam
underhill
who
seemed
to
have
fallen
back
into
his
old
condition
of
sleepy
interest
mumbled
something
about
his
having
been
able
to
see
a
good
deal
considering
the
darkness
of
the
place
to
which
his
now
possibly
suspicious
visitor
replied
i
would
have
seen
more
if
i
had
known
so
much
was
to
be
got
out
of
it
can
you
give
me
a
point
or
two
as
to
how
i
to
get
that
extra
hundred
whereupon
sam
retorted
not
in
a
way
to
close
the
conversation
as
soon
as
the
man
had
left
i
rushed
in
upon
sam
without
ceremony
he
was
still
sitting
at
the
table
smoking
and
received
me
with
a
look
of
mingled
amusement
and
anxiety
how
did
the
comedy
strike
you
he
asked
i
attempted
a
shrug
which
failed
before
his
imperturbable
nonchalance
how
did
it
strike
you
he
persisted
as
cleverly
carried
out
but
not
so
cleverly
that
the
fellow
will
not
suspect
it
to
be
a
comedy
oh
well
so
long
as
he
does
not
associate
the
right
name
with
those
four
initials
we
are
safe
and
he
wo
i
know
yox
well
enough
for
that
then
you
know
him
for
a
fool
louis
gracieux
who
is
louis
gracieux
besides
the
phial
why
the
whole
town
is
talking
about
a
phial
i
know
but
not
about
a
that
is
worth
another
hundred
dollars
to
the
man
holding
it
yox
is
a
member
of
the
regular
police
he
in
business
for
himself
which
means
he
in
it
for
what
he
can
make
now
he
knows
or
rather
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
made
him
see
that
there
is
more
to
be
got
out
of
this
matter
by
circumspection
and
a
close
tongue
than
by
bragging
of
his
good
luck
and
giving
every
ass
about
him
a
chance
to
chew
upon
those
letters
oh
he
keep
quiet
now
for
a
week
or
two
at
least
after
that
i
can
not
promise
do
you
think
his
version
of
this
affair
reliable
absolutely
he
would
have
exaggerated
more
if
he
had
been
forcing
an
invention
upon
us
i
sat
down
and
regarding
underhill
across
the
table
remarked
somewhat
pointedly
now
that
the
name
has
been
mentioned
between
us
we
can
talk
more
openly
what
date
have
you
been
able
to
give
to
yox
adventure
you
surely
have
not
failed
to
get
from
him
the
day
he
went
down
to
mother
merry
sam
rose
he
who
detested
rising
and
going
to
a
little
side
table
where
a
pile
of
newspapers
lay
he
pulled
off
the
top
one
and
laid
it
open
before
me
taking
care
however
to
stretch
his
arm
across
the
upper
margin
in
a
way
to
cover
up
effectually
the
date
read
said
he
pointing
to
a
paragraph
i
followed
his
finger
and
read
out
a
brief
account
of
the
descent
which
had
been
made
on
mother
merry
and
a
description
of
the
proceedings
which
had
ended
in
the
release
of
the
women
involved
now
take
a
look
at
the
date
he
went
on
lifting
his
arm
i
did
so
it
was
a
memorable
one
the
evening
of
death
the
affair
at
mother
merry
took
place
on
the
preceding
night
commented
sam
there
was
no
languishing
note
in
his
voice
now
i
sat
silent
when
i
did
speak
it
was
plainly
and
decidedly
i
see
what
you
mean
you
think
he
went
to
that
place
to
get
the
acid
sam
puffed
away
at
his
cigar
it
has
been
a
mystery
to
everyone
where
that
acid
came
from
i
continued
a
mystery
which
has
evidently
baffled
the
police
if
a
druggist
in
the
whole
range
of
this
great
city
had
lately
sold
a
phial
of
this
poison
to
anyone
answering
the
description
given
of
these
brothers
we
would
have
heard
from
him
before
now
equally
so
if
a
doctor
had
prescribed
it
a
second
daniel
come
to
judgment
quoth
sam
sententiously
and
now
we
through
chance
or
special
providence
perhaps
have
stumbled
upon
a
clue
as
to
how
this
deadly
drug
may
have
entered
the
gillespie
family
i
regret
to
agree
with
you
but
that
is
the
way
it
looks
but
outhwaite
you
must
remember
and
as
a
lawyer
you
will
that
a
long
and
tangled
road
lies
between
mere
supposition
and
the
establishment
of
a
fact
like
this
this
phial
so
carefully
transferred
from
a
pocket
where
a
seemingly
more
valuable
article
lay
hid
has
not
been
identified
as
holding
poison
only
as
holding
a
liquid
much
less
has
it
been
proven
to
be
the
bottle
found
under
the
clock
in
the
gillespie
all
very
true
yet
this
fellow
story
of
well
let
us
say
louis
appearance
and
conduct
in
this
more
than
doubtful
place
warrants
us
in
thinking
the
worst
of
his
errand
i
felt
the
force
of
this
suggestion
quite
true
i
assented
then
in
some
agitation
for
my
thoughts
were
divided
between
the
relief
which
a
knowledge
of
this
occurrences
might
bring
to
hope
and
the
terrible
results
to
the
man
himself
i
went
on
to
say
his
little
girl
you
never
saw
his
little
girl
sam
well
she
a
creature
and
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
had
her
arms
about
his
neck
do
talk
about
children
he
hastily
objected
you
make
a
muff
of
me
and
then
i
remembered
he
had
a
great
weakness
for
children
i
had
rather
you
talk
about
miss
meredith
nothing
but
the
interest
i
take
in
the
peculiar
position
held
by
this
young
lady
gives
me
the
requisite
courage
to
stir
in
this
matter
i
have
known
those
boys
too
long
and
too
well
that
is
i
have
drunk
too
many
bottles
with
george
and
sat
out
too
many
nights
in
full
view
of
alfred
handsome
figure
stretched
out
in
the
mysterious
apathy
i
have
alluded
to
with
leighton
i
have
fewer
associations
but
i
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
know
perfectly
well
the
which
yox
handed
out
do
you
suppose
there
was
anything
in
those
pockets
besides
the
anything
i
mean
calculated
to
give
away
the
wearer
of
that
foul
blouse
no
if
there
had
been
if
in
other
words
he
had
found
anything
there
which
suggested
a
member
of
the
gillespie
family
he
would
never
have
aired
the
matter
in
the
presence
of
their
friends
he
would
have
gone
at
once
to
the
police
or
endeavoured
to
make
such
capital
out
of
it
as
such
a
find
would
suggest
then
you
really
think
he
does
not
know
that
the
tools
he
is
playing
with
have
mighty
sharp
edges
i
am
confident
he
does
not
that
is
a
relief
yet
he
can
not
remain
in
such
ignorance
long
if
i
call
him
to
my
assistance
that
depends
how
depends
upon
what
you
want
him
to
do
for
this
i
had
no
answer
my
plans
were
as
vague
as
the
wandering
curling
upward
at
that
instant
from
my
neglected
cigar
you
have
never
liked
leighton
i
remarked
in
the
hope
of
adjusting
my
thoughts
before
entering
upon
the
more
serious
portion
of
this
conversation
neither
have
i
since
surprising
a
very
strange
expression
on
his
face
the
night
of
his
father
death
yet
of
the
people
who
knew
him
would
tell
you
that
he
is
a
good
man
a
very
good
man
the
best
of
the
three
by
far
notwithstanding
his
low
associates
i
ventured
notwithstanding
everything
people
are
so
deceived
by
a
few
words
uttered
in
that
their
judgment
is
apt
to
be
blunted
to
the
real
character
of
a
man
like
leighton
gillespie
he
must
be
an
odd
one
i
observed
the
lights
and
shades
of
such
a
nature
are
past
finding
out
in
appearance
and
manner
he
is
a
gentleman
yet
if
yox
story
is
true
he
finds
no
difficulty
in
visiting
the
worst
of
places
under
circumstances
and
in
a
garb
which
bespeaks
a
personal
interest
in
them
the
nature
of
that
interest
we
have
dared
to
infer
from
the
part
played
in
his
visit
by
the
mysterious
phial
but
how
account
for
such
instincts
such
murderous
impulses
in
a
man
brought
up
as
he
has
been
the
motive
must
have
been
a
serious
one
to
drive
a
man
of
his
connections
into
crime
can
you
name
it
was
it
the
need
of
money
a
craving
for
perfect
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
strange
courses
unchecked
or
just
the
malice
of
a
revengeful
spirit
cherishing
some
rankling
grudge
which
only
the
death
of
its
object
could
satisfy
do
not
ask
me
i
not
going
to
supply
facts
and
reasons
too
in
this
matter
what
going
yes
i
never
don
my
to
any
purpose
save
in
privacy
and
under
the
influences
emanating
from
my
own
room
and
its
familiar
surroundings
very
good
you
shall
seek
such
inspiration
as
is
to
be
found
there
in
just
another
moment
but
first
let
me
give
you
a
little
further
insight
into
the
character
of
the
man
we
are
discussing
this
is
something
i
saw
myself
one
day
last
fall
i
was
going
down
west
broadway
when
i
came
upon
leighton
gillespie
standing
near
an
elegant
turnout
talking
with
an
and
bedraggled
woman
as
philanthropy
is
his
fad
and
occurrences
of
this
kind
a
common
affair
with
him
i
was
passing
by
with
no
further
display
of
interest
than
an
inward
sneer
when
i
noted
his
expression
and
stopped
short
if
not
from
sympathy
at
least
in
some
curiosity
as
to
the
woman
who
could
draw
it
forth
outhwaite
she
was
a
panting
creature
with
hair
and
nervously
working
lips
not
beautiful
not
even
interesting
to
me
but
he
well
i
have
seen
few
faces
look
as
his
did
then
and
when
she
started
to
run
as
she
presently
did
he
caught
at
the
muddy
shawl
she
wore
and
pulled
her
back
as
if
his
very
life
depended
upon
restraining
her
at
his
side
i
even
saw
him
take
that
shawl
in
his
hand
such
a
shawl
i
would
not
have
touched
it
for
a
champagne
supper
and
there
have
been
times
when
he
has
shown
himself
more
squeamish
on
some
subjects
than
i
but
he
was
not
squeamish
now
far
from
it
for
he
not
only
held
that
shawl
but
fumbled
with
it
almost
clung
to
it
talking
all
the
while
with
voluble
persistency
at
last
he
asked
her
some
questions
which
brought
out
a
passionate
refusal
but
if
discouraged
he
did
not
show
it
on
the
contrary
he
continued
his
plea
with
increasing
earnestness
and
finally
pointed
to
his
carriage
she
gave
it
one
look
and
shrank
back
with
a
gesture
of
fear
then
she
grew
steadier
and
her
head
fell
forward
on
her
breast
he
went
on
pleading
with
her
and
then
i
saw
a
strange
sight
with
an
air
such
as
only
a
swell
like
himself
is
capable
of
assuming
he
signalled
to
his
driver
to
draw
up
at
the
curbstone
before
him
then
as
he
might
hand
in
one
of
the
four
hundred
he
handed
her
in
and
took
his
seat
beside
her
not
a
look
to
the
right
nor
left
he
was
simply
the
perfect
gentleman
and
obnoxious
as
he
had
always
been
to
me
up
to
that
hour
i
could
not
but
respect
his
manner
if
not
himself
it
was
admirable
and
so
was
that
of
the
man
who
sat
upon
the
box
though
the
latter
must
have
cringed
when
that
disreputable
foot
struck
the
step
and
what
might
be
called
a
bundle
of
rags
entered
among
his
pearl
satin
cushions
he
did
not
turn
a
hair
or
lose
a
jot
of
that
serene
absorption
in
his
own
affairs
which
characterises
all
the
gillespie
coachmen
i
watched
him
expressly
to
see
a
valuable
fellow
that
for
a
master
of
the
eccentric
tastes
of
leighton
gillespie
you
interest
me
said
i
did
you
watch
them
drive
off
yes
and
stood
there
staring
till
they
were
half
down
the
block
for
she
had
not
accepted
the
situation
with
the
same
ease
as
himself
and
i
felt
that
something
would
happen
and
there
did
before
the
polished
panels
were
lost
to
my
sight
the
door
burst
open
and
i
saw
her
wild
figure
jump
out
and
plunge
away
in
the
direction
of
the
river
this
time
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
her
the
carriage
rolled
on
and
he
with
it
nor
did
he
do
what
i
would
have
done
let
the
door
stand
open
till
the
air
of
that
carriage
had
been
purged
of
its
late
unwholesome
occupant
altogether
it
was
an
odd
experience
what
do
you
make
out
of
it
outhwaite
he
a
fellow
who
will
bear
studying
is
he
always
so
respectful
to
the
paupers
he
befriends
sam
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
related
my
sole
experience
with
leighton
gillespie
in
his
of
philanthropist
my
other
memories
of
him
suggest
simply
the
millionaire
son
illustration
i
saw
her
wild
figure
jump
out
and
plunge
away
in
the
direction
of
the
river
xix
i
make
my
first
move
to
attempt
to
fathom
such
a
nature
as
this
leads
to
little
but
mental
confusion
before
i
had
spent
a
in
trying
to
untangle
the
knotty
problem
offered
by
leighton
gillespie
opposing
characteristics
i
decided
to
follow
the
example
of
my
friend
underhill
and
keep
to
facts
these
in
themselves
were
startling
enough
to
occupy
my
mind
and
convince
me
absolutely
of
leighton
guilt
but
this
was
not
convincing
miss
meredith
probabilities
possibilities
even
which
might
satisfy
me
would
count
for
but
little
with
her
with
her
nice
sense
of
justice
she
would
demand
a
positive
and
unbroken
chain
of
evidence
before
she
would
allow
herself
to
acknowledge
the
guilt
of
the
man
whose
innocence
i
presumed
to
challenge
and
this
clear
and
unbroken
chain
i
did
not
have
how
then
could
i
strengthen
the
evidence
just
obtained
not
by
showing
motive
there
seemed
to
be
no
motive
to
be
sure
leighton
was
in
debt
so
were
they
all
and
he
was
known
to
have
quarrelled
bitterly
with
his
father
more
than
once
but
these
were
not
new
facts
nor
were
they
sufficiently
condemnatory
to
settle
even
in
her
mind
the
torturing
question
embodied
in
that
one
word
already
alluded
to
which
something
of
an
absolutely
criminating
character
must
be
found
against
this
man
some
proof
so
direct
and
unanswerable
that
even
her
scrupulous
conscience
would
be
satisfied
something
like
positive
evidence
say
that
he
had
visited
mother
merry
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
in
secret
the
poison
he
dared
not
buy
openly
or
that
the
glass
of
sherry
he
poured
out
for
his
father
had
held
poison
as
well
as
wine
as
all
attempts
to
establish
this
latter
fact
had
proved
abortive
as
the
police
had
not
only
failed
to
prove
that
such
a
mixture
had
been
made
but
to
settle
the
exact
medium
by
means
of
which
gillespie
received
the
poison
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
easier
task
and
decided
to
concentrate
my
energies
upon
establishing
the
fact
that
the
bottle
carried
from
mother
merry
by
the
sailor
contained
prussic
acid
and
that
this
sailor
was
positively
the
man
we
supposed
him
to
be
leighton
gillespie
with
these
facts
indubitably
established
even
miss
meredith
must
feel
that
the
man
who
could
be
guilty
of
obtaining
a
deadly
drug
through
such
agency
and
at
such
a
risk
to
his
reputation
must
have
had
a
purpose
in
so
doing
which
could
only
be
explained
by
the
tragedy
which
took
place
in
his
home
so
soon
afterwards
this
point
reached
in
my
meditations
i
next
asked
myself
how
the
necessary
inquiries
could
be
started
without
risk
to
their
success
i
could
not
go
openly
to
mother
merry
or
rather
it
would
be
undesirable
for
me
to
do
so
if
as
i
sometimes
suspected
i
was
myself
under
surveillance
i
could
make
no
such
move
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
detectives
to
a
matter
which
i
hoped
to
keep
a
sacred
secret
between
hope
and
myself
remember
that
i
was
not
working
to
bring
the
guilty
to
justice
but
to
free
a
pure
heart
from
a
doubt
but
if
i
could
not
go
there
myself
whom
was
i
to
send
what
man
of
my
acquaintance
was
judicious
enough
to
be
entrusted
with
such
a
message
yox
i
did
not
like
the
man
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
very
shady
individual
and
shrank
with
strong
distaste
from
further
contact
with
him
underhill
i
laughed
at
the
suggestion
who
then
not
a
single
name
rose
in
my
mind
till
by
an
association
of
ideas
not
entirely
illogical
i
remembered
the
habits
of
certain
members
of
the
salvation
army
and
how
easy
it
would
be
for
one
of
them
to
enter
such
a
vile
haunt
as
mother
merry
and
interview
the
depraved
beings
to
be
found
there
without
attracting
the
notice
of
the
police
or
rousing
the
least
suspicion
as
to
their
intentions
but
could
i
reach
such
a
man
and
if
i
could
would
i
find
him
willing
to
undertake
such
an
errand
without
understanding
its
full
purport
and
just
what
use
was
to
be
made
of
the
knowledge
thus
obtained
this
seemed
very
doubtful
and
i
was
seriously
deliberating
over
my
next
move
when
my
mind
flew
straight
from
the
topic
engaging
it
to
that
memorable
moment
in
my
experience
when
amid
the
alarm
and
hurry
following
the
suspicions
expressed
by
the
physician
called
in
at
gillespie
death
the
glass
fell
from
hewson
hand
and
broke
into
a
hundred
pieces
on
the
hearth
the
tinkle
made
by
the
shattered
glass
the
gasp
which
escaped
the
old
man
lips
all
came
back
to
me
and
with
it
the
startling
conviction
strange
that
it
had
not
struck
me
before
that
this
old
and
tried
servant
of
a
disrupted
household
knew
who
had
tampered
with
that
glass
and
by
this
sudden
breaking
of
the
same
had
sought
to
shield
him
now
if
i
should
find
out
that
this
man
regarded
leighton
with
an
especial
fondness
but
such
thoughts
were
for
further
contemplation
with
a
resolution
born
perhaps
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
forced
my
mind
back
into
its
former
channel
and
resolutely
asked
myself
how
a
connection
was
to
be
established
between
mother
merry
and
myself
the
small
confidence
i
have
always
had
in
third
parties
especially
when
a
matter
of
delicate
inquiry
was
to
be
pushed
made
it
imperative
for
me
to
see
her
myself
yet
how
ah
an
idea
what
if
i
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
openly
requested
the
assistance
of
the
police
in
my
adventure
that
would
disarm
suspicion
and
render
me
independent
of
special
surveillance
the
idea
was
a
happy
one
and
relieved
by
the
prospect
it
offered
i
resigned
myself
to
sleep
next
day
i
went
boldly
to
police
headquarters
and
asked
for
assistance
in
making
some
inquiries
in
a
dangerous
quarter
of
the
town
i
said
that
the
case
then
before
me
necessitated
some
evidence
which
could
only
be
gathered
from
a
certain
old
woman
whose
name
and
place
of
living
i
had
yet
to
learn
by
judicious
questioning
in
that
quarter
of
the
city
where
she
had
been
last
seen
would
they
give
me
a
man
to
make
my
projected
tour
safe
they
would
could
i
have
him
now
i
could
satisfied
with
the
result
of
my
first
move
and
more
than
satisfied
with
the
unintelligent
appearance
of
the
man
they
picked
out
to
escort
me
i
made
for
mother
merry
but
not
in
a
direct
course
or
with
any
appearance
of
knowing
where
i
was
going
i
tried
several
and
chatted
across
several
bars
and
noting
the
indifference
with
which
my
companion
followed
me
i
really
began
to
cherish
hopes
of
coming
through
my
task
without
any
unpleasant
consequences
to
myself
sometimes
he
tried
to
help
me
but
as
i
had
given
no
names
and
confined
myself
to
a
somewhat
vague
description
of
the
person
i
wanted
this
help
was
naturally
futile
and
i
found
myself
approaching
my
goal
without
any
seeming
advance
having
been
made
should
i
proceed
at
once
to
the
docks
or
should
i
play
the
fox
game
a
little
longer
as
i
weighed
these
alternatives
my
eyes
fell
on
a
salvation
army
sign
and
the
idea
i
had
scouted
the
day
before
returned
to
me
with
renewed
force
pointing
to
the
windows
across
which
it
was
displayed
i
said
that
here
were
people
who
might
possibly
tell
me
where
to
find
the
woman
i
sought
and
leaving
the
officer
outside
he
seemed
quite
content
to
stay
in
the
fresh
air
i
went
in
and
respectfully
approached
the
woman
i
saw
before
me
i
am
come
for
assistance
i
began
i
am
in
search
of
a
woman
here
the
words
died
in
my
throat
opposite
me
and
quite
near
enough
for
me
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
i
saw
two
men
one
was
a
salvation
army
captain
and
the
other
was
leighton
gillespie
xx
the
little
house
in
new
jersey
the
surprise
was
great
but
i
doubt
if
i
betrayed
the
fact
to
the
unsuspicious
eye
of
the
patient
lass
who
attended
me
i
wish
to
see
one
of
your
captains
i
explained
i
will
gladly
await
his
convenience
captain
smith
will
be
at
liberty
soon
she
answered
going
back
to
her
work
i
was
thus
left
to
study
the
face
of
the
man
whom
at
that
very
moment
i
was
bent
upon
connecting
with
a
great
crime
i
had
not
seen
him
since
that
touching
scene
at
the
inquest
and
i
found
him
looking
both
older
and
sadder
perhaps
his
health
was
broken
perhaps
there
were
other
and
deeper
reasons
for
the
great
change
i
saw
in
him
i
had
instinctively
withdrawn
a
few
steps
when
the
lass
left
me
and
stood
in
as
inconspicuous
a
position
as
possible
with
my
face
turned
from
the
light
but
i
had
not
retreated
far
enough
to
lose
a
word
of
the
conversation
going
on
so
near
me
they
were
discussing
an
approaching
meeting
leighton
with
deep
interest
the
captain
with
an
embarrassment
not
often
seen
in
one
of
his
calling
listening
i
heard
these
words
it
will
be
a
full
one
wo
it
this
from
leighton
it
usually
is
on
a
day
like
this
was
the
hesitating
reply
do
women
come
more
women
than
men
i
should
like
to
speak
at
the
meeting
the
captain
with
an
uncomfortable
flush
fumbled
with
the
ribbon
on
his
cap
and
said
nothing
leighton
repeated
his
request
the
captain
summoned
up
courage
i
am
sorry
sir
he
remarked
in
an
apologetic
tone
you
have
given
the
army
much
help
and
we
have
listened
to
many
good
words
from
you
but
i
have
received
orders
not
to
let
you
speak
again
that
is
from
the
platform
a
painful
silence
ensued
then
leighton
remarked
with
a
forced
composure
and
something
more
than
his
usual
melancholy
because
of
the
unhappy
prominence
given
me
by
the
circumstances
attending
my
father
death
that
and
something
else
i
may
as
well
be
frank
sir
we
have
heard
of
the
little
house
leased
under
your
name
in
new
jersey
ah
a
chord
had
been
touched
which
vibrated
keenly
in
this
mysterious
breast
i
saw
his
hand
go
to
his
throat
and
fall
again
quickly
meantime
the
captain
went
on
we
are
not
frightened
by
sin
and
we
hold
out
our
hands
to
sinners
but
we
have
no
use
for
a
man
who
prays
in
new
york
and
has
his
pleasure
on
the
other
side
of
the
north
river
it
shows
hypocrisy
sir
and
hypocrisy
is
the
enemy
of
religion
a
smile
whose
dark
depths
betrayed
anything
but
hypocrisy
at
that
moment
crossed
leighton
pale
lips
as
he
remarked
without
anger
which
i
could
not
but
consider
strange
in
a
man
so
openly
attacked
that
little
house
is
empty
now
has
the
thought
struck
you
that
my
heart
might
be
so
too
the
captain
who
evidently
did
not
like
his
task
seemed
to
experience
some
difficulty
in
answering
but
when
he
had
settled
upon
his
reply
spoke
both
clearly
and
with
resolution
the
house
of
which
you
speak
may
lack
its
occupant
just
now
but
everything
goes
to
show
she
is
always
expected
or
why
are
the
lamps
invariably
lighted
there
at
nightfall
the
rooms
kept
warm
and
the
larder
replenished
some
birds
in
flitting
come
round
again
to
their
forsaken
nest
your
bird
may
meanwhile
the
nest
remains
ready
enough
the
tone
was
sharp
now
the
words
cutting
you
do
not
understand
me
nor
my
interest
in
the
poor
and
forsaken
as
for
my
place
among
you
let
it
be
filled
by
whom
you
will
i
have
my
own
griefs
and
they
are
not
light
and
i
have
anxieties
such
as
visit
few
men
a
ban
is
upon
me
and
upon
all
who
bear
the
name
of
gillespie
this
is
known
to
you
and
possibly
to
every
man
and
woman
soon
to
assemble
here
perhaps
you
do
well
not
to
submit
me
to
their
curiosity
but
there
is
something
you
do
for
me
something
which
you
will
do
for
me
i
am
sure
something
which
would
place
me
under
lasting
obligation
to
you
without
doing
you
or
anyone
else
the
least
harm
in
the
world
a
woman
may
come
in
here
a
woman
unkempt
but
with
a
look
i
am
sure
you
will
know
her
there
is
an
unearthly
loveliness
in
her
wan
features
she
has
but
what
use
is
there
in
my
attempting
to
describe
her
if
she
answers
to
the
name
of
some
persons
call
her
millie
she
is
the
woman
i
seek
will
you
give
her
this
he
had
torn
the
edge
off
a
newspaper
lying
near
and
was
rapidly
writing
on
it
a
few
words
it
will
do
no
harm
to
the
cause
for
which
you
are
working
and
it
may
save
a
most
unhappy
woman
of
myself
i
make
no
count
yet
it
might
save
me
too
he
handed
over
to
the
captain
the
slip
carelessly
folded
it
was
received
with
reluctance
gillespie
noting
this
observed
with
some
agitation
you
are
here
to
do
god
work
sometimes
you
are
called
upon
to
do
it
blindly
and
without
full
enlightenment
and
having
emphasised
this
with
a
bow
of
remarkable
dignity
he
went
out
little
realising
that
the
possible
clue
to
his
own
future
fate
lay
in
the
hands
of
one
he
at
that
moment
passed
without
a
look
these
are
the
crosses
we
are
called
upon
to
bear
spoke
up
the
salvation
army
captain
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
man
they
had
once
held
in
deepest
reverence
now
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
he
added
turning
over
in
his
hands
the
slip
which
had
just
been
given
into
his
charge
involuntarily
my
hand
went
out
to
it
it
was
a
perfectly
unconscious
action
on
my
part
and
i
blushed
vividly
when
i
realised
what
i
had
done
i
had
no
authority
here
i
was
not
even
known
to
the
good
man
and
woman
before
me
the
captain
who
may
or
may
not
have
noted
my
anxiety
paid
no
heed
either
to
my
unfortunate
or
to
the
apologetic
question
with
which
i
endeavoured
to
retrieve
myself
turning
to
the
lass
beside
him
he
handed
her
the
slip
with
the
look
which
a
man
gives
to
a
woman
on
whose
good
sense
and
judgment
he
has
come
to
rely
take
it
sally
he
said
you
will
know
the
girl
if
she
comes
in
and
what
more
you
know
how
to
manage
the
matter
so
as
to
give
satisfaction
to
all
the
parties
concerned
and
now
sir
he
inquired
turning
towards
me
but
at
this
instant
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
arrival
of
detective
sweetwater
a
man
for
whose
presence
i
was
certainly
little
prepared
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
passed
you
something
he
cried
approaching
the
lass
without
ceremony
though
not
without
respect
me
he
did
not
appear
to
see
the
gentleman
left
a
note
with
us
for
one
of
the
poor
women
who
sometimes
straggle
in
here
was
her
quiet
response
he
is
interested
in
poor
girls
tries
to
reclaim
them
i
am
sorry
protested
the
detective
but
i
must
have
a
glance
at
what
he
wrote
it
may
be
of
immediate
importance
to
the
police
here
is
my
authority
he
added
in
lower
tones
opening
his
coat
for
a
moment
you
know
under
what
suspicion
the
gillespie
family
lies
he
is
a
gillespie
let
me
see
those
lines
or
stay
read
them
out
yourself
that
may
be
better
the
young
woman
hesitated
consulted
the
captain
with
a
look
then
glanced
down
at
the
slip
trembling
in
her
hand
it
was
half
unrolled
and
some
of
its
words
must
have
met
her
eye
why
do
you
think
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
serious
matter
you
mention
she
ventured
to
ask
the
detective
approached
his
mouth
to
her
ear
but
my
hearing
did
not
fail
me
even
under
these
unfavourable
circumstances
everything
has
connection
with
it
i
heard
him
say
everything
they
do
and
think
i
would
trust
one
of
them
round
the
corner
i
should
make
the
greatest
mistake
of
my
life
if
i
allowed
any
secret
communication
written
by
a
gillespie
to
pass
under
my
nose
without
an
attempt
to
see
what
it
was
this
one
may
be
of
an
innocent
nature
probably
is
the
gentleman
who
left
it
with
you
passes
for
a
philanthropist
and
as
such
might
very
readily
hold
communication
with
the
worst
characters
in
town
without
any
other
motive
than
the
one
you
yourselves
can
best
appreciate
but
i
must
be
sure
of
this
i
have
been
detailed
to
watch
his
movements
and
his
movements
have
brought
him
here
you
will
therefore
oblige
me
miss
if
you
can
make
it
clear
that
the
cause
of
justice
by
which
i
mean
the
cause
which
i
here
personally
represent
will
not
suffer
injury
by
the
free
transmission
of
this
slip
to
the
person
for
whom
it
is
meant
i
will
read
you
what
he
has
written
here
replied
the
girl
he
left
it
open
or
almost
open
to
anyone
perusal
and
i
heard
her
read
out
in
low
but
penetrating
tones
the
following
words
when
i
last
saw
you
you
were
suffering
this
is
an
unbearable
thought
to
me
yet
i
can
not
go
to
you
for
reasons
which
you
can
readily
appreciate
come
to
me
then
the
house
is
always
open
and
the
servants
have
received
orders
to
admit
anyone
who
asks
for
me
this
was
certainly
warm
language
from
a
mere
philanthropist
to
a
city
waif
whose
misery
had
attracted
his
notice
but
no
remarks
passed
and
sweetwater
did
not
seek
to
hinder
even
by
a
look
the
careful
refolding
of
the
slip
and
the
putting
of
it
away
in
the
young
lass
desk
indeed
he
seemed
to
approve
of
this
for
the
next
moment
i
heard
him
say
that
right
take
good
care
of
the
slip
if
the
young
woman
comes
in
give
it
to
her
i
suppose
you
know
her
not
at
all
he
simply
described
her
to
us
or
attempted
to
she
may
not
come
in
at
all
then
keep
a
grip
on
those
lines
what
kind
of
a
person
did
he
say
she
was
oh
i
do
know
he
said
she
was
but
beautiful
and
that
she
answered
to
some
such
name
as
millie
it
likely
to
be
a
fake
the
whole
mess
captain
miss
and
detective
sweetwater
stepped
away
i
had
thought
him
keen
yet
he
had
paid
no
more
attention
to
me
than
if
i
had
been
a
stick
was
the
corner
in
which
i
sat
darker
than
i
thought
or
had
he
been
so
full
of
his
own
affairs
that
he
failed
to
recognise
me
i
had
kept
my
face
turned
away
but
he
assuredly
must
have
known
my
figure
when
he
was
gone
the
two
laid
their
heads
together
for
a
moment
then
began
to
bustle
towards
me
in
the
meantime
i
had
planned
a
i
had
considered
if
by
a
little
acting
on
my
part
i
could
put
them
in
the
wrong
i
might
succeed
in
getting
from
them
some
positive
facts
to
work
upon
accordingly
i
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
feeling
when
the
captain
found
himself
face
to
face
with
me
i
heard
you
said
i
flinging
down
the
book
i
had
taken
up
i
have
ears
like
a
hare
and
i
could
help
it
i
know
gillespie
and
it
made
my
blood
boil
to
hear
him
addressed
with
suspicion
how
anyone
who
has
ever
heard
him
speak
to
the
poor
and
unfortunate
could
associate
him
with
the
atrocious
death
of
his
father
i
can
not
imagine
so
good
to
poor
girls
so
bountiful
in
his
charities
i
thought
you
were
christians
here
the
captain
may
have
been
a
christian
but
he
was
also
a
man
and
being
a
man
looked
nettled
it
was
a
mistake
for
us
to
discuss
army
affairs
within
reach
of
two
such
sharp
ears
said
he
gillespie
has
done
some
good
work
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
add
myself
to
those
who
have
associated
his
name
with
the
crime
which
has
just
made
the
family
notorious
i
simply
fail
to
stand
by
him
because
he
uses
us
as
a
cloak
for
his
personal
indulgences
he
is
infatuated
with
a
woman
whom
he
has
never
presumed
to
present
to
his
family
this
wo
do
for
us
the
other
matter
belongs
to
the
police
i
allowed
myself
to
cool
down
a
trifle
i
beg
your
pardon
you
know
your
own
business
of
course
but
it
a
little
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
such
a
refined
man
as
gillespie
could
find
any
other
than
a
charitable
interest
in
any
woman
likely
to
come
straying
in
here
did
you
ever
see
his
home
his
child
his
friends
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
curtly
replied
i
can
imagine
then
in
a
tone
calculated
to
end
the
interview
so
far
as
this
topic
was
concerned
we
count
nothing
as
strange
in
this
place
sir
we
come
too
near
the
unregenerate
heart
human
the
same
sir
in
rich
and
in
poor
and
now
sir
your
business
most
time
for
our
noon
meeting
so
i
must
ask
you
to
be
concise
i
had
almost
forgotten
i
had
any
business
there
but
i
pulled
myself
up
under
his
eye
and
told
him
i
was
on
the
search
for
a
woman
too
but
she
an
old
one
i
made
haste
to
assure
him
a
keeper
who
is
in
the
possession
of
evidence
of
great
importance
to
a
client
of
mine
her
name
as
told
me
is
mother
merry
do
you
know
any
such
person
he
did
not
but
informed
me
that
there
were
several
queer
old
places
down
by
the
wharves
where
i
might
hear
of
her
this
was
enough
i
had
now
an
excuse
for
penetrating
the
district
towards
which
i
had
been
pointing
from
the
first
thanking
him
and
asking
his
pardon
for
my
few
brusque
words
i
went
out
and
giving
my
policeman
a
wink
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
river
xxi
the
complications
which
had
surrounded
leighton
gillespie
were
through
his
own
imprudence
in
the
way
of
being
cleared
up
though
hardly
to
his
advantage
this
was
not
all
either
from
indifference
or
ignorance
i
hardly
thought
it
was
indifference
he
had
not
only
called
attention
to
his
own
secret
passion
but
laid
such
a
trap
for
the
object
of
it
that
she
could
hardly
fail
to
fall
ultimately
into
the
hands
of
the
police
under
these
circumstances
was
it
my
duty
to
proceed
with
the
task
i
had
imposed
upon
myself
was
my
help
needed
when
man
was
at
work
it
would
not
seem
so
but
as
i
was
happy
enough
to
remember
before
my
hesitation
resolved
itself
into
action
the
one
clue
connecting
him
to
this
murder
was
to
be
found
in
my
hands
not
theirs
i
alone
knew
where
to
look
for
the
woman
who
had
procured
him
the
phial
of
poison
this
in
itself
created
an
obligation
i
dared
not
slight
i
must
continue
my
quest
if
i
desired
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
hope
meredith
the
day
was
friday
and
the
were
doing
a
lively
business
by
the
time
i
had
threaded
my
way
through
innumerable
sheds
i
had
got
enough
of
this
commodity
into
my
nostrils
to
satisfy
my
appetite
for
a
week
i
was
glad
when
i
stepped
out
upon
the
wharf
is
it
along
there
you
want
to
go
asked
the
officer
under
whose
protection
i
moved
i
looked
and
saw
fluttering
before
me
the
calico
curtain
which
had
blown
in
and
out
of
yox
story
yes
if
it
where
an
old
woman
named
merry
is
to
be
found
i
ask
he
approached
a
brother
officer
whose
presence
i
had
not
noticed
spoke
to
him
and
came
back
that
the
place
said
he
do
you
want
me
to
go
in
with
you
not
if
it
safe
oh
it
safe
enough
at
this
hour
you
have
any
too
much
cash
on
you
i
judge
besides
i
hang
about
the
door
and
if
you
do
come
out
in
ten
minutes
i
just
inquire
the
reason
why
you
see
the
place
on
our
books
and
we
do
want
to
keep
too
open
an
eye
on
it
i
was
glad
to
be
allowed
to
go
in
alone
i
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
this
and
felt
correspondingly
relieved
an
unexpectedly
quiet
interior
met
my
eye
the
bare
walls
the
busy
stove
the
woman
whose
gaunt
frame
and
lowering
eye
i
had
heard
described
by
yox
were
before
me
but
nothing
of
a
sinister
or
even
suspicious
appearance
i
had
surprised
mother
merry
quarters
at
a
happy
hour
that
is
happy
for
her
and
possibly
so
for
me
but
perhaps
i
convey
a
wrong
impression
in
speaking
of
the
walls
as
bare
they
were
not
so
for
stretched
from
side
to
side
of
the
stifling
room
were
lines
on
which
coarse
garments
were
hanging
up
to
dry
and
on
the
wall
directly
before
me
i
saw
a
pair
of
rough
seaman
breeches
pinned
up
in
a
ghostly
and
grotesque
fashion
over
the
little
stove
which
even
on
this
mild
afternoon
was
doing
its
best
to
keep
out
undesirable
visitors
the
old
woman
who
was
bending
over
a
table
on
which
a
few
broken
victuals
lay
was
without
doubt
mother
merry
herself
and
recognizing
her
as
such
i
assumed
the
manner
i
thought
best
calculated
to
impress
her
with
a
broad
smile
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
pocket
then
as
i
perceived
her
hard
eye
melt
and
the
coarse
lines
about
her
mouth
twist
into
something
which
was
as
near
encouragement
as
one
could
expect
from
a
being
always
on
her
guard
against
strangers
i
whispered
with
a
careful
look
about
me
anyone
here
my
errand
wo
stand
peering
eyes
or
listening
ears
she
gave
me
a
penetrating
glance
what
do
you
want
she
grumbled
i
took
out
a
dollar
and
laid
it
on
the
table
her
hand
was
over
it
in
an
instant
a
morsel
of
drug
i
whispered
three
drops
of
something
that
do
up
a
man
in
five
minutes
the
man
is
myself
i
added
as
her
eye
darkened
she
continued
to
regard
me
intently
for
a
minute
then
cast
a
quick
glance
down
at
the
hand
which
covered
the
coin
sorry
she
muttered
with
a
reluctant
lift
of
that
member
but
not
in
the
way
of
getting
any
such
stuff
who
sent
you
to
me
i
hesitated
then
made
my
great
venture
the
man
you
helped
out
of
here
the
night
the
police
came
down
on
you
he
had
better
luck
than
i
you
did
refuse
it
to
him
you
lie
she
cried
startled
by
these
uncompromising
words
i
fell
back
had
i
made
a
great
mistake
he
never
got
any
such
stuff
from
me
she
went
on
shrilly
that
was
what
he
came
for
or
else
he
made
more
of
a
fool
of
me
than
i
knew
what
did
he
come
for
her
look
of
inquiry
turned
into
one
of
suspicion
did
you
come
here
to
ask
that
if
so
you
better
go
i
not
one
of
the
blabbing
sort
i
drew
out
another
dollar
perhaps
he
got
it
upstairs
i
insinuated
oh
she
cried
spreading
out
her
long
fingers
so
as
to
cover
both
pieces
that
may
be
those
girls
have
strange
ways
with
them
may
i
have
a
peep
at
them
may
i
have
a
peep
at
the
emphasis
i
placed
on
the
last
word
called
out
from
mother
merry
a
long
stare
which
i
bore
as
best
i
could
she
has
a
drop
left
of
what
you
were
talking
about
said
mother
merry
at
last
if
she
gave
it
to
him
it
all
gone
perhaps
she
can
get
more
where
she
got
that
i
made
bold
to
suggest
the
old
hag
gave
a
grunt
and
looked
gloatingly
at
the
coins
sparkling
between
her
bony
fingers
how
many
of
these
have
you
saved
up
she
asked
ten
and
with
ten
dollars
in
your
pocket
you
come
here
for
her
amazement
was
quite
real
ten
dollars
in
my
pocket
and
wanting
poison
it
took
her
some
minutes
to
grasp
the
fact
then
she
said
and
how
many
of
these
are
for
five
she
pawed
at
the
coins
till
they
were
well
under
her
palm
i
call
her
down
will
that
do
yes
she
may
not
be
just
right
no
matter
she
may
be
all
right
herself
and
not
think
you
so
i
risk
that
too
then
stand
near
the
stove
so
she
wo
see
you
when
she
first
comes
in
she
would
stay
a
minute
if
she
did
obeying
the
old
hag
i
watched
her
sidle
to
the
door
already
familiar
to
me
in
yox
narrative
the
door
upstairs
i
mean
as
she
disappeared
behind
it
i
glanced
at
the
table
near
which
she
had
been
standing
the
two
silver
dollars
were
gone
i
never
see
them
again
was
my
inward
decision
and
i
never
did
the
presence
of
the
wet
clothing
hanging
so
near
me
was
anything
but
agreeable
moving
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
stove
i
at
least
avoided
some
of
the
fumes
which
in
that
stifling
atmosphere
were
almost
insufferable
but
i
was
more
exposed
to
view
something
which
the
old
woman
noticed
when
she
reëntered
you
have
moved
she
suspiciously
snarled
come
back
and
let
the
clothes
hide
you
perhaps
i
can
make
the
girl
sing
if
she
do
see
you
she
seems
to
be
in
one
of
her
queer
moods
would
you
like
to
hear
her
sing
as
the
old
woman
evidently
expected
an
enthusiastic
assent
i
gave
it
with
as
much
force
as
i
could
muster
up
on
such
short
notice
hush
she
is
coming
you
must
mind
her
laugh
it
was
well
she
gave
me
this
warning
for
the
sudden
wild
shout
of
hilarious
mirth
which
i
now
heard
from
the
region
of
the
staircase
was
so
startling
that
without
these
words
of
caution
i
might
have
betrayed
myself
as
it
was
i
kept
my
post
in
silence
watching
for
the
girl
who
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
had
given
the
bottle
of
prussic
acid
to
leighton
gillespie
would
she
prove
to
be
the
wild
unkempt
woman
whose
beautiful
look
he
had
endeavoured
to
describe
to
the
salvation
army
captain
i
hoped
not
why
i
hardly
knew
suddenly
there
broke
upon
my
eyes
a
sight
i
have
never
forgotten
a
woman
came
in
a
woman
not
a
girl
and
while
her
look
was
not
beautiful
far
from
it
she
had
that
about
her
which
no
man
could
see
for
the
first
time
without
emotion
her
features
were
ordinary
when
taken
by
themselves
but
seen
together
possessed
an
individuality
whose
subtle
attraction
had
been
marred
but
not
entirely
destroyed
by
the
countless
privations
she
had
evidently
undergone
and
her
hair
wild
and
though
it
was
was
wonderful
so
was
the
air
of
vivacity
and
rich
exuberant
life
which
characterised
her
though
her
cheek
was
pale
and
her
arms
thin
she
fairly
beamed
with
that
indefinable
but
spontaneous
gladness
which
springs
from
the
mere
fact
of
being
alive
a
gladness
which
at
that
moment
did
not
suggest
drugs
or
any
unwholesome
source
i
was
astounded
at
the
effect
she
produced
upon
me
and
watched
her
eagerly
no
common
unfortunate
this
yet
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
among
the
city
worst
a
woman
more
bedraggled
or
more
poorly
nourished
sing
cried
old
mother
merry
with
an
authority
against
which
i
instinctively
rebelled
though
i
had
seen
the
object
of
it
for
only
a
couple
of
minutes
you
feel
like
it
and
i
feel
like
hearing
you
sing
the
woman
throat
throbbed
she
stopped
just
where
she
was
and
threw
out
her
arms
then
she
smiled
and
then
she
sang
i
have
heard
guilbert
i
have
heard
loftus
but
neither
of
them
ever
made
my
temples
throb
my
heart
swell
or
my
breath
falter
as
this
woman
did
that
she
chose
the
saddest
of
all
sad
songs
she
who
a
moment
before
seemed
hardly
able
to
contain
her
laughter
could
not
quite
account
for
this
effect
nor
the
fact
that
these
flights
of
tragic
melody
rose
from
out
a
misery
which
no
laughter
could
cover
up
it
was
genius
great
and
wonderful
genius
misdirected
and
lost
but
still
and
worthy
of
an
artist
recognition
as
she
sang
on
i
yielded
her
mine
for
my
heart
swelled
almost
to
bursting
and
when
she
had
finished
and
stood
poised
rapt
ecstatic
enthralled
with
her
own
melody
and
beautiful
with
her
own
feeling
i
found
my
cheeks
wet
with
tears
i
had
never
wept
at
anyone
singing
before
dance
came
in
fresh
command
from
the
miserable
hag
behind
me
i
had
forgotten
mother
merry
but
the
raised
face
i
was
contemplating
drooped
forward
at
these
words
and
the
arms
which
had
moved
all
through
the
singing
fell
inert
i
have
no
strength
she
wailed
yet
in
another
instant
she
was
swaying
turning
rising
and
falling
in
mazes
of
movement
so
full
of
grace
and
charm
that
i
scarcely
missed
the
music
which
should
have
accompanied
them
it
was
more
than
a
dance
it
was
a
drama
instinctively
i
followed
her
feelings
and
knew
as
by
a
species
of
revelation
what
each
motion
was
meant
to
convey
i
watched
her
as
i
would
some
charmed
being
for
the
marks
of
care
had
vanished
from
her
features
and
the
lips
which
had
been
drawn
and
white
burned
redly
and
the
hair
which
had
hung
in
dishevelled
locks
now
blew
out
in
live
curls
athrill
with
passion
and
breathing
forth
rapture
and
love
suddenly
she
paused
mother
merry
had
pointed
me
out
with
the
words
the
gentleman
is
looking
at
you
instantly
her
beauty
shrivelled
and
vanished
her
hands
went
up
to
her
face
and
she
crouched
like
a
lost
thing
against
the
floor
no
no
she
wailed
and
would
have
fled
but
mother
merry
forced
her
back
the
gentleman
wants
something
he
wants
a
drop
of
what
you
gave
the
other
one
that
night
you
remember
the
night
the
boys
slid
away
and
left
us
to
the
police
instinctively
her
right
hand
went
to
her
bosom
and
her
eyes
looked
wildly
into
mine
suddenly
she
saw
the
moisture
on
my
cheeks
oh
he
been
crying
mother
merry
been
crying
perhaps
now
i
can
cry
too
i
should
like
to
it
better
than
singing
and
she
broke
into
sobs
so
violent
that
i
stood
aghast
in
mingled
pity
and
amazement
just
then
the
policeman
looked
in
how
now
he
cried
what
up
my
impulse
was
to
shield
her
from
this
fellow
curiosity
motioning
him
away
i
whispered
in
her
ear
you
have
said
whether
you
would
give
me
what
i
have
come
for
what
is
that
a
drop
of
what
kills
trouble
kills
it
at
once
instantly
and
forever
i
am
wretched
heartbroken
god
knows
i
spoke
the
truth
she
stared
and
what
remained
of
light
in
her
face
went
out
i
have
none
now
she
hoarsely
assured
me
then
get
it
where
you
got
that
i
can
not
i
got
that
when
it
was
easier
to
smile
and
dancing
was
not
followed
by
dreadful
pain
now
she
tried
to
laugh
as
she
had
a
few
moments
before
but
her
jocund
mood
had
passed
one
would
never
imagine
from
her
present
aspect
that
she
had
just
floated
through
the
room
an
embodiment
of
joyousness
and
grace
you
gave
it
all
to
him
i
questioned
the
emphasis
did
not
strike
her
or
rather
it
assumed
a
different
place
in
her
mind
than
on
my
lips
to
him
she
repeated
shrinking
back
with
evident
distrust
yes
i
pursued
following
her
and
speaking
in
her
ear
the
sailor
lad
who
took
it
away
from
here
that
night
poison
prussic
acid
a
phial
you
could
hide
in
your
hand
she
broke
into
laughter
not
the
expression
of
joy
but
that
of
defiance
if
not
derision
she
was
but
a
common
woman
now
sailor
lad
she
repeated
and
laughed
again
i
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
speaking
the
significant
word
looking
around
and
seeing
that
mother
merry
was
not
too
near
i
whispered
a
sailor
lad
with
a
gentleman
name
you
know
the
name
so
do
i
leighton
gillespie
she
had
not
expected
me
to
go
so
far
smothering
a
frightened
cry
she
struck
her
hands
together
over
her
head
and
dashed
towards
the
door
by
which
she
had
come
in
mother
merry
stood
before
it
laughing
then
she
turned
to
escape
by
the
street
but
there
she
was
confronted
by
the
heavy
form
of
the
policeman
who
had
thrust
himself
across
the
threshold
crouching
she
folded
her
arms
over
her
breast
and
made
a
plunge
for
the
door
communicating
with
the
den
beyond
it
opened
under
her
pressure
and
she
fell
gasping
and
bruised
upon
the
threshold
i
hastened
to
her
aid
but
she
was
up
before
i
could
reach
her
i
do
know
the
man
you
talk
of
i
do
know
you
i
am
a
free
woman
a
free
woman
she
shrieked
bounding
to
the
trap
and
opening
it
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
she
swung
herself
down
i
tried
to
stop
her
but
she
was
as
agile
as
a
cat
as
i
leaned
over
the
hole
i
saw
her
disappearing
among
a
confusion
of
oozy
piles
and
shuddering
with
the
chill
of
the
mephitic
air
that
came
pouring
up
i
drew
back
that
the
end
of
her
for
muttered
the
harsh
voice
of
mother
merry
behind
me
when
she
like
that
you
might
as
well
make
for
other
quarters
but
you
had
your
money
worth
you
heard
her
sing
you
seen
her
dance
it
not
every
man
can
boast
of
that
she
shy
of
men
at
least
she
never
sing
for
them
perhaps
i
looked
surprised
perhaps
i
only
looked
dejected
misinterpreting
the
expression
whichever
it
was
old
mother
merry
sidled
up
closer
and
as
i
made
for
the
door
whispered
with
a
leer
if
you
really
want
what
you
say
come
back
in
a
week
and
if
i
can
get
it
you
shall
have
it
i
gave
her
another
coin
what
do
you
call
that
girl
i
asked
with
my
hand
on
the
latch
the
money
made
her
loquacious
millie
she
answered
that
is
not
how
she
speaks
it
but
it
how
we
all
call
her
it
was
then
as
i
had
thought
i
had
seen
and
listened
to
the
woman
to
whom
leighton
gillespie
had
addressed
those
appealing
lines
xxii
a
disagreeable
hour
with
a
disagreeable
man
this
interview
made
an
astonishing
impression
upon
me
never
had
i
supposed
myself
capable
of
being
stirred
to
such
sympathy
by
a
being
so
degraded
as
this
wonderful
was
it
the
contrast
between
her
genius
and
the
conditions
under
which
that
genius
had
shown
itself
possibly
or
was
it
that
a
recognition
of
the
latent
sweetness
underlying
her
wild
nature
had
caused
a
feeling
of
rebellion
against
the
degradation
into
which
a
creature
of
such
amazing
possibilities
had
fallen
whatever
it
was
i
was
conscious
of
a
haunting
sense
of
regret
such
as
had
followed
few
experiences
in
my
life
and
began
to
look
upon
the
man
who
could
make
use
of
such
a
ruin
of
womanhood
for
the
obtaining
of
a
deadly
drug
with
something
deeper
and
more
active
than
mere
distrust
leighton
gillespie
was
a
man
of
the
world
he
knew
this
wretched
creature
weak
points
and
what
would
procure
him
the
poison
he
dared
not
buy
from
any
druggist
or
chemist
anyone
who
saw
this
woman
could
read
her
story
gay
as
she
was
buoyant
as
her
spirit
rose
in
certain
moments
of
ecstatic
passion
she
had
corresponding
moods
of
morbid
depression
possibly
of
actual
suffering
which
only
morphine
could
relieve
he
knew
this
and
used
his
knowledge
without
let
or
scruple
was
he
a
monster
of
selfishness
or
only
another
instance
of
a
good
man
gone
to
the
bad
for
the
love
of
a
worthless
woman
the
latter
theory
seemed
the
more
probable
since
all
good
instincts
could
not
be
lacking
in
a
man
who
had
been
confessedly
helpful
in
many
ways
towards
rescuing
the
needy
and
aiding
the
unhappy
undone
by
a
woman
was
that
the
situation
it
is
a
common
one
god
knows
yet
i
found
it
hard
to
allot
her
the
place
suggested
by
this
theory
she
did
not
look
like
one
capable
of
inclining
a
man
to
murder
yet
might
i
not
be
playing
the
fool
in
cherishing
so
generous
an
estimate
of
her
might
i
not
be
as
yet
too
much
under
the
spell
of
her
peculiar
grace
to
rightly
judge
the
nature
underlying
it
what
did
i
know
of
him
or
of
her
that
i
should
burden
him
with
all
the
blame
and
in
what
did
my
own
wild
uncalculating
passion
for
a
woman
who
not
only
did
not
love
me
but
of
whose
real
character
i
knew
little
save
as
it
shone
for
me
through
her
captivating
face
differ
from
the
feeling
which
might
easily
be
awakened
in
a
still
more
ardent
breast
by
a
creature
of
so
much
grace
and
fire
certainly
the
words
i
had
overheard
leighton
gillespie
use
in
his
colloquy
with
the
salvation
army
captain
showed
the
existence
of
feelings
far
beyond
those
usually
associated
with
a
commonplace
passion
so
did
the
lines
he
had
left
behind
him
for
this
waif
but
if
it
was
love
which
moved
him
it
was
a
love
which
did
not
shrink
from
involving
its
object
in
crime
this
she
had
herself
recognised
else
why
had
she
shown
such
terror
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
made
such
a
hazardous
attempt
at
escape
when
threatened
by
the
prospect
of
further
association
with
him
the
progress
which
i
had
made
in
the
case
i
had
undertaken
against
this
man
may
seem
to
have
reached
a
point
justifying
me
in
communicating
the
result
to
hope
but
though
i
had
succeeded
in
supplying
one
of
the
missing
links
heretofore
mentioned
as
necessary
to
that
end
i
nevertheless
hesitated
to
approach
her
till
the
whole
chain
was
complete
her
very
desire
to
believe
her
youngest
cousin
innocent
would
make
her
slow
in
accepting
conclusions
too
much
in
the
line
of
her
own
wishes
she
might
even
now
be
moved
by
secret
hopes
in
this
direction
might
cherish
convictions
and
calm
herself
with
soothing
anticipations
of
restored
confidence
in
alfred
but
she
would
require
the
most
positive
evidence
that
the
potion
however
and
by
whomever
obtained
had
been
actually
and
knowingly
administered
by
leighton
to
the
establishment
of
this
last
link
in
the
chain
i
must
therefore
address
myself
an
almost
hopeless
task
from
which
i
shrank
with
very
natural
misgivings
two
paths
of
inquiry
and
two
only
offered
any
promise
of
success
one
of
these
struck
me
as
practicable
the
other
not
but
the
practicable
one
was
not
within
my
reach
while
the
other
was
little
more
than
a
dream
i
allude
in
the
first
instance
to
the
knowledge
supposed
to
lie
hidden
within
the
breast
of
the
old
butler
while
the
dream
well
the
dream
was
this
for
some
time
i
had
suspected
the
existence
of
a
secret
and
as
yet
unknown
witness
of
this
crime
a
witness
for
whose
appearance
on
the
scene
i
had
daily
looked
and
from
whom
i
did
not
yet
despair
of
gleaning
valuable
testimony
what
basis
had
i
for
this
dream
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
in
presenting
to
your
notice
a
diagram
of
the
parlour
floor
of
the
gillespie
house
i
was
careful
to
show
the
window
to
be
found
at
the
left
of
gillespie
desk
but
i
drew
no
attention
to
this
window
nor
did
i
think
it
worth
my
while
to
say
that
i
found
the
shade
of
this
window
rolled
up
when
i
first
followed
claire
into
the
room
later
i
drew
this
shade
down
but
not
before
noticing
that
a
window
stood
open
in
the
extension
running
back
of
the
gillespie
yard
from
the
adjoining
house
on
street
and
that
in
the
room
thus
disclosed
a
man
was
to
be
seen
moving
uneasily
about
now
if
this
man
had
been
in
that
room
for
any
length
of
time
the
chances
were
that
his
glances
had
fallen
more
than
once
on
the
brilliantly
lighted
interior
of
gillespie
den
lying
as
it
did
directly
under
his
eye
if
so
how
much
or
how
little
had
he
seen
of
what
went
on
there
that
is
what
i
now
proposed
to
find
out
that
this
person
who
was
a
total
stranger
to
me
had
given
no
sign
of
being
in
the
possession
of
facts
withheld
from
the
police
did
not
deter
me
from
hoping
that
i
should
yet
learn
something
from
him
many
men
among
them
myself
have
an
invincible
dislike
to
the
publicity
inseparable
from
the
position
of
witness
and
if
this
unknown
man
imagined
as
he
naturally
might
that
the
police
were
ignorant
of
the
opportunity
which
had
been
given
him
of
looking
into
house
at
a
moment
so
critical
the
chances
were
that
he
would
keep
silent
in
regard
to
it
that
his
appearance
at
the
window
had
been
simultaneous
with
my
sight
of
him
and
thus
too
late
for
him
to
have
seen
more
than
i
did
of
what
went
on
in
gillespie
den
was
a
possibility
which
would
occur
to
any
man
also
that
he
might
have
been
there
and
in
full
sight
of
the
window
from
the
first
yet
had
distractions
of
his
own
which
kept
him
from
making
use
of
his
opportunities
nevertheless
the
probabilities
were
favourable
to
the
hope
i
had
conceived
and
deciding
that
in
my
present
uncertainty
any
action
was
better
than
none
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ascertain
who
this
young
man
was
and
whether
any
means
offered
for
my
making
his
acquaintance
sam
underhill
was
the
only
man
i
knew
capable
of
bringing
this
about
i
therefore
went
below
in
search
of
him
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
come
upon
him
just
as
he
was
returning
to
his
room
for
some
theatre
tickets
he
had
forgotten
to
put
into
his
pocket
i
attacked
him
before
he
could
back
out
what
is
the
name
of
those
people
who
live
in
the
first
house
west
from
fifth
avenue
on
street
i
asked
do
you
remember
the
house
i
mean
that
very
narrow
front
with
a
vase
of
artificial
flowers
in
one
of
the
parlour
windows
me
if
i
know
he
protested
in
a
high
state
of
impatience
as
he
snatched
up
the
tickets
he
was
looking
for
then
seeing
that
i
was
in
no
condition
to
be
fooled
with
he
admitted
that
the
name
was
rosenthal
and
carelessly
added
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
oh
i
see
you
are
still
on
the
scent
still
harping
on
that
gillespie
poisoning
case
well
the
rosenthals
may
live
near
the
people
just
mentioned
but
there
nothing
in
that
for
you
or
anyone
else
interested
in
this
crime
why
because
they
move
in
a
totally
different
set
from
the
gillespies
they
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
them
is
there
a
young
man
in
the
family
yes
well
i
want
to
know
him
find
a
way
of
presenting
me
to
him
will
you
sam
amazement
was
amusing
you
want
an
introduction
to
israel
rosenthal
i
have
said
so
well
everyone
to
his
taste
i
procure
you
one
this
evening
at
the
theatre
he
a
great
patron
of
the
lyceum
and
are
you
going
there
as
soon
as
you
release
me
very
good
expect
to
find
me
in
the
lobby
after
the
first
act
i
obliged
to
you
this
because
i
had
moved
out
of
his
way
i
have
seen
sam
when
he
was
personally
more
agreeable
to
me
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
what
play
i
saw
that
night
it
was
one
of
the
successes
of
the
season
but
it
meant
nothing
to
me
all
my
mind
and
attention
were
on
the
young
man
i
had
come
there
to
see
he
was
in
one
of
the
boxes
this
i
found
out
before
the
first
act
was
over
and
though
i
caught
flitting
glimpses
of
his
face
i
did
not
see
him
closely
enough
to
form
any
judgment
of
his
temper
or
disposition
when
the
first
act
was
over
i
went
into
the
lobby
but
sam
did
not
join
me
there
till
it
was
nearly
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
again
then
he
came
alone
he
be
out
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
he
remarked
the
wait
is
a
long
one
and
he
will
be
sure
to
improve
it
in
the
usual
way
i
nodded
and
sam
went
back
strange
to
say
he
was
interested
in
the
play
if
i
was
not
i
had
no
intention
of
forcing
an
immediate
disclosure
from
rosenthal
neither
the
time
nor
place
was
propitious
for
that
when
therefore
the
anticipated
moment
arrived
and
sam
sauntered
out
from
one
aisle
and
rosenthal
from
another
i
merely
pulled
myself
together
to
the
point
of
making
myself
agreeable
to
the
rather
unpromising
subject
of
my
present
interest
we
were
introduced
offhand
by
sam
who
if
he
did
not
like
the
job
and
it
was
very
evident
he
did
not
at
least
went
through
his
part
in
a
way
not
to
disturb
the
raw
pride
of
my
new
acquaintance
then
we
began
to
talk
and
i
thought
i
saw
more
than
ordinary
satisfaction
in
the
manner
with
which
young
rosenthal
received
my
advances
a
satisfaction
which
led
me
to
mentally
inquire
whether
his
pleasure
rose
from
gratification
at
underhill
attention
or
from
any
erroneous
idea
he
may
have
had
of
my
being
a
to
certain
desirable
acquaintances
or
more
important
still
was
he
for
reasons
i
was
not
as
yet
ready
to
dwell
upon
glad
to
know
a
man
whom
all
recognised
as
an
important
witness
in
the
great
affair
whose
unsolved
mystery
was
still
the
theme
of
half
the
town
i
curbed
my
impatience
and
was
eagerly
pursuing
the
conversation
towards
a
point
which
might
settle
this
disturbing
question
when
presto
the
curtain
rose
on
the
fourth
act
and
he
flew
to
regain
his
box
but
not
before
sam
with
a
i
shall
not
soon
forget
had
asked
him
round
to
our
apartments
after
the
play
which
invitation
young
rosenthal
seemed
glad
to
accept
for
he
nodded
with
great
eagerness
as
he
disappeared
around
the
curtains
of
the
doorway
so
much
to
humour
a
friend
growled
sam
as
he
too
started
for
his
seat
i
smiled
and
went
home
at
about
midnight
sam
came
in
with
my
expected
guest
and
we
had
a
rarebit
and
ale
in
the
midst
of
the
good
feeling
thus
established
rosenthal
broke
forth
in
the
very
explanation
i
had
been
expecting
from
the
first
i
say
you
were
with
old
gillespie
when
he
died
the
fact
is
well
known
i
returned
refraining
from
glancing
at
sam
though
much
inclined
to
do
so
well
i
a
mighty
curiosity
about
that
case
seems
somehow
as
if
i
had
had
a
hand
in
it
there
was
champagne
on
the
table
i
pushed
the
bottle
towards
sam
who
proceeded
to
open
it
while
this
was
going
on
i
answered
rosenthal
with
all
the
appearance
of
surprise
he
doubtless
expected
how
that
oh
i
think
i
understand
you
are
a
neighbour
all
who
live
near
them
must
feel
somewhat
as
you
do
it
is
that
he
protested
draining
his
glass
which
sam
immediately
refilled
i
have
never
told
anyone
i
do
know
why
i
tell
you
fellows
but
i
was
almost
in
at
that
death
you
see
the
windows
of
my
room
look
directly
down
on
the
little
den
in
which
he
died
and
i
chanced
to
be
looking
in
its
direction
just
as
here
he
stopped
to
enjoy
his
second
glass
as
the
rim
slowly
rose
obscuring
his
eyes
i
caught
an
admiring
hm
from
sam
which
filled
without
relieving
this
moment
of
suspense
as
the
glass
rang
down
again
on
the
table
rosenthal
finished
his
sentence
just
as
gillespie
lifted
his
window
to
empty
out
a
glass
of
something
now
what
was
that
something
i
have
asked
myself
a
dozen
times
since
his
death
but
this
is
evidence
this
is
a
fact
you
ought
to
have
communicated
to
the
police
broke
in
underhill
with
momentary
fire
perhaps
it
was
a
real
one
perhaps
it
was
the
means
he
used
to
draw
rosenthal
out
and
be
dragged
up
before
a
thousand
people
all
whispering
and
joggling
to
see
me
no
i
have
too
much
i
only
speak
of
it
now
said
he
with
great
dignity
because
i
so
deuced
curious
to
know
whether
it
was
poison
he
threw
out
a
dose
of
chloral
or
just
plain
wine
it
might
have
been
any
of
these
three
but
i
have
always
thought
it
was
the
first
because
he
seemed
so
afraid
of
being
seen
afraid
of
being
seen
drinking
it
or
of
throwing
it
out
throwing
it
out
oh
sam
and
i
stopped
helping
ourselves
to
wine
and
left
the
bottle
to
him
do
you
know
what
time
this
was
i
asked
no
how
should
i
it
was
before
ten
for
at
ten
he
was
dead
it
could
not
have
been
poison
he
threw
out
or
even
the
remains
of
it
i
remarked
for
that
would
imply
suicide
and
the
verdict
was
one
of
murder
rosenthal
was
just
far
enough
gone
to
accept
this
assertion
that
so
i
wonder
i
never
thought
of
that
before
then
it
must
have
been
wine
now
i
would
have
thought
so
badly
of
gillespie
as
that
i
always
considered
him
a
sensible
man
and
no
sensible
man
pours
wine
out
of
a
window
he
sapiently
remarked
raising
his
glass
it
was
empty
and
he
set
it
down
again
then
he
took
up
the
bottle
that
was
empty
too
grumbling
some
unintelligible
words
he
glanced
at
the
cabinet
we
failed
to
understand
him
there
are
but
two
excuses
for
a
man
who
deliberately
wastes
wine
he
proceeded
in
tipsy
argument
with
himself
either
he
has
had
enough
hard
to
think
that
of
gillespie
at
so
early
an
hour
in
the
evening
or
else
the
liquor
bad
now
only
a
fool
would
accuse
a
man
like
gillespie
of
having
bad
liquor
in
his
house
unless
unless
something
got
into
it
oh
he
suddenly
exclaimed
with
the
complacency
of
one
who
has
unexpectedly
made
a
remarkable
discovery
there
something
in
it
something
which
gave
it
a
bad
taste
prussic
acid
has
a
bad
taste
it
and
not
liking
the
taste
he
flung
the
wine
away
no
man
would
go
on
drinking
wine
with
prussic
acid
in
it
he
mumbled
on
now
which
of
those
fellows
was
it
who
poured
him
out
that
wine
we
sat
silent
both
bound
that
he
should
supply
his
own
answer
i
ought
to
know
i
read
about
it
enough
it
was
the
slick
one
the
fellow
who
goes
by
me
as
if
i
were
dirt
oh
i
know
it
leighton
leighton
and
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
with
a
sickening
leer
i
going
down
to
the
police
station
he
cried
i
going
to
inform
the
authorities
not
i
protested
rising
and
speaking
somewhat
forcibly
in
his
ear
if
you
go
there
they
will
shut
you
up
till
morning
jail
you
he
laughed
boisterously
that
would
be
a
joke
none
of
that
for
me
i
see
them
dashed
first
and
he
looked
at
us
with
a
sickly
smile
the
remembrance
of
which
will
make
me
hate
him
forever
suddenly
he
began
to
search
for
his
hat
i
think
i
go
home
he
observed
with
an
air
of
extreme
condescension
leighton
gillespie
eh
well
glad
the
question
is
settled
here
to
his
health
and
yours
and
yours
he
was
gone
we
were
both
on
our
feet
ready
to
assist
him
in
his
departure
but
he
got
away
in
good
shape
and
when
the
lower
door
slammed
we
congratulated
each
other
with
a
look
then
sam
seized
the
bottle
and
i
the
glass
from
which
this
fellow
had
drunk
and
both
fell
crashing
into
the
fireplace
then
sam
spoke
i
fear
leighton
gillespie
will
sleep
his
last
sound
sleep
you
must
consider
the
drivel
we
have
just
listened
to
as
of
some
importance
then
i
declared
taken
with
what
yox
told
us
i
certainly
do
was
sam
emphatic
reply
the
sigh
which
escaped
me
was
involuntary
if
this
was
sam
opinion
i
must
prepare
myself
for
an
interview
with
hope
alas
it
was
likely
to
bring
me
sorrow
in
proportion
to
the
joy
it
brought
her
xxiii
in
my
office
it
was
with
strange
reluctance
i
opened
the
paper
next
morning
though
i
had
no
reason
for
apprehending
that
my
adventure
of
the
day
before
had
been
shared
by
anyone
likely
to
give
information
in
regard
to
it
the
consciousness
of
holding
an
important
secret
is
so
akin
to
the
consciousness
of
guilt
i
could
not
help
dreading
some
reference
to
the
same
in
the
sheet
i
now
unfolded
i
wished
to
be
the
first
to
tell
miss
meredith
of
the
new
direction
in
which
suspicion
was
pointing
and
experienced
great
relief
when
upon
consulting
the
columns
usually
devoted
to
the
topic
of
the
gillespie
poisoning
case
i
came
upon
a
direct
intimation
of
the
necessity
now
universally
felt
of
holding
alfred
accountable
for
his
father
death
as
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
had
shown
himself
unable
to
explain
away
the
circumstantial
evidence
raised
against
him
this
expression
of
opinion
on
the
part
of
the
press
had
been
anticipated
too
long
by
miss
meredith
for
it
to
prove
a
shock
to
her
i
therefore
did
not
commit
myself
to
an
early
interview
but
went
at
once
to
my
office
where
important
business
awaited
me
i
was
in
the
midst
of
a
law
paper
when
i
was
warned
by
a
certain
nervous
perturbation
fast
becoming
too
common
with
me
that
someone
had
been
admitted
to
my
inner
office
and
now
stood
before
me
looking
up
i
saw
she
wore
a
thick
veil
and
was
clad
in
a
long
cloak
which
completely
enveloped
her
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
outlines
of
the
figure
which
had
dwelt
in
my
mind
and
heart
ever
since
the
fateful
night
of
our
first
meeting
or
the
attitude
with
which
she
awaited
my
invitation
to
enter
agitated
by
her
presence
which
was
totally
unexpected
in
that
place
i
rose
and
with
all
the
apparent
calmness
the
situation
demanded
i
welcomed
her
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
when
i
turned
back
it
was
to
meet
her
face
to
face
she
had
taken
off
her
veil
and
loosened
her
cloak
at
the
neck
and
as
the
latter
fell
apart
i
saw
that
the
left
hand
clutched
a
newspaper
i
no
longer
doubted
the
purpose
of
her
visit
she
had
seen
the
article
i
have
just
quoted
and
was
more
moved
by
it
than
i
had
expected
you
must
pardon
this
intrusion
she
began
ignoring
the
chair
i
had
set
for
her
i
have
seen
learned
something
which
grieves
alarms
me
you
are
my
lawyer
more
than
that
my
friend
i
have
no
other
so
i
have
come
here
she
sank
into
a
chair
first
drooping
her
head
then
looking
up
piteously
i
tried
to
give
her
the
support
she
asked
for
concealing
the
effect
of
her
emotion
upon
me
i
told
her
that
she
could
find
no
truer
friend
or
one
who
comprehended
her
more
intuitively
then
with
a
gesture
towards
the
paper
i
remarked
you
are
frightened
at
the
impatience
of
the
public
you
need
not
be
miss
meredith
there
are
always
certain
people
who
advocate
rash
methods
and
demand
any
bone
to
gnaw
rather
than
not
gnaw
at
all
the
police
are
more
circumspect
they
are
not
going
to
arrest
any
one
of
your
cousins
without
evidence
strong
enough
to
warrant
such
extreme
measures
do
not
worry
about
alfred
gillespie
it
will
not
be
his
name
but
with
a
leap
she
was
on
her
feet
whose
she
cried
meeting
my
astonished
gaze
with
such
an
agony
of
appeal
in
her
great
eyes
that
i
drew
back
appalled
it
was
not
alfred
then
she
loved
was
it
the
handsome
george
after
all
or
could
it
be
no
it
could
not
be
that
all
this
youth
all
this
beauty
nay
this
embodiment
of
truest
passion
and
devotion
had
fixed
itself
upon
the
unhappy
man
whom
i
had
just
decided
to
be
unworthy
of
any
woman
regard
aghast
at
the
prospect
i
plunged
on
wildly
desperately
but
with
a
certain
restraint
merciful
to
her
if
no
relief
to
me
george
too
seems
innocent
leighton
only
yes
it
was
he
i
saw
it
as
the
name
passed
my
lips
saw
it
even
before
she
gave
utterance
to
the
low
cry
with
which
she
fell
at
my
feet
in
an
attitude
of
entreaty
oh
she
murmured
do
say
it
i
can
not
bear
it
yet
no
schooling
has
made
me
ready
it
is
unheard
of
impossible
he
is
so
good
so
kind
so
full
of
lofty
thoughts
and
generous
impulses
i
would
sooner
suspect
myself
and
yet
oh
outhwaite
pity
me
every
support
is
gone
everything
in
which
i
trusted
or
held
to
if
he
is
the
base
the
despicable
wretch
they
say
where
shall
i
seek
for
goodness
trustworthiness
and
truth
i
had
no
heart
to
answer
so
it
was
upon
the
plainest
least
accomplished
and
to
all
appearance
least
responsive
as
well
as
least
responsible
of
gillespie
three
sons
she
had
fixed
her
affections
and
lavished
the
warm
emotions
of
her
passionate
young
life
why
had
i
not
guessed
it
why
had
i
let
george
handsome
figure
and
alfred
lazy
graces
blind
me
to
the
fact
that
woman
chooses
through
her
imagination
and
that
if
out
of
a
suitors
she
encounters
one
she
does
not
thoroughly
understand
he
is
sure
to
be
the
one
to
strike
her
untutored
fancy
alas
for
her
when
as
in
this
case
this
lack
of
mutual
understanding
is
founded
on
the
impossibility
of
a
pure
mind
comprehending
the
hidden
life
of
one
who
puts
no
restriction
upon
the
worst
side
of
his
nature
these
thoughts
were
instantaneous
but
they
made
a
dividing
line
in
my
life
henceforth
this
woman
in
all
her
alluring
beauty
was
in
a
way
sacred
to
me
like
a
child
we
find
astray
raising
her
from
the
appealing
posture
into
which
she
had
sunk
i
assured
her
with
as
much
gentleness
as
my
own
inner
rebellion
would
allow
you
have
not
trusted
him
yourself
or
you
would
let
no
newspaper
report
drive
you
here
for
solace
she
cringed
the
blow
had
told
but
she
struggled
on
with
a
feverish
desire
to
convince
herself
if
not
me
of
the
worth
of
him
she
loved
so
passionately
i
know
it
was
my
weakness
or
his
misfortune
he
had
given
me
no
cause
no
real
cause
his
eccentricities
my
uncle
impatience
with
them
my
own
difficulty
in
understanding
them
little
things
outhwaite
nothing
deep
nothing
convincing
i
can
not
explain
shadows
memories
so
slight
they
vanish
while
i
seek
them
i
would
have
given
worlds
not
to
have
been
shaken
in
my
faith
not
to
have
included
him
for
a
minute
in
the
accusation
of
that
phrase
of
my
sons
but
i
am
and
because
the
one
i
trusted
lived
by
had
not
been
exonerated
by
his
father
i
did
not
dare
to
separate
him
from
the
rest
in
the
doubts
his
father
accusation
had
raised
it
would
have
been
unjust
to
them
to
the
two
who
cared
most
for
me
the
two
here
her
voice
trailed
off
into
silence
only
to
rise
in
the
sudden
demand
what
has
occasioned
this
change
in
public
opinion
what
have
the
police
discovered
what
have
you
discovered
that
he
should
now
be
singled
out
he
against
whom
nothing
was
found
at
the
inquest
who
has
a
child
yet
who
allows
himself
to
lead
a
double
life
i
said
this
with
a
purpose
i
knew
what
its
effect
must
be
upon
so
pure
a
soul
and
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
emotion
she
displayed
yet
there
was
something
in
her
manner
as
she
pressed
her
two
hands
together
which
suggested
the
presence
of
a
different
feeling
from
the
one
i
had
expected
to
rouse
in
launching
this
poisoned
arrow
and
hesitating
with
new
doubt
i
went
falteringly
on
some
men
show
a
very
different
face
in
their
homes
and
before
their
friends
than
in
haunts
where
your
pure
imagination
can
not
follow
them
the
life
lived
under
your
eye
is
not
the
one
really
led
by
the
melancholy
being
you
have
watched
with
such
sympathetic
interest
she
did
not
seem
to
follow
me
what
do
you
mean
her
indignation
was
so
strong
that
she
leaped
to
her
feet
and
eyed
me
with
a
manifest
sense
of
outrage
you
speak
as
if
you
meant
something
i
should
not
hear
claire
father
it
was
a
difficult
task
surely
my
lines
had
fallen
in
untoward
places
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
my
duty
if
her
fresh
unspoiled
heart
had
made
its
home
in
a
nest
of
serpents
it
was
well
she
should
know
her
mistake
before
the
shame
of
the
discovery
should
overwhelm
her
turning
aside
so
that
i
should
not
seem
to
spy
upon
her
agitation
i
answered
her
as
such
questions
should
be
answered
with
the
truth
miss
meredith
said
i
when
i
undertook
to
sift
this
matter
and
if
possible
bring
to
light
some
fact
capable
of
settling
the
doubt
that
is
wearing
away
your
life
i
hoped
to
relieve
your
heart
and
restore
your
faith
in
the
one
cousin
most
congenial
to
you
that
i
have
failed
in
this
and
find
myself
called
upon
to
inflict
suffering
rather
than
to
bring
peace
to
your
agitated
heart
is
a
source
of
regret
to
myself
which
you
can
never
measure
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
dare
not
keep
back
the
truth
leighton
gillespie
is
unworthy
your
regard
miss
meredith
not
only
because
he
lies
under
suspicion
of
having
committed
the
worst
sin
in
the
calendar
but
because
he
has
deceived
you
as
to
the
state
of
his
own
affections
he
wait
her
voice
was
peremptory
her
manner
noble
i
wish
to
say
right
here
outhwaite
that
leighton
gillespie
has
never
deceived
me
in
this
regard
i
have
cared
for
him
because
because
i
could
not
help
it
but
he
has
never
led
me
into
doing
so
by
any
show
of
peculiar
interest
in
myself
george
has
courted
me
and
alfred
nearly
has
but
not
leighton
yet
to
him
my
whole
heart
went
out
and
if
it
is
a
shame
to
own
it
i
must
endure
that
shame
rather
than
injure
his
cause
by
leaving
you
under
the
influence
of
a
prejudice
which
has
no
foundation
in
fact
before
the
generosity
of
this
i
bowed
my
head
her
beauty
warm
and
glowing
as
it
was
at
this
moment
of
did
not
impress
me
so
much
as
the
mingled
candour
and
pride
with
which
she
exonerated
this
man
from
the
one
fault
of
which
she
knew
him
to
be
innocent
it
gave
me
a
new
respect
for
her
and
a
shade
more
of
forbearance
for
him
so
that
my
voice
softened
as
i
replied
well
well
we
will
not
charge
him
with
deliberate
falsehood
towards
you
only
with
the
madness
which
leads
a
man
to
sacrifice
honour
and
reputation
to
the
fancied
charms
of
an
irresponsible
woman
he
is
under
a
spell
miss
meredith
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
name
the
object
of
it
i
have
myself
seen
and
it
was
from
her
hand
possibly
without
her
understanding
the
purpose
for
which
he
wanted
it
as
she
has
no
appearance
of
being
a
really
wicked
woman
that
he
obtained
the
poison
which
did
such
deadly
work
in
your
uncle
house
the
worst
was
said
and
the
silence
that
followed
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
by
her
or
by
me
when
it
was
broken
it
was
by
hope
and
in
words
which
came
in
such
starts
and
with
such
pauses
i
could
only
guess
their
meaning
through
my
own
identification
with
her
shame
and
grief
calumny
it
can
not
be
so
good
so
thoughtful
in
his
bringing
up
of
claire
that
day
he
pulled
her
aside
lest
she
should
stumble
against
the
little
boy
with
the
broken
arm
it
is
a
dream
a
horrible
dream
he
depraved
he
a
buyer
of
poison
no
no
no
not
but
the
evil
spirit
that
sometimes
possesses
him
leighton
gillespie
in
his
true
hours
is
a
man
to
confide
in
to
regard
with
honour
to
to
to
i
no
longer
made
an
effort
at
listening
she
was
not
addressing
me
but
her
own
soul
with
which
for
the
moment
she
stood
apart
in
the
great
loneliness
which
an
overwhelming
catastrophe
creates
she
did
not
even
remember
my
presence
and
i
did
not
dare
recall
it
to
her
i
simply
let
her
lose
herself
in
her
own
grief
while
i
fought
my
own
battle
and
as
i
hope
won
my
own
victory
but
this
could
not
last
she
suddenly
awoke
to
the
nearness
of
listening
ears
and
flushing
deeply
ceased
the
broken
flow
of
words
which
had
so
worn
upon
my
heart
and
regaining
some
of
her
lost
composure
forcibly
declared
you
are
an
honest
man
outhwaite
and
i
am
told
a
reliable
lawyer
you
have
too
much
feeling
and
judgment
to
malign
a
man
already
labouring
under
the
accusation
which
unites
this
whole
family
in
one
cloud
of
suspicion
tell
me
then
do
you
positively
know
leighton
to
have
done
what
you
say
alas
was
my
short
but
suggestive
reply
instantly
she
ceased
to
struggle
and
with
a
calmness
hardly
to
be
expected
from
her
after
such
a
display
of
feeling
she
surveyed
me
earnestly
for
a
moment
then
said
tell
me
the
whole
story
i
have
a
reason
for
hearing
it
a
reason
which
you
would
approve
let
me
hear
what
you
learned
what
you
saw
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
papers
i
have
only
found
there
a
general
allusion
to
him
calculated
to
prepare
the
mind
for
some
great
disclosure
and
her
hand
tightened
upon
the
sheet
which
i
now
discovered
to
be
the
one
morning
journal
i
had
failed
to
see
you
will
pay
no
attention
to
my
feelings
i
have
none
we
are
sitting
in
court
let
me
hear
respecting
her
emotion
respecting
the
attitude
in
which
she
had
placed
me
i
did
as
she
requested
with
all
the
succinctness
possible
i
told
her
how
i
had
been
led
to
go
to
mother
merry
and
what
i
had
discovered
there
then
i
related
what
we
had
learned
from
rosenthal
the
narrative
was
long
and
gave
me
ample
opportunity
for
studying
its
effect
upon
her
but
she
made
no
betrayal
of
her
feelings
perhaps
as
she
had
said
she
had
none
at
this
moment
with
her
hand
clenched
on
her
knee
she
sat
listening
so
intently
that
all
her
other
faculties
seemed
to
have
been
suspended
for
this
purpose
only
as
i
approached
the
end
i
noticed
that
the
grey
shadow
which
had
hung
over
her
from
the
first
had
deepened
to
a
pall
beneath
which
the
last
vestige
of
her
abounding
youth
had
vanished
my
own
heart
grew
heavy
as
the
gladness
left
hers
and
i
was
nearly
as
desolate
as
she
when
i
made
this
final
remark
that
is
all
miss
meredith
i
as
truly
believe
that
leighton
gillespie
bought
the
bottle
of
poison
from
the
girl
he
called
as
if
i
had
seen
him
laying
the
money
down
before
her
but
rosenthal
admissions
you
must
take
at
your
own
valuation
he
says
he
saw
your
uncle
with
backward
looks
and
signs
of
secret
fear
and
disturbance
pour
out
something
from
a
glass
on
to
the
underneath
his
open
window
was
it
the
wine
which
had
been
given
him
by
leighton
and
did
he
do
this
because
of
the
drug
he
had
detected
in
it
a
drug
alas
so
fatal
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
drink
the
full
glass
in
order
to
succumb
to
it
that
is
a
question
you
must
answer
in
your
mind
from
the
knowledge
you
have
of
your
uncle
and
his
family
there
was
a
hope
held
out
in
this
last
phrase
which
i
expected
to
see
her
embrace
but
she
did
not
on
the
contrary
her
depression
remained
unchanged
and
she
said
i
knew
my
uncle
well
he
was
a
just
man
and
in
times
of
great
danger
a
cool
one
he
would
never
have
written
for
my
eyes
those
four
words
of
my
sons
unless
some
new
fact
had
added
certainty
to
his
former
conviction
the
drug
was
in
the
wine
handed
him
by
leighton
we
must
accept
that
fact
whatever
it
may
cost
us
her
calmness
amazed
me
for
the
last
few
minutes
she
seemed
upborne
by
some
secret
thought
i
could
neither
fathom
nor
understand
but
suddenly
her
old
horror
returned
with
the
recurrence
of
some
old
memory
then
it
was
his
hand
that
stole
towards
my
uncle
glass
in
the
dark
she
cried
that
murderous
creeping
hand
the
vision
of
which
has
haunted
me
night
and
day
since
i
heard
of
it
oh
horrible
horrible
what
a
curse
to
fall
upon
a
man
it
is
the
work
of
the
poor
leighton
poor
leighton
she
cried
in
her
agony
bowing
her
head
she
sobbed
bitterly
while
i
surveyed
her
in
amazement
i
did
not
understand
her
she
seemed
to
be
weeping
for
leighton
not
for
herself
at
all
events
she
did
not
show
the
repulsion
i
expected
from
her
in
face
of
such
monstrous
depravity
was
the
fascination
he
exerted
over
her
so
great
that
she
could
not
weigh
at
their
proper
value
characteristics
so
entirely
evil
it
did
not
seem
possible
yet
there
she
sat
mourning
for
him
instead
of
crushing
the
very
thought
of
him
out
of
her
heart
i
think
i
comprehend
it
all
now
she
finally
whispered
half
to
herself
and
half
to
me
i
have
had
the
thought
before
it
has
come
when
that
bewildering
look
of
mad
uneasiness
has
crossed
his
face
and
he
has
left
us
to
be
gone
days
sometimes
weeks
without
notice
or
explanation
it
is
a
strange
idea
a
secret
almost
an
uncanny
one
but
it
is
the
only
one
that
can
explain
a
crime
for
which
one
and
all
of
my
cousins
seem
to
lack
the
inherent
baseness
dare
i
breathe
it
to
you
it
may
be
the
saving
of
leighton
if
true
god
knows
it
is
my
only
excuse
for
clinging
to
him
still
and
you
do
cling
to
him
still
i
asked
knowing
what
her
answer
would
be
but
hoping
against
hope
the
look
she
gave
recalled
all
her
old
beauty
would
that
i
might
have
been
the
cause
of
it
or
that
a
woman
would
love
where
she
was
loved
and
not
where
her
heart
must
encounter
disgrace
and
bitter
suffering
i
can
not
help
doing
so
she
murmured
he
will
soon
need
my
aid
if
not
my
comfort
for
i
know
what
these
horrible
contradictions
mean
i
understand
them
understand
him
and
even
the
revolting
crime
of
which
he
may
have
been
guilty
hypocrisy
does
not
explain
it
depravity
does
not
explain
it
his
good
acts
are
too
real
the
nobility
of
his
nature
too
unmistakable
disease
alone
can
account
for
it
he
is
the
victim
of
double
consciousness
and
he
leads
two
lives
your
own
expression
because
the
two
hemispheres
of
his
brain
do
not
act
in
unison
wickedness
is
not
his
normal
condition
his
normal
condition
is
a
noble
one
by
nature
he
is
a
man
devoted
to
good
works
and
high
thoughts
when
he
goes
astray
it
is
because
the
balance
of
his
faculties
has
been
disturbed
this
is
no
new
thing
to
the
psychologist
you
yourself
have
heard
of
men
so
afflicted
leighton
gillespie
is
one
was
her
own
brain
turned
by
her
terror
anxiety
and
wonder
surely
she
was
either
mad
or
playing
with
my
common
sense
but
the
calm
dignity
of
her
manner
proved
that
she
had
advanced
this
astonishing
this
fantastic
explanation
of
leighton
gillespie
contradictory
actions
in
good
faith
despair
seized
me
at
this
proof
of
his
tenacious
hold
upon
her
and
i
could
not
quite
restrain
a
touch
of
irony
you
would
make
him
out
a
sort
of
jekyll
and
hyde
i
ventured
alas
i
fear
the
courts
do
not
take
into
account
the
theories
of
the
romancer
in
their
judgment
of
criminals
the
sarcasm
passed
unheeded
growing
more
and
more
beautiful
as
her
earnestness
increased
she
said
with
simple
confidence
talk
to
bennett
he
has
known
my
cousin
almost
from
his
birth
ask
what
these
sudden
changes
mean
in
a
man
whose
primal
instincts
have
always
been
good
ask
why
this
devoted
father
this
kind
son
suddenly
loses
himself
it
may
be
at
table
it
may
be
while
sitting
with
his
own
child
by
the
fire
and
deaf
to
all
remonstrance
blind
to
the
most
touching
appeals
of
those
about
him
goes
suddenly
out
and
does
not
come
back
till
he
can
be
himself
again
in
the
presence
of
his
family
and
under
the
eye
of
his
friends
previous
to
that
awful
morning
when
my
uncle
unsealed
to
my
eyes
the
horrible
secret
that
rested
like
a
cloud
over
the
household
i
used
to
give
another
explanation
to
these
varying
moods
and
see
in
them
a
promise
of
more
personal
hopes
and
an
augury
of
my
own
future
happiness
so
easy
is
it
for
a
woman
to
deceive
herself
when
she
worships
a
man
without
fully
comprehending
him
i
thought
here
her
calm
candour
grew
almost
heroic
in
the
effort
she
made
to
impress
me
with
the
reasons
she
cherished
for
her
belief
i
thought
he
was
jealous
of
george
or
angry
with
alfred
and
was
driven
away
by
his
fears
of
or
his
dread
of
being
led
into
making
unworthy
reprisals
but
now
i
see
that
it
was
his
abnormal
nature
which
had
come
into
play
a
nature
of
which
he
may
be
ignorant
when
in
full
health
and
for
the
manifestations
of
which
he
may
be
no
more
responsible
than
we
are
for
the
vagaries
we
commit
in
dreams
you
have
not
read
the
latest
discoveries
in
hypnotism
i
rejoined
a
man
can
be
driven
into
no
act
for
which
he
lacks
the
natural
instinct
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
cruel
miss
meredith
i
am
too
sincere
in
my
desire
to
save
you
unnecessary
pain
and
heartache
since
you
wish
it
i
will
see
bennett
but
my
smile
seemed
to
unnerve
her
but
you
do
not
think
he
will
agree
with
me
in
my
interpretation
of
this
crime
and
leighton
connection
with
it
i
do
not
miss
meredith
then
she
cried
with
a
high
look
and
a
gleam
of
quiet
resolve
that
made
me
realise
how
small
was
my
influence
in
face
of
her
overpowering
love
for
this
man
god
will
be
done
i
shall
believe
in
what
i
have
said
till
he
whom
i
have
trusted
is
proved
the
heinous
malefactor
you
consider
him
when
that
hour
comes
i
perish
killed
by
the
greatest
shame
that
can
overwhelm
a
woman
to
love
one
who
has
never
sought
your
affection
may
cause
the
cheek
to
burn
and
the
heart
to
recoil
upon
itself
but
to
have
given
all
one
youth
and
the
most
cherished
impulses
of
the
heart
to
a
man
who
is
no
more
than
a
whited
sepulchre
of
deceit
and
revolting
crime
that
would
be
to
sap
life
at
its
spring
and
tear
up
the
heart
by
its
roots
oh
outhwaite
forgetting
all
womanly
delicacy
forgetting
everything
but
your
forbearance
and
the
confidence
with
which
you
inspire
me
i
have
poured
out
my
soul
before
you
prove
to
me
that
this
man
is
good
moral
in
his
instincts
i
mean
except
when
the
evil
spirit
has
a
grip
upon
him
and
i
will
bless
you
as
the
saviour
of
my
but
if
you
can
not
here
she
turned
pale
and
tottered
then
do
not
expect
me
to
survive
i
i
could
not
the
alternative
was
a
bitter
one
i
did
not
see
at
that
moment
how
she
could
expect
still
less
how
i
could
perform
such
a
miracle
but
i
could
not
see
her
depart
without
some
gleam
of
encouragement
and
so
i
told
her
that
if
the
tide
turned
so
as
to
free
alfred
from
suspicion
and
land
leighton
in
the
courts
i
would
embrace
the
opportunity
thus
offered
to
do
all
that
lay
in
my
power
to
prove
her
theory
a
true
one
and
with
this
understanding
between
us
she
went
away
leaving
me
to
take
up
with
what
courage
i
could
my
own
broken
and
disjointed
life
xxiv
an
old
catastrophe
is
recalled
this
idea
as
advanced
by
hope
was
fantastical
to
a
degree
yet
it
made
its
impression
upon
me
and
was
still
in
my
mind
when
i
opened
the
evening
paper
for
the
latest
news
concerning
the
gillespie
murder
the
first
paragraph
i
encountered
proved
that
i
had
not
warned
her
an
hour
too
soon
of
leighton
gillespie
position
fresh
disclosures
in
the
gillespie
poisoning
case
leighton
gillespie
long
regarded
as
the
most
respectable
and
hitherto
son
of
the
murdered
man
discovered
to
have
been
for
years
the
owner
and
at
times
the
occupant
of
a
little
house
in
one
of
the
oranges
where
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
here
followed
some
open
allusions
to
other
statements
were
added
to
this
among
them
a
of
the
facts
advanced
to
me
the
evening
before
by
rosenthal
at
the
end
were
these
lines
the
district
attorney
has
the
whole
matter
in
charge
and
the
public
is
promised
some
decided
action
i
folded
the
paper
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
went
directly
to
bennett
office
i
had
not
seen
the
good
physician
since
the
inquest
and
naturally
the
sight
of
his
face
recalled
the
strange
and
moving
incidents
which
had
first
brought
us
together
but
i
made
no
allusion
to
these
past
experiences
and
his
first
remark
was
wholly
professional
i
hope
it
is
not
as
a
patient
i
see
you
mr
outhwaite
with
a
shake
of
the
head
i
took
out
the
newspaper
i
had
been
careful
to
bring
with
me
and
pointed
out
the
paragraph
concerning
leighton
and
is
this
news
to
you
i
asked
i
make
the
inquiry
solely
in
the
interests
of
miss
meredith
who
has
hitherto
had
unbounded
confidence
in
this
cousin
he
glanced
at
the
lines
frowned
and
then
with
a
pained
look
replied
i
do
not
believe
this
of
leighton
he
of
all
gillespie
sons
is
the
furthest
removed
from
the
suspicion
connecting
them
with
the
crime
which
has
wrecked
their
good
name
he
is
incapable
of
any
serious
incapable
even
of
what
these
lines
suggest
i
have
known
him
from
his
birth
i
would
gladly
have
left
this
physician
in
undisturbed
possession
of
this
confidence
but
the
situation
was
too
serious
to
trifle
with
he
enjoys
a
good
name
i
allowed
and
has
even
been
known
to
exert
himself
in
many
acts
of
benevolence
towards
the
unfortunate
and
the
suffering
but
some
natures
and
they
are
frequently
those
from
which
most
is
to
be
expected
have
a
reverse
side
which
will
not
bear
the
scrutiny
either
of
their
friends
or
the
world
at
large
leighton
gillespie
has
one
of
these
natures
this
story
of
the
little
house
is
true
the
doctor
who
was
evidently
heart
and
soul
with
this
family
showed
a
distress
at
this
avowal
which
spoke
well
for
the
hold
which
this
especial
member
of
it
had
upon
his
affections
seeing
that
while
not
ready
to
question
my
word
he
was
anxious
to
know
the
sources
of
my
information
i
was
about
to
enter
upon
the
necessary
explanations
when
he
forestalled
me
by
saying
there
have
always
been
unexplained
traits
in
this
man
he
stands
alone
among
the
other
members
of
the
family
he
has
neither
the
social
qualities
of
george
nor
the
luxurious
tastes
of
alfred
nor
is
he
like
his
father
i
who
knew
his
mother
well
have
no
difficulty
in
attributing
to
their
correct
source
the
religious
tendencies
which
form
so
distinct
a
part
of
his
character
but
the
melancholy
which
pervades
his
life
is
not
an
inheritance
but
the
result
of
nervous
shock
incident
upon
an
extreme
grief
in
early
life
and
while
i
do
not
profess
to
understand
him
or
the
many
peculiarities
to
which
his
father
rightfully
raised
objection
i
am
positive
that
he
will
never
be
found
guilty
of
a
depraved
act
i
am
ready
to
stake
my
reputation
on
it
you
should
talk
with
miss
meredith
i
suggested
she
believes
or
endeavours
to
believe
in
him
also
but
even
she
finds
herself
forced
to
accept
the
truth
of
this
report
the
facts
favouring
it
are
too
unmistakable
i
can
myself
supply
evidence
enough
to
make
his
guilt
in
this
regard
quite
sure
and
without
preamble
i
entered
upon
a
detailed
account
of
the
discoveries
made
by
me
at
mother
merry
they
were
as
you
well
know
convincing
in
their
nature
and
allowed
but
two
conclusions
to
be
drawn
either
leighton
gillespie
was
a
monster
of
hypocrisy
or
he
was
the
victim
of
the
mental
derangement
so
fondly
suggested
by
hope
this
last
explanation
i
left
to
the
perspicacity
of
the
trained
physician
would
he
seize
upon
it
as
she
did
or
would
he
fail
to
see
in
these
results
any
symptoms
of
the
strange
mental
malady
alluded
to
by
hope
i
watched
him
anxiously
evidently
no
such
explanation
was
likely
to
suggest
itself
to
him
unaided
indeed
his
next
words
proved
how
far
any
such
conclusion
was
from
his
mind
you
overwhelm
me
said
he
it
was
hard
enough
to
look
upon
george
or
alfred
as
capable
of
a
crime
so
despicable
but
leighton
i
shall
have
to
readjust
all
my
memories
and
all
my
fancied
relations
with
this
family
if
is
to
be
looked
upon
with
suspicion
then
there
is
claire
pardon
me
i
ventured
in
vague
apology
for
an
interruption
which
seemed
out
of
place
from
a
stranger
have
you
looked
upon
leighton
as
a
well
man
you
speak
of
a
great
grief
the
loss
of
his
wife
i
supposed
so
now
could
this
grief
have
disturbed
the
even
balance
of
his
mind
so
as
to
make
these
abnormal
developments
possible
did
he
show
the
inconsistencies
you
mention
prior
to
the
event
you
speak
of
it
might
be
well
to
inquire
insanity
he
intimated
will
that
be
the
plea
do
you
think
it
can
be
advanced
he
has
not
yet
been
arrested
or
even
openly
accused
but
i
am
confident
he
will
be
and
soon
and
it
is
well
for
his
friends
to
be
prepared
that
is
a
question
i
can
not
answer
without
serious
thought
rejoined
the
doctor
restlessly
pacing
the
room
intimately
as
i
have
been
associated
with
him
i
have
never
for
a
moment
felt
myself
called
upon
to
doubt
his
perfect
sanity
does
miss
meredith
regard
his
eccentricities
in
this
light
miss
meredith
inherent
belief
in
the
goodness
of
this
favourite
cousin
leads
her
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
her
doubts
she
regards
him
as
a
man
cursed
by
recurrent
aberrations
of
mind
in
other
words
a
victim
of
double
consciousness
hope
does
what
does
she
know
about
the
nice
distinctions
governing
this
peculiar
condition
she
must
have
brought
all
her
imagination
to
bear
on
the
subject
to
find
such
an
excuse
for
his
contradictory
actions
this
argues
a
great
partiality
for
him
on
her
part
she
must
be
in
love
with
leighton
i
was
silent
the
doctor
amazement
was
very
genuine
well
i
never
suspected
her
of
any
such
preference
i
have
had
an
idea
at
times
that
she
favoured
alfred
rather
than
george
but
i
never
thought
of
her
being
caught
by
leighton
melancholy
countenance
and
eccentric
ways
well
women
are
an
incomprehensible
lot
the
only
widower
amongst
the
three
the
only
one
not
likely
to
be
affected
by
her
partiality
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
it
her
theory
we
are
interested
in
a
strange
one
a
very
strange
one
suddenly
he
grew
thoughtful
but
not
an
impossible
one
was
his
final
comment
the
shock
he
sustained
might
account
for
almost
anything
such
restrained
natures
have
great
depths
and
are
subject
to
great
reactions
i
must
study
the
case
i
can
give
no
offhand
opinion
upon
it
the
contradictions
observable
in
his
conduct
are
not
normal
and
certainly
show
disease
what
was
the
question
you
asked
me
he
suddenly
inquired
whether
he
showed
his
present
peculiarities
prior
to
the
death
of
his
wife
i
do
think
he
did
really
i
do
think
he
did
he
was
reserved
in
his
ways
unhappy
out
of
tune
with
his
father
because
that
father
failed
to
appreciate
the
he
had
foisted
upon
him
but
he
showed
these
feelings
naturally
and
not
at
all
as
he
showed
them
later
have
you
heard
the
current
gossip
concerning
his
marriage
not
at
all
save
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
one
and
created
as
you
say
a
certain
barrier
between
him
and
his
father
yes
it
was
an
unfortunate
one
the
whole
thing
was
unfortunate
so
much
so
that
his
friends
felt
a
decided
relief
when
young
gillespie
died
but
her
husband
regarded
this
loss
as
an
irreparable
one
he
was
wrapped
up
in
her
when
she
was
alive
and
as
you
now
call
to
mind
has
never
been
the
same
man
since
her
death
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
no
outlet
for
his
grief
his
father
would
not
hear
her
name
mentioned
and
little
claire
was
too
young
to
even
remember
her
mother
fortunately
perhaps
the
last
words
were
said
in
his
throat
and
opened
up
a
wide
abyss
of
possibilities
into
which
i
had
not
the
curiosity
to
penetrate
i
only
felt
impelled
to
ask
was
her
death
attended
with
any
unusual
circumstance
that
you
speak
of
his
sorrow
as
a
shock
for
reply
he
went
to
his
desk
and
after
some
fumbling
brought
out
several
slips
of
paper
from
among
which
he
chose
one
which
he
passed
over
to
me
i
have
kept
this
account
of
a
very
tragic
occurrence
for
reasons
you
will
appreciate
on
reading
it
i
took
the
slip
and
perused
it
with
no
apology
for
its
length
i
introduce
it
here
as
you
will
see
it
is
an
engineer
account
of
the
extraordinary
accident
which
took
place
on
the
and
road
some
years
ago
it
begins
abruptly
the
extract
having
been
closely
clipped
from
the
columns
of
the
paper
containing
it
illustration
big
hill
is
only
twelve
miles
long
and
has
a
grade
averaging
feet
to
the
mile
and
the
principal
part
of
the
grade
is
in
spots
six
loaded
cars
made
a
train
up
this
hill
and
the
train
of
six
cars
was
hauled
and
pushed
up
the
grade
by
two
engines
my
engine
was
stationed
permanently
on
the
hill
and
its
duty
was
to
couple
to
the
back
end
of
one
of
these
trains
and
help
it
up
the
grade
at
the
top
of
the
hill
was
a
called
acton
but
no
telegraph
operator
was
stationed
there
at
the
foot
of
the
grade
was
buckley
a
telegraph
office
in
the
centre
of
a
big
system
used
for
breaking
up
trains
before
sending
them
up
the
grade
in
sections
eight
miles
below
buckley
was
an
abandoned
mining
town
named
campton
here
was
a
set
of
and
switches
and
a
dozen
unoccupied
shanties
while
the
disused
telegraph
office
was
occupied
by
a
pensioner
of
the
company
a
flagman
and
his
daughter
twelve
miles
further
down
the
line
was
mountain
springs
now
one
of
the
foremost
summer
resorts
in
the
mountains
and
even
twenty
years
ago
much
frequented
by
eastern
i
explain
this
so
that
you
will
readily
understand
what
happened
we
had
run
no
up
the
hill
and
were
ordered
on
to
the
at
acton
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
no
the
through
train
from
the
south
that
was
coming
north
as
a
and
with
a
third
big
engine
pushing
her
no
was
a
regular
but
was
making
this
trip
as
an
excursion
train
and
was
made
up
of
eight
coaches
crowded
with
people
from
mountain
springs
as
the
freight
we
were
shoving
came
to
a
my
fireman
leaped
to
the
ground
and
uncoupled
the
engine
from
the
last
car
and
i
backed
down
over
the
switch
and
then
ran
ahead
on
the
while
this
was
being
done
a
brakeman
had
cut
the
train
in
front
of
the
last
two
cars
and
the
regular
engine
in
front
had
started
ahead
with
the
other
cars
towards
the
north
switch
to
back
the
four
cars
in
on
the
spur
as
i
shut
off
steam
and
centred
the
reverse
lever
i
saw
that
the
two
cars
were
moving
slowly
down
the
hill
and
i
watched
them
only
long
enough
to
see
the
rear
brakeman
clamber
up
the
and
seize
the
then
i
tried
the
water
in
the
boiler
started
the
injector
and
again
glanced
at
the
cars
evidently
the
brake
on
the
first
car
was
out
of
order
as
the
cars
were
moving
more
rapidly
and
the
brakeman
was
hastening
towards
the
brake
on
the
second
car
he
grasped
it
and
swung
around
and
nearly
fell
to
the
ground
the
was
broken
and
there
was
nothing
to
hold
the
cars
in
an
instant
the
picture
of
an
awful
horror
flashed
before
my
eyes
no
crowded
with
passengers
was
coming
and
those
cars
running
at
terrific
speed
would
crash
into
the
train
carrying
death
and
destruction
to
scores
if
not
hundreds
the
scene
at
the
moment
the
realisation
of
the
impending
disaster
came
over
me
is
before
me
now
as
plainly
as
on
that
day
nearly
five
years
ago
the
moving
cars
the
brakeman
stumbling
towards
the
to
descend
the
fireman
who
was
more
than
a
little
deaf
walking
away
without
seeing
or
hearing
what
had
occurred
and
in
his
place
a
man
i
had
almost
said
a
gentleman
standing
by
the
and
gazing
towards
the
cars
with
eyes
that
reflected
the
horror
in
my
own
while
thirty
miles
below
on
the
line
of
the
twisted
winding
track
a
faint
blur
of
smoke
that
told
me
no
had
left
mountain
springs
before
the
moving
cars
crossed
the
switch
we
all
knew
what
must
be
done
the
man
who
for
all
his
good
clothes
must
have
been
some
fireman
off
duty
had
thrown
the
switch
and
then
seeing
that
my
own
man
was
too
far
off
to
meet
this
emergency
had
swung
himself
on
to
the
back
of
the
tank
and
old
was
in
pursuit
of
the
runaways
the
brakeman
remained
to
close
the
switch
and
the
stranger
was
bracing
himself
to
couple
the
engine
to
the
cars
when
we
should
approach
them
no
steam
is
ever
used
going
down
that
hill
at
the
top
of
the
incline
the
is
closed
and
the
speed
of
the
train
is
controlled
by
the
but
as
the
stranger
who
had
boarded
the
engine
took
his
stand
on
the
i
opened
the
throttle
wide
to
give
her
a
start
then
put
on
the
air
until
i
had
her
under
control
and
then
away
we
went
the
runaway
cars
were
fully
one
hundred
yards
ahead
as
we
crossed
the
switch
and
were
moving
apparently
at
the
rate
of
eight
or
ten
miles
an
hour
with
rapidly
increasing
momentum
in
sixty
seconds
old
was
running
fifty
miles
an
hour
and
in
thirty
seconds
more
we
were
close
to
the
cars
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
man
in
front
shouting
something
and
knowing
that
it
was
to
slow
down
in
order
to
approach
the
cars
without
a
crash
i
applied
the
air
a
slight
jolt
told
me
that
the
engine
and
car
had
come
together
and
after
waiting
an
instant
to
give
my
unknown
assistant
time
to
drop
the
pin
in
place
i
pulled
the
to
lessen
the
speed
as
the
engine
slowed
under
the
pressure
of
the
brake
i
saw
the
cars
glide
away
from
us
he
had
missed
the
coupling
again
engine
and
cars
came
together
and
again
i
applied
the
air
with
the
same
result
we
were
running
now
at
a
speed
of
sixty
or
seventy
miles
an
hour
and
when
you
consider
that
the
track
on
the
hill
is
the
crookedest
ever
surveyed
by
an
engineer
cut
up
by
deep
ravines
and
canyons
and
leading
along
high
precipices
you
can
appreciate
the
danger
of
the
run
down
the
hill
we
thundered
swinging
through
deep
cuts
and
around
sharp
curves
the
engine
swaying
and
swinging
on
her
springs
as
if
struggling
in
an
effort
to
dash
herself
into
one
of
the
gorges
lining
the
track
the
engine
was
surrounded
by
rolling
clouds
of
dust
through
which
at
times
i
caught
glimpses
of
the
cars
pitching
and
tossing
like
some
dismantled
vessel
in
a
storm
at
sea
i
knew
the
cars
might
jump
the
track
at
any
moment
and
ditch
the
locomotive
sending
the
fireman
and
myself
to
quick
death
but
we
must
take
the
chances
so
long
as
there
was
a
possibility
of
stopping
the
runaways
again
and
again
we
tried
to
make
the
coupling
but
failed
each
time
i
did
not
know
until
all
was
over
the
difficulties
which
the
stranger
was
experiencing
the
drawhead
in
the
car
was
the
bumper
a
we
call
it
now
and
was
so
loose
in
its
socket
that
it
had
to
be
raised
six
or
eight
inches
and
held
in
position
while
the
link
was
being
put
in
place
this
required
two
hands
and
as
he
could
not
maintain
his
position
on
the
swaying
without
using
one
hand
to
cling
to
the
handrail
he
could
not
get
the
link
in
place
and
drop
the
pin
through
it
by
this
time
we
were
within
three
miles
of
buckley
as
the
locomotive
and
fleeting
cars
dashed
across
a
trestle
one
hundred
feet
high
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
little
telegraph
shanty
down
in
the
valley
surrounded
by
a
network
of
rails
i
opened
the
whistle
and
kept
it
shrieking
until
we
were
within
two
hundred
yards
of
buckley
but
no
one
appeared
on
the
station
platform
and
as
we
flashed
past
the
telegraph
office
the
white
face
of
the
operator
his
eyes
wide
open
with
alarm
and
horror
appeared
at
the
window
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
as
we
dashed
past
the
telegraph
office
the
long
arm
of
the
pointed
down
and
i
thanked
god
that
the
next
block
was
still
open
and
that
we
had
another
chance
for
life
we
had
eight
miles
of
clear
track
and
might
yet
prevent
a
disaster
the
only
hope
however
was
in
catching
the
runaway
cars
as
there
was
no
telegraph
office
at
campton
and
no
had
left
mountain
springs
and
was
booming
towards
us
as
fast
as
three
big
engines
could
send
her
and
without
a
stop
ahead
we
crossed
the
of
at
buckley
so
fast
that
there
was
an
unbroken
rattle
of
clanking
rails
and
swung
around
the
point
of
the
mountain
and
down
the
winding
track
towards
campton
over
swaying
bridges
through
cuts
old
jolted
us
along
at
the
rate
of
seventy
or
eighty
miles
an
hour
in
two
minutes
after
crossing
the
yards
at
buckley
we
were
within
sight
of
campton
nestling
below
us
in
the
valley
the
man
on
the
had
been
silent
seemingly
for
hours
and
whether
he
was
still
at
his
post
or
had
fallen
on
the
rails
and
been
ground
to
pieces
i
did
not
know
i
realised
now
that
there
was
no
longer
a
possibility
of
stopping
the
cars
by
coupling
to
them
and
what
my
hope
was
if
i
had
any
at
all
i
do
not
know
there
was
only
a
mad
determination
to
follow
those
runaway
cars
to
the
end
and
die
with
the
rest
as
the
roofs
of
campton
came
into
view
the
whistle
began
to
sound
again
three
miles
below
lay
the
mining
camp
now
i
could
see
the
rough
board
station
the
red
and
white
switch
targets
and
the
dark
spots
on
the
that
marked
the
abandoned
then
i
distinguished
a
form
on
the
station
platform
a
slender
form
in
dark
calico
and
wearing
a
the
woman
back
was
towards
me
but
i
knew
her
to
be
nettie
bascom
the
daughter
of
the
flagman
it
was
ten
seconds
perhaps
before
the
girl
heard
the
whistle
then
she
turned
slowly
looking
an
instant
towards
us
and
with
a
quick
spring
was
at
a
and
had
thrown
the
lever
and
the
white
of
the
target
turned
to
red
and
we
were
safe
but
not
so
the
passenger
train
the
cars
had
passed
over
the
switch
before
it
could
be
turned
and
in
another
moment
the
sound
of
its
bounding
wheels
our
own
cries
and
all
the
other
noises
of
the
dreadful
moment
were
drowned
by
an
explosion
that
lifted
old
off
the
rails
and
laid
everyone
within
sight
insensible
on
the
road
those
cars
which
we
had
chased
unavailingly
for
thirty
miles
or
more
were
laden
with
dynamite
and
when
they
crashed
into
that
train
do
you
ask
about
the
man
who
shared
my
peril
and
all
to
so
little
purpose
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
him
whether
my
former
conclusion
was
correct
and
he
had
been
shaken
from
his
narrow
hold
into
some
ditch
or
gully
or
whether
he
was
hurled
to
destruction
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
i
never
saw
him
again
alive
or
dead
below
was
added
a
line
by
the
editor
this
is
an
offhand
relation
of
the
catastrophe
in
which
leighton
gillespie
lost
her
life
she
will
be
remembered
by
new
york
aristocracy
as
the
brilliant
if
eccentric
of
archibald
gillespie
the
i
returned
the
slip
to
bennett
the
excitement
of
that
wild
ride
was
upon
me
and
i
seemed
to
have
been
present
at
the
catastrophe
it
was
intended
to
avert
mountain
springs
is
in
the
west
i
judge
how
came
the
gillespies
there
and
why
was
she
the
sole
sufferer
was
he
not
on
the
train
with
her
that
is
one
of
the
peculiar
features
of
the
affair
he
was
not
on
the
train
but
he
turned
up
at
the
wreck
those
who
saw
him
there
say
that
he
worked
like
a
giant
nay
like
a
titan
amongst
those
ghastly
ruins
finally
he
found
her
she
was
quite
dead
after
that
he
worked
no
more
it
is
a
story
of
unmitigated
horror
and
the
agonies
of
that
awful
finding
might
well
leave
an
indelible
impression
on
his
brain
i
am
glad
you
recognise
this
possibility
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
even
where
no
personal
interests
are
involved
often
leaves
a
nerves
in
a
shaken
condition
for
years
besides
forgive
me
if
i
press
my
theory
beyond
all
reason
another
possibility
has
been
suggested
to
me
by
this
engineer
tale
i
will
not
broach
it
just
yet
but
inquire
first
how
leighton
gillespie
was
able
to
reach
the
scene
of
the
wreck
so
quickly
did
he
hasten
down
from
the
springs
which
seem
to
have
been
some
miles
away
or
was
he
in
the
vicinity
of
the
accident
when
it
occurred
that
is
a
question
i
have
never
heard
answered
but
i
long
ago
concluded
that
he
was
not
far
from
the
place
where
the
collision
occurred
for
he
was
seen
there
as
soon
as
the
smoke
lifted
why
what
now
you
seem
moved
excited
has
any
new
idea
been
suggested
to
you
i
exerted
myself
to
speak
calmly
but
did
not
succeed
yes
i
cried
a
strange
a
thrilling
idea
what
if
the
man
who
shared
this
engineer
awful
ride
was
leighton
gillespie
and
what
if
he
knew
through
all
that
headlong
rush
that
the
wife
he
so
much
loved
was
in
the
train
he
was
risking
his
life
to
save
from
destruction
xxv
a
summons
the
doctor
emotion
equalled
mine
it
may
have
been
so
he
admitted
there
was
always
some
unexplained
mystery
in
connection
with
his
presence
at
the
wreck
and
the
reticence
he
maintained
in
regard
to
it
if
what
you
suggest
is
true
and
he
was
the
man
who
shared
the
engineer
ride
down
those
precipitous
slopes
to
the
rescue
of
a
train
on
which
he
knew
his
wife
to
be
it
will
be
easy
enough
for
us
to
start
a
plea
of
mental
derangement
no
one
could
go
through
such
an
adventure
with
its
overpowering
excitement
and
unspeakable
suspense
without
some
injury
to
his
mental
or
physical
health
but
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
leighton
gillespie
should
have
been
wandering
on
the
that
day
instead
of
taking
the
excursion
with
his
wife
i
do
advance
this
explanation
as
a
fact
only
as
a
possibility
i
replied
the
shock
of
his
wife
sudden
death
would
be
enough
in
itself
to
change
the
man
yes
and
it
did
change
him
to
that
i
can
swear
how
long
a
time
elapsed
after
this
catastrophe
before
you
saw
him
just
two
days
he
telegraphed
for
me
and
i
went
west
to
assist
him
in
bringing
home
the
remains
of
his
young
wife
i
remember
finding
him
in
a
strained
nervous
condition
this
was
natural
enough
but
his
worst
symptoms
disappeared
after
the
funeral
do
you
mind
telling
me
where
this
funeral
took
place
in
a
small
place
up
the
hudson
river
where
the
gillespies
have
a
country
home
gillespie
carried
his
feeling
against
his
so
far
as
not
to
wish
to
have
her
buried
from
his
new
york
house
i
suppose
so
another
reason
perhaps
why
leighton
has
never
recovered
from
this
blow
and
little
claire
you
have
not
mentioned
her
was
she
with
her
parents
when
this
disastrous
event
occurred
she
was
but
an
infant
and
from
her
very
birth
was
given
into
the
charge
of
her
grandfather
she
never
knew
her
mother
it
would
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
have
learned
the
cause
of
the
determined
hostility
on
the
part
of
a
man
seemingly
so
just
as
gillespie
but
the
doctor
gave
me
no
encouragement
in
this
direction
and
i
merely
said
we
have
made
a
start
in
case
the
necessity
arises
for
proving
him
to
be
no
longer
responsible
for
his
actions
but
only
a
start
the
direction
taken
by
his
mania
is
perilously
like
the
excesses
of
a
discouraged
and
reckless
man
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
in
his
sane
mind
leighton
gillespie
is
a
great
respecter
of
the
rights
of
other
people
i
shall
look
into
this
subject
outhwaite
i
shall
look
into
it
at
once
a
talk
with
him
will
satisfy
me
whether
he
is
a
victim
of
disease
or
the
prey
of
unbridled
passions
and
murderous
instincts
the
good
doctor
rose
with
every
appearance
of
starting
forth
then
and
there
but
you
have
had
no
dinner
i
suggested
i
want
none
i
accompanied
the
doctor
out
but
parted
with
him
at
the
corner
i
would
have
given
much
for
the
privilege
of
going
with
him
to
the
gillespie
house
but
as
this
was
not
to
be
thought
of
i
resolutely
turned
towards
my
apartments
which
were
in
quite
a
different
direction
how
was
it
then
that
by
the
time
the
lights
began
to
be
lit
in
the
streets
i
found
myself
circulating
restlessly
in
the
vicinity
of
the
very
house
i
had
determined
to
avoid
had
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
day
been
too
much
for
me
it
certainly
looked
so
surely
i
had
not
wandered
hither
through
any
act
of
my
own
volition
or
for
any
definite
purpose
i
could
name
yet
now
that
i
had
been
so
led
now
that
i
was
within
sight
of
the
house
where
so
important
an
interview
was
going
on
i
surely
might
be
pardoned
for
taking
advantage
of
this
proximity
to
note
the
doctor
when
he
came
out
and
see
if
possible
from
his
manner
and
bearing
the
result
of
a
visit
upon
which
such
serious
issues
hung
it
had
threatened
storm
all
day
and
during
the
last
few
minutes
the
atmosphere
had
become
permeated
with
a
drizzle
which
made
further
tramping
over
wet
pavements
undesirable
i
therefore
looked
about
for
refuge
and
perceiving
a
building
in
process
of
construction
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
i
glided
amid
its
shadows
happy
both
at
the
protection
it
offered
and
the
full
view
it
gave
me
of
the
gillespie
front
door
that
this
was
the
act
of
one
bent
on
espionage
i
am
ready
to
acknowledge
but
it
was
espionage
undertaken
in
a
good
cause
and
for
justifiable
reasons
at
all
events
i
was
engaged
in
inwardly
persuading
myself
to
this
effect
when
an
event
occurred
which
drew
my
attention
from
myself
and
fixed
it
with
renewed
interest
on
the
door
i
was
watching
a
boy
of
whose
proximity
i
had
had
some
previous
intimation
suddenly
darted
out
from
the
space
behind
me
and
went
flying
across
the
street
to
the
gillespie
house
he
had
a
missive
in
his
hand
and
seemed
anxious
lest
he
should
be
caught
and
stopped
this
roused
my
curiosity
so
that
no
detail
of
what
followed
escaped
me
i
noted
the
furtive
way
in
which
he
thrust
the
letter
into
the
unwilling
hand
of
the
old
butler
who
answered
his
frightened
ring
at
the
bell
also
the
misgiving
shake
of
the
head
with
which
the
latter
received
it
and
the
doubtful
looks
they
both
cast
at
someone
back
in
the
hall
who
was
this
someone
and
what
lay
behind
old
agitated
demeanour
the
door
closed
on
my
curiosity
and
i
was
left
to
ponder
this
new
event
but
not
for
long
scarcely
had
my
eyes
returned
from
following
the
escaping
figure
of
the
boy
when
the
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
unclosed
again
and
bennett
came
out
now
as
i
have
taken
pains
to
say
i
had
posted
myself
there
in
order
to
note
how
this
gentleman
looked
on
leaving
leighton
gillespie
but
now
that
this
opportunity
had
come
i
not
only
failed
to
avail
myself
of
it
but
found
my
whole
attention
caught
and
my
interest
fully
absorbed
by
a
glimpse
i
had
received
of
the
latter
gentleman
standing
back
in
the
hall
reading
the
letter
i
had
just
seen
delivered
in
such
a
surreptitious
manner
his
attitude
the
gestures
he
unconsciously
made
argued
sudden
and
overwhelming
emotion
an
emotion
so
sudden
and
overwhelming
that
he
could
not
conceal
it
though
he
evidently
would
have
been
glad
to
do
so
judging
from
the
haste
with
which
he
thrust
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
turned
but
here
the
door
closed
as
frequently
happens
at
critical
moments
and
i
found
my
eyes
resting
upon
nothing
more
exciting
than
the
figure
of
the
doctor
feeling
his
way
with
due
care
down
the
damp
steps
had
i
not
been
witness
both
to
the
peculiar
actions
of
the
urchin
who
brought
this
letter
and
to
the
strange
manner
in
which
leighton
received
it
i
might
not
have
considered
it
decorous
to
make
my
presence
known
to
the
doctor
at
a
moment
and
in
a
place
so
suggestive
of
a
watch
upon
his
movements
but
as
everything
affecting
leighton
was
as
interesting
to
this
his
best
friend
as
it
was
to
me
i
crossed
the
street
and
with
scant
apology
for
the
seeming
intrusion
told
the
good
doctor
what
had
just
come
under
my
observation
he
seemed
surprised
if
not
affected
by
what
i
had
to
say
he
had
seen
no
letter
and
no
evidences
of
disorder
on
the
part
of
leighton
to
be
sure
he
had
left
before
any
letter
had
been
received
indeed
you
astonish
me
he
declared
seldom
have
i
seen
my
young
friend
in
a
more
equable
frame
of
mind
he
talked
evenly
and
with
discretion
about
the
most
exciting
subjects
and
though
i
could
wish
him
to
have
been
more
open
he
showed
a
hardly
to
be
expected
from
a
man
placed
in
such
a
disturbing
situation
the
detective
who
appeared
to
have
full
range
of
the
house
hardly
looked
our
way
once
the
letter
which
you
say
he
received
just
as
i
left
him
must
have
contained
very
agitating
news
i
wonder
if
we
will
ever
know
what
were
you
able
to
settle
in
your
own
mind
the
question
just
now
raised
between
us
at
your
office
i
asked
after
a
momentary
silence
it
may
not
be
in
order
for
me
to
ask
and
you
may
not
feel
at
all
ready
to
answer
me
if
so
do
not
hesitate
to
rebuke
my
importunity
which
springs
entirely
from
my
excessive
interest
in
the
matter
i
will
the
more
readily
excuse
you
was
his
reply
because
my
answer
must
dash
your
client
hopes
leighton
gillespie
is
not
a
victim
of
double
consciousness
if
he
were
he
would
not
remember
in
one
state
what
passes
in
the
other
now
he
does
remember
though
he
gives
no
explanation
of
what
allures
him
into
haunts
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
usual
associations
i
caught
the
glint
in
his
eye
when
i
mentioned
certain
names
leighton
can
not
deceive
me
moreover
outhwaite
i
can
not
professionally
state
that
in
my
opinion
he
is
otherwise
than
completely
sane
notwithstanding
the
tragic
experience
he
once
went
through
i
say
tragic
because
the
surmise
you
indulged
in
concerning
him
was
true
he
was
the
man
who
flung
himself
upon
the
of
that
plunging
engine
he
acknowledged
it
to
me
just
now
and
acknowledged
also
that
he
knew
that
those
cars
contained
dynamite
a
great
and
wonderful
act
for
a
man
who
had
had
no
experience
outside
the
and
the
gymnasium
i
respect
heroism
wherever
i
meet
it
said
i
slightly
lifting
my
hat
and
i
echoed
the
doctor
then
as
we
turned
down
the
street
i
do
not
comprehend
leighton
or
what
has
led
him
into
this
course
of
duplicity
if
not
crime
a
hero
at
one
period
of
his
life
a
scamp
if
not
worse
at
another
what
are
we
to
think
of
the
man
whose
nature
admits
such
contradictions
what
are
we
to
think
of
human
nature
itself
i
declare
i
am
sometimes
baffled
by
its
operations
and
heartily
wish
that
in
this
present
instance
i
could
ascribe
them
to
an
unsound
mental
condition
i
had
no
answer
for
this
ebullition
of
feeling
so
walked
on
silently
till
our
ways
divided
as
he
turned
towards
home
i
took
the
shortest
route
to
my
apartments
but
before
entering
them
i
dined
in
the
café
below
so
that
it
was
eight
at
least
before
i
mounted
to
my
rooms
a
man
was
sitting
on
the
stairs
waiting
for
me
as
i
stooped
to
unlock
my
door
he
made
known
his
errand
he
was
an
officer
in
plain
clothes
and
he
came
to
tell
me
that
i
was
wanted
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
at
the
district
attorney
office
xxvi
ferry
lights
there
could
be
but
one
reason
for
this
message
from
the
district
attorney
i
had
identified
myself
too
closely
with
the
gillespie
case
not
to
have
attracted
the
notice
of
the
police
i
was
about
to
be
called
upon
to
explain
and
while
i
shrank
from
the
task
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
myself
that
the
time
for
such
explanations
had
come
that
the
burden
then
weighing
upon
me
was
too
heavy
to
be
borne
any
longer
unassisted
but
the
explanations
i
have
thus
alluded
to
would
cost
me
hope
never
would
she
forget
through
whose
instrumentality
the
man
she
loved
had
been
betrayed
to
his
doom
it
was
now
raining
hard
and
the
chill
which
this
gave
to
the
atmosphere
was
sensibly
felt
by
us
both
as
we
stepped
out
into
the
air
at
the
suggestion
of
the
officer
accompanying
me
i
had
provided
myself
with
a
heavy
overcoat
it
stood
me
in
good
stead
that
night
much
more
so
than
i
had
any
reason
for
anticipating
when
i
donned
it
the
ride
was
hurried
and
without
incident
i
entered
the
district
attorney
office
about
nine
and
found
him
in
close
conversation
with
gryce
both
showed
relief
at
seeing
me
this
did
not
add
to
my
satisfaction
and
when
the
detective
rose
and
i
noticed
his
composed
aspect
and
the
somewhat
startling
fact
that
the
wrinkle
which
i
had
so
long
observed
between
his
brows
had
entirely
disappeared
i
experienced
a
strange
sensation
of
dread
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
delicate
nature
of
the
sympathy
which
bound
me
to
hope
meredith
for
the
moment
i
was
leighton
gillespie
conscious
of
guilt
and
quailing
under
the
quiet
eye
of
this
old
detective
this
sensation
odd
and
thrilling
as
it
was
did
not
cease
with
the
first
sight
of
this
man
it
followed
me
with
more
or
less
insistence
through
the
whole
of
this
memorable
night
occasioning
me
i
have
no
doubt
a
more
poignant
anguish
and
a
more
intolerable
share
in
the
grief
and
suspense
of
the
woman
most
affected
than
leighton
gillespie
himself
would
have
felt
or
did
feel
when
the
whole
power
of
the
law
was
brought
to
bear
upon
him
but
these
feelings
with
all
their
of
suffering
did
not
interfere
with
my
outward
composure
and
i
may
here
remark
in
passing
that
i
learned
a
lesson
from
this
experience
which
has
proved
of
great
use
to
me
in
my
profession
however
true
it
may
be
that
sudden
shock
reveals
the
hidden
motions
of
the
heart
it
is
also
true
that
a
man
if
he
is
a
man
may
be
the
victim
of
the
keenest
internal
struggle
without
abating
a
jot
of
his
natural
manner
or
showing
by
look
or
gesture
the
wild
contention
raging
within
him
this
i
have
learned
and
i
no
longer
gauge
a
man
internal
sensations
by
his
outward
appearance
the
district
attorney
was
not
slow
in
making
me
understand
what
he
wanted
of
me
after
the
necessary
civilities
had
passed
he
told
me
bluntly
that
he
had
heard
of
my
visit
to
mother
merry
and
of
the
conversation
i
had
held
there
with
a
young
woman
against
whom
a
warrant
of
arrest
had
for
some
time
been
made
out
as
by
this
interview
i
had
been
rendered
competent
to
identify
her
would
i
be
good
enough
to
accompany
the
officers
who
were
about
to
attempt
her
arrest
a
failure
in
seizing
the
right
girl
would
at
this
stage
of
the
affair
be
fatal
to
the
successful
progress
of
the
important
matter
at
present
engaging
them
what
could
i
say
my
position
at
the
best
required
explanation
and
any
hesitation
i
might
show
towards
aiding
the
police
in
their
legitimate
task
might
easily
be
construed
not
only
to
my
own
disadvantage
but
to
that
of
the
man
in
whose
behalf
i
showed
resistance
indeed
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
acquiescence
hard
and
uncongenial
as
i
found
it
i
am
at
your
service
i
returned
but
first
i
should
like
to
explain
pardon
me
interposed
the
district
attorney
explanations
will
come
later
gryce
says
he
has
no
time
to
lose
the
woman
being
a
very
restless
one
and
liable
at
any
moment
to
flit
her
name
is
or
rather
that
is
the
name
by
which
she
is
known
on
the
police
books
you
have
seen
her
and
have
only
to
follow
gryce
he
will
explain
the
rest
i
bowed
my
acquiescence
and
joined
the
old
detective
at
the
door
it
will
be
a
rough
night
that
venerable
official
remarked
with
a
keen
glance
at
my
outfit
and
with
just
this
hint
as
to
what
was
before
us
he
stepped
out
into
the
street
where
i
hastily
followed
him
we
did
not
carry
umbrellas
gryce
looking
upon
them
as
a
useless
encumbrance
and
as
i
waited
there
in
the
wet
while
my
companion
exchanged
some
words
with
a
man
who
had
stepped
up
to
him
i
marvelled
at
the
impassibility
of
this
old
man
and
the
astonishing
vigour
he
showed
in
face
of
what
most
young
and
men
would
consider
the
disadvantages
of
the
occasion
short
as
was
the
whispered
conference
it
seemed
to
infuse
fresh
life
into
the
rheumatic
limbs
i
had
frequently
seen
limping
along
in
much
more
favourable
weather
and
it
was
with
a
gesture
of
decided
satisfaction
he
now
led
the
way
to
a
cab
i
had
already
seen
dimly
outlined
through
the
mist
which
now
enveloped
everything
in
sight
we
shall
have
to
cross
the
city
he
announced
as
he
followed
me
inside
it
a
bad
night
and
gives
promise
of
being
worse
but
you
are
young
and
i
well
i
have
been
younger
but
young
or
old
have
always
managed
so
far
to
be
in
at
the
finish
it
is
the
finish
then
i
ventured
with
that
sinking
of
the
heart
leighton
might
have
felt
had
he
heard
his
own
doom
thus
foreshadowed
the
old
detective
smoothed
out
the
he
had
drawn
over
his
knees
there
is
reason
to
think
so
unless
some
mistake
or
unforeseen
misfortune
robs
us
of
success
at
the
moment
of
expected
triumph
is
your
interest
a
friendly
or
a
professional
one
the
affair
is
one
which
warrants
either
it
was
a
question
i
was
surely
entitled
to
evade
but
i
had
already
decided
to
be
frank
in
my
explanations
to
the
district
attorney
and
why
not
with
the
man
most
in
his
confidence
i
am
a
friend
of
miss
meredith
said
i
in
other
words
her
lawyer
she
is
more
than
a
friend
to
the
gillespies
as
her
relationship
demands
to
serve
her
interests
i
have
meddled
more
in
this
matter
than
was
perhaps
judicious
i
was
anxious
to
prove
to
her
that
her
cousins
lives
would
bear
scrutiny
i
see
and
discovered
that
one
of
them
at
least
would
not
poor
girl
she
has
my
sympathy
you
are
without
doubt
a
man
we
can
rely
on
no
matter
into
what
complexities
our
errand
takes
us
i
do
know
i
have
never
undergone
any
great
test
i
am
willing
to
assist
you
in
the
identification
of
this
girl
but
i
would
rather
not
be
present
at
her
arrest
we
were
crossing
broadway
he
looked
out
gave
one
rapid
glance
up
and
down
the
busy
street
busy
even
at
that
hour
and
in
the
wet
and
quietly
remarked
or
at
his
i
suppose
the
jolting
of
the
cab
over
the
struck
my
nerves
as
his
question
did
my
heart
to
this
day
i
never
cross
a
street
track
in
a
carriage
but
the
double
anguish
of
that
moment
comes
back
also
the
mist
of
lights
which
dazzled
down
the
long
perspective
as
i
cast
a
glance
through
the
dripping
windows
his
i
repeated
as
soon
as
i
could
trust
my
voice
yes
leighton
gillespie
we
expect
to
take
him
in
her
company
he
added
that
last
phrase
startled
me
you
are
going
to
take
him
in
the
presence
of
i
exclaimed
why
i
saw
him
an
hour
ago
standing
in
his
own
hall
in
fifth
avenue
no
doubt
but
if
you
have
made
a
study
of
gillespie
habits
you
have
learned
that
he
is
given
to
sudden
sallies
from
his
home
he
will
be
found
i
assure
you
in
the
same
house
as
i
hope
we
may
make
no
mistakes
in
locating
this
house
correctly
i
hardly
think
we
shall
the
men
i
have
chosen
for
the
job
are
both
keen
and
reliable
besides
for
a
gentleman
of
his
antecedents
gillespie
shows
a
startling
indifference
to
the
result
of
his
peculiar
escapades
a
strange
man
mr
outhwaite
very
i
ejaculated
abstractedly
enough
my
thoughts
were
with
a
possibility
suggested
by
his
words
pursuing
it
i
said
the
letter
i
saw
gillespie
read
was
from
her
then
i
noticed
that
it
caused
him
great
agitation
even
from
where
i
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
old
detective
smiled
instinctively
at
my
reckless
betrayal
of
the
part
i
had
played
in
this
scene
but
made
no
reference
to
the
fact
itself
possibly
because
he
was
as
well
acquainted
with
my
movements
as
i
was
myself
he
only
gave
utterance
to
an
exactly
which
seemed
not
only
to
settle
this
matter
but
some
others
then
inflaming
my
curiosity
we
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
some
such
communication
to
pass
between
them
he
presently
resumed
with
a
benevolent
condescension
springing
perhaps
from
our
close
contact
in
that
jolting
cab
otherwise
we
should
have
taken
him
and
in
his
own
house
we
have
had
great
difficulty
in
holding
the
reporters
back
and
even
in
keeping
our
own
men
quiet
it
was
desirable
you
see
to
take
them
together
and
could
she
be
found
was
she
at
mother
merry
not
lately
no
one
answering
to
her
description
has
shown
up
there
for
days
she
seems
to
have
fled
from
that
place
alarmed
no
doubt
by
the
interest
shown
in
her
by
the
young
gentleman
who
got
speech
with
her
at
the
cost
of
a
couple
of
silver
dollars
i
began
to
note
the
corners
as
we
passed
them
then
we
are
not
going
to
mother
merry
i
observed
no
we
are
not
going
to
mother
merry
yet
we
are
not
far
from
the
docks
i
remarked
as
i
caught
transitory
glimpses
of
the
unmistakable
green
and
red
lights
of
the
shining
mistily
on
the
left
no
our
errand
takes
us
in
the
region
of
her
old
haunts
i
hope
you
feel
no
concern
as
to
your
safety
concern
oh
there
cause
enough
or
would
be
if
we
were
not
in
force
but
our
preparations
have
been
made
very
carefully
and
you
can
trust
us
to
bring
you
out
all
right
i
signified
my
entire
satisfaction
the
prospect
of
physical
struggle
or
some
open
adventure
was
welcome
to
me
my
inner
excitement
would
thus
find
vent
do
not
bother
about
me
said
i
what
i
dread
most
is
the
possibility
of
meeting
that
unhappy
woman
eye
seeing
me
with
you
she
may
think
i
have
betrayed
her
and
perhaps
i
have
but
it
was
done
without
intention
she
did
not
strike
me
as
a
wicked
woman
so
much
the
less
excuse
for
the
man
who
has
made
her
his
accomplice
came
in
quiet
rejoinder
this
ended
our
conversation
for
the
time
we
were
now
making
our
way
through
upper
west
street
as
i
came
to
what
i
knew
must
be
canal
street
from
the
cars
that
went
jingling
across
our
path
the
difficulties
of
advance
became
more
marked
and
finally
the
cab
stopped
what
is
going
on
here
i
asked
as
carriage
after
carriage
rolled
into
our
course
till
the
street
was
blocked
and
we
found
it
impossible
to
proceed
it
a
cunarder
going
out
the
tide
sets
late
here
a
coach
with
a
girl
drew
up
us
i
could
see
her
happy
smile
her
air
of
busy
interest
as
she
bent
her
head
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
steamer
upon
which
she
was
perhaps
about
to
take
her
first
voyage
abroad
i
could
even
hear
her
laugh
the
sensation
was
poignant
wrapt
up
in
the
thought
of
hope
whom
i
had
not
forgotten
for
one
moment
during
this
wild
ride
the
sight
of
joy
which
might
never
again
be
hers
came
like
a
glimpse
into
another
sphere
so
far
removed
did
i
feel
from
everything
bespeaking
the
ordinary
interests
of
life
much
less
its
extraordinary
pleasures
and
anticipations
gryce
in
the
meantime
was
fuming
over
the
delay
we
might
better
have
come
up
street
he
said
ah
better
we
will
arrive
at
our
destination
now
in
less
than
ten
minutes
we
had
passed
the
cunarder
wharf
and
were
now
rolling
rapidly
northward
suddenly
the
cab
stopped
again
i
cried
gryce
replied
by
stepping
out
upon
the
sidewalk
we
alight
here
said
he
i
rapidly
followed
him
the
rain
dashing
in
my
face
blinded
me
for
a
moment
then
i
perceived
that
we
were
standing
on
a
corner
in
front
of
a
saloon
and
that
gryce
was
talking
very
earnestly
to
two
men
who
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
from
nowhere
when
he
had
finished
with
what
he
had
to
say
to
them
he
turned
to
me
sorry
sir
but
we
shall
have
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
there
are
alleys
to
explore
and
a
cab
attracts
attention
it
all
one
to
me
i
muttered
and
it
was
he
turned
east
and
i
followed
him
at
the
first
crossing
a
man
glided
into
our
wake
at
the
second
another
soon
there
were
three
men
sauntering
behind
us
at
a
convenient
distance
apart
each
held
a
policeman
club
under
his
coat
and
walked
as
if
the
rain
had
no
power
to
wet
him
suddenly
i
felt
myself
wheeled
into
an
it
was
pouring
now
and
even
the
street
lamps
shone
through
a
veil
of
mist
which
made
them
all
look
like
stars
the
alley
was
dark
for
there
were
no
lamps
there
only
at
the
remote
end
a
distant
glimmer
shone
it
came
from
the
murky
panes
of
some
shop
or
saloon
towards
this
light
we
moved
xxvii
rain
suddenly
the
figure
of
a
man
stepped
out
before
us
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
but
his
voice
had
a
familiar
sound
as
he
said
it
all
right
he
there
i
saw
him
go
in
a
ago
very
good
my
man
sweetwater
explained
gryce
turning
for
an
instant
towards
me
then
in
hurried
tones
to
the
other
do
you
know
on
which
floor
he
is
to
be
found
and
whether
the
man
at
the
bar
suspects
what
up
if
he
does
he
pretty
quiet
about
it
all
looks
natural
inside
but
you
ca
tell
what
whispers
have
gone
about
as
for
him
he
chosen
his
place
with
his
usual
indifference
to
consequences
he
in
one
of
the
attic
rooms
sir
well
back
and
can
be
reached
from
the
outside
by
means
of
a
shed
that
slopes
up
almost
to
the
if
he
wanted
to
escape
he
could
easily
do
so
by
a
drop
of
only
four
feet
but
i
have
left
a
man
on
watch
there
and
our
young
gentleman
would
fall
into
arms
that
would
let
him
go
in
a
hurry
will
you
come
around
that
way
there
a
light
in
the
window
and
there
neither
curtain
nor
shade
to
hinder
a
man
looking
in
if
you
wish
i
can
crawl
up
on
the
roof
i
spoke
of
and
take
a
peep
at
our
doves
before
we
venture
upon
disturbing
them
it
can
do
no
harm
rejoined
the
older
detective
and
if
the
girl
is
where
she
can
be
seen
this
gentleman
can
go
up
afterwards
and
identify
her
it
will
mean
surer
and
quieter
work
than
approaching
them
by
the
stairway
the
house
is
full
i
suppose
chuck
and
with
this
characteristic
word
sweetwater
melted
from
before
us
as
if
he
had
been
caught
up
in
one
of
the
swirls
of
wind
and
rain
that
ever
and
anon
swept
through
the
alley
dashing
our
faces
with
wet
and
making
our
feet
unsteady
on
the
slippery
pavement
i
began
to
feel
strange
and
unlike
myself
the
night
the
storm
the
uncongenial
place
our
more
than
uncongenial
errand
were
having
their
effect
lending
to
that
dark
entrance
into
one
of
the
worst
corners
of
our
great
city
a
sense
of
mysterious
awe
which
has
caused
it
to
remain
in
my
memory
as
something
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
experiences
of
life
it
was
not
a
long
alley
and
we
soon
reached
the
light
i
have
mentioned
we
could
hear
voices
now
loud
voices
raised
one
moment
in
contention
the
next
in
drunken
cheer
and
thrilling
through
it
all
a
woman
tones
singing
some
bewildering
melody
it
was
not
the
voice
of
i
could
never
have
mistaken
that
but
it
was
a
young
voice
and
did
not
lack
sweetness
in
the
low
notes
as
i
was
listening
to
it
something
flew
flapping
into
my
face
it
was
a
piece
of
damp
paper
peeled
from
some
billboard
by
a
wandering
gust
and
sent
scurrying
through
the
air
i
tore
it
away
from
my
eyes
drawing
a
deep
breath
like
a
person
suddenly
released
from
suffocation
but
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
effect
of
that
cold
slap
in
the
face
at
the
moment
when
my
every
nerve
was
on
tension
gryce
who
had
seen
nothing
it
was
hardly
possible
to
see
in
the
deluge
which
now
swept
down
upon
us
gave
me
a
pull
which
drew
me
from
before
the
swinging
door
i
was
unconsciously
making
for
into
a
corner
where
i
found
myself
more
or
less
shielded
from
the
wind
if
not
from
the
rain
the
alley
had
an
l
and
leading
down
from
this
l
was
a
narrow
passage
within
which
we
now
stood
surrounded
by
reeking
walls
and
facing
whenever
the
fury
of
the
storm
abated
sufficiently
for
us
to
look
up
an
opening
into
what
might
be
called
a
labyrinth
of
as
i
was
bracing
myself
to
meet
all
alarms
real
or
imaginary
associated
with
this
noisome
place
i
beheld
a
sudden
figure
emerge
from
the
opening
and
hastily
approach
us
it
was
sweetwater
again
he
had
just
descended
from
his
clamber
over
the
roofs
where
he
seemed
to
be
as
much
at
home
as
a
cat
lucky
that
it
rains
so
he
panted
keeps
the
kids
in
otherwise
some
of
us
would
have
been
spotted
long
ago
there
are
about
fifty
of
them
in
this
one
house
then
i
heard
him
whisper
in
the
ear
that
was
necessarily
very
near
mine
it
all
right
up
there
i
can
see
his
figure
plainly
he
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
window
but
there
no
mistaking
leighton
gillespie
he
in
dinner
dress
just
as
he
came
from
his
own
table
in
fifth
avenue
the
girl
well
what
of
the
girl
is
in
one
of
her
heavy
sleeps
i
could
not
see
her
face
only
her
hair
which
hung
all
about
her
i
would
know
her
hair
i
put
in
the
two
men
drew
a
step
aside
and
whispered
together
then
gryce
came
back
and
putting
his
mouth
to
my
ear
asked
if
i
had
enough
agility
to
mount
the
shed
as
sweetwater
had
done
he
says
the
wood
is
slippery
but
the
climb
up
quite
practicable
for
an
agile
man
he
had
no
difficulty
and
if
you
will
catch
hold
of
the
as
you
go
along
let
me
see
the
place
said
sweetwater
at
once
drew
me
down
the
passage
into
the
open
place
in
the
rear
here
wind
and
storm
had
their
will
again
and
for
a
moment
i
could
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
but
a
vast
expanse
of
hollow
darkness
lit
here
and
there
with
misty
lights
and
reverberating
with
all
sorts
of
sounds
among
which
the
shrieking
wind
wailed
longest
and
most
furiously
up
there
called
a
voice
in
my
ear
and
then
i
became
aware
of
an
arm
pointing
over
my
shoulder
towards
a
dark
incline
running
up
over
a
flight
of
stairs
upon
the
lower
step
of
which
i
had
almost
stumbled
that
your
road
can
you
take
it
jamming
my
hat
over
my
head
i
looked
up
a
lighted
square
met
my
eyes
in
the
blank
side
of
the
wall
against
which
this
none
too
desirable
road
as
he
called
it
ran
up
the
window
is
wide
open
said
i
as
you
see
said
he
i
shall
make
a
noise
he
will
hear
me
he
did
hear
that
no
proof
he
wo
hear
but
i
forget
the
gale
and
that
sound
what
is
it
tin
cans
rattling
loose
in
some
gutter
i
suppose
it
is
infernal
then
with
sudden
resolution
a
resolution
i
hardly
understand
for
i
certainly
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
risk
either
or
safety
in
this
cause
i
cried
out
i
try
for
it
though
it
long
since
i
put
my
agility
to
the
proof
but
how
am
i
to
get
onto
the
roof
for
reply
sweetwater
uttered
a
low
but
peculiar
call
and
a
shadow
near
by
became
a
man
lend
your
back
to
this
gentleman
said
he
and
as
i
took
advantage
of
the
assistance
thus
afforded
me
and
worked
my
way
up
onto
the
ledge
over
his
head
he
softly
added
catch
hold
of
everything
that
offers
and
be
careful
your
feet
slip
when
you
up
give
one
look
and
come
down
we
will
be
on
hand
to
catch
you
when
you
get
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
the
rain
was
dripping
from
my
hat
to
such
an
extent
that
it
nearly
blinded
me
i
tore
it
off
and
flung
it
at
their
feet
then
i
started
on
my
perilous
climb
illustration
in
two
minutes
i
was
under
that
open
window
it
was
a
difficult
one
but
not
so
difficult
as
i
had
expected
and
in
two
minutes
i
was
under
that
open
window
a
tangle
of
ropes
struck
my
head
i
suppose
laying
hold
of
them
i
steadied
myself
before
looking
in
as
i
did
so
a
consciousness
of
my
position
made
the
moment
a
bewildering
one
i
thought
of
hope
and
what
her
surprise
would
be
could
she
see
me
in
my
present
situation
on
the
peak
of
this
sloping
roof
thirty
feet
above
the
ground
hope
the
word
brought
resolution
also
i
would
look
in
upon
this
man
with
eyes
schooled
to
their
duty
but
unsharpened
by
hate
if
there
was
forbearance
due
him
i
would
try
and
exercise
that
forbearance
remembering
always
that
he
was
an
object
of
affection
to
the
woman
i
loved
was
this
why
i
for
the
first
time
saw
him
as
he
may
have
looked
to
her
and
probably
did
he
was
seated
in
such
a
way
that
only
his
profile
was
visible
beyond
the
casing
around
which
i
peered
but
that
profile
struck
me
forcibly
and
forgetting
my
errand
i
allowed
myself
a
moment
study
of
the
face
i
had
never
rightly
seen
till
then
i
was
astonished
at
the
result
astonished
at
the
effect
it
had
upon
me
leighton
gillespie
seen
with
his
brothers
was
not
the
leighton
gillespie
i
looked
upon
now
beheld
thus
by
himself
he
was
an
impressive
figure
lacking
george
height
and
alfred
regularity
of
feature
he
was
apt
to
be
regarded
by
superficial
or
prejudiced
observers
as
the
one
plain
man
in
an
exceptionally
handsome
family
but
i
saw
now
that
this
was
not
so
he
had
attractions
of
his
own
which
could
bear
comparison
with
those
of
most
other
men
and
relieved
from
too
close
comparison
with
these
two
conspicuous
personalities
the
traits
of
his
dark
melancholy
countenance
came
out
and
in
the
regard
of
his
sad
and
preoccupied
eye
was
felt
a
charm
which
might
have
ripened
into
fascination
had
no
dark
secret
beclouded
their
depths
or
interfered
with
the
natural
expression
of
feelings
that
must
once
have
been
both
natural
and
spontaneous
had
he
been
more
fortunate
in
his
tastes
or
more
able
to
put
restraint
upon
his
passions
he
might
with
that
eye
and
smile
have
been
one
of
those
men
whose
influence
baffles
the
insight
of
the
psychologist
and
from
whose
magnetic
personality
spring
innumerable
benefits
to
those
of
his
day
and
generation
all
this
was
forcibly
impressed
upon
me
as
i
knelt
in
the
pouring
rain
looking
in
upon
his
face
at
this
momentous
crisis
of
his
life
and
had
i
known
it
of
my
own
also
i
had
feared
to
advance
my
head
too
far
lest
he
should
be
attracted
by
the
movement
and
so
detect
my
presence
at
the
window
consequently
i
had
seen
as
yet
nothing
of
and
but
little
of
the
room
this
would
not
do
and
i
was
just
preparing
to
extend
my
view
further
when
the
face
i
was
watching
sank
forward
out
of
sight
and
a
groan
came
to
my
ears
so
thrilling
and
heartbroken
that
my
own
heart
stopped
beating
in
my
bewilderment
and
surprise
from
whose
lips
had
this
expression
of
anguish
sprung
from
hers
it
had
not
sounded
like
a
woman
voice
could
it
be
again
what
could
it
did
it
mean
had
leighton
gillespie
received
some
warning
of
the
fate
which
at
this
moment
hung
over
him
and
was
it
his
voice
i
heard
lifted
in
these
heartbroken
accents
i
was
willing
to
risk
everything
to
see
thrusting
my
head
forward
i
looked
boldly
into
the
room
and
momentary
as
the
glance
was
or
seemed
to
be
i
have
never
forgotten
the
dolorous
and
picture
upon
which
it
fell
by
the
light
of
a
guttering
candle
whose
blowing
flame
threatened
every
minute
to
go
out
i
saw
a
wretched
pallet
drawn
up
against
a
dirty
and
mouldering
wall
on
this
pallet
lay
a
woman
with
just
a
ragged
counterpane
covering
limbs
i
had
so
lately
seen
moving
in
rhythmical
measure
her
hair
those
bewildering
curls
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
before
seen
and
would
never
see
again
lay
about
her
wherever
those
faded
rags
failed
to
reach
it
hid
her
arms
it
framed
her
temples
and
flowing
away
coiled
in
great
masses
over
the
side
of
that
pallet
and
onto
the
floor
it
seemed
to
richen
with
its
wealth
but
it
did
not
hide
her
face
either
she
had
moved
or
her
locks
had
been
drawn
aside
since
sweetwater
crouched
in
my
place
for
now
her
features
were
plainly
visible
and
in
those
features
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
beside
her
and
drawn
up
so
close
that
the
rich
broadcloth
of
his
sleeve
brushed
the
foul
bed
and
lost
itself
among
those
overflowing
curls
sat
leighton
gillespie
with
his
head
in
his
hands
weeping
as
a
man
weeps
but
once
in
a
lifetime
there
was
no
mistaking
that
grief
real
heart
agony
can
not
be
simulated
and
touched
with
awe
for
what
i
could
not
understand
i
was
about
to
slip
away
from
my
post
when
he
gave
an
impetuous
start
roused
himself
and
glanced
in
sudden
anger
towards
a
door
set
in
the
wall
directly
opposite
me
another
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
with
his
hands
held
out
across
the
prostrate
figure
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
jealous
love
such
as
i
have
never
seen
equalled
what
had
he
seen
or
heard
the
door
was
closed
yet
he
seemed
to
fear
intrusion
whose
not
mine
for
his
eyes
did
not
turn
towards
the
window
but
remained
fixed
upon
this
door
had
the
sound
of
steps
reached
him
from
the
hall
probably
for
as
i
watched
the
door
with
him
i
beheld
the
knob
turn
then
the
door
itself
open
slowly
at
first
then
more
quickly
till
it
suddenly
fell
back
disclosing
the
quiet
form
and
composed
countenance
of
the
old
detective
i
had
left
behind
me
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
passage
at
the
side
of
the
house
at
the
same
instant
a
voice
whispered
from
over
my
shoulder
into
my
ear
lie
still
or
slip
silently
down
to
the
officers
stationed
below
you
were
so
long
that
gryce
became
impatient
up
till
then
i
had
supposed
that
only
a
moment
had
elapsed
since
i
first
looked
in
i
will
stay
i
whispered
back
i
saw
that
leighton
was
about
to
speak
who
are
you
i
heard
him
demand
of
the
intruder
in
a
passion
so
great
he
failed
to
note
the
identity
of
the
man
he
thus
accosted
i
have
a
right
to
this
room
i
have
paid
for
it
ah
he
had
just
recognised
the
detective
with
a
quick
turn
he
drew
the
coverlet
over
the
face
he
seemed
to
guard
so
jealously
then
with
an
air
of
command
which
was
at
once
solemn
and
peremptory
he
pointed
to
the
hat
which
naturally
rested
on
gryce
head
and
said
respect
for
the
dead
you
will
uncover
mr
gryce
the
dead
repeated
the
astonished
detective
striding
hurriedly
into
the
room
the
dead
is
this
girl
dead
but
his
doubt
if
doubt
it
were
disappeared
before
the
look
with
which
leighton
gillespie
regarded
him
dead
that
gentleman
declared
then
as
gryce
instinctively
bared
his
head
this
strange
this
incomprehensible
man
advanced
a
step
and
in
tones
inconceivably
touching
and
dignified
added
this
short
sentence
to
respect
her
is
to
respect
me
this
woman
is
my
wife
xxviii
by
the
light
of
a
guttering
candle
my
amazement
was
unaffected
and
so
overwhelming
i
hardly
understood
myself
his
wife
alas
then
for
hope
who
in
her
unthinking
if
generous
love
for
this
man
was
prepared
for
any
other
grief
than
this
yet
why
alas
had
she
not
told
me
that
her
greatest
wish
her
supreme
desire
was
to
see
his
character
restored
to
its
old
standing
in
her
eyes
and
had
he
not
at
this
moment
cleared
himself
of
the
one
sin
her
womanly
heart
would
find
it
hardest
to
pardon
the
cry
of
poor
hope
with
which
my
heart
was
charged
changed
to
happy
hope
and
my
composure
which
had
been
sadly
shaken
was
slowly
returning
when
the
insoluable
mystery
of
the
situation
absorbed
me
again
and
i
glanced
at
gryce
to
see
how
he
had
been
affected
by
gillespie
announcement
this
aged
detective
who
when
i
last
looked
his
way
was
standing
alone
in
the
doorway
now
had
sweetwater
at
his
side
that
agile
young
man
having
bounded
into
the
room
before
the
words
which
had
made
so
great
a
change
in
the
situation
had
fully
left
lips
and
the
contrast
of
expression
as
seen
in
the
two
faces
was
noticeable
sweetwater
young
in
experience
young
in
feeling
reflected
in
look
and
attitude
the
sensations
of
awakening
sympathy
and
interest
with
which
i
own
my
own
breast
was
full
while
the
older
detective
with
characteristic
prudence
withheld
his
judgment
and
consequently
his
sympathy
for
the
explanations
which
such
an
avowal
from
such
a
man
certainly
demanded
indeed
the
situation
might
very
naturally
suggest
to
one
so
accustomed
to
the
seamy
side
of
human
nature
that
this
sudden
demise
of
an
inconvenient
witness
chimed
in
too
opportunely
with
the
need
of
the
man
he
had
come
there
to
arrest
for
it
to
be
viewed
without
suspicion
there
was
however
only
a
tinge
of
this
feeling
in
his
voice
as
he
quietly
remarked
i
thought
you
buried
your
five
years
ago
in
cornwall
and
i
thought
so
also
was
leighton
gillespie
quiet
reply
for
many
many
wretched
weeks
and
months
i
believed
this
in
common
with
all
my
friends
then
but
it
is
a
long
story
gryce
do
you
require
me
to
relate
it
now
and
the
reverence
with
which
he
allowed
his
hand
to
touch
rather
than
fall
on
the
breast
he
had
so
carefully
covered
from
our
curious
gaze
spoke
volumes
at
the
sight
of
this
simple
action
both
men
bent
their
heads
i
doubt
if
he
noticed
it
a
stray
lock
which
had
escaped
from
the
coverlet
and
now
hung
curling
and
glittering
over
the
straw
which
protruded
from
the
wretched
pallet
had
attracted
his
eye
lifting
it
with
a
lingering
touch
he
put
it
softly
out
of
sight
then
he
quietly
said
i
would
like
to
have
one
fact
made
known
to
the
public
my
father
was
ignorant
to
the
last
that
it
was
a
stranger
and
not
my
wife
we
buried
in
cornwall
there
were
reasons
which
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
tell
him
that
gillespie
still
lived
and
while
i
make
no
excuses
for
the
silence
i
maintained
towards
him
on
this
subject
i
acknowledge
that
to
it
are
due
my
present
position
and
the
misery
i
am
now
under
of
seeing
the
darling
of
my
heart
die
in
an
attic
where
i
would
not
house
a
dog
the
accents
of
heartfelt
sorrow
are
not
to
be
mistaken
the
air
of
severity
with
which
gryce
had
hitherto
surveyed
this
supposed
criminal
softened
into
a
look
more
in
keeping
with
his
native
benevolence
but
he
had
no
reply
ready
and
the
silence
became
painful
indeed
the
situation
was
not
an
easy
one
for
even
so
experienced
a
man
as
gryce
to
handle
and
noting
his
embarrassment
i
bounded
into
the
room
and
took
my
place
at
his
side
much
as
sweetwater
had
done
gillespie
scarcely
remarked
this
new
inroad
upon
his
privacy
he
doubtless
took
me
for
another
and
as
such
not
to
be
noted
or
counted
but
the
detectives
showed
some
surprise
at
my
intrusion
which
seeing
i
turned
to
gryce
and
said
if
you
will
excuse
my
presumption
i
should
like
to
speak
to
mr
gillespie
the
latter
started
possibly
at
my
tone
and
wheeling
about
gazed
at
my
bare
head
and
drenched
figure
with
sharp
curiosity
in
which
a
growing
recognition
soon
became
visible
i
at
once
bowed
you
remember
me
i
suggested
i
am
outhwaite
if
you
will
pardon
my
method
of
entrance
and
the
proof
which
it
gives
of
my
connection
with
these
men
i
should
like
to
offer
you
my
assistance
at
this
crisis
gryce
evidently
wishes
some
conversation
with
you
which
you
rightly
hesitate
to
accord
him
in
a
place
made
sacred
by
the
presence
of
your
dead
wife
if
you
will
have
confidence
in
me
i
will
watch
this
room
while
you
go
below
no
one
shall
approach
the
bed
and
no
one
shall
enter
the
room
if
gryce
will
leave
a
guard
at
the
door
will
you
accept
this
service
it
is
sincerely
tendered
he
stood
perplexed
eyeing
me
with
mingled
doubt
and
astonishment
then
turning
with
an
inexpressible
look
of
longing
towards
the
one
object
of
his
care
he
cried
you
do
not
understand
or
you
would
not
ask
me
to
leave
her
not
for
a
moment
i
have
not
had
her
so
near
me
so
near
my
hand
so
near
my
heart
these
many
minutes
in
years
she
can
not
rise
and
run
away
from
me
now
she
does
not
even
wish
to
this
is
a
happiness
to
me
you
can
not
appreciate
a
happiness
i
can
not
endure
seeing
cut
short
leave
me
then
i
pray
and
come
again
when
she
has
been
laid
in
her
grave
you
will
find
me
ready
to
receive
you
ready
to
explain
you
ask
the
impossible
interrupted
gryce
some
explanations
will
not
bide
the
convenience
of
even
so
recent
a
mourner
as
yourself
if
you
do
not
wish
to
be
taken
immediately
from
this
place
you
will
make
some
few
things
clear
to
us
what
has
this
woman
had
to
do
with
your
father
death
nothing
the
fire
with
which
leighton
gillespie
uttered
this
word
made
us
both
start
aghast
at
what
struck
me
as
a
direct
falsehood
i
instinctively
opened
my
lips
but
gryce
made
me
an
imperceptible
gesture
and
i
refrained
from
carrying
out
my
inconsiderate
impulse
i
see
continued
the
unhappy
man
that
suspicions
which
i
had
supposed
confined
to
my
brothers
and
myself
have
involved
my
innocent
wife
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
i
will
at
once
make
known
to
you
my
miserable
story
gryce
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
as
there
was
no
other
in
the
room
we
knew
what
that
meant
the
damp
air
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
the
rheumatic
old
man
attention
being
thus
called
to
the
open
window
sweetwater
moved
over
and
closed
it
never
shall
i
forget
the
look
which
leighton
gillespie
cast
towards
the
bed
as
that
broken
and
sash
came
rattling
down
see
if
the
hall
is
clear
said
gryce
the
young
detective
crossed
to
the
door
as
he
opened
it
and
looked
out
a
gust
of
noisy
laughter
rose
from
below
mingled
with
the
shrill
sound
of
a
woman
singing
the
same
doubtless
which
we
had
previously
heard
in
front
these
tones
heard
amid
brawl
and
shouting
seemed
to
pierce
gillespie
to
the
heart
gryce
who
saw
everything
motioned
to
sweetwater
to
close
the
door
as
he
had
the
window
sweetwater
complied
by
shutting
himself
out
this
was
an
act
of
which
i
felt
called
upon
to
emulate
shall
i
join
mr
sweetwater
i
asked
it
was
gillespie
who
replied
no
i
wish
more
than
one
listener
let
the
lawyer
stay
i
was
only
too
happy
to
remain
wet
as
i
was
i
felt
anxious
to
hear
what
this
man
so
singled
out
by
hope
had
to
say
in
explanation
of
his
relations
to
the
wretched
woman
he
now
acknowledged
to
be
his
wife
he
seemed
in
haste
to
make
them
seven
years
ago
this
fall
he
began
i
met
this
woman
then
a
girl
wait
put
in
gryce
there
is
a
point
which
must
first
be
settled
and
advancing
to
the
cot
guarded
so
jealously
by
the
man
before
him
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
coverlet
you
will
allow
me
he
said
firmly
as
with
a
gentle
enough
touch
he
drew
it
softly
aside
how
came
this
woman
pardon
me
how
came
gillespie
to
die
thus
suddenly
the
unhappy
husband
after
his
first
recoil
of
outraged
feeling
forced
himself
into
a
recognition
of
the
detective
rights
and
with
apparent
resignation
rejoined
i
should
have
come
to
that
in
time
she
died
as
you
can
readily
perceive
from
exposure
driven
from
mother
merry
miserable
quarters
by
some
terror
for
which
perhaps
she
had
no
name
she
wandered
in
and
out
among
the
docks
for
two
wretched
days
and
nights
often
dragging
her
feet
through
the
ooze
of
the
river
so
that
her
garments
were
never
dry
and
are
not
so
yet
at
last
she
came
here
where
once
before
she
had
found
shelter
in
a
biting
storm
but
it
is
a
better
place
than
the
wharves
and
i
am
glad
god
guided
her
to
even
so
poor
a
refuge
she
was
raving
with
fever
when
she
came
straggling
into
the
room
below
but
after
the
warmth
struck
her
and
she
had
tasted
something
she
came
to
herself
again
and
then
and
then
she
sent
for
me
he
paused
i
did
not
yet
understand
him
or
the
circumstances
which
made
this
situation
possible
but
a
strange
reverence
began
to
mingle
with
my
wonder
not
for
the
man
i
could
not
feel
that
yet
but
for
a
love
which
could
infuse
such
feeling
into
the
lightest
allusion
he
made
to
this
beloved
if
wretched
waif
there
was
a
doctor
here
when
i
came
he
speedily
continued
you
can
find
him
he
will
tell
no
different
tale
from
mine
but
no
doctor
could
help
her
after
those
nights
of
bitter
cold
and
exposure
and
i
paid
him
to
leave
me
alone
with
her
and
she
died
in
my
arms
may
i
tell
you
why
this
was
everything
to
me
why
the
happiness
of
having
received
her
last
sigh
is
so
great
that
i
have
no
room
for
resentment
against
you
for
this
intrusion
and
hardly
feel
the
shame
of
being
found
in
this
place
with
my
dead
darling
lying
in
her
miserable
rags
on
this
hideous
pallet
you
may
tell
us
assented
gryce
replacing
the
coverlet
over
the
face
upon
which
was
fast
settling
that
look
of
peace
which
is
last
gift
to
the
living
gillespie
tone
grew
deeper
it
could
hardly
have
grown
more
tender
or
more
solemn
i
loved
this
woman
she
was
young
when
i
first
saw
her
so
was
i
there
were
no
haggard
lines
about
her
dancing
eyes
and
laughing
lips
then
she
was
a
vision
of
well
i
will
not
say
beauty
she
was
never
beautiful
but
of
i
can
not
tell
you
what
i
can
only
say
that
my
life
began
on
that
day
not
to
end
till
she
died
a
ago
i
married
her
she
was
not
a
woman
to
take
into
my
father
house
perhaps
not
into
any
family
circle
the
stage
was
her
home
the
stage
from
which
i
took
her
but
i
did
not
know
this
i
simply
knew
that
she
was
wild
in
spirit
and
unused
to
household
ways
and
social
restrictions
but
had
i
understood
her
then
as
i
do
now
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
acted
any
differently
i
was
headstrong
in
those
days
and
quite
reckless
enough
to
grasp
at
what
i
felt
to
be
my
own
even
if
aware
it
would
fall
to
nothing
in
my
frenzied
clutch
i
took
her
into
my
father
family
i
took
this
wild
bird
out
of
its
native
air
and
shut
it
up
behind
the
strict
bars
of
a
conventional
household
one
promise
only
i
exacted
from
her
as
the
price
of
this
gracious
act
on
my
part
she
was
never
under
any
pretext
not
even
in
the
event
of
my
death
to
return
to
the
stage
poor
child
she
has
kept
that
promise
perhaps
it
is
all
she
has
kept
kept
it
though
hungry
kept
it
when
the
wild
craving
for
morphine
tore
at
her
breast
and
brain
and
she
could
have
got
the
drug
for
one
strain
from
her
marvellous
voice
kept
it
though
her
veins
burned
with
longing
for
the
movement
that
was
her
life
and
the
weights
on
her
tongue
lay
heavy
on
her
heart
which
beat
truly
only
while
she
was
dancing
or
singing
it
was
her
dancing
and
singing
which
had
won
my
heart
or
rather
the
woman
when
dancing
and
singing
yet
i
cut
her
off
from
these
natural
expressions
of
the
turbulent
joy
springing
from
her
exuberant
nature
and
expected
her
to
be
satisfied
with
my
love
and
the
routine
of
a
household
this
was
my
folly
a
folly
born
of
the
delight
i
took
in
her
simple
presence
i
thought
that
she
loved
me
as
i
did
her
and
found
in
love
madness
the
recompense
for
what
she
had
laid
aside
but
i
had
not
read
her
nature
no
man
could
fill
her
heart
as
she
filled
mine
she
was
a
genius
an
untamable
one
and
the
restiveness
of
her
temperament
made
demands
which
could
only
find
relief
in
spontaneous
song
or
rhythmic
movement
my
father
who
loved
quiet
women
women
like
my
mother
whose
force
lay
hidden
in
such
sweetness
that
she
shines
with
almost
a
glory
in
our
memory
could
not
understand
my
wife
temperament
and
consequently
could
not
show
even
common
patience
towards
her
he
was
not
harsh
in
his
treatment
of
her
but
he
failed
to
give
her
credit
for
so
much
as
wishing
to
conform
to
his
ways
and
the
habits
of
the
people
she
must
meet
in
our
house
when
he
came
upon
her
stealthily
posing
before
our
long
mirror
in
the
or
caught
floating
down
the
stairs
a
faint
echo
of
her
magical
voice
in
one
of
the
tragic
strains
she
best
loved
to
sing
he
showed
such
open
shrinking
and
distaste
that
she
flew
for
comfort
to
the
one
resource
capable
of
undermining
for
me
all
hope
of
a
better
future
i
allude
to
her
use
of
morphine
she
had
taken
it
before
our
marriage
but
the
fact
was
kept
from
me
when
i
awoke
to
a
realisation
of
the
horror
menacing
my
happiness
i
devoted
time
strength
and
every
means
i
then
knew
to
win
her
from
this
practice
but
i
only
partially
succeeded
she
did
not
realise
the
harmfulness
of
this
habit
and
could
not
be
made
to
eluding
my
vigilance
she
resorted
more
and
more
to
the
drug
i
could
never
succeed
in
keeping
out
of
her
grasp
and
it
fell
to
me
to
stand
in
the
breach
thus
made
and
keep
the
knowledge
of
this
crowning
humiliation
from
my
father
and
brothers
meanwhile
my
father
who
was
strictness
itself
in
all
matters
of
propriety
insisted
upon
her
sitting
opposite
him
at
the
table
and
comporting
herself
in
every
way
as
the
lady
of
the
house
just
because
he
so
dreaded
comment
and
had
so
much
pride
in
his
own
social
standing
and
that
of
his
sons
he
kept
her
continually
on
view
and
carried
her
to
parties
and
balls
thinking
that
his
prestige
would
cause
recognition
to
be
given
her
by
his
friends
and
it
did
but
grudgingly
admired
for
what
she
was
not
she
was
scorned
for
what
she
was
i
have
seen
her
petted
by
some
society
fine
lady
till
my
blood
boiled
then
marked
the
smile
of
supercilious
sarcasm
which
would
be
thrown
back
upon
her
when
her
beautiful
shoulders
were
turned
yet
i
had
hopes
strong
hopes
of
better
days
after
the
first
strangeness
of
the
new
life
should
have
worn
away
and
her
good
impulses
had
had
time
to
develop
into
motive
powers
for
kind
actions
but
it
was
not
to
be
never
was
to
be
the
fiend
whose
power
i
had
set
myself
to
combat
was
far
stronger
than
any
force
i
could
bring
against
him
she
grew
worse
appeared
once
in
public
as
she
never
before
had
appeared
outside
her
own
room
and
my
father
who
was
with
her
never
attempted
to
hold
up
his
head
again
in
his
former
unmoved
fashion
claire
who
came
to
us
later
had
no
power
to
hold
her
mother
back
and
while
she
was
still
an
infant
the
inevitable
occurred
my
wife
ran
away
from
us
it
was
the
first
overwhelming
shock
my
hitherto
unfailing
faith
had
had
to
sustain
she
had
slipped
away
at
nightfall
without
money
and
almost
without
farewell
the
merest
note
left
on
the
piano
in
our
little
room
on
the
third
floor
told
me
she
had
tried
to
be
happy
in
a
domestic
life
but
had
failed
and
begged
me
not
to
seek
her
for
she
was
stifling
for
air
and
freedom
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
was
seeing
since
where
she
has
found
pleasure
and
under
what
conditions
the
old
gay
smile
has
revisited
her
lips
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
very
luxury
we
prized
was
oppressive
to
her
but
then
i
only
thought
of
the
dangers
and
privations
she
must
encounter
away
from
my
protection
and
confiding
to
no
one
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
me
i
rushed
from
the
house
and
sought
her
in
every
place
which
suggested
itself
to
me
as
a
possible
refuge
it
was
a
frenzied
search
and
ended
in
my
coming
upon
her
ten
days
after
her
disappearance
in
a
plain
but
decent
her
money
was
gone
and
she
lay
in
that
heavy
sleep
which
has
no
such
hallowing
effect
upon
the
beauty
as
this
we
look
upon
now
some
men
love
would
have
sickened
and
failed
them
at
this
degrading
sight
but
though
a
change
took
place
in
the
feeling
which
had
held
me
in
an
entranced
state
ever
since
my
marriage
it
was
a
change
which
deepened
rather
than
deadened
the
affection
with
which
i
regarded
her
from
a
creature
whose
untold
charm
bewitched
and
bewildered
me
she
became
to
me
a
sacred
charge
for
which
i
was
responsible
to
god
and
man
and
while
she
still
lay
there
and
i
stood
in
a
maze
of
misery
before
her
i
vowed
that
come
what
would
i
would
remain
true
to
her
and
by
means
of
this
faith
and
through
the
unfailing
patience
it
would
call
forth
make
what
effort
i
could
to
stay
her
on
the
brink
of
that
precipice
she
seemed
doomed
to
perish
by
but
i
was
to
be
tried
in
ways
i
had
little
foreseen
she
was
glad
to
see
me
when
she
woke
and
readily
consented
to
return
to
her
home
and
her
child
but
in
two
months
she
was
off
again
and
this
time
i
did
not
find
her
so
easily
when
i
did
she
was
in
such
a
hopeless
condition
of
mental
and
moral
degradation
that
i
took
her
to
a
sanitarium
where
i
had
every
reason
to
expect
that
a
proper
secrecy
would
be
maintained
as
to
her
real
complaint
and
unhappy
condition
for
my
pride
was
still
a
torment
to
me
and
an
open
rupture
with
my
father
too
undesirable
for
me
to
risk
a
revelation
of
the
true
extent
of
the
vagaries
indulged
in
by
his
unwelcome
her
escapades
serious
as
they
were
had
affected
him
but
little
for
i
had
so
closely
followed
her
in
her
sudden
flittings
that
we
were
looked
upon
as
having
left
home
together
on
some
hurried
tour
or
at
the
call
of
some
thoughtless
impulse
he
had
believed
us
out
of
town
while
i
was
engaged
in
hunting
the
city
through
for
her
but
after
a
week
spent
in
the
sanitarium
i
perceived
by
the
looks
i
encountered
on
every
side
that
my
secret
was
discovered
and
was
thus
in
a
measure
prepared
when
the
door
of
my
room
opened
one
day
upon
the
stern
figure
of
my
father
he
had
heard
the
true
cause
of
my
wife
condition
and
a
stormy
scene
was
before
me
it
was
then
that
i
regretted
that
my
early
opportunities
had
been
slighted
and
that
instead
of
being
independent
of
his
bounty
i
was
not
considered
capable
of
earning
my
own
living
had
my
home
been
one
of
my
own
making
i
might
have
stood
up
and
faced
him
at
that
hour
with
a
resolution
to
hold
by
my
wife
which
in
itself
might
have
ensured
his
respect
but
i
was
tied
hand
and
tongue
by
the
realisation
of
all
i
owed
him
was
owing
him
and
was
likely
to
owe
him
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
was
not
master
of
my
own
life
how
then
could
i
propose
to
be
the
master
of
another
my
father
whose
favourite
i
had
never
been
could
not
be
expected
to
know
what
was
passing
in
my
heart
but
he
was
not
without
a
realisation
of
what
he
might
find
in
the
adjoining
room
and
casting
a
glance
that
way
he
asked
coldly
she
gillespie
he
never
called
her
by
her
given
name
no
question
could
have
pierced
my
heart
more
poignantly
it
was
not
the
hour
for
sleep
and
the
use
of
the
word
had
intention
in
it
but
i
subdued
all
signs
of
distress
and
calling
her
by
name
bade
her
come
out
and
greet
father
after
which
i
stood
breathless
waiting
for
her
appearance
conscious
that
it
might
be
a
smiling
one
and
equally
that
it
might
be
i
dared
not
think
what
she
was
not
always
to
be
depended
upon
she
did
not
appear
at
once
down
father
i
begged
may
be
dressing
and
she
was
in
a
minute
or
two
as
we
stood
watching
she
threw
open
the
door
and
in
an
instant
i
saw
that
whatever
hope
i
may
have
cherished
of
her
creating
a
good
impression
in
her
partially
recovered
state
was
an
one
she
was
not
in
one
of
her
depressed
moods
but
what
was
worse
perhaps
in
one
of
her
ecstatic
ones
all
her
genius
and
she
had
much
had
taken
fire
under
some
impulse
of
her
erratic
brain
and
she
came
into
the
room
prepared
to
conquer
in
the
only
way
she
knew
how
still
young
still
beautiful
in
her
own
way
which
was
that
of
no
other
woman
she
glided
into
our
presence
in
one
rapturous
whirl
a
scarf
floating
from
her
neck
and
a
wreath
of
wild
vine
about
her
head
i
rushed
to
prevent
her
but
it
was
too
late
she
dance
and
she
did
while
my
father
who
had
never
seen
her
in
this
glowing
state
drew
me
aside
and
watched
with
hard
eyes
while
she
swayed
and
dipped
and
palpitated
in
what
would
have
been
a
glorious
ebullition
of
pure
delight
had
she
not
been
my
wife
and
the
man
at
my
side
as
cold
to
her
charm
as
the
dew
which
stood
out
on
my
wretched
forehead
when
i
could
bear
no
more
i
flung
my
arms
about
her
and
she
stopped
panting
and
frightened
like
a
bird
caught
in
full
flight
i
whispered
to
her
that
air
from
i
thought
the
tragic
pathos
of
her
tones
might
make
her
dancing
forgotten
and
they
did
in
a
way
my
father
had
never
listened
to
any
such
dramatic
rendering
of
a
simple
song
before
and
i
saw
that
he
was
subdued
by
the
feelings
it
awakened
but
i
gathered
no
hope
from
this
he
had
too
little
liking
for
public
exhibitions
of
this
kind
on
the
part
of
women
for
him
to
be
affected
long
by
any
singing
which
was
not
that
of
the
boudoir
and
when
her
first
ebullition
passed
she
began
to
droop
under
the
heavy
reaction
which
inevitably
followed
these
impulsive
performances
i
drew
her
into
the
other
room
and
shut
the
door
then
i
came
back
and
faced
him
he
was
standing
in
the
window
of
the
large
but
unlovely
room
drumming
restlessly
on
the
panes
before
him
as
the
light
struck
his
head
it
brought
to
view
the
silver
rapidly
making
its
way
through
the
dark
locks
he
had
been
accustomed
to
pride
himself
upon
and
a
pang
struck
me
at
this
sight
which
made
me
quite
dumb
for
the
instant
i
felt
as
if
i
and
not
she
had
been
dancing
over
his
heart
then
my
thought
of
the
woman
i
had
sworn
to
cherish
returned
and
held
me
steady
while
he
said
is
well
that
i
have
seen
your
wife
once
when
the
full
spell
was
upon
her
now
i
know
what
has
come
into
the
gillespie
family
leighton
do
you
love
this
woman
illustration
she
glided
into
our
presence
in
one
rapturous
whirl
to
bear
your
condemnation
if
you
choose
to
condemn
us
i
assured
him
take
her
away
out
of
my
sight
and
from
the
possible
sight
of
my
growing
grandchild
a
dancing
menad
can
be
no
mother
to
claire
will
take
her
away
i
promised
him
this
place
has
done
all
for
her
it
can
i
will
carry
her
where
she
can
offend
no
one
but
strangers
would
suggest
an
asylum
he
muttered
it
was
the
only
unjust
thing
i
ever
knew
him
to
propose
is
not
insane
i
objected
is
not
sane
he
rejoined
is
but
i
will
not
force
your
conscience
only
let
me
never
again
see
her
in
our
home
in
fifth
avenue
will
always
be
welcome
i
could
not
retort
that
i
would
enter
no
house
from
which
she
was
thus
peremptorily
excluded
the
house
in
fifth
avenue
was
my
home
the
home
of
my
child
and
about
it
clustered
every
dear
association
of
my
heart
save
those
connected
with
my
unhappy
love
man
who
marries
for
a
whim
must
expect
unpleasant
results
my
father
resumed
shall
have
what
money
you
need
for
her
establishment
elsewhere
but
this
hemisphere
is
too
narrow
to
harbour
both
her
and
myself
go
to
europe
leighton
there
is
more
room
there
for
your
wife
to
dance
in
and
i
meant
to
follow
this
suggestion
but
her
health
was
not
good
enough
for
me
to
risk
a
voyage
at
this
juncture
and
we
drifted
west
and
put
up
at
a
place
called
mountain
springs
it
was
during
our
stay
there
that
so
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
the
story
of
my
married
life
ended
but
for
me
it
had
only
begun
the
facts
regarding
my
wife
and
her
connection
with
that
great
catastrophe
which
robbed
more
than
one
household
of
wife
and
mother
differed
much
in
reality
from
those
reported
to
the
world
and
accepted
by
my
own
family
she
did
not
perish
in
that
wreck
though
i
thought
she
had
and
mourned
her
loss
for
many
months
she
had
merely
taken
advantage
of
the
circumstances
to
effect
another
escape
how
i
will
endeavour
to
relate
hard
as
it
is
to
disclose
the
failings
of
one
so
dear
to
me
my
wife
whose
natural
longings
had
been
modified
rather
than
extinguished
by
her
experiences
at
the
sanitarium
soon
awakened
to
the
old
sense
of
restraint
and
a
desire
to
enjoy
again
the
irresponsibilities
of
her
early
bohemian
life
but
having
gained
wisdom
by
her
past
experiences
she
allowed
no
expression
of
her
feelings
to
escape
her
and
relying
on
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
her
apparent
content
merely
asked
the
privilege
of
enjoying
the
sports
indulged
in
by
the
other
boarders
fearing
to
cross
her
too
much
i
gave
her
all
possible
liberty
but
when
she
begged
to
go
on
a
certain
excursion
the
excursion
which
ended
so
disastrously
for
all
concerned
i
felt
forced
to
refuse
her
for
i
had
made
an
arrangement
that
day
which
would
prevent
me
from
accompanying
her
however
after
repeated
solicitation
i
yielded
to
her
importunities
and
gave
her
my
consent
at
which
she
showed
much
joy
and
lavished
many
expressions
of
fondness
upon
me
had
my
suspicions
not
been
lulled
by
the
undisturbed
peacefulness
of
the
last
few
months
these
open
demonstrations
of
affection
might
have
occasioned
me
some
alarm
for
they
were
not
without
a
suggestion
of
remorse
but
i
mistrusted
nothing
i
was
too
happy
and
when
i
parted
from
her
it
was
with
the
full
intention
of
sacrificing
for
her
pleasure
the
first
real
business
engagement
i
had
ever
entered
upon
but
i
did
not
carry
out
this
impulse
i
merely
made
arrangements
for
the
train
to
stop
for
me
at
the
little
station
on
the
mountains
where
my
affairs
led
me
but
i
did
not
confide
this
plan
to
her
till
i
was
upon
the
point
of
leaving
then
i
told
her
she
might
look
for
me
on
the
train
immediately
after
passing
buckley
and
while
i
wondered
at
the
way
she
received
my
words
i
thought
the
embarrassment
she
showed
was
due
to
surprise
alas
it
sprang
from
much
deeper
sources
she
had
planned
to
leave
me
again
this
time
forever
and
baffled
as
she
thought
in
the
attempt
she
succumbed
for
a
little
while
to
despair
then
her
fertile
brain
suggested
an
expedient
two
trains
left
mountain
springs
that
morning
one
north
and
one
south
she
would
take
the
southern
train
and
lest
she
should
be
prematurely
discovered
in
her
flight
and
so
be
followed
before
she
had
found
a
refuge
she
prevailed
upon
a
girl
over
whom
she
had
some
influence
to
exchange
garments
with
her
and
take
her
place
among
the
excursionists
she
little
dreamed
what
lay
before
those
excursionists
as
little
did
i
realise
that
it
was
in
behalf
of
a
stranger
i
entered
upon
that
mad
chase
after
the
runaway
cars
i
had
seen
slip
from
the
engine
and
go
crashing
down
towards
the
train
on
which
i
believed
my
wife
to
be
i
knew
those
cars
to
be
loaded
with
dynamite
for
it
was
in
connection
with
this
fact
i
had
come
to
this
place
and
the
thought
that
they
were
destined
to
prove
the
destruction
of
the
life
i
so
much
prized
maddened
me
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
instinct
for
me
to
leap
upon
the
engine
i
saw
bounding
to
her
rescue
had
time
been
given
me
to
think
i
might
not
have
shown
such
temerity
for
i
knew
nothing
of
a
fireman
duties
or
what
would
be
expected
of
me
by
the
engineer
but
i
did
not
pause
to
think
i
only
stood
ready
to
hazard
my
life
for
the
woman
i
loved
the
woman
whom
i
believed
to
be
on
the
train
i
even
then
could
see
advancing
up
the
valley
of
that
ride
its
swirl
and
whirlwind
rush
i
remember
little
every
thought
every
fear
was
engrossed
in
the
one
question
how
were
we
to
save
that
train
but
two
methods
suggested
themselves
to
me
in
my
ignorance
and
isolation
from
the
brave
engineer
either
we
must
overtake
the
cars
and
by
coupling
to
them
stay
their
downward
rush
to
the
main
track
below
a
trick
i
did
not
understand
or
we
must
crush
so
fiercely
into
them
as
to
explode
the
dynamite
with
which
they
were
loaded
before
they
had
a
chance
to
collide
with
the
advancing
train
that
the
latter
catastrophe
did
not
happen
was
not
owing
to
any
precaution
on
my
part
for
i
do
not
remember
that
i
had
the
least
dread
of
personal
destruction
as
i
have
just
said
my
one
thought
my
only
thought
in
that
dizzy
descent
was
to
save
her
and
i
failed
to
do
it
or
so
i
had
reason
to
think
as
you
remember
all
our
efforts
were
in
vain
the
unspeakable
occurred
and
wreck
death
and
disaster
met
my
eyes
when
after
a
period
of
blank
darkness
i
rose
from
the
ground
where
i
had
been
hurled
by
the
force
of
that
dynamite
explosion
amid
this
wreck
in
face
of
this
death
i
plunged
in
my
search
for
her
and
as
i
believed
found
her
a
loving
husband
can
not
be
deceived
in
his
wife
clothes
and
the
fragments
i
handled
told
their
tale
as
i
thought
only
too
well
but
as
you
now
know
it
was
not
my
wife
who
wore
these
clothes
though
we
buried
her
as
such
and
i
mourned
my
lost
love
as
no
one
who
has
not
fixed
his
whole
heart
upon
one
object
can
possibly
understand
my
father
whose
relief
at
this
release
can
be
readily
imagined
endeavoured
to
calm
my
grief
not
by
sympathy
for
that
he
could
not
feel
but
by
an
unvarying
kindness
which
assured
me
that
now
that
this
obstacle
to
a
right
understanding
between
us
had
been
removed
i
might
hope
for
the
establishment
of
more
cordial
relations
between
us
i
was
older
now
and
he
more
considerate
of
my
many
uncongenial
ways
and
habits
besides
claire
made
a
tender
bond
between
us
and
with
one
of
her
baby
smiles
healed
many
a
breach
that
might
otherwise
have
separated
us
i
began
to
be
content
when
having
some
business
in
a
strange
quarter
of
the
city
i
chanced
to
walk
down
east
fourteenth
street
it
was
a
holiday
of
some
kind
and
there
had
been
a
procession
the
stir
in
the
streets
was
just
what
usually
follows
the
breaking
up
of
long
lines
of
people
but
this
did
not
disturb
me
claire
had
been
unusually
engaging
that
morning
and
i
was
just
rejoicing
in
the
memory
of
her
innocent
prattle
when
the
band
in
the
far
distance
broke
out
into
a
merry
strain
and
i
saw
on
the
sidewalk
before
me
a
cluster
of
people
separate
into
a
sort
of
ring
in
the
middle
of
which
a
woman
stood
poised
with
swaying
arms
so
like
the
image
that
was
day
by
day
receding
farther
and
farther
into
the
deep
recesses
of
my
memory
that
a
species
of
faintness
came
over
me
and
i
drew
back
sick
and
directly
in
the
path
of
the
people
pressing
in
my
rear
this
caused
me
to
receive
a
push
from
behind
which
effectually
roused
me
and
gave
me
strength
to
look
again
at
one
who
could
recall
my
lost
i
expected
how
could
i
expect
anything
else
to
be
met
by
a
strange
face
and
an
unknown
smile
but
it
was
face
smile
and
the
figure
clad
in
such
clothes
as
i
had
never
even
in
my
worst
dreams
associated
with
the
woman
to
whom
i
had
given
my
name
was
had
god
made
two
such
women
two
with
such
eyes
such
hair
such
instincts
and
such
genius
was
this
a
sister
of
a
twin
of
my
lost
darling
of
whose
existence
i
had
never
heard
god
grant
not
i
had
buried
and
with
her
memories
which
this
creature
would
only
bring
back
to
the
destruction
of
my
peace
i
dared
not
give
way
for
one
instant
to
the
thought
that
this
likeness
was
anything
but
a
passing
illusion
which
the
next
moment
would
dispel
i
dared
not
for
my
life
and
yet
i
stood
staring
hearing
and
not
hearing
the
shouts
of
wild
applause
rising
around
me
and
was
looking
yes
looking
directly
into
her
eyes
when
they
suddenly
turned
my
way
in
startled
recognition
it
was
the
woman
i
had
buried
was
a
stranger
and
she
who
was
making
pastime
for
the
passing
crowd
was
i
made
no
scene
i
accepted
the
fact
as
we
accept
any
unforeseen
catastrophe
that
comes
upon
us
unawares
tearing
up
our
peaceful
present
and
making
a
chaos
of
the
future
as
she
was
still
dancing
though
fitfully
and
with
curious
breaks
i
stopped
her
by
my
steady
look
and
held
her
so
till
the
crowd
had
melted
away
sufficiently
for
me
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
lead
her
under
the
cover
of
the
first
small
shop
we
came
to
then
i
questioned
her
closely
and
when
i
understood
all
asked
her
if
she
would
go
with
me
and
be
clothed
and
fed
she
answered
with
a
startled
look
can
not
she
cried
and
wearily
drooped
her
head
am
not
worthy
god
knows
what
passed
through
my
mind
then
i
stood
there
in
the
wretchedness
of
this
low
shop
beside
a
counter
from
which
the
smell
of
stale
tobacco
rose
in
nauseous
fumes
together
with
the
sickening
smell
of
partially
decayed
fruits
a
flower
in
my
put
there
by
little
claire
and
before
me
this
woman
loved
as
few
of
earth
best
and
worthiest
have
been
telling
me
with
trembling
lips
what
explained
her
rags
the
degradation
which
had
fallen
on
her
beauty
and
the
whole
pitiable
downfall
of
a
womanhood
which
once
struck
my
heart
as
ideal
and
worthy
of
a
man
unselfish
worship
drawing
the
flower
from
my
i
crushed
it
in
my
hand
if
i
could
have
donned
the
clothes
of
some
of
the
men
lolling
about
us
in
greedy
curiosity
i
would
have
done
so
at
that
moment
if
only
the
contrast
between
our
outer
selves
might
have
been
less
apparent
but
this
was
impossible
and
i
could
only
stand
in
silence
in
face
of
this
wreck
of
bygone
delights
and
in
one
moment
and
under
the
gaze
of
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
peering
from
behind
the
counter
and
gaping
in
at
the
doorway
live
down
my
bitter
humiliation
at
this
untoward
resurrection
of
a
love
i
had
learned
to
rejoice
in
as
buried
for
this
was
no
wretched
waif
of
the
streets
i
could
pity
and
leave
this
was
my
wife
the
mother
of
my
child
the
woman
whom
i
had
once
vowed
to
hold
in
honour
to
the
end
and
to
succour
no
matter
what
her
need
or
to
what
degradation
she
might
come
besides
there
was
an
appeal
in
her
drooping
attitude
and
quivering
mouth
which
touched
my
heart
in
spite
of
my
judgment
i
felt
her
misery
as
i
had
never
felt
my
own
a
misery
all
the
more
pronounced
because
of
the
joy
so
openly
preceding
it
and
feeling
a
fresh
thrill
in
the
old
cord
of
union
that
had
made
our
hearts
one
i
quietly
asked
her
if
she
had
lost
all
love
for
me
she
gave
me
one
quick
look
and
i
saw
her
eye
quicken
as
she
softly
faltered
only
she
made
haste
to
add
can
not
live
in
big
houses
under
the
eyes
of
people
who
think
my
ways
odd
and
wrong
if
you
take
me
back
to
him
i
can
not
help
going
wrong
again
but
i
would
like
something
pretty
to
wear
and
something
good
to
eat
i
took
her
to
an
east
side
hotel
i
bought
her
clothes
and
gave
her
food
over
which
she
laughed
like
a
child
then
i
told
her
what
i
meant
to
do
for
her
i
would
buy
her
a
home
in
a
pretty
country
place
where
she
need
not
fear
intruding
eyes
there
she
should
live
with
some
woman
i
could
trust
and
who
would
be
kind
to
her
a
piano
music
flowers
books
she
should
have
all
and
if
in
the
course
of
time
she
came
to
wish
it
i
would
bring
our
child
to
see
her
did
she
think
she
could
be
contented
in
a
home
like
this
would
it
be
better
than
the
cold
and
squalor
of
the
streets
and
these
wild
dances
before
unsympathetic
eyes
she
answered
with
a
burst
of
affection
which
was
real
enough
at
the
time
then
asked
if
i
was
going
to
let
my
father
know
she
was
living
this
brought
to
light
the
spectre
which
had
stood
over
against
us
ever
since
i
first
recognised
her
as
the
woman
i
had
sworn
to
love
and
cherish
could
i
tell
my
father
could
i
bring
down
again
upon
myself
the
old
coldness
the
old
distrust
the
old
sense
of
a
division
that
was
gall
to
me
because
of
the
reverence
and
love
i
naturally
felt
for
him
i
could
not
i
recognised
the
cowardice
of
it
but
i
could
not
i
was
ready
to
give
her
succour
i
was
ready
to
devote
time
money
and
care
to
her
establishment
and
i
could
deny
myself
the
pleasures
and
pursuits
natural
to
men
of
my
age
and
even
the
uninterrupted
enjoyment
of
the
home
i
had
come
to
prize
but
i
could
not
tell
my
father
that
the
creature
he
was
forcing
himself
to
forget
still
lived
and
might
any
day
bring
down
fresh
humiliation
upon
him
she
saw
my
doubt
and
smiled
as
in
the
early
days
of
her
untrammelled
youth
so
she
cried
if
i
fail
to
be
good
it
will
not
so
much
matter
and
i
may
fail
it
is
in
my
blood
leighton
in
my
unfortunate
bohemian
blood
oh
why
did
you
ever
care
for
me
such
gusts
of
feeling
and
regret
over
the
havoc
she
had
caused
were
common
to
her
they
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
hope
in
her
ultimate
restoration
to
respectability
and
a
quiet
life
but
alas
they
were
but
gusts
and
after
a
few
months
of
peaceful
harbourage
in
the
cottage
i
found
for
her
she
fled
from
me
again
and
was
lost
for
but
i
never
ceased
searching
for
her
the
unrest
of
knowing
she
was
restless
under
the
roof
i
had
provided
for
her
was
nothing
to
the
restlessness
of
not
knowing
where
she
was
and
in
what
misery
and
under
what
deprivation
she
was
pining
away
in
the
dark
holes
where
alone
she
could
find
refuge
i
have
sat
hours
under
my
father
eye
talking
of
stocks
and
bonds
and
railway
shares
while
my
every
thought
and
feeling
were
with
her
whom
in
my
fancy
i
saw
wandering
from
river
to
river
in
dark
nights
and
in
cold
rain
on
the
pavements
or
slush
in
the
streets
drawing
up
to
lighted
doors
for
warmth
or
hiding
her
brown
head
with
its
flying
curls
under
sheds
a
dog
might
be
glad
to
fly
from
it
has
happened
to
me
often
to
be
in
the
presence
of
women
at
church
or
concert
or
festival
and
with
their
eyes
on
my
face
and
the
perfume
of
their
presence
floating
about
me
to
behold
in
my
perspective
a
solitary
figure
poised
on
the
edge
of
some
dock
in
whose
lifted
arms
and
upstrained
countenance
i
read
despair
the
despair
that
leads
to
death
and
forgetting
where
i
was
and
to
whom
my
words
were
due
have
rushed
out
to
do
what
wander
those
streets
and
the
bleak
places
i
had
seen
in
my
fancy
in
the
hope
of
coming
once
again
upon
the
being
who
unaccountably
to
myself
still
held
the
cord
whose
other
end
was
bound
indissolubly
to
my
heart
what
wonder
that
i
was
looked
upon
as
eccentric
moody
strange
or
that
my
father
who
naturally
explained
these
freaks
according
to
his
own
lights
showed
displeasure
at
my
unaccountable
whims
yet
i
went
on
with
my
search
and
finally
the
day
arrived
when
my
perseverance
was
rewarded
and
i
came
upon
her
once
again
she
was
in
a
low
but
she
was
not
dancing
she
was
simply
gazing
at
another
woman
attempting
those
dizzy
whirls
which
under
the
sway
of
her
own
genius
had
once
attracted
the
applause
of
a
different
crowd
from
this
there
was
infinite
longing
in
her
eyes
mixed
with
the
sadness
which
will
sometimes
creep
over
those
who
are
homeless
through
their
own
choice
when
she
saw
me
and
this
was
perhaps
sooner
than
was
best
for
either
herself
or
me
i
saw
the
old
look
of
terror
rise
in
her
eyes
but
mingled
with
it
was
a
certain
recognition
of
my
faithfulness
and
care
for
her
which
melted
the
ice
about
my
heart
and
reawakened
the
old
hope
for
her
but
she
did
not
follow
me
when
i
beckoned
her
out
nor
could
i
induce
her
to
do
so
without
risking
a
scene
which
would
necessarily
attract
all
eyes
to
us
but
she
promised
if
i
gave
her
money
to
return
the
next
day
to
the
little
house
in
new
jersey
and
she
did
but
her
stay
was
short
and
it
became
a
common
thing
for
her
to
drift
back
there
for
a
day
or
so
and
then
to
flee
away
again
to
return
when
the
fancy
seized
her
or
the
devils
of
discomfort
drove
her
to
seek
a
respite
from
the
horrors
which
had
now
become
for
her
synonymous
with
freedom
she
always
found
something
to
reward
her
for
these
visits
some
surprise
in
the
shape
of
a
new
article
or
some
fresh
source
of
amusement
money
to
me
was
only
valuable
as
it
gave
me
power
to
rivet
another
link
to
the
chain
with
which
i
endeavoured
to
hold
her
to
a
better
life
and
though
i
knew
the
false
construction
which
might
be
put
upon
these
expenditures
not
only
by
my
father
but
others
i
spared
no
means
stopped
at
no
extravagance
which
might
add
one
more
allurement
to
the
nest
i
had
made
for
my
weary
and
bedraggled
one
the
woman
who
had
orders
to
keep
this
house
in
a
continual
state
of
readiness
for
its
fitful
visitant
was
as
discreet
as
she
was
sympathetic
she
may
have
surmised
my
secret
or
she
may
have
supposed
all
these
efforts
the
result
of
an
philanthropy
i
could
never
tell
by
her
manner
but
i
knew
she
treated
my
poor
one
well
time
after
time
has
she
opened
the
door
to
a
disordered
and
dishevelled
creature
whom
next
morning
i
found
sitting
in
a
bower
of
roses
fitted
out
in
dainty
cashmeres
and
with
her
long
locks
combed
till
they
shone
and
shone
again
nay
i
have
come
upon
her
on
her
knees
before
the
bruised
and
frozen
feet
upon
which
she
was
thrusting
slippers
of
downy
softness
which
made
my
darling
laugh
until
their
very
softness
became
a
burden
and
she
threw
them
off
to
dance
i
have
never
lingered
over
these
sights
but
i
have
imagined
them
over
and
over
with
eyes
for
explain
it
as
you
will
every
backward
slip
made
by
my
darling
toward
the
precipice
i
ever
saw
yawning
for
her
strengthened
the
hold
she
had
upon
my
heart
till
the
pity
with
which
i
regarded
her
filled
my
whole
bosom
to
bursting
but
the
wild
hawk
can
not
be
tamed
she
would
vanish
from
our
care
just
when
we
thought
it
was
becoming
dear
to
her
and
my
wild
pursuit
would
begin
again
to
be
followed
by
chance
findings
and
renewed
disappointments
she
was
not
to
be
held
though
in
the
hope
of
doing
so
i
have
spent
many
stolen
hours
in
the
little
house
reading
to
her
talking
to
her
playing
with
her
sacrificing
my
good
name
and
the
regard
of
my
relatives
just
to
win
back
one
innocent
look
to
her
face
and
keep
her
amused
and
contented
without
the
help
of
the
accursed
drug
she
slipped
away
from
us
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
and
during
this
last
year
returned
only
once
yet
i
think
she
has
felt
more
drawn
to
me
this
year
than
in
all
the
time
of
our
marriage
but
she
felt
her
unworthiness
more
she
had
listened
to
the
hymns
sung
by
the
salvation
army
on
some
of
the
corners
and
being
susceptible
to
impressions
of
this
nature
had
followed
the
singers
into
their
halls
and
heard
some
of
the
good
words
that
are
uttered
there
sometimes
i
am
told
she
laughed
at
what
she
heard
but
oftener
was
seen
to
cry
and
once
she
herself
sang
till
as
they
said
the
very
heavens
seemed
to
open
when
i
heard
this
i
could
not
keep
away
from
these
meetings
though
i
never
came
upon
her
at
any
one
of
them
either
on
the
east
or
west
side
she
seemed
to
anticipate
my
approach
there
as
elsewhere
for
often
have
i
been
assured
that
she
had
just
that
minute
gone
out
and
must
be
somewhere
near
though
i
never
succeeded
in
finding
her
this
looked
to
me
then
like
hate
but
now
i
think
it
was
simply
shame
for
when
she
knew
that
death
was
upon
her
she
sent
for
me
and
seeing
the
old
look
of
forbearance
on
my
face
she
threw
up
her
wasted
arms
and
panting
like
a
child
who
has
reached
its
mother
arms
at
last
turned
her
tired
tired
face
towards
my
breast
with
a
feeble
and
died
you
can
not
know
the
heart
of
a
man
who
has
followed
his
lost
lamb
for
years
through
tangled
thickets
and
by
headlong
precipices
and
it
may
seem
strange
for
me
to
pour
into
ears
so
hardened
and
necessarily
so
unsympathetic
the
sacred
secrets
of
my
soul
but
my
position
is
a
strange
one
and
my
story
one
that
must
be
told
in
its
entirety
for
you
to
understand
why
that
smile
upon
her
face
is
so
much
to
me
that
my
sole
prayer
at
this
time
is
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
sight
of
it
for
one
hour
she
has
loved
me
always
not
as
i
loved
her
not
to
the
point
of
saving
me
one
heartache
or
sparing
me
one
erratic
impulse
of
her
ungoverned
nature
but
still
better
than
i
feared
better
than
her
conduct
would
show
for
when
i
came
to
lay
her
head
down
again
upon
its
pillow
i
found
tied
about
her
neck
and
fast
clutched
in
her
chilling
palm
our
wedding
ring
he
murmured
she
might
have
pawned
it
for
a
dollar
during
any
of
the
many
crises
of
her
miserable
life
he
paused
put
the
token
back
in
his
breast
and
added
but
one
more
word
when
she
was
alive
and
well
with
vigour
in
her
dancing
foot
and
a
deathless
unrest
in
her
gypsy
heart
she
chafed
at
my
presence
and
fled
from
my
protection
but
when
the
final
shadow
settled
and
she
felt
all
other
props
give
way
then
her
poor
arms
rose
in
recognition
of
the
love
which
had
never
failed
her
there
was
an
indescribable
tone
of
triumph
in
his
tones
she
had
need
of
me
in
her
dying
hours
she
smiled
he
paused
and
his
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
on
her
form
rose
instinctively
not
to
the
dingy
rafters
overhead
but
to
the
heaven
he
saw
above
those
rafters
for
him
her
spirit
had
fled
upward
whatever
we
might
think
of
her
to
him
she
was
henceforth
a
being
blessed
and
gathered
into
a
refuge
from
which
she
would
nevermore
seek
or
wish
to
escape
it
was
hard
to
break
into
this
calm
hopefulness
with
words
of
stern
or
sinister
meaning
but
gryce
had
no
choice
what
then
is
your
special
desire
asked
that
officer
gillespie
eyes
fell
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
thinking
then
he
said
i
have
retribution
to
make
to
her
memory
i
wish
to
take
her
to
my
own
house
and
bury
her
from
there
as
my
wife
the
humiliation
from
which
my
pride
recoiled
in
the
old
days
has
been
meted
out
to
me
i
no
longer
wish
to
evade
my
responsibilities
his
expression
as
he
said
this
was
very
different
from
the
smile
i
had
surprised
on
his
face
the
night
he
stooped
over
his
dead
father
yet
the
one
brought
up
the
other
and
in
a
measure
acted
as
a
mutual
interpretation
by
means
of
it
and
the
determination
he
had
just
expressed
i
could
comprehend
the
feeling
of
that
moment
when
with
police
in
the
house
and
the
whole
family
subjected
to
a
suspicion
which
involved
it
in
the
utmost
disgrace
he
contemplated
the
features
of
the
man
whose
pride
found
the
hemisphere
in
which
he
lived
too
small
to
hold
both
himself
and
the
daughter
whose
worst
fault
was
a
proclivity
to
dance
and
sing
gryce
who
had
no
such
memories
to
reconcile
was
meanwhile
surveying
the
young
man
with
a
curious
hesitation
i
regret
said
he
the
presence
of
an
obstacle
to
your
very
natural
wish
to
bury
your
wife
from
your
own
house
gillespie
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
we
are
not
here
on
a
simple
errand
of
surveillance
my
orders
were
to
arrest
you
on
the
charge
of
murdering
your
father
xxix
the
quiet
hour
i
would
rather
have
been
spared
the
pain
of
that
moment
gryce
had
virtually
promised
that
i
should
not
be
present
at
arrest
but
i
presume
he
forgot
not
only
his
promise
but
my
very
existence
in
the
unexpected
interest
of
this
extraordinary
situation
gillespie
who
at
another
time
might
have
succumbed
to
the
emotion
of
seeing
himself
singled
out
from
his
brothers
on
the
charge
which
had
hitherto
involved
them
all
was
already
in
a
state
of
too
much
agitation
to
make
much
demonstration
over
this
fresh
humiliation
nevertheless
it
became
evident
from
the
droop
of
his
arms
and
the
general
air
of
discouragement
which
crept
into
his
whole
bearing
that
the
iron
had
entered
his
soul
and
the
climax
of
his
many
woes
had
been
reached
i
hoped
for
other
results
when
i
entered
upon
my
long
and
painful
story
he
remarked
certainly
you
have
found
me
able
to
account
for
much
that
has
seemed
anomalous
in
my
relations
to
my
father
and
the
attitude
i
have
been
compelled
to
preserve
towards
society
i
am
surprised
that
anyone
should
continue
to
regard
me
as
having
had
anything
to
do
with
my
father
unhappy
death
may
i
ask
what
special
evidence
you
imagine
yourselves
to
have
against
me
i
may
be
able
to
refute
it
with
a
word
this
was
more
than
gryce
could
grant
and
he
said
so
though
with
less
imperturbability
of
manner
than
usual
i
am
under
orders
to
bring
you
into
the
presence
of
the
district
attorney
he
explained
who
will
use
his
own
discretion
in
the
matter
of
having
you
detained
will
you
accompany
me
quietly
leaving
the
care
of
your
wife
to
outhwaite
who
i
am
sure
will
follow
your
wishes
in
the
choice
of
such
assistants
as
he
may
think
necessary
to
employ
the
look
he
received
in
return
was
eloquent
in
its
appeal
but
gryce
knew
no
relenting
where
his
duty
was
concerned
and
recognising
this
gillespie
took
a
fresh
resolve
and
boldly
said
you
have
discovered
that
i
carried
a
bottle
of
prussic
acid
into
my
father
house
the
day
before
he
died
shall
i
tell
you
where
i
procured
it
from
the
hand
of
her
who
lies
here
i
found
it
tied
about
her
neck
when
after
months
of
fruitless
search
i
was
led
to
investigate
mother
merry
she
was
asleep
when
i
discovered
it
asleep
in
a
way
i
always
found
it
impossible
to
break
and
the
shock
of
finding
her
in
quiet
possession
of
what
i
instinctively
knew
to
be
poison
maddened
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
tore
the
phial
away
from
her
and
put
in
its
place
a
roll
of
these
were
probably
stolen
from
her
as
no
proof
remains
of
her
having
used
them
but
the
bottle
i
carried
away
having
impulsively
thrust
it
into
my
trousers
pocket
at
the
first
intimation
i
received
of
a
raid
being
made
upon
the
place
by
the
police
the
explanation
was
so
natural
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
made
so
convincing
that
the
detective
look
and
mine
crossed
and
i
became
assured
that
he
as
well
as
myself
was
beginning
to
give
credence
to
this
man
i
can
give
no
information
of
the
use
which
was
made
of
this
drug
after
its
introduction
into
my
father
home
nor
can
i
designate
the
hand
which
took
it
from
my
bureau
where
i
placed
it
on
emptying
my
pockets
my
connection
with
it
ended
at
the
moment
i
speak
of
i
did
not
even
think
of
it
again
till
i
came
in
from
the
meeting
where
i
had
vainly
sought
distraction
and
found
my
father
lying
low
and
heard
the
cry
of
poison
raised
in
the
house
this
would
have
been
a
welcome
explanation
at
the
time
commented
gryce
your
delay
has
compromised
you
so
be
it
was
the
short
but
proud
reply
which
came
from
this
singular
man
when
you
reflect
that
by
the
time
i
was
able
to
satisfy
myself
that
this
bottle
was
missing
from
the
place
where
i
had
left
it
any
attempt
to
exonerate
myself
would
have
been
a
virtual
accusation
of
one
of
my
two
brothers
you
will
realise
why
i
hesitated
to
speak
then
and
only
bring
myself
to
speak
now
under
the
compelling
force
of
an
interest
greater
than
family
pride
or
affection
in
my
desire
to
share
the
last
offices
which
can
be
paid
to
my
wife
i
possibly
show
myself
for
the
second
time
a
coward
did
he
gryce
did
not
seem
to
think
so
the
forehead
of
this
aged
detective
was
clearing
fast
and
he
actually
looked
younger
by
ten
years
than
when
he
entered
this
house
yet
his
exactions
remained
the
same
and
gillespie
prepared
to
accommodate
himself
to
them
meanwhile
the
incessant
hammering
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
had
become
less
noticeable
and
the
drip
drip
on
the
sill
without
less
wearily
persistent
there
seemed
too
a
diminution
in
the
turbulence
of
the
wind
the
doors
and
windows
did
not
rattle
so
loudly
and
the
worst
noises
in
the
yards
below
had
ceased
anxious
to
see
if
the
storm
was
abating
i
raised
the
window
and
looked
out
rushing
clouds
with
great
torn
edges
met
my
eye
and
below
a
chaos
of
towering
walls
surrounding
an
abyss
in
which
the
imagination
could
picture
nothing
save
a
collection
of
foul
yards
and
reeking
alleys
recoiling
from
a
prospect
which
the
condition
of
my
mind
and
heart
made
more
than
usually
gloomy
i
turned
back
from
the
possible
tragedies
hidden
behind
those
great
walls
to
the
actual
one
in
which
i
had
myself
been
forced
to
take
so
ungracious
a
part
gillespie
was
waiting
to
speak
to
me
i
am
allowed
to
give
you
the
names
of
such
people
as
can
best
assist
you
in
the
removal
of
my
wife
he
remarked
here
they
are
together
with
the
address
in
new
jersey
where
i
wish
her
ultimately
carried
gryce
will
give
you
what
further
information
you
need
he
placed
a
paper
in
my
hand
with
a
word
of
quiet
thanks
to
which
i
responded
in
the
manner
i
felt
would
be
most
pleasing
to
hope
then
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
detective
i
have
promised
gillespie
the
privilege
of
passing
a
moment
in
this
room
unseen
and
alone
observed
that
official
stepping
towards
the
door
i
bowed
and
withdrew
shutting
gillespie
in
and
ourselves
out
instantly
all
the
noises
in
the
house
crowded
clamorously
to
our
ears
laughter
singing
brawling
the
screaming
of
children
and
the
scolding
of
their
distracted
mothers
made
a
sort
of
pandemonium
which
little
harmonised
with
the
mood
induced
by
the
pathetic
story
we
had
just
heard
but
it
was
not
for
us
to
be
particular
at
such
a
moment
and
i
was
glad
that
i
had
given
no
sign
of
my
inward
disturbance
when
gryce
suddenly
remarked
i
am
getting
old
his
alert
eye
and
attentive
ear
turned
towards
the
room
we
had
just
left
did
not
seem
to
indicate
it
i
find
that
such
scenes
make
a
deeper
impression
upon
me
than
formerly
i
no
longer
dwell
on
the
skill
it
takes
to
bring
them
about
but
rather
muse
upon
the
mistakes
and
woes
of
poor
humanity
which
make
them
possible
i
wished
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
gillespie
prospects
but
he
gave
me
no
encouragement
to
do
so
and
we
remained
silent
till
the
door
reopened
and
gillespie
came
out
i
am
ready
now
he
quietly
informed
us
outhwaite
i
can
trust
you
and
if
hope
he
stopped
and
looked
the
entreaty
he
dared
not
utter
i
will
tell
her
the
whole
story
just
as
it
has
fallen
from
your
lips
you
wish
me
to
he
signified
his
assent
but
still
looked
wistful
when
she
has
heard
the
true
cause
of
the
division
which
has
taken
place
between
you
and
other
members
of
your
family
she
will
act
as
her
own
kind
heart
will
prompt
her
i
added
he
would
have
pressed
my
hand
but
remembering
his
position
as
a
prisoner
refrained
let
us
go
he
now
said
in
natural
recoil
from
the
noises
which
just
then
burst
in
renewed
outcry
from
every
quarter
of
the
house
gryce
gave
a
faint
whistle
it
was
answered
in
the
same
guarded
manner
from
below
at
which
the
old
detective
turned
to
me
with
a
few
final
directions
after
which
with
a
promise
to
leave
me
well
guarded
he
made
a
gesture
which
gillespie
could
not
fail
to
understand
they
began
to
descend
when
gillespie
was
down
he
gave
one
backward
look
at
the
door
swaying
between
him
and
what
he
had
loved
best
on
earth
then
he
passed
on
and
i
was
left
standing
on
that
dingy
landing
alone
there
was
some
clamour
and
no
little
jeering
in
the
rooms
below
as
the
detectives
passed
through
them
with
their
prisoner
but
these
tokens
of
class
animosity
speedily
weakened
to
a
sullen
growl
amidst
which
i
thought
i
heard
the
rattling
of
departing
wheels
with
a
heart
as
heavy
as
the
silence
which
now
filled
the
house
i
turned
and
went
back
into
that
room
it
was
filled
with
moonlight
the
candle
from
which
the
had
long
ago
melted
and
run
upon
the
table
had
flickered
out
but
its
fitful
flame
was
not
missed
the
clouds
which
had
seemed
so
impenetrable
a
short
time
before
had
thinned
out
and
parted
till
they
flecked
rather
than
covered
the
white
disk
of
the
moon
now
revealed
for
the
first
time
in
days
that
storm
and
that
clearing
have
never
left
my
memory
as
the
last
lingering
shred
of
cloud
drifted
away
leaving
the
face
of
the
moon
quite
clear
i
found
courage
to
look
once
more
towards
the
bed
there
was
a
change
there
she
lay
not
as
before
with
her
features
quite
concealed
but
with
her
face
exposed
save
where
the
loose
curls
had
forced
their
way
across
her
cheeks
and
forehead
the
coverlet
drawn
close
under
her
chin
hung
smooth
and
decent
to
the
floor
and
across
it
lay
stretched
one
white
arm
upon
the
hand
of
which
shone
the
which
leighton
gillespie
had
taken
from
her
neck
and
placed
there
xxx
an
unexpected
ally
that
night
was
a
busy
one
for
me
nevertheless
i
found
time
to
send
a
message
to
hope
in
which
i
begged
her
to
read
no
papers
till
she
saw
me
and
if
possible
to
keep
herself
in
her
own
room
to
these
hurried
words
i
added
the
comforting
assurance
that
the
news
i
had
to
bring
her
would
repay
her
for
this
display
of
and
that
i
would
not
keep
her
waiting
any
longer
than
was
necessary
but
it
was
fully
ten
before
i
was
able
to
keep
this
promise
and
i
found
her
looking
pale
and
worn
i
have
obeyed
you
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
smiling
as
pitiful
as
it
was
ineffectual
what
has
happened
why
did
you
not
want
me
to
see
the
papers
or
talk
with
mrs
penrhyn
because
i
wished
to
be
the
first
to
tell
you
the
secret
of
leighton
gillespie
life
it
was
not
what
was
suggested
to
you
by
the
discrepancies
you
observed
between
his
character
and
life
he
is
sane
as
any
man
but
it
was
hard
to
proceed
with
those
eyes
of
unspeakable
longing
looking
straight
into
mine
but
he
has
had
great
sorrows
to
bear
great
suspenses
to
endure
a
deception
to
keep
up
not
altogether
justifiable
perhaps
but
yet
one
that
was
not
without
some
excuse
his
wife
did
you
ever
see
his
wife
no
she
did
not
perish
in
that
disaster
of
five
years
ago
as
everyone
supposed
and
it
was
she
oh
came
in
a
burst
of
sudden
comprehension
from
hope
as
she
sank
down
out
of
sight
among
the
curtains
by
the
window
but
the
next
moment
she
was
standing
again
crying
in
low
tones
in
which
i
caught
a
note
of
immeasurable
relief
i
thank
god
i
thank
god
then
the
sobs
came
i
noticed
that
once
she
had
taken
in
this
fact
of
his
personal
rectitude
all
fear
left
her
as
to
the
truth
of
the
more
serious
charge
against
him
even
after
i
had
explained
to
her
how
he
came
by
the
phial
of
poison
and
how
it
was
through
his
agency
it
came
to
be
in
his
father
house
no
doubt
came
to
mar
her
restored
confidence
in
this
her
most
cherished
relative
she
even
admitted
that
now
this
one
unexplainable
point
in
his
character
had
been
made
clear
to
her
she
felt
ready
to
meet
any
accusations
which
might
be
raised
against
him
let
them
publish
their
suspicions
she
cried
he
can
bear
them
and
so
can
i
for
now
that
he
has
been
proven
a
true
man
nothing
else
much
matters
i
may
blush
at
hearing
his
name
it
will
be
years
i
think
before
i
shall
overcome
that
but
it
will
be
because
i
failed
to
see
in
his
kindness
to
me
the
sympathetic
interest
of
one
whose
heart
has
been
made
tender
towards
women
by
his
wild
longing
after
the
wandering
spirit
whom
he
called
his
wife
then
she
asked
where
i
had
placed
a
name
so
natural
to
millicent
gillespie
that
no
other
was
ever
suggested
by
her
friends
and
having
been
told
where
said
she
would
like
to
sit
beside
her
until
the
time
came
to
lay
her
in
the
garden
of
that
little
home
from
which
all
shadow
was
now
cleared
away
save
that
of
chastened
sorrow
as
this
was
what
leighton
gillespie
secretly
wished
i
promised
to
accompany
her
to
new
jersey
and
then
taking
this
girl
by
the
hand
i
asked
have
i
performed
my
task
well
her
answer
was
but
that
is
my
secret
small
reason
as
it
gave
me
for
personal
hope
i
yet
went
from
that
house
with
my
heart
lightened
of
its
heaviest
load
i
did
not
read
the
papers
myself
that
morning
i
had
little
heart
for
a
reporter
version
of
what
had
so
thrilled
me
coming
from
own
lips
merely
satisfying
myself
that
the
latter
was
still
in
custody
i
busied
myself
with
what
came
up
in
my
office
till
the
stroke
of
five
released
me
to
a
free
exercise
of
my
own
thoughts
how
much
nearer
were
we
to
the
solution
of
this
mystery
than
we
had
been
the
morning
following
gillespie
death
not
much
and
while
hope
and
possibly
myself
felt
that
the
band
of
suspicion
had
narrowed
in
its
circle
and
by
the
exclusion
of
leighton
whom
we
could
no
longer
look
upon
as
guilty
left
the
question
of
culpability
to
be
settled
between
the
two
remaining
sons
of
the
deceased
stockbroker
to
the
world
in
general
and
to
the
readers
of
sensational
journals
which
now
flooded
the
city
with
accounts
of
the
most
sacred
incidents
of
leighton
gillespie
past
life
he
was
still
the
man
through
whose
agency
the
poison
had
entered
the
gillespie
house
nor
could
we
fail
to
see
that
the
feeling
called
out
by
these
tales
of
his
domestic
infelicities
and
the
wild
search
in
which
most
of
his
life
had
been
passed
had
its
reverse
side
for
those
people
who
read
all
stories
of
disinterested
affection
with
doubt
and
place
no
more
faith
in
true
religion
than
if
the
few
bright
spots
made
in
the
universal
history
of
mankind
by
acts
of
unselfish
devotion
had
no
basis
in
fact
and
were
as
imaginary
as
the
dreams
of
poet
or
romancer
that
leighton
gillespie
had
not
been
released
after
his
conference
with
the
district
attorney
was
proof
that
his
way
was
not
as
clear
before
him
as
i
had
hoped
yet
i
was
positive
that
gryce
as
well
as
sweetwater
shared
my
belief
in
his
innocence
and
while
this
was
a
comfort
to
me
i
found
my
mind
much
exercised
by
the
doubt
as
to
what
the
next
turn
of
the
kaleidoscope
would
call
up
in
this
case
i
had
not
seen
underhill
in
days
and
i
rather
dreaded
a
chance
meeting
he
did
not
like
leighton
and
would
be
the
first
to
throw
contempt
upon
any
mercy
being
shown
him
on
account
of
his
faithful
attachment
to
his
disreputable
wife
i
seemed
to
hear
the
drawling
query
with
which
this
favourite
of
the
clubs
would
end
any
attempt
i
might
make
in
this
direction
and
so
you
think
it
probable
that
a
man
a
man
remember
with
a
child
liable
to
flutter
in
and
out
of
his
room
at
all
hours
would
leave
a
phial
of
deadly
poison
on
his
dresser
and
never
think
of
it
again
not
much
old
man
if
he
laid
it
down
there
which
i
doubt
he
took
it
up
again
do
waste
your
sympathy
on
a
cad
yet
i
did
and
to
such
an
extent
that
i
took
a
walk
instead
of
going
home
and
hearing
these
imaginary
sentences
uttered
in
articulated
words
i
walked
up
madison
avenue
and
coming
upon
a
store
which
had
a
reputation
for
an
extra
fine
brand
of
cigars
i
went
in
to
buy
one
have
you
ever
greatly
desired
an
event
which
your
common
sense
told
you
was
most
unlikely
to
happen
and
then
suddenly
seen
it
wrought
out
before
you
in
the
most
unforeseen
manner
and
by
the
most
ordinary
of
means
from
the
first
night
of
the
tragedy
with
which
these
pages
have
been
full
i
had
wished
for
an
interview
with
the
old
butler
without
witnesses
and
as
the
result
of
a
seeming
chance
but
i
had
never
seen
my
way
clear
to
this
and
now
in
this
place
and
in
this
unexpected
manner
i
came
upon
him
buying
fruit
at
a
grocer
counter
i
did
not
hesitate
to
approach
him
how
do
you
do
hewson
said
i
with
a
kindly
tap
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
slowly
gave
me
a
look
that
was
half
an
apology
and
half
an
appeal
then
dropped
his
eyes
how
do
you
do
sir
said
he
been
buying
oranges
for
the
family
i
went
on
startling
news
this
i
mean
the
arrest
of
gillespie
second
son
i
never
thought
of
him
as
the
guilty
one
did
you
the
old
butler
did
not
break
all
up
as
i
expected
he
only
shook
his
head
and
taking
up
the
bundle
which
had
just
been
handed
him
remarked
we
little
know
what
in
the
mind
of
the
babies
we
dandle
in
our
arms
and
went
feebly
out
i
laid
down
a
quarter
took
a
cigar
from
the
case
forgot
to
light
it
and
sauntered
into
the
street
with
it
still
in
my
hand
i
felt
thoroughly
discouraged
and
walked
down
the
avenue
in
a
sort
of
black
mist
formed
of
my
own
doubts
and
hewson
calm
acceptance
of
the
guilt
attributed
to
leighton
but
suddenly
i
stopped
put
the
cigar
in
my
pocket
and
exclaimed
in
vehement
contradiction
of
my
own
uneasy
thoughts
leighton
gillespie
is
as
guiltless
of
his
father
death
as
of
other
charges
which
have
been
made
against
him
i
am
ready
to
stake
my
own
honour
upon
it
and
went
immediately
to
my
apartments
without
stopping
as
i
usually
did
at
underhill
door
i
found
a
young
man
waiting
for
me
in
the
vestibule
he
had
evidently
been
standing
there
for
some
time
for
he
no
sooner
heard
my
step
than
he
gave
a
bound
forward
with
the
eager
cry
it
is
i
sir
sweetwater
he
was
a
welcome
visitor
at
that
moment
and
i
was
willing
he
should
realise
it
come
in
come
in
i
urged
new
developments
eh
gillespie
released
perhaps
or
no
was
his
disappointing
response
as
the
door
closed
behind
us
and
he
sank
into
the
chair
i
pushed
forward
gillespie
is
still
in
detention
and
there
are
no
new
developments
but
another
day
must
not
pass
without
them
i
was
witness
to
the
sympathy
you
felt
last
night
for
the
man
who
claimed
the
wretched
being
we
saw
before
us
for
his
wife
and
feeling
a
little
towards
him
myself
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
lay
your
head
with
mine
over
this
case
in
the
hope
that
we
two
together
may
light
upon
some
clue
which
will
lead
to
his
immediate
enlargement
for
i
can
not
believe
him
guilty
i
just
can
not
it
was
one
of
the
others
but
which
one
i
do
mean
to
eat
or
sleep
till
i
find
out
and
mr
gryce
he
wo
bother
last
night
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
has
gone
home
the
field
is
clear
sir
quite
clear
and
i
mean
to
profit
by
it
leighton
gillespie
shall
be
freed
in
time
to
attend
his
funeral
or
i
will
give
up
the
detective
business
and
go
back
to
the
carpenter
bench
and
my
dear
old
mother
in
sutherlandtown
xxxi
sweetwater
has
an
idea
i
was
greatly
interested
taking
out
a
box
of
cigars
i
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table
be
free
with
them
said
i
if
there
is
any
help
to
be
got
out
of
smoke
let
us
make
use
of
it
he
eyed
the
cigars
ruefully
too
bad
he
murmured
unfortunately
it
does
not
work
that
way
with
me
some
people
think
better
between
whiffs
but
smoking
clouds
my
faculties
and
i
would
be
no
friend
to
gillespie
if
i
took
your
cigars
now
free
air
and
an
undisturbed
mind
for
caleb
sweetwater
when
he
settles
down
to
work
smoke
yourself
sir
that
wo
affect
me
but
draw
the
box
to
your
side
of
the
table
and
give
me
a
rebuking
look
if
my
hand
goes
out
to
it
before
this
subject
is
settled
i
did
as
he
requested
but
not
to
the
point
of
taking
a
cigar
i
could
think
without
its
aid
as
well
as
he
now
sir
he
immediately
began
you
were
the
first
man
to
enter
upon
the
scene
of
crime
may
i
ask
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
relate
afresh
and
circumstantially
your
whole
experience
with
gillespie
you
can
not
be
too
minute
in
your
details
somehow
or
somewhere
we
have
missed
the
clue
necessary
to
the
clearing
up
of
this
case
you
may
be
able
to
supply
it
will
it
bore
you
too
much
to
try
not
in
the
least
i
am
as
anxious
as
yourself
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
business
begin
then
sir
you
wo
mind
my
closing
my
eyes
i
find
it
so
much
easier
to
identify
myself
with
the
situation
when
i
see
nothing
about
to
distract
me
and
sir
since
i
dread
speaking
when
actively
absorbed
in
this
kind
of
work
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
simply
raise
my
finger
when
i
want
a
minute
for
reflection
i
know
i
am
a
crank
and
not
much
used
to
gentlemen
ways
but
i
appreciate
kindness
more
than
most
folks
especially
when
it
takes
the
form
of
respect
paid
to
my
whims
i
assured
him
i
was
only
too
ready
to
do
anything
which
would
serve
to
further
the
end
we
had
in
view
and
all
preliminaries
being
thus
amicably
settled
he
dropped
his
head
into
his
hands
and
i
began
my
tale
in
much
the
same
language
i
have
used
in
these
pages
he
listened
without
a
movement
while
i
spoke
of
claire
and
of
my
entrance
into
the
house
but
his
finger
went
up
when
i
mentioned
the
appearance
presented
by
gillespie
as
he
stood
propping
himself
against
the
table
in
a
condition
of
impending
collapse
was
the
house
quiet
he
asked
did
you
hear
no
sneaking
step
in
the
halls
or
adjacent
not
a
step
i
remember
receiving
the
impression
that
this
old
gentleman
and
his
grandchild
were
all
alone
in
the
house
one
of
the
greatest
surprises
of
my
life
was
the
discovery
that
there
were
servants
in
the
basement
and
more
than
one
member
of
the
family
on
the
floors
above
a
discovery
which
leads
to
our
first
argument
sir
we
have
taken
it
for
granted
and
certainly
we
were
justified
in
doing
so
that
gillespie
knew
whose
hand
poured
out
the
poison
he
felt
burning
into
his
vitals
we
have
argued
that
it
was
this
knowledge
which
led
him
to
spend
the
final
moments
of
his
life
in
an
extraordinary
effort
to
settle
the
doubts
of
his
favourite
niece
but
sir
if
he
had
had
this
knowledge
would
he
not
have
mentioned
outright
and
without
any
circumlocution
the
name
of
the
son
he
had
finally
settled
upon
as
the
guilty
one
rather
than
have
made
use
of
the
same
vague
phrase
which
had
been
his
torment
and
hers
ever
since
the
hour
he
told
her
of
the
shadowy
hand
he
had
detected
hovering
over
his
glass
of
medicine
with
the
remembrance
in
your
mind
of
the
few
words
he
left
behind
him
are
you
ready
to
declare
that
you
find
in
them
any
proof
of
his
knowing
then
any
better
than
before
which
of
his
three
sons
had
mingled
poison
with
his
drink
and
sir
you
are
a
lawyer
does
it
follow
from
any
evidence
we
have
since
received
that
he
even
positively
knew
it
was
one
of
these
three
men
might
not
his
fears
and
the
haunting
memory
of
that
former
attempt
have
so
worked
upon
his
failing
faculties
that
he
took
for
granted
it
was
one
of
his
sons
who
had
made
this
last
effort
at
poisoning
him
it
is
possible
i
admitted
but
you
do
place
much
stress
on
the
suggestion
no
said
i
i
do
anxious
as
i
am
that
each
and
all
of
these
young
men
should
be
relieved
from
the
appalling
charge
of
parricide
i
saw
too
great
a
display
of
anxiety
on
his
part
for
the
right
delivery
of
what
he
believed
to
hold
the
last
communication
he
had
to
make
to
his
favourite
niece
for
me
to
think
these
final
words
of
his
contained
nothing
more
definite
than
a
repetition
of
his
former
vague
surmise
he
was
facing
immediate
death
yet
all
his
thought
all
his
strength
were
devoted
to
the
effort
of
making
her
know
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
in
his
former
conclusion
that
it
one
of
his
sons
who
sought
his
life
and
that
this
son
had
now
actually
succeeded
in
poisoning
him
that
he
did
not
proceed
further
and
name
which
one
was
due
probably
to
a
sudden
loss
of
strength
that
he
meant
to
say
more
than
he
did
is
evident
from
the
which
follows
the
four
words
we
have
been
considering
true
true
but
my
argument
holds
an
argument
which
the
difficulties
of
the
case
surely
justify
me
in
advancing
you
say
he
would
never
have
made
such
an
effort
to
insure
the
safe
delivery
of
words
that
were
a
mere
repetition
of
a
former
statement
yet
what
more
were
they
in
the
unfinished
condition
in
which
we
find
them
do
you
think
he
could
have
been
blind
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
succeeded
in
mentioning
the
name
which
alone
could
give
value
to
his
accusation
and
make
its
safe
delivery
a
matter
of
real
moment
to
miss
meredith
surely
sir
you
do
not
believe
his
wits
were
so
far
gone
that
he
regarded
himself
as
having
made
his
suspicions
clear
in
those
five
words
of
my
sons
no
i
do
not
yet
who
can
tell
bright
as
his
eye
was
his
faculty
of
memory
as
well
as
of
observation
may
have
left
him
witness
how
he
tore
off
the
blank
edge
of
the
paper
instead
of
the
words
he
wished
to
send
i
know
sweetwater
tone
was
gloomy
a
cloud
seemed
to
have
settled
upon
his
newly
risen
hopes
nevertheless
i
now
felt
bound
to
admit
i
can
not
quite
bring
myself
to
believe
that
he
was
so
bewildered
on
the
contrary
i
feel
confident
that
he
was
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
when
he
cast
that
dramatic
glance
upward
which
by
a
happy
inspiration
i
was
led
to
interpret
as
meaning
hope
if
we
could
penetrate
this
matter
to
its
very
core
i
believe
we
should
find
the
truth
we
seek
either
in
those
five
words
themselves
or
in
the
means
he
took
of
getting
them
to
miss
meredith
have
you
ever
thought
sweetwater
that
we
have
not
given
all
the
attention
we
should
to
the
latter
fact
yes
sir
his
hands
had
fallen
from
his
face
and
he
spoke
with
volubility
it
has
struck
you
i
see
as
oddly
as
it
has
us
that
it
was
a
very
strange
thing
for
him
to
send
into
the
street
for
a
messenger
when
he
had
one
right
at
his
hand
claire
do
you
mean
yes
but
claire
is
a
child
the
slip
of
paper
to
which
he
attached
such
importance
was
unsealed
and
he
dreaded
its
falling
into
wrong
hands
miss
meredith
already
knew
his
secret
but
for
him
to
proclaim
openly
that
his
death
was
due
to
the
hatred
or
cupidity
of
one
of
his
children
would
not
be
the
act
of
a
father
who
already
at
the
cost
of
so
much
misery
to
himself
nay
as
it
proved
at
the
cost
of
his
life
had
kept
back
from
every
ear
save
that
of
the
one
confidant
of
his
misery
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
a
previous
attempt
had
been
made
upon
his
life
yet
to
send
into
the
street
for
a
messenger
why
not
send
for
one
of
the
servants
or
why
if
he
knew
which
son
he
had
cause
to
fear
did
he
not
bid
the
child
bring
down
one
of
the
others
leighton
was
out
george
was
half
drunk
and
alfred
was
two
flights
up
besides
he
might
have
thought
that
an
alarm
of
this
kind
would
prevent
the
delivery
of
the
letter
on
which
he
laid
such
stress
who
knows
what
goes
on
in
the
mind
of
a
man
conscious
of
having
but
one
minute
in
which
to
perform
the
most
important
act
of
his
life
true
true
sir
and
yet
there
is
something
unnatural
in
his
conduct
something
i
fail
to
understand
but
i
do
despair
i
wo
despair
we
have
only
begun
the
recapitulation
of
details
from
which
i
hope
so
much
supposing
we
go
on
and
he
sunk
his
head
again
in
his
hands
i
at
once
took
up
the
thread
of
my
relation
at
the
point
where
i
had
dropped
it
when
i
approached
gillespie
i
noted
three
things
besides
his
tortured
face
and
sinking
figure
first
that
the
shade
was
pulled
up
over
his
desk
second
that
a
typewriter
stood
close
to
his
hand
and
third
that
a
pot
of
paste
knocked
over
by
some
previous
movement
on
his
part
lay
near
the
typewriter
with
its
contents
oozing
over
a
sheet
of
unused
paper
you
ask
me
to
mention
all
details
and
i
have
done
so
dreamily
he
moved
his
finger
but
whether
in
thanks
or
in
an
injunction
for
me
to
continue
i
could
not
determine
i
therefore
remained
still
i
saw
the
paste
he
murmured
and
taking
this
as
an
intimation
to
proceed
i
went
on
till
i
came
to
the
moment
when
i
pulled
down
the
shade
you
glanced
out
as
you
did
that
said
he
lifting
his
finger
as
a
signal
for
me
to
pause
yes
and
saw
rosenthal
in
his
room
in
the
neighbouring
extension
yes
standing
how
with
his
back
or
his
face
to
the
window
his
back
he
was
sauntering
about
his
room
so
that
settles
one
fact
he
had
not
been
looking
into
gillespie
room
at
a
critical
moment
had
he
seen
that
gentleman
in
a
suffering
condition
or
noted
the
curious
incidents
following
your
entrance
he
would
have
been
held
to
the
spot
by
his
curiosity
and
you
would
have
encountered
his
eager
face
staring
down
upon
a
scene
of
such
uncommon
interest
very
true
all
he
saw
was
the
seemingly
insignificant
incident
of
gillespie
emptying
the
contents
of
a
out
of
his
window
as
sweetwater
had
no
remark
to
make
to
this
i
proceeded
with
my
narrative
relating
with
a
careful
attention
to
details
my
journey
upstairs
the
words
i
had
overheard
at
the
door
of
alfred
room
my
first
sight
of
hope
and
i
was
proceeding
to
describe
the
results
of
my
intrusion
into
the
gillespie
attic
when
i
perceived
that
sweetwater
was
no
longer
listening
his
head
which
he
had
raised
from
between
his
hands
was
turned
my
way
but
his
eyes
were
looking
into
space
and
his
whole
body
was
quivering
in
intense
excitement
such
as
i
have
seldom
seen
as
i
paused
he
came
back
to
earth
and
jumped
to
his
feet
come
he
cried
come
with
me
to
the
gillespie
house
i
have
an
idea
it
may
not
stand
the
test
it
may
prove
a
fatuous
one
but
the
very
hair
on
his
forehead
was
bristling
the
eagerness
he
tried
to
keep
out
of
his
voice
showed
itself
in
his
eyes
and
in
every
jerking
movement
which
he
made
come
he
cried
again
it
is
not
late
we
will
find
the
young
gentlemen
at
home
and
perhaps
he
added
nothing
to
that
significant
perhaps
but
his
repressed
excitement
had
awakened
mine
and
my
hat
was
on
and
i
was
following
him
down
stairs
before
i
realised
that
i
had
failed
to
turn
out
my
gas
as
i
wheeled
about
with
the
intention
of
rectifying
this
oversight
i
encountered
underhill
languid
figure
loitering
in
his
doorway
he
accosted
me
with
an
easy
halloo
outhwaite
then
as
he
leaned
close
enough
to
whisper
in
my
ear
he
added
in
an
indescribable
drawl
these
unexpected
words
i
recognise
your
friend
there
if
you
are
piling
up
the
evidence
against
poor
leighton
gillespie
you
are
doing
wrong
no
fellow
with
a
heart
like
his
ever
put
poison
into
his
father
wine
which
shows
the
folly
of
thinking
you
know
a
man
mind
before
he
speaks
it
xxxii
with
the
shade
down
not
many
words
passed
between
sweetwater
and
myself
on
our
way
up
the
avenue
he
had
his
idea
to
brood
upon
while
i
was
engaged
in
turning
over
in
my
mind
various
vague
conjectures
rising
out
of
the
argument
we
had
just
indulged
in
but
before
reaching
the
point
of
our
destination
i
ventured
upon
one
question
have
you
during
any
of
your
investigations
public
or
private
learned
which
of
the
three
sons
of
gillespie
is
the
greatest
favourite
with
the
old
family
servant
hewson
no
that
is
yes
why
do
you
ask
because
if
it
is
not
leighton
and
it
certainly
is
not
then
i
advise
you
to
direct
your
energies
towards
the
one
he
is
known
to
like
best
sweetwater
stopped
short
and
surveyed
me
in
very
evident
surprise
before
venturing
upon
the
following
remark
i
should
like
to
know
just
why
you
say
that
i
replied
by
relating
my
interview
with
the
butler
in
the
and
his
easy
acceptance
of
leighton
guilt
as
implied
in
the
arrest
which
had
just
taken
place
sweetwater
listened
and
moved
on
but
so
quickly
now
i
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
him
if
my
idea
has
no
uncertainty
in
it
and
i
have
lighted
upon
a
way
out
of
this
mystery
i
will
be
made
for
life
he
declared
as
we
reached
the
gillespie
house
and
he
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
but
there
i
counting
chickens
something
which
gryce
never
approves
of
at
any
stage
of
the
game
and
rushing
up
the
stoop
he
rang
the
bell
while
i
waited
below
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
as
they
say
who
would
respond
to
the
summons
and
if
we
effected
an
entrance
which
i
felt
to
be
a
matter
of
some
doubt
whom
would
we
be
likely
to
come
upon
in
a
visit
of
this
nature
george
alfred
i
did
not
like
to
ask
and
sweetwater
did
not
volunteer
to
inform
me
the
opening
of
the
door
cut
short
my
reflections
as
well
as
gave
answer
to
my
doubt
old
hewson
and
hewson
only
opened
the
door
of
this
house
and
whether
this
renewed
encounter
with
his
patient
figure
had
something
disappointing
in
it
or
whether
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
interior
thus
quietly
disclosed
to
view
produced
an
impression
of
family
life
that
was
more
than
painful
under
the
circumstances
i
experienced
a
recoil
from
the
errand
which
had
brought
me
there
and
would
have
retreated
if
i
had
not
recalled
hope
interest
in
this
matter
and
the
joy
it
would
give
her
to
see
leighton
gillespie
proved
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
at
present
held
in
custody
meantime
sweetwater
with
an
air
of
perfect
nonchalance
admirably
assumed
had
stepped
past
hewson
into
the
house
evidently
he
was
accustomed
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
place
at
will
and
though
the
old
servant
did
not
fail
to
show
his
indignation
at
this
palpable
infringement
upon
the
family
dignity
he
did
not
abate
a
jot
of
his
usual
politeness
or
even
watch
the
unwelcome
intruder
too
closely
in
his
passage
down
the
hall
but
his
complaisance
did
not
extend
to
me
he
gave
me
a
look
which
demanded
a
response
some
formality
of
the
law
i
whispered
hoping
that
the
unaccustomed
words
would
befog
the
old
man
sufficiently
to
cover
my
own
embarrassment
and
answer
any
doubts
he
might
have
as
to
the
purpose
of
our
errand
there
and
perhaps
they
did
for
with
some
muttered
words
among
which
i
heard
this
pathetic
phrase
there
are
so
many
of
them
he
crept
away
and
disappeared
through
the
door
leading
into
the
as
he
did
so
i
noted
a
man
sitting
on
a
settee
pushed
well
into
the
corner
near
the
study
door
i
did
not
know
this
man
i
only
noted
that
he
sat
there
very
quietly
and
that
the
only
movement
he
made
at
our
approach
was
a
slight
raising
and
falling
of
his
fingers
on
his
crossed
arms
we
were
making
for
the
study
behind
the
stairs
and
into
this
room
sweetwater
after
unlocking
it
with
a
key
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
now
walked
do
you
object
to
visiting
this
place
again
he
asked
striking
a
match
and
reaching
up
to
light
the
gas
of
course
i
answered
no
yet
it
was
not
quite
a
pleasant
experience
to
stand
there
and
watch
the
light
flickering
on
his
face
in
a
spot
where
i
had
last
seen
the
one
horrid
spectacle
of
my
life
but
when
the
cheerful
flame
had
sprung
up
and
walls
made
familiar
not
by
long
seeing
but
close
seeing
had
come
into
view
i
was
conscious
simply
of
a
strong
desire
to
know
why
i
had
been
brought
to
this
room
in
such
haste
and
secrecy
and
what
the
idea
was
which
had
produced
so
marked
an
effect
upon
my
singular
companion
he
showed
no
immediate
intention
of
enlightening
me
he
was
engaged
in
casting
a
keen
glance
about
him
a
glance
which
seemingly
took
in
every
detail
of
the
room
then
as
if
satisfied
that
nothing
had
been
disturbed
since
his
last
visit
he
advanced
to
the
window
and
pulled
down
the
shade
we
will
not
have
the
curious
rosenthal
giving
away
secrets
he
dryly
commented
and
this
is
our
secret
is
it
not
you
wo
feel
called
upon
to
repeat
outside
what
goes
on
between
us
in
this
room
certainly
not
the
assurance
seemed
unnecessary
but
i
did
not
regret
giving
it
when
i
saw
how
it
relieved
him
of
all
doubt
and
caused
his
eye
to
lighten
and
his
manner
to
grow
easy
as
he
went
on
to
say
so
far
as
mortal
calculation
can
go
this
room
has
not
been
entered
by
anyone
but
the
police
or
persons
acting
under
the
instructions
of
the
police
since
the
hour
when
gillespie
was
carried
out
of
it
consequently
we
have
a
right
to
expect
all
articles
remaining
here
to
be
in
the
same
condition
as
on
that
night
this
for
instance
he
had
taken
out
the
typewriter
from
a
closet
built
in
one
of
the
corners
and
set
it
as
he
spoke
down
in
its
old
place
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
ah
i
burst
forth
your
idea
is
in
connection
with
this
typewriter
he
frowned
or
almost
frowned
for
he
was
an
amiable
fellow
then
giving
me
a
pleading
look
observed
i
am
young
yet
outhwaite
and
it
is
very
easy
for
me
to
deceive
myself
with
imaginary
results
you
will
therefore
allow
me
a
minute
to
myself
and
if
i
find
out
that
i
have
struck
a
false
trail
or
if
my
idea
proves
to
be
one
i
can
not
sustain
by
facts
i
sing
out
and
we
will
consult
as
to
our
next
move
shall
i
step
outside
i
asked
but
this
he
would
not
listen
to
all
i
want
said
he
is
for
you
to
look
the
other
way
while
i
stoop
over
this
typewriter
i
naturally
felt
disposed
to
humour
him
and
meanwhile
he
remained
so
still
that
i
was
confident
he
did
not
touch
the
instrument
but
the
cry
which
impetuously
burst
from
him
after
a
moment
of
intense
stillness
startled
me
so
i
can
never
forget
it
it
was
something
between
a
sob
and
a
shout
and
it
was
so
suggestive
of
triumph
that
i
could
not
forbear
turning
about
and
rushing
up
to
the
instrument
over
which
he
still
stooped
he
greeted
me
with
a
look
of
delight
and
a
rush
of
confused
gestures
see
sir
oh
see
how
i
wish
gryce
were
here
look
at
the
top
of
that
key
sir
the
one
with
the
words
key
on
it
yes
that
one
that
what
is
the
matter
with
it
tell
me
the
face
of
it
is
obscured
i
can
scarcely
read
the
words
there
is
something
on
it
something
like
paste
he
cried
the
paste
that
ran
out
of
the
bottle
and
spread
over
the
desk
you
can
still
see
unmistakable
signs
of
it
here
and
here
pointing
rapidly
as
he
spoke
for
gryce
would
not
allow
a
woman
in
the
room
and
nothing
has
been
cleaned
since
that
night
the
paste
is
but
a
dry
crust
now
but
you
must
remember
that
it
was
moist
when
gillespie
stooped
over
the
table
so
that
when
his
fingers
got
into
it
in
his
struggle
to
reach
the
typewriter
he
readily
transferred
it
to
the
keys
this
will
be
apparent
to
you
if
you
will
scrutinise
the
exact
keys
he
made
use
of
in
writing
those
last
five
words
observe
the
one
marked
now
this
and
now
the
there
is
but
a
trace
of
paste
on
some
of
them
but
it
is
thick
on
the
and
thicker
still
on
what
key
sir
the
one
you
first
drew
my
attention
to
the
one
marked
key
just
so
now
do
you
know
the
use
of
the
key
i
do
not
you
press
it
down
when
you
wish
the
letter
you
are
writing
to
be
a
capital
for
instance
i
wish
to
write
the
capital
i
hold
down
this
key
with
one
finger
and
strike
the
key
marked
with
another
yes
but
oh
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
capital
appears
in
the
five
words
we
are
now
considering
true
sir
but
does
not
this
paste
on
the
key
show
that
he
made
an
effort
to
write
one
that
a
capital
was
in
his
mind
even
if
it
did
not
get
on
paper
in
beginning
any
communication
one
naturally
starts
with
a
capital
and
you
see
sir
that
the
space
between
this
last
hurriedly
added
phrase
and
the
words
of
his
unfinished
letter
is
long
enough
to
hold
one
but
the
haste
and
agitation
of
this
dying
man
were
such
that
he
did
not
put
enough
force
into
his
stroke
to
bring
an
impression
of
this
opening
capital
if
therefore
we
would
read
this
communication
intelligently
it
is
imperative
upon
us
to
supply
this
missing
capital
now
what
letter
do
you
think
he
meant
to
write
there
and
did
not
i
blankly
shook
my
head
my
thoughts
were
in
a
great
whirl
there
is
but
one
he
cried
which
would
make
any
sense
the
letter
n
sir
the
famous
letter
supply
that
letter
sir
then
tell
me
how
those
words
would
read
you
know
them
well
or
stay
i
have
them
here
and
sweetwater
spread
before
me
a
copy
of
the
letter
as
it
appeared
after
gillespie
had
added
the
five
words
which
had
moulded
the
whole
course
of
the
investigation
up
to
this
point
but
this
was
an
unnecessary
precaution
on
his
part
i
knew
the
words
by
heart
and
already
had
prefixed
to
them
the
capital
n
which
he
had
just
convinced
me
belonged
there
as
witness
one
of
my
sons
he
none
of
my
sons
he
oh
i
cried
what
a
difference
young
sweetwater
face
absolutely
shone
is
there
he
cried
i
got
that
idea
while
you
were
talking
about
miss
meredith
but
that
is
not
all
we
are
not
through
with
our
experiments
yet
a
letter
prefixed
is
not
enough
we
need
to
affix
a
few
can
you
supply
them
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
of
my
sons
fails
to
make
good
sense
outhwaite
but
look
replacing
the
paper
in
the
typewriter
he
pressed
a
few
keys
lifted
the
carriage
and
drew
me
down
to
see
imagine
my
amazement
and
the
shock
given
to
all
my
previous
convictions
when
i
saw
written
before
me
these
words
none
of
my
sons
hewson
xxxiii
in
which
we
can
pardon
gryce
his
unfortunate
illness
you
did
expect
that
i
thought
i
would
surprise
you
sir
oh
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
sweetwater
eagerly
continued
you
miss
the
period
and
capital
h
which
would
show
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
proper
name
but
sir
gillespie
would
not
have
been
the
failing
man
he
was
if
by
this
time
he
could
think
of
capitals
much
less
periods
he
was
not
even
able
to
complete
the
word
though
he
evidently
failed
to
realise
this
of
my
sons
hewson
is
what
was
in
his
mind
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
and
now
he
triumphantly
concluded
after
a
short
but
satisfied
contemplation
of
my
face
you
can
see
why
this
dying
man
should
expend
his
last
energies
in
insuring
the
safe
delivery
of
these
words
to
the
one
person
who
knew
his
former
dreadful
suspicions
shrinking
as
any
father
might
from
letting
his
sons
know
to
what
a
fearful
extent
he
had
misjudged
them
and
dreading
as
he
doubtless
had
good
reason
to
some
interference
on
the
part
of
hewson
if
he
attempted
to
call
any
one
in
the
house
to
his
aid
he
sent
his
little
grandchild
into
the
street
but
i
know
we
are
dealing
with
mere
possibilities
as
yet
sir
but
these
possibilities
are
much
more
credible
than
the
surmises
in
which
we
have
hitherto
indulged
i
feel
as
if
free
air
had
entered
my
lungs
for
the
first
time
since
the
inquest
and
if
i
can
refrain
from
yielding
too
much
to
the
intoxication
of
it
but
i
again
repeated
determined
to
have
my
say
out
before
he
had
gone
too
far
what
motive
can
you
ascribe
to
this
poor
old
servant
for
a
death
which
robbed
him
of
a
master
he
had
served
devotedly
for
years
motive
be
cried
sweetwater
in
some
heat
but
with
his
usual
good
nature
he
instantly
begged
my
pardon
and
his
next
words
were
uttered
with
more
restraint
facts
first
motives
afterwards
what
motive
have
we
been
able
to
find
for
the
committal
of
this
deed
by
any
one
of
his
sons
yet
each
and
all
of
them
have
been
suspected
and
almost
arraigned
still
he
concluded
if
you
want
a
motive
search
for
it
here
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
second
folded
paper
which
he
opened
out
before
my
eyes
it
was
a
copy
of
gillespie
will
ah
i
cried
in
dim
perception
of
what
he
meant
a
thousand
dollars
explained
sweetwater
not
much
in
your
eyes
but
quite
a
fortune
in
his
and
for
so
paltry
a
legacy
you
think
that
this
man
sweetwater
finger
went
to
his
lips
excuse
me
said
he
but
had
we
not
better
put
back
this
typewriter
on
the
shelf
from
which
we
took
it
if
i
do
not
mistake
it
will
figure
largely
in
the
trial
which
i
plainly
see
approaching
i
nodded
recognising
the
wisdom
of
the
admonition
thus
given
and
together
we
placed
the
typewriter
back
in
the
closet
then
he
turned
towards
me
with
a
new
light
in
his
small
grey
eye
and
now
sir
he
cried
let
me
request
you
to
stand
back
a
trifle
i
am
going
to
finish
this
business
opening
the
door
with
a
sudden
jerk
he
plunged
into
the
hall
a
shadow
was
just
disappearing
from
the
opposite
doorway
with
a
shout
to
me
to
light
up
he
leaped
across
the
hall
into
the
the
next
minute
i
heard
a
cry
then
a
low
gurgle
then
the
match
i
had
hastily
struck
flared
up
and
i
beheld
the
detective
holding
down
the
butler
and
looking
eagerly
towards
me
for
the
expected
light
the
man
in
the
hall
was
by
this
time
at
my
side
and
between
us
we
soon
had
three
jets
lit
illuminating
two
white
faces
pale
with
triumph
hewson
from
fear
murderer
poisoner
of
your
benefactor
and
friend
i
have
you
at
last
cried
the
struggling
detective
watching
how
each
terrible
word
he
hurled
blanched
to
a
greater
and
greater
degree
the
face
he
held
pressed
back
for
our
inspection
you
could
see
without
faltering
your
master
sons
the
boys
you
have
dandled
on
your
knee
fall
one
after
the
other
under
the
shadow
of
public
suspicion
now
we
will
see
if
you
can
show
as
much
heroism
on
your
own
account
you
are
the
man
who
drugged
gillespie
wine
and
if
the
officer
here
will
take
you
in
charge
for
an
hour
or
so
i
will
go
down
and
procure
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
sweetwater
manner
one
of
such
complete
conviction
that
the
old
man
succumbed
to
it
without
a
struggle
mercy
he
moaned
i
was
old
tired
of
work
a
little
home
a
little
freedom
in
my
old
age
a
a
i
fled
from
the
room
it
seemed
as
if
the
walls
must
cave
in
upon
us
for
this
for
this
the
sight
of
a
frightened
faces
in
the
hall
restored
my
the
servants
had
come
up
from
below
and
stood
crowding
and
jostling
each
other
just
as
they
had
done
three
weeks
before
at
the
sight
of
hewson
cowering
figure
they
began
to
moan
and
cry
be
quiet
there
exhorted
sweetwater
advancing
upon
them
with
the
courage
born
of
his
triumphant
success
the
old
man
whom
you
have
doubtless
thought
the
and
most
reliable
of
you
all
has
just
confessed
to
the
crime
which
has
desolated
this
house
and
all
but
ruined
the
three
young
gentlemen
your
masters
cry
away
if
you
want
to
but
cry
quietly
and
without
giving
the
least
alarm
for
the
good
news
has
not
gone
upstairs
yet
and
this
gentleman
who
was
the
first
to
announce
gillespie
death
to
his
sons
naturally
would
like
the
satisfaction
of
telling
them
that
his
murderer
has
been
found
i
have
no
doubt
that
george
and
his
brother
are
to
be
found
above
they
be
sir
they
be
spoke
up
a
voice
sweetwater
whose
divination
of
my
wishes
struck
me
as
remarkable
stepped
aside
at
this
and
waiting
for
me
to
pass
him
followed
me
to
the
floor
above
with
a
step
so
light
he
seemed
to
be
buoyed
up
by
wings
as
on
a
former
memorable
occasion
i
stopped
at
george
door
first
the
knock
i
gave
was
followed
by
a
rather
surly
invitation
to
enter
excusing
his
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
his
visitors
of
late
had
not
been
entirely
those
of
his
own
choice
and
consequently
far
from
welcome
i
pushed
open
the
door
without
any
other
exhibition
of
feeling
than
an
apologetic
smile
a
scene
of
disorder
confronted
me
the
disorder
of
an
idle
man
who
feels
that
with
the
withdrawal
of
all
women
from
the
house
he
had
lost
all
incentive
to
neatness
perhaps
to
decency
in
its
midst
and
lolling
on
a
table
over
which
lay
spread
some
cards
he
was
pushing
about
with
idle
fingers
sat
george
much
the
worse
for
liquor
and
by
just
that
much
short
of
being
the
handsome
man
he
was
intended
to
be
by
nature
at
sight
of
me
he
rose
and
propping
himself
forward
on
the
table
looked
the
inquiry
he
was
probably
unable
to
formulate
in
words
i
answered
as
if
he
had
spoken
you
must
pardon
my
intrusion
gillespie
i
have
come
to
bring
you
very
good
news
what
news
news
of
your
brother
speedy
release
news
of
your
murderer
who
though
an
inmate
of
his
house
does
not
bear
the
name
of
gillespie
it
is
your
butler
hewson
with
a
shout
he
threw
out
his
hands
and
then
sank
panting
and
with
drooped
head
into
the
chair
mercifully
at
hand
to
receive
him
i
have
always
sworn
that
leighton
was
innocent
he
cried
out
with
unexpected
vehemence
in
public
and
private
declared
that
he
could
no
more
have
done
that
thing
sweetwater
slipped
from
the
room
and
i
quietly
followed
shutting
the
door
softly
behind
me
we
went
directly
above
and
this
time
found
the
room
we
wished
to
visit
open
as
the
face
of
its
natural
occupant
could
be
plainly
seen
from
where
we
stood
we
gratified
our
curiosity
by
a
momentary
contemplation
of
it
like
his
brother
alfred
gillespie
was
sitting
at
a
table
but
he
was
neither
flushed
with
wine
nor
engaged
in
idle
revery
on
the
contrary
he
was
very
busy
writing
letters
but
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
work
he
looked
restless
and
disturbed
and
in
the
minute
or
two
we
stood
there
watching
him
tore
up
the
wretched
scrawls
he
had
just
indited
with
a
groan
indicative
not
only
of
impatience
but
deep
almost
heartrending
anguish
on
his
pale
brow
and
in
his
attenuated
frame
few
signs
remained
of
the
once
luxurious
alfred
and
when
after
a
second
attempt
at
expressing
himself
he
made
a
dash
at
the
unfinished
letter
and
crumpling
it
to
nothing
in
his
hand
threw
it
into
the
fire
i
turned
to
sweetwater
and
whispered
cut
this
misery
short
the
young
detective
nodded
and
with
a
clearing
of
his
throat
meant
i
am
sure
as
a
warning
he
advanced
and
entered
the
room
into
which
i
rapidly
followed
him
without
pausing
for
any
greeting
from
the
astonished
alfred
he
at
once
presented
me
in
the
following
manner
gillespie
will
you
allow
me
the
honour
of
presenting
outhwaite
who
has
come
to
offer
you
his
hearty
congratulations
congratulations
i
do
know
whether
i
was
more
moved
by
the
sarcasm
or
the
despair
expressed
in
this
repetition
of
the
word
which
must
have
fallen
with
strange
effect
on
alfred
gillespie
ear
for
what
may
i
ask
for
the
speedy
lifting
of
the
cloud
which
has
darkened
this
house
for
the
free
and
honourable
return
of
your
brother
from
his
present
place
of
detention
and
the
incarceration
in
his
stead
of
the
old
man
hewson
who
has
just
confessed
to
the
crime
of
having
poisoned
your
father
hewson
old
hewson
alfred
rose
with
a
wild
laugh
that
was
not
unlike
a
curse
you
are
playing
with
me
you
are
no
i
interposed
with
a
decision
he
could
not
but
recognise
far
from
it
gillespie
what
the
detective
says
is
true
hewson
acknowledges
the
whole
thing
he
wanted
a
little
home
knew
that
a
legacy
awaited
him
at
your
father
death
and
wished
to
hasten
his
enjoyment
of
it
your
father
recognised
him
as
his
poisoner
when
too
late
he
tried
to
communicate
the
fact
to
miss
meredith
in
the
five
words
of
my
sons
hewson
but
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
only
succeeded
in
impressing
on
the
paper
the
unfinished
words
of
my
sons
the
detective
will
explain
ah
was
his
troubled
response
as
he
sank
back
into
the
seat
from
which
he
had
risen
then
as
he
met
our
eyes
fixed
sympathetically
upon
him
he
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
crying
brokenly
do
look
at
me
do
look
at
me
all
this
misery
and
shame
and
it
was
hewson
oh
hope
hope
we
left
him
it
was
all
we
could
do
as
we
stepped
down
together
into
the
lower
hall
sweetwater
remarked
to
me
with
one
of
his
rare
smiles
if
you
know
of
anyone
to
whom
this
unexpected
clearing
of
the
gillespie
name
will
be
especially
gratifying
you
are
at
liberty
now
to
make
the
good
news
known
i
off
for
police
headquarters
there
to
begin
those
proceedings
which
will
release
leighton
gillespie
in
time
to
meet
the
body
of
his
wife
at
communipaw
xxxiv
it
was
the
shock
later
hewson
made
a
fuller
confession
in
it
he
explained
how
he
first
came
to
meditate
the
crime
which
he
afterwards
carried
out
with
such
diabolic
persistence
he
had
never
indulged
himself
in
dishonest
longings
never
allowed
himself
to
dream
of
any
other
life
than
that
of
daily
work
in
the
household
of
which
he
had
for
so
many
years
been
a
member
until
the
day
he
was
called
into
his
master
study
on
some
errand
or
other
which
led
him
to
the
desk
a
memorandum
was
lying
there
and
as
he
had
his
glasses
on
he
could
not
help
seeing
his
own
name
among
a
list
of
others
with
the
figures
against
it
now
it
was
no
secret
in
the
house
that
his
master
was
at
this
very
time
engaged
in
drawing
up
his
will
indeed
the
lawyer
had
been
there
that
very
morning
consequently
hewson
immediately
drew
the
inference
that
these
figures
represented
the
amount
he
was
to
receive
upon
his
master
death
and
though
at
the
moment
he
experienced
nothing
but
gratitude
for
the
thus
shown
the
knowledge
of
what
he
might
expect
under
certain
circumstances
slowly
roused
in
him
strange
ambitions
and
new
desires
which
afterwards
resolved
themselves
into
longings
which
gave
him
no
rest
day
or
night
the
relief
from
daily
routine
a
little
home
in
a
country
place
where
he
could
raise
vegetables
and
flowers
a
quiet
smoke
in
the
twilight
on
a
porch
all
his
own
all
this
would
be
paradise
to
the
tired
old
man
and
as
he
dwelt
upon
its
charms
he
became
impatient
at
his
master
robust
health
and
began
to
note
the
difference
in
their
years
which
alas
were
entirely
in
his
master
favour
and
to
think
yes
to
think
that
though
it
would
cause
him
regret
naturally
so
to
see
that
master
health
give
way
it
would
not
be
so
hard
as
this
endless
counting
of
years
nothing
but
disease
could
annul
that
in
short
a
lifetime
of
service
devoted
to
gillespie
and
his
sons
had
become
as
nothing
in
the
light
of
his
new
desires
and
when
the
usually
healthy
broker
was
finally
seized
with
some
complaint
which
laid
him
on
his
back
these
desires
grew
into
hopes
which
it
was
useless
for
him
to
smother
for
he
was
now
determined
to
have
his
little
fortune
whether
or
no
and
have
it
before
he
was
himself
too
old
to
miss
its
full
enjoyment
meanwhile
he
was
much
in
the
confidence
of
the
family
he
heard
his
master
symptoms
discussed
and
learned
while
waiting
on
table
that
gillespie
was
being
given
small
doses
of
a
certain
poison
as
medicine
doses
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
increase
he
could
go
through
all
his
duties
with
the
utmost
precision
without
ceasing
to
take
in
such
a
conversation
and
when
in
the
course
of
time
he
heard
that
gillespie
was
improving
and
would
soon
be
quite
well
he
allowed
himself
to
dwell
upon
the
tempter
whispered
suggestion
that
three
more
little
drops
from
a
bottle
constantly
in
use
by
his
master
bedside
would
remedy
all
this
and
in
a
safe
and
seemingly
natural
way
end
the
one
existence
which
stood
between
him
and
the
money
he
now
regarded
as
his
own
the
carrying
out
of
this
thought
was
easy
he
knew
that
his
master
was
now
well
enough
to
be
left
alone
at
night
likewise
to
help
himself
to
his
own
medicine
after
it
was
once
prepared
for
him
one
had
only
to
steal
into
the
room
in
the
early
hours
of
the
night
and
with
careful
manipulation
of
bottle
and
glass
increase
that
dose
before
the
time
came
for
the
sick
man
to
want
it
hewson
was
accustomed
to
noiseless
actions
he
could
even
handle
glass
without
a
sound
having
been
trained
in
quiet
ways
by
the
very
man
who
in
such
an
unexpected
manner
was
now
destined
to
fall
a
victim
to
these
very
precautions
he
therefore
did
not
fear
waking
gillespie
he
only
feared
finding
him
already
awake
but
even
this
possibility
lost
its
terrors
when
he
considered
that
to
make
himself
quite
safe
he
had
but
to
utter
the
with
which
the
young
gentlemen
were
accustomed
to
approach
the
at
night
if
gillespie
heard
and
answered
he
would
know
the
moment
badly
chosen
and
steal
away
while
if
no
answer
came
he
had
but
to
proceed
as
the
devil
and
his
own
dark
instincts
prompted
night
came
and
he
went
through
his
part
as
he
supposed
successfully
but
in
the
morning
he
missed
the
alarm
he
had
a
right
to
expect
and
soon
learned
that
gillespie
had
accidentally
overthrown
the
glass
of
medicine
which
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
for
him
worse
than
this
he
saw
the
bottle
of
poison
emptied
clean
out
and
heard
that
gillespie
medicine
was
to
be
changed
to
one
quite
harmless
what
did
this
mean
and
how
could
he
now
hope
to
carry
out
the
scheme
he
was
more
than
ever
resolved
upon
for
a
while
he
felt
quite
discouraged
and
drooped
a
little
over
his
work
which
was
becoming
hourly
more
irksome
he
began
to
hate
the
man
who
had
upset
the
glass
which
if
drank
would
have
insured
him
an
immediate
enjoyment
of
his
little
fortune
and
even
to
cherish
the
same
feeling
towards
gillespie
three
sons
to
whose
wants
he
catered
and
who
were
all
young
enough
to
wait
for
their
fortunes
while
he
now
nearly
could
not
that
is
he
hated
the
two
eldest
but
alfred
well
he
did
quite
hate
alfred
indeed
he
almost
loved
him
loved
him
well
enough
to
be
glad
that
he
as
well
as
himself
would
profit
by
the
old
man
death
if
only
some
new
way
could
be
found
of
bringing
it
safely
about
meanwhile
he
found
as
many
errands
to
his
master
rooms
as
possible
especially
when
the
doctor
was
there
and
being
regarded
as
a
piece
of
household
furniture
rather
than
a
living
breathing
and
determined
man
these
two
rarely
made
an
end
to
their
talk
or
changed
their
topic
on
account
of
his
presence
and
so
it
was
he
heard
them
often
discuss
poisons
and
was
able
to
gather
up
one
or
two
items
in
regard
to
these
dangerous
drugs
which
otherwise
he
might
have
missed
among
other
things
he
learned
that
an
acid
smelling
like
bitter
almonds
killed
quickly
and
without
much
pain
but
he
failed
to
take
in
that
this
very
smell
was
calculated
to
give
away
its
presence
brooding
over
this
happy
discovery
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
how
he
could
prepare
a
drink
likely
to
please
his
master
without
awakening
his
distrust
for
weeks
he
thought
it
over
testing
and
trying
various
concoctions
finally
he
hit
on
one
which
he
prepared
under
gillespie
eye
and
partially
under
his
directions
and
which
was
so
strongly
spiced
that
his
master
did
not
detect
or
at
least
made
no
objection
to
the
flavouring
of
bitter
almonds
which
he
was
careful
to
put
into
it
indeed
gillespie
grew
to
like
it
and
for
a
reason
now
readily
to
be
understood
seemed
to
prefer
anything
brought
him
by
his
old
servant
to
the
finest
of
wines
poured
out
for
him
by
his
sons
having
thus
provided
a
means
for
disguising
the
poison
when
the
opportunity
came
for
administering
it
he
cast
about
how
he
could
procure
the
necessary
drug
without
risk
to
himself
ignorant
as
he
was
in
most
matters
he
knew
that
he
could
not
walk
into
a
and
buy
so
deadly
a
poison
without
rousing
suspicion
so
as
i
have
said
before
he
waited
but
not
long
will
begets
way
or
truer
yet
the
devil
prepares
the
way
for
him
who
is
willing
to
walk
in
it
one
morning
he
came
upon
a
phial
in
leighton
room
whose
very
appearance
strangely
affected
him
it
was
small
it
held
a
dark
liquid
and
it
had
a
wicked
look
strangely
attractive
to
him
he
took
the
phial
up
he
smelt
it
bitter
almonds
greatly
excited
and
somewhat
shaken
he
set
it
down
again
how
had
leighton
come
by
this
what
did
he
want
of
it
and
why
was
it
left
standing
in
this
open
way
on
his
bureau
was
it
for
medicinal
purposes
like
the
other
probably
but
it
seemed
stronger
very
strong
indeed
it
seemed
strong
enough
to
kill
a
man
catching
it
up
he
carried
it
away
if
any
inquiries
are
made
i
say
i
knocked
it
over
and
broke
it
but
hewson
did
think
any
inquiries
would
be
made
sudden
death
would
make
all
such
little
matters
forgotten
having
in
this
unexpected
way
secured
the
very
poison
he
most
desired
hewson
poured
into
the
sink
all
but
the
few
drops
he
had
heard
constituted
a
fatal
dose
then
he
put
the
phial
away
in
a
and
waited
his
opportunity
it
was
not
long
in
coming
that
evening
he
prepared
the
drink
as
usual
for
gillespie
and
while
waiting
for
that
gentleman
to
call
for
it
saw
george
come
into
the
and
take
away
the
bottle
of
sherry
and
afterwards
alfred
who
hunted
about
for
his
pencil
later
he
heard
leighton
come
downstairs
but
he
did
not
wait
to
see
what
that
gentleman
wanted
for
his
own
work
in
the
butler
pantry
was
now
done
and
he
thought
it
better
to
show
himself
in
the
kitchen
but
he
was
suddenly
called
up
by
the
bell
leighton
wished
a
glass
of
sherry
for
his
father
this
was
an
unexpected
order
and
for
the
moment
set
him
quite
aback
for
if
gillespie
drank
sherry
now
he
would
not
want
his
spiced
drink
later
however
he
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
got
out
the
wine
which
he
handed
to
leighton
who
poured
out
a
glassful
and
carried
it
in
to
his
father
a
moment
later
he
heard
the
front
door
close
leighton
had
gone
out
to
one
of
his
numerous
meetings
and
gillespie
was
left
alone
somehow
the
old
servant
had
an
irresistible
desire
to
see
how
his
master
looked
at
this
moment
there
had
been
loud
words
between
that
master
and
leighton
before
the
latter
had
left
and
he
wanted
to
see
how
his
master
had
borne
it
wanted
to
see
well
he
hardly
knew
what
but
he
went
to
the
door
and
finding
the
opposite
one
open
peered
in
gillespie
was
standing
just
where
his
son
had
doubtless
left
him
gazing
intently
into
the
which
he
held
untasted
in
his
hand
his
face
was
wan
and
troubled
suddenly
he
moved
and
glancing
behind
him
like
a
man
bound
on
some
guilty
errand
but
not
looking
far
enough
into
the
distance
to
see
hewson
watching
him
from
the
depths
of
the
dimly
lighted
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
he
hurried
to
the
window
and
raising
first
the
shade
and
then
the
sash
flung
out
the
contents
of
the
glass
into
the
this
done
he
uttered
a
sigh
which
spoke
of
some
great
inward
trouble
and
reclosing
the
window
carried
back
the
empty
glass
to
the
from
which
hewson
had
by
this
time
slipped
in
guilty
confusion
not
understanding
gillespie
sudden
distaste
for
the
wine
he
had
ordered
but
determined
to
profit
by
what
struck
him
as
a
very
happy
chance
hewson
put
his
own
concoction
on
a
tray
and
creeping
to
the
buffet
took
the
phial
out
of
the
in
which
he
had
concealed
it
and
emptied
its
contents
into
the
glass
he
carried
then
not
liking
to
put
the
phial
back
he
thrust
it
into
his
mouth
up
the
cork
having
slipped
from
his
hand
and
rolled
away
in
the
darkness
he
was
willing
to
be
heard
now
and
was
stepping
briskly
around
the
room
when
gillespie
called
out
who
that
is
it
hewson
it
is
sir
was
the
demure
reply
i
came
up
to
make
you
that
drink
you
like
so
well
but
leighton
said
you
preferred
sherry
yes
yes
but
i
like
your
drink
too
brew
it
and
bring
it
in
to
me
i
seem
to
be
unusually
thirsty
without
a
quiver
without
a
conscious
sense
of
doing
anything
greatly
out
of
the
common
this
tried
old
servant
brought
him
the
glass
which
he
knew
would
end
all
earthly
relations
between
them
he
even
waited
until
he
saw
it
emptied
then
he
took
it
out
again
and
immediately
washed
it
why
he
felt
this
precaution
necessary
he
hardly
knew
unless
it
was
to
pass
away
the
moment
of
suspense
he
never
dreamed
for
a
minute
that
there
was
anything
special
for
him
to
fear
were
not
men
dropping
dead
every
day
in
or
in
the
streets
and
why
not
this
man
that
the
police
would
be
called
in
or
that
so
quiet
a
death
would
be
treated
as
a
crime
had
never
occurred
to
him
he
had
never
read
murder
cases
much
indeed
had
never
read
anything
much
he
only
knew
he
wanted
his
master
to
die
and
that
the
quickest
way
to
bring
this
about
was
to
give
him
a
dose
of
very
strong
poison
yet
after
he
had
done
this
he
felt
some
nervousness
not
over
what
he
had
done
but
its
seemingly
slow
results
he
had
expected
gillespie
to
fall
at
once
perhaps
before
he
was
himself
well
out
of
the
room
and
gillespie
did
not
fall
hewson
had
had
time
to
wash
the
glass
put
it
away
go
down
into
the
kitchen
again
and
come
back
without
hearing
the
heavy
thud
for
which
his
ears
were
strained
was
his
affair
to
fail
again
had
the
dark
and
pungent
liquor
been
harmless
and
was
it
decreed
that
he
was
to
go
back
to
the
old
life
with
no
hopes
of
a
change
or
relief
he
was
so
worked
up
by
this
thought
that
he
crept
into
the
again
and
was
making
for
the
hall
door
to
take
another
peep
into
the
study
when
his
foot
encountered
a
small
object
on
the
floor
yielding
to
his
usual
methodical
habits
he
stooped
and
picked
up
what
proved
to
be
alfred
pencil
this
he
mechanically
dropped
into
his
pocket
then
he
went
on
he
found
his
master
reeling
over
the
study
floor
in
the
first
consciousness
perhaps
of
his
alarming
condition
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
the
door
but
as
hewson
drew
nearer
fascinated
perhaps
by
the
sight
of
suffering
of
which
he
himself
had
been
the
cause
gillespie
suddenly
paused
in
this
effort
and
meeting
hewson
eyes
threw
up
his
arms
and
made
for
his
desk
upon
which
he
fell
in
a
way
which
assured
his
anxious
watcher
that
the
last
minutes
of
his
quondam
master
were
at
hand
a
footnote
a
it
was
at
this
moment
probably
and
not
till
this
moment
that
gillespie
recognized
his
real
murderer
of
the
tumult
thus
awakened
in
heart
and
brain
who
can
judge
as
he
had
no
wish
to
watch
his
sufferings
he
made
another
journey
downstairs
and
showed
himself
in
the
servants
hall
just
as
little
claire
broke
away
from
her
nurse
and
rushed
laughing
loudly
up
to
her
grandfather
this
convinced
him
that
his
own
comings
and
goings
had
been
so
natural
that
they
had
not
even
been
noticed
by
his
he
saw
that
they
had
been
playing
a
merry
game
with
the
child
and
that
not
one
of
them
had
had
an
eye
for
him
or
his
unaccustomed
nervousness
this
gave
him
courage
and
soon
very
soon
now
they
all
had
reason
for
nervousness
the
alarm
was
heard
at
last
strangers
came
into
the
house
the
police
followed
and
this
old
reprobate
who
had
remained
serene
amidst
all
the
turmoil
realised
that
there
was
more
to
fear
in
the
matter
than
had
ever
struck
his
mind
with
this
fear
came
not
only
a
desire
to
hide
his
own
guilt
but
the
requisite
cunning
for
doing
so
he
realised
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
phial
before
he
was
searched
and
being
left
a
minute
to
himself
in
the
he
took
it
out
of
his
side
and
shaking
out
the
pencil
which
had
slipped
into
it
he
thrust
it
under
the
clock
as
being
the
one
article
not
likely
to
be
moved
it
was
a
heavy
lift
for
his
old
arms
and
his
elbows
shook
as
he
guided
it
back
into
place
the
consequence
was
that
he
knocked
over
the
glass
which
gillespie
had
set
down
on
the
a
few
minutes
before
but
though
the
clatter
which
it
made
attracted
attention
and
the
broken
pieces
of
this
glass
were
carefully
examined
nothing
was
discovered
from
them
the
glass
having
held
nothing
but
sherry
not
so
with
poor
pencil
the
end
of
which
had
rested
in
the
last
drop
of
poison
remaining
in
the
phial
the
odour
of
prussic
acid
thus
communicated
to
it
came
near
bringing
his
favourite
young
master
into
jeopardy
but
something
hewson
hardly
knew
what
intervened
to
save
him
and
all
was
going
on
well
or
as
well
as
could
be
expected
after
the
suspicions
expressed
by
gillespie
against
his
sons
when
this
young
demon
in
the
shape
of
a
detective
flung
himself
at
the
old
butler
throat
and
without
telling
him
why
or
by
what
means
he
had
learned
it
accused
him
of
being
his
master
poisoner
it
was
the
shock
the
shock
the
miserable
wretch
wailed
out
had
i
had
more
time
to
think
i
would
have
known
that
he
had
no
proof
against
me
that
it
was
all
and
that
i
would
be
a
fool
to
fear
that
but
it
is
too
late
now
i
have
said
it
and
i
stand
by
it
only
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
the
thousand
dollars
for
which
i
killed
my
master
lying
for
one
instant
in
my
hand
i
would
willingly
go
without
the
cottage
go
without
the
evening
pipe
in
the
sight
of
hills
and
meadows
just
to
realise
the
sensation
of
holding
all
that
money
and
knowing
that
it
was
xxxv
roses
one
more
scene
and
this
narration
of
my
life
most
stirring
episode
will
have
reached
its
conclusion
it
was
a
memorable
scene
to
me
it
took
place
in
the
parlours
of
the
little
cottage
in
new
jersey
on
the
day
we
laid
away
to
rest
the
burial
had
taken
place
the
guests
had
departed
and
only
the
members
of
the
family
remained
to
close
up
the
cottage
now
more
than
ever
precious
in
leighton
eyes
george
and
alfred
with
an
assumption
of
brotherly
feeling
they
probably
thought
due
the
occasion
had
stepped
out
together
to
see
that
everything
was
ready
for
hope
departure
and
from
the
window
where
i
stood
i
could
see
arrant
spy
that
i
was
the
nonchalant
air
with
which
either
turned
a
wary
eye
upon
the
other
as
hope
voice
was
heard
above
speaking
to
little
claire
they
evidently
still
looked
upon
each
other
as
the
possible
object
of
her
preference
no
suspicion
having
reached
them
of
the
tragic
secret
which
had
made
this
young
girl
heart
inaccessible
to
them
both
i
who
knew
it
and
had
my
own
place
in
the
tragedy
to
which
they
had
been
blind
did
not
watch
them
long
leighton
being
the
more
interesting
figure
at
that
moment
as
standing
on
his
desolate
hearthstone
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
wander
for
the
last
time
perhaps
over
the
beauties
of
the
bijou
dwelling
which
exquisite
as
it
was
had
been
as
powerless
as
his
love
to
hold
his
roving
wife
in
check
he
was
waiting
for
hope
and
as
this
thought
with
its
suggestion
of
another
and
longer
waiting
struck
my
mind
a
pang
seized
me
which
it
took
all
my
to
hide
waiting
for
hope
hope
who
had
sat
that
day
with
his
child
crushed
close
against
her
breast
and
a
look
on
her
face
which
angels
might
view
with
pity
but
which
i
ah
she
was
coming
i
turned
my
face
away
not
that
i
had
anything
to
dread
from
this
meeting
but
that
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
bear
at
this
moment
to
see
the
shadow
veiling
his
melancholy
countenance
lift
were
it
ever
so
lightly
at
the
sound
of
the
step
that
was
shaking
my
own
heart
but
i
immediately
glanced
back
uncertainty
was
worse
than
knowledge
and
glancing
back
saw
hope
and
hope
only
she
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
with
her
arms
full
of
roses
roses
which
she
had
brought
from
new
york
and
which
she
now
held
out
towards
leighton
with
a
smile
i
hardly
think
he
saw
so
much
was
his
attention
fixed
upon
the
flowers
what
are
these
for
he
asked
advancing
towards
her
and
touching
the
great
roses
with
a
trembling
hand
they
are
for
her
said
hope
in
a
low
tone
for
my
cousin
millicent
i
could
not
bear
to
have
her
lie
with
only
her
tokens
on
her
breast
as
if
she
had
no
no
he
caught
her
to
his
heart
moved
to
the
very
soul
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
then
he
took
the
flowers
as
he
passed
out
she
tottered
pale
and
almost
swooning
to
where
i
stood
trembling
with
my
own
emotions
lifting
her
face
with
its
candid
eyes
and
quivering
lips
she
faltered
between
her
sobs
have
patience
with
me
i
see
now
that
he
has
never
loved
me
and
never
will
had
so
