epilogue
introduction
the
enemy
passed
beneath
our
window
and
then
out
of
view
a
moment
afterwards
we
heard
the
sound
as
it
were
of
a
hurricane
the
house
trembled
to
the
gallop
of
horses
at
the
end
of
the
street
the
enemy
had
been
charged
by
our
cavalry
and
not
knowing
our
small
numbers
they
were
returning
at
full
speed
hotly
pursued
by
our
men
they
all
passed
by
a
whirlwind
of
smoke
and
noise
our
soldiers
fired
and
slashed
away
the
enemy
on
their
side
fired
as
they
fled
two
or
three
bullets
struck
the
house
one
of
them
shattering
a
bar
of
the
through
which
i
was
looking
on
the
spectacle
was
at
once
magnificent
and
terrible
pursued
too
closely
the
enemy
had
decided
to
face
about
and
there
twenty
paces
from
us
was
going
on
a
combat
life
for
life
i
saw
five
or
six
of
the
enemy
fall
and
two
or
three
of
our
men
then
defeated
after
a
ten
minutes
struggle
the
enemy
trusted
themselves
again
to
the
swiftness
of
their
horses
and
cleared
off
at
full
gallop
the
pursuit
recommenced
the
whirlwind
resumed
its
course
leaving
before
it
disappeared
three
or
four
men
strewn
on
the
pavement
suddenly
we
heard
the
drum
beating
to
the
charge
it
was
our
hundred
infantry
soldiers
who
were
coming
up
in
their
turn
they
marched
with
fixed
bayonets
and
disappeared
at
the
bend
of
the
road
five
minutes
later
we
heard
a
sharp
platoon
firing
then
we
saw
our
hussars
reappearing
driven
by
five
or
six
hundred
cavalry
they
reappeared
the
pursued
as
they
had
started
the
pursuers
amid
this
second
tempest
of
men
it
was
impossible
to
see
or
distinguish
anything
only
when
it
was
past
three
or
four
dead
bodies
more
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
the
boy
who
saw
these
scenes
to
record
them
in
his
memoirs
many
years
later
was
living
with
his
mother
at
on
the
soissons
road
in
the
aisne
where
fierce
fighting
between
our
little
army
and
our
allies
the
french
on
the
one
hand
and
the
germans
on
the
other
is
taking
place
as
these
lines
are
being
written
the
time
was
napoleon
had
retreated
from
moscow
and
had
lost
the
battle
of
leipzig
and
the
russians
prussians
and
austrians
in
alliance
were
gradually
closing
in
on
france
all
confidence
in
napoleon
star
had
disappeared
every
hour
was
bringing
the
roar
of
cannon
nearer
to
paris
in
a
few
days
the
allies
were
to
enter
it
and
napoleon
to
sign
the
decree
of
abdication
and
leave
for
elba
the
name
of
the
boy
was
alexandre
dumas
his
mother
had
filled
her
cellar
with
furniture
bedding
and
household
goods
and
had
then
had
a
new
plank
floor
made
for
the
room
above
so
that
treasure
seekers
might
look
in
vain
and
had
buried
her
little
store
of
money
in
a
box
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
she
was
as
much
in
terror
of
napoleon
as
she
was
of
the
prussian
and
russian
troops
if
her
own
countrymen
the
french
were
beaten
she
and
her
son
might
be
killed
but
if
napoleon
was
victorious
he
would
want
her
son
as
a
soldier
now
alexandre
was
twelve
and
conscription
began
at
sixteen
the
boy
father
general
alexandre
dumas
was
dead
and
as
on
account
of
his
republican
principles
the
first
consul
had
disgraced
exiled
and
ruined
him
so
by
the
emperor
the
widow
and
her
son
were
disowned
forgotten
and
left
to
starve
in
spite
of
this
madame
dumas
neighbours
called
her
a
bonapartist
her
husband
having
fought
under
bonaparte
and
the
term
bonapartist
was
one
which
was
presently
to
amount
to
an
accusation
as
louis
xviii
neared
the
throne
the
enemy
seen
by
the
boy
fighting
in
the
street
were
prussians
prussians
long
expected
by
his
mother
who
had
made
three
successive
enormous
dishes
of
haricot
mutton
for
their
pacification
although
young
alexandre
had
partaken
of
the
mutton
and
thought
very
little
of
the
threatened
danger
before
it
occurred
he
never
forgot
the
sudden
prussian
inroad
and
the
dead
men
left
outside
this
door
and
he
often
said
that
the
valley
of
the
aisne
might
see
the
prussians
again
in
when
a
candidate
for
the
chamber
of
deputies
dumas
lost
many
votes
by
making
a
speech
in
the
course
of
which
when
passing
the
state
of
europe
in
review
he
said
geographically
prussia
has
the
shape
of
a
serpent
and
like
a
serpent
it
seems
always
to
sleep
and
prepare
to
swallow
everything
around
it
denmark
holland
and
belgium
and
when
it
has
engulfed
them
all
you
will
see
that
austria
will
pass
in
its
turn
and
perhaps
alas
france
also
in
june
prussia
rapid
campaign
against
austria
startled
europe
every
thoughtful
man
was
calculating
the
consequences
of
the
preponderance
of
prussia
in
germany
and
dumas
was
one
of
those
frenchmen
who
were
seized
with
sad
presentiments
of
the
future
for
their
own
country
particularly
does
he
appear
to
have
been
struck
with
the
barbarous
conduct
of
the
prussians
in
the
free
city
of
frankfort
which
the
newspapers
were
daily
reporting
unable
to
remain
at
home
while
such
events
were
occurring
he
travelled
to
frankfort
and
observed
them
for
himself
then
he
went
to
gotha
hanover
and
berlin
he
visited
the
battlefields
of
langensalza
and
sadowa
and
returned
to
paris
with
his
notebooks
crammed
with
precious
details
his
pockets
bulging
with
unpublished
documents
then
hollander
the
owner
of
the
political
journal
the
situation
came
running
to
the
author
of
the
three
musketeers
queen
margot
and
of
so
many
other
famous
historical
romances
to
ask
for
one
to
be
called
the
prussian
terror
dumas
who
like
hollander
was
anxious
to
do
all
he
could
to
arouse
france
fast
crumbling
under
the
second
empire
to
a
sense
of
her
danger
from
prussia
gladly
complied
such
is
the
genesis
of
this
book
in
which
on
every
page
the
author
seems
to
say
awake
the
danger
is
at
hand
to
render
it
more
easily
intelligible
to
readers
of
the
present
day
who
appear
to
us
to
know
very
little
of
the
war
of
let
us
glance
at
the
important
events
which
the
newspaper
proprietor
and
the
historical
romancer
had
in
mind
the
death
of
the
king
of
denmark
occurred
in
and
north
germany
buzzed
like
a
swarm
of
angry
bees
over
the
duchies
of
schleswig
holstein
and
luxemburg
by
the
treaty
of
london
which
fixed
the
succession
to
the
danish
crown
austria
and
prussia
although
signatories
to
it
denied
the
right
of
the
new
king
to
those
duchies
and
claimed
them
as
part
of
germany
in
february
austrian
and
prussian
troops
crossed
the
danish
border
the
danes
fought
well
but
were
forced
to
submit
and
eventually
the
duchies
were
made
over
to
their
enemies
then
prussia
which
had
long
looked
with
jealousy
on
the
power
of
austria
and
considered
a
war
with
her
inevitable
sooner
or
later
opposed
her
desire
to
form
the
duchies
into
a
separate
state
under
the
duke
of
augustenburg
austria
referred
the
matter
to
the
frankfort
diet
which
decided
in
favour
of
the
duke
but
bismarck
as
prussia
prime
minister
to
secure
the
complete
control
of
north
germany
required
that
not
only
the
duchies
but
the
whole
of
hanover
hesse
cassel
hesse
nassau
and
the
city
of
frankfort
should
be
absorbed
in
prussia
both
prussia
and
austria
prepared
for
war
prussia
entering
into
an
alliance
with
victor
emanuel
on
june
prussian
troops
entered
holstein
on
june
in
regard
to
the
decisive
question
whether
the
federal
army
should
be
mobilized
hanover
voted
in
the
diet
with
austria
and
by
so
doing
irrevocably
declared
on
which
side
she
would
range
herself
in
the
approaching
struggle
prussia
at
once
issued
an
ultimatum
to
hanover
requesting
her
to
maintain
neutrality
and
to
accept
her
scheme
for
the
reformation
of
the
confederation
hanover
immediately
rejected
these
demands
and
prussian
troops
at
once
crossed
the
frontier
the
resulting
battles
are
known
as
those
of
langensalza
and
aschaffenburg
the
austrians
were
disastrously
defeated
in
the
terrific
battle
of
sadowa
or
königsrätz
and
bismarck
was
thus
nearer
to
the
formation
of
german
unity
under
prussia
after
sadowa
the
first
act
of
the
prussians
was
to
enter
the
free
city
of
frankfort
which
did
not
attempt
any
defence
relying
as
it
did
on
its
treaties
and
terrorise
its
inhabitants
it
was
these
acts
of
terror
then
of
which
hollander
and
dumas
were
particularly
thinking
hoping
that
the
recital
of
them
in
a
popular
romance
would
do
something
to
awaken
france
it
has
been
repeatedly
stated
that
before
the
war
of
the
german
soldiers
were
guiltless
of
acts
of
atrocity
this
story
proves
the
contrary
and
it
is
not
a
little
curious
that
no
work
in
the
english
language
save
books
of
reference
covering
the
ground
traversed
by
the
prussian
terror
appears
to
be
now
accessible
for
this
reason
alone
dumas
book
which
though
in
story
form
is
an
authoritative
contribution
to
history
deserves
attention
at
the
present
time
apart
from
this
it
is
so
spirited
and
interesting
that
it
is
quite
surprising
that
at
so
late
a
date
years
after
its
original
issue
i
should
be
the
first
to
offer
a
version
to
the
british
public
dumas
was
still
living
in
paris
when
in
the
summer
of
war
was
declared
with
germany
his
health
was
now
bad
and
his
son
the
author
of
la
dame
aux
camélias
did
not
wish
him
to
remain
during
the
siege
in
the
autumn
he
took
his
father
with
him
to
puys
near
dieppe
where
he
had
a
villa
there
dumas
died
on
december
he
did
not
know
it
news
being
kept
from
him
but
during
his
last
days
his
worst
prognostications
had
been
verified
a
detachment
of
the
prussian
army
was
actually
taking
possession
of
dieppe
as
he
breathed
his
last
while
the
soldiers
marched
along
the
streets
their
bands
playing
german
airs
and
the
inhabitants
hid
in
their
houses
behind
shuttered
windows
the
news
flew
round
the
town
that
the
country
had
lost
alexandre
dumas
the
most
typically
french
writer
who
has
ever
existed
the
coffin
was
borne
to
the
grave
at
neuville
where
the
german
soldiers
were
in
occupation
before
a
prussian
patrol
in
the
body
was
exhumed
and
buried
in
the
family
tomb
at
hard
by
where
as
a
boy
of
twelve
dumas
heard
the
prussian
cannon
three
nations
are
now
fighting
garnett
dumas
knew
frankfort
well
having
lived
there
for
some
time
in
with
gérard
de
nerval
the
author
of
les
filles
de
feu
these
facts
are
taken
from
the
encyclopædia
britannica
it
should
be
stated
that
hollander
who
wished
the
brilliant
name
of
dumas
to
shine
on
as
many
issues
of
his
newspaper
as
possible
stipulated
for
not
less
than
sixty
dumas
complied
but
was
forced
to
include
some
hunting
stories
which
he
puts
into
the
mouth
of
his
hero
benedict
turpin
these
stories
will
not
be
found
in
the
present
volume
the
prussian
terror
chapter
i
berlin
the
architect
of
berlin
appears
to
have
carefully
designed
his
plan
according
to
line
and
rule
in
order
to
produce
a
capital
of
dullness
as
far
removed
from
the
picturesque
as
his
ingenuity
could
accomplish
seen
from
the
cathedral
which
is
the
loftiest
point
attainable
the
place
suggests
an
enormous
on
which
the
royal
palace
the
museum
cathedral
and
other
important
buildings
fairly
represent
kings
queens
and
castles
and
much
as
paris
is
intersected
by
the
seine
so
is
berlin
divided
by
the
spree
except
that
instead
of
surrounding
one
island
as
does
the
former
river
two
artificial
canals
branch
out
right
and
left
like
the
handles
of
a
vase
and
form
two
islands
of
unequal
size
in
the
centre
of
the
town
berlin
being
the
capital
of
privilege
one
of
these
islands
is
distinguished
by
possessing
the
royal
palace
the
cathedral
the
museum
the
bourse
most
other
public
buildings
and
a
score
of
houses
which
in
turin
the
berlin
of
italy
would
certainly
be
called
palaces
the
other
contains
nothing
remarkable
corresponding
to
the
parisian
rue
and
the
quarter
the
aristocratic
the
smart
berlin
lies
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
friedrich
strasse
which
extends
from
the
place
de
la
belle
alliance
by
which
one
enters
berlin
to
that
of
oranienburg
by
which
one
leaves
it
and
which
is
crossed
nearly
in
the
middle
by
the
unter
den
linden
this
famous
promenade
traverses
the
fashionable
quarter
and
extends
from
the
royal
palace
to
the
place
it
owes
its
name
to
two
rows
of
magnificent
lime
trees
which
form
a
charming
promenade
on
each
side
of
the
broad
both
sides
abound
in
cafés
and
restaurants
whose
crowds
of
customers
overflowing
in
summer
on
to
the
public
road
cause
a
considerable
amount
of
lively
motion
this
however
never
rises
into
noisy
or
clamour
for
the
prussian
prefers
to
amuse
himself
and
keeps
his
gaiety
within
doors
but
on
june
as
beautiful
a
day
as
prussia
can
produce
unter
den
linden
at
about
six
in
the
evening
presented
a
scene
of
most
unusual
commotion
the
excitement
was
caused
in
the
first
place
by
the
increasingly
hostile
attitude
assumed
by
prussia
towards
austria
in
refusing
to
allow
the
states
of
holstein
to
proceed
to
the
election
of
the
duke
of
augustenburg
also
by
the
general
arming
on
all
sides
by
reports
concerning
the
immediate
calling
up
of
the
landwehr
and
the
dissolution
of
the
chamber
and
finally
by
rumours
of
telegrams
from
france
containing
threats
against
prussia
said
to
have
been
made
by
louis
napoleon
himself
it
is
necessary
to
travel
in
prussia
before
one
can
in
the
least
comprehend
the
sort
of
hatred
therein
cherished
against
the
french
it
is
a
species
of
monomania
which
distorts
even
the
very
clearest
vision
no
minister
can
be
popular
no
orator
will
gain
a
hearing
unless
the
one
lets
it
be
supposed
his
policy
is
for
war
and
the
other
can
produce
some
brilliant
epigram
or
clever
levelled
against
france
nor
will
the
title
of
poet
be
allowed
unless
the
claimant
can
qualify
by
being
the
author
of
some
popular
rhyme
entitled
the
rhine
leipzig
or
waterloo
whence
comes
this
hatred
for
france
a
deep
inveterate
indestructible
hatred
which
seems
to
pervade
the
very
earth
and
air
it
is
impossible
to
say
can
it
date
from
the
time
when
a
legion
from
gaul
the
advanced
guard
of
the
roman
army
first
entered
germany
abandoning
this
idea
we
come
down
to
the
battle
of
rosbach
as
a
possible
cause
in
which
case
the
german
national
character
must
be
an
uncommonly
bad
one
seeing
they
beat
us
there
still
later
it
might
possibly
be
explained
by
the
military
inferiority
shown
by
the
pupils
of
frederic
the
great
ever
since
the

of

threatening
that
not
one
stone
of

should
be

that

from

in
and
another
that
of
jena
opened
the
gates
of
berlin
to
us
in
still
to
these
dates
our
enemies
no
our
rivals
can
oppose
the
names
of
leipzig
and
of
waterloo
of
leipzig
however
they
can
not
claim
more
than
a
quarter
seeing
their
army
was
combined
with
those
of
russia
austria
and
sweden
to
say
nothing
of
that
of
saxony
which
also
deserves
to
be
remembered
nor
is
more
than
of
waterloo
to
their
credit
for
napoleon
who
till
then
had
the
advantage
was
already
exhausted
by
a
six
hours
struggle
with
the
english
when
they
arrived
consequently
remembering
this
heritage
of
hate
which
indeed
they
have
always
shown
quite
openly
one
could
not
be
surprised
at
the
popular
emotion
caused
by
a
rumour
but
widely
spread
that
france
would
throw
down
the
gauntlet
and
join
in
the
impending
conflict
many
however
doubted
the
news
as
not
a
word
of
it
had
appeared
in
the
staat
anzeiger
that
morning
berlin
like
paris
has
its
faithful
adherents
to
the
government
and
the
moniteur
who
believe
that
the
latter
can
not
lie
and
that
a
paternal
government
would
never
never
keep
back
news
interesting
to
its
affectionate
subjects
these
were
joined
by
the
readers
of
the
tages
telegraphe
daily
telegraphic
news
certain
that
their
special
organ
would
have
known
whatever
was
to
be
known
and
also
by
those
of
the
ministerial
and
aristocratic
kreuz
zeitung
who
equally
declined
to
believe
anything
not
contained
in
its
usually
columns
and
besides
these
one
heard
the
names
of
a
dozen
other
daily
or
weekly
issues
bandied
from
side
to
side
in
the
excited
crowd
until
suddenly
a
harsh
cry
of
french
news
french
news
telegraphic
news
one
kreutzer
succeeded
in
dominating
the
din
the
effect
produced
on
the
crowd
may
be
imagined
despite
the
proverbial
prussian
economy
every
hand
sought
its
pocket
and
drawing
forth
a
kreutzer
proceeded
to
exchange
it
for
the
square
bit
of
paper
containing
the
news
and
indeed
the
importance
of
the
contents
made
amends
for
the
delay
in
obtaining
it
the
dispatch
ran
as
follows
june
his
majesty
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
having
gone
to
auxerre
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
provincial
assembly
was
met
at
the
gates
of
the
town
by
the
mayor
who
presented
an
address
offering
the
respectful
homage
of
himself
and
the
inhabitants
his
majesty
replied
in
the
following
terms
which
do
not
require
to
be
explained
to
our
countrymen
their
meaning
must
be
sufficiently
clear
to
all
i
see
with
much
pleasure
that
auxerre
still
remembers
the
first
empire
let
me
assure
you
that
i
on
my
side
have
inherited
the
feelings
of
affection
entertained
by
the
chief
of
our
family
for
the
patriotic
and
energetic
communities
which
supported
him
alike
through
good
and
evil
and
i
myself
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
department
of
the
yonne
as
being
one
of
the
first
to
declare
for
me
in
it
knew
as
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
knew
that
its
interests
and
mine
were
identical
and
that
we
both
equally
detested
those
treaties
of
which
are
used
as
a
means
of
controlling
our
external
policy
here
the
dispatch
broke
off
the
sender
evidently
not
considering
the
remainder
of
the
emperor
discourse
worth
transcribing
certainly
his
meaning
was
sufficiently
clear
without
it
nevertheless
some
minutes
elapsed
before
the
sense
of
the
communication
was
understood
by
the
readers
and
evoked
the
display
of
hatred
which
naturally
followed
when
at
last
they
began
to
comprehend
and
to
see
the
hand
of
the
nephew
of
napoleon
the
great
overshadowing
their
beloved
rhine
there
arose
from
one
end
of
unter
den
linden
to
the
other
such
a
tempest
of
threats
howls
and
hurrahs
that
to
borrow
schiller
lively
expression
one
would
have
thought
the
encircling
hoops
of
the
heavenly
concave
must
all
be
burst
asunder
threatening
toasts
were
called
curses
shouted
and
fists
shaken
against
offending
france
a
göttingen
student
springing
on
a
table
began
to
recite
with
due
emphasis
rückert
ferocious
poem
entitled
the
return
in
which
a
prussian
soldier
having
returned
home
in
consequence
of
peace
being
declared
bitterly
regrets
the
various
outrages
he
is
in
consequence
debarred
from
committing
needless
to
say
this
recital
was
enthusiastically
applauded
shouts
of
bravo
and
hurrah
mixed
with
cries
of
long
live
king
william
hurrah
for
prussia
down
with
france
formed
an
accompaniment
which
would
doubtless
have
been
continued
to
the
next
piece
the
reciter
proposing
to
give
a
lyric
by
theodor
körner
the
announcement
was
received
with
loud
applause
it
was
however
by
no
means
the
only
safety
valve
at
which
the
passion
of
the
surging
crowd
now
at
white
heat
sought
and
found
a
vent
a
little
lower
down
at
the
corner
of
the
friedrich
strasse
a
singer
happened
to
be
returning
from
rehearsal
and
as
he
chanced
on
one
occasion
to
have
made
a
hit
by
singing
the
german
rhine
some
one
who
remembered
this
raised
a
cry
of
the
german
rhine
the
german
rhine
heinrich
sing
german
rhine
the
crowd
instantly
recognized
and
surrounded
the
artist
who
owning
a
fine
voice
and
being
familiar
with
the
piece
demanded
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
but
gratified
his
audience
by
singing
his
very
best
thereby
far
surpassing
the
return
in
the
tremendous
reception
he
obtained
but
all
at
once
a
loud
and
furious
hiss
which
might
have
issued
from
the
throttle
of
a
steam
engine
was
heard
above
all
the
wild
applause
and
produced
the
effect
of
a
blow
in
the
face
bestowed
on
the
singer
a
bomb
suddenly
exploding
in
the
crowd
could
hardly
have
been
more
effective
the
hiss
was
answered
by
a
dull
roar
something
like
that
which
precedes
a
hurricane
and
every
eye
was
turned
towards
the
quarter
whence
it
proceeded
standing
by
a
solitary
table
was
a
handsome
young
man
apparently
about
rather
slightly
built
and
in
face
moustache
and
costume
somewhat
resembling
the
portrait
of
vandyke
he
had
just
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
held
a
foaming
glass
aloft
undisturbed
by
angry
looks
and
threatening
gestures
he
drew
himself
up
placed
one
foot
on
his
chair
and
raising
his
glass
above
his
head
cried
loudly
vive
la
france
then
swallowed
the
contents
at
one
draught
chapter
ii
the
house
of
hohenzollern
the
immense
crowd
surrounding
the
young
frenchman
remained
for
a
moment
dumb
with
stupefaction
many
not
understanding
french
failed
to
comprehend
his
meaning
and
others
who
did
understand
appreciating
his
courage
in
thug
braving
a
furious
crowd
surveyed
him
with
more
astonishment
than
anger
others
again
who
realized
that
a
dire
insult
had
been
offered
them
would
nevertheless
with
typical
german
deliberation
have
allowed
him
time
to
escape
had
he
wished
but
the
young
man
demeanour
showed
that
whatever
the
consequences
of
his
bravado
he
intended
to
face
them
presently
a
threatening
murmur
of
franzose
franzose
arose
from
the
crowd
yes
said
he
in
as
good
german
as
might
be
heard
anywhere
between
thionville
and
memel
yes
i
am
french
my
name
is
benedict
turpin
i
have
studied
at
heidelberg
and
might
pass
for
a
german
since
i
can
speak
your
language
as
well
as
most
of
those
here
and
better
than
some
also
i
can
use
a
rapier
pistol
sword
sabre
boxing
gloves
or
any
other
weapon
you
like
to
choose
any
one
wishing
for
satisfaction
may
find
me
at
the
black
eagle
the
young
man
had
hardly
finished
his
audacious
defiance
when
four
men
of
the
lower
class
advanced
upon
him
the
crowd
kept
silence
and
the
contemptuous
words
what
four
to
one
leipzig
again
come
on
i
am
ready
were
distinctly
heard
then
not
waiting
to
be
attacked
the
young
frenchman
sprang
at
the
nearest
and
broke
the
bottle
of
champagne
over
his
head
blinding
him
with
foam
the
second
he
tripped
up
throwing
him
a
good
ten
paces
off
and
disposed
of
the
third
with
a
vigorous
blow
in
the
ribs
which
hurled
him
against
a
chair
then
seizing
the
fourth
by
the
collar
and
grasping
his
waist
he
actually
held
him
aloft
in
the
air
for
a
moment
then
flinging
him
on
the
ground
he
placed
a
foot
on
his
chest
is
not
leipzig
avenged
said
he
then
at
last
the
tempest
burst
a
rush
was
made
for
the
frenchman
but
he
still
keeping
a
foot
on
his
fallen
enemy
seized
a
chair
and
whirled
it
round
him
so
vigorously
that
for
a
moment
the
crowd
was
held
at
bay
and
only
ventured
on
threats
but
the
circle
drew
closer
some
one
grasped
the
chair
and
succeeded
in
stopping
it
a
few
moments
more
and
the
audacious
frenchman
would
probably
have
been
torn
to
pieces
had
not
two
or
three
prussian
officers
intervened
they
forced
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
formed
a
guard
around
the
young
man
one
of
them
addressed
the
crowd
thus
come
come
my
friends
do
murder
a
brave
young
man
because
he
does
not
forget
he
is
a
frenchman
and
has
cried
la
france
he
will
now
cry
guillaume
iv
and
we
will
let
him
off
then
whispering
to
benedict
cry
guillaume
iv
or
i
ca
answer
for
your
life
yes
bawled
the
crowd
let
him
cry
guillaume
iv
vive
la
prusse
and
we
will
let
him
go
very
well
said
benedict
but
i
prefer
to
do
so
freely
and
without
compulsion
leave
me
alone
and
let
me
speak
from
a
table
stand
aside
and
let
him
pass
said
the
officers
releasing
benedict
and
leaving
him
free
he
wishes
to
address
you
let
him
speak
let
him
speak
cried
the
crowd
gentlemen
said
benedict
mounting
the
table
nearest
to
the
open
windows
of
the
café
oblige
me
by
listening
i
can
not
cry
la
prusse
because
at
this
very
moment
my
country
may
be
at
war
with
yours
in
which
case
a
frenchman
would
disgrace
himself
if
he
cried
anything
except
la
france
nor
can
i
very
well
cry
le
roi
guillaume
because
not
being
my
king
it
does
not
matter
to
me
whether
he
lives
or
dies
but
i
will
recite
some
charming
verses
in
answer
to
your
rhine
the
audience
heard
him
impatiently
not
knowing
what
he
meant
to
recite
they
had
another
disappointment
in
discovering
that
the
lines
in
question
were
not
german
but
french
however
they
listened
with
all
the
more
attention
in
enumerating
his
accomplishments
benedict
had
omitted
those
of
amateur
actor
and
elocutionist
the
lines
were
those
written
by
de
musset
in
response
to
the
german
rhine
and
they
lost
nothing
in
his
impassioned
delivery
those
among
his
hearers
able
to
follow
the
reciter
soon
perceived
that
they
had
been
tricked
into
listening
to
truths
they
had
no
desire
to
hear
once
this
was
understood
the
storm
momentarily
lulled
burst
forth
with
redoubled
violence
knowing
that
there
would
be
no
further
chance
of
protection
benedict
was
carefully
considering
the
distance
between
his
table
and
the
nearest
window
when
suddenly
the
attention
of
the
crowd
was
diverted
by
the
report
of
several
rapidly
fired
in
the
immediate
vicinity
turning
towards
the
sound
they
perceived
a
young
civilian
struggling
desperately
with
a
much
older
man
in
colonel
uniform
the
young
man
fired
again
with
the
only
result
of
further
exasperating
his
adversary
who
seized
him
with
a
grasp
of
iron
and
disdaining
to
call
for
help
shook
him
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
then
throwing
him
down
he
knelt
upon
the
murderer
chest
tore
the
now
useless
revolver
from
his
hand
and
placed
the
barrel
against
his
forehead
yes
fire
fire
gasped
the
young
man
but
the
colonel
in
whom
the
bystanders
now
recognized
the
powerful
minister
count
von
bismarck
changed
his
mind
he
pocketed
the
revolver
and
beckoning
to
two
officers
gentlemen
said
he
this
young
man
is
probably
mad
or
at
any
rate
he
is
a
clumsy
fool
he
attacked
me
without
the
slightest
provocation
and
has
fired
five
times
without
hitting
me
you
had
better
consign
him
to
the
nearest
prison
whilst
i
acquaint
the
king
with
what
has
happened
i
think
i
need
hardly
mention
my
name
count
von
bismarck
then
wrapping
his
handkerchief
round
his
hand
which
had
been
slightly
scratched
in
the
conflict
the
count
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
royal
palace
hardly
a
hundred
yards
distant
while
the
two
officers
handed
the
assassin
over
to
the
police
one
of
them
accompanied
him
to
the
prison
where
he
was
at
once
incarcerated
the
crowd
having
now
time
to
remember
benedict
turpin
found
that
he
had
vanished
however
this
did
not
trouble
them
much
for
the
excitement
of
the
more
recent
event
had
changed
the
course
of
their
ideas
let
us
profit
by
the
interval
and
glance
at
the
characters
who
are
destined
to
appear
in
our
recital
but
first
let
us
examine
the
stage
on
which
they
will
play
their
several
parts
least
german
of
all
germanic
states
prussia
is
inhabited
by
a
mixture
of
races
besides
germans
proper
numbers
of
slavonians
are
found
there
there
are
also
descendants
of
the
wends
letts
lithuanians
poles
and
other
early
tribes
and
a
mixture
of
frankish
refugees
the
prosperity
though
not
perhaps
the
grandeur
of
the
house
of
hohenzollern
began
with
duke
frederic
the
greatest
usurer
of
his
day
it
is
as
impossible
to
calculate
the
enormous
sums
wrung
from
the
jews
as
to
narrate
the
means
by
which
they
were
extorted
at
first
a
vassal
of
the
emperor
wenceslaus
when
that
monarch
impending
fall
became
evident
frederic
deserted
his
camp
for
that
of
his
rival
otho
and
when
otho
crown
began
to
totter
he
passed
over
to
sigismund
brother
of
wenceslaus
in
the
same
year
in
which
charles
vi
ennobled
the
goldsmith
raoul
as
a
reward
for
financial
help
sigismund
equally
embarrassed
borrowed
florins
from
frederic
giving
him
the
margravate
of
brandenburg
as
security
fifteen
years
later
sigismund
having
had
to
provide
for
the
extravagance
of
the
council
of
constance
found
himself
in
debt
to
frederic
for
florins
utterly
unable
to
pay
he
sold
or
granted
in
compensation
both
the
marches
of
brandenburg
and
the
dignity
of
elector
in
the
electorate
rose
into
a
kingdom
and
the
duke
frederic
iii
became
the
king
frederic
i
of
prussia
the
hohenzollerns
display
the
faults
and
the
characteristics
of
their
race
their
exchequer
is
admirably
managed
but
the
moral
of
their
administration
can
rarely
be
compared
with
the
financial
one
they
have
advanced
on
the
lines
of
duke
frederic
with
more
or
less
hypocrisy
but
with
rapacity
thus
in
albert
of
hohenzollern
grand
master
of
the
teutonic
knights
then
lords
of
prussia
forsook
his
faith
and
became
a
lutheran
receiving
in
return
the
rank
of
hereditary
duke
of
prussia
under
the
of
poland
and
in
the
elector
john
sigismund
wishing
to
obtain
the
duchy
of
cleves
followed
albert
example
and
became
a
calvinist
the
policy
of
the
great
elector
has
been
summed
up
by
leibnitz
in
a
single
phrase
i
side
with
him
who
pays
best
to
him
is
due
the
formation
of
the
european
permanent
standing
army
and
it
was
his
second
wife
the
famous
dorothea
who
started
shops
and
taverns
in
berlin
for
the
disposal
of
her
beer
and
dairy
produce
the
military
genius
of
the
great
frederic
is
beyond
dispute
but
it
was
he
who
in
order
to
curry
favour
with
the
russian
court
offered
to
supply
the
grand
dukes
with
german
princesses
at
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
one
lady
thus
supplied
a
princess
of
anhalt
is
known
as
catherine
the
great
we
may
remark
incidentally
that
he
also
is
chiefly
responsible
for
the
partition
of
poland
a
crime
which
has
weighted
the
prussian
crown
with
the
malediction
of
nations
and
which
he
celebrated
by
this
scandalously
impious
summons
to

let
us
receive
the
eucharist
of
the
body
of
poland
to
frederic
also
we
owe
the
economical
maxim
he
dines
best
who
eats
at
another
table
frederic
died
childless
a
fact
for
which
oddly
enough
historians
have
seen
fit
to
blame
him
his
nephew
and
successor
william
ii
invaded
france
in
his
entry
preceded
by
the
famous
manifesto
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
was
ostentatious
to
a
degree
but
his
departure
accompanied
by
danton
and
dumouriez
was
accomplished
without
sound
of
trumpet
or
drum
he
was
succeeded
by
the
man
of
jena
frederic
william
iii
among
the
numerous
stupid
and
servile
letters
received
by
the
emperor
napoleon
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
must
be
counted
those
of
william
iii
frederic
william
iv
we
are
rapidly
approaching
our
own
times
came
to
the
throne
in
june
according
to
the
hohenzollern
custom
his
first
ministry
was
a
liberal
one
and
on
his
accession
he
remarked
to
alexander
von
humboldt
as
a
noble
i
am
the
first
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
as
a
king
i
am
only
the
first
citizen
charles
x
had
said
much
the
same
on
succeeding
to
the
crown
of
france
or
rather
de
martignac
had
said
it
for
him
the
first
proof
the
king
gave
of
his
liberalism
was
an
attempt
to
drill
properly
the
intellectual
forces
of
the
kingdom
which
duty
he
entrusted
to
the
minister
eichhorn
the
name
it
means
squirrel
was
quite
prophetic
at
the
end
of
ten
years
the
project
had
not
advanced
a
step
although
the
minister
himself
had
done
wonders
of
perpetual
revolution
on
the
other
hand
reaction
had
progressed
the
press
was
persecuted
promotion
and
rewards
were
obtained
only
by
hypocrites
and
informers
high
office
could
only
be
acquired
by
becoming
a
servile
instrument
of
the
pietistic
party
which
was
headed
by
the
king
frederic
william
and
king
louis
of
bavaria
were
the
two
most
literary
of
contemporary
sovereigns
but
louis
encouraged
art
under
whatever
form
it
appeared
whereas
frederic
william
wished
it
to
be
drilled
into
a
sort
of
auxiliary
to
despotism
feeling
himself
constrained
like
our
great
satirist
boileau
to
give
an
example
of
good
manners
to
both
court
and
city
he
began
a
correspondence
with
louis
in
the
course
of
which
he
sent
the
latter
a
quatrain
commenting
on
the
scandal
caused
by
his
intimacy
with
lola
montes
the
king
of
bavaria
replied
in
another
which
made
the
round
of
all
the
courts
of
europe
contempteur
de

tu
dis
que
roi
sans
pudeur
sans
vertu
je
garde
à
tort
lola
ma
fille
enchanteresse
je
te
oui
mais
and
by
general
consent
of
the
wits
the
laugh
remained
on
the
side
of
the
versatile
king
louis
after
six
years
of
domiciliary
visits
suppressions
and
summary
expulsions
of
offending
journalists
the
prussian
diet
at
length
assembled
at
berlin
in
his
opening
speech
the
king
addressed
the
deputies
thus
recollect
gentlemen
that
you
are
here
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
people
but
their
a
little
later
in
the
year
frederic
william
inaugurated
his
divine
right
by
observing
as
he
tore
up
the
constitution
i
shall
not
allow
a
scrap
of
paper
to
stand
between
my
people
and
their
god
meaning
though
he
did
not
dare
to
say
it
between
my
people
and
me
then
the
revolution
of
burst
forth
and
did
not
spare
berlin
which
was
soon
in
full
revolt
the
king
lost
his
head
completely
in
leaving
the
town
he
had
to
drive
past
the
dead
bodies
of
rioters
killed
in
the
struggle
there
was
a
shout
of
hats
off
and
the
king
was
obliged
to
remain
uncovered
while
the
people
sang
the
famous
hymn
composed
by
the
great
electress
jesus
my
redeemer
lives
every
one
knows
how
absolutism
succeeded
in
dominating
the
national
assembly
and
how
presently
reaction
brought
the
following
leaders
into
power
manteuffel
whose
policy
led
to
the
unfortunate
austrian
triumph
at
olmutz
westphalen
who
revived
provincial
councils
and
brought
the
king
to
the
famous
warsaw
interview
statel
a
converted
jew
and
protestant
jesuit
a
grand
inquisitor
who
had
missed
his
vocation
and
lastly
the
two
gerlachs
intriguers
of
the
first
water
whose
history
belongs
to
that
of
the
two
spies
ladunberg
and
techen
although
the
constitution
establishing
two
chambers
was
sworn
to
by
william
iv
february
it
was
not
until
his
successor
william
louis
was
on
the
throne
that
both
upper
and
lower
chambers
began
to
legislate
a
league
was
now
formed
by
the
bureaucracy
the
orthodox
clergy
the
provincial
squirearchy
and
some
of
the
proletariat
this
was
the
origin
of
the
famous
association
inappropriately
designated
the
association
which
had
for
its
aim
the
annihilation
of
the
constitution
there
now
appeared
as
first
president
of
the
association
at
königsberg
the
count
von
bismarck
who
has
played
so
great
a
part
in
prussian
history
we
can
not
do
less
for
him
than
we
have
done
for
the
hohenzollerns
that
is
to
say
we
must
devote
an
entire
chapter
to
him
and
to
the
prussia
of
for
is
not
the
count
von
bismarck
a
much
greater
monarch
than
the
king
of
prussia
himself
chapter
iii
count
von
bismarck
many
have
sought
and
some
profess
to
have
found
the
reasons
for
the
remarkable
royal
favour
enjoyed
by
count
bismarck
but
the
chief
and
to
our
thinking
the
only
one
is
the
extraordinary
genius
which
even
his
enemies
dare
not
dispute
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
genius
is
usually
anything
but
a
passport
to
the
favour
of
kings
we
will
relate
one
or
two
little
anecdotes
concerning
the
prime
minister
beginning
with
one
which
does
not
refer
to
him
personally
but
may
serve
as
a
sort
of
preface
to
another
every
one
knows
the
absurd
point
to
which
military
etiquette
is
carried
in
prussia
a
pomeranian
general
pomerania
may
be
called
the
prussian
bœotia
being
in
garrison
at
darmstadt
and
being
bored
even
to
the
fullest
possibility
of
darmstadt
boredom
was
standing
at
his
window
wishing
for
a
conflagration
a
revolution
an
earthquake
anything
when
he
beheld
an
officer
in
the
distance
an
officer
minus
his
sword
an
awful
breach
of
discipline
ah
thought
the
delighted
general
here
is
a
lieutenant
to
make
a
scapegoat
of
ten
minutes
lecture
and
a
fortnight
arrest
what
luck
the
unsuspecting
officer
drew
nearer
and
when
within
hail
lieutenant
rupert
shouted
the
general
the
officer
looked
up
saw
the
general
and
immediately
remembering
his
missing
sword
understood
his
terrible
position
the
general
had
seen
him
he
could
not
go
back
and
he
felt
he
must
brave
the
storm
the
general
beamed
and
rubbed
his
hands
cheerfully
at
the
prospect
of
some
amusement
at
last
the
lieutenant
plucked
up
courage
entered
the
house
and
arriving
at
the
beheld
a
regulation
sword
hanging
on
the
wall
what
a
mercy
he
murmured
unhooking
the
sword
and
quickly
buckling
it
on
then
looking
as
innocent
as
possible
he
entered
the
room
and
standing
at
attention
by
the
door
the
general
did
me
the
honour
to
call
he
said
yes
said
the
general
with
severity
i
have
to
enquire
he
stopped
suddenly
observing
that
the
culprit
sword
was
at
his
side
his
expression
changed
and
he
said
smiling
yes
i
wanted
to
ask
i
wanted
to
ask
what
on
earth
was
it
ah
yes
i
wanted
to
ask
after
your
family
lieutenant
rupert
i
particularly
wished
to
enquire
after
your
father
if
my
father
could
hear
of
your
kind
feeling
towards
him
general
he
would
be
greatly
gratified
unhappily
he
died
twenty
years
ago
the
general
looked
considerably
taken
aback
the
young
officer
continued
have
you
any
further
commands
sir
why
no
said
the
general
only
this
never
be
seen
without
your
sword
had
you
been
without
it
i
should
have
given
you
a
fortnight
arrest
i
will
take
the
greatest
care
sir
you
see
answered
the
lieutenant
boldly
indicating
the
sword
which
hung
at
his
side
yes
yes
i
see
it
is
all
right
you
can
go
now
the
young
man
lost
no
time
in
profiting
by
the
permission
he
saluted
left
the
room
and
carefully
hung
up
the
sword
as
he
went
through
the
as
he
left
the
house
the
general
being
again
at
the
window
again
saw
that
he
had
no
sword
he
summoned
his
wife
look
here
he
said
do
you
see
that
officer
certainly
i
do
she
replied
has
he
a
sword
or
not
he
has
not
well
then
you
are
mistaken
he
looks
as
if
he
had
one
but
he
has
the
lady
made
no
remark
being
accustomed
to
accept
whatever
her
husband
said
the
young
officer
escaped
with
the
fright
and
took
good
care
not
to
forget
his
sword
a
second
time
well
a
similar
misfortune
more
a
real
humiliation
of
this
kind
very
nearly
happened
to
the
king
of
prussia
when
he
was
only
the
prince
royal
von
bismarck
was
then
merely
an
attaché
at
the
frankfort
legation
without
any
handle
to
his
name
when
the
prince
stopped
at
frankfort
on
his
way
to
a
review
at
mayence
von
bismarck
had
the
honour
of
being
told
off
to
accompany
him
it
was
a
hot
day
in
august
and
the
railway
carriages
were
stifling
etiquette
notwithstanding
everyone
from
the
prince
downward
unbuttoned
his
coat
on
arriving
at
mayence
where
the
troops
were
drawn
up
at
the
station
to
receive
him
the
prince
refastened
his
coat
but
left
one
button
undone
he
was
just
leaving
the
carriage
when
luckily
von
bismarck
noticed
the
oversight
good
heavens
prince
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
about
and
for
once
forgetting
etiquette
which
forbids
the
royal
person
to
be
contaminated
by
profane
fingers
he
sprang
forward
and
fastened
the
offending
button
hence
according
to
some
came
the
royal
favour
for
the
king
greatly
embarrassed
by
the
events
of
reflected
that
the
man
who
had
saved
his
credit
at
mayence
might
also
save
his
crown
at
berlin
the
count
now
became
the
leader
of
the
junker
faction
voiced
by
the
kreuz
zeitung
he
was
in
fact
the
fittest
man
for
the
position
possessing
oratorical
eloquence
great
mental
and
physical
activity
and
a
complete
conviction
that
any
sort
of
means
is
justified
by
the
end
and
the
end
accomplished
he
flung
from
the
height
of
his
tribune
this
epigram
in
the
face
of
an
astonished
chamber
might
is
right
in
three
words
summing
up
both
his
political
creed
and
the
direct
consequences
which
followed
the
principles
of
humanity
should
be
exemplified
by
three
nations
commercial
activity
by
england
moral
expansion
by
germany
intellectual
brilliance
by
france
if
we
ask
why
germany
does
not
occupy
the
great
position
assigned
to
her
we
find
the
answer
in
this
france
has
attained
freedom
of
thought
but
germany
is
allowed
only
the
freedom
of
a
dreamer
the
sole
atmosphere
in
which
she
can
breathe
freely
is
that
of
the
fortress
or
the
prison
and
if
we
wonder
why
the
rest
of
germany
is
ruled
by
the
rod
of
prussia
the
explanation
may
be
found
in
this
german
do
not
exist
but
there
is
a
national
a
genius
which
desired
no
revolution
but
peace
and
liberty
and
above
all
intellectual
independence
this
desire
was
prussia
greatest
difficulty
she
fought
it
she
weakened
it
and
she
hopes
to
conquer
it
entirely
she
boasts
of
her
compulsory
education
her
children
are
indeed
taught
all
they
can
be
taught
but
once
out
of
school
they
are
never
permitted
to
think
for
themselves
the
junker
faction
is
composed
chiefly
of
younger
sons
who
have
to
seek
either
an
official
career
or
a
military
one
failing
this
they
must
depend
on
the
head
of
the
family
for
a
decent
maintenance
with
very
few
exceptions
there
is
no
old
nobility
in
prussia
the
aristocracy
is
not
distinguished
by
either
wealth
or
intellect
a
few
names
here
and
there
recall
ancient
germanic
history
others
belong
to
prussian
military
annals
but
the
rest
of
the
nobility
can
claim
no
distinction
and
have
only
owned
their
estates
for
a
century
or
two
consequently
nearly
all
the
liberal
and
progressive
members
of
the
chamber
depend
either
by
position
or
office
on
the
government
and
not
one
of
them
was
strong
enough
to
fight
against
a
despotism
which
seizes
a
child
at
the
moment
of
his
birth
guides
him
through
adolescence
and
escorts
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
therefore
count
von
bismarck
could
insult
both
chamber
and
deputies
with
impunity
knowing
that
their
complaints
would
rouse
no
answering
echo
in
the
country
while
at
court
they
were
considered
as
being
next
door
to
the
servants
on
one
occasion
the
president
grabow
being
present
at
a
state
concert
was
going
to
occupy
a
chair
in
one
of
the
less
crowded
rooms
when
a
footman
stopped
him
with
these
chairs
are
meant
for
excellencies
sir
indeed
my
friend
answered
the
president
i
am
evidently
out
of
place
here
from
the
advent
of
hohenzollern
supremacy
may
be
dated
the
decay
of
moral
independence
both
in
prussia
and
the
other
germanic
states
not
only
have
the
hohenzollerns
failed
to
exercise
any
civilizing
influence
by
encouraging
literature
and
purifying
the
language
but
they
have
changed
minerva
into
pallas
and
the
beneficent
deity
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
has
become
the
goddess
of
war
chapter
iv
in
which
bismarck
emerges
from
an
impossible
position
now
for
three
months
past
bismarck
had
been
in
an
impossible
position
and
no
one
could
predict
how
he
would
emerge
from
it
notwithstanding
the
important
events
which
were
being
enacted
from
china
to
mexico
it
was
upon
him
that
the
eyes
of
europe
were
fixed
old
ministers
experienced
in
all
the
wiles
of
diplomacy
followed
him
with
their
eyes
spyglass
in
hand
never
doubting
that
the
minister
had
an
accomplice
on
the
throne
in
a
policy
of
which
they
vainly
sought
for
precedents
in
the
world
history
if
however
there
should
prove
to
be
no
accomplice
they
pronounced
that
he
must
be
a
fool
without
an
equal
young
diplomats
modestly
aware
that
they
did
not
quite
rank
with
the
talleyrands
the
metternichs
or
nesselrodes
studied
him
more
seriously
believing
they
desired
the
infancy
of
a
new
policy
destined
to
carry
their
epoch
to
its
zenith
whispering
the
question
which
germany
has
asked
for
three
hundred
years
es
der
mann
can
it
be
the
man
to
make
this
question
comprehensible
we
must
tell
our
readers
that
germany
awaits
a
liberator
as
the
jews
awaited
a
messiah
whenever
her
chains
gall
her
she
exclaims
bleibt
der
mann
where
then
is
the
man
now
some
pretend
that
in
germany
a
fourth
party
which
up
to
the
present
has
been
crouching
in
the
gloom
is
preparing
to
emerge
a
horrible
figure
if
the
poets
of
germany
are
to
be
believed
listen
to
heine
on
the
subject
there
is
thunder
truly
in
germany
yea
even
in
germany
it
comes
slowly
it
rolls
up
gradually
from
afar
but
i
doubt
not
it
will
come
and
when
you
hear
a
crash
such
a
crash
as
the
world
has
not
heard
in
all
history
you
will
know
that
the
german
thunder
has
done
its
work
at
this
uproar
eagles
will
fall
dead
from
the
upper
air
and
lions
in
the
pathless
deserts
of
africa
will
crouch
terrified
in
their
lairs
in
germany
will
be
enacted
a
drama
compared
with
which
the
french
revolution
will
seem
but
an
had
heinrich
heine
been
the
only
prophet
i
should
not
repeat
his
auguries
for
heine
was
a
dreamer
but
here
is
what
ludwig
b
says
in
truth
germany
has
accomplished
nothing
for
three
centuries
and
has
patiently
endured
all
the
suffering
inflicted
upon
her
but
even
so
her
labours
sufferings
and
joys
have
not
subdued
her
virgin
heart
nor
her
chaste
spirit
she
contains
the
reserve
forces
of
liberty
and
will
ensure
its
triumph
her
day
will
come
and
to
bring
it
about
but
little
is
necessary
a
flash
of
a
smile
a
summer
shower
a
thaw
a
fool
the
more
or
a
fool
the
less
a
nothing
the
bell
of
a
mule
is
enough
to
bring
down
an
avalanche
then
france
which
is
not
easily
astonished
france
which
accomplished
in
three
days
the
work
of
three
hundred
years
and
has
ceased
to
wonder
at
her
own
work
will
survey
the
german
nation
with
astonishment
which
will
not
be
merely
surprise
but
admiration
but
whether
it
was
the
man
or
was
not
the
man
that
the
gallery
watched
as
he
weighed
europe
in
the
scales
putting
everything
into
one
nothing
into
the
other
whether
he
belonged
to
the
old
or
to
the
new
diplomacy
mattered
little
the
only
question
was
will
von
bismarck
demand
a
dissolution
of
the
chamber
or
will
the
chamber
impeach
the
count
the
conquest
of
had
carried
him
to
the
height
of
fortune
but
the
new
complications
arising
of
the
election
of
the
duke
of
augustenburg
made
everything
seem
doubtful
even
to
the
genius
of
von
bismarck
during
a
long
interview
with
the
king
which
took
place
the
very
day
on
which
this
story
begins
he
fancied
that
his
influence
was
shaken
and
he
attributed
the
king
coldness
to
the
persistent
ill
will
of
the
queen
it
is
true
that
until
now
the
count
had
worked
only
for
his
own
personal
advancement
and
having
kept
entire
silence
as
to
his
projects
was
reserving
an
explanation
for
a
favourable
moment
when
by
the
grandeur
and
clearness
of
his
views
he
hoped
to
recover
the
goodwill
of
his
sovereign
by
an
audacious
to
build
up
a
more
solid
and
unassailable
position
than
ever
he
had
then
just
left
the
king
intending
to
unmask
his
new
plan
as
soon
as
possible
counting
on
the
telegraphic
despatches
to
create
an
effect
favourable
to
himself
which
by
making
war
inevitable
would
ensure
his
own
safety
he
left
the
palace
accordingly
immersed
in
these
thoughts
and
so
preoccupied
that
not
only
did
he
scarcely
observe
the
excitement
in
the
crowded
streets
but
he
did
not
notice
a
young
man
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
of
the
theatre
who
left
his
place
as
he
passed
and
followed
him
like
his
shadow
in
and
out
of
the
groups
blocking
the
street
twice
or
thrice
however
as
if
warned
of
this
close
pursuit
by
some
magnetic
current
the
count
turned
his
head
but
seeing
only
a
young
man
apparently
belonging
to
his
own
class
in
life
he
paid
no
attention
to
him
it
was
not
until
he
had
passed
the
friedrich
strasse
and
was
crossing
the
road
that
he
really
noticed
that
the
young
man
seemed
determined
to
follow
him
he
then
decided
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
other
side
to
stop
and
ask
what
his
pursuer
meant
by
shadowing
him
but
the
shadower
did
not
give
him
an
opportunity
the
count
had
hardly
proceeded
three
or
four
steps
on
his
way
when
he
heard
a
report
and
felt
the
wind
of
a
ball
which
just
missed
his
coat
collar
he
stopped
and
turned
sharply
round
seeing
in
a
flash
the
eddying
smoke
the
aimed
revolver
the
assassin
with
his
finger
on
the
trigger
preparing
to
fire
again
but
as
we
have
said
the
count
was
naturally
brave
it
did
not
occur
to
him
either
to
fly
or
to
call
for
help
he
threw
himself
upon
his
enemy
who
without
an
instant
delay
fired
the
second
and
third
shots
which
whistled
harmlessly
by
whether
the
assassin
hand
trembled
under
stress
of
emotion
or
whether
as
some
say
providence
which
nevertheless
permitted
the
assassinations
of
henri
iv
and
gustavus
adolphus
forbade
the
accomplishment
of
such
a
crime
the
two
balls
passed
right
and
left
of
von
bismarck
then
the
murderer
lost
courage
and
turned
to
fly
but
the
count
seized
him
by
the
collar
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
clutched
the
barrel
of
the
revolver
once
again
a
shot
was
fired
the
count
was
slightly
wounded
but
kept
his
hold
and
grasped
his
adversary
closely
throwing
him
on
the
ground
and
finally
handed
him
over
to
the
prussian
officers
seizing
the
favourable
occasion
with
the
promptitude
of
genius
he
again
took
his
way
to
the
palace
bent
on
making
this
event
the
turning
point
of
the
situation
this
time
he
passed
through
a
double
avenue
of
spectators
whereas
previously
in
the
public
commotion
no
one
had
noticed
him
it
was
now
otherwise
the
murderer
attempt
of
which
he
had
been
the
object
and
from
which
he
had
emerged
with
so
much
courage
attracted
every
attention
if
not
their
sympathy
and
whether
loved
or
not
loved
all
made
room
and
saluted
him
sympathy
might
be
wanting
but
the
count
could
at
all
events
read
admiration
upon
every
face
von
bismarck
was
at
this
time
about
fifty
or
tall
with
a
figure
slightly
puffy
and
almost
bald
except
at
the
temples
with
a
thick
moustache
one
of
his
cheeks
was
furrowed
by
a
scar
the
legacy
of
a
duel
fought
at
the
university
of
göttingen
the
palace
guard
had
already
heard
the
news
and
turned
out
to
receive
the
count
who
as
colonel
in
the
army
was
entitled
to
this
mark
of
respect
he
graciously
responded
and
went
up
the
staircase
leading
to
the
king
audience
chamber
as
prime
minister
the
count
had
the
right
of
entry
at
any
time
he
was
about
to
turn
the
door
handle
when
the
usher
in
waiting
stopped
him
saying
his
excellency
will
pardon
me
but
the
king
can
see
no
one
not
even
me
asked
the
count
not
even
your
excellency
replied
the
usher
with
a
low
bow
the
count
stepped
backward
with
a
movement
of
the
lips
that
might
have
passed
for
a
smile
but
was
certainly
not
one
then
he
began
to
study
but
without
seeing
it
a
large
naval
picture
which
decorated
the
standing
out
by
reason
of
its
immense
gilt
frame
from
the
official
green
paper
which
adorns
all
the
royal
apartments
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
door
opened
the
count
hearing
the
of
a
satin
dress
turned
and
bowed
low
before
a
woman
of
forty
to
years
of
age
who
had
evidently
possessed
great
beauty
and
was
indeed
still
beautiful
perhaps
if
the
almanach
de
gotha
were
consulted
it
would
be
found
that
the
lady
was
rather
older
than
this
but
as
the
proverb
says
a
woman
is
as
old
as
she
looks
and
i
see
no
reason
why
queens
should
be
excepted
the
lady
was
queen
marie
louise
augusta
catherine
daughter
of
charles
frederic
grand
duke
of
and
known
throughout
europe
as
the
queen
augusta
she
was
of
medium
height
is
best
described
by
the
essentially
french
word
she
wore
on
her
left
arm
the
feminine
order
of
queen
louise
of
prussia
she
passed
the
minister
slowly
and
somewhat
haughtily
saluting
him
indeed
but
without
her
usual
kindness
by
the
doors
through
which
she
passed
the
count
understood
she
had
been
with
the
king
and
was
now
returning
to
her
own
apartments
the
queen
had
left
the
door
belonging
to
the
king
apartment
open
behind
her
and
the
usher
now
intimated
that
the
minister
might
enter
he
waited
however
until
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
queen
yes
he
said
it
is
true
that
i
was
not
born
a
baron
but
let
us
see
what
the
future
will
do
for
me
and
then
he
passed
forward
the
various
lackeys
or
chamberlains
whom
he
met
hastened
to
open
the
doors
leading
to
the
reaching
it
the
chamberlain
announced
in
a
loud
voice
his
excellency
count
von
bismarck
the
king
started
and
turned
round
he
was
standing
before
the
and
heard
the
name
of
von
bismarck
with
some
surprise
it
being
barely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
the
minister
had
left
him
the
count
wondered
if
the
king
had
already
heard
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
interval
he
bowed
low
before
his
majesty
sire
he
said
an
event
of
great
importance
has
recalled
me
to
your
majesty
but
i
see
with
regret
that
the
moment
is
unfavourable
why
enquired
the
king
because
i
have
just
had
the
honour
of
meeting
the
queen
in
the
and
not
having
the
happiness
of
being
in
her
majesty
good
graces
well
count
i
admit
that
she
does
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
you
she
is
wrong
sire
for
my
devotion
belongs
equally
to
my
king
and
to
my
queen
and
the
one
can
not
become
emperor
of
germany
without
the
other
becoming
empress
a
dream
my
dear
count
in
which
queen
augusta
unfortunately
believes
but
which
is
not
the
dream
of
a
reasonable
being
sire
the
unity
of
germany
is
as
much
decreed
in
the
design
of
providence
as
the
unity
of
italy
excellent
said
the
king
laughing
can
there
be
a
united
italy
while
the
italians
possess
neither
rome
nor
venice
italy
is
in
formation
sire
she
began
her
march
in
and
will
not
stop
on
the
way
if
she
looks
like
stopping
she
is
only
taking
breath
indeed
have
we
not
promised
her
venice
yes
but
it
is
not
we
who
will
give
it
her
who
then
france
who
has
already
given
her
lombardy
and
has
let
her
take
the
duchies
and
naples
france
said
the
king
france
let
her
take
all
that
with
quite
the
best
will
in
the
world
is
your
majesty
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
telegraphic
despatches
which
arrived
when
i
was
here
and
which
were
delivered
as
i
left
yes
i
know
the
emperor
napoleon
speech
at
auxerre
answered
the
king
with
some
embarrassment
you
refer
to
that
do
you
not
well
sire
the
emperor
speech
means
war
war
not
only
against
austria
but
against
germany
it
means
venice
for
italy
and
the
rhine
provinces
for
france
you
really
think
so
i
mean
that
if
we
give
france
time
to
arm
the
question
without
becoming
desperate
becomes
grave
but
that
if
we
fall
promptly
and
vigorously
upon
austria
we
shall
be
on
the
moldau
with
three
hundred
thousand
men
before
france
can
reach
the
rhine
with
fifty
thousand
count
you
do
not
give
the
austrians
their
proper
value
the
swagger
of
our
young
men
has
gone
to
your
head
sire
if
i
appear
to
adopt
the
opinions
of
the
and
of
prince
frederic
charles
i
can
only
say
that
the
prince
having
been
born
on
june
is
scarcely
a
young
man
but
the
fact
is
that
in
these
matters
i
rely
on
my
own
opinion
only
and
i
say
deliberately
in
a
war
against
prussia
austria
will
certainly
be
beaten
really
said
the
king
doubtfully
yet
i
have
heard
you
speak
in
high
terms
of
both
their
generals
and
their
soldiers
certainly
well
then
it
does
not
seem
to
me
so
remarkably
easy
to
conquer
good
soldiers
commanded
by
good
generals
they
have
good
soldiers
sire
they
have
good
generals
but
we
shall
beat
them
because
our
own
organization
and
arrangement
are
superior
to
theirs
when
i
persuaded
your
majesty
to
undertake
the
war
on
schleswig
which
your
majesty
did
not
desire
to
do
if
i
had
not
desired
to
make
war
on
schleswig
it
would
never
have
been
made
that
is
very
true
sire
but
your
majesty
hesitated
i
had
the
courage
to
insist
and
your
majesty
approved
of
my
reasons
yes
and
what
is
the
result
of
the
war
on
schleswig
war
throughout
germany
true
sire
in
the
first
place
i
like
a
situation
that
calls
for
resolute
action
and
as
i
consider
war
in
germany
inevitable
i
congratulate
you
will
you
explain
whence
comes
your
confidence
your
majesty
forgets
that
i
made
the
campaign
with
the
prussian
army
i
did
not
do
it
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
hearing
cannon
of
counting
the
dead
and
of
sleeping
on
the
battlefield
where
i
assure
you
one
sleeps
very
badly
or
for
the
purpose
of
giving
you
what
was
nevertheless
well
worth
having
two
posts
on
the
baltic
of
which
prussia
stood
in
great
need
no
i
made
the
campaign
with
the
object
of
trying
the
austrians
and
i
repeat
that
they
are
behind
us
in
everything
discipline
armaments
use
of
arms
they
have
bad
rifles
bad
artillery
and
worse
powder
in
a
war
against
us
austria
will
be
beaten
from
the
very
commencement
for
we
have
everything
which
she
has
not
and
austria
once
vanquished
the
supremacy
in
germany
must
inevitably
fall
from
her
hands
into
those
of
prussia
and
how
is
prussia
with
a
population
of
eighteen
millions
to
maintain
her
superiority
over
sixty
only
look
at
her
pitiful
appearance
on
the
map
that
is
exactly
the
point
i
have
looked
at
her
for
three
years
and
now
is
the
time
to
mould
her
anew
prussia
is
a
great
serpent
whose
head
is
at
thionville
while
her
tail
is
at
memel
and
which
has
a
lump
in
her
stomach
because
she
has
swallowed
half
saxony
she
is
a
kingdom
cut
in
two
by
another
hanover
in
such
a
fashion
that
you
can
not
get
home
without
going
abroad
you
must
understand
sire
hanover
is
bound
to
become
part
of
prussia
but
what
will
england
say
to
this
england
is
no
longer
in
the
age
of
pitt
and
cobourg
england
is
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
manchester
school
of
gladstone
cobden
and
their
scholars
england
will
do
no
more
for
hanover
than
she
did
for
denmark
must
we
not
take
saxony
also
france
will
never
allow
us
to
meddle
with
saxony
if
only
in
memory
of
the
king
who
was
faithful
to
her
in
not
if
we
took
too
big
a
mouthful
but
if
we
only
nibble
she
will
shut
both
eyes
or
at
least
one
of
them
and
is
not
hesse
also
very
necessary
the
confederation
will
not
abandon
all
hesse
but
if
it
will
let
us
take
half
that
is
all
we
want
now
let
us
consider
the
free
town
the
seat
of
the
diet
the
moment
prussia
can
reckon
thirty
millions
of
men
instead
of
eighteen
the
diet
is
dead
prussia
will
then
be
the
diet
only
instead
of
crying
a
decree
she
will
say
we
shall
have
the
whole
of
the
confederation
against
us
it
will
side
with
austria
so
much
the
better
and
why
austria
once
beaten
the
confederation
is
beaten
along
with
her
we
shall
have
a
million
men
against
us
let
us
count
them
there
are
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
austria
agreed
and
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
venetia
the
emperor
is
too
obstinate
to
recall
troops
from
venice
before
two
or
three
battles
if
he
is
successful
before
ten
if
he
is
beaten
bavaria
has
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
i
will
answer
for
bavaria
her
king
is
too
fond
of
music
to
love
the
sound
of
cannon
hanover
thousand
men
only
a
mouthful
to
swallow
on
our
first
march
saxony
fifteen
thousand
another
mouthful
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
belonging
to
the
confederation
the
confederation
will
have
no
time
to
arm
them
only
we
must
not
lose
a
moment
sire
therefore
i
now
say
victory
the
supremacy
of
prussia
myself
or
or
my
resignation
which
i
lay
very
humbly
at
your
majesty
feet
what
is
that
on
your
hand
count
nothing
sire
it
looks
like
blood
perhaps
it
is
is
it
true
then
that
some
one
attempted
your
life
by
firing
at
you
with
a
revolver
five
times
sire
five
good
gracious
he
thought
it
none
too
many
for
me
and
you
are
unwounded
only
a
scratch
on
the
little
finger
and
who
was
your
assassin
i
do
not
know
who
he
is
did
he
refuse
to
give
his
name
no
i
forgot
to
ask
him
besides
that
is
the
affair
not
mine
i
do
not
interfere
with
other
people
concerns
now
my
own
business
is
my
king
business
and
that
is
here
i
am
listening
said
the
king
the
chamber
is
dissolved
the
following
day
we
mobilize
in
eight
days
hostilities
are
declared
or
else
or
else
what
or
else
as
i
have
the
honour
to
repeat
to
your
majesty
my
resignation
then
without
waiting
for
the
king
answer
the
count
von
bismarck
bowed
low
and
according
to
etiquette
retired
backwards
from
the
presence
the
king
said
nothing
to
detain
his
minister
but
before
closing
the
door
that
gentleman
heard
the
bell
rung
loudly
enough
to
rouse
the
whole
palace
chapter
v
a
sportsman
and
a
spaniel
on
the
day
following
the
events
just
narrated
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
arrived
in
brunswick
by
the
eleven
train
from
berlin
leaving
his
luggage
which
was
labelled
hanover
in
the
station
he
took
a
small
knapsack
on
which
were
strapped
a
and
buckled
on
a
cartridge
belt
flung
a
baldric
supporting
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
completed
his
toilet
with
a
large
grey
felt
hat
altogether
he
appeared
a
sort
of
cross
between
sportsman
and
tourist
accompanied
by
a
beautiful
spaniel
he
left
the
station
and
hailed
an
open
carriage
whereupon
the
dog
instantly
justified
his
name
of
frisk
by
springing
joyously
in
and
installing
himself
on
the
front
seat
while
his
master
reclined
on
the
back
after
the
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
do
things
comfortably
courteously
addressing
the
driver
in
excellent
german
coachman
said
he
kindly
take
me
to
the
best
hotel
the
town
affords
or
at
any
rate
to
the
one
which
provides
the
best
lunch
the
coachman
nodded
as
if
to
say
he
required
no
further
instructions
and
the
carriage
rattled
and
bumped
over
the
cobble
stones
to
the
hôtel
the
dog
who
had
hardly
been
able
to
retain
his
position
instantly
sprang
out
and
showing
his
relief
by
active
gambols
besought
his
master
to
follow
the
latter
alighted
but
left
his
knapsack
and
gun
in
the
carriage
turning
to
the
driver
you
may
wait
he
said
and
keep
an
eye
on
my
things
hackney
coachmen
all
the
world
over
have
a
keen
eye
for
good
customers
this
honest
fellow
was
no
exception
excellency
may
be
quite
satisfied
he
answered
with
a
wink
i
will
keep
careful
guard
over
them
the
traveller
entered
the
inn
and
passing
straight
through
it
arrived
at
a
pleasant
court
shaded
by
here
he
selected
a
small
table
with
chairs
for
two
one
of
which
was
promptly
occupied
by
frisk
his
master
took
possession
of
the
other
and
the
two
proceeded
to
lunch
this
occupied
an
hour
and
no
lady
could
have
received
more
attention
than
the
young
man
bestowed
on
frisk
the
dog
ate
whatever
his
master
ate
only
politely
protesting
when
a
hare
accompanied
by
currant
jelly
appeared
on
the
scene
that
as
a
sporting
dog
he
ought
not
to
touch
game
and
personally
had
a
serious
objection
to
sweets
meanwhile
the
driver
remaining
on
his
box
refreshed
himself
with
bread
cheese
and
a
half
bottle
of
wine
consequently
when
master
and
dog
the
carriage
the
trio
presented
an
appearance
of
general
satisfaction
where
to
excellency
enquired
the
driver
wiping
his
mouth
on
his
sleeve
with
the
air
of
a
man
ready
to
drive
to
the
world
end
if
you
wished
i
do
quite
know
was
the
answer
it
depends
a
little
on
you
how
so
well
if
i
find
you
a
good
fellow
i
might
wish
to
keep
you
on
for
some
time
oh
a
year
if
you
like
no
that
is
too
long
well
a
month
then
neither
a
year
nor
a
month
but
a
day
or
two
oh
that
not
enough
i
really
thought
you
meant
to
take
me
on
lease
to
begin
with
what
will
you
charge
for
going
to
hanover
it
is
six
leagues
you
know
four
and
a
half
you
mean
but
it
is
up
and
down
hill
the
whole
way
nonsense
it
is
as
flat
as
a
one
ca
get
round
you
said
the
grinning
driver
in
one
way
you
can
and
which
is
that
simply
by
being
honest
ah
indeed
that
is
a
new
idea
it
is
one
which
has
not
before
occurred
to
you
i
think
well
name
your
own
price
then
four
florins
but
you
are
not
counting
the
drive
from
the
station
and
the
time
for
lunch
you
are
right
i
will
allow
for
that
and
the
that
is
as
i
may
choose
agreed
i
do
know
why
but
i
trust
you
only
if
i
keep
you
more
than
a
week
it
will
then
be
three
and
a
half
florins
per
day
and
no
i
could
agree
to
that
why
not
because
i
see
no
reason
for
depriving
you
of
the
pleasure
of
doing
the
handsome
thing
when
i
have
the
misfortune
of
leaving
you
the
dickens
one
would
take
you
for
a
wit
i
wit
enough
to
look
like
a
fool
when
i
want
to
well
done
where
do
you
come
from
from
sachsenhausen
and
where
may
that
be
it
is
a
suburb
of
frankfort
ah
yes
it
is
a
saxon
colony
from
the
days
of
charlemagne
that
is
so
so
you
know
that
do
you
i
also
know
that
you
are
a
fine
race
something
like
the
auvergnats
of
france
we
will
settle
up
when
we
part
that
suits
me
down
to
the
ground
what
your
name
lenhart
very
well
lenhart
let
us
get
on
then
the
carriage
started
scattering
the
usual
crowd
of
idle
spectators
a
few
minutes
brought
it
to
the
end
of
the
street
leading
to
the
open
country
the
day
was
magnificent
the
trees
had
just
burst
into
leaf
and
earth
had
assumed
a
mantle
of
green
the
soft
spring
breeze
seemed
laden
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
overhead
the
birds
were
already
seeking
food
for
their
little
ones
and
awakening
nature
appeared
to
listen
to
their
songs
from
time
to
time
a
lark
arose
from
among
the
corn
and
ascending
high
in
the
air
seemed
as
if
floating
above
the
summit
of
a
pyramid
of
song
beholding
this
magnificent
country
the
traveller
exclaimed
but
there
must
be
splendid
shooting
here
is
there
not
yes
but
it
is
strictly
preserved
replied
the
coachman
so
much
the
better
said
our
friend
there
will
be
all
the
more
game
in
fact
before
they
had
gone
quite
a
mile
from
the
town
frisk
who
had
given
various
signs
of
impatience
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
rushed
into
a
field
of
clover
and
pointed
shall
i
go
on
or
wait
enquired
the
driver
seeing
the
young
man
loading
his
gun
go
on
a
yard
or
two
was
the
answer
there
that
will
do
now
draw
up
as
near
to
the
field
as
you
can
the
carriage
with
the
sportsman
standing
up
in
it
gun
in
hand
halted
within
thirty
yards
of
the
dog
the
driver
looked
on
with
all
the
interest
of
his
class
an
interest
which
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
sportsman
and
hostile
to
the
landlord
and
the
gamekeeper
that
is
a
clever
dog
he
remarked
what
is
he
pointing
at
it
is
a
hare
how
do
you
know
had
it
been
a
bird
he
would
have
wagged
his
tail
see
a
big
leveret
showed
itself
among
the
clover
and
fell
a
victim
to
the
gun
it
was
promptly
brought
in
by
frisk
further
on
a
covey
of
partridges
was
seen
but
the
dog
was
called
off
and
the
young
brood
left
in
peace
they
were
already
approaching
hanover
when
a
startled
hare
was
seen
some
sixty
yards
from
the
carriage
ah
said
lenhart
this
one
wisely
keeps
his
distance
it
does
not
follow
replied
the
sportsman
you
do
expect
to
hit
at
that
distance
do
you
have
you
still
to
learn
my
friend
you
who
profess
to
be
able
to
shoot
that
to
a
good
shot
and
a
good
gun
distance
is
of
small
importance
now
watch
then
having
altered
the
charges
in
his
gun
the
young
man
enquired
do
you
know
all
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
hares
lenhart
why
yes
i
think
i
know
all
any
one
can
know
who
ca
speak
their
language
well
i
can
tell
you
this
a
startled
hare
if
not
pursued
will
run
about
fifty
paces
and
will
then
sit
down
to
have
a
look
round
and
perform
his
toilet
look
and
in
fact
the
hare
which
had
run
towards
the
carriage
instead
of
away
from
it
suddenly
stopped
sat
down
and
began
to
wash
its
face
with
its
forepaws
this
predicted
toilet
cost
the
poor
animal
its
life
a
prompt
shot
and
the
hare
bounded
upwards
and
fell
back
dead
beg
pardon
excellency
said
lenhart
but
if
we
are
going
to
war
as
it
is
said
we
are
on
which
side
will
you
be
as
i
am
neither
austrian
nor
prussian
but
happen
to
be
a
frenchman
you
will
probably
find
me
fighting
for
france
so
long
as
you
do
not
fight
for
these
prussian
beggars
i
am
quite
satisfied
if
you
will
fight
against
them
however
but
i
have
something
to
say
well
at
is
it
i
offer
you
the
free
use
of
my
carriage
to
fight
from
thanks
my
friend
is
an
offer
not
to
be
despised
i
always
thought
that
if
i
had
to
fight
i
should
like
to
make
the
campaign
in
a
carriage
well
then
here
is
the
very
thing
you
want
i
ca
tell
you
how
old
my
horse
is
he
was
young
when
i
bought
him
ten
years
ago
but
i
know
if
i
took
him
to
a
thirty
years
war
he
would
see
me
through
it
as
for
the
carriage
you
can
see
it
is
as
good
as
new
those
shafts
were
put
on
only
three
years
ago
and
last
year
it
had
new
wheels
and
a
new
axle
and
it
is
only
six
months
since
i
provided
it
with
a
new
body
you
remind
me
of
an
anecdote
we
have
in
france
replied
the
other
it
is
that
of
simple
simon
knife
which
had
first
a
new
blade
and
then
a
new
handle
but
was
still
the
same
knife
ah
sir
said
lenhart
with
the
air
of
a
philosopher
every
country
has
its
simple
simon
knife
and
also
its
simpletons
my
good
friend
well
if
you
put
new
barrels
on
your
gun
you
might
give
me
the
old
ones
here
comes
your
dog
with
the
hare
lifting
it
by
the
ears
you
can
join
the
other
you
fool
he
said
see
what
comes
of
too
much
vanity
ah
sir
do
fight
against
the
prussians
if
you
do
want
to
but
good
heaven
do
fight
for
them
oh
as
to
that
you
may
be
quite
easy
if
i
do
fight
it
will
be
against
them
and
perhaps
i
shall
not
wait
for
war
to
be
declared
bravo
down
with
the
prussians
cried
lenhart
touching
up
his
horse
with
a
sharp
cut
the
animal
as
if
to
justify
his
praises
and
excited
by
his
master
voice
and
cracking
whip
broke
into
a
gallop
bolted
through
the
suburban
streets
and
only
stopped
at
the
hôtel
royal
chapter
vi
benedict
turpin
lenhart
in
his
double
capacity
of
hackney
coachman
and
purveyor
of
travellers
and
tourists
for
the
hôtel
royal
hanover
was
well
known
to
stephen
landlord
thereof
who
gave
him
a
cordial
reception
anxious
to
magnify
the
importance
of
his
present
consignment
lenhart
hastened
to
inform
him
that
the
new
arrival
was
a
mortal
enemy
of
the
prussians
that
he
never
missed
a
shot
and
that
if
war
were
declared
he
would
place
himself
and
his
deadly
weapon
at
the
disposal
of
the
king
of
hanover
to
all
of
which
stephen
lent
an
attentive
ear
but
where
does
your
traveller
come
from
he
at
length
enquired
he
says
he
a
frenchman
but
i
do
believe
it
i
never
once
heard
him
boast
about
anything
besides
his
german
is
too
good
but
there
he
is
calling
you
stephen
quickly
answered
the
summons
the
stranger
was
talking
to
an
english
officer
of
the
royal
household
and
his
english
appeared
no
less
fluent
than
his
german
turning
to
stephen
he
said
in
the
latter
language
i
have
asked
a
question
of
colonel
anderson
who
has
kindly
given
me
of
the
answer
and
tells
me
to
apply
to
you
for
the
rest
i
asked
for
the
title
of
the
principal
newspaper
here
and
the
name
of
its
editor
colonel
anderson
says
the
gazette
but
does
not
know
the
editor
name
wait
a
moment
excellency
yes
yes
let
me
see
he
is
herr
bodemeyer
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
beard
is
he
not
never
mind
his
appearance
i
want
his
name
and
address
i
wish
to
send
him
my
card
i
only
know
the
office
address
park
strasse
do
you
dine
at
the
if
so
herr
bodemeyer
is
one
of
our
regular
guests
it
is
at
five
he
will
be
here
in
all
the
more
reason
why
he
should
have
my
card
first
and
producing
a
bearing
the
legend
benedict
turpin
artist
he
addressed
it
to
herr
bodemeyer
and
handed
it
and
a
florin
to
the
hotel
messenger
who
undertook
to
deliver
it
within
ten
minutes
stephen
then
ventured
to
suggest
that
if
there
were
private
matters
to
discuss
a
private
room
might
be
desirable
a
good
idea
said
benedict
and
going
to
colonel
anderson
sir
said
he
although
we
have
never
been
formally
introduced
i
nevertheless
hope
you
will
waive
etiquette
and
do
me
the
honour
of
dining
with
me
and
herr
bodemeyer
who
i
think
will
not
refuse
to
join
us
our
host
promises
an
excellent
dinner
and
good
wine
it
is
six
months
since
i
left
france
consequently
six
months
since
i
had
a
chance
of
conversation
in
england
they
talk
in
germany
they
dream
it
is
in
france
only
that
they
converse
let
us
have
a
nice
little
dinner
at
which
we
can
do
all
three
here
is
my
card
that
of
an
insignificant
artist
devoid
of
armorial
bearings
or
coronets
but
with
the
simple
cross
of
the
légion
i
would
add
colonel
he
continued
seriously
that
in
a
day
or
two
i
may
find
myself
obliged
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
and
i
should
like
to
prove
myself
not
unworthy
of
the
consideration
i
hope
you
will
show
me
the
colonel
accepted
the
card
and
bowed
politely
sir
said
he
with
courteous
english
formality
the
hope
you
give
me
of
being
able
to
render
you
some
service
would
certainly
induce
me
to
accept
your
hospitality
i
have
no
reason
whatever
against
dining
with
herr
bodemeyer
and
i
have
a
thousand
for
wishing
to
dine
with
you
not
the
least
being
if
i
may
say
so
that
i
find
your
person
and
manners
exceedingly
attractive
benedict
bowed
in
his
turn
since
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
accept
he
said
and
i
feel
pretty
sure
of
herr
bodemeyer
it
becomes
my
first
duty
to
see
that
the
dinner
is
a
decent
one
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
should
like
to
interview
the
chef
on
the
subject
and
he
departed
kitchenwards
while
the
colonel
sought
the
hotel
left
in
possession
of
a
fair
income
at
an
age
when
the
usual
idea
is
only
how
best
to
squander
it
benedict
turpin
had
shown
practical
sense
as
well
as
genius
a
believer
in
the
excellent
proverb
which
says
that
a
man
doubles
his
opportunities
in
life
when
he
learns
a
new
language
he
had
quadrupled
his
by
spending
a
year
in
england
another
in
germany
a
third
in
spain
and
a
fourth
in
italy
at
eighteen
he
was
a
linguist
and
he
spent
the
next
two
years
in
completing
his
education
by
classical
and
scientific
studies
not
neglecting
the
use
of
weapons
and
the
general
practice
of
games
calculated
to
further
his
physical
development
by
the
time
he
was
twenty
he
had
attained
an
proficiency
very
unusual
in
youths
of
his
age
and
promised
much
in
the
time
to
come
he
took
part
in
the
chinese
expedition
and
being
possessed
of
sufficient
means
to
indulge
his
taste
for
travelling
spent
several
years
in
wandering
hunting
wild
beasts
traversing
deserts
picking
up
tapestries
jewels
curiosities
wherewith
on
his
return
he
furnished
one
of
the
most
artistic
studios
in
paris
at
the
time
our
story
opens
he
had
in
the
course
of
a
round
of
visits
to
celebrated
german
painters
arrived
in
berlin
where
he
upheld
the
honour
of
france
with
the
insolent
good
luck
which
seemed
never
to
desert
him
when
the
attention
of
the
mob
was
momentarily
diverted
by
the
attack
on
the
prime
minister
benedict
succeeded
in
escaping
unnoticed
and
took
refuge
at
the
french
embassy
where
he
was
well
known
early
in
the
following
morning
he
left
by
train
and
finally
arrived
at
hanover
without
let
or
hindrance
he
had
just
given
his
last
instructions
to
the
cook
when
he
was
warned
that
herr
bodemeyer
was
already
approaching
the
hotel
benedict
hurried
to
the
entrance
where
he
saw
close
at
hand
a
gentleman
drawing
near
who
held
a
visiting
card
in
his
hand
and
seemed
pondering
much
as
to
what
the
owner
could
possibly
want
with
him
it
is
said
that
the
denizens
of
that
ancient
gaul
which
gave
cæsar
so
much
trouble
have
so
marked
a
personality
that
wherever
one
is
seen
the
immediately
remark
look
that
a
frenchman
herr
bodemeyer
at
any
rate
seemed
to
recognize
benedict
nationality
at
once
he
advanced
smiling
with
extended
hand
benedict
promptly
descended
the
steps
to
meet
him
and
the
two
exchanged
the
customary
civilities
hearing
that
the
artist
had
come
from
berlin
and
being
professionally
eager
for
news
the
editor
at
once
demanded
an
account
of
the
uproar
of
the
previous
evening
and
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
count
bismarck
as
to
the
latter
benedict
could
give
little
information
he
had
heard
the
shots
seen
two
men
struggling
and
one
handed
over
to
some
officers
and
then
had
hastily
sprung
into
the
café
left
it
by
a
door
in
another
street
and
found
shelter
at
the
embassy
there
he
heard
further
that
the
young
man
was
the
stepson
of
a
proscribed
refugee
of
the
named
blind
and
that
he
had
made
terrible
accusations
against
the
count
which
coming
as
they
did
from
the
relative
of
a
banished
rebel
were
held
to
count
for
very
little
well
we
know
a
little
more
than
that
said
herr
bodemeyer
we
hear
that
the
young
man
attempted
to
cut
his
throat
with
a
penknife
but
that
the
wounds
were
only
slight
and
the
doctor
says
are
not
dangerous
but
the
kreuz
zeitung
will
be
here
directly
and
we
shall
know
a
little
more
even
as
he
spoke
newsboys
hurried
down
the
street
shouting
kreuz
zeitung
zeitung
there
was
a
rush
for
the
paper
hanover
was
nearly
as
excited
as
berlin
had
been
the
night
before
did
the
poor
little
kingdom
already
feel
itself
in
the
crushing
embrace
of
the
prussian
benedict
beckoned
to
one
of
the
newsboys
and
bought
a
paper
turning
to
the
hanoverian
editor
i
hope
you
will
dine
with
me
and
colonel
anderson
he
said
we
have
a
private
room
and
can
talk
politics
as
much
as
we
like
besides
i
have
something
to
ask
of
you
which
i
could
hardly
ask
at
a
public
table
just
then
colonel
anderson
approached
he
and
bodemeyer
knew
each
other
by
sight
already
benedict
now
formally
introduced
them
the
colonel
had
already
glanced
at
his
newspaper
do
you
know
said
he
that
although
the
doctor
pronounced
the
wound
of
no
consequence
young
blind
nevertheless
died
early
this
morning
a
hanoverian
officer
come
from
berlin
says
that
about
four
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
and
wearing
a
large
shady
hat
which
concealed
his
face
arrived
at
the
prison
provided
with
a
permission
to
see
the
prisoner
and
was
taken
to
his
cell
blind
had
been
put
into
a
strait
waistcoat
and
no
one
knows
what
passed
between
them
but
when
his
cell
was
inspected
at
eight
he
was
dead
the
doctor
says
he
must
have
been
dead
nearly
four
hours
so
that
he
must
have
died
about
the
time
this
mysterious
visitor
left
him
is
this
official
news
enquired
bodemeyer
as
editor
of
a
government
paper
i
am
bound
to
accept
only
official
information
let
us
see
what
the
zeitung
has
to
say
they
withdrew
to
the
room
assigned
to
them
and
the
hanoverian
editor
proceeded
to
examine
the
berlin
newspaper
the
first
paragraph
of
consequence
stated
we
are
assured
that
the
king
warrant
decreeing
the
dissolution
of
the
lower
chamber
will
be
officially
published
come
said
the
colonel
that
is
of
some
importance
wait
a
moment
there
is
something
more
it
is
also
announced
that
a
decree
ordering
the
mobilization
of
the
landwehr
will
be
officially
published
the
day
after
that
is
enough
observed
the
colonel
we
know
now
that
the
minister
wins
all
along
the
line
and
that
war
will
be
declared
in
less
than
a
fortnight
let
us
have
the
general
news
we
know
all
we
want
to
know
of
the
political
only
first
on
which
side
will
hanover
be
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
replied
bodemeyer
hanover
is
bound
to
adhere
to
the
confederation
and
on
which
side
is
the
confederation
asked
benedict
on
the
side
of
austria
answered
the
journalist
promptly
but
listen
here
is
a
fresh
account
of
the
scene
in
unter
den
linden
oh
let
us
have
that
by
all
means
cried
benedict
i
was
there
and
i
want
to
know
if
the
account
is
correct
what
were
you
there
very
much
there
and
he
added
laughing
i
might
even
say
with
æneas
quorum
pars
magna
i
was
in
the
thick
of
it
herr
bodemeyer
continued
we
are
now
able
to
give
fuller
details
concerning
the
demonstration
in
unter
den
linden
which
occurred
yesterday
after
the
report
of
the
emperor
louis
napoleon
speech
had
been
received
it
appears
that
just
as
our
most
distinguished
vocalist
finished
singing
german
rhine
which
was
received
with
tremendous
enthusiasm
a
loud
hiss
was
heard
it
was
soon
seen
that
the
author
of
this
insult
was
a
foreigner
a
french
painter
evidently
intoxicated
and
who
would
probably
have
atoned
for
his
folly
with
his
life
had
not
some
prussian
officers
generously
protected
him
from
the
infuriated
populace
the
young
fool
further
defied
the
crowd
by
giving
his
name
and
address
but
when
enquiries
were
made
at
the
black
eagle
this
morning
he
had
disappeared
we
commend
his
prudence
and
wish
him
a
pleasant
journey
is
that
paragraph
signed
asked
benedict
no
is
it
inaccurate
returned
the
reader
may
i
be
permitted
to
remark
that
the
one
thing
i
have
everywhere
observed
in
my
wanderings
over
three
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
i
beg
your
pardon
there
are
five
if
we
count
oceania
is
the
extremely
small
regard
for
truth
shown
by
the
purveyors
of
this
sort
of
news
whether
in
the
north
or
the
south
petersburg
or
calcutta
paris
or
constantinople
they
are
all
alike
each
journal
is
bound
to
give
so
many
beats
of
its
drum
every
day
good
or
bad
false
or
true
it
has
to
give
them
and
those
who
feel
injured
must
obtain
redress
if
they
can
which
means
i
suppose
observed
colonel
anderson
that
this
account
is
incorrect
not
only
incorrect
but
incomplete
the
fool
it
speaks
of
not
only
hissed
but
cried
la
france
further
he
drank
to
the
health
of
france
and
also
disposed
satisfactorily
of
the
four
first
who
attacked
him
it
is
true
that
these
three
prussian
officers
intervened
they
wished
him
to
cry
guillaume
i
and
la
prusse
he
mounted
a
table
and
instead
gave
them
a
recital
of
alfred
de
to
the
german
rhine
from
end
to
end
it
is
also
true
that
just
then
the
reports
of
blind
revolver
attracted
general
attention
and
not
proposing
to
fight
all
berlin
he
profited
by
the
incident
to
escape
taking
refuge
in
the
french
embassy
he
had
challenged
one
two
or
four
adversaries
but
not
the
entire
populace
he
also
left
a
message
at
the
black
eagle
to
be
given
to
any
enquirers
to
the
effect
that
he
could
not
remain
in
berlin
but
would
wait
in
some
neighbouring
country
in
order
to
oblige
any
one
demanding
satisfaction
and
leaving
berlin
by
an
early
train
he
arrived
at
hanover
an
hour
ago
and
at
once
sent
his
card
to
herr
bodemeyer
hoping
that
that
gentleman
will
kindly
announce
in
his
gazette
both
the
town
and
the
hotel
where
this
fool
may
be
found
by
any
one
unable
to
find
him
at
the
black
eagle
good
heavens
exclaimed
the
editor
then
it
was
you
who
caused
this
mighty
uproar
at
berlin
even
i
small
things
make
much
noise
as
you
see
turning
to
the
englishman
benedict
continued
and
now
you
also
see
why
i
warned
colonel
anderson
that
i
had
a
favour
to
ask
him
i
want
him
to
be
my
second
in
case
as
is
quite
possible
some
wrathful
individual
should
arrive
demanding
why
being
in
a
foreign
country
i
have
dared
to
uphold
the
honour
of
my
own
his
hearers
with
one
accord
immediately
offered
their
hands
benedict
continued
and
now
to
show
i
am
not
absolutely
unknown
here
is
a
letter
from
the
head
of
our
of
fine
arts
to
herr
kaulbach
painter
to
the
king
of
hanover
he
lives
here
does
he
not
yes
the
king
had
a
charming
house
built
on
purpose
for
him
at
this
moment
the
door
communicating
with
the
next
room
was
thrown
open
the
rotund
figure
of
the
landlord
appeared
in
the
opening
and
a
solemn
and
impressive
voice
announced
their
excellencies
are
served
whether
the
chef
had
perceived
that
benedict
really
understood
what
he
was
talking
about
or
else
had
had
orders
from
his
master
to
do
what
he
was
told
he
had
at
any
rate
carried
out
his
instructions
to
the
very
last
letter
the
result
being
neither
french
english
nor
german
but
cosmopolitan
a
banquet
for
a
conference
if
not
a
congress
nor
was
brilliant
conversation
lacking
bodemeyer
like
all
german
journalists
was
a
man
but
had
never
been
outside
hanover
anderson
on
the
contrary
had
read
little
but
had
travelled
everywhere
and
seen
much
he
and
benedict
had
explored
the
same
countries
and
encountered
the
same
people
both
had
been
at
the
siege
of
pekin
anderson
had
followed
benedict
in
india
and
preceded
him
in
russia
both
related
their
experiences
the
one
with
english
reserve
and
humour
the
other
with
french
vivacity
and
wit
the
englishman
a
true
modern
phœnician
saw
everything
from
the
industrial
and
commercial
point
of
view
the
frenchman
from
that
of
intellectual
progress
their
different
ideas
brought
forward
with
warmth
and
also
with
the
courtesy
of
and
distinguished
men
crossed
each
other
like
foils
in
the
hands
of
experienced
fencers
emitting
sparks
brilliant
if
transitory
bodemeyer
unused
to
this
style
of
discussion
endeavoured
to
give
it
a
philosophical
turn
in
which
he
was
met
by
benedict
but
which
anderson
found
difficult
to
follow
the
journalist
seemed
unintelligible
but
benedict
theories
he
understood
as
he
had
never
understood
before
the
clock
striking
eight
abruptly
terminated
the
conversation
the
editor
sprang
up
my
paper
he
cried
my
it
is
not
ready
by
half
never
before
had
he
succumbed
to
such
an
intellectual
temptation
frenchmen
are
the
very
devil
he
muttered
trying
in
vain
to
find
a
hat
which
would
fit
him
they
the
champagne
of
the
earth
they
are
clear
strong
and
sparkling
in
vain
did
benedict
entreat
him
for
five
minutes
in
which
to
write
his
announcement
you
must
let
me
have
it
before
eleven
cried
bodemeyer
as
having
discovered
his
own
hat
and
cane
he
fled
as
if
the
enemy
were
behind
him
next
morning
the
following
announcement
might
have
been
read
in
the
hanoverian
gazette
on
june
in
unter
den
linden
at
berlin
i
had
occasion
to
both
give
and
receive
several
blows
in
an
encounter
with
various
excellent
citizens
who
wished
to
tear
me
to
pieces
because
i
had
publicly
emptied
my
glass
to
the
glory
of
france
i
have
not
the
honour
of
knowing
who
gave
these
blows
but
wishing
to
be
known
by
those
who
received
mine
i
hereby
announce
that
during
the
next
eight
days
i
may
be
found
at
the
hôtel
royal
hanover
by
any
one
wishing
to
criticize
either
my
words
or
actions
on
the
said
occasion
and
i
particularly
hope
that
the
author
of
a
certain
article
referring
to
me
in
yesterday
issue
of
the
zeitung
will
accept
this
invitation
being
ignorant
of
his
name
i
have
no
other
means
of
addressing
him
i
wish
to
thank
the
three
prussian
officers
who
interfered
to
protect
me
from
the
amiable
people
of
berlin
but
should
any
of
them
consider
himself
offended
by
me
my
gratitude
will
not
extend
to
refusing
him
satisfaction
i
said
then
and
i
repeat
now
that
i
am
familiar
with
the
use
of
all
weapons
benedict
turpin
the
hôtel
royal
chapter
vii
kaulbach
studio
benedict
lost
no
time
in
leaving
his
note
at
the
gazette
office
and
his
letter
of
introduction
at
kaulbach
studio
where
he
left
also
his
card
on
which
was
written
i
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
on
you
he
therefore
ordered
lenhart
to
be
ready
a
little
before
eleven
in
order
to
pay
his
two
visits
one
of
thanks
to
herr
bodemeyer
and
one
to
kaulbach
as
the
latter
lived
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
town
where
the
king
had
had
a
charming
little
house
erected
for
him
he
called
at
herr
bodemeyer
office
first
the
last
copies
of
the
gazette
were
just
being
struck
off
and
benedict
was
able
to
convince
himself
that
his
letter
was
actually
in
print
as
the
gazette
had
numerous
subscribers
in
berlin
and
would
be
on
sale
there
at
six
that
evening
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
his
communication
would
be
widely
read
the
dissolution
of
the
chamber
was
confirmed
and
it
was
certain
that
mobilization
would
be
announced
on
the
morrow
benedict
continued
on
his
way
to
the
studio
seen
by
daylight
the
house
appeared
to
be
a
pretty
villa
in
italian
style
standing
in
a
garden
enclosed
with
iron
railings
the
gate
stood
invitingly
open
benedict
entered
rang
and
was
answered
by
a
servant
in
livery
whose
manner
showed
that
the
visit
was
expected
he
at
once
led
the
way
to
the
studio
the
master
is
just
finishing
dinner
he
said
but
he
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
tell
the
master
replied
benedict
that
i
am
too
delighted
at
being
able
to
see
the
beautiful
things
here
to
wish
to
hurry
him
and
indeed
the
studio
full
of
original
pictures
sketches
and
copies
of
some
of
the
works
of
the
greatest
painters
known
could
not
fail
to
be
intensely
interesting
to
an
artist
such
as
benedict
who
now
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
sanctuary
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
german
painters
kaulbach
is
an
artist
who
has
adhered
to
his
christian
faith
and
everywhere
one
saw
proofs
of
this
but
among
highly
finished
sketches
for
some
of
his
pictures
such
as
the
dispersion
of
mankind
the
taking
of
jerusalem
benedict
attention
was
drawn
to
a
modern
portrait
group
of
five
persons
it
represented
an
officer
evidently
of
high
rank
holding
a
boy
of
about
ten
by
the
hand
his
charger
stood
ready
on
the
terrace
below
and
a
lady
in
the
prime
of
life
sat
near
him
with
two
little
girls
one
leaning
against
her
knee
while
the
other
sat
at
her
feet
and
played
with
a
small
dog
and
some
roses
the
picture
apparently
was
a
work
of
love
for
the
artist
had
taken
immense
pains
with
it
too
much
so
in
fact
for
the
elaborately
finished
details
threw
the
faces
into
the
background
and
the
general
effect
was
too
flat
absorbed
in
the
study
of
this
group
benedict
did
not
observe
that
kaulbach
had
entered
the
room
and
was
standing
beside
him
looking
on
with
a
smile
presently
he
said
you
are
right
that
picture
is
too
flat
and
i
had
it
brought
back
not
to
finish
it
still
more
but
to
tone
it
down
and
soften
some
parts
such
as
it
is
your
public
would
never
like
it
delacroix
has
spoilt
you
for
pictures
benedict
laughed
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
he
painted
dirty
ones
he
enquired
heaven
forbid
his
works
are
excellent
but
your
nation
did
not
appreciate
them
we
do
him
justice
now
however
yes
now
that
he
is
dead
said
kaulbach
smiling
is
it
not
always
so
not
in
your
case
admired
in
france
adored
in
germany
happily
you
are
yet
with
us
kaulbach
at
this
time
was
about
slightly
grey
sallow
in
complexion
having
brilliant
dark
eyes
and
a
highly
nervous
constitution
tall
and
slight
he
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
artistic
powers
and
hardly
past
that
of
his
physical
ones
the
two
men
studied
each
other
critically
until
at
last
turpin
began
to
laugh
do
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
asked
the
german
i
am
wondering
how
you
have
managed
to
wander
from
pekin
to
petersburg
from
astrakhan
to
algiers
and
yet
found
time
to
produce
the
remarkable
pictures
you
have
painted
i
know
these
only
by
report
unfortunately
but
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
you
are
a
pupil
of
scheffer
yes
i
have
also
studied
under
cabat
great
masters
both
of
them
and
you
are
the
hero
of
that
unlucky
business
at
berlin
i
have
just
read
your
letter
in
the
but
why
well
you
will
have
two
or
three
duels
on
your
hands
so
much
the
worse
for
my
adversaries
allow
me
to
remark
that
you
are
not
lacking
in
no
because
i
have
the
certainty
of
success
look
and
benedict
held
out
his
hand
observe
that
the
line
of
life
is
double
there
is
not
the
slightest
break
anywhere
nothing
to
indicate
accident
sickness
or
even
the
slightest
scratch
i
might
live
to
a
hundred
but
i
wo
say
as
much
of
those
who
quarrel
with
me
aulbach
smiled
at
the
end
of
your
letter
of
introduction
he
said
there
was
a
postscript
which
informed
me
that
you
were
more
deeply
interested
in
studying
occult
science
than
in
pursuing
your
own
art
i
do
know
that
i
study
either
very
much
i
am
rather
a
slave
to
temperament
if
a
thing
amuses
me
well
yes
i
study
it
if
i
think
i
have
found
a
truth
i
try
to
follow
it
out
to
the
very
end
and
i
do
believe
that
chiromancy
can
give
us
a
glance
into
the
future
and
that
the
hand
is
a
page
on
which
the
lines
of
our
fate
have
been
traced
by
destiny
if
for
five
minutes
only
i
could
study
the
hand
of
either
the
king
of
prussia
or
of
count
bismarck
i
could
give
you
some
idea
of
what
will
happen
meanwhile
said
kaulbach
your
science
says
you
will
escape
from
any
duels
arising
out
of
this
berlin
scrimmage
certainly
i
shall
but
we
were
talking
about
your
work
which
is
infinitely
more
interesting
i
believe
i
know
all
your
pictures
or
nearly
so
i
would
wager
you
do
know
the
best
of
them
yes
i
do
you
mean
visited
in
his
tomb
by
the
emperor
otho
it
is
the
masterpiece
of
modern
german
painting
kaulbach
was
evidently
delighted
you
have
seen
that
he
exclaimed
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
benedict
i
do
think
as
much
of
it
as
you
seem
to
do
but
it
is
the
best
thing
i
have
done
oh
pardon
me
but
i
see
two
visitors
who
come
for
a
sitting
but
wait
they
are
kind
friends
of
mine
and
may
not
object
to
your
presence
i
will
tell
them
who
you
are
and
then
if
they
do
not
mind
your
being
here
you
can
please
yourself
as
to
whether
you
go
or
stay
so
saying
he
hastily
quitted
the
studio
a
carriage
was
at
the
garden
gate
quite
plain
in
appearance
with
no
arms
emblazoned
on
the
panels
yet
benedict
practised
eye
saw
at
once
that
the
horses
had
cost
at
least
each
two
gentlemen
were
leaving
it
the
elder
of
the
two
who
seemed
about
wore
the
epaulettes
of
a
general
with
an
undress
uniform
of
dark
green
the
collar
and
facings
being
of
black
velvet
kaulbach
said
a
few
words
upon
which
he
took
off
an
order
he
was
wearing
and
also
two
crosses
retaining
those
of
the
guelphic
order
and
of
ernest
augustus
then
that
he
might
cross
the
little
garden
and
ascend
the
steps
he
took
the
arm
of
the
younger
man
who
seemed
to
be
his
son
and
who
tall
and
very
slight
appeared
to
be
about
and
wore
a
hussar
uniform
of
blue
and
silver
kaulbach
opened
the
studio
door
and
stood
respectfully
aside
benedict
as
he
bowed
instantly
recognized
the
central
figure
of
portrait
group
he
glanced
quickly
at
the
picture
on
which
the
missing
decoration
was
depicted
in
all
its
glory
it
was
the
star
of
the
order
of
the
garter
worn
by
few
except
sovereign
princes
he
knew
at
once
that
the
visitors
must
be
the
blind
king
of
hanover
one
of
the
most
cultivated
and
artistic
sovereigns
of
germany
and
his
son
the
crown
prince
milords
said
kaulbach
i
have
the
honour
to
present
a
brother
artist
to
you
he
is
young
but
is
already
famous
and
he
brings
a
special
introduction
from
the
minister
of
fine
arts
at
paris
may
i
add
that
his
own
personality
is
a
better
recommendation
even
than
those
the
general
bent
his
head
graciously
the
youth
touched
his
cap
the
elder
man
then
addressed
benedict
in
english
regretting
that
his
french
was
only
indifferent
benedict
replied
in
the
same
language
saying
that
he
was
too
great
an
admirer
of
shakespeare
scott
and
byron
not
to
have
made
an
effort
to
read
these
authors
in
their
own
tongue
the
king
satisfied
that
he
was
unrecognized
discussed
various
subjects
and
knowing
that
benedict
had
travelled
much
asked
many
questions
which
were
in
themselves
a
compliment
for
only
men
of
superior
intelligence
could
have
asked
and
answered
them
kaulbach
meanwhile
rapidly
worked
at
his
picture
softening
down
the
too
hard
accessories
the
young
prince
listened
eagerly
and
when
benedict
offered
to
show
him
sketches
made
in
india
he
appealed
anxiously
to
his
father
as
to
when
and
where
he
could
see
them
better
ask
both
these
gentlemen
to
lunch
in
your
own
rooms
said
the
king
and
if
they
do
you
the
honour
to
accept
oh
can
you
come
enquired
the
prince
delighted
benedict
looked
at
kaulbach
in
embarrassment
i
fear
i
may
have
work
of
another
kind
he
replied
yes
said
kaulbach
i
fear
my
friend
here
is
a
trifle
he
only
arrived
yesterday
and
he
has
already
written
a
letter
for
the
which
is
now
well
on
its
way
to
berlin
what
the
letter
i
thought
so
amusing
that
i
read
it
aloud
to
my
father
is
that
yours
monsieur
but
indeed
you
will
have
duels
without
end
i
count
on
two
said
benedict
it
is
a
lucky
number
but
suppose
you
are
killed
or
wounded
if
i
am
killed
i
will
with
your
permission
bequeath
you
my
album
if
i
am
badly
hurt
i
will
ask
herr
kaulbach
to
show
it
you
instead
if
i
am
only
scratched
i
will
bring
it
myself
but
you
need
not
be
anxious
on
my
account
i
can
assure
you
nothing
unpleasant
will
happen
to
me
but
how
can
you
know
that
you
know
my
friend
name
i
think
said
kaulbach
he
is
benedict
turpin
well
he
descends
in
the
direct
line
from
the
famous
enchanter
turpin
the
uncle
of
charlemagne
and
he
has
inherited
the
gifts
of
his
ancestor
good
heavens
said
the
prince
are
you
spirit
magician
or
what
none
of
them
i
simply
amuse
myself
by
reading
the
past
the
present
and
as
much
of
the
future
as
one
hand
can
reveal
before
you
came
said
kaulbach
he
was
deeply
regretting
not
being
able
to
see
the
hand
of
the
king
of
prussia
he
would
have
told
us
what
will
happen
in
the
war
my
lord
he
continued
emphasizing
the
title
could
we
not
find
somewhere
a
royal
hand
for
him
to
see
very
easily
said
the
king
smiling
only
it
should
be
that
of
a
real
king
or
a
real
emperor
such
as
the
emperor
of
china
who
is
obeyed
by
millions
of
subjects
or
alexander
who
reigns
over
the
ninth
part
of
the
whole
world
do
you
not
think
so
m
turpin
i
think
sir
replied
benedict
as
he
bent
low
before
the
king
that
it
is
not
always
great
kingdoms
which
make
great
kings
thessaly
produced
achilles
and
macedonia
gave
birth
to
alexander
and
again
bowing
even
more
deeply
he
left
the
studio
chapter
viii
the
challenge
benedict
prediction
was
duly
fulfilled
he
had
hardly
opened
his
eyes
the
next
morning
when
lenhart
who
had
assumed
the
duties
of
valet
appeared
bearing
a
magnificent
silver
salver
which
he
had
borrowed
from
the
landlord
on
it
were
displayed
two
cards
the
cards
bore
the
respective
names
of
major
frederic
von
bülow
and
georges
kleist
editor
of
the
zeitung
two
different
classes
of
prussian
society
were
therefore
represented
desiring
satisfaction
benedict
enquired
where
these
gentlemen
were
to
be
found
and
hearing
that
they
were
both
at
his
own
hotel
sent
a
hasty
message
to
colonel
anderson
begging
him
to
come
at
once
when
he
appeared
benedict
gave
him
the
cards
requesting
him
to
deal
with
the
owners
in
due
order
of
precedence
beginning
with
major
von
bülow
and
to
agree
to
whatever
terms
were
proposed
whether
as
to
weapons
time
or
place
the
colonel
would
have
protested
but
benedict
declared
he
would
have
it
his
own
way
or
not
at
all
and
anderson
had
no
choice
but
to
agree
he
returned
at
the
end
of
von
bülow
had
chosen
swords
but
having
been
sent
officially
to
frankfort
and
having
come
out
of
his
way
in
order
to
accept
turpin
challenge
he
would
be
greatly
obliged
if
the
meeting
might
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
the
sooner
the
better
said
benedict
it
is
the
very
least
i
can
do
to
oblige
a
man
who
comes
out
of
his
way
in
order
to
oblige
me
all
he
wants
seemingly
is
to
be
able
to
continue
his
journey
this
evening
observed
anderson
ah
said
benedict
but
i
can
not
answer
for
his
ability
to
do
that
however
early
we
meet
that
would
be
a
pity
said
the
colonel
major
von
bülow
is
very
much
a
gentleman
it
seems
that
three
prussian
officers
interfered
to
protect
you
from
the
mob
on
condition
that
you
cried
king
william
la
prusse
pardon
me
there
were
no
conditions
not
on
your
side
but
they
undertook
it
for
you
i
did
not
prevent
them
from
crying
it
as
much
as
they
liked
doubtless
only
instead
of
doing
it
yourself
i
recited
one
of
alfred
de
musset
finest
poems
what
more
could
they
want
they
consider
that
you
treated
them
with
disrespect
perhaps
i
did
well
what
next
when
they
read
your
letter
they
decided
that
one
of
them
must
accept
the
challenge
and
the
other
two
act
as
seconds
they
drew
lots
and
the
lot
fell
on
von
bülow
that
very
moment
he
received
orders
to
go
on
this
mission
to
frankfort
the
others
wished
that
one
of
them
should
take
his
place
in
the
duel
but
he
refused
saying
that
if
he
were
killed
or
badly
wounded
one
of
them
could
take
on
the
dispatches
which
would
not
be
much
delayed
so
i
then
arranged
the
meeting
for
one
very
well
what
about
the
other
man
herr
georges
kleist
is
not
remarkable
in
any
way
he
is
a
typical
german
journalist
he
chooses
pistols
and
wants
to
fire
at
close
quarters
on
account
of
his
defective
eyesight
i
believe
it
is
quite
good
enough
but
however
he
does
wear
glasses
so
you
are
to
be
at
paces
good
gracious
do
you
call
that
close
quarters
have
a
little
patience
you
may
each
advance
fifteen
paces
nearer
which
reduces
the
ultimate
distance
to
fifteen
but
we
had
a
discussion
his
seconds
say
that
he
is
the
aggrieved
party
and
has
the
right
to
fire
first
i
say
nothing
of
the
kind
you
ought
to
fire
together
at
a
given
signal
you
must
decide
it
is
a
serious
matter
and
i
decline
the
responsibility
it
is
soon
decided
he
must
fire
first
i
hope
you
fixed
an
early
time
for
him
also
we
could
then
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
that
is
just
what
i
have
done
at
one
you
meet
von
bülow
with
swords
and
at
a
herr
kleist
with
pistols
well
then
my
dear
colonel
i
will
go
and
order
breakfast
and
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
herr
kleist
that
he
can
have
first
shot
and
he
added
let
it
be
understood
that
i
do
provide
any
arms
myself
i
will
use
the
swords
and
pistols
they
bring
with
them
it
was
then
eleven
benedict
promptly
ordered
breakfast
colonel
anderson
returned
in
ten
minutes
and
announced
that
all
was
settled
whereupon
they
applied
themselves
to
their
repast
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
colonel
said
benedict
do
not
let
us
be
late
we
have
no
great
distance
to
go
it
is
a
pretty
place
as
you
will
see
are
you
influenced
by
surroundings
i
would
rather
fight
on
grass
than
on
cultivated
ground
we
are
going
to
eilenriede
it
is
a
sort
of
hanoverian
bois
de
boulogne
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
there
is
a
little
open
glade
with
a
spring
in
it
which
might
have
been
made
for
this
sort
of
encounter
i
have
been
there
once
or
twice
on
my
own
account
and
three
or
four
times
on
other
people
by
the
way
have
you
secured
another
second
there
are
five
on
the
other
side
one
of
them
will
oblige
me
but
suppose
they
refused
not
likely
but
even
if
they
did
you
alone
would
be
sufficient
and
as
they
seem
anxious
to
finish
the
affair
one
way
or
another
there
will
be
no
difficulties
lenhart
had
already
announced
the
carriage
the
colonel
explained
the
way
to
him
in
they
arrived
at
the
little
glade
with
ten
minutes
to
spare
a
lovely
spot
said
benedict
as
the
others
are
not
yet
here
i
will
sketch
it
and
producing
a
from
his
pocket
he
dashed
off
a
very
accurate
view
of
the
place
with
remarkable
rapidity
and
skill
presently
a
carriage
appeared
in
the
distance
as
they
drew
near
benedict
rose
and
took
off
his
hat
the
three
officers
the
editor
and
a
surgeon
they
had
brought
occupied
it
in
the
officers
benedict
at
once
recognized
his
three
protectors
at
berlin
his
adversaries
left
their
carriage
at
a
little
distance
and
courteously
returned
his
salute
colonel
anderson
went
to
meet
them
and
explained
that
his
principal
being
a
stranger
had
no
second
but
himself
and
asked
if
one
of
his
opponents
would
supply
the
deficiency
they
consulted
a
moment
then
one
of
the
officers
crossed
over
and
bowed
to
benedict
i
am
much
obliged
by
your
courtesy
sir
said
benedict
we
will
agree
to
anything
sir
rather
than
lose
time
replied
the
officer
benedict
bit
his
lip
will
you
at
once
select
the
weapons
he
said
to
colonel
anderson
in
english
we
must
not
keep
these
gentlemen
waiting
von
bülow
had
already
divested
himself
of
helmet
coat
waistcoat
and
cravat
benedict
studied
him
carefully
as
he
did
so
he
appeared
to
be
about
and
to
have
lived
in
his
uniform
until
he
felt
uncomfortable
out
of
it
he
was
dark
with
glossy
black
hair
cut
quite
short
a
straight
nose
black
moustache
and
very
decided
chin
both
courage
and
loyalty
could
be
read
in
the
frank
and
open
glance
of
his
dark
eyes
von
bülow
having
provided
the
swords
benedict
was
offered
his
choice
of
them
he
simply
took
the
first
that
came
and
immediately
passed
his
left
hand
along
the
edge
and
felt
the
point
the
edge
was
keen
as
a
razor
the
point
sharp
as
a
needle
the
major
second
observed
his
action
and
beckoning
colonel
anderson
aside
will
you
he
said
kindly
explain
to
your
principal
that
in
german
duels
we
use
only
the
edge
of
the
sword
to
thrust
with
the
point
is
inadmissible
the
devil
said
benedict
when
this
information
was
repeated
to
him
it
is
well
you
told
me
in
france
where
duels
especially
military
ones
are
usually
serious
we
use
every
stroke
we
can
and
our
is
actually
called
but
indeed
exclaimed
von
bülow
i
beg
sir
that
you
will
use
your
sword
in
whatever
way
you
find
best
benedict
bowed
in
acknowledgment
having
fought
several
duels
at
heidelberg
he
was
well
acquainted
with
german
methods
of
fencing
and
placed
himself
with
apparent
indifference
as
the
affronted
person
has
the
right
of
attack
and
a
challenge
may
be
considered
an
affront
he
waited
standing
simply
on
guard
chapter
ix
the
two
duels
engage
gentlemen
cried
the
colonel
von
bülow
sword
swept
through
the
air
with
a
flash
like
lightning
but
rapid
though
it
was
it
descended
in
empty
space
warned
by
the
instinct
of
a
true
fencer
the
blades
had
barely
crossed
when
benedict
sprang
swiftly
aside
and
remained
standing
unguarded
his
point
lowered
and
his
mocking
smile
disclosing
a
fine
set
of
teeth
his
adversary
paused
perplexed
then
swung
round
so
as
to
face
him
but
did
not
immediately
advance
however
feeling
that
this
duel
must
be
no
play
he
stepped
forward
and
instantly
the
point
of
benedict
sword
rose
menacingly
against
him
involuntarily
he
retreated
a
step
benedict
now
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
circling
round
him
now
bending
to
the
right
now
again
to
the
left
but
always
keeping
his
weapon
low
and
ready
to
strike
the
major
began
to
feel
a
kind
of
hypnotic
influence
overpowering
him
determined
to
fight
against
it
he
boldly
stepped
forward
holding
his
sword
aloft
instantly
he
felt
the
touch
of
cold
steel
benedict
thrust
his
rapier
pierced
von
bülow
shirt
and
reappeared
on
the
other
side
had
not
the
major
remained
standing
motionless
opposite
him
an
onlooker
would
have
supposed
he
had
been
run
through
the
body
the
seconds
hastened
up
but
it
is
nothing
i
assure
you
said
the
major
then
perceiving
that
benedict
had
only
intended
to
pierce
his
shirt
and
not
himself
he
added
come
sir
let
us
continue
this
game
in
earnest
ah
said
benedict
but
you
see
had
i
played
in
earnest
you
would
now
be
a
dead
man
on
guard
sir
cried
von
bülow
furious
and
remember
this
is
a
duel
to
the
death
benedict
stepped
back
and
saluting
with
his
sword
pardon
me
gentlemen
he
said
you
see
how
unfortunate
i
am
although
fully
intending
not
to
use
my
point
i
have
nevertheless
made
two
holes
in
my
opponent
shirt
my
hand
might
again
refuse
to
obey
my
will
and
as
i
do
not
visit
a
country
merely
to
rebel
against
its
customs
particularly
when
they
happen
to
be
philanthropic
so
he
went
up
to
a
rock
which
rose
out
of
the
little
valley
and
placing
the
point
of
his
rapier
in
a
crevice
broke
off
a
good
inch
of
the
blade
his
adversary
wished
to
do
likewise
but
it
is
quite
unnecessary
sir
said
benedict
you
are
not
likely
to
use
your
point
being
now
reduced
to
ordinary
benedict
crossed
swords
with
his
opponent
which
necessitated
their
keeping
close
together
but
he
continually
retreated
half
a
pace
and
advanced
again
thanks
to
which
incessant
movement
the
major
merely
made
cuts
in
the
air
becoming
impatient
he
endeavoured
to
reach
benedict
missed
again
and
involuntarily
lowered
his
weapon
benedict
parried
a
back
stroke
and
touched
von
bülow
breast
with
the
broken
point
said
he
you
see
i
was
right
in
breaking
the
point
of
my
sword
otherwise
this
time
something
besides
your
shirt
would
have
been
pierced
the
major
remained
silent
but
quickly
recovering
himself
again
stood
on
guard
he
now
saw
that
his
adversary
was
a
most
skilful
swordsman
who
united
french
celerity
with
determined
coolness
and
who
was
fully
conscious
of
his
strength
benedict
seeing
that
an
end
must
be
made
now
stood
still
calm
but
menacing
with
frowning
brows
and
eyes
fixed
on
his
enemy
not
attempting
to
strike
but
retaining
a
posture
of
defence
it
seemed
as
if
he
awaited
the
attack
but
suddenly
with
the
unexpected
celerity
which
characterized
all
his
movements
he
sprang
forward
with
a
bound
like
that
of
a
jaguar
aimed
a
blow
at
his
adversary
head
and
as
the
latter
raised
his
arm
in
defence
drew
a
line
with
his
blade
right
across
his
chest
then
springing
lightly
back
in
the
same
instant
he
again
lowered
his
sword
as
before
von
bülow
shirt
slashed
as
though
cut
by
a
razor
was
instantly
tinged
with
blood
the
seconds
moved
forward
do
not
stir
i
beg
cried
the
major
it
is
nothing
but
a
scratch
i
must
confess
the
gentleman
hand
is
a
light
one
and
he
again
stood
on
guard
courageous
though
he
was
he
felt
he
was
losing
confidence
and
dumbfounded
by
his
enemy
agility
a
sense
of
great
danger
oppressed
him
evidently
benedict
was
keeping
just
out
of
reach
and
was
merely
waiting
until
he
should
expose
himself
by
an
unwary
advance
he
understood
that
hitherto
his
opponent
had
simply
played
with
him
but
that
now
the
duel
was
approaching
an
end
and
that
his
smallest
mistake
would
be
severely
punished
his
sword
never
able
to
encounter
benedict
seemed
to
become
lifeless
and
ceased
to
respond
to
his
will
his
previous
experience
in
fencing
seemed
useless
here
and
this
flashing
blade
which
he
could
never
touch
but
which
rose
constantly
before
him
alert
intelligent
as
if
endued
with
life
confused
his
senses
he
dared
not
risk
a
movement
before
this
enemy
always
just
beyond
his
reach
so
imperturbable
and
yet
so
alert
and
who
evidently
intended
like
the
artist
he
was
either
to
finish
with
one
brilliant
stroke
or
else
which
did
not
seem
likely
to
expire
in
a
dignified
pose
like
the
dying
gladiator
but
exasperated
by
his
opponent
perfect
bodily
grace
by
his
elegant
and
masterly
swordsmanship
and
still
more
by
the
mocking
smile
which
hovered
on
his
lips
von
bülow
felt
the
blood
rise
to
his
temples
and
could
not
resist
muttering
between
his
teeth
this
fellow
is
the
very
devil
and
springing
forward
no
longer
fearing
the
broken
point
he
raised
his
sword
and
aimed
a
blow
with
all
his
might
at
his
adversary
a
blow
which
had
it
reached
its
object
would
have
split
his
head
as
though
it
had
been
an
apple
again
the
stroke
only
encountered
empty
air
for
once
more
benedict
had
effaced
himself
by
a
light
graceful
spring
very
familiar
to
parisian
fencing
masters
the
major
raised
sword
had
broken
his
guard
a
flash
as
of
lightning
and
his
arm
streaming
with
blood
fell
against
his
side
his
sword
dropped
but
remained
upright
supported
by
the
sword
knot
the
seconds
hurried
to
his
side
very
pale
but
with
smiling
lips
von
bülow
bowed
to
benedict
and
said
i
thank
you
sir
when
you
might
have
run
me
through
the
body
you
only
wounded
my
shirt
when
you
might
have
cut
me
in
two
you
let
me
off
with
the
sort
of
cut
one
gets
in
shaving
and
now
when
you
might
have
either
cleft
my
head
or
maimed
my
arm
i
escape
with
a
ruined
sleeve
i
now
ask
you
to
extend
your
courtesy
even
further
and
to
complete
the
record
like
the
gentleman
you
are
by
explaining
why
you
have
spared
me
thus
sir
said
benedict
with
a
smile
in
the
house
of
herr
fellner
the
burgomaster
of
frankfort
i
was
introduced
to
his
a
charming
lady
who
adores
her
husband
her
name
was
the
baroness
von
bülow
when
i
saw
your
card
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
related
and
though
beautiful
as
she
is
mourning
could
only
add
to
her
charm
it
would
grieve
me
to
have
been
the
cause
of
compelling
her
to
wear
it
the
major
looked
benedict
in
the
face
and
stern
soldier
though
he
might
be
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
madame
von
bülow
is
my
wife
he
said
believe
me
sir
wherever
she
may
meet
you
she
will
greet
you
thus
husband
foolishly
quarrelled
with
you
sir
may
you
ever
be
blessed
because
for
my
sake
you
spared
him
and
she
will
give
you
her
hand
with
as
much
gratitude
as
i
now
offer
you
mine
and
he
added
smiling
forgive
me
for
only
offering
my
left
hand
it
is
entirely
your
own
fault
that
i
can
not
give
you
the
right
and
now
although
the
wound
was
not
dangerous
von
bülow
did
not
refuse
to
have
it
dressed
the
surgeon
promptly
ripped
up
his
sleeve
disclosing
a
wound
not
very
deep
but
terrible
to
look
at
which
extended
down
the
arm
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
and
one
shuddered
to
think
what
such
a
wound
would
have
been
had
the
swordsman
struck
with
all
his
force
instead
of
simply
drawing
his
blade
along
the
arm
the
surgeon
dipped
a
cloth
in
the
spring
which
rose
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
wrapped
it
round
the
arm
he
then
drew
the
sides
of
the
wound
together
and
strapped
them
with
plaster
he
assured
the
major
that
he
would
be
quite
able
to
continue
his
journey
to
frankfort
in
the
evening
benedict
offered
his
carriage
to
the
major
who
however
declined
being
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
to
his
successor
he
excused
himself
on
the
score
that
courtesy
required
him
to
wait
for
herr
georges
kleist
although
herr
kleist
having
had
time
to
see
what
sort
of
adversary
he
had
to
deal
with
would
willingly
have
been
some
leagues
away
he
put
a
brave
face
on
the
matter
and
although
he
grew
perceptibly
pale
during
the
first
duel
and
still
paler
when
the
wound
was
dressed
he
was
nevertheless
the
first
to
say
excuse
my
interrupting
you
gentlemen
but
it
is
my
turn
now
i
am
quite
at
your
service
sir
said
benedict
you
are
not
properly
dressed
for
a
duel
with
pistols
interposed
colonel
anderson
glancing
at
benedict
costume
really
said
benedict
i
never
thought
about
what
clothes
i
was
to
fight
in
i
only
wanted
to
do
it
with
comfort
to
myself
that
all
you
can
at
least
put
on
your
tunic
and
button
it
bah
it
is
much
too
hot
perhaps
we
ought
to
have
taken
the
pistols
first
all
this
may
have
unsteadied
your
hand
my
hand
is
my
servant
dear
colonel
it
knows
it
has
to
obey
me
and
you
will
see
it
does
so
do
you
wish
to
see
the
pistols
you
are
to
use
you
have
seen
them
have
you
not
are
they
double
barrelled
or
single
single
barrelled
duelling
pistols
they
were
hired
this
morning
from
a
gunsmith
in
the
grande
place
then
call
my
other
second
and
see
them
properly
loaded
mind
the
shot
is
inside
the
barrels
and
not
dropped
outside
i
will
load
them
myself
colonel
asked
the
prussian
officers
do
you
wish
to
see
the
pistols
loaded
yes
i
wish
to
do
so
but
how
are
we
to
arrange
herr
kleist
will
only
have
one
second
these
two
gentlemen
may
answer
for
herr
kleist
said
the
major
and
i
will
go
over
to
m
turpin
and
his
wound
being
now
bandaged
he
went
and
sat
down
on
the
rock
which
gave
its
name
to
the
glade
meanwhile
the
pistols
were
loaded
colonel
anderson
fulfilling
his
promise
by
putting
in
the
balls
himself
benedict
came
up
to
him
tell
me
the
englishman
asked
gravely
do
you
mean
to
kill
him
what
do
you
expect
one
ca
exactly
play
with
pistols
as
one
can
with
swords
or
rapiers
surely
there
is
some
way
of
disabling
people
with
whom
you
have
no
serious
quarrel
without
killing
them
outright
i
really
can
not
undertake
to
miss
him
just
to
oblige
you
think
he
would
naturally
go
and
publish
everywhere
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
shoot
all
right
i
see
i
need
not
have
spoken
i
bet
you
have
an
idea
of
some
sort
frankly
i
have
but
then
he
must
do
his
part
what
must
he
do
just
keep
perfectly
still
it
ought
not
to
be
so
very
difficult
see
they
are
ready
the
seconds
had
just
measured
the
paces
colonel
anderson
now
measured
off
fifteen
from
each
end
and
to
mark
the
exact
limit
which
neither
combatant
was
to
pass
he
laid
two
scabbards
across
and
planted
a
sword
upright
in
the
ground
at
each
end
to
decide
the
to
your
places
gentlemen
cried
the
seconds
herr
kleist
having
selected
his
pistol
the
colonel
brought
the
other
to
benedict
who
was
talking
to
the
major
and
who
took
the
pistol
without
as
much
as
looking
at
it
and
still
chatting
with
von
bülow
walked
quietly
to
his
place
the
duellists
now
stood
at
the
extreme
distance
gentlemen
said
colonel
anderson
you
are
now
paces
apart
each
of
you
may
either
advance
fifteen
paces
before
firing
or
may
fire
from
where
he
now
stands
herr
georges
kleist
has
the
first
shot
and
may
fire
as
soon
as
he
pleases
having
fired
he
may
hold
his
pistol
so
as
to
protect
any
part
of
himself
he
wishes
now
gentlemen
the
two
adversaries
advanced
towards
each
other
having
arrived
at
the
mark
benedict
waited
standing
facing
his
opponent
with
folded
arms
a
light
breeze
ruffled
his
hair
and
blew
his
shirt
open
at
the
chest
he
had
walked
at
his
ordinary
pace
herr
kleist
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
with
closely
buttoned
coat
had
advanced
slowly
by
force
of
will
overcoming
physical
disinclination
he
halted
at
the
limit
you
are
ready
sir
he
asked
quite
ready
sir
will
you
not
turn
sideways
i
am
not
accustomed
to
do
so
then
turning
himself
herr
kleist
slowly
raised
his
pistol
took
aim
and
fired
benedict
heard
the
ball
whiz
close
by
his
ear
and
felt
the
wind
ruffle
his
hair
it
had
passed
within
an
inch
of
his
head
his
adversary
instantly
raised
his
pistol
holding
it
so
as
to
protect
his
face
but
was
unable
entirely
to
control
a
nervous
movement
of
his
hand
sir
said
benedict
you
courteously
asked
just
now
if
i
would
not
stand
sideways
which
is
unusual
between
combatants
permit
me
in
my
turn
to
offer
a
piece
of
advice
or
rather
make
a
request
what
is
it
sir
asked
the
journalist
still
protecting
himself
with
his
pistol
this
keep
your
hand
steady
your
pistol
is
moving
i
wish
to
put
my
ball
in
the
wood
of
your
pistol
which
will
be
very
difficult
unless
you
keep
it
quite
still
against
my
own
will
i
might
hit
you
either
in
the
cheek
or
the
back
of
the
head
whereas
if
you
keep
your
hand
just
as
it
is
he
raised
his
pistol
and
fired
instantly
there
it
is
done
now
it
was
done
so
rapidly
that
no
one
could
have
supposed
he
had
taken
any
aim
at
all
but
even
as
the
report
was
heard
herr
kleist
pistol
was
blown
to
pieces
and
he
himself
staggered
and
fell
on
one
knee
ah
said
anderson
you
have
killed
him
i
think
not
replied
benedict
i
aimed
between
the
two
screws
which
hold
the
hammer
it
is
the
shock
of
the
concussion
which
has
brought
him
down
the
surgeon
and
the
two
seconds
hastened
to
the
wounded
man
who
now
held
only
the
butt
end
of
his
pistol
there
was
a
terrible
bruise
on
his
cheek
reaching
from
the
eye
to
the
jaw
otherwise
he
was
untouched
only
the
shock
had
knocked
him
down
the
barrel
of
the
pistol
was
picked
up
on
one
side
and
the
lock
on
the
other
the
ball
had
lodged
exactly
between
the
two
screws
had
it
continued
its
course
unobstructed
it
would
have
broken
the
upper
jaw
and
penetrated
the
brain
the
dressing
was
simple
the
bruise
was
a
very
bad
one
but
the
skin
was
only
broken
in
two
places
and
the
surgeon
considered
a
bandage
to
be
all
that
was
required
benedict
embraced
the
major
bowed
to
the
journalist
shook
hands
with
the
seconds
put
on
his
coat
and
got
into
the
carriage
looking
less
dishevelled
than
if
he
had
come
from
a
picnic
well
my
dear
sponsor
he
said
to
colonel
anderson
well
my
dear
godson
responded
the
latter
i
know
at
least
ten
men
besides
myself
who
would
willingly
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
to
see
what
i
have
seen
sir
said
lenhart
if
you
would
promise
neither
to
hunt
nor
to
fight
unless
i
am
there
to
see
i
my
horse
and
my
carriage
should
be
at
your
service
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
indeed
benedict
returned
as
he
had
foretold
having
fought
his
duels
vanquished
his
adversaries
and
come
off
without
a
single
scratch
chapter
x
what
was
written
in
a
king
hand
when
benedict
returned
to
his
hotel
he
was
met
by
kaulbach
servant
sent
by
his
master
to
learn
what
had
happened
in
the
good
town
of
hanover
it
had
speedily
become
known
that
in
answer
to
benedict
letter
in
the
gazette
two
challenges
had
been
received
that
very
morning
and
that
he
his
challengers
and
seconds
had
all
gone
to
eilenriede
the
usual
place
for
settling
affairs
of
this
description
benedict
desired
him
to
assure
his
master
that
all
was
well
adding
that
he
would
have
come
in
person
to
acknowledge
his
courtesy
had
he
not
feared
to
rouse
the
curiosity
of
the
whole
town
colonel
anderson
had
made
an
excuse
for
leaving
benedict
as
soon
as
they
returned
being
an
officer
of
the
royal
ordnance
he
had
probably
some
report
to
make
to
the
king
the
news
of
the
result
of
this
double
combat
spread
as
rapidly
as
had
that
of
the
challenges
such
an
event
as
two
duels
successfully
fought
without
a
scratch
being
received
was
quite
unheard
of
and
was
considered
so
extraordinary
that
the
young
men
of
the
town
who
also
had
no
love
for
the
prussians
sent
a
deputation
to
congratulate
benedict
on
his
success
he
received
the
deputies
and
replied
in
such
excellent
german
that
they
retired
marvelling
more
than
ever
the
doors
had
scarcely
closed
on
them
when
stephen
appeared
and
announced
that
all
his
guests
were
so
interested
in
the
events
of
the
day
that
they
begged
benedict
would
honour
them
by
dining
at
the
in
order
that
they
might
all
have
the
pleasure
of
personally
congratulating
him
benedict
replied
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
so
much
admiration
for
his
perfectly
natural
conduct
but
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
do
anything
which
might
be
agreeable
to
his
fellow
guests
stephen
had
time
to
let
the
news
circulate
in
the
town
that
the
young
frenchman
of
whom
every
one
was
talking
would
for
once
only
consent
to
dine
at
the
instead
of
only
he
had
covers
laid
for
two
hundred
guests
every
place
was
occupied
the
police
feared
disorder
of
some
kind
and
came
to
investigate
they
were
assured
that
it
was
only
a
family
affair
a
demonstration
such
as
had
been
made
three
days
before
under
the
windows
of
count
von
bismarck
only
it
was
the
other
way
about
now
the
hanoverian
police
was
an
excellent
body
which
highly
approved
of
family
fêtes
and
patriotic
demonstrations
therefore
instead
of
objecting
to
this
one
they
encouraged
it
with
all
their
power
thanks
to
which
all
passed
off
in
perfect
order
at
midnight
benedict
was
at
length
allowed
to
retire
but
his
admirers
organized
a
serenade
beneath
his
windows
which
lasted
till
two
in
the
morning
at
nine
kaulbach
entered
his
room
the
crown
prince
invited
benedict
to
breakfast
at
the
palace
of
herrenhausen
and
requested
him
to
bring
his
sketches
kaulbach
was
commissioned
to
bring
him
back
the
breakfast
was
at
eleven
but
the
prince
would
be
obliged
if
benedict
would
come
at
ten
in
order
to
have
some
time
for
conversation
both
before
and
after
benedict
lost
no
time
in
dressing
and
although
kaulbach
intimate
at
the
palace
assured
him
he
could
go
in
ordinary
costume
he
preferred
to
wear
the
naval
uniform
in
which
he
had
made
the
chinese
campaign
on
his
breast
was
the
cross
of
the
légion
of
which
the
simple
red
ribbon
means
much
more
when
worn
by
some
than
do
the
various
grand
crosses
worn
by
others
he
added
a
sabre
the
gift
of
said
pasha
took
his
sketches
and
got
into
the
carriage
with
kaulbach
lenhart
had
a
whole
day
holiday
minutes
brought
them
to
herrenhausen
which
is
about
a
league
from
hanover
and
the
carriage
being
open
benedict
could
see
the
young
prince
watching
for
him
eagerly
at
a
window
he
was
accompanied
only
by
his
an
officer
of
engineers
and
consequently
well
able
to
draw
also
which
is
more
unusual
he
did
not
disdain
the
picturesque
the
prince
enquired
courteously
after
benedict
health
without
making
the
smallest
allusion
to
the
duels
of
the
day
before
it
was
evident
nevertheless
that
he
knew
all
about
them
had
there
been
any
doubts
on
the
subject
they
would
have
been
dispelled
by
the
appearance
of
colonel
anderson
as
another
invited
guest
but
the
prince
chief
interest
centred
in
the
portfolio
which
benedict
carried
under
his
arm
anticipating
his
wishes
benedict
observed
your
highness
wished
to
see
some
of
my
sketches
i
have
brought
some
representing
hunting
incidents
thinking
that
they
might
interest
you
most
oh
let
me
see
let
me
see
exclaimed
the
prince
extending
his
hand
and
placing
the
portfolio
on
the
piano
he
began
eagerly
to
examine
the
contents
after
having
turned
over
several
ah
said
he
but
they
are
beautiful
will
you
not
tell
me
something
of
the
adventures
which
i
am
sure
they
illustrate
they
must
be
so
interesting
benedict
endeavoured
to
gratify
the
prince
and
the
time
both
before
and
after
the
breakfast
passed
rapidly
in
listening
to
accounts
of
elephant
hunting
of
encounters
with
pirates
in
the
straits
of
malacca
of
adventures
in
the
caucasus
and
he
had
just
finished
an
especially
thrilling
anecdote
relating
to
the
poisonous
snakes
of
india
when
the
king
was
seen
approaching
from
the
gallery
he
held
the
arm
of
his
with
whom
he
was
conversing
and
walked
firmly
as
if
able
to
see
he
entered
the
without
being
announced
the
four
guests
rose
immediately
but
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
gentlemen
said
the
king
i
merely
came
to
visit
the
prince
to
ask
if
he
has
all
he
wants
and
if
not
to
convey
his
wishes
to
the
persons
concerned
no
thanks
to
your
majesty
kindness
nothing
is
wanting
here
except
yourself
your
knowledge
of
men
has
not
deceived
you
and
monsieur
benedict
is
the
most
delightful
companion
i
ever
met
the
prince
is
imaginative
sire
said
benedict
laughing
he
attributes
to
some
very
simple
anecdotes
and
hasty
sketches
an
excellence
which
they
do
not
possess
but
the
king
replied
as
if
answering
his
own
thought
the
thought
which
had
led
him
to
visit
the
young
man
yesterday
he
said
addressing
benedict
and
turning
towards
him
as
he
always
did
in
conversation
you
said
something
about
a
science
which
interested
me
in
former
days
namely
chiromancy
my
thoughts
carry
me
on
towards
the
mysterious
unexplored
regions
of
the
human
mind
of
nature
of
creation
i
should
like
to
know
they
are
based
upon
logic
on
physiology
for
instance
i
know
sire
replied
benedict
smiling
that
is
why
i
ventured
yesterday
to
mention
the
occult
sciences
to
your
majesty
you
know
but
how
demanded
the
king
i
should
be
a
poor
student
sire
if
i
had
limited
my
enquiries
to
the
hands
only
and
had
not
united
the
study
of
lavater
and
gall
to
that
of
arpentigny
i
saw
at
once
in
the
form
of
your
hands
and
head
those
precious
aptitudes
which
are
shown
in
phrenology
by
the
organs
of
the
poetic
faculty
and
of
the
love
of
harmony
which
betoken
the
student
of
natural
science
the
protection
accorded
by
your
majesty
to
the
poor
herbalist
lampe
arose
not
from
benevolence
only
but
from
the
conviction
that
certain
men
are
empowered
to
receive
a
revelation
and
that
it
is
not
always
the
highly
placed
ones
of
earth
to
whom
truth
is
thus
manifested
it
is
true
said
the
king
other
men
may
see
the
stars
shining
in
the
midnight
silence
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
actually
hear
that
of
the
spheres
spoken
of
by
pythagoras
and
i
am
proud
to
think
that
while
i
stand
on
the
summit
of
earthly
society
there
are
immediately
above
me
intermediate
angelic
influences
which
carry
on
a
boundless
electric
chain
linking
us
not
merely
with
our
own
little
planetary
system
but
with
others
with
the
whole
universe
i
do
not
venture
the
king
continued
with
a
smile
to
discourse
openly
on
these
beliefs
i
should
get
the
reputation
of
king
of
dreams
about
the
worst
a
king
can
have
but
to
you
who
are
a
dreamer
like
myself
i
do
say
yes
i
believe
in
these
celestial
influences
and
i
believe
that
each
mortal
has
in
that
precious
casket
which
he
calls
his
skull
the
signs
of
his
destiny
he
may
strive
to
alter
or
delay
its
course
but
it
will
bear
him
on
irresistibly
to
fortune
success
or
misery
as
the
case
may
be
and
i
speak
with
conviction
because
i
have
had
proofs
in
early
youth
i
once
met
a
gipsy
woman
in
the
course
of
a
solitary
walk
she
examined
my
hand
and
told
me
certain
things
which
came
to
pass
i
wish
to
believe
you
but
i
must
have
proofs
can
you
read
the
past
in
my
hand
even
as
the
gipsy
read
the
future
can
you
do
you
sincerely
believe
you
have
this
power
i
do
sire
and
i
think
actual
science
will
tell
you
what
has
before
been
perhaps
merely
guessed
at
by
intuition
or
tradition
well
then
said
the
king
extending
his
hand
now
tell
me
what
you
read
sire
replied
benedict
i
do
not
know
how
far
i
dare
dare
what
enquired
the
king
what
if
i
read
only
a
threatening
future
we
live
in
days
when
no
predictions
however
terrible
can
exceed
the
reality
of
the
convulsions
which
are
taking
place
around
us
what
can
you
predict
for
me
that
can
be
so
terrible
is
it
the
loss
of
my
kingdom
i
lost
more
than
a
kingdom
when
i
lost
the
vision
of
sun
and
sky
of
earth
and
sea
take
my
hand
and
tell
me
what
is
written
everything
everything
as
for
misfortunes
is
it
not
better
to
know
of
them
than
to
encounter
them
unforeseen
benedict
bowed
so
deeply
over
king
george
hand
that
he
almost
touched
it
with
his
lips
a
truly
royal
hand
he
said
after
having
glanced
over
it
a
beneficent
hand
an
artistic
hand
i
did
not
ask
for
compliments
sir
said
the
king
smiling
see
my
dear
master
said
benedict
addressing
kaulbach
how
well
the
mount
of
apollo
there
under
the
is
developed
apollo
bestows
love
of
the
arts
he
is
the
giver
of
intelligence
of
all
that
is
brilliant
and
creates
brilliance
it
is
he
who
gives
the
hope
of
an
immortal
name
calm
of
the
soul
the
sympathy
that
creates
love
look
at
the
mount
of
mars
represented
by
the
part
opposite
the
thumb
this
is
what
gives
courage
both
civil
and
military
calm
coolness
in
danger
resignation
pride
devotion
resolution
and
the
strength
of
resistance
unfortunately
saturn
is
against
us
saturn
threatens
you
know
sire
saturn
is
fate
now
i
ought
to
tell
you
the
lines
of
saturn
are
not
only
unfavourable
they
are
calamitous
and
here
benedict
raised
his
head
and
looking
at
the
king
with
the
utmost
respect
and
sympathy
i
might
continue
more
intimately
yet
sire
he
said
and
reveal
your
whole
character
in
its
most
secret
recesses
i
might
sketch
your
inclinations
one
by
one
to
you
to
their
lightest
shades
but
i
should
prefer
to
pass
at
once
to
graver
facts
at
twelve
years
old
your
majesty
had
a
serious
illness
it
is
true
said
the
king
at
nineteen
a
line
extends
both
towards
the
brain
and
towards
the
mount
of
the
sun
a
nervous
seizure
on
one
side
on
the
other
something
resembling
death
but
which
is
not
death
an
eclipse
and
worse
than
that
an
eclipse
is
momentary
one
night
the
gipsy
told
me
literally
the
same
as
you
something
that
resembles
death
but
is
not
death
the
fact
is
that
at
the
age
of
nineteen
i
passed
through
great
trouble
stay
here
sire
on
jupiter
there
is
a
marvellous
gleam
one
of
the
highest
seats
of
human
fortune
about
the
age
of
again
the
words
of
the
gipsy
at
i
became
king
i
was
ignorant
of
the
precise
dates
said
benedict
but
it
might
be
supposed
that
i
knew
them
let
me
look
for
a
fact
that
i
could
not
have
known
ah
i
see
it
yes
it
is
certainly
here
an
agony
of
terror
an
accident
due
to
water
what
is
it
a
boat
in
danger
a
tempest
watched
from
the
shore
the
imminent
wreck
of
a
vessel
containing
some
one
beloved
there
is
fearful
terror
but
terror
only
for
there
is
a
rescue
traced
close
to
the
line
of
fate
your
majesty
undoubtedly
experienced
terrible
anxiety
for
the
life
of
some
one
greatly
beloved
do
you
hear
this
ernest
said
the
king
addressing
his
son
oh
my
father
said
the
young
prince
throwing
his
arms
around
his
father
neck
then
to
benedict
yes
indeed
my
poor
father
was
in
terrible
fear
i
was
bathing
in
the
sea
at
nordeney
i
can
swim
fairly
well
but
without
perceiving
it
i
let
myself
be
carried
away
on
a
current
and
upon
my
word
i
was
on
the
point
of
sinking
when
i
grasped
the
arm
of
an
honest
fisherman
who
had
come
to
my
assistance
one
second
more
and
all
would
have
been
over
with
me
and
i
was
there
said
the
king
i
could
hear
his
cries
i
stretched
my
arms
towards
him
it
was
all
i
could
do
gloucester
offered
his
kingdom
for
a
horse
and
i
would
gladly
have
given
mine
for
a
ray
of
light
do
not
let
us
think
of
it
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
future
together
are
not
more
terrible
than
the
shadow
of
that
misfortune
which
did
not
happen
and
so
sire
said
benedict
and
so
i
am
convinced
said
the
king
i
have
no
need
of
further
proofs
let
us
pass
on
to
the
future
benedict
looked
with
great
attention
at
the
king
hand
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
asked
for
a
magnifying
glass
to
see
more
distinctly
it
was
brought
sire
he
said
you
are
about
to
be
drawn
into
a
great
war
one
of
your
nearest
neighbours
will
not
only
betray
but
will
despoil
you
and
notwithstanding
look
monseigneur
he
said
to
the
prince
the
line
of
the
sun
shows
victory
but
an
empty
victory
useless
without
fruit
and
then
asked
the
king
oh
sire
what
do
i
read
in
this
hand
good
tidings
or
bad
you
told
me
to
keep
nothing
from
you
sire
and
i
repeat
it
tell
me
then
this
victory
this
victory
as
i
have
told
your
majesty
leads
to
nothing
here
is
the
line
of
the
sun
broken
off
above
the
line
of
the
head
by
a
line
starting
from
mars
which
also
cuts
the
mount
of
jupiter
and
that
foretells
a
defeat
but
however
no
said
benedict
seeking
to
read
the
most
mysterious
secrets
from
the
royal
hand
moreover
it
is
not
the
last
word
of
your
destiny
here
is
the
line
of
the
sun
after
its
breakage
starting
afresh
reaching
the
and
stopping
at
its
base
and
there
see
further
above
this
line
traversing
jupiter
a
straight
line
like
a
furrow
crowned
with
a
star
as
a
sceptre
is
crowned
with
a
diamond
and
that
prophesies
restoration
then
according
to
you
i
shall
lose
the
throne
and
reconquer
it
benedict
turned
towards
the
prince
your
hand
if
you
please
monseigneur
the
prince
gave
him
his
hand
after
the
age
of
forty
monseigneur
the
line
of
life
sends
a
branch
towards
the
line
of
the
sun
at
that
period
you
will
ascend
the
throne
this
is
all
that
i
can
tell
you
now
if
you
ascend
the
throne
prince
it
can
only
mean
that
your
father
has
either
recovered
or
has
never
lost
it
the
king
remained
silent
for
a
moment
resting
his
head
on
his
left
hand
he
seemed
gazing
fixedly
before
him
as
if
absorbed
in
some
great
idea
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
apartment
i
can
not
tell
you
he
said
at
length
how
much
this
unknown
science
interests
me
does
providence
permit
each
of
us
to
recognize
his
destiny
in
advance
just
as
the
wrestler
of
ancient
greece
might
calculate
the
strength
of
his
adversary
in
the
circus
and
consider
how
best
to
avoid
his
grip
and
obtain
the
victory
he
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
continued
after
all
it
would
seem
only
just
only
reasonable
that
providence
which
announces
a
storm
by
gathering
clouds
and
muttering
thunder
should
allow
to
man
and
especially
to
man
placed
on
the
highest
point
of
earthly
grandeur
some
indication
of
the
approach
of
the
storms
of
life
yes
this
science
should
be
true
if
only
for
the
reason
that
it
is
necessary
and
has
hitherto
been
a
missing
link
unknown
as
it
was
in
the
harmony
of
creation
and
in
the
logic
of
the
divine
mercy
at
this
moment
an
usher
appeared
and
informed
the
king
that
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
desired
an
audience
on
account
of
important
business
the
king
turned
to
benedict
sir
said
he
though
your
predictions
are
gloomy
you
will
always
be
welcome
in
the
home
of
him
to
whom
you
have
made
them
you
have
foretold
a
victory
well
i
commission
you
to
depict
it
and
if
you
remain
with
us
it
only
rests
with
you
to
share
it
ernest
give
your
guelphic
cross
to
benedict
turpin
i
will
tell
my
minister
of
foreign
affairs
to
have
the
patent
ready
for
signature
the
king
embraced
his
son
gave
his
hand
to
kaulbach
graciously
saluted
anderson
and
benedict
and
taking
the
arm
of
his
left
the
apartment
as
he
had
entered
it
the
young
prince
detached
the
cross
and
ribbon
of
the
guelphic
order
which
decorated
his
uniform
and
fastened
them
on
benedict
coat
with
signs
of
the
most
livery
pleasure
the
latter
thanked
him
and
expressed
his
gratitude
with
evidently
heartfelt
warmth
said
the
prince
only
promise
me
one
thing
benedict
if
your
predictions
should
be
verified
and
you
should
have
nothing
better
to
do
we
will
go
on
our
travels
together
and
you
will
show
me
how
to
kill
lions
and
elephants
in
these
wonderful
forests
i
have
heard
of
chapter
xi
baron
frederic
von
bülow
and
now
we
will
leave
our
friend
benedict
turpin
in
order
to
follow
one
of
his
adversaries
who
is
destined
to
become
an
important
character
in
our
story
we
mean
baron
frederic
von
bülow
whom
we
left
with
georges
kleist
in
the
glade
of
eilenriede
although
his
wound
appeared
at
first
sight
the
more
serious
of
the
two
it
was
not
in
reality
so
moreover
he
was
the
most
eager
to
leave
the
field
entrusted
as
he
was
with
a
mission
to
frankfort
he
had
turned
aside
from
his
road
to
call
benedict
to
account
and
from
the
first
moment
that
he
was
able
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
he
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
pursuing
it
although
untouched
by
the
ball
the
impact
of
the
broken
pistol
with
the
right
side
of
kleist
face
had
had
deplorable
results
the
blow
was
so
violent
that
it
had
left
a
bruise
of
the
exact
shape
of
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
cheek
immoderately
swollen
in
short
herr
kleist
would
be
obliged
for
at
least
a
fortnight
to
forgo
the
pleasures
of
society
when
the
baron
frederic
von
bülow
and
herr
kleist
arrived
at
the
royal
hotel
they
found
their
misadventure
and
benedict
triumph
were
already
public
property
the
fact
of
their
being
prussians
was
no
recommendation
and
they
were
received
with
an
amount
of
derision
which
induced
herr
kleist
suffering
though
he
was
to
take
the
train
immediately
as
for
the
major
having
already
accomplished
a
third
of
his
journey
he
had
only
to
continue
on
a
branch
line
running
direct
from
hanover
to
frankfort
we
have
already
given
some
account
of
the
appearance
and
physique
of
the
baron
frederic
von
bülow
we
will
now
complete
our
description
first
relating
the
romantic
manner
in
which
he
entered
the
military
career
and
the
happy
chance
by
which
his
undoubted
merits
found
their
due
reward
frederic
von
bülow
came
of
a
family
belonging
to
breslau
he
had
been
a
student
at
jena
one
fine
day
he
resolved
to
make
a
tour
which
is
frequently
undertaken
by
german
students
along
the
banks
of
the
rhine
he
set
out
alone
not
that
he
was
in
the
least
misanthropical
but
he
was
a
poet
he
loved
to
travel
according
to
the
inclination
of
the
moment
to
stop
when
it
suited
him
proceed
when
he
pleased
and
have
no
companion
drawing
him
to
the
left
when
he
wanted
to
follow
a
charming
woman
to
the
right
he
had
reached
the
most
picturesque
part
of
the
rhine
the
seven
mountains
on
the
opposite
bank
on
the
summit
of
a
lofty
hill
there
stood
a
fine
gothic
castle
lately
restored
it
belonged
to
the
brother
of
the
king
of
prussia
who
was
then
only
the
prince
royal
not
only
had
he
rebuilt
the
castle
on
its
ancient
foundations
but
he
had
furnished
it
throughout
with
appointments
of
the
sixteenth
century
collected
in
the
neighbourhood
from
the
peasantry
and
convents
and
new
pieces
made
by
clever
workmen
from
ancient
models
hangings
tapestries
mirrors
all
were
of
the
same
period
and
formed
a
charming
miniature
museum
of
arms
pictures
and
valuable
curiosities
when
the
prince
was
not
in
residence
he
allowed
the
castle
to
be
shown
to
visitors
of
distinction
how
difficult
it
is
to
define
the
phrase
visitors
of
distinction
frederic
whose
family
was
of
ancient
nobility
considered
that
he
had
a
right
though
travelling
on
foot
to
see
the
castle
knapsack
on
shoulder
staff
in
hand
he
climbed
the
steep
path
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
keep
the
sound
of
a
horn
was
heard
and
the
door
opened
a
porter
appeared
and
an
officer
in
the
costume
of
the
sixteenth
century
who
asked
what
could
be
done
for
him
frederic
von
bülow
explained
his
wish
as
an
archæologist
to
see
the
prince
regent
castle
the
officer
replied
regretting
he
was
not
able
to
gratify
him
the
intendant
had
arrived
the
evening
before
preceding
his
master
only
by
hours
visitors
could
no
longer
be
admitted
but
the
traveller
was
invited
according
to
custom
to
inscribe
his
name
titles
and
qualifications
in
the
visitors
book
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
frederic
von
bülow
student
of
the
university
of
jena
then
he
took
up
his
stick
saluted
the
officer
and
began
to
descend
the
path
but
he
had
not
taken
a
hundred
steps
when
he
heard
himself
called
the
officer
beckoned
and
a
page
ran
after
him
saying
the
intendant
begged
him
to
return
and
would
take
upon
himself
to
grant
the
desired
permission
to
see
the
castle
in
the
frederic
met
as
if
by
chance
a
man
of
about
or
sixty
it
was
the
prince
intendant
he
entered
into
conversation
with
the
young
man
appeared
pleased
with
him
and
offered
to
be
his
guide
throughout
the
castle
an
offer
that
frederic
took
good
care
to
accept
the
intendant
was
very
well
informed
frederic
was
a
young
man
of
ability
and
three
or
four
hours
had
passed
without
either
being
aware
how
the
time
was
going
when
a
servant
announced
dinner
frederic
gracefully
expressed
his
concern
at
leaving
his
cicerone
so
soon
and
his
regret
was
evidently
shared
by
his
guide
see
here
he
said
you
are
travelling
as
a
student
i
am
here
suppose
you
dine
with
me
you
will
not
dine
so
well
as
you
might
with
the
king
but
at
any
rate
it
will
be
better
than
hotel
fare
frederic
protested
as
far
as
he
thought
good
breeding
demanded
but
as
he
was
really
longing
to
accept
the
invitation
he
ended
by
acceding
with
visible
pleasure
and
they
consequently
dined
together
frederic
was
a
delightful
companion
being
both
poet
and
philosopher
qualities
one
finds
only
united
in
germany
he
quite
made
a
conquest
of
his
host
who
after
dinner
proposed
a
game
of
chess
midnight
struck
and
each
thought
the
evening
barely
begun
it
was
not
possible
to
return
to
the
village
at
such
an
hour
frederic
after
some
modest
reluctance
remained
at
the
castle
and
slept
in
the
landgrave
philip
bed
and
it
was
only
the
next
day
after
lunch
that
he
obtained
his
host
permission
to
resume
his
journey
i
am
not
without
some
slight
influence
at
court
said
the
intendant
on
taking
leave
of
him
and
if
i
can
ever
be
of
any
service
to
you
pray
make
use
of
me
frederic
promised
that
he
would
and
whatever
may
happen
added
his
host
i
shall
remember
your
name
you
may
forget
me
but
i
shall
not
forget
you
frederic
finished
his
travels
on
the
rhine
returned
to
the
university
of
jena
concluded
his
studies
there
entered
the
diplomatic
service
and
was
greatly
astonished
at
being
one
day
summoned
to
the
cabinet
of
the
grand
duke
sir
said
the
great
man
i
have
selected
you
to
convey
my
congratulations
to
william
the
first
king
of
prussia
on
his
recent
accession
to
the
throne
but
highness
cried
frederic
in
astonishment
who
am
i
to
be
honoured
with
such
a
commission
really
are
you
not
baron
frederic
von
bülow
highness
baron
i
but
since
when
have
i
become
a
baron
since
i
made
you
one
you
will
start
at
nine
your
letters
of
credit
will
be
ready
at
eight
frederic
could
only
bow
and
utter
his
thanks
he
bowed
deeply
gratefully
thanked
the
grand
duke
and
left
the
room
the
next
morning
at
ten
he
was
in
the
train
and
by
the
evening
he
was
in
berlin
his
arrival
was
immediately
announced
to
the
new
king
the
new
king
replied
that
he
would
receive
him
the
following
day
at
the
castle
of
potsdam
on
the
morrow
frederic
in
his
court
suit
started
for
potsdam
and
arrived
at
the
castle
but
to
his
great
astonishment
he
learnt
that
the
king
had
just
gone
away
and
had
left
only
his
intendant
to
represent
him
frederic
first
idea
was
to
return
to
berlin
but
he
remembered
that
it
was
this
official
who
had
entertained
him
so
kindly
and
courteously
two
years
before
at
the
castle
of
rheinstein
he
did
not
want
to
appear
ungrateful
or
offended
so
had
his
name
sent
in
accordingly
but
while
crossing
the
he
observed
a
portrait
of
the
king
he
stopped
for
an
instant
stupefied
his
majesty
resembled
his
intendant
as
one
drop
of
water
resembles
another
the
truth
now
dawned
on
frederic
it
was
the
king
brother
himself
who
reigning
as
king
william
i
had
received
him
at
the
castle
of
rheinstein
who
had
acted
as
his
guide
had
kept
him
to
dinner
who
had
won
three
games
of
chess
out
of
five
and
had
made
him
sleep
in
the
landgrave
philip
bed
who
had
offered
his
influence
at
court
and
who
on
taking
leave
of
him
had
promised
not
to
forget
him
he
understood
now
why
he
had
been
chosen
by
the
grand
duke
of
weimar
to
carry
his
congratulations
to
the
king
why
the
grand
duke
of
weimar
had
made
him
a
baron
why
the
king
had
appointed
a
meeting
at
potsdam
and
why
finally
his
majesty
had
returned
to
berlin
leaving
his
intendant
only
to
represent
him
his
majesty
wanted
to
enjoy
another
day
like
that
they
had
passed
together
at
rheinstein
frederic
was
a
good
courtier
and
was
ready
to
contribute
all
in
his
power
to
this
caprice
he
entered
as
if
he
had
no
suspicion
greeted
his
host
like
an
old
acquaintance
only
showing
the
respect
due
to
an
older
man
thus
recalling
the
scene
which
had
left
such
a
pleasing
influence
on
his
mind
the
intendant
made
excuses
for
his
majesty
and
invited
frederic
to
pass
the
day
at
the
castle
of
potsdam
an
invitation
which
was
accepted
like
the
one
at
rheinstein
he
again
offered
his
services
as
cicerone
took
him
into
the
mausoleum
and
showed
him
the
tomb
and
the
sword
of
the
great
frederic
a
court
carriage
was
ready
waiting
for
them
and
they
went
to
see
the
castle
of
which
is
only
two
miles
from
potsdam
it
was
here
it
will
be
remembered
in
the
park
of
this
château
that
the
famous
mill
was
situated
which
its
owner
refused
to
sell
to
frederic
ii
and
which
caused
the
king
to
exclaim
when
the
miller
gained
his
lawsuit
so
there
are
still
judges
at
berlin
in
the
sequel
the
descendants
of
the
stubborn
miller
were
softened
and
sold
their
mill
to
william
i
who
wishing
to
preserve
it
as
a
monument
of
the
occurrence
refused
to
allow
it
to
be
demolished
but
time
which
cares
nothing
for
the
commands
of
kings
had
in
store
for
william
and
his
guest
an
example
of
its
disregard
an
hour
before
the
arrival
of
frederic
and
the
agent
the
four
sails
of
the
windmill
had
fallen
bringing
down
in
their
fall
the
balustrade
which
surrounded
it
so
that
to
day
one
must
conclude
that
there
are
no
longer
judges
in
berlin
as
there
is
no
longer
a
mill
at
on
their
return
to
potsdam
frederic
and
his
companion
found
a
table
ready
laid
for
two
they
dined
alone
together
played
five
games
of
chess
out
of
which
the
agent
won
three
and
it
was
only
at
midnight
that
they
separated
when
on
the
agent
wishing
frederic
a
good
night
the
latter
replied
with
a
deep
bow
sire
may
god
grant
your
majesty
a
good
night
the
next
day
the
fiction
was
abandoned
the
king
breakfasted
with
frederic
gave
him
the
order
of
the
red
eagle
and
with
much
pressing
induced
him
to
hand
in
his
resignation
and
join
the
army
a
week
later
he
received
his
commission
as
lieutenant
of
the
line
and
came
to
pay
his
respects
in
his
new
character
to
the
king
who
undertook
that
the
king
would
ever
remember
him
whom
the
prince
had
promised
not
to
forget
two
years
later
frederic
received
a
proof
that
the
king
indeed
had
not
forgotten
his
regiment
was
stationed
in
garrison
at
frankfort
where
at
the
house
of
herr
fellner
the
burgomaster
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
family
of
french
descent
exiled
by
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
which
had
since
its
expatriation
become
catholic
the
family
consisted
of
the
mother
aged
about
the
grandmother
who
was
and
two
girls
of
twenty
and
eighteen
their
family
name
was
chandroz
the
elder
daughter
emma
had
black
hair
black
eyes
a
pale
clear
skin
and
eyebrows
her
marvellously
beautiful
teeth
showed
like
pearls
against
her
vividly
red
lips
she
had
in
fact
that
stately
dark
beauty
which
suggests
the
roman
matron
lucretia
and
cornelia
in
one
helen
was
worthy
of
her
name
her
hair
was
of
that
exquisite
blonde
tint
which
can
only
be
compared
to
the
colour
of
ripe
corn
her
complexion
faintly
tinted
with
rose
had
the
freshness
and
delicacy
of
the
camellia
and
the
effect
was
almost
astonishing
when
under
these
fair
locks
and
upon
that
countenance
of
almost
transparent
pallor
she
raised
large
dark
eyes
eloquent
of
passion
overarched
with
dark
eyebrows
and
fringed
with
lashes
which
gave
to
their
sparkling
orbs
deep
reflections
like
those
of
the
black
diamonds
of
tripoli
and
as
one
had
only
to
look
at
emma
to
see
foreshadowed
in
her
the
calm
and
wisdom
of
those
matrons
among
whom
the
catholic
religion
finds
its
saints
so
one
could
divine
in
helen
all
that
tempestuous
future
which
the
united
passions
of
two
races
hold
in
store
for
the
hybrids
of
their
sex
whether
it
were
that
this
strange
manifestation
of
divine
caprice
dismayed
him
or
whether
he
felt
himself
drawn
by
irresistible
sympathy
to
the
elder
of
the
two
sisters
it
was
to
her
that
the
baron
von
bülow
paid
his
homage
he
was
young
handsome
and
rich
it
was
known
that
the
king
of
prussia
held
him
in
warm
regard
he
stated
that
if
he
were
granted
emma
hand
his
royal
protector
at
the
same
time
would
make
him
a
captain
the
two
young
people
were
in
love
and
the
family
had
no
serious
opposition
to
raise
to
their
union
they
said
obtain
your
promotion
as
captain
and
we
will
see
he
asked
three
days
leave
started
for
berlin
and
came
back
on
the
third
day
with
his
commission
all
was
arranged
but
during
his
absence
emma
mother
was
slightly
indisposed
her
illness
increased
developed
into
disease
of
the
lungs
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
emma
was
doubly
orphaned
it
was
a
further
reason
for
giving
the
family
a
protector
the
grandmother
years
of
age
might
die
at
any
moment
they
waited
till
the
strict
season
of
mourning
dictated
both
by
their
hearts
and
by
custom
had
elapsed
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
they
were
married
three
days
after
the
birth
of
his
first
child
a
boy
the
baron
frederic
von
bülow
received
his
commission
as
major
on
this
occasion
the
protection
of
the
king
was
so
obvious
and
so
kindly
intentioned
that
the
baron
resolved
to
make
a
second
journey
to
berlin
not
on
this
occasion
to
ask
for
favours
but
to
return
thanks
for
them
this
journey
was
all
the
more
opportune
because
a
word
dropped
by
his
majesty
secretary
had
warned
him
that
there
were
great
events
on
the
horizon
in
which
he
might
take
part
and
that
he
would
do
wisely
to
come
to
berlin
on
any
suitable
pretext
and
see
the
king
in
person
and
in
fact
we
have
already
said
that
count
von
bismarck
had
worked
hard
to
bring
great
events
to
pass
the
king
had
three
times
received
baron
frederic
in
private
and
had
freely
discussed
with
him
the
probability
of
a
terrible
war
to
crown
all
he
attached
him
to
the
staff
so
that
he
might
become
to
any
general
whom
he
sent
to
any
special
place
or
even
at
need
to
his
son
or
his
cousin
this
was
how
baron
frederic
chanced
to
find
himself
at
berlin
on
june
that
is
on
the
day
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
bismarck
as
we
have
seen
he
with
two
other
officers
rescued
benedict
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
but
having
promised
the
crowd
that
the
frenchman
should
shout
long
live
prussia
long
live
king
william
i
he
was
confounded
when
instead
of
adopting
this
prudent
course
benedict
declaimed
alfred
de
musset
verses
on
the
rhine
almost
as
well
known
in
prussia
as
the
song
to
which
they
were
an
answer
he
and
his
comrades
took
this
affront
which
the
public
had
witnessed
as
a
deliberate
insult
all
three
presented
themselves
at
the
black
eagle
which
benedict
as
we
know
had
given
as
his
address
intending
to
demand
immediate
satisfaction
but
as
they
met
each
other
and
learnt
that
their
errands
were
all
the
same
they
recognized
that
three
men
who
do
not
wish
to
gain
their
end
by
intimidation
can
not
all
demand
satisfaction
from
a
single
opponent
for
this
reason
they
cast
lots
as
to
who
should
have
the
honour
of
fighting
with
benedict
and
the
lot
as
we
have
seen
fell
upon
frederic
chapter
xii
helen
there
stands
in
at
the
corner
of
the
opposite
the
protestant
church
of
catherine
a
mansion
which
by
its
architecture
belongs
to
the
transition
period
between
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
it
is
known
as
passevent
house
the
was
occupied
by
a
bookseller
and
all
the
rest
by
the
chandroz
family
already
known
to
the
reader
by
name
a
sort
of
uneasiness
not
quite
amounting
to
actual
trouble
seemed
to
prevail
in
the
house
the
morning
before
a
letter
had
been
received
by
baroness
von
bülow
announcing
her
husband
return
in
the
evening
and
close
upon
that
came
a
telegram
saying
that
he
would
not
arrive
before
the
following
morning
and
that
she
must
not
be
anxious
if
there
were
a
further
delay
the
fact
was
that
two
hours
after
writing
his
letter
the
baron
saw
benedict
announcement
in
the
gazette
fearing
that
he
might
be
delayed
by
a
wound
he
wished
to
spare
his
wife
any
possible
anxiety
her
infant
being
only
just
over
a
week
old
although
the
train
was
not
due
until
four
in
the
morning
hans
the
confidential
servant
of
the
family
had
already
departed
at
three
taking
the
carriage
to
meet
his
master
at
the
station
and
at
least
ten
times
during
the
interval
emma
rang
up
her
maid
wondering
why
the
time
passed
so
slowly
at
length
the
sound
of
a
carriage
was
heard
followed
by
the
creaking
of
the
great
gate
the
carriage
passed
under
the
arch
the
tread
of
spurred
boots
echoed
on
the
staircase
emma
door
opened
and
emma
arms
enfolded
her
husband
it
did
not
escape
her
notice
that
frederic
winced
when
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
she
asked
the
cause
frederic
replied
with
a
story
of
a
cab
accident
in
which
he
had
slightly
sprained
his
arm
the
sound
of
the
carriage
and
the
general
movement
in
the
house
informed
helen
of
the
baron
arrival
hastily
wrapping
herself
in
a
with
her
beautiful
hair
falling
loosely
over
it
she
hurried
to
greet
her
whom
she
loved
tenderly
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
countess
de
chandroz
their
grandmother
orders
had
been
given
to
keep
her
wing
of
the
house
as
quiet
as
possible
madame
von
bülow
with
the
usual
penetration
of
wives
soon
guessed
that
frederic
arm
was
more
hurt
than
he
chose
to
acknowledge
she
insisted
that
the
family
doctor
herr
bodemacker
should
be
sent
for
and
frederic
who
knew
by
the
pain
he
suffered
that
the
bandage
must
have
been
displaced
during
his
journey
made
no
objection
he
only
begged
her
to
keep
quiet
while
he
went
to
his
own
room
for
the
bath
he
had
ordered
saying
that
it
would
be
much
better
for
the
doctor
to
follow
him
there
and
decide
which
of
his
two
hundred
and
bones
required
attention
the
question
of
importance
was
to
keep
the
baroness
in
ignorance
as
to
the
serious
nature
of
the
wound
with
the
help
of
hans
and
the
connivance
of
the
doctor
this
would
be
easy
the
bath
was
a
marvellous
help
and
emma
allowed
him
to
go
to
his
room
without
suspecting
the
real
cause
of
his
requiring
it
when
the
doctor
arrived
frederic
astonished
hans
by
explaining
that
the
evening
before
he
had
received
a
sword
wound
which
had
laid
open
his
arm
that
the
bandage
must
have
slipped
in
the
train
and
that
it
his
coat
and
his
shirt
were
all
soaked
in
blood
the
doctor
slit
the
sleeve
the
whole
way
up
and
then
cut
it
clear
at
the
top
frederic
then
was
told
to
plunge
his
arm
into
the
warm
water
of
the
bath
which
enabled
the
doctor
to
remove
the
coat
sleeve
he
then
loosened
the
shirt
sleeve
by
sponging
it
with
the
warm
water
and
finally
cutting
it
away
at
the
shoulder
was
able
to
expose
the
wound
the
arm
compressed
by
the
sleeves
was
frightfully
red
and
swollen
the
plaster
had
given
way
the
wound
was
gaping
widely
through
its
whole
length
and
in
the
lower
part
the
arm
appeared
cut
to
the
bone
it
was
fortunate
that
there
had
been
plenty
of
warm
water
at
hand
the
doctor
brought
the
two
sides
of
the
cut
together
again
fixed
them
carefully
bandaged
the
whole
arm
and
put
it
in
splints
as
if
it
had
been
broken
but
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
the
baron
should
remain
quite
quiet
for
two
or
three
days
the
doctor
undertook
to
find
the
general
in
command
and
to
explain
privately
that
baron
von
bülow
was
charged
with
a
mission
to
him
but
could
not
possibly
leave
the
house
hans
quickly
removed
the
water
and
stained
bandages
frederic
went
down
kissed
his
wife
and
satisfied
her
by
saying
the
doctor
had
merely
ordered
him
to
rest
for
a
few
days
the
word
dislocation
spread
through
the
house
and
accounted
for
the
baron
indisposition
returning
to
his
own
apartment
he
found
the
prussian
general
awaiting
him
he
explained
matters
in
two
words
moreover
before
long
the
story
would
be
in
all
the
papers
the
important
question
was
to
keep
the
baroness
in
ignorance
she
would
be
uneasy
about
a
dislocation
but
in
despair
over
a
wound
frederic
handed
over
his
despatches
to
the
general
they
merely
warned
him
to
be
ready
for
action
at
a
moment
notice
it
was
evident
that
count
bismarck
from
whom
the
order
came
wished
to
have
a
garrison
at
hand
during
the
diet
to
overawe
the
assembly
if
possible
afterwards
he
would
withdraw
it
or
leave
it
according
to
circumstances
this
question
would
be
put
to
the
diet
in
case
of
war
between
austria
and
prussia
on
which
side
will
you
be
frederic
was
extremely
anxious
to
see
his
young
sister
helen
having
important
communications
to
make
after
he
and
benedict
had
vowed
eternal
friendship
on
the
field
of
battle
and
benedict
had
spoken
of
having
met
the
baroness
at
the
burgomaster
house
he
had
conceived
an
idea
which
he
could
not
drive
away
namely
to
marry
benedict
to
his
from
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
the
young
man
he
felt
convinced
that
these
two
impetuous
imaginative
and
artistic
characters
always
ready
to
pursue
an
idea
suggested
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
or
a
scented
breeze
were
out
of
the
whole
creation
the
best
suited
to
each
other
consequently
he
wished
to
ascertain
if
helen
had
been
attracted
by
his
friend
were
this
the
case
he
would
find
some
pretext
for
bringing
benedict
to
frankfort
and
little
as
helen
cared
for
admiration
he
thought
the
acquaintance
would
soon
assume
the
character
he
wished
moreover
he
wished
to
warn
helen
to
keep
newspapers
away
from
her
sister
and
grandmother
and
on
this
account
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
she
anticipated
his
wishes
for
scarcely
had
the
general
left
him
when
some
one
knocked
softly
at
his
door
such
a
knock
as
might
have
proceeded
from
a
cat
or
a
bird
he
knew
helen
gentle
manner
of
announcing
herself
come
in
little
sister
come
in
he
cried
and
helen
entered
on
the
baron
was
lying
on
his
bed
in
his
lying
on
his
left
side
his
wounded
arm
extended
along
his
body
ah
you
said
she
folding
her
arms
and
gazing
at
him
so
you
have
been
and
gone
and
done
it
have
you
how
done
what
enquired
frederic
laughing
well
now
i
have
got
you
alone
we
can
talk
exactly
dear
helen
now
we
are
alone
as
you
say
you
are
the
person
of
this
house
although
no
one
else
knows
it
not
even
yourself
so
i
want
to
discuss
important
matters
with
you
and
they
are
not
a
few
so
do
i
and
i
shall
begin
by
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
your
arm
is
not
dislocated
nor
even
sprained
you
have
fought
a
duel
like
the
hothead
you
are
and
your
arm
is
wounded
by
either
a
sabre
or
well
my
little
sister
that
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
did
fight
a
duel
for
political
reasons
and
i
did
get
a
sabre
cut
in
my
arm
but
it
was
a
friendly
sabre
very
neatly
and
prettily
applied
it
is
not
dangerous
no
artery
or
nerve
severed
but
the
story
will
be
in
all
the
papers
it
has
made
noise
enough
already
now
we
must
prevent
both
grandmamma
and
emma
from
seeing
the
newspapers
the
only
paper
taken
here
is
the
zeitung
which
is
precisely
the
one
that
will
say
the
most
what
are
you
smiling
at
i
ca
help
thinking
of
the
face
of
the
man
who
will
have
to
supply
the
details
what
do
you
mean
nothing
i
was
only
talking
to
myself
and
when
i
say
things
to
myself
they
are
not
worth
repeating
aloud
the
question
is
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
zeitung
certainly
i
will
keep
an
eye
on
it
then
i
need
not
trouble
any
more
about
it
when
i
tell
you
that
i
will
see
to
it
myself
very
well
we
will
talk
about
something
else
about
anything
you
like
do
you
recollect
meeting
a
young
frenchman
at
herr
fellner
an
artist
a
painter
monsieur
benedict
turpin
i
should
think
so
a
charming
man
who
makes
the
most
rapid
sketches
and
though
they
are
flattering
they
are
still
likenesses
oh
come
come
you
are
quite
enthusiastic
i
can
show
you
one
he
did
of
me
he
has
given
me
a
pair
of
wings
and
i
really
look
like
an
angel
then
he
is
clever
enormously
clever
and
witty
he
can
certainly
give
you
as
good
as
you
gave
you
should
have
seen
how
he
routed
some
of
our
bankers
when
they
tried
to
chaff
him
he
spoke
better
german
than
they
did
is
he
rich
as
well
so
they
say
it
also
seems
as
if
there
were
remarkable
affinities
between
his
character
and
that
of
a
little
girl
i
know
but
who
i
do
understand
nevertheless
it
is
some
one
you
know
he
appears
to
be
capricious
imaginative
vivacious
he
adores
travelling
is
an
excellent
rider
and
a
good
sportsman
either
on
foot
or
horseback
all
which
coincides
admirably
with
the
tastes
of
a
certain
vernon
i
thought
that
was
what
you
always
called
me
so
it
is
do
you
recognize
my
portrait
not
at
all
not
in
the
least
i
am
gentle
calm
collected
i
like
travelling
yes
but
where
have
i
been
to
paris
berlin
vienna
london
and
that
is
all
i
love
horses
but
what
do
i
ever
ride
except
my
poor
little
gretchen
she
has
nearly
killed
you
twice
over
poor
thing
it
was
my
own
fault
as
for
shooting
i
have
never
held
a
gun
and
as
for
coursing
i
have
never
started
a
hare
true
but
why
not
only
because
the
grandmother
objected
if
you
could
have
had
your
own
way
oh
yes
it
would
be
glorious
to
rush
against
the
wind
to
feel
it
blowing
through
one
hair
there
is
great
pleasure
in
rapid
motion
a
feeling
of
life
which
one
finds
in
nothing
else
so
you
would
like
to
be
able
to
do
these
things
which
you
do
do
yes
indeed
with
monsieur
benedict
why
monsieur
benedict
more
than
any
one
else
because
he
is
more
charming
than
most
i
do
not
think
so
really
no
then
supposing
you
were
allowed
to
choose
a
husband
out
of
all
my
friends
you
would
not
choose
m
benedict
i
should
never
dream
of
doing
so
now
little
sister
you
know
i
am
an
obstinate
man
who
likes
to
understand
things
how
is
it
that
a
man
young
handsome
rich
talented
courageous
and
imaginative
fails
to
interest
you
particularly
when
he
has
both
the
good
qualities
and
the
defects
of
your
own
character
what
am
i
to
say
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
analyse
my
feelings
some
people
are
sympathetic
to
me
some
indifferent
some
downright
disagreeable
well
you
do
class
monsieur
benedict
among
the
disagreeable
i
hope
no
but
among
the
indifferents
and
why
among
the
indifferents
monsieur
benedict
is
of
medium
height
i
like
tall
men
he
is
fair
i
like
dark
men
he
is
volatile
i
like
serious
people
he
is
bold
always
rushing
off
to
the
ends
of
the
world
he
would
be
the
husband
of
other
men
wives
and
not
even
the
lover
of
his
own
let
us
resume
what
sort
of
man
then
must
he
be
that
would
please
you
somebody
just
the
opposite
of
m
benedict
he
must
be
tall
yes
dark
either
dark
or
dark
chestnut
grave
grave
or
at
least
serious
also
brave
steady
loyal
and
just
so
do
you
know
that
you
have
described
word
for
word
my
friend
karl
von
freyberg
helen
blushed
crimson
and
moved
quickly
as
if
to
leave
the
room
but
frederic
disregarding
his
wound
caught
her
hand
and
made
her
sit
down
again
the
light
from
between
the
curtains
irradiated
her
face
like
the
sunlight
falling
on
a
flower
he
looked
at
her
intently
well
yes
she
said
but
no
one
knows
but
you
not
karl
himself
he
may
have
some
idea
well
little
sister
said
frederic
i
see
no
great
harm
in
all
this
come
and
kiss
me
and
we
will
talk
again
another
time
but
how
comes
it
exclaimed
helen
with
vexation
that
you
know
all
you
want
to
know
although
i
have
told
you
nothing
at
all
because
one
can
see
through
a
crystal
which
is
pure
dear
little
helen
karl
von
freyberg
is
my
best
friend
he
has
all
i
could
wish
in
a
or
that
you
could
desire
in
a
husband
if
he
loves
you
as
much
as
you
seem
to
love
him
there
should
be
no
great
difficulty
about
your
becoming
his
wife
ah
dear
frederic
said
helen
shaking
her
pretty
head
but
i
once
heard
a
frenchwoman
say
that
the
marriages
which
present
no
difficulties
are
just
those
which
never
come
off
and
she
retired
to
her
own
room
wondering
no
doubt
as
to
what
difficulties
destiny
could
interpose
to
the
completion
of
her
own
marriage

karl
von

in
the
days
of
charles

the

dominated
for
a
period
both
europe
and

both
the

and

could
watch

setting
when
the
last
ray
of
sunset
sank
in
the
west
the
first
light
of
dawn
was
reappearing
in
the
east
her
empire
was
greater
than
that
of
alexander
of
augustus
of
charlemagne
but
this
empire
has
been
torn
by
the
devouring
hands
of
time
and
the
champion
by
whom
the
armour
of
this
colossus
piece
by
piece
has
been
rent
away
is
france
france
took
for
herself
flanders
the
duchy
of
bar
burgundy
alsace
and
lorraine
for
the
grandson
of
louis
xiv
she
took
spain

and
the
islands
for
the
son
of
philip

she
took
naples
and
sicily
she
also
took
the
netherlands
and
made
two
separate
kingdoms
of
them
belgium
and
holland
and
finally
she
tore
away
lombardy
and
venetia
and
gave
them
to
italy
and
the
boundaries
of
this
empire

every

that
strictly
speaking
there
is
no

properly
so
called
only
a
dukedom
of
austria
with
nine
to
ten
millions
of
inhabitants
of
which
vienna
is
the
capital
and
it
was
a

who
imprisoned

his

from

and
only
released
him
on
payment
of
a
ransom
of

we
do
not
count
four

millions
of

scattered
throughout
hungary
and
on
the
banks
of
the

every
one
of
the
above

has
its
own
character
its
own
customs
language
costume
frontier
especially
the
dwellers
in
styria
composed
of
norica
and
the
ancient
pannonia
have
retained
their
own
language
costume
and
primitive
customs
before
it
became
included
in
austria
styria
had
its
own
separate
history
and
nobility
dating
from
the
time
when
it
was
known
as
the
march
of
styria
about
and
from
that
epoch
karl
von
freyberg
dated
his
ancestry
remaining
a
great
noble
at
a
time
when
great
nobles
are
becoming
rare
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
of
about
tall
straight
slight
flexible
as
a
cane
and
equally
tough
his
fine
black
hair
was
cut
close
and
he
had
beneath
black
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
those
dark
grey
eyes
which
homer
attributes
to
minerva
and
which
shine
like
emeralds
his
complexion
was
sunburnt
for
he
had
hunted
since
childhood
he
had
small
hands
and
feet
unwearied
limbs
and
prodigious
strength
in
his
own
mountains
he
had
hunted
bear
wild
goat
and
chamois
but
he
had
never
attacked
the
first
of
these
animals
with
any
weapon
except
lance
or
dagger
he
was
now
a
captain
in
the
lichtenstein
hussars
and
even
in
barracks
was
always
followed
by
two
tyrolean
chasseurs
dressed
in
the
national
costume
while
the
one
carried
out
an
order
the
other
remained
at
hand
so
that
there
might
be
always
some
one
to
whom
his
master
might
say
go
and
do
this
although
they
understood
german
he
always
spoke
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
they
were
serfs
understanding
nothing
about
enfranchisement
who
considered
that
he
had
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
over
them
and
although
he
had
several
times
tried
to
explain
matters
telling
them
they
were
free
to
go
where
they
chose
they
had
simply
refused
either
to
believe
or
to
listen
three
years
before
during
a
chamois
hunt
one
of
his
keepers
lost
his
footing
he
fell
down
a
precipice
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
karl
ordered
his
steward
to
pay
the
widow
an
annuity
she
thanked
him
but
was
quite
unable
to
understand
that
he
owed
her
anything
merely
because
her
husband
had
been
killed
in
his
service
when
there
was
a
hunt
and
he
who
writes
this
had
twice
the
honour
to
be
of
the
party
whether
in
his
own
country
or
not
karl
always
wore
his
national
costume
and
very
picturesque
it
was
the
count
two
attendants
never
left
him
they
were
loaders
when
karl
had
fired
he
dropped
his
gun
on
the
ground
and
another
ready
loaded
was
instantly
slipped
into
his
hand
whilst
waiting
for
the
beaters
to
be
placed
which
generally
took
half
an
hour
the
two
chasseurs
drew
from
their
small
tyrolean
flutes
made
of
reeds
on
which
they
played
sometimes
together
sometimes
alone
but
always
joining
again
after
a
certain
number
of
bars
styrian
airs
melancholy
but
sweet
and
plaintive
this
lasted
some
minutes
then
as
if
drawn
by
the
music
the
count
in
his
turn
produced
a
similar
flute
and
put
it
to
his
lips
he
now
took
up
the
melody
the
others
only
played
accompaniments
which
i
think
must
have
been
improvised
so
original
were
they
it
seemed
as
if
the
accompaniments
pursued
the
air
overtook
it
and
then
turned
around
it
like
creepers
or
tendrils
then
the
air
reappeared
charming
but
always
sad
and
reaching
notes
so
high
that
one
would
have
thought
only
silver
or
glass
could
produce
them
then
a
gun
was
heard
that
of
the
chief
beater
announcing
that
all
was
ready
the
three
flutes
vanished
inside
the
the
musicians
took
their
guns
and
again
became
hunters
ear
and
eye
strained
to
the
utmost
count
karl
knocked
at
eleven
at
baron
von
bülow
door
having
heard
both
of
his
return
and
his
accident
frederic
received
him
with
an
unusually
smiling
countenance
but
only
offered
his
left
hand
ah
then
it
is
true
is
it
i
have
just
read
the
zeitung
what
have
you
read
my
dear
karl
i
read
that
you
fought
with
a
frenchman
and
were
wounded
hush
not
so
loud
i
am
not
wounded
for
the
family
only
dislocated
what
does
that
mean
it
means
my
dear
fellow
that
my
wife
wo
think
she
need
inspect
a
sprained
arm
but
she
would
positively
insist
on
examining
a
wounded
one
now
she
would
die
of
fright
over
this
wound
while
i
believe
you
would
rather
like
to
have
it
have
you
seen
many
wounds
a
foot
long
i
can
show
you
one
if
you
like
how
so
a
skilled
fencer
like
you
who
uses
his
sabre
as
if
he
had
invented
it
none
the
less
i
found
my
master
a
frenchman
a
frenchman
well
instead
of
hunting
wild
boar
in
the
taunus
as
i
intended
i
should
like
to
go
and
hunt
your
frenchman
and
bring
back
one
of
his
paws
to
replace
your
wounded
one
do
do
anything
of
the
kind
my
dear
friend
you
might
easily
only
bring
back
a
nice
little
cut
like
this
of
mine
besides
the
frenchman
is
now
my
friend
and
i
want
him
to
be
yours
also
never
a
rascal
who
has
cut
your
arm
open
how
far
a
foot
did
you
say
he
might
have
killed
me
he
did
not
he
might
have
cut
me
in
two
and
he
only
gave
me
this
wound
we
embraced
on
the
battlefield
did
you
see
the
other
details
what
other
details
those
concerning
his
other
duel
with
herr
george
kleist
superficially
i
do
know
him
i
only
cared
about
you
i
did
see
that
your
frenchman
had
damaged
the
jaw
of
some
man
who
writes
articles
in
the
zeitung
he
seems
to
have
quarrelled
with
two
professions
since
he
chooses
to
encounter
an
officer
and
a
journalist
on
the
same
day
he
did
not
choose
us
we
were
foolish
enough
to
choose
him
we
pursued
him
to
hanover
where
he
was
very
comfortable
probably
he
was
annoyed
by
being
disturbed
so
he
sent
me
home
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
and
dismissed
herr
kleist
with
a
black
eye
is
the
fellow
a
hercules
not
at
all
it
is
curious
he
is
a
head
shorter
than
you
but
formed
like
alfred
de
musset
hassan
whose
mother
made
him
small
in
order
to
turn
him
out
perfect
and
so
you
embraced
on
the
battlefield
better
still
i
have
an
idea
what
is
it
he
is
a
frenchman
as
you
know
of
good
family
dear
friend
they
are
all
of
good
family
since
the
revolution
but
he
is
clever
very
as
a
fencing
master
not
at
all
as
an
artist
kaulbach
says
he
is
the
hope
of
the
present
school
he
is
young
young
yes
or
six
at
most
and
handsome
handsome
as
well
charming
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
trifle
not
everybody
has
two
hundred
thousand
like
you
my
dear
friend
twelve
thousand
francs
and
a
fine
talent
might
mean
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
but
why
in
the
world
do
you
consider
all
this
i
should
like
him
to
marry
helen
the
count
nearly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
what
let
him
marry
helen
your
a
frenchman
well
is
she
not
herself
partly
of
french
origin
i
am
sure
mademoiselle
helen
loves
you
too
much
to
be
willing
to
marry
a
man
who
has
wounded
you
like
this
i
hope
she
refused
she
did
the
count
breathed
again
but
what
the
deuce
put
such
an
idea
into
your
head
as
to
marry
him
to
your
sister
she
is
only
my
that
does
not
matter
what
an
idea
to
think
of
marrying
to
the
first
person
picked
up
on
the
high
road
i
assure
you
this
young
man
is
not
just
never
mind
she
refused
did
she
not
that
is
the
chief
thing
i
hope
to
make
her
think
better
of
it
you
must
be
quite
mad
but
tell
me
why
should
she
refuse
explain
if
you
can
unless
indeed
she
cares
for
some
one
else
the
count
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
do
you
think
that
quite
impossible
he
stammered
no
but
then
if
she
should
love
someone
else
she
must
say
so
listen
frederic
i
can
not
positively
say
that
she
loves
some
one
else
but
i
can
declare
that
some
one
else
loves
her
that
is
half
the
battle
is
it
some
one
as
good
as
my
frenchman
ah
frederic
you
are
so
prejudiced
in
favour
of
your
frenchman
i
dare
not
say
yes
then
tell
me
at
once
you
see
what
might
have
happened
had
my
frenchman
been
here
and
i
had
made
any
promise
to
him
well
at
any
rate
you
wo
turn
me
out
for
saying
it
the
some
one
is
myself
always
modest
loyal
and
true
dear
karl
but
but
i
will
have
no
it
is
not
a
very
terrible
as
you
will
see
you
are
a
great
noble
karl
compared
to
my
little
sister
helen
i
am
the
last
of
my
race
there
is
no
one
to
make
objections
and
you
are
very
rich
for
a
dowry
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
i
can
dispose
of
my
own
fortune
as
i
choose
these
are
observations
i
felt
bound
to
make
to
you
do
you
consider
them
really
serious
i
acknowledge
objections
to
them
would
be
much
more
so
is
it
of
no
consequence
to
ascertain
whether
helen
loves
me
or
not
that
can
be
decided
at
once
how
i
will
send
for
her
the
shortest
explanations
are
always
the
best
the
count
became
as
pale
as
he
had
been
red
the
moment
before
in
a
trembling
voice
he
exclaimed
not
now
for
heaven
sake
not
now
but
my
dear
karl
frederic
do
you
believe
i
am
your
friend
good
heavens
yes
well
do
you
suppose
i
would
subject
you
to
an
interview
which
could
only
make
you
unhappy
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
believe
believe
what
i
believe
that
she
loves
you
as
much
as
you
love
her
my
friend
you
will
kill
me
with
joy
well
since
you
are
so
afraid
of
an
interview
with
helen
go
and
do
your
hunting
in
the
taunus
kill
your
wild
boar
and
come
back
again
the
thing
will
be
done
done
how
i
will
undertake
it
no
frederic
i
will
not
go
what
you
will
not
go
only
think
of
your
men
waiting
there
with
their
flutes
they
may
wait
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
helen
appeared
on
the
threshold
helen
exclaimed
karl
you
will
be
careful
you
must
not
be
too
long
with
my
brother
she
said
remaining
at
the
door
he
is
waiting
for
you
observed
frederic
for
me
yes
come
here
but
i
do
understand
in
the
least
never
mind
come
here
karl
offered
his
hand
to
helen
oh
mademoiselle
he
said
do
what
your
brother
asks
i
entreat
you
well
she
said
what
shall
i
do
you
can
lend
your
hand
to
karl
he
will
return
it
karl
seized
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
helen
uttered
a
cry
timid
as
a
child
karl
released
the
hand
you
did
not
hurt
me
said
helen
karl
promptly
repossessed
himself
of
the
released
hand
brother
said
frederic
did
you
not
say
you
had
a
secret
you
wished
to
confide
to
helen
oh
yes
yes
cried
karl
all
right
i
am
not
listening
karl
bent
towards
helen
ear
and
the
sweet
words
i
love
you
fell
from
his
lips
with
a
whisper
as
of
a
moth
wings
which
flitting
by
your
ear
on
a
spring
evening
breathes
the
eternal
secret
of
nature
oh
frederic
frederic
cried
helen
hiding
her
forehead
on
his
couch
i
was
not
mistaken
then
raising
her
head
and
languidly
opening
her
beautiful
eyes
and
i
she
said
i
love
you
chapter
xiv
the
grandmother
for
a
few
moments
frederic
left
the
lovers
to
themselves
and
their
happiness
then
as
both
raised
their
eyes
to
his
as
if
enquiring
what
next
should
be
done
the
little
sister
said
he
must
go
and
tell
all
this
to
her
big
sister
the
big
sister
will
relate
it
to
the
grandmother
and
the
grandmother
who
believes
in
me
will
come
and
talk
it
over
and
we
will
arrange
things
together
and
when
must
i
go
and
tell
all
this
to
the
big
sister
enquired
helen
at
once
if
you
will
i
will
go
now
you
will
wait
for
me
karl
karl
smile
and
gesture
answered
her
helen
glided
out
of
his
embrace
and
vanished
like
a
bird
now
for
our
own
affairs
said
frederic
how
what
affairs
i
have
something
to
tell
you
anything
important
very
serious
anything
about
our
marriage
you
alarm
me
suppose
this
morning
when
you
doubted
the
possibility
of
helen
love
i
had
answered
not
be
afraid
helen
loves
and
will
marry
you
but
there
is
an
obstacle
and
the
marriage
can
not
possibly
take
place
in
less
than
a
year
what
would
you
have
i
should
have
been
in
despair
at
the
delay
but
transported
by
the
news
well
my
friend
i
tell
you
now
what
i
should
have
told
you
this
morning
helen
loves
you
she
did
not
ask
me
to
tell
you
this
she
has
told
it
herself
but
at
this
moment
there
is
an
insurmountable
obstacle
at
least
you
will
explain
what
the
obstacle
is
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
is
yet
a
secret
karl
in
a
week
or
at
most
a
fortnight
prussia
will
declare
war
against
austria
ah
i
feared
it
bismarck
is
germany
evil
genius
well
now
you
will
understand
as
friends
we
can
serve
on
opposite
sides
that
happens
every
day
but
as
we
could
not
you
can
hardly
become
my
at
the
very
moment
of
unsheathing
your
sword
against
me
you
are
quite
sure
of
your
information
most
certainly
i
am
bismarck
now
occupies
such
a
position
in
regard
to
the
chambers
and
has
forced
the
king
into
such
a
position
with
regard
to
the
other
german
princes
that
either
he
must
embroil
germany
from
berlin
to
pest
and
even
to
innspruck
or
he
will
be
tried
for
high
treason
and
end
his
days
in
a
fortress
now
bismarck
is
a
power
a
power
of
darkness
if
you
will
he
will
not
be
tried
for
high
treason
and
he
will
embroil
germany
for
this
reason
prussia
has
nothing
to
gain
by
upsetting
him
whereas
by
upsetting
germany
she
can
annex
two
or
three
little
kingdoms
or
duchies
which
will
round
off
her
borders
very
comfortably
but
the
confederation
will
be
against
him
little
will
he
care
for
that
so
long
as
he
himself
remains
indispensable
and
listen
to
what
i
tell
you
the
more
enemies
prussia
has
the
more
she
will
beat
them
our
army
is
organized
as
no
other
european
army
is
organized
at
the
present
moment
you
say
our
army
then
you
have
become
a
i
thought
you
were
a
i
am
a
silesian
prussian
since
the
days
of
frederic
ii
all
i
have
i
owe
to
king
william
and
i
would
willingly
die
for
him
while
regretting
it
should
be
in
a
bad
cause
what
do
you
advise
in
my
case
you
are
a
styrian
therefore
an
austrian
fight
for
your
emperor
like
a
lion
and
if
by
ill
luck
we
meet
in
a
cavalry
charge
you
turn
your
horse
to
the
right
i
also
turn
mine
we
salute
and
pass
on
do
yourself
get
lulled
that
is
all
and
we
will
sign
the
marriage
contract
the
day
peace
is
declared
unhappily
i
see
no
other
way
out
of
it
unless
by
good
luck
we
could
both
remain
at
frankfort
a
free
and
neutral
town
i
have
no
wish
to
fight
with
germans
it
will
be
an
iniquitous
war
if
it
had
been
turks
french
or
russians
it
would
be
all
right
but
between
children
of
the
same
country
speaking
the
same
language
my
patriotism
ends
there
i
confess
that
last
hope
must
be
given
up
i
myself
brought
orders
to
the
prussian
general
here
to
be
ready
to
leave
austria
will
certainly
withdraw
her
troops
also
frankfort
may
have
a
bavarian
garrison
or
be
left
with
one
of
her
own
but
most
certainly
we
to
the
last
man
shall
have
to
rejoin
the
army
poor
dear
helen
what
are
we
to
say
when
she
comes
back
we
will
say
the
marriage
is
decided
on
that
the
betrothal
will
take
place
but
the
marriage
must
be
delayed
for
a
year
if
in
spite
of
my
prophecy
war
should
not
be
declared
you
can
marry
at
once
if
this
war
does
take
place
it
is
not
a
war
which
will
last
it
will
be
a
tempest
a
hurricane
passing
over
and
destroying
everything
then
it
will
be
peace
if
i
fix
a
date
it
is
because
i
am
sure
not
to
have
to
ask
for
further
delay
helen
is
eighteen
she
will
then
be
nineteen
you
are
now
you
will
then
be
this
delay
is
not
caused
by
circumstances
of
our
making
circumstances
impose
it
on
us
we
must
give
way
to
them
you
will
promise
not
to
let
anything
change
your
opinion
of
me
and
that
from
june
you
count
yourself
my
on
parole
the
honour
is
too
dear
for
me
ever
to
think
of
repudiating
it
from
june
i
am
your
on
parole
madame
von
beling
this
exclamation
was
drawn
from
karl
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
an
elderly
lady
dressed
entirely
in
black
she
had
splendid
hair
white
as
snow
and
must
in
youth
have
been
very
beautiful
her
whole
appearance
betokened
distinction
and
benevolence
how
is
this
my
dear
frederic
said
she
entering
the
room
you
have
been
here
since
five
this
morning
and
i
only
hear
of
your
arrival
from
your
wife
at
two
in
the
afternoon
also
that
you
are
in
pain
dear
grandmamma
answered
frederic
but
do
i
not
also
know
that
you
do
not
awake
before
eleven
and
only
rise
at
noon
true
but
they
tell
me
you
have
a
sprained
arm
i
have
three
excellent
remedies
for
sprains
one
which
is
perfect
came
from
my
old
friend
goethe
one
from
another
old
friend
madame
schröder
and
the
third
from
baron
von
humboldt
you
see
the
origin
of
all
three
is
unimpeachable
turning
to
karl
who
bowing
brought
forward
an
armchair
for
her
she
said
you
herr
von
freyberg
have
evidently
no
sprains
for
you
are
in
hunting
costume
ah
you
do
not
know
how
your
styrian
dress
recalls
a
happy
memory
of
my
youth
the
first
time
i
saw
my
husband
herr
von
beling
it
is
now
something
like
years
ago
for
it
was
in
at
a
carnival
masked
ball
he
wore
a
similar
costume
to
the
one
you
are
now
wearing
he
was
about
your
age
in
the
middle
of
the
ball
i
remember
as
if
it
were
yesterday
we
heard
of
the
landing
of
that
accursed
napoleon
the
dancers
vowed
that
if
he
again
ascended
the
throne
they
would
go
to
fight
him
the
ladies
each
chose
a
cavalier
who
should
be
entitled
to
wear
her
colours
in
the
coming
campaign
i
did
like
the
rest
and
i
chose
herr
von
beling
although
in
my
heart
of
hearts
for
i
have
remained
french
in
heart
i
could
not
be
very
angry
with
the
man
who
had
made
france
so
great
this
fanciful
nomination
of
herr
von
beling
as
a
champion
wearing
my
colours
opened
my
parents
house
to
him
he
could
not
he
said
be
my
knight
without
their
permission
they
gave
their
permission
napoleon
again
became
emperor
herr
von
beling
rejoined
his
regiment
but
he
first
asked
my
hand
from
my
mother
my
mother
consulted
me
i
loved
him
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
marry
when
the
war
was
over
the
campaign
was
not
long
and
when
herr
von
beling
returned
we
were
married
i
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
feeling
a
little
vexed
that
he
had
contributed
the
three
hundred
millionth
part
towards
the
dethronement
of
my
hero
but
i
never
confessed
this
small
infidelity
of
enthusiasm
and
our
life
was
no
less
happy
on
that
account
dear
grandmamma
enquired
frederic
did
herr
von
beling
he
must
have
been
very
handsome
in
styrian
garb
i
have
seen
his
portrait
did
herr
von
beling
kneel
before
you
when
he
asked
the
favour
of
being
your
knight
certainly
and
very
gracefully
he
did
it
too
returned
the
old
lady
did
he
do
it
better
than
my
friend
karl
better
than
your
friend
karl
but
is
your
friend
karl
likely
to
kneel
before
me
by
any
chance
just
look
at
him
madame
von
beling
turned
round
and
saw
indeed
karl
kneeling
on
the
ground
before
her
good
gracious
said
she
laughing
have
i
suddenly
grown
fifty
years
younger
my
dear
grandmother
said
frederic
while
karl
took
possession
of
the
old
lady
hand
no
you
have
still
your
threescore
and
ten
years
which
become
you
so
well
that
i
will
not
let
you
off
a
single
one
of
them
but
here
is
karl
who
also
is
going
to
the
war
and
who
asks
to
be
called
the
knight
of
your
granddaughter
helen
really
and
is
my
little
granddaughter
helen
actually
old
enough
to
have
a
knight
of
her
very
own
she
is
eighteen
grandmother
eighteen
my
age
when
i
married
herr
von
beling
it
is
the
age
when
leaves
forsake
the
tree
and
are
borne
away
by
the
wind
if
helen
hour
has
struck
she
continued
with
a
mournful
smile
she
must
go
like
the
rest
never
never
dear
grandmother
cried
the
young
girl
who
had
entered
unperceived
never
so
far
but
that
i
can
every
day
kiss
the
dear
hand
which
gives
life
to
all
of
us
and
she
knelt
down
beside
karl
and
took
the
other
hand
ah
said
madame
von
beling
nodding
her
head
so
that
is
why
i
was
invited
to
come
upstairs
i
was
to
be
caught
in
a
trap
well
what
am
i
to
do
now
how
defend
myself
to
surrender
at
once
is
stupid
it
is
like
a
scene
from
molière
very
well
grandmamma
do
surrender
or
at
least
not
without
conditions
and
what
are
they
to
be
that
these
young
people
can
be
betrothed
as
soon
as
they
like
but
that
the
marriage
like
your
own
can
only
be
celebrated
when
the
war
is
over
what
war
asked
helen
in
anxiety
we
will
tell
you
about
it
later
meanwhile
if
karl
is
your
knight
he
must
wear
your
colours
what
are
they
i
have
only
one
replied
helen
it
is
green
then
he
is
wearing
them
now
said
frederic
indicating
his
coat
with
green
facings
and
the
hat
with
its
wide
band
of
green
velvet
and
in
honour
of
my
lady
love
said
karl
rising
a
hundred
men
shall
also
wear
them
with
me
and
like
me
everything
was
now
settled
and
the
whole
party
frederic
leading
the
way
madame
von
beling
on
karl
arm
went
downstairs
to
convey
the
good
news
to
the
dear
invalid
that
same
evening
it
was
known
that
the
diet
was
convoked
at
frankfort
for
june
chapter
xv
it
is
time
to
give
some
information
concerning
the
town
in
which
the
chief
events
of
our
history
will
take
place
frankfort
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
important
towns
in
germany
not
merely
on
account
of
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
nor
because
of
its
commercial
standing
but
by
reason
of
the
political
position
which
it
occupies
as
being
the
seat
of
the
imperial
diet
one
continually
hears
phrases
repeated
until
they
become
familiar
without
the
person
precisely
understanding
the
exact
meaning
let
us
in
a
few
words
explain
what
the
functions
of
the
imperial
diet
really
are
it
is
the
duty
of
the
diet
to
watch
over
the
affairs
of
germany
in
general
and
to
smooth
down
disagreements
between
the
confederate
states
the
president
is
always
a
representative
of
austria
the
decisions
of
the
assembly
are
called
the
diet
which
has
existed
since
very
remote
ages
had
at
first
no
fixed
seat
but
was
held
sometimes
at
nuremberg
sometimes
at
ratisbon
or
at
augsbourg
finally
june
the
congress
of
vienna
established
frankfort
as
the
permanent
seat
of
the
diet
of
the
germanic
confederation
thanks
to
the
new
constitution
frankfort
has
a
quarter
vote
at
the
diet
the
other
belonging
to
the
three
free
towns
of
hamburg
bremen
and
lubeck
in
return
for
this
honour
frankfort
was
to
raise
seven
hundred
and
fifty
men
for
the
germanic
confederation
and
fire
a
salute
on
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
leipzig
the
execution
of
this
latter
obligation
was
at
first
a
trifle
difficult
for
the
reason
that
since
frankfort
had
ceased
to
possess
ramparts
and
since
had
owned
no
cannon
but
in
the
first
moments
of
enthusiasm
a
subscription
was
opened
which
allowed
the
purchase
of
two
so
that
since
on
the
proper
day
frankfort
has
duly
paid
the
debt
of
fire
and
smoke
owed
to
the
holy
alliance
as
to
the
ramparts
they
exist
no
longer
instead
of
old
walls
and
muddy
ditches
frankfort
has
seen
the
gradual
formation
of
a
charming
english
garden
a
gracious
and
perfumed
enclosure
which
enables
one
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
town
while
walking
on
the
smoothest
of
paths
and
under
magnificent
trees
so
that
with
its
houses
painted
white
green
and
pink
frankfort
looks
like
a
bouquet
of
camellias
set
in
a
border
of
heather
the
tomb
of
the
mayor
to
whom
this
improvement
is
due
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
delightful
labyrinth
of
walks
much
frequented
by
the
burghers
and
their
families
about
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
the
teuton
name
frankfort
means
a
and
the
town
owes
its
origin
to
an
imperial
castle
built
by
charlemagne
at
a
point
where
the
namur
is
fordable
the
first
historical
notice
of
it
is
the
date
of
the
council
held
there
in
in
which
was
discussed
the
question
of
image
worship
as
to
charlemagne
palace
no
trace
of
it
can
be
found
but
antiquaries
say
that
it
stood
where
now
is
the
church
of
leonard
it
must
have
been
about
that
charlemagne
founded
the
colony
of
sachsenhausen
peopled
by
the
saxons
whom
he
had
conquered
and
baptized
in
louis
le
debonnaire
built
the
sala
on
the
site
of
the
present
saalhof
and
in
frankfort
had
already
a
court
of
justice
and
walls
of
defence
in
louis
the
german
raised
it
to
the
rank
of
capital
of
the
eastern
portion
of
the
french
empire
extended
its
borders
and
built
the
church
of
saviour
close
to
where
the
autumn
fair
was
held
in
accordance
with
the
traders
custom
of
setting
up
their
booths
under
the
walls
of
churches
and
temples
the
custom
of
electing
the
emperor
at
frankfort
was
begun
by
that
great
swabian
house
whose
name
alone
calls
up
a
host
of
terrible
and
melancholy
recollections
in
frederic
ii
granted
letters
of
safe
conduct
to
all
going
to
the
market
of
frankfort
and
the
emperor
louis
of
bavaria
wishing
to
show
gratitude
for
his
election
proved
his
attachment
to
the
town
by
granting
great
advantages
among
others
the
right
of
holding
a
fair
for
fifteen
days
during
lent
which
was
known
as
the
easter
fair
the
emperor
charles
iv
confirmed
the
right
of
the
imperial
election
to
frankfort
by
the
famous
golden
bull
issued
in
this
bull
provided
the
emperor
napoleon
with
an
opportunity
for
displaying
his
excellent
memory
dining
one
day
with
half
a
score
of
sovereign
princes
at
the
meeting
of
erfurth
the
conversation
chanced
to
turn
on
the
golden
bull
which
until
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
had
laid
down
the
rules
for
imperial
elections
the
prince
primate
being
on
his
own
ground
gave
some
details
concerning
the
bull
fixing
the
date
for
i
think
you
are
mistaken
prince
said
napoleon
if
my
memory
is
correct
the
bull
was
published
in
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
charles
iv
your
majesty
is
right
said
the
primate
reconsidering
but
how
is
it
you
remember
the
date
of
a
bull
so
exactly
had
it
been
a
battle
it
would
be
less
wonderful
shall
i
tell
you
the
secret
of
this
wonderful
memory
prince
enquired
napoleon
your
majesty
would
give
us
all
much
pleasure
well
continued
the
emperor
you
must
know
that
when
i
was
a
in
the
artillery
whereupon
there
was
so
decided
a
movement
of
surprise
and
curiosity
among
the
illustrious
guests
that
napoleon
paused
an
instant
but
seeing
that
all
were
waiting
for
him
to
continue
he
resumed
with
a
smile
i
was
saying
that
when
i
had
the
honour
of
being
a
of
artillery
i
was
in
garrison
at
valence
for
three
years
i
did
not
care
for
society
and
lived
very
quietly
by
a
lucky
chance
i
had
rooms
opposite
a
and
obliging
bookseller
whose
name
was
marcus
aurelius
and
who
gave
me
the
run
of
his
library
i
read
and
everything
in
his
shop
two
or
three
times
during
my
stay
in
the
capital
of
the
drôme
and
i
remember
everything
i
then
read
even
to
the
date
of
the
golden
bull
frankfort
continued
to
govern
itself
as
a
free
imperial
town
until
after
having
been
bombarded
by
the
french
in
the
wars
of
the
revolution
it
was
one
fine
day
handed
over
by
napoleon
to
the
prince
primate
charles
of
dalberg
when
it
became
the
capital
of
the
grand
duchy
of
frankfort
the
most
interesting
building
in
frankfort
is
undoubtedly
the
römer
a
huge
building
which
contains
the
hall
of
the
electors
now
used
for
the
sittings
of
the
upper
senate
of
frankfort
and
the
hall
of
the
emperors
in
which
the
latter
were
proclaimed
a
peculiarity
of
this
hall
which
contains
the
portraits
of
all
the
emperors
from
conrad
to
leopold
ii
is
that
the
architect
who
built
it
made
exactly
as
many
niches
as
there
have
been
sovereigns
wearing
the
imperial
crown
so
that
when
francis
ii
was
elected
all
the
niches
were
already
filled
and
there
was
no
space
found
for
the
new
cæsar
there
was
much
discussion
as
to
where
his
portrait
could
be
placed
when
in
the
ancient
german
empire
crumbled
into
dust
at
the
noise
of
the
cannon
of
austerlitz
and
the
courtiers
were
relieved
from
their
difficulty
the
architect
had
exactly
foreseen
the
number
of
emperors
to
come
nostradamus
himself
could
not
have
done
better
after
the
town
hall
the
most
interesting
place
is
the
street
of
the
jews
when
the
writer
of
these
lines
visited
frankfort
for
the
first
time
some
thirty
years
ago
there
were
still
jews
and
austrians
there
real
jews
who
hated
christians
even
as
shylock
hated
them
and
real
christians
who
hated
jews
as
did
torquemada
this
street
consisted
of
two
long
rows
of
tall
houses
black
gloomy
sinister
in
aspect
closely
crowded
looking
as
if
they
clung
to
each
other
in
terror
it
was
saturday
which
no
doubt
added
to
the
gloom
of
the
street
every
door
was
closed
bastard
little
doors
made
to
allow
only
one
person
to
pass
at
once
all
the
iron
shutters
were
also
closed
no
sound
of
voice
or
step
or
movement
was
heard
a
look
of
anguish
and
terror
seemed
spread
over
all
these
houses
occasionally
an
old
woman
with
a
hooked
nose
like
an
owl
glided
past
and
disappeared
in
a
sort
of
cellar
or
basement
in
this
strange
street
all
this
is
more
civilized
and
the
houses
have
a
more
active
and
lively
appearance
the
population
of
frankfort
consists
of
a
historic
bourgeoisie
forming
the
aristocracy
of
the
imperial
town
the
coronation
town
by
right
of
the
golden
bull
the
chief
families
are
those
of
the
old
nobility
those
of
french
extraction
expatriated
by
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
and
who
by
their
intelligence
and
industry
stand
in
the
first
rank
of
society
thirdly
italian
families
in
whom
the
feelings
of
race
have
been
stronger
than
religious
differences
and
who
although
catholics
by
profession
have
mingled
with
the
french
protestants
finally
the
jewish
bankers
who
naturally
group
themselves
around
the
house
of
rothschild
as
being
incontestably
members
of
the
same
clan
all
are
devoted
to
austria
because
to
austria
the
town
owes
its
peculiar
position
the
source
of
its
wealth
and
independence
and
all
these
classes
though
divided
by
race
language
and
religion
are
united
by
their
common
affection
for
the
house
of
hapsburg
a
love
which
perhaps
hardly
attains
to
devotion
but
which
in
words
at
least
amounts
to
fanaticism
one
must
not
omit
the
suburb
of
sachsenhausen
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
the
colony
founded
by
charlemagne
its
inhabitants
living
closely
together
and
only
marrying
among
themselves
have
retained
some
of
the
roughness
of
the
old
saxon
character
this
roughness
contrasted
with
the
growing
politeness
among
other
nations
now
seems
to
be
absolute
rudeness
but
rudeness
which
is
not
intentional
they
are
said
to
be
ready
in
the
use
of
the
somewhat
harsh
but
occasionally
witty
retorts
wherewith
the
weak
sometimes
retaliate
upon
the
strong
we
can
give
two
specimens
of
the
rough
speech
of
the
people
of
sachsenhausen
as
is
usual
in
the
month
of
may
owing
to
the
melting
of
the
snow
the
main
was
in
flood
the
great
elector
himself
came
to
judge
of
the
rise
of
the
water
and
the
damage
it
would
probably
cause
meeting
a
man
from
sachsenhausen
well
he
asked
is
the
main
still
rising
well
idiot
that
you
are
replied
the
individual
addressed
ca
you
see
that
for
yourself
and
the
old
saxon
went
on
shrugging
his
shoulders
one
of
his
comrades
ran
after
him
do
you
know
to
whom
it
was
you
spoke
he
asked
no
i
do
well
it
was
the
elector
of
hesse
himself
thunder
and
lightning
exclaimed
the
old
man
how
glad
i
am
i
answered
him
civilly
at
the
play
one
of
these
honest
people
leaned
against
the
man
sitting
in
front
of
him
the
latter
moved
away
am
i
annoying
you
demanded
the
aggressor
because
if
it
were
you
who
annoyed
me
i
should
give
you
a
punch
you
would
remember
the
rest
of
your
life
since
frankfort
has
been
garrisoned
by
two
detachments
of
fifteen
hundred
to
two
thousand
each
one
austrian
the
other
prussian
the
former
were
much
beloved
the
latter
equally
or
even
more
hated
a
prussian
officer
was
taking
some
friends
to
see
the
curiosities
of
frankfort
they
arrived
at
the
dôme
there
among
other
votive
offerings
representations
of
hearts
hands
or
feet
the
sacristan
exhibited
a
mouse
made
of
silver
what
was
that
for
some
one
asked
through
the
divine
wrath
answered
the
sacristan
a
whole
quarter
of
frankfort
once
found
itself
eaten
up
by
swarms
of
mice
in
vain
they
fetched
all
the
cats
of
the
other
quarters
all
the
terriers
bulldogs
every
sort
of
animal
that
can
kill
a
mouse
the
plague
increased
at
last
a
devout
lady
thought
of
having
a
silver
mouse
made
and
dedicated
to
the
virgin
as
a
votive
gift
at
the
end
of
a
week
not
a
mouse
was
to
be
seen
and
as
the
listeners
were
somewhat
astonished
when
they
heard
this
legend
what
fools
these
frankforters
are
said
the
prussian
to
tell
tales
of
that
kind
and
believe
them
we
tell
them
said
the
sacristan
but
we
do
not
believe
them
if
we
did
we
should
have
made
a
silver
prussian
and
offered
him
to
the
virgin
long
ago
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
our
friend
lenhart
benedict
coachman
was
a
citizen
of
the
sachsenhausen
colony
chapter
xvi
the
departure
since
the
troubles
the
diet
had
always
assembled
at
frankfort
on
june
this
year
that
date
was
the
day
after
the
attempted
assassination
of
bismarck
on
which
benedict
drank
to
the
health
of
france
the
diet
knowing
of
the
mobilization
of
the
landwehr
and
the
dissolution
of
the
chamber
decreed
that
if
frankfort
were
not
to
be
compromised
in
its
position
as
a
free
and
imperial
town
in
the
various
events
which
would
necessarily
follow
a
war
between
prussia
and
austria
the
prussian
and
austrian
garrisons
must
be
withdrawn
and
replaced
by
a
bavarian
garrison
it
was
agreed
that
bavaria
should
appoint
the
and
frankfort
the
governor
of
the
town
the
bavarian
colonel
lessel
who
had
been
for
many
years
member
of
the
federated
military
commission
for
bavaria
was
appointed
and
the
of
the
frankfort
battalion
became
governor
of
the
town
the
departure
of
the
prussian
and
austrian
troops
was
fixed
for
june
and
it
was
decided
that
the
prussians
should
leave
by
two
special
trains
on
the
line
at
six
and
eight
in
the
morning
for
wetzlar
and
the
austrians
at
three
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
this
arrangement
was
known
in
frankfort
on
the
and
as
may
be
understood
filled
the
chandroz
house
with
despair
emma
would
be
separated
from
her
husband
and
helen
from
her
lover
we
have
said
that
the
prussians
were
to
leave
first
at
five
in
the
morning
frederic
said
farewell
to
his
wife
his
child
his
dear
sister
helen
and
the
grandmother
it
was
too
early
for
karl
von
freyberg
to
be
in
the
house
at
that
hour
but
he
waited
for
his
friend
on
the
zeil
he
and
helen
had
agreed
the
evening
before
that
after
having
seen
frederic
off
karl
should
come
back
and
wait
for
her
in
the
little
catholic
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
the
harmony
between
the
two
young
people
was
perfect
helen
and
karl
though
born
in
two
different
countries
hundreds
of
leagues
apart
were
both
catholics
doubtless
they
had
selected
this
early
hour
because
they
knew
the
little
liking
the
people
of
frankfort
had
for
the
prussians
no
manifestation
of
regret
was
shown
on
the
departure
of
the
latter
perhaps
they
were
watched
through
the
closed
shutters
but
not
a
window
or
blind
opened
for
a
flower
to
fall
which
might
say
au
revoir
no
waving
handkerchief
said
farewell
one
would
have
sworn
it
was
a
troop
of
the
enemy
leaving
a
town
and
the
town
itself
seemed
only
to
wait
for
their
departure
in
order
to
wake
up
and
rejoice
only
the
officers
of
the
city
battalion
came
to
the
station
courteously
to
see
them
off
wishing
nothing
better
than
soon
to
fight
them
with
deadly
hate
frederic
left
by
the
second
train
at
eight
in
the
morning
consequently
karl
was
late
and
it
was
helen
who
waited
for
him
she
was
standing
by
the
holy
water
stoup
leaning
against
a
white
pillar
she
smiled
sadly
when
she
saw
karl
gently
dipped
two
fingers
in
the
holy
water
and
held
them
towards
him
karl
took
her
whole
hand
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
it
never
had
the
beautiful
girl
looked
so
lovely
as
at
this
moment
when
karl
was
going
to
be
parted
from
her
she
had
scarcely
slept
all
night
all
the
rest
of
the
time
she
had
wept
and
prayed
she
was
dressed
in
white
like
a
bride
with
a
wreath
of
little
white
roses
on
her
head
they
went
together
karl
with
helen
hand
in
his
to
kneel
in
one
of
the
side
chapels
where
helen
was
accustomed
to
pray
almost
all
the
ornaments
in
the
chapel
from
the
altar
cloth
to
the
virgin
dress
were
the
work
of
her
hand
alone
and
the
madonna
gold
and
pearl
crown
had
been
her
gift
they
prayed
together
then
karl
said
we
are
going
to
part
helen
what
vows
shall
i
make
you
and
in
what
words
shall
they
be
made
karl
replied
helen
tell
me
again
before
the
beloved
madonna
who
has
watched
over
me
in
childhood
and
youth
tell
me
again
that
you
will
love
me
always
and
that
you
will
have
no
other
wife
but
me
karl
quickly
extended
his
hand
ah
yes
he
said
and
willingly
for
i
have
always
loved
you
i
love
you
now
and
i
shall
love
you
always
yes
you
shall
be
my
wife
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
here
and
above
thank
you
said
helen
i
have
given
you
my
heart
and
with
my
heart
my
life
you
are
the
tree
and
i
am
the
creeper
you
are
the
trunk
and
i
am
the
ivy
which
covers
you
with
its
verdure
at
the
moment
when
i
first
saw
you
i
said
with
juliet
will
belong
to
you
or
to
the
tomb
helen
cried
the
young
man
why
link
that
dismal
word
with
such
a
sweet
promise
but
she
not
listening
continued
her
thought
i
ask
no
other
vow
than
that
which
you
have
sworn
karl
it
is
the
repetition
of
mine
keep
yours
as
it
is
but
when
i
have
said
that
i
will
love
you
always
that
i
will
never
love
any
one
but
you
and
that
i
will
never
be
another
let
me
add
and
if
you
die
i
will
die
with
you
helen
my
love
what
are
you
saying
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
say
my
karl
that
since
my
heart
has
left
my
bosom
to
dwell
in
yours
you
have
become
all
that
i
think
of
all
i
live
for
and
that
if
anything
happened
to
you
i
should
not
need
to
kill
myself
i
should
only
have
to
let
myself
die
i
know
nothing
of
these
royal
quarrels
which
seem
to
me
wicked
because
they
cost
the
blood
of
men
and
tears
of
women
i
only
know
that
it
matters
not
to
me
whether
francis
joseph
or
william
i
is
victorious
i
live
if
you
live
i
die
if
you
die
helen
do
you
wish
to
drive
me
mad
that
you
say
these
terrible
things
no
i
only
wish
you
to
know
when
you
are
absent
what
is
happening
to
me
and
if
when
far
from
me
you
are
mortally
wounded
instead
of
saying
shall
never
see
her
again
you
must
simply
say
am
going
to
meet
her
and
i
say
this
as
truly
and
sincerely
as
i
lay
this
wreath
at
the
feet
of
my
beloved
virgin
and
she
took
her
wreath
of
white
roses
and
laid
it
at
the
virgin
feet
and
now
she
continued
my
vow
is
made
i
have
said
what
i
had
to
say
to
stay
here
now
to
speak
longer
of
love
would
be
sacrilege
come
karl
you
go
this
afternoon
at
two
but
my
sister
my
grandmother
and
frederic
will
permit
you
to
remain
with
me
till
then
they
rose
again
offered
each
other
the
holy
water
and
left
the
church
the
young
girl
took
karl
arm
for
from
that
moment
she
considered
herself
as
his
wife
but
with
the
same
feeling
of
respect
which
made
him
take
off
his
kolbach
when
he
entered
the
church
he
only
allowed
her
hand
to
lie
lightly
on
his
arm
all
the
way
from
nôtre
dame
de
la
croix
until
they
reached
the
house
the
day
was
passed
in
intimate
conversation
on
the
day
when
he
had
asked
helen
which
were
her
favourite
colours
and
she
had
answered
green
he
had
made
a
resolution
which
he
now
explained
to
her
this
was
what
he
wished
to
do
he
would
ask
his
colonel
for
eight
days
leave
surely
fighting
would
not
begin
for
eight
days
it
would
take
him
scarcely
twenty
hours
to
reach
his
mountains
where
he
was
king
there
besides
the
rangers
always
in
his
service
he
would
select
chosen
men
from
the
best
styrian
hunters
they
should
wear
the
uniform
he
himself
wore
when
hunting
he
would
arm
them
with
the
best
rifles
he
could
find
then
he
would
give
in
his
resignation
as
captain
in
the
lichtenstein
light
infantry
and
ask
the
emperor
to
appoint
him
captain
of
his
free
company
an
excellent
shot
himself
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
men
renowned
for
their
smartness
he
could
hope
for
results
which
when
buried
in
a
regiment
under
the
orders
of
a
colonel
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
his
attaining
there
would
also
be
another
advantage
in
this
arrangement
as
the
head
of
a
free
regiment
karl
would
have
liberty
of
movement
in
such
a
case
he
would
not
be
attached
to
any
special
regiment
he
would
be
able
to
fight
on
his
own
account
doing
all
possible
harm
to
the
enemy
but
only
answerable
to
the
emperor
he
would
thus
be
able
to
remain
near
frankfort
the
only
town
which
now
existed
for
him
in
the
world
since
in
this
town
lived
helen
the
heart
exists
not
where
it
beats
but
where
it
loves
according
to
the
prussian
plan
of
campaign
which
was
to
envelop
germany
as
in
a
hurling
king
princes
and
peoples
one
on
the
top
of
another
while
marching
from
west
to
east
there
would
certainly
be
fighting
in
hesse
in
the
duchy
of
baden
and
in
bavaria
all
near
frankfort
it
was
there
that
karl
would
fight
and
with
good
spies
he
could
always
ascertain
where
his
was
likely
to
be
and
so
avoid
the
risk
of
meeting
him
in
the
midst
of
all
these
plans
for
which
unfortunately
they
could
not
enlist
the
aid
of
fortune
time
was
flying
the
clock
struck
two
at
two
the
austrian
officers
and
soldiers
were
to
assemble
in
the
courtyard
of
the
carmelite
barracks
karl
kissed
the
baroness
and
the
child
lying
in
its
cradle
beside
her
then
he
went
with
helen
to
kneel
before
her
grandmother
and
ask
her
blessing
the
dear
old
lady
wept
to
see
them
so
sad
she
laid
her
hands
upon
their
heads
wishing
to
bless
them
but
her
voice
broke
they
both
rose
and
stood
mute
before
her
silent
tears
flowed
down
their
cheeks
she
pitied
them
helen
she
said
i
kissed
your
grandfather
when
i
bade
him
farewell
and
i
see
no
reason
against
your
granting
poor
karl
the
same
favour
the
young
people
threw
themselves
into
each
other
arms
and
their
grandmother
under
pretext
of
wiping
away
a
tear
turned
away
leaving
them
free
for
their
last
kiss
helen
had
long
sought
for
some
means
of
seeing
karl
again
after
leaving
the
house
where
he
had
been
permitted
to
take
his
last
farewell
she
had
not
succeeded
when
suddenly
she
remembered
that
the
burgomaster
fellner
her
sister
godfather
had
windows
overlooking
the
station
she
asked
her
good
grandmother
to
come
with
her
to
ask
her
old
friend
for
a
place
in
his
window
women
who
remain
beautiful
when
growing
old
generally
keep
a
young
heart
the
kind
grandmother
consented
so
it
was
only
a
goodbye
of
the
lips
which
the
young
people
had
already
said
there
remained
a
last
adieu
of
the
eyes
and
heart
hans
was
ordered
to
bring
round
the
carriage
without
delay
while
karl
went
to
the
carmelite
barracks
helen
would
have
time
on
her
part
to
go
to
the
burgomaster
fellner
helen
made
a
sign
to
hans
to
hurry
but
he
replied
with
another
that
it
was
unnecessary
she
then
glanced
again
at
karl
he
had
never
seemed
so
handsome
as
at
this
moment
when
about
to
leave
her
she
came
down
leaning
on
his
arm
in
order
not
to
leave
him
until
they
reached
the
threshold
the
last
moment
possible
once
there
a
last
kiss
sealed
their
separation
and
pledged
their
vows
a
hussar
waited
for
his
captain
at
the
door
holding
his
horse
karl
saluted
helen
once
again
then
galloped
off
sparks
flying
from
under
his
horse
hoofs
he
was
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
the
instant
he
had
gone
hans
came
with
the
carriage
in
another
moment
they
were
at
herr
fellner
frankfort
was
now
a
very
different
town
to
what
it
had
been
in
the
morning
we
have
told
of
the
sombre
and
sad
departure
of
the
prussians
who
were
detested
there
the
citizens
now
wished
to
give
a
friendly
farewell
to
the
austrians
who
were
adored
therefore
although
the
departure
was
a
separation
and
each
separation
may
hide
the
invisible
and
hide
also
a
coming
grief
this
departure
was
to
be
made
a
farewell
fête
the
windows
were
all
draped
with
austrian
flags
and
at
each
window
where
floated
a
flag
might
be
seen
the
prettiest
women
of
frankfort
with
bouquets
in
their
hands
the
streets
which
led
to
the
station
were
crammed
with
people
until
one
asked
how
the
regiment
could
pass
in
the
street
leading
to
the
station
the
frankfort
regiment
stood
at
attention
each
soldier
with
the
stock
of
his
rifle
between
his
feet
and
a
bouquet
in
the
muzzle
of
it
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
helen
was
obliged
to
get
out
of
the
carriage
at
last
she
reached
the
house
of
herr
fellner
who
although
not
formally
advised
of
the
engagement
of
his
young
friend
had
noticed
that
captain
freyberg
was
not
indifferent
to
her
his
two
daughters
and
his
wife
received
helen
and
her
grandmother
at
the
door
of
their
apartments
they
formed
a
charming
family
living
with
herr
sister
and
who
had
no
children
in
the
days
of
peace
and
happiness
at
frankfort
herr
fellner
and
his
received
their
friends
twice
every
week
any
strangers
of
distinction
passing
through
were
sure
to
be
made
welcome
by
herr
fellner
it
was
at
his
house
that
benedict
turpin
had
met
the
baroness
frederic
von
bülow
a
meeting
which
as
we
have
seen
he
did
not
forget
at
three
precisely
they
heard
in
the
midst
of
cries
hurrahs
and
acclamations
the
trumpets
of
the
regiment
which
was
coming
to
the
station
by
the
zeil
and
the
street
of
all
saints
playing
march
it
might
have
been
said
that
the
whole
population
of
frankfort
was
following
the
splendid
regiment
men
waved
flags
from
the
windows
above
them
women
threw
them
their
bouquets
and
then
waved
their
handkerchiefs
with
those
cries
of
enthusiasm
which
women
only
know
how
to
utter
on
such
occasions
helen
had
recognized
karl
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
and
karl
had
answered
her
waving
handkerchief
by
saluting
with
his
sabre
when
he
passed
under
the
window
she
threw
him
a
scabious
bound
up
with
the
scabious
meant
sorrow
and
desolation
and
the
do
not
forget
me
karl
caught
the
flowers
in
his
kolbach
and
fastened
them
on
his
breast
still
turning
to
look
back
his
eyes
never
left
helen
until
the
moment
when
he
entered
the
station
at
length
he
disappeared
helen
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
herr
fellner
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
drew
her
back
within
the
room
seeing
the
tears
that
flowed
from
her
eyes
and
divining
their
cause
with
the
help
of
god
dear
child
he
said
he
will
return
helen
escaped
from
his
arms
and
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
endeavouring
to
hide
her
tears
in
the
cushions
chapter
xvii
austrians
and
prussians
desbarolles
says
in
his
book
on
germany
it
is
impossible
to
talk
for
three
minutes
with
an
austrian
without
wishing
to
shake
hands
with
him
it
is
impossible
to
talk
for
three
minutes
with
a
prussian
without
longing
to
quarrel
with
him
does
this
difference
in
the
two
organizations
spring
from
temperament
education
or
the
degree
of
latitude
we
can
not
say
but
it
is
a
fact
that
along
the
whole
way
from
ostrow
to
oderburg
we
know
when
we
have
left
austria
and
entered
prussia
by
the
way
in
which
the
porters
bang
the
carriage
doors
this
double
impression
is
particularly
evident
at
frankfort
a
town
of
gentle
manners
cultivated
habits
and
amateur
bankers
the
country
of
goethe
has
appreciated
this
difference
between
the
extreme
civilization
of
vienna
and
the
rough
protestant
shell
of
berlin
we
have
seen
the
different
demonstrations
of
feeling
at
the
departure
of
the
two
garrisons
the
people
of
frankfort
not
having
the
least
doubt
of
the
result
of
the
war
and
believing
after
the
conclusions
of
the
diet
in
the
superiority
of
the
austrian
arms
which
would
be
aided
by
all
the
little
states
of
the
confederation
they
had
not
cared
to
put
the
least
restraint
on
the
manifestation
of
their
feelings
they
allowed
the
prussians
to
depart
like
vanquished
enemies
whom
they
would
never
see
again
and
they
had
on
the
contrary
fêted
the
austrians
like
victorious
brothers
for
whom
if
they
had
had
the
time
they
would
have
made
triumphal
arches
the
good
burgomaster
where
we
have
introduced
our
readers
was
at
noon
on
june
an
exact
and
complete
specimen
of
all
the
other
of
the
town
whatever
the
origin
country
or
religion
of
the
inhabitants
might
chance
to
be
thus
while
helen
with
whose
grief
all
sympathized
wept
keeping
her
face
buried
in
the
cushions
and
her
good
grandmother
left
the
window
to
sit
beside
her
and
hide
her
somewhat
from
view
councillor
fischer
editor
of
the
post
zeitung
was
writing
on
a
corner
of
the
table
an
article
in
which
he
compared
with
undisguised
antipathy
and
sympathy
the
departure
of
the
prussians
to
a
nocturnal
flight
and
that
of
the
austrians
to
a
triumphal
in
front
of
the
fireplace
the
senator
von
bernus
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
frankfort
by
ability
education
and
birth
was
talking
with
his
colleague
doctor
speltz
chief
of
police
who
owing
to
the
position
which
he
held
was
always
well
informed
a
slight
difference
rather
than
a
discussion
had
arisen
between
them
herr
doctor
speltz
did
not
completely
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
town
people
as
to
the
certain
victory
of
the
austrians
his
private
information
as
chief
of
police
was
of
the
kind
which
may
be
relied
on
and
which
is
obtained
not
to
help
the
opinions
of
others
but
to
form
one
own
and
it
represented
the
prussian
troops
as
full
of
enthusiasm
admirably
armed
and
burning
with
desire
for
battle
their
two
generals
frederick
charles
of
prussia
and
the
crown
prince
were
both
able
to
command
and
to
execute
and
their
rapidity
and
courage
no
one
could
doubt
but
observed
herr
von
bernus
austria
has
an
excellent
army
which
is
animated
with
an
equal
spirit
it
was
beaten
at
palestro
at
magenta
and
at
solferino
it
is
true
but
by
the
french
who
also
beat
the
prussians
at
jena
my
dear
von
bernus
replied
speltz
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
prussians
of
jena
to
the
prussians
of
the
miserable
state
into
which
the
emperor
napoleon
reduced
them
by
only
allowing
them
to
put
forty
thousand
men
under
arms
for
six
years
was
the
providential
cause
of
their
strength
for
with
this
reduced
army
the
officers
and
administrators
could
superintend
the
smallest
details
and
bring
them
as
near
as
possible
to
perfection
from
this
has
grown
the
landwehr
well
said
von
bernus
if
the
prussians
have
the
landwehr
the
austrians
have
the
landsturm
all
the
austrian
population
will
rise
in
arms
yes
if
the
first
battles
are
unsuccessful
yes
if
there
is
a
chance
that
by
rising
they
can
repel
the
prussians
but
of
the
prussian
army
are
armed
with
needle
guns
which
fire
eight
or
ten
shots
a
minute
the
time
is
past
when
as
said
marshal
saxe
the
rifle
is
only
the
handle
of
the
bayonet
and
of
whom
did
he
say
that
was
it
not
the
french
a
fiery
and
warlike
nation
not
methodical
and
military
like
the
austrians
you
know
mein
gott
victory
is
an
entirely
moral
question
to
inspire
the
enemy
with
an
unaccountable
fear
is
the
secret
generally
when
two
regiments
meet
one
of
them
runs
without
having
ever
come
to
grips
with
the
enemy
if
the
new
guns
with
which
the
prussians
are
armed
do
their
work
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
the
terror
in
austria
will
be
so
great
that
the
landsturm
from
königsgrätz
to
trieste
from
salzburg
to
pest
will
not
raise
a
man
psst
my
dear
friend
you
have
named
the
real
stumbling
block
if
the
hungarians
were
with
us
my
hope
would
be
a
conviction
the
hungarians
are
the
nerve
of
the
austrian
army
and
one
can
say
of
them
what
the
ancient
romans
said
of
the
marsi
are
we
to
do
either
against
the
marsi
or
without
the
marsi
but
the
hungarians
will
not
fight
until
they
have
their
separate
government
their
constitution
and
their
three
ministers
and
they
are
right
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
hungary
has
been
promised
that
constitution
it
has
been
given
and
withdrawn
again
and
now
hungary
is
angry
but
the
emperor
has
only
one
word
to
say
one
signature
to
write
and
the
whole
nation
would
rise
for
him
then
the
szozat
would
be
heard
and
in
three
days
they
would
have
a
hundred
thousand
men
under
arms
what
is
the
szozat
asked
a
big
man
who
kept
a
whole
window
to
himself
and
whose
expansive
face
testified
to
great
commercial
prosperity
he
was
indeed
the
first
wine
merchant
of
frankfort
hermann
mumm
the
szozat
said
fischer
still
writing
his
article
is
the
hungarian
marseillaise
by
the
poet
vœrœsmarti
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
there
fellner
he
added
lifting
his
glasses
to
his
forehead
and
looking
at
the
burgomaster
who
was
playing
with
his
two
youngest
children
i
am
doing
something
much
more
important
than
your
article
councillor
i
am
making
a
village
of
which
master
edward
is
to
be
the
baron
with
some
houses
i
got
in
a
box
from
nuremburg
what
does
baron
mean
asked
the
child
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
be
a
baron
is
much
and
it
is
nothing
it
is
much
if
you
are
called
it
is
nothing
if
you
are
called
and
he
went
back
seriously
to
his
village
it
is
said
went
on
von
bernus
to
doctor
speltz
taking
up
the
conversation
where
they
had
left
it
before
hermann
mumm
interruption
that
the
emperor
of
austria
has
named
general
benedek
as
general
in
chief
with
all
powers
the
nomination
was
discussed
in
the
council
and
signed
yesterday
do
you
know
him
yes
it
seems
to
me
a
good
choice
may
god
grant
it
benedek
is
a
man
he
has
won
every
step
sword
in
hand
the
army
will
love
him
better
than
it
would
love
an
archduke
made
by
right
of
birth
you
will
laugh
at
me
von
bernus
and
will
say
i
am
a
bad
republican
very
well
i
would
rather
have
an
archduke
than
this
man
as
you
call
him
yes
if
all
our
officers
were
men
it
would
be
admirable
because
if
none
knew
how
to
command
they
would
at
least
know
how
to
obey
as
it
is
our
officers
are
nobles
who
are
officers
by
position
or
by
favour
they
will
not
obey
or
will
only
obey
such
a
commander
unwillingly
further
you
know
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
a
fatalist
and
to
believe
in
the
influence
of
the
stars
general
benedek
is
a
saturnian
may
austria
escape
his
fatal
influence
he
may
have
patience
in
a
first
loss
resolution
against
a
second
perhaps
but
in
a
third
he
will
lose
his
head
and
be
good
for
nothing
also
do
you
not
see
that
there
can
not
be
two
equally
great
powers
in
germany
germany
with
prussia
in
the
north
and
austria
in
the
south
has
two
heads
like
the
imperial
eagle
now
he
who
has
two
heads
has
not
even
one
last
winter
i
was
at
vienna
on
new
year
day
always
on
january
a
new
standard
is
raised
on
the
fortress
the
standard
for
was
displayed
at
six
in
the
morning
a
moment
afterwards
a
furious
storm
such
as
i
have
seldom
seen
came
from
the
north
the
standard
was
torn
and
the
rent
cut
off
the
two
heads
of
the
eagle
austria
will
lose
her
supremacy
both
in
italy
and
germany
a
profound
gloom
as
of
painful
foreboding
seemed
to
have
spread
over
the
company
the
only
person
unaffected
was
baron
edward
who
while
anxiously
considering
as
to
in
which
corner
of
his
village
he
should
put
the
belfry
had
fallen
fast
asleep
herr
fellner
rang
three
times
and
a
beautiful
peasant
from
baden
answering
the
signal
came
in
and
took
the
child
she
was
carrying
him
away
asleep
in
her
arms
when
herr
fellner
wishing
to
change
the
subject
motioned
to
the
company
listen
he
said
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
nurse
shoulder
linda
he
said
sing
us
that
song
with
which
the
baden
mothers
sing
their
children
to
sleep
then
turning
to
the
others
he
said
gentlemen
listen
to
this
song
which
is
still
sung
low
in
the
duchy
of
baden
perhaps
in
a
few
days
the
time
may
have
come
to
sing
it
aloud
linda
learnt
it
from
her
mother
who
sang
it
over
her
brother
cradle
their
father
was
shot
by
the
prussians
in
now
linda

minutes
when

to
the

for
me
here
i
will
come
back
in
a
quarter
of
an

required
no
guide
queen
mary
was
engaged
upon
a
piece
of
wool
work
with
the
young
princesses
seeing
her
husband
she
went
to
him
and
offered
him
her
forehead
to
kiss
the
princesses
took
possession
of
their
father
hands
see
said
the
king
this
is
what
our
cousin
the
king
of
prussia
does
us
the
honour
to
communicate
through
his
first
minister
the
queen
took
the
paper
and
began
to
read
stay
said
the
king
i
want
to
call
prince
ernest
one
of
the
princesses
hurried
to
the
door
prince
ernest
she
cried
to
the
usher
five
minutes
after

came
in
embraced
his
father
and
sisters
and
kissed
his
mother
hand
listen
to
what
your
mother
is
going
to
read
said
the
usher
to
him
the
minister
bismarck
in
the
name
of
his
master
offered
to
hanover
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
on
the
condition
that
hanover
should
support
prussia
to
the
utmost
of
its
power
with
men
and
soldiers
and
should
give
the
command
of
its
army
to
king
william
the
dispatch
added
that
if
this
pacific
proposal
were
not
immediately
accepted
the
king
of
prussia
would
consider
himself
as
in
a
state
of
war
with
hanover
well
asked
the
king
of
his
wife
no
doubt
she
replied
the
king
has
already
decided
in
his
wisdom
what
is
best
to
do
but
if
he
has
not
finally
decided
and
such
a
feature
as
the
opinion
of
a
woman
is
considered
to
be
as
a
weight
in
the
balance
i
would
say
to
you
refuse
sire
oh
yes
yes
sire
cried
the
young
prince
refuse
i
thought
it
right
to
consult
you
both
replied
the
king
partly
because
of
your
upright
and
loyal
natures
partly
because
your
interests
are
one
with
mine
refuse
father
the
prediction
must
be
fulfilled
to
the
end
what
prediction
asked
the
king
you
forget
sire
that
the
first
word
which
benedict
said
to
you
was
this
will
be
betrayed
by
your
near
relation
you
are
betrayed
by
your
german
cousin
why
should
he
be
wrong
about
the
rest
since
he
was
right
at
the
beginning
you
know
that
he
has
predicted
our
downfall
yes
but
after
a
great
victory
we
are
little
kings
it
is
true
but
we
are
on
the
english
side
great
princes
let
us
act
greatly
that
is
your
opinion
ernest
that
is
my
prayer
sire
said
the
young
prince
bowing
the
king
turned
to
his
wife
and
interrogated
her
by
a
movement
of
his
head
go
my
dear
said
she
and
follow
your
own
thought
which
is
ours
also
but
said
the
king
if
we
are
obliged
to
leave
hanover
what
will
happen
to
you
and
the
two
princesses
we
will
stay
where
we
are
sire
in
our
castle
of
herrenhausen
after
all
the
king
of
prussia
is
my
cousin
and
if
our
crown
is
in
danger
through
him
our
lives
are
not
summon
your
council
sire
and
take
with
you
the
two
voices
which
say
to
you
only
no
treason
against
others
but
above
all
no
treason
against
our
honour
the
king
called
a
council
of
his
ministers
who
unanimously
voted
for
refusal
at
midnight
count
platen
replied
verbally
to
the
prince
of
issemburg
who
had
brought
the
proposal
his
majesty
the
king
of
hanover
declines
the
proposals
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
prussia
as
he
is
constrained
to
do
by
the
laws
of
the
confederation
this
reply
was
instantly
telegraphed
to
berlin
immediately
upon
the
receipt
of
the
reply
another
telegram
from
berlin
ordered
the
troops
concentrated
at
minden
to
enter
hanover
a
later
the
prussian
troops
set
foot
over
the
borders
of
hanover
a
had
sufficed
for
prussia
to
receive
the
reply
and
to
order
the
opening
of
the
campaign
already
the
prussian
troops
from
holstein
who
had
obtained
permission
from
his
majesty
the
king
of
hanover
to
cross
his
territory
in
order
to
get
to
minden
had
stationed
themselves
at
marbourg
and
were
thus
in
occupation
within
the
kingdom
as
enemies
even
before
the
king
decision
moreover
king
george
had
only
held
back
his
answer
until
the
evening
in
order
to
secure
time
for
taking
measures
himself
orders
had
been
given
to
the
different
regiments
of
the
hanoverian
army
to
mobilize
and
assemble
at
göttingen
the
intention
of
the
king
was
to
manœuvre
so
as
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
the
bavarian
army
towards
eleven
at
night
prince
ernest
had
asked
permission
of
queen
mary
to
take
leave
of
her
and
at
the
same
time
to
present
to
her
his
friend
benedict
the
real
object
of
the
young
prince
was
to
get
his
mother
to
entrust
her
hand
to
the
palmist
and
to
be
reassured
by
him
as
to
the
dangers
which
might
encompass
the
queen
the
queen
received
her
son
with
a
kiss
and
the
frenchman
with
a
smile
prince
ernest
explained
his
wish
to
her
she
readily
granted
his
request
and
held
out
her
hand
benedict
knelt
on
one
knee
and
respectfully
put
his
lips
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
sir
she
said
in
the
circumstances
in
which
we
are
placed
it
is
not
my
but
my
that
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
if
you
see
misfortunes
before
you
madam
i
may
be
permitted
to
seek
in
yourself
the
powers
which
providence
has
given
you
to
resist
them
let
us
hope
that
the
resistance
will
be
stronger
than
the
strife
a
woman
hand
is
feeble
sir
when
it
has
to
struggle
against
that
of
destiny
the
hand
of
destiny
is
brute
force
madam
your
hand
is
intelligent
force
look
here
is
a
very
long
first
joint
to
the
thumb
what
does
that
mean
asked
the
queen
will
power
majesty
your
resolution
once
taken
reason
alone
can
conquer
you
and
make
you
change
danger
accident
persecution
never
the
queen
smiled
and
nodded
approvingly
also
you
can
bear
to
hear
the
truth
madam
yes
a
great
misfortune
menaces
you
the
queen
started
benedict
went
on
quickly
but
calm
yourself
it
is
neither
the
death
of
the
king
nor
of
the
prince
the
line
of
life
is
magnificently
marked
on
their
hands
no
the
danger
is
entirely
political
look
at
the
line
of
fate
it
is
broken
here
above
the
line
of
mars
which
shows
from
what
direction
the
storm
will
come
then
this
line
of
fate
which
might
dominate
again
if
it
stopped
at
the
circle
of
the
middle
finger
that
is
at
the
circle

it

answered
me
before
you
madam
the
mount

is
smooth
and
without
lines
the
mount

it

any
strong
feeling
shown
in
the
hand
worthily
developed
may
replace
the
line
of
saturn
and
create
a
new
good
fortune
but
there
will
be
a
long
struggle
first
that
struggle
presents
strange
signs
i
see
in
your
hand

opposed
to

asked
the

toyed
with
a
string

fastened
by
a
clasp

evidently
belonged

of

me
the

this
turquoise
for

you
a

be
worthless
no
it

i
offer
you
you

that
we
people
of

north
have
a
superstition
that
turquoises
bring

as
a
remembrance
of
me
benedict
bowed
received
the
turquoise

on
the
little

of
his
left
hand
while
he
did
this
the

called
prince

to
her
and
took
up
a
satchel
of
perfumed
leather
my
son
said
she
we
know
the
place
which
the
exile
first
step
leaves
but
not
that
at
which
his
last
will
pause
this
satchel
contains
francs
worth
of
pearls
and
diamonds
if
i
wished
to
give
them
to
the
king
he
would
refuse
to
take
them
oh

to
you
ernest
i
have
the
right
to
say
wish
i
wish
you
dear

to
take
this
satchel
as
a
last
resource
to
bribe
a
gaoler
if
you
are
made

who

for
the
personal
needs
of
the

hang
it
round

put
it
in
your

but
in

upon
you

hush
here
is
your

at
this
moment
the
king
came
in
there
is
not
a
minute
to
spare
we
must
be
off
said
he
ten
minutes
ago
the
prussians
entered
hanover
the
king
embraced
the
queen
and
his
daughters
and
prince
ernest
his
mother
and
sisters
then
clinging
together
king
queen
prince
princesses
went
down
the
steps
before
which
the
horses
were
waiting
there
took
place
the
last
adieus
there
tears
flowed
from
the
eyes
of
the
most
valiant
as
well
as
from
those
of
the
most
resigned
the
king
set
an
example
by
mounting
his
horse
first
the
prince
and
benedict
rode
two
horses
exactly
alike
which
were
of
the
beautiful
hanoverian
race
crossed
with
an
english
strain
an
english
carbine
which
would
send
a
pointed
bullet
four
thousand
yards
hung
at
the
and
a
pair
of
pistols
as
true
as
duelling
pistols
rested
in
the
holsters
a
last
farewell
passed
between
the
riders
already
in
the
saddle
and
the
queen
and
princesses
on
the
steps
then
the
cavalcade
preceded
by
two
scouts
bearing
torches
started
at
a
quick
trot
a
later
they
were
in
hanover
benedict
proceeded
to
the
royal
hotel
to
settle
his
account
with
stephen
every
one
was
up
for
the
news
of
the
invasion
of
the
prussians
and
the
departure
of
the
king
had
already
spread
as
for
lenhart
he
was
invited
to
join
the
main
body
of
the
army
with
his
vehicle
the
rendezvous
as
we
know
was
at
göttingen
as
lenhart
was
greatly
attached
to
the
dog
frisk
benedict
did
not
hesitate
to
entrust
it
to
his
care
a
deputation
of
the
notabilities
of
the
town
with
the
burgomaster
at
their
head
waited
on
the
king
to
bid
him
farewell
the
king
his
voice
full
of
emotion
commended
his
wife
and
daughters
to
their
care
there
was
but
one
voice
in
assuring
him
of
their
devotion
the
whole
town
was
abroad
notwithstanding
the
hour
of
the
night
and
accompanied
him
shouting
live
the
king
long
live
george
v
may
he
return
victorious
again
the
king
commended
the
queen
and
the
princesses
not
now
to
the
deputation
but
to
the
whole
population
the
king
entered
the
royal
carriage
amid
a
concert
of
tears
and
sobs
one
would
have
said
that
every
daughter
had
just
lost
a
father
every
mother
a
son
every
sister
a
brother
women
crowded
to
the
door
of
his
carriage
to
kiss
his
hand
the
locomotive
had
to
whistle
five
or
six
times
and
the
signal
had
five
or
six
times
to
be
repeated
before
the
crowd
could
be
detached
from
the
carriage
doors
at
last
the
train
had
to
be
put
into
motion
so
as
to
shake
off
gently
and
almost
imperceptibly
the
clusters
of
men
and
women
who
clung
to
it
two
hours
later
göttingen
was
reached

was
on

and
as
each

of

or
infantry
arrived
the
king
warned
by
the
music
went
to
the
balcony
and
passed
it
in
review
they
filed
one
after
another
past
the
inn

on
their
helmets
and
cries
of
enthusiasm
on
their
lips

roused
by
the
cheering
warriors

the

there
had
not
been

to
recall

their

felt
joyously

with
them
from
their

and
all
along

to
have
been
in
the
valley
of
the
werra
to
warn
him
in
entering
prussia
and
crossing
mulhausen
that
he
should
proceed
towards
eisenach
he
added
that
he
was
followed
closely
by
three
or
four
prussian
regiments
who
united
would
make
twenty
or
thousand
men
they
arrived
at
eisenach
by
way
of
verkirchen
eisenach
defended
by
only
two
prussian
battalions
was
about
to
be
carried
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
when
a
courier
arrived
from
the
duke
of
gotha
on
whose
territory
they
were
bringing
a
dispatch
from
the
duke
the
dispatch
announced
that
an
armistice
was
arranged
the
duke
in
consequence
summoned
the
hanoverians
to
retire
unfortunately
as
it
came
from
a
prince
the
message
was
received
without
suspicion
the
vanguard
halted
and
took
up
its
quarters
where
it
was
next
day
eisenach
was
occupied
by
a
regiment
of
the
prussian
army
a
great
deal
of
time
and
many
men
had
been
lost
in
taking
eisenach
a
useless
manœuvre
and
they
resolved
to
leave
eisenach
on
the
right
and
to
proceed
to
gotha
in
order
to
put
this
project
into
execution
the
army
concentrated
on
langensalza
in
the
morning
the
king
left
having
on
his
left
major
schweppe
who
held
the
sovereign
horse
by
invisible
reins
the
prince
royal
was
on
his
right
having
with
him
count
platen
the
first
minister
and
in
the
various
uniforms
of
their
regiments
or
of
their
calling
count

and
herr
meding
the
cortège
left
langensalza
very
early
and
went
to
thannesbruck
benedict
rode
near
the
prince
fulfilling
the
functions
of
a
staff
officer
the
army
had
left
its
cantonments
in
order
to
proceed
to
gotha
but
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
vanguard
as
it
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
unstrut
was
attacked
by
two
prussian
regiments
commanded
by
the
generals
flies
and
seckendorff
they
were
able
to
mount
nearly
a
thousand
men
both
troops
of
the
guard
and
among
these
regiments
of
the
guard
was
that
of
queen
augusta
one
of
the
élite
the
rapidity
of
the
prussian
fire
showed
at
once
that
they
must
be
armed
at
least
the
greater
part
of
them
with
rifles
the
king
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
in
order
to
arrive
as
soon
as
possible
on
the
spot
where
the
battle
had
begun
the
little
village
of
merscleben
was
on
a
hill
to
the
left
behind
the
village
on
higher
ground
than
the
prussian
artillery
posts
they
placed
four
batteries
which
at
once
opened
fire
the
king
desired
to
be
informed
of
the
disposition
of
the
field
in
front
of
him
running
to
the
right
and
left
was
the
unstrut
and
its
marshes
then
a
great
thicket
or
rather
a
wood
called
badenwaeldschen
and
behind
the
unstrut
upon
the
steep
slope
of
the
mountain
the
prussian
masses
advancing
preceded
by
formidable
artillery
which
fired
as
it
came
is
there
a
higher
point
whence
i
can
direct
the
battle
asked
the
king
there
is
a
hill
half
a
kilometre
from
the
unstrut
but
it
is
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
that
is
the
place
for
me
said
the
king
come
gentlemen
pardon
sire
said
the
prince
but
half
a
away
from
the
hill
where
your
majesty
wishes
to
establish
your
camp
there
is
a
sort
of
wood
of
alders
and
aspens
stretching
to
the
river
we
must
search
that
wood
order
fifty
skirmishers
to
go
down
to
the
river
that
will
be
unnecessary
sire
said
benedict
there
is
no
need
for
more
than
one
man
for
that
and
he
went
off
at
a
gallop
crossed
the
wood
in
every
direction
and
reappeared
there
is
no
one
there
sire
said
he
saluting
the
king
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
and
posted
himself
on
the
top
of
the
little
hill
his
horse
was
the
only
white
one
and
served
as
a
target
for
bullets
and
balls
the
king
wore
his
uniform
as
general
of
the
forces
blue
turned
up
with
red
the
prince
his
uniform
of
the
hussars
of
the
guard
battle
was
joined
the
prussians
had
driven
back
the
hanoverian
outposts
who
had
recrossed
the
river
and
a
hot
cannonade
was
exchanged
between
the
hanoverian
artillery
before
merscleben
and
prussians
on
the
other
side
of
the
unstrut
sire
said
benedict
do
you
fear
that
the
prussians
will
send
men
to
hold
the
wood
which
i
searched
just
now
and
will
fire
on
the
king
as
at
a
target
from
its
outskirts
only
three
hundred
metres
away
what
would
you
suggest
asked
the
prince
i
propose
monseigneur
to
take
fifty
men
and
go
to
guard
the
wood
our
fire
will
protect
you
as
the
enemy
approach
the
prince
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
king
who
nodded
approvingly
go
said
prince
ernest
but
for
heaven
sake
do
get
killed
benedict
showed
the
palm
of
his
hand
can
a
man
be
killed
who
has
a
double
line
of
life
on
his
hand
and
he
galloped
to
the
infantry
of
the
line
fifty
good
marksmen
for
me
said
he
in
german
a
hundred
presented
themselves
come
said
benedict
we
shall
not
be
too
many
he
left
his
horse
with
a
hussar
of
the
prince
regiment
and
threw
himself
into
the
underwood
at
the
head
of
his
men
who
scattered
they
had
scarcely
disappeared
among
the
trees
when
a
terrible
fusillade
burst
forth
two
hundred
men
had
just
passed
the
unstrut
but
as
they
were
ignorant
of
the
number
of
men
following
benedict
they
retreated
fighting
supposing
him
to
have
superior
forces
and
leaving
a
dozen
dead
in
the
wood
benedict
guarded
the
bank
of
the
unstrut
and
by
a
fire
kept
off
all
approach
the
king
had
been
recognized
the
bullets
whistled
around
him
and
even
between
his
horse
legs
sire
said
major
schweppe
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
seek
a
place
a
little
further
from
the
field
of
battle
why
so
asked
the
king
the
bullets
may
reach
your
majesty
what
does
it
matter
am
i
not
in
the
hands
of
the
lord
the
prince
came
up
to
his
father
sire
said
he
the
prussians
are
advancing
by
great
masses
towards
unstrut
despite
our
fire
what
are
the
infantry
doing
they
are
marching
to
take
the
offensive
and
they
march
well
as
on
parade
sire
the
hanoverian
troops
were
once
excellent
troops
in
spain
they
held
the
élite
of
the
french
troops
in
check
when
they
fight
before
their
king
they
will
prove
worthy
of
themselves
i
trust
and
in
fact
all
the
hanoverian
infantry
formed
in
column
advanced
with
the
calm
of
veterans
under
the
fire
of
the
prussian
batteries
after
having
been
a
moment
astounded
at
the
hail
of
bullets
which
the
muskets
rained
upon
them
they
continued
their
march
crossed
the
marshes
of
unstrut
took
the
thicket
of
badenwaeldschen
by
bayonet
and
struggled
hand
to
hand
with
the
enemy
for
a
moment
smoke
and
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
hid
the
general
aspect
of
the
battle
but
at
that
moment
a
horseman
was
seen
to
emerge
from
the
smoke
and
to
move
towards
the
hill
where
the
king
was
stationed
riding
in
hot
haste
and
mounted
on
the
horse
of
a
prussian
officer
it
was
benedict
who
had
killed
the
rider
in
order
to
take
his
horse
and
who
was
coming
to
say
that
the
prussians
had
commenced
the
attack
einem
einem
cried
the
king
haste
order
the
cavalry
to
charge
the
captain
hastened
he
was
a
giant
of
over
six
feet
the
most
vigorous
and
handsomest
man
in
the
army
he
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
crying
hurrah
a
minute
afterwards
a
sound
like
a
hurricane
was
heard
it
was
the
cuirassiers
of
the
guard
charging
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
enthusiasm
of
the
men
as
they
passed
the
base
of
the
hill
where
stood
the
heroic
king
who
wished
to
be
at
the
most
dangerous
post
cries
of
long
live
the
king
long
live
george
v
long
live
hanover
made
the
air
tremble
as
in
a
tempest
the
horses
tore
up
the
earth
like
an
earthquake
benedict
could
not
restrain
himself
he
put
his
spurs
to
his
horse
and
disappeared
in
the
ranks
of
the
cuirassiers
seeing
the
storm
which
was
bursting
upon
them
the
prussians
formed
into
squares
the
first
which
encountered
the
hanoverian
cavalry
disappeared
under
their
horses
feet
then
whilst
the
infantry
fired
in
their
faces
the
cuirassiers
took
the
prussian
army
on
the
flank
which
after
a
desperate
struggle
tried
to
retreat
in
order
but
ferociously
pursued
found
themselves
routed
the
prince
followed
these
movements
with
an
excellent
pair
of
field
glasses
and
described
everything
to
the
king
his
father
but
soon
his
glasses
followed
only
a
group
of
fifty
men
at
the
head
of
whom
was
captain
einem
whom
he
recognized
by
his
great
stature
and
of
whom
benedict
recognizable
by
his
blue
uniform
among
the
white
cuirassiers
was
one
the
squadron
passed
on
by
nagelstadt
and
proceeded
towards
the
last
prussian
battery
which
still
held
out
the
battery
fired
on
the
squadron
from
a
distance
of
thirty
yards
everything
vanished
in
the
smoke
twelve
or
fifteen
men
alone
remained
captain
einem
was
lying
under
his
horse
oh
poor
einem
cried
the
prince
what
has
happened
to
him
asked
the
king
i
think
he
is
dead
said
the
young
man
but
no
he
is
not
dead
there
is
benedict
helping
to
drag
him
from
under
his
horse
he
is
only
wounded
he
is
not
even
wounded
oh
father
father
there
are
only
seven
left
out
of
fifty
only
one
artilleryman
is
left
he
is
aiming
at
einem
he
is
firing
oh
father
you
are
losing
a
brave
officer
and
king
william
a
brave
soldier
the
artilleryman
has
killed
einem
with
a
shot
from
his
carbine
and
benedict
has
cut
him
down
at
his
gun
with
his
sabre
the
prussian
army
was
in
full
flight
the
victory
was
with
the
hanoverians
the
prussians
retired
to
gotha
the
rapidity
of
the
march
to
the
field
of
battle
had
so
fatigued
the
hanoverian
cavalry
that
they
could
not
pursue
the
fugitives
in
this
respect
the
advantages
of
the
battle
were
lost
the
results
were
eight
hundred
prisoners
two
thousand
dead
or
wounded
two
cannon
taken
the
king
rode
round
the
field
of
battle
to
complete
his
task
by
showing
himself
to
the
unhappy
wounded
benedict
had
become
an
artist
once
more
and
was
dreaming
of
his
picture
he
was
seated
on
the
first
piece
of
cannon
which
had
been
taken
and
was
sketching
a
general
view
of
the
battlefield
he
saw
that
the
prince
was
searching
among
the
killed
and
wounded
officers
of
the
cuirassiers
pardon
monseigneur
said
he
you
are
looking
for
the
brave
captain
einem
are
you
not
yes
said
the
prince
there
monseigneur
there
on
your
left
in
the
midst
of
that
heap
of
dead
oh
said
the
prince
i
saw
him
doing
miracles
can
you
believe
that
after
i
had
drawn
him
from
under
his
horse
he
stabbed
six
with
his
sabre
then
he
was
hit
for
the
first
time
and
fell
they
thought
he
was
dead
and
threw
themselves
upon
him
he
raised
himself
on
one
knee
and
killed
two
who
cried
to
him
to
surrender
then
he
stood
upright
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
last
surviving
artilleryman
sent
a
ball
into
his
forehead
which
killed
him
as
i
was
not
able
to
save
him
being
too
much
occupied
myself
i
avenged
him
then
presenting
his
sketch
to
the
prince
as
calmly
as
if
in
the
studio
do
you
think
that
is
right
he
asked
chapter
xx
in
which
benedict
prediction
continues
to
be
fulfilled
the
visit
to
the
field
of
battle
having
been
paid
the
king
followed
the
highway
and
entered
the
town
of
langensalza
he
established
his
headquarters
in
the
sharpshooters
barracks
the
had
given
orders
that
all
should
remain
quiet
during
the
night
his
majesty
first
care
was
to
send
by
three
different
routes
despatches
to
the
queen
to
tell
her
of
the
day
victory
and
to
ask
for
reinforcements
if
not
for
the
next
day
for
the
day
after
and
as
it
turned
out
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
prussians
they
were
too
thoroughly
beaten
not
to
wish
for
a
day
rest
the
night
was
gay
money
had
been
given
to
the
soldiers
and
they
were
told
to
pay
for
everything
they
had
the
bands
played
god
save
the
king
and
the
soldiers
sang
in
chorus
a
song
by
a
hanoverian
volunteer
to
the
polish
tune
a
thousand
soldiers
swear
on
bended
knee
the
next
day
was
spent
in
waiting
for
news
of
the
bavarian
army
and
in
sending
out
couriers
the
first
came
back
with
promises
which
were
never
kept
a
truce
until
morning
had
been
offered
to
the
prussians
so
that
the
dead
might
be
buried
the
prussians
refused
and
the
hanoverians
alone
proceeded
with
this
pious
work
the
soldiers
dug
great
trenches
feet
long
and
feet
wide
the
dead
were
placed
in
these
in
two
rows
four
thousand
armed
men
led
by
the
king
and
prince
stood
while
beethoven
funeral
march
was
played
over
each
grave
a
squadron
passed
and
fired
a
salute
by
way
of
military
mourning
the
municipal
officers
who
had
come
to
thank
the
king
for
his
orders
to
the
soldiers
which
had
been
strictly
carried
out
were
present
at
the
ceremony
at
eleven
in
the
evening
the
men
who
were
on
guard
towards
the
north
announced
that
a
large
prussian
army
was
arriving
by
way
of
mulhausen
it
proved
to
be
general
manteuffel
the
third
day
after
the
battle
the
hanoverian
army
had
received
no
news
of
the
bavarian
army
and
was
surrounded
by
men
towards
midday
a
came
with
a
flag
of
truce
from
general
manteuffel
to
propose
that
the
king
should
surrender
the
king
replied
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
but
that
he
his
son
his
his
officers
and
soldiers
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
preferred
to
die
unless
an
honourable
capitulation
were
offered
them
at
the
same
time
he
called
a
council
of
war
which
declared
unanimously
for
a
capitulation
as
long
as
it
was
honourable
there
was
indeed
no
choice
the
army
had
only
three
hundred
shells
left
and
rations
for
one
night
and
day
the
whole
court
the
king
included
had
dined
on
a
piece
of
boiled
beef
and
potatoes
the
soup
was
given
to
the
wounded
every
man
was
allowed
but
one
glass
of
bad
beer
each
article
of
the
capitulation
was
discussed
so
as
to
spin
out
the
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
speedy
arrival
of
the
bavarians
was
still
hoped
for
at
length
during
the
night
the
following
conditions
were
drawn
up
between
general
manteuffel
for
the
king
of
prussia
and
general
von
arentschild
for
the
king
of
hanover
the
hanoverian
army
was
to
be
disbanded
and
the
soldiers
sent
back
to
their
homes
all
the
officers
and
officers
were
to
go
free
they
were
to
retain
their
arms
and
equipments
the
king
of
prussia
was
to
guarantee
their
pay
the
king
the
prince
and
their
suite
were
to
be
free
to
go
wherever
they
wished
the
king
private
fortune
was
to
be
intact
and
inviolable
the
capitulation
being
signed
general
manteuffel
went
to
the
quarters
entering
his
cabinet
he
said
to
him
i
am
sorry
sire
to
present
myself
before
your
majesty
in
such
sad
circumstances
we
understand
all
that
your
majesty
suffers

prussians
who
have
known
jena
i
beg
your
majesty
to
tell
me
to
what
place
you
wish
to
retire
and
to
give
me
my
orders
it
shall
be
my
duty
to
see
that
you
suffer
no
inconvenience
on
your
journey
sir
replied
the
king
coldly
i
do
not
know
where
i
shall
await
the
finding
of
the
congress
which
has
to
decide
whether
i
shall
remain
king
or
become
once
more
a
simple
english
prince
probably
with
my
the
duke
of
or
with
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
austria
in
either
case
i
have
no
need
of
your
protection
for
which
i
thank
you
the
same
day
the
king
left
for
vienna
to
ask
permission
for
his
master
to
retire
through
the
austrian
states
as
soon
as
this
request
reached
vienna
one
of
the
emperor
left
to
serve
as
guide
and
escort
to
the
king
this
officer
was
the
bearer
of
the
medal
for
the
king
and
the
order
of
knighthood
for
the
prince
on
the
same
day
the
king
sent
as
messengers
to
announce
his
arrival
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
austria
herr
meding
representing
the
regency
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
herr
von
platen
and
the
minister
of
war
herr
von
brandis
the
prince
asked
benedict
to
accompany
him
as
benedict
had
never
seen
vienna
he
assented
but
upon
conditions
his
life
as
at
hanover
was
to
be
entirely
independent
of
the
court
he
still
had
to
arrange
lenhart
business
which
as
we
know
had
been
left
to
discretion
benedict
had
kept
lenhart
for
seventeen
days
he
now
gave
him
four
hundred
francs
and
one
hundred
more
as
a
gratuity
an
unexampled
generosity
to
which
lenhart
replied
by
declaring
his
attachment
to
the
house
of
hanover
to
be
such
that
he
would
never
return
to
brunswick
from
the
moment
when
brunswick
became
prussian
this
declaration
was
worth
two
hundred
francs
to
him
from
the
king
of
hanover
and
one
hundred
francs
from
the
prince
after
this
lenhart
resolution
was
fixed
he
sold
or
had
sold
all
the
carriages
and
horses
which
he
had
at
brunswick
and
with
the
proceeds
he
meant
to
set
up
a
livery
stable
in
frankfort
a
free
town
where
you
seldom
see
any
prussians
at
frankfort
his
brother
hans
was
in
service
with
one
of
the
best
families
in
the
town
that
of
chandroz
madame
chandroz
daughter
the
baroness
von
bülow
was
the
goddaughter
with
such
connections
he
could
be
sure
of
prospering
and
benedict
promised
him
his
custom
in
case
he
returned
to
frankfort
the
adieux
between
benedict
and
lenhart
were
most
affecting
and
still
more
so
between
lenhart
and
frisk
but
they
were
forced
to
part
lenhart
set
out
for
frankfort
the
king
the
prince
benedict
and
frisk
on
their
arrival
at
vienna
took
up
their
residence
in
the
little
château
of
frœhliche
wiederkehr
which
means
happy
return
in
this
way
benedict
prediction
to
the

realized

chapter

what
passed
at
frankfort
between
the
battles
of
langensalza
and
sadowa
frankfort
followed
from
afar
and
with
anxiety
the
struggle
which
went
on
in
the
other
parts
of
germany
but
she
did
not
believe
that
that
struggle
could
reach
even
her
by
june
prince
charles
of
bavaria
had
been
appointed
general
of
the
federated
troops
on
the
same
day
frankfort
heard
the
news
of
the
victory
of
langensalza
this
caused
great
joy
throughout
the
town
though
no
one
dared
to
show
it
on
june
rudolfstadt
and
the
hanseatic
towns
declared
that
they
withdrew
from
the
confederation
the
würtemberg
and
baden
regiments
were
in
the
town
the
soldiers
in
groups
of
four
and
five
went
gaily
about
the
streets
in
hackney
carriages
on
july
news
came
of
the
capitulation
of
the
hanoverian
army
on
july
mecklenburg
gotha
and
the
younger
branch
of
reuss
declared
that
they
withdrew
from
the
confederation
on
july
the
prussian
papers
accused
the
people
of
frankfort
of
having
turned
all
prussian
subjects
out
of
the
town
even
those
who
had
been
established
there
for
ten
years
and
of
having
illuminated
their
streets
on
the
news
of
the
victory
of
langensalza
they
had
not
done
so
but
the
falser
the
charge
the
more
it
frightened
the
people
of
frankfort
evidently
the
prussians
were
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
them
on
july
the
gloom
increased
news
came
of
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
between
königsgrätz
and
josephstadt
on
july
the
first
news
of
the
battle
of
sadowa
arrived
in
frankfort
everything
that
that
fatalist
speltz
had
said
with
regard
to
marshal
benedek
came
true
after
two
checks
he
lost
his
head
to
speak
in
the
language
of
herr
speltz
saturn
ruled
above
mars
and
jupiter
what
he
had
foreseen
in
another
direction
about
the
superior
equipment
of
the
prussians
in
conjunction
with
their
natural
courage
also
came
true
in
no
single
encounter
had
the
austrians
the
advantage
the
only
victory
gained
over
the
prussians
was
that
when
the
king
of
hanover
had
been
in
command
but
what
particularly
terrified
frankfort
was
the
order
given
by
the
commanding
officers
of
the
allies
army
to
make
entrenchments
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
on
this
occasion
the
senate
awoke
from
its
inactivity
it
arose
and
protested
to
the
diet
that
frankfort
was
an
unfortified
town
which
was
not
able
and
did
not
wish
to
be
defended
but
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
the
senate
the
troops
came
to
frankfort
on
july
a
fresh
regiment
was
announced
it
was
the
regiment
of
the
federated
army
under
the
orders
of
prince
alexander
of
hesse
composed
of
men
from
würtemberg
baden
and
hesse
and
an
austrian
brigade
commanded
by
count
monte
nuovo
they
had
scarcely
entered
frankfort
when
count
monte
nuovo
enquired
for
the
house
of
the
chandroz
family
and
got
himself
billeted
upon
the
widowed
madame
von
beling
who
resided
there
count
monte
nuovo
which
title
disguised
the
celebrated
name
of
neuburg
was
the
son
of
marie
louise
he
was
a
handsome
tall
fashionable
general
of
or
fifty
who
presented
himself
to
madame
von
beling
with
all
the
austrian
grace
and
courtesy
and
who
in
saluting
helen
let
fall
from
his
lips
the
name
of
karl
von
freyberg
helen
started
emma
had
excused
herself
as
the
wife
of
a
prussian
from
doing
the
honours
of
her
house
to
a
man
with
whom
her
husband
might
be
fighting
on
the
morrow
this
absence
gave
count
monte
nuovo
the
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
helen
helen
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
awaited
this
moment
with
impatience
count
said
she
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
you
mentioned
a
certain
name
the
name
of
a
man
who
adores
you
fräulein
the
name
of
my
said
helen
rising
count
monte
nuovo
bowed
and
signed
to
her
to
reseat
herself
i
know
it
fräulein
he
said
count
karl
is
my
friend
he
has
bidden
me
hand
you
this
letter
and
to
give
you
news
of
him
with
my
own
lips
helen
took
the
letter
thank
you
sir
she
said
and
eager
to
read
it
you
will
allow
me
wo
you
certainly
said
the
count
bowing
and
he
appeared
to
become
absorbed
in
a
portrait
of
herr
von
beling
in
his
uniform
the
letter
was
all
vows
of
love
and
protestations
of
tenderness
such
as
lovers
write
to
each
other
old
phrases
always
new
flowers
plucked
on
the
day
of
creation
and
after
six
thousand
years
as
sweet
as
on
the
first
day
having
finished
the
letter
as
count
monte
nuovo
still
looked
straight
at
the
portrait
sir
said
helen
in
a
low
voice
fräulein
answered
the
count
approaching
her
karl
lets
me
hope
that
you
will
give
me
some
details
yourself
and
he
adds
coming
to
grips
with
the
prussians
he
will
or
indeed
we
shall
perhaps
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
it
is
possible
fräulein
especially
if
we
meet
the
prussians
in
three
or
four
days
where
did
you
leave
him
at
vienna
where
he
was
organizing
his
volunteer
regiment
we
arranged
a
at
frankfort
my
friend
karl
von
freyberg
having
done
me
the
honour
of
wishing
to
serve
under
my
orders
he
tells
me
that
he
has
as
his
lieutenant
a
frenchman
whom
i
know
do
you
know
of
whom
he
is
speaking
yes
he
met
him
at
the
king
of
hanover
where
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
a
young
frenchman
called
benedict
turpin
ah
yes
said
helen
smiling
he
whom
my
wished
me
to
marry
in
gratitude
for
the
he
received
from
him
fräulein
said
count
monte
nuovo
these
things
are
riddles
to
me
and
a
little
to
me
also
said
helen
i
will
explain
to
you
and
she
told
him
what
she
knew
of
frederic
duel
with
benedict
she
had
scarcely
finished
when
some
one
simultaneously
knocked
and
rang
at
the
door
hans
went
to
open
it
and
a
voice
asking
for
madame
von
beling
and
reaching
her
ears
through
all
the
closed
doors
between
made
her
start
what
is
the
matter
fräulein
asked
count
monte
nuovo
you
are
quite
pale
i
recognize
that
voice
exclaimed
helen
at
the
same
moment
the
door
opened
and
hans
appeared
fräulein
said
he
it
is
count
karl
von
freyberg
ah
cried
helen
i
knew
it
where
is
he
what
is
he
doing
he
is
below
in
the
where
he
is
asking
madame
von
permission
to
pay
his
respects
to
you
do
you
recognize
the
gentleman
in
that
asked
count
monte
nuovo
another
man
would
not
even
have
asked
for
your
grandmother
but
have
flown
straight
to
you
and
i
could
have
pardoned
him
then
in
a
louder
voice
karl
dear
karl
she
said
this
way
karl
came
in
and
threw
himself
into
helen
arms
who
pressed
him
to
her
breast
then
looking
round
him
he
saw
count
monte
nuovo
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
excuse
me
count
said
he
for
not
having
seen
you
before
but
you
will
readily
understand
that
i
had
eyes
for
none
but
her
is
not
helen
as
beautiful
as
i
told
you
count
more
beautiful
replied
he
oh
dear
dear
helen
cried
karl
falling
on
his
knees
and
kissing
her
hands
count
monte
nuovo
began
to
laugh
my
dear
karl
said
he
i
arrived
here
an
hour
ago
i
asked
to
be
quartered
at
madame
von
beling
in
order
to
be
able
to
carry
out
my
commission
it
was
done
as
you
knocked
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
here
if
i
have
forgotten
anything
here
you
are
and
you
can
supply
it
fräulein
may
i
have
the
honour
of
kissing
your
hand
helen
held
out
her
hand
looking
at
karl
as
if
for
his
permission
which
he
gave
with
a
nod
the
count
kissed
helen
hand
then
that
of
his
friend
and
went
out
the
lovers
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
fate
gave
them
amid
all
the
reverses
of
their
political
fortunes
one
of
those
rare
moments
which
she
grants
to
those
whom
she
favours
most
the
news
from
the
north
was
only
too
true
but
all
hope
was
not
lost
in
vienna
the
emperor
the
imperial
family
and
the
treasury
had
retired
to
pest
and
a
desperate
resistance
was
being
prepared
on
the
other
hand
the
cession
of
venice
to
italy
gave
liberty
to
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
men
as
a
reinforcement
to
the
army
in
the
north
it
only
remained
to
revive
the
spirits
of
the
soldiers
by
a
victory
and
it
was
hoped
that
count
alexander
of
hesse
would
gain
that
victory
the
battle
would
take
place
in
all
probability
in
the
outskirts
of
frankfort
this
is
why
karl
had
chosen
to
serve
in
the
prince
of
hesse
army
and
in
count
monte
nuovo
brigade
there
at
least
he
was
sure
that
he
should
see
fighting
a
second
cousin
of
the
emperor
francis
joseph
brave
and
courageous
he
had
every
interest
in
risking
his
life
for
the
house
of
austria
to
which
he
belonged
helen
devoured
karl
with
her
eyes
his
dress
was
that
which
she
had
seen
him
wear
every
day
when
she
met
him
going
or
returning
from
the
hunt
but
without
one
being
able
to
be
precise
about
it
there
was
something
more
warlike
about
him
his
expression
was
somewhat
more
severe
one
felt
that
he
was
conscious
of
danger
at
hand
and
in
meeting
it
like
a
man
he
met
it
as
one
who
clung
to
life
yet
who
above
his
life
put
honour
during
this
time
earl
little
troop
whose
second
in
command
was
benedict
bivouacked
a
hundred
paces
from
the
railway
station
just
under
the
burgomaster
fellner
windows
not
that
they
had
anything
to
complain
of
from
the
authorities
karl
had
sold
one
of
his
estates
and
each
of
his
men
received
a
shilling
every
day
for
food
each
man
was
armed
with
a
good
carbine
and
able
like
a
gun
to
fire
eight
or
ten
shots
a
minute
each
man
also
carried
a
hundred
cartridges
and
in
consequence
the
hundred
men
could
fire
ten
thousand
shots
the
two
leaders
carried
carbines
the
burgomaster
returning
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
found
in
front
of
his
door
the
little
detachment
dressed
in
an
unknown
uniform
he
stopped
with
that
naïve
bourgeois
curiosity
which
we
call
after
staring
at
the
soldiers
he
went
on
to
their
leader
before
whom
he
stopped
not
only
with
simple
curiosity
but
astonishment
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
face
of
the
leader
was
not
entirely
unknown
to
him
and
in
fact
the
officer
smiling
asked
in
excellent
german
may
i
enquire
after
burgomaster
fellner
health
ah
heavens
and
earth
cried
the
burgomaster
i
was
not
mistaken
it
is
benedict
turpin
bravo
i
told
you
that
your
memory
was
unusually
well
developed
it
must
be
so
to
recognize
me
in
this
costume
but
you
have
become
a
soldier
an
officer
an
officer
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
an
amateur
officer
come
up
to
my
house
you
must
be
in
need
of
refreshment
and
your
men
are
thirsty
are
you
my
friends
the
men
laughed
we
are
always
more
or
less
thirsty
one
of
them
replied
very
well
i
will
send
bottles
of
wine
and
beer
down
to
you
said
the
burgomaster
come
in
m
benedict
remember
that
my
eye
is
upon
you
from
the
window
said
benedict
and
be
careful
be
easy
in
your
mind
captain
replied
he
who
had
spoken
before
madame
fellner
said
the
burgomaster
on
entering
here
is
a
captain
of
volunteers
who
is
quartered
on
us
we
must
give
him
a
worthy
reception
madame
fellner
who
was
doing
worsted
work
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
guest
an
expression
resembling
her
husband
passed
over
her
face
oh
it
is
surprising
my
dear
she
cried
how
like
this
gentleman
is
to
a
young
french
painter
there
said
fellner
there
is
no
need
to
keep
your
incognito
pay
your
respects
to
my
wife
my
dear
benedict
you
are
recognized
benedict
held
out
his
hand
to
madame
fellner
as
for
the
burgomaster
a
slave
to
his
promise
he
looked
out
amongst
a
bunch
of
keys
that
of
the
cellar
and
went
down
to
choose
the
wine
in
which
he
wished
men
to
drink
his
health
a
few
minutes
after
shouts
of
long
live
the
burgomaster
told
that
his
wine
was
found
to
be
of
good
quality
chapter
xxii
the
free
meal
the
burgomaster
was
uneasy
and
did
not
try
to
hide
it
the
prussians
had
marched
on
frankfort
by
way
of
vogeberg
a
combat
was
bound
to
take
place
on
the
frontiers
of
bavaria
and
if
the
allies
army
was
beaten
the
prussians
would
occupy
frankfort
on
the
following
day
orders
had
been
given
of
which
no
one
knew
but
which
could
not
be
kept
from
him
as
burgomaster
on
july
that
is
to
say
on
the
third
day
the
federated
assembly
the
military
commission
and
the
office
had
received
orders
to
go
to
augsburg
a
proof
that
frankfort
was
not
sure
of
being
able
to
preserve
her
neutrality
the
conviction
held
by
every
one
in
frankfort
that
this
was
the
moment
of
supreme
crisis
had
raised
the
sympathy
of
the
inhabitants
for
the
defenders
of
the
cause
dear
to
all
that
is
to
say
the
cause
of
austria
to
the
highest
pitch
so
when
the
dinner
hour
came
the
great
houses
of
frankfort
invited
the
officers
while
the
bourgeois
and
working
people
invited
the
privates
some
took
dinner
to
them
others
laid
tables
before
their
doors
hermann
mumm
the
famous
wine
merchant
had
invited
a
hundred
privates
corporals
and
sergeants
and
had
laid
an
immense
table
before
his
door
where
each
man
had
his
bottle
of
wine
burgomaster
fellner
his
doctor
kugler
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
road
abutting
on
the
railway
station
took
care
of
karl
hundred
men
he
himself
dined
with
madame
von
beling
and
count
monte
nuovo
benedict
whom
good
madame
fellner
would
not
suffer
to
depart
could
not
refuse
her
invitation
they
had
invited
senators
von
bernus
and
speltz
but
they
had
each
their
own
guests
and
only
fischer
the
journalist
who
lived
a
bachelor
life
could
come
prince
alexander
of
hesse
dined
with
the
austrian
consul
the
diners
in
the
street
formed
strange
contrasts
with
those
inside
the
soldiers
drinking
together
careless
of
the
morrow
looked
for
nothing
but
death
but
death
to
a
soldier
is
only
a
in
black
who
pours
him
the
last
glass
of
brandy
at
the
end
of
the
last
day
the
soldier
only
fears
to
lose
his
life
because
in
losing
his
life
he
loses
all
with
it
and
at
one
blow
while
the
merchant
the
banker
even
the
bourgeois
before
losing
life
may
lose
fortune
credit
and
position
he
may
see
his
coffers
pillaged
his
house
ransacked
his
wife
and
daughters
dishonoured
his
children
calling
him
impotent
to
help
them
he
may
be
tortured
through
his
family
his
money
his
flesh
and
his
honour
it
was
of
these
things
that
the
citizens
of
the
free
town
of
frankfort
thought
and
these
things
prevented
them
from
being
as
gay
as
they
would
have
wished
with
their
guests
as
for
karl
and
helen
they
thought
of
nothing
but
their
happiness
for
them
the
present
was
everything
they
wished
to
forget
and
by
force
not
of
wishing
but
of
love
they
did
forget
but
the
saddest
of
these
gatherings
despite
benedict
efforts
was
certainly
that
which
took
place
at
the
burgomaster
herr
fellner
was
in
his
administrative
capacity
one
of
the
most
intelligent
burgomasters
that
frankfort
had
ever
possessed
furthermore
he
was
an
excellent
father
to
his
family
adoring
his
children
and
adored
by
them
during
fourteen
years
of
married
life
not
the
smallest
cloud
had
passed
across
his
union
during
the
whole
dinner
in
spite
of
the
weighty
political
preoccupation
which
absorbed
him
he
attempted
with
the
help
of
his
the
councillor
and
his
friend
fischer
to
throw
a
little
gaiety
over
the
solemnity
of
the
conversation
at
dessert
a
servant
entered
and
informed
benedict
that
his
travelling
companion
lenhart
asked
leave
to
offer
him
his
services
again
the
burgomaster
enquired
who
lenhart
was
and
at
the
moment
when
benedict
smilingly
asked
permission
to
go
and
shake
his
hand
in
the
vestibule
the
stable
keeper
slapped
the
servant
on
the
shoulder
to
make
him
give
way
and
came
in
saying
do
give
yourself
the
trouble
benedict
i
come
right
into
his
worship
the
burgomaster
i
am
not
proud
good
day
your
worship
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
ah
said
the
burgomaster
recognizing
the
old
saxon
accent
you
are
from
sachsenhausen
yes
and
my
name
is
lenhart
at
your
service
i
am
brother
to
hans
who
is
in
service
with
madame
von
beling
well
then
my
friend
said
the
burgomaster
drink
a
glass
of
wine
to
the
health
of
benedict
whom
you
wish
to
see
two
if
you
like
he
well
deserves
them
ah
there
no
with
regard
to
the
prussians
about
him
thunder
and
lightning
how
he
went
at
them
at
the
battle
of
langensalza
what
you
were
there
asked
the
burgomaster
of
lenhart
on
yes
that
i
was
and
now
mad
i
was
at
not
getting
a
slap
at
those
cuckoos
myself
why
do
you
call
them
cuckoos
asked
the
journalist
because
they
take
other
people
nests
to
lay
their
eggs
in
but
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
asked
benedict
a
little
embarrassed
by
this
unceremonious
visit
oh
said
lenhart
i
was
walking
peacefully
along
the
road
when
a
dog
came
and
jumped
at
my
neck
i
said
is
frisk
dog
your
men
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
curiosity
because
i
mentioned
your
name
benedict
here
i
asked
them
they
answered
me
he
is
there

is
dining
with
your
burgomaster
herr
fellner
a
good
man
who
has
good
wine
fellner

health
i
said
to
myself

is
my
burgomaster
because

since

established
in
frankfort
and
as
he
is
my
burgomaster
i
can
go
in
and
call
on
him
to
say
to
m
benedict
well
now
that
you
have
said
to
me
my
good
lenhart
and
drunk
the
health
of
his
worship
the
burgomaster
said
benedict
yes
but
i
have
drunk
yours
my
young
master
my
benefactor
my
idol
for
you
are
my
idol
benedict
when
i
speak
of
you
when
i
talk
about
your
duel
where
you
overcame
those
two
men
one
with
a
sabre
cut
and
what
a
one
it
was
frederic
de
you
know
the
one
i
mean
do
you
another
with
a
pistol
shot
that
was
a
journalist
a
great
tall
ungainly
fellow
like
you
herr
fischer
thanks
my
friend
i
have
said
any
harm
i
hope
no
but
leave
these
gentlemen
in
peace
said
benedict
they
are
very
peaceful
benedict
look
how
they
are
listening
let
him
go
on
said
the
doctor
i
go
on
all
the
same
even
if
you
would
let
me
ah
when
i
on
the
subject
of
benedict
i
never
run
dry
do
shrug
your
shoulders
benedict
if
you
wanted
to
kill
the
baron
you
have
killed
him
and
if
you
wanted
to
kill
the
journalist
you
only
yourself
to
please
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
the
burgomaster
we
have
seen
that
story
in
the
zeitung
my
word
i
read
it
without
ever
thinking
that
it
was
to
you
it
happened
and
the
pretty
thing
is
that
it
was
he
who
told
it
you
continued
lenhart
he
is
as
learned
as
a
sorcerer
only
glanced
at
the
poor
king
of
hanover
hand
and
he
foretold
everything
that
happened
to
him
first
the
victory
then
the
pill
at
the
moment
when
they
were
going
from
the
to
the
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
drums
was
heard
the
trumpet
sounded
to
horse
the
drum
beat
the
alert
madame
fellner
waited
impatiently
but
her
husband
smiling
signed
to
her
to
be
patient
for
the
moment
a
more
lively
and
more
general
preoccupation
was
started
by
the
sound
of
the
alarm
this
tells
me
madam
said
benedict
pointing
towards
the
street
i
have
only
time
to
drink
your
husband
health
and
to
the
long
and
happy
life
you
and
your
beautiful
family
will
have
with
him
the
toast
was
repeated
by
all
and
even
by
lenhart
who
thus
drank
twice
as
he
had
said
to
the
health
of
the
burgomaster
after
which
grasping
the
hands
of
herr
fellner
his
and
the
journalist
and
kissing
that
of
madame
fellner
benedict
ran
downstairs
and
out
crying
to
arms
the
same
warlike
sound
had
surprised
karl
and
helen
at
the
end
of
dinner
karl
felt
a
terrible
blow
at
his
heart
helen
grew
pale
although
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
beating
of
the
drums
nor
of
the
sounding
of
the
trumpets
yet
she
felt
it
to
be
sinister
then
at
the
glance
exchanged
between
count
monte
nuovo
and
karl
she
understood
that
the
moment
of
separation
had
come
the
count
had
pity
on
the
two
young
lovers
and
to
give
them
a
minute
for
their
last
adieux
he
took
leave
of
madame
von
beling
and
said
to
his
young
friend
karl
you
have
a
karl
threw
a
rapid
glance
at
the
clock
it
was
four
thank
you
general
he
answered
i
will
be
at
my
post
at
the
time
you
mention
madame
von
beling
had
gone
to
see
count
monte
nuovo
off
and
in
order
to
be
alone
the
young
people
went
into
the
garden
where
a
thick
arbour
of
vines
hid
their
adieux
one
might
as
well
try
to
write
down
the
melancholy
song
of
the
nightingale
which
burst
forth
a
few
paces
from
them
as
to
describe
the
dialogue
interspersed
with
sighs
and
tears
with
vows
with
sobs
with
promises
of
love
with
passionate
outbursts
and
with
tender
cries
what
had
they
said
at
the
end
of
a
nothing
and
everything
the
parting
was
inevitable
as
on
the
first
occasion
karl
horse
was
waiting
at
the
door
he
dragged
himself
away
leading
helen
with
him
encircled
by
his
arms
there
he
covered
her
face
with
a
rain
of
kisses
the
door
was
open
the
two
styrians
beckoned
him
a
quarter
to
five
was
striking
he
threw
himself
upon
his
horse
driving
the
spurs
into
him
the
two
styrians
ran
beside
him
following
the
galloping
horse
the
last
words
which
karl
heard
were
these
thine
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
and
with
the
ardour
of
a
lover
and
the
faith
of
a
christian
he
replied
so
be
it
chapter
xxiii
the
battle
of
aschaffenburg
during
his
dinner
prince
alexander
of
hesse
had
received
this
dispatch
the
prussian
vanguard
has
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
vogelsburg
pass
this
news
very
much
astonished
the
who
was
expecting
the
enemy
to
come
by
the
pass
through
the
thuringian
forest
he
had
in
consequence
immediately
sent
a
telegram
to
darmstadt
to
order
a
detachment
of
three
thousand
men
to
come
by
rail
to
aschaffenburg
and
seize
the
bridge
then
he
had
immediately
sounded
the
and
the
signal
to
saddle
two
steamboats
were
waiting
at
hackenhausen
a
hundred
railway
carriages
were
waiting
at
the
station
capable
of
holding
a
hundred
men
each
we
have
already
mentioned
the
effect
produced
by
the
double
trumpet
call
there
was
a
moment
of
confusion
for
a
moment
every
one
ran
to
and
fro
uniforms
were
confused
cavalry
and
infantry
were
mixed
then
as
if
a
clever
hand
had
put
each
man
in
his
place
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
the
cavalry
were
mounted
and
the
infantry
had
their
proper
weapons
everything
was
ready
for
a
start
again
frankfort
showed
its
sympathy
not
exactly
to
the
austrians
but
to
the
defenders
of
austria
beer
was
handed
round
in
and
wine
in
jugfuls
gentlemen
of
the
first
houses
in
the
town
shook
hands
with
the
officers
fashionable
ladies
spoke
cheeringly
to
the
soldiers
a
hitherto
unknown
brotherhood
born
of
the
common
danger
reigned
over
the
free
town
people
called
from
windows
courage
victory
long
live
austria
long
live
the
allies
long
live
prince
alexander
of
hesse
marie
louise
son
was
greeted
for
his
part
with
cries
of
long
live
the
count
of
monte
nuovo
but
it
must
be
said
that
as
they
came
for
the
most
part
from
ladies
they
were
due
rather
to
his
fine
figure
and
military
bearing
than
to
his
royal
birth
karl
styrian
sharpshooters
received
orders
to
take
their
places
in
the
first
carriages
it
was
they
who
were
to
attack
the
prussians
they
went
gaily
into
the
station
with
no
other
music
than
the
count
two
flute
players
after
them
came
count
monte
nuovo
austrian
brigade
and
lastly
the
allies
of
hesse
and
würtemberg
the
italian
brigade
had
left
by
the
steamboats
protesting
against
what
they
had
to
do
and
declaring
they
would
never
fire
on
their
friends
the
prussians
for
their
enemies
the
austrians
the
train
went
off
carrying
men
rifles
guns
ammunition
horses
and
ambulances
an
hour
and
a
half
afterwards
they
were
at
aschaffenburg
night
was
beginning
to
fall
they
had
not
seen
the
prussians
prince
alexander
of
hesse
sent
a
party
out
to
reconnoitre
the
party
came
back
towards
eleven
at
night
after
having
fired
a
few
shots
at
the
prussians
at
two
hours
journey
from
aschaffenburg
a
peasant
who
had
crossed
the
pass
at
the
same
time
as
the
prussians
said
that
they
were
nearly
five
or
six
thousand
strong
and
that
they
had
stopped
because
they
were
waiting
for
a
body
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
which
was
late
the
numbers
promised
to
be
nearly
equal
it
was
found
necessary
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
main
and
to
protect
frankfort
and
darmstadt
by
gaining
the
victory
the
styrian
sharpshooters
were
placed
on
the
road
their
mission
was
to
do
the
greatest
amount
of
damage
possible
to
the
enemy
and
retire
leaving
the
infantry
and
cavalry
to
work
in
their
turn
and
to
rally
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
the
allies
only
means
of
retreat
and
to
defend
that
bridge
to
the
last
during
the
night
each
man
took
up
his
position
for
the
next
day
and
supped
and
slept
in
the
open
a
reserve
of
eight
hundred
men
had
been
lodged
in
aschaffenburg
to
defend
the
town
if
it
were
attacked
the
night
passed
without
disturbance
at
ten
karl
growing
impatient
mounted
his
horse
and
leaving
the
command
of
his
men
to
benedict
galloped
off
towards
the
prussians
who
at
last
were
beginning
to
march
in
the
course
of
his
gallop
karl
went
up
to
count
monte
nuovo
and
brought
back
the
guns
which
were
put
in
position
across
the
road
four
felled
trees
made
a
sort
of
entrenchment
for
the
artillery
karl
got
on
to
this
entrenchment
with
his
two
styrians
who
took
their
flutes
from
their
pockets
as
if
on
parade
and
began
to
play
their
sweetest
and
most
charming
airs
karl
could
resist
no
longer
in
a
minute
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
sent
on
the
wind
a
last
message
to
his
country
the
prussians
were
advancing
all
this
time
at
the
booming
of
the
two
austrian
guns
interrupted
our
three
musicians
who
put
their
flutes
back
into
their
pockets
and
took
up
their
rifles
the
two
volleys
were
well
aimed
they
killed
or
wounded
a
score
of
men
again
an
explosion
was
heard
and
a
second
messenger
of
death
swept
through
the
prussian
ranks
they
are
going
to
try
and
carry
the
guns
by
assault
said
karl
to
benedict
take
fifty
men
and
i
take
fifty
we
will
creep
through
the
little
wood
on
each
side
of
the
road
we
have
time
for
two
shots
each
we
must
kill
a
hundred
men
and
fifty
horses
let
ten
of
your
men
fire
at
the
horses
and
the
rest
at
the
men
benedict
took
fifty
men
and
crept
along
the
right
of
the
road
karl
did
the
same
and
crept
along
the
left
the
count
was
not
mistaken
cavalry
advanced
from
the
middle
on
the
first
rank
and
the
gleam
of
the
sabres
was
soon
visible
in
the
sunshine
then
was
heard
the
thunder
of
three
hundred
horses
galloping
forward
now
began
a
fusillade
on
both
sides
of
the
road
which
would
have
seemed
a
game
if
at
the
first
two
shots
the
colonel
and
the
lieutenant
had
not
been
shot
down
from
their
horses
and
if
at
each
shot
that
followed
those
two
a
man
or
a
horse
had
not
fallen
soon
the
road
was
strewn
with
dead
men
and
horses
the
first
ranks
could
not
advance
the
charge
stopped
a
hundred
paces
from
the
two
guns
which
kept
up
their
fire
and
completed
the
confusion
in
the
column
behind
them
the
prussians
had
brought
forward
the
artillery
and
had
placed
in
position
six
guns
to
silence
the
two
austrian
guns
but
our
sharpshooters
had
advanced
to
about
three
hundred
paces
from
the
battery
and
when
the
six
artillerymen
had
raised
the
match
to
fire
with
the
regularity
of
a
prussian
manœuvre
six
shots
were
fired
three
to
the
right
and
three
to
the
left
of
the
road
and
the
six
artillerymen
fell
dead
six
others
took
the
burning
match
and
fell
beside
their
comrades
meanwhile
the
two
austrian
guns
had
fired
and
demolished
one
of
the
prussian
guns
the
prussians
did
what
they
ought
to
have
done
at
first
that
is
they
attacked
the
styrian
sharpshooters
they
sent
out
five
hundred
prussian
sharpshooters
with
fixed
bayonets
then
on
both
sides
of
the
plain
began
a
terrible
fusillade
while
along
the
road
the
infantry
advanced
in
columns
firing
on
the
battery
as
they
came
the
artillerymen
harnessed
horses
to
the
guns
and
retreated
the
two
guns
by
retiring
left
the
neuberg
brigade
uncovered
a
hillock
a
little
distance
from
aschaffenburg
was
then
crowned
by
a
battery
of
six
guns
the
fire
of
which
raked
the
prussian
masses
the
count
himself
seeing
that
in
spite
of
the
fire
along
the
whole
line
the
prussians
were
advancing
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
and
charged
prince
alexander
ordered
all
the
baden
army
to
support
him
unfortunately
he
placed
the
italian
regiment
on
his
left
wing
and
for
the
second
time
the
italians
told
him
that
they
would
remain
neutral
exposed
to
the
shots
of
both
sides
but
would
not
fire
themselves
whether
by
chance
or
because
they
had
been
warned
of
this
neutrality
the
prussians
brought
their
principal
effort
to
bear
upon
this
left
wing
which
by
standing
still
allowed
the
enemy
to
unhorse
count
monte
nuovo
the
styrian
sharpshooters
had
done
marvels
they
had
lost
thirty
men
and
had
killed
more
than
three
hundred
of
the
enemy
then
according
to
their
orders
they
had
rallied
at
the
head
of
the
aschaffenburg
bridge
from
that
spot
karl
and
benedict
heard
a
quick
fusillade
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
it
was
the
prussian
right
wing
which
had
overthrown
prince
alexander
left
wing
and
was
attacking
the
suburbs
of
the
town
listen
said
karl
to
benedict
the
day
is
lost
fate
has
overtaken
the
of
austria
i
am
going
to
kill
myself
because
it
is
my
duty
but
you
who
are
not
tied
to
our
fortune
you
who
are
fighting
as
an
amateur
you
who
are
french
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
would
be
folly
for
you
to
kill
yourself
for
a
cause
which
is
not
your
own
and
not
even
that
with
which
you
agree
right
to
the
last
moment
then
when
you
know
that
all
resistance
is
useless
get
back
to
frankfort
go
to
helen
tell
her
that
i
am
dead
if
you
have
seen
me
die
or
that
i
am
in
retreat
on
darmstadt
or
würtzburg
with
the
remains
of
the
army
if
i
live
i
will
write
to
her
if
i
die
i
die
thinking
of
her
this
is
my
heart
testament
i
confide
it
to
you
benedict
pressed
karl
hand
now
proceeded
karl
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
soldier
duty
to
give
the
most
service
possible
to
the
last
moment
we
have
a
hundred
and
seventy
men
left
i
am
going
to
take
some
i
will
take
half
to
support
the
defenders
of
the
town
you
stay
with
the
others
at
the
bridge
do
your
best
here
i
will
do
my
best
wherever
i
am
do
you
hear
the
fusillade
coming
nearer
we
have
no
time
to
lose
we
must
say
farewell
the
two
young
men
threw
themselves
into
each
other
arms
then
karl
hurried
into
the
streets
and
disappeared
in
the
smoke
benedict
went
to
a
little
hill
covered
with
a
thicket
where
he
could
defend
himself
and
protect
the
bridge
he
was
scarcely
there
when
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
rapidly
approaching
it
was
the
baden
cavalry
which
had
been
driven
back
by
the
prussian
cuirassiers
the
first
fugitives
crossed
the
bridge
without
difficulty
but
soon
the
passage
was
obstructed
with
men
and
horses
and
the
first
ranks
were
forced
to
return
upon
those
who
followed
them
at
that
moment
a
volley
from
benedict
and
his
men
felled
fifty
men
and
twenty
horses
the
cuirassiers
stopped
astonished
and
courage
returned
to
the
baden
infantry
a
second
volley
followed
the
first
and
the
click
of
the
balls
on
the
cuirasses
could
be
heard
like
the
sound
of
hail
on
a
roof
thirty
men
and
horses
fell
the
cuirassiers
became
disordered
but
in
retiring
they
encountered
a
square
broken
by
the
lancers
which
fled
before
them
the
square
found
itself
between
the
spears
of
the
lancers
and
the
sabres
of
the
cuirassiers
benedict
saw
them
coming
mixed
with
the
lancers
and
cuirassiers
aim
at
the
officers
cried
benedict
and
he
himself
picked
out
a
captain
of
cuirassiers
and
fired
the
captain
fell
the
others
had
each
chosen
officers
but
found
it
more
convenient
to
choose
the
officers
of
the
lancers
death
thus
offered
a
larger
target
almost
all
the
officers
fell
and
the
horses
bounding
riderless
joined
the
squadron
men
were
still
continuing
to
crowd
the
bridge
suddenly
the
greater
part
of
the
allies
army
arrived
almost
upon
the
heels
of
the
enemy
at
the
same
time
in
the
street
of
the
burning
town
karl
was
retreating
with
his
usual
calm
he
killed
a
man
at
each
shot
he
was
a
ball
had
carried
away
his
styrian
cap
a
trickle
of
blood
was
running
down
his
cheek
the
two
young
men
greeted
each
other
from
afar
frisk
recognizing
karl
whom
he
considered
an
admirable
hunter
ran
towards
him
all
delight
at
seeing
him
again
at
that
moment
a
heavy
gallop
made
the
earth
shake
it
was
the
prussian
cuirassiers
returning
to
the
charge
through
the
dust
of
the
road
and
the
smoke
of
the
firing
could
be
seen
the
glitter
of
their
breastplates
helmets
and
sword
blades
they
made
a
hole
in
the
centre
of
the
baden
and
hessian
fugitives
and
penetrated
a
third
of
the
way
over
the
bridge
with
a
last
glance
benedict
saw
his
friend
fighting
against
a
captain
into
whose
throat
he
twice
thrust
his
bayonet
the
captain
fell
but
only
to
be
succeeded
by
two
cuirassiers
who
attacked
karl
sword
in
hand
two
shots
from
benedict
rifle
killed
one
and
wounded
the
other
then
he
saw
karl
carried
away
among
the
fugitives
crossing
the
bridge
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
rally
them
enclosed
on
all
sides
his
sole
path
to
hope
of
safety
was
the
bridge
he
threw
himself
upon
it
with
the
sixty
or
men
who
were
left
it
was
a
terrible
struggle
the
dead
were
trodden
under
foot
the
cuirassiers
like
giants
on
their
great
horses
stabbed
the
fugitives
with
their
shortened
swords
fire
on
them
cried
benedict
those
of
his
men
who
had
their
rifles
loaded
fired
seven
or
eight
cuirassiers
fell
the
bullets
rattled
on
the
breastplates
of
the
rest
a
fresh
charge
brought
the
cuirassiers
into
the
midst
of
the
styrian
infantry
pressed
by
two
horsemen
benedict
killed
one
with
his
bayonet
the
other
tried
to
crush
him
with
his
horse
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
he
drew
his
short
hunting
knife
and
thrust
it
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
horse
chest
the
horse
reared
with
a
scream
of
dismay
benedict
left
his
knife
with
its
living
sheath
ran
between
the
horse
legs
leapt
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
sprang
armed
as
he
was
into
the
main
as
he
fell
he
cast
a
last
look
at
the
spot
where
karl
had
disappeared
but
his
gaze
sought
his
friend
in
vain
it
was
about
five
in
the
evening
chapter
xxiv
the
executor
benedict
had
jumped
into
the
main
on
the
left
side
of
the
bridge
the
current
carried
him
towards
the
arches
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
looked
round
him
and
saw
a
boat
moored
to
one
of
them
a
man
was
lying
in
the
boat
benedict
swam
towards
him
with
one
hand
holding
his
rifle
above
the
water
with
the
other
the
boatman
seeing
him
coming
raised
his
oar
prussian
or
austrian
asked
he
french
answered
benedict
the
boatman
held
out
his
hand
benedict
dripping
as
he
was
jumped
into
the
boat
twenty
florins
he
said
if
we
are
in
dettingen
in
an
hour
we
have
the
current
with
us
and
i
will
row
with
you
that
will
be
easy
said
the
boatman
if
you
are
sure
you
will
keep
your
word
wait
a
minute
said
benedict
throwing
down
his
styrian
tunic
and
cap
and
feeling
in
his
pocket
here
are
ten
then
come
on
said
the
boatman
he
took
one
oar
benedict
took
the
other
the
boat
impelled
by
four
vigorous
arms
went
rapidly
down
the
river
the
struggle
was
still
continuing
men
and
horses
fell
from
the
bridge
into
the
stream
benedict
would
have
liked
to
stop
and
watch
the
spectacle
but
time
did
not
allow
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
little
boat
flying
down
stream
in
five
minutes
the
oarsmen
were
out
of
range
and
out
of
danger
while
passing
a
little
wood
on
the
edge
of
the
river
called
he
thought
he
saw
karl
fighting
desperately
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
prussians
but
as
the
uniform
of
all
the
styrians
was
alike
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
infantry
then
benedict
fancied
he
saw
a
dog
like
frisk
in
the
throng
and
he
remembered
that
frisk
had
followed
karl
at
the
first
bend
of
the
river
they
ceased
to
see
anything
of
the
battle
further
on
they
saw
the
smoke
of
the
burning
houses
in
aschaffenburg
then
at
the
little
village
of
lieder
everything
disappeared
the
boat
flew
down
the
river
and
quickly
they
passed
menaschoft
stockstadt
kleim
and
ostheim
after
that
the
banks
of
the
main
were
deserted
down
to
mainflig
on
the
other
bank
almost
opposite
stood
dettingen
it
was
a
six
the
boatman
had
earned
his
twenty
florins
benedict
gave
them
to
him
but
before
parting
from
him
he
considered
for
a
moment
would
you
like
to
earn
twenty
florins
more
he
asked
i
should
just
think
so
replied
the
boatman
benedict
looked
at
his
watch
the
train
does
not
go
until
a
seven
we
have
more
than
an
hour
before
us
besides
which
the
trouble
at
aschaffenburg
will
make
the
train
another
quarter
of
an
hour
late
if
it
does
not
stop
it
altogether
the
deuce
it
will
will
what
i
tell

my
twenty

a
boatman
dress
like
yours
complete
you
know
then
come
back
and
i
will
tell
you
what
remains
to
be
done
the
boatman
jumped
out
of
the
boat
and
ran
down
the
road
to
dettingen
a
later
he
came
back
with
the
complete
costume
which
had
cost
ten
florins
benedict
gave
him
that
amount
and
now
asked
the
boatman
what
is
to
be
done
can
you
wait
for
me
here
three
days
with
my
uniform
my
rifle
and
my
pistols
i
will
give

florins
yes

of
three
days

not
come

rifle
the
pistols
and
the
uniform

be
yours
i
will

days
gentlemen

have
time
to
settle
their
affairs
you
are
a
good
fellow
what
is
your
name
fritz
very
well
fritz
goodbye
in
a
few
moments
benedict
had
put
on
the
coat
and
trousers
and
covered
his
head
with
the
boatman
cap
he
walked
a
few
steps
and
then
stopped
suddenly
by
the
way
where
will
you
stay
at
dettingen
he
asked
a
boatman
is
like
a
snail
he
carries
his
house
on
his
back
you
will
find
me
in
my
boat
night
and
day
night
and
day
all
is
well
then
and
in
his
turn
benedict
went
towards
dettingen
fritz
had
prophesied
truly
the
train
was
half
an
hour
late
indeed
it
was
the
last
train
which
went
through
hussars
were
sent
to
take
up
the
rails
lest
troops
should
be
sent
to
frankfort
to
help
the
allies
benedict
took
a
ticket
as
befitted
his
humble
costume
the
train
only
stopped
at
manau
for
a
few
minutes
and
arrived
at
frankfort
at
a
quarter
to
nine
scarcely
ten
minutes
late
the
station
was
full
of
people
who
had
come
to
get
news
benedict
passed
through
the
crowd
as
quickly
as
possible
recognized
fellner
whispered
in
his
ear
beaten
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
the
chandroz
house
he
knocked
at
the
door
hans
opened
it
helen
was
not
in
the
house
but
he
went
and
asked
for
emma
helen
was
at
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
benedict
asked
the
way
there
and
hans
who
thought
he
brought
news
of
karl
offered
to
show
him
in
five
minutes
they
were
there
hans
wished
to
go
back
but
benedict
kept
him
in
case
there
might
be
some
order
to
be
given
he
left
him
in
the
porch
and
went
in
one
chapel
was
hit
by
the
trembling
light
of
a
lamp
a
woman
was
kneeling
before
the
altar
or
rather
crouching
on
the
steps
this
woman
was
helen
the
eleven
train
had
brought
the
news
that
a
battle
would
take
place
that
day
at
twelve
helen
and
her
maid
had
taken
a
carriage
and
driven
by
hans
had
gone
down
the
aschaffenburg
road
as
far
as
the
dornighem
wood
there
in
the
country
silence
they
had
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
each
shot
had
had
an
echo
in
her
heart
soon
she
could
listen
no
longer
to
the
sound
which
grew
louder
and
louder
she
went
back
to
frankfort
and
got
down
at
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
sending
back
hans
to
ease
the
minds
of
her
mother
and
sister
hans
had
not
dared
to
say
where
helen
was
without
the
permission
of
the
baroness
helen
had
been
praying
since
three
at
the
sound
of
approach
she
turned
at
first
sight
and
in
his
disguise
she
did
not
recognize
the
young
painter
whom
frederic
had
wished
her
to
marry
and
took
him
for
a
sachsenhausen
fisherman
are
you
looking
for
me
my
good
man
she
said
yes
answered
benedict
then
you
are
bringing
me
news
of
karl
i
was
his
companion
in
the
fight
he
is
dead
cried
helen
wringing
her
hands
with
a
sob
and
glancing
reproachfully
at
the
statue
of
the
madonna
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
i
can
not
tell
you
for
certain
that
he
is
alive
and
not
wounded
but
i
can
tell
you
i
do
not
know
that
he
is
dead
you
do
know
no
on
my
honour
i
do
know
did
he
give
you
a
message
for
me
before
you
left
him
yes
these
are
his
very
words
oh
speak
speak
and
helen
clasped
her
hands
and
sank
on
a
chair
in
front
of
benedict
as
though
before
a
sacred
messenger
a
message
from
those
whom
we
love
is
always
sacred
listen
he
said
to
me
day
is
lost
fate
has
overtaken
the
house
of
austria
i
am
going
to
kill
myself
because
it
is
my
duty
helen
groaned
and
i
she
murmured
he
did
not
think
of
me
wait
he
went
on
but
you
who
are
not
tied
to
our
fortune
you
who
are
fighting
as
an
amateur
you
who
are
french
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
would
be
folly
for
you
to
kill
yourself
for
a
cause
which
is
not
your
own
fight
to
the
last
moment
then
when
you
know
that
all
resistance
is
vain
get
back
to
frankfort
go
to
helen
tell
her
that
i
am
dead
if
you
have
seen
me
die
or
that
i
am
in
retreat
for
darmstadt
or
würtzburg
with
the
remains
of
the
army
if
i
live
i
will
write
to
her
if
i
die
i
die
thinking
of
her
this
is
my
heart
testament
i
confide
it
to
you
dear
karl
and
then
twice
we
saw
each
other
in
the
fray
on
the
bridge
at
aschaffenburg
where
he
was
slightly
wounded
in
the
forehead
then
a
later
between
a

helen
threw
herself
on
her
knees
benedict
went
quickly
out
of
the
church
ten
minutes
later
he
came
back
with
all
the
necessary
things
for
the
dressing
of
wounds
and
four
torches

hans

if

karl

a
room

be
ready
for

and
a
surgeon
ready
also
his
arrival
would
cause
agitation
to
your
sister
scarcely
well
again
or
to
your
grandmother
whose
age
must
be
taken
into
consideration
what
time

four
in
the
morning

lenhart

dear
helen
i
am
ready
when
you
are
let
us
go
she
said
and
not
lose
a
minute
my
god
when
i
think
that
he
may
be
there
perhaps
lying
on
the
earth
under
some
tree
or
bush
bleeding
from
two
or
three
wounds
and
calling
on
me
with
his
dying
voice
for
help
and
in
high
agitation
she
went
on
i
am
coming
dear
karl
i
am
coming
lenhart
whipped
up
his
horses
and
the
carriage
went
off
as
quickly
as
the
wind
and
as
noisily
as
thunder
chapter
xxv
frisk
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
they
were
in
sight
of
dettingen
which
was
the
more
easy
to
see
because
it
appeared
from
afar
as
the
centre
of
a
vast
fire
as
they
drew
nearer
benedict
said
that
the
light
came
from
the
camp
fires
after
the
victory
the
prussians
had
pressed
their
outposts
beyond
the
little
town
helen
feared
that
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
continue
their
journey
but
benedict
reassured
her
the
pity
shown
to
the
wounded
and
the
respect
for
the
dead
in
all
civilized
countries
when
once
the
battle
is
over
left
him
no
doubt
that
helen
would
be
allowed
to
seek
for
her
dead
or
living
and
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
aid
her
in
fact
the
carriage
was
stopped
at
the
outposts
and
the
chiefs
of
the
watch
could
not
take
it
upon
themselves
to
let
them
pass
but
said
they
must
refer
to
general
sturm
who
commanded
the
outposts
general
sturm
had
his
quarters
in
the
little
village
of
horstein
rather
further
on
than
dettingen
benedict
was
told
where
the
house
was
and
went
off
at
a
gallop
to
make
up
for
lost
time
when
he
reached
the
house
indicated
he
found
that
general
sturm
was
away
and
that
he
would
have
to
speak
to
the
major
he
went
in
and
an
impatient
voice
called
out
wait
a
minute
benedict
had
heard
that
voice
before
frederic
he
cried
it
was
baron
frederic
von
bülow
whom
the
king
of
prussia
had
made
to
general
sturm
this
rank
was
an
advancement
from
benedict
explained
that
he
was
searching
for
karl
who
was
dead
or
wounded
on
the
field
frederic
would
have
liked
to
go
with
him
but
he
had
work
that
must
be
done
he
gave
benedict
a
permit
to
search
the
battlefield
and
to
take
with
him
two
prussian
soldiers
as
guards
and
a
surgeon
benedict
promised
to
send
back
the
surgeon
with
news
of
the
expedition
and
went
out
to
the
carriage
where
helen
was
waiting
impatiently
well
asked
she
i
have
got
what
we
want
answered
benedict
then
in
an
undertone
he
said
to
lenhart
go
on
twenty
paces
then
stop
he
told
helen
what
had
happened
and
that
if
she
wished
to
see
her
it
would
be
easy
to
go
back
helen
chafed
at
the
very
idea
of
seeing
her
he
would
be
sure
to
keep
her
from
going
among
the
dead
and
wounded
and
the
thieves
who
were
on
the
battlefield
to
rob
the
dead
she
thanked
benedict
and
cried
to
lenhart
drive
on
please
lenhart
whipped
up
his
horses
they
got
back
to
dettingen
eleven
struck
as
they
entered
the
town
an
immense
fire
was
burning
in
the
principal
square
benedict
got
down
and
went
towards
it
he
went
up
to
a
captain
who
was
walking
up
and
down
excuse
me
captain
he
said
but
do
you
know
baron
frederic
von
bülow
the
captain
looked
him
up
and
down
it
must
be
remembered
that
benedict
was
still
in
his
boatman
dress
yes
he
answered
i
know
him
and
what
then
will
you
do
him
a
great
service
willingly
he
is
my
friend
but
how
came
he
to
make
you
his
messenger
he
is
at
horstein
and
obliged
to
stay
there
by
order
of
general
sturm
he
is
very
uneasy
about
a
friend
of
his
who
was
killed
or
wounded
on
the
field
he
sent
me
and
a
comrade
to
search
for
this
friend
the
of
the
lady
whom
you
see
in
the
carriage
and
said
this
note
to
the
first
prussian
officer
you
see
tell
him
to
read
it
and
i
am
sure
he
will
have
the
kindness
to
give
you
what
you
ask
for
the
officer
went
to
the
fire
and
read
what
follows
order
to
the
first
prussian
officer
whom
my
messenger
meets
to
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
bearer
two
soldiers
and
a
surgeon
the
two
soldiers
and
the
surgeon
will
follow
the
bearer
wherever
he
leads
them
from
the
quarters
of
general
horstein
eleven
at
night
by
order
general
sturm
principal
staff
officer
baron
frederic
von
bülow
discipline
and
obedience
are
the
two
chief
virtues
of
the
prussian
army
these
are
what
have
made
it
the
first
army
in
germany
the
captain
had
hardly
read
his
superior
order
when
he
dropped
the
haughty
look
which
he
had
assumed
for
the
poor
devil
of
a
boatman
hullo
he
called
to
the
soldiers
round
the
fire
two
volunteers
to
serve
the
principal
staff
officer
frederic
von
bülow
six
men
presented
themselves
that
good
you
and
you
said
the
captain
choosing
two
men
now
who
is
the
regiment
surgeon
herr
ludwig
wiederschall
answered
a
voice
where
is
he
billeted
here
in
the
square
answered
the
same
voice
tell
him
he
is
to
go
on
an
expedition
to
aschaffenburg
by
order
of
the
staff
officer
a
soldier
got
up
went
across
the
square
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
moment
after
he
came
back
with
the
benedict
thanked
the
captain
he
answered
that
he
was
very
happy
to
do
anything
for
the
baron
von
bülow
the
surgeon
was
in
a
bad
temper
because
he
had
been
roused
out
of
his
first
sleep
but
when
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
young
lady
beautiful
and
in
tears
he
made
his
excuses
for
having
kept
her
waiting
and
was
the
first
to
hasten
the
departure
the
carriage
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
by
a
gentle
slope
several
boats
were
anchored
there
benedict
called
in
a
loud
voice
fritz
at
the
second
call
a
man
stood
up
in
a
boat
and
said
here
i
am
benedict
issued
his
orders
every
one
took
their
places
in
the
boat
the
two
soldiers
in
the
prow
fritz
and
benedict
at
the
oars
and
the
surgeon
and
helen
in
the
stern
a
vigorous
stroke
sent
the
boat
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
it
was
less
easy
travelling
now
they
had
to
go
against
the
current
but
benedict
and
fritz
were
good
and
strong
rowers
the
boat
went
slowly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
they
were
far
from
dettingen
when
they
heard
the
clock
strike
midnight
they
passed
kleim
ostheim
menaschoft
then
lieder
then
aschaffenburg
benedict
stopped
a
little
below
the
bridge
it
was
there
that
he
wished
to
begin
his
search
the
torches
were
lit
and
carried
by
the
soldiers
the
battle
had
not
been
finished
until
dark
the
wounded
alone
had
been
carried
away
and
the
bridge
was
still
strewn
with
dead
against
whom
one
stumbled
in
the
dark
corners
and
who
could
be
seen
by
their
white
coats
in
the
light
ones
karl
with
his
grey
tunic
would
have
been
easily
recognized
if
among
prussians
and
austrians
but
benedict
was
too
sure
of
having
seen
him
below
the
bridge
to
waste
time
in
seeking
for
him
where
he
was
not
they
went
down
to
the
fields
strewn
with
clumps
of
trees
and
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
little
wood
called
the
night
was
dark
with
no
moon
there
were
no
stars
one
would
have
said
that
the
dust
and
smoke
of
battle
was
hanging
between
the
earth
and
the
sky
from
time
to
time
silent
flashes
of
lightning
lifted
the
horizon
like
an
immense
eyelid
a
ray
of
wan
light
leapt
out
and
lighted
up
the
landscape
for
a
second
with
bluish
light
suddenly
all
became
dark
again
between
the
flashes
the
only
light
which
appeared
on
the
left
bank
of
the
main
was
that
of
the
two
torches
carried
by
the
prussian
soldiers
which
made
a
circle
of
light
a
dozen
paces
across
helen
white
as
a
ghost
and
gliding
like
a
ghost
over
the
unevennesses
of
the
ground
as
if
they
were
walked
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
with
arms
outstretched
saying
there
there
there
wherever
she
thought
she
saw
motionless
corpses
lying
when
they
came
near
they
found
them
to
be
corpses
indeed
but
recognized
prussians
or
austrians
by
their
uniforms
from
time
to
time
also
they
saw
something
gliding
between
the
trees
and
heard
steps
hastening
away
these
were
of
some
of
the
miserable
robbers
of
the
dead
who
follow
a
modern
army
as
wolves
used
to
follow
ancient
armies
and
whom
they
disturbed
in
their
infamous
work
from
time
to
time
benedict
stopped
the
group
with
a
gesture
a
profound
silence
fell
and
in
this
silence
he
cried
karl
karl
helen
with
staring
eyes
and
holding
her
breath
seemed
like
a
statue
of
suspense
nothing
replied
and
the
little
troop
moved
on
from
time
to
time
helen
also
stopped
and
automatically
under
her
breath
as
if
she
was
afraid
of
her
own
voice
called
in
her
turn
karl
karl
karl
they
drew
near
the
little
wood
and
the
corpses
became
fewer
benedict
made
one
of
these
pauses
followed
by
silence
and
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
cried
karl
this
time
a
lugubrious
and
prolonged
cry
replied
which
sent
a
shudder
through
the
heart
of
the
bravest
what
is
that
cry
asked
the
surgeon
it
is
a
dog
howling
for
some
one
death
answered
fritz
can
it
be
murmured
benedict
then
he
went
on
over
here
over
here
directing
them
towards
the
voice
of
the
dog
my
god
cried
helen
have
you
any
hope
perhaps
come
come
and
without
waiting
for
the
torches
he
ran
ahead
when
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
cried
again
karl
the
same
lugubrious
lamentable
cry
was
heard
but
nearer
come
said
benedict
it
is
here
helen
leapt
over
the
ditch
entered
the
wood
and
without
thinking
of
her
muslin
dress
which
was
being
torn
to
rags
she
pushed
on
through
the
bushes
and
thorns
the
had
been
thoughtful
enough
to
follow
there
in
the
wood
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
robbers
fleeing
benedict
signed
a
halt
in
order
to
give
them
time
to
escape
then
all
was
silent
again
he
called
a
third
time
karl
this
time
a
howl
as
lamentable
as
the
two
first
answered
but
so
close
to
them
that
all
hearts
beat
quickly
the
men
recoiled
a
step
the
boatman
pointed
a
wolf
said
he
where
asked
benedict
there
said
fritz
pointing
do
you
see
his
eyes
shining
in
the
dark
like
two
coals
at
that
moment
a
flash
of
lightning
penetrated
the
trees
and
showed
distinctly
a
dog
sitting
beside
a
motionless
body
here
frisk
cried
benedict
the
dog
made
one
bound
to
his
master
neck
and
licked
his
face
then
again
taking
his
place
beside
the
corpse
he
howled
more
lamentably
than
ever
karl
is
there
said
benedict
helen
sprang
forward
for
she
understood
it
all
but
he
is
dead
continued
benedict
helen
cried
out
and
fell
on
karl
body
chapter
xxvi
the
wounded
man
the
torchbearers
had
come
up
and
a
group
picturesque
and
terrible
was
formed
by
the
bright
light
of
the
burning
resin
karl
had
not
been
plundered
like
the
other
corpses
the
dog
had
guarded
his
body
and
prevented
this
helen
was
stretched
upon
him
her
lips
to
his
weeping
and
groaning
benedict
was
on
his
knees
beside
her
with
the
dog
paws
on
his
shoulders
the
surgeon
stood
his
arms
folded
like
a
man
accustomed
to
death
and
its
sadness
fritz
had
thrust
his
head
through
the
leaves
of
a
every
one
was
silent
and
motionless
for
a
moment
suddenly
helen
cried
out
she
sprang
up
covered
with
karl
blood
her
face
haggard
and
her
hair
wild
they
all
looked
at
her
ah
she
cried
i
am
going
mad
then
falling
on
her
knees
karl
karl
karl
she
cried
what
is
it
asked
benedict
oh
have
pity
on
me
said
helen
but
i
thought
i
felt
a
breath
on
my
face
did
he
wait
for
me
to
give
his
last
sigh
excuse
me
madam
said
the
surgeon
but
if
he
whom
you
call
karl
is
not
dead
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
in
looking
to
him
oh
come
and
look
sir
said
helen
moving
quickly
to
one
side
the
surgeon
knelt
down
the
soldiers
brought
the
torches
near
and
karl
pale
but
still
handsome
face
was
seen
a
wound
in
his
head
had
covered
his
left
cheek
with
blood
and
he
would
have
been
unrecognizable
if
the
dog
had
not
licked
the
blood
away
from
his
face
as
it
flowed
the
surgeon
loosened
his
collar
then
he
raised
him
to
undo
his
tunic
the
wound
was
terrible
for
the
back
of
his
tunic
was
red
with
blood
the
surgeon
undid
his
coat
and
with
the
swiftness
of
habit
cut
his
coat
up
the
back
then
he
called
for
water
water
repeated
helen
in
an
automatic
voice
that
sounded
like
an
echo
the
river
was
only
fifty
paces
away
fritz
ran
to
it
and
brought
back
the
wooden
shoe
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
bail
out
the
boat
full
of
water
helen
gave
her
handkerchief
the
surgeon
dipped
into
the
water
and
began
to
wash
the
wounded
chest
while
benedict
supported
his
body
across
his
knees
it
was
only
then
that
they
saw
a
clot
of
blood
on
his
arm
this
was
a
third
wound
that
on
his
head
was
insignificant
that
in
his
chest
seemed
the
most
serious
at
first
but
an
artery
had
been
cut
in
his
right
arm
and
the
great
loss
of
blood
had
led
to
a
fainting
fit
during
which
the
blood
had
ceased
to
flow
helen
during
this
sad
examination
had
not
ceased
asking
is
he
dead
is
he
dead
we
are
going
to
see
said
the
surgeon
and
on
examination
it
proved
that
his
blood
still
flowed
karl
was
not
dead
he
lives
said
the
surgeon
helen
cried
out
and
fell
on
her
knees
what
must
we
do
to
bring
him
to
life
she
asked
the
artery
must
be
tied
said
the
surgeon
will
you
let
me
take
him
to
the
ambulance
oh
no
no
cried
helen
i
can
not
be
parted
from
him
do
you
think
he
will
bear
being
taken
to
frankfort
by
water
yes
and
i
confess
to
you
that
considering
the
interest
you
take
in
this
young
man
i
would
rather
some
one
else
performed
this
operation
now
if
you
have
any
way
of
taking
him
quickly
by
water
i
have
my
boat
said
fritz
and
if
this
gentleman
he
pointed
to
benedict
will
give
me
a
helping
hand
we
will
be
in
frankfort
in
three
hours
it
remains
to
be
seen
said
the
surgeon
considering
his
great
loss
of
blood
whether
he
will
live
three
hours
my
god
my
god
cried
helen
i
do
dare
to
ask
you
to
look
madam
but
the
earth
is
soaked
with
his
blood
helen
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
and
put
her
hand
before
her
eyes
while
talking
while
reassuring
while
frightening
helen
with
the
terrible
of
a
man
used
to
death
the
surgeon
was
binding
up
the
wound
in
karl
chest
you
say
you
fear
that
he
has
lost
too
much
blood
how
much
blood
can
one
lose
without
dying
asked
helen
it
depends
madam
what
have
i
to
fear
or
hope
for
asked
helen
you
have
to
hope
that
he
will
live
to
reach
frankfort
that
he
has
not
lost
as
much
blood
as
i
fear
he
has
and
that
a
clever
surgeon
will
tie
up
the
artery
you
have
to
fear
that
he
will
have
a
second
hæmorrhage
or
in
eight
or
ten
days
when
the
wound
is
healed
but
we
can
save
him
ca
we
nature
has
so
many
resources
that
we
must
always
hope
madam
well
said
helen
do
not
let
us
lose
an
instant
benedict
and
the
surgeon
took
the
torches
the
two
soldiers
carried
the
wounded
man
to
the
bank
they
laid
him
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
on
a
mattress
and
blanket
fetched
from
aschaffenburg
may
i
try
to
rouse
him
asked
helen
or
ought
i
to
leave
him
in
his
present
state
do
not
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
to
consciousness
madam
it
is
this
which
stops
the
hæmorrhage
and
if
the
artery
is
tied
before
he
wakes
all
may
be
well
they
all
took
their
places
in
the
boat
the
two
prussians
stood
holding
the
torches
helen
was
kneeling
the
surgeon
supported
the
wounded
man
benedict
and
fritz
rowed
frisk
who
did
not
seem
to
feel
pride
in
having
played
such
a
splendid
part
was
sitting
in
the
prow
this
time
well
ballasted
pulled
by
four
arms
vigorous
and
accustomed
to
the
exercise
the
boat
sped
like
a
swallow
over
the
surface
of
the
water
karl
remained
unconscious
the
doctor
had
thought
that
the
air
cooler
on
the
water
than
on
the
land
would
rouse
him
but
it
did
not
he
remained
motionless
and
gave
no
sign
of
life
they
arrived
at
dettingen
benedict
gave
a
handsome
reward
to
the
two
prussian
soldiers
and
asked
the
surgeon
whom
helen
could
only
thank
by
pressing
his
hands
to
tell
frederic
all
the
details
of
the
expedition
benedict
called
lenhart
who
was
sleeping
on
the
box
of
his
carriage
and
told
him
to
go
to
frankfort
as
fast
as
possible
and
tell
some
porters
to
wait
with
a
litter
on
the
banks
of
the
main
at
frankfort
as
for
him
with
helen
and
earl
he
continued
his
journey
by
water
that
being
the
smoothest
road
that
one
can
find
for
a
sick
man
towards
hanau
the
sky
began
to
get
light
a
great
band
of
rosy
silver
stretched
itself
above
the
bavarian
mountains
it
seemed
to
helen
that
the
wounded
man
shuddered
she
gave
a
cry
that
made
the
two
rowers
turn
then
without
another
movement
karl
opened
his
eyes
murmured
the
name
of
helen
and
closed
them
again
all
this
was
so
rapid
that
if
fritz
and
benedict
had
not
seen
it
with
her
she
would
have
doubted
it
that
opened
eye
that
gently
murmured
word
did
not
seem
a
return
to
life
but
the
dream
of
a
dying
man
the
sun
in
rising
sometimes
has
this
effect
on
the
dying
and
before
closing
for
ever
their
eyes
look
for
the
last
time
upon
the
sun
this
idea
came
to
helen
oh
heaven
she
murmured
with
sobs
is
he
breathing
his
last
sigh
benedict
left
the
oar
for
a
moment
and
went
to
karl
he
took
his
hand
felt
his
pulse
and
found
it
imperceptible
he
listened
to
his
heart
it
seemed
to
be
still
at
each
test
helen
murmured
oh
heaven
at
the
last
test
he
shared
her
doubts
he
took
out
a
lancet
which
he
always
carried
and
pricked
the
shoulder
of
the
wounded
man
who
did
not
feel
or
move
but
a
feeble
drop
of
blood
appeared
be
of
good
courage
he
is
still
alive
he
said
and
again
took
up
his
oar
helen
began
to
pray
since
the
evening
no
one
had
eaten
but
fritz
benedict
broke
a
piece
of
bread
and
gave
it
to
helen
she
refused
it
with
a
smile
they
reached
offenbach
and
could
see
frankfort
in
the
distance
silhouetted
against
the
sky
they
were
due
there
at
about
eight
at
eight
in
fact
the
boat
stopped
at
the
by
the
bridge
soon
they
saw
lenhart
and
his
carriage
and
close
to
him
a
litter
they
raised
the
wounded
man
with
the
same
precautions
as
before
put
him
in
the
litter
and
drew
the
curtains
round
him
benedict
wished
helen
to
go
in
lenhart
carriage
the
bodice
of
her
dress
was
stained
with
blood
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
large
shawl
and
walked
beside
the
litter
to
save
time
she
asked
benedict
to
go
and
seek
for
the
same
doctor
who
had
attended
the
baron
von
bülow
doctor
bodemacker
she
herself
crossed
all
the
town
from
the
sachsenhausen
strasse
to
her
mother
house
following
the
litter
which
bore
karl
people
watched
her
pass
with
astonishment
and
went
to
question
fritz
who
walked
behind
and
when
he
said
it
was
a
who
was
following
the
body
of
her
lover
and
as
every
one
knew
that
fräulein
helen
von
chandroz
was
engaged
to
count
karl
von
freyberg
they
recognized
the
beautiful
young
lady
and
stepped
back
bowing
respectfully
when
they
reached
the
house
the
door
was
already
open
her
grandmother
and
sister
were
waiting
on
each
side
of
the
door
and
as
she
passed
helen
took
a
hand
of
each
to
my
room
she
said
the
wounded
man
was
taken
to
her
room
and
laid
on
her
bed
at
that
moment
doctor
bodemacker
arrived
with
benedict
the
doctor
examined
karl
and
benedict
looked
on
with
anxiety
almost
equal
to
helen
who
saw
this
man
before
me
asked
the
doctor
who
bound
his
wounds
a
regimental
surgeon
answered
helen
why
did
he
not
tie
the
artery
it
was
at
night
by
torchlight
in
the
open
air
he
did
not
dare
he
told
me
to
get
a
cleverer
man
and
i
came
to
you
the
surgeon
looked
at
karl
uneasily
he
has
lost
a
quarter
of
his
blood
he
murmured
well
asked
helen
the
doctor
bent
his
head
doctor
cried
helen
do
tell
me
there
is
no
hope
it
is
always
said
that
people
quickly
recover
lost
blood
yes
replied
the
doctor
when
he
can
eat
but
never
mind
a
doctor
must
do
all
he
can
can
you
help
me
he
asked
benedict
yes
he
answered
i
have
some
idea
of
surgery
you
will
leave
the
room
wo
you
the
surgeon
asked
helen
not
for
the
world
she
cried
no
no
i
will
stay
to
the
end
the
operation
on
the
arm
was
finished
with
a
cleverness
which
astonished
benedict
now
said
the
doctor
ice
water
must
be
slowly
dropped
on
that
arm
some
ice
was
procured
and
in
five
minutes
was
upon
the
arm
now
said
the
doctor
we
shall
see
what
shall
we
see
asked
helen
anxiously
we
shall
see
the
effect
of
the
ice
water
all
three
were
standing
by
the
bed
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
most
interested
in
its
success
the
doctor
from
professional
pride
helen
from
her
great
love
of
the
wounded
man
or
benedict
from
his
friendship
with
karl
and
helen
at
the
first
drops
of
ice
water
which
fell
on
the
arm
karl
shuddered
visibly
then
his
eyelids
trembled
his
eyes
opened
and
he
looked
round
him
with
surprise
until
they
became
fixed
on
helen
a
faint
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
tried
to
speak
and
breathed
the
name
of
helen
he
must
not
speak
said
the
doctor
until
at
least
enough
my
beloved
said
helen
you
can
tell
me
you
love
me
chapter
xxvii
the
prussians
at
frankfort
in
frankfort
all
was
sorrow
and
dismay
at
the
news
of
the
defeat
the
inhabitants
were
deeply
apprehensive
of
their
treatment
by
the
prussians
since
seeing
what
had
occurred
in
hanover
on
the
evening
of
the
battle
as
we
have
said
the
news
of
the
disaster
had
reached
frankfort
and
from
the
next
day
the
the
conviction
that
its
occupation
would
be
immediate
had
cast
an
aspect
of
mourning
over
the
town
not
a
single
person
was
to
be
seen
on
the
fashionable
promenade
the
prussians
so
it
was
said
would
make
their
entry
on
the
after
midday
night
came
and
with
it
a
strange
solitude
in
the
streets
where
if
one
met
a
wayfarer
it
was
evident
from
his
hurry
that
he
was
on
urgent
business
carrying
perhaps
jewels
or
valuables
for
deposit
at
one
of
the
foreign
legations
at
an
early
hour
the
houses
had
been
shut
up
behind
the
bolted
doors
and
windows
one
guessed
that
the
inmates
were
silently
digging
holes
for
the
concealment
of
their
treasures
morning
came
and
everywhere
might
be
seen
affixed
placards
of
the
senate
reading
as
follows
the
king
of
prussia
royal
troops
will
make
their
entry
into
frankfort
and
its
suburbs
our
relations
with
them
will
therefore
be
materially
changed
from
what
they
were
when
they
were
in
garrison
here
the
senate
deplores
this
change
which
has
been
brought
about
in
the
relations
in
question
but
the
national
sacrifices
we
have
already
made
will
render
our
inevitable
pecuniary
losses
easy
in
comparison
with
what
we
have
already
lost
we
all
know
that
the
discipline
of
the
king
of
troops
is
admirable
in
circumstances
of
great
difficulty
the
senate
exhorts
all
alike
of
whatever
rank
or
position
to
give
a
friendly
reception
to
the
prussian
troops
the
frankfort
battalion
received
orders
to
hold
itself
ready
with
band
in
front
to
march
out
and
meet
the
prussians
and
do
them
honour
from
ten
in
the
morning
every
advantageous
spot
all
the
belfries
and
housetops
from
which
the
suburbs
and
particularly
the
road
from
aschaffenburg
could
be
seen
were
crowded
with
curious
spectators
towards
noon
the
prussians
were
descried
at
hanau
the
railway
brought
them
by
thousands
and
they
were
seen
occupying
as
if
by
magic
all
the
strategic
points
along
the
line
not
without
certain
precautions
which
indicated
their
uneasiness
as
to
what
might
portend
nothing
occurred
however
until
four
then
successive
trains
left
hanau
bearing
the
victorious
army
and
rolled
up
to
the
town
gates
until
seven
it
was
clear
that
general
falkenstein
now
waited
the
submission
of
the
municipality
perhaps
believing
that
the
keys
of
the
town
would
be
brought
him
on
a
silver
salver
he
waited
in
vain
all
was
silence
none
of
the
inhabitants
moved
and
the
prussian
soldiers
prominent
among
whom
were
the
cuirassiers
who
had
charged
so
vigorously
in
the
battle
seemed
spectres
in
their
great
cloaks
and
steel
helmets
in
the
evening
the
zeil
is
ever
a
melancholy
place
on
this
occasion
how
sad
it
looked
despair
seemed
inextricably
intermingled
with
its
brooding
shadows
in
which
stood
out
like
a
squadron
of
phantoms
the
prussian
cuirassiers
now
and
again
the
trumpets
sounded
sinister
fanfares
the
fact
that
the
prussians
were
germans
was
completely
forgotten
their
attitude
clearly
showed
that
they
were
enemies
suddenly
the
music
of
the
battalion
of
frankfort
broke
out
coming
from
the
further
side
of
the
town
it
met
the
prussians
at
the
top
of
the
zeil
drew
up
in
ranks
and
presented
arms
to
the
beating
of
the
drums
the
prussians
did
not
appear
to
notice
these
friendly
advances
two
cannons
arrived
at
a
gallop
one
was
trained
on
the
zeil
the
other
on
the
the
head
of
the
prussian
column
was
formed
on
the
schiller
square
and
commanded
the
zeil
for
a
the
cavalry
remained
in
line
on
horseback
then
they
dismounted
and
stood
awaiting
orders
this
kind
of
encampment
during
which
expectation
grew
tenser
lasted
until
eleven
then
all
at
once
as
the
clocks
struck
groups
of
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
men
detached
themselves
struck
on
the
doors
and
invaded
the
houses
no
order
had
been
given
in
the
town
for
the
provision
of
rations
and
wine
so
the
prussians
treating
frankfort
as
a
conquered
world
chose
the
most
comfortable
houses
in
which
to
establish
themselves
the
battalion
remained
a
presenting
arms
after
which
the
commanding
officer
ordered
muskets
to
be
grounded
the
band
continued
to
play
it
was
ordered
to
cease
after
two
hours
as
no
word
had
been
exchanged
between
the
battalion
and
the
prussian
army
the
former
received
the
order
to
retire
arms
lowered
as
for
a
funeral
it
was
the
funeral
of
frankfort
liberty
the
whole
night
passed
in
the
same
terrors
as
if
the
town
had
been
taken
by
assault
if
doors
opened
slowly
they
were
broken
cries
of
terror
were
heard
in
the
houses
and
no
one
dared
to
ask
what
caused
them
as
the
house
of
hermann
mumm
appeared
one
of
the
most
important
he
had
to
lodge
and
board
two
hundred
soldiers
and
fifteen
officers
this
first
night
another
house
that
of
madame
luttereth
lodged
fifty
men
who
amused
themselves
with
breaking
the
windows
and
furniture
on
the
alleged
pretext
that
she
had
given
evening
parties
and
balls
without
inviting
the
prussian
officers
in
garrison
accusations
of
this
kind
accusations
which
served
as
the
pretext
for
unheard
of
violence
were
preferred
against
all
classes
of
society
and
the
prussian
officers
said
to
their
men
you
have
a
right
to
get
all
you
can
from
these
frankfort
rascals
who
have
lent
austria
millions
without
charging
interest
it
was
vain
to
say
that
the
town
had
never
had
millions
in
its
coffers
that
had
it
had
them
such
a
loan
could
not
have
been
made
without
a
decree
of
the
senate
and
the
legislature
and
that
the
most
skilful
investigator
would
fail
to
find
a
trace
of
such
a
decree
the
officers
persisted
and
as
the
soldiers
had
no
need
to
be
encouraged
in
a
preliminary
pillage
while
waiting
the
great
day
of
plunder
which
had
been
promised
them
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
most
brutal
disorders
believing
themselves
authorized
by
the
hatred
of
their
chiefs
towards
the
unhappy
town
from
this
night
commenced
what
was
rightly
called
prussian
terror
at
frederic
von
bülow
who
knew
of
the
orders
to
treat
frankfort
as
a
hostile
city
had
had
a
guard
placed
at
the
chandroz
house
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
family
his
pretext
being
that
it
had
been
reserved
for
general
sturm
and
his
staff
daylight
dawned
and
presently
few
having
slept
all
the
world
was
abroad
lamenting
their
misfortune
and
enquiring
about
those
suffered
by
their
friends
then
came
the
billstickers
slowly
and
unwillingly
like
men
under
constraint
fixing
up
the
following
notice
authority
having
been
given
me
over
the
duchy
of
nassau
the
town
of
frankfort
and
its
suburbs
as
also
over
that
part
of
bavaria
which
is
occupied
by
the
prussian
troops
and
over
the
of
hesse
all
workmen
and
functionaries
will
in
future
take
orders
from
me
these
orders
will
be
duly
and
formally
communicated
dated
at
frankfort
july
the
of
the
army
of
the
main
falkenstein
two
hours
later
the
general
addressed
a
note
to
the
deputies
fellner
and
müller
in
which
he
stated
that
as
armies
at
war
could
procure
what
they
had
need
of
in
the
enemy
country
the
town
of
frankfort
would
furnish
to
the
army
of
the
main
for
each
soldier
a
pair
of
boots
to
sample
three
hundred
good
horses
ready
saddled
to
replace
those
lost
by
the
army
the
pay
of
the
army
for
a
year
to
be
sent
instantly
to
the
army
treasurer
by
way
of
recompense
the
town
was
to
be
freed
from
all
imposts
except
cigars
the
general
engaging
furthermore
to
reduce
the
burden
of
the
military
billeting
as
much
as
possible
the
total
claimed
for
army
pay
was
florins
the
two
members
hastened
to
general
falkenstein
headquarters
and
were
admitted
to
him
his
first
words
were
well
sirs
have
you
brought
my
money
we
beg
leave
to
submit
to
your
excellency
said
fellner
that
we
have
no
authority
to
decree
payment
of
such
a
sum
as
the
government
of
the
town
having
been
dissolved
its
consent
can
not
be
obtained
that
does
not
concern
me
said
the
general
i
have
conquered
the
country
and
i
raise
an
indemnity
it
is
perfectly
regular
will
you
allow
me
to
say
to
your
excellency
that
a
town
which
does
not
defend
itself
can
not
be
conquered
frankfort
a
free
town
relies
for
its
defence
on
its
treaties
and
has
never
thought
of
opposing
your
army
frankfort
has
found
millions
for
the
austrians
cried
the
general
and
can
easily
find
fifteen
or
eighteen
for
us
but
if
it
refuses
i
myself
will
find
them
four
hours
only
of
pillage
and
we
shall
see
if
your
street
of
the
jews
and
the
coffers
of
your
bankers
do
not
produce
twice
as
much
i
doubt
general
said
fellner
coldly
whether
germans
can
be
got
to
treat
germans
in
such
a
way
who
speaks
of
germans
i
have
a
polish
regiment
brought
expressly
we
have
done
no
harm
to
the
poles
we
have
afforded
them
a
refuge
against
you
whenever
they
required
it
the
poles
are
not
our
enemies
the
poles
will
not
pillage
frankfort
that
is
just
what
we
are
going
to
see
said
the
general
stamping
his
foot
with
one
of
those
oaths
of
which
the
prussians
enjoy
the
monopoly
i
do
care
a
damn
if
i
am
called
a
second
duke
of
alva
and
i
warn
you
that
if
at
six
the
money
is
not
paid
you
will
be
arrested
and
thrown
into
a
dungeon
which
you
will
leave
only
when
the
last
thaler
of
the
florins
is
paid
we
know
your
first
minister
maxim
is
right
dispose
of
us
as
you
wish
answered
fellner
at
five
the
men
whom
i
shall
order
to
receive
the
seven
million
florins
will
be
at
the
door
of
the
bank
in
readiness
to
transport
the
money
to
my
headquarters
then
he
added
so
that
the
burgomaster
could
hear
the
orders
arrest
and
bring
before
me
the
journalist
fischer
editor
in
chief
of
the
zeitung
i
shall
commence
with
him
in
dealing
with
the
newspaper
men
and
the
newspapers
two
hours
later
fischer
was
arrested
in
his
house
where
after
a
communication
from
fellner
he
had
remained
in
expectation
of
the
event
and
brought
to
headquarters
general
falkenstein
had
contrived
to
keep
himself
at
boiling
point
so
the
moment
he
saw
fischer
let
him
enter
he
said
in
the
third
person
which
in
germany
is
the
sign
of
the
most
profound
contempt
and
as
fischer
did
not
enter
as
quickly
as
the
general
wished
he
cried
a
thousand
thunders
if
he
hangs
back
shove
him
in
here
i
am
said
fischer
forewarned
of
your
intention
i
could
have
left
frankfort
but
it
is
my
custom
to
face
danger
oh
so
you
knew
that
you
would
be
in
danger
when
you
reached
me
an
unarmed
man
is
always
in
danger
from
a
powerful
armed
enemy
you
consider
me
your
enemy
then
the
indemnity
you
have
exacted
from
frankfort
and
your
threats
against
herr
fellner
are
not
those
of
a
friend
you
will
allow
oh
you
have
no
need
to
await
my
threats
and
orders
to
declare
yourself
my
enemy
we
know
your
paper
and
it
is
because
we
know
it
that
you
are
going
to
sign
the
following
declaration
sit
down
there
take
a
pen
and
write
i
take
a
pen
but
before
using
it
what
are
you
about
to
dictate
you
want
to
know
well
here
it
is
i
fischer
goullet
councillor
of
state
editor
in
chief
but
you
are
not
writing
finish
your
sentence
sir
and
if
i
decide
to
write
i
will
do
so
of
the
zeitung
acknowledge
myself
guilty
of
systematic
and
calumnious
hostility
towards
the
prussian
government
fischer
threw
down
the
pen
i
will
never
write
that
sir
said
he
it
is
false
tempests
and
thunders
cried
the
general
making
a
step
towards
him
you
give
me
the
lie
fischer
took
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
this
will
inform
you
better
than
i
can
sir
he
said
it
is
the
last
issue
of
my
paper
published
an
hour
before
your
entry
here
this
is
what
i
wrote
in
it
history
of
the
days
which
are
to
come
is
written
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
it
is
not
for
the
citizens
of
frankfort
to
change
anything
for
the
population
of
a
small
and
weak
state
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
succour
the
combatants
whether
friends
or
enemies
they
must
dress
wounds
nurse
the
sick
exercise
charity
towards
all
right
behaviour
is
as
much
the
duty
of
every
one
as
obedience
towards
the
responsible
authority
then
seeing
the
general
shrugging
his
shoulders
fischer
in
his
turn
took
a
step
forward
and
holding
out
his
paper
read
yourself
if
you
doubt
me
said
he
the
general
tore
it
from
his
hands
you
wrote
that
yesterday
he
said
white
with
rage
because
yesterday
you
felt
us
coming
because
yesterday
you
were
afraid
of
us
and
tearing
up
the
newspaper
he
crushed
it
into
a
ball
and
threw
it
in
the
councillor
face
shouting
you
are
a
coward
fischer
threw
a
wild
glance
around
him
as
if
for
a
weapon
with
which
to
avenge
this
insult
then
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
he
staggered
turned
round
with
a
strangled
cry
and
fell
in
a
heap
killed
by
the
bursting
of
a
blood
vessel
in
the
brain
the
general
went
to
him
pushed
him
with
his
foot
and
seeing
that
he
was
dead
throw
this
rascal
into
a
corner
said
he
to
his
soldiers
until
his
family
comes
to
fetch
him
the
soldiers
dragged
the
corpse
into
a
corner
of
the
meanwhile
fellner
fearing
that
harm
would
befall
his
friend
had
run
to
hannibal
fischer
the
journalist
father
and
had
told
him
of
the
general
orders
hannibal
fischer
was
an
old
man
of
eighty
he
went
to
the
headquarters
and
asked
for
his
son
the
son
had
been
seen
going
up
to
the
first
floor
where
general
falkenstein
held
his
audiences
but
no
one
had
seen
him
leave
the
old
man
went
up
and
asked
for
the
general
he
had
gone
to
lunch
and
his
door
was
closed
sit
down
there
said
some
one
he
may
return
can
not
you
tell
him
that
it
is
a
father
who
claims
his
son
what
on
asked
one
of
the
soldiers
my
son
councillor
fischer
who
was
arrested
this
morning
why
it
is
the
father
said
the
soldier
to
his
comrade
if
he
wants
his
son
let
him
take
him
said
the
other
how
take
him
said
the
old
man
bewildered
certainly
answered
the
soldier
there
he
is
waiting
for
you
and
he
pointed
to
the
corpse
in
the
corner
the
father
approached
the
body
knelt
on
one
knee
and
raised
his
head
then
they
have
killed
him
he
asked
the
soldiers
no
indeed
he
died
of
his
own
accord
the
father
kissed
the
corpse
on
the
forehead
these
are
unhappy
days
he
said
in
which
fathers
bury
their
children
then
he
went
down
called
a
street
porter
sent
him
for
three
of
his
mates
mounted
again
to
the
and
showing
them
the
body
take
my
son
he
said
and
bear
him
to
my
house
the
men
took
the
body
on
their
shoulders
and
bore
him
to
a
barrow
the
father
walked
before
it
and
pale
his
eyes
bathed
in
tears
and
to
all
who
questioned
him
about
this
strange
procession
carrying
a
dead
man
through
the
town
without
a
priest
replied
it
is
my
son
councillor
fischer
whom
the
prussians
have
killed
and
thus
the
news
spread
over
frankfort
chapter
xxviii
general
manteuffel
threats
at
five
in
the
afternoon
of
july
as
the
general
had
said
he
sent
to
the
bank
a
squad
of
eight
men
under
the
command
of
a
accompanied
by
two
men
with
for
the
seven
million
florins
his
notion
of
the
weight
of
the
coin
which
in
gold
would
amount
to
more
than
fifty
tons
must
have
been
a
curious
one
seeing
his
men
return
without
the
money
general
falkenstein
declared
that
if
it
were
not
forthcoming
the
next
day
he
would
permit
pillage
and
bombardment
meanwhile
the
members
bernus
and
speltz
were
arrested
and
conducted
to
the
when
having
left
them
in
view
behind
the
bars
for
two
hours
to
convince
every
one
of
his
power
over
the
town
authorities
he
sent
them
off
to
cologne
with
four
soldiers
and
a
letter
for
the
governor
this
act
of
brutality
had
its
effect
it
alarmed
a
great
many
influential
people
who
went
to
find
the
bank
manager
and
urge
him
to
advance
the
seven
millions
demanded
the
directors
of
the
bank
gave
way
and
the
money
was
paid
to
the
last
florin
on
july
the
same
day
the
city
battalion
was
disbanded
in
the
presence
of
the
prussian
colonel
von
der
goltz
the
soldiers
had
not
expected
this
and
some
of
the
oldest
of
them
shed
tears
at
the
same
time
the
prussians
took
their
fill
of
the
horses
they
requisitioned
seven
hundred
including
two
little
ponies
of
madame
de
rothschild
the
carriages
were
then
seized
and
if
a
lady
happened
to
take
a
cab
she
was
obliged
when
she
met
an
officer
in
search
of
one
to
get
out
in
the
mud
and
leave
him
to
take
her
place
two
orders
were
circulated
the

addressed
to
the
presidents
of
the
societies
some
kindly
words
upon
the
necessity
of
the
measures
taken
and
upon
the
actual
situation
in
general
you
ask
me
how
kindly
words
could
be
uttered
by

pale
and
seeing
the
drops
of
perspiration
on
their
forehead
as
he
sighed
deeply
the
children
began
to
cry
at
last
he
opened
it
but
seeing
his
pallor
as
he
read
all
rose
to
their
feet
awaiting
his
first
words
but
he
said
nothing
he
let
his

fall

insisted
on

citizens
dared
not
complain
for
the
soldiers
whatever
they
did
were
always
found
to
be
in
the
right
but
when
they
heard
of
this
new
exaction
of
general
manteuffel
used
as
they
were
to
theft
and
rapine
on
the
part
of
the
prussians
the
frankfortians
mute
with
astonishment
looked
at
each
other
not
being
able
to
grasp
the
extent
of
their
misfortune
as
soon
as
the
news
was
actually
billed
they
rushed
in
crowds
to
see
it
with
their
own
eyes
hours
were
spent
in
deploring
the
enemy
greed
but
nothing
was
done
towards
obeying
the
order
meanwhile
some
of
the
chief
citizens
de
rothschild
among
them
had
gone
to
seek
general
manteuffel
in
reply
to
their
observations
he
said
my
cannon
will
be
trained
upon
all
the
chief
points
of
the
town
and
if
in
three
days
i
have
not
half
of
the
contribution
and
the
rest
in
six
i
double
it
general
answered
de
rothschild
you
know
the
range
of
your
cannons
i
do
not
doubt
but
you
do
not
know
that
of
the
measures
you
are
taking
if
you
ruin
frankfort
you
ruin
the
neighbouring
provinces
very
well
gentlemen
answered
manteuffel
the

of
the
intervention
of
the
foreign
legations
those
of
france
russia
england
spain
and
belgium
on
july
masses
of
troops
were
put
in
movement
with
loaded
cannon
these
were
ranged
on
the
chief
spaces
in
the
town
at
the
same
time
batteries
were
established
on
the
muhlberger
and
the
roederberg
as
also
on

chapter
xxix
general
sturm
roeder
who
had
replaced
general
manteuffel
had
brought
with
him
general
sturm
and
his
brigade
baron
von
bülow
was
the
principal
staff
officer
of
this
brigade
and
as
we
have
related
on
the
day
the
prussians
entered
frankfort
he
had
safeguarded
the
chandroz
family
by
placing
four
men
and
a
in
their
house
the
bore
a
letter
for
madame
von
beling
informing
her
why
she
was
thus
garrisoned
and
urging
her
to
prepare
the
best
rooms
on
her
first
floor
for
general
sturm
and
his
suite
madame
von
beling
acted
on
these
instructions
and
the
men
had
better
rations
and
cigars
supplied
to
them
than
if
the
municipality
had
catered
for
them
after
the
surgeon
departure
karl
lay
still
unconscious
but
his
breathing
gradually
became
more
perceptible
towards
evening
he
uttered
a
sigh
opened
his
eyes
and
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
left
hand
seemed
to
beckon
helen
she
rushed
to
him
seized
his
hand
and
placed
her
lips
upon
it
benedict
wished
her
to
retire
promising
to
watch
over
karl
but
helen
refused
saying
that
no
one
but
herself
should
nurse
him
benedict
being
desirous
of
ridding
himself
of
the
sailor
clothes
in
which
he
had
descended
the
river
before
general
sturm
arrived
and
having
no
other
suit
left
the
house
to
get
a
new
outfit
lenhart
was
at
the
front
door
with
his
carriage
and
driving
to
the
port
he
soon
found
fritz
and
his
boat
there
was
his
uniform
with
his
pistols
and
carbine
he
took
them
and
put
them
in
the
carriage
frisk
who
had
spent
the
day
incessantly
watching
for
his
master
joyfully
jumped
in
benedict
gave
fritz
twenty
florins
and
sent
him
back
to
aschaffenburg
then
lenhart
took
him
to
a
tailor
where
he
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
an
outfit
next
he
took
a
bath
he
had
fought
during
the
whole
of
the
and
had
not
closed
his
eyes
during
hours
so
he
found
it
refreshing
afterwards
he
allowed
lenhart
to
take
him
to
his
own
house
and
there
he
got
between
the
sheets
when
he
awoke
it
was
ten
he
had
slept
for
six
hours
he
rushed
to
the
chandrozes
he
found
helen
as
he
had
left
her
kneeling
by
bed
she
raised
her
head
and
smiled
she
also
had
not
slept
for
thirty
hours
but
the
devotion
of
women
knows
no
bounds
nature
has
intended
them
for
sisters
of
charity
love
is
as
strong
as
life
itself
karl
seemed
to
sleep
it
was
evident
that
as
no
blood
flowed
to
it
the
brain
was
in
a
state
of
torpor
but
every
time
a
spoonful
of
syrup
of
digitalis
was
placed
in
his
mouth
he
absorbed
it
better
benedict
work
was
to
renew
the
ice
which
dripped
upon
the
arm
washing
the
wound
made
first
by
the
cuirassier
sabre
and
then
by
the
doctor
lancet
towards
eight
in
the
morning
emma
came
into
the
room
for
news
of
the
wounded
man
she
found
helen
asking
benedict
for
more
ice
he
was
an
entire
stranger
to
emma
but
by
a
flash
of
intuition
she
guessed
him
to
be
the
man
who
had
spared
her
husband
life
she
was
thanking
him
when
hans
came
to
announce
fellner
the
worthy
man
was
afraid
that
the
prussians
would
break
into
the
house
and
came
to
offer
his
services
while
they
were
talking
frederic
arrived
with
the
news
that
his
general
was
only
five
minutes
behind
him
nothing
can
describe
emma
joy
and
happiness
in
seeing
frederic
the
war
was
nearly
over
rumours
of
peace
became
stronger
her
frederic
was
then
out
of
danger
love
is
egoistic
scarcely
had
she
thought
of
what
was
happening
in
the
city
the
entry
of
the
prussians
their
exactions
their
imposts
their
brutalities
the
death
of
herr
fischer
all
these
seemed
vague
a
letter
from
frederic
had
been
the
important
event
frederic
it
was
he
whom
she
embraced
he
was
safe
and
sound
unwounded
and
no
longer
in
danger
keenly
interested
as
she
was
in
her
sister
and
karl
and
their
mutual
love
she
felt
how
fortunate
frederic
was
that
he
was
not
karl
frederic
went
up
to
karl
who
recognized
him
and
smiled
while
general
sturm
ate
a
splendid
dinner
frederic
to
whom
benedict
had
whispered
a
few
words
about
the
behaviour
of
the
prussians
at
frankfort
went
out
to
judge
for
himself
he
was
told
that
the
senate
was
sitting
and
he
went
in
the
senate
declared
that
the
demand
made
upon
it
being
impossible
of
fulfilment
it
submitted
itself
to
the
general
clemency
on
leaving
the
senate
frederic
saw
the
cannon
trained
on
the
town
the
crowds
round
all
the
posted
bills
he
saw
besides
entire
families
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
prussians
bivouacking
on
the
open
spaces
the
men
were
swearing
the
women
were
in
tears
a
mother
was
calling
for
vengeance
as
she
tended
her
child
of
ten
through
whose
arm
a
bayonet
had
been
thrust
without
knowing
what
he
did
the
unfortunate
child
had
followed
a
prussian
singing
the
song
that
the
people
of
sachsenhausen
had
made
on
the
prussians
warte
kuckuck
warte
bald
kommt
bonaparte
der
wird
alles
wieder
holen
was
ihr
hobt
bei
uns
gestohlen
the
prussian
had
used
his
bayonet
on
the
lad
but
instead
of
consoling
the
mother
and
calling
for
vengeance
with
her
the
had
signed
to
her
to
be
quiet
to
dry
her
tears
and
wipe
the
blood
away
so
great
was
the
general
terror
the
prussians
however
had
not
everywhere
had
a
like
experience
one
of
them
lodging
with
a
man
of
sachsenhausen
to
frighten
him
had
drawn
his
sabre
and
placed
it
on
the
table
the
man
without
offering
any
remark
had
gone
out
and
returned
within
five
minutes
with
an
iron
trident
which
he
in
his
turn
put
on
the
table
what
does
this
signify
the
prussian
had
asked
well
was
the
reply
you
wanted
to
show
me
that
you
had
a
fine
knife
and
i
have
wanted
to
convince
you
that
i
have
a
fine
fork
the
prussian
had
taken
the
joke
badly
he
had
tried
to
make
play
with
his
sabre
and
had
been
transfixed
to
the
wall
with
the
trident
passing
by
hermann
mumm
house
the
baron
noticed
him
sitting
at
his
door
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
he
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
mumm
looked
up
is
that
you
he
said
and
have
you
pillagers
also
pillagers
asked
frederic
come
and
see
look
at
my
china
which
my
family
for
three
generations
has
collected
all
broken
my
cellar
is
empty
and
naturally
so
for
i
have
been
lodging
two
hundred
soldiers
and
fifteen
officers
listen
to
them
and
frederic
heard
shouts
from
within
of
wine
more
wine
or
we
blow
the
place
to
pieces
with
cannon
balls
he
went
into
the
house
poor
mumm
fine
house
looked
like
a
stable
the
floors
were
covered
with
wine
straw
and
filth
not
a
window
remained
whole
not
an
article
of
furniture
was
unbroken
look
at
my
poor
tables
said
the
unhappy
mumm
at
them
have
sat
for
over
a
century
the
best
people
of
frankfort
yes
the
king
many
princes
and
the
members
of
the
diet
have
dined
at
them
not
a
year
ago
frau
and
fräulein
von
bismarck
complimented
me
on
the
collation
i
gave
them
and
now
days
of
horror
and
desolation
have
come
and
frankfort
is
lost
frederic
was
powerless
and
could
only
leave
the
place
he
well
knew
that
neither
general
roeder
nor
general
sturm
would
stop
the
pillaging
roeder
was
ruthless
sturm
was
mad
he
was
an
old
style
prussian
general
who
when
opposed
struck
down
the
obstacle
presently
he
met
baron
von
schele
the
since
the
entry
of
the
prussians
he
had
received
the
order
to
institute
a
censorship
unsealing
letters
and
drawing
up
reports
upon
those
who
discovered
hostile
feelings
to
the
prussian
government
he
had
refused
to
obey
and
his
successor
having
arrived
from
berlin
the
censorship
was
in
operation
von
schele
who
looked
on
frederic
as
a
frankfortian
rather
than
a
prussian
told
him
all
this
and
invited
him
and
his
friends
to
resist
he
reached
fellner
with
a
broken
heart
and
found
all
the
family
in
despair
fellner
had
just
received
the
official
intimation
of
the
refusal
of
the
chief
commercial
houses
to
pay
the
millions
demanded
by
the
prussians
and
the
decree
of
the
senate
in
the
matter
although
as
a
member
of
the
senate
he
knew
its
contents
he
was
it
mechanically
while
his
wife
and
children
sobbed
around
him
for
all
feared
what
excesses
the
prussians
might
commit
on
receipt
of
the
refusal
while
they
sat
together
fellner
was
informed
of
the
decision
just
come
to
by
the
legislative
assembly
that
a
deputation
should
be
sent
to
the
king
to
obtain
the
remission
of
the
imposition
of
millions
of
florins
exacted
by
general
manteuffel
ah
said
frederic
if
only
i
could
see
the
king
of
prussia
why
not
said
fellner
catching
at
a
straw
impossible
my
dear
fellner
i
am
only
a
soldier
when
a
general
commands
i
must
obey
but
if
the
millions
are
going
to
be
found
my
family
will
contribute
its
share
being
powerless
to
assist
fellner
he
left
him
and
had
walked
a
few
steps
when
a
soldier
saluted
and
asked
him
to
proceed
to
general
sturm
who
was
waiting
for
him
general
sturm
was
a
biggish
strongly
made
man
of
about
two
and
fifty
he
had
a
small
head
with
a
high
brow
his
round
face
was
red
and
when
he
was
angry
which
was
often
it
became
crimson
his
large
eyes
were
almost
always
injected
with
blood
and
he
glared
with
fixed
pupils
when
as
invariably
was
the
case
he
wished
to
be
obeyed
all
this
with
his
big
mouth
thin
lips
yellow
teeth
menacing
eyebrows
aquiline
nose
and
thick
short
red
neck
made
him
a
formidable
looking
man
his
voice
was
loud
and
penetrating
his
gestures
commanding
his
movements
brusque
and
rapid
he
walked
with
long
strides
he
despised
danger
but
nevertheless
seldom
encountered
any
unless
it
was
worth
his
while
he
had
a
passion
for
plumes
red
waving
colours
the
smell
of
powder
of
gaming
he
was
as
brusque
in
his
words
as
in
his
movements
violent
and
full
of
pride
he
brooked
contradictions
ill
and
readily
flew
into
a
passion
then
his
face
grew
a
his
grey
eyes
became
golden
and
seemed
to
emit
sparks
at
such
times
he
completely
forgot
all
the
decencies
of
life
he
swore
he
insulted
he
struck
nevertheless
he
had
some
common
sense
for
knowing
that
he
must
from
time
to
time
have
duels
to
fight
he
spent
his
spare
time
in
sword
exercise
and
pistol
shooting
with
the
of
the
regiment
and
it
must
be
allowed
that
he
was
a
performer
with
both
weapons
and
not
only
so
he
had
what
was
called
an
unfortunate
hand
and
where
another
would
have
wounded
slightly
he
wounded
badly
and
frequently
he
killed
his
adversary
this
had
happened
ten
or
twelve
times
his
real
name
was
which
means
peaceful
so
inappropriate
to
its
owner
that
he
received
the
surname
of
meaning
storm
or
tempest
by
this
name
he
was
always
known
he
had
made
a
reputation
for
ferocity
in
the
war
against
the
bavarians
in
when
frederic
presented
himself
he
was
relatively
calm
sitting
in
a
great
chair
and
it
was
rare
for
him
to
be
seated
he
almost
smiled
ah
it
is
you
he
said
i
was
asking
for
you
general
roeder
was
here
where
have
you
been
excuse
me
general
frederic
answered
i
had
gone
to
my
for
news
of
one
of
my
friends
who
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
battle
ah
yes
said
the
general
i
heard
about
him
an
austrian
it
is
too
good
of
you
to
enquire
about
such
imperial
vermin
i
should
like
to
see
thousand
of
them
lying
on
the
battlefield
where
i
would
let
them
rot
from
the
first
man
to
the
last
but
your
excellency
he
was
a
friend
oh
very
well
the
matter
is
not
in
question
i
am
satisfied
with
you
baron
said
general
sturm
in
the
same
voice
in
which
another
man
would
have
said
i
loathe
you
and
i
wish
to
do
something
for
you
frederic
bowed
general
roeder
was
asking
for
a
man
with
whom
i
am
well
pleased
to
carry
to
his
majesty
king
william
i
whom
god
preserve
the
two
austrian
and
hessian
flags
taken
by
us
in
the
battle
of
aschaffenburg
i
have
thought
of
you
dear
baron
will
you
accept
the
mission
your
excellency
replied
frederic
nothing
could
honour
or
delight
me
more
if
you
recollect
it
was
the
king
who
placed
me
near
you
to
bring
me
into
contact
with
the
king
in
such
circumstances
is
to
do
me
a
favour
and
to
do
him
i
dare
hope
a
pleasure
well
you
must
leave
within
the
hour
and
not
come
to
me
with
little
wife
or
grandmother
an
hour
suffices
for
embracing
all
the
grandmothers
and
all
the
wives
in
the
world
all
sisters
and
children
into
the
bargain
the
flags
are
in
the
there
within
the
hour
jump
on
the
train
on
your
way
to
bohemia
and
you
will
be
with
the
king
at
sadowa
here
is
your
letter
of
introduction
to
his
majesty
take
it
frederic
took
the
letter
and
saluted
his
heart
full
of
joy
he
had
not
had
to
ask
for
leave
as
if
the
general
had
read
had
known
his
dearest
wish
he
had
offered
it
and
with
it
had
done
him
a
favour
of
which
he
had
not
dreamt
in
two
bounds
he
had
reached
benedict
my
dear
friend
he
said
i
leave
for
sadowa
in
an
hour
but
hesitate
to
say
with
what
object
tell
me
all
the
same
said
benedict
well
i
am
taking
the
flags
captured
from
the
austrians
and
you
can
take
them
without
grieving
me
for
if
all
prussians
were
like
yourself
i
should
have
fought
with
them
and
not
with
the
hanoverians
and
austrians
said
benedict
now
go
and
say
your
adieux
he
was
still
embracing
his
wife
and
little
child
when
the
same
soldier
who
had
already
been
sent
to
him
called
to
ask
him
not
to
take
the
flags
without
exchanging
a
last
word
with
the
general
wait
wait
a
bit
cuckoo
bonaparte
is
coming
who
soon
will
force
you
to
restore
all
you
stole
from
us
before
chapter
xxx
the
breaking
of
the
storm
the
general
received
frederic
with
the
same
calm
and
gracious
expression
as
before
excuse
me
for
delaying
he
said
after
i
was
so
anxious
to
speed
you
but
i
have
a
little
service
to
ask
frederic
bowed
it
is
about
general
manteuffel
subsidy
of
millions
of
florins
you
know
about
it
do
you
yes
said
frederic
and
it
is
a
heavy
impost
for
a
poor
city
with
some
inhabitants
you
mean
said
sturm
no
there
are
only
about
frankfortians
the
remainder
of
the
counted
as
natives
are
strangers
what
does
that
matter
said
sturm
becoming
impatient
the
statistics
say
and
general
manteuffel
has
made
his
calculation
accordingly
but
if
he
has
made
an
error
it
seems
to
me
that
those
who
are
charged
with
the
execution
of
his
order
should
point
it
out
that
is
not
our
affair
we
are
told
inhabitants
and
there
therefore
are
we
are
told
million
florins
and
million
florins
there
are
also
that
is
all
just
fancy
the
senators
have
declared
that
we
can
burn
the
town
but
they
will
not
pay
the
subsidy
i
was
present
said
frederic
quietly
and
the
sitting
was
admirably
conducted
with
much
dignity
calm
and
sorrow
ta
ta
ta
ta
said
sturm
general
manteuffel
before
leaving
gave
general
roeder
the
order
to
get
in
these
millions
roeder
has
ordered
the
town
to
pay
them
the
senate
has
chosen
to
deliberate
that
is
its
own
affair
roeder
came
round
to
me
about
it
it
is
true
but
i
told
him
that
it
was
nothing
to
worry
about
i
said
chief
of
my
staff
married
in
frankfort
he
knows
the
town
like
his
own
land
fortune
even
to
shillings
and
he
will
indicate
five
and
twenty
millionaires
there
are
of
them
here
are
there
not
more
than
that
answered
frederic
good
we
will
commence
with
them
and
if
there
is
a
balance
the
others
shall
supply
it
and
have
you
reckoned
on
me
to
give
you
the
names
certainly
all
i
require
is
names
and
five
and
twenty
addresses
sit
down
there
my
dear
fellow
and
write
them
out
frederic
sat
down
took
a
pen
and
wrote
honour
obliging
me
to
decline
to
denounce
my
fellow
citizens
i
beg
the
illustrious
generals
von
roeder
and
sturm
to
obtain
the
desired
information
elsewhere
than
from
myself
frankfort
july
frederic
baron
von
bülow
then
rising
and
bowing
low
he
put
the
paper
in
the
general
hands
what
is
this
he
asked
read
it
general
said
frederic
the
general
read
it
and
gave
his
chief
of
the
staff
a
side
glance
ah
ah
he
said
i
see
how
i
am
answered
when
i
ask
a
favour
let
me
see
how
i
am
answered
when
i
command
sit
there
and
write
order
me
to
charge
a
battery
and
i
will
do
it
but
do
not
order
me
to
become
a
tax
collector
i
have
promised
general
roeder
to
get
him
the
names
and
addresses
and
have
told
him
that
you
will
supply
them
he
will
send
for
the
list
directly
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
you
will
tell
him
that
i
have
refused
to
give
it
sturm
crossed
his
arms
and
approached
frederic
and
do
you
think
that
i
will
allow
a
man
under
my
orders
to
refuse
me
anything
i
think
you
will
reflect
that
you
gave
me
not
only
an
unjust
but
a
dishonouring
order
and
you
will
appreciate
the
reason
of
my
refusal
let
me
go
general
and
call
a
police
officer
he
will
not
refuse
you
for
it
will
be
all
in
his
work
baron
replied
sturm
i
considered
i
was
sending
the
king
a
good
servant
for
whom
i
asked
a
reward
i
can
not
reward
a
man
of
whom
i
have
to
complain
give
me
back
his
majesty
letter
frederic
disdainfully
tossed
the
letter
on
the
table
the
general
face
grew
purple
livid
marks
appeared
upon
it
his
eyes
flamed
i
will
write
to
the
king
he
cried
furiously
and
he
will
learn
how
his
officers
serve
him
write
your
account
sir
and
i
will
write
mine
answered
frederic
and
he
will
see
how
his
generals
dishonour
him
sturm
rushed
and
seized
his
horsewhip
you
have
said
dishonoured
sir
you
will
not
repeat
the
word
i
trust
dishonoured
said
frederic
coldly
sturm
gave
a
cry
of
rage
and
raised
his
whip
to
strike
his
young
officer
but
observing
frederic
complete
calm
he
let
it
fall
who
threatens
strikes
sir
frederic
answered
and
it
is
as
if
you
had
struck
me
he
turned
to
the
table
and
wrote
a
few
lines
then
he
opened
the
door
of
the
and
calling
the
officers
who
were
there
gentlemen
he
said
i
confide
this
paper
to
your
loyalty
read
what
it
says
aloud
i
tender
my
resignation
as
chief
of
general
sturm
staff
and
officer
in
the
prussian
army
dated
at
noon
july
frederic
von
bülow
which
means
asked
sturm
which
means
that
i
am
no
longer
in
his
majesty
service
nor
in
yours
and
that
you
have
insulted
me
gentlemen
this
man
raised
his
horsewhip
over
me
and
having
insulted
me
you
owe
me
reparation
keep
my
resignation
gentlemen
and
bear
witness
that
i
am
free
from
all
military
duty
at
the
moment
i
tell
this
man
that
he
is
no
longer
my
chief
and
consequently
that
i
am
not
his
inferior
sir
you
have
injured
me
mortally
and
i
will
kill
you
or
you
will
kill
me
sturm
burst
out
laughing
you
give
your
resignation
he
said
well
i
do
not
accept
it
place
yourself
in
confinement
sir
said
he
stamping
his
foot
and
walking
towards
frederic
to
prison
for
fifteen
days
with
you
you
have
no
longer
the
right
to
give
me
an
order
said
frederic
detaching
his
epaulettes
sturm
exasperated
livid
foaming
at
the
mouth
again
raised
his
whip
upon
the
chief
of
his
staff
but
this
time
he
slashed
his
cheek
and
shoulder
with
it
frederic
who
until
now
had
held
himself
in
uttered
a
cry
of
rage
made
a
bound
aside
and
drew
his
sword
imbecile
shouted
sturm
with
a
burst
of
laughter
you
will
be
shot
after
a
court
martial
at
this
frederic
lost
his
head
completely
and
threw
himself
upon
the
general
but
he
found
four
officers
in
his
path
one
whispered
to
him
save
yourself
we
will
calm
him
and
i
said
frederic
i
who
have
been
struck
who
will
calm
me
we
give
you
our
word
of
honour
that
we
have
not
seen
the
blow
said
the
officers
but
have
it
and
as
i
have
given
my
word
of
honour
that
one
of
us
must
die
i
must
act
accordingly
adieu
gentlemen
two
of
the
officers
trying
to
follow
him
thunders
and
tempests
gentlemen
called
the
general
after
them
come
back
no
one
leaves
this
room
except
this
madman
who
will
be
arrested
by
the
provost
marshal
the
officers
came
back
hanging
their
heads
frederic
burst
out
of
the
room
the
first
person
he
met
on
the
stairs
was
the
old
baroness
von
beling
gracious
heavens
what
are
you
doing
with
a
drawn
sword
she
asked
he
put
the
sword
in
its
scabbard
then
he
ran
to
his
wife
and
embraced
her
and
the
baby
ten
minutes
later
an
explosion
was
heard
in
frederic
room
benedict
who
was
with
karl
rushed
to
it
and
burst
open
the
door
frederic
was
lying
on
the
floor
dead
his
forehead
shattered
by
a
bullet
he
had
left
this
note
on
the
table
struck
in
the
face
by
general
sturm
who
has
refused
to
give
me
satisfaction
i
could
not
live
dishonoured
my
last
wish
is
that
my
wife
in
her
widow
dress
should
leave
this
evening
for
berlin
and
there
beg
from
her
majesty
the
queen
the
remission
of
the
subsidy
of
million
florins
which
the
town
as
i
testify
is
unable
to
pay
my
friend
benedict
turpin
will
i
know
avenge
me
frederic
baron
von
bülow
benedict
had
just
time
to
read
this
when
he
turned
at
a
cry
behind
him
it
was
from
the
poor
widow
benedict
leaving
emma
in
her
mother
care
went
to
his
room
and
wrote
four
notes
each
in
these
terms
baron
frederic
von
bülow
has
just
shot
himself
in
consequence
of
the
insult
offered
him
by
general
sturm
who
has
refused
to
give
him
satisfaction
his
body
lies
in
the
house
of
the
chandroz
family
and
his
friends
are
invited
to
pay
their
last
respects
there
his
executor
benedict
turpin
you
are
asked
to
make
the
news
of
his
death
known
as
widely
and
publicly
as
possible
having
signed
them
he
sent
them
by
hans
to
four
of
frederic
most
intimate
friends
then
he
went
down
to
general
sturm
rooms
and
sent
in
his
name
the
name
benedict
turpin
was
entirely
unknown
to
general
sturm
he
had
with
him
the
officers
who
had
witnessed
the
quarrel
with
frederic
and
at
once
said
ask
him
to
come
in
although
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
the
general
face
plainly
showed
traces
of
furious
passion
benedict
came
in
sir
he
said
probably
you
are
ignorant
of
the
sequel
to
the
occurrence
between
you
and
my
friend
frederic
von
bülow
the
incident
which
led
to
your
insult
i
have
to
inform
you
that
my
friend
since
you
refused
to
give
him
satisfaction
has
blown
out
his
brains
the
general
started
in
spite
of
himself
the
officers
dismayed
looked
at
each
other
my
friend
last
wishes
are
recorded
on
this
piece
of
paper
i
will
read
them
the
general
seized
with
nervous
tremor
sat
down
benedict
read
speaking
courteously
and
calmly
struck
in
the
face
by
general
sturm
who
has
refused
to
give
me
satisfaction
i
could
not
live
dishonoured
you
hear
me
sir
benedict
asked
the
general
made
a
sign
of
assent
my
last
wish
is
that
my
wife
in
her
widow
dress
should
leave
this
evening
for
berlin
and
there
beg
from
her
majesty
the
queen
the
remission
of
the
subsidy
of
million
florins
which
the
town
as
i
testify
is
unable
to
pay
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
sir
added
benedict
that
i
am
going
to
conduct
madame
von
bülow
to
berlin
general
sturm
got
up
one
moment
said
benedict
there
is
a
final
line
to
read
and
you
will
see
it
is
of
some
importance
my
friend
benedict
turpin
will
i
know
avenge
me
which
means
sir
said
the
general
while
the
officers
stood
breathlessly
by
which
means
that
you
shall
hear
from
me
immediately
respecting
the
time
and
place
and
weapons
for
i
mean
to
kill
you
and
so
avenge
frederic
von
bülow
and
benedict
saluting
first
the
general
and
then
the
young
officers
left
the
room
before
they
had
recovered
from
their
surprise
when
he
gained
the
other
room
emma
who
had
read
her
husband
last
words
was
already
making
her
preparations
for
her
journey
to
berlin
chapter
xxxi
the
burgomaster
two
things
had
principally
struck
sturm
in
frederic
short
will
first
the
legacy
to
benedict
of
vengeance
but
we
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
this
was
a
minor
consideration
there
is
an
unfortunate
error
amongst
military
men
that
courage
is
only
to
be
found
under
a
uniform
and
that
one
must
have
seen
death
at
close
quarters
in
order
not
to
fear
it
now
we
know
that
benedict
in
this
respect
was
on
a
level
with
the
bravest
soldier
under
whatever
aspect
he
encountered
death
whether
it
might
be
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
by
the
talons
of
a
tiger
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
or
the
poisonous
fang
of
a
serpent
still
it
was
death
the
farewell
to
sunshine
life
love
to
all
that
is
glorious
and
all
that
makes
the
breast
beat
high
and
in
its
place
that
dark
mystery
which
we
call
the
grave
but
sturm
did
not
recognize
the
threat
of
death
for
he
was
protected
by
his
individual
temperament
and
character
from
perceiving
it
he
could
only
recognize
an
actual
menace
accompanied
by
shouts
gesticulations
threats
and
oaths
and
benedict
extreme
politeness
gave
him
no
idea
of
serious
danger
he
supposed
as
all
vulgarians
do
that
any
one
who
goes
duelling
with
the
courtesy
of
the
ordinary
forms
of
life
is
arming
at
preserving
by
his
politeness
a
means
of
retreat
therefore
frederic
legacy
to
benedict
troubled
him
little
but
it
was
also
prescribed
that
madame
von
bülow
should
start
for
berlin
to
beg
of
the
queen
the
remission
of
the
fine
imposed
upon
frankfort
he
decided
to
see
general
von
roeder
without
a
moment
delay
and
tell
him
what
had
occurred
he
found
roeder
furious
at
the
senate
decision
after
listening
to
sturm
he
determined
to
have
recourse
again
to
his
old
tactics
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
to
herren
fellner
and
müller
burgomasters
of
frankfort
and
government
administrators
i
have
to
request
you
to
supply
me
by
ten
morning
with
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
members
of
the
senate
of
the
permanent
house
of
representation
and
of
the
legislative
assembly
owners
being
identified
as
such
von
roeder
scales
for
weighing
gold
are
waiting
at
general
von
address
an
answer
to
this
despatch
is
requested
then
he
directed
an
orderly
to
deliver
the
document
to
fellner
as
the
senior
burgomaster
fellner
was
not
at
home
he
had
just
received
benedict
sad
tidings
and
being
one
of
frederic
most
intimate
friends
had
hastened
to
the
chandroz
house
telling
the
news
to
all
whom
he
met
on
the
way
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
relate
the
fact
of
frederic
death
burst
upon
the
town
and
its
leading
citizens
scarcely
able
to
credit
it
flocked
to
the
room
where
his
body
lay
fellner
was
astonished
at
not
seeing
emma
heard
that
she
had
gone
to
berlin
and
was
asking
the
cause
of
this
incomprehensible
step
when
councillor
kugler
burst
in
general
roeder
letter
in
his
hand
fellner
opened
it
at
once
read
it
meditated
and
approaching
the
bier
gazed
at
his
dead
friend
after
a
few
seconds
of
contemplation
he
stooped
kissed
the
forehead
and
murmured
it
is
not
only
the
soldier
who
knows
how
to
die
then
he
slowly
left
the
house
crossed
the
town
with
bent
head
reached
the
house
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
supper
time
came
supper
is
an
important
meal
in
germany
it
is
the
cheerful
repast
at
which
in
commercial
towns
especially
the
head
of
the
family
has
time
to
enjoy
the
society
of
his
wife
and
children
for
dinner
at
two
is
only
an
interval
hastily
snatched
in
business
hours
but
by
eight
business
people
have
thrown
off
their
harness
the
hour
of
domestic
pleasure
has
come
before
refreshing
sleep
descends
to
prepare
men
for
another
day
there
is
an
interval
in
which
to
enjoy
all
that
they
hold
dear
within
the
four
walls
of
home
nothing
of
the
sort
was
possible
on
this
evening
of
july
at
the
fellners
the
burgomaster
showed
perhaps
even
more
than
his
customary
fondness
for
his
children
but
it
was
touched
with
melancholy
his
wife
whose
gaze
never
left
him
was
unable
to
speak
a
word
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
the
elder
children
observing
their
mother
sadness
sat
silent
and
the
little
ones
voices
like
the
chirping
of
birds
drew
for
the
first
time
no
smiling
response
from
their
parents
herr
von
kugler
was
mournful
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
act
promptly
and
vigorously
without
deviating
from
the
straight
course
of
honour
no
doubt
he
had
already
said
to
himself
were
i
in
his
place
this
is
what
i
should
do
supper
dragged
on
all
seemed
reluctant
to
rise
from
the
table
the
children
had
dropped
asleep
no
summons
having
come
from
the
nurse
at
last
mina
the
eldest
girl
went
to
the
piano
to
close
it
for
the
night
and
unconsciously
touched
the
keys
the
burgomaster
shivered
come
mina
he
said
play
weber
thought
you
know
it
my
favourite
mina
began
to
play
and
the
pure
melancholy
notes
poured
forth
like
golden
beads
dropped
on
a
salver
of
crystal
the
burgomaster
propped
his
bowed
head
in
his
hands
as
he
listened
to
that
sweet
poetic
melody
the
final
note
of
which
expired
like
the
last
sigh
of
an
angel
exiled
to
earth
fellner
rose
and
kissed
the
girl
she
exclaimed
in
alarm
what
is
the
matter
with
you
father
you
are
crying
i
said
fellner
quickly
what
nonsense
my
child
and
he
tried
to
smile
oh
murmured
mina
you
can
say
what
you
like
father
but
i
felt
a
tear
and
see
she
added
my
cheek
is
wet
fellner
put
a
hand
on
her
mouth
mina
kissed
it
at
this
the
father
nearly
gave
way
but
kugler
murmured
in
his
ear
be
a
man
fellner
he
grasped
his
hand
eleven
struck
never
except
for
a
dance
or
evening
party
had
the
family
sat
up
so
late
fellner
kissed
his
wife
and
the
children
but
surely
you
are
not
going
out
said
madame
fellner
no
my
dear
your
kiss
was
like
a
goodbye
goodbye
for
a
little
while
said
the
burgomaster
trying
to
smile
do
be
uneasy
i
am
going
to
work
with
your
brother
that
is
all
madame
fellner
looked
at
her
brother
and
he
gave
a
sign
of
assent
her
husband
took
her
to
her
door
go
to
sleep
dear
one
he
said
we
have
much
work
before
us
that
must
be
done
before
morning
she
stood
where
she
was
until
she
had
seen
him
enter
her
brother
room
madame
fellner
spent
the
night
in
prayer
this
simple
woman
whose
only
eloquence
was
to
say
i
love
you
found
words
to
implore
god
for
her
husband
she
prayed
so
long
and
ardently
that
at
length
sleep
came
to
her
where
she
knelt
for
great
was
her
need
of
it
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
first
light
of
the
dawn
was
filtering
through
the
window
blinds
everything
seems
strange
fantastic
at
such
an
hour
it
is
neither
night
nor
day
and
nothing
looks
as
it
does
at
any
other
time
she
gazed
around
she
felt
weak
and
chilly
and
afraid
she
glanced
at
the
bed
her
husband
was
not
there
she
rose
but
everything
danced
before
her
eyes
is
it
possible
she
thought
that
sleep
overtook
him
also
while
he
worked
i
must
go
to
him
and
groping
her
way
through
the
passages
which
were
darker
than
her
own
room
she
reached
his
she
knocked
on
the
door
there
was
no
answer
she
knocked
louder
but
all
was
silent
a
third
time
she
knocked
and
called
her
husband
name
then
trembling
with
anguish
under
a
premonition
of
the
sight
that
awaited
her
she
pushed
open
the
door
between
her
and
the
window
black
against
the
sun
first
rays
hung
her
husband
body
suspended
above
an
overturned
chair
chapter
xxxii
queen
augusta
all
through
the
night
that
was
so
sorrowful
for
the
fellner
family
the
baroness
von
bülow
was
travelling
rapidly
to
berlin
where
she
arrived
about
eight
in
the
morning
in
any
other
circumstances
she
would
have
written
to
the
queen
asked
for
an
audience
and
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
of
etiquette
but
there
was
no
time
to
lose
general
von
roeder
had
allowed
only
hours
for
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
it
was
due
at
ten
and
in
case
of
refusal
the
city
was
threatened
with
immediate
pillage
and
bombardment
notices
at
the
corners
of
all
the
streets
proclaimed
that
at
ten
on
the
morrow
the
general
with
his
staff
would
be
waiting
in
the
old
senate
hall
to
receive
the
levy
there
was
indeed
not
a
moment
to
lose
on
leaving
the
train
therefore
madame
von
bülow
took
a
cab
and
drove
straight
to
the
little
palace
where
the
queen
had
been
living
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
madame
von
bülow
asked
for
the
chamberlain
waals
who
as
has
been
said
already
was
a
friend
of
her
husband
he
came
instantly
and
seeing
her
dressed
all
in
black
cried
out
good
god
has
frederic
been
killed
he
has
not
been
killed
my
dear
count
he
has
killed
himself
answered
the
baroness
and
i
want
to
see
the
queen
without
a
delay
the
chamberlain
made
no
objections
he
knew
how
highly
the
king
valued
frederic
he
knew
also
that
the
queen
was
acquainted
with
his
widow
he
hastened
to
go
and
beg
the
desired
audience
queen
augusta
is
known
throughout
germany
for
her
extreme
kindness
and
her
distinguished
intelligence
no
sooner
had
she
heard
from
her
chamberlain
that
emma
had
come
dressed
in
mourning
probably
to
implore
some
favour
than
she
exclaimed
bring
her
in
bring
her
in
madame
von
bülow
was
immediately
summoned
and
as
she
left
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
waiting
she
saw
the
door
of
the
royal
apartments
open
and
queen
augusta
waiting
for
her
in
the
doorway
without
advancing
another
step
the
baroness
bent
one
knee
to
the
ground
she
tried
to
speak
but
the
only
words
that
escaped
her
lips
were
oh
your
majesty
the
queen
came
to
her
and
raised
her
up
what
do
you
want
my
dear
baroness
she
asked
what
brings
you
and
why
are
you
in
mourning
i
am
in
mourning
your
majesty
for
a
man
and
for
a
city
very
dear
to
me
for
my
husband
who
is
dead
and
for
my
native
city
which
is
at
death
door
your
husband
is
dead
poor
child
waals
told
me
so
and
he
added
that
he
had
killed
himself
what
can
have
driven
him
to
such
a
deed
some
injustice
must
have
been
done
him
speak
and
we
will
redress
it
it
is
not
that
which
brings
me
madam
i
am
not
the
person
to
whom
my
husband
has
left
the
duty
of
avenging
him
in
that
respect
i
need
only
leave
god
will
and
his
to
take
their
course
what
brings
me
madam
is
the
despair
of
my
city
upon
whose
ruin
your
armies
or
rather
your
generals
seem
to
be
resolved
come
my
child
and
tell
me
about
it
said
the
queen
she
led
emma
into
her
and
seated
herself
beside
her
but
emma
slipped
from
the
sofa
and
knelt
once
more
before
the
queen
madam
you
know
the
city
of
frankfort
i
was
there
last
year
said
the
queen
and
had
the
kindest
possible
reception
may
the
remembrance
of
it
help
my
words
general
falkenstein
when
he
came
to
our
city
began
by
laying
upon
it
a
tax
of
seven
million
florins
that
levy
was
paid
together
with
one
about
equally
heavy
in
kind
that
made
fourteen
millions
already
for
a
small
town
of
thousand
inhabitants
half
of
whom
were
foreigners
and
consequently
did
not
contribute
to
the
payment
and
did
frankfort
pay
it
asked
the
queen
frankfort
paid
it
madam
for
that
was
still
possible
but
general
manteuffel
arrived
and
put
on
a
tax
in
his
turn
of
million
florins
such
a
tax
if
imposed
upon
eighteen
million
subjects
madam
would
yield
more
milliards
of
coin
than
the
whole
world
contains
well
and
at
this
very
hour
cannon
are
planted
in
the
streets
and
on
the
positions
that
command
the
town
if
the
sum
is
not
paid
at
ten
and
it
will
not
be
paid
madam
it
is
impossible
the
city
will
be
bombarded
and
given
over
to
pillage
a
neutral
unwalled
city
which
has
no
gates
which
has
not
defended
itself
and
can
not
defend
itself
and
how
comes
it
my
child
asked
the
queen
that
you
a
woman
have
taken
upon
yourself
to
ask
justice
for
this
city
it
has
a
council
it
has
one
no
longer
madam
the
council
has
been
dissolved
and
two
of
the
councillors
arrested
and
the
burgomasters
they
do
not
dare
to
take
any
step
for
fear
of
being
shot
god
is
my
witness
madam
that
i
did
not
put
myself
forward
to
come
and
plead
for
that
unhappy
city
it
was
my
dying
husband
who
said
to
me
and
i
came
but
what
can
be
done
said
the
queen
your
majesty
needs
no
adviser
but
your
heart
but
i
repeat
if
by
ten
no
comes
from
the
king
frankfort
is
lost
if
only
the
king
were
here
said
the
queen
thanks
to
the
telegraph
your
majesty
knows
that
there
are
no
distances
now
a
telegram
from
your
majesty
can
receive
an
answer
in
and
in
another
that
answer
can
be
sent
to
frankfort
you
are
right
said
queen
augusta
as
she
went
towards
a
little
bureau
loaded
with
papers
she
wrote
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
prussia
berlin
sire
i
approach
you
to
entreat
humbly
and
earnestly
that
the
indemnity
of
million
florins
arbitrarily
imposed
upon
the
city
of
frankfort
which
has
already
paid
fourteen
millions
in
money
and
in
kind
may
be
withdrawn
your
very
humble
servant
and
affectionate
wife
augusta
please
reply
immediately
she
handed
the
paper
to
emma
who
read
and
returned
it
herr
von
waals
was
summoned
and
came
instantly
take
this
telegram
to
the
telegraph
office
and
wait
for
the
answer
and
you
my
child
continued
the
queen
let
us
think
about
you
you
must
be
worn
out
you
must
be
starving
oh
madam
a
second
time
the
queen
touched
her
bell
bring
my
breakfast
here
said
she
the
baroness
will
take
some
with
me
a
collation
was
brought
in
which
the
baroness
scarcely
touched
at
every
footstep
she
started
believing
it
to
be
that
of
herr
von
waals
at
length
hurried
steps
were
heard
the
door
opened
and
herr
von
waals
appeared
holding
a
telegram
in
his
hand
emma
forgetful
of
the
queen
presence
rushed
towards
him
but
paused
ashamed
oh
madam
forgive
me
said
she
no
no
replied
the
queen
take
it
and
read
it
emma
trembling
opened
the
despatch
glanced
at
it
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
it
contained
these
words
at
the
request
of
our
beloved
consort
the
indemnity
of
million
florins
levied
by
general
manteuffel
is
countermanded
william
well
said
the
queen
to
whom
should
this
despatch
be
sent
in
order
that
it
may
arrive
in
time
you
dear
child
are
the
person
who
has
obtained
this
favour
and
the
honour
of
it
ought
to
rest
with
you
you
say
it
is
important
that
the
king
decision
should
be
known
in
frankfort
by
ten
tell
me
to
what
person
it
should
be
addressed
indeed
madam
i
do
not
know
how
to
make
any
answer
to
so
much
kindness
said
the
baroness
kneeling
and
kissing
the
queen
hands
i
know
that
the
proper
person
to
whom
to
send
it
would
be
the
burgomaster
but
who
can
tell
whether
the
burgomaster
may
not
have
fled
or
be
in
prison
i
think
the
safest
way
excuse
my
egoism
madam
but
if
you
do
me
the
honour
of
consulting
me
i
would
beg
that
it
may
be
addressed
to
madame
von
beling
my
grandmother
she
very
certainly
will
not
lose
a
moment
in
putting
it
into
the
proper
hands
what
you
wish
shall
be
done
my
dear
child
said
the
queen
and
she
added
to
the
despatch
this
favour
has
been
granted
to
queen
augusta
by
her
gracious
consort
king
william
but
it
was
asked
of
the
queen
by
her
faithful
friend
baroness
frederic
von
bülow
her
principal
augusta
the
queen
raised
emma
from
her
knees
kissed
her
unfastened
from
her
own
shoulder
the
order
of
queen
louisa
and
fastened
it
on
the
shoulder
as
for
you
she
said
you
need
some
hours
rest
and
you
shall
not
go
until
you
have
taken
them
i
beg
your
majesty
pardon
replied
the
baroness
but
two
persons
are
waiting
for
me
my
husband
and
my
child
nevertheless
as
no
train
left
until
one
in
the
afternoon
and
as
the
hour
could
neither
be
hastened
nor
retarded
emma
resigned
herself
to
waiting
the
queen
gave
orders
that
she
should
receive
the
same
attentions
as
though
she
were
already
a
made
her
take
a
bath
and
some
hours
rest
and
engaged
a
carriage
for
her
in
the
train
for
frankfort
that
city
meanwhile
was
in
consternation
general
roeder
with
his
staff
was
waiting
in
the
council
hall
for
the
payment
required
scales
were
ready
for
the
weighing
at
nine
the
gunners
match
alight
and
in
hand
came
to
take
their
places
at
the
batteries
the
deepest
terror
prevailed
throughout
the
town
from
the
arrangements
which
they
saw
being
made
the
frankforters
judged
that
no
mercy
was
to
be
expected
from
the
prussian
generals
the
whole
population
was
shut
up
indoors
waiting
anxiously
for
the
stroke
of
ten
to
announce
the
town
doom
all
at
once
a
terrible
rumour
began
to
circulate
that
the
burgomaster
rather
than
denounce
his
had
ended
his
life
had
hanged
himself
at
a
few
minutes
before
ten
a
man
dressed
in
black
came
out
of
herr
fellner
house
it
was
his
herr
von
kugler
and
he
held
in
his
hand
a
rope
he
walked
straight
on
without
speaking
to
anybody
or
stopping
till
he
reached
the
roemer
pushed
aside
with
his
arm
the
sentinels
who
attempted
to
prevent
his
passing
and
entering
the
hall
in
which
general
von
roeder
was
presiding
he
advanced
to
the
scales
and
threw
into
one
of
them
the
rope
that
he
had
been
carrying
there
said
he
is
the
ransom
of
the
city
of
frankfort
what
does
this
mean
asked
general
von
roeder
this
means
that
rather
than
obey
you
burgomaster
fellner
hanged
himself
with
this
rope
may
his
death
fall
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
caused
it
but
returned
general
von
roeder
brutally
while
he
continued
to
smoke
his
cigar
the
indemnity
must
be
paid
all
the
same
unless
quietly
said
benedict
turpin
who
had
just
come
in
king
william
should
withdraw
it
from
the
city
of
frankfort
and
unfolding
the
despatch
that
madame
von
beling
had
just
received
he
read
the
whole
of
it
in
a
loud
voice
to
general
von
roeder
sir
said
he
i
advise
you
to
put
the
million
florins
into
your
profit
and
loss
account
i
have
the
honour
to
leave
you
the
despatch
as
a
voucher
chapter
xxxiii
the
two
processions
two
very
different
pieces
of
news
one
terrible
one
joyful
ran
simultaneously
through
frankfort
the
terrible
news
was
that
the
burgomaster
who
had
filled
two
of
the
highest
positions
in
the
little
republic
now
extinct
who
was
the
father
of
six
children
and
a
model
of
the
household
virtues
had
just
hanged
himself
rather
than
yield
to
a
greedy
and
brutal
soldier
the
secrets
of
private
wealth
the
joyful
news
was
that
thanks
to
madame
von
bülow
intervention
and
to
the
appeal
made
by
the
queen
to
her
husband
the
city
of
frankfort
had
been
relieved
from
the
tax
of
million
florins
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
nobody
in
the
town
talked
of
any
other
subject
astonishment
and
curiosity
were
even
more
aroused
owing
to
the
occurrence
of
two
mysterious
deaths
at
the
same
time
people
wondered
how
it
happened
that
frederic
von
bülow
after
having
been
insulted
by
his
superior
officer
should
before
he
shot
himself
have
charged
his
wife
with
her
pious
errand
to
berlin
seeing
that
he
was
no
citizen
of
frankfort
but
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
prussian
army
had
he
hoped
to
redeem
the
terrible
deeds
of
violence
committed
by
his
countrymen
moreover
the
young
officers
who
had
been
present
at
the
quarrel
between
frederic
and
the
general
had
not
observed
entire
silence
about
that
quarrel
many
of
them
were
hurt
in
their
pride
at
being
employed
to
execute
a
vengeance
of
which
the
cause
lay
far
back
amid
the
obscure
resentments
of
a
minister
who
had
once
been
an
ambassador
those
who
felt
this
said
among
themselves
that
they
were
acting
the
part
not
of
soldiers
but
of
bailiffs
and
they
had
repeated
some
words
of
the
dispute
that
had
taken
place
before
them
and
had
left
the
rest
to
be
guessed
orders
had
been
given
prohibiting
the
printing
of
any
placard
without
the
authorization
of
the
officer
in
command
but
every
printer
in
frankfort
was
ready
to
contravene
the
order
and
at
the
very
moment
when
councillor
kugler
threw
the
burgomaster
rope
into
the
scale
a
thousand
unseen
and
unknown
hands
were
pasting
upon
the
walls
of
frankfort
the
following
notice
at
three
our
worthy
burgomaster
fellner
hanged
himself
and
became
the
martyr
of
his
devotion
to
the
city
of
frankfort
citizens
pray
for
him
benedict
on
his
part
had
visited
the
printer
of
the
journal
des
postes
who
engaged
to
furnish
within
two
hours
two
hundred
copies
of
the
telegrams
interchanged
by
the
king
and
queen
he
further
undertook
on
condition
that
the
notices
were
not
unduly
large
to
get
them
posted
by
his
usual
billstickers
who
were
ready
to
take
the
risk
of
officially
announcing
the
good
news
to
their
neighbours
accordingly
two
hours
later
two
hundred
bills
were
stuck
beside
the
former
ones
they
contained
the
following
words
yesterday
at
two
in
the
afternoon
as
is
already
known
baron
von
bülow
blew
out
his
brains
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
with
general
sturm
in
the
course
of
which
the
general
had
insulted
him
the
causes
of
this
quarrel
will
remain
a
secret
for
such
people
only
as
do
not
care
to
solve
it
one
clause
of
the
baron
will
instructed
madame
von
bülow
to
go
to
berlin
and
to
beg
of
her
majesty
queen
augusta
that
the
levy
of
million
florins
imposed
by
general
manteuffel
might
be
withdrawn
the
baroness
paused
only
long
enough
to
put
on
mourning
garments
before
setting
out
we
are
happy
to
be
able
to
communicate
to
our
the
two
royal
despatches
which
she
sent
to
us
the
crowds
that
collected
before
these
notices
can
be
imagined
for
one
moment
the
stir
that
passed
through
the
whole
population
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
riot
drums
beat
patrols
were
organized
and
the
citizens
received
an
order
to
stay
at
home
the
streets
became
deserted
the
gunners
whose
matches
as
we
have
said
already
had
been
lighted
at
ten
in
the
morning
once
more
stood
by
their
cannon
with
their
lighted
matches
in
hand
this
sort
of
threat
continued
for
thirty
hours
however
as
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
crowds
were
no
longer
collecting
as
no
conflicts
took
place
and
no
shot
was
fired
all
these
hostile
demonstrations
ceased
between
the
and
the
next
morning
fresh
placards
had
been
stuck
up
they
contained
the
following
notice
july
at
two
in
the
afternoon
the
funerals
will
take
place
of
the
late
burgomaster
herr
fellner
and
of
the
late
chief
staff
officer
frederic
von
bülow
each
party
will
start
from
the
house
of
mourning
and
the
two
will
unite
at
the
cathedral
where
a
service
will
be
held
for
the
two
martyrs
the
families
believe
that
no
invitation
beyond
the
present
notice
will
be
necessary
and
that
the
citizens
of
frankfort
will
not
fail
in
their
duty
the
funeral
arrangements
for
the
burgomaster
will
be
in
the
hands
of
his
councillor
kugler
and
those
of
major
frederic
von
bülow
in
the
hands
of
benedict
turpin
his
executor
we
will
not
endeavour
to
depict
the
homes
of
the
two
bereaved
families
madame
von
bülow
arrived
about
one
on
the
morning
of
the
everybody
in
the
house
was
up
and
all
were
praying
round
the
deathbed
some
of
the
principal
ladies
of
the
town
had
come
and
were
awaiting
her
return
she
was
received
like
an
angel
bearing
the
mercies
of
heaven
but
after
a
few
minutes
the
pious
duty
that
had
brought
her
so
swiftly
to
her
husband
side
was
remembered
everybody
withdrew
and
she
was
left
alone
helen
in
her
turn
was
watching
by
karl
twice
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
had
gone
downstairs
knelt
by
frederic
bedside
uttered
a
prayer
kissed
his
forehead
and
gone
up
again
karl
was
better
he
had
not
yet
returned
to
life
but
he
was
returning
his
eyes
reopened
and
were
able
to
fix
themselves
upon
helen
his
mouth
murmured
words
of
love
and
his
hand
responded
to
the
hand
that
pressed
it
the
surgeon
only
still
remained
anxious
and
while
encouraging
the
wounded
man
would
give
helen
no
reply
but
when
he
was
alone
with
her
would
only
repeat
in
answer
to
all
her
questions
we
must
wait
i
can
say
nothing
before
the
eighth
or
ninth
day
the
house
of
herr
fellner
was
equally
full
of
mourning
everybody
who
had
filled
any
post
in
the
old
republic
senators
members
of
the
legislative
assembly
came
to
salute
this
dead
and
just
man
and
to
lay
on
his
bed
wreaths
of
oak
of
laurel
and
from
early
in
the
morning
of
the
as
soon
as
the
cannon
were
perceived
to
have
disappeared
and
the
town
to
be
no
longer
threatened
with
slaughter
at
any
unexpected
moment
all
the
inhabitants
congregated
about
the
two
doors
that
were
hung
with
black
at
ten
all
the
trade
guilds
met
together
in
the
zeil
with
their
banners
as
if
for
some
popular
festivity
of
the
free
town
all
the
dissolved
societies
of
the
city
came
with
flags
flying
although
they
had
been
forbidden
to
display
these
ensigns
determined
to
live
again
for
one
more
day
there
was
the
society
of
carabineers
the
gymnastic
society
the
national
defence
society
the
new
citizens
society
the
young
militia
society
the
sachsenhausen
citizens
society
and
the
society
for
the
education
of
the
workers
black
flags
had
been
hung
out
at
a
great
number
of
houses
among
others
at
the
casino
in
the
street
of
saint
gall
which
belonged
to
the
principal
inhabitants
of
frankfort
at
the
club
of
the
new
citizens
union
situated
in
the
corn
market
at
that
of
the
old
citizens
union
in
eschenheim
street
and
finally
at
the
sachsenhausen
club
a
club
of
the
people
if
there
ever
was
one
belonging
to
the
inhabitants
of
that
often
mentioned
suburb
a
gathering
almost
as
considerable
was
collecting
at
the
corner
of
the
horse
market
near
to
the
high
street
here
it
may
be
remembered
the
house
was
situated
which
was
generally
known
in
the
town
as
the
chandroz
house
although
nobody
of
that
name
now
existed
in
it
except
helen
whose
maiden
name
had
not
yet
been
changed
for
that
of
a
husband
but
in
the
street
that
led
to
the
burgomaster
house
the
middle
and
were
assembled
while
opposite
to
the
chandroz
house
the
crowd
was
made
up
mainly
of
that
aristocracy
of
birth
to
which
the
house
belonged
the
strangest
feature
of
this
second
crowd
was
the
number
of
prussian
officers
who
had
assembled
to
render
the
last
honour
to
their
comrade
at
the
risk
of
displeasing
their
superiors
generals
roeder
and
sturm
these
latter
had
had
the
good
sense
to
leave
frankfort
without
making
any
attempt
whatever
to
suppress
the
display
of
public
feeling
when
councillor
kugler
emerged
from
the
burgomaster
house
following
the
coffin
and
holding
the
dead
man
two
sons
by
the
hand
cries
of
hurrah
for
madame
fellner
hurrah
for
madame
fellner
and
her
children
rang
out
in
expression
to
her
of
the
gratitude
felt
to
her
husband
she
understood
this
outburst
rising
to
her
from
so
many
hearts
at
once
and
when
she
appeared
dressed
in
black
upon
the
balcony
with
her
four
daughters
dressed
likewise
in
black
sobs
broke
forth
and
tears
flowed
from
every
eye
the
same
thing
happened
as
frederic
coffin
began
its
journey
it
was
to
frederic
widow
that
frankfort
owed
its
escape
from
ruin
the
cry
of
hurrah
for
madame
von
bülow
rose
from
hundreds
of
throats
and
was
repeated
until
the
fair
young
widow
wrapped
in
her
draperies
of
black
crape
came
forward
to
accept
the
expression
of
gratitude
offered
her
by
the
whole
town
although
the
officers
had
received
no
order
to
attend
funeral
although
neither
the
drummers
who
usually
precede
the
coffin
of
a
superior
officer
nor
the
soldiers
who
usually
follow
it
had
been
commanded
to
do
so
yet
either
from
their
military
training
or
their
sympathy
for
the
dead
man
the
drummers
were
present
and
so
was
the
escort
of
soldiers
when
the
procession
started
and
it
advanced
towards
the
cathedral
to
the
sound
of
muffled
drums
at
the
agreed
point
the
two
processions
united
and
went
forward
side
by
side
occupying
the
whole
width
of
the
street
only
like
two
rivers
which
run
parallel
but
of
which
the
waters
do
not
mingle
the
leaders
of
the
two
parties
walked
forward
behind
the
burgomaster
hearse
followed
the
burghers
and
the
populace
behind
that
of
baron
von
bülow
the
aristocracy
and
the
military
for
the
moment
peace
appeared
to
have
been
made
between
these
two
populations
one
of
which
weighed
so
cruelly
upon
the
other
that
only
the
death
of
a
man
universally
esteemed
could
hold
them
together
for
a
few
instants
leaving
them
to
fall
asunder
immediately
afterwards
into
mutual
hostility
at
the
great
door
of
the
cathedral
the
coffins
were
lifted
from
the
hearses
and
laid
side
by
side
thence
they
were
borne
into
the
choir
but
the
church
had
been
so
filled
since
early
morning
by
a
crowd
eager
as
the
dwellers
in
large
towns
always
are
for
a
spectacle
that
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
two
coffins
to
pass
to
the
nave
the
military
escort
the
drums
and
the
company
of
soldiers
followed
them
but
when
the
crowd
that
accompanied
the
coffins
tried
to
enter
and
find
a
place
in
the
building
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
and
more
than
three
thousand
persons
were
left
in
the
porch
and
in
the
street
the
ceremony
began
solemn
and
lugubrious
accompanied
by
the
occasional
roll
of
drums
and
the
sound
of
gun
stocks
touching
the
ground
no
one
could
have
said
to
which
of
the
dead
these
military
honours
were
being
paid
so
that
the
unfortunate
burgomaster
had
his
share
in
the
funeral
honours
bestowed
by
the
very
body
of
men
who
had
caused
his
death
it
is
true
that
from
time
to
time
the
choral
society
sang
funeral
hymns
and
that
the
voices
of
the
congregation
rising
like
a
wave
stifled
these
other
sounds
the
service
was
long
and
although
it
lacked
the
impressive
roman
catholic
pomp
it
did
not
fail
to
produce
an
immense
effect
upon
those
who
were
present
then
the
two
processions
set
out
for
the
cemetery
the
burgomaster
attended
by
funeral
chants
the
officer
by
martial
music
the
vault
of
the
chandroz
family
and
that
of
the
burgomaster
were
at
a
distance
from
each
other
so
that
the
two
parties
separated
at
the
grave
of
the
civilian
there
were
hymns
speeches
and
wreaths
of
at
that
of
the
officer
firing
and
wreaths
of
laurel
the
double
ceremonies
were
not
entirely
concluded
until
the
evening
nor
did
the
gloomy
and
silent
crowd
return
until
then
into
its
usual
channels
while
the
drummers
privates
and
officers
went
to
their
quarters
if
not
like
a
hostile
troop
at
least
like
a
body
altogether
apart
from
the
inhabitants
benedict
had
had
in
his
mind
throughout
the
ceremony
the
idea
of
presenting
himself
on
the
morrow
to
general
sturm
in
the
character
of
frederic
executor
and
as
such
demanding
satisfaction
for
the
insult
offered
to
his
friend
but
when
he
returned
to
the
house
he
found
emma
so
overcome
karl
so
weak
and
the
old
baroness
von
beling
so
exhausted
by
age
and
woe
together
as
to
make
him
think
that
the
unhappy
chandroz
family
still
needed
him
now
in
such
a
duel
as
that
which
he
meant
to
propose
to
general
sturm
one
of
the
results
must
inevitably
ensue
either
he
would
kill
the
general
or
the
general
would
kill
him
if
he
killed
the
general
he
would
clearly
have
to
leave
frankfort
that
very
moment
in
order
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
the
prussians
if
he
were
killed
he
would
become
completely
useless
to
the
family
which
seemed
in
need
even
more
of
his
moral
protection
than
of
his
material
support
he
determined
therefore
to
wait
for
some
days
but
promised
himself
to
send
his
card
daily
to
general
sturm
and
he
kept
his
word
general
sturm
could
thus
be
sure
every
morning
that
though
he
might
forget
benedict
benedict
did
not
forget
him
chapter
xxxiv
the
transfusion
of
blood
three
days
had
elapsed
since
the
events
just
narrated
the
first
bursts
of
grief
in
the
two
bereaved
households
were
appeased
and
though
there
were
still
tears
there
were
no
longer
sobs
karl
grew
better
and
better
for
two
days
past
he
had
raised
himself
in
his
bed
and
had
been
able
to
give
signs
of
consciousness
not
only
by
broken
utterances
tender
exclamations
and
endearing
words
but
by
taking
part
in
conversation
his
brain
which
like
the
rest
of
his
body
had
been
greatly
enfeebled
was
gradually
recovering
the
supremacy
which
it
exercises
over
the
rest
of
the
body
in
health
helen
who
beheld
this
resurrection
and
was
at
the
age
when
youth
gives
one
hand
to
love
and
one
to
hope
rejoiced
in
this
visible
recovery
as
though
heaven
itself
had
promised
that
no
accident
should
come
to
disturb
it
twice
a
day
the
surgeon
visited
the
wounded
man
and
without
destroying
helen
hopes
he
persisted
in
withholding
any
assurance
of
complete
safety
karl
saw
her
hope
but
he
remarked
too
the
reserve
with
which
the
surgeon
received
all
her
joyful
schemes
for
the
future
he
also
was
making
schemes
but
of
a
sadder
kind
helen
said
he
i
know
all
you
have
done
for
me
benedict
has
told
me
of
your
tears
your
despair
your
weariness
i
love
you
with
so
selfish
a
love
helen
that
i
wish
before
i
die
and
as
helen
made
a
movement
he
added
if
i
die
i
wish
first
to
call
you
my
wife
so
that
in
case
there
exists
as
they
tell
us
and
as
our
own
pride
leads
us
to
believe
a
world
beyond
this
i
may
find
my
wife
there
as
here
promise
me
then
my
sweet
nurse
that
if
any
one
of
those
accidents
that
trouble
the
doctor
mind
should
occur
promise
me
that
you
will
instantly
send
for
a
priest
and
with
your
hand
in
mine
say
us
your
blessing
father
karl
von
freyberg
is
my
husband
and
i
swear
to
you
helen
that
my
death
will
be
as
easy
and
calm
then
as
it
would
be
full
of
despair
if
i
could
not
say
my
beloved
wife
helen
listened
with
that
smile
of
hope
upon
her
lips
with
which
she
made
answer
to
all
karl
words
whether
sad
or
happy
from
time
to
time
when
she
saw
her
patient
becoming
excited
she
would
sign
to
him
to
be
still
and
taking
down
from
her
bookshelves
uhland
or
goethe
or
schiller
would
read
aloud
to
him
and
almost
always
karl
would
close
his
eyes
and
presently
fall
asleep
to
the
sound
of
her
melodious
liquid
voice
his
need
of
sleep
after
so
great
a
loss
of
blood
was
enormous
and
then
as
though
she
could
see
the
shadows
thickening
over
his
brain
she
would
let
her
voice
grow
dim
little
by
little
and
with
her
eyes
half
upon
the
sick
man
and
half
upon
her
page
would
cease
to
speak
at
the
very
moment
when
he
began
to
sleep
at
night
she
allowed
benedict
to
take
her
place
by
karl
for
two
or
three
hours
because
karl
entreated
it
but
she
did
not
go
out
of
the
room
a
curtain
was
drawn
across
the
recess
in
which
her
bed
now
brought
into
the
middle
of
the
room
for
the
patient
previously
stood
and
behind
the
curtain
she
slept
on
a
couch
slept
so
lightly
that
at
the
least
movement
in
the
room
or
the
first
word
uttered
the
curtain
would
be
lifted
and
her
voice
would
ask
anxiously
what
is
it
helen
was
a
sister
of
those
delightful
creations
that
are
to
be
found
on
every
page
of
germany
popular
poetry
we
attribute
great
merit
to
those
poetic
dreamers
who
perceive
loreleis
in
the
mist
of
the
rhine
and
mignons
in
the
foliage
of
thickets
and
do
not
remind
ourselves
that
there
is
after
all
no
such
great
merit
in
finding
these
charming
images
because
they
are
not
the
visions
of
genius
but
actual
copies
whose
originals
the
misty
nature
of
england
and
of
germany
sets
before
them
as
models
weeping
or
smiling
but
always
poetical
observe
too
that
on
the
shores
of
the
rhine
the
main
or
the
danube
it
is
not
necessary
to
seek
these
types
rare
if
not
unknown
among
ourselves
in
the
ranks
of
the
aristocracy
but
they
may
be
seen
at
the
window
or
the
peasant
doorway
where
schüler
found
his
louisa
and
goethe
his
margaret
thus
helen
accomplished
deeds
that
seem
to
us
the
height
of
devotion
with
the
most
entire
simplicity
and
never
knew
that
her
loving
toil
deserved
a
glance
of
approval
from
man
or
even
from
god
on
the
nights
when
helen
sat
up
benedict
rested
in
frederic
room
throwing
himself
fully
dressed
upon
the
bed
so
as
to
be
ready
at
the
first
call
to
run
to
helen
assistance
or
to
go
for
the
surgeon
we
have
already
said
that
a
carriage
ready
harnessed
was
always
at
the
door
and
oddly
enough
the
further
recovery
progressed
the
more
the
doctor
insisted
that
this
precaution
should
not
be
neglected
july
had
been
reached
when
after
having
watched
by
karl
during
a
part
of
the
night
benedict
had
yielded
his
post
to
helen
had
returned
to
frederic
room
and
flung
himself
upon
the
bed
when
all
at
once
he
thought
he
heard
himself
loudly
called
almost
at
the
same
moment
his
door
opened
and
helen
pale
dishevelled
and
covered
with
blood
appeared
in
the
doorway
making
inarticulate
sounds
that
seemed
to
stand
for
help
benedict
guessed
what
had
happened
the
doctor
less
reserved
towards
him
than
towards
the
young
girl
had
told
him
what
possibilities
he
feared
and
evidently
one
of
these
possibilities
had
come
to
pass
he
rushed
to
karl
room
the
ligature
of
the
artery
had
burst
and
blood
was
flowing
in
waves
and
in
jets
karl
had
fainted
benedict
did
not
lose
an
instant
twisting
his
handkerchief
into
a
rope
he
tied
it
round
karl
upper
arm
broke
the
bar
of
a
chair
with
a
kick
slipped
the
bar
into
the
knot
of
the
handkerchief
and
turning
the
stick
upon
its
axis
made
what
is
known
in
medical
language
as
a
the
blood
stopped
instantly
helen
flung
herself
distractedly
upon
the
bed
she
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
she
did
not
hear
benedict
calling
to
her
the
doctor
the
doctor
with
his
free
hand
the
other
was
pressing
upon
karl
arm
benedict
pulled
the
bell
so
violently
that
hans
guessing
something
unusual
to
be
the
matter
arrived
quite
scared
take
the
carriage
and
fetch
the
doctor
cried
benedict
hans
understood
everything
for
in
one
glance
he
had
seen
all
he
flung
himself
downstairs
and
into
the
carriage
calling
out
in
his
turn
to
the
doctor
as
it
was
scarcely
six
in
the
morning
the
doctor
was
at
home
and
within
ten
minutes
walked
into
the
room
seeing
the
blood
streaming
over
the
floor
helen
half
fainting
and
above
all
benedict
compressing
the
wounded
man
arm
he
understood
what
had
happened
the
rather
that
he
had
dreaded
this
ah
i
foresaw
this
he
exclaimed
a
secondary
hæmorrhage
the
artery
has
given
way
at
his
voice
helen
sprang
up
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
he
will
not
die
he
will
not
die
she
cried
you
will
not
let
him
die
will
you
the
doctor
disengaged
himself
from
her
grasp
and
approached
the
bed
karl
had
not
lost
nearly
so
much
blood
as
last
time
but
to
judge
from
the
pool
that
was
spreading
across
the
room
he
must
have
lost
over
ounces
which
in
his
present
state
of
weakness
was
exorbitant
however
the
doctor
did
not
lose
courage
the
arm
was
still
bare
he
made
a
fresh
incision
and
sought
with
his
forceps
for
the
artery
which
fortunately
having
been
compressed
by
benedict
had
moved
only
a
few
centimetres
in
a
second
the
artery
was
tied
but
the
wounded
man
was
completely
unconscious
helen
who
had
watched
the
first
operation
with
anxiety
followed
this
one
with
terror
she
had
then
seen
karl
lying
mute
motionless
and
cold
with
the
appearance
of
death
but
she
had
not
seem
him
pass
as
he
had
just
done
from
life
to
death
his
lips
were
white
his
eyes
closed
his
cheeks
waxen
clearly
karl
had
gone
nearer
to
the
grave
than
even
on
the
former
occasion
helen
wrung
her
hands
oh
his
wish
his
wish
she
cried
he
will
not
have
the
joy
of
seeing
it
fulfilled
sir
she
said
to
the
doctor
will
he
not
reopen
his
eyes
will
he
not
speak
again
before
he
dies
i
do
not
ask
for
his
life
only
a
miracle
could
grant
that
but
make
him
open
his
eyes
doctor
doctor
make
him
speak
to
me
let
a
priest
join
our
hands
let
us
be
united
in
this
world
so
that
we
may
not
be
separated
in
the
next
the
doctor
despite
his
usual
calm
could
not
remain
cold
in
the
presence
of
such
sorrow
though
he
had
done
all
that
was
in
the
power
of
his
art
and
felt
that
he
could
do
no
more
he
tried
to
reassure
helen
with
those
commonplaces
that
physicians
keep
in
reserve
for
the
last
extremities
but
benedict
going
up
to
him
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
doctor
you
hear
what
she
asks
she
does
not
ask
for
her
lover
life
she
asks
for
a
few
moments
revival
long
enough
for
the
priest
to
utter
a
few
words
and
place
a
ring
upon
her
finger
yes
yes
cried
helen
only
that
senseless
that
i
was
not
to
have
yielded
when
he
asked
and
sent
at
once
for
the
priest
let
him
open
his
eyes
let
him
say
so
that
his
wish
may
be
accomplished
and
i
may
keep
my
promise
to
him
doctor
said
benedict
pressing
the
hand
which
he
had
retained
in
his
how
if
we
asked
from
science
the
miracle
that
heaven
seems
to
deny
how
if
we
were
to
try
transfusion
of
blood
what
is
that
asked
helen
the
doctor
considered
for
a
second
and
looked
at
the
patient
then
he
said
there
is
no
hope
we
risk
nothing
i
asked
you
said
helen
what
is
transfusion
of
blood
it
consists
replied
the
doctor
in
passing
into
the
exhausted
veins
of
a
sick
man
enough
warm
living
blood
to
give
him
back
if
only
for
a
moment
life
speech
and
consciousness
i
have
never
performed
the
operation
but
have
seen
it
once
or
twice
in
hospitals
so
have
i
said
benedict
i
have
always
been
interested
in
strange
things
so
i
attended
majendie
lectures
and
i
have
always
seen
the
experiment
succeed
when
the
blood
infused
belonged
to
an
animal
of
the
same
species
well
said
the
doctor
i
will
go
and
try
to
find
a
man
willing
to
sell
us
some
twenty
or
thirty
ounces
of
his
blood
doctor
said
benedict
throwing
off
his
coat
i
do
not
sell
my
blood
to
my
friends
but
i
give
it
your
man
is
here
at
these
words
helen
uttered
a
cry
flung
herself
violently
between
benedict
and
the
doctor
and
proudly
holding
out
her
bare
arm
to
the
surgeon
said
to
benedict
you
have
done
enough
for
him
already
if
human
blood
is
to
pass
from
another
into
the
veins
of
my
beloved
karl
it
shall
be
mine
it
is
my
right
benedict
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
skirt
the
less
impressionable
doctor
merely
said
very
well
we
will
try
give
the
patient
a
spoonful
of
some
cordial
i
will
go
home
and
get
the
instruments
chapter
xxxv
the
marriage
the
doctor
rushed
from
the
room
as
rapidly
as
his
professional
dignity
would
allow
during
his
absence
helen
slipped
a
spoonful
of
a
cordial
between
lips
while
benedict
rang
the
bell
hans
appeared
go
and
fetch
a
priest
said
helen
is
it
for
extreme
unction
hans
ventured
to
ask
for
a
marriage
answered
helen
five
minutes
later
the
doctor
returned
with
his
apparatus
and
asked
benedict
to
ring
for
a
servant
a
maid
came
some
warm
water
in
a
deep
vessel
said
the
doctor
and
a
thermometer
if
there
is
one
in
the
house
she
came
back
with
the
required
articles
the
doctor
took
a
bandage
from
his
pocket
and
rolled
it
round
the
wounded
man
left
arm
the
right
arm
being
injured
after
a
few
moments
the
vein
swelled
proving
thereby
that
the
blood
was
not
all
exhausted
and
that
circulation
still
continued
although
feebly
the
doctor
then
turned
to
helen
are
you
ready
he
enquired
yes
said
helen
but
make
haste
oh
god
if
he
should
die
the
doctor
compressed
her
arm
with
a
bandage
placed
the
apparatus
upon
the
bed
so
as
to
bring
it
close
to
the
patient
and
put
it
into
water
heated
to
degrees
centigrade
so
that
the
blood
should
not
have
time
to
cool
in
passing
from
one
arm
to
the
other
he
placed
one
end
of
the
syringe
against
karl
arm
and
almost
simultaneously
pricked
helen
so
that
her
blood
spurted
into
the
vessel
when
he
judged
that
there
were
some
to
grammes
he
signed
to
benedict
to
staunch
bleeding
with
his
thumb
and
making
a
longitudinal
cut
in
the
vein
of
karl
arm
he
slipped
in
the
point
of
the
syringe
taking
great
care
that
no
should
get
in
with
the
blood
while
the
operation
which
lasted
about
ten
minutes
was
going
on
a
slight
sound
was
heard
at
the
door
it
was
the
priest
coming
in
accompanied
by
emma
madame
von
beling
and
all
the
servants
helen
turned
saw
them
at
the
door
and
signed
to
them
to
come
in
at
the
same
moment
benedict
pressed
her
arm
karl
had
just
quivered
a
sort
of
shudder
ran
through
his
whole
body
ah
sighed
helen
folding
her
hands
thank
god
it
is
my
blood
reaching
his
heart
benedict
had
ready
a
piece
of
which
he
pressed
upon
the
open
vein
and
held
it
closed
the
priest
approached
he
was
a
roman
catholic
who
had
been
director
from
her
childhood
up
you
sent
for
me
my
child
he
asked
yes
answered
helen
i
desire
if
my
grandmother
and
elder
sister
will
allow
to
marry
this
gentleman
who
with
god
help
will
soon
open
his
eyes
and
recover
his
senses
only
there
is
no
time
to
lose
for
the
swoon
may
return
and
as
though
karl
had
but
awaited
this
moment
to
revive
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
tenderly
at
helen
and
said
in
a
weak
but
intelligible
voice
in
the
depth
of
my
swoon
i
heard
everything
you
are
an
angel
helen
and
i
join
with
you
in
asking
permission
of
your
mother
and
sister
that
i
may
leave
you
my
name
benedict
and
the
doctor
looked
at
each
other
amazed
at
the
which
for
the
moment
restored
sight
to
the
dying
eyes
and
speech
to
his
lips
the
priest
drew
near
to
him
louis
karl
von
freyberg
do
you
declare
acknowledge
and
swear
before
god
and
in
the
face
of
the
holy
church
that

wife
and
lawful
spouse
helen

be
true
to
her
in
all
things
as
a
faithful
husband
should
to
his
wife
according
to
the
commandments
of
god
karl
smiled
sadly
at
this
admonition
of
the
church
meant
for
people
who
expect
to
live
long
and
to
have
time
for
breaking
their
solemn
vow
yes
said
he
and
in
witness
of
it
here
is
my
mother
which
sacred
already
will
become
the
more
sacred
by
passing
through
your
hands
and
you
helen
de
chandroz
do
you
consent
acknowledge
and
swear
before
god
and
the
holy
church
that

take
for
your
husband
and
lawful
spouse
louis
karl
von
freyberg
here
present
oh
yes
yes
father
exclaimed
the
girl
in
place
of
karl
who
was
too
weak
to
speak
the
priest
added
take
this
token
of
the
marriage
vows
exchanged
between
you
as
he
spoke
he
placed
upon
helen
finger
the
ring
given
him
by
karl
i
give
you
this
ring
as
a
sign
of
the
marriage
that
you
have
contracted
the
priest
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
the
bride
hand
saying
in
a
low
voice
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
amen
stretching
out
his
right
hand
towards
the
pair
he
added
aloud
may
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
join
you
together
and
bestow
his
blessing
upon
you
i
unite
you
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
amen
father
said
karl
to
the
priest
if
you
will
now
add
to
the
prayers
that
you
have
just
uttered
for
the
husband
the
absolution
for
the
dying
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
ask
of
you
the
priest
raising
his
hand
pronounced
the
consecrated
words
as
if
karl
soul
had
delayed
until
this
solemn
moment
to
depart
from
the
body
helen
who
had
raised
him
in
her
arms
felt
herself
drawn
to
him
by
an
irresistible
power
her
lips
clung
to
those
of
her
lover
and
between
them
escaped
the
words
farewell
my
darling
wife
your
blood
is
my
blood
farewell
his
body
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
karl
had
breathed
his
last
breath
upon
helen
mouth
one
sob
only
was
heard
from
the
poor
girl
and
the
complete
prostration
with
which
she
fell
back
upon
his
body
showed
everybody
that
he
was
dead
the
spectators
rose
from
their
knees
emma
threw
herself
into
helen
arms
exclaiming
now
we
are
doubly
sisters
by
birth
and
by
affliction
then
feeling
that
this
sorrow
required
solitude
one
after
another
slipped
away
slowly
gently
and
on
tiptoe
leaving
helen
alone
with
her
body
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
benedict
growing
uneasy
ventured
to
go
to
her
and
knocked
slowly
at
the
door
saying
it
is
i
sister
helen
who
had
locked
herself
in
came
to
open
the
door
with
amazement
he
beheld
her
dressed
completely
in
bridal
attire
she
had
put
on
a
wreath
of
white
roses
diamond
earrings
hung
from
her
ears
and
the
costliest
of
necklaces
surrounded
her
neck
her
fingers
were
loaded
with
valuable
rings
her
arm
from
which
the
blood
had
been
drawn
to
perform
the
miracle
of
resurrection
was
covered
with
bracelets
a
magnificent
lace
shawl
was
thrown
over
her
shoulders
and
covered
a
satin
gown
fastened
with
knots
of
pearls
you
see
my
friend
she
said
to
benedict
that
i
have
tried
to
fulfil
his
wishes
completely
i
am
dressed
not
as
his
betrothed
but
as
his
wife
benedict
looked
at
her
sadly
the
rather
that
she
did
not
weep
on
the
contrary
she
smiled
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
given
all
her
tears
to
the
living
karl
and
had
none
left
for
the
dead
benedict
saw
with
profound
surprise
that
she
went
to
and
fro
in
the
room
busied
with
a
number
of
little
matters
relating
to
karl
burial
and
every
moment
showed
him
some
fresh
article
look
she
would
say
he
liked
this
he
noticed
that
we
will
put
it
beside
him
in
his
coffin
by
the
way
she
added
suddenly
i
was
just
forgetting
my
hair
which
he
liked
so
much
she
unfastened
her
wreath
took
hold
of
her
hair
which
hung
below
her
knees
cut
it
off
and
made
a
plait
which
she
knotted
round
karl
bare
neck
evening
came
she
talked
at
length
with
benedict
of
the
hour
at
which
the
funeral
should
take
place
on
the
morrow
as
it
was
now
but
six
in
the
evening
she
begged
him
to
see
to
all
the
details
that
would
be
so
painful
to
the
family
and
indeed
almost
as
painful
to
him
who
had
loved
frederic
and
karl
like
two
brothers
he
was
to
order
a
wide
oak
coffin
himself
why
a
wide
one
benedict
asked
helen
only
answered

as
i
ask
you

friend
and
blessings
will
be
upon
you
she
gave
orders
herself
for
the
body
of
her
husband
to
be
placed
in
its
shroud
at
six
the
next
morning
benedict
obeyed
her
in
everything
he
spent
his
whole
evening
over
these
funeral
preparations
and
did
not
return
to
the
house
until
eleven
he
found
helen
room
transformed
a
double
row
of
candles
burning
around
the
bed
helen
was
sitting
on
the
bed
and
looking
at
karl
even
as
she
no
longer
wept
she
now
no
longer
prayed
what
had
she
left
to
ask
of
heaven
now
that
karl
was
dead
towards
midnight
her
mother
and
sister
who
had
been
praying
and
who
understood
her
calmness
no
more
than
benedict
did
went
to
their
own
rooms
helen
embraced
them
sadly
but
without
tears
and
asked
that
the
little
child
might
be
brought
so
that
she
might
kiss
him
too
she
held
him
some
time
in
her
arms
and
then
gave
him
back
to
his
mother
when
she
was
left
alone
with
benedict
she
said
to
him
pray
take
some
hours
rest
either
here
or
at
home
do
not
be
uneasy
about
me
i
will
be
down
dressed
and
sleep
beside
him
sleep
said
benedict
more
and
more
amazed
yes
said
helen
simply
i
feel
tired
while
he
was
alive
i
could
not
sleep
now
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
when
shall
i
come
back
asked
benedict
when
you
please
said
helen
let
it
be
about
eight
in
the
morning
then
looking
through
the
open
casement
towards
the
sky
she
said
i
think
there
will
be
a
storm
benedict
pressed
her
hand
and
was
going
but
she
called
him
back
excuse
me
dear
friend
said
she
have
you
been
told
that
they
are
coming
at
six
in
the
morning
to
wrap
him
in
his
shroud
yes
said
benedict
his
voice
choked
with
tears
helen
guessed
at
his
feelings
you
do
not
mean
to
kiss
me
then
my
friend
she
observed
benedict
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
broke
into
sobs
how
weak
you
are
said
she
look
how
calm
is
so
calm
that
one
would
think
he
was
happy
and
as
benedict
was
about
to
answer
she
added
go
go
at
eight
as
helen
had
foretold
the
night
was
stormy
with
morning
a
terrible
tempest
broke
out
rain
fell
in
torrents
accompanied
by
such
flashes
of
lightning
as
are
only
seen
in
storms
that
announce
or
cause
great
misfortunes
at
six
the
women
who
were
to
perform
the
last
offices
for
karl
arrived
helen
had
looked
out
the
finest
sheets
she
could
find
and
had
spent
a
part
of
the
night
in
embroidering
them
with
karl
monogram
and
her
own
then
when
her
pious
task
was
completed
she
did
as
she
had
said
lay
down
beside
karl
on
his
bed
and
encircled
by
the
double
row
of
lighted
candles
slept
with
as
sound
a
sleep
as
though
she
were
already
in
her
grave
the
two
women
knocking
at
the
door
awoke
her
seeing
them
come
in
the
material
aspect
of
death
was
forcibly
presented
to
her
and
she
could
not
abstain
from
shedding
tears
stolid
as
these
poor
creatures
who
live
by
the
services
that
they
render
to
the
dead
generally
are
when
they
saw
the
young
girl
so
beautiful
so
adorned
so
pale
they
could
not
help
feeling
an
emotion
unknown
to
them
until
then
they
trembled
as
they
took
the
sheets
from
helen
hands
and
asked
her
to
withdraw
while
they
fulfilled
their
funeral
office
helen
uncovered
karl
face
over
which
the
two
ministers
of
fate
had
already
thrown
the
shroud
kissed
his
lips
murmured
into
his
ear
some
words
that
the
women
did
not
hear
then
addressing
one
of
them
said
i
am
going
to
pray
for
my
husband
in
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
if
between
now
and
eight
a
young
man
named
benedict
comes
here
please
give
him
this
note
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
paper
already
folded
sealed
and
addressed
to
benedict
and
went
away
the
storm
was
roaring
in
all
its
violence
at
the
door
she
found
lenhart
carriage
and
lenhart
himself
he
was
astonished
to
see
her
coming
out
so
early
dressed
in
so
elegant
a
costume
but
when
she
had
directed
him
to
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
to
which
he
had
driven
her
two
or
three
times
before
he
understood
that
she
was
going
to
pray
at
her
usual
shrine
helen
entered
the
church
the
day
was
so
dark
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
find
one
way
if
the
flashes
of
lightning
had
not
shot
their
snakes
of
fire
through
the
coloured
panes
helen
went
straight
to
her
accustomed
chapel
the
statue
of
the
virgin
stood
in
its
place
silent
smiling
decked
with
gold
lace
and
jewels
and
crowned
with
diamonds
at
her
feet
helen
recognized
the
wreath
of
white
roses
that
she
had
hung
there
on
the
day
when
she
had
come
with
karl
and
sworn
to
him
to
love
him
always
and
to
die
with
him
the
day
to
keep
her
vow
had
come
and
she
was
here
to
tell
the
virgin
of
her
readiness
to
keep
her
promise
as
though
that
promise
were
not
an
impiety
then
as
if
that
were
all
that
she
had
to
do
she
made
a
short
prayer
kissed
the
holy
mother
feet
and
went
out
again
to
the
porch
of
the
church
the
weather
had
cleared
a
little
for
the
moment
rain
had
ceased
to
fall
and
a
gleam
of
blue
shone
between
two
clouds
the
air
was
full
of
electricity
the
thunder
was
roaring
in
noisy
outbursts
and
the
flashes
threw
their
blue
light
almost
uninterruptedly
upon
the
pavement
and
the
houses
helen
left
the
church
lenhart
hurried
forward
with
his
carriage
for
her
to
get
in
i
feel
stifled
said
she
let
me
walk
a
little
i
will
follow
you
madam
said
lenhart
as
you
please
she
answered
eight
was
chiming
from
the
cathedral
at
the
same
hour
benedict
was
just
entering
helen
room
where
karl
lay
in
his
shroud
the
two
women
who
had
been
entrusted
with
that
pious
duty
were
praying
by
the
bed
but
helen
was
absent
benedict
began
by
looking
in
every
direction
expecting
to
see
her
praying
in
some
corner
but
not
perceiving
her
in
any
he
enquired
where
she
could
be
one
of
the
women
replied
she
went
out
an
hour
ago
saying
that
she
would
go
to
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
croix
how
was
she
dressed
asked
benedict
and
he
added
with
an
uneasy
presentiment
did
she
not
say
anything
or
leave
any
message
for
me
are
you
the
gentleman
called
m
benedict
returned
the
woman
who
had
answered
his
previous
questions
yes
said
he
then
here
is
a
letter
for
you
she
handed
him
the
note
that
helen
had
left
he
opened
it
hastily
it
contained
only
these
few
lines
my
beloved
brother
i
promised
karl
before
notre
dame
de
la
croix
not
to
outlive
him
karl
is
dead
and
i
am
about
to
die
if
my
body
is
recovered
see
my
dear
benedict
that
it
is
placed
in
my
husband
coffin
this
was
the
reason
why
i
asked
you
to
have
it
made
wide
i
hope
that
god
will
permit
me
to
sleep
in
it
by
karl
side
throughout
eternity
i
bequeath
a
thousand
florins
to
the
person
who
finds
my
body
if
it
should
be
some
boatman
or
fisherman
or
poor
man
with
a
family
if
it
should
be
some
person
who
can
not
or
will
not
accept
the
money
i
leave
him
my
last
blessing
the
morrow
of
karl
death
is
the
day
of
mine
my
farewells
to
all
who
love
me
helen
benedict
was
finishing
the
reading
of
this
letter
when
lenhart
appeared
in
the
doorway
pale
and
dripping
with
water
and
calling
out
oh
how
shall
i
tell
you
benedict
madame
helen
has
just
thrown
herself
into
the
river
come
come
at
once
benedict
looked
round
seized
a
handkerchief
that
was
lying
on
the
bier
still
perfumed
and
damp
with
the
poor
girl
tears
and
rushed
from
the
room
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
he
sprang
into
it
to
your
house
he
called
sharply
to
lenhart
the
latter
accustomed
to
obey
benedict
without
asking
why
put
his
horses
to
the
gallop
moreover
his
house
was
on
the
way
to
the
river
the
house
being
reached
he
leaped
from
the
carriage
took
the
staircase
in
three
strides
and
opening
the
door
called
here
frisk
the
dog
rushed
out
after
his
master
and
was
in
the
carriage
as
soon
as
he
to
the
river
cried
benedict
lenhart
began
to
understand
he
whipped
up
his
horses
and
they
galloped
on
as
quickly
as
before
as
they
drove
benedict
divested
himself
of
his
coat
waistcoat
and
shirt
retaining
only
his
trousers
when
they
arrived
at
the
river
bank
he
saw
some
sailors
with
boathooks
who
were
raking
the
water
for
helen
body
did
you
see
her
throw
herself
into
the
water
he
enquired
of
lenhart
yes
your
honour
he
answered
where
was
it
lenhart
showed
him
the
spot
twenty
florins
for
a
boat
shouted
benedict
a
boatman
brought
one
benedict
followed
by
frisk
sprang
into
it
then
having
steered
it
into
the
line
along
which
helen
body
had
disappeared
he
followed
the
current
holding
frisk
by
the
collar
and
making
him
smell
the
handkerchief
that
he
had
taken
up
from
karl
bed
they
came
to
a
place
in
the
river
where
the
dog
gave
a
melancholy
howl
benedict
let
him
loose
he
sprang
out
and
disappeared
at
once
an
instant
later
he
came
to
the
surface
and
swam
about
above
the
same
place
howling
dismally
yes
said
benedict
yes
she
is
there
then
he
in
his
turn
dived
and
soon
reappeared
bearing
helen
body
on
his
shoulder
as
helen
had
wished
her
body
was
by
benedict
care
laid
in
the
same
coffin
as
karl
her
bridal
garments
were
allowed
to
dry
upon
her
and
she
had
no
other
shroud
chapter
xxxvi
wait
and
see
when
karl
and
helen
had
been
laid
in
their
place
of
eternal
rest
benedict
considered
that
the
time
had
now
arrived
when
having
no
more
services
to
perform
for
the
family
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
he
might
remind
sturm
that
he
was
frederic
von
bülow
executor
always
obedient
to
convention
he
dressed
himself
with
the
greatest
care
hung
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
the
guelphic
order
to
his
buttonhole
by
a
line
gold
chain
and
sent
in
his
name
to
general
sturm
the
general
was
in
his
study
he
ordered
benedict
to
be
shown
in
at
once
and
as
he
entered
rose
from
his
seat
showed
him
a
chair
and
sat
down
again
benedict
indicated
that
he
preferred
to
stand
sir
said
he
the
succession
of
misfortunes
which
has
befallen
the
chandroz
family
leaves
me
free
earlier
than
i
expected
to
come
and
remind
you
that
frederic
when
he
was
dying
bequeathed
to
me
a
sacred
duty
that
of
vengeance
the
general
bowed
and
benedict
returned
his
bow
nothing
now
keeps
me
in
frankfort
but
my
wish
to
fulfil
my
last
injunction
you
know
what
that
injunction
was
for
i
have
told
you
from
this
moment
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
holding
myself
at
your
disposal
that
is
to
say
sir
said
general
sturm
striking
his
fist
upon
the
before
him
that
you
come
here
to
challenge
me
yes
sir
answered
benedict
a
dying
man
wishes
are
sacred
and
frederic
von
bülow
wish
was
that
one
of
us
either
you
or
i
should
disappear
from
this
world
i
deliver
it
to
you
the
more
readily
because
i
know
you
sir
to
be
brave
skilful
in
all
bodily
exercises
and
a
swordsman
and
shot
i
am
not
an
officer
in
the
prussian
army
you
are
in
no
sense
my
chief
i
am
a
frenchman
you
are
a
prussian
we
have
jena
behind
us
and
you
have
leipzig
we
are
therefore
enemies
all
this
makes
me
hope
that
you
will
place
no
difficulty
in
my
way
and
will
consent
to
send
me
two
seconds
who
will
find
mine
at
my
house
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
morning
and
will
do
me
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
them
the
hour
place
and
weapons
that
you
have
chosen
everything
will
be
acceptable
to
me
make
what
conditions
you
like
in
the
best
way
you
can
i
hope
that
you
are
satisfied
general
sturm
had
shown
frequent
signs
of
impatience
during
speech
but
had
controlled
himself
like
a
man
sir
said
he
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
hear
from
me
by
the
hour
you
name
and
perhaps
earlier
this
was
all
that
benedict
wanted
he
bowed
and
withdrew
delighted
that
everything
had
passed
off
so
properly
he
was
already
at
the
door
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
omitted
to
give
the
general
his
new
address
at
lenhart
he
went
to
a
table
and
wrote
the
street
and
number
below
his
name
on
his
card
excuse
me
said
he
i
must
not
fail
to
let
your
excellency
know
where
i
am
to
be
found
are
you
not
my
neighbour
asked
the
general
no
said
benedict
i
have
left
this
house
since
the
day
before
yesterday
on
the
same
evening
since
he
expected
to
leave
frankfort
immediately
after
next
day
duel
unless
indeed
some
wound
should
detain
him
benedict
left
cards
of
farewell
at
all
the
houses
where
he
had
visited
withdrew
his
money
from
the
bank
and
his
banker
having
detained
him
remained
at
his
house
until
eleven
and
then
took
leave
to
return
to
lenhart
but
as
he
was
crossing
the
corner
of
the
ross
market
an
officer
accosted
him
and
saying
that
he
had
a
communication
to
make
on
behalf
of
the
officer
in
command
of
the
town
begged
benedict
to
accompany
him
the
latter
made
no
difficulty
about
entering
the
market
place
where
military
were
quartered
and
there
at
a
sign
from
the
officer
soldiers
surrounded
him
sir
said
the
officer
will
you
kindly
read
this
paper
which
concerns
you
benedict
took
the
paper
and
read
it
by
order
of
the
colonel
in
command
of
the
town
and
as
a
measure
of
public
safety
benedict
turpin
is
instructed
to
leave
frankfort
instantly
upon
receipt
of
the
present
order
should
he
refuse
to
obey
willingly
force
is
to
be
employed
six
privates
and
an
officer
will
accompany
him
to
the
station
enter
the
same
carriage
in
the
cologne
train
and
only
leave
him
at
the
frontier
of
the
prussian
territory
this
order
to
be
carried
out
before
midnight
signed
benedict
looked
round
he
had
no
possible
means
of
resistance
sir
said
he
if
i
had
any
way
of
escaping
from
the
order
that
i
have
just
read
i
declare
to
you
that
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
get
out
of
your
hands
the
great
man
who
is
your
minister
and
whom
i
admire
although
i
do
not
like
him
has
said
is
right
i
am
ready
to
yield
to
force
but
i
should
be
greatly
obliged
if
one
of
you
would
go
to
beckenheim
street
to
a
man
who
lets
out
carriages
named
lenhart
and
kindly
ask
him
to
bring
me
my
dog
of
which
i
am
very
fond
i
will
take
occasion
to
give
him
some
orders
in
your
presence
that
are
of
no
particular
consequence
but
rather
important
to
a
man
who
has
been
living
in
a
town
for
three
months
and
is
leaving
when
he
had
no
expectation
of
doing
so
the
officer
ordered
a
soldier
to
fulfil
benedict
wish
sir
said
he
i
know
that
you
were
intimate
with
a
man
to
whom
we
were
all
attached
herr
frederic
von
bülow
although
i
have
not
the
honour
of
your
personal
acquaintance
i
should
be
sorry
that
you
should
carry
away
a
bad
impression
of
me
i
was
ordered
to
arrest
you
in
the
manner
that
i
have
done
i
hope
you
will
pardon
an
action
entirely
outside
my
own
wishes
and
which
i
have
tried
to
perform
with
as
much
courtesy
as
possible
benedict
held
out
his
hand
i
have
been
a
soldier
sir
and
therefore
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
an
explanation
that
you
might
easily
have
refrained
from
making
a
minute
or
so
later
lenhart
arrived
with
frisk
my
dear
lenhart
said
benedict
i
am
leaving
frankfort
unexpectedly
be
so
kind
as
to
collect
any
things
belonging
to
me
that
you
may
have
and
send
them
to
me
in
two
or
three
days
unless
you
prefer
to
bring
them
yourself
to
paris
which
you
do
not
know
and
where
i
would
try
to
make
you
spend
a
pleasant
fortnight
i
do
not
offer
any
terms
you
know
that
you
may
safely
leave
such
matters
in
my
hands
oh
i
will
go
sir
i
will
go
said
lenhart
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
now
said
benedict
i
think
it
must
be
time
for
the
train
no
doubt
you
have
a
carriage
waiting
let
us
go
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
wait
for
and
if
you
have
not
a
travelling
companion
to
give
me
the
soldiers
lined
up
and
benedict
passed
between
them
to
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
frisk
always
delighted
to
go
from
one
place
to
another
leapt
in
first
as
if
to
invite
his
master
to
follow
benedict
stepped
in
the
officer
followed
him
four
privates
followed
the
officer
a
fifth
seated
himself
beside
the
driver
a
sixth
jumped
up
behind
and
the
conveyance
set
out
for
the
station
the
engine
was
just
ready
to
start
as
the
prisoner
arrived
he
had
not
even
the
trouble
of
waiting
a
few
minutes
at
the
carriage
door
frisk
was
as
usual
the
first
to
jump
in
and
although
it
is
not
customary
especially
in
prussia
for
dogs
to
travel
benedict
obtained
for
him
the
favour
of
remaining
with
them
next
morning
they
were
at
cologne
sir
said
benedict
to
the
officer
i
am
accustomed
every
time
that
i
pass
through
this
town
to
provide
myself
with
farina
for
my
if
you
are
not
pressed
for
time
i
would
propose
two
things
to
you
in
the
first
place
my
word
of
honour
to
play
fair
and
not
give
you
the
slip
before
reaching
the
frontier
in
the
second
place
a
good
breakfast
for
these
gentlemen
and
you
all
breakfasting
together
at
the
same
table
without
any
distinction
of
rank
like
brothers
then
we
will
take
the
midday
train
unless
you
prefer
to
trust
my
word
that
i
will
go
straight
to
paris
the
officer
smiled
sir
said
he
we
will
do
what
you
please
i
should
like
you
to
carry
away
the
impression
that
we
are
only
uncivil
and
tormentors
when
we
are
ordered
to
be
you
want
to
stay
then
let
us
stay
you
offer
me
your
word
i
accept
it
you
wish
to
have
us
all
breakfast
with
you
although
it
does
not
conform
either
to
prussian
habits
or
prussian
discipline
i
accept
the
only
precaution
we
will
take
and
that
rather
to
do
you
honour
than
because
we
doubt
your
word
will
be
to
see
you
off
at
the
station
where
do
you
wish
us
to
meet
you
again
at
the
rhine
hotel
if
you
please
gentlemen
in
an
hour
time
i
need
not
say
added
the
officer
speaking
in
french
that
the
soldiers
should
not
understand
him
that
after
the
way
i
have
behaved
to
you
i
ought
to
be
cashiered
benedict
bowed
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
you
need
be
under
no
uneasiness
sir
benedict
went
away
to
the
cathedral
square
where
jean
marie
shop
is
situated
and
the
officer
took
off
his
men
in
another
direction
benedict
supplied
himself
with
which
he
could
the
more
easily
do
because
having
no
other
luggage
he
could
carry
his
purchase
with
him
and
then
proceeded
to
the
rhine
hotel
where
he
was
accustomed
to
stay
he
ordered
the
best
breakfast
that
the
proprietor
could
promise
him
and
awaited
his
guests
who
appeared
at
the
agreed
time
the
breakfast
was
a
thoroughly
cheerful
one
the
prosperity
of
france
and
the
prosperity
of
prussia
were
toasted
the
prussians
courteously
setting
the
example
and
after
breakfast
benedict
was
escorted
to
the
station
and
by
military
order
had
a
carriage
to
himself
instead
of
sharing
one
with
six
private
soldiers
and
an
officer
at
the
moment
of
the
train
starting
the
officer
put
into
hand
a
letter
which
the
traveller
opened
as
soon
as
the
train
had
passed
out
of
the
station
he
gave
a
glance
at
the
signature
it
came
as
he
expected
from
general
sturm
and
contained
these
words
my
dear
sir
you
will
understand
that
it
does
not
become
a
superior
officer
to
set
a
bad
example
by
accepting
a
challenge
of
which
the
object
is
to
avenge
an
officer
who
was
punished
for
disobedience
to
his
chief
if
i
were
to
fight
you
for
a
reason
so
contrary
to
all
military
discipline
i
should
be
setting
a
fatal
example
to
the
army
i
refuse
therefore
for
the
present
to
meet
you
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
scandal
i
employ
one
of
the
most
courteous
measures
at
my
disposal
you
yourself
were
so
good
as
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
a
reputation
for
courage
and
you
added
that
you
knew
me
to
be
a
shot
and
swordsman
you
can
not
therefore
attribute
my
refusal
to
any
fear
of
facing
you
a
proverb
common
to
all
countries
says
do
not
meet
but
men
do
if
we
meet
anywhere
else
than
in
prussia
and
if
you
are
still
desirous
of
killing
me
we
will
see
about
settling
this
little
matter
but
i
warn
you
that
the
result
is
by
no
means
a
foregone
conclusion
and
that
you
will
have
more
trouble
than
you
expect
in
keeping
your
promise
to
your
friend
frederic
benedict
refolded
the
letter
with
the
utmost
care
placed
it
in
his
and
slipped
his
into
his
pocket
arranged
himself
as
comfortably
as
he
could
in
a
corner
and
closing
his
eyes
for
sleep
murmured
well
well
we
will
wait
and
see
conclusion
the
presence
of
the
prussians
in
frankfort
and
the
terror
that
they
caused
there
did
not
end
with
the
events
which
have
just
been
related
and
to
which
the
present
narrative
ought
to
confine
itself
a
few
lines
only
must
be
added
that
our
work
may
close
as
it
opened
by
a
page
of
politics
towards
the
end
of
september
it
was
announced
that
the
city
of
frankfort
losing
its
nationality
its
title
of
a
free
town
its
privilege
of
having
the
diet
held
there
and
finally
its
rights
as
a
member
of
the
confederation
was
to
be
united
on
october
to
the
kingdom
of
prussia
the
morrow
was
gloomy
and
rainy
no
house
had
hung
out
the
flag
no
citizen
sad
or
cheerful
was
in
the
streets
every
window
was
shuttered
every
door
closed
it
seemed
a
city
of
the
dead
the
flag
flew
only
over
the
barracks
the
exchange
and
the
post
office
but
in
the
roemer
square
there
was
an
assemblage
of
some
three
or
four
hundred
men
all
belonging
to
the
suburb
of
sachsenhausen
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
each
of
these
men
had
a
dog
of
some
description
with
him
a
bulldog
mastiff
spaniel
hound
griffon
greyhound
or
poodle
amidst
these
bipeds
and
quadrupeds
lenhart
went
up
and
down
relating
what
fine
things
he
had
seen
in
paris
and
holding
attention
he
it
was
who
had
devised
this
meeting
of
his
fellow
inhabitants
of
sachsenhausen
and
who
by
whispered
instructions
had
invited
them
to
bring
their
dogs
men
and
dogs
alike
gazed
towards
the
window
from
which
the
proclamation
was
to
be
made
they
had
been
waiting
there
since
nine
in
the
morning
at
eleven
the
members
of
the
senate
the
christian
and
jewish
clergy
the
professors
the
chief
officials
and
boyer
with
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
gathered
together
in
the
hall
of
the
emperors
in
the
roemer
to
witness
the
taking
possession
of
the
formerly
free
town
of
frankfort
by
his
gracious
majesty
the
king
of
prussia
the
civil
governor
baron
patow
and
the
civil
commissioner
herr
von
madaï
came
from
the
senate
hall
once
the
hall
in
which
the
emperors
of
germany
were
elected
into
the
great
hall
after
some
little
preamble
on
baron
patow
part
he
read
to
the
persons
present
the
patent
by
which
the
former
free
town
of
frankfort
was
taken
into
possession
and
then
the
royal
proclamation
which
announced
that
the
town
had
been
added
to
the
prussian
dominions
the
same
documents
were
now
to
be
read
to
the
people
of
frankfort
the
window
was
opened
to
an
accompaniment
of
joyful
murmurs
and
mocking
acclamation
from
the
men
of
sachsenhausen
and
the
yawns
of
their
dogs
the
square
was
occupied
we
forgot
to
mention
not
only
by
the
men
from
sachsenhausen
but
by
a
company
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
and
its
band
herr
von
madaï
read
aloud
the
following
proclamation
the
very
high
and
very
powerful
proclamation
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
prussia
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
former
free
town
of
frankfort
either
because
the
voice
of
herr
von
madaï
was
particularly
disagreeable
to
his
hearers
or
because
the
words
former
free
town
of
frankfort
aroused
their
sensibility
several
dogs
howled
dismally
herr
von
madaï
paused
until
silence
was
restored
and
continued
still
in
the
name
by
the
patent
that
i
cause
to
be
published
i
unite
you
inhabitants
of
the
city
of
and
its
suburbs
to
my
subjects
your
german
neighbours
and
brothers
five
or
six
howls
protested
against
this
union
herr
von
madaï
seemed
to
give
no
heed
to
them
and
proceeded
by
the
decision
of
the
war
and
the
reorganization
of
our
common
german
fatherland
you
are
deprived
of
the
independence
which
you
have
hitherto
enjoyed
and
now
enter
the
union
of
a
great
country
whose
population
is
sympathetic
to
you
by
language
customs
and
identity
of
interests
this
news
did
not
appear
agreeable
to
the
prejudices
of
some
hearers
there
were
complaints
growls
and
a
certain
number
of
lamentations
herr
von
madaï
seemed
to
understand
these
sad
protestations
if
said
he
it
is
not
without
pain
that
you
resign
former
connections
that
were
dear
to
you
i
respect
such
feelings
and
esteem
them
as
a
guarantee
that
you
and
your
children
will
be
faithfully
attached
to
me
and
my
house
an
enormous
bulldog
replied
by
a
single
bark
which
appeared
however
to
speak
the
opinion
of
the
two
or
three
hundred
companions
around
him
the
interruption
did
not
disturb
herr
von
madaï
and
he
went
on
you
will
recognize
the
force
of
accomplished
facts
if
the
fruits
of
an
obstinate
war
and
of
bloody
victories
are
not
to
be
lost
to
germany
the
duty
of
and
care
for
national
interests
imperatively
demand
that
the
town
of
frankfort
shall
be
joined
to
prussia
solidly
and
for
ever
at
this
moment
a
dog
broke
its
chain
and
despite
shouts
of
arrest
the
rebel
arrest
the
rebel
and
the
pursuit
of
some
five
or
six
sachsenhausen
urchins
disappeared
into
the
jewry
and
as
my
father
of
blessed
memory
declared
resumed
herr
von
madaï
it
is
solely
for
the
profit
of
germany
that
prussia
has
enlarged
its
boundaries
i
offer
this
for
your
serious
reflection
and
i
confide
in
your
upright
german
good
sense
to
swear
allegiance
to
me
with
the
same
sincerity
as
my
own
people
may
god
grant
it
william
given
at
my
castle
of
babelsberg
october
and
raising
his
voice
herr
von
madaï
added
by
way
of
peroration
hurrah
for
king
william
hurrah
for
the
king
of
prussia
at
the
same
instant
the
flag
was
hoisted
on
the
topmost
gable
of
the
roemer
no
shout
replied
to
herr
von
madaï
only
the
voice
of
lenhart
was
heard
like
that
of
a
drill
sergeant
and
now
my
little
doggies
as
you
have
the
honour
to
be
prussian
dogs
shout
for
the
king
of
prussia
then
every
man
pressed
his
toe
upon
the
tail
the
ear
or
the
paw
of
his
dog
and
there
arose
such
frightful
uproar
including
the
deepest
and
the
shrillest
notes
as
could
only
be
covered
by
the
band
of
the
prussian
regiment
playing
dir
im
which
means
hail
to
thee
in
the
crown
of
victory
thus
was
the
former
free
town
of
frankfort
united
to
the
kingdom
of
prussia
but
many
people
say
that
it
is
not
stitched
but
only
tacked
on
epilogue
on
june
in
the
year
a
young
man
of
some
to
years
of
age
elegantly
dressed
and
wearing
at
his
buttonhole
a
ribbon
half
red
and
half
had
just
finished
his
cup
of
chocolate
at
the
café
prévôt
which
was
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
poissonière
he
asked
for
the
étandard
newspaper
he
had
to
repeat
the
name
twice
to
the
waiter
who
not
having
the
paper
on
the
premises
went
out
to
the
boulevard
for
a
copy
and
brought
it
to
his
customer
the
latter
cast
his
eyes
rapidly
over
it
looking
evidently
for
some
article
that
he
knew
to
be
there
his
glance
settled
at
last
upon
the
following
lines
wednesday
june
the
king
of
prussia
will
enter
paris
we
give
a
complete
list
of
the
persons
who
will
accompany
his
majesty
de
bismarck
general
de
moltke
count
puckler
lord
marshal
general
de
treskow
count
de
goltz
count
lehendorff
to
the
king
general
achilles
sturm
doubtless
the
young
man
had
seen
all
that
he
wanted
to
see
for
he
carried
no
further
his
investigations
into
the
persons
accompanying
his
majesty
but
he
tried
to
discover
at
what
hour
king
william
was
to
arrive
and
found
that
he
was
expected
at
a
four
at
the
gare
du
nord
he
immediately
took
a
carriage
and
placed
himself
upon
the
road
which
the
king
would
have
to
follow
in
going
to
the
tuileries
the
king
and
his
escort
were
some
minutes
behind
their
time
our
young
man
was
waiting
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
de
magenta
he
placed
himself
at
the
end
of
the
procession
and
accompanied
it
to
the
tuileries
keeping
his
eyes
particularly
as
he
did
so
upon
the
carriage
which
contained
general
von
treskow
count
von
goltz
and
general
achilles
sturm
that
carriage
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
with
the
king
of
prussia
but
came
out
again
almost
immediately
with
the
three
generals
who
occupied
it
in
order
to
go
to
the
hôtel
du
louvre
there
the
three
generals
alighted
they
were
clearly
intending
to
lodge
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
tuileries
where
their
sovereign
was
staying
our
young
man
who
also
had
alighted
saw
a
waiter
lead
them
to
their
several
rooms
he
waited
a
moment
but
none
of
them
came
out
again
he
got
into
his
carriage
again
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
pyramides
he
knew
all
that
he
wanted
to
know
next
morning
about
eleven
the
same
young
man
was
walking
in
front
of
the
café
belonging
to
the
hotel
and
smoking
a
cigarette
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
his
expectation
was
satisfied
general
sturm
came
from
the
hôtel
du
louvre
into
the
restaurant
sat
down
at
one
of
the
marble
tables
arranged
just
inside
the
windows
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
glass
of
brandy
this
was
just
opposite
the
zouave
barracks
benedict
entered
the
barracks
and
came
out
a
minute
later
with
two
officers
he
led
them
in
front
of
the
window
and
showed
them
general
sturm
gentlemen
said
he
that
is
a
prussian
general
with
whom
i
have
so
serious
a
quarrel
that
one
of
us
must
be
left
upon
the
field
i
have
applied
to
you
to
do
me
the
favour
of
acting
as
my
seconds
because
you
are
officers
because
you
do
not
know
me
and
do
not
know
my
adversary
and
consequently
will
not
have
any
of
those
little
delicate
considerations
for
us
that
fashionable
people
have
towards
those
for
whom
they
act
as
seconds
we
will
go
in
and
sit
down
at
the
same
table
with
him
i
will
reproach
him
with
what
i
have
to
reproach
him
with
and
you
will
see
whether
the
matter
is
serious
enough
for
a
duel
to
the
death
if
you
judge
it
to
be
so
you
will
do
me
the
honour
of
being
my
seconds
i
am
a
soldier
like
yourselves
i
went
through
the
chinese
war
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
i
fought
at
the
battle
of
langensalza
as
orderly
to
prince
ernest
of
hanover
and
finally
i
fired
one
of
the
last
shots
at
the
battle
of
aschaffenburg
my
name
is
benedict
turpin
and
i
am
a
knight
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
of
the
guelphic
order
the
two
officers
stepped
back
a
pace
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
and
returned
to
benedict
side
to
tell
him
that
they
were
at
his
command
all
three
then
entered
the
café
and
went
to
seat
themselves
at
the
general
table
the
latter
looked
up
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
benedict
whom
he
recognized
at
the
first
glance
ah
it
is
you
sir
said
he
growing
rather
pale
yes
sir
answered
benedict
and
here
are
these
gentlemen
who
are
still
unacquainted
with
the
explanation
that
i
am
about
to
have
with
you
and
are
here
to
hear
what
i
say
and
will
be
kind
enough
to
assist
me
in
our
combat
will
you
allow
me
to
explain
to
these
gentlemen
in
your
presence
the
cause
of
our
meeting
and
afterwards
will
you
give
them
details
of
our
antecedents
as
we
go
together
to
the
place
decided
upon
you
remember
sir
that
nearly
a
year
ago
you
did
me
the
honour
of
writing
to
me
that
mountains
did
not
meet
but
that
men
did
and
that
whenever
i
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
outside
the
kingdom
of
his
majesty
king
william
you
would
put
no
difficulty
in
the
way
of
giving
me
satisfaction
the
general
rose
it
is
useless
said
he
to
prolong
an
explanation
in
a
café
where
everybody
can
hear
what
we
say
you
can
give
any
explanations
to
these
gentlemen
of
the
grounds
of
complaint
which
you
consider
yourself
to
have
against
me
and
which
i
am
not
in
any
degree
bound
to
disclaim
to
you
i
wrote
to
you
that
i
was
ready
to
give
you
satisfaction
i
am
give
me
time
to
go
into
the
hotel
and
fetch
two
friends
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
do
so
sir
said
benedict
bowing
sturm
left
the
café
benedict
and
the
two
officers
followed
him
he
went
into
the
hôtel
du
louvre
the
three
gentlemen
waited
at
the
door
in
the
ten
minutes
during
which
they
waited
benedict
told
them
the
whole
story
and
was
just
concluding
it
as
the
general
reappeared
with
his
seconds
two
officers
of
the
king
retinue
all
three
came
towards
benedict
and
bowed
to
him
benedict
introduced
his
own
seconds
to
those
of
the
general
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
all
four
drew
apart
a
little
presently
benedict
seconds
came
back
to
him
you
have
left
the
choice
of
weapons
to
the
general
said
he
yes
sir
and
he
has
chosen
the
sword
we
are
to
go
to
a
sword
cutler
and
choose
a
couple
of
blades
that
neither
of
you
will
have
seen
before
then
we
are
to
go
to
the
nearest
convenient
spot
for
the
meeting
we
suggested
the
fortifications
and
these
gentlemen
have
agreed
they
are
to
take
an
open
carriage
we
are
to
take
another
and
as
they
do
not
know
the
way
and
we
do
we
shall
guide
them
along
the
boulevard
and
at
the
first
we
will
buy
the
swords
everything
was
arranged
accordingly
two
waiters
were
sent
for
two
carriages
the
seconds
suggested
that
the
of
the
zouaves
should
accompany
the
party
and
the
suggestion
being
accepted
one
of
the
officers
went
to
fetch
him
he
joined
benedict
and
the
two
frenchmen
while
general
sturm
and
his
seconds
followed
at
some
distance
at
the
which
was
claudin
benedict
said
in
an
aside
to
the
shopman
whom
he
knew
the
swords
are
to
be
charged
to
me
let
the
gentlemen
who
are
in
the
second
carriage
choose
them
three
different
swords
were
shown
to
general
sturm
who
selected
the
one
that
best
suited
his
hand
and
asked
its
price
he
was
told
that
they
were
paid
for
the
two
carriages
went
as
far
as
the
étoile
turnpike
by
way
of
the
maillot
gate
thence
they
followed
the
line
of
the
fortifications
for
a
short
distance
then
when
they
had
reached
a
tolerably
deserted
spot
the
two
zouave
officers
alighted
from
their
chaise
looked
up
and
down
the
fosse
and
finding
it
empty
beckoned
their
adversaries
to
join
them
in
another
minute
the
whole
party
was
standing
at
the
base
of
the
walls
the
ground
was
level
and
offered
every
facility
for
a
combat
of
the
kind
that
was
now
to
take
place
the
general
seconds
presented
the
two
swords
to
benedict
who
had
not
previously
seen
them
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
them
and
saw
that
they
were
en
a
circumstance
which
suited
his
designs
admirably
apparently
it
suited
general
sturm
also
since
he
had
chosen
the
swords
when
is
the
fight
to
stop
asked
the
seconds
when
one
of
us
is
killed
answered
the
two
antagonists
together
coats
off
gentlemen
said
the
seconds
benedict
threw
aside
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
displaying
his
shirt
are
you
ready
gentlemen
asked
the
seconds
yes
replied
both
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
zouave
officers
took
one
sword
and
put
it
into
hands
one
of
the
prussian
officers
took
the
other
and
put
it
into
general
sturm
hands
the
seconds
crossed
the
two
swords
at
a
distance
of
three
inches
from
the
points
and
moving
aside
to
leave
the
combatants
face
to
face
said
now
gentlemen
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
the
general
swiftly
made
himself
master
of
his
opponent
sword
by
a
double
engagement
making
as
he
did
so
a
stride
forward
with
all
the
usual
impetuosity
of
a
man
who
knows
himself
an
adept
in
fencing
benedict
leapt
back
then
looking
at
the
general
guard
ah
ah
he
murmured
a
quick
fellow
on
his
feet
attention
he
exchanged
a
quick
glance
with
his
seconds
to
tell
them
not
to
be
uneasy
but
at
the
same
moment
and
without
any
interval
the
general
while
entangling
the
sword
by
a
skilful
pressure
advanced
in
a
crouching
attitude
and
lunged
with
so
rapid
a
that
it
needed
all
benedict
close
handling
to
parry
by
a
which
quick
though
it
was
could
not
save
his
shoulder
from
a
graze
the
shirt
tore
upon
the
sword
point
and
became
slightly
tinged
with
blood
the
return
thrust
came
so
swiftly
that
the
prussian
by
luck
or
by
instinct
had
not
time
to
resort
to
a
circular
parry
and
mechanically
employed
the
de
and
was
now
on
the
defensive
the
thrust
was
parried
but
it
had
been
given
with
such
energy
that
general
sturm
staggered
on
his
legs
and
could
not
deliver
his
counter
thrust
he
is
a
pretty
fencer
after
all
thought
benedict
he
gives
one
something
to
do
sturm
stepped
back
and
lowered
his
point
you
are
wounded
said
he
come
come
returned
the
young
man
no
nonsense
here
a
fuss
about
a
scratch
you
know
very
well
general
that
i
have
got
to
kill
you
one
must
keep
one
word
even
to
a
dead
man
he
put
himself
in
position
again
you
kill
me
upstart
exclaimed
the
general
yes
i
greenhorn
as
you
think
me
replied
benedict
your
blood
for
his
although
all
yours
is
not
equal
to
one
drop
of
his
cursed
rascal
swore
sturm
growing
crimson
and
rushing
upon
benedict
he
made
as
he
came
two
successive
de
so
hasty
and
so
furious
that
benedict
had
barely
time
to
parry
them
by
twice
retiring
and
then
a
de
delivered
with
such
precision
and
energy
that
the
loose
shirt
was
torn
above
the
waistband
and
benedict
felt
the
cold
steel
another
stain
of
blood
appeared
what
are
you
trying
to
tear
off
my
shirt
said
benedict
sending
his
enemy
a
high
de
which
would
have
run
him
through
but
that
feeling
himself
in
danger
he
flung
himself
forward
in
such
a
manner
that
the
hilts
touched
and
the
two
adversaries
stood
with
their
swords
up
face
to
face
here
cried
benedict
this
will
teach
you
to
steal
my
thrust
and
before
the
seconds
could
interpose
their
swords
to
separate
them
benedict
freeing
his
arm
like
a
spring
drove
the
two
hilts
like
the
blow
of
a
fist
in
his
adversary
face
who
staggered
back
his
face
lacerated
and
bruised
by
the
blow
then
followed
a
scene
which
made
those
who
beheld
it
shudder
sturm
drew
back
for
an
instant
his
mouth
and
foaming
his
teeth
clenched
and
bleeding
his
lips
turned
back
his
eyes
gleaming
bloodshot
and
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
his
whole
countenance
reddish
purple
blackguard
dog
he
yelled
waving
his
sword
and
crouching
back
for
his
guard
like
a
jaguar
ready
to
spring
benedict
stood
calm
cold
contemptuous
he
extended
his
sword
towards
him
you
belong
to
me
now
he
said
in
a
solemn
voice
you
are
about
to
die
he
fell
back
to
his
guard
exaggerating
the
pose
as
a
sort
of
challenge
he
had
not
to
wait
long
sturm
was
too
good
a
fencer
to
throw
himself
unprotected
upon
his
enemy
he
advanced
sharply
one
pace
making
double
of
which
benedict
turned
aside
the
second
by
a
fait
comme
on
les
passe
au
anger
had
disturbed
sturm
guard
he
was
lunging
with
his
head
down
an
attitude
which
for
this
once
at
least
saved
him
the
merely
grazed
his
shoulder
by
the
neck
blood
appeared
a
sleeve
for
a
sleeve
retorted
benedict
falling
back
quickly
to
his
guard
and
leaving
a
great
distance
between
the
general
and
himself
now
for
it
the
general
found
himself
too
far
off
took
a
step
forward
gathered
all
his
powers
made
a
frenzied
beating
with
his
sword
and
struck
straight
lunging
at
the
full
stretch
of
his
body
all
his
soul
that
is
to
say
all
his
hope
was
in
that
blow
this
time
benedict
planted
firmly
on
his
feet
did
not
yield
an
inch
he
caught
the
sword
un
demi
executed
in
due
form
with
his
nails
held
upwards
as
though
he
were
in
a
fencing
school
and
standing
over
the
point
of
his
sword
inclined
towards
his
feet
now
then
he
said
delivering
his
thrust
the
sword
entered
the
upper
part
of
the
chest
and
disappeared
completely
in
the
general
body
where
benedict
left
it
as
he
sprang
back
as
a
bull
fighter
leaves
his
dagger
in
the
breast
of
the
bull
then
folding
his
arms
he
waited
the
general
remained
standing
for
a
second
staggered
tried
to
speak
his
mouth
became
full
of
blood
he
made
a
movement
with
his
sword
and
the
sword
fell
from
his
hand
then
he
himself
like
an
uprooted
tree
fell
full
length
upon
the
turf
the
surgeon
rushed
to
the
body
of
sturm
but
he
was
already
dead
the
point
of
the
sword
had
gone
in
below
the
right
shoulder
blade
and
come
out
on
the
left
hip
after
passing
through
the
heart
muttered
the
surgeon
that
a
man
well
killed
such
was
sturm
funeral
oration
the
end
