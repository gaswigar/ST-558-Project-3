perhaps
the
readers
and
lovers
of
this
little
book
will
be
glad
of
a
few
pages
by
way
of
introduction
which
shall
show
them
somewhat
of
miss
andrews
herself
and
of
her
way
of
writing
and
teaching
as
an
old
friend
and
schoolmate
may
try
to
tell
it
and
to
begin
with
a
glimpse
of
the
happy
day
when
she
called
a
few
of
her
friends
together
to
listen
to
the
stories
contained
in
this
volume
before
they
were
offered
to
a
publisher
picture
to
yourselves
a
group
of
young
ladies
in
one
of
the
loveliest
of
parlors
looking
out
on
a
broad
street
in
the
old
town
of
newburyport
the
room
is
long
and
large
with
wide
mahogany
seats
in
the
four
deep
windows
ancient
mahogany
chairs
and
great
bookcases
across
one
side
of
the
room
with
dark
and
and
large
mirror
all
of
ancestral
new
england
solidity
and
rich
simplicity
some
saintly
portraits
on
the
wall
a
modern
easel
in
the
corner
accounting
for
fine
bits
of
coloring
on
canvas
crayon
drawings
about
the
room
and
a
gorgeous
firescreen
of
autumn
tints
nasturtium
vines
in
bloom
glorifying
the
south
window
and
german
ivy
decorating
the
north
corner
choice
books
here
and
there
not
to
look
at
only
but
to
be
assimilated
with
an
air
of
quiet
refinement
and
the
very
essence
of
cultured
homeness
pervading
all
this
is
the
meagre
outline
of
a
room
which
having
once
sat
within
you
would
wish
never
to
see
changed
in
which
many
pure
and
noble
men
and
women
have
loved
to
commune
with
the
lives
which
have
been
so
blent
with
all
its
suggestions
that
it
almost
seems
a
part
of
their
organic
being
but
it
was
years
ago
this
memorial
was
written
in
that
this
circle
of
congenial
and
expectant
young
people
were
drawn
together
in
the
room
to
listen
to
the
first
reading
of
the
mss
of
the
seven
little
sisters
i
will
not
name
them
all
but
one
whose
youthful
fame
and
genius
were
the
pride
of
all
harriet
prescott
now
spofford
was
jane
friend
and
neighbor
for
years
and
heard
most
of
her
books
in
mss
they
were
all
friends
and
in
a
very
sympathetic
and
eager
attitude
of
mind
you
may
well
believe
for
in
the
midst
by
the
sits
jane
who
has
called
them
together
and
knowing
that
she
has
really
written
a
book
each
one
feels
almost
that
she
herself
has
written
it
in
some
unconscious
way
because
each
feels
identified
with
jane
work
and
is
ready
to
be
as
proud
of
it
and
as
sure
of
it
as
all
the
world
is
now
of
the
success
of
miss
jane
andrews
writings
for
the
boys
and
girls
in
these
little
stories
of
geography
and
history
which
bear
her
name
i
can
see
jane
sitting
there
as
i
wish
you
could
with
her
mss
on
the
table
at
her
side
she
is
very
sweet
and
good
and
with
soft
heavy
braids
of
hair
carefully
arranged
on
her
fine
shapely
head
her
forehead
is
full
and
broad
her
eyes
large
dark
blue
and
pleasantly
commanding
but
with
very
gentle
and
dreamy
phases
interrupting
their
placid
decision
of
expression
her
features
are
classic
and
firm
in
outline
with
pronounced
resolution
in
the
close
of
the
full
lips
or
of
hearty
merriment
in
the
open
laugh
illuminated
by
a
dazzle
of
teeth
her
complexion
fresh
and
pure
and
the
whole
aspect
of
her
face
kind
courageous
and
inspiring
as
well
as
thoughtful
and
impressive
the
poise
of
her
head
and
rather
strongly
built
figure
is
unusually
good
and
suggestive
of
health
dignity
and
leadership
yet
her
manners
and
voice
are
so
gentle
and
her
whole
demeanor
so
benevolent
that
no
one
could
be
offended
at
her
taking
naturally
the
direction
of
any
work
or
the
planning
of
any
scheme
which
she
would
also
be
foremost
in
executing
but
there
she
sits
looking
up
at
her
friends
with
her
papers
in
hand
and
the
pretty
businesslike
air
that
so
well
became
her
and
bespeaks
the
extreme
criticism
of
her
hearers
upon
what
she
shall
read
because
she
really
wants
to
know
how
it
affects
them
and
what
mistakes
or
faults
can
be
detected
for
she
must
do
her
work
as
well
as
possible
and
is
sure
they
are
willing
to
help
you
see
says
jane
i
have
dedicated
the
book
to
the
children
i
told
the
stories
to
first
when
the
plan
was
only
partly
in
my
mind
and
they
seemed
to
grow
by
telling
till
at
last
they
finished
themselves
and
the
children
seemed
to
care
so
much
for
them
that
i
thought
if
they
were
put
into
a
book
other
children
might
care
for
them
too
and
they
might
possibly
do
some
good
in
the
world
yes
those
were
the
points
that
always
indicated
the
essential
aim
and
method
of
jane
writing
and
teaching
the
elements
out
of
which
sprang
all
her
work
the
relation
of
her
mind
to
the
actual
individual
children
she
knew
and
loved
and
the
natural
growth
of
her
thought
through
their
sympathy
and
the
accretion
of
all
she
read
and
discovered
while
the
subject
lay
within
her
brooding
brain
as
well
as
the
single
dominant
purpose
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
there
was
definiteness
as
well
as
breadth
in
her
way
of
working
all
through
her
life
i
wish
i
could
remember
exactly
what
was
said
by
that
critical
circle
for
there
were
some
quick
and
brilliant
minds
and
some
pungent
powers
of
appreciation
and
some
young
women
in
that
group
perhaps
i
might
say
they
had
all
felt
the
moulding
force
of
some
very
original
and
potential
educators
as
they
had
been
growing
up
into
their
young
womanhood
some
of
these
were
professional
educators
of
lasting
others
were
not
professed
teachers
yet
in
the
truest
and
broadest
sense
teachers
of
very
wide
and
wise
and
inspiring
influence
and
of
these
thomas
wentworth
higginson
had
come
more
intimately
and
effectually
into
formative
relations
with
the
minds
and
characters
of
those
gathered
in
that
sunny
room
than
any
other
person
they
certainly
owed
much
of
the
loftiness
and
breadth
of
their
aim
in
life
and
their
comprehension
of
the
growth
and
work
to
be
accomplished
in
the
world
to
his
kind
and
steady
instigation
i
wish
i
could
remember
what
they
said
and
what
jane
said
but
all
that
has
passed
away
i
think
somebody
objected
to
the
length
of
the
title
which
jane
admitted
to
be
a
fault
but
said
something
of
wishing
to
get
the
idea
of
the
unity
of
the
world
into
it
as
the
main
idea
of
the
book
i
only
recall
the
enthusiastic
delight
with
which
chapter
after
chapter
was
greeted
we
declared
that
it
was
a
fairy
tale
of
geography
and
a
work
of
genius
in
its
whole
conception
and
in
its
absorbing
interest
of
detail
and
individuality
and
that
any
publisher
would
demonstrate
himself
an
idiot
who
did
not
want
to
publish
it
i
remember
jane
quick
tossing
back
of
the
head
and
puzzled
brow
which
broke
into
a
laugh
as
she
said
well
girls
it
ca
be
as
good
as
you
say
there
must
be
some
faults
in
it
but
we
all
exclaimed
that
we
had
done
our
prettiest
at
finding
fault
that
there
was
a
ghost
of
a
fault
in
it
for
the
incarnate
beauty
and
ideality
and
truthfulness
of
her
little
stories
had
melted
into
our
being
and
left
us
spellbound
till
we
were
one
with
each
other
and
her
one
with
the
seven
little
sisters
too
and
they
seemed
like
our
very
own
little
sisters
so
they
have
rested
in
our
imagination
and
affection
as
we
have
seen
them
grow
into
the
imagination
and
affection
of
generations
of
children
since
and
as
they
will
continue
to
grow
until
the
old
limitations
and
barrenness
of
the
study
of
geography
shall
be
transfigured
and
the
earth
seem
to
the
children
an
eden
which
love
has
girdled
when
gemila
agoonack
and
the
others
shall
have
won
them
to
a
knowledge
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
the
fatherhood
of
god
i
would
like
to
bring
before
young
people
who
have
read
her
books
some
qualities
of
her
mind
and
character
which
made
her
the
rare
woman
teacher
and
writer
that
she
was
i
knew
her
from
early
girlhood
we
went
to
the
same
schools
in
more
and
more
intimate
companionship
from
the
time
we
were
twelve
until
we
were
twenty
years
of
age
and
our
lives
and
hearts
were
grappled
to
each
other
with
links
of
steel
ever
after
she
was
a
precocious
child
early
matured
and
strong
in
intellectual
and
emotional
experiences
she
had
a
remarkably
clear
mind
orderly
and
logical
in
its
processes
and
loved
to
take
up
hard
problems
she
studied
all
her
life
with
great
joy
and
earnestness
rarely
if
ever
baffled
in
her
persistent
learning
except
by
she
went
on
at
a
great
pace
in
mathematics
for
a
young
girl
every
step
seemed
easy
to
her
she
took
everything
severe
that
she
could
get
a
chance
at
in
the
course
or
out
of
it
surveying
navigation
mechanics
mathematical
astronomy
and
conic
sections
as
well
as
the
ordinary
course
in
mathematics
the
calculus
she
had
worked
through
at
sixteen
under
a
very
able
and
exact
teacher
and
took
her
diploma
from
wells
a
master
who
allowed
nothing
to
go
slipshod
she
was
absorbed
in
studies
of
this
kind
and
took
no
especial
interest
in
composition
or
literature
beyond
what
was
required
and
what
was
the
natural
outcome
of
a
literary
atmosphere
and
inherited
culture
that
is
her
mind
was
passively
rather
than
actively
engaged
in
such
directions
until
later
at
the
normal
school
she
led
a
class
which
has
had
a
proud
intellectual
record
as
teachers
and
workers
she
was
the
easy
victor
in
every
contest
with
an
inclusive
grasp
an
incisive
analysis
instant
generalization
a
very
tenacious
and
ready
memory
and
unusual
talent
for
every
effort
of
study
she
took
and
held
the
first
place
as
a
matter
of
course
until
she
graduated
when
she
gave
the
valedictory
address
this
valedictory
was
a
prophetic
note
in
the
line
of
her
future
expression
for
it
gave
a
graphic
illustration
of
the
art
of
teaching
geography
to
the
consideration
of
which
she
had
been
led
by
miss
crocker
logical
suggestive
and
masterly
presentation
of
the
subject
in
the
school
course
her
ability
and
steadiness
of
working
power
as
well
as
singleness
of
aim
attracted
the
attention
of
horace
mann
who
was
about
forming
the
nucleus
of
antioch
college
and
he
succeeded
in
gaining
her
as
one
of
his
promised
new
england
recruits
she
had
attended
very
little
to
latin
and
went
to
work
at
once
to
prepare
for
the
classical
requirements
of
a
college
examination
this
she
did
with
such
phenomenal
rapidity
that
in
six
weeks
she
had
fitted
herself
for
what
was
probably
equivalent
to
a
harvard
entrance
examination
in
latin
she
went
to
antioch
and
taught
as
well
as
studied
for
a
while
until
her
health
gave
way
entirely
and
she
was
prostrate
for
years
with
brain
and
spine
disorders
of
course
this
put
an
end
to
her
college
career
and
on
her
recovery
she
opened
her
little
school
in
her
own
house
which
she
held
together
until
her
final
illness
and
to
which
she
devoted
her
thoughts
and
energies
her
endowments
and
attainments
as
well
as
her
prodigal
devotion
and
love
the
success
of
the
seven
little
sisters
was
a
great
pleasure
to
her
partly
because
her
dear
mother
and
friends
were
so
thoroughly
satisfied
with
it
her
mother
always
wished
that
jane
would
give
her
time
more
exclusively
to
writing
especially
as
new
outlines
of
literary
work
were
constantly
aroused
in
her
active
brain
she
wrote
several
stories
which
were
careful
studies
in
natural
science
and
which
appeared
in
some
of
the
magazines
i
am
sure
they
would
be
well
worth
collecting
she
had
her
plan
of
each
and
all
long
in
her
mind
before
elaborating
and
it
crystallized
by
actual
contact
with
the
needs
and
the
intellectual
instincts
of
her
little
classes
in
fact
all
her
books
grew
like
a
plant
from
within
outwards
they
were
born
in
the
nursery
of
the
schoolroom
and
nurtured
by
the
suggestions
of
the
children
interest
thus
blooming
in
the
garden
of
a
true
and
natural
education
the
last
book
she
wrote
ten
boys
who
lived
on
the
road
from
long
ago
to
now
she
had
had
in
her
mind
for
years
this
little
book
she
dedicated
to
a
son
of
her
sister
margaret
i
am
sure
she
gave
me
an
outline
of
the
plan
fully
ten
years
before
she
wrote
it
out
the
subject
of
her
mental
work
lay
in
her
mind
growing
gathering
to
itself
nourishment
and
organizing
itself
consciously
or
unconsciously
by
all
the
forces
of
her
unresting
brain
and
all
the
channels
of
her
study
until
it
sprung
from
her
pen
complete
at
a
stroke
she
wrote
good
english
of
course
and
would
never
sentimentalize
but
went
directly
at
the
pith
of
the
matter
and
if
she
had
few
thoughts
on
a
subject
she
made
but
few
words
i
think
she
did
much
by
way
of
revising
or
recasting
after
her
thought
was
once
committed
to
paper
i
think
she
wrote
it
as
she
would
have
said
it
always
with
an
imaginary
child
before
her
to
whose
intelligence
and
sympathy
it
was
addressed
her
habit
of
mind
was
to
complete
a
thought
before
any
attempt
to
convey
it
to
others
this
made
her
a
very
helpful
and
clear
teacher
and
leader
she
seemed
always
to
have
considered
carefully
anything
she
talked
about
and
gave
her
opinion
with
a
deliberation
and
clear
conviction
which
affected
others
as
a
verdict
and
made
her
an
oracle
to
a
great
many
kinds
of
people
all
her
plans
were
thoroughly
shaped
before
execution
all
her
work
was
true
finished
and
conscientious
in
every
department
she
did
a
great
deal
of
quiet
systematic
thinking
from
her
early
school
days
onward
and
was
never
satisfied
until
she
completed
the
act
of
thought
by
expression
and
manifestation
in
some
way
for
the
advantage
of
others
the
last
time
i
saw
her
which
was
for
less
than
five
minutes
accorded
me
by
her
nurse
during
her
last
illness
she
spoke
of
a
new
plan
of
literary
work
which
she
had
in
mind
and
although
she
attempted
no
delineation
of
it
said
she
was
thinking
it
out
whenever
she
felt
that
it
was
safe
for
her
to
think
her
active
brain
never
ceased
its
plans
for
others
for
working
toward
the
illumination
of
the
mind
the
purification
of
the
soul
and
the
elevation
and
broadening
of
all
the
ideals
of
life
i
remember
her
sitting
absorbed
in
reflection
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
every
evening
while
we
were
at
the
house
beautiful
of
the
peabodys
we
spent
nearly
all
our
time
at
west
newton
in
a
little
cottage
on
the
hill
where
miss
elizabeth
peabody
with
her
saintly
mother
and
father
made
a
paradise
of
love
and
refinement
and
ideal
culture
for
us
and
where
we
often
met
the
hawthornes
and
manns
and
we
shall
never
be
able
to
measure
the
wealth
of
intangible
mental
and
spiritual
influence
which
we
received
therefrom
at
west
newton
or
when
at
home
gazing
every
night
before
retiring
from
her
own
standing
at
her
watchtower
to
commune
with
the
starry
heavens
and
receive
that
exaltation
of
spirit
which
is
communicated
when
we
yield
ourselves
to
the
essentially
religious
i
use
this
phrase
because
it
delighted
her
so
when
i
repeated
it
to
her
as
the
saying
of
a
child
in
looking
at
the
stars
no
one
ever
felt
a
twinge
of
jealousy
in
jane
easy
supremacy
she
never
made
a
fuss
about
it
although
i
think
she
had
no
mock
modesty
in
the
matter
she
accepted
the
situation
which
her
uniform
correctness
of
judgment
assured
to
her
while
she
always
accorded
generous
praise
and
deference
to
those
who
excelled
her
in
departments
where
she
made
no
pretence
of
superiority
there
were
some
occasions
when
her
idea
of
duty
differed
from
a
conventional
one
perhaps
from
that
of
some
of
her
near
friends
but
no
one
ever
doubted
her
strict
dealing
with
herself
or
her
singleness
of
motive
she
did
not
feel
the
need
of
turning
to
any
other
conscience
than
her
own
for
support
or
enlightenment
and
was
inflexible
and
unwavering
in
any
course
she
deemed
right
she
never
apologized
for
herself
in
any
way
or
referred
a
matter
of
her
own
experience
or
sole
responsibility
to
another
for
decision
neither
did
she
seem
to
feel
the
need
of
expressed
sympathy
in
any
private
loss
or
trial
her
philosophy
of
life
her
faith
or
her
temperament
seemed
equal
to
every
exigency
of
disappointment
or
suffering
she
generally
kept
her
personal
trials
hidden
within
her
own
heart
and
recovered
from
every
selfish
pain
by
the
elastic
vigor
of
her
power
for
unselfish
devotion
to
the
good
of
others
she
said
that
happiness
was
to
have
an
unselfish
work
to
do
and
the
power
to
do
it
it
has
been
said
that
jane
only
fault
was
that
she
was
too
good
i
think
she
carried
her
unselfishness
too
often
to
a
excess
breaking
down
her
health
and
thus
abridging
her
opportunities
for
more
permanent
advantage
to
those
whom
she
would
have
died
to
serve
but
it
was
solely
on
her
own
responsibility
and
in
consequence
of
her
accumulative
energy
of
temperament
that
made
her
unconscious
of
the
strain
until
too
late
her
brain
was
constitutionally
sensitive
and
almost
abnormally
active
and
she
more
than
once
overtaxed
it
by
too
continuous
study
or
by
a
disregard
of
its
laws
of
health
or
by
a
stupendous
multiplicity
of
cares
some
of
which
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
to
others
she
took
everybody
burdens
to
carry
herself
she
was
absorbed
in
the
affairs
of
those
she
loved
of
her
home
circle
of
her
families
and
of
many
a
needy
one
whom
she
adopted
into
her
solicitude
she
was
thoroughly
fond
of
children
and
of
all
that
they
say
and
do
and
would
work
her
fingers
off
for
them
or
nurse
them
day
and
night
her
sisters
children
were
as
if
they
had
been
her
own
and
she
revelled
in
all
their
wonderful
manifestations
and
development
her
friends
children
she
always
cared
deeply
for
and
was
hungry
for
their
wise
and
funny
remarks
or
any
hint
of
their
individuality
many
of
these
things
she
remembered
longer
than
the
mothers
themselves
and
took
the
most
thorough
satisfaction
in
recounting
i
have
often
visited
her
school
and
it
seemed
like
a
home
with
a
mother
in
it
there
we
took
sweet
counsel
together
as
if
we
had
come
to
the
house
of
god
in
company
for
our
methods
were
identical
and
a
day
in
her
school
was
a
day
in
mine
we
invariably
agreed
as
to
the
ends
of
the
work
and
how
to
reach
them
for
we
understood
each
other
perfectly
in
that
field
of
art
i
wish
i
could
show
her
life
with
all
its
constituent
factors
of
ancestry
home
and
surroundings
for
they
were
so
inherent
in
her
thoughts
and
feelings
that
you
could
hardly
separate
her
from
them
in
your
consideration
but
that
is
impossible
disinterested
benevolence
was
the
native
air
of
the
house
into
which
she
was
born
and
she
was
an
embodiment
of
that
idea
to
devote
herself
to
some
poor
outcast
to
reform
a
distorted
soul
to
give
all
she
had
to
the
most
abject
to
do
all
she
could
for
the
despised
and
rejected
this
was
her
craving
and
absorbing
desire
i
remember
some
comical
instances
of
the
pursuance
of
this
where
the
returns
were
to
say
the
least
disappointing
but
she
was
never
discouraged
it
would
be
easy
to
name
many
who
received
a
lifelong
stimulus
and
aid
at
her
hands
either
intellectual
or
moral
she
had
much
to
do
with
the
development
of
some
remarkable
careers
as
well
as
with
the
regeneration
of
many
poor
and
abandoned
souls
she
was
in
the
lives
of
her
dear
ones
and
they
in
hers
to
a
very
unusual
degree
and
her
are
twined
inextricably
in
theirs
forever
she
was
a
complete
woman
brain
will
affections
all
to
the
greatest
extent
active
and
unselfish
her
character
was
a
harmony
of
many
strong
and
diverse
elements
her
conscience
was
a
great
rock
upon
which
her
whole
nature
rested
her
hands
were
deft
and
cunning
her
ingenious
brain
was
like
a
master
mechanic
at
expedients
and
in
executive
and
administrative
power
as
well
as
in
device
and
comprehension
she
was
a
marvel
if
she
had
faults
they
are
indistinguishable
in
the
brightness
and
solidity
of
her
whole
character
she
was
ready
to
move
into
her
place
in
any
sphere
and
adjust
herself
to
any
work
god
should
give
her
to
do
she
must
be
happy
and
shedding
happiness
wherever
she
is
for
that
is
an
inseparable
quality
and
function
of
her
identity
she
passed
calmly
out
of
this
life
and
lay
at
rest
in
her
own
home
in
that
dear
room
so
full
of
memories
of
her
presence
with
flowers
to
deck
her
bed
and
many
of
her
dearest
friends
around
her
while
the
verses
which
her
beloved
sister
caroline
had
selected
seemed
easily
to
speak
with
jane
own
voice
as
they
read
prepare
the
house
kind
friends
drape
it
and
deck
it
with
leaves
and
blossoms
fair
throw
open
doors
and
windows
and
call
hither
the
sunshine
and
soft
air
let
all
the
house
from
floor
to
ceiling
look
its
noblest
and
its
best
for
it
may
chance
that
soon
may
come
to
me
a
most
imperial
guest
a
prouder
visitor
than
ever
yet
has
crossed
my
threshold
one
wearing
royal
sceptre
and
a
crown
shall
enter
at
my
door
shall
deign
perchance
sit
at
my
board
an
hour
and
break
with
me
my
bread
suffer
perchance
this
night
my
honored
roof
shelter
his
kingly
head
and
if
ere
comes
the
sun
again
he
bid
me
arise
without
delay
and
follow
him
a
journey
to
his
kingdom
unknown
and
far
away
and
in
the
gray
light
of
the
dawning
morn
we
pass
from
out
my
door
my
guest
and
i
silent
without
farewell
and
to
return
no
more
weep
not
kind
friends
i
pray
not
with
vain
tears
let
your
glad
eyes
grow
dim
remember
that
my
house
was
all
prepared
and
that
i
welcomed
him
the
seven
little
sisters
the
ball
itself
dear
children
i
have
heard
of
a
wonderful
ball
which
floats
in
the
sweet
blue
air
and
has
little
soft
white
clouds
about
it
as
it
swims
along
there
are
many
charming
and
astonishing
things
to
be
told
of
this
ball
and
some
of
them
you
shall
hear
in
the
first
place
you
must
know
that
it
is
a
very
big
ball
far
bigger
than
the
great
soft
ball
of
bright
colors
that
little
charley
plays
with
on
the
floor
yes
indeed
and
bigger
than
cousin
largest
football
that
he
brought
home
from
college
in
the
spring
bigger
too
than
that
fine
round
globe
in
the
schoolroom
that
emma
turns
about
so
carefully
while
she
twists
her
bright
face
all
into
wrinkles
as
she
searches
for
afghanistan
or
the
bosphorus
straits
long
names
indeed
they
sound
quite
grand
from
her
little
mouth
but
they
mean
nothing
to
you
and
me
now
let
me
tell
you
about
ball
it
is
so
large
that
trees
can
grow
on
it
so
large
that
cattle
can
graze
and
wild
beasts
roam
upon
it
so
large
that
men
and
women
can
live
on
it
and
little
children
too
as
you
already
know
if
you
have
read
the
of
this
book
in
some
places
it
is
soft
and
green
like
the
long
meadow
between
the
hills
where
the
grass
was
so
high
last
summer
that
we
almost
lost
marnie
when
she
lay
down
to
roll
in
it
in
some
parts
it
is
covered
with
tall
and
thick
forests
where
you
might
wander
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
nor
ever
find
your
way
out
then
again
it
is
steep
and
rough
covered
with
great
hills
much
higher
than
that
high
one
behind
the
schoolhouse
so
high
that
when
you
look
up
ever
so
far
you
see
the
tops
of
them
but
in
some
parts
there
are
no
hills
at
all
and
quiet
little
ponds
of
blue
water
where
the
white
grow
and
silvery
fishes
play
among
their
long
stems
bell
knows
for
she
has
been
among
the
lilies
in
a
boat
with
papa
now
if
we
look
on
another
side
of
the
ball
we
shall
see
no
ponds
but
something
very
dreary
i
am
afraid
you
wo
like
it
a
great
plain
of
sand
sand
like
that
on
the
seashore
only
here
there
is
no
sea
and
the
sand
stretches
away
farther
than
you
can
see
on
every
side
there
are
no
trees
and
the
sunshine
beats
down
almost
burning
whatever
is
beneath
it
perhaps
you
think
this
would
be
a
grand
place
to
build
one
of
the
little
sisters
lives
here
and
when
you
read
of
her
you
will
know
what
she
thinks
about
it
always
the
one
who
has
tried
it
knows
best
look
at
one
more
side
of
my
ball
as
it
turns
around
jack
frost
must
have
spent
all
his
longest
winter
nights
here
for
see
what
a
palace
of
ice
he
has
built
for
himself
brave
men
have
gone
to
those
lonely
places
to
come
back
and
tell
us
about
them
and
alas
some
heroes
have
not
returned
but
have
lain
down
there
to
perish
of
cold
and
hunger
does
it
look
cold
the
clear
blue
ice
almost
as
blue
as
the
air
and
look
at
the
snow
drifts
upon
drifts
and
the
air
filled
with
feathery
flakes
even
now
we
wo
look
at
this
side
longer
but
we
shall
come
back
again
to
see
agoonack
in
her
little
sledge
do
turn
over
yet
to
find
the
story
we
shall
come
to
it
all
in
good
time
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
ball
so
white
and
cold
so
soft
and
green
so
quiet
and
blue
so
dreary
and
rough
as
it
floats
along
in
the
sweet
blue
air
with
the
flocks
of
white
clouds
about
it
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
more
the
wise
men
have
said
that
this
earth
on
which
we
live
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
just
such
a
ball
of
this
we
shall
know
when
we
are
older
and
wiser
but
here
is
the
little
brown
baby
waiting
for
us
the
little
brown
baby
far
away
in
the
warm
country
lives
a
little
brown
baby
she
has
a
brown
face
little
brown
hands
and
fingers
brown
body
arms
and
legs
and
even
her
little
toes
are
also
brown
and
this
baby
wears
no
little
frock
nor
apron
no
little
petticoat
nor
even
stockings
and
shoes
nothing
at
all
but
a
string
of
beads
around
her
neck
as
you
wear
your
coral
for
the
sun
shines
very
warmly
there
and
she
needs
no
clothes
to
keep
her
from
the
cold
her
hair
is
straight
and
black
hanging
softly
down
each
side
of
her
small
brown
face
nothing
at
all
like
bell
golden
curls
or
sunny
brown
ones
would
you
like
to
know
how
she
lives
among
the
flowers
and
the
birds
she
rolls
in
the
long
soft
grass
where
the
snakes
are
at
play
she
watches
the
young
monkeys
chattering
and
swinging
among
the
trees
hung
by
the
tail
she
chases
the
splendid
green
parrots
that
fly
among
the
trees
and
she
drinks
the
sweet
milk
of
the
cocoanut
from
a
round
cup
made
of
its
shell
when
night
comes
the
mother
takes
her
baby
and
tosses
her
up
into
the
little
swinging
bed
in
the
tree
which
her
father
made
for
her
from
the
twisting
vine
that
climbs
among
the
branches
and
the
wind
blows
and
rocks
the
little
bed
and
the
mother
sits
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
singing
a
mild
sweet
song
and
this
brown
baby
falls
asleep
then
the
stars
come
out
and
peep
through
the
leaves
at
her
the
birds
too
are
all
asleep
in
the
tree
the
spreading
her
wings
over
the
young
ones
in
the
nest
and
the
sitting
on
a
twig
close
by
with
his
head
under
his
wing
even
the
chattering
monkey
has
curled
himself
up
for
the
night
soon
the
large
round
moon
comes
up
she
too
must
look
into
the
swinging
bed
and
shine
upon
the
closed
eyes
of
the
little
brown
baby
she
is
very
gentle
and
sends
her
soft
light
among
the
branches
and
thick
green
leaves
kissing
tenderly
the
small
brown
feet
and
the
crest
on
the
head
of
the
who
opens
one
eye
and
looks
quickly
about
to
see
if
any
harm
is
coming
to
the
young
ones
the
bright
little
stars
too
twinkle
down
through
the
shadows
to
bless
the
sleeping
child
all
this
while
the
wind
blows
and
rocks
the
little
bed
singing
also
a
low
song
through
the
trees
for
the
brown
mother
has
fallen
asleep
herself
and
left
the
to
take
care
of
her
baby
so
the
night
moves
on
until
all
at
once
the
rosy
dawn
breaks
over
the
earth
the
birds
lift
up
their
heads
and
sing
and
sing
the
great
round
sun
springs
up
and
shining
into
the
tree
lifts
the
shut
lids
of
the
brown
baby
eyes
she
rolls
over
and
falls
into
her
arms
who
dips
her
into
the
pretty
running
brook
for
a
bath
and
rolls
her
in
the
grass
to
dry
and
then
she
may
play
among
the
birds
and
flowers
all
day
long
for
they
are
like
merry
brothers
and
sisters
to
the
happy
child
and
she
plays
with
them
on
the
bosom
of
the
round
earth
which
seems
to
love
them
all
like
a
mother
this
is
the
little
brown
baby
do
you
love
her
do
you
think
you
would
know
her
if
you
should
meet
her
some
day
a
funny
little
brown
sister
are
all
of
them
brown
we
will
see
for
here
comes
agoonack
and
her
sledge
agoonack
the
esquimau
sister
what
is
this
mound
of
stone
it
looks
like
the
great
brick
oven
that
used
to
be
in
our
old
kitchen
where
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
saw
the
fine
large
loaves
of
bread
and
the
pies
and
puddings
pushed
carefully
in
with
a
long
flat
shovel
or
drawn
out
with
the
same
when
the
heat
had
browned
them
nicely
is
this
an
oven
standing
out
here
alone
in
the
snow
you
will
laugh
when
i
tell
you
that
it
is
not
an
oven
but
a
house
and
here
lives
little
agoonack
do
you
see
that
low
opening
close
to
the
ground
that
is
the
door
but
one
must
creep
on
hands
and
knees
to
enter
there
is
another
smaller
hole
above
the
door
it
is
the
window
it
has
no
glass
as
ours
do
only
a
thin
covering
of
something
which
agoonack
father
took
from
the
inside
of
a
seal
and
her
mother
stretched
over
the
to
keep
out
the
cold
and
to
let
in
a
little
light
here
lives
our
little
girl
not
as
the
brown
baby
does
among
the
trees
and
the
flowers
but
far
up
in
the
cold
countries
amid
snow
and
ice
if
we
look
off
now
over
the
ice
we
shall
see
a
funny
little
clumsy
thing
running
along
as
fast
as
its
short
stout
legs
will
permit
trying
to
keep
up
with
its
mother
you
will
hardly
know
it
to
be
a
little
girl
but
might
rather
call
it
a
white
bear
cub
it
is
so
oddly
dressed
in
the
white
shaggy
coat
of
the
bear
which
its
father
killed
last
month
but
this
is
really
agoonack
you
can
see
her
round
fat
greasy
little
face
if
you
throw
back
the
white
which
covers
her
head
shall
i
tell
you
what
clothes
she
wears
not
at
all
like
yours
you
will
say
but
when
one
lives
in
cold
countries
one
must
dress
accordingly
first
she
has
socks
soft
and
warm
but
not
knit
of
the
white
yarn
with
which
mamma
knits
yours
her
mamma
has
sewed
them
from
the
skins
of
birds
with
the
soft
down
upon
them
to
keep
the
small
brown
feet
very
warm
over
these
come
her
moccasins
of
sealskin
if
you
have
been
on
the
seashore
perhaps
you
know
the
seals
that
are
sometimes
seen
swimming
in
the
sea
holding
up
their
brown
heads
which
look
much
like
dogs
heads
wet
and
dripping
the
seals
love
best
to
live
in
the
seas
of
the
cold
countries
here
they
are
huddled
together
on
the
sloping
rocky
shores
or
swimming
about
under
the
ice
thousands
and
thousands
of
coated
creatures
gentle
and
brave
fathers
with
all
their
pretty
and
here
the
esquimaux
for
that
is
the
name
by
which
we
call
these
people
of
the
cold
countries
hunt
them
eat
them
for
dinner
and
make
warm
clothes
of
their
skins
so
as
i
told
you
agoonack
has
sealskin
boots
next
she
wears
leggings
or
trousers
of
white
very
rough
and
shaggy
and
a
little
jacket
or
frock
called
a
jumper
of
the
same
this
jumper
has
a
hood
made
like
the
little
red
which
i
dare
say
you
have
all
seen
pull
the
hood
up
over
the
short
black
hair
letting
it
almost
hide
the
fat
round
face
and
you
have
agoonack
dressed
is
this
her
best
dress
do
you
think
certainly
it
is
her
best
because
she
has
no
other
and
when
she
goes
into
the
house
but
i
think
i
wo
tell
you
that
yet
for
there
is
something
more
to
be
seen
outside
agoonack
and
her
mother
are
coming
home
to
dinner
but
there
is
no
sun
shining
on
the
snow
to
make
it
sparkle
it
is
dark
like
night
and
the
stars
shine
clear
and
steady
like
silver
lamps
in
the
sky
but
far
off
between
the
great
icy
peaks
strange
lights
are
dancing
shooting
long
rosy
flames
far
into
the
sky
or
marching
in
troops
as
if
each
light
had
a
life
of
its
own
and
all
were
marching
together
along
the
dark
quiet
sky
now
they
move
slowly
and
solemnly
with
no
noise
and
in
regular
steady
file
then
they
rush
all
together
flame
into
golden
and
rosy
streamers
and
mount
far
above
the
cold
icy
mountain
peaks
that
glitter
in
their
light
we
hear
a
sharp
sound
like
dsah
dsah
and
the
ice
glows
with
the
warm
color
and
the
splendor
shines
on
the
little
girl
as
she
trots
beside
her
mother
it
is
far
more
beautiful
than
the
fireworks
on
fourth
of
july
sometimes
we
see
a
little
of
it
here
and
we
say
there
are
northern
lights
and
we
sit
at
the
window
watching
all
the
evening
to
see
them
march
and
turn
and
flash
but
in
the
cold
countries
they
are
far
more
brilliant
than
any
we
have
seen
illustration
it
is
agoonack
birthday
and
there
is
a
present
for
her
before
the
door
of
the
house
i
will
make
you
a
picture
of
it
it
is
a
sled
you
exclaim
yes
a
sled
but
quite
unlike
yours
in
the
faraway
cold
countries
no
trees
grow
so
her
father
had
no
wood
and
he
took
the
bones
of
the
walrus
and
the
whale
bound
them
together
with
strips
of
sealskin
and
he
has
built
this
pretty
sled
for
his
little
birthday
it
has
a
back
to
lean
against
and
hold
by
for
the
child
will
go
over
some
very
rough
places
and
might
easily
fall
from
it
and
then
you
see
if
she
fell
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
to
jump
up
again
and
climb
back
to
her
seat
for
the
little
sled
would
have
run
away
from
her
before
she
should
have
time
to
pick
herself
up
how
could
it
run
yes
that
is
the
wonderful
thing
about
it
when
her
father
made
the
sled
he
said
to
himself
by
the
time
this
is
finished
the
two
little
brown
dogs
will
be
old
enough
to
draw
it
and
agoonack
shall
have
them
for
she
is
a
princess
the
daughter
of
a
great
chief
now
you
can
see
that
with
two
such
brisk
little
dogs
as
the
brown
puppies
harnessed
to
the
sled
agoonack
must
keep
her
seat
firmly
that
she
may
not
roll
over
into
the
snow
and
let
the
dogs
run
away
with
it
you
can
imagine
what
gay
frolics
she
has
with
her
brother
who
runs
at
her
side
or
how
she
laughs
and
shouts
to
see
him
drive
his
bone
ball
with
his
bone
bat
or
hockey
skimming
it
over
the
crusty
snow
now
we
will
creep
into
the
low
house
with
the
child
and
her
mother
and
see
how
they
live
outside
it
is
very
cold
colder
than
you
have
ever
known
it
to
be
in
the
coldest
winter
day
but
inside
it
is
warm
even
very
hot
and
the
first
thing
agoonack
and
her
mother
do
is
to
take
off
their
clothes
for
here
it
is
as
warm
as
the
place
where
the
brown
baby
lives
who
needs
no
clothes
it
is
the
sunshine
that
makes
it
warm
for
you
remember
i
told
you
it
was
as
dark
as
night
there
is
no
furnace
in
the
cellar
indeed
there
is
no
cellar
neither
is
there
a
stove
but
all
this
heat
comes
from
a
sort
of
lamp
with
long
wicks
of
moss
and
plenty
of
walrus
fat
to
burn
it
warms
the
small
house
which
has
but
one
room
and
over
it
the
mother
hangs
a
shallow
dish
in
which
she
cooks
soup
but
most
of
the
meat
is
eaten
raw
cut
into
long
strips
and
eaten
much
as
one
might
eat
a
stick
of
candy
they
have
no
bread
no
crackers
no
apples
nor
potatoes
nothing
but
meat
and
sometimes
the
milk
of
the
reindeer
for
there
are
no
cows
in
the
far
cold
northern
countries
but
the
reindeer
gives
them
a
great
deal
he
is
their
horse
as
well
as
their
cow
his
skin
and
his
flesh
his
bones
and
horns
are
useful
when
he
is
dead
and
while
he
lives
he
is
their
kind
gentle
and
patient
friend
there
is
some
one
else
in
the
hut
when
agoonack
comes
home
a
little
dark
ball
rolled
up
on
one
corner
of
the
stone
platform
which
is
built
all
around
three
sides
of
the
house
serving
for
seats
beds
and
table
this
ball
unrolls
itself
tumbles
off
the
seat
and
runs
to
meet
them
it
is
sipsu
the
baby
brother
of
agoonack
a
round
little
boy
who
rides
sometimes
when
the
weather
is
not
too
cold
in
the
hood
of
his
mother
jumper
hanging
at
her
back
and
peering
out
from
his
warm
over
the
long
icy
plain
to
watch
for
his
father
return
from
the
when
the
men
come
home
dragging
the
great
nannook
as
they
call
the
bear
there
is
a
merry
feast
they
crowd
together
in
the
hut
bringing
in
a
great
block
of
snow
which
they
put
over
the
to
melt
into
water
and
then
they
cut
long
strips
of
bear
meat
and
laugh
and
eat
and
sing
as
they
tell
the
long
story
of
the
hunt
of
nannook
and
the
seals
they
have
seen
and
the
of
the
reindeer
they
have
met
in
the
long
valley
perhaps
the
day
will
come
when
pale
tired
travellers
will
come
to
their
sheltering
home
and
tell
them
wonderful
stories
and
share
their
warmth
for
a
while
till
they
can
gain
strength
to
go
on
their
journey
again
perhaps
while
they
are
so
merry
there
all
together
a
very
great
snowstorm
will
come
and
cover
the
little
house
so
that
they
can
not
get
out
for
several
days
when
the
storm
ends
they
dig
out
the
low
doorway
and
creep
again
into
the
starlight
and
agoonack
slips
into
her
warm
clothes
and
runs
out
for
jack
frost
to
kiss
her
cheeks
and
leave
roses
wherever
his
lips
touch
if
it
is
very
cold
indeed
she
must
stay
in
or
jack
frost
will
give
her
no
roses
but
a
cold
frosty
bite
this
is
the
way
agoonack
lives
through
the
long
darkness
but
i
have
to
tell
you
more
of
her
in
another
chapter
and
you
will
find
it
is
not
always
dark
in
the
cold
northern
countries
how
agoonack
lives
through
the
long
summer
it
is
almost
noon
one
day
when
agoonack
mother
wraps
the
little
girl
in
her
shaggy
clothes
and
climbs
with
her
a
high
hill
promising
a
pleasant
sight
when
they
shall
have
reached
the
top
it
is
the
sun
the
beautiful
bright
round
sun
which
shines
and
smiles
at
them
for
a
minute
and
then
slips
away
again
below
the
far
frozen
water
they
have
seen
him
for
many
months
and
now
they
rejoice
for
the
next
day
he
comes
again
and
stays
longer
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
every
day
longer
and
longer
until
at
last
he
moves
above
them
in
one
great
bright
circle
and
does
not
even
go
away
at
all
at
night
his
warm
rays
melt
the
snow
and
awaken
the
few
little
hardy
flowers
that
can
grow
in
this
short
summer
the
icy
coat
breaks
away
from
the
clear
running
water
and
great
flocks
of
birds
with
soft
white
plumage
come
like
a
snowstorm
of
great
feathery
flakes
and
settle
among
the
black
rocks
along
the
seashore
here
they
lay
their
eggs
in
the
many
safe
little
corners
and
shelves
of
the
rock
and
here
they
circle
about
in
the
sunshine
while
the
esquimau
boys
make
ready
their
nets
and
creep
and
climb
out
upon
the
ledges
of
rock
and
holding
up
the
net
as
the
birds
fly
by
catch
a
netful
to
carry
home
for
supper
the
sun
shines
all
day
long
and
all
night
long
too
and
yet
he
ca
melt
all
the
highest
snowdrifts
where
the
boys
are
playing
long
bones
for
sticks
and
an
odd
little
round
one
for
a
ball
it
is
a
merry
life
they
all
live
while
the
sunshine
stays
for
they
know
the
long
dark
winter
is
coming
when
they
can
no
longer
climb
among
the
birds
nor
play
ball
among
the
drifts
the
seals
swim
by
in
the
clear
water
and
the
walrus
and
her
young
one
are
at
play
and
best
of
all
the
good
reindeer
has
come
for
the
sun
has
uncovered
the
crisp
moss
upon
which
he
feeds
and
he
is
roaming
through
the
valleys
where
it
grows
among
the
rocks
the
old
men
sit
on
the
rocks
in
the
sunshine
and
laugh
and
sing
and
tell
long
stories
of
the
whale
and
the
seal
and
the
great
white
whale
that
many
years
ago
when
agoonack
father
was
a
child
came
swimming
down
from
the
far
north
where
they
look
for
the
northern
lights
swimming
and
diving
through
the
broken
ice
and
they
watched
her
in
wonder
and
no
one
would
throw
a
harpoon
at
this
white
lady
of
the
greenland
seas
for
her
visit
was
a
good
omen
promising
a
mild
winter
little
agoonack
comes
from
her
play
to
crouch
among
the
rocky
ledges
and
listen
to
the
stories
she
has
no
books
and
if
she
had
she
could
read
them
neither
could
her
father
or
mother
read
to
her
their
stories
are
told
and
sung
but
never
written
but
she
is
a
cheerful
and
contented
little
girl
and
tries
to
help
her
dear
friends
and
sometimes
she
wonders
a
great
while
by
herself
about
what
the
pale
stranger
told
them
and
now
day
by
day
the
sun
is
slipping
away
from
them
gone
for
a
few
minutes
it
will
stay
away
a
few
more
until
at
last
there
are
many
hours
of
rosy
twilight
and
few
very
few
of
clear
sunshine
but
the
children
are
happy
they
do
not
dread
the
winter
but
they
hope
the
tired
travellers
have
reached
their
homes
and
agoonack
wants
oh
so
much
to
see
them
and
help
them
once
more
the
father
will
hunt
again
and
the
mother
will
tend
the
lamp
and
keep
the
house
warm
and
although
they
will
have
no
sun
the
moon
and
stars
are
bright
and
they
will
see
again
the
streamers
of
the
great
northern
light
would
you
like
to
live
in
the
cold
countries
with
their
long
darkness
and
long
sunshine
it
is
very
cold
to
be
sure
but
there
are
happy
children
there
and
kind
fathers
and
mothers
and
the
merriest
sliding
on
the
very
best
of
ice
and
snow
gemila
the
child
of
the
desert
it
is
almost
sunset
and
abdel
hassan
has
come
out
to
the
door
of
his
tent
to
enjoy
the
breeze
which
is
growing
cooler
after
the
terrible
heat
the
round
red
sun
hangs
low
over
the
sand
it
will
be
gone
in
five
minutes
more
the
is
turned
away
from
the
sun
and
abdel
hassan
sees
only
the
rosy
glow
of
its
light
on
the
hills
in
the
distance
which
looked
so
purple
all
day
he
sits
very
still
and
his
earnest
eyes
are
fixed
on
those
distant
hills
he
does
not
move
or
speak
when
the
is
again
pushed
aside
and
his
two
children
alee
and
gemila
come
out
with
their
little
mats
and
seat
themselves
also
on
the
sand
you
can
see
little
gemila
in
the
picture
how
glad
they
are
of
the
long
cool
shadows
and
the
tall
feathery
palms
how
pleasant
to
hear
the
camels
drink
and
to
drink
themselves
at
the
deep
well
when
they
have
carried
some
fresh
water
in
a
cup
to
their
silent
father
he
only
sends
up
blue
circles
of
smoke
from
his
long
pipe
as
he
sits
there
on
a
mat
of
rich
carpet
he
never
sat
in
a
chair
and
indeed
never
saw
one
in
his
life
his
chairs
are
mats
and
his
house
is
as
you
have
heard
a
tent
do
you
know
what
a
tent
is
i
always
liked
tents
and
thought
i
should
enjoy
living
in
one
and
when
i
was
a
little
girl
on
many
a
stormy
day
when
we
could
go
to
school
i
played
with
my
sisters
at
living
in
tents
we
would
take
a
small
and
tip
it
down
upon
its
sides
half
open
then
covering
it
with
shawls
we
crept
in
and
were
happy
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
also
play
tents
some
day
if
you
have
already
the
tent
of
gemila
father
is
however
quite
different
from
ours
two
or
three
long
poles
hold
it
up
and
over
them
hangs
a
cloth
made
of
or
sometimes
sheepskins
which
are
thick
enough
to
keep
out
either
heat
or
cold
the
ends
of
the
cloth
are
fastened
down
by
pegs
driven
into
the
sand
or
the
strong
wind
coming
might
blow
the
tent
away
the
pushes
back
like
a
curtain
for
the
door
inside
a
white
cloth
stretched
across
divides
this
strange
house
into
two
rooms
one
is
for
the
men
the
other
for
the
women
and
children
in
the
tent
there
is
no
furniture
like
ours
nothing
but
mats
and
low
cushions
called
divans
not
even
a
table
from
which
to
eat
nor
a
bed
to
sleep
upon
but
the
mats
and
the
shawls
are
very
gorgeous
and
costly
and
we
are
very
proud
when
we
can
buy
any
like
them
for
our
parlors
and
by
the
way
i
must
tell
you
that
these
people
have
been
asleep
all
through
the
heat
of
the
day
the
time
when
you
would
have
been
coming
home
from
school
eating
your
dinner
and
going
back
to
school
again
they
closed
the
to
keep
out
the
terrible
blaze
of
the
sun
stretched
themselves
on
the
mats
and
slept
until
just
now
when
the
began
to
come
now
they
can
sit
outside
the
tent
and
enjoy
the
evening
and
the
mother
brings
out
dates
and
little
hard
cakes
of
bread
with
plenty
of
butter
made
from
goats
milk
the
tall
dark
with
loose
blue
cotton
dress
and
bare
feet
milks
a
camel
and
they
all
take
their
supper
or
dinner
perhaps
i
had
better
call
it
they
have
no
plates
nor
do
they
sit
together
to
eat
the
father
eats
by
himself
when
he
has
finished
the
mother
and
children
take
the
dates
and
bread
which
he
leaves
we
could
teach
them
better
manners
we
think
but
they
could
teach
us
to
be
hospitable
and
courteous
and
more
polite
to
strangers
than
we
are
when
all
is
finished
you
see
there
are
no
dishes
to
be
washed
and
put
away
the
stars
have
come
out
and
from
the
great
arch
of
the
sky
they
look
down
on
the
broad
sands
the
lonely
rocks
the
and
the
tents
oh
they
are
so
bright
so
steady
and
so
silent
in
that
great
lonely
place
where
no
noise
is
heard
no
sounds
of
people
or
of
birds
or
animals
excepting
the
sleepy
groaning
of
a
camel
or
the
low
song
that
little
alee
is
singing
to
his
sister
as
they
lie
upon
their
backs
on
the
sand
and
watch
the
slow
grand
movement
of
the
stars
that
are
always
journeying
towards
the
west
night
is
very
beautiful
in
the
desert
for
this
is
the
desert
where
abdel
hassan
the
arab
lives
his
country
is
that
part
of
our
round
ball
where
the
yellow
sands
stretch
farther
than
eye
can
see
and
there
are
no
wide
rivers
no
thick
forests
and
no
hills
the
day
is
too
bright
and
too
hot
but
the
night
he
loves
it
is
his
friend
he
falls
asleep
at
last
out
under
the
stars
and
since
he
has
been
sleeping
so
long
in
the
daytime
can
well
afford
to
be
awake
very
early
in
the
morning
so
while
the
stars
still
shine
and
there
is
only
one
little
yellow
line
of
light
in
the
east
he
calls
his
wife
children
and
servants
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
is
bustle
and
preparation
for
they
must
take
down
the
tent
and
move
with
all
the
camels
and
goats
many
miles
away
for
the
summer
heat
has
nearly
dried
up
the
water
of
their
little
spring
under
the
and
the
grass
that
grew
there
is
also
entirely
gone
and
one
can
not
live
without
water
to
drink
particularly
in
the
desert
nor
can
the
goats
and
camels
live
without
grass
now
it
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
us
if
some
day
all
the
water
in
our
wells
and
springs
and
ponds
should
dry
up
and
all
the
grass
on
our
pleasant
pastures
and
hills
should
wither
away
what
should
we
do
should
we
have
to
pack
all
our
clothes
our
books
our
furniture
and
food
and
move
away
to
some
other
place
where
there
were
both
water
and
grass
and
then
build
new
houses
oh
how
much
trouble
it
would
give
us
no
doubt
the
children
would
think
it
great
fun
but
as
they
grew
older
they
would
have
no
pleasant
home
to
remember
with
all
that
makes
sweet
home
so
dear
and
now
you
will
see
how
much
better
it
is
for
gemila
father
than
if
he
lived
in
a
house
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
tent
is
taken
down
the
are
tied
together
the
covering
is
rolled
up
with
the
pegs
and
strings
which
fastened
it
and
it
is
all
ready
to
put
up
again
whenever
they
choose
to
stop
as
there
is
no
furniture
to
carry
the
mats
and
cushions
only
are
to
be
rolled
together
and
tied
and
now
achmet
the
old
servant
brings
a
tall
yellow
camel
did
you
ever
see
a
camel
i
hope
you
have
some
time
seen
a
living
one
in
a
menagerie
but
if
you
have
perhaps
you
have
seen
a
picture
of
the
animal
with
a
great
hump
upon
his
back
a
long
neck
and
head
thrust
forward
a
boy
told
me
the
other
day
that
when
the
camel
had
been
long
without
food
he
ate
his
hump
he
meant
that
the
flesh
and
fat
of
the
hump
helped
to
nourish
him
when
he
had
no
food
achmet
speaks
to
the
camel
and
he
immediately
kneels
upon
the
sand
while
the
man
loads
him
with
the
and
covering
after
which
he
gets
up
moves
on
a
little
way
to
make
room
for
another
to
come
up
kneel
and
be
loaded
with
mats
cushions
and
bags
of
dates
then
comes
a
third
and
while
he
kneels
another
servant
comes
from
the
spring
bringing
a
great
bag
made
of
and
filled
with
water
two
of
these
bags
are
hung
upon
the
camel
one
on
each
side
this
is
the
water
for
all
these
people
to
drink
for
four
days
while
they
travel
through
a
sandy
rocky
country
where
there
are
no
springs
or
wells
i
am
afraid
the
water
will
not
taste
very
fresh
after
it
has
been
kept
so
long
in
leather
bags
but
they
have
nothing
else
to
carry
it
in
and
besides
they
are
used
to
it
and
do
mind
the
taste
here
are
smaller
bags
made
of
and
filled
with
milk
and
when
all
these
things
are
arranged
which
is
soon
done
they
are
ready
to
start
although
it
is
still
long
before
sunrise
the
camels
have
been
drinking
at
the
spring
and
have
left
only
a
little
muddy
water
like
that
in
our
but
the
goats
must
have
this
or
none
at
all
and
now
abdel
hassan
springs
upon
his
beautiful
black
horse
that
has
such
slender
legs
and
swift
feet
and
places
himself
at
the
head
of
this
long
troop
of
men
and
women
camels
and
goats
the
women
are
riding
upon
the
camels
and
so
are
the
children
while
the
servants
and
walk
barefooted
over
the
yellow
sand
it
would
seem
very
strange
to
you
to
be
perched
up
so
high
on
a
camel
back
but
gemila
is
quite
accustomed
to
it
when
she
was
very
little
her
mother
often
hung
a
basket
beside
her
on
the
camel
and
carried
her
baby
in
it
but
now
she
is
a
great
girl
full
six
years
old
and
when
the
camel
kneels
and
her
mother
takes
her
place
the
child
can
spring
on
in
front
with
one
hand
upon
the
camel
rough
hump
and
ride
safely
and
pleasantly
hour
after
hour
good
patient
camels
god
has
fitted
them
exactly
to
be
of
the
utmost
help
to
the
people
in
that
desert
country
gemila
for
this
often
blesses
and
thanks
him
whom
she
calls
allah
all
this
morning
they
ride
first
in
the
bright
starlight
but
soon
the
stars
become
faint
and
dim
in
the
stronger
rosy
light
that
is
spreading
over
the
whole
sky
and
suddenly
the
little
girl
sees
stretching
far
before
her
the
long
shadow
of
the
camels
and
she
knows
that
the
sun
is
up
for
we
never
see
shadows
when
the
sun
is
not
up
unless
it
is
by
candlelight
or
moonlight
the
shadows
stretch
out
very
far
before
them
for
the
sun
is
behind
when
you
are
out
walking
very
early
in
the
morning
with
the
sun
behind
you
see
how
the
shadow
of
even
such
a
little
girl
as
you
will
reach
across
the
whole
street
and
you
can
imagine
that
such
great
creatures
as
camels
would
make
even
much
longer
shadows
gemila
watches
them
and
sees
too
how
the
white
patches
of
sand
flush
in
the
morning
light
and
she
looks
back
where
far
behind
are
the
tops
of
their
like
great
tufted
fans
standing
dark
against
the
yellow
sky
she
is
not
sorry
to
leave
that
old
home
she
has
had
many
homes
already
young
as
she
is
and
will
have
many
more
as
long
as
she
lives
the
whole
desert
is
her
home
it
is
very
wide
and
large
and
sometimes
she
lives
in
one
part
sometimes
in
another
as
the
sun
gets
higher
it
begins
to
grow
very
hot
the
father
arranges
the
folds
of
his
great
white
turban
a
shawl
with
many
folds
twisted
round
his
head
to
keep
off
the
oppressive
heat
the
servants
put
on
their
white
fringed
handkerchiefs
falling
over
the
head
and
down
upon
the
neck
and
held
in
place
by
a
little
cord
tied
round
the
head
it
is
not
like
a
bonnet
or
hat
but
one
of
the
very
best
things
to
protect
the
desert
travellers
from
the
sun
the
children
too
cover
their
heads
in
the
same
way
and
gemila
no
longer
looks
out
to
see
what
is
passing
the
sun
is
too
bright
it
would
hurt
her
eyes
and
make
her
head
ache
she
shuts
her
eyes
and
falls
half
asleep
sitting
there
high
upon
the
camel
back
but
if
she
could
look
out
there
would
be
nothing
to
see
but
what
she
has
seen
many
and
many
times
before
great
plains
of
sand
or
pebbles
and
sometimes
high
bare
rocks
not
a
tree
to
be
seen
and
far
off
against
the
sky
the
low
purple
hills
they
move
on
in
the
heat
and
are
all
silent
it
is
almost
noon
now
and
abdel
hassan
stops
leaps
from
his
horse
and
strikes
his
spear
into
the
ground
the
stop
the
camels
stop
and
kneel
gemila
and
alee
and
their
mother
dismount
the
servants
build
up
again
the
tent
which
they
took
down
in
the
morning
and
after
drinking
water
from
the
leathern
bags
the
family
are
soon
under
its
shelter
asleep
on
their
mats
while
the
camels
and
servants
have
crept
into
the
shadow
of
some
rocks
and
lain
down
in
the
sand
the
beautiful
black
horse
is
in
the
tent
with
his
master
he
is
treated
like
a
child
petted
and
fed
by
all
the
family
caressed
and
kissed
by
the
children
here
they
rest
until
the
heat
of
the
day
is
past
but
before
sunset
they
have
eaten
their
dates
and
bread
loaded
again
the
camels
and
are
moving
with
the
beautiful
black
horse
and
his
rider
at
the
head
they
ride
until
the
stars
are
out
and
after
but
stop
for
a
few
hours
rest
in
the
night
to
begin
the
next
day
as
they
began
this
gemila
still
rides
upon
the
camel
and
i
can
easily
understand
that
she
prays
to
allah
with
a
full
heart
under
the
shining
stars
so
clear
and
far
and
that
at
the
call
to
prayer
in
the
early
dawn
her
pretty
little
veiled
head
is
bent
in
true
love
and
worship
but
i
must
tell
you
what
she
sees
soon
after
sunrise
on
this
second
morning
across
the
sand
a
long
way
before
them
something
with
very
long
legs
is
running
almost
flying
she
knows
well
what
it
is
for
she
has
often
seen
them
before
and
she
calls
to
one
of
the
servants
see
there
is
the
ostrich
and
she
claps
her
hands
with
delight
the
ostrich
is
a
great
bird
with
very
long
legs
and
small
wings
and
as
legs
are
to
run
with
and
wings
to
fly
with
of
course
he
can
run
better
than
he
can
fly
but
he
spreads
his
short
wings
while
running
and
they
are
like
little
sails
and
help
him
along
quite
wonderfully
so
that
he
runs
much
faster
than
any
horse
can
although
he
runs
so
swiftly
he
is
sometimes
caught
in
a
very
odd
way
i
will
tell
you
how
he
is
a
large
bird
but
he
is
a
very
silly
one
and
when
he
is
tired
of
running
he
will
hide
his
head
in
the
sand
thinking
that
because
he
can
see
no
one
he
ca
be
seen
himself
then
the
arab
horses
can
overtake
him
and
the
men
can
get
his
beautiful
feathers
which
you
must
have
often
seen
for
ladies
wear
them
in
their
bonnets
all
this
about
the
ostrich
do
forget
it
my
little
girl
some
time
you
may
see
one
and
will
be
glad
that
you
know
what
kind
of
a
fellow
he
is
the
ostrich
which
gemila
sees
is
too
far
away
to
be
caught
besides
it
will
not
be
best
to
turn
aside
from
the
track
which
is
leading
them
to
a
new
spring
but
one
of
the
men
trots
forward
on
his
camel
looking
to
this
side
and
to
that
as
he
rides
and
at
last
our
little
girl
who
is
watching
sees
his
camel
kneel
and
sees
him
jump
off
and
stoop
in
the
sand
when
they
reach
the
place
they
find
a
sort
of
great
nest
hollowed
a
little
in
the
sand
and
in
it
are
great
eggs
almost
as
big
as
your
head
the
mother
ostrich
has
left
them
there
she
is
not
like
other
that
sit
upon
the
eggs
to
keep
them
warm
but
she
leaves
them
in
the
hot
sand
and
the
sun
keeps
them
warm
and
by
and
by
the
little
ostriches
will
begin
to
chip
the
shell
and
creep
out
into
the
great
world
the
ostrich
eggs
are
good
to
eat
you
eat
your
one
egg
for
breakfast
but
one
of
these
big
eggs
will
make
breakfast
for
the
whole
family
and
that
is
why
gemila
clapped
her
hands
when
she
saw
the
ostrich
she
thought
the
men
would
find
the
nest
and
have
fresh
eggs
for
a
day
or
two
this
day
passes
like
the
last
they
meet
no
one
not
a
single
man
or
woman
and
they
move
steadily
on
towards
the
sunset
in
the
morning
again
they
are
up
and
away
under
the
starlight
and
this
day
is
a
happy
one
for
the
children
and
indeed
for
all
the
morning
star
is
yet
shining
low
large
and
bright
when
our
watchful
little
girl
dark
eyes
can
see
a
row
of
black
dots
on
the
sand
so
small
you
might
think
them
nothing
but
flies
but
gemila
knows
better
they
only
look
small
because
they
are
far
away
they
are
really
men
and
camels
and
horses
too
as
she
will
soon
see
when
they
come
nearer
a
whole
troop
of
them
as
many
as
a
hundred
camels
loaded
with
great
packages
of
cloths
and
shawls
for
turbans
carpets
and
rich
spices
and
the
beautiful
red
and
green
morocco
of
which
when
i
was
a
little
girl
we
sometimes
had
shoes
made
but
we
see
it
oftener
now
on
the
covers
of
books
all
these
things
belong
to
the
sheik
hassein
he
has
been
to
the
great
cities
to
buy
them
and
now
he
is
carrying
them
across
the
desert
to
sell
again
he
himself
rides
at
the
head
of
his
company
on
a
magnificent
brown
horse
and
his
dress
is
so
grand
and
gay
that
it
shines
in
the
morning
light
quite
splendidly
a
great
shawl
with
golden
fringes
is
twisted
about
his
head
for
a
turban
and
he
wears
instead
of
a
coat
a
tunic
broadly
striped
with
crimson
and
yellow
while
a
scarlet
robe
falls
from
his
shoulders
his
face
is
dark
and
his
eyes
keen
and
bright
only
a
little
of
his
straight
black
hair
hangs
below
the
fringes
of
his
turban
but
his
beard
is
long
and
dark
and
he
really
looks
very
magnificent
sitting
upon
his
fine
horse
in
the
full
morning
sunlight
abdel
hassan
rides
forward
to
meet
him
and
the
children
from
behind
watch
with
great
delight
abdel
hassan
takes
the
hand
of
the
sheik
presses
it
to
his
lips
and
forehead
and
says
peace
be
with
you
do
you
see
how
different
this
is
from
the
and
of
the
gentlemen
whom
we
know
many
grand
compliments
are
offered
from
one
to
another
and
they
are
very
polite
and
respectful
our
manners
would
seem
very
poor
beside
theirs
then
follows
a
long
talk
and
the
smoking
of
pipes
while
the
servants
make
coffee
and
serve
it
in
little
cups
hassein
tells
abdel
hassan
of
the
wells
of
fresh
water
which
he
left
but
one
day
journey
behind
him
and
he
tells
of
the
rich
cities
he
has
visited
abdel
hassan
gives
him
dates
and
salt
in
exchange
for
cloth
for
a
turban
and
a
brown
cotton
dress
for
his
little
daughter
it
is
not
often
that
one
meets
men
in
the
desert
and
this
day
will
long
be
remembered
by
the
children
the
next
night
before
sunset
they
can
see
the
green
feathery
tops
of
the
before
them
the
palms
have
no
branches
but
only
great
clusters
of
leaves
at
the
top
of
the
tree
under
which
grow
the
sweet
dates
near
those
will
be
gemila
home
for
a
little
while
for
here
they
will
find
grass
and
a
spring
the
camels
smell
the
water
and
begin
to
trot
fast
the
goats
leap
along
over
the
sand
and
the
barefooted
men
hasten
to
keep
up
with
them
in
an
hour
more
the
tent
is
pitched
under
the
and
all
have
refreshed
themselves
with
the
cool
clear
water
and
now
i
must
tell
you
that
the
camels
have
had
nothing
to
drink
since
they
left
the
old
home
the
camel
has
a
deep
bag
below
his
throat
which
he
fills
with
water
enough
to
last
four
or
five
days
so
he
can
travel
in
the
desert
as
long
as
that
and
sometimes
longer
without
drinking
again
yet
i
believe
the
camels
are
as
glad
as
the
children
to
come
to
the
fresh
spring
gemila
thinks
so
at
night
as
she
stands
under
the
starlight
patting
her
good
camel
simel
and
kissing
his
great
lips
the
black
goats
with
long
silky
ears
are
already
cropping
the
grass
the
father
sits
again
at
the
and
smokes
his
long
pipe
the
children
bury
their
bare
feet
in
the
sand
and
heap
it
into
little
mounds
about
them
while
the
mother
is
bringing
out
the
dates
and
the
bread
and
butter
it
is
an
easy
thing
for
them
to
move
they
are
already
at
home
again
but
although
they
have
so
few
cares
we
do
not
wish
ourselves
in
their
place
for
we
love
the
home
of
our
childhood
be
it
ever
so
humble
better
than
roaming
like
an
exile
but
all
the
time
i
have
told
you
how
gemila
looks
nor
what
clothes
she
wears
her
face
is
dark
she
has
a
little
straight
nose
full
lips
and
dark
earnest
eyes
her
dark
hair
will
be
braided
when
it
is
long
enough
on
her
arms
and
her
ankles
are
gilded
bracelets
and
anklets
and
she
wears
a
brown
cotton
dress
loosely
hanging
halfway
to
the
bare
slender
ankles
on
her
head
the
white
fringed
handkerchief
of
which
i
told
you
hangs
like
a
little
veil
her
face
is
pleasant
and
when
she
smiles
her
white
teeth
shine
between
her
parted
lips
she
is
the
child
of
the
desert
and
she
loves
her
desert
home
i
think
she
would
hardly
be
happy
to
live
in
a
house
eat
from
a
table
and
sleep
in
a
little
bed
like
yours
she
would
grow
restless
and
weary
if
she
should
live
so
long
and
so
quietly
in
one
place
the
little
mountain
maiden
illustration
i
want
you
to
look
at
the
picture
on
this
page
it
is
a
little
deer
its
name
is
the
chamois
do
you
see
what
delicate
horns
it
has
and
what
slender
legs
and
how
it
seems
to
stand
on
that
bit
of
rock
and
lift
its
head
to
watch
for
the
hunters
last
summer
i
saw
a
little
chamois
like
that
and
just
as
small
it
was
not
alive
but
cut
or
carved
of
wood
such
a
graceful
pretty
little
plaything
as
one
does
not
meet
every
day
would
you
like
to
know
who
made
it
and
where
it
came
from
it
was
made
in
the
mountain
country
by
the
brother
of
my
good
jeannette
the
little
swiss
maiden
here
among
the
high
mountains
she
lives
with
her
father
mother
and
brothers
and
far
up
among
those
high
snowy
peaks
which
are
seen
behind
the
house
the
chamois
live
many
of
them
together
eating
the
tender
grass
and
little
flowers
and
leaping
and
springing
away
over
the
ice
and
snow
when
they
see
the
men
coming
up
to
hunt
them
i
will
tell
you
by
and
by
how
it
happened
that
jeannette
tall
brother
joseph
carved
this
tiny
chamois
from
wood
but
first
you
must
know
about
this
small
house
upon
the
great
hills
and
how
they
live
up
there
so
near
the
blue
sky
one
would
think
it
might
be
easier
for
a
child
to
be
good
and
pure
so
far
up
among
the
quiet
hills
and
that
there
god
would
seem
to
come
close
to
the
spirit
even
of
a
little
girl
or
boy
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
tall
trees
are
growing
pine
and
fir
trees
which
are
green
in
winter
as
well
as
in
summer
if
you
go
into
the
woods
in
winter
you
will
find
that
almost
all
the
trees
have
dropped
their
pretty
green
leaves
upon
the
ground
and
are
standing
cold
and
naked
in
the
winter
wind
but
the
pines
and
the
firs
keep
on
their
warm
green
clothes
all
the
year
round
it
was
many
years
ago
before
jeannette
was
born
that
her
father
came
to
the
mountains
with
his
sharp
axe
and
cut
down
some
of
the
other
men
helped
him
and
they
cut
the
great
trees
into
strong
logs
and
boards
and
built
of
them
the
house
of
which
i
have
told
you
now
he
will
have
a
good
home
of
his
own
for
as
long
as
he
likes
to
live
there
and
to
it
will
come
his
wife
and
children
as
god
shall
send
them
to
nestle
among
the
hills
then
he
went
down
to
the
little
town
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
when
he
came
back
he
was
leading
a
brown
donkey
and
upon
that
donkey
sat
a
young
woman
with
smiling
brown
eyes
and
long
braids
of
brown
hair
hanging
below
a
little
green
hat
set
on
one
side
of
her
head
while
beautiful
carnations
peeped
from
beneath
it
on
the
other
side
who
was
this
it
was
jeannette
you
know
i
told
you
this
was
before
she
was
born
can
you
guess
or
must
i
tell
you
that
it
was
the
little
girl
mother
she
had
come
up
the
mountain
for
the
first
time
to
her
new
home
the
house
built
of
the
fir
and
the
pine
where
after
awhile
were
born
jeannette
two
tall
brothers
and
at
last
jeannette
herself
it
was
a
good
place
to
be
born
in
when
she
was
a
baby
she
used
to
lie
on
the
short
sweet
grass
before
the
doorstep
and
watch
the
cows
and
the
goats
feeding
and
clap
her
little
hands
to
see
how
rosy
the
sunset
made
the
snow
that
shone
on
the
tops
of
those
high
peaks
and
the
next
summer
when
she
could
run
alone
she
picked
the
gentians
thrusting
her
small
fingers
between
their
fringed
eyelids
and
begging
them
to
open
and
look
at
little
jean
and
she
stained
her
wee
hands
among
the
strawberries
and
pricked
them
with
the
thorns
of
the
long
when
she
went
with
her
mother
in
the
afternoon
to
pick
the
sweet
fruit
for
supper
ah
she
was
a
happy
little
thing
many
a
fall
she
got
over
the
stones
or
among
the
brown
moss
and
many
a
time
the
clean
frock
that
she
wore
was
dyed
red
with
the
crushed
berries
but
oh
how
pleasant
it
was
to
find
them
in
great
patches
on
the
where
the
kind
sun
had
warmed
them
into
such
delicious
life
i
have
seen
the
children
run
out
of
school
to
pick
such
sweet
wild
strawberries
all
the
up
in
the
fields
of
maine
and
how
happy
they
were
with
their
little
stained
fingers
as
they
came
back
at
the
call
of
the
bell
in
the
black
grew
the
alpen
roses
and
her
mother
said
do
not
go
there
my
little
daughter
it
is
too
muddy
for
you
but
at
night
when
her
brother
came
home
from
the
chamois
hunt
he
took
off
his
tall
pointed
hat
and
showed
his
little
sister
the
long
spray
of
roses
twisted
round
it
which
he
had
brought
for
her
he
could
go
in
the
mud
with
his
thick
boots
you
know
and
never
mind
it
here
they
live
alone
upon
the
mountain
there
are
no
near
neighbors
at
evening
they
can
see
the
blue
smoke
curling
from
the
chimney
of
one
house
that
stands
behind
that
sunny
green
slope
a
hundred
yards
from
their
door
and
they
can
always
look
down
upon
the
many
houses
of
the
town
below
where
the
mother
lived
when
she
was
young
many
times
has
jeannette
wondered
how
the
people
lived
down
there
so
many
together
and
where
their
cows
could
feed
and
whether
there
were
any
little
girls
like
herself
and
if
they
picked
berries
and
had
such
a
dear
old
black
as
hers
that
gave
milk
for
her
supper
and
now
had
two
little
black
kids
its
babies
she
did
know
about
those
little
children
in
maine
and
that
they
have
little
kids
and
goats
as
well
as
sweet
red
berries
to
make
the
days
pass
happily
she
wanted
to
go
down
and
see
some
day
and
her
father
promised
that
when
she
was
a
great
girl
she
should
go
down
with
him
on
to
sell
the
cheeses
and
the
sweet
butter
that
her
mother
made
when
the
cows
and
goats
have
eaten
all
the
grass
near
the
house
her
father
drives
them
before
him
up
farther
among
the
mountains
where
more
grass
is
growing
and
there
he
stays
with
them
many
weeks
he
does
not
even
come
home
at
night
but
sleeps
in
a
small
hut
among
the
rocks
where
too
he
keeps
the
large
clean
and
the
little
stool
upon
which
he
sits
at
morning
and
night
to
milk
the
cows
and
goats
when
the
pails
are
full
the
butter
is
to
be
made
and
the
cheese
and
he
works
while
the
animals
feed
the
cows
have
little
bells
tied
to
their
necks
that
he
may
hear
and
find
them
should
they
stray
too
far
many
times
when
he
is
away
does
his
little
daughter
at
home
listen
listen
while
she
sits
before
the
door
to
hear
the
distant
tinkling
of
the
she
is
a
loving
little
daughter
and
she
thinks
of
her
father
so
far
away
alone
and
wishes
he
was
coming
home
to
eat
some
of
the
sweet
strawberries
and
cream
for
supper
last
summer
some
travellers
came
to
the
house
they
stopped
at
the
door
and
asked
for
milk
the
mother
brought
them
brimming
bowlsful
and
the
shy
little
girl
crept
up
behind
her
mother
with
her
baskets
of
berries
the
gentlemen
took
them
and
thanked
her
and
one
told
of
his
own
little
mary
at
home
far
away
over
the
great
sea
jeannette
often
thinks
of
her
and
wonders
whether
her
papa
has
gone
home
to
her
while
the
gentlemen
talked
jeannette
brother
joseph
sat
upon
the
broad
stone
doorstep
and
listened
presently
one
gentleman
turning
to
him
asked
if
he
would
come
with
them
over
the
mountain
to
lead
the
way
for
there
are
many
wild
places
and
high
steep
rocks
and
they
feared
to
get
lost
joseph
sprang
up
from
his
low
seat
and
said
he
would
go
brought
his
tall
hat
and
his
like
a
long
strong
cane
with
a
sharp
iron
at
the
end
which
he
can
stick
into
the
snow
or
ice
if
there
is
danger
of
slipping
and
they
went
merrily
on
their
way
over
the
green
grass
over
the
rocks
far
up
among
the
snow
and
ice
and
the
frozen
streams
and
rivers
that
pour
down
the
joseph
was
brave
and
gay
he
led
the
way
singing
aloud
until
the
echoes
answered
from
every
hillside
it
makes
one
happy
to
sing
and
when
we
are
busy
and
happy
we
sing
without
thinking
of
it
as
the
birds
do
when
everything
is
bright
and
beautiful
in
nature
around
us
we
feel
like
singing
aloud
and
praising
god
who
made
the
earth
so
beautiful
then
the
earth
also
seems
to
sing
of
god
who
made
it
and
the
echo
seems
like
its
answer
of
praise
did
you
ever
hear
the
echo
the
voice
that
seems
to
come
from
a
hill
or
a
house
far
away
repeating
whatever
you
may
say
among
the
mountains
the
echoes
answer
each
other
again
and
again
jeannette
has
often
heard
them
that
night
while
the
mother
and
her
little
girl
were
eating
their
supper
the
gentlemen
came
back
again
bringing
joseph
with
them
he
could
not
walk
now
nor
spring
from
rock
to
rock
with
his
alpen
staff
he
had
fallen
and
broken
his
leg
and
he
must
lie
still
for
many
days
but
he
could
keep
a
cheerful
face
and
still
sing
his
merry
songs
and
as
he
grew
better
and
could
sit
out
again
on
the
broad
bench
beside
the
door
he
took
his
knife
and
pieces
of
fine
wood
and
carved
beautiful
things
first
a
spoon
for
his
little
sister
with
gentians
on
the
handle
then
a
nice
bowl
with
a
pretty
carved
all
about
the
edge
and
from
this
bowl
and
with
this
spoon
she
ate
her
supper
every
night
sweet
milk
with
the
dry
cakes
of
rye
bread
broken
into
it
and
sometimes
the
red
strawberries
i
know
his
little
sister
loved
him
dearly
and
thanked
him
in
her
heart
every
time
she
used
the
pretty
things
how
dearly
a
sister
and
brother
can
love
each
other
then
he
made
other
things
knives
forks
and
plates
and
at
last
one
day
he
sharpened
his
knife
very
sharp
chose
a
very
nice
delicate
piece
of
wood
and
carved
this
beautiful
chamois
just
like
a
living
one
only
so
small
my
cousin
who
was
travelling
there
bought
it
and
brought
it
home
when
the
summer
had
passed
the
father
came
down
from
the
high
pastures
the
butter
and
cheese
making
was
over
and
the
autumn
work
was
now
to
be
done
do
you
want
to
know
what
the
autumn
work
was
and
how
jeannette
could
help
about
it
i
will
tell
you
you
must
know
that
a
little
way
down
the
is
a
grove
of
did
you
ever
see
the
they
grow
in
our
woods
and
on
the
shores
of
some
ponds
in
the
spring
they
are
covered
with
long
yellowish
blossoms
and
all
through
the
hot
summer
those
blossoms
are
at
work
turning
into
sweet
chestnuts
wrapped
safely
in
round
thorny
balls
which
will
prick
your
fingers
sadly
if
you
do
take
care
but
when
the
frost
of
the
autumn
nights
comes
it
cracks
open
the
prickly
ball
and
shows
a
shining
brown
nut
inside
then
if
we
are
careful
we
may
pull
off
the
covering
and
take
out
the
nut
sometimes
indeed
there
are
two
three
or
four
nuts
in
one
shell
i
have
found
them
so
myself
now
the
autumn
work
which
i
said
i
would
tell
you
about
is
to
gather
these
chestnuts
and
store
them
away
some
to
be
eaten
boiled
or
roasted
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
cold
winter
days
that
are
coming
and
some
to
be
nicely
packed
in
great
bags
and
carried
on
the
donkey
down
to
the
town
to
be
sold
the
boys
of
new
england
too
know
what
good
fun
it
is
to
gather
nuts
in
the
fall
and
spread
them
over
the
garret
floor
to
dry
and
at
last
to
crack
and
eat
them
by
the
winter
hearth
so
when
the
father
says
one
night
at
it
is
growing
cold
i
think
there
will
be
a
frost
jeannette
knows
very
well
what
to
do
and
she
dances
away
right
early
in
the
evening
to
her
little
bed
which
is
made
in
a
wooden
box
built
up
against
the
side
of
the
wall
and
falls
asleep
to
dream
about
the
chestnut
woods
and
the
squirrels
and
the
little
brook
that
leaps
and
springs
from
rock
to
rock
down
under
the
tall
dark
trees
she
has
gone
to
bed
early
that
she
may
wake
with
the
first
daylight
and
she
is
out
of
bed
in
a
minute
when
she
hears
her
father
cheerful
call
in
the
morning
come
children
it
is
time
to
be
off
their
dinner
is
packed
in
a
large
basket
the
donkey
stands
ready
before
the
door
with
great
empty
bags
hanging
at
each
side
and
they
go
merrily
over
the
crisp
white
frost
to
the
how
the
frost
has
opened
the
burrs
he
has
done
more
than
half
their
work
for
them
already
how
they
laugh
and
sing
and
shout
to
each
other
as
they
gather
the
smooth
brown
nuts
filling
their
baskets
and
running
to
pour
them
into
the
great
bags
it
is
merry
autumn
work
the
sun
looks
down
upon
them
through
the
yellow
leaves
and
the
rocks
give
them
mossy
seats
while
here
and
there
comes
a
bird
or
a
squirrel
to
see
what
these
strange
people
are
doing
in
their
woods
jeannette
declares
that
the
chestnut
days
are
the
best
in
the
year
perhaps
she
is
right
i
am
sure
i
should
enjoy
them
should
you
she
really
helps
although
she
is
but
a
little
girl
and
her
father
says
at
night
that
his
little
jean
is
a
dear
good
child
it
makes
her
very
happy
she
thinks
of
what
he
has
said
while
she
undresses
at
night
unbraiding
her
hair
and
unlacing
her
little
blue
bodice
with
its
great
white
sleeves
and
she
goes
peacefully
to
sleep
to
dream
again
of
the
merry
autumn
days
and
while
she
dreams
good
angels
must
be
near
her
for
she
said
her
sweet
and
reverent
prayer
on
her
knees
with
a
full
and
thankful
heart
to
the
who
gave
her
so
many
blessings
she
is
our
little
mountain
sister
the
mountain
life
is
a
fresh
and
happy
one
i
should
like
to
stay
with
this
little
sister
a
long
long
time
the
story
of
dear
children
have
you
ever
watched
the
sun
set
if
you
live
in
the
country
i
am
almost
sure
you
have
many
times
delighted
yourselves
with
the
gold
and
rosy
clouds
but
those
of
you
who
live
in
the
city
do
not
often
have
the
opportunity
the
high
houses
and
narrow
streets
shut
out
so
much
of
the
sky
i
am
so
happy
as
to
live
in
the
country
and
let
me
tell
you
where
i
go
to
see
the
sun
set
the
house
in
which
i
live
has
some
dark
narrow
garret
stairs
leading
from
the
third
story
into
a
small
garret
under
the
roof
and
many
and
many
a
time
do
i
go
up
these
narrow
stairs
and
again
up
to
the
in
the
roof
open
it
and
seat
myself
on
the
top
step
or
on
the
roof
itself
here
i
can
look
over
the
and
even
over
the
seeing
many
things
of
which
i
may
perhaps
tell
you
at
some
time
but
we
are
to
look
at
the
sunset
can
you
play
that
you
are
up
here
with
me
looking
past
the
houses
past
the
and
the
low
hills
that
seem
so
far
away
to
where
the
sun
hangs
low
like
a
great
red
ball
so
bright
that
we
can
hardly
look
at
it
watch
it
with
me
now
a
little
part
has
disappeared
now
it
is
half
gone
and
in
a
minute
more
we
see
nothing
but
the
train
of
bright
clouds
it
has
left
behind
where
did
it
go
it
seemed
to
slip
down
over
the
edge
of
the
world
morning
if
you
are
up
early
you
will
see
it
come
back
again
on
the
other
side
as
it
goes
away
from
us
it
is
coming
to
somebody
who
lives
far
away
round
the
other
side
of
the
world
while
we
had
the
sunshine
she
had
night
and
now
when
night
is
coming
to
us
it
is
morning
for
her
i
think
men
have
always
felt
like
following
the
sun
to
the
unknown
west
beyond
its
golden
gate
of
setting
day
and
perhaps
that
has
led
many
a
wanderer
on
his
path
of
discovery
let
us
follow
the
sun
over
the
rolling
earth
the
sun
has
gone
shall
we
go
too
and
take
a
peep
round
there
to
see
who
is
having
morning
now
the
long
bright
sunbeams
are
sliding
over
the
tossing
ocean
and
sparkling
on
the
blue
water
of
a
river
upon
which
are
hundreds
of
boats
the
boats
are
not
like
those
which
we
see
here
with
white
sails
or
long
oars
they
are
clumsy
things
without
sails
and
they
have
little
sheds
or
houses
built
upon
them
we
will
look
into
one
and
see
what
is
to
be
seen
there
is
something
like
a
little
yard
built
all
around
this
boat
in
it
are
ducks
more
ducks
than
you
can
well
count
this
is
their
bedroom
where
they
sleep
at
night
but
now
it
is
morning
and
they
are
all
stirring
waddling
about
as
well
as
they
can
in
the
crowd
and
quacking
with
most
noisy
voices
they
are
waking
up
their
master
who
lives
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
and
out
he
comes
from
the
door
of
his
odd
house
and
out
comes
little
his
daughter
who
likes
to
see
the
ducks
go
for
their
breakfast
the
father
opens
a
gate
or
door
in
the
fence
of
the
house
and
they
all
crowd
and
hurry
to
reach
the
water
again
after
staying
all
night
shut
up
in
this
cage
there
they
go
tumbling
and
diving
each
must
have
a
thorough
bath
first
of
all
then
the
old
drake
leads
the
way
and
they
swim
off
in
the
bright
water
along
the
shore
for
a
hundred
yards
and
then
among
the
marshes
where
they
will
feed
all
day
and
come
back
at
night
when
they
hear
the
shrill
whistle
of
calling
them
to
come
home
and
go
to
bed
and
her
father
will
go
in
to
breakfast
now
under
the
bamboo
roof
which
slides
over
the
middle
part
of
the
boat
or
can
be
pushed
back
if
they
desire
as
turns
to
go
in
and
takes
off
his
bamboo
hat
the
sun
shines
on
his
bare
shaved
head
where
only
one
lock
of
hair
is
left
that
is
braided
into
a
long
thick
tail
and
hangs
far
down
his
back
he
is
very
proud
of
it
and
nothing
would
induce
him
to
have
it
cut
off
now
it
hangs
down
over
his
loose
blue
nankeen
jacket
but
when
he
goes
to
work
he
will
twist
it
round
upon
the
crown
of
his
head
and
tuck
the
end
under
the
coil
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
is
this
a
funny
way
for
a
man
to
wear
his
hair
has
hers
still
in
little
soft
curls
but
by
and
by
it
will
be
braided
and
at
last
fastened
up
into
a
high
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
as
her
mother
is
her
little
brother
lin
already
has
his
head
shaved
almost
bare
and
waits
impatiently
for
the
time
when
his
single
lock
of
hair
will
be
long
enough
to
braid
when
i
was
a
child
it
was
a
very
rare
thing
to
see
people
such
as
these
in
our
own
land
but
now
we
are
quite
familiar
with
these
odd
ways
of
dressing
and
our
streets
have
many
of
these
funny
names
on
their
signs
shall
we
look
in
to
see
them
at
breakfast
tea
for
the
children
as
well
as
for
the
father
and
mother
they
have
no
milk
and
do
not
like
to
drink
water
so
they
take
many
cups
of
tea
every
day
and
here
too
are
their
bowls
of
rice
upon
the
table
but
no
spoons
or
forks
with
which
to
eat
it
however
does
not
need
spoon
or
fork
she
takes
two
small
smooth
sticks
and
lifting
the
bowl
to
her
mouth
uses
the
sticks
like
a
little
shovel
you
would
spill
the
rice
and
soil
your
dress
if
you
should
try
to
do
so
but
these
children
know
no
other
way
and
they
have
learned
to
do
it
quite
carefully
the
sticks
are
called
chopsticks
and
up
in
the
great
house
on
the
hill
where
went
to
carry
fish
lives
a
little
lady
who
has
beautiful
pearl
chopsticks
and
wears
roses
in
her
hair
often
thinks
of
her
and
wishes
she
might
go
again
to
carry
the
fish
and
see
some
of
the
beautiful
things
in
that
garden
with
the
high
walls
perhaps
you
have
in
your
own
house
or
in
your
schoolroom
pictures
of
some
of
the
pretty
things
that
may
have
been
there
little
children
and
ladies
dressed
in
flowery
gowns
with
fans
in
their
hands
and
pretty
dishes
and
a
great
many
lovely
flowers
and
beautiful
birds
but
now
she
must
not
stop
to
think
breakfast
is
over
and
the
father
must
go
on
shore
to
his
work
carrying
to
the
store
of
a
great
merchant
lin
too
goes
to
his
work
of
which
i
will
by
and
by
tell
you
and
even
and
her
little
sister
young
as
they
are
must
go
with
their
mother
who
has
a
in
which
she
carries
fresh
fruit
and
vegetables
to
the
big
ships
which
are
lying
off
shore
the
two
little
girls
can
help
at
the
oars
while
the
mother
steers
to
guide
the
boat
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
pleasant
it
is
out
on
the
river
this
bright
morning
a
hundred
boats
are
moving
the
ducks
and
geese
have
all
gone
up
the
stream
the
people
who
live
in
the
boats
have
breakfasted
and
the
fishermen
have
come
out
to
their
work
this
is
lin
work
he
works
with
his
uncle
chow
and
already
his
blue
trousers
are
stripped
above
his
knees
and
he
stands
on
the
wet
watching
some
brown
birds
suddenly
one
of
them
plunges
into
the
water
and
brings
up
a
fish
in
its
yellow
bill
lin
takes
it
out
and
sends
the
bird
for
another
and
such
industrious
fishermen
are
the
brown
cormorants
that
they
keep
lin
and
his
uncle
busy
all
the
morning
until
the
two
large
baskets
are
filled
with
fish
and
then
the
cormorants
may
catch
for
themselves
lin
brings
his
bamboo
pole
rests
it
across
his
shoulders
hangs
one
basket
on
each
end
and
goes
up
into
the
town
to
sell
his
fish
here
it
was
that
went
on
that
happy
day
when
she
saw
the
little
lady
in
the
house
on
the
hill
and
she
has
not
forgotten
the
wonders
of
that
day
in
the
streets
the
gay
in
front
of
the
shops
with
colors
flying
the
busy
workmen
tinkers
mending
or
making
their
wares
blacksmiths
with
all
their
tools
set
up
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
barbers
with
grave
faces
intently
braiding
the
long
hair
of
their
customers
with
deep
hung
from
a
bamboo
pole
like
lin
the
soldiers
in
their
paper
helmets
wadded
gowns
and
quilted
petticoats
with
long
clumsy
guns
over
their
shoulders
and
learned
scholars
in
brown
gowns
blue
bordered
and
golden
birds
on
their
caps
the
high
officers
cousins
to
the
emperor
have
the
sacred
yellow
girdle
round
their
waists
and
very
long
braided
tails
hanging
below
their
small
caps
here
and
there
you
may
see
a
high
narrow
box
resting
on
poles
carried
by
two
men
it
is
the
only
kind
of
carriage
which
you
will
see
in
these
streets
and
in
it
is
a
lady
going
out
to
take
the
air
although
i
am
sadly
afraid
she
gets
but
little
shut
up
there
in
her
box
i
would
rather
be
like
a
poor
hardworking
little
girl
with
a
fresh
life
on
the
river
and
a
hard
mat
spread
for
her
bed
in
the
boat
at
night
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
a
boat
on
a
pleasant
river
with
the
ducks
and
geese
i
think
you
would
have
a
very
jolly
time
rocked
to
sleep
by
the
tide
and
watched
over
by
the
dancing
but
this
poor
lady
could
walk
or
enjoy
much
if
she
were
allowed
shall
i
tell
you
why
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
smaller
than
you
are
smaller
than
is
now
her
soft
baby
feet
were
bound
up
tightly
the
toes
turned
and
pressed
under
and
the
poor
little
foot
cramped
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
this
was
done
that
her
feet
might
never
grow
large
for
in
this
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
one
is
considered
very
beautiful
who
has
small
feet
and
now
that
she
is
a
grown
lady
as
old
perhaps
as
your
mamma
she
wears
such
little
shoes
you
would
think
them
too
small
for
yourself
it
is
true
they
are
very
pretty
shoes
made
of
satin
and
worked
all
over
with
gold
and
silver
thread
and
they
have
beautiful
white
soles
of
and
the
poor
lady
looks
down
at
them
and
says
to
herself
proudly
only
three
inches
long
and
forgetting
how
much
the
bandages
pained
her
and
not
thinking
how
sad
it
is
only
to
be
able
to
hobble
about
a
little
instead
of
running
and
leaping
as
children
should
she
binds
up
the
feet
of
lou
her
dear
little
daughter
in
the
great
house
on
the
hill
and
makes
her
a
poor
helpless
child
not
so
happy
with
all
her
gold
and
silver
fish
and
beautiful
birds
as
with
her
broad
bare
feet
and
comfortable
fat
little
toes
as
she
stands
in
the
wet
helping
her
mother
wash
it
with
while
the
leather
shoes
of
both
of
them
lie
high
and
dry
on
the
edge
of
the
wharf
until
the
wet
work
is
done
but
we
are
forgetting
lin
who
has
carried
his
fish
up
into
the
town
to
sell
here
is
a
whole
street
where
nothing
is
sold
but
food
i
should
call
it
market
street
and
i
dare
say
they
do
the
same
in
a
way
of
their
own
what
will
all
these
busy
people
have
for
dinner
fat
brought
from
the
dark
forest
fifty
miles
away
these
will
do
for
that
mandarin
with
the
red
ball
on
the
top
of
his
cap
i
think
he
has
eaten
something
of
the
same
kind
before
a
soup
for
my
lady
in
the
great
house
on
the
hill
birds
nests
brought
from
the
rocks
where
the
waves
dash
and
the
birds
feel
themselves
very
safe
but
such
a
delicious
soup
said
madam
and
her
son
sent
the
fisherman
again
to
the
black
rocks
for
more
what
will
the
soldiers
have
the
officer
who
wears
thick
satin
boots
and
does
look
much
like
fighting
in
his
gay
silk
dress
a
stew
of
fat
puppies
for
him
and
only
boiled
rats
for
the
porter
who
carries
the
heavy
but
there
is
tea
for
all
and
rice
too
as
much
as
they
desire
and
although
i
should
care
to
be
invited
to
dine
with
any
of
them
i
do
doubt
they
enjoy
the
food
very
much
in
the
midst
of
all
this
buying
and
selling
lin
sells
his
fish
some
to
the
english
gentleman
and
some
to
the
man
in
the
blue
gown
and
he
goes
happily
home
to
his
own
dinner
in
the
boat
rice
again
and
fried
mice
and
the
merry
face
and
small
slanting
black
eyes
of
his
little
sister
to
greet
him
after
dinner
his
father
has
a
pipe
to
smoke
before
he
goes
again
to
his
work
after
all
why
not
eat
puppies
and
mice
as
well
as
calves
and
turtles
and
oysters
and
as
for
soup
i
should
think
it
quite
as
good
as
chicken
pie
it
is
only
custom
that
makes
any
difference
so
pass
the
days
of
our
child
who
lives
on
the
great
river
which
men
call
the
child
of
the
ocean
but
it
was
not
always
so
she
was
born
among
the
hills
where
the
tea
grows
with
its
glossy
leaves
and
white
fragrant
blossoms
when
the
were
in
bloom
first
saw
the
light
and
when
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
baby
she
trotted
behind
her
father
while
he
gathered
the
leaves
dried
and
rolled
them
and
then
packed
them
in
square
boxes
to
come
in
ships
across
the
ocean
for
your
papa
and
mine
to
drink
here
too
grew
the
with
their
purple
fruit
and
white
and
learned
to
know
and
to
love
the
little
worms
that
eat
the
and
then
spin
for
themselves
a
silken
shell
and
fall
into
a
long
sleep
inside
of
it
she
watched
her
mother
spin
off
the
fine
silk
and
make
it
into
neat
skeins
and
once
she
rode
on
her
mother
back
to
market
to
sell
it
you
could
gather
and
set
up
these
little
silkworm
boxes
on
the
windowsill
of
your
schoolroom
i
have
seen
silk
and
flax
and
cotton
all
growing
in
a
pleasant
schoolroom
to
show
the
scholars
of
what
linen
and
silk
and
cotton
are
made
now
those
days
are
all
past
she
can
hardly
remember
them
she
was
so
little
then
and
she
has
learned
to
be
happy
in
her
new
home
on
the
river
where
they
came
when
the
fire
burned
their
house
and
the
and
the
were
taken
by
other
men
sometimes
at
night
after
the
day
work
is
over
the
ducks
have
come
home
and
the
stars
have
come
out
she
sits
at
the
door
of
the
and
watches
the
great
bright
fireflies
over
the
marshes
and
thinks
of
the
blue
lake
syhoo
covered
with
lilies
where
gilded
boats
are
sailing
and
the
people
seem
so
happy
up
in
the
garden
of
the
great
house
on
the
hill
the
have
spread
their
broad
soft
wings
and
are
flitting
among
the
flowers
and
the
little
girl
with
the
small
feet
lies
on
her
silken
bed
half
asleep
she
too
thinks
of
the
lake
and
the
lilies
but
she
knows
nothing
about
who
lives
down
upon
the
river
see
the
sun
has
gone
from
them
it
must
be
morning
for
us
now
the
little
dark
girl
in
this
part
of
the
world
manenko
would
certainly
be
considered
a
very
wild
little
girl
i
wonder
how
you
would
enjoy
her
for
a
playmate
she
has
never
been
to
school
although
she
is
more
than
seven
years
old
and
does
know
how
to
read
or
even
to
tell
her
letters
she
has
never
seen
a
book
but
once
and
she
has
never
learned
to
sew
or
to
knit
if
you
should
try
to
play
at
paper
dolls
with
her
she
would
make
very
funny
work
with
the
dresses
i
assure
you
since
she
never
wore
a
gown
or
bonnet
or
shoes
herself
how
should
she
know
how
to
put
them
on
to
the
doll
but
if
she
had
a
doll
like
herself
i
am
sure
she
would
be
as
fond
of
it
as
you
are
of
yours
and
it
would
be
a
very
cunning
little
dolly
i
should
think
perhaps
you
have
one
that
looks
somewhat
like
this
little
girl
in
the
picture
now
i
will
tell
you
of
some
things
which
she
can
do
she
can
paddle
the
small
canoe
on
the
river
she
can
help
to
hoe
the
young
corn
and
can
find
the
wild
bees
honey
in
the
woods
gather
the
scarlet
fruit
when
it
is
fully
ripe
and
falls
from
the
trees
and
help
her
mother
to
pound
the
corn
in
the
great
wooden
mortar
all
this
and
much
more
as
you
will
see
manenko
can
do
for
every
little
girl
on
the
round
world
can
help
her
mother
and
do
many
useful
things
would
you
like
to
know
more
of
her
how
she
looks
and
where
she
lives
and
what
she
does
all
day
and
all
night
here
is
a
little
round
house
with
low
doorways
most
like
those
of
a
dog
house
you
see
we
should
have
to
stoop
in
going
in
look
at
the
round
pointed
roof
made
of
the
long
rushes
that
grow
by
the
river
and
braided
together
firmly
with
strips
of
fine
soft
grass
is
spread
all
over
this
roof
to
keep
out
the
rain
if
you
look
on
the
roof
of
the
house
across
the
street
you
will
see
that
it
is
covered
with
strips
of
wood
called
shingles
which
are
laid
one
over
the
edge
of
the
other
and
when
it
is
a
rainy
day
you
can
see
how
the
rain
slips
and
slides
off
from
these
shingles
and
runs
and
drips
away
from
the
spout
now
on
this
little
house
where
manenko
lives
there
are
no
shingles
but
the
smooth
slippery
grass
is
almost
as
good
and
the
rain
slides
over
it
and
drips
away
hardly
ever
coming
in
to
wet
the
people
inside
or
the
hard
beds
made
of
rushes
like
the
roof
and
spread
upon
the
floor
of
earth
in
this
house
lives
manenko
with
maunka
her
mother
sekomi
her
father
and
zungo
and
shobo
her
two
brothers
they
are
all
very
dark
darker
than
the
brown
baby
i
believe
you
would
call
them
black
but
they
are
not
really
quite
so
their
lips
are
thick
their
noses
broad
and
instead
of
hair
their
heads
are
covered
with
wool
such
as
you
might
see
on
a
black
sheep
this
wool
is
braided
and
twisted
into
little
knots
and
strings
all
over
their
heads
and
bound
with
bits
of
red
string
or
any
thread
they
think
it
looks
beautiful
but
i
am
afraid
we
should
not
agree
with
them
now
we
will
see
what
clothes
they
wear
you
remember
agoonack
who
wore
the
white
because
she
lived
in
the
very
cold
country
and
the
little
brown
baby
who
wore
nothing
but
a
string
of
beads
because
she
lived
in
the
warm
country
manenko
too
lives
in
a
warm
country
and
wears
no
clothes
but
on
her
arms
and
ankles
are
bracelets
and
anklets
with
little
bits
of
copper
and
iron
hanging
to
them
which
tinkle
as
she
walks
and
she
also
like
the
brown
baby
has
beads
for
her
neck
her
father
and
mother
and
zungo
her
brother
have
aprons
and
mantles
of
antelope
skins
and
they
too
wear
bracelets
and
anklets
like
hers
little
shobo
is
quite
a
baby
and
runs
in
the
sunshine
like
his
little
sister
without
clothes
dear
little
shobo
how
funny
and
happy
he
must
look
and
how
fond
he
must
be
of
his
little
sister
and
our
little
sister
manenko
we
have
all
seen
such
little
dark
brothers
and
sisters
his
short
soft
wool
is
not
yet
braided
or
twisted
but
crisps
in
little
close
curls
all
over
his
head
in
the
morning
they
must
be
up
early
for
the
father
is
going
to
hunt
and
zungo
will
go
with
him
the
mother
prepares
the
breakfast
small
cakes
of
bread
made
from
the
pounded
corn
scarlet
beans
eaten
with
honey
and
plenty
of
milk
from
the
brown
cow
she
brings
it
in
a
deep
jug
and
they
dip
in
their
hands
for
spoons
all
the
meat
is
eaten
and
the
men
must
go
out
over
the
broad
grassy
fields
for
more
they
will
find
the
beautiful
young
antelope
so
timid
and
gentle
as
to
be
far
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
would
be
of
them
they
are
somewhat
like
small
deer
striped
and
spotted
and
they
have
large
dark
eyes
so
soft
and
earnest
you
can
not
help
loving
them
here
too
are
the
buffalo
like
large
cows
and
oxen
with
strong
horns
and
the
great
elephants
with
long
trunks
and
tusks
sometimes
even
a
lion
is
to
be
met
roused
from
his
sleep
by
the
noise
of
the
hunters
for
the
lion
sleeps
in
the
daytime
and
generally
walks
abroad
only
at
night
when
you
are
older
you
can
read
the
stories
of
famous
lion
and
elephant
hunters
and
of
strange
and
thrilling
adventures
in
the
dark
continent
it
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
you
and
me
to
see
all
these
strange
or
beautiful
animals
but
zungo
and
his
father
have
seen
them
so
many
times
that
they
are
thinking
only
of
the
meat
they
will
bring
home
and
taking
their
long
spears
and
the
basket
of
ground
nuts
and
meal
which
the
mother
has
made
ready
they
are
off
with
other
hunters
before
the
sun
is
up
now
the
mother
takes
her
hoe
and
calling
her
little
girl
to
help
hoes
the
young
corn
which
is
growing
on
the
round
hill
behind
the
house
i
must
tell
you
something
about
the
little
hill
it
looks
like
any
other
hill
you
would
think
and
could
hardly
believe
that
there
is
anything
very
wonderful
to
tell
about
it
but
listen
to
me
a
great
many
years
ago
there
was
no
hill
there
at
all
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
small
white
ants
you
have
seen
the
little
many
a
time
on
the
and
all
the
ants
at
work
carrying
grains
of
sand
in
their
mouths
and
running
this
way
and
that
as
if
they
were
busy
in
the
most
important
work
oh
the
little
ants
are
very
wise
they
seem
to
know
how
to
contrive
great
things
and
are
never
idle
go
to
the
ant
consider
her
ways
and
be
wise
said
one
of
the
world
wisest
men
well
on
the
spot
where
this
hill
now
stands
the
white
ants
began
to
work
they
were
not
satisfied
with
small
houses
like
those
which
we
have
seen
but
they
worked
day
after
day
week
after
week
and
even
years
until
they
had
built
this
hill
higher
than
the
house
in
which
i
live
and
inside
it
is
full
of
chambers
and
halls
and
wonderful
arched
passages
they
built
this
great
house
but
they
do
not
live
there
now
i
do
know
why
they
moved
perhaps
because
they
like
the
idea
of
having
such
near
neighbors
when
sekomi
began
to
build
his
hut
before
their
door
but
however
it
was
they
went
and
patient
little
creatures
that
they
are
built
another
just
like
it
a
mile
or
so
away
and
sekomi
said
the
hill
is
a
fine
place
to
plant
my
early
corn
there
is
but
little
hoeing
to
do
this
morning
and
while
the
work
goes
on
shobo
the
baby
rolls
in
the
grass
sucking
a
piece
of
as
i
have
seen
children
suck
a
stick
of
candy
you
the
mother
has
baskets
to
make
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
is
a
heap
of
fine
twisting
which
she
brought
from
the
forest
yesterday
and
under
the
shadow
of
her
grassy
roof
she
sits
before
the
door
weaving
them
into
strong
neat
baskets
like
the
one
in
which
the
men
carried
their
dinner
when
they
went
to
hunt
while
she
works
other
women
come
too
with
their
work
sit
beside
her
in
the
shade
and
chatter
away
in
a
very
language
we
could
understand
it
at
all
but
we
should
hear
them
always
call
manenko
mother
meaning
zungo
mother
instead
of
saying
maunka
which
you
remember
i
told
you
is
her
name
zungo
is
her
oldest
boy
you
know
and
ever
since
he
was
born
she
has
been
called
nothing
but
just
as
if
when
a
lady
comes
into
your
school
the
teacher
should
say
this
is
joe
mother
or
this
is
teddy
mamma
so
that
the
children
should
all
know
her
so
the
mother
works
on
the
baskets
and
talks
with
the
women
but
manenko
has
heard
the
call
of
the
the
brisk
little
chirp
of
chiken
chiken
chik
churr
churr
and
she
is
away
to
the
wood
to
follow
his
call
and
bring
home
the
honey
she
runs
beneath
the
tall
trees
looking
up
for
the
small
brown
bird
then
she
stops
and
listens
to
hear
him
again
when
close
beside
her
comes
the
call
chiken
chiken
chik
churr
churr
and
there
sits
the
brown
bird
above
a
hole
in
the
tree
where
the
bees
are
flying
in
and
out
their
legs
yellow
with
it
is
too
high
for
manenko
to
reach
but
she
marks
the
place
and
says
to
herself
i
will
tell
ra
when
he
comes
home
who
is
ra
why
that
is
her
name
for
father
she
turns
to
go
home
but
stops
to
listen
to
the
wild
shouts
and
songs
of
the
women
who
have
left
the
huts
and
are
coming
down
towards
the
river
to
welcome
their
chief
with
lulliloo
praising
him
by
such
strange
names
as
great
lion
great
buffalo
the
chief
comes
from
a
long
journey
with
the
young
men
up
the
river
in
canoes
to
hunt
the
elephant
and
bring
home
the
ivory
tusks
from
which
we
have
many
beautiful
things
made
the
canoes
are
full
of
tusks
and
while
the
men
unload
them
the
women
are
shouting
sleep
my
lord
my
great
chief
manenko
listens
while
she
stands
under
the
trees
listens
for
only
a
minute
and
then
runs
to
join
her
mother
and
add
her
little
voice
to
the
general
noise
the
chief
is
very
proud
and
happy
to
bring
home
such
a
load
before
sunset
it
will
all
be
carried
up
to
the
huts
the
men
will
dress
in
their
very
best
and
walk
in
a
gay
procession
indeed
they
dress
much
no
coats
or
hats
or
nicely
polished
boots
have
they
to
put
on
but
some
will
have
the
white
ends
of
oxen
tails
in
their
hair
some
a
plume
of
black
ostrich
feathers
and
the
chief
himself
has
a
very
grand
cap
made
from
the
yellow
mane
of
an
old
lion
the
drum
will
beat
the
women
will
shout
while
the
men
gather
round
a
fire
and
roast
and
eat
great
slices
of
and
tell
the
story
of
their
famous
how
they
came
to
the
bushes
with
fine
silvery
leaves
and
sweet
bark
which
the
elephant
eats
and
there
hiding
watched
and
waited
many
hours
until
the
ground
shook
with
the
heavy
tread
of
a
great
and
her
two
calves
coming
up
from
the
river
where
they
had
been
to
drink
their
trunks
were
full
of
water
and
they
tossed
them
up
spouting
the
water
like
a
fine
over
their
hot
heads
and
backs
and
now
cooled
and
refreshed
began
to
eat
the
silvery
leaves
of
the
bushes
then
the
hunters
threw
their
spears
thick
and
fast
after
two
hours
the
great
creature
lay
still
upon
the
ground
she
was
dead
so
day
after
day
they
had
hunted
loading
the
canoes
with
ivory
and
sailing
far
up
the
river
far
up
where
the
tall
rushes
wave
twisted
together
by
the
twining
vines
far
up
where
the
alligators
make
great
nests
in
the
and
lay
their
eggs
and
stretch
themselves
in
the
sunshine
half
asleep
inside
their
scaly
armor
far
up
where
the
hippopotamus
is
standing
in
his
drowsy
dream
on
the
bottom
of
the
river
with
the
water
covering
him
head
and
all
he
is
a
great
sleepy
fellow
not
unlike
a
very
large
pig
with
a
thick
skin
and
no
hair
here
he
lives
under
the
water
all
day
only
once
in
a
while
poking
up
his
nose
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
here
is
the
with
her
baby
standing
upon
her
neck
that
he
may
be
nearer
the
top
of
the
water
think
how
funny
he
must
look
all
day
long
they
stand
here
under
the
water
half
asleep
sometimes
giving
a
loud
grunt
or
snore
and
sometimes
i
am
sorry
to
say
tipping
over
a
canoe
which
happens
to
float
over
their
heads
but
at
night
when
men
are
asleep
the
great
beasts
come
up
out
of
the
river
and
eat
the
short
sweet
grass
upon
the
shore
and
look
about
to
see
the
world
a
little
oh
what
mighty
beasts
men
are
so
small
and
weak
beside
them
and
yet
because
the
mind
of
man
is
so
much
above
theirs
he
can
rule
them
for
god
made
man
to
be
king
of
the
whole
earth
and
greater
than
all
all
these
wonderful
things
the
men
have
seen
and
manenko
listens
to
their
stories
until
the
moon
is
high
and
the
stars
have
almost
faded
in
her
light
then
her
father
and
zungo
come
home
bringing
the
antelope
and
buffalo
meat
too
tired
to
tell
their
story
until
the
next
day
so
after
eating
supper
they
are
all
soon
asleep
upon
the
mats
which
form
their
beds
it
is
a
hard
kind
of
bed
but
a
good
one
if
you
do
have
too
many
mice
for
bedfellows
a
little
mouse
is
a
pretty
creature
but
one
does
care
to
sleep
with
him
these
are
simple
happy
people
they
live
out
of
doors
most
of
the
time
and
they
love
the
sunshine
the
rain
and
the
wind
they
have
plenty
to
eat
the
pounded
corn
milk
and
honey
and
scarlet
beans
and
the
hunters
bring
meat
and
soon
it
will
be
time
for
the
wild
to
come
flocking
down
the
river
white
pelicans
and
brown
ducks
and
hundreds
of
smaller
birds
that
chase
the
skimming
flies
over
the
water
if
manenko
could
read
she
would
be
sorry
that
she
has
no
books
and
if
she
knew
what
dolls
are
she
might
be
longing
every
day
for
a
beautiful
wax
doll
with
curling
hair
and
eyes
to
open
and
shut
but
these
are
things
of
which
she
knows
nothing
at
all
and
she
is
happy
enough
in
watching
the
hornets
building
their
hanging
nests
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
cutting
the
small
sticks
of
or
following
the
call
if
the
children
who
have
books
would
oftener
leave
them
and
study
the
wonders
of
the
things
about
them
of
the
birds
the
plants
the
curious
creatures
that
live
and
work
on
the
land
and
in
the
air
and
water
it
would
be
better
for
them
try
it
dear
children
open
your
eyes
and
look
into
the
ways
and
forms
of
life
in
the
midst
of
which
god
has
placed
you
and
get
acquainted
with
them
till
you
feel
that
they
too
are
your
brothers
and
sisters
and
god
your
father
and
theirs
louise
the
child
of
the
beautiful
river
rhine
have
you
heard
of
the
beautiful
river
rhine
how
at
first
it
hides
a
little
brook
among
the
mountains
and
dark
forests
and
then
steals
out
into
the
sunshine
and
leaps
down
the
and
hurries
away
to
the
sea
growing
larger
and
stronger
as
it
runs
curling
and
eddying
among
the
rocks
and
sweeping
between
the
high
hills
where
the
grow
and
the
solemn
old
castles
stand
how
people
come
from
far
and
near
to
see
and
to
sail
upon
the
beautiful
river
and
the
children
who
are
so
blessed
as
to
be
born
near
it
and
to
play
on
its
shores
through
all
the
happy
young
years
of
their
lives
although
they
may
go
far
away
from
it
in
the
after
years
never
never
forget
the
dear
and
beautiful
river
rhine
it
is
only
a
few
miles
away
from
the
rhine
perhaps
too
far
for
you
to
walk
but
not
too
far
for
me
that
we
shall
find
a
fine
large
house
a
house
with
pleasant
gardens
about
it
broad
gravel
walks
and
soft
green
to
play
upon
and
gay
flowering
trees
and
bushes
while
the
are
climbing
over
the
piazza
and
opening
are
peeping
in
at
the
chamber
windows
is
this
a
pleasant
house
i
wish
we
could
all
live
in
as
charming
a
home
by
as
blue
and
lovely
a
river
and
with
as
large
and
sweet
a
garden
or
if
we
might
have
such
a
place
for
our
school
how
delightful
it
would
be
here
lives
louise
my
little
friend
and
here
in
the
garden
she
plays
with
fritz
and
sturdy
little
gretchen
and
here
too
at
evening
the
father
and
mother
come
to
sit
on
the
piazza
among
the
roses
and
the
children
leave
their
games
to
nestle
together
on
the
steps
while
the
dear
brother
christian
plays
softly
and
sweetly
on
his
flute
louise
is
a
motherly
child
already
eight
years
old
and
always
willing
and
glad
to
take
care
of
the
younger
ones
indeed
she
calls
gretchen
baby
and
the
little
one
loves
dearly
her
they
live
in
this
great
house
and
they
have
plenty
of
toys
and
books
and
plenty
of
good
food
and
comfortable
little
beds
to
sleep
in
at
night
although
like
jeannette
they
are
only
neat
little
boxes
built
against
the
side
of
the
wall
but
near
them
in
the
valley
live
the
poor
people
in
small
low
houses
they
eat
black
bread
wear
coarse
clothes
and
even
the
children
must
work
all
day
that
they
may
have
food
for
the
mother
of
louise
is
a
gentle
loving
woman
she
says
to
her
children
dear
children
we
are
rich
we
can
have
all
that
we
want
but
we
will
not
forget
the
poor
you
may
some
day
be
poor
yourselves
and
if
you
learn
now
what
poverty
is
you
will
be
more
ready
to
meet
it
when
it
comes
so
day
after
day
the
great
stove
in
the
kitchen
is
covered
with
and
kettles
in
which
are
cooking
dinners
for
the
sick
and
the
poor
and
day
after
day
as
the
draws
near
louise
will
come
and
fritz
and
even
little
gretchen
saying
mother
may
i
go
may
i
go
and
the
mother
answers
dear
children
you
shall
all
go
together
and
she
fills
the
bowls
and
baskets
and
sends
her
children
down
into
the
valley
to
old
hans
the
gardener
who
has
been
lame
with
rheumatism
so
many
years
and
to
young
marie
the
pale
thin
girl
who
was
so
merry
and
in
the
vineyard
a
year
ago
and
to
the
old
old
woman
with
the
brown
wrinkled
face
and
bowed
head
who
sits
always
in
the
sunshine
before
the
door
and
tries
to
knit
but
the
needles
drop
from
the
poor
trembling
hands
and
the
stitches
slip
off
and
she
can
not
see
to
pick
them
up
she
is
too
deaf
to
hear
the
children
as
they
come
down
the
road
and
she
is
nodding
her
poor
old
head
and
feeling
about
in
her
lap
for
the
lost
needle
when
louise
with
her
bright
eyes
spies
it
picks
it
up
and
before
the
old
woman
knows
she
has
come
a
soft
little
hand
is
laid
in
the
brown
wrinkled
one
and
the
little
girl
is
shouting
in
her
ear
that
she
has
brought
some
dinner
from
mamma
it
makes
a
smile
shine
in
the
old
eyes
it
is
always
the
happiest
part
of
the
day
to
her
when
the
dear
little
lady
comes
with
her
dinner
and
it
made
louise
happy
too
for
nothing
repays
us
so
well
as
what
we
do
unselfishly
for
others
these
summer
days
are
full
of
delight
for
the
children
it
is
not
all
play
for
them
to
be
sure
but
then
work
is
often
even
more
charming
than
play
as
i
think
some
little
girls
know
when
they
have
been
helping
their
mothers
running
of
errands
dusting
the
furniture
and
sewing
little
squares
of
patchwork
that
the
baby
may
have
a
made
entirely
by
her
little
sister
louise
can
knit
and
indeed
every
child
and
woman
in
that
country
knits
you
would
almost
laugh
to
see
how
gravely
the
little
girl
takes
out
her
stocking
for
she
has
really
begun
her
first
stocking
and
sits
on
the
for
an
hour
every
morning
at
work
then
the
little
garden
which
she
calls
her
own
must
be
weeded
the
gardener
would
gladly
do
it
but
louise
has
a
hoe
of
her
own
which
her
father
bought
in
the
spring
and
bringing
it
to
his
little
daughter
said
let
me
see
how
well
my
little
girl
can
take
care
of
her
own
garden
and
the
child
has
tried
very
hard
sometimes
it
is
true
she
would
let
the
weeds
grow
pretty
high
before
they
were
pulled
up
but
on
the
whole
the
garden
promises
well
and
there
are
buds
on
her
bush
it
is
good
to
take
care
of
a
garden
for
besides
the
pleasure
the
flowers
can
bring
us
we
learn
how
watchful
we
must
be
to
root
out
the
weeds
and
how
much
trimming
and
care
the
plants
need
so
we
learn
how
to
watch
over
our
own
hearts
she
has
books
too
and
studies
a
little
each
day
studies
at
home
with
her
mother
for
there
is
no
school
near
enough
for
her
to
go
to
it
and
while
she
and
fritz
are
so
young
their
mother
teaches
them
while
christian
who
is
already
more
than
twelve
years
old
has
gone
to
the
school
upon
that
beautiful
hill
which
can
be
seen
from
chamber
window
the
school
where
a
hundred
boys
and
girls
are
studying
music
for
ever
since
he
was
a
baby
christian
has
loved
music
he
has
sung
the
very
sweetest
little
songs
to
louise
while
she
was
yet
so
young
as
to
lie
in
her
cradle
and
he
has
whistled
until
the
birds
among
the
bushes
would
answer
him
again
and
now
when
he
comes
home
from
school
to
spend
some
long
summer
sunday
he
always
brings
the
flute
and
plays
as
i
told
you
in
the
beginning
of
the
story
when
the
summer
days
are
over
what
comes
next
you
do
not
surely
forget
the
autumn
when
the
leaves
of
the
maples
turn
crimson
and
yellow
and
the
oaks
are
red
and
brown
and
you
scuff
your
feet
along
the
path
in
fallen
leaves
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
the
autumn
is
not
quite
like
ours
you
shall
see
how
our
children
of
the
great
house
will
spend
an
autumn
day
their
father
and
mother
have
promised
to
go
with
them
to
the
vineyards
as
soon
as
the
grapes
are
ripe
enough
for
gathering
and
on
this
sunny
september
morning
the
time
has
really
come
in
the
great
covered
baskets
are
slices
of
bread
and
german
sausage
bottles
of
milk
and
of
beer
and
plenty
of
fresh
and
delicious
prunes
for
the
prune
orchards
are
loaded
with
ripe
fruit
this
is
their
dinner
for
they
will
not
be
home
until
night
oh
what
a
charming
day
for
the
children
little
gretchen
is
rolling
in
the
grass
with
delight
while
louise
runs
to
bring
her
own
little
basket
in
which
to
gather
grapes
they
must
ride
in
the
broad
old
family
carriage
for
the
little
ones
can
not
walk
so
far
but
when
they
reach
the
river
they
will
take
a
boat
with
white
sails
and
go
down
to
where
the
steep
steps
and
path
lead
up
on
the
other
side
up
the
sunny
green
bank
to
the
vineyard
where
already
the
peasant
girls
have
been
at
work
ever
since
sunrise
here
the
grapes
are
hanging
in
heavy
purple
clusters
the
sun
has
warmed
them
through
and
through
and
made
them
sweet
to
the
very
heart
oh
how
delicious
they
are
and
how
beautiful
they
look
heaped
up
in
the
tall
baskets
which
the
girls
and
women
are
carrying
on
their
heads
how
the
children
watch
these
all
dressed
in
neat
little
jackets
and
many
short
skirts
one
above
another
red
and
blue
white
and
green
on
their
heads
are
the
baskets
of
grapes
and
they
never
drop
nor
spill
them
but
carry
them
steadily
down
the
steep
narrow
path
to
the
great
vats
where
the
young
men
stand
on
short
ladders
to
reach
the
top
and
pour
in
the
purple
fruit
then
the
grapes
are
crushed
till
the
purple
juice
runs
out
and
that
is
wine
such
wine
as
even
the
children
may
drink
in
their
little
silver
cups
for
it
is
even
better
than
milk
you
may
be
sure
that
they
have
some
at
when
they
cluster
round
the
flat
rock
below
the
dark
stone
castle
with
the
warm
noonday
sun
streaming
across
their
mossy
table
and
the
mother
opens
the
basket
and
gives
to
every
one
a
share
below
them
is
the
river
with
its
boats
and
beautiful
shining
water
behind
them
are
the
walls
of
that
old
castle
where
two
hundred
years
ago
lived
armed
knights
and
stately
ladies
and
all
about
them
is
the
rich
september
air
full
of
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
grapes
and
echoing
with
the
songs
and
laughter
of
the
on
their
rocky
table
are
purple
bunches
of
fruit
in
their
cups
the
new
and
in
their
hearts
all
the
joy
of
the
merry
grape
season
there
are
many
days
like
this
in
the
autumn
but
the
frost
will
come
at
last
and
the
snow
too
this
is
winter
but
winter
brings
the
best
pleasure
of
all
when
two
weeks
of
the
winter
had
nearly
passed
the
children
as
you
may
suppose
began
to
think
of
christmas
and
indeed
their
best
and
most
loving
friend
had
been
preparing
for
them
the
sweetest
of
christmas
presents
ten
days
before
christmas
it
came
however
can
you
guess
what
it
was
something
for
all
of
them
something
which
christian
will
like
just
as
well
as
little
gretchen
will
and
the
father
and
mother
will
perhaps
be
more
pleased
than
any
one
else
do
you
know
what
it
is
what
do
you
think
of
a
little
baby
brother
a
little
round
sweet
baby
brother
as
a
christmas
present
for
them
all
when
christmas
eve
came
the
mother
said
the
children
must
have
their
in
my
room
for
baby
is
one
of
the
presents
and
i
do
think
i
can
let
him
be
carried
out
and
put
upon
the
table
in
the
hall
where
we
had
it
last
year
so
all
day
long
the
children
are
kept
away
from
their
mother
room
their
father
comes
home
with
his
great
very
full
of
something
but
of
course
the
children
do
know
what
he
comes
and
goes
up
stairs
and
down
and
while
they
are
all
at
play
in
the
snow
a
fine
young
is
brought
in
and
carried
up
louise
knows
it
for
she
picked
up
a
fallen
branch
upon
the
stairs
but
she
tell
fritz
and
gretchen
how
they
all
wait
and
long
for
the
night
to
come
they
sit
at
the
windows
watching
the
red
sunset
light
upon
the
snow
and
can
not
think
of
playing
or
eating
their
supper
the
parlor
door
is
open
and
all
are
waiting
and
listening
a
little
bell
rings
and
in
an
instant
there
is
a
scampering
up
the
broad
stairs
to
the
door
of
room
again
the
little
bell
rings
and
the
door
is
opened
wide
by
their
father
who
stands
hidden
behind
it
at
the
foot
of
their
mother
bed
stands
the
little
tiny
candles
are
burning
all
over
it
like
little
stars
and
glittering
golden
fruits
are
hanging
among
the
branches
on
the
table
are
laid
fritz
sword
and
gretchen
big
doll
they
being
too
heavy
for
the
tree
to
hold
under
the
branches
louise
finds
charming
things
such
a
little
as
it
is
a
delight
to
see
with
a
lock
and
key
and
inside
thimble
and
scissors
and
neat
little
spools
of
silk
and
thread
then
there
are
the
fairy
stories
of
the
old
black
forest
and
that
most
charming
of
all
little
books
the
white
cat
and
an
ivory
cup
and
ball
for
fritz
do
you
remember
where
the
ivory
comes
from
and
lest
baby
hans
should
think
himself
forgotten
there
is
an
ivory
rattle
for
him
there
he
lies
in
the
nurse
arms
his
blue
eyes
wide
open
with
wonder
and
in
a
minute
the
children
with
arms
full
of
presents
have
gathered
round
the
old
woman
gathered
round
the
best
and
sweetest
little
christmas
present
of
all
and
the
happy
mother
who
sits
up
among
the
pillows
taking
her
supper
while
she
watches
her
children
forgets
to
eat
and
leaves
the
gruel
to
grow
cold
but
her
heart
is
warm
enough
why
is
not
christian
here
in
the
school
of
music
away
on
the
hill
he
is
singing
a
grand
christmas
hymn
with
a
hundred
young
voices
to
join
him
it
is
very
grand
and
sweet
full
of
thanks
and
of
love
it
makes
the
little
boy
feel
nearer
to
all
his
loved
ones
and
in
his
heart
he
is
thanking
the
dear
father
who
has
given
them
that
best
little
christmas
present
the
baby
louise
the
child
of
the
western
forest
there
are
many
things
happening
in
this
world
dear
children
things
that
happen
to
you
yourselves
day
after
day
which
you
are
too
young
to
understand
at
the
time
by
and
by
when
you
grow
to
be
as
old
as
i
am
you
will
remember
and
wonder
about
them
all
now
it
was
just
one
of
these
wonderful
things
too
great
for
the
young
children
to
understand
that
happened
to
our
little
louise
and
her
brothers
and
sister
when
the
christmas
time
had
come
around
again
and
the
baby
was
more
than
a
year
old
it
was
a
cold
stormy
night
there
were
great
drifts
of
snow
and
the
wind
was
driving
it
against
the
windows
in
the
beautiful
great
parlor
beside
the
bright
fire
sat
the
sweet
gentle
mother
and
in
her
lap
lay
the
stout
little
hans
the
children
had
their
little
chairs
before
the
fire
and
watched
the
red
and
yellow
flames
while
louise
had
already
taken
out
her
they
were
all
very
still
for
their
father
seemed
sad
and
troubled
and
the
children
were
wondering
what
could
be
the
matter
their
mother
looked
at
them
and
smiled
but
after
all
it
was
only
a
sad
smile
i
think
it
is
hardest
for
the
father
when
he
can
no
longer
give
to
wife
and
children
their
pleasant
home
but
if
they
can
be
courageous
and
happy
when
they
have
to
give
it
up
it
makes
his
heart
easier
and
brighter
i
must
tell
the
children
said
the
father
looking
at
his
wife
and
she
answered
quite
cheerfully
yes
tell
them
they
will
not
be
sad
about
it
i
know
so
the
father
told
to
his
wondering
little
ones
that
he
had
lost
all
his
money
the
beautiful
great
house
and
gardens
were
no
longer
his
and
they
must
all
leave
their
pleasant
home
near
the
rhine
and
cross
the
great
tossing
ocean
to
find
a
new
home
among
the
forests
or
the
prairies
as
you
may
suppose
the
children
did
fully
understand
this
i
do
think
you
would
yourself
you
would
be
quite
delighted
with
the
packing
and
moving
and
the
pleasant
journey
in
the
cars
and
the
new
and
strange
things
you
would
see
on
board
the
ship
and
it
would
be
quite
a
long
time
before
you
could
really
know
what
it
was
to
lose
your
own
dear
home
so
the
children
were
not
sad
you
know
their
mother
said
they
would
not
be
but
when
they
were
safely
tucked
up
in
their
little
beds
and
tenderly
kissed
by
the
most
loving
lips
louise
could
not
go
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
this
strange
moving
and
wondering
what
they
should
carry
and
how
long
they
should
stay
for
she
had
herself
once
been
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
in
the
city
carrying
her
clothes
in
a
new
little
square
trunk
and
riding
fifty
miles
in
the
cars
and
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
a
fine
thing
that
they
should
all
pack
up
trunks
full
of
clothing
and
go
together
on
even
a
longer
journey
a
letter
had
been
written
to
tell
christian
and
the
next
day
he
came
home
from
the
school
his
uncles
in
the
city
begged
him
to
stay
with
them
but
the
boy
said
earnestly
if
my
father
must
cross
the
sea
i
too
must
go
with
him
they
waited
only
for
the
winter
cold
to
pass
away
and
when
the
first
robins
began
to
sing
among
the
naked
trees
they
had
left
the
fine
large
house
left
the
beautiful
gardens
where
the
children
used
to
play
left
the
great
comfortable
and
sofas
the
bookcases
and
tables
and
the
little
beds
beside
the
wall
besides
their
clothes
they
had
taken
nothing
with
them
but
two
great
wooden
chests
full
of
beautiful
linen
sheets
and
these
had
been
given
to
the
mother
by
her
mother
long
ago
before
any
of
the
children
were
born
and
they
must
be
carried
to
the
new
home
you
will
see
by
and
by
how
glad
the
family
all
were
to
have
them
did
you
ever
go
on
board
a
ship
it
is
almost
like
a
great
house
upon
the
water
but
the
rooms
in
it
are
very
small
and
so
are
the
windows
then
there
is
the
long
deck
where
we
may
walk
in
the
fresh
air
and
watch
the
water
and
the
or
the
sailors
at
work
upon
the
high
masts
among
the
ropes
and
the
white
sails
that
spread
out
like
a
white
bird
wings
and
sweep
the
ship
along
over
the
water
it
was
in
such
a
ship
that
our
children
found
themselves
with
their
father
and
mother
when
the
snow
was
gone
and
young
grass
was
beginning
to
spring
up
on
the
land
but
of
this
they
could
see
nothing
for
in
a
day
they
had
flown
on
the
white
wings
far
out
over
the
water
and
as
louise
clung
to
her
father
hand
and
stood
upon
the
deck
at
sunset
she
saw
only
water
and
sky
all
about
on
every
side
and
the
red
clouds
of
the
sunset
it
was
a
little
sad
and
quite
strange
to
her
but
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
were
already
asleep
in
the
small
beds
of
the
ship
which
as
perhaps
you
know
are
built
up
against
the
wall
just
as
their
beds
were
at
home
louise
kissed
her
father
and
went
down
too
to
bed
for
you
must
know
that
on
board
ship
you
go
stairs
to
bed
instead
of
stairs
after
all
if
father
mother
brother
and
sister
can
still
cling
to
each
other
and
love
each
other
it
makes
little
difference
where
they
are
for
love
is
the
best
thing
in
the
universe
and
nothing
is
good
without
it
they
lived
for
many
days
in
the
ship
and
the
children
after
a
little
time
were
not
afraid
to
run
about
the
deck
and
talk
with
the
sailors
who
were
always
very
kind
to
them
and
louise
felt
quite
at
home
sitting
in
her
little
chair
beside
the
great
mast
while
she
knit
upon
her
stocking
a
little
stocking
now
one
for
the
baby
christian
had
brought
his
flute
and
at
night
he
played
to
them
as
he
used
at
home
and
indeed
they
were
all
so
loving
and
happy
together
that
it
was
not
much
sorrow
to
lose
the
home
while
they
kept
each
other
sometimes
a
hard
day
would
come
when
the
clouds
swept
over
them
and
the
rain
and
the
great
waves
tossed
the
ship
making
them
all
sick
and
sad
too
for
a
time
but
the
sun
was
sure
to
come
out
at
last
as
i
can
assure
you
it
always
will
and
on
the
whole
it
was
a
pleasant
journey
for
them
all
it
was
a
fine
sunny
may
day
when
they
reached
the
land
again
no
time
though
for
them
to
go
maying
for
only
see
how
much
is
to
be
done
here
are
all
the
trunks
and
the
and
all
the
children
too
to
be
disposed
of
and
they
are
to
stop
but
two
days
in
this
city
then
they
must
be
ready
for
a
long
journey
in
the
cars
and
steamboats
up
rivers
and
across
lakes
and
sometimes
for
miles
and
miles
through
woods
where
they
see
no
houses
nor
people
excepting
here
and
there
a
single
log
cabin
with
two
or
three
ragged
children
at
play
outside
or
a
baby
creeping
over
the
doorstep
while
farther
on
among
the
trees
stands
a
man
with
his
axe
cutting
with
heavy
blows
some
tall
trees
into
such
logs
as
those
of
which
the
house
is
built
these
are
new
and
strange
sights
to
the
children
of
the
river
rhine
they
wonder
and
often
ask
their
parents
if
they
too
shall
live
in
a
little
log
house
like
that
how
fresh
and
fragrant
the
new
logs
are
for
the
dwelling
and
how
sweet
the
pine
and
spruce
boughs
for
a
bed
a
good
new
log
house
in
the
green
woods
is
the
best
home
in
the
world
oh
how
heartily
tired
they
all
are
when
at
last
they
stop
they
have
been
riding
by
day
and
by
night
the
children
have
fallen
asleep
with
heads
curled
down
upon
their
arms
upon
the
seats
of
the
car
and
the
mother
has
had
very
hard
work
to
keep
little
hans
contented
and
happy
but
here
at
last
they
have
stopped
here
is
the
new
home
they
have
left
the
cars
at
a
very
small
town
it
has
ten
or
twelve
houses
and
one
store
and
they
have
taken
here
a
great
wagon
with
three
horses
to
carry
them
yet
a
few
miles
farther
to
a
lonely
though
beautiful
place
it
is
on
the
edge
of
a
forest
the
trees
are
very
tall
their
trunks
and
when
you
look
far
in
among
them
it
is
so
dark
that
no
sunlight
seems
to
fall
on
the
brown
earth
but
outside
is
sunshine
and
the
young
spring
grass
and
wild
flowers
different
from
those
which
grow
on
the
rhine
banks
but
where
is
their
house
here
is
indeed
something
new
for
them
it
is
almost
night
no
house
is
near
and
they
have
no
but
the
great
wagon
but
their
cheerful
mother
packs
them
all
away
in
the
back
part
of
the
wagon
on
some
straw
covering
them
with
shawls
as
well
as
she
can
and
bids
them
saying
you
can
see
the
stars
whenever
you
open
your
eyes
it
is
a
new
bed
and
a
hard
one
however
the
children
are
tired
enough
to
sleep
well
but
they
woke
very
early
as
you
or
i
certainly
should
if
we
slept
in
the
great
of
the
birds
oh
how
those
birds
of
the
woods
did
begin
to
sing
long
before
sunrise
and
christian
was
out
from
his
part
of
the
bed
in
a
minute
and
off
four
miles
to
the
store
to
buy
some
bread
for
breakfast
an
hour
after
sunrise
he
was
back
again
and
louise
had
gathered
sticks
of
which
her
father
made
a
bright
fire
and
now
the
mother
is
teaching
her
little
daughter
how
to
make
tea
and
fritz
and
gretchen
are
poking
long
sticks
into
the
ashes
to
find
the
potatoes
which
were
hidden
there
to
roast
to
them
it
is
a
beautiful
picnic
like
those
happy
days
in
the
grape
season
but
louise
can
see
that
her
mother
is
a
little
grieved
at
having
them
sleep
in
the
wagon
with
no
house
to
cover
them
and
when
breakfast
is
over
she
says
to
the
father
that
the
children
must
be
taken
back
to
the
village
to
stay
until
the
house
is
built
he
too
had
thought
so
and
the
mother
and
children
go
back
to
the
little
town
christian
alone
stays
with
his
father
working
with
his
small
axe
as
his
father
does
with
the
large
one
but
to
both
it
is
very
hard
work
to
cut
trees
because
it
is
something
they
have
never
done
before
they
do
their
best
and
when
he
is
not
too
tired
christian
whistles
to
cheer
himself
after
the
first
day
a
man
is
hired
to
help
and
it
is
not
a
great
while
before
the
little
house
is
built
built
of
great
rough
logs
still
covered
with
brown
bark
and
moss
all
the
cracks
are
stuffed
with
moss
to
keep
out
the
rain
and
cold
and
there
is
one
window
and
a
door
it
is
a
poor
little
house
to
come
to
after
leaving
the
grand
old
one
by
the
rhine
but
the
children
are
delighted
when
their
father
comes
with
the
great
wagon
to
take
them
to
their
new
home
and
into
this
house
one
summer
night
they
come
without
beds
tables
or
chairs
really
with
nothing
but
the
trunks
and
the
dear
old
see
only
how
very
useful
they
have
become
what
shall
be
the
for
this
first
meal
in
the
new
house
what
but
the
largest
of
the
round
which
they
all
gather
some
sitting
on
blocks
of
wood
and
the
little
ones
standing
and
after
supper
what
shall
they
have
for
beds
what
but
the
good
old
chests
again
for
many
and
many
a
day
and
night
they
are
used
and
the
mother
is
over
and
over
again
thankful
that
she
brought
them
as
the
summer
days
go
by
the
children
pick
berries
in
the
woods
and
meadows
and
fritz
is
feeling
himself
a
great
boy
when
his
father
expects
him
to
take
care
of
the
old
horse
blind
of
one
eye
bought
to
drag
the
loads
of
wood
to
market
louise
is
learning
to
love
the
grand
old
trees
where
the
birds
and
squirrels
live
she
sits
for
hours
with
her
work
on
some
mossy
cushion
under
the
great
waving
boughs
and
she
is
so
silent
and
gentle
that
the
squirrels
learn
to
come
very
near
her
turning
their
heads
every
minute
to
see
if
she
is
watching
and
almost
laughing
at
her
with
their
sharp
bright
eyes
while
they
are
cramming
their
cheeks
full
of
nuts
not
to
eat
now
you
know
but
to
carry
home
to
the
storehouses
in
some
comfortable
hollow
trees
to
be
saved
for
winter
use
when
the
snow
comes
you
see
they
will
not
be
able
to
find
any
nuts
one
day
louise
watched
them
until
she
suddenly
thought
why
do
we
too
save
nuts
for
the
winter
and
the
next
day
she
brought
a
basket
and
the
younger
children
instead
of
her
they
frightened
away
the
squirrels
to
be
sure
but
they
carried
home
a
fine
large
basketful
of
nuts
oh
how
much
might
be
seen
in
those
woods
on
a
summer
day
birds
and
flowers
and
such
beautiful
moss
i
have
seen
it
myself
so
soft
and
thick
better
than
the
softest
cushion
to
sit
on
and
then
so
lovely
to
look
at
with
its
long
bright
feathers
of
green
sometimes
louise
has
seen
the
quails
going
out
for
a
walk
the
mother
with
her
seven
babies
all
tripping
primly
along
behind
her
the
wee
brown
birds
and
all
running
in
a
minute
if
they
hear
a
noise
among
the
bushes
and
hiding
each
one
his
head
under
a
broad
leaf
thinking
poor
little
foolish
things
that
no
one
can
see
them
christian
whistles
to
the
quails
a
long
low
call
they
will
look
this
way
and
that
and
listen
and
at
last
really
run
towards
him
without
fear
before
winter
comes
the
log
house
is
made
more
comfortable
beds
and
chairs
are
bought
and
a
great
fire
burns
in
the
fireplace
but
do
the
best
they
can
the
rain
will
beat
in
between
the
logs
and
after
the
first
snowstorm
one
night
a
white
pointed
drift
is
found
on
the
they
laugh
at
it
and
call
it
but
they
almost
feel
more
like
crying
with
cold
blue
fingers
and
toes
that
even
the
warm
knit
stockings
ca
keep
comfortable
never
mind
the
swift
snowshoes
will
make
them
skim
over
the
like
birds
flying
and
the
merry
that
brother
christian
will
give
them
will
make
up
for
all
the
trouble
they
will
soon
love
the
winter
in
the
snowy
woods
their
clothes
too
are
all
wearing
out
fritz
comes
to
his
mother
with
great
holes
in
his
and
poor
christian
knees
are
blue
and
through
the
torn
trousers
what
shall
be
done
louise
brings
out
two
old
coats
of
her
father
christian
is
wrapped
in
one
from
head
to
foot
and
fritz
looks
like
the
oddest
little
man
with
his
great
coat
muffled
around
him
crossed
in
front
and
buttoned
around
behind
while
the
long
sleeves
can
be
turned
back
almost
to
his
shoulders
funny
enough
he
looks
but
it
makes
him
quite
warm
and
in
this
biting
wind
who
would
think
of
the
looks
so
our
little
friend
is
to
drive
poor
old
major
to
town
with
a
of
wood
every
day
while
his
father
and
brother
are
cutting
trees
in
the
forest
should
you
laugh
to
see
a
boy
so
dressed
coming
up
the
street
with
a
load
of
wood
perhaps
you
would
if
you
knew
how
cold
he
would
be
without
this
coat
and
how
much
he
hopes
to
get
the
for
his
wood
and
bring
home
bread
and
meat
for
supper
how
wise
the
children
grow
in
this
hard
work
and
hard
life
fritz
feels
himself
a
little
man
and
louise
i
am
sure
is
as
useful
as
many
a
woman
for
she
is
learning
to
cook
and
tend
the
fire
while
even
gretchen
has
some
garters
to
knit
and
takes
quite
good
care
of
the
baby
little
hans
will
never
remember
the
great
house
by
the
rhine
he
was
too
little
when
they
came
away
but
by
and
by
he
will
like
to
hear
stories
about
it
which
you
may
be
sure
louise
will
often
tell
her
little
brother
the
winter
is
the
hardest
time
when
christmas
comes
there
is
not
even
a
tree
for
there
are
no
candles
to
light
one
and
no
presents
to
give
but
there
is
one
beautiful
gift
which
they
may
and
do
all
give
to
each
other
it
makes
them
happier
than
many
toys
or
books
it
is
love
it
makes
even
this
cold
dreary
christmas
bright
and
beautiful
to
them
next
winter
will
not
be
so
hard
for
in
the
spring
corn
will
be
planted
and
plenty
of
potatoes
and
turnips
and
cabbages
and
they
will
have
enough
to
eat
and
something
to
sell
for
money
but
i
must
not
stay
to
tell
you
more
now
of
the
backwoods
life
of
louise
and
her
brothers
and
sister
if
you
travel
some
day
to
the
west
perhaps
you
will
see
her
yourself
gathering
her
nuts
under
the
trees
or
sitting
in
the
sun
on
the
doorstep
with
her
knitting
then
you
will
know
her
for
the
little
sister
who
has
perhaps
come
closest
to
your
heart
and
you
will
clasp
each
other
hands
in
true
affection
the
seven
little
sisters
here
dear
children
are
your
seven
little
sisters
let
us
count
them
over
first
came
the
brown
baby
then
agoonack
gemila
jeannette
manenko
and
louise
seven
little
sisters
i
have
called
them
but
marnie
exclaims
how
can
they
be
sisters
when
some
are
black
some
brown
and
some
white
when
one
lives
in
the
warm
country
and
another
in
the
cold
and
louise
upon
the
shores
of
the
rhine
sallie
and
i
are
sisters
because
we
have
the
same
father
and
live
here
together
in
the
same
house
by
the
seaside
but
as
for
those
seven
children
i
ca
believe
them
to
be
sisters
at
all
now
let
us
suppose
my
dear
little
girl
that
your
sister
sallie
should
go
away
far
away
in
a
ship
across
the
ocean
to
the
warm
countries
and
the
sun
should
burn
her
face
and
hands
and
make
them
so
brown
that
you
would
hardly
know
her
would
she
still
be
your
sister
sallie
and
suppose
even
that
she
should
stay
away
in
the
warm
countries
and
never
come
back
again
would
she
still
be
your
dear
sister
and
would
you
write
her
letters
and
tell
her
about
home
and
all
that
you
love
there
i
know
you
would
and
now
just
think
if
you
yourself
should
take
a
great
journey
through
ice
and
snow
and
go
to
the
cold
countries
up
among
the
white
bears
and
the
sledges
and
dogs
suppose
even
that
you
should
have
an
odd
little
dress
of
white
like
agoonack
would
you
think
it
very
strange
if
sallie
should
call
you
her
little
sister
just
because
you
were
living
up
there
among
the
ice
and
what
if
minnie
too
should
take
it
into
her
head
to
sail
across
the
seas
and
live
in
a
boat
on
a
chinese
river
like
and
drive
the
ducks
eat
rice
with
chopsticks
and
have
fried
mice
for
dinner
why
you
might
not
want
to
dine
with
her
but
she
would
be
your
sweet
loving
sister
all
the
same
would
she
i
can
hear
you
say
yes
to
all
this
but
then
you
will
add
father
is
our
father
the
same
all
the
time
and
he
is
father
nor
manenko
let
us
see
what
makes
you
think
he
is
your
father
because
he
loves
you
so
much
and
gives
you
everything
that
you
have
clothes
to
wear
and
food
to
eat
and
fire
to
warm
you
did
he
give
you
this
new
little
gingham
frock
shall
we
see
what
it
is
made
of
if
you
ravel
out
one
end
of
the
cloth
you
can
find
the
little
threads
of
cotton
which
are
woven
together
to
make
your
frock
where
did
the
cotton
come
from
it
grew
in
the
hot
fields
of
the
south
where
the
sun
shines
very
warmly
your
father
did
make
it
grow
neither
did
any
man
it
is
true
a
man
a
poor
black
man
and
a
very
sad
man
he
was
too
put
the
little
seeds
into
the
ground
but
they
would
never
have
grown
if
the
sun
had
shone
the
soft
earth
nourished
and
the
rain
moistened
them
and
who
made
the
earth
and
sent
the
sun
and
the
rain
that
must
be
somebody
very
kind
and
thoughtful
to
take
so
much
care
of
the
little
i
think
that
must
be
a
father
now
what
did
you
have
for
breakfast
this
morning
a
sweet
indian
cake
with
your
egg
and
mug
of
milk
i
thought
so
who
made
this
breakfast
did
bridget
make
the
cake
in
the
kitchen
yes
she
mixed
the
meal
with
milk
and
salt
and
sugar
but
where
did
she
get
the
meal
the
miller
ground
the
yellow
corn
to
make
it
but
who
made
the
corn
the
seeds
were
planted
as
the
cottonseeds
were
and
the
same
kind
care
supplied
sun
and
rain
and
earth
for
them
was
that
a
father
not
your
father
who
sits
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
helps
you
at
dinner
who
takes
you
to
walk
and
tells
you
stories
but
another
father
your
father
too
he
must
be
for
he
is
certainly
taking
care
of
you
and
does
he
make
the
corn
grow
also
on
that
behind
manenko
house
he
seems
to
take
the
same
care
of
her
as
of
you
then
the
milk
and
the
egg
they
come
from
the
hen
and
the
cow
but
who
made
the
hen
and
the
cow
it
was
the
same
kind
father
again
who
made
them
for
you
and
made
the
camels
and
goats
for
gemila
and
jeannette
who
made
also
the
wild
bees
and
taught
them
to
store
their
honey
in
the
trees
for
manenko
who
made
the
white
rice
grow
and
ripen
for
little
and
the
and
the
seals
for
agoonack
to
every
one
good
food
to
eat
and
more
than
that
for
must
it
not
be
a
very
loving
father
who
has
made
for
us
all
the
beautiful
sky
and
the
stars
at
night
and
the
blue
sea
who
sent
the
soft
wind
to
rock
the
brown
baby
to
sleep
and
sing
her
a
song
and
the
grand
march
of
the
northern
lights
for
agoonack
grander
and
more
beautiful
than
any
of
the
fireworks
you
know
the
red
strawberries
for
little
jeannette
to
gather
and
the
beautiful
chestnut
woods
on
the
do
you
remember
all
these
things
in
the
stories
and
was
it
the
same
tender
love
that
made
the
sparkling
water
and
sunshine
for
and
the
shining
brown
ducks
for
her
too
the
springs
in
the
desert
and
the
for
gemila
as
well
as
the
warm
sunshine
for
manenko
and
the
beautiful
river
rhine
for
louise
it
must
be
a
very
dear
father
who
gives
his
children
not
only
all
they
need
for
food
and
clothing
but
so
many
many
beautiful
things
to
enjoy
do
you
see
that
they
must
all
be
his
children
and
so
all
sisters
and
that
he
is
your
father
too
who
makes
the
mayflowers
bloom
and
the
violets
cover
the
hills
and
turns
the
white
blossoms
into
black
sweet
berries
in
the
autumn
it
is
your
dear
and
kind
father
who
does
all
this
for
his
children
he
has
very
many
children
some
of
them
live
in
houses
and
some
in
tents
some
in
little
huts
and
some
under
the
trees
in
the
warm
countries
and
in
the
cold
and
he
loves
them
all
they
are
his
children
and
they
are
brothers
and
sisters
shall
they
not
love
each
other
