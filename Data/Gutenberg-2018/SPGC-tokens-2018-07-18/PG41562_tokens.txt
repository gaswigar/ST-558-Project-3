when

then
one
day
he
saw
hanging
in
the
town
square
five
ed

washed
up
tossed
on
his
hat
and
coat
got
his
car
out
and
headed
across
town
toward
his
tv
sales
store
he
was
tired
his
back
and
shoulders
ached
from
digging
dirt
out
of
the
basement
and
wheeling
it
into
the
back
yard
but
for
a
man
he
had
done
okay
janet
could
get
a
new
vase
with
the
money
he
had
saved
and
he
liked
the
idea
of
repairing
the
foundations
himself
it
was
getting
dark
the
setting
sun
cast
long
rays
over
the
scurrying
commuters
tired
and
women
loaded
down
with
bundles
and
packages
students
swarming
home
from
the
university
mixing
with
clerks
and
businessmen
and
drab
secretaries
he
stopped
his
packard
for
a
red
light
and
then
started
it
up
again
the
store
had
been
open
without
him
he
arrive
just
in
time
to
spell
the
help
for
dinner
go
over
the
records
of
the
day
maybe
even
close
a
couple
of
sales
himself
he
drove
slowly
past
the
small
square
of
green
in
the
center
of
the
street
the
town
park
there
were
no
parking
places
in
front
of
loyce
tv
sales
and
service
he
cursed
under
his
breath
and
swung
the
car
in
a
again
he
passed
the
little
square
of
green
with
its
lonely
drinking
fountain
and
bench
and
single
lamppost
from
the
lamppost
something
was
hanging
a
shapeless
dark
bundle
swinging
a
little
with
the
wind
like
a
dummy
of
some
sort
loyce
rolled
down
his
window
and
peered
out
what
the
hell
was
it
a
display
of
some
kind
sometimes
the
chamber
of
commerce
put
up
displays
in
the
square
again
he
made
a
and
brought
his
car
around
he
passed
the
park
and
concentrated
on
the
dark
bundle
it
was
a
dummy
and
if
it
was
a
display
it
was
a
strange
kind
the
hackles
on
his
neck
rose
and
he
swallowed
uneasily
sweat
slid
out
on
his
face
and
hands
it
was
a
body
a
human
body
look
at
it
loyce
snapped
come

with
dignity

big
deal
ed
i
ca
just
leave
the
guy
standing
there

ed
pointed
into
the
gathering
gloom
the
lamppost
jutted
up
against
the
sky
the
post
and
the
bundle
swinging
from
it
there
it
is
how
the
hell
long
has
it
been
there
his
voice
rose
excitedly
wrong
with
everybody
they
just
walk
on
past
don
fergusson
lit
a
cigarette
slowly
take
it
easy
old
man

off
joining
the
flow
of
people
moving
along
the
sidewalk
men
and
women
passing
by
the
park
a
few
glanced
up
curiously
at
the
dark
bundle
and
then
went
on
nobody

any
attention
i
going

whispered
he
made
his
way
to
the
curb
and
crossed
out
into
traffic
among
the
cars
horns
honked
angrily
at
him
he
gained
the
curb
and
stepped
up
onto
the
little
square
of
green
the
man

been

ripped
and
torn

and
caked
with

mud
a

him
before
not
a
local
man
his
face
was
partly
turned
away
and
in
the
evening
wind
he
spun
a
little
turning
gently
silently
his
skin
was
gouged
and
cut
red
gashes
deep
scratches
of
congealed
blood
a
pair
of
glasses
hung
from
one
ear
dangling
foolishly
his
eyes
bulged
his
mouth
was
open
tongue
thick
and
ugly
blue
for
heaven
sake
loyce
muttered
sickened
he
pushed
down
his
nausea
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
sidewalk
he
was
shaking
all
over
with
revulsion
and
fear
who
was
the
man
why
was
he
hanging
there

bumped
into

fought

way
through
the
people
he
stumbled
and
half
fell
through
a
blur
he
saw
rows
of
faces
curious
concerned
anxious
men
and
women
halting
to
see
what
the
disturbance
was
he
fought
past
them
toward

murmur

screamed

respectfully
for
the
two
cops
moving
efficiently
toward
loyce

the
cop
with
the
notebook
murmured
loyce
he
mopped
his
forehead
wearily
edward
loyce
listen
to
me
back
there
address
the
cop
demanded
the
police
car
moved
swiftly
through
traffic
shooting
among
the
cars
and
buses
loyce
sagged
against
the
seat
exhausted
and
confused
he
took
a
deep
shuddering
breath
hurst
road
that
here
in
pikeville
that
right
loyce
pulled
himself
up
with
a
violent
effort
listen
to
me
back
there
in
the
square
hanging
from
the
lamppost
where
were
you
today
the
cop
behind
the
wheel
demanded
where
loyce
echoed
you
were
in
your
shop
were
you
no
he
shook
his
head
no
i
was
home
down
in
the
basement
in
the
digging
a
new
foundation
getting
out
the
dirt
to
pour
a
cement
frame
why
what
has
that
to
do
with
was
anybody
else
down
there
with
you
no
my
wife
was
downtown
my
kids
were
at
school
loyce
looked
from
one
cop
to
the
other
hope
flicked
across
his
face
wild
hope
you
mean
because
i
was
down
there
i
missed
the
explanation
i
get
in
on
it
like
everybody
else
after
a
pause
the
cop
with
the
notebook
said
that
right
you
missed
the
explanation
then
it
official
the
body
it
to
be
hanging
there
it
supposed
to
be
hanging
there
for
everybody
to
see
ed
loyce
grinned
weakly
good
lord
i
guess
i
sort
of
went
off
the
deep
end
i
thought
maybe
something
had
happened
you
know
something
like
the
ku
klux
klan
some
kind
of
violence
communists
or
fascists
taking
over
he
wiped
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
his
hands
shaking
i
glad
to
know
it
on
the
level
it
on
the
level
the
police
car
was
getting
near
the
hall
of
justice
the
sun
had
set
the
streets
were
gloomy
and
dark
the
lights
had
not
yet
come
on
i
feel
better
loyce
said
i
was
pretty
excited
there
for
a
minute
i
guess
i
got
all
stirred
up
now
that
i
understand
there
no
need
to
take
me
in
is
there
the
two
cops
said
nothing
i
should
be
back
at
my
store
the
boys
have
had
dinner
i
all
right
now
no
more
trouble
is
there
any
need
of
this
wo
take
long
the
cop
behind
the
wheel
interrupted
a
short
process
only
a
few
minutes
i
hope
it
short
loyce
muttered
the
car
slowed
down
for
a
stoplight
i
guess
i
sort
of
disturbed
the
peace
funny
getting
excited
like
that
and
loyce
yanked
the
door
open
he
sprawled
out
into
the
street
and
rolled
to
his
feet
cars
were
moving
all
around
him
gaining
speed
as
the
light
changed
loyce
leaped
onto
the
curb
and
raced
among
the
people
burrowing
into
the
swarming
crowds
behind
him
he
heard
sounds
shouts
people
running
they
were
cops
he
had
realized
that
right
away
he
knew
every
cop
in
pikeville
a
man
could
own
a
store
operate
a
business
in
a
small
town
for
years
without
getting
to
know
all
the
cops
they
were
cops
and
there
had
been
any
explanation
potter
fergusson
jenkins
none
of
them
knew
why
it
was
there
they
know
and
they
did
care
was
the
strange
part
loyce
ducked
into
a
hardware
store
he
raced
toward
the
back
past
the
startled
clerks
and
customers
into
the
shipping
room
and
through
the
back
door
he
tripped
over
a
garbage
can
and
ran
up
a
flight
of
concrete
steps
he
climbed
over
a
fence
and
jumped
down
on
the
other
side
gasping
and
panting
there
was
no
sound
behind
him
he
had
got
away
he
was
at
the
entrance
of
an
alley
dark
and
strewn
with
boards
and
ruined
boxes
and
tires
he
could
see
the
street
at
the
far
end
a
street
light
wavered
and
came
on
men
and
women
stores
neon
signs
cars
and
to
his
right
the
police
station
he
was
close
terribly
close
past
the
loading
platform
of
a
grocery
store
rose
the
white
concrete
side
of
the
hall
of
justice
barred
windows
the
police
antenna
a
great
concrete
wall
rising
up
in
the
darkness
a
bad
place
for
him
to
be
near
he
was
too
close
he
had
to
keep
moving
get
farther
away
from
them
loyce
moved
cautiously
down
the
alley
beyond
the
police
station
was
the
city
hall
the
yellow
structure
of
wood
and
gilded
brass
and
broad
cement
steps
he
could
see
the
endless
rows
of
offices
dark
windows
the
cedars
and
beds
of
flowers
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
and
something
else
above
the
city
hall
was
a
patch
of
darkness
a
cone
of
gloom
denser
than
the
surrounding
night
a
prism
of
black
that
spread
out
and
was
lost
into
the
sky
he
listened
good
god
he
could
hear
something
something
that
made
him
struggle
frantically
to
close
his
ears
his
mind
to
shut
out
the
sound
a
buzzing
a
distant
muted
hum
like
a
great
swarm
of
bees
loyce
gazed
up
rigid
with
horror
the
splotch
of
darkness
hanging
over
the
city
hall
darkness
so
thick
it
seemed
almost
solid
the
vortex
something
flickering
shapes
things
descending
from
the
sky
pausing
momentarily
above
the
city
hall
fluttering
over
it
in
a
dense
swarm
and
then
dropping
silently
onto
the
roof
shapes
fluttering
shapes
from
the
sky
from
the
crack
of
darkness
that
hung
above
him
he
was
seeing
them
for
a
long
time
loyce
watched
crouched
behind
a
sagging
fence
in
a
pool
of
scummy
water
they
were
landing
coming
down
in
groups
landing
on
the
roof
of
the
city
hall
and
disappearing
inside
they
had
wings
like
giant
insects
of
some
kind
they
flew
and
fluttered
and
came
to
rest
and
then
crawled
sideways
across
the
roof
and
into
the
building
he
was
sickened
and
fascinated
cold
night
wind
blew
around
him
and
he
shuddered
he
was
tired
dazed
with
shock
on
the
front
steps
of
the
city
hall
were
men
standing
here
and
there
groups
of
men
coming
out
of
the
building
and
halting
for
a
moment
before
going
on
were
there
more
of
them
it
did
seem
possible
what
he
saw
descending
from
the
black
chasm
were
men
they
were
alien
from
some
other
world
some
other
dimension
sliding
through
this
slit
this
break
in
the
shell
of
the
universe
entering
through
this
gap
winged
insects
from
another
realm
of
being
on
the
steps
of
the
city
hall
a
group
of
men
broke
up
a
few
moved
toward
a
waiting
car
one
of
the
remaining
shapes
started
to
the
city
hall
it
changed
its
mind
and
turned
to
follow
the
others
loyce
closed
his
eyes
in
horror
his
senses
reeled
he
hung
on
tight
clutching
at
the
sagging
fence
the
shape
the
had
abruptly
fluttered
up
and
flapped
after
the
others
it
flew
to
the
sidewalk
and
came
to
rest
among
them
imitation
men
insects
with
ability
to
disguise
themselves
as
men
like
other
insects
familiar
to
earth
protective
coloration
mimicry
loyce
pulled
himself
away
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
it
was
night
the
alley
was
totally
dark
but
maybe
they
could
see
in
the
dark
maybe
darkness
made
no
difference
to
them
he
left
the
alley
cautiously
and
moved
out
onto
the
street
men
and
women
flowed
past
but
not
so
many
now
at
the
stood
waiting
groups
a
huge
bus
lumbered
along
the
street
its
lights
flashing
in
the
evening
gloom
loyce
moved
forward
he
pushed
his
way
among
those
waiting
and
when
the
bus
halted
he
boarded
it
and
took
a
seat
in
the
rear
by
the
door
a
moment
later
the
bus
moved
into
life
and
rumbled
down
the
street
loyce
relaxed
a
little
he
studied
the
people
around
him
dulled
tired
faces
people
going
home
from
work
quite
ordinary
faces
none
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
him
all
sat
quietly
sunk
down
in
their
seats
jiggling
with
the
motion
of
the
bus
the
man
sitting
next
to
him
unfolded
a
newspaper
he
began
to
read
the
sports
section
his
lips
moving
an
ordinary
man
blue
suit
tie
a
businessman
or
a
salesman
on
his
way
home
to
his
wife
and
family
across
the
aisle
a
young
woman
perhaps
twenty
dark
eyes
and
hair
a
package
on
her
lap
nylons
and
heels
red
coat
and
white
angora
sweater
gazing
absently
ahead
of
her
a
high
school
boy
in
jeans
and
black
jacket
a
great
woman
with
an
immense
shopping
bag
loaded
with
packages
and
parcels
her
thick
face
dim
with
weariness
ordinary
people
the
kind
that
rode
the
bus
every
evening
going
home
to
their
families
to
dinner
going
home
with
their
minds
dead
controlled
filmed
over
with
the
mask
of
an
alien
being
that
had
appeared
and
taken
possession
of
them
their
town
their
lives
himself
too
except
that
he
happened
to
be
deep
in
his
cellar
instead
of
in
the
store
somehow
he
had
been
overlooked
they
had
missed
him
their
control
was
perfect
foolproof
maybe
there
were
others
hope
flickered
in
loyce
they
were
omnipotent
they
had
made
a
mistake
not
got
control
of
him
their
net
their
field
of
control
had
passed
over
him
he
had
emerged
from
his
cellar
as
he
had
gone
down
apparently
their
was
limited
a
few
seats
down
the
aisle
a
man
was
watching
him
loyce
broke
off
his
chain
of
thought
a
slender
man
with
dark
hair
and
a
small
mustache
brown
suit
and
shiny
shoes
a
book
between
his
small

intently
he
turned
quickly

had
missed
the
man

watching

again
small
dark
eyes

too
shrewd
for
them
or
one
of
the
things
itself
an
alien
insect
from
beyond
the
bus
halted
an
elderly
man
got
on
slowly
and
dropped
his
token
into
the
box
he
moved
down
the
aisle
and
took
a
seat
opposite
loyce
the
elderly
man
caught
the
man
gaze
for
a
split
second
something
passed
between
them
a
look
rich
with
meaning
loyce
got
to
his
feet
the
bus
was
moving
he
ran
to
the
door
one
step
down
into
the
well
he
yanked
the
emergency
door
release
the
rubber
door
swung
open
hey
the
driver
shouted
jamming
on
the
brakes
what
the
hell

squirmed
through
the
bus
was
slowing
down
houses
on
all
sides
a
residential
district
lawns
and
tall
apartment
buildings
behind
him
the
man
had
leaped
up
the
elderly
man
was
also
on
his
feet
they
were
coming
after
him
loyce
leaped
he
hit
the
pavement
with
terrific
force
and
rolled
against
the
curb
pain
lapped
over
him
pain
and
a
vast
tide
of
blackness
desperately
he
fought
it
off
he
struggled
to
his
knees
and
then
slid
down
again
the
bus
had
stopped
people
were
getting
off
loyce
groped
around
his
fingers
closed
over
something
a
rock
lying
in
the
gutter
he
crawled
to
his
feet
grunting
with
pain
a
shape
loomed
before
him
a
man
the
man
with
the
book
loyce
kicked
the
man
gasped
and
fell
loyce
brought
the
rock
down

and
tried
to
roll
away
for
god

listen
he
struck
again
a
hideous
crunching
sound
the
man
voice
cut
off
and
dissolved
in
a
bubbling
wail
loyce
scrambled
up
and
back
the
others
were
there
now
all
around
him
he
ran
awkwardly
down
the
sidewalk
up
a
driveway
none
of
them
followed
him
they
had
stopped
and
were
bending
over
the
inert
body
of
the
man
with
the
book
the
man
who
had
come
after
him
had
he
made
a
mistake
but
it
was
too
late
to
worry
about
that
he
had
to
get
out
away
from
them
out
of
pikeville
beyond
the
crack
of
darkness

he
heard
the
buzz
and
dropped
instantly
the
long
butcher
knife
out
sickened
he
saw
it
coming
down
the
stairs
at
him
wings
a
blur
of
motion
as
it
aimed
itself
it
still
bore
a
vague
resemblance
to
jimmy
it
was
small
a
baby
one
a
brief
glimpse
the
thing
hurtling
at
him
cold
inhuman
eyes
wings
body
still
clothed
in
yellow
and
jeans
the
mimic
outline
still
stamped
on
it
a
strange
of
its
body
as
it
reached
him
what
was
it
doing
a
stinger
loyce
stabbed
wildly
at
it
it
retreated
buzzing
frantically
loyce
rolled
and
crawled
toward
the
door
tommy
and
janet
stood
still
as
statues
faces
blank
watching
without
expression
loyce
stabbed
again
this
time
the
knife
connected
the
thing
shrieked
and
faltered
it
bounced
against
the
wall
and
fluttered
down
something
lapped
through
his
mind
a
wall
of
force
energy
an
alien
mind
probing
into
him
he
was
suddenly
paralyzed
the
mind
entered
his
own
touched
against
him
briefly
shockingly
an
utterly
alien
presence
settling
over
him
and
then
it
flickered
out
as
the
thing
collapsed
in
a
broken
heap
on
the
rug
it
was
dead
he
turned
it
over
with
his
foot
it
was
an
insect
a
fly
of
some
kind
yellow
jeans
his
son
jimmy
he
closed
his
mind
tight
it
was
too
late
to
think
about
that
savagely
he
scooped
up
his
knife
and
headed
toward
the
door
janet
and
tommy
stood
neither
of
them
moving
the
car
was
out
he
never
get
through
they
be
waiting
for
him
it
was
ten
miles
on
foot
ten
long
miles
over
rough
ground
gulleys
and
open
fields
and
hills
of
uncut
forest
he
have
to
go
alone
loyce
opened
the
door
for
a
brief
second
he
looked
back
at
his
wife
and
son
then
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
raced
down
the
porch
steps
a
moment
later
he
was
on
his
way
hurrying
swiftly
through
the
darkness
toward
the
edge
of
town
the
early
morning
sunlight
was
blinding
loyce
halted
gasping
for
breath
swaying
back
and
forth
sweat
ran
down
in
his
eyes
his
clothing
was
torn
shredded
by
the
brush
and
thorns
through
which
he
had
crawled
ten
miles
on
his
hands
and
knees
crawling
creeping
through
the
night
his
shoes
were
he
was
scratched
and
limping
utterly
exhausted
but
ahead
of
him
lay
oak
grove
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
started
down
the
hill
twice
he
stumbled
and
fell
picking
himself
up
and
trudging
on
his
ears
rang
everything
receded
and
wavered
but
he
was
there
he
had
got
out
away
from
pikeville
a
farmer
in
a
field
gaped
at
him
from
a
house
a
young
woman
watched
in
wonder
loyce
reached
the
road
and
turned
onto
it
ahead
of
him
was
a
gasoline
station
and
a
a
couple
of
trucks
some
chickens
pecking
in
the
dirt
a
dog
tied
with
a
string
the
attendant
watched
suspiciously
as
he
dragged
himself
up
to
the
station
thank
god
he
caught
hold
of
the
wall
i
did
think
i
was
going
to
make
it
they
followed
me
most
of
the
way
i
could
hear
them
buzzing
buzzing
and
flitting
around
behind
me
what
happened
the
attendant
demanded
you
in
a
wreck
a
loyce
shook
his
head
wearily
they
have
the
whole
town
the
city
hall
and
the
police
station
they
hung
a
man
from
the
lamppost
that
was
the
first
thing
i
saw
they
got
all
the
roads
blocked
i
saw
them
hovering
over
the
cars
coming
in
about
four
this
morning
i
got
beyond
them
i
knew
it
right
away
i
could
feel
them
leave
and
then
the
sun
came
up
the
attendant
licked
his
lip
nervously
you
out
of
your
head
i
better
get
a
doctor
get
me
into
oak
grove
loyce
gasped
he
sank
down
on
the
gravel
we
got
to
get
started
cleaning
them
out
got
to
get
started
right
away
they
kept
a
tape
recorder
going
all
the
time
he
talked
when
he
had
finished
the
commissioner
snapped
off
the
recorder
and
got
to
his
feet
he
stood
for
a
moment
deep
in
thought
finally
he
got
out
his
cigarettes
and
lit
up
slowly
a
frown
on
his
beefy
face
you
do
believe
me
loyce
said
the
commissioner
offered
him
a
cigarette
loyce
pushed
it
impatiently
away
suit
yourself
the
commissioner
moved
over
to
the
window
and
stood
for
a
time
looking
out
at
the
town
of
oak
grove
i
believe
you
he
said
abruptly
loyce
sagged
thank
god
so
you
got
away
the
commissioner
shook
his
head
you
were
down
in
your
cellar
instead
of
at
work
a
freak
chance
one
in
a
million
loyce
sipped
some
of
the
black
coffee
they
had
brought
him
i
have
a
theory
he
murmured
what
is
it
about
them
who
they
are
they
take
over
one
area
at
a
time
starting
at
the
top
the
highest
level
of
authority
working
down
from
there
in
a
widening
circle
when
they
firmly
in
control
they
go
on
to
the
next
town
they
spread
slowly
very
gradually
i
think
it
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
a
long
time
thousands
of
years
i
do
think
it
new
why
do
you
say
that
when
i
was
a
kid
a
picture
they
showed
us
in
bible
league
a
religious
picture
an
old
print
the
enemy
gods
defeated
by
jehovah
moloch
beelzebub
moab
baalin
ashtaroth
so
they
were
all
represented
by
figures
loyce
looked
up
at
the
commissioner
beelzebub
was
represented
as
a
giant
fly
the
commissioner
grunted
an
old
struggle
they
been
defeated
the
bible
is
an
account
of
their
defeats
they
make
gains
but
finally
they
defeated
why
defeated
they
ca
get
everyone
they
did
get
me
and
they
never
got
the
hebrews
the
hebrews
carried
the
message
to
the
whole
world
the
realization
of
the
danger
the
two
men
on
the
bus
i
think
they
understood
had
escaped
like
i
did
he
clenched
his
fists
i
killed
one
of
them
i
made
a
mistake
i
was
afraid
to
take
a
chance
the
commissioner
nodded
yes
they
undoubtedly
had
escaped
as
you
did
freak
accidents
but
the
rest
of
the
town
was
firmly
in
control
he
turned
from
the
window
well
loyce
you
seem
to
have
figured
everything
out
not
everything
the
hanging
man
the
dead
man
hanging
from
the
lamppost
i
do
understand
that
why
did
they
deliberately
hang
him
there
that
would
seem
simple
the
commissioner
smiled
faintly
loyce
stiffened
his
heart
stopped
beating
bait
what
do
you
mean
to
draw
you
out
make
you
declare
yourself
so
they
know
who
was
under
control
and
who
had
escaped
loyce
recoiled
with
horror
then
they
failures
they
anticipated
he
broke
off
they
were
ready
with
a
trap
and
you
showed
yourself
you
reacted
you
made
yourself
known
the
commissioner
abruptly
moved
toward
the
door
come
along
loyce
a
lot
to
do
we
must
get
moving
there
no
time
to
waste
loyce
started
slowly
to
his
feet
numbed
and
the
man
was
the
man
i
never
saw
him
before
he
was
a
local
man
he
was
a
stranger
all
muddy
and
dirty
his
face
cut
slashed
there
was
a
strange
look
on
the
commissioner
face
as
he
answered
maybe
he
said
softly
you
understand
that
too
come
along
with
me
mr
loyce
he
held
the
door
open
his
eyes
gleaming
loyce
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
street
in
front
of
the
police
station
policemen
a
platform
of
some
sort
a
telephone
pole
and
a
rope
right
this
way
the
commissioner
said
smiling
coldly
as
the
sun
set
the
of
the
oak
grove
merchants
bank
came
up
out
of
the
vault
threw
the
heavy
time
locks
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
hurried
outside
onto
the
sidewalk
only
a
few
people
were
there
hurrying
home
to
dinner
good
night
the
guard
said
locking
the
door
after
him
good
night
clarence
mason
murmured
he
started
along
the
street
toward
his
car
he
was
tired
he
had
been
working
all
day
down
in
the
vault
examining
the
of
the
safety
deposit
boxes
to
see
if
there
was
room
for
another
tier
he
was
glad
to
be
finished
at
the
corner
he
halted
the
street
lights
had
not
yet
come
on
the
street
was
dim
everything
was
vague
he
looked
around
and
froze
from
the
telephone
pole
in
front
of
the
police
station
something
large
and
shapeless
hung
it
moved
a
little
with
the
wind
what
the
hell
was
it
mason
approached
it
warily
he
wanted
to
get
home
he
was
tired
and
hungry
he
thought
of
his
wife
his
kids
a
hot
meal
on
the
dinner
table
but
there
was
something
about
the
dark
bundle
something
ominous
and
ugly
the
light
was
bad
he
could
tell
what
it
was
yet
it
drew
him
on
made
him
move
closer
for
a
better
look
the
shapeless
thing
made
him
uneasy
he
was
frightened
by
it
frightened
and
fascinated
and
the
strange
part
was
that
nobody
else
seemed
to
notice
it
