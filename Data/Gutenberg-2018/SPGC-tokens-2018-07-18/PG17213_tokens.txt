preface
these
essays
written
for
the
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
were
intended
as
first
sketches
only
of
a
maturer
work
which
the
author
hoped
before
giving
finally
to
the
public
to
complete
at
leisure
and
develop
in
a
form
worthy
of
critical
acceptance
and
of
the
great
subject
he
had
chosen
events
however
have
marched
faster
than
he
at
all
anticipated
and
it
has
become
a
matter
of
importance
with
him
that
the
idea
they
were
designed
to
illustrate
should
be
given
immediate
and
full
publicity
the
french
by
their
invasion
of
tunis
have
precipitated
the
mohammedan
movement
in
north
africa
egypt
has
roused
herself
for
a
great
effort
of
national
and
religious
reform
and
on
all
sides
islam
is
seen
to
be
convulsed
by
political
portents
of
intensity
he
believes
that
his
countrymen
will
in
a
very
few
months
have
to
make
their
final
choice
in
india
whether
they
will
lead
or
be
led
by
the
wave
of
religious
energy
which
is
sweeping
eastwards
and
he
conceives
it
of
consequence
that
at
least
they
should
know
the
main
issues
of
the
problem
before
them
to
shut
their
eyes
to
the
great
facts
of
contemporary
history
because
that
history
has
no
immediate
connection
with
their
daily
life
is
a
course
unworthy
of
a
great
nation
and
in
england
where
the
opinion
of
the
people
guides
the
conduct
of
affairs
can
hardly
fail
to
bring
disaster
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
modern
british
empire
an
agglomeration
of
races
ruled
by
public
opinion
in
a
remote
island
is
an
experiment
new
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
needs
justification
in
exceptional
enlightenment
and
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
no
empire
ever
yet
was
governed
without
a
living
policy
the
author
therefore
has
resolved
to
publish
his
work
crude
as
it
is
without
more
delay
in
the
hope
that
it
may
be
instrumental
in
guiding
the
national
choice
he
is
nevertheless
fully
aware
of
its
defects
both
in
accuracy
and
completeness
and
he
can
only
hope
that
they
may
be
pardoned
him
in
view
of
the
general
truth
of
the
picture
he
has
drawn
since
the
last
of
these
essays
was
written
their
author
has
returned
to
egypt
and
has
there
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
the
ideas
vaguely
foreshadowed
by
him
as
the
dream
of
some
few
liberal
ulema
of
the
azhar
already
a
practical
reality
cairo
has
now
declared
itself
as
the
home
of
progressive
thought
in
islam
and
its
university
as
the
once
more
independent
seat
of
arabian
theology
secured
from
turkish
interference
by
the
national
movement
of
the
arabs
the
ulema
of
the
azhar
have
joined
heart
and
soul
with
the
party
of
reform
the
importance
of
this
event
can
hardly
be
overrated
and
if
as
now
seems
probable
a
liberal
mohammedan
government
by
a
free
mohammedan
people
should
establish
itself
firmly
on
the
nile
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
basis
of
a
social
and
political
reformation
for
all
islam
has
been
laid
it
is
more
than
all
a
hopeful
sign
that
extreme
moderation
with
regard
to
the
caliphate
is
observed
by
the
egyptian
leaders
independence
not
opposition
is
the
motto
of
the
party
and
no
rent
has
been
made
or
is
contemplated
by
them
in
the
orthodox
coat
of
islam
abd
el
hamid
khan
is
still
recognized
as
the
actual
emir
el
mumenin
and
the
restoration
of
a
more
legitimate
caliphate
is
deferred
for
the
day
when
its
fate
shall
have
overtaken
the
ottoman
empire
this
is
as
it
should
be
schism
would
only
weaken
the
cause
of
religion
already
threatened
by
a
thousand
enemies
and
the
premature
appearance
of
an
in
egypt
or
arabia
however
legitimate
a
candidate
he
might
be
by
birth
for
the
office
would
divide
the
mohammedan
world
into
two
hostile
camps
and
so
bring
scandal
and
injury
on
the
general
cause
in
the
meantime
however
liberal
thought
will
have
a
fair
field
for
its
development
and
can
hardly
fail
to
extend
its
influence
wherever
the
arabic
language
is
spoken
and
among
all
those
races
which
look
on
the
azhar
as
the
centre
of
their
intellectual
life
this
is
a
notable
achievement
and
one
which
patience
may
turn
perhaps
in
a
very
few
years
to
a
more
general
triumph
there
can
be
little
doubt
now
that
the
death
of
abd
el
hamid
or
his
fall
from
empire
will
be
the
signal
for
the
return
of
the
caliphate
to
cairo
and
a
formal
renewal
there
by
the
arabian
mind
of
its
lost
religious
leadership
to
mohammedans
the
author
owes
more
than
a
word
of
apology
a
stranger
and
a
sojourner
among
them
he
has
ventured
on
an
exposition
of
their
domestic
griefs
and
has
occasionally
touched
the
ark
of
their
religion
with
what
will
seem
to
them
a
profane
hand
but
his
motive
has
been
throughout
a
pure
one
and
he
trusts
that
they
will
pardon
him
in
virtue
of
the
sympathy
with
them
which
must
be
apparent
in
every
line
that
he
has
written
he
has
predicted
for
them
great
political
misfortunes
in
the
immediate
future
because
he
believes
that
these
are
a
necessary
step
in
the
process
of
their
spiritual
development
but
he
has
a
supreme
confidence
in
islam
not
only
as
a
spiritual
but
as
a
temporal
system
the
heritage
and
gift
of
the
arabian
race
and
capable
of
satisfying
their
most
civilized
wants
and
he
believes
in
the
hour
of
their
political
resurgence
in
the
meantime
he
is
convinced
that
he
serves
their
interests
best
by
speaking
what
he
holds
to
be
the
truth
regarding
their
situation
their
day
of
empire
has
all
but
passed
away
but
there
remains
to
them
a
day
of
social
independence
better
than
empire
enlightened
reformed
and
united
in
sympathy
mussulmans
need
not
fear
political
destruction
in
their
original
homes
arabia
egypt
and
north
africa
and
these
must
suffice
them
as
a
dar
el
islam
till
better
days
shall
come
if
the
author
can
do
anything
to
help
them
to
preserve
that
independence
they
may
count
upon
him
freely
within
the
limits
of
his
strength
and
he
trusts
to
prove
to
them
yet
his
sincerity
in
some
worthier
way

in

is

in

it
may
not
perhaps
be
impossible
to
direct
public
attention
to
the
rapid
growth
of
questions
which
for
the
last
few
years
have
been
agitating
the
religious
mind
of
asia
and
which
are
certain
before
long
to
present
themselves
as
a
very
serious
perplexity
to
british
statesmen
questions
moreover
which
if
not
dealt
with
by
them
betimes
it
will
later
be
found
out
of
their
power
to
deal
with
at
all
though
a
vigorous
policy
at
the
present
moment
might
yet
solve
them
to
this
country
very
great
advantage
the
revival
which
is
taking
place
in
the
mohammedan
world
is
indeed
worthy
of
every
englishman
attention
and
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
it
has
not
received
anxious
consideration
at
the
hands
of
those
whose
official
responsibility
lies
chiefly
in
the
direction
of
asia
but
i
am
not
aware
that
it
has
hitherto
been
placed
in
its
true
light
before
the
english
public
or
that
a
quite
definite
policy
regarding
it
may
be
counted
on
as
existing
in
the
counsels
of
the
present
cabinet
indeed
as
regards
the
cabinet
the
reverse
may
very
well
be
the
case
we
know
how
suspicious
english
politicians
are
of
policies
which
may
be
denounced
by
their
enemies
as
speculative
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
very
magnitude
of
the
problem
to
be
solved
in
considering
the
future
of
islam
may
have
caused
it
to
be
put
aside
there
as
one
outside
the
sphere
of
practical
politics
the
phrase
is
a
convenient
one
and
is
much
used
by
those
in
power
amongst
us
who
would
evade
the
labour
or
the
responsibility
of
great
decisions
yet
that
such
a
problem
exists
in
a
new
and
very
serious
form
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
nor
will
my
proposition
as
i
think
be
doubted
by
any
who
have
mingled
much
in
the
last
few
years
with
the
mussulman
populations
of
western
asia
there
it
is
easily
discernible
that
great
changes
are
impending
changes
perhaps
analogous
to
those
which
christendom
underwent
four
hundred
years
ago
and
that
a
new
departure
is
urgently
demanded
of
england
if
she
would
maintain
even
for
a
few
years
her
position
as
the
guide
and
arbiter
of
asiatic
progress
it
was
not
altogether
without
the
design
of
gaining
more
accurate
knowledge
than
i
could
find
elsewhere
on
the
subject
of
this
mohammedan
revival
that
i
visited
jeddah
in
the
early
part
of
the
past
winter
and
that
i
subsequently
spent
some
months
in
egypt
and
syria
in
the
almost
exclusive
society
of
mussulmans
jeddah
i
argued
the
seaport
of
mecca
and
only
forty
miles
distant
from
that
famous
centre
of
the
moslem
universe
would
be
the
most
convenient
spot
from
which
i
could
obtain
such
a
view
of
islam
as
i
was
in
search
of
and
i
imagined
rightly
that
i
should
there
find
myself
in
an
atmosphere
less
provincial
than
that
of
cairo
or
bagdad
or
constantinople
jeddah
is
indeed
in
the
pilgrim
season
the
suburb
of
a
great
metropolis
and
even
a
european
stranger
there
feels
that
he
is
no
longer
in
a
world
of
little
thoughts
and
local
aspirations
on
every
side
the
politics
he
hears
discussed
are
those
of
the
great
world
and
the
religion
professed
is
that
of
a
wider
islam
than
he
has
been
accustomed
to
in
turkey
or
in
india
there
every
race
and
language
are
represented
and
every
sect
indians
persians
moors
are
there
negroes
from
the
niger
malays
from
java
tartars
from
the
khanates
arabs
from
the
french
sahara
from
oman
and
zanzibar
even
in
chinese
dress
and
undistinguishable
from
other
natives
of
the
celestial
empire
mussulmans
from
the
interior
of
china
as
one
meets
these
walking
in
the
streets
one
view
of
islam
becomes
suddenly
enlarged
and
one
finds
oneself
exclaiming
with
sir
thomas
browne
truly
the
mussulman
world
is
greater
than
that
part
of
it
geographers
have
described
the
permanent
population
too
of
jeddah
is
a
microcosm
of
islam
it
is
made
up
of
individuals
from
every
nation
under
heaven
besides
the
indigenous
arab
who
has
given
his
language
and
his
tone
of
thought
to
the
rest
there
is
a
mixed
resident
multitude
descended
from
the
countless
pilgrims
who
have
remained
to
live
and
die
in
the
holy
cities
these
preserve
to
a
certain
extent
their
individuality
at
least
for
a
generation
or
two
and
maintain
a
connection
with
the
lands
to
which
they
owe
their
origin
and
the
people
who
were
their
countrymen
thus
there
is
constantly
found
at
jeddah
a
free
mart
of
intelligence
for
all
that
is
happening
in
the
world
and
the
common
gossip
of
the
bazaar
retails
news
from
every
corner
of
the
mussulman
earth
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
one
can
learn
more
of
modern
islam
in
a
week
at
jeddah
than
in
a
year
elsewhere
for
there
the
very
shopkeepers
discourse
of
things
divine
and
even
the
frank
prophesy
the
hejazi
is
less
shy
too
of
discussing
religious
matters
than
his
fellow
mussulmans
are
in
other
places
religion
is
as
it
were
part
of
his
and
he
is
accustomed
to
parade
it
before
strangers
with
a
european
he
may
do
this
a
little
disdainfully
but
still
he
will
do
it
and
with
less
disguise
or
desire
to
please
than
is
in
most
places
the
case
moreover
and
this
is
important
it
is
almost
always
the
practical
side
of
questions
that
the
commercial
jeddan
will
put
forward
he
sees
things
from
a
political
and
economical
point
of
view
rather
than
a
doctrinal
and
if
fanatical
he
is
so
from
the
same
motives
and
no
others
which
once
moved
the
citizens
of
ephesus
to
defend
the
worship
of
their
shrines
in
other
cities
cairo
and
constantinople
excepted
the
ulema
or
learned
men
of
whom
a
stranger
might
seek
instruction
would
be
found
busying
themselves
mainly
with
doctrinal
matters
not
always
interesting
at
the
present
day
arguments
of
koranic
interpretation
which
have
from
time
immemorial
occupied
the
schools
but
here
even
these
are
treated
practically
and
as
they
bear
on
the
political
aspect
of
the
hour
for
myself
i
became
speedily
impressed
with
the
advantage
thus
afforded
me
and
neglected
no
opportunity
which
offered
itself
for
listening
and
asking
questions
so
that
without
pretending
to
the
possession
of
more
special
skill
than
any
intelligent
inquirer
might
command
i
obtained
a
mass
of
information
i
can
not
but
think
to
be
of
great
value
while
this
in
its
turn
served
me
later
as
an
introduction
to
such
mussulman
divines
as
i
afterwards
met
in
the
north
jeddah
then
realized
all
my
hopes
and
gratified
nearly
all
my
curiosities
i
will
own
too
to
having
come
away
with
more
than
a
gratified
curiosity
and
to
having
found
new
worlds
of
thought
and
life
in
an
atmosphere
i
had
fancied
to
be
only
of
decay
i
was
astonished
at
the
vigorous
life
of
islam
at
its
practical
hopes
and
fears
in
this
modern
nineteenth
century
and
above
all
at
its
reality
as
a
moral
force
so
that
if
i
had
not
exactly
come
to
scoff
i
certainly
remained
in
a
certain
sense
to
pray
at
least
i
left
it
interested
as
i
had
never
thought
to
be
in
the
great
struggle
which
seemed
to
me
impending
between
the
parties
of
reaction
in
islam
and
reform
and
not
a
little
hopeful
as
to
its
favourable
issue
what
this
is
likely
to
be
i
now
intend
to
discuss
first
however
it
will
i
think
be
as
well
to
survey
briefly
the
actual
composition
of
the
mohammedan
world
it
is
only
by
a
knowledge
of
the
elements
of
which
islam
is
made
up
that
we
can
guess
its
future
and
these
are
less
generally
known
than
they
should
be
a
stranger
from
europe
visiting
the
hejaz
is
as
i
have
said
irresistibly
struck
with
the
vastness
of
the
religious
world
in
whose
centre
he
stands
mohammedanism
to
our
western
eyes
seems
almost
bounded
by
the
limits
of
the
ottoman
empire
the
turk
stands
in
our
foreground
and
has
stood
there
from
the
days
of
bajazet
and
in
our
vulgar
tongue
his
name
is
still
synonymous
with
moslem
so
that
we
are
apt
to
look
upon
him
as
if
not
the
only
at
least
the
chief
figure
of
islam
but
from
arabia
we
see
things
in
a
truer
perspective
and
become
aware
that
beyond
and
without
the
ottoman
dominions
there
are
races
and
nations
no
less
truly
followers
of
the
prophet
beside
whom
the
turk
shrinks
into
numerical
insignificance
we
catch
sight
it
may
be
for
the
first
time
in
their
real
proportions
of
the
old
persian
and
mogul
monarchies
of
the
forty
million
mussulmans
of
india
of
the
thirty
million
malays
of
the
fifteen
million
chinese
and
the
vast
and
yet
uncounted
mohammedan
populations
of
central
africa
we
see
too
how
important
is
still
the
arabian
element
and
how
necessary
it
is
to
count
with
it
in
any
estimate
we
may
form
of
islam
possible
future
turkey
meanwhile
and
constantinople
retire
to
a
rather
remote
horizon
and
the
mussulman
centre
of
gravity

it
were
shifted
from
the
north
and

towards

and

i
was
at
some
pains
while
at
jeddah
to
gain
accurate
statistics
of
the
haj
according
to
the
various
races
and
sects
composing
it
and
with
them
of
the
populations
they
in
some
measure
represent
the
pilgrimage
is
of
course
no
certain
guide
as
to
the
composition
of
the
mussulman
world
for
many
accidents
of
distance
and
political
circumstance
interfere
with
calculations
based
on
it
still
to
a
certain
extent
a
proportion
is
preserved
between
it
and
the
populations
which
supply
it
and
in
default
of
better
statistics
of
the
haj
afford
us
an
index
not
without
value
of
the
degree
of
religious
vitality
existing
in
the
various
mussulman
countries
my
figures
which
for
convenience
i
have
arranged
in
tabular
form
are
taken
principally
from
an
official
record
kept
for
some
years
past
at
jeddah
of
the
pilgrims
landed
at
that
port
and
checked
as
far
as
european
subjects
are
concerned
by
reference
to
the
consular
agents
residing
there
they
may
therefore
be
relied
upon
as
fairly
accurate
while
for
the
land
pilgrimage
i
trust
in
part
my
own
observations
made
three
years
ago
in
part
statistics
obtained
at
cairo
and
damascus
for
the
table
of
population
in
the
various
lands
of
islam
i
am
obliged
to
go
more
directly
to
european
sources
of
information
as
may
be
supposed
no
statistics
on
this
point
of
any
value
were
obtainable
at
jeddah
but
by
taking
the
figures
commonly
given
in
our
handbooks
and
supplementing
and
correcting
these
by
reference
to
such
persons
as
i
could
find
who
knew
the
countries
i
have
i
hope
arrived
at
an
approximation
to
the
truth
near
enough
to
give
a
tolerable
idea
to
general
readers
of
the
numerical
proportions
of
islam
strict
accuracy
however
i
do
not
here
pretend
to
nor
would
it
if
obtainable
materially
help
my
present
argument
the

is

the

thus
roundly

require
explanation
in
order
to
be
of
their
full
value
as
a
view
of
islam
i
will
take
them
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
order
in
which
they
stand
grouping
them
however
for
further
convenience
sake
under
their
various
sectarian
heads
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
islam
which
in
its
institution
was
intended
to
be
one
community
political
and
religious
is
now
divided
not
only
into
many
nations
but
into
many
sects
all
however
hold
certain
fundamental
beliefs
and
all
perform
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
where
they
meet
on
common
ground
and
it
is
to
this
latter
fact
that
the
importance
attached
to
the
haj
is
mainly
owing
the
main
beliefs
common
to
all
mussulmans
are
a
belief
in
one
true
god
the
creator
and
ordainer
of
all
things
a
belief
in
a
future
life
of
reward
or
punishment
a
belief
in
a
divine
revelation
imparted
first
to
adam
and
renewed
at
intervals
to
noah
to
abraham
to
moses
and
to
jesus
christ
and
last
of
all
in
its
perfect
form
to
mohammed
this
revelation
is
not
only
one
of
dogma
but
of
practice
it
claims
to
have
taught
an
universal
rule
of
life
for
all
mankind
in
politics
and
legislation
as
well
as
in
doctrine
and
in
morals
this
is
called
islam
a
belief
in
the
koran
as
the
literal
word
of
god
and
of
its
inspired
interpretation
by
the
prophet
and
his
companions
preserved
through
tradition
hadith
these
summed
up
in
the
kelemat
or
act
of
faith
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
the
apostle
of
god
form
a
common
doctrinal
basis
for
every
sect
of
islam
and
also
common
to
all
are
the
four
religious
acts
prayer
fasting
almsgiving
and
pilgrimage
ordained
by
the
koran
itself
on
other
points
however
both
of
belief
and
practice
they
differ
widely
so
widely
that
the
sects
must
be
considered
as
not
only
distinct
from
but
hostile
to
each
other
they
are
nevertheless
it
must
be
admitted
less
absolutely
irreconcileable
than
are
the
corresponding
sects
of
christianity
for
all
allow
the
rest
to
be
distinctly
within
the
pale
of
islam
and
they
pray
on
occasion
in
each
other
mosques
and
kneel
at
the
same
shrines
on
pilgrimage
neither
do
they
condemn
each
other
errors
as
altogether
damnable
except
i
believe
in
the
case
of
the
wahhabites
who
accuse
other
moslems
of
polytheism
and
idolatry
the
census
of
the
four
great
sects
may
be
thus
roughly
given
the
sunites
or
orthodox
mohammedans
the
shiites
or
sect
of
ali
the
abadites
abadhiyeh
the
wahhabites
the
or
people
of
the
path
are
of
course
by
far
the
most
important
of
these
they
stand
in
that
relation
to
the
other
sects
in
which
the
catholic
church
stands
to
the
various
christian
heresies
and
claim
alone
to
represent
that
continuous
body
of
tradition
political
and
religious
which
is
the
sign
of
a
living
church
in
addition
to
the
dogmas
already
mentioned
they
hold
that
after
the
prophet
and
his
companions
other
authorised
channels
of
tradition
exist
of
hardly
less
authority
with
these
the
sayings
of
the
four
first
caliphs
as
collected
in
the
first
century
of
the
mohammedan
era
they
hold
to
be
inspired
and
unimpeachable
as
are
to
a
certain
extent
the
theological
treatises
of
the
four
great
doctors
of
islam
the
imams
abu
hanifeh
malek
esh
shafy
and
hanbal
and
after
them
though
with
less
and
less
authority
the
fetwas
or
decisions
of
distinguished
ulema
down
to
the
present
day
the
collected
body
of
teaching
acquired
from
these
sources
is
called
the
sheriat
in
turkey
the
sheriati
sherifeh
and
is
the
canon
law
of
islam
nor
is
it
lawful
that
this
should
be
gainsaid
while
the
imams
themselves
may
not
inaptly
be
compared
to
the
fathers
of
our
christian
church
it
is
a
dogma
too
with
the
sunites
that
they
are
not
only
an
ecclesiastical
but
a
political
body
and
that
among
them
is
the
living
representative
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
prophet
in
the
person
of
his
khalifeh
or
successor
though
there
is
much
division
of
opinion
as
to
the
precise
line
of
succession
in
the
past
and
the
legitimate
ownership
of
the
title
in
the
present
but
this
is
too
intricate
and
important
a
matter
to
be
entered
on
at
present
the
sunites
are
then
the
body
of
authority
and
tradition
and
being
more
numerous
than
the
other
three
sects
put
together
in
a
proportion
of
four
and
a
half
to
one
have
a
good
right
to
treat
these
as
heretics
it
must
not
however
be
supposed
that
even
the
sunites
profess
absolutely
homogeneous
opinions
the
path
of
orthodox
islam
is
no
macadamised
road
such
as
the
catholic
church
of
christendom
has
become
but
like
one
of
its
own
haj
routes
goes
winding
on
a
labyrinth
of
separate
tracks
some
near
some
far
apart
some
clean
out
of
sight
of
the
rest
all
lead
it
is
true
in
the
same
main
direction
and
here
and
there
in
difficult
ground
where
there
is
a
mountain
range
to
cross
or
where
some
defile
narrows
they
are
brought
together
but
otherwise
they
follow
their
own
ways
as
the
idiosyncrasy
of
race
and
disposition
may
dictate
there
is
no
common
authority
in
the
world
acknowledged
as
superior
to
the
rest
neither
is
there
any
office
corresponding
even
remotely
with
the
infallible
papacy
the
mohammedan
nations
have
for
the
most
part
each
its
separate
school
composed
of
its
own
ulema
and
presided
over
by
its
own
grand
mufti
or
sheykh
el
islam
and
these
are
independent
of
all
external
influence
if
they
meet
at
all
it
is
at
mecca
but
even
at
mecca
there
is
no
college
of
cardinals
no
central
authority
and
though
occasionally
cases
are
referred
thither
or
to
constantinople
or
cairo
the
fetwas
given
are
not
of
absolute
binding
power
over
the
faithful
in
other
lands
moreover
besides
these
national
distinctions
there
are
three
recognized
schools
of
theology
which
divide
between
them
the
allegiance
of
the
orthodox
and
which
while
not
in
theory
opposed
do
in
fact
represent
as
many
distinct
lines
of
religious
thought
these
it
has
been
the
fashion
with
european
writers
to
describe
as
sects
but
the
name
sect
is
certainly
inaccurate
for
the
distinctions
recognisable
in
their
respective
teachings
are
not
more
clearly
marked
than
in
those
of
our
own
church
parties
the
high
the
low
and
the
broad
indeed
a
rather
striking
analogy
may
be
traced
between
these
three
phases
of
english
church
teaching
and
the
three
orthodox
sects
of
islam
the
three
mohammedan
schools
are
the
hanefite
the
malekite
and
the
shafite
while
a
fourth
the
hanbalite
is
usually
added
but
it
numbers
at
the
present
day
so
few
followers
that
we
need
not
notice
it
a
few
words
will
describe
each
of
these
the
school
of
theology
may
be
described
as
the
school
of
the
upper
classes
it
is
the
high
and
dry
party
of
church
and
state
if
such
expressions
can
be
used
about
islam
to
it
belongs
the
osmanli
race
i
believe
without
exception
the
ruling
race
of
the
north
and
their
kinsmen
who
founded
empires
in
central
and
southern
asia
the
official
classes
too
in
most
parts
of
the
world
are
hanefite
including
the
viceregal
courts
of
egypt
tripoli
and
tunis
and
it
would
seem
the
courts
of
most
of
the
indian
princes
it
is
probably
rather
as
a
consequence
of
this
than
as
its
reason
that
it
is
the
most
conservative
of
schools
conservative
in
the
true
sense
of
leaving
things
exactly
as
they
are
the
turkish
ulema
have
always
insisted
strongly
on
the
dogma
that
the
that
is
to
say
the
elaboration
of
new
doctrine
is
absolutely
closed
that
nothing
can
be
added
to
or
taken
away
from
the
already
existing
body
of
religious
law
and
that
no
new
or
doctor
of
islam
can
be
expected
who
shall
adapt
that
law
to
the
life
of
the
modern
world
at
the
same
time
while
obstinate
in
matters
of
opinion
hanefism
has
become
extremely
lax
as
to
practice
its
moral
teaching
is
held
and
i
believe
justly
to
be
adapted
only
too
closely
to
the
taste
of
its
chief
supporters
it
is
accused
by
its
enemies
of
having
given
the
sanction
of
its
toleration
to
the
moral
disorders
common
among
the
turks
their
use
of
fermented
drinks
their
immoderate
concubinage
and
other
worse
vices
it
is
in
fact
the
official
school
of
ottoman
orthodoxy
it
embraces
most
of
those
who
at
the
present
day
support
the
revived
spiritual
pretensions
of
constantinople
the
pilgrimage
then
described
in
our
table
as
ottoman
is
mostly
made
up
of
men
of
this
theological
school
it
must
not
however
be
supposed
that
anything
like
the
whole
number
either
of
the
pilgrims
or
of
the
population
they
represent
is
composed
of
turks
the
true
ottoman
turk
is
probably
now
among
the
rarest
of
visitors
to
mecca
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
whole
turkish
census
in
europe
and
in
asia
amounts
to
more
than
four
millions
with
regard
to
the
pilgrimage
there
is
good
reason
why
this
should
be
the
case
in
turkey
all
the
young
men
who
are
the
first
material
of
the
haj
are
taken
from
other
duties
for
military
service
and
hardly
any
now
make
their
tour
of
the
kaaba
except
in
the
sultan
uniform
rich
merchants
the
second
material
of
the
haj
in
other
lands
are
almost
unknown
among
the
turks
and
the
officials
the
only
class
in
the
empire
have
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
absent
themselves
from
their
worldly
business
of
intrigue
besides
the
official
turk
is
already
too
civilized
to
put
up
readily
with
the
real
hardships
of
the
haj
in
spite
of
the
alleviations
effected
by
the
steam
navigation
of
the
red
sea
pilgrimage
is
still
no
small
matter
and
once
landed
at
jeddah
all
things
are
much
as
they
were
a
hundred
years
ago
while
the
turk
has
changed
with
his
modern
notion
of
dress
and
comfort
he
may
indeed
be
excused
for
shrinking
from
the
quaint
nakedness
of
the
pilgrim
garb
and
the
march
to
arafat
under
a
tropical
sun
besides
there
is
the
land
journey
still
of
three
hundred
miles
to
make
before
he
can
reach
medina
and
what
to
some
would
be
worse
hardship
a
wearisome
waiting
afterwards
in
the
unhealthy
ports
of
hejaz
the
turkish
official
too
has
learned
to
dispense
with
so
many
of
the
forms
of
his
religion
that
he
finds
no
difficulty
in
making
himself
excuses
here
in
fact
he
seldom
or
never
now
performs
the
pilgrimage
the
mass
of
the
ottoman
haj
is
made
up
of
kurds
syrians
albanians
circassians
lazis
and
tartars
from
russia
and
the
khanates
of
everything
rather
than
real
turks
nor
are
those
that
come
distinguished
greatly
for
their
piety
or
learning
the
school
of
sophia
at
constantinople
has
lost
its
old
reputation
as
a
seat
of
religious
knowledge
and
its
ulema
are
known
to
be
more
occupied
with
the
pursuit
of
court
patronage
than
with
any
other
science
so
much
indeed
is
this
the
case
that
serious
students
often
prefer
a
residence
at
bokhara
or
even
in
the
heretical
schools
of
persia
as
a
more
real
road
to
learning
turkey
proper
boasts
at
the
present
day
few
theologians
of
note
and
still
fewer
independent
thinkers
the
egyptian
haj
is
far
more
flourishing
speaking
the
language
of
arabia
the
citizen
of
cairo
is
more
at
home
in
the
holy
places
than
any
inhabitant
of
the
northern
towns
can
be
the
customs
of
hejaz
are
very
nearly
his
own
customs
and
its
climate
not
much
more
severe
than
his
cairo
too
can
boast
a
far
more
ancient
political
connection
with
mecca
than
constantinople
can
for
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
the
sultans
of
egypt
were
protectors
of
the
holy
places
while
even
since
the
ottoman
conquest
the
caliph
authority
in
arabia
has
been
almost
uninterruptedly
interpreted
by
his
representative
at
cairo
so
lately
as
this
was
the
position
of
things
at
mecca
and
it
is
only
since
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
that
direct
administration
from
constantinople
has
been
seriously
attempted
to
the
present
day
the
viceroy
of
egypt
shares
with
the
sultan
the
privilege
of
sending
a
mahmal
or
camel
litter
to
mecca
every
year
with
a
covering
for
the
kaaba
moreover
the
azhar
mosque
of
cairo
is
the
great
university
of
races
and
its
ulema
have
the
highest
reputation
of
any
in
islam
egyptian
influence
therefore
must
be
reckoned
as
an
important
element
in
the
forces
which
make
up
mohammedan
opinion
the
late
khedive
it
is
true
did
much
to
impair
this
by
his
infidelity
and
his
coquetteries
with
europe
and
under
his
reign
the
egyptian
haj
fell
to
a
low
level
but
mohammed
towfik
who
is
a
sincere
though
liberal
mussulman
has
already
restored
much
of
his
country
prestige
at
mecca
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
time
to
come
egypt
grown
materially
prosperous
may
once
more
take
a
leading
part
in
the
politics
of
islam
but
of
this
later
all
three
schools
of
theology
are
taught
in
the
azhar
mosque
and
egyptians
are
divided
according
to
their
class
between
them
the
viceroy
and
the
ruling
clique
men
of
ottoman
origin
are
hanefites
and
so
too
are
the
descendants
of
the
circassian
beys
but
the
leading
merchants
of
cairo
and
the
common
people
of
that
city
are
shafites
while
the
fellahin
of
the
delta
are
almost
entirely
malekite
malekite
too
are
the
tribes
west
of
the
nile
following
the
general
rule
of
the
population
of
africa
the
school
of
religious
thought
differs
widely
from
the
hanefite
if
the
latter
has
been
described
as
the
high
church
party
of
islam
this
must
be
described
as
the
low
it
is
puritanical
fierce
in
its
dogma
severe
in
its
morals
and
those
who
profess
it
are
undoubtedly
the
most
fervent
the
most
fanatical
of
believers
they
represent
more
nearly
than
any
other
mussulmans
the
ancient
earnestness
of
the
prophet
companions
and
the
sword
in
their
hand
is
ever
the
sword
of
god
piety
too
ostensible
and
sincere
is
found
everywhere
among
the
malekites
abd
el
kader
the
soldier
saint
is
their
type
and
holy
men
by
hereditary
profession
abound
among
them
the
malekites
believe
with
earnest
faith
in
things
supernatural
dreaming
prophetic
dreams
and
seeing
miracles
performed
as
occurrences
with
the
arabs
of
africa
unlike
their
kinsmen
in
arabia
itself
to
pray
and
fast
is
still
a
severe
duty
and
no
class
of
mussulmans
are
more
devout
on
pilgrimage
in
algiers
and
morocco
it
is
as
common
for
a
young
man
of
fortune
to
build
a
mosque
as
it
is
for
him
to
keep
a
large
stud
of
horses
to
do
so
poses
him
in
the
world
and
a
life
of
prayer
is
strictly
a
life
of
fashion
with
regard
to
morals
he
is
severe
where
the
koran
is
severe
indulgent
where
it
indulges
wine
with
him
is
an
abomination
and
asceticism
with
regard
to
meat
and
tobacco
is
often
practised
by
him
on
the
whole
he
is
respectable
and
respected
but
the
reforms
he
would
impose
on
islam
are
too
purely
reactive
to
be
altogether
acceptable
to
the
mass
of
mohammedans
or
suited
to
the
urgent
necessities
of
the
age
it
is
conceivable
however
that
should
the
revival
of
islam
take
the
form
of
a
religious
war
the
races
of
africa
may
be
found
taking
the
leading
part
in
it
tripoli
tunis
algiers
and
morocco
contain
hardy
races
of
fighting
men
who
may
yet
trouble
europe
and
fifty
years
of
rule
have
not
yet
assimilated
the
french
sahara
it
is
difficult
to
gain
accurate
statistics
as
to
the
proportion
of
pilgrims
sent
to
mecca
by
these
various
states
but
it
would
seem
the
algerian
pilgrimage
is
the
smallest
this
is
due
mainly
to
hindrances
raised
by
the
french
government
whose
policy
it
is
to
isolate
their
province
from
the
rest
of
the
mussulman
world
an
algerian
pilgrim
is
called
upon
to
produce
the
sum
of
francs
before
he
is
permitted
to
embark
for
jeddah
and
he
is
subjected
to
various
other
needless
formalities
still
the
number
sent
is
large
and
their
fervour
undoubted
though
the
upper
classes
from
a
fear
of
losing
credit
with
the
french
authorities
rather
hold
aloof
the
mainstay
of
the
mogrebbin
haj
are
the
moors
these
have
an
immense
name
for
zeal
and
religious
courage
at
mecca
and
for
the
great
scrupulosity
with
which
they
perform
their
religious
duties
there
is
too
among
the
moors
a
far
wider
level
of
theological
education
than
among
most
mussulmans
i
made
acquaintance
while
at
jeddah
with
a
young
arab
from
shinghiat
in
senegal
who
bedouin
as
he
was
was
an
alem
and
one
sufficiently
well
versed
in
the
sheriat
to
be
referred
to
more
than
once
in
my
presence
on
points
of
religious
law
and
literature
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
finding
a
bedouin
thus
learned
for
he
was
evidently
an
arab
of
the
arabs
but
he
told
me
his
was
no
exceptional
position
and
that
most
bedouins
in
southern
morocco
could
read
the
koran
the
moors
would
have
a
still
higher
position
in
islam
than
that
already
given
them
were
it
not
that
they
are
on
one
point
at
variance
with
the
mass
of
sunites
they
do
not
acknowledge
the
modern
caliphate
those
therefore
of
the
sunites
who
have
acknowledged
the
ottoman
claim
are
at
issue
with
the
moors
on
all
other
points
however
the
moors
are
sunites
of
the
sunites
from
the
moor
to
the
negro
is
but
a
step
though
it
is
a
step
of
race
perhaps
of
species
the
political
and
religious
connection
of
morocco
with
the
soudan
is
a
very
close
one
and
whatever
may
be
the
future
of
the
mediterranean
provinces
fronting
the
spanish
coast
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
moorish
form
of
mohammedanism
will
be
perpetuated
in
central
africa
it
is
there
indeed
that
islam
has
the
best
certainty
of
expansion
and
the
fairest
field
for
a
propagation
of
its
creed
statistics
if
they
could
be
obtained
would
i
am
convinced
show
an
immense
mohammedan
progress
within
the
last
hundred
years
among
the
negro
races
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
islam
has
so
much
to
offer
to
the
children
of
ham
that
it
can
not
fail
to
win
them
so
much
more
than
any
form
of
christianity
or
european
progress
can
give
the
christian
missionary
makes
his
way
slowly
in
africa
he
has
no
true
brotherhood
to
offer
the
negro
except
in
another
life
he
makes
no
appeal
to
a
present
sense
of
dignity
in
the
man
he
would
convert
what
christian
missionary
takes
a
negress
to
wife
or
sits
with
the
negro
wholly
as
an
equal
at
meat
their
relations
remain
at
best
those
of
teacher
with
taught
master
with
servant
grown
man
with
child
the
mohammedan
missionary
from
morocco
meanwhile
stands
on
a
different
footing
he
says
to
the
negro
come
up
and
sit
beside
me
give
me
your
daughter
and
take
mine
all
who
pronounce
the
formula
of
islam
are
equal
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
in
becoming
a
mussulman
even
a
slave
acquires
immediate
dignity
and
the
right
to
despise
all
men
whatever
their
colour
who
are
not
as
himself
this
is
a
bribe
in
the
hand
of
the
preacher
of
the
koran
and
one
which
has
never
appealed
in
vain
to
the
enslaved
races
of
the
world
central
africa
then
may
be
counted
on
as
the
inheritance
of
islam
at
no
very
distant
day
it
is
already
said
to
count
ten
millions
of
moslems
the
school
the
third
of
the
four
orthodox
sects
is
the
most
flourishing
of
all
in
point
of
numbers
and
it
has
characteristics
which
mark
it
out
as
the
one
best
adapted
to
survive
in
the
struggle
which
is
impending
between
the
schools
of
religious
thought
in
islam
the
shafites
may
be
compared
to
our
broad
church
though
without
its
immediate
tendency
to
infidelity
with
the
shafites
there
is
a
disposition
to
widen
rather
than
to
narrow
the
area
of
theology
the
hanefites
and
malekites
proclaim
loudly
that
inquiry
has
been
closed
and
change
is
impossible
but
the
shafites
are
inclined
to
seek
a
new
mujtahed
who
shall
reconcile
islam
with
the
modern
conditions
of
the
world
they
feel
that
there
is
something
wrong
in
things
as
they
are
for
islam
is
no
longer
politically
prosperous
and
they
would
see
it
united
once
more
and
reorganized
even
at
the
expense
of
some
dogmatic
concessions
i
know
that
many
even
of
the
shafites
themselves
will
deny
this
for
no
mussulman
will
willingly
acknowledge
that
he
is
an
advocate
of
change
but
it
is
unquestionable
that
among
members
of
their
school
such
ideas
are
more
frequently
found
than
with
the
others
among
the
shafites
too
ideas
of
a
moral
reformation
find
a
footing
and
they
speak
more
openly
than
the
rest
their
suspicion
that
the
house
of
othman
with
its
fornications
and
its
bestialities
and
contempt
of
justice
has
been
the
ruin
of
islam
arabian
custom
is
the
basis
of
its
ideas
upon
this
head
for
most
arabs
out
of
africa
if
anything
are
shafites
and
it
is
the
school
of
the
virtuous
poor
rather
than
of
the
licentious
rich
it
is
more
humane
in
its
bearing
towards
jews
and
christians
finding
a
common
ground
with
them
in
the
worship
of
the
one
true
god
the
moral
law
propounded
at
various
times
to
man
and
the
natural
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
i
may
exaggerate
this
perhaps
but
something
of
it
certainly
exists
and
it
is
a
feeling
that
is
growing
shafism
has
its
stronghold
at
cairo
where
the
sheykh
el
islam
has
always
belonged
to
this
rite
but
it
is
also
the
prevailing
school
in
asia
wherever
mohammedanism
has
been
introduced
through
the
instrumentality
of
arabian
missionaries
in
india
the
mass
of
the
mussulman
population
is
shafite
especially
in
hyderabad
and
the
bombay
presidency
where
the
arab
element
is
strongest
while
hanefism
is
the
school
of
the
great
people
who
derive
their
origin
from
the
mogul
conquests
and
of
many
of
the
ulema
who
are
in
the
habit
of
making
their
religious
education
complete
in
the
hanefite
schools
of
bokhara
wahhabism
too
in
the
present
century
has
taken
great
hold
of
the
poorer
classes
and
within
the
last
few
years
a
turkish
propaganda
has
been
at
work
among
them
with
some
success
but
of
this
again
later
the
indian
haj
is
the
most
numerous
and
represents
the
largest
population
of
all
on
our
list
and
it
is
besides
the
most
wealthy
the
indian
mussulman
has
less
to
fear
from
the
climate
of
arabia
than
the
native
of
more
northern
lands
and
few
who
can
afford
it
fail
to
perform
this
religious
duty
at
least
once
in
their
lives
the
english
government
neither
checks
nor
encourages
the
haj
and
indeed
of
late
years
has
shown
a
rather
culpable
negligence
as
to
the
interests
of
british
subjects
on
pilgrimage
such
at
least
is
the
opinion
i
heard
constantly
given
at
jeddah
and
several
recent
incidents
seem
to
prove
that
a
little
closer
attention
to
this
matter
would
be
advisable
that
ugly
story
which
was
told
in
our
newspapers
more
than
a
year
ago
of
the
abandonment
of
a
pilgrim
ship
in
the
red
sea
by
her
british
captain
is
i
am
sorry
to
say
a
true
one
and
i
heard
it
confirmed
with
every
circumstance
which
could
aggravate
the
charges
made
the
captain
in
a
fit
of
panic
left
the
ship
without
any
substantial
excuse
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
good
conduct
of
a
young
man
his
nephew
who
though
ordered
to
leave
too
refused
out
of
humanity
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
vessel
would
have
been
lost
a
very
painful
impression
was
produced
on
the
jeddans
while
i
was
there
by
the
news
that
this
english
captain
had
been
sentenced
for
all
punishment
by
an
english
court
to
two
years
suspension
of
his
certificate
indian
pilgrims
have
besides
been
very
roughly
treated
in
hejaz
by
the
authorities
during
the
last
year
because
they
were
british
subjects
and
this
without
obtaining
any
redress
such
at
least
is
the
gossip
of
the
town
however
this
may
be
it
seems
to
me
astonishing
that
so
important
a
matter
as
the
indian
haj
should
be
left
as
it
now
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
chance
the
dutch
do
not
so
leave
the
management
of
their
pilgrimage
from
java
which
it
will
be
remarked
stands
second
only
to
india
on
my
list
in
respect
of
numbers
their
policy
is
a
very
definite
one
and
seems
justified
by
results
there
is
no
disillusion
they
argue
for
a
mussulman
greater
than
to
have
visited
mecca
and
they
say
that
a
returned
hajji
is
seldom
heard
to
complain
in
java
of
his
lot
as
the
subject
of
a
christian
power
besides
the
disappointment
which
all
pilgrims
are
wont
to
feel
who
come
with
exalted
hopes
and
find
their
holy
lands
undistinguishable
from
the
other
lands
of
the
world
the
pilgrim
to
mecca
certainly
has
to
encounter
a
series
of
dangers
and
annoyances
which
he
can
not
but
recognize
to
be
the
result
of
mussulman
misgovernment
from
the
moment
of
his
landing
on
the
holy
shore
he
finds
himself
beset
with
dangers
he
is
fleeced
by
the
turkish
officials
befooled
by
the
religious
touts
of
the
towns
and
sometimes
robbed
openly
by
actual
highway
robbers
the
religious
government
of
the
land
has
no
redress
to
offer
him
and
the
turkish
guardians
of
the
peace
who
affect
to
rule
are
only
potent
in
demanding
fees
at
every
step
he
is
waylaid
and
tricked
and
he
finds
the
hejazi
the
keepers
of
the
holy
places
and
privileged
ciceroni
of
the
shrines
shrewder
as
men
of
business
than
devout
as
believers
and
he
returns
to
his
home
a
sadder
and
the
dutch
say
a
wiser
man
i
do
not
affirm
that
the
dutch
are
right
but
this
is
the
principle
they
act
on
and
they
boast
of
its
success
we
in
india
as
i
have
said
in
our
grand
careless
way
leave
all
these
things
to
chance
india
nevertheless
still
holds
the
first
rank
in
the
haj
and
all
things
considered
is
now
the
most
important
land
where
the
mohammedan
faith
is
found
in
the
day
of
its
greatness
the
mogul
empire
was
second
to
no
state
in
islam
and
though
its
political
power
is
in
abeyance
the
religion
itself
is
by
no
means
in
decay
india
has
probably
a
closer
connection
at
the
present
moment
with
mecca
than
any
other
country
and
it
is
looked
upon
by
many
there
as
the
mussulman
land
of
the
future
indeed
it
may
safely
be
affirmed
that
the
course
of
events
in
india
will
determine
more
than
anything
else
the
destiny
of
mohammedanism
in
the
immediate
future
of
this
and
the
next
generation
the
malays
though
holding
no
very
high
position
in
the
commonwealth
of
islam
are
important
from
their
numbers
their
commercial
prosperity
and
more
than
all
to
an
european
observer
from
the
fact
that
so
many
of
them
are
dutch
subjects
holland
if
any
lesson
for
the
future
can
be
learned
in
history
must
in
a
few
years
find
her
fate
linked
with
that
of
germany
and
so
too
her
colonies
i
will
not
now
enlarge
upon
the
prospect
thus
opened
but
it
is
a
suggestive
one
and
worthy
of
all
possible
attention
for
the
moment
the
malays
stand
rather
apart
from
other
pilgrims
at
the
shrines
they
boast
no
great
school
of
theology
or
particular
religious
complexion
and
as
pilgrims
they
are
held
in
rather
low
esteem
from
their
penurious
ways
but
they
are
a
dark
element
in
the
future
which
it
is
equally
easy
to
under
as
to
over
rate
originally
converted
by
and
to
a
certain
degree
descended
from
arabs
they
are
as
far
as
i
could
learn
followers
of
the
shafite
teaching
and
inclined
to
the
broad
rather
than
the
narrow
ways
of
islam
they
number
according
to
the
dutch
consular
agent
at
jeddah
thirty
million
souls
and
are
increasing
rapidly
both
in
java
and
in
the
other
islands
of
the
malay
archipelago
another
enigma
are
the
chinese
i
saw
a
few
of
them
in
the
streets
and
made
inquiries
as
to
them
but
i
could
gain
no
certain
information
i
have
heard
them
estimated
as
high
as
twenty
millions
and
as
low
as
five
but
it
is
certain
that
they
are
very
numerous
they
established
themselves
in
china
it
is
said
about
the
second
century
of
islam
and
their
missionaries
were
men
of
arab
race
they
are
found
scattered
in
groups
all
over
china
but
principally
inland
and
have
full
enjoyment
of
their
religion
being
a
united
body
which
is
respectable
and
makes
itself
respected
so
much
so
that
the
or
people
of
the
resurrection
as
they
are
called
are
employed
in
the
highest
offices
of
the
chinese
state
it
is
plain
however
that
they
are
hardly
at
all
connected
with
the
modern
life
of
islam
for
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
years
that
any
of
them
have
performed
the
pilgrimage
and
if
i
include
them
in
my
lists
as
sunites
and
shafites
it
is
in
default
of
other
classification
they
probably
hold
to
the
mussulman
world
a
position
analogous
in
its
isolation
to
that
of
the
abyssinian
church
in
christendom
they
too
however
may
one
day
make
their
existence
felt
for
china
is
no
dead
nation
only
asleep
and
with
them
our
survey
of
orthodox
islam
ends
the
heretical
sects
remain
to
us
of
these
the
most
notable
without
contestation
is
the
shiite
or
sect
of
ali
which
traces
its
origin
to
the
very
day
of
the
prophet
death
when
abu
bekr
was
elected
caliph
to
ali
exclusion
i
will
not
here
renew
the
arguments
urged
in
this
old
dispute
more
than
to
say
that
the
dispute
still
exists
though
it
has
long
ceased
to
be
the
only
cause
of
difference
between
shiah
and
suni
beginning
merely
as
a
political
schism
the
shiite
sect
is
now
distinctly
a
heresy
and
one
which
has
wandered
far
from
the
orthodox
road
their
principal
features
of
quarrel
with
the
sunites
are
first
a
repudiation
of
the
caliphate
and
of
all
hierarchical
authority
whatsoever
secondly
the
admission
of
a
right
of
free
judgment
in
individual
doctors
on
matters
of
religion
and
thirdly
a
general
tendency
to
superstitious
beliefs
unauthorized
by
the
koran
or
by
the
written
testimony
of
the
prophet
companions
they
also
and
this
is
their
great
doctrinal
quarrel
with
the
unitarian
sunites
believe
in
a
series
of
incarnations
of
the
twelve
qualities
of
god
in
the
persons
of
the
twelve
imams
and
in
the
advent
of
the
last
of
them
as
a
messiah
or
móhdy
doctrines
which
are
especially
advanced
by
the
sheykhi
school
of
shiism
and
minimized
by
the
mutesharreh
or
orthodox
these
last
matters
however
are
rather
excrescences
than
necessary
parts
of
shiism
they
owe
their
prevalence
without
doubt
to
the
persian
mind
which
is
equally
prone
to
scepticism
and
credulity
and
where
shiism
has
always
had
its
stronghold
the
religious
constitution
of
the
sect
of
ali
has
been
described
to
me
by
a
member
of
it
who
knows
europe
well
as
resembling
in
its
organization
the
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
that
is
to
say
it
acknowledges
no
head
temporal
or
spiritual
and
each
congregation
represents
a
separate
unit
of
authority
in
itself
there
is
no
such
functionary
in
persia
as
sheykh
el
islam
or
grand
mufti
and
the
shah
claims
to
be
neither
imam
nor
caliph
each
shiite
doctor
who
has
taken
his
degree
at
kerbela
or
ispahan
may
deliver
his
fetwa
or
opinion
on
points
of
doctrine
and
the
only
test
of
his
authority
to
preach
or
lead
the
prayer
in
mosque
is
his
power
of
attracting
a
congregation
it
is
strange
that
in
a
sect
which
had
its
origin
in
an
assertion
of
hereditary
right
to
the
caliphate
everything
hereditary
should
be
now
rigidly
excluded
in
theory
i
believe
the
shias
still
hold
that
there
is
an
imam
and
caliph
but
they
will
not
tolerate
the
pretension
of
any
one
now
in
authority
to
the
title
and
leave
it
in
abeyance
until
the
advent
of
the
móhdy
or
guide
who
is
to
reunite
islam
and
restore
its
fortunes
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
sovereign
though
he
be
and
absolute
master
in
persia
the
shah
is
to
the
present
day
looked
upon
by
the
persians
as
a
usurper
and
he
himself
acknowledges
the
fact
in
a
rather
curious
ceremony
it
is
a
maxim
with
mussulmans
of
all
sects
that
prayer
is
not
valid
if
made
in
another
man
house
without
his
permission
and
this
being
so
and
the
shah
admitting
that
his
palaces
of
right
belong
not
to
himself
but
to
the
móhdy
he
is
obliged
to
lease
them
according
to
legal
form
from
an
alem
or
mujtahed
acting
for
the
supposed
móhdy
before
he
can
pray
in
them
to
his
spiritual
profit
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
with
such
an
organization
and
with
such
tendencies
to
deductive
reasoning
a
wide
basis
is
given
for
divergence
of
opinion
among
the
shiites
and
that
while
the
more
highly
educated
of
their
mollahs
occasionally
preach
absolute
pantheism
others
consult
the
grosser
inclinations
of
the
vulgar
and
indulge
their
hearers
with
the
most
extravagant
tales
of
miracle
and
superstition
these
are
a
constant
source
of
mockery
to
the
sunites
among
the
more
respectable
shiite
beliefs
however
there
seems
to
be
a
general
conviction
in
persia
that
a
reform
of
islam
is
at
hand
and
that
a
new
leader
may
be
expected
at
any
moment
and
from
any
quarter
so
that
enthusiasts
are
constantly
found
simulating
the
gifts
of
inspiration
and
affecting
a
divine
mission
the
history
of
the
babites
so
well
described
by
de
gobineau
in
his
of
is
a
case
in
point
and
similar
occurrences
are
by
no
means
rare
in
persia
i
met
at
jeddah
a
highly
educated
persian
gentleman
who
informed
me
that
he
had
himself
been
witness
when
a
boy
to
a
religious
prodigy
notorious
if
i
remember
rightly
at
tabriz
on
that
occasion
one
of
these
prophets
being
condemned
to
death
by
the
supreme
government
was
bound
to
a
cross
with
two
of
his
companions
and
after
remaining
suspended
thus
for
several
hours
was
fired
at
by
the
royal
troops
it
then
happened
that
while
the
companions
were
dispatched
at
the
first
volley
the
prophet
himself
remained
unhurt
and
incredible
to
relate
the
cords
which
bound
him
were
cut
by
the
bullets
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
on
his
feet
you
christians
said
another
persian
gentleman
once
to
me
talk
of
your
christ
as
the
son
of
god
and
think
it
strange
but
with
us
the
occurrence
is
a
common
one
believe
me
we
have
of
god
in
nearly
all
our
villages
thus
with
the
shiites
extremes
meet
no
moslems
more
readily
adapt
themselves
to
the
superficial
atheisms
of
europe
than
do
the
persians
and
none
are
more
ardently
devout
as
all
who
have
witnessed
the
miracle
play
of
the
two
imams
will
be
obliged
to
admit
extremes
too
of
morality
are
seen
fierce
asceticisms
and
gross
licentiousnesses
by
no
sect
of
islam
is
the
duty
of
pilgrimage
more
religiously
observed
or
the
prayers
and
ablutions
required
by
their
rule
performed
with
a
stricter
ritual
but
the
very
pilgrims
who
go
on
foot
to
mecca
scruple
not
to
drink
wine
there
and
persian
morality
is
everywhere
a
byword
in
all
these
circumstances
there
is
much
to
fear
as
well
as
to
hope
on
the
side
of
the
shiite
sect
but
their
future
only
indirectly
involves
that
of
islam
proper
their
whole
census
does
not
probably
exceed
fifteen
millions
and
it
shows
no
tendency
to
increase
outside
persia
we
find
about
one
million
irâki
arabs
a
few
in
syria
and
afghanistan
and
at
most
five
millions
in
india
one
small
group
still
maintains
itself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
medina
where
it
is
tolerated
rather
than
acknowledged
and
a
few
shiites
are
to
be
found
in
most
of
the
large
cities
of
the
west
but
everywhere
the
sect
of
ali
stands
apart
from
and
almost
in
a
hostile
attitude
to
the
rest
of
islam
it
is
noticeable
however
that
within
the
last
fifty
years
the
religious
bitterness
of
shiite
and
sunite
is
sensibly
in
decline
the
next
most
important
of
the
heretical
sects
is
the
abadiyeh
these
according
to
some
are
the
religious
descendants
of
the
khawarij
a
sect
which
separated
itself
from
the
califate
in
the
time
of
the
seyid
ali
and
after
a
severe
persecution
in
irak
took
refuge
at
last
in
oman
whatever
their
present
doctrines
they
seem
at
first
to
have
been
like
the
shiites
political
schismatics
they
maintained
that
any
mussulman
so
long
as
he
was
not
affected
with
heresy
might
be
chosen
imam
and
that
he
might
be
deposed
for
heresy
or
and
indeed
that
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
for
any
imam
at
all
they
are
at
present
only
found
in
oman
and
zanzibar
where
they
number
it
is
said
about
four
millions
till
as
late
as
the
last
century
the
imamate
was
an
elective
office
among
them
but
with
the
accession
of
the
abu
saïd
dynasty
it
became
hereditary
in
that
family
they
reject
all
communion
with
the
sunites
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover
that
they
hold
any
doctrines
especially
offensive
to
the
mass
of
moslems
their
differences
are
mainly
negative
and
consist
in
the
rejection
of
califal
history
and
authority
later
than
the
reign
of
omar
and
of
a
vast
number
of
traditions
now
incorporated
in
the
sunite
faith
allied
to
them
but
as
i
understood
separate
are
the
zeïdites
of
yemen
who
are
possibly
also
descended
from
the
khawarij
but
as
the
zeïdites
are
accustomed
to
conceal
the
fact
of
their
heresy
and
to
pass
themselves
when
on
pilgrimage
as
sunites
i
could
learn
little
about
them
they
were
till
ten
years
ago
independent
under
the
imams
of
sana
and
it
is
certain
that
they
repudiate
the
califate
in
former
times
before
the
first
conquest
of
arabia
by
the
turks
these
imams
were
all
powerful
in
hejaz
and
on
the
destruction
of
the
bagdad
califate
assumed
the
title
of
hami
el
harameyn
protector
of
the
holy
places
the
turks
however
now
occupy
sana
and
the
office
of
imam
is
in
abeyance
the
zeïdites
can
hardly
number
more
than
two
millions
and
their
only
importance
in
the
future
lies
in
the
fact
of
their
geographical
proximity
to
mecca
and
in
the
fact
that
their
sympathies
lie
on
the
side
of
liberality
in
opinion
and
reform
in
morals
neither
zeïdites
nor
abadites
have
any
adherents
out
of
their
own
countries
of
the
wahhabites
a
more
detailed
account
is
needed
as
although
their
numbers
are
small
and
their
political
importance
less
than
it
formerly
was
the
spirit
of
their
reform
movement
still
lives
and
exercises
a
potent
influence
on
modern
mohammedan
ideas
i
have
described
elsewhere
the
historical
vicissitudes
of
the
sect
in
arabia
and
the
decline
of
its
fortunes
in
nejd
but
a
brief
recapitulation
of
these
may
be
allowed
me
the
early
half
of
the
last
century
was
a
period
of
religious
stagnation
in
islam
almost
as
much
as
it
was
in
christendom
faith
morals
and
religious
practice
were
at
the
lowest
ebb
among
mussulmans
and
it
seemed
to
europeans
who
looked
on
as
though
the
faith
of
mecca
had
attained
its
dotage
and
was
giving
place
to
a
infidelity
politically
and
religiously
the
mussulman
world
was
asleep
when
suddenly
it
awoke
and
like
a
young
giant
refreshed
stood
once
more
erect
in
arabia
the
reform
preached
by
abd
el
wahhab
was
radical
he
began
by
breaking
with
the
maxim
held
by
the
mass
of
the
orthodox
that
inquiry
on
matters
of
faith
was
closed
he
constituted
himself
a
new
mujtahed
and
founded
a
new
school
neither
hanafite
malekite
nor
shafite
and
called
it
the
school
of
the
unitarians
muwaheddin
a
name
still
cherished
by
the
wahhabites
he
rejected
positively
all
traditions
but
those
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
and
he
denied
the
claims
of
any
but
the
first
four
caliphs
to
have
been
legitimately
elected
the
koran
was
to
be
the
only
written
law
and
islam
was
to
be
again
what
it
had
been
in
the
first
decade
of
its
existence
he
established
it
politically
in
nejd
on
precisely
its
old
basis
at
medina
and
sought
to
extend
it
over
the
whole
of
arabia
perhaps
of
the
world
i
believe
it
is
hardly
now
recognised
by
mohammedans
how
near
abd
el
wahhab
was
to
complete
success
before
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
chiefs
of
the
ibn
saouds
champions
of
unitarian
islam
had
established
their
authority
over
all
northern
arabia
as
far
as
the
euphrates
and
in
they
took
mecca
and
medina
in
the
meanwhile
the
wahhabite
doctrines
were
gaining
ground
still
further
afield
india
was
at
one
time
very
near
conversion
and
in
egypt
and
north
africa
and
even
in
turkey
many
secretly
subscribed
to
the
new
doctrines
two
things
however
marred
the
plan
of
general
reform
and
prevented
its
full
accomplishment
in
the
first
place
the
reform
was
too
completely
reactive
it
took
no
account
whatever
of
the
progress
of
modern
thought
and
directly
it
attempted
to
leave
arabia
it
found
itself
face
to
face
with
difficulties
which
only
political
as
well
as
religious
success
could
overcome
it
was
impossible
except
by
force
of
arms
to
arabianise
the
world
again
and
nothing
less
than
this
was
in
contemplation
its
second
mistake
and
that
was
one
that
a
little
of
the
prophet
prudence
which
always
went
hand
in
hand
with
his
zeal
might
have
avoided
was
a
too
rigid
insistance
upon
trifles
abd
el
wahhab
condemned
minarets
and
tombstones
because
neither
were
in
use
during
the
first
years
of
islam
the
minarets
therefore
were
everywhere
thrown
down
and
when
the
holy
places
of
hejaz
fell
into
the
hands
of
his
followers
the
tombs
of
saints
which
had
for
centuries
been
revered
as
objects
of
pilgrimage
were
levelled
to
the
ground
even
the
prophet
tomb
at
medina
was
laid
waste
and
the
treasures
it
contained
distributed
among
the
soldiers
of
ibn
saoud
this
roused
the
indignation
of
all
islam
and
turned
the
tide
of
the
wahhabite
fortunes
respectable
feeling
which
had
hitherto
been
on
their
side
now
declared
itself
against
them
and
they
never
after
regained
their
position
as
moral
and
social
reformers
politically
too
it
was
the
cause
of
their
ruin
the
outside
mussulman
world
looking
upon
them
as
sacrilegious
barbarians
was
afraid
to
visit
mecca
and
the
pilgrimage
declined
so
rapidly
that
the
hejazi
became
alarmed
the
source
of
their
revenue
they
found
cut
off
and
it
seemed
on
the
point
of
ceasing
altogether
then
they
appealed
to
constantinople
urging
the
sultan
to
vindicate
his
claim
to
be
protector
of
the
holy
places
what
followed
is
well
known
after
the
peace
of
paris
sultan
mahmud
commissioned
mehemet
ali
to
deliver
mecca
and
medina
from
the
wahhabite
heretics
and
this
he
in
time
effected
the
war
was
carried
into
nejd
deriyeh
their
capital
was
sacked
and
ibn
saoud
himself
taken
prisoner
and
decapitated
in
front
of
sophia
at
constantinople
the
movement
of
reform
in
islam
was
thus
put
back
for
perhaps
another
hundred
years
still
the
seed
cast
by
abd
el
wahhab
has
not
been
entirely
without
fruit
wahhabism
as
a
political
regeneration
of
the
world
has
failed
but
the
spirit
of
reform
has
remained
indeed
the
present
unquiet
attitude
of
expectation
in
islam
has
been
its
indirect
result
just
as
the
lutheran
reformation
in
europe
though
it
failed
to
convert
the
christian
church
caused
its
real
reform
so
wahhabism
has
produced
a
real
desire
for
reform
if
not
yet
reform
itself
in
mussulmans
islam
is
no
longer
asleep
and
were
another
and
a
wiser
abd
el
wahhab
to
appear
not
as
a
heretic
but
in
the
body
of
the
orthodox
sect
he
might
play
the
part
of
loyola
or
borromeo
with
success
the
present
condition
of
the
wahhabites
as
a
sect
is
one
of
decline
in
india
and
i
believe
in
other
parts
of
southern
asia
their
missionaries
still
make
converts
and
their
preachers
are
held
in
high
esteem
but
at
home
in
arabia
their
zeal
has
waxed
cold
giving
place
to
liberal
ideas
which
in
truth
are
far
more
congenial
to
the
arabian
mind
the
ibn
saoud
dynasty
no
longer
holds
the
first
position
in
nejd
and
ibn
rashid
who
has
taken
their
place
though
nominally
a
wahhabite
has
little
of
the
wahhabite
fanaticism
he
is
in
fact
a
popular
and
national
rather
than
a
religious
leader
and
though
still
designated
at
constantinople
as
a
pestilent
heretic
is
counted
as
their
ally
by
the
more
liberal
sunites
it
is
probable
that
he
would
not
withhold
his
allegiance
from
a
caliph
of
the
legitimate
house
of
koreysh
but
this
too
is
beyond
the
subject
of
the
present
chapter
with
the
wahhabites
then
our
census
of
islam
closes
it
has
given
us
as
i
hope
a
fairly
accurate
view
of
the
forces
which
make
up
the
mohammedan
world
and
though
the
enumeration
of
these
can
not
but
be
dull
work
i
do
not
think
it
will
have
been
work
done
in
vain
without
it
indeed
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
make
clear
the
problem
presented
to
us
by
modern
islam
or
guess
its
solution
more
interesting
matter
however
lies
before
us
and
in
my
next
chapter
i
propose
to
introduce
my
reader
to
that
burning
question
of
the
day
in
asia
the
caliphate
and
explain
the
position
of
the
house
of
othman
towards
the
mohammedan
world

the
following
is
a
formula
of
the
faith
that
thou
believest
in
god
the
one
god
and
none
other
with
him
and
that
thou
believest
that
mohammed
is
his
servant
and
his
apostle
that
thou
believest
in
the
holy
angels
and
the
holy
books
the
pentateuch
the
psalms
the
gospels
and
the
koran
that
thou
believest
in
the
last
day
and
in
the
providence
of
god
both
for
good
and
for
evil
the
hanbali
ritual
is
now
almost
entirely
confined
to
medina
and
kasim
in
central
arabia
this
was
written
before
the
events
of
last
september
which
have
given
a
new
impulse
to
liberalism
in
egypt
though
it
has
taken
the
direction
of
mohammedan
thought
there
out
of
the
hands
of
the
khedive
the
exact
composition
of
the
azhar
university
is
as
follows
of
the
five
hundred
and
odd
sheykhs
or
professors
two
hundred
are
shafite
two
hundred
malekite
one
hundred
hanefite
and
five
hanbalite
each
of
these
sections
has
a
supreme
sheykh
chosen
by
itself
whose
fetwa
on
questions
concerning
the
school
is
decisive
there
is
moreover
a
sheykh
el
islam
also
elected
who
decides
religious
questions
of
general
importance
and
a
grand
mufti
appointed
by
the
government
who
gives
fetwas
on
matters
of
law
the
latter
is
hanefite
the
former
at
the
present
moment
shafite
as
are
the

of
the
students
these

about
fifteen
hundred
it
is
the
secret
of
the
rapid
conversions
in
ancient
days
among
the
poor
of
the
roman
and
persian
empires
and
it
is
the
secret
of
those
now
taking
place
among
the
indians
the
mohammedan
revolts
in
yunan
and
kashgar
repressed
with
great
ferocity

in

the
modern
question
of
the
caliphate
about
the
year
of
our
era
of
the
hejra
selim
padishah
of
the
ottoman
turks
and
emperor
of
constantinople
finding
himself
the
most
powerful
prince
of
his
day
in
islam
and
wishing
still
further
to
consolidate
his
rule
conceived
the
idea
of
reviving
in
his
own
person
the
extinct
glories
of
the
caliphate
he
had
more
than
one
claim
to
be
considered
their
champion
by
orthodox
mohammedans
for
he
was
the
grandson
of
that
mahomet
ii
who
had
finally
extinguished
the
roman
empire
of
the
east
and
he
had
himself
just
ended
a
successful
campaign
against
the
heretical
shah
of
persia
head
of
the
sect
of
ali
his
only
rivals
among
sunite
princes
were
the
sultan
el
hind
or
as
we
call
him
the
great
mogul
the
sultan
el
gharb
or
emperor
of
morocco
and
the
mameluke
sultan
of
egypt
then
known
to
the
world
as
the
sultan
with
the
two
former
as
rulers
of
what
were
remote
lands
of
islam
selim
seems
to
have
troubled
himself
little
but
he
made
war
on
egypt
in
he
invaded
syria
its
outlying
province
and
in
he
entered
cairo
there
he
made
prisoner
the
reigning
mameluke
kansaw
el
ghouri
and
had
him
publicly
beheaded
or
according
to
another
account
received
his
head
from
a
soldier
who
had
killed
him
where
he
lay
on
the
ground
after
falling
for
the
sultan
was
an
old
man
from
his
horse
he
then
in
virtue
of
a
very
doubtful
cession
made
to
him
of
his
rights
by
one
motawakkel
ibn
omar
el
hakim
a
descendant
of
the
house
of
abbas
whom
he
found
living
as
titular
caliph
in
cairo
took
to
himself
the
following
style
and
title
sultan
es
salatin
wa
hakan
el
hawakin
malek
el
bahreyn
wa
hami
el
barreyn
khalifeh

titles
which
may
be
thus
interpreted
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
monarch
of
the
two
seas
the
mediterranean
and
the
red
sea
and
protector
of
the
two
lands
hejaz
and
syria
the
holy
lands
of
islam
successor
of
the
apostle
of
god
prince
of
the
faithful
and
emperor
it
is
said
that
he
first
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
his
name
mentioned
in
the
public
prayers
as
caliph
when
he
visited
the
great
mosque
of
zacharias
at
aleppo
on
his
return
northwards
in
such
in
a
few
words
is
historically
the
origin
of
the
modern
caliphate
and
such
are
the
titles
now
borne
by
selim
descendant
abd
el
hamid
it
is
difficult
at
this
distance
of
time
and
in
the
absence
of
detailed
contemporary
narratives
to
do
more
than
guess
the
effect
on
mussulmans
of
his
day
of
selim
religious
pretensions
to
all
alike
friends
as
well
as
foes
he
must
in
the
first
instance
have
appeared
as
an
usurper
for
before
him
no
man
not
of
the
house
of
koreysh
and
so
a
kinsman
of
their
prophet
had
ever
claimed
to
be
his
spiritual
heir
indeed
it
was
a
maxim
with
all
schools
of
theology
of
all
ages
that
descent
from
the
koreysh
was
the
first
title
to
the
caliphate
but
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
within
the
limits
of
his
own
dominions
and
even
to
the
mass
of
the
vulgar
beyond
them
the
ottoman
sublime
proceedings
met
with
approval
selim
was
a
portentous
figure
in
islam
and
the
splendour
of
his
apparition
in
the
north
dazzled
the
eyes
of
all
mussulmans
must
have
seen
in
him
and
his
house
the
restorers
of
their
political
fortunes
and
the
champion
of
their
religion
against
christendom
and
a
departure
from
established
rule
in
his
favour
may
well
have
seemed
justified
to
pious
persons
as
the
best
hope
for
the
future
of
their
creed
selim
was
already
temporal
lord
of
the
greater
part
of
islam
and
he
might
be
expected
thus
to
restore
the
spiritual
sovereignty
also
besides
to
the
ears
of
mussulmans
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
caliphal
title
was
no
longer
a
familiar
sound
and
the
title
of
sultan
which
selim
already
bore
was
that
of
the
highest
temporal
authority
they
knew
the
caliphate
if
it
existed
at
all
was
in
the
modern
world
a
less
imposing
name
than
the
sultanate
and
the
two
had
since
the
destruction
of
bagdad
become
confused
as
they
still
remain
in
men
minds
who
do
not
any
more
now
make
common
use
of
the
older
title
thus
it
was
not
difficult
for
the
new
sultan
of
damascus
and
cairo
and
medina
to
impose
himself
on
the
multitude
not
merely
as
heir
to
the
caliphal
possessions
but
to
the
title
also
of
the
caliphs
and
their
spiritual
rank
advantage
too
seems
to
have
been
taken
in
the
first
instance
as
it
has
been
subsequently
of
the
accidental
resemblance
of
name
between
othman
selim
ancestor
and
othman
the
third
caliph
the
vulgar
ear
caught
the
sound
as
one
familiar
to
it
and
was
satisfied
for
there
is
all
the
world
in
a
name
with
the
ulema
however
it
was
necessary
to
be
more
precise
and
we
know
that
the
question
of
the
ottoman
right
to
the
spiritual
succession
of
the
prophet
was
one
long
and
hotly
debated
in
the
schools
tradition
was
formal
on
the
point
of
excluding
aliens
to
the
koreysh
from
this
its
legal
inheritance
for
mohammed
himself
had
repeatedly
distinguished
his
own
tribe
as
being
the
sole
heirs
to
his
authority
nor
would
any
doctor
of
the
specially
arabian
schools
listen
to
a
departure
from
ideas
so
absolute
the
hanefite
school
however
representing
those
chiefly
interested
in
accepting
the
ottoman
pretension
undertook
its
legal
defence
and
succeeded
in
spite
of
the
one
great
obstacle
of
birth
in
making
out
a
very
tolerable
case
for
themselves
and
the
beni
othman
a
case
which
in
the
absence
of
any
rival
candidate
to
oppose
to
them
has
since
been
tacitly
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
sunite
ulema
the
difficulty
however
was
in
practice
settled
by
a
compromise
and
the
dispute
itself
had
long
been
forgotten
by
all
but
the
learned
until
within
the
present
generation
its
arguments
were
once
more
dragged
out
publicly
to
serve
a
political
purpose
the
hanefite
arguments
are
on
this
account
interesting
and
i
have
been
at
pains
to
ascertain
and
understand
them
but
perhaps
before
i
state
them
in
detail
it
will
be
best
first
briefly
to
run
over
the
caliphal
history
of
an
earlier
age
and
describe
the
state
of
things
which
selim
act
superseded
orthodox
mussulman
writers
recognize
four
distinct
phases
which
the
office
of
khalifeh
has
undergone
and
four
distinct
periods
of
its
history
the
word
khalifeh
derived
from
the
arabic
root
to
leave
behind
signifies
literally
one
left
behind
and
in
the
legal
sense
the
relict
or
successor
of
the
prophet
and
heir
to
his
temporal
and
spiritual
power
the
historical
phase
noticed
is
one
of
pure
theocracy
in
which
the
caliph
or
successor
of
mohammed
was
saint
as
well
as
priest
and
king
and
was
to
a
certain
extent
inspired
it
lasted
thirty
years
only
and
is
represented
by
the
four
great
caliphs
abu
bekr
omar
othman
and
ali
who
receive
from
the
faithful
when
they
speak
of
them
the
title
of
seydna
or
our
lord
the
phase
which
lasted
nearly
six
hundred
years
is
that
of
the
arabian
monarchy
in
which
the
caliphate
took
the
shape
of
hereditary
temporal
dominion
its
representatives
are
neither
saints
nor
doctors
of
the
law
and
stand
on
a
quite
different
footing
from
those
who
precede
them
they
begin
with
mawiyeh
ibn
ommiyah
founder
of
the
ommiad
dynasty
and
end
with
mostasem
billah
the
last
sultan
of
the
abbasides
the
period
is
a
phase
of
temporal
during
which
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
the
khalifeh
exercised
no
sovereign
rights
and
resided
as
a
spiritual
chief
only
or
as
we
should
now
say
sheykh
el
islam
at
cairo
the
temporal
authority
of
islam
which
is
theoretically
supposed
to
have
been
continued
without
break
even
during
this
period
was
then
in
delegation
with
the
memluk
sultans
of
egypt
and
other
mussulman
princes
the
phase
is
that
of
the
ottoman
caliphate
as
nearly
all
modern
arguments
respecting
the
caliphate
appeal
to
examples
in
the
earliest
period
it
will
be
well
to
consider
the
origin
of
its
institution
and
the
political
basis
of
islam
itself
mohammedan
doctors
affirm
that
the
apostle
of
god
mohammed
on
whose
name
be
peace
when
he
fled
from
mecca
did
so
not
as
a
rebellious
citizen
but
as
a
pretender
to
authority
he
was
by
birth
a
prince
of
the
princely
house
of
the
koreysh
itself
the
noblest
tribe
of
hejaz
and
his
grandfather
had
been
supreme
ruler
in
mecca
he
established
himself
therefore
with
his
companions
in
exile
as
head
of
an
independent
political
community
following
in
this
the
ancient
custom
of
arabia
where
sections
constantly
cut
themselves
off
from
the
parent
tribe
and
form
new
nations
under
the
separate
leadership
of
one
or
another
member
of
their
princely
families
islam
therefore
was
from
its
commencement
a
political
as
well
as
a
religious
body
and
while
mohammed
preached
to
his
disciples
as
a
prophet
he
also
gave
laws
to
them
as
their
king
and
governor
he
was
their
imam
the
leader
of
their
prayer
and
he
was
their
emir
and
kadi
prince
and
magistrate
thus
the
supreme
temporal
and
spiritual
authority
became
linked
and
islam
was
from
its
beginning
a
nation
no
less
than
a
church
as
long
as
mohammed
lived
this
state
of
things
remained
unquestioned
and
difficulties
began
only
at
his
death
it
is
a
point
which
has
been
much
disputed
what
were
the
prophet
intentions
regarding
this
event
in
early
times
the
sect
of
ali
maintained
that
he
had
appointed
his
his
heir
and
others
have
held
that
abu
bekr
had
the
nomination
but
sunites
are
now
mostly
agreed
that
no
individual
appointment
was
made
and
that
the
choice
of
a
successor
was
left
to
be
decided
by
election
in
any
case
the
procedure
followed
by
bereaved
followers
was
elective
and
its
details
were
in
strict
accordance
with
that
arabian
custom
on
which
the
koranic
law
is
mainly
built
now
in
an
arab
tribe
when
the
sheykh
dies
the
elders
of
the
tribe
heads
of
its
great
houses
and
sections
assemble
in
one
of
their
number
tent
and
sitting
in
a
circle
discuss
the
subject
of
his
succession
theoretically
the
choice
of
a
successor
is
open
to
any
one
of
them
for
the
tribe
however
large
is
all
one
great
family
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
and
though
no
one
from
without
could
be
admitted
to
the
supreme
rule
any
one
from
within
the
tribe
can
hold
office
but
in
practice
the
choice
is
limited
to
a
few
persons
the
reverence
of
the
arabs
for
blood
and
for
selected
strains
of
blood
prevent
them
except
in
very
exceptional
cases
from
changing
the
dynasty
of
their
rulers
if
the
dead
man
has
left
behind
him
a
son
of
full
age
and
respectable
qualities
he
will
without
dispute
be
acknowledged
sheykh
if
not
an
uncle
a
nephew
or
a
cousin
will
be
chosen
only
in
extreme
circumstances
of
general
danger
or
of
failure
of
heirs
male
can
the
member
of
a
new
family
reasonably
aspire
to
power
moreover
there
is
no
uniform
law
of
election
the
meeting
does
not
pretend
to
give
a
right
only
to
confirm
one
for
the
right
lies
not
with
the
electors
but
with
him
who
can
maintain
his
election
there
is
therefore
no
formal
system
of
voting
but
the
elders
having
ascertained
who
among
the
dead
man
relations
commands
the
strongest
following
proceed
to
acknowledge
him
by
the
ceremony
of
giving
him
their
hands
he
then
becomes
their
sheykh
it
sometimes
happens
however
that
parties
are
so
evenly
divided
between
rival
leaders
that
the
tribe
divides
one
section
going
this
way
and
the
other
that
until
one
of
the
leaders
gives
in
his
submission
otherwise
the
quarrel
is
decided
by
the
sword
all
these
features
of
the
arabian
tribal
system
of
succession
may
be
noticed
in
the
first
elections
to
the
caliphate
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
mohammed
was
indeed
dead
a
conclave
composed
of
the
elders
and
chief
men
of
islam
and
recognizing
no
special
popular
mandate
assembled
in
the
house
of
omar
ibn
el
khattub
this
conclave
is
known
to
jurists
as
the
el
helli
wa
el
the
people
of
the
loosing
and
the
knotting
because
they
assumed
the
duty
of
solving
the
knotty
question
of
succession
a
nice
point
had
to
be
decided
just
such
a
one
as
has
in
all
ages
been
the
cause
of
civil
war
in
arabia
the
prophet
had
left
no
son
but
more
than
one
near
relation
moreover
at
that
moment
the
new
nation
of
islam
was
in
danger
of
internal
disruption
and
the
religious
and
the
civil
elements
in
it
were
on
the
point
of
taking
up
arms
against
each
other
the
two
chief
candidates
were
ali
ibn
abutaleb
and
abu
bekr
the
one
and
cousin
and
the
other
of
mohammed
ali
represented
the
civil
abu
bekr
the
religious
party
and
as
it
happened
that
the
latter
party
was
predominant
at
medina
it
was
on
abu
bekr
that
the
choice
fell
he
was
recognized
as
head
of
the
more
powerful
faction
and
the
chiefs
gave
him
their
hands
while
civil
war
was
only
prevented
by
the
magnanimous
submission
of
ali
this
form
of
succession
is
held
by
most
sunite
doctors
to
be
the
authentic
form
intended
by
the
prophet
nor
did
the
three
following
elections
differ
from
it
in
any
essential
point
it
is
only
noticed
that
abu
bekr
designated
omar
as
the
most
fitting
person
to
succeed
him
and
so
in
a
measure
directed
the
choice
of
the
ahl
el
agde
the
caliph
was
in
each
instance
elected
by
the
elders
at
medina
and
the
choice
confirmed
by
its
general
acknowledgment
elsewhere
in
the
time
of
ali
however
a
new
principle
began
to
make
its
appearance
which
foreshadowed
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
caliphate
the
election
of
abu
bekr
as
i
have
said
was
determined
by
the
predominant
religious
feeling
of
the
day
he
was
the
holiest
man
in
islam
and
his
government
was
throughout
strictly
theocratic
he
not
only
administered
the
religious
law
but
was
its
interpreter
and
architect
he
sat
every
day
in
the
or
open
court
of
justice
and
decided
there
questions
of
divinity
as
well
as
of
jurisprudence
he
publicly
led
the
prayer
in
the
mosque
expounded
the
koran
and
preached
every
friday
from
the
pulpit
he
combined
in
his
person
all
the
functions
now
divided
between
the
sheykh
el
islam
the
grand
mufti
and
the
executive
authorities
he
was
king
and
priest
and
magistrate
doctor
of
civil
and
religious
law
and
supreme
referee
on
all
matters
whether
of
opinion
or
practice
he
was
in
a
word
the
pope
of
islam
nor
did
his
three
successors
abate
anything
of
abu
bekr
pretensions
the
only
power
they
delegated
was
the
command
of
the
mussulman
armies
which
were
then
overrunning
the
world
and
the
government
of
the
provinces
these
had
conquered
ali
however
when
he
at
last
succeeded
to
the
caliphate
found
himself
opposed
by
the
very
party
whose
candidate
he
had
once
been
and
this
party
had
gathered
strength
in
the
interval
with
the
conquest
of
the
world
worldly
ideas
had
filled
the
hearts
of
mussulmans
and
a
strong
reaction
also
had
set
in
in
favour
of
those
specially
national
ideas
of
arabia
which
religious
fervour
had
hitherto
held
in
check
it
was
natural
indeed
inevitable
that
this
should
be
the
case
for
many
conquered
nations
had
embraced
the
faith
of
islam
and
as
mussulmans
had
become
the
equals
of
their
conquerors
so
that
what
elements
of
pride
existed
in
these
found
their
gratification
in
ideas
of
race
and
birth
rather
than
of
religion
ideas
which
the
conquered
races
could
not
share
and
which
were
the
special
inheritance
of
arabia
the
national
party
then
had
been
reinforced
at
the
expense
of
the
religious
among
the
koreysh
who
were
still
at
the
head
of
all
the
affairs
of
state
their
leader
was
mawiyeh
ibn
ommiyeh
a
man
of
distinguished
ability
and
of
that
charm
of
manner
which
arabs
know
so
well
how
to
use
to
their
political
ends
he
had
for
some
years
been
governor
of
syria
and
was
more
popular
there
than
the
pious
ali
and
syria
though
not
yet
the
nominal
was
already
the
real
seat
of
the
mussulman
government
mawiyeh
therefore
refused
to
accept
ali
election
at
medina
as
valid
and
finding
himself
supported
by
a
rival
ahl
el
agde
at
damascus
made
that
appeal
to
the
sword
which
arabian
usage
sanctions
as
the
ultimate
right
of
all
pretenders
religious
writers
agree
in
condemning
mawiyeh
for
his
revolt
and
while
his
succession
to
ali
is
accepted
as
legal
they
place
him
on
quite
a
different
level
from
the
four
caliphs
who
preceded
him
in
mawiyeh
they
see
fulfilled
that
prediction
of
their
prophet
which
announced
that
islam
should
be
ruled
for
thirty
years
by
an
imam
and
ever
after
by
a
king
mawiyeh
is
indeed
the
type
of
all
the
later
mohammedan
emperors
according
to
canon
law
the
head
of
the
state
is
also
head
of
the
religion
but
mawiyeh
ceased
to
exercise
religious
functions
in
person
these
unlike
his
predecessors
he
delegated
to
others
and
neither
led
the
prayer
nor
preached
nor
was
he
held
to
be
either
the
best
or
the
most
learned
man
in
islam
as
abu
bekr
and
the
rest
had
been
moreover
and
this
is
the
chief
point
noticed
regarding
him
he
introduced
the
system
of
dynastic
heredity
into
the
caliphate
nominating
his
son
yezid
his
successor
in
his
own
lifetime
the
change
advantageous
as
it
was
politically
is
regarded
as
a
religious
falling
off
henceforth
the
caliphs
whether
of
the
ommiad
or
afterwards
of
the
abbaside
families
were
not
in
reality
elected
though
the
form
of
confirmation
by
the
ulema
was
gone
through
and
they
affected
to
succeed
by
right
of
birth
not
by
the
voice
of
the
people
during
the
whole
period
of
the
arabian
caliphate
we
only
notice
one
prince
of
the
faithful
who
busied
himself
much
with
religious
learning
and
few
who
personally
exercised
the
magisterial
functions
only
once
we
read
of
an
abbaside
caliph
insisting
on
his
right
of
leading
the
prayer
and
this
was
probably
the
effect
of
an
accidental
jealousy
as
a
rule
the
temporal
government
of
islam
was
intrusted
to
a
or
grand
vizier
the
spiritual
duty
of
prayer
to
a
or
deputy
imam
and
the
elaboration
or
interpretation
of
law
and
doctrine
to
such
ulema
or
mujtaheddin
as
could
command
a
following
the
character
of
the
khalifeh
however
was
still
essentially
sacred
he
was
of
the
koreysh
and
of
the
blood
of
the
prophet
and
so
was
distinct
from
the
other
princes
of
the
world
as
their
political
power
decayed
the
abbasides
fell
indeed
into
the
hands
of
adventurers
who
even
occasionally
used
them
as
puppets
for
their
own
ambitious
ends
but
the
office
was
respected
and
neither
the
kurdish
saladdin
nor
togral
bey
nor
malek
shah
nor
any
of
the
seljukian
emirs
el
amara
dared
meddle
personally
with
the
title
of
caliph
the
ommiad
dynasty
founded
by
mawiyeh
reigned
at
damascus
years
and
was
then
succeeded
on
a
new
appeal
to
the
sword
in
by
the
descendants
of
another
branch
of
the
koreysh
the
beni
abbas
who
transferred
the
capital
of
islam
to
bagdad
and
survived
as
temporal
sovereigns
there
for
five
hundred
years
this
second
period
of
islam
though
containing
her
greatest
glories
and
her
highest
worldly
prosperity
is
held
to
be
less
complete
by
divines
than
the
first
thirty
years
which
had
preceded
it
islam
was
no
longer
one
to
say
nothing
of
the
persian
and
arabian
schisms
the
orthodox
world
itself
was
divided
and
rival
caliphs
had
established
themselves
independently
in
spain
and
egypt
moreover
during
the
last
two
centuries
the
temporal
power
of
the
caliphs
was
practically
in
delegation
to
the
seljuk
turks
who
acted
as
mayors
of
the
palace
and
their
spiritual
power
was
unsupported
by
any
show
of
sanctity
or
learning
it
was
terminated
forcibly
by
the
pagan
holagu
who
at
the
head
of
the
mongols
sacked
bagdad
in
the
third
period
of
caliphal
history
saw
all
temporal
power
wrested
from
the
caliphs
islam
on
the
destruction
of
the
arabian
monarchy
resolved
itself
into
a
number
of
separate
states
each
governed
by
its
own
bey
or
sultan
who
in
his
quality
of
temporal
prince
was
head
also
of
religion
within
his
own
dominions
the
mongols
converted
to
the
faith
of
mecca
founded
a
mohammedan
empire
in
the
east
the
seljuk
turks
replaced
by
the
ottoman
reigned
in
asia
minor
the
barbary
states
had
their
own
rulers
and
egypt
was
governed
by
that
strange
dynasty
of
slaves
the
mameluke
sultans
nowhere
was
a
supreme
temporal
head
of
islam
to
be
seen
and
the
name
of
khalifeh
as
that
of
a
reigning
sovereign
ceased
any
longer
to
be
heard
of
in
the
world
only
the
nominal
succession
of
the
prophet
was
obscurely
preserved
at
cairo
whither
the
survivors
of
the
family
of
abbas
had
betaken
themselves
on
the
massacre
of
their
house
at
bagdad
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
the
precise
position
of
these
titular
caliphs
under
the
mameluke
monarchy
in
egypt
that
they
were
little
known
to
the
world
in
general
is
certain
and
one
is
sometimes
tempted
to
suspect
the
complete
authenticity
of
the
succession
preserved
through
them
contemporary
christian
writers
do
not
mention
them
and
it
is
evident
from
sir
john
mandeville
and
others
that
in
egypt
the
egyptian
sultan
himself
was
talked
of
as
head
of
the
mussulman
religion
i
have
heard
their
position
compared
with
that
of
the
present
sheykhs
el
islam
at
constantinople
that
is
to
say
they
were
appointed
by
the
sultan
and
were
made
use
of
by
him
as
a
means
of
securing
mussulman
allegiance
and
i
believe
this
to
have
been
all
their
real
status
they
are
cited
however
as
in
some
sense
sovereigns
by
hanefite
teachers
whose
argument
it
is
that
the
succession
of
the
prophet
has
never
lapsed
or
islam
been
without
a
recognized
temporal
head
the
sultans
neither
of
egypt
nor
of
india
nor
till
selim
time
of
the
turkish
empire
ever
claimed
for
themselves
the
title
of
khalifeh
nor
did
the
sherifal
family
of
mecca
who
alone
of
them
might
have
claimed
it
legally
as
koreysh
neither
did
tamerlane
nor
any
of
the
mussulman
mongols
who
reigned
at
bagdad
the
fact
is
we
may
assume
the
caliphate
was
clean
forgotten
at
the
time
selim
bethought
him
of
it
as
an
instrument
of
power
it
must
then
have
been
an
interesting
and
startling
novelty
with
mussulmans
to
hear
of
this
new
pretender
to
the
ancient
dignity
interesting
because
the
name
khalifeh
was
connected
with
so
many
of
the
bygone
glories
of
islam
startling
because
he
who
claimed
it
seemed
by
birth
incapable
of
doing
so
the
hanefite
ulema
however
as
i
have
said
undertook
selim
defence
or
rather
that
of
his
successors
for
selim
himself
died
not
a
year
afterwards
and
succeeded
in
proving
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
majority
of
sunites
that
the
house
of
othman
had
a
good
and
valid
title
to
the
rank
they
had
assumed
their
chief
arguments
were
as
follows
the
house
of
othman
they
asserted
ruled
spiritually
by
right
of
the
that
is
to
say
the
possession
of
the
sovereign
title
it
was
argued
that
the
caliphate
being
a
necessity
and
this
all
orthodox
mussulmans
admit
it
was
also
necessary
that
the
holder
of
the
title
should
be
recognized
as
legally
the
caliph
a
claimant
with
a
better
title
should
now
the
first
qualification
of
a
claimant
was
that
he
should
claim
and
the
second
that
he
should
be
supported
by
a
party
and
selim
had
both
claimed
the
caliphate
and
supported
his
pretensions
at
the
head
of
an
army
he
had
challenged
the
world
to
produce
a
rival
and
no
rival
had
been
found
none
at
least
which
the
hanefite
school
acknowledged
for
the
sultan
of
morocco
they
had
never
accepted
and
the
last
descendant
of
the
abbasides
had
waived
his
rights
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
the
sword
could
give
a
title
they
cited
the
examples
of
mawiyeh
who
thus
established
his
right
against
the
family
of
ali
and
of
abu
el
abbas
who
had
thus
established
his
against
that
of
mawiyeh
that
is
the
sanction
of
a
legal
body
of
elders
it
was
argued
that
as
the
ahl
el
agde
had
been
removed
from
medina
to
damascus
and
from
damascus
to
bagdad
and
from
bagdad
to
cairo
so
it
had
been
once
more
legally
removed
from
cairo
to
constantinople
selim
had
brought
with
him
to
sophia
some
of
the
ulema
of
the
azhar
mosque
in
cairo
and
these
in
conjunction
with
the
turkish
ulema
had
elected
him
or
ratified
his
election
a
form
of
election
is
to
the
present
day
observed
at
constantinople
in
token
of
this
right
and
each
new
sultan
of
the
house
of
othman
as
he
succeeds
to
the
temporal
sovereignty
of
turkey
must
wait
before
being
recognized
as
caliph
till
he
has
received
the
sword
of
office
at
the
hands
of
the
ulema
this
ceremony
it
is
customary
to
perform
in
the
mosque
of
ayub
sultan
selim
as
has
been
already
said
obtained
from
mutawakkel
a
descendant
of
the
abbasides
and
himself
titularly
caliph
a
full
cession
of
all
the
caliphal
rights
of
that
family
the
fact
as
far
as
it
goes
is
historical
and
the
only
flaw
in
the
argument
would
seem
to
be
that
mutawakkel
had
no
right
thus
to
dispose
of
a
title
to
an
alien
which
was
his
own
only
in
virtue
of
his
birth
the
case
indeed
was
very
much
as
though
the
emperor
of
germany
having
possessed
himself
of
london
should
obtain
from
don
carlos
a
cession
of
the
throne
of
spain
or
as
though
napoleon
should
have
got
such
a
cession
of
the
papacy
in
from
pius
vii
still
it
is
insisted
upon
strongly
by
the
hanefite
divines
as
giving
a
more
permanent
dynastic
title
than
either
of
the
previous
pleas
as
a
precedent
for
nomination
they
cite
the
act
of
abu
bekr
who
on
his
recommended
omar
as
his
successor
in
the
caliphate
guardianship
of
the
two
that
is
to
say
of
mecca
and
jerusalem
but
especially
of
mecca
it
has
been
asserted
by
some
of
the
ulema
and
it
is
certainly
a
common
opinion
at
the
present
day
that
the
sovereignty
of
hejaz
is
in
itself
sufficient
title
to
the
caliphate
it
seems
certainly
to
have
been
so
considered
in
the
first
age
of
islam
and
many
a
bloody
war
was
then
fought
for
the
right
of
protecting
the
beyt
allah
but
the
connection
of
hejaz
with
the
empire
of
the
caliphs
has
been
too
often
broken
to
make
this
a
very
tenable
argument
in
the
tenth
century
it
was
held
by
the
karmathian
heretics
in
the
thirteenth
by
the
imams
of
sana
and
for
seven
years
in
the
present
century
by
the
wahhabis
still
the
sovereignty
of
the
harameyn
or
two
shrines
was
one
of
selim
pleas
and
it
is
one
which
has
reappeared
in
modern
arguments
respecting
the
caliphal
rights
of
his
descendants
of
the
or
sacred
relics
this
last
was
a
plea
addressed
to
the
vulgar
rather
than
to
the
learned
but
it
is
one
which
can
not
be
passed
by
unnoticed
here
for
it
exercises
a
powerful
influence
at
the
present
day
over
the
ignorant
mass
of
mussulmans
it
was
asserted
and
is
still
a
pious
belief
that
from
the
sack
of
bagdad
in
certain
relics
of
the
prophet
and
his
companions
were
saved
and
brought
to
cairo
and
thence
transferred
by
selim
to
constantinople
these
were
represented
to
constitute
the
imperial
insignia
of
office
and
their
possession
to
give
a
title
to
the
caliphal
succession
they
consisted
of
the
cloak
of
the
prophet
borne
by
his
soldiers
as
a
standard
of
some
hairs
from
his
beard
and
of
the
sword
of
omar
the
vulgar
believe
them
to
be
still
preserved
in
the
mosque
of
ayub
and
though
the
ulema
no
longer
insist
on
their
authenticity
they
are
often
referred
to
as
an
additional
test
of
the
sultan
right
such
then
were
the
arguments
of
the
hanefite
school
who
defended
selim
claim
and
such
they
are
with
regard
to
his
successors
of
the
house
of
othman
by
the
world
at
large
they
seem
to
have
been
pretty
generally
accepted
the
more
so
as
the
turkish
sultans
having
only
a
political
end
in
view
were
satisfied
with
their
formal
recognition
by
their
own
subjects
and
did
not
bring
the
question
to
an
issue
with
their
independent
neighbours
neither
the
mogul
emperors
at
delhi
nor
the
sheriffs
of
morocco
were
called
upon
to
acknowledge
temporal
or
spiritual
supremacy
in
the
ottoman
sultans
nor
did
these
affect
an
use
of
the
ancient
title
they
had
assumed
in
india
the
head
of
the
house
of
othman
was
still
known
to
moslems
as
padishah
or
sultan
er
roum
the
roman
emperor
the
most
powerful
of
mussulman
princes
but
not
in
any
special
manner
the
head
of
their
religion
certainly
not
their
sovereign
the
ulema
indeed
such
as
were
hanefites
admitted
him
to
be
legally
khalifeh
but
many
of
the
shafite
school
denied
this
pleading
still
that
as
an
alien
to
the
koreysh
his
claim
was
illegal
while
to
the
ignorant
mass
of
the
people
out
of
his
dominions
his
spiritual
title
remained
almost
unknown
the
sultans
themselves
were
doubtless
to
blame
for
this
seeing
that
the
spiritual
functions
of
their
new
office
were
left
almost
entirely
unperformed
for
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
on
that
the
assumption
of
the
caliphate
was
to
the
house
of
othman
only
a
means
to
an
end
viz
the
consolidation
of
its
worldly
power
upon
a
recognized
basis
and
that
once
that
end
obtained
the
temporal
dignity
of
sultan
was
all
that
they
really
considered
thus
they
never
sought
to
exercise
the
right
appertaining
to
the
caliphal
office
of
appointing
naïbs
or
deputy
imams
in
the
lands
outside
their
dominions
or
to
interfere
with
doctrinal
matters
at
home
except
where
such
might
prejudice
the
interests
of
their
rule
with
regard
to
these
the
theologians
of
constantinople
having
satisfactorily
settled
the
caliphal
dispute
and
pronounced
the
house
of
othman
for
ever
heirs
to
the
dignity
they
had
assumed
were
recommended
by
the
head
of
the
state
to
busy
themselves
no
further
with
doctrinal
matters
and
to
consider
the
or
development
of
new
dogma
altogether
closed
for
the
future
in
their
schools
soliman
the
magnificent
selim
heir
especially
insisted
upon
this
he
had
already
promulgated
a
series
of
decrees
affecting
the
civil
administration
of
his
empire
which
he
had
declared
to
be
immutable
and
an
immutability
too
in
dogma
he
thought
would
still
further
secure
the
peace
and
stability
of
his
rule
nor
did
he
meet
with
aught
but
approval
here
from
the
hanefite
divines
the
turkish
ulema
ever
since
their
first
appearance
in
the
arabian
schools
in
the
eleventh
century
finding
themselves
at
a
disadvantage
through
their
ignorance
of
the
sacred
language
and
being
constitutionally
adverse
to
intellectual
effort
had
maintained
the
proposition
that
mental
repose
was
the
true
feature
of
orthodoxy
and
in
their
had
consistently
relied
on
authority
and
rejected
original
argument
they
therefore
readily
seconded
the
sultan
in
his
views
argument
on
first
principles
was
formally
forbidden
in
the
schools
and
for
the
interpretation
of
existing
law
two
offices
were
invented
the
one
for
dogmatic
the
other
for
practical
decisions
those
of
the
sheykh
el
islam
and
the
great
mufti
this
closing
of
doctrinal
inquiry
by
the
ottoman
sultans
and
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
supreme
spiritual
government
from
the
arabian
atmosphere
of
cairo
to
the
tartar
atmosphere
of
the
bosphorus
was
the
direct
and
immediate
cause
of
the
religious
stagnation
which
islam
suffered
from
so
conspicuously
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
we
have
now
brought
the
history
of
the
caliphate
down
to
the
period
described
in
the
last
chapter
as
one
of
intellectual
torpor
for
islam
it
was
a
lethargy
from
which
there
seemed
no
awakening
and
which
to
contemporaries
voltaire
among
the
rest
seemed
closely
approximating
to
the
death
of
unbelief
in
spite
of
soliman
eternal
arrangements
the
temporal
power
of
the
house
of
othman
was
wofully
diminished
and
the
spiritual
prestige
of
the
sultans
was
gone
with
mussulmans
by
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
title
of
caliph
even
in
their
own
dominions
was
all
but
forgotten
and
the
court
of
constantinople
was
become
a
byword
for
its
vice
and
infidelity
it
can
therefore
be
well
imagined
that
the
awakening
of
religious
feeling
which
i
also
described
as
having
been
produced
by
the
wahhabite
movement
especially
menaced
the
sultan
in
his
caliphal
pretensions
by
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
the
serious
world
of
islam
was
already
ripening
for
a
change
and
the
title
of
the
caliphate
seemed
open
to
whoever
should
and
prove
himself
worthy
to
wear
it
two
men
certainly
then
dreamed
of
its
acquisition
both
men
of
supreme
genius
and
holding
the
elements
of
success
in
their
hands
nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
either
of
them
would
have
achieved
his
ambition
but
for
the
appearance
against
them
of
a
material
power
greater
than
their
own
and
which
then
for
the
first
time
began
to
make
itself
felt
as
paramount
in
asia
that
power
was
england
and
the
ambitions
she
thwarted
there
were
those
of
bonaparte
and
mehemet
ali
it
is
not
i
believe
sufficiently
understood
how
vast
a
scheme
was
overthrown
by
the
battle
of
the
nile
napoleon
mind
was
formed
for
dominion
in
the
east
and
where
he
failed
in
europe
he
would
have
infallibly
succeeded
in
asia
there
little
policies
are
useless
and
great
ones
root
themselves
in
a
congenial
soil
and
he
was
possessed
with
an
idea
which
must
have
flourished
his
english
opponents
judging
him
only
by
the
scale
of
their
own
thoughts
credited
him
with
the
inferior
design
of
invading
india
through
persia
and
called
it
a
mad
one
but
india
was
in
fact
a
small
part
only
of
his
programme
when
he
publicly
pronounced
the
kelemat
at
cairo
and
professed
the
faith
of
islam
he
intended
to
be
its
head
arguing
rightly
that
what
had
been
possible
three
hundred
years
before
to
selim
was
possible
also
then
to
him
nor
would
the
mussulman
world
have
been
much
more
astonished
in
at
being
asked
to
accept
a
bonaparte
for
caliph
than
it
was
in
at
being
asked
to
accept
an
ottoman
with
napoleon
genius
for
war
and
but
for
the
disastrous
sea
fight
on
the
nile
all
this
might
have
been
and
more
and
it
is
conceivable
that
europe
taken
in
reverse
by
a
great
moslem
multitude
might
have
suffered
worse
disasters
than
any
the
actual
napoleonic
wars
procured
her
while
a
more
durable
empire
might
have
been
founded
on
the
nile
or
bosphorus
than
the
bonapartes
were
able
to
establish
on
the
seine
as
it
was
it
was
an
episode
and
no
more
useful
only
to
the
few
who
saw
it
near
enough
to
admire
and
understand
among
these
who
saw
and
understood
was
mehemet
ali
the
albanian
adventurer
who
undertook
the
government
of
egypt
when
england
restored
it
to
the
porte
bonaparte
from
the
first
was
his
model
and
he
inherited
from
him
this
vision
of
a
new
caliphate
the
greatest
of
the
napoleonic
ideas
and
worked
persistently
to
realize
it
he
was
within
an
ace
of
succeeding
in
mehemet
ali
had
mecca
cairo
and
jerusalem
in
his
hands
and
he
had
defeated
the
sultan
at
konia
and
was
advancing
through
asia
minor
on
constantinople
there
without
doubt
he
would
have
proclaimed
himself
caliph
having
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
sultan
admitted
right
on
which
to
found
a
new
claim
nor
is
it
probable
that
he
would
have
found
much
religious
opposition
to
the
realization
of
his
scheme
from
the
turkish
ulema
these
already
alarmed
by
sultan
murad
administrative
reforms
would
hardly
have
espoused
the
sultan
defence
with
any
vigour
and
though
mehemet
ali
himself
was
open
to
a
charge
of
latitudinarianism
he
had
the
one
great
claim
upon
orthodox
islam
of
having
delivered
the
holy
cities
of
mecca
and
medina
from
the
wahhabis
the
house
of
othman
indeed
at
this
time
had
begun
to
stink
not
only
in
the
nostrils
of
the
outside
world
but
in
that
of
the
hanefite
school
itself
and
as
these
had
formerly
accepted
selim
so
they
might
very
well
in
have
accepted
mehemet
ali
but
this
attempt
too
was
stopped
by
england
in
pursuance
of
a
policy
which
it
is
difficult
now
not
to
regret
the
too
venturous
arnaout
was
sent
back
to
his
in
egypt
and
the
house
of
othman
was
entrusted
with
a
new
lease
of
spiritual
sovereignty
if
not
yet
of
spiritual
power
the
reigns
of
abd
el
mejid
and
of
abd
el
aziz
are
remarkable
with
mussulmans
as
having
witnessed
a
complete
dissociation
of
interests
between
the
imperial
government
and
the
old
hanefite
school
of
ulema
i
have
no
space
here
to
discuss
the
nature
of
the
reforms
attempted
and
partly
effected
in
the
ottoman
empire
between
the
years
and
as
a
concession
to
the
clamour
of
europe
they
were
instituted
not
by
and
through
religion
as
they
should
have
been
but
in
defiance
of
it
and
so
failed
to
find
acceptance
anywhere
with
religious
people
all
changes
so
attempted
must
fail
in
islam
because
they
have
in
them
the
inevitable
vice
of
illegality
and
i
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
of
explaining
later
the
manner
in
which
alone
a
true
reform
can
hope
to
find
acceptance
for
the
present
i
only
note
the
promulgation
of
the
hatti
humayoum
and
its
kindred
decrees
as
points
in
the
history
of
the
ottoman
caliphate
decline
and
as
direct
reasons
for
the
reactionary
change
of
front
which
we
now
witness
in
the
policy
of
constantinople
abd
el
mejid
for
his
attempts
gained
with
mussulmans
the
name
of
an
unbeliever
and
his
son
was
deposed
in
the
way
we
all
know
as
a
breaker
of
the
religious
law
for
a
moment
however
abd
el
aziz
seems
to
have
seen
the
true
nature
of
his
position
and
to
have
had
some
idea
of
the
required
of
him
as
the
following
incident
will
show
it
marks
at
any
rate
the
epoch
pretty
exactly
when
a
revival
of
the
sultan
spiritual
pretensions
as
a
settled
policy
was
first
resolved
on
in
turkey
the
circumstances
have
been
narrated
to
me
as
follows
quite
in
the
early
days
of
abd
el
aziz
reign
a
certain
statesman
a
man
of
original
genius
and
profoundly
versed
in
the
knowledge
both
of
europe
and
of
the
east
and
especially
of
the
religious
history
of
islam
came
to
constantinople
he
was
a
friend
of
rushdi
pasha
then
the
grand
vizier
and
of
others
of
the
party
of
young
turkey
men
who
were
seeking
by
every
means
fair
and
foul
to
reorganize
and
strengthen
the
central
authority
of
the
empire
to
these
and
subsequently
in
an
interview
to
the
sultan
himself
he
urged
the
advantage
which
might
accrue
to
the
ottoman
government
both
as
a
means
of
controlling
the
provinces
and
as
a
weapon
against
european
diplomacy
if
the
spiritual
authority
of
the
sultan
as
caliph
were
put
more
prominently
forward
he
suggested
especially
to
abd
el
aziz
that
his
real
strength
lay
in
the
reorganization
not
of
his
temporal
but
of
his
spiritual
forces
and
he
expressed
his
wonder
that
so
evident
a
source
of
strength
had
been
so
little
drawn
on
he
pointed
out
the
importance
of
the
mussulman
populations
outside
the
empire
to
the
sultan
and
urged
that
these
should
be
brought
as
much
as
possible
within
the
sphere
of
constantinople
influence
the
barbary
states
mussulman
india
and
central
asia
might
thus
become
to
all
intents
and
purposes
save
that
of
tribute
subjects
of
the
porte
in
early
times
it
had
been
a
duty
of
the
caliphs
to
appoint
in
all
the
provinces
of
islam
imams
or
deputies
to
represent
their
spiritual
authority
and
it
was
suggested
that
these
should
once
more
be
appointed
an
imam
or
leader
of
their
public
prayer
is
a
necessity
with
orthodox
mussulmans
and
in
default
of
legal
appointment
from
the
caliph
who
is
himself
the
supreme
imam
the
faithful
had
been
constrained
to
apply
either
to
the
local
governments
for
such
appointment
or
to
elect
the
functionary
themselves
this
they
acknowledged
to
be
illegal
and
would
willingly
revert
to
the
more
legitimate
system
while
the
of
such
a
hierarchy
would
bring
an
enormous
accession
of
spiritual
power
to
constantinople
it
was
also
shown
to
abd
el
aziz
how
arabia
was
to
his
position
and
how
greatly
the
means
of
influence
there
had
been
neglected
i
am
informed
by
one
present
at
this
interview
that
abd
el
aziz
was
not
only
delighted
at
the
idea
but
profoundly
astonished
he
seems
to
have
had
no
notion
previously
either
of
the
historical
dignity
of
the
spiritual
office
he
held
nor
of
its
prerogatives
and
for
a
while
his
thoughts
were
turned
in
the
direction
pointed
out
to
him
he
sent
for
the
chief
ulema
and
asked
them
if
all
he
heard
was
true
and
when
he
found
their
ideas
to
be
entirely
in
unison
with
the
advice
just
given
him
he
commissioned
the
sheykh
el
islam
to
push
forward
the
doctrine
of
his
spiritual
leadership
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
missionaries
were
consequently
despatched
to
every
part
of
the
mussulman
world
and
especially
to
india
and
the
barbary
states
to
explain
the
hanefite
dogma
of
the
caliphate
and
though
at
first
these
met
with
little
success
they
eventually
gained
their
object
in
those
countries
where
believers
were
obliged
to
live
under
infidel
rule
so
much
so
that
in
a
few
years
the
ottoman
caliphate
became
once
more
a
recognized
question
in
the
schools
they
were
aided
in
this
by
a
powerful
instrument
then
first
employed
in
turkey
the
press
a
newspaper
in
arabic
called
the
was
subsidized
at
constantinople
under
the
direction
of
one
achmet
faris
a
convert
to
islam
and
a
man
of
great
literary
ability
and
knowledge
of
arabic
who
already
had
views
on
the
subject
of
the
caliphate
and
this
organ
henceforth
consistently
advocated
the
new
policy
of
the
ulema
the
official
clique
in
stamboul
were
however
at
that
time
still
intent
on
other
projects
and
only
half
understood
the
part
to
be
played
by
religion
in
their
scheme
of
administrative
reform
for
the
empire
besides
and
this
was
the
chief
hindrance
to
the
ulema
abd
el
aziz
was
not
a
man
capable
of
seriously
carrying
out
a
great
political
idea
being
little
else
than
a
man
of
pleasure
he
and
his
government
consequently
soon
drifted
back
into
the
groove
of
his
material
policy
which
relied
for
its
strength
on
the
physical
force
of
arms
foreign
loans
and
the
intrigues
of
officials
the
only
practical
action
taken
by
ottoman
ministers
in
the
line
indicated
were
the
twin
crusades
proclaimed
against
the
wahhabis
of
hasa
and
the
heretical
imams
of
sana
but
the
hanefite
ulema
were
not
thus
to
be
satisfied
they
had
determined
on
carrying
out
the
idea
they
had
adopted
and
on
forcing
the
sultan
to
put
himself
openly
at
the
head
of
a
religious
and
reactionary
movement
and
when
they
found
that
abd
el
aziz
could
not
be
made
to
act
consistently
as
caliph
they
deposed
him
and
thus
opened
a
way
for
the
true
hero
of
their
idea
the
present
sultan
abd
el
hamid
the
advent
of
this
latest
scion
of
the
house
of
othman
to
the
spiritual
succession
of
the
prophet
though
a
godsend
in
appearance
to
religious
moslems
can
not
but
be
regarded
by
all
who
wish
islam
well
as
a
very
great
misfortune
it
is
almost
certain
that
if
abd
el
mejid
and
abd
el
aziz
had
been
succeeded
by
another
of
those
senseless
monarchs
who
have
so
often
filled
the
imperial
throne
the
ottoman
caliphate
would
already
have
been
a
thing
of
the
past
at
least
as
regards
the
larger
and
more
intelligent
part
of
islam
in
the
collapse
of
its
physical
power
in
the
official
camarilla
of
constantinople
would
have
been
unable
to
control
the
movement
of
revolt
against
the
spiritual
and
temporal
sovereignty
of
the
sultan
and
something
would
have
taken
its
place
offering
a
more
possible
foundation
for
true
religious
reform
arabia
would
in
all
probability
have
by
this
time
asserted
its
independence
and
under
a
new
caliphate
of
the
koreysh
would
have
been
attracting
the
sympathies
and
the
adhesion
of
the
eastern
world
there
might
have
been
schisms
and
religious
convulsions
but
at
least
there
would
have
been
life
and
what
islam
requires
is
to
live
but
unfortunately
abd
el
hamid
was
neither
a
mere
voluptuary
nor
an
imbecile
and
catching
by
an
instinct
which
one
can
not
but
admire
the
one
rope
of
safety
which
remained
for
him
and
his
house
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
extreme
reactionary
party
of
islam
and
thus
put
back
for
a
while
the
hour
of
fate
it
is
difficult
to
gain
accurate
information
as
to
abd
el
character
and
religious
opinions
but
i
believe
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
he
represents
in
these
latter
the
extremest
hanefite
views
in
youth
he
was
for
a
prince
a
serious
man
showing
a
taste
for
learning
especially
for
geography
and
history
and
though
not
an
he
has
some
knowledge
of
his
religion
it
may
therefore
be
taken
for
granted
that
he
is
sincere
in
his
belief
of
his
own
spiritual
position
it
is
easy
to
be
sincere
where
one
interest
lies
in
believing
and
i
have
it
from
one
who
saw
him
at
the
time
that
on
the
day
soon
after
his
accession
when
according
to
the
custom
already
mentioned
he
received
the
sword
at
the
mosque
of
ayub
he
astonished
his
courtiers
with
the
sudden
change
in
his
demeanour
all
the
afternoon
of
that
day
he
talked
to
them
of
his
spiritual
rank
in
language
which
for
centuries
had
not
been
heard
in
the
precincts
of
the
seraglio
it
is
certain
too
that
his
first
act
when
delivered
from
the
pressure
of
the
russian
invasion
was
to
organize
afresh
the
propagandism
already
begun
and
to
send
out
new
missionaries
to
india
and
the
barbary
states
to
preach
the
doctrine
of
his
own
caliphal
authority
to
the
moslems
partibus
his
language
too
to
strangers
from
external
islam
was
from
the
first
that
of
a
spiritual
rather
than
a
temporal
prince
and
with
the
european
ambassadors
he
has
used
this
position
consistently
and
most
effectually
it
is
no
mean
proof
of
abd
el
hamid
ability
that
he
should
have
invented
the
mussulman
with
which
he
has
disconcerted
our
diplomacy
in
private
life
he
is
said
to
be
regular
at
his
prayers
though
it
is
also
said
that
he
conforms
to
the
custom
of
turkish
sultans
in
avoiding
legal
marriage
he
is
at
the
same
time
a
liberal
patron
of
dervishes
workers
of
miracles
and
holy
men
these
he
is
at
pains
to
seek
out
and
receive
honourably
in
his
administration
he
conforms
wherever
he
is
himself
the
actor
strictly
to
the
sheriat
and
on
doubtful
points
consults
always
the
mufti
or
sheykh
el
islam
he
has
shown
no
inconsiderable
firmness
in
resisting
european
demands
when
they
contravened
the
canon
law
for
all
these
reasons
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
abd
el
hamid
has
gained
not
only
the
support
of
his
own
turkish
ulema
but
the
sympathy
of
a
very
considerable
section
of
opinion
outside
his
dominions
from
a
traitor
to
the
cause
of
religion
the
ottoman
sultan
has
come
to
be
looked
upon
east
and
west
as
once
more
its
champion
and
with
the
reactionary
school
abd
el
hamid
is
fast
growing
into
a
hero
a
year
ago
when
i
was
at
jeddah
this
was
not
yet
the
case
but
it
would
seem
to
be
so
now
then
even
the
people
of
his
own
party
spoke
of
him
doubtfully
and
he
certainly
excited
no
enthusiasm
among
them
they
did
not
understand
him
and
thought
that
he
was
playing
a
part
he
was
said
to
be
of
armenian
parentage
on
his
mother
side
and
his
sincerity
as
a
moslem
was
suspected
it
seemed
impossible
one
born
in
abd
el
mejid
seraglio
should
be
a
serious
man
besides
he
had
not
yet
shown
his
strength
and
to
be
strong
is
to
be
a
hero
everywhere
but
within
the
last
eight
months
events
have
marched
rapidly
abd
el
hamid
has
played
his
cards
successfully
in
greece
in
albania
and
with
the
kurds
he
has
not
been
afraid
of
england
and
has
shown
a
bold
front
against
infidel
reforms
he
has
had
the
courage
under
the
eyes
of
europe
to
arrest
their
midhat
and
to
try
him
for
murder
lastly
the
french
have
played
into
his
hands
in
tunis
and
he
has
thus
gained
a
footing
of
sympathy
with
the
mussulmans
of
north
africa
a
population
which
has
for
centuries
opposed
his
claims
twenty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
for
an
ottoman
sultan
to
awaken
any
loyal
feeling
in
any
arab
breast
tunis
then
specially
boasted
her
independence
of
the
porte
and
all
but
the
hanefite
rulers
of
the
towns
of
africa
would
have
scouted
the
idea
of
fighting
for
the
turk
now
the
malekites
themselves
the
puritans
of
kerwan
are
moving
at
abd
el
hamid
nod
he
would
seem
too
to
be
stirring
with
some
success
in
egypt
and
indian
mussulmans
are
praying
for
him
publicly
in
their
mosques
everywhere
the
reactionary
party
is
standing
to
its
arms
and
is
beginning
to
recognize
a
leader
in
this
supple
armenian
khalifeh
who
is
defying
europe
and
seems
willing
if
necessary
to
lead
them
one
day
on
a
jehad
with
all
this
however
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
orthodox
islam
is
by
any
means
yet
won
back
to
constantinople
turkey
i
have
shown
and
the
hanefite
school
are
far
from
being
the
whole
of
the
mohammedan
world
and
side
by
side
with
the
fanatical
obduracy
of
the
ottoman
state
party
and
the
still
fiercer
puritanism
of
the
melkites
there
exists
an
intelligent
and
hopeful
party
favourable
to
religious
reform
shafite
egypt
is
its
stronghold
but
it
is
powerful
too
in
arabia
and
further
east
with
it
a
first
article
of
faith
is
that
the
house
of
othman
has
been
and
is
the
curse
of
islam
and
that
its
end
is
at
hand
in
spite
of
abd
el
hamid
pious
appeals
to
the
sheriat
they
look
upon
him
as
one
who
troubleth
islam
he
is
the
representative
of
the
party
most
bitterly
opposed
to
all
of
good
they
know
that
as
long
as
there
is
an
ottoman
caliph
whether
his
name
be
abd
el
aziz
or
abd
el
hamid
moral
progress
is
impossible
that
the
ijtahad
can
not
be
and
that
no
such
reformation
of
doctrine
and
practice
can
be
attempted
as
would
alone
enable
their
faith
to
cope
with
modern
infidelity
they
see
moreover
that
notwithstanding
his
affected
legality
abd
el
rule
is
neither
juster
nor
more
in
accordance
with
the
mussulman
law
than
that
of
his
predecessors
the
same
vices
of
administration
are
found
in
it
and
the
same
recklessness
for
his
mussulman
welfare
of
all
the
lands
of
islam
his
own
are
probably
those
where
abd
el
hamid
has
now
the
most
scanty
following
constantinople
is
after
all
his
weak
point
for
the
young
turkish
school
is
far
from
dead
the
vicissitudes
of
life
and
death
follow
each
other
closely
on
the
bosphorus
and
the
liberal
party
can
better
afford
than
the
reactionary
to
wait
the
death
or
fall
of
abd
el
hamid
whenever
it
may
happen
would
immediately
decide
a
movement

chapter
iii
the
true
metropolis
mecca
in
the
last
chapter
the
position
of
the
ottoman
sultans
towards
the
mass
of
orthodox
islam
was
sketched
and
the
foundations
were
shown
on
which
their
tenure
of
the
caliphal
title
rested
these
i
explained
to
be
neither
very
ancient
nor
very
securely
laid
in
the
faith
and
affections
of
the
faithful
and
though
at
the
present
moment
a
certain
reaction
in
favour
of
constantinople
had
set
in
it
was
due
to
accidental
circumstances
which
are
unlikely
to
become
permanent
and
was
very
far
indeed
from
being
universal
it
may
be
as
well
to
recapitulate
the
position
the
sunite
or
orthodox
mohammedan
world
holds
it
as
a
dogma
of
faith
that
there
must
be
a
khalifeh
the
head
of
their
religious
polity
and
the
successor
of
their
prophet
in
temporal
matters
whoever
holds
this
office
is
theoretically
king
of
all
islam
and
in
spiritual
matters
he
is
their
supreme
religious
authority
but
practically
the
caliph
temporal
jurisdiction
has
for
many
centuries
been
limited
to
such
lands
as
he
could
hold
by
arms
while
in
spiritual
matters
he
has
exercised
no
direct
authority
whatever
nevertheless
he
represents
to
mussulmans
something
of
which
they
are
in
need
and
which
they
are
bound
to
respect
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
proper
hands
and
at
the
proper
moment
the
caliphate
might
once
more
become
an
instrument
for
good
or
evil
of
almost
universal
power
in
islam
even
now
were
there
to
be
an
apprehension
of
general
and
overwhelming
danger
for
religion
it
is
to
the
caliph
that
the
faithful
would
look
to
defend
their
interests
and
as
we
have
seen
a
moderate
show
of
piety
and
respect
for
the
sacred
law
has
been
sufficient
in
spite
of
a
violent
political
opposition
to
secure
for
the
actual
holder
of
the
title
a
degree
of
sympathy
which
no
other
mussulman
prince
could
at
any
cost
of
good
government
have
obtained
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
shown
that
the
loyalty
such
as
there
is
which
abd
el
hamid
inspires
is
due
to
him
solely
as
incumbent
of
the
caliphal
office
and
not
as
the
representative
of
any
race
or
dynasty
the
house
of
othman
as
such
represents
nothing
sacred
to
mussulmans
and
the
turkish
race
is
very
far
from
being
respected
in
islam
the
present
caliphal
house
is
unconnected
in
blood
with
the
old
traditional
line
of
successors
and
even
with
the
turks
themselves
inspires
little
modern
reverence
moreover
the
actual
incumbent
of
the
office
is
thought
to
be
not
even
a
true
ottoman
being
the
offspring
of
the
seraglio
rather
than
of
known
parents
abd
el
hamid
sole
title
to
spiritual
consideration
is
his
official
name
this
he
has
had
the
sense
to
set
prominently
forward
reduced
to
a
syllogism
mussulman
loyalty
may
be
read
thus
there
must
be
a
caliph
and
the
caliphate
deserves
respect
there
is
no
other
caliph
but
abd
el
hamid
ergo
abd
el
hamid
deserves
respect
it
has
been
pointed
out
however
that
if
the
sultan
recent
revival
of
spiritual
pretensions
is
his
present
strength
it
may
also
in
the
immediate
future
become
his
weakness
the
challenge
which
the
constantinople
school
of
hanefism
threw
down
ten
years
ago
to
the
world
has
been
taken
up
and
all
the
learned
world
now
knows
the
frailty
of
the
house
of
othman
spiritual
position
the
true
history
of
the
caliphate
has
been
published
and
set
side
by
side
with
that
turkish
history
which
the
ignorance
of
a
previous
generation
had
come
to
confound
with
it
at
the
present
day
nobody
with
any
instruction
doubts
that
abd
el
hamid
and
his
house
might
be
legally
displaced
by
the
first
successful
rival
and
that
the
only
right
of
constantinople
to
lead
islam
is
the
right
of
the
sword
as
long
as
the
ottoman
empire
is
maintained
and
no
counter
caliph
appears
so
long
will
the
sultan
be
the
acknowledged
head
of
religion
but
not
a
day
longer
the
caliphate
for
one
alien
as
abd
el
hamid
is
to
the
koreysh
must
be
constantly
maintained
in
arms
and
on
the
first
substantial
success
of
a
new
pretender
his
present
following
would
fall
off
from
him
without
compunction
transferring
to
this
last
their
loyalty
on
precisely
the
same
ground
on
which
abd
el
hamid
now
receives
it
abd
el
hamid
would
then
be
legitimately
deposed
and
disappear
for
it
is
unlikely
that
he
would
find
any
such
protector
in
his
adversity
as
the
legitimate
caliphs
found
in
theirs
six
hundred
years
ago
so
fully
is
this
state
of
things
recognized
by
the
ulema
that
i
found
the
opinion
last
year
to
be
nearly
universal
that
abd
el
hamid
was
destined
to
be
the
last
caliph
of
the
house
of
othman
it
becomes
therefore
a
question
of
extreme
interest
to
consider
who
among
mussulman
princes
could
with
any
chance
of
being
generally
accepted
by
orthodox
islam
put
in
a
claim
to
replace
the
ottoman
dynasty
as
caliph
when
the
day
of
its
doom
shall
have
been
reached
it
is
a
question
which
ought
certainly
to
interest
englishmen
for
on
its
solution
the
whole
problem
of
mussulman
loyalty
or
revolt
in
india
most
probably
depends
and
though
it
would
certainly
be
unwise
at
the
present
moment
for
an
english
government
to
obtrude
itself
violently
in
a
religious
quarrel
not
yet
ripe
much
might
be
done
in
a
perfectly
legitimate
way
to
influence
the
natural
course
of
events
and
direct
it
to
a
channel
favourable
to
british
interests
is
there
then
in
islam
east
or
west
or
south
a
man
of
sufficient
eminence
and
courage
to
proclaim
himself
caliph
in
the
event
of
abd
el
hamid
political
collapse
or
death
what
would
be
his
line
of
action
to
secure
mahommedan
acceptance
where
should
he
fix
his
capital
and
on
what
arms
should
he
rely
whose
flag
should
he
display
above
all
for
this
is
the
question
that
interests
us
most
could
such
a
change
of
rulers
affect
favourably
the
future
thought
and
life
of
islam
and
lead
to
an
honest
moslem
reformation
these
questions
which
are
being
cautiously
asked
of
each
other
by
thoughtful
mussulmans
in
every
corner
of
the
east
i
now
propose
to
consider
and
as
far
as
it
is
in
my
power
to
answer
i
have
said
that
islam
is
already
well
prepared
for
change
whatever
europeans
may
think
of
a
future
for
the
ottoman
empire
mussulmans
are
profoundly
convinced
that
on
its
present
basis
it
will
not
long
survive
even
in
turkey
the
thought
of
its
political
regeneration
as
an
european
empire
has
been
at
last
abandoned
and
no
one
now
contemplates
more
than
a
few
years
further
tenure
of
the
bosphorus
twenty
years
ago
it
was
not
so
nor
perhaps
five
but
all
are
resigned
to
this
ancient
prophecy
and
modern
superstition
alike
point
to
a
return
of
the
crescent
into
asia
as
an
event
at
hand
and
to
the
doom
of
the
turks
as
a
race
which
has
corrupted
islam
a
prediction
to
this
effect
which
has
for
ages
exercised
its
influence
on
the
vulgar
and
even
the
learned
mohammedan
mind
gives
the
year
of
our
era
as
the
term
within
which
these
things
are
to
be
accomplished
and
places
the
scene
of
the
last
struggle
in
northern
syria
at
homs
on
the
orontes
islam
is
then
finally
to
retire
from
the
north
and
the
turkish
rule
to
cease
such
prophecies
often
work
their
own
fulfilment
and
the
feeling
of
a
coming
catastrophe
is
so
deeply
rooted
and
so
universal
that
i
question
whether
the
proclamation
of
a
jehad
by
the
sultan
would
now
induce
a
thousand
moslems
to
fight
voluntarily
against
the
cross
in
europe
the
sultan
himself
and
the
old
turkish
party
which
supports
him
while
clinging
obstinately
in
appearance
to
all
their
ground
really
have
their
eyes
turned
elsewhere
than
on
adrianople
and
salonica
and
the
city
of
the
roman
emperors
it
is
unlikely
that
a
new
advance
of
the
christian
powers
from
the
balkan
would
meet
again
with
more
than
formal
opposition
and
constantinople
itself
unsupported
by
european
aid
would
be
abandoned
without
a
blow
or
with
only
such
show
of
resistance
as
the
sheriat
requires
for
a
cession
of
territory
the
sultan
would
in
such
an
event
pass
into
asia
and
i
have
been
credibly
informed
that
his
own
plan
is
to
make
not
broussa
but
bagdad
or
damascus
his
capital
this
he
considers
would
be
more
in
conformity
with
caliphal
traditions
and
the
caliphate
would
gain
strength
by
a
return
to
its
old
centres
damascus
is
surnamed
by
theologians
el
gate
of
the
caaba
and
there
or
at
bagdad
the
traditional
city
of
the
caliphs
he
would
build
up
once
more
a
purely
theocratic
empire
such
they
say
is
his
thought
and
such
doubtless
would
be
the
empire
of
the
future
that
mussulmans
would
choose
only
it
is
improbable
that
it
would
continue
to
be
in
any
sense
ottoman
or
that
abd
el
hamid
would
have
the
opportunity
of
himself
establishing
it
the
loss
of
constantinople
would
be
a
blow
to
his
prestige
he
could
not
well
recover
from
and
no
new
empire
ever
yet
was
founded
on
defeat
what
is
far
more
likely
to
happen
is
that
in
such
an
event
abd
el
hamid
and
his
house
would
disappear
and
an
entirely
new
order
of
caliphal
succession
take
their
place
even
without
supposing
any
such
convulsion
to
the
empire
as
a
loss
of
the
bosphorus
his
reign
will
hardly
be
a
long
one
the
ulema
of
constantinople
are
by
no
means
all
on
his
side
and
the
party
of
young
turkey
cowed
for
the
moment
by
the
terrorism
which
there
prevails
is
his
bitter
enemy
and
will
not
let
him
rest
it
will
infallibly
on
the
next
danger
from
europe
show
its
head
again
and
take
its
revenge
it
is
said
to
be
the
programme
of
this
party
when
it
next
comes
to
power
to
separate
the
spiritual
functions
of
the
caliphate
from
those
of
the
head
of
the
state
copying
in
so
far
the
modern
practice
of
europe
towards
the
papacy
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
attempted
to
restore
that
state
of
things
which
as
we
have
already
seen
existed
at
cairo
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
and
it
is
just
conceivable
that
as
far
as
turkey
itself
was
concerned
such
an
arrangement
might
for
a
time
succeed
there
would
then
be
two
powers
at
constantinople
a
maire
du
palais
who
would
reign
and
a
caliph
who
would
be
head
of
religion
a
separation
of
offices
which
would
certainly
facilitate
the
sort
of
reform
that
midhat
and
his
friends
desire
but
to
the
world
at
large
the
event
would
only
signify
that
constantinople
had
formally
abdicated
her
claim
to
leadership
and
islam
would
never
acknowledge
as
caliph
the
mere
puppet
of
an
irreligious
clique
of
officials
because
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
beni
othman
his
political
power
is
the
only
thing
that
reconciles
islam
with
an
ottoman
caliph
and
without
sovereignty
he
would
be
discarded
in
whatever
way
therefore
that
we
look
at
it
there
seems
justification
in
probability
for
the
conviction
already
cited
that
after
abd
el
hamid
a
new
order
of
caliphal
succession
will
be
seen
it
seems
to
be
an
universal
opinion
at
the
present
day
among
those
who
think
at
all
upon
the
matter
that
whatever
change
may
be
impending
for
islam
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
concentration
rather
than
of
extension
all
parties
see
that
the
day
of
outside
conquest
is
at
an
end
and
that
the
utmost
that
islam
can
look
forward
to
politically
is
the
maintenance
of
its
present
positions
and
as
an
extreme
possibility
the
emancipation
of
its
lost
provinces
in
india
and
north
africa
from
christian
rule
there
is
therefore
a
conviction
that
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
supreme
authority
when
made
will
be
towards
the
centre
not
to
any
new
extremity
of
islam
constantinople
even
if
all
islam
were
combined
for
its
defence
is
felt
to
be
too
near
the
infidel
frontier
to
be
safe
and
cosmopolitan
city
as
it
has
become
it
is
by
many
looked
upon
itself
as
infidel
a
position
further
removed
from
danger
and
more
purely
mohammedan
is
the
necessity
of
the
day
and
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
when
the
time
comes
the
possession
of
some
such
vantage
ground
will
be
recognized
as
a
first
qualification
with
whoever
shall
assume
the
leadership
of
islam
we
have
seen
that
abd
el
hamid
dreams
of
damascus
or
bagdad
but
others
dream
of
cairo
as
the
new
seat
of
the
caliphate
and
to
the
majority
of
mussulmans
it
is
rapidly
becoming
apparent
that
the
retreat
once
begun
must
be
conducted
further
still
and
that
the
only
true
for
theocracy
is
in
arabia
its
birthplace
and
the
fountain
head
of
its
inspiration
there
alone
in
the
world
all
the
conditions
for
the
independent
exercise
of
religious
sovereignty
are
to
be
found
in
arabia
there
are
neither
christians
nor
jews
nor
infidels
of
any
sort
for
islam
to
count
with
nor
is
it
so
rich
a
possession
that
it
should
ever
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
western
powers
a
caliph
there
need
fear
no
admonition
from
frank
ambassadors
in
virtue
of
any
capitulations
he
would
be
free
to
act
as
the
successor
of
the
apostle
should
and
would
breathe
the
pure
air
of
an
unadulterated
islam
a
return
therefore
to
medina
or
mecca
is
the
probable
future
of
the
caliphate
the
importance
of
arabia
has
of
late
years
been
fully
recognized
both
at
constantinople
and
elsewhere
it
has
been
the
sustained
policy
of
abd
el
hamid
at
all
cost
and
by
whatsoever
means
to
maintain
his
influence
there
and
he
knows
that
without
it
his
spiritual
pretensions
could
have
no
secure
foundations
arabia
he
perceives
is
the
main
point
of
the
caliphal
problem
and
whether
or
not
the
future
holder
of
the
office
reside
in
hejaz
it
is
certain
that
by
its
tenure
alone
the
mohammedan
world
will
judge
of
his
right
to
be
their
leader
it
will
therefore
before
we
go
further
be
interesting
to
examine
the
relations
existing
in
the
past
and
present
between
mecca
and
the
caliphate
and
to
ascertain
the
position
now
held
by
abd
el
hamid
in
arabia
on
this
point
i
believe
that
i
can
offer
information
which
will
be
both
valuable
and
new
the
political
constitution
of
the
moslem
holy
land
is
one
of
the
most
anomalous
in
the
world
like
every
district
of
arabia
proper
hejaz
has
a
town
and
a
nomad
population
but
almost
no
intermediate
agricultural
class
the
townsmen
i
have
already
described
a
multitude
of
mixed
origin
descended
from
such
pilgrims
as
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
have
visited
the
holy
places
and
have
remained
to
marry
and
die
in
them
the
nomads
on
the
contrary
are
a
pure
race
of
a
peculiarly
noble
type
and
unchanged
in
any
essential
feature
of
their
life
from
what
they
were
in
the
days
of
mohammed
they
are
warlike
unquiet
bedouins
for
they
have
no
horses
and
armed
with
matchlocks
and
they
are
proud
of
their
independence
and
tenacious
of
their
rights
no
serious
attempt
has
ever
been
made
except
by
mehemet
ali
to
subdue
them
and
none
at
all
has
succeeded
unlike
the
generality
of
peninsular
bedouins
however
they
are
professed
sunite
mohammedans
if
not
of
a
very
pious
type
and
they
acknowledge
as
their
chief
the
head
of
their
most
noble
tribe
the
grand
sherif
of
the
koreysh
who
is
also
prince
of
mecca
the
koreysh
is
still
a
distinct
nomadic
tribe
inhabiting
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
mecca
not
numerous
but
not
in
decay
they
are
divided
into
several
sections
each
governed
by
its
sheykh
the
chief
of
which
the
abadleh
has
for
several
centuries
supplied
the
reigning
family
of
hejaz
this
last
traces
its
descent
from
ali
ibn
abutaleb
the
fourth
caliph
through
his
son
hassan
and
through
ali
wife
fatmeh
from
mohammed
himself
it
is
probably
the
oldest
authentic
male
descent
in
the
world
and
certainly
the
most
sacred
all
the
members
of
this
abadleh
family
enjoy
the
title
of
sherif
the
head
of
it
only
being
distinguished
as
the
sherif
el
kebir
the
great
or
grand
sherif
the
rest
of
the
koreysh
not
being
descended
from
fatmeh
do
not
receive
the
title
all
alike
wear
the
bedouin
dress
of
abba
and
kefiyeh
even
the
prince
himself
standing
in
this
strikingly
in
contrast
with
the
hejazi
citizens
who
affect
the
turban
and
gombaz
the
district
of
medina
is
occupied
by
the
harb
bedouins
a
larger
and
more
powerful
tribe
than
the
koreysh
who
also
recognize
the
sherif
but
their
allegiance
is
precarious
while
to
the
east
and
south
of
mecca
the
ateybeh
and
assir
more
powerful
still
are
wholly
independent
it
has
always
been
a
difficult
matter
to
keep
these
unruly
elements
at
peace
with
each
other
and
with
the
citizens
nor
could
the
sherif
hope
to
effect
it
were
he
not
himself
of
bedouin
and
noble
blood
the
early
history
of
the
sherifate
is
exceedingly
obscure
when
the
caliphs
definitely
abandoned
medina
as
their
capital
in
the
fortieth
year
of
islam
they
for
a
time
left
deputies
of
the
sherifal
family
behind
them
to
govern
in
their
name
and
as
long
as
the
ommiad
and
abbaside
dynasties
continued
at
damascus
and
bagdad
their
sovereignty
was
acknowledged
in
hejaz
but
on
the
destruction
of
the
arabian
caliphate
in
the
sherifal
family
seems
to
have
set
itself
up
independently
relying
only
on
the
casual
help
of
the
egyptian
sultans
and
the
imams
of
sana
to
protect
them
against
the
bedouins
of
nejd
and
assir
now
hardly
any
longer
even
in
name
mohammedans
the
egyptian
sultan
however
was
the
titular
protector
of
the
holy
places
and
it
was
he
who
transmitted
the
surrah
or
religious
contributions
made
by
the
faithful
and
provided
escort
for
the
yearly
pilgrimage
made
to
the
shrines
thus
we
read
of
kaïd
beg
having
rebuilt
the
mosque
of
medina
in
and
having
sent
a
yearly
subsidy
of
ardebs
of
corn
for
the
townspeople
other
princes
however
contributed
their
offerings
too
and
received
titles
of
honour
connected
with
the
holy
land
the
shahs
of
persia
the
moguls
and
the
ottomans
the
first
connection
of
the
latter
with
mecca
that
i
can
find
was
in
when
the
padishah
mohammed
khan
having
sent
a
surrah
or
bag
of
gold
to
the
sherif
to
be
distributed
in
alms
received
from
him
the
title
of
khaddam
el
harameyn
servant
of
the
two
shrines
and
the
gift
being
continued
annually
by
the
ottoman
padishahs
may
very
likely
have
paved
the
way
to
their
recognition
later
as
caliphs
it
would
seem
singular
at
first
sight
that
the
sherifs
being
themselves
of
the
sacred
family
whose
special
inheritance
the
caliphate
was
should
ever
thus
have
recognized
a
stranger
as
its
legal
heir
but
the
political
weakness
of
the
meccan
government
in
the
sixteenth
century
must
be
taken
into
account
as
the
reason
the
grand
sherif
could
hardly
have
stood
alone
as
an
independent
sovereign
for
he
was
continually
menaced
on
the
one
side
by
the
dissenting
omani
and
on
the
other
by
the
unbelieving
tribes
of
nejd
against
whom
his
frontier
was
defenceless
he
could
not
with
his
own
resources
protect
the
pilgrim
routes
from
plunder
and
on
the
pilgrimage
all
the
prosperity
of
hejaz
depended
it
therefore
was
a
necessity
with
the
meccans
to
have
a
protector
of
some
sort
and
sultan
kansaw
having
fallen
they
accepted
sultan
selim
the
ottoman
sultans
then
became
protectors
of
the
holy
places
and
were
acknowledged
caliphs
without
any
appeal
to
arms
at
mecca
and
medina
their
weapons
were
in
fact
the
gold
and
silver
pieces
with
which
they
subsidized
the
sherifs
sultan
selim
at
once
on
being
acknowledged
ordered
an
additional
annuity
of
ardebs
to
be
paid
to
mecca
and
he
and
his
immediate
successors
carried
out
at
their
own
expense
such
public
works
as
the
shrines
required
in
the
way
of
repairs
or
improvements
subsequently
the
seaport
of
jeddah
formerly
occupied
by
the
egyptians
received
a
turkish
contingent
but
the
interior
of
hejaz
was
never
subjugated
nor
was
any
tax
at
any
time
levied
only
once
a
year
an
ottoman
army
appeared
before
the
walls
of
medina
conducting
the
pilgrims
from
damascus
and
convoying
the
surrah
the
state
of
things
at
mecca
in
the
last
century
has
been
clearly
sketched
by
niebuhr
the
sherifs
were
in
reality
independent
princes
but
they
gratified
the
vanity
of
the
grand
signior
by
calling
him
their
suzerain
he
on
his
side
occasionally
exercising
the
right
of
power
by
deposing
the
reigning
sherif
and
appointing
another
of
the
same
family
no
kind
of
administration
had
then
been
attempted
by
the
turks
in
hejaz
mehemet
ali
occupation
of
hejaz
in
first
brought
foreign
troops
inland
he
established
himself
at
taïf
the
summer
residence
of
the
meccans
deposed
the
grand
sherif
ghaleb
and
appointed
in
his
stead
another
member
of
the
sherifal
family
declaring
the
sultan
sovereign
of
the
country
acts
which
the
meccans
acquiesced
in
through
dread
of
the
wahhabis
from
whom
mehemet
ali
promised
to
deliver
them
the
egyptian
and
turkish
governments
have
thus
during
the
present
century
exercised
some
of
the
functions
of
sovereignty
in
hejaz
at
the
present
moment
sultan
abd
el
hamid
position
in
the
country
is
this
his
troops
occupy
jeddah
and
yembo
the
two
seaports
and
the
towns
of
medina
and
taïf
in
the
interior
he
is
acknowledged
by
the
sherifs
as
sovereign
except
in
mecca
and
he
appoints
to
all
the
principal
offices
of
state
including
the
supreme
office
of
the
grand
sherifate
itself
he
is
represented
by
a
pasha
who
resides
alternately
at
jeddah
and
taïf
according
to
the
season
but
who
has
not
the
right
of
entering
mecca
without
the
grand
sherif
leave
or
of
sending
troops
there
the
total
garrison
of
the
turks
in
hejaz
last
winter
was
from
to
men
of
whom
only
were
regulars
nizams
and
efficient
while
i
was
at
jeddah
the
medina
garrison
of
regulars
having
been
long
unpaid
and
unrationed
was
said
to
be
living
on
public
charity
on
the
other
hand
the
hejazi
bedouins
do
not
acknowledge
any
sovereignty
but
that
of
the
sherif
nor
could
the
sultan
pretend
to
keep
order
outside
the
towns
except
through
the
sherif
interposition
the
sultan
levies
no
tax
in
the
interior
or
impost
of
any
kind
and
the
sole
revenue
he
receives
in
hejaz
comes
from
customs
duties
of
jeddah
and
yembo
which
may
amount
to
in
return
for
this
he
also
is
bound
to
transmit
every
year
at
the
time
of
the
pilgrimage
sums
of
money
collected
by
him
from
the
revenues
of
the
wakaf
within
his
dominions
lands
settled
by
pious
persons
on
the
sherifal
family
these
are
said
to
amount
to
nearly
half
a
million
sterling
and
are
distributed
amongst
all
the
principal
personages
of
hejaz
the
transmission
of
the
wakaf
income
in
which
the
sultan
constitutes
himself
so
to
say
the
sherif
agent
is
in
fact
the
real
bond
which
unites
hejaz
with
the
caliphate
and
its
distribution
gives
the
sultan
patronage
and
with
it
power
in
the
country
the
bond
however
is
one
of
interest
only
the
sherifs
proud
of
their
sacred
ancestry
look
upon
the
turkish
caliphs
as
barbarians
and
impostors
while
the
sultans
find
the
hejaz
a
heavy
charge
upon
their
revenue
either
hates
and
despises
the
other
the
patron
and
the
patronized
and
save
that
their
union
is
a
necessity
it
would
long
ago
have
by
mutual
consent
been
dissolved
the
sherif
depends
upon
the
sultan
because
he
needs
a
protector
and
needs
his
wakaf
the
sultan
depends
upon
the
sherif
because
recognition
by
hejaz
as
the
protector
is
a
chief
title
to
his
caliphate
mecca
in
fact
is
a
necessity
to
islam
even
more
than
a
caliph
and
whoever
is
sovereign
there
is
naturally
sovereign
of
the
mussulman
world
outside
hejaz
the
sultan
holds
what
he
holds
of
arabia
merely
by
force
i
have
described
already
the
growing
power
of
ibn
rashid
the
prince
of
nejd
and
since
that
time
two
years
ago
he
has
sensibly
extended
and
confirmed
his
influence
there
he
has
now
brought
into
his
alliance
all
the
important
tribes
of
northern
arabia
including
the
powerful
ateybeh
who
a
few
months
ago
were
threatening
mecca
and
in
hejaz
his
name
is
already
as
potent
as
the
sultan
he
offered
while
i
was
at
jeddah
to
undertake
the
whole
convoy
of
the
damascus
pilgrimage
with
his
own
troops
as
already
he
convoys
that
from
persia
while
i
have
quite
recent
information
of
a
campaign
against
his
own
rivals
the
ibn
saouds
which
he
has
just
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
in
yemen
the
other
neighbour
of
the
meccans
turkish
troops
are
required
to
garrison
the
few
towns
the
sultan
calls
his
own
and
were
it
not
for
the
facility
given
him
by
the
possession
of
the
these
could
not
long
hope
to
hold
their
ground
every
day
i
am
expecting
news
from
there
of
a
revolt
and
the
first
sign
of
weakness
at
constantinople
will
certainly
precipitate
a
war
of
independence
in
that
part
of
arabia
we
may
expect
therefore
in
the
event
of
such
a
as
i
have
suggested
to
be
likely
of
the
ottoman
power
either
through
loss
of
territory
or
by
the
growing
impoverishment
of
the
empire
which
needs
must
in
a
few
decades
end
in
atrophy
to
see
among
mussulman
princes
a
competition
for
the
right
of
protecting
the
holy
places
and
with
it
of
inheriting
the
caliphal
title
the
sultan
reduced
to
asia
minor
even
if
he
retain
armenia
and
kurdistan
which
is
extremely
improbable
would
be
quite
unable
to
afford
himself
the
expensive
luxury
of
holding
his
arabian
conquests
and
buying
the
patronage
of
mecca
he
would
be
unable
any
longer
to
overawe
the
red
sea
or
secure
the
pilgrim
routes
the
princes
of
nejd
would
certainly
not
tolerate
the
presence
of
turkish
soldiers
at
medina
and
the
sherifs
of
mecca
would
have
to
make
terms
with
them
and
with
the
restored
imams
of
yemen
till
such
time
as
they
should
find
a
new
protector
elsewhere
above
all
the
half
million
of
wakaf
income
would
no
longer
be
forthcoming
and
a
turkish
emir
el
haj
arriving
at
mecca
would
bring
his
master
to
a
climax
of
derision
hejaz
then
would
infallibly
look
out
for
a
new
potentate
whom
she
could
dignify
with
the
title
of
hami
el
harameyn
and
emir
el
mumenin
and
if
there
were
none
forthcoming
would
herself
proclaim
a
caliphate
let
us
look
therefore
at
the
lands
of
islam
to
see
in
which
of
them
a
competent
prince
of
the
faithful
is
likely
to
appear
it
is
possible
though
to
european
eyes
it
will
seem
far
from
probable
that
out
of
the
ferment
which
we
are
now
witnessing
in
the
barbary
states
some
leader
of
real
power
and
religious
distinction
may
arise
who
shall
possess
the
talent
of
banding
together
into
an
instrument
of
power
the
immense
but
scattered
forces
of
islam
in
northern
africa
and
after
achieving
some
signal
success
against
the
new
french
policy
establish
himself
in
tripoli
or
tunis
in
independent
sovereignty
were
such
another
man
as
abd
el
kader
to
arise
a
saint
a
preacher
and
a
soldier
indifferent
to
the
petty
aims
of
local
power
and
gifted
with
military
genius
true
piety
and
an
eloquent
tongue
i
believe
at
the
present
day
he
might
achieve
at
least
a
partial
success
the
french
army
is
weak
in
discipline
and
confidence
compared
to
what
it
was
in
abd
el
kader
day
and
it
has
a
far
more
difficult
frontier
to
defend
while
the
government
at
home
is
but
half
resolute
and
the
arabs
command
much
floating
sympathy
in
europe
and
elsewhere
i
do
not
say
the
thing
is
likely
but
it
is
conceivable
and
africa
contains
the
elements
of
a
possible
new
sovereignty
for
some
mussulman
prince
which
might
eventually
lead
him
on
the
road
to
mecca
it
is
undoubted
that
with
the
prestige
of
success
against
a
christian
power
and
backed
by
the
vast
populations
of
soudan
and
the
fierce
military
fervour
of
the
malekite
arabs
an
abd
el
kader
or
an
would
attract
the
sympathy
of
islam
and
might
aspire
to
its
highest
dignity
but
enormous
postulates
must
be
granted
before
we
can
look
on
any
one
now
known
to
fame
in
africa
as
a
probable
candidate
for
the
future
caliphate
the
present
leaders
of
the
arabs
are
but
local
heroes
and
as
yet
they
have
achieved
nothing
which
can
command
respect
in
tripoli
there
is
indeed
a
saint
of
very
high
pretensions
one
known
as
the
sheykh
es
snusi
who
has
a
large
religious
following
and
who
has
promised
to
come
forward
shortly
as
the
móhdy
or
guide
expected
by
a
large
section
of
the
sunite
as
well
as
the
shiite
mussulmans
next
year
he
will
attain
the
age
of
forty
the
legal
age
of
a
prophet
and
he
may
be
expected
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
any
general
movement
that
may
then
be
on
foot
but
as
yet
we
know
nothing
of
him
but
his
name
and
the
fact
of
his
sanctity
which
is
of
wahhabite
type
moreover
even
supposing
all
that
may
be
supposed
of
a
possible
success
there
yet
lies
egypt
and
the
suez
canal
between
the
barbary
state
and
mecca
so
that
i
think
we
may
be
justified
in
these
days
of
steam
fleets
and
electric
cables
and
european
concerts
if
we
treat
north
western
africa
as
out
of
probable
calculations
in
considering
the
future
of
the
caliphate
it
is
remarkable
that
the
sultan
of
morocco
has
taken
as
yet
no
apparent
part
in
the
religious
movement
of
modern
barbary
the
mussulman
princes
of
india
hold
a
very
similar
position
opposed
as
they
soon
may
be
indeed
must
be
if
the
unintelligent
english
policy
of
the
last
twenty
years
be
persevered
in
to
an
european
government
in
arms
they
will
have
the
chance
of
making
themselves
a
leading
position
in
the
eyes
of
islam
and
should
a
mohammedan
empire
arise
once
more
at
delhi
or
hyderabad
india
would
certainly
become
the
dar
el
islam
it
would
then
be
by
far
the
richest
and
most
populous
of
mohammedan
states
and
able
to
outbid
any
other
with
the
surrah
it
could
send
to
mecca
the
wakaf
property
in
india
at
the
present
day
is
supposed
to
be
as
valuable
as
that
in
the
ottoman
empire
and
it
would
then
become
a
source
of
patronage
with
the
government
instead
of
being
privately
remitted
as
now
if
money
alone
could
buy
the
caliphate
a
successful
leader
of
revolt
against
the
english
in
india
might
dictate
his
terms
to
islam
but
again
the
insuperable
obstacle
intervenes
of
distance
and
the
sea
mussulman
india
could
never
give
that
protection
to
mecca
that
islam
needs
and
could
not
assert
its
sovereignty
anywhere
but
at
home
in
arms
even
this
is
assuming
as
in
the
case
of
barbary
an
enormous
postulate
success
neither
india
then
nor
western
africa
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
supply
that
substitute
for
the
house
of
othman
which
we
need
a
more
apparent
and
in
the
opinion
of
some
a
likely
candidate
for
the
caliphate
succession
may
be
looked
for
in
the
viceregal
family
of
egypt
mohammed
towfik
if
he
were
a
man
of
genius
like
his
grandfather
or
if
honest
man
as
he
is
he
plays
his
cards
with
success
might
in
a
few
years
become
an
important
rival
at
mecca
to
the
sultan
to
say
nothing
of
its
traditional
connection
with
the
caliphate
egypt
has
the
more
modern
recollection
of
mehemet
ali
to
urge
upon
the
hejazi
in
its
favour
as
the
protecting
state
of
islam
mehemet
ali
name
and
that
of
his
successor
ibrahim
pasha
if
not
precisely
popular
are
at
least
respected
at
mecca
and
the
latter
possesses
a
great
title
to
sunite
gratitude
in
having
destroyed
the
wahhabite
empire
in
i
have
mentioned
mehemet
ali
ambition
and
a
similar
ambition
would
seem
to
have
occurred
to
ismaïl
the
late
khedive
he
in
the
plenitude
of
his
financial
power
is
stated
to
have
expended
large
sums
of
money
in
subsidising
the
sherifs
with
a
view
to
possible
contingencies
at
constantinople
but
unfortunately
for
him
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
on
which
he
had
counted
for
securing
him
the
support
of
europe
proved
the
precise
instrument
of
ruin
for
his
scheme
the
porte
in
scenting
danger
to
its
own
caliphal
pretensions
from
this
quarter
occupied
the
red
sea
in
force
reinforced
its
garrisons
in
jeddah
and
yembo
advanced
to
taïf
and
threw
a
large
army
into
yemen
this
was
alone
made
possible
by
the
canal
and
ismaïl
to
his
chagrin
found
himself
hoist
with
his
own
petard
mohammed
towfik
therefore
would
have
some
excuse
in
family
tradition
if
he
indulged
occasionally
in
dreams
of
a
similar
nature
his
connection
with
mecca
is
at
the
present
day
second
only
to
that
of
constantinople
the
egyptian
khedivieh
line
of
steamers
ply
constantly
between
suez
and
jeddah
and
the
haj
the
khedive
sends
to
mecca
including
as
it
does
most
of
the
mogrebbin
pilgrims
is
more
numerous
than
the
sultan
he
maintains
intimate
relations
with
one
at
least
of
the
great
sherifal
families
and
sends
a
mahmal
yearly
with
an
important
surrah
to
medina
mohammed
towfik
also
has
the
deserved
reputation
of
being
a
sincere
mussulman
and
an
honest
man
and
it
is
certain
that
a
large
section
of
true
liberal
opinion
looks
to
him
as
the
worthiest
supporter
of
its
views
with
all
this
i
doubt
if
he
be
big
enough
a
man
to
aspire
as
yet
with
success
to
abd
el
hamid
succession
the
present
viceroy
financial
position
though
we
may
hope
sounder
in
its
base
is
not
so
immediately
powerful
as
his
father
and
much
ready
money
will
be
required
by
an
aspirant
to
the
caliphate
his
fighting
power
too
is
small
and
he
would
have
to
proclaim
himself
in
arms
moreover
and
this
i
fear
will
remain
an
insuperable
difficulty
he
is
hampered
with
the
control
of
europe
islam
would
hardly
obey
another
caliph
who
was
himself
obedient
to
christendom
and
the
same
causes
which
have
ruined
the
house
of
othman
would
also
ruin
him
a
caliph
as
things
stand
can
not
legally
govern
except
by
the
old
canon
law
of
the
sheriat
and
though
a
lapsus
from
strict
observance
may
be
tolerated
in
an
ordinary
prince
or
even
in
a
well
established
caliph
a
new
caliph
putting
forward
a
new
claim
would
be
more
strictly
bound
how
could
mohammed
towfik
necessity
to
islam
be
reconciled
to
his
necessity
to
europe
between
the
two
stools
he
hardly
could
avert
a
fall
unless
then
some
unexpected
religious
hero
should
appear
in
eastern
asia
of
which
as
yet
there
is
no
sign
we
are
driven
to
arabia
for
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
where
to
establish
a
mussulman
theocracy
and
to
the
sherifal
family
of
mecca
itself
for
a
new
dynasty
the
family
of
the
sherifs
has
this
vast
advantage
over
any
other
possible
competitor
to
the
supreme
title
of
islam
that
it
is
of
the
acknowledged
blood
of
that
tribe
of
koreysh
which
mohammed
himself
designated
as
his
heirs
amongst
many
other
passages
of
authority
which
bear
upon
the
rights
of
the
koreysh
the
following
seem
to
me
the
most
explicit
and
the
best
worth
quoting
the
prophet
says
a
tradition
of
omm
hani
daughter
of
abutaleb
exalted
the
koreysh
by
conferring
on
them
seven
prerogatives
the
first
the
the
fact
that
they
had
given
birth
to
a
prophet
the
second
the
the
succession
the
third
the
the
guardianship
of
the
kaaba
the
fourth
the
the
right
of
supplying
water
to
the
haj
the
fifth
the
the
right
of
entertaining
the
haj
the
sixth
the
the
right
of
counsel
government
and
the
seventh
the
possession
of
the
banner
with
the
right
of
proclaiming
war
the
prophet
also
according
to
another
tradition
said
as
long
as
there
remains
one
man
of
the
koreysh
so
long
shall
that
man
be
my
successor
and
as
to
the
arab
race
if
the
arab
race
falls
islam
shall
fall
all
the
world
knows
these
things
and
to
the
popular
mind
especially
the
sherif
is
already
far
more
truly
the
representative
of
spiritual
rank
than
any
sultan
or
caliph
is
the
vast
populations
of
southern
and
eastern
asia
send
out
their
pilgrims
not
to
constantinople
but
to
mecca
and
it
is
the
sherif
whom
they
find
there
supreme
the
turkish
government
in
hejaz
holds
a
comparatively
insignificant
position
and
the
sultan
representative
at
jeddah
is
hardly
more
than
servant
to
the
prince
of
mecca
it
is
he
who
is
the
descendant
of
their
prophet
not
the
other
and
though
the
learned
may
make
distinctions
in
favour
of
the
caliph
the
haj
only
hears
of
the
sherif
even
at
constantinople
by
immemorial
custom
the
sultan
rises
to
receive
members
of
the
sacred
family
and
at
mecca
it
is
commonly
said
that
should
a
sultan
make
the
haj
in
person
he
would
be
received
by
the
grand
sherif
as
an
inferior
the
sherifal
family
then
is
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
religious
prestige
which
would
make
their
acquisition
of
the
supreme
temporal
title
appear
natural
to
all
but
the
races
who
have
been
in
subjection
to
the
ottomans
and
were
a
man
of
real
ability
to
appear
amongst
them
he
would
in
the
crisis
we
have
foreseen
be
sure
to
find
an
almost
universal
following
that
the
ottoman
government
is
perfectly
aware
of
this
is
certain
even
in
the
days
of
its
greatest
power
it
always
showed
its
jealousy
and
distrust
of
mecca
and
was
careful
when
any
of
the
grand
sherifs
acquired
what
was
considered
dangerous
influence
to
supplant
him
by
setting
up
a
rival
its
physical
power
enabled
it
to
do
this
and
though
it
could
not
abolish
the
office
of
the
grand
sherifate
it
could
interfere
in
the
order
of
succession
family
feuds
have
therefore
been
at
all
times
fostered
by
the
turks
in
hejaz
and
will
be
as
long
as
their
presence
there
is
tolerated
an
excellent
example
of
their
system
has
recently
been
given
in
the
episode
of
the
late
grand
sherif
death
and
the
story
of
it
will
serve
also
to
show
the
fear
entertained
by
the
present
sultan
of
this
his
great
spiritual
rival
to
tell
it
properly
i
must
go
back
to
the
epoch
of
the
wahhabite
invasion
of
hejaz
in
at
that
time
and
for
the
latter
half
of
the
previous
century
the
supreme
dignity
of
the
sherifal
house
was
held
by
a
branch
of
it
known
as
the
dewy
zeyd
the
word
is
used
in
hejaz
as
are
elsewhere
or
meaning
which
had
replaced
in
the
barakat
branch
mentioned
by
niebuhr
as
in
his
day
supreme
the
actual
holder
of
the
title
was
ghaleb
ibn
mesaad
and
he
finding
himself
unable
to
contend
against
the
wahhabis
became
himself
a
wahhabi
consequently
when
mehemet
ali
appeared
at
mecca
in
his
first
act
was
to
depose
this
ghaleb
in
spite
of
his
protest
that
he
had
returned
to
orthodoxy
and
to
appoint
another
member
of
the
sherifal
house
in
his
place
the
sherif
chosen
was
yahia
ibn
serur
of
a
rival
branch
the
dewy
aoun
and
a
bitter
animosity
was
by
this
means
engendered
between
the
two
families
of
aoun
and
zeyd
which
is
continued
to
the
present
day
nor
as
may
be
supposed
was
this
lessened
by
the
subsequent
changes
rung
by
the
turkish
and
egyptian
governments
in
their
appointments
to
the
office
for
in
we
find
abd
el
mutalleb
the
son
of
the
deposed
wahhabite
ghaleb
reappointed
and
in
the
following
year
again
mohammed
the
son
of
yahia
ibn
aoun
an
intrigue
which
brought
on
a
civil
war
then
in
a
new
intrigue
reinstated
abd
el
mutalleb
and
the
zeyds
and
then
in
these
were
again
deposed
for
rebellion
and
an
aoun
was
placed
in
power
from
till
the
aouns
retained
the
grand
sherifate
and
were
supreme
in
hejaz
coming
into
power
at
a
time
when
liberal
ideas
were
in
the
ascendant
they
have
consistently
been
liberal
and
still
represent
the
more
humane
and
progressive
party
among
the
meccans
in
the
desert
where
all
are
latitudinarian
they
are
the
popular
party
and
though
themselves
beyond
a
suspicion
of
unorthodoxy
they
have
always
shown
a
tolerant
spirit
towards
the
shiahs
and
other
heretics
with
whom
the
sherifal
authority
necessarily
comes
in
contact
every
year
at
the
haj
they
have
even
maintained
friendly
terms
with
the
european
element
at
jeddah
and
as
long
as
they
remained
in
power
the
relations
between
india
and
mecca
were
of
an
amicable
nature
abdallah
ibn
aoun
the
son
of
mohammed
who
succeeded
his
father
in
and
reigned
for
nineteen
years
was
a
man
of
considerable
ability
and
he
is
credited
with
having
had
views
of
so
advanced
a
nature
as
to
include
the
opening
of
hejaz
to
european
trade
nor
was
his
brother
who
in
became
grand
sherif
of
a
less
liberal
mind
though
of
less
ability
than
abdallah
he
is
described
as
eminently
humane
and
virtuous
and
it
is
certain
that
with
the
exception
of
his
hereditary
enemies
the
zeyds
he
was
universally
beloved
by
the
hejazi
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
in
the
year
following
the
disastrous
russian
war
when
constantinople
seemed
on
the
point
of
dissolution
the
arabs
began
to
talk
openly
of
making
el
husseyn
ibn
aoun
caliph
in
the
sultan
place
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
that
el
husseyn
himself
indulged
the
ambitious
project
of
his
friends
for
he
was
eminently
a
man
of
peace
and
the
caliphal
title
would
hardly
have
given
him
a
higher
position
than
he
held
but
it
is
certain
that
his
popularity
gave
umbrage
at
constantinople
the
more
so
as
abd
el
hamid
could
not
and
dared
not
depose
him
el
husseyn
too
became
specially
obnoxious
to
the
reactionary
party
when
it
resolved
at
last
to
quarrel
with
england
for
he
and
his
family
persisted
in
remaining
on
friendly
terms
with
the
british
government
on
all
occasions
when
the
interests
of
indian
subjects
of
her
majesty
came
in
question
at
the
haj
for
this
reason
principally
it
would
seem
his
death
was
resolved
on
to
make
room
for
the
agent
of
a
new
policy
on
the
of
march
jeddah
was
the
scene
of
a
solemn
pageant
the
haj
was
just
over
and
the
seaport
of
mecca
crowded
with
pilgrims
was
waiting
for
the
grand
sherif
the
descendant
of
the
prophet
and
the
representative
of
the
sacred
house
of
ali
to
give
the
blessing
of
his
presence
to
the
last
departing
votaries
travelling
by
night
from
mecca
el
husseyn
and
his
retinue
appeared
at
dawn
outside
the
city
walls
and
when
it
was
morning
mounted
on
a
white
mare
from
nejd
and
preceded
by
his
escort
of
koreysh
arabs
and
the
sultan
guard
of
honour
he
rode
into
the
town
the
streets
of
jeddah
are
narrow
and
tortuous
and
the
way
from
the
gate
to
the
house
of
omar
nassif
his
agent
where
he
was
accustomed
to
alight
was
thronged
with
pious
folk
who
struggled
for
the
privilege
of
kissing
his
feet
and
the
hem
of
his
arab
cloak
he
had
nearly
reached
the
place
when
an
old
beggar
from
the
crowd
pushed
his
way
forward
asking
loudly
for
alms
in
the
name
of
god
it
was
an
appeal
not
to
be
denied
and
as
the
sherif
turned
to
those
near
him
to
order
a
contribution
from
the
bag
kept
for
such
distributions
the
old
man
rose
upon
him
and
drawing
a
ragged
knife
so
it
was
described
to
me
struck
him
in
the
belly
at
first
even
those
who
saw
the
deed
hardly
knew
what
had
happened
for
el
husseyn
did
not
fall
or
dismount
and
without
speaking
rode
on
to
the
house
there
he
was
lifted
from
his
mare
and
carried
to
an
upper
chamber
and
in
the
course
of
some
hours
he
expired
those
nearest
him
meanwhile
had
seized
and
cudgelled
the
old
man
and
some
of
the
escort
had
taken
him
to
the
when
it
became
known
what
had
happened
a
great
cry
arose
in
jeddah
and
old
and
young
and
women
and
children
and
citizens
and
strangers
wept
together
i
have
heard
the
scene
described
as
one
beyond
description
moving
and
the
women
shrieked
and
wailed
the
whole
night
long
el
husseyn
was
beloved
and
he
was
taken
in
the
flower
of
his
manhood
no
satisfactory
judicial
investigation
seems
to
have
been
made
of
the
deed
though
a
formal
mejlis
was
held
at
mecca
whither
the
assassin
was
immediately
transferred
and
on
the
fourth
day
he
was
publicly
executed
who
and
what
he
was
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
turkish
bulletin
on
the
event
described
him
as
a
persian
fanatic
but
no
one
confessed
to
having
known
him
and
those
who
saw
and
spoke
to
him
while
in
custody
maintain
that
he
was
an
afghan
and
a
sunite
he
seems
to
have
given
contradictory
accounts
of
himself
but
the
general
impression
remains
that
he
came
from
turkey
and
was
by
profession
a
dervish
he
had
not
come
with
the
haj
but
had
been
first
noticed
as
a
beggar
at
mecca
ten
days
before
when
he
had
asked
and
received
an
alms
of
the
sherif
and
had
since
been
several
times
found
obtrusively
in
el
husseyn
path
no
one
at
jeddah
holds
the
turkish
governor
to
have
been
cognisant
of
the
crime
he
was
personally
on
good
terms
with
el
husseyn
and
has
since
been
disgraced
but
all
point
to
the
stamboul
camarilla
and
even
the
sultan
himself
as
its
author
it
is
known
that
abd
el
hamid
constantly
employs
dervishes
as
his
spies
and
private
agents
and
some
who
pretend
to
know
best
affirm
that
the
old
man
received
his
mission
directly
from
the
caliph
i
do
not
affect
to
decide
upon
the
point
but
think
the
to
lie
with
those
who
would
deny
it
assassination
of
a
dangerous
rival
or
of
too
powerful
a
chieftain
has
been
the
resource
time
out
of
mind
of
the
ottoman
sovereigns
and
they
can
hardly
claim
indulgence
now
from
public
opinion
the
sheykh
of
the
dervishes
is
all
powerful
with
his
fanatical
followers
and
he
is
the
sultan
servant
a
word
from
him
would
doubtless
have
secured
the
services
of
twenty
such
devotees
one
circumstance
points
decidedly
to
constantinople
it
is
known
in
jeddah
that
el
husseyn
successor
who
had
long
been
resident
at
constantinople
sent
orders
to
his
agent
at
jeddah
to
prepare
for
his
return
as
grand
sherif
two
months
before
el
husseyn
who
was
a
young
man
died
and
that
he
had
moreover
dispatched
most
of
his
baggage
in
anticipation
the
last
words
of
the
old
assassin
are
curious
having
done
his
deed
he
seemed
quite
happy
and
neither
ate
nor
drank
but
prepared
for
the
next
world
a
little
while
before
he
was
executed
he
related
a
story
there
was
once
he
said
an
elephant
a
great
and
noble
beast
and
to
him
god
sent
a
gnat
the
smallest
thing
which
is
it
stung
him
on
the
trunk
and
the
elephant
died
allah
kerim
god
is
merciful
el
husseyn
successor
the
man
for
whom
room
was
made
and
who
knew
beforehand
that
it
was
to
be
made
was
none
other
than
the
aged
and
twice
deposed
abd
el
mutalleb
the
son
of
the
wahhabite
ghaleb
the
fiercest
fanatic
of
the
dewy
zeyd
i
have
not
room
here
to
describe
in
detail
the
effect
of
this
coup
de
jarnac
on
the
political
aspect
of
hejaz
for
the
moment
the
reactionary
party
is
in
power
at
mecca
as
it
is
at
constantinople
abd
el
mutalleb
is
supported
by
turkish
bayonets
and
the
aoun
family
and
the
liberals
are
suffering
persecution
at
mecca
while
the
sherifal
court
which
had
hitherto
been
most
friendly
to
england
has
become
the
focus
of
indian
discontent
outside
the
town
all
is
disorder
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
if
i
have
shown
that
there
is
in
hejaz
an
element
of
spiritual
power
already
existing
side
by
side
with
the
sultan
of
which
advantage
may
one
day
be
taken
to
provide
him
with
a
natural
successor
if
no
new
figure
should
appear
on
the
political
horizon
of
islam
when
the
ottoman
empire
dies
sufficiently
commanding
to
attract
the
allegiance
of
the
mussulman
world
and
of
such
there
is
as
yet
no
sign
it
is
certainly
to
the
sherifal
family
of
mecca
that
the
mass
of
mohammedans
would
look
for
a
representative
of
their
supreme
headship
and
of
that
caliphate
of
which
they
stand
in
need
the
transfer
of
the
seat
of
spiritual
power
from
constantinople
to
mecca
would
be
an
easy
and
natural
one
and
would
hardly
disturb
the
existing
ideas
of
the
vulgar
while
it
would
harmonize
with
all
the
traditions
of
the
learned
mecca
or
medina
would
on
the
extinction
of
constantinople
become
almost
of
necessity
the
legal
home
of
the
ahl
el
agde
and
might
easily
become
the
acknowledged
centre
of
spiritual
power
all
whom
i
have
spoken
to
on
the
subject
agree
that
the
solution
would
be
an
acceptable
one
to
every
school
of
ulema
except
the
distinctly
turkish
schools
indeed
mecca
the
seat
of
the
caliphate
is
as
far
as
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
judging
the
cry
of
the
day
with
mussulmans
nor
is
it
one
likely
to
lose
strength
in
the
future
like
the
cry
of
roma
capitale
it
seems
to
exercise
a
strong
influence
on
the
imagination
of
all
to
whom
it
is
suggested
and
when
to
that
is
added
a
caliphate
from
the
koreysh
the
idea
is
to
arabs
at
least
irresistible
how
indeed
should
it
be
otherwise
when
we
look
back
on
history
for
my
own
part
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
determine
the
course
events
will
take
i
consider
this
notion
of
a
return
to
mecca
decidedly
the
most
probable
of
all
the
contingencies
we
have
reviewed
and
the
one
which
gives
the
best
promise
of
renewed
spiritual
life
for
islam
politically
the
caliph
at
mecca
would
of
course
be
less
important
than
now
on
the
bosphorus
but
religiously
he
would
have
a
far
more
assured
footing
every
year
the
pilgrimage
from
every
part
of
the
world
would
visit
him
and
instead
of
representing
a
mere
provincial
school
of
thought
he
would
then
be
a
true
metropolitan
for
all
schools
and
all
nations
the
arabian
element
in
islam
would
certainly
support
such
a
nomination
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
arabia
extends
from
marocco
to
bushire
and
so
would
the
indian
and
the
malay
indeed
every
element
but
the
turkish
which
is
day
by
day
becoming
of
less
importance
i
have
even
heard
it
affirmed
that
a
caliphate
of
the
koreysh
at
mecca
would
go
far
towards
reconciling
the
schismatics
abadhites
and
shiahs
with
orthodoxy
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
so
affect
the
liberal
of
wahhabism
to
the
shiahs
especially
a
descendant
of
ali
could
not
but
be
acceptable
and
to
the
arabs
of
oman
and
yemen
a
caliph
of
the
koreysh
would
be
at
least
less
repugnant
than
a
caliph
of
the
beni
othman
there
certainly
have
of
late
years
been
symptoms
of
less
bitterness
between
these
schismatics
and
their
old
enemies
the
sunites
and
such
a
change
in
the
conditions
of
the
caliphate
might
conceivably
bring
about
a
full
reconciliation
of
all
parties
mussulmans
can
no
longer
afford
to
fight
each
other
as
of
old
and
i
know
that
a
reunion
of
the
sects
is
already
an
idea
with
advanced
thinkers
lastly
the
caliphate
would
in
arabia
be
freed
from
the
incubus
of
turkish
scholasticism
and
the
stigma
of
turkish
immorality
and
would
have
freer
scope
for
what
islam
most
of
all
requires
a
moral
reformation
it
is
surely
not
beyond
the
flight
of
sane
imagination
to
suppose
in
the
last
overwhelming
catastrophe
of
constantinople
a
council
of
ulema
assembling
at
mecca
and
according
to
the
legal
precedent
of
ancient
days
electing
a
caliph
the
assembly
would
without
doubt
witness
intrigues
of
princes
and
quarrels
among
schoolmen
and
appeals
to
fanaticism
and
accusations
of
infidelity
money
too
would
certainly
play
its
part
there
as
elsewhere
and
perhaps
blood
might
be
shed
but
any
one
who
remembers
the
history
of
the
christian
church
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
synods
which
preceded
the
council
of
basle
must
admit
that
such
accompaniments
of
intrigue
and
corruption
are
no
bar
to
a
legal
solution
of
religious
difficulties
it
was
above
all
else
the
rivalries
of
popes
and
that
precipitated
the
catholic
reformation
footnotes
according
to
canon
law
the
caliph
can
not
cede
any
portion
of
the
lands
of
islam
except
on
physical
compulsion
this
too
was
written
before
the
events
of
september
these
have
immensely
added
to
the
chance
of
cairo
becoming
once
more
the
seat
of
the
caliphate
though
not
perhaps
of
mohammed
towfik
being
the
caliph
elected
chapter
iv
a
mohammedan
reformation
it
is
with
considerable
doubt
of
my
ability
to
do
justice
to
so
very
difficult
a
subject
that
i
now
approach
the
most
important
point
of
all
in
this
inquiry
namely
the
question
on
which
in
reality
every
other
depends
is
there
a
possibility
of
anything
like
general
reform
for
islam
in
her
political
and
moral
life
it
is
obvious
that
unless
we
can
answer
this
in
the
affirmative
none
of
the
changes
i
have
been
prefiguring
will
very
much
affect
her
ultimate
fortunes
neither
the
solution
of
her
legal
deadlock
with
the
ottoman
caliphate
nor
the
transfer
of
her
metropolis
to
a
new
centre
nor
even
the
triumph
of
her
arms
if
such
were
possible
in
africa
or
india
these
by
themselves
could
at
best
only
delay
her
decline
they
might
even
precipitate
her
ruin
islam
if
she
relies
only
on
the
sword
must
in
the
end
perish
by
it
for
her
forces
vast
as
they
are
are
without
physical
cohesion
being
scattered
widely
over
the
surface
of
three
continents
and
divided
by
insuperable
accidents
of
seas
and
deserts
and
the
enemy
she
would
have
to
face
is
intelligent
as
well
as
strong
and
would
not
let
her
rest
already
what
is
called
the
progress
of
the
world
envelopes
her
with
its
ships
and
its
commerce
and
above
all
with
its
printed
thought
which
she
is
beginning
to
read
nor
is
it
likely
in
the
future
to
affect
her
less
every
year
as
it
goes
by
carries
her
farther
from
the
possibility
of
isolation
and
forces
on
her
new
acquaintances
not
only
her
old
foes
the
frank
and
muscovite
but
the
german
the
chinaman
and
the
american
with
all
of
whom
she
may
have
in
turn
to
count
if
she
would
not
be
strangled
by
these
influences
she
must
use
other
arms
than
those
of
the
flesh
and
meet
the
intellectual
invasion
of
her
frontiers
with
a
corresponding
intelligence
otherwise
she
has
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
a
gradual
decay
spiritual
as
well
as
political
her
law
must
become
little
by
little
a
dead
letter
her
caliphate
an
obsolete
survival
and
her
creed
a
mere
opinion
islam
as
a
living
and
controlling
moral
force
in
the
world
would
then
gradually
cease
in
expressing
my
conviction
that
islam
is
not
thus
destined
yet
awhile
to
perish
i
believe
that
i
am
running
counter
to
much
high
authority
among
my
countrymen
i
know
that
it
is
a
received
opinion
with
those
best
qualified
to
instruct
the
public
that
islam
is
in
its
constitution
unamenable
to
change
and
by
consequence
to
progressive
life
or
even
in
the
face
of
hostile
elements
to
prolonged
life
at
all
students
of
the
sheriat
have
not
inaptly
compared
the
koranic
law
to
a
dead
hand
rigid
and
cold
and
only
to
be
loosened
when
the
hand
itself
shall
have
been
cut
away
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
first
rule
of
mohammedan
thought
has
been
that
change
was
inadmissible
and
development
of
religious
practice
either
to
right
or
left
of
the
narrow
path
of
mediæval
scholasticism
absolutely
precluded
i
know
this
and
i
know
too
that
a
vast
array
of
learned
mohammedan
opinion
can
be
cited
to
prove
this
to
be
the
case
and
that
very
few
of
the
modern
ulema
of
any
school
of
divinity
would
venture
openly
to
impugn
its
truth
nor
have
i
forgotten
the
repeated
failure
of
attempts
made
in
turkey
within
the
last
fifty
years
to
gain
religious
assent
to
the
various
legal
innovations
decreed
by
sultan
after
sultan
in
deference
to
the
will
of
europe
nor
the
fate
which
has
sometimes
overtaken
those
who
were
the
advocates
of
change
i
know
according
to
all
rule
written
and
spoken
by
the
orthodox
that
islam
can
not
move
and
yet
in
spite
of
it
i
answer
with
some
confidence
in
the
fashion
of
galileo
e
pur
si
muove
the
fact
is
islam
does
move
a
vast
change
has
come
upon
mohammedan
thought
since
its
last
legal
mujtahed
wrote
his
last
legal
opinion
and
what
was
true
of
orthodox
islam
fifty
and
even
twenty
years
ago
is
no
longer
true
now
when
urquhart
the
first
exponent
of
mohammedanism
to
englishmen
began
his
writing
the
hanefite
teaching
of
constantinople
had
not
begun
to
be
questioned
and
he
was
perfectly
justified
in
citing
it
as
the
only
rule
recognized
by
the
mass
of
the
orthodox
no
such
thing
as
a
liberal
religious
party
then
existed
anywhere
and
those
who
broke
the
law
in
the
name
of
political
reform
were
breakers
of
the
law
and
nothing
more
every
good
man
was
their
enemy
and
if
any
spoke
of
liberty
he
was
understood
as
meaning
licence
it
was
not
even
conceived
then
that
the
sheriat
might
be
legally
remodelled
now
however
and
especially
within
the
last
ten
years
a
large
section
of
godly
and
men
have
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
of
liberal
opinion
and
serious
attempts
have
been
made
to
reconcile
a
desire
of
improvement
with
unabated
loyalty
to
islam
a
true
liberal
party
has
thus
been
formed
which
includes
in
its
ranks
not
merely
political
intriguers
of
the
type
familiar
to
europe
in
midhat
pasha
but
men
of
sincere
piety
who
would
introduce
moral
as
well
as
political
reforms
into
the
practice
of
mohammedans
these
have
it
in
their
programme
to
make
the
practice
of
religion
more
austere
while
widening
its
basis
to
free
the
intelligence
of
believers
from
scholastic
trammels
and
at
the
same
time
to
enforce
more
strictly
the
higher
moral
law
of
the
koran
which
has
been
so
long
and
so
strangely
violated
in
this
they
stand
in
close
resemblance
to
the
reformers
of
christianity
and
some
of
the
circumstances
which
have
given
them
birth
are
so
analogous
to
those
which
europe
encountered
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
draw
in
one
own
mind
a
parallel
leading
to
the
conviction
that
islam
too
will
work
out
for
itself
a
reformation
the
two
chief
agents
of
religious
reform
in
europe
were
the
misery
of
the
poor
and
the
general
spread
of
knowledge
it
is
difficult
at
this
distance
of
time
to
conceive
how
abject
was
the
general
state
of
the
european
peasantry
in
the
days
of
louis
xi
of
france
and
frederick
iii
of
germany
the
constant
wars
and
almost
as
constant
famines
the
general
insecurity
of
the
conditions
of
life
the
dependence
of
a
vast
majority
of
the
poor
on
capricious
patrons
the
hideous
growth
of
corruption
and
licentiousness
in
the
ruling
classes
and
the
impotence
of
the
ruled
to
obtain
justice
above
all
the
servile
acquiescence
of
religion
which
should
have
protected
them
in
the
political
illegalities
daily
witnessed
all
these
things
stirring
the
hearts
of
men
caused
them
to
cry
out
against
the
existing
order
of
church
discipline
and
inclined
them
to
reform
on
the
other
hand
as
we
all
know
the
invention
of
printing
had
caused
men
to
read
and
the
invention
of
the
new
world
to
travel
moreover
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
ottoman
turks
then
an
irresistible
power
were
invading
europe
and
a
new
element
of
contact
with
an
outside
world
was
created
and
a
new
fear
christendom
certainly
at
that
time
was
in
danger
of
political
annihilation
or
fancied
itself
to
be
so
and
the
apprehensions
of
devout
persons
in
central
europe
were
roused
to
a
vivid
consciousness
of
impending
evil
by
the
thought
that
this
was
perhaps
another
authorized
scourge
of
god
i
will
not
strain
the
parallel
further
than
it
will
bear
but
i
would
suggest
that
causes
somewhat
analogous
to
these
are
now
at
work
among
the
mussulmans
of
the
still
independent
states
of
islam
and
that
they
are
operating
somewhat
in
the
same
direction
the
mussulman
peasantry
especially
of
the
ottoman
empire
are
miserable
and
they
know
that
they
are
so
and
they
look
in
vain
to
their
religion
to
protect
them
as
in
former
days
against
their
rulers
they
find
that
all
their
world
now
is
corrupt
that
the
law
is
broken
daily
by
those
who
should
enforce
the
law
that
the
illegalities
of
those
who
ruin
them
are
constantly
condoned
by
a
conniving
body
of
the
ulema
that
for
all
practical
purposes
of
justice
and
mercy
religion
has
abdicated
its
claim
to
direct
and
govern
they
have
learned
too
by
their
intercourse
with
strangers
and
in
the
towns
by
the
newspapers
which
they
now
eagerly
read
that
this
has
not
been
always
so
and
that
servitude
is
not
the
natural
state
of
man
or
acquiescence
in
evil
the
true
position
of
religion
and
they
see
in
all
they
suffer
an
outrage
inflicted
on
the
better
law
of
islam
i
was
much
struck
by
hearing
the
egyptian
peasantry
last
year
attribute
the
lighter
taxes
they
were
then
enjoying
to
the
fact
that
their
new
ruler
was
a
man
who
feared
god
at
the
same
time
the
learned
classes
are
shocked
and
alarmed
at
the
political
decline
of
islam
and
the
still
greater
dangers
which
stare
her
in
the
face
and
they
attribute
them
to
the
unchecked
wickedness
and
corruption
with
which
the
long
rule
of
constantinople
has
pervaded
every
class
of
society
even
beyond
its
own
territorial
borders
they
complain
now
that
they
have
been
led
astray
and
believe
that
the
vengeance
of
heaven
will
overtake
them
if
they
do
not
amend
their
ways
in
all
this
i
say
there
is
something
of
the
spirit
which
once
goaded
christians
into
an
examination
of
the
bases
on
which
their
belief
rested
and
of
the
true
nature
of
the
law
which
tolerated
such
great
corruption
nor
must
we
suppose
that
any
part
of
this
dissatisfaction
is
attributable
as
yet
to
a
decay
of
faith
such
as
we
now
witness
among
ourselves
islam
as
yet
shows
hardly
a
taint
of
infidelity
the
mussulman
of
the
present
day
whatever
his
rank
in
life
believes
with
as
absolute
a
faith
as
did
the
christian
of
the
period
just
referred
to
with
the
exception
of
here
and
there
a
false
convert
or
as
a
very
rare
case
an
europeanized
infidel
of
the
modern
type
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
mohammedan
sceptic
that
is
to
say
a
moslem
who
does
not
believe
in
the
divine
mission
of
mohammed
he
may
neglect
every
duty
of
his
profession
be
guilty
of
every
crime
have
broken
every
law
he
may
be
the
worst
and
the
most
depraved
of
men
or
on
the
other
hand
he
may
have
adopted
the
language
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
tone
of
thought
of
europe
and
a
thing
far
more
rare
he
may
be
even
a
scoffer
and
blasphemer
still
i
do
not
imagine
that
in
his
heart
he
any
the
less
firmly
believes
that
the
koran
is
the
book
of
truth
or
that
at
the
day
of
judgment
he
shall
be
found
with
those
who
have
escaped
jehannem
through
their
professed
acknowledgment
of
god
and
of
his
apostle
i
have
heard
strange
stories
in
corroboration
of
this
from
persons
whom
i
could
not
doubt
and
about
persons
whom
all
the
world
knew
thus
one
who
was
with
fuad
pasha
the
most
european
of
ottoman
diplomatists
in
his
last
days
at
nice
assures
me
that
his
whole
time
was
spent
in
a
recitation
of
the
koran
learning
it
by
heart
another
who
was
called
the
voltaire
of
islam
performed
his
prayers
and
prostrations
with
scrupulous
regularity
whenever
he
found
himself
in
private
and
a
third
equally
notorious
as
a
sceptic
died
of
religious
mania
all
too
who
have
mingled
much
with
mussulmans
must
have
been
struck
with
the
profound
resignation
with
which
even
thoughtless
and
irreligious
men
bear
the
ills
of
life
and
the
fortitude
with
which
they
usually
meet
their
end
with
the
large
proportion
that
they
see
of
men
who
habitually
pray
and
fast
and
who
on
occasion
at
great
risk
and
sacrifice
make
the
pilgrimage
and
with
the
general
absence
of
profanity
and
the
fact
that
an
avowal
of
religion
is
never
proffered
apologetically
as
with
us
nor
met
in
any
society
with
derision
these
things
are
perhaps
not
in
themselves
evidence
of
belief
for
hypocrites
have
everywhere
their
reward
but
the
fact
even
of
hypocrisy
proves
the
general
spirit
to
be
one
of
avowed
belief
the
truly
devout
are
doubtless
rare
but
where
we
find
them
it
is
evident
that
their
belief
pervades
their
lives
in
as
strict
a
sense
as
it
does
devout
persons
among
ourselves
it
would
probably
be
difficult
to
point
out
in
europe
men
who
in
the
world
i
do
not
speak
of
ecclesiastics
or
persons
in
religious
orders
lead
more
transparently
religious
lives
than
do
the
pious
moslems
of
the
better
class
whom
one
may
find
in
almost
any
oriental
town
or
men
who
more
closely
follow
the
ideal
which
their
creed
sets
before
them
to
doubt
the
sincerity
and
even
in
a
certain
sense
the
sanctity
of
such
persons
would
be
to
doubt
all
religion
in
any
case
it
is
notorious
that
the
faith
of
mecca
is
still
the
living
belief
of
a
vast
number
of
the
human
race
the
rule
of
their
lives
and
the
explanation
to
them
of
their
whole
existence
there
is
no
sign
as
yet
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
living
faith
neither
in
considering
its
future
is
it
easy
for
a
candid
english
mind
to
escape
the
admission
that
for
all
purposes
of
argument
the
mohammedan
creed
must
be
treated
as
no
vain
superstition
but
a
true
religion
true
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
form
of
the
worship
of
that
one
true
god
in
whom
europe
in
spite
of
her
modern
reason
still
believes
as
such
it
is
entitled
to
whatever
credit
we
may
give
true
religions
of
prolonged
vitality
and
while
admitting
the
eternal
truth
of
christianity
for
ourselves
we
may
be
tempted
to
believe
that
in
the
arabian
mind
if
in
no
other
islam
too
will
prove
eternal
in
its
simplest
form
islam
was
but
an
emphatic
renewal
of
the
immemorial
creed
of
the
semites
and
as
long
as
a
pure
semitic
race
is
left
in
the
world
the
revelation
of
mecca
may
be
expected
to
remain
a
necessary
link
in
their
tradition
no
modern
arguments
of
science
are
ever
likely
to
affect
the
belief
of
arabia
that
god
has
at
sundry
times
and
in
sundry
places
spoken
to
man
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophets
and
among
these
prophets
mohammed
will
always
be
the
most
conspicuous
because
the
most
distinctly
national
also
the
law
of
islam
i
am
not
speaking
merely
of
the
sheriat
as
we
now
see
it
will
always
remain
their
law
because
it
is
the
codification
of
their
custom
and
its
political
organization
their
political
organization
because
it
is
founded
on
a
practice
coeval
with
their
history
lastly
semitic
thought
is
a
strong
leaven
which
everywhere
pervades
the
minds
of
nations
aliens
though
they
be
who
have
once
admitted
it
and
it
will
not
easily
be
cast
out
we
have
seen
in
europe
even
in
england
a
land
never
brought
physically
into
contact
with
arabia
how
long
arabian
thought
filtered
as
it
was
through
france
and
spain
to
our
shores
has
dominated
our
ideas
chivalry
a
notion
purely
bedouin
is
hardly
yet
extinct
among
us
romance
the
offspring
of
arabia
is
still
a
common
motive
of
our
action
and
our
poets
express
it
still
to
the
neglect
of
classic
models
in
the
rhymed
verse
of
yemen
the
mass
of
our
people
still
pray
to
the
god
of
abraham
and
turn
eastwards
towards
that
land
which
is
arabia
the
holy
land
of
the
jews
if
then
we
who
are
mere
aliens
find
it
impossible
to
escape
this
subtle
influence
what
must
it
be
for
those
races
wholly
or
half
arabian
who
have
for
centuries
been
impregnated
with
islam
the
quintessence
of
arabian
thought
who
shall
fix
the
term
of
its
power
and
say
that
it
can
not
renew
itself
and
live
send
forth
says
a
famous
english
writer
who
was
also
a
famous
english
statesman
a
great
thought
as
you
have
done
before
from
mount
sinai
from
the
villages
of
galilee
from
the
deserts
of
arabia
and
you
may
again
remodel
all
institutions
change
their
principles
of
action
and
breathe
a
new
spirit
into
the
scope
of
their
existence
but
i
must
not
lose
myself
in
generalities
or
forget
that
it
is
for
practical
englishmen
that
i
am
writing
to
be
precise
i
see
two
ways
in
which
it
is
probable
that
islam
will
attempt
to
renew
her
spiritual
life
and
two
distinct
lines
of
thought
which
according
to
external
circumstances
she
may
be
expected
to
follow
the
first
a
violent
and
hardly
a
permanent
one
the
second
the
true
solution
of
her
destiny
among
the
popular
beliefs
of
islam
and
it
is
one
common
to
every
sect
shiite
and
abadite
as
well
as
sunite
is
this
one
that
in
the
latter
days
of
the
world
when
the
power
of
god
worshippers
shall
have
grown
weak
and
their
faith
corrupted
a
leader
shall
arise
who
shall
restore
the
fortunes
of
the
true
believers
he
shall
begin
by
purging
the
earth
of
injustice
fighting
against
oppressors
wherever
he
shall
find
them
mohammedan
as
well
as
infidel
and
he
shall
teach
the
people
a
perfect
law
which
they
shall
have
forgotten
and
he
shall
reign
over
islam
in
place
of
their
khalifeh
being
called
the
móhdy
or
guide
to
this
some
add
that
he
will
arise
of
a
sudden
in
some
distant
corner
of
the
earth
and
that
he
will
march
towards
mecca
and
that
everywhere
the
blood
of
moslems
shall
be
shed
like
water
and
that
he
shall
enter
mecca
when
the
streets
shall
run
with
blood
in
support
of
this
coming
of
the
móhdy
many
traditions
exist
which
are
held
to
be
authentic
by
the
ulema
thus
it
is
related
on
the
authority
of
abdallah
ibn
messaoud
that
he
heard
the
prophet
say
when
there
shall
remain
but
one
day
of
the
days
of
the
earth
god
shall
prolong
that
day
and
shall
send
forth
from
my
house
a
man
bearing
my
name
and
the
name
of
my
father
mohammed
ibn
abdallah
and
he
shall
purify
the
earth
from
injustice
and
fill
it
with
that
which
is
right
the
same
was
heard
also
by
ali
ibn
abu
taleb
the
and
by
hadhifat
ibn
el
yaman
who
relates
that
this
prophecy
was
delivered
by
mohammed
one
friday
at
the
khotbah
or
sermon
in
medina
salman
el
faris
another
witness
declares
that
he
afterwards
approached
the
prophet
and
stood
before
him
and
asked
him
from
which
of
thy
descendants
o
apostle
of
god
shall
the
móhdy
be
and
the
prophet
answered
stretching
his
hand
towards
his
grandson
huseyn
from
this
child
shall
he
come
besides
this
general
belief
which
though
not
a
positive
dogma
of
their
faith
is
common
to
all
mussulmans
the
shiites
always
prone
to
exaggerate
and
embellish
maintain
that
the
móhdy
duty
is
not
limited
to
teaching
guiding
and
purifying
the
law
but
also
that
he
shall
revenge
the
blood
unjustly
shed
of
the
imams
and
they
cite
in
support
of
this
a
tradition
of
ali
ibn
abu
taleb
who
thus
addressed
his
son
huseyn
the
same
who
was
afterwards
martyred
at
kerbela
i
swear
to
thee
o
my
son
he
said
i
swear
by
my
soul
and
by
my
offspring
and
by
kerbela
and
by
its
temple
that
the
day
shall
come
in
which
our
beards
shall
be
dyed
with
blood
and
i
swear
that
afterwards
god
shall
raise
up
a
man
the
móhdy
who
shall
stand
in
our
place
the
lord
of
mankind
he
it
is
who
shall
avenge
us
nay
he
shall
avenge
thy
blood
also
o
huseyn
therefore
have
patience
for
the
blood
of
one
man
he
shall
shed
the
blood
of
a
thousand
and
he
will
not
spare
them
who
have
helped
our
enemies
the
shiites
say
also
that
this
móhdy
will
be
no
new
personage
but
that
he
lives
already
in
the
flesh
being
no
other
than
the
twelfth
and
last
of
their
recognized
imams
who
was
born
in
the
year
of
the
hejira
and
whose
name
was
mohammed
ibn
el
hassan
abul
kassem
el
móhdy
lord
of
the
command
and
lord
of
time
and
who
while
yet
a
child
disappeared
from
the
world
retaining
nevertheless
his
authority
this
móhdy
they
expect
the
turkish
rule
is
in
after
accomplishing
his
vengeance
and
justice
he
shall
rule
for
an
undetermined
period
when
jesus
the
son
of
mary
also
shall
come
and
the
apostle
mohammed
an
apparition
which
will
announce
the
end
of
the
world
it
would
seem
therefore
exceedingly
probable
that
out
of
the
religious
ferment
which
we
now
see
agitating
africa
some
enthusiast
will
arise
who
will
announce
himself
as
this
móhdy
and
head
an
active
movement
of
reform
already
indeed
two
such
personages
have
made
their
appearance
one
in
tripoli
of
whom
i
heard
much
talk
a
year
ago
and
who
is
now
said
to
be
marching
to
join
the
defenders
of
keruan
and
a
second
quite
recently
in
soudan
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
the
kind
of
reformation
such
an
inspired
guide
would
preach
indeed
his
rôle
is
marked
out
for
him
in
the
prophecies
just
quoted
he
would
purge
the
earth
of
injustice
with
the
sword
and
breaking
with
all
authority
but
that
of
the
koran
he
would
seek
to
renew
a
kingdom
of
heaven
on
the
model
of
islam
militant
it
would
be
a
repetition
but
on
a
grander
scale
of
the
wahhabite
movement
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
having
a
wider
base
of
operations
in
the
vast
fanatical
masses
of
north
africa
might
achieve
far
more
important
results
even
without
pretending
to
the
rank
of
an
inspired
guide
it
is
certain
that
a
man
of
zeal
and
character
might
in
the
present
crisis
easily
persuade
the
malekite
arabs
to
reform
their
moral
practice
if
necessary
to
asceticism
by
proving
to
them
that
they
would
thus
regain
their
ascendancy
in
arms
on
this
basis
a
reformation
would
be
easy
but
it
would
be
analogous
to
that
of
the
hussites
and
anabaptists
in
europe
rather
than
of
the
true
church
reformation
which
succeeded
these
and
would
hardly
be
universal
or
permanent
i
once
heard
a
most
distinguished
alem
describe
the
qualifications
of
one
who
should
preach
a
reform
of
this
kind
the
man
said
he
who
would
persuade
us
to
reform
must
come
in
the
first
place
of
a
family
he
must
be
either
a
prince
or
a
sherif
or
an
hereditary
saint
this
would
secure
him
from
a
first
personal
attack
on
the
ground
of
seeming
impiety
he
must
secondly
be
an
arab
gifted
with
the
pure
language
of
the
koran
for
the
arabian
ulema
would
not
listen
to
a
barbarian
and
he
must
possess
commanding
eloquence
a
reformer
must
before
all
else
be
a
preacher
thirdly
he
must
be
profoundly
learned
that
is
to
say
versed
in
all
the
subtleties
of
the
law
and
in
all
that
has
been
written
in
commentary
on
the
koran
and
he
must
have
a
ready
wit
so
that
in
argument
he
may
be
able
constantly
to
oppose
authority
with
authority
quotation
with
quotation
granted
these
three
qualifications
and
courage
and
god
blessing
he
may
lead
us
where
he
will
the
chief
obstacles
however
to
a
reformation
of
this
sort
would
not
be
in
the
beginning
nor
would
they
be
wholly
moral
ones
the
full
programme
of
the
móhdy
needs
that
he
should
conquer
mecca
and
the
land
road
thither
of
an
african
reformer
lies
blocked
by
egypt
and
the
suez
canal
so
that
unless
he
should
succeed
in
crossing
the
red
sea
through
abyssinia
an
invasion
which
by
the
way
would
fulfil
another
ancient
prophecy
which
states
that
the
companions
of
the
elephant
the
abyssinians
shall
one
day
conquer
hejaz
he
could
not
carry
out
his
mission
nor
except
as
an
ally
against
the
turk
would
a
fanatical
reformer
now
find
much
sympathy
in
arabia
proper
the
peninsular
arabs
have
had
their
puritan
reformation
already
and
a
strong
reaction
has
set
in
amongst
them
in
favour
of
liberal
thought
they
are
in
favour
still
of
reform
but
it
is
of
another
kind
from
that
preached
by
abd
el
wahhab
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
a
new
militant
islam
would
find
many
adherents
amongst
them
the
only
strong
advocate
of
such
views
at
the
present
day
among
true
arabs
in
arabia
is
the
aged
sherif
abd
el
mutalleb
the
nominee
who
indeed
has
spared
no
pains
since
he
was
installed
at
mecca
to
fan
the
zeal
of
the
north
africans
a
wahhabi
in
his
youth
he
is
still
a
fierce
puritan
and
it
is
possible
that
should
he
live
long
enough
he
is
said
to
be
ninety
years
old
he
may
be
able
to
produce
a
corresponding
zeal
in
arabia
but
at
present
the
mass
of
the
arabs
in
hejaz
no
less
than
in
nejd
and
yemen
are
occupied
with
more
humane
ideas
abd
el
mutalleb
chief
supporters
in
mecca
are
not
his
own
countrymen
but
the
indian
colony
descendants
many
of
them
of
the
sepoy
refugees
who
fled
thither
in
and
who
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
fanatical
of
all
its
residents
the
true
arabs
are
in
revolt
against
his
authority
again
it
is
improbable
that
any
enunciation
of
puritan
reform
would
find
support
among
the
northern
races
of
asia
which
are
uniformly
sunk
in
gross
sensuality
and
superstition
while
constantinople
may
be
trusted
to
oppose
all
reform
whatever
wahhabism
when
it
overspread
southern
asia
never
gained
a
foothold
further
north
than
syria
and
broke
itself
to
pieces
at
last
against
the
corrupt
orthodoxy
of
constantinople
and
so
too
it
would
happen
now
abd
el
hamid
in
spite
of
his
zeal
for
islam
would
see
in
the
preaching
of
a
moral
reform
only
a
new
heresy
and
as
we
have
seen
the
móhdy
mission
is
against
all
evil
rule
the
sultan
and
caliph
not
excepted
so
that
unless
abd
el
hamid
places
himself
openly
at
the
head
of
the
warlike
movement
in
africa
and
so
forestalls
a
rival
he
is
not
likely
long
to
give
it
his
loyal
support
already
there
are
symptoms
of
his
regarding
events
in
tunis
with
suspicion
and
on
the
first
announcement
of
an
inspired
reformer
he
would
i
believe
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
against
him
i
understand
the
turkish
military
reinforcements
at
tripoli
quite
as
much
in
the
light
of
a
precaution
against
arab
reform
as
against
infidel
france
puritanism
then
on
a
militant
basis
even
if
preached
by
the
móhdy
himself
could
hardly
be
either
general
or
lasting
and
its
best
result
would
probably
be
that
after
a
transient
burst
of
energy
which
would
rouse
the
thought
of
islam
and
renew
her
spiritual
life
a
humaner
spirit
as
in
arabia
would
take
its
place
and
lead
to
a
more
lasting
because
a
more
rational
reform
but
it
was
not
to
such
a
puritan
reformation
that
i
was
pointing
when
i
expressed
my
conviction
that
islam
would
in
the
end
work
out
her
salvation
nor
do
i
hold
it
necessary
that
she
should
find
any
such
ex
as
an
inspired
guide
to
point
her
out
her
road
her
reformation
is
indeed
already
begun
and
may
be
gradually
carried
to
its
full
results
by
no
violent
means
and
in
a
progressive
not
a
reactionary
spirit
this
only
can
be
the
true
one
for
it
is
a
law
of
nations
and
of
faiths
no
less
than
of
individuals
that
they
can
not
really
return
upon
their
years
and
that
all
beneficial
changes
for
them
must
be
to
new
conditions
of
life
not
to
old
ones
to
greater
knowledge
not
to
less
to
freedom
of
thought
not
to
its
enslavement
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
true
principles
of
islam
to
make
such
progress
an
unnatural
solution
of
her
destiny
mohammedanism
in
its
institution
and
for
many
centuries
after
its
birth
was
eminently
a
rationalistic
creed
and
it
was
through
reason
as
well
as
faith
that
it
first
achieved
its
spiritual
triumphs
if
we
examine
its
bases
its
early
history
we
must
indeed
admit
this
the
koran
which
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
as
the
written
code
of
mohammedan
law
is
in
reality
no
legal
by
which
mussulmans
live
at
best
it
enunciates
clearly
certain
religious
truths
the
unity
of
god
the
doctrine
of
rewards
and
punishments
in
a
future
life
and
the
revelation
of
god
claims
on
man
psalms
many
of
them
sublime
occupy
the
greater
number
of
its
chapters
promises
of
bliss
to
believers
and
destruction
to
unbelievers
come
next
then
the
traditional
history
of
revelation
as
it
was
current
among
the
semitic
race
and
only
in
the
later
chapters
and
then
obscurely
anything
which
can
properly
be
classed
as
law
yet
law
is
the
essence
of
islam
and
was
so
from
its
earliest
foundation
as
a
social
and
religious
polity
and
it
is
evident
that
to
it
and
not
to
the
koran
dogmatic
theology
islam
owed
its
great
and
long
career
of
triumph
in
the
world
now
this
law
was
not
like
the
koran
brought
down
from
heaven
at
first
it
was
little
more
than
a
confirmation
of
the
common
custom
of
arabia
supplemented
indeed
and
corrected
by
revelation
but
based
upon
existing
rules
of
right
and
wrong
when
however
islam
emerged
from
arabia
in
the
first
decade
of
her
existence
and
embracing
a
foreign
civilization
found
herself
face
to
face
with
new
conditions
of
life
mere
custom
ceased
to
be
a
sufficient
guide
and
the
voice
of
direct
revelation
having
ceased
the
faithful
were
thrown
upon
their
reason
to
direct
them
how
they
were
to
act
revelation
continued
nevertheless
to
be
the
groundwork
of
their
reasoning
and
the
teaching
of
their
great
leader
the
justification
of
each
new
development
of
law
as
the
cases
requiring
it
arose
the
koran
was
cited
wherever
it
was
possible
to
find
a
citation
and
where
these
failed
tradition
was
called
in
the
companions
of
the
prophet
were
in
the
first
instance
consulted
and
their
recollections
of
his
sayings
and
doings
quoted
freely
while
afterwards
when
these
too
were
gone
the
companions
of
the
companions
took
their
place
and
became
in
their
turn
cited
thus
by
a
subtle
process
of
comparison
and
reasoning
worked
out
through
many
generations
the
mohammedan
law
as
we
see
it
was
gradually
built
up
until
in
the
third
century
of
islam
it
was
embodied
by
order
of
the
caliph
into
a
written
code
the
fakh
ed
din
and
the
fakh
esh
sheriat
of
abu
hanifeh
the
doctor
intrusted
with
this
duty
was
a
first
attempt
to
put
into
reasoned
form
the
floating
tradition
of
the
faithful
and
to
make
a
digest
of
existing
legal
practice
he
and
his
contemporaries
examined
into
and
put
in
order
the
accumulated
wealth
of
authority
on
which
the
law
rested
and
taking
this
and
rejecting
that
saying
of
the
fathers
of
islam
founded
on
them
a
school
of
teaching
which
has
ever
since
been
the
basis
of
mohammedan
jurisprudence
abu
hanifeh
code
however
does
not
appear
to
have
been
intended
at
the
time
it
was
drawn
up
to
be
the
absolute
and
final
expression
of
all
lawful
practice
for
the
faithful
it
included
a
vast
amount
of
tradition
of
which
either
no
use
was
made
by
its
compiler
or
which
stood
in
such
contradiction
with
itself
that
a
contrary
interpretation
of
it
to
his
could
with
equal
logic
be
deduced
abu
hanifeh
quoted
and
argued
rather
than
determined
and
as
long
as
the
arabian
mind
continued
to
be
supreme
in
islam
the
process
of
reasoning
development
continued
the
hanefite
code
was
supplemented
by
later
doctors
malek
esh
shafy
and
ibn
hanbal
and
even
by
others
whose
teaching
has
been
since
repudiated
all
in
the
avowed
intention
of
suiting
the
law
still
further
to
the
progressive
needs
of
the
faithful
and
all
following
the
received
process
of
selecting
and
interpreting
and
reasoning
from
tradition
these
codes
were
for
the
then
existing
conditions
of
life
admirable
and
even
now
wherever
those
conditions
have
remained
unaltered
are
amply
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
good
government
and
the
regulation
of
social
conduct
they
would
nevertheless
have
been
but
halting
places
in
the
march
of
mohammedan
legislation
had
the
destinies
of
islam
remained
permanently
in
the
hands
of
its
first
founders
unfortunately
about
the
eleventh
century
of
our
era
a
new
and
unfortunate
influence
began
to
make
itself
felt
in
the
counsels
of
the
arabian
ulema
which
little
by
little
gaining
ground
succeeded
at
last
in
stopping
the
flow
of
intellectual
progress
at
the
fountain
head
the
tartar
who
then
first
makes
his
appearance
in
mohammedan
politics
though
strong
in
arms
was
slow
to
understand
he
had
no
habit
of
thought
and
having
embraced
islam
he
saw
no
necessity
for
further
argument
concerning
it
the
language
of
the
koran
and
the
traditions
was
a
science
sealed
to
him
and
the
reasoning
intelligence
of
the
arab
whose
dominion
he
had
invaded
was
a
constant
reproof
to
him
he
dared
not
venture
his
barbarian
dignity
in
the
war
of
wit
which
occupied
the
schools
and
so
fortified
his
unintelligence
behind
a
rampart
of
dogmatic
faith
impotent
to
develop
law
himself
he
clutched
blindly
at
that
which
he
found
written
to
his
hand
the
code
of
abu
hanifeh
seemed
to
him
a
perfect
thing
and
he
made
it
the
resting
place
of
his
legal
reason
then
as
he
gradually
possessed
himself
of
all
authority
he
declared
further
learning
profane
and
virtually
closed
the
schools
his
military
triumphs
in
the
sixteenth
century
sealed
the
intellectual
fate
of
islam
and
from
that
day
to
our
own
no
light
of
discussion
has
illumined
moslem
thought
in
any
of
the
old
centres
of
her
intelligence
reason
the
eye
of
her
faith
in
early
times
has
been
fast
shut
by
many
it
has
been
argued
blind
it
is
only
in
the
present
generation
and
in
the
face
of
those
dangers
and
misfortunes
to
which
islam
finds
herself
exposed
that
recourse
has
once
more
been
had
to
intellectual
methods
and
it
is
precisely
in
those
regions
of
islam
where
arab
thought
is
strongest
that
we
now
find
the
surest
symptoms
of
returning
mental
life
modern
arabia
wherever
she
has
come
in
contact
with
what
we
call
the
civilization
of
the
world
has
shown
herself
ready
and
able
to
look
it
in
the
face
and
she
is
now
setting
herself
seriously
to
solve
the
problem
of
her
own
position
and
that
of
her
creed
towards
it
in
north
africa
indeed
civilization
for
the
moment
presents
itself
to
her
only
as
an
enemy
but
where
her
intelligence
has
remained
unclouded
by
the
sense
of
political
wrong
she
has
proved
herself
capable
not
only
of
understanding
the
better
thought
of
europe
but
of
sympathizing
with
it
as
akin
to
her
own
thus
at
cairo
now
that
the
influence
of
constantinople
has
been
partially
removed
we
find
the
arabian
ulema
rapidly
assimilating
to
their
own
the
higher
principles
of
our
european
thought
and
engrafting
on
their
lax
moral
practice
some
of
the
better
features
of
our
morality
it
is
at
no
sacrifice
of
imagined
dignity
as
with
the
turks
that
egypt
is
seeking
a
legal
means
for
universal
religious
toleration
or
from
any
pressure
but
that
of
their
own
intelligence
that
her
chief
people
are
beginning
to
reform
their
domestic
life
and
even
in
some
instances
to
adopt
the
practice
of
monogamy
the
truth
would
seem
to
be
that
the
same
process
is
being
effected
in
their
minds
as
was
formerly
the
case
with
their
ancestors
in
the
eighth
century
the
arabs
brought
into
contact
with
greek
philosophy
assimilated
it
by
a
natural
process
of
their
reasoning
into
the
body
of
their
own
beliefs
and
now
in
the
nineteenth
they
are
assimilating
a
foreign
morality
into
their
own
system
of
morals
not
only
in
egypt
in
oman
and
peninsular
arabia
generally
there
is
a
real
feeling
of
cordiality
between
the
mohammedan
and
his
christian
guest
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
zanzibar
was
a
concession
to
european
opinion
at
least
as
much
as
to
european
force
and
a
moral
sympathy
is
acknowledged
between
a
moslem
and
a
christian
state
which
has
its
base
in
a
common
sense
of
right
and
justice
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
were
the
people
of
yemen
to
effect
their
deliverance
from
constantinople
the
same
humane
feeling
would
be
found
to
exist
among
them
and
i
know
that
it
exists
in
nejd
while
even
in
hejaz
which
is
commonly
looked
upon
as
the
of
religious
intolerance
i
found
all
that
was
truly
arabian
in
the
population
as
truly
liberal
under
the
late
grand
sherif
abd
el
hamid
reputed
victim
these
ideas
were
rapidly
gaining
ground
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
untimely
end
i
have
high
authority
for
stating
that
the
mohammedan
holy
land
would
now
be
open
to
european
intercourse
and
slavery
or
at
least
the
slave
trade
be
there
abolished
there
is
therefore
some
reason
to
hope
that
were
arabian
thought
once
more
supreme
in
islam
its
tendency
would
be
in
the
direction
of
a
wider
and
more
liberal
reading
of
the
law
and
that
in
time
a
true
reconciliation
might
be
effected
with
christendom
perhaps
with
christianity
the
great
difficulty
which
as
things
now
stand
besets
reform
is
this
the
sheriat
or
written
code
of
law
still
stands
in
orthodox
islam
as
an
authority
the
law
in
itself
is
an
excellent
law
and
as
such
commends
itself
to
the
loyalty
of
honest
and
men
but
on
certain
points
it
is
irreconcilable
with
the
modern
needs
of
islam
and
it
can
not
legally
be
altered
when
it
was
framed
it
was
not
suspected
that
mohammedans
would
ever
be
subjects
of
a
christian
power
or
that
the
mohammedan
state
would
ever
need
to
accommodate
itself
to
christian
demands
in
its
internal
policy
it
contemplated
too
mainly
a
state
of
war
and
it
accepted
slavery
and
concubinage
as
war
natural
concomitants
it
did
not
understand
that
some
day
islam
would
have
to
live
at
peace
with
its
neighbours
if
it
would
live
at
all
or
that
the
general
moral
sense
of
the
world
would
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
with
such
force
that
the
higher
instincts
of
moslems
themselves
should
feel
the
necessity
of
restricting
its
old
and
rather
barbarous
licence
as
to
marriage
and
divorce
yet
these
things
have
come
to
pass
or
are
rapidly
coming
and
the
best
thinkers
in
islam
now
admit
that
changes
in
the
direction
indicated
must
sooner
or
later
be
made
only
they
insist
that
these
should
be
legally
effected
not
forced
on
them
by
an
overriding
of
the
law
what
they
want
is
legal
authority
to
now
no
such
authority
exists
either
in
the
ottoman
sultan
or
in
the
sherif
or
in
any
sheykh
el
islam
mufti
or
body
of
ulema
in
the
world
none
of
these
dare
seriously
meddle
with
the
law
there
is
not
even
one
universally
recognized
tribunal
to
which
all
moslems
may
refer
their
doubts
about
the
law
proper
reading
and
have
their
disputes
resolved
a
fetwa
or
opinion
is
all
that
can
be
given
and
it
applies
only
to
the
land
where
it
is
issued
the
fetwa
of
this
great
alem
in
one
moslem
state
may
be
reversed
by
the
fetwa
of
another
in
that
the
sheykh
el
islam
at
constantinople
may
be
appealed
against
to
the
mufti
at
mecca
or
cairo
or
these
again
it
may
be
to
bokhara
none
absolutely
overrides
the
rest
thus
while
i
was
at
jeddah
there
came
a
deputation
of
mussulmans
from
bengal
being
on
their
way
to
mecca
to
ask
a
fetwa
on
the
disputed
point
whether
believers
were
permitted
or
not
to
use
european
dress
a
previous
fetwa
had
been
asked
at
constantinople
but
the
deputation
was
dissatisfied
alleging
that
the
sheykh
el
islam
there
could
not
be
trusted
and
that
they
preferred
the
meccan
mufti
thus
moslems
who
would
see
their
way
to
improvement
are
constantly
faced
with
a
legal
bar
the
want
of
authority
things
there
is
no
remedy
for
this
an
opinion
however
seems
now
to
be
gaining
ground
among
the
learned
that
a
legal
issue
may
one
day
be
found
in
the
restoration
to
the
caliphate
of
what
is
called
by
them
the
el
the
living
voice
of
islam
which
in
its
first
period
and
indeed
till
the
destruction
of
the
abbaside
dynasty
by
holagu
belonged
to
the
successors
of
the
prophet
it
is
certain
that
in
the
first
four
reigns
of
abu
bekr
omar
othman
and
ali
such
a
living
power
to
legislate
was
accorded
to
the
caliphs
and
that
on
their
own
authority
they
modified
at
will
the
yet
unwritten
law
thus
it
is
related
of
abu
bekr
that
in
one
instance
he
set
aside
a
law
called
the
mota
though
based
directly
on
some
sentences
of
the
koran
declaring
it
not
conformable
to
the
better
tradition
and
that
ali
again
reversed
this
ruling
which
has
nevertheless
been
adhered
to
by
the
sunites
later
too
the
ommiad
and
abbaside
caliphs
exercised
this
right
of
legislation
by
deputy
it
was
in
their
names
that
the
mujtaheddin
abu
hanifeh
and
the
rest
framed
their
first
codes
of
law
and
to
the
last
the
words
of
their
mouth
were
listened
to
as
in
some
measure
inspired
utterances
by
the
faithful
it
was
only
when
the
sacred
office
passed
from
the
sacred
and
legitimate
house
that
this
feeling
of
reverence
ceased
and
the
living
voice
of
the
caliph
was
disregarded
in
islam
the
ottoman
conqueror
when
he
took
upon
him
the
title
of
emir
el
mumenin
did
not
venture
to
claim
for
himself
the
power
to
teach
nor
would
moslems
have
listened
to
any
such
pretension
the
house
of
othman
was
from
the
first
sunk
in
degrading
vices
and
was
too
untaught
to
teach
the
account
given
us
by
bertrandon
de
la
brocquière
in
the
fifteenth
century
of
the
court
and
habits
of
the
grand
turk
is
evidently
no
exaggeration
and
it
is
easy
to
conceive
by
the
light
of
it
how
impossible
it
must
have
been
for
the
arabian
ulema
to
connect
the
notion
of
inspiration
in
any
way
with
such
personages
as
the
sultans
then
were
as
a
fact
the
saut
el
haï
was
not
claimed
by
selim
nor
has
it
ever
been
accorded
to
his
descendants
the
want
of
some
voice
of
authority
is
nevertheless
becoming
daily
more
generally
felt
by
orthodox
mohammedans
and
it
seems
to
me
certain
that
in
some
shape
or
other
it
will
before
long
be
restored
to
general
recognition
abd
el
hamid
whose
spiritual
ambition
i
have
described
has
quite
recently
caused
a
legal
statement
of
his
caliphal
rights
to
be
formally
drawn
up
and
it
includes
this
right
of
the
el
and
though
it
is
improbable
that
the
faithful
will
at
the
eleventh
hour
of
its
rule
invest
the
house
of
othman
with
so
sublime
a
prerogative
it
is
extremely
likely
that
when
a
more
legitimate
holder
of
the
title
shall
have
been
found
he
will
be
conceded
all
the
rights
of
the
sacred
office
then
the
legal
difficulty
will
at
last
be
overcome
the
dead
hand
of
the
law
will
be
no
longer
dead
but
will
be
inspired
by
a
living
voice
and
will
since
we
are
imagining
many
things
we
may
imagine
this
one
too
that
our
caliph
of
the
koreysh
chosen
by
the
faithful
and
installed
at
mecca
should
invite
the
ulema
of
every
land
to
a
council
at
the
time
of
the
pilgrimage
and
there
appointing
a
new
mujtahed
should
propound
to
them
certain
modifications
of
the
sheriat
as
things
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
islam
and
deducible
from
tradition
no
point
of
doctrine
need
in
any
way
be
touched
only
the
law
the
fakh
ed
din
would
need
hardly
a
modification
the
fakh
esh
sheriat
would
in
certain
chapters
have
to
be
rewritten
who
can
doubt
that
an
omar
or
an
haroun
were
they
living
at
the
present
day
would
authorize
such
changes
or
that
the
faithful
of
their
day
would
have
accepted
them
as
necessary
and
legitimate
developments
of
koranic
teaching
it
would
be
an
interesting
study
to
pursue
this
inquiry
further
and
to
see
how
it
might
be
worked
out
in
detail
the
crying
necessity
of
civilized
islam
is
a
legal
with
europe
and
such
an
adaptation
of
its
law
on
points
where
europe
insists
as
shall
suffice
to
stave
off
conflict
it
is
evident
that
legal
equality
must
now
be
accorded
to
christians
living
under
mohammedan
law
and
that
conformity
on
the
other
hand
in
certain
points
to
foreign
law
must
be
allowed
to
moslems
living
under
christian
rule
again
slavery
must
by
some
means
be
made
illegal
and
a
stricter
interpretation
of
the
koranic
permission
be
put
on
marriage
concubinage
and
divorce
that
all
these
changes
might
be
logically
effected
by
a
process
of
reasoning
from
the
traditions
and
expanding
or
minimising
the
interpretation
of
the
koran
no
one
need
doubt
who
remembers
what
fetwas
have
already
been
given
on
these
very
points
by
some
of
the
azhar
ulema
at
present
these
decisions
are
unsatisfactory
to
the
faithful
at
large
because
those
issuing
them
have
no
recognized
authority
to
strain
the
law
but
with
authority
the
same
decisions
would
meet
with
general
approval
at
least
such
is
the
impression
of
modern
mohammedan
opinion
made
on
me
by
my
conversation
with
mohammedans
it
would
be
interesting
to
work
out
these
points
and
i
hope
some
day
to
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
but
for
the
present
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
knowledge
sufficient
for
the
purpose
i
must
be
content
with
having
suggested
the
method
i
can
not
work
out
the
details
of
a
reformation
it
may
however
give
an
idea
of
the
kind
of
material
in
tradition
which
reformers
are
looking
for
if
i
quote
a
document
which
was
being
circulated
last
spring
among
the
ulema
of
the
azhar
it
purports
to
be
the
text
of
the
prophet
first
treaty
with
the
christians
of
arabia
though
i
do
not
vouch
for
its
authenticity
and
runs
as
follows
covenant
of
god
apostle
mohammed
with
the
christian
people
their
monks
and
their
mohammed
the
apostle
of
god
sent
with
a
message
of
peace
to
all
mankind
dictateth
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
the
cause
of
god
may
be
a
written
document
between
him
and
the
people
of
christ
he
who
keepeth
this
covenant
let
him
be
called
a
true
moslem
worthy
of
the
religion
of
god
and
he
who
departeth
from
it
let
him
be
called
an
enemy
be
he
king
or
subject
great
or
small
to
this
have
i
pledged
myself
i
will
fence
in
their
lands
with
my
horsemen
and
my
footmen
and
my
allies
throughout
the
world
and
i
will
care
for
their
safety
and
the
safety
of
their
temples
their
churches
their
oratories
and
their
convents
and
the
places
of
their
pilgrimage
wheresoever
i
shall
find
them
whether
by
the
land
or
by
the
sea
in
the
east
or
in
the
west
on
the
mountain
or
in
the
plain
in
the
desert
or
in
the
city
there
will
i
stand
behind
them
that
no
harm
shall
reach
them
and
my
followers
shall
keep
them
from
evil
this
is
my
covenant
with
them
i
will
exempt
them
in
all
matters
wherein
the
moslems
are
exempt
i
command
also
that
no
one
of
their
bishops
be
expelled
from
his
see
nor
shall
any
christian
be
forced
from
his
religion
nor
shall
a
monk
be
forced
from
his
convent
nor
a
hermit
from
his
cell
it
is
my
will
that
none
of
their
holy
buildings
be
destroyed
or
taken
from
them
for
mosques
by
my
people
or
for
their
dwellings
whosoever
despiseth
this
command
is
guilty
before
god
and
despiseth
the
pledge
of
his
apostle
all
monks
and
bishops
and
the
dependents
of
these
i
declare
exempt
from
tribute
except
such
as
they
shall
of
their
free
will
bring
nor
shall
christian
merchants
doing
business
by
sea
or
diving
for
pearls
or
working
in
the
mines
for
gold
or
silver
or
jewels
even
the
wealthy
and
the
mighty
pay
more
than
twelve
drachmas
of
yearly
tribute
this
for
such
christian
merchants
as
shall
live
in
arabia
but
for
travellers
and
strangers
in
the
land
they
are
exempt
likewise
such
as
have
lands
and
gardens
bearing
fruit
and
fields
for
corn
shall
pay
no
more
than
it
is
in
their
power
to
bring
and
the
people
to
whom
i
have
pledged
my
word
shall
not
be
required
to
fight
for
themselves
but
the
moslems
shall
protect
them
asking
them
neither
for
arms
nor
rations
nor
horses
for
the
war
except
such
as
each
shall
choose
to
bring
but
if
any
shall
bring
money
or
help
the
moslems
in
war
it
must
be
acknowledged
them
with
thanks
and
this
is
my
command
no
moslem
shall
molest
a
follower
of
christ
and
if
he
dispute
with
him
it
shall
be
with
good
manners
and
if
a
christian
do
any
man
wrong
it
shall
be
a
duty
with
moslems
to
stay
the
avenger
and
make
peace
between
them
paying
the
ransom
if
the
wrong
demand
a
ransom
and
it
is
my
wish
that
christians
should
not
be
disregarded
by
my
followers
for
i
have
pledged
my
word
unto
them
before
god
that
they
shall
be
as
moslems
in
my
sight
sharing
and
partaking
of
all
things
with
the
rest
and
in
their
marriages
they
shall
not
be
troubled
no
moslem
shall
say
to
a
christian
me
thy
daughter
nor
take
her
unless
he
be
willing
and
if
a
christian
woman
become
a
slave
to
a
moslem
he
shall
be
bound
by
this
covenant
to
leave
her
her
religion
nor
shall
he
compel
her
to
disobey
her
religious
chiefs
this
is
the
command
of
god
and
whosoever
shall
deny
it
and
disobey
god
shall
hold
him
for
a
liar
moreover
it
shall
be
a
duty
with
my
followers
to
repair
the
churches
of
the
christians
rendering
them
the
service
not
as
a
debt
but
for
god
sake
and
for
the
keeping
of
the
covenant
made
to
them
by
the
apostle
of
god
no
christian
shall
be
compelled
to
go
forth
in
time
of
war
as
an
envoy
or
spy
against
his
people
these
are
the
privileges
which
mohammed
the
apostle
of
god
hath
granted
to
the
followers
of
christ
in
return
he
requested
them
to
deal
with
him
and
with
the
moslems
as
follows
none
of
them
in
time
of
war
shall
give
assistance
either
openly
or
in
secret
to
the
enemies
of
islam
they
shall
not
give
asylum
in
their
churches
or
in
their
houses
to
the
enemies
of
islam
they
shall
not
help
them
with
arms
or
rations
or
horses
or
men
they
shall
not
keep
counsel
with
the
declared
enemies
of
islam
nor
receive
them
in
their
houses
nor
deposit
money
with
them
they
shall
grant
to
all
moslems
seeking
their
hospitality
entertainment
for
at
least
three
days
but
no
moslem
shall
require
of
them
to
make
special
cooking
for
him
and
he
shall
eat
of
the
common
food
with
his
host
if
a
moslem
seek
asylum
with
a
christian
the
christian
shall
not
refuse
to
shelter
him
and
shall
not
deliver
him
to
his
enemies
what
christian
soever
shall
refuse
these
my
requests
he
shall
not
partake
of
the
privileges
of
this
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
the
bishops
monks
and
the
rest
the
followers
of
christ
and
i
call
god
to
witness
with
my
followers
and
command
them
to
keep
faithful
to
this
my
precept
now
and
till
the
day
of
judgment
the
above
was
written
in
the
presence
of
the
persons
dictated
by
the
apostle
of
god
and
written
down
by
mawiyeh
ibn
abu
sofian
on
monday
at
the

of
the
fourth
month
of
the
fourth
year
of

the

in
conclusion
i
would
urge
that
while
it
is
to
mohammedans
themselves
that
we
must
look
to
work
out
their
ultimate
regeneration
according
to
the
rules
of
their
own
law
and
conscience
christendom
can
still
do
much
to
influence
immediate
results
the
day
of
religious
hatred
between
moslem
and
christian
as
such
is
i
hope
nearly
at
an
end
and
though
political
strife
is
unfortunately
renewing
the
old
quarrel
in
north
africa
there
is
no
danger
now
of
its
becoming
on
europe
part
a
crusade
christendom
has
pretty
well
abandoned
her
hopeless
task
of
converting
islam
as
islam
has
abandoned
hers
of
conquering
europe
and
it
is
surely
time
that
moral
sympathy
should
unite
the
two
great
bodies
of
men
who
believe
in
and
worship
the
same
god
england
at
least
may
afford
now
to
acknowledge
mohammedanism
as
something
not
to
be
merely
combated
and
destroyed
but
to
be
accepted
by
her
and
encouraged
accepted
as
a
fact
which
for
good
or
evil
will
exist
in
the
world
whether
she
will
or
no
encouraged
because
it
has
in
it
possibilities
of
good
which
she
can
not
replace
by
any
creed
or
philosophy
of
her
own
she
can
do
much
to
help
these
possibilities
for
they
depend
for
the
moment
on
her
political
action
there
is
a
good
cause
and
a
bad
in
islam
as
elsewhere
in
the
world
and
though
hitherto
england
physical
help
has
been
given
all
to
evil
it
has
been
through
ignorance
of
the
issues
at
stake
and
i
am
confident
that
as
she
learns
these
she
will
acknowledge
the
wrong
she
has
unconsciously
been
doing
and
repair
while
there
is
yet
time
her
error
in
my
next
and
concluding
chapter
i
propose
to
sketch
a
policy
towards
islam
worthy
of
england
high
sense
of
duty
and
conformable
to
her
true
interests
footnotes
a
remarkable
coincidence
of
prediction
christian
and
mohammedan
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
in
rohrbacher
history
of
the
church
published
in
where
by
an
elaborate
calculation
based
on
the
old
testament
prophecies
he
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
the
turkish
empire
will
fall
in
the
date
assigned
it
also
by
the
mohammedan
prediction
quoted
in
my
last
chapter
that
is
to
say
this
claim
has
been
endorsed
by
abd
el
mutalleb
who
is
issuing
a
or
pastoral
letter
this
year
to
the
pilgrims
in
support
of
abd
el
hamid
caliphate
chapter
england
interest
in
islam
nothing
now
remains
for
me
but
to
point
the
moral
which
these
essays
were
designed
to
draw
it
will
have
been
observed
that
hitherto
i
have
avoided
as
much
as
possible
all
allusion
to
the
direct
political
action
which
christendom
is
exercising
and
must
ever
more
and
more
exercise
upon
the
fortunes
of
islam
and
in
this
i
have
been
guided
by
two
motives
i
have
wished
first
to
give
prominence
to
the
fact
that
in
all
great
movements
of
the
human
intellect
the
force
of
progression
or
decay
should
be
looked
for
mainly
from
within
not
from
without
and
secondly
to
simplify
my
subject
so
as
to
render
it
more
easily
intelligible
to
the
reading
public
we
have
reached
however
the
point
now
when
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
different
ground
and
look
at
islam
no
longer
as
regards
her
internal
economy
but
as
she
is
being
affected
by
the
world
at
large
we
must
inquire
what
influence
the
material
pressure
of
europe
is
likely
to
have
on
her
in
the
levant
and
what
in
africa
and
central
asia
and
above
all
we
must
examine
closely
our
own
position
towards
her
and
the
course
which
duty
and
interest
require
us
to
pursue
in
regard
to
the
vast
mussulman
population
of
our
indian
empire
i
take
it
the
sentiment
generally
of
continental
europe
i
do
not
speak
of
england
towards
mohammedanism
is
still
much
what
it
has
always
been
namely
one
of
social
hostility
and
political
aggression
in
spite
of
all
the
changes
which
have
affected
religious
thought
in
catholic
europe
and
of
the
modern
doctrine
of
tolerance
in
matters
of
opinion
none
of
the
nations
by
which
islam
is
immediately
confronted
to
the
north
and
west
have
really
changed
anything
of
their
policy
towards
her
since
the
days
when
they
first
resolved
on
the
recovery
of
christian
lands
lost
to
the
infidel
it
is
true
that
most
of
them
no
longer
put
forward
religious
zeal
as
the
motive
of
their
action
or
the
possession
of
the
holy
sepulchre
as
its
immediate
object
but
under
the
name
of
civilization
their
crusade
is
no
less
a
continuous
reality
and
the
direction
of
their
efforts
has
not
ceased
to
be
the
resumption
by
europe
of
political
control
in
the
whole
of
the
provinces
once
forming
the
roman
empire
the
sentiment
in
its
origin
was
a
just
one
and
though
now
become
for
the
most
part
selfish
with
the
various
christian
states
who
see
in
the
advantage
to
christendom
only
an
advantage
to
themselves
it
appeals
to
an
ancient
and
respectable
moral
sanction
which
is
in
itself
no
inconsiderable
power
it
is
certain
that
the
national
conscience
neither
of
france
nor
spain
nor
italy
nor
austria
would
repudiate
an
aggression
however
unprovoked
upon
any
of
the
still
independent
mussulman
states
of
the
mediterranean
and
that
the
only
judgment
passed
on
such
an
act
by
public
opinion
would
be
one
dependent
on
its
failure
or
success
thus
in
estimating
the
future
of
islam
as
a
political
body
and
in
view
of
the
disparity
proved
to
exist
at
all
points
between
modern
europe
and
its
ancient
rival
in
the
matter
of
physical
strength
we
must
be
prepared
to
see
the
latter
submit
at
no
distant
date
to
great
territorial
losses
along
the
whole
line
of
its
european
frontier
few
i
think
to
begin
from
the
extreme
west
will
be
inclined
to
doubt
that
should
the
french
succeed
in
thoroughly
crushing
the
arab
movement
which
they
have
provoked
in
tunis
and
which
will
in
all
probability
be
extended
next
summer
to
morocco
and
tripoli
the
beginning
of
the
next
century
will
see
what
is
left
of
the
barbary
coast
in
their
possession
or
in
that
of
spain
or
italy
and
the
greater
part
of
the
cultivable
lands
fronting
the
mediterranean
occupied
by
their
immigrants
what
france
has
done
or
attempted
to
do
in
algiers
her
two
neighbours
may
possibly
achieve
with
even
more
success
in
morocco
and
western
tripoli
for
the
spaniards
and
italians
are
both
eminently
colonizing
races
and
the
hill
country
of
barbary
is
little
different
in
climate
from
their
own
tripoli
on
the
break
up
of
the
ottoman
empire
will
certainly
tempt
italian
statesmen
and
spain
has
already
a
footing
on
the
african
coast
in
tetuan
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
the
better
lands
on
the
seaboard
will
receive
a
flood
of
such
agriculturists
from
either
country
as
now
seek
their
fortunes
on
the
river
plate
and
elsewhere
should
such
be
the
case
the
mohammedan
population
may
be
ousted
from
their
possession
of
the
soil
and
driven
southwards
at
least
for
a
time
and
a
considerable
decrease
of
the
political
strength
of
islam
be
witnessed
in
that
quarter
i
do
not
however
conceive
that
europe
will
ever
obtain
a
sure
colonial
footing
south
of
the
atlas
or
that
the
mussulmans
of
the
sahara
will
lose
anything
of
their
present
religious
character
at
worst
southern
morocco
and
fezzan
will
always
remain
independent
mohammedan
states
the
nucleuses
of
religious
life
in
barbary
and
links
between
the
mussulmans
of
northern
and
central
africa
while
further
east
the
growing
influence
of
egypt
will
make
itself
felt
intellectually
to
the
advantage
of
believers
it
is
however
to
central
africa
that
islam
must
in
the
future
look
for
a
centre
of
religious
gravity
westwards
there
in
the
conversion
of
the
negro
race
of
the
tropics
already
so
rapidly
proceeding
she
has
good
prospect
of
compensation
for
all
losses
on
the
mediterranean
coast
and
screened
by
the
sahara
and
by
a
climate
unsuited
to
european
life
she
may
retain
for
centuries
her
political
as
well
as
her
religious
independence
the
negro
races
will
not
only
be
mohammedanised
they
will
also
be
arabised
and
a
community
of
language
and
of
custom
will
thus
preserve
for
soudan
its
connection
with
mecca
and
so
with
the
general
life
of
islam
the
losses
then
to
islam
in
africa
will
be
rather
apparent
than
real
and
may
even
in
the
end
prove
a
source
of
new
strength
nor
must
we
lose
sight
of
the
possibility
of
a
french
defeat
i
believe
that
at
no
time
during
the
past
forty
years
has
the
military
position
of
our
allies
been
in
a
graver
peril
in
their
colony
than
now
or
the
resources
of
their
antagonists
greater
it
is
a
weakness
of
the
french
system
in
africa
that
it
has
made
no
attempt
to
assimilate
the
native
population
and
it
is
the
strength
of
that
population
in
as
far
as
it
is
arab
that
it
does
assimilate
french
thought
to
its
own
advantage
it
is
far
from
certain
whether
the
conquest
of
algiers
may
not
some
day
have
for
its
effect
the
renewal
of
mohammedan
political
vitality
in
all
the
barbary
coast
a
more
absolute
and
immediate
loss
must
be
anticipated
in
europe
and
western
asia
there
it
is
pretty
certain
that
in
a
very
few
years
ottoman
rule
will
have
ceased
and
the
lands
composing
the
empire
been
absorbed
by
one
or
other
of
the
powerful
neighbours
who
have
so
long
coveted
their
possession
austria
in
person
or
by
deputy
may
be
expected
by
the
end
of
the
present
century
to
have
inherited
the
european
and
russia
the
asiatic
provinces
of
turkey
proper
while
the
fate
of
syria
and
egypt
will
only
have
been
averted
if
averted
it
be
by
the
intervention
of
england
that
a
dissolution
of
the
empire
may
and
will
be
easily
accomplished
i
have
myself
little
doubt
the
military
power
of
constantinople
though
still
considerable
for
the
purposes
of
internal
control
will
hardly
again
venture
to
cope
with
any
european
state
nor
is
it
in
the
least
probable
that
the
sultan
will
receive
further
christian
support
from
without
the
fall
of
kars
has
laid
asia
minor
open
to
the
russian
arms
and
the
territorial
cessions
of
san
stefano
and
berlin
have
laid
roumelia
open
to
the
austrian
on
the
first
occasion
of
a
quarrel
with
the
porte
a
simultaneous
advance
from
both
quarters
would
preclude
the
chance
of
even
a
serious
struggle
and
the
subjugation
of
the
races
would
be
effected
without
more
difficulty
the
weakness
of
the
empire
from
a
military
point
of
view
is
that
it
is
dependent
wholly
on
its
command
of
the
sea
a
position
which
enables
it
to
mass
what
troops
it
has
rapidly
on
the
points
required
but
which
even
a
mediterranean
power
could
wrest
from
it
its
communication
cut
by
a
naval
blockade
the
empire
would
almost
without
further
action
be
dissolved
whatever
loyalty
the
sultan
may
have
lately
achieved
outside
his
dominions
there
is
not
only
no
spirit
of
national
resistance
in
asia
minor
itself
but
the
provinces
even
the
most
mussulman
would
hail
an
invading
army
as
a
welcome
deliverer
from
him
left
to
themselves
they
would
abandon
without
compunction
the
cause
and
the
next
war
of
an
european
state
with
turkey
will
not
only
be
her
last
but
it
will
in
all
likelihood
hardly
be
fought
out
by
her
nor
do
i
conceive
that
the
fall
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
the
annexation
of
its
turkish
provinces
would
be
a
mere
political
loss
of
so
much
territory
to
islam
it
would
involve
moral
consequences
far
greater
than
this
for
the
whole
mussulman
world
of
asia
i
have
the
authority
of
the
most
enlightened
of
modern
asiatic
statesmen
in
support
of
my
opinion
that
it
would
be
the
certain
deathblow
of
mohammedanism
as
a
permanent
religious
faith
in
all
the
lands
west
of
the
caspian
and
that
even
among
the
tartar
races
of
the
far
east
the
sunite
mussulmans
of
siberia
and
the
khanates
and
as
far
as
the
great
wall
of
china
it
would
be
a
shock
from
which
sunism
in
its
present
shape
would
with
difficulty
recover
what
has
hitherto
supported
the
religious
constancy
of
orthodox
believers
in
those
lands
formerly
ottoman
which
have
become
subject
to
russia
has
been
throughout
the
consciousness
that
there
was
still
upon
the
russian
border
a
great
militant
body
of
men
of
their
own
faith
ruled
by
its
acknowledged
spiritual
head
the
centre
of
their
religious
pride
has
been
constantinople
where
the
sultan
and
caliph
has
sat
enthroned
upon
the
bosphorus
commanding
the
two
worlds
of
europe
and
asia
and
securing
to
them
communication
with
the
holy
places
of
their
devotion
and
the
living
body
of
true
believers
their
has
been
maintained
by
this
feeling
and
with
it
fidelity
to
their
traditions
moreover
the
school
of
sophia
has
been
a
of
religious
knowledge
the
university
at
which
the
ulema
of
kazan
and
tiflis
and
astrachan
have
received
their
spiritual
education
while
at
all
times
religious
personages
from
constantinople
have
travelled
among
them
keeping
alive
the
recollection
of
their
lost
allegiance
on
this
basis
their
faith
has
retained
what
it
has
of
loyalty
in
spite
of
the
political
russianising
they
have
undergone
but
with
their
political
centre
destroyed
they
would
be
as
sheep
without
a
shepherd
scattered
in
little
groups
here
and
there
among
a
growing
christian
population
and
shut
out
from
the
fold
of
their
belief
constantinople
is
the
assembling
place
of
pilgrimage
for
all
mohammedans
west
of
the
ural
mountains
who
reach
it
by
the
black
sea
and
could
never
be
replaced
to
them
by
any
new
centre
further
south
among
the
arab
races
with
whom
they
have
little
sympathy
or
direct
religious
connection
a
caliph
at
mecca
or
in
egypt
could
do
little
for
them
and
the
sunites
would
have
no
university
open
to
them
nearer
than
bokhara
in
this
respect
they
would
find
themselves
in
a
far
worse
position
than
the
moors
however
universally
these
may
become
subject
to
europe
and
their
religious
disintegration
would
be
a
mere
question
of
time
i
believe
therefore
that
islam
must
be
prepared
for
a
loss
not
only
of
political
power
in
europe
and
in
western
asia
but
also
of
the
mohammedan
population
in
the
ottoman
lands
absorbed
by
russia
it
will
be
a
strange
revenge
of
history
if
the
ottoman
turks
whom
europe
has
for
so
many
centuries
held
to
be
the
symbolic
figure
of
mohammedanism
shall
one
day
cease
to
be
mohammedan
yet
it
is
a
revenge
our
children
or
our
grandchildren
may
well
live
to
see
how
far
eastward
the
full
results
of
this
religious
disintegration
may
extend
it
is
perhaps
fanciful
to
speculate
the
provinces
of
persia
which
are
inhabited
by
mussulmans
of
mixed
race
speaking
the
turkish
language
and
largely
interfused
with
christian
armenians
would
i
am
inclined
to
think
follow
the
destiny
of
the
west
and
ultimately
accept
christianity
as
a
dominant
religion
but
east
of
the
caspian
sunite
islam
though
severely
shaken
may
yet
hope
to
survive
and
hold
its
ground
for
centuries
the
present
policy
of
russia
whatever
it
may
be
in
europe
is
far
from
hostile
to
mohammedanism
in
central
asia
as
a
religion
it
is
even
protected
there
and
it
is
encouraged
by
the
government
in
its
missionary
labours
among
the
idolatrous
tribes
of
the
steppes
and
among
the
buddhists
who
are
largely
accepting
its
doctrines
in
the
extreme
east
hitherto
there
has
been
no
christian
colonization
in
the
direction
of
the
khanates
nor
is
there
any
indigenous
form
of
christianity
moreover
central
asia
though
connected
by
ties
of
sympathy
with
constantinople
has
never
been
politically
or
even
religiously
dependent
on
it
it
has
a
university
of
its
own
in
bokhara
a
seat
of
learning
still
renowned
throughout
asia
and
it
is
thither
and
not
to
sophia
that
the
sunite
mussulmans
east
of
the
caspian
proceed
for
their
degrees
mohammedanism
therefore
in
eastern
asia
is
not
exposed
to
such
immediate
danger
as
in
the
west
bokhara
may
lose
its
political
independence
but
there
is
no
probability
for
many
generations
to
come
of
its
being
christianized
as
constantinople
certainly
must
be
and
it
may
even
on
the
fall
of
the
latter
become
the
chief
centre
of
sunite
orthodoxy
of
the
existing
hanefite
type
remaining
so
perhaps
long
after
the
rest
of
islam
shall
have
abandoned
hanefism
it
is
obvious
however
that
cut
off
geographically
as
the
khanates
are
from
the
general
life
of
islam
bokhara
can
but
vaguely
represent
the
present
religious
power
of
constantinople
and
will
be
powerless
to
influence
the
general
flow
of
mohammedan
thought
its
influence
could
be
exerted
only
through
india
and
would
be
supported
by
no
political
prestige
so
that
it
is
far
more
likely
in
the
future
to
follow
than
to
lead
opinion
otherwise
isolation
is
its
only
fate
the
future
of
shiite
mohammedanism
in
persia
proper
is
a
still
more
doubtful
problem
exposed
like
the
rest
of
central
asia
to
russian
conquest
the
persian
monarchy
can
not
without
a
speedy
and
complete
revolution
of
its
internal
condition
fail
to
succumb
politically
the
true
irâni
however
have
an
unique
position
in
mohammedan
asia
which
may
save
them
from
complete
absorption
unlike
any
mohammedan
race
except
the
arabian
they
are
distinctly
national
the
turk
conqueror
though
he
has
always
been
repudiates
still
the
name
of
turk
calling
himself
simply
a
moslem
and
so
likewise
do
the
less
distinguished
races
he
has
subjected
but
the
persian
does
not
do
this
he
is
before
all
things
irâni
and
to
the
extent
that
he
has
made
for
himself
a
mohammedanism
of
his
own
he
boasts
of
a
history
and
a
literature
older
far
than
islam
and
has
not
consented
to
forget
it
as
a
thing
belonging
only
to
the
age
of
ignorance
he
runs
therefore
little
risk
of
being
either
russianised
or
christianised
by
conquest
and
being
of
an
intellectual
fibre
superior
to
that
of
the
russians
and
as
far
as
the
mass
of
the
population
is
concerned
being
physically
as
well
gifted
it
may
be
supposed
that
he
will
survive
if
he
can
not
avert
his
political
subjugation
there
is
at
the
present
moment
i
am
informed
a
last
desperate
effort
making
at
teheran
for
the
of
the
empire
on
a
liberal
basis
of
government
and
though
it
would
be
folly
to
count
much
on
its
success
it
may
conceivably
succeed
mohammedanism
would
not
there
as
at
constantinople
be
found
a
barrier
to
reform
for
persian
shiism
is
an
eminently
elastic
creed
and
on
the
contrary
may
it
is
thought
be
made
the
instrument
of
a
social
reformation
only
as
i
have
said
it
would
be
folly
to
count
on
its
success
and
there
are
certain
moral
defects
in
persian
character
which
do
not
encourage
shiite
mohammedanism
however
whether
persia
be
absorbed
or
not
by
russia
is
of
little
importance
in
a
general
review
of
islam
future
and
may
safely
be
dismissed
as
not
directly
relevant
to
the
main
question
before
us
admitting
then
the
probability
nay
the
certainty
of
considerable
political
and
territorial
losses
northwards
caused
by
the
violent
pressure
of
a
hostile
europe
let
us
see
what
yet
remains
to
islam
as
her
certain
heritage
and
how
the
changes
foreshadowed
may
affect
her
general
life
i
can
not
myself
find
any
cause
of
despair
for
mussulmans
in
the
prospect
of
a
curtailment
of
their
religious
area
in
the
directions
indicated
or
any
certain
reason
of
exultation
for
their
enemies
in
the
thought
that
with
the
fall
of
constantinople
islam
too
will
have
fallen
on
the
contrary
i
see
in
the
coming
destruction
of
the
ottoman
supremacy
and
in
the
exclusion
of
the
northern
races
even
at
the
cost
of
their
religious
support
from
the
counsels
of
the
faithful
an
element
of
hope
in
the
future
far
outweighing
the
immediate
chagrin
which
may
be
caused
by
loss
of
sovereignty
or
loss
of
population
the
mohammedan
population
which
the
fall
of
constantinople
would
conceivably
cut
off
from
the
main
body
could
not
at
most
number
more
than
some
twenty
millions
and
when
we
remember
that
this
is
no
more
than
a
tithe
of
the
whole
mussulman
census
and
that
the
proportion
is
a
constantly
decreasing
one
it
will
be
evident
that
there
is
little
ground
for
looking
at
the
loss
as
one
necessarily
fatal
to
religion
the
northern
races
still
give
to
mohammedanism
an
appearance
of
physical
strength
but
it
is
an
appearance
only
and
it
is
given
at
the
cost
of
its
intellectual
vigour
the
political
success
of
the
turks
has
for
centuries
thrown
islam
off
its
moral
equilibrium
and
their
disappearance
from
its
supreme
counsels
will
give
weight
to
races
more
worthy
of
representing
religious
interests
constantinople
will
be
replaced
by
cairo
or
mecca
and
the
tartar
by
the
arab
an
exchange
which
intellectually
considered
no
lover
of
islam
need
deplore
one
great
result
the
fall
of
constantinople
certainly
will
have
which
i
believe
will
be
a
beneficial
one
it
will
give
to
mohammedanism
a
more
distinctly
religious
character
than
it
has
for
many
centuries
possessed
and
by
forcing
believers
to
depend
upon
spiritual
instead
of
temporal
arms
will
restore
to
them
more
than
any
political
victories
could
do
their
lost
moral
life
even
independently
of
considerations
of
race
as
between
turk
and
arab
i
believe
that
the
fall
of
the
mussulman
empire
as
a
great
temporal
dominion
would
relieve
islam
of
a
burden
of
sovereignty
which
she
is
no
longer
able
in
the
face
of
the
modern
world
to
support
she
would
escape
the
stigma
of
political
depravity
now
clinging
to
her
and
her
aims
would
be
simplified
and
intensified
i
have
already
stated
my
opinion
that
it
is
to
arabia
that
mussulmans
must
in
the
future
look
for
a
centre
of
their
religious
system
and
a
return
of
their
caliphate
to
mecca
will
signify
more
than
a
mere
political
change
it
is
obvious
that
empire
will
be
there
impossible
in
the
sense
given
to
it
at
constantinople
and
that
the
display
of
armies
and
the
mundane
glory
of
vast
palaces
and
crowds
of
slaves
will
be
altogether
out
of
place
the
caliph
of
the
future
in
whatever
city
he
may
fix
his
abode
will
be
chiefly
a
spiritual
and
not
a
temporal
king
and
will
be
limited
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
by
few
conditions
of
the
existing
material
kind
he
will
be
spared
the
burden
of
despotic
government
the
odium
of
and
conscription
over
unwilling
populations
the
constant
struggle
to
maintain
his
authority
in
arms
and
the
as
constant
intrigue
against
rival
mohammedan
princes
it
is
probable
that
all
these
would
readily
acknowledge
the
nominal
sovereignty
of
a
caliph
who
could
not
pretend
to
coerce
them
physically
and
that
the
spiritual
allegiance
of
orthodox
believers
everywhere
would
accrue
to
him
as
other
mohammedan
sovereignty
relaxed
its
hold
thus
the
dream
of
what
is
called
may
yet
be
fulfilled
though
in
another
form
from
that
in
which
it
is
now
presented
to
the
faithful
by
abd
el
hamid
and
the
ulema
of
constantinople
that
islam
in
this
spiritual
form
may
achieve
more
notable
triumphs
than
by
arms
in
eastern
and
southern
asia
we
may
well
believe
and
even
that
it
may
establish
itself
one
day
as
the
prevailing
religion
of
the
continent
its
moral
advance
within
recent
times
in
the
malay
archipelago
in
china
in
tartary
and
in
india
encourages
the
supposition
that
under
alien
rule
mohammedanism
will
be
able
to
hold
its
own
and
more
than
own
against
all
rivals
and
that
in
the
decay
of
buddhism
it
and
not
christianity
will
be
the
form
under
which
god
will
eventually
be
worshipped
in
the
tropics
its
progress
among
the
malays
under
dutch
rule
is
certainly
an
astonishing
phenomenon
and
taken
in
connection
with
a
hardly
less
remarkable
progress
in
equatorial
africa
may
well
console
those
mussulmans
who
see
in
the
loss
of
their
temporal
dominions
northwards
signs
of
the
decay
of
islam
could
such
a
reformation
as
was
suggested
in
my
last
chapter
be
indeed
effected
the
vigour
of
conversion
would
doubtless
be
redoubled
independently
of
any
condition
of
political
prosperity
in
the
ancient
seats
of
mohammedan
dominion
i
do
not
therefore
see
in
territorial
losses
a
sign
of
islam
ruin
as
a
moral
and
intellectual
force
in
the
world
it
is
time
however
to
consider
the
special
part
destined
to
be
played
by
england
in
the
drama
of
the
mussulman
future
england
if
i
understand
her
history
rightly
stands
towards
islam
in
a
position
quite
apart
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
european
states
these
i
have
described
as
continuing
a
tradition
of
aggression
inherited
from
the
crusades
and
from
the
bitter
wars
waged
by
the
latin
and
greek
empires
against
the
growing
power
of
the
ottoman
turks
in
the
latter
england
took
no
part
her
religious
schism
having
already
separated
her
from
the
general
interests
of
catholic
europe
while
she
had
withdrawn
from
the
former
in
the
still
honourable
stage
of
the
adventure
and
consequently
remained
with
no
humiliating
memories
to
avenge
she
came
therefore
into
her
modern
relations
with
mohammedans
unprejudiced
against
them
and
able
to
treat
their
religious
and
political
opinions
in
a
humane
and
liberal
spirit
seeking
of
them
practical
advantages
of
trade
rather
than
conquest
nor
has
the
special
nature
of
her
position
towards
them
been
unappreciated
by
mohammedans
in
spite
of
the
deceptions
on
some
points
of
late
years
and
recent
vacillations
of
policy
towards
them
the
still
independent
nations
of
islam
see
in
england
something
different
from
the
rest
of
christendom
something
not
in
its
nature
hostile
to
them
or
regardless
of
their
rights
and
interests
they
know
at
least
that
they
have
nothing
to
dread
from
englishmen
on
the
score
of
religious
intolerance
and
there
is
even
a
tendency
with
some
of
them
to
exaggerate
the
sympathy
displayed
towards
them
by
supposing
a
community
of
beliefs
on
certain
points
considered
by
them
essential
thus
the
idea
is
common
among
the
ignorant
in
many
mussulman
countries
that
the
english
are
or
unitarians
in
contradistinction
to
the
rest
of
christians
who
are
condemned
as
or
polytheists
and
the
turkish
alliance
is
explained
by
them
on
this
supposition
supplemented
in
the
case
of
the
turks
themselves
with
the
idea
that
england
is
itself
a
part
of
islam
and
so
its
natural
ally
these
are
of
course
but
ideas
of
the
vulgar
yet
they
represent
a
fact
which
is
not
without
importance
namely
that
england
is
accepted
by
mussulmans
as
a
friendly
not
a
hostile
influence
and
that
her
protection
is
sought
without
that
suspicion
which
is
attached
to
the
friendly
offices
of
other
powers
even
in
india
where
englishmen
have
supplanted
the
mussulmans
as
a
ruling
race
the
sentiment
towards
british
rule
is
not
as
far
as
i
can
learn
and
compared
with
that
of
other
sections
of
the
indian
community
a
hostile
one
the
mussulmans
of
delhi
and
the
punjab
would
no
doubt
desire
a
resumption
by
themselves
of
practical
authority
in
the
country
where
they
were
till
lately
masters
but
they
are
conscious
that
they
are
not
strong
enough
now
to
effect
this
and
their
feeling
towards
english
rule
is
certainly
less
bitter
than
towards
the
hindoos
their
former
subjects
now
their
rivals
were
they
in
any
way
specially
protected
in
their
religious
interests
by
the
indian
government
they
would
i
am
confident
make
not
only
contented
but
actively
loyal
subjects
as
things
stand
therefore
it
would
seem
natural
that
in
the
general
disruption
which
will
follow
the
fall
of
constantinople
it
is
to
england
the
various
nations
of
islam
should
look
mainly
for
direction
in
their
political
difficulties
the
place
of
adviser
and
protector
indeed
seems
pointed
out
for
her
with
the
disappearance
of
the
ottoman
sultan
there
will
be
no
longer
any
great
mussulman
sovereignty
in
the
world
and
the
mohammedan
population
of
india
already
the
wealthiest
and
most
numerous
will
then
assume
its
full
importance
in
the
counsels
of
believers
it
will
also
assuredly
be
expected
of
the
english
crown
that
it
should
then
justify
its
assumption
of
the
old
mohammedan
title
of
the
moguls
by
making
itself
in
some
sort
the
political
head
of
islam
her
majesty
will
be
left
its
most
powerful
sovereign
and
it
will
be
open
to
her
advisers
if
they
be
so
minded
to
exercise
paramount
influence
on
all
its
affairs
i
do
not
say
that
they
will
be
so
minded
but
they
will
have
the
power
and
the
opportunity
to
a
degree
never
yet
presented
to
any
christian
government
of
directing
the
tone
of
thought
of
mussulmans
throughout
the
world
and
of
utilizing
the
greatest
religious
force
in
asia
for
the
purposes
of
humanity
and
progress
i
am
myself
profoundly
convinced
that
on
england
acceptance
or
refusal
of
this
mission
the
future
of
her
dominion
in
india
will
mainly
depend
and
with
it
the
whole
solution
of
the
problem
she
has
set
to
herself
of
civilizing
southern
asia
let
us
see
what
our
actual
relations
with
mohammedanism
are
and
what
is
the
value
of
its
goodwill
to
us
in
asia
and
first
as
to
india
i
find
in
our
latest
authority
the
following
figures
mussulman
census
of
india
bengal
assam
provinces
ajmere
oudh
punjab
central

total
these
are
large
figures
taken
merely
as
they
stand
but
in
point
of
fact
they
represent
far
more
than
is
apparent
to
understand
them
at
their
full
value
it
must
be
remembered
first
that
the
mussulman
population
is
a
largely
increasing
one
not
only
in
actual
numbers
but
in
its
proportion
to
the
other
races
and
sects
of
the
peninsula
a
fact
which
i
believe
the
census
returns
of
when
published
will
amply
prove
secondly
that
its
geographical
distribution
coincides
pretty
closely
with
that
of
the
political
life
and
energy
of
the
country
the
punjab
and
the
provinces
alone
contain
an
aggregate
of
thirteen
million
mussulmans
thirdly
that
it
is
homogeneous
to
a
degree
shown
by
no
other
indian
community
though
less
numerous
by
than
the
whole
hindoo
population
it
is
far
more
so
than
any
coherent
section
of
that
population
and
is
thus
the
largest
body
of
opinion
in
the
empire
fourthly
it
is
also
the
most
generally
enlightened
it
is
the
only
section
of
the
community
which
knows
its
own
history
and
preserves
the
tradition
of
its
lost
political
importance
and
if
it
has
held
itself
aloof
hitherto
from
competition
with
other
races
for
the
public
service
it
has
been
through
pride
rather
than
inability
what
mussulmans
there
are
who
have
entered
the
service
of
government
have
been
men
of
distinguished
capacity
and
lastly
it
is
no
isolated
body
but
remains
in
close
communication
with
the
mass
of
its
throughout
the
world
the
mohammedan
population
of
india
is
therefore
an
exceptional
as
well
as
a
large
one
our
second
interest
in
mohammedanism
lies
in
egypt
here
standing
at
the
threshold
of
our
commerce
with
the
east
we
find
another
large
community
almost
wholly
mussulman
for
whose
we
are
already
to
a
certain
extent
pledged
and
in
whose
political
future
we
perceive
our
own
to
be
involved
a
hostile
egypt
we
rightly
hold
to
be
an
impossibility
for
our
position
and
religious
antagonism
at
cairo
even
if
controlled
by
military
occupation
would
be
to
us
a
constant
menace
nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
egypt
like
the
barbary
coast
will
into
whose
hands
soever
it
falls
change
its
religious
aspect
the
population
of
the
delta
is
too
industrious
too
sober
and
content
with
too
little
to
fear
competition
as
agriculturists
with
either
italians
greeks
or
maltese
and
the
conditions
of
life
under
a
torrid
sun
will
always
protect
egypt
from
becoming
an
european
colony
the
towns
may
indeed
be
overrun
by
foreigners
but
the
heart
of
the
country
will
remain
unchanged
and
like
india
will
refuse
to
remodel
itself
on
any
foreign
system
of
civilization
mohammedanism
therefore
will
maintain
itself
in
egypt
intact
and
its
will
remain
our
necessity
a
third
interest
lies
in
asiatic
turkey
this
we
have
guaranteed
by
treaty
against
foreign
invasion
and
though
our
pledge
is
nominally
to
the
sultan
not
to
the
people
of
the
empire
and
though
that
pledge
is
contingent
upon
an
impossibility
administrative
reform
and
is
therefore
not
strictly
binding
it
is
impossible
to
escape
the
admission
that
we
have
a
moral
obligation
towards
the
mussulmans
of
asia
minor
and
syria
how
far
we
may
be
disposed
or
able
to
fulfil
it
remains
to
be
seen
i
do
not
myself
anticipate
any
further
intervention
on
the
part
of
england
in
defence
of
the
lands
these
from
their
geographical
position
lie
outside
our
effective
military
control
and
dishonourable
as
a
retreat
from
our
engagements
will
be
to
us
it
may
be
a
necessity
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
an
english
army
could
effectively
protect
either
asia
minor
or
mesopotamia
from
russian
invasion
the
occupation
of
kars
has
given
russia
the
command
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
and
with
them
of
armenia
kurdistan
and
irak
so
that
our
protection
could
hardly
be
extended
beyond
the
of
asia
minor
and
the
persian
gulf
no
such
inability
however
applies
to
syria
there
if
we
we
certainly
carry
out
our
engagements
a
mere
strip
of
seaboard
backed
by
the
desert
and
attackable
only
from
the
north
on
a
narrow
frontier
of
some
hundred
miles
syria
is
easily
defensible
by
a
nation
holding
the
sea
it
is
probable
that
a
railway
run
from
the
gulf
of
scanderun
to
the
euphrates
and
supported
by
a
single
important
fortress
would
be
sufficient
to
effect
its
military
security
at
least
for
many
years
and
syria
might
thus
have
given
to
it
a
chance
of
and
some
compensation
for
misfortunes
in
which
we
have
had
no
inconsiderable
share
but
this
is
an
interest
of
honour
rather
than
of
political
necessity
to
england
and
he
must
possess
a
sanguine
mind
who
in
the
present
temper
of
englishmen
would
count
greatly
on
such
motives
as
likely
to
determine
the
action
of
their
government
if
however
it
should
be
otherwise
it
is
evident
that
the
success
of
such
a
protectorate
would
depend
principally
upon
the
mohammedan
element
in
syria
which
so
greatly
preponderates
over
any
other
a
fourth
interest
also
a
moral
one
but
connected
with
an
accepted
fact
of
english
policy
is
the
attempted
abolition
of
the
african
slave
trade
now
though
it
is
unquestionable
that
mohammedanism
permits
and
has
hitherto
encouraged
slavery
as
a
natural
condition
of
human
society
it
is
no
less
true
that
without
the
of
the
various
mussulman
princes
of
the
african
and
arabian
coasts
its
abolition
can
not
be
effected
short
of
the
occupation
by
european
garrisons
of
all
the
villages
of
the
red
sea
and
from
gardafui
southwards
to
mozambique
or
on
the
other
hand
of
the
subjection
of
all
independent
moslem
communities
in
arabia
and
elsewhere
a
real
end
or
even
a
real
check
can
not
be
put
on
the
traffic
except
through
the
of
mussulmans
themselves
the
necessity
has
indeed
been
completely
recognized
in
the
numerous
treaties
and
arrangements
made
with
the
sultans
of
turkey
zanzibar
and
oman
and
with
the
viceroy
of
egypt
and
though
i
am
far
from
stating
that
these
arrangements
are
wholly
voluntary
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
princes
yet
their
alone
can
make
the
prevention
efficient
an
excellent
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
turkish
government
which
since
its
quarrel
with
the
english
has
given
full
license
to
the
traffic
in
the
red
sea
which
no
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
latter
can
in
any
measure
check
at
no
modern
period
has
a
larger
number
of
slaves
been
imported
into
hejaz
and
yemen
than
during
the
last
eighteen
months
and
until
friendly
relations
with
the
porte
or
whatever
mussulman
authority
succeeds
the
porte
in
those
provinces
are
restored
will
continue
i
do
not
myself
entirely
sympathize
with
ideas
as
applied
to
mohammedan
lands
knowing
as
i
do
how
tolerable
and
even
advantageous
the
social
condition
of
the
negroes
is
in
them
but
still
i
wish
to
see
slavery
discontinued
and
i
believe
that
a
firm
but
friendly
attitude
towards
mussulmans
will
have
completely
extinguished
it
in
another
two
generations
a
rupture
with
them
can
only
prolong
and
aggravate
its
existence
lastly
we
may
perhaps
find
a
prospective
interest
for
england
in
the
probability
of
a
caffre
conversion
to
mohammedanism
at
no
very
remote
period
and
the
extension
of
islam
to
her
borders
in
south
africa
it
is
of
course
premature
to
be
alarmed
at
this
as
it
is
a
contingency
which
can
hardly
happen
in
the
lifetime
of
any
now
living
but
mohammedanism
is
not
a
creed
which
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
years
will
see
extinguished
in
africa
or
asia
and
already
it
has
passed
considerably
south
of
the
equator
cape
colony
at
this
day
numbers
some
fifteen
thousand
mussulmans
it
would
seem
then
on
all
these
grounds
difficult
for
england
to
ally
herself
in
dealing
with
islam
with
what
may
be
called
the
crusading
states
of
europe
her
position
is
absolutely
distinct
from
that
of
any
of
them
and
her
interests
find
no
parallel
among
christian
nations
except
perhaps
the
dutch
for
good
as
for
evil
she
has
admitted
a
vast
body
of
mohammedans
into
her
social
community
and
contracted
engagements
from
which
she
can
hardly
recede
towards
others
among
them
so
that
it
is
impossible
she
should
really
work
in
active
antagonism
to
them
as
christians
englishmen
may
regret
this
but
as
practical
men
they
would
surely
be
wise
to
recognize
the
fact
and
to
accept
the
duties
it
entails
nor
can
these
be
discharged
by
a
mere
policy
of
inaction
england
should
be
prepared
to
do
more
than
assert
a
general
doctrine
of
tolerance
and
equality
for
all
religions
in
respect
of
this
one
mohammedanism
is
not
merely
an
opinion
a
certain
political
organization
is
a
condition
of
its
existence
and
a
certain
geographical
latitude
and
moreover
it
is
a
force
which
can
not
remain
neutral
which
will
be
either
a
friend
or
a
foe
to
do
nothing
for
mussulmans
in
the
next
ten
years
will
be
to
take
cause
against
them
the
circumstances
of
their
case
do
not
admit
of
indifference
and
they
are
approaching
a
crisis
in
which
they
will
on
two
points
at
least
require
vigorous
political
protection
their
caliphate
in
some
form
of
temporal
sovereignty
though
perhaps
not
of
empire
will
have
to
be
maintained
and
short
of
securing
this
to
them
and
their
free
access
as
pilgrims
to
mecca
it
will
be
idle
to
pretend
to
mussulmans
that
we
are
protecting
their
interests
or
doing
any
part
of
our
sovereign
duty
towards
them
it
can
hardly
be
argued
that
the
indian
doctrine
of
religious
equality
will
suffer
from
doing
political
justice
to
mohammedans
on
the
downfall
therefore
of
the
ottoman
empire
whenever
that
event
shall
occur
the
of
england
in
regard
to
islam
seems
plainly
marked
out
the
caliphate
no
longer
an
empire
but
still
an
independent
sovereignty
must
be
taken
under
british
protection
and
publicly
guaranteed
its
political
existence
undisturbed
by
further
aggression
from
europe
on
the
bosphorus
no
such
guarantee
can
now
be
reasonably
given
because
there
it
lies
in
a
position
militarily
indefensible
england
is
a
naval
power
and
the
seat
of
the
caliphate
must
be
one
secured
from
all
attack
by
land
it
will
then
be
for
mohammedans
and
especially
for
the
mohammedans
of
india
to
decide
upon
the
new
metropolis
of
their
faith
the
conditions
of
their
choice
lying
within
the
narrow
limits
of
their
still
independent
lands
if
syria
be
still
free
that
metropolis
may
be
damascus
if
irak
bagdad
or
it
may
be
in
egypt
or
arabia
or
central
asia
it
is
manifest
however
that
as
far
as
british
protection
against
europe
is
concerned
the
further
it
is
removed
from
christendom
the
better
and
the
more
easily
accessible
by
sea
i
have
already
given
it
as
my
opinion
that
the
move
when
made
will
be
one
southwards
and
ultimately
to
arabia
but
it
may
well
happen
that
its
first
stage
will
be
no
further
than
cairo
the
caliphate
reached
constantinople
through
egypt
and
may
return
by
the
same
road
and
there
are
certain
quite
recent
symptoms
which
seem
to
point
in
the
direction
of
such
a
course
being
the
one
taken
the
events
of
the
last
year
in
egypt
are
significant
for
the
first
time
in
its
modern
history
a
strong
national
party
has
arisen
on
the
nile
and
has
found
full
support
from
the
azhar
ulema
who
are
now
the
most
powerful
body
of
religious
opinion
in
islam
they
are
politically
hostile
to
the
sultan
and
though
they
have
no
design
as
yet
of
repudiating
his
caliphal
title
they
are
unlikely
to
be
faithful
to
his
broken
fortunes
and
on
the
downfall
of
constantinople
will
doubtless
proclaim
a
caliph
of
their
own
the
family
of
mohammed
ali
if
popular
may
then
hope
for
their
suffrages
or
it
may
be
some
seyyid
or
sherif
of
the
legitimate
house
of
koreysh
in
any
case
a
caliphate
at
cairo
is
a
possibility
which
we
must
contemplate
and
one
which
under
the
political
direction
and
sole
guarantee
of
england
but
enjoying
full
sovereignty
there
might
be
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
acceptable
to
mohammedans
and
not
unfavourable
to
english
interests
it
seems
to
me
however
that
it
would
be
but
a
arrangement
not
a
permanent
settlement
and
this
from
the
complexity
of
foreign
interests
in
egypt
which
would
keep
the
mohammedan
pontiff
there
under
restraints
irksome
to
the
religious
sense
of
mussulmans
it
would
be
in
fact
but
the
prelude
to
that
final
return
to
arabia
which
arabian
thought
if
no
other
destines
for
the
caliphate
the
sherif
of
mecca
would
hardly
tolerate
any
further
subjection
to
an
emir
el
mumenin
shorn
of
his
chief
attributes
of
power
and
unable
it
might
be
any
longer
to
enforce
his
authority
sooner
or
later
the
caliphate
in
some
form
or
another
would
return
to
its
original
seat
and
find
there
its
final
established
at
mecca
our
duty
of
protecting
the
head
of
the
mussulman
religion
would
be
comparatively
a
simple
one
hejaz
for
all
military
purposes
is
inaccessible
by
land
for
europeans
and
mecca
were
it
necessary
at
any
time
to
give
the
caliph
a
garrison
of
mussulman
troops
is
within
a
night
march
of
the
coast
in
arabia
no
christian
rights
need
vindication
nor
could
any
european
power
put
in
a
claim
of
interference
yemen
the
only
province
capable
of
attracting
european
speculation
would
i
know
gladly
accept
an
english
protectorate
such
as
has
been
already
given
with
such
good
results
to
oman
and
other
points
of
the
arabian
shore
might
equally
be
declared
inviolable
arabia
in
fact
might
be
declared
the
natural
appanage
of
the
caliphate
the
stati
pontificali
of
the
supreme
head
of
the
mussulman
religion
in
its
internal
organization
we
should
have
no
cause
to
interfere
nor
would
its
protection
from
without
involve
us
in
any
outlay
it
has
already
been
shown
how
favourable
an
action
an
arabian
caliphate
may
be
expected
to
exercise
on
the
progressive
thought
of
islam
that
it
could
not
be
a
hostile
power
to
england
is
equally
certain
whether
or
not
the
caliph
reside
at
mecca
the
grand
sherifate
must
always
there
exist
and
the
pilgrimage
be
continued
and
we
may
hope
the
latter
may
then
be
principally
under
english
auspices
the
regulation
of
the
haj
is
indeed
an
immediate
necessary
part
of
our
duty
and
condition
of
our
influence
in
the
mussulman
world
and
it
is
one
we
should
be
grossly
in
error
to
neglect
it
will
have
been
seen
by
the
table
given
in
the
first
chapter
that
nearly
the
whole
pilgrimage
to
arabia
is
now
made
by
sea
and
that
the
largest
number
of
pilgrims
sent
there
by
any
nation
comes
from
british
territory
with
the
protectorate
therefore
in
the
future
of
egypt
and
let
us
hope
of
syria
england
would
be
in
the
position
of
exercising
a
paramount
influence
on
the
commercial
fortune
of
the
holy
cities
the
revenue
of
hejaz
derived
from
the
haj
is
computed
at
three
millions
sterling
a
figure
proved
by
the
yearly
excess
of
imports
over
exports
in
her
seaports
for
she
produces
nothing
and
the
patronage
of
half
or
perhaps
of
this
great
revenue
would
make
england
a
position
there
quite
unassailable
an
interdiction
of
the
haj
or
the
threat
of
such
for
a
single
year
would
act
upon
every
purse
among
the
hejazi
and
neutralize
the
hostility
of
the
most
recalcitrant
of
resident
caliphs
or
sherifs
while
a
systematic
development
of
the
pilgrimage
as
a
government
undertaking
with
the
construction
of
a
railway
from
jeddah
to
mecca
and
the
establishment
of
thoroughly
lines
of
steamers
from
the
principal
mohammedan
ports
all
matters
which
would
amply
repay
their
cost
would
every
year
add
a
new
prestige
to
english
influence
this
might
be
still
further
enhanced
by
the
very
simple
measure
of
collecting
and
transmitting
officially
the
revenue
of
the
wakaf
property
entailed
on
the
sherifs
in
india
this
is
said
to
amount
to
half
a
million
sterling
and
might
as
in
turkey
take
the
form
of
a
government
subsidy
at
present
it
is
collected
privately
and
reaches
the
sherifs
reduced
as
i
have
been
told
by
in
the
process
of
collection
so
that
the
mere
assumption
of
this
perfectly
legitimate
duty
by
the
indian
authorities
would
put
a
large
sum
into
the
hands
of
those
in
office
at
mecca
and
a
proportionate
degree
of
power
into
the
hands
of
its
collectors
this
indeed
would
be
no
more
than
is
being
already
done
by
our
government
for
the
shia
shrines
of
kerbela
and
meshed
ali
with
results
entirely
beneficial
to
english
popularity
and
influence
with
regard
to
the
pilgrimage
i
will
venture
to
quote
the
opinion
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
and
loyal
mohammedans
in
india
who
has
lately
been
advocating
the
claims
of
his
on
the
indian
government
for
protection
in
this
and
other
matters
speaking
of
sultan
abd
el
hamid
schemes
which
he
asserts
have
not
as
yet
found
much
favour
in
india
he
continues
i
may
however
add
that
by
far
the
most
formidable
means
which
can
be
adopted
for
propagating
such
ideas
or
for
rousing
a
desire
for
islamic
union
would
be
the
distribution
of
pamphlets
to
the
pilgrims
at
mecca
the
annual
haj
at
mecca
draws
the
more
religious
from
all
parts
of
india
and
the
hajjis
on
their
return
are
treated
with
exceptional
respect
and
visited
by
their
friends
and
neighbours
who
naturally
inquire
about
the
latest
news
and
doctrines
propounded
in
the
holy
cities
so
that
for
the
dissemination
of
their
views
the
most
effective
way
would
be
for
the
propagandists
to
bring
the
hajjis
under
their
influence
i
call
it
because
the
influence
of
what
the
hajjis
say
goes
to
the
remotest
villages
of
the
mofussil
he
then
advocates
as
a
influence
the
undertaking
by
government
of
the
transport
of
the
haj
to
jeddah
and
the
appointment
of
an
agent
a
native
of
india
to
look
after
their
interests
while
in
the
holy
land
by
making
he
concludes
the
arrangements
i
have
suggested
the
english
government
will
gain
not
only
the
of
the
whole
mohammedan
population
of
india
but
they
will
also
inspire
the
hajjis
with
the
wholesome
feeling
that
they
owe
allegiance
to
and
can
claim
protection
from
an
empire
other
than
that
to
which
the
people
of
arabia
are
subject
the
turkish
the
proposed
help
would
stand
in
very
favourable
contrast
to
the
sufferings
which
the
pilgrims
undergo
from
maladministration
at
mecca
and
in
their
journey
to
medina
moreover
practically
the
assistance
rendered
by
the
government
would
be
the
most
effective
way
of
resisting
such
influences
as
the
propagandists
might
bring
to
bear
upon
the
hajjis
with
a
view
to
animate
them
with
hostility
to
the
british
supremacy
in
india
i
believe
if
the
indian
government
only
wished
to
make
some
such
arrangement
it
would
pay
its
own
way
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
it
would
have
a
disproportionately
beneficial
effect
on
the
political
feelings
of
the
mohammedans
towards
british
rule
such
or
some
such
is
the
line
of
action
which
england
looking
merely
to
her
own
interests
may
it
is
hoped
pursue
in
the
next
century
and
begin
in
this
her
asiatic
interests
she
must
recognize
to
be
peace
and
security
in
mussulman
india
in
egypt
and
the
healthy
growth
of
the
humaner
thought
of
islam
everywhere
and
these
she
can
only
secure
by
occupying
the
position
marked
out
for
her
by
providence
of
leading
the
mohammedan
world
in
its
advance
towards
better
things
the
mission
is
a
high
one
and
well
worthy
of
her
acceptance
and
the
means
at
her
disposal
are
fully
sufficient
for
its
discharge
nor
will
her
refusal
if
she
refuse
be
without
grave
and
immediate
danger
the
mohammedan
world
is
roused
as
it
has
never
been
in
its
history
to
a
sense
of
its
political
and
moral
dangers
and
is
looking
round
on
all
sides
for
a
leader
of
whatsoever
name
or
nation
to
espouse
its
cause
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
position
of
directing
so
vast
a
force
if
abandoned
by
england
will
be
claimed
by
some
more
resolute
neighbour
the
british
empire
in
asia
is
cause
of
envy
to
the
world
at
large
and
its
prosperity
has
many
enemies
who
will
certainly
make
the
distress
of
islam
an
engine
in
their
hands
against
it
neglected
by
the
power
which
they
hold
bound
to
protect
their
interest
the
mussulmans
of
india
will
certainly
become
its
bitterest
enemies
and
though
they
may
not
immediately
be
able
to
give
effect
to
their
hostility
the
day
of
embarrassment
for
us
can
hardly
fail
to
come
and
with
it
their
opportunity
at
best
the
enmity
of
islam
will
make
the
dream
of
reconciling
the
indian
populations
to
our
rule
for
ever
an
impossibility
leaders
they
will
look
for
elsewhere
in
russia
maybe
in
germany
or
even
france
jealous
of
our
interests
in
egypt
not
leaders
such
as
we
might
have
been
for
their
good
but
for
our
evil
and
in
pursuance
of
their
own
designs
the
caliphate
is
a
weapon
forged
for
any
hand
for
russia
at
bagdad
for
france
at
damascus
or
for
holland
call
it
one
day
germany
in
our
stead
at
mecca
protected
by
any
of
these
nations
the
caliphate
might
make
our
position
intolerable
in
india
filling
up
for
us
the
measure
of
mussulman
bitterness
of
which
we
already
are
having
a
foretaste
in
the
intrigues
at
constantinople
but
enough
of
this
line
of
reasoning
which
after
all
is
selfish
and
unworthy
the
main
point
is
that
england
should
fulfil
the
trust
she
has
accepted
of
developing
not
destroying
the
existing
elements
of
good
in
asia
she
can
not
destroy
islam
nor
dissolve
her
own
connection
with
her
therefore
in
god
name
let
her
take
islam
by
the
hand
and
encourage
her
boldly
in
the
path
of
virtue
this
is
the
only
worthy
course
and
the
only
wise
one
wiser
and
worthier
i
venture
to
assert
than
a
whole
century
of
crusade
in
conclusion
i
would
say
to
mohammedans
that
if
i
have
drawn
a
gloomy
picture
of
their
immediate
political
fortunes
it
is
not
that
i
despair
even
of
these
their
day
of
empire
in
the
world
seems
over
but
their
day
of
may
well
dawn
again
though
under
changed
conditions
from
any
we
now
witness
i
foresee
for
them
the
spiritual
inheritance
of
africa
and
southern
asia
and
as
the
intelligence
of
the
races
they
convert
shall
have
risen
to
the
level
of
their
present
rulers
and
europe
weary
of
her
work
shall
have
abandoned
the
task
of
asiatic
and
african
government
the
temporal
inheritance
too
how
long
this
shall
be
delayed
we
know
not
their
prophet
has
foretold
that
islam
shall
not
outlive
two
thousand
years
before
the
móhdy
shall
come
and
the
thirteen
hundredth
is
just
commencing
nor
do
i
believe
their
deliverance
will
be
so
very
long
delayed
a
man
of
justice
may
yet
restore
their
fortunes
but
it
will
hardly
be
by
present
violence
or
by
wading
to
mecca
through
seas
of
blood
and
when
the
end
of
their
humiliation
shall
have
come
it
may
be
found
that
his
true
mission
has
commenced
already
and
that
the
battle
he
was
to
fight
has
been
long
waging
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
have
striven
to
reform
their
ways
and
purify
their
law
rather
than
lament
their
broken
power
and
the
corrupt
vanities
of
their
temporal
empire
the
end
footnotes
the
arabs
believe
that
the
beni
ghassan
the
christian
bedouin
tribe
which
opposed
the
caliph
omar
migrated
to
great
britain
on
the
mohammedan
conquest
of
syria
since
this
was
written
astonishing
evidence
of
political
vitality
has
been
given
to
europe
by
egypt
and
there
is
now
i
trust
little
doubt
that
she
will
be
left
to
work
out
her
salvation
in
her
own
way
the
phenomenon
opens
too
large
a
vista
to
the
imagination
to
be
treated
of
in
a
note
but
the
author
would
invite
attention
to
it
as
a
fact
worthy
of
more
consideration

all
his
arguments
