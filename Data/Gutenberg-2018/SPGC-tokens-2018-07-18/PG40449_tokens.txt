brimful

marsh
is
a
humorist
who
is
genuinely
for
pure
amusement
we
have
not
of
late
met
anything
to
equal
the
title
is
a
little
misleading
for
the
careless

imagine
the

contain
nothing

trifles

the

skill
their

is
irresistible

an
agony
it
caught
my
eye
at
once
when
a
man
is
dining
off
his
last
he
is
apt
to
have
his
eyes
wide
open
having
just
disposed
of
a
steak
which
under
the
circumstances
did
not
seem
to
be
so
large
as
it
might
have
been
i
picked
up
a
paper
which
as
he
had
laid
it
down
the
diner
in
front
appeared
to
have
done
with
as
it
was
folded
the
agony
column
stared
me
in
the
face
and
among
the
agonies
was
this
if
james
southam
at
one
time
of
dulborough
will
apply
to
the
undersigned
he
will
hear
of
something
to
his

bacup
street
london
now
i
am
james
southam
at
one
time
of
dulborough
but
although
i
do
answer
to
that
description
a
very
clear
something
told
me
that
if
i
did
hear
of
anything
to
my
advantage
by
applying
to
anybody
then
the
age
of
miracles
was
not
yet
done
with
still
as
when
a
man
has
spent
on
a
doubtful
meal
out
of
his
last
something
to
his
advantage
is
exactly
what
he
wants
to
hear
of
i
clipped
that
advertisement
out
of
the
paper
under
the
waiter
nose
and
put
it
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
on
referring
to
a
directory
in
a
convenient
i
found
that
bacup
street
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
old
kent
road
that
did
not
seem
to
be
a
promising
address
and
so
far
as
appearances
went
it
fulfilled
its
promise
it
struck
me
that
bacup
street
speaking
generally
looked
more
than
a
trifle
out
at
elbows
and
number
thirteen
seemed
to
be
the
shabbiest
house
which
it
contained
an
untidy
youth
received
me
after
keeping
me
waiting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
what
might
have
served
as
an
apology
for
a
cupboard
he
ushered
me
into
a
room
beyond
in
this
inner
room
there
were
two
men
one
was
seated
at
a
table
the
other
was
standing
with
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
in
front
of
the
empty
fireplace
they
looked
at
me
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
they
exchanged
a
glance
of
surprise
the
man
at
the
table
addressed
me
without
evincing
any
desire
to
rise
well
sir
and
what
can
we
do
for
you
that
i
said
is
what
i
want
to
know
the
man
smiled
as
if
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
there
was
anything
to
smile
at
i
took
the
newspaper
cutting
out
of
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
have
just
seen
this
advertisement
i
am
james
southam
at
one
time
of
dulborough
and
if
you
are
cleaver
and
caxton
i
have
come
to
you
to
hear
of
something
to
my
advantage
for
some
moments
my
words
remained
unanswered
they
both
stared
at
me
as
if
they
were
endeavouring
by
mere
force
of
visual
inspection
to
find
out
what
sort
of
person
i
really
was
then
the
man
at
the
table
spoke
again
of
course
you
have
evidence
as
to
the
truth
of
what
you
say
i
have
my
card
in
my
pocket
here
are
letters
which
have
been
addressed
to
me
if
you
will
tell
me
what
i
am
going
to
hear
of
to
my
advantage
i
will
place
you
in
the
way
of
obtaining
a
sufficiency
of
any
sort
of
evidence
you
may
require
i
placed
a
card
on
the
table
and
some
old
envelopes
having
first
of
all
taken
out
the
letters
the
two
men
forgathered
they
examined
my
documents
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
whispers
holding
out
one
of
the
envelopes
the
man
who
had
already
spoken
pointed
with
a
stubby
and
unclean
first
finger
to
the
address
which
was
on
the
front
of
it
is
this
your
present
address
no
at
present
i
have
no
address
what
do
you
mean
i
have
been
presented
with
the
key
of
the
street
do
you
mean
that
you
are
impecunious
i
do
the
individual
with
the
hat
on
who
had
not
yet
spoken
to
me
spoke
to
me
now
with
a
decidedly
unpleasant
grin
he
said
i
did
not
like
to
turn
myself
to
strangers
especially
to
such
strangers
but
i
had
recently
had
to
do
a
good
many
things
which
i
had
not
liked
above
all
i
had
begun
to
realise
the
truth
of
the
adage
which
tells
us
that
beggars
must
not
be
choosers
i
am
as
nearly
as
a
man
can
be
who
is
in
possession
of
a
fair
variety
of
the
clothes
he
stands
up
in
and
elevenpence
in
cash
there
was
some
further
whispering
between
the
pair
then
the
individual
with
the
hat
on
addressed
me
again
if
you
will
step
outside
in
a
few
minutes
we
will
speak
to
you
again
i
stepped
outside
they
kept
me
outside
longer
than
i
altogether
relished
i
was
on
the
point
of
at
all
hazards
asserting
my
dignity
when
the
man
with
the
hat
on
opening
the
door
of
the
inner
office
invited
me
to
enter
it
was
he
when
i
entered
who
took
up
the
conversation
we
are
not
you
must
understand
at
liberty
to
furnish
you
with
particulars
of
the
matter
referred
to
in
our
advertisement
without
first
of
all
communicating
with
our
client
who
is
your
client
that
without
having
received
permission
we
can
not
tell
you
either
can
you
not
guess
the
fellow
stared
at
me
in
a
manner
which
i
instinctively
resented
his
glance
conveyed
a
meaning
which
seemed
to
be
the
reverse
of
flattering
i
certainly
can
not
guess
nor
have
i
the
least
intention
of
trying
i
have
the
pleasure
of
wishing
you
i
turned
to
go
the
fellow
stopped
me
one
moment
where
are
you
off
to
i
turned
to
him
again
this
time
he
was
eyeing
me
with
what
i
felt
was
an
insolent
grin
for
a
man
in
the
position
in
which
you
say
you
are
you
do
seem
over
anxious
to
hear
of
something
to
your
advantage
nor
do
you
seem
over
anxious
to
tell
it
me
we
are
solicitors
man
not
principals
it
is
our
business
to
act
on
the
instructions
we
have
received
listen
to
me
i
listened
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
our
client
would
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
your
address
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
place
himself
in
immediate
communication
with
you
should
you
turn
out
to
be
the
james
southam
he
is
in
search
of
as
you
do
appear
at
present
to
have
an
address
of
your
own
we
are
willing
to
provide
you
with
one
explain
yourself
we
will
take
you
to
an
hotel
and
we
will
guarantee
your
reasonable
expenses
there
until
you
hear
from
us
again
should
you
not
turn
out
to
be
the
required
james
southam
we
will
pay
your
bill
withdraw
our
guarantee
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
you
will
have
received
some
advantage
at
any
rate
i
accepted
the
proposition
when
the
sum
of
elevenpence
stands
between
a
man
and
starvation
he
is
apt
not
to
be
over
particular
in
picking
holes
in
proffered
offers
of
board
and
lodging
the
untidy
youth
fetched
a
cab
the
individual
with
the
hat
on
accompanied
me
in
it
there
and
then
to
one
of
those
innumerable
private
hotels
which
are
found
in
the
side
streets
off
the
strand
he
went
inside
while
i
waited
for
him
in
the
cab
when
he
reappeared
he
fetched
me
in
introduced
me
to
a
tall
thin
woman
whom
he
called
barnes
drew
me
aside
told
me
that
he
had
made
all
arrangements
that
i
should
hear
from
him
again
and
that
in
the
meantime
i
should
find
myself
all
right
then
he
went
leaving
me
in
that
private
hotel
for
all
i
knew
to
the
contrary
a
pensioner

his

chapter
ii
the
waiter
and
the
hand
when
i
had
dined
they
gave
me
for
nothing
a
better
dinner
than
the
one
i
had
had
in
the
middle
of
the
day
for
the
feeling
that
to
say
the
least
of
it
i
was
in
an
equivocal
position
began
to
chasten
instead
i
began
to
feel
as
the
schoolboys
have
it
that
i
was
in
for
a
lark
that
i
really
was
going
to
hear
either
through
cleaver
and
caxton
or
through
anybody
else
of
something
to
my
advantage
i
never
for
a
moment
believed
i
was
an
orphan
i
had
what
i
take
it
are
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
i
have
not
a
single
living
relative
i
have
no
friends
i
never
had
i
was
at
my
mother
death
employed
in
an
office
from
which
i
was
shortly
after
ignominiously
ejected
owing
to
a
difference
of
opinion
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
with
the
senior
clerk
i
had
spent
my
substance
such
as
it
was
and
twelve
months
in
seeking
for
other
occupation
my
story
was
a
prosaic
and
a
sordid
one
that
i
could
hear
of
something
to
my
advantage
from
any
source
whatever
was
an
idea
i
utterly
scouted
i
dined
alone
the
waiter
informed
me
that
for
the
moment
i
was
the
only
visitor
in
the
house
no
doubt
under
those
circumstances
i
was
welcome
this
waiter
was
a
man
with
hair
and
a
pair
of
curiously
big
black
eyes
i
noticed
them
as
he
flitted
about
the
room
but
i
had
much
better
reason
to
notice
them
a
little
later
on
as
i
rose
from
the
table
i
gave
outspoken
utterance
to
words
which
were
a
sort
of
tag
to
the
sequence
of
my
thoughts
well
james
southam
i
exclaimed
you
in
for
it
at
last
this
i
said
out
loud
foolishly
no
doubt
the
waiter
was
moving
towards
the
door
he
had
some
plates
in
his
hand
as
i
spoke
he
dropped
these
plates
they
smashed
to
pieces
on
the
floor
he
turned
to
me
as
if
he
turned
on
a
pivot
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
changed
he
glared
at
me
as
if
i
or
he
had
suddenly
gone
mad
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
dilated
it
was
then
i
realised
what
curious
eyes
they
were
who
the
devil
are
you
he
cried
how
do
you
know
my
name
james
southam
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
a
splash
of
inspiration
seemed
all
at
once
to
come
to
me
i
do
not
know
from
where
you
are
james
southam
i
said
at
one
time
of
dulborough
i
could
plainly
see
that
the
man
was
trembling
either
with
fear
or
with
rage
and
it
struck
me
that
it
was
with
a
mixture
of
both
what
has
that
to
do
with
you
he
gasped
it
has
this
to
do
with
me
that
i
want
you
an
empty
was
on
the
table
with
the
rapidity
of
some
frantic
wild
animal
rushing
forward
he
caught
this
bottle
by
the
neck
and
before
i
had
realised
his
intention
he
struck
me
with
it
on
the
head
he
was
a
smaller
man
than
i
but
when
next
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
things
of
this
world
i
was
lying
on
the
floor
and
the
room
was
empty
my
namesake
all
the
evidence
went
to
show
had
felled
me
like
a
log
and
without
any
sort
of
ceremony
had
left
me
where
i
fell
i
sat
up
on
the
floor
i
put
my
hand
to
my
head
it
ached
so
badly
that
i
could
scarcely
see
out
of
my
eyes
with
some
difficulty
i
sprang
to
my
feet
on
attaining
a
more
or
less
upright
position
i
became
conscious
that
the
trepidation
of
my
legs
inclined
me
in
another
direction
if
this
i
told
myself
is
hearing
of
something
to
my
advantage
i
heard
enough
as
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
support
by
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
the
room
door
opened
and
the
tall
thin
woman
whom
i
had
been
told
was
barnes
came
in
i
beg
your
pardon
she
began
she
looked
round
the
room
then
she
looked
at
me
so
far
as
i
could
judge
in
the
then
state
of
my
faculties
she
appeared
surprised
i
thought
the
waiter
was
here
he
was
here
how
long
has
he
been
gone
some
minutes
it
is
very
odd
i
have
been
looking
for
him
everywhere
i
thought
that
he
was
still
upstairs
with
you
she
glanced
at
the
ruined
crockery
what
has
happened
who
has
broken
the
plates
the
waiter
he
dropped
them
he
also
dropped
the
bottle
i
did
not
explain
that
he
had
dropped
the
latter
on
my
head
and
almost
broken
it
into
as
many
pieces
as
the
plates
it
is
very
careless
of
him
i
must
see
where
he
is
i
fancied
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that
she
perceived
that
there
was
more
in
the
matter
than
met
the
eye
but
if
so
she
did
not
give
audible
expression
to
her
perceptions
she
left
the
room
and
when
she
had
gone
i
also
left
the
room
and
went
to
bed
i
realised
that
the
complications
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
the
ramifications
of
the
situation
were
for
the
moment
beyond
my
grasp
in
the
morning
i
might
be
able
to
look
the
position
fairly
in
the
face
but
just
then
no
i
hastened
to
put
myself
between
the
sheets
scarcely
was
i
between
them
than
i
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
as
it
seemed
to
me
just
after
i
had
fallen
asleep
by
some
one
knocking
at
the
bedroom
door
the
knocking
must
have
startled
me
out
of
a
dreamless
slumber
because
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
i
could
remember
where
i
was
then
i
understood
that
some
one
was
endeavouring
to
attract
my
attention
from
without
who
there
i
said
it
is
i
barnes
the
landlady
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
what
now
what
time
is
it
wo
the
morning
do
no
i
must
speak
to
you
at
once
it
seemed
that
in
my
hurry
to
get
into
bed
i
had
forgotten
to
put
the
gas
out
slipping
into
some
garments
i
opened
the
door
there
stood
barnes
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
for
some
cause
or
other
she
was
in
a
state
of
unmistakable
uneasiness
she
looked
white
and
haggard
i
can
not
find
the
waiter
she
said
you
can
not
find
the
waiter
i
stared
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
if
you
want
to
find
him
but
may
i
ask
what
that
has
to
do
with
me
i
believe
it
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
you
what
took
place
between
you
in
the
really
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
took
place
between
us
in
the
that
was
of
interest
to
you
she
came
a
step
forward
raising
the
lighted
candle
she
almost
thrust
it
in
my
face
she
stared
at
me
with
strained
and
eager
eyes
she
seemed
to
see
something
in
my
face
though
what
there
was
to
see
except
bewilderment
was
more
than
i
could
guess
i
do
believe
you
you
are
deceiving
me
did
you
quarrel
with
him
who
are
you
tell
me
i
have
a
right
to
know
i
am
his
wife
his
wife
complications
seemed
to
be
increasing
i
thought
your
name
was
barnes
so
is
his
name
barnes
what
has
happened
what
do
you
know
about
him
tell
me
what
do
i
know
about
him
i
know
nothing
so
far
as
i
am
aware
i
never
saw
the
man
in
my
life
before
i
do
believe
you
you
are
lying
where
has
he
gone
and
why
you
shall
tell
me
i
make
you
she
forced
her
way
into
the
room
in
doing
so
she
forced
me
back
when
she
was
in
she
shut
the
door
and
stood
with
her
back
to
it
her
voice
had
risen
to
a
scream
her
manner
almost
threatened
personal
violence
i
felt
that
the
hotel
to
which
i
had
been
introduced
was
conducted
on
lines
with
which
i
had
not
been
hitherto
familiar
if
as
you
say
and
as
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
this
person
is
your
husband
and
he
has
really
disappeared
i
can
understand
that
your
excitement
is
not
unjustified
but
you
are
mistaken
if
you
suppose
that
i
am
in
any
way
to
blame
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
between
us
i
turned
aside
so
that
i
might
have
some
sort
of
chance
of
making
up
my
mind
as
to
how
much
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
might
be
advisable
to
tell
her
your
husband
waited
on
me
at
dinner
during
dinner
we
scarcely
exchanged
half
a
dozen
words
after
dinner
i
said
something
which
although
it
was
spoken
out
loud
was
said
to
myself
but
which
affected
him
in
the
most
extraordinary
and
unexpected
manner
what
did
you
say
i
said
want
you
you
said
want
you
the
woman
gave
a
sort
of
nervous
clutch
at
the
door
behind
her
are
you
a
policeman
i
am
nothing
of
the
kind
you
ought
to
know
better
than
i
what
your
husband
has
on
his
conscience
i
can
only
suppose
that
for
some
cause
he
stands
in
terror
of
the
officers
of
the
law
because
no
sooner
had
i
innocently
uttered
what
i
believe
is
a
regular
policeman
formula
than
without
a
word
of
warning
he
caught
up
the
empty
bottle
which
was
on
the
table
like
a
madman
and
knocked
me
down
with
it
knocked
you
down
with
it
the
woman
face
was
as
white
as
her
own
sheets
i
saw
that
she
needed
the
support
of
the
door
to
aid
her
stand
you
said
nothing
to
me
when
i
came
in
i
was
so
astounded
by
the
man
behaviour
and
so
stunned
by
his
violence
that
i
was
not
in
a
fit
state
for
saying
anything
i
intended
to
wait
till
the
morning
and
then
have
it
out
both
with
you
and
with
him
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
i
am
so
i
was
though
i
might
not
have
been
telling
all
of
it
i
appeared
to
have
told
enough
of
it
for
her
because
immediately
afterwards
she
departed
unless
i
err
not
much
easier
in
her
mind
because
of
the
visit
she
had
paid
to
me
in
the
morning
as
might
have
been
expected
i
woke
with
a
headache
i
did
not
feel
in
the
best
of
health
either
physical
or
mental
when
i
went
down
to
breakfast
that
meal
was
served
by
a
maidservant
bringing
in
a
letter
on
a
waiter
she
asked
if
it
was
for
me
as
it
was
addressed
to
me
by
name
james
southam
i
not
only
claimed
i
opened
it
it
contained
a
letter
and
some
enclosures
here
is
the
letter
word
for
word
dear
sir
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
from
cleaver
and
caxton
acquainting
me
with
your
address
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
write
to
you
i
am
just
now
detained
by
business
but
i
hope
to
call
on
you
at
the
very
earliest
opportunity
at
latest
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
i
assure
you
that
it
will
be
greatly
to
your
advantage
as
some
slight
guarantee
of
this
i
beg
your
acceptance
of
the
enclosed
you
need
have
no
fear
you
will
find
in
me
in
all
respects
a
friend
i
will
let
you
know
by
telegram
when
i
am
coming
until
then
believe
me
your
sincere
duncan
rothwell
the
enclosed
took
the
shape
of
four
who
duncan
rothwell
was
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
to
me
the
name
was
wholly
unfamiliar
the
letter
was
neither
addressed
nor
dated
the
on
the
envelope
was
manchester
cleaver
and
caxton
must
have
telegraphed
so
soon
as
i
had
left
them
and
clearly
rothwell
had
written
immediately
on
receipt
of
their
wire
the
letter
was
fairly
worded
but
something
about
the
writing
and
indeed
about
the
whole
get
up
of
the
thing
suggested
that
it
had
not
been
written
by
a
highly
educated
man
a
gentleman
in
any
case
it
seemed
sufficiently
clear
that
it
was
not
intended
for
me
until
fingering
the
thing
and
turning
it
over
and
over
i
chanced
to
open
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
it
was
written
it
was
a
large
sheet
of
business
the
communication
was
all
contained
on
the
front
page
and
as
there
was
still
plenty
of
room
to
spare
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
there
could
be
additions
say
for
instance
in
the
shape
of
a
postscript
it
was
by
the
purest
chance
that
my
fidgety
fingers
pulled
the
sheet
wide
open
so
soon
as
they
had
done
so
i
perceived
that
i
was
wrong
in
the
middle
of
the
third
page
was
this
it
was
with
great
regret
that
i
heard
of
your
mother
lamented
death
at
putney
i
had
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
visiting
her
grave
in
wandsworth
cemetery
this
will
facilitate
matters
greatly
then
the
letter
was
intended
for
me
after
all
my
mother
had
died
at
putney
she
had
been
buried
in
wandsworth
cemetery
there
might
although
i
had
not
been
aware
of
it
have
been
two
james
southams
in
dulborough
the
coincidence
was
credible
but
it
was
scarcely
credible
that
the
other
james
southam
mother
could
also
have
died
at
putney
and
have
been
buried
in
wandsworth
cemetery
why
or
in
what
sense
my
mother
death
might
facilitate
matters
was
more
than
i
could
say
but
in
the
face
of
that
postscript
there
still
seemed
sufficient
doubt
as
to
which
james
southam
was
about
to
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
to
justify
me
in
remaining
where
i
was
and
allowing
events
to
take
their
course
as
i
was
standing
at
the
window
meditating
whether
or
not
i
should
go
for
a
stroll
the
maidservant
appeared
with
a
message
barnes
compliments
and
if
you
are
at
liberty
could
she
speak
to
you
in
the
private
parlour
i
was
not
anxious
to
see
barnes
i
had
a
suspicion
that
if
i
was
not
careful
i
might
become
more
involved
than
was
desirable
in
her
private
affairs
still
if
i
remained
in
her
house
i
could
scarcely
avoid
speaking
to
her
my
impulse
was
to
go
to
cleaver
and
caxton
and
ask
them
to
shift
my
quarters
but
they
might
decline
and
well
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
went
and
spoke
to
her
the
private
parlour
proved
to
be
a
small
room
and
a
stuffy
one
barnes
received
me
on
the
threshold
she
opened
the
door
to
permit
me
to
enter
and
having
followed
me
in
she
shut
it
behind
us
he
has
not
returned
she
said
you
mean
i
mean
my
husband
frankly
i
think
it
is
almost
as
well
that
he
should
not
have
returned
at
least
while
i
remain
an
inmate
of
your
house
you
can
scarcely
expect
me
to
pass
over
his
extraordinary
behaviour
in
silence
she
stood
staring
at
me
in
that
strained
eager
manner
which
i
had
noticed
overnight
her
hands
were
clasped
in
front
of
her
her
fingers
were
twisting
and
untwisting
themselves
in
what
seemed
pure
nervousness
i
have
been
married
to
barnes
twelve
months
as
she
paused
i
nodded
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
i
have
regretted
it
ever
since
there
is
a
mystery
about
him
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
there
is
a
good
deal
about
him
which
is
mysterious
to
me
but
whether
it
is
equally
mysterious
to
you
is
another
question
he
is
a
mystery
to
me
he
always
has
been
she
paused
again
she
drew
in
her
lips
as
if
to
moisten
them
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
but
i
want
a
confidant
i
must
speak
to
some
one
i
beg
that
you
will
not
make
a
confidant
of
me
i
do
assure
you
as
she
interrupted
me
her
voice
rose
almost
to
a
scream
i
must
speak
to
you
i
will
i
can
endure
no
longer
sit
down
and
let
me
speak
to
you
perceiving
that
unless
i
made
a
scene
i
should
have
to
let
her
at
least
say
something
i
did
as
she
requested
and
sat
down
i
wished
that
she
would
sit
down
also
instead
of
standing
in
front
of
the
door
twisting
her
hands
and
her
body
and
pulling
faces
for
only
so
can
i
describe
what
seemed
to
be
the
nervous
spasms
which
were
continually
causing
her
to
distort
her
attenuated
countenance
i
never
wished
to
marry
him
she
began
he
made
me
i
suppose
you
mean
that
he
made
you
in
the
sense
in
which
all
ladies
when
their
time
comes
are
made
to
marry
no
i
do
i
never
wanted
to
marry
him
never
he
was
almost
as
great
a
stranger
to
me
as
you
are
why
should
i
marry
a
perfect
stranger
without
a
penny
to
his
name
me
who
had
been
a
single
woman
and
content
to
be
a
single
woman
for
nearly
forty
years
i
could
not
tell
her
i
am
sure
i
had
no
this
house
belongs
to
me
it
was
my
mother
house
before
me
he
came
in
one
day
and
asked
me
if
i
wanted
a
waiter
came
in
with
hardly
a
shoe
to
his
foot
it
was
like
his
impudence
i
did
not
want
a
waiter
and
i
told
him
so
but
he
mesmerised
me
and
made
me
have
him
mesmerised
you
barnes
you
are
joking
i
not
joking
to
do
her
justice
any
one
who
looked
less
like
joking
i
never
saw
i
always
been
a
nervous
sort
of
a
body
directly
he
saw
me
he
could
do
anything
he
liked
with
me
he
was
always
mesmerising
me
in
less
than
a
month
he
had
mesmerised
me
into
marrying
him
as
soon
as
we
were
married
i
began
to
think
that
he
was
mad
in
that
case
i
told
myself
that
most
promising
couple
must
have
been
something
very
like
a
pair
he
was
always
asking
me
if
i
would
like
to
sell
myself
to
the
devil
he
used
to
say
that
he
would
arrange
it
for
me
if
i
wanted
then
he
used
to
dream
out
loud
such
dreams
night
after
night
i
lain
and
listened
to
him
frightened
half
out
of
my
wits
then
he
took
to
walking
in
his
sleep
the
only
thing
he
brought
into
the
place
was
a
little
wooden
box
tied
up
in
a
i
never
could
make
out
what
was
in
this
box
once
when
i
asked
him
i
thought
he
would
have
killed
me
one
night
in
the
middle
of
a
dream
he
got
out
of
bed
and
went
downstairs
although
i
was
so
frightened
that
my
knees
were
knocking
together
i
went
after
him
he
came
in
here
this
box
of
his
was
in
that
bureau
it
in
that
bureau
now
she
pointed
to
a
tall
bureau
which
was
just
behind
my
chair
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
all
the
time
i
could
not
catch
all
that
he
said
he
spoke
so
low
but
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
something
about
the
devil
he
took
this
box
of
his
out
of
the
bureau
he
did
something
to
it
with
his
hands
what
he
did
i
do
know
i
suppose
there
was
a
secret
spring
about
it
or
something
but
though
i
tried
to
make
it
out
over
and
over
again
since
then
i
never
been
able
to
find
the
secret
of
it
to
this
day
when
he
handled
it
the
top
flew
open
he
put
the
box
down
upon
that
table
and
i
stood
watching
him
in
the
open
doorway
just
about
where
i
am
standing
now
without
his
having
the
least
notion
i
was
there
i
believe
that
if
he
had
known
he
would
have
killed
me
do
you
mean
to
say
while
he
was
doing
all
you
have
described
that
he
was
asleep
fast
asleep
you
are
quite
sure
barnes
that
you
also
were
not
fast
asleep
not
me
i
almost
wish
i
had
been
i
never
had
a
good
night
sleep
from
that
hour
to
this
i
grown
that
thin
for
want
of
it
that
nothing
but
a
skeleton
as
i
was
saying
when
he
had
opened
it
he
put
the
box
down
on
the
table
he
gave
a
laugh
which
made
my
blood
run
cold
she
struck
me
as
being
the
sort
of
woman
whose
blood
on
very
slight
provocation
would
run
then
he
took
something
out
of
the
box
when
i
saw
what
it
was
i
thought
i
should
have
fainted
a
nervous
paroxysm
seemed
to
pass
all
over
her
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
it
was
a
woman
finger
a
woman
finger
mrs
barnes
it
was
a
woman
finger
there
was
a
on
it
it
was
too
small
for
the
finger
so
that
the
ring
seemed
to
have
eaten
into
the
flesh
he
stood
staring
at
this
what
staring
and
he
was
fast
asleep
i
do
know
much
about
he
was
the
first
i
ever
saw
and
i
hope
he
be
the
last
but
i
do
know
that
when
he
was
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
used
to
stare
at
things
which
i
suppose
he
wanted
to
see
in
a
way
which
was
horrible
to
look
at
it
was
like
that
he
stared
at
this
then
he
said
right
out
loud
cut
you
off
one
of
these
fine
days
and
see
how
you
look
upon
my
finger
then
he
put
the
finger
down
on
the
table
and
out
of
the
box
he
took
three
other
fingers
and
a
thumb
you
are
quite
sure
they
were
real
genuine
human
fingers
mrs
barnes
i
know
fingers
when
i
see
them
i
suppose
you
hear
me
out
he
placed
them
on
the
table
nails
uppermost
close
together
just
as
the
fingers
are
upon
your
own
hand
he
spoke
to
them
never
play
any
more
of
your
devil
tricks
with
me
that
a
certainty
he
said
and
he
leered
and
grinned
and
chuckled
more
like
a
demon
than
a
man
then
he
took
something
out
of
the
box
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
calico
i
saw
that
on
the
calico
there
were
stains
of
blood
out
of
it
he
took
the
palm
of
a
woman
hand
raising
it
to
his
lips
he
kissed
it
looking
like
the
perfect
devil
that
he
was
he
put
it
down
palm
downwards
on
the
table
and
he
did
something
to
the
fingers
then
barnes
gave
utterance
to
a
gasping
sound
which
it
did
not
do
one
good
to
hear
he
picked
it
up
and
i
saw
that
by
some
trickery
he
had
joined
the
separate
parts
together
and
made
it
look
as
if
it
were
a
perfect
hand
she
stopped
i
do
not
mind
owning
that
if
i
had
had
my
way
she
would
have
stopped
for
good
unfortunately
i
did
not
see
my
way
to
compel
her
to
leave
her
tale
unfinished
i
suppose
that
at
that
dreadful
sight
i
must
have
fainted
because
the
next
thing
i
can
remember
is
finding
myself
lying
on
the
floor
and
the
room
all
dark
for
some
time
i
dared
scarcely
breathe
far
less
move
i
did
not
know
where
my
husband
might
be
how
i
summoned
up
courage
to
enable
me
to
creep
upstairs
to
this
hour
i
do
not
know
when
i
did
i
found
my
husband
fast
asleep
in
bed
you
really
must
excuse
my
asking
barnes
but
do
you
happen
to
recollect
what
you
ate
for
supper
that
night
and
are
you
in
the
habit
of
suffering
from
nightmare
nightmare
that
was
the
first
time
i
watched
him
i
have
watched
him
over
and
over
again
since
then
i
soon
found
out
that
regularly
every
friday
night
he
walked
in
his
sleep
and
went
downstairs
and
gloated
over
that
dreadful
hand
you
say
that
he
did
this
every
friday
are
you
suggesting
that
with
him
friday
was
some
sort
of
anniversary
i
do
know
what
was
i
to
think
what
was
any
one
to
think
laugh
at
me
do
you
think
i
am
a
fool
or
lying
you
shall
see
the
hand
for
yourself
and
tell
me
what
you
make
of
it
i
will
show
it
you
if
i
have
to
break
his
box
open
with
a
hammer
in
a
state
of
considerable
and
evident
excitement
she
crossed
the
room
i
rose
to
enable
her
to
approach
the
bureau
she
took
a
small
canvas
bag
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
dress
out
of
this
bag
she
took
some
keys
he
has
my
keys
he
made
me
give
him
them
he
never
knew
that
i
had
duplicates
but
i
always
have
had
he
seldom
went
outside
the
front
door
i
think
he
was
afraid
of
being
seen
in
the
streets
whenever
he
did
go
i
used
to
lock
myself
in
here
and
try
to
find
the
spring
which
opened
the
box
i
had
an
idea
that
there
might
be
something
in
it
which
i
had
not
seen
i
will
open
it
now
if
i
have
to
smash
it
into
splinters
she
let
down
the
flap
of
the
bureau
within
there
were
nests
of
drawers
and
one
small
centre
cupboard
this
cupboard
she
unlocked
when
she
had
done
so
she
gave
a
stifled
exclamation
it
has
gone
she
said
i
stooped
beside
her
what
has
gone
she
turned
to
me
a
face
which
was
ghastly
in
its
revelation
of
abject
terror
her
voice
had
suddenly
degenerated
into
a
sort
of
panting
hiss
the
box
it
was
here
last
night
after
he
had
gone
i
unlocked
the
bureau
and
i
looked
and
saw
it
was
there
she
caught
me
by
the
arm
she
gripped
me
with
a
strength
of
which
in
her
normal
condition
i
should
imagine
her
incapable
he
must
have
come
back
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
taken
it
he
may
be
hidden
somewhere
in
the
house
this
moment
oh
my
god
chapter
iii
the
man
in
the
doorway
i
called
at
cleaver
and
caxton
to
ask
what
i
should
do
with
the
four
notes
which
had
arrived
in
the
letter
the
individual
who
had
taken
me
to
the
hotel
was
the
only
person
in
the
office
it
seemed
from
his
own
statement
that
he
was
cleaver
the
senior
partner
when
he
learned
why
i
had
come
he
laughed
do
with
them
why
spend
them
or
throw
them
into
the
river
or
give
them
to
me
i
hesitated
the
truth
is
the
situation
threatened
to
become
too
complicated
i
had
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
the
something
which
james
southam
was
to
hear
of
might
be
something
to
his
exceeding
disadvantage
i
had
heard
enough
of
that
sort
of
thing
of
late
i
did
not
wish
to
stand
in
somebody
else
shoes
for
the
sake
of
hearing
more
i
resolved
to
have
some
sort
of
understanding
with
cleaver
who
is
duncan
rothwell
is
he
the
client
for
whom
you
are
acting
cleaver
was
occupying
himself
in
tearing
a
piece
of
paper
into
tiny
shreds
with
his
fingers
he
replied
to
my
question
with
another
why
do
you
ask
because
the
signature
attached
to
the
letter
which
brought
the
is
duncan
rothwell
and
as
to
my
knowledge
i
know
no
duncan
rothwell
i
should
like
to
know
who
duncan
rothwell
is
do
you
mind
my
looking
at
the
letter
i
did
not
mind
i
let
him
look
at
it
he
read
it
through
if
you
will
take
a
hint
from
me
southam
i
think
i
should
advise
you
to
restrain
your
not
unnatural
curiosity
and
wait
for
things
to
take
their
course
but
unless
i
am
careful
i
may
find
myself
in
a
false
position
i
may
not
be
the
required
james
southam
in
fact
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
do
believe
i
am
i
am
acquainted
with
no
duncan
rothwell
his
whole
letter
is
double
dutch
to
me
there
may
be
dozens
of
james
southams
about
recent
inhabitants
of
dulborough
i
thought
dulborough
was
a
mere
hamlet
so
it
is
how
long
did
you
live
there
i
was
born
and
bred
in
the
place
have
you
any
relatives
of
your
own
name
i
have
not
a
relative
in
the
world
if
as
you
say
you
were
born
and
bred
in
such
a
place
as
dulborough
i
presume
that
you
had
some
knowledge
of
the
inhabitants
i
believe
i
knew
something
of
every
creature
in
all
the
country
side
and
did
you
know
anything
of
another
james
southam
that
is
the
queer
part
of
it
so
far
as
i
know
i
was
the
only
southam
thereabouts
cleaver
laughed
according
to
your
own
statement
it
appears
that
to
put
it
mildly
there
is
at
least
a
possibility
of
your
being
the
james
southam
we
have
been
instructed
to
find
frankly
southam
we
know
very
little
more
about
the
matter
than
you
do
yourself
we
have
simply
been
instructed
to
discover
the
present
address
of
james
southam
at
one
time
of
dulborough
and
we
have
done
so
is
that
the
case
from
their
manner
the
day
before
i
had
suspected
that
cleaver
and
caxton
might
be
merely
as
it
were
lay
figures
and
that
it
was
somebody
else
who
held
the
strings
there
is
something
else
i
should
like
to
mention
i
wish
to
change
my
hotel
cleaver
stared
change
your
hotel
why
is
it
good
enough
it
is
not
that
exactly
it
is
the
domestic
arrangements
which
are
not
to
my
taste
the
domestic
arrangements
what
do
you
mean
i
did
not
know
how
to
explain
or
rather
i
did
not
know
how
much
to
explain
what
do
you
know
of
barnes
husband
really
southam
your
bump
of
curiosity
appears
to
be
fully
developed
what
has
barnes
husband
to
do
with
you
or
with
me
if
you
do
like
your
present
quarters
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
change
them
only
in
that
case
you
must
become
responsible
for
your
own
expenditure
i
turned
to
go
one
moment
if
you
intend
to
change
your
quarters
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
let
us
know
where
you
propose
to
go
i
will
let
you
know
if
i
do
go
at
any
rate
until
i
intend
to
remain
where
i
am
whether
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
considering
the
tragedy
which
followed
never
to
have
returned
to
barnes
house
at
all
is
more
than
i
can
say
that
particular
tragedy
might
not
have
happened
but
looking
at
the
matter
from
a
purely
personal
and
selfish
point
of
view
whether
that
would
have
been
better
for
me
or
worse
is
another
question
altogether
that
night
i
went
to
a
changing
one
of
notes
to
enable
me
to
do
so
afterwards
i
supped
at
a
restaurant
in
the
strand
then
i
returned
to
the
hotel
to
bed
i
was
more
than
half
afraid
of
being
waylaid
by
barnes
but
to
my
relief
it
was
the
maidservant
who
let
me
in
i
saw
and
heard
nothing
of
the
landlady
i
spent
the
night
in
peace
a
telegram
was
brought
me
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
shall
be
with
you
at
duncan
rothwell
as
i
perceived
that
it
had
been
despatched
from
derby
station
i
concluded
that
rothwell
had
telegraphed
while
in
the
very
act
of
journeying
to
town
twelve
arrived
and
no
one
and
nothing
came
for
me
about
a
quarter
to
one
i
went
into
the
hall
with
some
vague
idea
of
seeing
if
some
likely
looking
person
might
be
coming
down
the
street
the
hall
was
really
nothing
but
a
narrow
passage
the
front
door
was
open
with
his
feet
just
inside
the
open
doorway
was
a
man
lying
face
downwards
on
the
floor
my
first
impulse
was
to
beat
a
retreat
because
i
at
once
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
barnes
or
james
southam
or
whatever
the
landlady
mysterious
name
might
be
had
returned
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
not
only
unpleasantly
inclined
but
drunk
a
brief
inspection
from
the
other
end
of
the
passage
however
made
it
sufficiently
clear
that
whoever
the
recumbent
individual
was
it
was
not
the
gentleman
who
had
first
waited
on
and
then
assaulted
me
i
could
see
that
he
was
in
every
way
a
larger
man
his
silk
hat
had
fallen
sufficiently
off
his
head
to
enable
one
to
perceive
that
he
was
bald
as
i
stood
and
watched
him
i
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
curiously
unpleasant
feeling
he
lay
so
still
and
in
such
an
uncomfortable
posture
he
was
a
big
fat
man
it
struck
me
that
he
must
weigh
some
seventeen
or
eighteen
stone
he
had
fallen
flat
upon
his
stomach
his
face
was
so
close
to
the
floor
that
he
must
have
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
his
right
arm
was
bent
under
him
in
a
way
which
disagreeably
suggested
a
broken
limb
the
man
must
surely
be
something
more
than
drunk
he
must
i
told
myself
have
fallen
in
a
fit
with
an
indefinable
feeling
of
repugnance
i
advanced
to
give
him
aid
i
bent
over
him
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
withdrew
it
with
a
start
the
man
coat
was
wet
i
glanced
at
my
own
palm
it
was
covered
with
some
red
pigment
thoroughly
aroused
i
sprang
to
my
feet
help
mrs
barnes
i
cried
barnes
and
the
maidservant
came
running
up
together
barnes
i
said
still
staring
at
the
patch
of
red
upon
my
hand
i
believe
there
has
been
murder
done
murder
oh
my
god
do
you
think
he
did
it
i
looked
at
her
i
knew
what
she
meant
but
i
did
not
answer
her
you
had
better
send
for
the
police
and
for
a
medical
man
it
was
the
servant
who
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
catch
at
my
suggestion
doctor
granger
lives
across
the
road
i
fetch
him
she
did
fetch
him
luckily
the
doctor
was
at
home
so
soon
as
he
learned
what
urgent
need
there
was
for
his
services
he
came
hurrying
to
render
them
presently
a
policeman
came
upon
the
scene
he
was
followed
by
others
they
kept
the
street
clear
for
some
distance
from
the
hotel
of
the
crowd
which
began
rapidly
to
gather
the
whole
house
as
it
were
was
taken
in
charge
chapter
iv
the
alias
this
man
was
alive
within
the
last
few
minutes
that
was
the
verdict
he
is
still
quite
warm
the
doctor
looked
at
me
what
do
you
know
about
the
matter
nothing
i
was
expecting
a
visitor
as
he
was
late
i
came
down
from
the
and
went
into
the
hall
with
the
intention
of
seeing
if
he
was
coming
as
i
was
coming
down
the
stairs
i
saw
this
man
lying
on
the
floor
the
body
had
been
moved
into
the
little
front
room
on
the
ground
floor
which
i
afterwards
learned
was
used
as
a
private
for
such
visitors
to
the
house
as
chose
to
pay
for
one
there
were
present
in
the
room
besides
myself
the
doctor
a
young
man
with
a
shrewd
but
kindly
face
an
inspector
of
police
a
sergeant
who
kept
the
door
while
barnes
and
the
maid
kept
each
other
close
company
in
the
corner
by
the
fireplace
when
i
had
answered
the
doctor
the
inspector
questioned
me
upon
his
own
account
what
is
that
upon
your
hand
i
held
out
the
hand
to
which
he
referred
blood
this
unfortunate
man
blood
when
i
saw
him
lying
on
the
floor
my
impression
was
that
he
was
either
drunk
or
in
a
fit
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
view
of
rousing
him
directly
i
did
so
i
found
that
his
coat
was
wet
when
i
withdrew
my
hand
i
saw
that
it
was
covered
with
blood
it
was
then
i
realised
that
there
had
been
foul
play
the
dead
man
had
been
laid
on
the
table
it
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
the
whole
of
him
so
that
his
feet
hung
over
the
edge
he
was
a
big
man
all
over
in
particular
he
had
one
of
the
biggest
heads
i
ever
saw
there
was
not
a
hair
on
the
top
but
on
his
large
fat
cheeks
were
what
used
to
be
called
whiskers
which
were
in
colour
a
dirty
red
he
was
dressed
from
top
to
toe
in
glossy
black
broadcloth
he
wore
black
kid
gloves
upon
his
hands
in
the
centre
of
his
wide
expanse
of
shirtfront
was
so
far
as
i
was
a
judge
of
such
things
a
large
diamond
stud
a
heavy
gold
chain
spanned
his
waistcoat
is
this
the
person
you
were
expecting
inquired
the
inspector
that
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
the
person
i
was
expecting
was
to
me
personally
a
stranger
what
was
his
name
duncan
rothwell
i
received
a
telegram
from
him
this
morning
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
by
twelve
here
is
the
telegram
i
handed
it
to
the
inspector
twelve
and
when
do
you
say
that
you
discovered
this
man
on
the
floor
about
a
quarter
to
one
when
i
gave
the
alarm
the
landlady
of
the
hotel
and
the
servant
came
running
to
me
immediately
they
will
be
able
to
tell
you
what
time
it
was
and
i
should
say
that
the
doctor
was
here
within
five
minutes
the
inspector
turned
to
the
doctor
and
what
was
the
time
sir
when
you
arrived
i
should
say
as
nearly
as
possible
about
ten
minutes
to
one
i
lunch
at
one
i
was
just
going
to
wash
when
i
was
called
and
how
long
do
you
say
sir
he
had
then
been
dead
he
had
probably
been
alive
five
minutes
before
then
in
that
case
he
must
have
been
alive
when
this
man
says
he
entered
the
hall
the
inspector
pointed
to
me
i
do
not
say
that
the
man
was
stabbed
in
the
back
under
the
left
shoulder
probably
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
entering
the
house
i
have
only
made
a
superficial
examination
but
i
think
it
probable
that
the
blow
killed
him
in
an
instant
before
that
is
he
could
breathe
the
breath
which
he
was
breathing
as
it
were
right
out
and
i
do
say
this
that
if
this
gentleman
had
entered
the
hall
a
minute
before
he
actually
did
he
would
have
seen
the
man
in
the
very
act
of
being
murdered
the
inspector
turned
again
to
me
where
did
this
duncan
rothwell
live
that
also
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
the
fact
is
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
him
a
firm
of
solicitors
placed
him
in
communication
with
me
what
was
he
coming
to
see
you
about
with
reference
to
this
advertisement
i
gave
the
inspector
the
advertisement
which
had
placed
me
in
the
position
which
so
far
did
not
promise
to
be
much
to
my
advantage
what
is
your
name
james
southam
are
you
the
james
southam
here
alluded
to
that
again
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
saw
that
advertisement
the
day
before
yesterday
i
at
once
communicated
with
cleaver
and
caxton
yesterday
i
received
this
letter
and
this
morning
the
telegram
which
you
already
have
the
inspector
carefully
read
the
letter
which
had
come
to
me
signed
duncan
rothwell
then
without
asking
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
he
placed
the
letter
the
advertisement
and
the
telegram
in
his
and
the
in
his
pocket
the
action
struck
me
as
extremely
and
indeed
unpleasantly
significant
an
examination
of
the
dead
man
pockets
disclosed
the
somewhat
curious
fact
that
they
contained
nothing
but
a
massive
gold
watch
without
a
maker
name
a
sheaf
of
which
unenclosed
in
any
cover
was
simply
thrust
in
the
of
his
coat
and
consisted
of
no
less
than
one
hundred
notes
some
gold
and
silver
coins
four
pounds
thirteen
shillings
if
i
remember
rightly
in
a
plain
leather
purse
and
in
an
apparently
forgotten
corner
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
was
a
torn
scrap
of
a
visiting
card
on
it
was
the
name
raymond
but
the
card
was
torn
in
such
a
manner
that
whether
this
was
a
surname
or
a
christian
name
there
was
as
the
police
would
themselves
have
said
no
evidence
to
show
but
beyond
these
articles
there
was
absolutely
nothing
which
would
serve
or
could
be
used
as
a
means
of
identification
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
dead
man
had
taken
care
that
there
should
be
nothing
about
him
by
means
of
which
he
could
be
identified
as
soon
as
the
inspector
seemed
disposed
to
allow
me
to
quit
his
presence
i
went
straight
away
to
cleaver
and
caxton
again
i
found
the
senior
partner
alone
my
appearance
seemed
to
surprise
him
possibly
in
my
bearing
there
was
something
which
was
a
trifle
suggestive
of
the
condition
of
my
mind
well
has
rothwell
been
i
shut
the
door
behind
me
looking
him
full
in
the
face
you
appear
to
have
let
me
in
for
a
nice
little
thing
mr
cleaver
what
do
you
mean
it
is
what
you
mean
i
intend
to
understand
before
i
leave
this
room
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
answer
me
one
or
two
questions
cleaver
first
is
duncan
rothwell
the
name
of
the
client
for
whom
you
have
been
acting
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
regarding
me
with
rather
a
curious
smile
you
have
a
singular
method
of
address
southam
before
i
answer
this
question
perhaps
you
will
answer
mine
has
rothwell
been
to
see
you
what
does
he
look
like
look
like
again
the
curious
smile
you
continue
to
answer
question
with
question
tell
me
sir
has
any
one
calling
himself
duncan
rothwell
been
to
see
you
we
will
discuss
the
question
of
what
he
looked
like
afterwards
i
paused
before
i
spoke
again
then
keenly
noted
the
effect
of
my
words
for
all
i
know
duncan
rothwell
lies
murdered
at
hotel
cleaver
sprang
to
his
feet
murdered
precisely
some
one
lies
there
murdered
if
you
will
tell
me
what
he
looks
like
i
will
tell
you
if
it
is
duncan
rothwell
not
unnaturally
cleaver
appeared
bewildered
explain
yourself
a
little
more
clearly
southam
and
to
begin
with
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
answer
yes
or
no
to
my
question
has
any
one
calling
himself
duncan
rothwell
been
to
see
you
i
told
him
what
had
happened
so
far
as
i
understood
it
his
amazement
unmistakably
was
genuine
you
say
that
the
dead
man
had
nothing
on
him
by
means
of
which
he
could
be
recognised
then
in
that
case
we
can
do
nothing
to
assist
in
his
identification
we
ourselves
have
never
seen
duncan
rothwell
in
our
lives
all
our
communications
with
him
have
been
by
letter
he
acknowledged
one
thing
that
the
person
for
whom
they
had
been
acting
was
duncan
rothwell
but
beyond
that
one
fact
i
learned
nothing
at
all
he
protested
that
duncan
rothwell
had
instructed
them
by
letter
to
advertise
for
a
james
southam
of
dulborough
and
that
that
was
all
they
knew
of
the
matter
he
even
suggested
that
since
i
was
james
southam
i
if
i
chose
could
fill
up
the
blanks
when
i
returned
to
the
hotel
little
wiser
than
i
left
it
as
soon
as
i
set
foot
inside
the
door
the
inspector
of
police
clapping
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
drew
me
aside
i
did
not
like
the
fashion
in
which
he
addressed
me
at
all
see
here
southam
i
do
not
wish
to
make
myself
disagreeable
but
i
need
scarcely
point
out
to
you
that
there
are
circumstances
in
this
case
which
are
to
say
the
least
of
it
peculiar
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
your
movements
will
be
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
and
should
you
make
any
attempt
to
elude
us
we
may
consider
it
our
duty
to
place
you
in
safe
custody
that
all
right
i
replied
lock
me
up
and
hang
me
do
it
only
needs
some
little
trifle
of
that
kind
to
make
the
situation
altogether
what
it
should
be
the
man
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
i
know
no
more
how
he
came
to
his
death
than
the
man
in
the
moon
which
things
are
possibly
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
police
should
make
of
me
one
of
their
proverbial
examples
it
struck
me
that
the
inspector
did
not
altogether
know
what
to
make
of
me
although
he
did
not
arrest
me
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
might
almost
as
well
have
done
until
the
inquest
took
place
the
hotel
was
practically
in
charge
with
everybody
in
it
a
policeman
slept
on
the
premises
other
policemen
were
continually
about
the
premises
asking
questions
and
making
themselves
objectionable
both
by
day
and
night
i
myself
began
to
feel
that
i
had
a
haunted
hangdog
sort
of
air
as
for
barnes
if
she
had
not
a
great
crime
upon
her
conscience
it
was
not
because
she
did
not
look
it
she
seemed
to
be
growing
hourly
thinner
i
knew
very
well
that
she
was
full
of
a
great
anxiety
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
me
in
private
but
dared
not
for
fear
of
prying
eyes
and
ears
she
solved
the
difficulty
in
her
own
way
by
pinning
a
note
to
my
pillow
so
that
i
found
it
on
going
to
bed
on
the
night
before
the
inquest
it
had
neither
beginning
nor
end
and
ran
something
like
this
every
word
was
underlined
say
nothing
about
my
husband
for
god
sake
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
deed
of
horror
you
know
that
he
had
not
and
i
know
no
good
purpose
will
be
served
by
dragging
him
into
it
and
so
bringing
on
me
greater
ruin
than
has
come
already
as
i
read
this
scarcely
judicious
appeal
i
told
myself
that
barnes
was
certainly
wrong
in
saying
that
i
knew
that
her
mysterious
husband
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
which
had
been
wrought
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
knew
nothing
the
more
i
reflected
however
the
less
i
liked
the
look
of
the
circumstances
which
seemed
to
suggest
a
guilty
knowledge
on
the
part
of
my
whilom
friend
the
waiter
it
appeared
at
least
possible
that
he
was
the
james
southam
who
had
been
actually
advertised
for
and
that
he
was
very
well
aware
that
duncan
rothwell
had
something
to
say
to
him
which
was
very
distinctly
not
to
his
advantage
looking
at
the
violence
which
without
hesitation
he
had
used
towards
me
was
it
not
conceivable
that
he
might
have
and
indeed
had
used
still
greater
violence
towards
rothwell
the
inquest
was
not
over
in
a
day
though
the
only
light
it
threw
upon
the
crime
went
to
prove
the
identity
of
the
murdered
man
a
singular
state
of
things
the
evidence
upon
this
point
revealed
by
no
means
tending
to
elucidate
the
mystery
the
dead
man
actually
turned
out
to
be
jonas
hartopp
the
head
and
in
fact
the
sole
remaining
partner
in
the
firm
of
manufacturing
jewellers
hartopp
and
company
the
strange
part
of
the
business
was
that
he
seemed
to
have
been
duncan
rothwell
as
well
that
is
he
had
assumed
that
name
for
reasons
which
were
very
far
from
being
plain
hartopp
and
company
were
a
birmingham
firm
a
wealthy
one
jonas
hartopp
himself
had
had
the
reputation
of
being
as
rich
as
a
reasonable
man
would
care
to
be
duncan
rothwell
had
written
to
cleaver
and
caxton
from
liverpool
where
he
had
taken
rooms
as
it
would
seem
for
the
special
purpose
of
communicating
with
them
he
had
never
occupied
the
rooms
but
had
given
the
most
peremptory
instructions
that
all
letters
and
telegrams
should
at
once
be
forwarded
to
an
address
at
aston
the
address
at
aston
turned
out
to
be
a
tobacconist
shop
the
tobacconist
at
once
recognised
the
dead
man
as
being
the
person
he
had
known
as
duncan
rothwell
why
the
wealthy
birmingham
jeweller
jonas
hartopp
had
chosen
to
masquerade
as
duncan
rothwell
or
what
was
the
something
to
his
advantage
which
he
proposed
to
communicate
to
james
southam
there
was
not
a
shred
or
tittle
of
evidence
to
show
nor
was
there
a
thread
of
light
thrown
upon
the
shadows
which
enveloped
the
mystery
of
his
sudden
death
as
it
chanced
no
question
was
asked
me
while
i
was
in
the
which
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
bringing
in
the
incident
of
barnes
husband
i
had
a
sufficiently
bad
time
of
it
without
being
actuated
by
a
burning
desire
to
involve
myself
in
further
complications
never
in
my
life
had
i
been
so
badgered
they
would
not
accept
my
plain
statement
that
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
why
james
southam
had
been
advertised
for
or
who
had
advertised
for
him
or
what
was
the
something
which
he
was
to
learn
to
his
advantage
the
coroner
and
the
police
and
for
the
matter
of
that
the
public
too
appeared
to
be
under
the
impression
that
since
i
owned
that
my
name
was
james
southam
therefore
i
held
the
key
of
the
mystery
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
or
at
any
rate
that
i
ought
to
they
had
raked
up
the
circumstances
of
my
life
from
my
earliest
days
they
had
made
all
sorts
of
inquiries
about
me
in
all
sorts
of
directions
yet
they
could
find
nothing
which
could
fairly
be
said
to
tell
against
me
and
that
for
the
sufficient
and
from
my
point
of
view
satisfactory
reason
that
there
was
nothing
to
find
notwithstanding
which
when
the
inquiry
closed
i
was
conscious
that
more
than
one
person
in
court
and
a
good
many
out
of
it
cherished
the
impression
that
i
had
had
a
hand
indirectly
if
not
directly
in
the
murdered
man
despatch
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
being
that
jonas
hartopp
otherwise
known
as
duncan
rothwell
had
been
murdered
by
some
person
or
persons
unknown
chapter
v
the
new
guest
oddly
enough
it
was
not
until
i
was
smarting
under
the
feelings
occasioned
by
the
reflection
that
i
had
come
out
of
the
inquiry
with
a
smirch
upon
my
character
that
it
occurred
to
me
what
a
fool
i
had
been
when
i
was
in
the
in
not
going
even
out
of
my
way
to
transfer
suspicion
from
myself
to
the
scamp
whom
barnes
had
assured
me
was
her
husband
i
arrived
then
and
there
at
a
resolution
i
would
play
on
lines
of
my
own
that
favourite
part
in
fiction
the
role
of
the
amateur
detective
i
would
trace
to
their
sources
the
various
threads
which
had
become
complicated
in
such
a
tangled
web
of
crime
i
would
unravel
them
one
by
one
if
necessary
i
would
make
the
whole
thing
plain
in
theory
an
excellent
resolution
situated
as
i
was
not
an
easy
one
to
put
into
practice
before
the
end
of
the
coroner
inquest
cleaver
and
caxton
informed
me
that
their
guarantee
to
provide
for
the
expenses
of
my
sojourn
at
barnes
establishment
thenceforward
was
withdrawn
of
the
four
banknotes
which
had
come
to
me
in
duncan
rothwell
letter
about
fifteen
pounds
remained
if
that
sum
might
be
credited
to
my
account
on
the
debit
side
of
the
column
was
the
injury
which
my
connection
with
the
affair
had
at
least
temporarily
done
my
character
if
before
i
had
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
remunerative
employment
i
should
find
it
now
still
harder
on
the
morning
after
the
close
of
the
inquiry
i
was
meditating
taking
an
immediate
departure
from
the
house
in
which
i
had
met
with
experiences
which
had
been
to
anything
but
my
advantage
when
barnes
came
into
the
room
her
worries
had
worn
her
almost
to
a
shadow
i
felt
that
if
she
continued
to
diminish
at
the
same
rate
long
she
soon
literally
would
entirely
waste
away
her
nervous
tricks
seemed
to
have
become
accentuated
she
stood
rubbing
her
hands
together
apparently
for
the
moment
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
i
hope
sir
that
you
are
not
going
then
you
hope
wrong
barnes
i
certainly
am
going
and
that
at
once
you
must
sir
you
really
must
you
are
wrong
again
barnes
for
i
really
must
if
on
one
account
only
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
pay
your
terms
she
gave
a
sudden
movement
forward
coming
to
lean
with
both
her
hands
upon
the
table
her
voice
dropped
to
that
odd
palpitating
whisper
of
which
she
seemed
to
be
so
fond
you
need
let
that
trouble
you
you
can
live
board
and
lodging
free
and
you
be
welcome
i
observed
her
closely
in
her
face
there
was
something
which
was
positively
uncanny
if
ever
a
person
had
a
haunted
look
it
was
barnes
why
do
you
make
to
me
such
a
proposition
do
you
consider
that
i
am
the
sort
of
person
who
would
be
willing
to
snatch
at
charity
or
are
you
in
the
habit
of
giving
strangers
board
and
lodging
free
indeed
no
but
it
different
with
you
if
you
leave
me
now
i
shall
not
dare
to
stay
in
the
house
and
that
the
truth
i
feel
as
if
you
were
guarding
me
as
if
hungry
eyes
were
on
the
house
seeking
for
a
chance
to
work
me
evil
but
that
the
hidden
watchers
dare
not
come
in
to
do
that
to
me
which
they
desire
while
my
roof
still
shelters
you
sir
do
you
think
that
did
it
do
i
think
that
who
did
what
do
you
think
that
my
husband
killed
that
man
to
be
frank
with
you
i
think
it
extremely
possible
that
he
knows
as
much
of
the
business
as
may
altogether
be
good
for
him
more
for
instance
than
you
or
i
have
been
reproaching
myself
for
having
done
as
you
requested
and
not
having
at
least
alluded
to
the
gentleman
in
question
when
giving
my
evidence
before
the
coroner
my
words
set
her
trembling
you
did
quite
right
you
would
have
been
sorry
for
it
afterwards
i
can
not
tell
you
why
or
how
but
i
am
certain
that
my
husband
had
no
more
to
do
with
that
deed
of
blood
than
you
or
i
the
woman
intense
earnestness
made
me
stare
i
can
only
say
barnes
that
i
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
share
your
certainty
that
is
one
reason
why
i
ask
you
why
i
implore
you
to
stay
there
is
a
cloud
hanging
over
you
and
over
me
it
is
the
same
cloud
if
you
stay
i
feel
that
it
may
be
lifted
but
if
you
leave
it
may
rest
on
us
for
ever
what
she
said
was
nonsense
pure
and
simple
still
i
suffered
myself
to
be
persuaded
i
agreed
to
stay
on
at
any
rate
for
a
time
the
satisfaction
with
which
she
received
my
decision
was
so
pronounced
that
one
might
have
thought
that
i
had
done
her
the
greatest
service
in
the
world
i
went
out
in
the
afternoon
when
i
came
back
in
the
evening
not
a
little
to
my
surprise
my
food
was
brought
me
by
a
man
i
stared
at
him
askance
hitherto
the
whole
service
of
the
house
in
which
i
had
been
the
only
guest
had
been
done
by
the
maid
now
i
found
myself
confronted
by
a
quite
waiter
attired
in
the
orthodox
costume
of
his
kind
his
presence
was
so
unexpected
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
conceal
my
astonishment
who
the
deuce
are
you
i
blurted
out
the
fellow
began
to
smirk
in
reply
new
waiter
sir
only
came
this
afternoon
sir
i
had
no
notion
that
barnes
contemplated
making
such
an
addition
to
her
establishment
no
sir
perhaps
not
sir
business
is
very
slack
just
now
but
the
season
is
coming
on
and
the
house
will
very
soon
be
full
this
was
emphatically
a
lie
so
far
from
the
season
just
coming
on
in
an
sense
it
was
rapidly
drawing
to
an
end
and
so
far
as
barnes
was
personally
concerned
apparently
a
bitter
one
too
what
she
wanted
circumstanced
as
she
was
with
such
a
gorgeous
individual
as
this
about
the
place
or
what
she
could
find
for
him
to
do
surpassed
my
comprehension
the
fellow
bustled
about
the
room
pretending
to
busy
himself
in
accordance
with
a
trick
of
his
trade
with
nothing
at
all
been
here
long
sir
you
know
very
well
how
long
i
have
been
here
beg
pardon
sir
how
that
you
have
read
it
in
the
papers
do
feign
ignorance
with
me
my
man
the
fellow
turned
away
he
was
industriously
polishing
an
already
spotless
glass
you
allude
to
the
recent
unfortunate
occurrence
sir
i
believe
that
i
did
see
something
about
it
you
believe
is
that
all
you
are
perfectly
aware
that
you
are
as
well
up
in
what
you
call
the
recent
occurrence
as
i
am
you
know
all
about
me
how
i
came
into
the
house
when
i
came
my
name
and
everything
i
do
not
know
why
i
said
this
but
i
did
say
it
and
i
felt
that
it
was
true
the
man
seemed
taken
aback
barnes
did
mention
your
name
he
murmured
you
knew
it
without
her
mentioning
it
you
can
leave
the
room
when
i
want
you
i
will
ring
i
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
his
presence
seemed
to
chafe
me
i
knew
not
why
he
was
not
his
bearing
was
wholly
respectful
and
yet
some
instinct
had
seemed
to
warn
me
that
while
i
was
in
his
near
neighbourhood
it
would
be
just
as
well
that
i
should
be
upon
my
guard
when
i
had
eaten
i
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
barnes
her
nervous
system
had
not
improved
since
the
morning
even
the
sight
of
me
seemed
to
fill
her
with
terror
her
eyes
looked
at
everything
except
at
me
i
wondered
if
some
disaster
had
been
added
to
the
sum
of
her
already
troubles
you
have
a
new
waiter
i
began
yes
she
spoke
in
a
stammering
whisper
her
features
were
agitated
with
the
former
reminiscence
of
vitus
dance
yes
a
new
waiter
i
hope
very
sincerely
for
your
sake
barnes
that
he
may
ere
long
have
other
guests
to
wait
upon
besides
myself
yes
the
same
irresolute
muttering
yes
i
hope
he
may
i
had
no
idea
that
you
thought
of
making
an
engagement
of
the
kind
just
now
no
i
do
think
i
told
you
what
was
the
matter
with
the
woman
why
did
she
persist
in
speaking
in
that
tone
of
voice
as
if
she
was
fearful
of
being
overheard
and
why
did
she
apparently
not
dare
to
allow
her
eyes
to
rest
even
for
a
moment
on
my
face
she
had
been
so
effusive
in
the
morning
now
on
a
sudden
she
had
returned
to
the
condition
of
almost
doddering
terror
which
had
marked
her
bearing
during
the
time
we
had
a
policeman
quartered
in
the
house
where
did
you
get
the
man
what
is
his
name
and
what
do
you
know
of
him
as
i
put
my
questions
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
she
was
going
to
favour
me
with
one
of
her
frenzied
bursts
of
confidence
but
while
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
all
at
once
her
frame
became
rigid
i
seemed
to
see
the
unspoken
words
lying
on
her
lips
turning
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
obvious
change
in
her
manner
i
found
that
the
new
waiter
had
opened
the
door
and
unannounced
had
entered
the
room
at
sight
of
him
her
agitation
again
assumed
the
upper
hand
i
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
sir
i
have
something
which
i
must
do
i
did
excuse
her
but
when
i
had
left
her
i
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
my
instinct
had
been
right
and
that
there
was
more
in
the
new
waiter
than
met
the
eye
it
seemed
scarcely
likely
that
even
a
landlady
of
such
an
eccentric
type
as
barnes
would
increase
her
staff
when
the
only
guest
which
her
house
contained
was
such
an
emphatically
unprofitable
one
as
i
bade
fair
to
be
however
in
one
respect
the
position
of
affairs
was
destined
to
be
speedily
changed
the
house
received
not
only
another
guest
but
also
one
who
bade
fair
to
be
as
profitable
a
one
as
a
landlady
heart
could
wish
it
was
on
the
day
immediately
following
that
arrived
i
had
been
out
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
renewing
the
weary
search
for
employment
which
might
provide
me
with
the
means
for
obtaining
my
daily
bread
the
first
intimation
i
had
of
her
arrival
was
when
having
dined
i
was
thinking
of
a
quiet
pipe
and
of
an
early
retirement
to
bed
chapter
vi
the
woman
with
one
hand
compliments
sir
and
would
you
mind
stepping
upstairs
i
had
a
lighted
match
in
my
hand
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
applying
it
to
the
bowl
of
my
pipe
when
the
latest
importation
in
waiters
brought
me
the
message
mrs
i
let
the
match
go
out
and
pray
who
may
be
the
lady
who
arrived
sir
and
who
has
taken
a
private
no
indeed
and
what
does
want
with
me
i
do
know
sir
she
asked
me
to
give
you
her
compliments
and
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
step
upstairs
i
stepped
upstairs
wondering
i
was
received
by
a
tall
and
somewhat
ponderous
woman
who
was
dressed
in
a
silk
costume
almost
as
if
she
were
going
to
a
ball
she
half
rose
from
the
couch
as
i
came
in
inclining
her
head
in
my
direction
with
what
struck
me
as
a
slightly
patronising
smile
she
spoke
in
a
loud
hearty
tone
of
voice
which
was
marked
by
what
struck
me
as
being
a
yorkshire
twang
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
southam
i
was
really
more
than
half
afraid
to
ask
you
as
it
is
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
but
i
do
so
want
you
to
write
me
a
letter
to
write
you
a
letter
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
little
slow
of
comprehension
i
have
lost
my
hand
she
stretched
out
her
right
arm
both
arms
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
i
could
not
but
notice
how
beautifully
they
were
moulded
their
massive
contours
their
snowy
whiteness
she
wore
gloves
which
reached
nearly
to
her
elbows
so
far
as
i
could
judge
there
appeared
to
be
a
hand
inside
of
both
she
seemed
to
read
my
thoughts
still
continuing
to
hold
her
right
arm
out
in
front
of
her
you
think
my
hand
is
gloved
i
always
wear
it
so
but
the
glove
conceals
a
dummy
come
and
feel
it
i
bowed
i
was
content
to
take
her
at
her
word
i
had
no
wish
to
put
her
to
the
actual
test
i
have
never
been
able
to
gain
complete
control
over
my
left
hand
to
use
it
as
if
it
were
my
right
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
not
clever
enough
i
can
scribble
with
it
but
only
scribble
when
i
desire
to
have
a
letter
properly
written
i
am
dependent
upon
outsiders
help
will
you
write
one
for
me
now
it
was
an
odd
request
for
a
at
an
hotel
to
address
to
a
perfect
stranger
but
i
complied
the
letter
she
dictated
and
which
i
wrote
at
her
dictation
seemed
to
me
the
merest
triviality
a
scribble
would
have
served
the
purpose
just
as
well
she
chattered
all
the
time
that
i
was
writing
and
when
i
had
finished
she
went
on
chattering
still
all
at
once
she
broke
into
a
theme
to
which
i
ought
to
have
become
accustomed
but
had
not
do
you
know
southam
that
i
have
been
reading
about
this
dreadful
murder
case
how
the
papers
have
all
been
full
of
it
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
a
sort
of
a
way
it
was
that
which
has
brought
me
to
this
hotel
if
that
were
so
i
retorted
then
her
tastes
were
individual
she
perceived
attractions
where
the
average
man
saw
none
she
laughed
i
do
know
that
it
was
exactly
that
but
the
truth
is
southam
i
was
interested
in
you
the
way
in
which
she
emphasised
the
pronoun
a
little
startled
me
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
ferret
you
out
directly
i
got
to
the
hotel
and
that
then
if
i
liked
the
look
of
you
would
make
you
an
offer
you
see
how
frank
i
am
she
certainly
was
frank
to
a
fault
in
one
sense
and
yet
i
wondered
as
i
replied
to
her
my
tone
was
grim
it
is
very
good
of
you
and
now
that
as
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
do
like
the
look
of
me
as
you
can
scarcely
fail
to
do
may
i
inquire
what
is
the
nature
of
the
offer
you
propose
to
make
she
laughed
again
possibly
my
perceptions
were
unusually
keen
but
all
the
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
about
her
a
something
an
atmosphere
if
you
will
which
was
not
exactly
suggestive
of
laughter
unless
i
was
mistaken
her
faculties
were
as
much
on
the
alert
as
mine
were
she
was
engaged
in
summing
me
up
when
she
feigned
to
be
least
observant
you
must
understand
southam
that
i
know
all
about
you
which
the
papers
had
to
tell
and
that
was
not
a
little
so
we
are
not
exactly
strangers
at
least
that
is
you
are
not
wholly
a
stranger
to
me
besides
which
i
myself
once
knew
a
person
whose
name
was
southam
i
started
the
woman
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
although
she
pretended
to
be
trifling
with
her
dress
you
knew
a
person
whose
name
was
southam
indeed
who
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
she
ignored
my
question
have
you
any
relatives
of
your
own
name
not
that
i
am
aware
of
though
there
seems
to
be
more
than
one
southam
about
in
the
world
what
southam
was
it
you
knew
her
tone
was
ostentatiously
indifferent
oh
it
does
matter
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
as
you
say
i
suppose
there
are
heaps
of
southams
about
in
the
world
i
only
wanted
to
explain
to
you
that
you
were
not
so
absolutely
unknown
to
me
as
the
fact
that
this
is
our
first
actual
meeting
might
lead
you
to
imagine
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
if
you
are
still
seeking
employment
i
thought
from
what
i
read
in
the
papers
that
it
was
just
possible
you
might
be
you
have
supposed
correctly
i
am
would
you
like
to
fill
the
post
of
secretary
of
secretary
i
paused
for
a
moment
to
consider
not
the
suggestion
of
such
a
post
but
the
source
from
whence
the
suggestion
came
to
whom
to
me
it
is
very
kind
of
you
but
do
you
clearly
understand
madam
that
you
are
speaking
to
a
person
whose
character
is
under
a
cloud
because
you
were
suspected
of
having
murdered
that
man
her
question
was
brutal
in
its
candour
precisely
because
i
was
suspected
and
for
all
i
know
still
am
the
people
who
suspected
you
were
fools
i
will
back
my
capacity
as
a
judge
of
character
even
at
sight
against
their
suspicions
you
are
not
of
the
stuff
of
which
murderers
are
made
her
tone
was
short
and
sharp
i
had
almost
written
sarcastic
as
if
she
thought
it
a
shame
to
a
man
not
to
be
made
of
the
stuff
of
which
murderers
are
she
went
on
speaking
quickly
even
brusquely
i
will
trust
you
if
you
on
your
part
will
trust
me
as
i
have
told
you
and
as
i
will
prove
to
you
if
as
i
almost
believe
you
doubt
me
i
have
lost
my
hand
see
hastily
before
i
could
stop
her
she
began
to
unbutton
her
right
glove
she
only
unloosed
a
button
or
two
when
the
whole
thing
glove
hand
and
all
came
clean
away
and
she
held
out
towards
me
her
handless
arm
i
stared
at
a
loss
for
words
not
a
little
shocked
the
disfigurement
was
so
dreadful
and
seemed
to
have
been
so
recent
her
voice
grew
bitter
i
lost
that
hand
under
circumstances
which
impressed
its
loss
upon
my
memory
as
it
were
i
seem
to
be
losing
it
anew
every
hour
of
every
day
it
has
left
me
impotent
will
you
relieve
my
impotence
will
you
become
my
secretary
there
will
not
be
much
for
you
to
do
but
there
will
be
something
the
salary
which
i
shall
pay
you
will
not
be
a
large
one
but
it
will
perhaps
suffice
till
something
better
offers
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
as
they
say
in
the
advertisements
all
found
do
not
give
me
your
answer
at
once
it
may
be
that
i
shall
stay
in
the
hotel
some
time
and
at
any
rate
while
i
am
here
possibly
you
will
not
refuse
to
act
as
my
amanuensis
you
can
see
with
your
own
eyes
how
much
i
am
in
want
of
one
again
she
drew
my
attention
to
her
mangled
arm
as
she
suggested
i
neither
accepted
nor
declined
her
offer
there
and
then
it
was
one
which
needed
consideration
from
more
points
than
one
for
instance
while
she
did
know
something
of
me
if
what
she
had
read
in
the
newspaper
reports
could
be
called
knowledge
i
knew
literally
nothing
of
her
for
all
i
could
tell
she
might
be
an
adventuress
lately
freed
from
the
purlieus
of
a
gaol
i
did
consent
to
do
any
secretarial
work
she
might
require
during
her
stay
in
the
hotel
by
the
time
she
left
it
i
might
be
able
to
see
my
way
more
clearly
than
i
did
just
then
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
during
the
few
days
which
followed
and
the
more
i
saw
of
her
the
less
i
could
make
her
out
there
was
a
good
deal
of
work
for
me
to
do
such
as
it
was
i
wondered
if
she
had
brought
it
with
her
in
order
to
furnish
her
with
an
excuse
to
give
me
occupation
there
were
papers
for
me
to
copy
papers
which
seemed
to
be
of
the
very
slightest
importance
while
i
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
copying
them
she
interrupted
me
without
remorse
and
talked
and
talked
and
talked
during
those
conversations
she
learned
a
great
deal
of
my
history
while
i
ascertained
nothing
at
all
of
hers
i
found
that
she
was
a
woman
of
quick
and
imperious
temper
to
fence
with
one
of
her
interminable
questions
annoyed
her
to
have
declined
to
answer
one
would
have
involved
an
immediate
breach
if
i
took
service
with
her
it
would
be
with
my
eyes
open
i
should
have
to
be
prepared
for
squalls
though
she
gave
me
employment
as
if
she
were
bestowing
charity
she
would
expect
and
require
perfect
obedience
from
me
in
return
i
do
not
think
that
as
a
rule
i
am
quick
in
taking
dislike
at
a
person
but
there
did
in
spite
of
myself
grow
up
in
my
mind
a
sense
of
antipathy
towards
i
felt
as
if
she
were
watching
me
pumping
me
turning
me
inside
out
as
if
i
were
some
old
glove
playing
with
me
with
that
cruel
sort
of
enjoyment
with
which
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
and
i
did
not
find
the
feeling
an
agreeable
one
to
add
to
my
comfort
i
had
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
the
new
waiter
had
an
attentive
eye
upon
my
movements
in
a
sense
it
was
an
eye
for
which
i
did
not
thank
him
i
almost
suspected
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
sleepless
spy
i
half
believed
that
not
infrequently
he
was
an
unseen
auditor
of
my
interviews
with
i
should
like
to
have
caught
him
in
the
act
one
night
i
could
not
sleep
i
found
that
i
had
left
my
pipe
downstairs
i
started
off
to
get
it
i
had
scarcely
got
outside
the
bedroom
door
when
i
all
but
stumbled
over
the
new
waiter
before
i
had
discovered
who
it
was
i
had
pinned
him
to
the
floor
he
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
could
altogether
have
liked
the
way
in
which
i
handled
him
chapter
vii
the
second
encounter
i
began
as
the
days
went
by
to
be
more
and
more
a
prey
to
unhealthy
and
apparently
unreasonable
doubts
and
fears
fears
which
in
truth
were
so
intangible
that
they
were
without
form
and
void
but
which
were
very
real
for
all
that
i
began
to
feel
as
if
a
net
were
being
drawn
tighter
and
tighter
round
me
and
as
if
every
step
i
took
was
beset
by
hidden
dangers
such
a
mental
condition
was
as
i
have
said
an
unhealthy
one
i
realised
that
well
enough
and
i
had
been
wandering
one
evening
to
and
fro
on
the
embankment
striving
to
free
myself
if
only
for
a
time
from
the
imaginary
mists
and
shadows
which
seemed
to
compass
me
about
when
as
i
was
turning
into
the
street
in
which
stood
barnes
hotel
i
saw
a
man
crouching
in
the
darkness
of
the
wall
what
was
the
man
purpose
i
had
no
doubt
he
was
seeking
for
concealment
he
had
seen
me
before
i
saw
him
and
was
endeavouring
to
escape
my
scrutiny
i
took
him
to
be
the
new
waiter
i
supposed
that
i
had
caught
him
in
the
act
of
spying
on
me
at
last
i
turned
swiftly
on
him
and
before
he
could
retreat
i
had
him
by
the
shoulders
before
i
let
you
go
my
friend
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
now
and
here
what
is
the
cause
of
the
extreme
interest
which
you
evidently
take
in
my
proceedings
that
was
what
i
said
to
him
but
already
before
i
had
said
my
say
right
out
i
perceived
that
i
was
wrong
that
the
man
i
had
hold
of
was
not
the
man
i
thought
he
was
this
man
was
shorter
and
of
slighter
build
and
he
showed
more
signs
of
fight
than
within
my
experience
the
other
had
evinced
he
wriggled
in
my
grasp
like
an
eel
but
holding
tightly
on
to
him
i
dragged
him
a
little
into
the
light
when
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
glimpse
at
him
there
came
from
between
my
lips
a
series
of
interjections
you
james
southam
mr
barnes
good
god
i
had
hardly
spoken
when
he
knocked
me
down
i
was
so
taken
by
surprise
that
i
was
unable
to
offer
the
least
resistance
he
felled
me
again
as
he
had
felled
me
before
as
if
i
had
been
a
ninepin
by
the
time
i
had
realised
what
had
happened
i
was
lying
on
my
back
on
the
pavement
his
hand
was
on
my
throat
and
his
knee
was
on
my
chest
he
was
peering
closely
into
my
face
so
closely
that
i
could
feel
his
breath
upon
my
cheeks
it
you
again
is
it
i
thought
it
was
do
you
make
a
noise
or
i
choke
the
life
right
out
of
you
you
tell
me
straight
out
what
it
is
you
want
with
me
do
you
hear
as
if
to
drive
his
question
well
home
he
gave
my
head
a
sharp
tap
against
the
pavement
his
strength
must
have
been
prodigious
i
was
conscious
that
with
him
above
me
thus
and
with
that
iron
grasp
upon
my
throat
i
was
wholly
at
his
mercy
the
hour
was
late
although
almost
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
strand
the
place
was
solitary
not
a
creature
might
pass
just
where
we
were
the
whole
night
through
take
your
hand
from
my
windpipe
i
can
not
speak
you
are
choking
me
i
gasped
give
me
your
word
you
will
make
no
noise
if
i
do
see
here
he
was
clutching
a
knife
as
ugly
a
looking
knife
as
ever
i
saw
he
brandished
it
before
my
eyes
i
give
my
word
i
managed
to
utter
he
relaxed
his
hold
it
was
a
comfort
to
be
again
able
to
freely
inflate
my
lungs
though
the
continued
presence
of
his
knee
on
my
chest
was
none
too
pleasant
with
the
point
of
his
knife
he
actually
pricked
my
nose
do
you
try
to
move
or
i
will
cut
your
throat
as
if
you
were
a
pig
lie
still
and
answer
my
questions
and
straight
mind
or
be
sorry
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
i
want
nothing
from
you
i
have
never
wanted
anything
you
have
been
under
an
entire
misapprehension
throughout
once
more
with
gruesome
sportiveness
he
tickled
my
nose
with
his
knife
stow
that
my
lad
it
no
good
trying
to
catch
this
bird
with
salt
how
did
you
come
to
know
that
my
name
was
james
southam
i
never
did
know
it
the
simple
truth
is
that
that
name
happened
to
be
mine
what
that
i
say
that
that
name
happens
to
be
mine
i
am
james
southam
bending
down
he
glared
at
me
with
eyes
which
seemed
to
glow
like
burning
coal
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
precisely
what
i
say
if
you
choose
to
examine
the
contents
of
my
pockets
they
are
at
your
mercy
you
will
find
ample
proof
of
the
truth
of
what
i
say
besides
i
take
it
that
you
have
had
truth
of
this
proof
from
the
contents
of
the
papers
the
contents
of
the
papers
what
papers
i
looked
at
him
to
see
if
his
seeming
ignorance
of
what
i
meant
was
real
it
appeared
to
be
you
and
i
southam
or
barnes
or
whatever
your
name
is
have
been
and
it
would
seem
still
are
at
cross
purposes
i
take
no
more
interest
in
your
affairs
than
you
take
in
mine
perhaps
not
so
much
the
mention
of
my
name
seems
to
have
awoke
uncomfortable
echoes
in
your
breast
which
fact
is
of
the
nature
of
an
odd
coincidence
you
are
not
a
policeman
or
a
detective
or
a
private
inquiry
agent
or
anything
of
that
kind
you
swear
it
very
willingly
i
am
simply
a
poor
devil
of
a
clerk
out
of
a
situation
why
you
should
object
to
me
or
still
more
why
you
should
fear
me
i
have
not
the
faintest
notion
he
hesitated
before
he
spoke
again
then
his
tone
was
sullen
i
do
know
if
you
are
lying
i
expect
you
are
but
anyhow
chance
it
i
fancy
that
i
about
your
match
if
it
tricks
after
if
i
let
you
get
up
can
i
trust
you
you
can
again
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
he
let
me
rise
when
i
had
done
so
and
was
brushing
the
dust
off
my
clothes
i
took
his
measure
even
by
the
imperfect
light
i
could
see
how
shabby
he
was
and
how
hollow
his
cheeks
were
he
seemed
to
have
shrunk
to
half
his
size
since
that
first
short
interview
i
had
had
with
him
you
will
excuse
my
saying
you
do
look
as
if
you
have
been
living
in
clover
i
have
i
am
nearly
starving
it
is
that
which
has
brought
me
back
why
did
you
ever
go
barnes
tells
me
that
you
are
her
husband
i
should
imagine
that
you
had
a
pretty
comfortable
birth
of
it
he
glowered
at
me
with
renewed
suspicion
oh
she
has
told
you
so
much
has
she
what
has
she
told
you
more
very
little
she
has
been
half
beside
herself
trying
to
think
what
has
become
of
you
especially
since
this
affair
of
duncan
rothwell
we
had
crossed
the
road
and
were
on
the
embankment
walking
towards
the
city
side
by
side
although
i
had
made
the
allusion
of
set
purpose
i
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
effect
which
it
had
on
him
plainly
he
was
a
person
of
ungovernable
impulses
he
stopped
swung
round
again
the
knife
was
gleaming
in
his
grasp
and
his
hand
was
at
my
throat
but
this
time
i
succeeded
in
warding
him
off
what
is
the
matter
with
you
man
are
you
stark
mad
he
was
breathing
in
great
gasps
what
name
was
that
you
said
surely
the
name
must
be
a
familiar
one
to
you
by
now
it
has
been
to
the
front
enough
in
all
the
papers
the
paper
what
papers
the
newspapers
man
of
course
how
do
i
know
what
is
in
the
newspapers
i
never
look
at
them
there
is
nothing
in
them
which
is
of
interest
to
me
what
name
was
that
you
said
tell
me
if
you
dare
he
made
a
threatening
gesture
with
his
knife
seeming
to
be
half
frenzied
with
excitement
duncan
rothwell
the
man
who
was
murdered
at
your
wife
front
door
duncan
rothwell
murdered
at
my
wife
front
door
the
knife
fell
from
his
hand
he
gave
such
a
backward
lurch
that
i
half
expected
to
see
him
fall
down
after
it
in
an
instant
stooping
i
had
the
knife
in
my
grasp
i
felt
strongly
that
such
a
weapon
was
safer
in
my
possession
than
in
his
he
did
not
seem
for
the
moment
to
be
conscious
of
what
it
was
which
he
had
lost
and
i
had
gained
he
stood
staring
in
front
of
him
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
he
repeated
his
own
words
over
to
himself
stammeringly
as
if
he
were
unable
to
catch
their
meaning
murdered
at
my
wife
front
door
where
have
you
been
living
not
to
have
heard
of
it
it
has
been
the
topic
of
every
tongue
i
could
see
that
he
was
struggling
to
collect
his
scattered
senses
he
spoke
at
last
as
if
he
were
waking
from
a
dream
i
have
heard
nothing
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
talking
about
tell
me
everything
i
told
him
all
that
there
was
to
tell
evidently
the
whole
of
it
was
news
to
him
he
listened
greedily
gulping
down
as
it
were
every
word
i
uttered
as
if
i
had
been
feeding
him
with
physical
food
as
well
as
mental
as
i
noted
his
demeanour
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
could
have
been
the
chief
actor
in
the
tragedy
to
the
details
of
which
he
listened
with
such
apparently
unfeigned
amazement
i
had
been
guilty
of
an
unintentional
injustice
in
doubting
him
as
i
told
my
tale
we
leaned
upon
the
parapet
he
never
looking
at
me
once
but
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
river
when
i
had
finished
he
was
silent
for
some
moment
then
he
put
to
me
a
question
do
you
mean
to
say
that
nothing
has
been
found
out
to
show
who
did
it
absolutely
nothing
unless
i
erred
he
smiled
had
i
not
done
him
an
injustice
after
all
could
the
man
be
such
a
consummate
actor
and
yet
you
almost
saw
him
killed
had
i
come
into
the
hall
half
a
moment
sooner
i
might
have
seen
the
murderer
in
the
act
of
perpetrating
his
crime
this
time
he
laughed
right
out
an
evil
laugh
for
goodness
sake
man
do
laugh
like
that
it
makes
me
shiver
he
was
still
with
a
stillness
which
somehow
i
did
not
care
to
break
a
look
began
to
come
into
his
face
he
seemed
to
become
lost
in
thought
when
after
a
long
interval
during
which
i
was
sufficiently
engaged
in
watching
the
different
expressions
which
seem
to
chase
each
other
across
his
face
he
broke
the
silence
it
was
as
though
he
muttered
to
himself
oblivious
of
his
companion
and
of
the
place
in
which
he
was
what
a
woman
she
is
that
was
what
he
said
i
caught
the
words
as
he
uttered
them
beneath
his
breath
uttered
them
as
it
seemed
half
in
admiration
half
in
scorn
and
he
again
was
still
chapter
viii
murderer
he
would
not
go
home
i
spent
i
daresay
an
hour
in
seeking
to
persuade
him
i
pointed
out
the
injury
he
was
doing
to
himself
the
wrong
which
he
was
doing
his
wife
i
went
further
i
more
than
hinted
at
the
suspicions
which
might
fall
upon
him
in
connection
with
the
rothwell
murder
plainly
asserting
that
it
would
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
speak
of
nothing
else
for
him
to
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
scene
look
the
business
squarely
in
the
face
and
see
it
boldly
through
but
he
was
not
to
be
induced
the
most
that
i
could
get
from
him
was
a
promise
that
he
would
come
to
the
front
to
use
his
own
words
when
the
time
was
ripe
what
he
meant
by
them
was
more
than
i
could
tell
in
return
he
extracted
a
promise
from
me
that
i
would
say
nothing
of
our
meeting
to
his
wife
until
he
gave
me
leave
a
promise
which
was
only
given
on
the
strength
of
his
solemn
asseveration
that
such
silence
on
my
part
would
be
best
for
his
wife
sake
and
for
mine
he
would
give
me
no
address
in
reply
to
my
fishing
inquiries
into
the
mystery
of
his
personal
action
he
maintained
an
impenetrable
reserve
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
one
thing
he
did
condescend
to
do
he
borrowed
all
the
loose
cash
which
i
had
in
my
pockets
barnes
had
supplied
me
with
a
latchkey
i
had
been
accustomed
to
let
myself
in
with
it
when
i
was
late
my
surprise
was
therefore
considerable
when
directly
i
inserted
the
key
in
the
lock
the
door
was
opened
from
within
and
there
confronting
me
stood
the
ubiquitous
new
waiter
with
the
inevitable
smile
upon
his
face
what
are
you
sitting
up
for
at
this
hour
of
the
night
you
know
very
well
that
i
have
a
key
of
my
own
he
continued
to
stand
in
the
stiff
attitude
which
always
reminded
me
of
a
soldier
rather
than
of
a
waiter
not
a
muscle
of
his
countenance
moved
i
have
been
accustomed
to
act
as
a
night
porter
sir
then
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
act
as
a
night
porter
to
me
let
me
take
this
opportunity
to
speak
to
you
a
word
of
a
sort
what
is
the
nature
of
the
interest
you
take
in
my
proceedings
i
do
not
know
that
you
do
take
a
peculiar
interest
is
a
little
too
obvious
while
i
remain
in
this
house
i
intend
to
come
and
to
go
and
to
do
exactly
as
i
please
the
next
time
i
have
cause
to
suspect
you
of
spying
upon
my
movements
you
will
be
the
recipient
of
the
best
licking
you
ever
had
in
all
your
life
you
understand
i
shall
keep
my
word
so
you
had
better
make
a
note
of
it
the
fellow
said
nothing
in
return
his
lips
were
closely
pursed
together
i
might
have
been
speaking
to
a
dummy
except
that
there
came
a
gleam
into
his
eyes
which
scarcely
suggested
that
his
heart
was
filled
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
when
i
had
reached
my
bedroom
and
having
undressed
was
opening
my
night
shirt
preparatory
to
putting
it
on
there
fell
from
one
of
the
folds
of
the
garment
a
scrap
of
paper
what
now
i
asked
myself
as
i
watched
it
go
fluttering
to
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
it
only
contained
four
words
and
they
were
in
barnes
writing
you
are
in
danger
this
veritably
was
an
hotel
of
all
the
mysteries
whether
the
husband
or
the
wife
was
the
more
curious
character
was
certainly
an
open
question
for
days
she
had
avoided
me
in
spite
of
my
attempts
to
induce
her
to
enter
into
conversation
i
had
scarcely
been
able
to
get
a
word
out
of
her
edgeways
why
had
she
chosen
this
eccentric
method
of
conveying
to
me
such
an
enigmatic
message
i
was
in
danger
of
what
it
struck
me
forcibly
and
not
for
the
first
time
that
if
i
remained
much
longer
an
inmate
of
barnes
hotel
i
should
be
in
distinct
danger
of
one
thing
of
going
mad
i
had
still
some
papers
left
to
copy
out
of
the
last
batch
which
had
given
me
i
had
been
accustomed
to
do
my
work
in
her
private
it
being
my
habit
as
i
understood
it
in
accordance
with
her
wish
first
to
have
breakfast
and
then
to
go
upstairs
and
ask
her
if
she
was
prepared
for
me
to
commence
my
duties
the
next
morning
i
followed
the
ordinary
course
of
procedure
and
was
at
her
door
if
anything
rather
before
the
usual
hour
but
instead
of
vouchsafing
me
a
courteous
greeting
as
it
was
her
wont
to
do
she
commenced
to
rate
me
soundly
asking
me
if
i
thought
that
her
time
was
of
no
account
since
i
kept
her
waiting
till
it
suited
me
to
give
her
my
attention
i
made
no
attempt
to
excuse
myself
imagining
that
she
was
suffering
from
an
attack
of
indigestion
or
from
some
other
complaint
which
female
flesh
is
peculiarly
heir
to
contenting
myself
with
repeating
my
inquiry
as
to
whether
she
was
ready
to
avail
herself
of
my
proffered
services
the
fashion
of
her
rejoinder
hardly
suggested
that
the
lady
who
made
it
was
stamped
with
the
stamp
which
is
poetically
supposed
to
mark
the
caste
of
vere
de
vere
do
ask
me
such
absurd
questions
you
do
suppose
that
i
the
servant
and
you
the
master
sit
down
and
begin
your
work
at
once
and
do
try
any
of
your
airs
with
me
i
sat
down
and
began
my
work
at
once
it
was
not
for
me
to
argue
with
a
lady
beggars
may
not
be
choosers
and
i
could
only
hope
that
the
infirmities
of
a
feminine
temper
might
not
be
too
frequently
in
evidence
as
a
sort
of
honorary
addition
to
the
charms
of
my
salary
that
the
lady
meant
to
be
disagreeable
i
could
have
no
doubt
as
the
minutes
went
by
and
scarcely
had
i
commenced
to
write
than
she
began
at
me
again
she
found
fault
with
my
work
with
what
i
had
done
with
what
i
had
left
undone
as
it
seemed
to
me
quite
causelessly
i
bore
her
reproaches
as
meekly
as
the
mildest
mortal
could
have
done
my
meekness
seemed
to
inflame
rather
than
to
appease
her
she
said
things
which
were
altogether
uncalled
for
and
which
beyond
doubt
an
office
boy
would
have
resented
that
i
should
keep
my
temper
in
face
of
her
continued
provocation
evidently
annoyed
her
suddenly
springing
out
of
her
chair
she
bounced
from
the
room
i
trust
i
said
apostrophising
her
when
she
had
gone
that
when
you
do
return
your
temperature
will
be
appreciably
lower
in
any
case
i
fancy
that
you
and
i
shall
not
long
stand
towards
each
other
in
the
position
of
employee
and
employer
even
by
a
lady
one
does
not
care
to
be
called
over
the
coals
and
such
coals
for
nothing
at
all
one
had
almost
better
starve
than
be
treated
in
and
out
of
season
as
a
whipping
boy
the
papers
which
i
was
engaged
in
copying
comprised
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
more
worthy
i
should
have
thought
of
the
rubbish
heap
than
of
transcription
they
were
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
were
in
no
sort
of
order
and
why
they
should
be
deemed
worthy
of
being
enshrined
in
the
beautiful
manuscript
book
with
which
had
supplied
me
was
beyond
my
comprehension
i
had
finished
transcribing
one
paper
laying
it
down
i
drew
towards
me
another
it
was
a
letter
and
was
in
a
hand
which
i
had
not
previously
encountered
the
caligraphy
even
the
paper
on
which
the
letter
was
written
filled
me
with
a
strange
sense
of
familiarity
where
had
i
seen
that
carefully
crabbed
characteristic
handwriting
before
every
letter
as
plain
as
copperplate
yet
the
whole
conveying
the
impression
of
coming
from
an
unlettered
man
i
had
had
a
previous
acquaintance
with
it
and
that
quite
recently
i
had
it
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
of
memory
the
writing
was
that
which
had
come
to
me
in
the
communication
which
had
been
signed
duncan
rothwell
this
letter
and
that
letter
had
emanated
from
the
same
scribe
i
could
have
sworn
to
it
even
the
paper
was
the
same
i
remembered
taking
particular
notice
of
the
large
sheet
of
post
with
the
unusually
coarse
grain
here
was
that
twin
brother
what
was
a
letter
from
duncan
rothwell
doing
among
papers
it
was
my
duty
to
copy
the
thing
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
i
should
read
it
it
bore
no
date
and
no
address
it
began
my
dearest
amelia
who
was
my
dearest
amelia
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
me
that
it
was
a
and
a
of
an
uncommon
kind
clearly
there
had
been
some
blunder
such
an
epistle
could
not
intentionally
have
been
lumped
with
that
olla
podrida
of
scraps
and
scrawls
it
was
out
of
place
in
such
a
gallery
what
was
i
to
do
the
question
was
answered
for
me
while
i
still
hesitated
reappeared
i
said
nothing
but
i
daresay
that
the
expression
of
my
features
and
the
gingerly
style
in
which
i
held
the
letter
out
in
front
of
me
conveyed
a
hint
that
i
had
lighted
on
something
out
of
the
way
probably
too
she
recognised
the
letter
directly
she
caught
sight
of
it
even
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
anyhow
she
came
striding
forward
she
was
a
woman
who
could
stride
and
without
any
sort
of
ceremony
leaning
across
the
table
she
snatched
it
from
my
hand
for
an
instant
i
expected
she
would
strike
me
she
was
in
such
a
passion
the
veins
stood
out
on
her
brow
like
bands
her
lips
gave
convulsive
twitches
since
it
seemed
that
rage
had
deprived
her
of
the
faculty
of
speech
i
endeavoured
to
explain
the
situation
by
feigning
ignorance
that
there
was
a
situation
to
explain
do
you
wish
me
to
copy
this
letter
in
the
same
way
as
the
others
my
voice
was
suave
hers
when
it
came
was
not
you
beast
that
was
the
epithet
which
she
was
pleased
to
hurl
at
me
i
might
have
guessed
you
were
a
thief
madam
her
language
was
so
atrocious
and
her
anger
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
so
unjustifiable
that
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
her
where
did
you
steal
that
letter
i
stood
up
you
go
too
far
you
appear
to
be
under
the
i
assure
you
erroneous
impression
that
in
engaging
a
man
to
fill
the
honourable
post
of
your
secretary
you
buy
him
body
and
soul
to
do
as
you
will
you
hound
do
think
to
play
the
hypocrite
with
me
or
you
will
find
yourself
in
custody
on
a
charge
of
theft
i
looked
her
steadily
in
the
face
fury
seemed
to
have
distended
her
naturally
generous
proportions
i
fear
madam
that
this
morning
you
are
suffering
from
when
you
are
yourself
again
i
feel
sure
you
will
tender
your
apologies
i
moved
towards
the
door
but
she
would
not
let
me
go
she
placed
herself
in
front
of
me
do
think
that
you
deceive
me
do
think
that
your
attitudinising
can
impose
on
me
if
you
do
you
are
in
error
i
have
known
you
from
the
first
yes
before
i
saw
you
in
the
actual
flesh
i
knew
jonas
hartopp
as
well
as
you
and
when
he
fell
i
swore
that
i
would
gibbet
the
wretch
who
slew
him
all
this
time
i
have
been
watching
you
the
avenger
of
blood
i
have
been
tracking
you
step
by
step
playing
the
very
it
only
needs
a
very
little
to
enable
me
to
prove
your
guilt
up
to
the
hilt
and
you
may
be
very
sure
of
this
james
southam
that
though
you
seek
to
hide
yourself
in
the
nethermost
corners
of
the
earth
i
will
have
you
brought
back
to
hang
her
words
were
so
wild
and
the
charge
with
which
she
sought
to
brand
me
such
a
monstrous
birth
of
a
diseased
imagination
that
the
most
charitable
supposition
could
be
that
the
woman
was
mentally
unhinged
i
treated
her
with
the
contempt
she
merited
possibly
madam
when
at
your
leisure
you
have
credited
me
with
all
the
vices
you
will
suffer
me
to
leave
the
room
that
is
the
tone
you
take
up
you
sneer
and
sneer
and
sneer
i
foresaw
it
do
not
suppose
that
this
further
proof
of
your
deficiency
in
all
sense
of
shame
takes
me
by
surprise
so
a
villain
was
not
likely
to
have
a
conscience
which
could
be
easily
pricked
you
may
go
still
this
once
it
will
not
be
for
long
your
wings
will
soon
be
clipped
i
shall
soon
have
you
in
a
cage
be
sure
of
this
i
will
show
you
as
little
mercy
as
you
showed
your
helpless
victim
when
he
had
walked
into
the
trap
which
you
had
set
for
him
you
had
best
be
careful
and
never
forget
that
wherever
you
go
my
emissaries
keep
you
well
in
sight
whatever
you
do
is
known
to
me
within
the
hour
i
have
no
intention
of
letting
the
cord
which
holds
you
run
too
loose
when
she
stopped
to
take
breath
i
bowed
i
thank
you
madam
for
your
permission
to
leave
the
room
and
do
protest
that
i
esteem
myself
highly
honoured
in
that
you
should
take
so
acute
an
interest
as
you
say
you
do
in
my
humble
person
she
let
me
go
though
seemingly
not
a
little
against
her
will
even
at
the
last
moment
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
assailed
me
with
actual
physical
violence
but
she
retained
sufficient
vestiges
of
to
refrain
from
doing
that
when
i
opened
the
door
she
caught
hold
of
the
handle
to
prevent
my
shutting
it
as
i
went
out
she
followed
me
on
to
the
landing
i
supposing
she
desired
to
go
downstairs
moved
aside
so
as
to
permit
of
her
passage
she
took
no
notice
of
my
action
so
i
went
downstairs
as
i
went
she
stood
at
the
head
of
the
flight
observing
me
as
i
descended
and
she
said
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
was
too
audible
to
be
pleasant
for
me
murderer
chapter
ix
thrown
in
her
face
i
must
admit
that
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
keep
up
the
outward
semblance
of
indifference
when
i
reached
the
hall
i
was
at
a
loss
what
next
to
do
a
man
scarcely
ever
has
a
passage
of
arms
with
an
angry
woman
without
suffering
some
loss
of
dignity
and
that
no
matter
how
much
in
the
right
he
is
i
had
a
mine
sprung
on
me
from
a
wholly
unexpected
quarter
i
had
been
accused
of
being
an
assassin
by
the
woman
who
for
at
any
rate
one
sanguine
second
i
had
fondly
fancied
was
about
to
play
the
part
of
my
good
fairy
and
now
as
i
was
endeavouring
with
the
finest
air
of
conscious
rectitude
which
i
had
at
my
command
to
remove
myself
from
the
lash
of
her
vigorous
tongue
she
had
thrown
after
me
in
public
that
hideous
epithet
i
was
aware
that
the
maid
with
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
was
peeping
at
me
from
the
banisters
above
while
standing
stolidly
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
that
much
too
attentive
waiter
as
he
moved
to
let
me
pass
i
was
always
fond
of
names
being
persuaded
that
they
were
invariably
marks
of
birth
and
breeding
gave
me
an
assurance
that
i
was
still
in
range
she
addressed
the
waiter
with
perfect
spontaneity
you
may
let
him
go
my
man
for
the
present
but
his
course
is
nearly
run
and
he
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
sooner
than
he
thinks
i
did
not
feel
myself
entitled
to
knock
the
man
down
because
the
woman
insulted
me
though
my
inclination
went
that
way
i
was
still
less
disposed
to
turn
and
slang
her
back
again
being
convinced
that
in
such
a
contest
i
should
not
be
her
equal
my
impulse
was
to
seek
out
barnes
as
the
landlady
and
therefore
responsible
for
all
that
took
place
in
her
establishment
and
submit
my
grievances
to
her
but
a
glimpse
that
i
caught
of
her
beating
a
precipitate
retreat
into
her
sanctum
directly
she
saw
me
glance
in
her
direction
informed
me
that
such
a
mode
of
procedure
would
be
worse
than
vain
i
turned
into
the
then
feeling
that
i
must
go
somewhere
to
cool
my
brain
i
quitted
it
almost
immediately
to
sally
forth
into
the
street
i
had
brought
my
wares
to
a
pretty
market
disaster
seemed
to
be
heaped
upon
disaster
head
might
be
mad
but
there
seemed
to
be
method
in
her
madness
and
if
she
really
was
possessed
by
the
fixed
idea
that
i
was
an
assassin
though
i
might
not
stand
in
actual
peril
of
my
life
i
could
hardly
be
in
a
more
awkward
situation
no
wonder
i
had
felt
towards
her
an
instinctive
antagonism
even
when
she
had
appeared
to
be
most
friendly
i
was
not
sure
that
i
had
done
wrong
in
not
seeking
to
rebut
even
the
wildest
of
her
wild
words
with
a
greater
show
of
gravity
the
levity
with
which
i
had
received
them
might
be
urged
against
me
if
it
came
to
an
arrest
an
arrest
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
climax
i
involuntarily
stood
still
cold
sweat
was
on
my
brow
i
remembered
what
had
said
about
her
emissaries
being
always
on
my
track
for
some
time
past
i
had
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
my
footsteps
were
being
dogged
and
that
i
was
being
watched
i
turned
to
see
if
any
one
was
shadowing
me
now
he
would
have
a
bad
time
of
it
if
i
found
him
i
noted
no
one
whose
obvious
attentions
i
could
resent
but
then
i
was
in
the
strand
in
that
busy
thoroughfare
the
merest
tyro
could
ply
his
trade
of
spy
without
fear
of
premature
detection
i
turned
towards
waterloo
bridge
a
sudden
thought
striking
me
as
i
did
so
i
would
go
for
advice
to
cleaver
and
caxton
it
was
through
them
in
the
first
place
i
had
got
into
this
scrape
it
ought
to
be
their
business
to
get
me
out
of
it
i
went
though
i
might
have
saved
myself
the
trouble
they
expressed
their
willingness
to
undertake
my
defence
if
it
came
to
that
and
if
funds
were
forthcoming
but
so
far
from
giving
me
the
sort
of
advice
i
wanted
advice
which
would
enable
me
to
escape
the
dreadful
ordeal
of
the
prisoner
dock
i
could
see
from
their
manner
if
not
from
their
words
that
they
thought
it
as
likely
as
not
that
i
was
guilty
of
the
crime
which
as
it
seemed
was
about
to
be
imputed
against
me
i
left
them
feeling
very
little
reassured
and
sick
at
heart
returned
to
the
hotel
on
one
point
i
was
finally
resolved
under
that
roof
i
would
not
sleep
another
night
after
what
had
happened
in
the
morning
even
barnes
would
not
have
the
hardihood
to
suggest
that
i
should
continue
with
her
any
longer
even
as
a
gratuitous
guest
i
went
straight
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
meaning
to
put
the
few
things
together
which
were
mine
and
then
and
only
then
i
would
have
an
interview
and
an
explanation
with
barnes
this
was
my
programme
but
like
so
many
other
programmes
i
had
arranged
it
was
not
destined
to
be
carried
out
directly
i
reached
the
bedroom
door
i
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
inside
supposing
it
was
the
maid
who
was
performing
her
necessary
routine
duties
i
unceremoniously
entered
the
person
within
was
not
however
the
attendant
abigail
it
was
a
man
he
lay
on
his
stomach
on
the
floor
with
half
his
length
beneath
the
bed
it
was
the
new
waiter
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
nature
of
his
occupation
i
had
caught
him
in
the
act
so
engrossed
was
he
with
his
researches
that
before
he
had
realised
my
presence
i
had
my
knee
on
the
small
of
his
back
and
a
stick
in
my
hand
as
you
would
take
my
friendly
warning
take
that
i
brought
the
stick
down
smartly
on
the
nether
portion
of
his
frame
he
had
woke
to
the
consciousness
of
what
was
happening
at
last
with
agility
twisting
himself
partially
free
he
scrambled
from
beneath
the
bed
i
continuing
as
he
struggled
to
get
in
my
blows
wherever
i
could
stop
this
he
gasped
or
you
regret
it
i
fancy
i
retorted
that
the
regret
will
be
yours
he
showed
more
fight
than
i
had
expected
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
after
all
the
whipping
might
not
be
confined
to
one
side
only
but
my
blood
was
up
i
was
not
likely
to
allow
such
trifles
to
affect
me
all
at
once
just
as
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
bringing
down
on
him
the
best
blow
of
any
he
caught
my
wrist
and
gave
it
a
sharp
wrench
which
numbed
the
muscles
of
my
arm
as
if
they
had
been
attacked
by
temporary
paralysis
you
fool
he
said
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
are
doing
i
am
an
officer
of
police
and
i
arrest
you
on
a
charge
of
murder
he
had
taken
my
breath
away
with
a
vengeance
i
gazed
at
him
askance
it
is
false
you
are
one
of
that
woman
spies
i
am
nothing
or
the
kind
as
a
shrewd
man
like
you
ought
to
be
aware
i
have
had
this
case
in
hand
from
the
first
i
came
here
to
play
the
part
of
a
waiter
with
the
special
intention
of
keeping
an
eye
on
you
and
i
have
kept
an
eye
upon
you
i
fancy
to
some
purpose
it
all
a
lie
do
talk
nonsense
the
game
is
up
my
lad
and
you
know
it
the
question
is
are
you
going
to
come
quietly
or
am
i
to
use
the
bracelets
i
can
get
plenty
of
assistance
i
assure
you
if
i
choose
to
call
if
you
can
prove
to
me
the
truth
of
what
you
say
and
can
show
me
that
you
really
are
an
officer
of
police
i
can
have
no
objection
to
your
doing
what
you
conceive
to
be
your
duty
though
i
declare
to
you
as
there
is
a
god
above
us
that
in
arresting
me
you
are
making
a
grievous
mistake
the
fellow
eyed
me
with
what
struck
me
as
being
a
grin
of
genuine
admiration
you
a
neat
hand
i
never
saw
a
chap
carry
a
thing
off
neater
though
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
anything
which
you
may
say
will
be
used
against
you
but
you
made
a
slight
mistake
my
lad
perhaps
you
did
think
i
found
it
he
picked
up
something
from
the
coverlet
it
was
a
long
thin
blade
of
a
fashion
which
i
had
never
seen
before
it
had
a
point
of
exquisite
fineness
here
and
there
the
gleaming
steel
was
obscured
by
what
seemed
stains
of
rust
perhaps
it
is
owing
to
my
stupidity
that
i
am
unable
to
grasp
your
meaning
this
is
not
mine
nor
have
i
seen
it
before
have
you
that
remains
to
be
seen
unless
i
am
out
of
my
calculations
i
shall
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
that
knife
killed
jonas
hartopp
oddly
enough
i
found
it
just
as
you
were
coming
into
the
room
inside
the
wainscotting
in
a
little
slit
in
the
wall
which
was
not
half
badly
concealed
and
which
was
hidden
by
your
bed
i
rather
reckon
that
that
small
bit
of
evidence
will
just
round
my
case
up
nicely
if
it
is
true
that
you
found
it
where
you
say
you
did
i
can
only
assert
that
i
do
not
know
who
put
it
there
i
certainly
did
not
no
that
is
a
point
which
must
be
left
open
for
further
consideration
now
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
to
walk
downstairs
you
perfectly
understand
southam
that
you
are
my
prisoner
the
bedroom
door
in
the
hurry
of
my
entrance
had
been
left
wide
open
turning
i
perceived
that
was
staring
in
at
us
your
prisoner
she
echoed
the
fellow
words
southam
is
your
prisoner
who
then
are
you
she
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
as
if
to
control
her
agitation
i
am
a
detective
and
you
have
arrested
southam
for
what
for
the
murder
of
jonas
hartopp
she
clasped
her
hands
together
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
i
am
so
glad
so
glad
i
congratulate
you
sir
on
having
brought
the
crime
home
to
the
real
criminal
at
last
she
addressed
me
with
an
air
of
triumph
which
was
wholly
unconcealed
did
i
not
tell
you
that
your
course
was
nearly
run
it
was
nearer
its
close
even
than
i
thought
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
prognostication
madam
but
i
may
assure
you
that
though
i
am
not
the
first
person
who
has
been
wrongfully
accused
of
a
crime
of
which
he
was
completely
innocent
i
do
venture
to
indulge
in
a
hope
that
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
a
woman
has
permitted
herself
to
gloat
over
the
misfortunes
of
a
man
who
without
having
wronged
a
living
creature
is
himself
friendless
helpless
and
injured
so
far
from
my
words
succeeding
in
reaching
the
sympathetic
side
of
her
if
she
had
one
she
glared
at
me
if
it
were
possible
more
malignantly
than
before
you
hypocrite
she
hissed
my
captor
placed
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
come
he
said
in
a
tone
which
was
unmistakably
official
it
is
no
use
staying
here
to
bandy
words
downstairs
southam
if
you
please
and
mind
no
tricks
upon
the
way
i
told
him
that
he
need
not
apprehend
anything
in
the
nature
of
what
he
called
tricks
from
me
we
went
downstairs
close
at
our
heels
step
into
the
southam
if
you
please
i
am
going
to
send
for
a
cab
mrs
barnes
that
lady
appeared
i
have
effected
this
man
capture
as
i
told
you
that
i
probably
should
do
so
she
had
known
all
along
who
he
was
and
in
concealing
the
fact
in
a
sense
had
betrayed
me
and
this
was
the
meaning
of
her
futile
attempt
at
warning
of
the
night
before
let
me
have
a
cab
at
once
and
allow
no
one
to
enter
this
bedroom
until
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
all
that
it
contains
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
i
saw
that
barnes
head
was
nodding
like
a
chinese
mandarin
and
that
it
was
set
in
motion
evidently
by
the
agitated
condition
of
her
nerves
the
detective
perceived
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
repeat
his
instructions
if
he
wished
them
to
be
acted
on
now
then
barnes
pull
yourself
together
let
me
have
that
cab
as
barnes
moved
aside
with
the
possible
intention
of
taking
steps
to
execute
the
officer
commands
i
observed
that
some
one
was
standing
at
her
back
it
was
her
husband
he
stood
just
inside
the
hall
door
as
if
he
had
just
come
in
and
was
wondering
what
was
taking
place
he
was
as
shabbily
and
as
poorly
dressed
as
he
very
well
could
have
been
but
there
was
something
in
his
face
and
in
his
bearing
which
for
some
reason
which
i
will
not
stay
to
fathom
brought
good
hope
into
my
heart
it
you
thank
god
i
cried
they
have
arrested
me
for
murder
i
hope
you
have
come
to
help
me
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
they
turned
to
see
to
whom
it
was
i
was
speaking
when
barnes
saw
her
husband
without
any
sort
of
notice
she
broke
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
laughing
and
screaming
and
kicking
all
at
once
so
that
the
maid
had
to
hold
her
tightly
round
the
waist
to
prevent
her
making
an
untimely
descent
to
the
ground
but
there
was
one
person
on
whom
his
sudden
appearance
seemed
to
have
an
even
greater
effect
than
it
had
on
barnes
and
that
was
when
she
realised
who
it
was
who
had
come
so
unexpectedly
on
the
scene
she
began
to
stare
at
him
as
if
he
exercised
over
her
the
fabulous
fascination
of
the
snake
she
shrank
from
before
his
glance
crouching
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
she
seemed
to
actually
diminish
in
size
you
you
she
gasped
no
no
not
you
she
put
up
her
hands
as
if
to
ward
him
off
her
as
he
made
a
forward
movement
one
could
see
that
she
shivered
as
if
in
mortal
terror
and
you
he
said
with
an
intensity
of
meaning
in
his
voice
of
which
i
had
not
thought
it
capable
and
you
he
turned
to
me
pointing
an
accusatory
finger
at
the
woman
in
whose
bearing
so
strange
a
metamorphosis
had
taken
place
if
you
had
told
me
last
night
that
she
was
here
i
would
have
solved
the
mystery
for
you
there
and
then
her
presence
here
makes
the
thing
as
clear
as
daylight
it
was
she
who
killed
duncan
rothwell
acknowledge
it
you
woman
with
the
hand
he
addressed
her
with
a
gesture
of
terrible
denunciation
his
stature
seemed
to
have
magnified
even
as
the
woman
seemed
to
have
decreased
his
face
and
eyes
were
blazing
i
understood
then
how
it
came
about
that
he
had
mesmerised
poor
nerveless
barnes
no
wailed
no
i
never
touched
him
you
dare
to
deny
it
in
the
man
voice
there
seemed
to
be
a
wonderful
resonance
in
his
bearing
a
singular
air
of
command
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
box
and
from
wrappings
in
the
box
the
ghastly
relics
which
still
haunted
barnes
in
dreams
here
are
the
four
fingers
and
the
thumb
and
the
palm
of
your
right
hand
woman
with
which
you
would
have
made
an
end
of
me
clearly
therefore
it
was
with
your
left
hand
that
you
murdered
duncan
rothwell
deny
it
if
you
dare
as
he
spoke
he
threw
at
her
the
dreadful
fragments
they
struck
her
full
in
the
face
i
did
it
i
own
it
do
touch
me
not
that
she
screamed
she
fell
to
the
ground
as
with
amazement
and
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
with
horror
we
stared
at
her
in
what
proved
to
be
an
epileptic
fit
chapter
x
the
jewel
king
the
story
of
duncan
rothwell
murder
when
it
came
to
be
unfolded
in
a
court
of
law
proved
to
be
not
the
least
strange
of
the
many
strange
tales
which
have
been
unfolded
there
its
turnings
and
twistings
and
involutions
were
many
but
briefly
summed
up
it
came
to
this
the
man
who
had
married
the
landlady
of
that
hotel
in
the
turning
off
the
strand
and
who
in
marrying
her
had
brought
such
havoc
on
her
head
turned
out
to
be
a
man
with
many
names
what
his
real
name
was
if
he
ever
had
one
was
never
clearly
shown
but
there
had
been
a
time
during
which
the
name
by
which
he
had
been
best
known
to
a
certain
section
of
society
had
been
that
of
the
jewel
king
he
had
been
the
perpetrator
of
most
of
the
remarkable
jewel
robberies
which
have
so
much
disturbed
society
during
recent
years
a
scamp
in
short
on
a
truly
notorious
scale
jonas
hartopp
had
played
receiver
to
his
thief
these
two
had
been
really
remarkable
men
men
of
parts
which
fortunately
for
the
world
at
large
are
not
often
found
joined
in
two
individuals
for
years
these
two
had
been
close
friends
colleagues
with
souls
but
for
a
single
thought
which
thing
was
plunder
until
a
woman
came
between
this
was
the
woman
who
has
figured
in
these
pages
as
but
whose
real
patronymic
was
shown
to
be
rather
more
plebeian
amelia
martin
the
man
who
for
the
sake
of
convenience
i
will
continue
to
call
barnes
was
in
his
way
a
genius
and
a
little
mad
he
lived
for
a
long
time
with
amelia
martin
as
her
husband
without
ever
having
married
her
it
is
probable
that
during
the
whole
of
this
period
the
woman
was
in
a
state
of
daily
and
hourly
terror
he
had
a
pleasant
habit
of
playing
tricks
with
women
particularly
mesmeric
tricks
of
a
sort
which
would
hardly
have
endeared
any
husband
to
any
wife
it
was
seriously
alleged
for
instance
that
on
a
monday
he
would
throw
her
into
a
mesmeric
sleep
and
leave
her
quite
alone
in
the
house
and
in
a
state
of
trance
until
he
returned
on
the
saturday
to
restore
her
at
his
leisure
very
much
at
his
leisure
to
a
condition
of
consciousness
thus
she
was
continually
losing
large
slices
out
of
her
life
under
circumstances
which
no
one
could
describe
as
wholly
satisfactory
by
degrees
she
transferred
her
affections
to
jonas
hartopp
and
with
them
she
decided
to
transfer
herself
as
well
barnes
had
just
made
a
great
coup
the
world
will
remember
the
disappearance
of
the
countess
of
crawley
wedding
presents
barnes
walked
away
from
crawley
house
with
those
priceless
gems
packed
comfortably
away
in
his
pockets
amelia
martin
persuaded
jonas
hartopp
to
rob
his
friend
if
in
a
little
transaction
of
that
peculiar
kind
one
may
speak
of
robbery
she
offered
hartopp
the
countess
gems
for
nothing
if
he
would
take
her
with
them
in
a
weak
moment
hartopp
yielded
to
temptation
unfortunately
barnes
detected
her
in
the
very
act
of
flight
she
struck
a
blow
for
freedom
with
a
knife
the
injury
which
she
inflicted
was
however
a
superficial
one
before
she
could
strike
again
he
had
her
in
a
mesmeric
sleep
while
she
was
in
that
state
he
cut
off
at
the
wrist
her
right
hand
the
one
with
which
she
had
tried
to
stab
him
restoring
her
he
showed
her
what
he
had
done
in
her
agony
she
vowed
that
she
would
turn
queen
evidence
and
betray
him
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
police
let
the
consequences
to
herself
be
what
they
might
in
short
she
made
herself
so
extremely
disagreeable
that
all
things
considered
barnes
thought
it
the
better
part
of
wisdom
to
decamp
it
was
while
he
was
in
full
flight
that
he
lighted
on
that
hotel
in
the
street
off
the
strand
on
the
landlady
of
which
he
so
generously
and
rapidly
bestowed
the
name
of
barnes
he
perfectly
realised
that
his
friend
and
his
mistress
were
leagued
together
against
him
and
he
took
it
that
barnes
hotel
would
form
a
convenient
and
cover
until
such
time
as
he
saw
his
way
to
crying
quits
with
the
pair
it
is
here
that
the
odd
part
of
the
story
begins
having
its
origin
in
one
of
those
freaks
of
coincidence
which
after
all
are
not
so
common
in
fiction
as
they
are
in
actual
life
and
are
certainly
not
stranger
the
barnes
had
in
his
palmy
days
taken
up
his
residence
for
business
purposes
of
all
places
in
the
world
at
dulborough
finding
that
there
had
been
a
james
southam
thereabouts
and
conceiving
that
it
would
be
as
well
in
case
of
accidents
that
the
credit
of
his
misdeeds
should
stand
a
chance
of
being
fathered
on
the
real
james
southam
instead
of
on
the
false
one
he
had
not
only
taken
to
himself
my
name
but
had
actually
located
himself
in
the
house
in
which
i
had
been
bred
and
born
jonas
hartopp
regretted
his
treachery
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
played
the
traitor
either
he
did
not
find
the
lady
such
a
good
bargain
as
he
thought
he
should
or
at
any
rate
not
a
commensurate
exchange
for
the
good
offices
of
his
ingenious
and
profitable
friend
he
decided
after
a
while
to
extend
the
olive
branch
towards
his
whilom
colleague
it
was
with
that
idea
in
view
that
he
had
inserted
the
advertisement
addressed
to
james
southam
of
dulborough
which
had
caught
my
eye
under
the
circumstances
when
the
barnes
acting
his
of
waiter
heard
the
stranger
on
whom
he
was
attending
pronounce
his
quondam
cognomen
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
philistines
had
tracked
him
to
his
lair
and
that
in
consequence
he
turned
tail
and
ran
amelia
martin
having
played
the
part
of
traitor
herself
was
quick
at
suspecting
intended
treachery
in
another
she
had
an
inkling
of
what
it
was
jonas
hartopp
duncan
rothwell
proposed
to
do
the
pair
had
a
violent
quarrel
the
night
before
he
went
to
town
she
followed
him
without
his
being
conscious
of
the
fact
on
that
eventful
journey
in
a
dangerous
mood
and
in
what
doubtless
was
a
moment
half
of
fear
and
half
of
frenzy
she
struck
him
dead
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
and
the
discovery
that
there
was
a
real
james
southam
in
the
world
and
that
duncan
rothwell
therefore
had
started
on
a
futile
quest
gave
her
the
idea
of
removing
suspicion
from
herself
by
attributing
the
crime
to
me
which
ingenious
plan
she
might
have
carried
to
a
successful
issue
and
i
been
hanged
for
what
i
never
had
the
faintest
thought
of
doing
if
the
false
james
southam
had
not
come
on
the
scene
in
the
very
nick
of
time
it
was
she
who
placed
the
knife
with
which
she
had
done
the
deed
behind
the
wainscot
in
my
bedroom
the
trial
of
amelia
martin
for
the
murder
of
jonas
hartopp
during
which
this
tale
was
unfolded
continued
for
a
week
on
her
behalf
medical
evidence
was
brought
to
show
that
she
suffered
from
periodical
attacks
of
mania
during
which
she
could
not
justly
be
held
responsible
for
her
actions
for
which
condition
of
affairs
barnes
mesmeric
experiments
had
probably
something
to
do
she
was
sentenced
to
be
confined
as
a
criminal
lunatic

her
pleasure
barnes
suicide
in
his
cell
on
the
night
before
he
was
to
be
brought
to

for
in
spite
of
the
assistance
which
he
rendered
in
the
case
of
amelia
martin
the
police
apparently
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
go
scot
free
was
the
sensation
of
a
special
edition
barnes
sold
the
hotel
and
retired
into
private
life
at
present
i
believe
she
is
residing
with
some
relatives
in
a
corner
of

as
for
me
i
still
seem
very
far
from
being
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
making
of

but
at
any

i

not

laid

down
and
thrust

into

back
in

and
began
to
whistle
softly
beneath

to
marry
her
a
decent
sort
of

though
upon
my
word
if

is
to
go

he
glanced
at
the

with
a
look
of
mild
despair
i
mind
who
it
is
she
knows
i
hate
letters
that
why
she
keeps
on
writing
them
if
two
men
ca
know
each
other
without
one
of
them
dying
and
leaving
the
other
with
his

on

a
man
likes
to
keep

when
the

got

god
help
the
man
who
got
to

her
well
here
goes
i
suppose
i
have
to

it
or
she
be
writing

taking
up

he
regarded
it
with
a
look
of
ineffable
disgust
what
she
says
i
do
know
rather
than
decipher

here
goes
to
make
the
best
of
it
drawing
towards

a

of

he
began
to
nibble

of
the

what
the

shall
i
say
how
can
a
man
answer
a
letter
when
he
does
know
what
is
in

he
began
to
write
indulging
in
a
sort
or
commentary
by
the
way
my
dear
lily
i
have
read
your
charming
letter
with
the
greatest
interest
i
have
i
have
you
are
indeed
a
mistress
of
the
epistolary
art
i
hope
she
wo
imagine

writ
sarkastick
now
what
shall
i
say
the
account
which
you
give
of
the
doings
of

i
hope
that
safe
it
ought
to
be
women
always
do
talk
about
that
kind
of
thing
is
most
entertaining
most
it
is
with
the
greatest
pleasure
that
i
hear
of
your
continuance
in
good
health
i
wonder
if
she
says
anything
about
her
being
ill
i
am
glad
to
hear
too
that
your
aunt
clive
is
still
in
the
enjoyment
of
nature
greatest
blessing
i
wonder
if
she
mentions
the
old
name
pray
convey
to
her
my
compliments
old
fool
now
for
something
to
wind
up
with
i
envy
you
your
peaceful
sojourn
amidst
scenic
splendours
not
so
bad
scenic
splendours
tied
as
i
am
to
the
juggernaut
of

i
can
however
but
look
and
long
i
would
live
in
a
place
like
that
for
thirty
thousand
a
year
your
affectionate
guardian
john
ash
i
think
that
do
it
will
at
any
rate
prevent

writing
again
to
know
if
i
am
while
he
was
examining
with
a
certain
satisfaction
this
example
of
polite
correspondence
a
voice
was
heard
inquiring
for
him
in
the
office
without
ash
in
when
ash
heard
the
voice
an
acidulated
expression
appeared
upon
his
countenance
ely
what
does
the
fool
want
here
it
not
so
very
long
ago
since
i
very
nearly
had
to
hurt
his
head
all
right
you
need
trouble
him
i
show
myself
in
the
owner
of
the
voice
did
show
himself
in
he
was
a
dapper
little
man
with
fair
hair
and
a
little
fair
moustache
the
ends
of
which
were
arranged
with
the
utmost
nicety
and
a
pair
of
rather
blue
eyes
which
could
however
look
keen
enough
when
they
pleased
he
was
what
might
be
described
as
a
bandbox
sort
of
man
beautiful
grey
trousers
fitted
over
exquisite
patent
shoes
a
spotless
white
waistcoat
relieved
an
irreproachable
black
coat
his
necktie
was
arranged
in
an
absolutely
perfect
little
bow
his
hat
gleamed
as
though
it
had
just
that
moment
left
the
manufacturer
hands
he
carried
a
metal
and
one
of
those
long
thin
which
gentlemen
of
the
stock
exchange
use
to
enter
their
bargains
in
a
diamond
ring
sparkled
on
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
in
the
of
his
coat
backed
by
a
sprig
of
was
a
sweet
this
beautiful
little
gentleman
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
and
all
the
world
surprised
to
see
me
i
daresay
his
rather
metallic
voice
did
not
altogether
accord
with
the
radiancy
of
his
appearance
one
expected
notes
to
come
from
him
his
actual
tones
were
sharp
and
shrill
i
am
considering
that
last
time
i
had
the
privilege
of
your
conversation
you
were
good
enough
to
say
i
was
a
thief
the
dapper
little
man
stood
before
the
empty
stove
picking
his
beautiful
white
teeth
with
his
metal
well
ash
business
is
business
and
no
man
likes
to
be
robbed
you
know
is
that
what
you
have
come
to
tell
me
because
if
so
you
can
impart
the
information
equally
well
while
i
am
pitching
you
through
the
window
the
little
man
did
not
seem
at
all
annoyed
he
did
not
even
seem
amused
he
appeared
to
be
quite
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
speech
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
at
any
rate
well
no
quite
the
other
way
fact
is
i
looking
for
a
wife
a
what
a
wife
the
deuce
you
are
and
do
you
think
i
a
selection
on
view
here
not
a
selection
you
got
one
what
the
dickens
do
you
mean
come
ash
you
know
it
your
ward
miss
truscott
ash
gave
a
loud
whistle
of
surprise
then
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
dapper
little
man
the
dapper
little
man
went
on
in
the
calmest
sort
of
way
the
fact
is
i
sick
of
chambers
and
i
sick
of
dining
at
the
club
i
want
a
house
and
i
do
care
to
take
a
house
unless
i
take
a
wife
why
should
it
be
miss
truscott
ash
he
paused
as
if
for
a
reply
but
if
he
did
none
came
there
another
thing
you
know
rosenbaum
ash
signified
assent
he
wants
to
plant
one
of
his
girls
on
me
all
six
of
them
so
far
as
i
can
see
he
always
shying
them
at
my
head
besides
he
been
hammered
twice
if
he
went
again
where
should
i
be
i
like
to
know
not
to
mention
that
the
whole
six
of
them
have
got
carbuncles
instead
of
noses
and
moustaches
quite
as
good
as
mine
i
did
hear
that
you
were
engaged
to
a
miss
rosenbaum
then
you
heard
wrong
i
ai
why
should
it
be
miss
truscott
ash
i
got
something
and
she
got
something
i
tell
you
fairly
if
she
had
it
would
do
and
if
we
pulled
together
you
and
i
we
might
put
something
in
each
other
way
he
winked
at
ash
ash
grinned
and
turned
aside
he
regarded
the
letter
on
his
desk
have
you
spoken
to
her
yet
not
a
word
i
wanted
first
to
have
things
clear
with
you
i
run
down
if
it
all
serene
ash
appeared
to
be
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
no
man
in
england
that
girl
need
ask
to
marry
her
i
sure
i
never
said
there
was
ah
i
daresay
if
you
were
to
take
nine
men
out
of
ten
and
heap
them
in
a
crowd
she
might
take
her
pick
out
of
the
lot
if
it
comes
to
that
i
might
take
my
pick
out
of
a
few
frederic
ely
a
man
who
never
need
go
begging
ash
smiled
his
smile
was
scarcely
flattering
to
his
friend
he
continued
to
turn
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
suddenly
he
got
up
ely
i
like
you
we
had
our
differences
but
as
you
say
because
we
both
men
of
business
and
like
to
see
the
entries
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
that
was
not
exactly
what
ely
had
said
but
no
matter
lily
truscott
a
girl
in
a
thousand
in
million
sir
i
know
her
i
know
her
well
there
nothing
in
that
girl
heart
which
is
hidden
from
me
and
that
girl
heart
all
good
and
that
something
to
say
of
a
girl
at
this
time
of
day
if
she
were
my
daughter
and
i
were
her
father
there
no
man
to
whom
i
should
be
more
willing
to
give
her
sir
than
you
take
her
sir
take
her
and
i
wish
you
joy
he
turned
away
but
whether
it
was
to
hide
a
tear
or
even
some
deeper
sign
of
heartfelt
emotion
is
a
difficult
thing
to
say
ely
did
not
appear
much
touched
that
the
time
of
day
old
man
you
send
her
along
a
line
to
say
on
the
road
prepare
her
mind
you
know
if
ash
did
not
know
at
least
ely
winked
i
be
up
in
time
if
you
write
to
her
now
she
get
it
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
she
have
time
to
settle
herself
before
i
come
ta
ta
see
you
in
the
house
ely
moved
towards
the
door
ash
spoke
to
him
just
as
he
reached
it
how
about
that
erie
syndicate
ely
paused
he
stared
steadily
at
ash
back
for
some
reason
ash
continued
with
his
back
turned
away
you
help
me
with
this
and
i
help
you
with
that
i
ca
say
fairer
than
that
my
boy
apparently
ash
did
not
seem
to
think
he
could
for
when
ely
was
gone
and
the
door
was
closed
he
indulged
in
a
little
quiet
laughter
he
reseated
himself
in
his
chair
and
began
to
nurse
his
knee
i
think
yes
i
think
that
will
do
ely
a
curious
combination
in
business
matters
one
of
the
shrewdest
men
i
know
out
of
them
one
of
the
greatest
idiots
on
earth
however
i
think
that
it
will
do
just
add
a
postscript
to
that
letter
of
mine
he
drew
the
letter
towards
him
and
to
the
end
of
it
tagged
the
following
by
the
way
a
friend
of
yours
frederic
ely
will
be
with
you
morning
perhaps
almost
as
soon
as
you
get
this
he
is
a
gentleman
for
whose
character
i
have
the
greatest
respect
he
will
ask
my
dear
lily
a
question
in
which
both
he
and
i
are
deeply
interested
i
earnestly
trust
that
my
dear
lily
heart
will
answer
he
scanned
the
with
admiring
eyes
i
call
that
neat
but
not
gaudy
none
of
the
awful
guardian
there
and
upon
my
word
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
him
one
as
good
as
another
and
if
he
chooses
he
can
be
as
good
as
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
me
folding
the
letter
he
placed
it
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
it
miss
truscott
the
cliff
shanklin
isle
of
wight
while
he
was
still
engaged
in
this
proceeding
the
clear
ringing
tones
of
a
voice
was
heard
in
the
outer
office
and
for
the
second
time
that
morning
the
door
of
ash
sanctum
was
unceremoniously
opened
and
again
unannounced
a
second
visitor
came
in
chapter
ii
the
second
wooer
a
very
different
visitor
this
to
the
first
a
tall
stalwart
fellow
with
a
guardsman
chest
a
long
fair
beard
which
hid
his
neck
and
a
huge
pair
of
the
most
ridiculous
moustaches
no
bandbox
fellow
he
dressed
in
a
shooting
suit
crowned
by
a
soft
hat
flourishing
what
was
a
bludgeon
rather
than
a
stick
in
his
hand
he
seemed
hardly
the
type
of
figure
which
is
generally
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
capel
court
hallo
ash
tracked
you
down
old
man
his
voice
was
like
himself
there
was
plenty
of
it
it
should
have
been
worth
a
fortune
to
him
on
the
stock
exchange
summers
whatever
brings
you
here
what
does
often
bring
a
man
to
the
city
love
and
my
eyes
what
ash
fairly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
he
stared
at
his
visitor
with
bewildered
surprise
you
may
well
stare
and
stare
your
fill
i
worth
staring
at
for
i
just
do
feel
as
though
i
know
whether
i
standing
on
my
head
or
heels
the
greatest
stroke
of
luck
has
happened
to
me
that
ever
happened
to
a
man
before
i
sold
my
picture
for
a
thousand
pounds
you
done
what
ah
i
knew
you
would
believe
it
it
does
sound
incredible
it
but
it
is
a
fact
though
all
the
same
i
sold
my
new
gallery
picture
dream
of
love
an
idyll
by
william
summers
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
have
you
come
all
the
way
to
draper
gardens
to
tell
me
so
very
good
of
you
i
sure
it
would
be
good
of
me
if
that
was
all
but
it
not
there
happens
to
be
more
what
does
that
sale
mean
it
means
that
i
made
a
hit
that
i
got
a
commission
for
another
at
the
same
price
that
my
fortune
is
made
i
a
man
of
fortune
sir
i
assure
you
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
but
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
mentioning
that
i
still
have
my
fortune
to
make
and
that
this
is
the
busiest
hour
of
the
day
all
right
wait
half
a
jiffy
man
keep
yourself
in
hand
for
upon
my
soul
i
ca
what
does
my
being
a
man
of
fortune
mean
it
means
that
i
have
become
a
marrying
man
a
man
who
has
a
right
to
marry
so
going
to
marry
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
do
i
know
the
lady
well
rather
considering
that
she
your
ward
what
miss
truscott
going
to
be
my
wife
i
thought
i
would
just
drop
in
and
let
you
know
drop
in
and
let
me
know
if
this
is
the
coolest
proceeding
i
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
the
amazed
ash
stared
at
his
visitor
who
seemed
so
to
speak
to
be
laughing
all
over
his
face
then
he
dropped
into
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
addressed
letter
which
lay
upon
his
desk
he
appeared
to
be
conscious
of
a
certain
confusion
of
mind
good
gad
he
told
himself
just
now
i
was
wishing
that
some
one
would
come
along
and
marry
her
this
is
a
case
of
one
wishes
being
too
plentifully
granted
it
strikes
me
there
one
too
many
then
he
addressed
himself
to
his
visitor
aloud
really
summers
i
fail
to
understand
you
it
plain
enough
it
may
be
plain
enough
to
you
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
it
is
anything
but
plain
enough
to
me
may
i
ask
when
you
made
what
i
must
call
this
surreptitious
request
to
my
ward
for
her
hand
oh
that
just
the
point
i
have
spoken
to
her
yet
you
have
spoken
to
her
yet
i
understood
you
to
say
that
she
was
going
to
marry
you
that
right
enough
so
she
is
this
may
be
plain
enough
to
you
but
it
is
really
getting
still
less
plain
to
me
you
evidently
think
that
her
guardian
consent
is
not
required
may
i
ask
if
you
think
that
the
lady
is
unnecessary
too
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
i
see
that
plainly
ash
do
you
know
that
there
is
a
language
more
eloquent
than
speech
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
and
woman
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
and
yet
not
interchange
a
word
we
understand
each
other
like
that
my
friend
i
should
be
sorry
to
say
anything
which
might
lessen
your
but
i
think
you
are
mistaken
mr
summers
oh
no
i
not
but
i
say
you
are
hang
it
sir
i
never
saw
a
more
saw
and
conquered
style
about
a
man
before
if
i
were
you
i
would
wait
for
victory
to
forward
your
despatch
as
it
is
i
happen
to
know
that
miss
truscott
is
engaged
already
so
saying
ash
slipped
his
letter
into
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
what
for
goodness
sake
summers
do
shout
the
ceiling
down
you
will
have
the
people
coming
in
from
the
street
not
to
speak
of
the
clerks
outside
if
i
did
know
that
you
meant
it
for
a
jest
i
should
say
it
was
a
lie
you
may
say
exactly
what
you
please
it
wo
alter
the
fact
the
fact
you
call
that
a
fact
i
go
down
to
shanklin
by
the
next
train
and
learn
the
truth
from
her
own
lips
summers
made
for
the
door
but
ash
interposed
he
was
conscious
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
induce
this
impetuous
suitor
to
hasten
slowly
one
moment
summers
i
am
sure
you
would
be
unwilling
to
do
another
an
injury
even
unconsciously
if
you
will
restrain
your
impatience
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
exactly
how
the
matter
lies
how
the
matter
lies
that
just
what
it
does
do
it
lies
or
some
one
does
at
any
rate
summers
you
are
a
man
of
honour
we
are
both
men
of
honour
i
trust
would
you
have
me
break
my
plighted
word
break
your
plighted
word
that
depends
if
you
plighted
your
word
to
break
my
heart
by
george
i
have
you
break
it
then
let
me
remove
this
matter
from
the
realms
of
romance
into
the
regions
of
common
sense
when
you
city
men
begin
to
talk
about
common
sense
you
mean
something
very
common
indeed
summers
this
is
a
very
solemn
subject
to
me
solemn
subject
to
you
i
wonder
what
sort
of
subject
you
think
it
is
to
me
is
she
going
to
be
my
wife
or
yours
miss
truscott
will
be
the
wife
of
neither
wo
she
by
george
we
see
again
summers
made
for
the
door
again
ash
made
haste
to
interpose
if
you
will
permit
me
to
speak
half
a
dozen
consecutive
words
without
interruption
i
will
make
it
plain
to
you
that
what
i
have
at
heart
is
the
interest
of
all
concerned
except
me
never
mind
i
listen
out
with
your
half
a
dozen
words
summers
dropped
into
a
chair
in
a
way
which
must
have
been
a
severe
test
of
its
solidity
and
brought
his
bludgeon
down
upon
the
floor
with
a
bang
ash
started
he
felt
that
this
was
a
sort
of
suitor
he
had
not
bargained
for
the
case
in
a
nutshell
is
simply
this
just
before
you
came
there
was
a
gentleman
here
who
made
exactly
the
same
proposal
you
have
done
he
too
solicited
the
honour
of
miss
truscott
hand
summers
was
up
like
a
rocket
again
his
bludgeon
came
down
with
a
bang
the
devil
there
was
confound
his
impudence
what
was
the
name
the
scoundrel
name
is
immaterial
the
point
is
that
i
agreed
that
he
should
go
down
to
shanklin
and
in
proper
form
make
to
the
lady
the
offer
of
his
hand
did
you
then
i
am
off
tonight
still
one
moment
summers
if
you
please
you
appeared
to
be
so
certain
of
the
lady
affection
that
i
was
scarcely
prepared
to
find
you
so
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
a
rival
in
the
field
alarmed
not
i
i
will
back
my
darling
truth
against
the
world
then
supposing
instead
of
confining
yourself
to
words
you
prove
your
faith
by
deeds
let
this
man
try
his
luck
if
he
fails
there
is
the
next
day
left
for
you
look
here
ash
when
he
failed
will
you
consent
to
lily
being
mine
if
he
fails
and
miss
truscott
gives
her
consent
then
i
will
then
it
agreed
the
beggar
shall
have
his
chance
the
day
after
i
try
mine
just
then
the
door
opened
and
ely
appeared
summers
rushed
to
him
with
outstretched
hand
hallo
ely
have
seen
you
for
an
age
you
looking
queer
you
ought
to
try
a
change
of
air
think
so
i
going
out
of
town
are
you
that
odd
the
day
after
i
going
too
these
remarks
were
exchanged
while
the
two
gentlemen
shook
hands
chapter
iii
ely
arrives
miss
truscott
was
evidently
not
in
the
pleasantest
frame
of
mind
it
was
unfortunate
for
she
was
the
kind
of
maid
one
feels
instinctively
ought
always
to
be
in
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
tall
slender
with
great
big
eyes
sunny
hair
and
the
sweetest
smile
the
latter
however
was
conspicuous
by
its
absence
as
she
sat
at
the
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
she
was
at
breakfast
with
her
aunt
clive
was
a
precise
old
lady
who
always
indoors
wore
lace
cuffs
and
collar
and
the
neatest
of
caps
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
hers
that
she
was
never
known
to
be
anything
but
cool
and
sometimes
her
niece
was
neither
then
it
increased
the
young
lady
sense
of
aggravation
to
observe
how
her
aunt
demeanour
contrasted
with
her
own
as
for
instance
it
did
now
you
do
seem
to
be
in
the
least
surprised
or
annoyed
or
hurt
you
quite
take
it
for
granted
that
i
should
be
insulted
clive
considered
for
a
moment
before
she
answered
she
sat
bolt
upright
her
hands
in
her
lap
the
model
of
decorum
my
dear
lily
the
younger
generation
is
impetuous
miss
truscott
sighed
to
be
called
impetuous
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
seemed
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
i
write
to
my
guardian
on
the
whole
four
sides
of
a
sheet
of
paper
to
tell
him
that
i
must
get
away
from
this
dreadful
place
or
i
shall
die
and
this
is
the
answer
he
sends
she
spread
the
letter
out
before
her
on
the
table
and
read
it
aloud
with
comments
by
the
way
dear
lily
yes
dear
at
any
price
i
know
have
read
your
charming
letter
with
the
greatest
interest
did
anybody
ever
hear
the
like
of
that
he
read
my
charming
letter
with
the
greatest
interest
when
i
wrote
to
tell
him
that
i
quite
believed
that
i
should
die
are
indeed
a
mistress
of
the
epistolary
art
that
is
a
pretty
compliment
to
pay
when
you
write
and
tell
a
person
that
life
is
not
worth
living
account
which
you
give
of
the
doings
of
your
neighbours
is
most
entertaining
now
i
never
mentioned
a
single
word
about
anything
but
the
state
of
my
mind
is
with
the
greatest
pleasure
that
i
hear
of
your
continuance
in
good
health
when
the
whole
letter
was
written
to
tell
him
that
i
was
nearly
dead
am
glad
to
hear
too
that
your
aunt
clive
is
still
in
the
enjoyment
of
nature
greatest
blessing
what
nature
greatest
blessing
is
i
do
know
but
i
am
sure
i
never
even
breathed
your
name
convey
to
her
my
compliments
with
pleasure
aunt
envy
you
your
sojourn
amidst
summer
scenic
splendours
that
is
what
he
says
and
i
actually
told
him
that
i
was
convinced
that
if
i
stayed
any
longer
amidst
what
he
calls
scenic
splendours
i
should
just
go
raving
mad
as
i
am
to
the
juggernaut
of
commerce
i
can
however
but
look
and
long
now
did
you
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
that
and
yet
you
say
the
younger
generation
is
impetuous
i
should
just
like
to
have
my
affectionate
guardian
here
i
let
him
know
what
the
juggernaut
really
was
the
young
lady
seemed
a
little
excited
but
the
elder
one
was
still
quite
calm
you
have
forgotten
the
postscript
my
dear
forgotten
the
postscript
oh
aunty
do
i
wish
i
could
by
the
way
a
friend
of
yours
frederic
ely
will
be
with
you
morning
perhaps
almost
as
soon
as
you
get
this
perhaps
the
wretch
is
actually
on
the
doorstep
now
lily
lily
how
can
you
talk
like
that
so
he
is
a
wretch
but
never
mind
it
all
the
same
to
me
is
a
gentleman
for
whose
character
i
have
the
greatest
respect
he
will
ask
my
dear
lily
a
question
in
which
both
he
and
i
are
deeply
interested
i
earnestly
trust
that
my
dear
lily
heart
will
answer
yes
talk
about
a
woman
postscript
ash
puts
nothing
in
his
letter
and
the
whole
library
of
the
british
museum
in
his
well
aunty
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
on
the
near
approach
of
your
settlement
in
life
miss
truscott
gave
a
little
shriek
and
then
was
dumb
she
glared
at
her
aunt
as
though
she
could
believe
neither
her
eyes
or
ears
clive
went
placidly
on
it
is
indeed
gratifying
to
learn
that
ash
has
made
his
choice
who
has
made
his
choice
asked
miss
truscott
between
her
little
teeth
one
for
whose
character
he
has
the
greatest
respect
such
words
coming
from
ash
are
satisfactory
in
the
extreme
you
are
indeed
fortunate
in
possessing
a
guardian
who
has
your
interests
so
entirely
at
heart
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
miss
truscott
do
you
think
i
shall
marry
this
man
lily
exclaimed
give
you
have
such
a
singular
way
of
expressing
yourself
but
perhaps
the
old
lady
smoothed
her
gown
perhaps
you
are
a
little
surprised
miss
truscott
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
i
am
she
said
i
am
a
little
surprised
i
suppose
we
are
all
when
our
turns
come
i
remember
in
my
young
days
when
my
dear
mother
told
me
that
i
was
to
marry
mr
clive
told
you
you
were
to
marry
mr
clive
yes
my
dear
and
i
remember
quite
well
how
bewildered
i
was
at
first
did
you
love
him
then
my
dear
how
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
we
were
comparative
strangers
i
had
only
been
acquainted
with
him
about
three
months
three
months
good
gracious
why
i
thought
three
minutes
was
long
enough
to
fall
in
love
lily
i
am
amazed
to
hear
you
talk
so
flippantly
it
is
plain
that
it
is
quite
time
that
you
had
more
settled
views
of
life
among
the
new
responsibilities
on
which
you
are
now
about
to
enter
i
trust
that
you
will
learn
the
solemnity
of
woman
position
in
the
world
and
the
deference
which
she
owes
to
the
married
state
miss
truscott
laughed
her
laughter
was
of
rather
an
hysterical
kind
as
though
it
were
near
akin
to
tears
but
clive
was
shocked
she
regarded
miss
truscott
with
what
she
intended
to
be
considered
as
severe
disapprobation
then
with
her
most
stately
air
she
rose
and
left
the
room
pausing
at
the
door
however
she
delivered
herself
of
a
final
expression
of
her
opinion
lily
i
am
disappointed
in
you
i
can
only
hope
that
ely
will
not
have
cause
to
be
disappointed
too
when
miss
truscott
was
left
alone
she
sat
quite
still
looking
into
vacancy
the
smile
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
was
hardly
up
to
its
usual
character
for
sweetness
there
was
a
glitter
in
her
eyes
which
gave
them
quite
a
new
expression
suddenly
she
leaned
her
face
upon
her
hands
and
shivered
it
could
hardly
have
been
with
cold
for
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
day
was
warm
then
she
got
up
and
began
pacing
restlessly
about
the
room
is
it
a
dream
is
it
a
dream
her
hands
were
clasped
with
a
sort
of
hysteric
energy
what
does
it
matter
he
has
forgotten
me
what
fools
we
women
are
she
took
out
a
locket
which
was
hidden
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
gazed
upon
the
face
which
it
contained
willy
how
softly
she
breathed
the
name
twelve
months
since
you
told
me
that
story
with
your
eyes
twelve
months
ago
where
have
you
been
this
weary
time
i
suppose
it
was
an
incident
with
you
i
have
heard
those
sort
of
things
are
incidents
with
men
what
a
fool
i
was
to
take
it
seriously
what
fools
we
women
are
i
ought
to
have
known
that
it
was
the
fashion
with
summers
to
love
and
ride
away
she
stood
gazing
at
the
portrait
all
at
once
something
angered
her
some
recollection
perhaps
of
long
ago
she
snapped
the
slender
chain
to
which
it
was
attached
and
flung
the
locket
on
the
floor
as
if
not
content
with
this
degradation
of
her
treasure
she
placed
her
little
foot
upon
it
and
crushed
it
beneath
her
heel
what
fools
we
women
are
for
a
moment
she
looked
upon
the
ruins
she
had
wrought
the
pretty
little
locket
was
crushed
all
out
of
shape
then
came
penitence
and
stooping
down
with
streaming
eyes
she
picked
the
broken
locket
up
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
and
still
upon
her
knees
flinging
herself
face
downwards
on
to
the
seat
of
a
great
she
cried
as
though
her
heart
would
break
i
did
mean
to
do
it
willy
i
did
mean
to
do
it
but
it
all
the
same
it
does
matter
whom
i
marry
now
she
was
only
a
girl
and
it
is
a
charming
characteristic
of
the
better
sort
of
girls
that
they
will
do
foolish
things
at
times
but
there
was
very
little
of
the
girl
about
her
when
ely
came
she
was
the
stateliest
of
young
ladies
then
the
air
of
having
just
come
out
of
a
bandbox
was
more
apparent
about
ely
in
the
country
even
than
in
town
he
was
one
of
those
very
few
men
who
are
never
seen
out
of
a
throgmorton
street
or
a
devonshire
lane
it
was
the
same
to
him
wherever
he
was
his
attire
remained
unaltered
but
it
must
be
allowed
that
he
was
conscious
that
things
were
not
compatible
patent
shoes
and
a
devonshire
lane
so
from
the
devonshire
lane
he
religiously
stayed
away
he
did
his
ruralising
in
centres
of
fashion
where
his
was
in
place
and
not
in
the
equivalents
of
the
devonshire
lane
he
was
not
affected
by
the
modern
craze
for
the
country
side
he
objected
to
it
strongly
a
fact
which
he
made
plain
as
soon
as
he
appeared
on
the
scene
clive
received
him
she
began
the
conversation
on
what
she
fondly
conceived
were
the
usual
lines
how
glad
you
must
be
to
get
into
the
country
it
must
be
such
a
change
from
town
change
i
should
think
it
is
a
change
beastly
change
by
george
clive
was
a
little
shocked
the
adverb
did
not
fall
sweetly
on
her
ear
but
ely
went
glibly
on
he
had
a
grievance
which
he
wished
to
air
why
they
do
have
decent
cabs
at
the
station
i
do
know
if
there
was
a
live
man
in
the
place
he
put
some
hansoms
on
the
road
fly
they
called
the
thing
i
came
up
in
fly
i
should
like
to
know
the
aboriginal
definition
of
crawl
and
dusty
i
left
my
mark
upon
that
seat
and
that
seat
left
its
mark
on
me
i
feel
like
a
regular
dustman
upon
my
word
i
do
miss
truscott
made
her
first
appearance
at
the
the
meal
was
not
an
entire
success
this
was
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
miss
trustcott
seemed
to
have
gone
back
into
the
glacial
or
prehistoric
period
and
partly
because
ely
still
had
his
grievance
on
his
mind
clive
did
her
best
to
entertain
the
company
but
in
spite
of
her
meritorious
efforts
the
conversation
languished
and
how
are
things
in
the
city
she
felt
that
this
was
the
sort
of
question
she
ought
to
ask
all
over
the
shop
clive
started
she
felt
that
the
answer
was
not
so
explanatory
as
it
might
have
been
still
she
bravely
persevered
dear
me
i
suppose
that
commercial
matters
are
affected
by
the
seasons
she
thought
that
this
sort
of
remark
would
go
home
to
the
commercial
mind
eh
oh
yes
rather
i
should
think
they
were
in
fine
weather
traffics
go
up
all
round
noras
have
gone
up
one
doras
one
trunks
are
flat
there
a
there
and
rates
are
pooled
but
this
side
bulls
are
in
the
right
hole
pretty
near
all
along
the
line
bertha
about
the
only
one
got
stuck
clive
was
speechless
she
looked
at
miss
truscott
with
imploring
eyes
but
that
young
lady
was
tranquilly
engaged
with
the
contents
of
her
plate
poor
girl
it
was
a
study
to
see
ely
face
when
the
old
lady
made
this
innocent
remark
i
beg
your
pardon
what
did
you
say
i
said
poor
girl
i
hope
she
has
done
nothing
wrong
who
done
nothing
wrong
the
young
lady
you
mentioned
miss
bertha
i
think
you
said
i
am
not
acquainted
with
her
surname
ely
was
silent
he
was
not
a
man
gifted
with
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
was
not
at
all
clear
in
his
own
mind
that
the
old
lady
was
not
amusing
herself
at
his
expense
clive
conscious
that
something
was
wrong
went
painfully
plodding
on
i
trust
ely
that
i
have
not
unintentionally
said
something
to
hurt
your
feelings
is
the
young
lady
a
friend
of
yours
what
young
lady
ely
placed
his
knife
and
fork
together
with
a
little
clatter
on
his
plate
was
she
at
it
again
this
was
more
than
a
man
could
stand
miss
bertha
the
young
lady
you
mentioned
bertha
not
a
lady
not
a
lady
dear
me
one
of
the
lower
classes
i
perceive
now
i
understand
ah
i
afraid
that
from
them
anything
may
be
expected
nowadays
ely
turned
pink
not
with
suppressed
mirth
but
with
what
was
very
much
like
rage
for
some
moments
an
unprejudiced
spectator
might
have
debated
in
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
he
was
not
about
to
be
profane
but
if
it
were
so
he
conquered
his
impious
tendency
and
adopted
another
line
of
conduct
instead
he
rose
from
his
seat
if
you
will
allow
me
i
go
outside
for
a
change
of
air
and
without
waiting
for
the
required
permission
he
marched
through
the
french
window
out
on
to
the
lawn
the
old
lady
turned
to
her
niece
my
dear
lily
what
have
i
said
or
done
my
dear
aunt
i
believe
that
bertha
in
the
slang
of
the
stock
exchange
signifies
the
london
brighton
and
south
coast
railway
i
suspect
that
ely
imagines
that
you
have
been
amusing
yourself
at
his
expense
clive
was
aghast
go
to
him
lily
do
leave
him
alone
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
might
return
at
once
to
town
miss
truscott
rose
with
her
most
tranquil
air
we
might
survive
his
departure
if
he
did
but
her
aunt
was
shocked
lily
it
pains
me
to
hear
such
language
from
your
lips
you
are
now
approaching
one
of
the
most
solemn
moments
of
your
life
rise
to
the
occasion
child
and
show
that
although
still
a
child
in
years
you
have
within
you
the
wherewithal
with
which
to
make
a
woman
in
good
time
miss
truscott
looked
as
if
she
could
have
said
something
if
she
would
but
she
refrained
she
left
the
room
without
a
word
chapter
iv
ely
wooes
the
interview
between
ely
and
the
object
of
his
heart
devotion
was
not
so
solemn
as
it
might
have
been
possibly
that
was
in
a
measure
owing
to
what
had
gone
before
but
it
must
be
owned
that
miss
truscott
mood
was
hardly
attuned
to
the
occasion
we
must
also
at
the
same
time
allow
that
ely
demeanour
was
hardly
that
of
the
ideal
wooer
your
aunt
seems
to
have
a
nice
idea
of
business
i
heard
a
few
things
but
she
beats
all
i
thought
she
was
getting
at
me
upon
my
word
i
did
this
was
scarcely
the
remark
with
which
to
open
a
tender
interview
miss
truscott
said
nothing
she
was
seated
in
a
low
hatless
her
little
feet
peeping
from
under
the
hem
of
her
summer
gown
she
seemed
sufficiently
cool
just
then
but
her
silence
did
not
appear
to
be
altogether
to
ely
liking
he
himself
did
not
seem
to
be
as
cool
as
he
might
have
been
i
believe
miss
truscott
that
ash
has
told
you
what
brought
me
here
ely
tone
seemed
even
waspish
not
loverlike
at
all
indeed
miss
truscott
just
parted
her
lips
and
let
the
word
drop
out
that
was
all
may
i
ask
what
i
am
to
understand
by
that
just
then
a
fat
white
dog
of
the
doormat
species
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
steps
miss
truscott
addressed
this
animal
pompey
pompey
good
dog
come
here
the
good
dog
referred
to
slowly
waddled
across
the
grass
and
on
reaching
miss
truscott
chair
was
raised
to
the
seat
of
honour
upon
that
lady
knee
are
you
interested
in
dogs
ely
if
so
i
am
sure
you
must
like
pompey
he
generally
bites
strangers
at
first
but
perhaps
after
a
time
he
wo
bite
you
i
take
care
he
does
get
a
chance
either
first
or
last
why
not
he
bit
a
piece
of
cloth
out
of
the
curate
trousers
the
other
day
but
staines
says
that
he
does
think
his
teeth
quite
met
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
ely
gasped
his
temperature
seemed
rapidly
to
increase
i
did
not
come
here
to
talk
about
dogs
and
you
excuse
my
mentioning
that
you
have
not
yet
informed
me
as
to
whether
ash
has
told
you
what
i
did
come
for
let
me
see
miss
truscott
took
out
her
guardian
letter
and
referred
to
it
before
ely
distended
eyes
hum
hum
pompey
lie
down
there
now
pompey
has
torn
it
all
to
bits
as
indeed
the
animal
had
and
was
now
chewing
some
of
the
fragments
as
though
they
were
a
sort
of
supplementary
meal
what
shall
i
do
pompey
has
the
most
extraordinary
taste
it
runs
in
the
family
i
think
do
you
know
that
his
mother
once
ate
nearly
the
whole
of
a
pair
of
my
old
shoes
ely
wiped
his
brow
he
was
becoming
very
warm
indeed
he
seated
himself
in
another
garden
chair
for
a
moment
he
contemplated
drawing
it
closer
to
miss
truscott
side
but
the
thought
of
pompey
and
his
extraordinary
taste
which
ran
in
his
family
induced
him
to
refrain
miss
truscott
i
a
business
man
and
i
like
to
do
things
in
a
business
kind
of
way
ely
paused
he
felt
that
he
was
feeling
his
way
but
the
young
lady
disarranged
his
plans
by
the
way
ely
have
you
been
up
regent
street
just
lately
been
up
regent
street
can
you
tell
me
if
there
are
any
nice
things
in
the
ely
did
not
exactly
gasp
this
time
he
choked
down
something
in
his
throat
what
it
was
we
can
not
say
miss
truscott
i
a
business
man
you
said
that
before
the
words
were
murmured
as
miss
truscott
stroked
pompey
woolly
head
said
it
before
i
say
it
again
i
wish
you
allow
me
to
get
right
through
right
through
what
right
through
what
right
through
what
i
have
to
say
oh
go
on
pray
i
hope
i
have
interrupted
you
interrupted
me
ely
snorted
no
other
word
will
describe
the
sound
he
made
i
say
i
a
business
man
third
time
of
asking
ely
got
up
he
looked
very
cross
indeed
pompey
snarled
that
faithful
animal
seemed
to
scent
battle
in
the
air
well
i
hanged
we
fear
that
ely
would
have
preferred
another
termination
but
he
contented
himself
with
hanged
miss
truscott
looked
up
she
allowed
her
long
sweeping
eyelashes
gradually
to
unveil
her
eyes
she
regarded
ely
with
a
look
of
the
sweetest
most
innocent
surprise
ely
whatever
is
there
wrong
ely
was
obliged
to
take
a
step
or
two
before
he
could
trust
himself
to
speak
as
he
was
sufficiently
warm
already
the
exercise
did
not
tend
to
make
him
cool
under
the
circumstances
he
showed
a
considerable
amount
of
courage
in
coming
to
the
point
with
a
rush
miss
truscott
i
want
a
wife
you
want
a
what
a
wife
do
i
say
it
plain
enough
i
want
a
wife
i
see
you
want
a
wife
with
her
calmest
coolest
air
miss
truscott
continued
stroking
pompey
head
did
you
notice
how
they
are
wearing
the
hats
in
town
ely
sprang
literally
sprang
about
an
inch
and
a
half
from
the
ground
what
the
dickens
do
i
know
about
the
hats
in
town
ely
how
excited
you
do
get
i
thought
everybody
knew
about
the
hats
in
town
i
mean
whether
they
wear
them
on
the
right
side
or
the
left
ely
was
not
an
excitable
man
as
a
rule
but
he
certainly
did
seem
excited
now
his
handkerchief
which
he
had
kept
in
his
hand
since
the
commencement
of
the
interview
he
had
kneaded
into
a
little
ball
which
was
hard
as
stone
miss
truscott
i
i
give
a
sovereign
to
any
charity
you
like
to
name
if
you
stick
to
the
point
for
just
two
minutes
hand
over
the
sovereign
ely
was
taken
aback
miss
truscott
held
out
her
small
white
hand
with
a
promptitude
which
surprised
him
i
i
said
that
i
would
give
a
sovereign
to
any
charity
you
like
to
name
if
you
stick
to
the
point
for
just
two
minutes
cash
in
advance
and
i
keep
to
any
point
you
like
to
name
for
ten
ely
was
doubtful
miss
truscott
looked
at
him
with
eyes
which
were
wide
enough
open
now
her
hand
was
unflinchingly
held
out
ely
felt
in
the
recesses
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
produced
a
sovereign
purse
and
from
this
sovereign
purse
he
produced
a
coin
it
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
of
a
man
having
to
pay
a
sovereign
to
ask
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
hand
over
the
sovereign
she
became
possessed
of
the
golden
coin
this
sovereign
will
be
applied
to
the
charitable
purpose
of
erecting
a
monument
over
pompey
mother
grave
now
ely
i
your
man
ely
seemed
a
little
subdued
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
taken
at
his
word
perhaps
caused
him
to
feel
a
certain
respect
for
the
lady
character
he
reseated
himself
in
the
i
already
said
that
i
want
a
wife
do
you
wish
me
to
find
you
one
i
can
introduce
you
to
several
of
my
friends
i
know
a
young
lady
in
the
village
aged
about
who
has
an
impediment
in
her
speech
who
would
make
an
excellent
companion
for
your
more
silent
hours
the
wife
i
want
is
you
that
is
very
good
of
you
i
sure
there
was
a
pause
the
lady
with
a
little
smile
tranquilly
tickled
pompey
with
the
sovereign
she
had
earned
the
gentleman
fidgeted
with
his
handkerchief
well
miss
truscott
am
i
to
be
gratified
why
do
you
want
me
wo
some
one
else
do
as
well
immediately
the
gentleman
became
a
little
rose
may
i
ask
you
for
an
answer
to
my
question
you
have
asked
me
a
question
yet
will
you
be
my
wife
the
question
was
put
in
a
rather
louder
key
than
in
such
cases
is
understood
to
be
the
rule
miss
truscott
raised
her
head
and
for
some
moments
kept
her
glance
fixed
upon
the
gentleman
as
though
she
were
trying
to
read
something
in
his
face
then
she
lowered
her
glance
and
made
answer
thus
frankly
you
say
you
are
a
business
man
let
us
as
you
suggest
understand
each
other
in
a
business
kind
of
way
in
asking
me
to
be
your
wife
you
are
not
asking
for
love
as
she
spoke
of
love
her
lips
gave
just
the
tiniest
twitch
i
believe
that
a
wife
is
supposed
to
love
her
husband
as
a
rule
in
your
creed
love
comes
after
marriage
at
this
present
moment
i
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
that
exactly
what
i
understand
you
not
even
making
a
pretence
of
loving
me
miss
truscott
as
you
put
it
i
a
business
man
i
have
money
you
have
money
let
put
the
lot
together
and
make
a
pile
really
that
not
a
bad
idea
on
the
whole
it
was
the
young
lady
who
gave
this
rather
unexpected
conclusion
to
his
sentence
then
she
looked
at
him
steadily
with
those
great
eyes
of
hers
whose
meaning
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
understand
i
suppose
that
all
you
want
from
me
is
and
that
in
complete
indifference
as
to
whether
i
like
you
or
do
not
if
you
did
like
me
you
would
be
sitting
here
really
that
not
a
bad
idea
again
you
arrive
at
rapid
conclusions
in
your
own
peculiar
way
i
suppose
if
i
told
you
that
i
could
like
a
man
love
him
better
than
my
life
you
would
not
understand
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
my
line
i
not
a
sentimental
kind
of
man
i
say
a
thing
and
mean
a
thing
and
when
i
say
i
do
a
thing
just
as
good
as
done
then
all
you
want
me
to
be
is
mrs
ely
what
else
do
you
suppose
i
want
you
to
be
it
amazing
how
even
the
most
sensible
women
like
to
beat
about
the
bush
here
have
i
asked
you
a
good
five
minutes
to
be
my
wife
and
you
just
coming
to
the
point
why
ca
you
say
right
out
yes
or
no
miss
truscott
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
suppose
it
does
matter
what
does
matter
what
i
say
by
george
though
but
it
does
miss
truscott
leaned
her
head
back
in
her
chair
she
put
her
hand
before
her
mouth
as
if
to
hide
a
yawn
she
closed
her
eyes
she
looked
more
than
half
asleep
then
i
will
will
what
say
you
mean
that
you
will
be
my
wife
it
a
bargain
mind
it
is
a
bargain
that
just
the
proper
word
to
use
that
all
right
then
i
send
a
wire
to
ash
to
let
him
know
done
yes
send
a
wire
up
to
town
to
let
him
know
it
done
ely
moved
towards
the
house
from
her
voice
and
manner
miss
truscott
still
seemed
more
than
half
asleep
but
hers
was
a
curious
kind
of
sleepiness
for
in
the
corner
of
each
of
her
closed
eyelids
there
gleamed
something
that
looked
very
like
a
drop
of
diamond
dew
prosaic
people
might
have
said
it
was
a
tear
chapter
v
ely
departs
ely
returned
to
town
on
the
following
morning
and
miss
truscott
was
an
engaged
young
woman
the
interval
between
the
moment
of
her
becoming
engaged
and
the
departure
of
the
gentleman
was
not
we
are
rather
at
a
loss
for
the
proper
word
to
use
let
us
put
it
was
not
exactly
so
pleasant
as
it
might
have
been
although
the
man
and
the
maid
had
plighted
troth
they
certainly
did
not
seem
like
lovers
they
scarcely
even
seemed
to
be
friends
the
position
seemed
to
be
a
little
strained
ely
noticed
this
as
the
day
wore
on
he
resented
it
in
the
garden
after
dinner
he
relieved
his
mind
the
lady
was
seated
the
admirable
pompey
on
her
knee
so
engaged
in
reading
as
to
appear
wholly
oblivious
that
the
gentleman
was
in
her
neighbourhood
for
some
time
ely
fidgeted
about
in
silence
the
lady
did
not
appear
even
to
notice
that
at
last
he
could
keep
still
no
longer
you
seem
very
fond
of
reading
i
am
the
lady
did
not
even
take
her
eyes
off
her
book
to
answer
him
but
read
tranquilly
on
i
hope
i
not
in
your
way
not
at
all
which
was
true
enough
he
might
have
been
miles
away
for
all
the
notice
the
lady
appeared
to
take
of
him
one

come
into
the
country

manners
one
has
to
come
into
the
country
to
do
what
as
if
conscious
that
he
was
skating
on
thin
ice
ely
endeavoured
to
retrace
his
steps
considering
that
only
this
morning
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
i
think
that
you
might
have
something
to
say
partially
closing
the
book
but
keeping
one
slender
finger
within
it
to
mark
the
place
the
lady
condescended
to
look
up
why
should
you
think
that
i
believe
it
is
usual
for
persons
in
our
situation
to
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
but
i
do
know
i
sure
the
lady
entirely
closed
her
book
and
placed
it
on
a
little
table
at
her
side
what
shall
we
talk
about
the
gentleman
was
still
under
such
circumstances
the
most
gifted
persons
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
commence
a
conversation
are
you
interested
in
questions
of
millinery
in
questions
of
millinery
or
do
you
take
a
wider
range
and
take
a
living
interest
in
the
burning
questions
of
the
progress
of
revolution
and
the
advance
of
man
ely
felt
clear
in
his
own
mind
that
the
lady
was
chaffing
him
but
he
did
not
quite
see
his
way
to
tell
her
so
i
fond
of
common
sense
ah
but
common
sense
is
a
term
which
conveys
such
different
meanings
i
suppose
that
in
its
strictest
definition
common
sense
is
the
highest
rarest
sense
of
all
i
suppose
that
you
use
the
term
in
a
different
way
this
was
exasperating
ely
felt
it
was
i
suppose
you
mean
that
i
a
fool
there
again
who
shall
define
folly
the
noblest
spirits
of
them
all
have
been
by
the
world
called
fools
miss
truscott
gazed
before
her
with
a
rapt
intensity
of
vision
as
though
she
saw
the
noble
spirits
referred
to
standing
in
the
glow
of
the
western
sky
i
must
say
you
have
nice
ideas
of
sociability
i
have
had
my
ideas
at
times
i
have
dreamed
of
a
social
intercourse
which
should
be
perfect
sympathy
but
they
were
but
dreams
ely
held
his
peace
this
sort
of
thing
was
not
at
all
his
idea
of
conversation
it
is
within
the
range
of
possibility
to
suspect
that
his
idea
of
perfect
conversation
was
perfect
shop
an
eternal
reiteration
of
the
and
of
stocks
and
shares
however
that
might
be
it
came
to
pass
that
neither
of
these
two
people
went
in
a
loverlike
frame
of
mind
to
bed
but
this
acted
upon
each
of
them
in
different
ways
for
instance
it
was
hours
after
miss
truscott
had
retired
to
her
chamber
before
the
young
lady
placed
herself
between
the
sheets
for
a
long
time
she
sat
before
the
open
window
looking
out
upon
the
sky
then
she
began
restlessly
pacing
to
and
fro
all
her
tranquillity
seemed
gone
i
have
been
and
a
fool
and
again
there
was
that
hysteric
interlacing
of
her
hands
which
seemed
to
be
a
familiar
trick
of
hers
when
her
mind
was
much
disturbed
i
have
made
the
greatest
mistake
of
all
i
have
promised
myself
to
a
man
i
loathe
she
shuddered
when
she
arrived
at
that
emphatic
word
a
man
with
whom
i
have
not
one
single
thing
in
common
a
man
who
understands
a
woman
as
much
as
less
than
pompey
does
i
believe
that
selfish
pompey
cares
for
me
much
more
a
man
whose
whole
soul
is
bound
up
in
playing
conjuring
tricks
with
stocks
and
shares
and
where
are
all
my
dreams
of
love
oh
they
have
flown
away
then
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
cried
oh
willy
willy
why
have
you
been
false
if
you
had
been
only
true
i
believe
that
i
am
so
weak
a
thing
that
if
you
should
call
to
me
i
would
come
after
she
had
had
enough
of
crying
which
was
only
after
a
very
considerable
period
had
elapsed
she
got
up
and
dried
her
eyes
those
big
eyes
of
hers
whose
meaning
for
the
life
of
him
ely
could
not
understand
what
does
it
matter
i
suppose
that
existence
is
a
dead
level
of
monotony
if
even
for
a
moment
you
gain
the
heights
you
are
sure
to
fall
and
your
state
is
all
the
worse
because
you
have
seen
that
there
are
better
things
above
this
was
the
lady
point
of
view
the
gentleman
was
of
quite
another
kind
as
he
had
said
sentiment
was
not
at
all
his
line
when
he
reached
his
room
he
wasted
no
time
getting
into
bed
while
he
performed
his
rapid
toilet
he
considered
the
situation
in
his
own
peculiar
way
that
the
most
impudent
girl
i
ever
met
this
he
told
himself
as
he
took
off
his
coat
i
like
her
all
the
better
for
it
too
here
he
removed
his
vest
she
does
care
for
me
a
snap
not
one
single
rap
i
hate
your
spoony
kind
of
girl
the
sort
that
goes
pawing
a
man
about
if
she
begins
by
pawing
you
she
be
pawing
another
fellow
soon
oh
seen
a
bit
of
it
i
have
here
he
removed
his
collar
and
tie
what
i
want
a
woman
who
can
cut
a
dash
not
the
sort
all
flounces
and
fluster
but
a
dash
you
know
the
sort
of
woman
that
can
make
all
the
other
women
want
to
have
her
life
who
can
sit
with
two
hundred
other
women
in
a
room
and
make
all
feel
that
she
does
know
that
there
another
person
there
by
jove
she
do
it
too
ely
laughed
but
perhaps
as
he
was
a
sort
of
man
who
never
laughed
in
whom
the
bump
of
humour
was
entirely
wanting
it
would
be
more
correct
to
describe
the
sound
he
made
as
a
clearing
of
the
throat
at
this
point
he
was
engaged
in
details
of
the
toilet
into
which
it
would
be
unwise
to
enter
but
we
really
can
not
refrain
from
mentioning
what
a
very
little
man
he
looked
in
his
shirt
quite
different
to
the
ely
of
the
white
waistcoat
and
frockcoat
the
next
morning
he
took
his
departure
he
had
been
under
the
painful
necessity
of
spending
one
day
away
from
town
he
could
not
possibly
survive
through
two
in
fact
he
tore
himself
away
by
the
very
earliest
train
in
his
habits
he
was
an
early
little
man
not
with
reluctance
but
delight
by
so
early
a
train
indeed
that
he
had
left
long
before
his
came
down
clive
did
the
honours
and
sped
the
parting
guest
she
poor
lady
was
not
used
to
quite
such
early
hours
and
felt
a
little
out
of
sorts
but
she
did
her
best
shall
i
give
dear
lily
a
message
when
you
are
gone
ely
was
swallowing
ham
and
eggs
as
though
he
were
engaged
in
a
match
against
time
a
healthy
appetite
for
breakfast
was
one
of
his
strong
points
tell
her
that
dog
of
hers
is
ever
so
much
too
fat
pompey
who
was
at
that
moment
reclining
on
a
cushion
on
the
rug
was
perhaps
a
trifle
stout
say
about
as
broad
as
he
was
long
still
clive
did
not
like
the
observation
all
the
same
pompey
is
not
lily
dog
but
mine
ah
then
if
i
were
you
i
starve
the
beggar
for
a
week
clive
bridled
if
she
had
a
tender
point
it
was
her
dog
i
can
assure
you
ely
that
the
greatest
care
is
taken
in
the
selection
of
dear
pompey
food
that
where
it
is
you
take
too
much
shut
him
in
the
stable
with
a
spratt
biscuit
to
keep
him
company
a
spratt
biscuit
pompey
would
sooner
die
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
him
if
he
did
by
the
look
of
him
he
ca
find
much
fun
in
living
it
all
that
he
can
do
to
breathe
it
seems
to
me
every
woman
must
have
some
beast
for
a
pet
an
aunt
of
mine
has
got
a
cat
her
cat
ought
to
meet
your
dog
they
both
of
them
be
thinner
before
they
went
away
it
is
not
surprising
that
ely
did
not
leave
an
altogether
pleasant
impression
when
he
had
gone
that
last
allusion
to
his
aunt
cat
rankled
in
the
old
lady
mind
a
cat
my
precious
pompey
she
raised
the
apoplectic
creature
in
her
arms
when
you
have
such
an
objection
to
a
cat
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
such
a
thing
even
when
it
is
spoken
only
in
jest
but
ely
had
not
spoken
in
jest
he
was
not
a
jesting
kind
of
man
when
miss
truscott
made
her
appearance
she
asked
no
questions
about
her
lover
if
he
had
sent
a
message
or
if
he
indeed
had
gone
she
showed
no
curiosity
upon
these
points
at
all
she
seemed
in
a
dreamy
frame
of
mind
as
if
her
thoughts
were
not
of
things
of
life
but
of
things
of
air
she
dawdled
over
the
eating
nothing
all
the
while
and
when
she
had
dismissed
the
meal
she
dawdled
in
an
easy
chair
such
behaviour
was
unusual
for
her
for
she
was
not
a
dawdling
kind
of
girl
chapter
vi
the
wooing
in
the
wood
in
the
afternoon
she
took
a
book
and
went
for
a
ramble
out
of
doors
it
was
a
novel
of
the
school
and
only
the
other
day
the
first
portion
of
the
story
had
impressed
her
with
the
belief
that
it
was
written
by
a
person
who
had
sounded
the
heights
and
depths
of
life
she
thought
differently
now
it
was
the
story
of
a
woman
who
for
love
sake
had
almost
but
not
quite
thrown
her
life
away
this
seemed
to
her
absurd
for
in
the
light
of
her
new
philosophy
she
thought
she
knew
that
the
thing
called
love
was
in
the
world
and
for
love
sake
to
throw
one
life
away
it
was
not
until
she
reached
a
leafy
glade
which
ran
down
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
that
she
opened
the
book
she
seated
herself
on
a
little
mossy
bank
with
her
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
great
old
tree
and
placed
the
book
on
her
knees
after
she
had
read
for
a
time
she
began
to
be
annoyed
the
heroine
firmly
persuaded
that
life
without
love
was
worthless
was
calmly
arranging
to
sacrifice
as
fine
prospects
as
a
woman
ever
had
so
as
to
enable
her
to
sink
to
the
social
position
of
her
lover
an
artisan
the
artisan
belonged
to
the
new
gospel
which
teaches
that
it
is
only
artisans
who
have
a
right
to
live
he
was
a
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
hundred
earls
as
a
who
declined
to
take
large
prices
for
his
work
he
considered
that
she
was
in
an
infinitely
lower
sphere
than
he
a
state
of
degradation
to
be
sorrowed
over
at
the
best
so
she
was
making
the
most
complicated
arrangements
to
free
herself
from
the
paternity
and
wealth
of
the
hundred
earls
miss
truscott
became
exceedingly
annoyed
at
the
picture
of
devotion
presented
by
these
two
and
threw
the
book
from
her
in
disgust
what
nonsense
it
all
is
how
people
do
exaggerate
these
things
i
do
believe
that
love
makes
the
slightest
difference
in
life
i
do
believe
that
people
love
a
good
dinner
or
a
pretty
frock
or
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
but
anything
else
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
significant
gesture
there
may
be
people
somewhere
who
believe
in
love
but
even
that
sort
is
the
love
that
loves
and
rides
away
as
for
love
in
married
life
in
the
present
state
of
society
if
it
did
exist
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
most
uncomfortable
thing
about
the
whole
affair
ely
is
a
sensible
man
he
wants
a
wife
not
a
woman
who
loves
him
the
royal
road
to
marriage
as
miss
truscott
arrived
at
this
conclusion
she
rose
from
her
mossy
seat
and
shook
herself
all
over
as
if
she
were
shaking
off
the
last
remnants
of
her
belief
in
love
miss
truscott
she
stood
amazed
motionless
with
a
curious
sudden
fascination
as
the
sound
of
a
voice
fell
on
her
ears
it
came
again
miss
truscott
wo
you
turn
and
look
at
me
she
turned
and
looked
and
there
was
a
man
she
seemed
wonderstruck
a
very
perceptible
change
came
over
her
she
became
more
womanly
as
she
looked
softer
more
feminine
the
scornful
look
passed
from
her
eyes
and
face
and
bearing
she
became
almost
afraid
summers
is
it
you
it
was
a
new
voice
which
spoke
a
voice
which
ely
would
never
live
to
hear
and
in
it
there
was
a
hidden
music
which
was
sweeter
that
the
music
of
the
birds
yes
miss
truscott
it
is
i
he
held
out
his
hand
she
timidly
advanced
and
he
advanced
a
step
and
their
two
hands
met
and
their
eyes
met
too
and
both
of
them
were
still
then
she
gently
disengaged
her
hand
and
looked
at
the
bracken
at
her
feet
some
spirit
of
the
wild
wood
must
have
led
me
i
have
come
straight
up
from
the
station
here
it
must
have
been
some
curious
instinct
which
told
me
where
you
would
be
found
oh
i
am
often
here
you
know
that
i
am
often
here
i
know
you
used
to
be
i
think
that
most
of
my
habits
are
still
unchanged
and
where
have
you
been
this
great
long
time
i
thought
that
you
would
never
come
again
did
you
think
that
is
that
true
he
leaned
forward
he
spoke
in
a
low
eager
insistent
tone
which
for
some
cause
made
the
blood
surge
about
the
region
of
her
heart
and
made
her
conscious
that
new
life
was
in
her
veins
oh
i
did
not
think
of
it
at
all
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
you
know
and
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
you
have
been
with
me
in
my
dreams
both
day
and
night
your
face
has
stared
at
me
from
every
canvas
which
i
touched
you
were
at
the
end
of
every
brush
everything
i
tried
to
paint
turned
into
you
i
thought
my
heart
would
burst
at
the
anticipation
of
meeting
you
again
she
was
silent
for
the
world
she
could
not
have
spoken
then
this
sceptic
maiden
who
but
a
moment
back
was
so
incredulous
of
the
existence
of
the
thing
called
love
was
stricken
dumb
conquered
by
the
magic
of
the
spell
woven
by
this
man
tongue
and
eyes
i
tried
to
paint
you
and
i
failed
there
are
fifty
failures
in
my
room
but
one
night
there
came
to
me
the
glamour
of
my
lady
eyes
at
the
first
dawn
of
day
i
stood
before
my
canvas
and
all
at
once
as
if
it
were
by
witchcraft
i
had
you
there
you
shall
look
at
that
portrait
one
fine
day
and
you
shall
know
that
i
have
you
even
when
you
are
not
near
and
so
through
all
the
weary
time
you
have
been
there
sleeping
and
waking
i
have
had
you
by
my
side
and
you
not
once
have
thought
of
me
silence
then
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
i
have
thought
of
you
at
times
what
times
there
was
a
pause
before
she
spoke
as
if
each
was
conscious
of
a
fascination
in
the
other
glance
eyes
continued
looking
into
eyes
all
times
i
think
lady
of
my
heart
desire
he
still
carried
the
bludgeon
which
we
have
seen
he
had
in
office
he
let
it
fall
upon
the
ground
he
stretched
out
his
two
hands
and
as
if
unconsciously
she
yielded
hers
to
his
so
they
were
face
to
face
hands
clasped
in
hands
love
lives
no
longer
now
they
tell
us
that
it
is
only
in
the
fables
it
is
found
yet
i
think
that
they
are
wrong
nay
it
is
certain
that
i
know
they
are
for
i
love
you
better
than
my
life
silence
even
the
myriad
sounds
of
nature
seemed
to
be
suddenly
quite
still
there
was
no
rustling
of
leaves
no
twittering
of
birds
there
was
not
even
audible
the
murmuring
of
the
sea
and
he
went
on
i
pray
you
tell
me
do
you
love
me
willy
that
was
all
she
said
then
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
my
dear
he
said
then
they
were
still
he
did
not
even
draw
her
to
him
he
only
held
her
hands
and
looked
upon
her
face
and
she
regarded
him
with
shy
proud
eyes
why
have
you
been
so
long
because
i
had
made
myself
a
promise
what
promise
that
i
would
earn
my
prize
how
could
you
do
that
ah
how
indeed
for
truly
it
could
not
be
earned
but
when
i
saw
you
first
i
was
the
laziest
of
men
until
that
hour
i
had
thrown
my
life
away
i
told
myself
that
until
i
had
done
something
to
redeem
the
past
until
i
had
made
my
mark
upon
the
time
i
might
not
make
my
petition
for
the
prize
then
it
is
your
fault
my
friend
if
there
is
a
fault
it
certainly
is
mine
for
i
am
full
of
fault
but
what
especial
evil
have
i
done
she
removed
her
hands
from
his
and
tapping
a
pebble
with
her
little
foot
she
smiled
you
can
never
guess
is
it
so
black
a
crime
suddenly
she
put
her
two
hands
to
her
face
and
laughed
but
her
cheeks
were
crimson
all
the
same
oh
what
have
i
done
i
shall
never
dare
to
tell
she
peeped
at
him
round
the
edges
of
her
hands
shall
you
be
angry
with
me
will
never
if
you
call
me
will
do
you
know
but
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
she
removed
her
hands
and
putting
them
behind
her
back
looked
at
him
shyly
and
then
looked
down
do
you
know
i
thought
that
you
would
never
come
again
he
laughed
and
there
was
something
in
his
laughter
made
her
laugh
too
so
i
was
not
happy
for
i
loved
you
all
the
time
he
laughed
again
and
putting
his
arm
about
her
waist
drew
her
closer
to
his
side
do
you
know
what
happened
yesterday
did
the
cat
drink
all
the
cream
no
worse
than
that
for
we
have
got
a
cat
have
you
forgotten
pompey
sir
somebody
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
what
who
do
you
know
frederic
ely
good
heavens
was
he
the
man
what
man
willy
surely
you
do
not
know
so
that
was
what
he
was
coming
into
the
country
for
to
think
of
the
little
beggar
impudence
and
i
wished
him
luck
by
gad
he
laughed
but
she
was
still
willy
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
all
about
it
then
why
it
was
a
bargain
sweet
he
was
to
try
his
luck
and
then
i
mine
i
was
so
sure
of
you
you
see
she
released
herself
from
his
embrace
and
again
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
shivered
what
have
you
done
it
was
this
way
let
me
unfold
the
tale
i
went
to
ash
and
told
him
what
you
know
how
all
my
life
was
centred
in
my
love
for
you
he
told
me
that
just
before
i
came
another
man
had
brought
to
him
the
tale
surely
not
quite
the
same
surely
he
did
not
say
that
all
his
life
was
centred
in
his
love
for
me
no
not
exactly
that
yet
sweet
why
not
for
who
shall
know
you
and
not
love
you
as
his
life
but
at
least
another
man
had
come
to
him
who
wished
to
win
your
hand
that
priceless
hand
and
he
had
given
him
his
word
so
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
try
his
fortune
first
and
if
he
failed
i
knew
that
he
would
fail
i
should
try
mine
and
if
i
won
ah
how
i
longed
to
win
mr
ash
would
crown
success
with
his
consent
silence
reigned
again
they
stood
a
little
way
apart
he
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
she
with
hers
upon
the
ground
what
have
i
done
the
words
were
whispered
in
an
undertone
then
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sudden
fire
in
her
eyes
do
you
know
what
i
have
done
i
have
promised
this
other
man
to
be
his
wife
what
good
god
lily
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
i
said
i
would
i
thought
that
you
were
false
you
see
you
thought
that
i
was
false
but
it
is
madness
it
is
a
foolish
dream
do
not
look
so
utterly
dismayed
you
said
that
you
would
not
be
vexed
you
know
besides
now
it
is
another
thing
another
thing
but
lily
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
have
done
i
will
tell
you
just
exactly
what
it
is
that
i
have
done
to
begin
then
you
see
i
have
not
been
happy
ever
since
you
went
away
you
foolish
maid
and
yet
you
wisest
of
them
all
i
waited
oh
will
i
waited
such
a
weary
time
i
thought
that
you
would
write
or
or
do
something
that
you
never
did
and
at
last
i
began
to
think
that
waiting
was
in
vain
and
when
i
was
in
the
most
hopeless
of
my
hopeless
moods
it
was
no
further
back
than
yesterday
yet
it
seemed
years
ago
she
put
forth
her
hand
and
touched
his
arm
and
he
laughed
beneath
his
breath
a
letter
came
from
ash
he
said
that
ely
was
coming
here
i
showed
the
letter
to
my
aunt
she
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
would
do
exactly
what
my
guardian
wished
me
to
as
though
it
were
a
decree
that
was
written
in
the
skies
so
when
he
came
and
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
just
out
of
spite
and
wickedness
i
said
i
would
he
never
asked
me
if
i
loved
him
he
never
pretended
even
to
love
me
it
was
just
a
bargain
i
was
to
be
his
wife
my
little
love
what
is
it
you
have
done
and
now
pray
what
is
it
that
you
mean
to
do
i
shall
write
and
tell
him
i
have
changed
my
mind
changed
your
mind
what
do
you
suppose
that
he
will
say
to
that
why
what
can
he
say
it
is
like
a
commercial
treaty
which
is
in
the
air
there
are
some
of
the
clauses
to
which
i
am
unable
to
agree
so
i
withdraw
from
the
negotiations
and
refuse
to
sign
one
thing
is
sure
you
can
not
be
his
wife
will
i
am
just
like
you
i
love
you
better
than
my
life
sweetheart
then
i
have
won
the
prize
i
thought
that
i
had
won
the
prize
will
you
forgive
me
my
presumption
in
that
i
thought
that
i
had
won
the
prize
you
should
not
have
kept
me
so
long
waiting
it
is
your
fault
that
i
have
sinned
you
shall
not
have
cause
again
to
esteem
me
false
and
observe
fair
maid
i
had
a
higher
estimate
of
you
willy
that
is
unkind
then
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
and
when
he
saw
that
sweet
face
upturned
and
those
sweet
eyes
what
could
he
do
but
kiss
not
once
nor
twice
but
many
times
those
sweetest
lips
and
by
this
time
the
two
were
close
together
he
had
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
do
you
know
that
from
my
point
of
view
fair
queen
this
was
worth
waiting
for
and
do
you
know
sir
that
is
my
point
of
view
as
well
then
there
was
silence
and
they
feasted
on
the
love
that
was
in
each
other
eyes
lily
mr
summers
and
while
they
were
still
engaged
in
this
delectable
pursuit
all
at
once
their
names
were
spoken
from
behind
and
turning
they
saw
that
clive
was
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
chapter
vii
clive
and
pompey
clive
had
the
faithful
pompey
in
her
arms
that
faithful
animal
was
out
for
exercise
and
exercise
meant
as
a
rule
to
him
being
carried
all
the
way
his
mistress
stared
at
the
lovers
and
the
lovers
taken
aback
for
a
moment
stared
at
her
can
i
believe
my
eyes
in
her
amazement
she
let
the
faithful
creature
fall
pompey
gave
a
dismal
groan
he
did
not
belong
to
the
order
of
dogs
who
can
fall
with
comfort
to
themselves
where
he
fell
he
lay
in
the
agitation
of
her
feelings
clive
did
not
notice
the
quadruped
distress
lily
is
it
possible
it
is
my
niece
quite
possible
it
seemed
and
not
at
all
surprising
either
recovering
from
the
first
momentary
shock
miss
truscott
was
the
most
charming
niece
alive
removing
herself
from
the
gentleman
near
neighbourhood
she
inclined
her
body
and
gave
a
little
graceful
curtsey
a
prettier
curtsey
never
yet
was
seen
yes
aunty
it
is
i
then
she
drew
herself
up
straight
you
always
said
i
was
your
niece
then
she
turned
to
the
gentleman
willy
do
you
know
my
aunt
summers
laughed
the
old
lady
bridled
but
the
gentleman
not
at
all
abashed
took
off
his
hat
and
advanced
to
her
with
outstretched
hand
clive
it
is
twelve
months
since
i
saw
you
i
am
afraid
you
have
forgotten
me
but
he
was
mistaken
if
he
thought
that
she
would
take
his
hand
there
never
was
an
old
lady
with
a
stiffer
mien
and
she
was
at
her
stiffest
now
she
had
her
mittened
hands
down
by
her
sides
and
looked
him
in
the
face
as
though
she
could
not
see
that
he
was
there
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
sir
this
was
a
fib
but
there
are
occasions
when
fibs
must
be
expected
my
name
is
summers
william
summers
i
thought
i
heard
you
just
now
mention
me
by
name
and
i
at
least
have
not
forgotten
the
pleasant
hours
i
spent
with
you
last
year
lily
i
must
trouble
you
to
come
with
me
that
was
the
only
answer
he
received
to
his
small
compliment
with
her
most
unbending
air
the
old
lady
turned
to
go
but
the
impression
she
desired
to
convey
was
in
a
measure
spoiled
in
sweeping
round
her
action
could
only
be
described
as
sweeping
round
she
kicked
the
faithful
pompey
and
when
the
faithful
pompey
received
that
kick
he
raised
a
dreadful
howl
and
that
dreadful
howl
awoke
the
echoes
far
and
wide
in
an
instant
summers
had
the
creature
in
his
arms
poor
pompey
i
am
afraid
you
have
hurt
him
clive
how
well
he
looks
see
clive
he
seems
in
pain
i
afraid
you
must
have
kicked
him
in
the
side
and
in
his
condition
that
is
rather
a
serious
thing
do
you
know
me
pompey
it
appeared
that
pompey
did
for
in
a
feeble
kind
of
way
he
put
out
his
tongue
and
licked
his
protector
nose
such
a
sight
could
not
but
touch
the
lady
heart
still
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
unbend
i
must
trouble
you
sir
to
let
me
have
my
dog
permit
me
to
carry
him
for
you
towards
the
house
i
sure
he
is
in
pain
see
how
still
he
is
if
stillness
were
a
sign
of
pain
then
the
faithful
beast
must
have
been
pretty
constantly
in
pain
for
motion
or
emotion
of
any
sort
was
not
in
pompey
line
clive
would
have
grasped
the
subterfuge
if
she
had
been
left
alone
but
her
perfidious
niece
came
to
the
gentleman
aid
she
began
to
stroke
and
caress
the
faithful
beast
poor
pompey
poor
pompey
then
i
hope
he
has
not
broken
any
bones
do
you
think
it
is
his
ribs
miss
truscott
back
was
turned
to
clive
if
the
aunt
had
seen
the
way
in
which
her
niece
glanced
under
her
long
eyelashes
at
the
gentleman
in
front
of
her
she
would
have
seized
the
animal
and
marched
away
i
scarcely
think
it
is
his
ribs
it
was
not
probable
considering
how
they
were
swathed
in
fat
perhaps
it
is
his
leg
i
hope
that
it
is
not
summers
threw
such
a
tone
of
doubt
into
this
expression
of
his
hopes
that
clive
heart
gave
quite
a
jump
her
pompey
leg
broken
and
by
her
but
she
was
not
by
any
means
going
to
give
in
yet
there
was
the
bearded
gentleman
holding
the
wheezing
quadruped
as
though
it
were
the
most
precious
thing
on
earth
and
there
was
her
niece
very
close
in
front
of
him
all
her
sense
of
moral
rectitude
was
up
in
arms
lily
i
am
surprised
at
you
surprised
at
me
aunty
why
because
you
have
broken
pompey
leg
i
did
do
it
it
was
you
supposing
he
should
die
you
know
what
a
delicate
constitution
he
always
had
it
is
quite
possible
the
injury
is
less
serious
than
we
suppose
this
the
gentleman
suggested
in
a
consoling
kind
of
way
though
here
some
one
gave
the
dog
a
pinch
and
the
dog
gave
expression
to
his
feelings
in
a
howl
though
decidedly
he
seems
in
pain
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
on
with
him
straight
to
the
house
lily
i
insist
upon
your
coming
here
miss
truscott
did
as
she
was
told
with
meek
face
and
downcast
eyes
she
fell
in
decorously
by
the
old
lady
side
summers
ignored
and
snubbed
but
still
triumphant
bore
pompey
away
in
front
lily
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
think
you
must
have
let
pompey
fall
and
then
have
kicked
him
when
he
fell
i
can
not
see
how
you
can
have
done
it
you
are
so
careful
as
a
rule
i
am
not
speaking
about
the
dog
you
know
that
very
well
i
am
speaking
of
the
the
extraordinary
scene
i
interrupted
willy
was
telling
me
that
he
loved
me
willy
was
telling
you
what
and
who
is
willy
pray
willy
is
summers
christian
name
lily
are
you
stark
raving
mad
have
you
forgotten
what
happened
yesterday
are
you
aware
that
it
is
not
hours
since
you
promised
frederic
ely
to
be
his
wife
yes
auntie
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
you
have
what
i
have
changed
my
mind
clive
was
so
overcome
that
she
sank
down
on
a
grassy
bank
which
they
were
passing
it
was
a
thing
she
had
not
done
for
years
she
was
always
under
the
impression
that
the
grass
was
damp
even
when
it
burned
you
as
you
touched
it
with
the
palm
of
your
hand
lily
either
you
are
mad
or
i
must
be
changed
your
mind
do
you
think
that
in
such
a
matter
it
is
possible
for
a
woman
to
change
her
mind
it
would
seem
to
be
would
it
especially
when
you
look
at
me
you
treat
it
as
a
jest
the
most
astounding
behaviour
i
ever
heard
of
i
do
wish
to
forget
myself
if
you
have
done
so
i
simply
call
it
the
most
astounding
behaviour
i
ever
heard
of
a
niece
of
mine
perhaps
that
it
i
i
have
such
a
remarkable
aunt
the
temptation
was
irresistible
but
the
effect
was
serious
for
some
moments
clive
sat
speechless
with
indignation
then
she
rose
from
the
mossy
bank
and
walked
away
without
a
word
left
behind
miss
truscott
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
laughed
a
little
guiltily
it
seemed
then
she
went
after
so
the
march
to
the
house
resolved
itself
into
a
procession
of
three
chapter
viii
rosenbaum
six
daughters
in
the
meantime
ely
was
dreaming
of
his
love
it
sounds
contradictory
at
first
bearing
in
mind
that
he
was
not
a
man
of
sentiment
but
the
fact
was
that
in
his
case
absence
made
the
heart
grow
distinctly
fonder
by
the
time
he
reached
ryde
miss
truscott
occupied
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
he
never
even
troubled
himself
about
the
purchase
of
a
paper
which
was
fortunate
for
at
that
hour
none
had
yet
arrived
from
town
and
to
him
the
local
prints
were
loathsome
all
the
way
on
the
boat
he
dreamed
yes
literally
dreamed
of
the
girl
he
left
behind
him
more
than
once
incredible
though
it
may
appear
he
sighed
she
do
care
for
me
a
snap
not
a
single
rap
by
jove
she
do
he
sighed
when
he
said
this
for
for
some
occult
reason
the
idea
did
not
seem
to
amuse
him
so
much
as
it
had
done
last
night
i
do
know
why
she
should
though
perhaps
she
thought
i
want
her
more
i
did
then
though
i
do
see
why
she
should
if
i
did
i
know
how
to
make
a
girl
like
me
as
well
as
any
man
look
at
the
rosenbaums
he
sighed
again
it
was
look
at
the
rosenbaums
indeed
when
he
thought
of
those
six
young
women
with
their
noses
and
the
fringe
of
hair
upon
their
upper
lips
and
of
their
father
and
then
of
miss
truscott
that
vision
of
a
fair
woman
with
her
noble
bearing
her
lovely
face
and
her
wondrous
eyes
the
contrast
went
deeply
home
he
felt
that
he
was
a
lucky
and
yet
not
altogether
a
lucky
man
she
going
to
be
my
wife
that
one
thing
anyhow
the
isle
of
wight
is
a
great
place
for
honeymoons
it
lends
itself
naturally
to
couples
in
a
certain
phase
of
their
existence
such
a
couple
were
on
board
the
boat
with
ely
their
demeanour
was
tender
towards
each
other
couple
of
idiots
said
ely
to
himself
as
he
observed
this
pair
it
makes
a
man
feel
ill
to
look
at
them
she
was
a
pretty
girl
and
he
was
not
an
ugly
man
she
hung
upon
his
arm
and
looked
into
his
eyes
it
was
plain
the
honeymoon
was
not
yet
done
for
them
in
spite
of
his
disgust
ely
found
himself
thinking
almost
unconsciously
of
another
figure
and
of
another
pair
of
eyes
of
that
other
figure
hanging
upon
his
arm
and
of
that
other
pair
of
eyes
looking
into
his
he
sighed
again
she
does
care
for
me
a
snap
by
jove
instead
of
amusing
him
it
seemed
that
this
reflection
began
to
give
him
pain
the
little
man
looked
quite
disconsolate
i
make
her
though
i
will
if
if
it
costs
me
a
thousand
pounds
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
stating
the
cost
he
was
willing
to
incur
at
a
much
higher
sum
than
this
he
had
been
on
the
very
verge
of
saying
that
he
would
make
her
care
for
him
if
it
cost
him
every
penny
he
had
but
prudence
stepped
in
and
he
limited
the
amount
to
be
squandered
to
a
thousand
pounds
which
was
not
so
bad
for
a
man
who
did
not
believe
in
sentiment
but
a
singular
change
had
come
over
him
between
shanklin
and
stokes
bay
the
change
was
emphasised
by
a
little
encounter
which
he
had
with
a
friend
in
the
train
he
had
taken
his
seat
in
the
corner
of
a
carriage
when
the
door
was
darkened
by
a
big
stout
man
who
was
all
hair
and
whiskers
and
gorgeous
apparel
what
ely
my
boy
is
it
bossible
it
is
you
rosenbaum
what
the
devil
brings
you
here
ah
what
the
teffel
is
it
brings
you
rosenbaum
spoke
with
a
decidedly
german
accent
he
settled
himself
in
the
seat
in
front
of
ely
and
beamed
at
him
all
jewellery
and
smiles
it
was
as
though
some
one
had
applied
a
cold
douche
to
the
small
of
ely
back
he
was
dreaming
of
the
sweetest
eyes
and
his
friend
the
man
who
had
been
hammered
twice
appeared
upon
the
scene
it
was
a
shock
but
rosenbaum
seemed
beamingly
unconscious
of
anything
of
the
kind
the
train
started
and
he
began
a
conversation
which
rather
hung
fire
by
the
way
it
is
some
time
since
we
have
seen
you
in
queen
gate
queen
gate
was
where
rosenbaum
resided
after
each
hammering
mysterious
process
he
had
moved
into
a
larger
house
it
had
been
first
earl
court
then
cromwell
road
and
now
queen
gate
been
so
much
engaged
rosenbaum
was
smoking
a
huge
cigar
and
kept
puffing
out
great
clouds
of
smoke
ely
was
engaged
on
a
smaller
article
which
scarcely
produced
any
smoke
at
all
they
had
the
compartment
to
themselves
ely
would
rather
have
seen
it
full
he
knew
his
friend
miriam
has
missed
you
miriam
was
the
eldest
of
the
six
the
one
whose
nose
and
moustache
were
most
developed
a
sprightly
maiden
of
thirty
or
so
has
leah
leah
was
a
year
or
so
younger
than
her
sister
and
quite
as
keen
ely
drew
in
his
lips
he
had
once
played
cards
with
miss
leah
rosenbaum
and
detected
her
in
the
act
of
cheating
he
admired
the
woman
of
business
but
regretted
his
eighteenpence
i
no
doubt
she
has
that
a
fine
girl
leah
a
smart
girl
too
ely
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
her
smartness
not
the
least
she
be
a
fortune
to
any
man
she
very
fond
of
you
ely
was
certainly
not
fond
of
her
but
he
could
scarcely
say
so
to
her
father
face
so
he
kept
still
rachel
she
miss
you
too
silence
ely
saw
plainly
that
he
was
going
to
be
missed
by
all
the
six
since
he
could
not
escape
from
the
train
while
it
was
travelling
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
an
hour
the
only
course
open
was
to
sit
still
and
say
as
little
as
he
could
he
knew
his
friend
too
well
to
suppose
that
anything
he
could
say
would
induce
him
to
turn
the
conversation
into
other
channels
the
fond
father
went
blandly
on
she
say
you
gave
her
a
little
gift
eh
that
so
never
gave
her
anything
in
my
life
no
she
says
you
gave
her
a
lock
of
your
hair
it
was
little
to
you
it
was
much
to
her
rachel
she
treasures
up
these
little
things
she
show
it
me
one
day
she
says
she
keep
it
here
rosenbaum
patted
his
waistcoat
in
the
region
where
his
heart
might
anatomically
be
supposed
to
be
i
tell
you
what
it
is
rosenbaum
your
girls
are
like
their
father
smart
we
not
fools
admitted
rosenbaum
one
night
when
i
was
asleep
on
the
couch
in
that
back
room
of
yours
in
cromwell
road
before
you
failed
last
time
it
is
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
this
allusion
was
meant
to
sting
but
rosenbaum
smoked
blandly
on
that
girl
of
yours
cut
off
some
of
my
hair
and
drew
blood
in
doing
it
by
george
ah
she
says
you
give
it
her
from
sympathy
my
friend
she
admire
you
very
much
that
girl
ely
kept
silence
if
there
was
any
one
of
the
six
he
disliked
more
than
the
others
it
was
the
young
lady
whom
her
father
said
admired
him
very
much
miss
rachel
rosenbaum
some
fathers
if
they
had
had
the
names
of
three
of
their
daughters
received
in
this
rather
frigid
way
would
have
changed
the
subject
perhaps
but
if
rosenbaum
had
not
been
a
persevering
man
his
address
would
not
have
been
queen
gate
besides
rosenbaum
was
dead
and
he
had
to
act
the
parts
of
mother
and
father
too
and
there
were
six
judith
she
miss
you
too
this
was
the
fourth
there
still
were
two
to
follow
ely
resolved
to
have
a
little
plunge
upon
his
own
account
doing
anything
in
unified
rosenbaum
looked
at
him
puffed
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
smiled
i
say
judith
she
miss
you
too
and
i
said
anything
in
unified
rosenbaum
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
great
fat
jewelled
hand
on
ely
knee
now
my
friend
there
is
a
girl
for
you
plump
tender
what
an
eye
and
what
a
nose
and
a
moustache
was
on
ely
lips
but
he
refrained
that
girl
just
and
she
weigh
a
hundred
and
seventy
pound
she
do
credit
to
any
man
and
my
goodness
how
she
is
fond
of
you
my
boy
a
vision
passed
before
ely
mental
eye
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
left
behind
and
then
he
thought
of
the
young
lady
whose
chief
qualification
was
that
she
weighed
a
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
at
she
not
a
worrying
girl
that
judith
that
the
sort
of
wife
for
a
man
to
have
who
wants
to
live
an
easy
life
she
let
him
do
just
what
he
please
and
never
say
a
word
ely
fidgeted
in
his
seat
i
say
rosenbaum
i
wish
you
try
some
other
theme
rosenbaum
held
up
his
fat
forefinger
with
its
half
a
dozen
rings
and
wagged
it
in
ely
face
but
the
great
point
is
sarah
my
good
friend
there
is
something
between
you
and
she
what
the
dickens
do
you
mean
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
what
passed
between
you
on
the
river
that
fine
day
what
fine
day
what
fine
day
so
there
has
been
more
than
one
that
i
did
not
know
the
one
it
was
enough
for
me
and
upon
my
word
with
all
due
respect
to
miss
sarah
rosenbaum
it
was
enough
for
me
you
did
not
kiss
her
eh
you
did
not
kiss
her
that
fine
day
i
do
know
if
i
kissed
her
or
she
kissed
me
i
say
rosenbaum
those
girls
of
yours
do
seem
to
keep
many
secrets
from
their
father
that
is
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
lived
you
will
do
justice
to
her
eh
i
hope
i
should
do
justice
to
every
girl
so
that
is
it
you
would
marry
half
a
dozen
perhaps
by
george
i
do
believe
you
offer
any
objection
if
i
wanted
to
rosenbaum
sat
back
in
his
seat
apparently
this
observation
did
go
home
he
appeared
to
reflect
but
he
showed
that
he
was
by
no
means
beaten
by
suddenly
discovering
a
fresh
attack
my
good
friend
you
think
you
are
a
clever
man
i
allow
you
are
no
fool
but
you
have
met
your
match
in
me
in
his
secret
heart
ely
was
quite
willing
to
allow
the
fact
you
have
played
with
my
six
daughters
very
good
you
have
trifled
with
their
hearts
i
say
not
any
word
but
there
is
one
of
them
you
must
marry
and
ruth
is
she
ely
was
silent
he
kept
his
eyes
cast
down
rosenbaum
on
the
other
hand
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
good
friend
face
come
i
am
her
father
when
is
it
to
be
then
ely
did
look
up
the
two
friends
glances
met
ely
certainly
did
not
flinch
it
wo
do
try
some
other
lay
what
you
mean
try
some
other
lay
mean
what
i
say
you
never
asked
her
to
marry
you
i
swear
i
never
did
you
never
gave
her
to
understand
that
you
wished
her
for
your
wife
eh
i
not
responsible
for
her
understanding
so
that
is
it
i
see
griffith
of
tokenhouse
yard
is
your
solicitor
not
so
rosenbaum
took
out
a
and
a
what
it
matter
to
you
my
good
friend
it
matters
this
before
we
reach
waterloo
you
tell
me
the
day
on
which
you
marry
ruth
or
a
writ
issues
for
breach
of
promise
issue
fifty
writs
for
all
i
care
you
have
played
with
my
six
daughters
but
we
have
you
on
the
last
at
least
we
see
i
guess
we
will
take
my
advice
rosenbaum
and
do
you
be
a
fool
i
never
asked
your
daughter
in
my
life
to
marry
me
we
talk
of
that
a
little
later
on
there
is
a
letter
and
some
other
little
things
which
will
make
a
sensation
when
they
are
produced
in
court
you
understand
that
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
you
do
not
break
my
daughter
heart
which
of
them
all
six
at
present
it
is
with
ruth
we
are
concerned
oh
ruth
be
hanged
with
that
observation
the
conversation
closed
the
remainder
of
the
journey
passed
in
silence
but
when
they
reached
waterloo
rosenbaum
remarked
well
my
friend
what
is
it
to
be
will
you
name
the
day
name
your
grandmother
ely
courteously
rejoined
and
with
that
courteous
rejoinder
he
left
the
train
chapter
ix
ely
has
a
letter
ely
took
a
cab
into
the
city
on
the
road
he
stopped
to
buy
a
ring
he
was
the
kind
of
man
whose
determination
is
intensified
by
opposition
he
had
been
half
in
love
with
miss
truscott
before
he
met
his
german
friend
now
in
his
own
peculiar
way
he
was
quite
miss
ruth
rosenbaum
was
the
youngest
and
most
prepossessing
of
the
six
and
that
there
had
been
certain
passages
between
them
he
was
well
aware
but
in
any
case
her
father
attempt
to
force
his
daughter
down
his
throat
would
have
had
the
effect
of
making
him
fly
off
at
a
tangent
in
quite
another
direction
now
the
effect
it
had
upon
him
was
to
send
him
off
to
purchase
miss
truscott
an
but
he
was
the
man
of
business
even
then
the
jeweller
found
some
difficulty
in
meeting
his
requirements
what
ely
wanted
was
an
article
of
the
greatest
value
at
the
smallest
cost
for
instance
for
a
ring
priced
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
he
offered
fifteen
pounds
and
this
with
such
an
air
of
making
a
bid
that
the
tradesman
did
not
know
whether
to
treat
it
as
an
insult
or
a
jest
finally
he
expended
twenty
pounds
and
had
his
value
for
it
rest
assured
directly
he
entered
the
stock
exchange
he
encountered
ash
i
had
your
wire
began
that
gentleman
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
boy
yes
ely
looked
the
other
straight
in
the
face
which
was
a
trick
he
had
when
there
was
something
which
he
particularly
wished
to
say
then
he
slipped
his
arm
through
ash
and
drew
that
gentleman
aside
she
a
fine
girl
ash
finer
than
i
thought
she
was
finest
girl
in
england
in
the
world
by
george
she
is
ash
was
a
little
surprised
at
his
friend
enthusiasm
but
he
let
no
sign
of
this
escape
him
she
a
good
girl
too
my
boy
best
girl
ever
yet
i
came
across
and
she
true
true
as
a
die
truer
truest
girl
ever
yet
i
saw
and
when
she
says
she
loves
a
man
ash
paused
he
glanced
at
his
friend
ely
gave
no
sign
when
she
says
she
loves
a
man
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
she
does
ely
looked
down
at
his
toes
then
up
at
ash
i
bought
the
ring
what
the
the
good
gad
no
i
never
thought
of
that
it
the
engagement
ring
i
got
the
other
one
comes
after
eh
i
gave
twenty
sovereigns
for
it
that
a
pile
what
the
smile
meant
in
ash
eyes
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
he
wanted
i
beat
him
down
said
i
seen
its
own
brother
at
attenborough
for
ten
there
was
a
pause
then
ely
began
again
i
say
ash
when
do
you
think
the
wedding
could
come
off
in
a
hurry
well
what
do
you
say
to
twelve
months
my
boy
twelve
months
twelve
months
be
hanged
a
month
enough
for
me
a
month
the
girl
wo
have
time
to
turn
herself
round
and
you
a
house
to
take
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
say
the
word
and
i
have
a
house
by
night
and
get
it
furnished
in
a
week
but
my
dear
boy
you
do
seem
to
be
aware
that
the
lady
generally
has
a
voice
in
that
kind
of
thing
you
say
a
month
and
i
make
it
right
with
her
you
may
marry
her
for
all
i
care
i
should
like
to
marry
her
said
ely
candidly
but
i
suppose
it
have
to
be
a
month
but
even
a
month
was
not
an
impassable
space
of
time
ely
reflected
that
there
were
a
good
many
things
which
must
be
done
it
should
be
a
lunar
month
he
decided
in
his
own
mind
his
time
would
be
much
occupied
the
days
would
quickly
pass
and
then
then
the
maid
with
the
big
eyes
the
finest
girl
in
the
world
the
best
and
the
truest
would
be
his
bride
his
happiness
was
consummated
on
the
following
morning
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
suggest
that
there
should
be
any
correspondence
he
was
not
a
man
who
was
fond
of
writing
himself
and
a
the
idea
of
a
sane
man
writing
a
was
an
idea
which
up
to
the
present
moment
had
never
entered
his
mind
and
that
in
spite
of
a
certain
unfortunate
document
which
was
in
the
possession
of
miss
ruth
rosenbaum
so
when
he
found
upon
his
breakfast
table
the
following
morning
a
large
square
envelope
addressed
to
frederic
ely
esq
in
an
unmistakably
feminine
hand
the
postmark
of
which
was
shanklin
his
heart
gave
quite
a
jump
it
was
from
miss
truscott
as
sure
as
fate
the
first
letter
from
his
love
chapter
x
the
amazing
contents
of
ely
letter
ely
played
with
that
letter
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
it
was
a
tender
morsel
a
which
must
not
be
hastily
dismissed
he
turned
it
over
and
over
examining
first
the
superscription
the
bold
flourishing
hand
in
which
she
had
penned
his
name
how
well
it
looked
the
first
time
his
name
had
been
inscribed
by
her
then
he
examined
the
reverse
the
monogram
he
could
make
it
out
quite
well
lily
truscott
he
blushed
as
he
caught
himself
in
the
act
of
raising
the
magic
letters
to
his
lips
then
he
laid
it
down
in
a
prominent
position
in
front
of
his
plate
and
studied
the
exterior
as
he
began
to
eat
i
wonder
what
she
has
to
say
ah
what
i
wonder
if
if
she
come
round
to
my
point
of
view
got
got
spoony
and
and
all
that
by
george
i
hope
she
has
what
with
the
food
he
had
in
his
mouth
and
the
sigh
he
was
almost
choked
i
think
every
woman
ought
to
love
the
man
she
going
to
marry
i
love
her
i
know
i
do
he
began
to
know
that
fact
too
well
the
man
who
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
sentiment
was
painfully
conscious
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
the
most
sentimental
of
men
i
mismanaged
the
affair
all
through
i
ought
to
have
told
her
that
i
loved
her
how
can
a
man
expect
a
girl
to
love
him
if
she
believe
that
he
loves
her
perhaps
she
has
written
to
say
that
she
can
conceal
the
fact
no
longer
that
she
loves
me
whether
i
want
her
to
or
do
by
george
i
hope
she
has
he
feasted
his
eyes
again
upon
the
envelope
and
helped
himself
to
another
serving
of
ham
and
eggs
i
thought
her
behaviour
was
a
trifle
cold
it
was
that
beastly
dog
that
did
it
how
can
a
man
make
himself
agreeable
to
a
woman
when
there
a
dog
ready
to
bite
his
nose
off
sitting
on
her
knee
still
i
thought
her
behaviour
was
a
trifle
cold
she
did
seem
to
pay
much
attention
to
what
i
had
to
say
i
believe
she
would
have
preferred
to
read
and
when
she
did
begin
to
talk
she
was
taking
at
one
all
over
the
place
as
it
were
he
sighed
and
took
another
egg
and
when
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
i
might
have
been
asking
her
to
take
a
tart
she
did
seem
to
be
interested
in
the
least
she
was
most
uncommon
anxious
to
treat
the
thing
in
a
kind
of
way
i
ought
to
have
been
so
particular
about
saying
i
was
a
business
man
that
was
a
mistake
i
know
it
was
he
sighed
again
he
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
by
george
if
she
writes
to
say
she
loves
me
i
i
give
a
hundred
pounds
he
took
the
letter
in
his
hands
i
wonder
if
she
does
in
his
anxiety
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
began
to
pace
the
room
holding
the
letter
tightly
in
his
hand
he
paused
before
the
mantelshelf
and
regarded
himself
in
the
glass
well
upon
my
word
i
never
thought
that
i
should
come
to
this
i
never
did
here
all
the
papers
and
goodness
knows
what
news
from
paris
and
i
have
looked
at
one
and
do
want
to
neither
the
truth
if
she
only
written
to
say
she
loves
me
whether
i
want
her
to
or
do
i
i
give
a
thousand
pounds
here
goes
i
stand
fooling
here
all
day
goodness
knows
what
the
state
of
things
in
the
city
may
be
he
was
about
to
tear
the
envelope
open
with
his
finger
he
changed
his
mind
she
may
have
written
something
on
the
flap
i
better
use
a
knife
he
used
a
knife
to
see
him
use
it
opening
an
envelope
might
have
been
the
most
delicate
operation
on
earth
now
for
it
he
heaved
the
greatest
sigh
of
all
by
george
if
only
to
confess
her
love
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
with
the
letter
spread
out
in
front
of
him
it
might
have
been
as
fragile
as
it
was
priceless
to
observe
the
ginger
way
in
which
he
opened
it
and
spread
it
out
then
he
arrayed
himself
for
its
perusal
with
as
much
precision
as
though
it
were
some
formal
and
rather
complicated
revelation
just
to
hand
from
the
gods
ely
i
say
she
might
have
said
fred
or
even
ely
it
rather
a
stiffish
way
of
writing
to
the
man
you
going
to
marry
do
you
know
a
line
with
reference
to
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
thought
it
better
to
let
you
know
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
your
wife
the
fact
is
i
am
going
to
marry
summers
instead
yours
truly
lily
truscott
ely
read
this
note
through
without
in
his
astonishment
being
in
the
least
able
to
grasp
its
meaning
what
what
the
blazes
is
all
this
he
ploughed
through
it
again
ely
it
evidently
meant
for
me
a
line
with
reference
to
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
what
she
mean
she
has
put
a
date
i
suppose
she
means
my
asking
her
to
be
my
wife
that
a
pretty
good
way
of
referring
to
it
anyhow
have
changed
my
mind
oh
has
she
about
what
it
did
strike
me
she
had
a
mind
to
change
thought
it
better
to
let
you
know
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
if
she
had
only
told
me
what
it
was
she
thought
it
better
to
let
me
know
it
would
have
been
perhaps
as
well
if
this
is
a
give
me
the
other
kind
of
thing
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
your
wife
what
what
the
blazes
does
she
mean
fact
is
i
am
going
to
marry
summers
instead
ely
jaw
dropped
and
he
stared
at
the
letter
as
though
it
were
a
ghost
well
i
hanged
the
fact
is
i
am
going
to
marry
summers
instead
that
takes
the
cake
yours
truly
lily
truscott
if
that
is
the
sweetest
thing
in
ever
yet
i
heard
of
quite
a
curious
change
had
come
over
ely
if
we
may
be
forgiven
a
vulgarism
which
is
most
expressive
he
seemed
to
have
been
knocked
all
of
a
heap
his
head
had
fallen
forward
on
his
chest
one
limp
hand
held
miss
truscott
letter
the
other
dangled
nerveless
by
his
side
and
i
gave
twenty
pounds
for
an
they
were
the
first
words
in
which
he
gave
expression
to
the
strength
of
his
emotion
good
lord
if
i
had
given
him
what
he
asked
and
stumped
up
the
reflection
sent
a
shudder
all
through
his
frame
the
horror
of
the
picture
thus
conjured
up
by
his
imagination
had
the
effect
of
a
tonic
on
his
nerves
it
recalled
him
to
himself
i
have
another
read
at
this
there
is
much
of
it
but
what
there
is
requires
a
good
deal
of
digesting
he
pulled
himself
together
sat
up
in
his
chair
and
had
another
read
ely
yes
by
george
dear
at
any
price
i
swear
like
her
impudence
to
call
me
i
wonder
she
did
begin
it
a
line
with
reference
to
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
that
is
i
think
about
the
coollest
bit
i
ever
heard
of
quite
a
casual
allusion
do
you
know
to
a
matter
of
not
the
slightest
importance
to
any
one
especially
me
that
young
woman
graduated
in
an
establishment
where
they
teach
how
to
go
have
changed
my
mind
that
that
about
two
stone
better
than
the
other
changed
her
mind
holy
moses
about
something
you
know
about
which
we
change
our
minds
as
easily
and
as
often
as
we
do
our
boots
thought
it
better
to
let
you
know
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
she
certainly
has
done
that
unless
she
had
changed
her
mind
before
she
had
made
it
up
she
could
scarcely
have
let
me
know
it
sooner
she
might
have
wired
to
be
sure
but
perhaps
she
never
thought
of
that
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
your
wife
it
is
as
well
that
the
explanation
follows
immediately
after
or
echo
would
have
answered
fact
is
i
am
going
to
marry
summers
instead
i
suppose
there
never
was
a
larger
amount
of
meaning
contained
in
a
smaller
number
of
words
among
the
remarkable
women
the
world
has
seen
the
record
hers
she
is
certainly
unique
rising
from
his
seat
he
put
the
letter
back
in
the
envelope
and
placed
the
envelope
within
his
i
take
that
letter
up
to
ash
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
him
i
wonder
if
he
knows
what
sort
of
a
ward
he
got
that
the
best
and
truest
girl
alive
a
woman
whose
word
is
just
her
bond
who
when
she
says
a
thing
sticks
to
it
like
glue
and
to
think
that
i
spent
twenty
pounds
on
an
he
put
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
he
balanced
himself
upon
his
toes
and
heels
twenty
pounds
for
an
i
wonder
how
much
summers
intends
to
pay
the
reflection
angered
him
by
george
i
let
her
know
if
she
going
to
pitch
me
overboard
quite
so
easily
as
that
i
make
her
marry
me
or
i
know
the
reason
why
when
he
left
for
the
city
his
first
business
was
to
pay
a
visit
to
ash
he
dismissed
the
cab
at
the
corner
of
throgmorton
street
he
had
not
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
along
that
rather
narrow
thoroughfare
when
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
turning
he
saw
rosenbaum
my
good
friend
i
have
a
little
paper
here
for
you
and
rosenbaum
deftly
slipped
a
paper
into
his
good
friend
hand
rosenbaum
what
this
it
a
writ
my
friend
a
writ
you
would
not
tell
me
the
name
of
your
solicitor
so
i
try
personal
service
instead
with
a
beaming
smile
and
a
nod
of
his
head
rosenbaum
swaggered
away
in
a
somewhat
bewildered
state
of
mind
ely
stared
after
him
the
paper
in
his
hand
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
here
two
strokes
of
luck
in
a
single
day
and
i
only
just
got
out
of
bed
he
opened
the
document
with
which
he
had
been
so
unexpectedly
presented
by
his
generous
friend
and
glanced
at
its
contents
it
was
headed
rosenbaum
ely
and
so
far
as
he
could
judge
from
his
hasty
glance
it
purported
to
relate
to
an
action
brought
by
ruth
rosenbaum
against
frederic
ely
to
recover
damages
for
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
well
this
is
a
pretty
go
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
the
damages
were
laid
at
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
he
had
already
spent
twenty
pounds
for
an
his
first
impulse
was
to
tear
the
paper
up
and
scatter
the
pieces
in
the
street
his
second
which
he
followed
was
to
place
it
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
as
a
companion
to
his
rosenbaum
must
be
a
greater
fool
even
than
i
thought
thirty
thousand
pounds
by
george
one
girl
values
me
at
a
considerably
higher
figure
than
another
does
he
found
that
ash
was
still
in
his
office
and
alone
so
without
troubling
to
have
himself
announced
he
marched
straight
in
hallo
ely
here
again
anything
settled
about
the
date
or
is
it
something
more
tangible
than
love
ash
was
engaged
with
a
file
of
correspondence
from
which
he
looked
up
at
ely
with
a
laugh
i
have
to
get
through
all
this
before
i
can
put
in
an
appearance
in
the
house
and
here
a
man
who
gives
me
so
many
minute
directions
about
what
he
wants
to
do
that
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
understand
what
it
is
he
wants
why
people
ca
just
say
this
that
is
more
than
i
can
tell
but
what
the
matter
you
look
quite
glum
so
would
you
look
glum
if
you
had
as
much
cause
for
looking
glum
as
me
i
do
know
you
won
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
england
and
one
of
the
nicest
little
fortunes
too
after
that
it
would
take
something
to
make
me
look
glum
she
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
england
there
no
mistake
about
that
any
man
might
be
proud
of
such
a
prize
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
night
i
been
thinking
about
it
too
and
the
result
is
to
give
you
that
dyspeptic
look
not
flattering
to
her
eh
there
was
a
pause
before
ely
answered
with
much
deliberation
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
his
i
sorry
you
do
think
it
flattering
another
pause
before
he
spoke
again
then
it
was
with
an
even
more
acidulated
expression
of
countenance
i
have
received
a
letter
by
this
morning
post
no
from
her
she
going
it
yes
she
is
going
it
i
think
that
sort
of
thing
hardly
your
line
eh
that
sort
of
thing
hardly
is
my
line
do
care
for
as
a
rule
i
should
like
to
refer
to
a
dictionary
to
know
what
a
is
if
this
is
a
i
prefer
a
summons
it
was
on
his
tongue
to
say
a
writ
but
he
remembered
that
he
already
had
one
in
his
pocket
and
chose
another
word
ah
ely
you
must
remember
that
this
is
a
romantic
girl
if
her
language
seems
too
flowery
too
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
romantic
girls
affection
is
apt
to
take
such
shapes
besides
i
should
think
you
rather
have
that
than
the
other
kind
of
thing
i
know
i
would
perhaps
before
you
pass
an
opinion
on
that
subject
you
allow
me
to
read
to
you
the
letter
i
received
read
it
i
say
is
that
quite
fair
men
do
read
their
even
to
their
young
women
guardians
as
a
rule
especially
the
first
i
thought
that
was
sacred
above
the
rest
look
here
ash
i
the
man
alive
but
you
never
came
nearer
having
an
inkstand
at
your
head
than
since
i
been
inside
this
room
ely
good
gracious
man
what
the
matter
now
i
repeat
perhaps
you
allow
me
to
read
to
you
the
letter
received
with
the
same
air
of
excessive
deliberation
ely
opened
his
took
from
it
an
envelope
and
from
it
a
letter
unfolded
the
epistle
and
looked
at
ash
ash
did
nothing
but
stare
at
him
this
is
my
first
the
one
which
you
thought
was
sacred
above
the
rest
i
do
know
about
the
rest
this
is
quite
enough
for
me
you
are
sure
you
listening
i
take
my
oath
on
that
ely
you
observe
how
warmly
she
begins
kind
of
way
you
know
a
line
with
reference
to
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
that
a
gentle
allusion
to
the
trivial
fact
that
on
the
day
before
she
pledged
herself
to
be
my
wife
we
getting
warm
you
see
have
changed
my
mind
she
has
what
she
says
that
she
has
changed
her
mind
what
does
she
mean
by
she
changed
her
mind
ah
that
what
we
have
to
see
it
an
obscure
allusion
which
becomes
clearer
later
on
an
example
of
the
flowery
language
in
which
romantic
girls
indulge
thought
it
better
to
let
you
know
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
you
observe
that
she
wastes
no
time
perhaps
that
another
characteristic
of
the
romantic
state
of
mind
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
your
wife
what
that
she
says
that
it
quite
impossible
for
her
to
be
my
wife
but
good
heavens
i
thought
you
told
me
she
said
yes
she
did
say
yes
but
an
unhesitating
a
final
and
decisive
yes
it
was
an
unhesitating
a
final
and
decisive
yes
you
sent
me
up
a
wire
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
i
should
send
you
up
a
wire
you
talked
about
having
the
marriage
in
a
month
i
did
talk
about
having
the
marriage
in
a
month
and
buying
a
house
and
furniture
and
all
the
rest
of
it
precisely
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
you
told
me
that
you
had
bought
a
ring
that
a
fact
i
did
i
paid
twenty
pounds
for
an
it
in
my
pocket
now
that
one
of
the
pleasantest
parts
of
the
affair
then
what
the
dickens
does
she
mean
is
the
girl
stark
mad
are
you
sure
the
letter
comes
from
her
you
shall
examine
it
for
yourself
in
a
moment
and
then
you
be
able
to
decide
you
understand
it
is
the
first
i
ever
had
and
therefore
sacred
above
the
rest
as
for
what
she
means
the
explanation
comes
a
little
further
on
in
the
next
sentence
in
fact
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
proceed
oh
go
on
it
is
plain
the
girl
is
mad
fact
is
i
am
going
to
marry
summers
instead
good
what
what
that
she
says
that
she
going
to
marry
summers
instead
instead
instead
of
whom
instead
of
me
well
i
hanged
yes
that
exactly
what
i
am
and
as
this
is
the
result
of
my
first
i
do
want
to
have
a
second
experience
of
the
same
kind
you
understand
then
he
done
it
after
all
what
a
fool
i
been
well
it
does
seem
that
there
a
fool
somewhere
in
the
case
i
done
it
all
the
deuce
you
have
do
you
know
this
man
summers
of
course
i
do
did
you
see
i
did
when
i
met
him
here
the
other
day
do
you
know
what
he
came
for
then
how
should
i
for
half
a
crown
i
should
be
surprised
he
one
of
those
painter
fellows
who
run
up
pictures
by
the
yard
he
came
for
lily
what
the
dickens
do
you
mean
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
he
came
to
ask
my
consent
to
make
my
ward
an
offer
of
his
hand
what
before
i
did
no
directly
you
had
gone
but
you
had
given
your
consent
to
me
i
told
him
so
he
did
seem
to
think
that
it
mattered
in
the
least
well
he
a
cool
hand
upon
my
sam
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
arranged
with
you
he
wanted
to
start
off
for
shanklin
there
and
then
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
got
him
to
listen
to
common
sense
i
never
saw
a
man
in
such
a
state
of
imbecility
finally
i
agreed
that
if
you
failed
then
he
should
have
his
chance
but
i
did
fail
well
it
looks
queer
looks
queer
do
you
want
to
drive
me
mad
and
i
paid
twenty
pounds
for
my
do
you
think
i
should
buy
if
i
was
sure
that
it
was
clear
a
girl
promises
to
be
my
wife
and
another
man
comes
directly
after
and
eggs
her
on
to
break
her
word
looks
queer
i
should
think
it
does
by
george
look
here
ash
if
you
think
i
going
to
sit
down
quietly
and
stand
this
sort
of
thing
you
wrong
shall
i
tell
you
what
my
own
opinion
of
the
matter
is
get
it
out
the
girl
a
fool
she
either
that
or
something
worse
i
have
only
to
go
down
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
her
quietly
and
you
see
it
will
be
all
right
you
go
down
and
where
do
you
suppose
that
i
shall
be
you
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
and
you
find
that
i
will
make
it
all
right
i
be
shot
if
i
will
the
girl
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
and
if
there
any
man
who
got
a
right
to
talk
to
her
it
me
i
had
one
day
out
of
town
i
think
i
spare
myself
another
you
got
a
have
you
when
is
there
a
train
producing
a
bradshaw
ash
plunged
into
its
intricacies
it
now
eleven
there
a
train
leaves
waterloo
eleven
reaches
shanklin
three
it
too
late
for
that
eleven
is
it
too
late
we
see
you
do
seem
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
at
this
moment
for
all
i
know
that
amusing
himself
with
the
woman
who
promised
to
be
my
wife
it
occur
to
you
that
there
is
any
necessity
for
haste
i
off
you
may
come
or
stay
just
as
you
please
i
come
it
a
little
awkward
but
i
come
it
is
awkward
you
think
it
awkward
if
you
were
in
the
pair
of
shoes
that
i
wearing
now
half
a
minute
just
let
me
speak
one
word
to
my
managing
man
ash
called
in
his
clerk
ely
passed
into
the
street
and
engaged
a
hansom
cab
in
a
remarkably
short
space
of
time
he
was
joined
by
ash
ely
gave
instructions
to
the
cabman
waterloo
main
line
and
go
like
blazes
and
the
cab
was
off
chapter
xi
an
encounter
in
the
train
ely
last
journey
from
shanklin
up
to
town
had
not
been
exactly
of
a
cheerful
kind
rosenbaum
appearance
on
the
scene
had
put
a
damper
on
to
that
the
tale
of
the
six
daughters
had
banished
peace
from
the
successful
wooer
mind
the
journey
from
town
to
shanklin
was
not
exactly
pleasant
either
under
the
best
of
circumstances
ely
was
not
the
most
cheerful
of
companions
under
existing
circumstances
he
was
the
most
cheerless
man
alive
he
showed
his
mettle
at
the
start
smoking
ash
suggested
to
the
guard
ely
pulled
up
short
not
for
me
what
do
you
mean
no
smoking
carriage
for
me
i
got
enough
on
my
hands
already
without
having
to
disinfect
myself
immediately
i
arrive
so
they
were
shown
into
a
compartment
ash
wished
his
friend
at
jericho
the
idea
of
a
journey
to
portsmouth
without
the
aid
of
a
cigar
did
not
commend
itself
to
him
besides
he
knew
that
miss
truscott
had
notions
on
the
subject
of
tobacco
but
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
refrain
from
treading
on
the
tail
of
the
coat
which
ely
was
obviously
trailing
on
the
ground
and
he
had
his
revenge
just
as
the
train
was
actually
starting
there
was
a
cry
of
stop
some
one
came
rushing
down
the
platform
the
door
was
opened
and
first
a
lady
and
then
a
gentleman
were
assisted
in
that
was
a
narrow
squeak
exclaimed
the
gentleman
then
he
turned
laughing
to
the
lady
that
a
nice
beginning
mrs
b
the
lady
laughed
at
him
again
it
a
matter
of
no
importance
but
i
suppose
all
our
luggage
is
left
behind
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
no
they
putting
it
in
in
such
a
style
what
a
scene
of
ruin
will
greet
our
eyes
when
we
reach
the
other
end
he
drew
his
head
into
the
compartment
and
took
a
survey
of
his
surroundings
what
ash
what
ely
here
a
go
what
brings
you
two
thieves
in
here
quite
a
happy
family
my
boys
the
gentleman
extended
one
hand
to
ash
and
the
other
to
ely
ash
laughingly
grasped
the
one
which
came
his
way
ely
acidly
declined
the
other
but
the
gentleman
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
cast
down
he
gave
ely
a
resounding
thwack
upon
the
shoulder
which
doubled
him
up
as
though
he
were
some
lay
figure
ely
my
boy
you
look
as
though
you
had
been
living
on
sour
apples
for
a
week
what
the
matter
with
him
ash
been
induced
to
lend
his
aged
mother
half
a
crown
he
never
get
over
it
you
know
bailey
gasped
ely
i
trouble
you
not
to
play
your
practical
jokes
on
me
bailey
laughed
behind
the
cover
of
his
paper
ash
laughed
too
bailey
better
known
as
jack
bailey
was
also
a
member
of
the
house
and
as
such
known
both
to
ely
and
to
ash
one
of
those
hearty
healthy
englishmen
who
having
not
the
slightest
reserve
themselves
have
no
notion
of
the
existence
of
such
a
sense
in
anybody
else
he
was
ely
particular
abhorrence
when
bailey
had
done
laughing
he
turned
to
the
lady
who
accompanied
him
she
was
a
feminine
repetition
of
himself
a
tall
strapping
buxom
wench
with
bright
black
eyes
and
bright
red
cheeks
the
very
embodiment
of
health
and
strength
the
sort
of
damsel
who
is
in
her
element
on
the
or
on
the
river
or
doing
dances
off
the
reel
who
do
you
think
that
is
the
lady
laughed
jack
shut
up
she
said
just
hark
at
her
we
not
been
married
an
hour
and
she
beginning
to
order
me
about
already
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
wife
bailey
miss
williamson
that
was
married
this
morning
in
the
church
of
michael
and
all
angels
six
bridesmaids
and
such
a
only
we
could
stop
to
eat
this
we
had
to
catch
the
train
and
bailey
laughed
again
ash
laughed
too
but
ely
he
turned
green
ash
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
to
the
lady
allow
me
to
offer
you
my
congratulations
bailey
am
i
justified
in
supposing
that
you
are
starting
on
your
honeymoon
justified
i
should
think
you
are
seating
himself
bailey
slipped
his
arm
about
the
lady
waist
i
say
bess
it
lucky
fallen
among
men
i
know
i
should
have
had
to
apologise
for
kissing
you
in
front
of
strangers
he
kissed
her
then
but
the
lady
only
laughed
you
know
jack
she
explained
every
one
knows
jack
he
has
a
way
of
his
own
i
should
think
i
have
got
a
way
of
my
own
cried
the
gentleman
referred
to
and
he
slipped
the
lady
on
to
his
knee
i
would
give
a
button
for
the
man
who
had
eh
ely
what
do
you
say
i
say
ely
why
do
you
go
in
for
something
in
this
line
and
he
nodded
towards
his
wife
i
afraid
i
do
not
understand
you
he
says
he
does
understand
me
bess
is
that
a
funny
man
are
you
not
married
mr
ely
inquired
the
bride
of
an
hour
i
have
not
that
happiness
for
the
life
of
him
ash
could
not
have
resisted
the
chance
which
offered
but
he
going
to
be
he
engaged
he
said
ely
turned
the
colour
of
a
boiled
beetroot
but
and
bailey
quite
mistook
the
reason
it
was
not
because
he
was
shy
it
was
because
the
exigencies
of
civilisation
debarred
him
from
cutting
ash
throat
i
wish
you
joy
exclaimed
the
gentleman
when
it
going
to
be
chimed
in
the
lady
i
be
best
man
if
you
promise
to
send
me
a
piece
of
the
cake
i
let
you
have
a
piece
of
mine
bailey
turned
to
his
wife
to
look
at
him
you
would
think
he
was
engaged
now
would
you
why
is
there
anything
funny
about
the
looks
of
a
man
when
engaged
funny
i
should
think
there
is
ely
what
do
you
think
do
you
feel
funny
you
ought
to
if
you
do
may
i
inquire
bailey
what
you
mean
there
was
such
a
savage
tone
in
ely
voice
that
even
the
not
bailey
was
struck
by
it
hallo
what
up
now
i
say
ash
you
ought
to
tip
a
fellow
the
wink
when
a
man
had
an
unfortunate
misunderstanding
with
his
best
girl
bailey
i
beg
bailey
pardon
but
i
suppose
that
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
you
take
it
for
granted
that
you
may
permit
yourself
the
utmost
license
of
speech
bailey
whistled
bailey
laughed
then
looked
out
of
the
window
with
a
look
of
innocent
surprise
that
look
of
innocent
surprise
which
means
so
much
bailey
nudged
his
wife
with
his
elbow
beautiful
scenery
is
it
they
were
then
passing
a
long
level
stretch
of
what
seemed
bailey
laughed
again
ah
it
a
serious
thing
to
have
a
misunderstanding
with
your
best
girl
bailey
laughed
again
it
all
very
well
to
laugh
but
i
had
more
than
one
and
nobody
knows
what
it
feels
like
who
has
gone
through
it
all
poor
chap
no
wonder
he
feels
down
ely
explained
the
lady
never
you
mind
jack
it
a
way
got
he
will
always
have
his
joke
then
she
showed
the
tact
for
which
women
are
so
famous
i
hope
that
there
really
has
been
no
misunderstanding
with
with
the
lady
s
sh
bess
for
shame
i
surprised
at
you
i
would
have
asked
such
a
question
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
bailey
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
feel
quite
convinced
that
you
will
be
able
to
provide
bailey
with
an
excellent
establishment
by
becoming
a
professional
buffoon
this
was
ely
final
word
the
train
just
then
drew
up
at
guildford
bailey
rose
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
i
afraid
my
dear
bess
we
must
really
tear
ourselves
away
we
ought
to
find
a
separate
compartment
our
friends
are
most
anxious
to
smoke
and
the
presence
of
a
lady
prevents
them
you
know
when
the
pair
were
gone
ely
turned
upon
ash
with
something
that
was
very
much
like
a
snarl
i
have
to
thank
you
for
that
for
what
what
do
you
mean
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
for
that
clown
impertinence
great
lumbering
buffoon
good
gracious
ely
you
do
seem
to
be
in
the
pleasantest
of
moods
what
did
i
tell
him
i
only
said
you
were
engaged
what
harm
is
there
in
that
i
do
know
what
good
you
expect
to
come
from
keeping
it
hidden
from
the
world
ely
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
he
gnashed
his
teeth
not
figuratively
but
very
literally
indeed
by
george
i
make
her
marry
me
or
i
know
the
reason
why
one
way
to
that
desirable
consummation
is
to
compromise
the
name
advertise
the
fact
that
she
has
promised
to
be
your
wife
if
i
thought
that
i
stick
it
up
on
every
dead
wall
in
town
let
try
milder
means
at
first
leave
more
vigorous
measures
to
a
little
later
on
unless
i
much
mistaken
you
find
the
milder
means
will
serve
there
a
little
misunderstanding
that
is
all
little
misunderstanding
you
call
it
do
you
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
call
a
big
one
then
if
they
did
not
actually
come
to
blows
they
did
more
than
one
little
bit
of
figurative
sparring
on
the
way
ash
found
it
best
to
keep
quite
still
directly
he
opened
his
mouth
ely
showed
an
amazing
disposition
to
snap
at
his
nose
for
instance
once
when
the
train
stopped
at
a
station
this
is
rowland
castle
is
it
no
it
is
rowland
castle
i
should
like
to
know
what
on
earth
makes
you
think
it
rowland
castle
i
wonder
you
do
say
colney
hatch
ash
gazed
mildly
at
his
friend
and
subsided
into
his
paper
he
felt
that
with
things
as
they
were
conversation
might
be
labelled
dangerous
chapter
xii
the
rivals
new
version
when
they
reached
shanklin
ely
was
shown
into
the
while
ash
disappeared
upstairs
you
wait
in
there
suggested
ash
there
a
word
or
two
i
want
to
say
to
the
old
lady
i
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
thing
because
it
quite
possible
we
come
on
a
wild
goose
chase
after
all
you
wait
half
a
minute
and
i
see
miss
lily
sent
to
you
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
to
see
her
come
flying
headlong
into
your
arms
then
you
find
out
that
it
almost
worth
while
to
fall
out
for
the
sake
of
the
reconciliation
left
alone
in
the
ely
was
not
by
any
means
so
sure
he
was
inclined
to
be
sceptical
as
to
the
young
lady
flying
leap
into
his
arms
and
as
to
falling
out
for
the
sake
of
the
reconciliation
well
there
might
be
something
perhaps
in
that
but
he
would
like
to
have
felt
as
sure
about
the
reconciliation
as
he
did
about
the
falling
out
he
seated
himself
on
an
ottoman
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
stared
at
his
patent
toes
a
minute
passed
more
than
a
minute
more
than
five
minutes
indeed
still
he
was
left
alone
he
looked
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
since
he
entered
the
room
this
is
a
pretty
state
of
things
ten
living
minutes
have
i
sat
stewing
here
and
ash
said
that
in
less
than
half
a
minute
he
be
surprised
to
see
her
in
my
arms
it
looks
like
it
he
got
up
and
surveyed
the
apartment
i
wonder
where
she
is
and
where
the
other
fellow
is
that
the
man
to
whom
i
ought
to
apply
for
information
i
lay
my
hat
that
she
done
some
bounding
into
his
arms
since
yesterday
that
a
pleasant
thought
to
think
about
the
woman
who
promised
to
be
your
wife
ely
disconsolately
paced
the
room
and
to
think
that
i
paid
twenty
pounds
for
an
and
i
might
have
forked
up
that
what
gets
at
me
and
i
got
rosenbaum
writ
in
my
coat
pocket
damages
laid
at
thirty
thousand
pounds
oh
lor
this
is
a
nice
day
work
i
done
pausing
before
the
fireplace
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
mantelshelf
and
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
groaned
excuse
me
but
can
you
tell
me
where
miss
truscott
is
there
was
a
voice
behind
him
ely
turned
hallo
ely
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
you
how
are
you
dear
old
man
ely
turned
metaphorically
into
a
pillar
of
ice
into
a
pillar
of
ice
if
we
may
confound
our
metaphors
for
while
his
exterior
demeanour
was
several
degrees
below
zero
his
interior
economy
left
boiling
point
at
the
post
a
gentleman
had
strolled
into
the
room
through
the
opened
window
william
summers
william
summers
as
large
as
life
and
larger
there
were
no
signs
of
guilt
upon
his
countenance
certainly
there
were
none
in
his
bearing
he
held
a
soft
crush
hat
in
one
hand
the
other
he
held
out
to
ely
well
i
hanged
i
say
ely
what
the
row
speechless
with
indignation
ely
turned
and
strode
towards
the
door
when
he
reached
it
he
paused
and
turning
again
he
gazed
at
the
intruder
the
intruder
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
abashed
that
the
way
they
used
to
do
it
at
the
coburg
exit
vanquished
vice
sir
that
a
little
coburg
too
they
used
to
roll
their
r
summers
tugged
at
his
beard
retracing
his
steps
ely
strode
on
until
he
was
in
a
measurable
distance
of
summers
nose
understand
this
once
for
all
you
are
a
perfect
stranger
sir
to
me
that
all
right
i
thought
i
was
excuse
one
stranger
speaking
to
another
but
could
you
tell
me
where
miss
truscott
is
ely
gasped
this
this
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
of
mr
summers
that
right
ely
i
awake
wire
in
and
lay
me
flat
i
mind
a
bit
in
all
this
there
may
be
something
funny
sir
which
commends
it
to
your
mind
if
you
have
a
mind
but
i
see
nothing
comic
in
desecrating
nature
most
sacred
ties
and
in
corrupting
the
innocence
of
youth
more
do
i
ely
not
the
way
you
put
it
and
i
could
put
it
better
if
i
tried
are
you
aware
that
miss
truscott
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
ah
that
was
a
mistake
a
mistake
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
you
see
ely
i
been
in
love
with
her
a
good
twelve
months
aye
that
and
more
i
fell
in
love
with
her
the
first
moment
she
came
across
my
path
what
the
dickens
do
i
care
if
you
been
in
love
with
her
twelve
years
more
shame
you
do
you
consider
that
a
justification
to
the
scoundrel
who
betrays
another
fellow
wife
in
love
with
her
in
a
sense
you
do
not
understand
in
love
with
her
with
my
whole
life
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
me
i
have
lived
for
her
and
worked
and
hoped
and
dreamed
until
she
has
grown
to
be
the
centre
of
my
being
does
she
mean
all
that
to
you
what
business
have
you
to
ask
me
such
a
question
when
you
have
ruined
jones
do
you
put
a
similar
inquiry
to
jones
i
should
think
jones
would
feel
that
you
were
a
logical
sort
of
person
if
you
did
ah
but
here
she
is
not
your
wife
but
she
going
to
be
as
i
live
she
never
will
hang
it
sir
do
i
tell
you
that
she
promised
and
do
i
tell
you
that
was
a
mistake
if
you
will
keep
cool
i
will
give
you
an
explanation
if
you
decline
to
listen
to
an
explanation
you
must
be
content
to
realise
the
fact
look
here
summers
you
are
a
sort
of
man
with
whom
i
have
had
very
little
to
do
my
misfortune
not
your
fault
but
i
suppose
you
have
some
idea
of
common
decency
if
you
have
none
of
honour
i
hope
i
have
and
i
ask
you
if
you
think
it
decent
directly
a
woman
has
promised
a
man
to
be
his
wife
to
go
behind
his
back
and
induce
the
woman
to
dishonour
herself
and
him
but
that
is
not
what
i
have
done
it
is
what
you
have
done
one
day
miss
truscott
promises
to
be
my
wife
the
next
directly
my
back
is
turned
you
come
and
persuade
her
to
be
false
to
herself
and
me
my
good
ely
there
is
one
factor
you
are
omitting
from
your
calculations
and
that
is
love
which
with
you
stands
higher
love
or
honesty
oh
they
both
go
would
it
have
been
honest
for
her
to
have
married
you
when
she
loved
me
pooh
stuff
and
nonsense
i
never
heard
such
impudence
what
the
dickens
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
the
woman
who
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
loves
you
you
perceive
it
is
from
that
that
i
saved
you
that
curse
of
all
existence
that
canker
which
eats
into
the
very
root
of
life
a
loveless
marriage
but
there
are
not
many
signs
of
gratitude
that
i
can
see
and
summers
sighed
ely
gasped
look
here
summers
i
am
not
a
fighting
man
no
but
if
i
were
yes
if
you
were
go
on
by
george
sir
if
i
were
at
this
moment
ash
entered
the
room
i
sorry
ash
that
you
have
come
you
interrupted
the
most
agreeable
interview
that
i
ever
had
in
all
my
life
i
surprised
summers
after
what
has
passed
to
see
you
here
why
i
assure
you
i
not
at
all
surprised
at
seeing
you
rising
summers
held
out
his
hand
but
ash
declined
to
see
it
oh
take
his
hand
for
goodness
sake
take
his
hand
shake
it
off
his
wrist
do
let
him
suppose
that
you
not
delighted
to
have
the
pleasure
our
friend
ely
your
friend
ely
what
the
dickens
sir
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
your
friend
very
red
in
the
face
ely
struck
an
attitude
in
front
of
summers
which
was
probably
intended
to
express
ferocity
summers
tugged
at
his
beard
and
smiled
ash
interposed
i
can
hardly
think
summers
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
suggest
that
your
presence
is
not
required
here
my
dear
fellow
i
am
only
waiting
to
obtain
a
little
information
what
information
can
you
possibly
expect
to
receive
i
only
want
to
know
where
miss
truscott
is
yes
that
all
that
all
he
wants
to
know
a
more
modest
request
i
never
heard
he
only
wants
to
know
where
my
wife
is
excuse
me
ely
but
miss
truscott
is
not
your
wife
but
she
going
to
be
that
she
will
never
be
hang
it
sir
ely
rushed
forward
but
again
ash
thought
it
advisable
to
interpose
summers
be
so
kind
as
to
leave
this
house
oh
do
turn
him
out
for
goodness
sake
do
turn
him
out
pray
tell
him
where
the
lady
is
and
also
acquaint
him
with
the
situation
of
the
spoons
and
entreat
him
next
time
he
calls
to
bring
his
burglar
friends
and
other
relatives
ash
endeavoured
to
pacify
his
friend
but
the
attempt
was
vain
ely
blood
was
up
his
wrongs
were
more
than
he
could
bear
my
dear
ely
i
beg
that
you
will
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
this
gentleman
attention
not
me
i
not
paying
the
attention
it
he
and
to
my
young
woman
by
the
lord
still
tugging
at
his
beard
summers
laughed
and
turned
away
i
sorry
you
can
not
give
me
the
information
i
require
and
you
really
are
inhospitable
ash
you
really
are
but
never
mind
have
my
revenge
when
you
come
to
see
me
i
not
show
you
the
door
nor
ely
if
he
condescend
to
call
he
had
reached
the
window
when
the
door
opened
and
clive
appeared
ah
here
is
clive
i
am
sure
that
clive
will
take
pity
on
a
man
especially
a
man
in
the
forlorn
situation
which
i
am
may
i
ask
if
you
can
tell
me
where
i
am
likely
to
find
miss
truscott
mr
summers
clive
attitude
was
a
study
it
was
as
though
all
the
pokers
in
england
were
down
her
back
but
summers
did
not
show
any
sign
of
discomposure
surely
you
will
not
be
hard
upon
a
man
especially
upon
a
man
in
love
consider
our
position
i
seek
lily
she
seeks
me
is
short
you
would
not
have
us
waste
its
sweetness
summers
i
am
more
amazed
than
i
can
say
oh
do
be
amazed
for
goodness
sake
do
be
amazed
and
do
be
hard
upon
a
man
especially
upon
a
man
in
love
consider
his
position
and
do
waste
the
sweetness
of
life
oh
do
for
gracious
sake
ely
pulled
up
his
and
shot
his
cuffs
i
reckon
i
spending
one
of
the
pleasantest
half
hours
i
ever
had
in
all
my
life
clive
will
you
not
listen
to
the
voice
the
voice
of
love
summers
i
must
decline
to
listen
to
another
word
and
i
am
amazed
to
think
that
you
should
attempt
to
address
me
at
all
especially
as
i
have
given
you
to
understand
that
our
acquaintance
sir
had
ceased
ceased
and
i
am
going
to
marry
your
niece
could
you
so
divide
the
family
she
who
loves
you
so
and
whom
for
her
sweet
sake
and
pompey
i
love
too
well
this
this
does
beat
that
allusion
to
pompey
was
one
of
the
most
touching
things
i
heard
and
he
is
going
to
marry
your
niece
so
you
and
i
ash
had
better
go
back
to
town
and
again
ely
collar
and
cuffs
came
into
play
ash
advanced
summers
i
have
already
requested
you
to
go
you
can
scarcely
wish
us
to
use
force
no
not
force
not
that
if
it
must
be
then
goodbye
after
all
parting
is
such
sweet
sorrow
goodbye
clive
you
will
weep
for
me
when
i
am
gone
ely
we
shall
meet
at
philippi
i
leave
you
yes
you
three
perchance
to
wrangle
in
very
truth
thinking
angry
thoughts
in
such
an
air
of
discord
too
while
i
i
go
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
where
love
lies
dreaming
and
waiting
perhaps
for
me
if
i
meet
miss
truscott
ely
and
i
shall
under
the
trysting
tree
i
will
tell
her
that
if
you
had
been
a
fighting
man
you
certainly
would
have
murdered
me
chapter

the
lover
greets
the
lady
there
was
a
pause
when
he
had
gone
clive
the
very
essence
of
dignified
disapprobation
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
ash
a
little
flustered
was
near
the
window
first
gazing
through
it
in
the
direction
which
summers
had
taken
and
then
a
little
dubiously
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
his
indignant
friend
ely
hands
were
in
his
trouser
pockets
his
legs
were
wide
apart
his
countenance
was
red
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
dissatisfied
frame
of
mind
indeed
it
was
he
who
broke
the
silence
you
see
ash
it
was
a
wild
goose
chase
we
came
upon
that
man
looks
like
it
by
george
my
dear
fellow
i
hope
you
will
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
what
that
person
says
he
is
the
kind
of
man
who
will
say
anything
i
assure
you
there
is
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
you
to
feel
concerned
from
ash
manner
it
almost
seemed
as
though
he
desired
to
convey
a
greater
feeling
of
assurance
that
he
quite
felt
himself
he
cast
several
glances
in
the
direction
of
clive
as
though
seeking
for
support
it
depends
upon
what
you
call
the
occasion
for
concern
retorted
ely
drily
when
a
man
tells
you
that
he
is
going
to
marry
the
girl
who
has
promised
to
be
your
wife
and
that
he
is
going
to
meet
her
underneath
the
trysting
tree
where
love
lies
dreaming
he
said
by
gad
some
people
would
think
that
there
was
some
reason
to
feel
concerned
ash
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
and
fidgeted
upon
his
feet
and
looked
at
clive
he
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
in
finding
something
suitable
to
say
but
clive
came
nobly
to
his
rescue
she
advanced
to
ely
with
a
smiling
countenance
and
an
outstretched
hand
good
afternoon
ely
you
have
not
spoken
to
me
yet
i
am
pleased
to
have
you
back
with
us
so
soon
ely
seemed
in
two
minds
at
first
as
to
whether
he
should
take
her
hand
then
he
just
touched
it
with
his
own
good
afternoon
if
you
pleased
i
sure
i
am
though
i
must
say
your
pleasure
easily
found
but
the
old
lady
was
not
to
be
so
easily
put
down
her
cue
seemed
to
be
to
assume
unconsciousness
of
there
being
anything
unpleasant
in
the
air
the
pleasure
of
your
visit
is
heightened
by
its
unexpectedness
lily
has
been
working
all
the
morning
in
her
room
upstairs
you
have
no
idea
how
industrious
she
is
ely
looked
at
her
suspiciously
as
though
he
doubted
if
she
were
a
strict
exponent
of
the
truth
i
thought
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
meet
her
underneath
the
trysting
tree
the
old
lady
smiled
a
superior
smile
you
really
must
not
believe
such
nonsense
as
that
i
assure
you
it
is
the
greatest
presumption
upon
his
part
it
would
require
a
good
deal
of
assurance
to
make
me
believe
that
it
was
not
lily
will
be
with
us
directly
young
ladies
can
not
rush
into
a
gentleman
presence
quite
at
a
moment
notice
you
know
i
beg
that
miss
truscott
will
take
her
time
ely
marched
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
stood
looking
in
rather
too
obvious
admiration
at
an
engraving
after
landseer
which
hung
upon
the
wall
clive
a
little
disconcerted
was
left
to
make
conversation
with
ash
but
ash
was
in
a
distinctly
uneasy
frame
of
mind
i
suppose
he
said
in
a
whisper
to
the
lady
keeping
one
eye
fixed
on
ely
all
the
time
i
suppose
she
come
my
dear
ash
what
do
you
mean
the
lady
modulated
tones
betrayed
the
most
intense
surprise
ash
coughed
his
manner
was
apologetic
but
without
volunteering
an
explanation
he
sauntered
off
towards
ely
he
had
hardly
taken
a
step
when
the
door
opened
and
miss
truscott
appeared
the
young
entrance
in
its
way
was
perfect
she
was
so
extremely
at
her
ease
she
stood
at
the
door
a
moment
and
then
advanced
with
outstretched
hands
and
the
sweetest
smile
to
ash
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
ely
he
on
his
part
continued
to
admire
the
engraving
guardian
how
kind
of
you
to
take
me
by
surprise
like
this
ash
took
the
two
hands
she
offered
and
looked
at
her
certainly
this
was
a
woman
whom
no
man
need
be
ashamed
to
call
his
wife
tall
above
the
average
of
her
sex
yet
her
figure
was
exquisitely
feminine
she
bore
herself
with
the
daintiest
grace
she
was
dressed
in
white
from
head
to
foot
a
silver
belt
went
round
her
waist
in
the
belt
were
some
red
roses
there
was
another
rosebud
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
as
ash
held
her
two
soft
white
hands
in
his
he
involuntarily
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
dapper
little
gentleman
who
was
continuing
to
examine
the
engraving
which
hung
upon
the
wall
even
if
they
made
a
match
of
it
they
would
scarcely
make
a
pair
these
two
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
asked
the
lady
seeing
that
he
was
still
do
you
know
how
long
it
is
since
you
came
to
look
upon
my
face
does
your
conscience
not
reproach
you
sir
i
suppose
it
is
the
juggernaut
of
commerce
which
has
kept
you
so
long
away
ash
smiled
and
pressed
her
hands
possibly
the
source
from
which
she
drew
the
reference
to
the
juggernaut
of
commerce
was
still
fresh
in
his
mind
for
there
was
something
a
little
uneasy
in
his
smile
i
think
you
will
allow
that
i
have
atoned
for
my
misconduct
when
you
perceive
whom
i
have
brought
as
my
companion
ash
motioned
towards
ely
with
his
now
disengaged
hand
miss
truscott
turned
with
her
most
innocent
air
when
she
perceived
the
little
gentleman
her
countenance
was
illumined
with
a
seraphic
smile
ely
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
this
is
a
compliment
to
be
able
to
tear
yourself
away
again
so
quickly
from
your
noras
and
doras
and
bulls
and
bears
ely
ceased
to
examine
the
engraving
turning
he
pulled
his
spotless
white
waistcoat
down
into
its
place
and
then
thrust
his
thumbs
into
the
armholes
he
looked
the
lady
in
the
face
i
knew
you
would
be
surprised
he
said
surprised
surprised
is
not
the
word
then
she
turned
again
to
ash
guardian
would
you
like
to
look
at
the
garden
you
have
no
idea
how
beautiful
it
is
ash
cleared
his
throat
he
felt
that
this
was
a
defiance
that
in
these
seemingly
innocent
words
the
gage
of
challenge
was
thrown
down
miss
truscott
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
not
come
down
to
look
at
the
garden
he
looked
at
ely
but
that
gentleman
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
faithless
fair
one
with
a
sort
of
glare
he
looked
at
clive
but
there
were
no
signs
that
help
was
likely
to
come
from
there
the
stockbroker
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
come
to
the
point
my
dear
lily
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
the
garden
delighted
by
and
by
this
interpolation
was
necessary
because
the
young
lady
sailed
towards
the
window
as
though
she
wished
to
fly
into
the
garden
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
before
i
can
give
myself
that
pleasure
there
is
one
little
point
which
i
should
like
to
have
cleared
up
miss
truscott
brought
to
a
standstill
looked
down
at
the
toe
of
the
little
shoe
with
which
she
was
tapping
the
floor
yes
guardian
what
is
that
nothing
could
be
better
in
its
way
than
the
air
of
shy
sweet
modesty
with
which
she
asked
the
question
but
ash
felt
that
it
was
a
little
disconcerting
all
the
same
it
eh
rather
a
delicate
point
for
an
old
and
crusty
bachelor
like
me
to
handle
ash
said
this
with
an
air
of
forced
joviality
which
was
anything
but
jovial
his
gruesome
effort
to
be
cheerful
seemed
to
strike
miss
truscott
for
she
gave
him
a
quick
penetrating
glance
which
took
him
considerably
aback
guardian
are
you
well
well
god
bless
the
girl
yes
what
do
you
mean
back
went
the
eyes
to
the
toe
which
again
began
tapping
the
floor
i
did
know
ash
pulled
himself
together
he
made
another
effort
and
began
again
he
was
not
a
man
who
was
deficient
in
tact
as
a
rule
but
he
was
conscious
that
his
was
a
position
in
which
even
something
more
than
tact
might
be
required
joining
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
balanced
himself
upon
his
toes
and
heels
assuming
what
he
intended
to
be
a
judicial
attitude
my
dear
lily
you
are
quite
aware
that
you
have
reached
an
age
at
which
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
treat
you
as
a
girl
would
you
treat
me
as
an
old
woman
then
this
was
disconcerting
even
more
disconcerting
was
the
glance
with
which
it
was
accompanied
ash
who
had
the
sense
of
humour
which
ely
lacked
was
quite
aware
that
the
young
lady
was
laughing
in
her
sleeve
and
he
had
very
clearly
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
previous
occasions
on
which
the
young
lady
had
beaten
him
with
weapons
against
which
none
of
his
were
of
the
least
avail
still
he
stuck
to
his
guns
was
not
ely
looking
on
and
clive
i
would
treat
you
as
a
person
who
has
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
who
is
conscious
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
which
she
may
use
one
moment
for
miss
truscott
murmured
something
about
her
not
being
yet
and
he
felt
that
interruption
might
be
fatal
lily
you
are
at
least
aware
of
what
a
promise
means
the
young
lady
sighed
it
depends
she
said
depends
depends
on
what
she
looked
up
feeling
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
preserve
his
gravity
and
yet
meet
the
wicked
light
which
he
knew
was
in
her
eyes
ash
glance
in
turn
sought
refuge
on
the
ground
supposing
she
explained
when
you
were
suffering
from
an
attack
of
indigestion
you
promised
a
friend
to
cut
your
throat
you
know
what
one
is
inclined
to
promise
when
one
does
feel
would
you
feel
constrained
to
carry
out
your
promise
when
you
found
that
a
dose
of
somebody
medicine
had
brought
you
round
ash
was
still
clive
took
up
the
parable
instead
lily
i
amazed
at
you
my
dear
aunt
why
are
you
amazed
i
never
thought
a
niece
of
mine
could
have
acted
so
miss
truscott
sighed
it
seems
to
me
that
of
late
i
always
doing
wrong
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
think
i
had
better
go
into
the
garden
all
alone
she
gave
a
towards
the
window
ash
cleared
his
throat
with
rather
a
suspicious
hem
it
wo
do
lily
i
know
your
genius
for
turning
serious
questions
upside
down
but
i
ask
you
to
put
it
to
your
conscience
if
on
the
present
occasion
that
is
fair
a
matter
which
affects
the
lives
of
a
man
and
of
a
woman
ought
to
be
approached
with
gravity
at
least
is
the
woman
me
she
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
ought
that
to
be
is
the
woman
i
then
she
broke
into
a
smile
what
can
you
expect
when
even
the
elementary
rules
of
grammar
are
not
there
so
far
ely
had
kept
a
judicious
if
not
a
judicial
silence
but
when
he
saw
that
miss
truscott
was
smiling
at
ash
and
more
than
suspected
that
ash
was
smiling
back
at
her
he
felt
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
speak
if
you
will
allow
me
ash
i
manage
this
myself
delighted
my
dear
fellow
i
am
sure
i
fancy
i
am
the
person
principally
concerned
quite
so
quite
so
if
you
will
leave
me
alone
with
miss
truscott
i
no
doubt
that
in
a
few
minutes
we
shall
understand
each
other
very
well
indeed
i
sure
you
will
i
feel
quite
sure
you
will
ash
tone
was
cheerful
ely
felt
that
it
was
even
exasperatingly
cheerful
advancing
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
mind
you
behave
yourself
he
told
her
then
he
left
the
room
lily
said
clive
when
ash
had
gone
i
trust
you
will
do
credit
to
the
precepts
which
i
have
so
constantly
and
i
hope
conscientiously
endeavoured
to
instil
into
your
mind
and
that
i
shall
not
have
cause
to
blush
for
my
own
sister
child
then
clive
went
after
ash
and
the
two
were
left
alone
chapter
xiv
the
lady
endeavours
to
explain
sounds
like
the
last
words
of
a
funeral
sermon
muttered
ely
directly
the
door
was
closed
it
does
sound
a
little
that
way
does
it
then
the
two
were
still
ely
took
up
the
position
in
front
of
the
fireplace
which
had
been
occupied
by
ash
miss
truscott
seated
herself
by
a
and
pensively
regarded
so
much
of
her
toes
as
she
permitted
to
peep
from
under
the
hem
of
her
dress
a
considerable
pause
ensued
possibly
ely
was
endeavouring
to
find
words
with
which
to
clothe
his
thoughts
this
is
like
a
quaker
meeting
murmured
the
lady
ely
started
but
he
checked
the
retort
which
rose
to
his
lips
and
continued
his
reflections
at
last
he
spoke
the
words
issued
from
his
lips
with
excessive
deliberation
as
though
he
weighed
each
one
to
be
quite
sure
it
was
of
proper
weight
miss
truscott
the
exigencies
of
modern
civilisation
compel
from
man
a
chivalrous
attitude
towards
the
weaker
sex
she
looked
up
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
and
he
immediately
wished
she
would
look
down
again
but
there
are
occasions
on
which
chivalry
should
give
place
to
even
higher
things
he
certainly
wished
she
would
look
down
again
her
countenance
was
perfectly
grave
but
he
had
a
horrid
suspicion
that
there
was
laughter
in
her
eyes
she
murmured
something
to
herself
what
was
that
you
said
he
asked
with
a
sudden
departure
from
his
air
of
ceremonious
state
nothing
she
looked
down
and
smiled
ely
felt
that
he
was
growing
warm
he
was
not
a
man
easily
put
out
of
countenance
as
a
rule
but
this
young
lady
had
an
effect
upon
him
which
was
quite
unprecedented
he
changed
his
method
of
attack
and
from
excessive
deliberation
passed
to
excessive
haste
miss
truscott
i
am
a
plain
business
man
you
are
the
day
before
yesterday
i
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
you
did
you
said
you
would
and
immediately
afterwards
i
changed
my
mind
she
said
this
with
her
sweetest
smile
changed
your
mind
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
i
spent
twenty
pounds
on
an
ely
produced
a
little
leather
case
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
from
the
case
a
ring
do
you
see
that
do
you
know
i
paid
twenty
pounds
for
that
and
it
might
have
cost
me
taking
the
ring
miss
truscott
slipped
it
on
her
long
slender
finger
what
a
pretty
ring
how
well
it
fits
me
too
i
buy
it
from
you
if
you
let
me
have
it
cheap
ely
was
for
a
moment
speechless
cheap
do
you
think
i
buy
to
sell
them
at
a
profit
then
i
do
know
you
say
you
are
a
business
man
say
i
a
business
man
i
should
have
to
be
a
very
funny
business
man
if
i
did
that
kind
of
thing
taking
off
the
ring
miss
truscott
put
it
back
into
the
case
never
mind
ely
as
a
business
man
you
know
that
a
good
investment
is
never
thrown
away
if
you
do
meet
with
a
good
offer
for
it
at
once
it
is
sure
to
come
in
by
and
by
if
you
go
on
asking
girls
to
marry
you
possibly
in
time
you
will
light
on
one
who
will
not
change
her
mind
miss
truscott
i
do
think
you
quite
know
what
sort
of
man
i
am
you
say
you
are
a
business
man
but
excuse
me
you
do
seem
to
know
what
a
business
man
is
either
a
business
man
is
a
man
who
sticks
to
his
own
bargains
and
expects
other
people
to
stick
to
theirs
is
he
indeed
how
very
interesting
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
always
supposing
that
i
did
not
change
my
mind
always
supposing
nothing
of
the
kind
there
was
no
sort
of
supposition
even
hinted
at
it
was
as
plain
and
unequivocal
a
promise
as
was
ever
made
by
a
to
b
do
you
see
ely
that
you
placing
me
in
a
delicate
position
in
what
sort
of
a
position
do
you
think
you
placing
me
would
you
have
me
marry
you
now
by
george
i
would
rising
from
her
seat
miss
truscott
placed
her
two
hands
behind
her
back
in
the
manner
in
which
the
children
do
at
school
looked
him
boldly
in
the
face
when
i
love
another
man
when
my
whole
heart
only
beats
for
him
when
in
a
sense
which
you
shall
never
understand
i
am
his
and
he
is
mine
ely
fidgeted
beneath
the
clear
scrutiny
of
her
eyes
look
here
miss
truscott
i
told
you
already
that
i
am
not
a
man
of
sentiment
do
you
call
this
a
question
of
sentiment
would
you
marry
a
woman
who
frankly
tells
you
that
she
loathes
you
and
that
she
yearns
for
another
man
loathes
me
by
gad
nice
thing
by
george
look
here
miss
truscott
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
ely
was
accentuating
his
words
by
striking
together
the
palms
of
his
hands
but
miss
truscott
cut
him
short
really
ely
you
are
like
a
child
you
indulge
in
the
vainest
repetitions
i
promised
fiddlesticks
for
all
i
know
i
do
intend
to
marry
you
so
there
an
end
of
it
do
you
we
shall
see
we
certainly
shall
see
miss
truscott
if
you
decline
to
fulfil
the
promise
which
you
made
to
me
according
to
your
own
confession
i
go
straight
from
here
to
my
solicitor
and
instruct
him
to
immediately
commence
an
action
against
you
for
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
you
will
find
that
even
a
woman
is
not
allowed
to
play
exactly
as
she
pleases
you
threaten
me
you
dare
to
threaten
me
now
i
see
the
business
man
indeed
it
is
damages
you
want
to
mend
your
broken
heart
the
money
not
the
wife
how
foolish
i
was
not
to
understand
all
that
before
can
we
not
compromise
the
case
we
principals
why
should
all
the
plunder
go
into
the
lawyer
hands
let
me
beg
your
acceptance
of
a
note
miss
truscott
took
out
her
purse
ten
pounds
ely
remembered
the
writ
which
he
had
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
i
get
thirty
thousand
pounds
at
least
thirty
thousand
pounds
what
a
sum
am
i
not
valued
at
i
am
afraid
ely
that
i
am
not
able
to
treat
with
you
when
you
speak
of
such
noble
figures
as
that
you
see
at
present
my
guardian
has
the
charge
of
my
pecuniary
affairs
but
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
am
glad
to
learn
that
you
can
find
compensation
even
in
the
prospect
of
such
a
sum
as
that
i
had
feared
that
your
wounded
affections
were
incurable
compensation
oh
yes
i
find
compensation
fast
enough
and
you
shall
find
it
too
that
letter
of
yours
shall
be
produced
in
court
you
shall
have
as
first
rate
an
advertisement
as
ever
yet
a
woman
had
i
give
summers
cause
to
be
proud
of
his
wife
i
am
so
pleased
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
because
of
course
i
hope
he
always
will
be
proud
of
me
you
know
i
hope
you
will
not
put
it
down
to
my
insufferable
conceit
but
i
do
think
he
ashamed
of
me
as
yet
but
it
is
quite
a
relief
to
my
mind
to
think
that
we
are
agreed
for
we
are
agreed
are
we
not
agreed
on
what
on
the
principle
of
compensation
oh
yes
there
no
doubt
that
we
agree
on
that
as
you
will
see
directly
i
get
back
to
town
that
is
most
gratifying
is
it
as
we
do
agree
now
wo
you
take
my
hand
before
he
knew
it
she
had
her
hand
in
his
she
was
looking
at
him
with
laughter
lighting
all
her
face
i
knew
that
we
should
understand
each
other
after
all
and
while
they
still
stood
there
hand
in
hand
looking
at
each
other
but
with
such
different
expressions
on
their
faces
the
door
opened
and
ash
came
in
chapter
xv
the
lady
explains
still
further
when
a
woman
says
she
will
she
will
you
may
depend
o
and
when
she
says
she
wo
she
wo
and
there
an
end
o
i
knew
you
would
i
knew
you
had
only
got
to
get
together
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
this
was
what
ash
said
as
he
entered
the
room
he
had
caught
miss
truscott
words
but
misapplied
their
meaning
he
advanced
towards
ely
with
beaming
countenance
i
congratulate
you
ely
i
do
with
all
my
heart
who
was
right
about
the
little
misunderstanding
now
did
i
not
tell
you
that
there
was
a
romantic
side
about
the
feminine
character
with
which
you
were
unacquainted
a
sort
of
airy
nothing
which
is
a
source
of
continual
perplexity
to
the
most
experienced
man
and
was
it
worth
it
all
for
the
sake
of
the
reconciliation
at
the
end
ely
gasped
this
this
is
the
final
straw
ah
my
boy
i
know
more
about
a
woman
than
you
we
old
bachelors
are
not
quite
blind
after
all
it
was
with
difficulty
that
ely
obtained
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
speak
do
i
understand
that
you
are
offering
me
your
congratulations
certainly
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
my
boy
ash
held
out
his
hand
ely
ignored
it
he
did
more
he
looked
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
have
spurned
it
from
him
he
eyed
ash
with
withering
scorn
i
a
fit
subject
for
congratulations
i
the
happiest
man
alive
i
suppose
there
no
man
in
england
who
has
more
cause
to
bless
his
stars
than
i
have
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
it
ely
i
can
not
tell
ely
started
as
though
he
had
been
shot
clive
had
in
her
turn
made
her
appearance
on
the
scene
she
too
had
overheard
his
words
she
came
sailing
across
the
room
all
smiles
and
condescension
i
knew
my
niece
you
see
who
should
know
her
if
not
i
the
girl
has
been
to
me
as
my
own
child
what
i
learnt
at
my
mother
knees
i
in
my
turn
have
taught
to
her
what
she
is
she
owes
to
me
receive
my
sincerest
congratulations
ely
upon
this
fortunate
event
ely
stared
at
the
old
lady
as
though
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
it
was
only
after
an
interval
that
his
thoughts
were
able
to
find
expression
in
speech
i
do
know
if
all
the
world
has
lost
its
mental
equilibrium
or
if
it
only
i
what
she
is
she
owes
to
you
i
do
know
that
i
should
like
to
be
owed
a
debt
like
that
by
george
you
have
taught
her
what
you
yourself
learnt
at
your
mother
knee
you
must
have
learnt
some
funny
things
and
as
for
your
congratulations
as
for
your
congratulations
madam
ely
settled
his
waistcoat
in
its
place
i
do
know
if
a
deliberate
insult
is
intended
but
in
any
case
you
may
postpone
your
congratulations
to
a
future
date
ash
looked
surprised
clive
bewildered
but
miss
truscott
laughed
the
most
musical
of
little
laughs
you
see
my
good
people
although
you
are
all
of
you
older
than
i
there
is
not
one
of
you
who
understands
that
one
consolation
said
ely
at
any
rate
miss
truscott
without
heeding
him
went
on
to
ash
and
clive
increasing
bewilderment
one
would
really
think
that
love
was
quite
a
new
creation
you
seem
never
to
have
heard
of
it
before
you
see
guardian
she
turned
with
an
air
of
the
most
bewitching
frankness
to
ash
when
your
letter
came
i
was
more
than
twelve
months
gone
in
love
i
think
that
love
must
be
a
sort
of
disease
which
has
to
run
its
course
through
different
stages
i
was
in
the
stage
of
dark
despair
at
that
moment
i
would
have
married
pompey
had
he
asked
me
i
looked
on
ely
just
as
i
would
have
looked
on
pompey
you
understand
flattering
upon
my
word
ely
was
just
able
to
articulate
but
miss
truscott
only
looked
at
him
and
laughed
but
the
morning
after
that
stage
had
passed
away
and
with
it
all
the
things
which
appertained
to
it
had
gone
whether
you
call
it
pompey
or
ely
it
is
just
the
same
those
things
had
gone
i
was
sane
again
in
my
right
mind
love
claimed
me
on
that
day
and
of
course
when
love
claimed
me
i
was
his
for
to
think
she
bore
herself
quite
straight
with
her
head
a
little
back
so
that
in
some
strange
way
she
seemed
to
have
grown
in
stature
before
their
very
eyes
for
to
think
that
this
to
me
means
love
she
motioned
to
ely
with
her
hand
this
little
gentleman
of
stocks
and
shares
it
is
the
most
foolish
thing
that
ever
yet
i
heard
none
knows
better
than
this
gentleman
himself
that
love
is
just
the
thing
he
does
not
even
care
to
understand
and
to
me
love
with
the
eternity
of
meaning
the
little
word
conveys
is
all
the
world
she
favoured
ely
with
her
most
sweeping
curtsey
the
sweetest
mockery
of
laughter
in
her
eyes
ely
i
wish
you
sir
good
day
for
the
which
cost
you
twenty
pounds
i
hope
that
you
will
find
a
wearer
soon
she
went
to
the
window
and
stood
just
outside
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
one
word
in
confidence
next
time
you
ask
a
girl
to
be
your
wife
do
not
insist
upon
it
as
your
chiefest
qualification
for
the
married
state
that
you
are
indeed
a
business
man
she
passed
down
the
steps
and
across
the
lawn
and
went
away
and
directly
she
was
out
of
sight
they
heard
her
voice
upraised
in
a
burst
of
joyous
song
chapter
xvi
thunder
in
the
air
there
was
silence
in
the
room
an
awkward
silence
for
some
moments
nobody
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
anything
left
to
say
it
was
noticeable
that
neither
of
the
trio
seemed
to
care
to
look
the
other
in
the
face
ely
stood
with
his
hands
thrust
to
the
extremest
depths
of
his
trouser
pockets
staring
moodily
not
to
say
savagely
at
the
window
through
which
miss
truscott
had
disappeared
ash
stroked
his
chin
with
something
of
an
embarrassed
air
he
did
not
seem
to
know
where
to
rest
his
eyes
from
the
expression
of
her
countenance
and
from
her
bearing
altogether
clive
seemed
to
have
had
the
faculty
of
speech
knocked
out
of
her
as
perhaps
was
natural
ely
was
the
first
who
found
his
tongue
he
pointed
his
words
by
looking
at
clive
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
that
a
nice
way
in
which
to
bring
up
a
girl
his
tone
was
distinctly
venomous
ash
continued
to
stroke
his
chin
it
does
seem
he
hazarded
in
a
sort
of
deprecatory
undertone
it
does
seem
as
though
she
had
imbibed
some
curious
ideas
that
the
sort
of
girl
to
do
anybody
credit
i
confess
said
ash
with
a
little
cough
as
though
he
wished
to
apologise
for
his
confession
i
confess
that
i
am
surprised
clive
blissfully
unconscious
that
it
could
enter
into
philosophy
to
think
of
attacking
her
remained
sublimely
statuesque
i
say
without
the
slightest
hesitation
that
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
education
of
that
young
woman
has
committed
a
crime
against
society
ely
turned
on
clive
with
something
that
was
very
like
a
snarl
the
old
lady
started
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
occur
to
her
that
the
words
were
spoken
with
intention
ash
who
was
still
engaged
upon
his
chin
did
not
appear
to
be
able
to
go
quite
as
far
as
his
friend
that
eh
is
perhaps
a
strongish
thing
to
say
hardly
crime
but
it
really
does
appear
that
blame
rests
somewhere
it
really
does
but
ely
was
not
to
be
gainsayed
no
toning
down
of
truths
for
him
i
said
and
i
say
again
that
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
bringing
up
of
that
young
woman
has
committed
a
crime
against
society
he
turned
so
that
he
looked
clive
straight
in
the
face
a
girl
is
entrusted
to
her
aunt
to
receive
her
education
if
that
aunt
betrays
her
trust
miseducates
the
child
then
i
challenge
contradiction
when
i
say
that
that
aunt
pulls
away
one
of
the
props
the
absence
of
whose
support
threatens
to
undermine
the
very
fabric
of
society
eh
there
is
eh
of
course
one
must
admit
that
there
is
a
certain
substratum
of
truth
in
that
is
it
possible
smoothing
the
front
of
her
dress
with
her
two
hands
it
was
evident
that
clive
was
awaking
to
the
nature
of
the
outrageous
attack
of
which
she
was
being
made
the
victim
is
it
possible
that
these
remarks
are
directed
against
me
thrusting
his
thumbs
into
his
waistcoat
armholes
ely
began
to
stride
about
the
room
oh
it
easy
to
throw
about
oneself
the
cloak
of
womanhood
and
to
claim
that
the
privilege
of
sex
exonerates
from
blame
but
i
should
like
to
know
if
this
is
to
be
the
fate
of
the
coming
generation
of
young
women
what
will
our
future
mothers
be
imitating
ely
ash
also
thrust
his
thumbs
into
his
waistcoat
armholes
just
so
what
will
our
future
mothers
be
our
future
mothers
am
i
not
a
mother
then
but
neither
of
the
gentlemen
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
clive
it
is
not
a
question
of
our
mothers
only
it
is
a
question
of
our
fathers
too
that
is
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
maternal
and
paternal
questions
are
closely
intertwined
i
never
thought
clive
produced
her
handkerchief
i
never
thought
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
this
day
clive
began
to
cry
but
neither
of
the
gentlemen
seemed
at
all
abashed
they
had
a
duty
to
perform
and
evidently
meant
to
carry
it
through
acts
our
judges
are
for
good
or
ill
fatal
shadows
which
march
by
us
still
it
was
such
an
unusual
thing
for
ely
to
essay
quotation
that
it
was
not
surprising
if
the
poet
words
got
slightly
mangled
in
production
the
thing
you
do
is
like
the
seed
you
sow
it
grows
and
grows
until
it
assumes
gigantic
proportions
and
blights
your
life
and
the
lives
of
all
whose
paths
you
cross
you
can
not
get
away
from
that
you
certainly
can
not
get
away
from
that
that
is
well
put
very
well
put
indeed
but
clive
was
not
to
be
trampled
upon
in
silence
she
turned
on
ely
with
undaunted
mien
may
i
ask
ely
for
an
explanation
of
the
language
which
you
use
your
niece
is
sufficient
explanation
you
say
that
what
she
is
she
owes
to
you
i
presume
her
singular
notions
of
morality
among
the
rest
ahem
ash
contented
himself
with
clearing
his
throat
ely
i
am
as
much
surprised
at
my
niece
behaviour
as
you
can
possibly
be
surprised
madam
why
are
you
surprised
you
say
that
you
have
handed
on
to
her
the
precepts
which
you
yourself
imbibed
at
your
knee
sir
clive
turned
towards
ash
with
her
grandest
air
ash
may
i
ask
you
to
protect
me
from
this
gentleman
i
certainly
understood
you
to
say
stammered
ash
when
he
was
thus
appealed
to
that
you
had
handed
on
to
her
the
precepts
which
you
had
imbibed
at
your
mother
knees
mr
ash
up
went
the
handkerchief
to
the
injured
lady
eyes
it
easy
enough
to
cry
sneered
ely
i
believe
that
some
people
keep
a
stock
of
tears
on
hand
at
the
same
time
he
turned
on
ash
with
a
sudden
ferocity
that
was
really
startling
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
acquit
you
entirely
from
blame
clive
tears
were
checked
in
the
very
act
of
starting
to
her
eyes
ash
about
to
move
from
the
position
in
front
of
the
fireplace
which
he
had
occupied
until
then
was
apparently
momentarily
turned
into
stone
this
sudden
change
of
front
seemed
to
take
him
very
much
aback
oh
i
know
i
know
continued
ely
you
may
stare
at
me
as
much
as
you
please
but
i
not
to
be
frightened
by
your
looks
i
not
forgotten
how
you
tried
to
rob
me
once
before
this
exclaimed
ash
looking
up
as
though
he
apostrophised
the
skies
is
the
most
outrageous
attack
of
which
i
ever
heard
he
had
apparently
forgotten
that
clive
had
just
been
the
victim
of
a
very
similar
attack
in
which
he
and
his
present
antagonist
had
joined
their
forces
bah
cried
ely
stuff
and
nonsense
whenever
there
is
any
dirty
work
about
i
always
see
your
hand
who
robbed
me
of
a
thousand
pounds
this
exclaimed
ash
extending
his
hands
as
though
he
were
addressing
an
unseen
audience
is
the
man
who
robbed
me
of
five
hundred
and
pounds
thirteen
and
fourpence
ely
flung
himself
upon
a
seat
and
nursed
his
knee
if
i
had
done
what
i
ought
to
have
done
i
should
have
locked
you
up
locked
me
up
the
words
were
gasped
rather
than
spoken
ash
turned
to
clive
with
the
apparent
intention
of
explaining
to
her
the
situation
it
perhaps
required
explanation
madam
you
see
this
man
this
man
was
the
recent
friend
of
his
bosom
frederic
ely
he
is
so
incapable
of
concealing
his
true
character
that
even
an
inexperienced
girl
has
found
him
out
and
because
she
very
properly
refuses
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
at
any
price
he
turns
on
me
madam
ash
became
warmer
as
he
spoke
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
intricacies
of
the
stock
exchange
but
i
think
you
will
understand
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
once
sold
him
a
quantity
of
a
certain
stock
and
when
there
was
a
fall
so
that
there
was
a
profit
in
my
favour
of
five
hundred
and
pounds
thirteen
shillings
he
had
the
audacity
to
say
that
i
had
bought
not
sold
and
he
actually
declared
that
the
transaction
had
referred
to
double
amount
of
the
stock
than
was
in
reality
the
case
and
he
even
preferred
a
claim
against
me
for
over
a
thousand
pounds
how
shocking
said
clive
though
it
may
be
suspected
that
she
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
explain
what
was
shocking
if
she
had
been
required
to
do
so
on
the
spot
ely
rose
from
his
seat
he
seemed
more
at
his
ease
than
he
had
been
since
he
entered
the
room
as
though
falling
out
with
ash
had
relieved
his
mind
ah
he
observed
that
the
sort
of
man
he
is
if
he
robbed
his
mother
he
would
swear
that
she
robbed
him
but
perhaps
he
not
to
blame
according
to
the
new
philosophy
that
sort
of
thing
is
in
the
blood
ash
turned
pale
clive
may
i
ask
you
to
withdraw
that
another
of
his
dodges
he
does
want
you
to
know
what
sort
of
man
he
is
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
not
the
least
he
not
the
sort
of
man
i
should
care
to
choose
to
be
trustee
to
my
girl
he
is
the
sort
of
man
who
regards
a
trusteeship
as
the
royal
road
to
wealth
ash
began
to
grow
angry
which
was
not
surprising
on
the
whole
clive
that
man
is
the
greatest
thief
in
town
that
why
he
wanted
me
to
marry
his
ward
that
we
might
go
halves
you
know
this
remark
so
evidently
enraged
ash
that
clive
actually
feared
that
hostilities
would
be
commenced
upon
her
floor
she
endeavoured
to
interpose
gentlemen
i
must
beg
of
you
to
consider
where
you
are
you
must
ask
from
him
impossibilities
he
ca
realise
that
in
a
respectable
house
you
know
ash
almost
foamed
at
the
lips
if
you
will
not
withdraw
clive
then
in
your
presence
i
shall
be
compelled
to
thrash
this
man
within
an
inch
of
his
life
gentlemen
i
do
beg
of
you
i
pray
there
not
the
slightest
occasion
to
be
alarmed
threatened
men
proverbially
live
long
honest
men
know
from
experience
that
they
can
listen
unmoved
to
the
tall
language
used
by
the
more
doubtful
members
of
society
ely
ostentatiously
jingled
the
money
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
smiled
a
beatific
smile
you
hound
clive
was
in
time
to
seize
ash
uplifted
arm
mr
ash
she
cried
hallo
ash
what
the
matter
ash

to
exhibit
a
little
valour
on
the
cheap
you
cur
ash
caught
ely
by
the
collar
and
ely
sprang
at
throat
the
lady
screamed
a
very
pretty
fight
was
spoiled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
other
actors
on
the
scene
chapter
xvii
ely
throws
the
lady
over
guardian
ely
what
is
the
matter
now
miss
truscott
and
summers
were
standing
at
the
window
they
had
approached
unperceived
in
the
excitement
of
the
little
argument
which
had
been
taking
place
within
the
lady
face
was
lighted
with
her
sweetest
happiest
smile
the
gentleman
too
seemed
at
his
ease
he
had
the
lady
hand
in
his
the
perfect
agreement
which
evidently
existed
between
the
lovers
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
perfect
disagreement
which
was
conspicuous
within
outside
the
room
perfect
peace
inside
the
room
a
raging
storm
on
the
appearance
of
this
united
pair
the
combatants
had
the
grace
to
let
each
other
go
all
signs
of
actual
violence
vanished
into
space
the
old
lady
ceased
to
scream
ash
hastened
to
the
window
his
plumes
were
still
a
little
ruffled
lily
you
have
been
better
advised
than
i
commend
your
choice
rather
than
see
you
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
frederic
ely
i
would
cut
your
throat
miss
truscott
looked
surprised
ash
language
was
strong
in
an
unexpected
place
summers
laughed
outright
ely
picked
up
his
hat
which
had
been
up
to
now
reposing
on
a
chair
and
settled
it
upon
his
head
summers
i
ca
congratulate
you
i
really
ca
not
that
i
have
anything
to
say
against
the
lady
at
least
not
much
but
the
man
ash
her
guardian
is
the
most
notorious
character
in
town
rather
than
become
in
any
way
connected
with
such
a
person
as
that
i
would
march
single
to
the
silent
grave
good
day
clive
i
hope
that
pompey
continues
in
the
enjoyment
of
good
health
nodding
slightly
to
clive
ely
swaggered
from
the
room
miss
truscott
look
of
surprise
when
he
had
gone
was
comical
guardian
what
does
this
mean
ash
still
seemed
a
little
uncomfortable
but
he
tried
to
pass
it
off
as
lightly
as
he
could
nothing
my
dear
nothing
let
me
beg
of
you
to
dismiss
the
incident
wholly
from
your
mind
ely
has
revealed
an
unexpected
phase
in
his
character
but
it
was
a
phase
which
was
better
discovered
early
than
late
i
assure
you
that
your
engagement
with
my
old
friend
summers
gives
me
complete
content
may
your
days
be
happy
and
your
love
live
long
the
lady
looked
her
lover
in
the
face
it
will
live
long
i
think
i
am
sure
it
will
said
he
they
clasped
each
other
by
the
hand
the
old
lady
and
the
stockbroker
turned
away
there
is
a
candour
about
true
love
which
worldly
minds
find
at
times
embarrassing
shortly
afterwards
the
following
announcement
appeared
in
a
daily
paper
ely
on
the
instant
at

cards
miss
truscott
showed
this
to
summers
they
laughed
together
when
they
read
it
not
many
weeks
elapsed
before
their
names
appeared
in
the
same
column
of
