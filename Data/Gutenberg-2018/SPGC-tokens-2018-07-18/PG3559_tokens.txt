i
had
been
three
months
at
hamburg
when
i
learned
that
the
emperor
had
at
last
resolved
to
abolish
the
only
remaining
memorial
of
the
republic
namely
the
revolutionary
calendar
that
calendar
was
indeed
an
absurd
innovation
for
the
new
denominations
of
the
months
were
not
applicable
in
all
places
even
in
france
the
corn
of
provence
did
not
wait
to
be
opened
by
the
sun
of
the

of

on
the

september
a
decreed
that
on
the
of
january
following
the
months
and
days
should
resume
their
own
names
i
read
with
much
interest
laplace
report
to
the
senate
and
must
confess
i
was
very
glad
to
see
the
gregorian
calendar
again
acknowledged
by
law
as
it
had
already
been
acknowledged
in
fact
frenchmen
in
foreign
countries
experienced
particular
inconvenience
from
the
adoption
of
a
system
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
a
few
days
after
the
revival
of
the
old
calendar
the
emperor
departed
for
the
army
when
at
hamburg
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
i
was
anxious
to
obtain
news
and
i
received
plenty
from
the
interior
of
germany
and
from
some
friends
in
paris
this
correspondence
enables
me
to
present
to
my
readers
a
comprehensive
and
accurate
picture
of
the
state
of
public
affairs
up
to
the
time
when
napoleon
took
the
field
i
have
already
mentioned
how
artfully
he
always
made
it
appear
that
he
was
anxious
for
peace
and
that
he
was
always
the
party
attacked
his
conduct
previous
to
the
first
conquest
of
vienna
affords
a
striking
example
of
this
artifice
it
was
pretty
evident
that
the
transformation
of
the
cisalpine
republic
into
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
the
union
of
genoa
to
france
were
infractions
of
treaties
yet
the
emperor
nevertheless
pretended
that
all
the
infractions
were
committed
by
austria
the
truth
is
that
austria
was
raising
levies
as
secretly
as
possible
and
collecting
her
troops
on
the
frontiers
of
bavaria
an
austrian
corps
even
penetrated
into
some
provinces
of
the
electorate
all
this
afforded
napoleon
a
pretest
for
going
to
the
aid
of
his
allies
in
the
memorable
sitting
preceding
his
departure
the
emperor
presented
a
project
of
a
relative
to
the
of
the
national
guard
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
read
an
explanation
of
the
reciprocal
conduct
of
france
and
austria
since
the
peace
of
luneville
in
which
the
offences
of
france
were
concealed
with
wonderful
skill
before
the
sitting
broke
up
the
emperor
addressed
the
members
stating
that
he
was
about
to
leave
the
capital
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army
to
afford
prompt
succour
to
his
allies
and
defend
the
dearest
interests
of
his
people
he
boasted
of
his
wish
to
preserve
peace
which
austria
and
russia
as
he
alleged
had
through
the
influence
of
england
been
induced
to
disturb
this
address
produced
a
very
powerful
impression
in
hamburg
for
my
part
i
recognised
in
it
napoleon
usual
boasting
strain
but
on
this
occasion
events
seemed
bent
on
justifying
it
the
emperor
may
certainly
have
performed
more
scientific
campaigns
than
that
of
austerlitz
but
never
any
more
glorious
in
results
everything
seemed
to
partake
of
the
marvellous
and
i
have
often
thought
of
the
secret
joy
which
bonaparte
must
have
felt
on
seeing
himself
at
last
an
the
point
of
commencing
a
great
war
in
germany
for
which
he
had
so
often
expressed
an
ardent
desire
he
proceeded
first
to
strasburg
whither
josephine
accompanied
him
all
the
reports
that
i
received
agreed
with
the
statements
of
my
private
correspondence
in
describing
the
incredible
enthusiasm
which
prevailed
in
the
army
on
learning
that
it
was
to
march
into
germany
for
the
first
time
napoleon
had
recourse
to
an
expeditious
mode
of
transport
and
carriages
conveyed
his
army
as
if
by
enchantment
from
the
shores
of
the
channel
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
the
idea
of
an
active
campaign
fired
the
ambition
of
the
junior
part
of
the
army
all
dreamed
of
glory
and
of
speedy
promotion
and
all
hoped
to
distinguish
themselves
before
the
eyes
of
a
chief
who
was
idolised
by
his
troops
thus
during
his
short
stay
at
strasburg
the
emperor
might
with
reason
prophesy
the
success
which
crowned
his
efforts
under
the
walls
of
vienna
rapp
who
accompanied
him
informed
me
that
on
leaving
strasburg
he
observed
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
it
will
be
said
that
i
made
mack
plan
of
campaign
for
him
the
caudine
forks
are
at
ulm
this
allusion
to
the
caudine
forks
was
always
in
napoleon
mouth
when
he
saw
an
enemy
army
concentrated
on
a
point
and
foresaw
its
defeat
bourrienne
experience
proved
that
bonaparte
was
not
deceived
but
i
ought
on
this
occasion
to
contradict
a
calumnious
report
circulated
at
that
time
and
since
maliciously
repeated
it
has
been
said
that
there
existed
an
understanding
between
mack
and
bonaparte
and
that
the
general
was
bought
over
to
deliver
up
the
gates
of
ulm
i
have
received
positive
proof
that
this
assertion
is
a
scandalous
falsehood
and
the
only
thing
that
could
give
it
weight
was
napoleon
intercession
after
the
campaign
that
mack
might
not
be
put
on
his
trial
in
this
intercession
napoleon
was
actuated
only
by
humanity
on
taking
the
field
napoleon
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
bavarians
with
whom
be
opposed
the
enemy
army
before
the
arrival
of
his
own
troops
as
soon
as
they
were
assembled
he
published
the
following
proclamation
which
still
further
excited
the
ardour
of
the
troops
soldiers
the
war
of
the
third
coalition
is
commenced
the
austrian
army
has
passed
the
inn
violated
treaties
attacked
and
driven
our
ally
from
his
capital
you
yourselves
have
been
obliged
to
hasten
by
forced
marches
to
the
defence
of
our
frontiers
but
you
have
now
passed
the
rhine
and
we
will
not
stop
till
we
have
secured
the
independence
of
the
germanic
body
succoured
our
allies
and
humbled
the
pride
of
our
unjust
assailants
we
will
not
again
make
peace
without
a
sufficient
guarantee
our
generosity
shall
not
again
wrong
our
policy
soldiers
your
emperor
is
among
you
you
are
but
the
advanced
guard
of
the
great
people
if
it
be
necessary
they
will
all
rise
at
my
call
to
confound
and
dissolve
this
new
league
which
has
been
created
by
the
malice
and
the
gold
of
england
but
soldiers
we
shall
have
forced
marches
to
make
fatigues
and
privations
of
every
kind
to
endure
still
whatever
obstacles
may
be
opposed
to
us
we
will
conquer
them
and
we
will
never
rest
until
we
have
planted
our
eagles
on
the
territory
of
our
enemies
in
the
confidential
notes
of
his
diplomatic
agents
in
his
speeches
and
in
his
proclamations
napoleon
always
described
himself
as
the
attacked
party
and
perhaps
his
very
earnestness
in
so
doing
sufficed
to
reveal
the
truth
to
all
those
who
had
learned
to
read
his
thoughts
differently
from
what
his
words
expressed
them
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
of
austerlitz
a
circumstance
occurred
from
which
is
to
be
dated
the
fortune
of
a
very
meritorious
man
while
the
emperor
was
at
strasburg
he
asked
general
marescot
the
chief
of
the
engineers
whether
he
could
recommend
from
his
corps
a
brave
prudent
and
intelligent
young
officer
capable
of
being
entrusted
with
an
important
reconnoitering
mission
the
officer
selected
by
general
marescot
was
a
captain
in
the
engineers
named
bernard
who
had
been
educated
in
the
polytechnic
school
he
set
off
on
his
mission
advanced
almost
to
vienna
and
returned
to
the
headquarters
of
the
emperor
at
the
capitulation
of
ulm
bonaparte
interrogated
him
himself
and
was
well
satisfied
with
his
replies
but
not
content
with
answering
verbally
the
questions
put
by
napoleon
captain
bernard
had
drawn
up
a
report
of
what
he
observed
and
the
different
routes
which
might
be
taken
among
other
things
he
observed
that
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
direct
the
whole
army
upon
vienna
without
regard
to
the
fortified
places
for
that
once
master
of
the
capital
of
austria
the
emperor
might
dictate
laws
to
all
the
austrian
monarchy
i
was
present
said
rapp
to
me
at
this
young
officer
interview
with
the
emperor
after
reading
the
report
would
you
believe
that
the
emperor
flew
into
a
furious
passion
cried
he
are
very
bold
very
presumptuous
a
young
officer
to
take
the
liberty
of
tracing
out
a
plan
of
campaign
for
me
begone
and
await
my
orders
this
and
some
other
circumstances
which
i
shall
have
to
add
respecting
captain
bernard
completely
reveal
napoleon
character
rapp
told
me
that
as
soon
as
the
young
officer
had
left
the
emperor
all
at
once
changed
his
tone
that
said
he
is
a
clever
young
man
he
has
taken
a
proper
view
of
things
i
shall
not
expose
him
to
the
chance
of
being
shot
perhaps
i
shall
sometime
want
his
services
tell
berthier
to
despatch
an
order
for
his
departure
for
elyria
this
order
was
despatched
and
captain
bernard
who
like
his
comrades
was
ardently
looking
forward
to
the
approaching
campaign
regarded
as
a
punishment
what
was
on
the
emperor
part
a
precaution
to
preserve
a
young
man
whose
merit
he
appreciated
at
the
close
of
the
campaign
when
the
emperor
promoted
those
officers
who
had
distinguished
themselves
bernard
who
was
thought
to
be
in
disgrace
was
not
included
in
berthier
list
among
the
captains
of
engineers
whom
he
recommended
to
the
rank
of
chef
de
bataillon
but
napoleon
himself
inscribed
name
before
all
the
rest
however
the
emperor
forgot
him
for
some
time
and
it
was
only
an
accidental
circumstance
that
brought
him
to
his
recollection
i
never
had
any
personal
acquaintance
with
bernard
but
i
learned
from
rapp
how
he
afterwards
became
his
colleague
as
aide
de
camp
to
the
emperor
a
circumstance
which
i
shall
now
relate
though
it
refers
to
a
later
period
before
the
emperor
left
paris
for
the
campaign
of
he
wished
to
gain
precise
information
respecting
ragusa
and
elyria
he
sent
for
marmont
but
was
not
satisfied
with
his
answers
he
then
interrogated
several
other
generals
but
the
result
of
his
inquiries
always
was
this
is
all
very
well
but
it
is
not
what
i
want
i
do
not
know
ragusa
he
then
sent
for
general
dejean
who
had
succeeded
de
marescot
as
first
inspector
of
the
engineers
have
you
any
one
among
your
officers
he
asked
who
is
well
acquainted
with
ragusa
dejean
after
a
little
reflection
replied
sire
there
is
a
chef
de
bataillon
who
has
been
a
long
time
forgotten
but
who
knows
elyria
perfectly
what
his
name
ah
stop
bernard
i
remember
that
name
where
is
he
at
antwerp
sire
employed
on
the
fortifications
let
a
telegraphic
despatch
be
immediately
transmitted
by
semaphore
arms
desiring
him
to
mount
his
horse
and
come
with
all
speed
to
paris
the
promptitude
with
which
the
emperor
orders
were
always
executed
is
well
known
a
few
days
after
captain
bernard
was
in
the
cabinet
in
paris
napoleon
received
him
very
graciously
the
first
thing
he
said
was
talk
to
me
about
ragusa
this
was
a
favourite
mode
of
interrogation
with
him
in
similar
cases
and
i
have
heard
him
say
that
it
was
a
sure
way
of
drawing
out
all
that
a
man
had
observed
in
any
country
that
he
had
visited
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
bernard
information
respecting
elyria
and
when
the
chef
de
bataillon
had
finished
speaking
napoleon
said
colonel
bernard
i
am
now
acquainted
with
ragusa
the
emperor
afterwards
conversed
familiarly
with
him
entered
into
details
respecting
the
system
of
fortification
adopted
at
antwerp
referred
to
the
plan
of
the
works
criticised
it
and
showed
how
he
would
if
he
besieged
the
town
render
the
means
of
defence
unavailing
the
new
colonel
explained
so
well
how
he
would
defend
the
town
against
the
emperor
attack
that
bonaparte
was
delighted
and
immediately
bestowed
upon
the
young
officer
a
mark
of
distinction
which
as
far
as
i
know
he
never
granted
but
upon
that
single
occasion
the
emperor
was
going
to
preside
at
the
council
of
state
and
desired
colonel
bernard
to
accompany
him
and
many
times
during
the
sittings
be
asked
him
for
his
opinion
upon
the
points
which
were
under
discussion
on
leaving
the
council
napoleon
said
bernard
you
are
in
future
my
aide
de
camp
after
the
campaign
he
was
made
general
of
brigade
soon
after
general
of
division
and
now
he
is
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
the
ablest
engineer
officers
in
existence
clarke
silly
conduct
deprived
france
of
this
distinguished
man
who
refused
the
brilliant
offers
of
several
sovereigns
of
europe
for
the
sake
of
retiring
to
the
united
states
of
america
where
he
commands
the
engineers
and
has
constructed
fortifications
on
the
coast
of
the
floridas
which
are
considered
by
engineers
to
be
masterpieces

that
the
emperor
had
yet
joined
the
army
when
he
understood
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
napoleon
he
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
which
did
not
escape
the
emperor
and
he
ingenuously
acknowledged
that
general
mack
had
no
idea
he
was
before
the
walls
of
ulm
prince
liechtenstein
proposed
to
capitulate
on
condition
that
the
garrison
of
ulm
should
be
allowed
to
return
into
austria
this
proposal
in
the
situation
in
which
the
garrison
stood
rapp
said
made
the
emperor
smile
how
can
you
expect
said
napoleon
that
i
can
accede
to
such
a
proposition
what
shall
i
gain
by
it
eight
days
in
eight
days
you
will
be
in
my
power
without
any
condition
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
acquainted
with
everything
you
expect
the
russians
at
the
nearest
they
are
in
bohemia
were
i
to
allow
you
to
march
out
what
security
can
i
have
that
you
will
not
join
them
and
afterwards
fight
against
me
your
generals
have
deceived
me
often
enough
and
i
will
no
longer
be
duped
at
marengo
i
was
weak
enough
to
allow
the
troops
of
melas
to
march
out
of
alessandria
he
promised
to
treat
for
peace
what
happened
two
months
after
moreau
had
to
fight
with
the
garrison
of
alessandria
besides
this
war
is
not
an
ordinary
war
after
the
conduct
of
your
government
i
am
not
bound
to
keep
any
terms
with
it
i
have
no
faith
in
its
promises
you
have
attacked
me
if
i
should
agree
to
what
you
ask
mack
would
pledge
his
word
i
know
but
even
relying
on
his
good
faith
would
be
he
able
to
keep
his
promise
as
far
as
regards
himself
yes
but
as
regards
his
army
no
if
the
archduke
ferdinand
were
still
with
you
i
could
rely
upon
his
word
because
he
would
be
responsible
for
the
conditions
and
he
would
not
disgrace
himself
but
i
know
he
has
quitted
ulm
and
passed
the
danube
i
know
how
to
reach
him
however
rapp
said
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
the
embarrassment
of
prince
liechtenstein
whilst
the
emperor
was
speaking
he
however
somewhat
regained
his
and
observed
that
unless
the
conditions
which
he
proposed
were
granted
the
army
would
not
capitulate
if
that
be
the
case
said
napoleon
you
may
as
well
go
back
to
mack
for
i
will
never
grant
such
conditions
are
you
jesting
with
me
stay
here
is
the
capitulation
of
memingen
show
it
to
your
general
let
him
surrender
on
the
same
conditions
i
will
consent
to
no
others
your
officers
may
return
to
austria
but
the
soldiers
must
be
prisoners
tell
him
to
be
speedy
for
i
have
no
time
to
lose
the
more
he
delays
the
worse
he
will
render
his
own
condition
and
yours
i
shall
have
here
the
corps
to
which
memingen
capitulated
and
then
we
shall
see
what
is
to
be
done
make
mack
clearly
understand
that
he
has
no
alternative
but
to
conform
to
my
will
the
imperious
tones
which
napoleon
employed
towards
his
enemies
almost
always
succeeded
and
it
produced
the
accustomed
effect
upon
mack
on
the
same
day
that
prince
liechtenstein
had
been
at
our
headquarters
mack
wrote
to
the
emperor
stating
that
he
would
not
have
treated
with
any
other
on
such
terms
but
that
he
yielded
to
the
ascendency
of
napoleon
fortune
and
on
the
following
day
berthier
was
sent
into
ulm
from
whence
he
returned
with
the
capitulation
signed
thus
napoleon
was
not
mistaken
respecting
the
caudine
forks
of
the
austrian
army
the
garrison
of
ulm
marched
out
with
what
are
called
the
honours
of
war
and
were
led
prisoners
into
bourrienne
napoleon
who
was
so
violently
irritated
by
any
obstacle
which
opposed
him
and
who
treated
with
so
much
hauteur
everybody
who
ventured
to
resist
his
inflexible
will
was
no
longer
the
same
man
when
as
a
conqueror
he
received
the
vanquished
generals
at
ulm
he
condoled
with
them
on
their
misfortune
and
this
i
can
affirm
was
not
the
result
of
a
feeling
of
pride
concealed
beneath
a
feigned
generosity
although
he
profited
by
their
defeat
he
pitied
them
sincerely
how
frequently
has
he
observed
to
me
how
much
to
be
pitied
is
a
general
on
the
day
after
a
lost
battle
he
had
himself
experienced
this
misfortune
when
he
was
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
of
jean
at
that
moment
he
would
i
believe
have
strangled
djezzar
but
if
djezzar
had
surrendered
he
would
have
treated
him
with
the
same
attention
which
he
showed
to
mack
and
the
other
generals
of
the
garrison
of
ulm
these
generals
were
seventeen
in
number
and
among
them
was
prince
liechtenstein
there
were
also
general
klenau
baron
de
giulay
who
had
acquired
considerable
military
reputation
in
the
preceding
wars
and
general
fresnel
who
stood
in
a
more
critical
situation
than
his
companions
in
misfortune
for
he
was
a
frenchman
and
an
emigrant
rapp
told
me
that
it
was
really
painful
to
see
these
generals
they
bowed
respectfully
to
the
emperor
having
mack
at
their
head
they
preserved
a
mournful
silence
and
napoleon
was
the
first
to
speak
which
he
did
in
the
following
terms
gentlemen
i
feel
sorry
that
such
brave
men
as
you
are
should
be
the
victims
of
the
follies
of
a
cabinet
which
cherishes
insane
projects
and
which
does
not
hesitate
to
commit
the
dignity
of
the
austrian
nation
by
trafficking
with
the
services
of
its
generals
your
names
are
known
to
me
they
are
honourably
known
wherever
you
have
fought
examine
the
conduct
of
those
who
have
committed
you
what
could
be
more
iniquitous
than
to
attack
me
without
a
declaration
of
war
is
it
not
criminal
to
bring
foreign
invasion
upon
a
country
is
it
not
betraying
europe
to
introduce
asiatic
barbarities
into
her
disputes
if
good
policy
had
been
followed
the
aulic
council
instead
of
attacking
me
would
have
sought
my
alliance
in
order
to
drive
back
the
russians
to
the
north
the
alliance
which
your
cabinet
has
formed
will
appear
monstrous
in
history
it
is
the
alliance
of
dogs
shepherds
and
wolves
against
sheep
such
a
scheme
could
never
have
been
planned
in
the
mind
of
a
statesman
it
is
fortunate
for
you
that
i
have
not
been
defeated
in
the
unjust
struggle
to
which
i
have
been
provoked
if
i
had
the
cabinet
of
vienna
would
have
soon
perceived
its
error
for
which
perhaps
it
will
yet
one
day
pay
dearly
what
a
change
fifteen
days
of
success
crowned
by
the
capture
of
ulm
had
made
in
affairs
at
hamburg
i
knew
through
my
agents
to
what
a
degree
of
folly
the
hopes
of
napoleon
enemies
had
risen
before
he
began
the
campaign
the
security
of
the
cabinet
of
vienna
was
really
inexplicable
not
only
did
they
not
dream
of
the
series
of
victories
which
made
napoleon
master
of
all
the
austrian
monarchy
but
the
assistants
of
drake
and
all
the
intriguers
of
that
sort
treated
france
already
as
a
conquered
country
and
disposed
of
some
of
our
provinces
in
the
excess
of
their
folly
to
only
give
one
instance
they
promised
the
town
of
lyons
to
the
king
of
sardinia
to
recompense
him
for
the
temporary
occupation
of
piedmont
in
the
treaties
and
declarations
see
martens
and
thiers
tome
there
is
rather
a
tendency
to
sell
the
skin
of
the
bear
before
killing
him
while
napoleon
flattered
his
prisoners
at
the
expense
of
their
government
he
wished
to
express
satisfaction
at
the
conduct
of
his
own
army
and
with
this
view
he
published
a
remarkable
proclamation
which
in
some
measure
presented
an
abstract
of
all
that
had
taken
place
since
the
opening
of
the
campaign
this
proclamation
was
as
follows
soldiers
of
the
grand
army
in
a
fortnight
we
have
finished
an
entire
campaign
what
we
proposed
to
do
has
been
done
we
have
driven
the
austrian
troops
from
bavaria
and
restored
our
ally
to
the
sovereignty
of
his
dominions
that
army
which
with
equal
presumption
and
imprudence
marched
upon
our
frontiers
is
annihilated
but
what
does
this
signify
to
england
she
has
gained
her
object
we
are
no
longer
at
boulogne
and
her
subsidy
will
be
neither
more
nor
less
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
who
composed
that
army
sixty
thousand
are
prisoners
they
will
replace
our
conscripts
in
the
labours
of
agriculture
two
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
the
whole
park
of
artillery
ninety
flags
and
all
their
generals
are
in
our
power
fifteen
thousand
men
only
have
escaped
soldiers
i
announced
to
you
the
result
of
a
great
battle
but
thanks
to
the
schemes
of
the
enemy
i
was
enabled
to
secure
the
result
without
incurring
any
danger
and
what
is
unexampled
in
the
history
of
nations
that
result
has
been
gained
at
the
sacrifice
of
scarcely
fifteen
hundred
men
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
this
success
is
due
to
your
unlimited
confidence
in
your
emperor
to
your
patience
in
enduring
fatigues
and
privations
of
every
kind
and
to
your
singular
courage
and
intrepidity
but
we
will
not
stop
here
you
are
impatient
to
commence
another
campaign
the
russian
army
which
english
gold
has
brought
from
the
extremities
of
the
universe
shall
experience
the
same
fate
as
that
which
we
have
just
defeated
in
the
conflict
in
which
we
are
about
to
engage
the
honour
of
the
french
infantry
is
especially
concerned
we
shall
now
see
another
decision
of
the
question
which
has
already
been
determined
in
switzerland
and
holland
namely
whether
the
french
infantry
is
the
first
or
the
second
in
europe
among
the
russians
there
are
no
generals
in
contending
against
whom
i
can
acquire
any
glory
all
i
wish
is
to
obtain
the
victory
with
the
least
possible
bloodshed
my
soldiers
are
my
children
this
proclamation
always
appeared
to
me
a
masterpiece
of
military
eloquence
while
he
lavished
praises
on
his
troops
he
excited
their
emulation
by
hinting
that
the
russians
were
capable
of
disputing
with
them
the
first
rank
among
the
infantry
of
europe
and
he
concluded
his
address
by
calling
them
his
children
the
second
campaign
to
which
napoleon
alleged
they
so
eagerly
looked
forward
speedily
ensued
and
hostilities
were
carried
on
with
a
degree
of
vigour
which
fired
the
enthusiasm
of
the
army
heaven
knows
what
accounts
were
circulated
of
the
russians
who
as
bonaparte
solemnly
stated
in
his
proclamation
had
come
from
the
extremity
of
the
world
they
were
represented
as
savages
pillaging
destroying
and
burning
wherever
they
went
it
was
even
asserted
that
they
were
cannibals
and
had
been
seen
to
eat
children
in
short
at
that
period
was
introduced
the
denomination
of
northern
barbarians
which
has
since
been
so
generally
applied
to
the
russians
two
days
after
the
capitulation
of
ulm
murat
obtained
the
capitulation
of
trochtelfingen
from
general
yarneck
and
made
prisoners
so
that
without
counting
killed
and
wounded
the
austrian
army
had
sustained
a
diminution
of
men
after
a
campaign
of
twenty
days
on
the
of
october
the
french
army
crossed
the
inn
and
thus
penetrated
into
the
austrian
territory
salzburg
and
brannan
were
immediately
taken
the
army
of
italy
under
the
command
of
massena
was
also
obtaining
great
advantages
on
the
of
october
that
is
to
say
the
very
day
on
which
the
grand
army
took
the
fortresses
the
army
of
italy
having
crossed
the
adige
fought
a
sanguinary
battle
at
caldiero
and
took
austrian
prisoners
in
the
extraordinary
campaign
which
has
been
distinguished
by
the
name
of
the
campaign
of
austerlitz
the
exploits
of
our
troops
succeeded
each
other
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
i
confess
i
was
equally
astonished
and
delighted
when
i
received
a
note
from
duroc
sent
by
an
extraordinary
courier
and
commencing
laconically
with
the
words
we
are
in
vienna
the
emperor
is
well
duroc
letter
was
dated
the
november
and
the
words
we
are
in
vienna
seemed
to
me
the
result
of
a
dream
the
capital
of
austria
which
from
time
immemorial
had
not
been
occupied
by
foreigners
the
city
which
sobieski
had
saved
from
ottoman
violence
had
become
the
prey
of
the
imperial
eagle
of
france
which
after
a
lapse
of
three
centuries
avenged
the
humiliations
formerly
imposed
upon
francis
by
the
grifagna
of
charles
duroc
had
left
the
emperor
before
the
camp
of
boulogne
was
raised
his
mission
to
berlin
being
terminated
he
rejoined
the
emperor
at
lintz
as
soon
as
bonaparte
became
emperor
he
constituted
himself
the
avenger
of
all
the
insults
given
to
the
sovereigns
whom
he
styled
his
predecessors
all
that
related
to
the
honour
of
france
was
sacred
to
him
thus
he
removed
the
column
of
rosbach
from
the
prussian
bourrienne
before
i
noticed
the
singular
mission
of
haugwitz
to
the
emperor
napoleon
and
the
result
of
that
mission
which
circumstances
rendered
diametrically
the
reverse
of
its
object
i
will
relate
what
came
to
my
knowledge
respecting
some
other
negotiations
on
the
part
of
austria
the
evident
intent
of
which
was
to
retard
napoleon
progress
and
thereby
to
dupe
him
de
giulay
one
of
the
generals
included
in
the
capitulation
of
ulm
had
returned
home
to
acquaint
his
sovereign
with
the
disastrous
event
he
did
not
conceal
either
from
the
emperor
francis
or
the
cabinet
of
vienna
the
destruction
of
the
austrian
army
and
the
impossibility
of
arresting
the
rapid
advance
of
the
french
de
giulay
was
sent
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
the
headquarters
of
napoleon
to
assure
him
of
the
pacific
intentions
of
the
emperor
of
austria
and
to
solicit
an
armistice
the
snare
was
too
clumsy
not
to
be
immediately
discovered
by
so
crafty
a
man
as
napoleon
metternich
tome
ii
compare
french
edition
tome
ii
says
let
us
hold
always
the
sword
in
one
hand
and
the
olive
branch
in
the
other
always
ready
to
negotiate
but
only
negotiating
while
advancing
here
is
napoleons
system
he
had
always
pretended
a
love
for
peace
though
be
was
overjoyed
at
the
idea
of
continuing
a
war
so
successfully
commenced
and
he
directed
general
giulay
to
assure
the
emperor
of
austria
that
he
was
not
less
anxious
for
peace
than
he
and
that
he
was
ready
to
treat
for
it
but
without
suspending
the
course
of
his
operations
bonaparte
indeed
could
not
without
a
degree
of
imprudence
of
which
he
was
incapable
consent
to
an
armistice
for
de
giulay
though
entrusted
with
powers
from
austria
had
received
none
from
russia
russia
therefore
might
disavow
the
armistice
and
arrive
in
time
to
defend
vienna
the
occupation
of
which
was
so
important
to
the
french
army
the
russians
indeed
were
advancing
to
oppose
us
and
the
corps
of
our
army
commanded
by
mortier
on
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
experienced
in
the
first
engagement
a
check
at
dirnstein
which
not
a
little
vexed
the
emperor
this
was
the
first
reverse
of
fortune
we
had
sustained
throughout
the
campaign
it
was
trivial
to
be
sure
but
the
capture
by
the
russians
of
three
french
eagles
the
first
that
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
was
very
mortifying
to
napoleon
and
caused
him
to
prolong
for
some
days
his
staff
at
folten
where
he
then
was
the
rapid
occupation
of
vienna
was
due
to
the
successful
temerity
of
lannes
and
murat
two
men
alike
distinguished
for
courage
and
daring
spirit
a
bold
artifice
of
these
generals
prevented
the
destruction
of
the
thabor
bridge
at
vienna
without
which
our
army
would
have
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
penetrating
into
the
austrian
capital
this
act
of
courage
and
presence
of
mind
which
had
so
great
an
influence
on
the
events
of
the
campaign
was
described
to
me
by
lannes
who
told
the
story
with
an
air
of
gaiety
unaccompanied
by
any
complacency
and
seemed
rather
pleased
with
the
trick
played
upon
the
austrians
than
proud
of
the
brilliant
action
which
had
been
performed
bold
enterprises
were
so
natural
to
lannes
that
he
was
frequently
the
only
person
who
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
own
exploits
alas
what
men
were
sacrificed
to
napoleon
ambition
the
following
is
the
story
of
the
bridge
of
thabor
as
i
heard
it
from
lannes
i
was
one
day
walking
with
murat
on
the
right
bank
of
the
danube
and
we
observed
on
the
left
bank
which
was
occupied
by
the
austrians
some
works
going
on
the
evident
object
of
which
was
to
blow
up
the
bridge
on
the
approach
of
our
troops
the
fools
had
the
impudence
to
make
these
preparations
under
our
very
noses
but
we
gave
them
a
good
lesson
having
arranged
our
plan
we
returned
to
give
orders
and
i
entrusted
the
command
of
my
column
of
grenadiers
to
an
officer
on
whose
courage
and
intelligence
i
could
rely
i
then
returned
to
the
bridge
accompanied
by
murat
and
two
or
three
other
officers
we
advanced
unconcernedly
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
commander
of
a
post
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
we
spoke
to
him
about
an
armistice
which
was
to
be
speedily
concluded
while
conversing
with
the
austrian
officers
we
contrived
to
make
them
turn
their
eyes
towards
the
left
bank
and
then
agreeably
to
the
orders
we
had
given
my
column
of
grenadiers
advanced
on
the
bridge
the
austrian
cannoneers
on
the
left
bank
seeing
their
officers
in
the
midst
of
us
did
not
dare
to
fire
and
my
column
advanced
at
a
quick
step
murat
and
i
at
the
head
of
it
gained
the
left
bank
all
the
combustibles
prepared
for
blowing
up
the
bridge
were
thrown
into
the
river
and
my
men
took
possession
of
the
batteries
erected
for
the
defence
of
the
bridge
head
the
poor
devils
of
austrian
officers
were
perfectly
astounded
when
i
told
them
they
were
my
prisoners
such
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
was
the
account
given
by
lannes
who
laughed
immoderately
in
describing
the
consternation
of
the
austrian
officers
when
they
discovered
the
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
them
when
lannes
performed
this
exploit
he
had
little
idea
of
the
important
consequences
which
would
attend
it
he
had
not
only
secured
to
the
remainder
of
the
french
army
a
sure
and
easy
entrance
to
vienna
but
without
being
aware
of
it
he
created
an
insurmountable
impediment
to
the
junction
of
the
russian
army
with
the
austrian
corps
commanded
by
prince
charles
who
being
pressed
by
massena
hastily
advanced
into
the
heart
of
the
hereditary
states
where
he
fully
expected
a
great
battle
would
take
place
as
soon
as
the
corps
of
murat
and
lannes
had
taken
possession
of
vienna
the
emperor
ordered
all
the
divisions
of
the
army
to
march
upon
that
capital
the
story
to
told
in
much
the
same
way
in
theirs
tome
vi
rupp
and
savory
tome
ii
but
as
erreurs
tome
points
out
bourrienne
makes
an
odd
mistake
in
believing
the
thabor
bridge
gave
the
french
access
to
vienna
the
capital
is
on
the
right
bank
and
was
already
in
their
power
the
possession
of
the
bridge
enabled
them
to
pass
over
to
the
left
bank
and
to
advance
towards
austerlitz
before
the
archduke
charles
coming
from
italy
could
make
his
junction
with
the
allied
army
see
plan
of
thiers
atlas
or
of
alison
the
immediate
result
of
the
success
of
this
rather
doubtful
artifice
would
have
been
the
destruction
of
the
corps
of
kutusoff
but
murat
in
his
turn
was
deceived
by
bagration
into
belief
in
an
armistice
in
fact
both
sides
at
this
time
fell
into
curious
errors
napoleon
established
his
headquarters
at
schoenbrunn
where
he
planned
his
operations
for
compelling
the
corps
of
prince
charles
to
retire
to
hungary
and
also
for
advancing
his
own
forces
to
meet
the
russians
murat
and
lannes
always
commanded
the
advanced
guard
during
the
forced
marches
ordered
by
napoleon
which
were
executed
in
a
way
truly
miraculous
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
conclude
peace
as
soon
as
reasonable
propositions
should
be
made
to
him
napoleon
sent
for
his
minister
for
foreign
affairs
who
speedily
arrived
at
vienna
and
general
savary
was
sent
on
a
mission
to
the
emperor
alexander
the
details
of
this
mission
i
have
learned
only
from
the
account
of
it
given
by
the
duc
de
rovigo
in
his
apologetic
memoirs
in
spite
of
the
duke
eagerness
to
induce
a
belief
in
napoleon
pacific
disposition
the
very
facts
on
which
he
supports
his
argument
lead
to
the
contrary
conclusion
napoleon
wished
to
dictate
his
conditions
before
the
issue
of
a
battle
the
success
of
which
might
appear
doubtful
to
the
young
emperor
of
russia
and
these
conditions
were
such
as
he
might
impose
when
victory
should
be
declared
in
favour
of
our
eagles
it
must
be
clear
to
every
reflecting
person
that
by
always
proposing
what
he
knew
could
not
be
honourably
acceded
to
he
kept
up
the
appearance
of
being
a
pacificator
while
at
the
same
time
he
ensured
to
himself
the
pleasure
of
carrying
on
the
war

must
now
relate
how
in
conformity
with
my
instructions
i
was
employed
in
hamburg
in
aiding
the
success
of
the
french
army
i
had
sent
an
agent
to
observe
the
russian
troops
which
were
advancing
by
forced
marches
to
the
banks
of
the
elbe
this
agent
transmitted
to
me
from
gadbusch
an
account
of
the
routes
taken
by
the
different
columns
it
was
then
supposed
that
they
would
march
upon
holland
by
the
way
of
bremen
and
oldenburg
on
the
receipt
of
thus
intelligence
the
electorate
of
hanover
was
evacuated
by
the
french
and
general
barbou
who
had
commanded
there
concentrated
his
forces
in
hamelin
on
the
of
november
the
king
of
sweden
arrived
at
stralsund
i
immediately
intimated
to
our
government
that
this
circumstance
would
probably
give
a
new
turn
to
the
operations
of
the
combined
army
for
hitherto
the
uncertainty
of
its
movements
and
the
successive
orders
afforded
no
possibility
of
ascertaining
any
determined
plan
the
intention
seemed
to
be
that
all
the
troops
should
cross
the
elbe
at
the
same
point
lauenburg
six
miles
from
hamburg
there
was
not
on
the
of
november
a
single
russian
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
elbe
the
first
column
of
the
grand
russian
army
passed
through
warsaw
on
the
of
november
and
on
the
the
constantine
was
expected
with
the
guards
this
column
which
amounted
to
men
was
the
first
that
passed
through
prussian
poland
at
this
time
we
momentarily
expected
to
see
the
hanoverian
army
landed
on
the
banks
of
the
weser
or
the
elbe
augmented
by
some
thousands
of
english
their
design
apparently
was
either
to
attack
holland
or
to
attempt
some
operation
on
the
rear
of
our
grand
army
the
french
government
was
very
anxious
to
receive
accurate
accounts
of
the
march
of
the
troops
through
hanover
and
of
the
russian
army
through
poland
my
agents
at
warsaw
and
stralsund
who
were
exceedingly
active
and
intelligent
enabled
me
to
send
off
a
bulletin
describing
the
state
of
hanover
the
movements
of
the
russians
and
swedes
together
with
information
of
the
arrival
of
english
troops
in
the
elbe
and
a
statement
of
the
force
of
the
combined
army
in
hanover
which
consisted
of
russians
swedes
and
english
making
in
all
men
it
was
probably
on
account
of
this
bulletin
that
napoleon
expressed
to
duroc
his
satisfaction
with
my
services
the
emperor
on
recalling
duroc
from
berlin
did
not
manifest
the
least
apprehension
respecting
prussia
duroc
wrote
to
me
the
following
letter
on
the
occasion
of
his
recall
my
dear
bourrienne
the
emperor
having
thought
my
services
necessary
to
the
army
has
recalled
me
i
yesterday
had
a
farewell
audience
of
the
king
and
queen
who
treated
me
very
graciously
his
majesty
presented
me
with
his
portrait
set
in
diamonds
the
emperor
alexander
will
probably
depart
to
morrow
and
the
archduke
anthony
vary
speedily
we
can
not
but
hope
that
their
presence
here
will
facilitate
a
good
understanding
signed
duroc
whenever
foreign
armies
were
opposing
france
the
hopes
of
the
emigrants
revived
they
falsely
imagined
that
the
powers
coalesced
against
napoleon
were
labouring
in
their
cause
and
many
of
them
entered
the
russian
and
austrian
armies
of
this
number
was
general
dumouriez
i
received
information
that
he
had
landed
at
stade
on
the
of
november
but
whither
he
intended
to
proceed
was
not
known
a
man
named
martin
whose
wife
lived
with
dumouriez
and
who
had
accompanied
the
general
from
england
to
stade
came
to
hamburg
where
he
observed
great
precautions
for
concealment
and
bought
two
carriages
which
were
immediately
forwarded
to
stade
st
martin
himself
immediately
proceeded
to
the
latter
place
i
was
blamed
for
not
having
arrested
this
man
but
he
had
a
commission
attesting
that
he
was
in
the
english
service
and
as
i
have
before
mentioned
a
foreign
commission
was
a
safeguard
and
the
only
one
which
could
not
be
violated
in
hamburg
in
december
the
english
recruiting
in
hanover
was
kept
up
without
interruption
and
attended
with
extraordinary
success
sometimes
a
hundred
men
were
raised
in
a
day
the
misery
prevailing
in
germany
which
had
been
ravaged
by
the
war
the
hatred
against
the
french
and
the
high
bounty
that
was
offered
enabled
the
english
to
procure
as
many
men
as
they
wished
the
king
of
sweden
meditating
on
the
stir
he
should
make
in
hanover
took
with
him
a
camp
to
publish
the
bulletins
of
the
grand
swedish
the
first
of
these
bulletins
announced
to
europe
that
his
swedish
majesty
was
about
to
leave
stralsund
and
that
his
army
would
take
up
its
position
partly
between
nelsen
and
haarburg
and
partly
between
domitz
and
the
frontiers
of
hamburg
among
the
anecdotes
of
napoleon
connected
with
this
campaign
i
find
in
my
notes
the
following
which
was
related
to
me
by
rapp
some
days
before
his
entrance
into
vienna
napoleon
who
was
riding
on
horseback
along
the
road
dressed
in
his
usual
uniform
of
the
chasseurs
of
the
guard
met
an
open
carriage
in
which
were
seated
a
lady
and
a
priest
the
lady
was
in
tears
and
napoleon
could
not
refrain
from
stopping
to
ask
her
what
was
the
cause
of
her
distress
sir
she
replied
for
she
did
not
know
the
emperor
i
have
been
pillaged
at
my
estate
two
leagues
from
hence
by
a
party
of
soldiers
who
have
murdered
my
gardener
i
am
going
to
seek
your
emperor
who
knows
my
family
to
whom
he
was
once
under
great
obligations
what
is
your
name
inquired
de
bunny
replied
the
lady
i
am
the
daughter
of
m
de
marbeuf
formerly
governor
of
corsica
madame
exclaimed
napoleon
i
am
the
emperor
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
serving
you
you
can
not
conceive
continued
rapp
the
attention
which
the
emperor
showed
madame
de
bunny
he
consoled
her
pitied
her
almost
apologised
for
the
misfortune
she
had
sustained
you
have
the
goodness
madame
said
he
go
and
wait
for
me
at
my
i
will
join
you
speedily
every
member
of
de
marbeuf
family
has
a
claim
on
my
respect
the
emperor
immediately
gave
her
a
picquet
of
chasseurs
of
his
guard
to
escort
her
he
saw
her
again
during
the
day
when
he
loaded
her
with
attentions
and
liberally
indemnified
her
for
the
losses
she
had
sustained
for
some
time
previous
to
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
different
corps
of
the
army
intersected
every
part
of
germany
and
italy
all
tending
towards
vienna
as
a
central
point
at
the
beginning
of
november
the
corps
commanded
by
marshal
bernadotte
arrived
at
saltzburg
at
the
moment
when
the
emperor
had
advanced
his
headquarters
to
braunau
where
there
were
numerous
magazines
of
artillery
and
a
vast
quantity
of
provisions
of
every
kind
the
junction
of
the
corps
commanded
by
bernadotte
in
hanover
with
the
grand
army
was
a
point
of
such
high
importance
that
bonaparte
had
directed
the
marshal
to
come
up
with
him
as
speedily
as
possible
and
to
take
the
shortest
road
this
order
obliged
bernadotte
to
pass
through
the
territory
of
the
two
margravates
at
that
time
we
were
at
peace
with
naples
in
september
the
emperor
had
concluded
with
ferdinand
iv
a
treaty
of
neutrality
this
treaty
enabled
carra
cyr
who
occupied
naples
to
evacuate
that
city
and
to
join
massena
in
upper
italy
both
reached
the
grand
army
on
the
of
november
but
no
sooner
had
the
troops
commanded
by
carra
cyr
quitted
the
neapolitan
territory
than
the
king
of
naples
influenced
by
his
ministers
and
above
all
by
queen
caroline
broke
the
treaty
of
neutrality
ordered
hostile
preparations
against
france
opened
his
ports
to
the
enemies
of
the
emperor
and
received
into
his
states
russians
and
english
it
was
on
the
receipt
of
this
news
that
bonaparte
in
one
of
his
most
violent
bulletins
styled
the
queen
of
naples
a
second
fredegonda
the
victory
of
austerlitz
having
given
powerful
support
to
his
threats
the
fall
of
naples
was
decided
and
shortly
after
his
brother
joseph
was
seated
on
the
neapolitan
throne
at
length
came
the
grand
day
when
to
use
napoleon
expression
the
sun
of
austerlitz
rose
all
our
forces
were
concentrated
on
one
point
at
about
leagues
beyond
vienna
there
remained
nothing
but
the
wreck
of
the
austrian
army
the
corps
of
prince
charles
being
by
scientific
manoeuvres
kept
at
a
distance
from
the
line
of
operations
but
the
russians
alone
were
superior
to
us
in
numbers
and
their
army
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
fresh
troops
the
most
extraordinary
illusion
prevailed
in
the
enemy
camp
the
north
of
europe
has
its
gascons
as
well
as
the
south
of
france
and
the
junior
portion
of
the
russian
army
at
this
period
assumed
an
absurd
braggadocio
tone
on
the
very
eve
of
the
battle
the
emperor
alexander
sent
one
of
his
aides
de
camp
prince
dolgorouki
as
a
flag
of
truce
to
napoleon
the
prince
could
not
repress
his
even
in
the
presence
of
the
emperor
and
rapp
informed
me
that
on
dismissing
him
the
emperor
said
if
you
were
on
heights
of
montmartre
i
would
answer
such
impertinence
only
by
balls
this
observation
was
very
remarkable
inasmuch
as
subsequent
events
rendered
it
a
prophecy
as
to
the
battle
itself
i
can
describe
it
almost
as
well
as
if
i
had
witnessed
it
for
some
time
after
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
friend
rapp
who
was
sent
an
a
mission
to
prussia
he
gave
me
the
following
account
when
we
arrived
at
austerlitz
the
russians
were
not
aware
of
the
scientific
plans
which
the
emperor
had
laid
for
drawing
them
upon
the
ground
he
had
marked
out
and
seeing
our
advanced
guards
fall
back
before
theirs
they
already
considered
themselves
conquerors
they
supposed
that
their
guard
alone
would
secure
an
easy
triumph
but
the
action
commenced
and
they
experienced
an
energetic
resistance
on
all
points
at
one
the
victory
was
yet
uncertain
for
they
fought
admirably
they
wished
to
make
a
last
effort
by
directing
close
masses
against
our
centre
their
imperial
guard
deployed
their
artillery
cavalry
and
infantry
marched
upon
a
bridge
which
they
attacked
and
this
movement
which
was
concealed
by
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
ground
was
not
observed
by
napoleon
i
was
at
that
moment
near
the
emperor
awaiting
his
orders
we
heard
a
firing
of
musketry
the
russians
were
repulsing
one
of
our
brigades
the
emperor
ordered
me
to
take
some
of
the
mamelukes
two
squadrons
of
chasseurs
and
one
of
grenadiers
of
the
guard
and
to
go
and
reconnoitre
the
state
of
things
i
set
off
at
full
gallop
and
soon
discovered
the
disaster
the
russian
cavalry
had
penetrated
our
squares
and
was
sabring
our
men
i
perceived
in
the
distance
some
masses
of
cavalry
and
infantry
which
formed
the
reserve
of
the
russians
at
that
moment
the
enemy
advanced
to
meet
us
bringing
with
him
four
pieces
of
artillery
and
ranged
himself
in
order
of
battle
i
had
the
brave
morland
on
my
left
and
general
on
my
right
my
lads
exclaimed
i
to
my
troop
how
your
brothers
and
friends
are
being
cut
to
pieces
avenge
them
avenge
our
flag
forward
these
few
words
roused
my
men
we
advanced
as
swiftly
as
our
horses
could
carry
us
upon
the
artillery
which
was
taken
the
enemy
cavalry
which
awaited
us
firmly
was
repulsed
by
the
same
shock
and
fled
in
disorder
galloping
as
we
did
over
the
wrecks
of
our
squares
the
russians
rallied
but
a
squadron
of
horse
grenadiers
came
up
to
reinforce
me
and
thus
enabled
me
to
hold
ground
against
the
reserves
of
the
russian
guard
we
charged
again
and
this
charge
was
terrible
the
brave
morland
was
killed
by
my
side
it
was
downright
butchery
we
were
opposed
man
to
man
and
were
so
mingled
together
that
the
infantry
of
neither
one
nor
the
other
side
could
venture
to
fire
for
fear
of
killing
its
own
men
at
length
the
intrepidity
of
our
troops
overcame
every
obstacle
and
the
russians
fled
in
disorder
in
sight
of
the
two
emperors
of
russia
and
austria
who
had
stationed
themselves
on
a
height
in
order
to
witness
the
battle
they
saw
a
desperate
one
said
rapp
and
i
trust
they
were
satisfied
for
my
part
my
dear
friend
i
never
spent
so
glorious
a
day
what
a
reception
the
emperor
gave
me
when
i
returned
to
inform
him
that
we
had
won
the
battle
my
sword
was
broken
and
a
wound
which
i
received
on
my
head
was
bleeding
copiously
so
that
i
was
covered
with
blood
he
made
me
a
general
of
division
the
russians
did
not
return
to
the
charge
we
had
taken
all
their
cannon
and
baggage
and
prince
repnin
was
among
the
prisoners
thus
it
was
that
rapp
related
to
me
this
famous
battle
of
which
he
was
the
hero
as
kellerman
had
been
the
hero
of
marengo
what
now
remains
of
austerlitz
the
recollection
the
glory
and
the
magnificent
picture
of
gerard
the
idea
of
which
was
suggested
to
the
emperor
by
the
sight
of
rapp
with
the
blood
streaming
from
his
wound
i
can
not
forbear
relating
here
a
few
particulars
which
i
learned
from
rapp
respecting
his
mission
after
the
cure
of
his
wound
and
the
marriage
of
prince
eugene
to
the
princess
augusta
of
bavaria
the
friendship
which
rapp
cherished
for
me
was
of
the
most
sincere
kind
during
my
disgrace
he
did
not
even
conceal
it
from
napoleon
and
whoever
knows
anything
of
the
emperor
court
will
acknowledge
that
that
was
a
greater
mark
of
courage
than
the
carrying
of
a
redoubt
or
making
the
most
brilliant
charge
of
cavalry
rapp
possessed
courage
of
every
kind
an
excellent
heart
and
a
downright
frankness
which
for
a
time
brought
him
into
disgrace
with
napoleon
the
only
thing
for
which
rapp
could
be
reproached
was
his
extreme
prejudice
against
the
nobility
which
i
am
convinced
was
the
sole
reason
why
he
was
not
created
a
duke
the
emperor
made
him
a
count
because
he
wished
that
all
his
aides
de
camp
should
have
titles
he
had
been
a
fortnight
at
schoenbrunn
said
rapp
to
me
and
i
had
not
yet
resumed
my
duties
when
the
emperor
sent
for
me
he
asked
me
whether
i
was
able
to
travel
and
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
he
said
then
and
give
an
account
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
to
marmont
and
vex
him
for
not
having
been
at
it
i
set
off
and
in
conformity
with
the
instructions
i
had
received
from
the
emperor
i
proceeded
to
gratz
where
i
found
marmont
who
was
indeed
deeply
mortified
at
not
having
had
a
share
in
the
great
battle
i
told
him
as
the
emperor
had
directed
me
that
the
negotiations
were
commenced
but
that
nothing
was
yet
concluded
and
that
therefore
at
all
events
he
must
hold
himself
in
readiness
i
ascertained
the
situation
of
his
army
in
styria
and
the
amount
of
the
enemy
force
before
him
the
emperor
wished
him
to
send
a
number
of
spies
into
hungary
and
to
transmit
to
him
a
detailed
report
from
their
communications
i
next
proceeded
to
laybach
where
i
found
massena
at
the
head
of
the
eighth
corps
and
i
informed
him
that
the
emperor
wished
him
to
march
in
all
haste
upon
vienna
in
case
he
should
hear
of
the
rupture
of
the
negotiations
i
continued
the
itinerary
marked
out
for
me
until
i
reached
venice
and
thence
till
i
met
the
troops
of
carra
cyr
who
had
received
orders
to
march
back
upon
naples
as
soon
as
the
emperor
heard
of
the
treachery
of
the
king
of
naples
and
the
landing
of
the
english
and
russians
having
fulfilled
these
different
missions
i
proceeded
to
klagenfurth
where
i
saw
marshal
ney
and
i
afterwards
rejoined
the
emperor
at
munich
there
i
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
our
friends
assembled
and
among
them
josephine
still
as
affable
and
amiable
as
ever
how
delighted
i
was
when
an
my
arrival
i
learned
that
the
emperor
had
adopted
eugene
i
was
present
at
his
marriage
with
the
princess
augusta
of
bavaria
as
to
me
you
know
i
am
not
very
fond
of
fetes
and
the
emperor
might
have
dispensed
with
my
performing
the
duties
of
chamberlain
eugene
had
no
idea
of
what
was
going
on
when
the
emperor
sent
to
desire
his
presence
at
munich
with
all
possible
speed
he
too
remains
unchanged
he
is
still
our
old
comrade
at
first
he
was
not
much
pleased
with
the
idea
of
a
political
marriage
but
when
he
saw
his
bride
he
was
quite
enchanted
and
no
wonder
for
i
assure
you
she
is
a
very
charming
woman

at
the
moment
when
the
emperor
had
reason
to
hope
that
the
news
of
his
extraordinary
success
would
animate
public
spirit
he
was
informed
that
considerable
disquietude
prevailed
and
that
the
bank
of
france
was
assailed
by
demands
for
the
payment
of
its
paper
which
had
fallen
more
than
per
cent
i
was
not
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
this
decline
i
had
been
made
acquainted
through
the
commercial
correspondence
between
hamburg
and
paris
with
a
great
financial
operation
planned
by
ouvrard
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
to
obtain
piastres
from
spanish
america
at
a
price
much
below
the
real
value
and
i
had
learned
that
he
was
obliged
to
support
this
enterprise
by
the
funds
which
he
and
his
partners
previously
employed
in
victualling
the
forces
a
fresh
investment
of
capital
was
therefore
necessary
for
this
service
which
when
on
a
large
scale
requires
extensive
advances
and
the
tardy
payment
of
the
treasury
at
that
period
was
well
known
i
was
well
acquainted
with
ouvrard
and
in
what
i
am
about
to
say
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
found
anything
offensive
or
disagreeable
to
him
i
observed
the
greater
number
of
the
facts
to
which
i
shall
refer
in
their
origin
and
the
rest
i
learned
from
ouvrard
himself
who
when
he
visited
hamburg
in
communicated
to
me
a
variety
of
details
respecting
his
immense
transaction
with
the
king
of
spain
among
other
things
i
recollect
he
told
me
that
before
the
brumaire
he
was
possessed
of
without
owing
a
franc
to
any
person
this
celebrated
financier
has
been
the
object
of
great
public
attention
the
prodigious
variations
of
fortune
which
he
has
experienced
the
activity
of
his
life
the
immense
commercial
operations
in
which
he
has
been
engaged
the
extent
and
the
boldness
of
his
enterprises
render
it
necessary
in
forming
a
judgment
of
ouvrard
to
examine
his
conduct
with
due
care
and
deliberation
the
son
of
a
stationer
who
was
able
merely
through
his
own
resources
to
play
so
remarkable
a
part
could
be
no
ordinary
man
it
may
be
said
of
ouvrard
what
beaumarchais
said
of
himself
that
his
life
was
really
a
combat
i
have
known
him
long
and
i
saw
much
of
him
in
his
relations
with
josephine
he
always
appeared
to
me
to
possess
great
knowledge
of
the
world
accompanied
by
honourable
principles
and
a
high
degree
of
generosity
which
added
greatly
to
the
value
of
his
prudence
and
discretion
no
human
power
no
consideration
not
even
the
ingratitude
of
those
whom
he
had
obliged
could
induce
him
to
disclose
any
sacrifice
which
he
had
made
at
the
time
when
under
the
directory
the
public
revenue
may
be
said
to
have
been
always
at
the
disposal
of
the
highest
bidder
and
when
no
business
could
be
brought
to
a
conclusion
except
by
him
who
set
about
it
with
his
hands
full
of
money
to
this
security
with
which
ouvrard
impressed
all
official
persons
who
rendered
him
services
i
attribute
the
facility
with
which
be
obtained
the
direction
of
the
numerous
enterprises
in
which
he
engaged
and
which
produced
so
many
changes
in
his
fortune
the
discretion
of
ouvrard
was
not
quite
agreeable
to
the
first
consul
who
found
it
impossible
to
extract
from
him
the
information
he
wanted
he
tried
every
method
to
obtain
from
him
the
names
of
persons
to
whom
he
had
given
those
kind
of
subsidies
which
in
vulgar
language
are
called
sops
in
the
pan
and
by
ladies
pin
money
often
have
i
seen
bonaparte
resort
to
every
possible
contrivance
to
gain
his
object
he
would
sometimes
endeavour
to
alarm
ouvrard
by
menaces
and
at
other
times
to
flatter
him
by
promises
but
he
was
in
no
instance
successful
while
we
were
at
the
luxembourg
on
as
i
recollect
the
of
january
bonaparte
said
to
me
during
breakfast
bourrienne
my
resolution
is
taken
i
shall
have
ouvrard
arrested
general
have
you
proofs
against
him
proofs
indeed
he
is
a
a
monopoliser
we
must
make
him
disgorge
all
the
contractors
the
provision
agents
are
rogues
how
have
they
made
their
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
country
to
be
sure
i
will
not
suffer
such
doings
they
possess
millions
they
roll
in
an
insolent
luxury
while
my
soldiers
have
neither
bread
nor
shoes
i
will
have
no
more
of
that
i
intend
to
speak
on
the
business
in
the
council
and
we
shall
see
what
can
be
done
i
waited
with
impatience
for
his
return
from
the
council
to
know
what
had
passed
well
general
said
i
the
order
is
given
on
hearing
this
i
became
anxious
about
the
fate
of
ouvrard
who
was
thus
to
be
treated
more
like
a
subject
of
the
grand
turk
than
a
citizen
of
the
republic
but
i
soon
learned
that
the
order
had
not
been
executed
because
he
could
not
be
found
next
day
i
learned
that
a
person
whom
i
shall
not
name
who
was
present
at
the
council
and
who
probably
was
under
obligations
to
ouvrard
wrote
him
a
note
in
pencil
to
inform
him
of
the
vote
for
his
arrest
carried
by
the
first
consul
this
individual
stepped
out
for
a
moment
and
despatched
his
servant
with
the
note
to
ouvrard
having
thus
escaped
the
writ
of
arrest
ouvrard
after
a
few
days
had
passed
over
reappeared
and
surrendered
himself
prisoner
bonaparte
was
at
first
furious
on
learning
that
he
had
got
out
of
the
way
but
on
hearing
that
ouvrard
had
surrendered
himself
he
said
to
me
the
fool
he
does
not
know
what
is
awaiting
him
he
wishes
to
make
the
public
believe
that
he
has
nothing
to
fear
that
his
hands
are
clean
but
he
is
playing
a
bad
game
he
will
gain
nothing
in
that
way
with
me
all
talking
is
nonsense
you
may
be
sure
bourrienne
that
when
a
man
has
so
much
money
he
can
not
have
got
it
honestly
and
then
all
those
fellows
are
dangerous
with
their
fortunes
in
times
of
revolution
no
man
ought
to
have
more
than
francs
and
that
is
a
great
deal
too
much
before
going
to
prison
ouvrard
took
care
to
secure
against
all
the
searches
of
the
police
any
of
his
papers
which
might
have
committed
persons
with
whom
he
had
dealings
and
i
believe
that
there
were
individuals
connected
with
the
police
itself
who
had
good
reason
for
not
regretting
the
opportunity
which
ouvrard
had
taken
for
exercising
this
precaution
seals
however
were
put
upon
his
papers
but
on
examining
them
none
of
the
information
bonaparte
so
much
desired
to
obtain
was
found
nevertheless
on
one
point
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
for
on
looking
over
the
documents
he
found
from
some
of
them
that
madame
bonaparte
had
been
borrowing
money
from
ouvrard
as
ouvrard
had
a
great
number
of
friends
they
bestirred
themselves
to
get
some
person
of
influence
to
speak
to
the
first
consul
in
his
favour
but
this
was
a
commission
no
one
was
willing
to
undertake
because
prejudiced
as
bonaparte
was
the
least
hint
of
the
kind
would
have
appeared
to
him
to
be
dictated
by
private
interest
berthier
was
very
earnestly
urged
to
interfere
but
he
replied
that
is
impossible
he
would
say
that
it
was
underhand
work
to
get
money
for
madame
visconti
i
do
not
recollect
to
what
circumstance
ouvrard
was
indebted
for
his
liberty
but
it
is
certain
that
his
captivity
did
not
last
long
sometime
after
he
had
left
his
prison
bonaparte
asked
him
for
which
ouvrard
refused
on
his
accession
to
the
consulate
bonaparte
found
ouvrard
contractor
for
supplying
the
spanish
fleet
under
the
command
of
admiral
massaredo
this
business
introduced
him
to
a
correspondence
with
the
famous
godoy
prince
of
the
peace
the
contract
lasted
three
years
and
ouvrard
gained
by
it
a
net
profit
of
the
money
was
payable
in
piastres
at
the
rate
of
francs
and
some
centimes
each
though
the
piastre
was
really
worth
francs
centimes
but
to
recover
it
at
this
value
it
was
necessary
for
ouvrard
to
go
and
get
the
money
in
mexico
this
he
was
much
inclined
to
do
but
he
apprehended
some
obstacle
on
the
part
of
the
first
consul
and
notwithstanding
his
habitual
shrewdness
he
became
the
victim
of
his
on
his
application
de
talleyrand
undertook
to
ask
the
first
consul
for
authority
to
give
him
a
passport
i
was
in
the
cabinet
at
the
time
and
i
think
i
still
hear
the
dry
and
decided
no
which
was
all
the
answer
de
talleyrand
obtained
when
we
were
alone
the
first
consul
said
to
me
do
you
not
see
bourrienne
this
ouvrard
must
have
made
a
good
thing
of
his
business
with
the
prince
of
the
peace
but
the
fool
why
did
he
get
talleyrand
to
ask
me
for
a
passport
that
is
the
very
thing
that
raised
my
suspicion
why
did
he
not
apply
for
a
passport
as
every
one
else
does
have
i
the
giving
of
them
he
is
an
ass
so
much
the
worse
for
him
i
was
sorry
for
ouvrard
disappointment
and
i
own
none
the
less
so
because
he
had
intimated
his
willingness
to
give
me
a
share
in
the
business
he
was
to
transact
its
spain
and
which
was
likely
to
be
very
profitable
his
brother
went
to
mexico
in
his
stead
in
a
dreadful
scarcity
afflicted
france
ouvrard
took
upon
himself
in
concert
with
wanlerberghe
the
task
of
importing
foreign
grain
to
prevent
the
troubles
which
might
otherwise
have
been
expected
in
payment
of
the
grain
the
foreign
houses
who
sent
it
drew
upon
ouvrard
and
wanlerberghe
for
francs
in
treasury
bills
which
according
to
the
agreement
with
the
government
were
to
be
paid
but
when
the
bills
of
the
foreign
houses
became
due
there
was
no
money
in
the
treasury
and
payment
was
refused
after
six
months
had
elapsed
payment
was
offered
but
on
condition
that
the
government
should
retain
half
the
profit
of
the
commission
this
ouvrard
and
wanlerberghe
refused
upon
which
the
treasury
thought
it
most
economical
to
pay
nothing
and
the
debt
remained
unsettled
notwithstanding
this
transaction
ouvrard
and
wanlerberghe
engaged
to
victual
the
navy
which
they
supplied
for
six
years
and
three
months
after
the
completion
of
these
different
services
the
debt
due
to
them
amounted
to
in
consequence
of
the
long
delay
of
payment
by
the
treasury
the
disbursements
for
supplies
of
grain
amounted
at
least
to
more
than
and
the
difficulties
which
arose
had
a
serious
effect
on
the
credit
of
the
principal
dealers
with
those
persons
who
supplied
them
the
discredit
spread
and
gradually
reached
the
treasury
the
embarrassments
of
which
augmented
with
the
general
alarm
ouvrard
wanlerberghe
and
seguin
were
the
persons
whose
capital
and
credit
rendered
them
most
capable
of
relieving
the
treasury
and
they
agreed
to
advance
for
that
purpose
in
return
for
which
they
were
allowed
bonds
of
the
to
the
amount
of
desprez
undertook
to
be
the
medium
through
which
the
were
to
be
paid
into
the
treasury
and
the
three
partners
transferred
the
bands
to
him
spain
had
concluded
a
treaty
with
france
by
which
she
was
bound
to
pay
a
subsidy
of
francs
and
had
become
due
without
any
payment
being
made
it
was
thought
advisable
that
ouvrard
should
be
sent
to
madrid
to
obtain
a
settlement
but
he
was
afraid
that
his
business
in
paris
would
suffer
during
his
absence
and
especially
the
transaction
in
which
he
was
engaged
with
desprez
the
treasury
satisfied
him
on
this
point
by
agreeing
to
sanction
the
bargain
with
desprez
and
ouvrard
proceeded
to
madrid
it
was
on
this
occasion
he
entered
into
the
immense
speculation
for
trading
with
spanish
america
spain
wished
to
pay
the
which
were
due
to
france
as
soon
as
possible
but
her
coffers
were
empty
and
goodwill
does
not
ensure
ability
besides
in
addition
to
the
distress
of
the
government
there
was
a
dreadful
famine
in
spain
in
this
state
of
things
ouvrard
proposed
to
the
spanish
government
to
pay
the
debt
due
to
france
to
import
a
supply
of
corn
and
to
advance
funds
for
the
relief
of
the
spanish
treasury
for
this
he
required
two
conditions
the
exclusive
right
of
trading
with
america
the
right
of
bunging
from
america
on
his
own
account
all
the
specie
belonging
to
the
crown
with
the
power
of
making
loans
guaranteed
and
payable
by
the
spanish
treasuries
about
the
end
of
july
the
embarrassment
which
sometime
before
had
begun
to
be
felt
in
the
finances
of
europe
was
alarmingly
augmented
under
these
circumstances
it
was
obviously
the
interest
of
ouvrard
to
procure
payment
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
which
he
had
advanced
for
spain
to
the
french
treasury
he
therefore
redoubled
his
efforts
to
bring
his
negotiation
to
a
favourable
issue
and
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
a
deed
of
partnership
between
himself
and
charles
iv
which
contained
the
following
stipulation
ouvrard
and
company
are
authorised
to
introduce
into
the
ports
of
the
new
world
every
kind
of
merchandise
and
production
necessary
for
the
consumption
of
those
countries
and
to
export
from
the
spanish
colonies
during
the
continuance
of
the
war
with
england
all
the
productions
and
all
specie
derivable
from
them
this
treaty
was
only
to
be
in
force
during
the
war
with
england
and
it
was
stipulated
that
the
profits
arising
from
the
transactions
of
the
company
should
be
equally
divided
between
charles
iv
and
the
rest
of
the
company
that
is
to
say
to
the
king
and
the
other
half
to
his
partners
the
consequences
of
this
extraordinary
partnership
between
a
king
and
a
private
individual
remain
to
be
stated
on
the
signing
of
the
deed
ouvrard
received
drafts
from
the
treasury
of
madrid
to
the
extent
of
piastres
making
francs
but
the
piastres
were
to
be
brought
from
america
while
the
terms
of
the
treaty
required
that
the
urgent
wants
of
the
spanish
government
should
be
immediately
supplied
and
above
all
the
progress
of
the
famine
checked
to
accomplish
this
object
fresh
advances
to
an
enormous
amount
were
necessary
for
ouvrard
had
to
begin
by
furnishing
of
quintals
of
grain
at
the
rate
of
francs
the
quintal
besides
all
this
before
he
could
realise
a
profit
and
be
reimbursed
for
the
advances
he
had
made
to
the
treasury
of
paris
be
had
to
get
the
piastres
conveyed
from
america
to
europe
after
some
difficulty
the
english
government
consented
to
facilitate
the
execution
of
the
transaction
by
furnishing
four
frigates
for
the
conveyance
of
the
piastres
ouvrard
had
scarcely
completed
the
outline
of
his
extraordinary
enterprise
when
the
emperor
suddenly
broke
up
his
camp
at
boulogne
to
march
to
germany
it
will
readily
be
conceived
that
ouvrard
interests
then
imperatively
required
his
presence
at
madrid
but
he
was
recalled
to
paris
by
the
minister
of
the
treasury
who
wished
to
adjust
his
accounts
the
emperor
wanted
money
for
the
war
on
which
he
was
entering
and
to
procure
it
for
the
treasury
ouvrard
was
sent
to
amsterdam
to
negotiate
with
the
house
of
hope
he
succeeded
and
david
parish
became
the
company
agent
having
concluded
this
business
ouvrard
returned
in
all
haste
to
madrid
but
in
the
midst
of
the
most
flattering
hopes
and
most
gigantic
enterprises
he
suddenly
found
himself
threatened
with
a
dreadful
crisis
desprez
as
has
been
stated
had
with
the
concurrence
of
the
treasury
been
allowed
to
take
upon
himself
all
the
risk
of
executing
the
treaty
by
which
were
to
be
advanced
for
the
year
and
for
the
year
under
the
circumstances
which
had
arisen
the
minister
of
the
treasury
considered
himself
entitled
to
call
upon
ouvrard
to
place
at
his
disposal
of
the
piastres
which
he
had
received
from
spain
the
minister
at
the
same
time
informed
him
that
he
had
made
arrangements
on
the
faith
of
this
advance
which
he
thought
could
not
be
refused
at
so
urgent
a
moment
the
embarrassment
of
the
treasury
and
the
integrity
of
the
minister
de
barbe
marbois
induced
ouvrard
to
remit
the
piastres
but
a
few
days
after
he
had
forwarded
the
money
a
commissioner
of
the
treasury
arrived
at
madrid
with
a
ministerial
despatch
in
which
ouvrard
was
requested
to
deliver
to
the
commissioner
all
the
assets
he
could
command
and
to
return
immediately
to
paris
the
treasury
was
then
in
the
greatest
difficulty
and
a
general
alarm
prevailed
this
serious
financial
distress
was
occasioned
by
the
following
circumstances
the
treasury
had
by
a
circular
notified
to
the
that
desprez
was
the
holder
of
their
bonds
they
were
also
authorised
to
transmit
to
him
all
their
disposable
funds
to
be
placed
to
their
credit
in
an
account
current
perhaps
the
giving
of
this
authority
was
a
great
error
but
be
that
as
it
may
desprez
encouraged
by
the
complaisance
of
the
treasury
desired
the
to
transmit
to
him
all
the
sums
they
could
procure
for
payment
of
interest
under
per
promising
to
allow
them
a
higher
rate
of
interest
as
the
credit
of
the
house
of
desprez
stood
high
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
on
such
conditions
the
who
were
besides
secured
by
the
authority
of
the
treasury
would
enter
eagerly
into
the
proposed
plan
in
short
the
soon
transmitted
very
considerable
sums
chests
of
money
arrived
daily
from
every
point
of
france
intoxicated
by
this
success
desprez
engaged
in
speculations
which
in
his
situation
were
extremely
imprudent
he
lent
more
than
to
the
merchants
of
paris
which
left
him
no
command
of
specie
being
obliged
to
raise
money
he
deposited
with
the
bank
the
bonds
of
the
general
which
had
been
consigned
to
him
but
which
were
already
discharged
by
the
sums
transmitted
to
their
credit
in
the
account
current
the
bank
wishing
to
be
reimbursed
for
the
money
advanced
to
desprez
applied
to
the
whose
bonds
were
held
an
security
this
proceeding
had
become
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
bank
as
desprez
instead
of
making
his
payments
in
specie
sent
in
his
acceptances
the
directors
of
the
bank
who
conducted
that
establishment
with
great
integrity
and
discretion
began
to
be
alarmed
and
required
desprez
to
explain
the
state
of
his
affairs
the
suspicions
of
the
directors
became
daily
stronger
and
were
soon
shared
by
the
public
at
last
the
bank
was
obliged
to
stop
payment
and
its
notes
were
soon
at
a
discount
of
per
cent
the
minister
of
the
treasury
dismayed
as
well
may
be
supposed
at
such
a
state
of
things
during
the
emperor
absence
convoked
a
council
at
which
joseph
bonaparte
presided
and
to
which
desprez
and
wanlerberghe
were
summoned
ouvrard
being
informed
of
this
financial
convulsion
made
all
possible
haste
from
madrid
and
on
his
arrival
at
paris
sought
assistance
from
amsterdam
hope
house
offered
to
take
piastres
at
the
rate
of
francs
centimes
each
ouvrard
having
engaged
to
pay
the
spanish
government
only
francs
would
very
willingly
have
parted
with
them
at
that
rate
but
his
hasty
departure
from
madrid
and
the
financial
events
at
paris
affected
his
relations
with
the
spanish
treasury
and
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
afford
any
support
to
the
treasury
of
france
thus
the
alarm
continued
until
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
and
the
consequent
hope
of
peace
tranquillised
the
public
mind
the
bankruptcy
of
desprez
was
dreadful
it
was
followed
by
the
failure
of
many
houses
the
credit
of
which
was
previously
undoubted
to
temper
the
exultation
which
victory
was
calculated
to
excite
the
news
of
the
desperate
situation
of
the
treasury
and
the
bank
reached
the
emperor
on
the
day
after
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
alarming
accounts
which
he
received
hastened
his
return
to
france
and
on
the
very
evening
on
which
he
arrived
in
paris
he
pronounced
while
ascending
the
stairs
of
the
tuileries
the
dismissal
of
de
barbs
marbois
this
minister
had
made
numerous
enemies
by
the
strict
discharge
of
his
duty
and
yet
notwithstanding
his
rigid
probity
he
sunk
under
the
accusation
of
having
endangered
the
safety
of
the
state
by
weakness
of
character
at
this
period
even
madame
de
stael
said
in
a
party
where
the
firmness
of
barbs
marbois
was
the
topic
of
conversation
what
he
inflexible
he
is
only
a
reed
bronzed
but
whatever
may
be
the
opinion
entertained
of
the
character
of
this
minister
it
is
certain
that
napoleon
rage
against
him
was
unbounded
such
was
the
financial
catastrophe
which
occurred
during
the
campaign
of
vienna
but
all
was
not
over
with
ouvrard
and
in
so
great
a
confusion
of
affairs
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
imperial
hand
which
was
not
always
the
hand
of
justice
should
not
make
itself
somewhere
felt
in
the
course
of
the
month
of
february
the
emperor
issued
two
decrees
in
which
he
declared
ouvrard
wanlerberghe
and
michel
contractors
for
the
service
of
and
desprez
their
agent
debtors
to
the
amount
of
which
they
had
misapplied
in
private
speculations
and
in
transactions
with
spain
for
their
personal
interests
who
would
not
suppose
from
this
phrase
that
napoleon
had
taken
no
part
whatever
in
the
great
financial
operation
between
spain
and
south
america
he
was
however
intimately
acquainted
with
it
and
was
himself
really
and
personally
interested
but
whenever
any
enterprise
was
unsuccessful
he
always
wished
to
deny
all
connection
with
it
possessed
of
made
up
by
himself
that
is
to
say
his
own
decrees
the
emperor
seized
all
the
piastres
and
other
property
belonging
to
the
company
and
derived
from
the
transaction
great
pecuniary
advantage
though
such
advantage
never
could
be
regarded
by
a
sovereign
as
any
compensation
for
the
dreadful
state

the
public

because
there
was
no
more

between
the
reports
which
i
received
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
than
there
is
in
the
pleading
of
the
barristers
who
succeed
each
other
in
a
court
of
justice
on
the
of
january
i
learned
that
many
houses
in
hamburg
had
received
by
post
packets
each
containing
four
copies
of
a
declaration
of
louis
xviii
dumouriez
had
his
carriage
filled
with
copies
of
this
declaration
when
he
passed
through
brunswick
and
in
that
small
town
alone
more
than
were
distributed
the
size
of
this
declaration
rendered
its
transmission
by
post
very
easy
even
in
france
all
my
letters
from
the
minister
recommended
that
i
should
keep
a
strict
watch
over
the
motions
of
dumouriez
but
his
name
was
now
as
seldom
mentioned
as
if
he
had
ceased
to
exist
the
part
he
acted
seemed
to
be
limited
to
disseminating
pamphlets
more
or
less
insignificant
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
the
great
courage
and
presence
of
mind
sometimes
found
in
men
so
degraded
as
are
the
wretches
who
fill
the
office
of
spies
i
had
an
agent
amongst
the
named
chefneux
whom
i
had
always
found
extremely
clever
and
correct
having
for
a
long
time
received
no
intelligence
from
him
i
became
very
anxious
an
anxiety
which
was
not
without
foundation
he
had
in
fact
been
arrested
at
lauenburg
and
conducted
bound
tied
hand
and
foot
by
some
cossacks
to
luneburg
there
was
found
on
him
a
bulletin
which
he
was
about
to
transmit
to
me
and
he
only
escaped
certain
death
by
having
in
his
possession
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
a
hamburg
merchant
well
known
to
alopaeus
the
russian
minister
in
that
city
this
precaution
which
i
had
taken
before
he
set
out
saved
his
life
alopaeus
replied
to
the
merchant
that
in
consequence
of
his
recommendation
the
spy
should
be
sent
back
safe
and
sound
but
that
another
time
neither
the
recommended
nor
the
recommender
should
escape
so
easily
notwithstanding
this
chefneux
would
certainly
have
paid
with
his
head
for
the
dangerous
business
in
which
he
was
embarked
but
for
the
inconceivable
coolness
he
displayed
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
though
the
bulletin
which
was
found
upon
him
was
addressed
to
schramm
merchant
they
strongly
suspected
that
it
was
intended
for
me
they
demanded
of
the
prisoner
whether
he
knew
me
to
which
he
boldly
replied
that
he
had
never
seen
me
they
endeavoured
by
every
possible
means
to
extort
a
confession
from
him
but
without
success
his
repeated
denials
joined
to
the
name
of
schramm
created
doubts
in
the
minds
of
his
interrogators
they
hesitated
lest
they
should
condemn
an
innocent
man
they
however
resolved
to
make
a
last
effort
to
discover
the
truth
and
chefneux
condemned
to
be
shot
was
conducted
to
the
plain
of
luneburg
his
eyes
were
bandaged
and
he
heard
the
command
of
preparation
given
to
the
platoon
which
was
to
fire
upon
him
at
that
moment
a
man
approaching
him
whispered
in
his
ear
in
a
tone
of
friendship
and
compassion
they
are
going
to
fire
but
i
am
your
friend
only
acknowledge
that
you
know
de
bourrienne
and
you
are
safe
no
replied
chefneux
in
a
firm
tone
if
i
said
so
i
should
tell
a
falsehood
immediately
the
bandage
was
removed
from
his
eyes
and
he
was
set
at
liberty
it
would
be
difficult
to
cite
a
more
extraordinary
instance
of
presence
of
mind
much
as
i
execrate
the
system
of
espionage
i
am
nevertheless
compelled
to
admit
that
the
emperor
was
under
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
most
unremitting
vigilance
amidst
the
intrigues
which
were
going
forward
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hamburg
especially
when
the
english
swedes
and
russians
were
in
arms
and
there
were
the
strongest
grounds
for
suspecting
the
sincerity
of
prussia
on
the
of
january
the
king
of
sweden
arrived
before
the
gates
of
hamburg
the
senate
of
that
city
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
english
swedish
and
russian
troops
determined
to
send
a
deputation
to
congratulate
the
swedish
monarch
who
however
hesitated
so
long
about
receiving
this
homage
that
fears
were
entertained
lest
his
refusal
should
be
followed
by
some
act
of
aggression
at
length
however
the
deputies
were
admitted
and
they
returned
sufficiently
well
satisfied
with
their
reception
the
king
of
sweden
then
officially
declared
that
all
the
arrangements
entered
into
with
relation
to
hanover
had
no
reference
to
hint
as
the
swedish
army
was
under
the
immediate
command
of
its
august
sovereign
the
king
with
his
men
seemed
inclined
to
play
the
part
of
the
restorer
of
germany
and
to
make
himself
the
don
quixote
of
the
treaty
of
westphalia
he
threatened
the
senate
of
hamburg
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
anger
because
on
my
application
the
colours
which
used
to
be
suspended
over
the
door
of
the
house
for
receiving
austrian
recruits
had
been
removed
the
poor
senate
of
hamburg
was
kept
in
constant
alarm
by
so
dangerous
a
neighbour
the
king
of
sweden
had
his
headquarters
at
boetzenburg
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
elbe
in
order
to
amuse
himself
he
sent
for
gall
who
was
at
hamburg
where
he
delivered
lectures
on
his
system
of
phrenology
which
was
rejected
in
the
beginning
by
false
science
and
prejudice
and
afterwards
adopted
in
consequence
of
arguments
in
my
opinion
unanswerable
i
had
the
pleasure
of
living
some
time
with
gall
and
i
owe
to
the
intimacy
which
subsisted
between
us
the
honour
he
conferred
on
me
by
the
dedication
of
one
of
his
works
i
said
to
him
when
he
departed
for
the
headquarters
of
the
king
of
sweden
my
dear
doctor
you
will
certainly
discover
the
bump
of
vanity
the
truth
is
that
had
the
doctor
at
that
period
been
permitted
to
examine
the
heads
of
the
sovereigns
of
europe
they
would
have
afforded
very
curious
craniological
studies
it
was
not
the
king
of
sweden
alone
who
gave
uneasiness
to
hamburg
the
king
of
prussia
threatened
to
seize
upon
that
city
and
his
minister
publicly
declared
that
it
would
very
soon
belong
to
his
master
the
hamburgers
were
deeply
afflicted
at
this
threat
in
fact
next
to
the
loss
of
their
independence
their
greatest
misfortune
would
have
been
to
fall
under
the
dominion
of
prussia
as
the
niggardly
fiscal
system
of
the
prussian
government
at
that
time
would
have
proved
extremely
detrimental
to
a
commercial
city
hanover
being
evacuated
by
the
french
troops
had
become
a
kind
of
recruiting
mart
for
the
british
army
where
every
man
who
presented
himself
was
enrolled
to
complete
the
hanoverian
legion
which
was
then
about
to
be
embodied
the
english
scattered
gold
by
handfuls
one
hundred
and
fifty
carriages
each
with
six
horses
were
employed
in
this
service
which
confirmed
me
in
the
belief
i
had
previously
entertained
that
the
english
were
to
join
with
the
russians
in
an
expedition
against
holland
the
aim
of
the
was
to
make
a
diversion
which
might
disconcert
the
movements
of
the
french
armies
in
germany
the
allies
being
at
that
time
unacquainted
with
the
peace
concluded
at
presburg
not
a
moment
was
therefore
to
be
lost
in
uniting
the
whole
of
our
disposable
force
for
the
defence
of
holland
but
it
is
not
of
this
expedition
that
i
mean
to
speak
at
present
i
only
mention
it
to
afford
some
idea
of
our
situation
at
hamburg
surrounded
as
we
then
were
by
swedish
english
and
russian
troops
at
this
period
the
russian
minister
at
hamburg
forshmann
became
completely
insane
his
conduct
had
been
more
injurious
than
advantageous
to
his
government
he
was
replaced
by
alopcous
the
russian
minister
at
berlin
and
they
could
not
have
exchanged
a
fool
for
a
more
judicious
and
able
diplomatist
i
often
received
from
the
minister
of
marine
letters
said
packets
to
transmit
to
the
isle
of
france
mauritius
of
which
the
emperor
was
extremely
anxious
to
retain
possession
and
i
had
much
trouble
in
finding
any
vessels
prepared
for
that
colony
by
which
i
could
forward
the
minister
communications
the
death
of
pitt
and
the
appointment
of
fox
as
his
successor
had
created
a
hope
of
peace
it
was
universally
known
that
fox
in
succeeding
to
his
office
did
not
inherit
the
furious
hatred
of
the
deceased
minister
against
france
and
her
emperor
there
moreover
existed
between
napoleon
and
fox
a
reciprocal
esteem
and
the
latter
had
shown
himself
really
disposed
to
treat
the
possibility
of
concluding
a
peace
had
always
been
maintained
by
that
statesman
when
he
was
in
opposition
to
pitt
and
bonaparte
himself
might
have
been
induced
from
the
high
esteem
he
felt
for
fox
to
make
concessions
from
which
he
would
before
have
recoiled
but
there
were
two
obstacles
i
may
say
almost
insurmountable
ones
the
first
was
the
conviction
on
the
part
of
england
that
any
peace
which
might
be
made
would
only
be
a
truce
and
that
bonaparte
would
never
seriously
relinquish
his
desire
of
universal
dominion
on
the
other
side
it
was
believed
that
napoleon
had
formed
the
design
of
invading
england
had
he
been
able
to
do
so
it
would
have
been
less
with
the
view
of
striking
a
blow
at
her
commerce
and
destroying
her
maritime
power
than
of
annihilating
the
liberty
of
the
press
which
he
had
extinguished
in
his
own
dominions
the
spectacle
of
a
free
people
separated
only
by
six
leagues
of
sea
was
according
to
him
a
seductive
example
to
the
french
especially
to
those
among
them
who
bent
unwillingly
under
his
yoke
at
an
early
period
of
fox
ministry
a
frenchman
made
the
proposition
to
him
of
assassinating
the
emperor
of
which
information
was
immediately
transmitted
to
de
talleyrand
in
this
despatch
the
minister
said
that
though
the
laws
of
england
did
not
authorise
the
permanent
detention
of
any
individual
not
convicted
of
a
crime
he
had
on
this
occasion
taken
it
on
himself
to
secure
the
miscreant
till
such
time
as
the
french
government
could
be
put
on
its
guard
against
his
attempts
fox
said
in
his
letter
that
he
had
at
first
done
this
individual
the
honour
to
take
him
for
a
spy
a
phrase
which
sufficiently
indicated
the
disgust
with
which
the
british
minister
viewed
him
this
information
was
the
key
which
opened
the
door
to
new
negotiations
de
talleyrand
was
ordered
to
express
in
reply
to
the
communication
of
fox
that
the
emperor
was
sensibly
affected
at
the
index
it
afforded
of
the
principles
by
which
the
british
cabinet
was
actuated
napoleon
did
not
limit
himself
to
this
diplomatic
courtesy
he
deemed
it
a
favourable
occasion
to
create
a
belief
that
he
was
actuated
by
a
sincere
love
of
peace
he
summoned
to
paris
lord
yarmouth
one
of
the
most
distinguished
amongst
the
english
who
had
been
so
unjustly
detained
prisoners
at
verdun
on
the
rupture
of
the
peace
of
amiens
he
gave
his
lordship
instructions
to
propose
to
the
british
government
a
new
form
of
negotiations
offering
to
guarantee
to
england
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
malta
some
have
been
inclined
from
this
concession
to
praise
the
moderation
of
bonaparte
others
to
blame
him
for
offering
to
resign
these
two
places
as
if
the
cape
and
malta
could
be
put
in
competition
with
the
title
of
emperor
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
italy
the
acquisition
of
genoa
and
of
all
the
venetian
states
the
dethronement
of
the
king
of
naples
and
the
gift
of
his
kingdom
to
joseph
and
finally
the
new
partition
of
germany
these
transactions
of
which
bonaparte
said
not
a
word
and
from
which
he
certainly
had
no
intention
of
departing
were
all
long
after
the
treaty
of
amiens
every
day
brought
with
it
fresh
proofs
of
insatiable
ambition
in
fact
napoleon
longed
to
obtain
possession
of
the
hanse
towns
i
was
however
in
the
first
place
merely
charged
to
make
overtures
to
the
senates
of
each
of
these
towns
and
to
point
out
the
advantages
they
would
derive
from
the
protection
of
napoleon
in
exchange
for
the
small
sacrifice
of
francs
in
his
favour
i
had
on
this
subject
numerous
conferences
with
the
magistrates
they
thought
the
sum
too
great
representing
to
me
that
the
city
was
not
so
rich
as
formerly
because
their
commerce
had
been
much
curtailed
by
the
war
in
short
the
senate
declared
that
with
the
utmost
goodwill
their
circumstances
would
not
permit
them
to
accept
the
generous
proposal
of
the
emperor
i
was
myself
indeed
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
the
absurdity
of
employing
me
to
make
such
a
proposition
was
overlooked
for
i
had
really
no
advantage
to
offer
in
return
to
the
hanse
towns
against
whom
did
bonaparte
propose
to
protect
them
the
truth
is
napoleon
then
wished
to
seize
these
towns
by
direct
aggression
which
however
he
was
not
able
to
accomplish
until
four
years
afterwards
during
five
years
i
witnessed
the
commercial
importance
of
these
cities
and
especially
of
hamburg
its
geographical
situation
on
a
great
river
navigable
by
large
vessels
to
the
city
thirty
leagues
from
the
mouth
of
the
elbe
the
complete
independence
it
enjoyed
its
municipal
regulations
and
paternal
government
were
a
few
amongst
the
many
causes
which
had
raised
hamburg
to
its
enviable
height
of
prosperity
what
in
fact
was
the
population
of
these
remnants
of
the
grand
hanseatic
league
of
the
middle
ages
the
population
of
hamburg
when
i
was
there
amounted
to
and
that
of
its
small
surrounding
territory
to
bremen
had
inhabitants
and
in
its
territory
the
city
of
lubeck
which
is
smaller
and
its
territory
a
little
more
extensive
than
that
of
bremen
contained
a
population
of
souls
within
and
without
the
walls
thus
the
total
population
of
the
hanse
towns
amounted
to
only
individuals
and
yet
this
handful
of
men
carried
on
an
extensive
commerce
and
their
ships
ploughed
every
sea
from
the
shores
of
india
to
the
frozen
regions
of
greenland
the
emperor
arrived
at
paris
towards
the
end
of
january
having
created
kings
in
germany
he
deemed
the
moment
favourable
for
surrounding
his
throne
with
new
princes
it
was
at
this
period
that
he
created
murat
grand
duke
of
cleves
and
berg
bernadotte
prince
of
de
talleyrand
duke
of
benevento
and
his
two
former
colleagues
cambaceres
and
lebrun
dukes
of
parma
and
piacenza
he
also
gave
to
his
sister
pauline
a
short
time
after
her
second
marriage
with
the
prince
borghese
the
title
of
duchess
of
guastalla
strange
events
who
could
then
have
foreseen
that
the
duchy
of
cambaceres
would
become
the
refuge
of
a
princess
of
austria
the
widowed
wife
of
napoleon
bonaparte
in
the
midst
of
the
prosperity
of
the
imperial
family
when
the
eldest
of
the
emperor
brothers
had
ascended
the
throne
of
naples
when
holland
was
on
the
eve
of
being
offered
to
louis
and
jerome
had
exchanged
his
legitimate
wife
for
the
illegitimate
throne
of
westphalia
the
imperial
pillow
was
still
far
from
being
free
from
anxiety
hostilities
did
not
actually
exist
with
the
continental
powers
but
this
momentary
state
of
repose
lacked
the
tranquillity
of
peace
france
was
at
war
with
russia
and
england
and
the
aspect
of
the
continent
presented
great
uncertainty
while
the
treaty
of
vienna
had
only
been
executed
in
part
in
the
meantime
napoleon
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
east
general
sebastiani
was
sent
to
constantinople
the
measures
be
pursued
and
his
judicious
conduct
justified
the
choice
of
the
emperor
he
was
adroit
and
conciliating
and
peace
with
turkey
was
the
result
of
his
mission
the
negotiations
with
england
did
not
terminate
so
happily
although
after
the
first
overtures
made
to
lord
yarmouth
the
earl
of
lauderdale
had
been
sent
to
paris
by
fox
in
fact
these
negotiations
wholly
failed
the
emperor
had
drawn
enormous
sums
from
austria
without
counting
the
vases
statues
and
pictures
with
which
he
decorated
the
louvre
and
the
bronze
with
which
he
clothed
the
column
of
the
place
vendome
in
my
opinion
the
finest
monument
of
his
reign
and
the
most
beautiful
one
in
paris
as
austria
was
exhausted
all
the
contributions
imposed
on
her
could
not
be
paid
in
cash
and
they
gave
the
emperor
bills
in
payment
i
received
one
for
about
on
hamburg
on
account
of
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
presburg
the
affairs
of
the
bourbon
princes
became
more
and
more
unfavourable
and
their
finances
as
well
as
their
chances
of
success
were
so
much
diminished
that
about
this
period
it
was
notified
to
the
emigrants
in
brunswick
that
the
pretender
louis
xviii
had
no
longer
the
means
of
continuing
their
pensions
this
produced
great
consternation
amongst
those
emigrants
many
of
whom
had
no
other
means
of
existence
and
notwithstanding
their
devotion
to
the
cause
of
royalty
they
found
a
pension
very
useful
in
strengthening
their
zeal
when
louis
xviii
returned
to
france
and
fouche
was
his
minister
of
police
the
king
asked
fouche
whether
during
his
the
king
exile
had
not
set
spies
over
him
and
who
they
were
fouche
hesitated
to
reply
but
the
king
insisting
he
said
if
your
majesty
presses
for
an
answer
it
was
the
due
de
blacas
to
whom
this
matter
was
confided
and
how
much
did
you
pay
him
said
the
king
deux
cents
mille
livres
de
rents
sire
ah
so
said
the
king
then
he
has
played
fair
we
went
halves
henry
greville
diary
p
amongst
those
emigrants
was
one
whose
name
will
occupy
a
certain
place
in
history
i
mean
dumouriez
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
who
had
for
some
time
employed
himself
in
distributing
pamphlets
he
was
then
at
stralsund
and
it
was
believed
that
the
king
of
sweden
would
give
him
a
command
the
vagrant
life
of
this
general
who
ran
everywhere
begging
employment
from
the
enemies
of
his
country
without
being
able
to
obtain
it
subjected
him
to
general
ridicule
in
fact
he
was
everywhere
despised
to
determine
the
difficulties
which
had
arisen
with
regard
to
holland
which
dumouriez
dreamed
of
conquering
with
an
imaginary
army
and
being
discontented
besides
with
the
dutch
for
not
rigorously
excluding
english
vessels
from
their
ports
the
emperor
constituted
the
batavian
territory
a
kingdom
under
his
brother
louis
when
i
notified
to
the
states
of
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
the
accession
of
louis
bonaparte
to
the
throne
of
holland
and
the
nomination
of
cardinal
fesch
as
coadjutor
and
successor
of
the
of
the
germanic
empire
along
with
their
official
communications
the
duke
of
was
the
only
member
of
the
circle
who
forebore
to
reply
and
i
understood
be
had
applied
to
the
court
of
russia
to
know
whether
and
how
he
should
reply
at
the
same
time
he
made
known
to
the
emperor
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
the
princess
charlotte
frederica
with
prince
christian
frederick
of
denmark
at
this
period
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
foresee
the
way
in
which
this
union
would
terminate
the
prince
was
young
and
handsome
and
of
an
amiable
disposition
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
would
prove
a
good
husband
as
for
the
princess
she
was
as
beautiful
as
love
but
she
was
heedless
and
giddy
in
fact
she
was
a
spoiled
child
she
adored
her
husband
and
during
several
years
their
union
proved
happy
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
them
at
the
period
when
the
duke
of
mecklenburg
with
his
family
sought
refuge
at
altona
before
leaving
that
town
the
duchess
of
mecklenburg
a
princess
of
saxony
paid
a
visit
to
madame
de
bourrienne
and
loaded
her
with
civilities
this
princess
was
perfectly
amiable
and
was
therefore
generally
regretted
when
two
years
afterwards
death
snatched
her
from
her
family
before
leaving
altona
the
duke
of
mecklenburg
gave
some
parties
by
way
of
bidding
adieu
to
holstein
where
he
had
been
so
kindly
received
and
i
can
never
forget
the
distinguished
reception
and
many
kindnesses
madame
de
bourrienne
and
myself
received
from
that
illustrious
family
it
consisted
of
the
hereditary
prince
so
distinguished
by
his
talents
and
acquirements
he
was
at
that
time
the
widower
of
a
grand
duchess
of
russia
a
sister
of
the
emperor
alexander
of
prince
gustavus
so
amiable
and
graceful
and
of
princess
charlotte
and
her
husband
the
prince
royal
of
denmark
this
happy
couple
were
far
from
foreseeing
that
in
two
years
they
would
be
separated
for
ever
the
princess
was
at
this
period
in
all
the
splendour
of
her
beauty
several
fetes
were
given
on
her
account
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
at
which
the
prince
always
opened
the
ball
with
madame
de
bourrienne
notwithstanding
her
amiability
the
princess
charlotte
was
no
favourite
at
the
danish
court
intrigues
were
formed
against
her
i
know
not
whether
any
foundation
existed
for
the
calumnies
spread
to
her
disadvantage
but
the
court
dames
accused
her
of
great
levity
of
conduct
which
true
or
false
obliged
her
husband
to
separate
from
her
and
at
the
commencement
of
he
sent
her
to
altona
attended
by
a
chamberlain
and
a
maid
of
honour
on
her
arrival
she
was
in
despair
hers
was
not
a
silent
grief
for
she
related
her
story
to
every
one
this
unfortunate
woman
really
attracted
pity
as
she
shed
tears
for
her
son
three
years
of
age
whom
she
was
doomed
never
again
to
behold
but
her
natural
levity
returned
she
did
not
always
maintain
the
reserve
suitable
to
her
rank
and
some
months
afterwards
was
sent
into
jutland
where
i
believe
she
still
lives
the
enemies
of
the
french
government
did
not
confine
themselves
to
writing
and
publishing
invectives
against
it
more
than
one
wretch
was
ready
to
employ
daggers
against
the
emperor
among
this
number
was
a
man
named
louis
loizeau
recently
arrived
from
london
he
repaired
to
altona
there
to
enjoy
the
singular
privilege
which
that
city
afforded
of
sheltering
all
the
ruffians
thieves
and
bankrupts
who
fled
from
the
justice
of
their
own
governments
on
the
of
july
loizeau
presented
himself
to
comte
de
gimel
who
resided
at
altona
as
the
agent
of
the
comte
de
lille
he
offered
to
repair
to
paris
and
assassinate
the
emperor
comte
de
gimel
rejected
the
proposal
with
indignation
and
replied
that
if
he
had
no
other
means
of
serving
the
bourbons
than
cowardly
assassination
he
might
go
elsewhere
and
find
confederates
this
fact
which
was
communicated
to
me
by
a
friend
of
de
gimel
determined
me
to
arrest
loizeau
not
being
warranted
however
to
take
this
step
at
altona
i
employed
a
trusty
agent
to
keep
watch
and
draw
him
into
a
quarrel
the
moment
he
should
appear
on
the
hamburg
side
of
a
public
walk
which
divides
that
city
from
altona
and
deliver
him
up
to
the
nearest
hamburg
loizeau
fell
into
the
snare
but
finding
that
he
was
about
to
be
conducted
from
the
guardhouse
to
the
prison
of
hamburg
and
that
it
was
at
my
request
he
had
been
arrested
he
hastily
unloosed
his
cravat
and
tore
with
his
teeth
the
papers
it
contained
part
of
which
he
swallowed
he
also
endeavoured
to
tear
some
other
papers
which
were
concealed
under
his
arm
but
was
prevented
by
the
guard
furious
at
this
disappointment
he
violently
resisted
the
five
soldiers
who
had
him
in
custody
and
was
not
secured
until
he
had
been
slightly
wounded
his
first
exclamation
on
entering
prison
was
i
am
undone
loizeau
was
removed
to
paris
and
though
i
am
ignorant
of
the
ultimate
fate
of
this
wretch
i
am
pretty
certain
that
fouche
would
take
effectual
means
to
prevent
him
from
doing
any
further
mischief

and
in

as
the

of

diminished
prussia
redoubled
her
threats
which
were
inspired
by
the
recollection
of
the
deeds
of
the
great
frederick
the
idea
of
peace
was
hateful
to
prussia
her
measures
which
till
now
had
been
sufficiently
moderate
suddenly
assumed
a
menacing
aspect
on
learning
that
the
minister
of
the
king
of
england
had
declared
in
parliament
that
france
had
consented
to
the
restitution
of

the

intimated
to
the

government
that
this
was
a
preliminary
step
towards
a
general
peace
and
that
a
large
indemnity
would
be
granted
in

but
the
king
of

who
was
well
informed
and
convinced
that
the
house
of
hanover
clung
to
this
ancient
domain
which
gave
to
england
a
certain
preponderance
in
germany
considered
himself
trifled
with
and
determined
on
war
under
these
circumstances
lord
lauderdale
was
recalled
from

by
his
government
war
continued
with
england
and
was
about

commence

prussia
the
cabinet
of
berlin
sent
an
ultimatum
which
could
scarcely
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
than
a
defiance
and
from
the
character
of
napoleon
we
may
judge
of
his
irritation
at
this
ultimatum
the
severity
with
which
bonaparte
treated
the
press
may
be
inferred
from
the
case
of

that
it
was
not
until
the
arrival
of

on

the

dangerously
wounded
at

at
this
prince
was
in
the
year
of
his
age
and
extremely
infirm
his
entrance
into
that
city
afforded
a
striking
example
of
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
that
prince
entered
altona
on
a
wretched
litter
borne
by
ten
men
without
officers
without
domestics
followed
by
a
troop
of
vagabonds
and
children
who
were
drawn
together
by
curiosity
he
was
lodged
in
a
wretched
inn
and
so
much
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
the
pain
of
his
eyes
that
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
a
report
of
his
death
very
generally
prevailed
doctor
unzer
was
immediately
sent
for
to
attend
the
unfortunate
duke
who
during
the
few
days
that
he
survived
his
wounds
saw
no
one
else
except
his
wife
who
arrived
on
the
of
november
he
expired
on
the
of
the
same
month
for
the
mistimed
but
rather
pathetic
belief
of
the
old
dying
duke
in
the
courtesy
with
which
he
and
his
states
would
be
treated
by
the
french
see
beugnot
tome
i
feel
sure
that
there
is
a
courier
of
the
emperor
on
the
road
to
know
how
i
am
at
this
juncture
bernadotte
returned
to
hamburg
i
asked
him
how
i
was
to
account
for
his
conduct
while
he
was
with
davoust
who
had
left
nuremberg
to
attack
the
prussian
army
and
whether
it
was
true
that
he
had
refused
to
march
with
that
general
and
afterwards
to
aid
him
when
he
attacked
the
prussians
on
the
weimar
road
the
letters
i
received
observed
i
state
that
you
took
no
part
in
the
battle
of
auerstadt
that
i
did
not
believe
but
i
suppose
you
saw
the
bulletin
which
i
received
a
little
after
the
battle
and
which
stated
that
bonaparte
said
at
nuremberg
in
the
presence
of
several
officers
i
to
bring
him
before
a
he
would
be
shot
i
shall
say
nothing
to
him
about
it
but
i
will
take
care
he
shall
know
what
i
think
of
his
behaviour
he
has
too
keen
a
sense
of
honour
not
to
be
aware
that
he
acted
disgracefully
i
think
him
very
likely
rejoined
bernadotte
to
have
made
these
observations
he
hates
me
because
he
knows
i
do
not
like
him
but
let
him
speak
to
me
and
he
shall
have
his
answer
if
i
am
a
gascon
he
is
a
greater
one
i
might
have
felt
piqued
at
receiving
something
like
orders
from
davoust
but
i
did
my
duty
the
complaints
of
bernadotte
conduct
on
the
of
october
when
he
gave
no
assistance
to
davoust
in
repulsing
the
main
body
of
the
prussians
at
aneratadt
are
well
known
jomini
says
that
davoust
proposed
to
bernadotte
to
march
with
him
and
even
offered
him
the
command
of
the
two
corps
bernadotte
refused
and
marched
away
to
dornburg
where
he
was
of
no
use
his
obstinacy
difficult
to
explain
nearly
compromised
both
davoust
and
the
success
of
the
battle
see
also
thiers
tome
vii
who
attributes
bernadotte
conduct
to
a
profound
aversion
for
davoust
conceived
on
the
most
frivolous
grounds
bernadotte
had
frequently
given
cause
of
complaint
to
napoleon
in
the
two
campaigns
of
and
in
the
movement
on
vienna
napoleon
considered
he
showed
want
of
activity
and
of
zeal
these
complaints
seem
to
have
been
made
in
good
faith
for
in
a
letter
to
bernadotte
joseph
napoleon
suggests
that
health
may
have
been
the
causes
du
cases
tome
bernadotte
was
equally
unfortunate
in
putting
in
his
appearance
too
late
at
eylan
see
due
de
memoirs
tome
ii
and
also
incurred
the
displeasure
of
napoleon
at
wagram
see
later
on
in
the
beginning
of
november
the
swedes
entered
lubeck
but
on
the
of
that
month
the
town
was
taken
by
assault
and
the
swedes
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
corps
which
had
escaped
from
jena
were
made
prisoners
a
troop
of
prussians
had
advanced
within
four
leagues
of
hamburg
and
that
town
had
already
prepared
for
a
vigorous
resistance
in
case
they
should
attempt
an
entrance
when
major
amiel
attacked
them
at
zollenspieker
and
made
some
prisoners
hamburg
was
however
threatened
with
another
danger
for
major
amiel
expressed
his
intention
of
entering
with
all
his
prisoners
notwithstanding
the
acknowledged
neutrality
of
the
town
amiel
was
a
partisan
leader
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
he
fought
rather
on
his
own
account
than
with
the
intention
of
contributing
to
the
success
of
the
operations
of
the
army
his
troop
did
not
consist
of
more
than
forty
men
but
that
was
more
than
sufficient
to
spread
terror
and
devastation
in
the
surrounding
villages
he
was
a
bold
fellow
and
when
with
his
handful
of
men
he
threw
himself
upon
hamburg
the
worthy
inhabitants
thought
he
had
troops
with
him
he
had
pillaged
every
place
through
which
he
passed
and
brought
with
him
prisoners
and
a
great
many
horses
he
had
taken
on
his
road
it
was
night
when
he
presented
himself
at
the
gates
of
the
city
which
he
entered
alone
having
left
his
men
and
booty
at
the
last
village
he
proceeded
to
the
french
embassy
i
was
not
there
at
the
time
but
i
was
sent
for
and
about
seven
in
the
evening
i
had
my
first
interview
with
the
major
he
was
the
very
beau
ideal
of
a
bandit
and
would
have
been
an
admirable
model
for
a
painter
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
that
on
his
arrival
his
wild
appearance
and
huge
mustachios
had
excited
some
degree
of
terror
among
those
who
were
in
the
salon
he
described
his
exploits
on
the
march
and
did
not
disguise
his
intention
of
bringing
his
troops
into
hamburg
next
day
he
talked
of
the
bank
and
of
pillage
i
tried
for
some
time
to
divert
him
from
this
idea
but
without
effect
and
at
length
said
to
him
sir
you
know
that
this
is
not
the
way
the
emperor
wishes
to
be
served
during
the
seven
years
that
i
have
been
about
him
i
have
invariably
heard
him
express
his
indignation
against
those
who
aggravate
the
misery
which
war
naturally
brings
in
her
train
it
is
the
express
wish
of
the
emperor
that
no
damage
no
violence
whatever
shall
be
committed
on
the
city
or
territory
of
hamburg
these
few
words
produced
a
stronger
effect
than
any
entreaties
i
could
have
used
for
the
mere
name
of
the
emperor
made
even
the
boldest
tremble
and
major
amiel
next
thought
of
selling
his
booty
the
senate
were
so
frightened
at
the
prospect
of
having
amiel
quartered
upon
them
that
to
get
rid
of
him
they
determined
to
purchase
his
booty
at
once
and
even
furnished
him
with
guards
for
his
prisoners
i
did
not
learn
till
some
time
afterwards
that
among
the
horses
major
amiel
had
seized
upon
the
road
were
those
of
the
countess
walmoden
had
i
known
this
fact
at
the
time
i
should
certainly
have
taken
care
to
have
had
them
restored
to
her
madame
walmoden
was
then
a
refugee
at
hamburg
and
between
her
and
my
family
a
close
intimacy
existed
on
the
very
day
i
believe
of
the
major
departure
the
senate
wrote
me
a
letter
of
thanks
for
the
protection
i
afforded
the
town
before
the
commencement
of
the
prussian
campaign
while
anxiety
was
entertained
respecting
the
designs
of
the
cabinet
of
berlin
my
task
was
not
an
easy
one
i
exerted
all
my
efforts
to
acquaint
the
french
government
with
what
was
passing
on
the
spree
i
announced
the
first
intelligence
of
an
unexpected
movement
which
had
taken
place
among
the
prussian
troops
cantoned
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hamburg
they
suddenly
evacuated
lauenburg
platzburg
haarburg
stade
twisenfelth
and
cuxhaven
this
extraordinary
movement
gave
rise
to
a
multitude
of
surmises
i
was
not
wrong
when
i
informed
the
french
government
that
according
to
every
probability
prussia
was
about
to
declare
hostilities
against
france
and
to
enter
into
an
alliance
with
england
i
much
regretted
that
my
situation
did
not
allow
me
more
frequent
opportunities
of
meeting
thornton
the
english
minister
to
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
however
i
saw
him
sometimes
and
had
on
two
different
occasions
the
opportunity
of
rendering
him
some
service
thornton
had
requested
me
to
execute
a
little
private
business
for
him
the
success
of
which
depended
on
the
emperor
i
made
the
necessary
communication
to
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
adding
in
my
letter
that
thornton
conduct
towards
the
french
who
had
come
in
any
way
in
contact
with
him
had
ever
been
just
and
liberal
and
that
i
should
receive
great
pleasure
in
being
able
to
announce
to
him
the
success
of
his
application
his
request
was
granted
on
another
occasion
thornton
applied
to
me
for
my
services
and
i
had
once
more
the
pleasure
of
rendering
them
he
wished
to
procure
some
information
respecting
an
englishman
named
baker
who
had
gone
to
terracina
in
the
campagna
di
roma
for
the
benefit
of
he
was
there
arrested
without
any
cause
assigned
by
order
of
the
commandant
of
the
french
troops
in
terracina
the
family
of
baker
not
having
heard
from
him
for
some
months
became
very
uneasy
respecting
him
for
they
had
not
the
least
idea
of
his
arrest
his
relations
applied
to
thornton
and
that
gentleman
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
which
as
i
have
stated
prevented
our
frequent
intercourse
hesitated
not
a
moment
in
requesting
me
to
furnish
him
with
some
information
respecting
his
countryman
i
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
alquier
our
ambassador
at
rome
and
soon
enabled
thornton
to
ease
the
apprehension
of
baker
friends
i
had
every
opportunity
of
knowing
what
was
passing
in
italy
for
i
had
just
been
invested
with
a
new
dignity
as
the
new
king
of
naples
joseph
had
no
minister
in
lower
saxony
he
wished
that
i
should
discharge
the
function
of
minister
plenipotentiary
for
naples
his
ministers
accordingly
received
orders
to
correspond
with
me
upon
all
business
connected
with
his
government
and
his
subjects
the
relations
between
hamburg
and
naples
were
nearly
nil
and
my
new
office
made
no
great
addition
to
my
labours
i
experienced
however
a
little
more
difficulty
in
combining
all
the
of
hamburg
in
the
office
of
the
grand
duchy
of
berg
thus
detaching
them
from
the
offices
of
latour
and
taxis
so
named
after
the
german
family
who
for
a
length
of
time
had
had
the
possession
of
them
and
who
were
devoted
to
austria
after
some
days
of
negotiation
i
obtained
the
suppression
of
these
offices
and
their
union
with
the
postoffice
of
the
grand
due
de
berg
murat
who
thus
received
letters
from
italy
hungary
germany
poland
part
of
russia
and
the
letters
from
england
for
these
countries
the
affair
of
the
gained
for
me
the
approbation
of
napoleon
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
through
the
medium
of
a
letter
i
received
from
duroc
who
at
the
same
time
recommended
me
to
continue
informing
the
emperor
of
all
that
was
doing
in
germany
with
relation
to
the
plans
of
the
confederation
of
the
north
i
therefore
despatched
to
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
a
detailed
letter
announcing
that
baron
grote
the
prussian
minister
at
hamburg
had
set
off
on
a
visit
to
bremen
and
lubeck
among
those
who
accompanied
him
on
this
excursion
was
a
person
wholly
devoted
to
me
and
i
knew
that
baron
grote
object
was
to
offer
to
these
towns
verbal
propositions
for
their
union
with
the
confederation
of
the
north
which
the
king
of
prussia
wished
to
form
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
just
created
by
napoleon
baron
grote
observed
the
strictest
secrecy
in
all
his
movements
he
showed
in
confidence
to
those
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
a
letter
from
haugwitz
the
minister
of
the
king
of
prussia
in
july
after
austerlitz
napoleon
had
formed
the
confederation
du
rhin
to
include
the
smaller
states
of
germany
who
threw
off
all
connection
with
the
german
empire
and
formed
a
confederation
furnishing
a
considerable
army
the
emperor
of
germany
francis
il
had
already
in
on
napoleon
taking
the
title
of
emperor
declared
himself
hereditary
emperor
of
austria
after
the
formation
of
the
rhenish
confederation
and
napoleon
refusal
to
acknowledge
the
german
empire
any
longer
he
released
the
states
of
the
holy
roman
empire
from
their
allegiance
declared
the
empire
dissolved
and
contented
himself
with
the
title
of
emperor
of
austria
as
francis
i
who
endeavoured
to
point
out
to
the
hanse
towns
how
much
the
confederation
of
the
north
would
turn
to
their
advantage
it
being
the
only
means
of
preserving
their
liberty
by
establishing
a
formidable
power
however
to
the
first
communication
only
an
evasive
answer
was
returned
van
sienen
the
syndic
of
hamburg
was
commissioned
by
the
senate
to
inform
the
prussian
minister
that
the
affair
required
the
concurrence
of
the
burghers
and
that
before
he
could
submit
it
to
them
it
would
be
necessary
to
know
its
basis
and
conditions
meanwhile
the
syndic
doormann
proceeded
to
lubeck
where
there
was
also
a
deputy
from
bremen
the
project
of
the
confederation
however
never
came
to
anything
i
scrupulously
discharged
the
duties
of
my
functions
but
i
confess
i
often
found
it
difficult
to
execute
the
orders
i
received
and
more
than
once
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
modify
their
severity
i
loved
the
frank
and
generous
character
of
the
hamburgers
and
i
could
not
help
pity
the
fate
of
the
hanse
towns
heretofore
so
happy
and
from
which
bonaparte
had
exacted
such
immense
sacrifices
on
the
principal
gate
of
the
hanse
towns
is
inscribed
the
following
motto
well
expressing
the
pacific
spirit
of
the
people
nobis
pacem
domine
in
diebus
nostris
the
paternal
and
elected
government
which
did
everything
to
secure
the
happiness
of
these
towns
was
led
to
believe
that
the
sacrifices
imposed
on
them
would
be
recompensed
by
the
preservation
of
their
neutrality
no
distrust
was
entertained
and
hope
was
kept
alive
by
the
assurances
given
by
napoleon
he
published
in
the
moniteur
that
the
hanse
towns
could
not
be
included
in
any
particular
confederation
he
thus
strangled
in
its
birth
the
confederation
of
the
north
to
which
those
feeble
states
would
otherwise
have
been
obliged
to
consent
when
in
napoleon
marched
against
prussia
he
detached
marshal
mortier
from
the
grand
army
when
it
had
passed
the
rhine
and
directed
him
to
invade
the
electorate
of
hesse
and
march
on
hamburg
on
the
of
november
the
latter
town
was
occupied
by
the
french
army
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
amidst
the
utmost
order
and
tranquillity
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
was
under
much
apprehension
as
to
this
event
at
the
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
the
french
army
consternation
was
great
and
universal
in
hamburg
which
was
anxious
to
maintain
its
neutrality
unimpaired
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
magistrates
of
the
city
i
assumed
functions
more
than
diplomatic
and
became
in
some
respects
the
first
magistrate
of
the
town
i
went
to
meet
marshal
mortier
to
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
entering
i
thought
i
should
by
this
means
better
serve
the
interests
of
france
than
by
favouring
the
occupation
of
a
neutral
town
by
our
troops
but
all
my
remonstrances
were
useless
marshal
mortier
had
received
formal
orders
from
the
emperor
no
preparations
having
been
made
at
hamburg
for
the
reception
of
marshal
mortier
he
quartered
himself
and
his
whole
staff
upon
me
the
few
troops
he
had
with
him
were
disposed
of
in
my
courtyard
so
that
the
residence
of
a
minister
of
peace
was
all
at
once
converted
into
headquarters
this
state
of
things
continued
until
a
house
was
got
ready
for
the
marshal
marshal
mortier
had
to
make
very
rigorous
exactions
but
my
representations
suspended
for
a
while
napoleon
orders
for
taking
possession
of
the
bank
of
hamburg
i
am
here
bound
to
bear
testimony
to
the
marshal
honourable
principles
and
integrity
of
character
the
representations
which
i
had
sent
to
marshal
mortier
were
transmitted
by
the
latter
to
the
emperor
at
berlin
and
mortier
stated
that
he
had
suspended
the
execution
of
the
orders
until
he
should
receive
others
the
emperor
approved
of
this
it
was
indeed
a
happy
event
for
france
and
for
europe
even
more
so
than
for
hamburg
those
who
suggested
to
the
emperor
the
idea
of
pillaging
that
fine
establishment
must
have
been
profoundly
ignorant
of
its
importance
they
thought
only
of
the
of
marks
banco
deposited
in
its
cellars
by
the
famous
decree
of
berlin
dated
november
mortier
was
compelled
to
order
the
seizure
of
all
english
merchandise
in
the
hanse
towns
but
he
enforced
the
decree
only
so
far
as
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
having
obeyed
his
orders
mortier
on
leaving
hamburg
for
mecklenburg
was
succeeded
by
general
michaud
who
in
his
turn
was
succeeded
by
marshal
brune
in
the
beginning
of
i
am
very
glad
to
take
the
present
opportunity
of
correcting
the
misconceptions
which
arose
through
the
execution
of
certain
acts
of
imperial
tyranny
the
truth
is
marshal
brune
during
his
government
constantly
endeavoured
to
moderate
as
far
as
he
could
the
severity
of
the
orders
he
received
bernadotte
became
governor
of
hamburg
when
the
battle
of
jena
rendered
napoleon
master
of
prussia
and
the
north
of
germany
the
prince
of
lightened
as
far
as
possible
the
unjust
burdens
and
vexations
to
which
that
unfortunate
town
was
subject
he
never
refused
his
assistance
to
any
measures
which
i
adopted
to
oppose
a
system
of
ruin
and
persecution
he
often
protected
hamburg
against
exorbitant
exactions
the
hanse
towns
revived
a
little
under
his
government
which
continued
longer
than
that
of
mortier
michaud
and
brune
the
memory
of
bernadotte
will
always
be
dear
to
the
hamburgers
and
his
name
will
never
be
pronounced
without
gratitude
his
attention
was
especially
directed
to
moderate
the
rigour
of
the
and
perhaps
the
effect
which
his
conduct
produced
on
public
opinion
may
be
considered
as
having
in
some
measure
led
to
the
decision
which

would
not

in

showed
the

and
the
security
of

own

declared
his
determination
of
not
only
completing
but
augmenting
his
army
he
therefore
ordered
a
levy
of
four
men
out
of
every
inhabitants
before

duroc
was

with
the

of
discovering
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
renewing

but
affairs
were
already
too
much
embarrassed
all
duroc
endeavours
were
in
vain
and
perhaps
it
was
no
longer
in
the
power
of
the
king
of
prussia
to
avoid
war
with
france
besides
he
had
just
grounds
of
offence
against
the
emperor
although
the
latter
had
given
him
hanover
in
exchange
for
the
two
margravates
he
had
nevertheless
offered
to
england
the
restoration
of
that
province
as
one
of
the
terms
of
the
negotiations
commenced
with
fox
this
underhand
work
was
not
unknown
to
the
berlin
cabinet
and
napoleon
duplicity
rendered
duroc
mission
useless
at
this
time
the
king
of

was
at

victory
everywhere
favoured
the
french
arms
prince
hohenlohe
who
commanded
a
corps
of
the
prussian
army
was
forced
to
capitulate
at
prentzlau
after
this
capitulation
general
blucher
took
the
command
of
the
remains
of
the
corps
to
which
he
joined
the
troops
whose
absence
from
prentzlau
exempted
them
from
the
capitulation
these
corps
added
to
those
which
blucher
had
at
auerstadt
were
then
almost
the
only
ramparts
of
the
prussian
monarchy
soult
and
bernadotte
received
orders
from
murat
to
pursue
blucher
who
was
using
all
his
efforts
to
draw
from
berlin
the
forces
of
those
two
generals
blucher
marched
in
the
direction
of
lubeck
general

pursued
the
wreck
of
the
prussian
army
which
had
escaped
from
saxony
by

blucher
was
driven
upon
lubeck
it
was
very
important
to
the
army
at
berlin
that
this
numerous
corps
should
be
destroyed
commanded
as
it
was
by
a
skillful
and
brave
general
who
drew
from
the
centre
of
the
military
operations
numerous
troops
with
which
he
might
throw
himself
into
hanover
or
hesse
or
even
holland
and
by
joining
the
english
troops
harass
the
rear
of
the
grand
army
the
grand
duke
of
berg
explained
to
me
his
plans
and
expectations
and
soon
after
announced
their
fulfilment
in
several
letters
which
contained
among
other
things
the
particulars
of
the
taking
of
lubeck
in
two
of
these
letters
murat
who
was
probably
deceived
by
his
agents
or
by
some
intriguer
informed
me
that
general
moreau
had
passed
through
paris
on
the
of
october
and
had
arrived
in
hamburg
on
the
of
october
the
proof
which
murat
possessed
of
this
circumstance
was
a
letter
of
which
he
had
intercepted
i
recollect
a
curious
circumstance
which
serves
to
show
the
necessity
of
mistrusting
the
vague
intelligence
furnished
to
persons
in
authority
a
fortnight
before
i
received
murat
first
letter
a
person
informed
me
that
general
moreau
was
in
hamburg
i
gave
no
credit
to
this
intelligence
yet
i
endeavoured
to
ascertain
whether
it
had
any
foundation
but
without
effect
two
days
later
i
was
assured
that
an
individual
had
met
general
moreau
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
that
he
knew
him
well
from
having
served
under
him
together
with
various
other
circumstances
the
truth
of
which
there
appeared
no
reason
to
doubt
i
immediately
sent
for
the
individual
in
question
who
told
me
that
he
knew
moreau
that
he
had
met
him
that
the
general
had
inquired
of
him
the
way
to
the
jungfersteige
a
promenade
at
hamburg
that
he
had
pointed
it
out
to
him
and
then
said
have
i
not
the
honour
to
speak
to
general
moreau
upon
which
the
general
answered
yes
but
say
nothing
about
having
seen
me
i
am
here
incognito
all
this
appeared
to
me
so
absurd
that
pretending
not
to
know
moreau
i
asked
the
person
to
describe
him
to
me
he
described
a
person
bearing
little
resemblance
to
moreau
and
added
that
he
wore
a
braided
french
coat
and
the
national
cockade
in
his
hat
i
instantly
perceived
the
whole
was
a
mere
scheme
for
getting
a
little
money
i
sent
the
fellow
about
his
business
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
i
had
got
rid
of
him
la
chevardiere
called
on
me
and
introduced
billaud
the
french
consul
at
stettin
this
gentleman
wore
a
braided
coat
and
the
national
cockade
in
his
hat
he
was
the
hero
of
the
story
i
had
heard
from
the
informer
a
slight
personal
resemblance
between
the
consul
and
the
general
had
caused
several
persons
to
mistake
them
for
each
other
during
the
prussian
campaign
nothing
was
talked
of
throughout
germany
but
napoleon
generous
conduct
with
respect
to
prince
hatzfeld
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
copy
of
a
letter
which
the
emperor
wrote
to
josephine
on
the
subject
and
which
i
shall
presently
lay
before
the
reader
in
conformity
with
the
inquisitorial
system
which
too
frequently
characterised
the
emperor
government
and
which
he
extended
to
every
country
of
which
he
had
military
possession
the
first
thing
done
on
entering
a
town
was
to
take
possession
of
the
and
then
heaven
knows
how
little
respect
was
shown
to
the
privacy
of
correspondence
among
the
letters
thus
seized
at
berlin
and
delivered
to
napoleon
was
one
addressed
to
the
king
of
prussia
by
prince
hatzfeld
who
had
imprudently
remained
in
the
prussian
capital
in
this
letter
the
prince
gave
his
sovereign
an
account
of
all
that
had
occurred
in
berlin
since
he
had
been
compelled
to
quit
at
and
at
the
same
time
he
informed
him
of
the
force
and
situation
of
the
corps
of
the
french
army
the
emperor
after
reading
this
letter
ordered
that
the
prince
should
be
arrested
and
tried
by
a
on
the
charge
of
being
a
spy
the
court
was
summoned
and
little
doubt
could
be
entertained
as
to
its
decision
when
madame
hatzfeld
repaired
to
duroc
who
on
such
occasions
was
always
happy
when
he
could
facilitate
communication
with
the
emperor
on
that
day
napoleon
had
been
at
a
review
duroc
knew
madame
hatzfeld
whom
he
had
several
times
seen
on
his
visits
to
berlin
when
napoleon
returned
from
the
review
he
was
astonished
to
see
duroc
at
the
palace
at
that
hour
and
inquired
whether
he
had
brought
any
news
duroc
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
followed
the
emperor
into
his
cabinet
where
he
soon
introduced
madame
hatzfeld
the
remainder
of
the
scene
is
described
in
napoleon
letter
it
may
easily
be
perceived
that
this
letter
is
an
answer
to
one
from
josephine
reproaching
him
for
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
women
and
very
probably
of
the
beautiful
and
unfortunate
queen
of
prussia
respecting
whom
he
had
expressed
himself
with
too
little
respect
in
one
of
his
bulletins
the
following
is
napoleon
letter
i
have
received
your
letter
in
which
you
seem
to
reproach
me
for
speaking
ill
of
women
it
is
true
that
i
dislike
female
intriguers
above
all
things
i
am
used
to
kind
gentle
and
conciliatory
women
i
love
them
and
if
they
have
spoiled
me
it
is
not
my
fault
but
yours
however
you
will
see
that
i
have
done
an
act
of
kindness
to
one
deserving
woman
i
allude
to
madame
de
hatzfeld
when
i
showed
her
her
husband
letter
she
stood
weeping
and
in
a
tone
of
mingled
grief
and
ingenuousness
said
it
is
indeed
his
writing
this
went
to
my
heart
and
i
said
well
madame
throw
the
letter
into
the
fire
and
then
i
shall
have
no
proof
against
your
husband
she
burned
the
letter
and
was
restored
to
happiness
her
husband
now
is
safe
two
hours
later
and
he
would
have
been
lost
you
see
therefore
that
i
like
women
who
are
simple
gentle
and
amiable
because
they
alone
resemble
you
november
when
marshal
bernadotte
had
driven
blucher
into
lubeck
and
made
him
prisoner
he
sent
to
inform
me
of
the
circumstance
but
i
was
far
from
expecting
that
the
prisoner
would
be
confided
to
my
charge
such
however
was
the
case
after
his
capitulation
he
was
sent
to
hamburg
where
he
had
the
whole
city
for
his
prison
i
was
curious
to
become
acquainted
with
this
celebrated
man
and
i
saw
him
very
frequently
i
found
that
he
was
an
enthusiastic
prussian
patriot
a
brave
man
enterprising
even
to
rashness
of
limited
education
and
almost
to
an
incredible
degree
devoted
to
pleasure
of
which
he
took
an
ample
share
while
he
remained
in
hamburg
he
sat
an
enormous
time
at
table
and
notwithstanding
his
exclusive
patriotism
he
rendered
full
justice
to
the
wines
of
france
his
passion
for
women
was
unbounded
and
one
of
his
most
favourite
sources
of
amusement
was
the
at
which
he
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
blucher
was
of
an
extremely
gay
disposition
and
considered
merely
as
a
companion
he
was
very
agreeable
the
original
style
of
his
conversation
pleased
me
much
his
confidence
in
the
deliverance
of
germany
remained
unshaken
in
spite
of
the
disasters
of
the
prussian
army
he
often
said
to
me
i
place
great
reliance
on
the
public
spirit
of
germany
on
the
enthusiasm
which
prevails
in
our
universities
the
events
of
war
are
daily
changing
and
even
defeats
con
tribute
to
nourish
in
a
people
sentiments
of
honour
and
national
glory
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
when
a
whole
nation
is
determined
to
shake
off
a
humiliating
yoke
it
will
succeed
there
is
no
doubt
but
we
shall
end
by
having
a
landwehr
very
different
from
any
militia
to
which
the
subdued
spirit
of
the
french
people
could
give
birth
england
will
always
lend
us
the
support
of
her
navy
and
her
subsidies
and
we
will
renew
alliances
with
russia
and
austria
i
can
pledge
myself
to
the
truth
of
a
fact
of
which
i
have
certain
knowledge
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
namely
that
none
of
the
allied
powers
engaged
in
the
present
war
entertain
views
of
territorial
aggrandisement
all
they
unanimously
desire
is
to
put
an
end
to
the
system
of
aggrandisement
which
your
emperor
has
established
and
acts
upon
with
such
alarming
rapidity
in
our
first
war
against
france
at
the
commencement
of
your
revolution
we
fought
for
questions
respecting
the
rights
of
sovereigns
for
which
i
assure
you
i
care
very
little
but
now
the
case
is
altered
the
whole
population
of
prussia
makes
common
cause
with
its
government
the
people
fight
in
defence
of
their
homes
and
reverses
destroy
our
armies
without
changing
the
spirit
of
the
nation
i
rely
confidently
on
the
future
because
i
foresee
that
fortune
will
not
always
favour
your
emperor
it
is
impossible
but
the
time
will
come
when
all
europe
humbled
by
his
exactions
and
impatient
of
his
depredations
will
rise
up
against
him
the
more
he
enslaves
nations
the
more
terrible
will
be
the
reaction
when
they
break
their
chains
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
is
tormented
with
an
insatiable
desire
of
acquiring
new
territories
to
the
war
of
against
austria
and
russia
the
present
war
has
almost
immediately
succeeded
we
have
fallen
prussia
is
occupied
but
russia
still
remains
undefeated
i
can
not
foresee
what
will
be
the
termination
of
the
war
but
admitting
that
the
issue
should
be
favourable
to
you
it
will
end
only
to
break
out
again
speedily
if
we
continue
firm
france
exhausted
by
her
conquests
must
in
the
end
fall
you
may
be
certain
of
it
you
wish
for
peace
recommend
it
by
so
doing
you
will
give
strong
proofs
of
love
for
your
country
in
this
strain
blucher
constantly
spoke
to
me
and
as
i
never
thought
it
right
to
play
the
part
of
the
public
functionary
in
the
i
replied
to
him
with
the
reserve
necessary
in
my
situation
i
could
not
tell
him
how
much
my
anticipations
frequently
coincided
with
his
but
i
never
hesitated
to
express
to
him
how
much
i
wished
to
see
a
reasonable
peace
concluded
blucher
arrival
at
hamburg
was
preceded
by
that
of
prince
paul
of
wutrtemberg
the
second
son
of
one
of
the
two
kings
created
by
napoleon
whose
crowns
were
not
yet
a
year
old
this
young
prince
who
was
imbued
with
the
ideas
of
liberty
and
independence
which
then
prevailed
in
germany
had
taken
a
headlong
step
he
had
quitted
stuttgart
to
serve
in
the
prussian
campaign
without
having
asked
his
father
permission
which
inconsiderate
proceeding
might
have
drawn
napoleon
anger
upon
the
king
of
wurtemberg
the
king
of
prussia
advanced
prince
paul
to
the
rank
of
general
but
he
was
taken
prisoner
at
the
very
commencement
of
hostilities
prince
paul
was
not
as
has
been
erroneously
stated
conducted
to
stuttgart
by
a
captain
of
gendarmerie
he
came
to
hamburg
where
i
received
many
visits
from
him
he
did
not
yet
possess
very
definite
ideas
as
to
what
he
wished
for
after
he
was
made
prisoner
he
expressed
to
me
his
strong
desire
to
enter
the
french
service
and
often
asked
me
to
solicit
for
him
an
interview
with
the
emperor
he
obtained
this
interview
and
remained
for
a
long
time
in
paris
where
i
know
he
has
frequently
resided
since
the
restoration
the
individuals
whom
i
had
to
observe
in
hamburg
gave
me
much
less
trouble
than
our
neighbours
at
altona
the
number
of
the
latter
had
considerably
augmented
since
the
events
of
the
war
had
compelled
a
great
number
of
emigrants
who
had
taken
refuge
at
munster
to
leave
that
town
they
all
proceeded
to
altona
conquered
countries
became
as
dangerous
to
them
as
the
land
which
they
had
forsaken
the
most
distinguished
amongst
the
individuals
assembled
at
altona
were

stayed
long
enough
at
berlin
to
permit
of
the
arrival
of
a
deputation
from
the
french
senate
to
congratulate
him
on
his
first
triumphs
i
learned
that
in
this
instance
the
senatorial
deputation
departing
from
its
accustomed
complaisance
ventured
not
to
confine
itself
to
compliments
and
felicitations
but
went
so
far
as
to
interfere
with
the
emperor
plan
of
the
campaign
to
speak
of
the
danger
that
might
be
incurred
and
finally
to
express
a
desire
to
in
passing
the

see
peace
concluded
napoleon
received
this
communication
with
a
very
bad
grace
he
thought
the
senators
very
bold
to
meddle
with
his
affairs
treated
the
conscript
fathers
of
france
as
if
they
had
been
inconsiderate
youths
protested
according
to
custom
his
sincere
love
of
peace
and
told
the
deputation
that
it
was
prussia
backed
by
russia
and
not
he
who
wished
for
war
all
the
german
princes
who
had
taken
part
against
napoleon
fled
to
altona
after
the
battle
of
jena
with
as
much
precipitation
as
the
emigrants
themselves
the
hereditary
prince
of
weimar
the
duchess
of
holstein
prince
and
a
multitude
of
other
persons
distinguished
for
rank
and
fortune
arrived
there
almost
simultaneously
among
the
persons
who
took
refuge
in
altona
were
some
intriguers
of
whom
was
one
i
remember
receiving
a
report
respecting
a
violent
altercation
which
fauche
had
the
audacity
to
enter
into
with
comte
de
gimel
because
he
could
not
extort
money
from
the
count
in
payment
of
his
intrigues
comte
de
gimel
had
only
funds
for
the
payment
of
pensions
and
besides
he
had
too
much
sense
to
suppose
there
was
any
utility
in
the
stupid
pamphlets
of
and
therefore
he
dismissed
him
with
a
refusal
fauche
was
insolent
which
compelled
comte
de
gimel
to
send
him
about
his
business
as
he
deserved
this
circumstance
which
was
first
communicated
to
me
in
a
report
has
since
been
confirmed
by
a
person
who
witnessed
the
scene
merely
passed
through
hamburg
and
embarked
for
london
on
board
the
same
ship
which
took

morpeth

even

the
french
troops
fortunately
for
the
country
were
attached
to
the

commanded
by
the

this
military

alarmed
the
town
of

to
which
indeed
it
proved
very
injurious
i
wrote
to
marshal
bernadotte
on
the
subject
the
grounds
on
which
the
senate
appealed
for
the
evacuation
of
their
territory
were
such
that
bernadotte
could
not
but
acknowledge
their
justice
the
prolonged
stay
of
the
french
troops
in
the
bailiwick
of
bergdorf
which
had
all
the
appearance
of
an
occupation
might
have
led
to
the
confiscation
of
all
hamburg
property
in
england
to
the
laying
an
embargo
on
the
vessels
of
the
republic
and
consequently
to
the
ruin
of
a
great
part
of
the
trade
of

and
holland
which
was
carried
on
under
the
flag
of
hamburg
there
was
no
longer
any
motive
for
occupying
the
bailiwick
of
bergdorf
when
there
were
no
prussians
in
that
quarter
it
would
have
been
an
absurd
misfortune
that
eighty
men
stationed
in
that
bailiwick
should
for
the
sake
of
a
few
louis
and
a
few
ells
of
english
cloth
have
occasioned
the
confiscation
of

french
and
dutch
property

amount
of
francs
marshal
bernadotte
replied
to
me
on
the
of
november
and
said
i
hasten
to
inform
you
that
i
have
given
orders
for
the
evacuation
of
the
bailiwick
of
bergdorf
and
all
the
hamburg
territory
if
you
could
obtain
from
the
senate
of
hamburg
by
the
of
this
month
two
or
three
thousand
pairs
of
shoes
you
would
oblige
me
greatly
they
shall
be
paid
for
in
goods
or
in
money
i
obtained
what
bernadotte
required
from
the
senate
who
knew
his
integrity
while
they
were
aware
that
that
quality
was
not
the
characteristic
of
all
who
commanded
the
french
armies
what
extortions
took
place
during
the
occupation
of
prussia
i
will
mention
one
of
the
means
which
amongst
others
was
employed
at
berlin
to
procure
money
bills
of
exchange
were
drawn
on
which
endorsements
were
forged
and
these
bills
were
presented
to
the
bankers
on
whom
they
were
purported
to
be
drawn
one
day
some
of
these
forged
bills
to
a
large
amount
were
presented
to
mathiesen
and
silleine
of
hamburg
who
knowing
the
endorsement
to
be
forged
refused
to
cash
them
the
persons
who
presented
the
bills
carried
their
impudence
so
far
as
to
send
for
the
gendarmes
but
the
bankers
persisted
in
their
refusal
i
was
informed
of
this
almost
incredible
scene
which
had
drawn
together
a
great
number
of
people
indignant
at
such
audacious
robbery
i
instantly
proceeded
to
the
spot
and
sent
away
the
gendarmes
telling
them
it
was
not
their
duty
to
protect
robbers
and
that
it
was
my
business
to
listen
to
any
just
claims
which
might
be
advanced
under
clarke
government
at
berlin
the
inhabitants
were
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
oppression
and
exaction
amidst
these
exactions
and
infamous
proceedings
which
are
not
the
indispensable
consequences
of
war
the
dutch
generals
distinguished
themselves
by
a
degree
of
rapacity
which
brought
to
mind
the
period
of
the
french
republican
peculations
in
italy
it
certainly
was
not
their
new
king
who
set
the
example
of
this
conduct
his
moderation
was
well
known
and
it
was
as
much
the
result
of
his
disposition
as
of
his
honest
principles
louis
bonaparte
who
was
a
king
in
spite
of
himself
afforded
an
example
of
all
that
a
good
man
could
suffer
upon
a
usurped
throne
when
the
king
of
prussia
found
himself
defeated
at
every
point
he
bitterly
repented
having
undertaken
a
war
which
had
delivered
his
states
into
napoleon
power
in
less
time
than
that
in
which
austria
had
fallen
the
preceding
year
he
wrote
to
the
emperor
soliciting
a
suspension
of
hostilities
rapp
was
present
when
napoleon
received
the
king
of
prussia
letter
it
is
too
late
said
he
but
no
matter
i
wish
to
stop
the
effusion
of
blood
i
am
ready
to
agree
to
anything
which
is
not
prejudicial
to
the
honour
or
interests
of
the
nation
then
calling
duroc
he
gave
him
orders
to
visit
the
wounded
and
see
that
they
wanted
for
nothing
he
added
visit
every
man
on
my
behalf
give
them
all
the
consolation
of
which
they
stand
in
need
afterwards
find
the
king
of
prussia
and
if
he
offers
reasonable
proposals
let
me
know
them
negotiations
were
commenced
but
napoleon
conditions
were
of
a
nature
which
was
considered
inadmissible
prussia
still
hoped
for
assistance
from
the
russian
forces
besides
the
emperor
demands
extended
to
england
who
at
that
moment
had
no
reason
to
accede
to
the
pretensions
of
france
the
emperor
wished
england
to
restore
to
france
the
colonies
which
she
bad
captured
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
that
russia
should

then
occupied
in
short
he
acted
upon
the
advice
which
some
gives
to
his
ambassador
demand
everything
that
you
may
obtain
nothing
the
emperor
demands
were
in
fact
so
extravagant
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
he
himself
could
entertain
the
hope
of
their
being
accepted
negotiations
alternately
resumed
and
abandoned
were
carried
on
with
coldness
on
both
sides
until
the
moment
when
england
prevailed
on
russia
to
join
prussia
against
france
they
then
altogether
ceased
and
it
was
for
the
sake
of
appearing
to
wish
for
their
renewal
on
bases
still
more
favourable
to
france
that
napoleon
sent
duroc
to
the
king
of
prussia
duroc
found
the
king
at
osterode
on
the
other
side
of
the
vistula
the
only
answer
he
received
from
his
majesty
was
the
time
is
passed
which
was
very
much
like
napoleon
observation
it
is
too
late
whilst
duroc
was
on
his
mission
to
the
king
of
prussia
i
was
myself
negotiating
at
hamburg
bonaparte
was
very
anxious
to
detach
sweden
from
the
coalition
and
to
terminate
the
war
with
her
by
a
separate
treaty
sweden
indeed
was
likely
to
be
very
useful
to
him
if
prussia
russia
and
england
should
collect
a
considerable
mass
of
troops
in
the
north
denmark
was
already
with
us
and
by
gaining
over
sweden
also
the
union
of
those
two
powers
might
create
a
diversion
and
give
serious
alarm
to
the
coalition
which
would
be
obliged
to
concentrate
its
principal
force
to
oppose
the
attack
of
the
grand
army
in
poland
the
opinions
of
peyron
the
swedish
minister
at
hamburg
were
decidedly
opposed
to
the
war
in
which
his
sovereign
was
engaged
with
france
i
was
sorry
that
this
gentleman
left
hamburg
upon
leave
of
absence
for
a
year
just
at
the
moment
i
received
my
instructions
from
the
emperor
upon
this
subject
peyron
was
succeeded
by
netzel
and
i
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
perceiving
that
his
opinions
corresponded
in
every
respect
with
those
of
his
predecessor
as
soon
as
he
arrived
netzel
sought
an
interview
to
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
of
the
swedes
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
on
the
drave
he
entreated
me
to
allow
the
officers
to
return
to
sweden
on
their
parole
i
was
anxious
to
get
netzel
demand
acceded
to
and
availed
myself
of
that
opportunity
to
lead
him
gradually
to
the
subject
of
my
instructions
i
had
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
he
received
my
first
overtures
i
said
nothing
to
him
of
the
justice
of
which
he
was
not
previously
convinced
i
saw
he
understood
that
his
sovereign
would
have
everything
to
gain
by
a
reconciliation
with
france
and
he
told
me
that
all
sweden
demanded
peace
thus
encouraged
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
was
instructed
to
treat
with
him
netzel
assured
me
that
de
wetterstedt
the
king
of
sweden
private
secretary
with
whom
he
was
intimate
and
from
whom
he
showed
me
several
letters
was
of
the
same
opinion
on
the
subject
as
himself
he
added
that
he
had
permission
to
correspond
with
the
king
and
that
he
would
write
the
same
evening
to
his
sovereign
and
de
wetterstedt
to
acquaint
them
with
our
conversation
it
will
be
perceived
from
what
i
have
stated
that
no
negotiation
was
ever
commenced
under
more
favourable
auspices
but
who
could
foresee
what
turn
the
king
of
sweden
would
take
that
unlucky
prince
took
letter
in
very
ill
part
and
de
wetterstedt
himself
received
peremptory
orders
to
acquaint
netzel
with
his
sovereign
displeasure
at
his
having
presumed
to
visit
a
french
minster
and
above
all
to
enter
into
a
political
conversation
with
him
although
it
was
nothing
more
than
conversation
the
king
did
not
confine
himself
to
reproaches
netzel
came
in
great
distress
to
inform
me
he
had
received
orders
to
quit
hamburg
immediately
without
even
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
successor
he
regarded
his
disgrace
as
complete
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
netzel
again
in
at
hamburg
where
he
was
on
a
mission

i
have
a
few
remarks
to
make
on
the
famous
continental
system
which
was
a
subject
of
such
engrossing
interest
i
had
perhaps
better
opportunities
than
any
other
person
of
observing
the
fraud
and
estimating
the
fatal
consequences
of
this
system
it
took
its
rise
during
the
war
in
and
was
brought
into
existence
by
a
decree
dated
from
berlin
the
project
was
conceived
by
weak
counsellors
who
perceiving
the
emperor
just
indignation
at
the
duplicity
of
england
her
repugnance
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
him
and
her
constant
endeavours
to
raise
enemies
against
france
prevailed
upon
him
to
issue
the
decree
which
i
could
only
regard
as
an
act
of
madness
and
tyranny
it
was
not
a
decree
but
fleets
that
were
wanting
without
a
navy
it
was
ridiculous
to
declare
the
british
isles
in
a
state
of
blockade
whilst
the
english
fleets
were
in
fact
blockading
all
the
french
ports
this
declaration
was
however
made
in
the
berlin
decree
this
is
what
was
called
the
continental
system
which
in
plain
terms
was
nothing
but
a
system
of
fraud
and
pillage
one
can
now
scarcely
conceive
how
europe
could
for
a
single
day
endure
that
fiscal
tyranny
which
extorted
exorbitant
prices
for
articles
which
the
habits
of
three
centuries
had
rendered
indispensable
to
the
poor
as
well
as
to
the
rich
so
little
of
truth
is
there
in
the
pretence
that
this
system
had
for
its
sole
and
exclusive
object
to
prevent
the
sale
of
english
goods
that
licences
for
their
disposal
were
procured
at
a
high
price
by
whoever
was
rich
enough
to
pay
for
them
the
number
and
quality
of
the
articles
exported
from
france
were
extravagantly
exaggerated
it
was
indeed
necessary
to
take
out
some
of
the
articles
is
compliance
with
the
emperor
wishes
but
they
were
only
thrown
into
the
sea
and
yet
no
one
had
the
honesty
to
tell
the
emperor
that
england
sold
on
the
continent
but
bought
scarcely
anything
the
speculation
in
licences
was
carried
to
a
scandalous
extent
only
to
enrich
a
few
and
to
satisfy
the
views
of
the
contrivers
of
the
system
this
system
proves
what
is
written
in
the
annals
of
the
human
heart
and
mind
that
the
cupidity
of
the
one
is
insatiable
and
the
errors
of
the
other
incorrigible
of
this
i
will
cite
an
example
though
it
refers
to
a
period
posterior
to
the
origin
of
the
continental
system
in
hamburg
in
under
davoust
government
a
poor
man
had
been
shot
for
having
introduced
into
the
department
of
the
elbe
a
small
loaf
of
sugar
for
the
use
of
his
family
while
at
the
same
moment
napoleon
was
perhaps
signing
a
licence
for
the
importation
of
a
million
of
loaves
in
this
same
year
murat
as
king
of
naples
not
only
winked
at
the
infringement
of
the
continental
system
but
almost
openly
broke
the
law
himself
his
troops
in
calabria
and
all
round
his
immense
line
sea
coast
carried
on
an
active
trade
with
sicilian
and
english
smugglers
this
was
so
much
the
case
that
an
officer
never
set
out
from
naples
to
join
without
being
requested
by
his
wife
his
relations
or
friends
to
bring
them
some
english
muslins
some
sugar
and
coffee
together
with
a
few
needles
and
razors
some
of
the
neapolitan
officers
embarked
in
really
large
commercial
operations

who
were
there

the
comte
de
a
french
officer
on

staff
was
very
noble
but
very
poor
and
excessively
extravagant
after
making
several
vain
efforts
to
set
him
up
in
the
world
the
king
told
him
one
day
he
would
give
him
the
command
of
the
troops
round
the
gulf
of
salerno

that
the

not

from

attended
the
installation
of
the
odious

the
president
of
the
prevotal
court
at
hamburg
who
was
a
frenchman
delivered
an
address
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
prove
that
in
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
there
had
existed
extraordinary
fiscal
tribunals
and
that
it
was
to
those
egypt
owed
her
prosperity
terror
was
thus
introduced
by
the
most
absurd
folly
the
ordinary
customhouse
officers
formerly
so
much
abhorred
in
hamburg
declared
with
reason
that
they
would
soon
be
regretted
and
than
the
difference
between
them
and
the
prevotal
courts
would
soon
be
felt
bonaparte
counsellors
led
him
to
commit
the
folly
of
requiring
that
a
ship
which
had
obtained
a
licence
should
export
merchandise
equivalent
to
that
of
the
colonial
produce
to
be
imported
under
the
authority
of
the
licence
what
was
the
consequence
the
speculators
bought
at
a
low
price
old
stores
of
change
of
fashion
had
made
completely
unsaleable
and
as
those
articles
were
prohibited
in
england
they
were
thrown
into
the
sea
without
their
loss
being
felt
the
profits
of
the
speculation
made
ample
amends
for
the
sacrifice
the
continental
system
was
worthy
only
of
the
ages
of
ignorance
and
barbarism
and
had
it
been
admissible

sydney

essays
of

smith
edition
of
it
can
not
be
sufficiently
stigmatised
they
were
not
the
friends
of
the
emperor
who
recommended
a
system
calculated
to
rouse
the
indignation
of
europe
and
which
could
not
fail
to
create
reaction
to
tyrannize
over
the
human
species
and
to
exact
uniform
admiration
and
submission
is
to
require
an
impossibility
it
would
seem
that
fate
which
had
still
some
splendid
triumphs
in
store
for
bonaparte
intended
to
prepare
beforehand
the
causes
which
were
to
deprive
him
of
all
his
triumphs
at
once
and
plunge
him
into
reverses
even
greater
than
the
good
fortune
which
had
favoured
his
elevation
the
prohibition
of
trade
the
habitual
severity
in
the
execution
of
this
odious
system
made
it
operate
like
a
continental
impost
i
will
give
a
proof
of
this
and
i
state
nothing
but
what
came
under
my
own
observation
the
fiscal
regulations
were
very
rigidly
enforced
at
hamburg
and
along
the
two
lines
of
cuxhaven
and
travemunde
eudel
the
director
of
that
department
performed
his
duty
with
zeal
and
disinterestedness
i
feel
gratified
in
rendering
him
this
tribute
enormous
quantities
of
english
merchandise
and
colonial
produce
were
accumulated
at
holstein
where
they
almost
all
arrived
by
way
of
kiel
and
hudsum
and
were
smuggled
over
the
line
at
the
expense
of
a
premium
of
and
per
cent
convinced
of
this
fact
by
a
thousand
proofs
and
weary
of
the
vexations
of
the
preventive
system
i
took
upon
myself
to
lay
my
opinions
on
the
subject
before
the
emperor
he
had
given
me
permission
to
write
to
him
personally
without
any
intermediate
agency
upon
everything
that
i
might
consider
essential
to
his
service
i
sent
an
extraordinary
courier
to
fontainebleau
where
he
then
was
and
in
my
despatch
i
informed
him
that
notwithstanding
his
preventive
guard
every
prohibited
article
was
smuggled
in
because
the
profits
on
the
sale
in
germany
poland
italy
and
even
france
into
which
the
contrabrand
goods
found
their
way
were
too
considerable
not
to
induce
persons
to
incur
all
risks
to
obtain
them
i
advised
him
at
the
very
time
he
was
about
to
unite
the
hanse
towns
to
the
french
empire
to
permit
merchandise
to
be
imported
subject
to
a
duty
of
per
which
was
about
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
premium
for
insurance
the
emperor
adopted
my
advice
without
hesitation
and
in
the
regulation
produced
a
revenue
of
upwards
of
francs
in
hamburg
alone
this
system
however
embroiled
us
with
sweden
and
russia
who
could
not
endure
that
napoleon
should
enact
a
strict
blockade
from
them
whilst
he
was
himself
distributing
licences
in
abundance
bernadotte
on
his
way
to
sweden
passed
through
hamburg
in
october
he
stayed
with
me
three
days
during
which
time
he
scarcely
saw
any
person
but
myself
he
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
should
do
in
regard
to
the
continental
system
i
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
to
him
not
as
a
french
minister
but
as
a
private
individual
to
his
friend
that
in
his
place
at
the
head
of
a
poor
nation
which
could
only
subsist
by
the
exchange
of
its
territorial
productions
with
england
i
would
open
my
ports
and
give
the
swedes
gratuitously
that
general
licence
which
bonaparte
sold
in
detail
to
intrigue
and
cupidity
the
berlin
decree
could
not
fail
to
cause
a
reaction
against
the
emperor
fortune
by
raising
up
whole
nations
against
him
the
hurling
of
twenty
kings
from
their
thrones
would
have
excited
less
hatred
than
this
contempt
for
the
wants
of
nations
this
profound
ignorance
of
the
maxims
of
political
economy
caused
general
privation
and
misery
which
in
their
turn
occasioned
general
hostility
the
system
could
only
succeed
in
the
impossible
event
of
all
the
powers
of
europe
honestly
endeavouring
to
carry
it
into
effect
a
single
free
port
would
have
destroyed
it
in
order
to
ensure
its
complete
success
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
and
occupy
all
countries
and
never
to
evacuate
them
as
a
means
of
ruining
england
it
was
contemptible
it
was
necessary
that
all
europe
should
be
compelled
by
force
of
arms
to
join
this
absurd
coalition
and
that
the
same
force
should
be
constantly
employed
to
maintain
it
was
this
possible
the
captain
rapporteur
of
a
allowed
a
poor
peasant
to
escape
the
punishment
due
to
the
offence
of
having
bought
a
loaf
of
sugar
beyond
the
barrier
this
officer
was
some
time
afterwards
at
a
dinner
given
by
marshal
davoust
the
latter
said
to
him
you
have
a
very
scrupulous
conscience
sir
go
to
headquarters
and
you
will
find
an
order
there
for
you
this
order
sent
him
eighty
leagues
from
hamburg
it
is
necessary
to
have
witnessed
as
i
have
the
numberless
vexations
and
miseries
occasioned
by
the
unfortunate
continental
system
to
understand
the
mischief
its
authors
did
in
europe
and
how
much
that
mischief
contributed
to
napoleon
fall
the
continental
system
was
framed
by
napoleon
in
revenge
for
the
english
very
extended
system
of
blockades
after
trafalgar
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
attempt
to
keep
the
seas
by
these
decrees
all
ports
occupied
by
the
french
were
closed
to
the
english
and
all
english
goods
were
to
be
destroyed
wherever
found
in
any
country
occupied
by
the
french
all
states
under
french
influence
had
to
adopt
this
system
it
must
be
remembered
that
napoleon
eventually
held
or
enforced
his
system
on
all
the
coastlines
of
europe
except
that
of
spain
and
turkey
but
as
bourrienne
shows
the
plan
of
giving
licences
to
break
his
own
system
was
too
lucrative
to
be
resisted
by
him
or
still
more
by
his
officers
for
the
working
of
the
system
in
the
occupied
lands
laffite
the
banker
told
savary
it
was
a
grand
idea
but
impracticable
savary
tome
the
emperor
alexander
is
reported
to
have
said
after
visiting
england
in
that
he
believed
the
system
would
have
reduced
england
if
it

was
not

the
greatest
captain
of
modern
times
but
he
may
be
said
to
have
wrought
a
complete
change
in
the
art
of
war
before
his
time
the
most
able
generals
regulated
the
fighting
season
by
the
almanac
it
was
customary
in
europe
to
brave
the
cannon
mouth
only
from
the
first
fine
days
of
spring
to
the
last
fine
days
of
autumn
and
the
months
of
rain
snow
and
frost
were
passed
in
what
were
called
winter
quarters
pichegru
in
holland
had
set
the
example
of
indifference
to
temperature
at
austerlitz
too
bonaparte
had
braved
the
severity
of
winter
this
answered
his
purpose
well
and
he
adopted
the
same
course
in
his
military
genius
and
activity
seemed
to
increase
and
proud
of
his
troops
he
determined
to
commence
a
winter
campaign
in
a
climate
more
rigorous
than
any
in
which
he
had
yet
fought
the
men
chained
to
his
destiny
were
now
required
to
brave
the
northern
blast
as
they
had
formerly
braved
the
vertical
sun
of
egypt
napoleon
who
above
all
generals
was
remarkable
for
the
choice
of
his
fields
of
battle
did
not
wish
to
wait
tranquilly
until
the
russian
army
which
was
advancing
towards
germany
should
come
to
measure
its
strength
with
him
in
the
plains
of
conquered
prussia
he
resolved
to
march
to
meet
it
and
to
reach
it
before
it
should
arose
the
vistula
but
before
he
left
berlin
to
explore
and
conqueror
poland
and
the
confines
of
russia
he
addressed
a
proclamation
to
his
troops
in
which
he
stated
all
that
had
hitherto
been
achieved
by
the
french
army
and
at
the
same
time
announced
his
future
intentions
it
was
especially
advisable
that
he
should
march
forward
for
had
he
waited
until
the
russians
had
passed
the
vistula
there
could
probably
have
been
no
winter
campaign
and
he
would
have
been
obliged
either
to
take
up
miserable
winter
quarters
between
the
vistula
and
the
oder
or
to
recross
the
oder
to
combat
the
enemy
in
prussia
napoleon
military
genius
and
indefatigable
activity
served
him
admirably
on
this
occasion
and
the
proclamation
just
alluded
to
which
was
dated
from
berlin
before
his
departure
from
charlottenburg
proves
that
he
did
not
act
fortuitously
as
he
frequently
did
but
that
his
calculations
were
before
leaving
the
capital
of
prussia
bonaparte
stole
from
the
monument
of
frederick
the
great
his
sword
and
military
orders
he
also
plundered
the
galleries
of
berlin
and
potsdam
of
their
best
pictures
and
statues
thus
continuing
the
system
he
had
began
is
italy
all
those
things
he
sent
to
paris
as
trophies
of
victory
and
editor
of
as
edition
a
rapid
and
immense
impulse
given
to
great
masses
of
men
by
the
will
of
a
single
individual
may
produce
transient
lustre
and
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
but
when
at
a
distance
from
the
theatre
of
glory
we
flee
only
the
melancholy
results
which
have
been
produced
the
genius
of
conquest
can
only
be
regarded
as
the
genius
of
destruction
what
a
sad
picture
was
often
presented
to
my
eyes
i
was
continually
doomed
to
hear
complaints
of
the
general
distress
and
to
execute
orders
which
augmented
the
immense
sacrifices
already
made
by
the
city
of
hamburg
thus
for
example
the
emperor
desired
me
to
furnish
him
with
cloaks
which
i
immediately
did
i
felt
the
importance
of
such
an
order
with
the
approach
of
winter
and
in
a
climate
the
rigour
of
which
our
troops
had
not
yet
encountered
i
also
received
orders
to
seize
at
lubeck
which
town
as
i
have
already
stated
had
been
alternately
taken
and
retaken
try
blucher
and
bernadotte
lasts
of
corn
a
last
weighs
kilogrammes
and
to
send
them
to
magdeburg
this
corn
belonged
to
russia
marshal
mortier
too
had
seized
some
timber
for
building
which
also
belonged
to
russia
and
which
was
estimated
at
francs
meanwhile
our
troops
continued
to
advance
with
such
rapidity
that
before
the
end
of
november
murat
arrived
at
warsaw
at
the
head
of
the
advanced
guard
of
the
grand
army
of
which
he
had
the
command
the
headquarters
were
then
at
posen
and
he
received
deputations
from
all
parts
soliciting
the
and
independence
of
the
kingdom
of
poland
rapp
informed
me
that
after
receiving
the
deputation
from
warsaw
the
emperor
said
to
him
i
love
the
poles
their
enthusiastic
character
pleases
me
i
should
like
to
make
them
independent
but
that
is
a
difficult
matter
austria
russia
and
prussia
have
all
had
a
slice
of
the
cake
when
the
match
is
once
kindled
who
knows
where
the
conflagration
may
stop
my
first
duty
is
towards
france
which
i
must
not
sacrifice
to
poland
we
must
refer
this
matter
to
the
sovereign
of
all
things
time
he
will
presently
show
us
what
we
must
do
had
sulkowsky
lived
napoleon
might
have
recollected
what
he
had
said
to
him
in
egypt
and
in
all
probability
he
would
have
raised
up
a
power
the
dismemberment
of
which
towards
the
close
of
the
last
century
began
to
overturn
the
political
equilibrium
which
had
subsisted
in
europe
since
the
peace
of
westphalia
in
it
was
at
the
headquarters
at
posen
that
duroc
rejoined
the
emperor
after
his
mission
to
the
king
of
prussia
his
carriage
overturned
on
the
way
and
he
had
the
misfortune
to
break
his
all
the
letters
i
received
were
nothing
but
a
succession
of
complaints
on
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
our
troops
were
absolutely
fighting
in
mud
and
it
was
with
extreme
difficulty
that
the
artillery
and
caissons
of
the
army
could
be
moved
along
de
talleyrand
had
been
summoned
to
headquarters
by
the
emperor
in
the
expectation
of
treating
for
peace
and
i
was
informed
that
his
carriage
stuck
in
the
mud
and
he
was
detained
on
his
journey
for
twelve
hours
a
soldier
having
asked
one
of
the
persons
in
de
talleyrand
suite
who
the
traveller
was
was
informed
that
he
was
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
ah
bah
said
the
soldier
why
does
he
come
with
his
diplomacy
to
such
a
devil
of
a
country
as
this
the
emperor
entered
warsaw
on
the
of
january
most
of
the
reports
which
he
had
received
previous
to
his
entrance
had
concurred
in
describing
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
troops
who
for
some
time
had
had
to
contend
with
bad
roads
bad
weather
and
all
aorta
of
privations
bonaparte
said
to
the
generals
who
informed
him
that
the
enthusiasm
of
his
troops
had
been
succeeded
by
dejection
and
discontent
does
their
spirit
fail
them
when
they
come
in
sight
of
the
enemy
no
sire
i
knew
it
my
troops
are
always
the
same
then
turning
to
rapp
he
said
i
must
rouse
them
and
he
dictated
the
following
proclamation
soldiers
it
is
a
year
this
very
hour
since
you
were
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
where
the
russian
battalions
fled
in
disorder
or
surrendered
up
their
arms
to
their
conquerors
next
day
proposals
of
peace
were
talked
of
but
they
were
deceptive
no
sooner
had
the
russians
escaped
by
perhaps
blamable
generosity
from
the
disasters
of
the
third
coalition
than
they
contrived
a
fourth
but
the
ally
on
whose
tactics
they
founded
their
principal
hope
was
no
more
his
capital
his
fortresses
his
magazines
his
arsenals
flags
and
have
fallen
into
our
power
the
oder
the
wartha
the
deserts
of
poland
and
the
inclemency
of
the
season
have
not
for
a
moment
retarded
your
progress
you
have
braved
all
surmounted
all
every
obstacle
has
fled
at
your
approach
the
russians
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
defend
the
capital
of
ancient
and
illustrious
poland
the
french
eagle
hovers
over
the
vistula
the
brave
and
unfortunate
poles
on
beholding
you
fancied
they
saw
the
legions
of
sobieski
returning
from
their
memorable
expedition
soldiers
we
will
not
lay
down
our
arms
until
a
general
peace
has
secured
the
power
of
our
allies
and
restored
to
us
our
colonies
and
our
freedom
of
trade
we
have
gained
on
the
elbe
and
the
oder
pondicherry
our
indian
establishments
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
the
spanish
colonies
why
should
the
russians
have
the
right
of
opposing
destiny
and
thwarting
our
just
designs
they
and
we
are
still
the
soldiers
who
fought
at
austerlitz
rapp
thus
describes
the
entrance
of
the
french
into
warsaw
and
adds
a
few
anecdotes
connected
with
that
event
at
length
we
entered
the
polish
capital
the
king
of
naples
had
preceded
us
and
had
driven
the
russians
from
the
city
napoleon
was
received
with
enthusiasm
the
poles
thought
that
the
moment
of
their
regeneration
had
arrived
and
that
their
wishes
were
fulfilled
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
joy
thus
evinced
and
the
respect
with
which
they
treated
us
the
french
troops
however
were
not
quite
so
well
pleased
they
manifested
the
greatest
repugnance
to
crossing
the
vistula
the
idea
of
want
and
bad
weather
had
inspired
them
with
the
greatest
aversion
to
poland
and
they
were
inexhaustible
in
their
jokes
on
the
country
when
bonaparte
dictated
his
proclamations
and
how
many
have
i
not
written
from
his
dictation
he
was
for
the
moment
inspired
and
he
evinced
all
the
excitement
which
distinguishes
the
italian
improvisatori
to
follow
him
it
was
necessary
to
write
with
inconceivable
rapidity
when
i
have
read
over
to
him
what
he
has
dictated
i
have
often
known
him
to
smile
triumphantly
at
the
effect
which
he
expected
any
particular
phrase
would
produce
in
general
his
proclamations
turned
on
three
distinct
points
praising
his
soldiers
for
what
they
had
done
pointing
out
to
them
what
they
had
yet
to
do
and
abusing
his
enemies
the
proclamation
to
which
i
have
just
now
alluded
was
circulated
profusely
through
germany
and
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
effect
it
produced
on
the
whole
army
the
corps
stationed
in
the
rear
burned
too
pass
by
forced
marches
the
space
which
still
separated
them
from
headquarters
and
those
who
were
nearer
the
emperor
forgot
their
fatigues
and
privations
and
were
only
anxious
to
encounter
the
enemy
they
frequently
could
not
understand
what
napoleon
said
in
these
proclamations
but
no
matter
for
that
they
would
have
followed
him
cheerfully
barefooted
and
without
provisions
such
was
the
enthusiasm
or
rather
the
fanaticism
which
napoleon
could
inspire
among
his
troops
when
he
thought
proper
to
rouse
them
as
he
termed
it
when
on
a
former
occasion
i
spoke
of
the
duke
of
and
his
family
i
forgot
a
circumstance
respecting
my
intercourse
with
him
which
now
occurs
to
my
memory
when
on
his
expulsion
from
his
states
after
the
battle
of
jena
he
took
refuge
in
altona
he
requested
through
the
medium
of
his
minister
at
hamburg
count
von
plessen
that
i
would
give
him
permission
occasionally
to
visit
that
city
this
permission
i
granted
without
hesitation
but
the
duke
observed
no
precaution
in
his
visits
and
i
made
some
friendly
observations
to
him
on
the
subject
i
knew
the
object
of
his
visits
it
was
a
secret
connection
in
hamburg
but
in
consequence
of
my
observations
he
removed
the
lady
to
altona
and
assured
me
that
he
adopted
that
determination
to
avoid
committing
me
he
afterwards
came
very
seldom
to
hamburg
but
as
we
were
on
the
best
understanding
with
denmark
i
frequently
saw
his
daughter
and
who
used
to
visit
me
at
a
house
i
had
in
holstein
near
altona
there
i
likewise
saw
almost
every
day
the
duke
of
weimar
an
excellent
old
man
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
on
such
terms
of
intimacy
with
him
that
my
house
was
in
some
measure
his
he
also
had
lost
his
states
i
was
so
happy
as
to
contribute
to
their
restitution
for
my
situation
enabled
me
to
exercise
some
influence
on
the
political
indulgences
or
severities
of
the
government
i
entertained
a
sincere
regard
for
the
duke
of
weimar
and
i
greatly
regretted
his
departure
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
in
berlin
than
he
wrote
me
a
letter
of
thanks
to
which
he
added
the
present
of
a
diamond
in
token
of
his
grateful
remembrance
of
me
the
duke
of
mecklenburg
was
not
so
fortunate
as
the
duke
of
weimar
in
spite
of
his
alliance
with
the
reigning
family
of
denmark
he
was
obliged
to
remain
at
altona
until
the
july
following
for
his
states
were
restored
only
by
the
treaty
of
tilsit
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
emperor
had
returns
to
paris
the
duke
son
the
hereditary
prince
visited
me
in
hamburg
and
asked
me
whether
i
thought
he
could
present
himself
to
the
emperor
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
his
own
and
his
father
gratitude
he
was
a
very
young
man
he
set
out
accompanied
by
oertzen
and
baron
von
brandstaten
some
time
afterwards
i
saw
his
name
in
the
moniteur
in
one
of
the
lists
of
presentations
to
napoleon
the
collection
of
which
during
the
empire
might
be
regarded
as
a
general
register
of
the
nobility
of
europe
it
is
commonly
said
that
we
may
accustom
ourselves
to
anything
but
to
me
this
remark
is
subject
to
an
exception
for
in
spite
of
the
necessity
to
which
i
was
reduced
of
employing
spies
i
never
could
surmount
the
disgust
i
felt
at
them
especially
when
i
saw
men
destined
to
fill
a
respectable
rank
in
society
degrade
themselves
to
that
infamous
profession
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
artifices
to
which
these
men
resort
to
gain
the
confidence
of
those
whom
they
wish
to
betray
of
this
the
following
example
just
now
occurs
to
my
mind
one
of
those
wretches
who
are
employed
in
certain
circumstances
and
by
all
parties
came
to
offer
his
services
to
me
his
name
was
butler
and
he
had
been
sent
from
england
to
the
continent
as
a
spy
upon
the
french
government
he
immediately
came
to
me
complaining
of
pretended
enemies
and
unjust
treatment
he
told
me
he
had
the
greatest
wish
to
serve
the
emperor
and
that
he
would
make
any
sacrifice
to
prove
his
fidelity
the
real
motive
of
his
change
of
party
was
as
it
is
with
all
such
men
merely
the
hope
of
a
higher
reward
most
extraordinary
were
the
schemes
he
adopted
to
prevent
his
old
employers
from
suspecting
that
he
was
serving
new
ones
to
me
he
continually
repeated
how
happy
he
was
to
be
revenged
on
his
enemies
in
london
he
asked
me
to
allow
him
to
go
to
paris
to
be
examined
by
the
minister
of
police
the
better
to
keep
up
the
deception
he
requested
that
on
his
arrival
in
paris
he
might
be
confined
in
the
temple
and
that
there
might
be
inserted
in
the
french
journals
an
announcement
in
the
following
terms
john
butler
commonly
called
count
butler
has
just
been
arrested
and
sent
to
paris
under
a
good
escort
by
the
french
minister
at
hamburg
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
weeks
butler
having
received
his
instruction
set
out
for
london
but
by
way
of
precaution
he
said
it
would
be
well
to
publish
in
the
journals
another
announcement
which
was
as
follows
john
butler
who
has
been
arrested
in
hamburg
as
an
english
agent
and
conveyed
to
paris
is
ordered
to
quit
france
and
the
territories
occupied
by
the
french
armies
and
their
allies
and
not
to
appear
there
again
until
the
general
peace
in
england
butler
enjoyed
the
honours
of
french
prosecution
he
was
regarded
as
a
victim
who
deserved
all
the
confidence
of
the
enemies
of
france
he
furnished
fouche
with
a
considerable
amount
of
information
and
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
escape
being
hanged
notwithstanding
the
pretended
necessity
of
employing
secret
agents
bonaparte
was
unwilling
that
even
under
that
pretext
too
many
communications
should
be
established
between
france
and
england
fouche
nevertheless
actively
directed
the
evolutions
of
his
secret
army
ever
ready
to
seize
on
anything
that
could
give
importance
to
the
police
and
encourage
the
suspicions
of
the
emperor
fouche
wrote
to
me
that
the
government
had
received
certain
information
that
many
frenchmen
traveling
for
commercial
houses
in
france
were
at
manchester
purchasing
articles
of
english
manufacture
this
was
true
but
how
was
it
to
be
prevented
these
traveling
clerks
passed
through
holland
where
they
easily
procured
a
passage
to
england
louis
bonaparte
conceiving
that
the
king
of
holland
ought
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
his
new
subjects
to
the
wishes
of
his
brother
was
at
first
very
lenient
as
to
the
disastrous
continental
system
but
at
this
napoleon
soon
manifested
his
displeasure
and
about
the
end
of
the
year
louis
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
ordering
the
strict
observance
of
the
blockade
the
facility
with
which
the
travelers
of
french
commercial
houses
passed
from
holland
to
england
gave
rise
to
other
alarms
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
it
was
said
that
since
frenchmen
could
so
easily
pass
from
the
continent
to
great
britain
the
agents
of
the
english
cabinet
might
by
the
same
means
find
their
way
to
the
continent
accordingly
the
consuls
were
directed
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
not
only
upon
individuals
who
evidently
came
from
england
but
upon
those
who
might
by
any
possibility
come
from
that
country
this
plan
was
all
very
well
but
how
was
it
to
be
put
into
execution
the
continent
was
nevertheless
inundated
with
articles
of
english
manufacture
for
this
simple
reason
that
however
powerful
may
be
the
will
of
a
sovereign
it
is
still
less
powerful
and
less
lasting
than
the
wants
of
a
people
the
continental
system
reminded
me
of
the
law
created
by
an
ancient
legislator
who
for
a
crime
which
he
conceived
could
not
possibly
be
committed
condemned
the
person
who
should
be
guilty
of
it
to
throw
a
bull
over
mount
taurus
it
is
not
my
present
design
to
trace
a
picture
of
the
state
of
europe
at
the
close
of
i
will
merely
throw
together
a
few
facts
which
came
to
my
knowledge
at
the
time
and
which
i
find
in
my
correspondence
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
emperor
arrived
at
warsaw
on
the
of
january
during
his
stay
at
posen
he
had
by
virtue
of
a
treaty
concluded
with
the
elector
of
saxony
founded
a
new
kingdom
and
consequently
extended
his
power
in
germany
by
the
annexation
of
the
new
kingdom
of
saxony
to
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
by
the
terms
of
this
treaty
saxony
so
justly
famed
for
her
cavalry
was
to
furnish
the
emperor
with
a
contingent
of
men
and
horses
it
was
quite
a
new
spectacle
to
the
princes
of
germany
all
accustomed
to
old
habits
of
etiquette
to
see
an
upstart
sovereign
treat
them
as
subjects
and
even
oblige
them
to
consider
themselves
as
such
those
famous
saxons
who
had
made
charlemagne
tremble
threw
themselves
on
the
protection
of
the
emperor
and
the
alliance
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
saxony
was
not
a
matter
of
indifference
to
napoleon
for
the
new
king
was
on
account
of
his
age
his
tastes
and
his
character
more
revered
than
any
other
german
prince
from
the
moment
of
napoleon
arrival
at
warsaw
until
the
commencement
of
hostilities
against
the
russians
he
was
continually
solicited
to
reestablish
the
throne
of
poland
and
to
restore
its
chivalrous
independence
to
the
ancient
empire
of
the
jagellons
a
person
who
was
at
that
time
in
warsaw
told
me
that
the
emperor
was
in
the
greatest
uncertainty
as
to
what
he
should
do
respecting
poland
he
was
entreated
to
reestablish
that
ancient
and
heroic
kingdom
but
he
came
to
no
decision
preferring
according
to
custom
to
submit
to
events
that
he
might
appear
to
command
them
at
warsaw
indeed
the
emperor
passed
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
fetes
and
reviews
which
however
did
not
prevent
him
from
watching
with
his
eagle
eye
every
department
of
the
public
service
both
interior
and
exterior
he
himself
was
in
the
capital
of
poland
but
his
vast
influence
was
present
everywhere
i
heard
duroc
say
when
we
were
conversing
together
about
the
campaign
of
tilsit
that
napoleon
activity
and
intelligence
were
never
more
conspicuously
developed
one
very
remarkable
feature
of
the
imperial
wars
was
that
with
the
exception
of
the
interior
police
of
which
fouche
was
the
soul
the
whole
government
of
france
was
at
the
headquarters
of
the
emperor
at
warsaw
napoleon
attention
was
not
only
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
his
army
but
he
directed
the
whole
machinery
of
the
french
government
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
in
paris
daily
estafettes
and
frequently
the
useless
auditors
of
the
council
of
state
brought
him
reports
more
or
less
correct
and
curious
disclosures
which
were
frequently
the
invention
of
the
police
the
portfolios
of
the
ministers
arrived
every
week
with
the
exception
of
those
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
the
minister
of
the
war
department
the
former
had
first
stopped
at
mayence
with
the
empress
but
had
been
called
on
to
warsaw
and
the
latter
clarke
was
for
the
misfortune
of
berlin
governor
of
that
city
this
state
of
things
lasted
during
the
ten
months
of
the
emperor
absence
from
paris
louis
xiv
said
i
am
myself
the
state
napoleon
did
not
say
this
but
in
fact
under
his
reign
the
government
of
france
was
always
at
his
headquarters
this
circumstance
had
proved
fatal
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
the
extraordinary
conspiracy
of
malet
with
some
points
of
which
i
alone
perhaps
am
thoroughly
acquainted
the
emperor
employed
the
month
of
january
in
military
preparations
for
the
approaching
attack
of
the
russians
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
neglect
the
business
of
the
cabinet
with
him
nothing
was
suffered
to
linger
in
arrear
while
napoleon
was
at
warsaw
a
battle
was
not
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
about
affairs
were
much
more
complicated
than
during
the
campaign
of
vienna
it
was
necessary
on
the
one
hand
to
observe
prussia
which
was
occupied
and
on
the
other
to
anticipate
the
russians
whose
movements
indicated
that
they
were
inclined
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
the
preceding
campaign
austria
before
the
taking
of
vienna
was
engaged
alone
the
case
was
different
now
austria
had
had
only
soldiers
and
prussia
as
blucher
declared
to
me
was
beginning
to
have
citizens
there
was
no
difficulty
in
returning
from
vienna
but
a
great
deal
in
returning
from
warsaw
in
case
of
failure
notwithstanding
the
creation
of
the
kingdom
of
saxony
and
the
provisional
government
given
to
prussia
and
to
the
other
states
of
germany
which
we
had
conquered
none
of
these
considerations
escaped
the
penetration
of
napoleon
nothing
was
omitted
in
the
notes
letters
and
official
correspondence
which
came
to
me
from
all
quarters
receiving
as
i
did
accurate
information
from
my
own
correspondents
of
all
that
was
passing
in
germany
it
often
happened
that
i
transmitted
to
the
government
the
same
news
which
it
transmitted
to
me
not
supposing
that
i
previously
knew
it
thus
for
example
i
thought
i
was
apprising
the
government
of
the
arming
of
austria
of
which
i
received
information
from
headquarters
a
few
days
after
during
the
prussian
campaign
austria
played
precisely
the
same
waiting
game
which
prussia
had
played
clueing
the
campaign
of
austria
as
prussia
had
before
the
battle
of
austerlitz
awaited
the
success
or
defeat
of
the
french
to
decide
whether
she
should
remain
neutral
or
declare
herself
against
france
so
austria
doubtless
supposing
that
russia
would
be
more
fortunate
as
the
ally
of
prussia
than
she
had
been
as
her
ally
assembled
a
corps
of
men
in
bohemia
that
corps
was
called
an
army
of
observation
but
the
nature
of
these
armies
of
observation
is
well
known
they
belong
to
the
class
of
armed
neutralities
like
the
ingenious
invention
of
sanitary
cordons
the
fact
is
that
the
men
assembled
in
bohemia
were
destined
to
aid
and
assist
the
russians
in
case
they
should
be
successful
and
who
can
blame
the
austrian
government
for
wishing
to
wash
away
the
shame
of
the
treaty
of
presburg
napoleon
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
but
this
activity
required
no
spur
he
had
hastened
the
battle
of
austerlitz
to
anticipate
prussia
and
he
now
found
it
necessary
to
anticipate
russia
in
order
to
keep
austria
in
a
state
of
indecision
the
emperor
therefore
left
warsaw
about
the
end
of
january
and
immediately
gave
orders
for
engaging
the
russian
army
in
the
beginning
of
february
but
in
spite
of
his
desire
of
commencing
the
attack
he
was
anticipated
on
the
of
february
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
was
attacked
by
the
russians
who
advanced
during
a
terrible
storm
of
snow
which
fell
in
large
flakes
they
approached
where
the
emperor
was
and
the
imperial
guard
stopped
the
russian
column
nearly
the
whole
french
army
was
engaged
in
that
of
the
most
sanguinary
ever
fought
in
europe
the
corps
commanded
by
bernadotte
was
not
engaged
in
the
contest
it
had
been
stationed
on
the
left
at
mohrungen
whence
it
menaced
dantzic
the
issue
of
the
battle
would
have
been
very
different
had
the
four
divisions
of
infantry
and
the
two
of
cavalry
composing
bernadotte
corps
arrived
in
time
but
unfortunately
the
officer
instructed
to
convey
orders
to
bernadotte
to
march
without
delay
on
was
taken
by
a
body
of
cossacks
bernadotte
therefore
did
not
arrive
bonaparte
who
always
liked
to
throw
blame
on
some
one
if
things
did
not
turn
out
exactly
as
he
wished
attributed
the
doubtful
success
of
the
day
to
the
absence
of
bernadotte
in
this
he
was
right
but
to
make
his
absence
a
reproach
to
that
marshal
was
a
gross
injustice
bernadotte
was
accused
of
not
having
been
willing
to
march
on
though
as
it
was
alleged
general
had
informed
him
of
the
necessity
of
his
presence
but
how
can
that
fact
be
ascertained
since
general
was
killed
on
that
same
day
who
can
assure
us
that
that
general
had
been
able
to
communicate
with
the
marshal
those
who
knew
bonaparte
his
cunning
and
the
artful
advantage
he
would
sometimes
take
of
words
which
he
attributed
to
the
dead
will
easily
solve
the
enigma
the
battle
of
eylau
was
terrible
night
came
bernadotte
corps
was
instantly
but
in
vain
expected
and
after
a
great
loss
the
french
army
had
the
melancholy
honour
of
passing
the
night
on
the
field
of
battle
bernadotte
at
length
arrived
but
too
late
he
met
the
enemy
who
were
retreating
without
the
fear
of
being
molested
towards
konigsberg
the
only
capital
remaining
to
prussia
the
king
of
prussia
was
then
at
memel
a
small
port
on
the
baltic
thirty
leagues
from
konigsberg
after
the
battle
of
eylau
both
sides
remained
stationary
and
several
days
elapsed
without
anything
remarkable
taking
place
the
offers
of
peace
made
by
the
emperor
with
very
little
earnestness
it
is
true
were
disdainfully
rejected
as
if
a
victory
disputed
with
napoleon
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
triumph
the
battle
of
eylau
seemed
to
turn
the
heads
of
the
russians
who
chanted
te
deum
on
the
occasion
but
while
the
emperor
was
making
preparations
to
advance
his
diplomacy
was
taking
effect
in
a
distant
quarter
and
raising
up
against
russia
an
old
and
formidable
enemy
turkey
declared
war
against
her
this
was
a
powerful
diversion
and
obliged
russia
to
strip
her
western
frontiers
to
secure
a
line
of
defence
on
the
south
some
time
after
general
gardanne
set
out
on
the
famous
embassy
to
persia
for
which
the
way
had
been
paved
by
the
success
of
the
mission
of
my
friend
amedee
jaubert
this
embassy
was
not
merely
one
of
those
pompous
legations
such
as
charlemagne
louis
and
louis
xvi
received
from
the
empress
irene
the
king
of
siam
and
tippoo
saib
it
was
connected
with
ideas
which
bonaparte
had
conceived
at
the
very
dawn
of
his
power
it
was
indeed
the
light
from
the
east
which
fast
enabled
him
to
see
his
greatness
in
perspective
and
that
light
never
ceased
to
fix
his
attention
and
dazzle
his
imagination
i
know
well
that
embassy
was
at
first
conceived
on
a
much
grander
scale
than
that
on
which
it
was
executed
napoleon
had
resolved
to
send
to
the
shah
of
persia
infantry
commanded
by
chosen
and
experienced
officers
muskets
and
pieces
of
cannon
and
i
also
know
that
orders
were
given
for
the
execution
of
this
design
the
avowed
object
of
the
emperor
was
to
enable
the
shah
of
persia
to
make
an
important
diversion
with
men
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
russia
but
there
was
likewise
another
an
old
and
constant
object
which
was
always
uppermost
in
napoleon
mind
namely
the
wish
to
strike
at
england
in
the
very
heart
of
her
asiatic
possessions
such
vas
the
principal
motive
of
mission
but
circumstances
did
not
permit
the
emperor
to
give
it
all
the
importance
he
desired
he
contented
himself
with
sending
a
few
officers
of
engineers
and
artillery
to
persia
who
on
their
arrival
were
astonished
at
the
number
of
english
they
found

only
be
