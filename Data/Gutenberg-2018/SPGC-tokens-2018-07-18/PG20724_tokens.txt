dedication
of
the
first
edition
a
dear
leypoldt
you
have
not
forgotten
that
nearly
two
years
ago
before
our
business
connection
was
thought
of
this
identical
translation
was
declined
by
you
with
that
same
courtesy
the
exercise
of
which
in
frequent
similar
cases
each
one
of
us
now
tries
so
hard
to
shove
on
the
other
shoulders
i
hope
that
your
surprise
on
reading
this
note
of
dedication
will
not
interfere
with
your
forgiving
the
pertinacity
with
which
through
it
i
still
strive
to
make
the
book
broome

footnote
a
published
by
leypoldt

the
translator
has
placed
a
few
explanatory
notes
at
the
end
of
the
volume
they
are
referred
to
by
numbers
in
the

the
man

the
broken

chapter
wherein
they
kill
the
fatted
calf
to
celebrate
the
return
of
a
frugal
son
on
the
of
may
renault
formerly
professor
of
physics
and
chemistry
now
a
landed
proprietor
at
fontainebleau
and
member
of
the
municipal
council
of
that
charming
little
city
himself
carried
to
the
the
following
letter
monsieur
leon
renault
civil
engineer
berlin
to
be
kept
at
the
till
called
for
my
dear
child
the
good
news
you
sent
us
from
petersburg
caused
us
the
greatest
joy
your
poor
mother
had
been
ailing
since
winter
but
i
had
not
spoken
to
you
about
it
from
fear
of
making
you
uneasy
while
so
far
from
home
as
for
myself
i
had
not
been
very
well
and
there
was
yet
a
third
person
guess
the
name
if
you
can
who
was
languishing
from
not
seeing
you
but
content
yourself
my
dear
leon
we
have
been
recuperating
more
and
more
since
the
time
of
your
return
is
almost
fixed
we
begin
to
believe
that
the
mines
of
the
ural
will
not
swallow
up
that
which
is
dearer
to
us
than
all
the
world
thank
god
that
fortune
which
you
have
so
honorably
and
so
quickly
made
will
not
have
cost
your
life
nor
even
your
health
since
you
tell
us
you
have
been
growing
fat
off
there
in
the
desert
if
you
have
not
finished
up
all
your
business
out
there
so
much
the
worse
for
you
there
are
three
of
us
who
have
sworn
that
you
shall
never
go
back
again
you
will
not
find
it
hard
to
accede
for
you
will
be
happy
among
us
such
at
least
is
the
opinion
of
clementine
i
forget
that
i
was
pledged
not
to
name
her
master
bonnivet
our
excellent
neighbor
has
not
rested
content
with
investing
your
funds
in
a
good
mortgage
but
has
also
drawn
up
in
his
leisure
moments
a
most
edifying
little
indenture
which
now
lacks
nothing
but
your
signature
our
worthy
mayor
has
ordered
on
your
account
a
new
official
scarf
which
is
on
the
way
from
paris
you
will
have
the
first
benefit
of
it
your
apartment
which
will
soon
belong
to
a
plural
is
elegant
in
proportion
to
your
present
fortune
you
are
to
occupy
but
the
house
has
changed
so
in
three
years
that
my
description
would
be
incomprehensible
to
you
audret
the
architect
of
the
imperial
chateau
directed
the
work
he
actually
wanted
to
construct
me
a
laboratory
worthy
of
thénard
or
duprez
i
earnestly
protested
against
it
and
said
that
i
was
not
yet
worthy
of
one
as
my
celebrated
work
on
the
condensation
of
gases
had
only
reached
the
fourth
chapter
but
as
your
mother
was
in
collusion
with
the
old
scamp
of
a
friend
it
has
turned
out
that
science
has
henceforth
a
temple
in
our
house
a
regular
sorcerer
den
according
to
the
picturesque
expression
of
your
old
gothon
it
lacks
nothing
not
even
a
steam
engine
alas
what
can
i
do
with
it
i
am
confident
nevertheless
that
the
expenditure
will
not
be
altogether
lost
to
the
world
you
are
not
going
to
sleep
upon
your
laurels
oh
if
i
had
only
had
your
fortune
when
i
had
your
youth
i
would
have
dedicated
my
days
to
pure
science
instead
of
losing
the
best
part
of
them
among
those
poor
young
men
who
got
nothing
from
my
lectures
but
an
opportunity
to
read
paul
de
kock
i
would
have
been
ambitious
i
would
have
striven
to
connect
my
name
with
the
discovery
of
some
great
general
law
or
at
least
with
the
invention
of
some
very
useful
apparatus
it
is
too
late
now
my
eyes
are
worn
out
and
the
brain
itself
refuses
to
work
take
your
turn
my
boy
you
are
not
yet
the
ural
mines
have
given
you
the
wherewithal
to
live
at
ease
and
for
yourself
alone
you
have
no
further
wants
to
satisfy
the
time
has
come
to
work
for
humanity
that
you
will
do
so
is
the
strongest
wish
and
dearest
hope
of
your
doting
old
father
who
loves
you
and
who
waits
for
you
with
open
arms
renault
according
to
my
calculations
this
letter
ought
to
reach
berlin
two
or
three
days
before
you
you
have
been
already
informed
by
the
papers
of
the
inst
of
the
death
of
the
illustrious
humboldt
it
is
a
cause
of
mourning
to
science
and
to
humanity
i
have
had
the
honor
of
writing
to
that
great
man
several
times
in
my
life
and
he
once
deigned
to
reply
in
a
letter
which
i
piously
cherish
if
you
happen
to
have
an
opportunity
to
buy
some
personal
souvenir
of
him
a
bit
of
his
handwriting
or
some
fragment
of
his
collections
you
will
bring
me
a
real
pleasure
a
month
after
the
departure
of
this
letter
the
son
so
eagerly
looked
for
returned
to
the
paternal
mansion
and
mme
renault
who
went
to
meet
him
at
the
depot
found
him
taller
stouter
and
in
every
way
in
fact
he
was
no
longer
merely
a
remarkable
boy
but
a
man
of
good
and
pleasing
proportions
leon
renault
was
of
medium
height
light
hair
and
complexion
plump
and
well
made
his
large
blue
eyes
sweet
voice
and
silken
beard
indicated
a
nature
sensitive
rather
than
powerful
a
very
white
round
and
almost
feminine
neck
contrasted
singularly
with
a
face
bronzed
by
exposure
his
teeth
were
beautiful
very
delicate
a
little
inclined
backward
and
very
evenly
shaped
when
he
pulled
off
his
gloves
he
displayed
two
small
and
rather
pudgey
hands
quite
firm
and
yet
pleasantly
soft
neither
hot
nor
cold
nor
dry
nor
damp
but
agreeable
to
the
touch
and
to
perfection
as
he
was
his
father
and
mother
would
not
have
exchanged
him
for
the
apollo
belvedere
they
embraced
him
rapturously
overwhelming
him
with
a
thousand
questions
most
of
which
he
of
course
failed
to
answer
some
old
friends
of
the
family
a
doctor
an
architect
and
a
notary
had
run
to
the
depot
with
the
good
old
people
each
one
of
them
in
turn
gave
him
a
hug
and
asked
him
if
he
was
well
and
if
he
had
had
a
pleasant
journey
he
listened
patiently
and
even
joyfully
to
this
music
whose
words
did
not
signify
much
but
whose
melody
went
to
the
heart
because
it
came
from
the
heart
they
had
been
there
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
the
train
had
gone
puffing
on
its
way
the
omnibuses
of
the
various
hotels
had
started
one
after
another
at
a
good
trot
up
the
street
leading
to
the
city
and
the
june
sun
seemed
to
enjoy
lighting
up
this
happy
group
of
excellent
people
but
madame
renault
cried
out
all
at
once
that
the
poor
child
must
be
dying
of
hunger
and
that
it
was
barbarous
to
keep
him
waiting
for
his
dinner
any
longer
there
was
no
use
in
his
protesting
that
he
had
breakfasted
at
paris
and
that
the
voice
of
hunger
appealed
to
him
less
strongly
than
that
of
joy
they
all
got
into
two
carriages
the
son
beside
his
mother
the
father
opposite
as
if
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
his
boy
a
wagon
came
behind
with
the
trunks
long
boxes
chests
and
the
rest
of
the
traveller
baggage
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
the
hackmen
cracked
their
whips
the
followed
the
example
and
this
cheerful
clatter
drew
the
people
to
their
doors
and
woke
up
for
an
instant
the
quietude
of
the
streets
madame
renault
threw
her
glances
right
and
left
searching
out
the
spectators
of
her
triumph
and
saluting
with
most
cordial
affability
people
she
hardly
knew
at
all
and
more
than
one
mother
saluted
her
too
without
knowing
her
for
there
is
no
mother
indifferent
to
such
kinds
of
happiness
and
moreover
leon
family
was
liked
by
everybody
and
the
neighbors
meeting
each
other
said
with
a
satisfaction
free
from
jealousy
that
is
renault
son
who
has
been
at
work
three
years
in
the
russian
mines
and
now
has
come
to
share
his
fortune
with
his
old
parents
leon
also
noticed
several
familiar
faces
but
not
all
that
he
wished
to
see
for
he
bent
over
an
instant
to
his
mother
ear
saying
and
clementine
this
word
was
pronounced
so
low
and
so
close
that
renault
himself
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
a
word
or
a
kiss
the
good
lady
smiled
tenderly
and
answered
but
a
single
word
patience
as
if
patience
were
a
virtue
very
common
among
lovers
the
door
of
the
house
was
wide
open
and
old
gothon
was
standing
on
the
threshold
she
raised
her
arms
toward
heaven
and
cried
like
a
booby
for
she
had
known
leon
since
he
was
not
much
higher
than
her
there
was
now
another
formidable
hugging
on
the
upper
step
between
the
good
old
servant
and
her
young
master
after
a
reasonable
interval
the
friends
of
renault
prepared
to
leave
but
it
was
wasted
pains
for
they
were
assured
that
their
places
at
table
had
already
been
prepared
and
when
all
save
the
invisible
clementine
were
reassembled
in
the
parlor
the
great
chairs
held
out
their
arms
to
the
scion
of
the
house
of
renault
the
old
mirror
on
the
mantle
delighted
to
reflect
his
image
the
great
chandelier
chimed
a
little
song
of
welcome
with
its
crystal
pendants
and
the
mandarins
on
the
etagére
shook
their
heads
in
sign
of
welcome
as
if
they
were
orthodox
instead
of
strangers
and
pagans
no
one
can
tell
why
kisses
and
tears
began
to
rain
down
again
but
it
certainly
did
seem
as
if
he
had
once
more
just
returned
soup
cried
gothon
madame
renault
took
the
arm
of
her
son
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
etiquette
and
without
even
apologizing
to
the
honored
guests
present
she
scarcely
excused
herself
even
for
helping
the
son
before
the
company
leon
let
her
have
her
own
way
and
took
it
all
smilingly
there
was
not
a
guest
there
who
was
not
ready
to
upset
his
soup
over
his
waistcoat
rather
than
taste
it
before
leon
mother
cried
leon
spoon
in
hand
this
is
the
first
time
for
three
years
that
i
tasted
good
soup
madame
renault
felt
herself
blush
with
satisfaction
and
gothon
was
so
overcome
that
she
dropped
a
plate
both
fancied
that
possibly
he
had
spoken
to
please
their
but
nevertheless
he
spoke
truly
there
are
two
things
in
this
world
which
a
man
does
not
often
find
away
from
home
the
first
is
good
soup
the
second
is
disinterested
love
if
i
should
attempt
here
an
accurate
enumeration
of
all
the
dishes
that
appeared
on
the
table
there
would
not
be
one
of
my
readers
whose
mouth
would
not
water
i
believe
indeed
that
more
than
one
delicate
lady
would
be
in
danger
of
an
attack
of
indigestion
suppose
if
you
please
that
such
a
list
would
reach
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
volume
leaving
me
but
a
single
page
on
which
to
write
the
marvellous
history
of
fougas
therefore
i
forthwith
return
to
the
parlor
where
coffee
is
already
served
leon
took
scarcely
half
of
his
cup
but
do
not
let
that
lead
you
to
infer
that
the
coffee
was
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
too
sweet
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
prevented
his
drinking
it
to
the
last
drop
if
a
knock
at
the
had
not
stopped
it
just
opposite
his
heart
the
minute
which
followed
appeared
to
him
interminable
never
in
his
travels
had
he
encountered
such
a
long
minute
but
at
length
clementine
appeared
preceded
by
the
worthy
mlle
virginie
sambucco
her
aunt
and
the
mandarins
who
smiled
on
the
etagére
heard
the
sound
of
three
kisses
wherefore
three
the
superficial
reader
who
pretends
to
foresee
things
before
they
are
written
has
already
found
a
very
probable
explanation
of
course
says
he
leon
was
too
respectful
to
embrace
the
dignified
mlle
sambucco
more
than
once
but
when
he
came
to
clementine
who
was
soon
to
become
his
wife
he
very
properly
doubled
the
dose
now
sir
that
is
what
i
call
a
premature
judgment
the
first
kiss
fell
from
the
mouth
of
leon
upon
the
cheek
of
mlle
sambucco
the
second
was
applied
by
the
lips
of
mlle
sambucco
to
the
right
cheek
of
leon
the
third
was
in
fact
an
accident
that
plunged
two
young
hearts
into
profound
consternation
leon
who
was
very
much
in
love
with
his
betrothed
rushed
to
her
blindly
uncertain
whether
he
would
kiss
her
right
cheek
or
her
left
but
determined
not
to
put
off
too
long
a
pleasure
which
he
had
been
promising
himself
ever
since
the
spring
of
clementine
did
not
dream
of
defending
herself
but
was
fully
prepared
to
apply
her
pretty
rosy
lips
to
leon
right
cheek
or
his
left
indifferently
the
precipitation
of
the
two
young
people
brought
it
about
that
neither
clementine
cheeks
nor
leon
received
the
offering
intended
for
them
and
the
mandarins
on
the
etagére
who
fully
expected
to
hear
two
kisses
heard
but
one
and
leon
was
confounded
and
clementine
blushed
up
to
her
ears
and
the
two
lovers
retreated
a
step
intently
regarding
the
roses
of
the
carpet
which
will
remain
eternally
graven
upon
their
memories
in
the
eyes
of
leon
renault
clementine
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
he
had
loved
her
for
little
more
than
three
years
and
it
was
somewhat
on
her
account
that
he
had
taken
the
journey
to
russia
in
she
was
too
young
to
marry
and
too
rich
for
an
engineer
with
a
salary
of
francs
to
properly
make
pretentions
to
her
hand
leon
who
was
a
good
mathematician
proposed
to
himself
the
following
problem
given
one
young
girl
fifteen
and
a
half
years
old
with
an
income
of
francs
and
threatened
with
the
inheritance
from
mlle
sambucco
of
say
more
to
obtain
a
fortune
at
least
equal
to
hers
within
such
a
period
as
will
give
her
time
enough
to
grow
up
without
leaving
her
time
enough
to
become
an
old
maid
he
had
found
the
solution
in
the
ural
mines
during
three
long
years
he
had
indirectly
corresponded
with
the
beloved
of
his
heart
all
the
letters
which
he
wrote
to
his
father
or
mother
passed
into
the
hands
of
mlle
sambucco
who
did
not
keep
them
from
clementine
sometimes
indeed
they
were
read
aloud
in
the
family
and
renault
was
never
obliged
to
omit
a
phrase
for
leon
never
wrote
anything
which
a
young
girl
should
not
hear
the
aunt
and
the
niece
had
no
other
distractions
they
lived
retired
in
a
little
house
at
the
end
of
a
pretty
garden
and
received
no
one
but
old
friends
clementine
therefore
deserved
but
little
credit
for
keeping
her
heart
for
leon
with
the
exception
of
a
big
colonel
of
cuirassiers
who
sometimes
followed
her
in
her
walks
no
man
had
ever
made
any
demonstrations
toward
her
she
was
very
pretty
withal
and
not
so
merely
to
the
eyes
of
her
lover
or
of
the
renault
family
or
of
the
little
city
where
she
lived
provincial
towns
are
apt
to
be
easily
satisfied
they
give
the
reputation
of
being
a
pretty
woman
or
a
great
man
cheaply
especially
when
they
are
not
rich
enough
in
such
commodities
to
show
themselves
over
particular
in
capitals
however
people
claim
to
admire
nothing
but
absolute
merit
i
have
heard
the
mayor
of
a
village
say
with
a
certain
pride
admit
now
that
my
servant
catherine
is
right
pretty
for
a
village
of
six
hundred
people
clementine
was
pretty
enough
to
be
admired
in
a
city
of
eight
hundred
thousand
fancy
to
yourself
a
little
blonde
creole
with
black
eyes
creamy
complexion
and
dazzling
teeth
her
figure
was
round
and
supple
as
a
twig
and
was
finished
off
with
dainty
hands
and
pretty
andalusian
feet
arched
and
beautifully
rounded
all
her
glances
were
smiles
and
all
her
movements
caresses
add
to
this
that
she
was
neither
a
fool
nor
a
prude
nor
even
an
ignoramus
like
girls
brought
up
in
convents
her
education
which
was
begun
by
her
mother
had
been
completed
by
two
or
three
respectable
old
professors
selected
by
renault
who
was
her
guardian
she
had
a
sound
heart
and
a
quick
mind
but
i
may
reasonably
ask
myself
why
i
have
so
much
to
say
about
her
for
she
is
still
living
and
thank
god
not
one
of
her
perfections
has
departed

of

with

leon
protested
but
clementine
obeyed
though
not
without
pouting
a
little
already
the
parlor
door
was
open
and
the
old
lady
had
taken
her
hood
in
the
hall
when
the
engineer
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
exclaimed
you
surely
wo
go
without
helping
me
to
open
my
trunks
i
demand
it
of
you
as
a
favor
my
good
mademoiselle

the
respectable

urged
her
to

inclined
her
to

there

should
point
out
what
he
wanted
taken
to
his

the
whole
company
armed
with
lamps
and

betook
themselves
to
a
vast
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
furnaces
retorts
philosophical
instruments
boxes
trunks

bags
hat
boxes
and
the

formed
a
confused
and

spectacle
the
light
played
about
this
interior
as
it
appears
to
in
certain

grouped
in
the

of
the
boxes
some
sitting
some
standing

holding
a

another

detracted
nothing
from
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
leon
with
a
bunch
of
little
keys
opened
the
boxes
one
after
another
clementine
was
seated
opposite
him
on
a
great
oblong
box
and
watched
him
with
all
her
eyes
more
from
affection
than
curiosity
they
began
by
setting
to
one
side
two
enormous
square
boxes
which
contained
nothing
but
mineralogical
specimens
after
this
they
passed
in
review
the
riches
of
all
kinds
which
the
engineer
had
crowded
among
his
linen
and
clothing
a
pleasant
odor
of
russia
leather
tea
from
the
caravans
levant
tobacco
and
attar
of
roses
soon
permeated
the
laboratory
leon
brought
forth
a
little
at
a
time
as
is
the
custom
of
all
rich
travellers
who
on
leaving
home
left
a
family
and
good
stock
of
friends
behind
he
exhibited
in

fabrics
of
the

such
as
they

each
object
passed
from

to

amid
questions
explanations
and
interjections
of
all
kinds
all
the
friends
present
received
the
gifts
intended
for
them
there
was
a
concert
of
polite
refusals
friendly
urgings
and
in
all
sorts
of
voices
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
much
the
greater
share
fell
to
the
lot
of
clementine
but
she
did
not
wait
to
be
urged
to
accept
them
for
in
the
existing
state
of
affairs
all
these
pretty
things
would
be
but
as
a
part
of
the
wedding

not
going
out

had
brought
his

an
exceedingly
handsome
dressing
gown

embroidered
with

some
antiquarian
books
found
in
moscow
a
pretty
picture
by
greuze
which
had
been
stuck
out
of
the
way
by
the
luckiest
of
accidents
in
a
mean
shop
at
gastinitvor
two
magnificent
specimens
of
and
a
cane
that
had
belonged
to
humboldt
you
see
said
he
to
renault
on
handing
him
this
historic
staff
that
the
postscript
of
your
last
letter
did
not
fall
overboard
the
old
professor
received
the
present
with
visible
emotion
i
will
never
use
it
said
he
to
his
son
the
napoleon
of
science
has
held
it
in
his
hand
what
would
one
think
if
an
old
sergeant
like
me
should
permit
himself
to
carry
it
in
his
walks
in
the
woods
and
the
collections
were
you
not
able
to
buy
anything
from
them
did
they
sell
very
high
they
were
not
sold
answered
leon
all
were
placed
in
the
national
museum
at
berlin
but
in
my
eagerness
to
satisfy
you
i
made
a
thief
of
myself
in
a
strange
way
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
i
told
your
wish
to
a
guide
who
was
showing
me
the
place
he
told
me
that
a
friend
of
his
a
little
jew
broker
by
the
name
of
ritter
wanted
to
sell
a
very
fine
anatomical
specimen
that
had
belonged
to
the
estate
i
ran
to
the
jew
examined
the
mummy
for
such
it
was
and
without
any
haggling
paid
the
price
he
asked
but
the
next
day
a
friend
of
humboldt
professor
hirtz
told
me
the
history
of
this
shred
of
a
man
which
had
been
lying
around
the
shop
for
more
than
ten
years
and
never
belonged
to
humboldt
at
all
where
the
deuce
has
gothon
stowed
it
ah
mlle
clementine
is
sitting
on
it
clementine
attempted
to
rise
but
leon
made
her
keep
seated
we
have
plenty
of
time
said
he
to
take
a
look
at
the
old
baggage
meanwhile
you
can
well
imagine
that
it
is
not
a
very
cheerful
sight
this
is
the
history
that
good
old
hirtz
told
me
he
promised
to
send
me
in
addition
a
copy
of
a
very
curious
memoir
on
the
same
subject
do
go
yet
my
dear
mademoiselle
sambucco
i
have
a
little
military
and
scientific
romance
for
you
we
will
look
at
the
mummy
as
soon
as
i
have
acquainted
you
with
his
misfortunes
aha
cried
audret
the
architect
of
the
chateau
it
the
romance
of
the
mummy
is
it
that
you
going
to
tell
us
too
late
my
poor
leon
theophile
gautier
has
gotten
ahead
of
you
in
the
supplement
to
the
and
all
the
world
knows
your
egyptian
history
my
history
said
leon
is
no
more
egyptian
than
manon
lescault
our
excellent
doctor
martout
here
ought
to
know
the
name
of
professor
john
meiser
of
dantzic
he
lived
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
and
i
think
that
his
last
work
appeared
in
or
in
replied
martout
meiser
is
one
of
the
scientific
men
who
have
done
germany
most
honor
in
the
midst
of
terrible
wars
which
drenched
his
country
in
blood
he
followed
up
the
researches
of
leeuwenkoeck
baker
needham
fontana
and
spallanzani
on
the
revivification
of
animals
our
profession
honors
in
him
one
of
the
fathers
of
modern
biology
heavens
what
ugly
big
words
cried
mlle
sambucco
is
it
decent
to
keep
people
till
this
time
of
night
to
make
them
listen
to
dutch
do
listen
to
the
big
words
dear
little
auntey
save
yourself
for
the
romance
since
there
is
one
a
terrible
one
said
leon
mlle
clementine
is
seated
over
a
human
victim
sacrificed
to
science
by
professor
meiser
clementine
instantly
got
up
her
fiancé
handed
her
a
chair
and
seated
himself
in
the
place
she
had
just
left
the
listeners
fearing
that
leon
romance
might
be
in
several
volumes
took
their
places
around
him
some
on

some
on
chairs
chapter
iii
the
crime
of
the
learned
professor
meiser
ladies
said
leon
professor
meiser
was
no
vulgar
malefactor
but
a
man
devoted
to
science
and
humanity
if
he
killed
the
french
colonel
who
at
this
moment
reposes
beneath
my
coat
tails
it
was
for
the
sake
of
saving
his
life
as
well
as
of
throwing
light
on
a
question
of
the
deepest
interest
even
to
each
one
of
you
the
duration
of
our
existence
is
very
much
too
brief
that
is
a
fact
which
no
man
can
contradict
we
know
that
in
a
hundred
years
not
one
of
the
nine
or
ten
persons
assembled
in
this
house
will
be
living
on
the
face
of
the
earth
is
not
this
a
deplorable
fact
mlle
sambucco
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
and
leon
continued
alas
mademoiselle
like
you
i
have
sighed
many
a
time
at
the
contemplation
of
this
dire
necessity
you
have
a
niece
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
adorable
of
all
nieces
and
the
sight
of
her
charming
face
gladdens
your
heart
but
you
yearn
for
something
more
you
will
not
be
satisfied
until
you
have
seen
your
little
grand
nephews
trotting
around
you
will
see
them
i
earnestly
believe
but
will
you
see
their
children
it
is
doubtful
their
grandchildren
impossible
in
regard
to
the
tenth
twentieth
thirtieth
generation
it
is
useless
even
to
dream
one
dream
of
it
nevertheless
and
perhaps
there
is
no
man
who
has
not
said
to
himself
at
least
once
in
his
life
i
could
but
come
to
life
again
in
a
couple
of
centuries
one
would
wish
to
return
to
earth
to
seek
news
of
his
family
another
of
his
dynasty
a
philosopher
is
anxious
to
know
if
the
ideas
that
he
has
planted
will
have
borne
fruit
a
politician
if
his
party
will
have
obtained
the
upper
hand
a
miser
if
his
heirs
will
not
have
dissipated
the
fortune
he
has
made
a
mere
if
the
trees
in
his
garden
will
have
grown
tall
no
one
is
indifferent
to
the
future
destinies
of
this
world
which
we
gallop
through
in
a
few
years
never
to
return
to
it
again
who
has
not
envied
the
lot
of
epimenides
who
went
to
sleep
in
a
cave
and
on
reopening
his
eyes
perceived
that
the
world
had
grown
old
who
has
not
dreamed
on
his
own
account
of
the
marvellous
adventure
of
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
well
ladies
professor
meiser
one
of
the
least
visionary
men
of
the
age
was
persuaded
that
science
could
put
a
living
being
to
sleep
and
wake
him
up
again
at
the
end
of
an
infinite
number
of
years
arrest
all
the
functions
of
the
system
suspend
life
itself
protect
an
individual
against
the
action
of
time
for
a
century
or
two
and
afterwards
resuscitate
him
he
was
a
fool
then
cried
madame
renault
i
would
swear
it
but
he
had
his
own
ideas
touching
the
which
moves
a
living
organism
do
you
remember
good
mother
mine
the
impression
you
experienced
as
a
little
girl
when
some
one
first
showed
you
the
inside
of
a
watch
in
motion
you
were
satisfied
that
there
was
a
restless
little
animal
inside
the
case
who
worked
hours
a
day
at
turning
the
hands
if
the
hands
stopped
going
you
said
is
because
the
little
animal
is
dead
yet
possibly
he
was
only
asleep
it
has
since
been
explained
to
you
that
a
watch
contains
an
assemblage
of
parts
well
fitted
to
each
other
and
kept
well
oiled
which
being
wound
can
be
considered
to
move
spontaneously
in
a
perfect
correspondence
if
a
spring
become
broken
if
a
bit
of
the
wheel
work
be
injured
or
if
a
grain
of
sand
insinuate
itself
between
two
of
the
parts
the
watch
stops
and
the
children
say
rightly
little
animal
is
dead
but
suppose
a
sound
watch
well
made
right
in
every
particular
and
stopped
because
the
machinery
would
not
run
from
lack
of
oil
the
little
animal
is
not
dead
nothing
but
a
little
oil
is
needed
to
wake
him
up
here
is
a
chronometer
made
in
london
it
runs
fifteen
days
without
being
wound
i
gave
it
a
turn
of
the
key
yesterday
it
has
then
thirteen
days
to
run
if
i
throw
it
on
the
ground
or
if
i
break
the
all
is
over
i
will
have
killed
the
little
animal
but
suppose
that
without
damaging
anything
i
find
means
to
withdraw
or
dry
up
the
fine
oil
which
now
enables
the
parts
to
slip
upon
one
another
will
the
little
animal
be
dead
no
it
will
be
asleep
and
the
proof
is
that
i
can
lay
my
watch
in
a
drawer
keep
it
there
years
and
if
after
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
put
a
drop
of
oil
on
it
the
parts
will
begin
to
move
again
all
that
time
would
have
passed
without
waking
up
the
little
sleeping
animal
it
will
still
have
thirteen
days
to
go
after
the
time
when
it
starts
again
all
living
beings
according
to
the
opinion
of
professor
meiser
are
watches
or
organisms
which
move
breathe
nourish
themselves
and
reproduce
themselves
as
long
as
their
organs
are
intact
and
properly
oiled
the
oil
of
the
watch
is
represented
in
the
animal
by
an
enormous
quantity
of
water
in
man
for
example
water
provides
about
of
the
whole
weight
given
a
colonel
weighing
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
there
are
thirty
pounds
of
colonel
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
or
about
sixty
quarts
of
water
this
is
a
fact
proven
by
numerous
experiments
i
say
a
colonel
just
as
i
would
say
a
king
all
men
are
equal
when
submitted
to
analysis
professor
meiser
was
satisfied
as
are
all
physiologists
that
to
break
a
colonel
head
or
to
make
a
hole
in
his
heart
or
to
cut
his
spinal
column
in
two
is
to
kill
the
little
animal
because
the
brain
the
heart
the
spinal
marrow
are
the
indispensable
springs
without
which
the
machine
can
not
go
but
he
thought
too
that
in
removing
sixty
quarts
of
water
from
a
living
person
one
merely
puts
the
little
animal
to
sleep
without
killing
him
that
a
colonel
carefully
dried
up
can
remain
preserved
a
hundred
years
and
then
return
to
life
whenever
any
one
will
replace
in
him
the
drop
of
oil
or
rather
the
sixty
quarts
of
water
without
which
the
human
machine
can
not
begin
moving
again
this
opinion
which
may
appear
inadmissible
to
you
and
to
me
too
but
which
is
not
absolutely
rejected
by
our
friend
doctor
martout
rests
upon
a
series
of
reliable
observations
which
the
merest
tyro
can
verify
there
animals
which
can
be
resuscitated
nothing
is
more
certain
or
better
proven
herr
meiser
like
the
abbé
spallanzani
and
many
others
collected
from
the
gutter
of
his
roof
some
little
dried
worms
which
were
brittle
as
glass
and
restored
life
to
them
by
soaking
them
in
water
the
capacity
of
thus
returning
to
life
is
not
the
privilege
of
a
single
species
its
existence
has
been
satisfactorily
established
in
numerous
and
various
animals
the
genus
volvox
the
little
worms
or
wormlets
in
vinegar
mud
spoiled
paste
or
the
rotifera
a
kind
of
little
protected
by
a
carapace
provided
with
a
good
digestive
apparatus
of
separate
sexes
having
a
nervous
system
with
a
distinct
brain
having
either
one
or
two
eyes
according
to
the
genus
a
crystalline
lens
and
an
optic
nerve
the
tardigrades
which
are
little
spiders
with
six
or
eight
legs
separate
sexes
regular
digestive
apparatus
a
mouth
two
eyes
a
very
well
defined
nervous
system
and
a
very
well
developed
muscular
system
all
these
die
and
revive
ten
or
fifteen
times
consecutively
at
the
will
of
the
naturalist
one
dries
up
a
rotifer
good
night
to
him
somebody
soaks
him
a
little
and
he
wakes
up
to
bid
you
good
day
all
depends
upon
taking
great
care
while
he
is
dry
you
understand
that
if
any
one
should
merely
break
his
head
no
drop
of
water
nor
river
nor
ocean
could
restore
him
the
marvellous
thing
is
that
an
animal
which
can
not
live
more
than
a
year
like
the
minute
worm
in
can
lie
by
years
without
dying
if
one
has
taken
the
precaution
of
desiccating
him
needham
collected
a
lot
of
them
in
he
presented
them
to
martin
folkes
who
gave
them
to
baker
and
these
interesting
creatures
revived
in
water
in
they
enjoyed
a
rare
satisfaction
in
elbowing
their
own
generation
would
a
man
who
should
see
his
own
generation
be
a
happy
grandfather
another
no
less
interesting
fact
is
that
desiccated
animals
have
vastly
more
tenacity
of
life
than
others
if
the
temperature
were
suddenly
to
fall
thirty
degrees
in
this
laboratory
we
should
all
get
inflammation
of
the
lungs
if
it
were
to
rise
as
much
there
would
be
danger
of
congestion
of
the
brain
well
a
desiccated
animal
which
is
not
absolutely
dead
and
which
will
revive
if
i
soak
it
faces
with
impunity
variations
of
degrees
and
meiser
and
plenty
of
others
have
proved
it
it
remains
to
inquire
then
if
a
superior
animal
a
man
for
instance
can
be
desiccated
without
any
more
disastrous
consequences
than
a
little
worm
or
a
tardigrade
meiser
was
convinced
that
it
is
practicable
he
wrote
to
that
effect
in
all
his
books
although
he
did
not
demonstrate
it
by
experiment
now
where
would
be
the
harm
in
it
ladies
all
men
curious
in
regard
to
the
future
or
dissatisfied
with
life
or
out
of
sorts
with
their
contemporaries
could
hold
themselves
in
reserve
for
a
better
age
and
we
should
have
no
more
suicides
on
account
of
misanthropy
valetudinarians
whom
the
ignorant
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
declares
incurable
need
blow
their
brains
out
any
more
they
can
have
themselves
dried
up
and
wait
peaceably
in
a
box
until
medicine
shall
have
found
a
remedy
for
their
disorders
rejected
lovers
need
no
longer
throw
themselves
into
the
river
they
can
put
themselves
under
the
receiver
of
an
air
pump
and
make
their
appearance
thirty
years
later
young
handsome
and
triumphant
satirizing
the
age
of
their
cruel
charmers
and
paying
them
back
scorn
for
scorn
governments
will
give
up
the
unnatural
and
barbarous
custom
of
guillotining
dangerous
people
they
will
no
longer
shut
them
up
in
cramped
cells
at
mazas
to
complete
their
brutishness
they
will
not
send
them
to
the
toulon
school
to
finish
their
criminal
education
they
will
merely
dry
them
up
in
batches
one
for
ten
years
another
for
forty
according
to
the
gravity
of
their
deserts
a
simple
will
replace
the
prisons
police
and
jails
there
will
be
no
more
escapes
to
fear
no
more
prisoners
to
feed
an
enormous
quantity
of
dried
beans
and
mouldy
potatoes
will
be
saved
for
the
consumption
of
the
country
you
have
ladies
a
feeble
delineation
of
the
benefits
which
doctor
meiser
hoped
to
pour
upon
europe
by
introducing
the
desiccation
of
man
he
made
his
great
experiment
in
on
a
french
colonel
a
prisoner
i
have
been
told
and
condemned
as
a
spy
by
unhappily
he
did
not
succeed
for
i
bought
the
colonel
and
his
box
for
the
price
of
an
ordinary
cavalry
horse
in
the
dirtiest
shop
in
berlin
chapter
iv
the
victim
my
dear
leon
said
renault
you
remind
me
of
a
college
commencement
we
have
listened
to
your
dissertation
just
as
they
listen
to
the
latin
discourse
of
the
professor
of
rhetoric
there
are
always
in
the
audience
a
majority
which
learns
nothing
from
it
and
a
minority
which
understands
nothing
of
it
but
every
body
listens
patiently
on
account
of
the
sensations
which
are
to
come
by
and
by
martout
and
i
are
acquainted
with
meiser
works
and
those
of
his
distinguished
pupil
pouchet
you
have
then
said
too
much
that
is
in
them
if
you
intended
to
speak
for
our
benefit
and
you
have
not
said
enough
that
is
in
them
for
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
know
nothing
of
the
existing
discussions
regarding
the
vital
and
organic
principles
is
life
a
principle
of
action
which
animates
the
organs
and
puts
them
into
play
is
it
not
on
the
contrary
merely
the
result
of
organization
the
play
of
various
functions
of
organized
matter
this
is
a
problem
of
the
highest
importance
which
would
interest
the
ladies
themselves
if
one
were
to
place
it
plainly
before
them
it
would
be
sufficient
to
say
inquire
whether
there
is
a
vital
principle
the
source
of
all
functions
of
the
body
or
if
life
be
not
merely
the
result
of
the
regular
play
of
the
organs
the
vital
principle
in
the
eyes
of
meiser
and
his
disciple
does
not
exist
if
it
really
existed
they
say
one
could
not
understand
how
it
can
leave
a
man
and
a
tardigrade
when
they
are
desiccated
and
return
to
them
again
when
they
are
soaked
now
if
there
be
no
vital
principle
all
the
metaphysical
and
moral
theories
which
have
been
hypothecated
on
its
existence
must
be
reconstructed
these
ladies
have
listened
to
you
patiently
it
is
but
justice
to
them
to
admit
but
all
that
they
have
been
able
to
gather
from
your
slightly
latinish
discourse
is
that
you
have
given
them
a
dissertation
instead
of
the
romance
you
promised
but
we
all
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
the
mummy
you
are
going
to
show
us
open
the
box
we
well
earned
the
sight
cried
clementine
laughing
but
suppose
you
were
to
get
frightened
i
have
you
know
sir
that
i
not
afraid
of
anybody
not
even
of
live
colonels
leon
took
his
bunch
of
keys
and
opened
the
long
oak
box
on
which
he
had
been
seated
the
lid
being
raised
they
saw
a
great
leaden
casket
which
enclosed
a
magnificent
walnut
box
carefully
polished
on
the
outside
and
lined
on
the
inside
with
white
silk
and
padded
the
others
brought
their
lamps
and
candles
near
and
the
colonel
of
the
of
the
line
appeared
as
if
he
were
in
a
chapel
illuminated
for
his
lying
in
state
one
would
have
said
that
the
man
was
asleep
the
perfect
preservation
of
the
body
attested
the
paternal
care
of
the
murderer
it
was
truly
a
remarkable
preparation
and
would
have
borne
comparison
with
the
finest
european
mummies
described
by
vicq
in
and
by
the
younger
puymaurin
in
the
part
best
preserved
as
is
always
the
case
was
the
face
all
the
features
had
maintained
a
proud
and
manly
expression
if
any
old
friend
of
the
colonel
had
been
present
at
the
opening
of
the
third
box
he
would
have
recognized
him
at
first
sight
undoubtedly
the
point
of
the
nose
was
a
little
sharper
the
nostrils
less
expanded
and
thinner
and
the
bridge
a
little
more
marked
than
in
the
year
the
eyelids
were
thinned
the
lips
pinched
the
corners
of
the
mouth
drawn
down
the
cheek
bones
too
prominent
and
the
neck
visibly
shrunken
which
exaggerated
the
prominence
of
the
chin
and
larynx
but
the
eyelids
were
closed
without
contraction
and
the
sockets
much
less
hollow
than
one
could
have
expected
the
mouth
was
not
at
all
distorted
like
the
mouth
of
a
corpse
the
skin
was
slightly
wrinkled
but
had
not
changed
color
it
had
only
become
a
little
more
transparent
showing
after
a
fashion
the
color
of
the
tendons
the
fat
and
the
muscles
wherever
it
rested
directly
upon
them
it
also
had
a
rosy
tint
which
is
not
ordinarily
seen
in
embalmed
corpses
doctor
martout
explained
this
anomaly
by
saying
that
if
the
colonel
had
actually
been
dried
alive
the
globules
of
the
blood
were
not
decomposed
but
simply
collected
in
the
capillary
vessels
of
the
skin
and
subjacent
tissues
where
they
still
preserved
their
proper
color
and
could
be
seen
more
easily
than
otherwise
on
account
of
the
of
the
skin
the
uniform
had
become
much
too
large
as
may
be
readily
understood
though
it
did
not
seem
at
a
casual
glance
that
the
members
had
become
deformed
the
hands
were
dry
and
angular
but
the
nails
although
a
little
bent
inward
toward
the
root
had
preserved
all
their
freshness
the
only
very
noticeable
change
was
the
excessive
depression
of
the
abdominal
walls
which
seemed
crowded
downward
toward
the
posterior
side
at
the
right
a
slight
elevation
indicated
the
place
of
the
liver
a
tap
of
the
finger
on
the
various
parts
of
the
body
produced
a
sound
like
that
from
dry
leather
while
leon
was
pointing
out
these
details
to
his
audience
and
doing
the
honors
of
his
mummy
he
awkwardly
broke
off
the
lower
part
of
the
right
ear
and
a
little
piece
of
the
colonel
remained
in
his
hand
this
trifling
accident
might
have
passed
unnoticed
had
not
clementine
who
followed
with
visible
emotion
all
the
movements
of
her
lover
dropped
her
candle
and
uttered
a
cry
of
affright
all
gathered
around
her
leon
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
a
chair
renault
ran
after
salts
she
was
as
pale
as
death
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
fainting
she
soon
recovered
however
and
reassured
them
all
by
a
charming
smile
pardon
me
she
said
for
such
a
ridiculous
exhibition
of
terror
but
what
monsieur
leon
was
saying
to
us
and
then
that
figure
which
seemed
sleeping
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
poor
man
was
going
to
open
his
mouth
and
cry
out
when
he
was
injured
leon
hastened
to
close
the
walnut
box
while
martout
picked
up
the
piece
of
ear
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
but
clementine
while
continuing
to
smile
and
make
apologies
was
overcome
by
a
fresh
accession
of
emotion
and
melted
into
tears
the
engineer
threw
himself
at
her
feet
poured
forth
excuses
and
tender
phrases
and
did
all
he
could
to
console
her
inexplicable
grief
clementine
dried
her
eyes
looked
prettier
than
ever
and
sighed
fit
to
break
her
heart
without
knowing
why
beast
that
i
am
muttered
leon
tearing
his
hair
on
the
day
when
i
see
her
again
after
three
years
absence
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
than
showing
her
mummies
he
launched
a
kick
at
the
triple
coffin
of
the
colonel
saying
i
wish
the
devil
had
the
confounded
colonel
no
cried
clementine
with
redoubled
energy
and
emotion
do
not
curse
him
monsieur
leon
he
has
suffered
so
much
ah
poor
poor
unfortunate
man
mlle
sambucco
felt
a
little
ashamed
she
made
excuses
for
her
niece
and
declared
that
never
since
her
tenderest
childhood
had
she
manifested
such
extreme
sensitiveness
and
mme
renault
who
had
seen
her
grow
up
doctor
martout
who
had
held
the
sinecure
of
physician
to
her
the
architect
the
notary
in
a
word
everybody
present
was
plunged
into
a
state
of
absolute
stupefaction
clementine
was
no
sensitive
plant
she
was
not
even
a
romantic
school
girl
her
youth
had
not
been
nourished
by
anne
radcliffe
she
did
not
trouble
herself
about
ghosts
and
she
would
go
through
the
house
very
tranquilly
at
ten
at
night
without
a
candle
when
her
mother
died
some
months
before
departure
she
did
not
wish
to
have
any
one
share
with
her
the
sad
satisfaction
of
watching
and
praying
in
the
this
will
teach
us
said
the
aunt
how
to
stay
up
after
ten
what
it
is
midnight
all
to
quarter
of
an
hour
come
my
child
you
will
get
better
fast
enough
after
you
get
to
bed
clementine
arose
submissively
but
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
laboratory
she
retraced
her
steps
and
with
a
caprice
more
inexplicable
than
her
grief
she
absolutely
wished
to
see
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
again
her
aunt
scolded
in
vain
in
spite
of
the
remarks
of
mlle
sambucco
and
all
the
persons
present
she
reopened
the
walnut
box
kneeled
down
beside
the
mummy
and
kissed
it
on
the
forehead
poor
man
said
she
rising
how
cold
he
is
monsieur
leon
promise
me
that
if
he
is
dead
you
will
have
him
laid
in
consecrated
ground
as
you
please
mademoiselle
i
had
intended
to
send
him
to
the
anthropological
museum
with
my
father
permission
but
you
know
that
we
can
refuse
you
nothing
they
did
not
separate
as
gaily
by
a
good
deal
as
they
had
met
renault
and
his
son
escorted
mlle
sambucco
and
her
niece
to
their
door
and
met
the
big
colonel
of
cuirassiers
who
had
been
honoring
clementine
with
his
attentions
the
young
girl
tenderly
pressed
the
arm
of
her
betrothed
and
said
here
is
a
man
who
never
sees
me
without
sighing
and
what
sighs
gracious
heavens
it
would
take
more
than
two
to
fill
the
sails
of
a
a
ship
the
race
of
colonels
has
vastly
degenerated
since
one
does
see
any
more
such
fine
looking
ones
as
our
unfortunate
friend
leon
agreed
with
all
she
said
but
he
did
not
exactly
see
how
he
had
become
the
friend
of
a
mummy
for
which
he
had
just
paid
louis
to
divert
the
conversation
he
said
to
clementine
i
have
not
yet
shown
you
all
the
nice
things
i
brought
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
all
the
russias
made
me
a
present
of
a
little
enamelled
gold
star
hanging
at
the
end
of
a
ribbon
do
you
like
ribbons
oh
yes
answered
she
the
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
did
you
notice
the
poor
colonel
still
has
a
shred
of
one
on
his
uniform
but
the
cross
is
there
no
longer
those
wicked
germans
tore
it
away
from
him
when
they
took
him
prisoner
it
very
possible
said
leon
when
they
reached
mlle
sambucco
house
it
was
time
to
separate
clementine
offered
her
hand
to
leon
who
would
have
been
better
pleased
with
her
cheek
father
and
son
returned
home
arm
in
arm
with
slow
steps
giving
themselves
up
to
endless
conjectures
regarding
the
whimsical
emotions
of
clementine
mme
renault
was
waiting
to
put
her
son
to
bed
a
and
touching
habit
which
mothers
do
not
early
lose
she
showed
him
the
handsome
apartment
above
the
parlor
and
renault
laboratory
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
future
domicile
you
will
be
as
snug
in
here
as
a
little
cock
in
a
pie
said
she
showing
him
a
fairly
marvellous
in
its
comfort
all
the
furniture
is
soft
and
rounded
without
a
single
angle
a
blind
man
could
walk
here
without
any
fear
of
hurting
himself
see
how
i
understand
domestic
comfort
why
each
can
be
a
friend
this
will
cost
you
a
trifle
penon
brothers
came
from
paris
expressly
but
a
man
ought
to
be
comfortable
at
home
so
that
he
may
have
no
temptation
to
go
abroad
this
sweet
motherly
prattle
stretched
itself
over
two
good
hours
and
much
of
it
related
to
clementine
as
you
will
readily
suppose
leon
had
found
her
prettier
than
he
had
dreamed
her
in
his
sweetest
visions
but
less
loving
devil
take
me
said
he
blowing
out
his
candle
one
might
think
that
that
confounded
stuffed
colonel
had
come
to
thrust
himself
between
us
chapter
dreams
of
love
and
other
dreams
leon
learned
to
his
cost
that
a
good
conscience
and
a
good
bed
are
not
enough
to
insure
a
good
sleep
he
was
bedded
like
a
sybarite
innocent
as
an
arcadian
shepherd
and
moreover
tired
as
a
soldier
after
a
forced
march
nevertheless
a
dull
sleeplessness
weighed
upon
him
until
morning
in
vain
he
tossed
into
every
possible
position
as
if
to
shift
the
burden
from
one
shoulder
on
to
the
other
he
did
not
close
his
eyes
until
he
had
seen
the
first
glimmering
of
dawn
silver
the
chinks
of
his
shutters
he
lulled
himself
to
sleep
thinking
of
clementine
an
obliging
dream
soon
showed
him
the
image
of
her
he
loved
he
saw
her
in
bridal
costume
in
the
chapel
of
the
imperial
chateau
she
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
elder
renault
who
had
put
spurs
on
in
honor
of
the
ceremony
leon
followed
having
given
his
arm
to
mlle
sambucco
the
ancient
maiden
was
decorated
with
the
insignia
of
the
legion
of
honor
on
approaching
the
altar
the
bridegroom
noticed
that
his
father
legs
were
as
thin
as
broomsticks
and
when
he
was
about
expressing
his
astonishment
renault
turned
around
and
said
to
him
they
are
thin
because
they
are
desiccated
but
they
are
not
deformed
while
he
was
giving
this
explanation
his
face
altered
his
features
changed
he
shot
out
a
black
moustache
and
grew
terribly
like
the
colonel
the
ceremony
began
the
choir
was
filled
with
tardigrades
and
rotifers
as
large
as
men
and
dressed
like
choristers
they
intoned
in
solemn
measure
a
hymn
of
the
german
composer
meiser
which
began
thus
the
vital
principle
is
a
gratuitous
hypothesis
the
poetry
and
the
music
appeared
admirable
to
leon
he
was
trying
to
impress
them
on
his
memory
when
the
officiating
priest
advanced
toward
him
with
two
gold
rings
on
a
silver
salver
this
priest
was
a
colonel
of
cuirassiers
in
full
uniform
leon
asked
himself
when
and
where
he
had
met
him
it
was
on
the
previous
evening
before
clementine
door
the
cuirassier
murmured
these
words
the
race
of
colonels
has
vastly
degenerated
since
he
heaved
a
profound
sigh
and
the
nave
of
the
chapel
which
was
a
was
driven
over
the
water
at
a
speed
of
forty
knots
leon
tranquilly
took
the
little
gold
ring
and
prepared
to
place
it
on
clementine
finger
but
he
perceived
that
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
was
dried
up
the
nails
alone
had
retained
their
natural
freshness
he
was
frightened
and
fled
across
the
church
which
he
found
filled
with
colonels
of
every
age
and
variety
the
crowd
was
so
dense
that
the
most
efforts
failed
to
penetrate
it
he
escapes
at
last
but
hears
behind
him
the
hurried
steps
of
a
man
who
tries
to
catch
him
he
doubles
his
speed
he
throws
himself
on
he
gallops
he
neighs
the
trees
on
the
way
seem
to
fly
behind
him
he
no
longer
touches
the
earth
but
the
enemy
comes
up
faster
than
the
wind
leon
hears
the
sound
of
his
steps
his
spurs
jingle
he
catches
up
with
leon
seizes
him
by
the
mane
flings
himself
with
a
bound
upon
his
back
and
goads
him
with
the
spur
leon
rears
the
rider
bends
over
toward
his
ear
and
says
stroking
him
with
his
whip
i
am
not
heavy
to
carry
thirty
pounds
of
colonel
the
unhappy
lover
of
mlle
clementine
makes
a
violent
effort
and
springs
sideways
the
colonel
falls
and
draws
his
sword
leon
loses
no
time
he
puts
himself
on
guard
and
fights
but
almost
instantly
feels
the
colonel
sword
enter
his
heart
to
the
hilt
the
chill
of
the
blade
spreads
further
and
further
and
ends
by
freezing
leon
from
head
to
foot
the
colonel
draws
nearer
and
says
smiling
the
is
broken
the
little
animal
is
dead
he
puts
the
body
in
the
walnut
box
which
is
too
short
and
too
narrow
cramped
on
every
side
leon
struggles
strains
and
wakes
himself
up
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
half
smothered
between
the
bed
and
the
wall
he
quickly
jumped
into
his
slippers
and
eagerly
raised
the
windows
and
pushed
open
the
shutters
he
made
light
and
saw
that
it
was
good
as
is
elsewhere
written
brrroum
he
shook
off
the
recollections
of
his
dream
as
a
wet
dog
shakes
off
drops
of
water
the
famous
london
chronometer
told
him
that
it
was
nine
a
cup
of
chocolate
served
by
gothon
helped
not
a
little
to
untangle
his
ideas
on
proceeding
with
his
toilet
in
a
very
bright
cheerful
and
convenient
he
reconciled
himself
to
the
realities
of
life
everything
considered
he
said
to
himself
combing
out
his
yellow
beard
nothing
but
happiness
has
come
to
me
here
i
am
in
my
native
country
with
my
family
and
in
a
pretty
house
which
is
our
own
my
father
and
mother
are
both
well
and
for
myself
i
revel
in
the
most
luxuriant
health
our
fortune
is
moderate
but
so
are
our
tastes
and
we
shall
never
feel
the
want
of
anything
our
friends
received
me
yesterday
with
open
arms
and
as
for
enemies
we
have
none
the
prettiest
girl
in
fontainebleau
is
willing
to
become
my
wife
i
can
marry
her
in
less
than
three
weeks
if
i
see
fit
to
hurry
things
a
little
clementine
did
not
meet
me
as
if
i
were
of
no
interest
to
her
far
from
it
her
lovely
eyes
smiled
upon
me
last
night
with
the
most
tender
regard
it
is
true
that
she
wept
at
the
end
that
too
certain
that
is
my
only
vexation
my
only
anxiety
the
sole
cause
of
that
foolish
dream
i
had
last
night
she
did
weep
but
why
because
i
was
beast
enough
to
regale
her
with
a
lecture
and
that
too
about
a
mummy
all
right
i
have
the
mummy
buried
i
hold
back
my
dissertations
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
will
come
to
disturb
our
happiness
he
went
down
stairs
humming
an
air
from
the
and
mme
renault
who
were
not
accustomed
to
going
to
bed
after
midnight
were
still
asleep
on
going
into
the
laboratory
he
saw
that
the
triple
box
of
the
colonel
was
closed
gothon
had
placed
a
little
wooden
cross
and
a
sprig
of
consecrated
box
on
the
cover
we
may
as
well
begin
masses
for
his
soul
he
murmured
between
his
teeth
with
a
smile
that
might
have
been
a
little
sceptical
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
clementine
in
her
agitation
had
forgotten
the
presents
he
had
brought
her
he
made
a
bundle
of
them
looked
at
his
watch
and
concluded
that
there
would
be
no
indiscretion
in
straining
a
point
to
go
to
mlle
sambucco
the
aunt
was
an
early
riser
as
they
generally
are
in
the
rural
districts
and
had
in
fact
already
gone
out
to
church
and
clementine
was
gardening
near
the
house
she
ran
to
her
lover
without
thinking
of
throwing
down
the
little
rake
she
held
in
her
hand
and
with
the
sweetest
smile
in
the
world
held
up
her
pretty
rosy
cheeks
which
were
a
little
moist
and
flushed
by
the
pleasant
warmth
of
pleasure
and
exercise
are
you
put
out
with
me
said
she
i
was
very
ridiculous
last
night
my
aunt
has
scolded
me
in
the
bargain
and
i
forgot
to
take
the
pretty
things
you
brought
me
from
among
the
savages
but
it
was
not
from
lack
of
appreciation
i
am
so
happy
to
see
that
you
have
always
thought
of
me
as
i
have
thought
of
you
i
could
have
sent
for
them
but
i
am
pleasantly
anticipated
my
heart
told
me
that
you
would
come
yourself
your
heart
knew
me
dear
clementine
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
it
did
not
know
its
owner
how
good
you
are
and
how
much
i
love
you
oh
i
too
dear
leon
i
love
you
dearly
she
stood
the
rake
against
a
tree
and
hung
upon
the
arm
of
her
intended
husband
with
that
supple
and
languishing
grace
the
secret
of
which
the
creoles
possess
come
this
way
said
she
so
that
i
can
show
you
all
the
improvements
we
have
made
in
the
garden
leon
admired
everything
she
wanted
him
to
the
fact
is
that
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
her
the
grotto
of
polyphemus
and
the
cave
of
cæcus
would
have
appeared
to
him
pleasanter
than
the
gardens
of
armida
if
clementine
little
red
jacket
had
been
promenading
in
them
he
asked
her
if
she
did
not
feel
some
regret
in
leaving
so
charming
a
retreat
and
one
which
she
had
embellished
with
so
much
care
why
asked
she
without
thinking
to
blush
we
will
not
go
far
off
and
besides
wo
we
come
here
every
day
the
coming
marriage
was
a
thing
so
well
settled
that
it
had
not
even
been
spoken
of
on
the
previous
evening
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
publish
the
bans
and
fix
the
date
clementine
simple
and
honest
heart
expressed
herself
without
any
false
modesty
concerning
an
event
so
entirely
expected
so
natural
and
so
agreeable
she
had
expressed
her
tastes
to
mme
renault
in
the
arrangement
of
the
new
apartments
and
chosen
the
hangings
herself
and
she
no
longer
made
any
ceremony
in
talking
with
her
intended
of
the
happy
life
in
common
which
was
about
beginning
for
them
of
the
people
they
would
invite
to
the
marriage
ceremony
of
the
wedding
calls
to
be
made
afterwards
of
the
day
which
should
be
appropriated
for
receptions
and
of
the
time
they
would
devote
to
each
other
society
and
to
work
she
inquired
in
regard
to
the
occupation
which
leon
intended
to
make
for
himself
and
the
hours
which
of
preference
he
would
give
to
study
this
excellent
little
woman
would
have
been
ashamed
to
bear
the
name
of
a
sloth
and
unhappy
in
passing
her
days
with
an
idler
she
promised
leon
in
advance
to
respect
his
work
as
a
sacred
thing
on
her
part
she
thoroughly
intended
to
make
her
time
also
of
use
and
not
to
live
with
folded
arms
at
the
start
she
would
take
charge
of
the
housekeeping
under
the
direction
of
madame
renault
who
was
beginning
to
find
it
a
little
burdensome
and
then
would
she
not
soon
have
children
to
care
for
bring
up
and
educate
this
was
a
noble
and
useful
pleasure
which
she
did
not
intend
to
share
with
any
one
nevertheless
she
would
send
her
sons
to
college
in
order
to
fit
them
for
living
in
the
world
and
to
teach
them
early
those
principles
of
justice
and
equality
which
are
the
foundation
of
every
good
manly
character
leon
let
her
talk
on
only
interrupting
her
to
agree
with
her
for
these
two
young
people
who
had
been
educated
and
brought
up
with
the
same
ideas
saw
everything
with
the
same
eyes
education
had
created
this
pleasant
harmony
rather
than
love
do
you
know
said
clementine
that
i
felt
an
awful
palpitation
of
the
heart
when
i
entered
the
room
where
you
were
yesterday
if
you
think
that
my
heart
beat
less
violently
than
yours
oh
but
it
was
a
different
thing
with
me
i
was
afraid
what
of
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
not
find
you
the
same
as
i
had
seen
you
in
my
thoughts
remember
that
it
had
been
three
years
since
we
bid
each
other
good
bye
i
remembered
distinctly
what
you
were
when
you
went
away
and
with
imagination
helping
memory
a
little
i
had
reconstructed
my
leon
entire
but
if
you
had
no
longer
resembled
him
what
would
have
become
of
me
in
the
presence
of
a
new
leon
when
i
had
formed
the
pleasant
habit
of
loving
the
other
you
make
me
tremble
but
your
first
greeting
reassured
me
in
advance
tut
sir
do
speak
of
that
first
greeting
or
you
will
make
me
blush
a
second
time
let
us
speak
rather
of
that
poor
colonel
who
made
me
shed
so
many
tears
how
is
he
getting
along
this
morning
i
forgot
to
inquire
after
his
health
but
if
you
want
me
to
it
useless
you
can
announce
to
him
a
visit
from
me
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
him
this
noon
you
would
be
very
sensible
to
give
up
this
fancy
why
expose
yourself
again
to
such
painful
emotions
the
fancy
is
stronger
than
i
am
seriously
dear
leon
the
old
fellow
attracts
me
why
fellow
he
has
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
died
when
from
to
thirty
years
of
age
are
you
very
sure
that
he
is
dead
i
said
fellow
because
of
a
dream
i
had
last
night
ha
you
too
yes
you
remember
how
agitated
i
was
on
leaving
you
and
moreover
i
had
been
scolded
by
my
aunt
and
too
i
had
been
thinking
of
terrible
sights
my
poor
mother
lying
on
her
in
fact
my
spirits
were
quite
broken
down
poor
dear
little
heart
nevertheless
as
i
did
not
want
to
think
about
anything
any
more
i
went
to
bed
quickly
and
shut
my
eyes
with
all
my
might
so
tightly
indeed
that
i
put
myself
to
sleep
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
the
colonel
he
was
lying
as
i
saw
him
in
his
triple
coffin
but
he
had
long
white
hair
and
a
most
benign
and
venerable
appearance
he
begged
us
to
put
him
in
consecrated
ground
and
we
carried
him
you
and
i
to
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
on
reaching
my
mother
tomb
we
saw
that
the
stone
was
displaced
my
mother
in
a
white
robe
was
moved
so
as
to
make
a
place
beside
her
and
she
seemed
waiting
for
the
colonel
but
every
time
we
attempted
to
lay
him
down
the
coffin
left
our
hands
and
rested
suspended
in
the
air
as
if
it
had
no
weight
i
could
distinguish
the
poor
old
man
features
for
his
triple
coffin
had
become
as
transparent
as
the
alabaster
lamp
burning
near
the
ceiling
of
my
chamber
he
was
sad
and
his
broken
ear
bled
freely
all
at
once
he
escaped
from
our
hands
the
coffin
vanished
and
i
saw
nothing
but
him
pale
as
a
statue
and
tall
as
the
tallest
oaks
of
the
his
golden
epaulettes
spread
out
and
became
wings
and
he
raised
himself
to
heaven
holding
over
us
both
hands
as
if
in
blessing
i
woke
up
all
in
tears
but
i
have
not
told
my
dream
to
my
aunt
for
she
would
have
scolded
me
again
no
one
ought
to
be
scolded
but
me
clementine
dear
it
is
my
fault
that
your
gentle
slumbers
are
troubled
by
visions
of
the
other
world
but
all
this
will
be
stopped
soon
i
am
going
to
seek
a
definite
receptacle
for
the
colonel
chapter
vi
a
young
girl
caprice
clementine
had
a
fresh
young
heart
before
knowing
leon
she
had
loved
but
one
person
her
mother
no
cousins
of
either
sex
nor
uncles
nor
aunts
nor
grandfathers
nor
grandmothers
had
dissipated
by
dividing
it
among
themselves
that
little
treasure
of
affection
which
children
bring
into
the
world
the
grandmother
clementine
pichon
was
married
at
nancy
in
january
and
died
three
months
later
in
the
suburbs
of
toulon
during
her
first
confinement
the
grandfather
langevin
a
of
the
first
class
being
left
a
widower
with
a
daughter
in
the
cradle
devoted
himself
to
bringing
up
his
child
he
gave
her
in
to
sambucco
an
estimable
and
agreeable
man
of
italian
extraction
born
in
france
and
king
counsel
in
the
court
of
marseilles
in
sambucco
who
was
a
man
of
considerable
independence
because
he
had
resources
of
his
own
in
some
manner
highly
honorable
to
himself
incurred
the
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
he
was
therefore
appointed
to
martinique
and
after
some
days
of
hesitation
accepted
the
transfer
to
that
remote
situation
but
old
langevin
did
not
easily
console
himself
for
the
departure
of
his
daughter
he
died
two
years
later
without
having
embraced
the
little
clementine
to
whom
it
was
intended
that
he
should
be
godfather
sambucco
his
lost
his
life
in
during
an
earthquake
the
papers
of
the
colony
and
of
the
metropolis
related
at
the
time
how
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
devotion
to
others
after
this
fearful
misfortune
the
young
widow
hastened
to
recross
the
sea
with
her
daughter
she
settled
in
fontainebleau
in
order
that
the
child
might
live
in
a
healthy
atmosphere
fontainebleau
is
one
of
the
healthiest
places
in
france
if
mme
sambucco
had
been
as
good
a
manager
as
she
was
mother
she
would
have
left
clementine
a
respectable
fortune
but
she
regulated
her
affairs
badly
and
got
herself
under
heavy
embarrassments
a
neighboring
notary
relieved
her
of
a
round
sum
and
two
farms
which
she
had
paid
dearly
for
brought
her
almost
nothing
in
short
she
no
longer
knew
what
her
situation
was
and
began
to
lose
all
control
of
it
when
a
sister
of
her
husband
an
old
maid
pinched
and
pious
expressed
a
desire
to
live
with
her
and
use
their
resources
in
common
the
arrival
of
this
spinster
strangely
frightened
the
little
clementine
who
hid
herself
under
the
furniture
and
nestled
among
her
mother
skirts
but
it
was
the
salvation
of
the
house
mlle
sambucco
was
not
one
of
the
most
spirituelle
nor
one
of
the
most
romantic
of
women
but
she
was
order
incarnated
she
reduced
the
expenses
handled
the
resources
herself
sold
the
two
farms
in
bought
some
in
and
restored
stable
equilibrium
in
the
budget
thanks
to
the
talents
and
activity
of
this
female
steward
the
gentle
and
improvident
widow
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
fondle
her
child
clementine
learned
to
honor
the
virtues
of
her
aunt
but
she
adored
her
mother
when
she
had
the
affliction
of
losing
her
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
leaning
on
mlle
sambucco
like
a
young
plant
on
a
prop
of
dry
wood
it
was
then
that
her
friendship
for
leon
glimmered
with
a
vague
ray
of
love
and
young
renault
profited
by
the
necessity
for
expansion
which
filled
this
youthful
soul
during
the
three
long
years
that
leon
spent
away
from
her
clementine
scarcely
knew
that
she
was
alone
she
loved
and
felt
that
she
was
loved
in
return
she
had
faith
in
the
future
and
an
inner
life
of
tenderness
and
timid
hope
and
this
noble
and
gentle
heart
required
nothing
more
but
what
completely
astonished
her
betrothed
her
aunt
and
herself
and
strangely
subverted
all
the
best
accredited
theories
respecting
the
feminine
heart
what
indeed
reason
would
have
refused
to
credit
had
it
not
been
established
by
facts
was
that
the
day
when
she
again
met
the
husband
of
her
choice
an
hour
after
she
had
thrown
herself
into
leon
arms
with
a
grace
so
full
of
trust
clementine
was
so
abruptly
invaded
by
a
new
sentiment
which
was
not
love
nor
friendship
nor
fear
but
transcended
them
all
and
spoke
with
master
tones
in
her
heart
from
the
instant
when
leon
had
shown
her
the
figure
of
the
colonel
she
had
been
seized
by
an
actual
passion
for
this
nameless
mummy
it
was
nothing
like
what
she
felt
towards
young
renault
but
it
was
a
combination
of
interest
compassion
and
respectful
sympathy
if
any
one
had
recounted
some
famous
feat
of
arms
or
some
romantic
history
of
which
the
colonel
had
been
the
hero
this
impression
would
have
been
natural
or
at
least
explicable
but
she
knew
nothing
of
him
except
that
he
had
been
condemned
as
a
spy
by
a
council
of
war
and
yet
she
dreamed
of
him
the
very
night
after
leon
return
this
inexplicable
prepossession
at
first
manifested
itself
in
a
religious
form
she
caused
a
mass
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
the
colonel
soul
and
urged
leon
to
make
preparations
for
the
funeral
herself
selecting
the
ground
in
which
he
was
to
be
interred
these
various
cares
never
caused
her
to
omit
her
daily
visit
to
the
walnut
box
or
the
respectful
bending
of
the
knee
before
the
body
or
the
sisterly
or
filial
kiss
which
she
regularly
placed
upon
its
forehead
the
renault
family
soon
became
uneasy
about
such
strange
symptoms
and
hastened
the
interment
of
the
attractive
unknown
in
order
to
relieve
themselves
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
but
the
day
before
the
one
fixed
for
the
ceremony
clementine
changed
her
mind
by
what
right
could
they
shut
in
the
tomb
a
man
who
possibly
was
not
dead
the
theories
of
the
learned
doctor
meiser
were
not
such
that
one
could
reject
them
without
examination
the
matter
was
at
least
worthy
of
a
few
days
reflection
was
it
not
possible
to
submit
the
colonel
body
to
some
experiments
professor
hirtz
of
berlin
had
promised
to
send
some
valuable
documents
concerning
the
life
and
death
of
this
unfortunate
officer
nothing
ought
to
be
undertaken
before
they
were
received
some
one
ought
to
write
to
berlin
to
hasten
the
sending
of
these
papers
leon
sighed
but
yielded
uncomplainingly
to
this
new
caprice
and
wrote
to
hirtz
clementine
found
an
ally
in
this
second
campaign
in
doctor
martout
though
he
was
but
an
average
practitioner
and
disdained
the
acquisition
of
practice
far
too
much
martout
was
not
deficient
in
knowledge
he
had
long
been
studying
five
or
six
great
questions
in
physiology
such
as
reanimation
spontaneous
generation
and
the
topics
connected
with
them
a
regular
correspondence
kept
him
posted
in
all
recent
discoveries
he
was
the
friend
of
pouchet
of
rouen
and
knew
also
the
celebrated
karl
nibor
who
has
carried
the
use
of
the
microscope
into
researches
so
wide
and
so
profound
martout
had
desiccated
and
resuscitated
thousands
of
little
worms
rotifers
and
tardigrades
he
held
that
life
is
nothing
but
organization
in
action
and
that
the
idea
of
reviving
a
desiccated
man
has
nothing
absurd
about
it
he
gave
himself
up
to
long
meditations
when
professor
hirtz
sent
from
berlin
the
following
document
the
original
of
which
is
filed
among
the
manuscripts
of
the
humboldt
collection
chapter
vii
professor
meiser
will
in
favor
of
the
desiccated
colonel
on
this
day
of
january
being
worn
down
by
a
cruel
malady
and
feeling
the
approach
of
the
time
when
my
person
shall
be
absorbed
in
the
great
all
i
have
written
with
my
own
hand
this
testament
which
is
the
expression
of
my
last
will
i
appoint
as
executor
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
a
wealthy
brewer
in
the
city
of
dantzic
i
bequeath
my
books
papers
and
scientific
collections
of
all
kinds
except
item
to
my
very
estimable
and
learned
friend
herr
von
humboldt
i
bequeath
all
the
rest
of
my
effects
real
and
personal
valued
at
prussian
thalers
or
francs
to
colonel
pierre
victor
fougas
at
present
desiccated
but
living
and
entered
in
my
catalogue
opposite
no
zoology
i
trust
that
he
will
accept
this
feeble
compensation
for
the
ordeals
he
has
undergone
in
my
laboratory
and
the
service
he
has
rendered
to
science
finally
in
order
that
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
may
exactly
understand
the
duties
i
leave
him
to
perform
i
have
resolved
to
inscribe
here
a
detailed
account
of
the
desiccation
of
colonel
fougas
my
sole
heir
it
was
on
the
of
november
in
that
unhappy
year
that
my
relations
with
this
brave
young
man
began
i
had
long
since
quitted
dantzic
where
the
noise
of
cannon
and
the
danger
from
bombs
had
rendered
all
labor
impossible
and
retired
with
my
instruments
and
books
under
the
protection
of
the
allied
armies
in
the
fortified
town
of
liebenfeld
the
french
garrisons
of
dantzic
stettin
custrin
glogau
hamburg
and
several
other
german
towns
could
not
communicate
with
each
other
or
with
their
native
land
meanwhile
general
rapp
was
obstinately
defending
himself
against
the
english
fleet
and
the
russian
army
colonel
fougas
was
taken
by
a
detachment
of
the
barclay
de
tolly
corps
as
he
was
trying
to
pass
the
vistula
on
the
ice
on
the
way
to
dantzic
they
brought
him
prisoner
to
liebenfeld
on
the
of
november
just
at
my
supper
time
and
sergeant
garok
who
commanded
in
the
village
forced
me
to
be
present
at
the
examination
and
act
as
interpreter
the
open
countenance
manly
voice
proud
firmness
and
fine
carriage
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
won
my
heart
he
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
his
only
regret
he
said
was
having
stranded
so
near
port
after
passing
through
four
armies
and
being
unable
to
carry
out
the
orders
he
appeared
animated
by
that
french
fanaticism
which
has
done
so
much
harm
to
our
beloved
germany
nevertheless
i
could
not
help
defending
him
and
i
translated
his
words
less
as
an
interpreter
than
as
an
advocate
unhappily
they
found
upon
him
a
letter
from
napoleon
to
general
rapp
of
which
i
preserved
a
copy
abandon
dantzic
break
the
blockade
unite
with
the
garrisons
of
stettin
custrin
and
glogau
march
along
the
elbe
arrange
with
cyr
and
davoust
to
concentrate
the
forces
scattered
at
dresden
forgau
wittenberg
magdeburg
and
hamburg
roll
up
an
army
like
a
snow
ball
cross
westphalia
which
is
open
and
come
to
defend
the
line
of
the
rhine
with
an
army
of
frenchmen
which
you
will
have
saved
napoleon
this
letter
was
sent
to
the
headquarters
of
the
russian
army
whilst
a
illiterate
soldiers
drunk
with
joy
and
bad
brandy
condemned
the
brave
colonel
of
the
of
the
line
to
the
death
of
a
spy
and
a
traitor
the
execution
was
fixed
for
the
next
day
the
and
pierre
victor
fougas
after
having
thanked
and
embraced
me
with
the
most
touching
sensibility
he
is
a
husband
and
a
father
was
shut
up
in
the
little
battlemented
tower
of
liebenfeld
where
the
wind
whistles
terribly
through
all
the
loopholes
the
night
of
the
and
of
november
was
one
of
the
severest
of
that
terrible
winter
my
thermometer
which
hung
outside
my
window
with
a
southeast
exposure
marked
nineteen
degrees
below
zero
centigrade
i
went
early
in
the
morning
to
bid
the
colonel
a
last
farewell
and
met
sergeant
garok
who
said
to
me
in
bad
german
we
wo
have
to
kill
the
frantzouski
he
is
frozen
to
death
i
ran
to
the
prison
the
colonel
was
lying
on
his
back
rigid
but
i
found
after
a
few
minutes
examination
that
the
rigidity
of
the
body
was
not
that
of
death
the
joints
though
they
had
not
their
ordinary
suppleness
could
be
bent
and
extended
without
any
great
effort
the
limbs
the
face
and
the
chest
gave
my
hands
a
sensation
of
cold
but
very
different
from
that
which
i
had
often
experienced
from
contact
with
corpses
knowing
that
he
had
passed
several
nights
without
sleep
and
endured
extraordinary
fatigues
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
fallen
into
that
profound
and
lethargic
sleep
which
is
superinduced
by
intense
cold
and
which
if
too
far
prolonged
slackens
respiration
and
circulation
to
a
point
where
the
most
delicate
physiological
tests
are
necessary
to
discover
the
continuance
of
life
the
pulse
was
insensible
at
least
my
fingers
benumbed
with
cold
could
not
feel
it
my
hardness
of
hearing
i
was
then
in
my
year
prevented
my
determining
by
auscultation
whether
the
beats
of
the
heart
still
aroused
those
feeble
though
prolonged
vibrations
which
the
ear
continues
to
hear
some
time
after
the
hand
fails
to
detect
them
the
colonel
had
reached
that
point
of
torpor
produced
by
cold
where
to
revive
a
man
without
causing
him
to
die
requires
numerous
and
delicate
attentions
some
hours
after
congelation
would
supervene
and
with
it
impossibility
of
restoration
to
life
i
was
in
the
greatest
perplexity
on
the
one
hand
i
knew
that
he
was
dying
on
my
hands
by
congelation
on
the
other
i
could
not
by
myself
bestow
upon
him
the
attentions
that
were
indispensable
if
i
were
to
administer
stimulants
without
having
him
at
the
same
time
rubbed
on
the
trunk
and
limbs
by
three
or
four
vigorous
assistants
i
would
revive
him
only
to
see
him
die
i
had
still
before
my
eyes
the
spectacle
of
that
lovely
young
girl
asphyxiated
in
a
fire
whom
i
succeeded
in
reviving
by
placing
burning
coals
under
the
clavicles
but
who
could
only
call
her
mother
and
died
almost
immediately
in
spite
of
the
administration
of
internal
stimulants
and
electricity
for
inducing
contractions
of
the
diaphragm
and
heart
and
even
if
i
should
succeed
in
bringing
him
back
to
health
and
strength
was
not
he
condemned
by
did
not
humanity
forbid
my
rousing
him
from
this
repose
akin
to
death
to
deliver
him
to
the
horrors
of
execution
i
must
confess
that
in
the
presence
of
this
organism
where
life
was
suspended
my
ideas
on
reanimation
took
as
it
were
fresh
hold
upon
me
i
had
so
often
desiccated
and
revived
beings
quite
elevated
in
the
animal
scale
that
i
did
not
doubt
the
success
of
the
operation
even
on
a
man
by
myself
alone
i
could
not
revive
and
save
the
colonel
but
i
had
in
my
laboratory
all
the
instruments
necessary
to
desiccate
him
without
assistance
to
sum
up
three
alternatives
offered
themselves
to
me
i
to
leave
the
colonel
in
the
crenellated
tower
where
he
would
have
died
the
same
day
of
congelation
ii
to
revive
him
by
stimulants
at
the
risk
of
killing
him
and
for
what
to
give
him
up
in
case
of
success
to
inevitable
execution
iii
to
desiccate
him
in
my
laboratory
with
the
quasi
certainty
of
resuscitating
him
after
the
restoration
of
peace
all
friends
of
humanity
will
doubtless
comprehend
that
i
could
not
hesitate
long
i
had
sergeant
garok
called
and
i
begged
him
to
sell
me
the
body
of
the
colonel
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
i
had
bought
a
corpse
for
dissection
so
my
request
excited
no
suspicion
the
bargain
concluded
i
gave
him
four
bottles
of
and
soon
two
russian
soldiers
brought
me
colonel
fougas
on
a
stretcher
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
with
him
i
pricked
one
of
his
fingers
pressure
forced
out
a
drop
of
blood
to
place
it
under
a
microscope
between
two
plates
of
glass
was
the
work
of
a
minute
oh
joy
the
fibrin
was
not
coagulated
the
red
globules
appeared
cleanly
circular
flattened
biconcave
and
without
notches
indentations
or
spheroidal
swellings
the
white
globules
changed
their
shape
taking
at
intervals
the
spherical
form
and
varying
their
shapes
again
by
delicate
expansions
i
was
not
deceived
then
it
was
a
torpid
man
that
i
had
under
my
eyes
and
not
a
dead
one
i
placed
him
on
a
pair
of
scales
he
weighed
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
clothing
included
i
did
not
care
to
undress
him
for
i
had
noticed
that
animals
desiccated
directly
in
contact
with
the
air
died
oftener
than
those
which
remained
covered
with
moss
and
other
soft
materials
during
the
ordeal
of
desiccation
my
great
with
its
immense
platform
its
enormous
oval
receiver
which
a
rope
running
on
a
pulley
firmly
fixed
in
the
ceiling
easily
raised
and
lowered
by
means
of
a
windlass
all
these
thousand
and
one
contrivances
which
i
had
so
laboriously
prepared
in
spite
of
the
railleries
of
those
who
envied
me
and
which
i
felt
desolate
at
seeing
unemployed
were
going
to
find
their
use
unexpected
circumstances
had
arisen
at
last
to
procure
me
such
a
subject
for
experiment
as
i
had
in
vain
endeavored
to
procure
while
i
was
attempting
to
reduce
to
torpidity
dogs
rabbits
sheep
and
other
mammals
by
the
aid
of
freezing
mixtures
long
ago
without
doubt
would
these
results
have
been
attained
if
i
had
been
aided
by
those
who
surrounded
me
instead
of
being
made
the
butt
of
their
railleries
if
our
authorities
had
sustained
me
with
their
influence
instead
of
treating
me
as
a
subversive
spirit
i
shut
myself
up
with
the
colonel
and
took
care
that
even
old
getchen
my
housekeeper
now
deceased
should
not
trouble
me
during
my
work
i
had
substituted
for
the
wearisome
lever
of
the
old
fashioned
a
wheel
arranged
with
an
eccentric
which
transformed
the
circular
movement
of
the
axis
into
the
rectilinear
movement
required
by
the
pistons
the
wheel
the
eccentric
the
connecting
rod
and
the
joints
of
the
apparatus
all
worked
admirably
and
enabled
me
to
do
everything
by
myself
the
cold
did
not
impede
the
play
of
the
machine
and
the
lubricating
oil
was
not
gummed
i
had
refined
it
myself
by
a
new
process
founded
on
the
then
recent
discoveries
of
the
french
chevreul
having
extended
the
body
on
the
platform
of
the
lowered
the
receiver
and
luted
the
rim
i
undertook
to
submit
it
gradually
to
the
influence
of
a
dry
vacuum
and
cold
capsules
filled
with
chloride
of
calcium
were
placed
around
the
colonel
to
absorb
the
water
which
should
evaporate
from
the
body
and
to
promote
the
desiccation
i
certainly
found
myself
in
the
best
possible
situation
for
subjecting
the
human
body
to
a
process
of
gradual
desiccation
without
sudden
interruption
of
the
functions
or
disorganization
of
the
tissues
or
fluids
seldom
had
my
experiments
on
rotifers
and
tardigrades
been
surrounded
with
equal
chances
of
success
yet
they
had
always
succeeded
but
the
particular
nature
of
the
subject
and
the
special
scruples
imposed
upon
my
conscience
obliged
me
to
employ
a
certain
number
of
new
conditions
which
i
had
long
since
in
other
connections
foreseen
the
expediency
of
i
had
taken
the
pains
to
arrange
an
opening
at
each
end
of
my
oval
receiver
and
fit
into
it
a
heavy
glass
which
enabled
me
to
follow
with
my
eye
the
effects
of
the
vacuum
on
the
colonel
i
was
entirely
prevented
from
shutting
the
windows
of
my
laboratory
from
fear
that
a
too
elevated
temperature
might
put
an
end
to
the
lethargy
of
the
subject
or
induce
some
change
in
the
fluids
if
a
thaw
had
come
on
all
would
have
been
over
with
my
experiment
but
the
thermometer
kept
for
several
days
between
six
and
eight
degrees
below
zero
and
i
was
very
happy
in
seeing
the
lethargic
sleep
continue
without
having
to
fear
congelation
of
the
tissues
i
commenced
to
produce
the
vacuum
with
extreme
slowness
for
fear
that
the
gases
distributed
through
the
blood
becoming
free
on
account
of
the
difference
of
their
tension
from
that
of
rarified
air
might
escape
in
the
vessels
and
so
bring
on
immediate
death
moreover
i
watched
every
moment
the
effects
of
the
vacuum
on
the
intestinal
gases
for
by
expanding
inside
in
proportion
as
the
pressure
of
the
air
diminished
outside
of
the
body
they
could
have
caused
serious
disorders
the
tissues
might
not
have
been
entirely
ruptured
by
them
but
an
internal
lesion
would
have
been
enough
to
occasion
death
in
a
few
hours
after
reanimation
one
observes
this
quite
frequently
in
animals
carelessly
desiccated
several
times
too
rapid
a
protrusion
of
the
abdomen
put
me
on
my
guard
against
the
danger
which
i
feared
and
i
was
obliged
to
let
in
a
little
air
under
the
receiver
at
last
the
cessation
of
all
phenomena
of
this
kind
satisfied
me
that
the
gases
had
disappeared
by
exosmose
or
had
been
expelled
by
the
spontaneous
contraction
of
the
viscera
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
first
day
that
i
could
give
up
these
minute
precautions
and
carry
the
vacuum
a
little
further
the
next
day
the
i
pushed
the
vacuum
to
a
point
where
the
barometer
fell
to
five
millimetres
as
no
change
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
the
body
or
limbs
i
was
sure
that
no
convulsion
had
been
produced
the
colonel
had
been
desiccated
had
become
immobile
had
lost
the
power
of
performing
the
functions
of
life
without
death
having
supervened
and
without
the
possibility
of
returning
to
activity
having
departed
his
life
was
suspended
not
extinguished
each
time
that
a
surplus
of
watery
vapor
caused
the
barometer
to
ascend
i
pumped
on
the
the
door
of
my
laboratory
was
literally
broken
in
by
the
russian
general
count
trollohub
who
had
been
sent
from
headquarters
this
distinguished
officer
had
run
in
all
haste
to
prevent
the
execution
of
the
colonel
and
to
conduct
him
into
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
i
loyally
confessed
to
him
what
i
had
done
under
the
inspiration
of
my
conscience
i
showed
him
the
body
through
one
of
the
of
the
i
told
him
that
i
was
happy
to
have
preserved
a
man
who
could
furnish
useful
information
to
the
liberators
of
my
country
and
i
offered
to
resuscitate
him
at
my
own
expense
if
they
would
promise
me
to
respect
his
life
and
liberty
the
general
count
trollohub
unquestionably
a
distinguished
man
but
one
of
an
exclusively
military
education
thought
that
i
was
not
speaking
seriously
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
in
my
face
and
treating
me
like
an
old
fool
i
set
myself
to
pumping
again
and
kept
the
vacuum
at
a
pressure
of
from
three
to
five
millimetres
for
the
space
of
three
months
i
knew
by
experience
that
animals
can
revive
after
being
submitted
to
a
dry
vacuum
and
cold
for
eighty
days
on
the
of
february
having
observed
that
for
a
month
no
modification
had
taken
place
in
the
shrinking
of
the
flesh
i
resolved
to
submit
the
colonel
to
another
series
of
operations
in
order
to
insure
more
perfect
preservation
by
complete
desiccation
i
let
the
air
by
the
arranged
for
the
purpose
and
after
raising
the
receiver
proceeded
at
once
to
my
experiment
the
body
did
not
weigh
more
than
pounds
i
had
then
reduced
it
nearly
to
a
third
of
its
original
weight
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
clothing
had
not
lost
as
much
water
as
the
other
parts
now
the
human
body
contains
nearly
of
its
own
weight
of
water
as
is
proved
by
a
desiccation
thoroughly
made
in
a
chemical
drying
furnace
i
accordingly
placed
the
colonel
on
a
tray
and
after
sliding
it
into
my
great
furnace
gradually
raised
the
temperature
to
degrees
centigrade
i
did
not
dare
to
go
beyond
this
heat
from
fear
of
altering
the
albumen
and
rendering
it
insoluble
and
also
of
taking
away
from
the
tissues
the
capacity
of
reabsorbing
the
water
necessary
to
a
return
to
their
functions
i
had
taken
care
to
arrange
a
convenient
apparatus
so
that
the
furnace
was
constantly
traversed
by
a
current
of
dry
air
this
air
was
dried
in
traversing
a
series
of
jars
filled
with
sulphuric
acid
and
chloride
of
calcium
after
a
week
passed
in
the
furnace
the
general
appearance
of
the
body
had
not
changed
but
its
weight
was
reduced
to
forty
pounds
clothing
included
eight
days
more
brought
no
new
decrease
of
weight
from
this
i
concluded
that
the
desiccation
was
sufficient
i
knew
very
well
that
corpses
mummified
in
church
vaults
for
a
century
or
more
end
by
weighing
no
more
than
a
of
pounds
but
they
do
not
become
so
light
without
a
material
alteration
in
their
tissues
on
the
of
february
i
myself
placed
the
colonel
in
the
boxes
which
i
had
had
made
for
his
occupancy
since
that
time
that
is
to
say
during
a
space
of
nine
years
and
eleven
months
we
have
never
been
separated
i
carried
him
with
me
to
dantzic
he
stays
in
my
house
i
have
never
placed
him
according
to
his
number
in
my
zoological
collection
he
remains
by
himself
in
the
chamber
of
honor
i
do
not
grant
any
one
the
pleasure
of
his
chloride
of
calcium
i
will
take
care
of
you
till
my
dying
day
oh
colonel
fougas
dear
and
unfortunate
friend
but
i
shall
not
have
the
joy
of
witnessing
your
resurrection
i
shall
not
share
the
delightful
emotions
of
the
warrior
returning
to
life
your
lachrymal
glands
inert
but
some
day
to
be
reanimated
will
not
pour
upon
the
bosom
of
your
old
benefactor
the
sweet
dew
of
recognition
for
you
will
not
recover
your
life
until
a
day
when
mine
will
have
long
since
departed
perhaps
you
will
be
astonished
that
i
loving
you
as
i
do
should
have
so
long
delayed
to
draw
you
out
of
this
profound
slumber
who
knows
but
that
some
bitter
reproach
may
come
to
taint
the
tenderness
of
the
first
offices
of
gratitude
that
you
will
perform
over
my
tomb
yes
i
have
prolonged
without
any
benefit
to
you
an
experiment
of
general
interest
to
others
i
ought
to
have
remained
faithful
to
my
first
intention
and
restored
your
life
immediately
after
the
signature
of
peace
but
what
was
it
well
to
send
you
back
to
france
when
the
sun
of
your
fatherland
was
obscured
by
our
soldiers
and
allies
i
have
spared
you
that
spectacle
one
so
grievous
to
such
a
soul
as
yours
without
doubt
you
would
have
had
in
march
the
consolation
of
again
seeing
that
fatal
man
to
whom
you
had
consecrated
your
devotion
but
are
you
entirely
sure
that
you
would
not
have
been
swallowed
up
with
his
fortune
in
the
shipwreck
of
waterloo
for
five
or
six
years
past
it
has
not
been
your
welfare
nor
even
the
welfare
of
science
that
prevented
me
from
reanimating
you
it
has
been
forgive
me
colonel
it
has
been
a
cowardly
attachment
to
life
the
disorder
from
which
i
am
suffering
and
which
will
soon
carry
me
off
is
an
aneurism
of
the
heart
violent
emotions
are
interdicted
to
me
if
i
were
myself
to
undertake
the
grand
operation
whose
process
i
have
traced
in
a
memorandum
annexed
to
this
instrument
i
would
without
any
doubt
succumb
before
finishing
it
my
death
would
be
an
untoward
accident
which
might
trouble
my
assistants
and
cause
your
resuscitation
to
fail
rest
content
you
will
not
have
long
to
wait
and
moreover
what
do
you
lose
by
waiting
you
do
not
grow
old
you
are
always
years
of
age
your
children
are
growing
up
you
will
be
almost
their
contemporary
when
you
come
to
life
again
you
came
to
liebenfeld
poor
you
are
now
in
my
house
poor
and
my
will
makes
you
rich
that
you
may
be
happy
also
is
my
dearest
wish
i
direct
that
the
day
after
my
death
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
shall
call
together
by
letter
the
ten
physicians
most
illustrious
in
the
kingdom
of
prussia
that
he
shall
read
to
them
my
will
and
the
annexed
memorandum
and
that
he
shall
cause
them
to
proceed
without
delay
in
my
own
laboratory
to
the
resuscitation
of
colonel
fougas
the
expenses
of
travel
maintenance
shall
be
deducted
from
the
assets
of
my
estate
the
sum
of
two
thousand
thalers
shall
be
devoted
to
the
publication
of
the
glorious
results
of
the
experiment
in
german
french
and
latin
a
copy
of
this
pamphlet
shall
be
sent
to
each
of
the
learned
societies
then
existing
in
europe
in
the
entirely
unexpected
event
of
the
efforts
of
science
being
unable
to
reanimate
the
colonel
all
my
effects
shall
revert
to
nicholas
meiser
my
sole
surviving
relative
john
meiser
chapter
viii
how
nicholas
meiser
nephew
of
john
meiser
executed
his
uncle
will
doctor
hirtz
of
berlin
who
had
copied
this
will
himself
apologized
very
politely
for
not
having
sent
it
sooner
business
had
obliged
him
to
travel
away
from
the
capital
in
passing
through
dantzic
he
had
given
himself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
herr
nicholas
meiser
the
former
brewer
now
a
very
wealthy
and
heavy
holder
of
stocks
years
of
age
this
old
man
very
well
remembered
the
death
and
will
of
his
uncle
the
but
he
did
not
speak
of
them
without
a
certain
reluctance
moreover
he
said
that
immediately
after
the
decease
of
john
meiser
he
had
called
together
ten
physicians
of
dantzic
around
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
he
showed
also
a
unanimous
statement
of
these
gentlemen
affirming
that
a
man
desiccated
in
a
furnace
can
not
in
any
way
or
by
any
means
return
to
life
this
certificate
drawn
up
by
the
professional
competitors
and
enemies
of
the
deceased
made
no
mention
of
the
paper
annexed
to
the
will
nicholas
meiser
swore
by
all
the
gods
but
not
without
visibly
coloring
that
this
document
concerning
the
methods
to
be
pursued
in
resuscitating
the
colonel
had
never
been
known
by
himself
or
his
wife
when
interrogated
regarding
the
reasons
which
could
have
brought
him
to
part
with
a
trust
as
precious
as
the
body
of
fougas
he
said
that
he
had
kept
it
in
his
house
fifteen
years
with
every
imaginable
respect
and
care
but
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
becoming
beset
with
visions
and
being
awakened
almost
every
night
by
the
colonel
ghost
coming
and
pulling
at
his
feet
he
concluded
to
sell
it
for
twenty
crowns
to
a
berlin
amateur
since
he
had
been
rid
of
this
dismal
neighbor
he
had
slept
a
great
deal
better
but
not
entirely
well
yet
for
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
forget
the
apparition
of
the
colonel
to
these
revelations
herr
hirtz
physician
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
of
prussia
added
some
remarks
of
his
own
he
did
not
think
that
the
resuscitation
of
a
healthy
man
desiccated
with
precaution
was
impossible
in
theory
he
thought
also
that
the
process
of
desiccation
indicated
by
the
illustrious
john
meiser
was
the
best
to
follow
but
in
the
present
case
it
did
not
appear
to
him
probable
that
colonel
fougas
could
be
called
back
to
life
the
atmospheric
influences
and
the
variations
of
temperature
which
he
had
undergone
during
a
period
of
forty
six
years
must
have
altered
the
fluids
and
the
tissues
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
renault
and
his
son
to
quiet
clementine
excitement
a
little
they
read
to
her
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
hirtz
letter
they
kept
from
her
john
will
which
could
have
done
nothing
but
excite
her
but
the
little
imagination
worked
on
without
cessation
do
what
they
would
to
quiet
it
clementine
now
sought
the
company
of
doctor
martout
she
held
discussions
with
him
and
wanted
to
see
experiments
in
the
resuscitation
of
rotifers
when
she
got
home
again
she
would
think
a
little
about
leon
and
a
great
deal
about
the
colonel
the
project
of
marriage
was
still
entertained
but
no
one
ventured
to
speak
about
the
publication
of
the
bans
to
the
most
touching
endearments
of
her
betrothed
the
young
fiancée
responded
with
disquisitions
on
the
vital
principle
her
visits
to
the
renaults
house
were
paid
less
to
the
living
than
to
the
dead
all
the
arguments
they
put
in
use
to
cure
her
of
a
foolish
hope
served
only
to
throw
her
into
a
profound
melancholy
her
beautiful
complexion
grew
pale
the
brilliancy
of
her
glance
died
away
undermined
by
a
hidden
disorder
she
lost
the
amiable
vivacity
which
had
appeared
to
be
the
sparkling
of
youth
and
joy
the
change
must
have
been
very
noticeable
for
even
mlle
sambucco
who
had
not
a
mother
eyes
was
troubled
about
it
martout
satisfied
that
this
malady
of
the
spirit
would
not
yield
to
any
but
a
moral
treatment
came
to
see
her
one
morning
and
said
my
dear
child
although
i
can
not
well
explain
to
myself
the
great
interest
that
you
take
in
this
mummy
i
have
done
something
for
it
and
for
you
i
am
going
to
send
the
little
piece
of
ear
that
leon
broke
off
to
karl
nibor
clementine
opened
all
her
eyes
do
you
understand
me
continued
the
doctor
the
thing
is
to
find
out
whether
the
humors
and
tissues
of
the
colonel
have
undergone
material
alterations
nibor
with
his
microscope
will
tell
us
the
state
of
things
one
can
rely
upon
him
he
is
an
infallible
genius
his
answer
will
tell
us
if
it
be
well
to
proceed
to
the
resuscitation
of
our
man
or
whether
nothing
is
left
but
to
bury
him
what
cried
the
young
girl
one
can
tell
whether
a
man
is
dead
or
living
by
sample
nothing
more
is
required
by
doctor
nibor
forget
your
anxieties
then
for
a
week
as
soon
as
the
answer
comes
i
will
give
it
to
you
to
read
i
have
stimulated
the
curiosity
of
the
great
physiologist
he
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
the
fragment
i
send
him
but
if
to
suppose
an
impossibility
he
tells
us
that
the
piece
of
ear
belongs
to
a
sound
being
i
will
beg
him
to
come
to
fontainebleau
and
help
us
restore
his
life
this
vague
glimmer
of
hope
dissipated
clementine
melancholy
and
brought
back
her
buoyant
health
she
again
began
to
sing
and
laugh
and
flutter
about
the
garden
at
her
aunt
and
the
house
at
renault
the
tender
communings
began
again
the
wedding
was
once
more
talked
over
and
the
first
ban
was
published
at
last
said
leon
i
have
found
her
again
but
madame
renault
that
wise
and
cautious
mother
shook
her
head
sadly
all
this
goes
but
half
well
said
she
i
do
not
like
to
have
my
so
absorbed
with
that
handsome
fellow
what
are
we
to
expect
when
she
knows
that
it
is
impossible
to
bring
him
to
life
again
will
the
black
butterflies
then
fly
away
and
suppose
they
happen
by
a
miracle
to
reanimate
him
are
you
sure
she
will
not
fall
in
love
with
him
indeed
leon
must
have
thought
it
very
necessary
to
buy
this
mummy
and
i
call
it
money
well
invested
one
sunday
morning
martout
rushed
in
upon
the
old
professor
shouting
victory
here
is
the
answer
which
had
come
to
him
from
paris
my
dear
i
have
received
your
letter
and
the
little
fragment
of
tissue
whose
nature
you
asked
me
to
determine
it
did
not
cost
me
much
trouble
to
find
out
the
matter
in
question
i
have
done
more
difficult
things
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
experiments
relating
to
medical
jurisprudence
you
could
have
saved
yourself
the
use
of
the
established
formula
when
you
shall
have
made
your
microscopic
examination
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
these
little
tricks
amount
to
nothing
my
microscope
knows
better
than
you
do
what
you
have
sent
me
you
know
the
form
and
color
of
things
sees
their
inmost
nature
the
laws
of
their
being
the
conditions
of
their
life
and
death
your
fragment
of
desiccated
matter
half
as
broad
as
my
nail
and
nearly
as
thick
after
remaining
for
hours
under
a
in
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
water
at
the
temperature
of
the
human
body
became
supple
so
much
so
as
to
be
a
little
elastic
i
could
consequently
dissect
it
study
it
like
a
piece
of
fresh
flesh
and
put
under
the
microscope
each
one
of
its
parts
that
appeared
different
in
consistency
or
color
from
the
rest
i
at
once
found
in
the
middle
a
slight
portion
harder
and
more
elastic
than
the
rest
which
presented
the
texture
and
cellular
structure
of
cartilage
this
was
neither
the
cartilage
of
the
nose
nor
the
cartilage
of
an
articulation
but
certainly
the
of
the
ear
you
sent
me
then
the
end
of
an
ear
and
it
is
not
the
lower
end
the
lobe
which
women
pierce
to
put
their
gold
ornaments
in
but
the
upper
end
into
which
the
cartilage
extends
on
the
i
took
off
a
fine
skin
in
which
the
microscope
showed
me
an
epidermis
delicate
perfectly
intact
a
derma
no
less
intact
with
little
papillæ
and
moreover
covered
with
a
lot
of
fine
human
hairs
each
of
these
little
hairs
had
its
root
imbedded
in
its
follicle
and
the
follicle
accompanied
by
its
two
little
glands
i
will
tell
you
even
more
these
hairs
of
down
were
from
four
to
five
millimetres
long
by
from
three
to
five
hundredths
of
a
millimetre
in
diameter
this
is
twice
the
size
of
the
pretty
down
which
grows
on
a
feminine
ear
from
which
i
conclude
that
your
piece
of
ear
belongs
to
a
man
against
the
curved
edge
of
the
cartilage
i
found
delicate
striated
bunches
of
the
muscle
of
the
helix
and
so
perfectly
intact
that
one
would
have
said
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
their
contracting
under
the
skin
and
near
the
muscles
i
found
several
little
nervous
filaments
each
one
composed
of
eight
or
ten
tubes
in
which
the
medulla
was
as
intact
and
homogeneous
as
in
nerves
removed
from
a
living
animal
or
taken
from
an
amputated
limb
are
you
satisfied
do
you
cry
mercy
well
as
for
me
i
am
not
yet
at
the
end
of
my
string
in
the
cellular
tissue
interposed
between
the
cartilage
and
the
skin
i
found
little
arteries
and
little
veins
whose
structure
was
perfectly
cognizable
they
contained
some
serum
with
red
blood
globules
these
globules
were
all
of
them
circular
biconcave
and
perfectly
regular
they
showed
neither
indentations
nor
that
appearance
which
characterizes
the
blood
globules
of
a
corpse
to
sum
up
my
dear
i
have
found
in
this
fragment
nearly
everything
that
is
found
in
the
human
body
cartilage
muscle
nerve
skin
hairs
glands
blood
and
all
this
in
a
perfectly
healthy
and
normal
state
it
is
not
then
a
piece
of
a
corpse
which
you
sent
me
but
a
piece
of
a
living
man
whose
humors
and
tissues
are
in
no
way
decomposed
with
high
consideration
yours
karl
nibor
paris
chapter
ix
considerable
of
a
disturbance
in
fontainebleau
it
did
not
take
long
to
get
spread
about
the
town
that
martout
and
the
messieurs
renault
intended
in
conjunction
with
several
paris
to
resuscitate
a
dead
man
martout
had
sent
a
detailed
account
of
the
case
to
the
celebrated
karl
nibor
who
had
hastened
to
lay
it
before
the
biological
society
a
committee
was
forthwith
appointed
to
accompany
nibor
to
fontainebleau
the
six
commissioners
and
the
reporter
agreed
to
leave
paris
the
of
august
being
glad
to
escape
the
din
of
the
public
rejoicings
martout
was
notified
to
get
things
ready
for
the
experiment
which
would
probably
last
not
less
than
three
days
some
of
the
paris
papers
announced
this
great
event
among
their
miscellaneous
items
but
the
public
paid
little
attention
to
it
the
grand
reception
of
the
army
returning
from
italy
engrossed
interest
and
moreover
the
french
do
not
put
more
than
moderate
faith
in
miracles
promised
in
the
newspapers
but
at
fontainebleau
it
was
an
entirely
different
matter
not
only
monsieur
martout
and
the
messieurs
renault
but
audret
the
architect
bonnivet
the
notary
and
a
dozen
other
of
the
bigwigs
of
the
town
had
seen
and
touched
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
they
had
spoken
about
it
to
their
friends
had
described
it
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
had
recounted
its
history
two
or
three
copies
of
herr
meiser
will
were
circulating
from
hand
to
hand
the
question
of
reanimations
was
the
order
of
the
day
they
discussed
it
around
the
like
the
academy
of
sciences
at
a
full
meeting
even
in
the
you
could
have
heard
them
talking
about
rotifers
and
tardigrades
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
resuscitationists
were
not
in
the
majority
a
few
professors
of
the
college
noted
for
the
paradoxical
character
of
their
minds
a
few
lovers
of
the
marvellous
who
had
been
duly
convicted
of
and
to
top
off
with
a
half
dozen
of
those
old
grumblers
who
believe
that
the
death
of
napoleon
is
a
calumnious
lie
set
afloat
by
the
english
constituted
the
whole
of
the
army
martout
had
against
him
not
only
the
skeptics
but
the
innumerable
crowd
of
believers
in
the
bargain
one
party
turned
him
to
ridicule
the
others
proclaimed
him
revolutionary
dangerous
and
an
enemy
of
the
fundamental
ideas
on
which
society
rests
the
minister
of
one
little
church
preached
in
inuendoes
against
the
prometheuses
who
aspired
to
usurp
the
prerogatives
of
heaven
but
the
rector
of
the
parish
did
not
hesitate
to
say
in
five
or
six
houses
that
the
cure
of
a
man
as
desperately
sick
as
fougas
would
be
an
evidence
of
the
power
and
mercy
of
god
the
garrison
of
fontainebleau
was
at
that
time
composed
of
four
squadrons
of
cuirassiers
and
the
regiment
of
the
line
which
had
distinguished
itself
at
magenta
as
soon
as
it
was
known
in
colonel
fougas
old
regiment
that
that
illustrious
officer
was
possibly
going
to
return
to
the
world
there
was
a
general
sensation
a
regiment
knows
its
history
and
the
history
of
the
had
been
that
of
fougas
from
february
to
november
all
the
soldiers
had
heard
read
at
their
messes
the
following
anecdote
on
the
of
august
at
the
battle
of
dresden
the
emperor
noticed
a
french
regiment
at
the
foot
of
a
russian
redoubt
which
was
pouring
grape
upon
it
he
asked
what
regiment
it
was
and
was
told
that
it
was
the
of
the
line
impossible
said
he
of
the
line
never
stood
under
fire
without
rushing
upon
the
artillery
thundering
at
it
at
that
moment
the
led
by
colonel
fougas
rushed
up
the
height
at
double
quick
pinned
the
artillerists
to
their
guns
and
took
the
redoubt
the
officers
and
soldiers
justly
proud
of
this
memorable
action
venerated
under
the
name
of
fougas
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
regiment
the
idea
of
seeing
him
appear
in
the
midst
of
them
young
and
living
did
not
appear
likely
but
it
was
already
something
to
be
in
possession
of
his
body
officers
and
soldiers
decided
that
he
should
be
interred
at
their
expense
after
the
experiments
of
doctor
martout
were
completed
and
to
give
him
a
tomb
worthy
of
his
glory
they
voted
an
assessment
of
two
days
pay
every
one
who
wore
an
epaulette
visited
renault
laboratory
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
went
there
several
times
in
hopes
of
meeting
clementine
but
leon
betrothed
kept
herself
out
of
the
way
she
was
happier
than
any
woman
had
ever
been
this
pretty
little
clementine
no
cloud
longer
disturbed
the
serenity
of
her
fair
brow
free
from
all
anxieties
with
a
heart
opened
to
hope
she
adored
her
dear
leon
and
passed
her
days
in
telling
him
so
she
herself
had
pressed
the
publication
of
the
bans
we
will
be
married
said
she
the
day
after
the
resuscitation
of
the
colonel
i
intend
that
he
shall
give
me
away
i
want
him
to
bless
me
that
is
certainly
the
least
he
can
do
for
me
after
all
i
have
done
for
him
it
is
certain
that
but
for
my
opposition
you
would
have
sent
him
to
the
museum
of
the
des
i
will
tell
him
all
this
sir
as
soon
as
he
can
understand
us
and
he
will
cut
ears
off
in
turn
i
love
you
but
answered
leon
why
do
you
make
my
happiness
dependent
on
the
success
of
an
experiment
all
the
usual
formalities
are
executed
the
publications
made
the
notices
given
no
one
in
the
world
can
prevent
our
marrying
and
you
are
pleased
to
wait
until
the
what
connection
is
there
between
us
and
this
desiccated
gentleman
asleep
in
his
box
he
does
belong
to
your
family
or
mine
i
have
examined
all
your
family
records
back
to
the
sixth
generation
and
i
have
found
anybody
of
the
name
of
fougas
in
them
so
we
are
not
waiting
for
a
grandfather
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
who
is
he
then
the
wicked
tongues
of
fontainebleau
pretend
that
you
have
a
for
this
fetich
of
as
for
me
who
am
sure
of
your
heart
i
trust
that
you
will
never
love
any
one
as
well
as
me
however
they
call
me
the
rival
of
the
sleeping
colonel
in
the
wood
let
the
fools
prate
responded
clementine
with
an
angelic
smile
i
do
not
trouble
myself
to
explain
my
affection
for
poor
fougas
but
i
love
him
very
much
that
certain
i
love
him
as
a
father
as
a
brother
if
you
prefer
it
for
he
is
almost
as
young
as
i
when
we
have
resuscitated
him
i
will
love
him
perhaps
as
a
son
but
you
will
lose
nothing
by
it
dear
leon
you
have
in
my
heart
a
place
by
itself
the
best
too
and
no
one
shall
take
it
from
you
not
even
this
lovers
quarrel
which
often
began
and
always
ended
with
a
kiss
was
one
day
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
the
commissioner
of
police
this
honorable
functionary
politely
declined
to
give
his
name
and
business
and
requested
the
favor
of
a
private
interview
with
young
renault
monsieur
said
he
when
he
saw
him
alone
i
appreciate
all
the
consideration
due
to
a
man
of
your
character
and
position
and
i
hope
you
will
see
fit
not
to
interpret
unpleasantly
a
proceeding
which
is
prompted
in
me
by
a
sense
of
duty
leon
opened
his
eyes
and
waited
for
the
continuation
of
the
discourse
you
are
aware
monsieur
pursued
the
commissioner
of
what
is
required
by
the
law
concerning
interments
it
is
express
and
admits
no
exception
the
authorities
can
keep
their
eyes
shut
but
the
great
tumult
that
has
arisen
and
moreover
the
rank
of
the
deceased
without
taking
into
account
the
religious
considerations
put
us
under
obligation
to
proceed
in
conjunction
with
you
let
it
be
well
understood
leon
comprehended
little
by
little
the
commissioner
finished
by
explaining
to
him
always
in
the
administrative
style
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
have
fougas
taken
to
the
town
cemetery
but
monsieur
replied
the
engineer
if
you
have
heard
people
speaking
of
colonel
fougas
they
ought
to
have
told
you
withal
that
we
do
not
consider
him
dead
nonsense
answered
the
commissioner
with
a
slight
smile
opinions
are
free
but
the
doctor
whose
office
it
is
to
attend
to
the
disposition
of
the
dead
and
who
has
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
deceased
has
made
us
a
conclusive
report
which
points
to
immediate
interment
very
well
monsieur
if
fougas
is
dead
we
are
in
hopes
of
resuscitating
him
so
we
have
been
told
already
monsieur
but
for
my
part
i
hesitated
to
believe
it
you
will
believe
it
when
you
have
seen
it
and
i
hope
monsieur
that
that
will
be
before
long
but
then
monsieur
have
you
fixed
everything
in
due
form
with
whom
i
do
not
know
monsieur
but
i
suppose
that
before
undertaking
such
a
thing
as
this
you
have
fortified
yourself
with
some
legal
authorization
from
whom
but
at
all
events
monsieur
you
admit
that
the
reanimation
of
a
man
is
an
extraordinary
affair
as
for
myself
this
is
really
the
first
time
that
i
ever
heard
it
spoken
of
now
the
duty
of
a
well
regulated
police
is
to
prevent
anything
extraordinary
happening
in
the
country
let
us
see
monsieur
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
is
a
man
who
is
not
dead
i
have
a
hope
of
setting
him
on
his
feet
in
three
days
your
doctor
who
maintains
the
contrary
deceives
himself
would
you
take
the
responsibility
of
having
fougas
buried
certainly
not
god
forbid
that
i
should
take
any
responsibility
of
any
kind
on
my
shoulders
but
however
monsieur
in
having
fougas
buried
i
would
act
in
accordance
with
law
and
order
now
after
all
by
what
right
do
you
presume
to
resuscitate
a
man
in
what
country
is
resuscitation
customary
where
is
the
precept
of
law
which
authorizes
you
to
resuscitate
people
do
you
know
any
law
that
prohibits
it
now
everything
that
is
not
prohibited
is
permitted
in
the
eyes
of
the
magistrates
very
likely
but
the
police
ought
to
prevent
and
stem
disorder
now
a
resuscitation
monsieur
is
a
thing
so
unheard
of
as
to
constitute
an
actual
disorder
you
will
admit
nevertheless
that
it
is
a
very
happy
disorder
there
no
such
thing
as
a
happy
disorder
consider
morever
that
the
deceased
is
not
a
common
sort
of
a
man
if
the
question
concerned
a
vagabond
without
house
or
home
one
could
use
some
tolerance
in
regard
to
it
but
this
is
a
soldier
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
decorated
too
a
man
who
has
occupied
an
exalted
position
in
the
army
the
monsieur
it
will
not
do
to
touch
the
army
eh
monsieur
i
touch
the
army
like
a
surgeon
who
tends
its
wounds
it
is
proposed
to
restore
to
the
army
a
colonel
and
you
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
routine
wish
to
rob
it
of
one
do
get
so
excited
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
and
do
talk
so
loud
people
can
hear
us
believe
me
i
will
meet
you
half
way
in
anything
you
want
to
do
for
the
great
and
glorious
army
of
my
country
but
have
you
considered
the
religious
question
what
religious
question
to
tell
you
the
truth
monsieur
but
this
entirely
between
ourselves
what
we
have
spoken
of
so
far
is
purely
accessory
and
we
are
now
touching
upon
the
delicate
point
people
have
come
to
see
me
and
have
made
some
very
judicious
remarks
to
me
the
mere
announcement
of
your
project
has
cast
a
good
deal
of
trouble
into
certain
consciences
they
fear
that
the
success
of
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
may
strike
a
blow
at
the
faith
may
in
a
word
scandalize
many
tranquil
spirits
for
if
fougas
is
dead
of
course
it
is
because
god
has
so
willed
it
you
afraid
of
acting
contrary
to
the
will
of
god
in
resuscitating
him
no
monsieur
for
i
am
sure
not
to
resuscitate
fougas
if
god
has
willed
it
otherwise
god
permits
a
man
to
catch
the
fever
but
god
also
permits
a
doctor
to
cure
him
god
permitted
a
brave
soldier
of
the
emperor
to
be
captured
by
four
drunken
russians
condemned
as
a
spy
frozen
in
a
fortress
and
desiccated
under
an
by
an
old
german
but
god
also
permitted
me
to
find
this
unfortunate
man
in
a
to
carry
him
to
fontainebleau
to
examine
him
with
certain
men
of
science
and
to
agree
with
them
upon
a
method
almost
sure
to
restore
him
to
life
all
this
proves
one
thing
which
is
that
god
is
more
just
more
merciful
and
more
inclined
to
pity
than
those
who
abuse
his
name
in
order
to
excite
you
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
excited
i
yield
to
your
reasons
because
they
are
good
ones
and
because
you
are
a
man
of
consideration
in
the
community
i
sincerely
hope
moreover
that
you
will
not
think
harshly
of
an
act
of
zeal
which
i
have
been
advised
to
perform
i
am
a
functionary
monsieur
now
what
is
a
functionary
a
man
who
holds
a
place
suppose
now
that
functionaries
were
to
expose
themselves
to
the
loss
of
their
places
what
would
stand
firm
in
france
nothing
monsieur
absolutely
nothing
i
have
the
honor
to
bid
you
good
day
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
karl
nibor
presented
himself
at
renault
with
doctor
martont
and
the
committee
appointed
by
the
biological
society
of
paris
as
often
happens
in
the
rural
districts
the
first
appearance
of
our
illustrious
savant
was
a
sort
of
disappointment
mme
renault
expected
to
see
if
not
a
magician
in
a
velvet
robe
studded
with
gold
at
least
an
old
man
of
extraordinarily
grave
and
impressive
appearance
karl
nibor
is
a
man
of
middle
height
very
fair
and
very
slight
possibly
he
carries
a
good
forty
years
but
one
would
not
credit
him
with
more
than
he
wears
a
moustache
and
imperial
is
lively
a
good
conversationist
agreeable
and
enough
of
a
man
of
the
world
to
amuse
the
ladies
but
clementine
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
his
conversation
her
aunt
had
taken
her
to
moret
in
order
to
remove
her
from
the
pangs
of
fear
as
well
as
from
the
intoxications
of
victory
chapter
hallelujah
nibor
and
his
colleagues
after
the
usual
compliments
requested
to
see
the
subject
they
had
no
time
to
lose
as
the
experiment
could
hardly
last
less
than
three
days
leon
hastened
to
conduct
them
to
the
laboratory
and
to
open
the
three
boxes
containing
the
colonel
they
found
that
the
patient
presented
quite
a
favorable
appearance
nibor
took
off
his
clothes
which
tore
like
tinder
from
having
been
too
much
dried
in
father
meiser
furnace
the
body
when
naked
was
pronounced
entirely
free
from
blemish
and
in
a
perfectly
healthy
condition
no
one
would
yet
have
guaranteed
success
but
every
one
was
full
of
hope
after
this
preliminary
examination
renault
put
his
laboratory
at
the
service
of
his
guests
he
offered
them
all
that
he
possessed
with
a
munificence
which
was
not
entirely
free
from
vanity
in
case
the
employment
of
electricity
should
appear
necessary
he
had
a
powerful
battery
of
leyden
jars
and
forty
of
bunsen
elements
which
were
entirely
new
nibor
thanked
him
smilingly
save
your
riches
said
he
with
a
and
caldron
of
boiling
water
we
will
have
everything
we
need
the
colonel
needs
nothing
but
humidity
the
thing
is
to
give
him
the
quantity
of
water
necessary
to
the
play
of
the
organs
if
you
have
a
small
room
where
one
can
introduce
a
jet
of
vapor
we
will
be
more
than
content
audret
the
architect
had
very
wisely
built
a
little
near
the
laboratory
which
was
convenient
and
well
lighted
the
celebrated
steam
engine
was
not
far
off
and
its
boiler
had
not
up
to
this
time
answered
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
warming
the
baths
of
and
mme
renault
the
colonel
was
carried
into
this
room
with
all
the
care
necessitated
by
his
fragility
it
was
not
intended
to
break
his
second
ear
in
the
hurry
of
moving
leon
ran
to
light
the
fire
under
the
boiler
and
nibor
created
him
fireman
on
the
field
of
battle
soon
a
jet
of
tepid
vapor
streamed
into
the
creating
around
the
colonel
a
humid
atmosphere
which
was
elevated
by
degrees
and
without
any
sudden
increase
to
the
temperature
of
the
human
body
these
conditions
of
heat
and
humidity
were
maintained
with
the
greatest
care
for
hours
no
one
in
the
house
went
to
sleep
the
members
of
the
parisian
committee
encamped
in
the
laboratory
leon
kept
up
the
fire
nibor
renault
and
martout
took
turns
in
watching
the
thermometer
madame
renault
was
making
tea
and
coffee
and
punch
too
gothon
who
had
taken
communion
in
the
morning
kept
praying
to
god
in
the
corner
of
her
kitchen
that
this
impious
miracle
might
not
succeed
a
certain
excitement
already
prevailed
throughout
the
town
but
one
did
not
know
whether
it
should
be
attributed
to
the
of
the
or
the
famous
undertaking
of
the
seven
wise
men
of
paris
by
two
on
the
encouraging
results
were
obtained
the
skin
and
muscles
had
recovered
nearly
all
their
suppleness
but
the
joints
were
still
hard
to
bend
the
collapsed
condition
of
the
walls
of
the
abdomen
and
the
interval
between
the
ribs
still
indicated
that
the
viscera
were
far
from
having
reabsorbed
the
quantity
of
water
which
they
had
previously
lost
with
herr
meiser
a
bath
was
prepared
and
kept
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
and
a
half
they
left
the
colonel
in
it
two
hours
and
a
half
taking
care
to
frequently
pass
over
his
head
a
fine
sponge
soaked
with
water
nibor
removed
him
from
the
bath
as
soon
as
the
skin
which
was
filled
out
sooner
than
the
other
tissues
began
to
assume
a
whitish
tinge
and
wrinkle
slightly
they
kept
him
until
the
evening
of
the
in
this
humid
room
where
they
arranged
an
apparatus
which
from
time
to
time
occasioned
a
fine
rain
of
a
temperature
of
and
a
half
degrees
a
new
bath
was
given
in
the
evening
during
the
night
the
body
was
enveloped
in
flannel
but
kept
constantly
in
the
same
steaming
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
the
after
a
third
bath
of
an
hour
and
a
half
the
general
characteristics
of
the
figure
and
the
proportions
of
the
body
presented
their
natural
aspect
one
would
have
called
it
a
sleeping
man
five
or
six
curious
persons
were
admitted
to
see
it
among
others
the
colonel
of
the
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
nibor
moved
successively
all
the
joints
and
demonstrated
that
they
had
recovered
their
flexibility
he
gently
kneaded
the
limbs
trunk
and
abdomen
he
partly
opened
the
lips
and
separated
the
jaws
which
were
quite
firmly
closed
and
saw
that
the
tongue
had
returned
to
its
ordinary
size
and
consistency
he
also
partly
opened
the
eyelids
the
were
firm
and
bright
gentlemen
said
the
philosopher
these
are
indications
which
do
not
deceive
i
prophesy
success
in
a
few
hours
you
shall
witness
the
first
manifestations
of
life
but
interrupted
one
of
the
bystanders
why
not
immediately
because
the
are
still
a
little
paler
than
they
ought
to
be
but
the
little
veins
traversing
the
whites
of
the
eyes
have
already
assumed
a
very
encouraging
appearance
the
blood
is
almost
entirely
restored
what
is
the
blood
red
globules
floating
in
serum
or
a
sort
of
whey
the
serum
in
poor
fougas
was
dried
up
in
his
veins
the
water
which
we
have
gradually
introduced
by
a
slow
endosmose
has
saturated
the
albumen
and
fibrin
of
the
serum
which
is
returned
to
the
liquid
state
the
red
globules
which
desiccation
had
agglutinated
had
become
motionless
like
ships
stranded
in
shoal
water
now
behold
them
afloat
again
they
thicken
swell
round
out
their
edges
detach
themselves
from
each
other
and
prepare
to
circulate
in
their
proper
channels
at
the
first
impulse
which
shall
be
given
them
by
the
contractions
of
the
heart
it
remains
to
see
said
renault
whether
the
heart
will
put
itself
in
motion
in
a
living
man
the
heart
moves
under
the
impulse
of
the
brain
transmitted
by
the
nerves
the
brain
acts
under
the
impulse
of
the
heart
transmitted
by
the
arteries
the
whole
forms
a
perfectly
exact
circle
without
which
there
is
no
and
when
neither
heart
nor
brain
acts
as
in
the
colonel
case
i
do
see
which
of
the
two
can
set
the
other
in
motion
you
remember
the
scene
in
the
des
where
arnolphe
knocks
at
his
door
the
valet
and
the
maid
alain
and
georgette
are
both
in
the
house
cries
replies
the
door
down
there
yourself
go
yourself
me
i
sha
go
sha
go
either
it
right
away
it
yourself
and
nobody
opens
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
monsieur
that
we
are
attending
a
performance
of
this
comedy
the
house
is
the
body
of
the
colonel
arnolphe
who
wants
to
get
in
is
the
vital
principle
the
heart
and
brain
act
the
parts
of
alain
and
georgette
the
door
says
it
yourself
says
the
other
and
the
vital
principle
waits
outside
monsieur
replied
doctor
nibor
smiling
you
forget
the
ending
of
the
scene
arnolphe
gets
angry
and
cries
out
of
you
two
open
the
door
sha
have
anything
to
eat
for
four
days
and
forthwith
alain
hurries
himself
georgette
runs
and
the
door
is
opened
now
bear
in
mind
that
i
speak
in
this
way
only
in
order
to
conform
to
your
own
course
of
reasoning
for
the
term
principle
is
at
variance
with
the
actual
assertions
of
science
life
will
manifest
itself
as
soon
as
the
brain
or
the
heart
or
any
one
of
the
organs
which
have
the
capacity
of
working
spontaneously
shall
have
absorbed
the
quantity
of
water
it
needs
organized
matter
has
inherent
properties
which
manifest
themselves
without
the
assistance
of
any
foreign
principle
whenever
they
are
surrounded
by
certain
conditions
why
do
not
fougas
muscles
contract
yet
why
does
not
the
tissue
of
the
brain
enter
into
action
because
they
have
not
yet
the
amount
of
moisture
necessary
to
them
in
the
fountain
of
life
there
is
lacking
perhaps
a
pint
of
water
but
i
shall
be
in
no
hurry
to
refill
it
i
am
too
much
afraid
of
breaking
it
before
giving
this
gallant
fellow
a
final
bath
it
will
be
necessary
to
knead
all
his
organs
again
to
subject
his
abdomen
to
regular
compressions
in
order
that
the
serous
membranes
of
the
stomach
chest
and
heart
may
be
perfectly
disagglutinated
and
capable
of
slipping
on
each
other
you
are
aware
that
the
slightest
tear
in
these
parts
or
the
least
resistance
would
be
enough
to
kill
our
subject
at
the
moment
of
his
revival
while
speaking
he
united
example
to
precept
and
kept
kneading
the
trunk
of
the
colonel
as
the
spectators
had
too
nearly
filled
the
making
it
almost
impossible
to
move
nibor
begged
them
to
move
into
the
laboratory
but
the
laboratory
became
so
full
that
it
was
necessary
to
leave
it
for
the
parlor
the
committee
of
the
biological
society
had
scarcely
a
corner
of
the
table
on
which
to
draw
up
their
account
of
the
proceedings
the
parlor
even
was
crowded
with
people
the
dining
room
too
and
so
out
to
the
court
yard
of
the
house
friends
strangers
people
not
at
all
known
to
the
family
elbowed
each
other
and
waited
in
silence
but
the
silence
of
a
crowd
is
not
much
less
noisy
than
the
rolling
of
the
sea
fat
doctor
martout
apparently
overwhelmed
with
responsibility
showed
himself
from
time
to
time
and
surged
through
the
waves
of
curious
people
like
a
galleon
laden
with
news
every
one
of
his
words
circulated
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
spread
even
through
the
street
where
several
groups
of
soldiers
and
citizens
were
making
a
stir
in
more
senses
than
one
never
had
the
little
rue
de
la
faisanderie
seen
such
a
crowd
an
astonished
stopped
and
inquired
what
the
matter
here
is
it
a
funeral
quite
the
reverse
sir
a
christening
then
with
warm
water
a
birth
a
being
born
again
an
old
judge
of
the
civil
court
was
recounting
to
a
deputy
the
legend
of
æson
of
old
who
was
boiled
in
medea
caldron
this
is
almost
the
same
experiment
said
he
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
poets
have
calumniated
the
sorceress
of
colchis
there
could
be
some
fine
latin
verses
made
appropriate
to
this
occasion
but
i
no
longer
possess
my
old
skill
medeam
cur
crimine
carpit
iniquo
ecce
novus
surgit
redivivus
æson
ab
undis
fortior
arma
petens
juvenili
pectore
miles
redivivus
is
taken
in
the
active
sense
it
a
license
or
at
least
a
bold
construction
ah
monsieur
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
even
among
those
who
made
the
most
confident
attempts
man
for
latin
verses
said
a
conscript
of
the
levy
of
what
is
it
freminot
is
it
true
that
they
are
boiling
an
old
soldier
in
a
pot
and
that
they
are
going
to
get
him
up
again
colonel
uniform
and
all
true
or
not
subaltern
i
run
the
risk
of
saying
it
true
i
fancy
with
all
proper
deference
that
they
will
not
make
much
at
it
you
should
know
freminot
that
nothing
is
impossible
to
your
superiors
you
are
not
unaware
even
now
that
dried
vegetables
on
being
boiled
recover
their
original
and
natural
appearance
but
if
one
were
to
cook
them
three
days
time
dissolve
into
broth
but
imbecile
why
should
one
consider
old
soldiers
hard
to
cook
at
noon
the
commisioner
of
police
and
the
lieutenant
of
made
way
through
the
crowd
and
entered
the
house
these
gentlemen
hastened
to
declare
to
renault
that
their
visit
had
nothing
of
an
official
character
but
that
they
had
come
merely
from
curiosity
in
the
corridor
they
met
the
the
mayor
and
gothon
who
was
lamenting
in
loud
tones
that
she
should
see
the
government
lend
its
hand
to
such
sorceries
about
one
nibor
caused
a
new
and
prolonged
bath
to
be
given
the
colonel
on
coming
out
of
which
the
body
was
subjected
to
a
kneading
harder
and
more
complete
than
before
now
said
the
doctor
we
can
carry
fougas
into
the
laboratory
in
order
to
give
his
resuscitation
all
the
publicity
desirable
but
it
will
be
well
to
dress
him
and
his
uniform
is
in
tatters
i
think
answered
good
renault
that
the
colonel
is
about
my
size
so
i
can
lend
him
some
of
my
clothes
heaven
grant
that
he
may
use
them
but
between
us
i
do
hope
for
it
gothon
brought
in
grumbling
all
that
was
necessary
to
dress
an
entirely
naked
man
but
her
bad
humor
did
not
hold
out
before
the
beauty
of
the
colonel
poor
gentleman
she
exclaimed
he
is
young
fresh
and
fair
as
a
little
chicken
if
he
does
revive
it
will
be
a
great
pity
there
were
about
forty
people
in
the
laboratory
when
fougas
was
carried
thither
nibor
assisted
by
martout
placed
him
on
a
sofa
and
begged
a
few
moments
of
attentive
silence
during
these
proceedings
mme
renault
sent
to
inquire
if
she
could
come
in
she
was
admitted
madame
and
gentlemen
said
nibor
life
will
manifest
itself
in
a
few
minutes
it
is
possible
that
the
muscles
will
act
first
and
that
their
action
may
be
convulsive
on
account
of
not
yet
being
regulated
by
the
influence
of
the
nervous
system
i
ought
to
apprise
you
of
this
fact
in
order
that
you
may
not
be
frightened
if
such
a
thing
transpires
madame
being
a
mother
ought
to
be
less
astonished
at
it
than
any
one
else
she
has
experienced
at
the
fourth
month
of
pregnancy
the
effect
of
those
irregular
movements
which
will
possibly
soon
be
presented
to
us
on
a
larger
scale
i
am
quite
hopeful
however
that
the
first
spontaneous
contractions
will
take
place
in
the
fibres
of
the
heart
such
is
the
case
in
the
embryo
where
the
rhythmic
movements
of
the
heart
precede
the
nervous
functions
he
again
began
making
systematic
compressions
of
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
rubbing
the
skin
with
his
hands
half
opening
the
eyelids
examining
the
pulse
and
auscultating
the
region
of
the
heart
the
attention
of
the
spectators
was
diverted
an
instant
by
a
hubbub
outside
a
battalion
of
the
was
passing
with
music
at
the
head
through
the
rue
de
la
faisanderie
while
the
were
shaking
the
windows
a
sudden
flash
mantled
on
the
cheeks
of
the
colonel
his
eyes
which
had
stood
half
open
lit
up
with
a
brighter
sparkle
at
the
same
instant
doctor
nibor
who
had
his
ear
applied
to
the
chest
cried
i
hear
the
beatings
of
the
heart
scarcely
had
he
spoken
when
the
chest
rose
with
a
violent
inspiration
the
limbs
contracted
the
body
straightened
up
and
out
came
a
cry
but
as
if
so
great
an
effort
had
overtasked
his
strength
colonel
fougas
fell
back
on
the
sofa
murmuring
in
a
subdued
voice
where
am
i
waiter
bring
me
a
newspaper
chapter
xi
wherein
colonel
fougas
learns
some
news
which
will
appear
old
to
my
readers
among
all
the
persons
present
at
this
scene
there
was
not
a
single
one
who
had
ever
seen
a
resuscitation
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
surprise
and
joy
which
reigned
in
the
laboratory
a
triple
round
of
applause
mingled
with
cheers
hailed
the
triumph
of
doctor
nibor
the
crowd
packed
in
the
parlor
the
passages
the
and
even
in
the
street
understood
at
this
signal
that
the
miracle
was
accomplished
nothing
could
hold
them
back
they
forced
the
doors
cleared
all
obstacles
upset
all
the
philosophers
who
tried
to
stop
them
and
finished
by
pouring
into
the
chamber
of
science
gentlemen
cried
nibor
do
you
want
to
kill
him
but
they
let
him
talk
the
wildest
of
all
passions
curiosity
had
long
held
dominion
over
the
crowd
every
one
wanted
to
see
though
at
the
risk
of
crushing
the
others
nibor
tumbled
down
renault
and
his
son
in
attempting
to
help
him
were
thrown
on
top
of
him
madame
renault
in
her
turn
was
thrown
down
at
the
feet
of
fougas
and
began
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
damnation
said
fougas
straightening
himself
up
as
if
by
a
spring
these
scoundrels
will
suffocate
us
if
some
one
does
squelch
them
his
attitude
the
glare
of
his
eyes
and
above
all
the
prestige
of
the
miraculous
cleared
a
space
around
him
one
would
have
thought
that
the
walls
had
been
stretched
or
that
the
spectators
had
slid
into
one
another
out
of
here
every
mother
son
of
you
cried
fougas
in
his
fiercest
tone
of
command
a
tumult
of
cries
explanations
and
remonstrances
was
raised
around
him
he
fancied
he
heard
menaces
he
seized
the
first
chair
within
reach
brandished
it
like
a
weapon
drove
hammered
upset
the
citizens
soldiers
officials
friends
commissary
of
police
everybody
and
urged
the
human
torrent
into
the
street
with
an
uproar
perfectly
indescribable
this
done
he
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
returned
to
the
laboratory
saw
three
men
standing
near
madame
renault
and
said
to
the
old
lady
softening
the
tone
of
his
voice
well
good
mother
shall
i
serve
these
three
like
the
others
no
no
no
be
careful
cried
the
good
old
lady
my
husband
and
my
son
monsieur
and
doctor
nibor
who
has
restored
you
to
life
in
that
case
all
honor
to
them
good
mother
fougas
has
never
violated
the
laws
of
gratitude
and
hospitality
as
for
you
my
esculapius
give
me
your
hand
at
the
same
instant
he
noticed
ten
or
a
dozen
inquisitive
people
on
tiptoe
on
the
pavement
just
by
the
windows
of
the
laboratory
forthwith
he
marched
and
opened
them
with
a
precipitation
which
upset
the
gazers
among
the
crowd
people
said
he
i
have
knocked
down
a
hundred
beggarly
pandours
who
respect
neither
sex
nor
infirmity
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
satisfied
i
will
state
that
i
call
myself
colonel
fougas
of
the
and
a
confused
mixture
of
plaudits
cries
laughs
and
jeers
answered
this
unprecedented
allocution
leon
renault
hastened
out
to
make
apologies
to
all
to
whom
they
were
due
he
invited
a
few
friends
to
dine
the
same
evening
with
the
terrible
colonel
and
of
course
he
did
not
forget
to
send
a
special
messenger
to
clementine
fougas
after
speaking
to
the
people
returned
to
his
hosts
swinging
himself
along
with
a
swaggering
air
set
himself
astride
a
chair
took
hold
of
the
ends
of
his
moustache
and
said
well
come
let
talk
this
over
i
been
sick
then
very
sick
that
fabulous
i
feel
entirely
well
i
hungry
and
moreover
while
waiting
for
dinner
i
even
try
a
glass
of
your
schnick
mme
renault
went
out
gave
an
order
and
returned
in
an
instant
but
tell
me
then
where
i
am
resumed
the
colonel
by
these
paraphernalia
of
work
i
recognize
a
disciple
of
urania
possibly
a
friend
of
monge
and
berthollet
but
the
cordial
friendliness
impressed
on
your
countenances
proves
to
me
that
you
are
not
natives
of
this
land
of
yes
i
believe
it
from
the
beatings
of
my
heart
friends
we
have
the
same
fatherland
the
kindness
of
your
reception
even
were
there
no
other
indications
would
have
satisfied
me
that
you
are
french
what
accidents
have
brought
you
so
far
from
our
native
soil
children
of
my
country
what
tempest
has
thrown
you
upon
this
inhospitable
shore
my
dear
colonel
replied
nibor
if
you
want
to
become
very
wise
you
will
not
ask
so
many
questions
at
once
allow
us
the
pleasure
of
instructing
you
quietly
and
in
order
for
you
have
a
great
many
things
to
learn
the
colonel
flushed
with
anger
and
answered
sharply
at
all
events
you
are
not
the
man
to
teach
them
to
me
my
little
gentleman
a
drop
of
blood
which
fell
on
his
hand
changed
the
current
of
his
thoughts
hold
on
said
he
am
i
bleeding
that
will
amount
to
nothing
circulation
is
reëstablished
and
your
broken
ear
he
quickly
carried
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
said
it
certainly
so
but
devil
take
me
if
i
recollect
this
accident
i
make
you
a
little
dressing
and
in
a
couple
of
days
there
will
be
no
trace
of
it
left
do
give
yourself
the
trouble
my
dear
hippocrates
a
pinch
of
powder
is
a
sovereign
cure
nibor
set
to
work
to
dress
the
ear
in
a
little
less
military
fashion
during
his
operations
leon
reëntered
ah
ah
said
he
to
the
doctor
you
are
repairing
the
harm
i
did
thunderation
cried
fougas
escaping
from
the
hands
of
nibor
so
as
to
seize
leon
by
the
collar
was
it
you
you
rascal
that
hurt
my
ear
leon
was
very
but
his
patience
failed
him
he
pushed
his
man
roughly
aside
yes
sir
it
was
i
who
tore
your
ear
in
pulling
it
and
if
that
little
misfortune
had
not
happened
to
me
it
is
certain
that
you
would
have
been
six
feet
under
ground
it
is
i
who
saved
your
life
after
buying
you
with
my
money
when
you
were
not
valued
at
more
than
louis
it
is
i
who
have
passed
three
days
and
two
nights
in
cramming
charcoal
under
your
boiler
it
is
my
father
who
gave
you
the
clothes
you
now
have
on
you
are
in
our
house
drink
the
little
glass
of
brandy
gothon
just
brought
you
but
for
god
sake
give
up
the
habit
of
calling
me
rascal
of
calling
my
mother
mother
and
of
flinging
our
friends
into
the
street
and
calling
them
beggarly
pandours
the
colonel
all
dumbfounded
held
out
his
hand
to
leon
renault
and
the
doctor
gallantly
kissed
the
hand
of
mme
renault
swallowed
at
a
gulp
a
claret
glass
filled
to
the
brim
with
brandy
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
most
excellent
friends
forget
the
vagaries
of
an
impulsive
but
generous
soul
to
subdue
my
passions
shall
hereafter
be
my
law
after
conquering
all
the
nations
in
the
universe
it
is
well
to
conquer
self
this
said
he
submitted
his
ear
to
nibor
who
finished
dressing
it
but
said
he
summoning
up
his
recollections
they
did
not
shoot
me
then
no
and
i
was
frozen
to
death
in
the
tower
not
quite
why
has
my
uniform
been
taken
off
i
see
i
am
a
prisoner
you
are
free
free
but
then
there
not
a
moment
to
lose
how
many
leagues
is
it
to
dantzic
it
very
far
what
do
you
call
this
chicken
coop
of
a
town
fontainebleau
fontainebleau
in
france
prefecture
of
we
are
going
to
introduce
to
you
the
whom
you
just
pitched
into
the
street
what
the
devil
are
your
to
me
i
have
a
message
from
the
emperor
for
general
rapp
and
i
must
start
this
very
day
for
dantzic
god
knows
whether
i
be
there
in
time
my
poor
colonel
you
will
arrive
too
late
dantzic
is
given
up
that
impossible
since
when
about
years
ago
thunder
i
did
not
understand
that
you
were
mocking
me
nibor
placed
in
his
hand
a
calendar
and
said
see
for
yourself
it
is
now
the
of
august
you
went
to
sleep
in
the
tower
of
liebenfeld
on
the
of
november
there
have
been
then
years
all
to
three
months
during
which
the
world
has
moved
on
without
you
and
but
then
i
would
be
seventy
years
old
according
to
your
statement
your
vitality
clearly
shows
that
you
are
still
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
tore
up
the
calendar
and
said
beating
the
floor
with
his
foot
your
almanac
is
a
humbug
renault
ran
to
his
library
took
up
half
a
dozen
books
at
haphazard
and
made
him
read
at
the
foot
of
the
title
pages
the
dates
pardon
me
said
fougas
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
what
has
happened
to
me
is
so
new
i
do
not
think
that
another
human
being
was
ever
subjected
to
such
a
trial
i
am
seventy
years
old
good
madame
renault
went
and
got
a
from
the
bath
room
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
look
he
took
the
glass
in
both
hands
and
was
silently
occupied
in
resuming
acquaintance
with
himself
when
a
came
into
the
court
and
began
playing
partant
pour
la
syrie
fougas
threw
the
mirror
to
the
ground
and
cried
out
what
is
that
you
were
telling
me
i
hear
the
little
song
of
queen
hortense
renault
patiently
explained
to
him
while
picking
up
the
pieces
of
the
mirror
that
the
pretty
little
song
of
queen
hortense
had
become
a
national
air
and
even
an
official
one
since
the
regimental
bands
had
substituted
that
gentle
melody
for
the
fierce
marsellaise
and
that
our
soldiers
strange
to
say
had
not
fought
any
the
worse
for
it
but
the
colonel
had
already
opened
the
window
and
was
crying
out
to
the
savoyard
eh
friend
a
napoleon
for
you
if
you
will
tell
me
in
what
year
i
am
drawing
the
breath
of
life
the
artist
began
dancing
as
lightly
as
possible
playing
on
his
musical
instrument
advance
at
the
order
cried
the
colonel
and
keep
that
devilish
machine
still
a
little
penny
my
good
monsieur
it
is
not
a
penny
that
i
give
you
but
a
napoleon
if
you
tell
me
what
year
it
is
oh
but
that
funny
hi
hi
hi
and
if
you
do
tell
me
quicker
than
this
amounts
to
i
cut
your
ears
off
the
savoyard
ran
away
but
he
came
back
pretty
soon
having
meditated
during
his
flight
on
the
maxim
nothing
risk
nothing
gain
monsieur
said
he
in
a
wheedling
voice
this
is
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
good
cried
fougas
he
felt
in
his
pockets
for
money
and
found
nothing
there
leon
saw
his
predicament
and
flung
twenty
francs
into
the
court
before
shutting
the
window
he
pointed
out
to
the
right
the
façade
of
a
pretty
little
new
building
where
the
colonel
could
distinctly
read
audret
architecte
mdccclix
a
perfectly
satisfactory
piece
of
evidence
and
one
which
did
not
cost
twenty
francs
fougas
a
little
confused
pressed
leon
hand
and
said
to
him
my
friend
i
do
not
forget
that
confidence
is
the
first
duty
from
gratitude
toward
beneficence
but
tell
me
of
our
country
i
tread
the
sacred
soil
where
i
received
my
being
and
i
am
ignorant
of
the
career
of
my
native
land
france
is
still
the
queen
of
the
world
is
she
not
certainly
said
leon
how
is
the
emperor
well
and
the
empress
very
well
and
the
king
of
rome
the
prince
imperial
he
is
a
very
fine
child
how
a
fine
child
and
you
have
the
face
to
say
that
this
is
nibor
took
up
the
conversation
and
explained
in
a
few
words
that
the
reigning
sovereign
of
france
was
not
napoleon
but
napoleon
iii
but
then
cried
fougas
my
emperor
is
dead
yes
impossible
tell
me
anything
you
will
but
that
my
emperor
is
immortal
nibor
and
the
renaults
who
were
not
quite
professional
historians
were
obliged
to
give
him
a
summary
of
the
history
of
our
century
some
one
went
after
a
big
book
written
by
de
norvins
and
illustrated
with
fine
engravings
by
raffet
he
only
believed
in
the
presence
of
truth
when
he
could
touch
her
with
his
hand
and
still
cried
out
almost
every
moment
that
impossible
this
is
not
history
that
you
are
reading
to
me
it
is
a
romance
written
to
make
soldiers
weep
this
young
man
must
indeed
have
had
a
strong
and
soul
for
he
learned
in
forty
minutes
all
the
woful
events
which
fortune
had
scattered
through
eighteen
years
from
the
first
abdication
up
to
the
death
of
the
king
of
rome
less
happy
than
his
old
companions
in
arms
he
had
no
interval
of
repose
between
these
terrible
and
repeated
shocks
all
beating
upon
his
heart
at
the
same
time
one
could
have
feared
that
the
blow
might
prove
mortal
and
poor
fougas
die
in
the
first
hour
of
his
recovered
life
but
the
imp
of
a
fellow
yielded
and
recovered
himself
in
quick
succession
like
a
spring
he
cried
out
with
admiration
on
hearing
of
the
five
battles
of
the
campaign
in
france
he
reddened
with
grief
at
the
farewells
of
fontainebleau
the
return
from
the
isle
of
elba
transfigured
his
handsome
and
noble
countenance
at
waterloo
his
heart
rushed
in
with
the
last
army
of
the
empire
and
there
shattered
itself
then
he
clenched
his
fists
and
said
between
his
teeth
if
i
had
been
there
at
the
head
of
the
blucher
and
wellington
would
have
seen
another
fate
the
invasion
the
truce
the
martyr
of
helena
the
ghastly
terror
of
europe
the
murder
of
murat
the
idol
of
the
cavalry
the
death
of
ney
bruno
mouton
duvernet
and
so
many
other
men
whom
he
had
known
admired
and
loved
threw
him
into
a
series
of
paroxysms
of
rage
but
nothing
upset
him
in
hearing
of
the
death
of
napoleon
he
swore
that
he
would
eat
the
heart
of
england
the
slow
agony
of
the
pale
and
interesting
heir
of
the
empire
inspired
him
with
a
passion
to
tear
the
vitals
out
of
austria
when
the
drama
was
over
and
the
curtain
fell
on
schoenbrunn
he
dashed
away
his
tears
and
said
it
is
well
i
have
lived
in
a
moment
a
man
entire
life
now
show
me
the
map
of
france
leon
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of

of

enough
of
them

had
lasted
ten
years
longer
i
could
have
had
a

for
a
when
the

was
placed
before

he
at
once
cried
out
with
profound
disdain
that

but
soon
two
tears
of
pitying
affection
escaping
from
his
eyes
swelled
the
rivers

he
kissed
the

and
said
with
an
emotion
which
communicated
itself
to
nearly
all
present
forgive
me
poor
old
love
for
insulting
your
misfortunes

scoundrels

the
convalescent
first
meal
the
messenger
whom
leon
had
sent
to
moret
could
not
reach
there
before
seven
supposing
that
he
would
find
the
ladies
at
table
with
their
hosts
that
the
great
news
would
cut
the
dinner
short
and
that
there
would
be
a
carriage
handy
clementine
and
her
aunt
would
probably
be
at
fontainebleau
between
ten
and
eleven
young
renault
rejoiced
in
advance
over
the
happiness
of
his
what
a
joy
it
would
be
for
her
and
for
him
when
he
should
present
to
her
the
miraculous
man
whom
she
had
protected
against
the
horrors
of
the
tomb
and
whom
he
had
resuscitated
in
answer
to
her
entreaty
meanwhile
gothon
proud
and
happy
to
the
same
degree
that
she
had
before
been
scandalized
and
annoyed
spread
the
table
for
a
dozen
persons
her
a
young
rustic
of
eighteen
in
the
commune
of
sablons
helped
her
with
all
his
might
and
amused
her
with
his
conversation
well
now
gothon
said
he
setting
down
a
pile
of
empty
plates
this
is
what
one
might
call
a
ghost
coming
out
of
its
box
to
upset
the
commissary
and
the
ghost
if
you
have
it
so
célestin
it
that
he
comes
from
a
good
ways
poor
young
man
but
perhaps
is
a
proper
word
to
use
in
speaking
of
our
masters
is
it
true
then
that
he
has
come
to
be
our
master
too
too
many
of
come
every
day
i
like
it
better
if
more
servants
and
help
would
come
shut
up
you
lizard
of
laziness
when
the
gentlemen
leaves
tips
for
us
on
going
away
you
do
complain
because
there
only
two
to
divide
that
all
well
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
i
carried
more
than
fifty
buckets
of
water
for
him
to
simmer
in
that
colonel
of
yours
and
i
know
mighty
well
that
he
wo
give
me
a
cent
for
he
has
a
farthing
in
his
pockets
we
got
to
believe
that
money
is
plenty
in
the
country
he
just
came
from
they
say
there
wills
in
his
favor
in
strasburg
a
gentleman
hurt
his
fortune
tell
me
now
gothon
you
who
read
a
little
book
every
sunday
where
he
could
have
been
our
colonel
while
he
was
not
in
this
world
eh
in
purgatory
of
course
then
why
do
you
ask
him
about
that
famous
baptiste
your
sweetheart
in
who
let
himself
tumble
off
a
roof
and
on
whose
account
you
have
so
many
masses
said
they
ought
to
have
met
each
other
down
there
that
very
possible
unless
baptiste
has
left
there
since
the
time
when
you
paid
so
much
money
to
get
him
out
very
well
i
go
this
very
evening
to
the
colonel
chamber
and
since
he
not
proud
he
tell
me
all
he
knows
about
but
célestin
you
never
going
to
act
different
here
you
rubbed
my
silver
pickle
knives
on
the
grindstone
again
the
guests
came
into
the
parlor
where
the
renault
family
with
nibor
and
the
colonel
were
already
assembled
there
were
successively
presented
to
fougas
the
mayor
of
the
city
doctor
martout
master
bonnivet
the
notary
audret
and
three
members
of
the
paris
committee
the
other
three
had
been
obliged
to
return
before
dinner
the
guests
were
not
entirely
at
their
ease
their
sides
bruised
by
the
first
movements
of
fougas
left
room
for
them
to
suppose
that
possibly
they
were
dining
with
a
maniac
but
curiosity
was
stronger
than
fear
the
colonel
soon
reassured
them
by
a
most
cordial
reception
he
excused
himself
for
acting
the
part
of
a
man
just
returned
from
the
other
world
he
talked
a
great
deal
a
little
too
much
perhaps
but
they
were
so
well
pleased
to
listen
to
him
and
his
words
borrowed
such
an
importance
from
the
singularity
of
recent
events
that
he
gained
an
unqualified
success
he
was
told
that
martout
had
been
one
of
the
principal
agents
of
his
resuscitation
in
conjunction
with
another
person
whom
they
promised
soon
to
present
to
him
he
thanked
martout
warmly
and
asked
how
soon
he
could
evince
his
gratitude
to
the
other
person
i
hope
said
leon
that
you
will
see
her
this
evening
no
one
came
later
than
the
colonel
of
the
of
the
line
rollon
he
made
his
way
with
no
little
difficulty
through
the
crowds
of
people
who
filled
the
rue
de
la
faisanderie
he
was
a
man
of
with
a
quick
voice
and
full
figure
his
hair
was
a
little
grizzled
but
his
brown
mustache
full
and
twisted
at
the
ends
looked
as
young
as
ever
he
said
little
spoke
to
the
point
knew
a
great
deal
and
did
no
boasting
all
in
all
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
a
colonel
he
came
right
up
to
fougas
and
held
out
his
hand
like
an
old
acquaintance
my
dear
comrade
said
he
i
have
taken
great
interest
in
your
resurrection
as
much
on
my
own
account
as
on
account
of
the
regiment
the
which
i
have
the
honor
to
command
yesterday
venerated
you
as
an
ancestor
from
it
will
cherish
you
as
a
friend
not
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
affair
of
the
morning
in
which
rollon
had
undergone
his
pummelling
with
the
rest
fougas
answered
becomingly
but
with
a
tinge
of
coldness
my
dear
comrade
i
thank
you
for
your
kindly
sentiments
it
is
singular
that
destiny
places
me
in
the
presence
of
my
successor
on
the
very
day
that
i
reopen
my
eyes
to
the
light
for
after
all
i
am
neither
dead
nor
a
general
i
have
not
been
transferred
nor
have
i
been
retired
yet
i
see
another
officer
more
worthy
doubtless
at
the
head
of
my
noble
but
if
you
have
for
your
motto
and
courage
as
i
am
well
satisfied
you
have
i
have
no
right
to
complain
and
the
regiment
is
in
good
hands
dinner
was
ready
mme
renault
took
fougas
arm
she
had
him
sit
at
her
right
and
nibor
at
her
left
the
colonel
and
the
mayor
took
their
places
at
the
sides
of
renault
the
rest
of
the
company
distributed
themselves
as
it
happened
regardless
of
etiquette
fougas
gulped
down
the
soup
and
helping
himself
to
every
dish
and
drinking
in
proportion
an
appetite
of
the
other
world
estimable
amphitryon
said
he
to
renault
do
get
frightened
at
seeing
me
fall
upon
the
rations
i
always
ate
just
so
except
during
the
retreat
in
russia
consider
too
that
i
went
to
sleep
last
night
at
liebenfeld
without
any
supper
he
begged
nibor
to
explain
to
him
by
what
course
of
circumstances
he
had
come
from
liebenfeld
to
fontainebleau
do
you
remember
said
the
doctor
an
old
german
who
acted
as
interpreter
for
you
before
the
perfectly
an
excellent
man
with
a
wig
i
remember
him
all
my
life
for
there
are
not
two
wigs
of
that
color
in
existence
very
well
it
was
the
man
with
the
violet
wig
otherwise
known
as
the
celebrated
doctor
meiser
who
saved
your
life
where
is
he
i
want
to
see
him
to
fall
into
his
arms
to
tell
him
he
was
years
old
when
he
did
you
that
little
service
he
would
then
be
in
his
hundred
and
fifteenth
year
if
he
had
waited
for
your
acknowledgments
and
so
then
he
is
no
more
death
has
robbed
him
of
my
gratitude
you
do
not
yet
know
all
that
you
owe
to
him
he
bequeathed
you
in
a
fortune
of
thousand
francs
of
which
you
are
the
rightful
owner
now
since
a
sum
invested
at
five
per
cent
doubles
itself
in
fourteen
years
thanks
to
compound
interest
you
were
worth
in
a
trifle
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
in
a
million
and
a
half
in
fine
if
you
are
satisfied
to
leave
your
property
in
the
hands
of
herr
nicholas
meiser
of
dantzic
that
worthy
man
will
owe
you
three
millions
at
the
commencement
of
that
is
to
say
in
seven
years
we
will
give
you
this
evening
a
copy
of
your
benefactor
will
it
is
a
very
instructive
document
and
you
can
consider
it
when
you
go
to
bed
i
read
it
willingly
said
colonel
fougas
but
gold
has
no
attractions
for
my
eyes
wealth
engenders
weakness
me
to
languish
in
the
sluggish
idleness
of
sybaris
to
enervate
my
senses
on
a
bed
of
roses
never
the
smell
of
powder
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
life
would
have
no
charm
or
zest
for
me
if
i
had
to
give
up
the
inspiriting
clash
of
arms
on
the
day
when
you
are
told
that
fougas
no
longer
marches
in
the
columns
of
the
army
you
can
safely
answer
is
because
fougas
is
no
more
he
turned
to
the
new
colonel
of
the
and
said
oh
do
you
my
dear
comrade
tell
them
that
the
proud
pomp
of
wealth
is
a
thousand
times
less
sweet
than
the
austere
simplicity
of
the
soldier
of
a
colonel
more
than
all
colonels
are
the
kings
of
the
army
a
colonel
is
less
than
a
general
but
nevertheless
he
has
something
more
he
lives
more
with
the
soldier
he
penetrates
further
into
the
intimacy
of
his
command
he
is
the
father
the
judge
the
friend
of
his
regiment
the
welfare
of
each
one
of
his
men
is
in
his
hands
the
flag
is
placed
under
his
tent
or
in
his
chamber
the
colonel
and
the
flag
are
not
two
separate
existences
one
is
the
soul
the
other
is
the
body
he
asked
rollon
permission
to
go
to
see
and
embrace
the
flag
of
the
you
shall
see
it
morning
said
the
new
colonel
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
breakfast
with
me
in
company
with
some
of
my
officers
he
accepted
the
invitation
with
enthusiasm
and
flung
himself
into
the
midst
of
a
thousand
questions
touching
pay
the
amount
retained
for
clothing
promotion
roster
reserve
uniform
full
and
fatigue
dress
armament
and
tactics
he
understood
without
difficulty
the
advantages
of
the
percussion
gun
but
the
attempt
to
explain
rifled
cannon
to
him
was
in
vain
artillery
was
not
his
forte
but
he
avowed
nevertheless
that
napoleon
had
owed
more
than
one
victory
to
his
fine
artillery
while
the
innumerable
roasts
of
mme
renault
were
succeeding
each
other
on
the
table
fougas
asked
but
without
ever
losing
a
bite
what
were
the
principal
wars
in
progress
how
many
nations
france
had
on
her
hands
and
if
it
was
not
intended
ultimately
to
recommence
the
conquest
of
the
world
the
answers
which
he
received
without
completely
satisfying
him
did
not
entirely
deprive
him
of
hope
i
did
well
to
come
said
he
there
work
to
do
the
african
wars
did
not
interest
him
much
although
in
them
the
had
won
a
good
share
of
glory
as
a
school
it
very
well
said
he
the
soldier
ought
to
train
himself
in
other
ways
than
in
the
tivoli
gardens
behind
petticoats
but
why
the
devil
are
not
five
hundred
thousand
men
flung
upon
the
back
of
england
england
is
the
soul
of
the
coalition
i
can
tell
you
that
how
many
explanations
were
necessary
to
make
him
understand
the
crimean
war
where
the
english
had
fought
by
our
sides
i
can
understand
said
he
why
we
took
a
crack
at
the
russians
they
made
me
eat
my
best
horse
but
the
english
are
a
thousand
times
worse
if
this
young
man
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
does
know
it
tell
him
there
is
no
quarter
possible
after
what
they
did
at
helena
if
i
had
been
in
the
crimea
i
would
have
begun
by
properly
squelching
the
russians
after
which
i
would
have
turned
upon
the
english
and
hurled
them
into
the
sea
it
their
element
anyhow
they
gave
him
some
details
of
the
italian
campaign
and
he
was
charmed
to
learn
that
the
had
taken
a
redoubt
under
the
eyes
of
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
that
the
habit
of
the
regiment
said
he
shedding
tears
in
his
napkin
that
brigand
of
a
will
never
act
in
any
other
way
the
goddess
of
victory
has
touched
it
with
her
wing
one
of
the
things
for
example
which
greatly
astonished
him
was
that
a
war
of
such
importance
was
finished
up
in
so
short
a
time
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
within
a
few
years
the
world
had
learned
the
secret
of
transporting
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
four
days
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
good
said
he
i
admit
the
practicability
of
it
but
what
astonishes
me
is
that
the
emperor
did
not
invent
this
affair
in
for
he
had
a
genius
for
transportation
a
genius
for
administration
a
genius
for
office
details
a
genius
for
everything
but
to
resume
your
story
the
austrians
are
fortified
at
last
and
you
can
not
possibly
get
to
vienna
in
less
than
three
months
we
did
not
go
so
far
in
fact
you
did
not
push
on
to
vienna
no
well
then
where
did
you
sign
the
treaty
of
peace
at
villafranca
at
villafranca
that
the
capital
of
austria
then
no
it
a
village
of
italy
monsieur
i
do
admit
that
treaties
of
peace
are
signed
anywhere
but
in
capitals
that
was
our
principle
our
a
b
c
the
first
paragraph
of
our
theory
it
seems
as
if
the
world
must
have
changed
a
good
deal
while
i
was
not
in
it
but
patience
and
now
truth
obliges
me
to
confess
that
fougas
got
drunk
at
dessert
he
had
drunk
and
eaten
like
a
homeric
hero
and
talked
more
fluently
than
cicero
in
his
best
days
the
fumes
of
wine
spices
and
eloquence
mounted
into
his
brain
he
became
familiar
spoke
affectionately
to
some
and
rudely
to
others
and
poured
out
a
torrent
of
absurdities
big
enough
to
turn
forty
mills
his
drunkenness
however
had
in
it
nothing
brutal
or
even
ignoble
it
was
but
the
overflowing
of
a
spirit
young
affectionate
and
unbalanced
he
proposed
five
or
six
toasts
to
glory
to
the
extension
of
our
frontiers
to
the
destruction
of
the
last
of
the
english
to
mlle
mars
the
hope
of
the
french
stage
to
affection
the
tie
fragile
but
dear
which
unites
the
lover
to
his
sweetheart
the
father
to
his
son
the
colonel
to
his
regiment
his
style
a
singular
mixture
of
familiarity
and
impressiveness
provoked
more
than
one
smile
among
the
auditory
he
noticed
it
and
a
spark
of
defiance
flashed
up
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
from
time
to
time
he
loudly
asked
if
those
people
there
were
not
abusing
his
ingenuousness
confusion
cried
he
confusion
to
those
who
want
me
to
take
bladders
for
lanterns
the
lantern
may
blaze
out
like
a
bomb
and
carry
consternation
in
its
path
after
a
series
of
such
remarks
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
roll
under
the
table
and
this
was
generally
expected
but
the
colonel
belonged
to
a
robust
generation
accustomed
to
more
than
one
kind
of
excess
and
strong
to
resist
pleasure
as
well
as
dangers
privations
and
fatigues
so
when
madame
renault
pushed
back
her
chair
in
indication
that
the
repast
was
finished
fougas
arose
without
difficulty
gracefully
offered
his
arm
and
conducted
his
partner
to
the
parlor
his
gait
was
a
little
stiff
and
oppressively
regular
but
he
went
straight
ahead
and
did
not
oscillate
the
least
bit
he
took
a
couple
of
cups
of
coffee
and
spirits
in
moderation
after
which
he
began
to
talk
in
the
most
reasonable
manner
in
the
world
about
ten
martout
having
expressed
a
wish
to
hear
his
history
he
placed
himself
on
a
stool
collected
his
ideas
for
a
moment
and
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
and
sugar
the
company
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
around
him
and
he
commenced
the
following
narrative
the
slightly
antiquated
style
of
which
craves
your
indulgence
chapter
xiii
history
of
colonel
fougas
related
by
himself
do
not
expect
that
i
will
ornament
my
story
with
those
flowers
more
agreeable
than
substantial
which
imagination
often
uses
to
gloss
over
truth
a
frenchman
and
a
soldier
i
doubly
ignore
deception
friendship
interrogates
me
frankness
shall
answer
i
was
born
of
poor
but
honest
parents
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
which
the
de
brightened
with
an
aurora
of
liberty
the
south
was
my
native
clime
the
language
dear
to
the
troubadours
was
that
which
i
lisped
in
my
cradle
my
birth
cost
my
mother
life
the
author
of
mine
was
the
humble
owner
of
a
little
farm
and
moistened
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
labor
my
first
sports
were
not
those
of
wealth
the
pebbles
which
are
found
by
the
brooks
and
that
insect
which
childhood
holds
fluttering
free
and
captive
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
a
thread
stood
me
in
stead
of
other
playthings
an
old
minister
at
devotion
altar
enfranchised
from
the
shadowy
bondage
of
fanaticism
and
reconciled
to
the
new
institutions
of
france
was
my
chiron
and
mentor
he
nourished
me
with
the
strong
lion
marrow
of
rome
and
athens
his
lips
distilled
into
my
ears
the
embalmed
honey
of
wisdom
honor
to
thee
learned
and
venerable
man
who
gavest
me
the
first
precepts
of
wisdom
and
the
first
examples
of
virtue
but
already
that
atmosphere
of
glory
which
the
genius
of
one
man
and
the
valor
of
a
nation
had
set
floating
over
the
country
filled
all
my
senses
and
made
my
young
heart
throb
france
on
the
edge
of
the
volcano
of
civil
war
had
collected
all
her
forces
into
a
thunderbolt
to
launch
upon
europe
and
the
world
astounded
if
not
overwhelmed
was
shrinking
from
the
surge
of
the
unchained
torrent
what
man
what
frenchman
could
have
heard
with
indifference
that
echo
of
victory
reverberating
through
millions
of
hearts
while
scarcely
leaving
childhood
i
felt
that
honor
is
more
precious
than
life
the
warlike
music
of
the
drums
brought
to
my
eyes
brave
and
manly
tears
i
too
said
i
following
the
music
of
the
regiments
through
the
streets
of
toulouse
pluck
laurels
though
i
sprinkle
them
with
my
blood
the
pale
olive
of
peace
had
from
me
nothing
but
scorn
the
peaceful
triumphs
of
the
law
the
calm
pleasures
of
commerce
and
finance
were
extolled
in
vain
to
the
toga
of
our
ciceros
to
the
robe
of
our
magistrates
to
the
curule
chair
of
our
legislators
to
the
opulence
of
our
mondors
i
preferred
the
sword
one
would
have
said
that
i
had
sucked
the
milk
of
bellona
or
death
was
already
my
motto
and
i
was
not
sixteen
years
old
with
what
noble
scorn
i
heard
recounted
the
history
of
our
proteuses
of
politics
with
what
disdainful
glances
i
regarded
the
turcarets
of
finance
lolling
on
the
cushions
of
some
magnificent
carriage
and
conducted
by
a
laced
automaton
to
the
boudoir
of
some
aspasia
but
if
i
heard
told
the
mighty
deeds
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
or
the
valor
of
the
crusaders
celebrated
in
flowing
verse
if
chance
placed
in
my
hand
the
great
actions
of
our
modern
rolands
recounted
in
an
army
bulletin
by
the
successor
of
charlemagne
a
flame
presaging
the
fire
of
battles
rose
in
my
young
eyes
ah
the
inaction
was
too
much
and
my
already
worn
by
impatience
would
have
broken
perhaps
had
not
a
father
wisdom
untied
them
surely
said
he
to
me
trying
but
in
vain
to
restrain
his
tears
was
no
tyrant
who
begot
you
and
i
will
not
poison
the
life
which
i
myself
gave
you
i
had
hoped
that
your
hand
would
remain
in
our
cottage
to
close
my
eyes
but
when
patriotism
has
spoken
egotism
must
be
still
my
prayers
will
always
follow
you
to
the
field
where
mars
harvests
heroes
may
you
merit
the
guerdon
of
valor
and
show
yourself
a
good
citizen
as
you
have
been
a
good
son
speaking
thus
he
opened
his
arms
to
me
i
threw
myself
into
them
we
mingled
our
tears
and
i
promised
to
return
to
our
hearthstone
as
soon
as
i
could
bring
the
star
of
honor
suspended
from
my
breast
but
alas
my
unhappy
father
was
destined
to
see
me
no
more
the
fate
which
was
already
gilding
the
thread
of
my
days
pitilessly
severed
that
of
his
a
stranger
hand
closed
his
eyes
while
i
was
gaining
my
first
epaulette
at
the
battle
of
jena
lieutenant
at
eylau
captain
at
wagram
and
there
decorated
by
the
emperor
own
hand
on
the
field
of
battle
major
before
almieda
at
badajoz
colonel
at
moscow
i
have
drunk
the
cup
of
victory
to
the
full
but
i
have
also
tasted
the
chalice
of
adversity
the
frozen
plains
of
russia
saw
me
alone
with
a
platoon
of
braves
the
last
remnant
of
my
regiment
forced
to
devour
the
mortal
remains
of
that
faithful
friend
who
had
so
often
carried
me
into
the
very
heart
of
the
enemy
battalions
trusty
and
affectionate
companion
of
my
dangers
when
rendered
useless
by
an
accident
at
smolensk
he
devoted
his
very
to
the
safety
of
his
master
and
made
of
his
skin
a
protection
for
my
frozen
and
lacerated
feet
my
tongue
refuses
to
repeat
the
story
of
our
perils
in
that
terrible
campaign
perhaps
some
day
i
will
write
it
with
a
pen
dipped
in
tears
tears
the
tribute
of
feeble
humanity
surprised
by
the
season
of
frosts
in
a
zone
of
ice
without
fire
without
bread
without
shoes
without
means
of
transportation
denied
the
succor
of
esculapius
art
harassed
by
the
cossacks
robbed
by
the
peasants
positive
vampires
we
saw
our
mute
thunderers
which
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
belch
forth
death
upon
ourselves
what
more
can
i
tell
you
the
passage
of
the
beresina
the
opposition
at
wilna
oh
ye
gods
of
thunder
but
i
feel
that
grief
overcomes
me
and
that
my
language
is
becoming
tinged
with
the
bitterness
of
these
recollections
nature
and
love
were
holding
in
reserve
for
me
brief
but
precious
consolations
released
from
my
fatigues
i
passed
a
few
happy
days
in
my
native
land
among
the
peaceful
vales
of
nancy
while
our
phalanxes
were
preparing
themselves
for
fresh
combats
while
i
was
gathering
around
my
flag
three
thousand
young
but
valorous
warriors
all
resolved
to
open
to
posterity
the
path
of
honor
a
new
emotion
to
which
i
had
before
been
a
stranger
furtively
glided
into
my
soul
beautified
by
all
nature
gifts
enriched
by
the
fruits
of
an
excellent
education
the
young
and
interesting
clementine
had
scarcely
passed
from
the
uncertain
shadows
of
childhood
into
the
sweet
illusions
of
youth
eighteen
springs
composed
her
life
her
parents
extended
to
some
of
the
army
officers
a
hospitality
which
though
it
was
not
gratuitous
was
far
from
lacking
in
cordiality
to
see
their
child
and
love
her
was
for
me
the
affair
of
a
day
her
virgin
heart
smiled
upon
my
love
at
the
first
avowals
dictated
to
me
by
my
passion
i
saw
her
forehead
color
with
a
lovely
modesty
we
exchanged
our
vows
one
lovely
evening
in
june
under
an
arbor
where
her
happy
father
sometimes
dispensed
to
the
thirsty
officers
the
brown
liquor
of
the
north
i
swore
that
she
should
be
my
wife
and
she
promised
to
be
mine
she
yielded
still
more
our
happiness
regardless
of
all
outside
had
the
calmness
of
a
brook
whose
pure
wave
is
never
troubled
by
the
storm
and
which
rolls
sweetly
between
flowery
banks
spreading
its
own
freshness
through
the
grove
that
protects
its
modest
course
a
lightning
stroke
separated
us
from
each
other
at
the
moment
when
law
and
religion
were
about
adding
their
sanction
to
our
sweet
communion
i
departed
before
i
was
able
to
give
my
name
to
her
who
had
given
me
her
heart
i
promised
to
return
she
promised
to
wait
for
me
and
all
bathed
in
her
tears
i
tore
myself
from
her
arms
to
rush
to
the
laurels
of
dresden
and
the
cypresses
of
leipzic
a
few
lines
from
her
hand
reached
me
during
the
interval
between
the
two
battles
are
to
be
a
father
she
told
me
am
i
one
god
knows
has
she
waited
for
me
i
believe
she
has
the
waiting
must
have
appeared
to
be
a
long
one
since
the
birth
of
this
child
who
is
years
old
and
who
could
be
in
his
turn
my
father
pardon
me
for
having
troubled
you
so
long
with
misfortunes
i
wished
to
pass
rapidly
over
this
sad
history
but
the
unhappiness
of
virtue
has
in
it
something
sweet
to
temper
the
bitterness
of
grief
some
days
after
the
disaster
of
leipzic
the
giant
of
our
age
had
me
called
into
his
tent
and
said
to
me
are
you
a
man
to
make
your
way
through
four
armies
sire
and
without
escort
sire
must
be
a
letter
carried
to
dantzic
sire
will
deliver
it
into
general
rapp
own
hands
sire
is
probable
you
will
be
taken
or
killed
sire
that
reason
i
send
two
other
officers
with
copies
of
the
same
despatch
there
are
three
of
you
the
enemy
will
kill
two
the
third
will
get
there
and
france
will
be
saved
sire
one
who
returns
shall
be
a
sire
every
detail
of
this
interview
every
word
of
the
emperor
every
response
which
i
had
the
honor
to
address
to
him
is
still
engraved
upon
my
memory
all
three
of
us
set
out
separately
alas
not
one
of
us
reached
the
goal
aimed
at
by
his
valor
and
i
have
learned
that
france
was
not
saved
but
when
i
see
these
blockheads
of
historians
asserting
that
the
emperor
forgot
to
send
orders
to
general
rapp
i
feel
a
terrible
itching
to
cut
their
story
short
at
least
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
russians
in
a
german
village
i
had
the
consolation
of
finding
an
old
philosopher
who
gave
me
the
rarest
proofs
of
friendship
who
would
have
told
me
when
i
succumbed
to
the
numbness
of
the
cold
in
the
tower
of
liebenfeld
that
that
sleep
would
not
be
the
last
god
is
my
witness
that
in
then
addressing
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
a
last
farewell
to
clementine
i
did
not
even
hope
to
see
her
again
i
will
see
you
again
then
o
sweet
and
confiding
clementine
best
of
spouses
and
probably
of
mothers
what
do
i
say
i
see
her
now
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
this
is
surely
she
there
she
is
just
as
i
left
her
clementine
in
my
arms
on
my
heart
look
here
what
this
you
been
whining
to
me
the
rest
of
you
napoleon
is
not
dead
and
the
world
has
not
grown
years
older
for
clementine
is
still
the
same
the
betrothed
of
leon
renault
was
about
entering
the
room
and
stopped
petrified
at
finding
herself
so
overwhelmingly
received
by
the
colonel
chapter
xiv
the
game
of
love
and
war
as
she
was
evidently
backward
in
falling
into
his
arms
fougas
imitated
mahomet
and
ran
to
the
mountain
oh
clementine
said
he
covering
her
with
kisses
the
friendly
fates
give
you
back
to
my
devotion
i
clasp
once
more
the
partner
of
my
life
and
the
mother
of
my
child
the
young
lady
was
so
astounded
that
she
did
not
even
dream
of
defending
herself
happily
leon
renault
extricated
her
from
the
hands
of
the
colonel
and
placed
himself
between
them
determined
to
defend
his
own
monsieur
cried
he
clenching
his
fists
you
deceive
yourself
entirely
if
you
think
you
know
she
is
not
a
person
of
your
time
but
of
ours
she
is
not
your
but
mine
she
has
never
been
the
mother
of
your
child
and
i
trust
that
she
will
be
the
mother
of
mine
fougas
was
iron
he
seized
his
rival
by
the
arm
sent
him
off
spinning
like
a
top
and
put
himself
face
to
face
with
the
young
girl
are
you
clementine
he
demanded
of
her
yes
monsieur
i
call
you
all
to
witness
that
she
is
my
clementine
leon
returned
to
the
charge
and
seized
the
colonel
by
the
collar
at
the
risk
of
getting
himself
dashed
against
the
walls
we
had
joking
enough
said
he
possibly
you
do
pretend
to
monopolize
all
the
clementines
in
the
world
mademoiselle
name
is
clementine
sambucco
she
was
born
at
martinique
where
you
never
set
your
foot
if
i
am
to
believe
what
you
have
said
within
an
hour
she
is
eighteen
years
old
so
was
the
other
eh
the
other
is
since
she
was
eighteen
in
mlle
sambucco
is
of
an
honorable
and
family
her
father
sambucco
was
a
magistrate
her
grandfather
was
a
functionary
of
the
war
department
you
see
she
is
in
no
way
connected
with
you
nearly
or
remotely
and
good
sense
and
politeness
to
say
nothing
of
gratitude
make
it
your
duty
to
leave
her
in
peace
he
gave
the
colonel
a
shove
in
his
turn
and
made
him
tumble
between
the
arms
of
a
sofa
fougas
bounded
up
as
if
he
had
been
thrown
on
a
million
springs
but
clementine
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
and
a
smile
monsieur
said
she
in
her
most
caressing
voice
do
not
get
angry
with
him
he
loves
me
so
much
the
more
reason
why
i
should
damnation
he
cooled
down
nevertheless
made
the
young
lady
sit
down
beside
him
and
regarded
her
from
head
to
foot
with
the
most
absorbed
attention
this
is
surely
she
said
he
my
memory
my
eyes
my
heart
everything
in
me
recognizes
her
and
tells
me
that
it
is
she
and
nevertheless
the
testimony
of
mankind
the
calculation
of
times
and
distances
in
a
word
the
very
soul
of
evidence
seems
to
have
made
it
a
special
point
to
convict
me
of
error
is
it
possible
then
that
two
women
should
so
resemble
each
other
am
i
the
victim
of
an
illusion
of
the
senses
have
i
recovered
life
only
to
lose
reason
no
i
know
myself
i
find
myself
the
same
my
judgment
is
firm
and
accurate
and
can
make
its
way
in
this
world
so
new
and
it
is
on
but
one
point
that
my
reason
wavers
clementine
i
seem
to
see
you
again
and
you
are
not
you
well
what
the
difference
after
all
if
the
destiny
which
snatched
me
from
the
tomb
has
taken
care
to
present
to
my
awaking
sense
the
image
of
her
i
loved
it
must
be
because
it
had
resolved
to
give
me
back
one
after
another
all
the
blessings
which
i
had
lost
in
a
few
days
my
epaulettes
the
flag
of
the
of
the
line
this
adorable
presence
which
made
my
heart
beat
for
the
first
time
living
image
of
all
that
is
sweetest
and
clearest
in
the
past
i
throw
myself
at
your
feet
be
my
wife
the
devil
of
a
fellow
joined
the
deed
to
the
word
and
the
witnesses
of
the
unexpected
scene
opened
their
eyes
to
the
widest
but
aunt
the
austere
mlle
sambucco
thought
that
it
was
time
to
show
her
authority
she
stretched
out
her
big
wrinkled
hands
seized
fougas
jerked
him
sharply
to
his
feet
and
cried
in
her
shrillest
voice
enough
sir
it
is
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
scandalous
farce
my
niece
is
not
for
you
i
have
promised
her
and
given
her
away
know
that
day
after
the
of
this
month
at
ten
in
the
morning
she
will
marry
leon
renault
your
benefactor
and
i
forbid
it
do
you
hear
madame
aunt
and
if
she
pretends
to
marry
this
boy
what
will
you
do
i
curse
her
leon
could
not
help
laughing
the
malediction
of
this
colonel
appeared
rather
more
comic
than
terrible
but
clementine
grew
pale
burst
into
tears
and
fell
in
her
turn
at
the
feet
of
fougas
monsieur
cried
she
kissing
his
hands
do
not
overwhelm
a
poor
girl
who
venerates
you
who
loves
you
who
will
sacrifice
her
happiness
if
you
demand
it
by
all
the
marks
of
tenderness
which
i
have
lavished
upon
you
for
a
month
by
the
tears
i
have
poured
upon
your
coffin
by
the
respectful
zeal
with
which
i
have
urged
on
your
resuscitation
i
conjure
you
to
pardon
our
offences
i
will
not
marry
leon
if
you
forbid
me
i
will
do
anything
to
please
you
i
will
obey
you
in
everything
but
for
god
sake
do
not
pour
upon
me
your
maledictions
embrace
me
said
fougas
you
yield
i
pardon
clementine
raised
herself
all
radiant
with
joy
and
held
up
her
beautiful
forehead
the
stupefaction
of
the
spectators
especially
of
those
most
interested
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
an
old
mummy
dictating
laws
breaking
off
marriages
and
imposing
his
desires
on
the
whole
house
pretty
little
clementine
so
reasonable
so
obedient
so
happy
in
the
prospect
of
marrying
leon
renault
sacrificing
all
at
once
her
affections
her
happiness
and
almost
her
duty
to
the
caprice
of
an
interloper
nibor
declared
that
it
was
madness
as
for
leon
he
would
have
butted
his
head
into
all
the
walls
if
his
mother
had
not
held
him
back
ah
my
poor
child
said
she
why
did
you
bring
that
thing
from
berlin
it
my
fault
cried
old
monsieur
renault
no
interrupted
martout
it
mine
the
members
of
the
parisian
committee
discussed
with
rollon
the
new
aspect
of
the
case
had
they
resuscitated
a
madman
had
the
revivification
produced
some
disorder
of
the
nervous
system
had
the
abuse
of
wine
and
other
drinkables
during
the
first
repast
caused
a
delirium
what
an
interesting
autopsy
it
would
be
if
they
could
dissect
fougas
at
the
next
regular
meeting
you
would
do
very
well
as
far
as
you
would
go
gentlemen
said
the
colonel
of
the
the
autopsy
might
explain
the
delirium
of
our
unfortunate
friend
but
it
would
not
account
for
the
impression
produced
upon
the
young
lady
is
it
fascination
magnetism
or
what
while
the
friends
and
relations
were
weeping
counselling
and
buzzing
around
him
fougas
serene
and
smiling
gazed
at
himself
in
eyes
while
they
too
regarded
him
tenderly
this
must
be
brought
to
an
end
cried
mlle
sambucco
the
severe
come
clementine
fougas
seemed
surprised
she
does
live
here
then
no
sir
she
lives
with
me
then
i
will
escort
her
home
angel
will
you
take
my
arm
oh
yes
monsieur
with
great
pleasure
leon
gnashed
his
teeth
this
is
admirable
he
presumes
on
such
familiarity
and
she
takes
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
he
went
to
get
his
hat
for
the
purpose
of
at
least
going
home
with
the
aunt
but
his
hat
was
not
in
its
place
fougas
who
had
not
yet
one
of
his
own
had
helped
himself
to
it
without
ceremony
the
poor
lover
crowded
his
head
into
a
cap
and
followed
fougas
and
clementine
with
the
respectable
virginie
whose
arm
cut
like
a
scythe
by
an
accident
which
happened
almost
daily
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
met
clementine
on
the
way
home
the
young
lady
directed
attention
to
him
that
du
marnet
said
she
his
restaurant
is
at
the
end
of
our
street
and
his
room
at
the
side
of
the
park
i
think
he
is
very
much
taken
with
my
little
self
but
he
has
never
even
bowed
to
me
the
only
man
for
whom
my
heart
has
ever
beaten
is
leon
renault
ah
indeed
and
me
said
fougas
oh
as
for
you
that
another
matter
i
respect
you
and
stand
in
awe
of
you
it
seems
to
me
as
if
you
were
a
good
and
respectable
parent
thank
you
i
telling
you
the
truth
as
far
as
i
can
read
it
in
my
heart
all
this
is
not
very
clear
i
confess
but
i
do
not
understand
myself
azure
flower
of
innocence
i
adore
your
sweet
perplexity
let
love
take
care
of
itself
it
will
speak
to
you
in
master
tones
i
do
know
anything
about
that
it
possible
here
we
are
at
home
good
evening
monsieur
embrace
good
night
leon
do
quarrel
with
fougas
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
love
you
in
a
different
way
the
aunt
virginie
made
no
response
to
the
good
evening
of
fougas
when
the
two
men
were
alone
in
the
street
leon
marched
along
without
saying
a
word
till
they
reached
the
next
there
planting
himself
resolutely
opposite
the
colonel
he
said
well
sir
now
that
we
are
alone
we
had
better
have
an
explanation
i
do
know
by
what
philter
or
incantation
you
have
obtained
such
prodigious
influence
over
my
betrothed
but
i
know
that
i
love
her
that
i
have
been
loved
by
her
more
than
four
years
and
that
i
will
not
stop
at
any
means
of
retaining
and
protecting
her
friend
answered
fougas
you
can
brave
me
with
impunity
my
arm
is
chained
by
gratitude
it
shall
never
be
written
in
history
that
pierre
fougas
was
an
ingrate
would
it
have
been
more
ungrateful
in
you
to
cut
my
throat
than
to
rob
me
of
my
wife
oh
my
benefactor
learn
to
understand
and
pardon
god
forbid
that
i
should
marry
clementine
in
spite
of
you
in
spite
of
herself
it
is
through
her
consent
and
your
own
that
i
hope
to
win
her
realize
that
she
has
been
dear
to
me
not
for
four
years
as
to
you
but
for
nearly
half
a
century
reflect
that
i
am
alone
on
earth
and
that
her
sweet
face
is
my
only
consolation
will
you
who
have
given
me
life
prevent
my
spending
it
happily
have
you
called
me
back
to
the
world
only
to
deliver
me
over
to
despair
tiger
take
back
then
the
life
you
gave
me
if
you
will
not
permit
me
to
consecrate
it
to
the
adorable
clementine
upon
my
soul
my
dear
fellow
you
are
superb
the
habit
of
victory
must
have
totally
twisted
your
wits
my
hat
is
on
your
head
keep
it
so
far
so
good
but
because
my
betrothed
happens
to
remind
you
vaguely
of
a
girl
in
nancy
must
i
give
her
up
to
you
i
ca
see
it
friend
i
will
give
you
back
your
hat
just
as
soon
as
you
bought
me
another
one
but
do
not
ask
me
to
give
up
clementine
in
the
first
place
do
you
know
that
she
will
reject
me
i
sure
of
it
she
loves
me
you
crazy
you
seen
her
at
my
feet
what
of
that
it
was
from
fear
from
respect
from
superstition
from
anything
in
the
devil
name
you
choose
to
call
it
but
it
was
not
from
love
we
see
about
that
pretty
clearly
after
six
months
of
married
life
but
cried
leon
renault
have
you
the
right
to
dispose
of
yourself
there
is
another
clementine
the
true
one
she
has
sacrificed
everything
for
you
you
are
engaged
in
honor
to
her
is
colonel
fougas
deaf
to
the
voice
of
honor
are
you
mocking
me
what
i
marry
a
woman
years
old
you
ought
to
if
not
for
her
sake
at
least
for
your
child
my
child
is
a
pretty
big
boy
he
years
old
he
has
no
further
need
of
my
care
he
does
need
your
name
though
i
adopt
him
the
law
is
opposed
to
it
you
not
fifty
years
old
and
he
not
fifteen
years
younger
than
you
are
quite
the
reverse
very
well
i
legitimize
him
by
marrying
the
young
clementine
how
can
you
expect
her
to
acknowledge
a
child
twice
as
old
as
she
is
herself
but
then
i
ca
acknowledge
him
any
better
so
there
no
need
of
my
marrying
the
old
woman
moreover
i
be
excessively
accommodating
to
break
my
head
for
a
child
who
is
very
likely
dead
what
do
i
say
it
is
possible
that
he
never
saw
the
light
i
love
and
am
loved
that
much
is
substantial
and
certain
and
you
shall
be
my
groomsman
not
yet
awhile
mlle
sambucco
is
a
minor
and
her
guardian
is
my
father
your
father
is
an
honorable
man
and
he
will
not
have
the
baseness
to
refuse
her
to
me
at
least
he
will
ask
you
if
you
have
any
position
any
rank
any
fortune
to
offer
to
his
ward
my
position
colonel
my
rank
colonel
my
fortune
the
pay
of
a
colonel
and
the
millions
at
dantzic
i
must
forget
them
here
we
are
at
home
let
me
have
the
will
of
that
good
old
gentleman
who
wore
the
lilac
wig
give
me
some
books
on
history
too
a
big
pile
of
them
all
that
have
anything
to
say
about
napoleon
young
renault
sadly
obeyed
the
master
he
had
given
himself
he
conducted
fougas
to
a
fine
chamber
brought
him
herr
meiser
will
and
a
whole
shelf
of
books
and
bid
his
mortal
enemy
good
night
the
colonel
embraced
him
impetuously
and
said
to
him
i
will
never
forget
that
to
you
i
owe
life
and
clementine
farewell
till
noble
and
generous
child
of
my
native
land
farewell
leon
went
back
to
the
ground
floor
passed
the
where
gothon
was
wiping
the
glasses
and
putting
the
silver
in
order
and
rejoined
his
father
and
mother
who
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
parlor
the
guests
were
gone
the
candles
extinguished
a
single
lamp
lit
up
the
solitude
the
two
mandarins
on
the
étagère
were
motionless
in
their
obscure
corner
and
seemed
to
meditate
gravely
on
the
caprices
of
fortune
well
demanded
mme
renault
i
left
him
in
his
room
crazier
and
more
obstinate
than
ever
however
i
got
an
idea
so
much
the
better
said
the
father
for
we
have
none
left
sadness
has
made
us
stupid
but
above
all
things
no
quarrelling
these
soldiers
of
the
empire
used
to
be
terrible
swordsmen
oh
i
not
afraid
of
him
it
clementine
that
makes
me
anxious
with
what
sweetness
and
submission
she
listened
to
the
confounded
babbler
the
heart
of
woman
is
an
unfathomable
abyss
well
what
do
you
think
of
doing
leon
developed
in
detail
the
project
he
had
conceived
in
the
street
during
his
conversation
with
fougas
the
most
urgent
thing
said
he
is
to
relieve
clementine
from
this
influence
if
we
could
get
him
out
of
the
way
reason
would
resume
its
empire
and
we
would
be
married
the
day
after
that
being
done
i
answer
for
the
rest
but
how
is
such
a
madman
to
be
gotten
rid
of
i
see
but
one
way
but
it
is
almost
infallible
to
excite
his
dominant
passion
these
fellows
sometimes
imagine
that
they
are
in
love
but
at
the
bottom
they
love
nothing
but
powder
the
thing
is
to
fling
fougas
back
into
the
current
of
military
ideas
his
breakfast
with
the
colonel
of
the
will
be
a
good
preparation
i
made
him
understand
that
he
ought
before
all
to
reclaim
his
rank
and
epaulettes
and
he
has
become
inoculated
with
the
idea
he
go
to
paris
then
possibly
he
find
there
some
of
his
acquaintance
at
all
events
he
reënter
the
service
the
occupations
incident
to
his
position
will
be
a
powerful
diversion
he
no
longer
dream
of
clementine
whom
i
will
have
fixed
securely
we
will
have
to
furnish
him
the
wherewithal
to
knock
about
the
world
but
all
sacrifices
of
money
are
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
happiness
i
wish
to
save
madame
renault
who
was
a
woman
of
thrift
blamed
her
son
generosity
a
little
the
colonel
is
an
ungrateful
soul
said
she
we
already
done
too
much
in
giving
him
back
his
life
let
him
take
care
of
himself
now
no
said
the
father
we
not
the
right
to
send
him
forth
entirely
decency
forbids
this
deliberation
which
had
lasted
a
good
hour
and
a
quarter
was
interrupted
by
a
tremendous
racket
one
would
have
declared
that
the
house
was
falling
down
there
he
is
again
cried
leon
undoubtedly
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
raving
madness
he
ran
followed
by
his
parents
and
mounted
the
steps
four
at
a
time
a
candle
was
burning
at
the
sill
of
the
chamber
door
leon
took
it
and
pushed
the
door
half
open
must
it
be
confessed
hope
and
joy
spoke
louder
to
him
than
fear
he
fancied
himself
already
relieved
of
the
colonel
but
the
spectacle
presented
to
his
eyes
suddenly
diverted
the
course
of
his
ideas
and
the
inconsolable
lover
began
laughing
like
a
fool
a
noise
of
kicks
blows
and
slaps
an
undefined
group
rolling
on
the
floor
in
the
convulsions
of
a
desperate
struggle
so
much
was
all
he
could
see
and
understand
at
the
first
glance
soon
fougas
lit
up
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
candle
discovered
that
he
was
struggling
with
gothon
like
jacob
with
the
angel
and
went
back
confused
and
pitiable
to
bed
the
colonel
had
gone
to
sleep
over
the
history
of
napoleon
without
putting
out
the
candle
gothon
after
finishing
her
work
saw
the
light
under
the
door
her
thoughts
recurred
to
that
poor
baptiste
who
perhaps
was
groaning
in
purgatory
for
having
let
himself
tumble
from
a
roof
hoping
that
fougas
could
give
her
some
news
of
her
lover
she
rapped
several
times
at
first
softly
then
much
louder
the
silence
and
the
lighted
candle
made
it
seem
to
the
servant
that
there
was
something
wrong
the
fire
might
catch
the
curtains
and
from
thence
the
whole
building
she
accordingly
set
down
the
candle
opened
the
door
and
went
with
steps
to
put
out
the
light
possibly
the
eyes
of
the
sleeper
vaguely
perceived
the
passage
of
a
shadow
possibly
gothon
with
her
big
awkward
figure
made
a
board
in
the
floor
creak
fougas
partially
awoke
heard
the
rustling
of
a
dress
dreamed
it
one
of
those
adventures
which
were
wont
to
spice
garrison
life
under
the
first
empire
and
held
out
his
arms
blindly
calling
clementine
gothon
on
finding
herself
seized
by
the
hair
and
shoulders
responded
by
such
a
masculine
blow
that
the
enemy
supposed
himself
attacked
by
a
man
the
blow
was
returned
with
interest
further
exchanges
followed
and
they
finished
by
clinching
and
rolling
on
the
floor
if
anybody
ever
did
feel
shamefaced
fougas
was
certainly
the
man
gothon
went
to
bed
considerably
bruised
the
renault
family
talked
sense
into
the
colonel
and
got
out
of
him
pretty
much
what
they
wanted
he
promised
to
set
out
next
day
accepted
as
a
loan
the
money
offered
him
and
swore
not
to
return
until
he
should
have
recovered
his
epaulettes
and
secured
the
dantzic
bequest
and
then
said
he
i
marry
clementine
on
that
point
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
the
idea
was
fixed
everybody
slept
soundly
in
the
mansion
of
the
renaults
the
heads
of
the
house
because
they
had
had
three
sleepless
nights
fougas
and
gothon
because
each
had
been
unmercifully
pummelled
and
the
young
célestin
because
he
had
drunk
the
heeltaps
from
all
the
glasses
the
next
morning
rollon
came
to
know
if
fougas
were
in
a
condition
to
breakfast
with
him
he
feared
just
the
least
bit
that
he
would
find
him
under
a
shower
bath
far
from
it
the
madman
of
yesterday
was
as
calm
as
a
picture
and
as
fresh
as
a
rosebud
he
shaved
with
razors
while
humming
an
air
of
nicolo
with
his
hosts
he
was
charming
and
he
promised
to
settle
a
pension
on
gothon
out
of
herr
legacy
as
soon
as
he
had
set
off
for
the
breakfast
leon
ran
to
the
dwelling
of
his
sweetheart
everything
is
going
better
said
he
the
colonel
is
much
more
reasonable
he
has
promised
to
leave
for
paris
this
very
day
so
we
can
get
married
mlle
virginie
sambucco
praised
this
plan
of
proceeding
highly
not
only
because
she
had
made
great
preparations
for
the
wedding
but
because
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
would
be
the
talk
of
the
town
the
cards
were
already
out
the
mayor
notified
and
the
virgin
chapel
in
the
parish
church
engaged
to
revoke
all
this
at
the
caprice
of
a
ghost
and
a
fool
would
be
to
sin
against
custom
common
sense
and
heaven
itself
clementine
only
replied
with
tears
she
could
not
be
happy
without
marrying
leon
but
she
would
rather
die
she
said
than
give
her
hand
without
the
sanction
of
fougas
she
promised
to
implore
him
on
her
knees
if
necessary
and
wring
from
him
his
consent
but
if
he
refuses
and
it
too
likely
that
he
will
i
will
beseech
him
again
and
again
until
he
says
yes
everybody
conspired
to
convince
her
that
she
was
unreasonable
her
aunt
leon
and
mme
renault
martout
bonnivet
and
all
the
friends
of
the
two
families
at
length
she
yielded
but
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
door
flew
open
and
audret
rushed
into
the
parlor
crying
out
well
well
here
a
piece
of
news
colonel
fougas
is
going
to
fight
du
marnet
the
young
girl
fell
thunderstruck
into
the
arms
of
leon
renault
god
punishes
me
cried
she
and
the
chastisement
for
my
impiety
is
not
delayed
will
you
still
force
me
to
obey
you
shall
i
be
dragged
to
the
altar
in
spite
of
myself
at
the
very
hour
he
risking
his
life
no
one
dared
to
insist
longer
on
seeing
her
in
so
pitiable
a
state
but
leon
offered
up
earnest
prayers
that
victory
might
side
with
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
he
was
wrong
i
confess
but
what
lover
would
have
been
sinless
enough
to
cast
the
first
stone
at
him
and
here
is
an
account
of
how
the
precious
fougas
had
spent
his
day
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
youngest
two
captains
of
the
came
to
conduct
him
in
proper
style
to
the
residence
of
the
colonel
rollon
occupied
a
little
palace
of
the
imperial
epoch
a
marble
tablet
inserted
over
the
still
bore
the
words
des
a
souvenir
of
the
glorious
time
when
napoleon
court
followed
its
master
to
fontainebleau
colonel
rollon
the
the
the
three
majors
of
battalions
the
and
ten
or
a
dozen
officers
were
outside
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
illustrious
guest
from
the
other
world
the
flag
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
court
under
guard
of
the
ensign
and
a
squad
of
officers
selected
for
the
honor
the
band
of
the
regiment
at
the
entrance
of
the
garden
filled
up
the
background
of
the
picture
eight
panoplies
of
arms
which
had
been
improvised
the
same
morning
by
the
armorers
of
the
corps
embellished
the
walls
and
railings
a
company
of
grenadiers
with
their
arms
at
rest
were
in
attendance
at
the
entrance
of
fougas
the
band
played
the
famous
pour
la
syrie
the
grenadiers
presented
arms
the
drums
beat
a
salute
the
officers
and
soldiers
cried
le
colonel
fougas
the
officers
in
a
body
approached
the
patriarch
of
their
regiment
all
this
was
neither
regular
nor
according
to
discipline
but
we
can
well
allow
a
little
latitude
to
these
brave
soldiers
on
finding
their
ancestor
for
them
it
seemed
a
little
debauch
in
glory
the
hero
of
the
grasped
the
hands
of
the
colonel
and
officers
with
as
much
emotion
as
if
he
had
found
his
old
comrades
again
he
cordially
saluted
the
officers
and
soldiers
approached
the
flag
bent
one
knee
to
the
earth
raised
himself
loftily
grasped
the
staff
turned
toward
the
attentive
crowd
and
said
my
friends
under
the
shadow
of
the
flag
a
soldier
of
france
after
years
of
exile
finds
his
family
again
all
honor
to
thee
symbol
of
our
fatherland
old
partner
in
our
victories
and
heroic
support
in
our
misfortunes
thy
radiant
eagle
has
hovered
over
prostrate
and
trembling
europe
thy
bruised
eagle
has
again
dashed
obstinately
against
misfortune
and
terrified
the
sons
of
power
honor
to
thee
thou
who
hast
led
us
to
glory
and
fortified
us
against
the
clamor
of
despair
i
have
seen
thee
ever
foremost
in
the
fiercest
dangers
proud
flag
of
my
native
land
men
have
fallen
around
thee
like
grain
before
the
reaper
while
thou
alone
hast
shown
to
the
enemy
thy
front
unbending
and
superb
bullets
and
have
torn
thee
with
wounds
but
never
upon
thee
has
the
audacious
stranger
placed
his
hand
may
the
future
deck
thy
front
with
new
laurels
mayst
thou
conquer
new
and
realms
which
no
fatality
shall
rob
thee
of
the
day
of
great
deeds
is
being
born
again
believe
a
warrior
who
has
risen
from
the
tomb
to
tell
thee
so
yes
i
swear
it
by
the
spirit
of
him
who
led
us
at
wagram
there
shall
be
great
days
for
france
when
thou
shalt
shelter
with
thy
glorious
folds
the
fortunes
of
the
brave
eloquence
so
martial
and
patriotic
stirred
all
hearts
fougas
was
applauded
fêted
embraced
and
almost
carried
in
triumph
into
the
banquet
hall
seated
at
table
opposite
rollon
as
if
he
were
a
second
master
of
the
house
he
breakfasted
heartily
talked
a
great
deal
and
drank
more
yet
you
may
occasionally
meet
in
the
world
people
who
get
drunk
without
drinking
fougas
was
far
from
being
one
of
them
he
never
felt
his
equanimity
seriously
disturbed
short
of
three
bottles
often
in
fact
he
went
much
further
without
yielding
the
toasts
presented
at
dessert
were
distinguished
for
pith
and
cordiality
i
would
like
to
recount
them
in
order
but
am
forced
to
admit
that
they
would
take
up
too
much
room
and
that
the
last
which
were
the
most
touching
were
not
of
a
lucidity
absolutely
voltairian
they
arose
from
the
table
at
two
and
betook
themselves
in
a
body
to
the
where
the
officers
of
the
placed
a
punch
before
the
two
colonels
they
had
invited
with
a
feeling
of
eminent
propriety
the
superior
officers
of
the
regiment
of
cuirassiers
fougas
who
was
drunker
in
his
own
proper
person
than
a
whole
battalion
of
distributed
a
great
many
but
across
the
storm
which
disturbed
his
spirit
he
recognized
the
person
and
name
of
du
marnet
and
made
a
grimace
between
officers
and
above
all
between
officers
of
different
arms
of
the
service
politeness
is
a
little
excessive
etiquette
rather
severe
somewhat
susceptible
du
marnet
who
was
preëminently
a
man
of
the
world
understood
at
once
from
the
attitude
of
fougas
that
he
was
not
in
the
presence
of
a
friend
the
punch
appeared
blazing
went
out
with
its
strength
unimpaired
and
was
dispensed
with
a
big
ladle
into
threescore
glasses
fougas
drank
with
everybody
except
du
marnet
the
conversation
which
was
erratic
and
noisy
imprudently
raised
a
question
of
comparative
merits
an
officer
of
cuirassiers
asked
fougas
if
he
had
seen
splendid
charge
which
flung
the
austrians
into
the
valley
of
plauen
fougas
had
known
general
bordesoulle
personally
and
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
beautiful
heavy
cavalry
manoeuvre
which
decided
the
victory
of
dresden
but
he
chose
to
be
disagreeable
to
du
marnet
by
affecting
an
air
of
ignorance
or
indifference
in
our
time
said
he
the
cavalry
was
always
brought
into
action
after
the
battle
we
employed
it
to
bring
in
the
enemy
after
we
had
routed
them
here
a
great
outcry
arose
and
the
glorious
name
of
murat
was
thrown
into
the
balance
oh
doubtless
doubtless
said
he
shaking
his
head
murat
was
a
good
general
in
his
limited
sphere
he
answered
perfectly
for
all
that
was
wanted
of
him
but
if
the
cavalry
had
murat
the
infantry
had
napoleon
du
marnet
observed
judiciously
that
napoleon
if
he
must
be
seized
upon
for
the
credit
of
any
single
arm
of
the
service
would
belong
to
the
artillery
with
all
my
heart
monsieur
replied
fougas
the
artillery
and
the
infantry
artillery
at
a
distance
infantry
at
close
quarters
cavalry
off
at
one
side
once
more
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
du
marnet
you
mean
to
say
at
the
sides
which
is
a
very
different
matter
at
the
sides
or
at
one
side
i
do
care
as
for
me
if
i
were
i
would
set
the
cavalry
aside
several
cavalry
officers
had
already
flung
themselves
into
the
discussion
du
marnet
held
them
back
and
made
a
sign
that
he
wanted
to
answer
fougas
alone
and
why
then
if
you
please
would
you
set
the
cavalry
aside
because
the
dragoon
is
an
incomplete
soldier
incomplete
yes
sir
and
the
proof
is
that
the
government
has
to
buy
four
or
five
hundred
francs
worth
of
horse
in
order
to
complete
him
and
when
the
horse
receives
a
ball
or
a
bayonet
thrust
the
dragoon
is
no
longer
good
for
anything
have
you
ever
seen
a
cavalryman
on
foot
it
would
be
a
pretty
sight
i
see
myself
on
foot
every
day
and
i
do
see
anything
particularly
ridiculous
about
it
i
too
polite
to
contradict
you
and
for
me
sir
i
am
too
just
to
combat
one
paradox
with
another
what
would
you
think
of
my
logic
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
the
idea
is
not
mine
i
found
it
in
a
book
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
entertain
a
high
regard
for
infantry
but
after
all
the
foot
soldier
is
an
incomplete
soldier
deprived
of
his
birthright
an
inefficient
body
deprived
of
that
natural
complement
of
the
soldier
called
a
horse
i
admire
his
courage
i
perceive
that
he
makes
himself
useful
in
battle
but
after
all
the
poor
devil
has
only
two
feet
at
his
command
while
we
have
four
you
see
fit
to
consider
a
dragoon
on
foot
ridiculous
but
does
the
always
make
a
very
brilliant
appearance
when
one
sticks
a
horse
between
his
legs
i
have
seen
excellent
infantry
captains
cruelly
embarrassed
when
the
minister
of
war
made
them
majors
they
said
scratching
their
heads
not
over
when
we
mounted
a
grade
we
got
to
mount
a
horse
in
the
bargain
this
crude
pleasantry
amused
the
audience
for
a
moment
they
laughed
and
the
mustard
mounted
higher
and
higher
in
fougas
nose
in
my
time
said
he
a
foot
soldier
became
a
dragoon
in
hours
and
if
any
one
would
like
to
make
a
match
with
me
on
horseback
sabre
in
hand
i
show
him
what
infantry
is
monsieur
coolly
replied
du
marnet
i
hope
that
opportunities
will
not
be
lacking
to
you
in
the
field
of
battle
it
is
there
that
a
true
soldier
displays
his
talents
and
bravery
infantry
and
cavalry
we
alike
belong
to
france
i
drink
to
her
monsieur
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
touch
glasses
with
to
france
this
was
certainly
well
spoken
and
well
settled
the
clicking
of
glasses
applauded
du
marnet
fougas
himself
approached
his
adversary
and
drank
with
him
without
reserve
but
he
whispered
in
his
ear
speaking
very
thickly
i
hope
for
my
part
that
you
will
not
refuse
the
which
i
had
the
honor
to
propose
to
you
as
you
please
said
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
the
gentleman
from
the
other
world
drunker
than
ever
went
out
of
the
crowd
with
two
officers
whom
he
had
picked
up
haphazard
he
declared
to
them
that
he
considered
himself
insulted
by
du
marnet
that
a
challenge
had
been
given
and
accepted
and
that
the
affair
was
going
on
swimmingly
especially
added
he
in
confidence
since
there
is
a
lady
in
the
case
these
are
my
conditions
they
are
all
in
accordance
with
the
honor
of
the
infantry
the
army
and
france
we
will
fight
on
horseback
stripped
to
the
waist
mounted
bareback
on
two
stallions
the
weapon
the
cavalry
sabre
first
blood
i
want
to
chastise
a
puppy
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
rob
france
of
a
soldier
these
conditions
were
pronounced
absurd
by
du
marnet
seconds
they
accepted
them
nevertheless
for
the
military
code
requires
one
to
face
all
dangers
however
absurd
fougas
devoted
the
rest
of
the
day
to
worrying
the
poor
renaults
proud
of
the
control
he
exercised
over
clementine
he
declared
his
wishes
swore
he
would
take
her
for
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
rank
family
and
fortune
and
prohibited
her
to
dispose
of
herself
before
that
time
he
broke
openly
with
leon
and
his
parents
refused
to
accept
their
good
offices
any
longer
and
quitted
their
house
after
a
serious
passage
of
high
words
leon
concluded
by
saying
that
he
would
only
give
up
his
betrothed
with
life
itself
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
his
back
carrying
off
without
stopping
to
consider
what
he
was
doing
the
father
clothes
and
the
son
hat
he
asked
rollon
for
five
hundred
francs
engaged
a
room
at
the
du
went
to
bed
without
any
supper
and
slept
straight
through
until
the
arrival
of
his
seconds
there
was
no
necessity
for
giving
him
an
account
of
what
had
passed
the
previous
day
the
fogs
of
punch
and
sleep
dissipated
themselves
in
an
instant
he
plunged
his
head
and
hands
into
a
basin
of
fresh
water
and
said
so
much
for
my
toilet
now
let
go
and
get
into
line
the
field
selected
by
common
consent
was
the
a
sandy
plain
enclosed
in
the
forest
at
a
good
distance
from
the
town
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
betook
themselves
there
of
their
own
accord
there
would
have
been
no
need
of
inviting
them
more
than
one
soldier
went
secretly
and
billeted
himself
in
a
tree
the
itself
ornamented
the
little
family
with
its
presence
people
went
to
see
an
encounter
in
chivalric
tourney
not
merely
between
the
infantry
and
the
cavalry
but
between
the
old
army
and
the
young
the
exhibition
fully
satisfied
public
expectation
no
one
was
tempted
to
hiss
the
piece
and
everybody
had
his
money
worth
precisely
at
nine
the
combatants
entered
the
lists
attended
by
their
four
seconds
and
the
umpire
of
the
field
fougas
naked
to
the
waist
was
as
handsome
as
a
young
god
his
lithe
and
agile
figure
his
proud
and
radiant
features
the
manly
grace
of
his
movements
assured
him
a
flattering
reception
he
made
his
english
horse
caper
and
saluted
the
with
the
point
of
his
sword
du
marnet
a
man
rather
of
the
german
type
hardy
quite
hairy
moulded
like
the
indian
bacchus
and
not
like
achilles
showed
in
his
countenance
a
slight
shade
of
disgust
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
a
magician
to
understand
that
this
duel
under
the
eyes
of
his
own
officers
appeared
to
him
useless
and
even
ridiculous
his
horse
was
a
from
perche
a
vigorous
beast
and
full
of
fire
fougas
seconds
rode
badly
enough
they
divided
their
attention
between
the
combat
and
their
stirrups
du
marnet
had
chosen
the
best
two
horsemen
in
his
regiment
a
major
and
captain
the
umpire
of
the
field
was
colonel
rollon
an
excellent
rider
at
a
signal
given
by
colonel
rollon
fougas
rode
directly
at
his
adversary
presenting
the
point
of
his
sabre
in
the
position
of
prime
like
a
cavalry
soldier
charging
infantry
in
a
hollow
square
but
he
reined
up
about
three
lengths
from
du
marnet
and
described
around
him
seven
or
eight
rapid
circles
like
an
arab
in
a
play
du
marnet
being
forced
to
turn
in
the
same
spot
and
defend
himself
on
all
sides
clapped
both
spurs
to
his
horse
broke
the
circle
took
to
the
field
and
threatened
to
commence
the
same
manoeuvre
about
fougas
but
the
gentleman
from
the
other
world
did
not
wait
for
him
he
rushed
off
at
a
full
gallop
and
made
a
round
of
the
hippodrome
always
followed
by
du
marnet
the
cuirassier
being
heavier
and
mounted
on
a
slower
horse
was
distanced
he
revenged
himself
by
calling
out
to
fougas
oh
monsieur
i
must
say
that
this
looks
more
like
a
race
than
a
battle
i
ought
to
have
brought
a
instead
of
a
sword
but
fougas
panting
and
furious
had
already
turned
upon
him
hold
on
there
cried
he
i
have
shown
you
the
horseman
now
i
will
show
you
the
soldier
he
lanched
a
thrust
at
him
which
would
have
gone
through
him
like
a
hoop
if
du
marnet
had
not
been
as
prompt
as
at
parade
he
retorted
by
a
fine
cut
powerful
enough
to
cut
the
invincible
fougas
in
two
but
the
other
was
nimbler
than
a
monkey
he
wholly
shielded
his
body
by
letting
himself
slide
to
the
ground
and
then
remounted
his
horse
in
the
same
second
my
compliments
said
du
marnet
they
do
do
any
better
than
that
in
the
circus
no
more
do
they
in
war
rejoined
the
other
ah
scoundrel
so
you
revile
the
old
army
here
at
you
a
miss
thanks
for
the
retort
but
it
not
good
enough
yet
i
not
die
from
any
such
thrust
as
that
how
do
you
like
that
and
that
that
ah
you
claim
that
the
is
an
incomplete
man
now
we
going
to
make
assortment
of
limbs
a
little
incomplete
look
out
for
your
boot
parried
it
perhaps
he
expects
to
indulge
in
a
little
promenade
under
clementine
windows
this
evening
take
care
here
for
clementine
and
here
for
the
infantry
will
you
parry
that
so
traitor
and
that
so
he
does
perhaps
you
parry
them
all
then
by
heavens
victory
ah
monsieur
your
blood
is
flowing
what
have
i
done
devil
take
the
sword
the
horse
and
all
major
major
come
quickly
monsieur
let
yourself
rest
in
my
arms
beast
that
i
am
as
if
all
soldiers
were
not
brothers
oh
forgive
me
my
friend
would
that
i
could
redeem
each
drop
of
your
blood
with
all
of
mine
miserable
fougas
incapable
of
mastering
his
fierce
passions
ah
you
esculapian
mars
i
beg
you
tell
me
that
the
thread
of
his
days
is
not
to
be
clipped
i
will
not
survive
him
for
he
is
a
brave
du
marnet
had
received
a
magnificent
cut
which
traversed
the
left
arm
and
breast
and
the
blood
was
streaming
from
it
at
a
rate
to
make
one
shudder
the
surgeon
who
had
provided
himself
with
hemostatic
preparations
hastened
to
arrest
the
hemorrhage
the
wound
was
long
rather
than
deep
and
could
be
cured
in
a
few
days
fougas
himself
carried
his
adversary
to
the
carriage
but
that
did
not
satisfy
him
he
firmly
insisted
on
joining
the
two
officers
who
took
du
marnet
home
he
overwhelmed
the
wounded
man
with
his
protestations
and
was
occupied
during
most
of
the
ride
in
swearing
eternal
friendship
to
him
on
reaching
the
house
he
put
him
to
bed
embraced
him
bathed
him
with
tears
and
did
not
leave
him
for
a
moment
until
he
heard
him
snoring
when
six
struck
he
went
to
dine
at
the
hotel
in
company
with
his
seconds
and
the
referee
all
of
whom
he
had
invited
after
the
fight
he
treated
them
magnificently
and
got
drunk
himself
as
usual
chapter
xv
in
which
the
reader
will
see
that
it
is
not
far
from
the
capital
to
the
tarpeian
rock
the
next
day
after
a
visit
to
du
marnet
he
wrote
thus
to
clementine
light
of
my
life
i
am
about
to
quit
these
scenes
the
witnesses
of
my
fatal
courage
and
the
repositories
of
my
love
to
the
bosom
of
the
capital
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
i
will
first
betake
my
steps
if
the
successor
of
the
god
of
combats
is
not
deaf
to
the
voice
of
the
blood
that
courses
in
his
veins
he
will
restore
me
my
sword
and
epaulettes
so
that
i
may
lay
them
at
thy
feet
be
faithful
to
me
wait
hope
may
these
lines
be
to
thee
a
talisman
against
the
dangers
threatening
thy
independence
oh
my
clementine
tenderly
guard
thyself
for
thy
victor
fougas
clementine
sent
him
no
answer
but
just
as
he
was
getting
on
the
train
he
was
accosted
by
a
messenger
who
handed
him
a
pretty
red
leather
and
ran
away
with
all
his
might
the
was
entirely
new
solid
and
carefully
fastened
it
contained
twelve
hundred
francs
in
bank
notes
all
the
young
girl
savings
fougas
had
no
time
to
deliberate
on
this
delicate
circumstance
he
was
pushed
into
a
car
the
locomotive
puffed
and
the
train
started
the
colonel
began
to
review
in
his
memory
the
various
events
which
had
succeeded
each
other
in
his
life
during
less
than
a
week
his
arrest
among
the
frosts
of
the
vistula
his
sentence
to
death
his
imprisonment
in
the
fortress
of
liebenfeld
his
reawakening
at
fontainebleau
the
invasion
of
the
return
from
the
island
of
elba
the
hundred
days
the
death
of
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
rome
the
restoration
of
the
bonapartes
in
his
meeting
with
a
young
girl
who
was
the
counterpart
of
clementine
pichon
in
all
respects
the
flag
of
the
the
duel
with
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
all
this
for
fougas
had
not
taken
up
more
than
four
days
the
night
reaching
from
the
of
november
to
the
of
august
seemed
to
him
even
a
little
shorter
than
any
of
the
others
for
it
was
the
only
time
that
he
had
had
a
full
sleep
without
any
dreaming
a
less
active
spirit
and
a
heart
less
warm
would
perhaps
have
lapsed
into
a
sort
of
melancholy
for
in
fact
one
who
has
been
asleep
for
years
would
naturally
become
somewhat
alien
to
mankind
in
general
even
in
his
own
country
not
a
relation
not
a
friend
not
a
familiar
face
on
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
add
to
this
a
multitude
of
new
words
ideas
customs
and
inventions
which
make
him
feel
the
need
of
a
cicerone
and
prove
to
him
that
he
is
a
stranger
but
fougas
on
reopening
his
eyes
following
the
precept
of
horace
was
thrown
into
the
very
midst
of
action
he
had
improvised
for
him
friends
enemies
a
sweetheart
and
a
rival
fontainebleau
his
second
native
place
was
provisionally
the
central
point
of
his
existence
there
he
felt
himself
loved
hated
feared
admired
in
a
word
well
known
he
knew
that
in
that
his
name
could
not
be
spoken
without
awakening
an
echo
but
what
attached
him
more
than
all
to
modern
times
was
his
relationship
with
the
great
family
of
the
army
wherever
a
french
flag
floats
the
soldier
young
or
old
is
at
home
around
that
of
the
fatherland
though
dear
and
sacred
in
a
way
different
from
the
village
spire
language
ideas
and
institutions
change
but
little
the
death
of
individuals
has
little
effect
they
are
replaced
by
others
who
look
like
them
and
think
talk
and
act
in
the
same
way
who
do
not
stop
on
assuming
the
uniform
of
their
predecessors
but
inherit
their
souvenirs
also
the
glory
they
have
acquired
their
traditions
their
jests
and
even
certain
intonations
of
their
voices
this
accounts
for
fougas
sudden
friendship
after
a
first
feeling
of
jealousy
for
the
new
colonel
of
the
and
the
sudden
sympathy
which
he
evinced
for
du
marnet
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
blood
running
from
his
wound
quarrels
between
soldiers
are
family
quarrels
which
never
blot
out
the
relationship
calmly
satisfied
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
world
fougas
derived
pleasure
from
all
the
new
objects
which
civilization
placed
before
his
eyes
the
speed
of
the
fairly
intoxicated
him
he
was
inspired
with
a
positive
enthusiasm
for
this
force
of
steam
whose
theory
was
a
closed
book
to
him
but
on
whose
results
he
meditated
much
with
a
thousand
machines
like
this
two
thousand
rifled
cannon
and
two
hundred
thousand
such
chaps
as
i
am
napoleon
would
have
conquered
the
world
in
six
weeks
why
does
this
young
fellow
on
the
throne
make
some
use
of
the
resources
he
has
under
his
control
perhaps
he
thought
of
it
very
well
i
go
to
see
him
if
he
looks
like
a
man
of
capacity
i
give
him
my
idea
he
make
me
minister
of
war
and
then
forward
march
he
had
explained
to
him
the
use
of
the
great
iron
wires
running
on
poles
all
along
the
road
the
very
thing
said
he
here
are
both
fleet
and
judicious
get
them
all
into
the
hands
of
a
like
berthier
and
the
universe
would
be
held
in
a
thread
by
the
mere
will
of
a
man
his
meditations
were
interrupted
a
couple
of
miles
from
melun
by
the
sounds
of
a
foreign
language
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
then
bounded
from
his
corner
as
if
he
had
sat
on
a
pile
of
thorns
horror
it
was
english
one
of
those
monsters
who
had
assassinated
napoleon
at
helena
for
the
sake
of
insuring
to
themselves
the
cotton
monopoly
had
entered
the
compartment
with
a
very
pretty
woman
and
two
lovely
children
conductor
stop
cried
fougas
thrusting
his
body
halfway
out
of
the
window
monsieur
said
the
englishman
in
good
french
i
advise
you
to
have
patience
until
we
get
to
the
next
station
the
conductor
does
hear
you
and
you
in
danger
of
falling
out
on
the
track
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
i
have
a
flask
of
brandy
with
me
and
a
medicine
chest
no
sir
replied
fougas
in
a
most
supercilious
tone
i
in
want
of
nothing
and
i
rather
die
than
accept
anything
from
an
englishman
if
i
calling
the
conductor
it
only
because
i
want
to
get
into
a
different
car
and
cleanse
my
eyes
from
the
sight
of
an
enemy
of
the
emperor
i
assure
you
monsieur
responded
the
englishman
that
i
am
not
an
enemy
of
the
emperor
i
had
the
honor
of
being
received
by
him
while
he
was
in
london
he
even
deigned
to
pass
a
few
days
at
my
little
in
lancashire
so
much
the
better
for
you
if
this
young
man
is
good
enough
to
forget
what
you
have
done
against
his
family
but
fougas
will
never
forgive
your
crimes
against
his
country
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
station
at
melun
he
opened
the
door
and
rushed
into
another
saloon
there
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
presence
of
two
young
gentlemen
whose
physiognomies
were
far
from
english
and
who
spoke
french
with
the
purest
accent
of
touraine
both
had
coats
of
arms
on
their
so
that
no
one
might
be
ignorant
of
their
rank
as
nobles
fougas
was
too
plebeian
to
fancy
the
nobility
much
but
as
he
had
left
a
compartment
full
of
britons
he
was
happy
to
meet
a
couple
of
frenchmen
friends
said
he
inclining
toward
them
with
a
cordial
smile
we
are
children
of
the
same
mother
long
life
to
you
your
appearance
revives
me
the
two
young
gentlemen
opened
their
eyes
very
wide
half
bowed
and
resumed
their
conversation
without
making
any
other
response
to
advance
well
then
my
dear
astophe
said
one
you
saw
the
king
at
froshdorf
yes
my
good
americ
and
he
received
me
with
the
most
affecting
condescension
said
he
to
me
come
of
a
house
well
known
for
its
fidelity
we
will
remember
you
when
god
replaces
us
on
the
throne
of
our
ancestors
tell
our
brave
nobility
of
touraine
that
we
hope
to
be
remembered
in
their
prayers
and
that
we
never
forget
them
in
ours
pitt
and
coburg
said
fougas
between
his
teeth
here
are
two
little
rascals
conspiring
with
the
army
of
condé
but
patience
he
clenched
his
fists
and
opened
his
ears
did
he
say
anything
about
politics
a
few
vague
words
between
us
i
do
think
he
bothers
with
them
much
he
is
waiting
upon
events
he
not
wait
much
longer
who
can
tell
what
who
can
tell
the
empire
is
not
good
for
six
months
longer
monseigneur
de
montereau
said
so
again
last
monday
to
my
aunt
the
canoness
for
my
part
i
give
them
a
year
for
their
campaign
in
italy
has
strengthened
them
with
the
lower
orders
i
did
put
myself
out
to
tell
the
king
so
though
damnation
gentlemen
this
is
going
it
a
little
too
strongly
interrupted
fougas
is
it
here
in
france
that
frenchmen
speak
thus
of
french
institutions
go
back
to
your
master
tell
him
that
the
empire
is
eternal
because
it
is
founded
on
the
granite
of
popular
support
and
cemented
by
the
blood
of
heroes
and
if
the
king
asks
you
who
told
you
this
tell
him
it
was
colonel
fougas
who
was
decorated
at
wagram
by
the
emperor
own
hand
the
two
young
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
exchanged
a
smile
and
the
viscount
said
to
the
marquis
what
is
that
a
madman
no
dear
a
mad
dog
nothing
else
very
well
gentlemen
cried
the
colonel
speak
english
you
fit
for
it
he
changed
his
compartment
at
the
next
station
and
fell
in
with
a
lot
of
young
painters
he
called
them
disciples
of
zeuxis
and
asked
them
about
gérard
gros
and
david
these
gentlemen
found
the
sport
novel
and
recommended
him
to
go
and
see
talma
in
the
new
tragedy
of
arnault
the
fortifications
of
paris
dazzled
him
very
much
and
scandalized
him
a
little
i
do
like
this
said
he
to
his
companions
the
true
rampart
of
a
capital
is
the
courage
of
a
great
people
this
piling
bastions
around
paris
is
saying
to
the
enemy
that
it
is
possible
to
conquer
france
the
train
at
last
stopped
at
the
mazas
station
the
colonel
who
had
no
baggage
marched
out
pompously
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
look
for
the
de
as
he
had
spent
three
months
in
paris
about
the
year
he
considered
himself
acquainted
with
the
city
and
for
that
reason
he
did
not
fail
to
lose
himself
as
soon
as
he
got
there
but
in
the
various
quarters
which
he
traversed
at
hazard
he
admired
the
great
changes
which
had
been
wrought
during
his
absence
fougas
taste
was
for
having
streets
very
long
very
wide
and
bordered
with
very
large
houses
all
alike
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
the
parisian
style
was
rapidly
approaching
his
ideal
it
was
not
yet
absolute
perfection
but
progress
was
manifest
by
a
very
natural
illusion
he
paused
twenty
times
to
salute
people
of
familiar
appearance
but
no
one
recognized
him
after
a
walk
of
five
hours
he
reached
the
du
the
de
was
no
longer
there
but
the
louvre
had
been
erected
instead
fougas
employed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
regarding
this
monument
of
architecture
and
half
an
hour
in
contemplating
two
zouaves
of
the
guard
who
were
playing
piquet
he
inquired
if
the
emperor
was
in
paris
whereupon
his
attention
was
called
to
the
flag
floating
over
the
tuilleries
good
said
he
but
first
i
must
get
some
new
clothes
he
took
a
room
in
a
hotel
on
the
saint
and
asked
a
waiter
which
was
the
most
celebrated
tailor
in
paris
the
waiter
handed
him
a
business
directory
fougas
hunted
out
the
emperor
bootmaker
shirtmaker
hatter
tailor
barber
and
glovemaker
he
took
down
their
names
and
addresses
in
clementine
after
which
he
took
a
carriage
and
set
out
as
he
had
a
small
and
shapely
foot
he
found
boots
without
any
difficulty
he
was
promised
too
that
all
the
linen
he
required
should
be
sent
home
in
the
evening
but
when
he
came
to
explain
to
the
hatter
what
sort
of
an
apparatus
he
intended
to
plant
on
his
head
he
encountered
great
difficulties
his
ideal
was
an
enormous
hat
large
at
the
crown
small
below
broad
in
the
brim
and
curved
far
down
behind
and
before
in
a
word
the
historic
heirloom
to
which
the
founder
of
bolivia
gave
his
name
long
ago
the
shop
had
to
be
turned
upside
down
and
all
its
recesses
searched
to
find
what
he
wanted
at
last
cried
the
hatter
here
your
article
if
it
for
a
stage
dress
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
the
comic
effect
can
be
depended
upon
fougas
answered
dryly
that
the
hat
was
much
less
ridiculous
than
all
those
which
were
then
circulating
around
the
streets
of
paris
at
the
celebrated
tailor
in
the
de
la
there
was
almost
a
battle
no
monsieur
said
alfred
i
never
make
you
a
frogged
surtout
and
a
pair
of
trousers
la
go
to
babin
or
morean
if
you
want
a
carnival
dress
but
it
shall
never
be
said
that
a
man
of
as
good
figure
as
yours
left
our
establishment
caricatured
thunder
and
guns
retorted
fougas
you
a
head
taller
than
i
am
mister
giant
but
i
a
colonel
of
the
grand
empire
and
it
wo
do
for
to
give
orders
to
colonels
of
course
the
devil
of
a
fellow
had
the
last
word
his
measure
was
taken
a
book
of
costumes
consulted
and
a
promise
made
that
in
hours
he
should
be
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
of
cloths
were
presented
for
his
selection
among
them
some
english
fabrics
these
he
threw
aside
with
disgust
the
blue
cloth
of
france
cried
he
and
made
in
france
and
cut
it
in
such
a
style
that
any
one
seeing
me
in
pekin
would
say
a
soldier
the
officers
of
our
day
have
precisely
the
opposite
fancy
they
make
an
effort
to
resemble
all
other
gentlemen
when
they
assume
the
civilian
dress
fougas
ordered
in
the
a
black
satin
scarf
which
hid
his
shirt
and
reached
up
to
his
ears
then
he
went
toward
the
entered
a
celebrated
restaurant
and
ordered
his
dinner
for
breakfast
he
had
only
taken
a
bite
at
a
in
the
so
his
appetite
which
had
been
sharpened
by
the
excursion
did
wonders
he
ate
and
drank
as
he
did
at
fontainebleau
but
the
bill
seemed
to
him
hard
to
digest
it
was
for
a
hundred
and
ten
francs
and
a
few
centimes
the
devil
said
he
living
has
become
dear
in
paris
brandy
entered
into
the
sum
total
for
an
item
of
nine
francs
they
had
given
him
a
bottle
and
a
glass
about
the
size
of
a
thimble
this
gimcrack
had
amused
fougas
and
he
diverted
himself
by
filling
and
emptying
it
a
dozen
times
but
on
leaving
the
table
he
was
not
drunk
an
amiable
gayety
inspired
him
but
nothing
more
it
occurred
to
him
to
get
back
some
of
his
money
by
buying
some
lottery
tickets
at
number
but
a
located
in
that
building
apprised
him
that
france
had
not
gambled
for
thirty
years
he
pushed
on
to
the
to
see
if
the
emperor
actors
might
not
be
giving
some
fine
tragedy
but
the
poster
disgusted
him
modern
comedies
played
by
new
actors
neither
talma
nor
fleury
nor
thénard
nor
the
baptistes
nor
mlle
mars
nor
mlle
raucourt
he
then
went
to
the
opera
where
charles
vi
was
being
given
the
music
astounded
him
at
once
he
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
so
much
noise
anywhere
but
on
the
nevertheless
his
ears
soon
inured
themselves
to
the
clangor
of
the
instruments
and
the
fatigue
of
the
day
the
pleasure
of
being
comfortably
seated
and
the
labor
of
digestion
plunged
him
into
a
doze
he
woke
up
with
a
start
at
this
famous
patriotic
song
aux
tyrans
jamais
jamais
en
france
ne
régnera
no
cried
he
stretching
out
his
arms
toward
the
stage
never
let
us
swear
it
together
on
the
sacred
altar
of
our
native
land
perish
perfidious
albion
the
pit
and
orchestra
arose
at
once
less
to
express
accord
with
sentiments
than
to
silence
him
during
the
following
a
commissioner
of
police
said
in
his
ear
that
when
one
had
dined
as
he
had
one
ought
to
go
quietly
to
bed
instead
of
interrupting
the
performance
of
the
opera
he
replied
that
he
had
dined
as
usual
and
that
this
explosion
of
patriotic
sentiment
had
not
proceeded
from
the
stomach
but
said
he
when
in
this
palace
of
misused
magnificence
hatred
of
the
enemy
is
stigmatized
as
a
crime
i
must
go
and
breathe
a
freer
air
and
bow
before
the
temple
of
glory
before
i
go
to
bed
you
do
well
to
do
so
said
the
policeman
he
went
out
haughtier
and
more
erect
than
ever
reached
the
boulevard
and
ran
with
great
strides
as
far
as
the
corinthian
temple
at
the
end
while
on
his
way
he
greatly
admired
the
lighting
of
the
city
martout
had
explained
to
him
the
manufacture
of
gas
he
had
not
understood
anything
about
it
but
the
glowing
and
ruddy
flame
was
an
actual
treat
to
his
eyes
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
monument
commanding
the
entrance
to
the
he
stopped
on
the
pavement
collected
his
thoughts
for
an
instant
and
exclaimed
oh
glory
inspirer
of
great
deeds
widow
of
the
mighty
conqueror
of
europe
receive
the
homage
of
thy
devoted
victor
fougas
for
thee
i
have
endured
hunger
sweat
and
frost
and
eaten
the
most
faithful
of
horses
for
thee
i
am
ready
to
brave
further
perils
and
again
to
face
death
on
every
i
seek
thee
rather
than
happiness
riches
or
power
reject
not
the
offering
of
my
heart
and
the
sacrifice
of
my
blood
as
the
price
of
such
devotion
i
ask
nothing
but
a
smile
from
thy
eyes
and
a
laurel
from
thy
hand
this
prayer
went
all
glowing
to
the
ears
of
marie
the
patroness
of
the
of
glory
thus
the
purchaser
of
a
chateau
sometimes
receives
a
letter
addressed
to
the
original
proprietor
fougas
returned
by
the
de
la
and
the
and
saluted
in
passing
the
only
familiar
figure
he
had
yet
found
in
paris
the
new
costume
of
napoleon
on
the
column
did
not
displease
him
in
any
way
he
preferred
the
cocked
hat
to
a
crown
and
the
gray
surtout
to
a
theatrical
cloak
the
night
was
restless
in
the
colonel
brain
a
thousand
diverse
projects
crossed
each
other
in
all
directions
he
prepared
the
little
speech
which
he
should
make
to
the
emperor
going
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
a
phrase
and
waking
up
with
a
start
in
the
attempt
to
lay
hold
on
the
idea
which
had
so
suddenly
vanished
he
put
out
and
relit
his
candle
twenty
times
the
recollection
of
clementine
was
occasionally
intermingled
with
dreams
of
war
and
political
utopias
but
i
must
confess
that
the
young
girl
figure
seldom
got
any
higher
than
the
second
place
but
if
the
night
appeared
too
long
the
morning
seemed
short
in
proportion
the
idea
of
meeting
the
new
master
of
the
empire
face
to
face
inspired
and
chilled
him
in
turn
for
an
instant
he
hoped
that
something
would
be
lacking
in
his
toilet
that
some
shopkeeper
would
furnish
him
an
honorable
pretext
for
postponing
his
visit
until
the
next
day
but
everybody
displayed
the
most
desperate
punctuality
precisely
at
noon
the
trousers
la
and
the
frogged
surtout
were
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
opposite
the
famous
bolivar
hat
i
may
as
well
be
dressing
said
fougas
possibly
this
young
man
may
not
be
at
home
in
that
case
i
leave
my
name
and
wait
until
he
sends
for
me
he
got
himself
up
gorgeously
in
his
own
way
and
although
it
may
appear
impossible
to
my
readers
fougas
in
a
black
satin
scarf
and
frogged
surtout
was
not
homely
nor
even
ridiculous
his
tall
figure
lithe
build
lofty
and
impressive
carriage
and
brusque
movements
were
all
in
a
certain
harmony
with
the
costume
of
the
olden
time
he
appeared
strange
and
that
was
all
to
keep
his
courage
up
he
dropped
into
a
restaurant
ate
four
cutlets
a
loaf
of
bread
a
slice
of
cheese
and
washed
it
all
down
with
two
bottles
of
wine
the
coffee
and
supplements
brought
him
up
to
two
and
that
was
the
time
he
had
set
for
himself
he
tipped
his
hat
slightly
over
one
ear
buttoned
his
buckskin
gloves
coughed
energetically
two
or
three
times
before
the
sentinel
at
the
de
and
marched
bravely
into
the
gate
monsieur
cried
the
porter
what
do
you
want
the
emperor
have
you
an
audience
letter
colonel
fougas
does
not
need
one
go
and
ask
references
of
him
who
towers
over
the
he
tell
you
that
the
name
of
fougas
has
always
been
a
synonym
for
bravery
and
fidelity
you
knew
the
first
emperor
yes
my
little
joker
and
i
have
talked
with
him
just
as
i
am
talking
with
you
indeed
but
how
old
are
you
then
seventy
years
on
the
of
time
years
on
the
tablets
of
history
the
porter
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
murmured
still
another
this
makes
the
fourth
for
this
week
he
made
a
sign
to
a
little
gentleman
in
black
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
court
of
the
tuilleries
then
he
said
to
fougas
putting
his
hand
on
his
arm
so
my
good
friend
you
want
to
see
the
emperor
i
already
told
you
so
familiar
individual
very
well
you
shall
see
him
that
gentleman
going
along
there
with
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
is
the
one
who
introduces
visitors
he
will
take
care
of
you
but
the
emperor
is
not
in
the
palace
he
is
in
the
country
it
all
the
same
to
you
is
it
if
you
do
have
to
go
into
the
country
what
the
devil
do
you
suppose
i
care
only
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
go
on
foot
a
carriage
has
already
been
ordered
for
you
come
my
good
fellow
get
in
and
be
reasonable
two
minutes
later
fougas
accompanied
by
a
detective
was
riding
to
a
police
station
his
business
was
soon
disposed
of
the
commissary
who
received
him
was
the
same
one
who
had
spoken
to
him
the
previous
evening
at
the
opera
a
doctor
was
called
and
gave
the
best
verdict
of
monomania
that
ever
sent
a
man
to
charenton
all
this
was
done
politely
and
pleasantly
without
a
word
which
could
put
the
colonel
on
his
guard
or
give
him
a
suspicion
of
the
fate
held
in
reserve
for
him
he
merely
found
the
ceremonial
rather
long
and
peculiar
and
prepared
on
the
spot
several
sentences
which
he
promised
himself
the
honor
of
repeating
to
the
emperor
at
last
he
was
permitted
to
resume
his
route
the
hack
had
been
kept
waiting
the
relit
his
pipe
said
three
words
to
the
driver
and
seated
himself
at
the
left
of
the
colonel
the
carriage
set
off
at
a
trot
reached
the
and
took
the
direction
of
the
bastille
it
had
gotten
opposite
the
and
fougas
with
his
head
at
the
window
was
continuing
the
composition
of
his
impromptu
speech
when
an
open
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
superb
chestnuts
passed
so
to
speak
under
his
very
nose
a
portly
man
with
a
gray
moustache
turned
his
head
and
cried
fougas
robinson
crusoe
discovering
the
human
footprint
on
his
island
was
not
more
astonished
and
delighted
than
our
hero
on
hearing
that
cry
of
fougas
to
open
the
door
jump
out
into
the
road
run
to
the
carriage
which
had
been
stopped
fling
himself
into
it
at
a
single
bound
without
the
help
of
the
step
and
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
portly
gentleman
with
the
gray
moustache
was
all
the
work
of
a
second
the
barouche
had
long
disappeared
when
the
detective
at
a
gallop
followed
by
his
hack
at
a
trot
traversed
the
line
of
the
asking
all
the
policemen
if
they
had
not
seen
a
crazy
man
pass
that
way
chapter
xvi
the
memorable
interview
between
colonel
fougas
and
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
the
french
in
falling
upon
the
neck
of
the
big
man
with
the
gray
moustache
fougas
supposed
he
was
embracing
massena
he
naturally
intimated
as
much
to
him
whereupon
the
owner
of
the
barouche
burst
into
a
great
peal
of
laughter
ah
my
poor
old
boy
said
he
it
a
long
time
since
we
buried
the
of
victory
look
me
square
in
the
face
i
am
leblanc
of
the
russian
campaign
impossible

little
leblanc
lieutenant
in
the
artillery
who
shared
with
you
a
million
of
dangers
and
that
famous
piece
of
roast
horse
which
you
salted
with
your
tears
well
upon
my
soul
it
you
you
cut
me
out
a
pair
of
boots
from
the
skin
of
the
unfortunate
zephyr
and
we
need
speak
of
the
number
of
times
you
saved
my
life
oh
my
brave
and
faithful
friend
thank
god
that
i
embrace
you
once
more
yes
i
recognize
you
now
but
i
say
that
you
are
changed
gad
have
been
preserved
in
a
jug
of
spirits
of
wine
for
my
part
you
know
my
history
then
i
heard
it
told
last
night
at
the
minister
of
public
instruction
he
had
there
the
savant
who
set
you
on
your
legs
again
i
even
wrote
to
you
on
getting
back
home
to
offer
you
a
bunk
and
a
place
at
mess
but
my
letter
is
on
the
way
to
fontainebleau
thanks

sound
one
ah
my
poor
old
boy
what
things
have
happened
since
beresina

all
the
misfortunes
that
have
come

them
and
that
sadder

i
was
a
major
after
waterloo
the
bourbons
put
me
aside
on
my
friends
got
me
back
into
service
again
in
but
i
had
bad
luck
and
lazed
around
in
garrisons
at
lille
grenoble
and
strasburg
without
getting
ahead
any
my
second
epaulette
did
not
reach
me
till
then
i
took
a
little
turn
in
africa
i
was
made
at
isly
got
home
again
and
banged
about
from
pillar
to
post
until
during
that
year
we
had
a
june
campaign
in
paris
itself
my
heart
still
bleeds
every
time
i
think
of
it
and
upon
my
soul
you
blest
in
not
having
seen
it
i
got
three
balls
in
my
body
and
a
commission
as
general
of
division
after
all
i
no
right
to
complain
for
the
campaign
in
italy
brought
me
good
luck
here
i
am
marshal
of
france
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
income
and
duke
of
solferino
in
the
bargain
yes
the
emperor
has
put
a
handle
to
my
name
the
fact
is
that
short
was
a
little
too
short
thunderation
cried
fougas
that
splendid
i
swear
leblanc
that
i
not
jealous
of
your
good
fortune
it
seldom
enough
that
one
soldier
rejoices
over
the
promotion
of
another
but
indeed
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
assure
you
that
i
do
now
it
all
the
better
since
you
deserved
your
honors
and
the
blind
goddess
must
have
had
a
glimpse
of
your
heart
and
talents
over
the
bandage
that
covers
her
eyes
you
very
kind
but
let
talk
about
yourself
now
where
were
you
going
when
i
met
you
to
see
the
emperor
so
was
i
but
where
the
devil
were
you
looking
for
him
i
do
know
somebody
was
showing
me
the
way
but
he
is
at
the
tuilleries
no
yes
there
something
under
all
this
tell
me
about
it
fougas
did
not
wait
to
be
urged
the
marshal
soon
understood
from
what
sort
of
danger
he
had
extricated
his
friend
the
is
mistaken
said
he
the
emperor
is
at
the
palace
and
as
we
reached
there
now
come
with
me
perhaps
i
can
present
you
after
my
audience
the
very
thing
leblanc
my
heart
beats
at
the
idea
of
seeing
this
young
man
is
he
a
good
one
can
he
be
counted
upon
is
he
anything
like
the
other
you
can
see
for
yourself
wait
here
the
friendship
of
these
two
men
dated
from
the
winter
of
during
the
retreat
of
the
french
army
chance
flung
the
lieutenant
of
artillery
and
the
colonel
of
the
together
one
was
eighteen
years
old
the
other
not
quite
the
distance
between
their
ranks
was
easily
bridged
over
by
common
danger
all
men
are
equal
before
hunger
cold
and
fatigue
one
morning
leblanc
at
the
head
of
ten
men
rescued
fougas
from
the
hands
of
the
cossacks
then
fougas
sabred
a
half
dozen
stragglers
who
were
trying
to
steal
leblanc
cloak
eight
days
later
leblanc
pulled
his
friend
out
of
a
hut
which
the
peasants
had
set
on
fire
and
fougas
in
turn
fished
leblanc
out
of
the
beresina
the
list
of
their
dangers
and
their
mutual
services
is
too
long
for
me
to
give
entire
to
finish
off
the
colonel
at
koenigsberg
passed
three
weeks
at
the
bedside
of
the
lieutenant
who
was
attacked
with
fever
and
ague
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
tender
care
saved
his
life
this
reciprocal
devotion
had
formed
between
them
bonds
so
strong
that
a
separation
of
years
could
not
break
them
fougas
alone
in
a
great
saloon
was
buried
in
the
recollections
of
that
good
old
time
when
an
usher
asked
him
to
remove
his
gloves
and
go
into
the
cabinet
of
the
emperor
respect
for
the
powers
that
be
which
is
the
very
foundation
of
my
character
does
not
permit
me
to
bring
august
personages
upon
the
scene
but
fougas
correspondence
belongs
to
contemporaneous
history
and
here
is
the
letter
which
he
wrote
to
clementine
on
returning
to
his
hotel
paris
what
am
i
saying
heaven
my
sweet
angel
i
am
intoxicated
with
joy
gratitude
and
admiration
i
have
seen
him
i
have
spoken
to
him
he
gave
me
his
hand
he
made
me
be
seated
he
is
a
great
prince
he
will
be
the
master
of
the
world
he
gave
me
the
medal
of
helena
and
the
cross
of
an
officer
little
leblanc
an
old
friend
and
a
true
heart
conducted
me
into
his
presence
he
is
marshal
of
france
too
and
a
duke
of
the
new
empire
as
for
promotion
there
no
more
need
of
speculation
on
that
head
a
prisoner
of
war
in
prussia
and
in
a
triple
coffin
i
return
with
my
rank
so
says
the
military
law
but
in
less
than
three
months
i
shall
be
a
that
certain
he
deigned
to
promise
it
to
me
himself
what
a
man
a
god
on
earth
no
more
conceited
than
he
of
wagram
and
moscow
and
like
him
the
father
of
the
soldier
he
wanted
to
give
me
money
from
his
private
purse
to
replace
my
equipments
i
answered
sire
i
have
a
claim
to
recover
at
dantzic
if
it
is
paid
i
shall
be
rich
if
the
debt
is
denied
my
pay
will
suffice
for
me
thereupon
o
beneficence
of
princes
thou
art
not
then
but
an
empty
name
he
smiled
slightly
and
said
twisting
his
moustache
remained
in
prussia
from
to
sire
of
war
under
exceptional
conditions
sire
treaties
of
and
stipulated
for
the
release
of
prisoners
sire
have
been
violated
then
in
your
case
sire
then
prussia
owes
you
an
indemnity
i
will
see
that
it
is
recovered
by
diplomatic
proceedings
sire
what
goodness
now
an
idea
which
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
squeeze
money
out
of
prussia
prussia
who
showed
herself
so
greedy
for
our
treasures
in
and
my
clementine
oh
may
our
glorious
and
magnanimous
sovereign
live
forever
et
le
prince
imperial
i
saw
them
the
emperor
presented
me
to
his
family
the
prince
is
an
admirable
little
soldier
he
condescended
to
beat
the
drum
on
my
new
hat
i
wept
with
emotion
her
majesty
the
empress
said
with
an
angelic
smile
that
she
had
heard
my
misfortunes
spoken
of
madame
i
replied
a
moment
as
this
compensates
them
a
hundred
fold
must
come
and
dance
at
the
tuilleries
next
winter
madame
i
have
never
danced
but
to
the
music
of
cannon
but
i
shall
spare
no
effort
to
please
you
i
will
study
the
art
of
vestris
managed
to
learn
the
quadrille
very
nicely
joined
in
leblanc
the
emperor
deigned
to
express
his
happiness
at
getting
back
an
officer
like
me
who
had
yesterday
so
to
speak
taken
part
in
the
finest
campaigns
of
the
century
and
retained
all
the
traditions
of
the
great
war
this
encouraged
me
i
no
longer
feared
to
remind
him
of
the
famous
principle
of
the
good
old
time
to
treat
for
peace
only
in
capitals
care
said
he
was
on
the
strength
of
that
principle
that
the
allied
armies
twice
came
to
settle
the
basis
of
peace
at
paris
not
come
here
again
cried
i
passing
over
my
body
i
dwelt
upon
the
troubles
apt
to
come
from
too
much
intimacy
with
england
i
expressed
a
hope
of
at
once
proceeding
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
first
to
get
back
our
frontiers
for
ourselves
next
the
natural
frontiers
of
europe
for
europe
is
but
the
suburb
of
france
and
can
not
he
annexed
too
soon
the
emperor
shook
his
head
as
if
he
was
not
of
my
opinion
does
he
entertain
peaceful
designs
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
upon
this
idea
it
would
kill
me
he
asked
me
what
impressions
i
had
formed
regarding
the
appearance
of
the
changes
which
had
been
made
in
paris
i
answered
with
the
sincerity
of
a
lofty
soul
the
new
paris
is
the
great
work
of
a
great
reign
but
i
entertain
the
hope
that
your
improvements
have
not
yet
had
the
finishing
touch
is
left
to
be
done
now
in
your
opinion
of
all
to
remedy
the
course
of
the
seine
whose
irregular
curve
is
positively
shocking
the
straight
line
is
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
for

as
well
as
boulevards

the
second
place
to

and
suppress
all
inequalites
of
surface
which
seem
to
say
to
the
government
art
less
powerful
than
nature
having
accomplished
this
preparatory
work
i
would
trace
a
circle
three
leagues
in
diameter
whose
circumference
marked
by
an
elegant
railing
should
be
the
boundary
of
paris
at
the

would
build

much
more

answered
i
at
this
remark
an
unreserved
hilarity
the
cause
of
which
i
am
unable
to
explain
lit
up
his
serious
countenance
you
think
said
he
your
project
would
ruin
a
great
many
people
what
difference
does
it
make
to
me
i
cried
it
will
ruin
none
but
the
rich
he
began
laughing
again
and
bid
me
farewell
saying
you
will
have
to
remain
colonel
only
until
we
make
you
he
permitted
me
to
press
his
hand
a
second
time
i
waved
an
adieu
to
brave
leblanc
who
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
this
evening

i
returned
to
my

pour
my
joy
into
your

soul
oh

on
you
shall
be
happy
and
i
shall
be

want
you
to
be

v
fougas
the
subscribers
to
who
keep
files
of
their
paper
are
hereby
requested
to
hunt
up
the
number
for
the
of
august
in
it
they
will
find
two
paragraphs
of
local
intelligence
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
copying
here
his
excellency
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
yesterday
had
the
honor
of
presenting
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
a
hero
of
the
first
empire
colonel
fougas
whom
an
almost
miraculous
event
already
mentioned
in
a
report
to
the
academy
of
sciences
has
restored
to
his
country
such
was
the
first
paragraph
here
is
the
second
a
madman
the
fourth
this
week
but
the
most
dangerous
of
all
presented
himself
yesterday
at
one
of
the
entrances
of
the
tuilleries
decked
out
in
a
grotesque
costume
his
eyes
flashing
his
hat
cocked
over
his
ear
and
addressing
the
most
respectable
people
with
rudeness
he
attempted
to
force
his
way
past
the
sentry
and
thrust
himself
for
what
purpose
god
only
knows
into
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
during
his
incoherent
ejaculations
the
following
words
were
distinguished
column
fidelity
the
of
time
the
tablets
of
history
when
he
was
arrested
by
one
of
the
detective
watch
and
taken
before
the
police
commissioner
of
the
tuilleries
section
he
was
recognized
as
the
same
individual
who
the
evening
before
at
the
opera
had
interrupted
the
performance
of
charles
vi
with
most
unseemly
cries
after
the
customary
medical
and
legal
proceedings
he
was
ordered
to
be
sent
to
the
charenton
hospital
but
opposite
the
taking
advantage
of
a
lock
among
the
vehicles
and
of
the
herculean
strength
with
which
he
is
endowed
he
wrested
his
hands
from
his
keeper
threw
him
down
beat
him
leaped
at
a
bound
into
the
street
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
the
most
active
search
was
immediately
set
on
foot
and
we
have
it
from
the
best
authority
that
the
police
are
already
on
the
track
of
the
fugitive
chapter
xvii
wherein
herr
nicholas
meiser
one
of
the
solid
men
of
dantzic
receives
an
unwelcome
visit
the
wisdom
of
mankind
declares
that
gains
never
do
any
good
i
maintain
that
they
do
the
robbers
more
good
than
the
robbed
and
the
good
fortune
of
herr
nicholas
meiser
is
an
argument
in
support
of
my
proposition
the
nephew
of
the
illustrious
physiologist
after
brewing
a
great
deal
of
beer
from
a
very
little
hops
and
prematurely
appropriating
the
legacy
intended
for
fougas
had
amassed
by
various
operations
a
fortune
of
from
eight
to
ten
millions
in
what
kind
of
operations
no
one
ever
told
me
but
i
know
that
he
called
all
operations
that
would
make
money
good
ones
to
lend
small
sums
at
a
big
interest
to
accumulate
great
stores
of
grain
in
order
to
relieve
a
scarcity
after
producing
it
himself
to
foreclose
on
unfortunate
debtors
to
fit
out
a
vessel
or
two
for
trade
in
black
flesh
on
the
african
coast
such
are
specimens
of
the
speculations
which
the
good
man
did
not
despise
he
never
boasted
of
them
for
he
was
modest
but
he
never
blushed
for
them
for
he
had
expanded
his
conscience
simultaneously
with
his
capital
as
for
the
rest
he
was
a
man
of
honor
in
the
commercial
sense
of
the
word
and
capable
of
strangling
the
whole
human
race
rather
than
of
letting
his
signature
be
protested
the
banks
of
dantzic
berlin
vienna
and
paris
held
him
in
high
esteem
his
money
passed
through
all
of
them
he
was
fat
unctuous
and
florid
and
lived
well
his
wife
nose
was
much
too
long
and
her
bones
much
too
prominent
but
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
and
made
him
little
sweetmeats
a
perfect
congeniality
of
sentiment
united
this
charming
couple
they
talked
with
each
other
with
open
hearts
and
never
thought
of
keeping
back
any
of
their
evil
thoughts
every
year
at
saint
martin
day
when
rents
became
due
they
turned
out
of
doors
the
families
of
five
or
six
workmen
who
could
not
pay
for
their
terms
but
they
dined
none
the
worse
after
it
and
their
kiss
was
none
the
less
sweet
the
husband
was
years
old
the
wife
their
physiognomies
were
such
as
inspire
benevolence
and
command
respect
to
complete
their
outward
resemblance
to
the
patriarchs
nothing
was
needed
but
children
and
grandchildren
nature
had
given
them
one
son
an
only
one
because
they
had
not
solicited
nature
for
more
they
would
have
thought
it
criminal
improvidence
to
divide
their
fortune
among
several
unhappily
this
only
child
the
to
so
many
millions
died
at
the
university
of
heidelberg
from
eating
too
many
sausages
he
set
out
when
he
was
twenty
for
that
valhalla
of
german
students
where
they
eat
infinite
sausages
and
drink
inexhaustible
beer
where
they
sing
songs
of
eight
hundred
million
verses
and
gash
the
tips
of
each
other
noses
with
huge
swords
envious
death
snatched
him
from
his
parents
when
they
were
no
longer
of
an
age
to
improvise
a
successor
the
unfortunate
old
millionnaires
tenderly
collected
his
effects
to
sell
them
during
this
operation
so
trying
to
their
souls
for
there
was
a
great
deal
of
linen
that
could
not
be
found
nicholas
meiser
said
to
his
wife
my
heart
bleeds
at
the
idea
that
our
buildings
and
dollars
our
goods
above
ground
and
under
should
go
to
strangers
parents
ought
always
to
have
an
extra
son
just
as
they
have
a
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
but
time
who
is
a
great
teacher
in
germany
and
several
other
countries
led
them
to
see
that
there
is
consolation
for
all
things
except
the
loss
of
money
five
years
afterwards
frau
meiser
said
to
her
husband
with
a
tender
and
philosophic
smile
who
can
fathom
the
decrees
of
providence
perhaps
your
son
would
have
brought
us
to
a
crust
look
at
theobald
scheffler
his
old
comrade
he
wasted
twenty
thousand
francs
at
paris
on
a
woman
who
kicked
up
her
legs
in
the
middle
of
a
quadrille
we
ourselves
spent
more
than
two
thousand
thalers
a
year
for
our
wicked
scapegrace
his
death
is
a
great
saving
and
therefore
a
good
thing
as
long
as
the
three
coffins
of
fougas
were
in
the
house
the
good
dame
scolded
at
the
visions
and
restlessness
of
her
husband
what
in
the
name
of
sense
are
you
thinking
about
you
been
kicking
me
all
night
again
let
throw
this
ragamuffin
of
a
frenchman
into
the
fire
then
he
no
longer
disturb
the
repose
of
a
peaceable
family
we
can
sell
the
leaden
box
it
must
weigh
at
least
two
hundred
pounds
the
white
silk
will
make
me
a
good
lining
for
a
dress
and
the
wool
in
the
stuffing
will
easily
make
us
a
mattress
but
a
tinge
of
superstition
prevented
meiser
from
following
his
wife
advice
he
preferred
to
rid
himself
of
the
colonel
by
selling
him
the
house
of
this
worthy
couple
was
the
handsomest
and
most
substantial
on
the
street
of
public
wells
in
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
city
strong
railings
in
iron
open
work
decorated
all
the
windows
magnificently
and
the
door
was
sheathed
in
iron
like
a
knight
of
the
olden
time
a
system
of
little
mirrors
ingeniously
arranged
in
the
entrance
enabled
a
visitor
to
be
seen
before
he
had
even
knocked
a
single
servant
a
regular
horse
for
work
and
camel
for
temperance
ministered
under
this
roof
blessed
by
the
gods
the
old
servant
slept
away
from
the
house
both
because
he
preferred
to
and
because
while
he
did
so
he
could
not
be
tempted
to
wring
the
venerable
necks
of
his
employers
a
few
books
on
commerce
and
religion
constituted
the
library
of
the
two
old
people
they
never
cared
to
have
a
garden
at
the
back
of
their
house
because
the
shrubbery
might
conceal
thieves
they
fastened
their
door
with
bolts
every
evening
at
eight
and
never
went
out
without
being
obliged
to
for
fear
of
meeting
dangerous
people
and
nevertheless
on
the
of
april
at
eleven
in
the
morning
nicholas
meiser
was
far
away
from
his
beloved
home
gracious
how
very
far
away
for
him
this
honest
burgher
of
dantzic
he
was
traversing
with
heavy
tread
the
promenade
in
berlin
which
bears
the
name
of
one
of
alphonse
karrs
romances
les
in
german
den
what
mighty
agency
had
thrown
out
of
his
box
this
big
red
on
two
legs
the
same
that
led
alexander
to
babylon
scipio
to
carthage
godfrey
de
bouillon
to
jerusalem
and
napoleon
to
moscow
ambition
meiser
did
not
expect
to
be
presented
with
the
keys
of
the
city
on
a
cushion
of
red
velvet
but
he
knew
a
great
lord
a
clerk
in
a
government
office
and
a
chambermaid
who
were
working
to
get
a
patent
of
nobility
for
him
to
call
himself
von
meiser
instead
of
plain
meiser
what
a
glorious
dream
this
good
man
had
in
his
character
that
compound
of
meanness
and
vanity
which
places
lacqueys
so
far
apart
from
the
rest
of
mankind
full
of
respect
for
power
and
admiration
for
conventional
greatness
he
never
pronounced
the
name
of
king
prince
or
even
baron
without
emphasis
and
unction
he
mouthed
every
aristocratic
syllable
and
the
single
word
monseigneur
seemed
to
him
like
a
mouthful
of
soup
examples
of
this
disposition
are
not
rare
in
germany
and
are
even
occasionally
found
elsewhere
if
they
could
be
transported
to
a
country
where
all
men
are
equal
homesickness
for
would
kill
them
the
claims
brought
to
bear
in
favor
of
nicholas
meiser
were
not
of
the
kind
which
at
once
spring
the
balance
but
of
the
kind
which
make
it
turn
little
by
little
nephew
of
an
illustrious
man
of
science
powerfully
rich
a
man
of
sound
judgment
a
subscriber
to
the
gazette
of
the
full
of
hatred
for
the
opposition
author
of
a
toast
against
the
influence
of
demagogues
once
a
member
of
the
city
council
once
an
umpire
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
once
a
corporal
in
the
militia
and
an
open
enemy
of
poland
and
all
nations
but
the
strong
ones
his
most
brilliant
action
dated
back
ten
years
he
had
denounced
by
an
anonymous
letter
a
member
of
the
french
parliament
who
had
taken
refuge
in
dantzic
while
meiser
was
walking
under
the
lindens
his
cause
was
progressing
swimmingly
he
had
received
that
sweet
assurance
from
the
very
lips
of
its
promoters
and
so
he
tripped
lightly
toward
the
depot
of
the
railroad
without
any
other
baggage
than
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
his
black
leather
trunk
had
gone
before
and
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
station
on
the
way
he
was
glancing
into
the
shop
windows
when
he
stopped
short
before
a
stationer
and
rubbed
his
eyes
a
sovereign
remedy
people
say
for
impaired
vision
between
the
portraits
of
mme
sand
and
mérimée
the
two
greatest
writers
of
france
he
had
noticed
examined
recognized
a
countenance
surely
said
he
i
seen
that
man
before
but
he
was
paler
can
our
old
lodger
have
come
to
life
impossible
i
burned
up
my
directions
so
the
world
has
lost
thanks
to
me
the
secret
of
resuscitating
people
nevertheless
the
resemblance
is
striking
is
it
a
portrait
of
colonel
fougas
taken
from
life
in
no
for
photography
was
not
then
invented
but
possibly
it
a
photograph
copied
from
an
engraving
here
are
louis
xvi
and
marie
antoinette
reproduced
in
the
same
way
that
does
prove
that
robespierre
had
them
resuscitated
anyhow
i
had
an
unfortunate
encounter
he
took
a
step
toward
the
door
of
the
shop
to
reassure
himself
but
a
peculiar
reluctance
held
him
back
people
might
wonder
at
him
ask
him
questions
try
to
learn
the
reason
of
his
trouble
he
resumed
his
walk
at
a
brisk
pace
trying
to
reassure
himself
bah
it
an
hallucination
the
result
of
dwelling
too
much
on
one
idea
moreover
the
portrait
was
dressed
in
the
style
of
that
settles
the
question
he
reached
the
station
had
his
black
leather
trunk
checked
and
flung
himself
down
at
full
length
in
a
compartment
first
he
smoked
his
porcelain
pipe
but
his
two
neighbors
being
asleep
he
soon
followed
their
example
and
began
snoring
now
this
big
man
snores
had
something
about
them
you
could
have
fancied
yourself
listening
to
the
trumpets
of
the
judgment
day
what
shade
visited
him
in
this
hour
of
sleep
no
other
soul
has
ever
known
for
he
kept
his
dreams
to
himself
as
he
did
everything
that
was
his
but
between
two
stations
while
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
he
distinctly
felt
two
powerful
hands
pulling
at
his
feet
a
sensation
alas
too
well
known
and
one
which
called
up
the
ugliest
recollections
of
his
life
he
opened
his
eyes
in
terror
and
saw
the
man
of
the
photograph
in
the
costume
of
the
photograph
his
hair
stood
on
end
his
eyes
grew
as
big
as
saucers
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
flung
himself
headlong
between
the
seats
among
the
legs
of
his
neighbors
a
few
vigorous
kicks
brought
him
to
himself
he
got
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
looked
about
him
no
one
was
there
but
the
two
gentlemen
opposite
who
were
mechanically
lanching
their
last
kicks
into
the
empty
space
and
rubbing
their
eyes
with
their
arms
he
succeeded
in
awakening
them
and
asked
them
about
the
visitation
he
had
had
but
the
gentlemen
declared
they
had
seen
nothing
meiser
sadly
returned
to
his
own
thoughts
he
noticed
that
the
visions
appeared
terribly
real
this
idea
prevented
his
going
to
sleep
again
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
thought
he
the
colonel
ghost
will
break
my
nose
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
or
give
me
a
pair
of
black
eyes
a
little
later
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
breakfasted
very
hastily
that
morning
and
he
reflected
that
the
nightmare
had
perhaps
been
brought
about
by
such
dieting
he
got
off
at
the
next
and
called
for
soup
some
very
hot
vermicelli
was
brought
him
and
he
blew
into
his
bowl
like
a
dolphin
into
the
bosphorus
a
man
passed
before
him
without
jostling
him
without
saying
anything
to
him
without
even
seeing
him
and
nevertheless
the
bowl
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
rich
nicholas
meiser
the
vermicelli
poured
over
his
waistcoat
and
where
it
formed
an
elegant
fretwork
suggestive
of
the
architecture
of
the
saint
some
yellowish
threads
detached
from
the
mass
hung
in
stalactites
from
the
buttons
of
his
coat
the
vermicelli
stopped
on
the
outside
but
the
soup
penetrated
much
further
it
was
rather
warm
for
pleasure
an
egg
left
in
it
ten
minutes
would
have
been
boiled
hard
fatal
soup
which
not
only
distributed
itself
among
the
pockets
but
into
the
most
secret
sinuosities
of
the
man
himself
the
starting
bell
rang
the
waiter
collected
his
two
sous
and
meiser
got
into
the
cars
preceded
by
a
plaster
of
vermicelli
and
followed
by
a
little
thread
of
soup
which
was
running
down
the
calves
of
his
legs
and
all
of
this
because
he
had
seen
or
thought
he
had
seen
the
terrible
figure
of
colonel
fougas
eating
sandwiches
oh
how
long
the
trip
seemed
what
a
terrible
time
it
appeared
to
be
before
he
could
be
at
home
between
his
wife
catharine
and
his
servant
berbel
with
all
the
doors
safely
closed
his
two
companions
laughed
till
the
buttons
flew
people
laughed
in
the
compartment
to
the
right
of
him
and
in
the
compartment
to
the
left
of
him
as
fast
as
he
picked
off
the
vermicelli
little
spots
of
soup
saucily
congealed
and
seemed
quietly
laughing
how
hard
it
comes
to
a
great
millionnaire
to
amuse
people
who
do
not
possess
a
cent
he
did
not
get
off
again
until
they
reached
dantzic
he
did
not
even
put
his
nose
to
the
window
he
sucked
solitary
consolation
from
his
porcelain
pipe
on
which
leda
caressed
her
swan
and
smiled
not
wearisome
wearisome
journey
but
he
did
reach
home
nevertheless
it
was
eight
in
the
evening
the
old
domestic
was
waiting
with
ropes
to
sling
his
master
trunk
on
his
back
no
more
alarming
figures
no
more
mocking
laughs
the
history
of
the
soup
was
fallen
into
the
great
forgotten
like
one
of
heller
speeches
in
the
baggage
room
meiser
had
already
seized
the
handle
of
a
black
leather
trunk
when
at
the
other
end
he
saw
the
spectre
of
fougas
which
was
pulling
in
the
opposite
direction
and
seemed
inclined
to
dispute
possession
he
bristled
up
pulled
stronger
and
even
plunged
his
left
hand
into
the
pocket
where
the
revolver
was
lying
but
the
luminous
glance
of
the
colonel
fascinated
him
his
legs
trembled
he
fell
and
fancied
that
he
saw
fougas
and
the
black
trunk
rolling
over
each
other
when
he
came
to
his
old
servant
was
chafing
his
hands
the
trunk
already
had
the
slings
around
it
and
the
colonel
had
disappeared
the
domestic
swore
that
he
had
not
seen
anybody
and
that
he
had
himself
received
the
trunk
from
the
baggage
agent
own
hand
twenty
minutes
later
the
millionnaire
was
in
his
own
house
joyfully
rubbing
his
face
against
the
sharp
angles
of
his
wife
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
about
his
visions
for
frau
meiser
was
a
skeptic
in
her
own
way
it
was
she
who
spoke
to
him
about
fougas
a
whole
history
has
happened
to
me
said
she
would
you
believe
that
the
police
have
written
to
us
from
berlin
to
find
out
whether
our
uncle
left
us
a
mummy
and
when
and
how
long
we
kept
him
and
what
we
have
done
with
him
i
answered
telling
the
truth
and
adding
that
colonel
fougas
was
in
such
a
bad
condition
and
so
damaged
by
mites
that
we
sold
him
for
rags
what
object
can
the
police
have
in
troubling
themselves
about
our
affairs
meiser
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
let
talk
about
money
said
the
lady
the
president
of
the
bank
has
been
to
see
me
the
million
you
asked
him
for
for
is
ready
it
will
be
delivered
upon
your
signature
it
seems
that
they
had
a
deal
of
trouble
to
get
the
amount
in
specie
if
you
had
but
wanted
drafts
on
vienna
or
paris
you
would
have
put
them
at
their
ease
but
at
last
they
done
what
you
wanted
there
no
other
news
except
that
schmidt
the
merchant
has
killed
himself
he
had
to
pay
a
note
for
ten
thousand
thalers
and
did
have
half
the
amount
on
hand
he
came
to
ask
me
for
the
money
i
offered
him
ten
thousand
thalers
at
per
payable
in
ninety
days
with
a
first
mortgage
on
all
his
real
estate
the
fool
preferred
to
hang
himself
in
his
shop
everyone
to
his
taste
did
he
hang
himself
very
high
i
do
know
anything
about
that
why
because
one
might
get
a
piece
of
rope
cheap
and
we
greatly
in
want
of
some
my
poor
catharine
that
colonel
fougas
has
given
me
a
shiver
some
more
of
your
notions
come
to
supper
my
love
come
on
the
angular
baucis
conducted
her
philemon
into
a
large
and
beautiful
where
berbel
served
a
repast
worthy
of
the
gods
soup
with
little
balls
of
aniseeded
bread
with
black
sauce
stuffed
game
balls
cooked
in
lard
and
garnished
with
fried
potatoes
roast
hare
with
currant
jelly
deviled
crabs
salmon
from
the
vistula
jellies
and
fruit
tarts
six
bottles
of
selected
from
the
best
vintages
were
awaiting
in
their
silver
caps
the
master
kiss
but
the
lord
of
all
these
good
things
was
neither
hungry
nor
thirsty
he
ate
by
nibbles
and
drank
by
sips
all
the
time
expecting
a
grand
consummation
which
he
did
not
have
to
expect
along
a
formidable
rap
of
the
knocker
soon
resounded
through
the
house
nicholas
meiser
trembled
his
wife
tried
to
reassure
him
nothing
said
she
the
president
of
the
bank
told
me
that
he
was
coming
to
see
you
he
offers
to
pay
us
the
exchange
if
we
take
paper
instead
of
specie
it
about
money
sure
as
fate
cried
the
good
man
hell
itself
is
coming
to
see
us
at
the
same
instant
the
servant
rushed
into
the
room
crying
oh
sir
oh
madame
it
the
frenchman
of
the
three
coffins
jesus
mary
mother
of
god
fougas
saluted
them
and
said
do
disturb
yourselves
good
people
i
beg
of
you
we
a
little
matter
to
discuss
together
and
i

two
words

in
a
hurry
so

frau
meiser
more
rigid
and
more
emaciated
than
a
statue
opened
wide
her
toothless
mouth
terror
paralyzed
her
the
man
better
prepared
for
the
visit
of
the
phantom
cocked
his
revolver
under
the
table
and
took
aim
at
the
colonel
crying
retro
satanas
the
exorcism
and
the
pistol
missed
fire
together
meiser
was
not
at
all
discouraged
he
snapped
the
six
barrels
one
after
the
other
at
the
demon
who
stood
watching
him
do
it
not
one
went
off
what
devilish
game
is
that
you
playing
said
the
colonel
seating
himself
astride
a
chair
people
are
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
an
honest
man
visit
with
that
ceremony
meiser
flung
down
his
revolver
and
grovelled
like
a
beast
at
feet
his
wife
who
was
not
one
whit
more
tranquil
followed
him
they
joined
hands
and
the
fat
man
exclaimed

fougas
spurning
him
with
his
foot

i
want
nothing
but
the
money

robbed
me
of
meiser
kept
rolling
on
the
floor
but
his
scrawny
wife
was
already
on
her
feet
her
fists
on
her
hips
and
facing
fougas

cried
she
but

be
just

the
adventurers

themselves

first
place

hands

to
an
understanding
but
stamped
paper
stinks
in
my
nostrils
and
therefore
i
rather
settle
peaceably
herr
and
frau
meiser
repressed
their
first
emotion
they
distrusted
magistrates
as
do
all
people
without
clean
consciences
if
the
colonel
was
a
poor
devil
who
could
be
put
off
with
a
few
thalers
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
legal
proceedings
fougas
stated
the
case
to
them
with
entire
military
bluntness
he
proved
the
existence
of
his
right
said
that
he
had
had
his
identity
substantiated
at
fontainebleau
paris
and
berlin
cited
from
memory
two
or
three
passages
of
the
will
and
finished
by
declaring
that
the
prussian
government
in
conjunction
with
that
of
france
would
support
his
just
claims
if
necessary
you
understand
clearly
said
he
taking
meiser
by
the
button
of
his
coat
that
i
am
no
fox
depending
on
cunning
if
you
had
a
wrist
vigorous
enough
to
swing
a
good
sabre
we
take
the
field
against
each
other
and
i
play
you
for
the
amount
first
two
cuts
out
of
three
as
surely
as
that
soup
before
you
fortunately
monsieur
said
meiser
my
age
shields
me
from
all
brutality
you
would
not
wish
to
trample
under
foot
the
corpse
of
an
old
man
venerable
scoundrel
but
you
would
have
killed
me
like
a
dog
if
your
pistol
had
not
missed
fire
it
was
not
loaded
monsieur
colonel
it
was
not
anywhere
near
loaded
but
i
am
an
accommodating
man
and
we
can
come
to
terms
very
easily
i
do
owe
you
anything
and
moreover
there
prescription
but
after
all
how
much
do
you
want
he
has
had
his
say
now
it
my
turn
the
old
rascal
mate
softened
the
tone
of
her
voice
imagine
to
yourself
a
saw
licking
a
tree
before
biting
in
listen
claus
my
dear
listen
to
what
monsieur
colonel
fougas
has
to
say
you
see
that
he
is
reasonable
it
not
in
him
to
think
of
ruining
poor
people
like
us
oh
heavens
he
is
not
capable
of
it
he
has
such
a
noble
heart
such
a
disinterested
man
an
officer
worthy
of
the
great
napoleon
god
receive
his
soul
that
enough
old
lady
said
fougas
with
a
curt
gesture
which
cut
the
speech
off
in
the
middle
i
had
an
estimate
made
at
berlin
of
what
is
due
me
principal
and
interest
interest
cried
meiser
but
in
what
country
in
what
latitude
do
people
pay
interest
on
money
perhaps
it
may
sometimes
happen
in
business
but
between
friends
never
no
never
my
good
monsieur
colonel
what
would
my
good
uncle
who
is
now
gazing
upon
us
from
heaven
say
if
he
knew
that
you
were
claiming
interest
on
his
bequest
now
shut
up
nickle
interrupted
his
wife
monsieur
colonel
is
just
about
telling
you
himself
that
he
did
not
intend
to
be
understood
as
speaking
of
the
interest
why
in
the
name
of
great
guns
do
you
both
shut
up
you
confounded
magpies
here
i
am
dying
of
hunger
and
i
did
bring
my
nightcap
to
go
to
bed
here
either
now
here
the
upshot
of
the
matter
you
owe
me
a
great
deal
but
it
not
an
even
sum
there
are
fractions
in
it
and
i
go
in
for
clean
transactions
moreover
my
tastes
are
modest
enough
for
my
wife
and
myself
nothing
more
is
needed
than
to
provide
for
my
son
very
well
cried
meiser
i
charge
myself
with
the
education
of
the
little
fellow
now
during
the
dozen
days
since
i
again
became
a
citizen
of
the
world
there
is
one
word
that
i
heard
spoken
everywhere
at
paris
as
well
as
at
berlin
people
no
longer
speak
of
anything
but
millions
there
is
no
longer
any
talk
of
anything
else
and
everybody
mouth
is
full
of
millions
from
hearing
so
much
said
about
it
i
acquired
a
curiosity
to
know
what
it
is
go
fetch
me
out
a
million
and
i
give
you
quittance
if
you
want
to
reach
an
approximate
idea
of
the
piercing
cries
which
answered
him
go
to
the
des
at
the
breakfast
hour
of
the
birds
of
prey
and
try
to
pull
the
meat
out
of
their
beaks
fougas
stopped
his
ears
and
remained
inexorable
prayers
arguments
misrepresentations
flatteries
cringings
glanced
off
from
him
like
rain
from
a
zinc
roof
but
at
ten
at
night
when
he
had
concluded
that
all
concurrence
was
impossible
he
took
his
hat
good
evening
said
he
it
no
longer
a
million
that
i
must
have
but
two
millions
and
all
over
we
go
to
law
i
going
to
supper
he
was
on
the
staircase
when
frau
meiser
said
to
her
husband
call
him
back
and
give
him
his
million
are
you
a
fool
do
be
afraid
i
can
never
do
it
father
in
heaven
what
blockheads
men
are
monsieur
monsieur
fougas
monsieur
colonel
fougas
come
up
again
i
pray
you
we
consent
to
all
that
you
require
damnation
said
he
on
reëntering
you
ought
to
have
made
up
your
minds
sooner
but
after
all
let
see
the
money
frau
meiser
explained
to
him
with
her
tenderest
voice
that
poor
capitalists
like
themselves
were
not
in
the
habit
of
keeping
millions
under
their
own
lock
and
key
but
you
shall
lose
nothing
by
waiting
my
sweet
sir
you
shall
handle
the
amount
in
nice
white
silver
my
husband
will
sign
you
a
check
on
the
royal
bank
of
dantzic
but
said
the
unfortunate
meiser
he
signed
nevertheless
for
he
had
boundless
confidence
in
the
practical
ingenuity
of
catharine
the
old
lady
begged
fougas
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
dictated
to
him
a
receipt
for
two
millions
in
payment
of
all
demands
you
may
depend
that
she
did
not
forgot
a
word
of
the
legal
formulas
and
that
she
arranged
the
affair
in
due
form
according
to
the
prussian
code
the
receipt
written
throughout
in
the
colonel
hand
filled
three
large
pages
he
signed
the
instrument
with
a
flourish
and
received
in
exchange
the
signature
of
nicholas
which
he
knew
well
well
said
he
to
the
old
gentleman
you
certainly
not
such
an
arab
as
they
said
you
were
at
berlin
shake
hands
old
scamp
i
do
usually
shake
hands
with
any
but
honest
people
but
on
an
occasion
like
this
one
can
do
a
little
something
extra
do
it
double
monsieur
fougas
said
frau
meiser
humbly
will
you
not
join
us
in
this
modest
supper
gad
old
lady
it
not
a
thing
to
be
refused
my
supper
must
be
cold
at
the
inn
of
the
and
your
viands
smoking
on
their
chafing
dishes
have
already
caused
me
more
than
one
fit
of
distraction
besides
here
are
some
yellow
glass
flutes
on
which
fougas
will
not
be
at
all
reluctant
to
play
an
air
the
respectable
catharine
had
an
extra
plate
laid
and
ordered
berbel
to
go
to
bed
the
colonel
folded
up
father
meiser
million
rolled
it
carefully
among
a
pile
of
and
put
the
whole
into
the
little
which
his
dear
clementine
had
sent
him
the
clock
struck
eleven
at
eleven
fougas
began
to
see
everything
in
a
rosy
cloud
he
praised
the
rhine
wine
highly
and
thanked
the
meisers
for
their
hospitality
at
midnight
he
assured
them
of
his
highest
esteem
at
quarter
past
twelve
he
embraced
them
at
twelve
he
delivered
a
eulogy
on
the
illustrious
john
meiser
his
friend
and
benefactor
when
he
learned
that
john
meiser
had
died
in
that
house
he
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
tears
at
quarter
to
one
he
assumed
a
confidential
tone
and
spoke
of
his
son
whom
he
was
going
to
make
happy
and
of
the
betrothed
who
was
waiting
for
him
about
one
he
tasted
a
celebrated
port
wine
which
frau
meiser
had
herself
gone
to
bring
from
the
cellar
about
one
his
tongue
thickened
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
he
struggled
some
time
against
drunkenness
and
sleepiness
announced
that
he
was
going
to
describe
the
russian
campaign
muttered
the
name
of
the
emperor
and
slid
under
the
table
you
may
believe
me
if
you
will
said
frau
meiser
to
her
husband
this
is
not
a
man
who
has
come
into
our
house
it
the
devil
the
devil
if
not
would
i
have
advised
you
to
give
him
a
million
i
heard
a
voice
saying
to
me
you
do
not
obey
the
messenger
of
the
infernal
powers
you
will
both
die
this
very
night
it
was
on
account
of
that
that
i
called
him
up
stairs
ah
if
we
had
been
doing
business
with
a
man
i
would
have
told
you
to
contest
it
in
law
to
our
last
cent
as
you
please
so
you
still
making
sport
of
my
visions
forgive
me
claus
dear
i
was
a
fool
and
i
concluded
i
was
too
poor
innocent
perhaps
you
too
thought
this
was
colonel
fougas
certainly
as
if
it
were
possible
to
resuscitate
a
man
it
is
a
demon
i
tell
you
who
assumed
the
shape
of
the
colonel
to
rob
us
of
our
money
what
can
demons
do
with
money
build
cathedrals
to
be
sure
but
how
is
the
devil
to
be
recognized
when
he
is
disguised
first
by
his
but
this
one
has
boots
on
next
by
his
clipped
ear
bah
and
why
because
the
devil
ears
are
pointed
and
in
order
to
make
them
round
he
has
to
cut
them
meiser
stuck
his
head
under
the
table
and
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
it
certainly
the
devil
said
he
but
how
did
he
happen
to
let
himself
go
to
sleep
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
when
i
came
back
from
the
cellar
i
dropped
into
my
chamber
i
put
a
drop
of
holy
water
into
the
port
charm
against
charm
and
he
is
fallen
that
splendid
but
what
shall
we
do
with
him
now
that
we
have
him
in
our
power
what
is
done
with
demons
in
scripture
the
saviour
throws
them
into
the
sea
the
sea
is
a
long
way
from
here
but
you
big
baby
the
public
wells
are
just
by
and
what
will
be
said
when
the
body
is
found
nothing
at
all
will
be
found
and
even
the
check
that
we
signed
will
be
turned
into
tinder
ten
minutes
later
herr
and
frau
meiser
were
lugging
something
toward
the
public
wells
and
soon
dame
catharine
murmured
the
following
incantation
demon
child
of
hell
be
thou
accursed
demon
child
of
hell
be
thou
dashed
headlong
down
demon
child
of
hell
return
to
hell
a
dull
sound
the
sound
of
a
body
falling
into
water
terminated
the
ceremony
and
the
two
spouses
returned
to
their
domicil
with
the
satisfaction
that
always
follows
the
performance
of
a
duty
nicholas
said
to
himself
i
did
think
she
was
so
credulous
i
did
think
he
was
so
simple
thought
the
worthy
kettle
wedded
wife
of
claus
they
slept
the
sleep
of
innocence
oh
how
much
less
soft
their
pillows
would
have
seemed
if
fougas
had
gone
home
with
his
million
at
ten
the
next
morning
while
they
were
taking
their
coffee
and
buttered
rolls
the
president
of
the
bank
called
in
and
said
to
them
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
having
accepted
a
draft
on
paris
instead
of
a
million
in
specie
and
without
premium
too
that
young
frenchman
you
sent
to
us
is
a
little
brusque
but
very
lively
and
a
good
fellow
chapter
xviii
the
colonel
tries
to
relieve
himself
of
a
million
which
incumbers
him
fougas
had
left
paris
for
berlin
the
day
after
his
audience
he
took
three
days
to
make
the
trip
because
he
stopped
some
time
at
nancy
the
marshal
had
given
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
prefect
of
meurthe
who
received
him
very
politely
and
promised
to
aid
him
in
his
investigations
unfortunately
the
house
where
he
had
loved
clementine
pichon
was
no
longer
standing
the
authorities
had
demolished
it
in
in
cutting
a
street
through
it
is
certain
that
the
commissioners
had
not
demolished
the
family
with
the
house
but
a
new
difficulty
all
at
once
presented
itself
the
name
of
pichon
abounded
in
the
city
the
suburbs
and
the
department
among
this
multitude
of
pichons
fougas
did
not
know
which
one
to
hug
tired
of
hunting
and
eager
to
hasten
forward
on
the
road
to
fortune
he
left
this
note
for
the
commissioner
of
police
search
on
the
registers
of
personal
statistics
and
elsewhere
for
a
young
girl
named

up

happiness
depends
upon
it
on
reaching
berlin
the
colonel
found
that
his
reputation
had
preceded
him
the
note
from
the
minister
of
war
had
been
sent
to
the
prussian
government
through
the
french
legation
leon
renault
despite
his
grief
had
found
time
to
write
a
word
to
doctor
hirtz
the
papers
had
begun
to
talk
and
the
scientific
societies
to
bestir
themselves
the
prince
regent
even
had
not
disdained
to
ask
information
on
the
subject
from
his
physician
germany
is
a
queer
country
where
science
interests
the
very
princes
fougas
who
had
read
doctor
hirtz
letter
annexed
to
herr
will
thought
that
he
owed
some
acknowledgments
to
that
excellent
gentleman
he
made
a
call
upon
him
and
embraced
him
addressing
him
as
the
oracle
of
epidaurus
the
doctor
at
once
took
possession
of
him
had
his
baggage
brought
from
the
hotel
and
gave
him
the
best
chamber
in
his
house
up
to
the
day
of
the
month
the
colonel
was
cared
for
as
a
friend
and
exhibited
as
a
phenomenon
seven
photographers
disputed
the
possession
of
so
precious
a
sitter
the
cities
of
greece
did
no
more
for
our
poor
old
homer
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
wished
to
see
him
propriâ
and
begged
herr
hirtz
to
bring
him
to
the
palace
fougas
scratched
his
ear
a
little
and
intimated
that
a
soldier
ought
not
to
associate
with
the
enemy
seeming
to
think
himself
still
in
the
prince
is
a
distinguished
soldier
having
commanded
in
person
at
the
famous
siege
of
rastadt
he
took
pleasure
in
fougas
conversation
the
heroic
simplicity
of
the
young
soldier
charmed
him
he
paid
him
huge
compliments
and
said
that
the
emperor
of
france
was
very
fortunate
in
having
around
him
officers
of
so
much
merit
he
has
not
a
great
many
replied
the
colonel
if
there
were
but
four
or
five
hundred
of
my
stamp
your
europe
would
have
been
bagged
long
ago
this
answer
seemed
more
amusing
than
threatening
and
no
addition
was
immediately
made
to
the
available
portion
of
the
prussian
army
his
royal
highness
directly
informed
fougas
that
his
indemnity
had
been
fixed
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
that
he
could
receive
the
amount
at
the
treasury
whenever
he
should
find
it
agreeable
my
lord
replied
he
it
is
always
agreeable
to
pocket
the
money
of
an
enemy
a
foreigner
but
wait
i
am
not
a
to
plutus
give
me
back
the
rhine
and
posen
and
i
leave
you
your
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
are
you
dreaming
said
the
prince
laughing
the
rhine
and
posen
the
rhine
belongs
to
france
and
the
posen
to
poland
much
more
legitimately
than
this
money
to
me
but
so
it
is
with
great
lords
they
make
it
a
duty
to
pay
little
debts
and
a
point
of
honor
to
ignore
big
ones
the
prince
winced
a
little
and
all
the
faces
of
the
court
gave
a
sympathetic
twitch
it
was
discovered
that
fougas
had
evinced
bad
taste
in
letting
a
crumb
of
truth
fall
into
a
big
plateful
of
follies
but
a
pretty
little
viennese
baroness
who
was
at
the
presentation
was
much
more
charmed
with
his
appearance
than
scandalized
at
his
remarks
the
ladies
of
vienna
have
made
for
themselves
a
reputation
for
hospitality
which
they
always
attempt
to
support
even
when
they
are
away
from
their
native
land
the
baroness
of
marcomarcus
had
still
another
reason
for
getting
hold
of
the
colonel
for
two
or
three
years
she
had
as
a
matter
of
course
been
making
a
photographic
collection
of
celebrated
men
her
album
was
peopled
with
generals
statesmen
philosophers
and
pianists
who
had
given
their
portraits
to
her
after
writing
on
the
back
with
respects
of
there
were
to
be
found
there
several
roman
prelates
and
even
a
celebrated
cardinal
but
a
more
direct
envoy
from
the
other
world
was
still
wanting
she
wrote
fougas
then
a
note
full
of
impatience
and
curiosity
inviting
him
to
supper
fougas
who
was
going
to
start
for
dantzic
next
day
took
a
sheet
of
paper
embossed
with
a
great
eagle
and
set
to
work
to
excuse
himself
politely
he
feared
the
delicate
and
chivalrous
soul
that
an
evening
of
conversation
and
enjoyment
in
the
society
of
the
loveliest
women
of
germany
might
be
a
sort
of
moral
infidelity
to
the
recollection
of
clementine
he
accordingly
hunted
up
an
eligible
formula
of
address
and
wrote
too
indulgent
beauty
i
the
muse
dictated
nothing
more
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
writing
he
felt
rather
more
in
the
mood
for
supper
his
scruples
scattered
like
clouds
driven
before
a
brisk
north
east
wind
he
put
on
the
frogged
surtout
and
carried
his
reply
himself
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
out
to
supper
since
his
resuscitation
he
gave
evidence
of
a
good
appetite
and
got
moderately
drunk
but
not
as
much
so
as
usual
the
baroness
de
marcomarcus
astonished
at
his
high
spirits
and
inexhaustible
vivacity
kept
him
as
long
as
she
could
and
moreover
she
said
to
her
friends
on
showing
them
the
portrait
nothing
is
needed
but
these
french
officers
to
conquer
the
world
the
next
day
he
packed
a
black
leather
trunk
which
he
had
bought
at
paris
drew
his
money
from
the
treasury
and
set
out
for
dantzic
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
cars
because
he
had
been
out
to
supper
the
night
before
a
terrible
snoring
awoke
him
he
looked
around
for
the
snorer
and
not
finding
him
near
him
opened
the
door
into
the
adjoining
compartment
for
the
german
cars
are
much
larger
than
the
french
and
shook
a
fat
gentleman
who
seemed
to
have
a
whole
organ
playing
in
his
person
at
one
of
the
stations
he
drank
a
bottle
of
marsala
and
ate
a
couple
of
dozen
sandwiches
for
last
night
supper
seemed
to
have
hollowed
out
his
stomach
at
dantzic
he
rescued
his
black
trunk
from
the
hands
of
an
enormous
who
was
trying
to
take
possession
of
it
he
went
to
the
best
hotel
in
the
place
ordered
his
supper
and
hastened
to
meiser
house
his
friends
at
berlin
had
given
him
accounts
of
that
charming
family
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
deal
with
the
richest
and
most
avaricious
of
sharpers
that
was
why
he
assumed
the
cavalier
tone
that
may
have
seemed
strange
to
more
than
one
reader
in
the
preceding
chapter
unhappily
he
let
himself
become
a
little
too
human
as
soon
as
he
had
his
million
in
his
pocket
a
curiosity
to
investigate
the
long
yellow
bottles
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
came
near
doing
him
an
ugly
turn
his
reason
wandered
about
one
in
the
morning
if
i
am
to
believe
the
account
he
himself
gave
he
said
that
after
saying
good
night
to
the
excellent
people
who
had
treated
him
so
well
he
tumbled
into
a
large
and
deep
well
whose
rim
was
hardly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
street
and
ought
at
least
to
have
had
a
lamp
by
it
i
came
to
it
is
still
he
speaking
in
water
very
fresh
and
of
a
pleasant
taste
after
swimming
around
a
minute
or
two
looking
for
a
firm
place
to
take
hold
of
i
seized
a
big
rope
and
climbed
without
any
trouble
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
was
not
more
than
forty
feet
off
it
required
nothing
but
wrists
and
a
little
gymnastic
skill
and
was
not
much
of
a
feat
anyhow
on
getting
on
to
the
pavement
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
sort
of
night
watchman
who
was
bawling
the
hours
through
the
street
and
who
asked
me
insolently
what
i
was
doing
there
i
thrashed
him
for
his
impudence
and
the
gentle
exercise
did
me
good
as
it
set
my
blood
well
in
circulation
again
before
getting
back
to
the
inn
i
stopped
under
a
street
lamp
opened
my
and
saw
with
pleasure
that
my
million
was
not
wet
the
leather
was
thick
and
the
clasp
firm
moreover
i
had
enveloped
herr
meiser
check
in
a
bills
in
a
roll
as
fat
as
a
monk
these
surroundings
had
preserved
it
this
examination
being
made
he
went
home
went
to
bed
and
slept
with
his
fists
clenched
the
next
morning
he
received
on
getting
up
the
following
memoranda
which
came
from
the
nancy
police
clementine
pichon
aged
eighteen
minor
daughter
of
auguste
pichon
and
leonie
francelot
was
married
in
this
town
january
to
louis
antoine
langevin
profession
not
stated
the
name
of
langevin
is
as
rare
in
this
department
as
the
name
of
pichon
is
common
with
the
exception
of
the
hon
victor
langevin
counsellor
to
the
prefecture
at
nancy
there
is
only
known
langevin
pierre
usually
called
pierrot
miller
in
the
commune
of
vergaville
canton
of
dieuze
fougas
jumped
nearly
to
the
ceiling
crying
i
have
a
son
he
called
the
and
said
to
him
make
out
my
bill
and
send
my
baggage
to
the
depot
take
my
ticket
for
nancy
i
shall
not
stop
on
the
way
here
are
two
hundred
francs
with
which
i
want
you
to
drink
to
the
health
of
my
son
he
is
called
victor
after
me
he
is
counsellor
of
the
prefecture
i
rather
he
were
a
soldier
but
never
mind
ah
first
get
somebody
to
show
me
the
way
to
the
bank
i
must
go
and
get
a
million
for
him
as
there
is
no
direct
connection
between
dantzic
and
nancy
he
was
obliged
to
stop
at
berlin
hirtz
whom
he
met
accidentally
told
him
that
the
scientific
societies
of
the
city
were
preparing
an
immense
banquet
in
his
honor
but
he
declined
positively
it
not
said
he
that
i
despise
an
opportunity
to
drink
in
good
company
but
nature
has
spoken
her
voice
draws
me
on
the
sweetest
intoxication
to
all
rightly
constituted
hearts
is
that
of
paternal
love
to
prepare
his
dear
child
for
the
joy
of
a
return
so
little
expected
he
enclosed
his
million
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
victor
langevin
with
a
long
letter
which
closed
thus
a
father
blessing
is
more
precious
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
victor
fougas
the
infidelity
of
clementine
pichon
touched
his
a
little
but
he
soon
consoled
himself
for
it
at
least
thought
he
i
not
have
to
marry
an
old
woman
when
there
a
young
one
waiting
for
me
at
fontainebleau
and
moreover
my
son
has
a
name
and
a
very
presentable
name
fougas
would
be
a
great
deal
better
but
langevin
is
not
bad
he
arrived
on
the
of
september
at
six
in
the
evening
at
that
large
and
beautiful
but
somewhat
stupid
city
which
constitutes
the
versailles
of
lorraine
his
heart
was
beating
fit
to
burst
to
recuperate
his
energies
he
took
a
good
dinner
the
landlord
when
catechized
at
dessert
gave
him
the
very
best
accounts
of
victor
langevin
a
man
still
young
married
for
the
past
six
years
father
of
a
boy
and
a
girl
respected
in
the
neighborhood
and
prosperous
in
his
affairs
i
was
sure
of
it
said
fougas
he
poured
down
a
bumper
of
a
certain
from
the
black
forest
which
he
fancied
delicious
with
his
maccaroni
the
same
evening
langevin
related
to
his
wife
how
on
returning
from
the
club
at
ten
he
had
been
brutally
accosted
by
a
drunken
man
he
at
first
took
him
for
a
robber
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
but
the
man
contented
himself
with
embracing
him
and
then
ran
away
with
all
his
might
this
singular
accident
threw
the
two
spouses
into
a
series
of
conjectures
each
less
probable
than
the
preceding
but
as
they
were
both
young
and
had
been
married
barely
seven
years
they
soon
changed
the
subject
the
next
morning
fougas
laden
down
like
a
miller
ass
with
presented
himself
at
langevin
in
order
to
make
himself
welcome
to
his
two
grandchildren
he
had
skimmed
the
shop
of
the
celebrated
lebègue
the
boissier
of
nancy
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
for
him
asked
if
he
were
the
gentleman
her
master
expected
good
said
he
my
letter
has
come
yes
sir
yesterday
morning
and
your
baggage
i
left
it
at
the
hotel
monsieur
will
not
be
satisfied
at
that
your
room
is
ready
up
stairs
thanks
thanks
thanks
take
this
hundred
franc
note
for
the
good
news
oh
monsieur
it
was
not
worth
so
much
but
where
is
he
i
want
to
see
him
to
embrace
him
to
tell
him
he
dressing
monsieur
and
so
is
madame
and
the
children
my
dear
grandchildren
if
you
want
to
see
them
they
right
here
in
the
dining
room
if
i
want
to
open
the
door
right
away
he
discovered
that
the
little
boy
resembled
him
and
was
overjoyed
to
see
him
in
the
dress
of
an
artillerist
playing
with
a
sabre
his
pockets
were
soon
emptied
on
the
floor
and
the
two
children
at
the
sight
of
so
many
good
things
hung
about
his
neck
o
philosophers
cried
the
colonel
do
you
dare
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
voice
of
nature
a
pretty
little
lady
all
the
young
women
are
pretty
in
nancy
ran
in
at
the
joyous
cries
of
the
little
brood
my
cried
fougas
opening
his
arms
the
lady
of
the
house
modestly
recoiled
and
said
with
a
slight
smile
you
are
mistaken
sir
i
am
not
your
i
am
madame
langevin
what
a
fool
i
am
thought
the
colonel
here
i
was
going
to
tell
our
family
secrets
before
these
children
mind
your
manners
fougas
you
are
in
fine
society
where
the
ardor
of
the
sweetest
sentiments
is
hidden
under
the
icy
mask
of
indifference
be
seated
said
mme
langevin
i
hope
that
you
have
had
a
pleasant
journey
yes
madame
only
steam
seemed
too
slow
for
me
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
here
you
did
not
then
appreciate
that
i
was
fairly
burning
to
be
with
you
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
is
a
proof
that
reason
and
family
affection
have
made
themselves
heard
at
last
was
it
my
fault
that
family
ties
did
not
speak
effectually
sooner
well
after
all
the
main
thing
is
that
you
have
listened
to
them
we
will
exert
ourselves
to
prevent
your
finding
nancy
uninteresting
how
could
i
since
i
am
to
live
with
you
thank
you
our
house
will
be
yours
try
to
imagine
yourself
entirely
at
home
in
imagination
and
affection
too
madame
and
you
not
think
of
paris
again
paris
i
do
care
any
more
for
it
than
i
do
for
doomsday
i
forewarn
you
that
people
are
not
in
the
habit
of
fighting
duels
here
what
you
know
already
we
know
all
about
it
even
to
the
history
of
that
famous
supper
with
those
rather
volatile
ladies
how
the
devil
did
you
hear
of
that
but
that
time
believe
me
i
was
very
excusable
langevin
here
made
his
appearance
freshly
shaven
and
rubicund
a
fine
specimen
of
the
in
embryo
it
wonderful
thought
fougas
how
well
all
our
family
bear
their
years
one
would
call
that
chap
over
and
he
if
he
a
day
he
does
look
a
bit
like
me
by
the
way
he
takes
after
his
mother
my
dear
said
mme
langevin
here
a
tough
subject
who
promises
to
be
wiser
in
future
you
are
welcome
young
man
said
the
counsellor
offering
his
hand
to
fougas
this
reception
appeared
cold
to
our
poor
hero
he
had
been
dreaming
of
a
shower
of
kisses
and
tears
and
here
his
children
contented
themselves
with
offering
their
hands
my
chi
monsieur
said
he
to
langevin
there
is
one
person
still
needed
to
complete
our
reunion
a
few
mutual
wrongs
and
those
smoothed
over
by
time
ought
not
to
build
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
us
may
i
venture
to
request
the
favor
of
being
presented
to
your
mother
langevin
and
his
wife
opened
their
eyes
in
astonishment
how
monsieur
said
the
husband
paris
life
must
have
affected
your
memory
my
poor
mother
is
no
more
it
is
now
three
years
since
we
lost
her
the
good
fougas
burst
into
tears
forgive
me
said
he
i
did
know
it
poor
woman
i
do
understand
you
you
knew
my
mother
ingrate
why
you
an
amusing
fellow
but
your
parents
were
invited
to
the
funeral
were
they
not
whose
parents
your
father
and
mother
eh
what
this
you
cackling
to
me
about
my
mother
was
dead
before
yours
was
born
your
mother
dead
yes
certainly
in
what
was
it
your
mother
who
sent
you
here
monster
it
was
my
fatherly
heart
that
brought
me
fatherly
heart
why
then
you
not
young
jamin
who
has
been
cutting
up
didoes
in
the
capital
and
has
been
sent
to
nancy
to
go
through
the
agricultural
school
the
colonel
answered
with
the
voice
of
jupiter
tonans
i
am
fougas
very
well
if
nature
says
nothing
to
you
in
my
behalf
ungrateful
son
question
the
spirit
of
your
mother
upon
my
soul
sir
cried
the
counsellor
we
can
play
at
cross
purposes
a
good
while
sit
down
there
if
you
please
and
tell
me
your
business
marie
take
away
the
children
fougas
did
not
require
any
urging
he
detailed
the
romance
of
his
life
without
omitting
anything
but
with
many
delicate
touches
for
the
filial
ears
of
langevin
the
counsellor
heard
him
patiently
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
disinterestedness
monsieur
said
he
at
last
at
first
i
took
you
for
a
madman
but
now
i
remember
that
the
newspapers
have
contained
some
scraps
of
your
history
and
i
see
that
you
are
the
victim
of
a
mistake
i
am
not
years
old
but
my
mother
name
was
not
clementine
pichon
but
marie
herval
she
was
not
born
at
nancy
but
at
vannes
and
she
was
but
seven
years
old
in
nevertheless
i
am
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
ah
you
not
my
son
replied
fougas
angrily
very
well
so
much
the
worse
for
you
no
one
seems
to
want
a
father
of
the
name
of
fougas
as
for
sons
by
the
name
of
langevin
one
only
has
to
stoop
to
pick
them
up
i
know
where
to
find
one
who
is
not
a
counsellor
of
the
prefecture
it
is
true
and
who
does
not
put
on
a
laced
coat
to
go
to
mass
but
who
has
an
honest
and
simple
heart
and
is
named
pierre
just
like
me
but
i
beg
your
pardon
when
one
shows
gentlemen
the
door
one
ought
at
least
to
return
what
belongs
to
them
i
do
prevent
your
collecting
the
which
my
children
have
scattered
over
the
floor
yes
i
talking
about
with
a
vengeance
my
million
sir
what
million
your
brother
million
no
the
million
that
belongs
to
him
who
is
not
your
brother
to
clementine
son
my
dear
and
only
child
the
only
scion
of
my
race
pierre
langevin
called
pierrot
a
miller
at
vergaville
but
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
i
have
your
million
or
else
you
dare
to
deny
it
scoundrel
when
i
sent
it
to
you
by
mail
myself
possibly
you
sent
it
but
i
certainly
have
not
received
it
aha
defend
yourself
he
made
at
his
throat
and
perhaps
france
would
have
lost
a
counsellor
of
prefecture
that
day
if
the
servant
had
not
come
in
with
two
letters
in
her
hand
fougas
recognized
his
own
handwriting
and
the
berlin
postmark
tore
open
the
envelope
and
displayed
the
check
here
said
he
is
the
million
i
intended
for
you
if
you
had
seen
fit
to
be
my
son
now
it
too
late
for
you
to
retract
the
voice
of
nature
calls
me
to
vergaville
your
servant
sir
on
the
of
september
pierre
langevin
miller
at
vergaville
celebrated
the
marriage
of
cadet
langevin
his
second
son
the
family
was
numerous
respectable
and
in
comfortable
circumstances
first
there
was
the
grandfather
a
fine
hale
old
man
who
took
his
four
meals
a
day
and
doctored
his
little
ailings
with
the
wine
of
bar
or
thiaucourt
the
grandmother
catharine
had
been
pretty
in
her
day
and
a
little
frivolous
but
she
expiated
by
absolute
deafness
the
crime
of
having
listened
too
tenderly
to
gallants
pierre
langevin
alias
pierrot
alias
big
peter
after
having
sought
his
fortune
in
america
a
custom
becoming
quite
general
in
the
rural
districts
had
returned
to
the
village
in
pretty
much
the
condition
of
the
infant
saint
john
and
god
only
knows
how
many
jokes
were
perpetrated
over
his
ill
luck
the
people
of
lorraine
are
terrible
wags
and
if
you
are
not
fond
of
personal
jokes
i
advise
you
not
to
travel
in
their
neighborhood
big
peter
stung
to
the
quick
and
half
crazed
at
having
run
through
his
inheritance
borrowed
money
at
ten
per
bought
the
mill
at
vergaville
worked
like
a
in
heavy
land
and
repaid
his
capital
and
the
interest
fortune
who
owed
him
some
compensations
gave
him
pro
a
half
dozen
superb
workers
six
big
boys
whom
his
wife
presented
him
with
one
annually
as
regularly
as
every
year
nine
months
to
a
day
after
the
of
vergaville
claudine
otherwise
known
as
glaudine
presented
one
for
baptism
at
last
she
died
after
the
sixth
from
eating
four
huge
pieces
of
before
her
churching
big
peter
did
not
marry
again
having
concluded
that
he
had
workers
enough
and
he
continued
to
add
to
his
fortune
nicely
but
as
standing
jokes
last
a
long
time
in
villages
the
miller
comrades
still
spoke
to
him
about
those
famous
millions
which
he
did
not
bring
back
from
america
and
big
peter
grew
very
red
under
his
flour
just
as
he
used
to
in
his
earlier
days
on
the
of
september
then
he
married
his
second
son
to
a
good
big
woman
of
altroff
who
had
fat
and
blazing
cheeks
this
being
a
kind
of
beauty
much
affected
in
the
country
the
wedding
took
place
at
the
mill
because
the
bride
was
orphaned
of
father
and
mother
and
had
previously
lived
with
the
nuns
of
molsheim
a
messenger
came
and
told
pierre
langevin
that
a
gentleman
wearing
decorations
had
something
to
say
to
him
and
fougas
appeared
in
all
his
glory
my
good
sir
said
the
miller
i
am
far
from
being
in
a
mood
to
talk
business
as
we
just
took
a
good
pull
at
white
wine
before
mass
but
we
are
going
to
drink
some
red
wine
that
by
no
means
bad
at
dinner
and
if
your
heart
prompts
you
do
be
backward
the
table
is
a
long
one
we
can
talk
afterwards
you
do
say
no
then
that
yes
for
once
thought
fougas
i
am
not
mistaken
this
is
surely
the
voice
of
nature
i
would
have
liked
a
soldier
better
but
this
genial
rustic
so
comfortably
rounded
satisfies
my
heart
i
can
not
be
indebted
to
him
for
many
gratifications
of
my
pride
but
never
mind
i
am
sure
of
dinner
was
served
and
the
table
more
heavily
laden
with
viands
than
the
stomach
of
gargantua
big
peter
as
proud
of
his
big
family
as
of
his
little
fortune
made
the
colonel
stand
by
as
he
enumerated
his
children
and
fougas
was
joyful
at
learning
that
he
had
six
welcome
grandchildren
he
was
seated
at
the
right
of
a
little
stunted
old
woman
who
was
presented
to
him
as
the
grandmother
of
the
youngsters
heavens
how
changed
clementine
appeared
to
him
save
the
eyes
which
were
still
lively
and
sparkling
there
was
no
longer
anything
about
her
that
could
be
recognized
see
thought
fougas
what
i
would
have
been
like
if
the
worthy
john
meiser
had
not
desiccated
me
he
smiled
to
himself
on
regarding
grandfather
langevin
the
reputed
progenitor
of
this
numerous
family
poor
old
fellow
murmured
fougas
you
little
think
what
you
owe
to
me
they
dine
boisterously
at
village
weddings
this
is
an
abuse
which
i
sincerely
hope
civilization
will
never
reform
under
cover
of
the
noise
fougas
entered
into
conversation
or
thought
he
did
with
his
neighbor
clementine
he
said
to
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
her
nose
too
and
responded
yes
monsieur
my
heart
has
not
deceived
me
then
you
are
indeed
my
clementine
yes
monsieur
and
you
have
recognized
me
noble
and
excellent
woman
yes
monsieur
but
how
did
you
conceal
your
emotion
so
well
how
strong
women
are
i
fall
from
the
skies
into
the
midst
of
your
peaceful
existence
and
you
see
me
without
moving
a
muscle
yes
monsieur
have
you
forgiven
me
for
a
seeming
injury
for
which
destiny
alone
is
responsible
yes
monsieur
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
what
a
charming
family
you
have
about
you
this
good
pierre
who
almost
opened
his
arms
on
seeing
me
approach
is
my
son
is
he
not
yes
monsieur
rejoice
he
shall
be
rich
he
already
has
happiness
i
bring
him
fortune
his
portion
shall
be
a
million
oh
clementine
what
a
commotion
there
will
be
in
this
simple
assembly
when
i
raise
my
voice
and
say
to
my
son
this
million
is
for
you
is
it
a
good
time
now
shall
i
speak
shall
i
tell
all
yes
monsieur
fougas
immediately
arose
and
requested
silence
the
people
thought
he
was
going
to
sing
a
song
and
all
kept
quiet
pierre
langevin
said
he
with
emphasis
i
have
come
back
from
the
other
world
and
brought
you
a
million
if
big
peter
did
not
want
to
get
angry
he
at
least
got
red
and
the
joke
seemed
to
him
in
bad
taste
but
when
fougas
announced
that
he
had
loved
the
grandmother
in
her
youth
grandfather
langevin
no
longer
hesitated
to
fling
a
bottle
at
his
head
the
colonel
son
his
splendid
grandchildren
and
even
the
bride
all
jumped
up
in
high
dudgeon
and
there
was
a
very
pretty
scrimmage
indeed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fougas
did
not
get
the
upper
hand
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
injure
some
of
his
family
paternal
affection
robbed
him
of
three
quarters
of
his
power
but
having
learned
during
the
clamor
that
clementine
was
called
catharine
and
that
pierre
langevin
was
born
in
he
resumed
the
offensive
blacked
three
eyes
broke
an
arm
mashed
two
noses
knocked
in
four
dozen
teeth
and
regained
his
carriage
with
all
the
honors
of
war
devil
take
the
children
said
he
while
riding
in
a
toward
the
avricourt
station
if
i
have
a
son
i
wish
he
may
find
me
chapter
xix
he
seeks
and
bestows
the
hand
of
clementine
on
the
fifth
of
september
at
ten
in
the
morning
leon
renault
emaciated
dejected
and
scarcely
recognizable
was
at
the
feet
of
clementine
sambucco
in
her
aunt
parlor
there
were
flowers
on
the
mantel
and
flowers
in
all
the
vases
two
great
burglar
sunbeams
broke
through
the
open
windows
a
million
of
little
bluish
atoms
were
playing
in
the
light
crossing
each
other
and
getting
fantastically
mixed
up
like
the
ideas
in
a
volume
of
alfred
houssaye
in
the
garden
the
apples
were
falling
the
peaches
were
ripe
the
hornets
were
ploughing
broad
deep
furrows
in
the
pears
the
and
were
in
blossom
and
to
crown
all
a
great
mass
of
heliotropes
trained
over
the
left
window
was
flourishing
in
all
its
beauty
the
sun
had
given
all
the
grapes
in
the
arbor
a
tint
of
golden
bronze
and
the
great
yucca
on
the
lawn
shaken
by
the
wind
like
a
chinese
hat
noiselessly
clashed
its
silver
bells
but
the
son
of
renault
was
more
pale
and
haggard
than
the
white
lilac
sprays
more
blighted
than
the
leaves
on
the
old
his
heart
was
without
joy
and
without
hope
like
the
currant
bushes
without
leaves
and
without
fruit
to
be
exiled
from
his
native
land
to
have
lived
three
years
in
an
inhospitable
climate
to
have
passed
so
many
days
in
deep
mines
so
many
nights
over
an
earthenware
stove
in
the
midst
of
an
infinity
of
bugs
and
a
multiplicity
of
serfs
and
to
see
himself
set
aside
for
a
colonel
whom
he
himself
had
brought
to
life
by
soaking
him
in
water
all
men
are
subject
to
disappointments
but
surely
never
had
one
encountered
a
misfortune
so
unforeseen
and
so
extraordinary
leon
knew
that
earth
is
not
a
valley
flowing
with
chocolate
and
soup
la
he
knew
the
list
of
the
renowned
unfortunates
beginning
with
abel
slain
in
the
garden
of
paradise
and
ending
with
rubens
assassinated
in
the
gallery
of
the
louvre
at
paris
but
history
which
seldom
instructs
us
never
consoles
us
the
poor
engineer
in
vain
repeated
to
himself
that
a
thousand
others
had
been
supplanted
on
the
day
before
marriage
and
a
hundred
thousand
on
the
day
after
melancholy
was
stronger
than
reason
and
three
or
four
soft
locks
were
beginning
to
whiten
about
his
temples
clementine
said
he
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
men
in
refusing
me
the
hand
which
you
have
promised
you
condemn
me
to
agony
a
hundred
times
worse
than
death
alas
what
would
you
have
me
become
without
you
i
must
live
alone
for
i
love
you
too
well
to
marry
another
for
four
long
years
all
my
affections
all
my
thoughts
have
been
centred
upon
you
i
have
become
accustomed
to
regard
other
women
as
inferior
beings
unworthy
of
attracting
the
interest
of
a
man
i
will
not
speak
to
you
of
the
efforts
i
have
made
to
deserve
you
they
brought
their
reward
in
themselves
and
i
was
already
too
happy
in
working
and
suffering
for
you
but
see
the
misery
in
which
your
desertion
has
left
me
a
sailor
thrown
upon
a
desert
island
has
less
to
deplore
than
i
i
will
be
forced
to
live
near
you
to
witness
the
happiness
of
another
to
see
you
pass
my
windows
upon
the
arm
of
my
rival
ah
death
would
be
more
endurable
than
this
constant
agony
but
i
have
not
even
the
right
to
die
my
poor
old
parents
have
already
sorrows
enough
what
would
it
be
great
god
if
i
were
to
condemn
them
to
bear
the
loss
of
their
son
this
complaint
punctuated
with
sighs
and
tears
lacerated
the
heart
of
clementine
the
poor
child
wept
too
for
she
loved
leon
with
her
whole
soul
but
she
was
interdicted
from
telling
him
so
more
than
once
on
seeing
him
half
dying
before
her
she
felt
tempted
to
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
but
the
recollection
of
fougas
paralyzed
all
her
tender
impulses
my
poor
friend
said
she
you
judge
me
very
wrongfully
if
you
think
me
insensible
to
your
sufferings
i
have
known
you
thoroughly
leon
and
that
too
since
my
very
childhood
i
know
all
that
there
is
in
you
of
devotion
delicacy
and
precious
and
noble
virtues
since
the
time
when
you
carried
me
in
your
arms
to
the
poor
and
put
a
penny
in
my
hand
to
teach
me
to
give
alms
i
have
never
heard
benevolence
spoken
of
without
involuntarily
thinking
of
you
when
you
whipped
a
boy
twice
your
size
for
taking
away
my
doll
i
felt
that
courage
was
noble
and
that
a
woman
would
be
happy
in
being
able
to
lean
on
a
brave
man
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
you
do
since
that
time
has
only
redoubled
my
esteem
and
my
sympathy
believe
me
that
it
is
neither
from
wickedness
or
ingratitude
that
i
make
you
suffer
now
alas
i
no
longer
belong
to
myself
i
am
under
external
control
i
am
like
those
automatons
that
move
without
knowing
why
yes
i
feel
an
impulse
within
me
more
powerful
than
my
self
control
and
it
is
the
will
of
another
that
leads
me
if
i
could
but
be
sure
that
you
will
be
happy
but
no
this
man
before
whom
you
immolate
me
will
never
know
the
worth
of
a
soul
as
delicate
as
yours
he
is
a
brute
a
a
drunkard
i
beseech
you
leon
remember
that
he
has
a
right
to
my
unreserved
respect
respect
for
him
and
why
i
ask
of
you
in
heaven
name
what
you
find
respectable
in
the
character
of
mister
fougas
his
age
he
is
younger
than
i
his
talents
he
never
shows
them
anywhere
but
at
the
table
his
education
it
lovely
his
virtues
know
what
is
to
be
thought
of
his
refinement
and
gratitude
i
have
respected
him
leon
since
i
first
saw
him
in
his
coffin
it
is
a
sentiment
stronger
than
all
else
i
can
not
explain
it
i
can
but
submit
to
it
very
well
respect
him
as
much
as
you
please
yield
to
the
superstition
that
enchains
you
see
in
him
a
miraculous
being
consecrated
rescued
from
the
grip
of
death
to
accomplish
something
great
on
earth
but
this
itself
oh
my
dear
clementine
is
a
barrier
between
you
and
him
if
fougas
is
outside
of
the
conditions
of
humanity
if
he
is
a
phenomenon
a
being
apart
a
hero
a
demigod
a
fetich
you
can
not
seriously
think
of
becoming
his
wife
as
for
me
i
am
but
a
man
like
others
born
to
work
to
suffer
and
to
love
i
love
you
love
me
scoundrel
cried
fougas
opening
the
door
clementine
uttered
a
cry
leon
sprung
up
quickly
but
the
colonel
had
already
seized
him
by
the
most
practicable
part
of
his
nankeen
suit
before
he
had
even
time
to
think
of
a
single
word
in
reply
the
engineer
was
lifted
up
balanced
like
an
atom
in
one
of
the
sunbeams
and
flung
into
the
very
midst
of
the
heliotropes
poor
leon
poor
heliotropes
in
less
than
a
second
the
young
man
was
on
his
feet
he
dusted
the
earth
from
his
knees
and
elbows
approached
the
window
and
said
in
a
calm
but
resolute
voice
mister
colonel
i
sincerely
regret
having
brought
you
back
to
life
but
possibly
the
folly
of
which
i
have
been
guilty
is
not
irreparable
i
hope
soon
to
have
an
opportunity
to
find
out
if
it
be
as
for
you
mademoiselle
i
love
you
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
himself
at
the
young
feet
on
the
very
cushion
which
still
bore
the
impression
left
by
leon
mlle
virginie
sambucco
attracted
by
the
noise
came
down
stairs
like
an
avalanche
and
heard
the
following
conversation
idol
of
a
great
soul
fougas
returns
to
thee
like
the
eagle
to
his
eyrie
i
have
long
traversed
the
world
in
pursuit
of
rank
fortune
and
family
which
i
was
burning
to
lay
at
thy
feet
fortune
has
obeyed
me
as
a
slave
she
knows
in
what
school
i
learned
the
art
of
controlling
her
i
have
gone
through
paris
and
germany
like
a
victorious
meteor
led
by
its
star
i
have
everywhere
associated
as
an
equal
with
the
powers
of
earth
and
made
the
trumpet
of
truth
resound
in
the
halls
of
kings
i
have
put
my
foot
on
the
throat
of
greedy
avarice
and
snatched
from
him
a
part
at
least
of
the
treasures
which
he
had
stolen
from
honor
one
only
blessing
is
denied
me
the
son
i
hoped
to
see
has
escaped
the
of
paternal
love
neither
have
i
found
the
ancient
object
of
my
first
affections
but
what
matters
it
i
shall
feel
the
want
of
nothing
if
you
fill
for
me
the
place
of
all
what
do
we
wait
for
now
are
you
deaf
to
the
voice
of
happiness
which
calls
you
let
us
go
to
the
temple
of
the
laws
then
you
shall
follow
me
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
a
priest
shall
consecrate
our
bonds
and
we
will
go
through
life
leaning
on
one
another
i
like
the
oak
sustaining
weakness
thou
like
the
graceful
ivy
ornamenting
the

clementine
remained
a
few
moments
without
answering
as
if
stunned
by
the
colonel
vehement
rhetoric
monsieur
fougas
she
said
to
him
i
have
always
obeyed
you
i
promise
to
obey
you
all
my
life
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
marry
poor
leon
i
will
renounce
him
i
love
him
devotedly
nevertheless
and
a
single
word
from
him
arouses
more
emotion
in
my
heart
than
all
the
fine
things
you
have
said
to
me
good
very
good
cried
the
aunt
as
for
me
sir
although
you
have
never
done
me
the
honor
to
consult
me
i
will
tell
you
my
opinion
my
niece
is
not
at
all
the
woman
to
suit
you
were
you
richer
than
de
rothschild
and
more
illustrious
than
the
duke
of
malakoff
i
would
not
advise
clementine
to
marry
you
and
why
chaste
minerva
because
you
would
love
her
fifteen
days
and
then
at
the
first
sound
of
cannon
be
off
to
the
wars
you
would
abandon
her
sir
just
as
you
did
that
unhappy
clementine
whose
misfortunes
have
been
recounted
to
us
zounds
lady
aunt
i
advise
you
to
bestow
your
pity
on
three
months
after
leipzic
she
married
a
fellow
named
langevin
at
nancy
what
do

i
say
that
she
married
a
military
commissary
named

town

is
strange

outrageous
but

clementine
ear
and
said
is
she
subject
to
these
attacks
one
would
suppose
that
the
poor
old
girl
had
lost
her
head
but
virginie
sambucco
had
already
opened
a
little
rosewood
secretary
her
unerring
glance
discovered
in
a
file
of
papers
a
sheet
yellow
with
age
i
got
it
said
she
with
a
cry
of
joy

of
nancy
married
june
to
joseph
langevin
military
is
it
surely
she
monsieur
dare
to
say
it
is
she
well
but
how
do
you
happen
to
have
my
family
papers
poor
clementine
and
you
accuse
her
of
unfaithfulness
you
do
not
understand
then
that
you
had
been
taken
for
dead
that
she
supposed
herself
a
widow
without
having
been
a
wife
that
it
all
right
it
all
right
i
forgive
her
where
is
she
i
want
to
see
her
to
embrace
her
to
tell
her
she
is
dead
monsieur
she
died
three
months
after
she
was
married
ah
the
devil
in
giving
birth
to
a
daughter
where
is
my
daughter
i
rather
have
had
a
son
but
never
mind
where
is
she
i
want
to
see
her
to
embrace
her
to
tell
her
alas
she
is
no
more
but
i
can
conduct
you
to
her
tomb
but
how
the
devil
did
you
know
her
because
she
married
my
brother
without
my
consent
but
never
mind
at
least
she
left
some
children
did
she
only
one
a
son
he
is
my
grandson
a
daughter
never
mind
she
is
my
granddaughter
i
rather
have
had
a
grandson
but
where
is
she
i
want
to
see
her
to
embrace
her
to
tell
her
embrace
away
monsieur
her
name
is
clementine
after
her
grandmother
and
there
she
is
she
that
accounts
for
the
resemblance
but
then
i
ca
marry
her
never
mind
clementine
come
to
my
arms
embrace
your
grandfather
the
poor
child
had
not
been
able
entirely
to
comprehend
this
rapid
conversation
from
which
events
had
been
falling
like
tiles
upon
the
head
of
the
colonel
she
had
always
heard
langevin
spoken
of
as
her
maternal
grandfather
and
now
she
seemed
to
hear
that
her
mother
was
the
daughter
of
fougas
but
she
knew
at
the
first
words
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
to
marry
the
colonel
and
that
she
would
soon
be
married
to
leon
renault
it
was
therefore
from
an
impulse
of
joy
and
gratitude
that
she
flung
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
man
ah
monsieur
said
she
i
have
always
loved
and
respected
you
like
a
grandfather
and
i
my
poor
child
have
always
behaved
myself
like
an
old
beast
all
men
are
brutes
and
all
women
are
angels
you
divined
with
the
delicate
instinct
of
your
sex
that
you
owed
me
respect
and
i
fool
that
i
am
did
divine
anything
at
all
whew
without
the
venerable
aunt
there
i
have
made
a
pretty
piece
of
work
no
said
the
aunt
you
would
have
found
out
the
truth
in
going
over
our
family
papers
would
that
i
could
have
seen
them
and
nothing
more
just
to
think
that
i
went
off
to
seek
my
heirs
in
the
department
of
meurthe
when
i
had
left
my
family
in
fontainebleau
imbecile
bah

never
mind

tell
him

him
out
of
the
window

hold
on
it

about

at
once
and
make
amends
for
my
folly
you
shall
get
married
when
you
want
to
the
two

he
ran
to

and
gothon
who
saw
him
coming
ran
down
to
shut
him
out
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourself
said
she
to
act
this
way
with
them
as
brought
you
to
life
again
ah
if
it
had
to
be
done
over

to
hunt
you
up
what
have
you
been
at
again
since
morning
fougas
gave
her
a
twirl
on
her
feet
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
engineer
leon
had
heard
the
sound
of
a
quarrel
and
on
seeing
the
colonel
excited
with
flashing
eyes
he
expected
some
brutal
aggression
and
did
not
wait
for
the
first
blow
a
struggle
took
place
in
the
passage
amid
the
cries
of
gothon
renault
and
the
poor
old
lady
who
was
screaming
murder
leon
wrestled
kicked
and
from
time
to
time
launched
a
vigorous
blow
into
the
body
of
his
antagonist
he
had
to
succumb
nevertheless
the
colonel
finished
by
upsetting
him
on
the
ground
and
holding
him
there
then
he
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
said
to
him
ah
you
naughty
boy
now
i
pretty
sure
to
make
you
listen
to
me
i
am
clementine
grandfather
and
i
give
her
to
you
in
marriage
and
you
can
have
the
wedding
if
you
want
to
do
you
hear
now
get
up
and
do
you
punch
me
in
the
stomach
any
more
it
would
be
almost
parricide
mlle
sambucco
and
clementine
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
general
stupefaction
they
completed
the
recital
of
fougas
who
had
gotten
himself
pretty
badly
mixed
up
in
the
genealogy
leon
seconds
appeared
in
their
turn
they
had
not
found
the
enemy
in
the
hotel
where
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
and
came
to
give
an
account
of
their
mission
a
tableau
of
perfect
happiness
met
their
astonished
gaze
and
leon
invited
them
to
the

a

sky
mlle
virginie
sambucco
has
the
honor
to
announce
to
you
the
marriage
of
mlle
clementine

her
niece
to

mme

have
the
honor
to
announce
to
you
the
marriage
of
leon

their
son
to

clementine

and
invite
you
to
be
present
at
the
nuptial
benediction
which
will
be
given
them
on
the
of
september
in
the
church
of
saint
maxcence
in
their
parish
at
eleven
precisely
fougas
absolutely
insisted
that
his
name
should
figure
on
the
cards
they
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
cure
him
of
this
whim
mme
renault
lectured
him
two
full
hours
she
told
him
that
in
the
eyes
of
society
as
well
as
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
clementine
was
the
granddaughter
of
langevin
that
moreover
langevin
had
acted
very
liberally
in
legitimizing
by
marriage
a
daughter
that
was
not
his
own
finally
that
the
publication
of
such
a
family
secret
would
be
an
outrage
against
the
sanctity
of
the
grave
and
would
tarnish
the
memory
of
poor
clementine
pichon
the
colonel
answered
with
the
warmth
of
a
young
man
and
the
obstinacy
of
an
old
one
nature
has
her
rights
they
are
anterior
to
the
conventions
of
society
and
a
thousand
times
more
exalted
the
honor
of
her
i
called
my
ægle
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
and
i
would
cleave
the
soul
of
any
rash
being
who
should
attempt
to
tarnish
it
in
yielding
to
the
ardor
of
my
vows
she
but
conformed
to
the
custom
of
a
great
epoch
when
the
uncertainty
of
life
and
the
constant
existence
of
war
simplified
all
formalities
and
in
conclusion
i
do
not
wish
that
my
grandchildren
yet
to
be
born
should
be
ignorant
that
the
source
of
their
blood
is
in
the
veins
of
fougas
your
langevin
is
but
an
intruder
who
covertly
slipped
into
my
family
a
commissary
it
almost
a
sutler
i
spurn
under
foot
the
ashes
of
langevin
his
obstinacy
would
not
yield
to
the
arguments
of
mme
renault
but
it
succumbed
to
the
entreaties
of
clementine
the
young
creole
twisted
him
around
her
finger
with
irresistible
grace
my
good
grandpa
this
my
pretty
little
grandpa
that
my
old
baby
of
a
grandpa
we
send
you
off
to
college
if
you
not
reasonable
she
used
to
seat
herself
familiarly
on
fougas
knee
and
give
him
little
love
pats
on
the
cheeks
the
colonel
would
assume
the
gruffest
possible
voice
and
then
his
heart
would
overflow
with
tenderness
and
he
would
cry
like
a
child
these
familiarities
added
nothing
to
the
happiness
of
leon
renault
i
even
think
that
they
slightly
tempered
his
joy
yet
he
certainly
did
not
doubt
either
the
love
of
his
betrothed
or
the
honor
of
fougas
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
between
a
grandfather
and
his
granddaughter
such
little
liberties
are
natural
and
proper
and
could
justly
offend
no
one
but
the
situation
was
so
new
and
so
unusual
that
he
needed
a
little
time
to
adapt
his
feelings
to
it
and
forget
his
chagrin
this
grandfather
for
whom
he
had
paid
francs
whose
ear
he
had
broken
for
whom
he
had
bought
a
in
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
this
ancestor
younger
than
himself
whom
he
had
seen
drunk
whom
he
had
found
agreeable
then
dangerous
then
insupportable
this
venerable
head
of
the
family
who
had
begun
by
demanding
clementine
hand
and
ended
by
pitching
his
future
grandson
into
the
heliotropes
could
not
all
at
once
obtain
unmingled
respect
and
unreserved
affection
and
mme
renault
exhorted
their
son
to
submission
and
deference
they
represented
fougas
to
him
as
a
relative
who
ought
to
be
treated
with
consideration
a
few
days
of
patience
said
the
good
mother
he
will
not
stay
with
us
long
he
is
a
soldier
and
ca
live
out
of
the
army
any
better
than
a
fish
out
of
water
but
leon
parents
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
held
a
bitter
remembrance
of
so
many
pangs
and
mortifications
fougas
had
been
the
scourge
of
the
family
the
wounds
which
he
had
made
could
not
heal
over
in
a
day
even
gothon
bore
him
ill
will
without
confessing
it
she
heaved
great
sighs
while
preparing
for
the
wedding
festivities
at
mlle
sambucco
ah
my
poor
célestin
said
she
to
her
acolyte
what
a
little
rascal
of
a
grandfather
we
going
to
have
to
be
sure
the
only
person
who
was
perfectly
at
ease
was
fougas
he
had
passed
the
sponge
over
his
pranks
out
of
all
the
evil
he
had
done
he
retained
no
ill
will
against
any
one
very
paternal
with
clementine
very
gracious
with
and
mme
renault
he
evinced
for
leon
the
most
frank
and
cordial
friendship
my
dear
boy
said
he
to
him
i
have
studied
you
i
know
you
and
i
love
you
thoroughly
you
deserve
to
be
happy
and
you
shall
be
you
shall
soon
see
that
in
buying
me
for
napoleons
you
make
a
bad
bargain
if
gratitude
were
banished
from
the
universe
it
would
find
a
last
abiding
place
in
the
heart
of
fougas
three
days
before
the
marriage
bonnivet
informed
the
family
that
the
colonel
had
come
into
his
office
to
ask
for
a
conference
about
the
contract
he
had
scarcely
cast
his
eyes
on
the
sheet
of
stamped
paper
when
rrrrip
it
was
in
pieces
in
the
fireplace
mister
he
said
do
me
the
honor
of
beginning
your
over
again
the
granddaughter
of
fougas
does
not
marry
with
an
annuity
of
eight
thousand
francs
nature
and
friendship
give
her
a
million
here
it
is
thereupon
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
bank
check
for
a
million
paced
the
study
proudly
making
his
boots
creak
and
threw
a
note
on
a
clerk
desk
crying
in
his
clearest
tones
children
of
the
law
here
something
to
drink
the
health
of
the
emperor
and
the
grand
army
with
the
renault
family
strongly
remonstrated
against
this
liberality
clementine
on
being
told
of
it
by
her
intended
had
a
long
discussion
in
the
presence
of
mlle
sambucco
with
the
young
and
terrible
grandpapa
she
tried
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
was
but
years
old
that
he
would
be
getting
married
some
day
and
that
his
property
belonged
to
his
future
family
i
do
not
wish
said
she
that
your
children
should
accuse
me
of
having
robbed
them
keep
your
millions
for
my
little
uncles
and
aunts
but
for
once
fougas
would
not
yield
an
inch
are
you
mocking
me
he
said
to
clementine
do
you
think
that
i
will
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
marrying
now
i
do
not
promise
you
to
live
like
a
monk
of
la
trappe
but
at
my
age
a
man
put
together
like
i
am
can
find
enough
to
talk
to
around
the
garrisons
without
marrying
anybody
mars
does
not
borrow
the
torch
of
hymen
to
light
the
little
aberrations
of
venus
why
does
man
ever
tie
himself
in
matrimonial
bonds
for
the
sake
of
being
a
father
i
am
one
already
in
the
comparative
degree
and
in
a
year
if
our
brave
leon
does
a
man
part
i
shall
assume
the
superlative
that
a
lovely
position
for
a
trooper
years
old
at
or
fifty
i
shall
be
at
seventy
the
french
language
has
no
more
words
to
express
what
i
shall
become
but
we
can
order
one
from
those
babblers
of
the
academy
are
you
afraid
that
i
want
for
anything
in
my
old
age
i
have
my
pay
in
the
first
place
and
my
officer
cross
when
i
reach
the
years
of
anchises
or
nestor
i
will
have
my
add
to
all
this
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
from
the
king
of
prussia
and
you
shall
see
that
i
have
not
only
bread
but
all
essential
fixings
in
the
bargain
up
to
the
close
of
my
career
moreover
i
have
a
perpetual
grant
for
which
your
husband
has
paid
in
advance
in
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
with
all
these
possessions
and
simple
tastes
one
is
sure
not
to
eat
up
resources
willing
or
unwilling
they
had
to
concede
all
he
required
and
accept
his
million
this
act
of
generosity
made
a
great
commotion
in
the
town
and
the
name
of
fougas
already
celebrated
in
so
many
ways
acquired
a
new
prestige
the
signature
of
the
bride
was
attested
by
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
and
the
illustrious
karl
nibor
who
but
a
few
days
before
had
been
elected
to
the
academy
of
sciences
leon
modestly
retained
the
old
friends
whom
he
had
long
since
chosen
audret
the
architect
and
bonnivet
the
notary
the
mayor
was
brilliant
in
his
new
scarf
the
addressed
to
the
young
couple
an
affecting
allocution
on
the
inexhaustible
goodness
of
providence
which
still
occasionally
performs
a
miracle
for
the
benefit
of
true
christians
fougas
who
had
not
discharged
his
religious
duties
since
soaked
two
handkerchiefs
with
tears
one

always
part
from
those
nearest

a
pantagruelic
feast
presided
over
by
mlle
virginie
sambucco
in
a

of

followed
immediately
upon
the
marriage
ceremony
persons
were
present
at
this
family
among
others
the
new
colonel
of
the
and
du
marnet
who
was
almost
well
of
his
wound
fougas
took
up
his
napkin
with
a
certain
anxiety
he
hoped
that
the
marshal
had
brought
his
brevet
as
brigadier
general
his
expressive
countenance
manifested
lively
disappointment
at
the
empty
plate
the
duke
of
solferino
who
had
been
seated
at
the
place
of
honor
noticed
this
physiognomical
display
and
said
aloud
do
be
impatient
my
old
comrade
i
know
what
you
miss
it
was
not
my
fault
that
the
was
not
complete
the
minister
of
war
was
out
when
i
dropped
in
on
my
way
here
i
was
told
however
at
the
department
that
your
affair
was
kept
in
suspense
by
a
technical
question
but
that
you
would
receive
a
letter
from
the
office
within
hours
devil
take
the
documents
cried
fougas
they
got
them
all
from
my
down
to
the
copy
of
my
brevet
colonel
commission
you
find
out
that
they
want
a
certificate
of
vaccination
or
some
such
shinplaster
oh
patience
young
man
you
time
enough
to
wait
it
not
such
a
case
as
mine
without
the
italian
campaign
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
snatch
the
baton
they
would
have
slit
my
ear
like
a
condemned
horse
under
the
empty
pretext
that
i
was
years
old
you
not
yet
and
you
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
brigadier
the
emperor
promised
it
to
you
before
me
in
four
or
five
years
from
now
you
have
the
gold
stars
unless
some
bad
luck
interferes
after
which
you
need
nothing
but
the
command
of
an
army
and
a
successful
campaign
to
make
you
marshal
of
france
and
senator
which
may
nothing
prevent
yes
responded
fougas
i
reach
it
not
only
because
i
am
the
youngest
of
all
the
officers
of
my
grade
and
because
i
have
been
in
the
mightiest
of
wars
and
followed
the
lessons
of
the
master
of
fields
but
above
all
because
destiny
has
marked
me
with
her
sign
why
did
the
bullets
spare
me
in
more
than
twenty
battles
why
have
i
sped
over
oceans
of
steel
and
fire
without
my
skin
receiving
a
scratch
it
is
because
i
have
a
star
as
had
his
was
the
grander
it
is
true
but
it
went
out
at
helena
while
mine
is
burning
in
heaven
still
if
doctor
nibor
resuscitated
me
with
a
few
drops
of
warm
water
it
was
because
my
destiny
was
not
yet
accomplished
if
the
will
of
the
french
people
has
the
imperial
throne
it
was
to
furnish
me
a
series
of
opportunities
for
my
valor
during
the
conquest
of
europe
which
we
are
about
to
recommence
and
me
too
i
shall
be
duke
or
prince
in
less
than
ten
years
and
why
not
one
might
try
to
be
at
on
the
day
when
crowns
are
distributed
in
that
case
i
will
adopt
clementine
oldest
son
we
will
call
him
pierre
victor
and
he
shall
succeed
me
on
the
throne
just
as
louis
xv
succeeded
his
grandfather
louis
as
he
was
finishing
this
wonderful
speech
a
entered
the
dining
room
asked
for
colonel
fougas
and
handed
him
a
letter
from
the
minister
of
war
gad
cried
the
marshal
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
your
promotion
arrive
at
the
end
of
such
a
discourse
for
once
we
would
prostrate
ourselves
before
your
star
the
magi
kings
would
be
nowhere
compared
with
us
read
it
yourself
said
he
to
the
marshal
holding
out
to
him
the
great
sheet
of
paper
but
no
i
have
always
looked
death
in
the
face
i
will
not
turn
my
eyes
away
from
this
paper
thunder
if
it
is
killing
me
colonel
in
preparing
the
imperial
decree
which
elevated
you
to
the
rank
of
brigadier
general
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
insurmountable
obstacle
your
certificate
of
birth
it
appears
from
that
document
that
you
were
born
in
and
that
you
have
already
passed
your
seventieth
year
now
the
limit
of
age
being
fixed
at
sixty
years
for
colonels
for
brigadier
generals
and
for
generals
of
division
i
find
myself
under
the
absolute
necessity
of
placing
you
upon
the
retired
list
with
the
rank
of
colonel
i
know
monsieur
how
little
this
measure
is
justified
by
your
apparent
age
and
i
sincerely
regret
that
france
should
be
deprived
of
the
services
of
a
man
of
your
capacity
and
merit
moreover
it
is
certain
that
an
exception
in
your
favor
would
arouse
no
dissatisfaction
in
the
army
and
would
meet
with
nothing
but
sympathetic
approval
but
the
law
is
express
and
the
emperor
himself
can
not
violate
or
elude
it
the
impossibility
resulting
from
it
is
so
absolute
that
if
in
your
ardor
to
serve
the
country
you
were
willing
to
lay
aside
your
epaulettes
for
the
sake
of
beginning
upon
a
new
career
your
enlistment
could
not
be
received
in
a
single
regiment
of
the
army
it
is
fortunate
monsieur
that
the
government
has
been
able
to
furnish
you
the
means
of
subsistence
in
obtaining
from
his
royal
highness
the
regent
of
prussia
the
indemnity
which
was
due
you
for
there
is
not
even
an
office
in
the
civil
administration
in
which
even
by
special
favor
a
man
seventy
years
old
could
be
placed
you
will
very
justly
object
that
the
laws
and
regulations
now
in
force
date
from
a
period
when
experiments
on
the
revivification
of
men
had
not
yet
met
with
favorable
results
but
the
law
is
made
for
the
mass
of
mankind
and
can
not
take
any
account
of
exceptions
undoubtedly
attention
would
be
directed
to
its
amendment
if
cases
of
resuscitation
were
to
present
themselves
in
sufficient
number
accept
a
gloomy
silence
succeeded
the
reading
the
mene
tekel
of
the
oriental
legends
could
not
have
more
completely
produced
the
effect
of
thunderbolts
the
was
still
there
standing
in
the
position
of
the
soldier
without
arms
awaiting
fougas
receipt
the
colonel
called
for
pen
and
ink
signed
the
paper
gave
the
and
said
to
him
with
emotion
you
are
happy
you
are
no
one
prevents
you
from
serving
the
country
well
added
he
turning
toward
the
marshal
what
do
you
say
to
that
what
would
you
have
me
say
my
poor
old
boy
it
breaks
me
all
up
there
no
use
in
arguing
against
the
law
it
express
the
stupid
thing
on
our
parts
was
not
to
think
of
it
sooner
but
who
the
devil
would
have
thought
of
the
retired
list
in
the
presence
of
such
a
fellow
as
you
are
the
two
colonels
avowed
that
such
an
objection
would
never
have
entered
their
heads
now
that
it
had
been
suggested
however
they
could
not
see
what
to
rebut
it
with
neither
of
them
would
have
been
able
to
enlist
fougas
as
a
private
soldier
despite
his
ability
his
physical
strength
and
his
appearance
of
being
years
old
if
some
one
would
only
kill
me
cried
fougas
i
ca
set
myself
to
weighing
sugar
or
planting
cabbages
it
was
in
the
career
of
arms
that
i
took
my
first
steps
i
must
continue
in
it
or
die
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
become
take

in
some
foreign

never
the
fate
of
moreau
is
still
before
my
eyes
oh
fortune
what
have
i
done
to
thee
that
i
should
be
dashed
so
low
when
thou
wast
preparing
to
raise
me
so
high
clementine
tried
to
console
him
with
soothing
words
you
shall
live

said
she
we
will
find
you
a
pretty
little
wife

you
can
rear
your
children
in
your

moments
you
can
write
the

of

you
have
done
you
will
want
for

youth

all
that
makes
up
the
happiness
of
men
is
yours
why
then
should
you
not
be
happy
leon
and
his
parents
talked
with
him
in
the
same
way
everything
appertaining
to
the
festive
occasion
was
forgotten
in
the
presence
of
an
affliction
so
real
and
a
dejection
so
profound
he
roused
himself
little
by
little
and
even
sang
at
dessert
a
little
song
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
occasion
here
a
health
to
these
fortunate
lovers
who
on
this
thrice
blessed
day
have
singed
with
the
torch
of
chaste
hymen
the
wings
with
which
cupid
doth
stray
and
now
little
volatile
you
must
keep
yourself
quiet
at
home
enchained
there
by
this
happy
marriage
where
genius
and
beauty
are
one
he
make
it
henceforth
his
endeavor
to
keep
pleasure
in
loyalty
power
forgetting
his
naughty
old
habit
of
roaming
from
flower
to
flower
and
clementine
makes
the
task
easy
for
roses
spring
up
at
her
smile
from
thence
the
young
rascal
can
steal
them
as
well
as
in
venus
isle
the
verses
were
loudly
applauded
but
the
poor
colonel
smiled
sadly
talked
but
little
and
did
not
get
fuddled
at
all
the
man
with
the
broken
ear
could
not
at
all
console
himself
for
having
a
slit
ear
he
took
part
in
the
various
diversions
of
the
day
but
was
no
longer
the
brilliant
companion
who
had
inspired
everything
with
his
impetuous
gayety
the
marshal
buttonholed
him
during
the
evening
and
said
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
thinking
of
the
old
messmates
who
were
happy
enough
to
fall
at
waterloo
with
their
faces
toward
the
enemy
that
old
fool
of
a
dutchman
who
preserved
me
for
posterity
did
me
but
a
sorry
service
i
tell
you
leblanc
a
man
ought
to
live
in
his
own
day
later
is
too
late
oh
pshaw
fougas
do
talk
nonsense
there
nothing
desperate
in
the
case
devil
take
it
i
go
to
see
the
emperor
the
matter
shall
be
looked
into
it
will
all
be
set
straight
men
like
you
why
france
has
got
them
by
the
dozen
that
she
should
fling
them
among
the
soiled
linen
thanks
you
a
good
old
boy
and
a
true
one
there
were
five
hundred
thousand
of
us
of
the
same
same
sort
in
there
are
but
two
left

rather
one
and
a
half
about
ten
in
the
evening
rollon
du
marnet
and
fougas
accompanied
the
marshal
to
the
cars
fougas
embraced
his
comrade
and
promised
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
after
the
train
left
the
three
colonels
went
back
to
town
on
foot
in
passing
rollon
house
fougas
said
to
his
successor
you
not
very
hospitable
you
do
even
offer
us
a
pony
of
that
good
andaye
brandy
i
thought
you
were
not
in
drinking
trim
said
rollon
you
take
anything
in
your
coffee
or
afterwards
but
come
up
my
thirst
has
come
back
with
a
vengeance
that
a
good
symptom
he
drank
in
a
melancholy
fashion
and
scarcely
wet
his
lips
in
his
glass
he
stopped
a
little
while
before
the
flag
took
hold
of
the
staff
spread
out
the
silk
counted
the
holes
that
cannon
balls
and
bullets
had
made
in
it
and
could
not
repress
his
tears
positively
said
he
the
brandy
has
taken
me
in
the
throat
i
not
a
man
good
evening
gentlemen
hold
on
we
go
back
with
you
oh
my
hotel
is
only
a
step
it
all
the
same
but
what
your
idea
in
staying
at
a
hotel
when
you
have
two
houses
in
town
at
your
service
on
the
strength
of
that
i
am
going
to
move
the
next
morning
about
eleven
the
happy
leon
was
at
his
toilet
when
a
telegram
was
brought
to
him
he
opened
it
without
noticing
that
it
was
addressed
to
fougas
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
here
is
the
laconic
message
which
brought
him
so
much
pleasure
to
colonel
fougas
fontainebleau
just
left
the
emperor
you
to
be
brevet
brigadier

something
better
turns
up

necessary

leblanc
leon
dressed
himself
ran
to
the
hotel
of
the
blue
sundial
and
found
fougas
dead
in
his
bed
it
is
said
in
fontainebleau
that
nibor
made
an
autopsy
and
found
that
serious
disorders
had
been
produced
by
desiccation
some
people
are
nevertheless
satisfied
that
fougas
committed
suicide
it
is

that

lasted
a

it
is
simple
justice
to
say
that
he
made
good
use
of
his
time
he
reposes
in
the
spot
which
young

him
his
