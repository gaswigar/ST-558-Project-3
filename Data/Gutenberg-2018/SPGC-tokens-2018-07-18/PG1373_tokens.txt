study
of
a
woman
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
katharine
prescott
wormeley
dedication
to
the
marquis
di
negro
study
of
a
woman
the
marquise
de
listomere
is
one
of
those
young
women
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
spirit
of
the
restoration
she
has
principles
she
fasts
takes
the
sacrament
and
goes
to
balls
and
operas
very
elegantly
dressed
her
confessor
permits
her
to
combine
the
mundane
with
sanctity
always
in
conformity
with
the
church
and
with
the
world
she
presents
a
living
image
of
the
present
day
which
seems
to
have
taken
the
word
legality
for
its
motto
the
conduct
of
the
marquise
shows
precisely
enough
religious
devotion
to
attain
under
a
new
maintenon
to
the
gloomy
piety
of
the
last
days
of
louis
and
enough
worldliness
to
adopt
the
habits
of
gallantry
of
the
first
years
of
that
reign
should
it
ever
be
revived
at
the
present
moment
she
is
strictly
virtuous
from
policy
possibly
from
inclination
married
for
the
last
seven
years
to
the
marquis
de
listomere
one
of
those
deputies
who
expect
a
peerage
she
may
also
consider
that
such
conduct
will
promote
the
ambitions
of
her
family
some
women
are
reserving
their
opinion
of
her
until
the
moment
when
monsieur
de
listomere
becomes
a
peer
of
france
when
she
herself
will
be
years
of
age
a
period
of
life
when
most
women
discover
that
they
are
the
dupes
of
social
laws
the
marquis
is
a
rather
insignificant
man
he
stands
well
at
court
his
good
qualities
are
as
negative
as
his
defects
the
former
can
no
more
make
him
a
reputation
for
virtue
than
the
latter
can
give
him
the
sort
of
glamor
cast
by
vice
as
deputy
he
never
speaks
but
he
votes
right
he
behaves
in
his
own
home
as
he
does
in
the
chamber
consequently
he
is
held
to
be
one
of
the
best
husbands
in
france
though
not
susceptible
of
lively
interest
he
never
scolds
unless
to
be
sure
he
is
kept
waiting
his
friends
have
named
him
dull
weather
aptly
enough
for
there
is
neither
clear
light
nor
total
darkness
about
him
he
is
like
all
the
ministers
who
have
succeeded
one
another
in
france
since
the
charter
a
woman
with
principles
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
it
is
certainly
a
great
thing
for
a
virtuous
woman
to
have
married
a
man
incapable
of
follies
occasionally
some
fops
have
been
sufficiently
impertinent
to
press
the
hand
of
the
marquise
while
dancing
with
her
they
gained
nothing
in
return
but
contemptuous
glances
all
were
made
to
feel
the
shock
of
that
insulting
indifference
which
like
a
spring
frost
destroys
the
germs
of
flattering
hopes
beaux
wits
and
fops
men
whose
sentiments
are
fed
by
sucking
their
canes
those
of
a
great
name
or
a
great
fame
those
of
the
highest
or
the
lowest
rank
in
her
own
world
they
all
blanch
before
her
she
has
conquered
the
right
to
converse
as
long
and
as
often
as
she
chooses
with
the
men
who
seem
to
her
agreeable
without
being
entered
on
the
tablets
of
gossip
certain
coquettish
women
are
capable
of
following
a
plan
of
this
kind
for
seven
years
in
order
to
gratify
their
fancies
later
but
to
suppose
any
such
reservations
in
the
marquise
de
listomere
would
be
to
calumniate
her
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
this
phoenix
she
talks
well
i
know
how
to
listen
consequently
i
please
her
and
i
go
to
her
parties
that
in
fact
was
the
object
of
my
ambition
neither
plain
nor
pretty
madame
de
listomere
has
white
teeth
a
dazzling
skin
and
very
red
lips
she
is
tall
and
her
foot
is
small
and
slender
and
she
does
not
put
it
forth
her
eyes
far
from
being
dulled
like
those
of
so
many
parisian
women
have
a
gentle
glow
which
becomes
quite
magical
if
by
chance
she
is
animated
a
soul
is
then
divined
behind
that
rather
indefinite
form
if
she
takes
an
interest
in
the
conversation
she
displays
a
grace
which
is
otherwise
buried
beneath
the
precautions
of
cold
demeanor
and
then
she
is
charming
she
does
not
seek
success
but
she
obtains
it
we
find
that
for
which
we
do
not
seek
that
saying
is
so
often
true
that
some
day
it
will
be
turned
into
a
proverb
it
is
in
fact
the
moral
of
this
adventure
which
i
should
not
allow
myself
to
tell
if
it
were
not
echoing
at
the
present
moment
through
all
the
salons
of
paris
the
marquise
de
listomere
danced
about
a
month
ago
with
a
young
man
as
modest
as
he
is
lively
full
of
good
qualities
but
exhibiting
chiefly
his
defects
he
is
ardent
but
he
laughs
at
ardor
he
has
talent
and
he
hides
it
he
plays
the
learned
man
with
aristocrats
and
the
aristocrat
with
learned
men
eugene
de
rastignac
is
one
of
those
extremely
clever
young
men
who
try
all
things
and
seem
to
sound
others
to
discover
what
the
future
has
in
store
while
awaiting
the
age
of
ambition
he
scoffs
at
everything
he
has
grace
and
originality
two
rare
qualities
because
the
one
is
apt
to
exclude
the
other
on
this
occasion
he
talked
for
nearly
half
an
hour
with
madame
de
listomere
without
any
predetermined
idea
of
pleasing
her
as
they
followed
the
caprices
of
conversation
which
beginning
with
the
opera
of
guillaume
tell
had
reached
the
topic
of
the
duties
of
women
he
looked
at
the
marquise
more
than
once
in
a
manner
that
embarrassed
her
then
he
left
her
and
did
not
speak
to
her
again
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
danced
played
at
ecarte
lost
some
money
and
went
home
to
bed
i
have
the
honor
to
assure
you
that
the
affair
happened
precisely
thus
i
add
nothing
and
i
suppress
nothing
the
next
morning
rastignac
woke
late
and
stayed
in
bed
giving
himself
up
to
one
of
those
matutinal
reveries
in
the
course
of
which
a
young
man
glides
like
a
sylph
under
many
a
silken
or
cashmere
or
cotton
drapery
the
heavier
the
body
from
its
weight
of
sleep
the
more
active
the
mind
rastignac
finally
got
up
without
yawning
as
many
persons
are
apt
to
do
he
rang
for
his
valet
ordered
tea
and
drank
immoderately
of
it
when
it
came
which
will
not
seem
extraordinary
to
persons
who
like
tea
but
to
explain
the
circumstance
to
others
who
regard
that
beverage
as
a
panacea
for
indigestion
i
will
add
that
eugene
was
by
this
time
writing
letters
he
was
comfortably
seated
with
his
feet
more
frequently
on
the
andirons
than
properly
on
the
rug
ah
to
have
one
feet
on
the
polished
bar
which
connects
the
two
griffins
of
a
fender
and
to
think
of
our
love
in
our
is
so
delightful
a
thing
that
i
deeply
regret
the
fact
of
having
neither
mistress
nor
fender
nor
the
first
letter
which
eugene
wrote
was
soon
finished
he
folded
and
sealed
it
and
laid
it
before
him
without
adding
the
address
the
second
letter
begun
at
eleven
was
not
finished
till
the
four
pages
were
closely
filled
that
woman
keeps
running
in
my
head
he
muttered
as
he
folded
this
second
epistle
and
laid
it
before
him
intending
to
direct
it
as
soon
as
he
had
ended
his
involuntary
revery
he
crossed
the
two
flaps
of
his
flowered
put
his
feet
on
a
stool
slipped
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
red
cashmere
trousers
and
lay
back
in
a
delightful
with
side
wings
the
seat
and
back
of
which
described
an
angle
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
degrees
he
stopped
drinking
tea
and
remained
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gilded
hand
which
formed
the
knob
of
his
shovel
but
without
seeing
either
hand
or
shovel
he
ceased
even
to
poke
the
fire
a
vast
mistake
is
it
one
of
our
greatest
pleasures
to
play
with
the
fire
when
we
think
of
women
our
minds
find
speeches
in
those
tiny
blue
flames
which
suddenly
dart
up
and
babble
on
the
hearth
we
interpret
as
we
please
the
strong
harsh
tones
of
a
burgundian
here
i
must
pause
to
put
before
all
ignorant
persons
an
explanation
of
that
word
derived
from
a
very
distinguished
etymologist
who
wishes
his
name
kept
secret
burgundian
is
the
name
given
since
the
reign
of
charles
to
those
noisy
detonations
the
result
of
which
is
to
fling
upon
the
carpet
or
the
clothes
a
little
coal
or
ember
the
trifling
nucleus
of
a
conflagration
heat
or
fire
releases
they
say
a
bubble
of
air
left
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
by
a
gnawing
worm
inde
amor
inde
burgundus
we
tremble
when
we
see
the
structure
we
had
so
carefully
erected
between
the
logs
rolling
down
like
an
avalanche
oh
to
build
and
stir
and
play
with
fire
when
we
love
is
the
material
development
of
our
thoughts
it
was
at
this
moment
that
i
entered
the
room
rastignac
gave
a
jump
and
said
ah
there
you
are
dear
horace
how
long
have
you
been
here
just
come
ah
he
took
up
the
two
letters
directed
them
and
rang
for
his
servant
take
these
he
said
and
deliver
them
joseph
departed
without
a
word
admirable
servant
we
began
to
talk
of
the
expedition
to
morea
to
which
i
was
anxious
to
be
appointed
as
physician
eugene
remarked
that
i
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
if
i
left
paris
we
then
conversed
on
various
matters
and
i
think
you
will
be
glad
if
i
suppress
the
conversation
when
the
marquise
de
listomere
rose
about
two
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
her
caroline
gave
her
a
letter
which
she
read
while
caroline
was
doing
her
hair
an
imprudence
which
many
young
women
are
thoughtless
enough
to
commit
dear
angel
of
love
said
the
letter
treasure
of
my
life
and
happiness
at
these
words
the
marquise
was
about
to
fling
the
letter
in
the
fire
but
there
came
into
her
head
a
fancy
which
all
virtuous
women
will
readily
understand
to
see
how
a
man
who
began
a
letter
in
that
style
could
possibly
end
it
when
she
had
turned
the
fourth
page
and
read
it
she
let
her
arms
drop
like
a
person
much
fatigued
caroline
go
and
ask
who
left
this
letter
madame
i
received
it
myself
from
the
valet
of
monsieur
le
baron
de
rastignac
after
that
there
was
silence
for
some
time
does
madame
intend
to
dress
asked
caroline
at
last
no
he
is
certainly
a
most
impertinent
man
reflected
the
marquise
i
request
all
women
to
imagine
for
themselves
the
reflections
of
which
this
was
the
first
madame
de
listomere
ended
hers
by
a
formal
decision
to
forbid
her
porter
to
admit
monsieur
de
rastignac
and
to
show
him
herself
something
more
than
disdain
when
she
met
him
in
society
for
his
insolence
far
surpassed
that
of
other
men
which
the
marquise
had
ended
by
overlooking
at
first
she
thought
of
keeping
the
letter
but
on
second
thoughts
she
burned
it
madame
had
just
received
such
a
fine
and
she
read
it
said
caroline
to
the
housemaid
i
should
never
have
thought
that
of
madame
replied
the
other
quite
surprised
that
evening
madame
de
listomere
went
to
a
party
at
the
marquis
de
beauseant
where
rastignac
would
probably
betake
himself
it
was
saturday
the
marquis
de
beauseant
was
in
some
way
a
connection
of
monsieur
de
rastignac
and
the
young
man
was
not
likely
to
miss
coming
by
two
in
the
morning
madame
de
listomere
who
had
gone
there
solely
for
the
purpose
of
crushing
eugene
by
her
coldness
discovered
that
she
was
waiting
in
vain
a
brilliant
man
stendhal
has
given
the
fantastic
name
of
crystallization
to
the
process
which
madame
de
listomere
thoughts
went
through
before
during
and
after
this
evening
four
days
later
eugene
was
scolding
his
valet
ah
ca
joseph
i
shall
soon
have
to
send
you
away
my
lad
what
is
it
monsieur
you
do
nothing
but
make
mistakes
where
did
you
carry
those
letters
i
gave
you
saturday
joseph
became
stolid
like
a
statue
in
some
cathedral
porch
he
stood
motionless
entirely
absorbed
in
the
labors
of
imagination
suddenly
he
smiled
idiotically
and
said
monsieur
one
was
for
the
marquise
de
listomere
the
other
was
for
monsieur
lawyer
you
are
certain
of
what
you
say
joseph
was
speechless
i
saw
plainly
that
i
must
interfere
as
i
happened
to
be
again
in
eugene
apartment
joseph
is
right
i
said
eugene
turned
and
looked
at
me
i
read
the
addresses
quite
involuntarily
and
and
interrupted
eugene
one
of
them
was
for
madame
de
nucingen
no
by
all
the
devils
it
was
not
consequently
i
supposed
my
dear
fellow
that
your
heart
was
wandering
from
the
rue
to
the
rue
eugene
struck
his
forehead
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
began
to
laugh
by
which
joseph
perceived
that
the
blame
was
not
on
him
now
there
are
certain
morals
to
this
tale
on
which
young
men
had
better
reflect
eugene
thought
it
would
be
amusing
to
make
madame
de
listomere
laugh
at
the
blunder
which
had
made
her
the
recipient
of
a
which
was
not
intended
for
her
he
did
not
call
on
madame
de
listomere
for
several
days
after
the
adventure
thus
allowing
the
thoughts
of
that
virtuous
young
woman
to
crystallize
there
were
other
mistakes
which
i
will
here
pass
over
in
silence
in
order
to
give
the
ladies
the
pleasure
of
deducing
them
ex
professo
to
those
who
are
unable
to
guess
them
eugene
at
last
went
to
call
upon
the
marquise
but
on
attempting
to
pass
into
the
house
the
porter
stopped
him
saying
that
madame
la
marquise
was
out
as
he
was
getting
back
into
his
carriage
the
marquis
de
listomere
came
home
come
in
eugene
he
said
my
wife
is
at
home
pray
excuse
the
marquis
a
husband
however
good
he
may
be
never
attains
perfection
as
they
went
up
the
staircase
rastignac
perceived
at
least
a
dozen
blunders
in
worldly
wisdom
which
had
unaccountably
slipped
into
this
page
of
the
glorious
book
of
his
life
when
madame
de
listomere
saw
her
husband
ushering
in
eugene
she
could
not
help
blushing
the
young
baron
saw
that
sudden
color
if
the
most
man
retains
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
a
certain
conceit
of
which
he
never
rids
himself
any
more
than
a
woman
ever
rids
herself
of
coquetry
who
shall
blame
eugene
if
he
did
say
softly
in
his
own
mind
what
that
fortress
too
so
thinking
he
posed
in
his
cravat
young
men
may
not
be
grasping
but
they
like
to
get
a
new
coin
in
their
collection
monsieur
de
listomere
seized
the
gazette
de
france
which
he
saw
on
the
mantelpiece
and
carried
it
to
a
window
to
obtain
by
journalistic
help
an
opinion
of
his
own
on
the
state
of
france
a
woman
even
a
prude
is
never
long
embarrassed
however
difficult
may
be
the
position
in
which
she
finds
herself
she
seems
always
to
have
on
hand
the
which
our
mother
eve
bequeathed
to
her
consequently
when
eugene
interpreting
in
favor
of
his
vanity
the
refusal
to
admit
him
bowed
to
madame
de
listomere
in
a
tolerably
intentional
manner
she
veiled
her
thoughts
behind
one
of
those
feminine
smiles
which
are
more
impenetrable
than
the
words
of
a
king
are
you
unwell
madame
you
denied
yourself
to
visitors
i
am
well
monsieur
perhaps
you
were
going
out
not
at
all
you
expected
some
one
no
one
if
my
visit
is
indiscreet
you
must
blame
monsieur
le
marquis
i
had
already
accepted
your
mysterious
denial
when
he
himself
came
up
and
introduced
me
into
the
sanctuary
monsieur
de
listomere
is
not
in
my
confidence
on
this
point
it
is
not
always
prudent
to
put
a
husband
in
possession
of
certain
secrets
the
firm
and
gentle
tones
in
which
the
marquise
said
these
words
and
the
imposing
glance
which
she
cast
upon
rastignac
made
him
aware
that
he
had
posed
in
his
cravat
a
trifle
prematurely
madame
i
understand
you
he
said
laughing
i
ought
therefore
to
be
doubly
thankful
that
monsieur
le
marquis
met
me
he
affords
me
an
opportunity
to
offer
you
excuses
which
might
be
full
of
danger
were
you
not
kindness
itself
the
marquise
looked
at
the
young
man
with
an
air
of
some
surprise
but
she
answered
with
dignity
monsieur
silence
on
your
part
will
be
the
best
excuse
as
for
me
i
promise
you
entire
forgetfulness
and
the
pardon
which
you
scarcely
deserve
madame
said
rastignac
hastily
pardon
is
not
needed
where
there
was
no
offence
the
letter
he
added
in
a
low
voice
which
you
received
and
which
you
must
have
thought
extremely
unbecoming
was
not
intended
for
you
the
marquise
could
not
help
smiling
though
she
wished
to
seem
offended
why
deceive
she
said
with
a
disdainful
air
although
the
tones
of
her
voice
were
gentle
now
that
i
have
duly
scolded
you
i
am
willing
to
laugh
at
a
subterfuge
which
is
not
without
cleverness
i
know
many
women
who
would
be
taken
in
by
it
how
he
loves
me
they
would
say
here
the
marquise
gave
a
forced
laugh
and
then
added
in
a
tone
of
indulgence
if
we
desire
to
continue
friends
let
there
be
no
more
of
which
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
be
the
dupe
upon
my
honor
madame
you
are
so
far
more
than
you
think
replied
eugene
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
monsieur
de
listomere
who
for
the
last
minute
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
penetrate
oh
nothing
that
would
interest
you
replied
his
wife
monsieur
de
listomere
tranquilly
returned
to
the
reading
of
his
paper
and
presently
said
ah
madame
de
mortsauf
is
dead
your
poor
brother
has
no
doubt
gone
to
clochegourde
are
you
aware
monsieur
resumed
the
marquise
turning
to
eugene
that
what
you
have
just
said
is
a
great
impertinence
if
i
did
not
know
the
strictness
of
your
principles
he
answered
naively
i
should
think
that
you
wished
either
to
give
me
ideas
which
i
deny
myself
or
else
to
tear
a
secret
from
me
but
perhaps
you
are
only
amusing
yourself
with
me
the
marquise
smiled
that
smile
annoyed
eugene
madame
he
said
can
you
still
believe
in
an
offence
i
have
not
committed
i
earnestly
hope
that
chance
may
not
enable
you
to
discover
the
name
of
the
person
who
ought
to
have
read
that
letter
what
can
it
be
madame
de
nucingen
cried
madame
de
listomere
more
eager
to
penetrate
that
secret
than
to
revenge
herself
for
the
impertinence
of
the
young
man
speeches
eugene
colored
a
man
must
be
more
than
years
of
age
not
to
blush
at
being
taxed
with
a
fidelity
that
women
laugh
at
in
order
perhaps
not
to
show
that
they
envy
it
however
he
replied
with
tolerable
why
not
madame
such
are
the
blunders
we
all
make
at
this
speech
caused
a
violent
commotion
in
madame
de
listomere
bosom
but
rastignac
did
not
yet
know
how
to
analyze
a
woman
face
by
a
rapid
or
sidelong
glance
the
lips
of
the
marquise
paled
but
that
was
all
she
rang
the
bell
for
wood
and
so
constrained
rastignac
to
rise
and
take
his
leave
if
that
be
so
said
the
marquise
stopping
eugene
with
a
cold
and
rigid
manner
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
explain
monsieur
why
your
pen
should
by
accident
write
my
name
a
name
written
on
a
letter
is
not
a
friend
which
you
might
have
taken
carelessly
on
leaving
a
ball
eugene
discomfited
looked
at
the
marquise
with
an
air
that
was
both
stupid
and
conceited
he
felt
that
he
was
becoming
ridiculous
and
after
stammering
a
few
juvenile
phrases
he
left
the
room
a
few
days
later
the
marquise
acquired
undeniable
proofs
that
eugene
had
told
the
truth
for
the
last
fortnight
she
has
not
been
seen
in
society
the
marquis
tells
all
those
who
ask
him
the
reason
of
this
seclusion
my
wife
has
an
inflammation
of
the
stomach
but
i
her
physician
who
am
now
attending
her
know
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
slight
nervous
attack
which
she
is
making
the
most
of
in
order
to
stay
quietly
