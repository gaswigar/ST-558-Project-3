not

preserved
that
reputation
with
more
ease
not
only
during

but
in
death
none
so
completely
hides
his
personality
in
his
glory
in
an
epoch
of
the
utmost

which
the
most
insignificant
deeds
of
a

of

of
notre

found
a
way
of
effacing
his
personality
in
his
work
of
de
maupassant
we
know
that
he
was
born
in
normandy
about
that
he
was
the
favorite
pupil
if
one
may
so
express
it
the
literary
of
gustave
flaubert
that
he
made
his
late
in
with
a
novel
inserted
in
a
small
collection
published
by
emile
zola
and
his
young
friends
under
the
title
the
soirées
of
medan
that
subsequently
he
did
not
fail
to
publish
stories
and
romances
every
year
up
to
when
a
disease
of
the
brain
struck
him
down
in
the
fullness
of
production
and
that
he
died
finally
in
without
having
recovered
his
reason
we
know
too
that
he
passionately
loved
a
strenuous
physical
life
and
long
journeys
particularly
long
journeys
upon
the
sea
he
owned
a
little
sailing
yacht
named
after
one
of
his
books
in
which
he
used
to
sojourn
for
weeks
and
months
these
meager
details
are
almost
the
only
ones
that
have
been
gathered
as
food
for
the
curiosity
of
the
public
i
leave
the
legendary
side
which
is
always
in
evidence
in
the
case
of
a
celebrated
man
that
gossip
for
example
which
avers
that
maupassant
was
a
high
liver
and
a
worldling
the
very
number
of
his
volumes
is
a
protest
to
the
contrary
one
could
not
write
so
large
a
number
of
pages
in
so
small
a
number
of
years
without
the
virtue
of
industry
a
virtue
incompatible
with
habits
of
dissipation
this
does
not
mean
that
the
writer
of
these
great
romances
had
no
love
for
pleasure
and
had
not
tasted
the
world
but
that
for
him
these
were
secondary
things
the
psychology
of
his
work
ought
then
to
find
an
interpretation
other
than
that
afforded
by
wholly
false
or
exaggerated
anecdotes
i
wish
to
indicate
here
how
this
work
illumined
by
the
three
or
four
positive
data
which
i
have
given
appears
to
me
to
demand
it
and
first
what
does
that
anxiety
to
conceal
his
personality
prove
carried
as
it
was
to
such
an
extreme
degree
the
answer
rises
spontaneously
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
studied
closely
the
history
of
literature
the
absolute
silence
about
himself
preserved
by
one
whose
position
among
us
was
that
of
a
tourgenief
or
of
a
mérimée
and
of
a
molière
or
a
shakespeare
among
the
classic
great
reveals
to
a
person
of
instinct
a
nervous
sensibility
of
extreme
depth
there
are
many
chances
for
an
artist
of
his
kind
however
timid
or
for
one
who
has
some
grief
to
show
the
depth
of
his
emotion
to
take
up
again
only
two
of
the
names
just
cited
this
was
the
case
with
the
author
of
terres
vierges
and
with
the
writer
of
colomba
a
somewhat
minute
analysis
of
the
novels
and
romances
of
maupassant
would
suffice
to
demonstrate
even
if
we
did
not
know
the
nature
of
the
incidents
which
prompted
them
that
he
also
suffered
from
an
excess
of
nervous
emotionalism
nine
times
out
of
ten
what
is
the
subject
of
these
stories
to
which
freedom
of
style
gives
the
appearance
of
health
a
tragic
episode

random

notre

his
imagination
aims
to
represent
the
human
being
as
imprisoned
in
a
situation
at
once
insupportable
and
inevitable
the
spell
of
this
grief
and
trouble
exerts
such
a
power
upon
the
writer
that
he
ends
stories
commenced
in
pleasantry
with
some
sinister
drama
let
me
instance
a
midnight
revel
the
little
cask
and
old
amable
you
close
the
book
at
the
end
of
these
vigorous
sketches
and
feel
how
surely
they
point
to
constant
suffering
on
the
part
of
him
who
executed
them
this
is
the
leading
trait
in
the
literary
physiognomy
of
maupassant
as
it
is
the
leading
and
most
profound
trait
in
the
psychology
of
his
work
that
human
life
is
a
snare
laid
by
nature
where
joy
is
always
changed
to
misery
where
noble
words
and
the
highest
professions
of
faith
serve
the
lowest
plans
and
the
most
cruel
egoism
where
chagrin
crime
and
folly
are
forever
on
hand
to
pursue
implacably
our
hopes
nullify
our
virtues
and
annihilate
our
wisdom
but
this
is
not
the
whole
maupassant
has
been
called
a
literary
nihilist
but
and
this
is
the
second
trait
of
his
singular
genius
in
him
nihilism
finds
itself
coexistent
with
an
animal
energy
so
fresh
and
so
intense
that
for
a
long
time
it
deceives
the
closest
observer
in
an
eloquent
discourse
pronounced
over
his
premature
grave
emile
zola
well
defined
this
illusion
we
congratulated
him
said
he
upon
that
health
which
seemed
unbreakable
and
justly
credited
him
with
the
soundest
constitution
of
our
band
as
well
as
with
the
clearest
mind
and
the
sanest
reason
it
was
then
that
this
frightful
thunderbolt
destroyed
him
it
is
not
exact
to
say
that
the
lofty
genius
of
de
maupassant
was
that
of
an
absolutely
sane
man
we
comprehend
it
and
on
him
we
find
traces
everywhere
of
his
final
malady
but
it
is
exact
to
say
that
this
wounded
genius
was
by
a
singular
circumstance
the
genius
of
a
robust
man
a
physiologist
would
without
doubt
explain
this
anomaly
by
the
coexistence
of
a
nervous
lesion
light
at
first
with
a
muscular
athletic
temperament
whatever
the
cause
the
effect
is
undeniable
the
skilled
and
dainty
pessimism
of
de
maupassant
was
accompanied
by
a
vigor
and
physique
very
unusual
his
sensations
are
in
turn
those
of
a
hunter
and
of
a
sailor
who
have
as
the
old
french
saying
expressively
puts
it
swift
foot
eagle
eye
and
who
are
attuned
to
all
the
whisperings
of
nature
the
only
confidences
that
he
has
ever
permitted
his
pen
to
tell
of
the
intoxication
of
a
free
animal
existence
are
in
the
opening
pages
of
the
story
entitled
mouche
where
he
recalls
among
the
sweetest
memories
of
his
youth
his
rollicking
canoe
parties
upon
the
seine
and
in
the
description
in
la
vie
errante
of
a
night
spent
on
the
sea
to
be
alone
upon
the
water
under
the
sky
through
a
warm
night
in
which
he
speaks
of
the
happiness
of
those
who
receive
sensations
through
the
whole
surface
of
their
flesh
as
they
do
through
their
eyes
their
mouth
their
ears
and
sense
of
smell
his
unique
and
too
scanty
collection
of
verses
written
in
early
youth
contains
the
two
most
fearless
i
was
going
to
say
the
most
ingenuous
paeans
perhaps
that
have
been
written
since
the
renaissance
at
the
water
edge
au
bord
de
and
the
rustic
venus
la
venus
rustique
but
here
is
a
paganism
whose
ardor
by
a
contrast
which
brings
up
the
ever
present
duality
of
his
nature
ends
in
an
inexpressible
shiver
of
scorn
we
look
at
each
other
astonished
immovable
and
both
are
so
pale
that
it
makes
us
fear
alas
through
all
our
senses
slips
life
itself
away
this
ending
of
the
water
edge
is
less
sinister
than
the
murder
and
the
vision
of
horror
which
terminate
the
pantheistic
hymn
of
the
rustic
venus
considered
as
documents
revealing
the
cast
of
mind
of
him
who
composed
them
these
two
lyrical
essays
are
especially
significant
since
they
were
spontaneous
they
explain
why
de
maupassant
in
the
early
years
of
production
voluntarily
chose
as
the
heroes
of
his
stories
creatures
very
near
to
primitive
existence
peasants
sailors
poachers
girls
of
the
farm
and
the
source
of
the
vigor
with
which
he
describes
these
rude
figures
the
robustness
of
his
animalism
permits
him
fully
to
imagine
all
the
simple
sensations
of
these
beings
while
his
pessimism
which
tinges
these
sketches
of
brutal
customs
with
an
element
of
delicate
scorn
preserves
him
from
coarseness
it
is
this
constant
and
involuntary
antithesis
which
gives
unique
value
to
those
norman
scenes
which
have
contributed
so
much
to
his
glory
it
corresponds
to
those
two
contradictory
tendencies
in
literary
art
which
seek
always
to
render
life
in
motion
with
the
most
intense
coloring
and
still
to
make
more
and
more
subtle
the
impression
of
this
life
how
is
one
ambition
to
be
satisfied
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
since
all
gain
in
color
and
movement
brings
about
a
diminution
of
sensibility
and
conversely
the
paradox
of
his
constitution
permitted
to
maupassant
this
seemingly
impossible
accord
aided
as
he
was
by
an
intellect
whose
influence
was
all
powerful
upon
his
development
the
writer
i
mention
above
gustave
flaubert
these
meetings
of
a
pupil
and
a
master
both
great
are
indeed
rare
they
present
in
fact
some
troublesome
conditions
the
first
of
which
is
a
profound
analogy
between
two
types
of
thought
there
must
have
been
besides
a
reciprocity
of
affection
which
does
not
often
obtain
between
a
renowned
senior
who
is
growing
old
and
an
obscure
junior
whose
renown
is
increasing
from
generation
to
generation
envy
reascends
no
less
than
she
redescends
for
the
honor
of
french
men
of
letters
let
us
add
that
this
exceptional
phenomenon
has
manifested
itself
twice
in
the
nineteenth
century
mérimée
whom
i
have
also
named
received
from
stendhal
at
twenty
the
same
benefits
that
maupassant
received
from
flaubert
the
author
of
une
vie
and
the
writer
of
clara
jozul
resemble
each
other
besides
in
a
singular
and
analogous
circumstance
both
achieved
renown
at
the
first
blow
and
by
a
masterpiece
which
they
were
able
to
equal
but
never
surpass
both
were
misanthropes
early
in
life
and
practised
to
the
end
the
ancient
advice
that
the
disciple
of
beyle
carried
upon
his
seal
μεμνήσο
απιστἔιν
remember
to
distrust
and
at
the
same
time
both
had
delicate
tender
hearts
under
this
affectation
of
cynicism
both
were
excellent
sons
irreproachable
friends
indulgent
masters
and
both
were
idolized
by
their
inferiors
both
were
worldly
yet
still
loved
a
wanderer
life
both
joined
to
a
constant
taste
for
luxury
an
irresistible
desire
for
solitude
both
belonged
to
the
extreme
left
of
the
literature
of
their
epoch
but
kept
themselves
from
excess
and
used
with
a
judgment
marvelously
sure
the
sounder
principles
of
their
school
they
knew
how
to
remain
lucid
and
classic
in
taste
as
much
as
in
form
mérimée
through
all
the
audacity
of
a
fancy
most
exotic
and
maupassant
in
the
realism
of
the
most
varied
and
exact
observation
at
a
little
distance
they
appear
to
be
two
patterns
identical
in
certain
traits
of
the
same
family
of
minds
and
tourgenief
who
knew
and
loved
the
one
and
the
other
never
failed
to
class
them
as
brethren
they
are
separated
however
by
profound
differences
which
perhaps
belong
less
to
their
nature
than
to
that
of
the
masters
from
whom
they
received
their
impulses
stendhal
so
alert
so
mobile
after
a
youth
passed
in
war
and
a
ripe
age
spent
in
vagabond
journeys
rich
in
experiences
immediate
and
personal
flaubert
so
poor
in
direct
impressions
so
paralyzed
by
his
health
by
his
family
by
his
theories
even
and
so
rich
in
reflections
for
the
most
part
solitary
among
the
theories
of
the
anatomist
of
madame
bovary
there
are
two
which
appear
without
ceasing
in
his
correspondence
under
one
form
or
another
and
these
are
the
ones
which
are
most
strongly
evident
in
the
art
of
de
maupassant
we
now
see
the
consequences
which
were
inevitable
by
reason
of
them
endowed
as
maupassant
was
with
a
double
power
of
feeling
life
bitterly
and
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
of
animal
force
the
first
theory
bears
upon
the
choice
of
personages
and
the
story
of
the
romance
the
second
upon
the
character
of
the
style
the
son
of
a
physician
and
brought
up
in
the
rigors
of
scientific
method
flaubert
believed
this
method
to
be
efficacious
in
art
as
in
science
for
instance
in
the
writing
of
a
romance
he
seemed
to
be
as
scientific
as
in
the
development
of
a
history
of
customs
in
which
the
essential
is
absolute
exactness
and
local
color
he
therefore
naturally
wished
to
make
the
most
scrupulous
and
detailed
observation
of
the
environment
thus
is
explained
the
immense
labor
in
preparation
which
his
stories
cost
him
the
story
of
madame
bovary
of
the
sentimental
education
and
bouvard
and
pécuchet
documents
containing
as
much
as
his
historical
stories
beyond
everything
he
tried
to
select
details
that
were
eminently
significant
consequently
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
romance
writer
should
discard
all
that
lessened
this
significance
that
is
extraordinary
events
and
singular
heroes
the
exceptional
personage
it
seemed
to
him
should
be
suppressed
as
should
also
high
dramatic
incident
since
produced
by
causes
less
general
these
have
a
range
more
restricted
the
truly
scientific
romance
writer
proposing
to
paint
a
certain
class
will
attain
his
end
more
effectively
if
he
incarnate
personages
of
the
middle
order
and
consequently
paint
traits
common
to
that
class
and
not
only
traits
but
adventures
from
this
point
of
view
examine
the
three
great
romances
of
the
master
from
rouen
and
you
will
see
that
he
has
not
lost
sight
of
this
first
and
greatest
principle
of
his
art
any
more
than
he
has
of
the
second
which
was
that
these
documents
should
be
drawn
up
in
prose
of
absolutely
perfect
technique
we
know
with
what
passionate
care
he
worked
at
his
phrases
and
how
indefatigably
he
changed
them
over
and
over
again
thus
he
satisfied
that
instinct
of
beauty
which
was
born
of
his
romantic
soul
while
he
gratified
the
demand
of
truth
which
inhered
from
his
scientific
training
by
his
minute
and
scrupulous
exactness
the
theory
of
the
mean
of
truth
on
one
side
as
the
foundation
of
the
subject
the
humble
truth
as
he
termed
it
at
the
beginning
of
une
vie
and
of
the
agonizing
of
beauty
on
the
other
side
in
composition
determines
the
whole
use
that
maupassant
made
of
his
literary
gifts
it
helped
to
make
more
intense
and
more
systematic
that
dainty
yet
dangerous
pessimism
which
in
him
was
innate
the
personage
in
wearisome
society
like
ours
is
always
a
caricature
and
the
happenings
are
nearly
always
vulgar
when
one
studies
a
great
number
of
them
one
finishes
by
looking
at
humanity
from
the
angle
of
disgust
and
despair
the
philosophy
of
the
romances
and
novels
of
de
maupassant
is
so
continuously
and
profoundly
surprising
that
one
becomes
overwhelmed
by
it
it
reaches
limitation
it
seems
to
deny
that
man
is
susceptible
to
grandeur
or
that
motives
of
a
superior
order
can
uplift
and
ennoble
the
soul
but
it
does
so
with
a
sorrow
that
is
profound
all
that
portion
of
the
sentimental
and
moral
world
which
in
itself
is
the
highest
remains
closed
to
it
in
revenge
this
philosophy
finds
itself
in
a
relation
cruelly
exact
with
the
of
our
day
by
that
i
mean
the
poorly
educated
individual
who
has
rubbed
against
knowledge
enough
to
justify
a
certain
egoism
but
who
is
too
poor
in
faculty
to
conceive
an
ideal
and
whose
native
grossness
is
corrupted
beyond
redemption
under
his
blouse
or
under
his
coat
whether
he
calls
himself
renardet
as
does
the
foul
assassin
in
petite
roque
or
duroy
as
does
the
sly
hero
of
or
bretigny
as
does
the
vile
seducer
of
mont
oriol
or
césaire
the
son
of
old
amable
in
the
novel
of
that
name
this
degraded
type
abounds
in
maupassant
stories
evoked
with
a
ferocity
almost
jovial
where
it
meets
the
robustness
of
temperament
which
i
have
pointed
out
a
ferocity
which
gives
them
a
reality
more
exact
still
because
the
person
is
often
impulsive
and
in
consequence
the
physical
easily
predominates
there
as
elsewhere
the
degenerate
is
everywhere
a
degenerate
who
gives
the
impression
of
being
an
ordinary
man
there
are
quantities
of
men
of
this
stamp
in
large
cities
no
writer
has
felt
and
expressed
this
complex
temperament
with
more
justice
than
de
maupassant
and
as
he
was
an
infinitely
careful
observer
of
and
landscape
and
all
that
constitutes
a
precise
middle
distance
his
novels
can
be
considered
an
irrefutable
record
of
the
social
classes
which
he
studied
at
a
certain
time
and
along
certain
lines
the
norman
peasant
and
the
provençal
peasant
for
example
also
the
small
officeholder
the
gentleman
of
the
provinces
the
country
squire
the
clubman
of
paris
the
journalist
of
the
boulevard
the
doctor
at
the
spa
the
commercial
artist
and
on
the
feminine
side
the
servant
girl
the
working
girl
the
the
street
girl
rich
or
poor
the
gallant
lady
of
the
city
and
of
the
provinces
and
the
society
woman
these
are
some
of
the
figures
that
he
has
painted
at
many
sittings
and
whom
he
used
to
such
effect
that
the
novels
and
romances
in
which
they
are
painted
have
come
to
be
history
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
comprehend
the
rome
of
the
cæsars
without
the
work
of
petronius
so
is
it
impossible
to
fully
comprehend
the
france
of
without
these
stories
of
maupassant
they
are
no
more
the
whole
image
of
the
country
than
the
satyricon
was
the
whole
image
of
rome
but
what
their
author
has
wished
to
paint
he
has
painted
to
the
life
and
with
a
brush
that
is
graphic
in
the
extreme
if
maupassant
had
only
painted
in
general
fashion
the
characters
and
the
phase
of
literature
mentioned
he
would
not
be
distinguished
from
other
writers
of
the
group
called
naturalists
his
true
glory
is
in
the
extraordinary
superiority
of
his
art
he
did
not
invent
it
and
his
method
is
not
alien
to
that
of
madame
bovary
but
he
knew
how
to
give
it
a
suppleness
a
variety
and
a
freedom
which
were
always
wanting
in
flaubert
the
latter
in
his
best
pages
is
always
strained
to
use
the
expressive
metaphor
of
the
greek
athletes
he
smells
of
the
oil
when
one
recalls
that
when
attacked
by
hysteric
epilepsy
flaubert
postponed
the
crisis
of
the
terrible
malady
by
means
of
sedatives
this
strained
atmosphere
of
labor
i
was
going
to
say
of
stupor
which
pervades
his
work
is
explained
he
is
an
athlete
a
runner
but
one
who
drags
at
his
feet
a
terrible
weight
he
is
in
the
race
only
for
the
prize
of
effort
an
effort
of
which
every
motion
reveals
the
intensity
maupassant
on
the
other
hand
if
he
suffered
from
a
nervous
lesion
gave
no
sign
of
it
except
in
his
heart
his
intelligence
was
bright
and
lively
and
above
all
his
imagination
served
by
senses
always
on
the
alert
preserved
for
some
years
an
astonishing
freshness
of
direct
vision
if
his
art
was
due
to
flaubert
it
is
no
more
belittling
to
him
than
if
one
call
raphael
an
imitator
of
perugini
like
flaubert
he
excelled
in
composing
a
story
in
distributing
the
facts
with
subtle
gradation
in
bringing
in
at
the
end
of
a
familiar
dialogue
something
startlingly
dramatic
but
such
composition
with
him
seems
easy
and
while
the
descriptions
are
marvelously
well
established
in
his
stories
the
reverse
is
true
of
flaubert
which
always
appear
a
little
veneered
maupassant
phrasing
however
dramatic
it
may
be
remains
easy
and
flowing
maupassant
always
sought
for
large
and
harmonious
rhythm
in
his
deliberate
choice
of
terms
always
chose
sound
wholesome
language
with
a
constant
care
for
technical
beauty
inheriting
from
his
master
an
instrument
already
forged
he
wielded
it
with
a
surer
skill
in
the
quality
of
his
style
at
once
so
firm
and
clear
so
gorgeous
yet
so
sober
so
supple
and
so
firm
he
equals
the
writers
of
the
seventeenth
century
his
method
so
deeply
and
simply
french
succeeds
in
giving
an
indescribable
tang
to
his
descriptions
if
observation
from
nature
imprints
upon
his
tales
the
strong
accent
of
reality
the
prose
in
which
they
are
shrined
so
conforms
to
the
genius
of
the
race

to
smack
of
the
soil
it

de

probably
the
most
versatile
and
brilliant
among
the
galaxy
of
novelists
who
enriched
french
literature
between
the
years
and
poetry
drama
prose
of
short
and
sustained
effort
and
volumes
of
travel
and
description
each
sparkling
with
the
same
minuteness
of
detail
and
brilliancy
of
style
flowed
from
his
pen
during
the
twelve
years
of
his
literary
life
although
his
genius
asserted
itself
in
youth
he
had
the
patience
of
the
true
artist
spending
his
early
manhood
in
cutting
and
polishing
the
facets
of
his
genius
under
the
stern
though
paternal
mentorship
of
gustave
flaubert
not
until
he
had
attained
the
age
of
thirty
did
he
venture
on
publication
challenging
criticism
for
the
first
time
with
a
volume
of
poems
many
and
various
have
been
the
judgments
passed
upon
maupassant
work
but
now
that
the
perspective
of
time
is
lengthening
enabling
us
to
form
a
more
deliberate
and
therefore
a
juster
view
of
his
complete
achievement
we
are
driven
irresistibly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
force
that
shaped
and
swayed
maupassant
prose
writings
was
the
conviction
that
in
life
there
could
be
no
phase
so
noble
or
so
mean
so
honorable
or
so
contemptible
so
lofty
or
so
low
as
to
be
unworthy
of
chronicling
no
groove
of
human
virtue
or
fault
success
or
failure
wisdom
or
folly
that
did
not
possess
its
own
peculiar
psychological
aspect
and
therefore
demanded
analysis
to
this
analysis
maupassant
brought
a
facile
and
dramatic
pen
a
penetration
as
searching
as
a
probe
and
a
power
of
psychological
vision
that
in
its
minute
detail
now
pathetic
now
ironical
in
its
merciless
revelation
of
the
hidden
springs
of
the
human
heart
whether
of
aristocrat
peasant
or
priest
allow
one
to
call
him
a
meissonier
in
words
the
school
of
romantic
realism
which
was
founded
by
mérimée
and
balzac
found
its
culmination
in
de
maupassant
he
surpassed
his
mentor
flaubert
in
the
breadth
and
vividness
of
his
work
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
french
critics
has
recorded
the
deliberate
opinion
that
of
all
taine
pupils
maupassant
had
the
greatest
command
of
language
and
the
most
finished
and
incisive
style
robust
in
imagination
and
fired
with
natural
passion
his
psychological
curiosity
kept
him
true
to
human
nature
while
at
the
same
time
his
mental
eye
when
fixed
upon
the
most
ordinary
phases
of
human
conduct
could
see
some
new
motive
or
aspect
of
things
hitherto
unnoticed
by
the
careless
crowd
it
has
been
said
by
casual
critics
that
maupassant
lacked
one
quality
indispensable
to
the
production
of
truly
artistic
work
viz
an
absolutely
normal
that
is
moral
point
of
view
the
answer
to
this
criticism
is
obvious
no
dissector
of
the
gamut
of
human
passion
and
folly
in
all
its
tones
could
present
aught
that
could
be
called
new
if
ungifted
with
a
totally
out
of
the
ordinary
plane
cold
and
merciless
in
the
use
of
this
de
de
maupassant
undoubtedly
is
especially
in
such
vivid
depictions
of
love
both
physical
and
maternal
as
we
find
in
fille
de
ferme
and
la
femme
de

but
then
the
surgeon

hesitates
at
giving
pain
and

road
to

and
ease

une
vie
may
bear
the
palm
this
romance
has
the
distinction
of
having
changed
tolstoi
from
an
adverse
critic
into
a
warm
admirer
of
the
author
to
quote
the
russian
moralist
upon
the
book
vie
is
a
romance
of
the
best
type
and
in
my
judgment
the
greatest
that
has
been
produced
by
any
french
writer
since
victor
hugo
penned
misérables
passing
over
the
force
and
directness
of
the
narrative
i
am
struck
by
the
intensity
the
grace
and
the
insight
with
which
the
writer
treats
the
new
aspects
of
human
nature
which
he
finds
in
the
life
he
describes
and
as
if
gracefully
to
recall
a
former
adverse
criticism
tolstoi
adds
i
find
in
the
book
in
almost
equal
strength
the
three
cardinal
qualities
essential
to
great
work
viz
moral
purpose
perfect
style
and
absolute
sincerity
maupassant
is
a
man
whose
vision
has
penetrated
the
silent
depths
of
human
life
and
from
that
interprets
the
struggle
of
humanity
appeared
almost
two
years
after
une
vie
that
is
to
say
about
discussed
and
criticised
as
it
has
been
it
is
in
reality
a
satire
an
indignant
outburst
against
the
corruption
of
society
which
in
the
story
enables
an
devoid
of
conscience
honor
even
of
the
commonest
regard
for
others
to
gain
wealth
and
rank
the
purport
of
the
story
is
clear
to
those
who
recognize
the
ideas
that
governed
maupassant
work
and
even
the
hasty
reader
or
critic
on
reading
mont
oriol
which
was
published
two
years
later
and
is
based
on
a
combination
of
the
which
inspired
une
vie
and
will
reconsider
former
hasty
judgments
and
feel
too
that
beneath
the
triumph
of
evil
which
calls
forth
maupassant
satiric
anger
there
lies
the
substratum
on
which
all
his
work
is
founded
viz
the
persistent
ceaseless
questioning
of
a
soul
unable
to
reconcile
or
explain
the
contradiction
between
love
in
life
and
inevitable
death
who
can
read
in
the
terribly
graphic
description
of
the
consumptive
journalist
demise
his
frantic
clinging
to
life
and
his
refusal
to
credit
the
slow
and
merciless
approach
of
death
without
feeling
that
the
question
asked
at
naishapur
many
centuries
ago
is
still
waiting
for
the
solution
that
is
always
promised
but
never
comes
in
the
romances
which
followed
dating
from
to
a
sort
of
calm
despair
seems
to
have
settled
down
upon
de
maupassant
attitude
toward
life
psychologically
acute
as
ever
and
as
perfect
in
style
and
sincerity
as
before
we
miss
the
note
of
anger
fatality
is
the
keynote
and
yet
sounding
low
we
detect
a
genuine
subtone
of
sorrow
was
it
a
prescience
of
so
much
work
to
be
done
so
much
work
demanded
of
him
the
world
of
paris
in
all
its
brilliant
and
attractive
phases
at
his
feet
and
yet
inevitable
ever
advancing
death
with
the
question
of
life
still
unanswered
this
may
account
for
some
of
the
strained
situations
we
find
in
his
later
romances
vigorous
in
frame
and
hearty
as
he
was
the
atmosphere
of
his
mental
processes
must
have
been
vitiated
to
produce
the
dainty
but
dangerous
pessimism
that
pervades
some
of
his
later
work
this
was
partly
a
consequence
of
his
honesty
and
partly
of
mental
despair
he
never
accepted
other
people
views
on
the
questions
of
life
he
looked
into
such
problems
for
himself
arriving
at
the
truth
as
it
appeared
to
him
by
the
logic
of
events
often
finding
evil
where
he
wished
to
find
good
but
never
hoodwinking
himself
or
his
readers
by
adapting
or
distorting
the
reality
of
things
to
suit
a
preconceived
idea
maupassant
was
essentially
a
worshiper
of
the
eternal
feminine
he
was
persuaded
that
without
the
continual
presence
of
the
gentler
sex
existence
would
be
an
emotionally
silent
wilderness
no
other
french
writer
has
described
and
analyzed
so
minutely
and
comprehensively
the
many
and
various
motives
and
moods
that
shape
the
conduct
of
a
woman
in
life
take
for
instance
the
wonderfully
subtle
analysis
of
a
woman
heart
as
wife
and
mother
that
we
find
in
une
vie
could
aught
be
more
delicately
incisive
sometimes
in
describing
the
apparently
inexplicable
conduct
of
a
certain
woman
he
leads
his
readers
to
a
point
where
a
false
step
would
destroy
the
spell
and
bring
the
reproach
of
banality
and
ridicule
upon
the
tale
but
the
catastrophe
never
occurs
it
was
necessary
to
stand
poised
upon
the
brink
of
the
precipice
to
realize
the
depth
of
the
abyss
and
feel
the
terror
of
the
fall
closely
allied
to
this
phase
of
maupassant
nature
was
the
peculiar
feeling
of
loneliness
that
every
now
and
then
breaks
irresistibly
forth
in
the
course
of
some
short
story
of
kindly
soul
and
genial
heart
he
suffered
not
only
from
the
oppression
of
spirit
caused
by
the
lack
of
humanity
kindliness
sanity
and
harmony
which
he
encountered
daily
in
the
world
at
large
but
he
had
an
ever
abiding
sense
of
the
invincible
unbanishable
solitariness
of
his
own
inmost
self
i
know
of
no
more
poignant
expression
of
such
a
feeling
than
the
cry
of
despair
which
rings
out
in
the
short
story
called
solitude
in
which
he
describes
the
insurmountable
barrier
which
exists
between
man
and
man
or
man
and
woman
however
intimate
the
friendship
between
them
he
could
picture
but
one
way
of
destroying
this
terrible
loneliness
the
attainment
of
a
spiritual
a
divine
state
of
love
a
condition
to
which
he
would
give
no
name
utterable
by
human
lips
lest
it
be
profaned
but
for
which
his
whole
being
yearned
how
acutely
he
felt
his
failure
to
attain
his
deliverance
may
be
drawn
from
his
wail
that
mankind
has
no
universal
measure
of
happiness
each
one
of
us
writes
de
maupassant
forms
for
himself
an
illusion
through
which
he
views
the
world
be
it
poetic
sentimental
joyous
melancholy
or
dismal
an
illusion
of
beauty
which
is
a
human
convention
of
ugliness
which
is
a
matter
of
opinion
of
truth
which
alas
is
never
immutable
and
he
concludes
by
asserting
that
the
happiest
artist
is
he
who
approaches
most
closely
to
the
truth
of
things
as
he
sees
them
through
his
own
particular
illusion
salient
points
in
de
maupassant
genius
were
that
he
possessed
the
rare
faculty
of
holding
direct
communion
with
his
gifts
and
of
writing
from
their
dictation
as
it
was
interpreted
by
his
senses
he
had
no
patience
with
writers
who
in
striving
to
present
life
as
a
whole
purposely
omit
episodes
that
reveal
the
influence
of
the
senses
as
well
he
says
refrain
from
describing
the
effect
of
intoxicating
perfumes
upon
man
as
omit
the
influence
of
beauty
on
the
temperament
of
man
de
maupassant
dramatic
instinct
was
supremely
powerful
he
seems
to
select
unerringly
the
one
thing
in
which
the
soul
of
the
scene
is
prisoned
and
making
that
his
keynote
gives
a
picture
in
words
which
haunt
the
memory
like
a
strain
of
music
the
description
of
the
ride
of
madame
tellier
and
her
companions
in
a
country
cart
through
a
norman
landscape
is
an
admirable
example
you
smell
the
masses
of
the
colza
in
blossom
you
see
the
yellow
carpets
of
ripe
corn
spotted
here
and
there
by
the
blue
coronets
of
the
cornflower
and
rapt
by
the
red
blaze
of
the
poppy
beds
and
bathed
in
the
fresh
greenery
of

you
share
in
the
emotions
felt
by

party
in

yet
with
all
his
vividness
of
description
de
maupassant
is
always
sober
and
brief
he
had
the
genius
of
condensation
and
the
reserve
which
is
innate
in
power
and
to
his
reader
could
convey
as
much
in
a
paragraph
as
could
be
expressed
in
a
page
by
many
of
his
predecessors
and
contemporaries
flaubert
not
excepted
apart
from
his
novels
de
maupassant
tales
may
be
arranged
under
three
heads
those
that
concern
themselves
with
norman
peasant
life
those
that
deal
with
government
employees
maupassant
himself
had
long
been
one
and
the
paris
middle
classes
and
those
that
represent
the
life
of
the
fashionable
world
as
well
as
the
weird
and
fantastic
ideas
of
the
later
years
of
his
career
of
these
three
groups
the
tales
of
the
norman
peasantry
perhaps
rank
highest
he
depicts
the
norman
farmer
in
surprisingly
free
and
bold
strokes
revealing
him
in
all
his
caution
astuteness
rough
gaiety
and
homely
virtue
the
tragic
stage
of
de
maupassant
life
may
i
think
be
set
down
as
beginning
just
before
the
drama
of
musotte
was
issued
in
conjunction
with
jacques
normand
in
he
had
almost
given
up
the
hope
of
interpreting
his
puzzles
and
the
struggle
between
the
falsity
of
the
life
which
surrounded
him
and
the
nobler
visions
which
possessed
him
was
wearing
him
out
doubtless
he
resorted
to
unwise
methods
for
the
dispelling
of
physical
lassitude
or
for
surcease
from
troubling
mental
problems
to
this
period
belong
such
weird
and
horrible
fancies
as
are
contained
in
the
short
stories
known
as
he
and
the
diary
of
a
madman
here
and
there
we
know
were
rising
in
him
inklings
of
a
finer
and
less
sordid
attitude
man
and
woman
throughout
the
world
and
of
a
purer
constitution
of
existing
things
which
no
exterior
force
should
blemish
or
destroy
but
with
these
yearningly
prophetic
gleams
came
a
period
of
mental
death
then
the
physical
veil
was
torn
aside
and
for
guy
de
maupassant
the
riddle
of
existence
was
answered

the
introduction
one
day
massival
the
celebrated
composer
of
rebecca
who
for
fifteen
years
now
had
been
known
as
the
young
and
illustrious
master
said
to
his
friend
andré
mariolle
why
is
it
that
you
have
never
secured
a
presentation
to
mme
michèle
de
burne
take
my
word
for
it
she
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
women
in
new
paris
because
i
do
not
feel
myself
at
all
adapted
to
her
surroundings
you
are
wrong
my
dear
fellow
it
is
a
house
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
novelty
and
originality
it
is
and
very
artistic
there
is
excellent
music
and
the
conversation
is
as
good
as
in
the
best
salons
of
the
last
century
you
would
be
highly
appreciated
in
the
first
place
because
you
play
so
well
on
the
violin
then
because
you
have
been
very
favorably
spoken
of
in
the
house
and
finally
because
you
have
the
reputation
of
being
select
in
your
choice
of
friends
flattered
but
still
maintaining
his
attitude
of
resistance
supposing
moreover
that
this
urgent
invitation
was
not
given
without
the
young
woman
being
aware
of
it
mariolle
ejaculated
a
bah
i
shall
not
bother
my
head
at
all
about
it
in
which
through
the
disdain
that
he
intended
to
express
was
evident
his
foregone
acceptance
massival
continued
would
you
like
to
have
me
present
you
some
of
these
days
you
are
already
known
to
her
through
all
of
us
who
are
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
her
for
we
talk
about
you
often
enough
she
is
a
very
pretty
woman
of
abounding
in
intelligence
who
will
never
take
a
second
husband
for
her
first
venture
was
a
very
unfortunate
one
she
has
made
her
abode
a
rendezvous
for
agreeable
men
there
are
not
too
many
or
found
there
just
enough
of
them
to
give
the
proper
effect
she
will
be
delighted
to
have
me
introduce
you
mariolle
was
vanquished
he
replied
very
well
then
one
of
these
days
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
week
the
musician
came
to
his
house
and
asked
him
are
you
disengaged
why
yes
very
well
i
will
take
you
to
dine
with
mme
de
burne
she
requested
me
to
invite
you
besides
here
is
a
line
from
her
after
a
few
seconds
reflection
for
form
sake
mariolle
answered
that
is
settled
andré
mariolle
was
about
years
old
a
bachelor
without
a
profession
wealthy
enough
to
live
in
accordance
with
his
likings
to
travel
and
even
to
indulge
himself
in
collecting
modern
paintings
and
ancient
knickknacks
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
intelligence
rather
odd
and
unsociable
a
little
capricious
and
disdainful
who
affected
the
hermit
through
pride
rather
than
through
timidity
very
talented
and
acute
but
indolent
quick
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
things
and
capable
perhaps
of
accomplishing
something
great
he
had
contented
himself
with
enjoying
life
as
a
spectator
or
rather
as
a
had
he
been
poor
he
would
doubtless
have
turned
out
to
be
a
remarkable
or
celebrated
man
born
with
a
good
income
he
was
eternally
reproaching
himself
that
he
could
never
be
anything
better
than
a
nobody
it
is
true
that
he
had
made
more
than
one
attempt
in
the
direction
of
the
arts
but
they
had
lacked
vigor
one
had
been
in
the
direction
of
literature
by
publishing
a
pleasing
book
of
travels
abounding
in
incident
and
correct
in
style
one
toward
music
by
his
in
which
he
had
gained
even
among
professional
musicians
a
respectable
reputation
and
finally
one
at
sculpture
that
art
in
which
native
aptitude
and
the
faculty
of
striking
and
deceptive
figures
atone
in
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
for
deficiencies
in
study
and
knowledge
his
statuette
in
masseur
tunisien
had
even
been
moderately
successful
at
the
salon
of
the
preceding
year
he
was
a
remarkable
horseman
and
was
also
it
was
said
an
excellent
fencer
although
he
never
used
the
foils
in
public
owing
perhaps
to
the
same
feeling
which
impelled
him
to
absent
himself
from
society
resorts
where
serious
rivalries
were
to
be
apprehended
his
friends
appreciated
him
however
and
were
unanimous
in
extolling
his
merits
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
they
had
little
to
fear
from
him
in
the
way
of
competition
it
was
said
of
him
that
in
every
case
he
was
reliable
a
devoted
friend
extremely
agreeable
in
manner
and
very
sympathetic
in
his
personality
tall
of
stature
wearing
his
black
beard
short
upon
the
cheeks
and
trained
down
to
a
fine
point
upon
the
chin
with
hair
that
was
beginning
to
turn
gray
but
curled
very
prettily
he
looked
one
straight
in
the
face
with
a
pair
of
clear
brown
piercing
eyes
in
which
lurked
a
shade
of
distrust
and
hardness
among
his
intimates
he
had
an
especial
predilection
for
artists
of
every
kind
among
them
gaston
de
lamarthe
the
novelist
massival
the
musician
and
the
painters
jobin
rivollet
de
mandol
who
seemed
to
set
a
high
value
on
his
reason
his
friendship
his
intelligence
and
even
his
judgment
although
at
bottom
with
the
vanity
that
is
inseparable
from
success
achieved
they
set
him
down
as
a
very
agreeable
and
very
intelligent
man
who
had
failed
to
score
a
success
mariolle
haughty
reserve
seemed
to
say
i
am
nothing
because
i
have
not
chosen
to
be
anything
he
lived
within
a
narrow
circle
therefore
disdaining
gallantry
and
the
great
frequented
salons
where
others
might
have
shone
more
brilliantly
than
he
and
might
have
obliged
him
to
take
his
place
among
the
of
society
he
visited
only
those
houses
where
appreciation
was
extended
to
the
solid
qualities
that
he
was
unwilling
to
display
and
though
he
had
consented
so
readily
to
allow
himself
to
be
introduced
to
mme
michèle
de
burne
the
reason
was
that
his
best
friends
those
who
everywhere
proclaimed
his
hidden
merits
were
the
intimates
of
this
young
woman
she
lived
in
a
pretty
in
the
rue
du
behind
the
church
of
saint
augustin
there
were
two
rooms
with
an
outlook
on
the
street
the
and
a
salon
the
one
in
which
she
received
her
company
indiscriminately
and
two
others
that
opened
on
a
handsome
garden
of
which
the
owner
of
the
property
had
the
enjoyment
of
the
latter
the
first
was
a
second
salon
of
large
dimensions
of
greater
length
than
width
with
three
windows
opening
on
the
trees
the
leaves
of
which
brushed
against
the
awnings
a
room
which
was
embellished
with
furniture
and
ornaments
exceptionally
rare
and
simple
in
the
purest
and
soberest
taste
and
of
great
value
the
tables
the
chairs
the
little
cupboards
or
the
pictures
the
fans
and
the
porcelain
figures
beneath
glass
covers
the
vases
the
statuettes
the
great
clock
fixed
in
the
middle
of
a
panel
the
entire
decoration
of
this
young
woman
apartment
attracted
and
held
attention
by
its
shape
its
age
or
its
elegance
to
create
for
herself
this
home
of
which
she
was
almost
as
proud
as
she
was
of
her
own
person
she
had
laid
under
contribution
the
knowledge
the
friendship
the
good
nature
and
the
rummaging
instinct
of
every
artist
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
rich
and
willing
to
pay
well
and
her
friends
had
discovered
for
her
many
things
distinguished
by
originality
which
the
mere
vulgar
amateur
would
have
passed
by
with
contempt
thus
with
their
assistance
she
had
furnished
this
dwelling
to
which
access
was
obtained
with
difficulty
and
where
she
imagined
that
her
friends
received
more
pleasure
and
returned
more
gladly
than
elsewhere
it
was
even
a
favorite
hobby
of
hers
to
assert
that
the
colors
of
the
curtains
and
hangings
the
comfort
of
the
seats
the
beauty
of
form
and
the
gracefulness
of
general
effect
are
of
as
much
avail
to
charm
captivate
and
acclimatize
the
eye
as
are
pretty
smiles
sympathetic
or
antipathetic
rooms
she
would
say
whether
rich
or
poor
attract
hold
or
repel
just
like
the
people
who
live
in
them
they
awake
the
feelings
or
stifle
them
warm
or
chill
the
mind
compel
one
to
talk
or
be
silent
make
one
sad
or
cheerful
in
a
word
they
give
every
visitor
an
unaccountable
desire
to
remain
or
to
go
away
about
the
middle
of
this
dimly
lighted
gallery
a
grand
piano
standing
between
two
filled
with
flowers
occupied
the
place
of
honor
and
dominated
the
room
beyond
this
a
lofty
door
with
two
leaves
opened
gave
access
to
the
bedroom
which
in
turn
communicated
with
a
also
very
large
and
elegant
hung
with
chintz
like
a
in
summer
where
mme
de
burne
generally
kept
herself
when
she
had
no
company
married
to
a
one
of
those
domestic
tyrants
before
whom
everything
must
bend
and
yield
she
had
at
first
been
very
unhappy
for
five
years
she
had
had
to
endure
the
unreasonable
exactions
the
harshness
the
jealousy
even
the
violence
of
this
intolerable
master
and
terrified
beside
herself
with
astonishment
she
had
submitted
without
revolt
to
this
revelation
of
married
life
crushed
as
she
was
beneath
the
despotic
and
torturing
will
of
the
brutal
man
whose
victim
she
had
become
he
died
one
night
from
an
aneurism
as
he
was
coming
home
and
when
she
saw
the
body
of
her
husband
brought
in
covered
with
a
sheet
unable
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
this
deliverance
she
looked
at
his
corpse
with
a
deep
feeling
of
repressed
joy
and
a
frightful
dread
lest
she
might
show
it
cheerful
independent
even
exuberant
by
nature
very
flexible
and
attractive
with
bright
flashes
of
wit
such
as
are
shown
in
some
incomprehensible
way
in
the
intellects
of
certain
little
girls
of
paris
who
seem
to
have
breathed
from
their
earliest
childhood
the
stimulating
air
of
the
boulevards
where
every
evening
through
the
open
doors
of
the
theaters
the
applause
or
the
hisses
that
greet
the
plays
come
forth
borne
on
the
air
she
nevertheless
retained
from
her
five
years
of
servitude
a
strange
timidity
grafted
upon
her
audacity
a
great
fear
lest
she
might
say
too
much
do
too
much
together
with
a
burning
desire
for
emancipation
and
a
stern
resolve
never
again
to
do
anything
to
imperil
her
liberty
her
husband
a
man
of
the
world
had
trained
her
to
receive
like
a
mute
slave
elegant
polite
and
well
dressed
the
despot
had
numbered
among
his
friends
many
artists
whom
she
had
received
with
curiosity
and
listened
to
with
delight
without
ever
daring
to
allow
them
to
see
how
she
understood
and
appreciated
them
when
her
period
of
mourning
was
ended
she
invited
a
few
of
them
to
dinner
one
evening
two
of
them
sent
excuses
three
accepted
and
were
astonished
to
find
a
young
woman
of
admirable
intelligence
and
charming
manners
who
immediately
put
them
at
their
ease
and
gracefully
told
them
of
the
pleasure
that
they
had
afforded
her
in
former
days
by
coming
to
her
house
from
among
her
old
acquaintances
who
had
ignored
her
or
failed
to
recognize
her
qualities
she
thus
gradually
made
a
selection
according
to
her
inclinations
and
as
a
widow
an
enfranchised
woman
but
one
determined
to
maintain
her
good
name
she
began
to
receive
all
the
most
distinguished
men
of
paris
whom
she
could
bring
together
with
only
a
few
women
the
first
to
be
admitted
became
her
intimates
formed
a
nucleus
attracted
others
and
gave
to
the
house
the
air
of
a
small
court
to
which
every
contributed
either
personal
merit
or
a
great
name
for
a
few
titles
were
mingled
with
the
intelligence
of
the
commonalty
her
father
de
pradon
who
occupied
the
apartment
over
hers
served
as
her
chaperon
and
an
old
beau
very
elegant
and
witty
and
extremely
attentive
to
his
daughter
whom
he
treated
rather
as
a
lady
acquaintance
than
as
a
daughter
he
presided
at
the
thursday
dinners
that
were
quickly
known
and
talked
of
in
paris
and
to
which
invitations
were
much
sought
after

requests

introductions
and

very
frequently
rejected
by
a
sort
of
vote
of
the
inner
council

their
origin
in

themselves
at

gave
the

a

steps
before
appearing
at
the
eden
or

over

kept
jealous
watch
and
ward
and
to
whom
the
recollection
of
her
commerce
with
the
world
under
the
auspices
of
marital
authority
was
loathsome
was
sufficiently
wise
not
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
her
acquaintance
to
too
great
an
extent
satisfied
and
at
the
same
time
terrified
as
to
what
might
be
said
and
thought
of
her
she
abandoned
herself
to
her
somewhat
bohemian
inclinations
with
consummate
prudence
she
valued
her
good
name
and
was
fearful
of
any
rashness
that
might
jeopardize
it
she
never
allowed
her
fancies
to
carry
her
beyond
the
bounds
of
propriety

her
audacity
and
careful
that

imputed

made
love
to
her

none
of

been
successful
they
confessed

admitted

to
each

surprise

never
acknowledge
and
perhaps
they
are
right
the
power
of
resistance
of
a
woman
who
is
her
own
mistress
there
was
a
story
current
about
her
it
was
said
that
at
the
beginning
of
their
married
life
her
husband
had
exhibited
such
revolting
brutality
toward
her
that
she
had
been
forever
cured
of
the
love
of
men

a

for
his
paradoxes
for
his
eloquent
and
involved
erudition
that
was
always
up
to
date
though
incomprehensible
even
to
the
most
impassioned
of
his
female
admirers
and
for
his
clothes
which
were
selected
with
as
much
care
as
his

to
this
tried

had
added

reputation
for

the
two
privileged

who
it
appears
had
the
gift
of
being
always
able
to
divert
the
young
woman
by
their
artistic
unceremoniousness
their
chaff
and
the
way
they
had
of
making
fun

of

natural
or
assumed
however
that
she
took
never
to
manifest
a
marked
and
prolonged
predilection
for
any
one
of
her
admirers
the
unconstrained
air
with
which
she
practiced
her
coquetry
and
the
real
impartiality
with
which
she
dispensed
her
favors
maintained
between

a
friendship
seasoned
with
hostility
and
an
alertness
of
wit

made

one
of
them
would
sometimes
play
a
trick
on
the
others
by
presenting
a
friend
but
as
this
friend
was
never
a
very
celebrated
or
very
interesting
man
the

would
form
a

against

and

send

was
turning
the

and
explaining
the
pictures
as
they
entered
the
room
one
of
the
heads
was
turned
toward
them
and
mariolle
as
he
stepped
forward
became
conscious
of
a
bright
blond
face
rather
tending
to
ruddiness
upon
the
temples
of
which
the
soft
fluffy
locks
of
hair
seemed
to
blaze
with
the
flame
of
burning
brushwood
the
delicate
nose
imparted
a
smiling
expression
to
this
countenance
and
the
mouth
the
deep
dimples
in
the
cheeks
and
the
rather
prominent
cleft

gave
it
a
mocking
air
while
the

by
a
strange
contrast
veiled

in

deliberate
in

scarcely
showing
the

the
shoulders
of

that
shone
out
marvelously
under

light

a
merit
that
was

to

indispensable
to
her
that
of
loving

blindly

had
received
the
nickname
of
the

was

never
said
anything
about

jealous

seclusion

especially
evinced
their
indignation
at

evident
sympathy
of

for
this
windy
person

when
they
could
no
longer
refrain
from
reproaching

with

reprehensible

of
the

was
expatiating
on
his
theme
with
many
subtile
and
theories
and
the
novelist
accepted
them
enthusiastically

facility
with
which
men
of

receive
and
do
not
dispute

and

of
the

and

in
a
coat
that
fitted
very
closely
about
the
hips
above
his
pale
intelligent
face
emerged
from
his
white
collar
and
was
surmounted
by
smooth
blond
hair
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
glued
on
as
to
lamarthe
gaston
de
lamarthe
to
whom
the
particle
that
divided
his
name
had
imparted
some
of
the
pretensions
of
a
gentleman
and
man
of
the
world
he
was
first
last
and
all
the
time
a
man
of
letters
a
terrible
and
pitiless
man
of
letters
provided
with
an
eye
that
gathered
in
images
attitudes
and
gestures
with
the
rapidity
and
accuracy
of
the
photographer
camera
and
endowed
with
penetration
and
the
novelist
instinct
which
were
as
innate
in
him
as
the
faculty
of
scent
is
in
a
hound
he
was
busy
from
morning
till
night
storing
away
impressions
to
be
used
afterward
in
his
profession
with
these
two
very
simple
senses
a
distinct
idea
of
form
and
an
intuitive
one
of
substance
he
gave
to
his
books
in
which
there
appeared
none
of
the
ordinary
aims
of
psychological
writers
the
color
the
tone
the
appearance
the
movement
of
life
itself
each
one
of
his
novels
as
it
appeared
excited
in
society
curiosity
conjecture
merriment
or
wrath
for
there
always
seemed
to
be
prominent
persons
to
be
recognized
in
them
only
faintly
disguised
under
a
torn
mask
and
whenever
he
made
his
way
through
a
crowded
salon
he
left
a
wake
of
uneasiness
behind
him
moreover
he
had
published
a
volume
of
personal
recollections
in
which
he
had
given
the
portraits
of
many
men
and
women
of
his
acquaintance
without
any
clearly
defined
intention
of
unkindness
but
with
such
precision
and
severity
that
they
felt
sore
over
it
some
one
had
applied
to
him
the
beware
of
your
friends
he
kept
his
secrets
within
his
breast
and
was
a
puzzle
to
his
intimates
he
was
reputed
to
have
once
passionately
loved
a
woman
who
caused
him
much
suffering
and
it
was
said
that
after
that
he
wreaked
his
vengeance
upon
others
of
her
sex
massival
and
he
understood
each
other
very
well
although
the
musician
was
of
a
very
different
disposition
more
frank
more
expansive
less
harassed
perhaps
but
manifestly
more
impressible
after
two
great
successes
a
piece
performed
at
brussels
and
afterward
brought
to
paris
where
it
was
loudly
applauded
at
the
then
a
second
work
that
was
received
and
interpreted
at
the
grand
opéra
as
soon
as
offered
he
had
yielded
to
that
species
of
cessation
of
impulse
that
seems
to
smite
the
greater
part
of
our
contemporary
artists
like
premature
paralysis
they
do
not
grow
old
as
their
fathers
did
in
the
midst
of
their
renown
and
success
but
seem
threatened
with
impotence
even
when
in
the
very
prime
of
life
lamarthe
was
accustomed
to
say
at
the
present
day
there
are
in
france
only
great
men
who
have
gone
wrong
just
at
this
time
massival
seemed
very
much
smitten
with
mme
de
burne
so
that
every
eye
was
turned
upon
him
when
he
kissed
her
hand
with
an
air
of
adoration
he
inquired
are
we
late
she
replied
no
i
am
still
expecting
the
baron
de
gravil
and
the
marquise
de
bratiane
ah
the
marquise
what
good
luck
we
shall
have
some
music
this
evening
then
i
hope
so
the
two
laggards
made
their
appearance
the
marquise
a
woman
perhaps
a
little
too
diminutive
italian
by
birth
of
a
lively
disposition
with
very
black
eyes
and
eyelashes
black
eyebrows
and
black
hair
to
match
which
grew
so
thick
and
so
low
down
that
she
had
no
forehead
to
speak
of
her
eyes
even
being
threatened
with
invasion
had
the
reputation
of
possessing
the
most
remarkable
voice
of
all
the
women
in
society
the
baron
a
very
gentlemanly
man
and
with
a
large
head
was
never
really
himself
unless
he
had
his
violoncello
in
his
hands
he
was
a
passionate
melomaniac
and
only
frequented
those
houses
where
music
received
its
due
share
of
honor
dinner
was
announced
and
mme
de
burne
taking
andré
mariolle
arm
allowed
her
guests
to
precede
her
to
the
then
as
they
were
left
together
the
last
ones
in
the
just
as
she
was
about
to
follow
the
procession
she
cast
upon
him
an
oblique
swift
glance
from
her
pale
eyes
with
their
dusky
pupils
in
which
he
thought
that
he
could
perceive
more
complexity
of
thought
and
more
curiosity
of
interest
than
pretty
women
generally
bestow
upon
a
strange
gentleman
when
receiving
him
at
dinner
for
the
first
time
the
dinner
was
monotonous
and
rather
dull
lamarthe
was
nervous
and
seemed
ill
disposed
toward
everyone
not
openly
hostile
for
he
made
a
point
of
his
but
displaying
that
almost
imperceptible
bad
humor
that
takes
the
life
out
of
conversation
massival
abstracted
and
preoccupied
ate
little
and
from
time
to
time
cast
furtive
glances
at
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
seemed
to
be
in
any
place
rather
than
at
her
own
table
inattentive
responding
to
remarks
with
a
smile
and
then
allowing
her
face
to
settle
back
to
its
former
intent
expression
she
appeared
to
be
reflecting
upon
something
that
seemed
greatly
to
preoccupy
her
and
to
interest
her
that
evening
more
than
did
her
friends
still
she
contributed
her
share
to
the
conversation
very
amply
as
regarded
the
marquise
and
mariolle
but
she
did
it
from
habit
from
a
sense
of
duty
visibly
absent
from
herself
and
from
her
abode
fresnel
and
de
maltry
disputed
over
contemporary
poetry
fresnel
held
the
opinions
upon
poetry
that
are
current
among
men
of
the
world
and
de
maltry
the
perceptions
of
the
spinners
of
most
complicated
verse
verse
that
is
incomprehensible
to
the
general
public
several
times
during
the
dinner
mariolle
had
again
encountered
the
young
woman
inquiring
look
but
more
vague
less
intent
less
curious
the
marquise
de
bratiane
the
comte
de
marantin
and
the
baron
de
gravil
were
the
only
ones
who
kept
up
an
uninterrupted
conversation
and
they
had
quantities
of
things
to
say
after
dinner
during
the
course
of
the
evening
massival
who
had
kept
growing
more
and
more
melancholy
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
notes
whereupon
mme
de
burne
appeared
to
awake
and
quickly
organized
a
little
concert
the
numbers
of
which
comprised
the
pieces
that
she
was
most
fond
of
the
marquise
was
in
voice
and
animated
by
massival
presence
she
sang
like
a
real
artist
the
master
accompanied
her
with
that
dreamy
look
that
he
always
assumed
when
he
sat
down
to
play
his
long
hair
fell
over
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
mingled
with
his
full
fine
shining
curling
beard
many
women
had
been
in
love
with
him
and
they
still
pursued
him
with
their
attentions
so
it
was
said
mme
de
burne
sitting
by
the
piano
and
listening
with
all
her
soul
seemed
to
be
contemplating
him
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
see
him
and
mariolle
was
a
little
jealous
he
was
not
particularly
jealous
because
of
any
relation
that
there
was
between
her
and
him
but
in
presence
of
that
look
of
a
woman
fixed
so
intently
upon
one
of
the
illustrious
he
felt
himself
humiliated
in
his
masculine
vanity
by
the
consciousness
of
the
rank
that
bestow
on
us
in
proportion
to
the
renown
that
we
have
gained
often
before
this
he
had
secretly
suffered
from
contact
with
famous
men
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
meet
in
the
presence
of
those
beings
whose
favor
is
by
far
the
dearest
reward
of
success
about
ten
the
comtesse
de
frémines
and
two
jewesses
of
the
financial
community
arrived
one
after
the
other
the
talk
was
of
a
marriage
that
was
on
the
carpet
and
a
threatened
divorce
suit
mariolle
looked
at
madame
de
burne
who
was
now
seated
beneath
a
column
that
sustained
a
huge
lamp
her
nose
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks
and
the
little
indentation
that
parted
her
chin
gave
her
face
the
frolicsome
expression
of
a
child
although
she
was
approaching
her
thirtieth
year
and
something
in
her
glance
that
reminded
one
of
a
withering
flower
cast
a
shade
of
melancholy
over
her
countenance
beneath
the
light
that
streamed
upon
it
her
skin
took
on
tones
of
blond
velvet
while
her
hair
actually
seemed
colored
by
the
autumnal
sun
which
dyes
and
scorches
the
dead
leaves
she
was
conscious
of
the
masculine
glance
that
was
traveling
toward
her
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
presently
she
arose
and
went
to
him
smiling
as
if
in
response
to
a
summons
from
him
i
am
afraid
you
are
somewhat
bored
she
said
a
person
who
has
not
got
the
run
of
a
house
is
always
bored
he
protested
the
contrary
she
took
a
chair
and
seated
herself
by
him
and
at
once
the
conversation
began
to
be
animated
it
was
instantaneous
with
both
of
them
like
a
fire
that
blazes
up
brightly
as
soon
as
a
match
is
applied
to
it
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
imparted
their
sensations
and
their
opinions
to
each
other
beforehand
as
if
a
similarity
of
disposition
and
education
of
tastes
and
inclinations
had
predisposed
them
to
a
mutual
understanding
and
fated
them
to
meet
perhaps
there
may
have
been
a
little
artfulness
on
the
part
of
the
young
woman
but
the
delight
that
one
feels
in
encountering
one
who
is
capable
of
listening
who
can
understand
you
and
reply
to
you
and
whose
answers
give
scope
for
your
repartees
put
mariolle
into
a
fine
glow
of
spirits
flattered
moreover
by
the
reception
which
she
had
accorded
him
subjugated
by
the
alluring
favor
that
she
displayed
and
by
the
charm
which
she
knew
how
to
use
so
adroitly
in
captivating
men
he
did
his
best
to
exhibit
to
her
that
shade
of
subdued
but
personal
and
delicate
wit
which
when
people
came
to
know
him
well
had
gained
for
him
so
many
and
such
warm
friendships
she
suddenly
said
to
him
really
it
is
very
pleasant
to
converse
with
you
monsieur
i
had
been
told
that
such
was
the
case
however
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
blushing
and
replied
at
a
venture
and
had
been
told
madame
that
you
were
she
interrupted
him
say
a
coquette
i
am
a
good
deal
of
a
coquette
with
people
whom
i
like
everyone
knows
it
and
i
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
from
myself
but
you
will
see
that
i
am
very
impartial
in
my
coquetry
and
this
allows
me
to
keep
or
to
recall
my
friends
without
ever
losing
them
and
to
retain
them
all
about
me
she
said
this
with
a
sly
air
which
was
meant
to
say
be
easy
and
be
too
presumptuous
do
deceive
yourself
for
you
will
get
nothing
more
than
the
others
he
replied
that
is
what
you
might
call
warning
your
guests
of
the
perils
that
await
them
here
thank
you
madame
i
greatly
admire
your
mode
of
procedure
she
had
opened
the
way
for
him
to
speak
of
herself
and
he
availed
himself
of
it
he
began
by
paying
her
compliments
and
found
that
she
was
fond
of
them
then
he
aroused
her
woman
curiosity
by
telling
her
what
was
said
of
her
in
the
different
houses
that
he
frequented
she
was
rather
uneasy
and
could
not
conceal
her
desire
for
further
information
although
she
affected
much
indifference
as
to
what
might
be
thought
of
herself
and
her
tastes
he
drew
for
her
a
charming
portrait
of
a
superior
independent
intelligent
and
attractive
woman
who
had
surrounded
herself
with
a
court
of
eminent
men
and
still
retained
her
position
as
an
accomplished
member
of
society
she
disclaimed
his
compliments
with
smiles
with
little
disclaimers
of
gratified
egotism
all
the
while
taking
much
pleasure
in
the
details
that
he
gave
her
and
in
a
playful
tone
kept
constantly
asking
him
for
more
questioning
him
artfully
with
a
sensual
appetite
for
flattery
as
he
looked
at
her
he
said
to
himself
she
is
nothing
but
a
child
at
heart
just
like
all
the
rest
of
them
and
he
went
on
to
finish
a
pretty
speech
in
which
he
was
commending
her
love
for
art
so
rarely
found
among
women
then
she
assumed
an
air
of
mockery
that
he
had
not
before
suspected
in
her
that
playfully
tantalizing
manner
that
seems
inherent
in
the
french
mariolle
had
overdone
his
eulogy
she
let
him
know
that
she
was
not
a
fool
dieu
she
said
i
will
confess
to
you
that
i
am
not
quite
certain
whether
it
is
art
or
artists
that
i
love
he
replied
how
could
one
love
artists
without
being
in
love
with
art
because
they
are
sometimes
more
comical
than
men
of
the
world
yes
but
they
have
more
unpleasant
failings
that
is
true
then
you
do
not
love
music
she
suddenly
dropped
her
bantering
tone
excuse
me
i
adore
music
i
think
that
i
am
more
fond
of
it
than
of
anything
else
and
yet
massival
is
convinced
that
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
did
he
tell
you
so
no
but
he
thinks
so
how
do
you
know
oh
we
women
guess
at
almost
everything
that
we
do
know
so
massival
thinks
that
you
know
nothing
of
music
i
am
sure
of
it
i
can
see
it
only
by
the
way
that
he
has
of
explaining
things
to
me
by
the
way
in
which
he
underscores
little
niceties
of
expression
all
the
while
saying
to
himself
wo
be
of
any
use
but
i
do
it
because
you
are
so
nice
still
he
has
told
me
that
you
have
the
best
music
in
your
house
of
any
in
paris
no
matter
whose
the
other
may
be
yes
thanks
to
him
and
literature
are
you
not
fond
of
that
i
am
very
fond
of
it
and
i
am
even
so
audacious
as
to
claim
to
have
a
very
good
perception
of
it
notwithstanding
lamarthe
opinion
who
also
decides
that
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
of
course
but
who
has
not
told
you
so
in
words
any
more
than
the
other
pardon
me
he
is
more
outspoken
he
asserts
that
certain
women
are
capable
of
showing
a
very
just
and
delicate
perception
of
the
sentiments
that
are
expressed
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
characters
of
psychology
in
general
but
that
they
are
totally
incapable
of
discerning
the
superiority
that
resides
in
his
profession
its
art
when
he
has
once
uttered
this
word
art
all
that
is
left
one
to
do
is
to
show
him
the
door
mariolle
smiled
and
asked
and
you
madame
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
reflected
for
a
few
seconds
then
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
to
see
if
he
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
listen
and
to
understand
her
i
believe
that
sentiment
you
understand
sentiment
can
make
a
woman
mind
receptive
of
everything
only
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
what
enters
does
not
remain
there
do
you
follow
me
no
not
fully
madame
very
well
to
make
us
comprehensive
to
the
same
degree
as
you
our
woman
nature
must
be
appealed
to
before
addressing
our
intelligence
we
take
no
interest
in
what
a
man
has
not
first
made
sympathetic
to
us
for
we
look
at
all
things
through
the
medium
of
sentiment
i
do
not
say
through
the
medium
of
love
no
but
of
sentiment
which
has
shades
forms
and
manifestations
of
every
sort
sentiment
is
something
that
belongs
exclusively
to
our
domain
which
you
men
have
no
conception
of
for
it
befogs
you
while
it
enlightens
us
oh
i
know
that
all
this
is
incomprehensible
to
you
the
more
the
pity
in
a
word
if
a
man
loves
us
and
is
agreeable
to
us
for
it
is
indispensable
that
we
should
feel
that
we
are
loved
in
order
to
become
capable
of
the
effort
and
if
this
man
is
a
superior
being
by
taking
a
little
pains
he
can
make
us
feel
know
and
possess
everything
everything
i
say
and
at
odd
moments
and
by
bits
impart
to
us
the
whole
of
his
intelligence
that
is
all
often
blotted
out
afterward
it
disappears
dies
out
for
we
are
forgetful
oh
we
forget
as
the
wind
forgets
the
words
that
are
spoken
to
it
we
are
intuitive
and
capable
of
enlightenment
but
changeable
impressionable
readily
swayed
by
our
surroundings
if
i
could
only
tell
you
how
many
states
of
mind
i
pass
through
that
make
of
me
entirely
different
women
according
to
the
weather
my
health
what
i
may
have
been
reading
what
may
have
been
said
to
me
actually
there
are
days
when
i
have
the
feelings
of
an
excellent
mother
without
children
and
others
when
i
almost
have
those
of
a
without
lovers
greatly
pleased
he
asked
is
it
your
opinion
that
intelligent
women
generally
are
gifted
with
this
activity
of
thought
yes
she
said
only
they
allow
it
to
slumber
and
then
they
have
a
life
shaped
for
them
which
draws
them
in
one
direction
or
the
other
again
he
questioned
then
in
your
heart
of
hearts
it
is
music
that
you
prefer
above
all
other
distractions
yes
but
what
i
was
telling
you
just
now
is
so
true
i
should
certainly
never
have
enjoyed
it
as
i
do
enjoy
it
adored
it
as
i
do
adore
it
had
it
not
been
for
that
angelic
massival
he
seems
to
have
given
me
the
soul
of
the
great
masters
by
teaching
me
to
play
their
works
of
which
i
was
passionately
fond
before
what
a
pity
that
he
is
married
she
said
these
last
words
with
a
sprightly
air
but
so
regretfully
that
they
threw
everything
else
into
shadow
her
theories
upon
women
and
her
admiration
for
art
massival
was
in
fact
married
before
the
days
of
his
success
he
had
contracted
one
of
those
unions
that
artists
make
and
afterward
trail
after
them
through
their
renown
until
the
day
of
their
death
he
never
mentioned
his
wife
name
never
presented
her
in
society
which
he
frequented
a
great
deal
and
although
he
had
three
children
the
fact
was
scarcely
known
mariolle
laughed
she
was
decidedly
nice
was
this
unconventional
woman
pretty
and
of
a
type
not
often
met
with
without
ever
tiring
with
a
persistency
that
seemed
in
no
wise
embarrassing
to
her
he
kept
gazing
upon
that
face
grave
and
gay
and
a
little
with
its
audacious
nose
and
its
sensual
coloring
of
a
soft
warm
blonde
warmed
by
the
midsummer
of
a
maturity
so
tender
so
full
so
sweet
that
she
seemed
to
have
reached
the
very
year
the
month
the
minute
of
her
perfect
flowering
he
wondered
is
her
complexion
false
and
he
looked
for
the
faint
telltale
line
lighter
or
darker
at
the
roots
of
her
hair
without
being
able
to
discover
it
soft
footsteps
on
the
carpet
behind
him
made
him
start
and
turn
his
head
it
was
two
servants
bringing
in
the
over
the
blue
flame
of
the
little
lamp
the
water
bubbled
gently
in
a
great
silver
receptacle
as
shining
and
complicated
as
a
chemist
apparatus
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
she
asked
upon
his
acceptance
she
arose
and
with
a
firm
step
in
which
there
was
no
undulation
but
which
was
rather
marked
by
stiffness
proceeded
to
the
table
where
the
water
was
simmering
in
the
depths
of
the
machine
surrounded
by
a
little
garden
of
cakes
pastry
candied
fruits
and
bonbons
then
as
her
profile
was
presented
in
clear
relief
against
the
hangings
of
the
salon
mariolle
observed
the
delicacy
of
her
form
and
the
thinness
of
her
hips
beneath
the
broad
shoulders
and
the
full
chest
that
he
had
been
admiring
a
moment
before
as
the
train
of
her
light
dress
unrolled
and
dragged
behind
her
seemingly
prolonging
upon
the
carpet
a
body
that
had
no
end
this
blunt
thought
arose
to
his
mind
behold
a
siren
she
is
altogether
promising
she
was
now
going
from
one
to
another
offering
her
refreshments
with
gestures
of
exquisite
grace
mariolle
was
following
her
with
his
eyes
but
lamarthe
who
was
walking
about
with
his
cup
in
his
hand
came
up
to
him
and
said
shall
we
go
you
and
i
yes
i
think
so
we
will
go
at
once
shall
we
not
i
am
tired
at
once
come
they
left
the
house
when
they
were
in
the
street
the
novelist
asked
are
you
going
home
or
to
the
club
i
think
that
i
will
go
and
spend
an
hour
at
the
club
at
the
tambourins
yes
i
will
go
as
far
as
the
door
with
you
those
places
are
tiresome
to
me
i
never
put
my
foot
in
them
i
join
them
only
because
they
enable
me
to
economize
in
they
locked
arms
and
went
down
the
street
toward
saint
augustin
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
then
mariolle
said
what
a
singular
woman
what
do
you
think
of
her
lamarthe
began
to
laugh
outright
it
is
the
commencement
of
the
crisis
he
said
you
will
have
to
pass
through
it
just
as
we
have
all
done
i
have
had
the
malady
but
i
am
cured
of
it
now
my
dear
friend
the
crisis
consists
of
her
friends
talking
of
nothing
but
of
her
when
they
are
together
whenever
they
chance
to
meet
wherever
they
may
happen
to
be
at
all
events
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
case
and
it
is
very
natural
for
me
to
ask
for
information
since
i
scarcely
know
her
let
it
be
so
then
we
will
talk
of
her
well
you
are
bound
to
fall
in
love
with
her
it
is
your
fate
the
lot
that
is
shared
by
all
she
is
so
very
seductive
then
yes
and
no
those
who
love
the
women
of
other
days
women
who
have
a
heart
and
a
soul
women
of
sensibility
the
women
of
the
novel
can
not
endure
her
and
execrate
her
to
such
a
degree
as
to
speak
of
her
with
ignominy
we
on
the
other
hand
who
are
disposed
to
look
favorably
upon
what
is
modern
and
fresh
are
compelled
to
confess
that
she
is
delicious
provided
always
that
we
do
fall
in
love
with
her
and
that
is
just
exactly
what
everybody
does
no
one
dies
of
the
complaint
however
they
do
not
even
suffer
very
acutely
but
they
fume
because
she
is
not
other
than
she
is
you
will
have
to
go
through
it
all
if
she
takes
the
fancy
besides
she
is
already
preparing
to
snap
you
up
mariolle
exclaimed
in
response
to
his
secret
thought
oh
i
am
only
a
chance
acquaintance
for
her
and
i
imagine
that
she
values
acquaintances
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
yes
she
values
them
and
at
the
same
time
she
laughs
at
them
the
most
celebrated
even
the
most
distinguished
man
will
not
darken
her
door
ten
times
if
he
is
not
congenial
to
her
and
she
has
formed
a
stupid
attachment
for
that
idiotic
fresnel
and
that
tiresome
de
maltry
she
inexcusably
suffers
herself
to
be
carried
away
by
those
idiots
no
one
knows
why
perhaps
because
she
gets
more
amusement
out
of
them
than
she
does
out
of
us
perhaps
because
their
love
for
her
is
deeper
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
pleases
a
woman
so
much
as
to
be
loved
like
that
and
lamarthe
went
on
talking
of
her
analyzing
her
pulling
her
to
pieces
correcting
himself
only
to
contradict
himself
again
replying
with
unmistakable
warmth
and
sincerity
to
mariolle
questions
like
a
man
who
is
deeply
interested
in
his
subject
and
carried
away
by
it
a
little
at
sea
also
having
his
mind
stored
with
observations
that
were
true
and
deductions
that
were
false
he
said
she
is
not
the
only
one
moreover
at
this
minute
there
are
fifty
women
if
not
more
who
are
like
her
there
is
the
little
frémines
who
was
in
her
just
now
she
is
mme
de
burne
exact
counterpart
save
that
she
is
more
forward
in
her
manners
and
married
to
an
outlandish
kind
of
fellow
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
her
house
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
lunatic
asylums
in
paris
i
go
there
a
great
deal
without
noticing
it
they
had
traversed
the
boulevard
malesherbes
the
rue
royale
the
avenue
des
and
had
reached
the
arc
de
triomphe
when
lamarthe
suddenly
pulled
out
his
watch
my
dear
fellow
he
said
we
have
spent
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
in
talking
of
her
that
is
sufficient
for
i
will
take
some
other
occasion
of
seeing
you
to
your
club
go
home
and
go
to
bed
it
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
chapter
ii
will
you
walk
into
my
parlor
the
room
was
large
and
well
lighted
the
walls
and
ceiling
hung
with
admirable
hangings
of
chintz
that
a
friend
of
hers
in
the
diplomatic
service
had
brought
home
and
presented
to
her
the
ground
was
yellow
as
if
it
had
been
dipped
in
golden
cream
and
the
designs
of
all
colors
in
which
persian
green
was
predominant
represented
fantastic
buildings
with
curving
roofs
about
which
monstrosities
in
the
shape
of
beasts
and
birds
were
running
and
flying
lions
wearing
wigs
antelopes
with
extravagant
horns
and
birds
of
paradise
the
furniture
was
scanty
upon
three
long
tables
with
tops
of
green
marble
were
arranged
all
the
implements
requisite
for
a
pretty
toilette
upon
one
of
them
the
central
one
were
the
great
basins
of
thick
crystal
the
second
presented
an
array
of
bottles
boxes
and
vases
of
all
sizes
surmounted
by
silver
caps
bearing
her
arms
and
monogram
while
on
the
third
were
displayed
all
the
tools
and
appliances
of
modern
coquetry
countless
in
number
designed
to
serve
various
complex
and
mysterious
purposes
the
room
contained
only
two
reclining
chairs
and
a
few
low
soft
and
luxurious
seats
calculated
to
afford
rest
to
weary
limbs
and
to
bodies
relieved
of
the
restraint
of
clothing
covering
one
entire
side
of
the
apartment
was
an
immense
mirror
composed
of
three
panels
the
two
wings
playing
on
hinges
allowed
the
young
woman
to
view
herself
at
the
same
time
in
front
rear
and
profile
to
envelop
herself
in
her
own
image
to
the
right
in
a
recess
that
was
generally
concealed
by
hanging
draperies
was
the
bath
or
rather
a
deep
pool
reached
by
a
descent
of
two
steps
a
bronze
love
a
charming
conception
of
the
sculptor
prédolé
poured
hot
and
cold
water
into
it
through
the
seashells
with
which
he
was
playing
at
the
back
of
this
alcove
a
venetian
mirror
composed
of
smaller
mirrors
inclined
to
each
other
at
varying
angles
ascended
in
a
curved
dome
shutting
in
and
protecting
the
bath
and
its
occupant
and
reflecting
them
in
each
one
of
its
many
component
parts
a
little
beyond
the
bath
was
her
a
plain
and
handsome
piece
of
furniture
of
modern
english
manufacture
covered
with
a
litter
of
papers
folded
letters
little
torn
envelopes
on
which
glittered
gilt
initials
for
it
was
in
this
room
that
she
passed
her
time
and
attended
to
her
correspondence
when
she
was
alone
stretched
at
full
length
upon
her
enveloped
in
a
of
chinese
silk
her
bare
arms
and
beautiful
firm
supple
arms
they
were
issuing
forth
fearlessly
from
out
the
wide
folds
of
silk
her
hair
turned
up
and
burdening
the
head
with
its
masses
of
blond
coils
mme
de
burne
was
indulging
herself
with
a
gentle
reverie
after
the
bath
the
chambermaid
knocked
then
entered
bringing
a
letter
she
took
it
looked
at
the
writing
tore
it
open
and
read
the
first
lines
then
calmly
said
to
the
servant
i
will
ring
for
you
in
an
hour
when
she
was
alone
she
smiled
with
the
delight
of
victory
the
first
words
had
sufficed
to
let
her
understand
that
at
last
she
had
received
a
declaration
of
love
from
mariolle
he
had
held
out
much
longer
than
she
had
thought
he
was
capable
of
doing
for
during
the
last
three
months
she
had
been
besieging
him
with
such
attentions
such
display
of
grace
and
efforts
to
charm
as
she
had
never
hitherto
employed
for
anyone
he
had
seemed
to
be
distrustful
and
on
his
guard
against
her
against
the
bait
of
insatiable
coquetry
that
she
was
continually
dangling
before
his
eyes
it
had
required
many
a
confidential
conversation
into
which
she
had
thrown
all
the
physical
seduction
of
her
being
and
all
the
captivating
efforts
of
her
mind
many
an
evening
of
music
as
well
when
seated
before
the
piano
that
was
ringing
still
before
the
leaves
of
the
scores
that
were
full
of
the
soul
of
the
tuneful
masters
they
had
both
thrilled
with
the
same
emotion
before
she
at
last
beheld
in
his
eyes
that
avowal
of
the
vanquished
man
the
mendicant
supplication
of
a
love
that
can
no
longer
be
concealed
she
knew
all
this
so
well
the
many
and
many
a
time
with
feline
cunning
and
inexhaustible
curiosity
she
had
made
this
secret
torturing
plea
rise
to
the
eyes
of
the
men
whom
she
had
succeeded
in
beguiling
it
afforded
her
so
much
amusement
to
feel
that
she
was
gaining
them
little
by
little
that
they
were
conquered
subjugated
by
her
invincible
woman
might
that
she
was
for
them
the
only
one
the
sovereign
idol
whose
caprices
must
be
obeyed
it
had
all
grown
up
within
her
almost
imperceptibly
like
the
development
of
a
hidden
instinct
the
instinct
of
war
and
conquest
perhaps
it
was
that
a
desire
of
retaliation
had
germinated
in
her
heart
during
her
years
of
married
life
a
dim
longing
to
repay
to
men
generally
that
measure
of
ill
which
she
had
received
from
one
of
them
to
be
in
turn
the
strongest
to
make
stubborn
wills
bend
before
her
to
crush
resistance
and
to
make
others
as
well
as
she
feel
the
keen
edge
of
suffering
above
all
else
however
she
was
a
born
coquette
and
as
soon
as
her
way
in
life
was
clear
before
her
she
applied
herself
to
pursuing
and
subjugating
lovers
just
as
the
hunter
pursues
the
game
with
no
other
end
in
view
than
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
fall
before
her
and
yet
her
heart
was
not
eager
for
emotion
like
that
of
a
tender
and
sentimental
woman
she
did
not
seek
a
man
undivided
love
nor
did
she
look
for
happiness
in
passion
all
that
she
needed
was
universal
admiration
homage
prostrations
an
of
tenderness
whoever
frequented
her
house
had
also
to
become
the
slave
of
her
beauty
and
no
consideration
of
mere
intellect
could
attach
her
for
any
length
of
time
to
those
who
would
not
yield
to
her
coquetry
disdainful
of
the
anxieties
of
love
their
affections
perhaps
being
placed
elsewhere
in
order
to
retain
her
friendship
it
was
indispensable
to
love
her
but
that
point
once
reached
she
was
infinitely
nice
with
unimaginable
kindnesses
and
delightful
attentions
designed
to
retain
at
her
side
those
whom
she
had
captivated
those
who
were
once
enlisted
in
her
regiment
of
adorers
seemed
to
become
her
property
by
right
of
conquest
she
ruled
them
with
great
skill
and
wisdom
according
to
their
qualities
and
their
defects
and
the
nature
of
their
jealousy
those
who
sought
to
obtain
too
much
she
expelled
forthwith
taking
them
back
again
afterward
when
they
had
become
wiser
but
imposing
severe
conditions
and
to
such
an
extent
did
this
game
of
bewitchment
amuse
her
perverse
woman
that
she
was
that
she
found
it
as
pleasurable
to
befool
steady
old
gentlemen
as
to
turn
the
heads
of
the
young
it
might
even
have
been
said
that
she
regulated
her
affection
by
the
fervency
of
the
ardor
that
she
had
inspired
and
that
big
fresnel
a
dull
heavy
companion
who
was
of
no
imaginable
benefit
to
her
retained
her
favor
thanks
to
the
mad
passion
by
which
she
felt
that
he
was
possessed
she
was
not
entirely
indifferent
to
men
merits
either
and
more
than
once
had
been
conscious
of
the
commencement
of
a
liking
that
no
one
divined
except
herself
and
which
she
quickly
ended
the
moment
it
became
dangerous
everyone
who
had
approached
her
for
the
first
time
and
warbled
in
her
ear
the
fresh
notes
of
his
hymn
of
gallantry
disclosing
to
her
the
unknown
quantity
of
his
nature
artists
more
especially
who
seemed
to
her
to
possess
more
subtile
and
more
delicate
shades
of
refined
emotion
had
for
a
time
disquieted
her
had
awakened
in
her
the
intermittent
dream
of
a
grand
passion
and
a
long
but
swayed
by
prudent
fears
irresolute
driven
this
way
and
that
by
her
distrustful
nature
she
had
always
kept
a
strict
watch
upon
herself
until
the
moment
she
ceased
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
latest
lover
and
then
she
had
the
sceptical
vision
of
the
girl
of
the
period
who
would
strip
the
greatest
man
of
his
prestige
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
as
soon
as
they
were
fully
in
her
toils
and
in
the
disorder
of
their
heart
had
thrown
aside
their
theatrical
posturings
and
their
parade
manners
they
were
all
alike
in
her
eyes
poor
creatures
whom
she
could
tyrannize
over
with
her
seductive
powers
finally
for
a
woman
like
her
perfect
as
she
was
to
attach
herself
to
a
man
what
inestimable
merits
he
would
have
had
to
possess
she
suffered
much
from
however
and
was
without
fondness
for
society
which
she
frequented
for
the
sake
of
appearances
and
the
long
tedious
evenings
of
which
she
endured
with
heavy
eyelids
and
many
a
stifled
yawn
she
was
amused
only
by
its
refined
trivialities
by
her
own
caprices
and
by
her
quickly
changing
curiosity
for
certain
persons
and
certain
things
attaching
herself
to
it
in
such
degree
as
to
realize
that
she
had
been
appreciated
or
admired
and
not
enough
to
receive
real
pleasure
from
an
affection
or
a
liking
suffering
from
her
nerves
and
not
from
her
desires
she
was
without
the
absorbing
preoccupations
of
ardent
or
simple
souls
and
passed
her
days
in
an
of
gaieties
destitute
of
the
simple
faith
that
attends
on
happiness
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
something
to
make
the
slow
hours
pass
more
quickly
and
sinking
with
lassitude
while
deeming
herself
contented
she
thought
that
she
was
contented
because
she
was
the
most
seductive
and
the
most
sought
after
of
women
proud
of
her
attractiveness
the
power
of
which
she
often
made
trial
in
love
with
her
own
irregular
odd
and
captivating
beauty
convinced
of
the
delicacy
of
her
perceptions
which
allowed
her
to
divine
and
understand
a
thousand
things
that
others
were
incapable
of
seeing
rejoicing
in
the
wit
that
had
been
appreciated
by
so
many
superior
men
and
totally
ignoring
the
limitations
that
bounded
her
intelligence
she
looked
upon
herself
as
an
almost
unique
being
a
rare
pearl
set
in
the
midst
of
this
common
workaday
world
which
seemed
to
her
slightly
empty
and
monotonous
because
she
was
too
good
for
it
not
for
an
instant
would
she
have
suspected
that
in
her
unconscious
self
lay
the
cause
of
the
melancholy
from
which
she
suffered
so
continuously
she
laid
the
blame
upon
others
and
held
them
responsible
for
her
if
they
were
unable
sufficiently
to
entertain
and
amuse
or
even
impassion
her
the
reason
was
that
they
were
deficient
in
agreeableness
and
possessed
no
real
merit
in
her
eyes
everyone
she
would
say
with
a
little
laugh
is
tiresome
the
only
endurable
people
are
those
who
afford
me
pleasure
and
that
solely
because
they
do
afford
me
pleasure
and
the
surest
way
of
pleasing
her
was
to
tell
her
that
there
was
no
one
like
her
she
was
well
aware
that
no
success
is
attained
without
labor
and
so
she
gave
herself
up
heart
and
soul
to
her
work
of
enticement
and
found
nothing
that
gave
her
greater
enjoyment
than
to
note
the
homage
of
the
softening
glance
and
of
the
heart
that
unruly
organ
which
she
could
cause
to
beat
violently
by
the
utterance
of
a
word
she
had
been
greatly
surprised
by
the
trouble
that
she
had
had
in
subjugating
andré
mariolle
for
she
had
been
well
aware
from
the
very
first
day
that
she
had
found
favor
in
his
eyes
then
little
by
little
she
had
fathomed
his
suspicious
secretly
envious
extremely
subtile
and
concentrated
disposition
and
attacking
him
on
his
weak
side
she
had
shown
him
so
many
attentions
had
manifested
such
preference
and
natural
sympathy
for
him
that
he
had
finally
surrendered
especially
in
the
last
month
had
she
felt
that
he
was
her
captive
he
was
agitated
in
her
presence
now
taciturn
now
feverishly
animated
but
would
make
no
avowal
oh
avowals
she
really
did
not
care
very
much
for
them
for
when
they
were
too
direct
too
expressive
she
found
herself
obliged
to
resort
to
severe
measures
twice
she
had
even
had
to
make
a
show
of
being
angry
and
close
her
door
to
the
offender
what
she
adored
were
delicate
manifestations
discreet
allusions
a
sort
of
moral
and
she
really
showed
exceptional
tact
and
address
in
extorting
from
her
admirers
this
moderation
in
their
expressions
for
a
month
past
she
had
been
watching
and
waiting
to
hear
fall
from
mariolle
lips
the
words
distinct
or
veiled
according
to
the
nature
of
the
man
which
afford
relief
to
the
overburdened
heart
he
had
said
nothing
but
he
had
written
it
was
a
long
letter
four
pages
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
crept
over
her
as
she
held
it
in
her
hands
she
stretched
herself
at
length
upon
her
lounge
so
as
to
be
more
comfortable
and
kicked
the
little
slippers
from
off
her
feet
upon
the
carpet
then
she
proceeded
to
read
she
met
with
a
surprise
in
serious
terms
he
told
her
that
he
did
not
desire
to
suffer
at
her
hands
and
that
he
already
knew
her
too
well
to
consent
to
be
her
victim
with
many
compliments
in
very
polite
words
which
everywhere
gave
evidence
of
his
repressed
love
he
let
her
know
that
he
was
apprised
of
her
manner
of
treating
men
that
he
too
was
in
the
toils
but
that
he
would
release
himself
from
the
servitude
by
taking
himself
off
he
would
just
simply
begin
his
vagabond
life
of
other
days
over
again
he
would
leave
the
country
it
was
a
farewell
an
eloquent
and
firm
farewell
certainly
it
was
a
surprise
as
she
read
and
commenced
to
read
again
these
four
pages
of
prose
that
were
so
full
of
tender
irritation
and
passion
she
arose
put
on
her
slippers
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
her
bare
arms
out
of
her
sleeves
her
hands
thrust
halfway
into
the
little
pockets
of
her
one
of
them
holding
the
crumpled
letter
taken
all
aback
by
this
unforeseen
declaration
she
said
to
herself
he
writes
very
well
very
well
indeed
he
is
sincere
feeling
touching
he
writes
better
than
lamarthe
there
is
nothing
of
the
novel
sticking
out
of
his
letter
she
felt
like
smoking
went
to
the
table
where
the
perfumes
were
and
took
a
cigarette
from
a
box
of
dresden
china
then
having
lighted
it
she
approached
the
great
mirror
in
which
she
saw
three
young
women
coming
toward
her
in
the
three
diversely
inclined
panels
when
she
was
quite
near
she
halted
made
herself
a
little
bow
with
a
little
smile
a
friendly
little
nod
of
the
head
as
if
to
say
very
pretty
very
pretty
she
inspected
her
eyes
looked
at
her
teeth
raised
her
arms
placed
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
turned
her
profile
so
as
to
behold
her
entire
person
in
the
three
mirrors
bending
her
head
slightly
forward
she
stood
there
amorously
facing
herself
surrounded
by
the
threefold
reflection
of
her
own
being
which
she
thought
was
charming
filled
with
delight
at
sight
of
herself
engrossed
by
an
egotistical
and
physical
pleasure
in
presence
of
her
own
beauty
and
enjoying
it
with
a
keen
satisfaction
that
was
almost
as
sensual
as
a
man
every
day
she
surveyed
herself
in
this
manner
and
her
maid
who
had
often
caught
her
at
it
used
to
say
spitefully
madame
looks
at
herself
so
much
that
she
will
end
up
by
wearing
out
all
the
in
the
house
in
this
love
of
herself
however
lay
all
the
secret
of
her
charm
and
the
influence
that
she
exerted
over
men
through
admiring
herself
and
tenderly
loving
the
delicacy
of
her
features
and
the
elegance
of
her
form
by
constantly
seeking
for
and
finding
means
of
showing
them
to
the
greatest
advantage
through
discovering
imperceptible
ways
of
rendering
her
gracefulness
more
graceful
and
her
eyes
more
fascinating
through
pursuing
all
the
artifices
that
embellished
her
to
her
own
vision
she
had
as
a
matter
of
course
hit
upon
that
which
would
most
please
others
had
she
been
more
beautiful
and
careless
of
her
beauty
she
would
not
have
possessed
that
attractiveness
which
drew
to
her
everyone
who
had
not
from
the
beginning
shown
himself
unassailable
wearying
soon
a
little
of
standing
thus
she
spoke
to
her
image
that
was
smiling
to
her
still
and
her
image
in
the
threefold
mirror
moved
its
lips
as
if
to
echo
we
will
see
about
it
then
she
crossed
the
room
and
seated
herself
at
her
desk
here
is
what
she
wrote
dear
monsieur
mariolle
come
to
see
me
at
four
i
shall
be
alone
and
hope
to
be
able
to
reassure
you
as
to
the
imaginary
danger
that
alarms
you
i
subscribe
myself
your
friend
and
will
prove
to
you
that
i
am
michèle
de
burne
how
plainly
she
dressed
next
day
to
receive
andré
mariolle
visit
a
little
gray
dress
of
a
light
gray
bordering
on
lilac
melancholy
as
the
dying
day
and
quite
unornamented
with
a
collar
fitting
closely
to
the
neck
sleeves
fitting
closely
to
the
arms
corsage
fitting
closely
to
the
waist
and
bust
and
skirt
fitting
closely
to
the
hips
and
legs
when
he
made
his
appearance
wearing
rather
a
solemn
face
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
extending
both
her
hands
he
kissed
them
then
they
seated
themselves
and
she
allowed
the
silence
to
last
a
few
moments
in
order
to
assure
herself
of
his
embarrassment
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
so
well
let
us
come
at
once
to
the
main
question
what
is
the
matter
are
you
aware
that
you
wrote
me
a
very
insolent
letter
i
am
very
well
aware
of
it
and
i
render
my
most
sincere
apology
i
am
i
have
always
been
with
everyone
excessively
brutally
frank
i
might
have
gone
away
without
the
unnecessary
and
insulting
explanations
that
i
addressed
to
you
i
considered
it
more
loyal
to
act
in
accordance
with
my
nature
and
trust
to
your
understanding
with
which
i
am
acquainted
she
resumed
with
an
expression
of
pitying
satisfaction
come
come
what
does
all
this
folly
mean
he
interrupted
her
i
would
prefer
not
to
speak
of
it
she
answered
warmly
without
allowing
him
to
proceed
further
i
invited
you
here
to
discuss
it
and
we
will
discuss
it
until
you
are
quite
convinced
that
you
are
not
exposing
yourself
to
any
danger
she
laughed
like
a
little
girl
and
her
dress
so
closely
resembling
that
of
a
miss
gave
her
laughter
a
character
of
childish
youth
he
hesitatingly
said
what
i
wrote
you
was
the
truth
the
sincere
truth
the
terrifying
truth
resuming
her
seriousness
she
rejoined
i
do
not
doubt
you
all
my
friends
travel
that
road
you
also
wrote
that
i
am
a
fearful
coquette
i
admit
it
but
then
no
one
ever
dies
of
it
i
do
not
even
believe
that
they
suffer
a
great
deal
there
is
indeed
what
lamarthe
calls
the
crisis
you
are
in
that
stage
now
but
that
passes
over
and
subsides
into
what
shall
i
call
it
into
the
state
of
chronic
love
which
does
no
harm
to
a
body
and
which
i
keep
simmering
over
a
slow
fire
in
all
my
friends
so
that
they
may
be
very
much
attached
very
devoted
very
faithful
to
me
am
not
i
also
sincere
and
frank
and
nice
with
you
eh
have
you
known
many
women
who
would
dare
to
talk
as
i
have
talked
to
you
she
had
an
air
of
such
drollness
coupled
with
such
decision
she
was
so
unaffected
and
at
the
same
time
so
alluring
that
he
could
not
help
smiling
in
turn
all
your
friends
he
said
are
men
who
have
often
had
their
fingers
burned
in
that
fire
even
before
it
was
done
at
your
hearth
toasted
and
roasted
already
it
is
easy
for
them
to
endure
the
oven
in
which
you
keep
them
but
for
my
part
i
madame
have
never
passed
through
that
experience
and
i
have
felt
for
some
time
past
that
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
me
to
give
way
to
the
sentiment
that
is
growing
and
waxing
in
my
heart
suddenly
she
became
familiar
and
bending
a
little
toward
him
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
listen
to
me
she
said
i
am
in
earnest
i
hate
to
lose
a
friend
for
the
sake
of
a
fear
that
i
regard
as
chimerical
you
will
be
in
love
with
me
perhaps
but
the
men
of
this
generation
do
not
love
the
women
of
so
violently
as
to
do
themselves
any
actual
injury
you
may
believe
me
i
know
them
both
she
was
silent
then
with
the
singular
smile
of
a
woman
who
utters
a
truth
while
she
thinks
she
is
telling
a
fib
she
added
besides
i
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
to
make
men
love
me
madly
i
am
too
modern
come
i
will
be
a
friend
to
you
a
real
nice
friend
for
whom
you
will
have
affection
but
nothing
more
for
i
will
see
to
it
she
went
on
in
a
more
serious
tone
in
any
case
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
am
incapable
of
feeling
a
real
passion
for
anyone
let
him
be
who
he
may
you
shall
receive
the
same
treatment
as
the
others
you
shall
stand
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
most
favored
but
never
on
any
better
i
abominate
despotism
and
jealousy
i
have
had
to
endure
everything
from
a
husband
but
from
a
friend
a
simple
friend
i
do
not
choose
to
accept
affectionate
tyrannizings
which
are
the
bane
of
all
cordial
relations
you
see
that
i
am
just
as
nice
as
nice
can
be
that
i
talk
to
you
like
a
comrade
that
i
conceal
nothing
from
you
are
you
willing
loyally
to
accept
the
trial
that
i
propose
if
it
does
not
work
well
there
will
still
be
time
enough
for
you
to
go
away
if
the
gravity
of
the
situation
demands
it
a
lover
absent
is
a
lover
cured
he
looked
at
her
already
vanquished
by
her
voice
her
gestures
all
the
intoxication
of
her
person
and
quite
resigned
to
his
fate
and
thrilling
through
every
fiber
at
the
consciousness
that
she
was
sitting
there
beside
him
he
murmured
i
accept
madame
and
if
harm
comes
to
me
so
much
the
worse
i
can
afford
to
endure
a
little
suffering
for
your
sake
she
stopped
him
now
let
us
say
nothing
more
about
it
she
said
let
us
never
speak
of
it
again
and
she
diverted
the
conversation
to
topics
that
might
calm
his
agitation
in
an
hour
time
he
took
his
leave
in
torments
for
he
loved
her
delighted
for
she
had
asked
and
he
had
promised
that
he
would
not
go
away
chapter
iii
the
thorns
of
the
rose
he
was
in
torments
for
he
loved
her
differing
in
this
from
the
common
run
of
lovers
in
whose
eyes
the
woman
chosen
of
their
heart
appears
surrounded
by
an
aureole
of
perfection
his
attachment
for
her
had
grown
within
him
while
studying
her
with
the
clairvoyant
eyes
of
a
suspicious
and
distrustful
man
who
had
never
been
entirely
enslaved
his
timid
and
sluggish
but
penetrating
disposition
always
standing
on
the
defensive
in
life
had
saved
him
from
his
passions
a
few
intrigues
two
brief
that
had
perished
of
and
some
mercenary
loves
that
had
been
broken
off
from
disgust
comprised
the
history
of
his
heart
he
regarded
women
as
an
object
of
utility
for
those
who
desire
a
house
and
a
family
as
an
object
of
comparative
pleasure
to
those
who
are
in
quest
of
the
pastime
of
love
before
he
entered
mme
de
burne
house
his
friends
had
confidentially
warned
him
against
her
what
he
had
learned
of
her
interested
puzzled
and
pleased
him
but
it
was
also
rather
distasteful
to
him
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
did
not
like
those
gamblers
who
never
pay
when
they
lose
after
their
first
few
meetings
he
had
decided
that
she
was
very
amusing
and
that
she
possessed
a
special
charm
that
had
a
contagion
in
it
the
natural
and
artificial
beauties
of
this
charming
slender
blond
person
who
was
neither
fat
nor
lean
who
was
furnished
with
beautiful
arms
that
seemed
formed
to
attract
and
embrace
and
with
legs
that
one
might
imagine
long
and
tapering
calculated
for
flight
like
those
of
a
gazelle
with
feet
so
small
that
they
would
leave
no
trace
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
symbol
of
hopes
that
could
never
be
realized
he
had
experienced
moreover
in
his
conversation
with
her
a
pleasure
that
he
had
never
thought
of
meeting
with
in
the
intercourse
of
fashionable
society
gifted
with
a
wit
that
was
full
of
familiar
animation
unforeseen
and
mocking
and
of
a
caressing
irony
she
would
notwithstanding
this
sometimes
allow
herself
to
be
carried
away
by
sentimental
or
intellectual
influences
as
if
beneath
her
derisive
gaiety
there
still
lingered
the
secular
shade
of
poetic
tenderness
drawn
from
some
remote
ancestress
these
things
combined
to
render
her
exquisite
she
petted
him
and
made
much
of
him
desirous
of
conquering
him
as
she
had
conquered
the
others
and
he
visited
her
house
as
often
as
he
could
drawn
thither
by
his
increasing
need
of
seeing
more
of
her
it
was
like
a
force
emanating
from
her
and
taking
possession
of
him
a
force
that
lay
in
her
charm
her
look
her
smile
her
speech
a
force
that
there
was
no
resisting
although
he
frequently
left
her
house
provoked
at
something
that
she
had
said
or
done
the
more
he
felt
working
on
him
that
indescribable
influence
with
which
a
woman
penetrates
and
subjugates
us
the
more
clearly
did
he
see
through
her
the
more
did
he
understand
and
suffer
from
her
nature
which
he
devoutly
wished
was
different
it
was
certainly
true
however
that
the
very
qualities
which
he
disapproved
of
in
her
were
the
qualities
that
had
drawn
him
toward
her
and
captivated
him
in
spite
of
himself
in
spite
of
his
reason
and
more
perhaps
than
her
real
merits
her
coquetry
with
which
she
toyed
making
no
attempt
at
concealing
it
as
with
a
fan
opening
and
folding
it
in
presence
of
everybody
according
as
the
men
to
whom
she
was
talking
were
pleasing
to
her
or
the
reverse
her
way
of
taking
nothing
in
earnest
which
had
seemed
droll
to
him
upon
their
first
acquaintance
but
now
seemed
threatening
her
constant
desire
for
distraction
for
novelty
which
rested
insatiable
in
her
heart
always
weary
all
these
things
would
so
exasperate
him
that
sometimes
upon
returning
to
his
house
he
would
resolve
to
make
his
visits
to
her
more
infrequent
until
such
time
as
he
might
do
away
with
them
altogether
the
very
next
day
he
would
invent
some
pretext
for
going
to
see
her
what
he
thought
to
impress
upon
himself
as
he
became
more
and
more
enamored
was
the
insecurity
of
this
love
and
the
certainty
that
he
would
have
to
suffer
for
it
he
was
not
blind
little
by
little
he
yielded
to
this
sentiment
as
a
man
drowns
because
his
vessel
has
gone
down
under
him
and
he
is
too
far
from
the
shore
he
knew
her
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
know
her
for
his
passion
had
served
to
make
his
mental
vision
abnormally
clairvoyant
and
he
could
not
prevent
his
thoughts
from
going
into
indefinite
speculations
concerning
her
with
indefatigable
perseverance
he
was
continually
seeking
to
analyze
and
understand
the
obscure
depths
of
this
feminine
soul
this
incomprehensible
mixture
of
bright
intelligence
and
disenchantment
of
sober
reason
and
childish
triviality
of
apparent
affection
and
fickleness
of
all
those
inclinations
that
can
be
brought
together
and
to
form
an
unnatural
perplexing
and
seductive
being
but
why
was
it
that
she
attracted
him
thus
he
constantly
asked
himself
this
question
and
was
unable
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
it
for
with
his
reflective
observing
and
proudly
retiring
nature
his
logical
course
would
have
been
to
look
in
a
woman
for
those
and
soothing
attributes
of
tenderness
and
constancy
which
seem
to
offer
the
most
reliable
assurance
of
happiness
to
a
man
in
her
however
he
had
encountered
something
that
he
had
not
expected
to
find
a
sort
of
early
vegetable
of
the
human
race
as
it
were
one
of
those
creatures
who
are
the
beginning
of
a
new
generation
exciting
one
by
their
strange
novelty
unlike
anything
that
one
has
ever
known
before
and
even
in
their
imperfections
awakening
the
dormant
senses
by
a
formidable
power
of
attraction
to
the
romantic
and
dreamily
passionate
women
of
the
restoration
had
succeeded
the
gay
triflers
of
the
imperial
epoch
convinced
that
pleasure
is
a
reality
and
now
here
there
was
afforded
him
a
new
development
of
this
everlasting
femininity
a
woman
of
refinement
of
indeterminate
sensibility
restless
without
fixed
resolves
her
feelings
in
constant
turmoil
who
seemed
to
have
made
it
part
of
her
experience
to
employ
every
narcotic
that
quiets
the
aching
nerves
chloroform
that
stupefies
ether
and
morphine
that
excite
to
abnormal
reverie
kill
the
senses
and
deaden
the
emotions
he
relished
in
her
that
flavor
of
an
artificial
nature
the
sole
object
of
whose
existence
was
to
charm
and
allure
she
was
a
rare
and
attractive
bauble
exquisite
and
delicate
drawing
men
eyes
to
her
causing
the
heart
to
throb
and
desire
to
awake
as
one
appetite
is
excited
when
he
looks
through
the
glass
of
the
and
beholds
the
dainty
viands
that
have
been
prepared
and
arranged
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
hunger
for
them
when
he
was
quite
assured
that
he
had
started
on
his
perilous
descent
toward
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
he
began
to
reflect
with
consternation
upon
the
dangers
of
his
infatuation
what
would
happen
him
what
would
she
do
with
him
most
assuredly
she
would
do
with
him
what
she
had
done
with
everyone
else
she
would
bring
him
to
the
point
where
a
man
follows
a
woman
capricious
fancies
as
a
dog
follows
his
steps
and
she
would
classify
him
among
her
collection
of
more
or
less
illustrious
favorites
had
she
really
played
this
game
with
all
the
others
was
there
not
one
not
a
single
one
whom
she
had
loved
if
only
for
a
month
a
day
an
hour
in
one
of
those
effusions
of
feeling
that
she
had
the
faculty
of
repressing
so
readily
he
talked
with
them
interminably
about
her
as
they
came
forth
from
her
dinners
warmed
by
contact
with
her
he
felt
that
they
were
all
uneasy
dissatisfied
unstrung
like
men
whose
dreams
have
failed
of
realization
no
she
had
loved
no
one
among
these
paraders
before
public
curiosity
but
he
who
was
a
nullity
in
comparison
with
them
he
to
whom
it
was
not
granted
that
heads
should
turn
and
wondering
eyes
be
fixed
on
him
when
his
name
was
mentioned
in
a
crowd
or
in
a
salon
what
would
he
be
for
her
nothing
nothing
a
mere
supernumerary
upon
her
scene
a
monsieur
the
sort
of
man
that
becomes
a
familiar
commonplace
attendant
upon
a
distinguished
woman
useful
to
hold
her
bouquet
a
man
comparable
to
the
common
grade
of
wine
that
one
drinks
with
water
had
he
been
a
famous
man
he
might
have
been
willing
to
accept
this
rôle
which
his
celebrity
would
have
made
less
humiliating
but
unknown
as
he
was
he
would
have
none
of
it
so
he
wrote
to
bid
her
farewell
when
he
received
her
brief
answer
he
was
moved
by
it
as
by
the
intelligence
of
some
unexpected
piece
of
good
fortune
and
when
she
had
made
him
promise
that
he
would
not
go
away
he
was
as
delighted
as
a
schoolboy
released
for
a
holiday
several
days
elapsed
without
bringing
any
fresh
development
to
their
relations
but
when
the
calm
that
succeeds
the
storm
had
passed
he
felt
his
longing
for
her
increasing
within
him
and
burning
him
he
had
promised
that
he
would
never
again
speak
to
her
on
the
forbidden
topic
but
he
had
not
promised
that
he
would
not
write
and
one
night
when
he
could
not
sleep
when
she
had
taken
possession
of
all
his
faculties
in
the
restless
vigil
of
his
insomnia
of
love
he
seated
himself
at
his
table
almost
against
his
will
and
set
himself
to
put
down
his
feelings
and
his
sufferings
upon
fair
white
paper
it
was
not
a
letter
it
was
an
aggregation
of
notes
phrases
thoughts
throbs
of
moral
anguish
transmuting
themselves
into
words
it
soothed
him
it
seemed
to
him
to
give
him
a
little
comfort
in
his
suffering
and
lying
down
upon
his
bed
he
was
at
last
able
to
obtain
some
sleep
upon
awaking
the
next
morning
he
read
over
these
few
pages
and
decided
that
they
were
sufficiently
harrowing
then
he
inclosed
and
addressed
them
kept
them
by
him
until
evening
and
mailed
them
very
late
so
that
she
might
receive
them
when
she
arose
he
thought
that
she
would
not
be
alarmed
by
these
innocent
sheets
of
paper
the
most
timorous
of
women
have
an
infinite
kindness
for
a
letter
that
speaks
to
them
of
a
sincere
love
and
when
these
letters
are
written
by
a
trembling
hand
with
tearful
eyes
and
melancholy
face
the
power
that
they
exercise
over
the
female
heart
is
unbounded
he
went
to
her
house
late
that
afternoon
to
see
how
she
would
receive
him
and
what
she
would
say
to
him
he
found
de
pradon
there
smoking
cigarettes
and
conversing
with
his
daughter
he
would
often
pass
whole
hours
with
her
in
this
way
for
his
manner
toward
her
was
rather
that
of
a
gentleman
visitor
than
of
a
father
she
had
brought
into
their
relations
and
their
affection
a
tinge
of
that
homage
of
love
which
she
bestowed
upon
herself
and
exacted
from
everyone
else
when
she
beheld
mariolle
her
face
brightened
with
delight
she
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
and
her
smile
told
him
you
have
afforded
me
much
pleasure
mariolle
was
in
hopes
that
the
father
would
go
away
soon
but
de
pradon
did
not
budge
although
he
knew
his
daughter
thoroughly
and
for
a
long
time
past
had
placed
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
her
as
regarded
her
relations
with
men
he
always
kept
an
eye
on
her
with
a
kind
of
curious
uneasy
somewhat
marital
attention
he
wanted
to
know
what
chance
of
success
there
might
be
for
this
newly
discovered
friend
who
he
was
what
he
amounted
to
would
he
be
a
mere
bird
of
passage
like
so
many
others
or
a
permanent
member
of
their
usual
circle
he
intrenched
himself
therefore
and
mariolle
immediately
perceived
that
he
was
not
to
be
dislodged
the
visitor
made
up
his
mind
accordingly
and
even
resolved
to
gain
him
over
if
it
were
possible
considering
that
his
or
at
any
rate
his
neutrality
would
be
better
than
his
hostility
he
exerted
himself
and
was
brilliant
and
amusing
without
any
of
the
airs
of
a
sighing
lover
she
said
to
herself
contentedly
he
is
not
stupid
he
acts
his
part
in
the
comedy
extremely
well
and
de
pradon
thought
this
is
a
very
agreeable
man
whose
head
my
daughter
does
not
seem
to
have
turned
when
mariolle
decided
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
take
his
leave
he
left
them
both
delighted
with
him
but
he
left
that
house
with
sorrow
in
his
soul
in
the
presence
of
that
woman
he
felt
deeply
the
bondage
in
which
she
held
him
realizing
that
it
would
be
vain
to
knock
at
that
heart
as
a
man
imprisoned
fruitlessly
beats
the
iron
door
with
his
fist
he
was
well
assured
that
he
was
entirely
in
her
power
and
he
did
not
try
to
free
himself
such
being
the
case
and
as
he
could
not
avoid
this
fatality
he
resolved
that
he
would
be
patient
tenacious
cunning
dissembling
that
he
would
conquer
by
address
by
the
homage
that
she
was
so
greedy
of
by
the
adoration
that
intoxicated
her
by
the
voluntary
servitude
to
which
he
would
suffer
himself
to
be
reduced
his
letter
had
pleased
her
he
would
write
he
wrote
almost
every
night
when
he
came
home
at
that
hour
when
the
mind
fresh
from
the
influence
of
the
day
occurrences
regards
whatever
interests
or
moves
it
with
a
sort
of
abnormally
developed
hallucination
he
would
seat
himself
at
his
table
by
his
lamp
and
exalt
his
imagination
by
thoughts
of
her
the
poetic
germ
that
so
many
indolent
men
suffer
to
perish
within
them
from
mere
slothfulness
grew
and
throve
under
this
regimen
he
infused
a
feverish
ardor
into
this
task
of
literary
tenderness
by
means
of
constantly
writing
the
same
thing
the
same
idea
that
is
his
love
in
expressions
that
were
ever
renewed
by
the
constantly
daily
renewal
of
his
desire
all
through
the
long
day
he
would
seek
for
and
find
those
irresistible
words
that
stream
from
the
brain
like
fiery
sparks
compelled
by
the
emotions
thus
he
would
breathe
upon
the
fire
of
his
own
heart
and
kindle
it
into
raging
flames
for
often
contain
more
danger
for
him
who
writes
than
for
her
who
receives
them
by
keeping
himself
in
this
continuous
state
of
effervescence
by
heating
his
blood
with
words
and
peopling
his
brain
with
one
solitary
thought
his
ideas
gradually
became
confused
as
to
the
reality
of
this
woman
he
had
ceased
to
entertain
the
opinion
of
her
that
he
had
first
held
and
now
beheld
her
only
through
the
medium
of
his
own
lyrical
phrases
and
all
that
he
wrote
of
her
night
by
night
became
to
his
heart
so
many
gospel
truths
this
daily
labor
of
idealization
displayed
her
to
him
as
in
a
dream
his
former
resistance
melted
away
moreover
in
presence
of
the
affection
that
mme
de
burne
undeniably
evinced
for
him
although
no
word
had
passed
between
them
at
this
time
she
certainly
showed
a
preference
for
him
beyond
others
and
took
no
pains
to
conceal
it
from
him
he
therefore
thought
with
a
kind
of
mad
hope
that
she
might
finally
come
to
love
him
the
fact
was
that
the
charm
of
those
letters
afforded
her
a
complicated
and
naïve
delight
no
one
had
ever
flattered
and
caressed
her
in
that
manner
with
such
mute
reserve
no
one
had
ever
had
the
delicious
idea
of
sending
to
her
bedside
every
morning
that
feast
of
sentiment
in
paper
wrapping
that
her
maid
presented
to
her
on
the
little
silver
salver
and
what
made
it
all
the
dearer
in
her
eyes
was
that
he
never
mentioned
it
that
he
seemed
to
be
quite
unaware
of
it
himself
that
when
he
visited
her
salon
he
was
the
most
undemonstrative
of
her
friends
that
he
never
by
word
or
look
alluded
to
those
showers
of
tenderness
that
he
was
secretly
raining
down
upon
her
of
course
she
had
had
before
that
but
they
had
been
pitched
in
a
different
key
had
been
less
reserved
more
pressing
more
like
a
summons
to
surrender
for
the
three
months
that
his
crisis
had
lasted
lamarthe
had
dedicated
to
her
a
very
nice
correspondence
from
a
novelist
who
maunders
in
a
literary
way
she
kept
in
her
secretary
in
a
drawer
specially
allotted
to
them
these
delicate
and
seductive
epistles
from
a
writer
who
had
shown
much
feeling
who
had
caressed
her
with
his
pen
up
to
the
very
day
when
he
saw
that
he
had
no
hope
of
success
mariolle
letters
were
quite
different
they
were
so
strong
in
their
concentrated
desire
so
deep
in
the
expression
of
their
sincerity
so
humble
in
their
submissiveness
breathing
a
devotion
that
promised
to
be
lasting
that
she
received
and
read
them
with
a
delight
that
no
other
writings
could
have
afforded
her
it
was
natural
that
her
friendly
feeling
for
the
man
should
increase
under
such
conditions
she
invited
him
to
her
house
the
more
frequently
because
he
displayed
such
entire
reserve
in
his
relations
toward
her
seeming
not
to
have
the
slightest
recollection
in
conversation
with
her
that
he
had
ever
taken
up
a
sheet
of
paper
to
tell
her
of
his
adoration
moreover
she
looked
upon
the
situation
as
an
original
one
worthy
of
being
celebrated
in
a
book
and
in
the
depths
of
her
satisfaction
in
having
at
her
side
a
being
who
loved
her
thus
she
experienced
a
sort
of
active
fermentation
of
sympathy
which
caused
her
to
measure
him
by
a
standard
other
than
her
usual
one
up
to
the
present
time
notwithstanding
the
vanity
of
her
coquetry
she
had
been
conscious
of
preoccupations
that
antagonized
her
in
all
the
hearts
that
she
had
laid
waste
she
had
not
held
undisputed
sovereignty
over
them
she
had
found
in
them
powerful
interests
that
were
entirely
dissociated
from
her
jealous
of
music
in
massival
case
of
literature
in
lamarthe
always
jealous
of
something
discontented
that
she
only
obtained
partial
successes
powerless
to
drive
all
before
her
in
the
minds
of
these
ambitious
men
men
of
celebrity
or
artists
to
whom
their
profession
was
a
mistress
from
whom
nobody
could
part
them
she
had
now
for
the
first
time
fallen
in
with
one
to
whom
she
was
all
in
all
certainly
big
fresnel
and
he
alone
loved
her
to
the
same
degree
but
then
he
was
big
fresnel
she
felt
that
it
had
never
been
granted
her
to
exercise
such
complete
dominion
over
anyone
and
her
selfish
gratitude
for
the
man
who
had
afforded
her
this
triumph
displayed
itself
in
manifestations
of
tenderness
she
had
need
of
him
now
she
had
need
of
his
presence
of
his
glance
of
his
subjection
of
all
this
domesticity
of
love
if
he
flattered
her
vanity
less
than
the
others
did
he
flattered
more
those
supreme
exactions
that
sway
coquettes
body
and
soul
her
pride
and
her
instinct
of
domination
her
strong
instinct
of
feminine
repose
like
an
invader
she
gradually
assumed
possession
of
his
life
by
a
series
of
small
incursions
that
every
day
became
more
numerous
she
got
up
and
dinners
at
the
restaurant
so
that
he
might
be
of
the
party
she
dragged
him
after
her
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
conqueror
she
could
not
dispense
with
his
presence
or
rather
with
the
state
of
slavery
to
which
he
was
reduced
he
followed
in
her
train
happy
to
feel
himself
thus
petted
caressed
by
her
eyes
her
voice
by
her
every
caprice
and
he
lived
only
in
a
continuous
transport
of
love
and
longing
that
desolated
and
burned
like
a
wasting
fever
chapter
iv
the
benefit
of
change
of
scene
one
day
mariolle
had
gone
to
her
house
he
was
awaiting
her
for
she
had
not
come
in
although
she
had
sent
him
a
telegram
to
tell
him
that
she
wanted
to
see
him
that
morning
whenever
he
was
alone
in
this
which
it
gave
him
such
pleasure
to
enter
and
where
everything
was
so
charming
to
him
he
nevertheless
was
conscious
of
an
oppression
of
the
heart
a
slight
feeling
of
affright
and
breathlessness
that
would
not
allow
him
to
remain
seated
as
long
as
she
was
not
there
he
walked
about
the
room
in
joyful
expectation
dashed
by
the
fear
that
some
unforeseen
obstacle
might
intervene
to
detain
her
and
cause
their
interview
to
go
over
until
next
day
his
heart
gave
a
hopeful
bound
when
he
heard
a
carriage
draw
up
before
the
street
door
and
when
the
bell
of
the
apartment
rang
he
ceased
to
doubt
she
came
in
with
her
hat
on
a
thing
which
she
was
not
accustomed
to
do
wearing
a
busy
and
satisfied
look
i
have
some
news
for
you
she
said
what
is
it
madame
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
well
i
am
going
to
the
country
for
a
while
her
words
produced
in
him
a
quick
sharp
shock
of
sorrow
that
was
reflected
upon
his
face
oh
and
you
tell
me
that
as
if
you
were
glad
of
it
yes
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
do
know
whether
you
are
aware
that
valsaci
my
poor
mother
brother
the
engineer
and
has
a
at
avranches
where
he
spends
a
portion
of
his
time
with
his
wife
and
children
for
his
business
lies
mostly
in
that
neighborhood
we
pay
them
a
visit
every
summer
this
year
i
said
that
i
did
not
care
to
go
but
he
was
greatly
disappointed
and
made
quite
a
time
over
it
with
papa
speaking
of
scenes
i
will
tell
you
confidentially
that
papa
is
jealous
of
you
and
makes
scenes
with
me
too
he
says
that
i
am
entangling
myself
with
you
you
will
have
to
come
to
see
me
less
frequently
but
do
let
that
trouble
you
i
will
arrange
matters
so
papa
gave
me
a
scolding
and
made
me
promise
to
go
to
avranches
for
a
visit
of
ten
days
perhaps
twelve
we
are
to
start
tuesday
morning
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it
i
say
that
it
breaks
my
heart
is
that
all
what
more
can
i
say
there
is
no
way
of
preventing
you
from
going
and
nothing
presents
itself
to
you
why

public
garden

a
party

malo
and
a
week
later
i
shall
be
back
in
paris
is
that
an
ingenious
scheme
am
i
not
nice
with
an
outburst
of
grateful
feeling
he
murmured
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
hush
said
she
they
looked
each
other
for
a
moment
in
the
face
she
smiled
conveying
to
him
in
that
smile
very
sincere
and
earnest
it
was
almost
tender
all
her
gratitude
her
thanks
for
his
love
and
her
sympathy
as
well
he
gazed
upon
her
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
devour
her
he
had
an
insane
desire
to
throw
himself
down
and
grovel
at
her
feet
to
kiss
the
hem
of
her
robe
to
cry
aloud
and
make
her
see
what
he
knew
not
how
to
tell
in
words
what
existed
in
all
his
form
from
head
to
feet
in
every
fiber
of
his
body
as
well
as
in
his
heart
paining
him
inexpressibly
because
he
could
not
display
it
his
love
his
terrible
and
delicious
love
there
was
no
need
of
words
however
she
understood
him
as
the
marksman
instinctively
feels
that
his
ball
has
penetrated
the
of
the
target
nothing
any
longer
subsisted
within
this
man
nothing
nothing
but
her
image
he
was
hers
more
than
she
herself
was
her
own
she
was
satisfied
and
she
thought
he
was
charming
she
said
to
him
in
high
then
is
settled
the
excursion
is
agreed
on
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
emotion
why
yes
madame
it
is
agreed
on
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
i
can
not
let
you
stay
any
longer
she
said
without
further
apology
i
only
ran
in
to
tell
you
what
i
have
told
you
since
i
am
to
start
day
after
all
my
time
will
be
occupied
and
i
have
still
things
to
attend
to
before
he
arose
at
once
deeply
troubled
for
the
sole
desire
of
his
heart
was
to
be
with
her
always
and
having
kissed
her
hands
went
his
way
sore
at
heart
but
hopeful
nevertheless
the
four
intervening
days
were
horribly
long
ones
to
him
he
got
through
them
somehow
in
paris
without
seeing
a
soul
preferring
silence
to
conversation
and
solitude
to
the
company
of
friends
on
friday
morning
therefore
he
boarded
the
express
the
anticipation
of
the
journey
had
made
him
feverish
and
he
had
not
slept
a
wink
the
darkness
of
his
room
and
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
occasional
rattling
of
some
belated
cab
that
served
to
remind
him
of
his
longing
to
be
off
had
weighed
upon
him
all
night
long
like
a
prison
at
the
earliest
ray
of
light
that
showed
itself
between
his
drawn
curtains
the
gray
sad
light
of
early
morning
he
jumped
from
his
bed
opened
the
window
and
looked
at
the
sky
he
had
been
haunted
by
the
fear
that
the
weather
might
be
unfavorable
it
was
clear
there
was
a
light
floating
mist
presaging
a
warm
day
he
dressed
more
quickly
than
was
needful
and
in
his
consuming
impatience
to
get
out
of
doors
and
at
last
begin
his
journey
he
was
ready
two
hours
too
soon
and
nothing
would
do
but
his
valet
must
go
out
and
get
a
cab
lest
they
should
all
be
gone
from
the
stand
as
the
vehicle
jolted
over
the
stones
its
movements
were
so
many
shocks
of
happiness
to
him
but
when
he
reached
the
mont
parnasse
station
and
found
that
he
had
fifty
minutes
to
wait
before
the
departure
of
the
train
his
spirits
fell
again
there
was
a
compartment
disengaged
he
took
it
so
that
he
might
be
alone
and
give
free
course
to
his
reveries
when
at
last
he
felt
himself
moving
hurrying
along
toward
her
soothed
by
the
gentle
and
rapid
motion
of
the
train
his
eagerness
instead
of
being
appeased
was
still
further
excited
and
he
felt
a
desire
the
unreasoning
desire
of
a
child
to
push
with
all
his
strength
against
the
partition
in
front
of
him
so
as
to
accelerate
their
speed
for
a
long
time
until
midday
he
remained
in
this
condition
of
waiting
expectancy
but
when
they
were
past
argentan
his
eyes
were
gradually
attracted
to
the
window
by
the
fresh
verdure
of
the
norman
landscape
the
train
was
passing
through
a
wide
undulating
region
intersected
by
valleys
where
the
peasant
holdings
mostly
in
grass
and
were
shut
in
by
great
trees
the
tops
of
which
seemed
to
glow
in
the
sunlight
it
was
late
in
july
that
lusty
season
when
this
land
an
abundant
nurse
gives
generously
of
its
sap
and
life
in
all
the
inclosures
separated
from
each
other
by
these
leafy
walls
great
oxen
cows
whose
flanks
were
striped
with
undefined
figures
of
odd
design
huge
red
bulls
of
proud
and
quarrelsome
aspect
with
their
hanging
dewlaps
of
hairy
flesh
standing
by
the
fences
or
lying
down
among
the
pasturage
that
stuffed
their
paunches
succeeded
each
other
until
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
them
in
this
fresh
fertile
land
the
soil
of
which
appeared
to
exude
cider
and
fat
sirloins
in
every
direction
little
streams
were
gliding
in
and
out
among
the
poplars
partially
concealed
by
a
thin
screen
of
willows
brooks
glittered
for
an
instant
among
the
herbage
disappearing
only
to
show
themselves
again
farther
on
bathing
all
the
scene
in
their
vivifying
coolness
mariolle
was
charmed
at
the
sight
and
almost
forgot
his
love
for
a
moment
in
his
rapid
flight
through
this
park
of
and
flocks
and
herds
when
he
had
changed
cars
at
folligny
station
however
he
was
again
seized
with
an
impatient
longing
to
be
at
his
destination
and
during
the
last
forty
minutes
he
took
out
his
watch
twenty
times
his
head
was
constantly
turned
toward
the
window
of
the
car
and
at
last
situated
upon
a
hill
of
moderate
height
he
beheld
the
city
where
she
was
waiting
for
his
coming
the
train
had
been
delayed
and
now
only
an
hour
separated
him
from
the
moment
when
he
was
to
come
upon
her
by
chance
on
the
public
promenade
he
was
the
only
passenger
that
climbed
into
the
hotel
omnibus
which
the
horses
began
to
drag
up
the
steep
road
of
avranches
with
slow
and
reluctant
steps
the
houses
crowning
the
heights
gave
to
the
place
from
a
distance
the
appearance
of
a
fortification
seen
close
at
hand
it
was
an
ancient
and
pretty
norman
city
with
small
dwellings
of
regular
and
almost
similar
appearance
built
closely
adjoining
one
another
giving
an
aspect
of
ancient
pride
and
modern
comfort
a
feudal
yet
air
as
soon
as
mariolle
had
secured
a
room
and
thrown
his
valise
into
it
he
inquired
for
the
street
that
led
to
the
botanical
garden
and
started
off
in
the
direction
indicated
with
rapid
strides
although
he
was
ahead
of
time
but
he
was
in
hopes
that
perhaps
she
also
would
be
on
hand
early
when
he
reached
the
iron
railings
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
place
was
empty
or
nearly
so
only
three
old
men
were
walking
about
in
it
to
the
manner
born
who
probably
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
there
daily
to
cheer
their
leisure
by
conversation
and
a
family
of
english
children
boys
and
girls
were
playing
about
a
governess
whose
wandering
looks
showed
that
her
thoughts
were
far
away
mariolle
walked
straight
ahead
with
beating
heart
looking
scrutinizingly
up
and
down
the
intersecting
paths
he
came
to
a
great
alley
of
dark
green
elms
which
cut
the
garden
in
two
portions
crosswise
and
stretched
away
in
its
center
a
dense
vault
of
foliage
he
passed
through
this
and
all
at
once
coming
to
a
terrace
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
horizon
his
thoughts
suddenly
ceased
to
dwell
upon
her
whose
influence
had
brought
him
hither
from
the
foot
of
the
elevation
upon
which
he
was
standing
spread
an
illimitable
sandy
plain
that
stretched
away
in
the
distance
and
blended
with
sea
and
sky
through
it
rolled
a
stream
and
beneath
the
azure
aflame
with
sunlight
pools
of
water
dotted
it
with
luminous
sheets
that
seemed
like
orifices
opening
upon
another
sky
beneath
in
the
midst
of
this
yellow
desert
still
wet
and
glistening
with
the
receding
tide
at
twelve
or
fifteen
kilometers
from
the
shore
rose
a
pointed
rock
of
monumental
profile
like
some
fantastic
pyramid
surmounted
by
a
cathedral
its
only
neighbor
in
these
immense
wastes
was
a
low
round
backed
reef
that
the
tide
had
left
uncovered
squatting
among
the
shifting
ooze
the
reef
of
tombelaine
farther
still
away
other
submerged
rocks
showed
their
brown
heads
above
the
bluish
line
of
the
waves
and
the
eye
continuing
to
follow
the
horizon
to
the
right
finally
rested
upon
the
vast
green
expanse
of
the
norman
country
lying
beside
this
sandy
waste
so
densely
covered
with
trees
that
it
had
the
aspect
of
a
limitless
forest
it
was
all
nature
offering
herself
to
his
vision
at
a
single
glance
in
a
single
spot
in
all
her
might
and
grandeur
in
all
her
grace
and
freshness
and
the
eye
turned
from
those
woodland
glimpses
to
the
stern
apparition
of
the
granite
mount
the
hermit
of
the
sands
rearing
its
strange
gothic
form
upon
the
strand
the
strange
pleasure
which
in
other
days
had
often
made
mariolle
thrill
in
the
presence
of
the
surprises
that
unknown
lands
preserve
to
delight
the
eyes
of
travelers
now
took
such
sudden
possession
of
him
that
he
remained
motionless
his
feelings
softened
and
deeply
moved
oblivious
of
his
tortured
heart
at
the
sound
of
a
striking
bell
however
he
turned
suddenly
repossessed
by
the
eager
hope
that
they
were
about
to
meet
the
garden
was
still
almost
untenanted
the
english
children
had
gone
the
three
old
men
alone
kept
up
their
monotonous
promenade
he
came
down
and
began
to
walk
about
like
them
immediately
in
a
moment
she
would
be
there
he
would
see
her
at
the
end
of
one
of
those
roads
that
centered
in
this
wondrous
terrace
he
would
recognize
her
form
her
step
then
her
face
and
her
smile
he
would
soon
be
listening
to
her
voice
what
happiness
what
delight
he
felt
that
she
was
near
him
somewhere
invisible
as
yet
but
thinking
of
him
knowing
that
she
was
soon
to
see
him
again
with
difficulty
he
restrained
himself
from
uttering
a
little
cry
for
there
down
below
a
blue
sunshade
just
the
dome
of
a
sunshade
was
visible
gliding
along
beneath
a
clump
of
trees
it
must
be
she
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
a
little
boy
came
in
sight
driving
a
hoop
before
him
then
two
ladies
he
recognized
her
then
two
men
her
father
and
another
gentleman
she
was
all
in
blue
like
the
heavens
in
springtime
yes
indeed
he
recognized
her
while
as
yet
he
could
not
distinguish
her
features
but
he
did
not
dare
to
go
toward
her
feeling
that
he
would
blush
and
stammer
that
he
would
be
unable
to
account
for
this
chance
meeting
beneath
de
pradon
suspicious
glances
he
went
forward
to
meet
them
however
keeping
his
to
his
eye
apparently
quite
intent
on
scanning
the
horizon
she
it
was
who
addressed
him
first
not
even
taking
the
trouble
to
affect
astonishment
good
day
mariolle
she
said
is
it
splendid
he
was
struck
speechless
by
this
reception
and
knew
not
what
tone
to
adopt
in
reply
finally
he
stammered
ah
it
is
you
madame
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
you
i
wanted
to
see
something
of
this
delightful
country
she
smiled
as
she
replied
and
you
selected
the
very
time
when
i
chanced
to
be
here
that
was
extremely
kind
of
you
then
she
proceeded
to
make
the
necessary
introductions
this
is
mariolle
one
of
my
dearest
friends
my
aunt
mme
valsaci
my
uncle
who
builds
bridges
when
salutations
had
been
exchanged
de
pradon
and
the
young
man
shook
hands
rather
stiffly
and
the
walk
was
continued
she
had
made
room
for
him
between
herself
and
her
aunt
casting
upon
him
a
very
rapid
glance
one
of
those
glances
which
seem
to
indicate
a
weakening
determination
how
do
you
like
the
country
she
asked
i
think
that
i
have
never
beheld
anything
more
beautiful
he
replied
ah
if
you
had
passed
some
days
here
as
i
have
just
been
doing
you
would
feel
how
it
penetrates
one
the
impression
that
it
leaves
is
beyond
the
power
of
expression
the
advance
and
retreat
of
the
sea
upon
the
sands
that
grand
movement
that
is
going
on
unceasingly
that
twice
a
day
floods
all
that
you
behold
before
you
and
so
swiftly
that
a
horse
galloping
at
top
speed
would
scarce
have
time
to
escape
before
it
this
wondrous
spectacle
that
heaven
gratuitously
displays
before
us
i
declare
to
you
that
it
makes
me
forgetful
of
myself
i
no
longer
know
myself
am
i
not
speaking
the
truth
aunt
mme
valsaci
an
old
woman
a
lady
of
distinction
in
her
province
and
the
respected
wife
of
an
eminent
engineer
a
supercilious
functionary
who
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
arrogance
of
the
school
confessed
that
she
had
never
seen
her
niece
in
such
a
state
of
enthusiasm
then
she
added
reflectively
it
is
not
surprising
however
when
like
her
one
has
never
seen
any
but
theatrical
scenery
but
i
go
to
dieppe
and
trouville
almost
every
year
the
old
lady
began
to
laugh
people
only
go
to
dieppe
and
trouville
to
see
their
friends
the
sea
is
only
there
to
serve
as
a
cloak
for
their
rendezvous
it
was
very
simply
said
perhaps
without
any
concealed
meaning
people
were
streaming
along
toward
the
terrace
which
seemed
to
draw
them
to
it
with
an
irresistible
attraction
they
came
from
every
quarter
of
the
garden
in
spite
of
themselves
like
round
bodies
rolling
down
a
slope
the
sinking
sun
seemed
to
be
drawing
a
golden
tissue
of
finest
texture
transparent
and
ethereally
light
behind
the
lofty
silhouette
of
the
abbey
which
was
growing
darker
and
darker
like
a
gigantic
shrine
relieved
against
a
veil
of
brightness
mariolle
however
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
adored
blond
form
walking
at
his
side
wrapped
in
its
cloud
of
blue
never
had
he
beheld
her
so
seductive
she
seemed
to
him
to
have
changed
without
his
being
able
to
specify
in
what
the
change
consisted
she
was
bright
with
a
brightness
he
had
never
seen
before
which
shone
in
her
eyes
and
upon
her
flesh
her
hair
and
seemed
to
have
penetrated
her
soul
as
well
a
brightness
emanating
from
this
country
this
sky
this
sunlight
this
verdure
never
had
he
known
or
loved
her
thus
he
walked
at
her
side
and
could
find
no
word
to
say
to
her
the
rustle
of
her
dress
the
occasional
touch
of
her
arm
the
meeting
so
mutely
eloquent
of
their
glances
completely
overcame
him
he
felt
as
if
they
had
annihilated
his
personality
as
a
man
felt
himself
suddenly
obliterated
by
contact
with
this
woman
absorbed
by
her
to
such
an
extent
as
to
be
nothing
nothing
but
desire
nothing
but
appeal
nothing
but
adoration
she
had
consumed
his
being
as
one
burns
a
letter
she
saw
it
all
very
clearly
understood
the
full
extent
of
her
victory
and
thrilled
and
deeply
moved
feeling
life
throb
within
her
too
more
keenly
among
these
odors
of
the
country
and
the
sea
full
of
sunlight
and
of
sap
she
said
to
him
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
close
upon
this
she
asked
how
long
do
you
remain
here
he
replied
two
days
if
counts
for
a
day
then
turning
to
the
aunt
would
mme
valsaci
do
me
the
honor
to
come
and
spend
the
day
at
mont
with
her
husband
mme
de
burne
made
answer
for
her
relative
i
will
not
allow
her
to
refuse
since
we
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
you
here
the
engineer
wife
replied
yes
monsieur
i
accept
very
gladly
upon
the
condition
that
you
come
and
dine
with
me
this
evening
he
bowed
in
assent
all
at
once
there
arose
within
him
a
feeling
of
delirious
delight
such
a
joy
as
seizes
you
when
news
is
brought
that
the
desire
of
your
life
is
attained
what
had
come
to
him
what
new
occurrence
was
there
in
his
life
nothing
and
yet
he
felt
himself
carried
away
by
the
intoxication
of
an
indefinable
presentiment
they
walked
upon
the
terrace
for
a
long
time
waiting
for
the
sun
to
set
so
as
to
witness
until
the
very
end
the
spectacle
of
the
black
and
battlemented
mount
drawn
in
outline
upon
a
horizon
of
flame
their
conversation
now
was
upon
ordinary
topics
such
as
might
be
discussed
in
presence
of
a
stranger
and
from
time
to
time
mme
de
burne
and
mariolle
glanced
at
each
other
then
they
all
returned
to
the
villa
which
stood
just
outside
avranches
in
a
fine
garden
overlooking
the
bay
wishing
to
be
prudent
and
a
little
disturbed
moreover
by
de
pradon
cold
and
almost
hostile
attitude
toward
him
mariolle
withdrew
at
an
early
hour
when
he
took
mme
de
burne
hand
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
she
said
to
him
twice
in
succession
with
a
peculiar
accent
till
till
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
and
mme
valsaci
who
had
long
since
habituated
themselves
to
country
ways
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
bed
go
said
mme
de
burne
i
am
going
to
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
so
am
i
her
father
added
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
shawl
and
went
out
and
they
began
to
walk
side
by
side
upon
the
alleys
which
the
full
moon
streaming
over
lawn
and
shrubbery
illuminated
as
if
they
had
been
little
winding
rivers
of
silver
after
a
silence
that
had
lasted
for
quite
a
while
de
pradon
said
in
a
low
voice
my
dear
child
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
i
have
never
troubled
you
with
my
counsels
she
felt
what
was
coming
and
was
prepared
to
meet
his
attack
pardon
me
papa
she
said
but
you
did
give
me
one
at
least
i
did
yes
yes
a
counsel
relating
to
your
way
of
life
yes
and
a
very
bad
one
it
was
too
and
so
if
you
give
me
any
more
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
follow
them
what
was
the
advice
that
i
gave
you
you
advised
me
to
marry
de
burne
that
goes
to
show
that
you
are
lacking
in
judgment
in
clearness
of
insight
in
acquaintance
with
mankind
in
general
and
with
your
daughter
in
particular
yes
i
made
a
mistake
on
that
occasion
but
i
am
sure
that
i
am
right
in
the
very
paternal
advice
that
i
feel
called
upon
to
give
you
at
the
present
juncture
let
me
hear
what
it
is
i
will
accept
as
much
of
it
as
the
circumstances
call
for
you
are
on
the
point
of
entangling
yourself
she
laughed
with
a
laugh
that
was
rather
too
hearty
and
completing
the
expression
of
his
idea
said
with
mariolle
doubtless
with
m
mariolle
you
forget
she
rejoined
the
entanglements
that
i
have
already
had
with
de
maltry
with
massival
with
gaston
de
lamarthe
and
a
dozen
others
of
all
of
whom
you
have
been
jealous
for
i
never
fall
in
with
a
man
who
is
nice
and
willing
to
show
a
little
devotion
for
me
but
all
my
flock
flies
into
a
rage
and
you
first
of
all
you
whom
nature
has
assigned
to
me
as
my
noble
father
and
general
manager
no
no
that
is
not
it
he
replied
with
warmth
you
have
never
compromised
your
liberty
with
anyone
on
the
contrary
you
show
a
great
deal
of
tact
in
your
relations
with
your
friends
my
dear
papa
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
i
promise
you
not
to
involve
myself
with
mariolle
any
more
than
i
have
done
with
the
rest
of
them
you
need
have
no
fears
i
admit
however
that
it
was
at
my
invitation
that
he
came
here
i
think
that
he
is
delightful
just
as
intelligent
as
his
predecessors
and
less
egotistical
and
you
thought
so
too
up
to
the
time
when
you
imagined
that
you
had
discovered
that
i
was
showing
some
small
preference
for
him
oh
you
are
not
so
sharp
as
you
think
you
are
i
know
you
and
i
could
say
a
great
deal
more
on
this
head
if
i
chose
as
mariolle
was
agreeable
to
me
then
i
thought
it
would
be
very
nice
to
make
a
pleasant
excursion
in
his
company
quite
by
chance
of
course
it
is
a
piece
of
stupidity
to
deprive
ourselves
of
everything
that
can
amuse
us
when
there
is
no
danger
attending
it
and
i
incur
no
danger
of
involving
myself
since
you
are
here
she
laughed
openly
as
she
finished
knowing
well
that
every
one
of
her
words
had
told
that
she
had
tied
his
tongue
by
the
adroit
imputation
of
a
jealousy
of
mariolle
that
she
had
suspected
that
she
had
instinctively
scented
in
him
for
a
long
time
past
and
she
rejoiced
over
this
discovery
with
a
secret
audacious
unutterable
coquetry
he
maintained
an
embarrassed
and
irritated
silence
feeling
that
she
had
divined
some
inexplicable
spite
underlying
his
paternal
solicitude
the
origin
of
which
he
himself
did
not
care
to
investigate
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
she
added
it
is
quite
natural
to
make
an
excursion
to
mont
at
this
time
of
the
year
in
company
with
you
my
father
my
uncle
and
aunt
and
a
friend
besides
no
one
will
know
it
and
even
if
they
do
what
can
they
say
against
it
when
we
are
back
in
paris
i
will
reduce
this
friend
to
the
ranks
again
to
keep
company
with
the
others
very
well
he
replied
let
it
be
as
if
i
had
said
nothing
they
took
a
few
steps
more
then
de
pradon
asked
shall
we
return
to
the
house
i
am
tired
i
am
going
to
bed
no
the
night
is
so
fine
i
am
going
to
walk
awhile
yet
he
murmured
meaningly
do
not
go
far
away
one
never
knows
what
people
may
be
around
oh
i
will
be
right
here
under
the
windows
good
night
then
my
dear
child
he
gave
her
a
hasty
kiss
upon
the
forehead
and
went
in
she
took
a
seat
a
little
way
off
upon
a
rustic
bench
that
was
set
in
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
a
great
oak
the
night
was
warm
filled
with
odors
from
the
fields
and
exhalations
from
the
sea
and
misty
light
for
beneath
the
full
moon
shining
brightly
in
the
cloudless
sky
a
fog
had
come
up
and
covered
the
waters
of
the
bay
onward
it
slowly
crept
like
white
hiding
from
sight
the
beach
that
would
soon
be
covered
by
the
incoming
tide
michèle
de
burne
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
and
her
dreamy
eyes
gazing
into
space
sought
to
look
into
her
heart
through
a
mist
that
was
as
impenetrable
and
pale
as
that
which
lay
upon
the
sands
how
many
times
before
this
seated
before
her
mirror
in
her
at
paris
had
she
questioned
herself
what
do
i
love
what
do
i
desire
what
do
i
hope
for
what
am
i
apart
from
the
pleasure
of
being
beautiful
and
the
imperious
necessity
which
she
felt
of
pleasing
which
really
afforded
her
much
delight
she
had
never
been
conscious
of
any
appeal
to
her
heart
beyond
some
passing
fancy
that
she
had
quickly
put
her
foot
upon
she
was
not
ignorant
of
herself
for
she
had
devoted
too
much
of
her
time
and
attention
to
watching
and
studying
her
face
and
all
her
person
not
to
have
been
observant
of
her
feelings
as
well
up
to
the
present
time
she
had
contented
herself
with
a
vague
interest
in
that
which
is
the
subject
of
emotion
in
others
but
was
powerless
to
impassion
her
or
capable
at
best
of
affording
her
a
momentary
distraction
and
yet
whenever
she
had
felt
a
little
warmer
liking
for
anyone
arising
within
her
whenever
a
rival
had
tried
to
take
away
from
her
a
man
whom
she
valued
and
by
arousing
her
feminine
instincts
had
caused
an
innocuous
fever
of
attachment
to
simmer
gently
in
her
veins
she
had
discovered
that
these
false
starts
of
love
had
caused
her
an
emotion
that
was
much
deeper
than
the
mere
gratification
of
success
but
it
never
lasted
why
perhaps
because
she
was
too
because
she
allowed
herself
to
become
wearied
disgusted
everything
that
at
first
had
pleased
her
in
a
man
everything
that
had
animated
moved
and
attracted
her
soon
appeared
in
her
eyes
commonplace
and
divested
of
its
charm
they
all
resembled
one
another
too
closely
without
ever
being
exactly
similar
and
none
of
them
had
yet
presented
himself
to
her
endowed
with
the
nature
and
the
merits
that
were
required
to
hold
her
liking
sufficiently
long
to
guide
her
heart
into
the
path
of
love
why
was
this
so
was
it
their
fault
or
was
it
hers
were
they
wanting
in
the
qualities
which
she
was
looking
for
or
was
it
she
who
was
deficient
in
the
attribute
that
makes
one
loved
is
love
the
result
of
meeting
with
a
person
whom
one
believes
to
have
been
created
expressly
for
himself
or
is
it
simply
the
result
of
having
been
born
with
the
faculty
of
loving
at
times
it
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
heart
must
be
provided
with
arms
like
the
body
loving
outstretching
arms
to
attract
embrace
and
enfold
and
that
her
heart
had
only
eyes
and
nothing
more
men
superior
men
were
often
known
to
become
madly
infatuated
with
women
who
were
unworthy
of
them
women
without
intelligence
without
character
often
without
beauty
why
was
this
wherein
lay
the
mystery
was
such
a
crisis
in
the
existence
of
two
beings
not
to
be
attributed
solely
to
a
providential
meeting
but
to
a
kind
of
seed
that
everyone
carries
about
within
him
and
that
puts
forth
its
buds
when
least
expected
she
had
been
intrusted
with
confidences
she
had
surprised
secrets
she
had
even
beheld
with
her
own
eyes
the
swift
transfiguration
that
results
from
the
breaking
forth
of
this
intoxication
of
the
feelings
and
she
had
reflected
deeply
upon
it
in
society
in
the
unintermitting
whirl
of
visiting
and
amusement
in
all
the
small
tomfooleries
of
fashionable
existence
by
which
the
wealthy
beguile
their
idle
hours
a
feeling
of
envious
jealous
and
almost
incredulous
astonishment
had
sometimes
been
excited
in
her
at
the
sight
of
men
and
women
in
whom
some
extraordinary
change
had
incontestably
taken
place
the
change
might
not
be
conspicuously
manifest
but
her
watchful
instinct
felt
it
and
divined
it
as
the
hound
holds
the
scent
of
his
game
their
faces
their
smiles
their
eyes
especially
would
betray
something
that
was
beyond
expression
in
words
an
ecstasy
a
delicious
serene
delight
a
joy
of
the
soul
made
manifest
in
the
body
illuming
look
and
flesh
without
being
able
to
account
for
it
she
was
displeased
with
them
for
this
lovers
had
always
been
disagreeable
objects
to
her
and
she
imagined
that
the
deep
and
secret
feeling
of
irritation
inspired
in
her
by
the
sight
of
people
whose
hearts
were
swayed
by
passion
was
simply
disdain
she
believed
that
she
could
recognize
them
with
a
readiness
and
an
accuracy
that
were
exceptional
and
it
was
a
fact
that
she
had
often
divined
and
unraveled
before
society
had
even
suspected
their
existence
when
she
reflected
upon
all
this
upon
the
fond
folly
that
may
be
induced
in
woman
by
the
contact
of
some
neighboring
existence
his
aspect
his
speech
his
thought
the
inexpressible
something
in
the
loved
being
that
robs
the
heart
of
tranquillity
she
decided
that
she
was
incapable
of
it
and
yet
weary
of
everything
oppressed
by
ineffable
yearnings
tormented
by
a
haunting
longing
after
change
and
some
unknown
state
feelings
which
were
perhaps
only
the
undeveloped
movements
of
an
undefined
groping
after
affection
how
often
had
she
desired
with
a
secret
shame
that
had
its
origin
in
her
pride
to
meet
with
a
man
who
for
a
time
were
it
only
for
a
few
months
might
by
his
sorceries
raise
her
to
an
abnormally
excited
condition
of
mind
and
body
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
must
assume
strange
and
attractive
forms
of
ecstasy
and
delight
during
these
emotional
periods
not
only
had
she
desired
such
an
encounter
but
she
had
even
sought
it
a
little
only
a
very
little
however
with
an
indolent
activity
that
never
devoted
itself
for
any
length
of
time
to
one
pursuit
in
all
her
inchoate
attachments
for
the
men
called
superior
who
had
dazzled
her
for
a
few
weeks
the
effervescence
of
her
heart
had
always
died
away
in
irremediable
disappointment
she
looked
for
too
much
from
their
dispositions
their
characters
their
delicacy
their
renown
their
merits
in
the
case
of
everyone
of
them
she
had
been
compelled
to
open
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
defects
of
great
men
are
often
more
prominent
than
their
merits
that
talent
is
a
special
gift
like
a
good
digestion
or
good
eyesight
an
isolated
gift
to
be
exercised
and
unconnected
with
the
aggregate
of
personal
charm
that
makes
one
relations
cordial
and
attractive
since
she
had
known
mariolle
however
she
was
otherwise
attached
to
him
but
did
she
love
him
did
she
love
him
with
the
love
of
woman
for
man
without
fame
or
prestige
he
had
conquered
her
affections
by
his
devotedness
his
tenderness
his
intelligence
by
all
the
real
and
unassuming
attractions
of
his
personality
he
had
conquered
for
he
was
constantly
present
in
her
thoughts
unremittingly
she
longed
for
his
society
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
one
more
agreeable
more
sympathetic
more
indispensable
to
her
could
this
be
love
she
was
not
conscious
of
carrying
in
her
soul
that
divine
flame
that
everyone
speaks
of
but
for
the
first
time
she
was
conscious
of
the
existence
there
of
a
sincere
wish
to
be
something
more
to
this
man
than
merely
a
charming
friend
did
she
love
him
does
love
demand
that
a
man
appear
endowed
with
exceptional
attractions
that
he
be
different
from
all
the
world
and
tower
above
it
in
the
aureole
that
the
heart
places
about
its
elect
or
does
it
suffice
that
he
find
favor
in
your
eyes
that
he
please
you
to
that
extent
that
you
scarce
know
how
to
do
without
him
in
the
latter
event
she
loved
him
or
at
any
rate
she
was
very
near
loving
him
after
having
pondered
deeply
on
the
matter
with
concentrated
attention
she
at
length
answered
herself
yes
i
love
him
but
i
am
lacking
in
warmth
that
is
the
defect
of
my
nature
still
she
had
felt
some
warmth
a
little
while
before
when
she
saw
him
coming
toward
her
upon
the
terrace
in
the
garden
of
avranches
for
the
first
time
she
had
felt
that
inexpressible
something
that
bears
us
impels
us
hurries
us
toward
some
one
she
had
experienced
great
pleasure
in
walking
at
his
side
in
having
him
near
her
burning
with
love
for
her
as
they
watched
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
shadow
of
mont
like
a
vision
in
a
legend
was
not
love
itself
a
kind
of
legend
of
the
soul
in
which
some
believe
through
instinct
and
in
which
others
sometimes
also
come
to
believe
through
stress
of
pondering
over
it
would
she
end
by
believing
in
it
she
had
felt
a
strange
desire
to
recline
her
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
this
man
to
be
nearer
to
him
to
seek
that
closer
union
that
is
never
found
to
give
him
what
one
offers
vainly
and
always
retains
the
close
intimacy
with
one
inner
self
yes
she
had
experienced
a
feeling
of
warmth
toward
him
and
she
still
felt
it
there
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
at
that
very
moment
perhaps
it
would
change
to
passion
should
she
give
way
to
it
she
opposed
too
much
resistance
to
men
powers
of
attraction
she
reasoned
on
them
combated
them
too
much
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
walk
with
him
on
an
evening
like
this
along
the
beneath
the
willows
and
allow
him
to
taste
her
lips
from
time
to
time
in
recompense
of
all
the
love
he
had
given
her
a
window
in
the
villa
was
flung
open
she
turned
her
head
it
was
her
father
who
was
doubtless
looking
to
see
if
she
were
there
she
called
to
him
you
are
not
asleep
yet
he
replied
if
you
do
come
in
you
will
take
cold
she
arose
thereupon
and
went
toward
the
house
when
she
was
in
her
room
she
raised
her
curtains
for
another
look
at
the
mist
over
the
bay
which
was
becoming
whiter
and
whiter
in
the
moonlight
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
vapors
in
her
heart
were
also
clearing
under
the
influence
of
her
dawning
tenderness
for
all
that
she
slept
soundly
and
her
maid
had
to
awake
her
in
the
morning
for
they
were
to
make
an
early
start
so
as
to
have
breakfast
at
the
mount
a
roomy
wagonette
drew
up
before
the
door
when
she
heard
the
rolling
of
the
wheels
upon
the
sand
she
went
to
her
window
and
looked
out
and
the
first
thing
that
her
eyes
encountered
was
the
face
of
andré
mariolle
who
was
looking
for
her
her
heart
began
to
beat
a
little
more
rapidly
she
was
astonished
and
dejected
as
she
reflected
upon
the
strange
and
novel
impression
produced
by
this
muscle
which
palpitates
and
hurries
the
blood
through
the
veins
merely
at
the
sight
of
some
one
again
she
asked
herself
as
she
had
done
the
previous
night
before
going
to
sleep
can
it
be
that
i
am
about
to
love
him
then
when
she
was
seated
face
to
face
with
him
her
instinct
told
her
how
deeply
he
was
smitten
how
he
was
suffering
with
his
love
and
she
felt
as
if
she
could
open
her
arms
to
him
and
put
up
her
mouth
they
only
exchanged
a
look
however
but
it
made
him
turn
pale
with
delight
the
carriage
rolled
away
it
was
a
bright
summer
morning
the
air
was
filled
with
the
melody
of
birds
and
everything
seemed
permeated
by
the
spirit
of
youth
they
descended
the
hill
crossed
the
river
and
drove
along
a
narrow
rough
stony
road
that
set
the
travelers
bumping
upon
their
seats
mme
de
burne
began
to
banter
her
uncle
upon
the
condition
of
this
road
that
was
enough
to
break
the
ice
and
the
brightness
that
pervaded
the
air
seemed
to
be
infused
into
the
spirit
of
them
all
as
they
emerged
from
a
little
hamlet
the
bay
suddenly
presented
itself
again
before
them
not
yellow
as
they
had
seen
it
the
evening
before
but
sparkling
with
clear
water
which
covered
everything
sands
and
as
the
coachman
said
even
the
very
road
itself
a
little
way
further
on
then
for
the
space
of
an
hour
they
allowed
the
horses
to
proceed
at
a
walk
so
as
to
give
this
inundation
time
to
return
to
the
deep
the
belts
of
elms
and
oaks
that
inclosed
the
farms
among
which
they
were
now
passing
momentarily
hid
from
their
vision
the
profile
of
the
abbey
standing
high
upon
its
rock
now
entirely
surrounded
by
the
sea
then
all
at
once
it
was
visible
again
between
two
farmyards
nearer
more
huge
more
astounding
than
ever
the
sun
cast
ruddy
tones
upon
the
old
crenelated
granite
church
perched
on
its
rocky
pedestal
michèle
de
burne
and
andré
mariolle
contemplated
it
both
mingling
with
the
newborn
or
acutely
sensitive
disturbances
of
their
hearts
the
poetry
of
the
vision
that
greeted
their
eyes
upon
this
rosy
july
morning
the
talk
went
on
with
easy
friendliness
mme
valsaci
told
tragic
tales
of
the
coast
nocturnal
dramas
of
the
yielding
sands
devouring
human
life
valsaci
took
up
arms
for
the
dike
so
much
abused
by
artists
and
extolled
it
for
the
uninterrupted
communication
that
it
afforded
with
the
mount
and
for
the
reclaimed
available
at
first
for
pasturage
and
afterward
for
cultivation
suddenly
the
wagonette
came
to
a
halt
the
sea
had
invaded
the
road
it
did
not
amount
to
much
only
a
film
of
water
upon
the
stony
way
but
they
knew
that
there
might
be
beneath
openings
from
which
they
might
never
emerge
so
they
had
to
wait
it
will
go
down
very
quickly
valsaci
declared
and
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
road
from
which
the
thin
sheet
of
water
was
already
receding
seemingly
absorbed
by
the
earth
or
drawn
away
to
some
distant
place
by
a
powerful
and
mysterious
force
they
got
down
from
the
carriage
for
a
nearer
look
at
this
strange
swift
silent
flight
of
the
sea
and
followed
it
step
by
step
now
spots
of
green
began
to
appear
among
the
submerged
vegetation
lightly
stirred
by
the
waves
here
and
there
and
these
spots
broadened
rounded
themselves
out
and
became
islands
quickly
these
islands
assumed
the
appearance
of
continents
separated
from
each
other
by
miniature
oceans
and
finally
over
the
whole
expanse
of
the
bay
it
was
a
headlong
flight
of
the
waters
retreating
to
their
distant
abode
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
long
silvery
veil
withdrawn
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
a
great
torn
slashed
veil
full
of
rents
which
left
exposed
the
wide
meadows
of
short
grass
as
it
was
pulled
aside
but
did
not
yet
disclose
the
yellow
sands
that
lay
beyond
they
had
climbed
into
the
carriage
again
and
everyone
was
standing
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
the
road
in
front
of
them
was
drying
and
the
horses
were
sent
forward
but
still
at
a
walk
and
as
the
rough
places
sometimes
caused
them
to
lose
their
equilibrium
andré
mariolle
suddenly
felt
michèle
de
burne
shoulder
resting
against
his
at
first
he
attributed
this
contact
to
the
movement
of
the
vehicle
but
she
did
not
stir
from
her
position
and
at
every
jolt
of
the
wheels
a
trembling
started
from
the
spot
where
she
had
placed
herself
and
shook
all
his
frame
and
laid
waste
his
heart
he
did
not
venture
to
look
at
the
young
woman
paralyzed
as
he
was
by
this
familiarity
and
with
a
confusion
in
his
brain
such
as
arises
from
drunkenness
he
said
to
himself
is
this
real
can
it
be
possible
can
it
be
that
we
are
both
losing
our
senses
the
horses
began
to
trot
and
they
had
to
resume
their
seats
then
mariolle
felt
some
sudden
mysterious
imperious
necessity
of
showing
himself
attentive
to
de
pradon
and
he
began
to
devote
himself
to
him
with
flattering
courtesy
almost
as
sensible
to
compliments
as
his
daughter
the
father
allowed
himself
to
be
won
over
and
soon
his
face
was
all
smiles
at
last
they
had
reached
the
causeway
and
were
advancing
rapidly
toward
the
mount
which
reared
its
head
among
the
sands
at
the
point
where
the
long
straight
road
ended
pontorson
river
washed
its
slope
while
to
the
right
the
pastures
covered
with
short
grass
which
the
coachman
wrongly
called
samphire
had
given
way
to
that
were
still
trickling
with
the
water
of
the
sea
the
lofty
monument
now
assumed
more
imposing
dimensions
upon
the
blue
heavens
against
which
very
clear
and
distinct
now
in
every
slightest
detail
its
summit
stood
out
in
bold
relief
with
all
its
towers
and
belfries
bristling
with
grimacing
gargoyles
heads
of
monstrous
beings
with
which
the
faith
and
the
terrors
of
our
ancestors
crowned
their
gothic
sanctuaries
it
was
nearly
one
when
they
reached
the
inn
where
breakfast
had
been
ordered
the
hostess
had
delayed
the
meal
for
prudential
reasons
it
was
not
ready
it
was
late
therefore
when
they
sat
down
at
table
and
everyone
was
very
hungry
soon
however
the
champagne
restored
their
spirits
everyone
was
in
good
humor
and
there
were
two
hearts
that
felt
that
they
were
on
the
verge
of
great
happiness
at
dessert
when
the
cheering
effect
of
the
wine
that
they
had
drunk
and
the
pleasures
of
conversation
had
developed
in
their
frames
the
feeling
of
and
contentment
that
sometimes
warms
us
after
a
good
meal
and
inclines
us
to
take
a
rosy
view
of
everything
mariolle
suggested
what
do
you
say
to
staying
over
here
until
it
would
be
so
nice
to
look
upon
this
scene
by
moonlight
and
so
pleasant
to
dine
here
together
this
evening
mme
de
burne
gave
her
assent
at
once
and
the
two
men
also
concurred
mme
valsaci
alone
hesitated
on
account
of
the
little
boy
that
she
had
left
at
home
but
her
husband
reassured
her
and
reminded
her
that
she
had
frequently
remained
away
before
he
at
once
sat
down
and
dispatched
a
telegram
to
the
governess
andré
mariolle
had
flattered
him
by
giving
his
approval
to
the
causeway
expressing
his
judgment
that
it
detracted
far
less
than
was
generally
reported
from
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
mount
thereby
making
himself
to
the
engineer
upon
rising
from
table
they
went
to
visit
the
monument
taking
the
road
of
the
ramparts
the
city
a
collection
of
old
houses
dating
back
to
the
middle
ages
and
rising
in
tiers
one
above
the
other
upon
the
enormous
mass
of
granite
that
is
crowned
by
the
abbey
is
separated
from
the
sands
by
a
lofty
crenelated
wall
this
wall
winds
about
the
city
in
its
ascent
with
many
a
twist
and
turn
with
abrupt
angles
and
elbows
and
platforms
and
watchtowers
all
forming
so
many
surprises
for
the
eye
which
at
every
turn
rests
upon
some
new
expanse
of
the
horizon
they
were
silent
for
whether
they
had
seen
this
marvelous
edifice
before
or
not
they
were
equally
impressed
by
it
and
the
substantial
breakfast
that
they
had
eaten
moreover
had
made
them
there
it
rose
above
them
in
the
sky
a
wondrous
tangle
of
granite
ornamentation
spires
belfries
arches
thrown
from
one
tower
to
another
a
huge
light
in
stone
embroidered
upon
the
azure
of
the
heavens
from
which
the
fantastic
and
array
of
gargoyles
seemed
to
be
preparing
to
detach
themselves
and
wing
their
flight
away
upon
the
northern
flank
of
the
mount
between
the
abbey
and
the
sea
a
wild
and
almost
perpendicular
descent
that
is
called
the
forest
because
it
is
covered
with
ancient
trees
began
where
the
houses
ended
and
formed
a
speck
of
dark
green
coloring
upon
the
limitless
expanse
of
yellow
sands
mme
de
burne
and
mariolle
who
headed
the
little
procession
stopped
to
enjoy
the
view
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
her
senses
steeped
in
a
rapture
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
with
light
steps
she
pursued
her
upward
way
willing
to
keep
on
climbing
forever
in
his
company
toward
this
fabric
of
a
vision
or
indeed
toward
any
other
end
she
would
have
been
glad
that
the
steep
way
should
never
have
an
ending
for
almost
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
knew
what
it
was
to
experience
a
plenitude
of
satisfaction
heavens
how
beautiful
it
is
she
murmured
looking
upon
her
he
answered
i
can
think
only
of
you
she
continued
with
a
smile
i
am
not
inclined
to
be
very
poetical
as
a
general
thing
but
this
seems
to
me
so
beautiful
that
i
am
really
moved
he
stammered
i
i
love
you
to
distraction
he
was
conscious
of
a
slight
pressure
of
her
arm
and
they
resumed
the
ascent
they
found
a
keeper
awaiting
them
at
the
door
of
the
abbey
and
they
entered
by
that
superb
staircase
between
two
massive
towers
which
leads
to
the
hall
of
the
guards
then
they
went
from
hall
to
hall
from
court
to
court
from
dungeon
to
dungeon
listening
wondering
charmed
with
everything
admiring
everything
the
crypt
with
its
huge
pillars
so
beautiful
in
their
massiveness
which
sustains
upon
its
sturdy
arches
all
the
weight
of
the
choir
of
the
church
above
and
all
of
the
an
edifice
of
three
stories
of
gothic
monuments
rising
one
above
the
other
the
most
extraordinary
masterpiece
of
the
monastic
and
military
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
then
they
came
to
the
cloisters
their
surprise
was
so
great
that
they
involuntarily
came
to
a
halt
at
sight
of
this
square
court
inclosing
the
lightest
most
graceful
most
charming
of
colonnades
to
be
seen
in
any
cloisters
in
the
world
for
the
entire
length
of
the
four
galleries
the
slender
shafts
in
double
rows
surmounted
by
exquisite
capitals
sustain
a
continuous
garland
of
flowers
and
gothic
ornamentation
of
infinite
variety
and
constantly
changing
design
the
elegant
and
unaffected
fancies
of
the
old
artists
who
thus
worked
out
their
dreams
in
stone
beneath
the
hammer
michèle
de
burne
and
andré
mariolle
walked
completely
around
the
inclosure
very
slowly
arm
in
arm
while
the
others
somewhat
fatigued
stood
near
the
door
and
admired
from
a
distance
heavens
what
pleasure
this
affords
me
she
said
coming
to
a
stop
for
my
part
i
neither
know
where
i
am
nor
what
my
eyes
behold
i
am
conscious
that
you
are
at
my
side
and
that
is
all
then
smiling
she
looked
him
in
the
face
and
murmured
andré
he
saw
that
she
was
yielding
no
further
word
was
spoken
and
they
resumed
their
walk
the
inspection
of
the
edifice
was
continued
but
they
hardly
had
eyes
to
see
anything
nevertheless
their
attention
was
attracted
for
the
space
of
a
moment
by
the
airy
bridge
seemingly
of
lace
inclosed
within
an
arch
thrown
across
space
between
two
belfries
as
if
to
afford
a
way
to
scale
the
clouds
and
their
amazement
was
still
greater
when
they
came
to
the
madman
path
a
dizzy
track
devoid
of
parapet
that
encircles
the
farthest
tower
nearly
at
its
summit
may
we
go
up
there
she
asked
it
is
forbidden
the
guide
replied
she
showed
him
a
piece
all
the
members
of
the
party
giddy
at
sight
of
the
yawning
gulf
and
the
immensity
of
surrounding
space
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
the
imprudent
freak
she
asked
mariolle
will
you
go
he
laughed
i
have
been
in
more
dangerous
places
than
that
and
paying
no
further
attention
to
the
others
they
set
out
he
went
first
along
the
narrow
cornice
that
overhung
the
gulf
and
she
followed
him
gliding
along
close
to
the
wall
with
eyes
downcast
that
she
might
not
see
the
yawning
void
beneath
terrified
now
and
almost
ready
to
sink
with
fear
clinging
to
the
hand
that
he
held
out
to
her
but
she
felt
that
he
was
strong
that
there
was
no
sign
of
weakening
there
that
he
was
sure
of
head
and
foot
and
enraptured
for
all
her
fears
she
said
to
herself
truly
this
is
a
man
they
were
alone
in
space
at
the
height
where
the
soar
they
were
contemplating
the
same
horizon
that
the
creatures
are
ceaselessly
scouring
in
their
flight
as
they
explore
it
with
their
little
yellow
eyes
mariolle
felt
that
she
was
trembling
he
asked
do
you
feel
dizzy
a
little
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
but
in
your
company
i
fear
nothing
at
this
he
drew
near
and
sustained
her
by
putting
his
arm
about
her
and
this
simple
assistance
inspired
her
with
such
courage
that
she
ventured
to
raise
her
head
and
take
a
look
at
the
distance
he
was
almost
carrying
her
and
she
offered
no
resistance
enjoying
the
protection
of
those
strong
arms
which
thus
enabled
her
to
traverse
the
heavens
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
with
a
romantic
womanly
gratitude
that
he
did
not
mar
their
flight
by
kisses
when
they
had
rejoined
the
others
of
the
party
who
were
awaiting
them
with
the
greatest
anxiety
de
pradon
angrily
said
to
his
daughter
what
a
silly
thing
to
do
she
replied
with
conviction
no
it
was
not
papa
since
it
was
successfully
accomplished
nothing
that
succeeds
is
ever
stupid
he
merely
gave
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
they
descended
the
stairs
at
the
porter
lodge
there
was
another
stoppage
to
purchase
photographs
and
when
they
reached
the
inn
it
was
nearly
the
hostess
recommended
a
short
walk
upon
the
sands
so
as
to
obtain
a
view
of
the
mount
toward
the
open
sea
in
which
direction
she
said
it
presented
its
most
imposing
aspect
although
they
were
all
much
fatigued
the
band
started
out
again
and
made
the
tour
of
the
ramparts
picking
their
way
among
the
treacherous
downs
solid
to
the
eye
but
yielding
to
the
step
where
the
foot
that
was
placed
upon
the
pretty
yellow
carpet
that
was
stretched
beneath
it
and
seemed
solid
would
suddenly
sink
up
to
the
calf
in
the
deceitful
golden
ooze
seen
from
this
point
the
abbey
all
at
once
losing
the
appearance
with
which
it
astounded
the
beholder
on
the
mainland
assumed
as
if
in
menace
of
old
ocean
the
martial
appearance
of
a
feudal
manor
with
its
huge
battlemented
wall
picturesquely
pierced
with
and
supported
by
gigantic
buttresses
that
sank
their
cyclopean
stone
foundations
in
the
bosom
of
the
fantastic
mountain
mme
de
burne
and
andré
mariolle
however
were
not
heedless
of
all
that
they
were
thinking
only
of
themselves
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
net
that
they
had
set
for
each
other
shut
up
within
the
walls
of
that
prison
to
which
no
sound
comes
from
the
outer
world
where
the
eye
beholds
only
one
being
when
they
found
themselves
again
seated
before
their
plates
however
beneath
the
cheerful
light
of
the
lamps
they
seemed
to
awake
and
discovered
that
they
were
hungry
just
like
other
mortals
they
remained
a
long
time
at
table
and
when
the
dinner
was
ended
the
moonlight
was
quite
forgotten
in
the
pleasure
of
conversation
there
was
no
one
moreover
who
had
any
desire
to
go
out
and
no
one
suggested
it
the
broad
moon
might
shed
her
waves
of
poetic
light
down
upon
the
little
thin
sheet
of
rising
tide
that
was
already
creeping
up
the
sands
with
the
noise
of
a
trickling
stream
scarcely
perceptible
to
the
ear
but
sinister
and
alarming
she
might
light
up
the
ramparts
that
crept
in
spirals
up
the
flanks
of
the
mount
and
illumine
the
romantic
shadows
of
all
the
belfries
of
the
old
abbey
standing
in
its
wondrous
setting
of
a
boundless
bay
in
the
bosom
of
which
were
quiveringly
reflected
the
lights
that
crawled
along
the
downs
no
one
cared
to
see
more
it
was
not
yet
ten
when
mme
valsaci
overcome
with
sleep
spoke
of
going
to
bed
and
her
proposition
was
received
without
a
dissenting
voice
bidding
one
another
a
cordial
good
night
each
withdrew
to
his
chamber
andré
mariolle
knew
well
that
he
would
not
sleep
he
therefore
lighted
his
two
candles
and
placed
them
on
the
mantelpiece
threw
open
his
window
and
looked
out
into
the
night
all
the
strength
of
his
body
was
giving
way
beneath
the
torture
of
an
unavailing
hope
he
knew
that
she
was
there
close
at
hand
that
there
were
only
two
doors
between
them
and
yet
it
was
almost
as
impossible
to
go
to
her
as
it
would
be
to
dam
the
tide
that
was
coming
in
and
submerging
all
the
land
there
was
a
cry
in
his
throat
that
strove
to
liberate
itself
and
in
his
nerves
such
an
unquenchable
and
futile
torment
of
expectation
that
he
asked
himself
what
he
was
to
do
unable
as
he
was
longer
to
endure
the
solitude
of
this
evening
of
sterile
happiness
gradually
all
the
sounds
had
died
away
in
the
inn
and
in
the
single
little
winding
street
of
the
town
mariolle
still
remained
leaning
upon
his
conscious
only
that
time
was
passing
contemplating
the
silvery
sheet
of
the
still
rising
tide
and
rejecting
the
idea
of
going
to
bed
as
if
he
had
felt
the
undefined
presentiment
of
some
approaching
providential
good
fortune
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
hand
was
fumbling
with
the
fastening
of
his
door
he
turned
with
a
start
the
door
slowly
opened
and
a
woman
entered
the
room
her
head
veiled
in
a
cloud
of
white
lace
and
her
form
enveloped
in
one
of
those
great
that
seem
made
of
silk
cashmere
and
snow
she
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
her
then
as
if
she
had
not
seen
him
where
he
stood
motionless
as
if
smitten
with
joy
in
the
bright
square
of
moonlight
of
the
window
she
went
straight
to
the
mantelpiece
and
blew
out
the
two
candles
chapter
conspiracy
they
were
to
meet
next
morning
in
front
of
the
inn
to
say
to
one
another
andré
the
first
one
down
awaited
her
coming
with
a
poignant
feeling
of
mixed
uneasiness
and
delight
what
would
she
do
what
would
she
be
to
him
what
would
become
of
her
and
of
him
in
what
or
terrible
adventure
had
he
engaged
himself
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
make
of
him
what
she
would
a
visionary
like
an
or
a
martyr
at
her
will
he
paced
to
and
fro
beside
the
two
carriages
for
they
were
to
separate
he
to
continue
the
deception
ending
his
trip
by
way
of
saint
malo
they
returning
to
avranches
when
would
he
see
her
again
would
she
cut
short
her
visit
to
her
family
or
would
she
delay
her
return
he
was
horribly
afraid
of
what
she
would
first
say
to
him
how
she
would
first
look
at
him
for
he
had
not
seen
her
and
they
had
scarcely
spoken
during
their
brief
interview
of
the
night
before
there
remained
to
mariolle
from
that
strange
fleeting
interview
the
faint
feeling
of
disappointment
of
the
man
who
has
been
unable
to
reap
all
that
harvest
of
love
which
he
thought
was
ready
for
the
sickle
and
at
the
same
time
the
intoxication
of
triumph
and
resulting
from
that
the
almost
assured
hope
of
finally
making
himself
complete
master
of
her
affections
he
heard
her
voice
and
started
she
was
talking
loudly
evidently
irritated
at
some
wish
that
her
father
had
expressed
and
when
he
beheld
her
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
there
was
a
little
angry
curl
upon
her
lips
that
bespoke
her
impatience
mariolle
took
a
couple
of
steps
toward
her
she
saw
him
and
smiled
her
eyes
suddenly
recovered
their
serenity
and
assumed
an
expression
of
kindliness
which
diffused
itself
over
the
other
features
and
she
quickly
and
cordially
extended
to
him
her
hand
as
if
in
ratification
of
their
new
relations
so
then
we
are
to
separate
she
said
to
him
alas
madame
the
thought
makes
me
suffer
more
than
i
can
tell
it
will
not
be
for
long
she
murmured
she
saw
de
pradon
coming
toward
them
and
added
in
a
whisper
say
that
you
are
going
to
take
a
ten
days
trip
through
brittany
but
do
not
take
it
mme
de
valsaci
came
running
up
in
great
excitement
what
is
this
that
your
father
has
been
telling
me
that
you
are
going
to
leave
us
day
after
you
were
to
stay
until
next
monday
at
least
mme
de
burne
replied
with
a
suspicion
of
ill
humor
papa
is
nothing
but
a
bungler
who
never
knows
enough
to
hold
his
tongue
the
has
given
me
as
it
does
every
year
a
very
unpleasant
neuralgia
and
i
did
say
something
or
other
about
going
away
so
as
not
to
have
to
be
ill
for
a
month
but
this
is
no
time
for
bothering
over
that
mariolle
coachman
urged
him
to
get
into
the
carriage
and
be
off
so
that
they
might
not
miss
the
pontorson
train
mme
de
burne
asked
and
you
when
do
you
expect
to
be
back
in
paris
he
assumed
an
air
of
hesitancy
well
i
ca
say
exactly
i
want
to
see
saint
malo
brest
douarnenez
the
bay
des
trépassés
cape
raz
audierne
penmarch
morbihan
all
this
celebrated
portion
of
the
breton
country
in
a
word
that
will
take
me
say
after
a
silence
devoted
to
feigned
calculation
he
exceeded
her
estimate
fifteen
or
twenty
days
that
will
be
quite
a
trip
she
laughingly
said
for
my
part
if
my
nerves
trouble
me
as
they
did
last
night
i
shall
be
at
home
before
i
am
two
days
older
his
emotion
was
so
great
that
he
felt
like
exclaiming
thanks
he
contented
himself
with
kissing
with
a
lover
kiss
the
hand
that
she
extended
to
him
for
the
last
time
and
after
a
profuse
exchange
of
thanks
and
compliments
with
the
valsacis
and
de
pradon
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
reassured
by
the
announcement
of
his
projected
trip
he
climbed
into
his
vehicle
and
drove
off
turning
his
head
for
a
parting
look
at
her
he
made
no
stop
on
his
journey
back
to
paris
and
was
conscious
of
seeing
nothing
on
the
way
all
night
long
he
lay
back
in
the
corner
of
his
compartment
with
eyes
half
closed
and
folded
arms
his
mind
reverting
to
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
hours
and
all
his
thoughts
concentrated
upon
the
realization
of
his
dream
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
his
own
abode
upon
the
cessation
of
the
noise
and
bustle
of
travel
in
the
silence
of
the
library
where
he
generally
passed
his
time
where
he
worked
and
wrote
and
where
he
almost
always
felt
himself
possessed
by
a
restful
tranquillity
in
the
friendly
companionship
of
his
books
his
piano
and
his
violin
there
now
commenced
in
him
that
unending
torment
of
impatient
waiting
which
devours
as
with
a
fever
insatiable
hearts
like
his
he
was
surprised
that
he
could
apply
himself
to
nothing
that
nothing
served
to
occupy
his
mind
that
reading
and
music
the
occupations
that
he
generally
employed
to
while
away
the
idle
moments
of
his
life
were
unavailing
not
only
to
afford
distraction
to
his
thoughts
but
even
to
give
rest
and
quiet
to
his
physical
being
and
he
asked
himself
what
he
was
to
do
to
appease
this
new
disturbance
an
inexplicable
physical
need
of
motion
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
him
of
going
forth
and
walking
the
streets
of
constant
movement
the
crisis
of
that
agitation
that
is
imparted
by
the
mind
to
the
body
and
which
is
nothing
more
than
an
instinctive
and
unappeasable
longing
to
seek
and
find
some
other
being
he
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
as
he
was
descending
the
stairs
he
asked
himself
in
which
direction
shall
i
go
thereupon
an
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
he
must
procure
a
pretty
and
secluded
retreat
to
serve
them
as
a
trysting
place
he
pursued
his
investigations
in
every
quarter
ransacking
streets
avenues
and
boulevards
distrustfully
examining
with
their
servile
smiles
keepers
of
suspicious
appearance
and
apartments
with
doubtful
furnishings
and
at
evening
he
returned
to
his
house
in
a
state
of
discouragement
at
nine
the
next
day
he
started
out
again
and
at
nightfall
he
finally
succeeded
in
discovering
at
auteuil
buried
in
a
garden
that
had
three
exits
a
lonely
pavilion
which
an
upholsterer
in
the
neighborhood
promised
to
render
habitable
in
two
days
he
ordered
what
was
necessary
selecting
very
plain
furniture
of
varnished
pine
and
thick
carpets
a
baker
who
lived
near
one
of
the
garden
gates
had
charge
of
the
property
and
an
arrangement
was
completed
with
his
wife
whereby
she
was
to
care
for
the
rooms
while
a
gardener
of
the
quarter
also
took
a
contract
for
filling
the
beds
with
flowers
all
these
arrangements
kept
him
busy
until
it
was
eight
and
when
at
last
he
got
home
worn
out
with
fatigue
he
beheld
with
a
beating
heart
a
telegram
lying
on
his
desk
he
opened
it
and
read
i
will
be
home
await
instructions
miche
he
had
not
written
to
her
yet
fearing
that
as
she
was
soon
to
leave
avranches
his
letter
might
go
astray
and
as
soon
as
he
had
dined
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
to
lay
before
her
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
the
task
was
a
long
and
difficult
one
for
all
the
words
and
phrases
that
he
could
muster
and
even
his
ideas
seemed
to
him
weak
mediocre
and
ridiculous
vehicles
in
which
to
convey
to
her
the
delicacy
and
passionateness
of
his
thanks
the
letter
that
he
received
from
her
upon
waking
next
morning
confirmed
the
statement
that
she
would
reach
home
that
evening
and
begged
him
not
to
make
his
presence
known
to
anyone
for
a
few
days
in
order
that
full
belief
might
be
accorded
to
the
report
that
he
was
traveling
she
also
requested
him
to
walk
upon
the
terrace
of
the
tuileries
garden
that
overlooks
the
seine
the
following
day
at
ten
he
was
there
an
hour
before
the
time
appointed
and
to
kill
time
wandered
about
in
the
immense
garden
that
was
peopled
only
by
a
few
early
pedestrians
belated
officeholders
on
their
way
to
the
public
buildings
on
the
left
bank
clerks
and
toilers
of
every
condition
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
watch
the
hurrying
crowds
driven
by
the
necessity
of
earning
their
daily
bread
to
brutalizing
labors
and
to
compare
his
lot
with
theirs
on
this
spot
at
the
minute
when
he
was
awaiting
his
mistress
a
queen
among
the
queens
of
the
earth
he
felt
himself
so
fortunate
a
being
so
privileged
raised
to
such
a
height
beyond
their
petty
struggles
that
he
felt
like
giving
thanks
to
the
blue
sky
for
to
him
providence
was
but
a
series
of
alternations
of
sunshine
and
of
rain
due
to
chance
mysterious
ruler
over
weather
and
over
men
when
it
wanted
a
few
minutes
of
ten
he
ascended
to
the
terrace
and
watched
for
her
coming
she
will
be
late
he
thought
he
had
scarcely
more
than
heard
the
clock
in
an
adjacent
building
strike
ten
when
he
thought
he
saw
her
at
a
distance
coming
through
the
garden
with
hurrying
steps
like
a
in
haste
to
reach
her
shop
can
it
indeed
be
she
he
recognized
her
step
but
was
astonished
by
her
changed
appearance
so
unassuming
in
a
neat
little
toilette
of
dark
colors
she
was
coming
toward
the
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
terrace
however
in
a
as
if
she
had
traveled
that
road
many
times
before
ah
he
said
to
himself
she
must
be
fond
of
this
place
and
come
to
walk
here
sometimes
he
watched
her
as
she
raised
her
dress
to
put
her
foot
on
the
first
step
and
then
nimbly
flew
up
the
remaining
ones
and
as
he
eagerly
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
she
said
to
him
as
he
came
near
with
a
pleasant
smile
in
which
there
was
a
trace
of
uneasiness
you
are
very
imprudent
you
must
not
show
yourself
like
that
i
saw
you
almost
from
the
rue
de
rivoli
come
we
will
go
and
take
a
seat
on
a
bench
yonder
there
is
where
you
must
wait
for
me
next
time
he
could
not
help
asking
her
so
you
come
here
often
yes
i
have
a
great
liking
for
this
place
and
as
i
am
an
early
walker
i
come
here
for
exercise
and
to
look
at
the
scenery
which
is
very
pretty
and
then
one
never
meets
anybody
here
while
the
bois
is
out
of
the
question
on
just
that
account
but
you
must
be
careful
not
to
give
away
my
secret
he
laughed
i
shall
not
be
very
likely
to
do
that
discreetly
taking
her
hand
a
little
hand
that
was
hanging
at
her
side
conveniently
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
he
sighed
how
i
love
you
my
heart
was
sick
with
waiting
for
you
did
you
receive
my
letter
yes
i
thank
you
for
it
it
was
very
touching
then
you
have
not
become
angry
with
me
yet
why
no
why
should
i
you
are
just
as
nice
as
you
can
be
he
sought
for
ardent
words
words
that
would
vibrate
with
his
emotion
and
his
gratitude
as
none
came
to
him
and
as
he
was
too
deeply
moved
to
permit
of
the
free
expression
of
the
thought
that
was
within
him
he
simply
said
again
how
i
love
you
she
said
to
him
i
brought
you
here
because
there
are
water
and
boats
in
this
place
as
well
as
down
yonder
it
is
not
at
all
like
what
we
saw
down
there
still
it
is
not
disagreeable
they
were
sitting
on
a
bench
near
the
stone
balustrade
that
runs
along
the
river
almost
alone
invisible
from
every
quarter
the
only
living
beings
to
be
seen
on
the
long
terrace
at
that
hour
were
two
gardeners
and
three
nursemaids
carriages
were
rolling
along
the
quay
at
their
feet
but
they
could
not
see
them
footsteps
were
resounding
upon
the
adjacent
sidewalk
over
against
the
wall
that
sustained
the
promenade
and
still
unable
to
find
words
in
which
to
express
their
thoughts
they
let
their
gaze
wander
over
the
beautiful
parisian
landscape
that
stretches
from
the
île
and
the
towers
of
to
the
heights
of
meudon
she
repeated
her
thought
none
the
less
it
is
very
pretty
is
it
but
he
was
suddenly
seized
by
the
thrilling
remembrance
of
their
journey
through
space
up
on
the
summit
of
the
abbey
tower
and
with
a
regretful
feeling
for
the
emotion
that
was
past
and
gone
he
said
oh
madame
do
you
remember
our
escapade
of
the
path
yes
but
i
am
a
little
afraid
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
when
it
is
all
over
how
my
head
would
spin
around
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
i
was
just
drunk
with
the
fresh
air
the
sunlight
and
the
sea
look
my
friend
what
a
magnificent
view
we
have
before
us
how
i
do
love
paris
he
was
surprised
having
a
confused
feeling
of
missing
something
that
had
appeared
in
her
down
there
in
the
country
he
murmured
it
matters
not
to
me
where
i
am
so
that
i
am
only
near
you
her
only
answer
was
a
pressure
of
the
hand
inspired
with
greater
happiness
perhaps
by
this
little
signal
than
he
would
have
been
by
a
tender
word
his
heart
relieved
of
the
care
that
had
oppressed
it
until
now
he
could
at
last
find
words
to
express
his
feelings
he
told
her
slowly
in
words
that
were
almost
solemn
that
he
had
given
her
his
life
forever
that
she
might
do
with
it
what
she
would
she
was
grateful
but
like
the
child
of
modern
scepticism
that
she
was
and
willing
captive
of
her
iconoclastic
irony
she
smiled
as
she
replied
i
would
not
make
such
a
long
engagement
as
that
if
i
were
you
he
turned
and
faced
her
and
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
with
that
penetrating
look
which
is
like
a
touch
repeated
what
he
had
just
said
at
greater
length
in
a
more
ardent
more
poetical
form
of
expression
all
that
he
had
written
in
so
many
burning
letters
he
now
expressed
with
such
a
fervor
of
conviction
that
it
seemed
to
her
as
she
listened
that
she
was
sitting
in
a
cloud
of
incense
she
felt
herself
caressed
in
every
fiber
of
her
feminine
nature
by
his
adoring
words
more
deeply
than
ever
before
when
he
had
ended
she
simply
said
and
i
too
love
you
dearly
they
were
still
holding
each
other
hand
like
young
folks
walking
along
a
country
road
and
watching
with
vague
eyes
the
little
steamboats
plying
on
the
river
they
were
alone
by
themselves
in
paris
in
the
great
confused
uproar
whether
remote
or
near
at
hand
that
surrounded
them
in
this
city
full
of
all
the
life
of
all
the
world
more
alone
than
they
had
been
on
the
summit
of
their
aerial
tower
and
for
some
seconds
they
were
quite
oblivious
that
there
existed
on
earth
any
other
beings
but
their
two
selves
she
was
the
first
to
recover
the
sensation
of
reality
and
of
the
flight
of
time
shall
we
see
each
other
again
she
said
he
reflected
for
an
instant
and
abashed
by
what
he
had
in
mind
to
ask
of
her
yes
yes
certainly
he
replied
but
shall
we
never
meet
in
any
other
place
this
place
is
unfrequented
still
people
may
come
here
she
hesitated
you
are
right
still
it
is
necessary
also
that
you
should
not
show
yourself
for
at
least
two
weeks
yet
so
that
people
may
think
that
you
are
away
traveling
it
will
be
very
nice
and
mysterious
for
us
to
meet
and
no
one
know
that
you
are
in
paris
meanwhile
however
i
can
not
receive
you
at
my
house
so
i
do
see
he
felt
that
he
was
blushing
and
continued
neither
can
i
ask
you
to
come
to
my
house
is
there
nothing
else
is
there
no
other
place
being
a
woman
of
practical
sense
logical
and
without
false
modesty
she
was
neither
surprised
nor
shocked
why
yes
she
said
only
we
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
i
have
thought
it
over
what
so
soon
yes
madame
well
are
you
acquainted
with
the
rue
des
at
auteuil
no
it
runs
into
the
rue
tournemine
and
the
rue
well
in
this
street
or
rather
lane
there
is
a
garden
and
in
this
garden
a
pavilion
that
also
communicates
with
the
two
streets
that
i
mentioned
what
next
that
pavilion
awaits
you
she
reflected
still
with
no
appearance
of
embarrassment
and
then
asked
two
or
three
questions
that
were
dictated
by
feminine
prudence
his
explanations
seemed
to
be
satisfactory
for
she
murmured
as
she
arose
well
i
will
go
at
what
time
three
seven
is
the
number
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
behind
the
door
do
not
forget
give
a
knock
as
you
pass
yes
my
friend
adieu
till
till
adieu
thanks
i
adore
you
they
had
risen
to
their
feet
do
not
come
with
me
she
said
stay
here
for
ten
minutes
and
when
you
leave
go
by
the
way
of
the
quay
adieu
adieu
she
started
off
very
rapidly
with
such
a
modest
unassuming
air
so
hurriedly
that
actually
she
might
have
been
mistaken
for
one
of
pretty
who
trot
along
the
streets
in
the
morning
on
the
way
to
their
honest
labors
he
took
a
cab
to
auteuil
tormented
by
the
fear
that
the
house
might
not
be
ready
against
the
following
day
he
found
it
full
of
workmen
however
the
hangings
were
all
in
place
upon
the
walls
the
carpets
laid
upon
the
floors
everywhere
there
was
a
sound
of
pounding
hammering
beating
washing
in
the
garden
which
was
quite
large
and
rather
pretty
the
remains
of
an
ancient
park
containing
a
few
large
old
trees
a
thick
clump
of
shrubbery
that
stood
for
a
forest
two
green
tables
two
and
paths
twisting
about
among
the
beds
the
gardener
of
the
vicinity
had
set
out
geraniums
pinks
reseda
and
twenty
other
species
of
those
plants
the
growth
of
which
is
advanced
or
retarded
by
careful
attention
so
that
a
naked
field
may
be
transformed
in
a
day
into
a
blooming
flower
garden
mariolle
was
as
delighted
as
if
he
had
scored
another
success
with
his
michèle
and
having
exacted
an
oath
from
the
upholsterer
that
all
the
furniture
should
be
in
place
the
next
day
before
noon
he
went
off
to
various
shops
to
buy
some
and
pictures
for
the
adornment
of
the
interior
of
this
retreat
for
the
walls
he
selected
some
of
those
admirable
photographs
of
celebrated
pictures
that
are
produced
nowadays
for
the
tables
and
mantelshelves
some
rare
pottery
and
a
few
of
those
familiar
objects
that
women
always
like
to
have
about
them
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
expended
the
income
of
three
months
and
he
did
it
with
great
pleasure
reflecting
that
for
the
last
ten
years
he
had
been
living
very
economically
not
from
penuriousness
but
because
of
the
absence
of
expensive
tastes
and
this
circumstance
now
allowed
him
to
do
things
somewhat
magnificently
he
returned
to
the
pavilion
early
in
the
morning
of
the
following
day
presided
over
the
arrival
and
placing
of
the
furniture
climbed
ladders
and
hung
the
pictures
burned
perfumes
and
vaporized
them
upon
the
hangings
and
poured
them
over
the
carpets
in
his
feverish
joy
in
the
excited
rapture
of
all
his
being
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
engaged
in
such
an
engrossing
such
a
delightful
labor
at
every
moment
he
looked
to
see
what
time
it
was
and
calculated
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
would
be
there
he
urged
on
the
workmen
and
stimulated
his
invention
so
to
arrange
the
different
objects
that
they
might
be
displayed
in
their
best
light
in
his
prudence
he
dismissed
everyone
before
it
was
two
and
then
as
the
of
the
clock
tardily
made
its
last
revolution
around
the
dial
in
the
silence
of
that
house
where
he
was
awaiting
the
greatest
happiness
that
ever
he
could
have
wished
for
alone
with
his
reverie
going
and
coming
from
room
to
room
he
passed
the
minutes
until
she
should
be
there
finally
he
went
out
into
the
garden
the
sunlight
was
streaming
through
the
foliage
upon
the
grass
and
falling
with
especially
charming
brilliancy
upon
a
bed
of
roses
the
very
heavens
were
contributing
their
aid
to
embellish
this
then
he
went
and
stood
by
the
gate
partially
opening
it
to
look
out
from
time
to
time
for
fear
she
might
mistake
the
house
three
rang
out
from
some
belfry
and
forthwith
the
sounds
were
echoed
from
a
dozen
schools
and
factories
he
stood
waiting
now
with
watch
in
hand
and
gave
a
start
of
surprise
when
two
little
light
knocks
were
given
against
the
door
to
which
his
ear
was
closely
applied
for
he
had
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
street
he
opened
it
was
she
she
looked
about
her
with
astonishment
first
of
all
she
examined
with
a
distrustful
glance
the
neighboring
houses
but
her
inspection
reassured
her
for
certainly
she
could
have
no
acquaintances
among
the
humble
who
inhabited
the
quarter
then
she
examined
the
garden
with
pleased
curiosity
and
finally
placed
the
backs
of
her
two
hands
from
which
she
had
drawn
her
gloves
against
her
lover
mouth
then
she
took
his
arm
at
every
step
she
kept
repeating
my
how
pretty
it
is
how
unexpected
how
attractive
catching
sight
of
the
that
the
sun
was
shining
upon
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
she
exclaimed
why
this
is
fairyland
my
friend
she
plucked
a
rose
kissed
it
and
placed
it
in
her
corsage
then
they
entered
the
pavilion
and
she
seemed
so
pleased
with
everything
that
he
felt
like
going
down
on
his
knees
to
her
although
he
may
have
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
perhaps
she
might
as
well
have
shown
more
attention
to
him
and
less
to
the
surroundings
she
looked
about
her
with
the
pleasure
of
a
child
who
has
received
a
new
plaything
and
admired
and
appreciated
the
elegance
of
the
place
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
connoisseur
whose
tastes
have
been
gratified
she
had
feared
that
she
was
coming
to
some
vulgar
commonplace
resort
where
the
furniture
and
hangings
had
been
contaminated
by
other
rendezvous
whereas
all
this
on
the
contrary
was
new
unforeseen
and
alluring
prepared
expressly
for
her
and
must
have
cost
a
lot
of
money
really
he
was
perfect
this
man
she
turned
to
him
and
extended
her
arms
and
their
lips
met
in
one
of
those
long
kisses
that
have
the
strange
twofold
sensation
of
and
unadulterated
bliss
when
at
the
end
of
three
hours
they
were
about
to
separate
they
walked
through
the
garden
and
seated
themselves
in
a
leafy
arbor
where
no
eye
could
reach
them
andré
addressed
her
with
an
exuberance
of
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
an
idol
that
had
come
down
for
his
sake
from
her
sacred
pedestal
and
she
listened
to
him
with
that
fatigued
languor
which
he
had
often
seen
reflected
in
her
eyes
after
people
had
tired
her
by
too
long
a
visit
she
continued
affectionate
however
her
face
lighted
up
by
a
tender
slightly
constrained
smile
and
she
clasped
the
hand
that
she
held
in
hers
with
a
continuous
pressure
that
perhaps
was
more
studied
than
spontaneous
she
could
not
have
been
listening
to
him
for
she
interrupted
one
of
his
sentences
to
say
really
i
must
be
going
i
was
to
be
at
the
marquise
de
bratiane
at
six
and
i
shall
be
very
late
he
conducted
her
to
the
gate
by
which
she
had
obtained
admission
they
gave
each
other
a
parting
kiss
and
after
a
furtive
glance
up
and
down
the
street
she
hurried
away
keeping
close
to
the
walls
when
he
was
alone
he
felt
within
him
that
sudden
void
that
is
ever
left
by
the
disappearance
of
the
woman
whose
kiss
is
still
warm
upon
your
lips
the
queer
little
laceration
of
the
heart
that
is
caused
by
the
sound
of
her
retreating
footsteps
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
abandoned
and
alone
that
he
was
never
to
see
her
again
and
he
betook
himself
to
pacing
the
reflecting
upon
this
contrast
between
anticipation
and
realization
he
remained
there
until
it
was
dark
gradually
becoming
more
tranquil
and
yielding
himself
more
entirely
to
her
influence
now
that
she
was
away
than
if
she
had
been
there
in
his
arms
then
he
went
home
and
dined
without
being
conscious
of
what
he
was
eating
and
sat
down
to
write
to
her
the
next
day
was
a
long
one
to
him
and
the
evening
seemed
interminable
why
had
she
not
answered
his
letter
why
had
she
sent
him
no
word
the
morning
of
the
second
day
he
received
a
short
telegram
appointing
another
rendezvous
at
the
same
hour
the
little
blue
envelope
speedily
cured
him
of
the
of
hope
deferred
from
which
he
was
beginning
to
suffer
she
came
as
she
had
done
before
punctual
smiling
and
affectionate
and
their
second
interview
in
the
little
house
was
in
all
respects
similar
to
the
first
andré
mariolle
surprised
at
first
and
vaguely
troubled
that
the
ecstatic
passion
he
had
dreamed
of
had
not
made
itself
felt
between
them
but
more
and
more
overmastered
by
his
senses
gradually
forgot
his
visions
of
anticipation
in
the
somewhat
different
happiness
of
possession
he
was
becoming
attached
to
her
by
reason
of
her
caresses
an
invincible
tie
the
strongest
tie
of
all
from
which
there
is
no
deliverance
when
once
it
has
fully
possessed
you
and
has
penetrated
through
your
flesh
into
your
veins
twenty
days
rolled
by
such
sweet
fleeting
days
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
to
be
no
end
to
it
that
he
was
to
live
forever
thus
nonexistent
for
all
and
living
for
her
alone
and
to
his
mental
vision
there
presented
itself
the
seductive
dream
of
an
unlimited
continuance
of
this
blissful
secret
way
of
living
she
continued
to
make
her
visits
at
intervals
of
three
days
offering
no
objections
attracted
it
would
seem
as
much
by
the
amusement
she
derived
from
their
clandestine
meetings
by
the
charm
of
the
little
house
that
had
now
been
transformed
into
a
conservatory
of
rare
exotics
and
by
the
novelty
of
the
situation
which
could
scarcely
be
called
dangerous
since
she
was
her
own
mistress
but
still
was
full
of
mystery
as
by
the
abject
and
constantly
increasing
tenderness
of
her
lover
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
she
said
to
him
now
my
dear
friend
you
must
show
yourself
in
society
again
you
will
come
and
pass
the
afternoon
with
me
i
have
given
out
that
you
are
at
home
again
he
was
heartbroken
oh
why
so
soon
he
said
because
if
it
should
leak
out
by
any
chance
that
you
are
in
paris
your
absence
would
be
too
inexplicable
not
to
give
rise
to
gossip
he
saw
that
she
was
right
and
promised
that
he
would
come
to
her
house
the
next
day
then
he
asked
her
do
you
receive
yes
she
replied
it
will
be
quite
a
little
solemnity
he
did
not
like
this
intelligence
of
what
description
is
your
solemnity
she
laughed
gleefully
i
have
prevailed
upon
massival
by
means
of
the
grossest
sycophancy
to
give
a
performance
of
his
which
no
one
has
heard
yet
it
is
the
poetry
of
antique
love
mme
de
bratiane
who
considered
herself
massival
sole
proprietor
is
furious
she
will
be
there
for
she
is
to
sing
am
i
not
a
sly
one
will
there
be
many
there
oh
no
only
a
few
intimate
friends
you
know
them
nearly
all
wo
you
let
me
off
i
am
so
happy
in
my
solitude
oh
no
my
friend
you
know
that
i
count
on
you
more
than
all
the
rest
his
heart
gave
a
great
thump
thank
you
he
said
i
will
come
chapter
vi
questionings
good
day
m
mariolle
mariolle
noticed
that
it
was
no
longer
the
dear
friend
of
auteuil
and
the
clasp
of
the
hand
was
a
hurried
one
the
hasty
pressure
of
a
busy
woman
wholly
engrossed
in
her
social
functions
as
he
entered
the
salon
mme
de
burne
was
advancing
to
speak
to
the
beautiful
mme
le
prieur
whose
sculpturesque
form
and
the
audacious
way
that
she
had
of
dressing
to
display
it
had
caused
her
to
be
nicknamed
somewhat
ironically
the
goddess
she
was
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
institute
of
the
section
of
inscriptions
and
ah
mariolle
exclaimed
lamarthe
where
do
you
come
from
we
thought
that
you
were
dead
i
have
been
making
a
trip
through
finistère
he
was
going
on
to
relate
his
impressions
when
the
novelist
interrupted
him
are
you
acquainted
with
the
baronne
de
frémines
only
by
sight
but
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
her
they
say
that
she
is
queer
the
very
queen
of
crazy
women
but
with
an
exquisite
perfume
of
modernness
come
and
let
me
present
you
to
her
taking
him
by
the
arm
he
led
him
toward
a
young
woman
who
was
always
compared
to
a
doll
a
pale
and
charming
little
blond
doll
invented
and
created
by
the
devil
himself
for
the
damnation
of
those
larger
children
who
wear
beards
on
their
faces
she
had
long
narrow
eyes
slightly
turned
up
toward
the
temples
apparently
like
the
eyes
of
the
chinese
their
soft
blue
glances
stole
out
between
lids
that
were
seldom
opened
to
their
full
extent
heavy
lids
designed
to
veil
and
hide
this
creature
mysterious
nature
her
hair
very
light
in
color
shone
with
silky
silvery
reflections
and
her
delicate
mouth
with
its
thin
lips
seemed
to
have
been
cut
by
the
light
hand
of
a
sculptor
from
the
design
of
a
the
voice
that
issued
from
it
had
intonations
and
the
audacity
of
her
ideas
of
a
biting
quality
that
was
peculiar
to
herself
smacking
of
wickedness
and
drollery
their
destructive
charm
their
cold
corrupting
seductiveness
all
the
complicated
nature
of
this
mentally
diseased
child
acted
upon
those
who
were
brought
in
contact
with
her
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
in
them
violent
passions
and
disturbances
she
was
known
all
over
paris
as
being
the
most
extravagant
of
the
of
the
real
and
also
the
wittiest
but
no
one
could
say
exactly
what
she
was
what
were
her
ideas
what
she
did
she
exercised
an
irresistible
sway
over
mankind
in
general
her
husband
also
was
quite
as
much
of
an
enigma
as
she
courteous
and
affable
and
a
great
nobleman
he
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
was
he
indifferent
or
complaisant
or
was
he
simply
blind
perhaps
after
all
there
was
nothing
in
it
more
than
those
little
eccentricities
which
doubtless
amused
him
as
much
as
they
did
her
all
sorts
of
opinions
however
were
prevalent
in
regard
to
him
and
some
very
ugly
reports
were
circulated
rumor
even
went
so
far
as
to
insinuate
that
his
wife
secret
vices
were
not
unprofitable
to
him
between
her
and
mme
de
burne
there
were
natural
attractions
and
fierce
jealousies
spells
of
friendship
succeeded
by
crises
of
furious
enmity
they
liked
and
feared
each
other
and
mutually
sought
each
society
like
professional
duelists
who
appreciate
at
the
same
time
that
they
would
be
glad
to
kill
each
other
it
was
the
baronne
de
frémines
who
was
having
the
upper
hand
at
this
moment
she
had
just
scored
a
victory
an
important
victory
she
had
conquered
lamarthe
had
taken
him
from
her
rival
and
borne
him
away
ostentatiously
to
domesticate
him
in
her
flock
of
acknowledged
followers
the
novelist
seemed
to
be
all
at
once
smitten
puzzled
charmed
and
stupefied
by
the
discoveries
he
had
made
in
this
creature
and
he
could
not
help
talking
about
her
to
everybody
that
he
met
a
fact
which
had
already
given
rise
to
much
gossip
just
as
he
was
presenting
mariolle
he
encountered
mme
de
burne
look
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
smiled
and
whispered
in
his
ear
see
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
angry
andré
raised
his
eyes
but
madame
had
turned
to
meet
massival
who
just
then
made
his
appearance
beneath
the
raised
portière
he
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
marquise
de
bratiane
which
elicited
from
lamarthe
ah
we
shall
only
have
a
second
rendition
of
the
first
has
just
been
given
in
the
marquise
mme
de
frémines
added
really
our
friend
de
burne
collection
is
losing
some
of
its
finest
jewels
mariolle
felt
a
sudden
impulse
of
anger
rising
in
his
heart
a
kind
of
hatred
against
this
woman
and
a
brusque
sensation
of
irritation
against
these
people
their
way
of
life
their
ideas
their
tastes
their
aimless
inclinations
their
childish
amusements
then
as
lamarthe
bent
over
the
young
woman
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear
he
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
slip
away
handsome
mme
le
prieur
was
sitting
by
herself
only
a
few
steps
away
he
went
up
to
her
to
make
his
bow
according
to
lamarthe
she
stood
for
the
old
guard
among
all
this
irruption
of
modernism
young
tall
handsome
with
very
regular
features
and
chestnut
hair
through
which
ran
threads
of
gold
extremely
affable
captivating
by
reason
of
her
tranquil
kindly
charm
of
manner
by
reason
also
of
a
calm
coquetry
and
a
great
desire
to
please
that
lay
concealed
beneath
an
outward
appearance
of
simple
and
sincere
affection
she
had
many
firm
partisans
whom
she
took
good
care
should
never
be
exposed
to
dangerous
rivalries
her
house
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
little
gathering
of
intimate
friends
where
all
the
moreover
concurred
in
extolling
the
merits
of
the
husband
she
and
mariolle
now
entered
into
conversation
she
held
in
high
esteem
this
intelligent
and
reserved
man
who
gave
people
so
little
cause
to
talk
about
him
and
who
was
perhaps
of
more
account
than
all
the
rest
the
remaining
guests
came
dropping
in
big
fresnel
puffing
and
giving
a
last
wipe
with
his
handkerchief
to
his
shining
and
perspiring
forehead
the
philosophic
george
de
maltry
finally
the
baron
de
gravil
accompanied
by
the
comte
de
marantin
de
pradon
assisted
his
daughter
in
doing
the
honors
of
the
house
he
was
extremely
attractive
to
mariolle
but
mariolle
with
a
heavy
heart
saw
going
and
coming
and
bestowing
her
attentions
on
everyone
there
more
than
on
him
twice
it
is
true
she
had
thrown
him
a
swift
look
from
a
distance
which
seemed
to
say
i
am
not
forgetting
you
but
they
were
so
fleeting
that
perhaps
he
had
failed
to
catch
their
meaning
and
then
he
could
not
be
unconscious
to
the
fact
that
lamarthe
aggressive
assiduities
to
mme
de
frémines
were
displeasing
to
mme
de
burne
that
is
only
her
coquettish
feeling
of
spite
he
said
to
himself
a
woman
irritation
from
whose
salon
some
valuable
trinket
has
been
spirited
away
still
it
made
him
suffer
and
his
suffering
was
the
greater
since
he
saw
that
she
was
constantly
watching
them
in
a
furtive
concealed
kind
of
way
while
she
did
not
seem
to
trouble
herself
a
bit
at
seeing
sitting
beside
mme
le
prieur
the
reason
was
that
she
had
him
in
her
power
she
was
sure
of
him
while
the
other
was
escaping
her
what
then
could
be
to
her
that
love
of
theirs
that
love
which
was
born
but
yesterday
and
which
in
him
had
banished
and
killed
every
other
idea
de
pradon
had
called
for
silence
and
massival
was
opening
the
piano
which
mme
de
bratiane
was
approaching
removing
her
gloves
meanwhile
for
she
was
to
sing
the
woes
of
dido
when
the
door
again
opened
and
a
young
man
appeared
upon
whom
every
eye
was
immediately
fixed
he
was
tall
and
slender
with
curling
short
blond
curly
hair
and
an
air
that
was
altogether
aristocratic
even
mme
le
prieur
seemed
to
feel
his
influence
who
is
it
mariolle
asked
her
what
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
him
no
i
do
not
it
is
comte
rudolph
de
bernhaus
ah
the
man
who
fought
a
duel
with
sigismond
fabre
yes
the
story
had
made
a
great
noise
at
the
time
the
comte
de
bernhaus
attached
to
the
austrian
embassy
and
a
diplomat
of
the
highest
promise
an
elegant
bismarck
so
it
was
said
having
heard
some
words
spoken
in
derogation
of
his
sovereign
at
an
official
reception
had
fought
the
next
day
with
the
man
who
uttered
them
a
celebrated
fencer
and
killed
him
after
this
duel
in
respect
to
which
public
opinion
had
been
divided
the
comte
acquired
between
one
day
and
the
next
a
notoriety
after
the
manner
of
sarah
bernhardt
but
with
this
difference
that
his
name
appeared
in
an
aureole
of
poetic
chivalry
he
was
in
addition
a
man
of
great
charm
an
agreeable
conversationalist
a
man
of
distinction
in
every
respect
lamarthe
used
to
say
of
him
he
is
the
one
to
tame
our
pretty
wild
beasts
he
took
his
seat
beside
mme
de
burne
with
a
very
gallant
air
and
massival
sat
down
before
the
keyboard
and
allowed
his
fingers
to
run
over
the
keys
for
a
few
moments
nearly
all
the
audience
changed
their
places
and
drew
their
chairs
nearer
so
as
to
hear
better
and
at
the
same
time
have
a
better
view
of
the
singer
thus
mariolle
and
lamarthe
found
themselves
side
by
side
there
was
a
great
silence
of
expectation
and
respectful
attention
then
the
musician
began
with
a
slow
a
very
slow
succession
of
notes
something
like
a
musical
recitative
there
were
pauses
then
the
air
would
be
lightly
caught
up
in
a
series
of
little
phrases
now
languishing
and
dying
away
now
breaking
out
in
nervous
strength
indicative
it
would
seem
of
distressful
emotion
but
always
characterized
by
originality
of
invention
mariolle
gave
way
to
reverie
he
beheld
a
woman
a
woman
in
the
fullness
of
her
mature
youth
and
ripened
beauty
walking
slowly
upon
a
shore
that
was
bathed
by
the
waves
of
the
sea
he
knew
that
she
was
suffering
that
she
bore
a
great
sorrow
in
her
soul
and
he
looked
at
mme
de
bratiane
motionless
pale
beneath
her
wealth
of
thick
black
hair
that
seemed
to
have
been
dipped
in
the
shades
of
night
the
italian
stood
waiting
her
glance
directed
straight
before
her
on
her
strongly
marked
rather
stern
features
against
which
her
eyes
and
eyebrows
stood
out
like
spots
of
ink
in
all
her
dark
powerful
and
passionate
beauty
there
was
something
that
struck
one
something
like
the
threat
of
the
coming
storm
that
we
read
in
the
blackening
massival
slightly
nodding
his
head
with
its
long
hair
in
cadence
with
the
rhythm
kept
on
relating
the
affecting
tale
that
he
was
drawing
from
the
resonant
keys
of
ivory
a
shiver
all
at
once
ran
through
the
singer
she
partially
opened
her
mouth
and
from
it
there
proceeded
a
heartrending
wail
of
agony
it
was
not
one
of
those
outbursts
of
tragic
despair
that
divas
give
utterance
to
upon
the
stage
with
dramatic
gestures
neither
was
it
one
of
those
pitiful
laments
for
love
betrayed
that
bring
a
storm
of
bravos
from
an
audience
it
was
a
cry
of
supreme
passion
coming
from
the
body
and
not
from
the
soul
wrung
from
her
like
the
roar
of
a
wounded
animal
the
cry
of
the
feminine
animal
betrayed
then
she
was
silent
and
massival
again
began
to
relate
more
animatedly
more
stormily
the
moving
story
of
the
miserable
queen
who
was
abandoned
by
the
man
she
loved
then
the
woman
voice
made
itself
heard
again
she
used
articulate
language
now
she
told
of
the
intolerable
torture
of
solitude
of
her
unquenchable
thirst
for
the
caresses
that
were
hers
no
more
and
of
the
grief
of
knowing
that
he
was
gone
from
her
forever
her
warm
ringing
voice
made
the
hearts
of
her
audience
beat
beneath
the
spell
this
somber
italian
with
hair
like
the
darkness
of
the
night
seemed
to
be
suffering
all
the
sorrows
that
she
was
telling
she
seemed
to
love
or
to
have
the
capacity
of
loving
with
furious
ardor
when
she
ceased
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
she
slowly
wiped
them
away
lamarthe
leaned
over
toward
mariolle
and
said
to
him
in
a
quiver
of
artistic
enthusiasm
good
heavens
how
beautiful
she
is
just
now
she
is
a
woman
the
only
one
in
the
room
then
he
added
after
a
moment
of
reflection
after
all
who
can
tell
perhaps
there
is
nothing
there
but
the
mirage
of
the
music
for
nothing
has
real
existence
except
our
illusions
but
what
an
art
to
produce
illusions
is
that
of
hers
there
was
a
short
intermission
between
the
first
and
the
second
parts
of
the
musical
poem
and
warm
congratulations
were
extended
to
the
composer
and
his
interpreter
lamarthe
in
particular
was
very
earnest
in
his
felicitations
and
he
was
really
sincere
for
he
was
endowed
with
the
capacity
to
feel
and
comprehend
and
beauty
of
all
kinds
appealed
strongly
to
his
nature
under
whatever
form
expressed
the
manner
in
which
he
told
mme
de
bratiane
what
his
feelings
had
been
while
listening
to
her
was
so
flattering
that
it
brought
a
slight
blush
to
her
face
and
excited
a
little
spiteful
feeling
among
the
other
women
who
heard
it
perhaps
he
was
not
altogether
unaware
of
the
feeling
that
he
had
produced
when
he
turned
around
to
resume
his
chair
he
perceived
comte
de
bernhaus
just
in
the
act
of
seating
himself
beside
mme
de
frémines
she
seemed
at
once
to
be
on
confidential
terms
with
him
and
they
smiled
at
each
other
as
if
this
close
conversation
was
particularly
agreeable
to
them
both
mariolle
whose
gloom
was
momentarily
increasing
stood
leaning
against
a
door
the
novelist
came
and
stationed
himself
at
his
side
big
fresnel
george
de
maltry
the
baron
de
gravil
and
the
comte
de
marantin
formed
a
circle
about
mme
de
burne
who
was
going
about
offering
tea
she
seemed
imprisoned
in
a
crown
of
adorers
lamarthe
ironically
called
his
friend
attention
to
it
and
added
a
crown
without
jewels
however
and
i
am
sure
that
she
would
be
glad
to
give
all
those
rhinestones
for
the
brilliant
that
she
would
like
to
see
there
what
brilliant
do
you
mean
inquired
mariolle
why
bernhaus
handsome
irresistible
incomparable
bernhaus
he
in
whose
honor
this
is
given
for
whom
the
miracle
was
performed
of
inducing
massival
to
bring
out
his
here
andré
though
incredulous
was
conscious
of
a
pang
of
regret
as
he
heard
these
words
has
she
known
him
long
he
asked
oh
no
ten
days
at
most
but
she
put
her
best
foot
foremost
during
this
brief
campaign
and
her
tactics
have
been
those
of
a
conqueror
if
you
had
been
here
you
would
have
had
a
good
laugh
how
so
she
met
him
for
the
first
time
at
mme
de
frémines
i
happened
to
be
dining
there
that
evening
bernhaus
stands
very
well
in
the
good
graces
of
the
lady
of
that
house
as
you
may
see
for
yourself
all
that
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
them
at
the
present
moment
and
behold
in
the
very
minute
that
succeeded
the
first
salutation
that
they
ever
made
each
other
there
is
our
pretty
friend
de
burne
taking
the
field
to
effect
the
conquest
of
the
austrian
phœnix
and
she
is
succeeding
and
will
succeed
although
the
little
frémines
is
more
than
a
match
for
her
in
coquetry
real
indifference
and
perhaps
perversity
but
our
friend
de
burne
uses
her
weapons
more
scientifically
she
is
more
of
a
woman
by
which
i
mean
a
modern
woman
that
is
to
say
irresistible
by
reason
of
that
artificial
seductiveness
which
takes
the
place
in
the
modern
woman
of
the
natural
charm
of
manner
and
it
is
not
her
artificiality
alone
that
is
to
be
taken
into
account
but
her
æstheticism
her
profound
comprehension
of
feminine
æsthetics
all
her
strength
lies
therein
she
knows
herself
thoroughly
because
she
takes
more
delight
in
herself
than
in
anything
else
and
she
is
never
at
fault
as
to
the
best
means
of
subjugating
a
man
and
making
the
best
use
of
her
gifts
in
order
to
captivate
men
mariolle
took
exception
to
this
i
think
that
you
put
it
too
strongly
he
said
she
has
always
been
very
simple
with
me
because
simplicity
is
the
right
thing
to
meet
the
requirements
of
your
case
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
ill
of
her
however
i
think
that
she
is
better
than
most
of
her
set
but
they
are
not
women
massival
striking
a
few
chords
on
the
piano
here
reduced
them
to
silence
and
mme
de
bratiane
proceeded
to
sing
the
second
part
of
the
poem
in
which
her
delineation
of
the
was
a
magnificent
study
of
physical
passion
and
sensual
regret
lamarthe
however
never
once
took
his
eyes
from
mme
de
frémines
and
the
comte
de
bernhaus
where
they
were
enjoying
their
and
as
soon
as
the
last
vibrations
of
the
piano
were
lost
in
the
murmurs
of
applause
he
again
took
up
his
theme
as
if
in
continuation
of
an
argument
or
as
if
he
were
replying
to
an
adversary
no
they
are
not
women
the
most
honest
of
them
are
coquettes
without
being
aware
of
it
the
more
i
know
them
the
less
do
i
find
in
them
that
sensation
of
mild
exhilaration
that
it
is
the
part
of
a
true
woman
to
inspire
in
us
they
intoxicate
it
is
true
but
the
process
wears
upon
our
nerves
for
they
are
too
sophisticated
oh
it
is
very
good
as
a
liqueur
to
sip
now
and
then
but
it
is
a
poor
substitute
for
the
good
wine
that
we
used
to
have
you
see
my
dear
fellow
woman
was
created
and
sent
to
dwell
on
earth
for
two
objects
only
and
it
is
these
two
objects
alone
that
can
avail
to
bring
out
her
true
great
and
noble
qualities
love
and
the
family
i
am
talking
like
prudhomme
now
the
women
of
are
incapable
of
loving
and
they
will
not
bear
children
when
they
are
so
inexpert
as
to
have
them
it
is
a
misfortune
in
their
eyes
then
a
burden
truly
they
are
not
women
they
are
monsters
astonished
by
the
writer
violent
manner
and
by
the
angry
look
that
glistened
in
his
eye
mariolle
asked
him
why
then
do
you
spend
half
your
time
hanging
to
their
skirts
lamarthe
hotly
replied
why
why
because
it
interests
me
and
then
and
then
would
you
prevent
a
physician
from
going
to
the
hospitals
to
watch
the
cases
those
women
constitute
my
clinic
this
reflection
seemed
to
quiet
him
a
little
he
proceeded
then
too
i
adore
them
for
the
very
reason
that
they
are
so
modern
at
bottom
i
am
really
no
more
a
man
than
they
are
women
when
i
am
at
the
point
of
becoming
attached
to
one
of
them
i
amuse
myself
by
investigating
and
analyzing
all
the
resulting
sensations
and
emotions
just
like
a
chemist
who
experiments
upon
himself
with
a
poison
in
order
to
ascertain
its
properties
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
continued
in
this
way
they
will
never
succeed
in
getting
me
into
their
clutches
can
play
their
game
as
well
as
they
play
it
themselves
perhaps
even
better
and
that
is
of
use
to
me
for
my
books
while
their
proceedings
are
not
of
the
slightest
bit
of
use
to
them
what
fools
they
are
failures
every
one
of
them
charming
failures
who
will
be
ready
to
die
of
spite
as
they
grow
older
and
see
the
mistake
that
they
have
made
mariolle
as
he
listened
felt
himself
sinking
into
one
of
those
fits
of
depression
that
are
like
the
humid
gloom
with
which
a
rain
darkens
everything
about
us
he
was
well
aware
that
the
man
of
letters
as
a
general
thing
was
not
apt
to
be
very
far
out
of
the
way
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
admit
that
he
was
altogether
right
in
the
present
case
with
a
slight
appearance
of
irritation
he
argued
not
so
much
in
defense
of
women
as
to
show
the
causes
of
the
position
that
they
occupy
in
contemporary
literature
in
the
days
when
poets
and
novelists
exalted
them
and
endowed
them
with
poetic
attributes
he
said
they
looked
for
in
life
and
seemed
to
find
that
which
their
heart
had
discovered
in
their
reading
nowadays
you
persist
in
suppressing
everything
that
has
any
savor
of
sentiment
and
poetry
and
in
its
stead
give
them
only
naked
undeceiving
realities
now
my
dear
sir
the
more
love
there
is
in
books
the
more
love
there
is
in
life
when
you
invented
the
ideal
and
laid
it
before
them
they
believed
in
the
truth
of
your
inventions
now
that
you
give
them
nothing
but
stern
unadorned
realism
they
follow
in
your
footsteps
and
have
come
to
measure
everything
by
that
standard
of
vulgarity
lamarthe
who
was
always
ready
for
a
literary
discussion
was
about
to
commence
a
dissertation
when
mme
de
burne
came
up
to
them
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
she
looked
at
her
best
with
a
toilette
that
delighted
the
eye
and
with
that
aggressive
and
alluring
air
that
denoted
that
she
was
ready
to
try
conclusions
with
anyone
she
took
a
chair
that
is
what
i
like
she
said
to
come
upon
two
men
and
find
that
they
are
not
talking
about
me
and
then
you
are
the
only
men
here
that
one
can
listen
to
with
any
interest
what
was
the
subject
that
you
were
discussing
lamarthe
quite
without
embarrassment
and
in
terms
of
elegant
raillery
placed
before
her
the
question
that
had
arisen
between
himself
and
mariolle
then
he
resumed
his
reasoning
with
a
spirit
that
was
inflamed
by
that
desire
of
applause
which
in
the
presence
of
women
always
excites
men
who
like
to
intoxicate
themselves
with
glory
she
at
once
interested
herself
in
the
discussion
and
warming
to
the
subject
took
part
in
it
in
defense
of
the
women
of
our
day
with
a
good
deal
of
wit
and
ingenuity
some
remarks
upon
the
faithfulness
and
the
attachment
that
even
those
who
were
looked
on
with
most
suspicion
might
be
capable
of
incomprehensible
to
the
novelist
made
mariolle
heart
beat
more
rapidly
and
when
she
left
them
to
take
a
seat
beside
mme
de
frémines
who
had
persistently
kept
the
comte
de
bernhaus
near
her
lamarthe
and
mariolle
completely
vanquished
by
her
display
of
feminine
tact
and
grace
were
united
in
declaring
that
beyond
all
question
she
was
exquisite
and
just
look
at
them
said
the
writer
the
grand
duel
was
on
what
were
they
talking
about
now
the
austrian
and
those
two
women
mme
de
burne
had
come
up
just
at
the
right
moment
to
interrupt
a
which
however
agreeable
the
two
persons
engaged
in
it
might
be
to
each
other
was
becoming
monotonous
from
being
too
long
protracted
and
she
broke
it
up
by
relating
with
an
indignant
air
the
expressions
that
she
had
heard
from
lamarthe
lips
to
be
sure
it
was
all
applicable
to
mme
de
frémines
it
all
resulted
from
her
most
recent
conquest
and
it
was
all
related
in
the
hearing
of
an
intelligent
man
who
was
capable
of
understanding
it
in
all
its
bearings
the
match
was
applied
and
again
the
everlasting
question
of
love
blazed
up
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
beckoned
to
mariolle
and
lamarthe
to
come
to
them
then
as
their
voices
grew
loud
in
debate
she
summoned
the
remainder
of
the
company
a
general
discussion
ensued
bright
and
animated
in
which
everyone
had
something
to
say
mme
de
burne
was
witty
and
entertaining
beyond
all
the
rest
shifting
her
ground
from
sentiment
which
might
have
been
factitious
to
droll
paradox
the
day
was
a
triumphant
one
for
her
and
she
was
prettier
brighter
and
more
animated
than
she
had
ever
been
chapter
vii
depression
when
andré
mariolle
had
parted
from
mme
de
burne
and
the
penetrating
charm
of
her
presence
had
faded
away
he
felt
within
him
and
all
about
him
in
his
flesh
in
his
heart
in
the
air
and
in
all
the
surrounding
world
a
sensation
as
if
the
delight
of
life
which
had
been
his
support
and
animating
principle
for
some
time
past
had
been
taken
from
him
what
had
happened
nothing
or
almost
nothing
toward
the
close
of
the
reception
she
had
been
very
charming
in
her
manner
toward
him
saying
to
him
more
than
once
i
am
not
conscious
of
anyone
presence
here
but
yours
and
yet
he
felt
that
she
had
revealed
something
to
him
of
which
he
would
have
preferred
always
to
remain
ignorant
that
too
was
nothing
or
almost
nothing
still
he
was
stupefied
as
a
man
might
be
upon
hearing
of
some
unworthy
action
of
his
father
or
his
mother
to
learn
that
during
those
twenty
days
which
he
had
believed
were
absolutely
and
entirely
devoted
by
her
as
well
as
by
him
every
minute
of
them
to
the
sentiment
of
their
newborn
love
so
recent
and
so
intense
she
had
resumed
her
former
mode
of
life
had
made
many
visits
formed
many
plans
recommenced
those
odious
flirtations
had
run
after
men
and
disputed
them
with
her
rivals
received
compliments
and
showed
off
all
her
graces
so
soon
all
this
she
had
done
so
soon
had
it
happened
later
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
he
knew
the
world
he
knew
women
and
their
ways
of
looking
at
things
he
was
sufficiently
intelligent
to
understand
it
all
and
would
never
have
been
unduly
exacting
or
offensively
jealous
she
was
beautiful
she
was
born
it
was
her
allotted
destiny
to
receive
the
homage
of
men
and
listen
to
their
soft
nothings
she
had
selected
him
from
among
them
all
and
had
bestowed
herself
upon
him
courageously
royally
it
was
his
part
to
remain
he
would
remain
in
any
event
a
grateful
slave
to
her
caprices
and
a
resigned
spectator
of
her
triumphs
as
a
pretty
woman
but
it
was
hard
on
him
something
suffered
within
him
in
that
obscure
cavern
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
heart
where
the
delicate
sensibilities
have
their
dwelling
no
doubt
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
he
had
always
been
in
the
wrong
since
he
first
came
to
know
himself
he
carried
too
much
sentimental
prudence
into
his
commerce
with
the
world
his
feelings
were
too
this
was
the
cause
of
the
isolated
life
that
he
had
always
led
through
his
dread
of
contact
with
the
world
and
of
wounded
susceptibilities
he
had
been
wrong
for
this
supersensitiveness
is
almost
always
the
result
of
our
not
admitting
the
existence
of
a
nature
essentially
different
from
our
own
or
else
not
tolerating
it
he
knew
this
having
often
observed
it
in
himself
but
it
was
too
late
to
modify
the
constitution
of
his
being
he
certainly
had
no
right
to
reproach
mme
de
burne
for
if
she
had
forbidden
him
her
salon
and
kept
him
in
hiding
during
those
days
of
happiness
that
she
had
afforded
him
she
had
done
it
to
blind
prying
eyes
and
be
more
fully
his
in
the
end
why
then
this
trouble
that
had
settled
in
his
heart
ah
why
it
was
because
he
had
believed
her
to
be
wholly
his
and
now
it
had
been
made
clear
to
him
that
he
could
never
expect
to
seize
and
hold
this
woman
of
a
nature
who
belonged
to
all
the
world
he
was
well
aware
moreover
that
all
our
life
is
made
up
of
successes
relative
in
degree
to
the
almost
and
up
to
the
present
time
he
had
borne
this
with
philosophic
resignation
dissembling
his
dissatisfaction
and
his
unsatisfied
yearnings
under
the
mask
of
an
assumed
unsociability
this
time
he
had
thought
that
he
was
about
to
obtain
an
absolute
success
the
entirely
that
he
had
been
waiting
and
hoping
for
all
his
life
the
entirely
is
not
to
be
attained
in
this
world
his
evening
was
a
dismal
one
spent
in
analyzing
the
painful
impression
that
he
had
received
when
he
was
in
bed
this
impression
instead
of
growing
weaker
took
stronger
hold
of
him
and
as
he
desired
to
leave
nothing
unexplored
he
ransacked
his
mind
to
ascertain
the
remotest
causes
of
his
new
troubles
they
went
and
came
and
returned
again
like
little
breaths
of
frosty
air
exciting
in
his
love
a
suffering
that
was
as
yet
weak
and
indistinct
like
those
vague
neuralgic
pains
that
we
get
by
sitting
in
a
draft
presages
of
the
horrible
agonies
that
are
to
come
he
understood
in
the
first
place
that
he
was
jealous
no
longer
as
the
ardent
lover
only
but
as
one
who
had
the
right
to
call
her
his
own
as
long
as
he
had
not
seen
her
surrounded
by
men
her
men
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
dwell
upon
this
sensation
at
the
same
time
having
a
faint
prevision
of
it
but
supposing
that
it
would
be
different
very
different
from
what
it
actually
was
to
find
the
mistress
whom
he
believed
had
cared
for
none
but
him
during
those
days
of
secret
and
frequent
meetings
during
that
early
period
that
should
have
been
entirely
devoted
to
isolation
and
tender
emotion
to
find
her
as
much
and
even
more
interested
and
wrapped
up
in
her
former
and
frivolous
flirtations
than
she
was
before
she
yielded
herself
to
him
always
ready
to
fritter
away
her
time
and
attention
on
any
chance
comer
thus
leaving
but
little
of
herself
to
him
whom
she
had
designated
as
the
man
of
her
choice
caused
him
a
jealousy
that
was
more
of
the
flesh
than
of
the
feelings
not
an
undefined
jealousy
like
a
fever
that
lies
latent
in
the
system
but
a
jealousy
precise
and
well
defined
for
he
was
doubtful
of
her
at
first
his
doubts
were
instinctive
arising
in
a
sensation
of
distrust
that
had
intruded
itself
into
his
veins
rather
than
into
his
thoughts
in
that
sense
of
dissatisfaction
almost
physical
of
the
man
who
is
not
sure
of
his
mate
then
having
doubted
he
began
to
suspect
what
was
his
position
toward
her
after
all
was
he
her
first
lover
or
was
he
the
tenth
was
he
the
successor
of
de
burne
or
was
he
the
successor
of
lamarthe
massival
george
de
maltry
and
the
predecessor
as
well
perhaps
of
the
comte
de
bernhaus
what
did
he
know
of
her
that
she
was
surprisingly
beautiful
stylish
beyond
all
others
intelligent
discriminating
witty
but
at
the
same
time
fickle
quick
to
weary
readily
fatigued
and
disgusted
with
anyone
or
anything
and
above
all
else
in
love
with
herself
and
an
insatiable
coquette
had
she
had
a
lover
or
lovers
before
him
if
not
would
she
have
offered
herself
to
him
as
she
did
where
could
she
have
got
the
audacity
that
made
her
come
and
open
his
bedroom
door
at
night
in
a
public
inn
and
then
after
that
would
she
have
shown
such
readiness
to
visit
the
house
at
auteuil
before
going
there
she
had
merely
asked
him
a
few
questions
such
questions
as
an
experienced
and
prudent
woman
would
naturally
ask
he
had
answered
like
a
man
of
circumspection
not
unaccustomed
to
such
interviews
and
immediately
she
had
confidingly
said
yes
entirely
reassured
probably
benefiting
by
her
previous
experiences
and
then
her
knock
at
that
little
door
behind
which
he
was
waiting
with
a
beating
heart
almost
ready
to
faint
how
discreetly
authoritative
it
had
been
and
how
she
had
entered
without
any
visible
display
of
emotion
careful
only
to
observe
whether
she
might
be
recognized
from
the
adjacent
houses
and
the
way
that
she
had
made
herself
at
home
at
once
in
that
doubtful
lodging
that
he
had
hired
and
furnished
for
her
would
a
woman
who
was
a
novice
how
daring
soever
she
might
be
how
superior
to
considerations
of
morality
and
regardless
of
social
prejudices
have
penetrated
thus
calmly
the
mystery
of
a
first
rendezvous
there
is
a
trouble
of
the
mind
a
hesitation
of
the
body
an
instinctive
fear
in
the
very
feet
which
know
not
whither
they
are
tending
would
she
not
have
felt
all
that
unless
she
had
had
some
experience
in
these
excursions
of
love
and
unless
the
practice
of
these
things
had
dulled
her
native
sense
of
modesty
burning
with
this
persistent
irritating
fever
which
the
warmth
of
his
bed
seemed
to
render
still
more
unendurable
mariolle
tossed
beneath
the
coverings
constantly
drawn
on
by
his
chain
of
doubts
and
suppositions
like
a
man
that
feels
himself
irrecoverably
sliding
down
the
steep
descent
of
a
precipice
at
times
he
tried
to
call
a
halt
and
break
the
current
of
his
thoughts
he
sought
and
found
and
was
glad
to
find
reflections
that
were
more
just
to
her
and
reassuring
to
him
but
the
seeds
of
distrust
had
been
sown
in
him
and
he
could
not
help
their
growing
and
yet
with
what
had
he
to
reproach
her
nothing
except
that
her
nature
was
not
entirely
similar
to
his
own
that
she
did
not
look
upon
life
in
the
same
way
that
he
did
and
that
she
had
not
in
her
heart
an
instrument
of
sensibility
attuned
to
the
same
key
as
his
immediately
upon
awaking
next
morning
the
longing
to
see
her
and
to
his
confidence
in
her
developed
itself
within
him
like
a
ravening
hunger
and
he
awaited
the
proper
moment
to
go
and
pay
her
the
visit
demanded
by
custom
the
instant
that
she
saw
him
at
the
door
of
the
little
devoted
to
her
special
intimates
where
she
was
sitting
alone
occupied
with
her
correspondence
she
came
to
him
with
her
two
hands
outstretched
ah
good
day
dear
friend
she
said
with
so
pleased
and
frank
an
air
that
all
his
odious
suspicions
which
were
still
floating
indeterminately
in
his
brain
melted
away
beneath
the
warmth
of
her
reception
he
seated
himself
at
her
side
and
at
once
began
to
tell
her
of
the
manner
in
which
he
loved
her
for
their
love
was
now
no
longer
what
it
had
been
he
gently
gave
her
to
understand
that
there
are
two
species
of
the
race
of
lovers
upon
earth
those
whose
desire
is
that
of
madmen
and
whose
ardor
disappears
when
once
they
have
achieved
a
triumph
and
those
whom
possession
serves
to
subjugate
and
capture
in
whom
the
love
of
the
senses
blending
with
the
inarticulate
and
ineffable
appeals
that
the
heart
of
man
at
times
sends
forth
toward
a
woman
gives
rise
to
the
servitude
of
a
complete
and
torturing
love
torturing
it
is
certainly
and
forever
so
however
happy
it
may
be
for
nothing
even
in
the
moments
of
closest
communion
ever
sates
the
need
of
her
that
rules
our
being
mme
de
burne
was
charmed
and
gratified
as
she
listened
carried
away
as
one
is
carried
away
at
the
theater
when
an
actor
gives
a
powerful
interpretation
of
his
rôle
and
moves
us
by
awaking
some
slumbering
echo
in
our
own
life
it
was
indeed
an
echo
the
disturbing
echo
of
a
real
passion
but
it
was
not
from
her
bosom
that
this
passion
sent
forth
its
cry
still
she
felt
such
satisfaction
that
she
was
the
object
of
so
keen
a
sentiment
she
was
so
pleased
that
it
existed
in
a
man
who
was
capable
of
expressing
it
in
such
terms
in
a
man
of
whom
she
was
really
very
fond
for
whom
she
was
really
beginning
to
feel
an
attachment
and
whose
presence
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
necessity
to
her
not
for
her
physical
being
but
for
that
mysterious
feminine
nature
which
is
so
greedy
of
tenderness
devotion
and
subjection
that
she
felt
like
embracing
him
like
offering
him
her
mouth
her
whole
being
only
that
he
might
keep
on
worshiping
her
in
this
way
she
answered
him
frankly
and
without
prudery
with
that
profound
artfulness
that
certain
women
are
endowed
with
making
it
clear
to
him
that
he
too
had
made
great
progress
in
her
affections
and
they
remained
in
the
little
where
it
so
happened
that
no
one
came
that
day
until
twilight
talking
always
upon
the
same
theme
and
caressing
each
other
with
words
that
to
them
did
not
have
the
common
significance
the
servants
had
just
brought
in
the
lamps
when
mme
de
bratiane
appeared
mariolle
withdrew
and
as
mme
de
burne
was
accompanying
him
to
the
door
through
the
main
he
asked
her
when
shall
i
see
you
down
yonder
will
friday
suit
you
certainly
at
what
hour
the
same
three
until
friday
then
adieu
i
adore
you
during
the
two
days
that
passed
before
this
interview
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
loneliness
that
he
had
never
felt
before
in
the
same
way
a
woman
was
wanting
in
his
life
she
was
the
only
existent
object
for
him
in
the
world
and
as
this
woman
was
not
far
away
and
he
was
prevented
by
social
conventions
alone
from
going
to
her
and
from
passing
a
lifetime
with
her
he
chafed
in
his
solitude
in
the
interminable
lapse
of
the
moments
that
seemed
at
times
to
pass
so
slowly
at
the
absolute
impossibility
of
a
thing
that
was
so
easy
he
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
on
friday
three
hours
before
the
time
but
it
was
pleasing
to
him
it
comforted
his
anxiety
to
wait
there
where
she
was
soon
to
come
after
having
already
suffered
so
much
in
awaiting
her
mentally
in
places
where
she
was
not
to
come
he
stationed
himself
near
the
door
long
before
the
clock
had
struck
the
three
strokes
that
he
was
expecting
so
eagerly
and
when
at
last
he
heard
them
he
began
to
tremble
with
impatience
the
quarter
struck
he
looked
out
into
the
street
cautiously
protruding
his
head
between
the
door
and
the
casing
it
was
deserted
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
minutes
seemed
to
stretch
out
in
aggravating
slowness
he
was
constantly
drawing
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
at
last
when
the
hand
marked
the
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
had
been
standing
there
for
an
incalculable
length
of
time
suddenly
he
heard
a
faint
sound
upon
the
pavement
outside
and
the
summons
upon
the
door
of
the
little
gloved
hand
quickly
made
him
forget
his
disappointment
and
inspired
in
him
a
feeling
of
gratitude
toward
her
she
seemed
a
little
out
of
breath
as
she
asked
i
am
very
late
am
i
not
no
not
very
just
imagine
i
was
near
not
being
able
to
come
at
all
i
had
a
houseful
and
i
was
at
my
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
to
get
rid
of
all
those
people
tell
me
do
you
go
under
your
own
name
here
no
why
do
you
ask
so
that
i
may
send
you
a
telegram
if
i
should
ever
be
prevented
from
coming
i
am
known
as
m
nicolle
very
well
i
wo
forget
my
how
nice
it
is
here
in
this
garden
there
were
five
great
splashes
of
perfumed
brightness
upon
the
of
the
flowers
which
were
carefully
tended
and
constantly
renewed
for
the
gardener
had
a
customer
who
paid
liberally
halting
at
a
bench
in
front
of
a
bed
of
heliotrope
let
us
sit
here
for
a
while
she
said
i
have
something
funny
to
tell
you
she
proceeded
to
relate
a
bit
of
scandal
that
was
quite
fresh
and
from
the
effect
of
which
she
had
not
yet
recovered
the
story
was
that
mme
massival
the
whom
the
artist
had
married
had
come
to
mme
de
bratiane
furious
with
jealousy
right
in
the
midst
of
an
entertainment
in
which
the
marquise
was
singing
to
the
accompaniment
and
had
made
a
frightful
scene
results
rage
of
the
fair
italian
astonishment
and
laughter
of
the
guests
massival
quite
beside
himself
tried
to
take
away
his
wife
who
kept
striking
him
in
the
face
pulling
his
hair
and
beard
biting
him
and
tearing
his
clothes
but
she
clung
to
him
with
all
her
strength
and
held
him
so
that
he
could
not
stir
while
lamarthe
and
two
servants
who
had
hurried
to
them
at
the
noise
did
what
they
could
to
release
him
from
the
teeth
and
claws
of
this
fury
tranquillity
was
not
restored
until
after
the
pair
had
taken
their
departure
since
then
the
musician
had
remained
invisible
and
the
novelist
witness
of
the
scene
had
been
repeating
it
everywhere
in
a
very
witty
and
amusing
manner
the
affair
had
produced
a
deep
impression
upon
mme
de
burne
it
preoccupied
her
thoughts
to
such
an
extent
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
the
constant
recurrence
of
the
names
of
massival
and
lamarthe
upon
her
lips
annoyed
mariolle
you
just
heard
of
this
he
said
yes
hardly
an
hour
ago
and
that
is
the
reason
why
she
was
late
he
said
to
himself
with
bitterness
then
he
asked
aloud
shall
we
go
in
yes
she
absently
murmured
when
an
hour
later
she
had
left
him
for
she
was
greatly
hurried
that
day
he
returned
alone
to
the
quiet
little
house
and
seated
himself
on
a
low
chair
in
their
apartment
the
feeling
that
she
had
been
no
more
his
than
if
she
had
not
come
there
left
a
sort
of
black
cavern
in
his
heart
in
all
his
being
that
he
tried
to
probe
to
the
bottom
he
could
see
nothing
there
he
could
not
understand
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
understanding
if
she
had
not
abstracted
herself
from
his
kisses
she
had
at
all
events
escaped
from
the
immaterial
embraces
of
his
tenderness
by
a
mysterious
absence
of
the
will
of
being
his
she
had
not
refused
herself
to
him
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
not
brought
her
heart
there
with
her
it
had
remained
somewhere
else
very
far
away
idly
occupied
distracted
by
some
trifle
then
he
saw
that
he
already
loved
her
with
his
senses
as
much
as
with
his
feelings
even
more
perhaps
the
deprivation
of
her
soulless
caresses
inspired
him
with
a
mad
desire
to
run
after
her
and
bring
her
back
to
again
possess
himself
of
her
but
why
what
was
the
use
since
the
thoughts
of
that
fickle
mind
were
occupied
elsewhere
that
day
so
he
must
await
the
days
and
the
hours
when
to
this
elusive
mistress
of
his
there
should
come
the
caprice
like
her
other
caprices
of
being
in
love
with
him
he
returned
wearily
to
his
house
with
heavy
footsteps
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sidewalk
tired
of
life
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
made
no
appointment
with
her
for
the
future
either
at
her
house
or
elsewhere
chapter
viii
new
hopes
until
the
setting
in
of
winter
she
was
pretty
faithful
to
their
appointments
faithful
but
not
punctual
during
the
first
three
months
her
tardiness
on
these
occasions
ranged
between
of
an
hour
and
two
hours
as
the
autumnal
rains
compelled
mariolle
to
await
her
behind
the
garden
gate
with
an
umbrella
over
his
head
shivering
with
his
feet
in
the
mud
he
caused
a
sort
of
little
to
be
built
a
covered
and
inclosed
vestibule
behind
the
gate
so
that
he
might
not
take
cold
every
time
they
met
the
trees
had
lost
their
verdure
and
in
the
place
of
the
roses
and
other
flowers
the
beds
were
now
filled
with
great
masses
of
white
pink
violet
purple
and
yellow
chrysanthemums
exhaling
their
penetrating
balsamic
perfume
the
saddening
perfume
by
which
these
noble
flowers
remind
us
of
the
dying
year
upon
the
moist
atmosphere
heavy
with
the
odor
of
the
rain
upon
the
decaying
leaves
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
little
house
the
inventive
genius
of
the
gardener
had
devised
a
great
maltese
cross
composed
of
rarer
plants
arranged
in
delicate
combinations
of
color
and
mariolle
could
never
pass
this
bed
bright
with
new
and
constantly
changing
varieties
without
the
melancholy
reflection
that
this
flowery
cross
was
very
like
a
grave
he
was
well
acquainted
now
with
those
long
watches
in
the
little
behind
the
gate
the
rain
would
fall
sullenly
upon
the
thatch
with
which
he
had
had
it
roofed
and
trickle
down
the
board
siding
and
while
waiting
in
this
he
would
give
way
to
the
same
unvarying
reflections
go
through
the
same
process
of
reasoning
be
swayed
in
turn
by
the
same
hopes
the
same
fears
the
same
discouragements
it
was
an
incessant
battle
that
he
had
to
fight
a
fierce
exhausting
mental
struggle
with
an
elusive
force
a
force
that
perhaps
had
no
real
existence
the
tenderness
of
that
heart
what
strange
things
they
were
those
interviews
of
theirs
sometimes
she
would
come
in
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
full
to
overflowing
with
the
desire
of
conversation
and
would
take
a
seat
without
removing
her
hat
and
gloves
without
raising
her
veil
often
without
so
much
as
giving
him
a
kiss
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
kiss
him
on
such
occasions
her
head
was
full
of
a
host
of
captivating
little
preoccupations
each
of
them
more
captivating
to
her
than
the
idea
of
putting
up
her
lips
to
the
kiss
of
her
despairing
lover
he
would
take
a
seat
beside
her
heart
and
mouth
overrunning
with
burning
words
which
could
find
no
way
of
utterance
he
would
listen
to
her
and
answer
and
while
apparently
deeply
interested
in
what
she
was
saying
would
furtively
take
her
hand
which
she
would
yield
to
him
calmly
amicably
without
an
extra
pulsation
in
her
veins
at
other
times
she
would
appear
more
tender
more
wholly
his
but
he
who
was
watching
her
with
anxious
and
eyes
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
powerless
to
achieve
her
entire
conquest
could
see
and
divine
that
this
relative
degree
of
affection
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
nothing
had
occurred
on
such
occasions
of
sufficient
importance
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
him
her
persistent
unpunctuality
moreover
proved
to
mariolle
with
how
little
eagerness
she
looked
forward
to
these
interviews
when
we
love
when
anything
pleases
and
attracts
us
we
hasten
to
the
anticipated
meeting
but
once
the
charm
has
ceased
to
work
the
appointed
time
seems
to
come
too
quickly
and
everything
serves
as
a
pretext
to
delay
our
loitering
steps
and
put
off
the
moment
that
has
become
indefinably
distasteful
to
us
an
odd
comparison
with
a
habit
of
his
own
kept
incessantly
returning
to
his
mind
in
the
anticipation
of
his
morning
bath
always
made
him
hasten
his
toilette
and
his
visit
to
the
bathing
establishment
while
in
the
frosty
days
of
winter
he
always
found
so
many
little
things
to
attend
to
at
home
before
going
out
that
he
was
invariably
an
hour
behind
his
usual
time
the
meetings
at
auteuil
were
to
her
like
so
many
winter
for
some
time
past
moreover
she
had
been
making
these
interviews
more
infrequent
sending
telegrams
at
the
last
hour
putting
them
off
until
the
following
day
and
apparently
seeking
for
excuses
for
dispensing
with
them
she
always
succeeded
in
discovering
excuses
of
a
nature
to
satisfy
herself
but
they
caused
him
mental
and
physical
worries
and
anxieties
that
were
intolerable
if
she
had
manifested
any
coolness
if
she
had
shown
that
she
was
tiring
of
this
passion
of
his
that
she
felt
and
knew
was
constantly
increasing
in
violence
he
might
at
first
have
been
irritated
and
then
in
turn
offended
discouraged
and
resigned
but
on
the
contrary
she
manifested
more
affection
for
him
than
ever
she
seemed
more
flattered
by
his
love
more
desirous
of
retaining
it
while
not
responding
to
it
otherwise
than
by
friendly
marks
of
preference
which
were
beginning
to
make
all
her
other
admirers
jealous
she
could
never
see
enough
of
him
in
her
own
house
and
the
same
telegram
that
would
announce
to
andré
that
she
could
not
come
to
auteuil
would
convey
to
him
her
urgent
request
to
dine
with
her
or
come
and
spend
an
hour
in
the
evening
at
first
he
had
taken
these
invitations
as
her
way
of
making
amends
to
him
but
afterward
he
came
to
understand
that
she
liked
to
have
him
near
her
and
that
she
really
experienced
the
need
of
him
more
so
than
of
the
others
she
had
need
of
him
as
an
idol
needs
prayers
and
faith
in
order
to
make
it
a
god
standing
in
the
empty
shrine
it
is
but
a
bit
of
carved
wood
but
let
a
believer
enter
the
sanctuary
and
kneel
and
prostrate
himself
and
worship
with
fervent
prayers
drunk
with
religion
it
becomes
the
equal
of
brahma
or
of
allah
for
every
loved
being
is
a
kind
of
god
mme
de
burne
felt
that
she
was
adapted
beyond
all
others
to
play
this
rôle
of
fetich
to
fill
woman
mission
bestowed
on
her
by
nature
of
being
sought
after
and
adored
and
of
vanquishing
men
by
the
arms
of
her
beauty
grace
and
coquetry
in
the
meantime
she
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
affection
and
her
strong
liking
for
mariolle
careless
of
what
folks
might
say
about
it
possibly
with
the
secret
desire
of
irritating
and
inflaming
the
others
they
could
hardly
ever
come
to
her
house
without
finding
him
there
generally
installed
in
the
great
that
lamarthe
had
come
to
call
the
pulpit
of
the
officiating
priest
and
it
afforded
her
sincere
pleasure
to
remain
alone
in
his
company
for
an
entire
evening
talking
and
listening
to
him
she
had
taken
a
liking
to
this
kind
of
family
life
that
he
had
revealed
to
her
to
this
constant
contact
with
an
agreeable
mind
which
was
hers
and
at
her
command
just
as
much
as
were
the
little
trinkets
that
littered
her
in
like
manner
she
gradually
came
to
yield
to
him
much
of
herself
of
her
thoughts
of
her
deeper
mental
personality
in
the
course
of
those
affectionate
confidences
that
are
as
pleasant
in
the
giving
as
in
the
receiving
she
felt
herself
more
at
ease
more
frank
and
familiar
with
him
than
with
the
others
and
she
loved
him
the
more
for
it
she
also
experienced
the
sensation
dear
to
womankind
that
she
was
really
bestowing
something
that
she
was
confiding
to
some
one
all
that
she
had
to
give
a
thing
that
she
had
never
done
before
in
her
eyes
this
was
much
in
his
it
was
very
little
he
was
still
waiting
and
hoping
for
the
great
final
breaking
up
of
her
being
which
should
give
him
her
soul
beneath
his
caresses
caresses
she
seemed
to
regard
as
useless
annoying
rather
a
nuisance
than
otherwise
she
submitted
to
them
not
without
returning
them
but
tired
of
them
quickly
and
this
feeling
doubtless
engendered
in
her
a
shade
of
dislike
to
them
the
slightest
and
most
insignificant
of
them
seemed
to
be
irksome
to
her
when
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
would
take
her
hand
and
carry
it
to
his
lips
and
hold
it
there
a
little
she
always
seemed
desirous
of
withdrawing
it
and
he
could
feel
the
movement
of
the
muscles
in
her
arm
preparatory
to
taking
it
away
he
felt
these
things
like
so
many
thrusts
of
a
knife
and
he
carried
away
from
her
presence
wounds
that
bled
unintermittently
in
the
solitude
of
his
love
how
was
it
that
she
had
not
that
period
of
unreasoning
attraction
toward
him
that
almost
every
woman
has
when
once
she
has
made
the
entire
surrender
of
her
being
it
may
be
of
short
duration
frequently
it
is
followed
quickly
by
weariness
and
disgust
but
it
is
seldom
that
it
is
not
there
at
all
for
a
day
for
an
hour
this
mistress
of
his
had
made
of
him
not
a
lover
but
a
sort
of
intelligent
companion
of
her
life
of
what
was
he
complaining
those
who
yield
themselves
entirely
perhaps
have
less
to
give
than
she
he
was
not
complaining
he
was
afraid
he
was
afraid
of
that
other
one
the
man
who
would
spring
up
unexpectedly
whenever
she
might
chance
to
fall
in
with
him
may
be
or
the
day
after
whoever
he
might
be
artist
actor
soldier
or
man
of
the
world
it
mattered
not
what
born
to
find
favor
in
her
woman
eyes
and
securing
her
favor
for
no
other
reason
because
he
was
the
one
destined
to
implant
in
her
for
the
first
time
the
imperious
desire
of
opening
her
arms
to
him
he
was
now
jealous
of
the
future
as
before
he
had
at
times
been
jealous
of
her
unknown
past
and
all
the
young
woman
intimates
were
beginning
to
be
jealous
of
him
he
was
the
subject
of
much
conversation
among
them
they
even
made
dark
and
mysterious
allusions
to
the
subject
in
her
presence
some
said
that
he
was
her
lover
while
others
guided
by
lamarthe
opinion
decided
that
she
was
only
making
a
fool
of
him
in
order
to
irritate
and
exasperate
them
as
it
was
her
habit
to
do
and
that
this
was
all
there
was
to
it
her
father
took
the
matter
up
and
made
some
remarks
to
her
which
she
did
not
receive
with
good
grace
and
the
more
conscious
she
became
of
the
reports
that
were
circulating
among
her
acquaintance
the
more
by
an
odd
contradiction
to
the
prudence
that
had
ruled
her
life
did
she
persist
in
making
an
open
display
of
the
preference
that
she
felt
for
mariolle
he
however
was
somewhat
disturbed
by
these
suspicious
mutterings
he
spoke
to
her
of
it
what
do
i
care
she
said
if
you
only
loved
me
as
a
lover
do
i
not
love
you
my
friend
yes
and
no
you
love
me
well
enough
in
your
own
house
but
very
badly
elsewhere
i
should
prefer
it
to
be
just
the
opposite
for
my
sake
and
even
indeed
for
your
own
she
laughed
and
murmured
we
ca
do
more
than
we
can
if
you
only
knew
the
mental
trouble
that
i
experience
in
trying
to
animate
your
love
at
times
i
seem
to
be
trying
to
grasp
the
intangible
to
be
clasping
an
iceberg
in
my
arms
that
chills
me
and
melts
away
within
my
embrace
she
made
no
answer
not
fancying
the
subject
and
assumed
the
absent
manner
that
she
often
wore
at
auteuil
he
did
not
venture
to
press
the
matter
further
he
looked
upon
her
a
good
deal
as
amateurs
look
upon
the
precious
objects
in
a
museum
that
tempt
them
so
strongly
and
that
they
know
they
can
not
carry
away
with
them
his
days
and
nights
were
made
up
of
hours
of
suffering
for
he
was
living
in
the
fixed
idea
and
still
more
in
the
sentiment
than
in
the
idea
that
she
was
his
and
yet
not
his
that
she
was
conquered
and
still
at
liberty
captured
and
yet
impregnable
he
was
living
at
her
side
as
near
her
as
could
be
without
ever
reaching
her
and
he
loved
her
with
all
the
unsatiated
longings
of
his
body
and
his
soul
he
began
to
write
to
her
again
as
he
had
done
at
the
commencement
of
their
once
before
with
ink
he
had
vanquished
her
early
scruples
once
again
with
ink
he
might
be
victorious
over
this
later
and
obstinate
resistance
putting
longer
intervals
between
his
visits
to
her
he
told
her
in
almost
daily
letters
of
the
fruitlessness
of
his
love
now
and
then
when
he
had
been
very
eloquent
and
impassioned
and
had
evinced
great
sorrow
she
answered
him
her
letters
dated
for
effect
midnight
or
one
two
or
three
in
the
morning
were
clear
and
precise
well
considered
encouraging
and
afflicting
she
reasoned
well
and
they
were
not
destitute
of
wit
and
even
fancy
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
read
them
and
them
it
was
in
vain
that
he
admitted
that
they
were
to
the
point
well
turned
intelligent
graceful
and
satisfactory
to
his
masculine
vanity
they
had
in
them
nothing
of
her
heart
they
satisfied
him
no
more
than
did
the
kisses
that
she
gave
him
in
the
house
at
auteuil
he
asked
himself
why
this
was
so
and
when
he
had
learned
them
by
heart
he
came
to
know
them
so
well
that
he
discovered
the
reason
for
a
person
writings
always
afford
the
surest
clue
to
his
nature
spoken
words
dazzle
and
deceive
for
lips
are
pleasing
and
eyes
seductive
but
black
characters
set
down
upon
white
paper
expose
the
soul
in
all
its
nakedness
man
thanks
to
the
artifices
of
rhetoric
to
his
professional
address
and
his
habit
of
using
the
pen
to
discuss
all
the
affairs
of
life
often
succeeds
in
disguising
his
own
nature
by
his
impersonal
prose
style
literary
or
business
but
woman
never
writes
unless
it
is
of
herself
and
something
of
her
being
goes
into
her
every
word
she
knows
nothing
of
the
subtilities
of
style
and
surrenders
herself
unreservedly
in
her
ignorance
of
the
scope
and
value
of
words
mariolle
called
to
mind
the
memoirs
and
correspondence
of
celebrated
women
that
he
had
read
how
distinctly
their
characters
were
all
set
forth
there
the
the
witty
and
the
sensible
what
struck
him
most
in
mme
de
burne
letters
was
that
no
trace
of
sensibility
was
to
be
discovered
in
them
this
woman
had
the
faculty
of
thought
but
not
of
feeling
he
called
to
mind
letters
that
he
had
received
from
other
persons
he
had
had
many
of
them
a
little
that
he
had
met
while
traveling
and
who
had
loved
him
for
the
space
of
three
months
had
written
delicious
thrilling
notes
abounding
in
fresh
and
unexpected
terms
of
sentiment
he
had
been
surprised
by
the
flexibility
the
elegant
coloring
and
the
variety
of
her
style
whence
had
she
obtained
this
gift
from
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
of
sensibility
there
could
be
no
other
answer
a
woman
does
not
elaborate
her
phrases
they
come
to
her
intelligence
straight
from
her
emotions
she
does
not
rummage
the
dictionary
for
fine
words
what
she
feels
strongly
she
expresses
justly
without
long
and
labored
consideration
in
the
adaptive
sincerity
of
her
nature
he
tried
to
test
the
sincerity
of
his
mistress
nature
by
means
of
the
lines
which
she
wrote
him
they
were
well
written
and
full
of
amiability
but
how
was
it
that
she
could
find
nothing
better
for
him
ah
for
her
had
found
words
that
burned
as
living
coals
when
his
valet
brought
in
his
mail
he
would
look
for
an
envelope
bearing
the
handwriting
and
when
he
recognized
it
an
involuntary
emotion
would
arise
in
him
succeeded
by
a
beating
of
the
heart
he
would
extend
his
hand
and
grasp
the
bit
of
paper
again
he
would
scrutinize
the
address
then
tear
it
open
what
had
she
to
say
to
him
would
he
find
the
word
love
there
she
had
never
written
or
uttered
this
word
without
qualifying
it
by
the
adverb
well
i
love
you
well
i
love
you
much
do
i
not
love
you
he
knew
all
these
formulas
which
are
inexpressive
by
reason
of
what
is
tacked
on
to
them
can
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
comparison
between
the
degrees
of
love
when
one
is
in
its
toils
can
one
decide
whether
he
loves
well
or
ill
to
love
much
what
a
dearth
of
love
that
expression
manifests
one
loves
nothing
more
nothing
less
nothing
can
be
said
nothing
expressed
nothing
imagined
that
means
more
than
that
one
simple
sentence
it
is
brief
it
is
everything
it
becomes
body
soul
life
the
whole
of
our
being
we
feel
it
as
we
feel
the
warm
blood
in
our
veins
we
inhale
it
as
we
do
the
air
we
carry
it
within
us
as
we
carry
our
thoughts
for
it
becomes
the
atmosphere
of
the
mind
nothing
has
existence
beside
it
it
is
not
a
word
it
is
an
inexpressible
state
of
being
represented
by
a
few
letters
all
the
conditions
of
life
are
changed
by
it
whatever
we
do
there
is
nothing
done
or
seen
or
tasted
or
enjoyed
or
suffered
just
as
it
was
before
mariolle
had
become
the
victim
of
this
small
verb
and
his
eye
would
run
rapidly
over
the
lines
seeking
there
a
tenderness
answering
to
his
own
he
did
in
fact
find
there
sufficient
to
warrant
him
in
saying
to
himself
she
loves
me
very
well
but
never
to
make
him
exclaim
she
loves
me
she
was
continuing
in
her
correspondence
the
pretty
poetical
romance
that
had
had
its
inception
at
mont
it
was
the
literature
of
love
not
of
love
when
he
had
finished
reading
and
them
he
would
lock
the
precious
and
disappointing
sheets
in
a
drawer
and
seat
himself
in
his
he
had
passed
many
a
bitter
hour
in
it
before
this
after
a
while
her
answers
to
his
letters
became
less
frequent
doubtless
she
was
somewhat
weary
of
manufacturing
phrases
and
ringing
the
changes
on
the
same
stale
theme
and
then
besides
she
was
passing
through
a
period
of
unwonted
fashionable
excitement
of
which
andré
had
presaged
the
approach
with
that
increment
of
suffering
that
such
insignificant
disagreeable
incidents
can
bring
to
troubled
hearts
it
was
a
winter
of
great
gaiety
a
mad
intoxication
had
taken
possession
of
paris
and
shaken
the
city
to
its
depths
all
night
long
cabs
and
were
rolling
through
the
streets
and
through
the
windows
were
visible
white
apparitions
of
women
in
evening
toilette
everyone
was
having
a
good
time
all
the
conversation
was
on
plays
and
balls
matinées
and
soirées
the
contagion
an
epidemic
of
pleasure
as
it
were
had
quickly
extended
to
all
classes
of
society
and
mme
de
burne
also
was
attacked
by
it
it
had
all
been
brought
about
by
the
effect
that
her
beauty
had
produced
at
a
dance
at
the
austrian
embassy
the
comte
de
bernhaus
had
made
her
acquainted
with
the
ambassadress
the
princess
de
malten
who
had
been
immediately
and
entirely
delighted
with
mme
de
burne
within
a
very
short
time
she
became
the
princess
very
intimate
friend
and
thereby
extended
with
great
rapidity
her
relations
among
the
most
select
diplomatic
and
aristocratic
circles
her
grace
her
elegance
her
charming
manners
her
intelligence
and
wit
quickly
achieved
a
triumph
for
her
and
made
her
and
many
of
the
highest
titles
among
the
women
of
france
sought
to
be
presented
to
her
every
monday
would
witness
a
long
line
of
with
arms
on
their
panels
drawn
up
along
the
curb
of
the
rue
du
and
the
footmen
would
lose
their
heads
and
make
sad
havoc
with
the
names
that
they
bellowed
into
the
confounding
duchesses
with
marquises
countesses
with
baronnes
she
was
entirely
carried
off
her
feet
the
incense
of
compliments
and
invitations
the
feeling
that
she
was
become
one
of
the
elect
to
whom
paris
bends
the
knee
in
worship
as
long
as
the
fancy
lasts
the
delight
of
being
thus
admired
made
much
of
and
run
after
were
too
much
for
her
and
gave
rise
within
her
soul
to
an
acute
attack
of
snobbishness
her
artistic
following
did
not
submit
to
this
condition
of
affairs
without
a
struggle
and
the
revolution
produced
a
close
alliance
among
her
old
friends
fresnel
even
was
accepted
by
them
enrolled
on
the
regimental
muster
and
became
a
power
in
the
league
while
mariolle
was
its
acknowledged
head
for
they
were
all
aware
of
the
ascendency
that
he
had
over
her
and
her
friendship
for
him
he
however
watched
her
as
she
was
whirled
away
in
this
flattering
popularity
as
a
child
watches
the
vanishing
of
his
red
balloon
when
he
has
let
go
the
string
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
eluding
him
in
the
midst
of
this
elegant
motley
dancing
throng
and
flying
far
far
away
from
that
secret
happiness
that
he
had
so
ardently
desired
for
both
of
them
and
he
was
jealous
of
everybody
and
everything
men
women
and
inanimate
objects
alike
he
conceived
a
fierce
detestation
for
the
life
that
she
was
leading
for
all
the
people
that
she
associated
with
all
the
that
she
frequented
balls
theaters
music
for
they
were
all
in
a
league
to
take
her
from
him
by
bits
and
absorb
her
days
and
nights
and
only
a
few
scant
hours
were
now
accorded
to
their
intimacy
his
indulgence
of
this
unreasoning
spite
came
near
causing
him
a
fit
of
sickness
and
when
he
visited
her
he
brought
with
him
such
a
wan
face
that
she
said
to
him
what
ails
you
you
have
changed
of
late
and
are
very
thin
i
have
been
loving
you
too
much
he
replied
she
gave
him
a
grateful
look
no
one
ever
loves
too
much
my
friend
can
you
say
such
a
thing
as
that
why
yes
and
you
do
not
see
that
i
am
dying
of
my
vain
love
for
you
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
true
that
you
love
in
vain
then
no
one
ever
dies
of
that
complaint
and
finally
all
our
friends
are
jealous
of
you
which
proves
pretty
conclusively
that
i
am
not
treating
you
badly
all
things
considered
he
took
her
hand
you
do
not
understand
me
yes
i
understand
very
well
you
hear
the
despairing
appeal
that
i
am
incessantly
making
to
your
heart
yes
i
have
heard
it
and
and
it
gives
me
much
pain
for
i
love
you
enormously
and
then
then
you
say
to
me
like
me
think
feel
express
yourself
as
i
do
but
my
poor
friend
i
ca
i
am
what
i
am
you
must
take
me
as
god
made
me
since
i
gave
myself
thus
to
you
since
i
have
no
regrets
for
having
done
so
and
no
desire
to
withdraw
from
the
bargain
since
there
is
no
one
among
all
my
acquaintance
that
is
dearer
to
me
than
you
are
you
do
not
love
me
i
love
you
with
all
the
power
of
loving
that
exists
in
me
if
it
is
not
different
or
greater
is
that
my
fault
if
i
was
certain
of
that
i
might
content
myself
with
it
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
i
believe
you
capable
of
loving
otherwise
but
that
i
do
not
believe
that
it
lies
in
me
to
inspire
you
with
a
genuine
passion
my
friend
you
are
mistaken
you
are
more
to
me
than
anyone
has
ever
been
hitherto
more
than
anyone
will
ever
be
in
the
future
at
least
that
is
my
honest
conviction
i
may
lay
claim
to
this
great
merit
that
i
do
not
wear
two
faces
with
you
i
do
not
feign
to
be
what
you
so
ardently
desire
me
to
be
when
many
women
would
act
quite
differently
be
a
little
grateful
to
me
for
this
and
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
agitated
and
unstrung
trust
in
my
affection
which
is
yours
sincerely
and
unreservedly
he
saw
how
wide
the
difference
was
that
parted
them
ah
he
murmured
how
strangely
you
look
at
love
and
speak
of
it
to
you
i
am
some
one
that
you
like
to
see
now
and
then
whom
you
like
to
have
beside
you
but
to
me
you
fill
the
universe
in
it
i
know
but
you
feel
but
you
need
but
you
she
smiled
with
satisfaction
and
replied
i
know
that
i
understand
i
am
delighted
to
have
it
so
and
i
say
to
you
love
me
always
like
that
if
you
can
for
it
gives
me
great
happiness
but
do
not
force
me
to
act
a
part
before
you
that
would
be
distressing
to
me
and
unworthy
of
us
both
i
have
been
aware
for
some
time
of
the
approach
of
this
crisis
it
is
the
cause
of
much
suffering
to
me
for
i
am
deeply
attached
to
you
but
i
can
not
bend
my
nature
or
shape
it
in
conformity
with
yours
take
me
as
i
am
suddenly
he
asked
her
have
you
ever
thought
have
you
ever
believed
if
only
for
a
day
only
for
an
hour
either
before
or
after
that
you
might
be
able
to
love
me
otherwise
she
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
and
reflected
for
a
few
seconds
he
waited
anxiously
for
her
to
speak
and
continued
you
see
do
you
that
you
have
had
other
dreams
as
well
i
may
have
been
momentarily
deceived
in
myself
she
murmured
thoughtfully
oh
how
ingenious
you
are
he
exclaimed
how
psychological
no
one
ever
reasons
thus
from
the
impulse
of
the
heart
she
was
reflecting
still
interested
in
her
thoughts
in
this
finally
she
said
before
i
came
to
love
you
as
i
love
you
now
i
may
indeed
have
thought
that
i
might
come
to
be
more
more
more
captivated
with
you
but
then
i
certainly
should
not
have
been
so
frank
and
simple
with
you
perhaps
later
on
i
should
have
been
less
sincere
why
less
sincere
later
on
because
all
of
love
according
to
your
idea
lies
in
this
formula
or
nothing
and
this
or
nothing
as
far
as
i
can
see
means
at
first
nothing
afterward
it
is
when
the
reign
of
nothing
commences
that
women
begin
to
be
deceitful
he
replied
in
great
distress
but
you
do
not
see
how
wretched
i
am
how
i
am
tortured
by
the
thought
that
you
might
have
loved
me
otherwise
you
have
felt
that
thought
therefore
it
is
some
other
one
that
you
will
love
in
that
manner
she
unhesitatingly
replied
i
do
not
believe
it
and
why
yes
why
i
ask
you
since
you
have
had
the
foreknowledge
of
love
since
you
have
felt
in
anticipation
the
fleeting
and
torturing
hope
of
confounding
soul
and
body
with
the
soul
and
body
of
another
of
losing
your
being
in
his
and
taking
his
being
to
be
portion
of
your
own
since
you
have
perceived
the
possibility
of
this
ineffable
emotion
the
day
will
come
sooner
or
later
when
you
will
experience
it
no
my
imagination
deceived
me
and
deceived
itself
i
am
giving
you
all
that
i
have
to
give
you
i
have
reflected
deeply
on
this
subject
since
i
have
been
your
mistress
observe
that
i
do
not
mince
matters
not
even
my
words
really
and
truly
i
am
convinced
that
i
can
not
love
you
more
or
better
than
i
do
at
this
moment
you
see
that
i
talk
to
you
just
as
i
talk
to
myself
i
do
that
because
you
are
very
intelligent
because
you
understand
and
can
read
me
like
a
book
and
the
best
way
is
to
conceal
nothing
from
you
it
is
the
only
way
to
keep
us
long
and
closely
united
and
that
is
what
i
hope
for
my
friend
he
listened
to
her
as
a
man
drinks
when
he
is
thirsty
then
kneeled
before
her
and
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
he
took
her
little
hands
and
pressed
them
to
his
lips
murmuring
thanks
thanks
when
he
raised
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
he
saw
that
there
were
tears
standing
in
hers
then
placing
her
arms
in
turn
about
andré
neck
she
gently
drew
him
toward
her
bent
over
and
kissed
him
upon
the
eyelids
take
a
chair
she
said
it
is
not
prudent
to
be
kneeling
before
me
here
he
seated
himself
and
when
they
had
contemplated
each
other
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
she
asked
him
if
he
would
take
her
some
day
to
visit
the
exhibition
that
the
sculptor
prédolé
of
whom
everyone
was
talking
enthusiastically
was
then
giving
of
his
works
she
had
in
her
a
bronze
love
of
his
a
charming
figure
pouring
water
into
her
and
she
had
a
great
desire
to
see
the
complete
collection
of
the
eminent
artist
works
which
had
been
delighting
all
paris
for
a
week
past
at
the
varin
gallery
they
fixed
upon
a
date
and
then
mariolle
arose
to
take
leave
will
you
be
at
auteuil
she
asked
him
in
a
whisper
oh
yes
he
was
very
joyful
on
his
way
homeward
intoxicated
by
that
perhaps
which
never
dies
in
the
heart
of
a
lover
chapter
ix
disillusion
mme
de
burne
was
proceeding
at
a
quick
trot
along
the
rue
de
grenelle
it
was
early
april
and
the
hailstones
of
a
belated
storm
beat
noisily
against
the
glasses
of
the
carriage
and
rattled
off
upon
the
roadway
which
was
already
whitened
by
the
falling
particles
men
on
foot
were
hurrying
along
the
sidewalk
beneath
their
umbrellas
with
turned
up
to
protect
their
necks
and
ears
after
two
weeks
of
fine
weather
a
detestable
cold
spell
had
set
in
the
farewell
of
winter
freezing
up
everything
and
bringing
chapped
hands
and
chilblains
with
her
feet
resting
upon
a
vessel
filled
with
hot
water
and
her
form
enveloped
in
soft
furs
that
warmed
her
through
her
dress
with
a
velvety
caress
that
was
so
deliciously
agreeable
to
her
sensitive
skin
the
young
woman
was
sadly
reflecting
that
in
an
hour
at
farthest
she
would
have
to
take
a
cab
to
go
and
meet
mariolle
at
auteuil
she
was
seized
by
a
strong
desire
to
send
him
a
telegram
but
she
had
promised
herself
more
than
two
months
ago
that
she
would
not
again
have
recourse
to
this
expedient
unless
compelled
to
for
she
had
been
making
a
great
effort
to
love
him
in
the
same
manner
that
he
loved
her
she
had
seen
how
he
suffered
and
had
commiserated
him
and
after
that
conversation
when
she
had
kissed
him
upon
the
eyes
in
an
outburst
of
genuine
tenderness
her
sincere
affection
for
him
had
in
fact
assumed
a
warmer
and
more
expansive
character
in
her
surprise
at
her
involuntary
coldness
she
had
asked
herself
why
after
all
she
could
not
love
him
as
other
women
love
their
lovers
since
she
knew
that
she
was
deeply
attached
to
him
and
that
he
was
more
pleasing
to
her
than
any
other
man
this
indifference
of
her
love
could
only
proceed
from
a
sluggish
action
of
the
heart
which
could
be
cured
like
any
other
sluggishness
she
tried
it
she
endeavored
to
arouse
her
feelings
by
thoughts
of
him
to
be
more
demonstrative
in
his
presence
she
was
successful
now
and
then
just
as
one
excites
his
fears
at
night
by
thinking
of
ghosts
or
robbers
fired
a
little
herself
by
this
pretense
of
passion
she
even
forced
herself
to
be
more
caressing
she
succeeded
very
well
at
first
and
delighted
him
to
the
point
of
intoxication
she
thought
that
this
was
the
beginning
in
her
of
a
fever
somewhat
similar
to
that
with
which
she
knew
that
he
was
consuming
her
old
intermittent
hopes
of
love
that
she
had
dimly
seen
the
possibility
of
realizing
the
night
that
she
had
dreamed
her
dreams
among
the
white
mists
of
bay
took
form
and
shape
again
not
so
seductive
as
then
less
wrapped
in
clouds
of
poetry
and
idealism
but
more
clearly
defined
more
human
stripped
of
illusion
after
the
experience
of
her
then
she
had
summoned
up
and
watched
for
that
irresistible
impulse
of
all
the
being
toward
another
being
that
arises
she
had
heard
when
the
emotions
of
the
soul
act
upon
two
physical
natures
she
had
watched
in
vain
it
had
never
come
she
persisted
however
in
feigning
ardor
in
making
their
interviews
more
frequent
in
saying
to
him
i
feel
that
i
am
coming
to
love
you
more
and
more
but
she
became
weary
of
it
at
last
and
was
powerless
longer
to
impose
upon
herself
or
deceive
him
she
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
kisses
that
he
gave
her
were
becoming
distasteful
to
her
after
a
while
although
she
was
not
by
any
means
entirely
insensible
to
them
this
was
made
manifest
to
her
by
the
vague
lassitude
that
took
possession
of
her
from
the
early
morning
of
those
days
when
she
had
an
appointment
with
him
why
was
it
that
on
those
mornings
she
did
not
feel
as
other
women
feel
all
her
nature
troubled
by
the
desire
and
anticipation
of
his
embraces
she
endured
them
indeed
she
accepted
them
with
tender
resignation
but
as
a
woman
conquered
brutally
subjugated
responding
contrary
to
her
own
will
never
voluntarily
and
with
pleasure
could
it
be
that
her
nature
so
delicate
so
exceptionally
aristocratic
and
refined
had
in
it
depths
of
modesty
the
modesty
of
a
superior
and
sacred
animality
that
were
as
yet
unfathomed
by
modern
perceptions
mariolle
gradually
came
to
understand
this
he
saw
her
factitious
ardor
growing
less
and
less
he
divined
the
nature
of
her
attempt
and
a
mortal
inconsolable
sorrow
took
possession
of
his
soul
she
knew
now
as
he
knew
that
the
attempt
had
been
made
and
that
all
hope
was
gone
the
proof
of
this
was
that
this
very
day
wrapped
as
she
was
in
her
warm
furs
and
with
her
feet
on
her
bottle
glowing
with
a
feeling
of
physical
comfort
as
she
watched
the
hail
beating
against
the
windows
of
her
she
could
not
find
in
her
the
courage
to
leave
this
luxurious
warmth
to
get
into
an
cab
to
go
and
meet
the
poor
fellow
the
idea
of
breaking
with
him
of
avoiding
his
caresses
certainly
never
occurred
to
her
for
a
moment
she
was
well
aware
that
to
completely
captivate
a
man
who
is
in
love
and
keep
him
as
one
own
peculiar
private
property
in
the
midst
of
feminine
rivalries
a
woman
must
surrender
herself
to
him
body
and
soul
that
she
knew
for
it
is
logical
fated
indisputable
it
is
even
the
loyal
course
to
pursue
and
she
wanted
to
be
loyal
to
him
in
all
the
uprightness
of
her
nature
as
his
mistress
she
would
go
to
him
then
she
would
go
to
him
always
but
why
so
often
would
not
their
interviews
even
assume
a
greater
charm
for
him
an
attraction
of
novelty
if
they
were
granted
more
charily
like
rare
and
inestimable
gifts
presented
to
him
by
her
and
not
to
be
used
too
prodigally
whenever
she
had
gone
to
auteuil
she
had
had
the
impression
that
she
was
bearing
to
him
a
priceless
gift
the
most
precious
of
offerings
in
giving
in
this
way
the
pleasure
of
giving
is
inseparable
from
a
certain
sensation
of
sacrifice
it
is
the
pride
that
one
feels
in
being
generous
the
satisfaction
of
conferring
happiness
not
the
transports
of
a
mutual
passion
she
even
calculated
that
andré
love
would
be
more
likely
to
be
enduring
if
she
abated
somewhat
of
her
familiarity
with
him
for
hunger
always
increases
by
fasting
and
desire
is
but
an
appetite
immediately
that
this
resolution
was
formed
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
go
to
auteuil
that
day
but
would
feign
indisposition
the
journey
which
a
minute
ago
had
seemed
to
her
so
difficult
through
the
inclement
weather
now
appeared
to
her
quite
easy
and
she
understood
with
a
smile
at
her
own
expense
and
at
this
sudden
revelation
why
she
made
such
a
difficulty
about
a
thing
that
was
quite
natural
but
a
moment
ago
she
would
not
now
she
would
the
reason
why
she
would
not
a
moment
ago
was
that
she
was
anticipating
the
thousand
petty
disagreeable
details
of
the
rendezvous
she
would
prick
her
fingers
with
pins
that
she
handled
very
awkwardly
she
would
be
unable
to
find
the
articles
that
she
had
thrown
at
random
upon
the
bedroom
floor
as
she
disrobed
in
haste
already
looking
forward
to
the
hateful
task
of
having
to
dress
without
an
attendant
she
paused
at
this
reflection
dwelling
upon
it
and
weighing
it
carefully
for
the
first
time
after
all
was
it
not
rather
repugnant
rather
vulgarizing
this
idea
of
a
rendezvous
for
a
stated
time
settled
upon
a
day
or
two
days
in
advance
just
like
a
business
appointment
or
a
consultation
with
your
doctor
there
is
nothing
more
natural
after
a
long
and
charming
than
that
the
lips
which
have
been
uttering
warm
seductive
words
should
meet
in
a
passionate
kiss
but
how
different
that
was
from
the
premeditated
kiss
that
she
went
there
to
receive
watch
in
hand
once
a
week
there
was
so
much
truth
in
this
that
on
those
days
when
she
was
not
to
see
andré
she
had
frequently
felt
a
vague
desire
of
being
with
him
while
this
desire
was
scarcely
perceptible
at
all
when
she
had
to
go
to
him
in
foul
cabs
through
squalid
streets
with
the
cunning
of
a
hunted
thief
all
her
feelings
toward
him
quenched
and
deadened
by
these
considerations
ah
that
appointment
at
auteuil
she
had
calculated
the
time
on
all
the
clocks
of
all
her
friends
she
had
watched
the
minutes
that
brought
her
nearer
to
it
slip
away
at
mme
de
frémines
at
mme
de
bratiane
at
pretty
mme
le
prieur
on
those
afternoons
when
she
killed
time
by
roaming
about
paris
so
as
not
to
remain
in
her
own
house
where
she
might
be
detained
by
an
inopportune
visit
or
some
other
unforeseen
obstacle
she
suddenly
said
to
herself
i
will
make
a
day
of
rest
i
will
go
there
very
late
then
she
opened
a
little
cupboard
in
the
front
of
the
carriage
concealed
among
the
folds
of
black
silk
that
lined
the
which
was
fitted
up
as
luxuriously
as
a
pretty
woman
boudoir
the
first
thing
that
presented
itself
when
she
had
thrown
open
the
doors
of
this
secret
receptacle
was
a
mirror
playing
on
hinges
that
she
moved
so
that
it
was
on
a
level
with
her
face
behind
the
mirror
in
their
niches
were
various
small
objects
in
silver
a
box
for
her
a
pencil
for
her
lips
two
crystal
an
inkstand
and
penholder
scissors
a
pretty
to
tear
the
leaves
of
the
last
novel
with
which
she
amused
herself
as
she
rolled
along
the
streets
the
exquisite
clock
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
walnut
told
her
that
it
was
four
mme
de
burne
reflected
i
have
an
hour
yet
at
all
events
and
she
touched
a
spring
that
had
the
effect
of
making
the
footman
who
was
seated
beside
the
coachman
stoop
and
take
up
the
to
receive
her
order
she
pulled
out
the
other
end
from
where
it
was
concealed
in
the
lining
of
the
carriage
and
applying
her
lips
to
the
mouthpiece
of
to
the
austrian
embassy
she
said
then
she
inspected
herself
in
the
mirror
the
look
that
she
gave
herself
expressed
as
it
always
did
the
delight
that
one
feels
in
looking
upon
one
best
beloved
then
she
threw
back
her
furs
to
judge
of
the
effect
of
her
corsage
it
was
a
toilette
adapted
to
the
chill
days
of
the
end
of
winter
the
neck
was
trimmed
with
a
bordering
of
very
fine
white
down
that
shaded
off
into
a
delicate
gray
as
it
fell
over
the
shoulders
like
the
wing
of
a
bird
upon
her
hat
it
was
a
kind
of
toque
there
towered
an
aigret
of
more
brightly
colored
feathers
and
the
general
effect
that
her
costume
inspired
was
to
make
one
think
that
she
had
got
herself
up
in
this
manner
in
preparation
for
a
flight
through
the
hail
and
the
gray
sky
in
company
with
mother
carey
chickens
she
was
still
complacently
contemplating
herself
when
the
carriage
suddenly
wheeled
into
the
great
court
of
the
embassy
thereupon
she
arranged
her
wrap
lowered
the
mirror
to
its
place
closed
the
doors
of
the
little
cupboard
and
when
the
had
come
to
a
halt
said
to
her
coachman
you
may
go
home
i
shall
not
need
you
any
more
then
she
asked
the
footman
who
came
forward
from
the
entrance
of
the
hotel
is
the
princess
at
home
yes
madame
she
entered
and
ascended
the
stairs
and
came
to
a
small
where
the
princess
de
malten
was
writing
letters
the
ambassadress
arose
with
an
appearance
of
much
satisfaction
when
she
perceived
her
friend
and
they
kissed
each
other
twice
in
succession
upon
the
cheek
close
to
the
corner
of
the
lips
then
they
seated
themselves
side
by
side
upon
two
low
chairs
in
front
of
the
fire
they
were
very
fond
of
each
other
took
great
delight
in
each
society
and
understood
each
other
thoroughly
for
they
were
almost
counterparts
in
nature
and
disposition
belonging
to
the
same
race
of
femininity
brought
up
in
the
same
atmosphere
and
endowed
with
the
same
sensations
although
mme
de
malten
was
a
swede
and
had
married
an
austrian
they
had
a
strange
and
mysterious
attraction
for
each
other
from
which
resulted
a
profound
feeling
of
unmixed
and
contentment
whenever
they
were
together
their
babble
would
run
on
for
half
a
day
on
end
without
once
stopping
trivial
futile
talk
interesting
to
them
both
by
reason
of
their
similarity
of
tastes
you
see
how
i
love
you
said
mme
de
burne
you
are
to
dine
with
me
this
evening
and
still
i
could
not
help
coming
to
see
you
it
is
a
real
passion
my
dear
a
passion
that
i
share
the
swede
replied
with
a
smile
following
the
habit
of
their
profession
they
put
each
her
best
foot
foremost
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
coquettish
as
if
they
had
been
dealing
with
a
man
but
with
a
different
style
of
coquetry
for
the
strife
was
different
and
they
had
not
before
them
the
adversary
but
the
rival
madame
de
burne
had
kept
looking
at
the
clock
during
the
conversation
it
was
on
the
point
of
striking
five
he
had
been
waiting
there
an
hour
that
is
long
enough
she
said
to
herself
as
she
arose
so
soon
said
the
princess
yes
the
other
unblushingly
replied
i
am
in
a
hurry
there
is
some
one
waiting
for
me
i
would
a
great
deal
rather
stay
here
with
you
they
exchanged
kisses
again
and
mme
de
burne
having
requested
the
footman
to
call
a
cab
for
her
drove
away
the
horse
was
lame
and
dragged
the
cab
after
him
wearily
and
the
animal
halting
and
fatigue
seemed
to
have
infected
the
young
woman
like
the
beast
she
found
the
journey
long
and
difficult
at
one
moment
she
was
comforted
by
the
pleasure
of
seeing
andré
at
the
next
she
was
in
despair
at
the
thought
of
the
discomforts
of
the
interview
she
found
him
waiting
for
her
behind
the
gate
shivering
the
biting
blasts
roared
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
hailstones
rattled
on
their
umbrella
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
house
their
feet
sank
deep
into
the
mud
the
garden
was
dead
dismal
miry
melancholy
and
andré
was
very
pale
he
was
enduring
terrible
suffering
when
they
were
in
the
house
gracious
how
cold
it
is
she
exclaimed
and
yet
a
great
fire
was
blazing
in
each
of
the
two
rooms
but
they
had
not
been
lighted
until
past
noon
and
had
not
had
time
to
dry
the
damp
walls
and
shivers
ran
through
her
frame
i
think
that
i
will
not
take
off
my
furs
just
yet
she
added
she
only
unbuttoned
her
outer
garment
and
threw
it
open
disclosing
her
warm
costume
and
her
corsage
like
a
bird
of
passage
that
never
remains
long
in
one
place
he
seated
himself
beside
her
there
is
to
be
a
delightful
dinner
at
my
house
she
said
and
i
am
enjoying
it
in
anticipation
who
are
to
be
there
why
you
in
the
first
place
then
prédolé
whom
i
have
so
long
wanted
to
know
ah
prédolé
is
to
be
there
yes
lamarthe
is
to
bring
him
but
prédolé
is
not
the
kind
of
a
man
to
suit
you
not
a
bit
sculptors
in
general
are
not
so
constituted
as
to
please
pretty
women
and
prédolé
less
so
than
any
of
them
oh
my
friend
that
can
not
be
i
have
such
an
admiration
for
him
the
sculptor
prédolé
had
gained
a
great
success
and
had
captivated
all
paris
some
two
months
before
by
his
exhibition
at
the
varin
gallery
even
before
that
he
had
been
highly
appreciated
people
had
said
of
him
his
are
delicious
but
when
the
world
of
artists
and
connoisseurs
had
assembled
to
pass
judgment
upon
his
collected
works
in
the
rooms
of
the
rue
varin
the
outburst
of
enthusiasm
had
been
explosive
they
seemed
to
afford
the
revelation
of
such
an
charm
they
displayed
such
a
peculiar
gift
in
the
translation
of
elegance
and
grace
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
new
manner
of
expressing
the
beauty
of
form
had
been
born
to
the
world
his
specialty
was
statuettes
in
extremely
abbreviated
costumes
in
which
his
genius
displayed
an
unimaginable
delicacy
of
form
and
airy
lightness
his
dancing
girls
especially
of
which
he
had
made
many
studies
displayed
in
the
highest
perfection
in
their
pose
and
the
harmony
of
their
attitude
and
motion
the
ideal
of
female
beauty
and
suppleness
for
a
month
past
mme
de
burne
had
been
unceasing
in
her
efforts
to
attract
him
to
her
house
but
the
artist
was
unsociable
even
something
of
a
bear
so
the
report
ran
at
last
she
had
succeeded
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
lamarthe
who
had
made
a
touching
almost
frantic
appeal
to
the
grateful
sculptor
whom
have
you
besides
mariolle
inquired
the
princess
de
malten
he
was
displeased
he
did
not
fancy
that
woman
who
else
massival
bernhaus
and
george
de
maltry
that
is
all
only
my
select
circle
you
are
acquainted
with
prédolé
are
you
not
yes
slightly
how
do
you
like
him
he
is
delightful
i
never
met
a
man
so
enamored
of
his
art
and
so
interesting
when
he
holds
forth
on
it
she
was
delighted
and
again
said
it
will
be
charming
he
had
taken
her
hand
under
her
fur
cloak
he
gave
it
a
little
squeeze
then
kissed
it
then
all
at
once
it
came
to
her
mind
that
she
had
forgotten
to
tell
him
that
she
was
ill
and
casting
about
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
for
another
reason
she
murmured
gracious
how
cold
it
is
do
you
think
so
i
am
chilled
to
my
very
marrow
he
arose
to
take
a
look
at
the
thermometer
which
was
in
fact
pretty
low
then
he
resumed
his
seat
at
her
side
she
had
said
gracious
how
cold
it
is
and
he
believed
that
he
understood
her
for
three
weeks
now
at
every
one
of
their
interviews
he
had
noticed
that
her
attempt
to
feign
tenderness
was
gradually
becoming
fainter
and
fainter
he
saw
that
she
was
weary
of
wearing
this
mask
so
weary
that
she
could
continue
it
no
longer
and
he
himself
was
so
exasperated
by
the
little
power
that
he
had
over
her
so
stung
by
his
vain
and
unreasoning
desire
of
this
woman
that
he
was
beginning
to
say
to
himself
in
his
despairing
moments
of
solitude
it
will
be
better
to
break
with
her
than
to
continue
to
live
like
this
he
asked
her
by
way
of
fathoming
her
intentions
wo
you
take
off
your
cloak
now
oh
no
she
said
i
have
been
coughing
all
the
morning
this
fearful
weather
has
given
me
a
sore
throat
i
am
afraid
that
i
may
be
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
added
if
i
had
not
wanted
to
see
you
very
much
indeed
i
would
not
have
come
as
he
did
not
reply
in
his
grief
and
anger
she
went
on
this
return
of
cold
weather
is
very
dangerous
coming
as
it
does
after
the
fine
days
of
the
past
two
weeks
she
looked
out
into
the
garden
where
the
trees
were
already
almost
green
despite
the
clouds
of
snow
that
were
driving
among
their
branches
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
so
that
is
the
kind
of
love
that
she
feels
for
me
and
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
jealous
hatred
of
her
of
her
face
of
her
elusive
affection
of
her
form
so
long
pursued
so
subtle
to
escape
him
she
pretends
that
she
is
cold
he
said
to
himself
she
is
cold
only
because
i
am
here
if
it
were
a
question
of
some
party
of
pleasure
some
of
those
idiotic
caprices
that
go
to
make
up
the
useless
existence
of
these
frivolous
creatures
she
would
brave
everything
and
risk
her
life
does
she
not
ride
about
in
an
open
carriage
on
the
coldest
days
to
show
her
fine
clothes
ah
that
is
the
way
with
them
all
nowadays
he
looked
at
her
as
she
sat
there
facing
him
so
calmly
and
he
knew
that
in
that
head
that
dear
little
head
that
he
adored
so
there
was
one
wish
paramount
the
wish
that
their
might
not
be
protracted
it
was
becoming
painful
to
her
was
it
true
that
there
had
ever
existed
that
there
existed
now
women
capable
of
passion
of
emotion
who
weep
suffer
and
bestow
themselves
in
a
transport
loving
with
heart
and
soul
and
body
with
mouth
that
speaks
and
eyes
that
gaze
with
heart
that
beats
and
hand
that
caresses
women
ready
to
brave
all
for
the
sake
of
their
love
and
to
go
by
day
or
by
night
regardless
of
menaces
and
watchful
eyes
fearlessly
tremorously
to
him
who
stands
with
open
arms
waiting
to
receive
them
mad
ready
to
sink
with
their
happiness
oh
that
horrible
love
that
which
now
held
him
in
its
fetters
love
without
issue
without
end
joyless
and
triumphless
eating
away
his
strength
and
devouring
him
with
its
anxieties
love
in
which
there
was
no
charm
and
no
delight
cause
to
him
only
of
suffering
sorrow
and
bitter
tears
where
he
was
constantly
pursued
by
the
intolerable
regret
of
the
impossibility
of
awaking
responsive
kisses
upon
lips
that
are
as
cold
and
dry
and
sterile
as
dead
trees
he
looked
at
her
as
she
sat
there
so
charming
in
her
feathery
dress
were
not
her
dresses
the
great
enemy
that
he
had
to
contend
against
more
than
the
woman
herself
jealous
guardians
coquettish
and
costly
barriers
that
kept
him
from
his
mistress
your
toilette
is
charming
he
said
not
caring
to
speak
of
the
subject
that
was
torturing
him
so
cruelly
she
replied
with
a
smile
you
must
see
the
one
that
i
shall
wear
then
she
coughed
several
times
in
succession
and
said
i
am
really
taking
cold
let
me
go
my
friend
the
sun
will
show
himself
again
shortly
and
i
will
follow
his
example
he
made
no
effort
to
detain
her
for
he
was
discouraged
seeing
that
nothing
could
now
avail
to
overcome
the
inertia
of
this
sluggish
nature
that
his
romance
was
ended
ended
forever
and
that
it
was
useless
to
hope
for
ardent
words
from
those
tranquil
lips
or
a
kindling
glance
from
those
calm
eyes
all
at
once
he
felt
rising
with
gathering
strength
within
him
the
stern
determination
to
end
this
torturing
subserviency
she
had
nailed
him
upon
a
cross
he
was
bleeding
from
every
limb
and
she
watched
his
agony
without
feeling
for
his
suffering
even
rejoicing
that
she
had
had
it
in
her
power
to
effect
so
much
but
he
would
tear
himself
from
his
deathly
gibbet
leaving
there
bits
of
his
body
strips
of
his
flesh
and
all
his
mangled
heart
he
would
flee
like
a
wild
animal
that
the
hunters
have
wounded
almost
unto
death
he
would
go
and
hide
himself
in
some
lonely
place
where
his
wounds
might
heal
and
where
he
might
feel
only
those
dull
pangs
that
remain
with
the
mutilated
until
they
are
released
by
death
farewell
then
he
said
she
was
struck
by
the
sadness
of
his
voice
and
rejoined
until
this
evening
my
friend
until
this
evening
he
farewell
he
saw
her
to
the
garden
gate
and
came
back
and
seated
himself
alone
before
the
fire
alone
how
cold
it
was
how
cold
indeed
how
sad
he
was
how
lonely
it
was
all
ended
ah
what
a
horrible
thought
there
was
an
end
of
hoping
and
waiting
for
her
dreaming
of
her
with
that
fierce
blazing
of
the
heart
that
at
times
brings
out
our
existence
upon
this
somber
earth
with
the
vividness
of
fireworks
displayed
against
the
blackness
of
the
night
farewell
those
nights
of
solitary
emotion
when
almost
until
the
dawn
he
paced
his
chamber
thinking
of
her
farewell
those
wakings
when
upon
opening
his
eyes
he
said
to
himself
soon
i
shall
see
her
at
our
little
house
how
he
loved
her
how
he
loved
her
what
a
long
hard
task
it
would
be
to
him
to
forget
her
she
had
left
him
because
it
was
cold
he
saw
her
before
him
as
but
now
looking
at
him
and
bewitching
him
bewitching
him
the
better
to
break
his
heart
ah
how
well
she
had
done
her
work
with
one
single
stroke
the
first
and
last
she
had
cleft
it
asunder
he
felt
the
old
gaping
wound
begin
to
open
the
wound
that
she
had
dressed
and
now
had
made
incurable
by
plunging
into
it
the
knife
of
indifference
he
even
felt
that
from
this
broken
heart
there
was
something
distilling
itself
through
his
frame
mounting
to
his
throat
and
choking
him
then
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
as
if
to
conceal
this
weakness
even
from
himself
he
wept
she
had
left
him
because
it
was
cold
he
would
have
walked
naked
through
the
driving
snow
to
meet
her
no
matter
where
he
would
have
cast
himself
from
the
house
top
only
to
fall
at
her
feet
an
old
tale
came
to
his
mind
that
has
been
made
into
a
legend
that
of
the
côte
des
deux
amans
a
spot
which
the
traveler
may
behold
as
he
journeys
toward
rouen
a
maiden
obedient
to
her
father
cruel
caprice
which
prohibited
her
from
marrying
the
man
of
her
choice
unless
she
accomplished
the
task
of
carrying
him
unassisted
to
the
summit
of
the
steep
mountain
succeeded
in
dragging
him
up
there
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
died
as
she
reached
the
top
love
then
is
but
a
legend
made
to
be
sung
in
verse
or
told
in
lying
romances
had
not
his
mistress
herself
in
one
of
their
earliest
interviews
made
use
of
an
expression
that
he
had
never
forgotten
men
nowadays
do
not
love
women
so
as
really
to
harm
themselves
by
it
you
may
believe
me
for
i
know
them
both
she
had
been
wrong
in
his
case
but
not
in
her
own
for
on
another
occasion
she
had
said
in
any
event
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
am
incapable
of
being
really
smitten
with
anyone
be
he
who
he
may
be
he
who
he
may
was
that
quite
a
sure
thing
of
him
no
of
that
he
was
quite
well
assured
now
but
of
another
of
him
she
could
not
love
him
why
not
then
the
feeling
that
his
life
had
been
a
wasted
one
which
had
haunted
him
for
a
long
time
past
fell
upon
him
as
if
it
would
crush
him
he
had
done
nothing
obtained
nothing
conquered
nothing
succeeded
in
nothing
when
he
had
felt
an
attraction
toward
the
arts
he
had
not
found
in
himself
the
courage
that
is
required
to
devote
one
self
exclusively
to
one
of
them
nor
the
persistent
determination
that
they
demand
as
the
price
of
success
there
had
been
no
triumph
to
cheer
him
no
elevated
taste
for
some
noble
career
to
ennoble
and
aggrandize
his
mind
the
only
strenuous
effort
that
he
had
ever
put
forth
the
attempt
to
conquer
a
woman
heart
had
proved
ineffectual
like
all
the
rest
take
him
all
in
all
he
was
only
a
miserable
failure
he
was
weeping
still
beneath
his
hands
which
he
held
pressed
to
his
eyes
the
tears
trickling
down
his
cheeks
wet
his
mustache
and
left
a
salty
taste
upon
his
lips
and
their
bitterness
increased
his
wretchedness
and
his
despair
when
he
raised
his
head
at
last
he
saw
that
it
was
night
he
had
only
just
sufficient
time
to
go
home
and
dress
for
her
dinner
chapter
x
flight
andré
mariolle
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
mme
de
burne
he
took
a
seat
and
gazed
about
him
upon
the
walls
the
furniture
the
hangings
at
all
the
small
objects
and
trinkets
that
were
so
dear
to
him
from
their
association
with
her
at
the
familiar
apartment
where
he
had
first
known
her
where
he
had
come
to
her
so
many
times
since
then
and
where
he
had
discovered
in
himself
the
germs
of
that
passion
that
had
kept
on
growing
day
by
day
until
the
hour
of
his
barren
victory
with
what
eagerness
had
he
many
a
time
awaited
her
coming
in
this
charming
spot
which
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
no
one
but
her
an
exquisite
setting
for
an
exquisite
creature
how
well
he
knew
the
pervading
odor
of
this
salon
and
its
hangings
a
subdued
odor
of
iris
so
simple
and
aristocratic
he
grasped
the
arms
of
the
great
armchair
from
which
he
had
so
often
watched
her
smile
and
listened
to
her
talk
as
if
they
had
been
the
hands
of
some
friend
that
he
was
parting
with
forever
it
would
have
pleased
him
if
she
could
not
come
if
no
one
could
come
and
if
he
could
remain
there
alone
all
night
dreaming
of
his
love
as
people
watch
beside
a
dead
man
then
at
daylight
he
could
go
away
for
a
long
time
perhaps
forever
the
door
opened
and
she
appeared
and
came
forward
to
him
with
outstretched
hand
he
was
master
of
himself
and
showed
nothing
of
his
agitation
she
was
not
a
woman
but
a
living
bouquet
an
indescribable
bouquet
of
flowers
a
girdle
of
pinks
enclasped
her
waist
and
fell
about
her
in
cascades
reaching
to
her
feet
about
her
bare
arms
and
shoulders
ran
a
garland
of
mingled
myosotis
and
while
three
orchids
seemed
to
be
growing
from
her
breast
and
caressing
the
flesh
with
the
rosy
and
red
flesh
of
their
supernal
blooms
her
blond
hair
was
studded
with
violets
in
enamel
in
which
minute
diamonds
glistened
and
other
diamonds
trembling
upon
golden
pins
sparkled
like
dewdrops
among
the
odorous
trimming
of
her
corsage
i
shall
have
a
headache
she
said
but
i
do
care
my
dress
is
becoming
delicious
odors
emanated
from
her
like
spring
among
the
gardens
she
was
more
fresh
than
the
garlands
that
she
wore
andré
was
dazzled
as
he
looked
at
her
reflecting
that
it
would
be
no
less
brutal
and
barbarous
to
take
her
in
his
arms
at
that
moment
than
it
would
be
to
trample
upon
a
blossoming
so
their
bodies
were
no
longer
objects
to
inspire
love
they
were
objects
to
be
adorned
simply
frames
on
which
to
hang
fine
clothes
they
were
like
birds
they
were
like
flowers
they
were
like
a
thousand
other
things
as
much
as
they
were
like
women
their
mothers
all
women
of
past
and
gone
generations
had
used
coquettish
arts
to
enhance
their
natural
beauties
but
it
had
been
their
aim
to
please
in
the
first
place
by
their
direct
physical
seductiveness
by
the
charm
of
native
grace
by
the
irresistible
attraction
that
the
female
form
exercises
over
the
heart
of
the
males
at
the
present
day
coquetry
was
everything
artifice
was
now
the
great
means
and
not
only
the
means
but
the
end
as
well
for
they
employed
it
even
more
frequently
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
rivals
and
excite
barren
jealousy
than
to
subjugate
men
what
end
then
was
this
toilette
designed
to
serve
the
gratification
of
the
eyes
of
him
the
lover
or
the
humiliation
of
the
princess
de
malten
the
door
opened
and
the
lady
whose
name
was
in
his
thoughts
was
announced
mme
de
burne
moved
quickly
forward
to
meet
her
and
gave
her
a
kiss
not
unmindful
of
the
orchids
during
the
operation
her
lips
slightly
parted
with
a
little
grimace
of
tenderness
it
was
a
pretty
kiss
an
extremely
desirable
kiss
given
and
returned
from
the
heart
by
those
two
pairs
of
lips
mariolle
gave
a
start
of
pain
never
once
had
she
run
to
meet
him
with
that
joyful
eagerness
never
had
she
kissed
him
like
that
and
with
a
sudden
change
of
ideas
he
said
to
himself
women
are
no
longer
made
to
fulfill
our
requirements
massival
made
his
appearance
then
de
pradon
and
the
comte
de
bernhaus
then
george
de
maltry
resplendent
with
english
chic
lamarthe
and
prédolé
were
now
the
only
ones
missing
the
name
was
mentioned
and
every
voice
was
at
once
raised
in
praise
of
him
he
had
restored
to
life
the
grace
of
form
he
had
recovered
the
lost
traditions
of
the
renaissance
with
something
additional
the
sincerity
of
modern
art
de
maltry
maintained
that
he
was
the
exquisite
revealer
of
the
suppleness
of
the
human
form
such
phrases
as
these
had
been
current
in
the
salons
for
the
last
two
months
where
they
had
been
bandied
about
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
last
the
great
man
appeared
everyone
was
surprised
he
was
a
large
man
of
uncertain
age
with
the
shoulders
of
a
a
powerful
face
with
features
surrounded
by
hair
and
beard
that
were
beginning
to
turn
white
a
prominent
nose
thick
full
lips
wearing
a
timid
and
embarrassed
air
he
held
his
arms
away
from
his
body
in
an
awkward
sort
of
way
that
was
doubtless
to
be
attributed
to
the
immense
hands
that
protruded
from
his
sleeves
they
were
broad
and
thick
with
hairy
and
muscular
fingers
the
hands
of
a
hercules
or
a
butcher
and
they
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
being
in
the
way
embarrassed
at
finding
themselves
there
and
looking
vainly
for
some
convenient
place
to
hide
themselves
upon
looking
more
closely
at
his
face
however
it
was
seen
to
be
illuminated
by
clear
piercing
gray
eyes
of
extreme
expressiveness
and
these
alone
served
to
impart
some
degree
of
life
to
the
man
heavy
and
torpid
expression
they
were
constantly
searching
inquiring
scrutinizing
darting
their
rapid
shifting
glances
here
there
and
everywhere
and
it
was
plainly
to
be
seen
that
these
eager
inquisitive
looks
were
the
animating
principle
of
a
deep
and
comprehensive
intellect
mme
de
burne
was
somewhat
disappointed
she
politely
led
the
artist
to
a
chair
which
he
took
and
where
he
remained
seated
apparently
disconcerted
by
this
introduction
to
a
strange
house
lamarthe
master
of
the
situation
approached
his
friend
with
the
intention
of
breaking
the
ice
and
relieving
him
from
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
my
dear
fellow
he
said
let
me
make
for
you
a
little
map
to
let
you
know
where
you
are
you
have
seen
our
divine
hostess
now
look
at
her
surroundings
he
showed
him
upon
the
mantelpiece
a
bust
authenticated
in
due
form
by
houdon
then
upon
a
cabinet
in
buhl
a
group
representing
two
women
dancing
with
arms
about
each
other
waists
by
clodion
and
finally
four
tanagra
statuettes
upon
an
selected
for
their
perfection
of
finish
and
detail
then
all
at
once
prédolé
face
brightened
as
if
he
had
found
his
children
in
the
desert
he
arose
and
went
to
the
four
little
earthen
figures
and
when
mme
de
burne
saw
him
grasp
two
of
them
at
once
in
his
great
hands
that
seemed
made
to
slaughter
oxen
she
trembled
for
her
treasures
when
he
laid
hands
on
them
however
it
appeared
that
it
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
caressing
them
for
he
handled
them
with
wonderful
delicacy
and
dexterity
turning
them
about
in
his
thick
fingers
which
somehow
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
become
as
supple
as
a
juggler
it
was
evident
by
the
gentle
way
the
big
man
had
of
looking
at
and
handling
them
that
he
had
in
his
soul
and
his
very
an
ideal
and
delicate
tenderness
for
such
small
elegancies
are
they
not
pretty
lamarthe
asked
him
the
sculptor
went
on
to
extol
them
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
and
he
spoke
of
some
others
the
most
remarkable
that
he
had
met
with
briefly
and
in
a
voice
that
was
rather
low
but
confident
and
calm
the
expression
of
a
clearly
defined
thought
that
was
not
ignorant
of
the
value
of
words
and
their
uses
still
under
the
guidance
of
the
author
he
next
inspected
the
other
rare
that
mme
de
burne
had
collected
thanks
to
the
counsels
of
her
friends
he
looked
with
astonishment
and
delight
at
the
various
articles
apparently
agreeably
disappointed
to
find
them
there
and
in
every
case
he
took
them
up
and
turned
them
lightly
over
in
his
hands
as
if
to
place
himself
in
direct
personal
contact
with
them
there
was
a
statuette
of
bronze
heavy
as
a
hidden
away
in
a
dark
corner
he
took
it
up
with
one
hand
carried
it
to
the
lamp
examined
it
at
length
and
replaced
it
where
it
belonged
without
visible
effort
lamarthe
exclaimed
the
great
strong
fellow
he
is
built
expressly
to
wrestle
with
stone
and
marble
while
the
ladies
looked
at
him
approvingly
dinner
was
now
announced
the
mistress
of
the
house
took
the
arm
to
pass
to
the
and
when
she
had
seated
him
in
the
place
of
honor
at
her
right
hand
she
asked
him
out
of
courtesy
just
as
she
would
have
questioned
a
scion
of
some
great
family
as
to
the
exact
origin
of
his
name
your
art
monsieur
has
also
the
additional
honor
has
it
not
of
being
the
most
ancient
of
all
he
replied
in
his
calm
deep
voice
mon
madame
the
shepherds
in
the
bible
play
upon
the
flute
therefore
music
would
seem
to
be
the
more
ancient
although
true
music
as
we
understand
it
does
not
go
very
far
back
while
true
sculpture
dates
from
remote
antiquity
you
are
fond
of
music
i
love
all
the
arts
he
replied
with
grave
earnestness
is
it
known
who
was
the
inventor
of
your
art
he
reflected
a
moment
then
replied
in
tender
accents
as
if
he
had
been
relating
some
touching
tale
according
to
grecian
tradition
it
was
dædalus
the
athenian
the
most
attractive
legend
however
is
that
which
attributes
the
invention
to
a
sicyonian
potter
named
dibutades
his
daughter
kora
having
traced
her
betrothed
profile
with
the
assistance
of
an
arrow
her
father
filled
in
the
rude
sketch
with
clay
and
modeled
it
it
was
then
that
my
art
was
born
charming
murmured
lamarthe
then
turning
to
mme
de
burne
he
said
you
can
not
imagine
madame
how
interesting
this
man
becomes
when
he
talks
of
what
he
loves
what
power
he
has
to
express
and
explain
it
and
make
people
adore
it
but
the
sculptor
did
not
seem
disposed
either
to
pose
for
the
admiration
of
the
guests
or
to
perorate
he
had
tucked
a
corner
of
his
napkin
between
his
and
his
neck
and
was
reverentially
eating
his
soup
with
that
appearance
of
respect
that
peasants
manifest
for
that
portion
of
the
meal
then
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
drew
himself
up
with
an
air
of
greater
ease
of
making
himself
more
at
home
now
and
then
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
turn
around
for
he
had
perceived
the
reflection
in
a
mirror
of
a
modern
group
that
stood
on
the
mantelshelf
behind
him
he
did
not
recognize
it
and
was
seeking
to
divine
the
author
at
last
unable
longer
to
resist
the
impulse
he
asked
it
is
by
falguière
is
it
not
mme
de
burne
laughed
yes
it
is
by
falguière
how
could
you
tell
in
a
glass
he
smiled
in
turn
ah
madame
i
ca
explain
how
it
is
done
but
i
can
tell
at
a
glance
the
sculpture
of
those
men
who
are
painters
as
well
and
the
painting
of
those
who
also
practice
sculpture
it
is
not
a
bit
like
the
work
of
a
man
who
devotes
himself
to
one
art
exclusively
lamarthe
wishing
to
show
off
his
friend
called
for
explanations
and
prédolé
proceeded
to
give
them
in
his
slow
precise
manner
of
speech
he
defined
and
illustrated
the
painting
of
sculptors
and
the
sculpture
of
painters
in
such
a
clear
and
original
way
that
he
was
listened
to
as
much
with
eyes
as
with
ears
commencing
his
demonstration
at
the
earliest
period
and
pursuing
it
through
the
history
of
art
and
gathering
examples
from
epoch
to
epoch
he
came
down
to
the
time
of
the
early
italian
masters
who
were
painters
and
sculptors
at
the
same
time
nicolas
and
john
of
pisa
donatello
lorenzo
ghiberti
he
spoke
of
diderot
interesting
remarks
upon
the
same
subject
and
in
conclusion
mentioned
ghiberti
bronze
gates
of
the
baptistry
of
saint
john
at
florence
such
living
and
dramatically
forceful
that
they
seem
more
like
paintings
upon
canvas
he
waved
his
great
hands
before
him
as
if
he
were
modeling
with
such
ease
and
grace
of
motion
as
to
delight
every
eye
calling
up
above
the
plates
and
glasses
the
pictures
that
his
tongue
told
of
and
reconstructing
the
work
that
he
mentioned
with
such
conviction
that
everyone
followed
the
motions
of
his
fingers
with
breathless
attention
then
some
dishes
that
he
fancied
were
placed
before
him
and
he
ceased
talking
and
began
eating
he
scarcely
spoke
during
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
not
troubling
himself
to
follow
the
conversation
which
ranged
from
some
bit
of
theatrical
gossip
to
a
political
rumor
from
a
ball
to
a
wedding
from
an
article
in
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
to
the
that
had
just
opened
his
appetite
was
good
and
he
drank
a
good
deal
without
being
at
all
affected
by
it
having
a
sound
hard
head
that
good
wine
could
not
easily
upset
when
they
had
returned
to
the
lamarthe
who
had
not
drawn
the
sculptor
out
to
the
extent
that
he
wished
to
do
drew
him
over
to
a
glass
case
to
show
him
a
priceless
object
a
classic
historic
gem
a
silver
inkstand
carved
by
benvenuto
cellini
the
men
listened
with
extreme
interest
to
his
long
and
eloquent
rhapsody
as
they
stood
grouped
about
him
while
the
two
women
seated
in
front
of
the
fire
and
rather
disgusted
to
see
so
much
enthusiasm
wasted
upon
the
form
of
inanimate
objects
appeared
to
be
a
little
bored
and
chatted
together
in
a
low
voice
from
time
to
time
after
that
conversation
became
general
but
not
animated
for
it
had
been
somewhat
damped
by
the
ideas
that
had
passed
into
the
atmosphere
of
this
pretty
room
with
its
furnishing
of
precious
objects
prédolé
left
early
assigning
as
a
reason
that
he
had
to
be
at
work
at
daybreak
every
morning
when
he
was
gone
lamarthe
enthusiastically
asked
mme
de
burne
well
how
did
you
like
him
she
replied
hesitatingly
and
with
something
of
an
air
of
ill
nature
he
is
quite
interesting
but
prosy
the
novelist
smiled
and
said
to
himself
that
is
because
he
did
not
admire
your
toilette
and
you
are
the
only
one
of
all
your
pretty
things
that
he
hardly
condescended
to
look
at
he
exchanged
a
few
pleasant
remarks
with
her
and
went
over
and
took
a
seat
by
mme
de
malten
to
whom
he
began
to
be
very
attentive
the
comte
de
bernhaus
approached
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
taking
a
small
footstool
appeared
sunk
in
devotion
at
her
feet
mariolle
massival
maltry
and
de
pradon
continued
to
talk
of
the
sculptor
who
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
their
minds
de
maltry
was
comparing
him
to
the
old
masters
for
whom
life
was
embellished
and
illuminated
by
an
exclusive
and
consuming
love
of
the
manifestations
of
beauty
and
he
philosophized
upon
his
theme
with
many
very
subtle
and
very
tiresome
observations
massival
quickly
tiring
of
a
conversation
which
made
no
reference
to
his
own
art
crossed
the
room
to
mme
de
malten
and
seated
himself
beside
lamarthe
who
soon
yielded
his
place
to
him
and
went
and
rejoined
the
men
shall
we
go
he
said
to
mariolle
yes
by
all
means
the
novelist
liked
to
walk
the
streets
at
night
with
some
friend
and
talk
when
the
incisive
peremptory
tones
of
his
voice
seemed
to
lay
hold
of
the
walls
of
the
houses
and
climb
up
them
he
had
an
impression
that
he
was
very
eloquent
witty
and
sagacious
during
these
nocturnal
which
were
monologues
rather
than
conversations
so
far
as
his
part
in
them
was
concerned
the
approbation
that
he
thus
gained
for
himself
sufficed
his
needs
and
the
gentle
fatigue
of
legs
and
lungs
assured
him
a
good
night
rest
mariolle
for
his
part
had
reached
the
limit
of
his
endurance
the
moment
that
he
was
outside
her
door
all
his
wretchedness
and
sorrow
all
his
irremediable
disappointment
boiled
up
and
overflowed
his
heart
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
he
would
go
away
and
never
return
the
two
men
found
themselves
alone
with
each
other
in
the
street
the
wind
had
changed
and
the
cold
that
had
prevailed
during
the
day
had
yielded
it
was
warm
and
pleasant
as
it
almost
always
is
two
hours
after
a
snowstorm
in
spring
the
sky
was
vibrating
with
the
light
of
innumerable
stars
as
if
a
breath
of
summer
in
the
immensity
of
space
had
lighted
up
the
heavenly
bodies
and
set
them
twinkling
the
sidewalks
were
gray
and
dry
again
while
in
the
roadway
pools
of
water
reflected
the
light
of
the
lamarthe
said
what
a
fortunate
man
he
is
that
prédolé
he
lives
only
for
one
thing
his
art
thinks
but
of
that
loves
but
that
it
occupies
all
his
being
consoles
and
cheers
him
and
affords
him
a
life
of
happiness
and
comfort
he
is
really
a
great
artist
of
the
old
stock
ah
he
does
let
women
trouble
his
head
not
much
our
women
of
with
their
frills
and
furbelows
and
fantastic
disguises
did
you
remark
how
little
attention
he
paid
to
our
two
pretty
dames
and
yet
they
were
rather
seductive
but
what
he
is
looking
for
is
the
plastic
the
plastic
pure
and
simple
he
has
no
use
for
the
artificial
it
is
true
that
our
divine
hostess
put
him
down
in
her
books
as
an
insupportable
fool
in
her
estimation
a
bust
by
houdon
tanagra
statuettes
and
an
inkstand
by
cellini
are
but
so
many
unconsidered
trifles
that
go
to
the
adornment
and
the
rich
and
natural
setting
of
a
masterpiece
which
is
herself
she
and
her
dress
for
dress
is
part
and
parcel
of
herself
it
is
the
fresh
accentuation
that
she
places
on
her
beauty
day
by
day
what
a
trivial
personal
thing
is
woman
he
stopped
and
gave
the
sidewalk
a
great
thump
with
his
cane
so
that
the
noise
resounded
through
the
quiet
street
then
he
went
on
they
have
a
very
clear
and
exact
perception
of
what
adds
to
their
attractions
the
toilette
and
the
ornaments
in
which
there
is
an
entire
change
of
fashion
every
ten
years
but
they
are
heedless
of
that
attribute
which
involves
rare
and
constant
power
of
selection
which
demands
from
them
keen
and
delicate
artistic
penetration
and
a
purely
æsthetic
exercise
of
their
senses
their
senses
moreover
are
extremely
rudimentary
incapable
of
high
development
inaccessible
to
whatever
does
not
touch
directly
the
feminine
egotism
that
absorbs
everything
in
them
their
acuteness
is
the
stratagem
of
the
savage
of
the
red
indian
of
war
and
ambush
they
are
even
almost
incapable
of
enjoying
the
material
pleasures
of
the
lower
order
which
require
a
physical
education
and
the
intelligent
exercise
of
an
organ
such
as
good
living
when
as
they
do
in
exceptional
cases
they
come
to
have
some
respect
for
decent
cookery
they
still
remain
incapable
of
appreciating
our
great
wines
which
speak
to
masculine
palates
only
for
wine
does
speak
he
again
thumped
the
pavement
with
his
cane
accenting
his
last
dictum
and
punctuating
the
sentence
and
continued
it
wo
do
however
to
expect
too
much
from
them
but
this
want
of
taste
and
appreciation
that
so
frequently
clouds
their
intellectual
vision
when
higher
considerations
are
at
stake
often
serves
to
blind
them
still
more
when
our
interests
are
in
question
a
man
may
have
heart
feeling
intelligence
exceptional
merits
and
qualities
of
all
kinds
they
will
all
be
unavailing
to
secure
their
favor
as
in
bygone
days
when
a
man
was
valued
for
his
worth
and
his
courage
the
women
of
are
actresses
actresses
at
that
who
are
merely
playing
for
effect
a
part
that
has
been
handed
down
to
them
and
in
which
they
have
no
belief
they
have
to
have
actors
of
the
same
stamp
to
act
up
to
them
and
lie
through
the
rôle
just
as
they
do
and
these
actors
are
the
coxcombs
that
we
see
hanging
around
them
from
the
fashionable
world
or
elsewhere
they
walked
along
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
side
by
side
mariolle
had
listened
attentively
to
the
words
of
his
companion
repeating
them
in
his
mind
and
approving
of
his
sentiments
under
the
influence
of
his
sorrow
he
was
aware
also
that
a
sort
of
italian
adventurer
who
was
then
in
paris
giving
lessons
in
swordsmanship
prince
epilati
by
name
a
gentleman
of
the
of
considerable
celebrity
for
his
elegance
and
graceful
vigor
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
exhibiting
in
tights
before
the
upper
ten
and
the
select
few
of
the
demimonde
was
just
then
in
full
enjoyment
of
the
attentions
and
coquetries
of
the
pretty
little
baronne
de
frémines
as
lamarthe
said
nothing
further
he
remarked
to
him
it
is
all
our
own
fault
we
make
our
selections
badly
there
are
other
women
besides
those
the
novelist
replied
the
only
ones
now
that
are
capable
of
real
attachment
are
the
shopgirls
and
some
sentimental
little
poor
and
unhappily
married
i
have
before
now
carried
consolation
to
one
of
those
distressed
souls
they
are
overflowing
with
sentiment
but
such
cheap
vulgar
sentiment
that
to
exchange
ours
against
it
is
like
throwing
your
money
to
a
beggar
now
i
assert
that
in
our
young
wealthy
society
where
the
women
feel
no
needs
and
no
desires
where
all
that
they
require
is
some
mild
distraction
to
enable
them
to
kill
time
and
where
the
men
regulate
their
pleasures
as
scrupulously
as
they
regulate
their
daily
labors
i
assert
that
under
such
conditions
the
old
natural
attraction
charming
and
powerful
as
it
was
that
used
to
bring
the
sexes
toward
each
other
has
disappeared
you
are
right
mariolle
murmured
he
felt
an
increasing
desire
to
fly
to
put
a
great
distance
between
himself
and
these
people
these
puppets
who
in
their
empty
idleness
mimicked
the
beautiful
impassioned
and
tender
life
of
other
days
and
were
incapable
of
savoring
its
lost
delights
good
night
he
said
i
am
going
to
bed
he
went
home
and
seated
himself
at
his
table
and
wrote
farewell
madame
do
you
remember
my
first
letter
in
it
too
i
said
farewell
but
i
did
not
go
what
a
mistake
that
was
when
you
receive
this
i
shall
have
left
paris
need
i
tell
you
why
men
like
me
ought
never
to
meet
with
women
like
you
were
i
an
artist
and
were
my
emotions
capable
of
expression
in
such
manner
as
to
afford
me
consolation
you
would
have
perhaps
inspired
me
with
talent
but
i
am
only
a
poor
fellow
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
seized
with
love
for
you
and
with
it
its
accompanying
bitter
unendurable
sorrow
when
i
met
you
for
the
first
time
i
could
not
have
deemed
myself
capable
of
feeling
and
suffering
as
i
have
done
another
in
your
place
would
have
filled
my
heart
with
divine
joy
in
bidding
it
wake
and
live
but
you
could
do
nothing
but
torture
it
it
was
not
your
fault
i
know
i
reproach
you
with
nothing
and
i
bear
you
no
hard
feeling
i
have
not
even
the
right
to
send
you
these
lines
pardon
me
you
are
so
constituted
that
you
can
not
feel
as
i
feel
you
can
not
even
divine
what
passes
in
my
breast
when
i
am
with
you
when
you
speak
to
me
and
i
look
on
you
yes
i
know
you
have
accepted
me
and
offered
me
a
rational
and
tranquil
happiness
for
which
i
ought
to
thank
you
on
my
knees
all
my
life
long
but
i
will
not
have
it
ah
what
a
horrible
agonizing
love
is
that
which
is
constantly
craving
a
tender
word
a
warm
caress
without
ever
receiving
them
my
heart
is
empty
empty
as
the
stomach
of
a
beggar
who
has
long
followed
your
carriage
with
outstretched
hand
and
to
whom
you
have
thrown
out
pretty
toys
but
no
bread
it
was
bread
it
was
love
that
i
hungered
for
i
am
about
to
go
away
wretched
and
in
need
in
sore
need
of
your
love
a
few
crumbs
of
which
would
have
saved
me
i
have
nothing
left
in
the
world
but
a
cruel
memory
that
clings
and
will
not
leave
me
and
that
i
must
try
to
kill
adieu
madame
thanks
and
pardon
me
i
love
you
still

evening
with
all
the

chapter
xi
loneliness
the
city
lay
basking
in
the
brightness
of
a
sunny
morning
mariolle
climbed
into
the
carriage
that
stood
waiting
at
his
door
with
a
traveling
bag
and
two
trunks
on
top
he
had
made
his
valet
the
night
before
pack
the
linen
and
other
necessaries
for
a
long
absence
and
now
he
was
going
away
leaving
as
his
temporary
address
fontainebleau
he
was
taking
no
one
with
him
it
being
his
wish
to
see
no
face
that
might
remind
him
of
paris
and
to
hear
no
voice
that
he
had
heard
while
brooding
over
certain
matters
he
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
lyons
station
and
the
cab
started
then
he
thought
of
that
other
trip
of
his
last
spring
to
mont
it
was
a
year
ago
now
lacking
three
months
he
looked
out
into
the
street
to
drive
the
recollection
from
his
mind
the
vehicle
turned
into
the
avenue
des
which
was
flooded
with
the
light
of
the
sun
of
early
spring
the
green
leaves
summoned
forth
by
the
grateful
warmth
that
had
prevailed
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
not
materially
retarded
by
the
cold
storm
of
the
last
two
days
were
opening
so
rapidly
on
this
bright
morning
that
they
seemed
to
impregnate
the
air
with
an
odor
of
fresh
verdure
and
of
sap
evaporating
on
the
way
to
its
work
of
building
up
new
growths
it
was
one
of
those
growing
mornings
when
one
feels
that
the
in
the
public
gardens
and
all
along
the
avenues
will
burst
into
bloom
in
a
single
day
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
paris
like
chandeliers
that
are
lighted
simultaneously
the
earth
was
thrilling
with
the
movement
preparatory
to
the
full
life
of
summer
and
the
very
street
was
silently
stirred
beneath
its
paving
of
bitumen
as
the
roots
ate
their
way
through
the
soil
he
said
to
himself
as
he
jolted
along
in
his
cab
at
last
i
shall
be
able
to
enjoy
a
little
peace
of
mind
i
will
witness
the
birth
of
spring
in
solitude
deep
in
the
forest
the
journey
seemed
long
to
him
the
few
hours
of
sleeplessness
that
he
had
spent
in
bemoaning
his
fate
had
broken
him
down
as
if
he
had
passed
ten
nights
at
the
bedside
of
a
dying
man
when
he
reached
the
village
of
fontainebleau
he
went
to
a
notary
to
see
if
there
was
a
small
house
to
be
had
furnished
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
forest
he
was
told
of
several
in
looking
over
the
photographs
the
one
that
pleased
him
most
was
a
cottage
that
had
just
been
given
up
by
a
young
couple
man
and
wife
who
had
resided
for
almost
the
entire
winter
in
the
village
of
the
notary
smiled
notwithstanding
that
he
was
a
man
of
serious
aspect
he
probably
scented
a
love
story
you
are
alone
monsieur
he
inquired
i
am
alone
no
servants
even
no
servants
even
i
left
them
at
paris
i
wish
to
engage
some
of
the
residents
here
i
am
coming
here
to
work
in
complete
seclusion
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
that
at
this
season
of
the
year
a
few
minutes
afterward
an
open
landau
was
whirling
mariolle
and
his
trunks
away
to
montigny
the
forest
was
beginning
to
awake
the
copses
at
the
foot
of
the
great
trees
whose
heads
were
covered
with
a
light
veil
of
foliage
were
beginning
to
assume
a
denser
aspect
the
early
birches
with
their
silvery
trunks
were
the
only
trees
that
seemed
completely
attired
for
the
summer
while
the
great
oaks
only
displayed
small
tremulous
splashes
of
green
at
the
ends
of
their
branches
and
the
beeches
more
quick
to
open
their
pointed
buds
were
just
shedding
the
dead
leaves
of
the
past
year
the
grass
by
the
roadside
unobscured
as
yet
by
the
thick
shade
of
the
was
growing
lush
and
bright
with
the
influx
of
new
sap
and
the
odor
of
new
growth
that
mariolle
had
already
remarked
in
the
avenue
des
now
wrapped
him
about
and
immersed
him
in
a
great
bath
of
green
life
budding
in
the
sunshine
of
the
early
season
he
inhaled
it
greedily
like
one
just
liberated
from
prison
and
with
the
sensation
of
a
man
whose
fetters
have
just
been
broken
he
luxuriously
extended
his
arms
along
the
two
sides
of
the
landau
and
let
his
hands
hang
down
over
the
two
wheels
he
passed
through
marlotte
where
the
driver
called
his
attention
to
the
hotel
corot
then
just
opened
of
the
original
design
of
which
there
was
much
talk
then
the
road
continued
with
the
forest
on
the
left
hand
and
on
the
right
a
wide
plain
with
trees
here
and
there
and
hills
bounding
the
horizon
to
this
succeeded
a
long
village
street
a
blinding
white
street
lying
between
two
endless
rows
of
little
houses
here
and
there
an
enormous
lilac
bush
displayed
its
flowers
over
the
top
of
a
wall
this
street
followed
the
course
of
a
narrow
valley
along
which
ran
a
little
stream
it
was
a
narrow
rapid
twisting
nimble
little
stream
on
one
of
its
banks
laving
the
foundations
of
the
houses
and
the
and
on
the
other
bathing
the
meadows
where
the
small
trees
were
just
beginning
to
put
forth
their
scanty
foliage
the
sight
of
it
inspired
mariolle
with
a
sensation
of
delight
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
his
house
and
was
greatly
pleased
with
it
it
was
an
old
house
that
had
been
restored
by
a
painter
who
had
tired
of
it
after
living
there
five
years
and
offered
it
for
rent
it
was
directly
on
the
water
separated
from
the
stream
only
by
a
pretty
garden
that
ended
in
a
terrace
of
lindens
the
loing
which
just
above
this
point
had
a
picturesque
fall
of
a
foot
or
two
over
a
dam
erected
there
ran
rapidly
by
this
terrace
whirling
in
great
eddies
from
the
front
windows
of
the
house
the
meadows
on
the
other
bank
were
visible
i
shall
get
well
here
mariolle
thought
everything
had
been
arranged
with
the
notary
in
case
the
house
should
prove
suitable
the
driver
carried
back
his
acceptance
of
it
then
the
housekeeping
details
had
to
be
attended
to
which
did
not
take
much
time
the
mayor
clerk
having
provided
two
women
one
to
do
the
cooking
the
other
to
wash
and
attend
to
the
downstairs
there
were
a
parlor
kitchen
and
two
small
rooms
on
the
floor
above
a
handsome
bedroom
and
a
large
apartment
that
the
artist
owner
had
fitted
up
as
a
studio
the
furniture
had
all
been
selected
with
loving
care
as
people
always
furnish
when
they
are
enamored
of
a
place
but
now
it
had
lost
a
little
of
its
freshness
and
was
in
some
disorder
with
the
air
of
desolation
that
is
noticeable
in
dwellings
that
have
been
abandoned
by
their
master
a
pleasant
odor
of
verbena
however
still
lingered
in
the
air
showing
that
the
little
house
had
not
been
long
uninhabited
ah
thought
mariolle
verbena
that
indicates
simplicity
of
taste
the
woman
that
preceded
me
could
not
have
been
one
of
those
complex
mystifying
natures
happy
man
it
was
getting
toward
evening
all
these
occupations
having
made
the
day
pass
rapidly
he
took
a
seat
by
an
open
window
drinking
in
the
agreeable
coolness
that
exhaled
from
the
surrounding
vegetation
and
watching
the
setting
sun
as
it
cast
long
shadows
across
the
meadows
the
two
servants
were
talking
while
getting
the
dinner
ready
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
ascended
to
him
faintly
by
the
stairway
while
through
the
window
came
the
mingled
sounds
of
the
lowing
of
cows
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
cries
of
men
bringing
home
the
cattle
or
conversing
with
their
companions
on
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
everything
was
peaceful
and
restful
for
the
thousandth
time
since
the
morning
mariolle
asked
himself
what
did
she
think
when
she
received
my
letter
what
will
she
do
then
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
what
she
is
doing
now
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
half
past
six
she
has
come
in
from
the
street
she
is
receiving
there
rose
before
his
mental
vision
a
picture
of
the
and
the
young
woman
chatting
with
the
princess
de
malten
mme
de
frémines
massival
and
the
comte
de
bernhaus
his
soul
was
suddenly
moved
with
an
impulse
that
was
something
like
anger
he
wished
that
he
was
there
it
was
the
hour
of
his
accustomed
visit
to
her
almost
every
day
and
he
felt
within
him
a
feeling
of
discomfort
not
of
regret
his
will
was
firm
but
a
sort
of
physical
suffering
afflicted
him
akin
to
that
of
one
who
is
denied
his
morphine
at
the
accustomed
time
he
no
longer
beheld
the
meadows
nor
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
hills
of
the
horizon
all
that
he
could
see
was
her
among
her
friends
given
over
to
those
cares
of
the
world
that
had
robbed
him
of
her
i
will
think
of
her
no
more
he
said
to
himself
he
arose
went
down
to
the
garden
and
passed
on
to
the
terrace
there
was
a
cool
mist
there
rising
from
the
water
that
had
been
agitated
in
its
fall
over
the
dam
and
this
sensation
of
chilliness
striking
to
a
heart
already
sad
caused
him
to
retrace
his
steps
his
dinner
was
awaiting
him
in
the
he
ate
it
quickly
then
having
nothing
to
occupy
him
and
feeling
that
distress
of
mind
and
body
of
which
he
had
had
the
presage
now
increasing
on
him
he
went
to
bed
and
closed
his
eyes
in
an
attempt
to
slumber
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
his
thoughts
refused
to
leave
that
woman
he
beheld
her
in
his
thought
and
he
suffered
on
whom
would
she
bestow
her
favor
now
on
the
comte
de
bernhaus
doubtless
he
was
just
the
man
elegant
conspicuous
sought
after
to
suit
that
creature
of
display
he
had
found
favor
with
her
for
had
she
not
employed
all
her
arts
to
conquer
him
even
at
a
time
when
she
was
mistress
to
another
man
notwithstanding
that
his
mind
was
beset
by
these
haunting
thoughts
it
would
still
keep
wandering
off
into
that
misty
condition
of
in
which
the
man
and
woman
were
constantly
reappearing
to
his
eyes
of
true
sleep
he
got
none
and
all
night
long
he
saw
them
at
his
bedside
braving
and
mocking
him
now
retiring
as
if
they
would
at
last
permit
him
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
then
returning
as
soon
as
oblivion
had
begun
to
creep
over
him
and
awaking
him
with
a
spasm
of
jealous
agony
in
his
heart
he
left
his
bed
at
earliest
break
of
day
and
went
away
into
the
forest
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
a
stout
serviceable
stick
that
the
last
occupant
of
the
house
had
left
behind
him
the
rays
of
the
newly
risen
sun
were
falling
through
the
tops
of
the
oaks
almost
leafless
as
yet
upon
the
ground
which
was
carpeted
in
spots
by
patches
of
verdant
grass
here
by
a
carpet
of
dead
leaves
and
there
by
heather
reddened
by
the
frosts
of
winter
yellow
butterflies
were
fluttering
along
the
road
like
little
dancing
flames
to
the
right
of
the
road
was
a
hill
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
a
mountain
mariolle
ascended
it
leisurely
and
when
he
reached
the
top
seated
himself
on
a
great
stone
for
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
his
legs
were
overcome
with
weakness
and
refused
to
support
him
all
his
system
seemed
to
be
yielding
to
a
sudden
breaking
down
he
was
well
aware
that
this
languor
did
not
proceed
from
fatigue
it
came
from
her
from
the
love
that
weighed
him
down
like
an
intolerable
burden
and
he
murmured
what
wretchedness
why
does
it
possess
me
thus
me
a
man
who
has
always
taken
from
existence
only
that
which
would
enable
him
to
enjoy
it
without
suffering
afterward
his
attention
was
awakened
by
the
fear
of
this
malady
that
might
prove
so
hard
to
cure
and
he
probed
his
feelings
went
down
to
the
very
depths
of
his
nature
endeavoring
to
know
and
understand
it
better
and
make
clear
to
his
own
eyes
the
reason
of
this
inexplicable
crisis
he
said
to
himself
i
have
never
yielded
to
any
undue
attraction
i
am
not
enthusiastic
or
passionate
by
nature
my
judgment
is
more
powerful
than
my
instinct
my
curiosity
than
my
appetite
my
fancy
than
my
perseverance
i
am
essentially
nothing
more
than
a
man
that
is
delicate
intelligent
and
hard
to
please
in
his
enjoyments
i
have
loved
the
things
of
this
life
without
ever
allowing
myself
to
become
greatly
attached
to
them
with
the
perceptions
of
an
expert
who
sips
and
does
not
suffer
himself
to
become
surfeited
who
knows
better
than
to
lose
his
head
i
submit
everything
to
the
test
of
reason
and
generally
i
analyze
my
likings
too
severely
to
submit
to
them
blindly
that
is
even
my
great
defect
the
only
cause
of
my
weakness
and
now
that
woman
has
taken
possession
of
me
in
spite
of
myself
in
spite
of
my
fears
and
of
my
knowledge
of
her
and
she
retains
her
hold
as
if
she
had
plucked
away
one
by
one
all
the
different
aspirations
that
existed
in
me
that
may
be
the
case
those
aspirations
of
mine
went
out
toward
inanimate
objects
toward
nature
that
entices
and
softens
me
toward
music
which
is
a
sort
of
ideal
caress
toward
reflection
which
is
the
delicate
feasting
of
the
mind
toward
everything
on
earth
that
is
beautiful
and
agreeable
then
i
met
a
creature
who
collected
and
concentrated
all
my
somewhat
fickle
and
fluctuating
likings
and
directing
them
toward
herself
converted
them
into
love
charming
and
beautiful
she
pleased
my
eyes
bright
intelligent
and
witty
she
pleased
my
mind
and
she
pleased
my
heart
by
the
mysterious
charm
of
her
contact
and
her
presence
and
by
the
secret
and
irresistible
emanation
from
her
personality
until
all
these
things
enslaved
me
as
the
perfume
of
certain
flowers
intoxicates
she
has
taken
the
place
of
everything
for
me
for
i
no
longer
have
any
aspirations
i
no
longer
wish
or
care
for
anything
in
other
days
how
my
feelings
would
have
thrilled
and
started
in
this
forest
that
is
putting
forth
its
new
life
i
see
nothing
of
it
i
am
regardless
of
it
i
am
still
at
that
woman
side
whom
i
desire
to
love
no
more
come
i
must
kill
these
ideas
by
physical
fatigue
unless
i
do
i
shall
never
get
well
he
arose
descended
the
rocky
hillside
and
resumed
his
walk
with
long
strides
but
still
the
haunting
presence
crushed
him
as
if
it
had
been
a
burden
that
he
was
bearing
on
his
back
he
went
on
constantly
increasing
his
speed
now
and
then
encountering
a
brief
sensation
of
comfort
at
the
sight
of
the
sunlight
piercing
through
the
foliage
or
at
a
breath
of
perfumed
air
from
some
grove
of
resinous
which
inspired
in
him
a
presentiment
of
distant
consolation
suddenly
he
came
to
a
halt
i
am
not
walking
any
longer
he
said
i
am
flying
from
something
indeed
he
was
flying
straight
ahead
he
cared
not
where
pursued
by
the
agony
of
his
love
then
he
started
on
again
at
a
more
reasonable
speed
the
appearance
of
the
forest
was
undergoing
a
change
the
growth
was
denser
and
the
shadows
deeper
for
he
was
coming
to
the
warmer
portions
of
it
to
the
beautiful
region
of
the
beeches
no
sensation
of
winter
lingered
there
it
was
wondrous
spring
that
seemed
to
have
been
the
birth
of
a
night
so
young
and
fresh
was
everything
mariolle
made
his
way
among
the
thickets
beneath
the
gigantic
trees
that
towered
above
him
higher
and
higher
still
and
in
this
way
he
went
on
for
a
long
time
an
hour
two
hours
pushing
his
way
through
the
branches
through
the
countless
multitudes
of
little
shining
leaves
bright
with
their
varnish
of
new
sap
the
heavens
were
quite
concealed
by
the
immense
dome
of
verdure
supported
on
its
lofty
columns
now
perpendicular
now
leaning
now
of
a
whitish
hue
now
dark
beneath
the
black
moss
that
drew
its
nourishment
from
the
bark
thus
they
towered
stretching
away
indefinitely
in
the
distance
one
behind
the
other
lording
it
over
the
bushy
young
copses
that
grew
in
confused
tangles
at
their
feet
and
wrapping
them
in
dense
shadow
through
which
in
places
poured
floods
of
vivid
sunlight
the
golden
rain
streamed
down
through
all
this
luxuriant
growth
until
the
wood
no
longer
remained
a
wood
but
became
a
brilliant
sea
of
verdure
illumined
by
yellow
rays
mariolle
stopped
seized
with
an
ineffable
surprise
where
was
he
was
he
in
a
forest
or
had
he
descended
to
the
bottom
of
a
sea
a
sea
of
leaves
and
light
an
ocean
of
green
resplendency
he
felt
better
more
tranquil
more
remote
more
hidden
from
his
misery
and
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
red
carpet
of
dead
leaves
that
these
trees
do
not
cast
until
they
are
ready
to
put
on
their
new
garments
rejoicing
in
the
cool
contact
of
the
earth
and
the
pure
sweetness
of
the
air
he
was
soon
conscious
of
a
wish
vague
at
first
but
soon
becoming
more
defined
not
to
be
alone
in
this
charming
spot
and
he
said
to
himself
ah
if
she
were
only
here
at
my
side
he
suddenly
remembered
mont
and
recollecting
how
different
she
had
been
down
there
to
what
she
was
in
paris
how
her
affection
had
blossomed
out
in
the
open
air
before
the
yellow
sands
he
thought
that
on
that
day
she
had
surely
loved
him
a
little
for
a
few
hours
yes
surely
on
the
road
where
they
had
watched
the
receding
tide
in
the
cloisters
where
murmuring
his
name
andré
she
had
seemed
to
say
i
am
yours
and
on
the
madman
path
where
he
had
almost
borne
her
through
space
she
had
felt
an
impulsion
toward
him
that
had
never
returned
since
she
placed
her
foot
the
foot
of
a
coquette
on
the
pavement
of
paris
he
continued
to
yield
himself
to
his
mournful
reveries
still
stretched
at
length
upon
his
back
his
look
lost
among
the
gold
and
green
of
the
and
little
by
little
his
eyes
closed
weighed
down
with
sleep
and
the
tranquillity
that
reigned
among
the
trees
when
he
awoke
he
saw
that
it
was
past
two
of
the
afternoon
when
he
arose
and
proceeded
on
his
way
he
felt
less
sad
less
ailing
at
length
he
emerged
from
the
thickness
of
the
wood
and
came
to
a
great
open
space
where
six
broad
avenues
converged
and
then
stretched
away
and
lost
themselves
in
the
leafy
transparent
distance
a
signboard
told
him
that
the
name
of
the
locality
was
le
it
was
indeed
the
capital
of
this
royal
country
of
the
beeches
a
carriage
passed
and
as
it
was
empty
and
disengaged
mariolle
took
it
and
ordered
the
driver
to
take
him
to
marlotte
whence
he
could
make
his
way
to
montigny
after
getting
something
to
eat
at
the
inn
for
he
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
he
remembered
that
he
had
seen
this
establishment
which
was
only
recently
opened
the
day
before
the
hotel
corot
it
was
called
an
artistic
in
style
of
decoration
modeled
on
the
chat
noir
in
paris
his
driver
set
him
down
there
and
he
passed
through
an
open
door
into
a
vast
room
where
tables
and
uncomfortable
benches
seemed
to
be
awaiting
drinkers
of
a
past
century
at
the
far
end
a
woman
a
young
waitress
no
doubt
was
standing
on
top
of
a
little
folding
ladder
fastening
some
old
plates
to
nails
that
were
driven
in
the
wall
and
seemed
nearly
beyond
her
reach
now
raising
herself
on
tiptoe
on
both
feet
now
on
one
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
against
the
wall
while
the
other
held
the
plate
she
reached
up
with
pretty
and
adroit
movements
for
her
figure
was
pleasing
and
the
undulating
lines
from
wrist
to
ankle
assumed
changing
forms
of
grace
at
every
fresh
posture
as
her
back
was
toward
him
she
had
been
unaware
of
mariolle
entrance
who
stopped
to
watch
her
he
thought
of
prédolé
and
his
it
is
a
pretty
picture
though
he
said
to
himself
she
is
very
graceful
that
little
girl
he
gave
a
little
cough
she
was
so
startled
that
she
came
near
falling
but
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
her
she
jumped
down
from
her
ladder
as
lightly
as
a
rope
dancer
and
came
to
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
her
face
what
will
monsieur
have
she
inquired
breakfast
mademoiselle
she
ventured
to
say
it
should
be
dinner
rather
for
it
is
half
past
three
we
will
call
it
dinner
if
you
like
i
lost
myself
in
the
forest
then
she
told
him
what
dishes
there
were
ready
he
made
his
selection
and
took
a
seat
she
went
away
to
give
the
order
returning
shortly
to
set
the
table
for
him
he
watched
her
closely
as
she
bustled
around
the
table
she
was
pretty
and
very
neat
in
her
attire
she
had
a
spry
little
air
that
was
very
pleasant
to
behold
in
her
working
dress
with
skirt
pinned
up
sleeves
rolled
back
and
neck
exposed
and
her
corset
fitted
closely
to
her
pretty
form
of
which
she
had
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
her
face
was
rather
red
painted
by
exposure
to
the
open
air
and
it
seemed
somewhat
too
fat
and
puffy
but
it
was
as
fresh
as
a
rose
with
fine
bright
brown
eyes
a
large
mouth
with
its
complement
of
handsome
teeth
and
chestnut
hair
that
revealed
by
its
abundance
the
healthy
vigor
of
this
strong
young
frame
she
brought
radishes
and
bread
and
butter
and
he
began
to
eat
ceasing
to
pay
attention
to
the
attendant
he
called
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
drank
the
whole
of
it
as
he
did
two
glasses
of
kummel
after
his
coffee
and
as
his
stomach
was
empty
he
had
taken
nothing
before
he
left
his
house
but
a
little
bread
and
cold
meat
he
soon
felt
a
comforting
feeling
of
tipsiness
stealing
over
him
that
he
mistook
for
oblivion
his
griefs
and
sorrows
were
diluted
and
tempered
by
the
sparkling
wine
which
in
so
short
a
time
had
transformed
the
torments
of
his
heart
into
insensibility
he
walked
slowly
back
to
montigny
and
being
very
tired
and
sleepy
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
falling
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
he
awoke
after
a
while
however
in
the
dense
darkness
ill
at
ease
and
disquieted
as
if
a
nightmare
that
had
left
him
for
an
hour
or
two
had
furtively
reappeared
at
his
bedside
to
murder
sleep
she
was
there
she
mme
de
burne
back
again
roaming
about
his
bed
and
accompanied
still
by
de
bernhaus
come
he
said
it
must
be
that
i
am
jealous
what
is
the
reason
of
it
why
was
he
jealous
he
quickly
told
himself
why
notwithstanding
all
his
doubts
and
fears
he
knew
that
as
long
as
he
had
been
her
lover
she
had
been
faithful
to
him
faithful
indeed
without
tenderness
and
without
transports
but
with
a
loyal
strength
of
resolution
now
however
he
had
broken
it
all
off
and
it
was
ended
he
had
restored
her
freedom
to
her
would
she
remain
without
a
yes
doubtless
for
a
while
and
then
this
very
fidelity
that
she
had
observed
toward
him
up
to
the
present
moment
a
fidelity
beyond
the
reach
of
suspicion
was
it
not
due
to
the
feeling
that
if
she
left
him
mariolle
because
she
was
tired
of
him
she
would
some
day
sooner
or
later
have
to
take
some
one
to
fill
his
place
not
from
passion
but
from
weariness
of
being
alone
is
it
not
true
that
lovers
often
owe
their
long
lease
of
favor
simply
to
the
dread
of
an
unknown
successor
and
then
to
dismiss
one
lover
and
take
up
with
another
would
not
have
seemed
the
right
thing
to
such
a
woman
she
was
too
intelligent
indeed
to
bow
to
social
prejudices
but
was
gifted
with
a
delicate
sense
of
moral
purity
that
kept
her
from
real
indelicacies
she
was
a
worldly
philosopher
and
not
a
prudish
and
while
she
would
not
have
quailed
at
the
idea
of
a
secret
attachment
her
nature
would
have
revolted
at
the
thought
of
a
succession
of
lovers
he
had
given
her
her
freedom
and
now
now
most
certainly
she
would
take
up
with
some
one
else
and
that
some
one
would
be
the
comte
de
bernhaus
he
was
sure
of
it
and
the
thought
was
now
affording
him
inexpressible
suffering
why
had
he
left
her
she
had
been
faithful
a
good
friend
to
him
charming
in
every
way
why
was
it
because
he
was
a
brutal
sensualist
who
could
not
separate
true
love
from
its
physical
transports
was
that
it
yes
but
there
was
something
besides
he
had
fled
from
the
pain
of
not
being
loved
as
he
loved
from
the
cruel
feeling
that
he
did
not
receive
an
equivalent
return
for
the
warmth
of
his
kisses
an
incurable
affliction
from
which
his
heart
grievously
smitten
would
perhaps
never
recover
he
looked
forward
with
dread
to
the
prospect
of
enduring
for
years
the
torments
that
he
had
been
anticipating
for
a
few
months
and
suffering
for
a
few
weeks
in
accordance
with
his
nature
he
had
weakly
recoiled
before
this
prospect
just
as
he
had
recoiled
all
his
life
long
before
any
effort
that
called
for
resolution
it
followed
that
he
was
incapable
of
carrying
anything
to
its
conclusion
of
throwing
himself
heart
and
soul
into
such
a
passion
as
one
develops
for
a
science
or
an
art
for
it
is
impossible
perhaps
to
have
loved
greatly
without
having
suffered
greatly
until
daylight
he
pursued
this
train
of
thought
which
tore
him
like
wild
horses
then
he
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
a
fisherman
was
casting
his
net
near
the
little
dam
and
when
he
withdrew
it
from
the
water
that
flashed
and
eddied
in
the
sunlight
and
spread
it
on
the
deck
of
his
small
boat
the
little
fishes
danced
among
the
meshes
like
animated
silver
mariolle
agitation
subsided
little
by
little
in
the
balmy
freshness
of
the
early
morning
air
the
cool
mist
that
rose
from
the
miniature
waterfall
about
which
faint
rainbows
fluttered
and
the
stream
that
ran
at
his
feet
in
rapid
and
ceaseless
current
carried
off
with
them
a
portion
of
his
sorrow
he
said
to
himself
truly
i
have
done
the
right
thing
i
should
have
been
too
unhappy
otherwise
then
he
returned
to
the
house
and
taking
possession
of
a
hammock
that
he
had
noticed
in
the
vestibule
he
made
it
fast
between
two
of
the
lindens
and
throwing
himself
into
it
endeavored
to
drive
away
reflection
by
fixing
his
eyes
and
thoughts
upon
the
flowing
stream
thus
he
idled
away
the
time
until
the
hour
of
breakfast
in
an
agreeable
torpor
a
physical
sensation
of
that
communicated
itself
to
the
mind
and
he
protracted
the
meal
as
much
as
possible
that
he
might
have
some
occupation
for
the
dragging
minutes
there
was
one
thing
however
that
he
looked
forward
to
with
eager
expectation
and
that
was
his
mail
he
had
telegraphed
to
paris
and
written
to
fontainebleau
to
have
his
letters
forwarded
but
had
received
nothing
and
the
sensation
of
being
entirely
abandoned
was
beginning
to
be
oppressive
why
he
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
there
would
be
anything
particularly
pleasing
or
comforting
for
him
in
the
little
black
box
that
the
carrier
bore
slung
at
his
side
nothing
beyond
useless
invitations
and
unmeaning
communications
why
then
should
he
long
for
letters
of
whose
contents
he
knew
nothing
as
if
the
salvation
of
his
soul
depended
on
them
was
it
not
that
there
lay
concealed
in
his
heart
the
vainglorious
expectation
that
she
would
write
to
him
he
asked
one
of
his
old
women
at
what
time
does
the
mail
arrive
at
noon
monsieur
it
was
just
midday
and
he
listened
with
increased
attention
to
the
noises
that
reached
him
from
outdoors
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
brought
him
to
his
feet
the
messenger
brought
him
only
the
newspapers
and
three
unimportant
letters
mariolle
glanced
over
the
journals
until
he
was
tired
and
went
out
what
should
he
do
he
went
to
the
hammock
and
lay
down
in
it
but
after
half
an
hour
of
that
he
experienced
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
go
somewhere
else
the
forest
yes
the
forest
was
very
pleasant
but
then
the
solitude
there
was
even
deeper
than
it
was
in
his
house
much
deeper
than
it
was
in
the
village
where
there
were
at
least
some
signs
of
life
now
and
then
and
the
silence
and
loneliness
of
all
those
trees
and
leaves
filled
his
mind
with
sadness
and
regrets
steeping
him
more
deeply
still
in
wretchedness
he
mentally
reviewed
his
long
walk
of
the
day
before
and
when
he
came
to
the
little
waitress
of
the
hotel
corot
he
said
to
himself
i
have
it
i
will
go
and
dine
there
the
idea
did
him
good
it
was
something
to
occupy
him
a
means
of
killing
two
or
three
hours
and
he
set
out
forthwith
the
long
village
street
stretched
straight
away
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
between
two
rows
of
low
white
houses
some
of
them
standing
boldly
up
with
their
fronts
close
to
the
road
others
more
retiring
situated
in
a
garden
where
there
was
a
in
bloom
and
chickens
scratching
over
where
wooden
stairways
in
the
open
air
climbed
to
doors
cut
in
the
wall
peasants
were
at
work
before
their
dwellings
lazily
fulfilling
their
domestic
duties
an
old
woman
bent
with
age
and
with
threads
of
gray
in
her
yellow
hair
for
country
folk
rarely
have
white
hair
passed
close
to
him
a
ragged
jacket
upon
her
shoulders
and
her
lean
and
sinewy
legs
covered
by
a
woolen
petticoat
that
failed
to
conceal
the
angles
and
protuberances
of
her
frame
she
was
looking
aimlessly
before
her
with
expressionless
eyes
eyes
that
had
never
looked
on
other
objects
than
those
that
might
be
of
use
to
her
in
her
poor
existence
another
woman
younger
than
this
one
was
hanging
out
the
family
wash
before
her
door
the
lifting
of
her
skirt
as
she
raised
her
arms
aloft
disclosed
to
view
thick
coarse
ankles
incased
in
blue
knitted
stockings
with
great
projecting
fleshless
bones
while
the
breast
and
shoulders
flat
and
broad
as
those
of
a
man
told
of
a
body
whose
form
must
have
been
horrible
to
behold
mariolle
thought
they
are
women
those
scarecrows
are
women
the
vision
of
mme
de
burne
arose
before
his
eyes
he
beheld
her
in
all
her
elegance
and
beauty
the
perfection
of
the
human
female
form
coquettish
and
adorned
to
meet
the
looks
of
man
and
again
he
smarted
with
the
sorrow
of
an
irreparable
loss
then
he
walked
on
more
quickly
to
shake
himself
free
of
this
impression
when
he
reached
the
inn
at
marlotte
the
little
waitress
recognized
him
immediately
and
accosted
him
almost
familiarly
good
day
monsieur
good
day
mademoiselle
do
you
wish
something
to
drink
yes
to
begin
with
then
i
will
have
dinner
they
discussed
the
question
of
what
he
should
drink
in
the
first
place
and
what
he
should
eat
subsequently
he
asked
her
advice
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
her
talk
for
she
had
a
nice
way
of
expressing
herself
she
had
a
short
little
parisian
accent
and
her
speech
was
as
unconstrained
as
was
her
movements
he
thought
as
he
listened
the
little
girl
is
quite
agreeable
she
seems
to
me
to
have
a
bit
of
the
about
her
are
you
a
parisian
he
inquired
yes
sir
have
you
been
here
long
two
weeks
sir
and
do
you
like
it
not
very
well
so
far
but
it
is
too
soon
to
tell
and
then
i
was
tired
of
the
air
of
paris
and
the
country
has
done
me
good
that
is
why
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
here
then
i
shall
bring
you
a
vermouth
monsieur
yes
mademoiselle
and
tell
the
cook
to
be
careful
and
pay
attention
to
my
dinner
never
fear
monsieur
after
she
had
gone
away
he
went
into
the
garden
of
the
hotel
and
took
a
seat
in
an
arbor
where
his
vermouth
was
served
he
remained
there
all
the
rest
of
the
day
listening
to
a
blackbird
whistling
in
its
cage
and
watching
the
little
waitress
in
her
goings
and
comings
she
played
the
coquette
and
put
on
her
sweetest
looks
for
the
gentleman
for
she
had
not
failed
to
observe
that
he
found
her
to
his
liking
he
went
away
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
after
drinking
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
dispel
gloom
but
the
darkness
of
the
way
and
the
coolness
of
the
night
air
quickly
dissipated
his
incipient
tipsiness
and
sorrow
again
took
possession
of
his
devoted
soul
he
thought
what
am
i
to
do
shall
i
remain
here
shall
i
be
condemned
for
long
to
drag
out
this
desolate
way
of
living
it
was
very
late
when
he
got
to
sleep
the
next
morning
he
again
installed
himself
in
the
hammock
and
all
at
once
the
sight
of
a
man
casting
his
net
inspired
him
with
the
idea
of
going
fishing
the
grocer
from
whom
he
bought
his
lines
gave
him
some
instructions
upon
the
soothing
sport
and
even
offered
to
go
with
him
and
act
as
his
guide
upon
his
first
attempt
the
offer
was
accepted
and
between
nine
and
noon
mariolle
succeeded
by
dint
of
vigorous
exertion
and
unintermitting
patience
in
capturing
three
small
fish
when
he
had
dispatched
his
breakfast
he
took
up
his
march
again
for
marlotte
why
to
kill
time
of
course
the
little
waitress
began
to
laugh
when
she
saw
him
coming
amused
by
her
recognition
of
him
he
smiled
back
at
her
and
tried
to
engage
her
in
conversation
she
was
more
familiar
than
she
had
been
the
preceding
day
and
met
him
halfway
her
name
was
elisabeth
ledru
her
mother
who
took
in
dressmaking
had
died
the
year
before
then
the
husband
an
accountant
by
profession
always
drunk
and
out
of
work
who
had
lived
on
the
little
earnings
of
his
wife
and
daughter
disappeared
for
the
girl
could
not
support
two
persons
though
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
garret
room
and
sewed
all
day
long
tiring
of
her
lonely
occupation
after
a
while
she
got
a
position
as
waitress
in
a
remained
there
a
year
and
as
the
hard
work
had
worn
her
down
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
corot
at
marlotte
upon
whom
she
had
waited
at
times
engaged
her
for
the
summer
with
two
other
girls
who
were
to
come
down
a
little
later
on
it
was
evident
that
the
proprietor
knew
how
to
attract
customers
her
little
story
pleased
mariolle
and
by
treating
her
with
respect
and
asking
her
a
few
discriminating
questions
he
succeeded
in
eliciting
from
her
many
interesting
details
of
this
poor
dismal
home
that
had
been
laid
in
ruins
by
a
drunken
father
she
poor
homeless
wandering
creature
that
she
was
gay
and
cheerful
because
she
could
not
help
it
being
young
and
feeling
that
the
interest
that
this
stranger
took
in
her
was
unfeigned
talked
to
him
with
confidence
with
that
expansiveness
of
soul
that
she
could
no
more
restrain
than
she
could
restrain
the
agile
movements
of
her
limbs
when
she
had
finished
he
asked
her
and
do
you
expect
to
be
a
waitress
all
your
life
i
could
not
answer
that
question
monsieur
how
can
i
tell
what
may
happen
to
me
and
yet
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
the
future
she
had
assumed
a
thoughtful
air
that
did
not
linger
long
upon
her
features
then
she
replied
i
suppose
that
i
shall
have
to
take
whatever
comes
to
me
so
much
the
worse
they
parted
very
good
friends
after
a
few
days
he
returned
then
again
and
soon
he
began
to
go
there
frequently
finding
a
vague
distraction
in
the
girl
conversation
and
that
her
artless
prattle
helped
him
somewhat
to
forget
his
grief
when
he
returned
on
foot
to
montigny
in
the
evening
however
he
had
terrible
fits
of
despair
as
he
thought
of
mme
de
burne
his
heart
became
a
little
lighter
with
the
morning
sun
but
with
the
night
his
bitter
regrets
and
fierce
jealousy
closed
in
on
him
again
he
had
no
intelligence
he
had
written
to
no
one
and
had
received
letters
from
no
one
then
alone
with
his
thoughts
upon
the
dark
road
his
imagination
would
picture
the
progress
of
the
approaching
that
he
had
foreseen
between
his
quondam
mistress
and
the
comte
de
bernhaus
this
had
now
become
a
settled
idea
with
him
and
fixed
itself
more
firmly
in
his
mind
every
day
that
man
he
thought
will
be
to
her
just
what
she
requires
a
distinguished
assiduous
unexacting
lover
contented
and
happy
to
be
the
chosen
one
of
this
superlatively
delicious
coquette
he
compared
him
with
himself
the
other
most
certainly
would
not
behave
as
he
had
would
not
be
guilty
of
that
tiresome
impatience
and
of
that
insatiable
thirst
for
a
return
of
his
affection
that
had
been
the
destruction
of
their
amorous
understanding
he
was
a
very
discreet
pliant
and
man
of
the
world
and
would
manage
to
get
along
and
content
himself
with
but
little
for
he
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
the
class
of
impassioned
mortals
on
one
of
andré
mariolle
visits
to
marlotte
one
day
he
beheld
two
bearded
young
fellows
in
the
other
arbor
of
the
hotel
corot
smoking
pipes
and
wearing
scotch
caps
on
their
heads
the
proprietor
a
big
man
came
forward
to
pay
his
respects
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
for
he
had
an
interested
liking
for
this
faithful
patron
of
his
and
said
to
him
i
have
two
new
customers
since
yesterday
two
painters
those
gentlemen
sitting
there
yes
they
are
beginning
to
be
heard
of
one
of
them
got
a
medal
last
year
and
having
told
all
that
he
knew
about
the
embryo
artists
he
asked
what
will
you
take
monsieur
mariolle
you
may
send
me
out
a
vermouth
as
usual
the
proprietor
went
away
and
soon
elisabeth
appeared
bringing
the
salver
the
glass
the
and
the
bottle
whereupon
one
of
the
painters
called
to
her
well
little
one
are
we
angry
still
she
did
not
answer
and
when
she
approached
mariolle
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
red
you
have
been
crying
he
said
yes
a
little
she
simply
replied
what
was
the
matter
those
two
gentlemen
there
behaved
rudely
to
me
what
did
they
do
to
you
they
took
me
for
a
bad
character
did
you
complain
to
the
proprietor
she
gave
a
sorrowful
shrug
of
the
shoulders
oh
monsieur
the
proprietor
i
know
what
he
is
now
the
proprietor
mariolle
was
touched
and
a
little
angry
he
said
to
her
tell
me
what
it
was
all
about
she
told
him
of
the
brutal
conduct
of
the
two
painters
immediately
upon
their
arrival
the
night
before
and
then
began
to
cry
again
asking
what
she
was
to
do
alone
in
the
country
and
without
friends
or
relatives
money
or
protection
mariolle
suddenly
said
to
her
will
you
enter
my
service
you
shall
be
well
treated
in
my
house
and
when
i
return
to
paris
you
will
be
free
to
do
what
you
please
she
looked
him
in
the
face
with
questioning
eyes
and
then
quickly
replied
i
will
monsieur
how
much
are
you
earning
here
sixty
francs
a
month
she
added
rather
uneasily
and
i
have
my
share
of
the
besides
that
makes
it
about
seventy
i
will
pay
you
a
hundred
she
repeated
in
astonishment
a
hundred
francs
a
month
yes
is
that
enough
i
should
think
that
it
was
enough
all
that
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
wait
on
me
take
care
of
my
clothes
and
linen
and
attend
to
my
room
it
is
a
bargain
monsieur
when
will
you
come
if
you
wish
after
what
has
happened
here
i
will
go
to
the
mayor
and
will
leave
whether
they
are
willing
or
not
mariolle
took
two
louis
from
his
pocket
and
handed
them
to
her
there
the
money
to
bind
our
bargain
a
look
of
joy
flashed
across
her
face
and
she
said
in
a
tone
of
decision
i
will
be
at
your
house
before
midday

chapter

consolation
elisabeth
came
to
montigny
next
day
attended
by
a
countryman
with
her
trunk
on
a
wheelbarrow
mariolle
had
made
a
generous
settlement
with
one
of
his
old
women
and
got
rid
of
her
and
the
newcomer
took
possession
of
a
small
room
on
the
top
floor
adjoining
that
of
the
cook
she
was
quite
different
from
what
she
had
been
at
marlotte
when
she
presented
herself
before
her
new
master
less
effusive
more
respectful
more
she
was
now
the
servant
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
she
had
been
almost
an
humble
friend
beneath
the
arbor
of
the
inn
he
told
her
in
a
few
words
what
she
would
have
to
do
she
listened
attentively
went
and
took
possession
of
her
room
and
then
entered
upon
her
new
service
a
week
passed
and
brought
no
noticeable
change
in
the
state
of
mariolle
feelings
the
only
difference
was
that
he
remained
at
home
more
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
for
he
had
nothing
to
attract
him
to
marlotte
and
his
house
seemed
less
dismal
to
him
than
at
first
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
was
subsiding
a
little
as
all
storms
subside
after
a
while
but
in
place
of
this
aching
wound
there
was
arising
in
him
a
settled
melancholy
one
of
those
sorrows
that
are
like
chronic
and
lingering
maladies
and
sometimes
end
in
death
his
former
liveliness
of
mind
and
body
his
mental
activity
his
interests
in
the
pursuits
that
had
served
to
occupy
and
amuse
him
hitherto
were
all
dead
and
their
place
had
been
taken
by
a
universal
disgust
and
an
invincible
torpor
that
left
him
without
even
strength
of
will
to
get
up
and
go
out
of
doors
he
no
longer
left
his
house
passing
from
the
salon
to
the
hammock
and
from
the
hammock
to
the
salon
and
his
chief
distraction
consisted
in
watching
the
current
of
the
loing
as
it
flowed
by
the
terrace
and
the
fisherman
casting
his
net
when
the
reserve
of
the
first
few
days
had
begun
to
wear
off
elisabeth
gradually
grew
a
little
bolder
and
remarking
with
her
keen
feminine
instinct
the
constant
dejection
of
her
employer
she
would
say
to
him
when
the
other
servant
was
not
by
monsieur
finds
his
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
he
would
answer
resignedly
yes
pretty
heavy
monsieur
should
go
for
a
walk
that
would
not
do
me
any
good
she
quietly
did
many
little
unassuming
things
for
his
pleasure
and
comfort
every
morning
when
he
came
into
his
he
found
it
filled
with
flowers
and
smelling
as
sweetly
as
a
conservatory
elisabeth
must
surely
have
enlisted
all
the
boys
in
the
village
to
bring
her
primroses
violets
and
buttercups
from
the
forest
as
well
as
putting
under
contribution
the
small
gardens
where
the
peasant
girls
tended
their
few
plants
at
evening
in
his
loneliness
and
distress
he
was
grateful
for
her
kind
thoughtfulness
and
her
unobtrusive
desire
to
please
him
in
these
small
ways
it
also
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
growing
prettier
more
refined
in
her
appearance
and
that
she
devoted
more
attention
to
the
care
of
her
person
one
day
when
she
was
handing
him
a
cup
of
tea
he
noticed
that
her
hands
were
no
longer
the
hands
of
a
servant
but
of
a
lady
with
clean
nails
quite
irreproachable
on
another
occasion
he
observed
that
the
shoes
that
she
wore
were
almost
elegant
in
shape
and
material
then
she
had
gone
up
to
her
room
one
afternoon
and
come
down
wearing
a
delightful
little
gray
dress
quite
simple
and
in
perfect
taste
hallo
he
exclaimed
as
he
saw
her
how
dressy
you
are
getting
to
be
elisabeth
she
blushed
up
to
the
whites
of
her
eyes
what
i
monsieur
why
no
i
dress
a
little
better
because
i
have
more
money
where
did
you
buy
that
dress
that
you
have
on
i
made
it
myself
monsieur
you
made
it
when
i
always
see
you
busy
at
work
about
the
house
during
the
day
why
during
my
evenings
monsieur
but
where
did
you
get
the
stuff
and
who
cut
it
for
you
she
told
him
that
the
shopkeeper
at
montigny
had
brought
her
some
samples
from
fontainebleau
that
she
had
made
her
selection
from
them
and
paid
for
the
goods
out
of
the
two
louis
that
he
had
paid
her
as
advanced
wages
the
cutting
and
fitting
had
not
troubled
her
at
all
for
she
and
her
mother
had
worked
four
years
for
a
clothing
house
he
could
not
resist
telling
her
it
is
very
becoming
to
you
you
look
very
pretty
in
it
and
she
had
to
blush
again
this
time
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
when
she
had
left
the
room
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
she
is
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
me
he
reflected
on
it
hesitated
doubted
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
after
all
it
might
be
possible
he
had
been
kind
and
compassionate
toward
her
had
assisted
her
and
been
almost
her
friend
there
would
be
nothing
very
surprising
in
this
little
girl
being
smitten
with
the
master
who
had
been
so
good
to
her
the
idea
did
not
strike
him
very
disagreeably
moreover
for
she
was
really
very
presentable
and
retained
nothing
of
the
appearance
of
a
servant
about
her
he
experienced
a
flattering
feeling
of
consolation
and
his
masculine
vanity
that
had
been
so
cruelly
wounded
and
trampled
on
and
crushed
by
another
woman
felt
comforted
it
was
a
compensation
trivial
and
unnoteworthy
though
it
might
be
it
was
a
compensation
for
when
love
comes
to
a
man
unsought
no
matter
whence
it
comes
it
is
because
that
man
possesses
the
capacity
of
inspiring
it
his
unconscious
selfishness
was
also
gratified
by
it
it
would
occupy
his
attention
and
do
him
a
little
good
perhaps
to
watch
this
young
heart
opening
and
beating
for
him
the
thought
never
occurred
to
him
of
sending
the
child
away
of
rescuing
her
from
the
peril
from
which
he
himself
was
suffering
so
cruelly
of
having
more
pity
for
her
than
others
had
showed
toward
him
for
compassion
is
never
an
ingredient
that
enters
into
sentimental
conquests
so
he
continued
his
observations
and
soon
saw
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
petty
details
revealed
it
to
him
more
clearly
day
by
day
as
she
came
near
him
one
morning
while
waiting
on
him
at
table
he
smelled
on
her
clothing
an
odor
of
perfumery
villainous
cheap
perfumery
from
the
village
shopkeeper
doubtless
or
the
druggist
so
he
presented
her
with
a
bottle
of
cyprus
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
using
for
a
long
time
and
of
which
he
always
carried
a
supply
about
with
him
he
also
gave
her
fine
soaps
and
he
thus
lent
his
assistance
to
the
transformation
that
was
becoming
more
apparent
every
day
watching
it
meantime
with
a
pleased
and
curious
eye
while
remaining
his
faithful
and
respectful
servant
she
was
thus
becoming
a
woman
in
whom
the
coquettish
instincts
of
her
sex
were
artlessly
developing
themselves
he
on
his
part
was
imperceptibly
becoming
attached
to
her
she
inspired
him
at
the
same
time
with
amusement
and
gratitude
he
trifled
with
this
dawning
tenderness
as
one
trifles
in
his
hours
of
melancholy
with
anything
that
can
divert
his
mind
he
was
conscious
of
no
other
emotion
toward
her
than
that
undefined
desire
which
impels
every
man
toward
a
prepossessing
woman
even
if
she
be
a
pretty
servant
or
a
peasant
maiden
with
the
form
of
a
goddess
a
sort
of
rustic
venus
he
felt
himself
drawn
to
her
more
than
all
else
by
the
womanliness
that
he
now
found
in
her
he
felt
the
need
of
that
an
undefined
and
irresistible
need
bequeathed
to
him
by
that
other
one
the
woman
whom
he
loved
who
had
first
awakened
in
him
that
invincible
and
mysterious
fondness
for
the
nature
the
companionship
the
contact
of
women
for
the
subtle
aroma
ideal
or
sensual
that
every
beautiful
creature
whether
of
the
people
or
of
the
upper
class
whether
a
lethargic
sensual
native
of
the
orient
with
great
black
eyes
or
a
daughter
of
the
north
inspires
in
men
in
whom
still
survives
the
immemorial
attraction
of
femininity
these
gentle
loving
and
unceasing
attentions
that
were
felt
rather
than
seen
wrapped
his
wound
in
a
sort
of
soft
protecting
envelope
that
shielded
it
to
some
extent
from
its
recurrent
attacks
of
suffering
which
did
return
nevertheless
like
flies
to
a
raw
sore
he
was
made
especially
impatient
by
the
absence
of
all
news
for
his
friends
had
religiously
respected
his
request
not
to
divulge
his
address
now
and
then
he
would
see
massival
or
lamarthe
name
in
the
newspapers
among
those
who
had
been
present
at
some
great
dinner
or
ceremonial
and
one
day
he
saw
mme
de
burne
who
was
mentioned
as
being
one
of
the
most
elegant
the
prettiest
and
best
dressed
of
the
women
who
were
at
the
ball
at
the
austrian
embassy
it
sent
a
trembling
through
him
from
head
to
foot
the
name
of
the
comte
de
bernhaus
appeared
a
few
lines
further
down
and
that
day
mariolle
jealousy
returned
and
wrung
his
heart
until
night
the
suspected
was
no
longer
subject
for
doubt
for
him
now
it
was
one
of
those
imaginary
convictions
that
are
even
more
torturing
than
reality
for
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
them
and
they
leave
a
wound
that
hardly
ever
heals
no
longer
able
to
endure
this
state
of
ignorance
and
uncertainty
he
determined
to
write
to
lamarthe
who
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
him
to
divine
the
wretchedness
of
his
soul
and
would
be
likely
to
afford
him
some
clew
as
to
the
justice
of
his
suspicions
even
without
being
directly
questioned
on
the
subject
one
evening
therefore
he
sat
down
and
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
concocted
a
long
artful
letter
full
of
vague
sadness
and
poetical
allusions
to
the
delights
of
early
spring
in
the
country
and
veiled
requests
for
information
when
he
got
his
mail
four
days
later
he
recognized
at
the
very
first
glance
the
novelist
firm
upright
handwriting
lamarthe
sent
him
a
thousand
items
of
news
that
were
of
great
importance
to
his
jealous
eyes
without
laying
more
stress
upon
mme
de
burne
and
bernhaus
than
upon
any
other
of
the
crowd
of
people
whom
he
mentioned
he
seemed
to
place
them
in
the
foreground
by
one
of
those
tricks
of
style
characteristic
of
him
which
led
the
attention
to
just
the
point
where
he
wished
to
lead
it
without
revealing
his
design
the
impression
that
this
letter
taken
as
a
whole
left
upon
mariolle
was
that
his
suspicions
were
at
least
not
destitute
of
foundation
his
fears
would
be
realized
if
they
had
not
been
yesterday
his
former
mistress
was
always
the
same
leading
the
same
busy
brilliant
fashionable
life
he
had
been
the
subject
of
some
talk
after
his
disappearance
as
the
world
always
talks
of
people
who
have
disappeared
with
lukewarm
curiosity
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
he
remained
in
his
hammock
until
nightfall
then
he
could
eat
no
dinner
and
after
that
he
could
get
no
sleep
he
was
feverish
through
the
night
the
next
morning
he
felt
so
tired
so
discouraged
so
disgusted
with
his
weary
monotonous
life
between
the
deep
silent
forest
that
was
now
dark
with
verdure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tiresome
little
stream
that
flowed
beneath
his
windows
on
the
other
that
he
did
not
leave
his
bed
when
elisabeth
came
to
his
room
in
response
to
the
summons
of
his
bell
she
stood
in
the
doorway
pale
with
surprise
and
asked
him
is
monsieur
ill
yes
a
little
shall
i
send
for
the
doctor
no
i
am
subject
to
these
slight
indispositions
what
can
i
do
for
monsieur
he
ordered
his
bath
to
be
got
ready
a
breakfast
of
eggs
alone
and
tea
at
intervals
during
the
day
about
one
however
he
became
so
restless
that
he
determined
to
get
up
elisabeth
whom
he
had
rung
for
repeatedly
during
the
morning
with
the
fretful
irresolution
of
a
man
who
imagines
himself
ill
and
who
had
always
come
up
to
him
with
a
deep
desire
of
being
of
assistance
now
beholding
him
so
nervous
and
restless
with
a
blush
for
her
own
boldness
offered
to
read
to
him
he
asked
her
do
you
read
well
yes
monsieur
i
gained
all
the
prizes
for
reading
when
i
was
at
school
in
the
city
and
i
have
read
so
many
novels
to
mamma
that
i
ca
begin
to
remember
the
names
of
them
he
was
curious
to
see
how
she
would
do
and
he
sent
her
into
the
studio
to
look
among
the
books
that
he
had
packed
up
for
the
one
that
he
liked
best
of
all
manon
lescaut
when
she
returned
she
helped
him
to
settle
himself
in
bed
arranged
two
pillows
behind
his
back
took
a
chair
and
began
to
read
she
read
well
very
well
indeed
intelligently
and
with
a
pleasing
accent
that
seemed
a
special
gift
she
evinced
her
interest
in
the
story
from
the
commencement
and
showed
so
much
feeling
as
she
advanced
in
it
that
he
stopped
her
now
and
then
to
ask
her
a
question
and
have
a
little
conversation
about
the
plot
and
the
characters
through
the
open
windows
on
the
warm
breeze
loaded
with
the
sweet
odors
of
growing
things
came
the
trills
and
of
the
nightingales
among
the
trees
saluting
their
mates
with
their
amorous
ditties
in
this
season
of
awakening
love
the
young
girl
too
was
moved
beneath
andré
gaze
as
she
followed
with
bright
eyes
the
plot
unwinding
page
by
page
she
answered
the
questions
that
he
put
to
her
with
an
innate
appreciation
of
the
things
connected
with
tenderness
and
passion
an
appreciation
that
was
just
but
owing
to
the
ignorance
natural
to
her
position
sometimes
crude
he
thought
this
girl
would
be
very
intelligent
and
bright
if
she
had
a
little
teaching
her
womanly
charm
had
already
begun
to
make
itself
felt
in
him
and
really
did
him
good
that
warm
still
spring
afternoon
mingling
strangely
with
that
other
charm
so
powerful
and
so
mysterious
of
manon
the
strangest
conception
of
woman
ever
evoked
by
human
ingenuity
when
it
became
dark
after
this
day
of
inactivity
mariolle
sank
into
a
kind
of
dreaming
dozing
state
in
which
confused
visions
of
mme
de
burne
and
elisabeth
and
the
mistress
of
des
grieux
rose
before
his
eyes
as
he
had
not
left
his
room
since
the
day
before
and
had
taken
no
exercise
to
fatigue
him
he
slept
lightly
and
was
disturbed
by
an
unusual
noise
that
he
heard
about
the
house
once
or
twice
before
he
had
thought
that
he
heard
faint
sounds
and
footsteps
at
night
coming
from
the
ground
floor
not
directly
underneath
his
room
but
from
the
laundry
and
small
rooms
that
adjoined
the
kitchen
he
had
given
the
matter
no
attention
however
this
evening
tired
of
lying
in
bed
and
knowing
that
he
had
a
long
period
of
wakefulness
before
him
he
listened
and
distinguished
something
that
sounded
like
the
rustling
of
a
woman
garments
and
the
splashing
of
water
he
decided
that
he
would
go
and
investigate
lighted
a
candle
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
barely
ten
he
dressed
himself
and
having
slipped
a
revolver
into
his
pocket
made
his
way
down
the
stairs
on
tiptoe
with
the
stealthiness
of
a
cat
when
he
reached
the
kitchen
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
the
furnace
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
but
presently
he
was
conscious
of
something
stirring
in
the
a
small
whitewashed
apartment
that
opened
off
the
kitchen
and
contained
nothing
but
the
tub
he
went
noiselessly
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
with
a
quick
movement
there
extended
in
the
tub
he
beheld
the
most
beautiful
form
that
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
it
was
elisabeth
chapter
xiii
mariolle
copies
mme
de
burne
when
she
appeared
before
him
next
morning
bringing
him
his
tea
and
toast
and
their
eyes
met
she
began
to
tremble
so
that
the
cup
and
rattled
on
the
salver
mariolle
went
to
her
and
relieved
her
of
her
burden
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
as
she
still
kept
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
floor
he
said
to
her
look
at
me
little
one
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
they
were
full
of
tears
you
must
not
cry
he
continued
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
she
murmured
mon
dieu
he
knew
that
it
was
not
regret
nor
sorrow
nor
remorse
that
had
elicited
from
her
those
three
agitated
words
but
happiness
true
happiness
it
gave
him
a
strange
selfish
feeling
of
delight
physical
rather
than
moral
to
feel
this
small
person
resting
against
his
heart
to
feel
there
at
last
the
presence
of
a
woman
who
loved
him
he
thanked
her
for
it
as
a
wounded
man
lying
by
the
roadside
would
thank
a
woman
who
had
stopped
to
succor
him
he
thanked
her
with
all
his
lacerated
heart
and
he
pitied
her
a
little
too
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
as
he
watched
her
thus
pale
and
tearful
with
eyes
alight
with
love
he
suddenly
said
to
himself
why
she
is
beautiful
how
quickly
a
woman
changes
becomes
what
she
ought
to
be
under
the
influence
of
the
desires
of
her
feelings
and
the
necessities
of
her
existence
sit
down
he
said
to
her
he
took
her
hands
in
his
her
poor
toiling
hands
that
she
had
made
white
and
pretty
for
his
sake
and
very
gently
in
carefully
chosen
phrases
he
spoke
to
her
of
the
attitude
that
they
should
maintain
toward
each
other
she
was
no
longer
his
servant
but
she
would
preserve
the
appearance
of
being
so
for
a
while
yet
so
as
not
to
create
a
scandal
in
the
village
she
would
live
with
him
as
his
housekeeper
and
would
read
to
him
frequently
and
that
would
serve
to
account
for
the
change
in
the
situation
he
would
have
her
eat
at
his
table
after
a
little
as
soon
as
she
should
be
permanently
installed
in
her
position
as
his
reader
when
he
had
finished
she
simply
replied
no
monsieur
i
am
your
servant
and
i
will
continue
to
be
so
i
do
not
wish
to
have
people
learn
what
has
taken
place
and
talk
about
it
he
could
not
shake
her
determination
although
he
urged
her
strenuously
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
tea
she
carried
away
the
salver
while
he
followed
her
with
a
softened
look
when
she
was
gone
he
reflected
she
is
a
woman
he
thought
and
all
women
are
equal
when
they
are
pleasing
in
our
eyes
i
have
made
my
waitress
my
mistress
she
is
pretty
she
will
be
charming
at
all
events
she
is
younger
and
fresher
than
the
and
the
what
difference
does
it
make
after
all
how
many
celebrated
actresses
have
been
daughters
of
and
yet
they
are
received
as
ladies
they
are
adored
like
heroines
of
romance
and
princes
bow
before
them
as
if
they
were
queens
is
this
to
be
accounted
for
on
the
score
of
their
talent
which
is
often
doubtful
or
of
their
beauty
which
is
often
questionable
not
at
all
but
a
woman
in
truth
always
holds
the
place
that
she
is
able
to
create
for
herself
by
the
illusion
that
she
is
capable
of
inspiring
he
took
a
long
walk
that
day
and
although
he
still
felt
the
same
distress
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
his
legs
were
heavy
under
him
as
if
his
suffering
had
loosened
all
the
springs
of
his
energy
there
was
a
feeling
of
gladness
within
him
like
the
song
of
a
little
bird
he
was
not
so
lonely
he
felt
himself
less
utterly
abandoned
the
forest
appeared
to
him
less
silent
and
less
void
he
returned
to
his
house
with
the
glad
thought
that
elisabeth
would
come
out
to
meet
him
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
and
a
look
of
tenderness
in
her
eyes
the
life
that
he
now
led
for
about
a
month
on
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
was
a
real
idyl
mariolle
was
loved
as
perhaps
very
few
men
have
ever
been
as
a
child
is
loved
by
its
mother
as
the
hunter
is
loved
by
his
dog
he
was
all
in
all
to
her
her
heaven
and
earth
her
charm
and
delight
he
responded
to
all
her
ardent
and
artless
womanly
advances
giving
her
in
a
kiss
her
fill
of
ecstasy
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
soul
in
her
heart
and
in
her
flesh
there
was
no
object
but
him
her
intoxication
was
like
that
of
a
young
man
who
tastes
wine
for
the
first
time
surprised
and
delighted
he
reveled
in
the
bliss
of
this
absolute
and
he
felt
that
this
was
drinking
of
love
at
its
at
the
very
lips
of
nature
nevertheless
he
continued
to
be
sad
sad
and
haunted
by
his
deep
unyielding
disenchantment
his
little
mistress
was
agreeable
but
he
always
felt
the
absence
of
another
and
when
he
walked
in
the
meadows
or
on
the
banks
of
the
loing
and
asked
himself
why
does
this
lingering
care
stay
by
me
so
such
an
intolerable
feeling
of
desolation
rose
within
him
as
the
recollection
of
paris
crossed
his
mind
that
he
had
to
return
to
the
house
so
as
not
to
be
alone
then
he
would
swing
in
the
hammock
while
elisabeth
seated
on
a
would
read
to
him
as
he
watched
her
and
listened
to
her
he
would
recall
to
mind
conversations
in
the
of
michèle
in
the
days
when
he
passed
whole
evenings
alone
with
her
then
tears
would
start
to
his
eyes
and
such
bitter
regret
would
tear
his
heart
that
he
felt
that
he
must
start
at
once
for
paris
or
else
leave
the
country
forever
elisabeth
seeing
his
gloom
and
melancholy
asked
him
are
you
suffering
your
eyes
are
full
of
tears
give
me
a
kiss
little
one
he
replied
you
could
not
understand
she
kissed
him
anxiously
with
a
foreboding
of
some
tragedy
that
was
beyond
her
knowledge
he
forgetting
his
woes
for
a
moment
beneath
her
caresses
thought
oh
for
a
woman
who
could
be
these
two
in
one
who
might
have
the
affection
of
the
one
and
the
charm
of
the
other
why
is
it
that
we
never
encounter
the
object
of
our
dreams
that
we
always
meet
with
something
that
is
only
approximately
like
them
he
continued
his
vague
reflections
soothed
by
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
voice
that
fell
unheeded
on
his
ear
upon
all
the
charms
that
had
combined
to
seduce
and
vanquish
him
in
the
mistress
whom
he
had
abandoned
in
the
besetment
of
her
memory
of
her
imaginary
presence
by
which
he
was
haunted
as
a
visionary
by
a
phantom
he
asked
himself
am
i
condemned
to
carry
her
image
with
me
to
all
eternity
he
again
applied
himself
to
taking
long
walks
to
roaming
through
the
thicknesses
of
the
forest
with
the
vague
hope
that
he
might
lose
her
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
a
ravine
behind
a
rock
in
a
thicket
as
a
man
who
wishes
to
rid
himself
of
an
animal
that
he
does
not
care
to
kill
sometimes
takes
it
away
a
long
distance
so
that
it
may
not
find
its
way
home
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
walks
he
one
day
came
again
to
the
spot
where
the
beeches
grew
it
was
now
a
gloomy
forest
almost
as
black
as
night
with
impenetrable
foliage
he
passed
along
beneath
the
immense
deep
vault
in
the
damp
sultry
air
thinking
regretfully
of
his
earlier
visit
when
the
little
leaves
resembled
a
verdant
sunshiny
mist
and
as
he
was
following
a
narrow
path
he
suddenly
stopped
in
astonishment
before
two
trees
that
had
grown
together
it
was
a
sturdy
beech
embracing
with
two
of
its
branches
a
tall
slender
oak
and
there
could
have
been
no
picture
of
his
love
that
would
have
appealed
more
forcibly
and
more
touchingly
to
his
imagination
mariolle
seated
himself
to
contemplate
them
at
his
ease
to
his
diseased
mind
as
they
stood
there
in
their
motionless
strife
they
became
splendid
and
terrible
symbols
telling
to
him
and
to
all
who
might
pass
that
way
the
everlasting
story
of
his
love
then
he
went
on
his
way
again
sadder
than
before
and
as
he
walked
along
slowly
and
with
eyes
downcast
he
all
at
once
perceived
half
hidden
by
the
grass
and
stained
by
mud
and
rain
an
old
telegram
that
had
been
lost
or
thrown
there
by
some
wayfarer
he
stopped
what
was
the
message
of
joy
or
sorrow
that
the
bit
of
blue
paper
that
lay
there
at
his
feet
had
brought
to
some
expectant
soul
he
could
not
help
picking
it
up
and
opening
it
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
curiosity
and
disgust
the
words
come
me
four
were
still
legible
the
names
had
been
obliterated
by
the
moisture
memories
at
once
cruel
and
delightful
thronged
upon
his
mind
of
all
the
messages
that
he
had
received
from
her
now
to
appoint
the
hour
for
a
rendezvous
now
to
tell
him
that
she
could
not
come
to
him
never
had
anything
caused
him
such
emotion
nor
startled
him
so
violently
nor
so
stopped
his
poor
heart
and
then
set
it
thumping
again
as
had
the
sight
of
those
messages
burning
or
freezing
him
as
the
case
might
be
the
thought
that
he
should
never
receive
more
of
them
filled
him
with
unutterable
sorrow
again
he
asked
himself
what
her
thoughts
had
been
since
he
left
her
had
she
suffered
had
she
regretted
the
friend
whom
her
coldness
had
driven
from
her
or
had
she
merely
experienced
a
feeling
of
wounded
vanity
and
thought
nothing
more
of
his
abandonment
his
desire
to
learn
the
truth
was
so
strong
and
so
persistent
that
a
strange
and
audacious
yet
only
resolve
came
into
his
head
he
took
the
road
to
fontainebleau
and
when
he
reached
the
city
went
to
the
telegraph
office
his
mind
in
a
fluctuating
state
of
unrest
and
indecision
but
an
irresistible
force
proceeding
from
his
heart
seemed
to
urge
him
on
with
a
trembling
hand
then
he
took
from
the
desk
a
printed
blank
and
beneath
the
name
and
address
of
mme
de
burne
wrote
this
dispatch
i
would
so
much
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
me
for
my
part
i
can
forget
nothing
andré
mariolle
then
he
went
out
engaged
a
carriage
and
returned
to
montigny
disturbed
in
mind
by
what
he
had
done
and
regretting
it
already
he
had
calculated
that
in
case
she
condescended
to
answer
him
he
would
receive
a
letter
from
her
two
days
later
but
the
fear
and
the
hope
that
she
might
send
him
a
dispatch
kept
him
in
his
house
all
the
following
day
he
was
in
his
hammock
under
the
lindens
on
the
terrace
when
about
three
elisabeth
came
to
tell
him
that
there
was
a
lady
at
the
house
who
wanted
to
see
him
the
shock
was
so
great
that
his
breath
failed
him
for
a
moment
and
his
legs
bent
under
him
and
his
heart
beat
violently
as
he
went
toward
the
house
and
yet
he
could
not
dare
hope
that
it
was
she
when
he
appeared
at
the
door
mme
de
burne
arose
from
the
sofa
where
she
was
sitting
and
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
a
rather
reserved
smile
upon
her
face
with
a
slight
constraint
of
manner
and
attitude
saying
i
came
to
see
how
you
are
as
your
message
did
not
give
me
much
information
on
the
subject
he
had
become
so
pale
that
a
flash
of
delight
rose
to
her
eyes
and
his
emotion
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
speak
could
only
hold
his
lips
glued
to
the
hand
that
she
had
given
him
how
kind
of
you
he
said
at
last
no
but
i
do
not
forget
my
friends
and
i
was
anxious
about
you
she
looked
him
in
the
face
with
that
rapid
searching
woman
look
that
reads
everything
fathoms
one
thoughts
to
their
very
roots
and
unmasks
every
artifice
she
was
satisfied
apparently
for
her
face
brightened
with
a
smile
you
have
a
pretty
hermitage
here
she
continued
does
happiness
reside
in
it
no
madame
is
it
possible
in
this
fine
country
at
the
side
of
this
beautiful
forest
on
the
banks
of
this
pretty
stream
why
you
ought
to
be
at
rest
and
quite
contented
here
i
am
not
madame
why
not
then
because
i
can
not
forget
is
it
indispensable
to
your
happiness
that
you
should
forget
something
yes
madame
may
one
know
what
you
know
and
then
and
then
i
am
very
wretched
she
said
to
him
with
mingled
fatuity
and
commiseration
i
thought
that
was
the
case
when
i
received
your
telegram
and
that
was
the
reason
that
i
came
with
the
resolve
that
i
would
go
back
again
at
once
if
i
found
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
went
on
since
i
am
not
going
back
immediately
may
i
go
and
look
around
your
place
that
little
alley
of
lindens
yonder
has
a
very
charming
appearance
it
looks
as
if
it
might
be
cooler
out
there
than
here
in
this
they
went
out
she
had
on
a
mauve
dress
that
harmonized
so
well
with
the
verdure
of
the
trees
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
that
she
appeared
to
him
like
some
amazing
apparition
of
an
entirely
new
style
of
beauty
and
seductiveness
her
tall
and
willowy
form
her
bright
features
the
little
blaze
of
blond
hair
beneath
a
hat
that
was
mauve
like
the
dress
and
lightly
crowned
by
a
long
plume
of
rolled
about
it
her
tapering
arms
with
the
two
hands
holding
the
closed
sunshade
crosswise
before
her
the
loftiness
of
her
carriage
and
the
directness
of
her
step
seemed
to
introduce
into
the
humble
little
garden
something
exotic
something
that
was
foreign
to
it
it
was
a
figure
from
one
of
watteau
pictures
or
from
some
or
dream
the
imagination
of
a
poet
or
an
artist
fancy
which
had
been
seized
by
the
whim
of
coming
away
to
the
country
to
show
how
beautiful
it
was
as
mariolle
looked
at
her
all
trembling
with
his
newly
lighted
passion
he
recalled
to
mind
the
two
peasant
women
that
he
had
seen
in
montigny
village
who
is
the
little
person
who
opened
the
door
for
me
she
inquired
she
is
my
servant
she
does
not
look
like
a
waitress
no
she
is
very
good
looking
where
did
you
secure
her
quite
near
here
in
an
inn
frequented
by
painters
where
her
innocence
was
in
danger
from
the
customers
and
you
preserved
it
he
blushed
and
replied
yes
i
preserved
it
to
your
own
advantage
perhaps
certainly
to
my
own
advantage
for
i
would
rather
have
a
pretty
face
about
me
than
an
ugly
one
is
that
the
only
feeling
that
she
inspires
in
you
perhaps
it
was
she
who
inspired
in
me
the
irresistible
desire
of
seeing
you
again
for
every
woman
when
she
attracts
my
eyes
even
if
it
is
only
for
the
duration
of
a
second
carries
my
thoughts
back
to
you
that
was
a
very
pretty
piece
of
special
pleading
and
does
she
love
her
preserver
he
blushed
more
deeply
than
before
quick
as
lightning
the
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
that
jealousy
is
always
efficacious
as
a
stimulant
to
a
woman
feelings
and
decided
him
to
tell
only
half
a
lie
so
he
answered
hesitatingly
i
do
know
how
that
is
it
may
be
so
she
is
very
attentive
to
me
rather
pettishly
mme
de
burne
murmured
and
you
he
fastened
upon
her
his
eyes
that
were
aflame
with
love
and
replied
nothing
could
ever
distract
my
thoughts
from
you
this
was
also
a
very
shrewd
answer
but
the
phrase
seemed
to
her
so
much
the
expression
of
an
indisputable
truth
that
she
let
it
pass
without
noticing
it
could
a
woman
such
as
she
have
any
doubts
about
a
thing
like
that
so
she
was
satisfied
in
fact
and
had
no
further
doubts
upon
the
subject
of
elisabeth
they
took
two
canvas
chairs
and
seated
themselves
in
the
shade
of
the
lindens
over
the
running
stream
he
asked
her
what
did
you
think
of
me
that
you
must
have
been
very
wretched
was
it
through
my
fault
or
yours
through
the
fault
of
us
both
and
then
and
then
knowing
how
beside
yourself
you
were
i
reflected
that
it
would
be
best
to
give
you
a
little
time
to
cool
down
so
i
waited
what
were
you
waiting
for
for
a
word
from
you
i
received
it
and
here
i
am
now
we
are
going
to
talk
like
people
of
sense
so
you
love
me
still
i
do
not
ask
you
this
as
a
coquette
i
ask
it
as
your
friend
i
love
you
still
and
what
is
it
that
you
wish
how
can
i
answer
that
i
am
in
your
power
oh
my
ideas
are
very
clear
but
i
will
not
tell
you
them
without
first
knowing
what
yours
are
tell
me
of
yourself
of
what
has
been
passing
in
your
heart
and
in
your
mind
since
you
ran
away
from
me
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
i
have
had
no
other
occupation
he
told
her
of
his
resolution
to
forget
her
his
flight
his
coming
to
the
great
forest
in
which
he
had
found
nothing
but
her
image
of
his
days
filled
with
memories
of
her
and
his
long
nights
of
consuming
jealousy
he
told
her
everything
with
entire
truthfulness
always
excepting
his
love
for
elisabeth
whose
name
he
did
not
mention
she
listened
well
assured
that
he
was
not
lying
convinced
by
her
inner
consciousness
of
her
power
over
him
even
more
than
by
the
sincerity
of
his
manner
and
delighted
with
her
victory
glad
that
she
was
about
to
regain
him
for
she
loved
him
still
then
he
bemoaned
himself
over
this
situation
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
and
warming
up
as
he
told
of
all
that
he
had
suffered
after
having
carried
it
so
long
in
his
thoughts
he
again
reproached
her
but
without
anger
without
bitterness
in
terms
of
impassioned
poetry
with
that
impotency
of
loving
of
which
she
was
the
victim
he
told
her
over
and
over
others
have
not
the
gift
of
pleasing
you
have
not
the
gift
of
loving
she
interrupted
him
speaking
warmly
full
of
arguments
and
illustrations
at
least
i
have
the
gift
of
being
faithful
she
said
suppose
i
had
adored
you
for
ten
months
and
then
fallen
in
love
with
another
man
would
you
be
less
unhappy
than
you
are
he
exclaimed
is
it
then
impossible
for
a
woman
to
love
only
one
man
but
she
had
her
answer
ready
for
him
no
one
can
keep
on
loving
forever
all
that
one
can
do
is
to
be
constant
do
you
believe
that
that
exalted
delirium
of
the
senses
can
last
for
years
no
no
as
for
the
most
of
those
women
who
are
addicted
to
passions
to
violent
caprices
of
greater
or
less
duration
they
simply
transform
life
into
a
novel
their
heroes
are
different
the
events
and
circumstances
are
unforeseen
and
constantly
changing
the
varies
i
admit
that
for
them
it
is
amusing
and
diverting
for
with
every
change
they
have
a
new
set
of
emotions
but
for
when
it
is
ended
that
is
the
last
of
it
do
you
understand
me
yes
what
you
say
has
some
truth
in
it
but
i
do
not
see
what
you
are
getting
at
it
is
this
there
is
no
passion
that
endures
a
very
long
time
by
that
i
mean
a
burning
torturing
passion
like
that
from
which
you
are
suffering
now
it
is
a
crisis
that
i
have
made
hard
very
hard
for
you
to
bear
i
know
it
and
i
feel
it
by
by
the
aridity
of
my
tenderness
and
the
paralysis
of
my
emotional
nature
this
crisis
will
pass
away
however
for
it
can
not
last
forever
and
then
he
asked
with
anxiety
then
i
think
that
to
a
woman
who
is
as
reasonable
and
calm
as
i
am
you
can
make
yourself
a
lover
who
will
be
pleasing
in
every
way
for
you
have
a
great
deal
of
tact
on
the
other
hand
you
would
make
a
terrible
husband
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
husband
there
never
can
be
he
was
surprised
and
a
little
offended
why
he
asked
do
you
wish
to
keep
a
lover
that
you
do
not
love
she
answered
impetuously
i
do
love
him
my
friend
after
my
fashion
i
do
not
love
ardently
but
i
love
you
require
above
everything
else
to
be
loved
and
to
have
your
lovers
make
a
show
of
their
love
it
is
true
that
is
what
i
like
but
beyond
that
my
heart
requires
a
companion
apart
from
the
others
my
vainglorious
passion
for
public
homage
does
not
interfere
with
my
capacity
for
being
faithful
and
devoted
it
does
not
destroy
my
belief
that
i
have
something
of
myself
that
i
could
bestow
upon
a
lover
that
no
other
man
should
have
my
loyal
affection
the
sincere
attachment
of
my
heart
the
entire
and
secret
trustfulness
of
my
soul
in
exchange
for
which
i
should
receive
from
him
together
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
lover
the
sensation
so
sweet
and
so
rare
of
not
being
entirely
alone
upon
the
earth
that
is
not
love
from
the
way
you
look
at
it
but
it
is
not
entirely
valueless
either
he
bent
over
toward
her
trembling
with
emotion
and
stammered
will
you
let
me
be
that
man
yes
after
a
little
when
you
are
more
yourself
in
the
meantime
resign
yourself
to
a
little
suffering
once
in
a
while
for
my
sake
since
you
have
to
suffer
in
any
event
is
it
better
to
endure
it
at
my
side
rather
than
somewhere
far
from
me
her
smile
seemed
to
say
to
him
why
can
you
not
have
confidence
in
me
and
as
she
eyed
him
there
his
whole
frame
quivering
with
passion
she
experienced
through
every
fiber
of
her
being
a
feeling
of
satisfied
that
made
her
happy
in
her
way
in
the
way
that
the
bird
of
prey
is
happy
when
he
sees
his
quarry
lying
fascinated
beneath
him
and
awaiting
the
fatal
talons
when
do
you
return
to
paris
she
asked
why
be
it
you
will
come
and
dine
with
me
yes
madame
and
now
i
must
be
going
said
she
looking
at
the
watch
set
in
the
handle
of
her
parasol
oh
why
so
soon
because
i
must
catch
the
five
train
i
have
company
to
dinner
several
persons
the
princess
de
malten
bernhaus
lamarthe
massival
de
maltry
and
a
stranger
de
charlaine
the
explorer
who
is
just
back
from
upper
cambodia
after
a
wonderful
journey
he
is
all
the
talk
just
now
mariolle
spirits
fell
it
hurt
him
to
hear
these
names
mentioned
one
after
the
other
as
if
he
had
been
stung
by
so
many
wasps
they
were
poison
to
him
will
you
go
now
he
said
and
we
can
drive
through
the
forest
and
see
something
of
it
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
first
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
toast
when
the
tea
was
served
elisabeth
was
not
to
be
found
the
cook
said
that
she
had
gone
out
to
make
some
purchases
this
did
not
surprise
mme
de
burne
for
what
had
she
to
fear
now
from
this
servant
then
they
got
into
the
landau
that
was
standing
before
the
door
and
mariolle
made
the
coachman
take
them
to
the
station
by
a
roundabout
way
which
took
them
past
the
as
they
rolled
along
beneath
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
where
the
nightingales
were
singing
she
was
seized
by
the
ineffable
sensation
that
the
mysterious
and
charm
of
nature
impresses
on
the
heart
of
man
she
said
how
beautiful
it
is
how
calm
and
restful
he
accompanied
her
to
the
station
and
as
they
were
about
to
part
she
said
to
him
i
shall
see
you
at
eight
then
at
eight
madame
she
radiant
with
happiness
went
her
way
and
he
returned
to
his
house
in
the
landau
happy
and
contented
but
uneasy
withal
for
he
knew
that
this
was
not
the
end
why
should
he
resist
he
felt
that
he
could
not
she
held
him
by
a
charm
that
he
could
not
understand
that
was
stronger
than
all
flight
would
not
deliver
him
would
not
sever
him
from
her
but
would
be
an
intolerable
privation
while
if
he
could
only
succeed
in
showing
a
little
resignation
he
would
obtain
from
her
at
least
as
much
as
she
had
promised
for
she
was
a
woman
who
always
kept
her
word
the
horses
trotted
along
under
the
trees
and
he
reflected
that
not
once
during
that
interview
had
she
put
up
her
lips
to
him
for
a
kiss
she
was
ever
the
same
nothing
in
her
would
ever
change
and
he
would
always
perhaps
have
to
suffer
at
her
hands
in
just
that
same
way
the
remembrance
of
the
bitter
hours
that
he
had
already
passed
with
the
intolerable
certainty
that
he
would
never
succeed
in
rousing
her
to
passion
laid
heavy
on
his
heart
and
gave
him
a
clear
foresight
of
struggles
to
come
and
of
similar
distress
in
the
future
still
he
was
content
to
suffer
everything
rather
than
lose
her
again
resigned
even
to
that
everlasting
ever
unappeased
desire
that
rioted
in
his
veins
and
burned
into
his
flesh
the
raging
thoughts
that
had
so
often
possessed
him
on
his
way
back
alone
from
auteuil
were
now
setting
in
again
they
began
to
agitate
his
frame
as
the
landau
rolled
smoothly
along
in
the
cool
shadows
of
the
great
trees
when
all
at
once
the
thought
of
elisabeth
awaiting
him
there
at
his
door
she
too
young
and
fresh
and
pretty
her
heart
full
of
love
and
her
mouth
full
of
kisses
brought
peace
to
his
soul
presently
he
would
be
holding
her
in
his
arms
and
closing
his
eyes
and
deceiving
himself
as
men
deceive
others
confounding
in
the
intoxication
of
the
embrace
her
whom
he
loved
and
her
by
whom
he
was
loved
he
would
possess
them
both
at
once
even
now
it
was
certain
that
he
had
a
liking
for
her
that
grateful
attachment
of
soul
and
body
that
always
pervades
the
human
animal
as
the
result
of
love
inspired
and
pleasure
shared
in
common
this
child
whom
he
had
made
his
own
would
she
not
be
to
his
dry
and
wasting
love
the
little
spring
that
bubbles
up
at
the
evening
halting
place
the
promise
of
the
cool
draught
that
sustains
our
energy
as
wearily
we
traverse
the
burning
desert
when
he
regained
the
house
however
the
girl
had
not
come
in
he
was
frightened
and
uneasy
and
said
to
the
other
servant
you
are
sure
that
she
went
out
yes
monsieur
thereupon
he
also
went
out
in
the
hope
of
finding
her
when
he
had
taken
a
few
steps
and
was
about
to
turn
into
the
long
street
that
runs
up
the
valley
he
beheld
before
him
the
old
low
church
surmounted
by
its
square
tower
seated
upon
a
little
knoll
and
watching
the
houses
of
its
small
village
as
a
hen
watches
over
her
chicks
a
presentiment
that
she
was
there
impelled
him
to
enter
who
can
tell
the
strange
glimpses
of
the
truth
that
a
woman
heart
is
capable
of
perceiving
what
had
she
thought
how
much
had
she
understood
where
could
she
have
fled
for
refuge
but
there
if
the
shadow
of
the
truth
had
passed
before
her
eyes
the
church
was
very
dark
for
night
was
closing
in
the
dim
lamp
hanging
from
its
chain
suggested
in
the
tabernacle
the
ideal
presence
of
the
divine
consoler
with
hushed
footsteps
mariolle
passed
up
along
the
lines
of
benches
when
he
reached
the
choir
he
saw
a
woman
on
her
knees
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
he
approached
recognized
her
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
they
were
alone
she
gave
a
great
start
as
she
turned
her
head
she
was
weeping
what
is
the
matter
he
said
she
murmured
i
see
it
all
you
came
here
because
she
had
caused
you
to
suffer
she
came
to
take
you
away
he
spoke
in
broken
accents
touched
by
the
grief
that
he
in
turn
had
caused
you
are
mistaken
little
one
i
am
going
back
to
paris
indeed
but
i
shall
take
you
with
me
she
repeated
incredulously
it
ca
be
true
it
ca
be
true
i
swear
to
you
that
it
is
true
when
she
began
again
to
sob
and
groan
my
god
my
god
then
he
raised
her
to
her
feet
and
led
her
down
the
hill
through
the
thick
blackness
of
the
night
but
when
they
came
to
the
he
made
her
sit
down
upon
the
grass
and
placed
himself
beside
her
he
heard
the
beating
of
her
heart
and
her
quick
breathing
and
clasping
her
to
his
heart
troubled
by
his
remorse
he
whispered
to
her
gentle
words
that
he
had
never
used
before
softened
by
pity
and
burning
with
desire
every
word
that
he
uttered
was
true
he
did
not
endeavor
to
deceive
her
and
surprised
himself
at
what
he
said
and
what
he
felt
he
wondered
how
it
was
that
thrilling
yet
with
the
presence
of
that
other
one
whose
slave
he
was
always
to
be
he
could
tremble
thus
with
longing
and
emotion
while
consoling
this
heart
he
promised
that
he
would
love
her
he
did
not
say
simply
love
that
he
would
give
her
a
nice
little
house
near
his
own
and
pretty
furniture
to
put
in
it
and
a
servant
to
wait
on
her
she
was
reassured
as
she
listened
to
him
and
gradually
grew
calmer
for
she
could
not
believe
that
he
was
capable
of
deceiving
her
and
besides
his
tone
and
manner
told
her
that
he
was
sincere
convinced
at
length
and
dazzled
by
the
vision
of
being
a
lady
by
the
prospect
so
undreamed
of
by
the
poor
girl
the
servant
of
the
inn
of
becoming
the
good
friend
of
such
a
rich
nice
gentleman
she
was
carried
away
in
a
whirl
of
pride
covetousness
and
gratitude
that
mingled
with
her
fondness
for
andré
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
covering
his
face
with
kisses
she
stammered
oh
i
love
you
so
you
are
all
in
all
to
me
he
was
touched
and
returned
her
caresses
darling
my
little
darling
he
murmured
already
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
who
but
now
had
caused
her
so
much
sorrow
there
must
have
been
some
vague
feeling
of
doubt
floating
in
her
mind
however
for
presently
she
asked
him
in
a
tremulous
voice
really
and
truly
you
will
love
me
as
you
love
me
now
and
unhesitatingly
he
replied
i
will
love
you
as
i
love
you
now
the
olive
grove
and
other
tales
the
olive
grove
when
the
of
garandou
a
little
port
of
provence
situated
in
the
bay
of
pisca
between
marseilles
and
toulon
perceived
the
boat
of
the
abbé
vilbois
entering
the
harbor
they
went
down
to
the
beach
to
help
him
pull
her
ashore
the
priest
was
alone
in
the
boat
in
spite
of
his
years
he
rowed
with
all
the
energy
of
a
real
sailor
he
had
placed
his
hat
on
the
bench
beside
him
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
disclosing
his
powerful
arms
his
cassock
was
open
at
the
neck
and
turned
over
his
knees
and
he
wore
a
round
hat
of
heavy
white
canvas
his
whole
appearance
bespoke
an
odd
and
strenuous
priest
of
southern
climes
better
fitted
for
adventures
than
for
clerical
duties
he
rowed
with
strong
and
measured
strokes
as
if
to
show
the
southern
sailors
how
the
men
of
the
north
handle
the
oars
and
from
time
to
time
he
turned
around
to
look
at
the
landing
point
the
skiff
struck
the
beach
and
slid
far
up
the
bow
plowing
through
the
sand
then
it
stopped
abruptly
the
five
men
watching
for
the
abbé
drew
near
jovial
and
smiling
well
said
one
with
the
strong
accent
of
provence
have
you
been
successful
monsieur
le
curé
the
abbé
drew
in
the
oars
removed
his
canvas
put
on
his
hat
pulled
down
his
sleeves
and
buttoned
his
coat
then
having
assumed
the
usual
appearance
of
a
village
priest
he
replied
proudly
yes
i
have
caught
three
two
eels
and
five
sunfish
the
fishermen
gathered
around
the
boat
to
examine
with
the
air
of
experts
the
dead
fish
the
fat
the
eels
those
hideous
and
the
violet
sunfish
streaked
with
bright
stripes
said
one
i
carry
them
up
to
your
house
monsieur
le
curé
thank
you
my
friend
having
shaken
hands
all
around
the
priest
started
homeward
followed
by
the
man
with
the
fish
the
others
took
charge
of
the
boat
the
abbé
vilbois
walked
along
slowly
with
an
air
of
dignity
the
exertion
of
rowing
had
brought
beads
of
perspiration
to
his
brow
and
he
uncovered
his
head
each
time
that
he
passed
through
the
shade
of
an
olive
grove
the
warm
evening
air
freshened
by
a
slight
breeze
from
the
sea
cooled
his
high
forehead
covered
with
short
white
hair
a
forehead
far
more
suggestive
of
an
officer
than
of
a
priest
the
village
appeared
built
on
a
hill
rising
from
a
large
valley
which
descended
toward
the
sea
it
was
a
summer
evening
the
dazzling
sun
traveling
toward
the
ragged
crests
of
the
distant
hills
outlined
on
the
white
dusty
road
the
figure
of
the
priest
the
shadow
of
whose
hat
bobbed
merrily
over
the
fields
sometimes
apparently
climbing
the
trunks
of
the
only
to
fall
immediately
to
the
ground
and
creep
among
them
with
every
step
he
took
he
raised
a
cloud
of
fine
white
dust
the
invisible
powder
which
in
summer
covers
the
roads
of
provence
it
clung
to
the
edge
of
his
cassock
turning
it
grayish
white
completely
refreshed
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
he
strode
along
slowly
and
ponderously
like
a
mountaineer
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
distant
village
where
he
had
lived
twenty
years
and
where
he
hoped
to
die
its
church
his
church
rose
above
the
houses
clustered
around
it
the
square
turrets
of
gray
stone
of
unequal
proportions
and
quaint
design
stood
outlined
against
the
beautiful
southern
valley
and
their
architecture
suggested
the
fortifications
of
some
old
château
rather
than
the
steeples
of
a
place
of
worship
the
abbé
was
happy
for
he
had
caught
three
two
eels
and
five
sunfish
it
would
enable
him
to
triumph
again
over
his
flock
which
respected
him
no
doubt
because
he
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
of
the
place
despite
his
years
these
little
innocent
vanities
were
his
greatest
pleasures
he
was
a
fine
marksman
sometimes
he
practiced
with
his
neighbor
a
retired
army
provost
who
kept
a
tobacco
shop
he
could
also
swim
better
than
anyone
along
the
coast
in
his
day
he
had
been
a
society
man
the
baron
de
vilbois
but
had
entered
the
priesthood
after
an
unfortunate
being
the
scion
of
an
old
family
of
picardy
devout
and
royalistic
whose
sons
for
centuries
had
entered
the
army
the
magistracy
or
the
church
his
first
thought
was
to
follow
his
mother
advice
and
become
a
priest
but
he
yielded
to
his
father
suggestion
that
he
should
study
law
in
paris
and
seek
some
high
office
while
he
was
completing
his
studies
his
father
was
carried
off
by
pneumonia
his
mother
who
was
greatly
affected
by
the
loss
died
soon
afterward
he
came
into
a
fortune
and
consequently
gave
up
the
idea
of
following
a
profession
to
live
a
life
of
idleness
he
was
handsome
and
intelligent
but
somewhat
prejudiced
by
the
traditions
and
principles
which
he
had
inherited
along
with
his
muscular
frame
from
a
long
line
of
ancestors
society
gladly
welcomed
him
and
he
enjoyed
himself
after
the
fashion
of
a
and
seriously
inclined
young
man
but
it
happened
that
a
friend
introduced
him
to
a
young
actress
a
pupil
of
the
conservatoire
who
was
appearing
with
great
success
at
the
odéon
it
was
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
his
sentiment
had
all
the
violence
the
passion
of
a
man
born
to
believe
in
absolute
ideas
he
saw
her
act
the
romantic
rôle
in
which
she
had
achieved
a
triumph
the
first
night
of
her
appearance
she
was
pretty
and
though
naturally
perverse
possessed
the
face
of
an
angel
she
conquered
him
completely
she
transformed
him
into
a
delirious
fool
into
one
of
those
ecstatic
idiots
whom
a
woman
look
will
forever
chain
to
the
pyre
of
fatal
passions
she
became
his
mistress
and
left
the
stage
they
lived
together
four
years
his
love
for
her
increasing
during
the
time
he
would
have
married
her
in
spite
of
his
proud
name
and
family
traditions
had
he
not
discovered
that
for
a
long
time
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
him
with
the
friend
who
had
introduced
them
the
awakening
was
terrible
for
she
was
about
to
become
a
mother
and
he
was
awaiting
the
birth
of
the
child
to
make
her
his
wife
when
he
held
the
proof
of
her
transgressions
some
letters
found
in
a
drawer
he
confronted
her
with
his
knowledge
and
reproached
her
with
all
the
savageness
of
his
uncouth
nature
for
her
unfaithfulness
and
deceit
but
she
a
child
of
the
people
being
as
sure
of
this
man
as
of
the
other
braved
and
insulted
him
with
the
inherited
daring
of
those
women
who
in
times
of
war
mounted
with
the
men
on
the
barricades
he
would
have
struck
her
to
the
ground
but
she
showed
him
her
form
as
white
as
death
he
checked
himself
remembering
that
a
child
of
his
would
soon
be
born
to
this
vile
polluted
creature
he
rushed
at
her
to
crush
them
both
to
obliterate
this
double
shame
reeling
under
his
blows
and
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
stamp
out
the
life
of
her
unborn
babe
she
realized
that
she
was
lost
throwing
out
her
hands
to
parry
the
blows
she
cried
do
not
kill
me
it
is
his
not
yours
he
fell
back
so
stunned
with
surprise
that
for
a
moment
his
rage
subsided
he
stammered
what
what
did
you
say
crazed
with
fright
having
read
her
doom
in
his
eyes
and
gestures
she
repeated
it
not
yours
it
his
through
his
clenched
teeth
he
stammered
the
child
yes
you
lie
and
again
he
lifted
his
foot
as
if
to
crush
her
while
she
struggled
to
her
knees
in
a
vain
attempt
to
rise
i
tell
you
it
his
if
it
was
yours
would
it
have
come
much
sooner
he
was
struck
by
the
truth
of
this
argument
in
a
moment
of
strange
lucidity
his
mind
evolved
precise
conclusive
irresistible
reasons
to
disclaim
the
child
of
this
miserable
woman
and
he
felt
so
appeased
so
happy
at
the
thought
that
he
decided
to
let
her
live
he
then
spoke
in
a
calmer
voice
get
up
and
leave
and
never
let
me
see
you
again
quite
cowed
she
obeyed
him
and
went
he
never
saw
her
again
then
he
left
paris
and
came
south
he
stopped
in
a
village
situated
in
a
valley
near
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
selecting
for
his
abode
an
inn
facing
the
sea
he
lived
there
eighteen
months
in
complete
seclusion
nursing
his
sorrow
and
despair
the
memory
of
the
unfaithful
one
tortured
him
her
grace
her
charm
her
perversity
haunted
him
and
withal
came
the
regret
of
her
caresses
he
wandered
aimlessly
in
those
beautiful
vales
of
provence
baring
his
head
filled
with
the
thoughts
of
that
woman
to
the
sun
that
filtered
through
the
leaves
of
the
his
former
ideas
of
religion
the
abated
ardor
of
his
faith
returned
to
him
during
his
sorrowful
retreat
religion
had
formerly
seemed
a
refuge
from
the
unknown
temptations
of
life
now
it
appeared
as
a
refuge
from
its
snares
and
tortures
he
had
never
given
up
the
habit
of
prayer
in
his
sorrow
he
turned
anew
to
its
consolations
and
often
at
dusk
he
would
wander
into
the
little
village
church
where
in
the
darkness
gleamed
the
light
of
the
lamp
hung
above
the
altar
to
guard
the
sanctuary
and
symbolize
the
divine
presence
he
confided
his
sorrow
to
his
god
told
him
of
his
misery
asking
advice
pity
help
and
consolation
each
day
his
fervid
prayers
disclosed
stronger
faith
the
bleeding
heart
of
this
man
crushed
by
love
for
a
woman
still
longed
for
affection
and
soon
his
prayers
his
seclusion
his
constant
communion
with
the
savior
who
consoles
and
cheers
the
weary
wrought
a
change
in
him
and
the
mystic
love
of
god
entered
his
soul
casting
out
the
love
of
the
flesh
he
then
decided
to
take
up
his
former
plans
and
to
devote
his
life
to
the
church
he
became
a
priest
through
family
connections
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
call
to
the
parish
of
this
village
which
he
had
come
across
by
chance
devoting
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
to
the
maintenance
of
charitable
institutions
and
keeping
only
enough
to
enable
him
to
help
the
poor
as
long
as
he
lived
he
sought
refuge
in
a
quiet
life
filled
with
prayer
and
acts
of
kindness
toward
his
but
a
priest
with
a
soldier
temperament
he
guided
his
blind
erring
flock
forcibly
through
the
mazes
of
this
life
in
which
every
taste
instinct
and
desire
is
a
pitfall
but
the
old
man
in
him
never
disappeared
entirely
he
continued
to
love
exercise
and
noble
sports
but
he
hated
every
woman
having
an
almost
childish
fear
of
their
dangerous
fascination
ii
the
sailor
who
followed
the
priest
being
a
southerner
found
it
difficult
to
refrain
from
talking
but
he
did
not
dare
start
a
conversation
for
the
abbé
exerted
a
great
prestige
over
his
flock
at
last
he
ventured
a
remark
so
you
like
your
lodge
do
you
monsieur
le
curé
this
lodge
was
one
of
the
tiny
constructions
that
are
inhabited
during
the
summer
by
the
villagers
and
the
town
people
alike
it
was
situated
in
a
field
not
far
from
the
and
the
abbé
had
hired
it
because
the
latter
was
very
small
and
built
in
the
heart
of
the
village
next
to
the
church
during
the
summer
time
he
did
not
live
altogether
at
the
lodge
but
would
remain
a
few
days
at
a
time
to
practice
and
be
close
to
nature
yes
my
friend
said
the
priest
i
like
it
very
well
the
low
structure
could
now
be
seen
it
was
painted
pink
and
the
walls
were
almost
hidden
under
the
leaves
and
branches
of
the
that
grew
in
the
open
field
a
tall
woman
was
passing
in
and
out
of
the
door
setting
a
small
table
at
which
she
placed
at
each
trip
a
knife
and
fork
a
glass
a
plate
a
napkin
and
a
piece
of
bread
she
wore
the
small
cap
of
the
women
of
arles
a
pointed
cone
of
silk
or
black
velvet
decorated
with
a
white
rosette
when
the
abbé
was
near
enough
to
make
himself
heard
he
shouted
eh
marguerite
she
stopped
to
ascertain
whence
the
voice
came
and
recognizing
her
master
oh
it
you
monsieur
le
curé
yes
i
have
caught
some
fine
fish
and
want
you
to
broil
this
sunfish
immediately
do
you
hear
the
servant
examined
with
a
critical
and
approving
glance
the
fish
that
the
sailor
carried
yes
but
we
are
going
to
have
a
chicken
for
dinner
she
said
well
it
can
not
be
helped
the
fish
will
not
be
as
fresh
as
it
is
now
i
mean
to
enjoy
a
little
feast
it
does
not
happen
often
and
the
sin
is
not
great
the
woman
picked
out
a
sunfish
and
prepared
to
go
into
the
house
ah
she
said
a
man
came
to
see
you
three
times
while
you
were
out
monsieur
le
curé
indifferently
he
inquired
a
man
what
kind
of
man
why
a
man
whose
appearance
was
not
in
his
favor
what
a
beggar
perhaps
i
do
know
but
i
think
he
is
more
of
a
the
abbé
smiled
at
this
word
which
in
the
language
of
provence
means
a
highwayman
a
tramp
for
he
was
well
aware
of
marguerite
timidity
and
knew
that
every
day
and
especially
every
night
she
fancied
they
would
be
murdered
he
handed
a
few
sous
to
the
sailor
who
departed
and
just
as
he
was
saying
i
am
going
to
wash
my
hands
for
his
past
dainty
habits
still
clung
to
him
marguerite
called
to
him
from
the
kitchen
where
she
was
scraping
the
fish
with
a
knife
thereby
detaching
its
silvery
scales
there
he
comes
the
abbé
looked
down
the
road
and
saw
a
man
coming
slowly
toward
the
house
he
seemed
poorly
dressed
indeed
so
far
as
he
could
distinguish
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
servant
anxiety
and
thought
while
he
waited
for
the
stranger
i
think
after
all
she
is
right
he
does
look
like
a
the
man
walked
slowly
with
his
eyes
on
the
priest
and
his
hands
buried
deep
in
his
pockets
he
was
young
and
wore
a
full
blond
beard
strands
of
curly
hair
escaped
from
his
soft
felt
hat
which
was
so
dirty
and
battered
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
its
former
color
and
appearance
he
was
clothed
in
a
long
dark
overcoat
from
which
emerged
the
frayed
edge
of
his
trousers
on
his
feet
were
bathing
shoes
that
deadened
his
steps
giving
him
the
stealthy
walk
of
a
sneak
thief
when
he
had
come
within
a
few
steps
of
the
priest
he
doffed
with
a
sweeping
motion
the
ragged
hat
that
shaded
his
brow
he
was
not
bad
looking
though
his
face
showed
signs
of
dissipation
and
the
top
of
his
head
was
bald
an
indication
of
premature
fatigue
and
debauch
for
he
certainly
was
not
over
years
old
the
priest
responded
at
once
to
his
bow
feeling
that
this
fellow
was
not
an
ordinary
tramp
a
mechanic
out
of
work
or
a
hardly
able
to
speak
any
other
tongue
but
the
mysterious
language
of
prisons
how
do
you
do
monsieur
le
curé
said
the
man
the
priest
answered
simply
i
salute
you
unwilling
to
address
this
ragged
stranger
as
monsieur
they
considered
each
other
attentively
the
abbé
felt
uncomfortable
under
the
gaze
of
the
tramp
invaded
by
a
feeling
of
unrest
unknown
to
him
at
last
the
vagabond
continued
well
do
you
recognize
me
greatly
surprised
the
priest
answered
why
no
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
ah
you
do
not
know
me
look
at
me
well
i
have
never
seen
you
before
well
that
may
be
true
replied
the
man
sarcastically
but
let
me
show
you
some
one
whom
you
will
know
better
he
put
on
his
hat
and
unbuttoned
his
coat
revealing
his
bare
chest
a
red
sash
wound
around
his
spare
frame
held
his
trousers
in
place
he
drew
an
envelope
from
his
coat
pocket
one
of
those
soiled
wrappers
destined
to
protect
the
sundry
papers
of
the
tramp
whether
they
be
stolen
or
legitimate
property
those
papers
which
he
guards
jealously
and
uses
to
protect
himself
against
the
too
zealous
gendarmes
he
pulled
out
a
photograph
about
the
size
of
a
folded
letter
one
of
those
pictures
which
were
popular
long
ago
it
was
yellow
and
dim
with
age
for
he
had
carried
it
around
with
him
everywhere
and
the
heat
of
his
body
had
faded
it
pushing
it
under
the
abbé
eyes
he
demanded
do
you
know
him
the
priest
took
a
step
forward
to
look
and
grew
pale
for
it
was
his
own
likeness
that
he
had
given
her
years
ago
failing
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
situation
he
remained
silent
the
tramp
repeated
do
you
recognize
him
and
the
priest
stammered
yes
who
is
it
it
is
i
it
is
you
yes
well
then
look
at
us
both
at
me
and
at
your
picture
already
the
unhappy
man
had
seen
that
these
two
beings
the
one
in
the
picture
and
the
one
by
his
side
resembled
each
other
like
brothers
yet
he
did
not
understand
and
muttered
well
what
is
it
you
wish
then
in
an
ugly
voice
the
tramp
replied
what
do
i
wish
why
first
i
wish
you
to
recognize
me
who
are
you
who
am
i
ask
anybody
by
the
roadside
ask
your
servant
let
go
and
ask
the
mayor
and
show
him
this
and
he
will
laugh
i
tell
you
that
ah
you
will
not
recognize
me
as
your
son
papa
curé
the
old
man
raised
his
arms
above
his
head
with
a
patriarchal
gesture
and
muttered
despairingly
it
can
not
be
true
the
young
fellow
drew
quite
close
to
him
ah
it
can
not
be
true
you
say
you
must
stop
lying
do
you
hear
his
clenched
fists
and
threatening
face
and
the
violence
with
which
he
spoke
made
the
priest
retreat
a
few
steps
while
he
asked
himself
anxiously
which
one
of
them
was
laboring
under
a
mistake
again
he
asserted
i
never
had
a
child
the
other
man
replied
and
no
mistress
either
the
aged
priest
resolutely
uttered
one
word
a
proud
admission
yes
and
was
not
this
mistress
about
to
give
birth
to
a
child
when
you
left
her
suddenly
the
anger
which
had
been
quelled
years
ago
not
quelled
but
buried
in
the
heart
of
the
lover
burst
through
the
wall
of
faith
resignation
and
renunciation
he
had
built
around
it
almost
beside
himself
he
shouted
i
left
her
because
she
was
unfaithful
to
me
and
was
carrying
the
child
of
another
man
had
it
not
been
for
this
i
should
have
killed
both
you
and
her
sir
the
young
man
hesitated
taken
aback
at
the
sincerity
of
this
outburst
then
he
replied
in
a
gentler
voice
who
told
you
that
it
was
another
man
child
she
told
me
herself
and
braved
me
without
contesting
this
assertion
the
vagabond
assumed
the
indifferent
tone
of
a
loafer
judging
a
case
well
then
mother
made
a
mistake
that
all
after
his
outburst
of
rage
the
priest
had
succeeded
in
mastering
himself
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
inquire
and
who
told
you
that
you
were
my
son
my
mother
on
her
deathbed
le
curé
and
then
this
and
he
held
the
picture
under
the
eyes
of
the
priest
the
old
man
took
it
from
him
and
slowly
with
a
heart
bursting
with
anguish
he
compared
this
stranger
with
his
faded
likeness
and
doubted
no
longer
it
was
his
son
an
awful
distress
wrung
his
very
soul
a
terrible
inexpressible
emotion
invaded
him
it
was
like
the
remorse
of
some
ancient
crime
he
began
to
understand
a
little
he
guessed
the
rest
he
lived
over
the
brutal
scene
of
the
parting
it
was
to
save
her
life
then
that
the
wretched
and
deceitful
woman
had
lied
to
him
her
outraged
lover
and
he
had
believed
her
and
a
son
of
his
had
been
brought
into
the
world
and
had
grown
up
to
be
this
sordid
tramp
who
exhaled
the
very
odor
of
vice
as
a
goat
exhales
its
animal
smell
he
whispered
will
you
take
a
little
walk
with
me
so
that
we
can
discuss
these
matters
the
young
man
sneered
why
certainly
is
that
what
i
came
for
they
walked
side
by
side
through
the
olive
grove
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
coolness
of
southern
twilights
spread
an
invisible
cloak
over
the
country
the
priest
shivered
and
raising
his
eyes
with
a
familiar
motion
perceived
the
trembling
gray
foliage
of
the
holy
tree
which
had
spread
its
frail
shadow
over
the
son
of
man
in
his
great
trouble
and
despondency
a
short
despairing
prayer
rose
within
him
uttered
by
his
voice
a
prayer
by
which
christians
implore
the
savior
aid
o
lord
have
mercy
on
me
turning
to
his
son
he
said
so
your
mother
is
dead
these
words
your
mother
is
dead
awakened
a
new
sorrow
it
was
the
torment
of
the
flesh
which
can
not
forget
the
cruel
echo
of
past
sufferings
but
mostly
the
thrill
of
the
fleeting
delirious
bliss
of
his
youthful
passion
the
young
man
replied
yes
monsieur
le
curé
my
mother
is
dead
has
she
been
dead
a
long
while
yes
three
years
a
new
doubt
entered
the
priest
mind
and
why
did
you
not
find
me
out
before
the
other
man
hesitated
i
was
unable
to
i
was
prevented
but
excuse
me
for
interrupting
these
recollections
i
will
enter
into
more
details
later
for
i
have
not
had
anything
to
eat
since
yesterday
morning
a
tremor
of
pity
shook
the
old
man
and
holding
forth
both
hands
oh
my
poor
child
he
said
the
young
fellow
took
those
big
powerful
hands
in
his
own
slender
and
feverish
palms
then
he
replied
with
that
air
of
sarcasm
which
hardly
ever
left
his
lips
ah
i
beginning
to
think
that
we
shall
get
along
very
well
together
after
all
the
curé
started
toward
the
lodge
let
us
go
to
dinner
he
said
he
suddenly
remembered
with
a
vague
and
instinctive
pleasure
the
fine
fish
he
had
caught
which
with
the
chicken
would
make
a
good
meal
for
the
poor
fellow
the
servant
was
in
front
of
the
door
watching
their
approach
with
an
anxious
and
forbidding
face
marguerite
shouted
the
abbé
take
the
table
and
put
it
into
the
right
away
and
set
two
places
as
quick
as
you
can
the
woman
seemed
stunned
at
the
idea
that
her
master
was
going
to
dine
with
this
tramp
but
the
abbé
without
waiting
for
her
removed
the
plate
and
napkin
and
carried
the
little
table
into
the
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
sitting
opposite
the
beggar
in
front
of
a
filled
with
savory
cabbage
soup
which
sent
up
a
cloud
of
fragrant
steam
iii
when
the
plates
were
filled
the
tramp
fell
to
with
ravenous
avidity
the
abbé
had
lost
his
appetite
and
ate
slowly
leaving
the
bread
in
the
bottom
of
his
plate
suddenly
he
inquired
what
is
your
name
the
man
smiled
he
was
delighted
to
satisfy
his
hunger
father
unknown
he
said
and
no
other
name
but
my
mother
which
you
probably
remember
but
i
possess
two
christian
names
which
by
the
way
are
quite
unsuited
to
me
the
priest
whitened
why
were
you
named
thus
he
asked
the
tramp
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
fancy
you
ought
to
know
after
mother
left
you
she
wished
to
make
your
rival
believe
that
i
was
his
child
he
did
believe
it
until
i
was
about
fifteen
then
i
began
to
look
too
much
like
you
and
he
disclaimed
me
the
scoundrel
i
had
been
christened
now
if
i
had
not
resembled
a
soul
or
if
i
had
been
the
son
of
a
third
person
who
had
stayed
in
the
background
i
should
be
the
vicomte
de
pravallon
son
of
the
count
and
senator
bearing
this
name
i
have
christened
myself
how
did
you
learn
all
this
they
discussed
it
before
me
you
know
pretty
lively
discussions
they
were
too
i
tell
you
that
what
shows
you
the
seamy
side
of
life
something
more
distressing
than
all
he
had
suffered
during
the
last
half
hour
now
oppressed
the
priest
it
was
a
sort
of
suffocation
which
seemed
as
if
it
would
grow
and
grow
till
it
killed
him
it
was
not
due
so
much
to
the
things
he
heard
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
uttered
by
this
wayside
tramp
between
himself
and
this
beggar
between
his
son
and
himself
he
was
discovering
the
existence
of
those
moral
divergencies
which
are
as
fatal
poisons
to
certain
souls
was
this
his
son
he
could
not
yet
believe
it
he
wanted
all
the
proofs
every
one
of
them
he
wanted
to
hear
all
to
listen
to
all
again
he
thought
of
the
that
shaded
his
little
lodge
and
for
the
second
time
he
prayed
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
had
finished
his
soup
he
inquired
is
there
nothing
else
abbé
the
kitchen
was
built
in
an
annex
marguerite
could
not
hear
her
master
voice
he
always
called
her
by
striking
a
chinese
gong
hung
on
the
wall
behind
his
chair
he
took
the
brass
hammer
and
struck
the
round
metal
plate
it
gave
a
feeble
sound
which
grew
and
vibrated
becoming
sharper
and
louder
till
it
finally
died
away
on
the
evening
breeze
the
servant
appeared
with
a
frowning
face
and
cast
angry
glances
at
the
tramp
as
if
her
faithful
instinct
had
warned
her
of
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
her
master
she
held
a
platter
on
which
was
the
sunfish
spreading
a
savory
odor
of
melted
butter
through
the
room
the
abbé
divided
the
fish
lengthwise
helping
his
son
to
the
better
half
i
caught
it
a
little
while
ago
he
said
with
a
touch
of
pride
in
spite
of
his
keen
distress
marguerite
had
not
left
the
room
the
priest
added
bring
us
some
wine
the
white
wine
of
cape
corse
she
almost
rebelled
and
the
priest
assuming
a
severe
expression
was
obliged
to
repeat
now
go
and
bring
two
bottles
remember
for
when
he
drank
with
anybody
a
very
rare
pleasure
indeed
he
always
opened
one
bottle
for
himself
beaming
remarked
fine
a
splendid
idea
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
such
a
dinner
the
servant
came
back
after
a
few
minutes
the
abbé
thought
it
an
eternity
for
now
a
thirst
for
information
burned
his
blood
like
infernal
fire
after
the
bottles
had
been
opened
the
woman
still
remained
her
eyes
glued
on
the
tramp
leave
us
said
the
curé
she
intentionally
ignored
his
command
he
repeated
almost
roughly
i
have
ordered
you
to
leave
us
then
she
left
the
room
devoured
the
fish
voraciously
while
his
father
sat
watching
him
more
and
more
surprised
and
saddened
at
all
the
baseness
stamped
on
the
face
that
was
so
like
his
own
the
morsels
the
abbé
raised
to
his
lips
remained
in
his
mouth
for
his
throat
could
not
swallow
so
he
ate
slowly
trying
to
choose
from
the
host
of
questions
which
besieged
his
mind
the
one
he
wished
his
son
to
answer
first
at
last
he
spoke
what
was
the
cause
of
her
death
consumption
was
she
ill
a
long
time
about
eighteen
months
how
did
she
contract
it
we
could
not
tell
both
men
were
silent
the
priest
was
reflecting
he
was
oppressed
by
the
multitude
of
things
he
wished
to
know
and
to
hear
for
since
the
rupture
since
the
day
he
had
tried
to
kill
her
he
had
heard
nothing
certainly
he
had
not
cared
to
know
because
he
had
buried
her
along
with
his
happiest
days
in
forgetfulness
but
now
knowing
that
she
was
dead
and
gone
he
felt
within
himself
the
almost
jealous
desire
of
a
lover
to
hear
all
he
continued
she
was
not
alone
was
she
no
she
lived
with
him
the
old
man
started
with
him
with
pravallon
why
yes
and
the
betrayed
man
rapidly
calculated
that
the
woman
who
had
deceived
him
had
lived
over
thirty
years
with
his
rival
almost
unconsciously
he
asked
were
they
happy
the
young
man
sneered
why
yes
with
ups
and
downs
it
would
have
been
better
had
i
not
been
there
i
always
spoiled
everything
how
and
why
inquired
the
priest
i
have
already
told
you
because
he
thought
i
was
his
son
up
to
my
fifteenth
year
but
the
old
fellow
was
a
fool
and
soon
discovered
the
likeness
that
created
scenes
i
used
to
listen
behind
the
door
he
accused
mother
of
having
deceived
him
mother
would
answer
it
my
fault
you
knew
quite
well
when
you
took
me
that
i
was
the
mistress
of
that
other
man
you
were
that
other
man
ah
they
spoke
of
me
sometimes
yes
but
never
mentioned
your
name
before
me
excepting
toward
the
end
when
mother
knew
she
was
lost
i
think
they
distrusted
me
and
you
and
you
learned
quite
early
the
irregularity
of
your
position
why
certainly
i
am
not
innocent
and
i
never
was
those
things
are
easy
to
guess
as
soon
as
one
begins
to
know
life
had
been
filling
his
glass
repeatedly
his
eyes
now
were
beginning
to
sparkle
for
his
long
fast
was
favorable
to
the
intoxicating
effects
of
the
wine
the
priest
noticed
it
and
wished
to
caution
him
but
suddenly
the
thought
that
a
drunkard
is
imprudent
and
loquacious
flashed
through
him
and
lifting
the
bottle
he
again
filled
the
young
man
glass
meanwhile
marguerite
had
brought
the
chicken
having
set
it
on
the
table
she
again
fastened
her
eyes
on
the
tramp
saying
in
an
indignant
voice
ca
you
see
that
he
drunk
monsieur
le
curé
leave
us
replied
the
priest
and
return
to
the
kitchen
she
went
out
slamming
the
door
he
then
inquired
what
did
your
mother
say
about
me
why
what
a
woman
usually
says
of
a
man
she
has
jilted
that
you
were
hard
to
get
along
with
very
strange
and
that
you
would
have
made
her
life
miserable
with
your
peculiar
ideas
did
she
say
that
often
yes
but
sometimes
only
in
allusions
for
fear
i
would
understand
but
nevertheless
i
guessed
all
and
how
did
they
treat
you
in
that
house
me
they
treated
me
very
well
at
first
and
very
badly
afterward
when
mother
saw
that
i
was
interfering
with
her
she
shook
me
how
how
very
easily
when
i
was
about
sixteen
years
old
i
got
into
various
scrapes
and
those
blackguards
put
me
into
a
reformatory
to
get
rid
of
me
he
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
rested
his
cheeks
in
his
palms
he
was
hopelessly
intoxicated
and
felt
the
unconquerable
desire
of
all
drunkards
to
talk
and
boast
about
themselves
he
smiled
sweetly
with
a
feminine
grace
an
arch
grace
the
priest
knew
and
recognized
as
the
hated
charm
that
had
won
him
long
ago
and
had
also
wrought
his
undoing
now
it
was
his
mother
whom
the
boy
resembled
not
so
much
because
of
his
features
but
because
of
his
fascinating
and
deceptive
glance
and
the
seductiveness
of
the
false
smile
that
played
around
his
lips
the
outlet
of
his
inner
ignominy
began
to
relate
ah
ah
ah
i
had
a
fine
life
since
i
left
the
reformatory
a
great
writer
would
pay
a
large
sum
for
it
why
old
père
dumas
monte
cristo
has
had
no
stranger
adventures
than
mine
he
paused
to
reflect
with
the
philosophical
gravity
of
the
drunkard
then
he
continued
slowly
when
you
wish
a
boy
to
turn
out
well
no
matter
what
he
has
done
never
send
him
to
a
reformatory
the
associations
are
too
bad
now
i
got
into
a
bad
scrape
one
night
about
nine
i
with
three
companions
we
were
all
a
little
drunk
was
walking
along
the
road
near
the
ford
of
folac
all
at
once
a
wagon
hove
in
sight
with
the
driver
and
his
family
asleep
in
it
they
were
people
from
martinon
on
their
way
home
from
town
i
caught
hold
of
the
bridle
led
the
horse
to
the
ferryboat
made
him
walk
into
it
and
pushed
the
boat
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
this
created
some
noise
and
the
driver
awoke
he
could
not
see
in
the
dark
but
whipped
up
the
horse
which
started
on
a
run
and
landed
in
the
water
with
the
whole
load
all
were
drowned
my
companions
denounced
me
to
the
authorities
though
they
thought
it
was
a
good
joke
when
they
saw
me
do
it
really
we
did
think
that
it
would
turn
out
that
way
we
only
wanted
to
give
the
people
a
ducking
just
for
fun
after
that
i
committed
worse
offenses
to
revenge
myself
for
the
first
one
which
did
not
on
my
honor
warrant
the
reformatory
but
what
the
use
of
telling
them
i
will
speak
only
of
the
latest
one
because
i
am
sure
it
will
please
you
papa
i
avenged
you
the
abbé
was
watching
his
son
with
terrified
eyes
he
had
stopped
eating
was
preparing
to
begin
no
not
yet
said
the
priest
in
a
little
while
and
he
turned
to
strike
the
chinese
gong
marguerite
appeared
almost
instantly
her
master
addressed
her
in
such
a
rough
tone
that
she
hung
her
head
thoroughly
frightened
and
obedient
bring
in
the
lamp
and
the
dessert
and
then
do
not
appear
until
i
summon
you
she
went
out
and
returned
with
a
porcelain
lamp
covered
with
a
green
shade
and
bringing
also
a
large
piece
of
cheese
and
some
fruit
after
she
had
gone
the
abbé
turned
resolutely
to
his
son
now
i
am
ready
to
hear
you
calmly
filled
his
plate
with
dessert
and
poured
wine
into
his
glass
the
second
bottle
was
nearly
empty
though
the
priest
had
not
touched
it
his
mouth
and
tongue
thick
with
food
and
wine
the
man
stuttered
well
now
for
the
last
job
and
it
a
good
one
i
was
home
again
stayed
there
in
spite
of
them
because
they
feared
me
yes
feared
me
ah
you
ca
fool
with
me
you
know
i
do
anything
when
i
roused
they
lived
together
on
and
off
the
old
man
had
two
residences
one
official
for
the
senator
the
other
clandestine
for
the
lover
still
he
lived
more
in
the
latter
than
in
the
former
as
he
could
not
get
along
without
mother
mother
was
a
sharp
one
she
knew
how
to
hold
a
man
she
had
taken
him
body
and
soul
and
kept
him
to
the
last
well
i
had
come
back
and
i
kept
them
down
by
fright
i
am
resourceful
at
times
nobody
can
match
me
for
sharpness
and
for
strength
too
i
afraid
of
no
one
well
mother
got
sick
and
the
old
man
took
her
to
a
fine
place
in
the
country
near
meulan
situated
in
a
park
as
big
as
a
wood
she
lasted
about
eighteen
months
as
i
told
you
then
we
felt
the
end
to
be
near
he
came
from
paris
every
day
he
was
very
miserable
really
one
morning
they
chatted
a
long
time
over
an
hour
i
think
and
i
could
not
imagine
what
they
were
talking
about
suddenly
mother
called
me
in
and
said
am
going
to
die
and
there
is
something
i
want
to
tell
you
beforehand
in
spite
of
the
count
advice
in
speaking
of
him
she
always
said
count
is
the
name
of
your
father
who
is
alive
i
had
asked
her
this
more
than
fifty
times
more
than
fifty
times
my
father
name
more
than
fifty
times
and
she
always
refused
to
tell
i
think
i
even
beat
her
one
day
to
make
her
talk
but
it
was
of
no
use
then
to
get
rid
of
me
she
told
me
that
you
had
died
penniless
that
you
were
worthless
and
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
her
youth
an
innocent
girl
mistake
she
lied
so
well
i
really
believed
you
had
died
finally
she
said
is
your
father
name
the
old
man
who
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
repeated
three
times
like
this
do
wrong
you
do
wrong
you
do
wrong
rosette
mother
sat
up
in
bed
i
can
see
her
now
with
her
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
she
loved
me
in
spite
of
everything
and
she
said
you
do
something
for
him
philippe
in
speaking
to
him
she
called
him
and
me
he
began
to
shout
like
a
madman
something
for
that
loafer
that
blackguard
that
convict
never
and
he
continued
to
call
me
names
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
else
all
his
life
but
collect
them
i
was
angry
but
mother
told
me
to
hold
my
tongue
and
she
resumed
you
must
want
him
to
starve
for
you
know
that
i
leave
no
money
without
being
deterred
he
continued
i
have
given
you
thousand
francs
a
year
for
thirty
years
that
makes
more
than
a
million
i
have
enabled
you
to
live
like
a
wealthy
a
beloved
and
i
may
say
a
happy
woman
i
owe
nothing
to
that
fellow
who
has
spoiled
our
late
years
and
he
will
not
get
a
cent
from
me
it
is
useless
to
insist
tell
him
the
name
of
his
father
if
you
wish
i
am
sorry
but
i
wash
my
hands
of
him
then
mother
turned
toward
me
i
thought
now
i
going
to
find
my
real
father
if
he
has
money
i
saved
she
went
on
father
the
baron
de
vilbois
is
the
abbé
vilbois
curé
of
garandou
near
toulon
he
was
my
lover
before
i
left
him
for
the
count
and
she
told
me
all
excepting
that
she
had
deceived
you
about
her
pregnancy
but
women
you
know
never
tell
the
whole
truth
sneeringly
unconsciously
he
was
revealing
the
depths
of
his
foul
nature
with
beaming
face
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
continued
mother
died
two
days
two
days
later
we
followed
her
remains
to
the
grave
he
and
i
say
was
it
funny
he
and
i
and
three
servants
that
was
all
he
cried
like
a
calf
we
were
side
by
side
we
looked
like
father
and
son
then
he
went
back
to
the
house
alone
i
was
thinking
to
myself
have
to
clear
out
now
and
without
a
penny
too
i
owned
only
fifty
francs
what
could
i
do
to
revenge
myself
he
touched
me
on
the
arm
and
said
wish
to
speak
to
you
i
followed
him
into
his
office
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
desk
and
wiping
away
his
tears
he
told
me
that
he
would
not
be
as
hard
on
me
as
he
had
said
he
would
to
mother
he
begged
me
to
leave
you
alone
that
that
concerns
only
you
and
me
he
offered
me
a
note
a
thousand
a
thousand
francs
what
could
a
fellow
like
me
do
with
a
thousand
francs
i
saw
that
there
were
very
many
bills
in
the
drawer
the
sight
of
the
money
made
me
wild
i
put
out
my
hand
as
if
to
take
the
note
he
offered
me
but
instead
of
doing
so
i
sprang
at
him
threw
him
to
the
ground
and
choked
him
till
he
grew
purple
when
i
saw
that
he
was
going
to
give
up
the
ghost
i
gagged
and
bound
him
then
i
undressed
him
laid
him
on
his
stomach
and
ah
ah
ah
i
avenged
you
in
a
funny
way
he
stopped
to
cough
for
he
was
choking
with
merriment
his
ferocious
mirthful
smile
reminded
the
priest
once
more
of
the
woman
who
had
wrought
his
undoing
and
then
he
inquired
then
ah
ah
ah
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
fireplace
it
was
in
the
winter
in
december
mother
died
a
bright
coal
fire
i
took
the
poker
i
let
it
get
and
i
made
crosses
on
his
back
eight
or
more
i
can
not
remember
how
many
then
i
turned
him
over
and
repeated
them
on
his
stomach
say
was
it
funny
papa
formerly
they
marked
convicts
in
this
way
he
wriggled
like
an
eel
but
i
had
gagged
him
so
that
he
could
scream
i
gathered
up
the
bills
twelve
in
all
with
mine
it
made
thirteen
an
unlucky
number
i
left
the
house
after
telling
the
servants
not
to
bother
their
master
until
because
he
was
asleep
i
thought
that
he
would
hush
the
matter
up
because
he
was
a
senator
and
would
fear
the
scandal
i
was
mistaken
four
days
later
i
was
arrested
in
a
paris
restaurant
i
got
three
years
for
the
job
that
is
the
reason
why
i
did
not
come
to
you
sooner
he
drank
again
and
stuttering
so
as
to
render
his
words
almost
unintelligible
continued
now
papa
is
it
funny
to
have
one
papa
a
curé
you
must
be
nice
to
me
very
nice
because
you
know
i
am
not
commonplace
and
i
did
a
good
job
did
i
on
the
old
man
the
anger
which
years
ago
had
driven
the
abbé
vilbois
to
desperation
rose
within
him
at
the
sight
of
this
miserable
man
he
who
in
the
name
of
the
lord
had
so
often
pardoned
the
infamous
secrets
whispered
to
him
under
the
seal
of
confession
was
now
merciless
in
his
own
behalf
no
longer
did
he
implore
the
help
of
a
merciful
god
for
he
realized
that
no
power
on
earth
or
in
the
sky
could
save
those
who
had
been
visited
by
such
a
terrible
disaster
all
the
ardor
of
his
passionate
heart
and
of
his
violent
blood
which
long
years
of
resignation
had
tempered
awoke
against
the
miserable
creature
who
was
his
son
he
protested
against
the
likeness
he
bore
to
him
and
to
his
mother
the
wretched
mother
who
had
formed
him
so
like
herself
and
he
rebelled
against
the
destiny
that
had
chained
this
criminal
to
him
like
an
iron
ball
to
a
the
shock
roused
him
from
the
peaceful
and
pious
slumber
which
had
lasted
years
with
a
wonderful
lucidity
he
saw
all
that
would
inevitably
ensue
convinced
that
he
must
talk
loud
so
as
to
intimidate
this
man
from
the
first
he
spoke
with
his
teeth
clenched
with
fury
now
that
you
have
told
all
listen
to
me
you
will
leave
here
morning
you
will
go
to
a
country
that
i
shall
designate
and
never
leave
it
without
my
permission
i
will
give
you
a
small
income
for
i
am
poor
if
you
disobey
me
once
it
will
be
withdrawn
and
you
will
learn
to
know
me
though
was
half
dazed
with
wine
he
understood
the
threat
instantly
the
criminal
within
him
rebelled
between
hiccoughs
he
sputtered
ah
papa
be
careful
what
you
say
you
a
curé
remember
i
hold
you
and
you
have
to
walk
straight
like
the
rest
the
abbé
started
through
his
whole
muscular
frame
crept
the
unconquerable
desire
to
seize
this
monster
to
bend
him
like
a
twig
so
as
to
show
him
that
he
would
have
to
yield
shaking
the
table
he
shouted
take
care
take
care
i
am
afraid
of
nobody
the
drunkard
lost
his
balance
and
seeing
that
he
was
going
to
fall
and
would
forthwith
be
in
the
priest
power
he
reached
with
a
murderous
look
for
one
of
the
knives
lying
on
the
table
the
abbé
perceived
his
motion
and
he
gave
the
table
a
terrible
shove
his
son
toppled
over
and
landed
on
his
back
the
lamp
fell
with
a
crash
and
went
out
during
a
moment
the
clinking
of
broken
glass
was
heard
in
the
darkness
then
the
muffled
sound
of
a
soft
body
creeping
on
the
floor
and
then
all
was
silent
with
the
crashing
of
the
lamp
a
complete
darkness
spread
over
them
it
was
so
prompt
and
unexpected
that
they
were
stunned
by
it
as
by
some
terrible
event
the
drunkard
pressed
against
the
wall
did
not
move
the
priest
remained
on
his
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
night
which
had
quelled
his
rage
the
somber
veil
that
had
descended
so
rapidly
arresting
his
anger
also
quieted
the
furious
impulses
of
his
soul
new
ideas
as
dark
and
dreary
as
the
obscurity
beset
him
the
room
was
perfectly
silent
like
a
tomb
where
nothing
draws
the
breath
of
life
not
a
sound
came
from
outside
neither
the
rumbling
of
a
distant
wagon
nor
the
bark
of
a
dog
nor
even
the
sigh
of
the
wind
passing
through
the
trees
this
lasted
a
long
time
perhaps
an
hour
then
suddenly
the
gong
vibrated
it
rang
once
as
if
it
had
been
struck
a
short
sharp
blow
and
was
instantly
followed
by
the
noise
of
a
falling
body
and
an
overturned
chair
marguerite
came
running
out
of
the
kitchen
but
as
soon
as
she
opened
the
door
she
fell
back
frightened
by
the
intense
darkness
trembling
her
heart
beating
as
if
it
would
burst
she
called
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
le
curé
le
curé
nobody
answered
nothing
stirred
dieu
mon
she
thought
what
has
happened
what
have
they
done
she
did
not
dare
enter
the
room
yet
feared
to
go
back
to
fetch
a
light
she
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
run
away
to
screech
at
the
top
of
her
voice
though
she
knew
her
legs
would
refuse
to
carry
her
she
repeated
le
curé
le
curé
it
is
me
marguerite
but
notwithstanding
her
terror
the
instinctive
desire
of
helping
her
master
and
a
woman
courage
which
is
sometimes
heroic
filled
her
soul
with
a
terrified
audacity
and
running
back
to
the
kitchen
she
fetched
a
lamp
she
stopped
at
the
doorsill
first
she
caught
sight
of
the
tramp
lying
against
the
wall
asleep
or
simulating
slumber
then
she
saw
the
broken
lamp
and
then
under
the
table
the
feet
and
legs
of
the
priest
who
must
have
fallen
backward
striking
his
head
on
the
gong
her
teeth
chattering
and
her
hands
trembling
with
fright
she
kept
on
repeating
my
god
my
god
what
is
this
she
advanced
slowly
taking
small
steps
till
she
slid
on
something
slimy
and
almost
fell
stooping
she
saw
that
the
floor
was
red
and
that
a
red
liquid
was
spreading
around
her
feet
toward
the
door
she
guessed
that
it
was
blood
she
threw
down
her
light
so
as
to
hide
the
sight
of
it
and
fled
from
the
room
out
into
the
fields
running
half
crazed
toward
the
village
she
ran
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
bumping
against
the
trees
she
did
not
heed
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
gleaming
lights
of
the
distant
town
her
shrill
voice
rang
out
like
the
gloomy
cry
of
the
repeating
continuously
the
maoufatan
the
maoufatan
the
maoufatan
when
she
reached
the
first
house
some
excited
men
came
out
and
surrounded
her
but
she
could
not
answer
them
and
struggled
to
escape
for
the
fright
had
turned
her
head
after
a
while
they
guessed
that
something
must
have
happened
to
the
curé
and
a
little
rescuing
party
started
for
the
lodge
the
little
pink
house
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
olive
grove
had
grown
black
and
invisible
in
the
dark
silent
night
since
the
gleam
of
the
solitary
window
had
faded
the
cabin
was
plunged
in
darkness
lost
in
the
grove
and
unrecognizable
for
anyone
but
a
native
of
the
place
soon
lights
began
to
gleam
near
the
ground
between
the
trees
streaking
the
dried
grass
with
long
yellow
reflections
the
twisted
trunks
of
the
assumed
fantastic
shapes
under
the
moving
lights
looking
like
monsters
or
infernal
serpents
the
projected
reflections
suddenly
revealed
a
vague
white
mass
and
soon
the
low
square
wall
of
the
lodge
grew
pink
from
the
light
of
the
lanterns
several
peasants
were
carrying
the
latter
escorting
two
gendarmes
with
revolvers
the
mayor
the
and
marguerite
supported
by
the
men
for
she
was
almost
unable
to
walk
the
rescuing
party
hesitated
a
moment
in
front
of
the
open
grewsome
door
but
the
brigadier
snatching
a
lantern
from
one
of
the
men
entered
followed
by
the
rest
the
servant
had
not
lied
blood
covered
the
floor
like
a
carpet
it
had
spread
to
the
place
where
the
tramp
was
lying
bathing
one
of
his
hands
and
legs
the
father
and
son
were
asleep
the
one
with
a
severed
throat
the
other
in
a
drunken
stupor
the
two
gendarmes
seized
the
latter
and
before
he
awoke
they
had
him
handcuffed
he
rubbed
his
eyes
stunned
stupefied
with
liquor
and
when
he
saw
the
body
of
the
priest
he
appeared
terrified
unable
to
understand
what
had
happened
why
did
he
not
escape
said
the
mayor
he
was
too
drunk
replied
the
officer
and
every
man
agreed
with
him
for
nobody
ever
thought
that
perhaps
the
abbé
vilbois
had
taken
his
own
life
revenge
as
they
were
still
speaking
of
pranzini
maloureau
who
had
been
under
the
empire
said
i
knew
another
case
like
that
a
very
curious
affair
curious
from
many
points
as
you
shall
see
i
was
at
that
time
imperial
attorney
in
the
province
and
stood
very
well
at
court
thanks
to
my
father
who
was
first
president
at
paris
i
had
charge
of
a
still
celebrated
case
called
affair
of
schoolmaster
moiron
moiron
a
schoolmaster
in
the
north
of
france
bore
an
excellent
reputation
in
all
the
country
thereabout
he
was
an
intelligent
reflective
very
religious
man
and
had
married
in
the
district
of
boislinot
where
he
practiced
his
profession
he
had
had
three
children
who
all
died
in
succession
from
weak
lungs
after
the
loss
of
his
own
little
ones
he
seemed
to
lavish
upon
the
urchins
confided
to
his
care
all
the
tenderness
concealed
in
his
heart
he
bought
with
his
own
pennies
playthings
for
his
best
pupils
the
diligent
and
good
he
allowed
them
to
have
play
dinners
and
gorged
them
with
dainties
of
candies
and
cakes
everybody
loved
and
praised
this
brave
man
this
brave
heart
and
it
was
like
a
blow
when
five
of
his
pupils
died
of
the
same
disease
that
had
carried
off
his
children
it
was
believed
that
an
epidemic
prevailed
caused
by
the
water
being
made
impure
from
drought
they
looked
for
the
cause
without
discovering
it
more
than
they
did
at
the
symptoms
which
were
very
strange
the
children
appeared
to
be
taken
with
a
languor
could
eat
nothing
complained
of
pains
in
the
stomach
and
finally
died
in
most
terrible
agony
an
autopsy
was
made
of
the
last
to
die
but
nothing
was
discovered
the
entrails
were
sent
to
paris
and
analyzed
but
showed
no
sign
of
any
toxic
substance
for
one
year
no
further
deaths
occurred
then
two
little
boys
the
best
pupils
in
the
class
favorites
of
father
moiron
expired
in
four
days
time
an
examination
was
ordered
and
in
each
body
fragments
of
pounded
glass
were
found
imbedded
in
the
organs
they
concluded
that
the
two
children
had
eaten
imprudently
of
something
carelessly
prepared
sufficient
broken
glass
remained
in
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
of
milk
to
have
caused
this
frightful
accident
and
the
matter
would
have
rested
there
had
not
moiron
servant
been
taken
ill
in
the
interval
the
physician
found
the
same
morbid
signs
that
he
observed
in
the
preceding
attacks
of
the
children
and
upon
questioning
her
finally
obtained
the
confession
that
she
had
stolen
and
eaten
some
bonbons
bought
by
the
master
for
his
pupils
upon
order
of
the
court
the
schoolhouse
was
searched
and
a
closet
was
found
full
of
sweetmeats
and
dainties
for
the
children
nearly
all
these
edibles
contained
fragments
of
glass
or
broken
needles
moiron
was
immediately
arrested
he
was
so
indignant
and
stupefied
at
the
weight
of
suspicion
upon
him
that
he
was
nearly
overcome
nevertheless
the
indications
of
his
guilt
were
so
apparent
that
they
fought
hard
in
my
mind
against
my
first
conviction
which
was
based
upon
his
good
reputation
his
entire
life
of
truthfulness
and
the
absolute
absence
of
any
motive
for
such
a
crime
why
should
this
good
simple
religious
man
kill
children
and
the
children
whom
he
seemed
to
love
best
why
should
he
select
those
he
had
feasted
with
dainties
for
whom
he
had
spent
in
playthings
and
bonbons
half
his
stipend
to
admit
this
it
must
be
concluded
that
he
was
insane
but
moiron
seemed
so
reasonable
so
calm
so
full
of
judgment
and
good
sense
it
was
impossible
to
prove
insanity
in
him
proofs
accumulated
nevertheless
bonbons
cakes
of
marshmallow
and
other
things
seized
at
the
shops
where
the
schoolmaster
got
his
supplies
were
found
to
contain
no
suspected
fragment
he
pretended
that
some
unknown
enemy
had
opened
his
closet
with
a
false
key
and
placed
the
glass
and
needles
in
the
eatables
and
he
implied
a
story
of
heritage
dependent
on
the
death
of
a
child
sought
out
and
discovered
by
a
peasant
and
so
worked
up
as
to
make
the
suspicion
fall
upon
the
schoolmaster
this
brute
he
said
was
not
interested
in
the
other
poor
children
who
had
to
die
also
this
theory
was
plausible
the
man
appeared
so
sure
of
himself
and
so
pitiful
that
we
should
have
acquitted
him
without
doubt
if
two
overwhelming
discoveries
had
not
been
made
at
one
blow
the
first
was
a
snuffbox
full
of
ground
glass
it
was
his
own
snuffbox
in
a
secret
drawer
of
his
secretary
where
he
kept
his
money
he
explained
this
in
a
manner
not
acceptable
by
saying
that
it
was
the
last
ruse
of
an
unknown
guilty
one
but
a
merchant
of
presented
himself
at
the
house
of
the
judge
telling
him
that
moiron
had
bought
needles
of
him
many
times
the
finest
needles
he
could
find
breaking
them
to
see
whether
they
suited
him
the
merchant
brought
as
witnesses
a
dozen
persons
who
recognized
moiron
at
first
glance
and
the
inquest
revealed
the
fact
that
the
schoolmaster
was
at
on
the
days
designated
by
the
merchant
i
pass
over
the
terrible
depositions
of
the
children
upon
the
choice
of
dainties
and
his
care
in
making
the
little
ones
eat
in
his
presence
and
destroying
all
traces
of
the
feast
public
opinion
exasperated
recalled
capital
punishment
and
took
on
a
new
force
from
terror
which
permitted
no
delays
or
resistance
moiron
was
condemned
to
death
his
appeal
was
rejected
no
recourse
remained
to
him
for
pardon
i
knew
from
my
father
that
the
emperor
would
not
grant
it
one
morning
as
i
was
at
work
in
my
office
the
chaplain
of
the
prison
was
announced
he
was
an
old
priest
who
had
a
great
knowledge
of
men
and
a
large
acquaintance
among
criminals
he
appeared
troubled
and
constrained
after
talking
a
few
moments
of
other
things
he
said
abruptly
on
rising
moiron
is
decapitated
monsieur
you
will
have
allowed
the
execution
of
an
innocent
man
then
without
bowing
he
went
out
leaving
me
under
the
profound
effect
of
his
words
he
had
pronounced
them
in
a
solemn
affecting
fashion
opening
lips
closed
and
sealed
by
confession
in
order
to
save
a
life
an
hour
later
i
was
on
my
way
to
paris
and
my
father
at
my
request
asked
an
immediate
audience
with
the
emperor
i
was
received
the
next
day
napoleon
iii
was
at
work
in
a
little
room
when
we
were
introduced
i
exposed
the
whole
affair
even
to
the
visit
of
the
priest
and
in
the
midst
of
the
story
the
door
opened
behind
the
chair
of
the
emperor
and
the
empress
who
believed
in
him
alone
entered
his
majesty
consulted
her
when
she
had
run
over
the
facts
she
exclaimed
man
must
be
pardoned
he
must
because
he
is
innocent
why
should
this
sudden
conviction
of
a
woman
so
pious
throw
into
my
mind
a
terrible
doubt
up
to
that
time
i
had
ardently
desired
a
commutation
of
the
sentence
and
now
i
felt
myself
the
puppet
the
dupe
of
a
criminal
ruse
which
had
employed
the
priest
and
the
confession
as
a
means
of
defense
i
showed
some
hesitation
to
their
majesties
the
emperor
remained
undecided
solicited
on
one
hand
by
his
natural
goodness
and
on
the
other
held
back
by
the
fear
of
allowing
himself
to
play
a
miserable
part
but
the
empress
convinced
that
the
priest
had
obeyed
a
divine
call
repeated
does
it
matter
it
is
better
to
spare
a
guilty
man
than
to
kill
an
innocent
one
her
advice
prevailed
the
penalty
of
death
was
commuted
and
that
of
hard
labor
was
substituted
some
years
after
i
heard
that
moiron
whose
exemplary
conduct
at
toulon
had
been
made
known
again
to
the
emperor
was
employed
as
a
domestic
by
the
director
of
the
penitentiary
and
then
i
heard
no
word
of
this
man
for
a
long
time
about
two
years
after
this
when
i
was
passing
the
summer
at
the
house
of
my
cousin
de
larielle
a
young
priest
came
to
me
one
evening
as
we
were
sitting
down
to
dinner
and
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
told
them
to
let
him
come
in
and
he
begged
me
to
go
with
him
to
a
dying
man
who
desired
before
all
else
to
see
me
this
had
happened
often
during
my
long
career
as
judge
and
although
i
had
been
put
aside
by
the
republic
i
was
still
called
upon
from
time
to
time
in
like
circumstances
i
followed
the
ecclesiastic
who
made
me
mount
into
a
little
miserable
lodging
under
the
roof
of
a
high
house
there
upon
a
pallet
of
straw
i
found
a
dying
man
seated
with
his
back
against
the
wall
in
order
to
breathe
he
was
a
sort
of
grimacing
skeleton
with
deep
shining
eyes
when
he
saw
me
he
murmured
do
not
know
me
am
moiron
i
shivered
but
said
schoolmaster
is
it
you
are
here
would
be
too
long
i
have
time
i
am
going
to
die
they
brought
me
this
curate
and
as
i
knew
you
were
here
i
sent
him
for
you
it
is
to
you
that
i
wish
to
confess
since
you
saved
my
life
before
the
other
time
he
seized
with
his
dry
hands
the
straw
of
his
bed
and
continued
in
a
rasping
bass
voice
it
is
i
owe
you
the
truth
to
you
because
it
is
necessary
to
tell
it
to
some
one
before
leaving
the
earth
was
i
who
killed
the
children
all
it
was
i
for
vengeance
i
was
an
honest
man
very
honest
very
honest
very
pure
adoring
god
the
good
god
the
god
that
they
teach
us
to
love
and
not
the
false
god
the
executioner
the
robber
the
murderer
who
governs
the
earth
i
had
never
done
wrong
never
committed
a
villainous
act
i
was
pure
as
one
unborn
i
was
married
i
had
some
children
and
i
began
to
love
them
as
never
father
or
mother
loved
their
own
i
lived
only
for
them
i
was
foolish
they
died
all
three
of
them
why
why
what
had
i
done
i
i
had
a
change
of
heart
a
furious
change
suddenly
i
opened
my
eyes
as
of
one
awakening
and
i
learned
that
god
is
wicked
why
had
he
killed
my
children
i
opened
my
eyes
and
i
saw
that
he
loved
to
kill
he
loves
only
that
monsieur
he
exists
only
to
destroy
god
is
a
murderer
some
death
is
necessary
to
him
every
day
he
causes
them
in
all
fashions
the
better
to
amuse
himself
he
has
invented
sickness
and
accident
in
order
to
divert
himself
through
all
the
long
months
and
years
and
when
he
is
weary
he
has
epidemics
pests
the
cholera
quinsy
smallpox
do
i
know
all
that
this
monster
has
imagined
all
these
evils
are
not
enough
to
suffice
from
time
to
time
he
sends
war
in
order
to
see
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
laid
low
bruised
in
blood
and
mire
with
arms
and
legs
torn
off
heads
broken
by
bullets
like
eggs
that
fall
along
the
road
is
not
all
he
has
made
men
who
eat
one
another
and
then
as
men
become
better
than
he
he
has
made
beasts
to
see
the
men
chase
them
slaughter
and
nourish
themselves
with
them
that
is
not
all
he
has
made
all
the
little
animals
that
live
for
a
day
flies
which
increase
by
myriads
in
an
hour
ants
that
one
crushes
and
others
many
so
many
that
we
can
not
even
imagine
them
and
all
kill
one
another
chase
one
another
devour
one
another
murdering
without
ceasing
and
the
good
god
looks
on
and
is
amused
because
he
sees
all
for
himself
the
largest
as
well
as
the
smallest
those
which
are
in
drops
of
water
as
well
as
those
in
the
stars
he
looks
at
them
all
and
is
amused
ugh
beast
i
monsieur
i
also
have
killed
some
children
i
acted
the
part
for
him
it
was
not
he
who
had
them
it
was
not
he
it
was
i
and
i
would
have
killed
still
more
but
you
took
me
away
that
all
was
going
to
die
guillotined
i
how
he
would
have
laughed
the
reptile
then
i
asked
for
a
priest
and
lied
to
him
i
confessed
i
lied
and
i
lived
it
is
finished
i
can
no
longer
escape
him
but
i
have
no
fear
of
him
monsieur
i
understand
him
too
well
it
was
frightful
to
see
this
miserable
creature
hardly
able
to
breathe
talking
in
hiccoughs
opening
an
enormous
mouth
to
eject
some
words
scarcely
heard
pulling
up
the
cloth
of
his
straw
bed
and
under
a
cover
nearly
black
moving
his
meager
limbs
as
if
to
save
himself
oh
frightful
being
and
frightful
remembrance
i
asked
him
have
nothing
more
to
say
monsieur
farewell
sir
one
day
or
the
other
i
turned
toward
the
priest
whose
somber
silhouette
was
on
the
wall
will
remain
m
abbé
will
remain
then
the
dying
man
sneered
yes
he
sends
crows
to
dead
bodies
as
for
me
i
had
seen
enough
i
opened
the
door
and
went
away
in
an
old
maid
in
argenteuil
they
called
her
queen
hortense
no
one
ever
knew
the
reason
why
perhaps
because
she
spoke
firmly
like
an
officer
in
command
perhaps
because
she
was
large
bony
and
imperious
perhaps
because
she
governed
a
multitude
of
domestic
animals
hens
dogs
cats
canaries
and
parrots
those
animals
so
dear
to
old
maids
but
she
gave
these
familiar
subjects
neither
dainties
nor
pretty
words
nor
those
tender
puerilities
which
seem
to
slip
from
the
lips
of
a
woman
to
the
velvety
coat
of
the
cat
she
is
fondling
she
governed
her
beasts
with
authority
she
ruled
she
was
an
old
maid
one
of
those
old
maids
with
cracked
voice
and
awkward
gesture
whose
soul
seems
hard
she
never
allowed
contradiction
from
any
person
nor
argument
nor
would
she
tolerate
hesitation
or
indifference
or
idleness
or
fatigue
no
one
ever
heard
her
complain
or
regret
what
was
or
desire
what
was
not
each
to
his
part
she
said
with
the
conviction
of
a
fatalist
she
never
went
to
church
cared
nothing
for
the
priests
scarcely
believed
in
god
and
called
all
religious
things
mourning
merchandise
for
thirty
years
she
had
lived
in
her
little
house
with
its
tiny
garden
in
front
extending
along
the
street
never
modifying
her
garments
changing
only
maids
and
that
mercilessly
when
they
became
years
old
she
replaced
without
tears
and
without
regrets
her
dogs
or
cats
or
birds
when
they
died
of
old
age
or
by
accident
and
she
buried
trespassing
animals
in
a
heaping
the
earth
above
them
and
treading
it
down
with
perfect
indifference
she
had
in
the
town
some
acquaintances
the
families
of
employers
whose
men
went
to
paris
every
day
sometimes
they
would
invite
her
to
go
to
the
theater
with
them
she
inevitably
fell
asleep
on
these
occasions
and
they
were
obliged
to
wake
her
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
she
never
allowed
anyone
to
accompany
her
having
no
fear
by
night
or
day
she
seemed
to
have
no
love
for
children
she
occupied
her
time
with
a
thousand
masculine
cares
carpentry
gardening
cutting
or
sawing
wood
repairing
her
old
house
even
doing
mason
work
when
it
was
necessary
she
had
some
relatives
who
came
to
see
her
twice
a
year
her
two
sisters
madame
cimme
and
madame
columbel
were
married
one
to
a
florist
the
other
to
a
small
householder
madame
cimme
had
no
children
madame
columbel
had
three
henry
pauline
and
joseph
henry
was
pauline
and
joseph
were
three
having
come
when
one
would
have
thought
the
mother
past
the
age
no
tenderness
united
this
old
maid
to
her
kinsfolk
in
the
spring
of
queen
hortense
became
suddenly
ill
the
neighbors
went
for
a
physician
whom
she
drove
away
when
the
priest
presented
himself
she
got
out
of
bed
half
naked
and
put
him
out
of
doors
the
little
maid
weeping
made
gruel
for
her
after
three
days
in
bed
the
situation
became
so
grave
that
the
carpenter
living
next
door
after
counsel
with
the
physician
now
reinstated
with
authority
took
it
upon
himself
to
summon
the
two
families
they
arrived
by
the
same
train
about
ten
in
the
morning
the
columbels
having
brought
their
little
joseph
when
they
approached
the
garden
gate
they
saw
the
maid
seated
in
a
chair
against
the
wall
weeping
the
dog
lay
asleep
on
the
mat
before
the
door
under
a
broiling
sun
two
cats
that
looked
as
if
dead
lay
stretched
out
on
the
with
eyes
closed
and
paws
and
tails
extended
at
full
length
a
great
glossy
hen
was
promenading
before
the
door
at
the
head
of
a
flock
of
chickens
covered
with
yellow
down
and
in
a
large
cage
hung
against
the
wall
covered
with
chickweed
were
several
birds
singing
themselves
hoarse
in
the
light
of
this
hot
spring
morning
two
others
inseparable
in
a
little
cage
in
the
form
of
a
cottage
remained
quiet
side
by
side
on
their
perch
cimme
a
large
wheezy
personage
who
always
entered
a
room
first
putting
aside
men
and
women
when
it
was
necessary
remarked
to
the
maid
eh
celeste
is
it
so
bad
as
that
the
little
maid
sobbed
through
her
tears
she
does
know
me
any
more
the
doctor
says
it
is
the
end
they
all
looked
at
one
another
madame
cimme
and
madame
columbel
embraced
each
other
instantly
not
saying
a
word
they
resembled
each
other
much
always
wearing
braids
of
hair
and
shawls
of
red
cashmere
as
bright
as
hot
coals
cimme
turned
toward
his
a
pale
man
yellow
and
thin
tormented
by
indigestion
who
limped
badly
and
said
to
him
in
a
serious
tone
gad
it
was
time
but
no
one
dared
to
go
into
the
room
of
the
dying
woman
situated
on
the
ground
floor
cimme
himself
stopped
at
that
step
columbel
was
the
first
to
decide
upon
it
he
entered
balancing
himself
like
the
mast
of
a
ship
making
a
noise
on
the
floor
with
the
iron
of
his
cane
the
two
women
ventured
to
follow
and
cimme
brought
up
the
line
little
joseph
remained
outside
playing
with
the
dog
a
ray
of
sunlight
fell
on
the
bed
lighting
up
the
hands
which
moved
nervously
opening
and
shutting
without
ceasing
the
fingers
moved
as
if
a
thought
animated
them
as
if
they
would
signify
something
indicate
some
idea
obey
some
intelligence
the
rest
of
the
body
remained
motionless
under
the
covers
the
angular
figure
gave
no
start
the
eyes
remained
closed
the
relatives
arranged
themselves
in
a
semicircle
and
without
saying
a
word
regarded
the
heaving
breast
and
the
short
breathing
the
little
maid
had
followed
them
still
shedding
tears
finally
cimme
asked
what
was
it
the
doctor
said
the
servant
whispered
he
said
we
should
leave
her
quiet
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
suddenly
the
lips
of
the
old
maid
began
to
move
she
seemed
to
pronounce
some
silent
words
concealed
in
her
dying
brain
and
her
hands
quickened
their
singular
movement
then
she
spoke
in
a
little
thin
voice
quite
unlike
her
own
an
utterance
that
seemed
to
come
from
far
off
perhaps
from
the
bottom
of
that
heart
always
closed
cimme
walked
upon
tiptoe
finding
this
spectacle
painful
columbel
whose
lame
leg
wearied
him
sat
down
the
two
women
remained
standing
queen
hortense
muttered
something
quickly
which
they
were
unable
to
understand
she
pronounced
some
names
called
tenderly
some
imaginary
persons
come
here
my
little
philip
kiss
your
mother
you
love
mamma
you
my
child
you
rose
you
will
watch
your
little
sister
while
i
am
out
especially
do
leave
her
alone
do
you
hear
and
i
forbid
you
to
touch
matches
she
was
silent
some
seconds
then
in
a
loud
tone
as
if
she
would
call
she
said
henrietta
she
waited
a
little
and
continued
tell
your
father
to
come
and
speak
to
me
before
going
to
his
office
then
suddenly
i
am
suffering
a
little
dear
promise
me
you
will
not
return
late
you
will
tell
your
chief
that
i
am
you
know
it
is
dangerous
to
leave
the
children
alone
when
i
am
in
bed
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
dish
of
rice
and
sugar
for
dinner
the
little
ones
like
it
so
much
claire
will
be
the
happy
one
she
began
to
laugh
a
young
and
noisy
laugh
as
she
had
never
laughed
before
look
john
she
said
what
a
droll
head
he
has
he
has
smeared
himself
with
the
sugarplums
the
dirty
thing
look
my
dear
how
funny
he
looks
columbel
who
changed
the
position
of
his
lame
leg
every
moment
murmured
she
is
dreaming
that
she
has
children
and
a
husband
the
end
is
near
the
two
sisters
did
not
move
but
seemed
surprised
and
stupid
the
little
maid
said
will
you
take
off
your
hats
and
your
shawls
and
go
into
the
other
room
they
went
out
without
having
said
a
word
and
columbel
followed
them
limping
leaving
the
dying
woman
alone
again
when
they
were
relieved
of
their
outer
garments
the
women
seated
themselves
then
one
of
the
cats
left
the
window
stretched
herself
jumped
into
the
room
then
upon
the
knees
of
madame
cimme
who
began
to
caress
her
they
heard
from
the
next
room
the
voice
of
agony
living
without
doubt
in
this
last
hour
the
life
she
had
expected
living
her
dreams
at
the
very
moment
when
all
would
be
finished
for
her
cimme
in
the
garden
played
with
the
little
joseph
and
the
dog
amusing
himself
much
with
the
gaiety
of
a
great
man
in
the
country
without
thought
of
the
dying
woman
but
suddenly
he
entered
addressing
the
maid
say
then
my
girl
are
you
going
to
give
us
some
luncheon
what
are
you
going
to
eat
ladies
they
decided
upon
an
omelet
of
fine
herbs
a
piece
of
fillet
with
new
potatoes
a
cheese
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
as
madame
columbel
was
fumbling
in
her
pocket
for
her
purse
cimme
stopped
her
and
turning
to
the
maid
said
you
need
money
and
she
answered
yes
sir
how
much
fifteen
francs
very
well
make
haste
now
my
girl
because
i
am
getting
hungry
madame
cimme
looking
out
at
the
climbing
flowers
bathed
in
the
sunlight
and
at
two
pigeons
making
love
on
the
roof
opposite
said
with
a
wounded
air
it
is
unfortunate
to
have
come
for
so
sad
an
event
it
would
be
nice
in
the
country
her
sister
sighed
without
response
and
columbel
murmured
moved
perhaps
by
the
thought
of
a
walk
my
leg
plagues
me
awfully
little
joseph
and
the
dog
made
a
terrible
noise
one
shouting
with
joy
and
the
other
barking
violently
they
played
at
around
the
three
running
after
each
other
like
mad
the
dying
woman
continued
to
call
her
children
chatting
with
each
imagining
that
she
was
dressing
them
that
she
caressed
them
that
she
was
teaching
them
to
read
come
simon
repeat
a
b
c
you
do
not
say
it
well
see
d
d
d
do
you
hear
repeat
then
cimme
declared
it
is
curious
what
she
talks
about
at
this
time
then
said
madame
columbel
it
would
be
better
perhaps
to
go
in
there
but
cimme
dissuaded
her
from
it
why
go
in
since
we
are
not
able
to
do
anything
for
her
besides
we
are
as
well
off
here
no
one
insisted
madame
observed
the
two
green
birds
called
inseparable
she
remarked
pleasantly
upon
this
singular
fidelity
and
blamed
men
for
not
imitating
these
little
creatures
cimme
looked
at
his
wife
and
laughed
singing
with
a
bantering
air
as
if
to
say
he
could
tell
some
things
about
her
fidelity
to
him
columbel
taken
with
cramps
in
his
stomach
struck
the
floor
with
his
cane
the
other
cat
entered
tail
in
the
air
they
did
not
sit
down
at
table
until
one
when
he
had
tasted
the
wine
columbel
whom
some
one
had
recommended
to
drink
only
choice
bordeaux
called
the
servant
say
is
there
nothing
better
than
this
in
the
cellar
yes
sir
there
is
some
of
the
wine
that
was
served
to
you
when
you
were
here
before
oh
well
go
and
bring
three
bottles
they
tasted
this
wine
which
seemed
excellent
not
that
it
proved
to
be
remarkable
but
it
had
been
fifteen
years
in
the
cellar
cimme
declared
it
was
just
the
wine
for
sickness
columbel
seized
with
a
desire
of
possessing
some
of
it
asked
of
the
maid
how
much
is
left
of
it
my
girl
oh
nearly
all
sir
miss
never
drinks
any
of
it
it
is
the
heap
at
the
bottom
then
columbel
turned
toward
his
if
you
wish
cimme
i
will
take
this
wine
instead
of
anything
else
it
agrees
with
my
stomach
wonderfully
the
hen
in
her
turn
had
entered
with
her
troop
of
chickens
the
two
women
amused
themselves
by
throwing
crumbs
to
them
joseph
and
the
dog
who
had
eaten
enough
returned
to
the
garden
queen
hortense
spoke
continually
but
the
voice
was
lower
now
so
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
distinguish
the
words
when
they
had
finished
the
coffee
they
all
went
in
to
learn
the
condition
of
the
sick
one
she
seemed
calm
they
went
out
and
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
in
the
garden
to
aid
digestion
presently
the
dog
began
to
run
around
the
chairs
with
all
speed
carrying
something
in
his
mouth
the
child
ran
after
him
violently
both
disappeared
into
the
house
cimme
fell
asleep
with
his
stomach
in
the
sun
the
dying
one
began
to
speak
loud
again
then
suddenly
she
shouted
the
two
women
and
columbel
hastened
in
to
see
what
had
happened
cimme
awakened
but
did
not
move
liking
better
things
as
they
were
the
dying
woman
was
sitting
up
staring
with
haggard
eyes
her
dog
to
escape
the
pursuit
of
little
joseph
had
jumped
upon
the
bed
startling
her
from
the
death
agony
the
dog
was
intrenched
behind
the
pillow
peeping
at
his
comrade
with
eyes
glistening
ready
to
jump
again
at
the
least
movement
he
held
in
his
mouth
one
of
the
slippers
of
his
mistress
shorn
of
its
heel
in
the
hour
he
had
played
with
it
the
child
intimidated
by
the
woman
rising
so
suddenly
before
him
remained
motionless
before
the
bed
the
hen
having
just
entered
had
jumped
upon
a
chair
frightened
by
the
noise
she
called
desperately
to
her
chickens
which
peeped
frightened
from
under
the
four
legs
of
the
seat
queen
hortense
cried
out
with
a
piercing
tone
no
no
i
do
not
wish
to
die
i
am
not
willing
who
will
bring
up
my
children
who
will
care
for
them
who
will
love
them
no
i
am
not
willing
i
am
not
she
turned
on
her
back
all
was
over
the
dog
much
excited
jumped
into
the
room
and
skipped
about
columbel
ran
to
the
window
and
called
his
come
quickly
come
quickly
i
believe
she
is
gone
then
cimme
got
up
and
resolutely
went
into
the
room
muttering
it
was
not
as
long
as
i
should
have
believed
complication
after
swearing
for
a
long
time
that
he
would
never
marry
jack
boudillère
suddenly
changed
his
mind
it
happened
one
summer
at
the
seashore
quite
unexpectedly
one
morning
as
he
was
extended
on
the
sand
watching
the
women
come
out
of
the
water
a
little
foot
caught
his
attention
because
of
its
slimness
and
delicacy
raising
his
eyes
higher
the
entire
person
seemed
attractive
of
this
entire
person
he
had
however
seen
only
the
ankles
and
the
head
emerging
from
a
white
flannel
bathing
suit
fastened
with
care
he
may
be
called
sensuous
and
impressionable
but
it
was
by
grace
of
form
alone
that
he
was
captured
afterward
he
was
held
by
the
charm
and
sweet
spirit
of
the
young
girl
who
was
simple
and
good
and
fresh
like
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
presented
to
the
family
he
was
pleased
and
straightway
became
when
he
saw
bertha
lannis
at
a
distance
on
the
long
stretch
of
yellow
sand
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
near
her
he
was
dumb
incapable
of
saying
anything
or
even
of
thinking
with
a
kind
of
bubbling
in
his
heart
a
humming
in
his
ears
and
a
frightened
feeling
in
his
mind
was
this
love
he
did
not
know
he
understood
nothing
of
it
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
fully
decided
to
make
this
child
his
wife
her
parents
hesitated
a
long
time
deterred
by
the
bad
reputation
of
the
young
man
he
had
a
mistress
it
was
said
an
old
mistress
an
old
and
strong
entanglement
one
of
those
chains
that
is
believed
to
be
broken
but
which
continues
to
hold
nevertheless
beyond
this
he
had
loved
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
every
woman
who
had
come
within
reach
of
his
lips
but
he
withdrew
from
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
lived
not
even
consenting
to
see
her
again
a
friend
arranged
her
pension
assuring
her
a
subsistence
jack
paid
but
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
to
her
pretending
henceforth
that
he
did
not
know
her
name
she
wrote
letters
which
he
would
not
open
each
week
brought
him
a
new
disguise
in
the
handwriting
of
the
abandoned
one
each
week
a
greater
anger
developed
in
him
against
her
and
he
would
tear
the
envelope
in
two
without
opening
it
without
reading
a
line
knowing
beforehand
the
reproaches
and
complaints
of
the
contents
one
could
scarcely
credit
her
perseverance
which
lasted
the
whole
winter
long
and
it
was
not
until
spring
that
her
demand
was
satisfied
the
marriage
took
place
in
paris
during
the
early
part
of
may
it
was
decided
that
they
should
not
take
the
regular
wedding
journey
after
a
little
ball
composed
of
a
company
of
young
cousins
who
would
not
stay
past
eleven
and
would
not
prolong
forever
the
cares
of
the
day
of
ceremony
the
young
couple
intended
to
pass
their
first
night
at
the
family
home
and
to
set
out
the
next
morning
for
the
seaside
where
they
had
met
and
loved
the
night
came
and
they
were
dancing
in
the
great
the
pair
had
withdrawn
from
the
rest
into
a
little
japanese
boudoir
shut
off
by
silk
hangings
and
scarcely
lighted
this
evening
except
by
the
dim
rays
from
a
colored
lantern
in
the
shape
of
an
enormous
egg
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
the
long
window
was
open
allowing
at
times
a
fresh
breath
of
air
from
without
to
blow
upon
their
faces
for
the
evening
was
soft
and
warm
full
of
the
odor
of
springtime
they
said
nothing
but
held
each
other
hands
pressing
them
from
time
to
time
with
all
their
force
she
was
a
little
dismayed
by
this
great
change
in
her
life
but
smiling
emotional
ready
to
weep
often
ready
to
swoon
from
joy
believing
the
entire
world
changed
because
of
what
had
come
to
her
a
little
disturbed
without
knowing
the
reason
why
and
feeling
all
her
body
all
her
soul
enveloped
in
an
indefinable
delicious
lassitude
her
husband
she
watched
persistently
smiling
at
him
with
a
fixed
smile
he
wished
to
talk
but
found
nothing
to
say
and
remained
quiet
putting
all
his
ardor
into
the
pressure
of
the
hand
from
time
to
time
he
murmured
bertha
and
each
time
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
sweet
and
tender
look
they
would
look
at
each
other
a
moment
then
his
eyes
fascinated
by
hers
would
fall
they
discovered
no
thought
to
exchange
but
they
were
alone
except
as
a
dancing
couple
would
sometimes
cast
a
glance
at
them
in
passing
a
furtive
glance
as
if
it
were
the
discreet
and
confidential
witness
of
a
mystery
a
door
at
the
side
opened
a
domestic
entered
bearing
upon
a
tray
an
urgent
letter
which
a
messenger
had
brought
jack
trembled
as
he
took
it
seized
with
a
vague
and
sudden
fear
the
mysterious
abrupt
fear
of
misfortune
he
looked
long
at
the
envelope
not
knowing
the
handwriting
nor
daring
to
open
it
wishing
not
to
read
not
to
know
the
contents
desiring
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
to
say
to
himself
i
shall
be
far
away
and
it
will
not
matter
but
upon
the
corner
were
two
words
underlined
which
frightened
him
you
will
permit
me
my
dear
said
he
and
he
tore
off
the
wrapper
he
read
the
letter
growing
frightfully
pale
running
over
it
at
a
glance
and
then
seeming
to
spell
it
out
when
he
raised
his
head
his
whole
countenance
was
changed
he
stammered
my
dear
little
one
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
to
my
best
friend
he
needs
me
immediately
in
a
matter
of
of
life
and
death
allow
me
to
go
for
twenty
minutes
i
will
return
immediately
she
trembling
and
affrighted
murmured
go
my
friend
not
yet
being
enough
of
a
wife
to
dare
to
ask
or
demand
to
know
anything
and
he
disappeared
she
remained
alone
listening
to
the
dance
music
in
the
next
room
he
had
taken
a
hat
the
first
he
could
find
and
descended
the
staircase
upon
the
run
as
soon
as
he
was
mingled
with
the
people
on
the
street
he
stopped
under
a
gaslight
in
a
vestibule
and
the
letter
it
said
sir
the
ravet
girl
your
old
mistress
has
given
birth
to
a
child
which
she
asserts
is
yours
the
mother
is
dying
and
implores
you
to
visit
her
i
take
the
liberty
of
writing
to
you
to
ask
whether
you
will
grant
the
last
wish
of
this
woman
who
seems
to
be
very
unhappy
and
worthy
of
pity
your
servant
d
bonnard
when
he
entered
the
chamber
of
death
she
was
already
in
the
last
agony
he
would
not
have
known
her
the
physician
and
the
two
nurses
were
caring
for
her
dragging
across
the
room
some
buckets
full
of
ice
and
linen
water
covered
the
floor
two
tapers
were
burning
on
a
table
behind
the
bed
in
a
little
wicker
cradle
a
child
was
crying
and
with
each
of
its
cries
the
mother
would
try
to
move
shivering
under
the
icy
compresses
she
was
bleeding
wounded
to
death
killed
by
this
birth
her
life
was
slipping
away
and
in
spite
of
the
ice
in
spite
of
all
care
the
hemorrhage
continued
hastening
her
last
hour
she
recognized
jack
and
tried
to
raise
her
hand
she
was
too
weak
for
that
but
the
warm
tears
began
to
glide
down
her
cheeks
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
seized
one
of
her
hands
and
kissed
it
frantically
then
little
by
little
he
approached
nearer
to
the
wan
face
which
strained
to
meet
him
one
of
the
nurses
standing
with
a
taper
in
her
hand
observed
them
and
the
doctor
looked
at
them
from
the
remote
corner
of
the
room
with
a
voice
breathing
hard
she
said
i
am
going
to
die
my
dear
promise
me
you
will
remain
till
the
end
oh
do
not
leave
me
now
not
at
the
last
moment
he
kissed
her
brow
her
hair
with
a
groan
be
tranquil
he
murmured
i
will
stay
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
was
able
to
speak
again
she
was
so
weak
and
overcome
then
she
continued
it
is
yours
the
little
one
i
swear
it
before
god
i
swear
it
to
you
upon
my
soul
i
swear
it
at
the
moment
of
death
i
have
never
loved
any
man
but
you
promise
me
not
to
abandon
it
he
tried
to
take
in
his
arms
the
poor
weak
body
emptied
of
its
life
blood
he
stammered
excited
by
remorse
and
chagrin
i
swear
to
you
i
will
bring
it
up
and
love
it
it
shall
never
be
separated
from
me
then
she
held
jack
in
an
embrace
powerless
to
raise
her
head
she
held
up
her
blanched
lips
in
an
appeal
for
a
kiss
he
bent
his
mouth
to
receive
this
poor
suppliant
caress
calmed
a
little
she
murmured
in
a
low
tone
take
it
that
i
may
see
that
you
love
it
he
went
to
the
cradle
and
took
up
the
child
he
placed
it
gently
on
the
bed
between
them
the
little
creature
ceased
to
cry
she
whispered
do
not
stir
and
he
remained
motionless
there
he
stayed
holding
in
his
burning
palms
a
hand
that
shook
with
the
shiver
of
death
as
he
had
held
an
hour
before
another
hand
that
had
trembled
with
the
shiver
of
love
from
time
to
time
he
looked
at
the
hour
with
a
furtive
glance
of
the
eye
watching
the
hand
as
it
passed
midnight
then
one
then
two
the
doctor
retired
the
two
nurses
after
roaming
around
for
some
time
with
light
step
slept
now
in
their
chairs
the
child
slept
and
the
mother
whose
eyes
were
closed
seemed
to
be
resting
also
suddenly
as
the
pale
daylight
began
to
filter
through
the
torn
curtains
she
extended
her
arms
with
so
startling
and
violent
a
motion
that
she
almost
threw
the
child
upon
the
floor
there
was
a
rattling
in
her
throat
then
she
turned
over
motionless
dead
the
nurses
hastened
to
her
side
declaring
it
is
over
he
looked
once
at
this
woman
he
had
loved
then
at
the
hand
that
marked
four
and
forgetting
his
overcoat
fled
in
his
evening
clothes
with
the
child
in
his
arms
after
she
had
been
left
alone
his
young
bride
had
waited
calmly
at
first
in
the
japanese
boudoir
then
seeing
that
he
did
not
return
she
went
back
to
the
indifferent
and
tranquil
in
appearance
but
frightfully
disturbed
her
mother
perceiving
her
alone
asked
where
her
husband
was
she
replied
in
his
room
he
will
return
presently
at
the
end
of
an
hour
as
everybody
asked
about
him
she
told
of
the
letter
of
the
change
in
jack
face
and
her
fears
of
some
misfortune
they
still
waited
the
guests
had
gone
only
the
parents
and
near
relatives
remained
at
midnight
they
put
the
bride
in
her
bed
shaking
with
sobs
her
mother
and
two
aunts
were
seated
on
the
bed
listening
to
her
weeping
her
father
had
gone
to
the
police
headquarters
to
make
inquiries
at
five
a
light
sound
was
heard
in
the
corridor
the
door
opened
and
closed
softly
then
suddenly
a
cry
like
the
miauling
of
a
cat
went
through
the
house
breaking
the
silence
all
the
women
of
the
house
were
out
with
one
bound
and
bertha
was
the
first
to
spring
forward
in
spite
of
her
mother
and
her
aunts
clothed
only
in
her
jack
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
livid
breathing
hard
held
the
child
in
his
arms
the
four
women
looked
at
him
frightened
but
bertha
suddenly
became
rash
her
heart
wrung
with
anguish
and
ran
to
him
saying
what
is
it
what
have
you
there
he
had
a
foolish
air
and
answered
in
a
husky
voice
it
is
it
is
i
have
here
a
child
whose
mother
has
just
died
and
he
put
into
her
arms
the
howling
little
marmot
bertha
without
saying
a
word
seized
the
child
and
embraced
it
straining
it
to
her
heart
then
turning
toward
her
husband
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
she
said
the
mother
is
dead
you
say
he
answered
yes
just
died
in
my
arms
i
had
broken
with
her
since
last
summer
i
knew
nothing
about
it
only
the
doctor
sent
for
me
and
then
bertha
murmured
well
we
will
bring
up
this
little
one
forgiveness
she
had
been
brought
up
in
one
of
those
families
who
live
shut
up
within
themselves
entirely
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
they
pay
no
attention
to
political
events
except
to
chat
about
them
at
table
and
changes
in
government
seem
so
far
so
very
far
away
that
they
are
spoken
of
only
as
a
matter
of
history
like
the
death
of
louis
or
the
advent
of
napoleon
customs
change
fashions
succeed
each
other
but
changes
are
never
perceptible
in
this
family
where
old
traditions
are
always
followed
and
if
some
impossible
story
arises
in
the
neighborhood
the
scandal
of
it
dies
at
the
threshold
of
this
house
the
father
and
mother
alone
in
the
evening
sometimes
exchange
a
few
words
on
such
a
subject
but
in
an
undertone
as
if
the
walls
had
ears
with
great
discretion
the
father
says
do
you
know
about
this
terrible
affair
in
the
rivoil
family
and
the
mother
replies
who
would
have
believed
it
it
is
frightful
the
children
doubt
nothing
but
come
to
the
age
of
living
in
their
turn
with
a
bandage
over
their
eyes
and
minds
without
a
suspicion
of
any
other
kind
of
existence
without
knowing
that
one
does
not
always
think
as
he
speaks
nor
speak
as
he
acts
without
knowing
that
it
is
necessary
to
live
at
war
with
the
world
or
at
least
in
armed
peace
without
surmising
that
the
ingenuous
are
frequently
deceived
the
sincere
trifled
with
and
the
good
wronged
some
live
until
death
in
this
blindness
of
probity
loyalty
and
honor
so
upright
that
nothing
can
open
their
eyes
others
undeceived
without
knowing
much
are
weighed
down
with
despair
and
die
believing
that
they
are
the
puppets
of
an
exceptional
fatality
the
miserable
victims
of
unlucky
circumstance
or
particularly
bad
men
the
savignols
arranged
a
marriage
for
their
daughter
when
she
was
eighteen
she
married
a
young
man
from
paris
george
barton
whose
business
was
on
the
exchange
he
was
an
attractive
youth
with
a
smooth
tongue
and
he
observed
all
the
outward
proprieties
necessary
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
sneered
a
little
at
his
guileless
calling
them
among
his
friends
my
dear
fossils
he
belonged
to
a
good
family
and
the
young
girl
was
rich
he
took
her
to
live
in
paris
she
became
one
of
the
provincials
of
paris
of
whom
there
are
many
she
remained
ignorant
of
the
great
city
of
its
elegant
people
of
its
pleasures
and
its
customs
as
she
had
always
been
ignorant
of
the
perfidy
and
mystery
of
life
shut
up
in
her
own
household
she
scarcely
knew
the
street
she
lived
in
and
when
she
ventured
into
another
quarter
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
journeyed
far
into
an
unknown
strange
city
she
would
say
in
the
evening
i
crossed
the
boulevards
two
or
three
times
a
year
her
husband
took
her
to
the
theater
these
were
not
to
be
forgotten
which
she
recalled
continually
sometimes
at
table
three
months
afterward
she
would
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
exclaim
do
you
remember
that
ridiculous
actor
who
imitated
the
cock
crowing
all
her
interests
were
within
the
boundaries
of
the
two
allied
families
who
represented
the
whole
of
humanity
to
her
she
designated
them
by
the
distinguishing
prefix
the
calling
them
respectively
the
martinets
or
the
michelins
her
husband
lived
according
to
his
fancy
returning
whenever
he
wished
sometimes
at
daybreak
pretending
business
and
feeling
in
no
way
constrained
so
sure
was
he
that
no
suspicion
would
ruffle
this
candid
soul
but
one
morning
she
received
an
anonymous
letter
she
was
too
much
astonished
and
dismayed
to
scorn
this
letter
whose
author
declared
himself
to
be
moved
by
interest
in
her
happiness
by
hatred
of
all
evil
and
love
of
truth
her
heart
was
too
pure
to
understand
fully
the
meaning
of
the
accusations
but
it
revealed
to
her
that
her
husband
had
had
a
mistress
for
two
years
a
young
widow
rosset
at
whose
house
he
passed
his
evenings
she
knew
neither
how
to
pretend
nor
to
spy
nor
to
plan
any
sort
of
ruse
when
he
returned
for
luncheon
she
threw
him
the
letter
sobbing
and
then
fled
to
her
room
he
had
time
to
comprehend
the
matter
and
prepare
his
response
before
he
rapped
at
his
wife
door
she
opened
it
immediately
without
looking
at
him
he
smiled
sat
down
and
drew
her
to
his
knee
in
a
sweet
voice
and
a
little
jocosely
he
said
my
dear
little
one
rosset
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
have
known
her
for
ten
years
and
like
her
very
much
i
may
add
that
i
know
twenty
other
families
of
whom
i
have
not
spoken
to
you
knowing
that
you
care
nothing
for
the
world
or
for
forming
new
friendships
but
in
order
to
finish
once
for
all
these
infamous
lies
i
will
ask
you
to
dress
yourself
after
luncheon
and
we
will
go
to
pay
a
visit
to
this
young
lady
who
will
become
your
friend
at
once
i
am
sure
she
embraced
her
husband
eagerly
and
from
feminine
curiosity
which
no
sooner
sleeps
than
wakes
again
she
did
not
refuse
to
go
to
see
this
unknown
woman
of
whom
in
spite
of
all
she
was
still
suspicious
she
felt
by
instinct
that
a
known
danger
is
sooner
overcome
they
were
ushered
into
a
little
apartment
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
handsome
house
it
was
a
coquettish
little
place
full
of
and
ornamented
with
works
of
art
after
about
five
minutes
waiting
in
a
where
the
light
was
dimmed
by
its
generous
window
draperies
and
portières
a
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
appeared
she
was
very
dark
small
rather
plump
and
looked
astonished
although
she
smiled
george
presented
them
my
wife
madame
julie
rosset
the
young
widow
uttered
a
little
cry
of
astonishment
and
joy
and
came
forward
with
both
hands
extended
she
had
not
hoped
for
this
happiness
she
said
knowing
that
madame
barton
saw
no
one
but
she
was
so
happy
she
was
so
fond
of
george
she
said
george
quite
naturally
with
sisterly
familiarity
and
she
had
had
great
desire
to
know
his
young
wife
and
to
love
her
too
at
the
end
of
a
month
these
two
friends
were
never
apart
from
each
other
they
met
every
day
often
twice
a
day
and
nearly
always
dined
together
either
at
one
house
or
at
the
other
george
scarcely
ever
went
out
now
no
longer
pretended
delay
on
account
of
business
but
said
he
loved
his
own
chimney
corner
finally
an
apartment
was
left
vacant
in
the
house
where
madame
rosset
resided
madame
barton
hastened
to
take
it
in
order
to
be
nearer
her
new
friend
during
two
whole
years
there
was
a
friendship
between
them
without
a
cloud
a
friendship
of
heart
and
soul
tender
devoted
and
delightful
bertha
could
not
speak
without
mentioning
julie
name
for
to
her
julie
represented
perfection
she
was
happy
with
a
perfect
happiness
calm
and
secure
but
madame
rosset
fell
bertha
never
left
her
she
passed
nights
of
despair
her
husband
too
was
one
morning
in
going
out
from
his
visit
the
doctor
took
george
and
his
wife
aside
and
announced
that
he
found
the
condition
of
their
friend
very
grave
when
he
had
gone
out
the
young
people
stricken
down
looked
at
each
other
and
then
began
to
weep
they
both
watched
that
night
near
the
bed
bertha
would
embrace
the
sick
one
tenderly
while
george
standing
silently
at
the
foot
of
her
couch
would
look
at
them
with
dogged
persistence
the
next
day
she
was
worse
finally
toward
evening
she
declared
herself
better
and
persuaded
her
friends
to
go
home
to
dinner
they
were
sitting
sadly
at
table
scarcely
eating
anything
when
the
maid
brought
george
an
envelope
he
opened
it
turned
pale
and
rising
said
to
his
wife
in
a
constrained
way
excuse
me
i
must
leave
you
for
a
moment
i
will
return
in
ten
minutes
please
do
go
out
and
he
ran
into
his
room
for
his
hat
bertha
waited
tortured
by
a
new
fear
but
yielding
in
all
things
she
would
not
go
up
to
her
friend
room
again
until
he
had
returned
as
he
did
not
the
thought
came
to
her
to
look
in
his
room
to
see
whether
he
had
taken
his
gloves
which
would
show
whether
he
had
really
gone
somewhere
she
saw
them
there
at
first
glance
near
them
lay
a
rumpled
paper
she
recognized
it
immediately
it
was
the
one
that
had
called
george
away
and
a
burning
temptation
took
possession
of
her
the
first
of
her
life
to
read
to
know
her
conscience
struggled
in
revolt
but
curiosity
lashed
her
on
and
grief
directed
her
hand
she
seized
the
paper
opened
it
recognized
the
trembling
handwriting
as
that
of
julie
and
read
come
alone
and
embrace
me
my
poor
friend
i
am
going
to
die
she
could
not
understand
it
all
at
once
but
stood
stupefied
struck
especially
by
the
thought
of
death
then
suddenly
the
familiarity
of
it
seized
upon
her
mind
this
came
like
a
great
light
illuminating
her
whole
life
showing
her
the
infamous
truth
all
their
treachery
all
their
perfidy
she
saw
now
their
cunning
their
sly
looks
her
good
faith
played
with
her
confidence
turned
to
account
she
saw
them
looking
into
each
other
faces
under
the
shade
of
her
lamp
at
evening
reading
from
the
same
book
exchanging
glances
at
the
end
of
certain
pages
and
her
heart
stirred
with
indignation
bruised
with
suffering
sunk
into
an
abyss
of
despair
that
had
no
boundaries
when
she
heard
steps
she
fled
and
shut
herself
in
her
room
her
husband
called
her
come
quickly
madame
rosset
is
dying
bertha
appeared
at
her
door
and
said
with
trembling
lip
go
alone
to
her
she
has
no
need
of
me
he
looked
at
her
sheepishly
careless
from
anger
and
repeated
quick
quick
she
is
dying
bertha
answered
you
would
prefer
it
to
be
i
then
he
understood
probably
and
left
her
to
herself
going
up
again
to
the
dying
one
there
he
wept
without
fear
or
shame
indifferent
to
the
grief
of
his
wife
who
would
no
longer
speak
to
him
nor
look
at
him
but
who
lived
shut
in
with
her
disgust
and
angry
revolt
praying
to
god
morning
and
evening
they
lived
together
nevertheless
eating
together
face
to
face
mute
and
hopeless
after
a
time
he
tried
to
appease
her
a
little
but
she
would
not
forget
and
so
the
life
continued
hard
for
them
both
for
a
whole
year
they
lived
thus
strangers
one
to
the
other
bertha
almost
became
mad
then
one
morning
having
set
out
at
dawn
she
returned
toward
eight
carrying
in
both
hands
an
enormous
bouquet
of
roses
of
white
roses
all
white
she
sent
word
to
her
husband
that
she
would
like
to
speak
to
him
he
came
in
disturbed
troubled
let
us
go
out
together
she
said
to
him
take
these
flowers
they
are
too
heavy
for
me
he
took
the
bouquet
and
followed
his
wife
a
carriage
awaited
them
which
started
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
it
stopped
before
the
gate
of
a
cemetery
then
bertha
her
eyes
full
of
tears
said
to
george
take
me
to
her
grave
he
trembled
without
knowing
why
but
walked
on
before
holding
the
flowers
in
his
arms
finally
he
stopped
before
a
shaft
of
white
marble
and
pointed
to
it
without
a
word
she
took
the
bouquet
from
him
and
kneeling
placed
it
at
the
foot
of
the
grave
then
her
heart
was
raised
in
suppliant
silent
prayer
her
husband
stood
behind
her
weeping
haunted
by
memories
she
arose
and
put
out
her
hands
to
him
if
you
wish
we
will
be
friends
she
said
the
white
wolf
this
is
the
story
the
old
marquis
told
us
after
a
dinner
in
honor
of
at
the
house
of
baron
des
ravels
they
had
run
down
a
stag
that
day
the
marquis
was
the
only
one
of
the
guests
who
had
not
taken
part
in
the
chase
he
never
hunted
during
the
whole
of
the
long
repast
they
had
talked
of
scarcely
anything
but
the
massacre
of
animals
even
the
ladies
interested
themselves
in
the
sanguinary
and
often
unlikely
stories
while
the
orators
mimicked
the
attacks
and
combats
between
man
and
beast
raising
their
arms
and
speaking
in
thunderous
tones
talked
much
with
a
certain
poesy
a
little
flourish
but
full
of
effect
he
must
have
repeated
this
story
often
it
ran
so
smoothly
never
halting
at
a
choice
of
words
in
which
to
clothe
an
image
gentlemen
i
never
hunt
nor
did
my
father
nor
my
grandfather
nor
my
the
last
named
was
the
son
of
a
man
who
hunted
more
than
all
of
you
he
died
in
i
will
tell
you
how
he
was
named
john
and
was
married
and
became
the
father
of
the
man
who
was
my
he
lived
with
his
younger
brother
francis
in
our
castle
in
the
midst
of
a
deep
forest
in
lorraine
francis
always
remained
a
boy
through
his
love
for
hunting
they
both
hunted
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
without
cessation
or
weariness
they
loved
nothing
else
understood
nothing
else
talked
only
of
this
and
lived
for
this
alone
they
were
possessed
by
this
terrible
inexorable
passion
it
consumed
them
having
taken
entire
control
of
them
leaving
no
place
for
anything
else
they
had
agreed
not
to
put
off
the
chase
for
any
reason
whatsoever
my
was
born
while
his
father
was
following
a
fox
but
john
did
not
interrupt
his
sport
and
swore
that
the
little
beggar
might
have
waited
until
after
the
his
brother
francis
showed
himself
still
more
than
he
the
first
thing
on
rising
he
would
go
to
see
the
dogs
then
the
horses
then
he
would
shoot
some
birds
about
the
place
even
when
about
to
set
out
hunting
big
game
they
were
called
in
the
country
monsieur
the
marquis
and
monsieur
the
cadet
noblemen
then
not
acting
as
do
those
of
our
time
who
wish
to
establish
in
their
titles
a
descending
scale
of
rank
for
the
son
of
a
marquis
is
no
more
a
count
or
the
son
of
a
viscount
a
baron
than
the
son
of
a
general
is
a
colonel
by
birth
but
the
niggardly
vanity
of
the
day
finds
profit
in
this
arrangement
to
return
to
my
ancestors
they
were
it
appears
immoderately
large
bony
hairy
violent
and
vigorous
the
younger
one
was
taller
than
the
elder
and
had
such
a
voice
that
according
to
a
legend
he
was
very
proud
of
all
the
leaves
of
the
forest
moved
when
he
shouted
and
when
mounted
ready
for
the
chase
it
must
have
been
a
superb
sight
to
see
these
two
giants
astride
their
great
horses
toward
the
middle
of
the
winter
of
that
year
the
cold
was
excessive
and
the
wolves
became
ferocious
they
even
attacked
belated
peasants
roamed
around
houses
at
night
howled
from
sunset
to
sunrise
and
ravaged
the
stables
at
one
time
a
rumor
was
circulated
it
was
said
that
a
colossal
wolf
of
color
which
had
eaten
two
children
devoured
the
arm
of
a
woman
strangled
all
the
watchdogs
of
the
country
was
now
coming
without
fear
into
the
house
inclosures
and
smelling
around
the
doors
many
inhabitants
affirmed
that
they
had
felt
his
breath
which
made
the
lights
flicker
shortly
a
panic
ran
through
all
the
province
no
one
dared
to
go
out
after
nightfall
the
very
shadows
seemed
haunted
by
the
image
of
this
beast
the
brothers
resolved
to
find
and
slay
him
so
they
called
together
for
a
grand
chase
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
it
was
in
vain
they
had
beaten
the
forests
and
scoured
the
thickets
but
had
seen
nothing
of
him
they
killed
wolves
but
not
that
one
and
each
night
after
such
a
chase
the
beast
as
if
to
avenge
himself
attacked
some
traveler
or
devoured
some
cattle
always
far
from
the
place
where
they
had
sought
him
finally
one
night
he
found
a
way
into
the
of
the
castle
and
ate
two
beauties
of
the
best
breed
the
two
brothers
were
furious
interpreting
the
attack
as
one
of
bravado
on
the
part
of
the
monster
a
direct
injury
a
defiance
therefore
taking
all
their
hounds
they
set
out
to
run
down
the
beast
with
courage
excited
by
anger
from
dawn
until
the
sun
descended
behind
the
great
they
beat
about
the
forests
with
no
result
at
last
both
of
them
angry
and
disheartened
turned
their
steps
into
a
bypath
bordered
by
brushwood
they
were
marveling
at
the
baffling
power
of
this
wolf
when
suddenly
they
were
seized
with
a
mysterious
fear
the
elder
said
can
be
no
ordinary
beast
one
might
say
he
can
think
like
a
man
the
younger
replied
we
should
get
our
cousin
the
bishop
to
bless
a
bullet
for
him
or
ask
a
priest
to
pronounce
some
words
to
help
us
then
they
were
silent
john
continued
at
the
sun
how
red
it
is
the
great
wolf
will
do
mischief
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
his
horse
reared
horse
started
to
run
at
the
same
time
a
large
bush
covered
with
dead
leaves
rose
before
them
and
a
colossal
beast
grayish
white
sprang
out
scampering
away
through
the
wood
both
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
bending
to
the
necks
of
their
heavy
horses
they
urged
them
on
with
the
weight
of
their
bodies
exciting
them
hastening
with
voice
and
spur
until
these
strong
riders
seemed
to
carry
the
weight
of
their
beasts
between
their
knees
carrying
them
by
force
as
if
they
were
flying
thus
they
rode
crashing
through
forests
crossing
ravines
climbing
up
the
sides
of
steep
gorges
and
sounding
the
horn
at
frequent
intervals
to
arouse
the
people
and
the
dogs
of
the
neighborhood
but
suddenly
in
the
course
of
this
breakneck
ride
my
ancestor
struck
his
forehead
against
a
large
branch
and
fractured
his
skull
he
fell
to
the
ground
as
if
dead
while
his
frightened
horse
disappeared
in
the
surrounding
thicket
the
younger
stopped
short
sprang
to
the
ground
seized
his
brother
in
his
arms
and
saw
that
he
had
lost
consciousness
he
sat
down
beside
him
took
his
disfigured
head
upon
his
knees
looking
earnestly
at
the
lifeless
face
little
by
little
a
fear
crept
over
him
a
strange
fear
that
he
had
never
before
felt
fear
of
the
shadows
of
the
solitude
of
the
lonely
woods
and
also
of
the
chimerical
wolf
which
had
now
come
to
be
the
death
of
his
brother
the
shadows
deepened
the
branches
of
the
trees
crackled
in
the
sharp
cold
francis
arose
shivering
incapable
of
remaining
there
longer
and
already
feeling
his
strength
fail
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
neither
the
voice
of
dogs
nor
the
sound
of
a
horn
all
within
this
invisible
horizon
was
mute
and
in
this
gloomy
silence
and
the
chill
of
evening
there
was
something
strange
and
frightful
with
his
powerful
hands
he
seized
john
body
and
laid
it
across
the
saddle
to
take
it
home
then
mounted
gently
behind
it
his
mind
troubled
by
horrible
supernatural
images
as
if
he
were
possessed
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
these
fears
a
great
form
passed
it
was
the
wolf
a
violent
fit
of
terror
seized
upon
the
hunter
something
cold
like
a
stream
of
seemed
to
glide
through
his
veins
and
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
like
a
monk
haunted
with
devils
so
dismayed
was
he
by
the
reappearance
of
the
frightful
wanderer
then
his
eyes
falling
upon
the
inert
body
before
him
his
fear
was
quickly
changed
to
anger
and
he
trembled
with
inordinate
rage
he
pricked
his
horse
and
darted
after
him
he
followed
him
through
copses
over
ravines
and
around
great
forest
trees
traversing
woods
that
he
no
longer
recognized
his
eye
fixed
upon
a
white
spot
which
was
ever
flying
from
him
as
night
covered
the
earth
his
horse
also
seemed
moved
by
an
unknown
force
he
galloped
on
with
neck
extended
crashing
over
small
trees
and
rocks
with
the
body
of
the
dead
stretched
across
him
on
the
saddle
brambles
caught
in
his
mane
his
head
where
it
had
struck
the
trunks
of
trees
was
spattered
with
blood
the
marks
of
the
spurs
were
over
his
flanks
suddenly
the
animal
and
its
rider
came
out
of
the
forest
rushing
through
a
valley
as
the
moon
appeared
above
the
hills
this
valley
was
stony
and
shut
in
by
enormous
rocks
over
which
it
was
impossible
to
pass
there
was
no
other
way
for
the
wolf
but
to
turn
on
his
steps
francis
gave
such
a
shout
of
joy
and
revenge
that
the
echo
of
it
was
like
the
roll
of
thunder
he
leaped
from
his
horse
knife
in
hand
the
bristling
beast
with
rounded
back
was
awaiting
him
his
eyes
shining
like
two
stars
but
before
joining
in
battle
the
strong
hunter
grasping
his
brother
seated
him
upon
a
rock
supporting
his
head
which
was
now
but
a
mass
of
blood
with
stones
and
cried
aloud
to
him
as
to
one
deaf
john
look
here
then
he
threw
himself
upon
the
monster
he
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
overthrow
a
mountain
to
crush
the
very
rocks
in
his
hands
the
beast
meant
to
kill
him
by
sinking
his
claws
in
his
vitals
but
the
man
had
seized
him
by
the
throat
without
even
making
use
of
his
weapon
and
strangled
him
gently
waiting
until
his
breath
stopped
and
he
could
hear
the
at
his
heart
and
he
laughed
with
the
joy
of
dismay
clutching
more
and
more
with
a
terrible
hold
and
crying
out
in
his
delirium
john
look
all
resistance
ceased
the
body
of
the
wolf
was
limp
he
was
dead
then
francis
taking
him
in
his
arms
threw
him
down
at
the
feet
of
his
elder
brother
crying
out
in
expectant
voice
here
my
little
john
here
he
is
then
he
placed
upon
the
saddle
the
two
bodies
the
one
above
the
other
and
started
on
his
way
he
returned
to
the
castle
laughing
and
weeping
like
gargantua
at
the
birth
of
pantagruel
shouting
in
triumph
and
stamping
with
delight
in
relating
the
death
of
the
beast
and
moaning
and
tearing
at
his
beard
in
calling
the
name
of
his
brother
often
later
when
he
recalled
this
day
he
would
declare
with
tears
in
his
eyes
only
poor
john
had
seen
me
strangle
the
beast
he
would
have
died
content
i
am
sure
the
widow
of
my
ancestor
inspired
in
her
son
a
horror
of
the
chase
which
was
transmitted
from
father
to
son
down
to
myself
the
marquis
was
silent
some
one
asked
is
the
story
a
legend
or
not
and
the
narrator
replied
i
swear
to
you
it
is
true
from
beginning
to
end
then
a
lady
in
a
sweet
little
voice
declared
it
is
beautiful
to
have
passions
like
that
